conclusion
introduction
dear
on
whose
ample
breast
the
hungry
still
find
food
the
weary
rest
the
child
of
want
that
treads
thy
happy
shore
shall
feel
the
grasp
of
poverty
no
more
his
honest
toil
meet
recompense
can
claim
and
freedom
bless
him
with
a
freeman
name
in
our
work
of
roughing
it
in
the
bush
i
endeavoured
to
draw
a
picture
of
canadian
life
as
i
found
it
twenty
years
ago
in
the
backwoods
my
motive
in
giving
such
a
melancholy
narrative
to
the
british
public
was
prompted
by
the
hope
of
deterring
people
about
to
settle
in
this
colony
from
entering
upon
a
life
for
which
they
were
totally
unfitted
by
their
previous
pursuits
and
habits
to
persons
unaccustomed
to
hard
labour
and
used
to
the
comforts
and
luxuries
deemed
indispensable
to
those
moving
in
the
middle
classes
at
home
a
settlement
in
the
bush
can
offer
few
advantages
it
has
proved
the
ruin
of
hundreds
and
thousands
who
have
ventured
their
all
in
this
hazardous
experiment
nor
can
i
recollect
a
single
family
of
the
higher
class
that
have
come
under
my
own
personal
knowledge
that
ever
realised
an
independence
or
bettered
their
condition
by
taking
up
wild
lands
in
remote
localities
while
volumes
might
be
filled
with
failures
even
more
disastrous
than
our
own
to
prove
the
truth
of
my
former
statements
but
while
i
have
endeavoured
to
point
out
the
error
of
gentlemen
bringing
delicate
women
and
helpless
children
to
toil
in
the
woods
and
by
so
doing
excluding
them
from
all
social
intercourse
with
persons
in
their
own
rank
and
depriving
the
younger
branches
of
the
family
of
the
advantages
of
education
which
in
the
vicinity
of
towns
and
villages
can
be
enjoyed
by
the
children
of
the
poorest
emigrant
i
have
never
said
anything
against
the
real
benefits
to
be
derived
from
a
judicious
choice
of
settlement
in
this
great
and
rising
country
god
forbid
that
any
representations
of
mine
should
deter
one
of
my
countrymen
from
making
this
noble
and
prosperous
colony
his
future
home
but
let
him
leave
to
the
hardy
labourer
the
place
assigned
to
him
by
providence
nor
undertake
upon
limited
means
the
task
of
pioneer
in
the
great
wilderness
men
of
independent
fortune
can
live
anywhere
if
such
prefer
a
life
in
the
woods
to
the
woods
let
them
go
but
they
will
soon
find
out
that
they
could
have
employed
the
means
in
their
power
in
a
far
more
profitable
manner
than
in
chopping
down
trees
in
the
bush
there
are
a
thousand
more
advantageous
ways
in
which
a
man
of
property
may
invest
his
capital
than
by
burying
himself
and
his
family
in
the
woods
there
never
was
a
period
in
the
history
of
the
colony
that
offered
greater
inducements
to
men
of
moderate
means
to
emigrate
to
canada
than
the
present
the
many
and
railways
in
the
course
of
construction
in
the
province
while
they
afford
high
and
remunerative
wages
to
the
working
classes
will
amply
repay
the
speculator
who
embarks
a
portion
of
his
means
in
purchasing
shares
in
them
and
if
he
is
bent
upon
becoming
a
canadian
farmer
numbers
of
fine
farms
in
healthy
and
eligible
situations
and
in
the
vicinity
of
good
markets
are
to
be
had
on
moderate
terms
that
would
amply
repay
the
cultivator
for
the
money
and
labour
expended
upon
them
there
are
thousands
of
independent
proprietors
of
this
class
in
canada
men
who
move
in
the
best
society
and
whose
names
have
a
political
weight
in
the
country
why
gentlemen
from
britain
should
obstinately
crowd
to
the
backwoods
and
prefer
the
coarse
hard
life
of
an
axeman
to
that
of
a
respectable
landed
proprietor
in
a
civilised
part
of
the
country
has
always
been
to
me
a
matter
of
surprise
for
a
farm
under
cultivation
can
always
be
purchased
for
less
money
than
must
necessarily
be
expended
upon
clearing
and
raising
buildings
upon
a
wild
lot
many
young
men
are
attracted
to
the
backwoods
by
the
facilities
they
present
for
hunting
and
fishing
the
wild
free
life
of
the
hunter
has
for
an
ardent
and
romantic
temperament
an
inexpressible
charm
but
hunting
and
fishing
however
fascinating
as
a
wholesome
relaxation
from
labour
will
not
win
bread
or
clothe
a
wife
and
shivering
little
ones
and
those
who
give
themselves
entirely
up
to
such
pursuits
soon
add
to
these
profitless
accomplishments
the
bush
vices
of
smoking
and
drinking
and
quickly
throw
off
those
moral
restraints
upon
which
their
respectability
and
future
welfare
mainly
depend
the
bush
is
the
most
demoralizing
place
to
which
an
anxious
and
prudent
parent
could
send
a
young
lad
freed
suddenly
from
all
parental
control
and
exposed
to
the
contaminating
influence
of
gentlemen
loafers
who
hide
their
pride
and
poverty
in
the
woods
he
joins
in
their
low
debauchery
and
falsely
imagines
that
by
becoming
a
blackguard
he
will
be
considered
an
excellent
backwoodsman
how
many
fine
young
men
have
i
seen
beggared
and
ruined
in
the
bush
it
is
too
much
the
custom
in
the
woods
for
the
idle
settler
who
will
not
work
to
live
upon
the
new
comer
as
long
as
he
can
give
him
good
fare
and
his
horn
of
whisky
when
these
fail
farewell
to
your
roystering
friends
they
will
leave
you
like
a
swarm
of
musquitoes
while
you
fret
over
your
festering
wounds
and
fly
to
suck
the
blood
of
some
new
settler
who
is
fool
enough
to
believe
their
offers
of
friendship
the
dreadful
vice
of
drunkenness
of
which
i
shall
have
occasion
to
speak
hereafter
is
nowhere
displayed
in
more
revolting
colours
or
occurs
more
frequently
than
in
the
bush
nor
is
it
exhibited
by
the
lower
classes
in
so
shameless
a
manner
as
by
the
gentlemen
settlers
from
whom
a
better
example
might
be
expected
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
point
out
the
causes
which
too
often
lead
to
these
melancholy
results
loss
of
property
incapacity
for
hard
labour
yielding
the
mind
to
low
and
degrading
vices
which
destroy
and
paralyse
honest
exertion
and
the
annihilation
of
those
extravagant
hopes
that
false
statements
made
by
interested
parties
had
led
them
to
entertain
of
fortunes
that
might
be
realised
in
the
woods
these
are
a
few
among
the
many
reasons
that
could
be
given
for
the
number
of
victims
that
yearly
fill
a
drunkard
dishonourable
grave
at
the
period
when
the
greatest
portion
of
roughing
it
in
the
bush
was
written
i
was
totally
ignorant
of
life
in
canada
as
it
existed
in
the
towns
and
villages
thirteen
years
residence
in
one
of
the
most
thriving
districts
in
the
upper
province
has
given
me
many
opportunities
of
becoming
better
acquainted
with
the
manners
and
habits
of
her
busy
bustling
population
than
it
was
possible
for
me
ever
to
obtain
in
the
green
prison
of
the
woods
since
my
residence
in
a
settled
part
of
the
country
i
have
enjoyed
as
much
domestic
peace
and
happiness
as
ever
falls
to
the
lot
of
poor
humanity
canada
has
become
almost
as
dear
to
me
as
my
native
land
and
the
homesickness
that
constantly
preyed
upon
me
in
the
backwoods
has
long
ago
yielded
to
the
deepest
and
most
heartfelt
interest
in
the
rapidly
increasing
prosperity
and
greatness
of
the
country
of
my
adoption
the
great
of
that
portion
of
the
human
family
whose
fatherland
however
dear
to
them
is
unable
to
supply
them
with
bread
to
the
honest
sons
of
labour
canada
is
indeed
an
el
dorado
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
for
they
soon
obtain
that
independence
which
the
poor
gentleman
struggles
in
vain
to
realise
by
his
own
labour
in
the
woods
the
conventional
prejudices
that
shackle
the
movements
of
members
of
the
higher
classes
in
britain
are
scarcely
recognised
in
canada
and
a
man
is
at
liberty
to
choose
the
most
profitable
manner
of
acquiring
wealth
without
the
fear
of
ridicule
and
the
loss
of
caste
the
friendly
relations
which
now
exist
between
us
and
our
enterprising
intelligent
american
neighbours
have
doubtless
done
much
to
produce
this
amalgamation
of
classes
the
gentleman
no
longer
looks
down
with
supercilious
on
the
wealthy
merchant
nor
does
the
latter
refuse
to
the
ingenious
mechanic
the
respect
due
to
him
as
a
man
a
more
healthy
state
pervades
canadian
society
than
existed
here
a
few
years
ago
when
party
feeling
ran
high
and
the
professional
men
and
office
holders
visited
exclusively
among
themselves
affecting
airs
of
aristocratic
superiority
which
were
perfectly
absurd
in
a
new
country
and
which
gave
great
offence
to
those
of
equal
wealth
who
were
not
admitted
into
their
clique
though
too
much
of
this
spirit
exists
in
the
large
cities
such
as
quebec
montreal
and
toronto
it
would
not
be
tolerated
in
the
small
district
towns
and
villages
where
a
gentleman
could
not
take
a
surer
method
of
making
himself
unpopular
than
by
exhibiting
this
feeling
to
his
i
have
been
repeatedly
asked
since
the
publication
of
roughing
it
in
the
bush
to
give
an
account
of
the
present
state
of
society
in
the
colony
and
to
point
out
its
increasing
prosperity
and
commercial
advantages
but
statistics
are
not
my
forte
nor
do
i
feel
myself
qualified
for
such
an
arduous
and
important
task
my
knowledge
of
the
colony
is
too
limited
to
enable
me
to
write
a
comprehensive
work
on
a
subject
of
vital
consequence
which
might
involve
the
happiness
of
others
but
what
i
do
know
i
will
endeavour
to
sketch
with
a
light
pencil
and
if
i
can
not
convey
much
useful
information
i
will
try
to
amuse
the
reader
and
by
a
mixture
of
prose
and
poetry
compile
a
small
volume
which
may
help
to
while
away
an
idle
hour
or
fill
up
the
blanks
of

year

during
twenty
years
residence
in

i
had
indulged
the
hope
of
one
day
visiting
the
falls
of
niagara
and
year
after
year
for
twenty
long
years
i
was
doomed
to
disappointment
for
the
first
ten
years
my
residence
in
the
woods
of
douro
my
infant
family
and
last
not
least
among
the
list
of
objections
that
great
want
the
want
of
money
placed
insuperable
difficulties
in
the
way
of
my
ever
accomplishing
this
cherished
wish
of
my
heart
the
hope
resigned
for
the
present
was
always
indulged
as
a
bright
future
a
pleasant
an
event
which
at
some
unknown
period
when
happier
days
should
dawn
upon
us
might
take
place
but
which
just
now
was
entirely
out
of
the
question
when
the
children
were
very
importunate
for
a
new
book
or
toy
and
i
had
not
the
means
of
gratifying
them
i
used
to
silence
them
by
saying
that
i
would
buy
that
and
many
other
nice
things
for
them
when
our
money
cart
came
home
during
the
next
ten
years
this
and
anxiously
anticipated
vehicle
did
not
arrive
the
children
did
not
get
their
toys
and
my
journey
to
niagara
was
still
postponed
to
an
indefinite
period
like
a
true
daughter
of
romance
i
could
not
banish
from
my
mind
the
glorious
ideal
i
had
formed
of
this
wonder
of
the
world
but
still
continued
to
speculate
about
the
mighty
cataract
that
sublime
thunder
of
waters
whose
very
name
from
childhood
had
been
music
to
my
ears
ah
hope
what
would
life
be
stripped
of
thy
encouraging
smiles
that
teach
us
to
look
behind
the
dark
clouds
of
for
the
golden
beams
that
are
to
gild
the
morrow
to
those
who
have
faith
in
thy
promises
the
most
extravagant
fictions
are
possible
and
the
unreal
becomes
material
and
tangible
the
artist
who
placed
thee
upon
the
rock
with
an
anchor
for
a
leaning
post
could
never
have
experienced
any
of
thy
vagrant
propensities
he
should
have
invested
thee
with
the
rainbow
of
iris
the
winged
feet
of
mercury
and
the
upward
pointing
finger
of
faith
and
as
for
thy
footstool
it
should
be
a
fleecy
white
cloud
changing
its
form
with
the
changing
breeze
yet
this
hope
of
mine
of
one
day
seeing
the
falls
of
niagara
was
after
all
a
very
enduring
hope
for
though
i
began
to
fear
that
it
never
would
be
realized
yet
for
twenty
years
i
never
gave
it
up
entirely
and
patience
who
always
sits
at
the
feet
of
hope
was
at
length
rewarded
by
her
sister
consenting
smile
during
the
past
summer
i
was
confined
by
severe
indisposition
almost
entirely
to
the
house
the
obstinate
nature
of
my
disease
baffled
the
skill
of
a
very
clever
medical
attendant
and
created
alarm
and
uneasiness
in
my
family
and
i
entertained
small
hopes
of
my
own
recovery
l
as
a
last
resource
recommended
change
of
air
and
scene
a
remedy
far
more
to
my
taste
than
the
odious
drugs
from
which
i
had
not
derived
the
least
benefit
ill
and
languid
as
i
was
niagara
once
more
rose
before
my
mental
vision
and
i
exclaimed
with
a
thrill
of
joy
the
time
is
come
at
last
i
shall
yet
see
it
before
i
die
my
dear
husband
was
to
be
the
companion
of
my
long
journey
in
search
of
health
our
simple
arrangements
were
soon
made
and
on
the
of
september
we
left
belleville
in
the
handsome
new
the
bay
of
quinte
for
kingston
the
afternoon
was
cloudless
the
woods
just
tinged
with
their
first
autumnal
glow
and
the
lovely
bay
and
its
fairy
isles
never
appeared
more
enchanting
in
my
eyes
often
as
i
had
gazed
upon
it
in
storm
and
shine
its
blue
transparent
waters
seemed
to
smile
upon
me
more
lovingly
than
usual
with
affectionate
interest
i
looked
long
and
tenderly
upon
the
shores
we
were
leaving
there
stood
my
peaceful
happy
home
the
haven
of
rest
to
which
providence
had
conducted
me
after
the
storms
and
trials
of
many
years
within
the
walls
of
that
small
stone
cottage
peeping
forth
from
its
screen
of
young
hickory
trees
i
had
left
three
dear
children
god
only
could
tell
whether
we
should
ever
meet
on
earth
again
i
knew
that
their
prayers
would
follow
me
on
my
long
journey
and
the
cherub
hope
was
still
at
my
side
to
whisper
of
happy
hours
and
restored
health
and
spirits
i
blessed
god
for
the
love
of
those
young
kindred
hearts
and
for
having
placed
their
home
in
such
a
charming
locality
next
to
the
love
of
god
the
love
of
nature
may
be
regarded
as
the
purest
and
holiest
feeling
of
the
human
breast
in
the
outward
beauty
of
his
creation
we
catch
a
reflection
of
the
divine
image
of
the
creator
which
refines
the
intellect
and
lifts
the
soul
upward
to
him
this
innate
perception
of
the
beautiful
however
is
confined
to
no
rank
or
situation
but
is
found
in
the
most
barren
spots
and
surrounded
by
the
most
unfavourable
circumstances
wherever
the
sun
shines
and
warms
or
the
glory
of
the
moon
and
stars
can
be
seen
at
night
the
children
of
genius
will
find
a
revelation
of
god
in
their
beams
but
there
is
not
a
doubt
that
those
born
and
brought
up
among
scenes
of
great
natural
sublimity
and
beauty
imbibe
this
feeling
in
a
larger
degree
and
their
minds
are
more
easily
imbued
with
the
glorious
colouring
of
romance
the
inspired
visions
of
the
poet
dear
patient
reader
whether
of
british
or
canadian
origin
as
i
wish
to
afford
you
all
the
amusement
in
my
power
deign
to
accompany
me
on
my
long
journey
allow
me
a
woman
privilege
of
talking
of
all
sorts
of
things
by
the
way
should
i
tire
you
with
my
desultory
mode
of
conversation
bear
with
me
charitably
and
take
into
account
the
infirmities
incidental
to
my
gossiping
sex
and
age
if
i
dwell
too
long
upon
some
subjects
do
not
call
me
a
bore
or
vain
and
trifling
if
i
pass
too
lightly
over
others
the
little
knowledge
i
possess
i
impart
freely
and
wish
that
it
was
more
profound
and
extensive
for
your
sake
come
and
take
your
seat
with
me
on
the
deck
of
the
steamer
and
as
we
glide
over
the
waters
of
this
beautiful
bay
of
quinte
i
will
make
you
acquainted
with
every
spot
worthy
of
note
along
its
picturesque
shores
an
english
lady
writing
to
me
not
long
ago
expressed
her
weariness
of
my
long
stories
about
the
country
of
my
adoption
in
the
following
terms
do
fill
your
letters
to
me
with
descriptions
of
canada
who
thinks
anything
of
here
the
pride
so
common
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
favoured
isles
spoke
out
this
is
perhaps
excusable
in
those
who
boast
that
they
belong
to
a
country
that
possesses
in
an
eminent
degree
the
attributes
bestowed
by
old
jacob
on
his
the
excellency
of
dignity
and
the
excellency
of
power
but
to
my
own
thinking
it
savoured
not
a
little
of
arrogance
and
still
more
of
ignorance
in
the
fair
writer
who
being
a
woman
of
talent
should
have
known
better
a
child
is
not
a
man
but
his
progress
is
regarded
with
more
attention
on
that
account
and
his
future
greatness
is
very
much
determined
by
the
progress
he
makes
in
his
youth
to
judge
canada
by
the
same
standard
she
appears
to
be
a
giant
for
her
years
and
well
worthy
the
most
serious
contemplation
many
are
the
weary
overtasked
minds
in
that
great
wealthy
and
powerful
england
that
turn
towards
this
flourishing
colony
their
anxious
thoughts
and
would
willingly
exchange
the
golden
prime
of
the
mother
country
for
the
healthy
vigorous
young
strength
of
this
her
stalwart
child
and
consider
themselves
only
too
happy
in
securing
a
home
upon
these
free
and
fertile
shores
be
not
discouraged
brave
emigrant
let
canada
still
remain
the
bright
future
in
your
mind
and
hasten
to
convert
your
present
into
reality
the
time
is
not
far
distant
when
she
shall
be
the
theme
of
many
tongues
and
the
old
nations
of
the
world
will
speak
of
her
progress
with
respect
and
admiration
her
infancy
is
past
she
begins
to
feel
her
feet
to
know
her
own
strength
and
see
her
way
clearly
through
the
wilderness
child
as
you
may
deem
her
she
has
already
battled
bravely
for
her
own
rights
and
obtained
the
management
of
her
own
affairs
her
onward
progress
is
certain
there
is
no
in
her
case
she
possesses
within
her
own
territory
all
the
elements
of
future
prosperity
and
must
be
great
the
men
who
throng
her
marts
and
clear
her
forests
are
not
who
have
already
realized
solomon
pithy
proverb
in
all
labour
is
profit
and
their
industry
has
imbued
them
with
a
spirit
of
independence
which
can
not
fail
to
make
them
a
free
and
enlightened
people
an
illustration
of
the
truth
of
what
i
advance
can
be
given
in
the
pretty
town
we
are
leaving
on
the
north
side
of
the
bay
i
think
you
will
own
with
me
that
your
eyes
have
seldom
rested
upon
a
spot
more
favoured
by
nature
or
one
that
bids
fairer
to
rise
to
great
wealth
and
political
importance
sixty
years
ago
the
spot
that
belleville
now
occupies
was
in
the
wilderness
and
its
rapid
sparkling
river
and
sunny
upland
slopes
which
during
the
lapse
of
ages
have
formed
a
succession
of
banks
to
the
said
river
were
only
known
to
the
indian
hunter
and
the
white
trader
where
you
see
those
substantial
stone
wharfs
and
the
masts
of
those
vessels
unloading
their
valuable
cargoes
to
replenish
the
stores
of
the
wealthy
merchants
in
the
town
a
tangled
cedar
swamp
spread
its
dark
unwholesome
vegetation
into
the
bay
completely
covering
with
an
impenetrable
jungle
those
smooth
verdant
plains
now
surrounded
with
neat
cottages
and
gardens
of
a
bright
summer
evening
and
when
is
a
canadian
summer
evening
otherwise
those
plains
swarm
with
happy
healthy
children
who
assemble
there
to
pursue
their
gambols
beyond
the
heat
and
dust
of
the
town
or
to
watch
with
eager
eyes
the
young
men
of
the
place
engaged
in
the
manly
old
english
game
of
cricket
with
whom
it
is
in
their
harmless
boasting
belleville
against
kingston
the
whole
world
the
editor
of
a
kingston
paper
once
had
the
barbarity
to
compare
these
valiant
champions
of
the
bat
and
ball
to
singed
cats
ugly
to
look
at
but
very
devils
to
go
our
lads
have
never
forgiven
the
insult
and
should
the
said
editor
ever
show
his
face
upon
their
ground
they
would
kick
him
off
with
as
little
ceremony
as
they
would
a
spent
ball
on
that
high
sandy
ridge
that
overlooks
the
town
eastward
where
the
tin
roof
of
the
court
house
a
massy
but
rather
tasteless
building
and
the
spires
of
four
churches
catch
the
rays
of
the
sun
a
tangled
maze
of
hazel
bushes
and
wild
plum
and
cherry
once
screened
the
indian
and
the
children
of
the
red
hunter
sought
for
strawberries
among
the
long
grass
and
wild
flowers
that
flourish
profusely
in
that
sandy
soil
would
that
you
could
stand
with
me
on
that
lofty
eminence
and
look
around
you
the
charming
prospect
that
spreads
itself
at
your
feet
would
richly
repay
you
for
toiling
up
the
hill
we
will
suppose
ourselves
standing
among
the
graves
in
the
of
the
english
church
the
sunny
heavens
above
us
the
glorious
waters
of
the
bay
clasping
in
their
azure
belt
of
the
landscape
and
the
quiet
dead
sleeping
at
our
feet
the
white
man
has
so
completely
supplanted
his
red
brother
that
he
has
appropriated
the
very
spot
that
held
his
bones
and
in
a
few
years
their
dust
will
mingle
together
although
no
stone
marks
the
grave
where
the
red
man
sleeps
from
this
churchyard
you
enjoy
the
finest
view
of
the
town
and
surrounding
country
and
turn
your
eyes
which
way
you
will
they
can
not
fail
to
rest
on
some
natural
object
of
great
interest
and
beauty
the
church
itself
is
but
a
homely
structure
and
has
always
been
to
me
a
great
eyesore
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
the
first
inhabitants
of
the
place
selected
their
best
and
most
healthy
building
sites
for
the
erection
of
places
of
worship
churches
and
churchyards
occupy
the
hills
from
whence
they
obtain
their
springs
of
fresh
water
and
such
delicious
water
they
do
not
at
present
feel
any
arising
from
this
error
of
judgment
but
the
time
will
come
as
population
increases
and
the
dead
accumulate
when
these
by
poisoning
the
springs
that
flow
through
them
will
materially
injure
the
health
of
the
living
the
english
church
was
built
many
years
ago
partly
of
red
brick
burnt
in
the
neighbourhood
and
partly
of
wood
coloured
red
to
make
up
the
deficiency
of
the
costlier
material
this
seems
a
shabby
saving
as
abundance
of
of
the
best
quality
abounds
in
the
same
hill
and
the
making
of
bricks
forms
a
very
lucrative
and
important
craft
to
several
persons
in
the
town
belleville
was
but
a
small
settlement
on
the
edge
of
the
forest
scarcely
deserving
the
name
of
a
village
when
this
church
first
pointed
its
ugly
tower
towards
heaven
doubtless
its
founders
thought
they
had
done
wonders
when
they
erected
this
humble
looking
place
of
worship
but
now
when
their
descendants
have
become
rich
and
the
village
of
and
frame
buildings
has
grown
into
a
populous
busy
thriving
town
and
this
red
tasteless
building
is
too
small
to
accommodate
its
congregation
it
should
no
longer
hold
the
height
of
the
hill
but
give
place
to
a
larger
and
handsomer
edifice
behold
its
catholic
brother
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
how
much
its
elegant
structure
and
graceful
spire
adds
to
the
beauty
of
the
scene
yet
the
funds
for
rearing
that
handsome
building
which
is
such
an
ornament
to
the
town
were
chiefly
derived
from
small
subscriptions
drawn
from
the
earnings
of
mechanics
and
female
servants
if
the
church
of
england
were
supported
throughout
the
colony
on
the
voluntary
principle
we
should
soon
see
fine
stone
churches
like
michael
replacing
these
decaying
edifices
of
wood
and
the
outcry
about
the
question
of
the
clergy
reserves
would
be
merged
in
her
increased
influence
and
prosperity
the
sonorous
bell
that
fills
the
steeple
of
the
catholic
church
which
cost
i
have
been
told
seven
hundred
pounds
and
was
brought
all
the
way
from
spain
was
purchased
by
the
voluntary
donations
of
the
congregation
this
bell
is
remarkable
for
its
fine
tone
which
can
be
heard
eight
miles
into
the
country
and
as
far
as
the
village
of
northport
eleven
miles
distant
on
the
other
side
of
the
bay
there
is
a
solemn
grandeur
in
the
solitary
voice
of
the
magnificent
bell
as
it
booms
across
the
valley
in
which
the
town
lies
and
reverberates
among
the
distant
woods
and
hills
which
has
a
very
imposing
effect
a
few
years
ago
the
mechanics
in
the
town
entered
into
an
agreement
that
they
would
only
work
from
six
to
six
during
the
summer
months
and
from
seven
till
five
in
the
winter
and
they
offered
to
pay
a
certain
sum
to
the
catholic
church
for
tolling
the
bell
at
the
said
hours
the
catholic
workmen
who
reside
in
or
near
the
town
adhere
strictly
to
this
rule
and
if
the
season
is
ever
so
pressing
they
obstinately
refuse
to
work
before
or
after
the
stated
time
i
have
seen
on
our
own
little
farm
the
mower
fling
down
his
scythe
in
the
swathe
and
the
his
sickle
in
the
ridge
the
moment
the
bell
tolled
for
six
in
fact
the
bell
in
this
respect
is
looked
upon
as
a
great
nuisance
and
the
farmers
in
the
country
refuse
to
be
guided
by
it
in
the
hours
allotted
for
field
labour
as
they
justly
remark
that
the
best
time
for
hard
work
in
a
hot
country
is
before
six
in
the
morning
and
after
the
heat
of
the
day
in
the
evening
when
the
bell
commences
to
toll
there
is
a
long
pause
between
each
of
the
first
four
strokes
this
is
to
allow
the
pious
catholic
time
for
crossing
himself
and
saying
a
short
prayer
how
much
of
the
ideal
mingles
with
this
worship
no
wonder
that
the
irish
who
are
such
an
imaginative
people
should
cling
to
it
with
such
veneration
would
any
other
creed
suit
them
as
well
it
is
a
solemn
thing
to
step
into
their
churches
and
witness
the
intensity
of
their
devotions
reason
never
raises
a
doubt
to
shake
the
oneness
of
their
faith
they
receive
it
on
the
credit
of
their
priests
and
their
credulity
is
as
boundless
as
their
ignorance
often
have
i
asked
the
poor
catholics
in
my
employ
why
such
and
such
days
were
holy
days
they
could
seldom
tell
me
but
said
that
the
priest
told
them
to
keep
them
holy
and
to
break
them
would
be
a
deadly
sin
i
can
not
but
respect
their
trust
and
the
reverence
they
feel
for
their
spiritual
teachers
nor
could
i
ever
bring
myself
to
believe
that
a
conscientious
catholic
was
in
any
danger
of
rejection
from
the
final
bar
he
has
imposed
upon
himself
a
heavier
yoke
than
the
saviour
kindly
laid
upon
him
and
has
enslaved
himself
with
a
thousand
superstitious
observances
which
to
us
appear
absurd
but
his
sincerity
should
awaken
in
us
an
affectionate
interest
in
his
behalf
not
engender
the
bitter
hatred
which
at
present
forms
an
adamantine
barrier
between
us
if
the
protestant
would
give
up
a
little
of
his
bigotry
and
the
catholic
a
part
of
his
superstition
and
they
would
consent
to
meet
each
other
half
way
as
brothers
of
one
common
manhood
inspired
by
the
same
christian
hope
and
bound
to
the
same
heavenly
country
we
should
no
longer
see
the
orange
banner
flaunting
our
streets
on
the
twelfth
of
july
and
natives
of
the
same
island
provoking
each
other
to
acts
of
violence
and
bloodshed
these
hostile
encounters
are
of
yearly
occurrence
in
the
colony
and
are
justly
held
in
abhorrence
by
the
pious
and
thinking
portion
of
the
population
of
either
denomination
the
government
has
for
many
years
vainly
endeavoured
to
put
them
down
but
they
still
pollute
with
their
moral
leprosy
the
free
institutions
of
the
country
and
effectually
prevent
any
friendly
feeling
which
might
grow
up
between
the
members
of
these
rival
and
hostile
creeds
in
canada
where
all
religions
are
tolerated
it
appears
a
useless
aggravation
of
an
old
national
grievance
to
perpetuate
the
memory
of
the
battle
of
the
boyne
what
have
we
to
do
with
the
hatreds
and
animosities
of
a
more
barbarous
age
these
things
belong
to
the
past
let
the
dead
bury
their
dead
and
let
us
form
for
ourselves
a
holier
and
truer
present
the
old
quarrel
between
irish
catholics
and
protestants
should
have
been
sunk
in
the
ocean
when
they
left
their
native
country
to
find
a
home
unpolluted
by
the
tyrannies
of
bygone
ages
in
the
wilds
of
canada
the
larger
portion
of
our
domestics
are
from
ireland
and
as
far
as
my
experience
goes
i
have
found
the
catholic
irish
as
faithful
and
trustworthy
as
the
protestants
the
tendency
to
hate
belongs
to
the
race
not
to
the
religion
or
the
protestant
would
not
exhibit
the
same
vindictive
spirit
which
marks
his
catholic
brother
they
break
and
destroy
more
than
the
protestants
but
that
springs
from
the
reckless
carelessness
of
their
character
more
than
from
any
malice
against
their
employers
if
you
may
judge
by
the
bad
usage
they
give
their
own
household
goods
and
tools
the
principle
on
which
they
live
is
literally
to
care
as
little
as
possible
for
the
things
of
and
to
take
no
thought
at
all
for
the
morrow
shure
it
can
be
used
said
an
irish
girl
to
me
after
breaking
the
spout
out
of
an
expensive
china
jug
it
is
not
a
hair
the
worse
she
could
not
imagine
that
a
mutilated
object
could
occasion
the
least
discomfort
to
those
accustomed
to
order
and
neatness
in
their
household
arrangements
the
irish
female
servants
are
remarkably
chaste
in
their
language
and
deportment
you
are
often
obliged
to
find
fault
with
them
for
gross
acts
of
neglect
and
wastefulness
but
never
for
using
bad
language
they
may
spoil
your
children
by
but
they
never
corrupt
their
morals
by
loose
conversation
an
irish
girl
once
told
me
with
beautiful
simplicity
that
every
bad
word
a
woman
uttered
made
the
blessed
virgin
a
girl
becoming
a
mother
before
marriage
is
regarded
as
a
dreadful
calamity
by
her
family
and
she
seldom
if
ever
gets
one
of
her
own
countrymen
to
marry
her
with
this
stain
on
her
character
how
different
is
the
conduct
of
the
female
peasantry
in
the
eastern
counties
of
england
who
unblushingly
avow
their
derelictions
from
the
paths
of
virtue
the
crime
of
infanticide
so
common
there
is
almost
unknown
among
the
irish
if
the
priest
and
the
confessional
are
able
to
restrain
the
lower
orders
from
the
commission
of
gross
crime
who
shall
say
that
they
are
without
their
use
it
is
true
that
the
priest
often
exercises
his
power
over
his
flock
in
a
manner
which
would
appear
to
a
protestant
to
border
on
the
ludicrous
a
girl
who
lived
with
a
lady
of
my
acquaintance
gave
the
following
graphic
account
of
an
exhortation
delivered
by
the
priest
at
the
altar
i
give
it
in
her
own
words
shure
we
got
a
great
scould
from
the
praste
the
day
indeed
biddy
what
did
he
scold
you
for
faix
and
it
not
meself
that
he
scoulded
at
all
at
all
but
misther
peter
n
and
john
l
an
he
held
them
up
as
an
example
to
the
whole
church
n
says
he
have
not
been
inside
this
church
before
for
the
last
three
months
and
you
have
not
paid
your
for
the
last
two
years
but
maybe
you
have
got
the
fourteen
dollars
in
your
pocket
at
this
moment
of
spaking
or
maybe
you
have
spint
it
in
buying
to
make
gridirons
in
order
to
fry
your
mate
of
a
friday
and
when
your
praste
comes
to
visit
you
if
he
does
not
see
it
itself
he
smells
it
and
you
john
l
alderman
l
are
not
six
days
enough
in
the
week
for
work
and
pastime
that
you
must
go
hunting
of
hares
on
a
holiday
and
pray
how
many
hares
did
you
catch
alderman
john
the
point
of
the
last
satire
lay
in
the
fact
that
the
said
alderman
john
was
known
to
be
an
ambitious
but
very
poor
sportsman
which
made
the
allusion
to
the
he
had
shot
the
unkindest
cut
of
all
such
an
oration
from
a
protestant
minister
would
have
led
his
congregation
to
imagine
that
their
good
pastor
had
lost
his
wits
but
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
was
eminently
successful
in
abstracting
the
fourteen
dollars
from
the
pocket
of
the
dilatory
peter
n
and
in
preventing
alderman
john
from
hunting
hares
on
a
holiday
for
the
time
to
come
most
of
the
irish
priests
possess
a
great
deal
of
humour
which
always
finds
a
response
in
their
countrymen
to
whom
wit
is
a
quality
of
native
growth
i
wish
you
a
happy
death
pat
s
said
r
the
jolly
priest
of
p
after
he
had
married
an
old
servant
of
ours
who
had
reached
the
patriarchal
age
of
to
an
old
woman
of
seventy
d
clear
of
it
quoth
pat
smiting
his
thigh
with
a
look
of
inimitable
drollery
such
a
look
of
broad
humour
as
can
alone
twinkle
from
the
eyes
of
an
emeralder
of
that
class
pat
was
a
prophet
in
less
than
six
months
he
brought
the
body
of
the
youthful
bride
in
a
waggon
to
the
house
of
the
said
priest
to
be
buried
and
for
aught
i
know
to
the
contrary
the
old
man
is
living
still
and
very
likely
to
treat
himself
to
a
third
wife
i
was
told
two
amusing
anecdotes
of
the
late
bishop
macdonald
a
man
whose
memory
is
held
in
great
veneration
in
the
province
which
i
will
give
you
here
the
old
bishop
was
crossing
the
rice
lake
in
a
birch
bark
canoe
in
company
with
r
the
presbyterian
minister
of
peterboro
the
day
was
rather
stormy
and
the
water
rough
for
such
a
fragile
conveyance
the
bishop
who
had
been
many
years
in
the
country
knew
there
was
little
danger
to
be
apprehended
if
they
sat
still
and
he
had
perfect
reliance
in
the
skill
of
their
indian
boatman
not
so
r
he
had
only
been
a
few
months
in
the
colony
and
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
ventured
upon
the
water
in
such
a
tottleish
machine
instead
of
remaining
quietly
seated
in
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
he
endeavoured
to
start
to
his
feet
which
would
inevitably
have
upset
it
this
rash
movement
was
prevented
by
the
bishop
who
forcibly
pulled
him
down
into
a
sitting
posture
exclaiming
as
he
did
so
keep
still
my
good
sir
if
you
by
your
groundless
fears
upset
the
canoe
your
protestant
friends
will
swear
that
the
old
papist
drowned
the
presbyterian
one
hot
sultry
july
evening
the
celebrated
dunlop
called
to
have
a
chat
with
the
bishop
who
knowing
the
doctor
weak
point
his
fondness
for
strong
drinks
and
his
almost
rabid
antipathy
to
water
asked
him
if
he
would
take
a
draught
of
edinburgh
ale
as
he
had
just
received
a
cask
in
a
present
from
the
old
country
the
doctor
thirst
grew
to
a
perfect
drought
and
he
exclaimed
that
nothing
at
that
moment
could
afford
him
greater
pleasure
the
bell
was
rung
the
spruce
neat
servant
girl
appeared
and
was
forthwith
commissioned
to
take
the
bishop
own
silver
tankard
and
draw
the
thirsty
doctor
a
pint
of
ale
the
girl
quickly
returned
the
impatient
doctor
grasped
the
nectarian
draught
and
without
glancing
into
the
tankard
for
the
time
was
that
soft
hour
summer
eve
and
close
emptied
the
greater
part
of
its
contents
down
his
throat
a
spasmodic
contortion
and
a
sudden
rush
to
the
open
window
surprised
the
hospitable
bishop
who
had
anticipated
a
great
treat
for
his
guest
my
dear
sir
he
cried
what
can
be
the
matter
oh
that
diabolical
stuff
groaned
the
doctor
i
am
poisoned
oh
never
fear
said
the
bishop
examining
the
liquid
that
still
remained
in
the
tankard
and
bursting
into
a
hearty
laugh
it
may
not
agree
with
a
protestant
stomach
but
believe
me
dear
doctor
you
never
took
such
a
wholesome
drink
in
your
life
before
i
was
lately
sent
from
rome
a
cask
of
holy
water
it
stands
in
the
same
cellar
with
the
ale
i
put
a
little
salt
into
it
in
order
to
preserve
it
during
this
hot
weather
and
the
girl
by
mistake
has
given
you
the
consecrated
water
instead
of
the
ale
oh
curse
her
cried
the
tortured
doctor
i
wish
it
was
in
her
stomach
instead
of
mine
the
bishop
used
to
tell
this
story
with
great
glee
whenever
dunlop
and
his
eccentric
habits
formed
the
theme
of
conversation
that
the
catholics
do
not
always
act
with
hostility
towards
their
protestant
brethren
the
following
anecdote
which
it
gives
me
great
pleasure
to
relate
will
sufficiently
show
in
the
december
of
we
had
the
misfortune
to
be
burnt
out
and
lost
a
great
part
of
our
furniture
clothing
and
winter
stores
poor
as
we
were
this
could
not
be
regarded
in
any
other
light
but
as
a
great
calamity
during
the
confusion
occasioned
by
the
fire
and
owing
to
the
negligence
of
a
servant
to
whose
care
he
was
especially
confided
my
youngest
child
a
fine
boy
of
two
years
old
was
for
some
time
missing
the
agony
i
endured
for
about
half
an
hour
i
shall
never
forget
the
roaring
flames
the
impending
misfortune
that
hung
over
us
was
forgotten
in
the
terror
that
shook
my
mind
lest
he
had
become
a
victim
to
the
flames
he
was
at
length
found
by
a
kind
neighbour
in
the
kitchen
of
the
burning
building
whither
he
had
crept
from
among
the
crowd
and
was
scarcely
rescued
before
the
roof
fell
in
this
circumstance
shook
my
nerves
so
completely
that
i
gladly
accepted
the
offer
of
a
female
friend
to
leave
the
exciting
scene
and
make
her
house
my
home
until
we
could
procure
another
i
was
sitting
at
her
parlour
window
with
the
rescued
child
on
my
lap
whom
i
could
not
bear
for
a
moment
out
of
my
sight
watching
the
smoking
brands
that
had
once
composed
my
home
and
sadly
pondering
over
our
untoward
destiny
when
servant
told
me
that
a
gentleman
wanted
to
see
me
in
the
with
little
johnnie
still
in
my
arms
i
went
to
receive
the
visitor
and
found
the
rev
father
b
the
worthy
catholic
priest
waiting
to
receive
me
at
that
time
i
knew
very
little
of
father
b
calls
had
been
exchanged
and
we
had
been
much
pleased
with
his
courteous
manners
and
racy
irish
wit
i
shall
never
forget
the
kind
earnest
manner
in
which
he
condoled
with
me
on
our
present
misfortune
he
did
not
however
confine
his
sympathy
to
words
but
offered
me
the
use
of
his
neat
cottage
until
we
could
provide
ourselves
with
another
house
you
know
he
said
with
a
benevolent
smile
i
have
no
family
to
be
disturbed
by
the
noise
of
the
children
and
if
you
will
accept
the
temporary
home
i
offer
you
it
is
entirely
at
your
service
and
he
continued
lowering
his
voice
if
the
sheriff
is
in
want
of
money
to
procure
necessaries
for
his
family
i
can
supply
him
until
such
time
as
he
is
able
to
repay
me
this
was
truly
noble
and
i
thanked
him
with
tears
in
my
eyes
we
did
not
accept
the
generous
offer
of
this
good
samaritan
but
we
have
always
felt
a
grateful
remembrance
of
his
kindness
b
had
been
one
of
the
most
active
among
the
many
gentlemen
who
did
their
best
in
trying
to
save
our
property
from
the
flames
a
great
portion
of
which
was
safely
conveyed
to
the
street
but
here
a
system
of
pillage
was
carried
on
by
the
heartless
beings
who
regard
fires
and
wreck
as
their
especial
harvest
which
entirely
frustrated
the
efforts
of
the
generous
and
brave
men
who
had
done
so
much
to
help
us
how
many
odd
things
happen
during
a
fire
which
would
call
up
a
hearty
laugh
upon
a
less
serious
occasion
i
saw
one
man
pitch
a
handsome
out
of
an
upper
window
into
the
street
in
order
to
it
while
another
at
the
risk
of
his
life
carried
a
bottomless
china
jug
which
had
long
been
useless
down
the
burning
staircase
and
seemed
quite
elated
with
his
success
and
a
carpenter
took
off
the
doors
and
removed
the
in
order
to
preserve
them
and
by
sending
a
rush
of
air
through
the
burning
edifice
accelerated
its
destruction
at
that
time
there
was
only
one
fire
engine
in
the
town
and
that
was
not
in
a
state
to
work
now
they
have
two
excellent
engines
worked
by
an
active
and
energetic
body
of
men
in
all
the
principal
towns
and
cities
in
the
colony
a
large
portion
of
the
younger
male
inhabitants
enrol
themselves
into
a
company
for
the
suppression
of
fire
it
is
a
voluntary
service
from
which
they
receive
no
emolument
without
an
exemption
from
filling
the
office
of
a
juryman
may
be
considered
as
an
advantage
these
men
act
upon
a
principle
of
mutual
safety
and
the
exertions
which
are
made
by
them
in
the
hour
of
danger
are
truly
wonderful
and
serve
to
show
what
can
be
effected
by
men
when
they
work
in
unison
together
to
the
canadian
the
public
is
indebted
for
the
preservation
of
life
and
property
by
a
thousand
heroic
acts
deeds
that
would
be
recorded
as
surprising
efforts
of
human
courage
if
performed
upon
the
battlefield
and
which
often
exhibit
an
exalted
benevolence
when
exercised
in
rescuing
helpless
women
and
children
from
such
a
dreadful
enemy
as
fire
the
costume
adopted
by
the
firemen
is
rather
becoming
than
otherwise
a
of
coarse
red
cloth
and
white
trousers
in
summer
which
latter
portion
of
their
dress
is
exchanged
for
dark
blue
in
the
winter
they
wear
a
glazed
black
leather
cap
of
a
military
cut
when
they
assemble
to
work
their
engines
or
walk
in
procession
and
a
leather
hat
like
a
sailor
with
a
long
peak
behind
to
protect
them
from
injury
when
on
active
duty
their
members
are
confined
to
no
particular
class
gentlemen
and
mechanics
work
side
by
side
in
this
fraternity
with
a
zeal
and
right
good
will
that
is
truly
edifying
their
system
appears
an
excellent
one
and
i
never
heard
of
any
dissension
among
their
ranks
when
their
services
were
required
the
sound
of
the
ominous
bell
calls
them
to
the
spot
from
the
greatest
distance
and
during
the
most
stormy
nights
whoever
skulks
in
bed
the
fireman
is
sure
to
be
at
his
post
once
a
year
the
different
divisions
of
the
company
walk
in
procession
through
the
town
on
this
occasion
their
engines
are
dressed
up
with
flags
bearing
appropriate
mottoes
and
they
are
preceded
by
a
band
of
music
the
companies
are
generally
composed
of
men
in
the
very
prime
of
life
and
they
make
a
very
imposing
appearance
it
is
always
a
great
gala
day
in
the
town
and
terminates
with
a
public
dinner
that
is
followed
by
a
ball
in
the
evening
at
which
the
wives
and
daughters
of
the
members
of
the
company
are
expected
to
appear
once
a
month
the
firemen
are
called
out
to
practise
with
the
engine
in
the
streets
to
the
infinite
delight
of
all
the
boys
in
the
neighbourhood
who
follow
the
engine
in
crowds
and
provoke
the
operators
to
turn
the
hose
and
play
upon
their
merry
ranks
and
then
what
laughing
and
shouting
and
scampering
in
all
directions
as
the
ragged
urchins
shake
their
dripping
garments
and
fly
from
the
ducking
they
had
courted
a
few
minutes
before
the
number
of
wooden
buildings
that
compose
the
larger
portion
of
canadian
towns
renders
fire
a
calamity
of
very
frequent
occurrence
and
persons
can
not
be
too
particular
in
regard
to
it
the
negligence
of
one
ignorant
servant
in
the
disposal
of
her
ashes
may
involve
the
safety
of
the
whole
community
as
long
as
the
generality
of
the
houses
are
roofed
with
shingles
this
liability
to
fire
must
exist
as
a
necessary
consequence
the
shingle
is
a
very
thin
which
is
used
throughout
the
colony
instead
of
slate
or
tiles
after
a
few
years
the
heat
and
rain
roughen
the
outward
surface
and
give
it
a
woolly
appearance
rendering
the
shingles
as
inflammable
as
tinder
a
spark
from
a
chimney
may
be
conveyed
from
a
great
distance
on
a
windy
day
and
lighting
upon
the
furry
surface
of
these
roofs
is
sure
to
ignite
the
danger
spreads
on
all
sides
and
the
roofs
of
a
whole
street
will
be
burning
before
the
fire
communicates
to
the
walls
of
the
buildings
so
many
destructive
fires
have
occurred
of
late
years
throughout
the
colony
that
a
law
has
been
enacted
by
the
municipal
councils
to
prevent
the
erection
of
wooden
buildings
in
the
large
cities
but
without
the
additional
precaution
of
roofs
the
prohibition
will
not
produce
very
beneficial
effects
two
other
very
pretty
churches
occupy
the
same
hill
with
the
catholics
and
episcopal
the
scotch
residuary
and
the
free
church
the
latter
is
built
of
dark
limestone
quarried
in
the
neighbourhood
and
is
a
remarkably
graceful
structure
it
has
been
raised
by
the
hearty
goodwill
and
free
donations
of
its
congregation
and
affords
another
capital
illustration
of
the
working
of
the
voluntary
principle
to
the
doctrines
of
john
calvin
i
am
myself
no
convert
nor
do
i
think
that
the
churches
established
on
his
views
will
very
long
exist
in
the
world
stern
uncompromising
unloveable
and
unloved
an
object
of
fear
rather
than
of
affection
john
calvin
stands
out
the
incarnation
of
his
own
deity
verifying
one
of
the
noblest
and
truest
sentences
ever
penned
by
man
as
the
man
so
his
god
god
is
his
idea
of
excellence
the
compliment
of
his
own
being
the
residuary
church
is
a
small
neat
building
of
wood
painted
white
for
several
years
after
the
great
split
in
the
national
church
of
scotland
it
was
shut
up
the
few
who
still
adhered
to
the
old
way
being
unable
to
contribute
much
to
the
support
of
a
minister
the
church
has
been
reopened
within
the
last
two
years
and
though
the
congregation
is
very
small
has
a
regular
pastor
the
large
edifice
beneath
us
in
pinacle
street
leading
to
the
bay
is
the
wesleyan
methodist
church
or
chapel
as
it
would
be
termed
at
home
thanks
to
the
liberal
institutions
of
the
country
such
distinctions
are
unknown
in
canada
every
community
of
christian
worshippers
is
rightly
termed
a
church
the
church
is
only
arrogated
by
one
the
wesleyans
who
have
been
of
infinite
use
in
spreading
the
gospel
on
the
north
american
continent
possess
a
numerous
and
highly
respectable
congregation
in
this
place
their
church
is
always
supplied
with
good
and
efficient
preachers
and
is
filled
on
the
sabbath
to
overflowing
they
have
a
very
fine
choir
and
lately
purchased
an
organ
which
was
constructed
by
one
of
their
own
members
a
genius
in
his
way
for
which
they
gave
the
handsome
sum
of
a
thousand
dollars
there
is
also
an
episcopal
methodist
church
composed
of
red
brick
at
the
upper
end
of
the
town
by
the
river
side
which
is
well
attended
you
can
scarcely
adopt
a
better
plan
of
judging
of
the
wealth
and
prosperity
of
a
town
than
by
watching
of
a
sabbath
morning
the
congregations
of
the
different
denominations
going
to
church
belleville
weekly
presents
to
the
eye
of
an
observing
spectator
a
large
body
of
people
robust
healthy
men
and
handsome
women
an
air
of
content
and
comfort
resting
upon
their
comely
faces
no
look
of
haggard
care
and
pinching
want
marring
the
quiet
solemnity
of
the
scene
the
dress
of
the
higher
class
is
not
only
cut
in
the
newest
french
fashion
imported
from
new
york
but
is
generally
composed
of
rich
and
expensive
materials
the
canadian
lady
dresses
well
and
tastefully
and
carries
herself
easily
and
gracefully
she
is
not
unconscious
of
the
advantages
of
a
pretty
face
and
figure
but
her
knowledge
of
the
fact
is
not
exhibited
in
an
affected
or
disagreeable
manner
the
lower
class
are
not
a
whit
behind
their
wealthier
neighbours
in
outward
adornments
and
the
poor
emigrant
who
only
a
few
months
previously
had
landed
in
rags
is
now
dressed
neatly
and
respectably
the
consciousness
of
their
freedom
has
raised
them
in
the
scale
of
society
in
their
own
estimation
and
in
that
of
their
fellows
they
feel
that
they
are
no
longer
despised
the
ample
wages
they
receive
has
enabled
them
to
cast
off
the
slough
of
hopeless
poverty
which
once
threw
its
deadening
influence
over
them
repressing
all
their
energies
and
destroying
that
which
is
so
necessary
to
mental
improvement
and
the
change
in
their
condition
is
apparent
in
their
smiling
satisfied
faces
this
is
indeed
a
delightful
contrast
to
the
squalid
want
and
poverty
which
so
often
meet
the
eye
and
pain
the
heart
of
the
philanthropist
at
home
canada
is
blessed
in
the
almost
total
absence
of
pauperism
for
none
but
the
wilfully
idle
and
vicious
need
starve
here
while
the
wants
of
the
sick
and
infirm
meet
with
ready
help
and
sympathy
from
a
most
charitable
public
the
wesleyan
methodists
wisely
placed
their
at
some
distance
from
the
town
and
when
we
first
came
to
reside
at
belleville
it
was
a
retired
and
lovely
spot
on
the
kingston
road
commanding
a
fine
view
of
the
bay
the
rapid
spread
of
the
village
into
a
town
almost
embraces
in
its
arms
this
once
solitary
spot
and
in
a
few
years
it
will
be
surrounded
with
suburban
residences
there
is
a
very
large
brick
field
adjoining
this
cemetery
which
employs
during
the
summer
months
a
number
of
hands
turn
to
the
north
and
observe
that
house
now
tottering
to
decay
that
crowns
the
precipitous
ridge
that
overlooks
the
river
and
which
doubtless
at
some
very
distant
period
once
formed
its
right
bank
that
house
was
built
by
one
of
the
first
settlers
in
belleville
an
officer
who
drew
his
lot
of
wild
land
on
that
spot
it
was
a
great
house
in
those
days
and
he
was
a
great
man
in
the
eyes
of
his
poorer
neighbours
this
gentleman
impoverished
himself
and
his
family
by
supplying
from
his
own
means
the
wants
of
the
poor
emigrants
in
his
vicinity
during
the
great
canadian
famine
which
happened
about
fifty
years
ago
the
starving
creatures
promised
to
repay
him
at
some
future
period
plenty
again
blessed
the
land
but
the
generous
philanthropist
was
forgotten
by
those
his
bounty
had
saved
peace
to
his
memory
though
unrewarded
on
earth
he
has
doubtless
reaped
his
reward
in
heaven
the
river
moira
which
runs
parallel
with
the
main
street
of
the
town
and
traverses
several
fine
townships
belonging
to
the
county
of
hastings
in
its
course
to
the
bay
is
a
rapid
and
very
picturesque
stream
its
rocky
banks
which
are
composed
of
limestone
are
fringed
with
the
graceful
cedar
soft
maple
and
elegant
rock
elm
that
queen
of
the
canadian
forest
it
is
not
navigable
but
is
one
great
source
of
the
wealth
and
prosperity
of
the
place
affording
all
along
its
course
excellent
sites
for
mills
distilleries
and
factories
while
it
is
the
main
road
down
which
millions
of
feet
of
timber
are
yearly
floated
to
be
rafted
at
the
entrance
of
the
bay
the
spring
floods
bring
down
such
a
vast
amount
of
lumber
that
often
a
jam
as
it
is
technically
called
places
the
two
bridges
that
span
the
river
in
a
state
of
blockade
it
is
a
stirring
and
amusing
scene
to
watch
the
french
canadian
lumberers
with
their
long
poles
armed
at
the
end
with
sharp
spikes
leaping
from
log
to
log
and
freeing
a
passage
for
the
crowded
timbers
handsome
in
person
and
lithe
and
active
as
wild
cats
you
would
imagine
to
watch
their
careless
disregard
of
danger
that
they
were
born
of
the
waters
and
considered
death
by
drowning
an
impossible
casualty
in
their
case
yet
never
a
season
passes
without
fatal
accidents
thinning
their
gay
ranks
these
amphibious
creatures
spend
half
their
lives
in
and
on
the
waters
they
work
hard
in
forming
rafts
at
the
entrance
of
the
bay
during
the
day
and
in
the
evening
they
repair
to
some
favourite
tavern
where
they
spend
the
greater
part
of
the
night
in
singing
and
dancing
their
peculiar
cries
awaken
you
by
and
their
joyous
shouts
and
songs
are
wafted
on
the
evening
breeze
their
picturesque
dress
and
shanties
when
shown
by
their
red
along
the
rocky
banks
of
the
river
at
night
add
great
liveliness
and
give
a
peculiarly
romantic
character
to
the
water
scene
they
appear
a
happy
harmless
set
of
men
brave
and
independent
and
if
drinking
and
swearing
are
vices
common
to
their
caste
and
occupation
it
can
scarcely
be
wondered
at
in
the
wild
reckless
roving
life
they
lead
they
never
trouble
the
peaceful
inhabitants
of
the
town
their
broils
are
chiefly
confined
to
their
irish
comrades
and
seldom
go
beyond
the
scene
of
their
mutual
labour
it
is
not
often
that
they
find
their
way
into
the
jail
or
penitentiary
a
young
lady
told
me
an
adventure
that
befell
her
and
her
sister
which
is
rather
a
droll
illustration
of
the
manners
of
a
french
canadian
lumberer
they
were
walking
one
fine
summer
evening
along
the
west
bank
of
the
moira
and
the
narrator
in
stooping
over
the
water
to
gather
some
that
grew
in
a
crevice
of
the
rocks
dropped
her
parasol
into
the
river
a
cry
of
vexation
at
the
loss
of
an
article
of
dress
which
is
expensive
and
almost
indispensable
beneath
the
rays
of
a
canadian
summer
sun
burst
from
her
lips
and
attracted
the
attention
of
a
young
man
whom
she
had
not
before
observed
who
was
swimming
at
some
distance
down
the
river
he
immediately
turned
and
dexterously
catching
the
parasol
as
it
swiftly
glided
past
him
swam
towards
the
ladies
with
the
rescued
article
carried
between
his
teeth
in
his
zeal
to
render
this
little
service
the
poor
fellow
forgot
that
he
was
not
in
a
condition
to
appear
before
ladies
who
startled
at
such
an
extraordinary
apparition
made
the
best
of
their
heels
to
fly
precipitately
from
the
spot
i
have
no
doubt
said
miss
laughing
that
the
fellow
meant
well
but
i
never
was
so
frightened
and
confounded
in
my
life
the
next
morning
the
parasol
was
returned
at
the
street
door
with
jean
baptiste
compliments
to
the
young
ladies
so
much
for
french
canadian
gallantry
it
is
a
pretty
sight
a
large
raft
of
timber
extending
perhaps
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
gliding
down
the
bay
in
tow
of
a
steamer
decorated
with
red
flags
and
green
pine
boughs
and
managed
by
a
set
of
bold
active
fellows
whose
jovial
songs
waken
up
the
echoes
of
the
lonely
woods
i
have
seen
several
of
these
rafts
containing
many
thousand
pounds
worth
of
timber
taking
their
downward
course
in
one
day
the
centre
of
the
raft
is
generally
occupied
by
a
shanty
and
cooking
apparatus
and
at
night
it
presents
an
imposing
spectacle
seen
by
the
red
light
of
their
fires
as
it
glides
beneath
the
shadow
of
some
lofty
bank
with
its
dark
overhanging
trees
i
have
often
coveted
a
sail
on
those
picturesque
rafts
over
those
smooth
moonlighted
waters
the
bring
with
them
a
great
quantity
of
waste
timber
and
fallen
trees
from
the
interior
and
it
is
amusing
to
watch
the
poor
irishwomen
and
children
wading
to
the
waist
in
the
water
and
drawing
out
these
waifs
and
strays
with
hooked
sticks
to
supply
their
shanties
with
fuel
it
is
astonishing
how
much
an
industrious
lad
can
secure
in
a
day
of
this
refuse
timber
no
gleaner
ever
enters
a
in
canada
to
secure
a
small
portion
of
the
scattered
grain
but
the
floating
treasures
which
the
waters
yield
are
regarded
as
a
providential
supply
of
firing
which
is
always
gathered
in
these
are
often
productive
of
great
mischief
as
they
not
infrequently
carry
away
all
the
dams
and
bridges
along
their
course
this
generally
happens
after
an
unusually
severe
winter
accompanied
with
very
heavy
falls
of
snow
the
melting
of
the
snows
in
the
back
country
by
filling
all
the
tributary
creeks
and
streams
converts
the
larger
rivers
into
headlong
and
destructive
torrents
that
rush
and
foam
along
with
curbless
force
carrying
huge
blocks
of
ice
and
large
timbers
like
feathers
upon
their
surface
it
is
a
grand
and
beautiful
sight
the
coming
down
of
the
waters
during
one
of
these
spring
freshets
the
river
roars
and
rages
like
a
chafed
lion
and
frets
and
foams
against
its
rocky
barrier
as
if
determined
to
overcome
every
obstacle
that
dares
to
impede
its
furious
course
great
blocks
of
ice
are
seen
popping
up
and
down
in
the
boiling
surges
and
unwieldy
perform
the
most
extravagant
capers
often
starting
bolt
upright
while
their
crystal
neighbours
enraged
at
the
uncourteous
collision
turn
up
their
glittering
edges
with
an
air
of
defiance
and
tumble
about
in
the
current
like
mad
monsters
of
the
deep
the
blocks
of
ice
are
sometimes
lifted
entirely
out
of
the
water
by
the
force
of
the
current
and
deposited
upon
the
top
of
the
bank
where
they
form
an
irregular
wall
of
glass
glittering
and
melting
leisurely
in
the
heat
of
the
sun
a
stranger
who
had
not
witnessed
their
upheaval
might
well
wonder
by
what
gigantic
power
they
had
been
placed
there
in
march
a
severe
winter
was
terminated
by
a
very
sudden
thaw
accompanied
by
high
winds
and
deluges
of
rain
in
a
few
days
the
snow
was
all
gone
and
every
slope
and
hill
was
converted
into
a
drain
down
which
the
waters
rushed
continuously
to
the
river
the
roads
were
almost
impassable
and
on
the
of
the
month
the
river
rose
to
an
unusual
height
and
completely
filled
its
rocky
banks
the
floods
brought
down
from
the
interior
a
great
jam
of
ice
which
accumulating
in
size
and
altitude
at
every
bridge
and
dam
it
had
carried
away
in
its
course
towards
the
bay
was
at
length
arrested
in
its
progress
at
the
lower
bridge
where
the
ice
though
sunk
several
feet
below
the
rushing
waters
still
adhered
firmly
to
the
shore
vast
pieces
of
ice
were
piled
up
against
the
abutments
of
the
bridge
which
the
mountain
of
ice
threatened
to
annihilate
as
well
as
to
inundate
the
lower
end
of
the
town
it
presented
to
the
eager
and
excited
crowd
who
in
spite
of
the
impending
danger
rushed
to
the
devoted
bridge
a
curious
and
formidable
spectacle
imagine
dear
reader
a
huge
mass
composed
of
blocks
of
ice
large
stones
and
drift
timber
occupying
the
centre
of
the
river
and
extending
back
for
a
great
distance
the
top
on
a
level
with
the
roofs
of
the
houses
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
had
everything
to
dread
from
such
a
gigantic
applied
to
their
feeble
wooden
bridge
a
consultation
was
held
by
the
men
assembled
on
the
bridge
and
it
was
thought
that
the
danger
might
be
averted
by
sawing
asunder
the
ice
which
still
held
firm
and
allowing
a
free
passage
for
the
blocks
that
impeded
the
bridge
the
river
was
soon
covered
with
active
men
armed
with
axes
and
poles
some
freeing
the
ice
at
the
arch
of
the
bridge
others
attempting
to
push
the
iceberg
nearer
to
the
shore
where
if
once
stranded
it
would
melt
at
leisure
if
the
huge
pile
of
mischief
could
have
found
a
voice
it
would
have
laughed
at
their
fruitless
endeavours
while
watching
the
men
at
their
dangerous
and
as
it
proved
afterwards
hopeless
work
we
witnessed
an
act
of
extraordinary
courage
and
presence
of
mind
in
two
brothers
blacksmiths
in
the
town
one
of
these
young
men
was
busy
cutting
away
the
ice
just
above
the
bridge
when
quite
unexpectedly
the
piece
on
which
he
was
standing
gave
way
and
he
was
carried
with
the
speed
of
thought
under
the
bridge
his
death
appeared
inevitable
but
quick
as
his
exit
was
from
the
exciting
scene
the
love
in
the
brother
heart
was
as
quick
in
taking
measures
for
his
safety
as
the
ice
on
which
the
younger
lad
stood
parted
the
elder
sprang
into
the
hollow
box
of
wood
which
helped
to
support
the
arch
of
the
bridge
and
which
was
filled
with
great
stones
as
the
torrent
swept
his
brother
past
him
and
under
the
bridge
the
drowning
youth
gave
a
spring
from
the
ice
on
which
he
still
stood
and
the
other
bending
at
the
instant
from
his
perch
above
caught
him
by
the
collar
and
lifted
him
bodily
from
his
perilous
situation
all
was
the
work
of
a
moment
yet
the
spectators
held
their
breath
and
wondered
as
they
saw
it
was
an
act
of
bold
daring
on
the
one
hand
of
cool
determined
courage
on
the
other
it
was
a
joyful
sight
to
see
the
rescued
lad
in
his
brave
brother
arms
all
day
we
watched
from
the
bridge
the
hill
of
ice
wondering
when
it
would
take
a
fresh
start
and
if
it
would
carry
away
the
bridge
when
it
left
its
present
position
night
came
down
and
the
unwelcome
visitant
remained
stationary
the
air
was
cold
and
frosty
there
was
no
moon
and
the
spectators
were
reluctantly
forced
to
retire
to
their
respective
homes
between
the
watches
of
the
night
we
listened
to
the
roaring
of
the
river
and
speculated
upon
the
threatened
destruction
by
daybreak
my
eager
boys
were
upon
the
spot
to
ascertain
the
fate
of
the
bridge
all
was
grim
and
silent
the
ice
remained
like
a
giant
slumbering
upon
his
post
so
passed
the
greater
part
of
the
day
curiosity
was
worn
out
the
crowd
began
to
disperse
disappointed
that
the
ruin
they
anticipated
had
not
taken
place
just
as
some
persons
are
sorry
when
a
fire
which
has
caused
much
alarm
by
its
central
position
in
a
town
or
city
is
extinguished
without
burning
down
a
single
house
the
love
of
excitement
drowns
for
a
time
the
better
feelings
of
humanity
they
wish
any
person
to
suffer
injury
but
they
give
up
the
grand
spectacle
they
had
expected
to
witness
with
regret
at
four
in
the
afternoon
most
of
the
had
retired
disgusted
with
the
tardy
movements
of
the
ice
monster
when
a
cry
arose
from
the
banks
of
the
river
to
warn
the
few
persons
who
still
loitered
on
the
bridge
to
look
out
the
ice
was
in
motion
every
one
within
hearing
rushed
to
the
river
we
happened
to
be
passing
at
the
time
and
like
the
rest
hurried
to
the
spot
the
vast
pile
slowly
almost
imperceptibly
began
to
advance
giving
an
irresistible
impulse
to
the
shore
ice
that
still
held
good
and
which
was
instantly
communicated
to
the
large
pieces
that
blocked
the
arch
of
the
bridge
over
which
the
waves
now
poured
in
a
torrent
pushing
before
them
the
great
lumps
which
up
to
the
present
moment
had
been
immoveably
wedged
there
was
a
hollow
gurgling
sound
a
sullen
roar
of
waters
a
cracking
and
rending
of
the
ice
and
the
ponderous
mass
smote
the
bridge
it
parted
asunder
and
swift
as
an
arrow
the
crystal
mountain
glided
downwards
to
the
bay
spurning
from
its
base
the
waves
that
leaped
and
foamed
around
its
path
and
pouring
them
in
a
flood
of
waters
over
the
west
bank
of
the
river
beyond
the
loss
of
a
few
old
sheds
along
the
shore
very
little
damage
was
sustained
by
the
town
the
streets
near
the
wharfs
were
inundated
for
a
few
hours
and
the
cellars
filled
with
water
but
after
the
exit
of
the
iceberg
the
river
soon
subsided
into
its
usual
channel
the
winter
of
was
one
of
great
length
and
severity
the
snow
in
many
of
the
roads
was
level
with
the
top
rail
of
the
fences
and
the
spring
thaw
caused
heavy
freshets
through
the
colony
in
the
upper
part
of
the
province
particularly
on
the
grand
river
the
rising
of
the
waters
destroyed
a
large
amount
of
valuable
mill
property
one
lost
saw
logs
our
wild
bright
moira
was
swollen
to
the
brim
and
tumbled
along
with
the
impetuosity
of
a
mountain
torrent
its
course
to
the
bay
was
unimpeded
by
ice
which
had
been
all
carried
out
a
few
days
before
by
a
high
wind
but
vast
quantities
of
saw
logs
that
had
broken
away
from
their
bosoms
in
the
interior
were
plunging
in
the
current
sometimes
starting
bolt
upright
or
turning
over
and
over
as
if
endued
with
the
spirit
of
life
as
well
as
with
that
of
motion
several
of
these
heavy
timbers
had
struck
the
upper
bridge
and
carried
away
the
centre
arch
a
poor
cow
who
was
leisurely
pacing
over
to
her
shed
and
supper
was
suddenly
precipitated
into
the
din
of
waters
had
it
been
the
mayor
of
the
town
the
accident
could
scarcely
have
produced
a
greater
excitement
the
cow
belonged
to
a
poor
irishman
and
the
sympathy
of
every
one
was
enlisted
in
her
fate
was
it
possible
that
she
could
escape
drowning
amid
such
a
mad
roar
of
waves
no
human
arm
could
stem
for
a
moment
such
a
current
but
fortunately
for
our
heroine
she
was
not
human
but
only
a
stupid
quadruped
the
cow
for
a
few
seconds
seemed
bewildered
at
the
strange
situation
in
which
she
found
herself
so
unexpectedly
placed
but
she
was
wise
enough
and
skilful
enough
to
keep
her
head
above
water
and
she
cleared
two
before
she
became
aware
of
the
fact
and
she
accommodated
herself
to
her
critical
situation
with
a
stoical
indifference
which
would
have
done
credit
to
an
ancient
philosopher
after
passing
unhurt
over
the
dams
the
spectators
who
crowded
the
lower
bridges
to
watch
the
result
began
to
entertain
hopes
for
her
life
the
bridges
are
in
a
direct
line
and
about
half
a
mile
apart
on
came
the
cow
making
directly
for
the
centre
arch
of
the
bridge
on
which
we
stood
she
certainly
neither
swam
nor
felt
her
feet
but
was
borne
along
by
the
force
of
the
stream
my
eyes
i
wish
i
could
swim
as
well
as
that
ere
cow
cried
an
excited
boy
leaping
upon
the
top
of
the
bridge
i
guess
you
do
said
another
but
that
a
game
cow
there
no
boy
in
the
town
could
beat
her
she
will
never
pass
the
arch
of
the
bridge
said
a
man
sullenly
she
will
be
killed
against
the
abutment
jolly
she
through
the
arch
shouted
the
first
speaker
pat
has
saved
his
cow
she
not
ashore
yet
returned
the
man
and
she
begins
to
flag
not
a
bit
of
it
cried
the
excited
boy
the
old
looks
as
fresh
as
a
rose
hurrah
boys
let
us
run
down
to
the
wharf
and
see
what
becomes
of
her
off
scampered
the
juveniles
and
on
floated
the
cow
calm
and
in
the
midst
of
danger
after
passing
safely
through
the
arch
of
the
bridge
she
continued
to
steer
herself
out
of
the
current
and
nearer
to
the
shore
and
finally
effected
a
landing
in
where
she
quietly
walked
on
shore
to
the
great
admiration
of
the
youngsters
who
received
her
with
rapturous
shouts
of
applause
one
lad
seized
her
by
the
tail
another
grasped
her
horns
while
a
third
patted
her
dripping
neck
and
wished
her
joy
of
her
safe
landing
not
venus
herself
when
she
rose
from
the
sea
attracted
more
enthusiastic
admirers
than
did
the
poor
irishman
cow
a
party
composed
of
all
the
boys
in
the
place
led
her
in
triumph
through
the
streets
and
restored
her
to
her
rightful
owner
not
forgetting
to
bestow
upon
her
three
hearty
cheers
at
parting
a
little
black
boy
the
only
son
of
a
worthy
negro
who
had
been
a
settler
for
many
years
in
belleville
was
not
so
fortunate
as
the
irishman
cow
he
was
pushed
it
is
said
accidentally
from
the
broken
bridge
by
a
white
boy
of
his
own
age
into
that
hell
of
waters
and
it
was
many
weeks
before
his
body
was
found
it
had
been
carried
some
miles
down
the
bay
by
the
force
of
the
current
day
after
day
you
might
see
his
unhappy
father
armed
with
a
long
pole
with
a
hook
attached
to
it
mournfully
pacing
the
banks
of
the
swollen
river
in
the
hope
of
recovering
the
remains
of
his
lost
child
once
or
twice
we
stopped
to
speak
to
him
but
his
heart
was
too
full
to
answer
he
would
turn
away
with
the
tears
rolling
down
his
sable
cheeks
and
resume
his
melancholy
task
what
a
dreadful
thing
is
this
prejudice
against
race
and
colour
how
it
hardens
the
heart
and
locks
up
all
the
avenues
of
pity
the
premature
death
of
this
little
negro
excited
less
interest
in
the
breasts
of
his
white
companions
than
the
fate
of
the
cow
and
was
spoken
of
with
as
little
concern
as
the
drowning
of
a
pup
or
a
kitten
alas
this
river
moira
has
caused
more
tears
to
flow
from
the
eyes
of
parents
than
any
stream
of
the
like
size
in
the
province
heedless
of
danger
the
children
will
resort
to
its
shores
and
play
upon
the
timbers
that
during
the
summer
months
cover
its
surface
often
have
i
seen
a
fine
child
of
five
or
six
years
old
astride
of
a
riding
down
the
current
with
as
much
glee
as
if
it
were
a
real
steed
he
bestrode
if
the
log
turns
which
is
often
the
case
the
child
stands
a
great
chance
of
being
drowned
oh
agony
unspeakable
the
writer
of
this
lost
a
fine
talented
boy
of
six
years
one
to
whom
her
soul
clave
in
those
cruel
waters
but
i
will
not
dwell
upon
that
dark
hour
the
saddest
and
darkest
in
my
sad
eventful
life
many
years
ago
when
i
was
a
girl
myself
my
sympathies
were
deeply
excited
by
reading
an
account
of
the
grief
of
a
mother
who
had
lost
her
only
child
under
similar
circumstances
how
prophetic
were
those
lines
of
all
that
i
suffered
during
that
heavy
bereavement
the
mother
lament
oh
cold
at
my
feet
thou
wert
sleeping
my
boy
and
i
press
on
thy
pale
lips
in
vain
the
fond
kiss
earth
opens
her
arms
to
receive
thee
my
joy
and
all
my
past
sorrows
were
nothing
to
this
the
of
hope
thine
is
sleeping
no
more
to
arise
at
the
voice
of
my
weeping
oh
how
art
thou
changed
since
the
light
breath
of
morning
dispersed
the
soft
dewdrops
in
showers
from
the
tree
like
a
beautiful
bud
my
lone
dwelling
adorning
thy
smiles
call
up
feelings
of
rapture
in
me
i
thought
not
the
sunbeams
all
gaily
that
shone
on
thy
waking
at
night
would
behold
me
alone
the
joy
that
flash
out
from
thy
eyes
that
laugh
in
thy
dimples
and
brighten
thy
cheek
is
quench
but
the
smile
on
thy
pale
lip
that
lies
now
tells
of
a
joy
that
no
language
can
speak
the
fountain
is
seal
the
young
spirit
at
rest
oh
why
should
i
mourn
thee
my
lov
one
my
blest
the
anniversary
of
that
fatal
day
gave
birth
to
the
following

which
i

her

mirror
in
the
tide
the
town
of
belleville
in
contained
a
population
of
souls
or
thereabouts
the
few
streets
it
then
possessed
were
chiefly
composed
of
frame
houses
put
up
in
the
most
unartistic
and
irregular
fashion
their
gable
ends
or
fronts
turned
to
the
street
as
it
suited
the
whim
or
convenience
of
the
owner
without
the
least
regard
to
taste
or
neatness
at
that
period
there
were
only
two
stone
houses
and
two
of
brick
in
the
place
one
of
these
wonders
of
the
village
was
the
and
gaol
the
other
three
were
stores
the
dwellings
of
the
wealthier
portion
of
the
community
were
distinguished
by
a
coat
of
white
or
yellow
paint
with
green
or
brown
doors
and
window
blinds
while
the
houses
of
the
poorer
class
retained
the
dull
grey
which
the
plain
boards
always
assume
after
a
short
exposure
to
the
weather
in
spite
of
the
great
beauty
of
the
locality
it
was
but
an
insignificant
place
the
main
street
of
the
town
as
it
is
called
was
only
partially
paved
with
rough
slabs
of
limestone
and
these
were
put
so
carelessly
down
that
their
uneven
edges
and
the
difference
in
their
height
and
size
was
painful
to
the
pedestrian
and
destruction
to
his
shoes
leading
you
to
suppose
that
the
paving
committee
had
been
composed
of
shoemakers
in
spring
and
fall
the
mud
was
so
deep
in
the
centre
of
the
thoroughfare
that
it
required
you
to
look
twice
before
you
commenced
the
difficult
task
of
crossing
lest
you
might
chance
to
leave
your
shoes
sticking
fast
in
the
mud
this
i
actually
saw
a
lady
do
one
sunday
while
crossing
the
church
hill
belleville
had
just
been
incorporated
as
the
metropolitan
town
of
the
victoria
district
and
my
husband
presided
as
sheriff
in
the
first
court
ever
held
in
the
place
twelve
brief
years
have
made
a
wonderful
an
almost
miraculous
change
in
the
aspect
and
circumstances
of
the
town
a
stranger
who
had
not
visited
it
during
that
period
could
scarcely
recognize
it
as
the
same
it
has
more
than
doubled
its
dimensions
and
its
population
has
increased
to
upwards
of
souls
handsome
commodious
stores
filled
with
expensive
goods
from
the
mother
country
and
the
states
have
risen
in
the
place
of
the
small
dark
frame
buildings
and
large
hotels
have
jostled
into
obscurity
the
low
taverns
and
groceries
that
once
formed
the
only
places
of
entertainment
in
a
wooded
swamp
extended
almost
the
whole
way
from
belleville
to
cariff
mills
a
distance
of
three
miles
the
road
was
execrable
and
only
a
few
log
shanties
or
very
small
frame
houses
occurred
at
intervals
along
the
now
cariff
mills
is
as
large
as
belleville
was
in
and
boasts
of
a
population
of
upwards
of
inhabitants
a
fine
plank
road
connects
it
with
the
latter
place
and
the
whole
distance
is
one
continuous
street
many
of
the
houses
by
the
wayside
are
pretty
ornamental
cottages
composed
of
brick
or
stone
an
immense
traffic
in
flour
and
lumber
is
carried
on
at
this
place
and
the
plank
road
has
proved
a
very
lucrative
speculation
to
the
shareholders
in
there
was
but
one
bank
agency
in
belleville
now
there
are
four
three
of
which
do
a
great
business
at
that
period
we
had
no
market
although
saturday
was
generally
looked
upon
as
the
the
farmers
choosing
it
as
the
most
convenient
to
bring
to
town
their
farm
produce
for
sale
our
first
was
erected
in
it
was
built
of
wood
and
very
roughly
finished
this
proved
but
poor
economy
in
the
long
run
as
it
was
burnt
down
the
succeeding
year
a
new
and
more
commodious
one
of
brick
has
been
erected
in
its
place
and
it
is
tolerably
supplied
with
meat
and
vegetables
but
these
articles
are
both
dearer
and
inferior
in
quality
to
those
offered
in
kingston
and
toronto
this
perhaps
is
owing
to
the
tardiness
shown
by
the
farmers
in
bringing
in
their
produce
which
they
are
obliged
to
offer
first
for
sale
in
the
market
or
be
subjected
to
a
trifling
fine
there
is
very
little
competition
and
the
butchers
and
town
have
it
their
own
way
a
market
is
always
a
stirring
scene
here
politics
commercial
speculations
and
the
little
floating
gossip
of
the
village
are
freely
talked
over
and
discussed
to
those
who
feel
an
interest
in
the
study
of
human
nature
the
market
affords
an
ample
field
imagine
a
conversation
like
the
following
between
two
decently
dressed
wives
how
are
you
mrs
g
moderate
i
thank
you
did
you
hear
how
old
p
was
mortal
bad
why
you
do
say
our
folks
heard
that
he
was
getting
quite
smart
is
he
the
doctor
has
given
him
up
entirely
well
it
will
be
a
bad
job
for
the
family
if
he
goes
i
that
there
wo
be
money
enough
to
pay
his
debts
but
what
of
this
marriage
they
do
say
that
miss
a
is
to
be
married
to
old
mister
b
what
are
her
friends
thinking
about
to
let
that
young
gal
marry
that
old
man
the
money
to
be
sure
they
say
he
rich
if
he
rich
he
never
made
his
money
honestly
ah
he
came
of
a
bad
set
with
a
shake
of
the
head
and
so
they
go
on
talking
and
chatting
over
the
affairs
of
the
neighbourhood
in
succession
it
is
curious
to
watch
the
traits
of
character
exhibited
in
buyer
and
seller
both
exceed
the
bounds
of
truth
and
honesty
the
one
in
his
eagerness
to
sell
his
goods
bestowing
upon
them
the
most
unqualified
praise
the
other
depreciating
them
below
their
real
value
in
order
to
obtain
them
at
an
unreasonably
low
price
fine
beef
exclaims
an
anxious
butcher
watching
with
the
eye
of
a
hawk
a
respectable
citizen
wife
as
she
paces
slowly
and
irresolutely
in
front
of
his
stall
where
he
has
hung
out
for
sale
the
side
of
an
ox
neither
the
youngest
nor
fattest
fine
beef
none
better
to
be
had
in
the
district
what
shall
i
send
you
home

a
tender
steak
it
would
be
a
difficult
matter
to
do
that
responds
the
good
wife
with
some
asperity
in
look
and
tone
it
seems
hard
and
old
some
lean
cow
you
have
killed
to
save
her
from
dying
of
the
consumption
no
danger
of
the
fat
setting
fire
to
the
lum
suggests
a
rival
in
the
trade
here
a
fine
veal
fatted
upon
the
milk
of
two
cows
looks
says
the
comely
dame
passing
on
to
the
next
stall
as
if
it
had
been
starved
upon
the
milk
of
one
talking
of
markets
puts
me
in
mind
of
a
trick
a
wicked
trick
but
perhaps
not
the
less
amusing
on
that
account
that
was
played
off
in
toronto
market
last
year
by
a
young
medical
student
name
unknown
it
was
the
christmas
week
and
the
market
was
adorned
with
evergreens
and
dressed
with
all
possible
care
the
stalls
groaned
beneath
the
weight
of
good
cheer
fish
flesh
and
fowl
all
contributing
their
share
to
tempt
the
appetite
and
abstract
money
from
the
purse
it
was
a
sight
to
warm
the
heart
of
the
most
fastidious
epicure
and
give
him
the
nightmare
for
the
next
seven
nights
only
dreaming
of
that
stupendous
quantity
of
food
to
be
masticated
by
the
jaws
of
man
one
butcher
had
the
supreme
felicity
of
possessing
a
fine
fat
heifer
that
had
taken
the
prize
at
the
provincial
agricultural
show
and
the
monster
of
fat
which
was
justly
considered
the
pride
of
the
market
was
hung
up
in
the
most
conspicuous
place
in
order
to
attract
the
gaze
of
all
beholders
c
a
wealthy
doctor
of
laws
was
providing
good
cheer
for
the
entertainment
of
a
few
choice
friends
on
and
ordered
of
the
butcher
four
ribs
of
the
beef
the
man
unwilling
to
cut
up
the
animal
until
she
had
enjoyed
her
full
share
of
admiration
wrote
upon
a
piece
of
paper
in
large
characters
prize
heifer
four
ribs
for
c
this
he
pinned
upon
the
carcase
of
the
beast
shortly
after
the
doctor
quitted
the
market
and
a
very
fat
young
lady
and
her
mother
came
up
to
the
stall
to
make
some
purchases
our
student
was
leaning
carelessly
against
it
watching
with
bright
eyes
the
busy
scene
and
being
an
uncommonly
mischievous
fellow
and
very
fond
of
practical
jokes
a
thought
suddenly
struck
him
of
playing
off
one
upon
the
stout
young
lady
her
back
was
towards
him
and
dexterously
abstracting
the
aforementioned
placard
from
the
side
of
the
heifer
he
transferred
it
to
the
shawl
of
his
unsuspecting
victim
just
where
its
ample
folds
comfortably
encased
her
broad
shoulders
after
a
while
the
ladies
left
the
market
amidst
the
suppressed
titters
and
outstretched
of
butchers
and
hucksters
and
all
the
idle
loafers
the
generally
congregate
in
such
places
of
public
resort
all
up
the
length
of
king
street
walked
the
innocent
damsel
marvelling
that
the
public
attention
appeared
exclusively
bestowed
upon
her
still
as
she
passed
along
bursts
of
laughter
resounded
on
all
sides
and
the
words
prize
heifer
four
ribs
for
c
it
was
not
until
she
reached
her
own
dwelling
that
she
became
aware
of
the
trick
the
land
to
the
east
north
and
west
of
belleville
rises
to
a
considerable
height
and
some
of
the
back
townships
like
huntingdon
and
hungerford
abound
in
lofty
hills
there
is
in
the
former
township
on
the
road
leading
from
rawdon
village
to
luke
tavern
a
most
extraordinary
natural
phenomenon
the
road
for
several
miles
runs
along
the
top
of
a
sharp
ridge
so
narrow
that
it
leaves
barely
breadth
enough
for
two
waggons
to
pass
in
safety
this
ridge
is
composed
of
gravel
and
looks
as
if
it
had
been
subjected
to
the
action
of
water
on
either
side
of
this
huge
embankment
there
is
a
sheer
descent
into
a
finely
wooded
level
plain
below
through
which
wanders
a
lonely
creek
or
small
stream
i
do
know
what
the
height
of
this
ridge
is
above
the
level
of
the
meadow
but
it
must
be
very
considerable
as
you
look
down
upon
the
tops
of
the
loftiest
forest
trees
as
they
grow
far
far
beneath
you
the
road
is
well
fenced
on
either
side
or
it
would
require
some
courage
to
drive
young
skittish
horses
along
this
dangerous
pass
the
settlers
in
that
vicinity
have
given
to
this
singular
rise
the
name
of
the
ridge
road
there
is
a
sharp
ridge
of
limestone
at
the
back
of
the
township
of
thurlow
though
of
far
less
dimensions
which
looks
as
if
it
had
been
thrown
up
in
some
convulsion
of
the
earth
as
the
limestone
is
shattered
in
all
directions
the
same
thing
occurs
on
the
road
to
shannonville
a
small
but
flourishing
village
on
the
kingston
road
nine
miles
east
of
belleville
the
rock
is
heaved
up
in
the
middle
and
divided
by
deep
cracks
into
innumerable
fragments
i
put
a
long
stick
down
one
of
these
deep
cracks
without
reaching
the
bottom
and
as
i
gathered
a
lovely
bunch
of
harebells
that
were
waving
their
graceful
blossoms
over
the
barren
rock
i
thought
what
an
excellent
breeding
place
for
snakes
these
deep
fissures
must
make
but
to
return
to
belleville
the
west
side
of
the
river
a
flat
limestone
plain
scantily
covered
with
a
second
growth
of
dwarf
trees
and
bushes
has
not
as
yet
been
occupied
although
a
flourishing
village
that
has
sprung
up
within
a
few
years
crowns
the
ridge
above
the
plain
below
is
private
property
and
being
very
valuable
as
affording
excellent
sites
for
flour
and
saw
mills
has
been
reserved
in
order
to
obtain
a
higher
price
this
circumstance
has
doubtless
been
a
drawback
to
the
growth
of
the
town
in
that
direction
while
shutting
out
the
view
of
the
river
by
the
erection
of
large
buildings
will
greatly
diminish
the
natural
beauties
of
this
picturesque
spot
the
approach
to
belleville
both
from
the
east
and
west
is
down
a
very
steep
hill
the
town
lying
principally
in
the
valley
below
these
hills
command
a
beautiful
prospect
of
wood
and
water
and
of
a
rich
and
highly
cultivated
country
their
sides
are
adorned
with
fine
trees
which
have
grown
up
since
the
axe
first
levelled
the
primeval
forests
in
this
part
of
the
colony
a
circumstance
which
being
unusual
in
canada
round
new
settlements
forms
a
most
attractive
feature
in
the
landscape
a
more
delightful
summer
evening
ride
could
scarcely
be
pointed
out
than
along
the
trent
or
kingston
roads
and
it
would
be
a
difficult
thing
to
determine
which
afforded
the
most
varied
and
pleasing
prospect
residing
upon
the
west
hill
we
naturally
prefer
it
to
the
other
but
i
have
some
doubts
whether
it
is
really
the
prettiest
i
have
often
imagined
a
hundred
years
to
have
passed
away
and
the
lovely
sloping
banks
of
the
bay
of
quinte
crowned
with
rural
villages
and
stately
parks
and
houses
stretching
down
to
these
fair
waters
what
a
scene
of
fertility
and
beauty
rises
before
my
mental
vision
my
heart
swells
and
i
feel
proud
that
i
belong
to
a
race
who
in
every
portion
of
the
globe
in
which
they
have
planted
a
colony
have
proved
themselves
worthy
to
be
the
sires
of
a
great
nation
the
state
of
society
when
we
first
came
to
this
district
was
everything
but
friendly
or
agreeable
the
ferment
occasioned
by
the
impotent
rebellion
of
mackenzie
had
hardly
subsided
the
public
mind
was
in
a
sore
and
excited
state
men
looked
distrustfully
upon
each
other
and
the
demon
of
party
reigned
preeminent
as
much
in
the
in
the
the
town
was
divided
into
two
fierce
political
factions
and
however
moderate
your
views
might
be
to
belong
to
the
one
was
to
incur
the
dislike
and
of
the
other
the
tory
party
who
arrogated
the
whole
loyalty
of
the
colony
to
themselves
branded
indiscriminately
the
large
body
of
reformers
as
traitors
and
rebels
every
conscientious
and
thinking
man
who
wished
to
see
a
change
for
the
better
in
the
management
of
public
affairs
was
confounded
with
those
discontented
spirits
who
had
raised
the
standard
of
revolt
against
the
mother
country
in
justice
even
to
them
it
must
be
said
not
without
severe
provocation
and
their
disaffection
was
more
towards
the
colonial
government
and
the
abuses
it
fostered
than
any
particular
dislike
to
british
supremacy
or
institutions
their
attempt
whether
instigated
by
patriotism
or
selfishness
and
probably
it
contained
a
mixture
of
both
had
failed
and
it
was
but
just
that
they
should
feel
the
punishment
due
to
their
crime
but
the
odious
term
of
rebel
applied
to
some
of
the
most
loyal
and
honourable
men
in
the
province
because
they
could
not
give
up
their
honest
views
on
the
state
of
the
colony
gave
rise
to
bitter
and
resentful
feelings
which
were
ready
on
all
public
occasions
to
burst
into
a
flame
even
women
entered
deeply
into
this
party
hostility
and
those
who
from
their
education
and
mental
advantages
might
have
been
friends
and
agreeable
companions
kept
aloof
rarely
taking
notice
of
each
other
when
accidentally
thrown
together
the
canadian
regarded
with
a
jealous
feeling
men
of
talent
and
respectability
who
emigrated
from
the
mother
country
as
most
offices
of
consequence
and
emolument
were
given
to
such
persons
the
canadian
naturally
enough
considered
such
preference
unjust
and
an
infringement
upon
his
rights
as
a
native
of
the
colony
and
that
he
had
a
greater
claim
on
that
account
upon
the
government
than
men
who
were
perfect
strangers
this
owing
to
his
limited
education
was
not
always
the
case
but
the
preference
shown
to
the
british
emigrant
proved
an
active
source
of
and
discontent
the
favoured
occupant
of
place
and
power
was
not
at
all
inclined
to
conciliate
his
canadian
rival
or
to
give
up
the
title
to
mental
superiority
which
he
derived
from
birth
and
education
and
he
too
often
treated
his
illiterate
but
sagacious
political
opponent
with
a
contempt
which
his
practical
knowledge
and
experience
did
not
merit
it
was
a
miserable
state
of
things
and
i
believe
that
most
large
towns
in
the
province
bore
in
these
respects
a
striking
resemblance
to
each
other
those
who
wished
to
see
impartial
justice
administered
to
all
had
but
an
uncomfortable
time
of
it
both
parties
regarding
with
mistrust
those
men
who
could
not
go
the
whole
length
with
them
in
their
political
opinions
to
gain
influence
in
canada
and
be
the
leader
of
a
party
a
man
must
as
the
yankees
say
go
the
whole
hog
the
people
in
the
back
woods
were
fortunate
in
not
having
their
peace
disturbed
by
these
political
broils
in
the
depths
of
the
dark
forest
they
were
profoundly
ignorant
of
how
the
colony
was
governed
and
many
did
not
even
know
which
party
was
in
power
and
when
the
rebellion
actually
broke
out
it
fell
upon
them
like
a
but
in
their
ignorance
and
seclusion
there
was
at
least
safety
and
they
were
free
from
that
dreadful
scourge
the
malicious
strife
of
tongues
the
fever
of
the
clergy
reserves
question
was
then
at
its
height
it
was
never
introduced
in
company
but
to
give
offence
and
lead
to
fierce
political
discussions
all
parties
were
wrong
and
nobody
was
convinced
this
vexed
political
question
always
brought
before
my
mental
vision
a
ludicrous
sort
of
caricature
which
if
i
had
the
artistic
skill
to
delineate
would
form
no
bad
illustration
of
this
perplexing
subject
i
saw
in
my
mind
eye
a
group
of
dogs
in
the
marketplace
of
a
large
town
to
whom
some
benevolent
individual
with
a
view
to
their
mutual
benefit
had
flung
a
shank
of
beef
with
meat
enough
upon
the
upper
end
to
have
satisfied
the
hunger
of
all
could
such
an
impossible
thing
as
an
equal
division
among
such
noisy
claimants
have
been
made
a
strong
english
immediately
seized
upon
the
bone
and
for
some
time
gnawed
away
at
the
best
end
of
it
and
contrived
to
keep
all
the
other
dogs
at
bay
this
proceeding
was
resented
by
a
stout
mastiff
who
thought
that
he
had
as
good
a
right
to
the
beef
as
the
and
flung
himself
tooth
and
claw
upon
his
opponent
while
these
two
were
fighting
and
wrangling
over
the
bone
a
wiry
active
scotch
terrier
though
but
half
the
size
of
the
other
combatants
began
tugging
at
the
small
end
of
the
shank
snarling
and
barking
with
all
the
strength
of
his
lungs
to
gain
at
least
a
chance
of
being
heard
even
if
he
did
fail
in
putting
in
his
claims
to
a
share
of
the
meat
an
old
cunning
greyhound
to
whom
no
share
had
been
offered
and
who
well
knew
that
it
was
of
no
use
putting
himself
against
the
strength
of
the
and
mastiff
stood
proudly
aloof
with
quivering
ears
and
tail
regarding
the
doings
of
the
others
with
a
glance
of
sovereign
contempt
yet
watching
with
his
keen
eye
for
an
opportunity
of
making
a
successful
spring
while
they
were
busily
engaged
in
snarling
and
biting
each
other
to
carry
off
the
meat
bone
and
all
a
multitude
of
nondescript
curs
of
no
weight
in
themselves
were
snapping
and
snuffling
round
the
bone
eagerly
anticipating
the
few
tit
bits
which
they
hoped
might
fall
to
their
share
during
the
prolonged
scuffle
among
the
higher
powers
while
the
figure
of
justice
dimly
seen
in
the
distance
was
poising
her
scales
and
lifting
her
sword
to
make
an
equal
division
but
her
voice
failed
to
be
heard
and
her
august
presence
regarded
in
the
universal
hubbub
the
height
to
which
party
feeling
was
carried
in
those
days
had
to
be
experienced
before
it
could
be
fully
understood
happily
for
the
colony
this
evil
spirit
during
the
last
three
years
has
greatly
diminished
the
two
rival
parties
though
they
occasionally
abuse
and
vilify
each
other
through
the
medium
of
the
common
safety
valve
the
public
papers
are
not
so
virulent
as
in
they
are
more
equally
matched
the
union
of
the
provinces
has
kept
the
reform
party
in
the
ascendant
and
they
are
very
indifferent
to
the
good
or
ill
opinion
of
their
opponents
the
colony
has
greatly
progressed
under
their
administration
and
is
now
in
a
most
prosperous
and
flourishing
state
the
municipal
and
district
councils
free
schools
and
the
improvement
in
the
public
thoroughfares
of
the
country
are
owing
to
them
and
have
proved
a
great
blessing
to
the
community
the
resources
of
the
country
are
daily
being
opened
up
and
both
at
home
and
abroad
canada
is
rising
in
public
estimation
as
a
woman
i
can
not
enter
into
the
philosophy
of
these
things
nor
is
it
my
intention
to
do
so
i
leave
statistics
for
wiser
and
cleverer
male
heads
but
even
as
a
woman
i
can
not
help
rejoicing
in
the
beneficial
effects
that
these
changes
have
wrought
in
the
land
of
my
adoption
the
day
of
our
commercial
and
national
prosperity
has
dawned
and
the
rays
of
the
sun
already
brighten
the
to
those
persons
who
have
been
brought
up
in
the
old
country
and
accustomed
from
infancy
to
adhere
to
the
conventional
rules
of
society
the
mixed
society
must
for
a
long
time
prove
very
distasteful
yet
this
very
freedom
which
is
so
repugnant
to
all
their
preconceived
notions
and
prejudices
is
by
no
means
so
unpleasant
as
strangers
would
be
led
to
imagine
a
certain
mixture
of
the
common
and
the
real
of
the
absurd
and
the
ridiculous
gives
a
zest
to
the
cold
tame
decencies
to
be
found
in
more
exclusive
and
refined
circles
human
passions
and
feelings
are
exhibited
with
more
fidelity
and
you
see
men
and
women
as
they
really
are
and
many
kind
good
and
noble
traits
are
to
be
found
among
those
classes
whom
at
home
we
regard
as
our
inferiors
the
lady
and
gentleman
in
canada
are
as
distinctly
marked
as
elsewhere
there
is
no
mistaking
the
superiority
that
mental
cultivation
bestows
and
their
mingling
in
public
with
their
less
gifted
neighbours
rather
adds
than
takes
from
their
claims
to
hold
the
first
place
i
consider
the
state
of
society
in
a
more
healthy
condition
than
at
home
and
people
when
they
go
out
for
pleasure
here
seem
to
enjoy
themselves
much
more
the
harmony
that
reigns
among
the
members
of
a
canadian
family
is
truly
delightful
they
are
not
a
quarrelsome
people
in
their
own
homes
no
contradicting
or
disputing
or
hateful
rivalry
is
to
be
seen
between
canadian
brothers
and
sisters
they
cling
together
through
good
and
ill
report
like
the
bundle
of
sticks
in
the
fable
and
i
have
seldom
found
a
real
canadian
ashamed
of
owning
a
poor
relation
this
to
me
is
a
beautiful
feature
in
the
canadian
character
perhaps
the
perfect
equality
on
which
children
stand
in
a
family
the
superior
claim
of
eldership
so
much
upheld
at
home
never
being
enforced
is
one
great
cause
of
this
domestic
union
of
kindred
hearts
most
of
the
pretence
and
affected
airs
of
importance
occasionally
met
with
in
canada
are
not
the
genuine
produce
of
the
soil
but
importations
from
the
mother
country
and
as
sure
as
you
hear
any
one
boasting
of
the
rank
and
consequence
they
possessed
at
home
you
may
be
certain
that
it
was
quite
the
reverse
an
old
dutch
lady
after
listening
very
attentively
to
a
young
irishwoman
account
of
the
grandeur
of
her
father
family
at
home
said
rather
drily
to
the
damsel
goodness
me
child
if
you
were
so
well
off
what
brought
you
to
a
poor
country
like
this
i
am
sure
you
had
been
much
wiser
had
you
staid
to
hum
yes
but
my
papa
heard
such
fine
commendations
of
the
country
that
he
sold
his
estate
to
come
out
to
pay
his
debts
perhaps
said
the
provoking
old
woman
ah
no
she
replied
very
innocently
he
never
paid
them
he
was
told
that
it
was
a
very
fine
climate
and
he
came
for
the
good
of
our
health
why
my
dear
you
look
as
if
you
never
had
had
a
day
sickness
in
your
life
no
more
i
have
she
replied
putting
on
a
very
languid
air
but
i
am
very
this
term
be
it
known
to
my
readers
is
a
favourite
one
with
young
ladies
here
but
its
general
application
would
lead
you
to
imagine
it
another
term
for
it
is
quite
fashionable
to
be
but
horribly
vulgar
to
be
considered
capable
of
enjoying
such
a
useless
blessing
as
good
health
i
knew
a
lady
when
i
first
came
to
the
colony
who
had
her
children
daily
washed
in
water
almost
hot
enough
to
scald
a
pig
on
being
asked
why
she
did
so
as
it
was
not
only
an
unhealthy
practice
but
would
rob
the
little
girls
of
their
fine
colour
she
exclaimed
oh
that
is
just
what
i
do
it
for
i
want
them
to
look
they
have
such
red
faces
and
are
as
coarse
and
healthy
as
country
girls
the
rosy
face
of
the
british
emigrant
is
regarded
as
no
beauty
here
the
canadian
women
like
their
neighbours
the
americans
have
small
regular
features
but
are
mostly
pale
or
their
faces
are
only
slightly
suffused
with
a
faint
flush
during
the
season
of
youth
this
delicate
tinting
is
very
beautiful
but
a
few
years
deprive
them
of
it
and
leave
a
sickly
sallow
pallor
in
its
place
the
loss
of
their
teeth
too
is
a
great
drawback
to
their
personal
charms
but
these
can
be
so
well
supplied
by
the
dentist
that
it
is
not
so
much
felt
the
thing
is
so
universal
that
it
is
hardly
thought
detrimental
to
an
otherwise
pretty
face
but
to
return
to
the
mere
pretenders
in
society
of
which
of
course
there
are
not
a
few
here
as
elsewhere
i
once
met
two
very
women
at
a
place
of
public
entertainment
the
father
of
these
ladies
had
followed
the
lucrative
but
unaristocratic
trade
of
a
tailor
in
london
one
of
them
began
complaining
to
me
of
the
mixed
state
of
society
in
canada
which
she
considered
a
dreadful
calamity
to
persons
like
her
and
her
sister
and
ended
her
lamentations
by
exclaiming
what
would
my
pa
have
thought
could
he
have
seen
us
here
is
it
not
terrible
for
ladies
to
have
to
dance
in
the
same
room
with
storekeepers
and
their
clerks
another
lady
of
the
same
stamp
the
daughter
of
a
was
indignant
at
being
introduced
to
a
gentleman
whose
father
had
followed
the
same
calling
such
persons
seem
to
forget
that
as
long
as
people
retain
their
natural
manners
and
remain
true
to
the
dignity
of
their
humanity
they
can
not
with
any
justice
be
called
vulgar
for
vulgarity
consists
in
presumptuously
affecting
to
be
what
we
are
not
and
in
claiming
distinctions
which
we
do
not
deserve
and
which
no
one
else
would
admit
the
farmer
in
his
homespun
may
possess
the
real
essentials
which
make
the
gentleman
good
feeling
and
respect
for
the
feelings
of
others
the
homely
dress
face
and
hard
hands
could
not
deprive
him
of
the
honest
independence
and
genial
benevolence
he
derived
from
nature
no
real
gentleman
would
treat
such
a
man
however
humble
his
circumstances
with
insolence
or
contempt
but
place
the
same
man
out
of
his
class
dress
him
in
the
height
of
fashion
and
let
him
attempt
to
imitate
the
manners
of
the
great
and
the
whole
world
would
laugh
at
the
counterfeit
uneducated
ignorant
people
often
rise
by
their
industry
to
great
wealth
in
the
colony
to
such
the
preference
shown
to
the
educated
man
always
seems
a
puzzle
their
ideas
of
gentility
consist
in
being
the
owners
of
fine
clothes
fine
houses
splendid
furniture
expensive
equipages
and
plenty
of
money
they
have
all
these
yet
even
the
most
ignorant
feel
that
something
else
is
required
they
can
not
comprehend
the
mysterious
ascendancy
of
mind
over
mere
animal
enjoyments
yet
they
have
sense
enough
by
bestowing
a
liberal
education
on
their
children
to
endeavour
at
least
in
their
case
to
remedy
the
evil
the
affectation
of
wishing
people
to
think
that
you
had
been
better
off
in
the
mother
country
than
in
canada
is
not
confined
to
the
higher
class
of
emigrants
the
very
poorest
are
the
most
remarked
for
this
ridiculous
boasting
a
servant
girl
of
mine
told
me
with
a
very
grand
toss
of
the
head
that
she
did
not
choose
to
herself
by
scrubbing
a
floor
that
she
belonged
to
the
in
the
ould
counthry
and
her
papa
and
mamma
niver
brought
her
up
to
hard
work
this
interesting
scion
of
the
aristocracy
was
one
of
the
coarsest
specimens
of
female
humanity
i
ever
beheld
if
i
called
her
to
bring
a
piece
of
wood
for
the
parlour
fire
she
would
thrust
her
tangled
uncombed
red
head
in
at
the
door
and
shout
at
the
top
of
her
voice
did
yer
holler
one
of
our
working
men
wishing
to
impress
me
with
the
dignity
of
his
wife
connexions
said
with
all
becoming
solemnity
of
look
and
manner
doubtless
you
have
heard
in
the
ould
counthry
of
racers
margaret
father
kept
those
racers
when
i
recalled
the
person
of
the
individual
whose
fame
was
so
widely
spread
at
home
and
thought
of
the
racers
i
could
hardly
keep
a
straight
face
as
an
american
friend
terms
laughing
when
you
are
bound
to
look
grave
one
want
is
greatly
felt
here
but
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
a
more
liberal
system
of
education
and
higher
moral
culture
will
remedy
the
evil
there
is
a
great
deficiency
among
our
professional
men
and
wealthy
traders
of
that
nice
sense
of
honour
that
marks
the
conduct
and
dealings
of
the
same
class
at
home
of
course
many
bright
exceptions
are
to
be
found
in
the
colony
but
too
many
of
the
canadians
think
it
no
disgrace
to
take
every
advantage
of
the
ignorance
and
inexperience
of
strangers
if
you
are
not
smart
enough
to
drive
a
close
bargain
they
consider
it
only
fair
to
take
you
in
a
man
loses
very
little
in
the
public
estimation
by
making
over
all
his
property
to
some
convenient
friend
in
order
to
defraud
his
creditors
while
he
retains
a
competency
for
himself
women
whose
husbands
have
been
detained
on
the
limits
for
years
for
debt
will
give
large
parties
and
dress
in
the
most
expensive
style
this
would
be
thought
dishonourable
at
home
but
is
considered
no
disgrace
here
honour
is
all
very
well
in
an
old
country
like
england
said
a
lady
with
whom
i
had
been
arguing
on
the
subject
but
m
it
do
in
a
new
country
like
this
you
may
as
well
cheat
as
be
cheated
for
my
part
i
never
lose
an
advantage
by
indulging
in
such
foolish
notions
i
have
no
doubt
that
a
person
who
entertained
such
principles
would
not
fail
to
reduce
them
to
practice
the
idea
that
some
country
people
form
of
an
author
is
highly
amusing
one
of
my
boys
was
tauntingly
told
by
another
lad
at
school
that
his
ma
said
that
m
invented
lies
and
got
money
for
them
this
was
her
estimation
of
works
of
mere
fiction
once
i
was
driven
by
a
young
irish
friend
to
call
upon
the
wife
of
a
rich
farmer
in
the
country
we
were
shewn
by
the
master
of
the
house
into
a
very
handsomely
furnished
room
in
which
there
was
no
lack
of
substantial
comfort
and
even
of
some
elegancies
in
the
shape
of
books
pictures
and
a
piano
the
good
man
left
us
to
inform
his
wife
of
our
arrival
and
for
some
minutes
we
remained
in
solemn
state
until
the
mistress
of
the
house
made
her
appearance
she
had
been
called
from
the
washtub
and
like
a
sensible
woman
was
not
ashamed
of
her
domestic
occupation
she
came
in
wiping
the
suds
from
her
hands
on
her
apron
and
gave
us
a
very
hearty
and
friendly
welcome
she
was
a
short
stout
woman
with
a
very
pleasing
countenance
and
though
only
in
her
coloured
flannel
with
a
nightcap
on
her
head
and
spectacled
nose
there
was
something
in
her
frank
face
that
greatly
prepossessed
us
in
her
favour
after
giving
us
the
common
compliments
of
the
day
she
drew
her
chair
just
in
front
of
me
and
resting
her
elbows
on
her
knees
and
dropping
her
chin
between
her
hands
she
sat
regarding
me
with
such
a
fixed
gaze
that
it
became
very
embarrassing
so
says
she
at
last
you
are
mrs
m
yes
the
woman
that
writes
the
same
she
drew
back
her
chair
for
a
few
paces
with
a
sigh
in
which
disappointment
and
surprise
seemed
strangely
to
mingle
well
i
have
a
great
deal
about
you
and
i
wanted
to
see
you
bad
for
a
long
time
but
you
are
only
a
humly
person
like
myself
after
all
why
i
do
think
if
i
had
on
my
best
gown
and
cap
i
should
look
a
great
deal
younger
and
better
than
you
i
told
her
that
i
had
no
doubt
of
the
fact
and
pray
continued
she
with
the
same
provoking
scrutiny
how
old
do
you
call
yourself
i
told
her
my
exact
age
humph
quoth
she
as
if
she
rather
doubted
my
word
two
years
younger
nor
me
you
look
a
great
deal
older
nor
that
after
a
long
pause
and
another
searching
gaze
do
you
call
those
teeth
your
own
yes
said
i
laughing
for
i
could
retain
my
gravity
no
longer
in
the
very
truest
sense
of
the
word
they
are
mine
as
god
gave
them
to
me
you
luckier
than
your
neighbours
said
she
but
air
you
greatly
troubled
with
headaches
no
said
i
rather
startled
at
this
fresh
interrogatory
my
exclaimed
she
i
thought
you
must
be
your
eyes
are
so
sunk
in
your
head
well
well
so
you
are
m
of
belleville
the
woman
that
writes
you
are
but
a
humly
body
after
all
while
this
curious
colloquy
was
going
on
my
poor
irish
friend
sat
on
thorns
and
tried
by
throwing
in
a
little
judicious
blarney
to
soften
the
thrusts
of
the
home
truths
to
which
he
had
unwittingly
exposed
me
between
every
pause
in
the
conversation
he
broke
in
with
i
am
sure
m
is
a
woman
a
very
woman
for
her
age
any
person
might
know
at
a
glance
that
those
teeth
were
her
own
they
look
too
natural
to
be
false
now
i
am
certain
that
the
poor
little
woman
never
meant
to
wound
my
feelings
nor
give
me
offence
she
literally
spoke
her
thoughts
and
i
was
too
much
amused
with
the
whole
scene
to
feel
the
least
irritated
by
her
honest
bluntness
she
expected
to
find
in
an
author
something
quite
out
of
the
common
way
and
i
did
not
come
up
at
all
to
her
expectations
her
opinion
of
me
was
not
more
absurd
than
the
remarks
of
two
ladies
who
after
calling
upon
me
for
the
first
time
communicated
the
result
of
their
observations
to
a
mutual
friend
we
have
seen
m
and
we
were
so
surprised
to
find
her
just
like
other
people
what
did
you
expect
to
see
in
her
oh
something
very
different
we
were
very
much
disappointed
that
she
was
not
sitting
upon
her
head
said
my
friend
smiling
i
like
m
because
she
is
in
every
respect
like
other
people
and
i
should
not
have
taken
her
for
a
at
all
the
sin
of
authorship
meets
with
little
toleration
in
a
new
country
several
persons
of
this
class
finding
few
minds
that
could
sympathise
with
them
and
enter
into
their
literary
pursuits
have
yielded
to
despondency
or
fallen
victims
to
that
insidious
enemy
of
souls
such
a
spirit
was
the
unfortunate
huskins
late
of
frankfort
on
the
river
trent
the
fate
of
this
gentleman
who
was
a
learned
and
accomplished
man
of
genius
left
a
very
sad
impression
on
my
mind
like
too
many
of
that
but
unhappy
fraternity
he
struggled
through
his
brief
life
overwhelmed
with
the
weight
of
undeserved
calumny
and
his
peace
of
mind
embittered
with
the
most
galling
neglect
and
poverty
the
want
of
sympathy
experienced
by
him
from
men
of
his
own
class
pressed
sorely
upon
the
heart
of
the
sensitive
man
of
talent
and
refinement
he
found
very
few
who
could
appreciate
or
understand
his
mental
superiority
which
was
pronounced
as
folly
and
madness
by
the
ignorant
persons
about
him
a
new
country
where
all
are
rushing
eagerly
forward
in
order
to
secure
the
common
necessaries
of
life
is
not
a
favourable
soil
in
which
to
nourish
the
bright
fancies
and
delusive
dreams
of
the
poet
huskins
perceived
his
error
too
late
when
he
no
longer
retained
the
means
to
remove
to
a
more
favourable
spot
and
his
was
not
a
mind
which
could
meet
and
combat
successfully
with
the
ills
of
life
he
endeavoured
to
bear
proudly
the
evils
of
his
situation
but
he
had
neither
the
energy
nor
the
courage
to
surmount
them
he
withdrew
himself
from
society
and
passed
the
remainder
of
his
days
in
a
solitary
comfortless
log
hut
on
the
borders
of
the
wilderness
here
he
drooped
and
died
as
too
many
like
him
have
died
heartbroken
and
alone
a
sad
mystery
involves
the
last
hours
of
his
life
it
is
said
that
he
and
sutor
another
talented
but
very
dissipated
man
had
entered
into
a
compact
to
drink
until
they
both
died
whether
this
statement
is
true
can
not
now
be
positively
ascertained
it
is
certain
however
that
sutor
was
found
dead
upon
the
floor
of
the
miserable
shanty
occupied
by
his
friend
and
that
huskins
was
lying
on
his
bed
in
the
agonies
of
death
could
the
many
fine
poems
composed
by
huskins
in
his
solitary
exile
be
collected
and
published
we
feel
assured
that
posterity
would
do
him
justice
and
that
his
name
would
rank
high
among
the
bards
of
the
green
isle
to
the
memory
of
huskins
neglected
son
of
genius
thou
hast
in
loneliness
away
and
one
who
prized
thy
talents
fain
would
cast
the
above
thy
nameless
clay
ah
could
she
yet
thy
spirit
flight
delay
till
the
cold
world
relenting
from
its
scorn
the
fadeless
laurel
round
thy
brows
should
twine
crowning
the
innate
majesty
of
mind
by
crushing
poverty
and
sorrow
torn
peace
to
thy
ashes
till
revive
bright
memories
of
thee
in
deathless
song
true
to
the
dead
time
shall
relenting
give
the
meed
of
fame
deserved
delayed
too
long
and
in
immortal
verse
the
bard
again
shall
live
alas
this
frightful
vice
of
drinking
prevails
throughout
the
colony
to
an
alarming
extent
professional
gentlemen
are
not
ashamed
of
being
seen
issuing
from
the
of
a
tavern
early
in
the
morning
or
of
being
caught
reeling
home
from
the
same
sink
of
iniquity
late
at
night
no
sense
of
shame
seems
to
deter
them
from
the
pursuit
of
their
darling
sin
i
have
heard
that
some
of
these
regular
topers
place
brandy
beside
their
beds
that
should
they
awake
during
the
night
they
may
have
within
their
reach
the
fiery
potion
for
which
they
are
bartering
body
and
soul
some
of
these
persons
after
having
been
warned
of
their
danger
by
repeated
fits
of
have
joined
the
but
their
abstinence
only
lasted
until
the
of
their
health
enabled
them
to
return
to
their
old
haunts
and
become
more
hardened
in
their
vile
habits
than
before
it
is
to
be
questioned
whether
the
signing
of
any
pledge
is
likely
to
prove
a
permanent
remedy
for
this
great
moral
evil
if
an
appeal
to
the
heart
and
conscience
and
the
fear
of
incurring
the
displeasure
of
an
offended
god
are
not
sufficient
to
deter
a
man
from
becoming
an
active
instrument
in
the
ruin
of
himself
and
family
no
forcible
restraint
upon
his
animal
desires
will
be
likely
to
effect
a
real
reformation
it
appears
to
me
that
the
temperance
people
begin
at
the
wrong
end
of
the
matter
by
restraining
the
animal
propensities
before
they
have
convinced
the
mind
if
a
man
abstain
from
drink
only
as
long
as
the
accursed
thing
is
placed
beyond
his
reach
it
is
after
all
but
a
negative
virtue
to
be
overcome
by
the
first
strong
temptation
were
incurable
drunkards
treated
as
lunatics
and
a
proper
asylum
provided
for
them
in
every
large
town
and
the
management
of
their
affairs
committed
to
their
wives
or
adult
children
the
bare
idea
of
being
confined
under
such
a
plea
would
operate
more
forcibly
upon
them
than
by
signing
a
pledge
which
they
can
break
or
resume
according
to
the
caprice
of
the
moment
a
drunkard
while
under
the
influence
of
liquor
is
a
madman
in
every
sense
of
the
word
and
his
mental
aberration
is
often
of
the
most
dangerous
kind
place
him
and
the
confirmed
maniac
side
by
side
and
it
would
be
difficult
for
a
stranger
to
determine
which
was
the
most
irrational
of
the
two
a
friend
related
to
me
the
following
anecdote
of
a
physician
in
his
native
town
this
man
who
was
eminent
in
his
profession
and
highly
respected
by
all
who
knew
him
secretly
indulged
in
the
pernicious
habit
of
and
after
a
while
bade
fair
to
sink
into
a
hopeless
drunkard
at
the
earnest
solicitations
of
his
weeping
wife
and
daughter
he
consented
to
sign
the
pledge
and
not
only
ardent
spirits
but
every
sort
of
intoxicating
beverage
was
banished
from
the
house
the
use
of
alcohol
is
allowed
in
cases
of
sickness
to
the
most
rigid
disciplinarians
and
our
doctor
began
to
find
that
keeping
his
pledge
was
a
more
difficult
matter
than
he
had
at
first
imagined
still
for
of
course
a
man
of
his
standing
in
society
had
only
joined
for
he
did
not
like
openly
to
break
it
he
therefore
feigned
violent
toothache
and
sent
the
servant
girl
over
to
a
friend
house
to
borrow
a
small
phial
of
brandy
the
brandy
was
sent
with
many
kind
wishes
for
the
doctor
speedy
recovery
the
phial
now
came
every
night
to
be
refilled
and
the
doctor
toothache
seemed
likely
to
become
a
case
of
incurable
his
friend
took
the
alarm
he
found
it
both
expensive
and
inconvenient
providing
the
doctor
with
his
nightly
dose
and
wishing
to
see
how
matters
really
stood
he
followed
the
maid
and
the
brandy
one
evening
to
the
doctor
house
he
entered
unannounced
it
was
as
he
suspected
the
doctor
was
lounging
in
his
easy
chair
before
the
fire
indulging
in
a
hearty
fit
of
laughter
over
some
paragraph
in
a
newspaper
which
he
held
in
his
hand
ah
my
dear
j
i
am
so
glad
to
find
you
so
well
i
thought
by
your
sending
for
the
brandy
that
you
were
dying
with
the
toothache
the
doctor
rather
confounded
why
yes
i
have
been
sadly
troubled
with
it
of
late
it
does
not
come
on
however
before
eight
and
if
i
can
not
get
a
mouthful
of
brandy
i
never
can
get
a
wink
of
sleep
all
night
did
you
ever
have
it
before
you
took
the
pledge
never
said
the
doctor
emphatically
perhaps
the
cold
water
does
not
agree
with
you
the
doctor
began
to
smell
a
rat
and
fell
vigorously
to
minding
the
fire
i
tell
you
what
it
is
j
said
the
other
the
toothache
is
a
it
is
the
that
is
the
it
may
cure
you
of
an
imaginary
toothache
but
i
assure
you
that
it
gives
your
wife
and
daughter
an
the
doctor
felt
at
that
moment
a
strange
palpitation
at
his
own
the
scales
fell
suddenly
from
his
eyes
and
for
the
first
time
his
conduct
appeared
in
its
true
light
returning
the
bottle
to
his
friend
he
said
very
humbly
take
it
out
of
my
sight
i
feel
my
error
now
i
will
cure
their
heartache
by
curing
myself
of
this
beastly
vice
the
doctor
from
that
hour
became
a
temperate
man
he
soon
regained
his
failing
practice
and
the
esteem
of
his
friends
the
appeal
of
his
better
feelings
effected
a
permanent
change
in
his
habits
which
signing
the
pledge
had
not
been
able
to
do
to
keep
up
an
appearance
of
consistency
he
had
had
recourse
to
a
mean
subterfuge
while
touching
his
heart
produced
a
lasting
reform
drinking
is
the
curse
of
canada
and
the
very
low
price
of
whisky
places
the
temptation
constantly
in
every
one
reach
but
it
is
not
by
adopting
by
main
force
the
maine
liquor
law
that
our
legislators
will
be
able
to
remedy
the
evil
men
naturally
resist
any
oppressive
measures
that
infringe
upon
their
private
rights
even
though
such
measures
are
adopted
solely
for
their
benefit
it
is
not
wise
to
thrust
temperance
down
a
man
throat
and
the
surest
way
to
make
him
a
drunkard
is
to
insist
upon
his
being
sober
the
zealous
advocates
of
this
measure
and
there
are
many
in
canada
know
little
of
their
own
or
the
nature
of
others
it
would
be
the
fruitful
parent
of
hypocrisy
and
lay
the
foundation
of
crimes
still
greater
than
the
one
it
is
expected
to
cure
to
wean
a
from
the
indulgence
of
a
gross
sensual
propensity
as
i
said
before
we
must
first
convince
the
mind
the
reform
must
commence
there
merely
withdrawing
the
means
of
gratification
and
treating
a
rational
being
like
a
child
will
never
achieve
a
great
moral
conquest
in
pagan
countries
the
missionaries
can
only
rely
upon
the
sincerity
of
the
converts
who
are
educated
when
children
in
their
schools
and
if
we
wish
to
see
drunkenness
banished
from
our
towns
and
cities
we
must
prepare
our
children
from
their
earliest
infancy
to
resist
the
growing
evil
show
your
boy
a
drunkard
wallowing
in
the
streets
like
some
unclean
animal
in
the
mire
every
on
a
will
furnish
you
with
examples
point
out
to
him
the
immorality
of
such
a
degrading
position
make
him
fully
sensible
of
all
its
disgusting
horrors
tell
him
that
god
has
threatened
in
words
of
unmistakable
import
that
he
will
exclude
such
from
his
heavenly
kingdom
convince
him
that
such
loathsome
impurity
must
totally
unfit
the
soul
for
communion
with
its
god
that
such
a
state
may
truly
be
looked
upon
as
the
second
death
the
foul
corruption
and
decay
of
both
body
and
soul
teach
the
child
to
pray
against
drunkenness
as
he
would
against
murder
lying
and
theft
shew
him
that
all
these
crimes
are
often
comprised
in
this
one
which
in
too
many
cases
has
been
the
fruitful
parent
of
them
all
when
the
boy
grows
to
be
a
man
and
mingles
in
the
world
of
men
he
will
not
easily
forget
the
lesson
impressed
on
his
young
heart
he
will
remember
his
early
prayers
against
this
terrible
vice
will
recall
that
disgusting
spectacle
and
will
naturally
shrink
from
the
same
contamination
should
he
be
overcome
by
temptation
the
voice
of
conscience
will
plead
with
him
in
such
decided
tones
that
she
will
be
heard
and
he
will
be
ashamed
of
becoming
the
idiot
thing
he
once
feared
and
loathed
the
drunkard
return
oh
ask
not
of
my
morn
of
life
how
dark
and
dull
it
gloom
me
sharp
words
and
fierce
domestic
strife
robb
my
young
heart
of
all
its
glee
the
sobs
of
one
wife
low
stifled
moans
of
agony
that
fell
upon
my
shrinking
ear
in
hollow
tones
of
woe
and
fear
as
crouching
weeping
at
her
side
i
felt
my
soul
with
sorrow
swell
in
pity
begg
her
not
to
hide
the
cause
of
grief
i
knew
too
well
then
wept
afresh
to
hear
her
pray
that
death
might
take
us
both
away
away
from
whom
alas
what
ill
press
the
warm
from
her
heart
was
she
not
young
and
lovely
still
what
made
the
frequent
start
from
eyes
whose
light
of
love
could
fill
my
inmost
soul
and
bade
me
part
from
noisy
comrades
in
the
street
to
kiss
her
cheek
so
cold
and
pale
to
clasp
her
neck
and
hold
her
hand
and
list
the
tale
of
woes
i
could
not
understand
yet
felt
their
force
as
day
by
day
i
watch
her
fade
from
life
away
and
the
cause
of
all
this
woe
her
mate
the
father
of
her
child
in
dread
i
saw
him
come
and
go
with
many
an
awful
oath
reviled
and
from
harsh
word
and
harsher
blow
in
answer
to
her
pleadings
mild
i
shrank
in
terror
till
i
caught
from
her
meek
eyes
th
unwhisper
thought
it
my
edward
for
thy
mother
sake
he
cares
not
in
his
sullen
mood
if
this
poor
heart
with
anguish
break
that
look
was
felt
and
understood
by
her
young
son
thus
school
to
bear
his
wrongs
to
soothe
her
deep
despair
oh
how
i
loath
him
how
i
his
idiot
laugh
or
demon
frown
his
features
bloated
and
deform
the
jests
with
which
he
sought
to
drown
the
consciousness
of
sin
or
storm
to
put
reproof
or
anger
down
oh
is
a
fearful
thing
to
feel
stern
sullen
hate
the
bosom
steel
one
whom
nature
bids
us
prize
the
first
link
in
her
mystic
chain
which
binds
in
strong
and
tender
ties
the
heart
while
reason
rules
the
brain
and
mingling
love
with
holy
fear
renders
the
parent
doubly
dear
i
can
not
bear
to
think
how
deep
the
hatred
was
i
bore
him
then
but
he
has
slept
his
last
long
sleep
and
i
have
trod
the
haunts
of
men
have
felt
the
tide
of
passion
sweep
through
manhood
fiery
heart
and
when
by
strong
temptation
toss
and
tried
i
thought
how
that
lost
father
died
unwept
unpitied
in
his
sin
then
tears
of
burning
shame
would
rise
and
stern
remorse
awake
within
a
host
of
mental
agonies
he
fell
by
one
dark
vice
defiled
was
i
more
pure
his
erring
child
yes
erring
child
but
to
my
tale
my
mother
loved
that
lost
one
still
from
the
deep
fount
which
could
not
fail
through
changes
dark
from
good
to
ill
her
woman
heart
and
sad
and
pale
she
yielded
to
his
stubborn
will
perchance
she
felt
remonstrance
vain
the
effort
to
resist
gave
pain
but
carefully
she
hid
her
grief
from
him
the
idol
of
her
youth
and
fondly
hoped
against
belief
that
her
deep
love
and
stedfast
truth
would
touch
his
heart
and
win
him
back
from
folly
dark
and
devious
track
vain
hope
the
drunkard
heart
is
hard
as
stone
no
grief
disturbs
his
selfish
sensual
joy
his
wife
may
weep
his
starving
children
groan
and
poverty
with
cruel
gripe
annoy
he
neither
hears
nor
heeds
their
famish
moan
the
glorious
owns
no
base
alloy
surrounded
by
a
low
degraded
train
his
fiendish
laugh
defiance
bids
to
pain
he
hugs
the
cup
more
dear
than
friends
to
him
nor
sees
stern
ruin
from
the
goblet
rise
nor
flames
of
hell
careering
the
brim
the
lava
flood
that
glads
his
bloodshot
eyes
poisons
alike
his
body
and
his
soul
till
reason
lies
in
the
bowl
it
was
a
dark
and
fearful
winter
night
loud
roar
the
tempest
round
our
hovel
home
cold
hungry
wet
and
weary
was
our
plight
and
still
we
listen
for
his
step
to
come
my
poor
sick
mother
was
a
piteous
sight
to
see
her
shrink
and
shiver
as
our
dome
shook
to
the
rattling
blast
and
to
the
door
she
crept
to
look
along
the
bleak
black
moor
he
comes
he
comes
and
quivering
all
with
dread
she
spoke
kind
welcome
to
that
sinful
man
his
sole
reply
supper
give
me
bread
then
with
a
sneer
he
tauntingly
began
to
mock
the
want
that
stared
him
in
the
face
her
bitter
sorrow
and
his
own
disgrace
have
no
money
to
procure
you
food
no
wood
no
coal
to
raise
a
cheerful
fire
the
cup
may
warm
your
frozen
blood
we
die
for
lack
of
that
which
you
desire
she
ceased
erect
one
moment
there
he
stood
the
foam
upon
his
lip
with
fiendish
ire
he
seized
a
knife
which
glitter
in
his
way
and
rush
with
fury
on
his
helpless
prey
then
from
a
dusky
nook
i
fiercely
sprung
the
strength
of
manhood
in
that
single
bound
around
his
bloated
form
i
tightly
clung
and
headlong
brought
the
murderer
to
the
ground
we
fell
his
temples
struck
the
cold
the
blood
gush
forth
he
died
without
a
moan
yes
by
my
hand
he
died
one
frantic
cry
of
mortal
anguish
thrill
my
madden
brain
recalling
sense
and
desperately
i
strove
to
raise
my
fallen
sire
again
and
call
upon
my
mother
but
her
eye
was
closed
alike
to
sorrow
want
and
pain
oh
what
a
night
was
that
when
all
alone
i
watch
my
dead
beside
the
cold
i
thought
myself
a
monster
that
the
deed
to
save
my
mother
was
too
promptly
done
i
could
not
see
her
gentle
bosom
bleed
and
quite
forgot
the
father
in
the
son
for
her
i
mourn
for
her
through
bitter
years
pour
forth
my
soul
in
unavailing
tears
the
world
approved
the
act
but
on
my
soul
there
lay
a
gnawing
consciousness
of
guilt
a
biting
sense
of
crime
beyond
control
by
my
rash
hand
a
father
blood
was
spilt
and
i
abjured
for
aye
the
bowl
this
is
my
tale
of
woe
and
if
thou
wilt
be
warn
by
me
the
sparkling
cup
resign
a
serpent
lurks

free

thoughts
on
education
truth
wisdom
virtue
the
eternal
three
great
moral
agents
of
the
universe
shall
yet
reform
and
beautify
the
world
and
render
it
fit
residence
for
him
in
whom
these
glorious
attributes
combined
to
render
perfect
manhood
one
with
god
there
is
no
calculating
the
immense
benefit
which
the
will
colony
will
derive
from
the
present
liberal
provision
made
for
the
education
of
the
rising
generation
a
few
years
ago
schools
were
so
far
apart
and
the
tuition
of
children
so
expensive
that
none
but
the
very
better
class
could
scrape
money
enough
together
to
send
their
children
to
be
instructed
under
the
present
system
every
idle
ragged
child
in
the
streets
by
washing
his
face
and
hands
and
presenting
himself
to
the
free
school
of
his
ward
can
receive
the
same
benefit
as
the
rest
what
an
inestimable
blessing
is
this
and
how
greatly
will
this
education
of
her
population
tend
to
increase
the
wealth
and
prosperity
of
the
province
it
is
a
certain
means
of
a
calling
out
and
making
available
all
the
talent
in
the
colony
and
as
thanks
be
to
god
genius
never
was
confined
to
any
class
the
poor
will
be
more
benefited
by
this
wise
and
munificent
arrangement
than
the
rich
these
schools
are
supported
by
a
district
tax
which
falls
upon
the
property
of
persons
well
able
to
pay
it
but
avarice
and
bigotry
are
already
at
work
to
endeavour
to
deprive
the
young
of
his
blessing
persons
grumble
at
having
to
pay
this
additional
tax
they
say
if
poor
people
want
their
children
taught
let
them
pay
for
it
their
instruction
has
no
right
to
be
forced
from
our
earnings
what
a
narrow
prejudice
is
this
what
miserable
policy
the
education
of
these
neglected
children
by
making
them
better
citizens
will
in
the
long
run
prove
a
great
protection
both
to
life
and
property
then
the
priests
of
different
persuasions
lift
up
their
voices
because
no
particular
creed
is
allowed
to
be
taught
in
the
seminaries
and
exclaim
the
children
will
be
infidels
these
schools
are
godless
and
immoral
in
the
extreme
yes
children
will
be
taught
to
love
each
other
without
any
such
paltry
distinctions
as
party
and
creed
the
rich
and
the
poor
will
meet
together
to
learn
the
sweet
courtesies
of
a
common
humanity
and
prejudice
and
avarice
and
bigotry
can
not
bear
that
there
is
a
spirit
abroad
in
the
world
and
an
evil
spirit
it
is
which
through
all
ages
has
instigated
the
rich
to
look
down
with
contemptuous
feelings
of
superiority
on
the
humble
occupations
and
inferior
circumstances
of
the
poor
now
that
this
spirit
is
diametrically
opposed
to
the
benevolent
precepts
of
christianity
the
fact
of
our
blessed
lord
performing
his
painful
mission
on
earth
in
no
higher
capacity
than
that
of
a
working
mechanic
ought
sufficiently
to
show
what
divine
benevolence
what
humility
was
displayed
in
this
heroic
act
of
all
the
wonderful
events
in
his
wonderful
history
is
there
one
more
astonishing
than
this
that
heaven
high
majesty
his
court
should
keep
in
a
clay
cottage
by
each
blast
controll
that
glory
self
should
serve
our
hopes
and
fears
and
free
eternity
submit
to
years
what
a
noble
triumph
was
this
over
the
cruel
and
unjust
prejudices
of
mankind
it
might
truly
be
termed
the
divine
philosophy
of
virtue
this
condescension
on
the
part
of
the
great
creator
of
the
universe
ought
to
have
been
sufficient
to
have
rendered
labour
honourable
in
the
minds
of
his
followers
and
we
still
indulge
the
hope
that
the
moral
and
intellectual
improvement
of
mankind
will
one
day
restore
labour
to
her
proper
pedestal
in
the
temple
of
virtue
the
chosen
disciples
of
our
great
master
those
to
whom
he
entrusted
the
precious
code
of
moral
laws
that
was
destined
to
overthrow
the
kingdom
of
satan
and
reform
a
degraded
world
were
poor
uneducated
men
the
most
brilliant
gems
are
often
enclosed
in
the
rudest
incrustations
and
he
who
formed
the
bodies
and
souls
of
men
well
knew
that
the
most
powerful
intellects
are
often
concealed
amidst
the
darkness
and
rubbish
of
uneducated
minds
such
minds
enlightened
and
purified
by
his
spirit
he
sent
forth
to
publish
his
message
of
glad
tidings
through
the
earth
the
want
of
education
and
moral
training
is
the
only
barrier
that
exists
between
the
different
classes
of
men
nature
reason
and
christianity
recognise
no
other
pride
may
say
nay
but
pride
was
always
a
liar
and
a
great
hater
of
the
truth
wealth
in
a
hard
abstract
point
of
view
can
never
make
any
take
away
the
wealth
from
an
ignorant
man
and
he
remains
just
the
same
being
he
was
before
he
possessed
it
and
is
no
way
bettered
from
the
mere
circumstance
of
his
having
once
been
rich
but
let
that
wealth
procure
for
him
the
only
true
and
imperishable
riches
knowledge
and
with
it
the
power
to
do
good
to
himself
and
others
which
is
the
great
end
of
moral
and
religious
training
and
a
mighty
structure
is
raised
which
death
itself
is
unable
to
destroy
the
man
has
indeed
changed
his
nature
and
is
fast
regaining
the
resemblance
he
once
bore
to
his
creator
the
soil
of
man
is
no
rank
sex
or
colour
it
claims
a
distinction
far
above
all
these
and
shall
we
behold
its
glorious
energies
imprisoned
in
the
obscene
den
of
ignorance
and
want
without
making
the
least
effort
to
enlighten
its
hideous
darkness
it
is
painful
to
reflect
upon
the
vast
barren
wilderness
of
human
intellect
which
on
every
side
stretches
around
us
to
know
that
thousands
of
powerful
minds
are
condemned
by
the
hopeless
degradation
of
their
circumstances
to
struggle
on
in
obscurity
without
one
gleam
of
light
what
a
high
and
noble
privilege
has
the
almighty
conferred
upon
the
wealthy
and
portion
of
mankind
in
giving
them
the
means
of
reclaiming
and
cultivating
those
barren
minds
and
of
lifting
them
from
the
mire
of
ignorance
in
which
they
at
present
wallow
to
share
with
them
the
moral
dignity
of
thinking
men
a
small
portion
of
the
wealth
that
is
at
present
bestowed
upon
mere
articles
of
luxury
or
in
scenes
of
riot
and
dissipation
would
more
than
effect
this
great
purpose
the
education
of
the
poorer
classes
must
add
greatly
to
the
and
happiness
of
the
world
and
tend
to
diminish
the
awful
amount
of
crimes
and
misery
which
up
to
the
present
moment
has
rendered
it
a
vale
of
tears
the
ignorance
of
the
masses
must
while
it
remains
for
ever
separate
them
from
their
more
fortunate
brethren
remove
this
stumbling
block
out
of
the
way
and
the
hard
line
of
demarcation
which
now
divides
them
will
soften
and
gradually
melt
away
their
supposed
inferiority
lies
in
their
situation
alone
turn
to
the
history
of
those
great
men
whom
education
has
rescued
from
the
very
lowest
walks
of
life
and
you
will
find
a
mighty
host
who
were
in
their
age
and
day
the
companions
the
advisers
the
friends
of
princes
men
who
have
written
their
names
with
the
pen
and
sword
upon
the
pillars
of
time
and
if
immortality
can
exist
in
a
world
of
constant
change
have
been
rendered
immortal
by
their
words
or
deeds
let
poverty
and
bigotry
do
their
utmost
to
keep
such
spirits
while
living
in
the
shades
of
obscurity
death
the
great
equalizer
always
restores
to
its
possessors
the
rights
of
mind
and
bids
them
triumph
for
ever
over
the
low
prejudices
of
their
who
when
reading
the
works
of
burns
or
gazing
on
the
paintings
of
raphael
reproach
them
with
the
lowliness
of
their
origin
yea
the
proudest
who
have
taste
to
appreciate
their
glorious
creations
rejoice
that
genius
could
thus
triumph
over
temporary
obstacles
it
has
often
been
asserted
by
the
rich
and
that
if
the
poorer
classes
were
as
well
educated
as
themselves
it
would
render
them
familiar
and
presumptuous
and
they
would
no
longer
pay
to
their
superiors
in
station
that
deference
which
must
exist
for
the
of
society
we
view
the
subject
with
far
other
eyes
and
conclude
from
analogy
that
that
which
has
conferred
such
incalculable
benefits
on
the
rich
and
helped
mainly
to
place
them
in
the
position
they
now
hold
could
not
be
detrimental
to
the
poor
the
man
who
knows
his
duty
is
more
likely
to
perform
it
well
than
the
ignorant
man
whose
services
are
compulsory
and
whose
actions
are
influenced
by
the
moral
responsibility
which
a
right
knowledge
must
give
my
earnest
wish
for
universal
education
involves
no
dislike
to
royal
rule
or
for
those
distinctions
of
birth
and
wealth
which
i
consider
necessary
for
the
of
society
it
little
matters
by
what
name
we
call
them
men
of
talent
and
education
will
exert
a
certain
influence
over
the
minds
of
their
which
will
always
be
felt
and
acknowledged
in
the
world
if
mankind
were
equalized
perfect
unadulterated
republicanism
is
a
beautiful
but
fallacious
chimera
which
never
has
existed
upon
the
earth
and
which
if
the
bible
be
true
and
we
have
no
doubts
on
the
subject
we
are
told
never
will
exist
in
heaven
still
we
consider
that
it
would
be
true
wisdom
and
policy
in
those
who
possess
a
large
share
of
the
good
things
of
this
world
to
make
labour
honourable
by
exalting
the
poor
operative
into
an
intelligent
moral
agent
surely
it
is
no
small
privilege
to
be
able
to
bind
up
his
bruised
and
broken
heart
to
wipe
the
dust
from
his
brow
and
the
tears
from
his
eyes
and
bid
him
once
more
stand
erect
in
his
maker
image
this
is
indeed
to
become
the
benefactor
both
of
his
soul
and
body
for
the
mind
once
convinced
of
its
own
real
worth
and
native
dignity
is
less
prone
to
fall
into
low
and
degrading
vices
than
when
struggling
with
ignorance
and
the
galling
chain
of
despised
poverty
it
is
impossible
for
the
most
depraved
votary
of
wealth
and
fashion
to
despise
a
poor
honest
man
there
is
an
aristocracy
of
virtue
as
well
as
of
wealth
and
the
rich
man
who
dares
to
cast
undeserved
contempt
upon
his
poor
but
brother
hears
a
voice
within
him
which
in
tones
which
can
not
be
misunderstood
reproves
him
for
blaspheming
his
maker
image
a
glorious
mission
is
conferred
on
you
who
are
rich
and
nobly
born
which
if
well
and
conscientiously
performed
will
make
the
glad
arch
of
heaven
ring
with
songs
of
joy
nor
deem
that
you
will
be
worse
served
because
your
servant
is
a
religious
well
educated
man
or
that
you
will
be
treated
with
less
respect
and
attention
by
one
who
knows
that
your
station
entitles
you
to
it
than
by
the
rude
ignorant
slave
who
hates
you
in
his
heart
and
performs
his
appointed
services
with
an
envious
discontented
spirit
when
we
consider
that
ignorance
is
the
fruitful
parent
of
crime
we
should
unite
with
heart
and
voice
to
banish
it
from
the
earth
we
should
devote
what
means
we
can
spare
and
the
talents
with
which
god
has
endowed
us
in
furthering
every
national
and
benevolent
institution
set
on
foot
for
this
purpose
and
though
the
progress
of
improvement
may
at
first
appear
slow
this
should
not
discourage
any
one
from
endeavouring
to
effect
a
great
and
noble
purpose
many
months
must
intervene
after
sowing
a
crop
before
the
husbandman
can
expect
to
reap
the
harvest
the
winter
snows
must
cover
the
spring
rains
vivify
and
nourish
and
the
summer
sun
ripen
before
the
autumn
arrives
for
the
ingathering
of
his
labour
and
then
the
increase
after
all
his
toil
and
watching
must
be
with
god
during
the
time
of
our
blessed
lord
sojourn
upon
earth
he
proclaimed
the
harvest
to
be
plenteous
and
the
labourers
few
and
he
instructed
his
disciples
to
pray
to
the
lord
of
the
harvest
to
send
more
labourers
into
the
field
does
it
not
therefore
behove
those
who
live
in
a
more
enlightened
age
when
the
truth
of
the
gospel
which
he
sealed
with
his
blood
has
been
preached
in
almost
every
country
to
pray
the
father
of
spirits
to
proportion
the
labourers
to
the
wants
of
his
people
so
that
christian
kindness
brotherly
love
and
moral
improvement
may
go
hand
in
hand
and
keep
pace
with
increasing
literary
and
scientific
knowledge
a
new
country
like
canada
can
not
value
the
education
of
her
people
too
highly
the
development
of
all
the
talent
within
the
province
will
in
the
end
prove
her
real
worth
for
from
this
source
every
blessing
and
improvement
must
flow
the
greatness
of
a
nation
can
more
truly
be
estimated
by
the
wisdom
and
intelligence
of
her
people
than
by
the
mere
amount
of
specie
she
may
possess
in
her
treasury
the
money
under
the
bad
management
of
ignorant
rulers
would
add
but
little
to
the
of
the
community
while
the
intelligence
which
could
make
a
smaller
sum
available
in
contributing
to
the
general
good
is
in
itself
an
inexhaustible
mine
of
wealth
if
a
few
enlightened
minds
are
able
to
add
so
much
strength
and
importance
to
the
country
to
which
they
belong
how
much
greater
must
that
country
become
if
all
her
people
possessed
this
intelligence
how
impossible
it
would
be
to
conquer
a
country
if
she
could
rely
upon
the
united
wisdom
of
an
educated
people
to
assist
her
in
her
hour
of
need
the
force
of
arms
could
never
subdue
a
nation
thus
held
together
by
the
strong
hands
of
intellectual
fellowship
to
the
wisdom
of
her
educated
men
britain
owes
the
present
position
she
holds
among
the
nations
the
power
of
mind
has
subdued
all
the
natural
obstacles
that
impeded
her
course
and
has
placed
her
above
all
her
competitors
she
did
not
owe
her
greatness
to
extent
of
territory
look
at
the
position
she
occupies
upon
the
map
a
mere
speck
when
compared
with
several
european
nations
it
was
not
to
her
superior
courage
great
as
that
is
acknowledged
to
be
the
french
the
germans
the
spaniards
are
as
brave
as
far
as
mere
courage
is
concerned
are
as
ready
to
attack
and
as
slow
to
yield
as
the
king
himself
no
it
is
to
the
moral
power
of
her
educated
classes
that
she
owes
her
superiority
it
is
more
difficult
to
overcome
mind
than
matter
to
contend
with
the
former
is
to
contend
with
god
himself
for
all
true
knowledge
is
derived
from
him
to
contend
with
the
latter
is
to
fight
with
the
grosser
elements
of
the
earth
which
being
corruptible
in
their
nature
are
more
easily
overcome
from
her
educated
men
have
sprung
all
those
wonderful
discoveries
in
science
which
have
extended
the
commerce
of
great
britain
enlarged
her
capacity
for
usefulness
and
rendered
her
the
general
benefactress
of
mankind
if
education
has
accomplished
these
miracles
for
they
would
have
been
regarded
as
such
in
a
more
remote
period
of
the
world
history
think
of
what
importance
it
is
to
canada
to
bestow
this
inestimable
gift
upon
her
children
yet
i
should
be
sorry
to
see
the
sons
of
the
poor
emigrant
wasting
their
valuable
time
in
acquiring
latin
and
greek
a
man
may
be
highly
educated
may
possess
the
most
lofty
and
comprehensive
mind
without
knowing
one
syllable
of
either
the
best
years
of
a
boy
life
are
often
thrown
away
in
acquiring
the
latin
language
which
often
proves
of
little
use
to
him
in
after
life
and
which
for
the
want
of
practice
becomes
to
him
a
dead
letter
as
well
as
a
dead
language
let
the
boy
be
taught
to
think
to
know
the
meaning
thoroughly
of
what
he
learns
and
by
the
right
use
of
his
reflective
faculties
be
enabled
to
communicate
the
knowledge
thus
acquired
to
others
a
comprehensive
knowledge
of
the
arts
and
sciences
of
history
geography
chemistry
and
mathematics
together
with
a
deep
and
unbigoted
belief
in
the
great
truths
of
christianity
would
render
a
man
or
woman
a
highly
intellectual
and
rational
companion
without
going
beyond
the
pale
of
plain
english
light
give
me
more
light
were
the
dying
words
of
goethe
and
this
should
be
the
constant
prayer
of
all
rational
souls
to
the
father
of
light
more
crimes
are
committed
through
ignorance
than
through
the
influence
of
bad
and
malignant
passions
an
ignorant
man
is
incapable
of
judging
correctly
however
anxious
he
may
be
to
do
so
he
gropes
in
the
dark
like
a
blind
man
and
if
he
should
happen
to
stumble
on
the
right
path
it
is
more
by
accident
than
from
any
correct
idea
which
has
been
formed
in
his
mind
respecting
it
the
mind
which
once
begins
to
feel
a
relish
for
acquiring
knowledge
is
not
easily
satisfied
the
more
it
knows
the
less
it
thinks
of
its
own
acquirements
and
the
more
anxious
it
becomes
to
arrive
at
the
truth
and
finding
that
perfection
is
not
a
growth
of
earth
it
carries
its
earnest
longings
beyond
this
world
and
seeks
it
in
communion
with
the
deity
if
the
young
could
once
be
fully
persuaded
that
there
was
no
disgrace
in
labour
in
honest
honourable
poverty
but
a
deep
and
lasting
disgrace
in
ignorance
and
immorality
their
education
would
be
conducted
on
the
most
enlightened
plan
and
produce
the
most
beneficial
results
the
poor
man
who
could
have
recourse
to
a
book
for
amusement
instead
of
wasting
a
leisure
hour
in
the
barroom
of
a
tavern
would
be
more
likely
to
promote
the
comfort
and
respectability
of
his
family
why
should
the
labourer
be
debarred
from
sharing
with
the
rich
the
great
world
of
the
past
and
be
able
to
rank
amongst
his
best
friends
the
distinguished
men
of
all
creeds
and
countries
and
to
feel
for
these
dead
worthies
who
thanks
to
the
immortal
art
of
printing
still
live
in
their
works
the
warmest
gratitude
and
admiration
the
very
mention
of
some
names
awaken
in
the
mind
the
most
lively
emotion
we
recall
their
beautiful
thoughts
to
memory
and
repeat
them
with
as
much
earnestness
as
though
the
dead
spake
again
through
our
lips
of
all
the
inventions
of
man
there
are
none
to
which
we
are
so
greatly
indebted
as
to
the
art
of
printing
to
it
we
shall
yet
owe
the
emancipation
of
the
larger
portion
of
mankind
from
a
state
of
mental
and
physical
slavery
what
floods
of
light
have
dawned
upon
the
world
since
that
silent
orator
the
press
set
at
liberty
the
imprisoned
thoughts
of
men
and
poured
the
wealth
of
mind
among
the
famishing
sons
of
earth
formerly
few
could
read
because
manuscript
books
the
labours
of
the
pen
were
sold
at
such
an
enormous
price
that
only
men
of
rank
or
great
wealth
could
afford
to
purchase
them
the
peasant
and
the
landholder
who
employed
him
were
alike
ignorant
they
could
not
obtain
books
and
therefore
learning
to
read
might
well
be
considered
in
those
dark
ages
a
waste
of
time
this
profound
ignorance
gave
rise
to
all
those
superstitions
which
in
the
present
enlightened
age
are
regarded
with
such
astonishment
by
thinking
minds
how
could
sensible
good
men
condemn
poor
old
women
to
death
for
being
witches
was
a
question
once
asked
me
by
my
nephew
a
fine
intelligent
boy
of
eight
years
of
age
now
this
boy
had
read
a
good
deal
young
as
he
was
and
thought
more
and
was
wiser
in
his
day
and
generation
than
these
same
pious
bigots
and
why
the
boy
had
read
the
works
of
more
enlightened
men
and
making
a
right
use
of
his
reason
he
felt
convinced
that
these
men
were
in
error
although
he
had
been
born
and
brought
up
in
the
backwoods
of
canada
a
fact
which
the
great
mathew
hale
was
taught
by
bitter
experience
i
have
said
more
on
this
subject
than
i
at
first
intended
but
i
feel
deeply
impressed
with
the
importance
of
it
and
though
i
confess
myself
wholly
inadequate
to
do
it
the
justice
it
deserves
i
hope
the
observations
i
have
made
will
attract
the
attention
of
my
canadian
readers
and
lead
them
to
study
it
more
profoundly
for
themselves
thanks
be
to
god
canada
is
a
free
country
a
land
of
plenty
a
land
exempt
from
pauperism
burdensome
taxation
and
all
the
ills
which
crush
and
finally
sink
in
ruin
older
communities
while
the
vigour
of
young
life
is
yet
hers
and
she
has
before
her
the
experience
of
all
other
nations
it
becomes
an
act
of
duty
and
real
to
give
to
her
children
the
best
education
that
lies
in
her
power

can

potent

whose
mysterious
tones
impart

and
vigour
to
his
heart
is
an
emanation
bright
shooting
from

fount

light

in
upon
the

for

my
dear
reader
before
we
proceed
further
on
our
journey
it
may
be
as
well
to
give
you
some
idea
of
how
the
canadian
people
in
towns
spend
their
time
i
will
endeavour
to
describe
to
you
the
various
sources
from
whence
they
derive
pleasure
and
amusement
in
large
cities
like
montreal
and
toronto
the
higher
classes
are
as
refined
and
intellectual
as
ladies
and
gentlemen
at
home
and
spend
their
lives
much
in
the
same
manner
their
houses
abound
in
all
the
elegancies
and
luxuries
of
life
and
to
step
into
their
you
would
imagine
yourself
still
in
england
they
drive
handsome
carriages
and
ride
fine
spirited
horses
and
if
they
are
encumbered
with
fewer
domestic
pests
in
the
shape
of
pampered
servants
they
have
in
this
respect
a
decided
advantage
over
their
european
friends
they
dress
well
and
expensively
and
are
very
particular
to
have
their
clothes
cut
in
the
newest
fashion
men
and
women
adopt
the
reigning
mode
so
universally
that
they
look
all
dressed
alike
the
moment
a
fashion
becomes
at
all
obsolete
the
articles
of
dress
made
to
suit
it
are
discarded
in
england
a
lady
may
please
herself
in
the
choice
of
colours
and
in
adopting
as
much
of
a
fashion
as
suits
her
style
of
person
and
taste
but
in
canada
they
carry
this
imitation
of
the
fashions
of
the
day
to
extremes
if
green
was
the
prevailing
colour
every
lady
would
adopt
it
whether
it
suited
her
complexion
or
no
and
if
she
was
ever
so
stout
that
circumstance
would
not
prevent
her
from
wearing
more
skirts
than
was
necessary
because
that
absurd
and
unhealthy
practice
has
for
a
long
period
prevailed
music
is
taught
very
generally
though
very
few
attain
any
great
perfection
in
the
science
a
great
many
perform
well
enough
to
gratify
their
friends
and
contribute
to
the
enjoyment
of
a
social
evening
you
will
find
a
piano
in
every
weathy
canadian
house
and
even
in
the
dwellings
of
most
of
the
respectable
mechanics
i
never
met
with
a
canadian
girl
who
could
not
dance
and
dance
well
it
seems
born
in
them
and
it
is
their
favourite
amusement
polkas
waltzes
and
quadrilles
are
the
dances
most
approved
in
their
private
and
public
assemblies
the
eight
scotch
reel
has
however
its
admirers
and
most
parties
end
with
this
lively
romping
dance
balls
given
on
public
days
such
as
the
queen
birthday
and
by
societies
such
as
the
freemasons
the
odd
fellows
and
the
firemen
are
composed
of
very
mixed
company
and
the
highest
and
lowest
are
seen
in
the
same
room
they
generally
contrive
to
keep
to
their
own
set
dancing
alternately
rarely
occupying
the
floor
together
it
is
surprising
the
goodwill
and
harmony
that
presides
in
these
mixed
assemblies
as
long
as
they
are
treated
with
civility
the
lower
classes
shew
no
lack
of
courtesy
to
the
higher
to
be
a
spectator
at
one
of
these
public
balls
is
very
amusing
the
country
girls
carry
themselves
with
such
an
easy
freedom
that
it
is
quite
entertaining
to
look
at
and
listen
to
them
at
a
freemasons
ball
some
years
ago
a
very
amusing
thing
took
place
a
young
handsome
woman
still
in
her
girlhood
had
brought
her
baby
which
she
carried
with
her
into
the
on
being
asked
to
dance
she
was
rather
puzzled
what
to
do
with
the
child
but
seeing
a
young
lawyer
one
of
the
of
the
town
standing
with
folded
arms
looking
on
she
ran
across
the
room
and
putting
the
baby
into
his
arms
exclaimed
you
are
not
dancing
sir
pray
hold
my
baby
for
me
till
the
next
quadrille
is
over
away
she
skipped
back
to
her
partner
and
left
the
gentleman
overwhelmed
with
confusion
while
the
room
shook
with
peals
of
laughter
making
the
best
of
it
he
danced
the
baby
to
the
music
and
kept
it
in
high
good
humour
till
its
mother
returned
i
guess
she
said
that
you
are
a
married
man
yes
said
he
returning
the
child
and
a
mason
well
i
thought
as
much
any
how
by
the
way
you
acted
with
the
baby
my
conduct
was
not
quite
free
from
selfishness
i
expect
a
reward
as
how
that
you
will
give
the
baby
to
your
husband
and
dance
the
next
set
with
me
with
all
my
heart
let
us
go
if
legs
did
not
do
their
duty
it
was
no
fault
of
their
pretty
owner
for
she
danced
with
all
her
strength
greatly
to
the
amusement
of
her
aristocratic
partner
when
we
first
came
to
belleville
evening
parties
commenced
at
the
primitive
and
hour
of
six
but
now
invitations
are
issued
for
eight
the
company
however
seldom
assemble
before
nine
and
those
who
wish
to
be
very
fashionable
do
make
their
appearance
before
ten
this
is
rather
absurd
in
a
country
but
folly
as
well
as
wisdom
is
justified
of
her
children
evening
parties
always
include
dancing
and
music
while
cards
are
provided
for
those
gentlemen
who
prefer
whist
to
the
society
of
the
ladies
the
evening
generally
closes
with
a
splendid
supper
in
which
there
is
no
lack
of
the
good
things
which
the
season
affords
the
ladies
are
always
served
first
the
gentlemen
waiting
upon
them
at
supper
and
they
never
sit
down
to
the
table
when
the
company
is
large
until
after
the
ladies
have
returned
to
the
this
custom
would
not
be
very
agreeable
to
some
english
epicures
but
it
is
an
universal
one
with
canadian
gentlemen
whose
politeness
and
attention
to
the
other
sex
is
one
of
the
most
pleasing
traits
in
their
character
the
opportunities
of
visiting
the
theatre
occur
very
seldom
and
only
can
be
enjoyed
by
those
who
reside
in
the
of
canada
the
young
men
of
the
place
sometimes
get
up
an
amateur
performance
in
which
they
act
the
part
of
both
ladies
and
gentlemen
greatly
to
the
delight
and
amusement
of
their
audience
i
must
say
that
i
have
enjoyed
a
play
in
one
of
these
private
houses
more
than
ever
i
did
at
drury
lane
or
covent
garden
the
lads
act
with
their
whole
hearts
and
i
have
seen
them
shed
real
tears
over
the
sorrows
they
were
called
upon
to
pourtray
they
did
not
feign
they
really
felt
the
part
of
course
there
was
little
artistic
skill
but
a
good
deal
of
truth
and
nature
in
the
summer
riding
and
boating
parties
take
the
place
of
dancing
these
are
always
regular
picnics
each
party
contributing
their
share
of
eatables
and
drinkables
to
the
general
stock
they
commonly
select
some
pretty
island
in
the
bay
or
shady
retired
spot
on
the
main
land
for
the
general
rendezvous
where
they
light
a
fire
boil
their
kettles
and
cook
the
vegetables
to
eat
with
their
cold
prog
which
usually
consists
of
hams
fowls
meat
pies
cold
joints
of
meat
and
abundance
of
tarts
and
cakes
while
the
luxury
of
ice
is
conveyed
in
a
blanket
at
the
bottom
of
one
of
the
boats
these
water
parties
are
very
delightful
the
ladies
stroll
about
and
gather
wild
fruit
and
flowers
while
the
gentlemen
fish
the
weather
at
that
season
of
the
year
is
sure
to
be
fine
and
the
water
scenery
beautiful
in
the
extreme
those
who
possess
good
voices
sing
and
the
young
folks
dance
on
the
greensward
a
day
spent
thus
happily
with
nature
in
her
green
domain
is
one
of
pure
and
innocent
enjoyment
there
is
always
a
reunion
in
the
evening
of
the
party
at
the
house
of
one
of
the
married
ladies
who
were
present
at
the
picnic
in
a
riding
party
some
place
is
selected
in
the
country
and
those
who
are
invited
meet
at
a
fixed
hour
on
the
appointed
ground
the
oakhill
pond
near
the
village
of
rawdon
and
about
sixteen
miles
from
belleville
is
a
very
favourite
spot
and
is
one
of
singular
beauty
this
oakhill
pond
is
a
small
clear
and
very
deep
lake
on
the
summit
of
a
high
hill
it
is
about
two
miles
in
circumference
and
being
almost
circular
must
nearly
be
as
broad
as
it
is
long
the
waters
are
intensely
blue
the
is
filled
up
with
groves
of
dark
pine
while
the
woods
in
front
are
composed
of
the
dwarf
oaks
and
firs
which
are
generally
found
on
these
table
lands
interspersed
with
low
bushes
the
sandy
soil
abounding
with
every
canadian
variety
of
wild
fruits
and
flowers
there
is
an
excellent
plank
road
all
the
way
from
belleville
to
rawdon
the
oakhills
lie
a
little
to
the
left
and
you
approach
them
by
a
very
steep
ascent
from
the
summit
of
which
you
obtain
as
fine
a
prospect
as
i
have
seen
in
this
part
of
canada
a
vast
country
lies
stretched
beneath
your
feet
and
you
look
down
upon
an
immense
forest
whose
moved
by
the
wind
cause
it
to
undulate
like
a
green
ocean
from
this
spot
you
may
trace
the
four
windings
of
the
bay
to
its
junction
with
the
blue
waters
of
the
ontario
the
last
time
i
gazed
from
the
top
of
this
hill
a
was
frowning
over
the
woods
and
the
dense
black
clouds
gave
an
awful
grandeur
to
the
noble
picture
the
village
of
rawdon
lies
on
the
other
side
of
this
table
land
quite
in
a
valley
a
bright
brisk
little
stream
runs
through
it
and
turns
several
large
mills
it
is
a
very
pretty
rural
place
and
is
fast
rising
towards
the
dignity
of
a
town
when
we
first
came
to
belleville
the
spot
on
which
rawdon
now
stands
belonged
principally
if
not
altogether
to
an
enterprising
orkney
man
edward
fidlar
to
whose
energy
and
industry
it
mainly
owes
its
existence
fidlar
might
truly
be
termed
the
father
of
the
village
a
witty
friend
suggested
that
instead
of
rawdon
it
ought
more
properly
to
be
called
fidlar
green
there
is
a
clean
country
inn
just
at
the
foot
of
the
long
hill
leading
to
the
oakhill
pond
kept
by
a
respectable
of
the
name
of
fairman
if
the
party
does
not
wish
to
be
troubled
with
carrying
baskets
of
provisions
so
far
they
send
word
to
fairman
the
day
previous
to
prepare
dinner
for
so
many
guests
this
she
always
does
in
the
best
possible
country
style
at
the
moderate
charge
of
per
head
a
dinner
in
the
country
in
canada
taken
at
the
house
of
some
substantial
yeoman
is
a
very
different
affair
from
a
dinner
in
the
town
the
table
literally
groans
with
good
cheer
and
you
can
not
offer
a
greater
affront
to
your
hostess
than
to
eat
sparingly
of
the
dainties
set
before
you
they
like
to
have
several
days
warning
of
your
intended
visit
that
they
may
go
to
trouble
as
they
most
truly
term
making
such
magnificent
preparations
for
a
few
guests
i
have
sat
down
to
a
table
of
this
kind
in
the
country
with
only
and
myself
as
guests
and
we
have
been
served
with
a
dinner
that
would
have
amply
fed
twenty
people
fowls
of
several
sorts
ham
and
joints
of
roast
and
boiled
meat
besides
quantities
of
pies
puddings
custards
and
cakes
cheese
is
invariably
offered
to
you
with
apple
pie
and
several
little
glass
dishes
are
ranged
round
your
plate
for
preserves
honey
and
apple
sauce
which
latter
dainty
is
never
wanting
at
a
country
feast
the
mistress
of
the
house
constantly
presses
you
to
partake
of
all
these
things
and
sometimes
the
accumulation
of
rich
food
on
one
plate
which
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
consume
is
everything
but
agreeable
two
ladies
friends
of
mine
went
to
spend
the
day
at
one
of
these
too
hospitable
entertainers
the
weather
was
intensely
hot
they
had
driven
a
long
way
in
the
sun
and
both
ladies
had
a
headache
and
very
little
appetite
in
consequence
the
mistress
of
the
house
went
to
trouble
and
prepared
a
great
feast
for
her
guests
but
finding
that
they
partook
very
sparingly
of
her
good
cheer
her
pride
was
greatly
hurt
and
rising
suddenly
from
her
seat
and
turning
to
them
with
a
stern
brow
she
exclaimed
i
should
like
to
know
what
ails
my
victuals
that
you
do
choose
to
eat
the
poor
ladies
explained
the
reason
of
their
appetites
having
failed
them
but
they
found
it
a
difficult
matter
to
soothe
their
irritated
hostess
who
declared
that
she
would
never
go
to
trouble
for
them
again
it
is
of
no
use
arguing
against
this
amiable
weakness
for
as
eating
to
uneducated
people
is
one
of
the
greatest
enjoyments
of
life
they
can
not
imagine
how
they
could
make
you
more
comfortable
by
offering
you
less
food
and
of
a
more
simple
kind
large
farmers
in
an
old
cleared
country
live
remarkably
well
and
enjoy
within
themselves
all
the
substantial
comforts
of
life
many
of
them
keep
carriages
and
drive
splendid
horses
the
contrast
between
the
pork
and
potato
diet
and
sometimes
of
potatoes
alone
without
the
pork
in
the
backwoods
is
really
striking
before
a
gentleman
from
the
old
country
concludes
to
settle
in
the
bush
let
him
first
visit
these
comfortable
abodes
of
peace
and
plenty
the
hon
b
when
canvassing
the
county
paid
a
round
of
visits
to
his
principal
political
supporters
and
they
literally
almost
killed
him
with
kindness
every
house
provided
a
feast
in
honour
of
their
distinguished
guest
and
he
was
obliged
to
eat
at
all
coming
to
spend
a
quiet
evening
at
our
house
the
first
words
he
uttered
were
if
you
have
any
regard
for
me
m
pray
do
ask
me
to
eat
i
am
sick
of
the
sight
of
food
i
can
well
imagine
the
amount
of
trouble
each
good
wife
had
taken
upon
herself
on
this
great
occasion
one
of
the
most
popular
public
exhibitions
is
the
circus
a
sort
of
travelling
astley
theatre
which
belongs
to
a
company
in
new
york
this
show
visits
all
the
large
towns
once
during
the
summer
season
the
performances
consists
of
feats
of
horsemanship
gymnastics
dancing
on
the
tight
and
slack
rope
and
wonderful
feats
of
agility
and
strength
and
to
those
who
have
taste
and
nerve
enough
to
admire
such
sights
it
possesses
great
attractions
the
company
is
a
large
one
often
exceeding
forty
persons
it
is
provided
with
good
performers
and
an
excellent
brass
band
the
arrival
of
the
circus
is
commonly
announced
several
weeks
before
it
makes
its
actual
entree
in
the
public
papers
and
large
handbills
are
posted
up
in
the
taverns
containing
coarse
woodcuts
of
the
most
exciting
scenes
in
the
performance
these
ugly
pictures
draw
round
them
crowds
of
little
boys
who
know
the
whole
of
the
programme
by
heart
long
before
the
caravans
containing
the
tents
and
scenery
arrive
hundreds
of
these
little
chaps
are
up
before
on
the
expected
morning
of
the
show
and
walk
out
to
shannonville
a
distance
of
nine
miles
to
meet
it
however
the
farmers
may
grumble
over
bad
times
and
low
prices
the
circus
never
lacks
its
quantum
of
visitors
and
there
are
plenty
of
to
be
had
to
pay
for
tickets
for
themselves
and
their
families
the
indians
are
particularly
fond
of
this
exhibition
and
the
town
is
always
full
of
them
the
day
the
circus
comes
in
a
large
tent
is
pitched
on
the
open
space
between
the
scotch
church
and
the
old
hospital
big
enough
to
contain
at
least
a
thousand
people
besides
a
wide
area
for
the
performance
and
the
pit
an
amphitheatre
of
seats
rise
tier
above
tier
to
within
a
few
feet
of
the
eaves
of
the
tent
for
the
accommodation
of
the
spectators
and
the
whole
space
is
lighted
by
a
large
chandelier
composed
of
tin
holders
filled
with
very
bad
greasy
tallow
candles
that
in
the
close
crowded
place
emit
a
very
disagreeable
odour
the
show
of
horses
and
feats
of
horsemanship
are
always
well
worth
seeing
but
the
rest
grows
very
tiresome
on
frequent
repetition
persons
must
be
very
fond
of
this
sort
of
thing
who
can
twice
visit
the
circus
as
year
after
year
the
clown
repeats
the
same
stale
jests
and
shows
up
the
same
style
of
performers
the
last
time
i
went
in
order
to
please
my
youngest
son
i
was
more
amused
by
the
antics
of
a
man
who
carried
about
and
lemonade
than
by
any
of
the
actors
whenever
he
offered
his
tray
of
sweets
to
the
ladies
it
was
with
such
an
affectedly
graceful
bend
and
throwing
into
his
voice
the
utmost
persuasion
he
contrived
to
glance
down
on
the
with
half
an
eye
and
to
gaze
up
at
the
ladies
he
addressed
with
all
that
remained
of
the
powers
of
vision
exclaiming
with
his
hand
on
his
heart
how
sweet
they
combining
a
recommendation
of
his
with
a
compliment
to
the
fair
sex
the
show
opens
at
two
and
again
at
seven
in
the
evening
the
people
from
a
distance
and
the
young
children
visit
the
exciting
scene
during
the
day
the
at
night
as
it
is
less
crowded
cooler
and
the
company
more
select
persons
of
all
ranks
are
there
and
the
variety
of
faces
and
characters
that
nature
exhibits
gratis
are
far
more
amusing
to
watch
than
the
feats
of
the
athletes
then
there
is
barnham
travelling
menagerie
of
wild
animals
and
of
tame
darkie
melodists
who
occupy
a
tent
by
themselves
and
a
whom
the
boys
look
upon
with
the
same
wonder
they
would
do
at
a
white
rat
or
mouse
everybody
goes
to
see
the
wild
beasts
and
to
poke
fun
at
the
elephants
one
man
who
born
and
brought
up
in
the
backwoods
had
never
seen
an
elephant
before
nor
even
a
picture
of
one
ran
half
frightened
home
to
his
master
exclaiming
as
he
bolted
into
the
room
oh
sir
sir
you
must
let
the
childer
go
to
the
munjery
shure
six
huge
critters
to
be
seen
with
no
eyes
and
a
tail
before
and
behind
the
celebrated
general
tom
thumb
paid
the
town
a
visit
last
summer
his
presence
was
hailed
with
enthusiastic
delight
and
people
crowded
from
the
most
remote
settlements
to
gaze
upon
the
tiny
man
one
poor
irishwoman
insisted
that
he
was
not
a
human
crathur
but
a
poor
fairy
changeling
and
that
he
would
vanish
away
some
day
and
never
be
heard
of
again
signor
blitz
the
great
conjuror
occasionally
pays
us
a
visit
but
his
visits
are
like
angel
visits
few
and
far
between
his
performance
never
fails
in
filling
the
large
room
in
the
for
several
successive
nights
and
his
own
purse
then
we
have
lecturers
from
the
united
states
on
all
subjects
who
commonly
content
themselves
with
hiring
the
room
belonging
to
the
mechanics
institute
where
they
hold
forth
for
the
moderate
sum
of
a
york
shilling
a
head
on
mesmerism
phrenology
biology
phonography
spiritual
communications
etc
these
wandering
lectures
are
often
very
well
attended
and
their
performance
is
highly
entertaining
imagine
a
tall
thin
bearded
american
exhibiting
himself
at
a
small
wooden
desk
between
two
dingy
tallow
candles
and
holding
forth
in
the
genuine
nasal
twang
on
these
sciences
on
which
so
much
is
advanced
and
of
which
so
little
is
at
present
understood
our
lecturer
however
expresses
no
doubts
upon
the
subject
of
which
he
treats
he
proves
on
the
persons
of
his
audience
the
truth
of
phrenology
biology
and
mesmerism
and
the
individuals
he
pitches
upon
to
illustrate
his
facts
perform
their
parts
remarkably
well
and
often
leave
the
spectators
in
a
maze
of
doubt
astonishment
and
admiration
i
remember
about
three
years
ago
going
with
my
husband
to
hear
the
lecturers
of
a
person
who
called
himself
professor
r
he
had
been
lecturing
for
some
nights
running
at
the
mechanics
institute
for
nothing
and
had
drawn
together
a
great
number
of
persons
to
hear
him
and
witness
the
strange
things
he
effected
by
mesmerism
on
the
persons
of
such
of
the
audience
who
wished
to
test
his
skill
this
would
have
been
but
a
poor
way
of
getting
his
living
but
these
american
adventurers
never
give
their
time
and
labour
for
nothing
he
obtained
two
dollars
for
examining
a
head
phrenologically
and
drawing
out
a
chart
and
as
his
lectures
seldom
closed
without
securing
him
a
great
many
heads
for
inspection
our
disinterested
professor
contrived
to
pocket
a
great
deal
of
money
and
to
find
his
cheap
lectures
an
uncommonly
profitable
speculation
we
had
heard
a
great
deal
of
his
curing
a
blacksmith
of
by
mesmerizing
him
the
blacksmith
though
a
big
burly
man
had
turned
out
an
admirable
clairvoyant
and
by
touching
particular
bumps
in
his
cranium
the
professor
could
make
him
sing
dance
and
fight
all
in
a
breath
or
transport
him
to
california
and
set
him
to
picking
gold
i
was
very
curious
to
witness
this
man
conduct
under
his
alleged
mesmeric
state
and
went
accordingly
after
a
long
lecture
during
which
the
professor
put
into
a
deep
sleep
a
kentuckian
giant
who
travelled
with
him
the
blacksmith
was
called
upon
to
satisfy
the
curiosity
of
the
spectators
i
happened
to
sit
near
this
individual
and
as
he
rose
to
comply
with
the
vociferous
demands
of
the
audience
i
shall
never
forget
the
sidelong
knowing
glance
he
cast
across
the
bench
to
a
friend
of
his
own
it
was
without
exception
the
most
intelligent
telegraphic
despatch
that
it
was
possible
for
one
human
eye
to
convey
to
another
and
said
more
plainly
than
words
could
you
shall
see
how
i
can
humbug
them
all
that
look
opened
my
eyes
completely
to
the
farce
that
was
acting
before
me
and
entering
into
the
spirit
of
the
scene
i
must
own
that
i
enjoyed
it
amazingly
the
blacksmith
was
mesmerised
by
a
alone
and
for
half
an
hour
went
on
in
a
most
funny
manner
keeping
the
spectators
with
their
eyes
open
and
in
convulsions
of
laughter
after
a
while
the
professor
left
him
to
enjoy
his
mesmeric
nap
and
chose
another
subject
in
the
person
of
a
man
who
had
lectured
a
few
nights
before
on
the
science
of
mnemonics
and
had
been
disappointed
in
a
very
scanty
attendance
after
a
decent
time
had
elapsed
the
new
subject
yielded
very
easily
to
the
professor
magic
passes
and
fell
into
a
profound
sleep
the
mesmerizer
then
led
him
with
his
eyes
shut
to
the
front
of
the
stage
and
pointed
out
to
the
spectators
the
phrenological
development
of
his
head
he
then
touched
the
bump
of
language
and
set
the
seeming
automaton
talking
but
here
the
professor
was
caught
in
his
own
trap
after
once
setting
him
going
he
of
the
mnemonics
refused
to
hold
his
tongue
until
he
had
given
to
his
weary
listeners
the
whole
lecture
he
had
delivered
a
few
nights
before
he
pranced
to
and
fro
on
the
platform
declaiming
in
the
most
pedantic
voice
and
kept
us
for
one
blessed
hour
before
he
would
suffer
the
professor
to
deprive
him
of
the
unexpected
opportunity
thus
afforded
him
of
being
heard
it
was
a
droll
scene
the
sly
blacksmith
in
a
profound
fox
sleep
the
declaimer
pretending
to
be
asleep
and
wide
awake
all
the
time
and
the
thin
american
too
wise
to
betray
his
colleagues
but
evidently
annoyed
beyond
measure
at
the
trick
they
had
played
him
i
once
went
to
hear
a
lecture
at
the
mechanics
institute
delivered
by
a
very
eccentric
person
who
styled
himself
the
hon
james
spencer
lidstone
great
orator
of
the
my
astonishment
may
be
guessed
better
than
described
when
he
gave
out
for
the
subject
of
his
lecture
great
women
from
eve
down
to
mrs
m
not
wishing
to
make
myself
a
to
a
pretty
numerous
audience
i
left
the
room
going
up
the
street
next
morning
a
venerable
old
man
ran
after
me
and
pulling
me
by
the
shawl
said
m
why
did
you
leave
us
last
night
he
did
you
justice
indeed
he
did
you
should
have
stayed
and
heard
all
the
fine
things
he
said
of
you
besides
scientific
lecturers
canada
is
visited
by
singers
and
musicians
of
every
country
and
of
every
age
and
sex
from
the
celebrated
jenny
lind
and
the
once
celebrated
braham
down
to
pretenders
who
can
neither
sing
nor
play
worth
paying
a
york
shilling
to
hear
some
of
these
wandering
musicians
play
with
considerable
skill
and
are
persons
of
talent
their
life
is
one
of
strange
vicissitudes
and
adventure
and
they
have
an
opportunity
of
making
the
acquaintance
of
many
odd
characters
in
illustration
of
this
i
will
give
you
a
few
of
the
trials
of
a
travelling
musician
which
i
took
down
from
the
dictation
of
a
young
friend
since
dead
who
earned
a
precarious
living
by
his
profession
he
had
the
faculty
of
telling
his
adventures
without
the
power
of
committing
them
to
paper
and
from
the
simplicity
and
truthfulness
of
his
character
i
have
no
doubt
of
the
variety
of
all
the
amusing
anecdotes
he
told
but
he
shall
speak
for
himself
in
the
next
chapter
a
carol
there
not
a
little
bird
that
wings
its
airy
flight

so
blithe

i
love
the
fields
the
budding

gushing

bathe
my

me

rich
and
rare

meekly
through
her
sheltering

the
violet
nestles
there
the
violet
oh
what
tales
of
love
of
youth
sweet
spring
are
thine
and
lovers
still
in
field
and
grove
of
thee
will
chaplets
twine

are
the
treasures
nature
strews
with
lavish

around
my
precious
gems

sparkling
dews
my
wealth
the
verdant

are
the
songs
that
freely
gush
from
hedge
and
bush
and
tree
the
soaring
lark
and
speckled
thrush
discourse
rich
melody
a
cloud
comes
floating
the
sun
the
woods
green
glories
fade
but
hark
the
blackbird
has
begun
his
wild
lay
in
the
shade
he
hails
with
joy
the

shower
and
plumes
his
glossy
wing
while
pattering
on
his
leafy
bower
i
hear
the
big
drops
ring
slowly
at
first
but
quicker
now
the
rushing
rain
descends
and
to
each
spray
and
leafy
bough
a
crown
of
diamonds
lends
oh
what
a
splendid
sight
appears
the
sun
bursts
forth
again
and
smiling
through
sweet
nature
tears
lights
up
the
hill
and
plain
and
tears
are
trembling
in
my
eyes
tears
of
intense
delight
whilst
gazing
upward
to
the
skies
my
heart
my
sight
great
god
of
nature
may
thy
grace
pervade
my
inmost
soul
and
in
her
beauties
may
i
trace
the
love
that
form
the
whole
chapter
v
trials
of
a
travelling
musician
the
man
that
hath
not
music
in
his
soul
i
will
say
no
more
the
quotation
though
but
too
true
i
is
too
well
known
but
it
will
serve
as
the
best
illustration
i
can
give
to
the
various
annoyances
which
beset
the
path
of
him
who
is
musically
inclined
and
whose
soul
is
in
unison
with
sweet
sounds
this
was
my
case
i
loved
music
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
and
in
order
to
give
myself
wholly
up
to
my
passion
and
claim
a
sort
of
moral
right
to
enjoy
it
i
made
it
a
profession
few
people
have
a
better
opportunity
of
becoming
acquainted
with
the
world
than
the
travelling
musician
yet
such
is
the
absorbing
nature
of
his
calling
that
few
make
use
of
it
less
his
nature
is
open
easy
and
unsuspecting
pleased
with
his
profession
he
hopes
always
to
convey
the
same
pleasure
to
his
hearers
and
though
doubts
will
sometimes
cross
his
mind
and
the
fear
of
ridicule
make
him
awkward
and
nervous
yet
upon
the
whole
he
is
generally
sure
of
making
a
favourable
impression
on
the
and
generous
among
his
hearers
the
musician
moves
among
his
as
a
sort
of
privileged
person
for
who
ever
suspects
him
of
being
a
rogue
his
first
attempt
to
deceive
would
defeat
its
own
object
and
prove
him
to
be
a
mere
pretender
his
hand
and
voice
must
answer
for
his
skill
and
form
the
only
true
test
of
his
abilities
if
tuneless
and
bad
the
public
will
not
fail
to
condemn
him
the
adventures
of
the
troubadours
of
old
if
they
were
more
full
of
sentiment
and
romance
than
the
occurrences
that
beset
the
path
of
the
modern
minstrel
were
not
more
replete
with
odd
chances
and
ludicrous
incident
take
the
following
for
an
example
of
the
many
droll
things
which
have
happened
to
me
during
my
travels
in
the
summer
of
i
was
making
a
professional
tour
through
the
united
states
and
had
advertised
a
concert
for
the
ensuing
evening
at
the
small
town
of
and
was
busy
making
the
necessary
arrangements
when
i
was
suddenly
accosted
as
i
left
the
hotel
by
a
tall
thin
looking
man
of
a
most
unmusical
and
unprepossessing
appearance
i
highly
tickled
to
see
you
i
you
are
going
to
give
an
extra
sing
here
ai
you
yes
i
intend
giving
a
concert
here
this
evening
hem
how
much
dew
you
ax
to
come
in
that
is
i
want
to
say
what
are
you
goin
to
chearge
a
ticket
half
a
dollar
the
usual
price
how
inclining
his
ear
towards
me
as
if
he
doubted
the
soundness
of
the
organ
half
a
dollar
repeated
i
carelessly
tis
tew
much
you
had
better
chearge
cents
if
you
dew
you
have
a
pretty
good
house
if
you
make
it
twelve
and
a
half
cents
you

a
if
mister
you
lower

agin
to
six
and
a
quarter
cents
you
have
to
take
a
field
there
ai
a
house
would
hold
after
a
pause
scratching
his
head
and
shuffling
with
his
feet
i
you
ginnerally
give
the
profession
tickets
sometimes
i
a
in
your
line
myself
although
i
a
by
trade
i
leads
the
first
presbyterian
choir
upon
the
hill
i
should
like
to
have
you
come
up
if
you
stay
long
enough
as
that
is
the
case
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
if
i
am
likely
to
have
a
good
house
i
kind
a
reckon
as
how
you
will
that
is
if
you
do
chearge
tew
much
where
shall
i
get
the
best
room
well
i
guess
you
had
better
try
the
old
meetin
house
thank
you
allow
me
sir
to
present
you
with
a
ticket
i
now
thought
that
i
had
got
rid
of
him
and
amply
paid
him
for
the
information
i
had
received
the
ticket
was
for
a
single
admission
he
took
it
turned
it
slowly
round
held
it
close
to
his
eyes
spelt
it
carefully
over
and
then
stared
at
me
what
next
thought
i
there
my
wife
well
i
she
like
to
come
in
you
wish
me
to
give
you
a
double
ticket
i
do
care
if
you
dew
again
turning
the
new
ticket
in
his
hand
and
scratching
his
head
more
earnestly
he
said
i
one
of
the
smartest
boys
you
ever
seed
he
a
ear
for
music
he
can
whistle
any
tune
he
hears
right
straight
off
then
there
my
sister
with
us
jist
now
she
very
fond
of
music
tew
perhaps
said
i
losing
all
patience
you
would
prefer
a
family
ticket
well
i
be
obliged
it
do
cost
you
any
mister
and
if
we
use
it
i
return
it
the
stranger
left
me
and
i
saw
no
more
of
him
until
i
spied
him
in
the
with
a
small
family
of
ten
or
twelve
presently
another
man
and
a
dog
arrived
says
he
to
the
doorkeeper
what
on
here
it
a
concert
admission
i
not
to
give
to
go
in
here
i
hire
a
pew
in
this
here
church
by
the
year
and
i
a
right
to
go
in
whenever
the
door
open
so
in
he
went
with
his
dog
the
evening
turned
out
very
wet
and
these
people
happened
to
form
all
my
audience
and
as
i
did
not
feel
at
all
inclined
to
sing
for
their
especial
benefit
i
returned
to
my
lodgings
i
learned
from
my
doorkeeper
the
next
morning
that
my
friends
waited
for
an
hour
and
a
half
for
my
reappearance
which
could
not
reasonably
have
been
expected
under
existing
circumstances
i
thought
i
had
got
rid
of
the
musical
shoemaker
for
ever
but
no
such
good
luck
before
i
was
out
of
my
bed
he
paid
me
a
visit
you
will
excuse
my
calling
so
early
says
he
but
i
was
anxious
to
see
you
before
you
left
the
town
wishing
him
at
the
bottom
of
the
mississippi
i
put
on
my
dressing
gown
and
slipped
from
my
bed
whilst
he
continued
his
introductory
address
i
was
very
sorry
that
you
had
not
a
better
attendance
last
night
and
i
that
accounted
for
your
leaving
us
as
you
did
we
were
all
kinder
disappointed
you
have
had
a
better
house
only
the
people
thought
there
was
a
humbug
about
this
and
he
handed
me
one
of
my
programmes
it
is
well
known
to
most
of
my
readers
that
in
writing
these
bills
the
name
of
the
composer
generally
follows
the
song
particularly
in
any
very
popular
compositions
such
as
grand
introduction
to
pianoforte
henry
hertz
life
on
the
ocean
wave
henry
russell
old
english
gentleman
melody
by
mart
luther
humbug
said
i
attempting
to
take
the
bill
in
order
to
see
that
no
mistake
had
originated
in
the
printing
but
my
tormentor
held
it
fast
look
said
he
now
where
is
henry
hertz
and
henry
russell
where
is
he
and
the
old
english
gentleman
martin
luther
what
has
become
of
him
the
folks
said
that
he
was
dead
but
i
did
believe
that
for
i
did
think
that
you
would
have
had
the
face
to
put
his
name
in
your
bill
if
he
was
thus
ended
my
acquaintance
with
the
enlightened
shoemaker
of
the
mississippi
i
was
travelling
in
one
of
the
western
canal
boats
the
same
summer
and
was
sauntering
to
and
fro
upon
the
deck
admiring
the
beauty
of
the
country
through
which
we
were
passing
when
i
observed
a
very
tall
sharp
looking
man
regarding
me
with
very
fixed
attention
not
knowing
who
or
what
he
was
i
was
at
last
a
little
annoyed
by
the
pertinacity
of
this
steady
stare
it
was
evident
that
he
meditated
an
attack
upon
me
in
some
shape
or
other
suddenly
he
came
up
to
me
and
extending
his
hand
exclaimed
why
mister
h
is
this
you
i
have
not
seen
you
since
you
gave
your
at
n
it
seems
a
tarnation
long
while
ago
i
thought
perhaps
you
had
got
blowed
up
in
one
of
those
exploded
but
here
you
are
as
large
as
life
and
that
not
over
large
neither
glancing
at
the
slight
dimensions
of
my
figure
and
as
ready
to
raise
the
wind
as
ever
i
am
highly
gratified
to
meet
with
you
as
i
have
one
of
the
greatest
songs
you
ever
to
show
you
if
you
can
but
set
it
to
music
and
sing
it
in
new
york
city
it
will
immortalize
you
and
immortalize
me
tew
amused
at
the
earnestness
with
which
the
fellow
spoke
i
inquired
the
subject
of
his
song
oh
is
is
it
will
make
a
sensation
all
over
the
union
but
what
is
it
about
have
you
got
it
with
you
no
no
mister
i
never
puts
these
things
down
on
paper
lest
other
folk
should
find
them
and
steal
them
but
i
give
you
some
of
what
it
is
look
you
mister
i
was
going
from
syracuse
to
rochester
on
the
we
met
on
our
way
a
storm
the
wind
blew
and
the
rain
came
down
like
old
sixty
and
everything
looked
as
black
as
my
hat
and
the
passengers
got
scared
and
wanted
to
get
off
but
the
captain
sung
out
let
go
jem
and
away
we
went
at
the
rate
of
tew
miles
an
hour
and
they
could
not
stop
by
and
by
we
struck
a
rock
and
down
we
went
indeed
said
i
that
very
unusual
in
a
were
any
lives
lost
no
but
we
were
all
dreadfully
sceared
and
covered
with
mud
i
sat
down
by
the
till
i
got
dry
and
then
i
wrote
my
pome
i
will
repeat
what
i
can
to
you
and
what
i
ca
i
will
write
right
off
when
i
gets
hold
on
hold
on
he
continued
beating
his
forehead
with
the
back
of
his
hand
as
if
to
awaken
the
powers
of
memory
i
have
it
now
i
have
it
now
is
oh
lord
who
the
wants
of
men
guide
my
hand
and
guide
my
pen
and
help
me
bring
the
truth
to
light
of
that
dread
scene
and
awful
night
ri
tu
ri
tu
ri
tu
there
was
mister
cadoga
in
years
was
found
next
morning
in
tew
feet
mud
he
strove
he
strove
but
all
in
vain
the
more
he
got
up
he
fell
down
again
ri
tu
ri
tu
ri
tu
the
poet
paused
for
a
moment
to
gain
breath
evidently
overcome
by
the
recollection
of
the
awful
scene
is
not
that
he
exclaimed
what
a
fine
effect
you
could
give
to
that
on
the
humouring
the
keys
to
imitate
his
squabbling
about
in
the
mud
let
me
tell
you
mister
it
would
beat
russell
on
fire
all
hollow
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
face
he
recommenced
the
passengers
rushed
unto
the
spot
together
with
the
crew
we
got
him
safe
out
of
the
mud
but
he
had
lost
his
shoe
ri
tu
ri
tu
ri
tu
i
could
not
listen
to
another
line
of
this
sublime
effusion
the
passengers
who
had
gathered
around
us
drowning
his
nasal
drawl
in
a
complete
roar
of
laughter
seeing
that
i
was
as
much
infected
as
the
rest
the
poet
turned
to
me
with
an
air
of
offended
dignity
i
do
take
the
trouble
mister
to
repeat
any
more
of
my
to
you
nor
do
i
take
it
kind
at
all
your
laughing
at
me
in
that
ere
way
but
the
truth
is
you
ca
comprehend
nor
appreciate
anything
that
is
sublime
or
out
of
the
common
way
besides
i
do
think
you
could
set
it
to
music
it
is
not
in
you
and
you
ca
fix
it
this
singular
address
renewed
our
mirth
and
finding
myself
unable
to
control
my
inclination
to
laugh
and
not
wishing
to
hurt
his
feelings
i
was
about
to
leave
him
when
the
man
at
the
helm
sung
out
bridge
the
passengers
lowered
their
heads
to
ensure
their
safety
all
but
my
friend
the
poet
who
was
too
much
excited
to
notice
the
signal
before
he
came
in
contact
with
the
bridge
which
sent
him
sprawling
down
the
gangway
he
picked
himself
up
clambered
up
the
stairs
and
began
striding
up
and
down
the
deck
at
a
tremendous
rate
casting
from
time
to
time
indignant
glances
at
me
i
thought
for
my
part
that
the
man
was
not
in
his
right
senses
or
that
the
blow
he
had
received
had
so
dulled
his
bump
of
caution
that
he
could
no
longer
take
care
of
himself
for
the
next
moment
he
stumbled
over
a
little
child
and
would
have
been
hurt
severely
if
i
had
not
broken
his
fall
by
catching
his
arm
before
he
again
measured
his
length
on
the
deck
my
timely
assistance
mollified
his
anger
and
he
once
more
became
friendly
and
confidential
here
take
this
piece
of
poetry
mister
h
and
see
if
you
can
set
to
music
mind
you
it
is
none
of
mine
but
though
not
so
good
it
is
in
my
style
i
cut
it
out
of
a
newspaper
down
east
you
are
welcome
to
it
he
continued
with
a
patronizing
nod
that
is
if
you
are
able
to
do
justice
to
the
subject
i
took
the
piece
of
dirty
crumpled
newspaper
from
his
hand
and
struck
with
the
droll
quizzing
humour
of
the
lines
i
have
preserved
them
ever
since
as
i
have
never
seen
them
before
or
since
i
will
give
you
them
here
to
the
falls
of
niagara
i
wonder
how
long
you
been
at
this
infernal
rate
i
wonder
if
all
you
been
could
be
cipher
on
a
slate
i
wonder
how
such
a
thunderin
sounded
when
all
new
york
was
woods
likely
some
injins
have
been
drownded
when
the
rains
have
raised
your
floods
i
wonder
if
wild
stags
and
buffaloes
have
stood
where
now
i
stand
well
being
scared
at
first
they
stubb
their
toes
i
wonder
where
they
land
i
wonder
if
that
rainbow
has
been
since
at
creation
and
this
waterfall
been
with
constant
spatteration
that
moses
never
mention
ye
i
wonder
while
other
things
describin
my
conscience
how
ye
must
have
foam
and
when
the
deluge
was
subsidin
my
thoughts
are
strange
magnificent
and
deep
when
i
look
down
on
thee
oh
what
a
glorious
place
for
washing
sheep
niagara
would
be
and
oh
what
a
tremendous
water
power
is
wash
over
its
edge
one
man
might
furnish
all
the
world
with
flour
with
a
single
privilege
i
wonder
how
many
times
the
lakes
have
all
been
emptied
over
here
why
clinton
did
not
feed
the
grand
canal
up
here
i
think
is
queer
the
thoughts
are
very
strange
that
crowd
my
brain
when
i
look
up
to
thee
such
thoughts
i
never
expect
to
have
again
to
all
eternity
after
reading
the
lines
i
begged
my
friend
to
excuse
me
as
i
wanted
to
go
below
and
take
a
nap
i
had
not
been
long
in
the
cabin
before
he
followed
me
to
get
rid
of
him
i
pretended
to
be
asleep
after
passing
me
two
or
three
times
and
leaning
over
me
in
the
most
inquisitive
manner
until
his
long
nose
nearly
went
into
my
eye
and
humming
a
tune
in
my
ear
to
ascertain
if
i
were
really
napping
he
turned
from
me
with
a
dissatisfied
grunt
flung
himself
into
a
settee
and
not
long
after
was
puffing
and
blowing
like
a
porpoise
i
was
glad
of
this
opportunity
to
go
on
deck
again
and
i
left
him
alone
in
his
glory
but
while
i
was
congratulating
myself
on
my
good
fortune
i
found
him
once
more
at
my
side
good
heavens
how
i
wished
him
at
the
bottom
of
the
canal
when
he
commenced
telling
me
some
dream
he
had
had
i
was
too
much
annoyed
at
being
pestered
with
his
company
to
listen
to
him
a
circumstance
i
now
rather
regret
for
had
his
dreams
been
equal
to
his
poetry
they
certainly
must
have
possessed
the
rare
merit
of
originality
and
i
could
have
gratified
my
readers
with
something
entirely
out
of
the
common
way
turning
abruptly
from
him
i
entered
into
conversation
with
another
gentleman
and
quite
forgot
my
eccentric
friend
until
i
retired
for
the
night
when
i
found
him
waiting
for
me
in
the
cabin
ho
ho
mister
is
that
you
i
was
afear
we
had
put
you
ashore
what
berth
are
you
goin
to
take
i
pointed
to
no
then
said
he
would
you
have
any
objection
to
my
locating
in
the
one
above
you
as
i
feel
a
afear
it
is
so
awful
dark
and
the
clouds
look
black
as
if
they
be
all
night
the
reason
why
i
prefer
the
upper
berth
is
this
he
continued
confidentially
if
we
should
fall
in
with
a
storm
and
all
go
to
the
bottom
i
should
have
a
better
chance
of
saving
myself
but
mind
you
if
she
should
sink
i
will
give
you
half
of
my
berth
if
come
up
i
thanked
him
for
his
offer
and
not
being
at
all
apprehensive
i
told
him
that
i
preferred
staying
where
i
was
soon
after
i
retired
hoping
to
sleep
but
i
had
not
calculated
on
the
powers
of
annoyance
possessed
by
my
quondam
friend
i
had
just
laid
myself
comfortably
down
when
i
felt
one
of
his
huge
feet
on
the
side
of
my
berth
looking
out
i
espied
him
crawling
up
on
to
his
place
of
security
for
the
night
his
head
had
scarcely
touched
the
pillow
before
he
commenced
telling
me
some
long
yarn
but
i
begged
him
in
no
very
gentle
tone
to
hold
on
till
the
morning
as
i
had
a
very
severe
headache
and
wanted
to
go
to
sleep
i
had
fallen
into
a
sort
of
doze
when
i
thought
i
heard
some
one
talking
in
a
low
voice
close
to
my
ear
i
started
into
a
sitting
posture
and
listened
a
moment
it
was
pitch
dark
i
could
see
nothing
i
soon
however
discovered
that
the
mysterious
sounds
proceeded
from
the
berth
above
me
it
was
my
friend
reciting
either
for
my
amusement
or
his
own
the
poem
he
had
favoured
me
with
in
the
morning
he
was
apparently
nearly
asleep
and
he
drawled
the
sentences
through
his
nose
in
the
most
ludicrous
manner
he
was
recapitulating
the
disastrous
condition
of
cadoga
there
was
mister
in
years
next
morning
tew
feet
mud
he
strove
he
but
in
vain
the
more
he
fell
down
he
got
up
ri
tu
ri
tu
here
followed
a
tremendous
snore
and
i
burst
into
a
prolonged
fit
of
laughter
which
fortunately
did
not
put
a
stop
to
the
sonorous
bass
of
my
companion
overhead
whose
snoring
i
considered
far
more
tolerable
than
his
conversation
just
at
this
moment
the
boat
struck
the
bank
which
it
frequently
does
of
a
very
dark
night
which
gave
the
vessel
such
a
shock
that
it
broke
the
cords
that
secured
the
poet
bed
to
the
beam
above
and
down
he
came
head
foremost
to
the
floor
this
accident
occasioned
me
no
small
discomfort
as
he
nearly
took
my
berth
with
him
it
was
fortunate
for
me
that
i
was
awake
or
he
might
have
killed
me
in
his
descent
as
it
was
i
had
only
time
to
throw
myself
back
when
he
rushed
past
me
with
the
speed
of
an
avalanche
carrying
bed
and
with
him
in
one
confused
heap
and
there
he
lay
upon
the
floor
rolling
and
roaring
like
some
wild
beast
caught
in
a
net
oh
dear
oh
dear
i
wonder
where
i
is
what
a
storm
what
a
dreadful
night
not
a
soul
can
be
saved
i
knew
it
i
dreampt
it
all
oh
lord
we
shall
all
go
to
the
bottom
and
find
eternity
there
captain
captain
where
be
we
here
a
child
belonging
to
one
of
the
passengers
awakened
by
his
bellowing
began
to
cry
oh
dear
some
one
else
captain
captain
confound
him
i
he
drownded
like
the
rest
thank
heaven
here
something
to
hold
on
to
to
keep
me
from
sinking
and
clutching
at
the
table
in
the
dark
he
upset
it
and
broke
the
large
lamp
that
had
been
left
upon
it
down
came
the
broken
glass
upon
him
in
a
shower
which
doubtless
he
took
for
the
waves
breaking
over
him
for
he
raised
such
a
clatter
with
his
hands
and
feet
and
uttered
such
doleful
screams
that
the
passengers
started
simultaneously
from
their
sleep
what
the
matter
is
that
man
mad
or
drunk
exclaimed
several
voices
the
gentleman
beneath
the
again
groaned
forth
we
are
all
lost
if
i
once
get
upon
dry
land
you
never
catch
me
in
a
agin
pitying
his
distress
i
got
up
groped
my
way
to
the
steward
berth
and
succeeded
in
procuring
a
light
when
i
returned
to
the
cabin
i
found
the
poet
lying
on
the
floor
with
the
table
upon
him
and
he
holding
it
fast
with
both
hands
crying
vehemently
i
will
never
let
go
i
will
hang
on
to
the
last
you
are
dreaming
said
i
come
get
up
the
cords
of
your
bed
were
not
strong
enough
to
hold
you
and
you
have
got
a
tumble
on
to
the
floor
nothing
else
is
the
matter
with
you
as
i
ceased
speaking
the
vessel
again
struck
the
bank
and
my
friend
in
his
eagerness
to
save
himself
upset
me
light
and
all
i
again
upset
all
the
small
pieces
of
furniture
in
my
reach
to
the
great
amusement
of
the
passengers
who
were
sitting
up
in
their
berths
listening
to
and
laughing
at
our
conversation
we
were
all
once
more
in
the
dark
and
i
can
assure
my
readers
that
my
situation
was
everything
but
comfortable
as
the
eccentric
gentleman
had
hold
of
both
my
legs
you
foolish
fellow
cried
i
kicking
with
all
my
might
to
free
myself
there
is
no
harm
done
the
boat
has
only
struck
again
upon
the
bank
where
is
the
bank
said
he
still
labouring
under
the
delusion
that
he
was
in
the
water
give
me
a
hold
on
it
if
i
can
only
get
on
the
bank
i
shall
be
safe
finding
it
impossible
to
convince
him
how
matters
really
stood
i
left
him
to
unroll
himself
to
his
full
dimensions
on
the
floor
and
groping
my
way
to
a
sofa
laid
myself
down
once
more
to
sleep
when
the
passengers
met
at
the
the
poor
poet
and
his
misfortunes
during
the
night
gave
rise
to
much
quizzing
and
merriment
particularly
when
he
made
his
appearance
with
a
black
eye
and
the
skin
rubbed
off
the
tip
of
his
nose
one
gentleman
who
was
most
active
in
teasing
him
cried
out
to
me
h
do
try
and
set
last
night
adventures
to
music
and
sing
them
this
evening
at
your
concert
they
would
make
a
i
assure
you
the
poet
looked
daggers
at
us
and
seizing
his
sprang
to
the
deck
and
from
the
deck
to
the
shore
which
he
fortunately
reached
in
safety
without
casting
a
parting
glance
at
his
tormentors
the
mountain
air
rave
not
to
me
of
your
sparkling
wine
bid
not
for
me
the
goblet
shine
my
soul
is
athirst
for
a
draught
more
rare
a
gush
of
the
pure
fresh
mountain
air
it
wafts
on
its
currents
the
rich
perfume
of
the
purple
heath
and
the
honied
broom
the
golden
furze
and
the
hawthorn
fair
shed
all
their
sweets
to
the
mountain
air
it
plays
round
the
bank
and
the
mossy
stone
where
the
violet
droops
like
a
nun
alone
shrouding
her
eyes
from
the
glare
but
breathing
her
soul
to
the
it
gives
to
my
spirits
a
tone
of
mirth

bound

joy

earth
when

blossoms

and
laden
with

my
nectar

the
essence

bud
that

with
me

banquet

let
us
breathe

the
mountain

chapter
vi
the
singing
master
the
conceit
an
excellent
and
sticks
close
to
the
wearer
for
his
mortal
life
it
has
no
spot
nor
wrinkle
in
his
eyes
and
quite
cuts
out
the
coats
of
other
men
he
had
a
fiddle
sadly
out
of
tune
a
voice
as
husky
as
a
raven
croaking
or
owlet
hooting
to
the
clouded
moon
or
bloated
in
some
choking
during
my
professional
journies
through
the
country
i
have
often
had
the
curiosity
to
visit
the
in
the
small
towns
and
villages
through
which
i
passed
these
are
often
taught
by
persons
who
are
perfectly
ignorant
of
the
common
rules
of
music
men
who
have
followed
the
plough
all
their
lives
and
know
about
as
much
of
the
divine
science
they
pretend
to
teach
as
one
of
their
oxen
i
have
often
been
amused
at
their
manner
of
explaining
the
principles
of
their
art
to
their
pupils
who
profit
so
little
by
their
instructions
that
they
are
as
wise
at
the
end
of
their
quarter
as
when
they
began
the
master
usually
endeavours
to
impress
upon
them
the
importance
of
making
themselves
heard
and
calls
him
the
smartest
fellow
who
is
able
to
make
the
most
noise
the
constant
vibration
they
keep
up
through
their
noses
gives
you
the
idea
that
their
teacher
has
been
in
the
habit
of
raising
sheep
and
had
caught
many
of
their
peculiar
notes
this
style
he
very
kindly
imparts
to
his
pupils
and
as
apt
scholars
generally
try
to
imitate
their
master
choirs
taught
by
these
individuals
resemble
a
flock
of
sheep
going
bahing
one
after
another
over
a
wall
i
will
give
you
a
specimen
of
one
of
these
schools
that
i
happened
to
visit
during
my
stay
in
the
town
of
w
in
the
western
states
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
all
music
masters
are
like
the
one
i
am
about
to
describe
but
he
bears
a
very
close
resemblance
to
a
great
many
of
the
same
calling
who
practise
their
profession
in
remote
settlements
where
they
are
not
likely
to
find
many
to
criticise
their
performance
i
had
advertised
a
concert
for
the
of
january
to
be
given
in
the
town
of
w
i
arrived
on
the
day
appointed
and
fortunately
made
the
acquaintance
of
several
gentlemen
amateurs
who
happened
to
be
boarding
at
the
hotel
to
which
i
had
been
recommended
they
kindly
manifested
a
lively
interest
in
my
success
and
promised
to
do
all
in
their
power
to
procure
me
a
good
house
while
seated
at
dinner
one
of
my
new
friends
received
a
note
which
he
said
came
from
a
singing
master
residing
in
a
small
village
a
few
miles
back
of
w
after
reading
the
epistle
and
laughing
heartily
over
its
contents
he
gave
it
to
me
to
my
great
astonishment
it
ran
as
follows
my
dear
roberts
how
do
you
do
i
hope
you
will
excuse
me
for
troubling
you
on
this
occasion
but
i
want
to
ax
you

question
is

acquainted
with
the
man
who
is
to
give
a
sing
in
your
town

you
be
jist
say
to
him
from
me
that

he
will
come
over
here

will
get
him
up
a
house
if
he
will
or
wo
cum
please
let
me
know
i
am
teaching
a
over
here
and
i
can
do
a
great
deal
for
him
if
he
will
only
cum
yours
most
respectfully
john
browne

had
better
go
h
said
roberts
this
john
browne
is
a
queer
chap
and
i
promise
you
lots
of
fun
if
you
decide
upon
going
we
will
all
accompany
you
and
help
to
fill
your
house
by
all
means
said
i
you
will
do
me
a
great
favour
to
return
an
answer
to
the
professional
gentleman
to
that
effect
i
will
send
him
some
of
my
programmes
and
if
he
can
get
a
tolerable
piano
i
will
go
over
and
give
them
a
concert
next
saturday
evening
the
note
and
the
bills
of
performance
were
duly
despatched
to
and
the
next
morning
we
received
an
answer
from
the
singing
master
to
say
that
all
was
right
and
that
browne
would
be
happy
to
give
h
his
valuable
assistance
but
if
possible
he
wished
that
i
could
come
out
on
friday
instead
of
saturday
as
his
school
met
on
that
evening
at
six
and
he
would
like
me
to
witness
the
performance
of
his
scholars
which
would
only
last
from
five
in
the
evening
till
six
and
consequently
need
not
interfere
at
all
with
my
concert
which
was
to
commence
at
eight
we
ordered
a
conveyance
immediately
and
as
it
was
the
very
day
signified
in
the
note
we
started
off
for
the
village
of
on
our
arrival
we
were
met
at
the
door
of
the
only
hotel
in
the
place
by
the
man
a
in
my
line
is
this
you
i
ca
for
the
life
of
me
think
of
your
name
but
no
matter
ai
you
the
chap
as
is
to
give
us
the
this
evening
i
answered
in
the
affirmative
and
he
continued
what
a
leetle
fellow
you
be
now
i
stand
six
feet
four
inches
in
my
boots
and
my
voice
is
high
in
proportion
but
i
you
can
sing
small
fellows
allers
make
a
great
noise
a
bantam
roaster
allers
crows
as
loud
as
an
game
crower
to
make
folks
believe
that
the
is
i
was
very
much
amused
at
his
comparing
me
to
a
bantam
cock
and
felt
almost
inclined
to
clap
my
wings
and
crow
i
have
sent
all
your
bills
about
town
continued
the
odd
man
and
invited
all
the
to
cum
and
hear
you
i
have
engaged
a
good
room
and
a
forty
pound
i
it
worth
as
much
for
is
a
terrible
smart
one
it
belongs
to
deacon
s
and
his
two
daughters
are
the
prettiest
galls
hereabouts
they
play
dan
tucker
and
all
manner
of
tunes
i
found
it
deuced
hard
to
get
the
old
woman
consent
but
i
knew
she
would
refuse
me
as
she
is
looking
out
to
cotch
me
for
one
of
the
daughters
she
made
many
objections
said
that
she
would
rather
the
and
the
and
all
the
rest
of
the
furniture
went
out
of
the
house
than
the
as
she
afear
that
the
strings
would
break
and
all
the
keys
spill
out
by
the
way
the
strings
are
rusty
and
keys
loose
enough
already
i
told
the
old
missus
that
i
would
take
good
care
that
the
right
side
was
kept
uppermost
and
that
if
any
harm
happened
to
the
instrument
you
could
set
it
all
right
agin
i
am
sorry
said
i
to
hear
such
a
poor
account
of
the
instrument
it
is
impossible
to
sing
well
to
a
bad
piano
phoo

nobody
here

to
do
a
considerable
business
in
the
singing
line

have
stirred
up
all
the
girls
and
boys
in
the
place
and
set
them
whistling
an
playing
on

jew
harp
then
i
goes
to
the
old
and
says
to
them

music

young

is
your
duty
to
improve
a
talent
that
providence
has
bestowed
on
your
children
i
puts
on
a
long
face
like
a
parson
when
i
talks
of
providence
and
the
like
and
you
do
know
how
amazingly
it
takes
with
the
old
folks
they
think
that
providence
is
allers
on
the
look
out
to
do
them
some
good
turn
do
you
charge
mr
browne
says
they

in
cheap

i
by
half
the
children

go
says
the
old
man
you
see
to
it
the
children
like
to
hear
themselves
called
genuses
and
they
go
into
it
like
smoke
when
i
am
tuning
my
voice
at
my
lodgings
in
the
evening
just
by
way
of
recreation
the
boys
all
gets
round
my
winder
to
listen
to
my
singing
they
are
so
fond
of
it
i
ca
get
them
away
they
make
such
a
confounded
noise
in
trying
to
imitate
my
splendid
style
but
i
leave
you
to
judge
of
that
for
yourself
you
be
up
with
me
to
the
and
then
you
will
hear
what
i
can
do
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
attend
you
you
see
this
is
my
first
lesson
and
you
must
make
all
allowances
if
there
should
be
any
trouble
or
that
all
should
not
go
right
you
see
one
seldom
gets
the
hang
of
it
the
first
night
no
how
i
have
been
farming
most
of
my
life
but
i
quits
that
about
five
weeks
ago
and
have
been
studying
hard
for
my
profession
ever
since
i
have
got
a
large
school
here
another
at
a
and
another
at
l
and
before
the
winter
is
over
i
shall
be
qualified
to
teach
at
w
i
play
the
big
bass
fiddle
and
the
violin
right
off
and
here
a
little
boy
came
running
up
to
say
that
his
father
sheep
had
got
out
of
the
yard
and
had
gone
down
to
deacon
s
and
said
he
the
folks
have
sent
for
you
mister
browne
to
cum
and
turn
out
a
merciful
intervention
of
providence
thought
i
who
was
already
heartily
weary
of
my
new
acquaintance
and
began
to
be
afraid
that
i
never
should
get
rid
of
him
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
so
tired
of
looking
up
at
him
that
i
felt
that
i
could
not
converse
much
longer
with
him
without
endangering
the
elasticity
of
my
neck
and
he
would
have
been
affronted
if
i
had
asked
him
to
walk
in
and
sit
down
he
was
not
very
well
pleased
with
deacon
s
message
that
comes
of
borrowing
mister
if
i
had
not
asked
the
loan
of
the
they
never
would
have
sent
for
me
to
look
arter
their
darned
sheep
i
must
go
however
i
hope
you
be
able
to
keep
yourself
alive
in
my
absence
i
have
got
to
string
up
the
old
fiddle
for
the
is
about
a
mile
from
this
i
will
come
down
with
my
old
mare
arter
you
when
its
just
time
to
be
so
away
he
strode
at
the
rate
of
six
miles
an
hour
his
long
legs
accomplishing
at
one
step
what
would
have
taken
a
man
of
my
dimensions
three
to
compass
i
then
went
into
the
hotel
to
order
dinner
for
my
friends
as
he
had
allowed
me
no
opportunity
to
do
so
the
conceited
fellow
had
kept
me
standing
a
foot
deep
in
snow
for
the
last
hour
while
listening
to
his
intolerably
dull
conversation
my
disgust
and
disappointment
afforded
great
amusement
to
my
friends
but
in
spite
of
all
my
entreaties
they
could
not
be
induced
to
leave
their
punch
and
a
warm
fire
to
accompany
me
in
my
pilgrimage
to
the
we
took
dinner
at
four
and
the
cloth
was
scarcely
drawn
when
my
musical
friend
made
his
appearance
with
the
old
mare
to
take
me
along
to
the
school
our
was
everything
but
prepossessing
a
large
unwieldy
cutter
of
home
manufacture
the
boards
of
which
it
was
composed
unplained
and
unpainted
with
rope
harness
and
an
undressed
bull
hide
by
way
of
buffalo
formed
our
equipage
but
no
description
that
i
could
give
you
would
do
justice
to
the
old
mare
a
sorry
beast
she
was
thick
legged
rough
coated
and
of
a
dirty
her
eyes
over
one
of
which
a
film
was
spread
were
dull
as
the
eyes
of
a
stale
fish
and
her
temples
so
hollow
that
she
looked
as
if
she
had
been
worn
out
by
dragging
the
last
two
generations
to
their
graves
i
was
ashamed
of
adding
one
more
to
the
many
burdens
she
must
have
borne
in
her
day
and
i
almost
wished
that
she
had
realized
in
her
own
person
the
verse
in
the
scotch
song
the
auld
man
mare
dead
a
mile
ayont
dundee
before
i
ever
had
set
my
eyes
upon
her
can
she
carry
us
said
i
pausing
irresolutely
with
my
foot
on
the
rough
heavy
runner
of
the
cutter
i
guess
she
can
quoth
he
she
will
skim
like
a
bird
over
the
snow
so
get
into
the
sleigh
and
we
will
go
straight
off
to
the
it
was
intensely
cold
i
drew
the
collar
of
my
over
my
ears
and
wrapped
my
half
of
the
bull
hide
well
round
my
feet
and
we
started
the
old
mare
went
better
than
could
have
been
expected
from
such
a
skeleton
of
a
beast
to
be
sure
she
had
no
weight
of
flesh
to
encumber
her
motions
and
we
were
getting
on
pretty
well
when
the
music
master
drove
too
near
a
stump
which
suddenly
upset
us
both
and
tumbled
him
head
foremost
into
a
bank
of
snow
i
fortunately
rolled
out
of
him
and
soon
extricated
myself
from
the
difficulty
but
i
found
it
no
easy
matter
to
drag
my
ponderous
companion
from
beneath
the
snow
and
the
old
bull
hide
in
which
he
was
completely
enveloped
the
old
mare
stood
perfectly
still
gazing
with
her
one
eye
intently
on
the
mischief
she
had
done
as
if
she
never
had
been
guilty
of
such
a
breach
of
manners
before
after
shaking
the
snow
from
our
garments
and
getting
all
right
for
a
second
start
my
companion
exclaimed
in
an
agonized
tone
my
fiddle
where
where
is
my
fiddle
i
can
do
nothing
without
my
fiddle
we
immediately
went
in
search
of
it
but
we
did
not
succeed
in
finding
it
for
some
time
i
had
given
it
up
in
despair
and
with
cold
was
stepping
into
the
cutter
to
take
the
benefit
of
the
old
hide
when
fortunately
for
the
music
master
one
of
the
strings
of
the
lost
instrument
snapped
with
the
cold
we
followed
the
direction
of
the
sound
and
soon
beheld
the
poor
fiddle
sticking
in
a
and
concealed
by
a
projecting
stump
the
instrument
had
sustained
no
other
injury
than
the
loss
of
three
of
the
strings
well
ar
that
too
bad
says
he
i
have
no
more
catgut
without
sending
to
w
that
done
for
at
least
for
it
very
cold
i
cried
impatiently
seeing
that
he
was
in
no
hurry
to
move
on
do
let
us
be
going
you
can
examine
your
instrument
better
in
the
house
than
standing
up
to
your
knees
in
the
snow
i
was
born
in
the
backwoods
say
he
i
do
feel
the
cold
then
jumping
into
the
cutter
he
gave
me
the
fiddle
to
take
care
of
and
pointing
with
the
right
finger
of
his
catskin
gloves
to
a
solitary
house
on
the
top
of
a
bleak
hill
nearly
a
mile
he
said
that
white
building
is
the
place
where
the
school
is
held
we
soon
reached
the
spot
this
is
the
old
methodist
church
mister
and
a
capital
place
for
the
voice
there
is
no
furniture
or
hangings
to
interrupt
the
sound
go
right
in
while
i
hitch
the
mare
i
will
be
arter
you
in
a
brace
of
shakes
i
soon
found
myself
in
the
body
of
the
old
dilapidated
church
and
subjected
to
the
stare
of
a
number
of
very
girls
and
boys
who
certainly
from
their
appearance
would
never
have
led
you
to
suppose
that
they
ever
could
belong
to
a
philharmonic
society
presently
browne
made
his
debut
assuming
an
air
of
great
importance
as
he
approached
his
pupils
he
said
ladies
and
gentlemen
allow
me
to
introduce
to
your
notice
h
the
celebrated
vocalist
he
has
cum
all
the
way
from
new
york
on
purpose
to
hear
you
sing
the
boys
grinned
at
me
and
twirled
their
thumbs
the
girls
nudged
one
another
elbows
and
giggled
while
their
eloquent
teacher
continued
i
do
know
as
how
we
shall
be
able
to
do
much
tonight
we
upset
and
that
spilt
my
fiddle
into
the
snow
you
see
holding
it
up
right
full
of
it
and
that
busted
the
strings
a
dropsical
fiddle
is
no
good
no
how
jist
look
at
the
water
dripping
out
of
her
again
the
boys
laughed
and
the
girls
giggled
said
he
hold
on
do
laugh
it
no
laughing
matter
as
you
find
after
a
long
pause
in
which
the
youngsters
tried
their
best
to
look
grave
he
went
on
now
all
of
you
girls
and
boys
give
your
attention
to
my
instructions
this
evening
i
goin
to
introduce
a
new
style
for
your
special
benefit
called
the
pestalozzi
system
now
all
the
fashion
if
you
are
all
ready

your
books

them
up
one
two
three
three
books
for
forty
pupils
that
will
never
do
we
ca
sing
well
never
mind
you
see
that
black
board
i
will
give
you
a
lesson
upon
that
who
got
a
piece
of
chalk
a
negative
shake
of
the
head
from
all
to
me
chalk
scarce
in
these
diggings
to
the
boys
what
nobody
got
a
piece
of
chalk
unlucky
a
piece
of
charcoal
out
of
the
stove
will
do
as
well
no
wo
roared
out
a
boy
with
a
very
ragged
coat
they
be
both
the
same
colour
true
jenkins
for
you
go
out
and
get
a
lump
of
snow
its
darnation
strange
if
i
ca
fix
it
somehow
now
thought
i
what
is
this
clever
fellow
going
to
do
the
boys
winked
at
each
other
and
a
murmur
of
suppressed
laughter
ran
through
the
old
church
jenkins
ran
out
and
soon
returned
with
a
lump
of
snow
browne
took
a
small
piece
and
squeezing
it
tight
stuck
it
upon
the
board
now
boys
that
is
do
and
that
is
re
and
that
is
do
again
and
that
is
mi
this
do
and
that
fa
and
that
boys
is
a
part
of
what
we
call
a
then
turning
to
a
tall
thin
man
very
much
out
at
the
elbows
whom
i
had
not
seen
before
he
said
smith
how
is
your
viol
you
got
it
tuned
up
yet
well
squire
i
guess
it
complete
hold
on
let
me
see
and
taking
a
from
his
pocket
and
giving
it
a
sharp
thump
upon
the
stove
he
cried
out
in
a
still
louder
key
now
that
a
jist
tune
up
to
a
after
smith
had
succeeded
in
tuning
his
instrument
the
teacher
proceeded
with
his
lucid
explanations
now
boys
start
fair
give
a
grand
chord
what
sort
of
a
noise
do
you
call
that
giving
a
luckless
boy
a
thump
over
the
head
with
his
you
bray
through
your
nose
like
a
jackass
i
tell
you
to
quit
i
do
want
discord
the
boy
slunk
out
of
the
class
and
stood
blubbering
behind
the
door
tune
up
again
young
shavers
sing
the
notes
as
i
have
made
them
on
the
board
do
mi
now
when
i
count
four
commence
one
two
three
four
sing
hold
on
hold
on
do
you
see
that
all
the
notes
are
running
off
and
you
ca
sing
running
notes
yet
here
he
was
interrupted
by
the
noise
of
some
one
forcing
their
way
into
the
church
in
a
very
strange
and
unceremonious
manner
and
the
chorister
song
that
late
was
so
strong
grew
a
quaver
of
consternation
the
door
burst
open
and
a
ghastly
head
was
protruded
through
the
aperture
a
ghost
a
ghost
shrieked
out
all
the
children
in
a
breath
and
jumping
over
the
forms
they
huddled
around
the
stove
upsetting
the
solitary
tallow
candle
the
desk
and
the
bass
viol
in
their
flight
one
lad
sprang
right
upon
the
unfortunate
instrument
which
broke
to
pieces
with
a
terrible
crash
we
were
now
left
in
the
dark
the
girls
screamed
and
clung
round
me
for
protection
while
the
ghastly
apparition
continued
to
stare
upon
us
through
the
gloom
with
its
large
hollow
eyes
i
must
confess
that
i
felt
rather
queer
but
i
wisely
kept
my
fears
to
myself
while
i
got
as
far
from
the
door
as
i
possibly
could
just
as
our
terror
had
reached
a
climax
the
grizzly
phantom
uttered
a
low
whining
neigh
it
the
old
mare
i
be
darned
if
it
is
cried
one
of
the
older
boys
at
the
top
of
his
voice
this
restored
confidence
to
the
rest
and
one
rather
bolder
than
his
comrades
at
length
ventured
to
relight
the
fallen
candle
at
the
stove
and
holding
it
up
displayed
to
our
view
the
old
white
mare
standing
in
the
doorway
the
poor
beast
had
forced
her
way
into
the
porch
to
protect
herself
from
the
cold
and
she
looked
at
her
master
as
much
as
to
say
i
have
a
standing
account
against
you
no
doubt
her
sudden
intrusion
had
been
the
means
of
shortening
her
term
of
probation
by
at
least
half
an
hour
and
of
bringing
the
to
a
close
she
had
been
the
innocent
cause
of
disabling
both
the
musical
instruments
and
browne
could
not
raise
a
correct
note
without
them
turning
to
his
pupils
with
a
very
rueful
countenance
and
speaking
in
a
very
unmusical
voice
but
very
expressive
withal
he
said
chore
meaning
choir
you
are
dimissed
but
hold
on
do
be
in
such
a
darnation
hurry
to
be
off
i
was
to
tell
you
this
ere
gentleman
h
my
name
for
a
wonder
poppping
into
his
head
at
that
minute
is
to
give
a
night
it
was
to
have
been
but
he
changed
his
mind
that
he
might
have
the
pleasure
of
hearing
you
i
shall
assist
h
in
the
singing
department
so
you
must
all
be
sure
to
cum
tickets
for
boys
over
ten
years
cents
under
ten
twelve
and
a
half
cents
so
you
chaps
will
know
what
to
do
the
next
time
the
school
meets
will
be
when
the
fiddles
are
fixed
now
scamper
the
children
were
not
long
in
obeying
the
order
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
they
were
off
and
we
heard
them
shouting
and
in
the
lane
cum
h
said
the
buttoning
his
up
to
his
chin
let
us
be
on
reaching
the
spot
where
we
had
left
the
cutter
to
our
great
disappointment
we
found
only
of
it
remaining
the
other
half
broken
to
pieces
strewed
the
ground
browne
detained
me
for
another
in
gathering
together
the
fragments
now
you
smith
you
take
care
of
the
crippled
fiddles
while
i
take
care
of
the
bag
of
oats
the
old
mare
has
been
trying
to
hook
them
out
of
the
cutter
which
has
been
the
cause
of
all
the
trouble
you
h
mount
up
on
the
old
jade
and
take
along
the
bull
hide
and
we
will
follow
on
foot
yes
said
i
and
glad
of
the
chance
for
i
am
cold
and
tired
not
knowing
a
step
of
the
way
i
let
browne
and
his
companion
go
and
making
a
sort
of
of
the
old
hide
i
curled
myself
up
on
the
back
of
the
old
mare
and
left
her
to
her
own
pace
which
however
was
a
pretty
round
trot
until
we
reached
the
outskirts
of
the
town
where
dismounting
i
thanked
my
companions
very
insincerely
i
afraid
for
my
evening
amusement
and
joined
my
friends
at
the
hotel
who
were
never
tired
of
hearing
me
recount
my
adventures
at
the
i
had
been
obliged
to
postpone
my
own
concert
until
the
next
evening
for
i
found
the
borrowed
piano
such
a
poor
one
and
so
miserably
out
of
tune
that
it
took
me
several
hours
rendering
it
at
all
fit
for
service
before
i
had
concluded
my
task
i
was
favoured
with
the
company
of
browne
who
stuck
to
me
closer
than
a
brother
never
allowing
me
out
of
his
sight
for
a
moment
this
persevering
attention
so
little
in
unison
with
my
feelings
caused
me
the
most
insufferable
annoyance
a
thousand
times
i
was
on
the
point
of
dismissing
him
very
unceremoniously
by
informing
him
that
i
thought
him
a
most
conceited
impertinent
puppy
but
for
the
sake
of
my
friend
roberts
who
was
in
some
way
related
to
the
fellow
i
contrived
to
master
my
anger
about
four
he
jumped
up
from
the
table
at
which
he
had
been
lounging
and
sipping
hot
punch
at
my
expense
for
the
last
hour
exclaiming
i
guess
it
time
for
me
to
see
the
carried
up
to
the
room
it
all
ready
said
i
perhaps
browne
you
will
oblige
me
by
singing
a
song
before
the
company
arrives
that
i
may
judge
how
far
your
style
and
mine
will
agree
for
i
began
to
have
some
horrible
misgivings
on
the
subject
if
you
will
step
upstairs
i
will
accompany
you
on
the
piano
i
had
no
opportunity
of
hearing
you
sing
last
night
no
no
said
he
with
a
conceited
laugh
i
mean
to
astonish
you
by
and
by
i
not
one
of
your
common
amateurs
no
how
i
shall
produce
quite
a
sensation
upon
your
audience
so
saying
he
darted
through
the
door
and
left
me
to
finish
my
arrangements
for
the
night
the
hour
appointed
for
the
concert
at
length
arrived
it
was
a
clear
frosty
night
the
moon
shining
as
bright
as
day
a
great
number
of
persons
were
collected
about
the
doors
of
the
hotel
and
i
had
every
reason
to
expect
a
full
house
i
was
giving
some
directions
to
my
when
i
heard
a
double
sleigh
approaching
at
an
uncommon
rate
and
looking
up
the
road
i
saw
an
vehicle
drawn
by
two
horses
coming
towards
the
hotel
at
full
gallop
the
passengers
evidently
thought
that
they
were
too
late
and
were
making
up
for
lost
time
the
driver
was
an
old
farmer
and
dressed
in
the
cloth
of
the
country
with
a
large
capote
of
the
same
material
drawn
over
his
head
and
face
which
left
his
sharp
black
eyes
red
nose
and
wide
mouth
alone
visible
he
flourished
in
his
hand
a
large
whip
of
raw
hide
which
ever
and
anon
descended
upon
the
backs
of
his
rawboned
cattle
like
the
strokes
of
a
flail
get
up
go
along
waye
cried
he
suddenly
drawing
up
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
well
here
we
be
at
last
and
jist
in
time
for
the
then
hitching
the
horses
to
the
post
and
flinging
the
buffalo
robes
over
them
he
left
the
three
females
he
was
driving
in
the
sleigh
and
ran
directly
up
to
me
ar
you
the
man
i
guess
you
be
by
them
ere
black
pants
and
gear
i
nodded
assent
what
the
damage
half
a
dollar
half
a
dollar
you
do
mean
to
say
that
not
a
cent
less
well
it
will
be
there
my
wife
and
two
darters
and
myself
and
the
galls
never
seed
a
well
said
i
as
there
are
four
of
you

may
come
in
at
a
dollar
and
a
half
how
a
dollar
and
a
harf
i
will
go
and
have
a
talk
with
the
old
woman
and
hear
what
she
says
to
it
he
returned
to
the
sleigh
and
after
chatting
for
a
few
minutes
with
the
women
he
helped
them
out
and
the
four
followed
me
into
the
common
reception
room
of
the
inn
the
farmer
placed
a
pail
of
butter
on
the
table
and
said
with
a
shrewd
curl
of
his
long
nose
and
a
wink
from
one
of
his
cunning
black
eyes
there
some
pretty
good
butter
mister
i
was
amused
at
the
idea
and
replied
pretty
good
butter
what
is
that
to
me
i
do
not
buy
butter
not
buy
butter
why
you
do
say
it
is
the
very
best
article
in
the
market
jist
now
for
a
bit
of
fun
i
said
never
mind
i
will
take
your
butter
what
is
it
worth
it
was
worth
ten
cents
last
week
mister
i
do
know
what
it
worth
now
it
ca
have
fallen
i
took
my
knife
from
my
pocket
and
in
a
very
manner
proceeded
to
taste
the
article
why
said
i
this
butter
is
not
good
here
a
woman
stepped
briskly
up
and
poking
her
head
between
us
said
at
the
highest
pitch
of
her
cracked
voice
yes
it
is
good
it
was
made
this
morning
for
the
i
beg
your
pardon
madam
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
buying
butter
to
oblige
you
i
will
take
this
how
much
is
there
of
it
i
do
know
where
are
your
steelyards
oh
said
i
laughing
i
do
carry
such
things
with
me
i
will
take
it
at
your
own
valuation
and
you
may
go
in
with
your
family
is
a
bargain
says
she
go
in
galls
and
fix
yourselves
for
the
as
the
room
was
fast
filling
i
thought
it
time
to
present
myself
to
the
company
and
made
my
entrance
accompanied
by
that
incorrigible
pest
the
singing
master
who
without
the
least
embarrassment
took
his
seat
by
the
piano
after
singing
several
of
my
best
songs
i
invited
him
to
try
his
skill
oh
certainly
said
he
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
am
a
su
rprised
that
you
did
not
ask
me
to
lead
off
i
would
have
done
so
but
i
could
not
alter
the
arrangement
of
the
programme
ah
well
i
excuse
you
this
time
but
it
was
not
very
polite
to
say
the
least
of
it
then
taking
my
seat
at
the
piano
with
as
much
confidence
as
braham
ever
had
he
run
his
hand
over
the
keys
exclaiming
what
shall
i
sing
i
will
give
you
one
of
russell
songs
they
suit
my
voice
best
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
am
going
to
favour
you
by
singing
henry
russell
celebrated
song
love
to
roam
and
accompany
myself
upon
the
this
song
is
so
well
known
to
most
of
my
readers
that
i
can
describe
his
manner
of
singing
it
without
repeating
the
whole
of
the
words
he
struck
the
instrument
in
playing
with
such
violence
that
it
shook
his
whole
body
and
produced
the
following
ludicrous
effect
some
love
to
the
dark
sea
where
the
shrill
winds
whistle
but
a
in
a
mountain
and
life
in
the
for
this
performance
was
drowned
in
an
uproar
of
laughter
which
brought
our
vocalist
to
a
sudden
stop
i
wo
sing
another
line
if
you
keep
up
that
infernal
noise
he
roared
at
the
top
of
his
voice
when
a
fellow
does
his
best
he
expects
his
audience
to
appreciate
his
performance
but
i
allers
as
how
the
folks
at
w
knew
nothing
about
music
oh
do
stop
exclaimed
an
old
woman
rising
from
her
seat
and
shaking
her
fist
at
the
unruly
company
ca
yee
he
do
sing
and
his
voice
in
the
winds
do
sound
so
i
could
almost
hear
them
an
it
minds
me
of
old
times
it
dew
this
voluntary
tribute
to
his
genius
seemed
to
console
and
reassure
the
singing
master
and
stemming
with
his
stentorian
voice
the
torrent
of
mistimed
mirth
he
sang
his
song
triumphantly
to
the
end
and
the
clapping
of
hands
stamping
of
feet
and
knocking
of
benches
were
truly
deafening
what
will
you
have
now
cried
he
i
thought
you
would
comprehend
good
singing
at
last
give
them
a
comic
song
said
i
in
a
whisper
a
comic
song
aloud
do
you
think
that
i
would
waste
my
talents
in
singing
trash
that
any
jackass
could
bray
no
sirra
my
style
is
purely
i
will
give
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
the
green
he
sang
this
beautiful
original
song
which
is
decidedly
russell
best
much
in
the
same
style
as
the
former
one
but
getting
a
little
used
to
his
eccentricities
we
contrived
to
keep
our
gravity
until
he
came
to
the
chorus
creeping
creeping
creeping
for
which
he
substituted
crawling
crawling
crawling
when
he
was
again
interrupted
by
such
a
burst
of
merriment
that
he
was
unable
to
crawl
any
further
well
said
he
rising
if
you
wo
behave
i
will
leave
the
instrument
to
h
and
make
one
of
the
audience
he
had
scarcely
taken
his
seat
when
the
farmer
from
whom
i
had
bought
the
butter
forced
his
way
up
to
the
piano
says
he
there
that
pail
it
is
worth
ten
cents
and
a
half
you
must
either
pay
the
money
or
give
me
back
the
hitching
up
his
nether
garments
i
you
do
the
thing
that
right
oh
certainly
there
are
twelve
and
a
half
cents
i
change
said
he
with
a
knowing
look
so
much
the
better
keep
the
difference
then
we
square
mister
and
he
sank
back
into
his
place
did
he
pay
you
the
money
i
heard
the
wife
ask
in
an
anxious
tone
yes
yes
more
than
the
old
pail
was
worth
by
a
long
chalk
i
like
to
deal
with
that
chap
allers
i
now
proceeded
with
the
concert
the
song
of
the
drowning
child
saved
by
the
newfoundland
dog
drew
down
thunders
of
applause
when
the
clamour
had
a
little
subsided
a
tall
man
rose
from
his
seat
at
the
upper
end
of
the
room
and
after
clearing
his
throat
with
several
loud
hems
he
thus
addressed
me
how
do
you
do
h
i
am
glad
sir
to
make
your
acquaintance
this
is
my
friend
derby
drawing
another
tall
man
conspicuously
forward
before
all
the
spectators
he
tew
is
very
happy
to
make
your
acquaintance
we
both
want
to
know
if
that
dog
you
have
been
singing
about
belongs
to
you
if
so
we
should
be
glad
to
buy
a
pup
he
gravely
took
his
seat
amid
perfect
yells
of
applause
it
was
impossible
to
be
heard
in
such
a
riot
and
i
closed
the
adventures
of
the
evening
by
giving
out
columbia
to
be
sung
by
all
present
this
gave
universal
satisfaction
and
the
voice
of
my
friend
the
singing
master
might
be
heard
far
above
the
rest
i
was
forced
in
common
politeness
to
invite
browne
to
partake
of
the
oyster
supper
i
had
provided
for
my
friends
from
w
will
you
join
our
party
this
evening
mr
browne
oh
by
all
manner
of
means
said
he
rubbing
his
hands
together
in
a
sort
of
ecstasy
of
anticipation
i
knew
that
you
would
do
the
thing
handsome
at
last
i
have
not
tasted
an
since
i
sang
at
in
new
york
but
did
we
not
come
on
famously
at
the
confess
now
that
i
beat
you
holler
you
sing
well
but
you
want
confidence
you
do
give
expression
enough
to
your
voice
the
applause
which
followed
my
first
song
was
tremendous
i
never
heard
anything
like
it
browne
i
never
expect
to
merit
such
marks
of
public
approbation
all
in
good
time
my
friend
returned
he
clapping
me
familiarly
on
the
shoulder
rome
was
not
built
in
a
day
and
you
are
a
young
man
a
very
young
man
and
very
for
your
age
your
voice
will
never
have
the
volume
and
compass
of
mine
but
i
smell
the
let
in
for
i
tarnation
hungry
gentle
reader
you
would
have
thought
so
to
have
seen
him
eat
my
companions
looked
rather
disconcerted
at
the
rapidity
with
which
they
disappeared
within
his
capacious
jaws
after
satisfying
his
enormous
appetite
he
washed
down
the
oysters
with
long
draughts
of
porter
until
his
brain
becoming
affected
he
swung
his
huge
body
back
in
his
chair
and
placing
his
feet
on
the
began
singing
in
good
earnest
not
one
song
in
particular
but
a
mixture
of
all
that
had
appeared
in
the
most
popular
yankee
song
books
for
the
last
ten
years
i
wish
i
could
give
you
a
specimen
of
the
sublime
and
the
ridiculous
thus
unceremoniously
huddled
together
the
effect
was
so
irresistible
when
contrasted
with
the
grave
exterior
of
the
man
that
we
laughed
until
our
side
ached
at
his
absurdities
exhausted
by
his
constant
vociferations
the
musician
at
length
dropped
from
his
chair
in
a
drunken
sleep
upon
the
floor
and
we
carried
him
into
the
next
room
and
put
him
to
bed
and
after
talking
over
the
events
of
the
evening
we
retired
about
midnight
to
our
respective
chambers
which
all
opened
into
the
great
room
in
which
i
held
the
concert
about
two
in
the
morning
my
sleep
was
disturbed
by
the
most
dismal
cries
and
groans
which
appeared
to
issue
from
the
adjoining
apartment
i
rubbed
my
eyes
and
sat
up
in
the
bed
and
listened
when
i
recognized
the
voice
of
the
singing
master
exclaiming
in
tones
of
agony
and
fear
landlord
landlord
cum
quick
somebody
cum
landlord
landlord
there
a
man
under
my
bed
oh
lord
i
shall
be
murdered
a
man
under
my
bed
as
i
am
not
fond
of
such
nocturnal
visitors
myself
not
being
much
gifted
with
physical
strength
or
courage
i
listened
a
moment
to
hear
if
any
one
was
coming
the
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
along
the
passage
greatly
aided
the
desperate
effort
i
made
to
leave
my
comfortable
pillow
and
proceed
to
the
scene
of
action
at
the
chamber
door
i
met
the
landlord
armed
with
the
and
a
light
what
all
this
noise
about
he
cried
in
an
angry
tone
i
assured
him
that
i
was
as
ignorant
as
himself
of
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
here
the
singing
master
again
sung
out
landlord
landlord
there
a
under
the
cum
somebody
cum
we
immediately
entered
his
room
and
were
joined
by
two
of
my
friends
from
w
seeing
our
party
strengthened
to
four
our
courage
rose
amazingly
and
we
talked
loudly
of
making
mincemeat
of
the
intruder
kicking
him
down
stairs
and
torturing
him
in
every
way
we
could
devise
we
found
the
singing
master
sitting
bolt
upright
in
his
bed
his
gathered
up
under
his
arm
ready
for
a
start
his
face
as
pale
as
a
sheet
his
teeth
chattering
and
his
whole
appearance
indicative
of
the
most
abject
fear
we
certainly
did
hear
very
mysterious
sounds
issuing
from
beneath
the
bed
which
caused
the
boldest
of
us
to
draw
back
he
is
right
said
roberts
there
is
some
one
under
the
bed
what
a
set
of
confounded
cowards
you
are
cried
the
landlord
you
lift
the
valance
and
see
what
it
is
he
made
no
effort
himself
to
ascertain
the
cause
of
the
alarm
roberts
who
after
all
was
the
boldest
man
of
the
party
seized
the
tongs
from
the
landlord
and
kneeling
cautiously
down
slowly
raised
the
drapery
that
surrounded
the
bed
hold
the
light
here
landlord
he
did
so
but
at
arm
length
roberts
peeped
timidly
into
the
dark
void
beyond
dropped
the
valance
and
looked
up
with
a
comical
quizzing
expression
and
began
to
laugh
what
is
it
we
all
cried
in
a
breath
landlord
landlord
he
cried
imitating
the
voice
of
the
singing
master
cum
quick
somebody
cum
there
a
dog
under
the
bed
he
will
bite
me
oh
dear
oh
dear
i
shall
die
of
hydrophobia
i
shall
be
smothered
in
a
a
dog
said
the
landlord
a
dog
cried
we
all
aye
a
black
dog
you
do
say
cried
the
singing
master
springing
from
his
bed
where
is
he
i
able
for
any
how
and
seizing
a
corn
broom
that
stood
in
a
corner
of
the
room
he
began
to
poke
at
the
poor
animal
and
belabour
him
in
the
most
unmerciful
manner
the
dog
who
belonged
to
a
drover
who
penned
his
cattle
in
the
for
the
night
wishing
to
find
a
comfortable
domicile
had
taken
a
private
survey
of
the
premises
when
the
people
were
out
of
the
way
and
made
his
quarters
under
browne
bed
when
that
worthy
commenced
snoring
the
dog
to
signify
his
approbation
at
finding
himself
in
the
company
of
some
one
amused
himself
by
hoisting
his
tail
up
and
down
now
striking
the
sacking
of
the
bed
and
now
tapping
audibly
against
the
floor
these
mysterious
salutations
became
at
length
so
frequent
and
vehement
that
they
awoke
the
sleeper
who
not
daring
to
ascertain
the
cause
of
the
alarm
aroused
the
whole
house
with
his
clamours
browne
finding
himself
unable
to
thrash
the
poor
brute
out
of
his
retreat
and
having
become
all
of
a
sudden
very
brave
crawled
under
the
bed
and
dragged
the
dog
out
by
his
hind
legs
you
see
i
enough
for
him
give
me
the
poker
and
i
beat
out
his
brains
you
do
no
such
thing
sir
said
the
landlord
turning
the
animal
down
the
stairs
the
dog
belongs
to
a
quiet
decent
fellow
and
a
good
customer
and
he
shall
meet
with
no
ill
usage
here
your
mountain
browne
has
brought
forth
a
mouse
a
dog
sir
quoth
the
singing
master
not
in
the
least
abashed
by
the
reproof
if
the
brute
had
cut
up
such
a
dido
under
your
bed
you
would
have
been
as
sceared
as
i
was
perhaps
browne
said
i
you
took
it
for
the
ghost
of
the
old
mare
ghost
or
no
ghost
returned
the
landlord
he
has
given
us
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
nearly
frightened
himself
into
fits
the
fear
was
not
all
on
my
side
said
the
indignant
vocalist
and
i
look
upon
you
as
the
cause
of
the
whole
trouble
as
how
if
the
dog
had
not
cum
to
your
house
he
never
would
have
found
his
way
under
my
bed
when
i
pay
for
my
night
lodging
i
do
expect
to
have
to
share
it
with
a
strange
dog
no
how
so
saying
he
retreated
grumbling
back
to
his
bed
and
we
gladly
followed
his
example
i
rose
early
in
the
morning
to
accompany
my
friends
to
w
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
i
was
accosted
by
browne
why
you
ar
goin
to
start
without
bidding
me
besides
you
have
not
paid
me
for
my
assistance
at
the
i
literally
started
with
surprise
at
this
unexpected
demand
do
you
expect
a
professional
price
for
your
services
well
i
guess
the
would
have
been
nothing
without
my
help
but
i
wo
be
hard
upon
you
as
you
are
a
young
beginner
and
not
likely
to
make
your
fortune
in
that
line
any
how
there
that
pail
of
butter
if
you
do
mean
to
take
it
along
i
take
that
we
wants
butter
to
hum
is
it
a
bargain
oh
yes
if
you
are
satisfied
i
am
well
pleased
i
could
have
added
to
get
rid
of
you
at
any
price
you
will
find
it
on
the
table
in
the
hall
not
exactly
i
took
it
hum
this
morning
i
thought
how
it
would
end
to
you
h
if
ever
you
come
this
way
again
i
shall
be
happy
to
lend
you
my
assistance
i
never
visited
that
part
of
the
countryside
since
but
i
have
no
doubt
that
browne
is
busy
in
his
vocation
and
flattering
himself
that
he
is
one
of
the
first
vocalists
in
the
union
i
think
he
should
change
his
residence

shannonville
owes
its

flourishing
prospects
to
the
energy
and
enterprise
of
a
few
individuals
who
saw
at
a
glance
its
capabilities
and
purchased
for
a
few
hundred
pounds
the
site
of
a

is

on
the
road
leading
from
belleville
to
this
place
which
is
in
the
direct
route
to
kingston
there
is
a
large
tract
of
plain
land
which
is
still
uncultivated
the
soil
is
sandy
and
the
trees
are
low
and
far
apart
a
natural
growth
short
grass
and
flowering
shrubs
giving
it
very
much
the
appearance
of
a
park
clumps
of
butternut
and
hiccory
trees
form
picturesque
groups
and
herds
of
cattle
belonging
to
the
settlers
in
the
vicinity
roam
at
large
over
these
plains
that
sweep
down
to
the
water
edge
this
is
a
very
favourite
resort
of
summer
parties
as
you
can
drive
light
carriages
in
all
directions
over
this
elevated
platform
it
used
formerly
to
be
a
chosen
spot
for
and
all
the
piously
disposed
came
hither
to
listen
to
the
preachers
and
get
religion
i
never
witnessed
one
of
these
meetings
but
an
old
lady
gave
me
a
very
graphic
description
of
one
of
them
that
was
held
on
this
spot
some
thirty
years
ago
there
were
no
churches
in
belleville
then
and
the
travelling
methodist
ministers
used
to
pitch
their
tents
on
these
plains
and
preach
night
and
day
to
all
goers
and
comers
a
pulpit
formed
of
rough
slabs
of
wood
was
erected
in
a
conveniently
open
space
among
the
trees
and
they
took
it
by
turns
to
read
exhort
and
pray
to
the
dwellers
in
the
wilderness
at
right
they
kindled
large
fires
which
served
both
for
light
and
warmth
and
enabled
the
pilgrims
to
this
sylvan
shrine
to
cook
their
food
and
attend
to
their
wants
of
their
little
ones
large
booths
made
of
the
boughs
of
trees
sheltered
the
worshippers
from
the
heat
of
the
sun
during
the
day
or
from
the
occasional
showers
produced
by
some
passing
thunder
cloud
at
night
our
bush
farm
said
my
friend
happened
to
be
near
the
spot
and
i
went
with
a
young
girl
a
friend
and
neighbour
partly
out
of
curiosity
and
partly
out
of
fun
to
hear
the
preaching
it
was
the
middle
of
july
but
the
weather
was
unusually
wet
for
that
time
of
year
and
every
tent
and
booth
was
crowded
with
men
women
and
children
all
huddled
together
to
keep
out
of
the
rain
most
of
these
tents
exhibited
some
extraordinary
scene
of
fanaticism
and
religious
enthusiasm
the
noise
and
confusion
were
deafening
men
were
preaching
at
the
very
top
of
their
voice
women
were
shrieking
and
groaning
beating
their
breasts
and
tearing
their
hair
while
others
were
uttering
the
most
frantic
outcries
which
they
called
one
thought
possessed
me
all
the
time
that
the
whole
assembly
were
mad
and
that
they
imagined
god
to
be
deaf
and
that
he
could
not
hear
them
without
their
making
this
shocking
noise
it
would
appear
to
you
like
the
grossest
blasphemy
were
i
to
repeat
to
you
some
of
their
exclamations
but
one
or
two
were
so
absurdly
ridiculous
that
i
can
not
help
giving
them
as
i
heard
them
one
young
woman
after
lying
foaming
and
writhing
upon
the
ground
like
a
creature
possessed
sprang
up
several
feet
into
the
air
exclaiming
have
got
it
i
have
got
it
i
have
got
it
to
which
others
responded
it
keep
it
keep
it
i
asked
a
bystander
what
she
meant
he
replied
has
got
religion
it
is
the
spirit
that
is
speaking
in
her
i
felt
too
much
shocked
to
laugh
out
yet
could
scarcely
retain
my
gravity
passing
by
one
of
the
tents
i
saw
a
very
fat
woman
lying
upon
a
bench
on
her
face
uttering
the
most
dismal
groans
while
two
ministers
in
rusty
black
coats
and
very
white
chokers
were
drumming
upon
her
fat
back
with
their
fists
exclaiming
glory
here
glory
my
friends
satan
is
departing
out
of
this
woman
hallelujah
this
spectacle
was
too
shocking
to
provoke
a
smile
there
was
a
young
lady
dressed
in
a
very
nice
silk
gown
silk
was
a
very
scarce
and
expensive
article
in
those
days
the
poor
girl
got
dreadfully
excited
and
was
about
to
fling
herself
down
upon
the
wet
grass
to
show
the
depth
of
her
humility
and
contrition
when
she
suddenly
remembered
the
precious
silk
dress
and
taking
a
shawl
of
less
value
from
her
shoulders
carefully
spread
it
over
the
wet
ground
ah
my
dear
friend
continued
the
old
lady
one
had
a
deal
to
learn
at
that
a
number
of
those
people
knew
no
more
what
they
were
about
than
persons
in
a
dream
they
worked
themselves
up
to
a
pitch
of
frenzy
because
they
saw
others
carried
away
by
the
same
spirit
and
they
seemed
to
try
which
could
make
the
most
noise
and
throw
themselves
into
the
most
unnatural
positions
few
of
them
carried
the
religious
zeal
they
manifested
in
such
a
strange
way
at
that
meeting
into
their
own
homes
before
the
party
broke
up
it
was
forgotten
and
they
were
laughing
and
chatting
about
their
worldly
affairs
the
young
lads
were
sparking
the
girls
and
the
girls
laughing
and
flirting
with
them
i
remarked
to
an
old
farmer
who
was
reckoned
a
very
pious
man
such
conduct
in
persons
who
had
just
been
in
a
state
of
despair
about
their
sins
was
very
inconsistent
to
say
the
least
of
it
and
he
replied
with
a
sanctimonious
smile
is
only
the
lord
lambs
playing
with
each
other
these
seldom
take
place
near
large
towns
where
the
people
have
the
benefit
of
a
resident
minister
but
they
still
occur
on
the
borders
of
civilization
and
present
the
same
disorderly
mixture
of
fanaticism
and
vanity
more
persons
go
for
a
frolic
than
to
obtain
any
spiritual
benefit
in
illustration
of
this
i
will
tell
you
a
story
which
a
very
beautiful
young
married
lady
told
to
me
with
much
glee
for
the
thing
happened
to
herself
and
she
was
the
principal
actor
in
the
scene
i
had
an
aunt
the
wife
of
a
very
wealthy
yeoman
who
lived
in
one
of
the
back
townships
of
c
on
the
lawrence
she
was
a
very
pious
and
hospitable
woman
and
none
knew
it
better
than
the
travelling
ministers
who
were
always
well
fed
and
well
lodged
at
her
house
particularly
when
they
assembled
to
hold
a
which
took
place
once
in
several
years
in
that
neighbourhood
i
was
a
girl
of
fifteen
and
was
staying
with
my
aunt
for
the
benefit
of
the
when
one
of
these
great
gatherings
took
place
having
heard
a
great
deal
about
their
strange
doings
at
these
meetings
i
begged
very
hard
to
be
allowed
to
make
one
of
the
spectators
my
aunt
who
knew
what
a
merry
creature
i
was
demurred
for
some
time
before
she
granted
my
request
the
child
does
not
she
said
will
turn
it
all
into
fun
and
it
will
do
her
more
harm
than
good
aunt
was
right
enough
in
her
conjunctures
but
still
she
entertained
a
latent
hope
that
the
zeal
of
the
preachers
the
excitement
of
the
scene
and
the
powerful
influence
produced
by
the
example
of
the
pious
might
have
a
beneficial
effect
on
my
young
mind
and
lead
to
my
conversion
aunt
had
herself
been
reclaimed
from
a
state
of
careless
indifference
by
attending
one
of
these
meetings
and
at
last
it
was
determined
that
i
was
to
go
first
came
the
ministers
and
then
the
grand
feed
my
aunt
had
prepared
for
them
before
they
opened
the
campaign
never
shall
i
forget
how
those
holy
men
devoured
the
good
things
set
before
them
i
stood
gazing
upon
them
in
utter
astonishment
wondering
when
their
meal
would
come
to
an
end
they
none
wore
whiskers
and
their
broad
fat
faces
literally
shone
with
high
feeding
when
i
laughed
at
their
being
such
excellent
knife
and
fork
men
aunt
gravely
reproved
my
levity
by
saying
the
labourer
was
worthy
of
his
hire
and
that
it
would
be
a
great
sin
to
muzzle
the
ox
that
treadeth
out
the
corn
that
field
preaching
was
a
very
exhausting
thing
and
that
these
pious
men
required
a
great
deal
of
nourishment
to
keep
up
their
strength
for
the
performance
of
good
work
after
they
were
gone
i
dressed
and
accompanied
my
aunt
to
the
scene
of
action
it
was
a
lovely
spot
about
a
mile
from
the
house
the
land
rose
in
a
gentle
slope
from
the
river
and
was
surrounded
on
three
sides
by
lofty
woods
the
front
gave
us
a
fine
view
of
the
lawrence
rushing
along
in
its
strength
the
distant
murmur
of
the
waves
mingling
with
the
sigh
of
the
summer
breeze
that
swept
the
dense
foliage
of
the
forest
trees
the
place
had
been
cleared
many
years
before
and
was
quite
free
from
stumps
and
fallen
timber
the
ground
carpeted
with
soft
moss
and
verdant
fresh
looking
turf
the
area
allotted
for
the
meeting
was
fenced
around
with
the
long
thin
trunks
of
sapling
trees
that
were
tied
together
with
strips
of
in
the
centre
of
the
enclosure
was
the
platform
for
the
preachers
constructed
of
rough
slabs
and
directly
behind
this
rural
pulpit
was
a
large
tent
connected
with
it
by
a
flight
of
board
steps
here
the
preachers
retired
after
delivering
their
lectures
to
rest
and
refresh
themselves
fronting
the
platform
was
a
sort
of
amphitheatre
of
booths
constructed
of
branches
of
trees
and
containing
benches
of
boards
supported
at
either
end
by
a
round
log
laid
lengthwise
at
the
sides
of
the
tent
behind
these
rough
benches
persons
had
placed
mattrasses
which
they
had
brought
with
them
in
their
waggons
that
such
as
came
from
a
distance
might
not
want
for
a
bed
during
their
stay
some
of
these
meetings
lasting
over
a
week
the
space
without
the
enclosure
was
occupied
by
a
double
line
of
carts
waggons
light
carriages
and
ox
sleds
while
the
animals
undivested
of
their
harness
were
browsing
peacefully
among
the
trees
the
inner
space
was
crowded
with
persons
of
all
classes
but
the
poorer
certainly
predominated
well
dressed
respectable
people
however
were
not
wanting
and
though
i
came
there
to
see
and
to
be
seen
to
laugh
and
to
make
others
laugh
i
must
confess
that
i
was
greatly
struck
with
the
imposing
and
picturesque
scene
before
me
particularly
when
a
number
of
voices
joined
in
singing
the
hymn
with
which
the
service
commenced
there
is
something
very
touching
in
this
blending
of
human
voices
in
the
open
air
this
choral
song
of
praise
borne
upwards
from
the
earth
and
ascending
through
the
clear
atmosphere
to
heaven
leaving
my
friend
and
her
curious
narrative
for
a
few
minutes
i
must
remark
here
the
powerful
effect
produced
upon
my
mind
by
hearing
god
save
the
king
sung
by
the
thousands
of
london
on
the
proclamation
of
william
iv
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
good
or
bad
voices
in
such
a
mighty
volume
of
sound
which
rolled
through
the
air
like
a
peal
of
solemn
thunder
it
thrilled
through
my
heart
and
paled
my
cheek
it
seemed
to
me
the
united
voice
of
a
whole
nation
rising
to
the
throne
of
god
and
it
was
the
grandest
combination
of
sound
and
sentiment
that
ever
burst
upon
human
ears
long
long
may
that
thrilling
anthem
rise
from
the
heart
of
england
in
strains
of
loyal
thanksgiving
and
praise
to
the
throne
of
that
eternal
potentate
in
whose
hand
is
the
fate
of
princes
there
were
numbers
of
persons
who
like
myself
came
there
for
amusement
and
who
seemed
to
enjoy
themselves
quite
as
much
as
i
did
the
preaching
at
length
commenced
with
a
long
prayer
followed
by
an
admonitory
address
urging
those
present
to
see
their
danger
repent
of
their
sins
and
flee
from
the
wrath
to
come
towards
the
middle
of
his
discourse
the
speaker
wrought
himself
up
into
such
a
religious
fury
that
it
became
infectious
and
cries
and
groans
resounded
on
all
sides
and
the
prayers
poured
out
by
repentant
sinners
for
mercy
and
pardon
were
the
speaker
at
length
became
speechless
from
exhaustion
and
stopping
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
his
too
eloquent
harangue
he
tied
a
red
cotton
handkerchief
round
his
head
and
hastily
descended
the
steps
and
disappeared
in
the
tent
provided
for
the
accommodation
of
the
ministers
his
place
was
instantly
supplied
by
a
tall
dark
melancholy
looking
man
who
improving
upon
his
reverend
brother
suggestions
drew
such
an
awful
picture
of
the
torments
endured
by
the
damned
that
several
women
fainted
while
others
were
shrieking
in
violent
hysterics
i
had
listened
to
the
former
speaker
with
attention
and
respect
but
this
man
violent
denunciations
rather
tended
to
harden
my
heart
and
make
me
resist
any
religious
feeling
that
had
been
growing
up
in
my
breast
i
began
to
tire
of
the
whole
thing
and
commenced
looking
about
for
some
object
that
might
divert
my
thoughts
into
a
less
gloomy
channel
the
bench
on
which
i
together
with
a
number
of
persons
was
sitting
was
so
insecurely
placed
on
the
round
rolling
logs
that
supported
it
that
i
perceived
that
the
least
motion
given
to
it
at
my
end
would
capsize
it
and
bring
all
the
dear
groaning
creatures
who
were
sitting
upon
it
with
their
eyes
turned
up
to
the
preacher
sprawling
on
the
ground
it
not
be
glorious
fun
whispered
the
spirit
of
mischief
perhaps
the
old
one
himself
in
my
ears
can
and
i
do
so
here
goes
as
i
sat
next
to
the
round
log
that
supported
my
end
of
the
plank
i
had
only
to
turn
my
face
that
way
and
apply
my
foot
like
a
lever
to
the
round
trunk
on
which
the
end
of
the
bench
had
the
slightest
possible
hold
and
the
contemplated
downfall
became
a
certainty
no
sooner
thought
than
done
the
next
moment
old
and
young
fat
and
lean
women
and
children
lay
sprawling
together
on
the
ground
in
the
most
original
attitudes
and
picturesque
confusion
i
for
my
part
was
lying
very
comfortably
on
one
of
the
mattrasses
laughing
until
real
tears
but
not
of
contrition
streamed
down
my
face
never
shall
i
forget
a
fat
old
farmer
who
used
to
visit
at
my
aunt
as
he
crawled
out
of
the
human
heap
on
all
fours
and
shook
his
head
at
me
wicked
young
sinner
this
is
all
your
doings
before
the
storm
could
burst
upon
me
i
got
up
and
ran
laughing
out
of
the
tent
and
hid
myself
among
the
trees
to
enjoy
my
wicked
thoughts
alone
here
i
remained
for
a
long
time
watching
at
a
safe
distance
the
mad
gesticulations
of
the
preacher
who
was
capering
up
and
down
on
the
platform
and
using
the
most
violent
and
extravagant
language
until
at
length
overcome
by
his
vehemence
he
too
tied
the
invariable
red
handkerchief
round
his
head
and
tumbled
back
into
the
tent
to
be
succeeded
by
another
and
another
night
with
all
her
stars
was
now
stealing
upon
us
but
the
light
from
a
huge
pile
of
burning
logs
and
from
torches
composed
of
fat
pine
and
stuck
in
iron
grates
supported
on
poles
in
different
parts
of
the
plain
scattered
the
darkness
back
to
the
woods
and
made
it
as
light
as
the
scene
was
now
wild
in
the
extreme
the
red
light
streamed
upon
the
moving
mass
of
human
beings
who
pressed
around
the
pulpit
glaring
upon
clenched
fists
and
upturned
faces
while
the
preacher
standing
above
them
and
thrown
into
strong
relief
with
his
head
held
back
and
his
hands
raised
towards
heaven
looked
like
some
inspired
prophet
of
old
calling
down
fire
from
heaven
to
consume
the
ungodly
it
was
a
spectacle
to
inspire
both
fear
and
awe
but
i
could
only
view
it
in
the
most
absurd
light
and
laugh
at
it
at
length
i
was
determined
to
know
what
became
of
the
preachers
after
tying
the
red
handkerchief
round
their
heads
and
retreating
to
their
tents
i
crept
carefully
round
to
the
back
of
this
holy
of
holies
and
applying
my
eyes
to
a
little
aperture
in
the
canvas
i
saw
by
the
light
of
a
solitary
candle
several
men
lying
upon
mattrasses
fast
asleep
their
noses
making
anything
but
a
musical
response
to
the
hymns
and
prayers
without
while
i
was
gazing
upon
these
prostrate
forms
thus
soundly
sleeping
after
the
hubbub
and
excitement
their
discourse
had
occasioned
among
their
congregation
the
last
speaker
hastily
entered
the
tent
and
flinging
himself
on
to
the
floor
exclaimed
in
a
sort
of
ecstacy
of
gratitude
thank
god
my
task
is
ended
for
the
night
and
now
for
a
good
sleep
while
i
was
yet
pondering
these
things
in
my
heart
i
felt
the
grasp
of
a
hand
upon
my
shoulder
i
turned
with
a
shriek
it
was
my
aunt
seeking
me
are
you
doing
here
she
said
rather
angrily
my
lesson
aunt
said
i
gravely
pointing
to
the
sleepers
these
men
preach
for
their
own
honour
and
glory
or
for
the
glory
of
god
i
have
tried
to
find
out
but
i
ca
tell
night
grown
chilly
child
said
my
aunt
avoiding
the
answer
i
expected
is
time
you
were
in
bed
we
went
home
i
got
a
sound
lecture
for
the
trick
i
had
played
and
i
never
went
to
a
again
yet
in
spite
of
my
bad
conduct
as
a
child
i
believe
they
often
do
good
and
are
the
means
of
making
careless
people
think
of
the
state
of
their
souls
though
the
steamboats
do
not
stop
at
shannonville
they
never
fail
to
do
so
at
the
pretty
town
of
northport
on
the
other
side
of
the
bay
in
order
to
take
in
freight
and
passengers
northport
rises
with
a
very
steep
slope
from
the
water
edge
and
the
steamer
runs
into
the
wharf
which
projects
but
a
few
feet
froth
the
shore
down
the
long
hill
which
leads
to
the
main
street
men
and
boys
are
running
to
catch
a
sight
of
the
steamboat
and
hear
the
news
all
is
bustle
and
confusion
barrels
of
flour
are
being
rolled
into
the
boat
and
sheep
and
cattle
are
led
off
men
hurry
on
board
with
trunks
and
and
women
with
children
in
their
arms
or
led
by
the
hand
hasten
on
board
while
our
passengers
descending
to
the
wharf
are
shaking
hands
with
merchants
and
farmers
and
talking
over
the
current
prices
of
grain
and
merchandise
at
their
respective
towns
the
bell
rings
the
cable
that
bound
us
to
the
friendly
wharf
is
cast
off
and
flung
on
the
deck
the
steamer
opens
her
deep
lungs
and
we
are
once
more
stemming
our
way
towards
kingston
while
we
sail
up
that
romantic
part
of
the
bay
of
quinte
called
the
long
reach
at
the
head
of
which
stands
the
beautiful
town
of
picton
i
will
give
you
a
few
reminiscences
of
northport
it
is
a
most
quiet
and
primitive
village
and
one
might
truly
exclaim
with
moore
and
i
said
if
there
peace
to
be
found
on
the
earth
the
heart
that
is
humble
might
hope
for
it
here
no
gentler
picture
of
society
in
a
new
country
could
be
found
than
the
one
exhibited
by
the
inhabitants
of
northport
the
distinctions
unavoidable
among
persons
of
wealth
and
education
are
hardly
felt
or
recognised
here
every
one
is
a
neighbour
in
the
strictest
sense
of
the
word
and
high
and
low
meet
occasionally
at
each
other
houses
even
the
domestics
are
removed
by
such
a
narrow
line
of
demarcation
that
they
appear
like
members
of
one
family
the
prince
edward
district
one
of
the
wealthiest
rural
districts
in
upper
canada
was
settled
about
sixty
years
ago
by
loyalists
and
its
inhabitants
are
mainly
composed
of
the
descendants
of
dutch
and
american
families
they
have
among
them
a
large
sprinkling
of
quakers
who
are
a
happy
hospitable
community
living
in
peace
and
brotherly
kindness
with
all
men
the
soil
of
this
district
is
of
the
best
quality
for
agricultural
purposes
and
though
the
march
of
improvement
has
been
slow
when
compared
with
the
rapid
advance
of
other
places
that
possessed
fewer
local
advantages
it
has
gone
on
steadily
progressing
and
the
surface
of
a
fine
undulating
country
is
dotted
over
with
large
farms
and
neat
farmhouses
one
of
the
oldest
and
wealthiest
inhabitants
of
northport
captain
is
a
fine
specimen
of
the
old
school
of
canadian
settlers
one
of
nature
gentlemen
a
man
respected
and
beloved
by
all
who
know
him
whose
wise
head
and
keen
organs
of
observation
have
rendered
him
a
highly
intelligent
and
intellectual
man
without
having
received
the
benefit
of
a
college
education
his
house
is
always
open
for
the
reception
of
friends
neighbours
and
strangers
he
has
no
children
of
his
own
but
has
adopted
several
orphan
children
on
whom
he
has
bestowed
all
the
affection
and
care
of
a
real
parent
this
system
of
adopting
children
in
canada
is
one
of
great
benevolence
which
can
not
be
too
highly
eulogized
many
an
orphan
child
who
would
be
cast
utterly
friendless
upon
the
world
finds
a
comfortable
home
with
some
good
neighbour
and
is
treated
with
more
consideration
and
enjoys
greater
privileges
than
if
his
own
parents
had
lived
no
difference
is
made
between
the
adopted
child
and
the
young
ones
of
the
family
it
is
clothed
boarded
and
educated
with
the
same
care
and
a
stranger
would
find
it
difficult
to
determine
which
was
the
real
which
the
transplanted
scion
of
the
house
captain
seldom
dines
alone
some
one
is
always
going
and
coming
stepping
in
and
taking
by
accident
or
invitation
but
the
captain
can
afford
it
sociable
talkative
and
the
soul
of
hospitality
he
entertains
his
guests
like
a
prince
is
he
not
a
glorious
old
fellow
said
our
beloved
and
excellent
robinson
captain
is
a
credit
to
the
country
we
echoed
this
sentiment
with
our
whole
heart
it
is
quite
a
treat
to
make
one
of
his
uninvited
guests
and
share
the
sociability
of
his
bountiful
table
you
meet
there
men
of
all
grades
and
conditions
of
every
party
and
creed
the
clergymen
of
the
establishment
and
the
travelling
dispensers
of
gospel
truths
with
shabbier
coats
and
less
pretensions
no
one
is
deemed
an
intruder
all
find
excellent
cheer
and
a
hearty
welcome
northport
does
not
want
its
native
poet
though
the
merchants
and
farmers
regard
him
with
a
suspicious
and
pitying
eye
the
manner
in
which
they
speak
of
his
unhappy
malady
reminds
me
of
what
an
old
quaker
said
to
me
regarding
his
nephew
bernard
barton
friend
susanna
it
is
a
great
pity
but
my
nephew
bernard
is
sadly
addicted
to
literature
so
isaac
n
gentleman
farmer
of
the
township
of
ameliasburgh
is
sadly
gifted
with
the
genuine
elements
of
poetry
and
like
burns
composes
verses
at
the
i
have
read
with
great
pleasure
some
sweet
lines
by
this
rural
canadian
bard
and
were
he
now
beside
me
instead
of
big
bay
lying
so
provokingly
between
i
would
beg
from
him
a
specimen
of
his
rhyming
powers
just
to
prove
to
my
readers
that
the
genuine
children
of
song
are
distinguished
by
the
same
unmistakeable
characteristics
in
every
clime
i
remember
being
greatly
struck
by
an
overcoat
worn
by
a
clergyman
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
many
years
ago
at
this
village
which
seemed
to
me
a
pretty
good
substitute
for
the
miraculous
purse
of
fortunatus
the
garment
to
which
i
allude
was
long
and
wide
and
cut
round
somewhat
in
the
shape
of
a
spencer
the
inside
lining
formed
one
capacious
pocket
into
which
the
reverend
gentleman
could
conveniently
stow
away
newspapers
books
and
sermons
and
on
a
pinch
a
fat
fowl
a
bottle
of
wine
or
a
homebaked
loaf
of
bread
on
the
present
occasion
the
kind
mistress
of
the
house
took
care
that
the
owner
should
not
travel
with
it
empty
so
to
keep
him
fairly
balanced
on
his
horse
she
stowed
away
into
this
convenient
garment
such
an
assortment
of
good
things
that
i
sat
and
watched
the
operation
in
curious
amazement
some
time
after
i
happened
to
dine
with
a
dissenting
minister
at
hous
the
man
had
a
very
repulsive
and
animal
expression
he
ate
so
long
and
lustily
of
a
very
fat
goose
that
he
began
to
look
very
uncomfortable
and
complained
very
much
of
being
troubled
with
after
his
meals
he
was
a
great
teetotaller
or
professed
to
be
one
but
certainly
had
forgotten
the
text
be
ye
moderate
in
all
things
for
he
by
no
means
applied
the
temperance
system
to
the
substantial
creature
comforts
of
which
he
partook
in
a
most
immoderately
voracious
manner
i
know
what
would
cure
you
r
said
my
friend
who
seemed
to
guess
at
a
glance
the
real
character
of
his
visitor
but
then
i
know
that
you
would
never
consent
to
make
use
of
such
a
remedy
i
would
take
anything
that
would
do
me
good
said
with
a
sigh
what
think
you
of
a
small
of
brandy
just
before
taking
dinner
against
my
principles
sir
it
would
never
do
with
a
lugubrious
shake
of
the
head
there
is
nothing
on
earth
so
good
for
your
complaint
do
you
think
it
would
serve
me
with
a
sudden
twinkle
of
his
heavy
fishy
eyes
not
a
doubt
of
the
fact
pouring
out
a
pretty
large
dram
it
will
kill
the
heartburn
and
do
away
with
that
uncomfortable
feeling
you
experience
after
eating
rich
food
and
as
to
principles
your
pledge
allows
it
in
case
of
disease
true
said
coquetting
with
the
glass
still
i
should
be
sorry
to
try
an
remedy
while
another
could
be
found
perhaps
you
would
prefer
said
my
friend
slyly
which
i
have
been
told
by
a
medical
man
is
generally
a
certain
cure
if
persevered
in
oh
ah
yes
but
sir
my
constitution
would
never
stand
that
i
think
for
i
will
try
the
effect
of
your
first
prescription
but
remember
it
is
only
the
next
moment
the
glass
was
returned
to
the
table
empty
and
the
good
man
took
his
leave
now
was
it
not
too
bad
of
you
to
make
that
man
break
his
pledge
observed
a
person
at
table
my
dear
sir
that
man
requires
very
little
temptation
to
do
that
the
total
abstinence
of
a
glutton
is
entirely
for
the
public
the
houses
built
by
the
dutch
settlers
have
very
little
privacy
as
one
invariably
opens
into
another
in
some
cases
the
sleeping
apartments
all
open
into
a
common
occupied
by
the
family
to
english
people
this
is
both
an
uncomfortable
and
very
unpleasant
arrangement
i
slept
for
two
nights
at
house
with
my
husband
and
our
dormitory
had
no
egress
but
through
another
and
as
that
happened
to
be
occupied
on
the
first
night
by
a
clergyman
i
had
to
wait
for
an
hour
after
my
husband
was
up
and
down
stairs
rejoicing
in
the
fresh
air
of
a
lovely
summer
morning
before
i
could
escape
from
my
chamber
my
neighbour
who
was
young
and
very
comely
taking
a
long
time
for
his
prayers
and
the
business
of
the
toilet
my
husband
laughed
very
heartily
at
my
imprisonment
as
he
termed
it
but
the
next
day
i
had
the
laugh
against
him
for
our
sleeping
neighbours
happened
to
be
a
quaker
with
a
very
sickly
delicate
wife
i
of
course
was
forced
to
go
to
bed
when
she
did
or
be
obliged
to
pass
through
her
chamber
after
brother
jonathan
had
retired
for
the
night
this
being
by
no
means
desirable
i
left
a
very
interesting
argument
in
which
my
husband
the
quaker
and
the
poet
were
fighting
an
animated
battle
on
reform
principles
against
the
clergyman
and
my
very
much
respected
tory
host
how
they
got
on
i
do
know
for
the
debate
was
at
its
height
when
i
was
obliged
to
beat
my
retreat
to
bed
after
an
hour
or
so
i
heard
jonathan
tumble
upstairs
to
bed
and
while
undressing
he
made
the
following
very
innocent
remark
to
his
wife
truly
hannah
i
fear
that
i
have
used
too
many
words
tonight
my
uncle
is
a
man
of
many
words
and
one
is
apt
to
forget
the
rules
of
prudence
when
arguing
with
him
if
the
use
of
many
words
was
looked
upon
as
a
serious
transgression
by
honest
jonathan
my
husband
my
friend
and
the
poet
must
have
been
very
guilty
men
for
they
continued
their
argument
until
the
sma
hours
ayont
the
twal
my
husband
had
to
pass
through
the
room
occupied
by
the
friends
in
order
to
reach
mine
but
he
put
a
bold
face
upon
the
matter
and
plunged
at
once
through
the
difficulty
the
quaker
nose
giving
unmistakeable
notice
that
he
was
in
the
land
of
nod
the
pale
sickly
woman
just
opened
her
dreamy
black
eyes
but
hid
them
instantly
beneath
the
and
the
passage
not
of
arms
but
of
the
was
won
the
next
morning
we
had
to
rise
early
to
take
the
boat
and
jonathan
was
up
by
the
dawn
of
day
so
that
i
went
through
as
bold
as
a
lion
and
was
busily
employed
in
discussing
an
excellent
breakfast
while
my
poor
partner
was
sitting
impatiently
nursing
his
appetite
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
and
wishing
the
pale
quakeress
across
the
bay
the
steamer
was
in
sight
before
he
was
able
to
join
us
at
the
i
had
now
my
revenge
and
teased
him
all
the
way
home
on
being
kept
a
prisoner
with
only
a
sickly
woman
for
a
jailor
a
young
lady
gave
me
an
account
of
a
funeral
she
witnessed
in
this
primitive
village
which
may
not
be
uninteresting
to
my
english
readers
as
a
picture
of
some
of
the
customs
of
a
new
country
the
deceased
was
an
old
and
very
respectable
resident
in
the
township
and
as
the
canadians
delight
in
large
funerals
he
was
followed
to
his
last
home
by
nearly
all
the
residents
for
miles
round
the
use
of
the
hearse
is
not
known
in
rural
districts
and
indeed
is
seldom
used
in
towns
or
cities
here
the
corpse
is
generally
carried
to
the
grave
the
bearers
being
chosen
from
among
the
gentlemen
of
most
note
in
the
neighbourhood
who
to
the
honour
of
the
country
be
it
spoken
never
refuse
to
act
on
these
mournful
occasions
these
walking
funerals
are
far
more
imposing
and
affecting
spectacles
than
the
hearse
with
its
funeral
plumes
and
the
simple
fact
of
friends
and
neighbours
conveying
a
departed
brother
to
his
long
home
has
a
more
solemn
and
touching
effect
upon
the
mind
than
the
train
of
hired
mourners
and
empty
when
a
body
is
brought
from
a
distance
for
interment
it
is
conveyed
in
a
waggon
if
in
summer
spring
or
autumn
and
on
a
sleigh
during
the
winter
season
and
is
attended
to
the
grave
by
all
the
respectable
yeomen
in
the
township
i
can
not
resist
the
strong
temptation
of
digressing
from
my
present
subject
in
order
to
relate
a
very
affecting
instance
i
witnessed
at
one
of
these
funerals
of
the
attachment
of
a
dog
to
his
deceased
master
which
drew
tears
from
my
eyes
and
from
the
eyes
of
my
children
the
body
of
a
farmer
had
been
brought
in
a
waggon
from
one
of
the
back
townships
a
distance
of
twenty
or
thirty
miles
and
was
as
usual
in
such
cases
attended
by
a
long
train
of
country
equipages
my
house
fronted
the
churchyard
and
from
the
windows
you
could
witness
the
whole
of
the
funeral
ceremonial
and
hear
the
service
pronounced
over
the
grave
when
the
coffin
was
lifted
by
the
stalwart
sons
of
the
deceased
from
the
waggon
and
the
procession
formed
to
carry
it
into
the
church
i
observed
a
large
buff
flemish
dog
fall
into
the
ranks
of
the
mourners
and
follow
them
into
the
sacred
edifice
keeping
as
near
the
coffin
as
those
about
it
would
permit
him
after
the
service
in
the
church
was
ended
the
creature
persevered
in
following
the
beloved
remains
to
the
grave
when
the
crowd
dispersed
the
faithful
animal
retired
to
some
distance
and
laid
himself
quietly
down
upon
a
grave
until
the
sexton
had
finished
his
mournful
task
and
the
last
sod
was
placed
upon
the
fresh
heap
that
had
closed
for
ever
over
the
form
he
loved
when
the
man
retired
the
dog
proceeded
to
the
spot
walked
carefully
round
it
smelt
the
earth
lifted
his
head
and
uttered
the
most
unearthly
howls
he
then
endeavoured
to
disinter
the
body
by
digging
a
large
hole
at
one
end
of
the
grave
but
finding
that
he
could
not
effect
his
purpose
he
stretched
himself
at
full
length
over
it
as
if
to
guard
the
spot
with
his
head
buried
between
his
his
whole
appearance
betokening
the
most
intense
dejection
all
that
day
and
night
and
the
next
day
and
night
he
never
quitted
his
post
for
an
instant
at
intervals
smelling
the
earth
and
uttering
those
mournful
cries
my
boys
took
him
bread
and
meat
and
tried
to
coax
him
from
the
grave
but
he
rejected
the
food
and
their
caresses
the
creature
appeared
wasted
and
heartbroken
with
grief
towards
noon
of
the
third
day
the
eldest
son
of
his
late
master
came
in
search
of
him
and
the
young
man
seemed
deeply
affected
by
this
instance
of
the
dog
attachment
to
his
father
even
his
voice
failed
to
entice
him
from
the
grave
and
he
was
obliged
to
bring
a
collar
and
chain
and
lift
him
by
force
into
his
waggon
to
get
him
from
his
post
oh
human
love
is
thy
memory
and
thy
faith
greater
than
the
attachment
of
this
poor
and
as
we
term
him
unreasoning
brute
to
his
dead
master
his
grief
made
an
impression
on
my
mind
and
on
that
of
my
children
which
will
never
be
forgotten
but
to
return
to
the
village
funeral
the
body
in
this
case
was
borne
to
the
church
by
the
near
relatives
of
the
deceased
and
a
clergyman
of
the
establishment
delivered
a
funeral
sermon
in
which
he
enumerated
the
good
qualities
of
the
departed
his
long
residence
among
them
and
described
the
trials
and
hardships
he
had
encountered
as
a
first
settler
in
that
district
while
it
was
yet
in
the
wilderness
he
extolled
his
conduct
as
a
good
citizen
and
faithful
christian
and
a
man
his
sermon
was
a
very
complete
piece
of
rural
biography
very
curious
and
graphic
in
its
way
and
was
listened
to
with
the
deepest
attention
by
the
persons
assembled
when
the
discourse
was
concluded
and
the
blessing
pronounced
one
of
the
sons
of
the
deceased
rose
and
informed
the
persons
present
that
if
any
one
wished
to
take
a
last
look
of
the
dear
old
man
now
was
the
time
he
then
led
the
way
to
the
aisle
in
which
the
coffin
stood
upon
the
tressels
and
opening
a
small
lid
in
the
top
revealed
to
the
astonishment
of
my
young
friend
the
pale
ghastly
face
of
the
dead
almost
every
person
present
touched
either
the
face
hands
or
brow
of
the
deceased
and
after
their
curiosity
had
been
fully
satisfied
the
procession
followed
the
remains
to
their
last
this
part
of
the
ceremony
concluded
the
indifferent
spectators
dispersed
to
their
respective
homes
while
the
friends
and
relations
of
the
dead
man
returned
to
dine
at
the
house
of
one
of
his
sons
my
friend
making
one
of
the
party
in
solemn
state
the
mourners
discussed
the
merits
of
an
excellent
dinner
the
important
business
of
eating
being
occasionally
interrupted
by
remarks
upon
the
appearance
of
the
corpse
his
age
the
disease
of
which
he
died
the
probable
division
of
his
property
and
the
merits
of
the
funeral
discourse
this
was
done
in
such
a
manner
that
my
friend
was
astonished
how
the
blood
relations
of
the
deceased
could
join
in
these
remarks
after
the
great
business
of
eating
was
concluded
the
spirits
of
the
party
began
to
flag
the
master
of
the
house
perceiving
how
matters
were
going
left
the
room
and
soon
returned
with
a
servant
bearing
a
tray
with
plates
and
fork
and
a
large
dish
of
hiccory
nuts
the
mourners
dried
their
tears
and
set
seriously
to
work
to
discuss
the
nuts
and
while
deeply
engaged
with
their
employment
forgot
for
awhile
their
sorrow
for
the
dead
continuing
to
keep
up
their
spirits
until
the
announcement
of
tea
turned
their
thoughts
into
a
new
channel
by
the
time
all
the
rich
pies
cakes
and
preserves
were
eaten
their
feelings
seemed
to
have
subsided
into
their
accustomed
everyday
routine
it
is
certain
that
death
is
looked
upon
by
many
canadians
more
as
a
matter
of
business
and
a
change
of
property
into
other
hands
than
as
a
real
domestic
calamity
i
have
heard
people
talk
of
the
approaching
dissolution
of
their
nearest
ties
with
a
calm
philosophy
which
i
never
could
comprehend
mother
is
old
and
delicate
we
ca
expect
her
to
last
long
says
one
my
brother
death
has
been
looked
for
these
several
months
past
you
know
he
in
the
consumption
my
husband
asked
the
son
of
a
respectable
farmer
for
whom
he
entertained
an
esteem
how
his
father
was
for
he
had
not
seen
him
for
some
time
i
guess
was
the
reply
that
the
old
man
fixing
for
the
other
world
another
young
man
being
asked
by
my
friend
captain
to
spend
the
evening
at
his
house
replied
no
ca
much
obliged
but
i
that
grandfather
will
give
the
last
kicks
while
i
away
canadians
flock
in
crowds
to
visit
the
dying
and
to
gaze
upon
the
dead
a
doctor
told
me
that
being
called
into
the
country
to
visit
a
very
sick
man
he
was
surprised
on
finding
the
wife
of
his
patient
sitting
alone
before
the
fire
ill
the
lower
room
smoking
a
pipe
he
naturally
inquired
if
her
husband
was
better
oh
no
sir
far
from
that
he
is
dying
dying
and
here
i
ca
help
that
sir
the
room
is
so
crowded
with
the
neighbours
that
i
ca
get
in
to
wait
upon
him
follow
me
said
the
doctor
i
soon
make
a
clearance
for
you
on
ascending
the
stairs
that
led
to
the
apartment
of
the
sick
man
he
found
them
crowded
with
people
struggling
to
get
in
to
take
a
peep
at
the
poor
man
it
was
only
by
telling
them
that
he
was
the
doctor
that
he
forced
his
way
to
the
bedside
he
found
his
patient
in
a
high
fever
greatly
augmented
by
the
bustle
confusion
and
heat
occasioned
by
so
many
people
round
him
with
great
difficulty
he
cleared
the
room
of
these
intruders
and
told
the
brother
of
his
patient
to
keep
every
one
but
the
sick
man
wife
out
of
the
house
the
brother
followed
the
doctor
advice
and
the
man
cheated
the
curiosity
of
the
and
recovered
the
canadians
spend
a
great
deal
of
money
upon
their
dead
an
old
lady
told
me
that
her
nephew
a
very
large
farmer
who
had
the
misfortune
to
lose
his
wife
in
childbed
had
laid
out
a
great
deal
of
money
a
little
fortune
she
termed
it
on
her
oh
my
dear
she
said
it
is
a
thousand
pities
that
you
did
not
go
and
see
her
before
she
was
buried
she
was
dressed
so
expensively
and
she
made
such
a
beautiful
corpse
her
cap
was
of
real
thread
lace
trimmed
with
white
french
ribbons
and
her
linen
the
finest
that
could
be
bought
in
the
country
the
more
ostentatious
the
display
of
grief
for
the
dead
the
less
i
have
always
found
of
the
reality
i
heard
two
young
ladies
who
had
recently
lost
a
mother
not
more
than
sixteen
years
older
than
the
eldest
of
the
twain
lamenting
most
pathetically
that
they
could
not
go
to
a
public
ball
because
they
were
in
mourning
for
ma
oh
what
a
pitiful
farce
is
this
of
wearing
mourning
for
the
dead
but
as
i
have
a
good
deal
to
say
to
sensible
people
on
that
subject
i
will
defer
my

wearing
mourning
for
the
dead
what
is
death
my
sister
say
ask
not
brother
breathing
clay
ask
the
earth
on
which
we
tread
that
silent
empire
of
the
dead
ask
the
sea
its
myriad
waves
living
leap
countless
graves
earth
and
ocean
answer
not
life
is
in
their
depths
forgot
ask
yon
pale
extended
form
unconscious
of
the
coming
storm
that
breathed
and
spake
an
hour
ago
of
heavenly
bliss
and
penal
woe
within
yon
shrouded
figure
lies
the
mystery
of
mysteries
among
the
many
absurd
customs
that
the
sanction
of
time
and
the
arbitrary
laws
of
society
have
rendered
indispensable
there
is
not
one
that
is
so
much
abused
and
to
which
mankind
so
fondly
clings
as
that
of
mourning
for
the
dead
from
the
ostentatious
public
mourning
appointed
by
governments
for
the
loss
of
their
rulers
down
to
the
plain
black
badge
worn
by
the
humblest
peasant
for
the
death
of
parent
or
child
to
attempt
to
raise
one
feeble
voice
against
a
practice
sanctioned
by
all
nations
and
hallowed
by
the
most
solemn
religious
rites
appears
almost
sacrilegious
there
is
something
so
beautiful
so
poetical
so
sacred
in
this
outward
sign
of
a
deep
and
heartfelt
sorrow
that
to
deprive
death
of
his
sable
habiliments
the
melancholy
hearse
funeral
plumes
sombre
pall
and
a
long
array
of
drooping
mourners
together
with
the
awful
clangour
of
the
doleful
bell
would
rob
the
stern
necessity
of
our
nature
of
half
its
terrors
and
tend
greatly
to
destroy
that
religious
dread
which
is
so
imposing
and
which
affords
such
a
solemn
lesson
to
the
living
alas
where
is
the
need
of
all
this
black
parade
is
it
not
a
reproach
to
him
who
in
his
wisdom
appointed
death
to
pass
upon
all
men
were
the
sentence
confined
to
the
human
species
we
might
have
more
reason
for
these
extravagant
demonstrations
of
grief
but
in
every
object
around
us
we
see
inscribed
the
mysterious
law
of
change
the
very
mountains
crumble
and
decay
with
years
the
great
sea
shrinks
and
grows
again
the
lofty
forest
tree
that
has
drank
the
dews
of
heaven
laughed
in
the
sunlight
and
shook
its
branches
at
a
thousand
storms
yields
to
the
same
inscrutable
destiny
and
bows
its
tall
forehead
to
the
dust
life
lives
upon
death
and
death
reproduces
life
through
endless
circles
of
being
from
the
proud
tyrant
man
down
to
the
blind
worm
his
iron
heel
tramples
in
the
earth
then
wherefore
should
we
hang
out
this
black
banner
for
those
who
are
beyond
the
laws
of
change
and
chance
yea
they
have
finish
for
them
there
is
no
longer
any
future
no
evil
hour
knocks
at
their
door
with
tidings
of
mishap
far
off
are
they
beyond
desire
or
fear
it
is
the
dismal
adjuncts
of
death
which
have
invested
it
with
those
superstitious
terrors
that
we
would
fain
see
removed
the
gloom
arising
from
these
melancholy
pageants
forms
a
black
cloud
whose
dense
shadow
obscures
the
light
of
life
to
the
living
and
why
we
ask
should
death
be
invested
with
such
horror
death
in
itself
is
not
dreadful
it
is
but
the
change
of
one
mode
of
being
for
another
the
breaking
forth
of
the
winged
soul
from
its
earthly
chrysalis
or
as
an
old
latin
poet
has
so
happily
described
it
thus
life
for
ever
runs
its
endless
race
death
as
a
line
which
but
divides
the
space
a
stop
which
can
but
for
a
moment
last
a
between
the
and
the
nature
presents
in
all
her
laws
such
a
beautiful
and
wonderful
harmony
that
it
is
as
impossible
for
death
to
produce
discord
among
them
as
for
night
to
destroy
by
the
intervention
of
its
shadow
the
splendour
of
the
coming
day
were
men
taught
from
infancy
to
regard
death
as
a
natural
consequence
a
fixed
law
of
their
being
instead
as
an
awful
pumshment
for
sin
as
the
friend
and
benefactor
of
mankind
not
the
remorseless
tyrant
and
persecutor
to
die
would
no
longer
be
considered
an
evil
let
this
hideous
skeleton
be
banished
into
darkness
and
replaced
by
a
benignant
angel
wiping
away
all
tears
healing
all
pain
burying
in
oblivion
all
sorrow
and
care
calming
every
turbulent
passion
and
restoring
man
reconciled
to
his
maker
to
a
state
of
purity
and
peace
young
and
old
would
then
go
forth
to
meet
him
with
lighted
torches
and
hail
his
approach
with
songs
of
thanksgiving
and
welcome
and
this
is
really
the
case
with
all
but
the
desperately
wicked
who
show
that
they
despise
the
magnificent
boon
of
life
by
the
bad
use
they
make
of
it
by
their
blasphemous
defiance
of
god
and
good
and
their
unwillingness
to
be
renewed
in
his
image
the
death
angel
is
generally
met
with
more
calmness
by
the
dying
than
by
surviving
friends
by
the
former
the
dreaded
enemy
is
hailed
as
a
messenger
of
peace
and
they
sink
tranquilly
into
his
arms
with
a
smile
upon
their
lips
the
death
of
the
christian
is
a
beautiful
triumph
over
the
fears
of
life
in
him
who
conquered
death
and
led
captivity
captive
he
finds
the
fruition
of
his
being
the
eternal
blessedness
promised
to
him
in
the
gospel
which
places
him
beyond
the
wants
and
woes
of
time
the
death
of
such
a
man
should
be
celebrated
as
a
sacred
festival
not
lamented
as
a
dreary
execution
as
the
era
of
a
new
birth
not
the
extinction
of
being
it
is
true
that
death
is
a
profound
sleep
from
which
no
one
can
awaken
to
tell
his
dreams
but
why
on
that
account
should
we
doubt
that
it
is
less
blessed
than
its
twin
brother
whose
resemblance
it
bears
and
whose
presence
we
all
sedulously
court
invest
sleep
however
with
the
same
dismal
garb
let
your
bed
be
a
coffin
your
canopy
a
pall
your
a
shroud
let
the
sobs
of
mourners
and
the
tolling
of
bells
lull
you
to
repose
and
few
persons
would
willingly
or
tranquilly
close
their
eyes
to
sleep
and
then
this
absurd
fashion
of
wearing
black
for
months
and
years
for
the
dead
let
us
calmly
consider
the
philosophy
of
the
thing
its
use
and
abuse
does
it
confer
any
benefit
on
the
dead
does
it
afford
any
consolation
to
the
living
morally
or
physically
does
it
produce
the
least
good
does
it
soften
one
regretful
pang
or
dry
one
bitter
tear
or
make
the
wearers
wiser
or
better
if
it
does
not
produce
any
ultimate
benefit
it
should
be
at
once
discarded
as
a
superstitious
relic
of
more
barbarous
times
when
men
could
not
gaze
on
the
simple
unveiled
face
of
truth
but
obscured
the
clear
daylight
of
her
glance
under
a
thousand
fantastic
masks
the
ancients
were
more
consistent
in
their
mourning
than
the
civilized
people
of
the
present
day
they
sat
upon
the
ground
and
fasted
with
rent
garments
and
ashes
strewn
upon
their
heads
this
mortification
of
the
flesh
was
a
sort
of
penance
inflicted
by
the
mourner
for
his
own
sins
and
those
of
the
dead
if
this
grief
were
not
of
a
deep
or
lasting
nature
the
mourner
found
relief
for
his
mental
agonies
in
humiliation
and
personal
suffering
he
did
not
array
himself
in
silk
and
wool
and
fine
linen
and
garments
cut
in
the
most
approved
fashion
of
the
day
like
our
modern
beaux
and
belles
when
they
testify
to
the
public
their
grief
for
the
loss
of
relation
or
friend
in
the
most
expensive
and
becoming
manner
verily
if
we
must
wear
our
sorrow
upon
our
sleeve
why
not
return
to
the
sackcloth
and
ashes
as
the
most
consistent
demonstration
of
that
grief
which
hidden
in
the
heart
surpasseth
show
but
then
sackcloth
is
a
most
unmanageable
material
a
handsome
figure
would
be
lost
buried
annihilated
in
a
sackcloth
gown
it
would
be
so
horribly
rough
it
would
wound
the
delicate
skin
of
a
fine
lady
it
could
not
be
confined
in
graceful
folds
by
clasps
of
jet
and
pearl
and
ornaments
in
black
and
gold
sackcloth
faugh
away
with
it
it
smells
of
the
knotted
scourge
and
the
we
say
away
with
it
true
grief
has
no
need
of
such
miserable
provocatives
to
woe
the
barbarians
who
cut
and
disfigured
their
faces
for
the
dead
showed
a
noble
contempt
of
the
world
by
destroying
those
personal
attractions
which
the
loss
of
the
beloved
had
taught
them
to
despise
but
who
now
would
have
the
fortitude
and
to
imitate
such
an
example
the
mourners
in
crape
and
silk
and
french
merino
would
rather
than
sacrifice
their
beauty
at
the
shrine
of
such
a
monstrous
sorrow
how
often
have
i
heard
a
knot
of
gossips
exclaim
as
some
widow
of
a
gentleman
in
fallen
circumstances
glided
by
in
her
rusty
weeds
what
shabby
black
that
woman
wears
for
her
husband
i
should
be
ashamed
to
appear
in
public
in
such
faded
mourning
and
yet
the
purchase
of
that
may
have
cost
the
desolate
mourner
and
her
orphan
children
the
price
of
many
a
necessary
meal
ah
this
putting
of
a
poor
family
into
black
and
all
the
funeral
trappings
for
pallbearers
and
mourners
what
a
terrible
affair
it
is
what
anxious
thoughts
what
bitter
heartaches
it
costs
but
the
usages
of
society
demand
the
sacrifice
and
it
must
be
made
the
head
of
the
family
has
suddenly
been
removed
from
his
earthly
toils
at
a
most
complicated
crisis
of
his
affairs
which
are
so
involved
that
scarcely
enough
can
be
collected
to
pay
the
expenses
of
the
funeral
and
put
his
family
into
decent
mourning
but
every
exertion
must
be
made
to
do
this
the
money
that
might
after
the
funeral
was
over
have
paid
the
rent
of
a
small
house
and
secured
the
widow
and
her
young
family
from
actual
want
until
she
could
look
around
and
obtain
some
situation
in
which
she
could
earn
a
living
for
herself
and
them
must
all
be
sunk
in
conforming
to
a
useless
custom
upheld
by
pride
and
vanity
in
the
name
of
grief
how
will
the
funeral
expenses
ever
be
paid
exclaims
the
anxious
weeping
mother
when
it
is
all
over
and
the
mourning
bought
there
will
not
remain
a
single
copper
to
find
us
in
bread
the
sorrow
of
obtaining
this
useless
outward
show
of
grief
engrosses
all
the
available
means
of
the
family
and
that
is
expended
upon
the
dead
which
might
with
careful
management
have
kept
the
living
from
starving
oh
vanity
of
vanities
there
is
no
folly
on
earth
that
exceeds
the
vanity
of
this
there
are
many
persons
who
put
off
their
grief
when
they
put
on
their
mourning
and
it
is
a
miserable
satire
on
mankind
to
see
these
beings
in
festal
halls
mingling
with
the
gay
and
happy
their
melancholy
garments
affording
a
painful
contrast
to
light
laughter
and
eyes
sparkling
with
pleasure
their
levity
however
must
not
be
mistaken
for
hypocrisy
the
world
is
in
fault
not
they
their
grief
is
already
over
gone
like
a
cloud
from
before
the
sun
but
they
are
forced
to
wear
black
for
a
they
are
true
to
their
nature
which
teaches
them
that
no
grief
with
man
is
permanent
that
the
storms
of
will
not
darken
the
heavens
it
is
complying
with
a
makes
them
and
as
the
world
always
judges
by
appearances
it
so
happens
that
by
adhering
to
one
of
its
conventional
rules
appearances
in
this
instance
are
against
them
nay
the
very
persons
who
in
the
first
genuine
outburst
of
natural
grief
besought
them
to
moderate
their
sorrow
to
dry
their
tears
and
be
comforted
for
the
loss
they
had
sustained
are
among
the
to
censure
them
for
following
advice
so
common
and
useless
tears
are
as
necessary
to
the
afflicted
as
showers
are
to
the
parched
earth
and
are
the
best
and
sweetest
remedy
for
excessive
grief
to
the
mourner
we
would
say
weep
on
nature
requires
your
tears
they
are
sent
in
mercy
by
him
who
wept
at
the
grave
of
his
friend
lazarus
the
man
of
sorrows
himself
taught
us
to
weep
we
once
heard
a
very
beautiful
volatile
young
lady
exclaim
with
something
very
like
glee
in
her
look
and
tone
after
reading
a
letter
she
had
received
by
the
post
with
its
ominous
black
bordering
and
seal
grandmamma
is
dead
we
shall
have
to
go
into
deep
mourning
i
am
so
glad
for
black
is
so
becoming
to
me
an
old
aunt
who
was
present
expressed
her
surprise
at
this
indecorous
avowal
when
the
young
lady
replied
with
great
i
never
saw
grandmamma
in
my
life
i
can
not
be
expected
to
feel
any
grief
for
her
death
perhaps
not
said
the
aunt
but
why
then
make
a
show
of
that
which
you
do
not
feel
oh
it
the
custom
of
the
world
you
know
we
must
it
would
be
considered
not
to
go
into
very
mourning
for
such
a
near
relation
the
young
lady
inherited
a
very
nice
legacy
too
from
her
grandmamma
and
had
she
spoken
the
truth
she
would
have
said
i
can
not
weep
for
joy
her
mourning
in
consequence
was
of
the
deepest
and
most
expensive
kind
and
she
really
did
look
charming
in
her
love
of
a
black
crape
bonnet
as
she
skipped
before
the
glass
admiring
herself
and
it
when
it
came
home
fresh
from
the
milliner
in
contrast
to
the
pretty
young
heiress
we
knew
a
sweet
orphan
girl
whose
grief
for
the
death
of
her
mother
to
whom
she
was
devotedly
attached
lay
deeper
than
this
hollow
tinsel
show
and
yet
the
painful
thought
that
she
was
too
poor
to
pay
this
mark
of
respect
to
the
memory
of
her
beloved
parent
in
a
manner
suited
to
her
birth
and
station
added
greatly
to
the
poignancy
of
her
sorrow
a
family
who
had
long
been
burthened
with
a
cross
old
aunt
who
was
a
martyr
to
rheumatic
gout
and
whose
violent
temper
kept
the
whole
house
in
awe
and
whom
they
dared
not
offend
for
fear
of
her
leaving
her
wealth
to
strangers
were
in
the
habit
of
devoutly
wishing
the
old
lady
a
happy
release
from
her
sufferings
when
this
long
anticipated
event
at
length
took
place
the
very
servants
were
put
into
the
deepest
mourning
what
a
solemn
farce
we
should
say
lie
was
this
the
daughters
of
a
wealthy
farmer
had
prepared
everything
to
attend
the
great
agricultural
provincial
show
unfortunately
a
grandfather
to
whom
they
all
seemed
greatly
attached
died
most
inconveniently
the
day
before
and
as
they
seldom
keep
a
body
in
canada
over
the
second
day
he
was
buried
early
in
the
morning
of
the
one
appointed
for
their
journey
they
attended
the
remains
to
the
grave
but
after
the
funeral
was
over
they
put
off
their
black
garments
and
started
for
the
show
and
did
not
resume
them
again
until
after
their
return
people
may
think
this
very
shocking
but
it
was
not
the
laying
aside
the
black
that
was
so
but
the
fact
of
their
being
able
to
go
from
a
grave
to
a
scene
of
confusion
and
gaiety
the
black
clothes
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
want
of
feeling
which
would
have
remained
the
same
under
a
black
or
a
scarlet
vestment
a
gentleman
in
this
neighbourhood
since
dead
who
attended
a
public
ball
the
same
week
that
he
had
seen
a
lovely
child
consigned
to
the
earth
would
have
remained
the
same
heartless
parent
dressed
in
the
deepest
sables
no
instance
that
i
have
narrated
of
the
manner
in
which
canadians
treat
death
is
more
ridiculously
striking
than
the
following
the
wife
of
a
rich
mechanic
had
a
brother
lying
it
was
supposed
at
the
point
of
death
his
sister
sent
a
note
to
me
requesting
me
to
relinquish
an
engagement
i
had
made
with
a
sewing
girl
in
her
favour
as
she
wanted
her
immediately
to
make
up
her
mourning
the
doctor
having
told
her
that
her
brother
could
not
live
many
days
is
going
to
be
beforehand
with
death
i
said
as
i
gave
the
girl
the
desired
release
i
have
known
instances
of
persons
being
too
late
with
their
mourning
to
attend
a
funeral
but
this
is
the
first
time
i
ever
heard
of
it
being
made
in
anticipation
after
a
week
the
girl
returned
to
her
former
employment
well
anne
is
dead
no
nor
likely
to
die
this
time
and
his
sister
is
so
vexed
that
she
bought
such
expensive
mourning
and
all
for
no
purpose
the
brother
of
this
provident
lady
is
alive
to
this
day
the
husband
of
a
very
pretty
wife
and
the
father
of
a
family
while
she
poor
body
has
been
consigned
to
the
grave
for
more
than
three
years
during
her
own
dying
illness
a
little
girl
greatly
disturbed
her
sick
mother
with
the
noise
she
made
her
husband
as
an
inducement
to
keep
the
child
quiet
said
mary
if
you
do
not
quit
that
i
whip
you
but
if
you
keep
still
like
a
good
girl
you
shall
go
to
ma
funeral
an
artist
cousin
of
mine
was
invited
with
many
other
members
of
the
royal
academy
to
attend
the
funeral
of
the
celebrated
nollekens
the
sculptor
the
party
filled
twelve
mourning
coaches
and
were
furnished
with
silk
gloves
scarfs
and
hatbands
and
a
dinner
was
provided
after
the
funeral
was
over
at
one
of
the
large
hotels
a
merrier
set
than
we
were
on
that
day
said
my
cousin
i
never
saw
we
all
got
jovial
and
it
was
midnight
before
any
of
us
reached
our
respective
homes
the
whole
affair
vividly
brought
to
my
mind
that
description
of
the
given
so
graphically
by
byron
that
it
much
fun
like
mourning
coaches
when
the
funeral
done
some
years
ago
i
witnessed
the
funeral
of
a
young
lady
the
only
child
of
very
wealthy
parents
who
resided
in
of
the
heiress
of
their
enviable
riches
was
a
very
delicate
girl
and
on
the
day
that
she
attained
her
majority
her
parents
gave
a
large
dinner
party
followed
by
a
ball
in
the
evening
to
celebrate
the
event
it
was
during
the
winter
the
night
was
very
cold
the
crowded
rooms
overheated
the
young
lady
thinly
but
magnificently
clad
she
took
a
chill
in
leaving
the
close
ballroom
for
the
large
and
three
days
after
the
hope
of
these
rich
people
lay
insensible
on
her
bier
i
heard
from
every
one
that
called
upon
l
the
relative
and
friend
with
whom
i
was
staying
of
the
magnificent
funeral
would
be
given
to
miss
c
ah
little
heeded
that
pale
crushed
flower
of
yesterday
the
pomp
that
was
to
convey
her
from
the
of
luxury
to
the
cold
damp
vault
of
giles
melancholy
looking
church
i
stood
at
l
window
which
commanded
a
view
of
the
whole
square
to
watch
the
procession
pass
up
to
the
place
of
interment
the
morning
was
intensely
cold
and
large
fell
lazily
and
heavily
to
the
earth
the
poor
dingy
sparrows
with
their
feathers
ruffled
up
hopped
mournfully
along
the
pavement
in
search
of
food
they
in
spite
of
all
their
feathers
were
the
mutes
that
attended
the
long
line
of
mourning
coaches
stood
motionless
leaning
on
their
long
staffs
wreathed
with
white
like
so
many
figures
that
the
had
stiffened
into
stone
the
hearse
with
its
snowy
plumes
drawn
by
six
horses
might
have
served
for
the
regal
car
of
his
northern
majesty
so
and
chilly
were
its
sepulchral
trappings
at
length
the
coffin
covered
with
black
velvet
and
a
pall
lined
with
white
silk
and
fringed
with
silver
was
borne
from
the
house
and
deposited
in
the
gloomy
depths
of
the
stately
hearse
the
mourners
in
their
sable
dresses
and
long
white
hatbands
and
scarfs
rode
slowly
forward
mounted
on
white
horses
to
attend
this
bride
of
death
to
her
last
resting
place
the
first
three
carriages
that
followed
contained
the
family
physician
and
surgeon
a
clergyman
and
the
male
servants
of
the
house
in
deep
sables
the
family
carriage
too
was
there
but
and
of
a
procession
in
which
private
carriages
made
a
conspicuous
show
all
but
those
enumerated
above
were
strangers
drove
strange
horses
to
that
vast
funeral
and
were
the
only
members
of
the
family
that
conducted
the
last
scion
of
that
family
to
the
grave
truly
it
was
the
most
dismal
spectacle
we
ever
witnessed
and
we
turned
from
it
sick
at
heart
and
with
eyes
moist
with
tears
not
shed
for
the
dead
for
she
had
escaped
from
this
vexatious
vanity
but
from
the
heartless
mockery
of
all
this
fictitious
woe
the
expense
of
such
a
funeral
probably
involved
many
hundred
pounds
which
had
been
better
bestowed
on
charitable
purposes
another
evil
arising
out
of
this
absurd
custom
is
the
high
price
attached
to
black
clothing
on
account
of
the
necessity
that
compels
people
to
wear
it
for
so
long
a
period
after
the
death
of
a
near
relation
making
it
a
matter
of
still
greater
difficulty
for
the
poorer
class
to
comply
with
the
usages
of
society
but
who
cares
about
the
poor
whether
they
go
into
mourning
for
their
friends
or
no
it
is
a
matter
of
no
consequence
ah
there
it
is
and
this
is
not
the
least
forcible
argument
we
have
to
advance
against
this
useless
custom
if
it
becomes
a
moral
duty
for
the
rich
to
put
on
black
for
the
death
of
a
friend
it
must
be
morally
necessary
for
the
poor
to
do
the
same
we
see
no
difference
in
the
degrees
of
moral
feeling
the
soul
of
man
is
of
no
rank
but
of
equal
value
in
our
eyes
whether
belonging
to
rich
or
poor
but
this
usage
is
so
general
and
the
neglect
of
it
considered
such
a
disgrace
that
it
leaves
a
very
wide
door
open
for
the
entrance
of
false
pride
poverty
is
an
evil
which
most
persons
however
humble
their
stations
may
be
most
carefully
endeavour
to
conceal
to
avoid
an
exposure
of
their
real
circumstances
they
will
deprive
themselves
of
the
common
necessaries
of
life
and
incur
debts
which
they
have
no
prospect
of
paying
rather
than
allow
their
neighbours
to
suspect
that
they
can
not
afford
a
and
good
for
any
deceased
member
of
their
family
if
such
persons
would
but
follow
the
dictates
of
true
wisdom
honesty
and
truth
no
dread
of
the
opinion
of
others
should
tempt
them
to
do
what
they
can
not
afford
their
grief
for
the
dead
would
not
be
less
sincere
if
they
followed
the
body
of
the
beloved
in
their
ordinary
costume
to
the
grave
nor
is
the
spectacle
less
imposing
divested
of
all
the
solemn
foppery
which
attends
the
funeral
of
persons
who
move
in
respectable
society
some
years
ago
when
it
was
the
fashion
in
england
and
may
be
it
remains
the
fashion
still
to
give
black
silk
scarfs
and
hatbands
at
funerals
mean
and
covetous
persons
threw
themselves
in
the
way
of
picking
up
these
stray
loaves
and
fishes
a
lady
who
lived
in
the
same
town
with
me
after
i
was
married
boasted
to
me
that
her
husband
who
always
contrived
to
be
a
necessary
attendant
on
such
occasions
found
her
in
all
the
black
silk
she
required
for
articles
of
dress
and
that
he
had
not
purchased
a
pair
of
gloves
for
many
years
about
two
years
before
old
king
george
the
third
died
a
report
got
about
that
he
could
not
survive
many
days
there
was
a
general
rush
among
all
ranks
to
obtain
mourning
up
went
the
price
of
black
goods
norwich
crapes
and
bombazines
rose
ten
per
cent
and
those
who
were
able
to
secure
a
black
garment
at
any
price
to
shew
their
loyalty
were
deemed
very
fortunate
and
after
all
this
fuss
and
hurry
and
confusion
the
poor
mad
old
king
disappointed
the
speculators
in
sables
and
lived
on
in
darkness
and
mental
aberration
for
two
whole
years
the
mourning
of
some
on
that
occasion
was
not
imaginary
the
sorrow
with
them
was
not
for
the
but
that
he
had
on
these
public
occasions
of
grief
great
is
the
stir
and
bustle
in
economical
families
who
wish
to
show
a
decent
concern
for
the
death
of
the
monarch
but
who
do
not
exactly
like
to
go
to
the
expense
of
buying
new
clothes
for
such
a
short
period
as
a
court
mourning
all
the
old
family
stores
are
rummaged
carefully
over
and
every
stuff
gown
worn
ribbon
or
shabby
shawl
that
can
take
a
black
dye
is
handed
over
to
the
vat
and
these
black
garments
have
a
more
than
the
glossy
suits
of
the
gay
and
wealthy
for
it
is
actually
humiliating
to
wear
such
as
they
are
both
unbecoming
to
the
young
and
old
black
which
is
the
most
becoming
and
convenient
colour
for
general
wear
especially
to
the
old
and
would
no
longer
be
regarded
with
religious
horror
as
the
type
of
mortality
and
decay
but
would
take
its
place
on
the
same
shelf
with
the
gay
tints
that
form
the
motley
groups
in
our
handsome
stores
could
influential
people
be
found
to
expose
the
folly
and
vanity
of
this
practice
and
refuse
to
comply
with
its
demands
others
would
soon
be
glad
to
follow
their
example
and
before
many
years
it
would
sink
into
contempt
and
disuse
if
the
americans
the
most
practical
people
in
the
world
would
but
once
take
up
the
subject
and
publicly
lecture
on
its
absurdity
this
dismal
shadow
of
a
darker
age
would
no
longer
obscure
our
streets
and
scare
our
little
ones
men
would
wear
their
grief
in
their
hearts
and
not
around
their
hats
and
widows
would
be
better
known
by
their
serious
deportment
than
by
their
weeds
i
feel
certain
that
every
thinking
person
who
calmly
investigates
the
subject
will
be
tempted
to
exclaim
with
me
oh
that
the
good
sense
of
mankind
would
unite
in
banishing
it
for
ever
from
the
earth
the
song
of

chapter

odd
characters
dear
merry
reader
did
you
ever
hear
whilst
travelling
on
the
world
wide
beaten
road
the
curious
reasoning
and
opinions
queer
of
men
who
never
in
their
lives
one
hour
on
study
whose
existence
seems
a
thing
of
course
a
practical
delusion
a
day
of
frowning
clouds
and
sunny
gleams
of
pain
and
pleasure
mix
in
strange
confusion
who
feel
they
move
and
breathe
they
know
not
why
are
born
to
eat
and
drink
and
sleep
and
die
the
shores
of
the
prince
edward
district
become
more
bold
and
beautiful
as
the
steamer
pursues
her
course
up
the
long
reach
magnificent
trees
clothe
these
rugged
banks
to
their
very
summits
and
cast
dense
shadows
upon
the
waters
that
slumber
at
their
feet
the
slanting
rays
of
the
evening
sun
stream
through
their
thick
foliage
and
weave
a
network
of
gold
around
the
corrugated
trunks
of
the
huge
oak
and
maple
trees
that
tower
far
above
our
heads
the
glorious
waters
are
dyed
with
a
thousand
changeful
hues
of
crimson
and
saffron
and
reflect
from
their
unruffled
surface
the
gorgeous
tints
of
a
canadian
sunset
the
pines
with
their
plumes
loom
out
darkly
against
the
glowing
evening
sky
and
frown
austerely
upon
us
their
gloomy
aspect
affording
a
striking
contrast
to
the
leaves
of
the
feathery
birch
and
the
rock
elm
it
is
a
lonely
hour
and
one
that
nature
seems
to
have
set
apart
for
prayer
and
praise
a
devotional
spirit
seems
to
breathe
over
the
earth
the
woods
and
waters
softening
and
harmonising
the
whole
into
one
blessed
picture
of
love
and
peace
the
boat
has
again
crossed
the
bay
and
stops
to
take
in
wood
at

we
are
now
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
indian
woods
a
reserve
belonging
to
the
mohawks
in
the
township
of
tyendenaga
about
miles
by
water
from

a
broad
belt
of

the
background
to
a
cleared
slope
rising
gradually
from
the
water
until
it
reaches
a
considerable
elevation
above
the
shore
the
frontage
to
the
bay
is
filled
up
with
neat
farm
houses
and
patches
of
and
indian
corn
the
only
grain
that
remains
unharvested
at
this
season
of
the
year
we
have
a
fine
view
of
the
stone
church
built
by
the
indians
which
stands
on
the
top
of
the
hill
about
a
mile
from
the
water
queen
anne
presented
to
this
tribe
three
large
marble
tablets
engraved
with
the
ten
commandments
which
after
following
them
in
all
their
ramblings
for
a
century
and
a
half
now
grace
the
altar
of
this
church
and
are
regarded
with
great
veneration
by
the
indian
settlers
who
seem
to
look
upon
them
with
a
superstitious
awe
the
church
is
built
in
the
gothic
style
and
is
one
of
the
most
picturesque
village
churches
that
i
have
seen
in
canada
the
indians
contributed
a
great
part
of
the
funds
for
erecting
this
building
i
was
never
within
the
walls
of
the
sacred
edifice
but
i
have
wandered
round
the
quiet
peaceful
and
admired
the
lovely
prospect
it
commands
of
the
bay
and
the
opposite
shores
one
side
of
the
churchyard
is
skirted
by
a
natural
grove
of
forest
trees
which
separates
it
from
the
parsonage
a
neat
white
building
that
fronts
the
water
and
stands
back
from
it
at
the
head
of
a
noble
sweep
of
land
covered
with
velvet
turf
and
resembling
greatly
a
park
at
home
by
the
fine
groups
of
stately
forest
trees
scattered
over
it
and
a
semicircular
belt
of
the
original
forest
that
sloping
from
the
house
on
either
side
extends
its
wings
until
it
meets
the
blue
waters
of
the
bay
leaving
between
its
green
arms
a
broad
space
of
cleared
land
the
first
time
my
eyes
ever
rested
on
this
beautiful
spot
it
appeared
to
me
a
perfect
paradise
it
was
a
warm
balmy
moonlight
evening
in
june
the
rich
resinous
odour
of
the
woods
filled
the
air
with
delicious
perfume
were
glancing
like
shooting
stars
among
the
dark
foliage
that
hung
over
the
water
and
the
spirit
of
love
and
peace
sat
brooding
over
the
luxurious
solitude
whose
very
silence
was
eloquent
with
praise
of
the
great
maker
how
i
envied
the
residents
of
the
parsonage
their
lovely
home
how
disappointed
i
felt
when
g
told
me
that
she
felt
it
dull
and
lonely
that
she
was
out
of
society
and
that
the
indians
were
very
troublesome
neighbours
now
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
was
all
very
true
and
that
i
should
have
felt
the
same
want
that
she
did
after
the
bewitching
novelty
of
the
scene
had
become
familiar
but
it
sadly
destroyed
the
romance
and
poetry
of
it
to
me
at
the
time
this
part
of
the
township
of
tyendenaga
belongs
almost
exclusively
to
the
mohawk
indians
who
have
made
a
large
settlement
here
while
the
government
has
given
them
a
good
school
for
instructing
their
children
in
the
indian
and
english
languages
and
they
have
a
resident
clergyman
of
the
establishment
always
at
hand
to
minister
to
them
the
spiritual
consolations
of
religion
and
impart
to
them
the
blessed
truths
of
the
gospel
the
rev
g
was
for
some
years
the
occupant
of
the
pretty
and
was
greatly
beloved
by
his
indian
congregation
the
native
residents
of
these
woods
clear
farms
and
build
and
plant
like
their
white
neighbours
they
rear
horses
cattle
and
sheep
and
sow
a
sufficient
quantity
of
grain
to
secure
them
from
want
but
there
is
a
great
lack
of
order
and
regularity
in
all
their
agricultural
proceedings
they
do
not
make
half
as
much
out
of
their
lands
which
they
suffer
to
be
overgrown
with
thorns
and
thistles
as
their
white
neighbours
and
their
domestic
arrangements
within
doors
are
never
marked
by
that
appearance
of
comfort
and
cleanliness
which
is
to
be
seen
in
the
dwellings
of
the
native
canadians
and
emigrants
from
europe
the
red
man
is
out
of
his
element
when
he
settles
quietly
down
to
a
farm
and
you
perceive
it
at
a
glance
he
never
appears
to
advantage
as
a
resident
among
civilized
men
and
he
seems
painfully
conscious
of
his
inferiority
and
ignorance
of
the
arts
of
life
he
has
lost
his
identity
as
it
were
and
when
he
attempts
to
imitate
ihe
customs
and
manners
of
the
whites
he
is
too
apt
to
adopt
their
vices
without
acquiring
their
industry
and
perseverance
and
sinks
into
a
sottish
degraded
savage
the
proud
independence
we
admired
so
much
in
the
man
of
the
woods
has
disappeared
with
his
truthfulness
honesty
and
simple
manners
his
pure
blood
is
tainted
with
the
dregs
of
a
lower
humanity
degenerated
by
the
want
and
misery
of
european
cities
his
light
eyes
crisp
hair
and
complexion
too
surely
betray
his
mixed
origin
and
we
turn
from
the
half
educated
indian
with
feelings
of
aversion
and
mistrust
there
is
a
mohawk
family
who
reside
in
this
township
of
the
name
of
loft
who
have
gained
some
celebrity
in
the
colony
by
their
clever
representations
of
the
manners
and
customs
of
their
tribe
they
sing
indian
songs
dance
the
hold
councils
and
make
grave
speeches
in
the
characters
of
indian
chiefs
and
hunters
in
an
artistic
manner
that
would
gain
the
applause
of
a
more
fastidious
audience
the
two
young
squaws
who
were
the
principal
performers
in
this
travelling
indian
opera
were
the
most
beautiful
indian
women
i
ever
beheld
there
was
no
base
alloy
in
their
pure
native
blood
they
had
the
large
dark
humid
eyes
the
ebon
locks
tinged
with
purple
so
peculiar
to
their
race
and
which
gives
such
a
rich
tint
to
the
clear
olive
skin
and
brilliant
white
teeth
of
the
denizens
of
the
canadian
wilderness
susannah
loft
and
her
sister
were
the
of
indian
women
and
their
graceful
and
symmetrical
figures
were
set
off
to
great
advantage
by
their
picturesque
and
becoming
costume
which
in
their
case
was
composed
of
the
richest
materials
their
acting
and
carriage
were
dignified
and
and
their
appearance
singularly
pleasing
and
interesting
susannah
the
eldest
and
certainly
the
most
graceful
of
these
truly
fascinating
girls
was
unfortunately
killed
last
summer
by
the
collision
of
two
while
travelling
professionally
with
her
sister
through
the
states
those
who
had
listened
with
charmed
ears
to
her
sweet
voice
and
gazed
with
admiring
eyes
upon
her
personal
charms
were
greatly
shocked
at
her
untimely
death
a
little
boy
and
girl
belonging
to
the
same
talented
family
have
been
brought
before
the
public
in
order
to
supply
her
place
but
they
have
not
been
able
to
fill
up
the
blank
occasioned
by
her
loss
the
steamboat
again
leaves
the
north
shore
and
stands
across
from
the
stone
mills
which
are
in
the
prince
edward
district
and
form
one
of
the
features
of
the
remarkable
scenery
of
what
is
called
the
high
shore
this
mountainous
ridge
which
descends
perpendicularly
to
the
water
edge
is
still
in
forest
and
without
doubt
this
is
the
most
romantic
portion
of
the
bay
whose
waters
are
suddenly
contracted
to
half
their
former
dimensions
and
glide
on
darkly
and
silently
between
these
steep
heights
there
is
a
small
lake
upon
the
highest
portion
of
this
whose
waters
are
led
down
the
steep
bank
and
made
to
work
a
which
is
certainly
giving
a
very
unromantic
turn
to
them
but
here
as
in
the
states
the
beautiful
and
the
ideal
are
instantly
converted
into
the
real
and
the
practical
this
lake
of
the
mountains
is
a
favourite
place
for
picnics
and
pleasure
trips
from
northport
and
belleville
here
the
children
come
once
during
the
summer
to
enjoy
a
ramble
in
the
woods
and
spread
their
feast
beneath
the
lordly
oaks
and
maples
that
crown
these
heights
and
the
teetotallers
marshall
their
bands
of
converts
and
hold
their
cold
water
festival
beside
the
blue
deep
waters
of
this
mysterious
strange
stories
are
told
of
its
unfathomable
depth
of
the
quicksands
that
are
found
near
it
and
of
its
being
supplied
from
the
inland
ocean
of
lake
huron
but
like
the
cove
in
tyendenaga
of
which
everybody
in
the
neighbourhood
has
heard
something
but
which
nobody
has
seen
these
accounts
of
the
lake
of
the
mountain
rest
only
upon
hearsay
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
still
lingered
on
wood
and
stream
when
we
arrived
at
picton
which
stands
at
the
head
of
the
long
reach
the
bay
here
is
not
wider
than
a
broad
river
the
banks
are
very
lofty
and
enclose
the
water
in
an
oblong
form
round
which
that
part
of
the
town
which
is
near
the
shore
is
built
picton
is
a
very
beautiful
place
viewed
from
the
deck
of
the
steamer
its
situation
is
novel
and
imposing
and
the
number
of
pretty
cottages
that
crown
the
steep
ridge
that
rises
almost
perpendicularly
from
the
water
peeping
out
from
among
fine
orchards
in
full
bearing
and
trim
gardens
give
it
quite
a
rural
appearance
the
steamboat
enters
this
fairy
bay
by
a
very
narrow
passage
and
after
delivering
freight
and
passengers
at
the
wharf
backs
out
by
the
way
she
came
in
there
is
no
turning
a
large
vessel
round
this
long
of
deep
blue
water
few
spots
in
canada
would
afford
a
finer
subject
for
the
artist
pencil
than
this
small
inland
town
which
is
so
seldom
visited
by
strangers
and
tourists
the
progress
to
wealth
and
importance
made
by
this
place
is
strikingly
behind
that
of
belleville
which
far
exceeds
it
in
size
and
population
three
years
ago
a
very
destructive
fire
consumed
some
of
the
principal
buildings
in
the
town
which
has
not
yet
recovered
from
its
effects
trade
is
not
so
brisk
here
as
in
belleville
and
the
streets
are
dull
and
monotonous
when
compared
with
the
stir
and
bustle
of
the
latter
which
during
the
winter
season
is
crowded
with
sleighs
from
the
country
the
bay
of
quinte
during
the
winter
forms
an
excellent
road
to
all
the
villages
and
towns
on
its
shores
the
people
from
the
opposite
side
trade
more
with
the
belleville
merchants
than
with
those
in
their
own
district
and
during
the
winter
season
when
the
bay
is
completely
frozen
from
the
mouth
of
the
trent
to
kingston
loaded
teams
are
passing
to
and
fro
continually
it
is
the
favourite
afternoon
drive
of
young
and
old
and
when
the
wind
sweeping
over
such
a
broad
surface
of
ice
is
not
and
you
are
well
wrapped
up
in
furs
and
buffalo
robes
a
sleigh
ride
on
the
ice
is
very
delightful
not
that
i
can
ever
wholly
divest
myself
of
a
vague
indistinct
sense
of
danger
whilst
rapidly
gliding
over
this
frozen
mirror
i
would
rather
be
out
on
the
bay
in
a
gale
of
wind
in
a
small
boat
than
overtaken
by
a
snow
storm
on
its
frozen
highways
still
it
is
a
pleasant
sight
of
a
bright
glowing
winter
day
when
the
landscape
glitters
like
a
world
composed
of
crystals
to
watch
the
handsome
sleighs
filled
with
men
and
women
and
drawn
by
spirited
horses
dashing
in
all
directions
over
this
brilliant
field
of
dazzling
white
night
has
fallen
rapidly
upon
us
since
we
left
picton
in
the
distance
a
darker
shade
is
upon
the
woods
the
hills
the
waters
and
by
the
time
we
approach
fredericksburg
it
will
be
dark
this
too
is
a
very
pretty
place
on
the
north
side
of
the
bay
beautiful
orchards
and
meadows
skirt
the
water
and
fine
and
grow
beside
or
bend
over
the
waves
the
green
smooth
meadows
out
of
which
the
black
stumps
rotted
long
ago
show
noble
groups
of
hiccory
and
and
sleek
fat
cows
are
reposing
beneath
them
or
standing
in
the
small
creek
that
wanders
through
them
to
pour
its
fairy
tribute
into
the
broad
bay
we
must
leave
the
deck
and
retreat
into
the
ladies
cabin
for
the
air
from
the
water
grows
chilly
and
the
sense
of
seeing
can
no
longer
be
gratified
by
remaining
where
we
are
but
if
you
open
your
eyes
to
see
and
your
ears
to
hear
all
the
strange
sayings
and
doings
of
the
odd
people
you
meet
in
a
steamboat
you
will
never
lack
amusement
the
last
time
i
went
down
to
kingston
there
was
a
little
girl
in
the
cabin
who
rejoiced
in
the
possession
of
a
very
large
american
doll
made
so
nearly
to
resemble
an
infant
that
at
a
distance
it
was
easy
to
mistake
it
for
one
to
render
the
deception
more
striking
you
could
make
it
cry
like
a
child
by
pressing
your
hand
upon
its
body
a
thin
farmer
wife
came
on
board
at
the
wharf
we
have
just
quitted
and
it
was
amusing
to
watch
her
alternately
gazing
at
the
little
girl
and
her
doll
is
that
your
baby
cissy
no
it
my
doll
mi
what
a
strange
doll
is
that
something
i
took
it
for
a
real
child
look
at
its
bare
feet
and
hands
and
bald
head
well
i
do
think
it
right
to
make
a
piece
of
wood
look
so
like
a
human
critter
the
child
put
the
doll
into
the
woman
hands
who
happening
to
take
it
rather
roughly
the
wooden
baby
gave
a
loud
squall
the
woman
face
expressed
the
utmost
horror
and
she
dropped
it
on
the
floor
as
if
it
had
been
a
hot
coal
gracious
goodness
me
the
thing
alive
the
little
girl
laughed
heartily
and
taking
up
the
discarded
doll
explained
to
the
woman
the
simple
method
employed
to
produce
the
sound
well
it
do
sound
quite
said
her
astonished
companion
what
will
they
find
out
next
it
beats
the
railroad
and
the
telegraph
holler
ah
but
i
saw
a
big
doll
that
could
speak
when
i
was
with
mamma
in
new
york
said
the
child
with
glistening
eyes
a
doll
that
could
speak
you
do
say
oh
do
tell
while
the
young
lady
described
the
automaton
doll
it
was
amusing
to
watch
the
expressions
of
surprise
wonder
and
curiosity
that
flitted
over
the
woman
brig
cadaverous
face
she
would
have
made
a
good
study
for
a
painter
a
young
relative
of
mine
went
down
in
the
steamboat
to
be
present
at
the
provincial
agricultural
show
that
was
held
that
year
in
the
town
of
buckville
on
the
lawrence
it
was
the
latter
end
of
september
the
weather
was
wet
and
stormy
and
the
boat
loaded
to
the
water
edge
with
cattle
and
passengers
the
promenade
decks
were
filled
up
with
pigs
sheep
and
oxen
cows
were
looking
sleepily
in
at
the
open
doors
of
the
ladies
cabin
and
bulls
were
fastened
on
the
upper
deck
such
a
motley
group
of
bipeds
and
quadrupeds
were
never
before
huddled
into
such
a
narrow
space
and
amidst
all
this
din
and
confusion
a
scotch
piper
was
playing
lustily
on
the
bagpipes
greatly
to
the
edification
i
no
doubt
of
himself
and
the
crowd
of
animal
life
around
him
the
night
came
on
very
dark
and
stormy
and
many
of
the
women
suffered
as
much
from
the
pitching
of
the
boat
as
if
they
had
been
at
sea
the
ladies
cabin
was
crowded
to
overflowing
every
sofa
bed
and
chair
was
occupied
and
my
young
friend
who
did
not
feel
any
inconvenience
from
the
storm
was
greatly
entertained
by
the
dialogues
carried
on
across
the
cabin
by
the
women
who
were
reposing
in
their
berths
and
lamenting
over
the
rough
weather
and
their
own
sufferings
in
consequence
they
were
mostly
the
wives
of
farmers
and
respectable
mechanics
and
the
language
they
used
was
neither
very
choice
nor
grammatical
i
say
c
how
be
you
i
feel
bad
any
how
with
a
smothered
groan
have
you
been
sick
not
yet
but
feel
as
if
i
was
going
to
how
your
head
coming
on
mrs
n
it
just
splitting
i
thank
you
oh
how
awful
the
boat
do
pitch
cries
a
third
if
she
should
sink
i
afeard
we
shall
all
go
to
the
bottom
and
think
of
all
the
poor
sheep
and
cattle
well
of
course
they
have
to
go
too
oh
mi
i
get
up
and
be
ready
for
a
start
in
case
of
the
worst
cried
a
young
girl
c
do
give
me
something
good
out
of
your
basket
to
keep
up
my
spirits
well
i
will
come
over
here
and
you
and
i
will
have
some
talk
my
basket
at
the
foot
of
my
berth
you
find
in
it
a
small
bottle
of
brandy
and
some
crulls
so
up
got
several
of
the
sick
ladies
and
kept
up
their
spirits
by
eating
cakes
chewing
gum
and
drinking
cold
brandy
punch
did
h
lose
much
in
the
fire
last
night
said
one
oh
dear
yes
she
lost
all
her
clothes
and
three
large
jars
of
preserves
she
made
about
a
week
ago
and
in
accordance
a
common
yankee
phrase
often
used
instead
of
the
word
proportion
there
was
an
honest
yorkshire
farmer
and
his
wife
on
board
and
when
the
morning
at
length
broke
through
pouring
rain
and
driving
mist
and
the
port
to
which
they
were
bound
loomed
through
the
haze
the
women
were
very
anxious
to
know
if
their
husbands
who
slept
in
the
cabin
were
awake
they
ar
stirring
yet
said
g
for
i
hear
isaac
meaning
her
husband
below
a
most
expressive
term
for
very
hard
snoring
the
same
isaac
when
he
came
up
to
the
ladies
cabin
to
take
his
wife
on
shore
complained
in
his
broad
yorkshire
dialect
that
he
had
been
kept
awake
all
night
by
a
jovial
gentleman
who
had
been
his
in
the
cabin
we
had
terrible
noisy
chap
in
they
called
him
d
and
said
he
was
of
belleville
but
i
thought
they
were
he
would
sleep
himself
nor
let

he
gat
piper
an
put
him
top
o
table
and
kept
him
playing
all
one
would
think
that
friend
isaac
had
been
haunted
by
the
vision
of
the
piper
in
his
dreams
for
certes
the
jovial
buzzing
of
the
pipes
had
not
been
able
to
drown
the
deep
drone
of
his
own
nasal
organ
a
gentleman
who
was
travelling
in
company
with
sir
a
told
me
an
anecdote
of
him
and
how
he
treated
an
impertinent
fellow
on
board
one
of
the
lake
boats
that
greatly
amused
me
the
state
cabins
in
these
large
steamers
open
into
the
great
saloon
and
as
they
are
often
occupied
by
married
people
each
berth
contains
two
beds
one
placed
above
the
other
now
it
often
happens
when
the
boat
is
greatly
crowded
that
two
passengers
of
the
same
sex
are
forced
to
occupy
the
same
sleeping
room
this
was
sir
a
case
and
he
was
obliged
though
very
reluctantly
to
share
his
sleeping
apartment
with
a
american
but
evidently
a
man
of
low
standing
from
the
familiarity
of
his
manners
and
the
bad
grammar
he
used
in
the
morning
it
was
necessary
for
one
gentleman
to
rise
before
the
other
as
the
space
in
front
of
their
berths
was
too
narrow
to
allow
of
more
than
one
performing
his
ablutions
at
a
time
our
yankee
made
a
fair
start
and
had
nearly
completed
his
toilet
when
he
suddenly
spied
a
and
a
box
of
in
the
his
companion
had
left
open
on
the
washstand
upon
these
he
pounced
and
having
made
a
liberal
use
of
them
flung
them
back
into
the
case
and
sat
down
upon
the
only
chair
the
room
contained
in
order
to
gratify
his
curiosity
by
watching
how
his
sleeping
partner
went
through
the
same
process
sir
a
greatly
annoyed
by
the
fellow
assurance
got
out
of
bed
and
placing
the
washhand
basin
on
the
floor
put
his
feet
into
the
water
and
commenced
scrubbing
his
with
the
desecrated
jonathan
watched
his
movements
for
a
few
seconds
in
silent
horror
at
length
unable
to
contain
himself
he
exclaimed
well
stranger
that
the
dirtiest
use
i
ever
see
a
toothbrush
put
to
any
how
i
saw
it
put
to
a
dirtier
just
now
said
sir
a
very
coolly
i
always
use
that
brush
for
cleaning
my
toes
the
yankee
turned
very
green
and
fled
to
the
deck
but
his
nausea
was
not
the
village
of
nappanee
on
the
north
side
of
the
bay
is
situated
on
a
very
pretty
river
that
bears
the
same
name
nappanee
in
the
mohawk
language
signifying
flour
the
village
is
a
mile
back
from
the
bay
and
is
not
much
seen
from
the
water
there
are
a
great
many
mills
here
both
grist
and
saw
mills
from
which
circumstance
it
most
likely
derives
its
name
amherst
island
which
is
some
miles
in
extent
stands
between
ontario
and
the
bay
of
quinte
its
upper
and
lower
extremity
forming
the
two
straits
that
are
called
the
upper
and
lower
gap
and
the
least
breeze
which
is
not
perceptible
in
the
other
portions
of
the
bay
is
felt
here
passing
through
these
gaps
on
a
stormy
day
creates
as
great
a
nausea
as
a
short
chopping
sea
on
the
atlantic
and
i
have
seen
both
men
and
women
retreat
to
their
berths
to
avoid
disagreeable
consequences
amherst
island
is
several
miles
in
extent
and
there
are
many
good
farms
in
high
cultivation
upon
it
while
its
proximity
on
all
sides
to
the
water
affords
excellent
sport
to
the
angler
and
gunner
as
wild
ducks
abound
in
this
vicinity
just
after
you
pass
the
island
and
enter
the
lower
gap
there
are
three
very
small
islands
in
a
direct
line
with
each
other
that
are
known
as
the
three
brothers
a
hermit
has
taken
up
his
abode
on
the
centre
one
and
built
a
very
robinson
crusoe
looking
hut
near
the
water
composed
of
round
logs
and
large
stones
cemented
together
with
clay
he
gets
his
living
by
fishing
and
fowling
and
you
see
his
boat
drawn
up
in
a
little
cove
near
his
odd
dwelling
i
was
very
curious
to
obtain
some
particulars
of
the
private
history
of
this
eccentric
individual
but
beyond
what
i
have
just
related
my
informants
could
tell
me
nothing
or
why
he
had
chosen
this
solitary
abode
in
such
an
exposed
situation
and
so
far
apart
from
all
the
comforts
of
social
life
the
town
of
bath
is
the
last
place
of
any
note
on
this
portion
of
the
bay
until
you
arrive
at
kingston
a
morning
song
the
young
wheat
is
springing
all
tender
and
green
and
the
blackbird

singing
the

the
leaves
of
the

burst
from
their
prison
and
the
bright
eyes
of
morn
on

arisen
while
sluggards
are

oh
hasten
with
me
while
the
night
mists
are
weeping
soft
showers
on
each
tree
and
nature
is
glowing
beneath
the
warm
beam
the
young
day
is
throwing
mountain
and

and
the
shy
colt
is
bounding
across
the
wide
mead
and
his
wild
hoofs
resounding
increases
his
speed
now
starting
and
crossing
at
each
shadow
he
sees
now
wantonly
tossing
his
mane
in
the
breeze
the
is
shaking
the
dew
from
her
wing
and
the
clover
forsaking
soars
upwards
to
sing
in
rapture
outpouring
her
anthem
of
love
where
angels
adoring

dull

on

no

the

within

the

see

ghastly
phantom
stand
between

and
the
sunshine
now
that
mocking
face
still
haunts
my
dreams
that
eye
that
never

oh
it

like

but
never
weeps

still
it

oh
that

far
worse
so
much
has
been
written
about
the
city
of
kingston
so
lately
the
seat
of
government
and
so
remarkable
for
its
fortifications
and
the
importance
it
ever
must
be
to
the
colony
as
a
military
depot
and
place
of
defence
that
it
is
not
my
intention
to
enter
into
a
minute
description
of
it
here
i
was
greatly
pleased
as
i
think
every
stranger
must
be
with
its
general
aspect
particularly
as
seen
from
the
water
in
which
respect
it
has
a
great
advantage
over
toronto
the
number
of
vessels
lying
at
the
different
wharfs
and
the
constant
arrival
of
noble
steamers
both
from
the
united
states
and
the
upper
and
lower
province
give
it
a
very
appearance
yet
upon
landing
you
are
struck
with
the
want
of
stir
and
bustle
in
the
principal
thoroughfares
when
contrasted
with
the
size
and
magnitude
of
the
streets
the
removal
of
the
seat
of
government
has
checked
the
growth
of
kingston
for
a
while
but
you
feel
while
examining
its
commanding
position
that
it
must
always
be
the
key
of
the
upper
province
the
great
rallying
point
in
case
of
war
or
danger
the
market
house
is
a
very
fine
building
and
the
wants
of
the
city
could
be
supplied
within
its
area
were
it
three
times
the
size
that
it
is
at
present
the
market
is
decidedly
one
of
the
chief
attractions
of
the
place
the
streets
are
wide
and
well
paved
and
there
are
a
great
many
fine
trees
in
and
about
kingston
which
give
to
it
the
appearance
of
a
european
town
the
houses
are
chiefly
of
brick
and
stone
along
the
public
thoroughfares
and
there
are
many
neat
private
dwellings
inclosed
in
trim
gardens
the
road
leading
to
the
provincial
penitentiary
runs
parallel
with
the
water
and
forms
a
delightful
drive
it
is
about
three
years
ago
that
i
paid
a
visit
with
my
husband
to
the
penitentiary
and
went
over
every
part
of
it
i
must
own
that
i
felt
a
greater
curiosity
to
see
the
convicts
than
the
prison
which
contained
them
and
my
wishes
were
completely
gratified
as
my
husband
was
detained
for
several
hours
on
business
and
i
had
a
long
interval
of
leisure
to
examine
the
workshops
where
the
convicts
were
employed
at
their
different
trades
their
sleeping
cells
chapel
and
places
of
punishment
the
silence
system
is
maintained
here
no
conversation
being
allowed
between
the
prisoners
i
was
surprised
at
the
neatness
cleanliness
order
and
regularity
of
all
the
arrangements
in
the
vast
building
and
still
more
astonished
that
forty
or
fifty
strong
active
looking
men
unfettered
with
the
free
use
of
their
limbs
could
be
controlled
by
one
person
who
sat
on
a
tall
chair
as
overseer
of
each
ward
in
several
instances
particularly
in
the
tailoring
and
shoemaking
department
the
overseers
were
small
men
but
such
is
the
force
of
habit
and
the
want
of
moral
courage
which
generally
accompanies
guilt
that
a
word
or
a
look
from
these
men
was
sufficient
to
keep
them
at
work
the
dress
of
the
male
convicts
was
warm
and
comfortable
though
certainly
not
very
elegant
consisting
for
it
was
late
in
the
fall
of
a
thick
woollen
jacket
one
side
of
it
being
brown
the
other
yellow
with
trowsers
to
correspond
a
shirt
of
coarse
factory
cotton
but
very
clean
and
good
stout
shoes
and
warm
knitted
woollen
socks
the
letters
for
provincial
penitentiary
are
sewed
in
coloured
cloth
upon
the
dark
side
of
the
jacket
their
hair
is
cut
very
short
to
the
head
and
they
wear
a
cloth
cap
of
the
same
colours
that
compose
their
dress
the
cells
are
narrow
just
wide
enough
to
contain
a
small
bed
a
stool
and
a
and
the
prisoners
are
divided
from
each
other
by
thick
stone
walls
they
are
locked
in
every
night
at
six
and
their
cell
is
so
constructed
that
one
of
the
keepers
can
always
look
in
upon
the
convict
without
his
being
aware
of
the
scrutiny
the
bedding
was
scrupulously
clean
and
i
saw
a
plain
bible
in
each
cell
there
is
a
sort
of
machine
resembling
a
stone
coffin
in
which
mutinous
convicts
are
confined
for
a
given
time
they
stand
in
an
upright
position
and
as
there
are
air
holes
for
breathing
the
look
and
name
of
the
thing
is
more
dreadful
than
the
punishment
which
can
not
be
the
least
painful
i
asked
the
gentleman
who
showed
us
over
the
building
what
country
sent
the
most
prisoners
to
the
penitentiary
he
smiled
and
told
me
guess
i
did
so
but
was
wrong
no
said
he
we
have
more
french
canadians
and
men
of
colour
then
irish
english
and
loafers
from
the
states
of
the
scotch
we
have
very
few
but
they
are
very
bad
the
most
ungovernable
sullen
and
disobedient
when
a
scotchman
is
bad
enough
to
be
brought
here
he
is
like
jeremiah
bad
figs
only
fit
for
the
gallows
moodie
bailiffs
had
taken
down
a
young
fellow
about
twenty
years
of
age
who
had
been
convicted
at
the
assizes
for
stealing
curious
coins
from
a
person
who
had
brought
them
out
to
this
country
as
old
family
relics
the
evidence
was
more
circumstantial
than
positive
and
many
persons
believed
the
lad
innocent
he
had
kept
up
his
spirits
bravely
on
the
voyage
and
was
treated
with
great
kindness
by
the
men
who
had
him
in
custody
but
when
once
within
the
massy
walls
of
the
huge
building
his
courage
seemed
to
forsake
him
all
at
once
we
passed
him
as
he
sat
on
the
bench
while
the
barber
was
cutting
his
hair
and
shaving
off
his
whiskers
his
handsome
suit
had
been
removed
he
was
in
the
dress
before
described
there
was
in
his
face
an
expression
of
great
anguish
and
tears
were
rolling
in
quick
succession
down
his
cheeks
poor
fellow
i
should
hardly
have
known
him
again
so
completely
was
he
humbled
by
his
present
position
m
told
me
that
they
had
some
men
in
the
penitentiary
who
had
returned
three
different
times
to
it
and
had
grown
so
attached
to
their
prison
that
they
preferred
being
there
well
clothed
and
well
fed
to
gaining
a
precarious
living
elsewhere
executions
in
canada
are
so
rare
even
for
murder
that
many
atrocious
criminals
are
found
within
these
walls
men
and
women
who
could
not
possibly
have
escaped
the
gallows
in
england
at
twelve
i
followed
m
to
the
great
hall
to
see
the
prisoners
dine
the
meal
consisted
of
excellent
soups
with
a
portion
of
the
meat
which
had
been
boiled
in
it
potatoes
and
brown
bread
all
very
clean
and
good
of
their
kind
i
took
a
plate
of
the
soup
and
a
piece
of
the
bread
and
enjoyed
both
greatly
i
could
not
help
thinking
while
watching
these
men
in
their
comfortable
dresses
taking
their
wholesome
meal
how
much
better
they
were
fed
and
lodged
than
thousands
of
honest
industrious
men
who
had
to
maintain
large
families
upon
a
crust
of
bread
in
the
great
manufacturing
cities
at
home
most
of
these
men
had
very
bad
countenances
and
i
never
felt
so
much
convinced
of
the
truth
of
phrenology
as
while
looking
at
their
heads
the
extraordinary
formation
or
rather
of
some
of
them
led
me
to
think
that
their
possessors
were
hardly
accountable
for
their
actions
one
man
in
particular
who
had
committed
a
very
atrocious
murder
and
was
confined
for
life
had
a
most
singular
head
such
as
one
indeed
as
i
never
before
saw
on
a
human
body
it
was
immensely
large
at
the
base
and
appeared
perfectly
round
while
at
the
crown
it
rose
to
a
point
like
a
he
was
of
a
dull
complexion
with
large
prominent
eyes
of
a
pale
green
colour
his
expression
the
most
repulsively
cruel
and
sinister
the
eye
involuntarily
singled
him
out
among
all
his
comrades
as
something
too
terrible
to
escape
observation
among
such
a
number
of
men
who
were
there
present
i
was
surprised
at
seeing
so
few
with
red
or
fair
hair
i
noticed
this
to
my
companion
he
had
never
observed
it
before
but
said
it
was
strange
the
convicts
were
mostly
of
a
dull
grey
complexion
large
eyed
stolid
looking
men
or
with
very
black
hair
and
heavy
black
brows
i
could
only
account
for
this
circumstance
from
the
fact
that
though
people
are
often
violently
passionate
and
easily
excited
their
anger
is
sudden
and
quick
never
premeditated
but
generally
the
work
of
the
moment
like
straw
on
a
fire
it
kindles
into
a
fierce
blaze
but
it
is
over
in
an
instant
they
seldom
retain
it
or
bear
malice
not
so
the
dull
sluggish
man
he
is
slow
to
act
but
he
broods
over
a
supposed
affront
or
injury
and
never
forgets
it
he
plans
the
moment
of
retaliation
and
stabs
his
enemy
when
least
prepared
there
were
many
stolid
men
in
that
prison
many
with
black
jealous
eyes
in
whose
gloomy
depths
suspicion
and
revenge
seemed
to
lurk
even
to
look
at
these
men
as
they
passed
on
seemed
to
arouse
their
vindictive
feelings
and
they
scowled
disdainfully
upon
us
as
they
walked
on
to
their
respective
places
there
was
one
man
among
these
dark
criminals
who
from
his
proud
carriage
and
bearing
particularly
arrested
my
attention
i
pointed
him
out
to
that
man
has
the
appearance
of
an
educated
person
he
looks
as
if
he
had
been
a
gentleman
you
are
right
was
his
reply
he
was
a
gentleman
the
son
of
a
district
judge
and
brought
up
to
the
law
a
clever
man
too
but
these
walls
do
not
contain
a
worse
in
every
respect
he
was
put
in
here
for
arson
and
an
attempt
to
murder
many
a
poor
man
has
been
hung
with
half
his
guilt
there
are
two
men
near
him
i
said
who
have
not
the
appearance
of
criminals
at
all
what
have
they
done
they
are
not
felons
but
two
soldiers
put
in
here
for
a
week
for
disorderly
conduct
what
a
shame
i
cried
to
degrade
them
in
this
manner
what
good
can
it
do
oh
said
he
laughing
it
will
make
them
desert
to
the
states
the
moment
they
get
out
and
those
two
little
boys
what
are
they
here
for
for
murder
whispered
he
i
almost
sprang
from
my
seat
it
appeared
too
dreadful
to
be
true
yes
he
continued
that
child
to
the
right
is
in
for
shooting
his
sister
the
other
to
the
left
for
killing
a
boy
of
his
own
age
with
a
hoe
and
burying
him
under
the
roots
of
a
fallen
tree
both
of
these
boys
come
from
the
neighbourhood
of
peterboro
your
district
by
the
bye
sends
fewer
convicts
to
the
penitentiary
than
any
part
of
the
upper
province
it
was
with
great
pleasure
i
heard
him
say
this
during
a
residence
of
thirteen
years
at
belleville
there
has
not
been
one
execution
the
county
of
hastings
is
still
unstained
with
the
blood
of
a
criminal
there
is
so
little
robbery
committed
in
this
part
of
the
country
that
the
thought
of
thieves
or
housebreakers
never
for
a
moment
disturbs
our
rest
this
is
not
the
case
in
hamilton
and
toronto
where
daring
acts
of
housebreaking
are
of
frequent
occurrence
the
constant
influx
of
runaway
slaves
from
the
states
has
added
greatly
to
the
criminal
lists
on
the
frontier
the
addition
of
these
people
to
our
population
is
not
much
to
be
coveted
the
slave
from
his
previous
habits
and
education
does
not
always
make
a
good
citizen
during
the
last
assizes
at
cobourg
a
black
man
and
his
wife
were
condemned
to
be
hung
for
a
most
horrible
murder
and
their
son
a
young
man
of
twenty
years
of
age
offered
the
sheriff
to
hang
his
own
father
and
mother
for
a
new
suit
of
clothes
those
who
laud
the
black
man
and
place
him
above
the
white
let
them
produce
in
the
whole
annals
of
human
crime
a
more
atrocious
one
than
this
yet
was
not
a
hanging
i
heard
a
gentleman
exclaim
with
honest
indignation
when
this
anecdote
was
told
in
his
hearing
if
a
man
were
wanting
to
hang
that
monster
i
would
do
it
myself
but
leaving
the
male
convicts
i
must
now
introduce
my
reader
to
the
female
inmates
of
this
house
of
woe
and
crime
at
the
time
of
my
visit
there
were
only
forty
women
in
the
penitentiary
this
speaks
much
for
the
superior
moral
training
of
the
feebler
sex
my
chief
object
in
visiting
their
department
was
to
look
at
the
celebrated
murderess
grace
marks
of
whom
i
had
heard
a
great
deal
not
only
from
the
public
papers
but
from
the
gentleman
who
defended
her
upon
her
trial
and
whose
able
pleading
saved
her
from
the
gallows
on
which
her
wretched
accomplice
closed
his
guilty
career
as
many
of
my
english
readers
may
never
have
heard
even
the
name
of
this
remarkable
criminal
it
may
not
be
uninteresting
to
them
to
give
a
brief
sketch
of
the
events
which
placed
her
here
about
eight
or
nine
years
ago
i
write
from
memory
and
am
not
very
certain
as
to
dates
a
young
irish
emigrant
girl
was
hired
into
the
service
of
captain
kinnaird
an
officer
on
who
had
purchased
a
farm
about
thirty
miles
in
the
rear
of
toronto
but
the
name
of
the
township
and
the
county
in
which
it
was
situated
i
have
forgotten
but
this
is
of
little
consequence
to
my
narrative
both
circumstances
could
be
easily
ascertained
by
the
curious
the
captain
had
been
living
for
some
time
on
very
intimate
terms
with
his
housekeeper
a
handsome
young
woman
of
the
name
of
hannah
montgomery
who
had
been
his
servant
of
all
work
her
familiarity
with
her
master
who
it
appears
was
a
very
fine
looking
gentlemanly
person
had
rendered
her
very
impatient
of
her
former
menial
employments
and
she
soon
became
virtually
the
mistress
of
the
house
grace
marks
was
hired
to
wait
upon
her
and
perform
all
the
coarse
drudgery
that
hannah
considered
herself
too
fine
a
lady
to
do
while
hannah
occupied
the
parlour
with
her
master
and
sat
at
his
table
her
insolent
airs
of
superiority
aroused
the
jealousy
and
envy
of
grace
marks
and
the
macdermot
who
considered
themselves
quite
superior
to
their
mistress
macdermot
was
the
son
of
respectable
parents
but
from
being
a
wild
ungovernable
boy
he
became
a
bad
vicious
man
and
early
abandoned
the
parental
roof
to
enlist
for
a
soldier
he
was
soon
tired
of
his
new
profession
and
deserting
from
his
regiment
escaped
detection
and
emigrated
to
canada
having
no
means
of
his
own
he
was
glad
to
engage
with
captain
kinnaird
as
his
servant
to
whom
his
character
and
previous
habits
were
unknown
these
circumstances
together
with
what
follows
were
drawn
from
his
confession
made
to
mac
ie
who
had
conducted
his
defence
the
night
previous
to
his
execution
perhaps
it
will
be
better
to
make
him
the
narrator
of
his
own
story
grace
marks
was
hired
by
captain
kinnaird
to
wait
upon
his
housekeeper
a
few
days
after
i
entered
his
service
she
was
a
pretty
girl
and
very
smart
about
her
work
but
of
a
silent
sullen
temper
it
was
very
difficult
to
know
when
she
was
pleased
her
age
did
not
exceed
seventeen
years
after
the
work
of
the
day
was
over
she
and
i
generally
were
left
to
ourselves
in
the
kitchen
hannah
being
entirely
taken
up
with
her
master
grace
was
very
jealous
of
the
difference
made
between
her
and
the
whom
she
hated
and
to
whom
she
was
often
very
insolent
and
saucy
her
whole
conversation
to
me
was
on
this
subject
is
she
better
than
us
she
would
say
she
is
to
be
treated
like
a
lady
and
eat
and
drink
of
the
best
she
is
not
better
born
than
we
are
or
better
educated
i
will
not
stay
here
to
be
domineered
over
by
her
either
she
or
i
must
soon
leave
this
every
little
complaint
hannah
made
of
me
was
repeated
to
me
with
cruel
exaggerations
till
my
dander
was
up
and
i
began
to
regard
the
unfortunate
woman
as
our
common
enemy
the
good
looks
of
grace
had
interested
me
in
her
cause
and
though
there
was
something
about
the
girl
that
i
could
not
exactly
like
i
had
been
a
very
lawless
dissipated
fellow
and
if
a
woman
was
young
and
pretty
i
cared
very
little
about
her
character
grace
was
sullen
and
proud
and
not
very
easily
won
over
to
my
purpose
but
in
order
to
win
her
liking
if
possible
i
gave
a
ready
ear
to
all
her
discontented
repinings
one
day
captain
kinnaird
went
to
toronto
to
draw
his
pay
and
left
word
with
hannah
that
he
would
be
back
by
noon
the
next
day
she
had
made
some
complaint
against
us
to
him
and
he
had
promised
to
pay
us
off
on
his
return
this
had
come
to
the
ears
of
grace
and
her
hatred
to
the
housekeeper
was
increased
to
a
tenfold
degree
i
take
heaven
to
witness
that
i
had
no
designs
against
the
life
of
the
unfortunate
woman
when
my
master
left
the
house
hannah
went
out
in
the
afternoon
to
visit
some
friends
she
had
in
the
neighbourhood
and
left
grace
and
i
alone
together
this
was
an
opportunity
too
good
to
be
lost
and
instead
of
minding
our
work
we
got
recapitulating
our
fancied
wrongs
over
some
of
the
captain
whisky
i
urged
my
suit
to
grace
but
she
would
not
think
of
anything
or
listen
to
anything
but
the
insults
and
injuries
she
had
received
from
hannah
and
her
burning
thirst
for
revenge
me
said
i
half
in
jest
you
hate
her
so
much
as
all
that
say
but
the
word
and
i
will
soon
rid
you
of
her
for
ever
i
had
not
the
least
idea
that
she
would
take
me
at
my
word
her
eyes
flashed
with
a
horrible
light
dare
not
do
it
she
replied
with
a
scornful
toss
of
her
head
not
do
what
that
woman
for
me
she
whispered
do
know
what
i
dare
or
what
i
do
said
i
drawing
a
little
back
from
her
you
will
promise
to
run
off
with
me
afterwards
i
will
see
what
i
can
do
with
her
do
anything
you
like
but
you
must
first
kill
her
are
not
in
earnest
grace
mean
what
i
say
shall
we
be
able
to
accomplish
it
she
is
away
now
and
she
may
not
return
before
her
master
comes
back
doubt
her
she
will
be
back
to
see
after
the
house
and
that
we
are
in
no
mischief
sleeps
with
you
always
she
will
will
wait
till
you
are
asleep
and
then
i
will
kill
her
with
a
blow
of
the
axe
on
the
head
it
will
be
over
in
a
minute
which
side
of
the
bed
does
she
lie
on
always
sleeps
on
the
side
nearest
the
wall
and
she
bolts
the
door
the
last
thing
before
she
puts
out
the
light
but
i
will
manage
both
these
difficulties
for
you
i
will
pretend
to
have
the
toothache
very
bad
and
will
ask
to
sleep
next
the
wall
she
is
kind
to
the
sick
and
will
not
refuse
me
and
after
she
is
asleep
i
will
steal
out
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
unbolt
the
door
if
you
are
true
to
your
promise
you
need
not
fear
that
i
shall
neglect
mine
i
looked
at
her
with
astonishment
god
thought
i
this
be
a
woman
a
pretty
woman
too
and
a
mere
girl
what
a
heart
she
must
have
i
felt
equally
tempted
to
tell
her
she
was
a
devil
and
that
i
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
such
a
horrible
piece
of
business
but
she
looked
so
handsome
that
somehow
or
another
i
yielded
to
the
temptation
though
it
was
not
without
a
struggle
for
conscience
loudly
warned
me
not
to
injure
one
who
had
never
injured
me
hannah
came
home
to
supper
and
she
was
unusually
agreeable
and
took
her
tea
with
us
in
the
kitchen
and
laughed
and
chatted
as
merrily
as
possible
and
grace
in
order
to
hide
the
wicked
thoughts
working
in
her
mind
was
very
pleasant
too
and
they
went
laughing
to
bed
as
if
they
were
the
best
friends
in
the
world
i
sat
by
the
kitchen
fire
after
they
were
gone
with
the
axe
between
my
knees
trying
to
harden
my
heart
to
commit
the
murder
but
for
a
long
time
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
do
it
i
thought
over
all
my
past
life
i
had
been
a
bad
disobedient
son
a
dishonest
wicked
man
but
i
had
never
shed
blood
i
had
often
felt
sorry
for
the
error
of
my
ways
and
had
even
vowed
amendment
and
prayed
god
to
forgive
me
and
make
a
better
man
of
me
for
the
time
to
come
and
now
here
i
was
at
the
instigation
of
a
young
girl
contemplating
the
death
of
a
with
whom
i
had
been
laughing
and
talking
on
apparently
friendly
terms
a
few
minutes
ago
oh
it
was
dreadful
too
dreadful
to
be
true
and
then
i
prayed
god
to
remove
the
temptation
from
me
and
to
convince
me
of
my
sin
but
whispered
the
devil
marks
will
laugh
at
you
she
will
twit
you
with
your
want
of
resolution
and
say
that
she
is
the
better
man
of
the
two
i
sprang
up
and
hastened
at
their
door
which
opened
into
the
kitchen
all
was
still
i
tried
the
door
for
the
damnation
of
my
soul
it
was
open
i
had
no
need
of
a
candle
the
moon
was
at
full
there
was
no
curtain
to
their
window
and
it
shone
directly
upon
the
bed
and
i
could
see
their
features
as
plainly
as
by
the
light
of
day
grace
was
either
sleeping
or
pretending
to
sleep
i
think
the
latter
for
there
was
a
sort
of
fiendish
smile
upon
her
lips
the
housekeeper
had
yielded
to
her
request
and
was
lying
with
her
head
out
over
the
in
the
best
possible
manner
for
receiving
a
upon
her
temples
she
had
a
sad
troubled
look
upon
her
handsome
face
and
once
she
moved
her
hand
and
said
dear
i
wondered
whether
she
was
dreaming
of
any
danger
to
herself
and
the
man
she
loved
i
raised
the
axe
to
give
the
but
my
arm
seemed
held
back
by
an
invisible
hand
it
was
the
hand
of
god
i
turned
away
from
the
bed
and
left
the
room
i
could
not
do
it
i
sat
down
by
the
embers
of
the
fire
and
cursed
my
own
folly
i
made
a
second
attempt
a
third
and
fourth
yes
even
to
a
ninth
and
my
purpose
was
each
time
defeated
god
seemed
to
fight
for
the
poor
creature
and
the
last
time
i
left
the
room
i
swore
with
a
great
oath
that
if
she
did
not
die
till
i
killed
her
she
might
live
on
till
the
day
of
judgment
i
threw
the
axe
on
to
the
wood
heap
in
the
shed
and
went
to
bed
and
soon
fell
fast
asleep
in
the
morning
i
was
coming
into
the
kitchen
to
light
the
fire
and
met
grace
marks
with
the
pails
in
her
hand
going
out
to
milk
the
cows
as
she
passed
me
she
gave
me
a
poke
with
the
pail
in
the
ribs
and
whispered
with
a
sneer
you
a
coward
as
she
uttered
those
words
the
devil
against
whom
i
had
fought
all
night
entered
into
my
heart
and
transformed
me
into
a
demon
all
feelings
of
remorse
and
mercy
forsook
me
from
that
instant
and
darker
and
deeper
plans
of
murder
and
theft
flashed
through
my
brain
and
milk
the
cows
said
i
with
a
bitter
laugh
you
shall
soon
see
whether
i
am
the
coward
you
take
me
for
she
went
out
to
milk
and
i
went
in
to
murder
the
unsuspicious
housekeeper
i
found
her
at
the
sink
in
the
kitchen
washing
her
face
in
a
tin
basin
i
had
the
fatal
axe
in
my
hand
and
without
pausing
for
an
instant
to
change
my
mind
for
had
i
stopped
to
think
she
would
have
been
living
to
this
day
i
struck
her
a
heavy
blow
on
the
back
of
the
head
with
my
axe
she
fell
to
the
ground
at
my
feet
without
uttering
a
word
and
opening
the
that
led
from
the
kitchen
into
a
cellar
where
we
kept
potatoes
and
other
stores
i
hurled
her
down
closed
the
door
and
wiped
away
the
perspiration
that
was
streaming
down
my
face
i
then
looked
at
the
axe
and
laughed
i
have
tasted
blood
now
and
this
murder
will
not
be
the
last
grace
marks
you
have
raised
the
devil
take
care
of
yourself
now
she
came
in
with
her
pails
looking
as
innocent
and
demure
as
the
milk
they
contained
she
turned
pale
when
her
eye
met
mine
i
have
no
doubt
but
that
i
iooked
the
fiend
her
taunt
had
made
me
hannah
she
asked
in
a
faint
voice
said
i
are
you
turned
coward
now
you
look
dreadful
i
am
afraid
of
you
not
of
her
my
girl
you
should
have
thought
of
that
before
the
hound
that
laps
blood
once
will
lap
again
you
have
taught
me
how
to
kill
and
i
do
care
who
or
how
many
i
kill
now
when
kinnaird
comes
home
i
will
put
a
ball
through
his
brain
and
send
him
to
keep
company
below
with
the
housekeeper
she
put
down
the
pails
she
sprang
towards
me
and
clinging
to
my
arm
exclaimed
in
frantic
tones
wo
kill
him
i
will
why
should
he
escape
more
than
hannah
and
hark
you
girl
if
you
dare
to
breathe
a
word
to
any
one
of
my
intention
or
tell
to
any
one
by
word
or
sign
what
i
have
done
i
kill
you
she
trembled
like
a
leaf
yes
that
young
demon
trembled
kill
me
she
whined
kill
me
macdermot
i
swear
that
i
will
not
betray
you
and
oh
do
kill
him
why
the
devil
do
you
want
me
to
spare
him
is
so
handsome
to
you
come
grace
no
nonsense
if
i
had
thought
that
you
were
jealous
of
your
master
and
hannah
i
would
have
been
the
last
man
on
earth
to
have
killed
her
you
belong
to
me
now
and
though
i
believe
that
the
devil
has
given
me
a
bad
bargain
in
you
yet
such
as
you
are
i
will
stand
by
you
and
now
strike
a
light
and
follow
me
into
the
cellar
you
must
help
me
to
put
hannah
out
of
sight
she
never
shed
a
tear
but
she
looked
dogged
and
sullen
and
did
as
i
bid
her
that
cellar
presented
a
dreadful
spectacle
i
can
hardly
bear
to
recall
it
now
but
then
when
my
hands
were
still
red
with
her
blood
it
was
doubly
terrible
hannah
montgomery
was
not
dead
as
i
had
thought
the
blow
had
only
stunned
her
she
had
partially
recovered
her
senses
and
was
kneeling
on
one
knee
as
we
descended
the
ladder
with
the
light
i
do
know
if
she
heard
us
for
she
must
have
been
blinded
with
the
blood
that
was
flowing
down
her
face
but
she
certainly
heard
us
and
raised
her
clasped
hands
as
if
to
implore
mercy
i
turned
to
grace
the
expression
of
her
livid
face
was
even
more
dreadful
than
that
of
the
unfortunate
woman
she
uttered
no
cry
but
she
put
her
hand
to
her
head
and
said
has
damned
me
for
this
you
have
nothing
more
to
fear
says
i
me
that
handkerchief
off
your
neck
she
gave
it
without
a
word
i
threw
myself
upon
the
body
of
the
housekeeper
and
planting
my
knee
on
her
breast
i
tied
the
handkerchief
round
her
throat
in
a
single
tie
giving
grace
one
end
to
hold
while
i
drew
the
other
tight
enough
to
finish
my
terrible
work
her
eyes
literally
started
from
her
head
she
gave
one
groan
and
all
was
over
i
then
cut
the
body
in
four
pieces
and
turned
a
large
washtub
over
them
grace
you
may
come
up
and
get
my
breakfast
yes
m
you
will
not
perhaps
believe
me
yet
i
assure
you
that
we
went
upstairs
and
ate
a
good
breakfast
and
i
laughed
with
grace
at
the
consternation
the
captain
would
be
in
when
he
found
that
hannah
was
absent
during
the
morning
a
pedlar
called
who
travelled
the
country
with
articles
of
clothing
taking
farm
produce
in
exchange
for
his
wares
i
bought
of
him
two
good
shirts
which
had
been
stolen
from
some
gentleman
by
his
housekeeper
while
i
was
chatting
with
the
pedlar
i
remarked
that
grace
had
left
the
house
and
i
saw
her
through
the
talking
to
a
young
lad
by
the
well
who
often
came
across
to
borrow
an
old
gun
from
my
master
to
shoot
ducks
i
called
to
her
to
come
in
which
she
appeared
to
me
to
do
very
reluctantly
i
felt
that
i
was
in
her
power
and
i
was
horribly
afraid
of
her
betraying
me
in
order
to
save
her
own
and
the
captain
life
i
now
hated
her
from
my
very
soul
and
could
have
killed
her
without
the
least
pity
or
remorse
do
you
want
macdermot
she
said
sullenly
want
you
i
dare
not
trust
you
out
of
my
sight
i
know
what
you
are
you
are
plotting
mischief
against
me
but
if
you
betray
me
i
will
be
revenged
if
i
have
to
follow
you
to
for
that
purpose
do
you
doubt
my
word
macdermot
do
you
think
i
want
to
hang
myself
not
yourself
but
me
you
are
too
bad
to
be
trusted
what
were
you
saying
just
now
to
that
boy
told
him
that
the
captain
was
not
at
home
and
i
dared
not
lend
him
the
gun
were
right
the
gun
will
be
wanted
at
she
shuddered
and
turned
away
it
seems
that
she
had
had
enough
of
blood
and
shewed
some
feeling
at
last
i
kept
my
eye
upon
her
and
would
not
suffer
her
for
a
moment
out
of
my
sight
at
noon
the
captain
drove
into
the
yard
and
i
went
out
to
take
the
horse
before
he
had
time
to
alight
he
asked
for
hannah
i
told
him
that
she
was
out
that
she
went
off
the
day
before
and
had
not
returned
but
that
we
expected
her
in
every
minute
he
was
very
much
annoyed
and
said
that
she
had
no
business
to
leave
the
house
during
his
absence
that
he
would
give
her
a
good
rating
when
she
came
home
grace
asked
if
she
should
get
his
breakfast
he
said
wanted
none
he
would
wait
till
hannah
came
back
and
then
he
would
take
a
cup
of
coffee
he
then
went
into
the
parlour
and
throwing
himself
down
upon
the
sofa
commenced
reading
a
magazine
he
had
brought
with
him
from
toronto
thought
he
would
miss
the
young
lady
said
grace
has
no
idea
how
close
she
is
to
him
at
this
moment
i
wonder
why
i
could
not
make
him
as
good
a
cup
of
coffee
as
hannah
i
have
often
made
it
for
him
when
he
did
not
know
it
but
what
is
sweet
from
her
hand
would
be
poison
from
mine
but
i
have
had
my
revenge
dinner
time
came
and
out
came
the
captain
to
the
kitchen
book
in
hand
hannah
back
yet
sir
strange
which
way
did
she
go
did
not
tell
us
where
she
was
going
but
said
that
as
you
were
out
it
would
be
a
good
opportunity
of
visiting
an
old
friend
did
she
say
she
would
be
back
expected
her
last
night
said
grace
must
have
happened
to
the
girl
macdermot
turning
to
me
the
saddle
on
my
riding
horse
i
will
go
among
the
neighbours
and
inquire
if
they
have
seen
her
grace
exchanged
glances
with
me
you
not
stay
till
after
dinner
sir
do
care
he
cried
impatiently
for
dinner
i
feel
too
uneasy
about
the
girl
to
eat
macdermot
be
quick
and
saddle
charley
and
you
grace
come
and
tell
me
when
he
is
at
the
door
he
went
back
into
the
parlour
and
put
on
his
and
i
went
into
the
not
to
obey
his
orders
but
to
plan
his
destruction
i
perceived
that
it
was
more
difficult
to
conceal
a
murder
than
i
had
imagined
that
the
inquiries
he
was
about
to
make
would
arouse
suspicion
among
the
neighbours
and
finally
lead
to
a
discovery
the
only
way
to
prevent
this
was
to
murder
him
take
what
money
he
had
brought
with
him
from
toronto
and
be
off
with
grace
to
the
states
whatever
repugnance
i
might
have
felt
at
the
commission
of
this
fresh
crime
was
drowned
in
the
selfish
necessity
of
my
plans
were
soon
matured
and
i
hastened
to
put
them
in
a
proper
train
i
first
loaded
the
old
duck
gun
with
ball
and
putting
it
behind
the
door
of
the
i
went
into
the
parlour
i
found
the
captain
lyinig
on
the
sofa
reading
his
hat
and
gloves
beside
him
on
the
table
he
started
up
as
i
entered
the
horse
ready
yet
sir
some
person
has
been
in
during
the
night
and
cut
your
new
english
saddle
almost
to
pieces
i
wish
you
would
step
out
and
look
at
it
i
can
not
put
it
on
charley
in
its
present
state
bother
me
he
cried
angrily
is
in
your
charge
you
are
answerable
for
that
who
the
devil
would
think
it
worth
their
while
to
break
into
the
harness
house
to
cut
a
saddle
when
they
could
have
carried
it
off
entirely
let
me
have
none
of
your
tricks
sir
you
must
have
done
it
yourself
is
not
very
likely
captain
kinnaird
at
any
rate
it
would
be
a
satisfaction
to
me
if
you
would
come
and
look
at
it
in
too
great
a
hurry
put
on
the
old
one
i
still
held
the
door
in
my
hand
only
a
step
from
here
to
the
he
rose
reluctantly
and
followed
me
into
the
kitchen
the
formed
part
of
a
off
the
kitchen
and
you
went
down
two
steps
into
it
he
went
on
before
me
and
as
he
descended
the
steps
i
clutched
the
gun
i
had
left
behind
the
door
took
my
aim
between
his
shoulders
and
shot
him
through
the
heart
he
staggered
forward
and
fell
exclaiming
as
he
did
so
god
i
am
shot
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
lying
in
the
cellar
beside
our
other
victim
very
little
blood
flowed
from
the
wound
he
bled
internally
he
had
on
a
very
fine
shirt
and
after
rifling
his
person
and
possessing
myself
of
his
pocketbook
i
took
off
his
shirt
and
put
on
the
one
i
had
bought
of
the
pedlar
then
cried
mac
ie
to
whom
this
confession
was
made
that
was
how
the
pedlar
was
supposed
to
have
had
a
hand
in
the
murder
that
circumstance
confused
the
evidence
and
nearly
saved
your
life
it
was
just
as
i
have
told
you
said
macdermot
and
tell
me
macdermot
the
reason
of
another
circumstance
that
puzzled
the
whole
court
how
came
that
magazine
which
was
found
in
the
housekeeper
bed
saturated
with
blood
in
that
place
and
so
far
from
the
spot
where
the
murder
was
committed
that
too
is
easily
explained
though
it
was
such
a
riddle
to
you
gentlemen
of
the
law
when
the
captain
came
out
to
look
at
the
saddle
he
had
the
book
open
in
his
hand
when
he
was
shot
he
clapped
the
book
to
his
breast
with
both
his
hands
almost
all
the
blood
that
flowed
from
it
was
caught
in
that
book
it
required
some
force
on
my
part
to
take
it
from
his
grasp
after
he
was
dead
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
it
i
flung
it
into
the
housekeeper
bed
while
i
harnessed
the
into
his
new
buggy
grace
collected
all
the
valuables
in
the
house
you
know
sir
that
we
got
safe
on
board
the
steamer
at
toronto
but
owing
to
an
unfortunate
delay
we
were
apprehended
sent
to
jail
and
condemned
to
die
grace
you
tell
me
has
been
reprieved
and
her
sentence
commuted
into
confinement
in
the
penitentiary
for
life
this
seems
very
unjust
to
me
for
she
is
certainly
more
criminal
than
i
am
if
she
had
not
instigated
me
to
commit
the
murder
it
never
would
have
been
done
but
the
priest
tells
me
that
i
shall
not
be
hung
and
not
to
make
myself
uneasy
on
that
score
macdermot
said
mac
ie
it
is
useless
to
flatter
you
with
false
hopes
you
will
suffer
the
execution
of
your
sentence
at
eight
in
front
of
the
jail
i
have
seen
the
order
sent
by
the
governor
to
the
sheriff
and
that
was
my
reason
for
visiting
you
i
was
not
satisfied
in
my
own
mind
of
your
guilt
what
you
have
told
me
has
greatly
relieved
my
mind
and
i
must
add
if
ever
man
deserved
his
sentence
you
do
yours
when
this
unhappy
man
was
really
convinced
that
i
was
in
earnest
that
he
must
pay
with
his
life
the
penalty
of
his
crime
continued
mac
ie
his
abject
cowardice
and
the
mental
agonies
he
endured
were
too
terrible
to
witness
he
dashed
himself
on
the
floor
of
his
cell
and
shrieked
and
raved
like
a
maniac
declaring
that
he
could
not
and
would
not
die
that
the
law
had
no
right
to
murder
a
man
soul
as
well
as
his
body
by
giving
him
no
time
for
repentance
that
if
he
was
hung
like
a
dog
grace
marks
in
justice
ought
to
share
his
fate
finding
that
all
i
could
say
to
him
had
no
effect
in
producing
a
better
frame
of
mind
i
called
in
the
chaplain
and
left
the
sinner
to
his
fate
a
few
months
ago
i
visited
the
penitentiary
and
as
my
pleading
had
been
the
means
of
saving
grace
from
the
same
doom
i
naturally
felt
interested
in
her
present
state
i
was
permitted
to
see
and
speak
to
her
and
m
i
never
shall
forget
the
painful
feelings
i
experienced
during
this
interview
she
had
been
five
years
in
the
penitentiary
but
still
retained
a
remarkably
youthful
appearance
the
sullen
assurance
that
had
formerly
marked
her
countenance
had
given
place
to
a
sad
and
humbled
expression
she
had
lost
much
of
her
former
good
looks
and
seldom
raised
her
eyes
from
the
ground
grace
i
said
is
it
with
you
now
enough
sir
she
answered
with
a
sigh
ought
to
feel
grateful
to
you
for
all
the
trouble
you
took
on
my
account
i
thought
you
my
friend
then
but
you
were
the
worst
enemy
i
ever
had
in
my
life
is
that
grace
sir
it
would
have
been
better
for
me
to
have
died
with
macdermot
than
to
have
suffered
for
years
as
i
have
done
the
torments
of
the
damned
oh
sir
my
misery
is
too
great
for
words
to
describe
i
would
gladly
submit
to
the
most
painful
death
if
i
thought
that
it
would
put
an
end
to
the
pangs
i
daily
endure
but
though
i
have
repented
of
my
wickedness
with
bitter
tears
it
has
pleased
god
that
i
should
never
again
know
a
moment
peace
since
i
helped
macdermot
to
strangle
hannah
montgomery
her
terrible
face
and
those
horrible
bloodshot
eyes
have
never
left
me
for
a
moment
they
glare
upon
me
by
night
and
day
and
when
i
close
my
eyes
in
despair
i
see
them
looking
into
my
soul
it
is
impossible
to
shut
them
out
if
i
am
at
work
in
a
few
minutes
that
dreadful
head
is
in
my
lap
if
i
look
up
to
get
rid
of
it
i
see
it
in
the
far
corner
of
the
room
at
dinner
it
is
in
my
plate
or
grinning
between
the
persons
who
sit
opposite
to
me
at
table
every
object
that
meets
my
sight
takes
the
same
dreadful
form
and
at
night
at
night
in
the
silence
and
loneliness
of
my
cell
those
blazing
eyes
make
my
prison
as
light
as
day
no
not
as
day
they
have
a
terribly
hot
glare
that
has
not
the
appearance
of
anything
in
this
world
and
when
i
sleep
that
face
just
hovers
above
my
own
its
eyes
just
opposite
to
mine
so
that
when
i
awake
with
a
shriek
of
agony
i
find
them
there
oh
this
is
hell
sir
these
are
the
torments
of
the
damned
were
i
in
that
fiery
place
my
punishment
could
not
be
greater
than
this
the
poor
creature
turned
away
and
i
left
her
for
who
could
say
a
word
of
comfort
to
such
grief
it
was
a
matter
solely
between
her
own
conscience
and
god
having
heard
this
terrible
narrative
i
was
very
anxious
to
behold
this
unhappy
victim
of
remorse
she
passed
me
on
the
stairs
as
i
proceeded
to
the
part
of
the
building
where
the
women
were
kept
but
on
perceiving
a
stranger
she
turned
her
head
away
so
that
i
could
not
get
a
glimpse
of
her
face
having
made
known
my
wishes
to
the
matron
she
very
kindly
called
her
in
to
perform
some
trifling
duty
in
the
ward
so
that
i
might
have
an
opportunity
of
seeing
her
she
is
a
woman
with
a
slight
graceful
figure
there
is
an
air
of
hopeless
melancholy
in
her
face
which
is
very
painful
to
contemplate
her
complexion
is
fair
and
must
before
the
touch
of
hopeless
sorrow
paled
it
have
been
very
brilliant
her
eyes
are
a
bright
blue
her
hair
auburn
and
her
face
would
be
rather
handsome
were
it
not
for
the
long
curved
chin
which
gives
as
it
always
does
to
most
persons
who
have
this
facial
defect
a
cunning
cruel
expression
grace
marks
glances
at
you
with
a
sidelong
stealthy
look
her
eye
never
meets
yours
and
after
a
furtive
regard
it
invariably
bends
its
gaze
upon
the
ground
she
looks
like
a
person
rather
above
her
humble
station
and
her
conduct
during
her
stay
in
the
penitentiary
was
so
unexceptionable
that
a
petition
was
signed
by
all
the
influential
gentlemen
in
kingston
which
released
her
from
her
long
imprisonment
she
entered
the
service
of
the
governor
of
the
penitentiary
but
the
fearful
hauntings
of
her
brain
have
terminated
in
madness
she
is
now
in
the
asylum
at
toronto
and
as
i
mean
to
visit
it
when
there
i
may
chance
to
see
this
remarkable
criminal
again
let
us
hope
that
all
her
previous
guilt
may
be
attributed
to
the
incipient

stern
spirit

thy

rends
the

earth
trembles
with
dread
in
hoarse
hollow

the
billows
reply

ocean
is
roused
in

crouch
in

shakes

around

the

omnipotence
rode
on
the

from
the

he
spake
when
man
wrung
with
pain
in
the
strength
of
his
anguish
dare
challenge
his
god

he
told

at

xi
michael
macbride
his
day
of
life
is
closing
the
long
night
of
dreamless
rest
a
dusky
shadow
throws
between
the
dying
and
the
things
of
earth
enfolding
in
a
chill
oblivious
pall
the
last
sad
struggles
of
a
broken
heart
yes
ere
the
rising
of
sun
the
bitter
grief
that
brought
him
to
this
pass
will
be
forgotten
in
the
sleep
of
death
we
left
kingston
at
three
in
the
passport
for
toronto
from
her
commander
captain
towhy
a
fine
british
heart
of
oak
we
received
the
kindest
attention
his
intelligent
conversation
and
interesting
descriptions
of
the
many
lands
he
had
visited
during
a
long
acquaintance
with
the
sea
greatly
lightening
the
tedium
of
the
voyage
when
once
fairly
afloat
on
the
broad
blue
inland
sea
of
ontario
you
soon
lose
sight
of
the
shores
and
could
imagine
yourself
sailing
on
a
calm
day
on
the
wide
ocean
there
is
something
however
wanting
to
complete
the
deception
the
invigorating
freshness
the
peculiar
smell
of
the
salt
water
that
is
so
exhilarating
and
which
produces
a
sensation
of
freedom
and
power
that
is
never
experienced
on
these
lakes
they
want
the
depth
the
fulness
the
grandeur
of
the
ocean
though
the
wide
expanse
of
water
and
sky
are
in
all
other
respects
the
same
the
boat
seldom
touches
at
any
place
before
she
reaches
cobourg
which
is
generally
at
night
we
stopped
a
short
time
at
the
wharf
to
put
passengers
and
freight
on
shore
and
to
receive
fresh
passengers
and
freight
in
return
the
sight
of
this
town
which
i
had
not
seen
for
many
years
recalled
forcibly
to
my
mind
a
melancholy
scene
in
which
i
chanced
to
be
an
actor
i
will
relate
it
here
when
we
first
arrived
in
canada
in
we
remained
for
three
weeks
at
an
hotel
in
this
town
though
at
that
period
it
was
a
place
of
much
less
importance
than
it
is
at
present
deserving
little
more
than
the
name
of
a
pretty
rising
village
pleasantly
situated
on
the
shores
of
lake
ontario
the
rapid
improvement
of
the
country
has
converted
cobourg
into
a
thriving
populous
town
and
it
has
trebled
its
population
during
the
lapse
of
twenty
years
a
residence
in
a
house
of
public
entertainment
to
those
who
have
been
accustomed
to
the
quiet
and
retirement
of
a
country
life
is
always
unpleasant
and
to
strangers
as
we
were
in
a
foreign
land
it
was
doubly
repugnant
to
our
feelings
in
spite
of
all
my
wise
resolutions
not
to
give
way
to
despondency
but
to
battle
bravely
against
the
change
in
my
circumstances
i
found
myself
daily
yielding
up
my
whole
heart
and
soul
to
that
worst
of
all
maladies
it
was
during
these
hours
of
loneliness
and
dejection
while
my
husband
was
absent
examining
farms
in
the
neighbourhoods
that
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
form
an
quaintance
with
c
a
canadian
lady
who
boarded
with
her
husband
in
the
same
hotel
my
new
friend
was
a
young
woman
agreeable
in
person
and
perfectly
unaffected
in
her
manners
which
were
remarkably
frank
and
kind
hers
was
the
first
friendly
face
i
had
seen
in
the
colony
and
it
will
ever
be
remembered
by
me
with
affection
and
respect
one
afternoon
while
alone
in
my
chamber
getting
my
baby
a
little
girl
of
six
months
old
to
sleep
and
thinking
many
sad
thoughts
and
shedding
some
bitter
tears
for
the
loss
of
the
dear
country
and
friends
i
had
left
for
ever
a
slight
tap
at
the
door
roused
me
from
my
painful
reveries
and
c
entered
the
room
like
most
of
the
canadian
women
my
friend
was
small
of
stature
slight
and
delicately
formed
and
dressed
with
the
smartness
and
neatness
so
characteristic
of
the
females
of
this
continent
who
if
they
lack
some
of
the
accomplishments
of
english
women
far
surpass
them
in
their
taste
in
dress
their
choice
of
colours
and
the
graceful
and
becoming
manner
in
which
they
wear
their
clothes
if
my
young
friend
had
a
weakness
it
was
on
this
point
but
as
her
husband
was
engaged
in
a
lucrative
mercantile
business
and
they
had
no
family
it
was
certainly
excusable
at
this
moment
her
pretty
neat
little
figure
was
a
welcome
and
interesting
object
to
the
emigrant
what
always
in
tears
said
she
carefully
closing
the
door
what
pleasure
it
would
give
me
to
see
you
more
cheerful
this
constant
repining
will
never
do
the
sight
of
you
has
made
me
feel
better
already
said
i
wiping
my
eyes
and
trying
to
force
a
smile
m
is
away
on
a
expedition
and
i
have
been
alone
all
day
can
you
wonder
then
that
i
am
so
depressed
memory
is
my
worst
companion
for
by
constantly
recalling
scenes
of
past
happiness
she
renders
me
discontented
with
the
present
and
hopeless
of
the
future
and
it
will
require
all
your
kind
sympathy
to
reconcile
me
to
canada
you
will
like
it
better
by
and
by
a
new
country
always
improves
upon
acquaintance
ah
never
did
i
only
consult
my
own
feelings
i
would
be
off
by
the
next
for
england
but
then
my
husband
my
child
our
scanty
means
yes
yes
i
must
submit
but
i
find
it
a
hard
task
we
have
all
our
trials
m
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
do
not
feel
in
the
best
spirits
myself
this
afternoon
i
came
to
ask
you
what
i
am
certain
you
will
consider
a
strange
question
this
was
said
in
a
tone
so
unusually
serious
that
i
looked
up
from
the
cradle
in
surprise
which
her
solemn
aspect
and
pale
tearful
face
did
not
tend
to
diminish
before
i
could
ask
the
cause
of
her
dejection
she
added
quickly
dare
you
read
a
chapter
from
the
bible
to
a
dying
man
dare
i
yes
certainly
who
is
ill
who
is
dying
it
a
sad
story
she
continued
wiping
the
tears
from
her
kind
eyes
i
will
tell
you
however
what
i
know
of
it
just
to
satisfy
you
as
to
the
propriety
of
my
request
there
is
a
poor
young
man
in
this
house
who
is
very
sick
dying
i
believe
of
consumption
he
came
here
about
three
weeks
ago
without
food
without
money
and
in
a
dreadfully
emaciated
state
he
took
our
good
landlord
s
on
one
side
and
told
him
how
he
was
situated
and
begged
that
he
would
give
him
something
to
eat
and
a
night
lodging
promising
that
if
ever
he
was
restored
to
health
he
would
repay
the
debt
in
work
you
know
what
a
kind
humane
man
s
is
although
she
added
with
a
sly
smile
is
a
and
so
am
i
by
right
of
parentage
though
not
of
birth
s
saw
at
a
glance
that
the
suppliant
was
an
object
of
real
charity
and
instantly
complied
with
his
request
without
asking
further
particulars
he
gave
him
a
good
bed
sent
him
up
a
bowl
of
hot
soup
and
bade
him
not
distress
himself
about
the
future
but
try
and
get
a
good
night
rest
the
next
day
the
young
man
was
too
ill
to
leave
his
chamber
s
sent
for
old
morton
who
after
examining
the
lad
informed
his
employer
that
he
was
in
the
last
stage
of
consumption
and
had
not
many
days
to
live
and
it
would
be
advisable
for
s
to
have
him
removed
to
the
hospital
a
pitiful
shed
erected
for
emigrants
who
may
chance
to
arrive
ill
with
the
cholera
s
not
only
refused
to
send
the
young
man
away
but
has
nursed
him
with
the
greatest
care
his
wife
and
daughters
taking
it
by
turns
to
sit
up
nightly
with
the
poor
patient
my
friend
said
nothing
about
her
own
attendance
on
the
invalid
which
i
afterwards
learned
from
s
had
been
unremitting
and
what
account
does
the
lad
give
of
himself
said
i
all
that
we
know
about
him
is
that
his
name
is
macbride
michael
macbride
was
not
the
real
name
of
this
poor
young
man
but
is
one
substituted
by
the
author
and
that
he
is
nephew
to
c
of
peterboro
an
irishman
by
birth
and
a
catholic
by
religion
some
violent
altercation
took
place
between
him
and
his
uncle
a
short
time
ago
which
induced
michael
to
leave
his
house
and
look
out
for
a
situation
for
himself
hearing
that
his
parents
had
arrived
in
this
country
and
were
on
their
way
to
peterboro
he
came
down
as
far
as
cobourg
in
the
hope
of
meeting
them
when
his
steps
were
arrested
by
poverty
and
sickness
on
this
threshold
by
a
singular
coincidence
his
mother
came
to
the
hotel
yesterday
evening
to
inquire
the
way
to
peterboro
and
s
found
out
from
her
conversation
that
she
was
the
mother
of
the
poor
lad
and
he
instantly
conducted
her
to
the
bedside
of
her
son
i
was
sitting
with
him
when
the
interview
between
him
and
his
mother
took
place
and
i
assure
you
that
it
was
almost
too
much
for
my
nerves
his
joy
and
gratitude
were
so
great
at
once
more
beholding
his
parent
while
the
grief
and
distraction
of
the
poor
woman
on
seeing
him
in
a
dying
state
was
agonising
and
she
gave
vent
to
her
feelings
in
uttering
the
most
hearty
curses
against
the
country
and
the
persons
who
by
their
unkindness
had
been
the
cause
of
his
sickness
the
young
man
seemed
shocked
at
the
unfeminine
conduct
of
his
mother
and
begged
me
to
excuse
the
rude
manner
in
which
she
answered
me
says
he
is
ignorant
and
beside
herself
and
does
not
know
what
she
is
saying
or
doing
instead
of
expressing
the
least
gratitude
to
s
for
the
attention
bestowed
on
her
son
by
some
strange
perversion
of
intellect
she
seems
to
regard
him
and
us
as
his
especial
enemies
last
night
she
ordered
us
from
his
room
and
declared
that
her
was
not
going
to
die
like
a
surrounded
by
a
parcel
of
heretics
and
she
sent
off
a
man
on
horseback
for
the
priest
and
for
his
uncle
the
very
man
from
whose
house
he
fled
and
whom
she
accuses
of
being
the
cause
of
her
son
death
michael
anticipates
the
arrival
of
c
with
feelings
bordering
on
despair
and
prays
that
god
may
end
his
sufferings
before
he
reaches
cobourg
last
night
macbride
sat
up
with
michael
herself
and
would
not
allow
us
to
do
the
least
thing
for
him
this
morning
her
fierce
temper
seems
to
have
subsided
until
her
son
awoke
from
a
broken
and
feverish
sleep
and
declared
that
he
would
not
die
a
roman
catholic
and
earnestly
requested
s
to
send
for
a
protestant
clergyman
this
gave
rise
to
a
violent
scene
between
macbride
and
her
son
which
ended
in
s
sending
for
b
the
clergyman
of
our
village
who
unfortunately
had
left
this
morning
for
toronto
and
is
not
expected
home
for
several
days
michael
eagerly
asked
if
there
was
any
person
present
who
would
read
to
him
from
the
protestant
bible
this
excited
in
the
mother
such
a
fit
of
passion
that
none
of
us
dared
attempt
the
task
i
then
thought
of
you
that
as
a
perfect
stranger
she
might
receive
you
in
a
less
hostile
manner
if
you
are
not
afraid
to
encounter
the
fierce
old
woman
do
make
the
attempt
for
the
sake
of
the
dying
creature
who
languishes
to
hear
the
words
of
life
i
will
watch
the
baby
while
you
are
gone
she
is
asleep
and
needs
no
watching
i
will
go
as
you
seem
so
anxious
about
it
and
i
took
my
pocket
bible
from
the
table
but
you
must
go
with
me
for
i
do
not
know
my
way
in
this
strange
house
carefully
closing
the
door
upon
the
sleeping
child
i
followed
the
light
steps
of
c
along
the
passage
until
we
reached
the
head
of
the
main
staircase
then
turning
to
the
right
we
entered
the
large
public
ballroom
in
the
first
chamber
of
many
that
opened
into
this
spacious
apartment
we
found
the
object
that
we
sought
stretched
upon
a
low
bed
with
a
feather
fan
in
his
hand
to
keep
off
the
flies
that
hovered
in
tormenting
clusters
round
his
head
lay
the
dying
michael
macbride
the
face
of
the
young
man
was
wasted
by
disease
and
mental
anxiety
and
if
the
features
were
not
positively
handsome
they
were
well
and
harmoniously
defined
and
a
look
of
intelligence
and
sensibility
pervaded
his
countenance
which
greatly
interested
me
in
his
behalf
his
face
was
deathly
pale
as
pale
as
marble
and
his
large
sunken
eyes
shone
with
unnatural
brilliancy
their
long
dark
lashes
adding
an
expression
of
intense
melancholy
to
the
patient
endurance
of
suffering
that
marked
his
fine
countenance
his
nose
was
shrunk
and
drawn
in
about
the
nostrils
his
feverish
lips
apart
in
order
to
admit
a
free
passage
for
the
labouring
breath
their
bright
red
glow
affording
a
painful
contrast
to
the
ghastly
glitter
of
the
brilliant
white
teeth
within
the
thick
black
curls
that
clustered
round
his
high
forehead
were
moist
with
perspiration
and
the
same
cold
unwholesome
dew
trickled
in
large
drops
down
his
hollow
temples
it
was
impossible
to
mistake
these
signs
of
approaching
dissolution
it
was
evident
to
all
present
that
death
was
not
far
distant
an
indescribable
awe
crept
over
me
he
looked
so
tranquil
so
sublimed
by
suffering
that
i
felt
my
self
unworthy
to
be
his
teacher
michael
i
said
taking
the
long
thin
white
hand
that
lay
so
listlessly
on
the
coverlid
i
am
sorry
to
see
you
so
he
looked
at
me
attentively
for
a
few
do
not
say
sorry
rather
say
glad
i
am
glad
to
get
away
from
this
bad
world
young
as
i
am
i
am
so
weary
of
it
he
sighed
deeply
and
tears
filled
his
eyes
i
heard
that
you
wished
some
one
to
read
to
you
yes
the
bible
he
cried
trying
to
raise
himself
in
the
bed
while
his
eager
eyes
were
turned
to
me
with
an
earnest
imploring
expression
i
have
it
here
are
you
able
to
read
it
for
yourself
i
can
read
but
my
eyes
are
so
dim
the
shadows
of
death
float
between
me
and
the
world
i
can
no
longer
see
objects
distinctly
but
oh
madam
if
my
soul
were
light
i
should
not
heed
this
blindness
but
all
is
dark
here
laying
his
hand
on
his
breast
dark
as
the
grave
i
opened
the
sacred
book
but
my
own
tears
for
a
moment
obscured
the
page
while
i
was
revolving
in
my
own
mind
what
would
be
the
best
to
read
to
him
the
book
was
rudely
wrenched
from
my
hand
by
a
tall
gaunt
woman
who
just
then
entered
the
room
och
what
do
you
mane
by
disturbing
him
in
his
dying
moments
wid
yer
thrash
it
is
not
the
likes
o
you
that
shall
throuble
his
sowl
the
praste
will
come
and
administher
consolation
to
him
in
his
last
exthremity
michael
shook
his
head
and
turned
his
face
sorrowfully
to
the
wall
oh
mother
he
murmured
is
that
the
way
you
treat
the
lady
lady
or
no
lady
and
i
mane
no
disrispict
it
is
not
for
the
like
her
to
take
this
on
hersel
if
she
will
be
rading
let
her
rade
this
and
she
tried
to
force
a
book
of
devotional
prayers
into
my
hand
michael
raised
himself
and
with
an
impatient
gesture
exclaimed
not
that
not
that
it
speaks
no
comfort
to
me
i
will
not
listen
to
it
mother
mother
do
not
stand
between
me
and
my
god
i
know
that
you
love
me
that
what
you
do
is
done
for
the
best
but
the
voice
of
conscience
will
be
heard
above
your
voice
i
hunger
and
thirst
to
hear
the
word
as
it
stands
in
the
bible
and
i
can
not
die
in
peace
unsatisfied
for
the
love
of
christ
read
a
few
words
of
comfort
to
a
dying
sinner
here
the
mother
again
interposed
my
good
woman
i
said
gently
putting
her
back
you
hear
your
earnest
request
if
you
really
love
him
you
will
offer
no
opposition
to
his
wishes
it
is
not
a
question
of
creeds
that
is
here
to
be
determined
as
to
which
is
the
best
yours
or
mine
i
trust
that
all
the
faithful
followers
of
christ
however
named
hold
the
same
faith
and
will
be
saved
by
the
same
means
i
shall
make
no
comment
on
what
i
read
to
your
son
the
bible
is
its
own
interpreter
the
spirit
of
god
by
whom
it
was
dictated
will
make
it
clear
to
his
comprehension
michael
shall
i
commence
now
yes
he
replied
with
the
blessing
of
god
after
putting
up
a
short
prayer
i
commenced
reading
and
continued
to
do
so
until
night
taking
care
to
select
those
portions
of
scripture
most
applicable
to
his
case
never
did
human
creature
listen
with
more
earnestness
to
the
words
of
truth
often
he
repeated
whole
texts
after
me
clasping
his
hands
together
in
a
sort
of
ecstasy
while
tears
streamed
from
his
eyes
the
old
woman
glared
upon
me
from
a
far
corner
and
muttered
over
her
beads
as
if
they
were
a
spell
to
secure
her
against
some
diabolical
art
when
i
could
no
longer
see
to
read
michael
took
my
hand
and
said
with
great
earnestness
may
god
bless
you
madam
you
have
made
me
very
happy
it
is
all
clear
to
me
now
in
christ
alone
i
shall
obtain
mercy
and
forgiveness
for
my
sins
it
is
his
righteousness
and
not
any
good
works
of
my
own
that
will
save
me
death
no
longer
appears
so
dreadful
to
me
i
can
now
die
in
peace
you
believe
that
god
will
pardon
you
michael
for
christ
sake
but
have
you
forgiven
all
your
enemies
i
said
this
in
order
to
try
his
sincerity
for
i
had
heard
that
he
entertained
hard
thoughts
against
his
uncle
he
covered
his
face
with
his
thin
wasted
hands
and
did
not
answer
for
some
minutes
at
length
he
looked
up
with
a
calm
smile
upon
his
lips
and
said
yes
i
have
forgiven
all
even
oh
how
much
was
contained
in
the
stress
laid
so
strongly
and
sadly
upon
that
little
word
how
i
longed
to
hear
the
story
of
his
wrongs
from
his
own
lips
but
he
was
too
weak
and
exhausted
for
me
to
urge
such
a
request
just
then
morton
came
in
and
after
standing
for
some
minutes
at
the
regarding
his
patient
with
fixed
attention
he
felt
his
pulse
spoke
a
few
kind
words
gave
some
trifling
order
to
his
mother
and
c
and
left
the
room
struck
by
the
solemnity
of
his
manner
i
followed
him
into
the
outer
apartment
excuse
the
liberty
i
am
taking
morton
but
i
feel
deeply
interested
in
your
patient
is
he
better
or
worse
he
is
dying
i
did
not
wish
to
disturb
him
in
his
last
moments
i
can
be
of
no
further
use
to
him
poor
lad
it
a
pity
he
is
really
a
fine
young
fellow
i
had
judged
from
michael
appearance
that
he
had
not
long
to
live
but
i
felt
inexpressibly
shocked
to
find
his
end
so
near
on
returning
to
the
sick
room
michael
eagerly
asked
what
the
doctor
thought
of
him
i
did
not
answer
i
could
not
i
see
he
said
that
i
must
die
i
will
prepare
myself
for
it
if
i
live
until
the
morning
will
you
madam
come
and
read
to
me
again
i
promised
him
that
i
would
or
during
the
night
if
he
wished
it
i
feel
very
sleepy
he
said
i
have
not
slept
for
many
nights
but
for
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
thank
god
i
am
entirely
free
from
pain
it
is
very
good
of
him
to
grant
me
this
respite
his
mother
and
i
adjusted
his
pillows
and
in
a
few
seconds
he
was
slumbering
as
peacefully
as
a
little
child
the
feelings
of
the
poor
woman
seemed
softened
towards
me
and
for
the
first
time
since
i
entered
the
room
she
shed
tears
i
asked
the
age
of
her
son
she
told
me
that
he
was
she
wrung
my
hand
hard
as
i
left
the
room
and
thanked
me
for
my
kindness
to
her
poor
it
was
late
that
night
when
my
husband
returned
from
the
country
and
we
sat
for
several
hours
talking
over
our
affairs
and
discussing
the
soil
and
situation
of
the
various
farms
he
had
visited
during
the
day
it
was
past
twelve
when
we
retired
to
rest
but
my
sleep
was
soon
disturbed
by
some
one
coughing
violently
and
my
thoughts
instantly
reverted
to
michael
macbride
as
the
hoarse
sepulchral
sounds
echoed
through
the
large
empty
room
beyond
which
he
slept
the
coughing
continued
for
some
minutes
and
i
was
so
much
overcome
by
fatigue
and
the
excitement
of
the
evening
that
i
fell
asleep
and
did
not
awake
until
six
the
following
morning
anxious
to
hear
how
the
poor
invalid
had
passed
the
night
i
dressed
myself
and
hurried
to
his
chamber
on
entering
the
i
found
the
doors
and
windows
all
open
as
well
as
the
one
that
led
to
the
sick
man
chamber
my
foot
was
arrested
on
the
threshold
for
death
was
there
yes
that
fit
of
coughing
had
terminated
his
life
michael
had
expired
without
a
struggle
in
the
arms
of
his
mother
the
gay
broad
beams
of
the
sun
were
not
admitted
into
that
silent
room
the
window
was
open
but
the
green
blinds
were
carefully
closed
admitting
a
free
circulation
of
air
and
just
light
enough
to
render
the
objects
within
distinctly
visible
the
body
was
laid
out
upon
the
bed
enveloped
in
a
white
sheet
the
head
and
hands
alone
were
bare
all
traces
of
sorrow
and
disease
had
passed
away
from
the
majestic
face
that
interesting
in
life
now
looked
beautiful
and
holy
in
death
and
happy
for
the
seal
of
heaven
seemed
visibly
impressed
upon
the
pure
pale
brow
he
was
at
peace
and
though
tears
of
human
sympathy
for
a
moment
dimmed
my
sight
i
could
not
regret
that
it
was
so
while
i
still
stood
in
the
macbride
whom
i
had
not
observed
until
then
rose
from
her
knees
beside
the
bed
she
seemed
hardly
in
her
right
mind
and
began
talking
and
muttering
to
herself
och
hone
he
is
dead
my
fine
bhoy
is
dead
widout
a
praste
to
pray
wid
him
or
bless
him
in
the
last
hour
wid
none
of
his
frinds
and
relations
to
lamint
iver
him
or
wake
him
but
his
poor
heartbroken
mother
och

folk
nor

and
show

how
supple
you
are
then
laying
her
cheek
down
to
the
cold
cheek
of
the
dead
she
exclaimed
amid
broken
sobs
and
groans
oh
spake
to
me
spake
to
me
mike
my
own
mike
is
the
mother
that
axes
ye
there
was
a
deep
pause
when
the
bereaved
parent
again
broke
forth
mike

why
did
your
uncle
rare
you
like
a
jintleman
to
bring
you

did
you
lave
your
frinds
and
your
money
and
your
good
clothes
and
your
poor
owld
mother
convulsive
sobs
again
choked
her
utterance
she
flung
herself
upon
the
neck
of
the
corpse
and
bathed
the
face
and
hands
of
him
who
had
once
been
her
own
with
burning
tears
i
now
came
forward
and
offered
a
few
words
of
consolation
vain
all
in
vain
the
ear
of
sorrow
is
deaf
to
all
save
its
own
agonised
moans
grief
is
as
natural
to
the
human
mind
as
joy
and
in
their
own
appointed
hour
both
will
have
their
way
the
grief
of
this
unhappy
irish
mother
like
the
of
a
thunder
shower
could
not
be
restrained
but
her
tears
soon
flowed
in
less
violent
gushes
exhaustion
rendered
her
more
calm
she
sat
upon
the
bed
and
looked
cautiously
round
hist
did
not
you
hear
a
voice
it
was
him
who
spake
yes
it
was
his
own
swate
voice
i
knew
he
was
not
dead
see
he
moves
this
was
the
fond
vain
delusion
of
maternal
love
she
took
his
cold
hand
and
clasped
it
to
her
heart
och
hone
he
is
gone
and
left
me
for
ever
and
ever
oh
that
my
cruel
brother
was
here
that
i
might
point
to
my
murthered
child
and
curse
him
to
his
face

i
taking
this
opportunity
to
divert
her
grief
into
another
channel

jintleman
our
landlord

a
liking
for
the
bhoy
and
gave
him
the
manes
to
emigrate
to
canady
this
vexed
my
father
intirely
for
he
had
no
one
barring
myself
to
help
him
on
the
farm
well
by
and
by
i
joined
myself
to
one
whom
my
father
did
not
approve

had
hired
to
work
wid
him
in
the
fields

since
i
was
a
wee
thing
to
ax
him
in
what

disobedience
and
he
jist
advises
him
to
turn

off

place
i
suffered
wid
my
husband
the
extremes
of
poverty
we
had
seven
childer
but
they
all
died
of
the
faver
and
hard
times
save
mike
and
the
two
weeny
ones
in
the
midst
of
our
disthress
it
plased
the
lord
to
remove
my
father
widout
his
heart
towards
me
but
he
left
my
mike
three
hunder
pounds
to
be
his
whin
he
came
to
a
right
age
and
he
appointed
my
brother
pat
guardian
to
the
bhoy

to
ireland
when

got
the
news
of
my

in
order
to

was
to

to
see
a

long
burst
of
passionate
weeping

her
story
many
long
years
came
an
wint
and
we
niver

the
scrape
of
a
pen
from
my
brother

all
at

might
jist
as
well
have
been

conthrary
but

thought
that

with
bitterness
it
was
the
gowld
the
dhirty
gowld
that
kilt
my
poor
bhoy
his
uncle
knew
that
if
mike
were
dead
it
would
come
to
pat
as
the
in
degree
an
he
could
keep
it
all
to
himsel
for
the
ten
years
this
statement
appeared
only
too
probable
still
there
was
a
mystery
about
the
whole
affair
that
required
a
solution
and
it
was
several
years
before
i
accidentally
learned
the
sequel
of
this
sad
history
in
the
meanwhile
the
messenger
despatched
by
the
kind
s
to
peterboro
to
inform
michael
uncle
of
the
dying
state
of
his
nephew
returned
without
that
worthy
and
with
this
unfeeling
message
that
michael
macbride
had
left
him
without
any
just
cause
and
should
receive
no
consolation
from
him
in
his
last
moments
s
did
not
inform
the
poor
bereaved
widow
of
her
brother
cruel
message
but
finding
that
she
was
unable
to
defray
the
expenses
attendant
on
her
son
funeral
like
a
true
samaritan
he
supplied
them
out
of
his
own
pocket
and
followed
the
remains
of
the
unhappy
stranger
that
providence
had
cast
upon
his
charity
to
the
grave
in
accordance
with
michael
last
request
he
was
buried
in
the
cemetry
of
the
english
church
six
years
after
these
events
took
place
w
called
upon
me
at
our
place
in
douro
and
among
other
things
told
me
of
the
death
of
uncle
c
many
things
were
mentioned
by
w
who
happened
to
know
him
to
his
disadvantage
but
of
all
his
evil
acts
he
said
the
worst
thing
i
knew
of
him
was
his
conduct
to
his
nephew
how
was
that
said
i
as
the
of
michael
macbride
rose
distinctly
before
me
it
was
a
bad
business
my
housekeeper
lived
with
the
old
man
at
the
time
and
from
her
i
heard
all
about
it
it
seems
that
he
had
been
left
guardian
to
this
boy
whom
he
brought
out
with
him
some
years
ago
to
this
country
together
with
a
little
girl
about
two
years
younger
who
was
the
child
of
a
daughter
of
his
mother
by
a
former
marriage
so
that
the
children
were
to
each
other
elizabeth
was
a
modest
clever
little
creature
and
grew
up
a
very
pretty
girl
michael
was
strikingly
handsome
had
a
fine
talent
for
music
and
in
person
and
manners
was
far
above
his
condition
there
was
some
property
to
the
amount
of
several
hundred
pounds
coming
to
the
lad
when
he
reached
the
age
of
this
legacy
had
been
left
him
by
his
grandfather
and
c
was
to
invest
it
in
land
for
the
boy
use
this
for
reasons
best
known
to
himself
he
neglected
to
do
and
brought
the
lad
up
to
the
service
of
the
altar
and
continually
urged
him
to
become
a
priest
this
did
not
at
all
accord
with
michael
views
and
wishes
and
he
obstinately
refused
to
study
for
the
holy
office
and
told
his
uncle
that
he
meant
to
become
a
farmer
as
soon
as
he
obtained
his
majority
living
constantly
in
the
same
house
and
possessing
a
congeniality
of
tastes
and
pursuits
a
strong
affection
had
grown
up
between
michael
and
his
cousin
which
circumstance
proved
the
ostensible
reason
given
by
c
for
his
ill
conduct
to
the
young
people
as
by
the
laws
of
his
church
they
were
too
near
of
kin
to
marry
finding
that
their
attachment
was
too
strong
to
be
wrenched
asunder
by
threats
and
that
they
had
actually
formed
a
design
to
leave
him
and
embrace
the
protestant
faith
he
confined
the
girl
to
her
chamber
without
allowing
her
a
fire
during
a
very
severe
winter
her
constitution
naturally
weak
sunk
under
these
trials
and
she
died
early
in
the
spring
of
without
being
allowed
the
melancholy
satisfaction
of
seeing
her
lover
before
she
closed
her
brief
life
her
death
decided
michael
fate
rendered
desperate
by
grief
he
reproached
his
bigoted
uncle
as
the
author
of
his
misery
and
demanded
of
him
a
settlement
of
his
property
as
it
was
his
intention
to
quit
his
roof
for
ever
c
laughed
at
his
reproaches
and
treated
his
threats
with
scorn
and
finally
cast
him
friendless
upon
the
world
the
poor
fellow
played
very
well
upon
the
flute
and
possessed
an
excellent
tenor
voice
and
by
the
means
of
these
accomplishments
he
contrived
for
a
few
weeks
to
obtain
a
precarious
living
and
alone
in
the
world
he
soon
fell
a
victim
to
hereditary
disease
of
the
lungs
and
died
i
have
been
told
at
an
hotel
in
cobourg
and

latter
part
of
your
statement
i
know
to
be
correct
and
the
whole
of
it
forcibly
corroborates
the
account
given
to
me
by
the
poor
mother
i
was
at
michael
deathbed
and
if
his
life
was
replete
with
sorrow
and
injustice
his
last
hours
were
peaceful
and
happy
i
could
now
fully
comprehend
the
meaning
of
the
sad
stress
laid
upon
the
one
word
which
had
struck
me
so
forcibly
at
the
time
when
i
asked
him
if
he
had
forgiven
his
enemies
and
he
replied
after
that
lengthened
pause
yes
i
have
forgiven
them
all
even
it
did
indeed
require
some
exertion
of
christian
forbearance
to
forgive
such
injuries

through

on

course
to
toronto
i
will
relate
another
true
but
mournful
history
from
the
romance
of
real
life
that
was
told
to
me
during
my
residence
in
this
part
of
the
country
one
morning
our
james
n
came
to
me
to
request
the
loan
of
one
of
the
horses
to
attend
a
funeral
m
was
absent
on
business
at
toronto
and
the
horses
and
the
man
time
were
both
greatly
needed
to
prepare
the
land
for
the
full
crop
of
wheat
i
demurred
james
looked
anxious
and
disappointed
and
the
loan
of
the
horse
was
at
length
granted
but
not
without
a
strict
injunction
that
he
should
return
to
his
work
directly
the
funeral
was
over
he
did
not
come
back
until
late
that
evening
i
had
just
finished
my
tea
and
was
nursing
my
wrath
at
his
staying
out
the
whole
day
when
the
door
of
the
room
we
had
but
one
and
that
was
shared
in
common
with
the
servants
opened
and
the
delinquent
at
last
appeared
he
hung
up
the
new
english
saddle
and
sat
down
before
the
blazing
hearth
without
speaking
a
word
what
detained
you
so
long
james
you
ought
to
have
had
half
an
acre
of
land
at
least
ploughed

funeral

but
nane
o
mine
ain

i
never
felt
sae
sad
in
a
my
life
as
i
dune
this
day
i
seen
the
clods
piled
on
mony
a
heid
an
never
felt
the
saut
tear
in
my
een
but
puir
jeanie
puir
lass
it
was
a
sair
sight
to
see
them
thrown
down
upon
her
my
curiosity
was
excited
i
pushed
the
from
me
and
told
bell
my
maid
to
give
james
his
supper
naething
for
me
the
night
bell
i
canna
eat
my
thoughts
will
a
run
on
that
puir
lass
sae
young
sae
bonnie
an
a
few

ago
as
blythe
as
a

an
noo
a
clod
o
the
airth

we
maun
a
dee
when
our
ain
time
comes
but
somehow
i
canna
think
that
jeanie
ought
to
gane
sae
sune
who
is
jeanie
burns
tell
me
james
something
about
her
in
compliance
with
my
request
the
man
gave
me
the
following
story
i
wish
i
could
convey
it
in
his
own
words
but
though
i
perfectly
understand
the
scotch
dialect
when
i
hear
it
spoken
i
could
not
write
it
in
its
charming
simplicity
that
honest
truthful
brevity
which
is
so
characteristic
of
this
noble
people
the
smooth
tones
of
the
blarney
may
flatter
our
vanity
and
please
us
for
the
moment
but
who
places
any
confidence
in
those
by
whom
it
is
employed
we
know
that
it
is
only
uttered
to
cajole
and
deceive
and
when
the
novelty
wears
off
the
repetition
awakens
indignation
and
disgust
but
who
mistrusts
the
blunt
straightforward
speech
of
the
land
of
burns
for
good
or
ill
it
strikes
home
to
the
heart
jeanie
burns
was
the
daughter
of
a
respectable
shoemaker
who
gained
a
comfortable
living
by
his
trade
in
a
small
town
of
ayrshire
her
father
like
herself
was
an
only
child
and
followed
the
same
vocation
and
wrought
under
the
same
roof
that
his
father
had
done
before
him
the
elder
burns
had
met
with
many
reverses
and
now
helpless
and
blind
was
entirely
dependent
upon
the
charity
of
his
son
honest
jock
had
not
married
until
late
in
life
that
he
might
more
comfortably
provide
for
the
wants
of
his
aged
parents
his
mother
had
been
dead
for
some
years
she
was
a
good
pious
woman
and
jock
quaintly
affirmed
that
it
had
pleased
the
lord
to
provide
a
better
inheritance
for
his
dear
auld
mither
than
his
arm
could
win
proud
an
happy
as
he
wud
been
to
supported
her
when
she
was
nae
langer
able
to
work
for
him
jock
filial
love
was
repaid
at
last
chance
threw
in
his
way
a
cannie
young
lass
baith
gude
an
bonnie
an
wi
a
hantel
o
siller
they
were
united
and
jeanie
was
the
sole
fruit
of
the
marriage
but
jeanie
proved
a
host
in
herself
and
grew
up
the
the
prettiest
and
the
most
industrious
girl
in
the
village
and
was
a
general
favourite
with
young
and
old
she
helped
her
mother
in
the
house
bound
shoes
for
her
father
and
attended
to
all
the
wants
of
her
dear
old
grandfather
saunders
burns
who
was
so
much
attached
to
his
little
handmaid
that
he
was
never
happy
when
she
was
absent
happiness
however
is
not
a
flower
of
long
growth
in
this
world
it
requires
the
dew
and
sunlight
of
heaven
to
nourish
it
and
it
soon
withers
removed
from
its
native
skies
the
cholera
visited
the
remote
village
it
smote
the
strong
man
in
the
pride
of
his
strength
and
the
matron
in
the
beauty
of
her
prime
while
it
spared
the
helpless
and
the
aged
the
infant
of
a
few
days
and
the
patriarch
of
many
years
both
jeanie
parents
fell
victims
to
the
fatal
disease
and
the
old
blind
saunders
and
the
young
jeanie
were
left
to
fight
alone
a
hard
battle
with
poverty
and
grief
the
truly
deserving
are
never
entirely
forsaken
god
may
afflict
them
with
many
trials
but
he
watches
over
them
still
and
often
provides
for
their
wants
in
a
manner
truly
miraculous
sympathizing
friends
gathered
round
the
orphan
girl
in
her
hour
of
need
and
obtained
for
her
sufficient
employment
to
enable
her
to
support
her
old
grandfather
and
herself
and
provide
for
them
the
common
necessaries
of
life
jeanie
was
an
excellent
sempstress
and
what
between
making
waistcoats
and
trousers
for
the
tailors
and
binding
shoes
for
the
shoemakers
a
business
that
she
thoroughly
understood
she
soon
had
her
little
hired
room
neatly
furnished
and
her
grandfather
as
clean
and
spruce
as
ever
when
she
led
him
into
the
kirk
of
a
sabbath
morning
all
the
neighbours
greeted
the
dutiful
daughter
with
an
approving
smile
and
the
old
man
looked
so
serene
and
happy
that
jeanie
was
fully
repaid
for
her
labours
of
love
her
industry
and
piety
often
formed
the
theme
of
conversation
to
the
young
lads
of
the
village
what
a
guid
wife
jeanie
burns
wull
mak
cried
one

said
another
he

add
with
a
sigh

an
she
were
mine
willie
robertson
was
a
fine
active
young
man
who
bore
an
excellent
character
and
his
comrades
thought
it
very
likely
that
willie
was
to
be
the
fortunate
man
robertson
was
the
son
of
a
farmer
in
the
neighbourhood
he
had
no
land
of
his
own
and
he
was
the
youngest
of
a
very
large
family
from
a
boy
he
had
assisted
his
father
in
working
the
farm
for
their
common
maintenance
but
after
he
took
to
looking
at
jeanie
burns
at
kirk
instead
of
minding
his
prayers
he
began
to
wish
that
he
had
a
homestead
of
his
own
which
he
could
ask
jeanie
and
her
grandfather
to
share
he
made
his
wishes
known
to
his
father
the
old
man
was
prudent
a
marriage
with
jeanie
burns
offered
no
advantages
in
a
pecuniary
view
but
the
girl
was
a
good
honest
girl
of
whom
any
man
might
be
proud
he
had
himself
married
for
love
and
had
enjoyed
great
comfort
in
his
wife
willie
my
lad
he
said
i
canna

a
share
o
the
farm

is

the
mony

the
woods
of

there
is
plenty

its

reward
if
jeanie
burns
you
as
weel
as
your
dear
mither
did
me
she
will
be
fain
to
follow
you
there
willie
grasped
his
father
hand
for
he
was
too
much
elated
to
speak
and
he
ran
away
to
tell
his
tale
of
love
to
the
girl
of
his
heart
jeanie
had
long
loved
robertson
in
secret
and
they
were
not
long
in
settling
the
matter
they
forgot
in
their
first
moments
of
joy
that
old
saunders
had
to
be
consulted
for
they
had
determined
to
take
the
old
man
with
them
but
here
an
obstacle
occurred
of
which
they
had
not
dreamed
old
age
is
selfish
and
saunders
obstinately
refused
to
comply
with
their
wishes
the
grave
that
held
the
remains
of
his
wife
and
son
was
dearer
to
him
than
all
the
comforts
promised
to
him
by
the
impatient
lovers
in
that
far
foreign
land
jeanie
wept
but
saunders
deaf
and
blind
neither
heard
nor
saw
her
grief
and
like
a
dutiful
child
she
breathed
no
complaint
to
him
but
promised
to
remain
with
him
until
his
head
rested
on
the
same
pillow
with
the
dead
this
was
a
sore
and
great
trial
to
willie
robertson
but
he
consoled
himself
for
the
disappointment
with
the
reflection
that
saunders
in
the
course
of
nature
could
not
live
long
and
that
he
would
go
and
prepare
a
place
for
his
jean
and
have
everything
ready
for
her
reception
against
the
old
man
died
i
was

were
amang
the
first
settlers
in

place
an
we
found
the
wark
before

rough
an
hard
to
our
heart
content
willie
however
had
a
strong
motive
for
exertion
an
neever

which
we
were
assisted
by
the

likewise
lent
a
han
in

comin
out

then
an

left

care

months
wi
auld

in

was
an
unco
guid
teamster
an
could
put
his
han
to
ony
kind
o
wark
an
when
his
term
o
service
expired
he
sent
jeanie
forty
dollars
to
pay

he
hoped
she
would
not
delay
longer
than
the
spring
he
got
an
answer
frae
jeanie
full
o
love
an
gratitude
but
she
thought
that
her
voyage
might
be
delayed
until
the
fall
the
guid
woman
with
whom
she
had
lodged
sin
her
parents
died
had
jest
lost
her

frin
to
jeanie
in
a
her
troubles
an
had
helped
her
to
nurse
the
auld
man
in
his
dyin
illness
i
am
sure
it
was
jest
like
jeanie
to
act
as
she
did
she
had
all
her
life
looked
more
to
the
comforts
of
others
than
to
her
ain
robertson
was
an
angry
man
when
he
got
that
letter
an
he
said
that
was
a
the
that
jeanie
burns
had
for
him
to
prefer
an
auld
wife
comfort
wha
was
naething
to
her
to
her
betrothed
husband
she
might
bide
awa
as
lang
as
she
pleased
he
would
never
fash
himsel
to
mak
screed
o
a
pen
to
her
agen
i
could
na
think
that
the
man
was
in
earnest
an
i
remonstrated
him
on
his
folly
an
injustice
this
ended
in
a
sharp
quarrel
atween
us
and
i
left
him
to
gang
his
ain
gate
an
went
to
live
with
my
uncle
who
kept
the
smithy
in
the
village
after
a
while
we
heard
that
willie
robertson
was
married
to
a
canadian
woman
neither
young
nor
an
varra
much
his
inferior
every
way
but

when
jeanie
burns
landed
in

travelled
her
lane
up
the
country
wonderin
why
willie
was
not
at

had
promised
in

late
in

brought
her
to
cobourg

without

respectin
him
she
hired
a
man
an
cart
to
take
her
an
her
luggage

the
road
through
the
bush

varra
heavy
an

was
a

had
received
an
loved
and
cherished
her
as
if
she
had
been
her
ain
bairn
for
two
whole
weeks
she
kept

an
was
sae
ill
that
the

and
when

did
come

agen
the

had
faded
aff
her

an
the
light
frae
her
sweet
blue
an
she
spak
in
a
low
subdued
voice
but
she
never
accused
him
o
being
the
cause
o
her

one
day
she
called
me
aside
and
said
you

how
i
an
trusted

obeyed
his
ain

in
comin
out
to
this

country
to

that
this
is
a
for

i
him

sae
sune
but
oh
ah
weel
i
maun
na

o
that
what
i
wud
jest
say
is
this
and
she
tuk
a
sma
packet
frae
her
breast
while
the
saut
tears
streamed
doon
her
pale
cheeks
sent
me
forty
dollars
to

we
all

that

after

we

a

chapter
xiii
lost
children
oh
how
i
love
the
pleasant
woods
when
silence
reigns
around
and
the
mighty
shadows
calmly
sleep
like
giants
on
the
ground
and
the
sports
her
fairy
lamp
beside
the
moonlit
stream
and
the
lofty
trees
in
solemn
state
frown
darkly
in
the
beam
there
was
a
poor
woman
on
board
the
steamer
who
was
like
myself
in
search
of
health
and
was
going
to
the
west
to
see
her
friends
and
to
get
rid
of
if
possible
a
hollow
consumptive
cough
she
looked
to
me
in
the
last
stage
of
pulmonary
consumption
but
she
seemed
to
hope
everything
from
the
change
of
air
she
had
been
for
many
years
a
resident
in
the
woods
and
had
suffered
great
hardships
but
the
greatest
sorrow
she
ever
knew
she
said
and
what
had
pulled
her
down
the
most
was
the
loss
of
a
fine
boy
who
had
strayed
away
after
her
through
the
bush
when
she
went
to
nurse
a
sick
neighbour
and
though
every
search
had
been
made
for
the
child
he
had
never
been
found
it
is
a
many
years
ago
she
said
and
he
would
be
a
fine
young
man
now
if
he
were
alive
and
she
sighed
deeply
and
still
seemed
to
cling
to
the
idea
that
he
might
possibly
be
living
with
a
sort
of
forlorn
hope
that
to
me
seemed
more
melancholy
than
the
certainty
of
his
death
this
brought
to
my
recollection
many
tales
that
i
had
been
told
while
living
in
the
bush
of
persons
who
had
perished
in
this
miserable
manner
some
of
these
tales
may
chance
to
interest
my
readers
i
was
busy
sewing
one
day
for
my
little
girl
when
we
lived
in
the
township
of
hamilton
when
h
a
woman
whose
husband
farmed
our
farm
on
shares
came
running
in
quite
out
of
breath
and
cried
out
m
you
have
heard
the
good
news
one
of
the
lost
children
is
found
i
shook
my
head
and
looked
inquiringly
what
did
not
you
hear
about
it
why
one
of
clark
little
fellows
who
were
lost
last
wednesday
in
the
woods
has
been
found
i
am
glad
of
it
but
how
were
they
lost
oh
is
a
thing
of
very
common
occurrence
here
new
settlers
who
are
ignorant
of
the
danger
of
going
astray
in
the
forest
are
always
having
their
children
lost
i
take
good
care
never
to
let
my
boys
go
alone
to
the
bush
but
people
are
so
careless
in
this
respect
that
i
wonder
it
does
not
more
frequently
happen
these
little
chaps
are
the
sons
of
a
poor
emigrant
who
came
out
this
summer
and
took
up
a
lot
of
wild
land
just
at
the
back
of
us
towards
the
plains
clark
is
busy
logging
up
his
fallow
for
fall
wheat
on
which
his
family
must
depend
for
bread
during
the
ensuing
year
and
he
is
so
anxious
to
get
it
ready
in
time
that
he
will
not
allow
himself
an
hour
at
noon
to
go
home
to
get
his
dinner
which
his
wife
generally
sends
in
a
basket
to
the
woods
by
his
eldest
daughter
a
girl
of
fourteen
last
wednesday
the
girl
had
been
sent
on
an
errand
by
her
mother
who
thought
that
in
her
absence
she
might
venture
to
trust
the
two
boys
to
take
the
dinner
to
their
father
the
boys
who
are
from
five
to
seven
years
old
and
very
smart
and
knowing
for
their
age
promised
to
mind
all
her
directions
and
went
off
quite
proud
of
the
task
carrying
the
little
basket
between
them
how
they
came
to
ramble
off
into
the
woods
the
younger
child
who
has
been
just
found
is
too
much
stupified
to
tell
and
perhaps
he
is
too
young
to
remember
at
night
clark
returned
from
his
work
and
scolded
his
wife
for
not
sending
his
dinner
as
usual
but
the
poor
woman
who
all
day
had
quieted
her
fears
with
the
belief
that
the
children
had
stayed
with
their
father
instead
of
paying
any
regard
to
his
angry
words
demanded
in
a
tone
of
agony
what
had
become
of
her
children
tired
and
hungry
as
clark
was
he
instantly
comprehended
the
danger
to
which
his
boys
were
exposed
and
started
off
in
pursuit
of
them
the
shrieks
of
the
distracted
woman
soon
called
the
neighbours
together
who
instantly
joined
in
the
search
it
was
not
until
this
afternoon
that
any
trace
could
be
discovered
of
the
lost
children
when
brian
the
hunter
found
the
youngest
boy
johnnie
lying
fast
asleep
upon
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
fifteen
miles
back
in
the
bush
and
the
brother
will
never
i
fear
be
heard
of
again
they
have
searched
for
him
in
all
directions
and
have
not
discovered
him
the
story
little
johnnie
tells
is
to
this
effect
during
the
first
two
days
of
their
absence
the
food
they
had
brought
in
the
basket
for
their
father
dinner
sustained
life
but
it
seems
that
little
johnnie
grew
very
hungry
and
cried
continually
for
bread
william
the
eldest
boy
promised
him
bread
if
he
would
try
and
walk
farther
but
his
feet
were
bleeding
and
sore
and
he
could
not
walk
another
step
for
some
time
the
other
little
fellow
carried
him
upon
his
back
but
growing
tired
himself
he
bade
johnnie
sit
down
upon
a
fallen
log
the
log
on
which
he
was
found
and
not
stir
from
the
place
until
he
came
back
he
told
the
child
that
he
would
run
on
until
he
found
a
house
and
would
return
as
soon
as
he
could
and
bring
him
something
to
eat
he
then
wiped
his
eyes
and
told
him
not
to
cry
and
not
to
be
scared
for
god
would
take
care
of
him
till
he
came
back
and
he
kissed
him
several
times
and
ran
away
this
is
all
the
little
fellow
knows
about
his
brother
and
it
is
very
probable
that
the
boy
has
been
eaten
by
the
wolves
that
are
very
plenty
in
that
part
of
the
forest
where
the
child
was
found
the
indians
traced
him
for
more
than
a
mile
along
the
banks
of
the
creek
when
they
lost
his
trail
altogether
if
he
had
fallen
into
the
water
it
is
so
shallow
that
they
could
scarcely
have
failed
in
discovering
the
body
but
they
think
that
he
has
been
dragged
into
some
hole
in
the
bank
among
the
tangled
cedars
and
devoured
since
i
have
been
in
the
country
continued
h
i
have
known
many
cases
of
children
and
even
of
grown
persons
being
lost
in
the
woods
who
were
never
heard
of
again
it
is
a
frightful
calamity
to
happen
to
any
one
for
should
they
escape
from
the
claws
of
wild
animals
these
dense
forests
contain
nothing
on
which
life
can
be
supported
for
any
length
of
time
the
very
boughs
of
the
trees
are
placed
so
far
from
the
ground
that
no
child
could
reach
or
climb
to
them
and
there
is
so
little
brush
and
small
bushes
among
these
giant
trees
that
no
sort
of
fruit
can
be
obtained
on
which
they
might
subsist
while
it
remained
in
season
it
is
only
in
clearings
or
where
the
fire
has
run
through
the
forest
that
strawberries
or
raspberries
are
to
be
found
and
at
this
season
of
the
year
and
in
the
winter
a
strong
man
could
not
exist
many
days
in
the
wilderness
let
alone
a
child
parents
can
not
be
too
careful
in
guarding
their
young
folks
against
rambling
alone
in
the
bush
persons
when
once
they
get
off
the
beaten
track
get
frightened
and
bewildered
and
lose
all
presence
of
mind
and
instead
of
remaining
where
they
are
when
they
first
discover
their
misfortune
which
is
the
only
chance
they
have
of
being
found
they
plunge
desperately
on
running
hither
and
thither
in
the
hope
of
getting
out
while
they
only
involve
themselves
more
deeply
among
the
mazes
of
the
interminable
forest
some
winters
ago
the
daughter
of
a
settler
in
the
remote
township
of
dummer
where
my
husband
took
up
his
grant
of
wild
land
and
in
which
we
lived
for
two
years
went
with
her
father
to
the
mill
which
was
four
miles
from
their
and
the
road
lay
entirely
through
the
bush
for
awhile
the
girl
who
was
about
twelve
years
of
age
kept
up
with
her
father
who
walked
briskly
ahead
with
his
bag
of
corn
on
his
back
for
as
their
path
lay
through
a
tangled
swamp
he
was
anxious
to
get
home
before
night
after
some
time
sarah
grew
tired
with
stepping
up
and
down
over
the
fallen
logs
that
strewed
their
path
and
lagged
a
long
way
behind
the
man
felt
not
the
least
apprehensive
when
he
lost
sight
of
her
expecting
that
she
would
soon
come
up
with
him
again
once
or
twice
he
stopped
and
shouted
and
she
answered
father
and
he
did
not
turn
to
look
after
her
again
he
reached
the
mill
saw
the
grist
ground
resumed
his
burden
and
took
the
road
home
expecting
to
meet
sarah
by
the
way
he
trod
the
long
path
alone
but
still
he
thought
that
the
girl
tired
with
her
walk
in
the
woods
had
turned
back
and
he
should
find
her
safe
at
home
you
may
imagine
m
his
consternation
and
that
of
the
family
when
they
found
that
the
girl
was
lost
it
was
now
dark
and
all
search
for
her
was
given
up
for
that
night
as
hopeless
by
the
next
morning
the
whole
settlement
which
was
then
confined
to
a
few
lonely
log
tenements
inhabited
solely
by
cornish
miners
were
roused
from
their
sleep
to
assist
in
the
search
the
men
turned
out
with
guns
and
horns
and
divided
into
parties
that
started
in
different
directions
those
who
first
discovered
sarah
were
to
fire
their
guns
which
was
to
be
the
signal
to
guide
the
rest
to
the
spot
it
was
not
long
before
they
found
the
object
of
their
search
seated
under
a
tree
about
half
a
mile
from
the
path
she
had
lost
on
the
preceding
day
she
had
been
tempted
by
the
beauty
of
some
wild
flowers
to
leave
the
road
and
when
once
in
the
forest
she
grew
bewildered
and
could
not
find
her
way
back
at
first
she
ran
to
and
fro
in
an
agony
of
terror
at
finding
herself
in
the
woods
all
alone
and
uttered
loud
and
frantic
cries
but
her
father
had
by
this
time
reached
the
mill
and
was
out
of
hearing
with
a
sagacity
beyond
her
years
and
not
very
common
to
her
class
instead
of
wandering
further
into
the
labyrinth
which
surrounded
her
she
sat
down
under
a
large
tree
covered
her
face
with
her
apron
said
the
lord
prayer
the
only
one
she
knew
and
hoped
that
god
would
send
her
father
back
to
find
her
the
moment
he
discovered
that
she
was
lost
when
night
came
down
upon
the
forest
and
oh
how
dark
night
is
in
the
woods
the
poor
girl
said
that
she
felt
horribly
afraid
of
being
eaten
by
the
wolves
that
abound
in
those
dreary
swamps
but
she
did
not
cry
for
fear
they
should
hear
her
simple
girl
she
did
not
know
that
the
scent
of
a
wolf
is
far
keener
than
his
ear
but
this
was
her
notion
and
she
lay
down
close
to
the
ground
and
never
once
uncovered
her
head
for
fear
of
seeing
something
dreadful
standing
beside
her
until
overcome
by
terror
and
fatigue
she
fell
fast
asleep
and
did
not
awake
till
roused
by
the
shrill
braying
of
the
horns
and
the
shouts
of
the
party
who
were
seeking
her
what
a
dreadful
situation
i
am
sure
that
i
should
not
have
had
the
courage
of
this
poor
girl
but
should
have
died
with
fear
we
do
know
how
much
we
can
bear
till
we
are
tried
this
girl
was
more
fortunate
than
a
boy
of
the
same
age
who
was
lost
in
the
same
township
just
as
the
winter
set
in
the
lad
was
sent
by
his
father
an
english
settler
in
company
with
two
boys
of
his
own
age
the
sons
of
neighbours
to
be
measured
for
a
pair
of
shoes
george
desne
who
followed
the
double
occupation
of
farmer
and
shoemaker
lived
about
three
miles
from
the
clearing
known
as
the
english
line
after
the
lads
left
their
home
the
road
lay
entirely
through
the
bush
it
was
a
path
they
had
often
travelled
both
alone
and
with
their
parents
and
they
felt
no
fear
there
had
been
a
slight
fall
of
snow
just
enough
to
cover
the
ground
and
the
day
was
clear
and
frosty
the
boys
in
this
country
always
hail
with
delight
the
first
fall
of
snow
and
they
ran
races
and
slid
over
all
the
shallow
pools
until
they
reached
george
desne
cabin
he
measured
young
brown
for
a
strong
pair
of
winter
boots
and
the
boys
returned
on
their
homeward
path
shouting
and
laughing
in
the
glee
of
their
hearts
about
they
suddenly
missed
their
companion
and
ran
back
nearly
a
mile
to
find
him
not
succeeding
they
thought
that
he
had
hidden
himself
behind
some
of
the
trees
and
in
order
to
frighten
them
was
pretending
to
be
lost
and
after
shouting
his
name
at
the
top
of
their
voices
and
receiving
no
answer
they
determined
to
defeat
his
trick
and
ran
home
without
him
they
knew
he
was
well
acquainted
with
the
road
that
it
was
still
broad
day
and
he
could
easily
find
his
way
home
alone
when
his
father
inquired
for
george
they
said
he
was
coming
and
went
to
their
respective
cabins
night
came
on
and
the
lad
did
not
return
and
his
parents
began
to
feel
alarmed
at
his
absence
brown
went
over
to
the
neighbouring
settlements
and
made
the
lads
repeat
to
him
all
they
knew
about
his
son
the
boys
described
the
part
of
the
road
where
they
first
missed
him
but
they
had
felt
no
uneasiness
about
him
for
they
concluded
that
he
had
either
run
home
before
them
or
had
gone
back
to
spend
the
night
with
the
young
desnes
who
had
been
very
importunate
for
him
to
stay
this
account
pacified
the
anxious
father
early
the
next
morning
he
went
to
desne
himself
to
bring
home
the
boy
but
to
his
astonishment
and
grief
he
had
not
been
there
his
mysterious
disappearance
gave
rise
to
a
thousand
strange
surmises
the
whole
settlement
turned
out
in
search
of
the
boy
his
steps
were
traced
off
the
road
a
few
yards
into
the
bush
and
entirely
disappeared
at
the
foot
of
a
large
oak
tree
the
tree
was
lofty
and
the
branches
so
far
from
the
ground
that
it
was
almost
impossible
for
any
boy
unassisted
to
have
raised
himself
to
such
a
height
there
was
no
track
of
any
animal
to
be
seen
on
the
new
fallen
snow
no
shred
of
garment
or
stain
of
blood
that
boy
fate
will
always
remain
a
great
mystery
for
he
was
never
found
he
must
have
been
carried
up
the
tree
by
a
bear
and
dragged
down
into
the
hollow
trunk
said
i
if
that
had
been
the
case
there
would
have
been
the
track
of
the
bear
feet
in
the
snow
it
does
not
however
follow
that
the
boy
is
dead
though
it
is
more
than
probable
i
knew
of
a
case
where
two
boys
and
a
girl
were
sent
into
the
woods
by
their
mother
to
fetch
home
the
cows
the
children
were
lost
the
parents
mourned
them
for
dead
for
all
search
after
them
proved
fruitless
at
length
after
seven
years
the
eldest
son
returned
the
children
had
been
overtaken
and
carried
off
by
a
party
of
indians
who
belonged
to
a
tribe
who
inhabited
the
islands
in
lake
huron
and
who
were
out
on
a
hunting
expedition
they
took
them
many
hundred
miles
away
from
their
forest
home
and
adopted
them
as
their
own
the
girl
when
she
grew
up
married
one
of
the
tribe
the
boys
followed
the
occupation
of
hunters
and
fishers
and
from
their
dress
and
appearance
might
have
passed
for
aborigines
of
the
forest
the
eldest
boy
however
never
forgot
his
own
name
or
the
manner
in
which
he
had
been
separated
from
his
parents
he
distinctly
remembered
the
township
and
the
natural
features
of
the
locality
and
took
the
first
opportunity
of
making
his
escape
and
travelling
back
to
the
home
of
his
childhood
when
he
made
himself
known
to
his
mother
who
was
a
widow
but
resided
on
the
same
spot
he
was
so
dark
and
that
she
could
not
believe
that
it
was
really
her
son
until
he
brought
back
to
her
mind
a
little
incident
that
forgotten
by
her
had
never
left
his
memory
do
you
remember
saying
to
me
on
that
afternoon
ned
you
need
not
look
for
the
cows
in
the
swamp
they
went
off
towards
the
big
hill
the
delighted
mother
immediately
caught
him
to
her
heart
exclaiming
say
truly
you
are
my
own
my
son
this
and
the
two
preceding
chapters
were
written
for
roughing
it
in
the
bush
and
were
sent
to
england
to
make
a
part
of
that
work
but
came
too
late
for
insertion
which
will
account
to
the
reader
for
their
appearance

the

in

rounded

of
the
city
and
which
is
thinly
covered
with
trees
the
land
lies
so
level
with
the
water
that
it
has
the
appearance
of
being
and
from
a
distance
you
only
see
the
tops
of
the
trees
i
have
been
informed
that
the
name
of
toronto
has
been
derived
from
this
circumstance
which
in
indian
literally
means
trees
in
the
water
if
the
island
rather
takes
from
than
adds
to
the
beauty
of
the
place
it
is
not
without
great
practical
advantages
as
to
it
the
city
is
mainly
indebted
for
its
sheltered
and
very
commodious
harbour
after
entering
the
harbour
toronto
presents
a
long
line
of
frontage
covered
with
handsome
buildings
to
the
eye
a
grey
mist
still
hovered
over
its
many
domes
and
spires
but
the
new
university
and
the
lunatic
asylum
stood
out
in
bold
relief
as
they
caught
the
broad
red
gleam
of
the
coming
day
it
was
my
first
visit
to
the
metropolitan
city
of
the
upper
province
and
with
no
small
degree
of
interest
i
examined
its
general
aspect
as
we
approached
the
wharf
it
does
not
present
such
an
imposing
appearance
from
the
water
as
kingston
but
it
strikes
you
instantly
as
a
place
of
far
greater
magnitude
and
importance
there
is
a
fresh
growing
healthy
vitality
about
this
place
that
can
not
fail
to
impress
a
stranger
very
forcibly
the
first
time
he
enters
it
he
feels
instinctively
that
he
sees
before
him
the
strong
throbbing
heart
of
this
gigantic
young
country
and
that
every
powerful
vibration
from
this
ever
increasing
centre
of
wealth
and
civilisation
infuses
life
and
vigour
through
the
whole
length
and
breadth
of
the
province
toronto
exceeded
the
most
sanguine
expectations
that
i
had
formed
of
it
at
a
distance
and
enabled
me
to
realize
distinctly
the
rising
greatness
and
rapid
improvement
of
the
colony
it
is
only
here
that
you
can
form
any
just
estimate
of
what
she
now
is
and
what
at
no
very
distant
period
she
must
be
the
country
for
some
miles
round
the
city
appears
to
the
eye
as
flat
as
a
floor
the
rise
though
very
gradual
is
i
am
told
considerable
and
the
land
is
sufficiently
elevated
above
the
lake
to
escape
the
disagreeable
character
of
being
low
and
swampy
anything
in
the
shape
of
a
slope
or
hill
is
not
distinguishable
in
the
present
area
on
which
toronto
is
built
but
the
streets
are
wide
and
clean
and
contain
many
handsome
public
buildings
and
the
beautiful
trees
which
everywhere
abound
in
the
neat
gardens
that
surround
the
dwellings
of
the
wealthier
inhabitants
with
the
broad
bright
blue
inland
sea
that
forms
the
foreground
to
the
picture
give
to
it
such
a
lively
and
agreeable
character
that
it
takes
from
it
all
appearance
of
tameness
and
monotony
the
wharfs
with
which
our
first
practical
acquaintance
with
the
city
commenced
are
very
narrow
and
incommodious
they
are
built
on
piles
of
wood
running
out
to
some
distance
in
the
water
and
covered
with
rotten
boards
as
far
as
comfort
and
convenience
go
they
are
far
inferior
to
those
of
cobourg
and
kingston
or
even
to
those
of
our
own
dear
little
city
of
the
bay
as
belleville
has
not
inaptly
been
christened
by
the
strange
madcap
calling
himself
the
great
orator
of
the
west
it
is
devoutly
to
be
hoped
that
a
few
years
will
sweep
all
these
decayed
old
wharfs
into
the
ontario
and
that
more
substantial
ones
built
of
stone
will
be
erected
in
their
place
rome
however
was
not
built
in
a
day
and
the
magic
growth
of
this
city
of
the
west
is
almost
as
miraculous
as
that
of
jonah
celebrated
gourd
the
steamboat
had
scarcely
been
secured
to
her
wharf
before
we
were
surrounded
by
a
host
of
cabmen
who
rushed
on
board
fighting
and
squabbling
with
each
other
in
order
to
secure
the
first
chance
of
passengers
and
their
luggage
the
hubbub
in
front
of
the
ladies
cabin
grew
to
a
perfect
uproar
and
as
most
of
the
gentlemen
were
still
in
the
arms
of
morpheus
these
noisy
mercuries
had
it
all
their
own
way
swearing
and
shouting
at
the
top
of
their
voices
in
a
manner
that
rivalled
civilized
europe
i
was
perfectly
astonished
at
their
volubility
and
the
pertinacity
of
their
attentions
which
were
poured
forth
in
the
true
milesian
fashion
an
odd
mixture
of
blarney
and
audacity
at
kingston
these
gentry
are
far
more
civil
and
less
importunate
and
we
witnessed
none
of
this
disgraceful
annoyance
at
any
other
port
on
the
lake
one
of
these
paddies
in
his
hurry
to
secure
the
persons
and
luggage
of
several
ladies
who
had
been
my
in
the
cabin
nearly
backed
his
crazy
old
vehicle
over
the
unguarded
wooden
wharf
into
the
lake
we
got
safely
stowed
at
last
into
one
of
these
machines
which
internally
are
not
destitute
of
either
comfort
or
convenience
and
driving
through
some
of
the
principal
avenues
of
the
city
were
safely
deposited
at
the
door
of
a
dear
friend
who
had
come
on
board
to
conduct
us
to
his
hospitable
home
and
here
i
found
the
rest
and
quiet
so
much
needed
by
an
invalid
after
a
long
and
fatiguing
journey
it
was
some
days
before
i
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
visit
any
of
the
lions
of
the
place
with
a
minute
description
of
these
i
shall
not
trouble
my
readers
my
book
is
written
more
with
a
view
to
convey
general
impressions
than
to
delineate
separate
features
to
while
away
the
languid
heat
of
a
summer
day
or
the
dreary
dulness
of
a
wet
one
the
intending
emigrant
who
is
anxious
for
commercial
calculations
and
statistical
details
will
find
all
that
he
can
require
on
this
head
in
scobie
almanack
and
smith
past
present
and
future
of
canada
works
written
expressly
for
that
purpose
women
make
good
use
of
their
eyes
and
ears
and
paint
scenes
that
amuse
or
strike
their
fancy
with
tolerable
accuracy
but
it
requires
the
heart
of
man
to
anticipate
events
and
trace
certain
results
from
particular
causes
women
are
out
of
their
element
when
they
attempt
to
speculate
upon
these
abstruse
matters
are
apt
to
incline
too
strongly
to
their
own
opinions
and
jump
at
conclusions
which
are
either
false
or
unsatisfactory
my
first
visit
was
to
which
may
be
considered
as
the
of
toronto
it
is
the
great
central
avenue
of
commerce
and
contains
many
fine
buildings
and
handsome
capacious
stores
while
a
number
of
new
ones
are
in
a
state
of
progress
this
fine
broad
airy
thoroughfare
would
be
an
ornament
to
any
town
or
city
and
the
bustle
and
traffic
through
it
give
to
strangers
a
tolerably
just
idea
of
the
wealth
and
industry
of
the
community
all
the
streets
terminate
at
the
water
edge
but
which
runs
parallel
with
it
and
may
be
termed
the
west
end
of
toronto
for
most
of
the
wealthy
residents
have
handsome
houses
and
gardens
in
this
street
which
is
open
through
the
whole
length
of
it
to
the
lake
the
is
upon
the
edge
of
the
water
along
this
natural
terrace
the
situation
is
uncommonly
lively
as
it
commands
a
fine
view
of
the
harbour
and
vessels
and
steamboats
are
passing
to
and
fro
continually
the
lawrence
market
which
is
near
the
bottom
of
is
a
handsome
commodious
building
and
capitally
supplied
with
all
the
fish
flesh
and
fowl
besides
abundance
of
excellent
fruits
and
vegetables
which
can
be
procured
at
very
reasonable
prices
the
is
over
the
and
i
am
told
for
i
did
not
visit
it
that
it
is
a
noble
room
capable
of
accommodating
a
large
number
of
people
with
ease
and
comfort
toronto
is
very
rich
in
handsome
churches
which
form
one
of
its
chief
attractions
i
was
greatly
struck
with
the
elegant
spire
of
church
which
is
perhaps
the
most
graceful
in
the
city
the
body
of
the
church
however
seems
rather
too
short
and
out
of
proportion
for
the
tall
slender
tower
which
would
have
appeared
to
much
greater
advantage
attached
to
a
building
double
the
length
nothing
attracted
my
attention
or
interested
me
more
than
the
handsome
book
stores
those
of
armour
scobie
and
maclean
are
equal
to
many
in
london
in
appearance
and
far
superior
to
those
that
were
to
be
found
in
norwich
and
ipswich
thirty
years
ago
this
speaks
well
for
the
mental
improvement
of
canada
and
is
a
proof
that
people
have
more
leisure
for
acquiring
book
lore
and
more
money
for
the
purchase
of
books
than
they
had
some
years
ago
the
piracies
of
the
americans
have
realized
the
old
proverb
that
is
an
ill
wind
that
blows
nobody
any
good
incalculable
are
the
benefits
that
canada
derives
from
her
cheap
reprints
of
all
the
european
standard
works
which
on
good
paper
and
in
handsome
bindings
can
be
bought
at
a
quarter
the
price
of
the
english
editions
this
circumstance
must
always
make
the
canadas
a
bad
market
for
english
publications
most
of
these
it
is
true
can
be
procured
by
wealthy
individuals
at
the
book
stores
mentioned
above
but
the
american
reprints
of
the
same
works
abound
a
novels
form
the
most
attractive
species
of
reading
here
for
the
young
and
the
best
of
these
in
pamphlet
form
may
be
procured
for
from
to
fifty
cents
and
here
i
must
claim
the
privilege
of
speaking
a
few
words
in
defence
of
both
novel
readers
and
novel
writers
in
spite
of
the
horror
which
i
fancy
i
see
depicted
on
many
a
grave
countenance
there
are
many
good
and
conscientious
persons
who
regard
novels
and
novel
writers
with
devout
horror
who
condemn
their
works
however
moral
in
their
tendency
as
unfit
for
the
perusal
of
responsible
and
intelligent
creatures
who
will
not
admit
into
their
libraries
any
books
but
such
as
treat
of
religious
historical
or
scientific
subjects
imagining
and
we
think
very
erroneously
that
all
works
of
fiction
have
a
demoralizing
effect
and
tend
to
weaken
the
judgment
and
enervate
the
mind
we
will
however
allow
that
there
is
both
truth
and
sound
sense
in
some
of
these
objections
that
if
a
young
person
reading
is
entirely
confined
to
this
class
of
literature
and
that
of
an
inferior
sort
a
great
deal
of
harm
may
be
the
result
as
many
of
these
works
are
apt
to
convey
to
them
false
and
exaggerated
pictures
of
life
such
a
course
of
reading
would
produce
the
same
effect
upon
the
mind
as
a
constant
diet
of
sweetmeats
would
upon
the
stomach
it
would
destroy
the
digestion
and
induce
a
loathing
for
more
wholesome
food
still
the
mind
requires
recreation
as
well
as
the
body
and
can
not
always
be
engaged
upon
serious
studies
without
injury
to
the
brain
and
the
disarrangement
of
some
of
the
most
important
organs
of
the
body
now
we
think
it
could
be
satisfactorily
proved
in
spite
of
the
stern
crusade
perpetually
waged
against
works
of
fiction
by
a
large
portion
of
people
that
much
good
has
been
done
in
the
world
through
their
instrumentality
most
novels
and
romances
particularly
those
of
the
modern
school
are
founded
upon
real
incidents
and
like
the
best
heads
in
the
picture
the
characters
are
drawn
from
life
and
the
closer
the
drawing
or
story
approximates
to
nature
the
more
interesting
and
popular
will
it
become
though
a
vast
number
of
these
works
are
daily
pouring
from
the
british
and
american
press
it
is
only
those
of
a
very
high
class
that
are
generally
read
and
become
as
familiar
as
household
words
the
tastes
of
individuals
differ
widely
on
articles
of
dress
food
and
amusement
but
there
is
a
wonderful
affinity
in
the
minds
of
men
as
regards
works
of
literature
a
book
that
appeals
strongly
to
the
passions
if
true
to
nature
will
strike
nearly
all
alike
and
obtain
a
popularity
while
the
mere
fiction
sinks
back
into
obscurity
is
once
read
and
forgotten
the
works
of
smollett
and
fielding
were
admirable
pictures
of
society
as
it
existed
in
their
day
but
we
live
in
a
more
refined
age
and
few
young
people
would
feel
any
pleasure
in
the
coarse
pictures
exhibited
in
those
once
celebrated
works
the
novels
of
richardson
recommended
by
grave
divines
from
the
pulpit
as
perfect
models
of
purity
and
virtue
would
now
be
cast
aside
with
indifference
and
disgust
they
were
considered
quite
the
reverse
in
the
age
he
wrote
and
he
was
regarded
as
one
of
the
great
reformers
of
the
vices
of
his
time
we
may
therefore
conclude
that
although
repugnant
to
our
taste
and
feelings
they
were
the
means
of
effecting
much
good
in
a
gross
and
licentious
age
in
the
writings
of
our
great
modern
novelists
virtue
is
never
debased
nor
vice
exalted
but
there
is
a
constant
endeavour
to
impress
upon
the
mind
of
the
reader
the
true
wisdom
of
the
one
and
the
folly
of
the
other
and
where
the
author
fails
to
create
an
interest
in
the
fate
of
his
hero
or
heroine
it
is
not
because
they
are
bad
or
immoral
characters
like
lovelace
in
clarissa
harlowe
and
lord
b
in
pamela
but
that
like
sir
charles
grandison
they
are
too
good
for
reality
and
their
very
faultlessness
renders
them
like
the
said
sir
charles
affected
and
unnatural
where
high
moral
excellence
is
represented
as
struggling
with
the
faults
and
follies
common
to
humanity
sometimes
yielding
to
temptation
and
reaping
the
bitter
fruits
and
at
other
times
successfully
resisting
the
allurements
of
vice
all
our
sympathies
are
engaged
in
the
contest
it
becomes
our
own
and
we
follow
the
hero
through
all
his
trials
weep
over
his
fall
or
triumph
in
his
success
children
who
possess
an
unsophisticated
judgment
in
these
matters
seldom
feel
much
interest
in
the
model
boy
of
a
moral
story
not
from
any
innate
depravity
of
mind
which
leads
them
to
prefer
vice
to
virtue
for
no
such
preference
can
exist
in
the
human
breast
no
not
even
in
the
perverted
hearts
of
the
worst
of
men
but
because
the
model
boy
is
like
no
other
boy
of
their
acquaintance
he
does
not
resemble
them
for
he
is
a
piece
of
unnatural
perfection
he
neither
fights
nor
cries
nor
wishes
to
play
when
he
ought
to
be
busy
with
his
lessons
he
lectures
like
a
parson
and
talks
like
a
book
his
face
is
never
dirty
he
never
tears
his
clothes
nor
soils
his
hands
with
making
dirt
pies
or
puddling
in
the
mud
his
hair
is
always
smooth
his
face
always
wears
a
smile
and
he
was
never
known
to
sulk
or
say
wo
the
boy
is
a
perfect
stranger
they
ca
recognise
his
likeness
or
follow
his
example
and
why
because
both
are
unnatural
caricatures
but
be
sure
that
if
the
naughty
boy
of
the
said
tale
creates
the
most
interest
for
his
fate
in
the
mind
of
the
youthful
reader
it
is
simply
because
he
is
drawn
with
more
truthfulness
than
the
character
that
was
intended
for
his
counterpart
the
language
of
passion
is
always
eloquent
and
the
bad
boy
is
delineated
true
to
his
bad
nature
and
is
made
to
speak
and
act
naturally
which
never
fails
to
awaken
a
touch
of
sympathy
in
beings
equally
prone
to
err
i
again
repeat
that
few
minds
if
any
exist
than
can
find
beauty
in
deformity
or
aught
to
admire
in
the
hideousness
of
vice
there
are
many
persons
in
the
world
who
can
not
bear
to
receive
instruction
when
conveyed
to
them
in
a
serious
form
who
shrink
with
loathing
from
the
cant
with
which
too
many
religious
novels
are
loaded
and
who
yet
might
be
induced
to
listen
to
precepts
of
religion
and
morality
when
arrayed
in
a
more
amusing
and
attractive
garb
and
enforced
by
characters
who
speak
and
feel
like
themselves
and
share
in
all
things
a
common
humanity
some
of
our
admirable
modern
works
of
fiction
or
rather
truths
disguised
in
order
to
make
them
more
palatable
to
the
generality
of
readers
have
done
more
to
ameliorate
the
sorrows
of
mankind
by
drawing
the
attention
of
the
public
to
the
wants
and
woes
of
the
lower
classes
than
all
the
charity
sermons
that
have
been
delivered
from
the
pulpit
yes
the
despised
and
reprobated
novelist
by
daring
to
unveil
the
crimes
and
miseries
of
neglected
and
ignorant
men
and
to
point
out
the
abuses
which
have
produced
and
are
still
producing
the
same
dreadful
results
are
missionaries
in
the
cause
of
humanity
the
real
friends
and
benefactors
of
mankind
the
selfish
worldling
may
denounce
as
infamous
and
immoral
the
pictures
of
human
suffering
and
degradation
that
the
writings
of
dickens
and
sue
have
presented
to
their
gaze
and
declare
that
they
are
unfit
to
meet
the
eyes
of
the
virtuous
and
refined
that
no
good
can
arise
from
the
publication
of
such
revolting
details
and
that
to
be
ignorant
of
the
existence
of
such
horrors
is
in
itself
a
species
of
virtue
daughter
of
wealth
daintily
nurtured
and
nicely
educated
blindness
nature
does
your
superiority
over
these
fallen
creatures
spring
from
any
innate
principle
in
your
own
breast
which
renders
you
more
worthy
of
the
admiration
and
esteem
of
your
are
not
you
indebted
to
the
circumstances
in
which
you
are
placed
and
to
that
moral
education
for
every
virtue
that
you
possess
you
can
feel
no
pity
for
the
murderer
the
thief
the
prostitute
such
people
may
aptly
be
termed
the
wild
beasts
of
society
and
like
wild
beasts
should
be
hunted
down
and
killed
in
order
to
secure
the
peace
and
comfort
of
the
rest
well
the
law
has
been
doing
this
for
many
ages
and
yet
the
wild
beasts
still
exist
and
prey
upon
their
neighbours
and
such
will
still
continue
to
be
the
case
until
christianity
following
the
example
of
her
blessed
founder
goes
forth
into
the
wilderness
of
life
on
her
errand
of
mercy
not
to
condemn
but
to
seek
and
to
save
that
which
is
lost
the
conventional
rules
of
society
have
formed
a
hedge
about
you
which
renders
any
flagrant
breach
of
morality
very
difficult
in
some
cases
almost
impossible
from
infancy
the
dread
commandments
have
been
sounding
in
your
ears
thou
shalt
not
kill
thou
shalt
not
steal
thou
shalt
not
commit
adultery
and
the
awful
mandate
has
been
strengthened
by
the
admonitions
of
pious
parents
and
good
ministers
all
anxious
for
your
eternal
welfare
you
may
well
be
honest
for
all
your
wants
have
been
supplied
and
you
have
yet
to
learn
that
where
no
temptation
exists
virtue
itself
becomes
a
negative
quality
you
do
not
covet
the
goods
which
others
possess
you
have
never
looked
down
with
confusion
of
face
and
heartfelt
bitterness
on
the
dirty
rags
that
scarcely
suffice
to
conceal
the
emaciation
of
your
wasted
limbs
you
have
never
felt
hunger
gnawing
at
your
vitals
or
shuddered
at
the
cries
of
famishing
children
sobbing
around
your
knees
for
bread
you
have
dainties
to
satiety
every
day
and
know
nothing
of
the
agonies
of
sacrificing
your
virtue
for
the
sake
of
a
meal
if
you
are
cold
you
have
a
good
fire
to
warm
you
a
comfortable
mansion
to
protect
you
from
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
and
garments
suitable
to
every
season
of
the
year
how
can
you
be
expected
to
sympathize
with
the
ragged
houseless
children
of
want
and
infamy
you
can
not
bear
to
have
these
sad
realities
presented
to
your
notice
it
shocks
your
nerves
you
can
not
bring
yourself
to
admit
that
these
outcasts
of
society
are
composed
of
the
same
clay
and
you
blame
the
authors
who
have
dared
to
run
a
tilt
against
your
prejudices
and
have
not
only
attested
the
unwelcome
fact
but
have
pointed
out
the
causes
which
lead
to
the
hopeless
degradation
and
depravity
of
these
miserable
you
can
not
read
the
works
of
these
humane
men
because
they
bid
you
to
step
with
them
into
these
dirty
abodes
of
guilt
and
wretchedness
and
see
what
crime
really
is
and
all
the
horrors
that
ignorance
and
poverty
and
a
want
of
never
fail
to
bring
about
you
can
not
enter
into
these
abodes
of
your
neglected
and
starving
brothers
and
sisters
these
forlorn
scions
of
a
common
stock
and
view
their
cold
hearths
and
unfurnished
tables
their
beds
of
straw
and
tattered
garments
without
defilement
or
witness
their
days
of
unremitting
toil
and
nights
of
unrest
and
worse
far
worse
to
behold
the
evil
passions
and
crimes
which
spring
from
a
state
of
ignorance
producing
a
moral
darkness
that
can
be
felt
you
are
insulted
and
offended
at
being
seen
in
such
bad
company
and
can
not
for
a
moment
imagine
that
a
change
in
your
relative
positions
might
have
rendered
you
no
wiser
or
better
than
them
but
let
me
ask
you
candidly
has
not
the
terrible
scene
produced
some
effect
can
you
forget
its
existence
its
shocking
reality
the
lesson
it
teaches
may
be
distasteful
but
you
can
not
shake
off
a
knowledge
of
its
melancholy
facts
the
voice
of
conscience
speaks
audibly
to
your
heart
that
still
small
voice
that
awful
record
of
himself
that
god
has
placed
in
every
breast
and
woe
be
to
you
or
any
one
when
it
ceases
to
be
heard
tells
you
that
you
can
not
without
violating
the
divine
mandate
love
thy
neighbour
as
thyself
leave
these
miserable
creatures
to
languish
and
die
without
making
one
effort
to
aid
in
rescuing
them
from
their
melancholy
fate
but
what
can
i
do
i
hear
you
indignantly
exclaim
much
oh
how
much
you
have
wealth
a
small
part
of
which
can
not
be
better
bestowed
than
in
educating
these
poor
creatures
in
teaching
them
to
recognise
those
divine
laws
which
they
have
broken
in
leading
them
step
by
step
into
those
paths
of
piety
and
peace
they
have
never
known
ignorance
has
been
the
most
powerful
agent
in
corrupting
these
perishing
criminals
give
them
healthful
employment
the
means
of
emigrating
to
countries
where
labour
is
amply
remunerated
and
will
secure
for
them
comfort
independence
and
in
canada
these
victims
of
prove
beneficial
members
of
society
while
with
you
they
are
regarded
as
a
blight
and
a
curse
numbers
of
this
class
are
yearly
cast
upon
these
shores
yet
the
crimes
which
are
commonly
committed
by
their
instrumentality
in
britain
very
rarely
occur
with
us
we
could
not
sleep
with
unfastened
doors
and
windows
near
populous
towns
if
the
change
in
their
condition
did
not
bring
about
a
greater
moral
change
in
the
character
of
these
poor
emigrants
they
readily
gain
employment
their
toils
are
amply
remunerated
and
they
cease
to
commit
crime
to
procure
a
precarious
existence
in
the
very
worst
of
these
people
some
good
exists
a
few
seeds
remain
of
divine
planting
which
if
fostered
and
judiciously
trained
might
yet
bear
fruit
for
heaven
the
authors
whose
works
you
call
disgusting
and
immoral
point
out
this
and
afford
you
the
most
pathetic
illustrations
of
its
truth
you
need
not
fear
contamination
from
the
vices
which
they
portray
their
depravity
is
of
too
black
a
hue
to
have
the
least
attraction
even
to
beings
only
removed
a
few
degrees
from
the
same
guilt
vice
may
have
her
admirers
when
she
glitters
in
gold
and
scarlet
but
when
exposed
in
filth
and
nakedness
her
most
reckless
devotees
shrink
back
from
her
in
disgust
and
horror
vice
without
her
mask
is
a
spectacle
too
appalling
for
humanity
it
exhibits
the
hideousness
and
breathes
of
the
corruption
of
hell
if
these
reprobated
works
of
fiction
can
startle
the
rich
into
a
painful
consciousness
of
the
wants
and
agonies
of
the
poor
and
make
them
in
spite
of
all
the
conventional
laws
of
society
acknowledge
their
kindred
humanity
who
shall
say
that
their
books
have
been
written
in
vain
for
my
own
part
i
look
upon
these
authors
as
teachers
who
have
been
commissioned
by
the
great
father
of
souls
to
proclaim
to
the
world
the
wrongs
and
sufferings
of
millions
of
his
creatures
to
plead
their
cause
with
unflinching
integrity
and
with
almost
superhuman
eloquence
demand
for
them
the
justice
which
the
world
has
so
long
denied
these
men
are
the
benefactors
of
their
species
to
whom
the
whole
human
race
owe
a
vast
debt
of
gratitude
since
the
publication
of
oliver
twist
and
many
other
works
of
the
same
class
inquiries
have
been
made
by
thinking
and
benevolent
individuals
into
the
condition
of
the
destitute
poor
in
great
cities
and
manufacturing
districts
these
works
brought
to
light
deeds
of
darkness
and
scenes
of
oppression
and
cruelty
scarcely
to
be
credited
in
modern
times
and
in
christian
communities
the
attention
of
the
public
was
directed
towards
this
miserable
class
of
beings
and
its
best
sympathies
enlisted
in
their
behalf
it
was
called
upon
to
assist
in
the
liberation
of
these
white
slaves
chained
to
the
oar
for
life
in
the
galleys
of
wealth
and
to
recognize
them
as
men
and
brethren
then
sprang
up
the
ragged
schools
the
institutions
for
reclaiming
the
youthful
vagrants
of
london
and
teaching
the
idle
and
profligate
the
sublime
morality
of
sobriety
and
industry
persons
who
were
unable
to
contribute
money
to
these
truly
noble
objects
of
charity
were
ready
to
assist
in
the
capacity
of
teachers
and
add
their
mite
in
the
great
work
of
moral
reform
in
countries
like
england
and
france
the
evils
arising
out
of
extreme
poverty
could
not
be
easily
remedied
yet
the
help
thus
afforded
by
the
rich
contributed
greatly
in
ameliorating
the
distress
of
thousands
of
the
poorer
classes
to
the
same
source
we
may
trace
the
mitigation
of
many
severe
laws
the
punishment
of
death
is
no
longer
enforced

in
cases
of
great
depravity

stepped
in

wiped

hood
song

an
almost
electric
effect
upon
the
public
mind
it
was
a
bold
truthful
appeal
to
the
best
feelings
of
humanity
and
it
found
a
response
in
every
feeling
heart
it
laid
bare
the
distress
of
a
most
deserving
and
oppressed
portion
of
the

the
good
it
did

at

vanished

what
matters
it
to
thee
if
the

generations
it

its

lunatic
asylum
alas
poor
maniac
for
thee
no
hope
can
dawn
no
tender
tie
wake
in
thy
blighted
heart
a
thrill
of
joy
the
immortal
mind
is
levelled
with
the
dust
ere
the
tenacious
chords
of
life
give
way
our
next
visit
was
to
the
lunatic
asylum
the
building
is
of
white
brick
a
material
not
very
common
in
canada
but
used
largely
in
toronto
where
stone
has
to
be
brought
from
a
considerable
distance
there
being
no
quarries
in
the
neighbourhood
brick
has
not
the
substantial
august
appearance
that
stone
gives
to
a
large
building
and
it
is
more
liable
to
injury
from
the
severe
frosts
of
winter
in
this
climate
the
asylum
is
a
spacious
edifice
surrounded
by
extensive
grounds
for
the
cultivation
of
fruits
and
vegetables
these
are
principally
worked
by
the
male
patients
who
are
in
a
state
of
convalescence
while
it
affords
them
ample
room
for
air
and
exercise
a
large
gang
of
these
unfortunates
were
taking
their
daily
promenade
when
our
cab
stopped
at
the
entrance
gate
they
gazed
upon
us
with
an
eager
air
of
childish
curiosity
as
we
alighted
from
our
conveyance
and
entered
the
building
we
were
received
very
politely
by
one
of
the
gentlemen
belonging
to
the
establishment
who
proceeded
to
show
us
over
the
place
ascending
a
broad
flight
of
steps
as
clean
as
it
was
possible
for
human
hands
to
make
them
we
came
to
a
long
wide
gallery
separated
at
either
end
by
large
the
upper
part
of
which
were
of
glass
those
to
the
right
opening
into
the
ward
set
apart
for
male
patients
who
were
so
far
harmless
that
they
were
allowed
the
free
use
of
their
limbs
and
could
be
spoken
to
without
any
danger
to
the
visitors
the
female
lunatics
inhabited
the
ward
to
the
left
and
to
these
we
first
directed
our
attention
the
long
hall
into
which
their
and
sleeping
apartments
opened
was
lofty
well
lighted
well
aired
and
exquisitely
clean
so
were
the
persons
of
the
women
who
were
walking
to
and
fro
laughing
and
chatting
very
sociably
together
others
were
sewing
and
quilting
in
rooms
set
apart
for
that
purpose
there
was
no
appearance
of
wretchedness
or
misery
in
this
ward
nothing
that
associated
with
it
the
terrible
idea
of
madness
i
had
been
wont
to
entertain
for
these
poor
creatures
looked
healthy
and
cheerful
nay
almost
happy
as
if
they
had
given
the
world
and
all
its
cares
the
there
was
one
thin
eccentric
looking
woman
in
middle
life
who
came
forward
to
receive
us
with
an
air
of
great
dignity
she
gave
us
her
hand
in
a
most
condescending
manner
and
smiled
most
graciously
when
the
gentleman
who
was
with
us
inquired
after
her
health
she
fancies
herself
victoria
and
in
order
to
humour
her
conceit
she
is
allowed
to
wear
a
cap
of
many
colours
with
tinsel
ornaments

person
who
is
from
the
lowest
class
certainly
enjoys
her
imaginary
dignity
in
a
much
greater
degree
than
any
crowned
monarch
and
is
perhaps
far
prouder
of
her
fool
cap
than
our
gracious
sovereign
is
of
her
imperial
diadem
the
madwomen
round
her
appeared
to
consider
her
assumption
of
royalty
as
a
very
good
joke
for
the
homage
they
rendered
her
was
quizzical
in
the
extreme
there
are
times
when
these
people
seem
to
have
a
vague
consciousness
of
their
situation
when
gleams
of
sense
break
in
upon
them
and
whisper
the
awful
truth
to
their
minds
such
moments
must
form
the
drops
of
bitterness
in
the
poisoned
cup
of
life
which
a
mysterious
providence
has
presented
to
their
lips
while
i
was
looking
sadly
from
face
to
face
as
these
benighted
creatures
flitted
round
me
a
tall
stout
woman
exclaimed
in
a
loud
voice
that
m
of
belleville
god
bless
her
many
a
good
quarter
dollar
i
got
from
her
and
running
up
to
me
she
flung
her
arms
about
my
neck
and
kissed
me
most
vehemently
i
did
not
at
first
recognise
her
and
though
i
submitted
with
a
good
grace
to
the
mad
hug
she
gave
me
i
am
afraid
that
i
trembled
not
a
little
in
her
grasp
she
was
the
wife
of
a
cooper
who
lived
opposite
to
us
during
the
first
two
years
we
resided
in
belleville
and
i
used
to
buy
from
her
all
the
milk
i
needed
for
the
children
she
was
always
a
strange
eccentric
creature
when
sane
if
indeed
she
ever
had
enjoyed
the
right
use
of
her
senses
and
in
spite
of
the
joy
she
manifested
at
the
unexpected
sight
of
me
i
remember
her
once
threatening
to
break
my
head
with
an
old
hoop
when
i
endeavoured
to
save
her
little
girl
from
a
frightful
flagellation
from
the
same
instrument
i
had
stepped
across
the
street
to
her
husband
workshop
to
order
a
new
meat
barrel
i
found
him
putting
a
barrel
together
assisted
by
a
fine
little
girl
of
ten
years
of
age
who
embraced
the
staves
with
her
thin
supple
arms
while
the
father
slipped
one
of
the
hoops
over
them
in
order
to
secure
them
in
their
place
it
was
a
pretty
picture
the
smiling
rosy
face
of
the
girl
looking
down
upon
her
father
as
he
stooped
over
the
barrel
adjusting
the
hoop
his
white
curling
hair
falling
over
her
slender
arms
just
then
the
door
was
flung
open
and
rushed
in
like
a
fury
katrine
where
are
you
here
mother
said
the
child
very
quietly
how
dar
you
to
leave
the
cradle
widout
my
lave
father
called
me
and
the
child
turned
pale
and
began
to
tremble
i
came
for
a
moment
to
help
him
you
little
wretch
cried
the
unjust
woman
seizing
the
child
by
the
arm
i
teach
you
to
mind
him
more
nor
you
mind
me
take
that
and
here
followed
an
awful
oath
and
such
a
blow
upon
the
bare
neck
of
the
unhappy
child
that
she
left
her
hold
of
the
barrel
and
fairly
shrieked
with
pain
let
the
girl
alone
mary
it
was
my
fault
said
the
husband
yes
it
always
is
your
fault
but
she
shall
pay
for
it
and
taking
up
a
broken
hoop
she
began
to
beat
the
child
furiously
my
woman
heart
could
stand
it
no
longer
i
ran
forward
and
threw
my
arms
round
the
child
get
out
wid
you
she
cried
what
business
is
it
of
yours
i
break
your
head
if
you
are
not
off
out
of
this
i
not
afraid
of
you
but
i
would
not
see
you
use
a
dog
in
that
manner
much
less
a
child
who
has
done
nothing
to
deserve
such
treatment
curse
you
all
said
the
human
fiend
flinging
down
her
ugly
weapon
and
scowling
upon
us
with
her
gloomy
eyes
i
wish
you
were
all
in
a
place
far
too
warm
for
this
hot
season
of
the
year
i
thought
as
i
walked
sorrowfully
home
bad
as
i
then
considered
her
i
have
now
no
doubt
that
it
was
the
incipient
workings
of
her
direful
malady
which
certainly
comes
nearest
to
any
idea
we
can
form
of
demoniacal
possession
she
is
at
present
an
incurable
but
harmless
maniac
and
in
spite
of
the
instance
of
cruelty
that
i
have
just
related
towards
her
little
girl
now
during
the
dark
period
of
her
mind
eclipse
gleams
of
maternal
love
struggled
like
glimpses
of
sunshine
through
a
stormy
cloud
and
she
inquired
of
me
earnestly
pathetically
nay
even
tenderly
for
her
children
alas
poor
maniac
how
could
i
tell
her
that
the
girl
she
had
chastised
so
undeservedly
had
died
in
early
womanhood
and
her
son
a
fine
young
man
of
twenty
had
committed
suicide
and
flung
himself
off
the
bridge
into
the
moira
river
only
a
few
months
before
her
insanity
saved
her
from
the
knowledge
of
events
which
might
have
distracted
a
firmer
brain
she
seemed
hardly
satisfied
with
my
evasive
answers
and
looked
doubtingly
and
cunningly
at
me
as
if
some
demon
had
whispered
to
her
the
awful
truth
it
was
singular
that
this
woman
should
recognise
me
after
so
many
years
altered
as
my
appearance
was
by
time
and
sickness
my
dearest
friends
would
hardly
have
known
me
yet
she
knew
me
at
a
single
glance
what
was
still
more
extraordinary
she
remembered
my
daughter
now
a
wife
and
mother
whom
she
had
not
seen
since
she
was
a
little
girl
what
a
wonderful
faculty
is
memory
the
most
mysterious
and
inexplicable
in
the
great
riddle
of
life
that
plastic
tablet
on
which
the
almighty
registers
with
unerring
fidelity
the
records
of
being
making
it
the
depository
of
all
our
words
thoughts
and
deeds
this
faithful
witness
against
us
for
good
or
evil
at
the
great
assize
that
hereafter
must
determine
our
eternal
fate
when
conscience
at
his
dread
command
shall
open
up
this
book
of
life
keep
thy
heart
my
son
for
out
of
it
are
the
issues
of
life
be
sure
that
memory
guards
well
that
secret
treasure
all
that
the
heart
ever
felt
the
mind
ever
thought
the
restless
spirit
ever
willed
is
there
another
woman
wild
dark
and
with
her
hands
in
mufflers
flitted
after
us
from
room
to
room
her
black
flashing
eyes
fixed
intently
on
my
daughter
yes
it
is
my
own
mary
but
she
speak
to
me
the
gentleman
in
attendance
begged
us
to
take
no
notice
of
this
person
as
she
was
apt
to
be
very
violent
another
stout
matron
with
good
features
and
a
very
pleasant
face
insisted
on
shaking
hands
with
us
all
round
judging
from
her
round
sonsy
rosy
face
you
never
could
have
imagined
her
to
have
been
mad
when
we
spoke
in
admiration
of
the
extreme
neatness
and
cleanness
of
the
large
sleeping
apartment
she
said
very
quietly
ah
you
would
not
wonder
at
that
could
you
see
all
the
at
night
cleaning
it
then
she
turned
to
me
and
whispered
very
confidentially
in
my
ear
are
you
mad
you
see
these
people
they
are
all
mad
as
mad
as
march
hares
do
come
here
if
you
can
help
it
all
very
well
at
first
and
it
looks
very
clean
and
comfortable
but
when
the
doors
are
once
shut
you
ca
get
out
no
not
if
you
ask
it
upon
your
knees
she
then
retreated
nodding
significantly
leaving
this
ward
we
visited
the
one
which
contained
the
male
lunatics
they
appeared
far
more
gloomy
and
reserved
than
the
women
we
had
left
one
young
man
who
used
to
travel
the
country
with
jewellery
and
who
had
often
been
at
our
house
recognised
us
in
a
moment
but
he
did
not
come
forward
like
to
greet
us
but
ran
into
a
corner
and
turning
to
the
wall
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
until
we
had
passed
on
here
was
at
least
a
consciousness
of
his
unfortunate
situation
that
was
very
painful
to
witness
a
gentlemanly
man
in
the
prime
of
life
who
had
once
practised
the
law
in
toronto
and
was
a
person
of
some
consequence
still
retained
the
dress
and
manners
belonging
to
his
class
he
had
gone
to
the
same
school
with
my
and
he
greeted
him
in
the
most
hearty
and
affectionate
manner
throwing
his
arm
about
his
shoulder
and
talking
of
his
affairs
in
the
most
confidential
manner
his
mental
aberration
was
only
displayed
in
a
few
harmless
remarks
such
as
telling
us
that
this
large
house
was
his
that
it
had
been
built
with
his
money
and
that
it
was
very
hard
he
was
kept
a
prisoner
in
his
own
dwelling
that
he
was
worth
millions
and
that
people
were
trying
to
cheat
him
of
all
his
money
but
that
if
once
he
could
get
out
he
would
punish
them
all
he
then
directed
my
to
bring
up
some
law
books
that
he
named
on
the
morrow
and
he
would
give
him
a
dozen
suits
against
the
parties
from
whom
he
had
received
so
many
injuries
in
the
balcony
at
the
far
end
of
the
gallery
we
found
a
group
of
men
walking
to
and
fro
for
the
sake
of
air
or
lounging
listlessly
on
benches
gazing
with
vacant
eyes
upon
the
fine
prospect
of
wood
and
water
dressed
in
the
gorgeous
hues
of
an
autumnal
sunset
one
very
man
with
a
magnificent
head
was
busy
writing
upon
a
dirty
piece
of
paper
with
a
pencil
his
table
furnished
by
his
knee
and
his
desk
the
cover
of
his
closed
but
well
worn
bible
he
rose
as
we
drew
near
him
and
bowing
politely
gave
us
a
couple
of
poems
which
he
drew
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
these
were
written
some
time
ago
he
said
one
of
them
is
much
better
than
the
other
there
are
some
fine
lines
in
that
ode
to
niagara
i
composed
them
on
the
spot
on
my
observing
the
signature
of
affixed
to
these
productions
he
smiled
and
said
with
much
complacency
my
name
is
david
moir
this
upon
inquiry
we
found
was
really
the
case
and
the
mad
poet
considered
that
the
coincidence
gave
him
a
right
to
enjoy
the
fame
of
his
celebrated
namesake
the
poems
which
he
gave
us
and
which
are
still
in
my
possession
contain
some
lines
of
great
merit
but
they
are
strangely
unconnected
and
very
defective
in
rhyme
and
keeping
he
watched
our
countenances
intently
while
reading
them
continually
stepping
in
and
pointing
out
to
us
his
favourite
passages
we
were
going
to
return
them
but
he
bade
us
keep
them
he
had
hundreds
of
copies
of
them
he
said
in
his
head
he
then
took
us
on
one
side
and
intreated
us
in
the
most
pathetic
manner
to
use
our
influence
to
get
him
out
of
that
place
he
was
he
said
a
good
classic
scholar
and
had
been
private
tutor
in
several
families
of
high
respectability
and
he
could
shew
us
testimonials
as
to
character
and
ability
it
is
hard
to
keep
me
here
idling
he
continued
when
my
poor
little
boys
want
me
so
badly
at
home
poor
fellows
and
they
have
no
mother
to
supply
my
place
he
sighed
heavily
and
drew
his
hand
across
his
brow
and
looked
sadly
and
dreamily
into
the
blue
distance
of
ontario
the
madman
thoughts
were
far
away
with
his
young
sons
or
perhaps
had
ranged
back
to
the
rugged
heathery
hills
of
his
own
glorious
mountain
land
there
were
two
boys
among
these
men
who
in
spite
of
their
lunacy
had
an
eye
to
business
and
begged
pathetically
for
coppers
though
of
what
use
they
could
be
to
them
in
that
place
i
can
not
imagine
i
saw
no
girls
under
twelve
years
of
age
there
were
several
boys
who
appeared
scarcely
in
their
teens
mounting
another
flight
of
snowy
stairs
we
came
to
the
wards
above
those
we
had
just
inspected
these
were
occupied
by
patients
that
were
not
in
a
state
to
allow
visitors
a
nearer
inspection
than
observing
them
through
the
glass
doors
by
standing
upon
a
short
flight
of
broad
steps
that
led
down
to
their
ward
we
were
able
to
do
this
with
perfect
security
the
hands
of
all
these
women
were
secured
in
mufflers
some
were
dancing
others
running
to
and
fro
at
full
speed
clapping
their
hands
and
laughing
and
shouting
with
the
most
boisterous
merriment
how
dreadful
is
the
laugh
of
madness
how
sorrowful
the
expressions
of
their
diabolical
mirth
tears
and
lamentations
would
have
been
less
shocking
for
it
would
have
seemed
more
natural
among
these
raving
maniacs
i
recognised
the
singular
face
of
grace
marks
no
longer
sad
and
despairing
but
lighted
up
with
the
fire
of
insanity
and
glowing
with
a
hideous
and
merriment
on
perceiving
that
strangers
were
observing
her
she
fled
shrieking
away
like
a
phantom
into
one
of
the
side
rooms
it
appears
that
even
in
the
wildest
bursts
of
her
terrible
malady
she
is
continually
haunted
by
a
memory
of
the
past
unhappy
girl
when
will
the
long
horror
of
her
punishment
and
remorse
be
over
when
will
she
sit
at
the
feet
of
jesus
clothed
with
the
unsullied
garments
of
his
righteousness
the
stain
of
blood
washed
from
her
hand
and
her
soul
redeemed
and
pardoned
and
in
her
right
mind
it
is
fearful
to
look
at
her
and
contemplate
her
fate
in
connexion
with
her
crime
what
a
striking
illustration
does
it
afford
of
that
awful
text
vengeance
is
mine
i
will
repay
saith
the
lord
there
was
one
woman
in
this
ward
with
raven
hair
and
eyes
and
a
sallow
unhealthy
complexion
whom
the
sight
of
us
transported
into
a
paroxysm
of
ungovernable
rage
she
rushed
to
the
door
and
doubled
her
fists
at
us
and
began
cursing
and
swearing
at
a
furious
rate
and
then
she
laughed
such
a
laugh
as
one
might
fancy
satan
uttered
when
he
recounted
in
full
conclave
his
triumph
over
the
credulity
of
our
first
mother
presently
she
grew
outrageous
and
had
to
be
thrown
to
the
ground
and
secured
by
two
keepers
but
to
silence
her
was
beyond
their
art
she
lay
kicking
and
foaming
and
uttering
words
too
dreadful
for
human
ears
to
listen
to
and
grace
marks
came
out
from
her
and
performed
a
thousand
mad
gambols
round
her
and
we
turned
from
the
piteous
scene
and
i
for
one
fervently
thanked
god
for
my
sanity
and
inwardly
repeated
those
exquisite
lines
of
the
peasant
bard
of
my
native
county
oh
thou
who
the
vernal
juices
rise
thou
on
whose
blast
autumnal
foliage
flies
let
peace
leave
me
nor
my
heart
grow
cold
whilst
life
and
sanity
are
mine
to
hold
we
cast
but
a
cursory
glance
on
the
men
who
occupied
the
opposite
ward
we
had
seen
enough
of
madness
and
the
shrieks
from
the
outrageous
patients
above
whom
strangers
have
seldom
nerve
enough
to
visit
quickened
our
steps
as
we
hurried
from
the
place
we
looked
into
the
large
before
we
descended
the
stairs
where
these
poor
creatures
are
allowed
at
stated
times
to
meet
for
pleasure
and
amusement
but
such
a
spectacle
would
be
to
me
more
revolting
than
the
scene
i
had
just
witnessed
the
delirium
of
their
frightful
disease
would
be
less
shocking
in
my
eyes
than
the
madness
of
their
mirth
the
struggling
gleams
of
sense
and
memory
in
these
unhappy
people
reminded
me
a
beautiful
passage
in
tupper
proverbial
philosophy
on
all
things
created
remaineth
the
signature
of
god
somewhat
of
fair
and
good
though
blotted
by
the
finger
of
corruption
what
a
sublime
truth
how
beautifully
and
forcibly
expressed
with
what
a
mournful
dignity
it
invests
our
fallen
nature
sin
has
marred
the
divine
image
in
which
we
were
made
but
the
soul
in
its
intense
longing
after
god
and
good
bears
in
its
sorrowful
servitude
to
evil
the
impress
of
the
hand
that
formed
it
happy
and
free
yes
even
in
the
most
abject
and
fallen
some
slight
trace
of
good
remains
some
spark
of
the
divine
essence
that
still
lingers
amid
the
darkness
and
corruption
of
guilt
to
rekindle
the
dying
embers
and
restore
them
once
more
to
life
and
liberty
the
madman
raving
in
his
chains
still
remembers
his
god
to
bless
or
blaspheme
his
name
we
are
astonished
at
his
ecstatic
dream
of
happiness
or
shocked
beyond
measure
at
the
blackness
of
his
despair
his
superhuman
strength
fills
us
with
wonder
and
even
in
the
extinction
of
reason
we
acknowledge
the
eternal
presence
of
god
and
perceive
flashes
of
his
spirit
breaking
through
the
dark
material
cloud
that
shades
but
can
not
wholly
annihilate
the
light
of
the
soul
the
immortality
within
the
poor
senseless
idiot
who
appears
to
moral
eyes
a
mere
living
machine
a
body
without
a
soul
sitting
among
the
grass
and
playing
with
the
flowers
and
pebbles
in
the
vacancy
of
his
mind
is
still
a
wonderful
illustration
of
the
wisdom
and
power
of
god
we
behold
a
human
being
inferior
in
instinct
and
intelligence
of
the
meanest
orders
of
animal
life
dependent
upon
the
common
charities
of
his
kind
for
subsistence
yet
conscious
of
the
friend
who
pities
his
helplessness
and
of
the
hand
that
administers
to
his
wants
the
spirit
of
his
maker
shall
yet
breathe
upon
the
dull
chaos
of
his
stagnant
brain
and
open
the
eyes
of
this
blind
of
soul
into
the
light
of
his
own
eternal
day
what
a
lesson
to
the
pride
of
man
to
the
vain
dwellers
in
houses
of
clay
returning
from
the
asylum
we
stopped
to
examine
trinity
college
which
is
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
the
architect
tully
has
shown
considerable
taste
and
genius
in
the
design
of
this
edifice
which
like
the
asylum
is
built
of
white
brick
the
corners
doors
and
windows
faced
with
cut
stone
it
stands
back
from
the
road
in
a
fine
lawn
surrounded
by
stately
trees
of
nature
own
planting
when
the
college
is
completed
it
will
be
one
of
the
finest
public
buildings
in
the
province
and
form
one
of
the
noblest
ornaments
to
this
part
of
the
city
the
maniac
the
wind
at
my
casement
scream
shrilly
and
loud
and
the
pale
moon
look
in
from
her
mantle
of
cloud
old
ocean
was
tossing
in
terrible
might
and
the
black
rolling
billows
were
crested
with
light
like
a
shadowy
dream
on
my
senses
that
hour
stole
the
beautiful
vision
of
grandeur
and
power
and
the
sorrows
of
life
that
brought
tears
to
mine
eye
were
forgot
in
the
glories
of
ocean
and
sky
nature
i
cried
thy
beautiful
face
all
the
wisdom
and
love
of
thy
maker
i
trace
thy
aspect
divine
checks
my
tears
as
they
start
and
fond
hopes
long
banish
flow
back
to
my
heart
thus
musing
i
wander
alone
to
the
shore
to
gaze
on
the
waters
and
list
to
their
roar
when
i
saw
a
poor
lost
one
bend
over
the
steep
of
the
tall
beetling
cliff
that
juts
out
the
deep
the
wind
wav
her
garments
and
april
rash
showers
hung
like
gems
in
her
dark
locks
enwreath
with
wild
flowers
her
bosom
was
bared
to
the
cold
midnight
storm
that
unsparingly
beat
on
her
thin
fragile
form
her
black
eyes
flash
sternly
whence
reason
had
fled
and
she
glanc
on
my
sight
like
some
ghost
of
the
dead
as
she
sang
a
loud
strain
to
the
hoarse
dashing
surge
that
rang
on
my
ears
like
the
plaint
of
a
dirge
and
he
who
had
left
her
to
madness
and
shame
who
had
robb
her
of
honour
and
blasted
her
fame
did
he
think
in
that
hour
of
the
heart
he
had
riven
the
vows
he
had
broken
the
anguish
he
given
and
where
was
the
infant
whose
birth
gave
the
blow
to
the
peace
of
his
mother
and
madden
her
woe
a
thought
rush
across
me
i
ask
for
her
child
with
a
wild
laugh
of
triumph
the
maniac
replied
the
dark
tide
runs
strongest
the
cliff
rises
steep
where
the
wild
waters
eddy
i
rock
him
to
sleep
his
sleep
is
so
sound
that
the
rush
of
the
stream
when
the
winds
are
abroad
can
not
waken
his
dream
and
see
you
that
rock
with
its
side
there
the
blood
of
my
false
love
runs
red
with
the
tide
the
screams
shrilly
the
white
breakers
rave
in
the
foam
of
the
billow
i
dance
his
grave
the
roar
of
the
tempest
the
wind
hollow
moan
there
rose
on
my
chill
ear
a
faint
dying
groan
the
billows
raged
on
the
moon
smiled
on
the
flood
but
vacant
the
spot
where
the
maniac
had
stood
i
turn
from
the
scene
on
my
spirit
there
fell
a
question
that
sadden
my
heart
like
a
knell
i
look
up
to
but
i
breath
not
a
word
for
the
answer
was
given
thou
in
the
lord
chapter
xvi
provincial
agricultural
show
a
happy
scene
of
rural
mirth
drawn
from
the
teeming
lap
of
earth
in
which
a
nation
promise
lies
honour
to
him
who
wins
a
prize
a
trophy
won
by
honest
toil
far
nobler
than
the
victor
spoil
toronto
was
all
bustle
and
excitement
preparing
for
the
provincial
agricultural
show
no
other
subject
was
thought
of
or
talked
about
the
ladies
too
taking
advantage
of
the
great
influx
of
strangers
to
the
city
were
to
hold
a
bazaar
for
the
benefit
of
george
church
the
sum
which
they
hoped
to
realise
by
the
sale
of
their
fancy
wares
to
be
appropriated
to
paying
off
the
remaining
debt
contracted
for
the
said
saint
in
erecting
this
handsome
edifice
dedicated
to
his
name
let
us
hope
not
to
his
service
yet
the
idea
of
erecting
a
temple
for
the
worship
of
god
and
calling
it
the
church
of
a
saint
of
doubtful
is
one
of
those
laughable
absurdities
that
we
would
gladly
see
banished
in
this
enlightened
age
truly
there
are
many
things
in
which
our
wisdom
does
not
exceed
the
wisdom
of
our
forefathers
the
weather
during
the
two
first
days
of
the
exhibition
was
very
unpropitious
a
succession
of
drenching
thunder
showers
succeeded
by
warm
bursts
of
sunshine
promising
better
things
and
giving
rise
to
hopes
in
the
expectant
visitants
to
the
show
which
were
as
often
doomed
to
be
disappointed
by
returns
of
blackness
storm
and
pouring
rain
i
was
very
anxious
to
hear
the
opening
address
and
i
must
confess
that
i
was
among
those
who
felt
this
annihilation
of
hope
very
severely
and
being
an
invalid
i
dared
not
venture
upon
the
grounds
before
wednesday
morning
when
this
most
interesting
part
of
the
performance
was
over
wednesday
however
was
as
beautiful
a
september
day
as
the
most
sanguine
of
the
agricultural
exhibitors
could
desire
and
the
fine
space
allotted
for
the
display
of
the
various
objects
of
industry
was
crowded
to
overflowing
it
was
a
glorious
scene
for
those
who
had
the
interest
of
the
colony
at
heart
every
district
of
the
upper
province
had
contributed
its
portion
of
labour
talent
and
ingenuity
to
furnish
forth
the
show
the
products
of
the
soil
the
anvil
and
the
loom
met
the
eye
at
every
turn
the
genius
of
the
mechanic
was
displayed
in
the
effective
articles
of
machinery
invented
to
assist
the
toils
and
shorten
the
labour
of
human
hands
and
were
many
and
excellent
in
their
kind
improvements
in
old
implements
and
others
entirely
new
were
shown
or
put
into
active
operation
by
the
inventors
those
real
benefactors
to
the
human
race
to
whom
the
exploits
of
conquerors
however
startling
and
brilliant
are
very
inferior
in
every
sense
mechanical
genius
which
ought
to
be
regarded
as
the
first
and
greatest
effort
of
human
intellect
is
only
now
beginning
to
be
recognised
as
such
the
statesman
warrior
poet
painter
orator
and
man
of
letters
all
have
their
niche
in
the
temple
of
fame
all
have
had
their
worshippers
and
admirers
but
who
among
them
has
celebrated
in
song
and
tale
the
grand
creative
power
which
can
make
inanimate
metals
move
and
act
and
almost
live
in
the
wondrous
machinery
of
the
present
day
it
is
the
mind
that
conceived
the
hand
that
reduced
to
practical
usefulness
these
miraculous
instruments
with
all
their
complicated
works
moving
in
harmony
and
performing
their
appointed
office
that
comes
nearest
to
the
sublime
intelligence
that
framed
the
universe
and
gave
life
and
motion
to
that
astonishing
piece
of
mechanism
the
human
form
in
watching
the
movements
of
the
one
can
hardly
divest
one
self
of
the
idea
that
it
possesses
life
and
consciousness
true
the
metal
is
but
a
dead
agent
but
the
spirit
of
the
originator
still
lives
in
it
and
sways
it
to
the
gigantic
will
that
first
gave
it
motion
and
power
and
oh
what
wonders
has
it
not
achieved
what
obstacles
has
it
not
overcome
how
has
it
brought
near
things
that
were
far
off
and
crumbled
into
dust
difficulties
which
at
first
sight
appeared
insurmountable
honour
to
the
child
of
springs
and
wheels
at
whose
head
stands
the
great
founder
of
the
world
the
grandest
humanity
that
ever
trode
the
earth
rejoice
and
shout
for
joy
ye
sons
of
the
rule
and
line
for
was
he
not
one
of
you
did
he
not
condescend
to
bow
that
form
over
the
carpenter
bench
and
handle
the
plane
and
saw
yours
should
be
termed
the
divine
craft
and
those
who
follow
it
truly
noble
your
great
master
was
above
the
little
things
of
earth
he
knew
the
true
dignity
of
man
that
virtue
conferred
the
same
majesty
upon
its
possessor
in
the
workshop
or
the
palace
that
the
soul
title
to
rank
as
a
son
of
god
required
neither
high
birth
nor
the
adventitious
claims
of
wealth
that
the
simple
name
of
a
good
man
was
a
more
abiding
honour
even
in
this
world
than
that
of
kings
or
emperors
oh
ye
sons
of
labour
seek
to
attain
this
true
dignity
inherent
in
your
nature
and
cease
to
envy
the
possessors
of
those
ephemeral
honours
that
perish
with
the
perishing
things
of
this
world
the
time
is
coming
is
now
even
at
the
doors
when
education
shall
give
you
a
truer
standing
in
society
and
good
men
throughout
the
whole
world
shall
recognise
each
other
as
brothers
an
the
earth
gude
sense
an
worth
shall
bear
the
gree
an
a
that
carried
away
from
my
subject
by
an
impetuous
current
of
thought
i
must
step
back
to
the
show
from
which
i
derived
a
great
deal
of
satisfaction
and
pleasure
the
space
in
which
it
was
exhibited
contained
i
am
told
about
sixteen
acres
the
rear
of
this
where
the
animals
were
shown
was
a
large
grove
covered
with
tall
spreading
trees
beneath
the
shade
of
which
reposing
or
standing
in
the
most
picturesque
attitudes
were
to
be
seen
the
finest
breeds
of
cattle
horses
and
sheep
in
the
province
this
inclosure
was
surrounded
by
a
high
boarded
fence
against
which
pens
were
erected
for
the
accommodation
of
pigs
fat
sleepy
lambs
and
wild
mischievous
goats
while
noble
horses
were
led
to
and
fro
by
their
owners
or
their
servants
snorting
and
curveting
in
all
the
conscious
pride
of
strength
and
beauty
these
handsome
creatures
might
be
considered
the
aristocracy
of
the
animal
department
yet
in
spite
of
their
prancing
hoofs
arched
necks
and
glances
of
fire
they
had
to
labour
in
their
vocation
as
well
as
the
poorest
pig
that
grunted
and
panted
in
its
close
pen
there
was
a
donkey
there
a
solitary
ass
the
first
of
his
kind
i
ever
beheld
in
the
province
unused
to
such
a
stir
and
bustle
he
lifted
up
his
voice
and
made
the
grove
ring
with
his
discordant
notes
the
horses
bounded
and
reared
and
glanced
down
upon
him
in
such
mad
disdain
that
they
could
scarcely
be
controlled
by
their
keepers
i
can
imagine
the
astonishment
they
must
have
felt
on
hearing
the
first
bray
of
an
ass
they
could
not
have
appeared
more
startled
at
a
lion
roar
whoever
exhibited
braham
was
a
brave
man
a
gentleman
who
settled
in
the
neighbourhood
of
peterboro
twenty
years
ago
brought
out
a
donkey
with
him
to
canada
and
until
the
day
of
his
death
he
went
by
no
other
name
than
the
undignified
one
of
donkey
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
the
donkey
would
be
a
very
useful
creature
in
the
colony
though
rather
an
untractable
democrat
insisting
on
having
things
his
own
way
he
is
a
hardy
patient
fellow
and
easily
kept
and
though
very
obstinate
is
by
no
means
insensible
to
kind
treatment
or
incapable
of
attachment
and
then
as
an
of
canadian
he
would
prove
an
invaluable
reformer
by
removing
these
agricultural
pests
out
of
the
way
often
have
i
gazed
upon
the
that
prolific
sturdy
democrat
of
the
soil
that
rudely
jostles
aside
its
more
delicate
and
valued
neighbours
elbowing
them
from
their
places
with
its
and
armed
foliage
and
asked
myself
for
what
purpose
it
grew
and
flourished
so
abundantly
surely
it
must
have
some
useful
qualities
some
good
must
lie
hidden
under
its
hardy
structure
and
coat
of
mail
independently
of
its
exercising
those
valuable
qualities
in
man
patience
and
industry
which
must
be
called
into
active
operation
in
order
to
root
it
out
and
hinder
it
from
destroying
the
fruits
of
his
labour
the
time
perhaps
may
arrive
when
its
thick
milky
juices
and
oily
roots
may
be
found
to
yield
nutricious
food
or
afford
a
soothing
narcotic
to
alleviate
the
restless
tossings
of
pain
i
firmly
believe
that
nothing
has
been
made
in
vain
that
every
animate
and
inanimate
substance
has
its
use
although
we
may
be
ignorant
of
it
that
the
most
perfect
and
beautiful
harmony
reigns
over
the
visible
world
that
although
we
may
foolishly
despise
those
animals
plants
and
insects
that
we
consider
noxious
because
their
real
utility
has
never
been
tested
by
experience
they
are
absolutely
necessary
as
links
in
the
great
chain
of
providence
and
appointed
to
fulfil
a
special
purpose
and
end
what
shall
we
do
for
firewood
when
all
the
forests
are
burned
was
a
very
natural
question
asked
us
the
other
day
by
a
young
friend
who
with
very
scanty
means
contemplated
with
a
sort
of
horror
the
increased
demand
for
fuel
and
its
increasing
price
tupper
has
an
admirable
answer
for
all
such
queries
yet
man
heedless
of
a
god
counteth
up
vain
reckonings
fearing
to
be
jostled
and
starved
out
by
the
too
prolific
increase
of
his
kind
and
asketh
in
unbelieving
dread
for
how
few
years
to
come
will
the
black
cellars
of
the
world
yield
unto
him
fuel
for
his
winter
might
not
the
wide
waste
sea
be
bent
into
narrower
bounds
might
not
the
arm
of
diligence
make
the
tangled
wilderness
a
garden
and
for
aught
thou
tell
there
may
be
a
thousand
methods
of
comforting
thy
limbs
in
warmth
though
thou
kindle
not
a
spark
fear
not
son
of
man
for
thyself
nor
thy
seed
with
a
multitude
is
plenty
god
blessing
giveth
increase
and
with
it
larger
than
enough
surely
it
is
folly
for
any
one
to
despair
of
the
future
while
the
providence
of
god
superintends
the
affairs
of
the
universe
is
it
not
sinful
to
doubt
the
power
of
that
being
who
fed
a
vast
multitude
from
a
few
loaves
and
small
fishes
is
his
arm
shortened
that
he
can
no
longer
produce
those
articles
that
are
indispensable
and
necessary
for
the
health
and
comfort
of
the
creatures
dependent
upon
his
bounty
what
millions
have
been
fed
by
the
introduction
of
the
potato
plant
that
wild
native
of
the
chilian
mountains
when
first
exhibited
as
a
curiousity
by
sir
walter
raleigh
who
could
have
imagined
the
astonishing
results
not
only
in
feeding
the
multitudes
that
for
several
ages
in
ireland
it
has
fed
but
that
the
very
blight
upon
it
by
stopping
an
easy
mode
of
obtaining
food
should
be
the
instrument
in
the
hands
of
the
great
father
to
induce
these
impoverished
starving
children
of
an
unhappy
country
to
remove
to
lands
where
honest
toil
would
be
amply
remunerated
and
produce
greater
blessings
for
them
than
the
precarious
support
afforded
by
an
esculent
root
we
have
faith
unbounded
faith
in
the
benevolent
care
of
the

father
faith
in
the
fertility
of
the
earth
and
her
capabilities
of
supporting
to
the
end
of
time
her
numerous
offspring
the
of
old
settled
countries
may
appear
to
a
casual
thinker
a
dreadful
calamity
and
yet
it
is
but
the
natural
means
employed
by
providence
to
force
the
poorer
classes
by
the
strong
law
of
necessity
to
emigrate
and
spread
themselves
over
the
earth
in
order
to
bring
into
cultivation
and
usefulness
its
waste
places
when
the
world
can
no
longer
maintain
its
inhabitants
it
will
be
struck
out
of
being
by
the
fiat
of
him
who
called
it
into
existence
nothing
has
contributed
more
to
the
rapid
advance
of
the
province
than
the
institution
of
the
agricultural
society
and
from
it
we
are
already
reaping
the
most
beneficial
results
it
has
stirred
up
a
spirit
of
emulation
in
a
large
class
of
people
who
were
very
supine
in
their
method
of
cultivating
their
lands
who
instead
of
improving
them
and
making
them
produce
not
only
the
largest
quantity
of
grain
but
that
of
the
best
quality
were
quite
contented
if
they
reaped
enough
from
their
slovenly
farming
to
supply
the
wants
of
their
family
of
a
very
inferior
sort
now
we
behold
a
laudable
struggle
among
the
tillers
of
the
soil
as
to
which
shall
send
the
best
specimens
of
good
husbandry
to
contend
for
the
prizes
at
the
provincial
shows
where
very
large
sums
of
money
are
expended
in
providing
handsome
premiums
for
the
victors
all
the
leading
men
in
the
province
are
members
of
this
truly
honourable
institution
and
many
of
them
send
horses
and
the
growth
of
their
gardens
to
add
to
the
general
bustle
and
excitement
of
the
scene
the
summer
before
last
my
husband
took
the
second
prize
for
wheat
at
the
provincial
show
and
i
must
frankly
own
that
i
felt
as
proud
of
it
as
if
it
had
been
the
same
sum
bestowed
upon
a
prize
poem
there
was
an
immense
display
of
farm
produce
on
the
present
occasion
at
toronto
all
excellent
in
their
kind
the
agricultural
hall
a
large
temporary
building
of
boards
was
completely
filled
with
the
fruits
of
the
earth
and
the
products
of
the
dairy
a
glorious
sight
if
glory
dwells
below
where
heaven
munificence
makes
all
the
show
the
most
delicious
butter
and
tempting
cheese
quite
equal
perhaps
to
the
renowned
british
in
every
thing
but
the
name
were
displayed
in
the
greatest
abundance
a
hiram
ranney
from
the
brock
district
contributed
a
monster
cheese
weighing
not
made
of
double
skimmed
but
of
milk
of
the
richest
quality
which
from
its
size
and
appearance
might
have
feasted
all
the
rats
and
mice
in
the
province
for
the
next
twelve
months
it
was
large
enough
to
have
made
the
good
old
deity
of
heathen
times
her
godship
of
the
earth
an
agricultural
throne
while
from
the
floral
hall
close
at
hand
a
crown
could
have
been
woven
on
the
shortest
notice
of
the
choicest
buds
from
her
own
inexhaustible
treasury
a
great
quantity
of
fine
flax
and
hemp
particularly
attracted
my
attention
both
grow
admirably
in
this
country
and
at
no
very
distant
period
will
form
staple
articles
for
home
manufacture
and
foreign
export
the
vast
improvement
in
cloth
blankets
flannels
shawls
carpeting
and
counterpanes
was
very
apparent
over
the
same
articles
in
former
years
in
a
short
time
canada
need
not
be
beholden
to
any
foreign
country
for
articles
of
comfort
and
convenience
in
these
things
her
real
wealth
and
strength
are
shown
and
we
may
well
augur
from
what
she
has
already
achieved
in
this
line
how
much
more
she
can
do
and
do
well
with
credit
and
profit
to
herself
the
sheep
in
canada
are
not
subject
to
the
diseases
which
carry
off
so
many
yearly
in
britain
and
though
these
animals
have
to
be
housed
during
the
winter
they
are
a
very
profitable
stock
the
canadian
mutton
is
not
so
large
as
it
is
in
england
and
in
flavour
and
texture
more
nearly
resembles
the
scotch
it
has
more
of
a
young
flavour
and
to
my
thinking
affords
a
more
wholesome
profitable
article
of
consumption
beef
is
very
inferior
to
the
british
but
since
the
attention
of
the
people
has
been
more
intently
directed
to
their
agricultural
interests
there
is
a
decided
improvement
in
this
respect
and
the
condition
of
all
the
meat
sent
to
market
is
ten
per
cent
better
than
the
lean
hard
animals
we
used
to
purchase
for
winter
provisions
when
we
first
came
to
the
province
at
that
time
they
had
a
race
of
pigs
tall
and
gaunt
with
fierce
bristling
manes
that
wandered
about
the
roads
and
woods
seeking
what
they
could
devour
like
famished
wolves
you
might
have
pronounced
them
without
any
great
stretch
of
imagination
descended
from
the
same
stock
into
which
the
attendant
fiends
that
possessed
the
poor
maniacs
of
galilee
had
been
cast
so
many
ages
ago
i
knew
a
gentleman
who
was
attacked
in
the
bush
by
a
sow
of
this
ferocious
breed
who
fairly
treed
him
in
the
woods
of
douro
and
kept
him
on
his
uncomfortable
perch
during
several
hours
until
his
swinish
enemy
patience
was
exhausted
and
she
had
to
give
up
her
supper
of
human
flesh
for
the
more
natural
products
of
the
forest
acorns
and
talking
of
pigs
and
sheep
recals
to
my
mind
an
amusing
anecdote
told
to
me
by
a
resident
of
one
of
our
back
townships
which
illustrates
even
in
a
cruel
act
of
retaliation
the
dry
humour
which
so
strongly
characterizes
the
lower
class
of
emigrants
from
the
emerald
isle
i
will
give
it
in
my
young
friend
own
words
in
one
of
our
back
townships
there
lived
an
old
dutchman
who
was
of
such
a
vindictive
temper
that
none
of
his
neighbours
could
remain
at
peace
with
him
he
made
the
owners
of
the
next
farm
so
miserable
that
they
were
obliged
to
sell
out
and
leave
the
place
the
farm
passed
through
many
hands
and
at
last
became
vacant
for
no
one
could
stay
on
it
more
than
a
few
months
they
were
so
worried
and
annoyed
by
this
spiteful
old
man
who
upon
the
slightest
occasion
threw
down
their
fences
and
injured
their
cattle
in
short
the
poor
people
began
to
suspect
that
he
was
the
devil
himself
sent
among
them
as
a
punishment
for
their
sins
at
last
an
irish
emigrant
lately
out
was
offered
the
place
very
cheap
and
to
the
astonishment
of
all
bought
it
in
spite
of
the
bad
for
the
future
residence
of
himself
and
family
he
had
not
been
long
on
the
new
place
when
one
of
his
sheep
which
had
got
through
a
hole
in
the
dutchman
fence
came
hobbling
home
with
one
of
its
legs
stuck
through
the
other
now
you
must
know
that
this
man
who
was
so
active
in
punishing
the
trespasses
of
his
neighbours
cattle
and
stock
was
not
at
all
particular
in
keeping
his
own
at
home
there
happened
to
be
an
old
sow
of
his
who
was
very
fond
of
pat
and
a
constant
to
him
just
then
in
the
field
when
the
sheep
came
home
pat
took
the
old
sow
not
very
tenderly
i
afraid
by
the
ear
and
drawing
out
his
very
deliberately
slit
her
mouth
on
either
side
as
far
as
he
could
by
and
by
the
old
dutchman
came
puffing
and
blowing
along
and
seeing
pat
sitting
upon
his
enjoying
the
evening
air
and
comfortably
smoking
his
pipe
he
asked
him
if
he
had
seen
anything
of
his
sow
neighbour
said
pat
putting
on
one
of
his
gravest
faces
of
the
strangest
things
happened
a
short
while
ago
that
i
ever
saw
a
sheep
of
mine
came
home
with
its
leg
slit
and
the
other
put
through
it
and
your
old
sow
was
so
amused
with
the
odd
sight
that
she
split
her
jaws
with
laughing
this
turned
the
tables
upon
the
spiteful
old
man
and
completely
cured
him
of
all
his
tricks
he
is
now
one
of
the
best
neighbours
in
the
township
this
was
but
a
poor
reparation
to
the
poor
sheep
and
the
old
sow
their
sufferings
appear
to
have
been
regarded
by
both
parties
as
a
very
minor
consideration
the
hall
set
apart
for
the
display
of
fancy
work
and
the
fine
arts
appeared
to
be
the
great
centre
of
attraction
for
it
was
almost
impossible
to
force
your
way
through
the
dense
crowd
or
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
pictures
exhibited
by
native
artists
the
show
of
these
was
highly
creditable
indeed
eight
pictures
illustrative
of
indian
scenery
character
and
customs
by
paul
kane
would
have
done
honour
to
any
exhibition
for
correctness
of
design
beauty
of
colouring
and
a
faithful
representation
of
the
peculiar
scenery
of
this
continent
they
could
scarcely
be
surpassed
i
stood
for
a
long
time
intently
examining
these
interesting
pictures
when
a
tall
fellow
in
the
grey
homespun
of
the
country
who
i
suppose
thought
that
i
had
my
share
of
enjoyment
in
that
department
very
coolly
took
me
by
the
shoulders
pulled
me
back
into
the
crowd
and
possessed
himself
of
my
vacant
place
this
man
should
have
formed
a
class
with
the
two
large
tame
bears
exhibited
on
the
ground
appropriated
to
the
poultry
but
i
rather
think
that
bruin
and
his
brother
would
have
been
ashamed
of
having
him
added
to
their
fraternity
seeing
that
their
conduct
was
quite
unexceptionable
and
they
could
have
a
set
a
good
example
to
numbers
of
the
human
bipeds
who
pushed
and
elbowed
from
side
to
side
anything
that
obstructed
their
path
while
a
little
common
courtesy
would
have
secured
to
themselves
and
others
a
far
better
opportunity
of
examining
everything
carefully
the
greatest
nuisance
in
this
respect
was
a
multitude
of
small
children
who
were
completely
hidden
in
the
press
and
whose
feet
hands
and
head
dealt
blows
against
which
it
was
impossible
to
protect
yourself
as
you
felt
severely
without
being
able
to
ward
off
their
it
is
plain
that
they
could
not
see
at
all
but
were
determined
that
every
one
should
sensibly
their
disappointment
it
was
impossible
to
stop
for
a
moment
to
examine
this
most
interesting
portion
of
the
exhibition
and
one
was
really
glad
to
force
a
passage
out
of
the
press
into
the
free
air
large
placards
were
pasted
about
in
the
most
conspicuous
places
warning
visitors
to
the
grounds
to
look
out
for
pickpockets
every
one
was
on
the
alert
to
discover
these
gentry
expecting
them
i
suppose
to
be
classed
like
the
animal
and
vegetable
productions
of
the
soil
and
the
vicinity
of
a
pedlar
who
was
selling
yankee
notions
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
always
surrounded
by
a
great
mob
was
considered
the
most
likely
locality
for
these
invisible
personages
who
i
firmly
believe
existed
alone
in
the
fancy
of
the
authors
of
the
aforesaid
placards
there
was
a
very
fine
display
of
the
improved
and
foreign
breeds
of
poultry
and
a
set
of
idle
irish
loungers
of
the
lower
class
were
amusing
themselves
by
inserting
the
bowls
of
their
pipes
into
the
pens
that
contained
these
noble
fowls
and
giving
them
the
benefit
of
a
good
smoking
the
intoxicating
effects
of
the
fumes
of
the
tobacco
upon
the
poor
creatures
appeared
to
afford
their
tormentors
the
greatest
entertainment
the
stately
cocks
shook
their
plumed
heads
and
turned
up
their
beaks
with
unmistakeable
signs
of
annoyance
and
disgust
and
two
fine
fowls
that
were
lying
dead
outside
the
pens
were
probably
killed
by
this
novel
sport
i
was
greatly
struck
by
the
appearance
of
okah
tubee
the
celebrated
indian
doctor
who
was
certainly
the
most
person
in
the
show
and
on
a
less
public
occasion
would
have
drawn
a
large
number
of
spectators
on
his
own
hook
okah
tubee
is
a
broad
stout
powerfully
built
man
with
a
large
fat
face
set
off
to
the
least
possible
advantage
by
round
rings
of
braided
hair
tied
with
blue
ribbons
and
with
large
gold
in
his
ears
now
it
certainly
is
true
that
a
man
has
a
perfect
right
to
dress
his
hair
in
this
fashion
or
in
any
fashion
he
pleases
but
a
more
absurd
appearance
than
the
blue
ribbons
gave
to
his
broad
brown
beardless
face
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
the
solemn
dignity
too
with
which
he
carried
off
this
tomfoolery
was
not
the
least
laughable
part
of
it
i
wonder
which
of
his
wives
for
i
was
told
he
had
several
braided
all
these
small
rings
of
hair
and
confined
them
with
the
blue
but
it
is
more
than
probable
that
the
grave
indian
performed
his
own
toilet
his
blue
surtout
beaver
hat
accorded
ill
with
his
indian
leggings
and
moccassins
i
must
think
that
the
big
man
dress
was
in
shocking
bad
taste
and
decided
failure
i
missed
the
sight
of
him
carrying
a
flag
in
the
procession
and
mounted
on
horseback
if
his
matched
his
walking
costume
it
must
have
been
rich
leaving
the
we
next
directed
our
steps
to
the
bazaar
that
was
held
in
the
government
buildings
and
here
we
found
a
number
of
elegant
women
sitting
like
mathew
at
the
receipt
of
custom
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
their
labours
of
love
received
an
ample
recompense
and
that
the
sale
of
their
pretty
toys
completely
discharged
the
debt
that
had
been
incurred
for
their
favourite
saint
nor
was
the
glory
of
old
england
likely
to
be
forgotten
amid
such
a
display
of
national

adorned
the
spacious

diverted
my
thoughts
for
a
long
while
from
the

and
the
drizzling
rain
and
when
it
had
been
read

and
pondered
over
for
some
time
and

inwardly
thanked
for
the
affection
that
breathed
in

the
good

it
contained
the
unpromising
mist
had
all
cleared
away
and
the
sun
was
casting
bright
silvery
gleams
across
the
broad
bosom
of
the
beautiful
ontario
we
did
not
meet
with
a
solitary
adventure
on
our
very
pleasant
voyage
the
deep
blue
autumnal
sky
and
the
waters
forming
the
chief
attraction
and
giving
rise
to
pleasant
trains
of
thought
till
the
spirit
blended
and
harmonized
with
the
grand
and
simple
elements
that
composed
the
scene
there
were
no
passengers
in
the
ladies
cabin
and
we
never
left
the
deck
of
the
steamer
until
she
came
to
her
wharf
at
queenstone
the
lake
for
some
miles
before
you
reach
the
entrance
of
the
niagara
river
assumes
a
tint
quite
different
from
the
ordinary
deep
blue
of
its
waters
this
is
probably
owing
to
the
vast
quantity
of
soil
washed
down
by
the
rapids
from
the
high
lands
above
the
captain
told
us
that
after
a
storm
such
as
we
had
experienced
on
the
preceding
night
this
appearance
though
it
always
existed
was
more
apparent
you
catch
a
distant
glance
of
the
falls
from
this
part
of
the
lake
but
it
is
only
in
the
shape
of
a
light
silvery
cloud
hovering
on
the
edge
of
the
horizon
we
listened
in
vain
for
any
sound
to
give
us
an
indication
of
their
near
vicinity
the
voice
of
nature
was
mute
the
roar
of
the
great
cataract
was
not
distinguishable
at
that
distance
the
entrance
to
the
niagara
river
is
very
interesting
you
pass
between
the
two
strong
stone
forts
raised
for
the
protection
of
their
respective
countries
and
a
hostile
vessel
would
stand
but
a
small
chance
of
keeping
clear
from
danger
in
passing
either
cerberus
it
is
devoutly
to
be
hoped
that
all
such
difficulties
will
be
avoided
by
the
opposite
shores
remaining
firm
friends
and
allies
the
town
of
niagara
is
a
quaint
looking
place
and
belongs
more
to
the
past
than
the
present
of
canada
for
it
has
not
made
much
progress
since
it
ceased
to
be
the
capital
of
the
upper
province
in
spite
of
its
very
advantageous
and
beautiful
locality
as
you
approach
queenstone
the
river
is
much
contracted
in
its
dimensions
and
its
banks
assume
a
bold
and
lofty
appearance
till
they
frown
down
upon
the
waters
in
stern
and
solemn
grandeur
and
impart
a
wild
romantic
character
to
the
scene
not
often
found
in
the
upper
province
i
never
beheld
any
water
that
resembled
the
deep
green
of
the
niagara
this
may
be
owing
perhaps
to
the
immense
depth
of
the
river
the
colour
of
the
rocks
over
which
it
flows
or
it
may
be
reflected
from
the
beautiful
trees
and
shrubs
that
clothe
its
precipitous
banks
but
it
must
strike
every
person
who
first
gazes
upon
it
as
very
remarkable
you
can
not
look
down
into
it
for
it
is
not
pellucid
but
opaque
in
its
appearance
and
runs
with
a
smooth
surface
more
resembling
oil
than
water
the
waters
of
the
lawrence
are
a
pale
and
so
transparently
clear
that
you
see
through
them
to
a
great
depth
at
sunrise
and
sunset
they
take
all
the
hues
of
the
opal
the
ottawa
is
a
deep
blue
the
otonabee
looks
black
from
the
dark
limestone
bed
over
which
it
foams
and
rushes
our
own
moira
is
of
a
silvery
or
leaden
hue
but
the
waters
of
the
niagara
are
a
bright
deep
green
and
did
any
painter
venture
to
transfer
their
singular
colour
to
his
canvas
it
would
be
considered
extravagant
and
impossible
the
new
suspension
bridge
at
queenstone
is
a
beautiful
object
from
the
water
the
river
here
is
six
hundred
feet
in
width
the
space
between
the
two
stone
towers
that
support
the
bridge
on
either
shore
is
eight
hundred
and
fifty
feet
the
height
above
the
water
two
hundred
feet
the
towers
are
not
built
on
the
top
of
the
bank
but
a
platform
for
each
has
been
quarried
out
of
the
steep
sides
of
the
precipice
about
thirty
feet
below
the
edge
of
the
cliffs
the
road
that
leads
up
from
the
queenstone
ferry
has
been
formed
by
the
same
process
it
is
a
perilous
ascent
and
hangs
almost
over
the
river
nor
is
there
any
sufficient
barrier
to
prevent
a
skittish
horse
from
plunging
from
the
giddy
height
into
the
deep
swift
stream
below
i
should
not
like
to
travel
this
romantic
road
of
a
dark
october
night
even
on
foot
the
queenstone
rattle
up
and
down
this
fearful
path
without
paying
the
least
regard
to
the
nerves
of
their
passengers
at
the
entrance
to
the
bridge
a
space
is
quarried
out
of
the
bank
to
allow
heavy
teams
to
turn
on
to
the
bridge
which
is
done
with
the
greatest
ease
and
safety
several
heavy
loaded
teams
were
crossing
from
the
other
side
and
it
was
curious
to
watch
the
horses
when
they
felt
the
vibratory
motion
draw
back
close
to
the
vehicles
and
take
high
short
steps
as
if
they
apprehended
some
unknown
danger
it
is
surprising
how
well
they
behave
on
this
trying
occasion
for
a
horse
though
a
very
brave
animal
is
one
of
the
most
nervous
ones
in
creation
these
beautiful
structures
are
a
great
triumph
of
mechanical
art
over
a
barrier
which
had
long
been
considered
as
insurmountable
except
by
water
the
ready
mode
of
communication
which
by
their
means
has
been
established
between
the
opposite
shores
must
prove
of
incalculable
advantage
to
this
part
of
the
colony
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
similar
bridges
will
soon
span
the
many
rapid
rivers
in
canada
a
sudden
spring
thaw
gives
such
volume
and
power
to
most
of
the
streams
that
few
bridges
constructed
on
the
old
plan
are
long
able
to
resist
the
impetuosity
of
the
current
but
are
constantly
liable
to
be
carried
away
occasioning
great
damage
in
their
vicinity
the
suspension
bridge
by
being
raised
above
the
possible
action
of
the
water
is
liable
to
none
of
the
casualties
that
operate
against
the
old
bridge
whose
piers
and
arches
though
formed
of
solid
masonry
are
not
proof
against
the
powerful
formed
by
huge
blocks
of
ice
and
heavy
logs
of
wood
aided
by
the
violent
opposing
force
of
the
current
the
light
and
graceful
proportions
of
the
suspension
bridge
add
a
great
charm
to
the
beauty
of
this
charming
landscape
it
is
well
worth
paying
a
visit
to
niagara
if
it
possessed
no
object
of
greater
interest
in
its
neighbourhood
than
these
wonderful
structures
the
village
of
queenstone
is
built
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
is
a
very
pretty
place
numerous
springs
wind
like
silvery
threads
along
the
face
of
the
steep
bank
above
and
wherever
the
waters
find
a
flat
ledge
in
their
downward
course
of
the
finest
quality
grow
in
abundance
the
sparkling
water
gurgling
among
their
juicy
leaves
and
washing
them
to
emerald
brightness
large
portions
of
the
cliff
are
literally
covered
with
them
it
was
no
small
matter
of
surprise
to
me
when
told
that
the
inhabitants
made
no
use
of
this
delicious
plant
but
laugh
at
the
eagerness
with
which
strangers
seek
it
out
the
queenstone
heights
to
the
east
of
the
village
are
a
lofty
ridge
of
land
rising
three
hundred
feet
above
the
level
of
the
country
below
they
are
quite
as
precipitous
as
the
banks
of
the
river
the
railroad
winds
along
the
face
of
this
magnificent
bank
gigantic
trees
tower
far
above
your
head
and
a
beautiful
fertile
country
lies
extended
at
your
feet
there
between
its
rugged
banks
winds
the
glorious
river
and
beyond
forest
and
plain
glitters
the
ontario
against
the
horizon
like
a
mimic
ocean
blending
its
blue
waters
with
the
azure
ocean
of
heaven
truly
it
is
a
magnificent
scene
and
associated
with
the
most
interesting
historical
events
connected
with
the
province
brock
monument
which
you
pass
on
the
road
is
a
melancholy
looking
ruin
but
by
no
means
a
picturesque
one
resembling
some
tall
chimney
that
has
been
left
standing
after
the
house
to
which
it
belonged
had
been
burnt
down
some
time
ago
subscriptions
were
set
on
foot
to
collect
money
to
rebuild
this
monument
but
the
rock
on
which
it
stands
is
after
all
a
more
enduring
monument
to
the
memory
of
the
hero
than
any
perishable
structure
raised
to
commemorate
the
desperate
struggle
that
terminated
on
this
spot
as
long
as
the
heights
of
queenstone
remain
and
the
river
pours
its
swift
current
to
mingle
with
the
ontario
the
name
of
general
brock
will
be
associated
with
the
scene
the
noblest
tablet
on
which
the
deeds
of
a
great
man
can
be
engraved
is
on
the
heart
of
his
grateful
country
were
a
new
monument
erected
on
this
spot
it
is
more
than
probable
that
it
would
share
the
fate
of
its
predecessor
and
some
patriotic
american
would
consider
it
an
act
of
duty
to
the
great
republic
to
dash
it
out
of
from
queenstone
we
took
a
carriage
on
to
niagara
a
distance
of
about
eight
miles
over
good
roads
and
through
a
pleasant
smiling
tract
of
country
this
part
of
the
province
might
justly
be
termed
the
garden
of
canada
and
partakes
more
of
the
soft
and
rich
character
of
english
scenery
the
ground
rises
and
falls
in
gentle
slopes
the
fine
meadows
entirely
free
from
the
odious
black
stumps
are
adorned
with
groups
of
noble
chestnut
and
black
walnut
trees
and
the
peach
and
apple
orchards
in
full
bearing
clustering
around
the
neat
homesteads
give
to
them
an
appearance
of
wealth
and
comfort
which
can
not
exist
for
many
years
to
come
in
more
remote
districts
the
air
on
these
high
is
very
pure
and
elastic
and
i
could
not
help
wishing
for
some
good
fairy
to
remove
my
little
cottage
into
one
of
the
fair
enclosures
we
passed
continually
by
the
roadside
and
place
it
beneath
the
shade
of
some
of
the
beautiful
trees
that
adorned
every
field
here
for
the
first
time
in
canada
i
observed
hedges
of
the
canadian
thorn
a
great
improvement
on
the
old
snake
fence
of
rough
split
timber
which
prevails
all
through
the
colony
what
a
difference
it
would
make
in
the
aspect
of
the
country
if
these
green
hedgerows
were
in
general
use
it
would
take
from
the
savage
barrenness
given
to
it
by
these
crooked
wooden
lines
that
cross
and
recross
the
country
in
all
directions
no
object
can
be
less
picturesque
or
more
unpleasing
to
the
eye
a
new
clearing
reminds
one
of
a
large
turnip
field
divided
by
hurdles
into
different
compartments
for
the
feeding
of
sheep
and
cattle
often
for
miles
on
a
stretch
there
is
scarcely
a
tree
or
bush
to
relieve
the
blank
monotony
of
these
ugly
uncouth
partitions
of
land
beyond
charred
stumps
and
rank
weeds
and
the
uniform
belt
of
forest
at
the
back
of
the
new
fields
the
canadian
cuts
down
but
rarely
plants
trees
which
circumstance
accounts
for
the
blank
look
of
desolation
that
pervades
all
new
settlements
a
few
young
maples
and
rock
elms
planted
along
the
roadsides
would
at
a
very
small
expense
of
labour
in
a
very
few
years
remedy
this
ugly
feature
in
the
canadian
landscape
and
afford
a
grateful
shade
to
the
weary
traveller
from
the
scorching
heat
of
the
summer
sun
in
old
countries
where
landed
property
often
remains
for
ages
in
the
same
family
the
present
occupant
plants
and
improves
for
future
generations
hoping
that
his
son
sons
may
enjoy
the
fruit
of
his
labours
but
in
a
new
country
like
this
where
property
is
constantly
changing
owners
no
one
seems
to
think
it
worth
their
while
to
take
any
trouble
to
add
to
the
beauty
of
a
place
for
the
benefit
of
strangers
most
of
our
second
growth
of
trees
have
been
planted
by
the
beautiful
hand
of
nature
who
in
laying
out
her
cunning
work
generally
does
it
in
the
most
advantageous
manner
and
chance
or
accident
has
suffered
the
trees
to
remain
on
the
spot
from
whence
they
sprung
trees
that
grow
in
open
spaces
after
the
forest
has
been
cleared
away
are
as
graceful
and
umbrageous
as
those
planted
in
parks
at
home
the
forest
trees
seldom
possess
any
great
beauty
of
outline
they
run
all
to
top
and
throw
out
few
lateral
branches
there
is
not
a
tree
in
the
woods
that
could
afford
the
least
shelter
during
a
smart
shower
of
rain
they
are
so
closely
packed
together
in
these
dense
forests
that
a
very
small
amount
of
foliage
for
the
size
and
length
of
the
trunk
is
to
be
found
on
any
individual
tree
one
wood
is
the
exact
picture
of
another
the
uniformity
dreary
in
the
extreme
there
are
no
green
vistas
to
be
seen
no
grassy
glades
beneath
the
bosky
oaks
on
which
the
deer
browse
and
the
gigantic
shadows
sleep
in
the
sunbeams
a
stern
array
of
rugged
trunks
a
tangled
maze
of
scrubby
underbrush
carpetted
winter
and
summer
with
a
thick
layer
of
withered
buff
leaves
form
the
general
features
of
a
canadian
forest
a
few
flowers
force
their
heads
through
this
thick
covering
of
leaves
and
make
glad
with
their
beauty
the
desolate
wilderness
but
those
who
look
for
an
arcadia
of
fruits
and
flowers
in
the
backwoods
of
canada
can
not
fail
of
disappointment
some
localities
it
is
true
are
more
favoured
than
others
especially
those
sandy
tracts
of
that
are
called
plains
in
this
country
the
trees
are
more
scattered
and
the
ground
receives
the
benefit
of
light
and
sunshine
flowers
those
precious
gifts
of
god
do
not
delight
in
darkness
and
shade
and
this
is
one
great
reason
why
they
are
so
scarce
in
the
woods
i
saw
more
beautiful
blossoms
waving
above
the
niagara
river
from
every
crevice
in
its
rocky
banks
than
i
over
beheld
during
my
long
residence
in
the
bush
these
lovely
children
of
light
seem
peculiarly
to
rejoice
in
their
near
vicinity
to
water
the
open
space
allowed
to
the
wide
rivers
affording
them
the
air
and
sunshine
denied
to
them
in
the
close
atmosphere
of
the
dense
woods
the
first
sight
we
caught
of
the
falls
of
niagara
was
from
the
top
of
the
hill
that
leads
directly
into
the
village
i
had
been
intently
examining
the
rare
shrubs
and
beautiful
flowers
that
grew
in
an
exquisite
garden
surrounding
a
very
fine
mansion
on
my
right
hand
perfectly
astonished
at
their
luxuriance
and
the
emerald
greenness
of
the
turf
at
that
season
which
had
been
one
of
unprecedented
drought
when
on
raising
my
head
the
great
cataract
burst
on
my
sight
without
any
intervening
screen
producing
an
overwhelming
sensation
in
my
mind
which
amounted
to
pain
in
its
intensity
yes
the
great
object
of
my
journey
one
of
the
fondest
anticipations
of
my
life
was
at
length
accomplished
and
for
a
moment
the
blood
recoiled
back
to
my
heart
and
a
tremulous
thrill
ran
through
my
whole
frame
i
was
so
bewildered
so
taken
by
surprise
that
every
feeling
was
absorbed
in
the
one
consciousness
that
the
sublime
vision
was
before
me
that
i
had
at
last
seen
niagara
that
it
was
now
mine
forever
stereotyped
upon
my
heart
by
the
unerring
hand
of
nature
producing
an
impression
which
nothing
but
madness
or
idiotcy
could
efface
it
was
some
seconds
before
i
could
collect
my
thoughts
or
concentrate
my
attention
sufficiently
to
identify
one
of
its
gigantic
features
the
eye
crowds
all
into
the
one
glance
and
the
eager
mind
is
too
much
dazzled
and
intoxicated
for
minor
details
astonishment
and
admiration
are
succeeded
by
curious
examination
and
enjoyment
but
it
is
impossible
to
realize
this
at
first
the
tumultuous
rush
of
feeling
the
excitement
occasioned
by
the
grand
spectacle
must
subside
before
you
can
draw
a
free
breath
and
have
time
for
thought
the
american
fall
was
directly
opposite
resembling
a
vast
rolling
cylinder
of
light
flashing
through
clouds
of
silvery
mist
and
casting
from
it
long
rays
of
indescribable
brightness
i
never
could
realize
in
this
perfect
image
of
a
living
and
perpetual
motion
a
of
waters
it
always
had
to
my
eyes
this
majestic
solemn
rotatory
movement
when
seen
from
the
bank
above
the
fall
is
further
on
to
the
right
and
you
only
get
a
side
view
of
it
from
this
point
the
falls
are
seen
to
the
least
possible
advantage
from
the
brow
of
the
steep
bank
in
looking
down
upon
them
you
can
form
no
adequate
idea
of
their
volume
height
and
grandeur
yet
that
first
glance
can
never
be
effaced
you
feel
a
thrilling
triumphant
joy
whilst
contemplating
this
of
nature
this
sublime
idea
of
the
eternal
this
wonderful
symbol
of
the
power
and
strength
of
the
divine
architect
of
the
universe
it
is
as
if
the
great
heart
of
nature
were
laid
bare
before
you
and
you
saw
and
heard
all
its
gigantic
throbbings
and
watched
the
current
of
its
stupendous
life
flowing
perpetually
forward
i
can
not
imagine
how
any
one
could
be
disappointed
in
this
august
scene
and
the
singular
indifference
manifested
by
others
it
is
either
a
miserable
affectation
of
singularity
or
a
lamentable
want
of
sensibility
to
the
grand
and
beautiful
the
human
being
who
could
stand
unmoved
before
the
great
cataract
and
feel
no
quickening
of
the
pulse
no
silent
adoration
of
the
heart
towards
the
creator
of
this
wondrous
scene
would
remain
as
indifferent
and
as
uninspired
before
the
throne
of
god
throwing
out
of
the
question
the
romantic
locality
the
rugged
wooded
banks
the
vast
blocks
of
stone
scattered
at
the
edge
of
the
torrent
the
magic
colour
of
the
waters
the
overhanging
crags
the
wild
flowers
waving
from
the
steep
the
glorious
hues
of
the
rainbow
that
spans
the
river
and
that
soft
cloud
of
silvery
brightness
for
ever
flowing
upward
into
the
clear
air
like
the
prayer
of
faith
ascending
from
earth
to
heaven
the
enormous
magnitude
of
the
waters
alone
their
curbless
power
and
eternal
motion
are
sufficient
to
give
rise
to
feelings
of
astonishment
and
admiration
such
as
never
were
experienced
before
not
the
least
of
these
sensations
is
created
by
the
deep
roar
of
the
falling
torrent
that
shakes
the
solid
rocks
beneath
your
feet
and
is
repeated
by
the
thousand
hidden
echoes
among
those
stern
craggy
heights
it
is
impossible
for
language
to
convey
any
adequate
idea
of
the
grandeur
of
the
falls
when
seen
from
below
either
from
the
deck
of
the
maid
of
the
mist
the
small
steamer
that
approaches
within
a
few
yards
of
the
descending
sheet
of
the
falls
or
from
the
ferry
boat
that
plies
continually
between
the
opposite
shores
from
the
frail
little
boat
dancing
like
a
feather
upon
the
green
swelling
surges
you
perhaps
form
the
best
notion
of
the
vastness
and
magnitude
of
the
descending
waters
and
of
your
own
helplessness
and
insignificance
they
flow
down
upon
your
vision
like
moving
mountains
of
light
and
the
shadowy
outline
of
black
rocks
dimly
seen
through
clouds
of
driving
mist
adds
a
wild
sublimity
to
the
scene
while
the
boat
struggles
over
the
curling
billows
at
times
lifted
up
by
the
from
below
the
feeling
of
danger
and
insecurity
is
lost
in
the
whirl
of
waters
that
surround
you
the
mind
expands
with
the
scene
and
you
rejoice
in
the
terrific
power
that
threatens
to
annihilate
you
and
your
fairy
bark
a
visible
presence
of
the
majesty
of
god
is
before
you
and
sheltered
by
his
protecting
hand
you
behold
the
glorious
spectacle
and
live
the
dark
forests
of
pine
that
form
the
background
to
the
falls
when
seen
from
above
are
entirely
lost
from
the
surface
of
the
river
and
the
descending
floods
seem
to
pour
down
upon
you
from
the
skies
the
day
had
turned
out
as
beautiful
as
heart
could
wish
and
though
i
felt
very
much
fatigued
with
the
journey
i
determined
to
set
all
aches
and
pains
at
defiance
whilst
i
remained
on
this
enchanted
ground
we
had
just
time
enough
to
spare
before
dinner
to
walk
to
the
table
rock
following
the
road
along
the
brow
of
the
steep
bank
on
the
way
we
called
in
at
the
curiosity
shop
kept
by
an
old
man
who
had
made
for
himself
a
snug
little
california
by
turning
all
he
touched
into
gold
his
consisting
of
geological
specimens
from
the
vicinity
of
the
falls
pebbles
plants
stuffed
birds
beasts
and
sticks
cut
from
the
timber
that
grows
along
the
rocky
banks
and
twisted
into
every
imaginable
shape
the
heads
of
these
canes
were
dexterously
carved
to
imitate
snakes
snapping
turtles
eagles
heads
and
indian
faces
here
the
fantastic
ends
of
the
roots
of
shrubs
from
which
they
were
made
were
cut
into
a
grotesque
triumvirate
of
legs
and
feet
here
a
black
snake
spotted
and
coloured
to
represent
the
horrid
reptile
made
you
fancy
its
ugly
coils
already
twisting
in
abhorrent
folds
about
your
hands
and
arms
there
was
no
end
to
the
old
man
imaginative
freaks
in
this
department
his
wares
bearing
a
proportionate
price
to
the
dignity
of
the
location
from
which
they
were
derived
a
vast
amount
of
indian
toys
and
articles
of
dress
made
the
museum
quite
gay
with
their
tawdry
ornaments
of
beads
and
feathers
it
is
a
pleasant
lounging
place
and
the
old
man
forms
one
of
its
chief
attractions
proceeding
on
to
the
table
rock
we
passed
many
beautiful
gardens
all
bearing
the
same
rich
tint
of
verdure
and
glowing
with
fruit
and
flowers
the
showers
of
spray
rising
from
the
vast
natural
fountain
in
their
neighbourhood
fill
the
air
with
cool
and
refreshing
moisture
which
waters
these
lovely
gardens
as
the
mists
did
of
yore
that
went
up
from
the
face
of
the
earth
to
water
the
garden
of
eden
the
fall
is
much
lower
than
its
twin
cataract
on
the
american
side
but
what
it
loses
in
height
it
makes
up
in
power
and
volume
and
the
amount
of
water
that
is
constantly
discharged
over
it
as
we
approached
the
table
rock
a
rainbow
of
splendid
dyes
spanned
the
river
rising
from
out
the
driving
mist
from
the
american
fall
until
it
melted
into
the
leaping
snowy
foam
of
the
great
canadian
cataract
there
is
a
strange
blending
in
this
scene
of
beauty
and
softness
with
the
magnificent
and
the
sublime
a
deep
sonorous
music
in
the
thundering
of
the
mighty
floods
as
if
the
spirits
of
earth
and
air
united
in
one
solemn
choral
chant
of
praise
to
the
creator
the
rocks
vibrate
to
the
living
harmony
and
the
shores
around
seem
hurrying
forward
as
if
impelled
by
the
force
of
the
descending
torrent
of
sound
yet
within
a
few
yards
of
all
this
whirlpool
of
conflicting
elements
the
river
glides
onward
as
peacefully
and
gently
as
if
it
had
not
received
into
its
mysterious
depths
this
avalanche
of
foaming
waters
here
you
enjoy
a
splendid
view
of
the
rapids
raising
your
eyes
from
the
green
glassy
edge
of
the
falls
you
see
the
mad
hubbub
of
boiling
waves
rushing
with
headlong
fury
down
the
watery
steep
to
take
their
final
plunge
into
the
abyss
below
on
on
they
come
that
phalanx
of
waves
pouring
and
crowding
upon
each
other
in
frantic
chase
things
of
life
and
light
and
motion
spirits
of
the
unfathom
ocean
hurrying
on
with
curbless
force
like
some
rash
unbridled
horse
high
in
air
their
white
crests
flinging
and
madly
to
destruction
springing
these
boiling
breakers
seem
to
shout
and
revel
in
a
wild
ecstasy
of
freedom
and
power
and
you
feel
inclined
to
echo
their
shout
and
rejoice
with
them
yet
it
is
curious
to
mark
how
they
slacken
their
mad
speed
when
they
reach
the
ledge
of
the
fall
and
melt
into
the
icy
smoothness
of
its
polished
brow
as
if
conscious
of
the
superior
force
that
is
destined
to
annihilate
their
identity
and
dash
them
into
mist
and
spray
in
like
manner
the
waves
of
life
are
hurried
into
the
abyss
of
death
and
absorbed
in
the
vast
ocean
of
eternity
niagara
would
be
shorn
of
half
its
wonders
divested
of
these
glorious
rapids
which
form
one
of
the
grandest
features
in
the
magnificent
scene
we
returned
to
our
inn
the
clifton
house
just
in
time
to
save
our
dinner
having
taken
breakfast
in
toronto
at
six
we
were
quite
ready
to
obey
the
noisy
summons
of
the
bell
and
follow
our
sable
guide
into
the
eating
room
the
clifton
house
is
a
large
handsome
building
directly
fronting
the
falls
it
is
fitted
up
in
a
very
superior
style
and
contains
ample
accommodations
for
a
great
number
of
visitors
it
had
been
very
full
during
the
summer
months
but
a
great
many
persons
had
left
during
the
preceding
week
which
i
considered
a
very
fortunate
circumstance
for
those
who
like
myself
came
to
see
instead
of
to
be
seen
the
charges
for
a
canadian
hotel
are
high
but
of
course
you
are
expected
to
pay
something
extra
at
a
place
of
such
general
resort
and
for
the
grand
view
of
the
falls
which
can
be
enjoyed
at
any
moment
by
stepping
into
the
handsome
balcony
into
which
the
saloon
opens
and
which
runs
the
whole
length
of
the
side
and
front
of
the
house
the
former
commands
a
full
view
of
the
american
the
latter
of
the
fall
and
the
high
french
windows
of
this
elegantly
furnished
apartment
give
you
the
opportunity
of
enjoying
both
you
pay
four
dollars
for
your
board
and
bed
this
does
not
include
wine
and
every
little
extra
is
an
additional
charge
children
and
servants
are
rated
at
and
a
baby
is
charged
a
dollar
this
item
in
the
family
programme
is
something
new
in
the
bill
of
charges
at
an
hotel
in
this
country
for
these
small
gentry
though
they
give
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
their
lawful
owners
are
always
entertained
gratis
at
inns
and
on
board
steamboats
the
room
in
which
dinner
was
served
could
have
accommodated
with
ease
treble
the
number
of
guests
a
large
party
chiefly
americans
sat
down
to
table
the
dishes
are
not
served
on
the
table
a
bill
of
fare
is
laid
by
every
plate
and
you
call
for
what
you
please
this
arrangement
which
saves
a
deal
of
trouble
seemed
very
distasteful
to
a
gentleman
near
us
to
whom
the
sight
of
good
cheer
must
have
been
almost
as
pleasant
as
eating
it
for
he
muttered
half
aloud
that
he
hated
these
ways
that
he
liked
to
see
what
he
was
going
to
eat
that
he
did
not
choose
to
be
put
off
with
kickshaws
that
he
did
not
understand
the
french
names
for
dishes
he
was
not
french
and
he
thought
that
they
might
be
written
in
plain
english
i
was
very
much
of
the
same
opinion
and
found
myself
nearly
in
the
same
predicament
with
the
grumbler
at
my
left
hand
but
i
did
not
betray
my
ignorance
by
venturing
a
remark
this
brought
forcibly
to
my
mind
a
story
that
had
recently
been
told
me
by
a
dear
primitive
old
lady
a
daughter
of
one
of
the
first
dutch
settlers
in
the
upper
province
over
which
i
had
laughed
very
heartily
at
the
time
and
now
it
served
as
an
illustration
of
my
own
case
you
know
my
dear
said
old
c
that
i
went
lately
to
new
york
to
visit
a
nephew
of
mine
whom
i
had
not
seen
from
a
boy
well
he
has
grown
a
very
great
man
since
those
days
and
is
now
one
of
the
wealthiest
merchants
in
the
city
i
never
had
been
inside
such
a
grandly
furnished
house
before
we
know
nothing
of
the
great
world
in
canada
or
how
the
rich
people
live
in
such
a
place
as
new
york
ours
are
all
bread
and
butter
doings
when
compared
with
their
grand
fixings
i
saw
and
heard
a
great
many
things
such
as
i
never
dreamed
of
before
and
which
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
understand
but
i
never
let
on
one
morning
at
luncheon
my
nephew
says
to
me
c
you
have
never
tasted
our
new
york
cider
i
will
order
up
some
on
purpose
to
see
how
you
like
it
the
servant
brought
up
several
bottles
on
a
real
silver
tray
and
placed
them
on
the
table
lord
thinks
i
are
queer
looking
cider
bottles
it
champagne
and
he
wants
to
get
up
a
laugh
against
me
before
all
these
strange
people
i
had
never
seen
or
tasted
champagne
in
all
my
life
though
there
lots
of
it
sold
in
canada
and
our
head
folks
give
champagne
breakfasts
and
champagne
dinners
but
i
had
heard
how
it
acted
and
how
when
you
drew
the
corks
from
the
bottles
they
went
pop
pop
so
i
just
listened
a
bit
and
held
my
tongue
and
the
first
bounce
it
gave
i
cried
out
r
you
may
call
that
cider
in
new
york
but
we
call
it
champagne
in
canada
you
get
champagne
in
canada
aunty
says
he
stopping
and
looking
me
straight
in
the
face
do
we
says
i
it
a
great
deal
better
than
your
york
he
looked
mortified
i
tell
you
and
the
company
all
laughed
and
i
drank
off
my
glass
of
champagne
as
bold
as
you
please
as
if
i
had
been
used
to
it
all
my
life
when
you
are
away
from
home
and
find
yourself
ignorant
of
a
thing
or
two
never
let
others
into
the
secret
watch
and
wait
and
you
find
it
out
by
and
by
not
having
been
used
to
french
dishes
during
my
long
sojourn
in
canada
i
was
glad
to
take
the
old
lady
advice
and
make
use
of
my
eyes
and
ears
before
i
ordered
my
own
supplies
it
would
have
done
stowe
heart
good
to
have
seen
the
fine
corps
of
negro
waiters
who
served
the
tables
most
of
whom
were
runaway
slaves
from
the
states
the
perfect
ease
and
dexterity
with
which
they
supplied
the
guests
without
making
a
single
mistake
out
of
such
a
variety
of
dishes
was
well
worthy
of
notice
it
gave
me
pleasure
to
watch
the
quickness
of
all
their
motions
the
politeness
with
which
they
received
so
many
complicated
orders
and
the
noiseless
celerity
with
which
they
were
performed
this
cost
them
no
effort
but
seemed
natural
to
them
there
were
a
dozen
of
these
blacks
in
attendance
all
of
them
young
and
some
in
spite
of
their
dark
colouring
handsome
intelligent
looking
men
the
master
of
the
hotel
was
eloquent
in
their
praise
and
said
that
they
far
surpassed
the
whites
in
the
neat
and
elegant
manner
in
which
they
laid
out
a
table
that
he
scarcely
knew
what
he
would
do
without
them
i
found
myself
guilty
of
violating
lord
chesterfield
rules
of
politeness
while
watching
a
group
of
eaters
who
sat
opposite
to
me
at
table
the
celerity
with
which
they
despatched
their
dinner
and
yet
contrived
to
taste
of
everything
contained
in
the
bill
of
fare
was
really
wonderful
to
them
it
was
a
serious
matter
of
business
they
never
lifted
their
eyes
from
their
plates
or
spoke
a
word
beyond
ordering
fresh
supplies
during
feeding
time
one
lady
in
particular
attracted
my
notice
for
she
did
more
justice
to
the
creature
comforts
than
all
the
rest
the
last
course
including
the
dessert
was
served
at
table
and
she
helped
herself
to
such
quantities
of
pudding
pie
preserves
custard
ice
and
fruit
that
such
a
medley
of
rich
things
i
never
before
saw
heaped
upon
one
plate
some
of
these
articles
she
never
tasted
but
she
seemed
determined
to
secure
to
herself
a
portion
of
all
and
to
get
as
much
as
she
could
for
her
money
i
wish
nature
had
not
given
me
such
a
quick
perception
of
the
ridiculous
such
a
perverse
inclination
to
laugh
in
the
wrong
place
for
though
one
can
not
help
deriving
from
it
a
wicked
enjoyment
it
is
a
very
troublesome
gift
and
very
difficult
to
conceal
so
i
turned
my
face
resolutely
from
contemplating
the
doings
of
the
lady
and
entered
into
conversation
with
an
old
gentleman
from
the
states
a
yankee
whom
i
found
a
very
agreeable
and
intelligent
companion
willing
to
exchange
with
manly
independent
courtesy
the
treasures
of
his
own
mind
with
another
and
i
listened
to
his
account
of
american
schools
and
public
institutions
with
great
interest
his
party
consisted
of
a
young
and
very
delicate
looking
lady
and
a
smart
active
little
boy
of
five
years
of
age
these
i
concluded
were
his
daughter
and
grandson
from
the
striking
likeness
that
existed
between
the
child
and
the
old
man
the
lady
he
said
was
in
bad
health
the
boy
was
hearty
and
after
dinner
the
company
separated
some
to
visit
objects
of
interest
in
the
neighbourhood
others
to
the
saloon
and
the
balcony
i
preferred
a
seat
in
the
latter
and
ensconcing
myself
in
the
depths
of
a
large
comfortable
rocking
chair
which
was
placed
fronting
the
falls
i
gave
up
my
whole
heart
and
soul
to
the
contemplation
of
their
glorious
beauty
i
was
roused
from
a
state
almost
bordering
on
idolatry
by
a
lady
remarking
to
another
who
was
standing
beside
her
that
she
considered
the
falls
a
great
humbug
that
there
was
more
fuss
made
about
them
than
they
deserved
that
she
was
satisfied
with
having
seen
them
once
and
that
she
never
wished
to
see
them
again
i
was
not
the
least
surprised
on
turning
my
head
to
behold
in
the
speaker
the
lady
a
gentleman
to
whom
i
told
these
remarks
laughed
that
reminds
me
of
a
miller
wife
who
came
from
black
rock
near
buffalo
last
summer
to
see
the
falls
after
standing
here
and
looking
at
them
for
some
minutes
she
drawled
through
her
nose
i
declare
is
that
all
and
have
i
come
eighteen
miles
to
look
at
you
i
might
spared
myself
the
expense
and
trouble
my
husband
is
as
good
a
sight
only
it
not
just
as
this
lady
would
certainly
have
echoed
the
sublime
sentiment
expressed
by
our
friend
the
poet
oh
what
a
glorious
place
for
washing
sheep
niagara
would
be
in
the
evening
my
husband
hired
a
cab
and
we
drove
to
see
the
upper
suspension
bridge
the
road
our
driver
took
was
very
narrow
and
close
to
the
edge
of
the
frightful
precipice
that
forms
at
this
place
the
bank
of
the
river
which
runs
more
than
two
hundred
feet
below
the
cabman
we
soon
discovered
was
not
a
member
of
the
temperance
society
he
was
very
much
intoxicated
and
like
jehu
the
son
of
nimshi
he
drove
furiously
i
felt
very
timid
and
nervous
sickness
makes
us
sad
cowards
and
what
the
mind
enjoys
in
health
becomes
an
object
of
fear
when
it
is
enfeebled
and
unstrung
by
bodily
weakness
my
dear
husband
guessed
my
feelings
and
placed
himself
in
such
a
manner
as
to
hide
from
my
sight
the
danger
to
which
we
were
exposed
by
our
careless
driver
in
spite
of
the
many
picturesque
beauties
in
our
road
i
felt
greatly
relieved
when
we
drove
up
to
the
bridge
and
our
short
journey
was
accomplished
the
suspension
bridge
on
which
we
now
stood
surveying
from
its
dizzy
height
two
hundred
and
thirty
feet
above
the
water
the
stream
below
seems
to
demand
from
us
a
greater
amount
of
interest
than
the
one
at
queenstone
from
the
fact
of
its
having
been
the
first
experiment
of
the
kind
ever
made
in
this
country
a
grand
and
successful
effort
of
mechanical
genius
over
obstacles
that
appeared
insurmountable
the
river
is
two
hundred
feet
wider
here
than
at
queenstone
and
the
bridge
is
of
much
larger
dimensions
the
height
of
the
stone
tower
that
supports
it
on
the
american
side
is
feet
and
of
the
wooden
tower
on
the
canadian
shore
fifty
feet
the
number
of
cables
for
the
bridge
is
sixteen
of
strands
in
each
cable
six
hundred
of
strands
in
the
the
diameter
of
which
is
of
an
inch
the
ultimate
tension
is
six
thousand
five
hundred
tons
and
the
capacity
of
the
bridge
five
hundred
a
passage
across
is
thrillingly
exciting
the
depth
of
the
river
below
the
bridge
is
two
hundred
and
fifty
feet
and
the
water
partakes
more
largely
of
that
singular
deep
green
at
this
spot
than
i
had
remarked
elsewhere
the
american
stage
crossed
the
bridge
as
we
were
leaving
it
and
the
horses
seemed
to
feel
the
same
mysterious
dread
which
i
have
before
described
a
great
number
of
strong
wooden
posts
that
support
the
towers
take
greatly
from
the
elegance
of
this
bridge
but
i
am
told
that
these
will
shortly
be
removed
and
their
place
supplied
by
a
stone
tower
and
buttresses
we
returned
by
another
and
less
dangerous
route
to
the
clifton
house
just
in
time
to
witness
a
glorious
autumnal
sunset
the
west
was
a
flood
of
molten
gold
fretted
with
crimson
clouds
the
great
fall
caught
every
tint
of
the
glowing
heavens
and
looked
like
a
vast
sheet
of
flame
the
mist
rising
from
it
like
a
wreath
of
red
and
smoke
this
gorgeous
sight
contrasted
by
the
dark
pine
woods
and
frowning
cliffs
which
were
thrown
into
deep
shade
presented
a
spectacle
of
such
surpassing
beauty
and
grandeur
that
it
could
only
be
appreciated
by
those
who
witnessed
it
any
attempt
to
describe
it
must
prove
a
failure
i
stood
chained
to
the
spot
mute
with
admiration
till
the
sun
set
behind
the
trees
and
the
last
rays
of
light
faded
from
the
horizon
and
still
the
thought
uppermost
in
my
mind
was
who
could
feel
disappointed
at
a
scene
like
this
can
the
wide
world
supply
such
another
the
removal
of
all
the
ugly
mills
along
its
shores
would
improve
it
perhaps
and
add
the
one
charm
it
wants
by
being
hemmed
in
by
tasteless
buildings
the
sublimity
of
solitude
oh
for
one
hour
alone
with
nature
and
her
great
niagara
what
solemn
converse
would
the
soul
hold
with
its
creator
at
such
a
shrine
and
the
busy
hum
of
practical
life
would
not
mar
with
its
jarring
discord
this
grand
thunder
of
the
waters
realities
are
unmanageable
things
in
some
hands
and
the
americans
are
gravely
contemplating
making
their
sublime
fall
into
a
motive
power
for
turning
machinery
ye
gods
what
next
will
the
love
of
gain
suggest
to
these
the
whole
earth
should
enter
into
a
protest
against
such
an
act
of
sacrilege
such
a
shameless
desecration
of
one
of
the
noblest
works
of
god
niagara
belongs
to
no
particular
nation
or
people
it
is
an
inheritance
bequeathed
by
the
great
author
to
all
mankind
an
altar
raised
by
his
own
almighty
hand
at
which
all
true
worshippers
must
bow
the
knee
in
solemn
adoration
i
trust
that
these
free
glad
waters
will
assert
their
own
rights
and
dash
into
mist
and
spray
any
attempt
made
to
infringe
their
glorious
liberty
but
the
bell
is
ringing
for
tea
and
i
must
smother
my
indignation
with
the
reflection
that
sufficient
for
the
day
is
the
evil
thereof
a
freak
of
fancy
i
had
a
dream
of
ocean
in
stern
and
stormy
pride
with
terrible
commotion
dark
thundering
came
the
tide
high
on
the
groaning

the
roar
of
the
angry
echoing

the

the
furious
surges
boiling
roll
mountains
in
their
path
beneath
their
white
hoofs
coiling
they
spurn
them
in
their
wrath
the
moon
at
full
was
streaming
through
rack
and
like
the
last
pale
taper
gleaming
on
coffin
pall
and
shroud
the
winds
were
fiercely
wreaking
their
vengeance
on
the
wave
a
hoarse
dirge
wildly
shrieking
each
uncoffin
grave
i
started
from
my
pillow
the
moon
was
riding
high
the
wind
scarce
heav
a
billow
beneath
that
cloudless
sky
i
look
from
earth
to
heaven
and
bless
the
tranquil
beam
my
trembling
heart

the
tempest

the

with
the
ringlets
was
absent
with
her
party
from
the
i
was
not
sorry
to
learn
that
she
was
gone
i
had
conceived
a
prejudice
against
her
from
the
remark
i
heard
her
make
about
the
falls
her
gustativeness
predominated
so
largely
over
her
ideality
that
she
reminded
me
of
a
young
lady
who
after
describing
to
me
a
supper
of
which
by
her
own
account
she
had
largely
partaken
said
with
a
candour
almost
shocking
in
its
simplicity
to
tell
you
the
plain
truth
my
dear
m
my
art
she
was
english
and
cockney
and
dreadfully
mangled
the
letter
whenever
it
stumbled
into
a
speech
is
in
my
the
cup
of
excellent
tea
was
most
refreshing
after
the
fatigues
of
the
day
and
while
enjoying
it
i
got
into
an
agreeable
chat
with
several
pleasant
people
but
we
were
all
strangers
even
in
name
to
each
other
the
night
was
misty
and
intensely
dark
without
moon
or
stars
how
i
longed
for
one
glimpse
of
the
former
to
shed
if
only
a
wandering
gleam
upon
the
falls
the
awful
music
of
their
continuous
roar
filled
the
heavens
and
jarred
the
windows
of
the
building
with
the
tremulous
motion
we
feel
on
board
a
and
then
i
amused
myself
with
picturing
them
during
one
of
our
desolating
thunderstorms
leaping
into
existence
out
of
the
dense
darkness
when
revealed
by
the
broad
red
flashes
of
lightning
and
i
wished
that
my
limited
means
would
allow
me
to
remain
long
enough
in
their
vicinity
to
see
them
under
every
change
of
season
and
weather
but
it
was
not
to
be
and
after
peering
long
and
anxiously
into
the
dark
night
i
retreated
to
an
unoccupied
sofa
in
a
distant
part
of
the
saloon
to
watch
and
listen
to
all
that
was
passing
around
me
two
young
american
ladies
not
of
a
highly
educated
class
were
engaged
in
a
lively
conversation
with
two
dashing
english
officers
who
for
their
own
amusement
were
practising
upon
their
credulity
and
flattering
their
national
prejudices
with
the
most
depreciating
remarks
on
england
and
the
english
people
i
am
english
cried
number
one
but
i
am
no
great
admirer
of
her
people
and
institutions
the
americans
beat
them
hollow
all
the
world
think
so
but
themselves
said
the
younger
lady
they
are
such
a
vain
arrogant
set
decidedly
so
the
men
are
bad
enough
but
the
women
i
dare
say
you
have
heard
them
called
handsome
ah
yes
in
a
very
lively
tone
but
i
never
believed
it
i
never
in
my
life
saw
a
pretty
english
woman
among
all
that
i
have
seen
in
new
york
to
my
thinking
they
are
a
sad
set
of
frights
stiff
formal
and
repulsive
they
dress
in
shocking
bad
taste
and
consider
themselves
and
their
uncouth
fashions
as
the
standards
of
perfection
my
dear
madam
you
are
right
they
are
odious
creatures
the
beauty
for
which
they
were
once
renowned
has
vanished
with
the
last
generation
our
modern
english
girls
are
decided
barbarians
it
is
impossible
to
meet
with
a
pretty
english
woman
i
have
made
a
vow
to
cut
them
altogether
and
if
ever
i
commit
such
a
foolish
thing
as
matrimony
to
take
to
myself
an
wife
are
you
in
earnest
with
a
very
fascinating
smile
and
flashing
upon
him
her
fine
dark
eyes
quite
so
but
now
you
must
not
take
me
for
a
rich
english
coelebs
in
search
of
a
wife
i
am
an
unfortunate
scapegrace
have
run
out
all
my
means
and
am
not
worth
a
york
shilling
to
jingle
on
a
tombstone
i
was
obliged
to
borrow
money
of
my
landlord
he
a
capital
fellow
to
pay
my
washerwoman
bill
this
morning
so
do
fall
in
love
with
me
i
assure
you
on
my
honour
it
would
be
a
bad
spec
do
be
alarmed
returned
the
girl
evidently
much
pleased
with
her
odd
companion
are
you
very
young
i
was
never
young
my
mother
told
me
that
i
had
cut
my
when
i
was
born
i
was
wide
awake
too
like
your
clever
people
and
have
kept
my
eyes
open
ever
since
you
have
seen
a
great
deal
of
the
world
yes
too
much
of
it
but
is
a
tolerable
world
to
live
in
after
all
were
you
ever
in
the
united
states
only
crossed
from
the
other
side
a
few
days
ago
did
you
not
notice
the
arrival
of
p
among
the
list
of
distinguished
foreigners
that
honoured
your
great
city
with
their
presence
and
what
struck
you
most
when
you
got
there
oh
the
beauty
and
elegance
of
the
women
of
course
you
flatter
us
fact
upon
honour
with
a
quizzical
application
of
his
hand
to
his
heart
what
did
you
admire
in
them
their
straight
up
and
down
figures
they
have
no
vulgar
redundancies
no
red
cheeks
and
pug
noses
and
then
their
voices
are
so
sweet
and
harmonious
their
pronunciation
so
correct
so
every
way
superior
to
the
boisterous
hearty
frankness
of
our
british
girls
english
women
have
very
bad
noses
i
have
remarked
that
and
they
are
so
horribly
fat
and
they
laugh
so
loud
and
talk
in
such
a
high
key
my
i
often
wondered
where
they
learned
their
manners
oh
is
all
natural
to
them
it
comes
to
them
without
teaching
i
have
been
told
that
london
is
a
shocking
place
dreadful
and
the
climate
is
disgusting
it
rains
there
every
day
and
fogs
are
so
prevalent
that
during
the
winter
months
they
burn
candles
all
day
to
see
to
eat
as
to
the
sun
he
never
comes
out
but
once
or
twice
during
the
summer
just
to
let
us
know
that
he
has
not
been
struck
out
of
creation
and
the
streets
my
dear
young
lady
are
so
filthy
that
the
women
have
to
wear
pattens
in
their
carriages
you
do
say
just
to
keep
their
petticoats
out
of
the
mud
which
is
so
deep
that
it
penetrates
through
the
bottom
of
the
carriages
i
never
will
go
to
england
i
declare
you
will
be
better
appreciated
in
your
free
and
glorious
country
slavery
thrives
there
and
you
make
slaves
of
us
poor
men
now
do
stop
there
and
have
done
with
your
blarney
blarney
i
not
irish
englishmen
always
speak
the
truth
when
talking
to
the
ladies
here
he
paused
quite
out
of
breath
and
his
companion
in
mischief
commenced
with
the
other
lady
who
is
that
tall
stout
handsome
man
with
the
fat
lady
on
his
arm
who
has
just
entered
the
room
that
an
american
from
the
south
he
worth
his
weight
in
gold
and
that
fleshy
woman
his
wife
my
is
he
not
handsome
and
he
so
clever
one
of
our
greatest
senators
if
size
makes
a
man
great
and
he
has
the
distinguished
honour
of
being
one
of
senators
he
must
be
a
great
a
very
great
man
he
a
splendid
orator
you
should
hear
him
speak
he
has
kept
his
mouth
shut
all
day
and
when
he
does
open
it
it
is
only
to
speak
in
french
to
his
wife
my
curiosity
is
excited
it
would
be
quite
a
treat
to
hear
him
talk
on
any
subject
when
speaks
it
always
to
the
purpose
but
there
no
one
here
who
is
able
to
appreciate
talents
like
his
he
an
american
aristocrat
we
have
no
aristocrats
with
us
he
a
great
and
immensely
rich
very
substantial
claims
to
distinction
i
must
confess
you
are
wiser
in
these
matters
than
we
are
what
do
you
think
of
canada
i
do
know
it
very
well
for
a
young
place
i
only
came
here
with
sister
last
night
we
are
on
our
way
to
quebec
to
visit
friends
we
have
no
friends
in
canada
we
want
to
see
lord
elgin
lord
elgin
yes
we
have
seen
a
great
many
curious
things
but
we
never
saw
an
english
lord
and
you
are
going
to
quebec
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
look
at
lord
elgin
his
lordship
should
feel
himself
highly
flattered
what
sort
of
an
animal
do
you
suppose
him
to
be
a
man
of
course
but
i
assure
you
that
the
boston
ladies
thought
a
great
deal
of
him
sister
and
i
have
plenty
of
time
and
money
at
our
disposal
and
we
wanted
to
see
if
their
opinion
was
correct
well
i
hope
you
may
be
gratified
and
agree
with
the
boston
ladies
that
he
is
a
very
clever
man
is
he
handsome
he
has
an
english
nose
oh
shocking
a
decided
face
i
sure
i
sha
admire
him
but
i
not
anticipate
a
man
may
be
a
fine
looking
fellow
in
spite
of
his
nose
but
what
do
you
think
of
the
falls
well
i
have
not
made
up
my
mind
about
them
i
should
like
to
ride
down
to
the
edge
of
the
river
to
look
at
them
from
below
i
will
order
a
carriage
morning
and
drive
you
down
thank
you
i
can
do
that
for
myself
if
i
have
a
mind
to
i
should
like
to
ride
down
on
horseback
the
path
is
too
steep
no
one
ventures
down
that
terrible
road
on
horseback
but
i
a
capital
rider
no
matter
they
use
cows
for
that
purpose
here
cows
they
are
very
safe
animals
all
the
ladies
ride
down
to
the
falls
on
cows
are
they
fools
wise
women
did
not
you
see
that
fine
drove
of
cows
pass
the
hotel
at
sunset
i
did
i
thought
they
were
driven
into
the
yard
to
be
milked
why
yes
but
those
cows
are
making
fortune
they
serve
a
double
purpose
providing
delicious
butter
and
cream
for
his
customers
and
acting
as
horses
for
the
ladies
i
will
pick
out
the
most
docile
among
them
for
your
excursion
morning
and
see
it
bridled
and
saddled
myself
this
was
too
much
for
the
gravity
of
any
one
my
ran
out
of
the
room
and
i
laughed
aloud
the
poor
girls
began
to
find
out
that
they
were
sold
and
retreated
into
the
balcony
an
hour
afterwards
as
i
was
pacing
through
the
long
gallery
that
led
to
our
sleeping
apartment
one
of
the
many
doors
on
either
side
softly
opened
and
the
youngest
of
these
damsels
stole
out
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
she
said
laying
her
very
white
hand
confidingly
on
my
arm
were
those
englishmen
quizzing
my
sister
and
me
need
you
ask
that
question
said
i
not
a
little
amused
at
her
simplicity
i
never
suspected
it
till
i
saw
your
son
laughing
to
himself
and
then
i
guessed
something
was
wrong
it
was
a
great
shame
of
those
rude
fellows
to
amuse
themselves
at
our
expense
but
your
son
is
quite
a
different
person
so
handsome
and
gentlemanly
we
admire
him
so
much
is
he
married
his
wife
is
my
daughter
i
ca
tell
why
my
answer
struck
the
fair
inquirer
dumb
she
drew
back
suddenly
into
her
chamber
and
closed
the
door
without
bidding
me
good
night
and
that
was
the
last
time
i
saw
or
heard
of
her
and
her
companion
a
summer
spent
at
the
clifton
house
would
elicit
more
extraordinary
traits
of
character
than
could
be
gathered
from
the
of
a
dozen
novels
thought
i
as
i
paced
on
to
no
the
last
room
on
the
long
tier
i
was
up
by
daybreak
the
next
morning
to
see
the
falls
by
sunrise
and
was
amply
repaid
for
leaving
my
warm
bed
and
encountering
the
bright
bracing
morning
air
by
two
hours
enjoyment
of
solemn
converse
alone
with
god
and
niagara
the
sun
had
not
yet
lifted
his
majestic
head
above
the
pine
forest
or
chased
with
his
beams
the
dark
shadows
of
night
that
rested
within
the
curved
sides
of
the
great
the
waters
looked
black
as
they
rolled
in
vast
smooth
masses
downward
till
meeting
the
projecting
rocks
they
were
tossed
high
into
the
air
in
clouds
of
dazzling
foam
so
pure
so
stainlessly
white
when
contrasted
with
the
darkness
that
they
looked
as
if
belonging
to
heaven
rather
than
to
earth
anon
that
dancing
feathery
tumult
of
foam
catches
a
rosy
gleam
from
the
coming
day
a
long
stream
of
sunlight
touches
the
centre
of
the
mighty
arch
and
transforms
the
black
waters
into
a
mass
of
smooth
transparent
emerald
green
and
the
spray
flashes
with
myriads
of
rubies
and
diamonds
while
the
american
fall
still
rolls
and
thunders
on
in
cold
pure
whiteness
goat
island
and
its
crests
of
dark
pines
shrouding
it
in
a
robe
of
gloom
the
voice
of
the
waters
rising
amidst
the
silence
that
reigns
at
that
lovely
calm
hour
sounds
sonorous
and
grand
be
still
o
my
soul
earth
is
pouring
to
her
creator
her
morning
anthem
of
solemn
praise
earth
how
beautiful
thou
art
when
will
men
be
worthy
of
the
paradise
in
which
they
are
placed
did
our
first
father
amidst
the
fresh
young
beauty
of
his
eden
ever
gaze
upon
a
spectacle
more
worthy
of
his
admiration
than
this
we
will
except
those
moments
when
he
held
converse
with
god
amid
the
cool
shades
of
that
delicious
garden
that
a
sublime
sight
said
a
voice
near
me
i
turned
and
found
the
old
american
gentleman
at
my
side
i
can
see
a
change
in
the
appearance
of
these
falls
he
continued
since
i
visited
them
some
forty
years
ago
time
changes
everything
i
feel
that
i
am
changed
since
then
i
was
young
and
active
and
clambered
about
these
rugged
banks
with
the
careless
hardihood
of
a
boy
who
pants
for
excitement
and
adventure
and
how
i
enjoyed
my
visit
to
this
place
a
change
has
taken
place
i
can
scarcely
describe
in
what
respect
but
it
looks
to
me
very
different
to
what
it
did
then
perhaps
i
suggested
the
fall
of
that
large
portion
of
the
has
made
the
alteration
you
describe
you
have
just
hit
it
he
said
i
forgot
the
circumstance
the
is
not
so
perfect
as
it
was
could
these
falls
ever
have
receded
from
queenstone
said
i
he
turned
to
me
with
a
quick
smile
if
they
have
my
dear
madam
the
world
is
much
older
by
thousands
of
ages
than
we
give
it
credit
for
but
continued
he
gazing
at
the
mighty
object
in
dispute
it
is
possible
that
these
falls
are
of
more
recent
date
than
the
creation
of
the
world
an
earthquake
may
have
rent
the
deep
chasm
that
forms
the
bed
of
that
river
and
in
a
few
seconds
of
time
the
same
cause
might
break
down
that
mighty
barrier
and
drain
the
upper
lakes
by
converting
a
large
part
of
your
fine
province
into
another
inland
sea
but
this
is
all
theory
fancy
you
know
is
free
and
i
often
amuse
myself
by
speculating
on
these
things
your
daughter
i
hope
is
not
ill
i
said
i
did
not
see
her
at
tea
last
night
with
her
little
son
instead
of
his
usual
shrewd
smile
the
old
man
laughed
heartily
so
you
take
that
young
lady
for
my
daughter
is
she
not
the
child
however
must
be
your
grandson
for
he
is
the
picture
of
you
i
flatter
myself
that
he
is
that
young
lady
is
my
wife
that
little
boy
my
son
is
he
a
fine
clever
little
chap
and
his
keen
grey
eye
brightened
at
the
growing
promise
of
his
boy
i
have
another
younger
than
him
heavens
thought
i
what
a
mistake
i
have
made
how
m
will
laugh
at
me
and
how
delighted
this
old
man
seems
with
my
confusion
i
am
always
making
these
odd
blunders
not
long
ago
i
mistook
a
very
young
man
for
his
father
and
congratulated
him
on
his
daughter
marriage
and
asked
a
young
bride
who
was
returning
her
calls
and
who
greatly
resembled
a
married
cousin
who
lived
in
the
same
town
her
baby
was
and
now
i
had
taken
a
man
wife
for
his
daughter
his
son
for
a
grandson
but
i
comforted
myself
with
the
idea
that
the
vast
disparity
between
their
ages
was
some
excuse
and
so
slipped
past
one
of
the
horns
of
that
dilemma
as
soon
as
we
had
taken
breakfast
we
set
off
in
company
with
the
american
and
his
little
boy
to
pay
a
visit
to
goat
island
and
look
at
the
falls
from
the
american
side
the
child
fully
realized
his
description
he
was
a
charming
frank
graceful
boy
full
of
life
and
intelligence
and
enjoyed
the
excitement
of
crossing
the
river
and
the
beauties
it
revealed
to
us
with
a
keen
appreciation
of
the
scene
which
would
have
been
incomprehensible
to
some
of
the
we
had
met
the
day
before
all
nature
contributed
to
heighten
our
enjoyment
the
heavens
were
so
blue
and
cloudless
the
air
so
clear
and
transparent
the
changing
tints
on
the
autumnal
foliage
so
rich
the
sun
so
bright
and
warm
that
we
seemed
surrounded
by
an
enchanted
atmosphere
and
the
very
consciousness
of
existence
was
delightful
but
with
those
descending
floods
of
light
towering
above
us
and
filling
the
echoing
shores
with
their
sublime
melody
we
were
doubly
blessed
when
our
little
boat
touched
the
american
shore
the
question
arose
as
to
which
method
would
be
the
best
to
adopt
in
ascending
the
giddy
height
a
covered
way
leads
to
the
top
of
the
bank
which
is
more
than
two
hundred
feet
in
perpendicular
height
up
this
steep
our
ingenious
neighbours
have
constructed
on
an
inclined
plane
of
boards
a
railway
on
which
two
cars
run
in
such
a
manner
that
the
weight
of
the
descending
car
draws
up
the
other
to
the
top
of
the
bank
both
are
secured
by
a
strong
cable
by
the
side
of
this
railway
and
under
the
same
roof
steps
lead
to
the
road
above
i
was
too
weak
to
attempt
the
formidable
flight
of
steps
and
though
i
felt
rather
cowardly
while
looking
at
the
giddy
ascent
of
the
cars
there
was
no
alternative
between
choosing
one
or
the
other
or
remaining
behind
the
american
and
his
little
boy
were
already
in
the
car
and
i
took
my
seat
behind
them
when
we
were
the
question
rose
in
my
mind
what
if
the
cable
should
give
way
where
should
we
land
you
know
that
when
the
tail
breaks
as
the
highlander
said
when
holding
on
to
the
wild
boar
and
i
shut
my
eyes
determined
not
to
disturb
my
mind
or
waken
my
fears
by
another
glance
below
why
do
you
shut
your
eyes
said
the
american
i
thought
the
english
were
all
brave
i
never
was
a
coward
till
after
i
came
to
north
america
said
i
laughing
and
i
felt
that
i
ought
to
be
as
brave
as
a
lion
and
not
injure
the
reputation
of
my
glorious
country
by
such
childish
fears
when
the
car
stopped
we
parted
company
with
the
american
and
his
brave
little
son
he
had
friends
to
visit
in
manchester
and
i
saw
them
no
more
our
path
lay
through
a
pretty
shady
grove
to
the
village
groups
of
indian
women
and
children
were
reposing
beneath
the
shade
of
the
trees
working
at
their
pretty
wares
which
they
offered
for
sale
as
we
passed
by
following
the
winding
of
the
road
we
crossed
a
rural
bridge
from
which
we
enjoyed
a
fine
view
of
the
glorious
rapids
and
entered
goat
island
this
beautiful
spot
is
still
in
forest
but
the
underbrush
has
been
cleared
away
and
a
path
cut
entirely
round
it
the
trunks
of
these
trees
are
entirely
covered
with
the
names
and
initials
of
persons
who
at
different
times
have
visited
the
spot
and
they
present
the
most
curious
appearance
after
a
few
minutes
walk
through
the
wood
we
reached
the
bank
of
the
river
which
here
is
not
very
high
and
is
covered
with
evergreen
shrubs
and
wild
flowers
and
here
the
wide
world
of
tumbling
waters
are
flashing
and
foaming
in
the
sunlight
leaping
and
racing
round
the
rocky
islands
that
vainly
oppose
their
frantic
course
oh
how
i
longed
to
stem
their
unstemmed
tides
to
land
upon
those
magic
islands
which
the
foot
of
man
or
beast
never
trod
whose
beauty
and
verdure
are
guarded
by
the
stern
hand
of
death
the
falls
are
more
wonderful
but
not
more
beautiful
than
this
sublime
confusion
and
din
of
waters
of
glad
rejoicing
waters
of
living
leaping
waters
their
eternal
voice
and
motion
might
truly
be
termed
the
joy
of
waves
on
the
american
side
the
view
of
the
great
cataracts
is
not
so
awful
and
overwhelming
but
they
are
more
beautiful
in
detail
and
present
so
many
exquisite
pictures
to
the
eye
they
are
more
involved
in
mystery
as
it
were
and
so
much
is
left
for
the
imagination
to
combine
into
every
varied
form
of
beauty
you
look
down
into
the
profound
abyss
you
are
wetted
with
that
shower
of
silvery
spray
that
rises
higher
than
the
tree
tops
and
which
gives
you
in
that
soft
rain
an
actual
consciousness
of
its
living
presence
i
did
not
cross
the
bridge
which
extends
within
a
few
yards
of
the
great
plunge
or
climb
to
the
top
of
the
tower
for
my
strength
had
so
entirely
failed
me
that
it
was
with
difficulty
i
could
retrace
my
steps
i
sat
for
about
an
hour
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
trees
feasting
my
soul
with
beauty
and
with
reluctance
that
drew
tears
from
my
eyes
bade
adieu
to
the
enchanting
spot
not
for
ever
i
hope
for
should
god
prolong
my
life
i
shall
try
and
visit
the
falls
again
like
every
perfect
work
the
more
frequently
and
closely
they
are
examined
the
more
wonderful
they
must
appear
the
mind
and
eye
can
never
weary
of
such
an
astonishing
combination
of
sublimity
and
power
we
stopped
at
a
pretty
cottage
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
to
get
a
glass
of
water
and
to
buy
some
peaches
for
these
we
had
to
pay
treble
the
price
at
which
they
could
be
procured
at
toronto
but
they
proved
a
delicious
refreshment
the
day
was
very
warm
and
i
was
parched
with
thirst
had
time
permitted
i
should
have
enjoyed
greatly
a
ramble
through
the
town
as
it
was
my
brief
acquaintance
with
the
american
shores
left
a
very
pleasing
impression
on
my
mind
the
little
that
i
have
seen
of
intelligent
americans
has
given
me
a
very
high
opinion
of
the
people
britain
may
be
proud
of
these
noble
scions
from
the
parent
tree
whose
fame
like
her
own
is
destined
to
fill
the
world
the
great
daughter
of
a
great
mother
america
claims
renown
for
her
lawful
inheritance
and
it
is
to
be
deeply
regretted
that
any
petty
jealousy
or
party
feeling
should
ever
create
a
rivalry
between
countries
so
closely
united
by
the
ties
of
blood
whose
origin
language
religion
and
genius
are
the
same
whose
industry
energy
and
perseverance
derived
from
their
british
sires
have
procured
for
them
the
lofty
position
they
hold
and
made
them
independent
of
the
despots
of
earth
the
land
of
our
birth
there
is
not
a
spot
in
this
earth
so
dear
to
the
heart
as
the
land
of
our
birth
is
the
home
of
our
childhood
the
beautiful
spot
by
retain
when
all
else
is
forgot
may
the
blessing
of
god
ever
hallow
the
sod
and
its
valleys
and
hills
by
our
children
be
trode
can
the
language
of
strangers
in
accents
unknown
send
a
thrill
to
the
bosom
like
that
of
our
own
the
face
may
be
fair
and
the
smile
may
be
bland
but
it
breathes
not
the
tones
of
our
dear
native
land
there
no
spot
on
earth
like
the
home
of
our
birth
where
heroes
keep
guard
the
altar
and
hearth
how
sweet
is
the
language
that
taught
us
to
blend
the
dear
names
of
father
of
husband
and
friend
that
taught
us
to
lisp
on
our
mother
fond
breast
the
ballads
she
sang
as
she
rock
us
to
rest
may
the
blessing
of
god
ever
hallow
the
sod
and
its
valleys
and
hills
by
our
children
be
trode
may
old

long
lift
her
white
crest
the

the

may
peace

excel

speak
the
honest
truth

boldly
fearlessly
what
thou
right
and
time
shall
justify
thy
words
and
thee
we
left
niagara
at
noon
a
very
pleasant
drive
brought
us
to
queenstone
and
we
stepped
on
board
the
chief
justice
steamboat
that
had
just
touched
the
wharf
and
was
on
her
return
trip
to
toronto
tired
and
ill
i
was
glad
to
lie
down
in
one
of
the
berths
in
the
ladies
cabin
to
rest
and
if
possible
to
obtain
a
little
sleep
this
i
soon
found
was
out
of
the
question
two
or
three
noisy
spoiled
children
kept
up
a
constant
din
and
their
grandmother
a
very
old
lady
who
seemed
to
them
all
endeavoured
in
vain
to
keep
them
quiet
their
mother
was
reading
a
novel
and
took
it
very
easy
reclining
on
a
comfortable
sofa
she
left
her
old
mother
all
the
fatigue
of
taking
care
of
the
children
and
waiting
upon
herself
this
is
by
no
means
an
uncommon
trait
of
canadian
character
in
families
belonging
more
especially
to
the
middle
class
who
have
raised
themselves
from
a
lower
to
a
higher
grade
the
mother
if
left
in
poor
circumstances
almost
invariably
holds
a
subordinate
position
in
her
wealthier
son
or
daughter
family
she
superintends
the
servants
and
nurses
the
younger
children
and
her
time
is
occupied
by
a
number
of
minute
domestic
labours
that
allow
her
very
little
rest
in
her
old
age
i
have
seen
the
grandmother
in
a
wealthy
family
ironing
the
fine
linen
or
broiling
over
the
while
her
daughter
held
her
place
in
the
how
differently
in
my
own
country
are
these
things
ordered
where
the
most
tender
attention
is
paid
to
the
aged
all
their
wants
studied
and
their
comfort
regarded
as
a
sacred
thing
age
in
canada
is
seldom
honoured
you
would
imagine
it
almost
a
crime
for
any
one
to
grow
old
with
such
slighting
cold
indifference
are
the
aged
treated
by
the
young
and
strong
it
is
not
unusual
to
hear
a
lad
speak
of
his
father
perhaps
in
the
prime
of
life
as
the
old
fellow
the
old
boy
and
to
address
a
man
in
this
disrespectful
and
familiar
manner
this
may
not
be
apparent
to
the
natives
themselves
but
it
never
fails
to
strike
every
stranger
that
visits
the
colony
to
be
a
servant
is
a
lot
sufficiently
hard
to
have
all
your
actions
dictated
to
you
by
the
will
of
another
to
enjoy
no
rest
or
recreation
but
such
as
is
granted
as
a
very
great
favour
but
to
be
a
humble
dependent
in
old
age
on
children
to
whom
all
the
best
years
of
your
life
were
devoted
with
all
the
energy
of
maternal
love
must
be
sad
indeed
but
they
submit
with
great
apparent
cheerfulness
and
seem
to
think
it
necessary
to
work
for
the
shelter
of
a
child
roof
and
the
bread
they
eat
the
improved
circumstances
of
families
whose
parents
in
the
first
settlement
of
the
country
had
to
work
very
hard
for
their
general
maintenance
may
be
the
cause
of
this
inversion
of
moral
duties
and
the
parents
not
being
considered
properly
on
an
equality
with
their
better
dressed
and
better
educated
offspring
but
from
whatever
cause
it
springs
the
effect
it
produces
on
the
mind
of
a
stranger
is
very
painful
it
is
difficult
to
feel
much
respect
for
any
one
who
looks
down
upon
father
or
mother
as
an
inferior
being
and
as
such
considers
them
better
qualified
to
perform
the
coarse
drudgeries
of
life
time
we
hope
will
remedy
this
evil
with
many
others
of
the
same
class
there
was
a
bride
too
on
board
a
very
delicate
looking
young
woman
who
was
returning
from
a
tour
in
the
states
to
her
native
village
she
seemed
very
much
to
dread
the
ordeal
she
had
yet
to
pass
through
in
sitting
dressed
up
for
a
whole
week
to
receive
visitors
nor
did
i
in
the
least
wonder
at
her
repugnance
to
go
through
this
trying
piece
of
ceremonial
which
is
absolutely
indispensable
in
canada
the
monday
after
the
bride
and
bridegroom
make
their
first
appearance
at
church
every
person
in
the
same
class
prepares
to
pay
them
a
visit
of
congratulation
and
if
the
town
is
large
and
the
parties
well
known
the
making
of
visits
to
the
bride
lasts
to
the
end
of
the
week
the
bride
who
is
often
a
young
girl
from
sixteen
to
twenty
years
of
age
is
doomed
for
this
period
to
sit
upon
a
sofa
or
reclined
in
an
easy
chair
dressed
in
the
most
expensive
manner
to
receive
her
guests
well
she
knows
that
herself
her
dress
the
furniture
of
her
room
even
her
cake
and
wine
will
undergo
the
most
minute
scrutiny
and
be
the
theme
of
conversation
among
all
the
gossips
of
the
place
for
the
next
nine
days
no
wonder
that
she
feels
nervous
and
that
her
manners
are
constrained
and
that
nothing
looks
easy
or
natural
about
her
from
her
to
her
have
you
seen
the
bride
yet
what
do
you
think
of
her
how
was
she
dressed
is
she
tall
or
short
pretty
or
plain
stupid
or
clever
lively
or
quiet
are
all
questions
certain
to
be
asked
and
answered
according
to
the
taste
and
judgment
of
the
parties
to
whom
they
are
put
besides
those
thousand
little
interludes
which
spring
from
envy
and
all
uncharitableness
the
week
following
they
in
courtesy
must
return
all
these
visits
and
oh
what
a
relief
it
must
be
when
all
this
stiff
complimentary
nonsense
is
over
and
they
are
once
more
at
home
to
themselves
and
their
own
particular
friends
there
is
another
custom
peculiar
to
canada
and
the
united
states
which
i
cordially
approve
and
should
be
very
much
grieved
for
its
discontinuance
on
day
all
the
gentlemen
in
the
place
call
upon
their
friends
to
wish
them
a
happy
new
year
and
to
exchange
friendly
greetings
with
the
ladies
of
the
family
who
are
always
in
readiness
to
receive
them
and
make
them
a
return
for
these
marks
of
neighbourly
regard
in
the
substantial
form
of
rich
cakes
fruit
wine
coffee
and
tea
it
is
generally
a
happy
cheerful
day
all
faces
wear
a
smile
old
quarrels
are
forgotten
and
every
one
seems
anxious
to
let
and
die
with
the
old
year
a
gentleman
who
wishes
to
drop
an
inconvenient
acquaintance
has
only
to
omit
calling
upon
his
friend
wife
and
daughters
on
day
without
making
a
suitable
apology
for
the
omission
of
this
usual
act
of
courtesy
and
the
hint
is
acknowledged
by
a
direct
cut
the
next
time
the
parties
meet
in
public
it
is
an
especial
frolic
for
all
the
lads
who
have
just
returned
from
school
or
college
to
enjoy
their
christmas
holidays
cakes
and
sweetmeats
are
showered
upon
them
in
abundance
and
they
feel
themselves
of
vast
importance
while
paying
their
compliments
to
the
ladies
and
running
from
house
to
house
with
their
brief
congratulatory
address
i
wish
you
all
a
happy
new
year
it
would
be
a
thousand
pities
if
this
affectionate
hospitable
custom
should
be
swept
away
by
the
march
of
modern
improvement
some
ladies
complain
that
it
gives
a
number
of
vulgar
underbred
men
the
opportunity
of
introducing
themselves
to
the
notice
and
company
of
their
daughters
there
may
be
some
reasonable
truth
in
this
remark
but
after
all
it
is
but
for
one
day
and
the
kindly
greetings
exchanged
are
more
productive
of
good
than
evil
the
evening
of
day
is
generally
devoted
to
dancing
parties
when
the
young
especially
meet
to
enjoy
themselves
the
wesleyan
methodists
always
pray
the
old
year
out
and
the
new
year
in
as
it
is
termed
here
and
they
could
not
celebrate
its
advent
in
a
more
rational
and
improving
manner
their
midnight
anthem
of
praise
is
a
sacred
and
beautiful
offering
to
him
whose
vast
existence
is
not
meted
out
like
ours
and
measured
by
days
and
years
large
parties
given
to
very
young
children
which
are
so
common
in
this
country
are
very
pernicious
in
the
way
in
which
they
generally
operate
upon
youthful
minds
they
foster
the
passions
of
vanity
and
envy
and
produce
a
love
of
dress
and
display
which
is
very
repulsive
in
the
character
of
a
child
little
girls
who
are
in
the
constant
habit
of
attending
these
parties
soon
exchange
the
natural
manners
and
frank
simplicity
so
delightful
at
their
age
for
the
confidence
and
flippancy
of
women
long
hacked
in
the
ways
of
the
world
for
some
time
after
i
settled
in
the
town
i
was
not
myself
aware
that
any
evil
could
exist
in
a
harmless
party
of
children
playing
together
at
the
house
of
a
mutual
friend
but
observation
has
convinced
me
that
i
was
in
error
that
these
parties
operate
like
a
forcing
bed
upon
young
plants
with
this
difference
that
they
bring
to
maturity
the
seeds
of
instead
of
those
of
goodness
and
virtue
and
that
a
child
accustomed
to
the
heated
atmosphere
of
pleasure
is
not
likely
in
maturer
years
to
enjoy
the
pure
air
and
domestic
avocations
of
home
these
juvenile
parties
appear
to
do
less
mischief
to
boys
than
to
girls
they
help
to
humanize
the
one
and
to
make
heartless
coquets
of
the
other
the
boys
meet
for
a
romping
play
with
each
other
the
girls
to
be
caressed
and
admired
to
show
off
their
fine
dresses
and
to
gossip
about
the
dress
and
appearance
of
their
neighbours
i
know
that
i
shall
be
called
for
this
assertion
but
it
is
true
i
have
frequently
witnessed
what
i
relate
both
at
my
own
house
and
the
houses
of
others
and
those
who
will
take
the
pains
to
listen
to
the
conversation
of
these
miniature
women
will
soon
yield
a
willing
assent
to
my
observations
and
keep
their
little
ones
apart
from
such
scenes
in
the
pure
atmosphere
of
home
the
garden
or
the
green
field
is
the
best
place
for
children
who
can
always
derive
entertainment
and
instruction
from
nature
and
her
beautiful
works
left
to
their
own
choice
the
gay
party
would
be
a
far
less
entertaining
than
a
game
of
buff
in
the
when
lessons
were
over
it
is
the
vanity
of
parents
that
fosters
the
same
spirit
in
their
children
the
careless
disrespectful
manner
often
used
in
this
country
by
children
to
their
parents
is
an
evil
which
in
all
probability
originates
in
this
early
introduction
of
young
people
into
the
mysteries
of
society
they
imagine
themselves
persons
of
consequence
and
that
their
opinion
is
quite
equal
in
weight
to
the
experience
and
superior
knowledge
of
their
elders
we
can
not
imagine
a
more
revolting
sight
than
a
young
lad
presuming
to
treat
his
father
with
disrespect
and
contempt
and
daring
presumptuously
to
contradict
him
before
ignorant
idlers
like
himself
you
are
wrong
sir
it
is
not
so
mamma
that
is
not
true
i
know
better
are
expressions
which
i
have
heard
with
painful
surprise
from
young
people
in
this
country
and
the
parents
have
sunk
into
silence
evidently
abashed
at
the
reproof
of
an
insolent
child
these
remarks
are
made
with
no
but
with
a
sincere
hope
that
they
may
prove
beneficial
to
the
community
at
large
and
be
the
means
of
removing
some
of
the
evils
which
are
to
be
found
in
our
otherwise
pleasant
and
society
i
know
that
it
would
be
easier
for
me
to
gain
the
approbation
of
the
canadian
public
by
exaggerating
the
advantages
to
be
derived
from
a
settlement
in
the
colony
by
praising
all
the
good
qualities
of
her
people
and
by
throwing
a
flattering
veil
over
their
defects
but
this
is
not
my
object
and
such
servile
adulation
would
do
them
no
good
and
degrade
me
in
my
own
eyes
i
have
written
what
i
consider
to
be
the
truth
and
as
such
i
hope
it
may
do
good
by
preparing
the
minds
of
emigrants
for
what
they
will
rather
than
by
holding
out
fallacious
hopes
that
can
never
be
realized
in
roughing
it
in
the
bush
i
gave
an
honest
personal
statement
of
i
related
nothing
but
what
had
really
happened
and
if
illustrations
were
wanting
of
persons
who
had
suffered
and
been
reduced
to
the
same
straits
i
could
furnish
a
dozen
volumes
without
having
to
travel
many
hundred
miles
for
subjects
we
worked
hard
and
struggled
manfully
with
overwhelming
difficulties
yet
i
have
been
abused
most
unjustly
by
the
canadian
papers
for
revealing
some
of
the
mysteries
of
the
backwoods
not
one
word
was
said
the
in
my
book
as
was
falsely
asserted
it
was
written
as
a
warning
to
persons
not
to
settle
in
localities
for
which
they
were
unfitted
by
their
habits
and
in
this
i
hoped
to
confer
a
service
both
on
them
and
canada
for
the
settlement
of
such
persons
on
cleared
farms
must
prove
more
beneficial
to
the
colony
than
their
in
the
it
was
likewise
very
cruelly
and
falsely
asserted
that
i
had
spoken
ill
of
the
because
i
described
the
revolting
scene
we
witnessed
at
grosse
isle
the
actors
in
which
were
principally
irish
emigrants
of
the
lowest
had
i
been
able
to
give
the
whole
details
of
what
we
saw
on
that
island
the
terms
applied
to
the
people
who
furnished
such
disgusting
pictures
would
have
been
echoed
by
their
own
countrymen
this
was
one
of
those
cases
in
which
it
was
to
reveal
the
the
few
irish
characters
that
occur
in
my
narrative
have
been
drawn
with
an
not
a
malignant
hand
we
had
very
few
irish
settlers
round
us
in
the
bush
and
to
them
i
never
owed
the
least
obligation
the
contrary
of
this
has
been
asserted
and
i
am
accused
of
by
one
editor
for
benefits
i
never
received
and
which
i
was
too
proud
to
ask
always
preferring
to
work
with
my
own
hands
rather
than
to
or
from
others
all
the
kind
acts
of
courtesy
i
received
from
the
this
gentleman
thought
fit
to
turn
over
to
the
irish
in
order
to
hold
me
up
as
a
monster
of
ingratitude
to
his
countrymen
in
the
case
of
jenny
buchannon
and
john
monaghan
only
two
irish
with
whom
i
had
anything
to
do
the
benefits
were
surely
mutual
monaghan
came
to
us
a
runaway
apprentice
not
the
best
recommendation
for
a
servant
we
received
him
starving
and
ragged
paid
him
good
wages
and
treated
him
with
great
kindness
the
boy
turned
out
a
grateful
and
attached
creature
which
can
not
possible
confer
the
opposite
character
upon
us
love
and
will
sufficiently
prove
to
to
the
good
qualities
of
these
people
i
have
done
ample
justice
in
what
then
does
my
ingratitude
to
the
consist
i
should
feel
much
obliged
to
the
writer
in
the
to
enlighten
me
on
this
head
or
those
editors
of
canadian
papers
who
without
reading
for
themselves
servilely
copied
a
it
is
easy
to
pervert
people
words
and
the
facts
they
may
represent
to
their
injury
and
what
i
have
said
on
the
subject
of
education
may
give
a
handle
to
persons
who
delight
in
misrepresenting
the
opinions
of
others
to
accuse
me
of
republican
principles
i
will
therefore
say
a
few
words
on
this
subject
which
i
trust
will
exonerate
me
from
this
imputation
that
all
men
morally
speaking
are
equal
in
the
eyes
of
their
maker
appears
to
me
a
fact
though
some
may
be
called
by
his
providence
to
rule
and
others
to
serve
that
the
welfare
of
the
most
humble
should
be
as
dear
to
the
country
to
which
he
belongs
as
the
best
educated
and
the
most
wealthy
seems
but
reasonable
to
a
reflective
mind
who
looks
upon
man
as
a
responsible
and
immortal
creature
but
that
can
exist
in
a
world
where
the
labour
of
man
is
required
to
procure
the
common
necessaries
of
life
where
the
industry
of
one
will
create
wealth
and
the
sloth
of
another
induce
poverty
we
can
not
believe
some
master
spirit
will
rule
and
the
masses
will
bow
down
to
superior
intellect
and
the
wealth
and
importance
which
such
minds
never
fail
to
acquire
the
laws
must
be
enforced
and
those
to
whom
the
charge
of
them
is
committed
will
naturally
exercise
authority
and
demand
respect
perfect
equality
never
did
exist
upon
earth
the
old
republics
were
more
despotic
and
exclusive
in
their
separation
of
the
different
grades
than
modern
monarchies
and
in
the
most
enlightened
that
of
greece
the
plague
spot
of
slavery
was
found
the
giant
republic
whose
rising
greatness
throws
into
shade
the
once
august
names
of
greece
and
rome
suffers
this
leprosy
to
cleave
to
her
vitals
and
sully
her
fair
fame
making
her
boasted
vaunt
of
a
base
lie
the
scorn
of
all
christian
men
they
thrust
the
enfranchised
african
from
their
public
tables
born
beneath
their
own
skies
a
native
of
their
own
soil
a
free
citizen
by
their
own
declaration
of
independence
yet
exclaim
in
the
face
of
this
injustice
our
people
enjoy
equal
rights
alas
for
sons
where
is
their
equality
on
what
footing
do
they
stand
with
their
white
brethren
what
value
do
they
place
upon
the
negro
beyond
his
price
in
dollars
and
cents
yet
is
he
equal
in
the
sight
of
him
who
gave
him
a
rational
soul
and
afforded
him
the
means
of
attaining
eternal
life
we
are
advocates
for
of
for
a
commonwealth
of
intellect
we
earnestly
hope
for
it
ardently
pray
for
it
and
we
feel
a
confident
belief
in
the
possibility
of
our
theory
we
look
forward
to
the
day
when
honest
labour
will
be
made
honourable
when
he
who
serves
and
he
who
commands
will
rejoice
in
this
freedom
of
soul
together
when
both
master
and
servant
will
enjoy
a
reciprocal
communion
of
mind
without
lessening
the
respect
due
from
the
one
to
the
other
but
equality
of
station
is
a
dream
an
error
which
is
hourly
contradicted
by
reality
as
the
world
is
at
present
constituted
such
a
state
of
things
is
impossible
the
rich
and
the
educated
will
never
look
upon
the
poor
and
ignorant
as
their
equals
and
the
voice
of
the
public
that
is
ever
influenced
by
wealth
and
power
will
bear
them
out
in
their
decision
the
country
is
not
yet
in
existence
that
can
present
us
a
better
government
and
wiser
institutions
than
the
british
long
may
canada
recognise
her
rule
and
rejoice
in
her
sway
should
she
ever
be
so
unwise
as
to
relinquish
the
privileges
she
enjoys
under
the
sovereignty
of
the
mother
country
she
may
seek
protection
and
worse
the
sorrows
and
trials
that
i
experienced
during
my
first
eight
residence
in
canada
have
been
more
than
counterbalanced
by
the
remaining
twelve
of
comfort
and
peace
i
have
long
felt
the
deepest
interest
in
her
prosperity
and
improvement
i
no
longer
regard
myself
as
an
alien
on
her
shores
but
her
daughter
by
adoption
the
happy
mother
of
canadian
children
rejoicing
in
the
warmth
and
hospitality
of
a
canadian
home
may
the
blessing
of
god
rest
upon
the
land
and
her
people
ever
prosper
under
a
religious
liberal
and
free
government
for
london
a
national
song
for
london
for
london
how
oft
has
that
cry
from
the
blue
waves
of
ocean
been
wafted
on
high
when
the
tar
through
the
grey
mist
that
mantled
the
tide
the
white
cliffs
of
england
with
rapture
descried
and
the
sight
of
his
country
awoke
in
his
heart
emotions
no
object
save
home

impart
for

of

the

the
brave

the

thy

thy
temples
and

like
a
crown
on
the

are
hail
with
a
thrill
of
delight
by
the
brave
when
returning
triumphant
from

afar

wreathe
round
thy
