preface
in
the
introduction
to
his
charming
tales
of
old
japan
mitford
wrote
in
books
which
have
been
written
of
late
years
about
japan
have
either
been
compiled
from
official
records
or
have
contained
the
sketchy
impressions
of
passing
travellers
of
the
inner
life
of
the
japanese
the
world
at
large
knows
but
little
their
religion
their
superstitions
their
ways
of
thought
the
hidden
springs
by
which
they
move
all
these
are
as
yet
mysteries
this
invisible
life
referred
to
by
mitford
is
the
unfamiliar
japan
of
which
i
have
been
able
to
obtain
a
few
glimpses
the
reader
may
perhaps
be
disappointed
by
their
rarity
for
a
residence
of
little
more
than
four
years
among
the
people
even
by
one
who
tries
to
adopt
their
habits
and
customs
scarcely
suffices
to
enable
the
foreigner
to
begin
to
feel
at
home
in
this
world
of
strangeness
none
can
feel
more
than
the
author
himself
how
little
has
been
accomplished
in
these
volumes
and
how
much
remains
to
do
the
popular
religious
ideas
especially
the
ideas
derived
from
buddhism
and
the
curious
superstitions
touched
upon
in
these
sketches
are
little
shared
by
the
educated
classes
of
new
japan
except
as
regards
his
characteristic
indifference
toward
abstract
ideas
in
general
and
metaphysical
speculation
in
particular
the
occidentalised
japanese
of
stands
almost
on
the
intellectual
plane
of
the
cultivated
parisian
or
bostonian
but
he
is
inclined
to
treat
with
undue
contempt
all
conceptions
of
the
supernatural
and
toward
the
great
religious
questions
of
the
hour
his
attitude
is
one
of
perfect
apathy
rarely
does
his
university
training
in
modern
philosophy
impel
him
to
attempt
any
independent
study
of
relations
either
sociological
or
psychological
for
him
superstitions
are
simply
superstitions
their
relation
to
the
emotional
nature
of
the
people
interests
him
not
at
all
and
this
not
only
because
he
thoroughly
understands
that
people
but
because
the
class
to
which
he
belongs
is
still
unreasoningly
though
quite
naturally
ashamed
of
its
older
beliefs
most
of
us
who
now
call
ourselves
agnostics
can
recollect
the
feelings
with
which
in
the
period
of
our
fresh
emancipation
from
a
faith
far
more
irrational
than
buddhism
we
looked
back
upon
the
gloomy
theology
of
our
fathers
intellectual
japan
has
become
agnostic
within
only
a
few
decades
and
the
suddenness
of
this
mental
revolution
sufficiently
explains
the
principal
though
not
perhaps
all
the
causes
of
the
present
attitude
of
the
superior
class
toward
buddhism
for
the
time
being
it
certainly
borders
upon
intolerance
and
while
such
is
the
feeling
even
to
religion
as
distinguished
from
superstition
the
feeling
toward
superstition
as
distinguished
from
religion
must
be
something
stronger
still
but
the
rare
charm
of
japanese
life
so
different
from
that
of
all
other
lands
is
not
to
be
found
in
its
europeanised
circles
it
is
to
be
found
among
the
great
common
people
who
represent
in
japan
as
in
all
countries
the
national
virtues
and
who
still
cling
to
their
delightful
old
customs
their
picturesque
dresses
their
buddhist
images
their
household
shrines
their
beautiful
and
touching
worship
of
ancestors
this
is
the
life
of
which
a
foreign
observer
can
never
weary
if
fortunate
and
sympathetic
enough
to
enter
into
it
the
life
that
forces
him
sometimes
to
doubt
whether
the
course
of
our
boasted
western
progress
is
really
in
the
direction
of
moral
development
each
day
while
the
years
pass
there
will
be
revealed
to
him
some
strange
and
unsuspected
beauty
in
it
like
other
life
it
has
its
darker
side
yet
even
this
is
brightness
compared
with
the
darker
side
of
western
existence
it
has
its
foibles
its
follies
its
vices
its
cruelties
yet
the
more
one
sees
of
it
the
more
one
marvels
at
its
extraordinary
goodness
its
miraculous
patience
its
courtesy
its
simplicity
of
heart
its
intuitive
charity
and
to
our
own
larger
occidental
comprehension
its
commonest
superstitions
however
condemned
at
tokyo
have
rarest
value
as
fragments
of
the
unwritten
literature
of
its
hopes
its
fears
its
experience
with
right
and
wrong
its
primitive
efforts
to
find
solutions
for
the
riddle
of
the
unseen
flow
much
the
lighter
and
kindlier
superstitions
of
the
people
add
to
the
charm
of
japanese
life
can
indeed
be
understood
only
by
one
who
has
long
resided
in
the
interior
a
few
of
their
beliefs
are
sinister
such
as
that
in
which
public
education
is
rapidly
dissipating
but
a
large
number
are
comparable
for
beauty
of
fancy
even
to
those
greek
myths
in
which
our
noblest
poets
of
today
still
find
inspiration
while
many
others
which
encourage
kindness
to
the
unfortunate
and
kindness
to
animals
can
never
have
produced
any
but
the
happiest
moral
results
the
amusing
presumption
of
domestic
animals
and
the
comparative
fearlessness
of
many
wild
creatures
in
the
presence
of
man
the
white
clouds
of
gulls
that
hover
about
each
incoming
steamer
in
expectation
of
an
alms
of
crumbs
the
whirring
of
doves
from
to
pick
up
the
rice
scattered
for
them
by
pilgrims
the
familiar
storks
of
ancient
public
gardens
the
deer
of
holy
shrines
awaiting
cakes
and
caresses
the
fish
which
raise
their
heads
from
sacred
when
the
stranger
shadow
falls
upon
the
water
these
and
a
hundred
other
pretty
sights
are
due
to
fancies
which
though
called
superstitious
inculcate
in
simplest
form
the
sublime
truth
of
the
unity
of
life
and
even
when
considering
beliefs
less
attractive
than
these
superstitions
of
which
the
grotesqueness
may
provoke
a
smile
the
impartial
observer
would
do
well
to
bear
in
mind
the
words
of
lecky
many
superstitions
do
undoubtedly
answer
to
the
greek
conception
of
slavish
fear
of
the
gods
and
have
been
productive
of
unspeakable
misery
to
mankind
but
there
are
very
many
others
of
a
different
tendency
superstitions
appeal
to
our
hopes
as
well
as
our
fears
they
often
meet
and
gratify
the
inmost
longings
of
the
heart
they
offer
certainties
where
reason
can
only
afford
possibilities
or
probabilities
they
supply
conceptions
on
which
the
imagination
loves
to
dwell
they
sometimes
impart
even
a
new
sanction
to
moral
truths
creating
wants
which
they
alone
can
satisfy
and
fears
which
they
alone
can
quell
they
often
become
essential
elements
of
happiness
and
their
consoling
efficacy
is
most
felt
in
the
languid
or
troubled
hours
when
it
is
most
needed
we
owe
more
to
our
illusions
than
to
our
knowledge
the
imagination
which
is
altogether
constructive
probably
contributes
more
to
our
happiness
than
the
reason
which
in
the
sphere
of
speculation
is
mainly
critical
and
destructive
the
rude
charm
which
in
the
hour
of
danger
or
distress
the
savage
clasps
so
confidently
to
his
breast
the
sacred
picture
which
is
believed
to
shed
a
hallowing
and
protecting
influence
over
the
poor
man
cottage
can
bestow
a
more
real
consolation
in
the
darkest
hour
of
human
suffering
than
can
be
afforded
by
the
grandest
theories
of
philosophy
no
error
can
be
more
grave
than
to
imagine
that
when
a
critical
spirit
is
abroad
the
pleasant
beliefs
will
all
remain
and
the
painful
ones
alone
will
perish
that
the
critical
spirit
of
modernised
japan
is
now
indirectly
aiding
rather
than
opposing
the
efforts
of
foreign
bigotry
to
destroy
the
simple
happy
beliefs
of
the
people
and
substitute
those
cruel
superstitions
which
the
west
has
long
intellectually
outgrown
the
fancies
of
an
unforgiving
god
and
an
everlasting
hell
is
surely
to
be
regretted
more
than
hundred
and
sixty
years
ago
kaempfer
wrote
of
the
japanese
the
practice
of
virtue
in
purity
of
life
and
outward
devotion
they
far
outdo
the
christians
and
except
where
native
morals
have
suffered
by
foreign
contamination
as
in
the
open
ports
these
words
are
true
of
the
japanese
my
own
conviction
and
that
of
many
impartial
and
more
experienced
observers
of
japanese
life
is
that
japan
has
nothing
whatever
to
gain
by
conversion
to
christianity
either
morally
or
otherwise
but
very
much
to
lose
of
the
sketches
composing

volumes

originally
purchased
by
various
newspaper
syndicates

considerably
altered

chapter
one
my
first
day
in
the
orient
not
fail
to
write
down
your
first
impressions
as
soon
as
possible
said
a
kind
english
professor
basil
hall
chamberlain
note
whom
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
soon
after
my
arrival
in
japan
are
evanescent
you
know
they
will
never
come
to
you
again
once
they
have
faded
out
and
yet
of
all
the
strange
sensations
you
may
receive
in
this
country
you
will
feel
none
so
charming
as
these
i
am
trying
now
to
reproduce
them
from
the
hasty
notes
of
the
time
and
find
that
they
were
even
more
fugitive
than
charming
something
has
evaporated
from
all
my
recollections
of
them
something
impossible
to
recall
i
neglected
the
friendly
advice
in
spite
of
all
resolves
to
obey
it
i
could
not
in
those
first
weeks
resign
myself
to
remain
indoors
and
write
while
there
was
yet
so
much
to
see
and
hear
and
feel
in
the
ways
of
the
wonderful
japanese
city
still
even
could
i
revive
all
the
lost
sensations
of
those
first
experiences
i
doubt
if
i
could
express
and
fix
them
in
words
the
first
charm
of
japan
is
intangible
and
volatile
as
a
perfume
it
began
for
me
with
my
first
out
of
the
european
quarter
of
yokohama
into
the
japanese
town
and
so
much
as
i
can
recall
of
it
is
hereafter
set
down
sec
it
is
with
the
delicious
surprise
of
the
first
journey
through
japanese
streets
unable
to
make
one
understand
anything
but
gestures
frantic
gestures
to
roll
on
anywhere
everywhere
since
all
is
unspeakably
pleasurable
and
new
that
one
first
receives
the
real
sensation
of
being
in
the
orient
in
this
far
east
so
much
read
of
so
long
dreamed
of
yet
as
the
eyes
bear
witness
heretofore
all
unknown
there
is
a
romance
even
in
the
first
full
consciousness
of
this
rather
commonplace
fact
but
for
me
this
consciousness
is
transfigured
inexpressibly
by
the
divine
beauty
of
the
day
there
is
some
charm
unutterable
in
the
morning
air
cool
with
the
coolness
of
japanese
spring
and
from
the
snowy
cone
of
fuji
a
charm
perhaps
due
rather
to
softest
lucidity
than
to
any
positive
tone
an
atmospheric
limpidity
extraordinary
with
only
a
suggestion
of
blue
in
it
through
which
the
most
distant
objects
appear
focused
with
amazing
sharpness
the
sun
is
only
pleasantly
warm
the
jinricksha
or
kuruma
is
the
most
cosy
little
vehicle
imaginable
and
the
as
seen
above
the
dancing
white
hat
of
my
sandalled
runner
have
an
allurement
of
which
i
fancy
that
i
could
never
weary
elfish
everything
seems
for
everything
as
well
as
everybody
is
small
and
queer
and
mysterious
the
little
houses
under
their
blue
roofs
the
little
hung
with
blue
and
the
smiling
little
people
in
their
blue
costumes
the
illusion
is
only
broken
by
the
occasional
passing
of
a
tall
foreigner
and
by
divers
bearing
announcements
in
absurd
attempts
at
english
nevertheless
such
discords
only
serve
to
emphasise
reality
they
never
materially
lessen
the
fascination
of
the
funny
little
streets
is
at
first
a
delightfully
odd
confusion
only
as
you
look
down
one
of
them
through
an
interminable
flutter
of
flags
and
swaying
of
dark
blue
drapery
all
made
beautiful
and
mysterious
with
japanese
or
chinese
lettering
for
there
are
no
immediately
discernible
laws
of
construction
or
decoration
each
building
seems
to
have
a
fantastic
prettiness
of
its
own
nothing
is
exactly
like
anything
else
and
all
is
bewilderingly
novel
but
gradually
after
an
hour
passed
in
the
quarter
the
eye
begins
to
recognise
in
a
vague
way
some
general
plan
in
the
construction
of
these
low
light
wooden
houses
mostly
unpainted
with
their
first
stories
all
open
to
the
street
and
thin
strips
of
roofing
sloping
above
each
like
awnings
back
to
the
miniature
balconies
of
second
stories
you
begin
to
understand
the
common
plan
of
the
tiny
shops
with
their
matted
floors
well
raised
above
the
street
level
and
the
general
perpendicular
arrangement
of
whether
undulating
on
drapery
or
glimmering
on
gilded
and
lacquered
signboards
you
observe
that
the
same
rich
dark
blue
which
dominates
in
popular
costume
rules
also
in
shop
draperies
though
there
is
a
sprinkling
of
other
tints
bright
blue
and
white
and
red
no
greens
or
yellows
and
then
you
note
also
that
the
dresses
of
the
labourers
are
lettered
with
the
same
wonderful
lettering
as
the
shop
draperies
no
arabesques
could
produce
such
an
effect
as
modified
for
decorative
purposes
these
ideographs
have
a
speaking
symmetry
which
no
design
without
a
meaning
could
possess
as
they
appear
on
the
back
of
a
workman
frock
pure
white
on
dark
blue
and
large
enough
to
be
easily
read
at
a
great
distance
indicating
some
guild
or
company
of
which
the
wearer
is
a
member
or
employee
they
give
to
the
poor
cheap
garment
a
fictitious
appearance
of
splendour
and
finally
while
you
are
still
puzzling
over
the
mystery
of
things
there
will
come
to
you
like
a
revelation
the
knowledge
that
most
of
the
amazing
picturesqueness
of
these
streets
is
simply
due
to
the
profusion
of
chinese
and
japanese
characters
in
white
black
blue
or
gold
decorating
everything
even
surfaces
of
doorposts
and
paper
screens
perhaps
then
for
one
moment
you
will
imagine
the
effect
of
english
lettering
substituted
for
those
magical
characters
and
the
mere
idea
will
give
to
whatever
aesthetic
sentiment
you
may
possess
a
brutal
shock
and
you
will
become
as
i
have
become
an
enemy
of
the
that
society
founded
for
the
ugly
utilitarian
purpose
of
introducing
the
use
of
english
letters
in
writing
japanese
sec
an
ideograph
does
not
make
upon
the
japanese
brain
any
impression
similar
to
that
created
in
the
occidental
brain
by
a
letter
or
combination
of
letters
dull
inanimate
symbols
of
vocal
sounds
to
the
japanese
brain
an
ideograph
is
a
vivid
picture
it
lives
it
speaks
it
gesticulates
and
the
whole
space
of
a
japanese
street
is
full
of
such
living
characters
figures
that
cry
out
to
the
eyes
words
that
smile
or
grimace
like
faces
what
such
lettering
is
compared
with
our
own
lifeless
types
can
be
understood
only
by
those
who
have
lived
in
the
farther
east
for
even
the
printed
characters
of
japanese
or
chinese
imported
texts
give
no
suggestion
of
the
possible
beauty
of
the
same
characters
as
modified
for
decorative
inscriptions
for
sculptural
use
or
for
the
commonest
advertising
purposes
no
rigid
convention
fetters
the
fancy
of
the
calligrapher
or
designer
each
strives
to
make
his
characters
more
beautiful
than
any
others
and
generations
upon
generations
of
artists
have
been
toiling
from
time
immemorial
with
like
emulation
so
that
through
centuries
and
centuries
of
tireless
effort
and
study
the
primitive
hieroglyph
or
ideograph
has
been
evolved
into
a
thing
of
beauty
indescribable
it
consists
only
of
a
certain
number
of
but
in
each
stroke
there
is
an
undiscoverable
secret
art
of
grace
proportion
imperceptible
curve
which
actually
makes
it
seem
alive
and
bears
witness
that
even
during
the
of
its
creation
the
artist
felt
with
his
brush
for
the
ideal
shape
of
the
stroke
equally
along
its
entire
length
from
head
to
tail
but
the
art
of
the
strokes
is
not
all
the
art
of
their
combination
is
that
which
produces
the
enchantment
often
so
as
to
astonish
the
japanese
themselves
it
is
not
surprising
indeed
considering
the
strangely
personal
animate
esoteric
aspect
of
japanese
lettering
that
there
should
be
wonderful
legends
of
calligraphy
relating
how
words
written
by
holy
experts
became
incarnate
and
descended
from
their
tablets
to
hold
converse
with
mankind
sec
my
kurumaya
calls
himself
he
has
a
white
hat
which
looks
like
the
top
of
an
enormous
mushroom
a
short
blue
jacket
blue
drawers
as
and
reaching
to
his
ankles
and
light
straw
sandals
bound
upon
his
bare
feet
with
cords
of
doubtless
he
typifies
all
the
patience
endurance
and
insidious
coaxing
powers
of
his
class
he
has
already
manifested
his
power
to
make
me
give
him
more
than
the
law
allows
and
i
have
been
warned
against
him
in
vain
for
the
first
sensation
of
having
a
human
being
for
a
horse
trotting
between
shafts
unwearyingly
bobbing
up
and
down
before
you
for
hours
is
alone
enough
to
evoke
a
feeling
of
compassion
and
when
this
human
being
thus
trotting
between
shafts
with
all
his
hopes
memories
sentiments
and
comprehensions
happens
to
have
the
gentlest
smile
and
the
power
to
return
the
least
favour
by
an
apparent
display
of
infinite
gratitude
this
compassion
becomes
sympathy
and
provokes
unreasoning
impulses
to
i
think
the
sight
of
the
profuse
perspiration
has
also
something
to
do
with
the
feeling
for
it
makes
one
think
of
the
cost
of
and
likewise
of
chills
congestions
and
pleurisy
cha
clothing
is
drenched
and
he
mops
his
face
with
a
small
towel
with
figures
of
and
sparrows
in
white
upon
it
which
towel
he
carries
wrapped
about
his
wrist
as
he
runs
that
however
which
attracts
me
in
cha
cha
considered
not
as
a
motive
power
at
all
but
as
a
personality
i
am
rapidly
learning
to
discern
in
the
multitudes
of
faces
turned
toward
us
as
we
roll
through
these
miniature
streets
and
perhaps
the
supremely
pleasurable
impression
of
this
morning
is
that
produced
by
the
singular
gentleness
of
popular
scrutiny
everybody
looks
at
you
curiously
but
there
is
never
anything
disagreeable
much
less
hostile
in
the
gaze
most
commonly
it
is
accompanied
by
a
smile
or
half
smile
and
the
ultimate
consequence
of
all
these
kindly
curious
looks
and
smiles
is
that
the
stranger
finds
himself
thinking
of
hackneyed
to
the
degree
of
provocation
this
statement
no
doubt
is
everybody
describing
the
sensations
of
his
first
japanese
day
talks
of
the
land
as
fairyland
and
of
its
people
as
yet
there
is
a
natural
reason
for
this
unanimity
in
choice
of
terms
to
describe
what
is
almost
impossible
to
describe
more
accurately
at
the
first
essay
to
find
one
self
suddenly
in
a
world
where
everything
is
upon
a
smaller
and
daintier
scale
than
with
us
a
world
of
lesser
and
seemingly
kindlier
beings
all
smiling
at
you
as
if
to
wish
you
well
a
world
where
all
movement
is
slow
and
soft
and
voices
are
hushed
a
world
where
land
life
and
sky
are
unlike
all
that
one
has
known
elsewhere
this
is
surely
the
realisation
for
imaginations
nourished
with
english
folklore
of
the
old
dream
of
a
world
of
elves
sec
the
traveller
who
enters
suddenly
into
a
period
of
social
change
especially
change
from
a
feudal
past
to
a
democratic
present
is
likely
to
regret
the
decay
of
things
beautiful
and
the
ugliness
of
things
new
what
of
both
i
may
yet
discover
in
japan
i
know
not
but
in
these
exotic
streets
the
old
and
the
new
mingle
so
well
that
one
seems
to
set
off
the
other
the
line
of
tiny
white
telegraph
poles
carrying
the
world
news
to
papers
printed
in
a
mixture
of
chinese
and
japanese
characters
an
electric
bell
in
some
with
an
oriental
riddle
of
text
pasted
beside
the
ivory
button
a
shop
of
american
next
to
the
shop
of
a
maker
of
buddhist
images
the
establishment
of
a
photographer
beside
the
establishment
of
a
manufacturer
of
straw
sandals
all
these
present
no
striking
incongruities
for
each
sample
of
occidental
innovation
is
set
into
an
oriental
frame
that
seems
adaptable
to
any
picture
but
on
the
first
day
at
least
the
old
alone
is
new
for
the
stranger
and
suffices
to
absorb
his
attention
it
then
appears
to
him
that
everything
japanese
is
delicate
exquisite
admirable
even
a
pair
of
common
wooden
chopsticks
in
a
paper
bag
with
a
little
drawing
upon
it
even
a
package
of
toothpicks
of
bound
with
a
paper
wrapper
wonderfully
lettered
in
three
different
colours
even
the
little
towel
with
designs
of
flying
sparrows
upon
it
which
the
jinricksha
man
uses
to
wipe
his
face
the
bank
bills
the
commonest
copper
coins
are
things
of
beauty
even
the
piece
of
plaited
coloured
string
used
by
the
shopkeeper
in
tying
up
your
last
purchase
is
a
pretty
curiosity
curiosities
and
dainty
objects
bewilder
you
by
their
very
multitude
on
either
side
of
you
wherever
you
turn
your
eyes
are
countless
wonderful
things
as
yet
incomprehensible
but
it
is
perilous
to
look
at
them
every
time
you
dare
to
look
something
obliges
you
to
buy
it
unless
as
may
often
happen
the
smiling
vendor
invites
your
inspection
of
so
many
varieties
of
one
article
each
specially
and
all
unspeakably
desirable
that
you
flee
away
out
of
mere
terror
at
your
own
impulses
the
shopkeeper
never
asks
you
to
buy
but
his
wares
are
enchanted
and
if
you
once
begin
buying
you
are
lost
cheapness
means
only
a
temptation
to
commit
bankruptcy
for
the
resources
of
irresistible
artistic
cheapness
are
inexhaustible
the
largest
steamer
that
crosses
the
pacific
could
not
contain
what
you
wish
to
purchase
for
although
you
may
not
perhaps
confess
the
fact
to
yourself
what
you
really
want
to
buy
is
not
the
contents
of
a
shop
you
want
the
shop
and
the
shopkeeper
and
streets
of
shops
with
their
draperies
and
their
inhabitants
the
whole
city
and
the
bay
and
the
mountains
begirdling
it
and
fujiyama
white
witchery
overhanging
it
in
the
speckless
sky
all
japan
in
very
truth
with
its
magical
trees
and
luminous
atmosphere
with
all
its
cities
and
towns
and
temples
and
forty
millions
of
the
most
lovable
people
in
the
universe
now
there
comes
to
my
mind
something
i
once
heard
said
by
a
practical
american
on
hearing
of
a
great
fire
in
japan
those
people
can
afford
fires
their
houses
are
so
cheaply
built
it
is
true
that
the
frail
wooden
houses
of
the
common
people
can
be
cheaply
and
quickly
replaced
but
that
which
was
within
them
to
make
them
beautiful
can
not
and
every
fire
is
an
art
tragedy
for
this
is
the
land
of
infinite
variety
machinery
has
not
yet
been
able
to
introduce
sameness
and
utilitarian
ugliness
in
cheap
production
except
in
response
to
foreign
demand
for
bad
taste
to
suit
vulgar
markets
and
each
object
made
by
the
artist
or
artisan
differs
still
from
all
others
even
of
his
own
making
and
each
time
something
beautiful
perishes
by
fire
it
is
a
something
representing
an
individual
idea
happily
the
art
impulse
itself
in
this
country
of
conflagrations
has
a
vitality
which
survives
each
generation
of
artists
and
defies
the
flame
that
changes
their
labour
to
ashes
or
melts
it
to
shapelessness
the
idea
whose
symbol
has
perished
will
reappear
again
in
other
creations
perhaps
after
the
passing
of
a
century
modified
indeed
yet
recognisably
of
kin
to
the
thought
of
the
past
and
every
artist
is
a
ghostly
worker
not
by
years
of
groping
and
sacrifice
does
he
find
his
highest
expression
the
sacrificial
past
is
within
him
his
art
is
an
inheritance
his
fingers
are
guided
by
the
dead
in
the
delineation
of
a
flying
bird
of
the
vapours
of
mountains
of
the
colours
of
the
morning
and
the
evening
of
the
shape
of
branches
and
the
spring
burst
of
flowers
generations
of
skilled
workmen
have
given
him
their
cunning
and
revive
in
the
wonder
of
his
drawing
what
was
conscious
effort
in
the
beginning
became
unconscious
in
later
centuries
becomes
almost
automatic
in
the
living
man
becomes
the
art
instinctive
wherefore
one
coloured
print
by
a
hokusai
or
hiroshige
originally
sold
for
less
than
a
cent
may
have
more
real
art
in
it
than
many
a
western
painting
valued
at
more
than
the
worth
of
a
whole
japanese
street
sec
here
are
hokusai
own
figures
walking
about
in
straw
raincoats
and
immense
hats
of
straw
and
straw
sandals
peasants
deeply
tanned
by
wind
and
sun
and
mothers
with
smiling
bald
babies
on
their
backs
toddling
by
upon
their
geta
high
noisy
wooden
clogs
and
robed
merchants
squatting
and
smoking
their
little
brass
pipes
among
the
countless
riddles
of
their
shops
then
i
notice
how
small
and
shapely
the
feet
of
the
people
are
whether
bare
brown
feet
of
peasants
or
beautiful
feet
of
children
wearing
tiny
tiny
geta
or
feet
of
young
girls
in
snowy
tabi
the
tabi
the
white
digitated
stocking
gives
to
a
small
light
foot
a
mythological
aspect
the
white
cleft
grace
of
the
foot
of
a
fauness
clad
or
bare
the
japanese
foot
has
the
antique
symmetry
it
has
not
yet
been
distorted
by
the
infamous
which
has
deformed
the
feet
of
occidentals
of
every
pair
of
japanese
wooden
clogs
one
makes
in
walking
a
slightly
different
sound
from
the
other
as
kring
to
krang
so
that
the
echo
of
the
walker
steps
has
an
alternate
rhythm
of
tones
on
a
pavement
such
as
that
of
a
railway
station
the
sound
obtains
immense
sonority
and
a
crowd
will
sometimes
intentionally
fall
into
step
with
the
drollest
conceivable
result
of
drawling
wooden
noise
sec
e
yuke
i
have
been
obliged
to
return
to
the
european
hotel
not
because
of
the
as
i
really
begrudge
myself
the
time
necessary
to
eat
it
but
because
i
can
not
make
cha
understand
that
i
want
to
visit
a
buddhist
temple
now
cha
understands
my
landlord
has
uttered
the
mystical
words
e
yuke
a
few
minutes
of
running
along
broad
thoroughfares
lined
with
gardens
and
costly
ugly
european
buildings
then
passing
the
bridge
of
a
canal
stocked
with
unpainted
craft
of
extraordinary
construction
we
again
plunge
into
narrow
low
bright
pretty
streets
into
another
part
of
the
japanese
city
and
cha
runs
at
the
top
of
his
speed
between
more
rows
of
little
houses
narrower
above
than
below
between
other
unfamiliar
lines
of
little
open
shops
and
always
over
the
shops
little
strips
of
roof
slope
back
to
the
chamber
of
upper
floors
and
from
all
the
facades
hang
draperies
dark
blue
or
white
or
crimson
of
texture
covered
with
beautiful
japanese
lettering
white
on
blue
red
on
black
black
on
white
but
all
this
flies
by
swiftly
as
a
dream
once
more
we
cross
a
canal
we
rush
up
a
narrow
street
rising
to
meet
a
hill
and
cha
halting
suddenly
before
an
immense
flight
of
broad
stone
steps
sets
the
shafts
of
his
vehicle
on
the
ground
that
i
may
dismount
and
pointing
to
the
steps
exclaims
i
dismount
and
ascend
them
and
reaching
a
broad
terrace
find
myself
face
to
face
with
a
wonderful
gate
topped
by
a
tilted
peaked
chinese
roof
it
is
all
strangely
carven
this
gate
dragons
are
in
a
frieze
above
its
open
doors
and
the
panels
of
the
doors
themselves
are
similarly
sculptured
and
there
are
gargoyles
grotesque
lion
heads
protruding
from
the
eaves
and
the
whole
is
grey
to
me
nevertheless
the
carvings
do
not
seem
to
have
the
fixity
of
sculpture
all
the
snakeries
and
dragonries
appear
to
undulate
with
a
swarming
motion
elusively
in
eddyings
as
of
water
i
turn
a
moment
to
look
back
through
the
glorious
light
sea
and
sky
mingle
in
the
same
beautiful
pale
clear
blue
below
me
the
billowing
of
bluish
roofs
reaches
to
the
verge
of
the
unruffled
bay
on
the
right
and
to
the
feet
of
the
green
wooded
hills
flanking
the
city
on
two
sides
beyond
that
semicircle
of
green
hills
rises
a
lofty
range
of
serrated
mountains
indigo
silhouettes
and
enormously
high
above
the
line
of
them
towers
an
apparition
indescribably
lovely
one
solitary
snowy
cone
so
filmily
exquisite
so
spiritually
white
that
but
for
its
immemorially
familiar
outline
one
would
surely
deem
it
a
shape
of
cloud
invisible
its
base
remains
being
the
same
delicious
tint
as
the
sky
only
above
the
eternal
its
dreamy
cone
appears
seeming
to
hang
the
ghost
of
a
peak
between
the
luminous
land
and
the
luminous
heaven
the
sacred
and
matchless
mountain
fujiyama
and
suddenly
a
singular
sensation
comes
upon
me
as
i
stand
before
this
weirdly
sculptured
portal
a
sensation
of
dream
and
doubt
it
seems
to
me
that
the
steps
and
the
gate
and
the
blue
sky
arching
over
the
roofs
of
the
town
and
the
ghostly
beauty
of
fuji
and
the
shadow
of
myself
there
stretching
upon
the
grey
masonry
must
all
vanish
presently
why
such
a
feeling
doubtless
because
the
forms
before
me
the
curved
roofs
the
coiling
dragons
the
chinese
grotesqueries
of
carving
do
not
really
appear
to
me
as
things
new
but
as
things
dreamed
the
sight
of
them
must
have
stirred
to
life
forgotten
memories
of
a
moment
and
the
delusion
vanishes
the
romance
of
reality
returns
with
freshened
consciousness
of
all
that
which
is
truly
and
deliciously
new
the
magical
transparencies
of
distance
the
wondrous
delicacy
of
the
tones
of
the
living
picture
the
enormous
height
of
the
summer
blue
and
the
white
soft
witchery
of
the
japanese
sun
sec
i
pass
on
and
climb
more
steps
to
a
second
gate
with
similar
gargoyles
and
swarming
of
dragons
and
enter
a
court
where
graceful
votive
lanterns
of
stone
stand
like
monuments
on
my
right
and
left
two
great
grotesque
stone
lions
are
sitting
the
lions
of
buddha
male
and
female
beyond
is
a
long
low
light
building
with
curved
and
gabled
roof
of
blue
tiles
and
three
wooden
steps
before
its
entrance
its
sides
are
simple
wooden
screens
covered
with
thin
white
paper
this
is
the
temple
on
the
steps
i
take
off
my
shoes
a
young
man
slides
aside
the
screens
closing
the
entrance
and
bows
me
a
gracious
welcome
and
i
go
in
feeling
under
my
feet
a
softness
of
matting
thick
as
bedding
an
immense
square
apartment
is
before
me
full
of
an
unfamiliar
sweet
smell
the
scent
of
japanese
incense
but
after
the
full
blaze
of
the
sun
the
light
here
is
dim
as
moonshine
for
a
minute
or
two
i
can
see
nothing
but
gleams
of
gilding
in
a
soft
gloom
then
my
eyes
becoming
accustomed
to
the
obscurity
i
perceive
against
the
screens
surrounding
the
sanctuary
on
three
sides
shapes
of
enormous
flowers
cutting
like
silhouettes
against
the
vague
white
light
i
approach
and
find
them
to
be
paper
flowers
symbolic
beautifully
coloured
with
curling
leaves
gilded
on
the
upper
surface
and
bright
green
beneath
at
the
dark
end
of
the
apartment
facing
the
entrance
is
the
altar
of
buddha
a
rich
and
lofty
altar
covered
with
bronzes
and
gilded
utensils
clustered
to
right
and
left
of
a
shrine
like
a
tiny
gold
temple
but
i
see
no
statue
only
a
mystery
of
unfamiliar
shapes
of
burnished
metal
relieved
against
darkness
a
darkness
behind
the
shrine
and
altar
whether
recess
or
inner
sanctuary
i
can
not
distinguish
the
young
attendant
who
ushered
me
into
the
temple
now
approaches
and
to
my
great
surprise
exclaims
in
excellent
english
pointing
to
a
richly
decorated
gilded
object
between
groups
of
candelabra
on
the
altar
is
the
shrine
of
buddha
i
would
like
to
make
an
offering
to
buddha
i
respond
is
not
necessary
he
says
with
a
polite
smile
but
i
insist
and
he
places
the
little
offering
for
me
upon
the
altar
then
he
invites
me
to
his
own
room
in
a
wing
of
the
building
a
large
luminous
room
without
furniture
beautifully
matted
and
we
sit
down
upon
the
floor
and
chat
he
tells
me
he
is
a
student
in
the
temple
he
learned
english
in
tokyo
and
speaks
it
with
a
curious
accent
but
with
fine
choice
of
words
finally
he
asks
me
you
a
christian
and
i
answer
truthfully
you
a
buddhist
exactly
do
you
make
offerings
if
you
do
not
believe
in
buddha
revere
the
beauty
of
his
teaching
and
the
faith
of
those
who
follow
it
there
buddhists
in
england
and
america
are
at
least
a
great
many
interested
in
buddhist
philosophy
and
he
takes
from
an
alcove
a
little
book
and
gives
it
to
me
to
examine
it
is
an
english
copy
of
olcott
buddhist
catechism
is
there
no
image
of
buddha
in
your
temple
i
ask
is
a
small
one
in
the
shrine
upon
the
altar
the
student
answers
the
shrine
is
closed
and
we
have
several
large
ones
but
the
image
of
buddha
is
not
exposed
here
every
day
only
upon
festal
days
and
some
images
are
exposed
only
once
or
twice
a
year
from
my
place
i
can
see
between
the
open
paper
screens
men
and
women
ascending
the
steps
to
kneel
and
pray
before
the
entrance
of
the
temple
they
kneel
with
such
naive
reverence
so
gracefully
and
so
naturally
that
the
kneeling
of
our
occidental
devotees
seems
a
clumsy
stumbling
by
comparison
some
only
join
their
hands
others
clap
them
three
times
loudly
and
slowly
then
they
bow
their
heads
pray
silently
for
a
moment
and
rise
and
depart
the
shortness
of
the
prayers
impresses
me
as
something
novel
and
interesting
from
time
to
time
i
hear
the
clink
and
rattle
of
brazen
coin
cast
into
the
great
wooden
at
the
entrance
i
turn
to
the
young
student
and
ask
him
do
they
clap
their
hands
three
times
before
they
pray
he
answers
times
for
the
sansai
the
three
powers
heaven
earth
man
do
they
clap
their
hands
to
call
the
gods
as
japanese
clap
their
hands
to
summon
their
attendants
no
he
replied
clapping
of
hands
represents
only
the
awakening
from
the
dream
of
the
long
night
night
what
dream
he
hesitates
some
moments
before
making
answer
buddha
said
all
beings
are
only
dreaming
in
this
fleeting
world
of
unhappiness
the
clapping
of
hands
signifies
that
in
prayer
the
soul
awakens
from
such
dreaming
understand
what
i
mean
by
the
word
soul
yes
buddhists
believe
the
soul
always
was
always
will
be
in
nirvana
while
we
are
thus
chatting
the
chief
priest
of
the
temple
enters
a
very
aged
by
two
young
priests
and
i
am
presented
to
them
and
the
three
bow
very
low
showing
me
the
glossy
crowns
of
their
heads
before
seating
themselves
in
the
fashion
of
gods
upon
the
floor
i
observe
they
do
not
smile
these
are
the
first
japanese
i
have
seen
who
do
not
smile
their
faces
are
impassive
as
the
faces
of
images
but
their
long
eyes
observe
me
very
closely
while
the
student
interprets
their
questions
and
while
i
attempt
to
tell
them
something
about
the
translations
of
the
sutras
in
our
sacred
books
of
the
east
and
about
the
labours
of
beal
and
burnouf
and
feer
and
davids
and
kern
and
others
they
listen
without
change
of
countenance
and
utter
no
word
in
response
to
the
young
student
translation
of
my
remarks
tea
however
is
brought
in
and
set
before
me
in
a
tiny
cup
placed
in
a
little
brazen
saucer
shaped
like
a
and
i
am
invited
to
partake
of
some
little
kwashi
stamped
with
a
figure
which
i
recognise
as
the
swastika
the
ancient
indian
symbol
of
the
wheel
of
the
law
as
i
rise
to
go
all
rise
with
me
and
at
the
steps
the
student
asks
for
my
name
and
address
he
adds
will
not
see
me
here
again
as
i
am
going
to
leave
the
temple
but
i
will
visit
you
your
name
i
ask
me
akira
he
answers
at
the
threshold
i
bow
my
and
they
all
bow
very
very
low
one
head
three
glossy
heads
like
balls
of
ivory
and
as
i
go
only
akira
smiles
sec
queries
cha
with
his
immense
white
hat
in
his
hand
as
i
resume
my
seat
in
the
jinricksha
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
which
no
doubt
means
do
i
want
to
see
any
more
temples
most
certainly
i
do
i
have
not
yet
seen
buddha
tera
cha
and
again
begins
the
long
panorama
of
mysterious
shops
and
tilted
eaves
and
fantastic
riddles
written
over
everything
i
have
no
idea
in
what
direction
cha
is
running
i
only
know
that
the
streets
seem
to
become
always
narrower
as
we
go
and
that
some
of
the
houses
look
like
great
wickerwork
only
and
that
we
pass
over
several
bridges
before
we
halt
again
at
the
foot
of
another
hill
there
is
a
lofty
flight
of
steps
here
also
and
before
them
a
structure
which
i
know
is
both
a
gate
and
a
symbol
imposing
yet
in
no
manner
resembling
the
great
buddhist
gateway
seen
before
astonishingly
simple
all
the
lines
of
it
are
it
has
no
carving
no
colouring
no
lettering
upon
it
yet
it
has
a
weird
solemnity
an
enigmatic
beauty
it
is
a
torii
observes
cha
not
a
tera
this
time
but
a
shrine
of
the
gods
of
the
more
ancient
faith
of
the
land
a
miya
i
am
standing
before
a
shinto
symbol
i
see
for
the
first
time
out
of
a
picture
at
least
a
torii
how
describe
a
torii
to
those
who
have
never
looked
at
one
even
in
a
photograph
or
engraving
two
lofty
columns
like
supporting
horizontally
two
the
lower
and
lighter
beam
having
its
ends
fitted
into
the
columns
a
little
distance
below
their
summits
the
uppermost
and
larger
beam
supported
upon
the
tops
of
the
columns
and
projecting
well
beyond
them
to
right
and
left
that
is
a
torii
the
construction
varying
little
in
design
whether
made
of
stone
wood
or
metal
but
this
description
can
give
no
correct
idea
of
the
appearance
of
a
torii
of
its
majestic
aspect
of
its
mystical
suggestiveness
as
a
gateway
the
first
time
you
see
a
noble
one
you
will
imagine
perhaps
that
you
see
the
colossal
model
of
some
beautiful
chinese
letter
towering
against
the
sky
for
all
the
lines
of
the
thing
have
the
grace
of
an
animated
ideograph
have
the
bold
angles
and
curves
of
characters
made
with
four
sweeps
of
a
passing
the
torii
i
ascend
a
flight
of
perhaps
one
hundred
stone
steps
and
find
at
their
summit
a
second
torii
from
whose
lower
hangs
festooned
the
mystic
shimenawa
it
is
in
this
case
a
hempen
rope
of
perhaps
two
inches
in
diameter
through
its
greater
length
but
tapering
off
at
either
end
like
a
snake
sometimes
the
shimenawa
is
made
of
bronze
when
the
torii
itself
is
of
bronze
but
according
to
tradition
it
should
be
made
of
straw
and
most
commonly
is
for
it
represents
the
straw
rope
which
the
deity
stretched
behind
the
after
the
had
pulled
her
out
as
is
told
in
that
ancient
myth
of
shinto
which
professor
chamberlain
has
translated
and
the
shimenawa
in
its
commoner
and
simpler
form
has
pendent
tufts
of
straw
along
its
entire
length
at
regular
intervals
because
originally
made
tradition
declares
of
grass
pulled
up
by
the
roots
which
protruded
from
the
twist
of
it
advancing
beyond
this
torii
i
find
myself
in
a
sort
of
park
or
on
the
summit
of
the
hill
there
is
a
small
temple
on
the
right
it
is
all
closed
up
and
i
have
read
so
much
about
the
disappointing
vacuity
of
shinto
temples
that
i
do
not
regret
the
absence
of
its
guardian
and
i
see
before
me
what
is
infinitely
more
interesting
a
grove
of
covered
with
something
unutterably
beautiful
a
dazzling
mist
of
snowy
blossoms
clinging
like
summer
about
every
branch
and
twig
and
the
ground
beneath
them
and
the
path
before
me
is
white
with
the
soft
thick
odorous
snow
of
fallen
petals
beyond
this
loveliness
are
surrounding
tiny
shrines
and
marvellous
full
of
monsters
dragons
and
mythologic
beings
chiselled
in
the
rock
and
miniature
landscape
work
with
tiny
groves
of
dwarf
trees
and
lilliputian
lakes
and
microscopic
brooks
and
bridges
and
cascades
here
also
are
swings
for
children
and
here
are
belvederes
perched
on
the
verge
of
the
hill
wherefrom
the
whole
fair
city
and
the
whole
smooth
bay
speckled
with
no
bigger
than
and
the
far
faint
high
promontories
reaching
into
the
sea
are
all
visible
in
one
delicious
view
in
a
beauty
of
ghostly
haze
indescribable
why
should
the
trees
be
so
lovely
in
japan
with
us
a
plum
or
cherry
tree
in
flower
is
not
an
astonishing
sight
but
here
it
is
a
miracle
of
beauty
so
bewildering
that
however
much
you
may
have
previously
read
about
it
the
real
spectacle
strikes
you
dumb
you
see
no
leaves
only
one
great
filmy
mist
of
petals
is
it
that
the
trees
have
been
so
long
domesticated
and
caressed
by
man
in
this
land
of
the
gods
that
they
have
acquired
souls
and
strive
to
show
their
gratitude
like
women
loved
by
making
themselves
more
beautiful
for
man
sake
assuredly
they
have
mastered
men
hearts
by
their
loveliness
like
beautiful
slaves
that
is
to
say
japanese
hearts
apparently
there
have
been
some
foreign
tourists
of
the
brutal
class
in
this
place
since
it
has
been
deemed
necessary
to
set
up
inscriptions
in
english
announcing
that
is
forbidden
to
injure
the
trees
sec
cha
tera
but
only
for
a
brief
while
do
i
traverse
japanese
streets
the
houses
separate
become
scattered
along
the
feet
of
the
hills
the
city
thins
away
through
little
valleys
and
vanishes
at
last
behind
and
we
follow
a
curving
road
overlooking
the
sea
green
hills
slope
steeply
down
to
the
edge
of
the
way
on
the
right
on
the
left
far
below
spreads
a
vast
stretch
of
dun
sand
and
salty
pools
to
a
line
of
surf
so
distant
that
it
is
discernible
only
as
a
moving
white
thread
the
tide
is
out
and
thousands
of
are
scattered
over
the
sands
at
such
distances
that
their
stooping
figures
dotting
the
glimmering
appear
no
larger
than
gnats
and
some
are
coming
along
the
road
before
us
returning
from
their
search
with
baskets
girls
with
faces
almost
as
rosy
as
the
faces
of
english
girls
as
the
jinricksha
rattles
on
the
hills
dominating
the
road
grow
higher
all
at
once
cha
halts
again
before
the
steepest
and
loftiest
flight
of
temple
steps
i
have
yet
seen
i
climb
and
climb
and
climb
halting
perforce
betimes
to
ease
the
violent
aching
of
my
quadriceps
muscles
reach
the
top
completely
out
of
breath
and
find
myself
between
two
lions
of
stone
one
showing
his
fangs
the
other
with
jaws
closed
before
me
stands
the
temple
at
the
farther
end
of
a
small
bare
plateau
surrounded
on
three
sides
by
low
cliffs
small
temple
looking
very
old
and
grey
from
a
rocky
height
to
the
left
of
the
building
a
little
cataract
rumbles
down
into
a
pool
ringed
in
by
a
palisade
the
voice
of
the
water
drowns
all
other
sounds
a
sharp
wind
is
blowing
from
the
ocean
the
place
is
chill
even
in
the
sun
and
bleak
and
desolate
as
if
no
prayer
had
been
uttered
in
it
for
a
hundred
years
cha
taps
and
calls
while
i
take
off
my
shoes
upon
the
worn
wooden
steps
of
the
temple
and
after
a
minute
of
waiting
we
hear
a
muffled
step
approaching
and
a
hollow
cough
behind
the
paper
screens
they
slide
open
and
an
old
priest
appears
and
motions
me
with
a
low
bow
to
enter
he
has
a
kindly
face
and
his
smile
of
welcome
seems
to
me
one
of
the
most
exquisite
i
have
ever
been
greeted
with
then
he
coughs
again
so
badly
that
i
think
if
i
ever
come
here
another
time
i
shall
ask
for
him
in
vain
i
go
in
feeling
that
soft
spotless
cushioned
matting
beneath
my
feet
with
which
the
floors
of
all
japanese
buildings
are
covered
i
pass
the
indispensable
bell
and
lacquered
and
before
me
i
see
other
screens
only
stretching
from
floor
to
ceiling
the
old
man
still
coughing
slides
back
one
of
these
upon
the
right
and
waves
me
into
the
dimness
of
an
inner
sanctuary
haunted
by
faint
odours
of
incense
a
colossal
bronze
lamp
with
snarling
gilded
dragons
coiled
about
its
columnar
stem
is
the
first
object
i
discern
and
in
passing
it
my
shoulder
sets
ringing
a
festoon
of
little
bells
suspended
from
the
summit
of
it
then
i
reach
the
altar
gropingly
unable
yet
to
distinguish
forms
clearly
but
the
priest
sliding
back
screen
after
screen
pours
in
light
upon
the
gilded
brasses
and
the
inscriptions
and
i
look
for
the
image
of
the
deity
or
presiding
spirit
between
the
of
convoluted
candelabra
and
i
see
only
a
mirror
a
round
pale
disk
of
polished
metal
and
my
own
face
therein
and
behind
this
mockery
of
me
a
phantom
of
the
far
sea
only
a
mirror
symbolising
what
illusion
or
that
the
universe
exists
for
us
solely
as
the
reflection
of
our
own
souls
or
the
old
chinese
teaching
that
we
must
seek
the
buddha
only
in
our
own
hearts
perhaps
some
day
i
shall
be
able
to
find
out
all
these
things
as
i
sit
on
the
temple
steps
putting
on
my
shoes
preparatory
to
going
the
kind
old
priest
approaches
me
again
and
bowing
presents
a
bowl
i
hastily
drop
some
coins
in
it
imagining
it
to
be
a
buddhist
before
discovering
it
to
be
full
of
hot
water
but
the
old
beautiful
courtesy
saves
me
from
feeling
all
the
grossness
of
my
mistake
without
a
word
and
still
preserving
his
kindly
smile
he
takes
the
bowl
away
and
returning
presently
with
another
bowl
empty
fills
it
with
hot
water
from
a
little
kettle
and
makes
a
sign
to
me
to
drink
tea
is
most
usually
offered
to
visitors
at
temples
but
this
little
shrine
is
very
very
poor
and
i
have
a
suspicion
that
the
old
priest
suffers
betimes
for
want
of
what
no
should
be
permitted
to
need
as
i
descend
the
windy
steps
to
the
roadway
i
see
him
still
looking
after
me
and
i
hear
once
more
his
hollow
cough
then
the
mockery
of
the
mirror
recurs
to
me
i
am
beginning
to
wonder
whether
i
shall
ever
be
able
to
discover
that
which
i
seek
outside
of
myself
that
is
outside
of
my
own
imagination
sec
once
more
queries
cha
no
it
is
getting
late
hotel
cha
but
cha
turning
the
corner
of
a
narrow
street
on
our
homeward
route
halts
the
jinricksha
before
a
shrine
or
tiny
temple
scarcely
larger
than
the
smallest
of
japanese
shops
yet
more
of
a
surprise
to
me
than
any
of
the
larger
sacred
edifices
already
visited
for
on
either
side
of
the
entrance
stand
two
nude
demoniac
fearfully
muscled
with
feet
like
lions
and
hands
brandishing
gilded
thunderbolts
and
eyes
of
delirious
fury
the
guardians
of
holy
things
the
or
two
kings
and
right
between
these
crimson
monsters
a
young
girl
stands
looking
at
us
her
slight
figure
in
robe
of
silver
grey
and
girdle
of
relieved
deliciously
against
the
twilight
darkness
of
the
interior
her
face
impassive
and
curiously
delicate
would
charm
wherever
seen
but
here
by
strange
contrast
with
the
frightful
grotesqueries
on
either
side
of
her
it
produces
an
effect
unimaginable
then
i
find
myself
wondering
whether
my
feeling
of
repulsion
toward
those
twin
monstrosities
be
altogether
lust
seeing
that
so
charming
a
maiden
deems
them
worthy
of
veneration
and
they
even
cease
to
seem
ugly
as
i
watch
her
standing
there
between
them
dainty
and
slender
as
some
splendid
moth
and
always
naively
gazing
at
the
foreigner
utterly
unconscious
that
they
might
have
seemed
to
him
both
unholy
and
uncomely
what
are
they
artistically
they
are
buddhist
transformations
of
brahma
and
of
indra
enveloped
by
the
absorbing
magical
atmosphere
of
buddhism
indra
can
now
wield
his
thunderbolts
only
in
defence
of
the
faith
which
has
dethroned
him
he
has
become
a
keeper
of
the
temple
gates
nay
has
even
become
a
servant
of
bosatsu
bodhisattvas
for
this
is
only
a
shrine
of
kwannon
goddess
of
mercy
not
yet
a
buddha
cha
hotel
i
cry
out
again
for
the
way
is
long
and
the
sun
sinking
sinking
in
the
softest
imaginable
glow
of
topazine
light
i
have
not
seen
shaka
so
the
japanese
have
transformed
the
name
i
have
not
looked
upon
the
face
of
the
buddha
perhaps
i
may
be
able
to
find
his
image
somewhere
in
this
wilderness
of
wooden
streets
or
upon
the
summit
of
some
yet
unvisited
hill
the
sun
is
gone
the
is
gone
and
cha
stops
to
light
his
lantern
of
paper
and
we
hurry
on
again
between
two
long
lines
of
painted
paper
lanterns
suspended
before
the
shops
so
closely
set
so
level
those
lines
are
that
they
seem
two
interminable
strings
of
pearls
of
fire
and
suddenly
a
sound
solemn
profound
mighty
peals
to
my
ears
over
the
roofs
of
the
town
the
voice
of
the
tsurigane
the
great
of
nogiyama
all
too
short
the
day
seemed
yet
my
eyes
have
been
so
long
dazzled
by
the
great
white
light
and
so
confused
by
the
sorcery
of
that
interminable
maze
of
mysterious
signs
which
made
each
street
vista
seem
a
glimpse
into
some
enormous
grimoire
that
they
are
now
weary
even
of
the
soft
glowing
of
all
these
paper
lanterns
likewise
covered
with
characters
that
look
like
texts
from
a
book
of
magic
and
i
feel
at
last
the
coming
of
that
drowsiness
which
always
follows
enchantment
sec
a
woman
voice
ringing
through
the
night
chanting
in
a
tone
of
singular
sweetness
words
of
which
each
syllable
comes
through
my
open
window
like
a
wavelet
of
my
japanese
servant
who
speaks
a
little
english
has
told
me
what
they
mean
those
words
and
always
between
these
long
sweet
calls
i
hear
a
plaintive
whistle
one
long
note
first
then
two
short
ones
in
another
key
it
is
the
whistle
of
the
amma
the
poor
blind
woman
who
earns
her
living
by
shampooing
the
sick
or
the
weary
and
whose
whistle
warns
pedestrians
and
drivers
of
vehicles
to
take
heed
for
her
sake
as
she
can
not
see
and
she
sings
also
that
the
weary
and
the
sick
may
call
her
in
the
saddest
melody
but
the
sweetest
voice
her
cry
signifies
that
for
the
sum
of
hundred
mon
she
will
come
and
rub
your
weary
body
and
below
and
make
the
weariness
or
the
pain
go
away
five
hundred
mon
are
the
equivalent
of
five
sen
japanese
cents
there
are
ten
rin
to
a
sen
and
ten
mon
to
one
rin
the
strange
sweetness
of
the
voice
is
haunting
makes
me
even
wish
to
have
some
pains
that
i
might
pay
five
hundred
mon
to
have
them
driven
away
i
lie
down
to
sleep
and
i
dream
i
see
chinese
texts
multitudinous
weird
mysterious
fleeing
by
me
all
in
one
direction
ideographs
white
and
dark
upon
signboards
upon
paper
screens
upon
backs
of
sandalled
men
they
seem
to
live
these
ideographs
with
conscious
life
they
are
moving
their
parts
moving
with
a
movement
as
of
insects
monstrously
like
phasmidae
i
am
rolling
always
through
low
narrow
luminous
streets
in
a
phantom
jinricksha
whose
wheels
make
no
sound
and
always
always
i
see
the
huge
white
hat
of
cha
dancing
up
and
down
before
me
as
he
runs
chapter
two
the
writing
of
kobodaishi
sec
kobodaishi
most
holy
of
buddhist
priests
and
founder
of
the
which
is
the
sect
of
akira
first
taught
the
men
of
japan
to
write
the
writing
called
hiragana
and
the
syllabary
and
kobodaishi
was
himself
the
most
wonderful
of
all
writers
and
the
most
skilful
wizard
among
scribes
and
in
the
book
it
is
related
that
when
he
was
in
china
the
name
of
a
certain
room
in
the
palace
of
the
emperor
having
become
effaced
by
time
the
emperor
sent
for
him
and
bade
him
write
the
name
anew
thereupon
kobodaishi
took
a
brush
in
his
right
hand
and
a
brush
in
his
left
and
one
brush
between
the
toes
of
his
left
foot
and
another
between
the
toes
of
his
right
and
one
in
his
mouth
also
and
with
those
five
brushes
so
holding
them
he
limned
the
characters
upon
the
wall
and
the
characters
were
beautiful
beyond
any
that
had
ever
been
seen
in
china
as
the
ripples
in
the
current
of
a
river
and
kobodaishi
then
took
a
brush
and
with
it
from
a
distance
spattered
drops
of
ink
upon
the
wall
and
the
drops
as
they
fell
became
transformed
and
turned
into
beautiful
characters
and
the
emperor
gave
to
kobodaishi
the
name
gohitsu
osho
signifying
the
priest
who
writes
with
five
brushes
at
another
time
while
the
saint
was
dwelling
in
takawasan
near
to
kyoto
the
emperor
being
desirous
that
kobodaishi
should
write
the
tablet
for
the
great
temple
called
gave
the
tablet
to
a
messenger
and
bade
him
carry
it
to
kobodaishi
that
kobodaishi
might
letter
it
but
when
the
emperor
messenger
bearing
the
tablet
came
near
to
the
place
where
kobodaishi
dwelt
he
found
a
river
before
him
so
much
swollen
by
rain
that
no
man
might
cross
it
in
a
little
while
however
kobodaishi
appeared
upon
the
farther
bank
and
hearing
from
the
messenger
what
the
emperor
desired
called
to
him
to
hold
up
the
tablet
and
the
messenger
did
so
and
kobodaishi
from
his
place
upon
the
farther
bank
made
the
movements
of
the
letters
with
his
brush
and
as
fast
as
he
made
them
they
appeared
upon
the
tablet
which
the
messenger
was
holding
up
sec
now
in
that
time
kobodaishi
was
wont
to
meditate
alone
by
the
and
one
day
while
so
meditating
he
was
aware
of
a
boy
standing
before
him
gazing
at
him
curiously
the
garments
of
the
boy
were
as
the
garments
worn
by
the
needy
but
his
face
was
beautiful
and
while
kobodaishi
wondered
the
boy
asked
him
you
kobodaishi
whom
men
call
the
priest
who
writes
with
five
brushes
at
once
and
kobodaishi
answered
am
he
then
said
the
boy
you
be
he
write
i
pray
you
upon
the
sky
and
kobodaishi
rising
took
his
brush
and
made
with
it
movements
toward
the
sky
as
if
writing
and
presently
upon
the
face
of
the
sky
the
letters
appeared
most
beautifully
wrought
then
the
boy
said
i
shall
try
and
he
wrote
also
upon
the
sky
as
kobodaishi
had
done
and
he
said
again
to
kobodaishi
pray
you
write
for
me
write
upon
the
surface
of
the
river
then
kobodaishi
wrote
upon
the
water
a
poem
in
praise
of
the
water
and
for
a
moment
the
characters
remained
all
beautiful
upon
the
face
of
the
stream
as
if
they
had
fallen
upon
it
like
leaves
but
presently
they
moved
with
the
current
and
floated
away
i
will
try
said
the
boy
and
he
wrote
upon
the
water
the
the
character
ryu
in
the
writing
which
is
called
sosho
the
and
the
character
remained
upon
the
flowing
surface
and
moved
not
but
kobodaishi
saw
that
the
boy
had
not
placed
the
ten
the
little
dot
belonging
to
the
character
beside
it
and
he
asked
the
boy
did
you
not
put
the
ten
i
forgot
answered
the
boy
put
it
there
for
me
and
kobodaishi
then
made
the
dot
and
lo
the
became
a
dragon
and
the
dragon
moved
terribly
in
the
waters
and
the
sky
darkened
with
and
blazed
with
lightnings
and
the
dragon
ascended
in
a
whirl
of
tempest
to
heaven
then
kobodaishi
asked
the
boy
are
you
and
the
boy
made
answer
am
he
whom
men
worship
on
the
mountain
gotai
i
am
the
lord
of
wisdom
monju
bosatsu
and
even
as
he
spoke
the
boy
became
changed
and
his
beauty
became
luminous
like
the
beauty
of
gods
and
his
limbs
became
radiant
shedding
soft
light
about
and
smiling
he
rose
to
heaven
and
vanished
beyond
the
clouds
sec
but
kobodaishi
himself
once
forgot
to
put
the
ten
beside
the
character
o
on
the
tablet
which
he
painted
with
the
name
of
the
gate
of
the
emperor
palace
and
the
emperor
at
kyoto
having
asked
him
why
he
had
not
put
the
ten
beside
the
character
kobodaishi
answered
forgot
but
i
will
put
it
on
now
then
the
emperor
bade
ladders
be
brought
for
the
tablet
was
already
in
place
high
above
the
gate
but
kobodaishi
standing
on
the
pavement
before
the
gate
simply
threw
his
brush
at
the
tablet
and
the
brush
so
thrown
made
the
ten
there
most
admirably
and
fell
back
into
his
hand
kobodaishi
also
painted
the
tablet
of
the
gate
called
of
the
emperor
palace
at
kyoto
now
there
was
a
man
dwelling
near
that
gate
whose
name
was
kino
momoye
and
he
ridiculed
the
characters
which
kobodaishi
had
made
and
pointed
to
one
of
them
saying
it
looks
like
a
swaggering
wrestler
but
the
same
night
momoye
dreamed
that
a
wrestler
had
come
to
his
bedside
and
leaped
upon
him
and
was
beating
him
with
his
fists
and
crying
out
with
the
pain
of
the
blows
he
awoke
and
saw
the
wrestler
rise
in
air
and
change
into
the
written
character
he
had
laughed
at
and
go
back
to
the
tablet
over
the
gate
and
there
was
another
writer
famed
greatly
for
his
skill
named
onomo
toku
who
laughed
at
some
characters
on
the
tablet
of
the
gate
written
by
kobodaishi
and
he
said
pointing
to
the
character
shu
shu
looks
like
the
character
rice
and
that
night
he
dreamed
that
the
character
he
had
mocked
at
became
a
man
and
that
the
man
fell
upon
him
and
beat
him
and
jumped
up
and
down
upon
his
face
many
times
even
as
a
kometsuki
a
leaps
up
and
down
to
move
the
hammers
that
beat
the
rice
saying
the
while
i
am
the
messenger
of
kobodaishi
and
waking
he
found
himself
bruised
and
bleeding
as
one
that
had
been
grievously
trampled
and
long
after
kobodaishi
death
it
was
found
that
the
names
written
by
him
on
the
two
gates
of
the
emperor
palace
the
gate
of
beautiful
fortune
and
the
gate
of
excellent
greatness
were
effaced
by
time
and
the
emperor
ordered
a
dainagon
whose
name
was
yukinari
to
restore
the
tablets
but
yukinari
was
afraid
to
perform
the
command
of
the
emperor
by
reason
of
what
had
befallen
other
men
and
fearing
the
divine
anger
of
kobodaishi
he
made
offerings
and
prayed
for
some
token
of
permission
and
the
same
night
in
a
dream
kobodaishi
appeared
to
him
smiling
gently
and
said
the
work
even
as
the
emperor
desires
and
have
no
fear
so
he
restored
the
tablets
in
the
first
month
of
the
fourth
year
of
kwanko
as
is
recorded
in
the
book
and
all
these
things
have
been
related
to
me
by
my
friend
akira
chapter
three
jizo
sec
i
have
passed
another
day
in
wandering
among
the
temples
both
shinto
and
buddhist
i
have
seen
many
curious
things
but
i
have
not
yet
seen
the
face
of
the
buddha
repeatedly
after
long
wearisome
climbing
of
stone
steps
and
passing
under
gates
full
of
gargoyles
heads
of
elephants
and
heads
of
lions
and
entering
shoeless
into
scented
twilight
into
enchanted
gardens
of
golden
of
paper
and
there
waiting
for
my
eyes
to
become
habituated
to
the
dimness
i
have
looked
in
vain
for
images
only
an
opulent
glimmering
confusion
of
things
vague
created
by
gilded
bronzes
twisted
into
riddles
by
vessels
of
indescribable
shape
by
enigmatic
texts
of
gold
by
mysterious
glittering
pendent
things
all
framing
in
only
a
shrine
with
doors
fast
closed
what
has
most
impressed
me
is
the
seeming
joyousness
of
popular
faith
i
have
seen
nothing
grim
austere
or
i
have
not
even
noted
anything
approaching
the
solemn
the
bright
temple
courts
and
even
the
temple
steps
are
thronged
with
laughing
children
playing
curious
games
and
mothers
entering
the
sanctuary
to
pray
suffer
their
little
ones
to
creep
about
the
matting
and
crow
the
people
take
their
religion
lightly
and
cheerfully
they
drop
their
cash
in
the
great
clap
their
hands
murmur
a
very
brief
prayer
then
turn
to
laugh
and
talk
and
smoke
their
little
pipes
before
the
temple
entrance
into
some
shrines
i
have
noticed
the
worshippers
do
not
enter
at
all
they
merely
stand
before
the
doors
and
pray
for
a
few
seconds
and
make
their
small
offerings
blessed
are
they
who
do
not
too
much
fear
the
gods
which
they
have
made
sec
akira
is
bowing
and
smiling
at
the
door
he
slips
off
his
sandals
enters
in
his
white
digitated
stockings
and
with
another
smile
and
bow
sinks
gently
into
the
proffered
chair
akira
is
an
interesting
boy
with
his
smooth
beardless
face
and
clear
bronze
skin
and
hair
trimmed
into
a
shock
that
shadows
his
forehead
to
the
eyes
he
has
almost
the
appearance
in
his
long
robe
and
snowy
stockings
of
a
young
japanese
girl
i
clap
my
hands
for
tea
hotel
tea
which
he
calls
tea
i
offer
him
a
cigar
which
he
declines
but
with
my
permission
he
will
smoke
his
pipe
thereupon
he
draws
from
his
girdle
a
japanese
and
combined
pulls
out
of
the
a
little
brass
pipe
with
a
bowl
scarcely
large
enough
to
hold
a
pea
pulls
out
of
the
pouch
some
tobacco
so
finely
cut
that
it
looks
like
hair
stuffs
a
tiny
pellet
of
this
preparation
in
the
pipe
and
begins
to
smoke
he
draws
the
smoke
into
his
lungs
and
blows
it
out
again
through
his
nostrils
three
little
whiffs
at
intervals
of
about
half
a
minute
and
the
pipe
emptied
is
replaced
in
its
case
meanwhile
i
have
related
to
akira
the
story
of
my
disappointments
you
can
see
him
responds
akira
you
will
take
a
walk
with
me
to
the
temple
of
zotokuin
for
this
is
the
busshoe
the
festival
of
the
birthday
of
buddha
but
he
is
very
small
only
a
few
inches
high
if
you
want
to
see
a
great
buddha
you
must
go
to
kamakura
there
is
a
buddha
in
that
place
sitting
upon
a
lotus
and
he
is
fifty
feet
high
so
i
go
forth
under
the
guidance
of
akira
he
says
he
may
be
able
to
show
me
curious
things
sec
there
is
a
sound
of
happy
voices
from
the
temple
and
the
steps
are
crowded
with
smiling
mothers
and
laughing
children
entering
i
find
women
and
babies
pressing
about
a
lacquered
table
in
front
of
the
doorway
upon
it
is
a
little
vessel
of
sweet
tea
amacha
and
standing
in
the
tea
is
a
tiny
figure
of
buddha
one
hand
pointing
upward
and
one
downward
the
women
having
made
the
customary
offering
take
up
some
of
the
tea
with
a
wooden
ladle
of
curious
shape
and
pour
it
over
the
statue
and
then
filling
the
ladle
a
second
time
drink
a
little
and
give
a
sip
to
their
babies
this
is
the
ceremony
of
washing
the
statue
of
buddha
near
the
lacquered
stand
on
which
the
vessel
of
sweet
tea
rests
is
another
and
lower
stand
supporting
a
temple
bell
shaped
like
a
great
bowl
a
priest
approaches
with
a
padded
mallet
in
his
hand
and
strikes
the
bell
but
the
bell
does
not
sound
properly
he
starts
looks
into
it
and
stoops
to
lift
out
of
it
a
smiling
japanese
baby
the
mother
laughing
runs
to
relieve
him
of
his
burden
and
priest
mother
and
baby
all
look
at
us
with
a
frankness
of
mirth
in
which
we
join
akira
leaves
me
a
moment
to
speak
with
one
of
the
temple
attendants
and
presently
returns
with
a
curious
lacquered
box
about
a
foot
in
length
and
four
inches
wide
on
each
of
its
four
sides
there
is
only
a
small
hole
in
one
end
of
it
no
appearance
of
a
lid
of
any
sort
says
akira
you
wish
to
pay
two
sen
we
shall
learn
our
future
lot
according
to
the
will
of
the
gods

two
sen
and
akira
shakes
the
box
out
comes
a
narrow
slip
of
bamboo
with
chinese
characters
written
thereon
cries
akira
the
number
is
again
he
shakes
the
box
a
second
bamboo
slip
issues
from
the
slit
kitsu
great
the
number
is
once
more
the
box
is
shaken
once
more
the
oracular
bamboo
protrudes
laughs
akira
will
befall
us
the
number
is
he
returns
the
box
to
a
priest
and
receives
three
mysterious
papers
numbered
with
numbers
corresponding
to
the
numbers
of
the
bamboo
slips
these
little
bamboo
slips
or
are
called
mikuji
this
as
translated
by
akira
is
the
substance
of
the
text
of
the
paper
numbered
who
draweth
forth
this
mikuji
let
him
live
according
to
the
heavenly
law
and
worship
kwannon
if
his
trouble
be
a
sickness
it
shall
pass
from
him
if
he
have
lost
aught
it
shall
be
found
if
he
have
a
suit
at
law
he
shall
gain
if
he
love
a
woman
he
shall
surely
win
her
though
he
should
have
to
wait
and
many
happinesses
will
come
to
him
the
paper
reads
almost
similarly
with
the
sole
differences
that
instead
of
kwannon
the
deities
of
wealth
and
prosperity
daikoku
bishamon
and
benten
are
to
be
worshipped
and
that
the
fortunate
man
will
not
have
to
wait
at
all
for
the
woman
loved
but
the
kyo
paper
reads
thus
who
draweth
forth
this
mikuji
it
will
be
well
for
him
to
obey
the
heavenly
law
and
to
worship
kwannon
the
merciful
if
he
have
any
sickness
even
much
more
sick
he
shall
become
if
he
have
lost
aught
it
shall
never
be
found
if
he
have
a
suit
at
law
he
shall
never
gain
it
if
he
love
a
woman
let
him
have
no
more
expectation
of
winning
her
only
by
the
most
diligent
piety
can
he
hope
to
escape
the
most
frightful
calamities
and
there
shall
be
no
felicity
in
his
portion
the
same
we
are
fortunate
declares
akira
out
of
three
times
we
have
found
luck
now
we
will
go
to
see
another
statue
of
buddha
and
he
guides
me
through
many
curious
streets
to
the
southern
verge
of
the
city
sec
before
us
rises
a
hill
with
a
broad
flight
of
stone
steps
sloping
to
its
summit
between
foliage
of
cedars
and
maples
we
climb
and
i
see
above
me
the
lions
of
buddha
waiting
the
male
yawning
menace
the
female
with
mouth
closed
passing
between
them
we
enter
a
large
temple
court
at
whose
farther
end
rises
another
wooded
eminence
and
here
is
the
temple
with
roof
of
copper
tiles
and
tilted
eaves
and
gargoyles
and
dragons
all
to
one
neutral
tone
the
paper
screens
are
open
but
a
melancholy
rhythmic
chant
from
within
tells
us
that
the
noonday
service
is
being
held
the
priests
are
chanting
the
syllables
of
sanscrit
texts
transliterated
into
chinese
intoning
the
sutra
called
the
sutra
of
the
lotus
of
the
good
law
one
of
those
who
chant
keeps
time
by
tapping
with
a
mallet
some
grotesque
object
shaped
like
a
dolphin
head
all
lacquered
in
scarlet
and
gold
which
gives
forth
a
dull
booming
tone
a
mokugyo
to
the
right
of
the
temple
is
a
little
shrine
filling
the
air
with
fragrance
of
i
peer
in
through
the
blue
smoke
that
curls
up
from
half
a
dozen
tiny
rods
planted
in
a
small
brazier
full
of
ashes
and
far
back
in
the
shadow
i
see
a
swarthy
buddha
with
head
bowed
and
hands
joined
just
as
i
see
the
japanese
praying
erect
in
the
sun
before
the
thresholds
of
temples
the
figure
is
of
wood
rudely
wrought
and
rudely
coloured
still
the
placid
face
has
beauty
of
suggestion
crossing
the
court
to
the
left
of
the
building
i
find
another
flight
of
steps
before
me
leading
up
a
slope
to
something
mysterious
still
higher
among
enormous
trees
i
ascend
these
steps
also
reach
the
top
guarded
by
two
small
symbolic
lions
and
suddenly
find
myself
in
cool
shadow
and
startled
by
a
spectacle
totally
unfamiliar
dark
almost
black
soil
and
the
shadowing
of
trees
immemorially
old
through
whose
vaulted
foliage
the
sunlight
leaks
thinly
down
in
rare
flecks
a
crepuscular
light
tender
and
solemn
revealing
the
weirdest
host
of
unfamiliar
shapes
a
vast
congregation
of
grey
columnar
mossy
things
stony
monumental
sculptured
with
chinese
ideographs
and
about
them
behind
them
rising
high
above
them
thickly
set
as
rushes
in
a
tall
slender
wooden
tablets
like
laths
covered
with
similar
fantastic
lettering
pierce
the
green
gloom
by
thousands
by
tens
of
thousands
and
before
i
can
note
other
details
i
know
that
i
am
in
a
hakaba
a
cemetery
a
very
ancient
buddhist
cemetery
these
laths
are
called
in
the
japanese
tongue
sotoba
all
have
notches
cut
upon
their
edges
on
both
sides
near
the
notches
and
all
are
painted
with
chinese
characters
on
both
faces
one
inscription
is
always
the
phrase
promote
buddhahood
painted
immediately
below
the
dead
man
name
the
inscription
upon
the
other
surface
is
always
a
sentence
in
sanscrit
whose
meaning
has
been
forgotten
even
by
those
priests
who
perform
the
funeral
rites
one
such
lath
is
planted
behind
the
tomb
as
soon
as
the
monument
haka
is
set
up
then
another
every
seven
days
for
days
then
one
after
the
lapse
of
a
hundred
days
then
one
at
the
end
of
a
year
then
one
after
the
passing
of
three
years
and
at
successively
longer
periods
others
are
erected
during
one
hundred
years
and
in
almost
every
group
i
notice
some
quite
new
or
freshly
planed
unpainted
white
wood
standing
beside
others
grey
or
even
black
with
age
and
there
are
many
still
older
from
whose
surface
all
the
characters
have
disappeared
others
are
lying
on
the
sombre
clay
hundreds
stand
so
loose
in
the
soil
that
the
least
breeze
jostles
and
clatters
them
together
not
less
unfamiliar
in
their
forms
but
far
more
interesting
are
the
monuments
of
stone
one
shape
i
know
represents
five
of
the
buddhist
elements
a
cube
supporting
a
sphere
which
upholds
a
pyramid
on
which
rests
a
shallow
square
cup
with
four
crescent
edges
and
tilted
corners
and
in
the
cup
a
pyriform
body
poised
with
the
point
upwards
these
successively
typify
earth
water
fire
wind
ether
the
five
substances
wherefrom
the
body
is
shapen
and
into
which
it
is
resolved
by
death
the
absence
of
any
emblem
for
the
sixth
element
knowledge
touches
more
than
any
imagery
conceivable
could
do
and
nevertheless
in
the
purpose
of
the
symbolism
this
omission
was
never
planned
with
the
same
idea
that
it
suggests
to
the
occidental
mind
very
numerous
also
among
the
monuments
are
low
square
shafts
with
a
japanese
inscription
in
black
or
gold
or
merely
cut
into
the
stone
itself
then
there
are
upright
slabs
of
various
shapes
and
heights
mostly
rounded
at
the
top
usually
bearing
sculptures
in
relief
finally
there
are
many
curiously
angled
stones
or
natural
rocks
dressed
on
one
side
only
with
designs
etched
upon
the
smoothed
surface
there
would
appear
to
be
some
meaning
even
in
the
irregularity
of
the
shape
of
these
slabs
the
rock
always
seems
to
have
been
broken
out
of
its
bed
at
five
angles
and
the
manner
in
which
it
remains
balanced
perpendicularly
upon
its
pedestal
is
a
secret
that
the
first
hasty
examination
fails
to
reveal
the
pedestals
themselves
vary
in
construction
most
have
three
orifices
in
the
projecting
surface
in
front
of
the
monument
supported
by
them
usually
one
large
oval
cavity
with
two
small
round
holes
flanking
it
these
smaller
holes
serve
for
the
burning
of
the
larger
cavity
is
filled
with
water
i
do
not
know
exactly
why
only
my
japanese
companion
tells
me
is
an
ancient
custom
in
japan
thus
to
pour
out
water
for
the
dead
there
are
also
bamboo
cups
on
either
side
of
the
monument
in
which
to
place
flowers
many
of
the
sculptures
represent
buddha
in
meditation
or
in
the
attitude
of
exhorting
a
few
represent
him
asleep
with
the
placid
dreaming
face
of
a
child
a
japanese
child
this
means
nirvana
a
common
design
upon
many
tombs
also
seems
to
be
two
with
stalks
intertwined
in
one
place
i
see
a
stone
with
an
english
name
upon
it
and
above
that
name
a
rudely
chiselled
cross
verily
the
priests
of
buddha
have
blessed
tolerance
for
this
is
a
christian
tomb
and
all
is
chipped
and
mouldered
and
mossed
and
the
grey
stones
stand
closely
in
hosts
of
ranks
only
one
or
two
inches
apart
ranks
of
thousands
upon
thousands
always
in
the
shadow
of
the
great
trees
overhead
innumerable
birds
sweeten
the
air
with
their
trilling
and
far
below
down
the
steps
behind
us
i
still
hear
the
melancholy
chant
of
the
priests
faintly
like
a
humming
of
bees
akira
leads
the
way
in
silence
to
where
other
steps
descend
into
a
darker
and
older
part
of
the
cemetery
and
at
the
head
of
the
steps
to
the
right
i
see
a
group
of
colossal
monuments
very
tall
massive
mossed
by
time
with
characters
cut
more
than
two
inches
deep
into
the
grey
rock
of
them
and
behind
them
in
lieu
of
laths
are
planted
large
sotoba
twelve
to
fourteen
feet
high
and
thick
as
the
beams
of
a
temple
roof
these
are
graves
of
priests
sec
descending
the
shadowed
steps
i
find
myself
face
to
face
with
six
little
statues
about
three
feet
high
standing
in
a
row
upon
one
long
pedestal
the
first
holds
a
buddhist
the
second
a
lotus
the
third
a
pilgrim
staff
tsue
the
fourth
is
telling
the
beads
of
a
buddhist
rosary
the
fifth
stands
in
the
attitude
of
prayer
with
hands
joined
the
sixth
bears
in
one
hand
the
shakujo
or
mendicant
priest
staff
having
six
rings
attached
to
the
top
of
it
and
in
the
other
hand
the
mystic
jewel
by
virtue
whereof
all
desires
may
be
accomplished
but
the
faces
of
the
six
are
the
same
each
figure
differs
from
the
other
by
the
attitude
only
and
emblematic
attribute
and
all
are
smiling
the
like
faint
smile
about
the
neck
of
each
figure
a
white
cotton
bag
is
suspended
and
all
the
bags
are
filled
with
pebbles
and
pebbles
have
been
piled
high
also
about
the
feet
of
the
statues
and
upon
their
knees
and
upon
their
shoulders
and
even
upon
their
aureoles
of
stone
little
pebbles
are
balanced
archaic
mysterious
but
inexplicably
touching
all
these
soft
childish
faces
are
roku
jizo
six
jizo
these
images
are
called
in
the
speech
of
the
people
and
such
groups
may
be
seen
in
many
a
japanese
cemetery
they
are
representations
of
the
most
beautiful
and
tender
figure
in
japanese
popular
faith
that
charming
divinity
who
cares
for
the
souls
of
little
children
and
consoles
them
in
the
place
of
unrest
and
saves
them
from
the
demons
why
are
those
little
stones
piled
about
the
statues
i
ask
well
it
is
because
some
say
the
must
build
little
towers
of
stones
for
penance
in
the
which
is
the
place
to
which
all
children
after
death
must
go
and
the
oni
who
are
demons
come
to
throw
down
the
little
as
fast
as
the
children
build
and
these
demons
frighten
the
children
and
torment
them
but
the
little
souls
run
to
jizo
who
hides
them
in
his
great
sleeves
and
comforts
them
and
makes
the
demons
go
away
and
every
stone
one
lays
upon
the
knees
or
at
the
feet
of
jizo
with
a
prayer
from
the
heart
helps
some
in
the
to
perform
its
long
penance
little
children
says
the
young
buddhist
student
who
tells
all
this
with
a
smile
as
gentle
as
jizo
own
go
to
the
when
they
die
and
there
they
play
with
jizo
the
is
beneath
us
below
the
ground
jizo
has
long
sleeves
to
his
robe
and
they
pull
him
by
the
sleeves
in
their
play
and
they
pile
up
little
stones
before
him
to
amuse
themselves
and
those
stones
you
see
heaped
about
the
statues
are
put
there
by
people
for
the
sake
of
the
little
ones
most
often
by
mothers
of
dead
children
who
pray
to
jizo
but
grown
people
do
not
go
to
the
when
they
die
and
the
young
student
leaving
the
leads
the
way
to
other
strange
surprises
guiding
me
among
the
tombs
showing
me
the
sculptured
divinities
some
of
them
are
quaintly
touching
all
are
interesting
a
few
are
positively
beautiful
the
greater
number
have
nimbi
many
are
represented
kneeling
with
hands
joined
exactly
like
the
figures
of
saints
in
old
christian
art
others
holding
appear
to
dream
the
dreams
that
are
meditations
one
figure
reposes
on
the
coils
of
a
great
serpent
another
coiffed
with
something
resembling
a
tiara
has
six
hands
one
pair
joined
in
prayer
the
rest
extended
holding
out
various
objects
and
this
figure
stands
upon
a
prostrate
demon
crouching
face
downwards
yet
another
image
cut
in
low
relief
has
arms
innumerable
the
first
pair
of
hands
are
joined
with
the
palms
together
while
from
behind
the
line
of
the
shoulders
as
if
shadowily
emanating
therefrom
multitudinous
arms
reach
out
in
all
directions
vapoury
spiritual
holding
forth
all
kinds
of
objects
as
in
answer
to
supplication
and
symbolising
perhaps
the
omnipotence
of
love
this
is
but
one
of
the
many
forms
of
kwannon
the
goddess
of
mercy
the
gentle
divinity
who
refused
the
rest
of
nirvana
to
save
the
souls
of
men
and
who
is
most
frequently
pictured
as
a
beautiful
japanese
girl
but
here
she
appears
as
close
by
stands
a
great
slab
bearing
upon
the
upper
portion
of
its
chiselled
surface
an
image
in
relief
of
buddha
meditating
upon
a
lotus
and
below
are
carven
three
weird
little
figures
one
with
hands
upon
its
eyes
one
with
hands
upon
its
ears
one
with
hands
upon
its
mouth
these
are
apes
do
they
signify
i
inquire
my
friend
answers
vaguely
mimicking
each
gesture
of
the
three
sculptured
shapes
see
no
bad
thing
i
hear
no
bad
thing
i
speak
no
bad
thing
gradually
by
dint
of
reiterated
explanations
i
myself
learn
to
recognise
some
of
the
gods
at
sight
the
figure
seated
upon
a
lotus
holding
a
sword
in
its
hand
and
surrounded
by
bickering
fire
is
buddha
as
the
unmoved
the
immutable
the
sword
signifies
intellect
the
fire
power
here
is
a
meditating
divinity
holding
in
one
hand
a
coil
of
ropes
the
divinity
is
buddha
those
are
the
ropes
which
bind
the
passions
and
desires
here
also
is
buddha
slumbering
with
the
gentlest
softest
japanese
face
a
child
face
and
eyes
closed
and
hand
pillowing
the
cheek
in
nirvana
here
is
a
beautiful
standing
upon
a
lily
the
japanese
madonna
here
is
a
solemn
seated
figure
holding
in
one
hand
a
vase
and
lifting
the
other
with
the
gesture
of
a
teacher
buddha
the
physician
of
souls
also
i
see
figures
of
animals
the
deer
of
buddhist
stands
all
grace
in
snowy
stone
upon
the
summit
of
toro
or
votive
lamps
on
one
tomb
i
see
superbly
chiselled
the
image
of
a
fish
or
rather
the
idea
of
a
fish
made
beautifully
grotesque
for
sculptural
purposes
like
the
dolphin
of
greek
art
it
crowns
the
top
of
a
memorial
column
the
broad
open
jaws
showing
serrated
teeth
rest
on
the
summit
of
the
block
bearing
the
dead
man
name
the
dorsal
fin
and
elevated
tail
are
elaborated
into
decorative
impossibilities
says
akira
it
is
the
same
buddhist
emblem
as
that
hollow
wooden
object
lacquered
on
which
the
priests
beat
with
a
padded
mallet
while
chanting
the
sutra
and
finally
in
one
place
i
perceive
a
pair
of
sitting
animals
of
some
mythological
species
supple
of
figure
as
greyhounds
says
akira
so
they
are
now
that
i
look
upon
them
with
knowledge
of
their
purpose
idealised
foxes
foxes
spiritualised
impossibly
graceful
foxes
they
are
chiselled
in
some
grey
stone
they
have
long
narrow
sinister
glittering
eyes
they
seem
to
snarl
they
are
weird
very
weird
creatures
the
servants
of
the
retainers
of
and
properly
belong
not
to
buddhist
iconography
but
the
imagery
of
shinto
no
inscriptions
upon
these
tombs
corresponding
to
our
epitaphs
only
family
names
the
names
of
the
dead
and
their
relatives
and
a
sculptured
crest
usually
a
flower
on
the
sotoba
only
sanscrit
words
farther
on
i
find
other
figures
of
jizo
single
reliefs
sculptured
upon
tombs
but
one
of
these
is
a
work
of
art
so
charming
that
i
feel
a
pain
at
being
obliged
to
pass
it
by
more
sweet
assuredly
than
any
imaged
christ
this
dream
in
white
stone
of
the
playfellow
of
dead
children
like
a
beautiful
young
boy
with
gracious
eyelids
half
closed
and
face
made
heavenly
by
such
a
smile
as
only
buddhist
art
could
have
imagined
the
smile
of
infinite
lovingness
and
supremest
gentleness
indeed
so
charming
the
ideal
of
jizo
is
that
in
the
speech
of
the
people
a
beautiful
face
is
always
likened
to
his
as
the
face
of
jizo
sec
and
we
come
to
the
end
of
the
cemetery
to
the
verge
of
the
great
grove
beyond
the
trees
what
caressing
sun
what
spiritual
loveliness
in
the
tender
day
a
tropic
sky
always
seemed
to
me
to
hang
so
low
that
one
could
almost
bathe
one
fingers
in
its
lukewarm
liquid
blue
by
reaching
upward
from
any
but
this
sky
softer
fainter
arches
so
vastly
as
to
suggest
the
heaven
of
a
larger
planet
and
the
very
clouds
are
not
clouds
but
only
dreams
of
clouds
so
filmy
they
are
ghosts
of
clouds
diaphanous
spectres
illusions
all
at
once
i
become
aware
of
a
child
standing
before
me
a
very
young
girl
who
looks
up
wonderingly
at
my
face
so
light
her
approach
that
the
joy
of
the
birds
and
whispering
of
the
leaves
quite
drowned
the
soft
sound
of
her
feet
her
ragged
garb
is
japanese
but
her
gaze
her
loose
fair
hair
are
not
of
nippon
only
the
ghost
of
another
race
perhaps
my
own
watches
me
through
her
eyes
a
strange
playground
surely
is
this
for
thee
my
child
i
wonder
if
all
these
shapes
about
thee
do
not
seem
very
weird
very
strange
to
that
little
soul
of
thine
but
no
is
only
i
who
seem
strange
to
thee
thou
hast
forgotten
the
other
birth
and
thy
father
world
and
poor
and
pretty
in
this
foreign
port
better
thou
wert
with
the
dead
about
thee
child
better
than
the
splendour
of
this
soft
blue
light
the
unknown
darkness
for
thee
there
the
gentle
jizo
would
care
for
thee
and
hide
thee
in
his
great
sleeves
and
keep
all
evil
from
thee
and
play
shadowy
play
with
thee
and
this
thy
forsaken
mother
who
now
comes
to
ask
an
alms
for
thy
sake
dumbly
pointing
to
thy
strange
beauty
with
her
patient
japanese
smile
would
put
little
stones
upon
the
knees
of
the
dear
god
that
thou
mightest
find
rest
sec
akira
you
must
tell
me
something
more
about
jizo
and
the
ghosts
of
the
children
in
the
can
not
tell
you
much
more
answers
akira
smiling
at
my
interest
in
this
charming
divinity
if
you
will
come
with
me
now
to
kuboyama
i
will
show
you
in
one
of
the
temples
there
pictures
of
the
and
of
jizo
and
the
judgment
of
souls
so
we
take
our
way
in
two
jinricksha
to
the
temple
on
kuboyama
we
roll
swiftly
through
a
mile
of
narrow
japanese
streets
then
through
a
of
pretty
suburban
ways
lined
with
gardens
behind
whose
clipped
hedges
are
homes
light
and
dainty
as
cages
of
and
then
leaving
our
vehicles
we
ascend
green
hills
on
foot
by
winding
paths
and
traverse
a
region
of
fields
and
farms
after
a
long
walk
in
the
hot
sun
we
reach
a
village
almost
wholly
composed
of
shrines
and
temples
the
outlying
sacred
place
three
buildings
in
one
enclosure
of
bamboo
fences
belongs
to
the
shingon
sect
a
small
open
shrine
to
the
left
of
the
entrance
first
attracts
us
it
is
a
a
japanese
bier
is
there
but
almost
opposite
the
doorway
is
an
altar
covered
with
startling
images
what
immediately
rivets
the
attention
is
a
terrible
figure
all
vermilion
red
towering
above
many
smaller
images
a
goblin
shape
with
immense
cavernous
eyes
his
mouth
is
widely
opened
as
if
speaking
in
wrath
and
his
brows
frown
terribly
a
long
red
beard
descends
upon
his
red
breast
and
on
his
head
is
a
strangely
shaped
crown
a
crown
of
black
and
gold
having
three
singular
lobes
the
left
lobe
bearing
an
image
of
the
moon
the
right
an
image
of
the
sun
the
central
lobe
is
all
black
but
below
it
upon
the
deep
black
band
flames
the
mystic
character
signifying
king
also
from
the
same
protrude
at
descending
angles
to
left
and
right
two
gilded
objects
in
one
hand
the
king
holds
an
object
similar
of
form
but
larger
his
shaku
or
regal
wand
and
akira
explains
this
is
lord
of
shadows
judge
of
souls
king
of
the
dead
of
any
man
having
a
terrible
countenance
the
japanese
are
wont
to
say
face
is
the
face
of
emma
at
his
right
hand
white
stands
upon
a
rosy
lotus
at
his
left
is
the
image
of
an
aged
woman
weird
she
who
takes
the
garments
of
the
dead
away
by
the
banks
of
the
river
of
the
three
roads
which
flows
through
the
pale
blue
her
robe
is
her
hair
and
skin
are
white
her
face
is
strangely
wrinkled
her
small
keen
eyes
are
hard
the
statue
is
very
old
and
the
paint
is
scaling
from
it
in
places
so
as
to
lend
it
a
ghastly
leprous
aspect
there
are
also
images
of
the
benten
and
of
seated
on
summits
of
mountains
forming
the
upper
part
of
miniature
landscapes
made
of
some
unfamiliar
composition
and
beautifully
coloured
the
whole
being
protected
from
careless
fingering
by
strong
wire
nettings
stretched
across
the
front
of
the
little
shrines
containing
the
panorama
benten
has
eight
arms
two
of
her
hands
are
joined
in
prayer
the
others
extended
above
her
hold
different
objects
a
sword
a
wheel
a
bow
an
arrow
a
key
and
a
magical
gem
below
her
standing
on
the
slopes
of
her
mountain
throne
are
her
ten
robed
attendants
all
in
the
attitude
of
prayer
still
farther
down
appears
the
body
of
a
great
white
serpent
with
its
tail
hanging
from
one
orifice
in
the
rocks
and
its
head
emerging
from
another
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
hill
lies
a
patient
cow
kwannon
appears
as
offering
gifts
to
men
with
all
the
multitude
of
her
arms
of
mercy
but
this
is
not
what
we
came
to
see
the
pictures
of
heaven
and
hell
await
us
in
the
temple
close
by
whither
we
turn
our
steps
on
the
way
my
guide
tells
me
this
one
dies
the
body
is
washed
and
shaven
and
attired
in
white
in
the
garments
of
a
pilgrim
and
a
wallet
sanyabukkero
like
the
wallet
of
a
buddhist
pilgrim
is
hung
about
the
neck
of
the
dead
and
in
this
wallet
are
placed
three
rin
and
these
coin
are
buried
with
the
dead
all
who
die
must
except
children
pay
three
rin
at
the
the
river
of
the
three
roads
when
souls
have
reached
that
river
they
find
there
the
old
woman
of
the
three
roads
waiting
for
them
she
lives
on
the
banks
of
that
river
with
her
husband
ten
and
if
the
old
woman
is
not
paid
the
sum
of
three
rin
she
takes
away
the
clothes
of
the
dead
and
hangs
them
upon
the
trees
sec
the
temple
is
small
neat
luminous
with
the
sun
pouring
into
its
widely
opened
shoji
and
akira
must
know
the
priests
well
so
affable
their
greeting
is
i
make
a
little
offering
and
akira
explains
the
purpose
of
our
visit
thereupon
we
are
invited
into
a
large
bright
apartment
in
a
wing
of
the
building
overlooking
a
lovely
garden
little
cushions
are
placed
on
the
floor
for
us
to
sit
upon
and
a
is
brought
in
and
a
tiny
lacquered
table
about
eight
inches
high
and
while
one
of
the
priests
opens
a
cupboard
or
alcove
with
doors
to
find
the
kakemono
another
brings
us
tea
and
a
plate
of
curious
confectionery
consisting
of
various
pretty
objects
made
of
a
paste
of
sugar
and
rice
flour
one
is
a
perfect
model
of
a
chrysanthemum
blossom
another
is
a
lotus
others
are
simply
large
thin
crimson
lozenges
bearing
admirable
designs
flying
birds
wading
storks
fish
even
miniature
landscapes
akira
picks
out
the
chrysanthemum
and
insists
that
i
shall
eat
it
and
i
begin
to
demolish
the
sugary
blossom
petal
by
petal
feeling
all
the
while
an
acute
remorse
for
spoiling
so
beautiful
a
thing
meanwhile
four
kakemono
have
been
brought
forth
unrolled
and
suspended
from
pegs
upon
the
wall
and
we
rise
to
examine
them
they
are
very
very
beautiful
kakemono
miracles
of
drawing
and
of
colour
the
colour
of
the
best
period
of
japanese
art
and
they
are
very
large
fully
five
feet
long
and
more
than
three
broad
mounted
upon
silk
and
these
are
the
legends
of
them
first
kakemono
in
the
upper
part
of
the
painting
is
a
scene
from
the
shaba
the
world
of
men
which
we
are
wont
to
call
the
real
a
cemetery
with
trees
in
blossom
and
mourners
kneeling
before
tombs
all
under
the
soft
blue
light
of
japanese
day
underneath
is
the
world
of
ghosts
down
through
the
souls
are
descending
here
they
are
flitting
all
white
through
inky
darknesses
here
farther
on
through
weird
twilight
they
are
wading
the
flood
of
the
phantom
river
of
the
three
roads
and
here
on
the
right
is
waiting
for
them
the
old
woman
of
the
three
roads
ghastly
and
grey
and
tall
as
a
nightmare
from
some
she
is
taking
their
garments
the
trees
about
her
are
heavily
hung
with
the
garments
of
others
gone
before
farther
down
i
see
fleeing
souls
overtaken
by
demons
hideous
demons
with
feet
like
lions
with
faces
half
human
half
bovine
the
physiognomy
of
minotaurs
in
fury
one
is
rending
a
soul
asunder
another
demon
is
forcing
souls
to
reincarnate
themselves
in
bodies
of
horses
of
dogs
of
swine
and
as
they
are
thus
reincarnated
they
flee
away
into
shadow
second
kakemono
such
a
gloom
as
the
diver
sees
in
water
a
lurid
twilight
in
the
midst
a
throne
and
upon
it
an
awful
figure
seated
emma
lord
of
death
and
judge
of
souls
unpitying
tremendous
frightful
guardian
spirits
hover
about
him
armed
goblins
on
the
left
in
the
foreground
below
the
throne
stands
the
wondrous
mirror
reflecting
the
state
of
souls
and
all
the
happenings
of
the
world
a
landscape
now
shadows
its
surface
a
landscape
of
cliffs
and
sand
and
sea
with
ships
in
the
offing
upon
the
sand
a
dead
man
is
lying
slain
by
a
sword
slash
the
murderer
is
running
away
before
this
mirror
a
terrified
soul
stands
in
the
grasp
of
a
demon
who
compels
him
to
look
and
to
recognise
in
the
features
his
own
face
to
the
right
of
the
throne
upon
a
flat
stand
such
as
offerings
to
the
gods
are
placed
upon
in
the
temples
a
monstrous
shape
appears
like
a
head
freshly
cut
off
and
set
upright
upon
the
stump
of
the
neck
the
two
faces
are
the
witnesses
the
face
of
the
woman
mirume
sees
all
that
goes
on
in
the
shaba
the
other
face
is
the
face
of
a
bearded
man
the
face
of
kaguhana
who
smells
all
odours
and
by
them
is
aware
of
all
that
human
beings
do
close
to
them
upon
a
a
great
book
is
open
the
of
deeds
and
between
the
mirror
and
the
witnesses
white
shuddering
souls
await
judgment
farther
down
i
see
the
sufferings
of
souls
already
sentenced
one
in
lifetime
a
liar
is
having
his
tongue
torn
out
by
a
demon
armed
with
heated
pincers
other
souls
flung
by
scores
into
fiery
carts
are
being
dragged
away
to
torment
the
carts
are
of
iron
but
resemble
in
form
certain
which
one
sees
every
day
being
pulled
and
pushed
through
the
streets
by
japanese
labourers
chanting
always
the
same
melancholy
alternating
chorus
haidak
hei
haidak
hei
but
these
naked
having
the
feet
of
lions
and
the
heads
of
bulls
move
with
their
flaming
wagons
at
a
run
like
all
the
souls
so
far
represented
are
souls
of
adults
third
kakemono
a
furnace
with
souls
for
fuel
blazing
up
into
darkness
demons
stir
the
fire
with
poles
of
iron
down
through
the
upper
blackness
other
souls
are
falling
head
downward
into
the
flames
below
this
scene
opens
a
shadowy
landscape
a
and
world
of
hills
and
vales
through
which
a
river
serpentines
the
thronging
the
banks
of
the
pale
river
are
ghosts
of
little
children
trying
to
pile
up
stones
they
are
very
very
pretty
the
pretty
as
real
japanese
children
are
it
is
astonishing
how
well
is
felt
and
expressed
by
the
artists
of
japan
each
child
has
one
little
short
white
dress
in
the
foreground
a
horrible
devil
with
an
iron
club
has
just
dashed
down
and
scattered
a
pile
of
stones
built
by
one
of
the
children
the
little
ghost
seated
by
the
ruin
of
its
work
is
crying
with
both
pretty
hands
to
its
eyes
the
devil
appears
to
sneer
other
children
also
are
weeping
near
by
but
lo
jizo
comes
all
light
and
sweetness
with
a
glory
moving
behind
him
like
a
great
full
moon
and
he
holds
out
his
shakujo
his
strong
and
holy
staff
and
the
little
ghosts
catch
it
and
cling
to
it
and
are
drawn
into
the
circle
of
his
protection
and
other
infants
have
caught
his
great
sleeves
and
one
has
been
lifted
to
the
bosom
of
the
god
below
this
scene
appears
yet
another
a
wilderness
of
bamboos
only
shapes
of
women
appear
in
it
they
are
weeping
the
fingers
of
all
are
bleeding
with
plucked
out
must
they
continue
through
centuries
to
pick
the
fourth
kakemono
floating
in
glory
amida
buddha
far
below
them
as
hell
from
heaven
surges
a
lake
of
blood
in
which
souls
float
the
shores
of
this
lake
are
precipices
studded
with
thickly
set
as
teeth
in
the
jaws
of
a
shark
and
demons
are
driving
naked
ghosts
up
the
frightful
slopes
but
out
of
the
crimson
lake
something
crystalline
rises
like
a
beautiful
clear
the
stem
of
a
flower
a
miraculous
lotus
bearing
up
a
soul
to
the
feet
of
a
priest
standing
above
the
verge
of
the
abyss
by
virtue
of
his
prayer
was
shaped
the
lotus
which
thus
lifted
up
and
saved
a
sufferer
alas
there
are
no
other
kakemonos
there
were
several
others
they
have
been
lost
no
i
am
happily
mistaken
the
priest
has
found
in
some
mysterious
recess
one
more
kakemono
a
very
large
one
which
he
unrolls
and
suspends
beside
the
others
a
vision
of
beauty
indeed
but
what
has
this
to
do
with
faith
or
ghosts
in
the
foreground
a
garden
by
the
waters
of
the
sea
of
some
vast
blue
lake
a
garden
like
that
at
kanagawa
full
of
exquisite
miniature
cascades
grottoes
carved
bridges
and
trees
snowy
with
blossom
and
dainty
pavilions
over
the
placid
azure
water
long
bright
soft
bands
of
clouds
swim
athwart
the
background
beyond
and
above
them
rises
a
fairy
magnificence
of
palatial
structures
roof
above
roof
through
an
aureate
haze
like
summer
vapour
creations
aerial
blue
light
as
dreams
and
there
are
guests
in
these
gardens
lovely
beings
japanese
maidens
but
they
wear
aureoles
they
are
spirits
for
this
is
paradise
the
gokuraku
and
all
those
divine
shapes
are
bosatsu
and
now
looking
closer
i
perceive
beautiful
weird
things
which
at
first
escaped
my
notice
they
are
gardening
these
charming
beings
they
are
caressing
the
sprinkling
their
petals
with
something
celestial
helping
them
to
blossom
and
what
with
colours
not
of
this
world
some
have
burst
open
and
in
their
luminous
hearts
in
a
radiance
like
that
of
dawn
tiny
naked
infants
are
seated
each
with
a
tiny
halo
these
are
souls
new
buddhas

ambrosial
i
see
one
which
has
left
its
being
conducted
by
a
celestial

toward
the

splendours
far
away
above

playing
with
an

akira
says
this
heaven
is
too
much
like
earth
the
gardens
he
declares
are
like
the
gardens
of
temples
in
spite
of
the
celestial
and
in
the
blue
roofs
of
the
celestial
mansions
he
discovers
memories
of
the
of
the
city
of
saikyo
well
what
after
all
is
the
heaven
of
any
faith
but
ideal
reiteration
and
prolongation
of
happy
experiences
remembered
the
dream
of
dead
days
resurrected
for
us
and
made
eternal
and
if
you
think
this
japanese
ideal
too
simple
too
naive
if
you
say
there
are
experiences
of
the
material
life
more
worthy
of
portrayal
in
a
picture
of
heaven
than
any
memory
of
days
passed
in
japanese
gardens
and
temples
and
it
is
perhaps
because
you
do
not
know
japan
the
soft
sweet
blue
of
its
sky
the
tender
colour
of
its
waters
the
gentle
splendour
of
its
sunny
days
the
exquisite
charm
of
its
interiors
where
the
least
object
appeals
to
one
sense
of
beauty
with
the
air
of
something
not
made
but
caressed
into
existence
sec
there
is
a
wasan
of
jizo
says
akira
taking
from
a
shelf
in
the
temple
alcove
some
japanese
book
wasan
is
what
you
would
call
a
hymn
or
psalm
this
book
is
two
hundred
years
old
it
is
called
which
is
literally
the
legend
of
the
humming
of
the
and
this
is
the
wasan
and
he
reads
me
the
hymn
of
jizo
the
legend
of
the
murmur
of
the
little
ghosts
the
legend
of
the
humming
of
the
like
a
song
of
this
world
is
the
story
of
sorrow
the
story
of
the
at
the
roots
of
the
mountain
of
shide
not
of
this
world
is
the
tale
yet
is
most
pitiful
to
hear
for
together
in
the
are
assembled
children
of
tender
age
in
multitude
infants
but
two
or
three
years
old
infants
of
four
or
five
infants
of
less
than
ten
in
the
are
they
gathered
together
and
the
voice
of
their
longing
for
their
parents
the
voice
of
their
crying
for
their
mothers
and
their
fathers
chichi
koishi
haha
koishi
is
never
as
the
voice
of
the
crying
of
children
in
this
world
but
a
crying
so
pitiful
to
hear
that
the
sound
of
it
would
pierce
through
flesh
and
bone
and
sorrowful
indeed
the
task
which
they
perform
gathering
the
stones
of
the
bed
of
the
river
therewith
to
heap
the
tower
of
prayers
saying
prayers
for
the
happiness
of
father
they
heap
the
first
tower
saying
prayers
for
the
happiness
of
mother
they
heap
the
second
tower
saying
prayers
for
their
brothers
their
sisters
and
all
whom
they
loved
at
home
they
heap
the
third
tower
such
by
day
are
their
pitiful
diversions
but
ever
as
the
sun
begins
to
sink
below
the
horizon
then
do
the
oni
the
demons
of
the
hells
appear
and
say
to
them
what
is
this
that
you
do
here
lo
your
parents
still
living
in
the
take
no
thought
of
pious
offering
or
holy
work
they
do
nought
but
mourn
for
you
from
the
morning
unto
the
evening
oh
how
pitiful
alas
how
unmerciful
verily
the
cause
of
the
pains
that
you
suffer
is
only
the
mourning
the
lamentation
of
your
parents
and
saying
also
blame
never
us
the
demons
cast
down
the
towers
they
dash
the
stones
down
with
their
clubs
of
iron
but
lo
the
teacher
jizo
appears
all
gently
he
comes
and
says
to
the
weeping
infants
be
not
afraid
dears
be
never
fearful
poor
little
souls
your
lives
were
brief
indeed
too
soon
you
were
forced
to
make
the
weary
journey
to
the
meido
the
long
journey
to
the
region
of
the

trust
to
me
i
am
your
father
and
mother
in
the
meido
father
of
all
children
in
the
region
of
the
dead
and
he
folds
the
skirt
of
his
shining
robe
about
them
so
graciously
takes
he
pity
on
the
infants
to
those
who
can
not

he
stretches
forth
his
strong
shakujo
and
he

the

lies
glorified
in
a
joy

and
yet
a
sense
of
melancholy
of
desolation
unspeakable
weighs
upon
me
as
we
roll
along
the
bank
of
the
tiny
stream
between
the
mouldering
lines
of
wretched
little
homes
with
grass
growing
on
their
roofs
for
this
mouldering
hamlet
represents
all
that
remains
of
the
streets
of
yoritomo
capital
the
mighty
city
of
the
shogunate
the
ancient
seat
of
feudal
power
whither
came
the
envoys
of
kublai
khan
demanding
tribute
to
lose
their
heads
for
their
temerity
and
only
some
of
the
unnumbered
temples
of
the
once
magnificent
city
now
remain
saved
from
the
conflagrations
of
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
doubtless
because
built
in
high
places
or
because
isolated
from
the
maze
of
burning
streets
by
vast
courts
and
groves
here
still
dwell
the
ancient
gods
in
the
great
silence
of
their
decaying
temples
without
worshippers
without
revenues
surrounded
by
desolations
of
where
the
chanting
of
frogs
replaces
the
murmur
of
the
city
that
was
and
is
not
sec
the
first
great
temple
invites
us
to
cross
the
canal
by
a
little
bridge
facing
its
outward
gate
a
roofed
gate
with
fine
chinese
lines
but
without
carving
passing
it
we
ascend
a
long
imposing
succession
of
broad
steps
leading
up
through
a
magnificent
grove
to
a
terrace
where
we
reach
the
second
gate
this
gate
is
a
surprise
a
stupendous
structure
of
two
stories
with
huge
sweeping
curves
of
roof
and
enormous
gables
antique
chinese
magnificent
it
is
more
than
four
hundred
years
old
but
seems
scarcely
affected
by
the
wearing
of
the
centuries
the
whole
of
the
ponderous
and
complicated
upper
structure
is
sustained
upon
an
of
round
plain
pillars
and
the
vast
eaves
are
full
of
and
the
storm
of
twittering
from
the
roofs
is
like
a
rushing
of
water
immense
the
work
is
and
imposing
in
its
aspect
of
settled
power
but
in
its
way
it
has
great
severity
there
are
no
carvings
no
gargoyles
no
dragons
and
yet
the
maze
of
projecting
timbers
below
the
eaves
will
both
excite
and
delude
expectation
so
strangely
does
it
suggest
the
grotesqueries
and
fantasticalities
of
another
art
you
look
everywhere
for
the
heads
of
lions
elephants
dragons
and
see
only
the
ends
of
beams
and
feel
rather
astonished
than
disappointed
the
majesty
of
the
edifice
could
not
have
been
strengthened
by
any
such
carving
after
the
gate
another
long
series
of
wide
steps
and
more
trees
millennial
and
then
the
terrace
of
the
temple
itself
with
two
beautiful
stone
lanterns
toro
at
its
entrance
the
architecture
of
the
temple
resembles
that
of
the
gate
although
on
a
lesser
scale
over
the
doors
is
a
tablet
with
chinese
characters
signifying
pure
clear
shining
treasure
but
a
heavy
framework
of
wooden
bars
closes
the
sanctuary
and
there
is
no
one
to
let
us
in
peering
between
the
bars
i
see
in
a
sort
of
twilight
first
a
pavement
of
squares
of
marble
then
an
aisle
of
massive
wooden
pillars
upholding
the
dim
lofty
roof
and
at
the
farther
end
between
the
pillars
shaka
colossal
enthroned
upon
a
giant
lotus
fully
forty
feet
in
circumference
at
his
right
hand
some
white
mysterious
figure
stands
holding
an
at
his
left
another
white
figure
is
praying
with
clasped
hands
both
are
of
superhuman
stature
but
it
is
too
dark
within
the
edifice
to
discern
who
they
may
be
whether
disciples
of
the
buddha
or
divinities
or
figures
of
saints
beyond
this
temple
extends
an
immense
grove
of
trees
ancient
cedars
and
pines
with
splendid
bamboos
thickly
planted
between
them
rising
perpendicularly
as
masts
to
mix
their
plumes
with
the
foliage
of
the
giants
the
effect
is
tropical
magnificent
through
this
shadowing
a
flight
of
broad
stone
steps
slant
up
gently
to
some
yet
older
shrine
and
ascending
them
we
reach
another
portal
smaller
than
the
imposing
chinese
structure
through
which
we
already
passed
but
wonderful
weird
full
of
dragons
dragons
of
a
form
which
sculptors
no
longer
carve
which
they
have
even
forgotten
how
to
make
winged
dragons
rising
from
a
of
waters
or
thereinto
descending
the
dragon
upon
the
panel
of
the
left
gate
has
her
mouth
closed
the
jaws
of
the
dragon
on
the
panel
of
the
right
gate
are
open
and
menacing
female
and
male
they
are
like
the
lions
of
buddha
and
the
whirls
of
the
eddying
water
and
the
crests
of
the
billowing
stand
out
from
the
panel
in
astonishing
boldness
of
relief
in
loops
and
curlings
of
grey
wood
to
the
hardness
of
stone
the
little
temple
beyond
contains
no
celebrated
image
but
a
shari
only
or
relic
of
buddha
brought
from
india
and
i
can
not
see
it
having
no
time
to
wait
until
the
absent
keeper
of
the
shari
can
be
found
sec
we
shall
go
to
look
at
the
big
bell
says
akira
we
turn
to
the
left
as
we
descend
along
a
path
cut
between
hills
faced
for
the
height
of
seven
or
eight
feet
with
made
green
by
moss
and
reach
a
flight
of
extraordinarily
dilapidated
steps
with
grass
springing
between
their
every
joint
and
break
steps
so
worn
down
and
displaced
by
countless
feet
that
they
have
become
ruins
painful
and
even
dangerous
to
mount
we
reach
the
summit
however
without
mishap
and
find
ourselves
before
a
little
temple
on
the
steps
of
which
an
old
priest
awaits
us
with
smiling
bow
of
welcome
we
return
his
salutation
but
ere
entering
the
temple
turn
to
look
at
the
tsurigane
on
the
right
the
famous
bell
under
a
lofty
open
shed
with
a
tilted
chinese
roof
the
great
bell
is
hung
i
should
judge
it
to
be
fully
nine
feet
high
and
about
five
feet
in
diameter
with
lips
about
eight
inches
thick
the
shape
of
it
is
not
like
that
of
our
bells
which
broaden
toward
the
lips
this
has
the
same
diameter
through
all
its
height
and
it
is
covered
with
buddhist
texts
cut
into
the
smooth
metal
of
it
it
is
rung
by
means
of
a
heavy
swinging
beam
suspended
from
the
roof
by
chains
and
moved
like
a
there
are
loops
of
rope
attached
to
this
beam
to
pull
it
by
and
when
you
pull
hard
enough
so
as
to
give
it
a
good
swing
it
strikes
a
moulding
like
a
on
the
side
of
the
bell
this
it
must
have
done
many
hundred
times
for
the
square
flat
end
of
it
though
showing
the
grain
of
a
very
dense
wood
has
been
battered
into
a
convex
disk
with
ragged
protruding
edges
like
the
surface
of
a
printer
mallet
a
priest
makes
a
sign
to
me
to
ring
the
bell
i
first
touch
the
great
lips
with
my
hand
very
lightly
and
a
musical
murmur
comes
from
them
then
i
set
the
beam
swinging
strongly
and
a
sound
deep
as
thunder
rich
as
the
bass
of
a
mighty
organ
a
sound
enormous
extraordinary
yet
beautiful
rolls
over
the
hills
and
away
then
swiftly
follows
another
and
lesser
and
sweeter
billowing
of
tone
then
another
then
an
eddying
of
waves
of
echoes
only
once
was
it
struck
the
astounding
bell
yet
it
continues
to
sob
and
moan
for
at
least
ten
minutes
and
the
age
of
this
bell
is
six
hundred
and
fifty
years
in
the
little
temple
near
by
the
priest
shows
us
a
series
of
curious
paintings
representing
the
six
hundredth
anniversary
of
the
casting
of
the
bell
for
this
is
a
sacred
bell
and
the
spirit
of
a
god
is
believed
to
dwell
within
it
otherwise
the
temple
has
little
of
interest
there
are
some
kakemono
representing
iyeyasu
and
his
retainers
and
on
either
side
of
the
door
separating
the
inner
from
the
outward
sanctuary
there
are
images
of
japanese
warriors
in
antique
costume
on
the
altars
of
the
inner
shrine
are
small
images
grouped
upon
a
miniature
of
painted
wood
the
or
fifteen
youths
the
sons
of
the
goddess
benten
there
are
gohei
before
the
shrine
and
a
mirror
upon
it
emblems
of
shinto
the
sanctuary
has
changed
hands
in
the
great
transfer
of
buddhist
temples
to
the
state
religion
in
nearly
every
celebrated
temple
little
japanese
prints
are
sold
containing
the
history
of
the
shrine
and
its
miraculous
legends
i
find
several
such
things
on
sale
at
the
door
of
the
temple
and
in
one
of
them
ornamented
with
a
curious
engraving
of
the
bell
i
discover
with
akira
aid
the
following
traditions
sec
in
the
twelfth
year
of
bummei
this
bell
rang
itself
and
one
who
laughed
on
being
told
of
the
miracle
met
with
misfortune
and
another
who
believed
thereafter
prospered
and
obtained
all
his
desires
now
in
that
time
there
died
in
the
village
of
tamanawa
a
sick
man
whose
name
was
and
descended
to
the
region
of
the
dead
and
went
before
the
of
and
emma
judge
of
souls
said
to
him
come
too
soon
the
measure
of
life
allotted
you
in
the
has
not
yet
been
exhausted
go
back
at
once
but
pleaded
saying
may
i
go
back
not
knowing
my
way
through
the
darkness
and
emma
answered
him
can
find
your
way
back
by
listening
to
the
sound
of
the
bell
of
which
is
heard
in
the
world
going
south
and
went
south
and
heard
the
bell
and
found
his
way
through
the
darknesses
and
revived
in
the
also
in
those
days
there
appeared
in
many
provinces
a
buddhist
priest
of
giant
stature
whom
none
remembered
to
have
seen
before
and
whose
name
no
man
knew
travelling
through
the
land
and
everywhere
exhorting
the
people
to
pray
before
the
bell
of
and
it
was
at
last
discovered
that
the
giant
pilgrim
was
the
holy
bell
itself
transformed
by
supernatural
power
into
the
form
of
a
priest
and
after
these
things
had
happened
many
prayed
before
the
bell
and
obtained
their
wishes
sec
there
is
something
still
to
see
my
guide
exclaims
as
we
reach
the
great
chinese
gate
again
and
he
leads
the
way
across
the
grounds
by
another
path
to
a
little
hill
previously
hidden
from
view
by
trees
the
face
of
the
hill
a
mass
of
soft
stone
perhaps
one
hundred
feet
high
is
hollowed
out
into
chambers
full
of
images
these
look
like
and
the
images
seem
funereal
monuments
there
are
two
stories
of
chambers
three
above
two
below
and
the
former
are
connected
with
the
latter
by
a
narrow
interior
stairway
cut
through
the
living
rock
and
all
around
the
dripping
walls
of
these
chambers
on
pedestals
are
grey
slabs
shaped
exactly
like
the
haka
in
buddhist
cemeteries
and
chiselled
with
figures
of
divinities
in
high
relief
all
have
some
are
naive
and
sincere
like
the
work
of
our
own
mediaeval
several
are
not
unfamiliar
i
have
seen
before
in
the
cemetery
of
kuboyama
this
kneeling
woman
with
countless
shadowy
hands
and
this
figure
slumbering
with
one
knee
raised
and
cheek
pillowed
upon
the
left
hand
the
placid
and
pathetic
symbol
of
the
perpetual
rest
others
like
madonnas
hold
and
their
feet
rest
upon
the
coils
of
a
serpent
i
can
not
see
them
all
for
the
rock
roof
of
one
chamber
has
fallen
in
and
a
sunbeam
entering
the
ruin
reveals
a
host
of
inaccessible
sculptures
half
buried
in
rubbish
but
no
this
is
not
for
the
dead
and
these
are
not
haka
as
i
imagined
but
only
images
of
the
goddess
of
mercy
these
chambers
are
chapels
and
these
sculptures
are
the
hundred
kwannons
of
and
i
see
in
the
upper
chamber
above
the
stairs
a
granite
tablet
in
a
chiselled
with
an
inscription
in
sanscrit
transliterated
into
chinese
characters
to
the
great
merciful
who
looketh
down
above
the
sound
of
prayer
sec
entering
the
grounds
of
the
next
temple
the
temple
of
through
the
of
the
forest
of
contemplative
words
and
the
of
the
great
mountain
of
wealth
one
might
almost
fancy
one
self
reentering
by
some
queer
mistake
the
grounds
of
for
the
third
gate
before
us
and
the
imposing
temple
beyond
it
constructed
upon
the
same
models
as
those
of
the
structures
previously
visited
were
also
the
work
of
the
same
architect
passing
this
third
gate
colossal
severe
superb
we
come
to
a
fountain
of
bronze
before
the
temple
doors
an
immense
and
beautiful
of
metal
forming
a
broad
shallow
basin
kept
full
to
the
brim
by
a
jet
in
its
midst
this
temple
also
is
paved
with
black
and
white
square
slabs
and
we
can
enter
it
with
our
shoes
outside
it
is
plain
and
solemn
as
that
of
but
the
interior
offers
a
more
extraordinary
spectacle
of
faded
splendour
in
lieu
of
the
black
shaka
throned
against
a
background
of
flamelets
is
a
colossal
with
a
nimbus
of
fire
a
single
gilded
circle
large
as
a
breaking
into
at
three
points
he
is
seated
upon
an
enormous
lotus
of
tarnished
gold
over
the
lofty
edge
of
which
the
skirt
of
his
robe
trails
down
behind
him
standing
on
ascending
tiers
of
golden
steps
are
glimmering
hosts
of
miniature
figures
of
him
reflections
multiplications
of
him
ranged
there
by
ranks
of
hundreds
the
thousand
jizo
from
the
ceiling
above
him
droop
the
dingy
splendours
of
a
sort
of
a
streaming
circle
of
pendants
like
a
fringe
shimmering
faintly
through
the
webbed
dust
of
centuries
and
the
ceiling
itself
must
once
have
been
a
marvel
all
beamed
in
caissons
each
caisson
containing
upon
a
gold
ground
the
painted
figure
of
a
flying
bird
formerly
the
eight
great
pillars
supporting
the
roof
were
also
covered
with
gilding
but
only
a
few
traces
of
it
linger
still
upon
their
surfaces
and
about
the
bases
of
their
capitals
and
there
are
wonderful
friezes
above
the
doors
from
which
all
colour
has
long
since
faded
away
marvellous
grey
old
carvings
in
relief
floating
figures
of
tennin
or
heavenly
spirits
playing
upon
flutes
and
biwa
there
is
a
chamber
separated
by
a
heavy
wooden
screen
from
the
aisle
on
the
right
and
the
priest
in
charge
of
the
building
slides
the
screen
aside
and
bids
us
enter
in
this
chamber
is
a
drum
elevated
upon
a
brazen
stand
the
hugest
i
ever
saw
fully
eighteen
feet
in
circumference
beside
it
hangs
a
big
bell
covered
with
buddhist
texts
i
am
sorry
to
learn
that
it
is
prohibited
to
sound
the
great
drum
there
is
nothing
else
to
see
except
some
dingy
paper
lanterns
figured
with
the
svastika
the
sacred
buddhist
symbol
called
by
the
japanese
manji
sec
akira
tells
me
that
in
the
book
called
this
legend
is
related
of
the
great
statue
of
jizo
in
this
same
ancient
temple
of
formerly
there
lived
at
kamakura
the
wife
of
a
ronin
named
soga
sadayoshi
she
lived
by
feeding
silkworms
and
gathering
the
silk
she
used
often
to
visit
the
temple
of
and
one
very
cold
day
that
she
went
there
she
thought
that
the
image
of
jizo
looked
like
one
suffering
from
cold
and
she
resolved
to
make
a
cap
to
keep
the
head
warm
such
a
cap
as
the
people
of
the
country
wear
in
cold
weather
and
she
went
home
and
made
the
cap
and
covered
the
god
head
with
it
saying
i
were
rich
enough
to
give
thee
a
warm
covering
for
all
thine
august
body
but
alas
i
am
poor
and
even
this
which
i
offer
thee
is
unworthy
of
thy
divine
acceptance
now
this
woman
very
suddenly
died
in
the
fiftieth
year
of
her
age
in
the
twelfth
month
of
the
fifth
year
of
the
period
called
chisho
but
her
body
remained
warm
for
three
days
so
that
her
relatives
would
not
suffer
her
to
be
taken
to
the
and
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
she
came
to
life
again
then
she
related
that
on
the
day
of
her
death
she
had
gone
before
the
of
emma
king
and
judge
of
the
dead
and
emma
seeing
her
became
wroth
and
said
to
her
have
been
a
wicked
woman
and
have
scorned
the
teaching
of
the
buddha
all
your
life
you
have
passed
in
destroying
the
lives
of
silkworms
by
putting
them
into
heated
water
now
you
shall
go
to
the
and
there
burn
until
your
sins
shall
be
expiated
forthwith
she
was
seized
and
dragged
by
demons
to
a
great
pot
filled
with
molten
metal
and
thrown
into
the
pot
and
she
cried
out
horribly
and
suddenly
descended
into
the
molten
metal
beside
her
and
the
metal
became
like
a
flowing
of
oil
and
ceased
to
burn
and
jizo
put
his
arms
about
her
and
lifted
her
out
and
he
went
with
her
before
king
emma
and
asked
that
she
should
be
pardoned
for
his
sake
forasmuch
as
she
had
become
related
to
him
by
one
act
of
goodness
so
she
found
pardon
and
returned
to
the
i
ask
can
not
then
be
lawful
according
to
buddhism
for
any
one
to
wear
silk
not
replies
akira
by
the
law
of
buddha
priests
are
expressly
forbidden
to
wear
silk
nevertheless
he
adds
with
that
quiet
smile
of
his
in
which
i
am
beginning
to
discern
suggestions
of
sarcasm
all
the
priests
wear
silk
sec
akira
also
tells
me
this
it
is
related
in
the
seventh
volume
of
the
book
kamakurashi
that
there
was
formerly
at
kamakura
a
temple
called
in
which
there
was
enshrined
a
famous
statue
of
jizo
called
or
naked
jizo
the
statue
was
indeed
naked
but
clothes
were
put
upon
it
and
it
stood
upright
with
its
feet
upon
a
chessboard
now
when
pilgrims
came
to
the
temple
and
paid
a
certain
fee
the
priest
of
the
temple
would
remove
the
clothes
of
the
statue
and
then
all
could
see
that
though
the
face
was
the
face
of
jizo
the
body
was
the
body
of
a
woman
now
this
was
the
origin
of
the
famous
image
of
standing
upon
the
chessboard
on
one
occasion
the
great
prince
was
playing
chess
with
his
wife
in
the
presence
of
many
guests
and
he
made
her
agree
after
they
had
played
several
games
that
whosoever
should
lose
the
next
game
would
have
to
stand
naked
on
the
chessboard
and
in
the
next
game
they
played
his
wife
lost
and
she
prayed
to
jizo
to
save
her
from
the
shame
of
appearing
naked
and
jizo
came
in
answer
to
her
prayer
and
stood
upon
the
chessboard
and
disrobed
himself
and
changed
his
body
suddenly
into
the
body
of
a
woman
sec
as
we
travel
on
the
road
curves
and
narrows
between
higher
elevations
and
becomes
more
sombre
mat
my
buddhist
guide
calls
softly
to
the
runners
and
our
two
vehicles
halt
in
a
band
of
sunshine
descending
through
an
opening
in
the
foliage
of
immense
trees
over
a
flight
of
ancient
mossy
steps
says
my
friend
the
temple
of
the
king
of
death
it
is
called
and
it
is
a
temple
of
the
zen
sect
and
it
is
more
than
seven
hundred
years
old
and
there
is
a
famous
statue
in
it
we
ascend
to
a
small
narrow
court
in
which
the
edifice
stands
at
the
head
of
the
steps
to
the
right
is
a
stone
tablet
very
old
with
characters
cut
at
least
an
inch
deep
into
the
granite
of
it
chinese
characters
signifying
is
the
temple
of
emma
king
the
temple
resembles
outwardly
and
inwardly
the
others
we
have
visited
and
like
those
of
shaka
and
of
the
colossal
jizo
of
kamakura
has
a
paved
floor
so
that
we
are
not
obliged
to
remove
our
shoes
on
entering
everything
is
worn
dim
vaguely
grey
there
is
a
pungent
scent
of
mouldiness
the
paint
has
long
ago
peeled
away
from
the
naked
wood
of
the
pillars
throned
to
right
and
left
against
the
high
walls
tower
nine
grim
figures
five
on
one
side
four
on
the
other
wearing
strange
crowns
with
ornaments
figures
hoary
with
centuries
and
so
like
to
the
icon
of
emma
which
i
saw
at
kuboyama
that
i
ask
all
these
emma
no
my
guide
answers
are
his
attendants
only
the
the
ten
kings
there
are
only
nine
i
query
and
emma
completes
the
number
you
have
not
yet
seen
emma
where
is
he
i
see
at
the
farther
end
of
the
chamber
an
altar
elevated
upon
a
platform
approached
by
wooden
steps
but
there
is
no
image
only
the
usual
altar
furniture
of
gilded
bronze
and
behind
the
altar
i
see
only
a
curtain
about
six
feet
square
a
curtain
once
dark
red
now
almost
without
any
definite
hue
probably
veiling
some
alcove
a
temple
guardian
approaches
and
invites
us
to
ascend
the
platform
i
remove
my
shoes
before
mounting
upon
the
matted
surface
and
follow
the
guardian
behind
the
altar
in
front
of
the
curtain
he
makes
me
a
sign
to
look
and
lifts
the
veil
with
a
long
rod
and
suddenly
out
of
the
blackness
of
some
mysterious
profundity
masked
by
that
sombre
curtain
there
glowers
upon
me
an
apparition
at
the
sight
of
which
i
involuntarily
start
back
a
monstrosity
exceeding
all
anticipation
a
face
a
face
tremendous
menacing
frightful
dull
red
as
with
the
redness
of
heated
iron
cooling
into
grey
the
first
shock
of
the
vision
is
no
doubt
partly
due
to
the
somewhat
theatrical
manner
in
which
the
work
is
suddenly
revealed
out
of
darkness
by
the
lifting
of
the
curtain
but
as
the
surprise
passes
i
begin
to
recognise
the
immense
energy
of
the
conception
to
look
for
the
secret
of
the
grim
artist
the
wonder
of
the
creation
is
not
in
the
tiger
frown
nor
in
the
violence
of
the
terrific
mouth
nor
in
the
fury
and
ghastly
colour
of
the
head
as
a
whole
it
is
in
the
eyes
eyes
of
nightmare
sec
now
this
weird
old
temple
has
its
legend
seven
hundred
years
ago
is
said
there
died
the
great
the
great
busshi
and
signifies
who
returned
from
the
dead
for
when
he
came
before
emma
the
judge
of
souls
emma
said
to
him
thou
madest
no
image
of
me
go
back
unto
earth
and
make
one
now
that
thou
hast
looked
upon
me
and
unke
found
himself
suddenly
restored
to
the
world
of
men
and
they
that
had
known
him
before
astonished
to
see
him
alive
again
called
him
and
bearing
with
him
always
the
memory
of
the
countenance
of
emma
wrought
this
image
of
him
which
still
inspires
fear
in
all
who
behold
it
and
he
made
also
the
images
of
the
grim
the
ten
kings
obeying
emma
which
sit
throned
about
the
temple
i
want
to
buy
a
picture
of
emma
and
make
my
wish
known
to
the
temple
guardian
oh
yes
i
may
buy
a
picture
of
emma
but
i
must
first
see
the
oni
i
follow
the
guardian
out
of
the
temple
down
the
mossy
steps
and
across
the
village
highway
into
a
little
japanese
cottage
where
i
take
my
seat
upon
the
floor
the
guardian
disappears
behind
a
screen
and
presently
returns
dragging
with
him
the
oni
the
image
of
a
demon
naked
indescribably
ugly
the
oni
is
about
three
feet
high
he
stands
in
an
attitude
of
menace
brandishing
a
club
he
has
a
head
shaped
something
like
the
head
of
a
bulldog
with
brazen
eyes
and
his
feet
are
like
the
feet
of
a
lion
very
gravely
the
guardian
turns
the
grotesquery
round
and
round
that
i
may
admire
its
every
aspect
while
a
naive
crowd
collects
before
the
open
door
to
look
at
the
stranger
and
the
demon
then
the
guardian
finds
me
a
rude
woodcut
of
emma
with
a
sacred
inscription
printed
upon
it
and
as
soon
as
i
have
paid
for
it
he
proceeds
to
stamp
the
paper
with
the
seal
of
the
temple
the
seal
he
keeps
in
a
wonderful
lacquered
box
covered
with
many
wrappings
of
soft
leather
these
having
been
removed
i
inspect
the
seal
an
oblong
polished
stone
with
the
design
cut
in
intaglio
upon
it
he
moistens
the
surface
with
red
ink
presses
it
upon
the
corner
of
the
paper
bearing
the
grim
picture
and
the
authenticity
of
my
strange
purchase
is
established
for
ever
sec
you
do
not
see
the
as
you
enter
the
grounds
of
his
temple
and
proceed
along
a
paved
path
across
stretches
of
lawn
great
trees
hide
him
but
very
suddenly
at
a
turn
he
comes
into
full
view
and
you
start
no
matter
how
many
photographs
of
the
colossus
you
may
have
already
seen
this
first
vision
of
the
reality
is
an
astonishment
then
you
imagine
that
you
are
already
too
near
though
the
image
is
at
least
a
hundred
yards
away
as
for
me
i
retire
at
once
thirty
or
forty
yards
back
to
get
a
better
view
and
the
jinricksha
man
runs
after
me
laughing
and
gesticulating
thinking
that
i
imagine
the
image
alive
and
am
afraid
of
it
but
even
were
that
shape
alive
none
could
be
afraid
of
it
the
gentleness
the
dreamy
passionlessness
of
those
features
the
immense
repose
of
the
whole
figure
are
full
of
beauty
and
charm
and
contrary
to
all
expectation
the
nearer
you
approach
the
giant
buddha
the
greater
this
charm
becomes
you
look
up
into
the
solemnly
beautiful
face
into
the
eyes
that
seem
to
watch
you
through
their
eyelids
of
bronze
as
gently
as
those
of
a
child
and
you
feel
that
the
image
typifies
all
that
is
tender
and
calm
in
the
soul
of
the
east
yet
you
feel
also
that
only
japanese
thought
could
have
created
it
its
beauty
its
dignity
its
perfect
repose
reflect
the
higher
life
of
the
race
that
imagined
it
and
though
doubtless
inspired
by
some
indian
model
as
the
treatment
of
the
hair
and
various
symbolic
marks
reveal
the
art
is
japanese
so
mighty
and
beautiful
the
work
is
that
you
will
not
for
some
time
notice
the
magnificent
of
bronze
fully
fifteen
feet
high
planted
before
the
figure
on
either
side
of
the
great
tripod
in
which
are
burning
through
an
orifice
in
the
right
side
of
the
enormous
on
which
the
buddha
is
seated
you
can
enter
into
the
statue
the
interior
contains
a
little
shrine
of
kwannon
and
a
statue
of
the
priest
yuten
and
a
stone
tablet
bearing
in
chinese
characters
the
sacred
formula
namu
amida
butsu
a
ladder
enables
the
pilgrim
to
ascend
into
the
interior
of
the
colossus
as
high
as
the
shoulders
in
which
are
two
little
windows
commanding
a
wide
prospect
of
the
grounds
while
a
priest
who
acts
as
guide
states
the
age
of
the
statue
to
be
six
hundred
and
thirty
years
and
asks
for
some
small
contribution
to
aid
in
the
erection
of
a
new
temple
to
shelter
it
from
the
weather
for
this
buddha
once
had
a
temple
a
tidal
wave
following
an
earthquake
swept
walls
and
roof
away
but
left
the
mighty
amida
unmoved
still
meditating
upon
his
lotus
sec
and
we
arrive
before
the
kamakura
temple
of
kwannon
kwannon
who
yielded
up
her
right
to
the
eternal
peace
that
she
might
save
the
souls
of
men
and
renounced
nirvana
to
suffer
with
humanity
for
other
myriad
million
ages
kwannon
the
goddess
of
pity
and
of
mercy
i
climb
three
flights
of
steps
leading
to
the
temple
and
a
young
girl
seated
at
the
threshold
rises
to
greet
us
then
she
disappears
within
the
temple
to
summon
the
guardian
priest
a
venerable
man
who
makes
me
a
sign
to
enter
the
temple
is
large
as
any
that
i
have
yet
seen
and
like
the
others
grey
with
the
wearing
of
six
hundred
years
from
the
roof
there
hang
down
votive
offerings
inscriptions
and
lanterns
in
multitude
painted
with
various
pleasing
colours
almost
opposite
to
the
entrance
is
a
singular
statue
a
seated
figure
of
human
dimensions
and
most
human
aspect
looking
upon
us
with
small
weird
eyes
set
in
a
wondrously
wrinkled
face
this
face
was
originally
painted
and
the
robes
of
the
image
pale
blue
but
now
the
whole
is
uniformly
grey
with
age
and
dust
and
its
colourlessness
harmonises
so
well
with
the
senility
of
the
figure
that
one
is
almost
ready
to
believe
one
self
gazing
at
a
living
mendicant
pilgrim
it
is
benzuru
the
same
personage
whose
famous
image
at
asakusa
has
been
made
featureless
by
the
wearing
touch
of
countless
to
left
and
right
of
the
entrance
are
the
enormously
muscled
furious
of
aspect
their
crimson
bodies
are
speckled
with
a
white
scum
of
paper
pellets
spat
at
them
by
worshippers
above
the
altar
is
a
small
but
very
pleasing
image
of
kwannon
with
her
entire
figure
relieved
against
an
oblong
halo
of
gold
imitating
the
flickering
of
flame
but
this
is
not
the
image
for
which
the
temple
is
famed
there
is
another
to
be
seen
upon
certain
conditions
the
old
priest
presents
me
with
a
petition
written
in
excellent
and
eloquent
english
praying
visitors
to
contribute
something
to
the
maintenance
of
the
temple
and
its
pontiff
and
appealing
to
those
of
another
faith
to
remember
that
belief
which
can
make
men
kindly
and
good
is
worthy
of
respect
i
contribute
my
mite
and
i
ask
to
see
the
great
kwannon
then
the
old
priest
lights
a
lantern
and
leads
the
way
through
a
low
doorway
on
the
left
of
the
altar
into
the
interior
of
the
temple
into
some
very
lofty
darkness
i
follow
him
cautiously
awhile
discerning
nothing
whatever
but
the
flicker
of
the
lantern
then
we
halt
before
something
which
gleams
a
moment
and
my
eyes
becoming
more
accustomed
to
the
darkness
begin
to
distinguish
outlines
the
gleaming
object
defines
itself
gradually
as
a
foot
an
immense
golden
foot
and
i
perceive
the
hem
of
a
golden
robe
undulating
over
the
instep
now
the
other
foot
appears
the
figure
is
certainly
standing
i
can
perceive
that
we
are
in
a
narrow
but
also
very
lofty
chamber
and
that
out
of
some
mysterious
blackness
overhead
ropes
are
dangling
down
into
the
circle
of
illuminating
the
golden
feet
the
priest
lights
two
more
lanterns
and
suspends
them
upon
hooks
attached
to
a
pair
of
pendent
ropes
about
a
yard
apart
then
he
pulls
up
both
together
slowly
more
of
the
golden
robe
is
revealed
as
the
lanterns
ascend
swinging
on
their
way
then
the
outlines
of
two
mighty
knees
then
the
curving
of
columnar
thighs
under
chiselled
drapery
and
as
with
the
still
waving
ascent
of
the
lanterns
the
golden
vision
towers
ever
higher
through
the
gloom
expectation
intensifies
there
is
no
sound
but
the
sound
of
the
invisible
pulleys
overhead
which
squeak
like
bats
now
above
the
golden
girdle
the
suggestion
of
a
bosom
then
the
glowing
of
a
golden
hand
uplifted
in
benediction
then
another
golden
hand
holding
a
lotus
and
at
last
a
face
golden
smiling
with
eternal
youth
and
infinite
tenderness
the
face
of
kwannon
so
revealed
out
of
the
consecrated
darkness
this
ideal
of
divine
feminity
creation
of
a
forgotten
art
and
time
is
more
than
impressive
i
can
scarcely
call
the
emotion
which
it
produces
admiration
it
is
rather
reverence
but
the
lanterns
which
paused
awhile
at
the
level
of
the
beautiful
face
now
ascend
still
higher
with
a
fresh
squeaking
of
pulleys
and
lo
the
tiara
of
the
divinity
appears
with
strangest
symbolism
it
is
a
pyramid
of
heads
of
faces
of
maidens
miniature
faces
of
kwannon
herself
for
this
is
the
kwannon
of
the
eleven
faces
sec
most
sacred
this
statue
is
held
and
this
is
its
legend
in
the
reign
of
emperor
gensei
there
lived
in
the
province
of
yamato
a
buddhist
priest
tokudo
shonin
who
had
been
in
a
previous
birth
hold
bosatsu
but
had
been
reborn
among
common
men
to
save
their
souls
now
at
that
time
in
a
valley
in
yamato
tokudo
shonin
walking
by
night
saw
a
wonderful
radiance
and
going
toward
it
found
that
it
came
from
the
trunk
of
a
great
fallen
tree
a
kusunoki
or
a
delicious
perfume
came
from
the
tree
and
the
shining
of
it
was
like
the
shining
of
the
moon
and
by
these
signs
tokudo
shonin
knew
that
the
wood
was
holy
and
he
bethought
him
that
he
should
have
the
statue
of
kwannon
carved
from
it
and
he
recited
a
sutra
and
repeated
the
nenbutsu
praying
for
inspiration
and
even
while
he
prayed
there
came
and
stood
before
him
an
aged
man
and
an
aged
woman
and
these
said
to
him
know
that
your
desire
is
to
have
the
image
of
carved
from
this
tree
with
the
help
of
heaven
continue
therefore
to
pray
and
we
shall
carve
the
statue
and
tokudo
shonin
did
as
they
bade
him
and
he
saw
them
easily
split
the
vast
trunk
into
two
equal
parts
and
begin
to
carve
each
of
the
parts
into
an
image
and
he
saw
them
so
labour
for
three
days
and
on
the
third
day
the
work
was
done
and
he
saw
the
two
marvellous
statues
of
kwannon
made
perfect
before
him
and
he
said
to
the
strangers
me
i
pray
you
by
what
names
you
are
known
then
the
old
man
answered
am
kasuga
myojin
and
the
woman
answered
am
called
i
am
the
goddess
of
the
sun
and
as
they
spoke
both
became
transfigured
and
ascended
to
heaven
and
vanished
from
the
sight
of
tokudo
shonin
and
the
emperor
hearing
of
these
happenings
sent
his
representative
to
yamato
to
make
offerings
and
to
have
a
temple
built
also
the
great
priest
came
and
consecrated
the
images
and
dedicated
the
temple
which
by
order
of
the
emperor
was
built
and
one
of
the
statues
he
placed
in
the
temple
enshrining
it
and
commanding
it
thou
here
always
to
save
all
living
creatures
but
the
other
statue
he
cast
into
the
sea
saying
to
it
thou
whithersoever
it
is
best
to
save
all
the
living
now
the
statue
floated
to
kamakura
and
there
arriving
by
night
it
shed
a
great
radiance
all
about
it
as
if
there
were
sunshine
upon
the
sea
and
the
fishermen
of
kamakura
were
awakened
by
the
great
light
and
they
went
out
in
boats
and
found
the
statue
floating
and
brought
it
to
shore
and
the
emperor
ordered
that
a
temple
should
be
built
for
it
the
temple
called
on
the
mountain
called
at
kamakura
sec
as
we
leave
the
temple
of
kwannon
behind
us
there
are
no
more
dwellings
visible
along
the
road
the
green
slopes
to
left
and
right
become
steeper
and
the
shadows
of
the
great
trees
deepen
over
us
but
still
at
intervals
some
flight
of
venerable
mossy
steps
a
carven
buddhist
gateway
or
a
lofty
torii
signals
the
presence
of
sanctuaries
we
have
no
time
to
visit
countless
crumbling
shrines
are
all
around
us
dumb
witnesses
to
the
antique
splendour
and
vastness
of
the
dead
capital
and
everywhere
mingled
with
perfume
of
blossoms
hovers
the
sweet
resinous
smell
of
japanese
incense
we
pass
a
scattered
multitude
of
sculptured
stones
like
segments
of
pillars
old
haka
the
forgotten
tombs
of
a
cemetery
or
the
solitary
image
of
some
buddhist
deity
a
dreaming
amida
or
faintly
smiling
kwannon
all
are
ancient
mutilated
a
few
have
been
into
unrecognisability
i
halt
a
moment
to
contemplate
something
pathetic
a
group
of
six
images
of
the
charming
divinity
who
cares
for
the
ghosts
of
little
children
the
oh
how
chipped
and
scurfed
and
mossed
they
are
five
stand
buried
almost
up
to
their
shoulders
in
a
heaping
of
little
stones
testifying
to
the
prayers
of
generations
and
votive
yodarekake
infant
bibs
of
divers
colours
have
been
put
about
the
necks
of
these
for
the
love
of
children
lost
but
one
of
the
gentle
god
images
lies
shattered
and
overthrown
in
its
own
scattered
perhaps
by
some
passing
wagon
sec
the
road
slopes
before
us
as
we
go
sinks
down
between
cliffs
steep
as
the
walls
of
a
canyon
and
curves
suddenly
we
emerge
from
the
cliffs
and
reach
the
sea
it
is
blue
like
the
unclouded
sky
a
soft
dreamy
blue
and
our
path
turns
sharply
to
the
right
and
winds
along
overlooking
a
broad
beach
of
sand
and
the
sea
wind
blows
deliciously
with
a
sweet
saline
scent
urging
the
lungs
to
fill
themselves
to
the
very
utmost
and
far
away
before
me
i
perceive
a
beautiful
high
green
mass
an
island
rising
out
of
the
water
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
mainland
enoshima
the
holy
island
sacred
to
the
goddess
of
the
sea
the
goddess
of
beauty
i
can
already
distinguish
a
tiny
town
its
steep
slope
evidently
it
can
be
reached
on
foot
for
the
tide
is
out
and
has
left
bare
a
long
broad
reach
of
sand
extending
to
it
from
the
opposite
village
which
we
are
approaching
like
a
causeway
at
katase
the
little
settlement
facing
the
island
we
must
leave
our
jinricksha
and
walk
the
dunes
between
the
village
and
the
beach
are
too
deep
to
pull
the
vehicle
over
scores
of
other
jinricksha
are
waiting
here
in
the
little
narrow
street
for
pilgrims
who
have
preceded
me
but
i
am
told
i
am
the
only
european
who
visits
the
shrine
of
benten
our
two
men
lead
the
way
over
the
dunes
and
we
soon
descend
upon
damp
firm
sand
as
we
near
the
island
the
architectural
details
of
the
little
town
define
delightfully
through
the
faint
curved
bluish
sweeps
of
fantastic
roofs
angles
of
airy
balconies
curious
gables
all
above
a
fluttering
of
queerly
shaped
banners
covered
with
mysterious
lettering
we
pass
the
and
the
portal
of
the
the
city
of
the
is
before
us
a
beautiful
torii
all
of
bronze
it
is
with
shimenawa
of
bronze
above
it
and
a
brazen
tablet
inscribed
with
characters
declaring
is
the
palace
of
the
goddess
of
enoshima
about
the
bases
of
the
ponderous
pillars
are
strange
designs
in
relievo
eddyings
of
waves
with
tortoises
struggling
in
the
flow
this
is
really
the
gate
of
the
city
facing
the
shrine
of
benten
by
the
land
approach
but
it
is
only
the
third
torii
of
the
imposing
series
through
katase
we
did
not
see
the
others
having
come
by
way
of
the
coast
and
lo
we
are
in
enoshima
high
before
us
slopes
the
single
street
a
street
of
broad
steps
a
street
shadowy
full
of
flags
and
dank
blue
drapery
dashed
with
white
fantasticalities
which
are
words
fluttered
by
the
sea
wind
it
is
lined
with
taverns
and
miniature
shops
at
every
one
i
must
pause
to
look
and
to
dare
to
look
at
anything
in
japan
is
to
want
to
buy
it
so
i
buy
and
buy
and
buy
for
verily
is
the
city
of
this
enoshima
in
every
shop
behind
the
lettered
draperies
there
are
miracles
of
for
sale
at
absurdly
small
prices
the
glazed
cases
laid
flat
upon
the
matted
platforms
the
shelved
cabinets
set
against
the
walls
are
all
opalescent
with
nacreous
things
extraordinary
surprises
incredible
ingenuities
strings
of
fish
strings
of
birds
all
shimmering
with
rainbow
colours
there
are
little
kittens
of
and
little
foxes
of
and
little
puppies
of
and
girls
and
and
pipes
too
beautiful
to
use
there
are
little
tortoises
not
larger
than
a
shilling
made
of
shells
that
when
you
touch
them
however
lightly
begin
to
move
head
legs
and
tail
all
at
the
same
time
alternately
withdrawing
or
protruding
their
limbs
so
much
like
real
tortoises
as
to
give
one
a
shock
of
surprise
there
are
storks
and
birds
and
beetles
and
butterflies
and
crabs
and
lobsters
made
so
cunningly
of
shells
that
only
touch
convinces
you
they
are
not
alive
there
are
bees
of
shell
poised
on
flowers
of
the
same
material
poised
on
wire
in
such
a
way
that
they
seem
to
buzz
if
moved
only
with
the
tip
of
a
feather
there
is
jewellery
indescribable
things
that
japanese
girls
love
enchantments
in
carven
in
a
hundred
forms
brooches
necklaces
and
there
are
photographs
of
enoshima
sec
this
curious
street
ends
at
another
torii
a
wooden
torii
with
a
steeper
flight
of
stone
steps
ascending
to
it
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
are
votive
stone
lamps
and
a
little
well
and
a
stone
tank
at
which
all
pilgrims
wash
their
hands
and
rinse
their
mouths
before
approaching
the
temples
of
the
gods
and
hanging
beside
the
tank
are
bright
blue
towels
with
large
white
chinese
characters
upon
them
i
ask
akira
what
these
characters
signify
is
the
sound
of
the
characters
in
the
chinese
but
in
japanese
the
same
characters
are
pronounced
kenjitatetmatsuru
and
signify
that
those
towels
are
mostly
humbly
offered
to
benten
they
are
what
you
call
votive
offerings
and
there
are
many
kinds
of
votive
offerings
made
to
famous
shrines
some
people
give
towels
some
give
pictures
some
give
vases
some
offer
lanterns
of
paper
or
bronze
or
stone
it
is
common
to
promise
such
offerings
when
making
petitions
to
the
gods
and
it
is
usual
to
promise
a
torii
the
torii
may
be
small
or
great
according
to
the
wealth
of
him
who
gives
it
the
very
rich
pilgrim
may
offer
to
the
gods
a
torii
of
metal
such
as
that
below
which
is
the
gate
of
enoshima
do
the
japanese
always
keep
their
vows
to
the
gods
akira
smiles
a
sweet
smile
and
answers
was
a
man
who
promised
to
build
a
torii
of
good
metal
if
his
prayers
were
granted
and
he
obtained
all
that
he
desired
and
then
he
built
a
torii
with
three
exceedingly
small
needles
sec
ascending
the
steps
we
reach
a
terrace
overlooking
all
the
city
roofs
there
are
buddhist
lions
of
stone
and
stone
lanterns
mossed
and
chipped
on
either
side
the
torii
and
the
background
of
the
terrace
is
the
sacred
hill
covered
with
foliage
to
the
left
is
a
balustrade
of
stone
old
and
green
surrounding
a
shallow
pool
covered
with
scum
of
and
on
the
farther
bank
above
it
out
of
the
bushes
protrudes
a
strangely
shaped
stone
slab
poised
on
edge
and
covered
with
chinese
characters
it
is
a
sacred
stone
and
is
believed
to
have
the
form
of
a
great
frog
gama
wherefore
it
is
called
the
here
and
there
along
the
edge
of
the
terrace
are
other
graven
monuments
one
of
which
is
the
offering
of
certain
pilgrims
who
visited
the
shrine
of
the
one
hundred
times
on
the
right
other
flights
of
steps
lead
to
loftier
terraces
and
an
old
man
who
sits
at
the
foot
of
them
making
of
bamboo
offers
himself
as
guide
we
follow
him
to
the
next
terrace
where
there
is
a
school
for
the
children
of
enoshima
and
another
sacred
stone
huge
and
shapeless
the
stone
of
good
fortune
in
old
times
pilgrims
who
rubbed
their
hands
upon
it
believed
they
would
thereby
gain
riches
and
the
stone
is
polished
and
worn
by
the
touch
of
innumerable
palms

and
more
lions
and
lanterns
and
another
terrace
with
a
little
temple
in
its
midst
the
first
shrine
of
benten
before
it
a
few
stunted
are
growing
there
is
nothing
in
the
shrine
of
interest
only
shinto
emblems
but
there
is
another
well
beside
it
with
other
votive
towels
and
there
is
another
mysterious
monument
a
stone
shrine
brought
from
china
six
hundred
years
ago
perhaps
it
contained
some
statue
before
this
place
of
pilgrimage
was
given
over
to
the
priests
of
shinto
there
is
nothing
in
it
now
the
monolith
slab
forming
the
back
of
it
has
been
fractured
by
the
falling
of
rocks
from
the
cliff
above
and
the
inscription
cut
therein
has
been
almost
effaced
by
some
kind
of
scum
akira
reads
the
rest
is
undecipherable
he
says
there
is
a
statue
in
the
neighbouring
temple
but
it
is
exhibited
only
once
a
year
on
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
seventh
month
leaving
the
court
by
a
rising
path
to
the
left
we
proceed
along
the
verge
of
a
cliff
overlooking
the
sea
perched
upon
this
verge
are
pretty
all
widely
open
to
the
sea
wind
so
that
looking
through
them
over
their
matted
floors
and
lacquered
balconies
one
sees
the
ocean
as
in
a
and
the
pale
clear
horizon
specked
with
snowy
sails
and
a
faint
shape
also
like
a
phantom
island
the
far
vapoury
silhouette
of
oshima
then
we
find
another
torii
and
other
steps
leading
to
a
terrace
almost
black
with
shade
of
enormous
evergreen
trees
and
surrounded
on
the
sea
side
by
another
stone
balustrade
velveted
with
moss
on
the
right
more
steps
another
torii
another
terrace
and
more
mossed
green
lions
and
stone
lamps
and
a
monument
inscribed
with
the
record
of
the
change
whereby
enoshima
passed
away
from
buddhism
to
become
shino
beyond
in
the
centre
of
another
plateau
the
second
shrine
of
benten
but
there
is
no
benten
benten
has
been
hidden
away
by
shinto
hands
the
second
shrine
is
void
as
the
first
nevertheless
in
a
building
to
the
left
of
the
temple
strange
relics
are
exhibited
feudal
armour
suits
of
plate
and
helmets
with
visors
which
are
demoniac
masks
of
iron
helmets
crested
with
dragons
of
gold
swords
worthy
of
giants
and
enormous
arrows
more
than
five
feet
long
with
shafts
nearly
an
inch
in
diameter
one
has
a
crescent
head
about
nine
inches
from
horn
to
horn
the
interior
edge
of
the
crescent
being
sharp
as
a
knife
such
a
missile
would
take
off
a
man
head
and
i
can
scarcely
believe
akira
assurance
that
such
ponderous
arrows
were
shot
from
a
bow
by
hand
only
there
is
a
specimen
of
the
writing
of
nichiren
the
great
buddhist
priest
gold
characters
on
a
blue
ground
and
there
is
in
a
lacquered
shrine
a
gilded
dragon
said
to
have
been
made
by
that
still
greater
priest
and
writer
and
kobodaishi
a
path
shaded
by
overarching
trees
leads
from
this
plateau
to
the
third
shrine
we
pass
a
torii
and
beyond
it
come
to
a
stone
monument
covered
with
figures
of
monkeys
chiselled
in
relief
what
the
signification
of
this
monument
is
even
our
guide
can
not
explain
then
another
torii
it
is
of
wood
but
i
am
told
it
replaces
one
of
metal
stolen
in
the
night
by
thieves
wonderful
thieves
that
torii
must
have
weighed
at
least
a
ton
more
stone
lanterns
then
an
immense
count
on
the
very
summit
of
the
mountain
and
there
in
its
midst
the
third
and
chief
temple
of
benten
and
before
the
temple
is
a
large
vacant
space
surrounded
by
a
fence
in
such
manner
as
to
render
the
shrine
totally
inaccessible
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
there
is
however
a
little
haiden
or
place
of
prayer
with
nothing
in
it
but
a
and
a
bell
before
the
fence
and
facing
the
temple
steps
here
the
pilgrims
make
their
offerings
and
pray
only
a
small
raised
platform
covered
with
a
chinese
roof
supported
upon
four
plain
posts
the
back
of
the
structure
being
closed
by
a
lattice
about
breast
high
from
this
we
can
look
into
the
temple
of
benten
and
see
that
benten
is
not
there
but
i
perceive
that
the
ceiling
is
arranged
in
caissons
and
in
a
central
caisson
i
discover
a
very
curious
painting
a
foreshortened
tortoise
gazing
down
at
me
and
while
i
am
looking
at
it
i
hear
akira
and
the
guide
laughing
and
the
latter
exclaims
a
beautiful
little
damask
snake
is
undulating
up
the
poking
its
head
through
betimes
to
look
at
us
it
does
not
seem
in
the
least
afraid
nor
has
it
much
reason
to
be
seeing
that
its
kind
are
deemed
the
servants
and
confidants
of
benten
sometimes
the
great
goddess
herself
assumes
the
serpent
form
perhaps
she
has
come
to
see
us
near
by
is
a
singular
stone
set
on
a
pedestal
in
the
court
it
has
the
form
of
the
body
of
a
tortoise
and
markings
like
those
of
the
creature
shell
and
it
is
held
a
sacred
thing
and
is
called
the
but
i
fear
exceedingly
that
in
all
this
place
we
shall
find
nothing
save
stones
and
serpents
sec
now
we
are
going
to
visit
the
dragon
cavern
not
so
called
akira
says
because
the
dragon
of
benten
ever
dwelt
therein
but
because
the
shape
of
the
cavern
is
the
shape
of
a
dragon
the
path
descends
toward
the
opposite
side
of
the
island
and
suddenly
breaks
into
a
flight
of
steps
cut
out
of
the
pale
hard
rock
exceedingly
steep
and
worn
and
slippery
and
perilous
overlooking
the
sea
a
vision
of
low
pale
rocks
and
surf
bursting
among
them
and
a
toro
or
votive
stone
lamp
in
the
centre
of
them
all
seen
as
in
a
view
over
the
verge
of
an
awful
precipice
i
see
also
deep
round
holes
in
one
of
the
rocks
there
used
to
be
a
below
and
the
wooden
pillars
supporting
it
were
fitted
into
those
holes
i
descend
with
caution
the
japanese
seldom
slip
in
their
straw
sandals
but
i
can
only
proceed
with
the
aid
of
the
guide
at
almost
every
step
i
slip
surely
these
steps
could
never
have
been
thus
worn
away
by
the
straw
sandals
of
pilgrims
who
came
to
see
only
stones
and
serpents
at
last
we
reach
a
plank
gallery
carried
along
the
face
of
the
cliff
above
the
rocks
and
pools
and
following
it
round
a
projection
of
the
cliff
enter
the
sacred
cave
the
light
dims
as
we
advance
and
the
running
after
us
into
the
gloom
make
a
stupefying
roar
multiplied
by
the
extraordinary
echo
looking
back
i
see
the
mouth
of
the
cavern
like
a
prodigious
sharply
angled
rent
in
blackness
showing
a
fragment
of
azure
sky
we
reach
a
shrine
with
no
deity
in
it
pay
a
fee
and
lamps
being
lighted
and
given
to
each
of
us
we
proceed
to
explore
a
series
of
underground
passages
so
black
they
are
that
even
with
the
light
of
three
lamps
i
can
at
first
see
nothing
in
a
while
however
i
can
distinguish
stone
figures
in
relief
chiselled
on
slabs
like
those
i
saw
in
the
buddhist
graveyard
these
are
placed
at
regular
intervals
along
the
rock
walls
the
guide
approaches
his
light
to
the
face
of
each
one
and
utters
a
name
sometimes
in
lieu
of
a
statue
there
is
an
empty
shrine
only
with
a
before
it
and
these
void
shrines
have
names
of
shinto
gods
all
the
statues
are
black
or
seem
black
in
the
yellow
lamplight
and
sparkle
as
if
frosted
i
feel
as
if
i
were
in
some
mortuary
pit
some
subterranean
of
dead
gods
interminable
the
corridor
appears
yet
there
is
at
last
an
end
an
end
with
a
shrine
in
it
where
the
rocky
ceiling
descends
so
low
that
to
reach
the
shrine
one
must
go
down
on
hands
and
knees
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
shrine
this
is
the
tail
of
the
dragon
we
do
not
return
to
the
light
at
once
but
enter
into
other
lateral
black
corridors
the
wings
of
the
dragon
more
sable
effigies
of
dispossessed
gods
more
empty
shrines
more
stone
faces
covered
with
saltpetre
and
more
possible
only
to
reach
by
stooping
where
more
offerings
should
be
made
and
there
is
no
benten
either
of
wood
or
stone
i
am
glad
to
return
to
the
light
here
our
guide
strips
naked
and
suddenly
leaps
head
foremost
into
a
black
deep
swirling
current
between
rocks
five
minutes
later
he
reappears
and
clambering
out
lays
at
my
feet
a
living
squirming
and
an
enormous
shrimp
then
he
resumes
his
robe
and
we
the
mountain
sec
this
the
reader
may
say
is
all
that
you
went
forth
to
see
a
torii
some
shells
a
small
damask
snake
some
stones
it
is
true
and
nevertheless
i
know
that
i
am
bewitched
there
is
a
charm
indefinable
about
the
place
that
sort
of
charm
which
comes
with
a
little
ghostly
thrill
never
to
be
forgotten
not
of
strange
sights
alone
is
this
charm
made
but
of
numberless
subtle
sensations
and
ideas
interwoven
and
the
sweet
sharp
scents
of
grove
and
sea
the
vivifying
touch
of
the
free
wind
the
dumb
appeal
of
ancient
mystic
mossy
things
vague
reverence
evoked
by
knowledge
of
treading
soil
called
holy
for
a
thousand
years
and
a
sense
of
sympathy
as
a
human
duty
compelled
by
the
vision
of
steps
of
rock
worn
down
into
shapelessness
by
the
pilgrim
feet
of
vanished
generations
and
other
memories
ineffaceable
the
first
sight
of
the
city
of
pearl
through
a
fairy
veil
of
haze
the
windy
approach
to
the
lovely
island
over
the
velvety
soundless
brown
stretch
of
sand
the
weird
majesty
of
the
giant
gate
of
bronze
the
queer
fantastic
quaintly
gabled
street
flinging
down
sharp
shadows
of
aerial
balconies
the
flutter
of
coloured
draperies
in
the
sea
wind
and
of
flags
with
their
riddles
of
lettering
the
pearly
glimmering
of
the
astonishing
shops
and
impressions
of
the
enormous
day
the
day
of
the
land
of
the
gods
a
loftier
day
than
ever
our
summers
know
and
the
glory
of
the
view
from
those
green
sacred
silent
heights
between
sea
and
sun
and
the
remembrance
of
the
sky
a
sky
spiritual
as
holiness
a
sky
with
clouds
and
white
as
the
light
itself
seeming
indeed
not
clouds
but
dreams
or
souls
of
bodhisattvas
about
to
melt
for
ever
into
some
blue
nirvana
and
the
romance
of
benten
too
the
deity
of
beauty
the
divinity
of
love
the
goddess
of
eloquence
rightly
is
she
likewise
named
goddess
of
the
sea
for
is
not
the
sea
most
ancient
and
most
excellent
of
speakers
the
eternal
poet
chanter
of
that
mystic
hymn
whose
rhythm
shakes
the
world
whose
mighty
syllables
no
man
may
learn
sec
we
return
by
another
route
for
a
while
the
way
winds
through
a
long
narrow
winding
valley
between
wooded
hills
the
whole
extent
of
is
occupied
by
the
air
has
a
humid
coolness
and
one
hears
only
the
chanting
of
frogs
like
a
clattering
of
countless
castanets
as
the
jinricksha
jolts
over
the
rugged
elevated
paths
separating
the
flooded
as
we
skirt
the
foot
of
a
wooded
hill
upon
the
right
my
japanese
comrade
signals
to
our
runners
to
halt
and
himself
dismounting
points
to
the
blue
peaked
roof
of
a
little
temple
on
the
green
slope
it
really
worth
while
to
climb
up
there
in
the
sun
i
ask
yes
he
answers
is
the
temple
of
kishibojin
kishibojin
the
mother
of
demons
we
ascend
a
flight
of
broad
stone
steps
meet
the
buddhist
guardian
lions
at
the
summit
and
enter
the
little
court
in
which
the
temple
stands
an
elderly
woman
with
a
child
clinging
to
her
robe
comes
from
the
adjoining
building
to
open
the
screens
for
us
and
taking
off
our
footgear
we
enter
the
temple
without
the
edifice
looked
old
and
dingy
but
within
all
is
neat
and
pretty
the
june
sun
pouring
through
the
open
shoji
illuminates
an
artistic
confusion
of
brasses
gracefully
shaped
and
things
images
lanterns
paintings
gilded
inscriptions
pendent
scrolls
there
are
three
altars
above
the
central
altar
amida
buddha
sits
enthroned
on
his
mystic
golden
lotus
in
the
attitude
of
the
teacher
on
the
altar
to
the
right
gleams
a
shrine
of
five
miniature
golden
steps
where
little
images
stand
in
rows
tier
above
tier
some
seated
some
erect
male
and
female
attired
like
goddesses
or
like
daimyo
the
sanjiubanjin
or
thirty
guardians
below
on
the
façade
of
the
altar
is
the
figure
of
a
hero
slaying
a
monster
on
the
altar
to
the
left
is
the
shrine
of
the
her
story
is
a
legend
of
horror
for
some
sin
committed
in
a
previous
birth
she
was
born
a
demon
devouring
her
own
children
but
being
saved
by
the
teaching
of
buddha
she
became
a
divine
being
especially
loving
and
protecting
infants
and
japanese
mothers
pray
to
her
for
their
little
ones
and
wives
pray
to
her
for
beautiful
boys
the
face
of
kishibojin
is
the
face
of
a
comely
woman
but
her
eyes
are
weird
in
her
right
hand
she
bears
a
with
her
left
she
supports
in
a
fold
of
her
robe
against
her
breast
a
naked
baby
at
the
foot
of
her
shrine
stands
leaning
upon
his
shakujo
but
the
altar
and
its
images
do
not
form
the
startling
feature
of
the
what
impresses
the
visitor
in
a
totally
novel
way
are
the
votive
offerings
high
before
the
shrine
suspended
from
strings
stretched
taut
between
tall
poles
of
bamboo
are
scores
no
hundreds
of
pretty
tiny
dresses
japanese
of
many
colours
most
are
made
of
poor
material
for
these
are
the
of
very
poor
simple
women
poor
country
mothers
whose
prayers
to
kishibojin
for
the
blessing
of
children
have
been
heard
and
the
sight
of
all
those
little
dresses
each
telling
so
naively
its
story
of
joy
and
pain
those
tiny
kimono
shaped
and
sewn
by
docile
patient
fingers
of
humble
mothers
touches
irresistibly
like
some
unexpected
revelation
of
the
universal
and
the
tenderness
of
all
the
simple
hearts
that
have
testified
thus
to
faith
and
thankfulness
seems
to
thrill
all
about
me
softly
like
a
caress
of
summer
wind
outside
the
world
appears
to
have
suddenly
grown
beautiful
the
light
is
sweeter
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
new
charm
even
in
the
azure
of
the
eternal
day
sec
then
having
traversed
the
valley
we
reach
a
main
road
so
level
and
so
magnificently
shaded
by
huge
old
trees
that
i
could
believe
myself
in
an
english
lane
a
lane
in
kent
or
surrey
perhaps
but
for
some
exotic
detail
breaking
the
illusion
at
intervals
a
torii
towering
before
descending
to
the
highway
or
a
signboard
lettered
with
chinese
characters
or
the
wayside
shrine
of
some
unknown
god
all
at
once
i
observe
by
the
roadside
some
unfamiliar
sculptures
in
relief
a
row
of
chiselled
slabs
protected
by
a
little
bamboo
shed
and
i
dismount
to
look
at
them
supposing
them
to
be
funereal
monuments
they
are
so
old
that
the
lines
of
their
sculpturing
are
half
obliterated
their
feet
are
covered
with
moss
and
their
visages
are
half
effaced
but
i
can
discern
that
these
are
not
haka
but
six
images
of
one
divinity
and
my
guide
knows
him
koshin
the
god
of
roads
so
chipped
and
covered
with
scurf
he
is
that
the
upper
portion
of
his
form
has
become
indefinably
vague
his
attributes
have
been
worn
away
but
below
his
feet
on
several
slabs
chiselled
cunningly
i
can
still
distinguish
the
figures
of
the
three
apes
his
messengers
and
some
pious
soul
has
left
before
one
image
a
humble
votive
offering
the
picture
of
a
black
cock
and
a
white
hen
painted
upon
a
wooden
shingle
it
must
have
been
left
here
very
long
ago
the
wood
has
become
almost
black
and
the
painting
has
been
damaged
by
weather
and
by
the
droppings
of
birds
there
are
no
stones
piled
at
the
feet
of
these
images
as
before
the
images
of
jizo
they
seem
like
things
forgotten
crusted
over
by
the
neglect
of
generations
archaic
gods
who
have
lost
their
worshippers
but
my
guide
tells
me
temple
of
koshin
is
near
in
the
village
of
fujisawa
assuredly
i
must
visit
it
sec
the
temple
of
koshin
is
situated
in
the
middle
of
the
village
in
a
court
opening
upon
the
main
street
a
very
old
wooden
temple
it
is
unpainted
dilapidated
grey
with
the
greyness
of
all
forgotten
and
things
it
is
some
time
before
the
guardian
of
the
temple
can
be
found
to
open
the
doors
for
this
temple
has
doors
in
lieu
of
shoji
old
doors
that
moan
sleepily
at
being
turned
upon
their
hinges
and
it
is
not
necessary
to
remove
one
shoes
the
floor
is
matless
covered
with
dust
and
squeaks
under
the
unaccustomed
weight
of
entering
feet
all
within
is
crumbling
mouldering
worn
the
shrine
has
no
image
only
shinto
emblems
some
poor
paper
lanterns
whose
once
bright
colours
have
vanished
under
a
coating
of
dust
some
vague
inscriptions
i
see
the
circular
frame
of
a
metal
mirror
but
the
mirror
itself
is
gone
whither
the
guardian
says
priest
lives
now
in
this
temple
and
thieves
might
come
in
the
night
to
steal
the
mirror
so
we
have
hidden
it
away
i
ask
about
the
image
of
koshin
he
answers
it
is
exposed
but
once
in
every
years
so
i
can
not
see
it
but
there
are
other
statues
of
the
god
in
the
temple
court
i
go
to
look
at
them
a
row
of
images
much
like
those
upon
the
public
highway
but
better
preserved
one
figure
of
koshin
however
is
different
from
the
others
i
have
seen
apparently
made
after
some
hindoo
model
judging
by
the
indian
coiffure
and
lofty
the
god
has
three
eyes
one
in
the
centre
of
his
forehead
opening
perpendicularly
instead
of
horizontally
he
has
six
arms
with
one
hand
he
supports
a
monkey
with
another
he
grasps
a
serpent
and
the
other
hands
hold
out
symbolic
things
a
wheel
a
sword
a
rosary
a
sceptre
and
serpents
are
coiled
about
his
wrists
and
about
his
ankles
and
under
his
feet
is
a
monstrous
head
the
head
of
a
demon
amanjako
sometimes
called
utatesa
upon
the
pedestal
below
the
three
apes
are
carven
and
the
face
of
an
ape
appears
also
upon
the
front
of
the
tiara
i
see
also
tablets
of
stone
graven
only
with
the
god
name
votive
offerings
and
near
by
in
a
tiny
wooden
shrine
is
the
figure
of
the
grey
primeval
vaguely
wrought
holding
in
one
hand
a
spear
in
the
other
a
vessel
containing
something
indistinguishable
sec
perhaps
to
uninitiated
eyes
these
gods
at
first
may
seem
as
they
seem
always
in
the
sight
of
christian
bigotry
only
monstrous
but
when
the
knowledge
of
their
meaning
comes
to
one
who
feels
the
divine
in
all
religions
then
they
will
be
found
to
make
appeal
to
the
higher
aestheticism
to
the
sense
of
moral
beauty
with
a
force
never
to
be
divined
by
minds
knowing
nothing
of
the
orient
and
its
thought
to
me
the
image
of
kwannon
of
the
thousand
hands
is
not
less
admirable
than
any
other
representation
of
human
loveliness
idealised
bearing
her
name
the
peerless
the
majestic
the
or
even
white
who
sails
the
moonlit
waters
in
her
rosy
boat
made
of
a
single
and
in
the
shaka
i
discern
and
revere
the
mighty
power
of
that
truth
whereby
as
by
a
conjunction
of
suns
the
three
worlds
have
been
illuminated
but
vain
to
seek
to
memorise
the
names
and
attributes
of
all
the
gods
they
seem
to
mock
the
seeker
kwannon
the
merciful
is
revealed
as
the
hundred
kwannon
the
six
jizo
become
the
thousand
and
as
they
multiply
before
research
they
vary
and
change
less
multiform
less
complex
less
elusive
the
moving
of
waters
than
the
visions
of
this
oriental
faith
into
it
as
into
a
fathomless
sea
mythology
after
mythology
from
india
and
china
and
the
farther
east
has
sunk
and
been
absorbed
and
the
stranger
peering
into
its
deeps
finds
himself
as
in
the
tale
of
undine
contemplating
a
flood
in
whose
every
surge
rises
and
vanishes
a
face
weird
or
beautiful
or
terrible
a
most
ancient
shoreless
sea
of
forms
incomprehensibly
interchanging
and
intermingling
but
symbolising
the
protean
magic
of
that
infinite
unknown
that
shapes
and
for
ever
all
cosmic
being
sec
i
wonder
if
i
can
buy
a
picture
of
koshin
in
most
japanese
temples
little
pictures
of
the
tutelar
deity
are
sold
to
pilgrims
cheap
prints
on
thin
paper
but
the
temple
guardian
here
tells
me
with
a
gesture
of
despair
that
there
are
no
pictures
of
koshin
for
sale
there
is
only
an
old
kakemono
on
which
the
god
is
represented
if
i
would
like
to
see
it
he
will
go
home
and
get
it
for
me
i
beg
him
to
do
me
the
favour
and
he
hurries
into
the
street
while
awaiting
his
return
i
continue
to
examine
the
queer
old
statues
with
a
feeling
of
mingled
melancholy
and
pleasure
to
have
studied
and
loved
an
ancient
faith
only
through
the
labours
of
palaeographers
and
archaeologists
and
as
a
something
astronomically
remote
from
one
own
existence
and
then
suddenly
in
after
years
to
find
the
same
faith
a
part
of
one
human
environment
to
feel
that
its
mythology
though
senescent
is
alive
all
around
you
is
almost
to
realise
the
dream
of
the
romantics
to
have
the
sensation
of
returning
through
twenty
centuries
into
the
life
of
a
happier
world
for
these
quaint
gods
of
roads
and
gods
of
earth
are
really
living
still
though
so
worn
and
mossed
and
feebly
worshipped
in
this
brief
moment
at
least
i
am
really
in
the
elder
world
perhaps
just
at
that
epoch
of
it
when
the
primal
faith
is
growing
a
little
crumbling
slowly
before
the
corrosive
influence
of
a
new
philosophy
and
i
know
myself
a
pagan
still
loving
these
simple
old
gods
these
gods
of
a
people
childhood
and
they
need
some
human
love
these
naive
innocent
ugly
gods
the
beautiful
divinities
will
live
for
ever
by
that
sweetness
of
womanhood
idealised
in
the
buddhist
art
of
them
eternal
are
kwannon
and
benten
they
need
no
help
of
man
they
will
compel
reverence
when
the
great
temples
shall
all
have
become
voiceless
and
priestless
as
this
shrine
of
koshin
is
but
these
kind
queer
artless
mouldering
gods
who
have
given
ease
to
so
many
troubled
minds
who
have
gladdened
so
many
simple
hearts
who
have
heard
so
many
innocent
prayers
how
gladly
would
i
prolong
their
beneficent
lives
in
spite
of
the
of
progress
and
the
irrefutable
philosophy
of
evolution
the
guardian
returns
bringing
with
him
a
kakemono
very
small
very
dusty
and
so
by
time
that
it
might
be
a
thousand
years
old
but
i
am
disappointed
as
i
unroll
it
there
is
only
a
very
common
print
of
the
god
within
all
outline
and
while
i
am
looking
at
it
i
become
for
the
first
time
conscious
that
a
crowd
has
gathered
about
me
tanned
labourers
from
the
fields
and
mothers
with
their
babies
on
their
backs
and
school
children
and
jinricksha
men
all
wondering
that
a
stranger
should
be
thus
interested
in
their
gods
and
although
the
pressure
about
me
is
very
very
gentle
like
a
pressure
of
tepid
water
for
gentleness
i
feel
a
little
embarrassed
i
give
back
the
old
kakemono
to
the
guardian
make
my
offering
to
the
god
and
take
my
leave
of
koshin
and
his
good
servant
all
the
kind
oblique
eyes
follow
me
as
i
go
and
something
like
a
feeling
of
remorse
seizes
me
at
thus
abruptly
abandoning
the
void
dusty
crumbling
temple
with
its
mirrorless
altar
and
its
colourless
lanterns
and
the
decaying
sculptures
of
its
neglected
court
and
its
kindly
guardian
whom
i
see
still
watching
my
retreating
steps
with
the
yellow
kakemono
in
his
hand
the
whistle
of
a
locomotive
warns
me
that
i
shall
just
have
time
to
catch
the
train
for
western
civilisation
has
invaded
all
this
primitive
peace
with
its
webs
of
steel
with
its
ways
of
iron
this
is
not
of
thy
roads
o
koshin
the
old
gods
are
dying
along
its
verge
chapter
five
at
the
market
of
the
dead
sec
it
is
just
past
five
in
the
afternoon
through
the
open
door
of
my
little
study
the
rising
breeze
of
evening
is
beginning
to
disturb
the
papers
on
my
desk
and
the
white
fire
of
the
japanese
sun
is
taking
that
pale
amber
tone
which
tells
that
the
heat
of
the
day
is
over
there
is
not
a
cloud
in
the
blue
not
even
one
of
those
beautiful
white
filamentary
things
like
ghosts
of
silken
floss

usually
swim
in

most
ethereal
of

a
market
at
which
will
be
sold
all
things
required
for
the
festival

and
the
festival
of
the
dead
will
begin
when
all
the
altars
of
the
temples
and
all
the
shrines
in
the
homes
of
good
buddhists
will
be
made
beautiful
i
want
to
see
the
akira
and
i
should
also
like
to
see
a
buddhist
shrine
a

shrine
will
you
come
to
my
room
asks
akira
is
not
far
in
the
street
of
the
aged
men
beyond
the
street
of
the
stony
river
and
near
to
the
street
everlasting
there
is
a
butsuma
there
a
household
shrine
and
on
the
way
i
will
tell
you
about
the
bonku
so
for
the
first
time
i
learn
those
things
which
i
am
now
about
to
write
sec
from
the
to
the
day
of
july
is
held
the
festival
of
the
dead
the
bommatsuri
or
bonku
by
some
europeans
called
the
feast
of
lanterns
but
in
many
places
there
are
two
such
festivals
annually
for
those
who
still
follow
the
ancient
reckoning
of
time
by
moons
hold
that
the
bommatsuri
should
fall
on
the
and
days
of
the
seventh
month
of
the
antique
calendar
which
corresponds
to
a
later
period
of
the
year
early
on
the
morning
of
the
new
mats
of
purest
rice
straw
woven
expressly
for
the
festival
are
spread
upon
all
buddhist
altars
and
within
each
butsuma
or
butsudan
the
little
shrine
before
which
the
morning
and
evening
prayers
are
offered
up
in
every
believing
home
shrines
and
altars
are
likewise
decorated
with
beautiful
embellishments
of
coloured
paper
and
with
flowers
and
sprigs
of
certain
hallowed
plants
always
real
when
obtainable
otherwise
of
paper
and
fresh
branches
of
shikimi
anise
and
of
misohagi
lespedeza
then
a
tiny
lacquered
table
a
as
japanese
meals
are
usually
served
upon
is
placed
upon
the
altar
and
the
food
offerings
are
laid
on
it
but
in
the
smaller
shrines
of
japanese
homes
the
offerings
are
more
often
simply
laid
upon
the
rice
matting
wrapped
in
fresh
these
offerings
consist
of
the
foods
called
somen
resembling
our
vermicelli
gozen
which
is
boiled

dango
a
sort
of
tiny
dumpling
eggplant

frequently
uri
and
saikwa
slices
of
melon
and
watermelon
and
plums
and
peaches
often
sweet
cakes
and
dainties
are
added
sometimes
the
offering
is
only
honourable
uncooked
food
more
usually
it
is
honourable
boiled
food
but
it
never
includes
of
course
fish
meats
or
wine
clear
water
is
given
to
the
shadowy
guest
and
is
sprinkled
from
time
to

upon
the
altar
or
within
the
shrine
with
a
branch
of
misohagi
tea
is
poured
out
every
hour
for
the
viewless
visitors
and
everything
is
daintily
served
up
in
little
plates
and
cups
and
bowls
as
for

guests
with

laid
beside

by
which
the

is
situated
neither
more
nor
less
than
one
hundred
and
eight
fires
this
number
having
some
mystic
signification
in
the
philosophy
of
buddhism
and
charming
lanterns
are
suspended
each
night
at
the
entrances
of
homes
the
lanterns
of
the
festival
of
the
dead
lanterns
of
special
forms
and
colours
beautifully
painted
with
suggestions
of
landscape
and
shapes
of
flowers
and
always
decorated
with
a
peculiar
fringe
of
paper
streamers
also
on
the
same
night
those
who
have
dead
friends
go
to
the
cemeteries
and
make
offerings
there
and
pray
and
burn
incense
and
pour
out
water
for
the
ghosts
flowers
are
placed
there
in
the
bamboo
vases
set
beside
each
haka
and
lanterns
are
lighted
and
hung
up
before
the
tombs
but
these
lanterns
have
no
designs
upon
them
at
sunset
on
the
evening
of
the
only
the
offerings
called
segaki
are
made
in
the
temples
then
are
fed
the
ghosts
of
the
circle
of
penance
called
gakido
the
place
of
hungry
spirits
and
then
also
are
fed
by
the
priests
those
ghosts
having
no
other
friends
among
the
living
to
care
for
them
very
very
small
these
offerings
are
like
the
offerings
to
the
gods
sec
now
this
akira
tells
me
is
the
origin
of
the
segaki
as
the
same
is
related
in
the
holy
book
the
great
disciple
of
buddha
obtained
by
merit
the
six
supernatural
powers
and
by
virtue
of
them
it
was
given
him
to
see
the
soul
of
his
mother
in
the
gakido
the
world
of
spirits
doomed
to
suffer
hunger
in
expiation
of
faults
committed
in
a
previous
life
mokenren
saw
that
his
mother
suffered
much
he
grieved
exceedingly
because
of
her
pain
and
he
filled
a
bowl
with
choicest
food
and
sent
it
to
her
he
saw
her
try
to
eat
but
each
time
that
she
tried
to
lift
the
food
to
her
lips
it
would
change
into
fire
and
burning
embers
so
that
she
could
not
eat
then
mokenren
asked
the
teacher
what
he
could
do
to
relieve
his
mother
from
pain
and
the
teacher
made
answer
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
seventh
month
feed
the
ghosts
of
the
great
priests
of
all
countries
and
mokenren
having
done
so
saw
that
his
mother
was
freed
from
the
state
of
gaki
and
that
she
was
dancing
for
joy
this
is
the
origin
also
of
the
dances
called
which
are
danced
on
the
third
night
of
the
festival
of
the
dead
throughout
japan
upon
the
third
and
last
night
there
is
a
weirdly
beautiful
ceremony
more
touching
than
that
of
the
segaki
stranger
than
the
the
ceremony
of
farewell
all
that
the
living
may
do
to
please
the
dead
has
been
done
the
time
allotted
by
the
powers
of
the
unseen
worlds
unto
the
ghostly
visitants
is
well
nigh
past
and
their
friends
must
send
them
all
back
again
everything
has
been
prepared
for
them
in
each
home
small
boats
made
of
barley
straw
closely
woven
have
been
freighted
with
supplies
of
choice
food
with
tiny
lanterns
and
written
messages
of
faith
and
love
seldom
more
than
two
feet
in
length
are
these
boats
but
the
dead
require
little
room
and
the
frail
craft
are
launched
on
canal
lake
sea
or
river
each
with
a
miniature
lantern
glowing
at
the
prow
and
incense
burning
at
the
stern
and
if
the
night
be
fair
they
voyage
long
down
all
the
creeks
and
rivers
and
canals
the
phantom
fleets
go
glimmering
to
the
sea
and
all
the
sea
sparkles
to
the
horizon
with
the
lights
of
the
dead
and
the
sea
wind
is
fragrant
with
incense
but
alas
it
is
now
forbidden
in
the
great
seaports
to
launch
the
shoryobune
boats
of
the
blessed
ghosts
sec
it
is
so
narrow
the
street
of
the
aged
men
that
by
stretching
out
one
arms
one
can
touch
the
figured
before
its
tiny
shops
on
both
sides
at
once
and
these
little
houses
really
seem
that
in
which
akira
lives
is
even
smaller
than
the
rest
having
no
shop
in
it
and
no
miniature
second
story
it
is
all
closed
up
akira
slides
back
the
wooden
amado
which
forms
the
door
and
then
the
screens
behind
it
and
the
tiny
structure
thus
opened
with
its
light
unpainted
woodwork
and
painted
paper
partitions
looks
something
like
a
great
but
the
rush
matting
of
the
elevated
floor
is
fresh
spotless
and
as
we
take
off
our
footgear
to
mount
upon
it
i
see
that
all
within
is
neat
curious
and
pretty
woman
has
gone
out
says
akira
setting
the
hibachi
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
spreading
beside
it
a
little
mat
for
me
to
squat
upon
what
is
this
akira
i
ask
pointing
to
a
thin
board
suspended
by
a
ribbon
on
the
wall
a
board
so
cut
from
the
middle
of
a
branch
as
to
leave
the
bark
along
its
edges
there
are
two
columns
of
mysterious
signs
exquisitely
painted
upon
it
that
is
a
calendar
answers
akira
the
right
side
are
the
names
of
the
months
having
days
on
the
left
the
names
of
those
having
less
now
here
is
a
household
shrine
occupying
the
alcove
which
is
an
indispensable
part
of
the
structure
of
japanese
is
a
native
cabinet
painted
with
figures
of
flying
birds
and
on
this
cabinet
stands
the
butsuma
it
is
a
small
lacquered
and
gilded
shrine
with
little
doors
modelled
after
those
of
a
temple
gate
a
shrine
very
quaint
very
much
dilapidated
one
door
has
lost
its
hinges
but
still
a
dainty
thing
despite
its
crackled
lacquer
and
faded
gilding
akira
opens
it
with
a
sort
of
compassionate
smile
and
i
look
inside
for
the
image
there
is
none
only
a
wooden
tablet
with
a
band
of
white
paper
attached
to
it
bearing
japanese
characters
the
name
of
a
dead
baby
girl
and
a
vase
of
expiring
flowers
a
tiny
print
of
kwannon
the
goddess
of
mercy
and
a
cup
filled
with
ashes
of
incense
akira
says
will
decorate
this
and
make
the
offerings
of
food
to
the
little
one
hanging
from
the
ceiling
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
and
in
front
of
the
shrine
is
a
wonderful
charming
funny
mask
the
face
of
a
laughing
chubby
girl
with
two
mysterious
spots
upon
her
forehead
the
face
of
otafuku
it
twirls
round
and
round
in
the
soft
coming
through
the
open
shoji
and
every
time
those
funny
black
eyes
half
shut
with
laughter
look
at
me
i
can
not
help
smiling
and
hanging
still
higher
i
see
little
shinto
emblems
of
paper
gohei
a
miniature
cap
in
likeness
of
those
worn
in
the
sacred
dances
a
pasteboard
emblem
of
the
magic
gem
hojiu
which
the
gods
bear
in
their
hands
a
small
japanese
doll
and
a
little
which
will
spin
around
with
the
least
puff
of
air
and
other
indescribable
toys
mostly
symbolic
such
as
are
sold
on
festal
days
in
the
courts
of
the
temples
the
playthings
of
the
dead
child
exclaims
a
very
gentle
voice
behind
us
the
mother
is
standing
there
smiling
as
if
pleased
at
the
stranger
interest
in
her
butsuma
a
woman
of
the
poorest
class
not
comely
but
with
a
most
kindly
face
we
return
her
evening
greeting
and
while
i
sit
down
upon
the
little
mat
laid
before
the
hibachi
akira
whispers
something
to
her
with
the
result
that
a
small
kettle
is
at
once
set
to
boil
over
a
very
small
charcoal
furnace
we
are
probably
going
to
have
some
tea
as
akira
takes
his
seat
before
me
on
the
other
side
of
the
hibachi
i
ask
him
was
the
name
i
saw
on
the
tablet
name
which
you
saw
he
answers
not
the
real
name
the
real
name
is
written
upon
the
other
side
after
death
another
name
is
given
by
the
priest
a
dead
boy
is
called
ryochi
doji
a
dead
girl
mioyo
donyo
while
we
are
speaking
the
woman
approaches
the
little
shrine
opens
it
arranges
the
objects
in
it
lights
the
tiny
lamp
and
with
joined
hands
and
bowed
head
begins
to
pray
totally
unembarrassed
by
our
presence
and
our
chatter
she
seems
as
one
accustomed
to
do
what
is
right
and
beautiful
heedless
of
human
opinion
praying
with
that
brave
true
frankness
which
belongs
to
the
poor
only
of
this
world
those
simple
souls
who
never
have
any
secret
to
hide
either
from
each
other
or
from
heaven
and
of
whom
ruskin
nobly
said
are
our
holiest
i
do
not
know
what
words
her
heart
is
murmuring
i
hear
only
at
moments
that
soft
sibilant
sound
made
by
gently
drawing
the
breath
through
the
lips
which
among
this
kind
people
is
a
token
of
humblest
desire
to
please
as
i
watch
the
tender
little
rite
i
become
aware
of
something
dimly
astir
in
the
mystery
of
my
own
life
vaguely
indefinably
familiar
like
a
memory
ancestral
like
the
revival
of
a
sensation
forgotten
two
thousand
years
blended
in
some
strange
way
it
seems
to
be
with
my
faint
knowledge
of
an
elder
world
whose
household
gods
were
also
the
beloved
dead
and
there
is
a
weird
sweetness
in
this
place
like
a
shadowing
of
lares
then
her
brief
prayer
over
she
turns
to
her
miniature
furnace
again
she
talks
and
laughs
with
akira
she
prepares
the
tea
pours
it
out
in
tiny
cups
and
serves
it
to
us
kneeling
in
that
graceful
attitude
picturesque
traditional
which
for
six
hundred
years
has
been
the
attitude
of
the
japanese
woman
serving
tea
verily
no
small
part
of
the
life
of
the
woman
of
japan
is
spent
thus
in
serving
little
cups
of
tea
even
as
a
ghost
she
appears
in
popular
prints
offering
to
somebody
spectral
of
spectral
tea
of
all
japanese
i
know
of
none
more
pathetic
than
that
in
which
the
phantom
of
a
woman
kneeling
humbly
offers
to
her
haunted
and
remorseful
murderer
a
little
cup
of
tea
let
us
go
to
the
says
akira
rising
must
go
there
herself
soon
and
it
is
already
getting
dark
sayonara
it
is
indeed
almost
dark
as
we
leave
the
little
house
stars
are
pointing
in
the
strip
of
sky
above
the
street
but
it
is
a
beautiful
night
for
a
walk
with
a
tepid
breeze
blowing
at
intervals
and
sending
long
flutterings
through
the
miles
of
shop
draperies
the
market
is
in
the
narrow
street
at
the
verge
of
the
city
just
below
the
hill
where
the
great
buddhist
temple
of
stands
in
the
motomachi
only
ten
squares
away
sec
the
curious
narrow
street
is
one
long
blaze
of
lights
lights
of
lantern
signs
lights
of
torches
and
lamps
illuminating
unfamiliar
rows
of
little
stands
and
booths
set
out
in
the
thoroughfare
before
all
the
on
each
side
making
two
lines
of
fire
between
these
moves
a
dense
throng
filling
the
night
with
a
clatter
of
geta
that
drowns
even
the
murmuring
of
voices
and
the
cries
of
the
merchant
but
how
gentle
the
movement
there
is
no
jostling
no
rudeness
everybody
even
the
weakest
and
smallest
has
a
chance
to
see
everything
and
there
are
many
things
to
see
here
are
the
venders
of
for
the
tombs
and
the
altars
of
lotus
leaves
in
which
to
wrap
the
food
of
the
beloved
ghosts
the
leaves
folded
into
bundles
are
heaped
upon
tiny
tables
the
buds
and
blossoms
intermingled
are
fixed
upright
in
immense
bunches
supported
by
light
frames
of
bamboo
white
sheaves
of
long
peeled
rods
these
are
the
thinner
ends
can
be
broken
up
into
hashi
for
the
use
of
the
ghosts
the
rest
must
be
consumed
in
the
mukaebi
rightly
all
these
sticks
should
be
made
of
pine
but
pine
is
too
scarce
and
dear
for
the
poor
folk
of
this
district
so
the
ogara
are
substituted
the
dishes
of
the
ghosts
small
red
shallow
platters
of
unglazed
earthenware
primeval
pottery
eh
what
is
all
this
a
little
booth
shaped
like
a
all
made
of
laths
covered
with
a
chess
pattern
of
paper
and
out
of
this
frail
structure
issues
a
shrilling
keen
as
the
sound
of
leaking
steam
that
is
only
insects
says
akira
laughing
to
do
with
the
bonku
insects
yes
in
cages
the
shrilling
is
made
by
scores
of
huge
green
crickets
each
prisoned
in
a
tiny
bamboo
cage
by
itself

fed
with
eggplant
and
melon
rind
continues
akira
sold
to
children
to
play
with
and
there
are
also
beautiful
little
cages
full
of
fireflies
cages
covered
with
brown
upon
each
of
which
some
simple
but
very
pretty
design
in
bright
colours
has
been
dashed
by
a
japanese
brush

here
on
a
street
corner
squats
a
boy
behind
a
low
wooden
table
selling
wooden
boxes
about
as
big
as
with
red
paper
hinges
beside
the
piles
of
these
little
boxes
on
the
table
are
shallow
dishes
filled
with
clear
water
in
which
extraordinary
thin
flat
shapes
are
floating

of
flowers

men
and
women
open
a
box
it
costs
only
two
cents
inside
wrapped
in
tissue
paper
are
bundles
of
little
pale
sticks
like
round
with
pink
ends
drop
one
into
the
water
it
instantly
unrolls
and
expands
into
the
likeness
of
a
another

itself
into
a
fish
a
third
becomes
a
boat
a
fourth
changes
to
an
owl
a
fifth
becomes
a
covered
with
leaves
and
blossoms
so
delicate
are
these
things
that
once
immersed
you
can
not
handle
them
without
breaking
them
they
are
made
of
seaweed
hana
the
sellers
of
artificial
flowers
marvellous
chrysanthemums
and
of
paper
imitations
of
bud
and
leaf
and
flower
so
cunningly
wrought
that
the
eye
alone
can
not
detect
the
beautiful
trickery
it
is
only
right
that
these
should
cost
much
more
than
their
living
counterparts
sec
high
above
the
thronging
and
the
clamour
and
the
myriad
fires
of
the
merchants
the
great
shingon
temple
at
the
end
of
the
radiant
street
towers
upon
its
hill
against
the
starry
night
weirdly
like
a
dream
strangely
illuminated
by
rows
of
paper
lanterns
hung
all
along
its
curving
eaves
and
the
flowing
of
the
crowd
bears
me
thither
out
of
the
broad
entrance
over
a
dark
gliding
mass
which
i
know
to
be
heads
and
shoulders
of
crowding
worshippers
beams
a
broad
band
of
yellow
light
and
before
reaching
the
steps
i
hear
the
continuous
clanging
of
the
temple
gong
each
clang
the
signal
of
an
offering
and
a
prayer
doubtless
a
cataract
of
cash
is
pouring
into
the
great
for
is
the
festival
of
the
physician
of
souls
borne
to
the
steps
at
last
i
find
myself
able
to
halt
a
moment
despite
the
pressure
of
the
throng
before
the
stand
of
a
selling
the
most
beautiful
lanterns
that
i
have
ever
seen
each
is
a
gigantic
of
paper
so
perfectly
made
in
every
detail
as
to
seem
a
great
living
blossom
freshly
plucked
the
petals
are
crimson
at
their
bases
paling
to
white
at
their
tips
the
calyx
is
a
faultless
mimicry
of
nature
and
beneath
it
hangs
a
beautiful
fringe
of
paper
cuttings
coloured
with
the
colours
of
the
flower
green
below
the
calyx
white
in
the
middle
crimson
at
the
ends
in
the
heart
of
the
blossom
is
set
a
microscopic
of
baked
clay
and
this
being
lighted
all
the
flower
becomes
luminous
diaphanous
a
lotus
of
white
and
crimson
fire
there
is
a
slender
gilded
wooden
hoop
by
which
to
hang
it
up
and
the
price
is
four
cents
how
can
people
afford
to
make
such
things
for
four
cents
even
in
this
country
of
astounding
cheapness
akira
is
trying
to
tell
me
something
about
the
the
hundred
and
eight
fires
to
be
lighted
evening
which
bear
some
figurative
relation
unto
the
hundred
and
eight
foolish
desires
but
i
can
not
hear
him
for
the
clatter
of
the
geta
and
the
komageta
the
wooden
clogs
and
wooden
sandals
of
the
worshippers
ascending
to
the
shrine
of
the
light
straw
sandals
of
the
poorer
men
the
zori
and
the
waraji
are
silent
the
great
clatter
is
really
made
by
the
delicate
feet
of
women
and
girls
balancing
themselves
carefully
upon
their
noisy
geta
and
most
of
these
little
feet
are
clad
with
spotless
tabi
white
as
a
white
lotus
white
feet
of
little
mothers
they
mostly
are
mothers
climbing
patiently
and
smilingly
with
pretty
placid
babies
at
their
backs
up
the
hill
to
buddha
and
while
through
the
tinted
lantern
light
i
wander
on
with
the
gentle
noisy
people
up
the
great
steps
of
stone
between
other
displays
of
between
other
high
hedgerows
of
paper
flowers
my
thought
suddenly
goes
back
to
the
little
broken
shrine
in
the
poor
woman
room
with
the
humble
playthings
hanging
before
it
and
the
laughing
twirling
mask
of
otafuku
i
see
the
happy
funny
little
eyes
oblique
and
like
otafuku
own
which
used
to
look
at
those
toys
toys
in
which
the
fresh
found
a
charm
that
i
can
but
faintly
divine
a
delight
hereditary
ancestral
i
see
the
tender
little
creature
being
borne
as
it
was
doubtless
borne
many
times
through
just
such
a
peaceful
throng
as
this
in
just
such
a
lukewarm
luminous
night
peeping
over
the
mother
shoulder
softly
clinging
at
her
neck
with
tiny
hands
somewhere
among
this
multitude
she
is
the
mother
she
will
feel
again
the
faint
touch
of
little
hands
yet
will
not
turn
her
head
to
look
and
laugh
as
in
other
days
chapter
six
sec
over
the
mountains
to
izumo
the
land
of
the
kamiyo
the
land
of
the
ancient
gods
a
journey
of
four
days
by
kuruma
with
strong
runners
from
the
pacific
to
the
sea
of
japan
for
we
have
taken
the
longest
and
least
frequented
route
through
valleys
most
of
this
long
route
lies
valleys
always
open
to
higher
valleys
while
the
road
ascends
valleys
between
mountains
with
ascending
their
slopes
by
successions
of
diked
terraces
which
look
like
enormous
green
flights
of
steps
above
them
are
shadowing
sombre
forests
of
cedar
and
pine
and
above
these
wooded
summits
loom
indigo
shapes
of
farther
hills
overtopped
by
peaked
silhouettes
of
vapoury
grey
the
air
is
lukewarm
and
windless
and
distances
are
gauzed
by
delicate
mists
and
in
this
tenderest
of
blue
skies
this
japanese
sky
which
always
seems
to
me
loftier
than
any
other
sky
which
i
ever
saw
there
are
only
day
after
day
some
few
filmy
spectral
diaphanous
white
wandering
things
like
ghosts
of
clouds
riding
on
the
wind
but
sometimes
as
the
road
ascends
the
disappear
a
while
fields
of
barley
and
of
indigo
and
of
rye
and
of
cotton
fringe
the
route
for
a
little
space
and
then
it
plunges
into
forest
shadows
above
all
else
the
forests
of
cedar
sometimes
bordering
the
way
are
astonishments
never
outside
of
the
tropics
did
i
see
any
growths
comparable
for
density
and
perpendicularity
with
these
every
trunk
is
straight
and
bare
as
a
pillar
the
whole
front
presents
the
spectacle
of
an
immeasurable
massing
of
pallid
columns
towering
up
into
a
cloud
of
sombre
foliage
so
dense
that
one
can
distinguish
nothing
overhead
but
branchings
lost
in
shadow
and
the
profundities
beyond
the
rare
gaps
in
the
palisade
of
blanched
trunks
are
as
in
dore
pictures
of
fir
woods
no
more
great
towns
only
thatched
villages
nestling
in
the
folds
of
the
hills
each
with
its
buddhist
temple
lifting
a
tilted
roof
of
tiles
above
the
congregation
of
thatched
homesteads
and
its
miya
or
shinto
shrine
with
a
torii
before
it
like
a
great
ideograph
shaped
in
stone
or
wood
but
buddhism
still
dominates
every
hilltop
has
its
tera
and
the
statues
of
buddhas
or
of
bodhisattvas
appear
by
the
roadside
as
we
travel
on
with
the
regularity
of
milestones
often
a
village
tera
is
so
large
that
the
cottages
of
the
rustic
folk
about
it
seem
like
little
and
the
traveller
wonders
how
so
costly
an
edifice
of
prayer
can
be
supported
by
a
community
so
humble
and
everywhere
the
signs
of
the
gentle
faith
appear
its
ideographs
and
symbols
are
chiselled
upon
the
faces
of
the
rocks
its
icons
smile
upon
you
from
every
shadowy
recess
by
the
way
even
the
very
landscape
betimes
would
seem
to
have
been
moulded
by
the
soul
of
it
where
hills
rise
softly
as
a
prayer
and
the
summits
of
some
are
domed
like
the
head
of
shaka
and
the
dark
bossy
frondage
that
clothes
them
might
seem
the
clustering
of
his
curls
but
gradually
with
the
passing
of
the
days
as
we
journey
into
the
loftier
west
i
see
fewer
and
fewer
tera
such
buddhist
temples
as
we
pass
appear
small
and
poor
and
the
wayside
images
become
rarer
and
rarer
but
the
symbols
of
shinto
are
more
numerous
and
the
structure
of
its
miya
larger
and
loftier
and
the
torii
are
visible
everywhere
and
tower
higher
before
the
approaches
to
villages
before
the
entrances
of
courts
guarded
by
strangely
grotesque
lions
and
foxes
of
stone
and
before
stairways
of
old
mossed
rock
upsloping
between
dense
growths
of
ancient
cedar
and
pine
to
shrines
that
moulder
in
the
twilight
of
holy
groves
at
one
little
village
i
see
just
beyond
the
torii
leading
to
a
great
shinto
temple
a
particularly
odd
small
shrine
and
feel
impelled
by
curiosity
to
examine
it
leaning
against
its
closed
doors
are
many
short
gnarled
sticks
in
a
row
miniature
clubs
irreverently
removing
these
and
opening
the
little
doors
akira
bids
me
look
within
i
see
only
a
mask
the
mask
of
a
goblin
a
tengu
grotesque
beyond
description
with
an
enormous
nose
so
grotesque
that
i
feel
remorse
for
having
looked
at
it
the
sticks
are
votive
offerings
by
dedicating
one
to
the
shrine
it
is
believed
that
the
tengu
may
be
induced
to
drive
one
enemies
away
though
they
appear
in
all
japanese
paintings
and
carvings
of
them
the
are
divinities
lesser
divinities
lords
of
the
art
of
fencing
and
the
use
of
all
weapons
and
other
changes
gradually
become
manifest
akira
complains
that
he
can
no
longer
understand
the
language
of
the
people
we
are
traversing
regions
of
dialects
the
houses
are
also
architecturally
different
from
those
of
the
of
the
their
high
thatched
roofs
are
curiously
decorated
with
bundles
of
straw
fastened
to
a
pole
of
bamboo
parallel
with
the
and
elevated
about
a
foot
above
it
the
complexion
of
the
peasantry
is
darker
than
in
the
and
i
see
no
more
of
those
charming
rosy
faces
one
observes
among
the
women
of
the
tokyo
districts
and
the
peasants
wear
different
hats
hats
pointed
like
the
straw
roofs
of
those
little
wayside
temples
curiously
enough
called
an
which
means
a
straw
hat
the
weather
is
more
than
warm
rendering
clothing
oppressive
and
as
we
pass
through
the
little
villages
along
the
road
i
see
much
healthy
cleanly
nudity
pretty
naked
children
brown
men
and
boys
with
only
a
soft
narrow
white
cloth
about
their
loins
asleep
on
the
matted
floors
all
the
paper
screens
of
the
houses
having
been
removed
to
admit
the
breeze
the
men
seem
to
be
lightly
and
supply
built
but
i
see
no
saliency
of
muscles
the
lines
of
the
figure
are
always
smooth
before
almost
every
dwelling
indigo
spread
out
upon
little
mats
of
rice
straw
may
be
seen
drying
in
the
sun
the
gaze
wonderingly
at
the
foreigner
at
various
places
where
we
halt
old
men
approach
to
touch
my
clothes
apologising
with
humble
bows
and
winning
smiles
for
their
very
natural
curiosity
and
asking
my
interpreter
all
sorts
of
odd
questions
gentler
and
kindlier
faces
i
never
beheld
and
they
reflect
the
souls
behind
them
never
yet
have
i
heard
a
voice
raised
in
anger
nor
observed
an
unkindly
act
and
each
day
as
we
travel
the
country
becomes
more
beautiful
beautiful
with
that
fantasticality
of
landscape
only
to
be
found
in
volcanic
lands
but
for
the
dark
forests
of
cedar
and
pine
and
this
far
faint
dreamy
sky
and
the
soft
whiteness
of
the
light
there
are
moments
of
our
journey
when
i
could
fancy
myself
again
in
the
west
indies
ascending
some
winding
way
over
the
mornes
of
dominica
or
of
martinique
and
indeed
i
find
myself
sometimes
looking
against
the
horizon
glow
for
shapes
of
palms
and
ceibas
but
the
brighter
green
of
the
valleys
and
of
the
beneath
the
woods
is
not
the
green
of
young
cane
but
of
thousands
upon
thousands
of
tiny
no
larger
than
cottage
gardens
separated
from
each
other
by
narrow
serpentine
dikes
sec
in
the
very
heart
of
a
mountain
range
while
rolling
along
the
verge
of
a
precipice
above
i
catch
sight
of
a
little
shrine
in
a
cavity
of
the
cliff
overhanging
the
way
and
halt
to
examine
it
the
sides
and
sloping
roof
of
the
shrine
are
formed
by
slabs
of
unhewn
rock
within
smiles
a
rudely
chiselled
image
of
and
before
it
bunches
of
wild
flowers
have
been
placed
and
an
earthen
and
scattered
offerings
of
dry
rice
contrary
to
the
idea
suggested
by
the
strange
name
this
form
of
kwannon
is
not
but
the
head
of
a
horse
is
sculptured
upon
the
tiara
worn
by
the
divinity
and
the
symbolism
is
fully
explained
by
a
large
wooden
sotoba
planted
beside
the
shrine
and
bearing
among
other
inscriptions
the
words
bosatsu
giu
ba
bodai
han
ye
for
protects
the
horses
and
the
cattle
of
the
peasant
and
he
prays
her
not
only
that
his
dumb
servants
may
be
preserved
from
sickness
but
also
that
their
spirits
may
enter
after
death
into
a
happier
state
of
existence
near
the
sotoba
there
has
been
erected
a
wooden
framework
about
four
feet
square
filled
with
little
tablets
of
pine
set
edge
to
edge
so
as
to
form
one
smooth
surface
and
on
these
are
written
in
rows
of
hundreds
the
names
of
all
who
subscribed
for
the
statue
and
its
shrine
the
number
announced
is
ten
thousand
but
the
whole
cost
could
not
have
exceeded
ten
japanese
dollars
yen
wherefore
i
surmise
that
each
subscriber
gave
not
more
than
one
rin
one
tenth
of
one
sen
or
cent
for
the
hyakusho
are
unspeakably
poor
in
the
midst
of
these
mountain
solitudes
the
discovery
of
that
little
shrine
creates
a
delightful
sense
of
security
surely
nothing
save
goodness
can
be
expected
from
a
people
enough
to
pray
for
the
souls
of
their
horses
and
cows
as
we
proceed
rapidly
down
a
slope
my
kurumaya
swerves
to
one
side
with
a
suddenness
that
gives
me
a
violent
start
for
the
road
overlooks
a
sheer
depth
of
several
hundred
feet
it
is
merely
to
avoid
hurting
a
harmless
snake
making
its
way
across
the
path
the
snake
is
so
little
afraid
that
on
reaching
the
edge
of
the
road
it
turns
its
head
to
look
after
us
sec
and
now
strange
signs
begin
to
appear
in
all
these
i
see
everywhere
sticking
up
above
the
ripening
grain
objects
like
arrows
arrows
of
prayer
i
take
one
up
to
examine
it
the
shaft
is
a
thin
bamboo
split
down
for
about
of
its
length
into
the
slit
a
strip
of
strong
white
paper
with
ideographs
upon
it
an
ofuda
a
shinto
charm
is
inserted
and
the
separated
ends
of
the
cane
are
then
rejoined
and
tied
together
just
above
it
the
whole
at
a
little
distance
has
exactly
the
appearance
of
a
long
light
arrow
that
which
i
first
examine
bears
the
words
from
the
god
whose
shrine
is
before
the
village
of
peace
another
reads
signifying
that
the
deity
of
the
temple
granteth
fully
every
supplication
made
unto
him
everywhere
as
we
proceed
i
see
the
white
arrows
of
prayer
glimmering
above
the
green
level
of
the
grain
and
always
they
become
more
numerous
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
the
fields
are
sprinkled
with
them
so
that
they
make
upon
the
verdant
surface
a
white
speckling
as
of
flowers
sometimes
also
around
a
little
i
see
a
sort
of
magical
fence
formed
by
little
bamboo
rods
supporting
a
long
cord
from
which
long
straws
hang
down
like
a
fringe
and
paper
cuttings
which
are
symbols
gohei
are
suspended
at
regular
intervals
this
is
the
shimenawa
sacred
emblem
of
shinto
within
the
consecrated
space
inclosed
by
it
no
blight
may
enter
no
scorching
sun
wither
the
young
shoots
and
where
the
white
arrows
glimmer
the
locust
shall
not
prevail
nor
shall
hungry
birds
do
evil
but
now
i
look
in
vain
for
the
buddhas
no
more
great
tera
no
shaka
no
amida
no
even
the
bosatsu
have
been
left
behind
kwannon
and
her
holy
kin
have
disappeared
koshin
lord
of
roads
is
indeed
yet
with
us
but
he
has
changed
his
name
and
become
a
shinto
deity
he
is
now
and
his
presence
is
revealed
only
by
the
statues
of
the
three
mystic
apes
which
are
his
servants
mizaru
who
sees
no
evil
covering
his
eyes
with
his
hands
kikazaru
who
hears
no
evil
covering
his
ears
with
his
hands
iwazaru
who
speaks
no
evil
covering
his
mouth
with
his
hands
yet
no
one
bosatsu
survives
in
this
atmosphere
of
magical
shinto
still
by
the
roadside
i
see
at
long
intervals
the
image
of
the
charming
playfellow
of
dead
children
but
jizo
also
is
a
little
changed
even
in
his
sextuple
representation
the
he
appears
not
standing
but
seated
upon
his
and
i
see
no
stones
piled
up
before
him
as
in
the
eastern
provinces
sec
at
last
from
the
verge
of
an
enormous
ridge
the
roadway
suddenly
slopes
down
into
a
vista
of
high
peaked
roofs
of
thatch
and
eaves
into
a
village
like
a
coloured
print
out
of
old
a
village
with
all
its
tints
and
colours
precisely
like
the
tints
and
colours
of
the
landscape
in
which
it
lies
this
is
in
the
land
of
hoki
we
halt
before
a
quiet
dingy
little
inn
whose
host
a
very
aged
man
comes
forth
to
salute
me
while
a
silent
gentle
crowd
of
villagers
mostly
children
and
women
gather
about
the
kuruma
to
see
the
stranger
to
wonder
at
him
even
to
touch
his
clothes
with
timid
smiling
curiosity
one
glance
at
the
face
of
the
old
innkeeper
decides
me
to
accept
his
invitation
i
must
remain
here
until
my
runners
are
too
wearied
to
go
farther
as
the
little
inn
seemed
without
it
is
delightful
within
its
polished
stairway
and
balconies
are
speckless
reflecting
like
the
bare
feet
of
the
its
luminous
rooms
are
fresh
and
as
when
their
soft
mattings
were
first
laid
down
the
carven
pillars
of
the
alcove
toko
in
my
chamber
leaves
and
flowers
chiselled
in
some
black
rich
wood
are
wonders
and
the
kakemono
or
hanging
there
is
an
idyll
hotei
god
of
happiness
drifting
in
a
bark
down
some
shadowy
stream
into
evening
mysteries
of
vapoury
purple
far
as
this
hamlet
is
from
all
there
is
no
object
visible
in
the
house
which
does
not
reveal
the
japanese
sense
of
beauty
in
form
the
old
the
astonishing
box
in
which
sweetmeats
kwashi
are
kept
the
diaphanous
porcelain
dashed
with
a
single
tiny
gold
figure
of
a
leaping
shrimp
the
holders
which
are
curled
of
bronze
even
the
iron
kettle
with
its
figurings
of
dragons
and
clouds
and
the
brazen
hibachi
whose
handles
are
heads
of
buddhist
lions
delight
the
eye
and
surprise
the
fancy
indeed
wherever
in
japan
one
sees
something
totally
uninteresting
in
porcelain
or
metal
something
commonplace
and
ugly
one
may
be
almost
sure
that
detestable
something
has
been
shaped
under
foreign
influence
but
here
i
am
in
ancient
japan
probably
no
european
eyes
ever
looked
upon
these
things
before
a
window
shaped
like
a
heart
peeps
out
upon
the
garden
a
wonderful
little
garden
with
a
tiny
pond
and
miniature
bridges
and
dwarf
trees
like
the
landscape
of
a
also
some
shapely
stones
of
course
and
some
graceful
or
toro
such
as
are
placed
in
the
courts
of
temples
and
beyond
these
through
the
warm
dusk
i
see
lights
coloured
lights
the
lanterns
of
the
bonku
suspended
before
each
home
to
welcome
the
coming
of
beloved
ghosts
for
by
the
antique
calendar
according
to
which
in
this
antique
place
the
reckoning
of
time
is
still
made
this
is
the
first
night
of
the
festival
of
the
dead
as
in
all
the
other
little
country
villages
where
i
have
been
stopping
i
find
the
people
here
kind
to
me
with
a
kindness
and
a
courtesy
unimaginable
indescribable
unknown
in
any
other
country
and
even
in
japan
itself
only
in
the
interior
their
simple
politeness
is
not
an
art
their
goodness
is
absolutely
unconscious
goodness
both
come
straight
from
the
heart
and
before
i
have
been
two
hours
among
these
people
their
treatment
of
me
coupled
with
the
sense
of
my
utter
inability
to
repay
such
kindness
causes
a
wicked
wish
to
come
into
my
mind
i
wish
these
charming
folk
would
do
me
some
unexpected
wrong
something
surprisingly
evil
something
atrociously
unkind
so
that
i
should
not
be
obliged
to
regret
them
which
i
feel
sure
i
must
begin
to
do
as
soon
as
i
go
away
while
the
aged
landlord
conducts
me
to
the
bath
where
he
insists
upon
washing
me
himself
as
if
i
were
a
child
the
wife
prepares
for
us
a
charming
little
repast
of
rice
eggs
vegetables
and
sweetmeats
she
is
painfully
in
doubt
about
her
ability
to
please
me
even
after
i
have
eaten
enough
for
two
men
and
apologises
too
much
for
not
being
able
to
offer
me
more
is
no
fish
she
says
is
the
first
day
of
the
bonku
the
festival
of
the
dead
being
the
thirteenth
day
of
the
month
on
the
thirteenth
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
of
the
month
nobody
may
eat
fish
but
on
the
morning
of
the
sixteenth
day
the
fishermen
go
out
to
catch
fish
and
everybody
who
has
both
parents
living
may
eat
of
it
but
if
one
has
lost
one
father
or
mother
then
one
must
not
eat
fish
even
upon
the
sixteenth
day
while
the
good
soul
is
thus
explaining
i
become
aware
of
a
strange
remote
sound
from
without
a
sound
i
recognise
through
memory
of
tropical
dances
a
measured
clapping
of
hands
but
this
clapping
is
very
soft
and
at
long
intervals
and
at
still
longer
intervals
there
comes
to
us
a
heavy
muffled
booming
the
tap
of
a
great
drum
a
temple
drum
we
must
go
to
see
it
cries
akira
is
the
the
dance
of
the
festival
of
the
dead
and
you
will
see
the
danced
here
as
it
is
never
danced
in
cities
the
of
ancient
days
for
customs
have
not
changed
here
but
in
the
cities
all
is
changed
so
i
hasten
out
wearing
only
like
the
people
about
me
one
of
those
light
summer
robes
yukata
which
are
furnished
to
male
guests
at
all
japanese
hotels
but
the
air
is
so
warm
that
even
thus
lightly
clad
i
find
myself
slightly
perspiring
and
the
night
is
divine
still
clear
vaster
than
nights
of
europe
with
a
big
white
moon
flinging
down
queer
shadows
of
tilted
eaves
and
horned
gables
and
delightful
silhouettes
of
robed
japanese
a
little
boy
the
grandson
of
our
host
leads
the
way
with
a
crimson
paper
lantern
and
the
sonorous
echoing
of
geta
the
of
wooden
sandals
fills
all
the
street
for
many
are
going
whither
we
are
going
to
see
the
dance
a
little
while
we
proceed
along
the
main
street
then
traversing
a
narrow
passage
between
two
houses
we
find
ourselves
in
a
great
open
space
flooded
by
moonlight
this
is
the
but
the
dance
has
ceased
for
a
time
looking
about
me
i
perceive
that
we
are
in
the
court
of
an
ancient
buddhist
temple
the
temple
building
itself
remains
intact
a
low
long
peaked
silhouette
against
the
starlight
but
it
is
void
and
dark
and
unhallowed
now
it
has
been
turned
they
tell
me
into
a
schoolhouse
the
priests
are
gone
the
great
bell
is
gone
the
buddhas
and
the
bodhisattvas
have
vanished
all
save
one
a
jizo
of
stone
smiling
with
eyelids
closed
under
the
moon
in
the
centre
of
the
court
is
a
framework
of
bamboo
supporting
a
great
drum
and
about
it
benches
have
been
arranged
benches
from
the
schoolhouse
on
which
villagers
are
resting
there
is
a
hum
of
voices
voices
of
people
speaking
very
low
as
if
expecting
something
solemn
and
cries
of
children
betimes
and
soft
laughter
of
girls
and
far
behind
the
court
beyond
a
low
hedge
of
sombre
evergreen
shrubs
i
see
soft
white
lights
and
a
host
of
tall
grey
shapes
throwing
long
shadows
and
i
know
that
the
lights
are
the
white
lanterns
of
the
dead
those
hung
in
cemeteries
only
and
that
the
grey
shapes
are
shapes
of
tombs
suddenly
a
girl
rises
from
her
seat
and
taps
the
huge
drum
once
it
is
the
signal
for
the
dance
of
souls
sec
out
of
the
shadow
of
the
temple
a
processional
line
of
dancers
files
into
the
moonlight
and
as
suddenly
halts
all
young
women
or
girls
clad
in
their
choicest
attire
the
tallest
leads
her
comrades
follow
in
order
of
stature
little
maids
of
ten
or
twelve
years
compose
the
end
of
the
procession
figures
lightly
poised
as
birds
figures
that
somehow
recall
the
dreams
of
shapes
circling
about
certain
antique
vases
those
charming
japanese
robes
about
the
knees
might
seem
but
for
the
great
fantastic
drooping
sleeves
and
the
curious
broad
girdles
confining
them
designed
after
the
drawing
of
some
greek
or
etruscan
artist
and
at
another
tap
of
the
drum
there
begins
a
performance
impossible
to
picture
in
words
something
unimaginable
phantasmal
a
dance
an
astonishment
all
together
glide
the
right
foot
forward
one
pace
without
lifting
the
sandal
from
the
ground
and
extend
both
hands
to
the
right
with
a
strange
floating
motion
and
a
smiling
mysterious
obeisance
then
the
right
foot
is
drawn
back
with
a
repetition
of
the
waving
of
hands
and
the
mysterious
bow
then
all
advance
the
left
foot
and
repeat
the
previous
movements
to
the
left
then
all
take
two
gliding
paces
forward
with
a
single
simultaneous
soft
clap
of
the
hands
and
the
first
performance
is
reiterated
alternately
to
right
and
left
all
the
sandalled
feet
gliding
together
all
the
supple
hands
waving
together
all
the
pliant
bodies
bowing
and
swaying
together
and
so
slowly
weirdly
the
processional
movement
changes
into
a
great
round
circling
about
the
moonlit
court
and
around
the
voiceless
crowd
of
spectators
and
always
the
white
hands
sinuously
wave
together
as
if
weaving
spells
alternately
without
and
within
the
round
now
with
palms
upward
now
with
palms
downward
and
all
the
elfish
sleeves
hover
duskily
together
with
a
shadowing
as
of
wings
and
all
the
feet
poise
together
with
such
a
rhythm
of
complex
motion
that
in
watching
it
one
feels
a
sensation
of
hypnotism
as
while
striving
to
watch
a
flowing
and
shimmering
of
water
and
this
soporous
allurement
is
intensified
by
a
dead
hush
no
one
speaks
not
even
a
spectator
and
in
the
long
intervals
between
the
soft
clapping
of
hands
one
hears
only
the
shrilling
of
the
crickets
in
the
trees
and
the
of
sandals
lightly
stirring
the
dust
unto
what
i
ask
myself
may
this
be
likened
unto
nothing
yet
it
suggests
some
fancy
of
somnambulism
dreamers
who
dream
themselves
flying
dreaming
upon
their
feet
and
there
comes
to
me
the
thought
that
i
am
looking
at
something
immemorially
old
something
belonging
to
the
unrecorded
beginnings
of
this
oriental
life
perhaps
to
the
crepuscular
kamiyo
itself
to
the
magical
age
of
the
gods
a
symbolism
of
motion
whereof
the
meaning
has
been
forgotten
for
innumerable
years
yet
more
and
more
unreal
the
spectacle
appears
with
its
silent
smilings
with
its
silent
bowings
as
if
obeisance
to
watchers
invisible
and
i
find
myself
wondering
whether
were
i
to
utter
but
a
whisper
all
would
not
vanish
for
ever
save
the
grey
mouldering
court
and
the
desolate
temple
and
the
broken
statue
of
jizo
smiling
always
the
same
mysterious
smile
i
see
upon
the
faces
of
the
dancers
under
the
wheeling
moon
in
the
midst
of
the
round
i
feel
as
one
within
the
circle
of
a
charm
and
verily
this
is
enchantment
i
am
bewitched
bewitched
by
the
ghostly
weaving
of
hands
by
the
rhythmic
gliding
of
feet
above
all
by
the
flitting
of
the
marvellous
sleeves
apparitional
soundless
velvety
as
a
flitting
of
great
tropical
bats
no
nothing
i
ever
dreamed
of
could
be
likened
to
this
and
with
the
consciousness
of
the
ancient
hakaba
behind
me
and
the
weird
invitation
of
its
lanterns
and
the
ghostly
beliefs
of
the
hour
and
the
place
there
creeps
upon
me
a
nameless
tingling
sense
of
being
haunted
but
no
these
gracious
silent
waving
weaving
shapes
are
not
of
the
shadowy
folk
for
whose
coming
the
white
fires
were
kindled
a
strain
of
song
full
of
sweet
clear
quavering
like
the
call
of
a
bird
gushes
from
some
girlish
mouth
and
fifty
soft
voices
join
the
chant
sorota
soroimashita
odorikoga
sorota
soroikite
kita
hare
yukata
to
view
as
ears
of
young
rice
ripening
in
the
field
all
clad
alike
in
summer
festal
robes
the
company
of
dancers
have
assembled
again
only
the
shrilling
of
the
crickets
the
of
feet
the
gentle
clapping
and
the
wavering
hovering
measure
proceeds
in
silence
with
mesmeric
lentor
with
a
strange
grace
which
by
its
very
naivete
seems
old
as
the
encircling
hills
those
who
sleep
the
sleep
of
centuries
out
there
under
the
grey
stones
where
the
white
lanterns
are
and
their
fathers
and
the
fathers
of
their
fathers
fathers
and
the
unknown
generations
behind
them
buried
in
cemeteries
of
which
the
place
has
been
forgotten
for
a
thousand
years
doubtless
looked
upon
a
scene
like
this
nay
the
dust
stirred
by
those
young
feet
was
human
life
and
so
smiled
and
so
sang
under
this
moon
woven
paces
and
with
waving
hands
suddenly
a
deep
male
chant
breaks
the
hush
two
giants
have
joined
the
round
and
now
lead
it
two
superb
young
mountain
peasants
nearly
nude
towering
head
and
shoulders
above
the
whole
of
the
assembly
their
kimono
are
rolled
about
their
waistilike
girdles
leaving
their
bronzed
limbs
and
torsos
naked
to
the
warm
air
they
wear
nothing
else
save
their
immense
straw
hats
and
white
tabi
donned
expressly
for
the
festival
never
before
among
these
people
saw
i
such
men
such
thews
but
their
smiling
beardless
faces
are
comely
and
kindly
as
those
of
japanese
boys
they
seem
brothers
so
like
in
frame
in
movement
in
the
timbre
of
their
voices
as
they
intone
the
same
song
no
demo
yama
demo
ko
wa
umiokeyo
sen
ryo
kura
yori
ko
ga
takara
brought
forth
upon
the
mountain
or
in
the
field
it
matters
nothing
more
than
a
treasure
of
one
thousand
ryo
a
baby
precious
is
and
jizo
the
lover
of
children
ghosts
smiles
across
the
silence
souls
close
to
nature
soul
are
these
artless
and
touching
their
thought
like
the
worship
of
that
kishibojin
to
whom
wives
pray
and
after
the
silence
the
sweet
thin
voices
of
the
women
answer
oomu
otoko
ni
sowa
sanu
oya
wa
qyade
gozaranu
ko
no
kataki
parents
who
will
not
allow
their
girl
to
be
united
with
her
lover
they
are
not
the
parents
but
the
enemies
of
their
child
and
song
follows
song
and
the
round
ever
becomes
larger
and
the
hours
pass
unfelt
unheard
while
the
moon
wheels
slowly
down
the
blue
steeps
of
the
night
a
deep
low
boom
rolls
suddenly
across
the
court
the
rich
tone
of
some
temple
bell
telling
the
twelfth
hour
instantly
the
witchcraft
ends
like
the
wonder
of
some
dream
broken
by
a
sound
the
chanting
ceases
the
round
dissolves
in
an
outburst
of
happy
laughter
and
chatting
and
callings
of
which
are
names
of
girls
and
farewell
cries
of
as
dancers
and
spectators
alike
betake
themselves
homeward
with
a
great
of
getas
and
i
moving
with
the
throng
in
the
bewildered
manner
of
one
suddenly
roused
from
sleep
know
myself
ungrateful
these
folk
who
now
toddle
along
beside
me
upon
their
noisy
little
clogs
stepping
very
fast
to
get
a
peep
at
my
foreign
face
these
but
a
moment
ago
were
visions
of
archaic
grace
illusions
of
necromancy
delightful
phantoms
and
i
feel
a
vague
resentment
against
them
for
thus
materialising
into
simple
sec
lying
down
to
rest
i
ask
myself
the
reason
of
the
singular
emotion
inspired
by
that
simple
utterly
impossible
to
recall
the
air
with
its
fantastic
intervals
and
fractional
tones
as
well
attempt
to
fix
in
memory
the
purlings
of
a
bird
but
the
indefinable
charm
of
it
lingers
with
me
still
melodies
of
europe
awaken
within
us
feelings
we
can
utter
sensations
familiar
as
inherited
from
all
the
generations
behind
us
but
how
explain
the
emotion
evoked
by
a
primitive
chant
totally
unlike
anything
in
western
melody
impossible
even
to
write
in
those
tones
which
are
the
ideographs
of
our
and
the
emotion
itself
what
is
it
i
know
not
yet
i
feel
it
to
be
something
infinitely
more
old
than
i
something
not
of
only
one
place
or
time
but
vibrant
to
all
common
joy
or
pain
of
being
under
the
universal
sun
then
i
wonder
if
the
secret
does
not
lie
in
some
untaught
spontaneous
harmony
of
that
chant
with
nature
most
ancient
song
in
some
unconscious
kinship
to
the
music
of
solitudes
all
trillings
of
summer
life
that
blend
to
make
the
great
sweet
cry
of
the
land
chapter
seven
the
chief
city
of
the
province
of
the
gods
sec
the
first
of
the
noises
of
a
matsue
day
comes
to
the
sleeper
like
the
throbbing
of
a
slow
enormous
pulse
exactly
under
his
ear
it
is
a
great
soft
dull
buffet
of
sound
like
a
heartbeat
in
its
regularity
in
its
muffled
depth
in
the
way
it
quakes
up
through
one
pillow
so
as
to
be
felt
rather
than
heard
it
is
simply
the
pounding
of
the
ponderous
pestle
of
the
kometsuki
the
cleaner
of
rice
a
sort
of
colossal
wooden
mallet
with
a
handle
about
fifteen
feet
long
horizontally
balanced
on
a
pivot
by
treading
with
all
his
force
on
the
end
of
the
handle
the
naked
kometsuki
elevates
the
pestle
which
is
then
allowed
to
fall
back
by
its
own
weight
into
the
the
measured
muffled
echoing
of
its
fall
seems
to
me
the
most
pathetic
of
all
sounds
of
japanese
life
it
is
the
beating
indeed
of
the
pulse
of
the
land
then
the
boom
of
the
great
bell
of
tokoji
the
zenshu
temple
shakes
over
the
town
then
come
melancholy
echoes
of
drumming
from
the
tiny
little
temple
of
jizo
in
the
street
zaimokucho
near
my
house
signalling
the
buddhist
hour
of
morning
prayer
and
finally
the
cries
of
the
earliest
itinerant
venders
begin
the
sellers
of
daikon
and
other
strange
vegetables
the
plaintive
call
of
the
women
who
sell
little
thin
slips
of
for
the
lighting
of
charcoal
fires
sec
roused
thus
by
these
earliest
sounds
of
the
city
wakening
life
i
slide
open
my
little
japanese
paper
window
to
look
out
upon
the
morning
over
a
soft
green
cloud
of
spring
foliage
rising
from
the
garden
below
before
me
tremulously
mirroring
everything
upon
its
farther
side
glimmers
the
broad
glassy
mouth
of
the
ohashigawa
opening
into
the
grand
shinji
lake
which
spreads
out
broadly
to
the
right
in
a
dim
grey
frame
of
peaks
just
opposite
to
me
across
the
stream
the
japanese
dwellings
have
their
to
all
closed
they
are
still
shut
up
like
boxes
for
it
is
not
yet
sunrise
although
it
is
day
but
oh
the
charm
of
the
vision
those
first
ghostly
of
a
morning
steeped
in
mist
soft
as
sleep
itself
resolved
into
a
visible
exhalation
long
reaches
of
vapour
cloud
the
far
lake
verge
long
nebulous
bands
such
as
you
may
have
seen
in
old
japanese
and
must
have
deemed
only
artistic
whimsicalities
unless
you
had
previously
looked
upon
the
real
phenomena
all
the
bases
of
the
mountains
are
veiled
by
them
and
they
stretch
athwart
the
loftier
peaks
at
different
heights
like
immeasurable
lengths
of
gauze
this
singular
appearance
the
japanese
term
so
that
the
lake
appears
incomparably
larger
than
it
really
is
and
not
an
actual
lake
but
a
beautiful
spectral
sea
of
the
same
tint
as
the
and
mixing
with
it
while
rise
like
islands
from
the
brume
and
visionary
strips
of
figure
as
causeways
stretching
out
of
sight
an
exquisite
chaos
aspect
as
the
delicate
fogs
rise
slowly
very
slowly
as
the
sun
yellow
rim
comes
into
sight
fine
thin
lines
of
warmer
tone
spectral
violets
and
opalines
shoot
across
the
flood
treetops
take
tender
fire
and
the
unpainted
façades
of
high
edifices
across
the
water
change
their
to
vapoury
gold
through
the
delicious
haze
looking
sunward
up
the
long
ohashigawa
beyond
the
wooden
bridge
one
junk
just
hoisting
sail
seems
to
me
the
most
fantastically
beautiful
craft
i
ever
saw
a
dream
of
orient
seas
so
idealised
by
the
vapour
is
it
the
ghost
of
a
junk
but
a
ghost
that
catches
the
light
as
clouds
do
a
shape
of
gold
mist
seemingly
and
suspended
in
pale
blue
light
sec
and
now
from
the
touching
my
garden
there
rises
to
me
a
sound
of
clapping
of
hand
one
two
three
four
claps
but
the
owner
of
the
hands
is
screened
from
view
by
the
shrubbery
at
the
same
time
however
i
see
men
and
women
descending
the
stone
steps
of
the
wharves
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
ohashigawa
all
with
little
blue
towels
tucked
into
their
girdles
they
wash
their
faces
and
hands
and
rinse
their
mouths
the
customary
ablution
preliminary
to
shinto
prayer
then
they
turn
their
faces
to
the
sunrise
and
clap
their
hands
four
times
and
pray
from
the
long
high
white
bridge
come
other
clappings
like
echoes
and
others
again
from
far
light
graceful
craft
curved
like
new
moons
extraordinary
boats
in
which
i
see
fishermen
standing
with
foreheads
bowed
to
the
golden
east
now
the
clappings
multiply
multiply
at
last
into
an
almost
continuous
volleying
of
sharp
sounds
for
all
the
population
are
saluting
the
rising
sun
the
lady
of
fire
the
lady
of
the
great
light
hail
this
day
to
thee
divinest
thanks
unutterable
unto
thee
for
this
thy
sweet
light
making
beautiful
the
world
so
the
thought
if
not
the
utterance
of
countless
hearts
some
turn
to
the
sun
only
clapping
their
hands
yet
many
turn
also
to
the
west
to
holy
kitzuki
the
immemorial
shrine
and
not
a
few
turn
their
faces
successively
to
all
the
points
of
heaven
murmuring
the
names
of
a
hundred
gods
and
others
again
after
having
saluted
the
lady
of
fire
look
toward
high
ichibata
toward
the
place
of
the
great
temple
of
yakushi
nyorai
who
giveth
sight
to
the
blind
not
clapping
their
hands
as
in
shinto
worship
but
only
rubbing
the
palms
softly
together
after
the
buddhist
manner
but
all
for
in
this
most
antique
province
of
japan
all
buddhists
are
shintoists
likewise
utter
the
archaic
words
of
shinto
prayer
tamai
kiyome

to
kami

prayer
to
the
most
ancient
gods
who
reigned
before
the
coming
of

buddha
and
who
still
reign
here
in
their
own
in
the
land
of
reed
plains
in
the
place
of
the
issuing
of
clouds
prayer
to
the

brief
indeed
is
my
little
feathered
confession
of
faith
only
the
sacred
name
reiterated
over
and
over
again
like
a
litany
with
liquid
bursts
of
twittering
between
only
this
one
phrase
but
how
deliciously
he
utters
it
with
what
slow
amorous
ecstasy
he
dwells
upon
its
golden
syllables
it
hath
been
written
who
shall
keep

teach
or
write
this
sutra
shall
obtain
eight
hundred
good
qualities
of
the
eye
he
shall
see
the
whole
triple
universe
down
to
the
great
hell
aviki
and
up
to
the
extremity
of
existence
he
shall
obtain
twelve
hundred
good
qualities
of
the
ear
he
shall
hear
all
sounds
in
the
triple
universe
sounds
of
gods
goblins
demons
and
beings
not
human
a
single
word
only
but
it
is
also
written
who
shall
joyfully
accept
but
a
single
word
from
this
sutra
incalculably
greater
shall
be
his
merit
than
the
merit
of
one
who
should
supply
all
beings
in
the
four
hundred
thousand
asankhyeyas
of
worlds
with
all
the
necessaries
for
happiness
always
he
makes
a
reverent
little
pause
after
uttering
it
and
before
shrilling
out
his
ecstatic
warble
his
of
praise
first
the
warble
then
a
pause
of
about
five
seconds
then
a
slow
sweet
solemn
utterance
of
the
holy
name
in
a
tone
as
of
meditative
wonder
then
another
pause
then
another
wild
rich
passionate
warble
could
you
see
him
you
would
marvel
how
so
powerful
and
penetrating
a
soprano
could
ripple
from
so
minute
a
throat
for
he
is
one
of
the
very
tiniest
of
all
feathered
singers
yet
his
chant
can
be
heard
far
across
the
broad
river
and
children
going
to
school
pause
daily
on
the
bridge
a
whole
cho
away
to
listen
to
his
song
and
uncomely
withal
a
mite
almost
lost
in
his
immense
of
hinoki
wood
darkened
with
paper
screens
over
its
little
windows
for
he
loves
the
gloom
delicate
he
is
and
exacting
even
to
tyranny
all
his
diet
must
be
laboriously
triturated
and
weighed
in
scales
and
measured
out
to
him
at
precisely
the
same
hour
each
day
it
demands
all
possible
care
and
attention
merely
to
keep
him
alive
he
is
precious
nevertheless
and
from
the
uttermost
coasts
is
the
price
of
him
so
rare
he
is
indeed
i
could
not
have
afforded
to
buy
him
he
was
sent
to
me
by
one
of
the
sweetest
ladies
in
japan
daughter
of
the
governor
of
izumo
who
thinking
the
foreign
teacher
might
feel
lonesome
during
a
brief
illness
made
him
the
exquisite
gift
of
this
dainty
creature
sec
the
clapping
of
hands
has
ceased
the
toil
of
the
day
begins
continually
louder
and
louder
the
pattering
of
geta
over
the
bridge
it
is
a
sound
never
to
be
forgotten
this
pattering
of
geta
over
the
ohashi
rapid
merry
musical
like
the
sound
of
an
enormous
dance
and
a
dance
it
veritably
is
the
whole
population
is
moving
on
tiptoe
and
the
multitudinous
twinkling
of
feet
over
the
verge
of
the
sunlit
roadway
is
an
astonishment
all
those
feet
are
small
symmetrical
light
as
the
feet
of
figures
painted
on
greek
vases
and
the
step
is
always
taken
toes
first
indeed
with
geta
it
could
be
taken
no
other
way
for
the
heel
touches
neither
the
geta
nor
the
ground
and
the
foot
is
tilted
forward
by
the
wooden
sole
merely
to
stand
upon
a
pair
of
geta
is
difficult
for
one
unaccustomed
to
their
use
yet
you
see
japanese
children
running
at
full
speed
in
geta
with
soles
at
least
three
inches
high
held
to
the
foot
only
by
a
forestrap
fastened
between
the
great
toe
and
the
other
toes
and
they
never
trip
and
the
geta
never
falls
off
still
more
curious
is
the
spectacle
of
men
walking
in
bokkuri
or
takageta
a
wooden
sole
with
wooden
supports
at
least
five
inches
high
fitted
underneath
it
so
as
to
make
the
whole
structure
seem
the
lacquered
model
of
a
wooden
bench
but
the
wearers
stride
as
freely
as
if
they
had
nothing
upon
their
feet
now
children
begin
to
appear
hurrying
to
school
the
undulation
of
the
wide
sleeves
of
their
pretty
speckled
robes
as
they
run
looks
precisely
like
a
fluttering
of
extraordinary
butterflies
the
junks
spread
their
great
white
or
yellow
wings
and
the
funnels
of
the
little
steamers
which
have
been
slumbering
all
night
by
the
wharves
begin
to
smoke
one
of
the
tiny
lake
steamers
lying
at
the
opposite
wharf
has
just
opened
its
to
utter
the
most
unimaginable
piercing
desperate
furious
howl
when
that
cry
is
heard
everybody
laughs
the
other
little
steamboats
utter
only
plaintive
mooings
but
unto
this
particular
vessel
newly
built
and
launched
by
a
rival
company
there
has
been
given
a
voice
expressive
to
the
most
amazing
degree
of
reckless
hostility
and
savage
defiance
the
good
people
of
matsue
upon
hearing
its
voice
for
the
first
time
gave
it
forthwith
a
new
and
just
name
signifies
a
steamship
signifies
a
wolf
sec
a
very
curious
little
object
now
comes
slowly
floating
down
the
river
and
i
do
not
think
that
you
could
possibly
guess
what
it
is
the
hotoke
or
buddhas
and
the
beneficent
kami
are
not
the
only
divinities
worshipped
by
the
japanese
of
the
poorer
classes
the
deities
of
evil
or
at
least
some
of
them
are
duly
propitiated
upon
certain
occasions
and
requited
by
offerings
whenever
they
graciously
vouchsafe
to
inflict
a
temporary
ill
instead
of
an
irremediable
misfortune
after
all
this
is
no
more
irrational
than
the
thanksgiving
prayer
at
the
close
of
the
hurricane
season
in
the
west
indies
after
the
destruction
by
storm
of
thousand
lives
so
men
sometimes
pray
to
ekibiogami
the
god
of
pestilence
and
to
the
god
of
wind
and
of
bad
colds
and
to
the
god
of
smallpox
and
to
divers
evil
genii
now
when
a
person
is
certainly
going
to
get
well
of
smallpox
a
feast
is
given
to
the
much
as
a
feast
is
given
to
the
when
a
possessing
fox
has
promised
to
allow
himself
to
be
cast
out
upon
a
or
small
straw
mat
such
as
is
used
to
close
the
end
of
a
one
or
more
kawarake
or
small
earthenware
vessels
are
placed
these
are
filled
with
a
preparation
of
rice
and
red
beans
called
adzukimeshi
whereof
both
and
are
supposed
to
be
very
fond
little
bamboo
wands
with
gohei
paper
cuttings
fastened
to
them
are
then
planted
either
in
the
mat
or
in
the
adzukimeshi
and
the
colour
of
these
gohei
must
be
red
be
it
observed
that
the
gohei
of
other
kami
are
always
white
this
offering
is
then
either
suspended
to
a
tree
or
set
afloat
in
some
running
stream
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
home
of
the
convalescent
this
is
called
the
god
off
sec
the
long
white
bridge
with
its
pillars
of
iron
is
recognisably
modern
it
was
in
fact
opened
to
the
public
only
last
spring
with
great
ceremony
according
to
some
most
ancient
custom
when
a
new
bridge
has
been
built
the
first
persons
to
pass
over
it
must
be
the
happiest
of
the
community
so
the
authorities
of
matsue
sought
for
the
happiest
folk
and
selected
two
aged
men
who
had
both
been
married
for
more
than
half
a
century
and
who
had
had
not
less
than
twelve
children
and
had
never
lost
any
of
them
these
good
patriarchs
first
crossed
the
bridge
accompanied
by
their
venerable
wives
and
followed
by
their
children
grandchildren
and
amidst
a
great
clamour
of
rejoicing
the
showering
of
fireworks
and
the
firing
of
cannon
but
the
ancient
bridge
so
recently
replaced
by
this
structure
was
much
more
picturesque
curving
across
the
flood
and
supported
upon
multitudinous
feet
like
a
centipede
of
the
innocuous
kind
for
three
hundred
years
it
had
stood
over
the
stream
firmly
and
well
and
it
had
its
particular
tradition
when
horio
yoshiharu
the
great
general
who
became
daimyo
of
izumo
in
the
keicho
era
first
undertook
to
put
a
bridge
over
the
mouth
of
this
river
the
builders
laboured
in
vain
for
there
appeared
to
be
no
solid
bottom
for
the
pillars
of
the
bridge
to
rest
upon
millions
of
great
stones
were
cast
into
the
river
to
no
purpose
for
the
work
constructed
by
day
was
swept
away
or
swallowed
up
by
night
nevertheless
at
last
the
bridge
was
built
but
the
pillars
began
to
sink
soon
after
it
was
finished
then
a
flood
carried
half
of
it
away
and
as
often
as
it
was
repaired
so
often
it
was
wrecked
then
a
human
sacrifice
was
made
to
appease
the
vexed
spirits
of
the
flood
a
man
was
buried
alive
in
the
below
the
place
of
the
middle
pillar
where
the
current
is
most
treacherous
and
thereafter
the
bridge
remained
immovable
for
three
hundred
years
this
victim
was
one
gensuke
who
had
lived
in
the
street
saikamachi
for
it
had
been
determined
that
the
first
man
who
should
cross
the
bridge
wearing
hakama
without
a
machi
should
be
put
under
the
bridge
and
gensuke
sought
to
pass
over
not
having
a
machi
in
his
hakama
so
they
sacrificed
him
wherefore
the
midmost
pillar
of
the
bridge
was
for
three
hundred
years
called
by
his
name
it
is
averred
that
upon
moonless
nights
a
ghostly
fire
flitted
about
that
pillar
always
in
the
dead
watch
hour
between
two
and
three
and
the
colour
of
the
light
was
red
though
i
am
assured
that
in
japan
as
in
other
lands
the
fires
of
the
dead
are
most
often
blue
sec
now
some
say
that
gensuke
was
not
the
name
of
a
man
but
the
name
of
an
era
corrupted
by
local
dialect
into
the
semblance
of
a
personal
appellation
yet
so
profoundly
is
the
legend
believed
that
when
the
new
bridge
was
being
built
thousands
of
country
folk
were
afraid
to
come
to
town
for
a
rumour
arose
that
a
new
victim
was
needed
who
was
to
be
chosen
from
among
them
and
that
it
had
been
determined
to
make
the
choice
from
those
who
still
wore
their
hair
in
queues
after
the
ancient
manner
wherefore
hundreds
of
aged
men
cut
off
their
queues
then
another
rumour
was
circulated
to
the
effect
that
the
police
had
been
secretly
instructed
to
seize
the
person
of
those
who
crossed
the
new
bridge
the
first
day
and
to
treat
him
after
the
manner
of
gensuke
and
at
the
time
of
the
great
festival
of
the
when
the
city
is
usually
thronged
by
farmers
coming
to
worship
at
the
many
shrines
of
inari
this
year
there
came
but
few
and
the
loss
to
local
commerce
was
estimated
at
several
thousand
yen
the
vapours
have
vanished
sharply
revealing
a
beautiful
little
islet
in
the
lake
lying
scarcely
half
a
mile
away
a
low
narrow
strip
of
land
with
a
shinto
shrine
upon
it
shadowed
by
giant
pines
not
pines
like
ours
but
huge
gnarled
shaggy
tortuous
shapes
like
ancient
oaks
through
a
glass
one
can
easily
discern
a
torii
and
before
it
two
symbolic
lions
of
stone
one
with
its
head
broken
off
doubtless
by
its
having
been
overturned
and
dashed
about
by
heavy
waves
during
some
great
storm
this
islet
is
sacred
to
benten
the
goddess
of
eloquence
and
beauty
wherefore
it
is
called
but
it
is
more
commonly
called
or
island
of
the
young
wife
by
reason
of
a
legend
it
is
said
that
it
arose
in
one
night
noiselessly
as
a
dream
bearing
up
from
the
depths
of
the
lake
the
body
of
a
drowned
woman
who
had
been
very
lovely
very
pious
and
very
unhappy
the
people
deeming
this
a
sign
from
heaven
consecrated
the
islet
to
benten
and
thereon
built
a
shrine
unto
her
planted
trees
about
it
set
a
torii
before
it
and
made
a
rampart
about
it
with
great
stones
and
there
they
buried
the
drowned
woman
now
the
sky
is
blue
down
to
the
horizon
the
air
is
a
caress
of
spring
i
go
forth
to
wander
through
the
queer
old
city
sec
i
perceive
that
upon
the
sliding
doors
or
immediately
above
the
principal
entrance
of
nearly
every
house
are
pasted
oblong
white
papers
bearing
ideographic
inscriptions
and
overhanging
every
threshold
i
see
the
sacred
emblem
of
shinto
the
little
rope
with
its
long
fringe
of
pendent
stalks
the
white
papers
at
once
interest
me
for
they
are
ofuda
or
holy
texts
and
charms
of
which
i
am
a
devout
collector
nearly
all
are
from
temples
in
matsue
or
its
vicinity
and
the
buddhist
ones
indicate
by
the
sacred
words
upon
them
to
what
particular
shu
or
sect
the
family
belong
for
nearly
every
soul
in
this
community
professes
some
form
of
buddhism
as
well
as
the
and
more
ancient
faith
of
shinto
and
even
one
quite
ignorant
of
japanese
ideographs
can
nearly
always
distinguish
at
a
glance
the
formula
of
the
great
nichiren
sect
from
the
peculiar
appearance
of
the
column
of
characters
composing
it
all
bristling
with
long
sharp
points
and
banneret
zigzags
like
an
army
the
famous
text
inscribed
of
old
upon
the
flag
of
the
great
captain
kato
kiyomasa
the
extirpator
of
spanish
christianity
the
glorious
vir
ter
execrandus
of
the
jesuits
any
pilgrim
belonging
to
this
sect
has
the
right
to
call
at
whatever
door
bears
the
above
formula
and
ask
for
alms
or
food
but
by
far
the
greater
number
of
the
ofuda
are
shinto
upon
almost
every
door
there
is
one
ofuda
especially
likely
to
attract
the
attention
of
a
stranger
because
at
the
foot
of
the
column
of
ideographs
composing
its
text
there
are
two
small
figures
of
foxes
a
black
and
a
white
fox
facing
each
other
in
a
sitting
posture
each
with
a
little
bunch
of
in
its
mouth
instead
of
the
more
usual
emblematic
key
these
ofuda
are
from
the
great
inari
temple
of
oshiroyama
within
the
castle
grounds
and
are
charms
against
fire
they
represent
indeed
the
only
form
of
assurance
against
fire
yet
known
in
matsue
so
far
at
least
as
wooden
dwellings
are
concerned
and
although
a
single
spark
and
a
high
wind
are
sufficient
in
combination
to
obliterate
a
larger
city
in
one
day
great
fires
are
unknown
in
matsue
and
small
ones
are
of
rare
occurrence
the
charm
is
peculiar
to
the
city
and
of
the
inari
in
question
this
tradition
exists
when
naomasu
the
grandson
of
iyeyasu
first
came
to
matsue
to
rule
the
province
there
entered
into
his
presence
a
beautiful
boy
who
said
came
hither
from
the
home
of
your
august
father
in
echizen
to
protect
you
from
all
harm
but
i
have
no
and
am
staying
therefore
at
the
buddhist
temple
of
now
if
you
will
make
for
me
a
dwelling
within
the
castle
grounds
i
will
protect
from
fire
the
buildings
there
and
the
houses
of
the
city
and
your
other
residence
likewise
which
is
in
the
capital
for
i
am
inari
shinyemon
with
these
words
he
vanished
from
sight
therefore
naomasu
dedicated
to
him
the
great
temple
which
still
stands
in
the
castle
grounds
surrounded
by
one
thousand
foxes
of
stone
sec
i
now
turn
into
a
narrow
little
street
which
although
so
ancient
that
its
dwarfed
houses
have
the
look
of
things
grown
up
from
the
ground
is
called
the
street
of
the
new
timber
new
the
timber
may
have
been
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
but
the
tints
of
the
structures
would
ravish
an
artist
the
sombre
ashen
tones
of
the
woodwork
the
furry
browns
of
old
thatch
ribbed
and
patched
and
edged
with
the
warm
soft
green
of
those
velvety
herbs
and
mosses
which
flourish
upon
japanesese
roofs
however
the
perspective
of
the
street
frames
in
a
vision
more
surprising
than
any
details
of
its
mouldering
homes
between
very
lofty
bamboo
poles
higher
than
any
of
the
dwellings
and
planted
on
both
sides
of
the
street
in
lines
extraordinary
black
nets
are
stretched
like
prodigious
cobwebs
against
the
sky
evoking
sudden
memories
of
those
monster
spiders
which
figure
in
japanese
mythology
and
in
the
of
the
old
artists
but
these
are
only
of
silken
thread
and
this
is
the
street
of
the
fishermen
i
take
my
way
to
the
great
bridge
sec
a
stupendous
ghost
looking
eastward
from
the
great
bridge
over
those
sharply
beautiful
mountains
green
and
blue
which
tooth
the
horizon
i
see
a
glorious
spectre
towering
to
the
sky
its
base
is
effaced
by
far
mists
out
of
the
air
the
thing
would
seem
to
have
shaped
itself
a
phantom
cone
diaphanously
grey
below
vaporously
white
above
with
a
dream
of
perpetual
snow
the
mighty
mountain
of
daisen
at
the
first
approach
of
winter
it
will
in
one
night
become
all
blanched
from
foot
to
crest
and
then
its
snowy
pyramid
so
much
resembles
that
sacred
mountain
often
compared
by
poets
to
a
white
inverted
fan
half
opened
hanging
in
the
sky
that
it
is
called
fuji
of
izumo
but
it
is
really
in
hoki
not
in
izumo
though
it
can
not
be
seen
from
any
part
of
hoki
to
such
advantage
as
from
here
it
is
the
one
sublime
spectacle
of
this
charming
land
but
it
is
visible
only
when
the
air
is
very
pure
many
are
the
marvellous
legends
related
concerning
it
and
somewhere
upon
its
mysterious
summit
the
tengu
are
believed
to
dwell
sec
at
the
farther
end
of
the
bridge
close
to
the
wharf
where
the
little
steamboats
are
is
a
very
small
jizo
temple
here
are
kept
many
bronze
drags
and
whenever
anyone
has
been
drowned
and
the
body
not
recovered
these
are
borrowed
from
the
little
temple
and
the
river
is
dragged
if
the
body
be
thus
found
a
new
drag
must
be
presented
to
the
temple
from
here
half
a
mile
southward
to
the
great
shinto
temple
of
tenjin
deity
of
scholarship
and
calligraphy
broadly
stretches
tenjinmachi
the
street
of
the
rich
merchants
all
draped
on
either
side
with
dark
blue
hangings
over
which
undulate
with
every
windy
palpitation
from
the
lake
white
wondrous
ideographs
which
are
names
and
signs
while
down
the
wide
way
in
white
perspective
diminishes
a
long
line
of
telegraph
poles
beyond
the
temple
of
tenjin
the
city
is
again
divided
by
a
river
the
shindotegawa
over
which
arches
the
bridge
again
beyond
this
other
large
quarters
extend
to
the
hills
and
curve
along
the
lake
shore
but
in
the
space
between
the
two
rivers
is
the
richest
and
busiest
life
of
the
city
and
also
the
vast
and
curious
quarter
of
the
temples
in
this
islanded
district
are
likewise
the
theatres
and
the
place
where
are
held
and
most
of
the
resorts
of
pleasure
parallel
with
tenjinmachi
runs
the
great
street
of
the
buddhist
temples
or
teramachi
of
which
the
eastern
side
is
one
unbroken
succession
of
temples
a
solid
front
of
court
walls
with
imposing
gateways
at
regular
intervals
above
this
long
stretch
of
wall
rise
the
beautiful
tilted
massive
lines
of
temple
roofs
against
the
sky
here
all
the
sects
dwell
side
by
side
in
harmony
nichirenshu
even
that
unpopular
in
izumo
because
those
who
follow
its
teaching
strictly
must
not
worship
the
kami
behind
each
temple
court
there
is
a
cemetery
or
hakaba
and
eastward
beyond
these
are
other
temples
and
beyond
them
yet
others
masses
of
buddhist
architecture
mixed
with
shreds
of
gardens
and
miniature
homesteads
a
huge
labyrinth
of
mouldering
courts
and
fragments
of
streets
as
usual
i
find
i
can
pass
a
few
hours
very
profitably
in
visiting
the
temples
in
looking
at
the
ancient
images
seated
within
the
cups
of
golden
under
their
aureoles
of
gold
in
buying
curious
mamori
in
examining
the
sculptures
of
the
cemeteries
where
i
can
nearly
always
find
some
dreaming
kwannon
or
smiling
jizo
well
worth
the
visit
the
great
courts
of
buddhist
temples
are
places
of
rare
interest
for
one
who
loves
to
watch
the
life
of
the
people
for
these
have
been
for
unremembered
centuries
the
of
the
children
generations
of
happy
infants
have
been
amused
in
them
all
the
nurses
and
little
girls
who
carry
tiny
brothers
or
sisters
upon
their
backs
go
thither
every
morning
that
the
sun
shines
hundreds
of
children
join
them
and
they
play
at
strange
funny
games
or
the
game
of
devil
which
signifies
the
shadow
and
the
demon
and
which
is
a
sort
of
buff
also
during
the
long
summer
evenings
these
temples
are
free
to
all
who
love
wrestling
and
in
many
of
them
there
is
a
or
robust
young
labourers
and
sinewy
artisans
come
to
these
courts
to
test
their
strength
after
the
day
tasks
are
done
and
here
the
fame
of
more
than
one
now
noted
wrestler
was
first
made
when
a
youth
has
shown
himself
able
to
overmatch
at
wrestling
all
others
in
his
own
district
he
is
challenged
by
champions
of
other
districts
and
if
he
can
overcome
these
also
he
may
hope
eventually
to
become
a
skilled
and
popular
professional
wrestler
it
is
also
in
the
temple
courts
that
the
sacred
dances
are
performed
and
that
public
speeches
are
made
it
is
in
the
temple
courts
too
that
the
most
curious
toys
are
sold
on
the
occasion
of
the
great
holidays
toys
most
of
which
have
a
religious
signification
there
are
grand
old
trees
and
ponds
full
of
tame
fish
which
put
up
their
heads
to
beg
for
food
when
your
shadow
falls
upon
the
water
the
holy
lotus
is
cultivated
therein
growing
in
the
foulest
slime
the
flower
remains
pure
and
undefiled
the
soul
of
him
who
remains
ever
pure
in
the
midst
of
temptation
is
likened
unto
the
lotus
is
the
lotus
carven
or
painted
upon
the
furniture
of
temples
therefore
also
does
it
appear
in
all
the
representations
of
our
lord
buddha
paradise
the
blessed
shall
sit
at
ease
enthroned
upon
the
cups
of
golden
a
rings
through
the
quaint
street
and
round
the
corner
of
the
last
temple
come
marching
a
troop
of
handsome
young
riflemen
uniformed
somewhat
like
french
light
infantry
marching
by
fours
so
perfectly
that
all
the
gaitered
legs
move
as
if
belonging
to
a
single
body
and
every
catches
the
sun
at
exactly
the
same
angle
as
the
column
wheels
into
view
these
are
the
students
of
the
the
college
of
teachers
performing
their
daily
military
exercises
their
professors
give
them
lectures
upon
the
microscopic
study
of
cellular
tissues
upon
the
segregation
of
developing
nerve
structure
upon
spectrum
analysis
upon
the
evolution
of
the
colour
sense
and
upon
the
cultivation
of
bacteria
in
glycerine
infusions
and
they
are
none
the
less
modest
and
knightly
in
manner
for
all
their
modern
knowledge
nor
the
less
reverentially
devoted
to
their
dear
old
fathers
and
mothers
whose
ideas
were
shaped
in
the
era
of
feudalism
sec
here
come
a
band
of
pilgrims
with
yellow
straw
overcoats
mino
and
enormous
yellow
straw
hats
of
which
the
rim
partly
hides
the
face
all
carry
staffs
and
wear
their
robes
well
girded
up
so
as
to
leave
free
the
lower
limbs
which
are
inclosed
in
white
cotton
leggings
of
a
peculiar
and
indescribable
kind
precisely
the
same
sort
of
costume
was
worn
by
the
same
class
of
travellers
many
centuries
ago
and
just
as
you
now
see
them
trooping
by
whole
families
wandering
together
the
pilgrim
child
clinging
to
the
father
hands
so
may
you
see
them
pass
in
quaint
procession
across
the
faded
pages
of
japanese
a
hundred
years
old
at
intervals
they
halt
before
some
to
look
at
the
many
curious
things
which
they
greatly
enjoy
seeing
but
which
they
have
no
money
to
buy
i
myself
have
become
so
accustomed
to
surprises
to
interesting
or
extraordinary
sights
that
when
a
day
happens
to
pass
during
which
nothing
remarkable
has
been
heard
or
seen
i
feel
vaguely
discontented
but
such
blank
days
are
rare
they
occur
in
my
own
case
only
when
the
weather
is
too
detestable
to
permit
of
going
for
with
ever
so
little
money
one
can
always
obtain
the
pleasure
of
looking
at
curious
things
and
this
has
been
one
of
the
chief
pleasures
of
the
people
in
japan
for
centuries
and
centuries
for
the
nation
has
passed
its
generations
of
lives
in
making
or
seeking
such
things
to
divert
self
seems
indeed
the
main
purpose
of
japanese
existence
beginning
with
the
opening
of
the
baby
wondering
eyes
the
faces
of
the
people
have
an
indescribable
look
of
patient
expectancy
the
air
of
waiting
for
something
interesting
to
make
its
appearance
if
it
fail
to
appear
they
will
travel
to
find
it
they
are
astonishing
pedestrians
and
tireless
pilgrims
and
i
think
they
make
pilgrimages
not
more
for
the
sake
of
pleasing
the
gods
than
of
pleasing
themselves
by
the
sight
of
rare
and
pretty
things
for
every
temple
is
a
museum
and
every
hill
and
valley
throughout
the
land
has
its
temple
and
its
wonders
even
the
poorest
farmer
one
so
poor
that
he
can
not
afford
to
eat
a
grain
of
his
own
rice
can
afford
to
make
a
pilgrimage
of
a
duration
and
during
that
season
when
the
growing
rice
needs
least
attention
hundreds
of
thousands
of
the
poorest
go
on
pilgrimages
this
is
possible
because
from
ancient
times
it
has
been
the
custom
for
everybody
to
help
pilgrims
a
little
and
they
can
always
find
rest
and
shelter
at
particular
inns
kichinyado
which
receive
pilgrims
only
and
where
they
are
charged
merely
the
cost
of
the
wood
used
to
cook
their
food
but
multitudes
of
the
poor
undertake
pilgrimages
requiring
much
more
than
a
month
to
perform
such
as
the
pilgrimage
to
the
great
temples
of
kwannon
or
that
to
the
temples
of
kobodaishi
and
these
though
years
be
needed
to
accomplish
them
are
as
nothing
compared
to
the
enormous
sengaji
the
pilgrimage
to
the
thousand
temples
of
the
nichiren
sect
the
time
of
a
generation
may
pass
ere
this
can
be
made
one
may
begin
it
in
early
youth
and
complete
it
only
when
youth
is
long
past
yet
there
are
several
in
matsue
men
and
women
who
have
made
this
tremendous
pilgrimage
seeing
all
japan
and
supporting
themselves
not
merely
by
begging
but
by
some
kinds
of
itinerant
peddling
the
pilgrim
who
desires
to
perform
this
pilgrimage
carries
on
his
shoulders
a
small
box
shaped
like
a
buddhist
shrine
in
which
he
keeps
his
spare
clothes
and
food
he
also
carries
a
little
brazen
gong
which
he
constantly
sounds
while
passing
through
a
city
or
village
at
the
same
time
chanting
the
and
he
always
bears
with
him
a
little
blank
book
in
which
the
priest
of
every
temple
visited
stamps
the
temple
seal
in
red
ink
the
pilgrimage
over
this
book
with
its
one
thousand
seal
impressions
becomes
an
heirloom
in
the
family
of
the
pilgrim
sec
i
too
must
make
divers
pilgrimages
for
all
about
the
city
beyond
the
waters
or
beyond
the
hills
lie
holy
places
immemorially
old
kitzuki
founded
by
the
ancient

who
stout
the

upon
the
nethermost

and
made

kitzuki
the

claims
descent
from
the
goddess
of
the

and

famed
shrine
of
who
giveth
sight
to

lofty

is
approached
by

hundred
and

steps
of

of
the
eleven
faces
before
whose
altar
the
sacred

has
burned
without
ceasing
for

thousand
years
and
sada
where
the
sacred

lies
coiled
for
ever
on
the

of
the
gods
and
oba
with
its
temples
of
izanami
and

parents
of
gods
and
men
the
makers
of
the
world
and
yaegaki
whither
lovers
go
to
pray
for
unions
with
the
beloved
and
kaka
san
all
these
i
hope
to
see
but
of
all
places
assuredly
i
must
go
to
kaka
few
pilgrims
go
thither
by
sea
and
boatmen
are
forbidden
to
go
there
if
there
be
even
wind
enough
move
three
hairs
so
that
whosoever
wishes
to
visit
kaka
must
either
wait
for
a
period
of
dead
calm
very
rare
upon
the
coast
of
the
japanese
sea
or
journey
thereunto
by
land
and
by
land
the
way
is
difficult
and
wearisome
but
i
must
see
kaka
for
at
kaka
in
a
great
cavern
by
the
sea
there
is
a
famous
jizo
of
stone
and
each
night
it
is
said
the
ghosts
of
little
children
climb
to
the
high
cavern
and
pile
up
before
the
statue
small
heaps
of
pebbles
and
every
morning
in
the
soft
sand
there
may
be
seen
the
fresh
prints
of
tiny
naked
feet
the
feet
of
the
infant
ghosts
it
is
also
said
that
in
the
cavern
there
is
a
rock
out
of
which
comes
a
stream
of
milk
as
from
a
woman
breast
and
the
white
stream
flows
for
ever
and
the
phantom
children
drink
of
it
pilgrims
bring
with
them
gifts
of
small
straw
sandals
the
zori
that
children
wear
and
leave
them
before
the
cavern
that
the
feet
of
the
little
ghosts
may
not
be
wounded
by
the
sharp
rocks
and
the
pilgrim
treads
with
caution
lest
he
should
overturn
any
of
the
many
heaps
of
stones
for
if
this
be
done
the
children
cry
sec
the
city
proper
is
as
level
as
a
table
but
is
bounded
on
two
sides
by
low
demilunes
of
charming
hills
shadowed
with
evergreen
foliage
and
crowned
with
temples
or
shrines
there
are
thousand
souls
dwelling
in
ten
thousand
houses
forming
principal
and
many
smaller
streets
and
from
each
end
of
almost
every
street
beyond
the
hills
the
lake
or
the
eastern
a
mountain
summit
is
always
visible
green
blue
or
grey
according
to
distance
one
may
ride
walk
or
go
by
boat
to
any
quarter
of
the
town
for
it
is
not
only
divided
by
two
rivers
but
is
also
intersected
by
numbers
of
canals
crossed
by
queer
little
bridges
curved
like
a
bow
architecturally
despite
such
constructions
in
european
style
as
the
college
of
teachers
the
great
public
school
the
kencho
the
new
it
is
much
like
other
quaint
japanese
towns
the
structure
of
its
temples
taverns
shops
and
private
dwellings
is
the
same
as
in
other
cities
of
the
western
coast
but
doubtless
owing
to
the
fact
that
matsue
remained
a
feudal
stronghold
until
a
time
within
the
memory
of
thousands
still
living
those
feudal
distinctions
of
caste
so
sharply
drawn
in
ancient
times
are
yet
indicated
with
singular
exactness
by
the
varying
architecture
of
different
districts
the
city
can
be
definitely
divided
into
three
architectural
quarters
the
district
of
the
merchants
and
forming
the
heart
of
the
settlement
where
all
the
houses
are
two
stories
high
the
district
of
the
temples
including
nearly
the
whole
part
of
the
town
and
the
district
or
districts
of
the
shizoku
formerly
called
samurai
comprising
a
vast
number
of
large
roomy
dwellings
from
these
elegant
homes
in
feudal
days
could
be
summoned
at
a
moment
notice
five
thousand
men
with
their
armed
retainers
making
a
fighting
total
for
the
city
alone
of
probably
not
less
than
thirteen
thousand
warriors
more
than
of
all
the
city
buildings
were
then
samurai
homes
for
matsue
was
the
military
centre
of
the
most
ancient
province
of
japan
at
both
ends
of
the
town
which
curves
in
a
crescent
along
the
lake
shore
were
the
two
main
settlements
of
samurai
but
just
as
some
of
the
most
important
temples
are
situated
outside
of
the
temple
district
so
were
many
of
the
finest
homesteads
of
this
knightly
caste
situated
in
other
quarters
they
mustered
most
thickly
however
about
the
castle
which
stands
on
the
summit
of
its
citadel
hill
the
oshiroyama
solid
as
when
first
built
long
centuries
ago
a
vast
and
sinister
shape
all
rising
against
the
sky
from
a
cyclopean
foundation
of
stone
fantastically
grim
the
thing
is
and
grotesquely
complex
in
detail
looking
somewhat
like
a
huge
pagoda
of
which
the
second
third
and
fourth
stories
have
been
squeezed
down
and
telescoped
into
one
another
by
their
own
weight
crested
at
its
summit
like
a
feudal
helmet
with
two
colossal
fishes
of
bronze
lifting
their
curved
bodies
skyward
from
either
angle
of
the
roof
and
bristling
with
horned
gables
and
gargoyled
eaves
and
tilted
puzzles
of
tiled
roofing
at
every
story
the
creation
is
a
veritable
architectural
dragon
made
up
of
magnificent
monstrosities
a
dragon
moreover
full
of
eyes
set
at
all
conceivable
angles
above
below
and
on
every
side
from
under
the
black
scowl
of
the
loftiest
eaves
looking
east
and
south
the
whole
city
can
be
seen
at
a
single
glance
as
in
the
vision
of
a
soaring
hawk
and
from
the
northern
angle
the
view
plunges
down
three
hundred
feet
to
the
castle
road
where
walking
figures
of
men
appear
no
larger
than
flies
sec
the
grim
castle
has
its
legend
it
is
related
that
in
accordance
with
some
primitive
and
barbarous
custom
precisely
like
that
of
which
so
terrible
a
souvenir
has
been
preserved
for
us
in
the
most
pathetic
of
servian
ballads
foundation
of
skadra
a
maiden
of
matsue
was
interred
alive
under
the
walls
of
the
castle
at
the
time
of
its
erection
as
a
sacrifice
to
some
forgotten
gods
her
name
has
never
been
recorded
nothing
concerning
her
is
remembered
except
that
she
was
beautiful
and
very
fond
of
dancing
now
after
the
castle
had
been
built
it
is
said
that
a
law
had
to
be
passed
forbidding
that
any
girl
should
dance
in
the
streets
of
matsue
for
whenever
any
maiden
danced
the
hill
oshiroyama
would
shudder
and
the
great
castle
quiver
from
basement
to
summit
sec
one
may
still
sometimes
hear
in
the
streets
a
very
humorous
song
which
every
one
in
town
formerly
knew
by
heart
celebrating
the
seven
wonders
of
matsue
for
matsue
was
formerly
divided
into
seven
quarters
in
each
of
which
some
extraordinary
object
or
person
was
to
be
seen
it
is
now
divided
into
five
religious
districts
each
containing
a
temple
of
the
state
religion
people
living
within
those
districts
are
called
ujiko
and
the
temple
the
ujigami
or
of
the
tutelary
god
the
ujiko
must
support
the
ujigami
every
village
and
town
has
at
least
one
ujigami
there
is
probably
not
one
of
the
multitudinous
temples
of
matsue
which
has
not
some
marvellous
tradition
attached
to
it
each
of
the
districts
has
many
legends
and
i
think
that
each
of
the
streets
has
its
own
special
ghost
story
of
these
ghost
stories
i
cite
two
specimens
they
are
quite
representative
of
one
variety
of
japanese
near
to
the
temple
which
is
in
the
quarter
there
is
a
bridge
called
or
the
bridge
of
the
washing
of
peas
for
it
was
said
in
other
years
that
nightly
a
phantom
woman
sat
beneath
that
bridge
washing
phantom
peas
there
is
an
exquisite
japanese
of
colour
which
flower
is
named
and
there
is
a
song
about
that
flower
called
now
this
song
must
never
be
sung
near
the
because
for
some
strange
reason
which
seems
to
have
been
forgotten
the
ghosts
haunting
that
place
become
so
angry
upon
hearing
it
that
to
sing
it
there
is
to
expose
one
self
to
the
most
frightful
calamities
there
was
once
a
samurai
who
feared
nothing
who
one
night
went
to
that
bridge
and
loudly
sang
the
song
no
ghost
appearing
he
laughed
and
went
home
at
the
gate
of
his
house
he
met
a
beautiful
tall
woman
whom
he
had
never
seen
before
and
who
bowing
presented
him
with
a
lacquered
such
as
women
keep
their
letters
in
he
bowed
to
her
in
his
knightly
way
but
she
said
am
only
the
servant
this
is
my
mistress
gift
and
vanished
out
of
his
sight
opening
the
box
he
saw
the
bleeding
head
of
a
young
child
entering
his
house
he
found
upon
the
floor
of
the
the
dead
body
of
his
own
infant
son
with
the
head
torn
off
of
the
cemetery
which
is
in
the
street
called
nakabaramachi
this
story
is
told
in
nakabaramachi
there
is
an
ameya
or
little
shop
in
which
is
sold
the
syrup
made
of
malt
which
is
given
to
children
when
milk
can
not
be
obtained
for
them
every
night
at
a
late
hour
there
came
to
that
shop
a
very
pale
woman
all
in
white
to
buy
one
rin
worth
of
the
wondered
that
she
was
so
thin
and
pale
and
often
questioned
her
kindly
but
she
answered
nothing
at
last
one
night
he
followed
her
out
of
curiosity
she
went
to
the
cemetery
and
he
became
afraid
and
returned
the
next
night
the
woman
came
again
but
bought
no
and
only
beckoned
to
the
man
to
go
with
her
he
followed
her
with
friends
into
the
cemetery
she
walked
to
a
certain
tomb
and
there
disappeared
and
they
heard
under
the
ground
the
crying
of
a
child
opening
the
tomb
they
saw
within
it
the
corpse
of
the
woman
who
nightly
visited
the
ameya
with
a
living
infant
laughing
to
see
the
lantern
light
and
beside
the
infant
a
little
cup
of
for
the
mother
had
been
prematurely
buried
the
child
was
born
in
the
tomb
and
the
ghost
of
the
mother
had
thus
provided
for
it
love
being
stronger
than
death
sec
over
the
or
bridge
of
tenjin
and
through
small
streets
and
narrow
of
densely
populated
districts
and
past
many
a
tenantless
and
mouldering
feudal
homestead
i
make
my
way
to
the
extreme
end
of
the
city
to
watch
the
sunset
from
a
little
sobaya
facing
the
lake
for
to
see
the
sun
sink
from
this
sobaya
is
one
of
the
delights
of
matsue
there
are
no
such
sunsets
in
japan
as
in
the
tropics
the
light
is
gentle
as
a
light
of
dreams
there
are
no
furies
of
colour
there
are
no
chromatic
violences
in
nature
in
this
orient
all
in
sea
or
sky
is
tint
rather
than
colour
and
tint
i
think
that
the
exquisite
taste
of
the
race
in
the
matter
of
colours
and
of
tints
as
exemplified
in
the
dyes
of
their
wonderful
textures
is
largely
attributable
to
the
sober
and
delicate
beauty
of
nature
tones
in
this
world
where
nothing
is
garish
before
me
the
fair
vast
lake
sleeps
softly
luminous
with
chains
of
blue
volcanic
hills
shaped
like
a
sierra
on
my
right
at
its
eastern
end
the
most
ancient
quarter
of
the
city
spreads
its
roofs
of
tile
the
houses
crowd
thickly
down
to
the
shore
to
dip
their
wooden
feet
into
the
flood
with
a
glass
i
can
see
my
own
windows
and
the
of
the
roofs
beyond
and
above
all
else
the
green
citadel
with
its
grim
castle
grotesquely
peaked
the
sun
begins
to
set
and
exquisite
astonishments
of
tinting
appear
in
water
and
sky
dead
rich
purples
cloud
broadly
behind
and
above
the
indigo
blackness
of
the
serrated
hills
mist
purples
fading
upward
smokily
into
faint
vermilions
and
dim
gold
which
again
melt
up
through
ghostliest
greens
into
the
blue
the
deeper
waters
of
the
lake
far
away
take
a
tender
violet
indescribable
and
the
silhouette
of
the
island
seems
to
float
in
that
sea
of
soft
sweet
colour
but
the
shallower
and
nearer
is
cut
from
the
deeper
water
by
the
current
as
sharply
as
by
a
line
drawn
and
all
the
surface
on
this
side
of
that
line
is
a
shimmering
bronze
old
rich
ruddy
all
the
fainter
colours
change
every
five
minutes
wondrously
change
and
shift
like
tones
and
shades
of
fine
sec
often
in
the
streets
at
night
especially
on
the
nights
of
sacred
festivals
matsuri
one
attention
will
be
attracted
to
some
small
booth
by
the
spectacle
of
an
admiring
and
perfectly
silent
crowd
pressing
before
it
as
soon
as
one
can
get
a
chance
to
look
one
finds
there
is
nothing
to
look
at
but
a
few
vases
containing
sprays
of
flowers
or
perhaps
some
light
gracious
branches
freshly
cut
from
a
blossoming
tree
it
is
simply
a
little
or
more
correctly
a
free
exhibition
of
master
skill
in
the
arrangement
of
flowers
for
the
japanese
do
not
brutally
chop
off
to
work
them
up
into
meaningless
masses
of
colour
as
we
barbarians
do
they
love
nature
too
well
for
that
they
know
how
much
the
natural
charm
of
the
flower
depends
upon
its
setting
and
mounting
its
relation
to
leaf
and
stem
and
they
select
a
single
graceful
branch
or
spray
just
as
nature
made
it
at
first
you
will
not
as
a
western
stranger
comprehend
such
an
exhibition
at
all
you
are
yet
a
savage
in
such
matters
compared
with
the
commonest
coolies
about
you
but
even
while
you
are
still
wondering
at
popular
interest
in
this
simple
little
show
the
charm
of
it
will
begin
to
grow
upon
you
will
become
a
revelation
to
you
and
despite
your
occidental
idea
of
you
will
feel
humbled
by
the
discovery
that
all
flower
displays
you
have
ever
seen
abroad
were
only
monstrosities
in
comparison
with
the
natural
beauty
of
those
few
simple
sprays
you
will
also
observe
how
much
the
white
or
pale
blue
screen
behind
the
flowers
enhances
the
effect
by
lamp
or
lantern
light
for
the
screen
has
been
arranged
with
the
special
purpose
of
showing
the
exquisiteness
of
plant
shadows
and
the
sharp
silhouettes
of
sprays
and
blossoms
cast
thereon
are
beautiful
beyond
the
imagining
of
any
western
decorative
artist
sec
it
is
still
the
season
of
mists
in
this
land
whose
most
ancient
name
signifies
the
place
of
the
issuing
of
clouds
with
the
passing
of
twilight
a
faint
ghostly
brume
rises
over
lake
and
landscape
spectrally
veiling
surfaces
slowly
obliterating
distances
as
i
lean
over
the
parapet
of
the
on
my
homeward
way
to
take
one
last
look
eastward
i
find
that
the
mountains
have
already
been
effaced
before
me
there
is
only
a
shadowy
flood
far
vanishing
into
vagueness
without
a
horizon
the
phantom
of
a
sea
and
i
become
suddenly
aware
that
little
white
things
are
fluttering
slowly
down
into
it
from
the
fingers
of
a
woman
standing
upon
the
bridge
beside
me
and
murmuring
something
in
a
low
sweet
voice
she
is
praying
for
her
dead
child
each
of
those
little
papers
she
is
dropping
into
the
current
bears
a
tiny
picture
of
jizo
and
perhaps
a
little
inscription
for
when
a
child
dies
the
mother
buys
a
small
woodcut
hanko
of
jizo
and
with
it
prints
the
image
of
the
divinity
upon
one
hundred
little
papers
and
she
sometimes
also
writes
upon
the
papers
words
signifying
the
sake
of
inscribing
never
the
living
but
the
kaimyo
or
only
which
the
buddhist
priest
has
given
to
the
dead
and
which
is
written
also
upon
the
little
commemorative
tablet
kept
within
the
buddhist
household
shrine
or
butsuma
then
upon
a
fixed
day
most
commonly
the
day
after
the
burial
she
goes
to
some
place
of
running
water
and
drops
the
little
papers
therein
one
by
one
repeating
as
each
slips
through
her
fingers
the
holy
invocation
jizo
dai
bosatsu
doubtless
this
pious
little
woman
praying
beside
me
in
the
dusk
is
very
poor
were
she
not
she
would
hire
a
boat
and
scatter
her
tiny
papers
far
away
upon
the
bosom
of
the
lake
it
is
now
only
after
dark
that
this
may
be
done
for
the
police
i
know
not
why
have
been
instructed
to
prevent
the
pretty
rite
just
as
in
the
open
ports
they
have
been
instructed
to
prohibit
the
launching
of
the
little
straw
boats
of
the
dead
the
shoryobune
but
why
should
the
papers
be
cast
into
running
water
a
good
old
tendai
priest
tells
me
that
originally
the
rite
was
only
for
the
souls
of
the
drowned
but
now
these
gentle
hearts
believe
that
all
waters
flow
downward
to
the
and
through
the
where
jizo
is
sec
at
home
again
i
slide
open
once
more
my
little
paper
window
and
look
out
upon
the
night
i
see
the
paper
lanterns
flitting
over
the
bridge
like
a
long
shimmering
of
fireflies
i
see
the
spectres
of
a
hundred
lights
trembling
upon
the
black
flood
i
see
the
broad
shoji
of
dwellings
beyond
the
river
suffused
with
the
soft
yellow
radiance
of
invisible
lamps
and
upon
those
lighted
spaces
i
can
discern
slender
moving
shadows
silhouettes
of
graceful

devoutly
do

pray
that

never
become

hear
the

its
soft

thunder
across
the

of
the
race
by
whom
izanagi
and
izanami
are
yet
worshiped
so
is
kitzuki
of
izumo
especially
the
city
of
the
gods
and
its
immemorial
temple
the
earliest
home
of
the
ancient
faith
the
great
religion
of
shinto
now
to
visit
kitzuki
has
been
my
most
earnest
ambition
since
i
learned
the
legends
of
the
kojiki
concerning
it
and
this
ambition
has
been
stimulated
by
the
discovery
that
very
few
europeans
have
visited
kitzuki
and
that
none
have
been
admitted
into
the
great
temple
itself
some
indeed
were
not
allowed
even
to
approach
the
temple
court
but
i
trust
that
i
shall
be
somewhat
more
fortunate
for
i
have
a
letter
of
introduction
from
my
dear
friend
nishida
sentaro
who
is
also
a
personal
friend
of
the
high
pontiff
of
kitzuki
i
am
thus
assured
that
even
should
i
not
be
permitted
to
enter
the
temple
a
privilege
accorded
to
but
few
among
the
japanese
themselves
i
shall
at
least
have
the
honour
of
an
interview
with
the
guji
or
spiritual
governor
of
kitzuki
senke
takanori
whose
princely
family
trace
back
their
descent
to
the
goddess
of
the
sun
sec
i
leave
matsue
for
kitzuki
early
in
the
afternoon
of
a
beautiful
september
day
taking
passage
upon
a
tiny
steamer
in
which
everything
from
engines
to
awnings
is
lilliputian
in
the
cabin
one
must
kneel
under
the
awnings
one
can
not
possibly
stand
upright
but
the
miniature
craft
is
neat
and
pretty
as
a
toy
model
and
moves
with
surprising
swiftness
and
steadiness
a
handsome
naked
boy
is
busy
serving
the
passengers
with
cups
of
tea
and
with
cakes
and
setting
little
charcoal
furnaces
before
those
who
desire
to
smoke
for
all
of
which
a
payment
of
about
of
a
cent
is
expected
i
escape
from
the
awnings
to
climb
upon
the
cabin
roof
for
a
view
and
the
view
is
indescribably
lovely
over
the
lucent
level
of
the
lake
we
are
steaming
toward
a
heaping
of
beautiful
shapes
coloured
with
that
strangely
delicate
blue
which
tints
all
distances
in
the
japanese
atmosphere
shapes
of
peaks
and
headlands
looming
up
from
the
lake
verge
against
a
horizon
they
show
no
details
whatever
silhouettes
only
they
are
masses
of
absolutely
pure
colour
to
left
and
right
framing
in
the
shinjiko
are
superb
green
surgings
of
wooded
hills
great
is
the
loftiest
mountain
before
us
behind
us
the
city
has
vanished
but
proudly
towering
beyond
looms
daisen
enormous
ghostly
blue
and
ghostly
white
lifting
the
cusps
of
its
dead
crater
into
the
region
of
eternal
snow
over
all
arches
a
sky
of
colour
faint
as
a
dream
there
seems
to
be
a
sense
of
divine
magic
in
the
very
atmosphere
through
all
the
luminous
day
brooding
over
the
vapoury
land
over
the
ghostly
blue
of
the
flood
a
sense
of
shinto
with
my
fancy
full
of
the
legends
of
the
kojiki
the
rhythmic
chant
of
the
engines
comes
to
my
ears
as
the
rhythm
of
a
shinto
ritual
mingled
with
the
names
of
gods
sec
the
great
range
on
the
right
grows
loftier
as
we
steam
on
and
its
hills
always
slowly
advancing
toward
us
begin
to
reveal
all
the
rich
details
of
their
foliage
and
lo
on
the
tip
of
one
grand
peak
is
visible
against
the
pure
sky
the
roof
of
a
great
buddhist
temple
that
is
the
temple
of
ichibata
upon
the
mountain
the
temple
of
the
physician
of
souls
but
at
ichibata
he
reveals
himself
more
specially
as
the
healer
of
bodies
the
buddha
who
giveth
sight
unto
the
blind
it
is
believed
that
whosoever
has
an
affection
of
the
eyes
will
be
made
well
by
praying
earnestly
at
that
great
shrine
and
thither
from
many
distant
provinces
do
afflicted
thousands
make
pilgrimage
ascending
the
long
weary
mountain
path
and
the
six
hundred
and
forty
steps
of
stone
leading
to
the
windy
temple
court
upon
the
summit
whence
may
be
seen
one
of
the
loveliest
landscapes
in
japan
there
the
pilgrims
wash
their
eyes
with
the
water
of
the
sacred
spring
and
kneel
before
the
shrine
and
murmur
the
holy
formula
of
ichibata
words
of
which
the
meaning
has
long
been
forgotten
like
that
of
many
a
buddhist
invocation
sanscrit
words
transliterated
into
chinese
and
thence
into
japanese
which
are
understood
by
learned
priests
alone
yet
are
known
by
heart
throughout
the
land
and
uttered
with
the
utmost
fervour
of
devotion
i
descend
from
the
cabin
roof
and
squat
upon
the
deck
under
the
awnings
to
have
a
smoke
with
akira
and
i
ask
many
buddhas
are
there
o
akira
is
the
number
of
the
enlightened
known
the
buddhas
are
makes
answer
akira
there
is
truly
but
one
buddha
the
many
are
forms
only
each
of
us
contains
a
future
buddha
alike
we
all
are
except
in
that
we
are
more
or
less
unconscious
of
the
truth
but
the
vulgar
may
not
understand
these
things
and
so
seek
refuge
in
symbols
and
in
forms
the
kami
the
deities
of
shinto
shinto
i
know
little
but
there
are
eight
hundred
myriads
of
kami
in
the
plain
of
high
heaven
so
says
the
ancient
book
of
these
three
thousand
one
hundred
and
thirty
and
two
dwell
in
the
various
provinces
of
the
land
being
enshrined
in
two
thousand
eight
hundred
and
temples
and
the
tenth
month
of
our
year
is
called
the
because
in
that
month
all
the
deities
leave
their
temples
to
assemble
in
the
province
of
izumo
at
the
great
temple
of
kitzuki
and
for
the
same
reason
that
month
is
called
in
izumo
and
only
in
izumo
the
but
educated
persons
sometimes
call
it
the
using
chinese
words
then
it
is
believed
the
serpents
come
from
the
sea
to
the
land
and
coil
upon
the
sambo
which
is
the
table
of
the
gods
for
the
serpents
announce
the
coming
and
the
sends
messengers
to
the
temples
of
izanagi
and
izanami
the
parents
of
gods
and
men
akira
many
millions
of
kami
there
must
be
of
whom
i
shall
always
remain
ignorant
for
there
is
a
limit
to
the
power
of
memory
but
tell
me
something
of
the
gods
whose
names
are
most
seldom
uttered
the
deities
of
strange
places
and
of
strange
things
the
most
extraordinary
gods
can
not
learn
much
about
them
from
me
replies
akira
will
have
to
ask
others
more
learned
than
i
but
there
are
gods
with
whom
it
is
not
desirable
to
become
acquainted
such
are
the
god
of
poverty
and
the
god
of
hunger
and
the
god
of
penuriousness
and
the
god
of
hindrances
and
obstacles
these
are
of
dark
colour
like
the
clouds
of
gloomy
days
and
their
faces
are
like
the
faces
of
gaki
the
god
of
hindrances
and
obstacles
o
akira
i
have
had
more
than
a
passing
acquaintance
tell
me
of
the
others
know
little
about
any
of
them
answers
akira
bimbogami
it
is
said
there
are
two
gods
who
always
go
together
who
is
the
god
of
luck
and
bimbogami
who
is
the
god
of
poverty
the
first
is
white
and
the
second
is
black
the
last
i
venture
to
interrupt
only
the
shadow
of
the
first
is
the
and
bimbogami
the
shadow
and
i
have
observed
in
wandering
about
this
world
that
wherever
the
one
goeth
eternally
followeth
after
him
the
other
akira
refuses
his
assent
to
this
interpretation
and
resumes
bimbogami
once
begins
to
follow
anyone
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
be
free
from
him
again
in
the
village
of
umitsu
which
is
in
the
province
of
omi
and
not
far
from
kyoto
there
once
lived
a
buddhist
priest
who
during
many
years
was
grievously
tormented
by
bimbogami
he
tried
oftentimes
without
avail
to
drive
him
away
then
he
strove
to
deceive
him
by
proclaiming
aloud
to
all
the
people
that
he
was
going
to
kyoto
but
instead
of
going
to
kyoto
he
went
to
tsuruga
in
the
province
of
echizen
and
when
he
reached
the
inn
at
tsuruga
there
came
forth
to
meet
him
a
boy
lean
and
wan
like
a
gaki
the
boy
said
to
him
i
have
been
waiting
for
you
and
the
boy
was
bimbogami
was
another
priest
who
for
sixty
years
had
tried
in
vain
to
get
rid
of
bimbogami
and
who
resolved
at
last
to
go
to
a
distant
province
on
the
night
after
he
had
formed
this
resolve
he
had
a
strange
dream
in
which
he
saw
a
very
much
emaciated
boy
naked
and
dirty
weaving
sandals
of
straw
waraji
such
as
pilgrims
and
runners
wear
and
he
made
so
many
that
the
priest
wondered
and
asked
him
for
what
purpose
are
you
making
so
many
sandals
and
the
boy
answered
i
am
going
to
travel
with
you
i
am
bimbogami
is
there
no
way
akira
by
which
bimbogami
may
be
driven
away
is
written
replies
akira
the
book
called
that
the
aged
enjobo
a
priest
dwelling
in
the
province
of
owari
was
able
to
get
rid
of
bimbogami
by
means
of
a
charm
on
the
last
day
of
the
last
month
of
the
year
he
and
his
disciples
and
other
priests
of
the
shingon
sect
took
branches
of
and
recited
a
formula
and
then
with
the
branches
imitated
the
action
of
driving
a
person
out
of
the
temple
after
which
they
shut
all
the
gates
and
recited
other
formulas
the
same
night
enjobo
dreamed
of
a
skeleton
priest
in
a
broken
temple
weeping
alone
and
the
skeleton
priest
said
to
him
after
i
had
been
with
you
for
so
many
years
how
could
you
drive
me
away
but
always
thereafter
until
the
day
of
his
death
enjobo
lived
in
prosperity
sec
for
an
hour
and
a
half
the
ranges
to
left
and
right
alternately
recede
and
approach
beautiful
blue
shapes
glide
toward
us
change
to
green
and
then
slowly
drifting
behind
us
are
all
blue
again
but
the
far
mountains
immediately
before
us
immovable
unchanging
always
remain
ghosts
suddenly
the
little
steamer
turns
straight
into
the
land
a
land
so
low
that
it
came
into
sight
quite
unexpectedly
and
we
puff
up
a
narrow
stream
between
to
a
queer
quaint
pretty
village
on
the
canal
bank
shobara
here
i
must
hire
jinricksha
to
take
us
to
kitzuki
there
is
not
time
to
see
much
of
shobara
if
i
hope
to
reach
kitzuki
before
bedtime
and
i
have
only
a
flying
vision
of
one
long
wide
street
so
picturesque
that
i
wish
i
could
pass
a
day
in
it
as
our
kuruma
rush
through
the
little
town
into
the
open
country
into
a
vast
plain
covered
with
the
road
itself
is
only
a
broad
dike
barely
wide
enough
for
two
jinricksha
to
pass
each
other
upon
it
on
each
side
the
superb
plain
is
bounded
by
a
mountain
range
shutting
off
the
white
horizon
there
is
a
vast
silence
an
immense
sense
of
dreamy
peace
and
a
glorious
soft
vapoury
light
over
everything
as
we
roll
into
the
country
of
hyasugi
to
kaminawoe
the
jagged
range
on
the
left
is
all
sharply
green
with
the
giant
overtopping
all
and
its
peaks
bear
the
names
of
gods
much
more
remote
upon
our
right
enormous
tower
the
shapes
of
the
or
northern
range
filing
away
in
tremendous
procession
toward
the
sunset
fading
more
and
more
as
they
stretch
west
to
vanish
suddenly
at
last
after
the
ghostliest
conceivable
manner
into
the
uttermost
day
all
this
is
beautiful
yet
there
is
no
change
while
hours
pass
always
the
way
winds
on
through
miles
of
with
shafts
which
are
arrows
of
prayer
always
the
voice
of
frogs
a
sound
as
of
infinite
bubbling
always
the
green
range
on
the
left
the
purple
on
the
right
fading
westward
into
a
tall
file
of
tinted
spectres
which
always
melt
into
nothing
at
last
as
if
they
were
made
of
air
the
monotony
of
the
scene
is
broken
only
by
our
occasional
passing
through
some
pretty
japanese
village
or
by
the
appearance
of
a
curious
statue
or
monument
at
an
angle
of
the
path
a
roadside
jizo
or
the
grave
of
a
wrestler
such
as
may
be
seen
on
the
bank
of
the
hiagawa
a
huge
slab
of
granite
sculptured
with
the
words
matsu
kikusuki
but
after
reaching
kandogori
and
passing
over
a
broad
but
shallow
river
a
fresh
detail
appears
in
the
landscape
above
the
mountain
chain
on
our
left
looms
a
colossal
blue
silhouette
almost
recognisable
by
its
outline
as
a
once
mighty
volcano
it
is
now
known
by
various
names
but
it
was
called
in
ancient
times
and
it
has
its
shinto
legend
it
is
said
that
in
the
beginning
the
god
of
izumo
gazing
over
the
land
said
new
land
of
izumo
is
a
land
of
but
small
extent
so
i
will
make
it
a
larger
land
by
adding
unto
it
having
so
said
he
looked
about
him
over
to
korea
and
there
he
saw
land
which
was
good
for
the
purpose
with
a
great
rope
he
dragged
therefrom
four
islands
and
added
the
land
of
them
to
izumo
the
first
island
was
called
and
it
formed
the
land
where
kitzuki
now
is
the
second
island
was
called
and
is
at
this
day
the
site
of
the
holy
temple
where
all
the
gods
do
yearly
hold
their
second
assembly
after
having
first
gathered
together
at
kitzuki
the
third
island
was
called
in
its
new
place
which
now
forms
the
fourth
island
became
that
place
where
stands
the
temple
of
the
great
god
at
whose
shrine
are
delivered
unto
the
faithful
the
charms
which
protect
the
now
in
drawing
these
islands
across
the
sea
into
their
several
places
the
god
looped
his
rope
over
the
mighty
mountain
of
daisen
and
over
the
mountain
and
they
both
bear
the
marks
of
that
wondrous
rope
even
unto
this
day
as
for
the
rope
itself
part
of
it
was
changed
into
the
long
island
of
ancient
times
called
and
a
part
into
the
long
beach
of
sono
after
we
pass
the
the
road
narrows
and
becomes
rougher
and
rougher
but
always
draws
nearer
to
the
kitayama
range
toward
sundown
we
have
come
close
enough
to
the
great
hills
to
discern
the
details
of
their
foliage
the
path
begins
to
rise
we
ascend
slowly
through
the
gathering
dusk
at
last
there
appears
before
us
a
great
multitude
of
twinkling
lights
we
have
reached
kitzuki
the
holy
city
sec
over
a
long
bridge
and
under
a
tall
torii
we
roll
into
streets
like
enoshima
kitzuki
has
a
torii
for
its
city
gate
but
the
torii
is
not
of
bronze
then
a
flying
vision
of
open
and
lines
of
luminous
shoji
under
eaves
and
buddhist
gateways
guarded
by
lions
of
stone
and
long
low
walls
of
temple
courts
overtopped
by
garden
shrubbery
and
shinto
shrines
prefaced
by
other
tall
torii
but
no
sign
of
the
great
temple
itself
it
lies
toward
the
rear
of
the
city
proper
at
the
foot
of
the
wooded
mountains
and
we
are
too
tired
and
hungry
to
visit
it
now
so
we
halt
before
a
spacious
and
inn
the
best
indeed
in
kitzuki
and
rest
ourselves
and
eat
and
drink
sake
out
of
exquisite
little
porcelain
cups
the
gift
of
some
pretty
to
the
hotel
thereafter
as
it
has
become
much
too
late
to
visit
the
guji
i
send
to
his
residence
by
a
messenger
my
letter
of
introduction
with
an
humble
request
in
akira
handwriting
that
i
may
be
allowed
to
present
myself
at
the
house
before
noon
the
next
day
then
the
landlord
of
the
hotel
who
seems
to
be
a
very
kindly
person
comes
to
us
with
lighted
paper
lanterns
and
invites
us
to
accompany
him
to
the
most
of
the
houses
have
already
closed
their
wooden
sliding
doors
for
the
night
so
that
the
streets
are
dark
and
the
lanterns
of
our
landlord
indispensable
for
there
is
no
moon
and
the
night
is
starless
we
walk
along
the
main
street
for
a
distance
of
about
six
squares
and
then
making
a
turn
find
ourselves
before
a
superb
bronze
torii
the
gateway
to
the
great
temple
avenue
sec
effacing
colours
and
obliterating
distances
night
always
magnifies
by
suggestion
the
aspect
of
large
spaces
and
the
effect
of
large
objects
viewed
by
the
vague
light
of
paper
lanterns
the
approach
to
the
great
shrine
is
an
imposing
surprise
such
a
surprise
that
i
feel
regret
at
the
mere
thought
of
having
to
see
it
by
disenchanting
day
a
superb
avenue
lined
with
colossal
trees
and
ranging
away
out
of
sight
under
a
succession
of
giant
torii
from
which
are
suspended
enormous
shimenawa
well
worthy
the
grasp
of
that
deity
whose
symbols
they
are
but
more
than
by
the
torii
and
their
festooned
symbols
the
dim
majesty
of
the
huge
avenue
is
enhanced
by
the
prodigious
trees
many
perhaps
thousands
of
years
old
gnarled
pines
whose
shaggy
summits
are
lost
in
darkness
some
of
the
mighty
trunks
are
surrounded
with
a
rope
of
straw
these
trees
are
sacred
the
vast
roots
in
every
direction
look
in
the
like
a
writhing
and
crawling
of
dragons
the
avenue
is
certainly
not
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
length
it
crosses
two
bridges
and
passes
between
two
sacred
groves
all
the
broad
lands
on
either
side
of
it
belong
to
the
temple
formerly
no
foreigner
was
permitted
to
pass
beyond
the
middle
torii
the
avenue
terminates
at
a
lofty
wall
pierced
by
a
gateway
resembling
the
gateways
of
buddhist
temple
courts
but
very
massive
this
is
the
entrance
to
the
outer
court
the
ponderous
doors
are
still
open
and
many
shadowy
figures
are
passing
in
or
out
within
the
court
all
is
darkness
against
which
pale
yellow
lights
are
gliding
to
and
fro
like
a
multitude
of
enormous
fireflies
the
lanterns
of
pilgrims
i
can
distinguish
only
the
looming
of
immense
buildings
to
left
and
right
constructed
with
colossal
timbers
our
guide
traverses
a
very
large
court
passes
into
a
second
and
halts
before
an
imposing
structure
whose
doors
are
still
open
above
them
by
the
lantern
glow
i
can
see
a
marvellous
frieze
of
dragons
and
water
carved
in
some
rich
wood
by
the
hand
of
a
master
within
i
can
see
the
symbols
of
shinto
in
a
side
shrine
on
the
left
and
directly
before
us
the
lanterns
reveal
a
surface
of
matted
floor
vaster
than
anything
i
had
expected
to
find
therefrom
i
can
divine
the
scale
of
the
edifice
which
i
suppose
to
be
the
temple
but
the
landlord
tells
us
this
is
not
the
temple
but
only
the
haiden
or
hall
of
prayer
before
which
the
people
make
their
orisons
by
day
through
the
open
doors
the
temple
can
be
seen
but
we
can
not
see
it
and
but
few
visitors
are
permitted
to
go
in
people
do
not
enter
even
the
court
of
the
great
shrine
for
the
most
part
interprets
akira
pray
before
it
at
a
distance
listen
all
about
me
in
the
shadow
i
hear
a
sound
like
the
plashing
and
dashing
of
water
the
clapping
of
many
hands
in
shinto
prayer
this
is
nothing
says
the
landlord
are
but
few
here
now
wait
until
which
is
a
festival
day
as
we
wend
our
way
back
along
the
great
avenue
under
the
torii
and
the
giant
trees
akira
interprets
for
me
what
our
landlord
tells
him
about
the
sacred
serpent
little
serpent
he
says
called
by
the
people
the
august
for
it
is
sent
by
the
to
announce
the
coming
of
the
gods
the
sea
darkens
and
rises
and
roars
before
the
coming
of
sama
we
call
it
because
it
is
the
messenger
of
the
palace
of
the
dragons
but
it
is
also
called
hakuja
or
the
serpent
the
little
serpent
come
to
the
temple
of
its
own
accord
no
it
is
caught
by
the
fishermen
and
only
one
can
be
caught
in
a
year
because
only
one
is
sent
and
whoever
catches
it
and
brings
it
either
to
the
or
to
the
temple
sadajinja
where
the
gods
hold
their
second
assembly
during
the
receives
one
hyo
of
rice
in
recompense
it
costs
much
labour
and
time
to
catch
a
serpent
but
whoever
captures
one
is
sure
to
become
rich
in
after
time
are
many
deities
enshrined
at
kitzuki
are
there
not
i
ask
but
the
great
deity
of
kitzuki
is
whom
the
people
more
commonly
call
daikoku
here
also
is
worshipped
his
son
whom
many
call
ebisu
these
deities
are
usually
pictured
together
daikoku
seated
upon
bales
of
rice
holding
the
red
sun
against
his
breast
with
one
hand
and
in
the
other
grasping
the
magical
mallet
of
which
a
single
stroke
gives
wealth
and
ebisu
bearing
a
and
holding
under
his
arm
a
great
these
gods
are
always
represented
with
smiling
faces
and
both
have
great
ears
which
are
the
sign
of
wealth
and
fortune
sec
a
little
wearied
by
the
day
journeying
i
get
to
bed
early
and
sleep
as
dreamlessly
as
a
plant
until
i
am
awakened
about
daylight
by
a
heavy
regular
bumping
sound
shaking
the
wooden
pillow
on
which
my
ear
rests
the
sound
of
the
katsu
of
the
kometsuki
beginning
his
eternal
labour
of
then
the
pretty
musume
of
the
inn
opens
the
chamber
to
the
fresh
mountain
air
and
the
early
sun
rolls
back
all
the
wooden
shutters
into
their
casings
behind
the
gallery
takes
down
the
brown
mosquito
net
brings
a
hibachi
with
freshly
kindled
charcoal
for
my
morning
smoke
and
trips
away
to
get
our
breakfast
early
as
it
is
when
she
returns
she
brings
word
that
a
messenger
has
already
arrived
from
the
guji
senke
takanori
high
descendant
of
the
goddess
of
the
sun
the
messenger
is
a
dignified
young
shinto
priest
clad
in
the
ordinary
japanese
full
costume
but
wearing
also
a
superb
pair
of
blue
silken
hakama
or
japanese
ceremonial
trousers
widening
picturesquely
towards
the
feet
he
accepts
my
invitation
to
a
cup
of
tea
and
informs
me
that
his
august
master
is
waiting
for
us
at
the
temple
this
is
delightful
news
but
we
can
not
go
at
once
akira
attire
is
pronounced
by
the
messenger
to
be
defective
akira
must
don
fresh
white
tabi
and
put
on
hakama
before
going
into
the
august
presence
no
one
may
enter
thereinto
without
hakama
happily
akira
is
able
to
borrow
a
pair
of
hakama
from
the
landlord
and
after
having
arranged
ourselves
as
neatly
as
we
can
we
take
our
way
to
the
temple
guided
by
the
messenger
sec
i
am
agreeably
surprised
to
find
as
we
pass
again
under
a
magnificent
bronze
torii
which
i
admired
the
night
before
that
the
approaches
to
the
temple
lose
very
little
of
their
imposing
character
when
seen
for
the
first
time
by
sunlight
the
majesty
of
the
trees
remains
astonishing
the
vista
of
the
avenue
is
grand
and
the
vast
spaces
of
groves
and
grounds
to
right
and
left
are
even
more
impressive
than
i
had
imagined
multitudes
of
pilgrims
are
going
and
coming
but
the
whole
population
of
a
province
might
move
along
such
an
avenue
without
jostling
before
the
gate
of
the
first
court
a
shinto
priest
in
full
sacerdotal
costume
waits
to
receive
us
an
elderly
man
with
a
pleasant
kindly
face
the
messenger
commits
us
to
his
charge
and
vanishes
through
the
gateway
while
the
elderly
priest
whose
name
is
sasa
leads
the
way
already
i
can
hear
a
heavy
sound
as
of
surf
within
the
temple
court
and
as
we
advance
the
sound
becomes
sharper
and
recognisable
a
volleying
of
handclaps
and
passing
the
great
gate
i
see
thousands
of
pilgrims
before
the
haiden
the
same
huge
structure
which
i
visited
last
night
none
enter
there
all
stand
before
the
doorway
and
cast
their
offerings
into
the
placed
before
the
threshold
many
making
contribution
of
small
coin
the
very
poorest
throwing
only
a
handful
of
rice
into
the
box
then
they
clap
their
hands
and
bow
their
heads
before
the
threshold
and
reverently
gaze
through
the
hall
of
prayer
at
the
loftier
edifice
the
holy
of
holies
beyond
it
each
pilgrim
remains
but
a
little
while
and
claps
his
hands
but
four
times
yet
so
many
are
coming
and
going
that
the
sound
of
the
clapping
is
like
the
sound
of
a
cataract
passing
by
the
multitude
of
worshippers
to
the
other
side
of
the
haiden
we
find
ourselves
at
the
foot
of
a
broad
flight
of
steps
leading
to
the
great
sanctuary
steps
which
i
am
told
no
european
before
me
was
ever
permitted
to
approach
on
the
lower
steps
the
priests
of
the
temple
in
full
ceremonial
costume
are
waiting
to
receive
us
tall
men
they
are
robed
in
violet
and
purple
silks
shot
through
with
in
gold
their
lofty
fantastic
their
voluminous
and
beautiful
costume
and
the
solemn
immobility
of
their
hierophantic
attitudes
make
them
at
first
sight
seem
marvellous
statues
only
somehow
or
other
there
comes
suddenly
back
to
me
the
memory
of
a
strange
french
print
i
used
to
wonder
at
when
a
child
representing
a
group
of
assyrian
astrologers
only
their
eyes
move
as
we
approach
but
as
i
reach
the
steps
all
simultaneously
salute
me
with
a
most
gracious
bow
for
i
am
the
first
foreign
pilgrim
to
be
honoured
by
the
privilege
of
an
interview
in
the
holy
shrine
itself
with
the
princely
hierophant
their
master
descendant
of
the
goddess
of
the
sun
he
who
is
still
called
by
myriads
of
humble
worshippers
in
the
remoter
districts
of
this
ancient
province
ikigami
living
deity
then
all
become
absolutely
statuesque
again
i
remove
my
shoes
and
am
about
to
ascend
the
steps
when
the
tall
priest
who
first
received
us
before
the
outer
gate
indicates
by
a
single
significant
gesture
that
religion
and
ancient
custom
require
me
before
ascending
to
the
shrine
of
the
god
to
perform
the
ceremonial
ablution
i
hold
out
my
hands
the
priest
pours
the
pure
water
over
them
thrice
from
a
vessel
of
bamboo
with
a
long
handle
and
then
gives
me
a
little
blue
towel
to
wipe
them
upon
a
votive
towel
with
mysterious
white
characters
upon
it
then
we
all
ascend
i
feeling
very
much
like
a
clumsy
barbarian
in
my
ungraceful
foreign
garb
pausing
at
the
head
of
the
steps
the
priest
inquires
my
rank
in
society
for
at
kitzuki
hierarchy
and
hierarchical
forms
are
maintained
with
a
rigidity
as
precise
as
in
the
period
of
the
gods
and
there
are
special
forms
and
regulations
for
the
reception
of
visitors
of
every
social
grade
i
do
not
know
what
flattering
statements
akira
may
have
made
about
me
to
the
good
priest
but
the
result
is
that
i
can
rank
only
as
a
common
person
which
veracious
fact
doubtless
saves
me
from
some
formalities
which
would
have
proved
embarrassing
all
ignorant
as
i
still
am
of
that
finer
and
more
complex
etiquette
in
which
the
japanese
are
the
world
masters
sec
the
priest
leads
the
way
into
a
vast
and
lofty
apartment
opening
for
its
entire
length
upon
the
broad
gallery
to
which
the
stairway
ascends
i
have
barely
time
to
notice
while
following
him
that
the
chamber
contains
three
immense
shrines
forming
alcoves
on
two
sides
of
it
ofthese
two
are
veiled
by
white
curtains
reaching
from
ceiling
to
matting
curtains
decorated
with
perpendicular
rows
of
black
disks
about
four
inches
in
diameter
each
disk
having
in
its
centre
a
golden
blossom
but
from
before
the
third
shrine
in
the
farther
angle
of
the
chamber
the
curtains
have
been
withdrawn
and
these
are
of
gold
brocade
and
the
shrine
before
which
they
hang
is
the
chief
shrine
that
of
within
are
visible
only
some
of
the
ordinary
emblems
of
shinto
and
the
exterior
of
that
holy
of
holies
into
which
none
may
look
before
it
a
long
low
bench
covered
with
strange
objects
has
been
placed
with
one
end
toward
the
gallery
and
one
toward
the
alcove
at
the
end
of
this
bench
near
the
gallery
i
see
a
majestic
bearded
figure
strangely
coifed
and
robed
all
in
white
seated
upon
the
matted
floor
in
hierophantic
attitude
our
priestly
guide
motions
us
to
take
our
places
in
front
of
him
and
to
bow
down
before
him
for
this
is
senke
takanori
the
guji
of
kitzuki
to
whom
even
in
his
own
dwelling
none
may
speak
save
on
bended
knee
descendant
of
the
goddess
of
the
sun
and
still
by
multitudes
revered
in
thought
as
a
being
superhuman
prostrating
myself
before
him
according
to
the
customary
code
of
japanese
politeness
i
am
saluted
in
return
with
that
exquisite
courtesy
which
puts
a
stranger
immediately
at
ease
the
priest
who
acted
as
our
guide
now
sits
down
on
the
floor
at
the
guji
left
hand
while
the
other
priests
who
followed
us
to
the
entrance
of
the
sanctuary
only
take
their
places
upon
the
gallery
without
sec
senke
takanori
is
a
youthful
and
powerful
man
as
he
sits
there
before
me
in
his
immobile
hieratic
pose
with
his
strange
lofty
his
heavy
curling
beard
and
his
ample
snowy
sacerdotal
robe
broadly
spreading
about
him
in
statuesque
undulations
he
realises
for
me
all
that
i
had
imagined
from
the
suggestion
of
old
japanese
pictures
about
the
personal
majesty
of
the
ancient
princes
and
heroes
the
dignity
alone
of
the
man
would
irresistibly
compel
respect
but
with
that
feeling
of
respect
there
also
flashes
through
me
at
once
the
thought
of
the
profound
reverence
paid
him
by
the
population
of
the
most
ancient
province
of
japan
the
idea
of
the
immense
spiritual
power
in
his
hands
the
tradition
of
his
divine
descent
the
sense
of
the
immemorial
nobility
of
his
race
and
my
respect
deepens
into
a
feeling
closely
akin
to
awe
so
motionless
he
is
that
he
seems
a
sacred
statue
only
the
temple
image
of
one
of
his
own
deified
ancestors
but
the
solemnity
of
the
first
few
moments
is
agreeably
broken
by
his
first
words
uttered
in
a
low
rich
basso
while
his
dark
kindly
eyes
remain
motionlessly
fixed
upon
my
face
then
my
interpreter
translates
his
greeting
large
fine
phrases
of
courtesy
to
which
i
reply
as
i
best
know
how
expressing
my
gratitude
for
the
exceptional
favour
accorded
me
are
indeed
he
responds
through
akira
first
european
ever
permitted
to
enter
into
the
other
europeans
have
visited
kitzuki
and
a
few
have
been
allowed
to
enter
the
temple
court
but
you
only
have
been
admitted
into
the
dwelling
of
the
god
in
past
years
some
strangers
who
desired
to
visit
the
temple
out
of
common
curiosity
only
were
not
allowed
to
approach
even
the
court
but
the
letter
of
nishida
explaining
the
object
of
your
visit
has
made
it
a
pleasure
for
us
to
receive
you
thus
again
i
express
my
thanks
and
after
a
second
exchange
of
courtesies
the
conversation
continues
through
the
medium
of
akira
not
this
great
temple
of
kitzuki
i
inquire
than
the
temples
of
ise
by
far
replies
the
guji
old
indeed
that
we
do
not
well
know
the
age
of
it
for
it
was
first
built
by
order
of
the
goddess
of
the
sun
in
the
time
when
deities
alone
existed
then
it
was
exceedingly
magnificent
it
was
three
hundred
and
twenty
feet
high
the
beams
and
the
pillars
were
larger
than
any
existing
timber
could
furnish
and
the
framework
was
bound
together
firmly
with
a
rope
made
of
taku
fibre
one
thousand
fathoms
long
was
first
rebuilt
in
the
time
of
the
emperor
the
temple
so
rebuilt
by
order
of
the
emperor
was
called
the
structure
of
the
iron
rings
because
the
pieces
of
the
pillars
which
were
composed
of
the
wood
of
many
great
trees
had
been
bound
fast
together
with
huge
rings
of
iron
this
temple
was
also
splendid
but
far
less
splendid
than
the
first
which
had
been
built
by
the
gods
for
its
height
was
only
one
hundred
and
sixty
feet
third
time
the
temple
was
rebuilt
in
the
reign
of
the
empress
but
this
third
edifice
was
only
eighty
feet
high
since
then
the
structure
of
the
temple
has
never
varied
and
the
plan
then
followed
has
been
strictly
preserved
to
the
least
detail
in
the
construction
of
the
present
temple
has
been
rebuilt
times
and
it
has
been
the
custom
to
rebuild
it
every
years
but
in
the
long
period
of
civil
war
it
was
not
even
repaired
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
in
the
fourth
year
of
one
amako
tsune
hisa
becoming
lord
of
izumo
committed
the
great
temple
to
the
charge
of
a
buddhist
priest
and
even
built
pagodas
about
it
to
the
outrage
of
the
holy
traditions
but
when
the
amako
family
were
succeeded
by
moro
mototsugo
this
latter
purified
the
temple
and
restored
the
ancient
festivals
and
ceremonies
which
before
had
been
neglected
the
period
when
the
temple
was
built
upon
a
larger
scale
i
ask
the
timbers
for
its
construction
obtained
from
the
forests
of
izumo
the
priest
sasa
who
guided
us
into
the
shrine
makes
answer
is
recorded
that
on
the
fourth
day
of
the
seventh
month
of
the
third
year
of
one
hundred
large
trees
came
floating
to
the
sea
coast
of
kitzuki
and
were
stranded
there
by
the
tide
with
these
timbers
the
temple
was
rebuilt
in
the
third
year
of
and
that
structure
was
called
the
also
in
the
same
third
year
of
a
great
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
long
was
stranded
on
the
seashore
near
a
shrine
called
at
which
is
in
inaba
some
people
wanted
to
cut
the
tree
but
they
found
a
great
serpent
coiled
around
it
which
looked
so
terrible
that
they
became
frightened
and
prayed
to
the
deity
of
to
protect
them
and
the
deity
revealed
himself
and
said
whensoever
the
great
temple
in
izumo
is
to
be
rebuilt
one
of
the
gods
of
each
province
sends
timber
for
the
building
of
it
and
this
time
it
is
my
turn
build
quickly
therefore
with
that
great
tree
which
is
mine
and
therewith
the
god
disappeared
from
these
and
from
other
records
we
learn
that
the
deities
have
always
superintended
or
aided
the
building
of
the
great
temple
of
kitzuki
what
part
of
the
i
ask
the
august
deities
assemble
during
the
the
east
and
west
sides
of
the
inner
court
replies
the
priest
sasa
are
two
long
buildings
called
the
these
contain
nineteen
shrines
no
one
of
which
is
dedicated
to
any
particular
god
and
we
believe
it
is
in
the
that
the
gods
assemble
how
many
pilgrims
from
other
provinces
visit
the
great
shrine
yearly
i
inquire
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
the
guji
answers
the
number
increases
or
diminishes
according
to
the
condition
of
the
agricultural
classes
the
more
prosperous
the
season
the
larger
the
number
of
pilgrims
it
rarely
falls
below
two
hundred
thousand
sec
many
other
curious
things
the
guji
and
his
chief
priest
then
related
to
me
telling
me
the
sacred
name
of
each
of
the
courts
and
of
the
fences
and
holy
groves
and
the
multitudinous
shrines
and
their
divinities
even
the
names
of
the
great
pillars
of
the
temple
which
are
nine
in
number
the
central
pillar
being
called
the
august
of
the
middle
all
things
within
the
temple
grounds
have
sacred
names
even
the
torii
and
the
bridges
the
priest
sasa
called
my
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
great
shrine
of
faces
west
though
the
great
temple
faces
east
like
all
shinto
temples
in
the
other
two
shrines
of
the
same
apartment
both
facing
east
are
the
first
divine
kokuzo
of
izumo
his
seventeenth
descendant
and
the
father
of
nominosukune
wise
prince
and
famous
wrestler
for
in
the
reign
of
the
emperor
one
kehaya
of
taima
had
boasted
that
no
man
alive
was
equal
to
himself
in
strength
nominosukune
by
the
emperor
command
wrestled
with
kehaya
and
threw
him
down
so
mightily
that
kehaya
ghost
departed
from
him
this
was
the
beginning
of
wrestling
in
japan
and
wrestlers
still
pray
unto
nominosukune
for
power
and
skill
there
are
so
many
other
shrines
that
i
could
not
enumerate
the
names
of
all
their
deities
without
wearying
those
readers
unfamiliar
with
the
traditions
and
legends
of
shinto
but
nearly
all
those
divinities
who
appear
in
the
legend
of
the
master
of
the
great
land
are
still
believed
to
dwell
here
with
him
and
here
their
shrines
are
the
beautiful
one
magically
born
from
the
jewel
worn
in
the
tresses
of
the
goddess
of
the
sun
and
called
by
men
the
princess
and
the
daughter
of
the
lord
of
the
world
of
shadows
she
who
loved
the
master
of
the
great
land
and
followed
him
out
of
the
place
of
ghosts
to
become
his
wife
and
the
deity
called
grandson
of
the
of
who
first
made
a
and
platters
of
red
clay
for
the
august
banquet
of
the
god
at
kitzuki
and
many
of
the
heavenly
kindred
of
these
sec
the
priest
sasa
also
tells
me
this
when
naomasu
grandson
of
the
great
iyeyasu
and
first
daimyo
of
that
mighty
matsudaira
family
who
ruled
izumo
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
came
to
this
province
he
paid
a
visit
to
the
temple
of
kitzuki
and
demanded
that
the
miya
of
the
shrine
within
the
shrine
should
be
opened
that
he
might
look
upon
the
sacred
objects
upon
the
shintai
or
body
of
the
deity
and
this
being
an
impious
desire
both
of
the
kokuzo
unitedly
protested
against
it
but
despite
their
remonstrances
and
their
pleadings
he
persisted
angrily
in
his
demand
so
that
the
priests
found
themselves
compelled
to
open
the
shrine
and
the
miya
being
opened
naomasu
saw
within
it
a
great
awabi
of
nine
holes
so
large
that
it
concealed
everything
behind
it
and
when
he
drew
still
nearer
to
look
suddenly
the
awabi
changed
itself
into
a
huge
serpent
more
than
fifty
feet
in
length
and
it
massed
its
black
coils
before
the
opening
of
the
shrine
and
hissed
like
the
sound
of
raging
fire
and
looked
so
terrible
that
naomasu
and
those
with
him
fled
away
having
been
able
to
see
naught
else
and
ever
thereafter
naomasu
feared
and
reverenced
the
god
sec
the
guji
then
calls
my
attention
to
the
quaint
relics
lying
upon
the
long
low
bench
between
us
which
is
covered
with
white
silk
a
metal
mirror
found
in
preparing
the
foundation
of
the
temple
when
rebuilt
many
hundred
years
ago
magatama
jewels
of
onyx
and
jasper
a
chinese
flute
made
of
jade
a
few
superb
swords
the
gifts
of
shoguns
and
emperors
helmets
of
splendid
antique
workmanship
and
a
bundle
of
enormous
arrows
with
heads
of
brass
and
keenly
edged
after
i
have
looked
at
these
relics
and
learned
something
of
their
history
the
guji
rises
and
says
to
me
we
will
show
you
the
ancient
of
kitzuki
with
which
the
sacred
fire
is
kindled
descending
the
steps
we
pass
again
before
the
haiden
and
enter
a
spacious
edifice
on
one
side
of
the
court
of
nearly
equal
size
with
the
hall
of
prayer
here
i
am
agreeably
surprised
to
find
a
long
handsome
mahogany
table
at
one
end
of
the
main
apartment
into
which
we
are
ushered
and
mahogany
chairs
placed
all
about
it
for
the
reception
of
guests
i
am
motioned
to
one
chair
my
interpreter
to
another
and
the
guji
and
his
priests
take
their
seats
also
at
the
table
then
an
attendant
sets
before
me
a
handsome
bronze
stand
about
three
feet
long
on
which
rests
an
oblong
something
carefully
wrapped
in
cloths
the
guji
removes
the
wrappings
and
i
behold
the
most
primitive
form
of
known
to
exist
in
the
orient
it
is
simply
a
very
thick
piece
of
solid
white
plank
about
two
and
a
half
feet
long
with
a
line
of
holes
drilled
along
its
upper
edge
so
that
the
upper
part
of
each
hole
breaks
through
the
sides
of
the
plank
the
sticks
which
produce
the
fire
when
fixed
in
the
holes
and
rapidly
rubbed
between
the
palms
of
the
hands
are
made
of
a
lighter
kind
of
white
wood
they
are
about
two
feet
long
and
as
thick
as
a
common
lead
pencil
while
i
am
yet
examining
this
curious
simple
utensil
the
invention
of
which
tradition
ascribes
to
the
gods
and
modern
science
to
the
earliest
childhood
of
the
human
race
a
priest
places
upon
the
table
a
light
large
wooden
box
about
three
feet
long
eighteen
inches
wide
and
four
inches
high
at
the
sides
but
higher
in
the
middle
as
the
top
is
arched
like
the
shell
of
a
tortoise
this
object
is
made
of
the
same
hinoki
wood
as
the
drill
and
two
long
slender
sticks
are
laid
beside
it
i
at
first
suppose
it
to
be
another
but
no
human
being
could
guess
what
it
really
is
it
is
called
the
and
is
one
of
the
most
primitive
of
musical
instruments
the
little
sticks
are
used
to
strike
it
at
a
sign
from
the
guji
two
priests
place
the
box
upon
the
floor
seat
themselves
on
either
side
of
it
and
taking
up
the
little
sticks
begin
to
strike
the
lid
with
them
alternately
and
slowly
at
the
same
time
uttering
a
most
singular
and
monotonous
chant
one
intones
only
the
sounds
ang
and
the
other
responds
ong
the
gives
out
a
sharp
dead
hollow
sound
as
the
sticks
fall
upon
it
in
time
to
each
utterance
of
ang
ong
sec
these
things
i
learn
each
year
the
temple
receives
a
new
but
the
is
never
made
in
kitzuki
but
in
kumano
where
the
traditional
regulations
as
to
the
manner
of
making
it
have
been
preserved
from
the
time
of
the
gods
for
the
first
kokuzo
of
izumo
on
becoming
pontiff
received
the
for
the
great
temple
from
the
hands
of
the
deity
who
was
the
younger
brother
of
the
and
is
now
enshrined
at
kumano
and
from
his
time
the
for
the
of
kitzuki
have
been
made
only
at
kumano
until
very
recent
times
the
ceremony
of
delivering
the
new
to
the
guji
of
kitzuki
always
took
place
at
the
great
temple
of
oba
on
the
occasion
of
the
festival
called
unohimatauri
this
ancient
festival
which
used
to
be
held
in
the
eleventh
month
became
obsolete
after
the
revolution
everywhere
except
at
oba
in
izumo
where
the
mother
of
gods
and
men
is
enshrined
once
a
year
on
this
festival
the
kokuzo
always
went
to
oba
taking
with
him
a
gift
of
double
at
oba
he
was
met
by
a
personage
called
the
who
brought
the
from
kumano
and
delivered
it
to
the
priests
at
oba
according
to
tradition
the
had
to
act
a
somewhat
ludicrous
role
so
that
no
shinto
priest
ever
cared
to
perform
the
part
and
a
man
was
hired
for
it
the
duty
of
the
was
to
find
fault
with
the
gift
presented
to
the
temple
by
the
kokuzo
and
in
this
district
of
japan
there
is
still
a
proverbial
saying
about
one
who
is
prone
to
find
fault
without
reason
is
like
the
the
would
inspect
the
and
begin
to
criticise
them
are
much
smaller
this
year
he
would
observe
they
were
last
year
the
priests
would
reply
you
are
honourably
mistaken
they
are
in
truth
very
much
larger
colour
is
not
so
white
this
year
as
it
was
last
year
and
the
is
not
finely
ground
for
all
these
imaginary
faults
of
the
mochi
the
priests
would
offer
elaborate
explanations
or
apologies
at
the
conclusion
of
the
ceremony
the
sakaki
branches
used
in
it
were
eagerly
bid
for
and
sold
at
high
prices
being
believed
to
possess
talismanic
virtues
sec
it
nearly
always
happened
that
there
was
a
great
storm
either
on
the
day
the
kokuzo
went
to
oba
or
upon
the
day
he
returned
therefrom
the
journey
had
to
be
made
during
what
is
in
izumo
the
most
stormy
season
december
by
the
new
calendar
but
in
popular
belief
these
storms
were
in
some
tremendous
way
connected
with
the
divine
personality
of
the
kokuzo
whose
attributes
would
thus
appear
to
present
some
curious
analogy
with
those
of
the
be
that
as
it
may
the
great
periodical
storms
of
the
season
are
still
in
this
province
called
it
is
still
the
custom
in
izumo
to
say
merrily
to
the
guest
who
arrives
or
departs
in
a
time
of
tempest
you
are
like
the
kokuzo
sec
the
guji
waves
his
hand
and
from
the
farther
end
of
the
huge
apartment
there
comes
a
sudden
burst
of
strange
music
a
sound
of
drums
and
bamboo
flutes
and
turning
to
look
i
see
the
musicians
three
men
seated
upon
the
matting
and
a
young
girl
with
them
at
another
sign
from
the
guji
the
girl
rises
she
is
barefooted
and
robed
in
snowy
white
a
virgin
priestess
but
below
the
hem
of
the
white
robe
i
see
the
gleam
of
hakama
of
crimson
silk
she
advances
to
a
little
table
in
the
middle
of
the
apartment
upon
which
a
queer
instrument
is
lying
shaped
somewhat
like
a
branch
with
twigs
bent
downward
from
each
of
which
hangs
a
little
bell
taking
this
curious
object
in
both
hands
she
begins
a
sacred
dance
unlike
anything
i
ever
saw
before
her
every
movement
is
a
poem
because
she
is
very
graceful
and
yet
her
performance
could
scarcely
be
called
a
dance
as
we
understand
the
word
it
is
rather
a
light
swift
walk
within
a
circle
during
which
she
shakes
the
instrument
at
regular
intervals
making
all
the
little
bells
ring
her
face
remains
impassive
as
a
beautiful
mask
placid
and
sweet
as
the
face
of
a
dreaming
kwannon
and
her
white
feet
are
pure
of
line
as
the
feet
of
a
marble
nymph
altogether
with
her
snowy
raiment
and
white
flesh
and
passionless
face
she
seems
rather
a
beautiful
living
statue
than
a
japanese
maiden
and
all
the
while
the
weird
flutes
sob
and
shrill
and
the
muttering
of
the
drums
is
like
an
incantation
what
i
have
seen
is
called
the
dance
of
the
miko
the
divineress
sec
then
we
visit
the
other
edifices
belonging
to
the
temple
the
storehouse
the
library
the
hall
of
assembly
a
massive
structure
two
stories
high
where
may
be
seen
the
portraits
of
the
great
poets
painted
by
tosano
mitsu
oki
more
than
a
thousand
years
ago
and
still
in
an
excellent
state
of
preservation
here
we
are
also
shown
a
curious
magazine
published
monthly
by
the
temple
a
record
of
shinto
news
and
a
medium
for
the
discussion
of
questions
relating
to
the
archaic
texts
after
we
have
seen
all
the
curiosities
of
the
temple
the
guji
invites
us
to
his
private
residence
near
the
temple
to
show
us
other
treasures
letters
of
yoritomo
of
hideyoshi
of
iyeyasu
documents
in
the
handwriting
of
the
ancient
emperors
and
the
great
shoguns
hundreds
of
which
precious
manuscripts
he
keeps
in
a
cedar
chest
in
case
of
fire
the
immediate
removal
of
this
chest
to
a
place
of
safety
would
be
the
first
duty
of
the
servants
of
the
household
within
his
own
house
the
guji
attired
in
ordinary
japanese
full
dress
only
appears
no
less
dignified
as
a
private
gentleman
than
he
first
seemed
as
pontiff
in
his
voluminous
snowy
robe
but
no
host
could
be
more
kindly
or
more
courteous
or
more
generous
i
am
also
much
impressed
by
the
fine
appearance
of
his
suite
of
young
priests
now
dressed
like
himself
in
the
national
costume
by
the
handsome
aquiline
aristocratic
faces
totally
different
from
those
of
ordinary
japanese
faces
suggesting
the
soldier
rather
than
the
priest
one
young
man
has
a
superb
pair
of
thick
black
moustaches
which
is
something
rarely
to
be
seen
in
japan
at
parting
our
kind
host
presents
me
with
the
ofuda
or
sacred
charms
given
to
pilgrimsh
two
pretty
images
of
the
chief
deities
of
kitzuki
and
a
number
of
documents
relating
to
the
history
of
the
temple
and
of
its
treasures
sec
having
taken
our
leave
of
the
kind
guji
and
his
suite
we
are
guided
to
a
little
at
the
rear
of
the
town
by
the
priest
sasa
and
another
kannushi
this
priest
sasa
is
a
skilled
poet
and
a
man
of
deep
learning
in
shinto
history
and
the
archaic
texts
of
the
sacred
books
he
relates
to
us
many
curious
legends
as
we
stroll
along
the
shore
this
shore
now
a
popular
bathing
resort
bordered
with
airy
little
inns
and
pretty
is
called
inasa
because
of
a
shinto
tradition
that
here
the
god
the
was
first
asked
to
resign
his
dominion
over
the
land
of
izumo
in
favour
of
the
word
inasa
signifying
you
consent
or
not
in
the
section
of
the
first
volume
of
the
kojiki
the
legend
is
written
i
cite
a
part
thereof
two
deities
and
descending
to
the
little
shore
of
inasa
in
the
land
of
izumo
drew
their
swords
ten
handbreadths
long
and
stuck
them
upside
down
on
the
crest
of
a
wave
and
seated
themselves
upon
the
points
of
the
swords
and
asked
the
deity
saying
the
and
the
have
charged
us
and
sent
us
to
ask
saying
have
deigned
to
charge
our
august
child
with
thy
dominion
as
the
land
which
he
should
govern
so
how
is
thy
heart
he
replied
saying
i
am
unable
to
say
my
son
will
be
the
one
to
tell
you
so
they
asked
the
deity
again
saying
thy
son
has
now
spoken
thus
hast
thou
other
sons
who
should
speak
he
spoke
again
saying
there
is
my
other
son
while
he
was
thus
speaking
the
deity
came
up
from
the
sea
bearing
on
the
tips
of
his
fingers
a
rock
which
it
would
take
a
thousand
men
to
lift
and
said
i
should
like
to
have
a
trial
of
strength
here
close
to
the
beach
stands
a
little
miya
called
or
the
temple
of
the
god
of
inasa
and
therein
who
conquered
in
the
trial
of
strength
is
enshrined
and
near
the
shore
the
great
rock
which
lifted
upon
the
tips
of
his
fingers
may
be
seen
rising
from
the
water
and
it
is
called
we
invite
the
priests
to
dine
with
us
at
one
of
the
little
inns
facing
the
breezy
sea
and
there
we
talk
about
many
things
but
particularly
about
kitzuki
and
the
kokuzo
sec
only
a
generation
ago
the
religious
power
of
the
kokuzo
extended
over
the
whole
of
the
province
of
the
gods
he
was
in
fact
as
well
as
in
name
the
spiritual
governor
of
izumo
his
jurisdiction
does
not
now
extend
beyond
the
limits
of
kitzuki
and
his
correct
title
is
no
longer
kokuzo
but
guji
yet
to
the
people
of
remoter
districts
he
is
still
a
divine
or
being
and
is
mentioned
by
his
ancient
title
the
inheritance
of
his
race
from
the
epoch
of
the
gods
how
profound
a
reverence
was
paid
to
him
in
former
ages
can
scarcely
be
imagined
by
any
who
have
not
long
lived
among
the
country
folk
of
izumo
outside
of
japan
perhaps
no
human
being
except
the
dalai
lama
of
thibet
was
so
humbly
venerated
and
so
religiously
beloved
within
japan
itself
only
the
son
of
heaven
the
standing
as
mediator
his
people
and
the
sun
received
like
homage
but
the
worshipful
reverence
paid
to
the
mikado
was
paid
to
a
dream
rather
than
to
a
person
to
a
name
rather
than
to
a
reality
for
the
was
ever
invisible
as
a
deity
retired
and
in
popular
belief
no
man
could
look
upon
his
face
and
live
invisibility
and
mystery
vastly
enhanced
the
divine
legend
of
the
mikado
but
the
kokuzo
within
his
own
province
though
visible
to
the
multitude
and
often
journeying
among
the
people
received
almost
equal
devotion
so
that
his
material
power
though
rarely
if
ever
exercised
was
scarcely
less
than
that
of
the
daimyo
of
izumo
himself
it
was
indeed
large
enough
to
render
him
a
person
with
whom
the
shogunate
would
have
deemed
it
wise
policy
to
remain
upon
good
terms
an
ancestor
of
the
present
guji
even
defied
the
great
taiko
hideyoshi
refusing
to
obey
his
command
to
furnish
troops
with
the
haughty
answer
that
he
would
receive
no
order
from
a
man
of
common
birth
this
defiance
cost
the
family
the
loss
of
a
large
part
of
its
estates
by
confiscation
but
the
real
power
of
the
kokuzo
remained
unchanged
until
the
period
of
the
new
civilisation
out
of
many
hundreds
of
stories
of
a
similar
nature
two
little
traditions
may
be
cited
as
illustrations
of
the
reverence
in
which
the
kokuzo
was
formerly
held
it
is
related
that
there
was
a
man
who
believing
himself
to
have
become
rich
by
favour
of
the
daikoku
of
kitzuki
desired
to
express
his
gratitude
by
a
gift
of
robes
to
the
kokuzo
the
kokuzo
courteously
declined
the
proffer
but
the
pious
worshipper
persisted
in
his
purpose
and
ordered
a
tailor
to
make
the
robes
the
tailor
having
made
them
demanded
a
price
that
almost
took
his
breath
away
being
asked
to
give
his
reason
for
demanding
such
a
price
he
made
answer
having
made
robes
for
the
kokuzo
i
can
not
hereafter
make
garments
for
any
other
person
therefore
i
must
have
money
enough
to
support
me
for
the
rest
of
my
life
the
second
story
dates
back
to
about
one
hundred
and
seventy
years
ago
among
the
samurai
of
the
matsue
clan
in
the
time
of
nobukori
fifth
daimyo
of
the
matsudaira
family
there
was
one
sugihara
kitoji
who
was
stationed
in
some
military
capacity
at
kitzuki
he
was
a
great
favourite
with
the
kokuzo
and
used
often
to
play
at
chess
with
him
during
a
game
one
evening
this
officer
suddenly
became
as
one
paralysed
unable
to
move
or
speak
for
a
moment
all
was
anxiety
and
confusion
but
the
kokuzo
said
know
the
cause
my
friend
was
smoking
and
although
smoking
disagrees
with
me
i
did
not
wish
to
spoil
his
pleasure
by
telling
him
so
but
the
kami
seeing
that
i
felt
ill
became
angry
with
him
now
i
shall
make
him
well
whereupon
the
kokuzo
uttered
some
magical
word
and
the
officer
was
immediately
as
well
as
before
sec
once
more
we
are
journeying
through
the
silence
of
this
holy
land
of
mists
and
of
legends
wending
our
way
between
green
leagues
of
ripening
rice
with
arrows
of
prayer
between
the
far
processions
of
blue
and
verdant
peaks
whose
names
are
the
names
of
gods
we
have
left
kitzuki
far
behind
but
as
in
a
dream
i
still
see
the
mighty
avenue
the
long
succession
of
torii
with
their
colossal
shimenawa
the
majestic
face
of
the
guji
the
kindly
smile
of
the
priest
sasa
and
the
girl
priestess
in
her
snowy
robes
dancing
her
beautiful
ghostly
dance
it
seems
to
me
that
i
can
still
hear
the
sound
of
the
clapping
of
hands
like
the
crashing
of
a
torrent
i
can
not
suppress
some
slight
exultation
at
the
thought
that
i
have
been
allowed
to
see
what
no
other
foreigner
has
been
privileged
to
see
the
interior
of
japan
most
ancient
shrine
and
those
sacred
utensils
and
quaint
rites
of
primitive
worship
so
well
worthy
the
study
of
the
anthropologist
and
the
evolutionist
but
to
have
seen
kitzuki
as
i
saw
it
is
also
to
have
seen
something
much
more
than
a
single
wonderful
temple
to
see
kitzuki
is
to
see
the
living
centre
of
shinto
and
to
feel
the
of
the
ancient
faith
throbbing
as
mightily
in
this
nineteenth
century
as
ever
in
that
unknown
past
whereof
the
kojiki
itself
though
written
in
a
tongue
no
longer
spoken
is
but
a
modern
record
buddhism
changing
form
or
slowly
decaying
through
the
centuries
might
seem
doomed
to
pass
away
at
last
from
this
japan
to
which
it
came
only
as
an
alien
faith
but
shinto
unchanging
and
vitally
unchanged
still
remains
all
dominant
in
the
land
of
its
birth
and
only
seems
to
gain
in
power
and
dignity
with
time
buddhism
has
a
voluminous
theology
a
profound
philosophy
a
literature
vast
as
the
sea
shinto
has
no
philosophy
no
code
of
ethics
no
metaphysics
and
yet
by
its
very
immateriality
it
can
resist
the
invasion
of
occidental
religious
thought
as
no
other
orient
faith
can
shinto
extends
a
welcome
to
western
science
but
remains
the
irresistible
opponent
of
western
religion
and
the
foreign
zealots
who
would
strive
against
it
are
astounded
to
find
the
power
that
foils
their
uttermost
efforts
indefinable
as
magnetism
and
invulnerable
as
air
indeed
the
best
of
our
scholars
have
never
been
able
to
tell
us
what
shinto
is
to
some
it
appears
to
be
merely
to
others
combined
with
to
others
again
it
seems
to
be
no
religion
at
all
to
the
missionary
of
the
more
ignorant
class
it
is
the
worst
form
of
heathenism
doubtless
the
difficulty
of
explaining
shinto
has
been
due
simply
to
the
fact
that
the
sinologists
have
sought
for
the
source
of
it
in
books
in
the
kojiki
and
the
nihongi
which
are
its
histories
in
the
norito
which
are
its
prayers
in
the
commentaries
of
motowori
and
hirata
who
were
its
greatest
scholars
but
the
reality
of
shinto
lives
not
in
books
nor
in
rites
nor
in
commandments
but
in
the
national
heart
of
which
it
is
the
highest
emotional
religious
expression
immortal
and
ever
young
far
underlying
all
the
surface
crop
of
quaint
superstitions
and
artless
myths
and
fantastic
magic
there
thrills
a
mighty
spiritual
force
the
whole
soul
of
a
race
with
all
its
impulses
and
powers
and
intuitions
he
who
would
know
what
shinto
is
must
learn
to
know
that
mysterious
soul
in
which
the
sense
of
beauty
and
the
power
of
art
and
the
fire
of
heroism
and
magnetism
of
loyalty
and
the
emotion
of
faith
have
become
inherent
immanent
unconscious
instinctive
trusting
to
know
something
of
that
oriental
soul
in
whose
joyous
love
of
nature
and
of
life
even
the
unlearned
may
discern
a
strange
likeness
to
the
soul
of
the
old
greek
race
i
trust
also
that
i
may
presume
some
day
to
speak
of
the
great
living
power
of
that
faith
now
called
shinto
but
more
anciently
or
way
of
the
gods
chapter
nine
in
the
cave
of
the
children
ghosts
sec
it
is
forbidden
to
go
to
kaka
if
there
be
wind
enough
move
three
hairs
now
an
absolutely
windless
day
is
rare
on
this
wild
western
coast
over
the
japanese
sea
from
korea
or
china
or
boreal
siberia
some
west
or
breeze
is
nearly
always
blowing
so
that
i
have
had
to
wait
many
long
months
for
a
good
chance
to
visit
kaka
taking
the
shortest
route
one
goes
first
to
from
matsue
either
by
kuruma
or
on
foot
by
kuruma
this
little
journey
occupies
nearly
two
hours
and
a
half
though
the
distance
is
scarcely
seven
miles
the
road
being
one
of
the
worst
in
all
izumo
you
leave
matsue
to
enter
at
once
into
a
broad
plain
level
as
a
lake
all
occupied
by
and
walled
in
by
wooded
hills
the
path
barely
wide
enough
for
a
single
vehicle
traverses
this
green
desolation
climbs
the
heights
beyond
it
and
descends
again
into
another
and
a
larger
level
of
surrounded
also
by
hills
the
path
over
the
second
line
of
hills
is
much
steeper
then
a
third
must
be
crossed
and
a
third
chain
of
green
altitudes
lofty
enough
to
merit
the
name
of
mountains
of
course
one
must
make
the
ascent
on
foot
it
is
no
small
labour
for
a
kurumaya
to
pull
even
an
empty
kuruma
up
to
the
top
and
how
he
manages
to
do
so
without
breaking
the
little
vehicle
is
a
mystery
for
the
path
is
stony
and
rough
as
the
bed
of
a
torrent
a
tiresome
climb
i
find
it
but
the
landscape
view
from
the
summit
is
more
than
compensation
then
descending
there
remains
a
fourth
and
last
wide
level
of
to
traverse
the
absolute
flatness
of
the
great
plains
between
the
ranges
and
the
singular
way
in
which
these
latter
off
the
country
into
sections
are
matters
for
surprise
even
in
a
land
of
surprises
like
japan
beyond
the
fourth
there
is
a
fourth
lower
and
richly
wooded
on
reaching
the
base
of
which
the
traveller
must
finally
abandon
his
kuruma
and
proceed
over
the
hills
on
foot
behind
them
lies
the
sea
but
the
very
worst
bit
of
the
journey
now
begins
the
path
makes
an
easy
winding
ascent
between
bamboo
growths
and
young
pine
and
other
vegetation
for
a
shaded
quarter
of
a
mile
passing
before
various
little
shrines
and
pretty
homesteads
surrounded
by
gardens
then
it
suddenly
breaks
into
steps
or
rather
ruins
of
steps
partly
hewn
in
the
rock
partly
built
everywhere
breached
and
worn
which
descend
all
edgeless
in
a
manner
amazingly
precipitous
to
the
village
of
with
straw
sandals
which
never
slip
the
country
folk
can
nimbly
hurry
up
or
down
such
a
path
but
with
foreign
footgear
one
slips
at
nearly
every
step
and
when
you
reach
the
bottom
at
last
the
wonder
of
how
you
managed
to
get
there
even
with
the
assistance
of
your
faithful
kurumaya
keeps
you
for
a
moment
quite
unconscious
of
the
fact
that
you
are
already
in
sec
stands
with
its
back
to
the
mountains
at
the
end
of
a
small
deep
bay
hemmed
in
by
very
high
cliffs
there
is
only
one
narrow
strip
of
beach
at
the
foot
of
the
heights
and
the
village
owes
its
existence
to
that
fact
for
beaches
are
rare
on
this
part
of
the
coast
crowded
between
the
cliffs
and
the
sea
the
houses
have
a
painfully
compressed
aspect
and
somehow
the
greater
number
give
one
the
impression
of
things
created
out
of
wrecks
of
junks
the
little
streets
or
rather
alleys
are
full
of
boats
and
skeletons
of
boats
and
boat
timbers
and
everywhere
suspended
from
bamboo
poles
much
taller
than
the
houses
immense
bright
brown
are
drying
in
the
sun
the
whole
curve
of
the
beach
is
also
lined
with
boats
lying
side
by
side
so
that
i
wonder
how
it
will
be
possible
to
get
to
the
water
edge
without
climbing
over
them
there
is
no
hotel
but
i
find
hospitality
in
a
fisherman
dwelling
while
my
kurumaya
goes
somewhere
to
hire
a
boat
for
in
less
than
ten
minutes
there
is
a
crowd
of
several
hundred
people
about
the
house
adults
and
perfectly
naked
boys
they
blockade
the
building
they
obscure
the
light
by
filling
up
the
doorways
and
climbing
into
the
windows
to
look
at
the
foreigner
the
aged
proprietor
of
the
cottage
protests
in
vain
says
harsh
things
the
crowd
only
thickens
then
all
the
sliding
screens
are
closed
but
in
the
paper
panes
there
are
holes
and
at
all
the
lower
holes
the
curious
take
regular
turns
at
peeping
at
a
higher
hole
i
do
some
peeping
myself
the
crowd
is
not
prepossessing
it
is
squalid
remarkably
ugly
but
it
is
gentle
and
silent
and
there
are
one
or
two
pretty
faces
in
it
which
seem
extraordinary
by
reason
of
the
general
homeliness
of
the
rest
at
last
my
kurumaya
has
succeeded
in
making
arrangements
for
a
boat
and
i
effect
a
sortie
to
the
beach
followed
by
the
kurumaya
and
by
all
my
besiegers
boats
have
been
moved
to
make
a
passage
for
us
and
we
embark
without
trouble
of
any
sort
our
crew
consists
of
two
scullers
an
old
man
at
the
stem
wearing
only
a
rokushaku
about
his
loins
and
an
old
woman
at
the
bow
fully
robed
and
wearing
an
immense
straw
hat
shaped
like
a
mushroom
both
of
course
stand
to
their
work
and
it
would
be
hard
to
say
which
is
the
stronger
or
more
skilful
sculler
we
passengers
squat
oriental
fashion
upon
a
mat
in
the
centre
of
the
boat
where
a
hibachi
well
stocked
with
glowing
charcoal
invites
us
to
smoke
sec
the
day
is
clear
blue
to
the
end
of
the
world
with
a
faint
wind
from
the
east
barely
enough
to
wrinkle
the
sea
certainly
more
than
enough
to
three
hairs
nevertheless
the
boatwoman
and
the
boatman
do
not
seem
anxious
and
i
begin
to
wonder
whether
the
famous
prohibition
is
not
a
myth
so
delightful
the
transparent
water
looks
that
before
we
have
left
the
bay
i
have
to
yield
to
its
temptation
by
plunging
in
and
swimming
after
the
boat
when
i
climb
back
on
board
we
are
rounding
the
promontory
on
the
right
and
the
little
vessel
begins
to
rock
even
under
this
thin
wind
the
sea
is
moving
in
long
swells
and
as
we
pass
into
the
open
following
the
westward
trend
of
the
land
we
find
ourselves
gliding
over
an
depth
in
front
of
one
of
the
very
grimmest
coasts
i
ever
saw
a
tremendous
line
of
dark
cliffs
towering
sheer
from
the
sea
without
a
beach
and
with
never
a
speck
of
green
below
their
summits
and
here
and
there
along
this
terrible
front
monstrous
beetlings
breaches
fissures
earthquake
rendings
and
enormous
fractures
show
lines
of
strata
pitched
up
skyward
or
plunging
down
into
the
ocean
with
the
long
fall
of
cubic
miles
of
cliff
before
fantastic
gaps
prodigious
masses
of
rock
of
all
nightmarish
shapes
rise
from
profundities
unfathomed
and
though
the
wind
seems
trying
to
hold
its
breath
white
breakers
are
reaching
far
up
the
cliffs
and
dashing
their
foam
into
the
faces
of
the
splintered
crags
we
are
too
far
to
hear
the
thunder
of
them
but
their
ominous
fully
explains
to
me
the
story
of
the
three
hairs
along
this
goblin
coast
on
a
wild
day
there
would
be
no
possible
chance
for
the
strongest
swimmer
or
the
stoutest
boat
there
is
no
place
for
the
foot
no
hold
for
the
hand
nothing
but
the
sea
raving
against
a
precipice
of
iron
even
under
the
feeblest
breath
imaginable
great
swells
deluge
us
with
spray
as
they
splash
past
and
for
two
long
hours
this
jagged
frowning
coast
towers
by
and
as
we
toil
on
rocks
rise
around
us
like
black
teeth
and
always
far
away
the
gleam
at
the
feet
of
the
implacable
cliffs
but
there
are
no
sounds
save
the
lapping
and
plashing
of
passing
swells
and
the
monotonous
creaking
of
the
sculls
upon
their
pegs
of
wood
at
last
at
last
a
bay
a
beautiful
large
bay
with
a
demilune
of
soft
green
hills
about
it
overtopped
by
far
blue
mountains
and
in
the
very
farthest
point
of
the
bay
a
miniature
village
in
front
of
which
many
junks
are
riding
at
anchor
but
we
do
not
go
to
yet
the
kukedo
are
not
there
we
cross
the
broad
opening
of
the
bay
journey
along
another
of
ghastly
and
finally
make
for
a
lofty
promontory
of
naked
plutonic
rock
we
pass
by
its
menacing
foot
slip
along
its
side
and
lo
at
an
angle
opens
the
arched
mouth
of
a
wonderful
cavern
broad
lofty
and
full
of
light
with
no
floor
but
the
sea
beneath
us
as
we
slip
into
it
i
can
see
rocks
fully
twenty
feet
down
the
water
is
clear
as
air
this
is
the
called
the
new
cavern
though
assuredly
older
than
human
record
by
a
hundred
thousand
years
sec
a
more
beautiful
could
scarcely
be
imagined
the
sea
tunnelling
the
tall
promontory
through
and
through
has
also
like
a
great
architect
ribbed
and
groined
and
polished
its
mighty
work
the
arch
of
the
entrance
is
certainly
twenty
feet
above
the
deep
water
and
fifteen
wide
and
trillions
of
wave
tongues
have
licked
the
vault
and
walls
into
wondrous
smoothness
as
we
proceed
the
steadily
heightens
and
the
way
widens
then
we
unexpectedly
glide
under
a
heavy
shower
of
fresh
water
dripping
from
overhead
this
spring
is
called
the
or
mitarashi
of
from
the
high
vault
at
this
point
it
is
believed
that
a
great
stone
will
detach
itself
and
fall
upon
any
person
who
should
attempt
to
enter
the
cave
i
safely
pass
through
the
ordeal
suddenly
as
we
advance
the
boatwoman
takes
a
stone
from
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
with
it
begins
to
rap
heavily
on
the
bow
and
the
hollow
echoing
is
reiterated
with
thundering
repercussions
through
all
the
cave
and
in
another
instant
we
pass
into
a
great
burst
of
light
coming
from
the
mouth
of
a
magnificent
and
lofty
archway
on
the
left
opening
into
the
cavern
at
right
angles
this
explains
the
singular
illumination
of
the
long
vault
which
at
first
seemed
to
come
from
beneath
for
while
the
opening
was
still
invisible
all
the
water
appeared
to
be
suffused
with
light
through
this
grand
arch
between
outlying
rocks
a
strip
of
beautiful
green
undulating
coast
appears
over
miles
of
azure
water
we
glide
on
toward
the
third
entrance
to
the
kukedo
opposite
to
that
by
which
we
came
in
and
enter
the
of
the
kami
and
the
hotoke
for
this
grotto
is
sacred
both
to
shinto
and
to
buddhist
faith
here
the
kukedo
reaches
its
greatest
altitude
and
breadth
its
vault
is
fully
forty
feet
above
the
water
and
its
walls
thirty
feet
apart
far
up
on
the
right
near
the
roof
is
a
projecting
white
rock
and
above
the
rock
an
orifice
wherefrom
a
slow
stream
drips
seeming
white
as
the
rock
itself
this
is
the
legendary
fountain
of
jizo
the
fountain
of
milk
at
which
the
souls
of
dead
children
drink
sometimes
it
flows
more
swiftly
sometimes
more
slowly
but
it
never
ceases
by
night
or
day
and
mothers
suffering
from
want
of
milk
come
hither
to
pray
that
milk
may
be
given
unto
them
and
their
prayer
is
heard
and
mothers
having
more
milk
than
their
infants
need
come
hither
also
and
pray
to
jizo
that
so
much
as
they
can
give
may
be
taken
for
the
dead
children
and
their
prayer
is
heard
and
their
milk
diminishes
at
least
thus
the
peasants
of
izumo
say
and
the
echoing
of
the
swells
leaping
against
the
rocks
without
the
rushing
and
rippling
of
the
tide
against
the
walls
the
heavy
rain
of
percolating
water
sounds
of
lapping
and
gurgling
and
plashing
and
sounds
of
mysterious
origin
coming
from
no
visible
where
make
it
difficult
for
us
to
hear
each
other
speak
the
cavern
seems
full
of
voices
as
if
a
host
of
invisible
beings
were
holding
tumultuous
converse
below
us
all
the
deeply
lying
rocks
are
naked
to
view
as
if
seen
through
glass
it
seems
to
me
that
nothing
could
be
more
delightful
than
to
swim
through
this
cave
and
let
one
self
drift
with
the
through
all
its
cool
shadows
but
as
i
am
on
the
point
of
jumping
in
all
the
other
occupants
of
the
boat
utter
wild
cries
of
protest
it
is
certain
death
men
who
jumped
in
here
only
six
months
ago
were
never
heard
of
again
this
is
sacred
water
and
as
if
to
conjure
away
my
temptation
the
boatwoman
again
seizes
her
little
stone
and
raps
fearfully
upon
the
bow
on
finding
however
that
i
am
not
sufficiently
deterred
by
these
stories
of
sudden
death
and
disappearance
she
suddenly
screams
into
my
ear
the
magical
word
sharks
i
have
no
longer
any
desire
whatever
to
swim
through
the
halls
of
i
have
lived
in
the
tropics
and
we
start
forthwith
for
the
ancient
cavern
sec
for
the
ghastly
fancies
about
the
the
word
afforded
a
satisfactory
explanation
but
why
that
long
loud
weird
rapping
on
the
bow
with
a
stone
evidently
kept
on
board
for
no
other
purpose
there
was
an
exaggerated
earnestness
about
the
action
which
gave
me
an
uncanny
sensation
something
like
that
which
moves
a
man
while
walking
at
night
upon
a
lonesome
road
full
of
queer
shadows
to
sing
at
the
top
of
his
voice
the
boatwoman
at
first
declares
that
the
rapping
was
made
only
for
the
sake
of
the
singular
echo
but
after
some
cautious
further
questioning
i
discover
a
much
more
sinister
reason
for
the
performance
moreover
i
learn
that
all
the
seamen
and
seawomen
of
this
coast
do
the
same
thing
when
passing
through
perilous
places
or
places
believed
to
be
haunted
by
the
ma
what
are
the
ma
goblins
sec
from
the
caves
of
the
kami
we
retrace
our
course
for
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
then
make
directly
for
an
immense
perpendicular
wrinkle
in
the
long
line
of
black
cliffs
immediately
before
it
a
huge
dark
rock
towers
from
the
sea
whipped
by
the
foam
of
breaking
swells
rounding
it
we
glide
behind
it
into
still
water
and
shadow
the
shadow
of
a
monstrous
cleft
in
the
precipice
of
the
coast
and
suddenly
at
an
unsuspected
angle
the
mouth
of
another
cavern
yawns
before
us
and
in
another
moment
our
boat
touches
its
threshold
of
stone
with
a
little
shock
that
sends
a
long
sonorous
echo
like
the
sound
of
a
temple
drum
booming
through
all
the
abysmal
place
a
single
glance
tells
me
whither
we
have
come
far
within
the
dusk
i
see
the
face
of
a
jizo
smiling
in
pale
stone
and
before
him
and
all
about
him
a
weird
congregation
of
grey
shapes
without
shape
a
host
of
fantasticalities
that
strangely
suggest
the
wreck
of
a
cemetery
from
the
sea
the
ribbed
floor
of
the
cavern
slopes
high
through
deepening
shadows
back
to
the
black
mouth
of
a
farther
grotto
and
all
that
slope
is
covered
with
hundreds
and
thousands
of
forms
like
shattered
haka
but
as
the
eyes
grow
accustomed
to
the
gloaming
it
becomes
manifest
that
these
were
never
haka
they
are
only
little
towers
of
stone
and
pebbles
deftly
piled
up
by
long
and
patient
labour
kodomo
no
shigoto
my
kurumaya
murmurs
with
a
compassionate
smile
this
is
the
work
of
the
dead
children
and
we
disembark
by
counsel
i
take
off
my
shoes
and
put
on
a
pair
of
zori
or
straw
sandals
provided
for
me
as
the
rock
is
extremely
slippery
the
others
land
barefoot
but
how
to
proceed
soon
becomes
a
puzzle
the
countless
stand
so
close
together
that
no
space
for
the
foot
seems
to
be
left
between
them
michiga
arimasu
the
boatwoman
announces
leading
the
way
there
is
a
path
following
after
her
we
squeeze
ourselves
between
the
wall
of
the
cavern
on
the
right
and
some
large
rocks
and
discover
a
very
very
narrow
passage
left
open
between
the
but
we
are
warned
to
be
careful
for
the
sake
of
the
little
ghosts
if
any
of
their
work
be
overturned
they
will
cry
so
we
move
very
cautiously
and
slowly
across
the
cave
to
a
space
bare
of
where
the
rocky
floor
is
covered
with
a
thin
layer
of
sand
detritus
of
a
crumbling
ledge
above
it
and
in
that
sand
i
see
light
prints
of
little
feet
children
feet
tiny
naked
feet
only
three
or
four
inches
long
the
footprints
of
the
infant
ghosts
had
we
come
earlier
the
boatwoman
says
we
should
have
seen
many
more
for
is
at
night
when
the
soil
of
the
cavern
is
moist
with
dews
and
drippings
from
the
roof
that
they
leave
their
footprints
upon
it
but
when
the
heat
of
the
day
comes
and
the
sand
and
the
rocks
dry
up
the
prints
of
the
little
feet
vanish
away
there
are
only
three
footprints
visible
but
these
are
singularly
distinct
one
points
toward
the
wall
of
the
cavern
the
others
toward
the
sea
here
and
there
upon
ledges
or
projections
of
the
rock
all
about
the
cavern
tiny
straw
sandals
children
zori
are
lying
offerings
of
pilgrims
to
the
little
ones
that
their
feet
may
not
be
wounded
by
the
stones
but
all
the
ghostly
footprints
are
prints
of
naked
feet
then
we
advance
picking
our
way
very
very
carefully
between
the
toward
the
mouth
of
the
inner
grotto
and
reach
the
statue
of
jizo
before
it
a
seated
jizo
carven
in
granite
holding
in
one
hand
the
mystic
jewel
by
virtue
of
which
all
wishes
may
be
fulfilled
in
the
other
his
shakujo
or
pilgrim
staff
before
him
strange
condescension
of

a
little
torii
has
been
erected
and
a
pair
of

evidently
this
gentle
divinity
has
no
enemies
at
the
feet
of
the
lover
of
children
ghosts
both
creeds
unite
in
tender
homage
i
said
feet
but
this
subterranean
jizo
has
only
one
foot
the
carven
lotus
on
which
he
reposes
has
been
fractured
and
broken
two
great
petals
are
missing
and
the
right
foot
which
must
have
rested
upon
one
of
them
has
been
knocked
off
at
the
ankle
this
i
learn
upon
inquiry
has
been
done
by
the
waves
in
times
of
great
storm
the
billows
rush
into
the
cavern
like
raging
oni
and
sweep
all
the
little
stone
towers
into
shingle
as
they
come
and
dash
the
statues
against
the
rocks
but
always
during
the
first
still
night
after
the
tempest
the
work
is
reconstructed
as
before

again
they
rebuild
their
towers
of
prayer
all
about
the
black
mouth
of
the
inner
grotto
the
rock
bears
some
resemblance
to
a
vast
pair
of
yawning
jaws
downward
from
this
sinister
portal
the
slopes
into
a
deeper
and
darker
aperture
and
within
it
as
one
eyes
become
accustomed
to
the
gloom
a
still
larger
vision
of
stone
towers
is
disclosed
and
beyond
them
in
a
nook
of
the
grotto
three
other
statues
of
jizo
smile
each
one
with
a
torii
before
it
here
i
have
the
misfortune
to
upset
first
one
and
then
another
while
trying
to
proceed
my
kurumaya
almost
simultaneously
ruins
a
third
to
atone
therefore
we
must
build
six
new
towers
or
double
the
number
of
those
which
we
have
cast
down
and
while
we
are
thus
busied
the
boatwoman
tells
of
two
fishermen
who
remained
in
the
cavern
through
all
one
night
and
heard
the
humming
of
the
viewless
gathering
and
sounds
of
speech
like
the
speech
of
children
murmuring
in
multitude
only
at
night
do
the
shadowy
children
come
to
build
their
little
at
the
feet
of
jizo
and
it
is
said
that
every
night
the
stones
are
changed
when
i
ask
why
they
do
not
work
by
day
when
there
is
none
to
see
them
i
am
answered
might
see
them
the
dead
exceedingly
fear
the
to
the
question
do
they
come
from
the
sea
i
can
get
no
satisfactory
answer
but
doubtless
in
the
quaint
imagination
of
this
people
as
also
in
that
of
many
another
there
lingers
still
the
primitive
idea
of
some
communication
mysterious
and
awful
between
the
world
of
waters
and
the
world
of
the
dead
it
is
always
over
the
sea
after
the
feast
of
souls
that
the
spirits
pass
murmuring
back
to
their
dim
realm
in
those
elfish
little
ships
of
straw
which
are
launched
for
them
upon
the
sixteenth
day
of
the
seventh
moon
even
when
these
are
launched
upon
rivers
or
when
floating
lanterns
are
set
adrift
upon
lakes
or
canals
to
light
the
ghosts
upon
their
way
or
when
a
mother
bereaved
drops
into
some
running
stream
one
hundred
little
prints
of
jizo
for
the
sake
of
her
lost
darling
the
vague
idea
behind
the
pious
act
is
that
all
waters
flow
to
the
sea
and
the
sea
itself
unto
the
land
some
time
somewhere
this
day
will
come
back
to
me
at
night
with
its
visions
and
sounds
the
dusky
cavern
and
its
grey
hosts
of
stone
climbing
back
into
darkness
and
the
faint
prints
of
little
naked
feet
and
the
weirdly
smiling
images
and
the
broken
syllables
of
the
waters
multiplied
by
husky
echoings
blending
into
one
vast
ghostly
whispering
like
the
humming
of
the
and
over
the
bay
we
glide
to
the
rocky
beach
of
sec
as
at
the
water
edge
is
occupied
by
a
serried
line
of
each
with
its
nose
to
the
sea
and
behind
these
are
ranks
of
others
and
it
is
only
just
barely
possible
to
squeeze
one
way
between
them
over
the
beach
to
the
drowsy
pretty
quaint
little
streets
behind
them
everybody
seems
to
be
asleep
when
we
first
land
the
only
living
creature
visible
is
a
cat
sitting
on
the
stern
of
a
boat
and
even
that
cat
according
to
japanese
beliefs
might
not
be
a
real
cat
but
an
or
a
nekomata
in
short
a
for
it
has
a
long
tail
it
is
hard
work
to
discover
the
solitary
hotel
there
are
no
signs
and
every
house
seems
a
private
house
either
a
fisherman
or
a
farmer
but
the
little
place
is
worth
wandering
about
in
a
kind
of
yellow
stucco
is
here
employed
to
cover
the
exterior
of
walls
and
this
light
warm
tint
under
the
bright
blue
day
gives
to
the
miniature
streets
a
more
than
cheerful
aspect
when
we
do
finally
discover
the
hotel
we
have
to
wait
quite
a
good
while
before
going
in
for
nothing
is
ready
everybody
is
asleep
or
away
though
all
the
screens
and
are
open
evidently
there
are
no
thieves
in
the
hotel
is
on
a
little
hillock
and
is
approached
from
the
main
street
the
rest
are
only
miniature
alleys
by
two
little
flights
of
stone
steps
immediately
across
the
way
i
see
a
zen
temple
and
a
shinto
temple
almost
side
by
side
at
last
a
pretty
young
woman
naked
to
the
waist
with
a
bosom
like
a
naiad
comes
running
down
the
street
to
the
hotel
at
a
surprising
speed
bowing
low
with
a
smile
as
she
hurries
by
us
into
the
house
this
little
person
is
the
of
the
inn
name
signifying
of
bliss
presently
she
reappears
at
the
threshold
fully
robed
in
a
nice
kimono
and
gracefully
invites
us
to
enter
which
we
are
only
too
glad
to
do
the
room
is
neat
and
spacious
shinto
kakemono
from
kitzuki
are
suspended
in
the
toko
and
upon
the
walls
and
in
one
corner
i
see
a
very
handsome
or
household
shrine
the
form
of
the
shrine
as
well
as
the
objects
of
worship
therein
vary
according
to
the
sect
of
the
worshippers
suddenly
i
become
aware
that
it
is
growing
strangely
dark
and
looking
about
me
perceive
that
all
the
doors
and
windows
and
other
apertures
of
the
inn
are
densely
blocked
up
by
a
silent
smiling
crowd
which
has
gathered
to
look
at
me
i
could
not
have
believed
there
were
so
many
people
in
in
a
japanese
house
during
the
hot
season
everything
is
thrown
open
to
the
breeze
all
the
shoji
or
sliding
which
serve
for
windows
and
all
the
opaque
fusuma
used
in
other
seasons
to
separate
apartments
are
removed
there
is
nothing
left
between
floor
and
roof
save
the
frame
or
skeleton
of
the
building
the
dwelling
is
literally
unwalled
and
may
be
seen
through
in
any
direction
the
landlord
finding
the
crowd
embarrassing
closes
up
the
building
in
front
the
silent
smiling
crowd
goes
to
the
rear
the
rear
is
also
closed
then
the
crowd
masses
to
right
and
left
of
the
house
and
both
sides
have
to
be
closed
which
makes
it
insufferably
hot
and
the
crowd
make
gentle
protest
wherefore
our
host
being
displeased
rebukes
the
multitude
with
argument
and
reason
yet
without
lifting
his
voice
never
do
these
people
lift
up
their
voices
in
anger
and
what
he
says
i
strive
to
translate
with
emphasis
as
follows
outrageousness
doing
what
marvellous
is
is
not
is
not
is
not
amusing
is
this
is
evil
matter
is
but
outside
soft
laughing
voices
continue
to
plead
pleading
shrewdly
enough
only
with
the
feminine
portion
of
the
family
the
heart
is
less
easily
touched
and
these
too
have
their
arguments
want
to
see
that
is
good
therefore
to
open
as
for
myself
i
would
gladly
protest
against
this
for
there
is
nothing
offensive
nor
even
embarrassing
in
the
gaze
of
these
innocent
gentle
people
but
as
the
landlord
seems
to
be
personally
annoyed
i
do
not
like
to
interfere
the
crowd
however
does
not
go
away
it
continues
to
increase
waiting
for
my
exit
and
there
is
one
high
window
in
the
rear
of
which
the
contain
some
holes
and
i
see
shadows
of
little
people
climbing
up
to
get
to
the
holes
presently
there
is
an
eye
at
every
hole
when
i
approach
the
window
the
peepers
drop
noiselessly
to
the
ground
with
little
timid
bursts
of
laughter
and
run
away
but
they
soon
come
back
again
a
more
charming
crowd
could
hardly
be
imagined
nearly
all
boys
and
girls
because
of
the
heat
but
fresh
and
clean
as
many
of
the
faces
are
surprisingly
pretty
there
are
but
very
few
which
are
not
extremely
pleasing
but
where
are
the
men
and
the
old
women
truly
this
population
seems
not
of
but
rather
of
the
the
boys
look
like
little
jizo
during
dinner
i
amuse
myself
by
poking
pears
and
little
pieces
of
radish
through
the
holes
in
the
shoji
at
first
there
is
much
hesitation
and
silvery
laughter
but
in
a
little
while
the
silhouette
of
a
tiny
hand
reaches
up
cautiously
and
a
pear
vanishes
away
then
a
second
pear
is
taken
without
snatching
as
softly
as
if
a
ghost
had
appropriated
it
thereafter
hesitation
ceases
despite
the
effort
of
one
elderly
woman
to
create
a
panic
by
crying
out
the
word
mahotsukai
by
the
time
the
dinner
is
over
and
the
shoji
removed
we
have
all
become
good
friends
then
the
crowd
resumes
its
silent
observation
from
the
four
cardinal
points
i
never
saw
a
more
striking
difference
in
the
appearance
of
two
village
populations
than
that
between
the
youth
of
and
of
kaka
yet
the
villages
are
but
two
hours
sailing
distance
apart
in
remoter
japan
as
in
certain
islands
of
the
west
indies
particular
physical
types
are
developed
apparently
among
communities
but
slightly
isolated
on
one
side
of
a
mountain
a
population
may
be
remarkably
attractive
while
upon
the
other
you
may
find
a
hamlet
whose
inhabitants
are
decidedly
unprepossessing
but
nowhere
in
this
country
have
i
seen
a
prettier
jeunesse
than
that
of
as
we
descend
to
the
bay
the
whole
of
including
even
the
ancients
of
the
village
accompanies
us
making
no
sound
except
the
pattering
of
geta
thus
we
are
escorted
to
our
boat
into
all
the
other
craft
drawn
up
on
the
beach
the
younger
folk
clamber
lightly
and
seat
themselves
on
the
prows
and
the
gunwales
to
gaze
at
the
marvellous
and
all
smile
but
say
nothing
even
to
each
other
somehow
the
experience
gives
me
the
sensation
of
being
asleep
it
is
so
soft
so
gentle
and
so
queer
withal
just
like
things
seen
in
dreams
and
as
we
glide
away
over
the
blue
lucent
water
i
look
back
to
see
the
people
all
waiting
and
gazing
still
from
the
great
semicircle
of
boats
all
the
slender
brown
dangling
from
the
prows
all
the
heads
motionless
in
the
sun
all
the
smiling
all
the
black
soft
eyes
still
watching
tirelessly
watching
the
and
as
the
scene
too
swiftly
receding
diminishes
to
the
width
of
a
kakemono
i
vainly
wish
that
i
could
buy
this
last
vision
of
it
to
place
it
in
my
toko
and
delight
my
soul
betimes
with
gazing
thereon
yet
another
moment
and
we
round
a
rocky
point
and
vanishes
from
my
sight
for
ever
so
all
things
pass
away
assuredly
those
impressions
which
longest
haunt
recollection
are
the
most
transitory
we
remember
many
more
instants
than
minutes
more
minutes
than
hours
and
who
remembers
an
entire
day
the
sum
of
the
remembered
happiness
of
a
lifetime
is
the
creation
of
seconds
is
more
fugitive
than
a
smile
yet
when
does
the
memory
of
a
vanished
smile
expire
or
the
soft
regret
which
that
memory
may
evoke
regret
for
a
single
individual
smile
is
something
common
to
normal
human
nature
but
regret
for
the
smile
of
a
population
for
a
smile
considered
as
an
abstract
quality
is
certainly
a
rare
sensation
and
one
to
be
obtained
i
fancy
only
in
this
orient
land
whose
people
smile
for
ever
like
their
own
gods
of
stone
and
this
precious
experience
is
already
mine
i
am
regretting
the
smile
of
kaka
simultaneously
there
comes
the
recollection
of
a
strangely
grim
buddhist
legend
once
the
buddha
smiled
and
by
the
wondrous
radiance
of
that
smile
were
countless
worlds
illuminated
but
there
came
a
voice
saying
is
not
real
it
can
not
last
and
the
light
passed
chapter
ten
at
mionoseki
seki
wa
yoi
toko
asahi
wo
ukete
arashiga
song
of
mionoseki
seki
is
a
goodly
place
facing
the
morning
sun
there
from
the
holy
mountains
the
winds
blow
softly
softly
soyosoyoto
sec
the
god
of
mionoseki
hates
eggs
hen
eggs
likewise
he
hates
hens
and
chickens
and
abhors
the
cock
above
all
living
creatures
and
in
mionoseki
there
are
no
cocks
or
hens
or
chickens
or
eggs
you
could
not
buy
a
hen
egg
in
that
place
even
for
twenty
times
its
weight
in
gold
and
no
boat
or
junk
or
steamer
could
be
hired
to
convey
to
mionoseki
so
much
as
the
feather
of
a
chicken
much
less
an
egg
indeed
it
is
even
held
that
if
you
have
eaten
eggs
in
the
morning
you
must
not
dare
to
visit
mionoseki
until
the
following
day
for
the
great
deity
of
mionoseki
is
the
patron
of
mariners
and
the
ruler
of
storms
and
woe
unto
the
vessel
which
bears
unto
his
shrine
even
the
odour
of
an
egg
once
the
tiny
steamer
which
runs
daily
from
matsue
to
mionoseki
encountered
some
unexpectedly
terrible
weather
on
her
outward
journey
just
after
reaching
the
open
sea
the
crew
insisted
that
something
displeasing
to
must
have
been
surreptitiously
brought
on
board
all
the
passengers
were
questioned
in
vain
suddenly
the
captain
discerned
upon
the
stem
of
a
little
brass
pipe
which
one
of
the
men
was
smoking
smoking
in
the
face
of
death
like
a
true
japanese
the
figure
of
a
crowing
cock
needless
to
say
that
pipe
was
thrown
overboard
then
the
angry
sea
began
to
grow
calm
and
the
little
vessel
safely
steamed
into
the
holy
port
and
cast
anchor
before
the
great
torii
of
the
shrine
of
the
god
sec
concerning
the
reason
why
the
cock
is
thus
detested
by
the
great
deity
of
mionoseki
and
banished
from
his
domain
divers
legends
are
told
but
the
substance
of
all
of
them
is
about
as
follows
as
we
read
in
the
kojiki
son
of
the
great
deity
of
kitsuki
was
wont
to
go
to
cape
miho
pursue
birds
and
catch
fish
and
for
other
reasons
also
he
used
to
absent
himself
from
home
at
night
but
had
always
to
return
before
dawn
now
in
those
days
the
cock
was
his
trusted
servant
charged
with
the
duty
of
crowing
lustily
when
it
was
time
for
the
god
to
return
but
one
morning
the
bird
failed
in
its
duty
and
the
god
hurrying
back
in
his
boat
lost
his
oars
and
had
to
paddle
with
his
hands
and
his
hands
were
bitten
by
the
wicked
fishes
now
the
people
of
yasugi
a
pretty
little
town
on
the
lagoon
of
through
which
we
pass
upon
our
way
to
mionoseki
most
devoutly
worship
the
same
and
nevertheless
in
yasugi
there
are
multitudes
of
cocks
and
hens
and
chickens
and
the
eggs
of
yasugi
can
not
be
excelled
for
size
and
quality
and
the
people
of
yasugi
aver
that
one
may
better
serve
the
deity
by
eating
eggs
than
by
doing
as
the
people
of
mionoseki
do
for
whenever
one
eats
a
chicken
or
devours
an
egg
one
destroys
an
enemy
of
sec
from
matsue
to
mionoseki
by
steamer
is
a
charming
journey
in
fair
weather
after
emerging
from
the
beautiful
lagoon
of
into
the
open
sea
the
little
packet
follows
the
long
coast
of
izumo
to
the
left
very
lofty
this
coast
is
all
cliffs
and
hills
rising
from
the
sea
mostly
green
to
their
summits
and
many
cultivated
in
terraces
so
as
to
look
like
green
pyramids
of
steps
the
bases
of
the
cliffs
are
very
rocky
and
the
curious
wrinklings
and
corrugations
of
the
coast
suggest
the
work
of
ancient
volcanic
forces
far
away
to
the
right
over
blue
still
leagues
of
sea
appears
the
long
low
shore
of
hoki
faint
as
a
mirage
with
its
far
beach
like
an
endless
white
streak
edging
the
blue
level
and
beyond
it
vapoury
lines
of
woods
and
cloudy
hills
and
over
everything
looming
into
the
high
sky
the
magnificent
ghostly
shape
of
daisen
at
its
summit
so
for
perhaps
an
hour
we
steam
on
between
hoki
and
izumo
the
rugged
and
broken
green
coast
on
our
left
occasionally
revealing
some
miniature
hamlet
sheltered
in
a
wrinkle
between
two
hills
the
phantom
coast
on
the
right
always
unchanged
then
suddenly
the
little
packet
whistles
heads
for
a
grim
promontory
to
port
glides
by
its
rocky
foot
and
enters
one
of
the
prettiest
little
bays
imaginable
previously
concealed
from
view
a
gap
in
the
coast
a
semicircular
basin
of
clear
deep
water
framed
in
by
high
corrugated
green
hills
all
around
the
edge
of
the
bay
the
quaintest
of
little
japanese
cities
mionoseki
there
is
no
beach
only
a
semicircle
of
stone
wharves
and
above
these
the
houses
and
above
these
the
beautiful
green
of
the
sacred
hills
with
a
temple
roof
or
two
showing
an
angle
through
the
foliage
from
the
rear
of
each
house
steps
descend
to
deep
water
and
boats
are
moored
at
all
the
we
moor
in
front
of
the
great
temple
the
miojinja
its
great
paved
avenue
slopes
to
the
water
edge
where
boats
are
also
moored
at
steps
of
stone
and
looking
up
the
broad
approach
one
sees
a
grand
stone
torii
and
colossal
stone
lanterns
and
two
magnificent
sculptured
lions
karashishi
seated
upon
lofty
pedestals
and
looking
down
upon
the
people
from
a
height
of
fifteen
feet
or
more
beyond
all
this
the
walls
and
gate
of
the
outer
temple
court
appear
and
beyond
them
the
roofs
of
the
great
haiden
and
the
pierced
projecting
of
the
loftier
the
holy
shrine
itself
relieved
against
the
green
of
the
wooded
hills
picturesque
junks
are
lying
in
ranks
at
anchor
there
are
two
vessels
likewise
of
modern
build
ships
from
osaka
and
there
is
a
most
romantic
little
breakwater
built
of
hewn
stone
with
a
stone
lantern
perched
at
the
end
of
it
and
there
is
a
pretty
humped
bridge
connecting
it
with
a
tiny
island
on
which
i
see
a
shrine
of
benten
the
goddess
of
waters
i
wonder
if
i
shall
be
able
to
get
any
eggs
sec
unto
the
pretty
waiting
maiden
of
the
inn
shimaya
i
put
this
scandalous
question
with
an
innocent
face
but
a
remorseful
heart
ne
tamago
wa
arimasenka
with
the
smile
of
a
kwannon
she
makes
reply
sukoshi
gozarimasu
delicious
surprise
there
augustly
exist
eggs
of
ducks
but
there
exist
no
ducks
for
ducks
could
not
find
life
worth
living
in
a
city
where
there
is
only
water
and
all
the
ducks
eggs
come
from
sakai
sec
this
pretty
little
hotel
whose
upper
chambers
overlook
the
water
is
situated
at
one
end
or
nearly
at
one
end
of
the
crescent
of
mionoseki
and
the
miojinja
almost
at
the
other
so
that
one
must
walk
through
the
whole
town
to
visit
the
temple
or
else
cross
the
harbour
by
boat
but
the
whole
town
is
well
worth
seeing
it
is
so
tightly
pressed
between
the
sea
and
the
bases
of
the
hills
that
there
is
only
room
for
one
real
street
and
this
is
so
narrow
that
a
man
could
anywhere
jump
from
the
second
story
of
a
house
upon
the
into
the
second
story
of
the
opposite
house
upon
the
and
it
is
as
picturesque
as
it
is
narrow
with
its
awnings
and
polished
balconies
and
fluttering
figured
draperies
from
this
main
street
several
little
ruelles
slope
to
the
water
edge
where
they
terminate
in
steps
and
in
all
these
miniature
alleys
long
boats
are
lying
with
their
prows
projecting
over
the
edge
of
the
wharves
as
if
eager
to
plunge
in
the
temptation
to
take
to
the
water
i
find
to
be
irresistible
before
visiting
the
miojinja
i
jump
from
the
rear
of
our
hotel
into
twelve
feet
of
limpid
sea
and
cool
myself
by
a
swim
across
the
harbour
on
the
way
to
miojinja
i
notice
in
multitudes
of
little
shops
fascinating
displays
of
baskets
and
utensils
made
of
woven
bamboo
fine
is
indeed
the
meibutsu
the
special
product
of
mionoseki
and
almost
every
visitor
buys
some
nice
little
specimen
to
carry
home
with
him
the
miojinja
is
not
in
its
architecture
more
remarkable
than
ordinary
shinto
temples
in
izumo
nor
are
its
interior
decorations
worth
describing
in
detail
only
the
approach
to
it
over
the
broad
sloping
space
of
level
pavement
under
the
granite
torii
and
between
the
great
lions
and
lamps
of
stone
is
noble
within
the
courts
proper
there
is
not
much
to
be
seen
except
a
magnificent
tank
of
solid
bronze
weighing
tons
which
must
have
cost
many
thousands
of
yen
it
is
a
votive
offering
of
more
humble
there
is
a
queer
collection
in
the
shamusho
or
business
building
on
the
right
of
the
haiden
a
series
of
quaintly
designed
and
quaintly
coloured
pictures
representing
ships
in
great
storms
being
guided
or
aided
to
port
by
the
power
of
these
are
gifts
from
ships
the
ofuda
are
not
so
curious
as
those
of
other
famous
izumo
temples
but
they
are
most
eagerly
sought
for
those
strips
of
white
paper
bearing
the
deity
name
and
a
few
words
of
promise
which
are
sold
for
a
few
rin
are
tied
to
rods
of
bamboo
and
planted
in
all
the
fields
of
the
country
roundabout
the
most
curious
things
sold
are
tiny
packages
of
it
is
alleged
that
whatever
you
desire
will
grow
from
these
if
you
plant
them
uttering
a
prayer
if
you
desire
bamboos
peas
or
watermelons
it
matters
not
only
plant
the
seed
and
believe
and
the
desired
crop
will
arise
sec
much
more
interesting
to
me
than
the
ofuda
of
the
miojinja
are
the
yoraku
the
pendent
in
the
hojinji
a
temple
of
the
zen
sect
which
stands
on
the
summit
of
the
beautiful
hill
above
the
great
shinto
shrine
before
an
altar
on
which
are
ranged
the
images
of
the
kwannons
the
forms
of
that
goddess
of
mercy
who
represents
the
ideal
of
all
that
is
sweet
and
pure
in
the
japanese
maiden
a
strange
brightly
coloured
mass
of
curious
things
may
be
seen
suspended
from
the
carven
ceiling
there
are
hundreds
of
balls
of
worsted
and
balls
of
cotton
thread
of
all
colours
there
are
skeins
of
silk
and
patterns
of
silk
weaving
and
of
cotton
weaving
there
are
broidered
purses
in
the
shape
of
sparrows
and
other
living
creatures
there
are
samples
of
bamboo
plaiting
and
countless
specimens
of
needlework
all
these
are
the
votive
offerings
of
school
children
little
girls
only
to
the
of
all
grace
and
sweetness
and
pity
so
soon
as
a
baby
girl
learns
something
in
the
way
of
work
sewing
or
weaving
or
knitting
or
broidering
she
brings
her
first
successful
effort
to
the
temple
as
an
offering
to
the
gentle
divinity
eyes
are
beautiful
she
looketh
down
above
the
sound
of
prayer
even
the
infants
of
the
japanese
kindergarten
bring
their
first
work
here
pretty
scissored
out
and
plaited
into
divers
patterns
by
their
own
tiny
hands
sec
very
sleepy
and
quiet
by
day
is
mionoseki
only
at
long
intervals
one
hears
laughter
of
children
or
the
chant
of
oarsmen
rowing
the
most
extraordinary
boats
i
ever
saw
outside
of
the
tropics
boats
heavy
as
barges
which
require
ten
men
to
move
them
these
stand
naked
to
the
work
wielding
oars
with
imagine
a
letter
t
with
the
lower
end
lengthened
out
into
an
and
at
every
pull
they
push
their
feet
against
the
gunwales
to
give
more
force
to
the
stroke
intoning
in
every
pause
a
strange
refrain
of
which
the
soft
melancholy
calls
back
to
me
certain
old
spanish
creole
melodies
heard
in
west
indian
waters
ghi
ghi
the
chant
begins
with
a
long
high
note
and
descends
by
fractional
tones
with
almost
every
syllable
and
faints
away
a
last
into
an
almost
indistinguishable
hum
then
comes
the
stroke
ghi
but
at
night
mionoseki
is
one
of
the
noisiest
and
merriest
little
havens
of
western
japan
from
one
horn
of
its
crescent
to
the
other
the
fires
of
the
shokudai
which
are
the
tall
light
of
banquets
mirror
themselves
in
the
water
and
the
whole
air
palpitates
with
sounds
of
revelry
everywhere
one
hears
the
booming
of
the
tsudzumi
the
little
of
the
geisha
and
sweet
plaintive
chants
of
girls
and
tinkling
of
samisen
and
the
measured
clapping
of
hands
in
the
dance
and
the
wild
cries
and
laughter
of
the
players
at
ken
and
all
these
are
but
echoes
of
the
diversions
of
sailors
verily
the
nature
of
sailors
differs
but
little
the
world
over
every
good
ship
which
visits
mionoseki
leaves
there
so
i
am
assured
from
three
hundred
to
five
hundred
yen
for
sake
and
for
much
do
these
mariners
pray
the
great
deity
who
hates
eggs
to
make
calm
the
waters
and
favourable
the
winds
so
that
mionoseki
may
be
reached
in
good
time
without
harm
but
having
come
hither
over
an
unruffled
sea
with
fair
soft
breezes
all
the
way
small
indeed
is
the
gift
which
they
give
to
the
temple
of
the
god
and
marvellously
large
the
sums
which
they
pay
unto
geisha
and
keepers
of
taverns
but
the
god
is
patient
and
except
in
the
matter
of
eggs
however
these
japanese
seamen
are
very
gentle
compared
with
our
own
jack
tars
and
not
without
a
certain
refinement
and
politeness
of
their
own
i
see
them
sitting
naked
to
the
waist
at
their
banquets
for
it
is
very
hot
but
they
use
their
chopsticks
as
daintily
and
pledge
each
other
in
sake
almost
as
graciously
as
men
of
a
better
class
likewise
they
seem
to
treat
their
girls
very
kindly
it
is
quite
pleasant
to
watch
them
feasting
across
the
street
perhaps
their
laughter
is
somewhat
more
boisterous
and
their
gesticulation
a
little
more
vehement
than
those
of
the
common
citizens
but
there
is
nothing
resembling
real
roughness
much
less
rudeness
all
become
motionless
and
silent
as
statues
fifteen
fine
bronzes
ranged
along
the
wall
of
the
zashiki
when
some
pretty
geisha
begins
one
of
those
histrionic
dances
which
to
the
western
stranger
seem
at
first
mysterious
as
a
performance
of
witchcraft
but
which
really
are
charming
translations
of
legend
and
story
into
the
language
of
living
grace
and
the
poetry
of
woman
smile
and
as
the
wine
flows
the
more
urbane
becomes
the
merriment
until
there
falls
upon
all
that
pleasant
sleepiness
which
sake
brings
and
the
guests
one
by
one
smilingly
depart
nothing
could
be
happier
or
gentler
than
their
evening
joviality
yet
sailors
are
considered
in
japan
an
especially
rough
class
what
would
be
thought
of
our
own
roughs
in
such
a
country
well
i
have
been
fourteen
months
in
izumo
and
i
have
not
yet
heard
voices
raised
in
anger
or
witnessed
a
quarrel
never
have
i
seen
one
man
strike
another
or
a
woman
bullied
or
a
child
slapped
indeed
i
have
never
seen
any
real
roughness
anywhere
that
i
have
been
in
japan
except
at
the
open
ports
where
the
poorer
classes
seem
through
contact
with
europeans
to
lose
their
natural
politeness
their
native
morals
even
their
capacity
for
simple
happiness
sec
last
night
i
saw
the
seamen
of
old
japan
i
shall
see
those
of
new
japan
an
apparition
in
the
offing
has
filled
all
this
little
port
with
excitement
an
imperial
everybody
is
going
out
to
look
at
her
and
all
the
long
boats
that
were
lying
in
the
alleys
are
already
hastening
full
of
curious
folk
to
the
steel
colossus
a
cruiser
of
the
first
class
with
a
crew
of
five
hundred
i
take
passage
in
one
of
those
astounding
craft
i
mentioned
before
a
sort
of
barge
propelled
by
ten
exceedingly
strong
naked
men
wielding
enormous
oars
or
rather
sweeps
with
but
i
do
not
go
alone
indeed
i
can
scarcely
find
room
to
stand
so
crowded
the
boat
is
with
passengers
of
all
ages
especially
women
who
are
nervous
about
going
to
sea
in
an
ordinary
sampan
and
a
jumps
into
the
crowd
at
the
risk
of
her
life
just
as
we
push
off
and
burns
her
arm
against
my
cigar
in
the
jump
i
am
very
sorry
for
her
but
she
laughs
merrily
at
my
solicitude
and
the
rowers
begin
their
melancholy
somnolent
song
ghi
ghi
it
is
a
long
pull
to
reach
her
the
beautiful
monster
towering
motionless
there
in
the
summer
sea
with
scarce
a
curling
of
thin
smoke
from
the
mighty
lungs
of
her
slumbering
engines
and
that
somnolent
song
of
our
boatmen
must
surely
have
some
ancient
magic
in
it
for
by
the
time
we
glide
alongside
i
feel
as
if
i
were
looking
at
a
dream
strange
as
a
vision
of
sleep
indeed
this
spectacle
the
host
of
quaint
craft
hovering
and
trembling
around
that
tremendous
bulk
and
all
the
multitude
of
the
antique
port
men
women
children
the
grey
and
the
young
together
crawling
up
those
mighty
flanks
in
one
ceaseless
stream
like
a
swarming
of
ants
and
all
this
with
a
great
humming
like
the
humming
of
a
hive
a
sound
made
up
of
low
laughter
and
chattering
in
undertones
and
subdued
murmurs
of
amazement
for
the
colossus
overawes
them
this
ship
of
the
the
son
of
heaven
and
they
wonder
like
babies
at
the
walls
and
the
turrets
of
steel
and
the
giant
guns
and
the
mighty
chains
and
the
stern
bearing
of
the
hundreds
looking
down
upon
the
scene
without
a
smile
over
the
iron
bulwarks
japanese
those
also
yet
changed
by
some
mysterious
process
into
the
semblance
of
strangers
only
the
experienced
eye
could
readily
decide
the
nationality
of
those
stalwart
marines
but
for
the
sight
of
the
imperial
arms
in
gold
and
the
glimmering
ideographs
upon
the
stern
one
might
well
suppose
self
gazing
at
some
spanish
or
italian
manned
by
brown
latin
men
i
can
not
possibly
get
on
board
the
iron
steps
are
occupied
by
an
endless
chain
of
clinging
bodies
boys
from
school
and
old
men
with
grey
queues
and
fearless
young
mothers
holding
fast
to
the
ropes
with
babies
strapped
to
their
backs
and
peasants
and
fishers
and
they
are
now
simply
sticking
there
like
flies
somebody
has
told
them
they
must
wait
fifteen
minutes
so
they
wait
with
smiling
patience
and
behind
them
in
the
fleet
of
boats
hundreds
more
wait
and
wonder
but
they
do
not
wait
for
fifteen
minutes
all
hopes
are
suddenly
shattered
by
a
stentorian
announcement
from
the
deck
jikan

the
monster
is
getting
up

going

nobody
else

and
from
the
patient
swarm
of
clingers
to
the
and
the
patient
waiters
in
the
fleet
of
boats
there
goes
up
one
exceedingly
plaintive
and
prolonged
of
disappointment
followed
by
artless
reproaches

apparently
the
gunjin
are
accustomed
to
such
scenes
for
they
do
not
even
smile
but
we
linger
near
the
cruiser
to
watch
the
hurried
descent
of
the
sightseers
into
their
boats
and
the
slow
ponderous
motion
of
the
ascending
and
the
swarming
of
sailors
down
over
the
bows
to
fasten
and
unfasten
mysterious
things
one
bending
drops
his
white
cap
and
there
is
a
race
of
boats
for
the
honour
of
picking
it
up
a

it

me
from

then
there
are
loud
cries
of

the

were
to
move
now
there
would
be
swamping
and
crushing
and
drowning
unspeakable
all
the
little
boats
scatter
and
flee
away
our
ten
naked
oarsmen
once
more
bend
to
their
oars
and
recommence
their
ancient
melancholy
song
and
as
we
glide
back
there
comes
to
me
the
idea
of
the
prodigious
cost
of
that
which
we
went
forth
to
see
the
magnificent
horror
of
steel
and
steam
and
all
the
multiple
enginery
of
death
paid
for
by
those
humble
millions
who
toil
for
ever
in
the
slime

never

cheaper
must
be

live
upon

nevertheless
merely
to
protect
the
little
that
they
own
such
nightmares
must
be
called
into
existence

how

now
seems
drowsing

only
the

just

is
no
longer
with
me
he
has
gone
to
kyoto
the
holy
buddhist
city
to
edit
a
buddhist
magazine
and
i
already
feel
without
him
like
one
who
has
lost
his
way
despite
his
reiterated
assurances
that
he
could
never
be
of
much
service
to
me
in
izumo
as
he
knew
nothing
about
shinto
but
for
the
time
being
i
am
to
have
plenty
of
company
at
kitzuki
where
i
am
spending
the
first
part
of
the
summer
holidays
for
the
little
city
is
full
of
students
and
teachers
who
know
me
kitzuki
is
not
only
the
holiest
place
in
the
it
is
also
the
most
fashionable
bathing
resort
the
beach
at
inasa
bay
is
one
of
the
best
in
all
japan
the
beach
hotels
are
spacious
airy
and
comfortable
and
the
bathing
houses
with
hot
and
cold
freshwater
baths
in
which
to
wash
off
the
brine
after
a
swim
are
simply
faultless
and
in
fair
weather
the
scenery
is
delightful
as
you
look
out
over
the
summer
space
of
sea
closing
the
bay
on
the
right
there
reaches
out
from
the
hills
overshadowing
the
town
a
mighty
rugged
spur
the
kitzuki
promontory
on
the
left
a
low
long
range
of
mountains
serrate
the
horizon
beyond
the

one
huge
vapoury
shape
towering
blue
into
the
blue
sky
behind
them
the
truncated
silhouette
of
sanbeyama
before
you
the
japanese
sea
touches
the
sky
and
there
upon
still
clear
nights
there
appears
a
horizon
of
fire
the
torches
of
hosts
of
riding
at
anchor
three
and
four
miles
away
so
numerous
that
their
lights
seem
to
the
naked
eye
a
band
of
unbroken
flame
the
guji
has
invited
me
and
one
of
my
friends
to
see
a
great
harvest
dance
at
his
residence
on
the
evening
of
the
festival
of
tenjin
this
dance
is
peculiar
to
izumo
and
the
opportunity
to
witness
it
in
this
city
is
a
rare
one
as
it
is
going
to
be
performed
only
by
order
of
the
guji
the
robust
pontiff
himself
loves
the
sea
quite
as
much
as
anyone
in
kitzuki
yet
he
never
enters
a
beach
hotel
much
less
a
public
bathing
house
for
his
use
alone
a
special
bathing
house
has
been
built
upon
a
ledge
of
the
cliff
overhanging
the
little
settlement
of
inasa
it
is
approached
by
a
narrow
pathway
shadowed
by
and
there
is
a
torii
before
it
and
shimenawa
to
this
little
house
the
guji
ascends
daily
during
the
bathing
season
accompanied
by
a
single
attendant
who
prepares
his
bathing
dresses
and
spreads
the
clean
mats
upon
which
he
rests
after
returning
from
the
sea
the
guji
always
bathes
robed
no
one
but
himself
and
his
servant
ever
approaches
the
little
house
which
commands
a
charming
view
of
the
bay
public
reverence
for
the
person
has
made
even
his
holy
ground
as
for
the
they
still
worship
him
with
hearts
and
bodies
they
have
ceased
to
believe
as
they
did
in
former
times
that
anyone
upon
whom
the
kokuzo
fixes
his
eye
at
once
becomes
unable
to
speak
or
move
but
when
he
passes
among
them
through
the
temple
court
they
still
prostrate
themselves
along
his
way
as
before
the
ikigami
kitzuki
july
always
through
the
memory
of
my
first
day
at
kitzuki
there
will
pass
the
beautiful
white
apparition
of
the
miko
with
her
perfect
passionless
face
and
strange
gracious
soundless
tread
as
of
a
ghost
her
name
signifies
pet
or
darling
of
the
gods
the
kind
guji
at
my
earnest
request
procured
me
or
rather
had
taken
for
me
a
photograph
of
the
miko
in
the
attitude
of
her
dance
upholding
the
mystic
suzu
and
wearing
over
her
crimson
hakama
the
snowy
descending
to
her
feet
and
the
learned
priest
sasa
told
me
these
things
concerning
the
pet
of
the
gods
and
the
which
is
the
name
of
her
sacred
dance
contrary
to
the
custom
at
the
other
great
shinto
temples
of
japan
such
as
ise
the
office
of
miko
at
kitzuki
has
always
been
hereditary
formerly
there
were
in
kitzuki
more
than
thirty
families
whose
daughters
served
the
as
miko
there
are
but
two
and
the
number
of
virgin
priestesses
does
not
exceed
six
the
one
whose
portrait
i
obtained
being
the
chief
at
ise
and
elsewhere
the
daughter
of
any
shinto
priest
may
become
a
miko
but
she
can
not
serve
in
that
capacity
after
becoming
nubile
so
that
except
in
kitzuki
the
miko
of
all
the
greater
temples
are
children
from
ten
to
twelve
years
of
age
but
at
the
kitzuki
the
are
beautiful
girls
of
between
sixteen
and
nineteen
years
of
age
and
sometimes
a
favourite
miko
is
allowed
to
continue
to
serve
the
gods
even
after
having
been
married
the
sacred
dance
is
not
difficult
to
learn
the
mother
or
sister
teaches
it
to
the
child
destined
to
serve
in
the
temple
the
miko
lives
at
home
and
visits
the
temple
only
upon
festival
days
to
perform
her
duties
she
is
not
placed
under
any
severe
discipline
or
restrictions
she
takes
no
special
vows
she
risks
no
dreadful
penalties
for
ceasing
to
remain
a
virgin
but
her
position
being
one
of
high
honour
and
a
source
of
revenue
to
her
family
the
ties
which
bind
her
to
duty
are
scarcely
less
cogent
than
those
vows
taken
by
the
priestesses
of
the
antique
occident
like
the
priestesses
of
delphi
the
miko
was
in
ancient
times
also
a
divineress
a
living
oracle
uttering
the
secrets
of
the
future
when
possessed
by
the
god
whom
she
served
at
no
temple
does
the
miko
now
act
as
sibyl
oracular
priestess
or
divineress
but
there
still
exists
a
class
of
who
claim
to
hold
communication
with
the
dead
and
to
foretell
the
future
and
who
call
themselves
miko
practising
their
profession
secretly
for
it
has
been
prohibited
by
law
in
the
various
great
shinto
shrines
of
the
empire
the
mikokagura
is
differently
danced
in
kitzuki
most
ancient
of
all
the
dance
is
the
most
simple
and
the
most
primitive
its
purpose
being
to
give
pleasure
to
the
gods
religious
conservatism
has
preserved
its
traditions
and
steps
unchanged
since
the
period
of
the
beginning
of
the
faith
the
origin
of
this
dance
is
to
be
found
in
the
kojiki
legend
of
the
dance
of
she
by
whose
mirth
and
song
the
was
lured
from
the
cavern
into
which
she
had
retired
and
brought
back
to
illuminate
the
world
and
the
suzu
the
strange
bronze
instrument
with
its
cluster
of
bells
which
the
miko
uses
in
her
dance
still
preserves
the
form
of
that
to
which
fastened
small
bells
with
grass
ere
beginning
her
mirthful
song
sec
behind
the
library
in
the
rear
of
the
great
shrine
there
stands
a
more
ancient
structure
which
is
still
called
the
or
of
the
miko
here
in
former
times
all
the
were
obliged
to
live
under
a
somewhat
stricter
discipline
than
now
by
day
they
could
go
out
where
they
pleased
but
they
were
under
obligation
to
return
at
night
to
the
yashiki
before
the
gates
of
the
court
were
closed
for
it
was
feared
that
the
pets
of
the
gods
might
so
far
forget
themselves
as
to
condescend
to
become
the
darlings
of
adventurous
mortals
nor
was
the
fear
at
all
unreasonable
for
it
was
the
duty
of
a
miko
to
be
singularly
innocent
as
well
as
beautiful
and
one
of
the
most
beautiful
miko
who
belonged
to
the
service
of
the
did
actually
so
fall
from
grace
giving
to
the
japanese
world
a
romance
which
you
can
buy
in
cheap
printed
form
at
any
large
bookstore
in
japan
her
name
was
and
she
was
the
daughter
of
one
nakamura
mongoro
of
kitzuki
where
her
descendants
still
live
at
the
present
day
while
serving
as
dancer
in
the
great
temple
she
fell
in
love
with
a
ronin
named
nagoya
sanza
a
desperate
handsome
vagabond
with
no
fortune
in
the
world
but
his
sword
and
she
left
the
temple
secretly
and
fled
away
with
her
lover
toward
kyoto
all
this
must
have
happened
not
less
than
three
hundred
years
ago
on
their
way
to
kyoto
they
met
another
ronin
whose
real
name
i
have
not
been
able
to
learn
for
a
moment
only
this
figures
in
the
story
and
immediately
vanishes
into
the
eternal
night
of
death
and
all
forgotten
things
it
is
simply
recorded
that
he
desired
permission
to
travel
with
them
that
he
became
enamoured
of
the
beautiful
miko
and
excited
the
jealousy
of
her
lover
to
such
an
extent
that
a
desperate
duel
was
the
result
in
which
sanza
slew
his
rival
thereafter
the
fugitives
pursued
their
way
to
kyoto
without
other
interruption
whether
the
fair
had
by
this
time
found
ample
reason
to
regret
the
step
she
had
taken
we
can
not
know
but
from
the
story
of
her
it
would
seem
that
the
face
of
the
handsome
ronin
who
had
perished
through
his
passion
for
her
became
a
haunting
memory
we
next
hear
of
her
in
a
strange
role
at
kyoto
her
lover
appears
to
have
been
utterly
destitute
for
in
order
to
support
him
we
find
her
giving
exhibitions
of
the
in
the
which
is
the
name
given
to
a
portion
of
the
dry
bed
of
the
river
kamagawa
doubtless
the
same
place
in
which
the
terrible
executions
by
torture
took
place
she
must
have
been
looked
upon
by
the
public
of
that
day
as
an
outcast
but
her
extraordinary
beauty
seems
to
have
attracted
many
spectators
and
to
have
proved
more
than
successful
as
an
exhibition
sanza
purse
became
well
filled
yet
the
dance
of
in
the
was
nothing
more
than
the
same
dance
which
the
miko
of
kitzuki
dance
in
their
crimson
hakama
and
snowy
robes
a
graceful
gliding
walk
the
pair
next
appear
in
tokyo
or
as
it
was
then
called
yedo
as
actors
indeed
is
universally
credited
by
tradition
with
having
established
the
modern
japanese
stage
the
first
profane
drama
before
her
time
only
religious
plays
of
buddhist
authorship
seem
to
have
been
known
sanza
himself
became
a
popular
and
successful
actor
under
his
sweetheart
tuition
he
had
many
famous
pupils
among
them
the
great
saruwaka
who
subsequently
founded
a
theatre
in
yedo
and
the
theatre
called
after
him
saruwakaza
in
the
street
saruwakacho
remains
even
unto
this
day
but
since
the
time
of
women
have
been
at
least
until
very
recently
excluded
from
the
japanese
stage
their
parts
as
among
the
old
greeks
being
taken
by
men
or
boys
so
effeminate
in
appearance
and
so
skilful
in
acting
that
the
keenest
observer
could
never
detect
their
sex
nagoya
sanza
died
many
years
before
his
companion
then
returned
to
her
native
place
to
ancient
kitzuki
where
she
cut
off
her
beautiful
hair
and
became
a
buddhist
nun
she
was
learned
for
her
century
and
especially
skilful
in
that
art
of
poetry
called
renga
and
this
art
she
continued
to
teach
until
her
death
with
the
small
fortune
she
had
earned
as
an
actress
she
built
in
kitzuki
the
little
buddhist
temple
called
rengaji
in
the
very
heart
of
the
quaint
town
so
called
because
there
she
taught
the
art
of
renga
now
the
reason
she
built
the
temple
was
that
she
might
therein
always
pray
for
the
soul
of
the
man
whom
the
sight
of
her
beauty
had
ruined
and
whose
smile
perhaps
had
stirred
something
within
her
heart
whereof
sanza
never
knew
her
family
enjoyed
certain
privileges
for
several
centuries
because
she
had
founded
the
whole
art
of
the
japanese
stage
and
until
so
recently
as
the
restoration
the
chief
of
the
descendants
of
nakamura
mongoro
was
always
entitled
to
a
share
in
the
profits
of
the
kitzuki
theatre
and
enjoyed
the
title
of
zamoto
the
family
is
now
however
very
poor
i
went
to
see
the
little
temple
of
rengaji
and
found
that
it
had
disappeared
until
within
a
few
years
it
used
to
stand
at
the
foot
of
the
great
flight
of
stone
steps
leading
to
the
second
kwannondera
the
most
imposing
temple
of
kwannon
in
kitzuki
nothing
now
remains
of
the
rengaji
but
a
broken
statue
of
jizo
before
which
the
people
still
pray
the
former
court
of
the
little
temple
has
been
turned
into
a
vegetable
garden
and
the
material
of
the
ancient
building
utilised
irreverently
enough
for
the
construction
of
some
petty
cottages
now
occupying
its
site
a
peasant
told
me
that
the
kakemono
and
other
sacred
objects
had
been
given
to
the
neighbouring
temple
where
they
might
be
seen
sec
not
far
from
the
site
of
the
rengaji
in
the
grounds
of
the
great
hakaba
of
the
kwannondera
there
stands
a
most
curious
pine
the
trunk
of
the
tree
is
supported
not
on
the
ground
but
upon
four
colossal
roots
which
lift
it
up
at
such
an
angle
that
it
looks
like
a
thing
walking
upon
four
legs
trees
of
singular
shape
are
often
considered
to
be
the
of
kami
and
the
pine
in
question
affords
an
example
of
this
belief
a
fence
has
been
built
around
it
and
a
small
shrine
placed
before
it
prefaced
by
several
small
torii
and
many
poor
people
may
be
seen
at
almost
any
hour
of
the
day
praying
to
the
kami
of
the
place
before
the
little
shrine
i
notice
besides
the
usual
kitzuki
of
seaweed
several
little
effigies
of
horses
made
of
straw
why
these
offerings
of
horses
of
straw
it
appears
that
the
shrine
is
dedicated
to
koshin
the
lord
of
roads
and
those
who
are
anxious
about
the
health
of
their
horses
pray
to
the
to
preserve
their
animals
from
sickness
and
death
at
the
same
time
bringing
these
straw
effigies
in
token
of
their
desire
but
this
role
of
veterinarian
is
not
commonly
attributed
to
koshin
and
it
appears
that
something
in
the
fantastic
form
of
the
tree
suggested
the
idea
sec
kitzuki
july
within
the
first
court
of
the
and
to
the
left
of
the
chief
gate
stands
a
small
timber
structure
with
age
shaped
like
a
common
miya
or
shrine
to
the
wooden
gratings
of
its
closed
doors
are
knotted
many
of
those
white
papers
upon
which
are
usually
written
vows
or
prayers
to
the
gods
but
on
peering
through
the
grating
one
sees
no
shinto
symbols
in
the
dimness
within
it
is
a
stable
and
there
in
the
central
stall
is
a
superb
horse
looking
at
you
japanese
horseshoes
of
straw
are
suspended
to
the
wall
behind
him
he
does
not
move
he
is
made
of
bronze
upon
inquiring
of
the
learned
priest
sasa
the
story
of
this
horse
i
was
told
the
following
curious
things
on
the
eleventh
day
of
the
seventh
month
by
the
ancient
calendar
falls
the
strange
festival
called
minige
or
upon
that
day
is
said
that
the
great
deity
of
kitzuki
leaves
his
shrine
to
pass
through
all
the
streets
of
the
city
and
along
the
seashore
after
which
he
enters
into
the
house
of
the
kokuzo
wherefore
upon
that
day
the
kokuzo
was
always
wont
to
leave
his
house
and
at
the
present
time
though
he
does
not
actually
abandon
his
home
he
and
his
family
retire
into
certain
apartments
so
as
to
leave
the
larger
part
of
the
dwelling
free
for
the
use
of
the
god
this
retreat
of
the
kokuzo
is
still
called
the
minige
now
while
the
great
deity
is
passing
through
the
streets
he
is
followed
by
the
highest
shinto
priest
of
the
shrine
this
kannushi
having
been
formerly
called
bekkwa
the
word
means
or
fire
and
the
chief
kannushi
was
so
called
because
for
a
week
before
the
festival
he
had
been
nourished
only
with
special
food
cooked
with
the
sacred
fire
so
that
he
might
be
pure
in
the
presence
of
the
god
and
the
office
of
bekkwa
was
hereditary
and
the
appellation
at
last
became
a
family
name
but
he
who
performs
the
rite
is
no
longer
called
bekkwa
now
while
performing
his
function
if
the
bekkwa
met
anyone
upon
the
street
he
ordered
him
to
stand
aside
with
the
words
give
way
and
the
common
people
believed
and
still
believe
that
anybody
thus
spoken
to
by
the
officiating
kannushi
would
be
changed
into
a
dog
so
on
that
day
of
the
minige
nobody
used
to
go
out
into
the
streets
after
a
certain
hour
and
even
now
very
few
of
the
people
of
the
little
city
leave
their
homes
during
the
festival
after
having
followed
the
deity
through
all
the
city
the
bekkwa
used
to
perform
between
two
and
three
in
the
darkness
of
the
morning
some
secret
rite
by
the
seaside
i
am
told
this
rite
is
still
annually
performed
at
the
same
hour
but
except
the
bekkwa
himself
no
man
might
be
present
and
it
was
believed
and
is
still
believed
by
the
common
people
that
were
any
man
by
mischance
to
see
the
rite
he
would
instantly
fall
dead
or
become
transformed
into
an
animal
so
sacred
was
the
secret
of
that
rite
that
the
bekkwa
could
not
even
utter
it
until
after
he
was
dead
to
his
successor
in
office
therefore
when
he
died
the
body
was
laid
upon
the
matting
of
a
certain
inner
chamber
of
the
temple
and
the
son
was
left
alone
with
the
corpse
after
all
the
doors
had
been
carefully
closed
then
at
a
certain
hour
of
the
night
the
soul
returned
into
the
body
of
the
dead
priest
and
he
lifted
himself
up
and
whispered
the
awful
secret
into
the
ear
of
his
son
and
fell
back
dead
again
but
what
you
may
ask
has
all
this
to
do
with
the
horse
of
bronze
only
this
upon
the
festival
of
the
minige
the
great
deity
of
kitzuki
rides
through
the
streets
of
his
city
upon
the
horse
of
bronze
sec
the
horse
of
bronze
however
is
far
from
being
the
only
statue
in
izumo
which
is
believed
to
run
about
occasionally
at
night
at
least
a
score
of
other
artistic
things
are
or
have
been
credited
with
similar
ghastly
inclinations
the
great
carven
dragon
which
writhes
above
the
entrance
of
the
kitzuki
haiden
used
i
am
told
to
crawl
about
the
roofs
at
night
until
a
carpenter
was
summoned
to
cut
its
wooden
throat
with
a
chisel
after
which
it
ceased
its
perambulations
you
can
see
for
yourself
the
mark
of
the
chisel
on
its
throat
at
the
splendid
shinto
temple
of
kasuga
in
matsue
there
are
two
pretty
bronze
deer
stag
and
doe
the
heads
of
which
seemed
to
me
to
have
been
separately
cast
and
subsequently
riveted
very
deftly
to
the
bodies
nevertheless
i
have
been
assured
by
some
good
that
each
figure
was
originally
a
single
casting
but
that
it
was
afterwards
found
necessary
to
cut
off
the
heads
of
the
deer
to
make
them
keep
quiet
at
night
but
the
most
unpleasant
customer
of
all
this
uncanny
fraternity
to
have
encountered
after
dark
was
certainly
the
monster
tortoise
of
gesshoji
temple
in
matsue
where
the
tombs
of
the
matsudairas
are
this
stone
colossus
is
almost
seventeen
feet
in
length
and
lifts
its
head
six
feet
from
the
ground
on
its
now
broken
back
stands
a
prodigious
cubic
monolith
about
nine
feet
high
bearing
a
inscription
fancy
as
izumo
folks
did
this
mortuary
incubus
staggering
abroad
at
midnight
and
its
hideous
attempts
to
swim
in
the
neighbouring
pond
well
the
legend
runs
that
its
neck
had
to
be
broken
in
consequence
of
this
awful
misbehaviour
but
really
the
thing
looks
as
if
it
could
only
have
been
broken
by
an
earthquake
sec
kitzuki
july
at
the
it
is
the
annual
festival
of
the
god
of
scholarship
the
god
of
calligraphy
tenjin
here
in
kitzuki
the
festival
of
the
divine
scribe
the
is
still
observed
according
to
the
beautiful
old
custom
which
is
being
forgotten
elsewhere
long
ranges
of
temporary
booths
have
been
erected
within
the
outer
court
of
the
temple
and
in
these
are
suspended
hundreds
of
long
white
tablets
bearing
specimens
of
calligraphy
every
schoolboy
in
kitzuki
has
a
sample
of
his
best
writing
on
exhibition
the
texts
are
written
only
in
chinese
characters
not
in
hirakana
or
katakana
and
are
mostly
drawn
from
the
works
of
confucius
or
mencius
to
me
this
display
of
ideographs
seems
a
marvellous
thing
of
beauty
almost
a
miracle
indeed
since
it
is
all
the
work
of
very
very
young
boys
rightly
enough
the
word
write
kaku
in
japanese
signifies
also
to
in
the
best
artistic
sense
i
once
had
an
opportunity
of
studying
the
result
of
an
attempt
to
teach
english
children
the
art
of
writing
japanese
these
children
were
instructed
by
a
japanese
they
sat
upon
the
same
bench
with
japanese
pupils
of
their
own
age
beginners
likewise
but
they
could
never
learn
like
the
japanese
children
the
ancestral
tendencies
within
them
rendered
vain
the
efforts
of
the
instructor
to
teach
them
the
secret
of
a
shapely
stroke
with
the
brush
it
is
not
the
japanese
boy
alone
who
writes
the
fingers
of
the
dead
move
his
brush
guide
his
strokes
beautiful
however
as
this
writing
seems
to
me
it
is
far
from
winning
the
commendation
of
my
japanese
companion
himself
a
much
experienced
teacher
greater
part
of
this
work
he
declares
very
bad
while
i
am
still
bewildered
by
this
sweeping
criticism
he
points
out
to
me
one
tablet
inscribed
with
rather
small
characters
adding
that
is
tolerably
good
i
venture
to
observe
one
would
seem
to
have
cost
much
less
trouble
the
characters
are
so
small
the
size
of
the
characters
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
interrupts
the
master
is
a
question
of
form
i
can
not
understand
what
you
call
very
bad
seems
to
me
exquisitely
beautiful
course
you
can
not
understand
the
critic
replies
would
take
you
many
years
of
study
to
understand
and
even
then
even
then
even
then
you
could
only
partly
understand
thereafter
i
hold
my
peace
on
the
topic
of
calligraphy
sec
vast
as
the
courts
of
the
are
the
crowd
within
them
is
now
so
dense
that
one
must
move
very
slowly
for
the
whole
population
of
kitzuki
and
its
environs
has
been
attracted
here
by
the
matsuri
all
are
making
their
way
very
gently
toward
a
little
shrine
built
upon
an
island
in
the
middle
of
an
artificial
lake
and
approached
by
a
narrow
causeway
this
little
shrine
which
i
see
now
for
the
first
time
kitzuki
temple
being
far
too
large
a
place
to
be
all
seen
and
known
in
a
single
visit
is
the
shrine
of
tenjin
as
the
sound
of
a
waterfall
is
the
sound
of
the
clapping
of
hands
before
it
and
myriads
of
nin
and
bushels
of
handfuls
of
rice
are
being
dropped
into
the
enormous
wooden
chest
there
placed
to
receive
the
offerings
fortunately
this
crowd
like
all
japanese
crowds
is
so
sympathetically
yielding
that
it
is
possible
to
traverse
it
slowly
in
any
direction
and
thus
to
see
all
there
is
to
be
seen
after
contributing
my
mite
to
the
coffer
of
tenjin
i
devote
my
attention
to
the
wonderful
display
of
toys
in
the
outer
courts
at
almost
every
temple
festival
in
japan
there
is
a
great
sale
of
toys
usually
within
the
court
itself
a
miniature
street
of
small
booths
being
temporarily
erected
for
this
charming
commence
every
matsuri
is
a
children
holiday
no
mother
would
think
of
attending
a
without
buying
her
child
a
toy
even
the
poorest
mother
can
afford
it
for
the
price
of
the
toys
sold
in
a
temple
court
varies
from
of
one
sen
or
japanese
cent
to
three
or
four
sen
toys
worth
so
much
as
five
sen
being
rarely
displayed
at
these
little
shops
but
cheap
as
they
are
these
frail
playthings
are
full
of
beauty
and
suggestiveness
and
to
one
who
knows
and
loves
japan
infinitely
more
interesting
than
the
costliest
inventions
of
a
parisian
many
of
them
however
would
be
utterly
incomprehensible
to
an
english
child
suppose
we
peep
at
a
few
of
them
here
is
a
little
wooden
mallet
with
a
loose
tiny
ball
fitted
into
a
socket
at
the
end
of
the
handle
this
is
for
the
baby
to
suck
on
either
end
of
the
head
of
the
mallet
is
painted
the
mystic
tomoye
that
chinese
symbol
resembling
two
huge
commas
so
united
as
to
make
a
perfect
circle
which
you
may
have
seen
on
the
of
beautiful
soul
of
the
far
east
to
you
however
this
little
wooden
mallet
would
seem
in
all
probability
just
a
little
wooden
mallet
and
nothing
more
but
to
the
japanese
child
it
is
full
of
suggestions
it
is
the
mallet
of
the
great
deity
of
kitzuki
vulgarly
called
daikoku
the
god
of
wealth
who
by
one
stroke
of
his
hammer
gives
fortune
to
his
worshippers
perhaps
this
tiny
drum
of
a
form
never
seen
in
the
occident
tsudzumi
or
this
larger
drum
with
a
mitsudomoye
or
symbol
painted
on
each
end
might
seem
to
you
without
religious
signification
but
both
are
models
of
drums
used
in
the
shinto
and
the
buddhist
temples
this
queer
tiny
table
is
a
miniature
sambo
it
is
upon
such
a
table
that
offerings
are
presented
to
the
gods
this
curious
cap
is
a
model
of
the
cap
of
a
shinto
priest
here
is
a
toy
miya
or
shinto
shrine
four
inches
high
this
bunch
of
tiny
tin
bells
attached
to
a
wooden
handle
might
seem
to
you
something
corresponding
to
our
occidental
tin
rattles
but
it
is
a
model
of
the
sacred
suzu
used
by
the
virgin
priestess
in
her
dance
before
the
gods
this
face
of
a
smiling
chubby
girl
with
two
spots
upon
her
forehead
a
mask
of
baked
clay
is
the
traditional
image
of
commonly
called
otafuku
whose
merry
laughter
lured
the
goddess
of
the
sun
out
of
the
cavern
of
darkness
and
here
is
a
little
shinto
priest
in
full
hieratic
garb
when
this
little
string
between
his
feet
is
pulled
he
claps
his
hands
as
if
in
prayer
hosts
of
other
toys
are
here
mysterious
to
the
uninitiated
european
but
to
the
japanese
child
full
of
delightful
religious
meaning
in
these
faiths
of
the
far
east
there
is
little
of
sternness
or
grimness
the
kami
are
but
the
spirits
of
the
fathers
of
the
people
the
buddhas
and
the
bosatsu
were
men
happily
the
missionaries
have
not
succeeded
as
yet
in
teaching
the
japanese
to
make
religion
a
dismal
thing
these
gods
smile
for
ever
if
you
find
one
who
frowns
like
fudo
the
frown
seems
but
half
in
earnest
it
is
only
emma
the
lord
of
death
who
somewhat
appals
why
religion
should
be
considered
too
awful
a
subject
for
children
to
amuse
themselves
decently
with
never
occurs
to
the
common
japanese
mind
so
here
we
have
images
of
the
gods
and
saints
for
toys
tenjin
the
deity
of
beautiful
writing
and
uzume
the
and
fukusuke
like
a
happy
schoolboy
and
the
seven
divinities
of
good
luck
in
a
group
and
fukurojin
the
god
of
longevity
with
head
so
elongated
that
only
by
the
aid
of
a
ladder
can
his
barber
shave
the
top
of
it
and
hotei
with
a
belly
round
and
huge
as
a
balloon
and
ebisu
the
deity
of
markets
and
of
fishermen
with
a
under
his
arm
and
daruma
ancient
disciple
of
buddha
whose
legs
were
worn
off
by
uninterrupted
meditation
here
likewise
are
many
toys
which
a
foreigner
could
scarcely
guess
the
meaning
of
although
they
have
no
religious
signification
such
is
this
little
badger
represented
as
drumming
upon
its
own
belly
with
both
forepaws
the
badger
is
believed
to
be
able
to
use
its
belly
like
a
drum
and
is
credited
by
popular
superstition
with
various
supernatural
powers
this
toy
illustrates
a
pretty
about
some
hunter
who
spared
a
badger
life
and
was
rewarded
by
the
creature
with
a
wonderful
dinner
and
a
musical
performance
here
is
a
hare
sitting
on
the
end
of
the
handle
of
a
wooden
pestle
which
is
set
horizontally
upon
a
pivot
by
pulling
a
little
string
the
pestle
is
made
to
rise
and
fall
as
if
moved
by
the
hare
if
you
have
been
even
a
week
in
japan
you
will
recognise
the
pestle
as
the
pestle
of
a
kometsuki
or
who
works
it
by
treading
on
the
handle
but
what
is
the
hare
this
hare
is
the
called
if
you
look
up
at
the
moon
on
a
clear
night
you
can
see
him
cleaning
his
rice
now
let
us
see
what
we
can
discover
in
the
way
of
cheap
ingenuities
tombo
merely
two
bits
of
wood
joined
together
in
the
form
of
a
the
lower
part
is
a
little
round
stick
about
as
thick
as
a
match
but
twice
as
long
the
upper
piece
is
flat
and
streaked
with
paint
unless
you
are
accustomed
to
look
for
secrets
you
would
scarcely
be
able
to
notice
that
the
flat
piece
is
trimmed
along
two
edges
at
a
particular
angle
twirl
the
lower
piece
rapidly
between
the
palms
of
both
hands
and
suddenly
let
it
go
at
once
the
strange
toy
rises
revolving
in
the
air
and
then
sails
away
slowly
to
quite
a
distance
performing
extraordinary
gyrations
and
imitating
exactly
to
the
eye
at
least
the
hovering
motion
of
a
those
little
streaks
of
paint
you
noticed
upon
the
now
reveal
their
purpose
as
the
tombo
darts
hither
and
thither
even
the
tints
appear
to
be
those
of
a
real
and
even
the
sound
of
the
flitting
toy
imitates
the
hum
the
principle
of
this
pretty
invention
is
much
like
that
of
the
boomerang
and
an
expert
can
make
his
tombo
after
flying
across
a
large
room
return
into
his
hand
all
the
tombo
sold
however
are
not
as
good
as
this
one
we
have
been
lucky
price
of
one

here
is
a
toy
which
looks
like
a
bow

this
spiral
a
pair

tiny

suspended
by
a
metal
loop
when
the
bow
is
held
perpendicularly
with
the
birds
at
the
upper
end
of
the
string
they
descend
whirling
by
their
own
weight
as
if
circling
round
one
another
and
the
twittering
of
two
birds
is
imitated
by
the
sharp
grating
of
the
metal
loop
upon
the
spiral
wire
one
bird
flies
head
upward
and
the
other
tail
upward
as
soon
as
they
have
reached
the
bottom
reverse
the

recommence

expanded
it

one
rin
the
most
charming
of
all
these
things
to
me
however
is
a
tiny
doll
honourable
miss
hina
or
beppin
woman
the
body
is
a
phantom
only
a
flat
stick
covered
with
a
paper
kimono
but
the
head
is
really
a
work
of
art
a
pretty
oval
face
with
softly
shadowed
oblique
eyes
looking
shyly
downward
and
a
wonderful
maiden
coiffure
in
which
the
hair
is
arranged
in
bands
and
volutes
and
ellipses
and
convolutions
and
foliole
curlings
most
beautiful
and
extraordinary
in
some
respects
this
toy
is
a
costume
model
for
it
imitates
exactly
the
real
coiffure
of
japanese
maidens
and
brides
but
the
expression
of
the
face
of
the
beppin
is
i
think
the
great
attraction
of
the
toy
there
is
a
shy
plaintive
sweetness
about
it
impossible
to
describe
but
deliciously
suggestive
of
a
real
japanese
type
of
yet
the
whole
thing
is
made
out
of
a
little
crumpled
paper
coloured
with
a
few
dashes
of
the
brush
by
an
expert
hand
there
are
no
two
exactly
alike
out
of
millions
and
when
you
have
become
familiar
by
long
residence
with
japanese
types
any
such
doll
will
recall
to
you
some
pretty
face
that
you
have
seen
these
are
for
little
girls
price
five
rin
sec
here
let
me
tell
you
something
you
certainly
never
heard
of
before
in
relation
to
japanese
dolls
not
the
tiny
i
was
just
speaking
about
but
the
beautiful
dolls
representing
children
of
two
or
three
years
old
real
which
although
far
more
cheaply
and
simply
constructed
than
our
finer
kinds
of
western
dolls
become
under
the
handling
of
a
japanese
girl
infinitely
more
interesting
such
dolls
are
well
dressed
and
look
so
little
slanting
eyes
shaven
pates
smiles
and
all
that
as
seen
from
a
short
distance
the
best
eyes
might
be
deceived
by
them
therefore
in
those
stock
photographs
of
japanese
life
of
which
so
many
thousands
are
sold
in
the
open
ports
the
conventional
baby
on
the
mother
back
is
most
successfully
represented
by
a
doll
even
the
camera
does
not
betray
the
substitution
and
if
you
see
such
a
doll
though
held
quite
close
to
you
being
made
by
a
japanese
mother
to
reach
out
his
hands
to
move
its
little
bare
feet
and
to
turn
its
head
you
would
be
almost
afraid
to
venture
a
heavy
wager
that
it
was
only
a
doll
even
after
having
closely
examined
the
thing
you
would
still
i
fancy
feel
a
little
nervous
at
being
left
alone
with
it
so
perfect
the
delusion
of
that
expert
handling
now
there
is
a
belief
that
some
dolls
do
actually
become
alive
formerly
the
belief
was
less
rare
than
it
is
now
certain
dolls
were
spoken
of
with
a
reverence
worthy
of
the
kami
and
their
owners
were
envied
folk
such
a
doll
was
treated
like
a
real
son
or
daughter
it
was
regularly
served
with
food
it
had
a
bed
and
plenty
of
nice
clothes
and
a
name
if
in
the
semblance
of
a
girl
it
was
if
in
that
of
a
boy
it
was
thought
that
the
doll
would
become
angry
and
cry
if
neglected
and
that
any
of
it
would
bring
to
the
house
and
moreover
it
was
believed
to
possess
supernatural
powers
of
a
very
high
order
in
the
family
of
one
sengoku
a
samurai
of
matsue
there
was
a
which
had
a
local
reputation
scarcely
inferior
to
that
of
kishibojin
she
to
whom
japanese
wives
pray
for
offspring
and
childless
couples
used
to
borrow
that
doll
and
keep
it
for
a
time
ministering
unto
it
and
furnish
it
with
new
clothes
before
gratefully
returning
it
to
its
owners
and
all
who
did
so
i
am
assured
became
parents
according
to
their
heart
desire
doll
had
a
soul
there
is
even
a
legend
that
once
when
the
house
caught
fire
the
tokutar
ran
out
safely
into
the
garden
of
its
own
accord
the
idea
about
such
a
doll
seems
to
be
this
the
new
doll
is
only
a
doll
but
a
doll
which
is
preserved
for
a
great
many
years
in
one
family
and
is
loved
and
played
with
by
generations
of
children
gradually
acquires
a
soul
i
asked
a
charming
japanese
girl
can
a
doll
live
she
answered
you
love
it
enough
it
will
live
what
is
this
but
renan
thought
of
a
deity
in
process
of
evolution
uttered
by
the
heart
of
a
child
sec
but
even
the
most
beloved
dolls
are
worn
out
at
last
or
get
broken
in
the
course
of
centuries
and
when
a
doll
must
be
considered
quite
dead
its
remains
are
still
entitled
to
respect
never
is
the
corpse
of
a
doll
irreverently
thrown
away
neither
is
it
burned
or
cast
into
pure
running
water
as
all
sacred
objects
of
the
miya
must
be
when
they
have
ceased
to
be
serviceable
and
it
is
not
buried
you
could
not
possibly
imagine
what
is
done
with
it
it
is
dedicated
to
the
god
kojin
a
somewhat
mysterious
divinity
the
ancient
buddhist
images
of
kojin
represented
a
deity
with
many
arms
the
shinto
kojin
of
izumo
has
i
believe
no
artistic
representation
whatever
but
in
almost
every
shinto
and
also
in
many
buddhist
temple
grounds
is
planted
the
tree
called
enoki
which
is
sacred
to
him
and
in
which
he
is
supposed
by
the
peasantry
to
dwell
for
they
pray
before
the
enoki
always
to
kojin
and
there
is
usually
a
small
shrine
placed
before
the
tree
and
a
little
torii
also
now
you
may
often
see
laid
upon
such
a
shrine
of
kojin
or
at
the
foot
of
his
sacred
tree
or
in
a
hollow
thereof
if
there
be
any
hollow
pathetic
remains
of
dolls
but
a
doll
is
seldom
given
to
kojin
during
the
lifetime
of
its
possessor
when
you
see
one
thus
exposed
you
may
be
almost
certain
that
it
was
found
among
the
effects
of
some
poor
dead
woman
the
innocent
memento
of
her
girlhood
perhaps
even
also
of
the
girlhood
of
her
mother
and
of
her
mother
mother
sec
and
now
we
are
to
see
the
which
begins
at
eight
there
is
no
moon
and
the
night
is
overhead
but
there
is
plenty
of
light
in
the
broad
court
of
the
guji
residence
for
a
hundred
lanterns
have
been
kindled
and
hung
out
i
and
my
friend
have
been
provided
with
comfortable
places
in
the
great
pavilion
which
opens
upon
the
court
and
the
pontiff
has
had
prepared
for
us
a
delicious
little
supper
already
thousands
have
assembled
before
the
pavilion
young
men
of
kitzuki
and
young
peasants
from
the
environs
and
women
and
children
in
multitude
and
hundreds
of
young
girls
the
court
is
so
thronged
that
it
is
difficult
to
assume
the
possibility
of
any
dance
illuminated
by
the
the
scene
is
more
than
picturesque
it
is
a
carnivalesque
display
of
of
course
the
peasants
come
in
their
ancient
attire
some
in
mino
or
overcoats
of
yellow
straw
others
with
blue
towels
tied
round
their
heads
many
with
enormous
mushroom
hats
all
with
their
blue
robes
well
tucked
up
but
the
young
townsmen
come
in
all
guises
and
disguises
many
have
dressed
themselves
in
female
attire
some
are
all
in
white
duck
like
police
some
have
mantles
on
others
wear
shawls
exactly
as
a
mexican
wears
his
zarape
numbers
of
young
artisans
appear
almost
as
lightly
clad
as
in
barelegged
to
the
hips
and
barearmed
to
the
shoulders
among
the
girls
some
wonderful
dressing
is
to
be
seen
robes
and
rich
greys
and
browns
and
purples
confined
with
exquisite
obi
or
girdles
of
figured
satin
but
the
best
taste
is
shown
in
the
simple
and
very
graceful
black
and
white
costumes
worn
by
some
maidens
of
the
better
classes
dresses
especially
made
for
dancing
and
not
to
be
worn
at
any
other
time
a
few
shy
damsels
have
completely
masked
themselves
by
tying
down
over
their
cheeks
the
flexible
brims
of
very
broad
straw
hats
i
can
not
attempt
to
talk
about
the
delicious
costumes
of
the
children
as
well
try
to
describe
without
paint
the
variegated
loveliness
of
moths
and
butterflies
in
the
centre
of
this
multitude
i
see
a
huge
turned
upside
down
and
presently
a
sandalled
peasant
leaps
upon
it
lightly
and
stands
there
with
an
open
paper
umbrella
above
his
head
nevertheless
it
is
not
raining
that
is
the
the
leader
of
the
dance
who
is
celebrated
through
all
izumo
as
a
singer
according
to
ancient
custom
the
leader
of
the
always
holds
an
open
umbrella
above
his
head
while
he
sings
suddenly
at
a
signal
from
the
guji
who
has
just
taken
his
place
in
the
pavilion
the
voice
of
the
intoning
the
song
of
thanksgiving
rings
out
over
all
the
murmuring
of
the
multitude
like
a
silver
cornet
a
wondrous
voice
and
a
wondrous
song
full
of
trills
and
quaverings
indescribable
but
full
also
of
sweetness
and
true
musical
swing
and
as
he
sings
he
turns
slowly
round
upon
his
high
pedestal
with
the
umbrella
always
above
his
head
never
halting
in
his
rotation
from
right
to
left
but
pausing
for
a
regular
interval
in
his
singing
at
the
close
of
each
two
verses
when
the
people
respond
with
a
joyous
outcry
simultaneously
an
astonishingly
rapid
movement
of
segregation
takes
place
in
the
crowd
two
enormous
rings
of
dancers
form
one
within
the
other
the
rest
of
the
people
pressing
back
to
make
room
for
the
odori
and
then
this
great
formed
by
fully
five
hundred
dancers
begins
also
to
revolve
from
right
to
left
lightly
fantastically
all
the
tossing
of
arms
and
white
twinkling
of
feet
keeping
faultless
time
to
the
measured
syllabification
of
the
chant
an
immense
wheel
the
dance
is
with
the
for
its
axis
always
turning
slowly
upon
his
under
his
open
umbrella
as
he
sings
the
song
of
harvest
thanksgiving
itsutsu
nanatsu
yattsu
kokonotsu
and
the
voices
of
all
the
dancers
in
unison
roll
out
the
chorus
utterly
different
this
whirling
joyous
from
the
which
i
witnessed
last
year
at
and
which
seemed
to
me
a
very
dance
of
ghosts
but
it
is
also
much
more
difficult
to
describe
each
dancer
makes
a
alternately
to
left
and
right
with
a
peculiar
bending
of
the
knees
and
tossing
up
of
the
hands
at
the
same
time
as
in
the
act
of
lifting
a
weight
above
the
head
but
there
are
other
curious
movements
jerky
with
the
men
undulatory
with
the
women
as
impossible
to
describe
as
water
in
motion
these
are
decidedly
complex
yet
so
regular
that
five
hundred
pairs
of
feet
and
hands
mark
the
measure
of
the
song
as
truly
as
if
they
were
under
the
control
of
a
single
nervous
system
it
is
strangely
difficult
to
memorise
the
melody
of
a
japanese
popular
song
or
the
movements
of
a
japanese
dance
for
the
song
and
the
dance
have
been
evolved
through
an
aesthetic
sense
of
rhythm
in
sound
and
in
motion
as
different
from
the
corresponding
occidental
sense
as
english
is
different
from
chinese
we
have
no
ancestral
sympathies
with
these
exotic
rhythms
no
inherited
aptitudes
for
their
instant
comprehension
no
racial
impulses
whatever
in
harmony
with
them
but
when
they
have
become
familiar
through
study
after
a
long
residence
in
the
orient
how
nervously
fascinant
the
oscillation
of
the
dance
and
the
singular
swing
of
the
song
this
dance
i
know
began
at
eight
and
the
after
having
sung
without
a
falter
in
his
voice
for
an
extraordinary
time
has
been
relieved
by
a
second
but
the
great
round
never
breaks
never
slackens
its
whirl
it
only
enlarges
as
the
night
wears
on
and
the
second
is
relieved
by
a
third
yet
i
would
like
to
watch
that
dance
for
ever
time
do
you
think
it
is
my
friend
asks
looking
at
his
watch
eleven
i
make
answer
it
is
exactly
eight
minutes
to
three
and
our
host
will
have
little
time
for
sleep
before
the
rising
of
the
sun
chapter
twelve
at
hinomisaki
kitzuki
august
my
japanese
friends
urge
me
to
visit
hinomisaki
where
no
european
has
ever
been
and
where
there
is
a
double
temple
dedicated
to
the
lady
of
light
and
to
her
divine
brother
hinomisaki
is
a
little
village
on
the
izumo
coast
about
five
miles
from
kitzuki
it
maybe
reached
by
a
mountain
path
but
the
way
is
extremely
steep
rough
and
fatiguing
by
boat
when
the
weather
is
fair
the
trip
is
very
agreeable
so
with
a
friend
i
start
for
hinomisaki
in
a
very
cozy
ryosen
skilfully
sculled
by
two
young
fishermen
leaving
the
pretty
bay
of
inasa
we
follow
the
coast
to
the
right
a
very
lofty
and
grim
coast
without
a
beach
below
us
the
clear
water
gradually
darkens
to
inky
blackness
as
the
depth
increases
but
at
intervals
pale
jagged
rocks
rise
up
from
this
nether
darkness
to
catch
the
light
fifty
feet
under
the
surface
we
keep
tolerably
close
to
the
cliffs
which
vary
in
height
from
three
hundred
to
six
hundred
feet
their
bases
rising
from
the
water
all
dull
their
sides
and
summits
green
with
young
pines
and
dark
grasses
that
toughen
in
all
the
coast
is
abrupt
ravined
irregular
curiously
breached
and
fissured
vast
masses
of
it
have
toppled
into
the
sea
and
the
black
ruins
project
from
the
deep
in
a
hundred
shapes
of
menace
sometimes
our
boat
glides
between
a
double
line
of
these
or
takes
a
zigzag
course
through
labyrinths
of
so
swiftly
and
deftly
is
the
little
craft
impelled
to
right
and
left
that
one
could
almost
believe
it
sees
its
own
way
and
moves
by
its
own
intelligence
and
again
we
pass
by
extraordinary
islets
of
prismatic
rock
whose
sides
just
below
the
are
heavily
mossed
with
seaweed
the
polygonal
masses
composing
these
shapes
are
called
by
the
fishermen
stones
there
is
a
legend
that
once
to
try
his
strength
came
here
and
lifting
up
one
of
these
masses
of
basalt
flung
it
across
the
sea
to
the
mountain
of
sanbeyama
at
the
foot
of
sanbe
the
mighty
rock
thus
thrown
by
the
great
deity
of
kitzuki
may
still
be
seen
it
is
alleged
even
unto
this
day
more
and
more
bare
and
rugged
and
ghastly
the
coast
becomes
as
we
journey
on
and
the
sunken
ledges
more
numerous
and
the
protruding
rocks
more
dangerous
splinters
of
strata
piercing
the
from
a
depth
of
thirty
fathoms
then
suddenly
our
boat
makes
a
dash
for
the
black
cliff
and
shoots
into
a
tremendous
cleft
of
it
an
earthquake
fissure
with
sides
lofty
and
perpendicular
as
the
walls
of
a
lo
there
is
daylight
ahead
this
is
a
miniature
strait
a
short
cut
to
the
bay
we
glide
through
it
in
ten
minutes
reach
open
water
again
and
hinomisaki
is
before
us
a
semicircle
of
houses
clustering
about
a
bay
curve
with
an
opening
in
their
centre
prefaced
by
a
torii
of
all
bays
i
have
ever
seen
this
is
the
most
extraordinary
imagine
an
enormous
torn
out
and
broken
down
level
with
the
sea
so
as
to
leave
a
great
hollow
in
the
land
with
one
original
fragment
of
the
ancient
cliff
still
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
gap
a
monstrous
square
tower
of
rock
bearing
trees
upon
its
summit
and
a
thousand
yards
out
from
the
shore
rises
another
colossal
rock
fully
one
hundred
feet
high
this
is
known
by
the
name
of
fumishima
or
okyogashima
and
the
temple
of
the
which
we
are
now
about
to
see
formerly
stood
upon
that
islet
the
same
appalling
forces
which
formed
the
bay
of
hinomisaki
doubtless
also
detached
the
gigantic
mass
of
fumishima
from
this
iron
coast
we
land
at
the
right
end
of
the
bay
here
also
there
is
no
beach
the
water
is
close
to
the
shore
which
slopes
up
rapidly
as
we
mount
the
slope
an
extraordinary
spectacle
is
before
us
upon
thousands
and
thousands
of
bamboo
frames
shaped
somewhat
like
our
are
dangling
countless
pale
yellowish
things
the
nature
of
which
i
can
not
discern
at
first
glance
but
a
closer
inspection
reveals
the
mystery
millions
of
cuttlefish
drying
in
the
sun
i
could
never
have
believed
that
so
many
cuttlefish
existed
in
these
waters
and
there
is
scarcely
any
variation
in
the
dimensions
of
them
out
of
ten
thousand
there
is
not
the
difference
of
half
an
inch
in
length
sec
the
great
torii
which
forms
the
of
hinomisaki
is
of
white
granite
and
severely
beautiful
through
it
we
pass
up
the
main
street
of
the
village
surprisingly
wide
for
about
a
thousand
yards
after
which
it
narrows
into
a
common
highway
which
slopes
up
a
wooded
hill
and
disappears
under
the
shadow
of
trees
on
the
right
as
you
enter
the
street
is
a
long
vision
of
grey
wooden
houses
with
awnings
and
balconies
little
shops
little
dwellings
of
fishermen
and
ranging
away
in
front
of
these
other
hosts
of
bamboo
frames
from
which
other
millions
of
freshly
caught
cuttlefish
are
hanging
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
rises
a
cyclopean
retaining
wall
massive
as
the
wall
of
a
daimyo
castle
and
topped
by
a
lofty
wooden
parapet
pierced
with
gates
and
above
it
tower
the
roofs
of
majestic
buildings
whose
architecture
strongly
resembles
that
of
the
structures
of
kitzuki
and
behind
all
appears
a
beautiful
green
background
of
hills
this
is
the
but
one
must
walk
some
considerable
distance
up
the
road
to
reach
the
main
entrance
of
the
court
which
is
at
the
farther
end
of
the
inclosure
and
is
approached
by
an
imposing
broad
flight
of
granite
steps
the
great
court
is
a
surprise
it
is
almost
as
deep
as
the
outer
court
of
the
though
not
nearly
so
wide
and
a
paved
cloister
forms
two
sides
of
it
from
the
court
gate
a
broad
paved
walk
leads
to
the
haiden
and
shamusho
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
court
spacious
and
dignified
structures
above
whose
roofs
appears
the
quaint
and
massive
gable
of
the
main
temple
with
its
fantastic
this
temple
standing
with
its
back
to
the
sea
is
the
shrine
of
the
goddess
of
the
sun
on
the
right
side
of
the
main
court
as
you
enter
another
broad
flight
of
steps
leads
up
to
a
loftier
court
where
another
fine
group
of
shinto
buildings
stands
a
haiden
and
a
miya
but
these
are
much
smaller
like
miniatures
of
those
below
their
woodwork
also
appears
to
be
quite
new
the
upper
miya
is
the
shrine
of
the
god
brother
of
sec
to
me
the
great
marvel
of
the
is
that
structures
so
vast
and
so
costly
to
maintain
can
exist
in
a
mere
fishing
hamlet
in
an
obscure
nook
of
the
most
desolate
coast
of
japan
assuredly
the
contributions
of
peasant
pilgrims
alone
could
not
suffice
to
pay
the
salary
of
a
single
kannushi
for
hinomisaki
unlike
kitzuki
is
not
a
place
possible
to
visit
in
all
weathers
my
friend
confirms
me
in
this
opinion
but
i
learn
from
him
that
the
temples
have
three
large
sources
of
revenue
they
are
partly
supported
by
the
government
they
receive
yearly
large
gifts
of
money
from
pious
merchants
and
the
revenues
from
lands
attached
to
them
also
represent
a
considerable
sum
certainly
a
great
amount
of
money
must
have
been
very
recently
expended
here
for
the
smaller
of
the
two
miya
seems
to
have
just
been
wholly
rebuilt
the
beautiful
joinery
is
all
white
with
freshness
and
even
the
odorous
chips
have
not
yet
been
all
removed
at
the
shamusho
we
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
guji
of
hinomisaki
a
man
in
the
prime
of
life
with
one
of
those
fine
aquiline
faces
rarely
to
be
met
with
except
among
the
high
aristocracy
of
japan
he
wears
a
heavy
black
moustache
which
gives
him
in
spite
of
his
priestly
robes
the
look
of
a
retired
army
officer
we
are
kindly
permitted
by
him
to
visit
the
sacred
shrines
and
a
kannushi
is
detailed
to
conduct
us
through
the
buildings
something
resembling
the
severe
simplicity
of
the
was
what
i
expected
to
see
but
this
shrine
of
the
goddess
of
the
sun
is
a
spectacle
of
such
splendour
that
for
the
first
moment
i
almost
doubt
whether
i
am
really
in
a
shinto
temple
in
very
truth
there
is
nothing
of
pure
shinto
here
these
shrines
belong
to
the
famous
period
of
when
the
ancient
faith
interpenetrated
and
allied
with
buddhism
adopted
the
ceremonial
magnificence
and
the
marvellous
decorative
art
of
the
alien
creed
since
visiting
the
great
buddhist
shrines
of
the
capital
i
have
seen
no
temple
interior
to
be
compared
with
this
daintily
beautiful
as
a
casket
is
the
chamber
of
the
shrine
all
its
elaborated
woodwork
is
lacquered
in
scarlet
and
gold
the
is
a
delight
of
carving
and
colour
the
ceiling
swarms
with
dreams
of
clouds
and
dragons
and
yet
the
exquisite
taste
of
the
decorators
buried
doubtless
five
hundred
years
ago
has
so
justly
proportioned
the
decoration
to
the
needs
of
surface
so
admirably
blended
the
colours
that
there
is
no
gaudiness
no
glare
only
an
opulent
repose
this
shrine
is
surrounded
by
a
light
outer
gallery
which
is
not
visible
from
the
lower
court
and
from
this
gallery
one
can
study
some
remarkable
friezes
occupying
the
spaces
above
the
doorways
and
below
the
eaves
friezes
surrounding
the
walls
of
the
miya
these
although
exposed
for
many
centuries
to
the
terrific
weather
of
the
western
coast
still
remain
masterpieces
of
quaint
carving
there
are
apes
and
hares
peeping
through
wonderfully
chiselled
leaves
and
doves
and
demons
and
dragons
writhing
in
storms
and
while
looking
up
at
these
my
eye
is
attracted
by
a
peculiar
velvety
appearance
of
the
woodwork
forming
the
immense
projecting
eaves
of
the
roof
under
the
tiling
it
is
more
than
a
foot
thick
by
standing
on
tiptoe
i
can
touch
it
and
i
discover
that
it
is
even
more
velvety
to
the
touch
than
to
the
sight
further
examination
reveals
the
fact
that
this
colossal
roofing
is
not
solid
timber
only
the
beams
are
solid
the
enormous
pieces
they
support
are
formed
of
countless
broad
slices
thin
as
the
thinnest
shingles
superimposed
and
cemented
together
into
one
mass
i
am
told
that
this
composite
woodwork
is
more
enduring
than
any
hewn
timber
could
be
the
edges
where
exposed
to
wind
and
sun
feel
to
the
touch
just
like
the
edges
of
the
leaves
of
some
huge
volume
and
their
stained
velvety
yellowish
aspect
so
perfectly
mocks
the
appearance
of
a
book
that
while
trying
to
separate
them
a
little
with
my
fingers
i
find
myself
involuntarily
peering
for
a
and
the
number
of
a
folio
we
then
visit
the
smaller
temple
the
interior
of
the
sacred
chamber
is
equally
rich
in
lacquered
decoration
and
gilding
and
below
the
miya
itself
there
are
strange
paintings
of
weird
foxes
foxes
wandering
in
the
foreground
of
a
mountain
landscape
but
here
the
colours
have
been
damaged
somewhat
by
time
the
paintings
have
a
faded
look
without
the
shrine
are
other
wonderful
carvings
doubtless
executed
by
the
same
chisel
which
created
the
friezes
of
the
larger
temple
i
learn
that
only
the
of
both
temples
are
very
old
all
the
rest
has
been
more
than
once
rebuilt
the
entire
structure
of
the
smaller
temple
and
its
haiden
with
the
exception
of
the
has
just
been
rebuilt
in
fact
the
work
is
not
yet
quite
done
so
that
the
emblem
of
the
deity
is
not
at
present
in
the
sanctuary
the
shrines
proper
are
never
repaired
but
simply
reinclosed
in
the
new
buildings
when
reconstruction
becomes
a
necessity
to
repair
them
or
restore
them
would
be
impossible
the
art
that
created
them
is
dead
but
so
excellent
their
material
and
its
lacquer
envelope
that
they
have
suffered
little
in
the
lapse
of
many
centuries
from
the
attacks
of
time
one
more
surprise
awaits
me
the
homestead
of
the
high
pontiff
who
most
kindly
invites
us
to
dine
with
him
which
hospitality
is
all
the
more
acceptable
from
the
fact
that
there
is
no
hotel
in
hinomisaki
but
only
a
kichinyado
for
pilgrims
the
ancestral
residence
of
the
high
pontiffs
of
hinomisaki
occupies
with
the
beautiful
gardens
about
it
a
space
fully
equal
to
that
of
the
great
temple
courts
themselves
like
most
of
the
homes
of
the
nobility
and
of
the
samurai
it
is
but
one
story
high
an
immense
elevated
cottage
one
might
call
it
but
the
apartments
are
lofty
spacious
and
very
handsome
and
there
is
a
room
of
one
hundred
mats
a
very
nice
little
repast
with
abundance
of
good
wine
is
served
up
to
us
and
i
shall
always
remember
one
curious
dish
which
i
at
first
mistake
for
spinach
it
is
seaweed
deliciously
prepared
not
the
common
edible
seaweed
but
a
rare
sort
fine
like
moss
after
bidding
farewell
to
our
generous
host
we
take
an
uphill
stroll
to
the
farther
end
of
the
village
we
leave
the
cuttlefish
behind
but
before
us
the
greater
part
of
the
road
is
covered
with
matting
upon
which
indigo
is
drying
in
the
sun
the
village
terminates
abruptly
at
the
top
of
the
hill
where
there
is
another
grand
granite
torii
a
structure
so
ponderous
that
it
is
almost
as
difficult
to
imagine
how
it
was
ever
brought
up
the
hill
as
to
understand
the
methods
of
the
builders
of
stonehenge
from
this
torii
the
road
descends
to
the
pretty
little
seaport
of
on
the
other
side
of
the
cape
for
hinomisaki
is
situated
on
one
side
of
a
great
promontory
as
its
name
implies
a
projecting
into
the
japanese
sea
sec
the
family
of
the
guji
of
hinomisaki
is
one
of
the
oldest
of
the
kwazoku
or
noble
families
of
izumo
and
the
daughters
are
still
addressed
by
the
antique
title
of
princess
the
ancient
official
designation
of
the
pontiff
himself
was
kengyo
as
that
of
the
kitzuki
pontiff
was
kokuzo
and
the
families
of
the
hinomisaki
and
of
the
kitzuki
guji
are
closely
related
there
is
one
touching
and
terrible
tradition
in
the
long
history
of
the
kengyos
of
hinomisaki
which
throws
a
strange
light
upon
the
social
condition
of
this
province
in
feudal
days
seven
generations
ago
a
matsudaira
daimyo
of
izumo
made
with
great
pomp
his
first
official
visit
to
the
temples
of
hinomisaki
and
was
nobly
entertained
by
the
kengyo
doubtless
in
the
same
chamber
of
a
hundred
mats
which
we
were
privileged
to
see
according
to
custom
the
young
wife
of
the
host
waited
upon
the
regal
visitor
and
served
him
with
dainties
and
with
wine
she
was
singularly
beautiful
and
her
beauty
unfortunately
bewitched
the
daimyo
with
kingly
insolence
he
demanded
that
she
should
leave
her
husband
and
become
his
concubine
although
astounded
and
terrified
she
answered
bravely
like
the
true
daughter
of
a
samurai
that
she
was
a
loving
wife
and
mother
and
that
sooner
than
desert
her
husband
and
her
child
she
would
put
an
end
to
her
life
with
her
own
hand
the
great
lord
of
izumo
sullenly
departed
without
further
speech
leaving
the
little
household
plunged
in
uttermost
grief
and
anxiety
for
it
was
too
well
known
that
the
prince
would
suffer
no
obstacle
to
remain
in
the
way
of
his
lust
or
his
hate
the
anxiety
indeed
proved
to
be
well
founded
scarcely
had
the
daimyo
returned
to
his
domains
when
he
began
to
devise
means
for
the
ruin
of
the
kengyo
soon
afterward
the
latter
was
suddenly
and
forcibly
separated
from
his
family
hastily
tried
for
some
imaginary
offence
and
banished
to
the
islands
of
oki
some
say
the
ship
on
which
he
sailed
went
down
at
sea
with
all
on
board
others
say
that
he
was
conveyed
to
oki
but
only
to
die
there
of
misery
and
cold
at
all
events
the
old
izumo
records
state
that
in
the
year
corresponding
to
kengyo
takatoshi
died
in
the
land
of
oki
on
receiving
news
of
the
kengyo
death
matsudaira
scarcely
concealed
his
exultation
the
object
of
his
passion
was
the
daughter
of
his
own
karo
or
minister
one
of
the
noblest
samurai
of
matsue
by
name
kamiya
kamiya
was
at
once
summoned
before
the
daimyo
who
said
to
him
daughter
husband
being
dead
there
exists
no
longer
any
reason
that
she
should
not
enter
into
my
household
do
thou
bring
her
hither
the
karo
touched
the
floor
with
his
forehead
and
departed
on
his
errand
upon
the
following
day
he
the
prince
apartment
and
performing
the
customary
prostration
announced
that
his
lord
commands
had
been
obeyed
that
the
victim
had
arrived
smiling
for
pleasure
the
matsudaira
ordered
that
she
should
be
brought
at
once
into
his
presence
the
karo
prostrated
himself
retired
and
presently
returning
placed
before
his
master
a
upon
which
lay
the
head
of
a
beautiful
woman
the
head
of
the
young
wife
of
the
dead
kengyo
with
the
simple
utterance
is
my
daughter
dead
by
her
own
brave
will
but
never
dishonoured
seven
generations
have
been
buried
since
the
matsudaira
strove
to
appease
his
remorse
by
the
building
of
temples
and
the
erection
of
monuments
to
the
memory
of
his
victim
his
own
race
died
with
him
those
who
now
bear
the
illustrious
name
of
that
long
line
of
daimyos
are
not
of
the
same
blood
and
the
grim
ruin
of
his
castle
devoured
by
vegetation
is
tenanted
only
by
lizards
and
bats
but
the
kamiya
family
endures
no
longer
wealthy
as
in
feudal
times
but
still
highly
honoured
in
their
native
city
and
each
high
pontiff
of
hinomisakei
chooses
always
his
bride
from
among
the
daughters
of
that
valiant
race
the
kengyo
of
the
above
tradition
was
enshrined
by
matsudaira
in
the
temple
of
at
oyama
near
matsue
this
miya
was
built
for
an
atonement
and
the
people
still
pray
to
the
spirit
of
the
kengyo
near
this
temple
formerly
stood
a
very
popular
theatre
also
erected
by
the
daimyo
in
his
earnest
desire
to
appease
the
soul
of
his
victim
for
he
had
heard
that
the
kengyo
was
very
fond
of
theatrical
performances
the
temple
is
still
in
excellent
preservation
but
the
theatre
has
long
since
disappeared
and
its
site
is
occupied
by
a

they
are
too
unhappy
to
endure
existence
the
fault
is
not
another
nor
yet
the
world
it
is
their
own
it
is
innen
the
result
of
errors
in
a
previous
life
if
they
can
never
hope
to
be
united
in
this
world
it
is
only
because
in
some
former
birth
they
broke
their
promise
to
wed
or
were
otherwise
cruel
to
each
other
all
this
is
not
heterodox
but
they
believe
likewise
that
by
dying
together
they
will
find
themselves
at
once
united
in
another
world
though
buddhism
proclaims
that
is
a
deadly
sin
now
this
idea
of
winning
union
through
death
is
incalculably
older
than
the
faith
of
shaka
but
it
has
somehow
borrowed
in
modern
time
from
buddhism
a
particular
ecstatic
colouring
a
mystical
glow
hasu
no
hana
no
ue
ni
oite
matan
on
the
of
paradise
they
shall
rest
together
buddhism
teaches
of
transmigrations
countless
prolonged
through
millions
of
millions
of
years
before
the
soul
can
acquire
the
infinite
vision
the
infinite
memory
and
melt
into
the
bliss
of
nehan
as
a
white
cloud
melts
into
the
summer
blue
but
these
suffering
ones
think
never
of
nehan
love
union
their
supremest
wish
may
be
reached
they
fancy
through
the
pang
of
a
single
death
the
fancies
of
all
indeed
as
their
poor
letters
show
are
not
the
same
some
think
themselves
about
to
enter
amida
paradise
of
light
some
see
in
their
visional
hope
the
only
the
future
rebirth
when
beloved
shall
meet
beloved
again
in
the
freshness
of
another
youth
while
the
idea
of
many
indeed
of
the
majority
is
vaguer
far
only
a
shadowy
drifting
together
through
vapoury
silences
as
in
the
faint
bliss
of
dreams
they
always
pray
to
be
buried
together
often
this
prayer
is
refused
by
the
parents
or
the
guardians
and
the
people
deem
this
refusal
a
cruel
thing
for
is
believed
that
those
who
die
for
love
of
each
other
will
find
no
rest
if
denied
the
same
tomb
but
when
the
prayer
is
granted
the
ceremony
of
burial
is
beautiful
and
touching
from
the
two
homes
the
two
funeral
processions
issue
to
meet
in
the
temple
court
by
light
of
lanterns
there
after
the
recitation
of
the
kyo
and
the
accustomed
impressive
ceremonies
the
chief
priest
utters
an
address
to
the
souls
of
the
dead
compassionately
he
speaks
of
the
error
and
the
sin
of
the
youth
of
the
victims
brief
and
comely
as
the
flowers
that
blossom
and
fall
in
the
first
burst
of
spring
he
speaks
of
the
illusion
mayoi
which
so
wrought
upon
them
he
recites
the
warning
of
the
teacher
but
sometimes
he
will
even
predict
the
future
reunion
of
the
lovers
in
some
happier
and
higher
life
the
popular
with
a
simple
eloquence
that
makes
his
hearers
weep
then
the
two
processions
form
into
one
which
takes
its
way
to
the
cemetery
where
the
grave
has
already
been
prepared
the
two
coffins
are
lowered
together
so
that
their
sides
touch
as
they
rest
at
the
bottom
of
the
excavation
then
the
folk
remove
the
planks
which
separate
the
pair
making
the
two
coffins
into
one
above
the
reunited
dead
the
earth
is
heaped
and
a
haka
bearing
in
chiselled
letters
the
story
of
their
fate
and
perhaps
a
little
poem
is
placed
above
the
mingling
of
their
dust
sec
these
suicides
of
lovers
are
termed
or
both
words
being
written
with
the
same
chinese
characters
signifying
or
they
most
commonly
occur
in
the
case
of
women
among
the
joro
class
but
occasionally
also
among
young
girls
of
a
more
respectable
class
there
is
a
fatalistic
belief
that
if
one
shinju
occurs
among
the
inmates
of
a
joroya
two
more
are
sure
to
follow
doubtless
the
belief
itself
is
the
cause
that
cases
of
shinju
do
commonly
occur
in
series
of
three
the
poor
girls
who
voluntarily
sell
themselves
to
a
life
of
shame
for
the
sake
of
their
families
in
time
of
uttermost
distress
do
not
in
japan
except
perhaps
in
those
open
ports
where
european
vice
and
brutality
have
become
demoralising
influences
ever
reach
that
depth
of
degradation
to
which
their
western
sisters
descend
many
indeed
retain
through
all
the
period
of
their
terrible
servitude
a
refinement
of
manner
a
delicacy
of
sentiment
and
a
natural
modesty
that
seem
under
such
conditions
as
extraordinary
as
they
are
touching
only
yesterday
a
case
of
shinju
startled
this
quiet
city
the
servant
of
a
physician
in
the
street
called
nadamachi
entering
the
chamber
of
his
master
son
a
little
after
sunrise
found
the
young
man
lying
dead
with
a
dead
girl
in
his
arms
the
son
had
been
disinherited
the
girl
was
a
joro
last
night
they
were
buried
but
not
together
for
the
father
was
not
less
angered
than
grieved
that
such
a
thing
should
have
been
her
name
was
kane
she
was
remarkably
pretty
and
very
gentle
and
from
all
accounts
it
would
seem
that
her
master
had
treated
her
with
a
kindness
unusual
in
men
of
his
infamous
class
she
had
sold
herself
for
the
sake
of
her
mother
and
a
the
father
was
dead
and
they
had
lost
everything
she
was
then
seventeen
she
had
been
in
the
house
scarcely
a
year
when
she
met
the
youth
they
fell
seriously
in
love
with
each
other
at
once
nothing
more
terrible
could
have
befallen
them
for
they
could
never
hope
to
become
man
and
wife
the
young
man
though
still
allowed
the
privileges
of
a
son
had
been
disinherited
in
favour
of
an
adopted
brother
of
steadier
habits
the
unhappy
pair
spent
all
they
had
for
the
privilege
of
seeing
each
other
she
sold
even
her
dresses
to
pay
for
it
then
for
the
last
time
they
met
by
stealth
late
at
night
in
the
physician
house
drank
death
and
laid
down
to
sleep
for
ever
i
saw
the
funeral
procession
of
the
girl
winding
its
way
by
the
light
of
paper
lanterns
the
wan
dead
glow
that
is
like
a
shimmer
of
phosphorescence
to
the
street
of
the
temples
followed
by
a
long
train
of
women
passing
all
soundlessly
a
troop
of
ghosts
so
through
blackness
to
the
meido
the
white
shapes
flit
the
eternal
procession
of
souls
in
painted
buddhist
dreams
of
the
underworld
sec
my
friend
who
writes
for
the
shimbun
which
will
print
the
whole
sad
story
tells
me
that
compassionate
folk
have
already
decked
the
graves
with
flowers
and
with
sprays
of
shikimi
then
drawing
from
a
long
native
envelope
a
long
light
thin
roll
of
paper
covered
with
beautiful
japanese
writing
and
unfolding
it
before
me
he
adds
left
this
letter
to
the
keeper
of
the
house
in
which
she
lived
it
has
been
given
to
us
for
publication
it
is
very
prettily
written
but
i
can
not
translate
it
well
for
it
is
written
in
language
the
language
of
letters
written
by
women
is
not
the
same
as
that
of
letters
written
by
men
women
use
particular
words
and
expressions
for
instance
in
men
language
i
is
watakushi
or
ware
or
yo
or
boku
according
to
rank
or
circumstance
but
in
the
language
of
woman
it
is
warawa
and
women
language
is
very
soft
and
gentle
and
i
do
not
think
it
is
possible
to
translate
such
softness
and
amiability
of
words
into
any
other
language
so
i
can
only
give
you
an
imperfect
idea
of
the
letter
and
he
interprets
slowly
thus
leave
this
letter
you
know
from
last
spring
i
began
to
love
and
he
also
fell
in
love
with
me
and
now
alas
the
influence
of
our
relation
in
some
previous
birth
having
come
upon
us
and
the
promise
we
made
each
other
in
that
former
life
to
become
wife
and
husband
having
been
broken
even
i
must
travel
to
the
meido
not
only
treated
me
very
kindly
though
you
found
me
so
stupid
and
without
influence
but
you
likewise
aided
in
many
ways
for
my
worthless
sake
my
mother
and
sister
and
now
since
i
have
not
been
able
to
repay
you
even
the
one
myriadth
part
of
that
kindness
and
pity
in
which
you
enveloped
me
pity
great
as
the
mountains
and
the
sea
it
would
not
be
without
just
reason
that
you
should
hate
me
as
a
great
criminal
though
i
doubt
not
this
which
i
am
about
to
do
will
seem
a
wicked
folly
i
am
forced
to
it
by
conditions
and
by
my
own
heart
wherefore
i
still
may
pray
you
to
pardon
my
past
faults
and
though
i
go
to
the
meido
never
shall
i
forget
your
mercy
to
me
great
as
the
mountains
and
the
sea
from
under
the
shadow
of
the
grasses
i
shall
still
try
to
recompense
you
to
send
back
my
gratitude
to
you
and
to
your
house
again
with
all
my
heart
i
pray
you
do
not
be
angry
with
me
more
things
i
would
like
to
write
but
now
my
heart
is
not
a
heart
and
i
must
quickly
go
and
so
i
shall
lay
down
my
is
written
so
clumsily
this
thrice
prostrates
herself
before
you
kane
it
is
a
characteristic
shinju
letter
my
friend
comments
after
a
moment
silence
replacing
the
frail
white
paper
in
its
envelope
i
thought
it
would
interest
you
and
now
although
it
is
growing
dark
i
am
going
to
the
cemetery
to
see
what
has
been
done
at
the
grave
would
you
like
to
come
with
me
we
take
our
way
over
the
long
white
bridge
up
the
shadowy
street
of
the
temples
toward
the
ancient
hakaba
of
miokoji
and
the
darkness
grows
as
we
walk
a
thin
moon
hangs
just
above
the
roofs
of
the
great
temples
suddenly
a
far
voice
sonorous
and
sweet
a
man
into
song
under
the
starred
night
a
song
full
of
strange
charm
and
tones
like
warblings
those
japanese
tones
of
popular
emotion
which
seem
to
have
been
learned
from
the
songs
of
birds
some
happy
workman
returning
home
so
clear
the
thin
frosty
air
that
each
syllable
quivers
to
us
but
i
can
not
understand
the
words
saite
yuke
toya
ano
ya
wo
saite
yuke
ba
chikayoru
nushi
no
soba
is
that
i
ask
my
friend
he
answers
go
forward
straight
forward
that
way
to
the
house
that
thou
seest
before
thee
the
nearer
thou
goest
thereto
the
nearer
to
her
shalt
thou
be
chapter
fourteen
sec
unto
which
is
in
the
village
of
sakusa
in
iu
in
the
land
of
izumo
all
youths
and
maidens
go
who
are
in
love
and
who
can
make
the
pilgrimage
for
in
the
temple
of
yaegaki
at
sakusa
and
his
wife
and
their
son
are
enshrined
and
these
are
the
deities
of
wedlock
and
of
love
and
they
set
the
solitary
in
families
and
by
their
doing
are
destinies
coupled
even
from
the
hour
of
birth
wherefore
one
should
suppose
that
to
make
pilgrimage
to
their
temple
to
pray
about
things
long
since
irrevocably
settled
were
simple
waste
of
time
but
in
what
land
did
ever
religious
practice
and
theology
agree
scholiasts
and
priests
create
or
promulgate
doctrine
and
dogma
but
the
good
people
always
insist
upon
making
the
gods
according
to
their
own
heart
and
these
are
by
far
the
better
class
of
gods
moreover
the
history
of
the
impetuous
male
deity
does
not
indicate
that
destiny
had
anything
to
do
with
his
particular
case
he
fell
in
love
with
the
wondrous
inada
princess
at
first
sight
as
it
is
written
in
the
kojiki
descended
to
a
place
called
at
the
headwaters
of
the
river
hi
in
the
land
of
idzumo
at
this
time
a
chopstick
came
floating
down
the
stream
so
thinking
that
there
must
be
people
at
the
headwaters
of
the
river
went
up
it
in
quest
of
them
and
he
came
upon
an
old
man
and
an
old
woman
who
had
a
young
girl
between
them
and
were
weeping
then
he
deigned
to
ask
who
are
ye
so
the
old
man
replied
saying
i
am
an
earthly
deity
son
of
the
deity
i
am
called
by
the
name
of
my
wife
is
called
by
the
name
of
and
my
daughter
is
called
by
the
name
of
again
he
asked
what
is
the
cause
of
your
crying
the
old
man
answered
saying
i
had
originally
eight
young
daughters
but
the
serpent
of
koshi
has
come
every
year
and
devoured
one
and
it
is
now
its
time
to
come
wherefore
we
weep
then
he
asked
him
what
is
its
form
like
the
old
man
answered
saying
its
eyes
are
like
it
has
one
body
with
eight
heads
and
eight
tails
moreover
upon
its
body
grow
moss
and
sugi
and
hinoki
trees
its
length
extends
over
eight
valleys
and
eight
hills
and
if
one
look
at
its
belly
it
is
all
constantly
bloody
and
inflamed
then
said
to
the
old
man
if
this
be
thy
daughter
wilt
thou
offer
her
to
me
he
replied
with
reverence
but
i
know
not
thine
august
name
then
he
replied
saying
i
am
elder
brother
to
so
now
i
have
descended
from
heaven
then
the
deities
and
said
if
that
be
so
with
reverence
will
we
offer
her
to
thee
so
at
once
taking
and
changing
the
young
girl
into
a
comb
which
he
stuck
into
his
august
said
to
the
deities
and
do
you
distil
some
eightfold
refined
liquor
also
make
a
fence
round
about
in
that
fence
make
eight
gates
at
each
gate
tie
a
platform
on
each
platform
put
a
and
into
each
vat
pour
the
eightfold
refined
liquor
and
wait
so
as
they
waited
after
having
prepared
everything
in
accordance
with
his
bidding
the
serpent
came
and
put
a
head
into
each
vat
and
drank
the
liquor
thereupon
it
was
intoxicated
and
all
the
heads
lay
down
and
slept
then
drew
the
sabre
that
was
augustly
girded
upon
him
and
cut
the
serpent
in
pieces
so
that
the
river
hi
flowed
on
changed
into
a
river
of
blood
sought
in
the
land
of
idzumo
where
he
might
build
a
palace
this
great
deity
built
the
palace
clouds
rose
up
thence
then
he
made
an
august
song
tatsu
idzumo
ni
sono
wo
now
the
temple
of
yaegaki
takes
its
name
from
the
words
of
the
august
song
and
therefore
signifies
the
temple
of
the
eightfold
fence
and
ancient
commentators
upon
the
sacred
books
have
said
that
the
name
of
idzumo
which
is
now
izumo
as
signifying
the
land
of
the
issuing
of
clouds
was
also
taken
from
that
song
of
the
god
sec
sakusa
the
hamlet
where
the
stands
is
scarcely
more
than
one
ri
south
from
matsue
but
to
go
there
one
must
follow
tortuous
paths
too
rough
and
steep
for
a
kuruma
and
of
three
ways
the
longest
and
roughest
happens
to
be
the
most
interesting
it
slopes
up
and
down
through
bamboo
groves
and
primitive
woods
and
again
serpentines
through
fields
of
rice
and
barley
and
plantations
of
indigo
and
of
ginseng
where
the
scenery
is
always
beautiful
or
odd
and
there
are
many
famed
shinto
temples
to
be
visited
on
the
road
such
as
dedicated
to
the
venerable
minister
of
the
empress
jingo
to
whom
men
now
pray
for
health
and
for
length
of
years
and
or
of
the
five
greatest
shrines
in
izumo
and
manaijinja
sacred
to
izanagi
the
mother
of
gods
where
strange
pictures
may
be
obtained
of
the
parents
of
the
world
and
where
izanami
is
enshrined
also
called
kamoshijinja
which
means
soul
of
the
god
at
the
temple
of
the
soul
of
the
god
where
the
sacred
used
to
be
delivered
each
year
with
solemn
rites
to
the
great
kokuzo
of
kitzuki
there
are
curious
things
to
be
seen
a
colossal
grain
of
rice
more
than
an
inch
long
preserved
from
that
period
of
the
kamiyo
when
the
rice
grew
tall
as
the
tallest
tree
and
bore
grains
worthy
of
the
gods
and
a
cauldron
of
iron
in
which
the
peasants
say
that
the
first
kokuzo
came
down
from
heaven
and
a
cyclopean
toro
formed
of
rocks
so
huge
that
one
can
not
imagine
how
they
were
ever
balanced
upon
each
other
and
the
musical
stones
of
oba
which
chime
like
bells
when
smitten
there
is
a
tradition
that
these
can
not
be
carried
away
beyond
a
certain
distance
for
is
recorded
that
when
a
daimyo
named
matsudaira
ordered
one
of
them
to
be
conveyed
to
his
castle
at
matsue
the
stone
made
itself
so
heavy
that
a
thousand
men
could
not
move
it
farther
than
the
ohashi
bridge
so
it
was
abandoned
before
the
bridge
and
it
lies
there
imbedded
in
the
soil
even
unto
this
day
all
about
oba
you
may
see
many
sekirei
or
sacred
to
izanami
and
izanagi
for
a
legend
says
that
from
the
sekirei
the
gods
first
learned
the
art
of
love
and
none
not
even
the
most
avaricious
farmer
ever
hurts
or
terrifies
these
birds
so
that
they
do
not
fear
the
people
of
oba
nor
the
scarecrows
in
the
fields
the
god
of
scarecrows
is
sec
the
path
to
sakusa
for
the
last
mile
of
the
journey
at
least
is
extremely
narrow
and
has
been
paved
by
piety
with
large
flat
rocks
laid
upon
the
soil
at
intervals
of
about
a
foot
like
an
interminable
line
of
you
can
not
walk
between
them
nor
beside
them
and
you
soon
tire
of
walking
upon
them
but
they
have
the
merit
of
indicating
the
way
a
matter
of
no
small
importance
where
fifty
paths
branch
off
from
your
own
at
all
bewildering
angles
after
having
been
safely
guided
by
these
through
all
kinds
of
labyrinths
in
rice
valleys
and
bamboo
groves
one
feels
grateful
to
the
peasantry
for
that
of
rocks
there
are
some
quaint
little
shrines
in
the
groves
along
this
path
shrines
with
curious
carvings
of
dragons
and
of
and
flowing
water
all
wrought
ages
ago
in
good
which
has
become
the
colour
of
stone
but
the
eyes
of
the
dragons
and
the
lions
have
been
stolen
because
they
were
made
of
fine
crystal
quartz
and
there
was
none
to
guard
them
and
because
neither
the
laws
nor
the
gods
are
quite
so
much
feared
now
as
they
were
before
the
period
of
meiji
sakusa
is
a
very
small
cluster
of
farmers
cottages
before
a
temple
at
the
verge
of
a
wood
the
temple
of
yaegaki
the
of
the
path
vanish
into
the
pavement
of
the
court
just
before
its
lofty
unpainted
wooden
torii
between
the
torii
and
the
inner
court
entered
by
a
chinese
gate
some
grand
old
trees
are
growing
and
there
are
queer
monuments
to
see
on
either
side
of
the
great
gateway
is
a
shrine
compartment
inclosed
by
heavy
wooden
gratings
on
two
sides
and
in
these
compartments
are
two
grim
figures
in
complete
armour
with
bows
in
their
hands
and
quivers
of
arrows
upon
their
backs
the
zuijin
or
ghostly
retainers
of
the
gods
and
guardians
of
the
gate
before
nearly
all
the
shinto
temples
of
izumo
except
kitzuki
these
zuijin
keep
grim
watch
they
are
probably
of
buddhist
origin
but
they
have
acquired
a
shinto
history
and
shinto
names
originally
i
am
told
there
was
but
one
whose
name
was
but
at
a
certain
period
both
the
god
and
his
name
were
cut
in
two
perhaps
for
decorative
purposes
and
now
he
who
sits
upon
the
left
is
called
and
his
companion
on
the
right
before
the
gate
on
the
left
side
there
is
a
stone
monument
upon
which
is
graven
in
chinese
characters
a
poem
in
hokku
or
verse
of
seventeen
syllables
composed
by
my
companion
translates
the
characters
thus
high
heap
the
dead
leaves
there
is
the
holy
place
upon
the
hills
where
dwell
the
gods
near
by
are
stone
lanterns
and
stone
lions
and
another
monument
a
great
slab
set
up
and
chiselled
bearing
the
names
in
chinese
characters
of
the
or
the
deities
who
protect
the
soil
whose
name
signifies
the
august
who
is
the
scarecrow
god
and
the
figure
of
a
fox
in
stone
sits
before
the
name
of
the
august
the
miya
or
shinto
temple
itself
is
quite
small
smaller
than
most
of
the
temples
in
the
neighbourhood
and
dingy
and
begrimed
with
age
yet
next
to
kitzuki
this
is
the
most
famous
of
izumo
shrines
the
main
shrine
dedicated
to
and
and
their
son
whose
name
is
the
name
of
the
hamlet
of
sakusa
is
flanked
by
various
lesser
shrines
to
left
and
right
in
one
of
these
smaller
miya
the
spirit
of
father
of
is
supposed
to
dwell
and
in
another
that
of
the
mother
of
there
is
also
a
small
shrine
of
the
goddess
of
the
sun
but
these
shrines
have
no
curious
features
the
main
temple
offers
on
the
other
hand
some
displays
of
rarest
interest
to
the
grey
gratings
of
the
doors
of
the
shrine
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
strips
of
soft
white
paper
have
been
tied
in
knots
there
is
nothing
written
upon
them
although
each
represents
a
wish
and
a
fervent
prayer
no
prayers
indeed
are
so
fervent
as
those
of
love
also
there
are
suspended
many
little
sections
of
bamboo
cut
just
below
joints
so
as
to
form
water
receptacles
these
are
tied
together
in
pairs
with
a
small
straw
cord
which
also
serves
to
hang
them
up
they
contain
offerings
of
carried
here
from
no
small
distance
and
mingling
with
the
white
confusion
of
knotted
papers
there
dangle
from
the
gratings
many
tresses
of
girls
hair
and
numerous
offerings
of
seaweed
so
filamentary
and
so
that
at
some
little
distance
it
would
not
be
easy
to
distinguish
them
from
long
shorn
tresses
and
all
the
woodwork
of
the
doors
and
the
gratings
both
beneath
and
between
the
offerings
is
covered
with
a
speckling
of
characters
graven
or
written
which
are
names
of
pilgrims
and
my
companion
reads
aloud
the
name
of
akira
if
one
dare
judge
the
efficacy
of
prayer
to
these
kind
gods
of
shinto
from
the
testimony
of
their
worshippers
i
should
certainly
say
that
akira
has
good
reason
to
hope
planted
in
the
soil
all
round
the
edge
of
the
foundations
of
the
shrine
are
multitudes
of
tiny
paper
flags
of
curious
shape
nobori
pasted
upon
splinters
of
bamboo
each
of
these
little
white
things
is
a
banner
of
victory
and
a
lover
witness
of
gratitude
you
will
find
such
little
flags
stuck
into
the
ground
about
nearly
all
the
great
shinto
temples
of
izumo
at
kitzuki
they
can
not
even
be
counted
any
more
than
the
flakes
of
a
snowstorm
and
here
is
something
else
that
you
will
find
at
most
of
the
famous
miya
in
izumo
a
box
of
little
bamboo
sticks
fastened
to
a
post
before
the
doors
if
you
were
to
count
the
sticks
you
would
find
their
number
to
be
exactly
one
thousand
they
are
counters
for
pilgrims
who
make
a
vow
to
the
gods
to
perform
a
to
perform
a
means
to
visit
the
temple
one
thousand
times
this
however
is
so
hard
to
do
that
busy
pious
men
make
a
sort
of
compromise
with
the
gods
thus
they
walk
from
the
shrine
one
foot
beyond
the
gate
and
back
again
to
the
shrine
one
thousand
times
all
in
one
day
keeping
count
with
the
little
splints
of
bamboo
there
is
one
more
famous
thing
to
be
seen
before
visiting
the
holy
grove
behind
the
temple
and
that
is
the
sacred
or
of
yaegaki
it
stands
upon
a
little
knoll
fortified
by
a
in
a
near
the
house
of
the
priest
a
fence
has
been
built
around
it
and
votive
lamps
of
stone
placed
before
it
it
is
of
vast
age
and
has
two
heads
and
two
feet
but
the
twin
trunks
grow
together
at
the
middle
its
unique
shape
and
the
good
quality
of
longevity
it
is
believed
to
possess
in
common
with
all
of
its
species
cause
it
to
be
revered
as
a
symbol
of
undying
wedded
love
and
as
tenanted
by
the
kami
who
hearken
to
prayers
there
is
however
a
strange
superstition
about
and
this
sacred
tree
of
yaegaki
in
the
opinion
of
some
folk
is
a
rare
exception
to
the
general
ghastliness
of
its
species
for
are
goblin
trees
they
say
and
walk
about
at
night
and
there
was
one
in
the
garden
of
a
matsue
samurai
which
did
this
so
much
that
it
had
to
be
cut
down
then
it
writhed
its
arms
and
groaned
and
blood
spurted
at
every
stroke
of
the
axe
sec
at
the
spacious
residence
of
the
kannushi
some
very
curious
ofuda
and
the
holy
talismans
and
charms
of
yaegaki
are
sold
together
with
pictures
representing
and
his
bride
surrounded
by
the
fence
of
clouds
on
the
pictures
is
also
printed
the
august
song
whence
the
temple
derives
its
name
of
kumo
tatsu
idzumo
of
the
there
is
quite
a
variety
but
by
far
the
most
interesting
is
that
labelled
august
of
the
temple
of
yaegaki
of
izumo
this
oblong
folded
paper
with
chinese
characters
and
the
temple
seal
upon
it
is
purchased
only
by
those
in
love
and
is
believed
to
assure
nothing
more
than
the
desired
union
within
the
paper
are
two
of
the
smallest
conceivable
hina
representing
a
married
couple
in
antique
costume
the
tiny
wife
folded
to
the
breast
of
the
tiny
husband
by
one
arm
it
is
the
duty
of
whoever
purchases
this
mamori
to
return
it
to
the
temple
if
he
or
she
succeed
in
marrying
the
person
beloved
as
already
stated
the
charm
is
not
supposed
to
assure
anything
more
than
the
union
it
can
not
be
accounted
responsible
for
any
consequences
thereof
he
who
desires
perpetual
love
must
purchase
another
mamori
labelled
august
amulet
of
august
of
the
this
charm
should
maintain
at
constant
temperature
the
warmth
of
affection
it
contains
only
a
leaf
of
the
singular
camellia
tree
before
mentioned
there
are
also
small
amulets
for
exciting
love
and
amulets
for
the
expelling
of
diseases
but
these
have
no
special
characteristics
worth
dwelling
upon
then
we
take
our
way
to
the
sacred
grove
the
or
mystic
shades
of
yaegaki
sec
this
ancient
grove
so
dense
that
when
you
first
pass
into
its
shadows
out
of
the
sun
all
seems
black
is
composed
of
colossal
cedars
and
pines
mingled
with
bamboo
tsubaki
camellia
japonica
and
sakaki
the
sacred
and
mystic
tree
of
shinto
the
dimness
is
chiefly
made
by
the
huge
bamboos
in
nearly
all
sacred
groves
bamboos
are
thickly
set
between
the
trees
and
their
feathery
foliage
filling
every
lofty
opening
between
the
heavier
crests
entirely
cuts
off
the
sun
even
in
a
bamboo
grove
where
no
other
trees
are
there
is
always
a
deep
twilight
as
the
eyes
become
accustomed
to
this
green
gloaming
a
pathway
outlines
itself
between
the
trees
a
pathway
wholly
covered
with
moss
velvety
soft
and
beautifully
verdant
in
former
years
when
all
pilgrims
were
required
to
remove
their
footgear
before
entering
the
sacred
grove
this
natural
carpet
was
a
boon
to
the
weary
the
next
detail
one
observes
is
that
the
trunks
of
many
of
the
great
trees
have
been
covered
with
thick
rush
matting
to
a
height
of
seven
or
eight
feet
and
that
holes
have
been
torn
through
some
of
the
mats
all
the
giants
of
the
grove
are
sacred
and
the
matting
was
bound
about
them
to
prevent
pilgrims
from
stripping
off
their
bark
which
is
believed
to
possess
miraculous
virtues
but
many
more
zealous
than
honest
do
not
hesitate
to
tear
away
the
matting
in
order
to
get
at
the
bark
and
the
third
curious
fact
which
you
notice
is
that
the
trunks
of
the
great
bamboos
are
covered
with
ideographs
with
the
wishes
of
lovers
and
the
names
of
girls
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
of
vegetation
so
nice
to
write
a
name
upon
as
the
polished
bark
of
a
bamboo
each
letter
however
lightly
traced
at
first
enlarges
and
blackens
with
the
growth
of
the
bark
and
never
fades
away
the
deeply
mossed
path
slopes
down
to
a
little
pond
in
the
very
heart
of
the
grove
a
pond
famous
in
the
land
of
izumo
here
there
are
many
imori
or
about
five
inches
long
which
have
red
bellies
here
the
shade
is
deepest
and
the
stems
of
the
bamboos
most
thickly
tattooed
with
the
names
of
girls
it
is
believed
that
the
flesh
of
the
newts
in
the
sacred
pond
of
yaegaki
possesses
aphrodisiac
qualities
and
the
body
of
the
creature
reduced
to
ashes
by
burning
was
formerly
converted
into
and
there
is
a
little
japanese
song
referring
to
the
practice
koka
niwa
naika
to
imori
ni
toeba
marumete
kore
bakari
the
water
is
very
clear
and
there
are
many
of
these
newts
to
be
seen
and
it
is
the
custom
for
lovers
to
make
a
little
boat
of
paper
and
put
into
it
one
rin
and
set
it
afloat
and
watch
it
so
soon
as
the
paper
becomes
wet
through
and
allows
the
water
to
enter
it
the
weight
of
the
copper
coin
soon
sends
it
to
the
bottom
where
owing
to
the
purity
of
the
water
it
can
be
still
seen
distinctly
as
before
if
the
newts
then
approach
and
touch
it
the
lovers
believe
their
happiness
assured
by
the
will
of
the
gods
but
if
the
newts
do
not
come
near
it
the
omen
is
evil
one
poor
little
paper
boat
i
observe
could
not
sink
at
all
it
simply
floated
to
the
inaccessible
side
of
the
pond
where
the
trees
rise
like
a
solid
wall
of
trunks
from
the
water
edge
and
there
became
caught
in
some
drooping
branches
the
lover
who
launched
it
must
have
departed
sorrowing
at
heart
close
to
the
pond
near
the
pathway
there
are
many
of
which
the
tips
of
the
branches
have
been
tied
together
by
pairs
with
strips
of
white
paper
these
are
shrubs
of
presage
the
true
lover
must
be
able
to
bend
two
branches
together
and
to
keep
them
united
by
tying
a
paper
tightly
about
them
all
with
the
fingers
of
one
hand
to
do
this
well
is
good
luck
nothing
is
written
upon
the
strips
of
paper
but
there
is
enough
writing
upon
the
bamboos
to
occupy
curiosity
for
many
an
hour
in
spite
of
the
mosquitoes
most
of
the
names
are
that
is
to
say
pretty
names
of
women
but
there
are
likewise
names
of
men
jitsumyo
and
oddly
enough
a
girl
name
and
a
are
in
no
instance
written
together
to
judge
by
all
this
ideographic
testimony
lovers
in
japan
or
at
least
in
izumo
are
even
more
secretive
than
in
our
occident
the
enamoured
youth
never
writes
his
own
jitsumyo
and
his
sweetheart
together
and
the
family
name
or
myoji
he
seldom
ventures
to
inscribe
if
he
writes
his
jitsumyo
then
he
contents
himself
with
whispering
the
of
his
sweetheart
to
the
gods
and
to
the
bamboos
if
he
cuts
her
into
the
bark
then
he
substitutes
for
his
own
name
a
mention
of
his
existence
and
his
age
only
as
in
this
touching
instance
this
lover
presumes
to
write
his
girl
whole
name
but
the
example
so
far
as
i
am
able
to
discover
is
unique
other
enamoured
ones
write
only
the
of
their
bewitchers
and
the
honourable
prefix
and
the
honourable
suffix
find
no
place
in
the
familiarity
of
love
there
is
no
but
there
are
hosts
of
haru
and
kin
and
take
and
kiku
girls
of
course
never
dream
of
writing
their
lovers
names
but
there
are
many
geimyo
here
names
names
of
mischievous
geisha
who
worship
the
golden
kitten
written
by
their
saucy
selves
rakue
and
asa
and
wakai
aikichi
and
kotabuki
and
kohachi
kohana
and
tamakichi
and
katsuko
and
asakichi
and
hanakichi
and
katsukichi
and
chiyoe
and
chiyotsuru
and
such
are
their
appellations
and
and
and
and
and
and
and
victory
and
often
shall
he
curse
the
day
he
was
born
who
falls
in
love
with
thrice
unlucky
the
wight
bewitched
by
the
woe

sec
by
every
shady
wayside
and
in
every
ancient
grove
on
almost
every
hilltop
and
in
the
outskirts
of
every
village
you
may
see
while
travelling
through
the
hondo
country
some
little
shinto
shrine
before
which
or
at
either
side
of
which
are
images
of
seated
foxes
in
stone
usually
there
is
a
pair
of
these
facing
each
other
but
there
may
be
a
dozen
or
a
score
or
several
hundred
in
which
case
most
of
the
images
are
very
small
and
in
more
than
one
of
the
larger
towns
you
may
see
in
the
court
of
some
great
miya
a
countless
host
of
stone
foxes
of
all
dimensions
from
but
a
few
inches
high
to
the
colossi
whose
pedestals
tower
above
your
head
all
squatting
around
the
temple
in
tiered
ranks
of
thousands
such
shrines
and
temples
everybody
knows
are
dedicated
to
inari
the
god
of
rice
after
having
travelled
much
in
japan
you
will
find
that
whenever
you
try
to
recall
any
you
have
visited
there
will
appear
in
some
nook
or
corner
of
that
remembrance
a
pair
of
foxes
of
stone
with
broken
noses
in
my
own
memories
of
japanese
travel
these
shapes
have
become
de
rigueur
as
picturesque
detail
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
capital
and
in
tokyo
itself
sometimes
in
the
cemeteries
very
beautiful
idealised
figures
of
foxes
may
be
seen
elegant
as
greyhounds
they
have
long
green
or
grey
eyes
of
crystal
quartz
or
some
other
diaphanous
substance
and
they
create
a
strong
impression
as
mythological
conceptions
but
throughout
the
interior
are
much
less
artistically
fashioned
in
izumo
particularly
such
has
a
decidedly
primitive
appearance
there
is
an
astonishing
multiplicity
and
variety
of
in
the
province
of
the
gods
images
comical
quaint
grotesque
or
monstrous
but
for
the
most
part
very
rudely
chiselled
i
can
not
however
declare
them
less
interesting
on
that
account
the
work
of
the
tokkaido
sculptor
copies
the
conventional
artistic
notion
of
light
grace
and
ghostliness
the
rustic
foxes
of
izumo
have
no
grace
they
are
uncouth
but
they
betray
in
countless
queer
ways
the
personal
fancies
of
their
makers
they
are
of
many
moods
whimsical
apathetic
inquisitive
saturnine
jocose
ironical
they
watch
and
snooze
and
squint
and
wink
and
sneer
they
wait
with
lurking
smiles
they
listen
with
cocked
ears
most
stealthily
keeping
their
mouths
open
or
closed
there
is
an
amusing
individuality
about
them
all
and
an
air
of
knowing
mockery
about
most
of
them
even
those
whose
noses
have
been
broken
off
moreover
these
ancient
country
foxes
have
certain
natural
beauties
which
their
modern
tokyo
kindred
can
not
show
time
has
bestowed
upon
them
divers
speckled
coats
of
beautiful
soft
colours
while
they
have
been
sitting
on
their
pedestals
listening
to
the
ebbing
and
flowing
of
the
centuries
and
snickering
weirdly
at
mankind
their
backs
are
clad
with
finest
green
velvet
of
old
mosses
their
limbs
are
spotted
and
their
tails
are
tipped
with
the
dead
gold
or
the
dead
silver
of
delicate
fungi
and
the
places
they
most
haunt
are
the
loveliest
high
shadowy
groves
where
the
uguisu
sings
in
green
twilight
above
some
voiceless
shrine
with
its
lamps
and
its
lions
of
stone
so
mossed
as
to
seem
things
born
of
the
soil
like
mushrooms
i
found
it
difficult
to
understand
why
out
of
every
thousand
foxes
nine
hundred
should
have
broken
noses
the
main
street
of
the
city
of
matsue
might
be
paved
from
end
to
end
with
the
tips
of
the
noses
of
mutilated
izumo
foxes
a
friend
answered
my
expression
of
wonder
in
this
regard
by
the
simple
but
suggestive
word
which
means
children
sec
inari
the
name
by
which
the
is
generally
known
signifies
but
the
antique
name
of
the
deity
is
the
he
is
the
of
the
kojiki
in
much
more
recent
times
only
has
he
borne
the
name
that
indicates
his
connection
with
the
or
the
indeed
the
conception
of
the
fox
as
a
supernatural
being
does
not
seem
to
have
been
introduced
into
japan
before
the
tenth
or
eleventh
century
and
although
a
shrine
of
the
deity
with
statues
of
foxes
may
be
found
in
the
court
of
most
of
the
large
shinto
temples
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
in
all
the
vast
domains
of
the
oldest
shinto
shrine
in
japan
kitzuki
you
can
not
find
the
image
of
a
fox
and
it
is
only
in
modern
art
the
art
of
toyokuni
and
others
that
inari
is
represented
as
a
bearded
man
riding
a
white
fox
inari
is
not
worshipped
as
the
god
of
rice
only
indeed
there
are
many
inari
just
as
in
antique
greece
there
were
many
deities
called
hermes
zeus
athena
poseidon
one
in
the
knowledge
of
the
learned
but
essentially
different
in
the
imagination
of
the
common
people
inari
has
been
multiplied
by
reason
of
his
different
attributes
for
instance
matsue
has
a
who
is
the
god
of
coughs
and
bad
colds
afflictions
extremely
common
and
remarkably
severe
in
the
land
of
izumo
he
has
a
temple
in
the
kamachi
at
which
he
is
worshipped
under
the
vulgar
appellation
of
and
the
politer
one
of
and
those
who
are
cured
of
their
coughs
and
colds
after
having
prayed
to
him
bring
to
his
temple
offerings
of
tofu
at
oba
likewise
there
is
a
particular
inari
of
great
fame
fastened
to
the
wall
of
his
shrine
is
a
large
box
full
of
small
clay
foxes
the
pilgrim
who
has
a
prayer
to
make
puts
one
of
these
little
foxes
in
his
sleeve
and
carries
it
home
he
must
keep
it
and
pay
it
all
due
honour
until
such
time
as
his
petition
has
been
granted
then
he
must
take
it
back
to
the
temple
and
restore
it
to
the
box
and
if
he
be
able
make
some
small
gift
to
the
shrine
inari
is
often
worshipped
as
a
healer
and
still
more
frequently
as
a
deity
having
power
to
give
wealth
perhaps
because
all
the
wealth
of
old
japan
was
reckoned
in
koku
of
rice
therefore
his
foxes
are
sometimes
represented
holding
keys
in
their
mouths
and
from
being
the
deity
who
gives
wealth
inari
has
also
become
in
some
localities
the
special
divinity
of
the
joro
class
there
is
for
example
an
inari
temple
worth
visiting
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
yoshiwara
at
yokohama
it
stands
in
the
same
court
with
a
temple
of
benten
and
is
more
than
usually
large
for
a
shrine
of
inari
you
approach
it
through
a
succession
of
torii
one
behind
the
other
they
are
of
different
heights
diminishing
in
size
as
they
are
placed
nearer
to
the
temple
and
planted
more
and
more
closely
in
proportion
to
their
smallness
before
each
torii
sit
a
pair
of
weird
foxes
one
to
the
right
and
one
to
the
left
the
first
pair
are
large
as
greyhounds
the
second
two
are
much
smaller
and
the
sizes
of
the
rest
lessen
as
the
dimensions
of
the
torii
lessen
at
the
foot
of
the
wooden
steps
of
the
temple
there
is
a
pair
of
very
graceful
foxes
of
dark
grey
stone
wearing
pieces
of
red
cloth
about
their
necks
upon
the
steps
themselves
are
white
wooden
foxes
one
at
each
end
of
each
step
each
successive
pair
being
smaller
than
the
pair
below
and
at
the
threshold
of
the
doorway
are
two
very
little
foxes
not
more
than
three
inches
high
sitting
on
pedestals
these
have
the
tips
of
their
tails
gilded
then
if
you
look
into
the
temple
you
will
see
on
the
left
something
like
a
long
low
table
on
which
are
placed
thousands
of
tiny
even
smaller
than
those
in
the
doorway
having
only
plain
white
tails
there
is
no
image
of
inari
indeed
i
have
never
seen
an
image
of
inari
as
yet
in
any
inari
temple
on
the
altar
appear
the
usual
emblems
of
shinto
and
before
it
just
opposite
the
doorway
stands
a
sort
of
lantern
having
glass
sides
and
a
wooden
bottom
studded
with
on
which
to
fix
votive
candles
and
here
from
time
to
time
if
you
will
watch
you
will
probably
see
more
than
one
handsome
girl
with
brightly
painted
lips
and
the
beautiful
antique
attire
that
no
maiden
or
wife
may
wear
come
to
the
foot
of
the
steps
toss
a
coin
into
the
at
the
door
and
call
out
which
means
honourable
candle
immediately
from
an
inner
chamber
some
old
man
will
enter
the
with
a
lighted
candle
stick
it
upon
a
in
the
lantern
and
then
retire
such
are
always
accompanied
by
secret
prayers
for
but
this
inari
is
worshipped
by
many
besides
members
of
the
joro
class
the
pieces
of
coloured
cloth
about
the
necks
of
the
foxes
are
also
votive
offerings
sec
in
izumo
seem
to
be
more
numerous
than
in
other
provinces
and
they
are
symbols
there
so
far
as
the
mass
of
the
peasantry
is
concerned
of
something
else
besides
the
worship
of
the
indeed
the
old
conception
of
the
deity
of
has
been
overshadowed
and
almost
effaced
among
the
lowest
classes
by
a
weird
cult
totally
foreign
to
the
spirit
of
pure
shinto
the
the
worship
of
the
retainer
has
almost
replaced
the
worship
of
the
god
originally
the
fox
was
sacred
to
inari
only
as
the
tortoise
is
still
sacred
to
kompira
the
deer
to
the
great
deity
of
kasuga
the
rat
to
daikoku
the
to
ebisu
the
white
serpent
to
benten
or
the
centipede
to
bishamon
god
of
battles
but
in
the
course
of
centuries
the
fox
usurped
divinity
and
the
stone
images
of
him
are
not
the
only
outward
evidences
of
his
cult
at
the
rear
of
almost
every
inari
temple
you
will
generally
find
in
the
wall
of
the
shrine
building
one
or
two
feet
above
the
ground
an
aperture
about
eight
inches
in
diameter
and
perfectly
circular
it
is
often
made
so
as
to
be
closed
at
will
by
a
sliding
plank
this
circular
orifice
is
a
and
if
you
find
one
open
and
look
within
you
will
probably
see
offerings
of
tofu
or
other
food
which
foxes
are
supposed
to
be
fond
of
you
will
also
most
likely
find
grains
of
rice
scattered
on
some
little
projection
of
woodwork
below
or
near
the
hole
or
placed
on
the
edge
of
the
hole
itself
and
you
may
see
some
peasant
clap
his
hands
before
the
hole
utter
some
little
prayer
and
swallow
a
grain
or
two
of
that
rice
in
the
belief
that
it
will
either
cure
or
prevent
sickness
now
the
fox
for
whom
such
a
hole
is
made
is
an
invisible
fox
a
phantom
fox
the
fox
respectfully
referred
to
by
the
peasant
as
if
he
ever
suffers
himself
to
become
visible
his
colour
is
said
to
be
snowy
white
according
to
some
there
are
various
kinds
of
ghostly
foxes
according
to
others
there
are
two
sorts
of
foxes
only
the
and
the
wild
fox
kitsune
some
people
again
class
foxes
into
superior
and
inferior
foxes
and
allege
the
existence
of
four
superior
sorts
byakko
kokko
jenko
and
reiko
all
of
which
possess
supernatural
powers
others
again
count
only
three
kinds
of
foxes
the
the
and
the
but
many
confound
the
or
wild
fox
with
the
and
others
identify
the
with
the
one
can
not
possibly
unravel
the
confusion
of
these
beliefs
especially
among
the
peasantry
the
beliefs
vary
moreover
in
different
districts
i
have
only
been
able
after
a
residence
of
fourteen
months
in
izumo
where
the
superstition
is
especially
strong
and
marked
by
certain
unique
features
to
make
the
following
very
loose
summary
of
them
all
foxes
have
supernatural
power
there
are
good
and
bad
foxes
the
is
good
and
the
bad
foxes
are
afraid
of
the
the
worst
fox
is
the
ninko
or
this
is
especially
the
fox
of
demoniacal
possession
it
is
no
larger
than
a
weasel
and
somewhat
similar
in
shape
except
for
its
tail
which
is
like
the
tail
of
any
other
fox
it
is
rarely
seen
keeping
itself
invisible
except
to
those
to
whom
it
attaches
itself
it
likes
to
live
in
the
houses
of
men
and
to
be
nourished
by
them
and
to
the
homes
where
it
is
well
cared
for
it
will
bring
prosperity
it
will
take
care
that
the
shall
never
want
for
water
nor
the
for
rice
but
if
offended
it
will
bring
misfortune
to
the
household
and
ruin
to
the
crops
the
wild
fox
nogitsune
is
also
bad
it
also
sometimes
takes
possession
of
people
but
it
is
especially
a
wizard
and
prefers
to
deceive
by
enchantment
it
has
the
power
of
assuming
any
shape
and
of
making
itself
invisible
but
the
dog
can
always
see
it
so
that
it
is
extremely
afraid
of
the
dog
moreover
while
assuming
another
shape
if
its
shadow
fall
upon
water
the
water
will
only
reflect
the
shadow
of
a
fox
the
peasantry
kill
it
but
he
who
kills
a
fox
incurs
the
risk
of
being
bewitched
by
that
fox
kindred
or
even
by
the
ki
or
ghost
of
the
fox
still
if
one
eat
the
flesh
of
a
fox
he
can
not
be
enchanted
afterwards
the
nogitsune
also
enters
houses
most
families
having
foxes
in
their
houses
have
only
the
small
kind
or
ninko
but
occasionally
both
kinds
will
live
together
under
the
same
roof
some
people
say
that
if
the
nogitsune
lives
a
hundred
years
it
becomes
all
white
and
then
takes
rank
as
an
there
are
curious
contradictions
involved
in
these
beliefs
and
other
contradictions
will
be
found
in
the
following
pages
of
this
sketch
to
define
the
at
all
is
difficult
not
only
on
account
of
the
confusion
of
ideas
on
the
subject
among
the
believers
themselves
but
also
on
account
of
the
variety
of
elements
out
of
which
it
has
been
shapen
its
origin
is
chinese
but
in
japan
it
became
oddly
blended
with
the
worship
of
a
shinto
deity
and
again
modified
and
expanded
by
the
buddhist
concepts
of
thaumaturgy
and
magic
so
far
as
the
common
people
are
concerned
it
is
perhaps
safe
to
say
that
they
pay
devotion
to
foxes
chiefly
because
they
fear
them
the
peasant
still
worships
what
he
fears
sec
it
is
more
than
doubtful
whether
the
popular
notions
about
different
classes
of
foxes
and
about
the
distinction
between
the
fox
of
inari
and
the
fox
of
possession
were
ever
much
more
clearly
established
than
they
are
now
except
in
the
books
of
old
literati
indeed
there
exists
a
letter
from
hideyoshi
to
the
which
would
seem
to
show
that
in
the
time
of
the
great
taiko
the
and
the
demon
fox
were
considered
identical
this
letter
is
still
preserved
at
nara
in
the
buddhist
temple
called
todaiji
kyoto
the
seventeenth
day
of
the
third
month
to
inari
daimyojin
my
lord
i
have
the
honour
to
inform
you
that
one
of
the
foxes
under
your
jurisdiction
has
bewitched
one
of
my
servants
causing
her
and
others
a
great
deal
of
trouble
i
have
to
request
that
you
will
make
minute
inquiries
into
the
matter
and
endeavour
to
find
out
the
reason
of
your
subject
misbehaving
in
this
way
and
let
me
know
the
result
if
it
turns
out
that
the
fox
has
no
adequate
reason
to
give
for
his
behaviour
you
are
to
arrest
and
punish
him
at
once
if
you
hesitate
to
take
action
in
this
matter
i
shall
issue
orders
for
the
destruction
of
every
fox
in
the
land
any
other
particulars
that
you
may
wish
to
be
informed
of
in
reference
to
what
has
occurred
you
can
learn
from
the
yoshida
apologising
for
the
imperfections
of
this
letter
i
have
the
honour
to
be
your
obedient
servant
hideyoshi
taiko
but
there
certainly
were
some
distinctions
established
in
localities
owing
to
the
worship
of
inari
by
the
military
caste
with
the
samurai
of
izumo
the
for
obvious
reasons
was
a
highly
popular
deity
and
you
can
still
find
in
the
garden
of
almost
every
old
shizoku
residence
in
matsue
a
small
shrine
of
inari
daimyojin
with
little
stone
foxes
seated
before
it
and
in
the
imagination
of
the
lower
classes
all
samurai
families
possessed
foxes
but
the
samurai
foxes
inspired
no
fear
they
were
believed
to
be
foxes
and
the
superstition
of
the
ninko
or
does
not
seem
to
have
unpleasantly
affected
any
samurai
families
of
matsue
during
the
feudal
era
it
is
only
since
the
military
caste
has
been
abolished
and
its
name
simply
as
a
body
of
gentry
changed
to
shizoku
that
some
families
have
become
victims
of
the
superstition
through
intermarriage
with
the
chonin
or
mercantile
classes
among
whom
the
belief
has
always
been
strong
by
the
peasantry
the
matsudaira
daimyo
of
izumo
were
supposed
to
be
the
greatest
one
of
them
was
believed
to
use
foxes
as
messengers
to
tokyo
be
it
observed
that
a
fox
can
travel
according
to
popular
credence
from
yokohama
to
london
in
a
few
hours
and
there
is
some
matsue
story
about
a
fox
having
been
caught
in
a
trap
near
tokyo
attached
to
whose
neck
was
a
letter
written
by
the
prince
of
izumo
only
the
same
morning
the
great
inari
temple
of
inari
in
the
castle
grounds
with
its
thousands
upon
thousands
of
foxes
of
stone
is
considered
by
the
country
people
a
striking
proof
of
the
devotion
of
the
matsudaira
not
to
inari
but
to
foxes
at
present
however
it
is
no
longer
possible
to
establish
distinctions
of
genera
in
this
ghostly
zoology
where
each
species
grows
into
every
other
it
is
not
even
possible
to
disengage
the
ki
or
soul
of
the
fox
and
the
from
the
confusion
in
which
both
have
become
hopelessly
blended
under
the
name
inari
by
the
vague
conception
of
their
the
old
shinto
mythology
is
indeed
quite
explicit
about
the
and
quite
silent
upon
the
subject
of
foxes
but
the
peasantry
in
izumo
like
the
peasantry
of
catholic
europe
make
mythology
for
themselves
if
asked
whether
they
pray
to
inari
as
to
an
evil
or
a
good
deity
they
will
tell
you
that
inari
is
good
and
that
are
good
they
will
tell
you
of
white
foxes
and
dark
foxes
of
foxes
to
be
reverenced
and
foxes
to
be
killed
of
the
good
fox
which
cries
and
the
evil
fox
which
cries
but
the
peasant
possessed
by
the
fox
cries
out
am
inari
or
some
other
inari
sec
goblin
foxes
are
peculiarly
dreaded
in
izumo
for
three
evil
habits
attributed
to
them
the
first
is
that
of
deceiving
people
by
enchantment
either
for
revenge
or
pure
mischief
the
second
is
that
of
quartering
themselves
as
retainers
upon
some
family
and
thereby
making
that
family
a
terror
to
its
neighbours
the
third
and
worst
is
that
of
entering
into
people
and
taking
diabolical
possession
of
them
and
tormenting
them
into
madness
this
affliction
is
called
the
favourite
shape
assumed
by
the
goblin
fox
for
the
purpose
of
deluding
mankind
is
that
of
a
beautiful
woman
much
less
frequently
the
form
of
a
young
man
is
taken
in
order
to
deceive
some
one
of
the
other
sex
innumerable
are
the
stories
told
or
written
about
the
wiles
of
and
a
dangerous
woman
of
that
class
whose
art
is
to
enslave
men
and
strip
them
of
all
they
possess
is
popularly
named
by
a
word
of
deadly
insult
kitsune
many
declare
that
the
fox
never
really
assumes
human
shape
but
that
he
only
deceives
people
into
the
belief
that
he
does
so
by
a
sort
of
magnetic
power
or
by
spreading
about
them
a
certain
magical
effluvium
the
fox
does
not
always
appear
in
the
guise
of
a
woman
for
evil
purposes
there
are
several
stories
and
one
really
pretty
play
about
a
fox
who
took
the
shape
of
a
beautiful
woman
and
married
a
man
and
bore
him
children
all
out
of
gratitude
for
some
favour
received
the
happiness
of
the
family
being
only
disturbed
by
some
odd
carnivorous
propensities
on
the
part
of
the
offspring
merely
to
achieve
a
diabolical
purpose
the
form
of
a
woman
is
not
always
the
best
disguise
there
are
men
quite
insusceptible
to
feminine
witchcraft
but
the
fox
is
never
at
a
loss
for
a
disguise
he
can
assume
more
forms
than
proteus
furthermore
he
can
make
you
see
or
hear
or
imagine
whatever
he
wishes
you
to
see
hear
or
imagine
he
can
make
you
see
out
of
time
and
space
he
can
recall
the
past
and
reveal
the
future
his
power
has
not
been
destroyed
by
the
introduction
of
western
ideas
for
did
he
not
only
a
few
years
ago
cause
phantom
trains
to
run
upon
the
tokkaido
railway
thereby
greatly
confounding
and
terrifying
the
engineers
of
the
company
but
like
all
goblins
he
prefers
to
haunt
solitary
places
at
night
he
is
fond
of
making
queer
ghostly
lights
in
semblance
of
flit
about
dangerous
places
and
to
protect
yourself
from
this
trick
of
his
it
is
necessary
to
learn
that
by
joining
your
hands
in
a
particular
way
so
as
to
leave
a
aperture
between
the
crossed
fingers
you
can
extinguish
the
at
any
distance
simply
by
blowing
through
the
aperture
in
the
direction
of
the
light
and
uttering
a
certain
buddhist
formula
but
it
is
not
only
at
night
that
the
fox
manifests
his
power
for
mischief
at
high
noon
he
may
tempt
you
to
go
where
you
are
sure
to
get
killed
or
frighten
you
into
going
by
creating
some
apparition
or
making
you
imagine
that
you
feel
an
earthquake
consequently
the
peasant
on
seeing
anything
extremely
queer
is
slow
to
credit
the
testimony
of
his
own
eyes
the
most
interesting
and
valuable
witness
of
the
stupendous
eruption
of
in
which
blew
the
huge
volcano
to
pieces
and
devastated
an
area
of
square
miles
levelling
forests
turning
rivers
from
their
courses
and
burying
numbers
of
villages
with
all
their
inhabitants
was
an
old
peasant
who
had
watched
the
whole
cataclysm
from
a
neighbouring
peak
as
unconcernedly
as
if
he
had
been
looking
at
a
drama
he
saw
a
black
column
of
ashes
and
steam
rise
to
the
height
of
twenty
thousand
feet
and
spread
out
at
its
summit
in
the
shape
of
an
umbrella
blotting
out
the
sun
then
he
felt
a
strange
rain
pouring
upon
him
hotter
than
the
water
of
a
bath
then
all
became
black
and
he
felt
the
mountain
beneath
him
shaking
to
its
roots
and
heard
a
crash
of
thunders
that
seemed
like
the
sound
of
the
breaking
of
a
world
but
he
remained
quite
still
until
everything
was
over
he
had
made
up
his
mind
not
to
be
afraid
deeming
that
all
he
saw
and
heard
was
delusion
wrought
by
the
witchcraft
of
a
fox
sec
strange
is
the
madness
of
those
into
whom
demon
foxes
enter
sometimes
they
run
naked
shouting
through
the
streets
sometimes
they
lie
down
and
froth
at
the
mouth
and
yelp
as
a
fox
yelps
and
on
some
part
of
the
body
of
the
possessed
a
moving
lump
appears
under
the
skin
which
seems
to
have
a
life
of
its
own
prick
it
with
a
needle
and
it
glides
instantly
to
another
place
by
no
grasp
can
it
be
so
tightly
compressed
by
a
strong
hand
that
it
will
not
slip
from
under
the
fingers
possessed
folk
are
also
said
to
speak
and
write
languages
of
which
they
were
totally
ignorant
prior
to
possession
they
eat
only
what
foxes
are
believed
to
like
tofu
aburage
azukimeshi
and
they
eat
a
great
deal
alleging
that
not
they
but
the
possessing
foxes
are
hungry
it
not
infrequently
happens
that
the
victims
of
are
cruelly
treated
by
their
relatives
being
severely
burned
and
beaten
in
the
hope
that
the
fox
may
be
thus
driven
away
then
the
hoin
or
yamabushi
is
sent
for
the
exorciser
the
exorciser
argues
with
the
fox
who
speaks
through
the
mouth
of
the
possessed
when
the
fox
is
reduced
to
silence
by
religious
argument
upon
the
wickedness
of
possessing
people
he
usually
agrees
to
go
away
on
condition
of
being
supplied
with
plenty
of
tofu
or
other
food
and
the
food
promised
must
be
brought
immediately
to
that
particular
inari
temple
of
which
the
fox
declares
himself
a
retainer
for
the
possessing
fox
by
whomsoever
sent
usually
confesses
himself
the
servant
of
a
certain
inari
though
sometimes
even
calling
himself
the
god
as
soon
as
the
possessed
has
been
freed
from
the
possessor
he
falls
down
senseless
and
remains
for
a
long
time
prostrate
and
it
is
said
also
that
he
who
has
once
been
possessed
by
a
fox
will
never
again
be
able
to
eat
tofu
aburage
azukimeshi
or
any
of
those
things
which
foxes
like
sec
it
is
believed
that
the
can
not
be
seen
but
if
he
goes
close
to
still
water
his
shadow
can
be
seen
in
the
water
those
foxes
are
therefore
supposed
to
avoid
the
vicinity
of
rivers
and
ponds
the
invisible
fox
as
already
stated
attaches
himself
to
persons
like
a
japanese
servant
he
belongs
to
the
household
but
if
a
daughter
of
that
household
marry
the
fox
not
only
goes
to
that
new
family
following
the
bride
but
also
colonises
his
kind
in
all
those
families
related
by
marriage
or
kinship
with
the
husband
family
now
every
fox
is
supposed
to
have
a
family
of
neither
more
nor
less
than
and
all
these
must
be
fed
so
that
although
such
foxes
like
ghosts
eat
very
little
individually
it
is
expensive
to
have
foxes
the
must
feed
their
foxes
at
regular
hours
and
the
foxes
always
eat
first
all
the
as
soon
as
the
family
rice
is
cooked
in
the
kama
a
great
iron
the
taps
loudly
on
the
side
of
the
vessel
and
uncovers
it
then
the
foxes
rise
up
through
the
floor
and
although
their
eating
is
soundless
to
human
ear
and
invisible
to
human
eye
the
rice
slowly
diminishes
wherefore
it
is
fearful
for
a
poor
man
to
have
foxes
but
the
cost
of
nourishing
foxes
is
the
least
evil
connected
with
the
keeping
of
them
foxes
have
no
fixed
code
of
ethics
and
have
proved
themselves
untrustworthy
servants
they
may
initiate
and
long
maintain
the
prosperity
of
some
family
but
should
some
grave
misfortune
fall
upon
that
family
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
its
invisible
retainers
then
these
will
suddenly
flee
away
taking
all
the
valuables
of
the
household
along
with
them
and
all
the
fine
gifts
that
foxes
bring
to
their
masters
are
things
which
have
been
stolen
from
somebody
else
it
is
therefore
extremely
immoral
to
keep
foxes
it
is
also
dangerous
for
the
public
peace
inasmuch
as
a
fox
being
a
goblin
and
devoid
of
human
susceptibilities
will
not
take
certain
precautions
he
may
steal
the
neighbour
purse
by
night
and
lay
it
at
his
own
master
threshold
so
that
if
the
neighbour
happens
to
get
up
first
and
see
it
there
is
sure
to
be
a
row
another
evil
habit
of
foxes
is
that
of
making
public
what
they
hear
said
in
private
and
taking
it
upon
themselves
to
create
undesirable
scandal
for
example
a
fox
attached
to
the
family
of
hears
his
master
complain
about
his
neighbour
whom
he
secretly
dislikes
therewith
the
zealous
retainer
runs
to
the
house
of
and
enters
into
his
body
and
torments
him
grievously
saying
am
the
retainer
of
to
whom
you
did
a
wrong
and
until
such
time
as
he
command
me
to
depart
i
shall
continue
to
torment
you
and
last
but
worst
of
all
the
risks
of
possessing
foxes
is
the
danger
that
they
may
become
wroth
with
some
member
of
the
family
certainly
a
fox
may
be
a
good
friend
and
make
rich
the
home
in
which
he
is
domiciled
but
as
he
is
not
human
and
as
his
motives
and
feelings
are
not
those
of
men
but
of
goblins
it
is
difficult
to
avoid
incurring
his
displeasure
at
the
most
unexpected
moment
he
may
take
offence
without
any
cause
knowingly
having
been
given
and
there
is
no
saying
what
the
consequences
may
be
for
the
fox
possesses
instinctive
infinite
vision
and
the
or
ear
and
the
which
is
the
knowledge
of
the
most
secret
thoughts
of
others
and
which
is
the
knowledge
of
the
past
and
which
means
the
knowledge
of
the
universal
present
and
also
the
powers
of
transformation
and
of
transmutation
so
that
even
without
including
his
special
powers
of
bewitchment
he
is
by
nature
a
being
almost
omnipotent
for
evil
sec
for
all
these
reasons
and
doubtless
many
more
people
believed
to
have
foxes
are
shunned
intermarriage
with
a
family
is
out
of
the
question
and
many
a
beautiful
and
accomplished
girl
in
izumo
can
not
secure
a
husband
because
of
the
popular
belief
that
her
family
harbours
foxes
as
a
rule
izumo
girls
do
not
like
to
marry
out
of
their
own
province
but
the
daughters
of
a
must
either
marry
into
the
family
of
another
or
find
a
husband
far
away
from
the
province
of
the
gods
rich
families
have
not
overmuch
difficulty
in
disposing
of
their
daughters
by
one
of
the
means
above
indicated
but
many
a
fine
sweet
girl
of
the
poorer
is
condemned
by
superstition
to
remain
unwedded
it
is
not
because
there
are
none
to
love
her
and
desirous
of
marrying
her
young
men
who
have
passed
through
public
schools
and
who
do
not
believe
in
foxes
it
is
because
popular
superstition
can
not
be
yet
safely
defied
in
country
districts
except
by
the
wealthy
the
consequences
of
such
defiance
would
have
to
be
borne
not
merely
by
the
husband
but
by
his
whole
family
and
by
all
other
families
related
thereunto
which
are
consequences
to
be
thought
about
among
men
believed
to
have
foxes
there
are
some
who
know
how
to
turn
the
superstition
to
good
account
the
as
a
general
rule
are
afraid
of
giving
offence
to
a
lest
he
should
send
some
of
his
invisible
servants
to
take
possession
of
them
accordingly
certain
have
obtained
great
ascendancy
over
the
communities
in
which
they
live
in
the
town
of
yonago
for
example
there
is
a
certain
prosperous
chonin
whose
will
is
almost
law
and
whose
opinions
are
never
opposed
he
is
practically
the
ruler
of
the
place
and
in
a
fair
way
of
becoming
a
very
wealthy
man
all
because
he
is
thought
to
have
foxes
wrestlers
as
a
class
boast
of
their
immunity
from
and
care
neither
for
nor
for
their
spectral
friends
very
strong
men
are
believed
to
be
proof
against
all
such
goblinry
foxes
are
said
to
be
afraid
of
them
and
instances
are
cited
of
a
possessing
fox
declaring
wished
to
enter
into
your
brother
but
he
was
too
strong
for
me
so
i
have
entered
into
you
as
i
am
resolved
to
be
revenged
upon
some
one
of
your
family
sec
now
the
belief
in
foxes
does
not
affect
persons
only
it
affects
property
it
affects
the
value
of
real
estate
in
izumo
to
the
amount
of
hundreds
of
thousands
the
land
of
a
family
supposed
to
have
foxes
can
not
be
sold
at
a
fair
price
people
are
afraid
to
buy
it
for
it
is
believed
the
foxes
may
ruin
the
new
proprietor
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
a
purchaser
is
most
great
in
the
case
of
land
terraced
for
in
the
mountain
districts
the
prime
necessity
of
such
agriculture
is
irrigation
irrigation
by
a
hundred
ingenious
devices
always
in
the
face
of
difficulties
there
are
seasons
when
water
becomes
terribly
scarce
and
when
the
peasants
will
even
fight
for
water
it
is
feared
that
on
lands
haunted
by
foxes
the
foxes
may
turn
the
water
away
from
one
field
into
another
or
for
spite
make
holes
in
the
dikes
and
so
destroy
the
crop
there
are
not
wanting
shrewd
men
to
take
advantage
of
this
queer
belief
one
gentleman
of
matsue
a
good
agriculturist
of
the
modern
school
speculated
in
the
fifteen
years
ago
and
purchased
a
vast
tract
of
land
in
eastern
izumo
which
no
one
else
would
bid
for
that
land
has
sextupled
in
value
besides
yielding
generously
under
his
system
of
cultivation
and
by
selling
it
now
he
could
realise
an
immense
fortune
his
success
and
the
fact
of
his
having
been
an
official
of
the
government
broke
the
spell
it
is
no
longer
believed
that
his
farms
are
but
success
alone
could
not
have
freed
the
soil
from
the
curse
of
the
superstition
the
power
of
the
farmer
to
banish
the
foxes
was
due
to
his
official
character
with
the
peasantry
the
word
is
talismanic
indeed
the
richest
and
the
most
successful
farmer
of
izumo
worth
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
yen
of
chinomiya
in
kandegori
is
almost
universally
believed
by
the
peasantry
to
be
a
they
tell
curious
stories
about
him
some
say
that
when
a
very
poor
man
he
found
in
the
woods
one
day
a
little
white
and
took
it
home
and
petted
it
and
gave
it
plenty
of
tofu
azukimeshi
and
aburage
three
sorts
of
food
which
foxes
love
and
that
from
that
day
prosperity
came
to
him
others
say
that
in
his
house
there
is
a
special
zashiki
or
for
foxes
and
that
there
once
in
each
month
a
great
banquet
is
given
to
hundreds
of
but
as
they
call
him
can
afford
to
laugh
at
all
these
tales
he
is
a
refined
man
highly
respected
in
cultivated
circles
where
superstition
never
enters
sec
when
a
ninko
comes
to
your
house
at
night
and
knocks
there
is
a
peculiar
muffled
sound
about
the
knocking
by
which
you
can
tell
that
the
visitor
is
a
fox
if
you
have
experienced
ears
for
a
fox
knocks
at
doors
with
its
tail
if
you
open
then
you
will
see
a
man
or
perhaps
a
beautiful
girl
who
will
talk
to
you
only
in
fragments
of
words
but
nevertheless
in
such
a
way
that
you
can
perfectly
well
understand
a
fox
can
not
pronounce
a
whole
word
but
a
part
only
as
sa
for
for
or
de
for
desuka
then
if
you
are
a
friend
of
foxes
the
visitor
will
present
you
with
a
little
gift
of
some
sort
and
at
once
vanish
away
into
the
darkness
whatever
the
gift
may
be
it
will
seem
much
larger
that
night
than
in
the
morning
only
a
part
of
a
is
real
a
matsue
shizoku
going
home
one
night
by
way
of
the
street
called
horomachi
saw
a
fox
running
for
its
life
pursued
by
dogs
he
beat
the
dogs
off
with
his
umbrella
thus
giving
the
fox
a
chance
to
escape
on
the
following
evening
he
heard
some
one
knock
at
his
door
and
on
opening
the
to
saw
a
very
pretty
girl
standing
there
who
said
to
him
night
i
should
have
died
but
for
your
august
kindness
i
know
not
how
to
thank
you
enough
this
is
only
a
pitiable
little
present
and
she
laid
a
small
bundle
at
his
feet
and
went
away
he
opened
the
bundle
and
found
two
beautiful
ducks
and
two
pieces
of
silver
money
those
long
heavy
pieces
of
money
each
worth
ten
or
twelve
dollars
such
as
are
now
eagerly
sought
for
by
collectors
of
antique
things
after
a
little
while
one
of
the
coins
changed
before
his
eyes
into
a
piece
of
grass
the
other
was
always
good
a
physician
of
matsue
was
called
one
evening
to
attend
a
case
of
confinement
at
a
house
some
distance
from
the
city
on
the
hill
called
shiragayama
he
was
guided
by
a
servant
carrying
a
paper
lantern
painted
with
an
aristocratic
crest
he
entered
into
a
magnificent
house
where
he
was
received
with
superb
samurai
courtesy
the
mother
was
safely
delivered
of
a
fine
boy
the
family
treated
the
physician
to
an
excellent
dinner
entertained
him
elegantly
and
sent
him
home
loaded
with
presents
and
money
next
day
he
went
according
to
japanese
etiquette
to
return
thanks
to
his
hosts
he
could
not
find
the
house
there
was
in
fact
nothing
on
shiragayama
except
forest
returning
home
he
examined
again
the
gold
which
had
been
paid
to
him
all
was
good
except
one
piece
which
had
changed
into
grass
sec
curious
advantages
have
been
taken
of
the
superstitions
relating
to
the
in
matsue
several
years
ago
there
was
a
tofuya
which
enjoyed
an
unusually
large
patronage
a
tofuya
is
a
shop
where
tofu
is
sold
a
curd
prepared
from
beans
and
much
resembling
good
custard
in
appearance
of
all
eatable
things
foxes
are
most
fond
of
tofu
and
of
soba
which
is
a
preparation
of
buckwheat
there
is
even
a
legend
that
a
fox
in
the
semblance
of
an
elegantly
attired
man
once
visited
a
popular
sobaya
on
the
lake
shore
and
ate
much
soba
but
after
the
guest
was
gone
the
money
he
had
paid
changed
into
wooden
shavings
the
proprietor
of
the
tofuya
had
a
different
experience
a
man
in
wretched
attire
used
to
come
to
his
shop
every
evening
to
buy
a
cho
of
tofu
which
he
devoured
on
the
spot
with
the
haste
of
one
long
famished
every
evening
for
weeks
he
came
and
never
spoke
but
the
landlord
saw
one
evening
the
tip
of
a
bushy
white
tail
protruding
from
beneath
the
stranger
rags
the
sight
aroused
strange
surmises
and
weird
hopes
from
that
night
he
began
to
treat
the
mysterious
visitor
with
obsequious
kindness
but
another
month
passed
before
the
latter
spoke
then
what
he
said
was
about
as
follows
i
seem
to
you
a
man
i
am
not
a
man
and
i
took
upon
myself
human
form
only
for
the
purpose
of
visiting
you
i
come
from
where
my
temple
is
at
which
you
often
visit
and
being
desirous
to
reward
your
piety
and
goodness
of
heart
i
have
come
to
save
you
from
a
great
danger
for
by
the
power
which
i
possess
i
know
that
tomorrow
this
street
will
burn
and
all
the
houses
in
it
shall
be
utterly
destroyed
except
yours
to
save
it
i
am
going
to
make
a
charm
but
in
order
that
i
may
do
this
you
must
open
your
kura
that
i
may
enter
and
allow
no
one
to
watch
me
for
should
living
eye
look
upon
me
there
the
charm
will
not
avail
the
shopkeeper
with
fervent
words
of
gratitude
opened
his
storehouse
and
reverently
admitted
the
seeming
inari
and
gave
orders
that
none
of
his
household
or
servants
should
keep
watch
and
these
orders
were
so
well
obeyed
that
all
the
stores
within
the
storehouse
and
all
the
valuables
of
the
family
were
removed
without
hindrance
during
the
night
next
day
the
kura
was
found
to
be
empty
and
there
was
no
fire
there
is
also
a
story
about
another
wealthy
shopkeeper
of
matsue
who
easily
became
the
prey
of
another
pretended
inari
this
inari
told
him
that
whatever
sum
of
money
he
should
leave
at
a
certain
miya
by
night
he
would
find
it
doubled
in
the
morning
as
the
reward
of
his
lifelong
piety
the
shopkeeper
carried
several
small
sums
to
the
miya
and
found
them
doubled
within
twelve
hours
then
he
deposited
larger
sums
which
were
similarly
multiplied
he
even
risked
some
hundreds
of
dollars
which
were
duplicated
finally
he
took
all
his
money
out
of
the
bank
and
placed
it
one
evening
within
the
shrine
of
the
god
and
never
saw
it
again
sec
vast
is
the
literature
of
the
subject
of
foxes
ghostly
foxes
some
of
it
is
old
as
the
eleventh
century
in
the
ancient
romances
and
the
modern
cheap
novel
in
historical
traditions
and
in
popular
foxes
perform
wonderful
parts
there
are
very
beautiful
and
very
sad
and
very
terrible
stories
about
foxes
there
are
legends
of
foxes
discussed
by
great
scholars
and
legends
of
foxes
known
to
every
child
in
japan
such
as
the
history
of
tamamonomae
the
beautiful
favourite
of
the
emperor
toba
tamamonomae
whose
name
has
passed
into
a
proverb
and
who
proved
at
last
to
be
only
a
demon
fox
with
nine
tails
and
fur
of
gold
but
the
most
interesting
part
of
belongs
to
the
japanese
stage
where
the
popular
beliefs
are
often
most
humorously
reflected
as
in
the
following
excerpts
from
the
comedy
of
written
by
one
jippensha
ikku
kidahachi
and
iyaji
are
travelling
from
yedo
to
osaka
when
within
a
short
distance
of
akasaka
kidahachi
hastens
on
in
advance
to
secure
good
accommodations
at
the
best
inn
iyaji
travelling
along
leisurely
stops
a
little
while
at
a
small
wayside
kept
by
an
old
woman
old
please
take
some
tea
sir
thank
you
how
far
is
it
from
here
to
the
next
town
akasaka
old
about
one
ri
but
if
you
have
no
companion
you
had
better
remain
here
because
there
is
a
bad
fox
on
the
way
who
bewitches
travellers
i
am
afraid
of
that
sort
of
thing
but
i
must
go
on
for
my
companion
has
gone
on
ahead
of
me
and
will
be
waiting
for
me
after
having
paid
for
his
refreshments
iyaji
proceeds
on
his
way
the
night
is
very
dark
and
he
feels
quite
nervous
on
account
of
what
the
old
woman
has
told
him
after
having
walked
a
considerable
distance
he
suddenly
hears
a
fox
yelping
feeling
still
more
afraid
he
shouts
at
the
top
of
his
voice
come
near
me
and
i
will
kill
you
meanwhile
kidahachi
who
has
also
been
frightened
by
the
old
stories
and
has
therefore
determined
to
wait
for
iyaji
is
saying
to
himself
in
the
dark
i
do
not
wait
for
him
we
shall
certainly
be
deluded
suddenly
he
hears
iyaji
voice
and
cries
out
to
him
o
what
are
you
doing
there
i
did
intend
to
go
on
ahead
but
i
became
afraid
and
so
i
concluded
to
stop
here
and
wait
for
you
iyaji
who
imagines
that
the
fox
has
taken
the
shape
of
kidahachi
to
deceive
him
do
not
think
that
you
are
going
to
dupe
me
that
is
a
queer
way
to
talk
i
have
some
nice
mochi
here
which
i
bought
for
you
can
not
be
eaten
do
be
suspicious
i
am
really
kidahachi
iyaji
springing
upon
him
furiously
yes
you
took
the
form
of
kidahachi
just
to
deceive
me
what
do
you
mean
what
are
you
going
to
do
to
me
i
am
going
to
kill
you
throws
him
down
oh
you
have
hurt
me
very
much
please
leave
me
alone
if
you
are
really
hurt
then
let
me
see
you
in
your
real
shape
they
struggle
together
what
are
you
doing
putting
your
hand
there
i
am
feeling
for
your
tail
if
you
do
put
out
your
tail
at
once
i
shall
make
you
takes
his
towel
and
with
it
ties
kidahachi
hands
behind
his
back
and
then
drives
him
before
him
please
untie
me
please
untie
me
first
by
this
time
they
have
almost
reached
akasaka
and
iyaji
seeing
a
dog
calls
the
animal
and
drags
kidahachi
close
to
it
for
a
dog
is
believed
to
be
able
to
detect
a
fox
through
any
disguise
but
the
dog
takes
no
notice
of
kidahachi
iyaji
therefore
unties
him
and
apologises
and
they
both
laugh
at
their
previous
fears
sec
but
there
are
some
very
pleasing
forms
of
the
for
example
there
stands
in
a
very
obscure
street
of
matsue
one
of
those
streets
no
stranger
is
likely
to
enter
unless
he
loses
his
way
a
temple
called
and
also
or
children
inari
it
is
very
small
but
very
famous
and
it
has
been
recently
presented
with
a
pair
of
new
stone
foxes
very
large
which
have
gilded
teeth
and
a
peculiarly
playful
expression
of
countenance
these
sit
one
on
each
side
of
the
gate
the
male
grinning
with
open
jaws
the
female
demure
with
mouth
closed
in
the
court
you
will
find
many
ancient
little
foxes
with
noses
heads
or
tails
broken
two
great
karashishi
before
which
straw
sandals
waraji
have
been
suspended
as
votive
offerings
by
somebody
with
sore
feet
who
has
prayed
to
the
that
they
will
heal
his
affliction
and
a
shrine
of
kojin
occupied
by
the
corpses
of
many
children
dolls
the
grated
doors
of
the
shrine
of
like
those
of
the
shrine
of
yaegaki
are
white
with
the
multitude
of
little
papers
tied
to
them
which
papers
signify
prayers
but
the
prayers
are
special
and
curious
to
right
and
to
left
of
the
doors
and
also
above
them
odd
little
votive
pictures
are
pasted
upon
the
walls
mostly
representing
children
in
or
children
getting
their
heads
shaved
there
are
also
one
or
two
representing
children
at
play
now
the
interpretation
of
these
signs
and
wonders
is
as
follows
doubtless
you
know
that
japanese
children
as
well
as
japanese
adults
must
take
a
hot
bath
every
day
also
that
it
is
the
custom
to
shave
the
heads
of
very
small
boys
and
girls
but
in
spite
of
hereditary
patience
and
strong
ancestral
tendency
to
follow
ancient
custom
young
children
find
both
the
razor
and
the
hot
bath
difficult
to
endure
with
their
delicate
skins
for
the
japanese
hot
bath
is
very
hot
not
less
than
degs
as
a
general
rule
and
even
the
adult
foreigner
must
learn
slowly
to
bear
it
and
to
appreciate
its
hygienic
value
also
the
japanese
razor
is
a
much
less
perfect
instrument
than
ours
and
is
used
without
any
lather
and
is
apt
to
hurt
a
little
unless
used
by
the
most
skilful
hands
and
finally
japanese
parents
are
not
tyrannical
with
their
children
they
pet
and
coax
very
rarely
compel
or
terrify
so
that
it
is
quite
a
dilemma
for
them
when
the
baby
revolts
against
the
bath
or
mutinies
against
the
razor
the
parents
of
the
child
who
refuses
to
be
shaved
or
bathed
have
recourse
to
the
god
is
besought
to
send
one
of
his
retainers
to
amuse
the
child
and
reconcile
it
to
the
new
order
of
things
and
render
it
both
docile
and
happy
also
if
a
child
is
naughty
or
falls
sick
this
inari
is
appealed
to
if
the
prayer
be
granted
some
small
present
is
made
to
the
temple
sometimes
a
votive
picture
such
as
those
pasted
by
the
door
representing
the
successful
result
of
the
petition
to
judge
by
the
number
of
such
pictures
and
by
the
prosperity
of
the
temple
the
would
seem
to
deserve
his
popularity
even
during
the
few
minutes
i
passed
in
his
court
i
saw
three
young
mothers
with
infants
at
their
backs
come
to
the
shrine
and
pray
and
make
offerings
i
noticed
that
one
of
the
children
remarkably
pretty
had
never
been
shaved
at
all
this
was
evidently
a
very
obstinate
case
while
returning
from
my
visit
to
the
jigyoba
inani
my
japanese
servant
who
had
guided
me
there
told
me
this
story
the
son
of
his
neighbour
a
boy
of
seven
went
out
to
play
one
morning
and
disappeared
for
two
days
the
parents
were
not
at
first
uneasy
supposing
that
the
child
had
gone
to
the
house
of
a
relative
where
he
was
accustomed
to
pass
a
day
or
two
from
time
to
time
but
on
the
evening
of
the
second
day
it
was
learned
that
the
child
had
not
been
at
the
house
in
question
search
was
at
once
made
but
neither
search
nor
inquiry
availed
late
at
night
however
a
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
of
the
boy
dwelling
and
the
mother
hurrying
out
found
her
truant
fast
asleep
on
the
ground
she
could
not
discover
who
had
knocked
the
boy
upon
being
awakened
laughed
and
said
that
on
the
morning
of
his
disappearance
he
had
met
a
lad
of
about
his
own
age
with
very
pretty
eyes
who
had
coaxed
him
away
to
the
woods
where
they
had
played
together
all
day
and
night
and
the
next
day
at
very
curious
funny
games
but
at
last
he
got
sleepy
and
his
comrade
took
him
home
he
was
not
hungry
the
comrade
promised
come
but
the
mysterious
comrade
never
came
and
no
boy
of
the
description
given
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
the
inference
was
that
the
comrade
was
a
fox
who
wanted
to
have
a
little
fun
the
subject
of
the
fun
mourned
long
in
vain
for
his
merry
companion
sec
some
thirty
years
ago
there
lived
in
matsue
an
named
tobikawa
who
was
a
relentless
enemy
of
foxes
and
used
to
hunt
and
kill
them
he
was
popularly
believed
to
enjoy
immunity
from
bewitchment
because
of
his
immense
strength
but
there
were
some
old
folks
who
predicted
that
he
would
not
die
a
natural
death
this
prediction
was
fulfilled
tobikawa
died
in
a
very
curious
manner
he
was
excessively
fond
of
practical
jokes
one
day
he
disguised
himself
as
a
tengu
or
sacred
goblin
with
wings
and
claws
and
long
nose
and
ascended
a
lofty
tree
in
a
sacred
grove
near
rakusan
whither
after
a
little
while
the
innocent
peasants
thronged
to
worship
him
with
offerings
while
diverting
himself
with
this
spectacle
and
trying
to
play
his
part
by
springing
nimbly
from
one
branch
to
another
he
missed
his
footing
and
broke
his
neck
in
the
fall
sec
but
these
strange
beliefs
are
swiftly
passing
away
year
by
year
more
shrines
of
inari
crumble
down
never
to
be
rebuilt
year
by
year
the
statuaries
make
fewer
images
of
foxes
year
by
year
fewer
victims
of
are
taken
to
the
hospitals
to
be
treated
according
to
the
best
scientific
methods
by
japanese
physicians
who
speak
german
the
cause
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
decadence
of
the
old
faiths
a
superstition
outlives
a
religion
much
less
is
it
to
be
sought
for
in
the
efforts
of
proselytising
missionaries
from
the

signifies
dry

modern
japanese
faith
places
that
river
in

whatever
be
the
true
history
of
the
myth
it
is
certainly
japanese
and
the
conception
of
jizo
as
the
lover

playfellow
of

children

japan

pray
there
are

may

for
he
is
also
the
patron
of
pilgrims

those
who
have
never
married

the
indian
conception
has
been
totally

as
the

might
be

to
infer
that
the
appellation
is
almost
equivalent
to
our
phrase
name

legion
and
a
japanese
friend
assures
me
that
the
inference
would
not
be
far
wrong
anciently
the
peasants
had
no
family
name
each
was
known
by
his
personal
appellation
coupled
with
the
name
of
his
lord
as
possessor
or
ruler
thus
a
hundred
peasants
on
one
estate
would
all
be
known
by
the
name
of
their
master
this
custom
of
praying
for
the
souls
of
animals
is
by
no
means
general
but
i
have
seen
in
the
western
provinces
several
burials
of
domestic
animals
at
which
such
prayers
were
said
after
the
earth
was
filled
in
some
were
lighted
above
the
grave
in
each
instance
and
the
prayers
were
repeated
in

whisper
a
friend
in
the
capital
sends
me
the
following
curious
information
the
temple

prayers
are
offered
up
every

for
the
souls
of
certain

whose

procure

similar

exist

no
one
capable

affection
for

can
mock
these
gentle
customs
why
six
jizo
instead
of
five
or
three
or
any
other
number
the
reader
may
ask
i
myself
asked
the
question
many
times
before
receiving
any
satisfactory
reply
perhaps
the
following
legend
affords
the
most
satisfactory
explanation
according
to
the
book
was
a
woman
ten
thousand
ko
kalpas
before
this
era
and
became
filled
with
desire
to
convert
all
living
beings
of
the
six
worlds
and
the
four
births
and
by
virtue
of
the
supernatural
powers
she
multiplied
herself
and
simultaneously
appeared
in
all
the
rokussho
or
six
states
of
sentient
existence
at
once
namely
in
the
jigoku
gaki
chikusho
shura
ningen
tenjo
and
converted
the
dwellers
thereof
a
friend
insists
that
in
order
to
have
done
this
jizo
must
first
have
become
a
man
among
the
many
names
of
jizo
such
as
never
slumbering
shining
king
i
find
the
significant
appellation
of
countless
bodied
since
this
sketch
was
written
i
have
seen
the
in
many
different
parts
of
japan
but
i
have
never
witnessed
exactly
the
same
kind
of
dance
indeed
i
would
judge
from
my
experiences
in
izumo
in
oki
in
tottori
in
hoki
in
bingo
and
elsewhere
that
the
bonodori
is
not
danced
in
the
same
way
in
any
two
provinces
not
only
do
the
motions
and
gestures
vary
according
to
locality
but
also
the
airs
of
the
songs
sung
and
this
even
when
the
words
are
the
same
in
some
places
the
measure
is
slow
and
solemn
in
others
it
is
rapid
and
merry
and
characterised
by
a
queer
jerky
swing
impossible
to
describe
but
everywhere
both
the
motion
and
the
melody
are
curious
and
pleasing
enough
to
fascinate
the
spectator
for
hours
certainly
these
primitive
dances
are
of
far
greater
interest
than
the
performances
of
geisha
although
buddhism
may
have
utilised
them
and
influenced
them
they
are
beyond
doubt
incomparably
older
than
buddhism

in
the

of
the

even
now
each

some
change
occurs
i
have
seen
several
very
strange
ones
the
hakuja

is
also
the

of

goddess
of

of
beauty
of
eloquence

of

the
face
of
an
ancient
man
with
white
eyebrows
and
wears
upon
its
head
a
crown
both
goddess
and
serpent
can
be
identified
with
ancient
indian
mythological
beings
and
buddhism
first
introduced
both
into
japan
among
the
people
especially
perhaps
in
izumo
certain
divinities
of
buddhism
are
often
identified
or
rather
confused
with
certain
kami
in
popular
worship
and
parlance
since
this
sketch
was
written
i
have
had
opportunity
of
seeing
a
within
a
few
hours
after
its
capture
it
was
between
two
and
three
feet
long
and
about
one
inch
in
diameter
at
its
thickest
girth
the
upper
part
of
the
body
was
a
very
dark
brown
and
the
belly
yellowish
white
toward
the
tail
there
were
some
beautiful
yellowish
mottlings
the
body
was
not
cylindrical
but
curiously
like
those
elaborately
woven
which
have
four
edges
the
tail
was
flat
and
triangular
like
that
of
certain
fish
a
japanese
teacher
watanabe
of
the
normal
school
of
matsue
identified
the
little
creature
as
a
hydrophid
of
the
species
called
pelamis
bicalor
it
is
so
seldom
seen
however
that
i
think
the

superficial
description
of
it
may
not
be
without
interest

some

in

the
little
serpent
may
be
seen
i
saw
one
that
had
become
brittle
and
black
with
age
but
was
excellently
preserved
by
some
process
of
which
i
did
not
learn

nature
it
had
been
admirably
posed
in
a
tiny
wire
cage
made
to
fit
exactly
into

of
white
wood
and
must
have
been
when
alive

most
ancient
divinities
of

in

confounded
with

of

is
similarly
confounded

patron
of

origin
of

in

of
the
former
but
the

of

kitajima
family
has
usually
been
appointed
a
kitajima
holds
the
lesser
office
the
term
kokuzo
is
not
correctly
speaking
a
spiritual
but
rather
a
temporal
title
the
kokuzo
has
always
been
the
emperor
deputy
to
kitzuki
the
person
appointed
to
worship
the
deity
in
the
emperor
stead
but
the
real
spiritual
title
of
such
a
deputy
is
that
still
borne

the

is

more
complicated
in
construction
and
certainly
represents
a
much
more
advanced
stage
of
mechanical
knowledge
than
the
kitzuki
indicates
during
a
subsequent
visit
to
kitzuki
i
learned
that
the

used
only
as
a
sort
of
primitive
instrument
it
gives
the
right
tone
for
the
true
chant
which
i
did
not
hear
during

the

the
commentator

more
briefly
or

this
is
according
to

a
mere
fanciful
etymology
but
it
is
accepted
by
shinto
faith
and
for
that
reason
only
is
here
given
the
title
of
kokuzo
indeed
still
exists
but
it
is
now
merely
honorary
having
no
official

many
