the
son
of
gilbert
it
was
a
winter
night
and
the
ground
around
paris
was
covered
with
snow
although
the
flakes
had
ceased
to
fall
since
some
hours
spite
of
the
cold
and
the
darkness
a
young
man
wrapped
in
a
mantle
so
voluminous
as
to
hide
a
babe
in
his
arms
strode
over
the
white
fields
out
of
the
town
of
villers
cotterets
in
the
woods
eighteen
leagues
from
the
capital
which
he
had
reached
by
the
towards
a
hamlet
called
haramont
his
assured
step
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
had
previously
gone
this
road
soon
above
him
streaked
the
leafless
boughs
upon
the
grey
sky
the
sharp
air
the
odor
of
the
oaks
the
icicles
and
beads
on
the
tips
of
branches
all
appealed
to
the
poetry
in
the
wanderer
through
the
clumps
he
looked
for
the
village
spire
and
the
blue
smoke
of
the
chimneys
filtering
from
the
cottages
through
the
natural
trellis
of
the
limbs
it
was
dawn
when
he
crossed
a
brook
bordered
with
yellow
cress
and
frozen
vines
and
at
the
first
hovel
asked
for
the
laborer
boy
to
take
him
to
madeline
pitou
home
mute
and
attentive
not
so
dull
as
most
of
their
kind
the
children
sprang
up
and
staring
at
the
stranger
led
him
by
the
hand
to
a
rather
large
and
cottage
on
the
bank
of
the
rivulet
running
by
most
of
the
dwellings
a
plank
served
as
a
bridge
there
said
one
of
the
guides
nodding
his
head
towards
it
gilbert
gave
them
a
coin
which
made
their
eyes
open
still
more
widely
and
crossed
the
board
to
the
door
which
he
pushed
open
while
the
children
taking
one
another
hand
started
with
all
their
might
at
the
handsome
gentleman
in
a
brown
cloth
coat
buckled
shoes
and
large
cloak
who
wanted
to
find
madeline
pitou
apart
from
them
gilbert
for
such
was
the
young
man
name
simply
so
for
he
had
no
other
saw
no
living
things
haramont
was
the
deserted
village
he
was
seeking
as
soon
as
the
door
was
open
his
sight
was
struck
by
a
scene
full
of
charm
for
almost
anybody
and
particularly
for
a
young
philosopher
like
our
roamer
a
robust
peasant
woman
was
suckling
a
baby
while
another
child
a
sturdy
boy
of
four
or
five
was
saying
a
prayer
in
a
loud
voice
in
the
chimney
corner
near
a
window
or
rather
a
hole
in
the
wall
in
which
was
stuck
a
pane
of
glass
another
woman
going
on
for
or
six
was
spinning
with
a
stool
under
her
feet
and
a
fat
poodle
on
an
end
of
this
stool
catching
sight
of
the
visitor
the
dog
barked
in
a
civil
and
hospitable
manner
just
to
show
that
he
had
not
been
caught
napping
the
praying
boy
turned
cutting
the
devotional
phrase
in
two
and
both
females
uttered
an
exclamation
between
joy
and
surprise
i
greet
you
good
mother
madeline
said
gilbert
with
a
smile
the
gentleman
has
my
name
she
cried
out
with
a
start
as
you
notice
but
please
do
not
interrupt
me
instead
of
one
babe
at
the
breast
you
are
to
have
the
pair
in
the
rude
crib
he
laid
his
burden
a
little
boy
what
a
pretty
darling
ejaculated
the
spinner
quite
a
dear
yes
aunt
angelique
said
madeline
your
sister
inquired
the
visitor
pointing
to
the
spinner
who
was
also
a
spinster
no
my
man
sister
yes
my
auntie
my
aunt
mumbled
the
boy
striking
into
the
talk
without
being
asked
be
quiet
ange
rebuked
his
mother
you
are
interrupting
the
gentleman
my
business
is
very
plain
good
woman
the
child
you
see
is
son
of
one
of
my
master
farmers
the
farmer
being
ruined
my
master
his
godfather
wants
him
brought
up
in
the
country
to
become
a
good
workman
hale
and
with
good
manners
will
you
undertake
this
rearing
but
master
born
yesterday
and
never
nursed
went
on
gilbert
besides
this
is
the
nursling
which
master
niquet
the
lawyer
at
villers
cotterets
spoke
to
you
about
madeline
instantly
seized
the
babe
and
supplied
it
with
the
nourishment
it
craved
with
a
generous
impetuosity
deeply
affecting
the
young
man
i
have
not
been
misled
said
he
you
are
a
good
woman
in
my
master
name
i
confide
the
child
to
you
i
see
that
he
will
fare
well
here
and
i
trust
he
will
bring
into
this
cabin
a
dream
of
happiness
together
with
his
own
how
much
does
master
niquet
pay
you
for
his
children
twelve
livres
sir
but
he
is
rich
and
he
adds
a
few
pieces
for
sugar
and
toys
mother
madeline
replied
gilbert
proudly
this
child
will
bring
you
twenty
livres
or
two
hundred
and
forty
lord
bless
us
i
thank
you
kindly
master
said
the
peasant
and
here
is
the
first
year
money
down
on
the
nail
went
on
gilbert
placing
ten
fine
gold
coins
on
the
table
which
made
the
two
women
open
their
eyes
and
little
ange
pitou
stretch
out
his
devastating
hand
but
if
the
little
thing
should
not
live
queried
the
nurse
timidly
it
would
be
a
great
blow
such
a
misfortune
as
seldom
happens
responded
the
gentleman
here
is
the
hire
settled
are
you
satisfied
oh
yes
sir
let
us
now
pass
to
the
future
payments
then
we
are
to
keep
the
child
probably
and
be
parents
to
it
said
gilbert
in
a
stifled
voice
and
losing
color
dear
dear
is
he
an
outcast
gilbert
had
not
expected
such
feeling
and
questions
but
he
recovered
from
the
emotion
i
did
not
tell
you
the
whole
truth
he
said
the
poor
father
died
on
the
shock
of
hearing
that
his
wife
gave
up
her
life
in
bearing
him
the
child
the
women
wrung
their
hands
with
sympathy
so
that
the
child
can
reckon
on
no
love
from
his
parents
continued
gilbert
breathing
painfully
at
this
point
in
tramped
daddy
pitou
with
a
calm
and
jolly
manner
his
was
one
of
those
round
and
honest
characters
overflowing
with
health
and
good
will
such
as
greuze
paints
in
his
natural
domestic
pictures
a
few
words
showed
him
how
matters
stood
out
of
good
nature
he
understood
things
even
those
beyond
his
comprehension
gilbert
made
it
clear
that
the
would
be
paid
until
the
boy
was
a
man
and
able
to
live
alone
with
his
mind
and
arm
all
right
said
pitou
i
rather
think
we
shall
take
to
the
kid
though
he
is
a
tiny
creature
look
at
that
said
the
women
together
he
thinks
it
a
little
dear
just
like
us
i
should
like
you
to
come
over
to
master
niquet
where
i
will
leave
the
money
required
so
that
you
may
be
content
and
the
child
happy
gilbert
took
leave
of
the
women
and
bent
over
the
cradle
in
which
the
had
ousted
the
rightful
heir
he
wore
a
sombre
air
you
look
little
like
me
he
muttered
for
you
have
the
aspect
of
your
proud
mother
the
aristocratic
andrea
daughter
of
baron
taverney
the
trait
broke
his
heart
he
pressed
his
nails
into
his
flesh
to
keep
down
the
tears
flowing
from
his
aching
breast
he
left
a
kiss
timid
and
tremulous
on
the
babe
fresh
cheek
and
tottered
out
he
gave
half
a
louis
to
little
ange
who
was
stumbling
between
his
legs
and
shook
hands
with
the
women
who
thought
it
an
honor
so
many
emotions
oppressed
the
father
of
eighteen
years
that
little
more
would
have
prostrated
him
pale
and
nervous
his
brain
was
spinning
let
us
be
off
he
said
to
pitou
waiting
on
the
sill
master
called
out
madeline
from
the
threshold
his
name
what
did
you
say
his
name
is
call
him
gilbert
replied
the
young
man
with
manly
pride
the
business
at
the
notary
was
quickly
done
money
was
banked
for
the
child
keep
and
bringing
up
as
became
a
farmhand
offspring
for
fifteen
years
education
and
training
was
to
be
given
him
and
the
balance
was
to
be
devoted
to
fitting
him
in
a
trade
or
buying
a
plot
of
land
at
his
eighteenth
year
some
two
thousand
livres
were
to
be
paid
the
nurse
and
her
husband
who
would
have
the
other
sum
yearly
from
the
intermediary
as
a
reward
niquet
was
to
have
the
interest
of
the
funds
ten
years
passed
and
the
pitou
woman
who
had
lost
her
husband
while
ange
was
hardly
able
to
remember
him
felt
herself
dying
three
years
before
she
had
seen
gilbert
returned
a
man
of
stiff
dogmatic
of
speech
cold
at
the
outset
but
his
mask
of
ice
thawed
when
he
saw
his
son
again
hearty
smiling
and
strong
brought
up
as
he
had
planned
he
shook
the
good
widow
hand
and
said
rely
on
me
if
ever
in
need
he
took
the
child
away
went
to
see
the
tomb
of
rousseau
the
philosopher
musician
and
poet
and
returned
to
villers
cotterets
seduced
by
the
good
air
and
the
praise
of
the
abbe
fortier
school
for
youth
he
left
gilbert
at
that
institution
he
had
thought
highly
of
the
tutor
philosophical
mien
for
philosophy
was
a
great
power
at
this
revolutionary
period
and
had
glided
into
the
bosom
of
the
church
he
left
him
his
address
and
departed
for
paris
ange
pitou
mother
knew
these
particulars
at
her
dying
hour
she
remembered
the
pledge
of
gilbert
to
be
the
friend
at
need
it
was
a
bright
light
no
doubt
providence
had
brought
him
to
haramont
to
provide
poor
pitou
with
more
than
he
lost
in
losing
life
and
family
not
able
to
write
she
sent
for
the
parish
priest
who
wrote
a
letter
for
her
and
this
was
given
to
abbe
fortier
to
be
sent
off
by
the
post
it
was
time
for
she
died
next
day
chapter
ii
ange
pitou
ange
was
too
young
to
feel
the
whole
extent
of
his
loss
but
he
divined
that
the
angel
of
the
hearth
had
vanished
and
when
the
body
was
taken
to
the
churchyard
and
interred
he
sat
down
by
the
grave
and
replied
to
all
pleadings
for
him
to
come
away
by
saying
that
mamma
madeline
was
there
that
he
never
had
left
her
and
he
would
stay
beside
her
now
it
was
there
that
gilbert
for
ange
pitou
future
guardian
was
a
physician
found
him
when
he
hastened
to
haramont
on
receiving
the
dying
mother
appeal
ange
was
very
young
when
thus
he
saw
the
doctor
for
the
first
time
but
we
know
youth
can
feel
deep
impressions
leaving
everlasting
memories
the
previous
passing
of
the
young
man
of
mystery
through
the
cottage
had
impressed
its
trace
he
had
left
welfare
with
the
boy
every
time
ange
heard
his
mother
pronounce
the
benefactor
name
it
had
been
almost
with
worship
finally
when
he
appeared
grown
up
adorned
with
the
title
of
physician
joining
to
the
past
boons
the
future
promises
pitou
had
judged
by
his
mother
gratitude
that
he
ought
himself
be
grateful
the
poor
lad
without
clearly
knowing
what
he
was
saying
faltered
words
of
eternal
remembrance
and
profound
thanks
such
as
he
had
heard
his
mother
use
therefore
as
soon
as
he
perceived
the
doctor
coming
among
the
grassy
graves
and
broken
crosses
he
understood
that
he
came
at
his
appeal
and
he
could
not
say
no
to
him
as
to
the
others
he
made
him
no
resistance
except
to
turn
his
head
to
look
backwards
as
gilbert
grasped
his
hand
and
led
him
from
the
cemetery
a
stylish
cab
was
at
the
gates
into
which
the
doctor
made
the
poor
boy
step
and
he
was
taken
to
the
town
tailor
where
he
was
fitted
with
clothes
they
were
made
too
large
so
that
he
would
grow
up
to
them
at
the
rate
our
hero
grew
this
would
not
take
long
thus
equipped
ange
was
walked
in
a
quarter
of
the
town
called
pleux
where
pitou
pace
slacked
he
recalled
this
as
being
the
abode
of
his
aunt
angelique
of
whom
he
had
preserved
an
appalling
memory
indeed
the
old
maid
had
no
attractions
for
a
boy
who
cherished
true
motherly
affections
she
was
nearly
sixty
by
this
period
the
minute
practice
of
religion
had
brutalized
her
and
mistaken
piety
had
twisted
all
sweet
merciful
and
humane
feelings
so
that
she
cultivated
in
their
stead
a
natural
dose
of
greedy
intelligence
augmented
daily
by
her
association
with
all
the
prudes
she
did
not
precisely
live
on
public
charity
but
besides
the
sale
of
linen
thread
and
letting
out
chairs
in
the
church
she
received
from
kindly
souls
ensnared
by
her
devout
posturings
petty
coin
which
she
converted
into
silver
and
that
into
gold
nobody
suspected
she
accumulated
them
and
she
stuffed
the
gold
in
the
cushion
and
frame
of
an
old
armchair
in
which
she
sat
at
work
it
was
to
this
venerable
relative
dwelling
that
gilbert
led
little
pitou
we
might
say
big
pitou
for
he
was
too
large
for
his
age
miss
rose
angelique
pitou
as
they
came
up
was
in
a
merry
humor
as
she
had
just
sent
another
gold
piece
to
go
and
keep
company
with
the
rest
of
her
hoard
she
was
going
around
her
seat
of
revenue
when
the
doctor
and
his
ward
appeared
at
the
door
and
she
had
to
welcome
the
relic
of
her
family
the
interview
would
have
been
affecting
if
it
had
not
been
so
grotesque
the
doctor
a
man
of
keen
observation
and
physiognomist
read
the
character
of
the
hypocritical
old
maid
at
a
glance
with
her
long
nose
thin
lips
and
small
bright
eyes
she
collected
in
one
person
cupidity
selfishness
and
hypocrisy
as
soon
as
the
stranger
stated
his
little
text
on
the
duty
of
aunts
to
take
care
of
their
nieces
and
nephews
she
turned
sour
and
replied
that
whatever
her
love
for
her
poor
sister
and
her
interest
in
her
dear
little
nephew
the
slenderness
of
her
means
did
not
permit
her
though
she
was
godmother
as
well
as
aunt
to
add
to
her
expenses
it
is
this
way
master
gilbert
this
would
run
me
into
six
cents
a
day
extra
for
that
lubberly
boy
would
eat
a
pound
of
bread
ange
screwed
up
his
face
for
he
could
tuck
away
a
pound
and
a
half
at
breakfast
alone
this
is
saying
nothing
for
his
washing
for
he
is
a
dirty
little
chap
considering
that
ange
was
a
regular
gipsy
for
burrowing
after
moles
and
climbing
trees
this
was
true
enough
but
it
is
fair
to
say
that
he
tore
his
clothes
worse
than
he
soiled
them
fie
said
doctor
gilbert
do
you
who
understand
the
christian
virtues
so
well
make
such
close
calculations
about
a
nephew
and
an
orphan
then
the
keeping
of
his
clothes
in
repair
went
on
the
miser
recalling
the
quantity
of
patches
she
had
seen
sewn
by
her
sister
on
the
knees
and
seat
of
master
ange
pants
in
short
said
the
doctor
you
refuse
to
shelter
your
nephew
in
your
house
the
orphan
boy
who
will
have
to
beg
for
alms
at
the
doors
of
others
mean
as
she
was
she
felt
the
disgrace
befalling
her
as
if
she
drove
her
next
of
kin
to
this
step
no
i
will
take
charge
of
him
she
said
good
said
the
doctor
delighted
to
find
a
moist
spot
in
this
desert
i
will
recommend
him
to
the
augustin
monastery
and
have
them
take
him
as
a
boy
of
all
work
the
doctor
was
a
philosopher
we
have
mentioned
which
means
that
he
was
the
opponent
of
all
the
churchmen
he
resolved
to
tear
this
recruit
from
the
enemy
with
all
the
warmth
that
the
augustines
would
have
shown
to
deprive
him
of
a
disciple
well
he
rejoined
sticking
his
hand
in
his
deepest
pocket
since
you
are
in
so
hard
a
position
dear
miss
angelique
that
you
are
forced
to
send
your
nephew
into
beggary
i
will
find
somebody
else
to
take
him
and
the
sum
i
am
going
to
set
aside
for
his
maintenance
i
am
obliged
to
return
to
america
meanwhile
i
must
apprentice
the
boy
to
some
craft
which
he
can
choose
for
himself
in
my
absence
he
will
grow
up
and
then
we
will
see
what
to
make
of
him
kiss
your
good
aunt
and
let
us
try
our
luck
elsewhere
concluded
the
doctor
he
had
barely
finished
before
pitou
rushed
into
his
aunt
long
bony
arms
to
exchange
the
hug
which
he
wanted
to
be
in
token
of
eternal
separation
but
the
mention
of
a
sum
of
money
and
gilbert
movements
of
putting
his
hand
in
his
pocket
for
cash
with
the
chink
of
silver
set
the
warmth
of
greed
up
from
her
old
heart
lord
doctor
do
not
you
know
that
nobody
in
all
the
wide
world
can
love
this
poor
lone
lorn
thing
like
his
own
dear
fond
auntie
entwining
him
with
her
long
arms
she
imprinted
on
his
cheeks
a
couple
of
kisses
so
sour
that
they
made
his
hair
stand
on
end
and
then
curl
with
a
shriveling
up
just
what
i
thought
but
still
you
are
too
poor
to
do
the
proper
thing
nay
good
master
gilbert
said
the
pious
dame
forget
not
that
we
have
the
father
of
the
fatherless
above
and
that
he
has
promised
that
a
swallow
shall
not
be
sold
for
a
penny
without
its
being
spent
for
the
orphan
share
the
text
may
be
so
but
it
nowhere
says
that
the
orphan
is
to
be
bound
out
as
a
servant
i
am
afraid
to
do
with
ange
as
i
suggested
it
would
be
too
dear
for
your
slight
resources
but
with
the
sum
you
spoke
of
in
your
pocket
said
the
old
devotee
with
her
eyes
rivetted
on
the
place
whence
the
chink
had
sounded
i
would
give
it
assuredly
but
only
on
condition
that
the
boy
should
be
brought
up
to
some
livelihood
i
promise
that
cried
aunt
angelique
i
vow
it
as
true
as
the
sheep
are
tempered
for
the
and
she
raised
her
skeleton
hand
to
heaven
well
replied
gilbert
drawing
out
a
bag
rounded
with
coin
i
am
ready
to
deposit
the
funds
but
you
must
sign
a
contract
at
lawyer
niquet
niquet
was
her
own
business
man
and
she
raised
no
objections
a
bargain
was
made
for
five
years
ange
pitou
was
to
be
brought
up
to
some
trade
and
boarded
for
two
hundred
livres
to
his
aunt
the
doctor
paid
down
the
money
next
day
he
quitted
villers
after
arranging
matters
with
a
farmer
on
some
property
of
his
named
billet
whose
acquaintance
we
shall
make
in
good
time
miss
pitou
pouncing
on
the
first
payment
in
advance
of
the
maintenance
fund
buried
eight
bright
gold
pieces
in
her
armchair
bottom
with
eight
livres
over
she
put
the
small
change
waiting
to
make
up
the
amount
of
a
gold
piece
to
be
placed
when
converted
in
the
peculiar
we
noticed
the
scant
sympathy
ange
felt
for
his
aunt
he
had
foreseen
the
sorrow
disappointment
and
tribulations
awaiting
him
under
her
roof
in
the
first
place
as
soon
as
the
doctor
had
turned
his
back
there
was
no
longer
a
question
about
his
learning
any
trade
when
the
good
notary
made
a
remark
on
this
agreement
the
tender
aunt
rejoined
that
her
nephew
was
too
delicate
to
be
put
out
to
work
the
lawyer
had
admired
his
client
sensitive
heart
and
deferred
the
apprenticeship
question
for
another
year
he
was
only
twelve
so
that
it
would
not
waste
much
valuable
time
while
his
aunt
was
ruminating
how
to
evade
the
contract
ange
resumed
his
truant
life
in
the
woods
as
led
at
haramont
it
was
the
same
woods
and
hence
the
same
life
as
soon
as
he
had
the
best
spots
located
for
he
made
some
birdlime
and
having
a
loaf
under
his
arm
he
went
off
into
the
forest
for
the
whole
day
he
had
foreseen
a
storm
when
he
came
back
at
nightfall
but
he
expected
to
parry
it
with
the
proceeds
of
his
skill
he
had
not
presaged
how
the
tempest
would
fall
in
fact
aunt
angelique
had
ambushed
herself
behind
the
door
to
deal
him
a
cuff
as
he
crept
in
which
he
recognized
as
inflicted
by
her
hard
hand
happily
he
had
a
hard
head
too
and
though
the
blow
staggered
him
he
had
the
sense
left
to
hold
out
as
a
and
buckler
the
talisman
he
had
prepared
it
was
a
bunch
of
two
dozen
small
birds
what
is
this
challenged
his
aunt
continuing
to
grumble
for
sake
but
opening
her
eyes
more
widely
than
her
mouth
birds
you
see
good
aunt
angelique
replied
pitou
as
she
grabbed
the
lot
good
to
eat
questioned
the
old
maid
who
was
greedy
in
all
her
senses
of
the
word
redbreasts
and
larks
i
should
bet
they
are
good
to
eat
but
they
are
better
to
sell
they
command
a
good
price
in
the
market
where
did
you
steal
them
you
little
rogue
steal
they
ai
stolen
i
took
at
the
pool
in
the
woods
a
fellow
has
only
to
set
up
limed
twigs
anywhere
round
the
water
and
the
silly
birds
get
tangled
then
you
run
up
wring
their
necks
and
there
you
have
them
lime
do
you
catch
birds
with
lime
queried
angelique
not
mortar
lime
bless
your
innocence
but
birdlime
it
is
made
by
boiling
down
holly
sap
i
understand
but
where
did
you
get
the
money
to
buy
holly
sap
i
should
be
a
saphead
to
buy
that
one
makes
it
ah
then
these
birds
are
to
be
had
for
the
picking
up
yes
any
day
but
not
everyday
for
of
course
you
can
not
catch
on
tuesday
those
you
caught
on
monday
very
true
returned
the
aunt
amazed
at
the
brightness
her
nephew
was
for
once
displaying
you
are
right
this
unheard
of
approval
delighted
the
boy
but
on
the
days
when
you
ought
not
to
go
to
the
pools
you
go
elsewhere
when
you
are
not
catching
birds
you
snare
hares
you
can
eat
them
too
and
sell
the
skins
for
two
cents
angelique
stared
at
her
nephew
who
was
coming
out
as
a
financier
oh
i
can
do
the
selling
of
course
just
as
mother
madeline
did
for
pitou
had
never
supposed
he
was
to
enjoy
the
fruit
of
his
hunting
when
will
you
go
snaring
hares
she
asked
eagerly
i
will
go
snaring
hares
and
rabbits
when
i
have
wire
for
snares
all
right
make
it
oh
i
can
not
do
that
pitou
said
scratching
his
head
i
must
buy
that
at
the
store
but
i
can
weave
the
springes
what
does
it
cost
i
can
make
a
couple
of
dozen
with
four
cents
worth
and
it
ought
to
catch
half
a
dozen
bunnies
and
the
snares
are
used
over
and
over
again
unless
the
gamekeepers
seize
them
here
are
four
cents
said
aunt
angelique
go
and
buy
wire
and
get
the
rabbits
wire
was
cheaper
in
the
town
than
at
the
village
so
that
ange
got
material
for
snares
for
three
cents
he
brought
the
odd
copper
to
his
aunt
who
was
touched
by
this
honesty
for
an
instant
she
felt
like
giving
him
the
cent
but
unfortunately
for
ange
it
had
been
flattened
by
a
hammer
and
might
be
passed
in
the
dusk
for
a
twosous
piece
she
thought
it
wicked
to
squander
a
piece
that
might
bring
a
hundred
per
cent
and
she
popped
it
into
her
pouch
pitou
made
the
snares
and
in
the
morning
asked
mysteriously
for
a
bag
in
it
she
put
the
bread
and
cheese
for
his
meals
and
away
he
went
to
his
hunting
ground
meanwhile
she
plucked
the
robins
intended
for
their
dinner
she
took
a
brace
of
larks
to
abbe
fortier
and
two
brace
to
the
golden
ball
innkeeper
who
paid
her
three
cents
for
them
and
ordered
as
many
as
she
could
supply
at
that
rate
she
went
home
beaming
the
blessing
of
heaven
had
entered
the
house
with
ange
pitou
they
are
quite
right
who
say
a
good
action
is
never
thrown
away
she
observed
as
she
munched
the
robins
as
fat
as
ortolans
and
delicate
as
beccaficoes
at
dark
in
walked
ange
with
the
rounded
out
bag
on
his
shoulders
aunt
angelique
received
him
on
the
threshold
but
not
with
a
slap
here
i
am
with
my
bag
said
he
with
the
calmness
of
having
well
spent
his
day
and
what
have
you
in
the
bag
cried
the
aunt
stretching
out
her
hand
in
sharp
curiosity
replied
pitou
it
is
this
way
if
daddy
lajeunesse
the
gamekeeper
saw
me
rambling
without
the
bag
he
would
want
to
know
what
i
was
lurking
for
and
he
would
feel
suspicion
but
when
he
challenged
me
with
the
bag
i
just
answered
him
am
gathering
beechmast
father
it
is
not
forbidden
to
gather
mast
is
it
and
not
being
forbidden
he
could
not
do
anything
so
he
said
nothing
except
have
a
good
aunt
pitou
give
her
my
compliments
so
you
have
been
collecting
mast
instead
of
catching
rabbits
cried
aunt
angelique
angrily
no
no
i
laid
my
snares
under
cover
of
the
old
donkey
saw
me
doing
that
and
thought
it
right
but
the
game
said
the
woman
bent
on
the
first
principle
the
moon
will
be
up
at
twelve
and
i
will
go
and
see
how
many
i
have
snared
you
will
go
into
the
woods
at
midnight
why
not
what
is
there
to
be
afraid
of
the
woman
was
as
amazed
at
ange
courage
as
at
the
breadth
of
his
speculations
but
brought
up
in
the
woods
ange
was
not
to
be
scared
at
what
terrifies
the
town
boy
so
at
midnight
he
set
out
skirting
the
cemetery
wall
for
the
innocent
lad
never
in
his
ideas
offending
anybody
had
no
more
fear
of
the
dead
than
of
the
living
the
only
person
he
dreaded
was
lajeunesse
so
he
made
a
turn
round
his
house
and
stopped
to
imitate
the
barking
of
a
dog
so
naturally
that
the
gamekeeper
basset
snorer
deceived
by
the
provocation
replied
with
a
full
throat
and
came
to
the
door
to
sniff
the
air
pitou
ran
on
chuckling
for
if
snorer
were
home
his
master
was
surely
asleep
there
as
the
man
and
the
dog
were
inseparable
in
the
snares
two
rabbits
had
been
strangled
pitou
stuffed
them
into
the
pockets
of
a
coat
made
too
long
for
him
and
now
too
small
greed
kept
the
aunt
awake
though
she
had
lain
down
she
had
reckoned
on
two
brace
of
game
only
a
pair
said
pitou
it
is
not
my
fault
that
i
have
not
done
better
but
these
are
the
cunningest
rabbits
for
miles
round
next
day
pitou
renewed
his
enterprises
and
had
the
luck
to
catch
three
rabbits
two
went
to
the
tavern
and
one
to
abbe
fortier
who
recommended
aunt
angelique
to
the
benevolent
of
the
town
thus
things
went
on
for
three
or
four
months
the
woman
enchanted
and
ange
thinking
life
endurable
except
for
his
mother
loss
matters
were
such
as
at
haramont
he
passed
his
time
in
rural
pleasures
but
an
unexpected
circumstance
broke
the
jar
of
illusion
of
the
prude
and
stopped
the
nephew
trapping
a
letter
from
gilbert
arrived
from
new
york
he
had
not
forgotten
his
little
ward
on
landing
but
asked
master
niquet
if
his
instructions
had
been
followed
and
if
young
pitou
were
learning
the
means
to
make
his
own
living
it
was
a
pinch
for
there
was
no
denying
that
ange
was
in
health
he
was
tall
and
lank
but
so
are
hickory
saplings
and
nobody
doubts
their
strength
and
elasticity
the
aunt
asked
a
week
to
put
in
her
reply
it
was
miserable
for
both
pitou
asked
no
better
career
than
he
was
leading
but
it
was
quiet
at
the
time
not
only
did
the
cold
weather
drive
the
birds
away
but
the
snow
fell
and
as
it
would
retain
footprints
he
dared
not
go
into
the
woods
to
lay
traps
and
snares
during
the
week
the
old
maid
claws
grew
she
made
the
stripling
so
wretched
that
he
was
ready
to
take
up
any
trade
rather
than
be
her
butt
any
longer
suddenly
a
sublime
idea
sprouted
in
her
cruelly
tormented
brain
where
peace
reigned
again
father
fortier
had
two
purses
for
poor
students
attached
to
his
school
out
of
the
bounty
of
the
duke
of
orleans
angelique
resolved
to
beg
him
to
enter
ange
for
one
of
them
this
would
cost
the
teacher
nothing
and
to
say
nothing
of
the
game
on
which
the
woman
had
been
nourishing
the
doctor
for
half
a
year
he
owed
something
to
the
letter
indeed
ange
was
received
without
fee
by
the
schoolmaster
the
old
girl
was
delighted
for
it
was
the
school
of
the
district
where
gilbert
son
was
educated
he
paid
fifty
livres
and
ange
got
in
for
nothing
but
nobody
was
to
let
sebastian
gilbert
or
any
others
know
that
whether
they
guessed
this
or
not
ange
was
received
by
his
school
fellows
with
that
sweet
spirit
of
brotherhood
born
among
children
and
perpetuated
among
the
grown
ups
in
other
words
with
hooting
and
teasing
but
when
three
or
four
of
the
budding
tyrants
made
the
acquaintance
of
pitou
enormous
fist
and
were
trodden
under
his
even
more
enormous
foot
respect
began
to
be
diffused
he
would
have
had
a
life
a
shade
less
worried
than
when
under
angelique
wing
but
father
fortier
in
soliciting
little
children
to
come
unto
him
forgot
to
warn
them
that
the
hands
he
held
out
were
armed
with
the
latin
rudiments
and
birch
rods
little
did
the
aunt
care
whether
the
information
was
flogged
or
insinuated
mentally
into
her
nephew
she
basked
in
the
golden
ray
from
dreamland
that
in
three
years
ange
would
pass
the
examination
and
be
sent
to
college
with
the
orleans
purse
then
would
he
become
a
priest
when
he
would
of
course
make
his
aunt
his
housekeeper
one
day
a
rough
awakening
came
to
this
delusion
ange
crawled
into
the
house
as
if
shod
in
lead
what
is
the
matter
cried
aunt
who
had
never
seen
a
more
piteous
mien
are
you
hungry
no
replied
pitou
dolefully
the
hearer
was
uneasy
for
illness
is
a
cause
of
alarm
to
good
mothers
and
bad
godmothers
as
it
forces
expenses
it
is
a
great
misfortune
pitou
blubbered
father
fortier
sends
me
home
from
school
so
no
more
studies
no
examination
no
purse
no
college
his
sobs
changed
into
howls
while
the
woman
stared
at
him
to
try
to
read
in
his
soul
the
reason
for
this
expulsion
i
suppose
you
have
been
playing
truant
again
she
said
i
hear
that
you
are
always
roaming
round
farmer
billet
place
to
catch
a
sight
of
his
daughter
catherine
fie
fie
very
pretty
conduct
in
a
future
priest
ange
shook
his
head
you
lie
shrieked
the
old
maid
with
her
anger
rising
with
the
growing
certainty
that
it
was
a
serious
scrape
last
sunday
you
were
again
seen
rambling
in
with
kate
billet
it
was
she
who
fibbed
but
she
was
one
who
believed
the
end
justified
the
means
and
a
might
be
caught
by
throwing
out
a
oh
no
they
could
not
have
seen
me
there
cried
ange
for
we
were
out
by
the
there
you
wretch
you
see
you
were
with
her
but
this
is
not
a
matter
that
miss
billet
is
concerned
in
ventured
ange
blushing
like
the
overgrown
boy
of
sixteen
that
he
was
yes
call
her
to
pretend
you
have
any
respect
for
her
the
flirt
the
jilt
the
mincing
minx
i
will
tell
her
father
confessor
how
she
is
carrying
on
but
i
take
my
bible
oath
that
she
is
not
a
flirt
you
defend
her
when
you
need
all
the
excuses
you
can
rake
up
for
yourself
this
is
going
on
fine
what
is
the
world
coming
to
when
children
of
sixteen
are
walking
arm
in
arm
under
the
shade
trees
but
aunt
you
are
away
out
catherine
will
not
let
me
her
she
keeps
me
off
at
you
see
how
you
break
down
your
own
denials
you
are
calling
her
catherine
plain
now
oh
why
not
kate
or
kitty
or
some
such
silly
nickname
which
you
use
in
your
iniquitous
familiarity
she
drives
you
away
to
have
you
come
nearer
they
all
do
do
they
there
i
never
thought
of
that
exclaimed
the
swain
suddenly
enlightened
ah
you
will
have
something
else
to
think
of
and
she
said
the
old
prude
i
will
manage
all
this
i
will
ask
father
fortier
to
lock
you
up
on
bread
and
water
for
a
fortnight
and
have
her
put
in
a
nunnery
if
she
can
not
moderate
her
fancy
for
you
she
spoke
so
emphatically
that
pitou
was
frightened
you
are
altogether
wrong
my
good
aunt
pleaded
he
clasping
his
hands
miss
catherine
has
nothing
to
do
with
my
misfortune
impurity
is
the
mother
of
all
the
vices
returned
angelique
sententiously
but
impurity
has
nothing
to
do
with
my
being
turned
out
of
school
objected
the
youth
the
teacher
put
me
out
because
i
made
too
many
barbarisms
and
solecisms
which
prevent
me
of
having
any
chance
to
win
that
purse
what
will
become
of
you
then
blest
if
i
know
wailed
pitou
who
had
never
looked
upon
priesthood
with
aunt
as
housekeeper
as
paradise
on
earth
let
come
what
providence
pleases
he
sighed
lamentably
raising
his
eyes
providence
do
you
call
it
i
see
you
have
got
hold
of
these
newfangled
ideas
about
philosophy
that
can
not
be
aunt
for
i
can
not
go
into
philosophy
till
i
have
passed
rhetoric
and
i
am
only
in
the
third
course
joke
away
sneered
the
old
maid
to
whom
the
was
greek
i
speak
of
the
philosophy
of
these
philosophers
not
what
a
pious
man
like
the
priest
would
allow
in
his
holy
house
you
are
a
serpent
and
you
have
been
gnawing
a
file
of
the
newspapers
in
which
these
dreadful
writers
insult
king
and
queen
and
the
church
he
is
lost
when
aunt
angelique
said
her
ward
was
lost
she
meant
that
she
was
ruined
the
danger
was
imminent
she
took
the
sublime
resolution
to
run
to
father
fortier
for
explanation
and
above
all
to
try
to
patch
up
the
breach
chapter
iii
a
revolutionary
farmer
the
departure
of
his
aunt
gave
pitou
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
tranquillity
he
wanted
to
utilize
it
he
gathered
the
crumbs
of
his
aunt
meal
to
feed
his
lizards
he
was
a
naturalist
who
was
never
without
pets
caught
some
flies
for
his
ants
and
frogs
and
opened
the
cupboard
and
to
get
a
supply
of
food
for
himself
appetite
had
come
to
him
with
the
lonesomeness
his
preparations
made
for
a
feast
he
went
back
to
the
doorway
so
as
not
to
be
surprised
by
the
woman
return
while
he
was
watching
a
pretty
maid
passed
the
end
of
the
street
riding
on
the
crupper
of
a
horse
laden
with
two
panniers
one
was
filled
with
pigeons
the
other
with
pullets
this
was
catherine
billet
who
smiled
on
pitou
and
stopped
on
seeing
him
according
to
his
habit
he
turned
red
as
a
beet
with
gaping
mouth
he
glared
we
mean
admired
kate
billet
the
last
expression
of
feminine
beauty
to
him
she
looked
up
and
down
the
street
nodded
to
her
worshipper
and
kept
on
in
her
way
pitou
trembling
with
delight
as
he
nodded
back
absorbed
in
his
contemplation
he
did
not
perceive
his
relative
on
the
return
from
fortier
suddenly
she
grabbed
his
hand
while
turning
pale
with
anger
abruptly
roused
from
his
bright
dream
by
the
electric
shock
always
caused
by
aunt
angelique
grasp
the
youth
wheeled
and
saw
with
horror
that
she
was
holding
up
his
hand
which
was
in
turn
holding
half
a
loaf
with
two
most
liberal
smears
of
butter
and
another
of
white
cheese
applied
to
it
the
woman
yelled
with
fury
and
pitou
groaned
with
fright
she
raised
her
other
hand
and
he
lowered
his
head
she
darted
for
the
broom
and
the
other
dropped
the
food
and
took
to
his
heels
without
any
farewell
speech
those
two
hearts
knew
one
another
and
understood
that
they
could
not
get
on
together
any
more
angelique
bounced
indoors
and
locked
with
a
double
turn
of
the
key
the
grating
sound
seemed
a
renewal
of
the
tempest
to
the
fugitive
who
put
on
the
pace
the
result
was
an
event
the
aunt
was
as
far
from
expecting
as
the
young
man
himself
running
as
though
all
the
fiends
from
below
were
at
his
heels
pitou
was
soon
beyond
the
town
bounds
on
turning
the
wall
he
bunked
up
against
a
horse
good
gracious
cried
a
sweet
voice
to
the
flyer
wherever
are
you
racing
so
master
ange
you
nearly
made
younker
take
the
bit
in
his
teeth
with
the
scare
you
gave
us
oh
miss
catherine
what
a
misfortune
is
on
me
replied
pitou
wide
of
the
question
you
alarm
me
said
the
girl
pulling
up
in
the
what
is
wrong
i
can
not
be
a
priest
returned
the
young
fellow
as
if
revealing
a
world
of
iniquities
you
wo
said
the
maid
roaring
with
laughter
instead
of
throwing
up
her
hands
as
pitou
expected
become
a
soldier
then
you
must
not
make
a
fuss
over
such
a
trifle
really
i
thought
your
aunt
had
kicked
the
bucket
it
is
much
the
same
thing
for
she
has
kicked
me
out
lor
no
for
you
have
not
the
pleasure
of
mourning
for
her
observed
catherine
billet
laughing
more
heartily
than
before
which
scandalized
the
nephew
you
are
a
lucky
one
to
be
able
to
laugh
like
that
and
it
proves
you
have
a
merry
heart
and
the
sorrows
of
others
make
no
impression
on
you
who
tells
you
that
i
should
not
feel
for
you
if
you
met
a
real
grief
real
when
i
have
not
a
feather
to
fly
with
all
for
the
best
returned
the
peasant
girl
but
how
about
eating
retorted
pitou
a
fellow
must
eat
and
i
am
always
sharp
set
do
you
like
to
work
what
am
i
to
work
at
whined
he
my
aunt
and
father
fortier
have
repeated
a
hundred
times
that
i
am
good
for
nothing
ah
if
i
had
been
bound
prentice
to
a
wheelwright
or
a
carpenter
instead
of
their
trying
to
make
a
priest
of
me
upon
my
faith
miss
catherine
a
curse
is
on
me
said
he
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
in
desperation
alack
sighed
the
girl
who
knew
like
everybody
the
melancholy
tale
there
is
truth
in
what
you
say
my
poor
pitou
but
there
is
one
thing
you
might
do
do
tell
me
what
that
is
cried
the
youth
jumping
towards
the
coming
suggestion
as
a
drowning
man
leaps
for
a
twig
of
willow
you
have
a
guardian
in
gilbert
whose
son
is
your
schoolfellow
i
should
rather
think
he
was
and
by
the
same
token
i
have
taken
many
floggings
for
him
why
not
apply
to
his
father
who
certainly
will
not
shake
you
off
that
would
be
all
right
if
i
knew
where
to
address
him
but
your
father
may
know
as
he
farms
some
of
his
land
i
know
that
he
sends
some
of
the
rent
to
america
and
banks
the
other
part
here
at
a
notary
america
is
a
far
cry
moaned
pitou
what
would
you
start
for
america
exclaimed
the
maid
almost
frightened
at
his
courage
me
sakes
no
never
france
is
good
enough
for
me
if
i
could
get
enough
to
eat
and
drink
very
well
said
she
falling
into
silence
which
lasted
some
time
the
lad
was
plunged
into
a
thoughtful
mood
which
would
have
much
puzzled
teacher
fortier
the
logical
man
starting
from
obscurity
the
reverie
brightened
and
then
grew
confused
again
like
lightning
younker
had
started
in
again
for
the
walk
home
and
pitou
with
a
hand
on
one
basket
trudged
on
beside
it
as
dreamy
as
her
neighbor
catherine
let
the
bridle
drop
with
no
fear
about
being
run
away
with
there
were
no
monsters
on
the
highway
and
younker
bore
no
resemblance
to
the
fabulous
hippogriffs
the
walker
stopped
mechanically
when
the
animal
did
which
was
at
the
farm
hello
is
this
you
pitou
challenged
a
man
proudly
stationed
before
a
drinking
pool
where
his
horse
was
swilling
it
is
me
master
billet
he
had
another
mishap
said
the
maid
jumping
off
the
horse
without
any
heed
as
to
showing
her
ankles
his
aunt
has
sent
him
packing
what
has
he
done
to
worry
the
old
bigot
this
time
queried
the
farmer
it
appears
that
i
am
not
good
enough
in
greek
said
the
scholar
who
was
lying
for
it
was
latin
he
was
a
bungler
at
what
do
you
want
to
be
good
at
greek
for
asked
the
man
to
explain
theocritus
and
read
the
iliad
these
are
useful
when
you
want
to
be
a
priest
trash
said
billet
do
you
need
greek
and
latin
do
i
know
my
own
language
can
i
read
or
write
but
this
does
not
prevent
me
plowing
sowing
and
reaping
but
you
master
billet
are
a
cultivator
and
not
a
priest
says
virgil
do
not
you
think
a
farmer
is
on
a
level
with
a
larned
clerk
you
cussed
particularly
when
the
has
a
hundred
acres
of
tilled
land
in
the
sun
and
a
thousand
louis
in
the
shade
i
have
always
been
told
that
a
priest
leads
the
happiest
life
though
i
grant
added
pitou
smiling
most
amiably
i
do
not
believe
all
i
hear
you
are
my
boy
by
a
blamed
you
see
i
can
make
rhymes
if
i
like
to
try
it
strikes
me
that
you
have
the
makings
in
you
of
something
better
than
a
scholard
and
that
it
is
a
deused
lucky
thing
that
you
try
something
else
mainly
at
the
present
time
as
a
farmer
i
know
which
way
the
wind
blows
and
it
is
rough
for
priests
so
then
as
you
are
an
honest
lad
and
larned
here
pitou
bowed
at
being
so
styled
for
the
first
time
you
can
get
along
without
the
black
gown
catherine
who
was
setting
the
chickens
and
pigeons
on
the
ground
was
listening
with
interest
to
the
dialogue
it
looks
hard
to
win
a
livelihood
said
the
lad
what
do
you
know
how
to
do
i
can
make
birdlime
and
snare
game
i
can
mock
the
birds
songs
eh
miss
kate
he
can
whistle
like
a
blackbird
but
whistling
is
not
a
trade
commented
billet
just
what
i
say
to
myself
by
jingo
oh
you
can
swear
that
is
a
manly
accomplishment
any
how
oh
did
i
i
beg
your
pardon
farmer
do
mention
it
said
the
rustic
i
rip
out
myself
sometimes
thunder
and
blazes
he
roared
to
his
horse
ca
you
be
quiet
these
devilish
percherons
must
always
be
grazing
and
jerking
are
you
lazy
he
continued
to
the
lad
i
do
know
i
have
never
worked
at
anything
but
learning
greek
and
latin
and
they
do
not
tempt
me
much
a
good
job
that
shows
that
you
are
not
such
a
fool
as
i
took
you
for
said
billet
his
hearer
opened
his
eyes
immeasurably
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
heard
this
order
of
ideas
subversive
of
all
the
theories
set
up
for
him
previously
i
mean
are
you
easily
tired
out
bless
you
i
can
go
ten
leagues
and
never
feel
it
good
we
are
getting
on
we
might
train
you
a
trifle
lower
and
make
some
money
on
you
as
a
runner
train
me
lower
said
pitou
looking
at
his
slender
figure
bony
arms
and
legs
i
fancy
i
am
thin
now
as
it
is
in
fact
you
are
a
treasure
my
friend
replied
the
yeoman
bursting
into
laughter
pitou
was
stepping
from
one
surprise
to
another
never
had
he
been
esteemed
so
highly
in
short
how
are
you
at
work
do
know
for
i
never
have
worked
the
girl
laughed
but
her
father
took
the
matter
seriously
these
rogues
of
larned
folk
he
broke
forth
shaking
his
fist
at
the
town
look
at
them
training
up
the
youth
in
the
way
they
should
not
go
in
laziness
and
idleness
what
good
is
such
a
sluggard
to
his
brothers
i
want
to
know
not
much
said
pitou
luckily
i
have
no
brothers
by
brothers
i
mean
all
mankind
continued
the
farmer
are
not
all
men
brothers
hey
the
scripture
says
so
and
equals
proceeded
the
other
that
is
another
matter
said
the
younger
man
if
i
had
been
the
equal
of
father
fortier
i
guess
he
would
not
have
given
me
the
whip
so
often
if
i
were
the
equal
of
my
aunt
she
would
not
have
driven
me
from
home
i
tell
you
that
all
men
are
brothers
and
we
shall
soon
prove
this
to
the
tyrants
said
billet
i
will
take
you
into
my
house
to
prove
it
you
will
but
just
think
i
eat
three
pounds
of
bread
a
day
with
butter
and
cheese
to
boot
pooh
i
see
you
will
not
be
dear
to
feed
said
the
farmer
we
will
keep
you
have
you
nothing
else
to
ask
father
pitou
inquired
catherine
nothing
miss
what
did
you
come
along
for
just
to
keep
you
company
well
you
are
gallant
and
i
accept
the
compliment
for
what
it
is
worth
said
the
girl
but
you
came
to
ask
news
about
your
guardian
pitou
so
i
did
that
is
funny
i
forgot
it
you
want
to
speak
about
our
worthy
dr
gilbert
said
the
farmer
with
a
tone
indicating
the
degree
of
deep
consideration
in
which
he
held
his
landlord
just
so
answered
pitou
but
i
am
not
in
need
now
since
you
house
me
i
can
tranquilly
wait
till
he
returns
from
america
you
will
not
have
to
wait
long
for
he
has
returned
you
do
say
so
when
i
can
not
exactly
say
but
he
was
at
havre
a
week
ago
for
i
have
a
parcel
in
my
saddlebags
that
comes
from
him
and
was
handed
me
at
villers
cotterets
and
here
it
is
how
do
you
know
it
is
from
him
because
there
is
a
letter
in
it
excuse
me
daddy
interrupted
catherine
but
you
boast
that
you
can
not
read
so
i
do
i
want
folks
to
say
is
old
farmer
billet
who
owes
nothing
to
nobody
not
even
the
schoolmaster
for
he
has
made
himself
all
alone
i
did
not
read
the
letter
but
the
rural
constabulary
whom
i
met
there
what
does
he
say
that
he
still
is
content
with
you
judge
for
yourself
out
of
a
leather
wallet
he
took
a
letter
which
he
held
to
his
daughter
who
read
my
dear
friend
billet
i
arrive
from
america
where
i
found
a
people
richer
greater
and
happier
than
ours
this
arises
from
their
being
free
while
we
are
not
but
we
are
marching
towards
this
new
era
and
all
must
labor
for
the
light
to
come
i
know
your
principles
friend
billet
and
your
influence
on
the
farmers
your
neighbors
and
all
the
honest
population
of
toilers
and
hands
whom
you
lead
not
like
a
king
but
a
father
teach
them
the
principles
of
devotion
and
brotherhood
i
know
you
cherish
philosophy
is
universal
all
men
ought
to
read
their
rights
and
duties
by
its
light
i
send
you
a
little
book
in
which
these
rights
and
duties
are
set
forth
it
is
my
work
though
my
name
is
not
on
the
propagate
these
principles
those
of
universal
equality
get
them
read
in
the
winter
evenings
reading
is
the
food
of
the
mind
as
bread
is
that
for
the
body
one
of
these
days
i
shall
see
you
and
tell
you
about
a
new
kind
of
farming
practiced
in
the
united
states
it
consists
in
the
landlord
and
the
tenant
working
on
shares
of
the
crop
it
appears
to
me
more
according
to
the
laws
of
primitive
society
and
to
the
love
of
god
greeting
and
brotherly
feeling
honore
gilbert
citizen
of
philadelphia
this
letter
is
nicely
written
observed
pitou
i
warrant
it
is
said
billet
yes
father
dear
but
i
doubt
the
will
be
of
your
opinion
because
this
not
only
will
get
gilbert
into
trouble
but
you
too
pooh
you
are
always
scarey
sneered
the
farmer
this
does
not
hinder
me
having
the
book
and
we
have
got
something
for
you
to
do
pitou
you
shall
read
me
this
in
the
evenings
but
in
the
daytime
tend
the
sheep
and
cows
let
us
have
a
squint
at
the
book
he
took
out
one
of
those
sewn
pamphlets
in
a
red
cover
issued
in
great
quantity
in
those
days
with
or
without
permission
of
the
authorities
in
the
latter
case
the
author
ran
great
risk
of
being
sent
to
prison
read
us
the
title
pitou
till
we
have
a
peep
at
the
book
inside
the
rest
afterwards
the
boy
read
on
the
first
page
these
words
which
usage
has
made
vague
and
meaningless
lately
but
at
that
epoch
they
had
a
deep
effect
on
all
hearts
on
the
independence
of
man
and
the
freedom
of
nations
what
do
you
say
to
that
my
lad
cried
the
farmer
why
it
seems
to
me
that
independence
and
freedom
are
much
of
a
muchness
my
guardian
would
be
whipped
out
of
the
class
by
father
fortier
for
being
guilty
of
a
pleonasm
fleanism
or
not
this
book
is
the
work
of
a
real
man
rejoined
the
other
never
mind
father
said
catherine
with
the
admirable
instinct
of
womankind
i
beg
you
to
hide
the
book
it
will
get
you
into
some
bad
scrape
i
tremble
merely
to
look
at
it
why
should
it
do
me
any
harm
when
it
has
not
brought
it
on
the
writer
how
do
you
know
that
father
this
letter
was
written
a
week
ago
and
took
all
that
time
to
arrive
from
havre
but
i
had
a
letter
this
morning
from
sebastian
gilbert
at
paris
who
sends
his
love
to
his
i
forgot
that
and
he
has
been
three
days
without
his
father
meeting
him
there
she
is
right
said
pitou
this
delay
is
alarming
hold
your
tongue
you
timid
creature
and
let
us
read
the
treatise
said
the
farmer
it
will
not
only
make
you
larned
but
manly
pitou
stuck
the
book
under
his
arm
with
so
solemn
a
movement
that
it
completed
the
winning
of
his
protector
heart
have
you
had
your
dinner
asked
he
no
sir
replied
the
youth
he
was
eating
when
he
was
driven
from
home
said
the
girl
well
you
go
in
and
ask
mother
billet
for
the
usual
rations
and
we
will
set
you
regularly
to
work
with
an
eloquent
look
the
orphan
thanked
him
and
conducted
by
catherine
he
entered
the
kitchen
governed
by
the
absolute
rule
of
mother
billet
chapter
iv
long
legs
are
good
for
running
if
not
for
dancing
mistress
billet
was
a
fat
woman
who
honored
her
husband
delighted
in
her
daughter
and
fed
her
field
hands
as
no
other
housewife
did
for
miles
around
so
there
was
a
rush
to
be
employed
at
billet
pitou
appreciated
his
luck
at
the
full
value
when
he
saw
the
golden
loaf
placed
at
his
elbow
the
pot
of
cider
set
on
his
right
and
the
chunk
of
bacon
before
him
since
he
lost
his
mother
five
years
before
the
orphan
had
never
enjoyed
such
cheer
even
on
a
feast
day
he
remembered
too
that
his
new
duties
of
neatherd
and
shepherd
had
been
fulfilled
by
gods
and
demigods
besides
billet
had
the
management
of
the
kine
and
orders
were
not
harsh
from
catherine
mouth
you
shall
stay
here
said
she
i
have
made
father
understand
that
you
are
good
for
a
heap
of
things
for
instance
you
can
keep
the
accounts
well
i
know
the
four
rules
of
arithmetic
said
pitou
proudly
you
are
one
ahead
of
me
here
you
stay
i
am
glad
for
i
could
not
live
afar
from
you
oh
i
beg
pardon
but
that
came
from
my
heart
i
do
not
bear
you
ill
will
for
that
said
catherine
it
is
not
your
fault
if
you
like
us
here
poor
young
lambs
they
say
so
much
in
so
few
words
so
pitou
did
much
of
catherine
work
and
she
had
more
time
to
make
pretty
caps
and
titivate
herself
up
to
use
her
mother
words
i
think
you
prettier
without
a
cap
on
he
remarked
you
may
but
your
taste
is
not
the
rule
i
can
not
go
over
to
the
town
and
dance
without
a
cap
on
that
is
all
very
well
for
fine
ladies
who
have
the
right
to
go
bareheaded
and
wear
powder
on
the
hair
you
beat
them
all
without
powder
compliments
again
did
you
learn
to
make
them
at
fortier
no
he
taught
nothing
like
that
dancing
lord
help
us
dancing
at
fortier
he
made
us
cut
capers
at
the
end
of
the
birch
so
you
do
not
know
how
to
dance
still
you
shall
come
along
with
me
on
sunday
and
see
master
isidor
charny
dance
he
is
the
best
dancer
of
all
the
gentlemen
round
here
who
is
he
owner
of
boursiennes
manor
he
will
dance
with
me
next
sunday
pitou
heart
shrank
without
his
knowing
why
so
you
make
yourself
lovely
to
dance
with
him
he
inquired
with
him
and
all
the
rest
you
too
if
you
like
to
learn
next
day
he
applied
himself
to
the
new
accomplishment
and
had
to
acknowledge
that
tuition
is
agreeable
according
to
the
tutor
in
two
hours
he
had
a
very
good
idea
of
the
art
ah
if
you
had
taught
me
latin
i
do
believe
i
should
have
made
so
many
mistakes
he
sighed
but
then
you
would
be
a
priest
and
be
shut
up
in
an
ugly
old
monastery
where
no
women
are
allowed
that
so
well
i
am
not
sorry
i
am
not
to
be
a
priest
at
breakfast
billet
reminded
his
new
man
that
the
reading
of
the
gilbert
pamphlet
was
to
take
place
in
the
barn
at
ten
next
day
that
was
the
hour
for
mass
pitou
objected
just
why
i
pitch
on
it
to
test
my
lads
replied
the
farmer
billet
detested
religious
leaders
as
the
apostles
of
tyranny
and
seized
the
opportunity
of
setting
up
one
altar
against
another
his
wife
and
daughter
raising
some
remonstrance
he
said
that
church
was
good
enough
for
womanfolks
no
doubt
and
they
might
go
and
sleep
away
their
time
there
but
it
suited
men
to
hear
stronger
stuff
or
else
the
men
should
not
work
on
his
land
billet
was
a
despot
in
his
house
only
catherine
ever
coped
with
him
and
she
was
hushed
when
he
frowned
but
she
thought
to
gain
something
for
pitou
on
the
occasion
she
pointed
out
that
the
doctrines
might
suffer
by
the
mouthpiece
that
the
reader
was
too
shabby
for
the
phrases
to
make
a
mark
so
pitou
was
agreeably
surprised
when
sunday
morning
came
round
to
see
the
tailor
enter
while
he
was
ruminating
how
he
could
clean
up
and
lay
on
a
chair
a
coat
and
breeches
of
sky
blue
cloth
and
a
long
waistcoat
of
white
and
pink
stripes
at
the
same
time
a
housemaid
came
in
to
put
on
another
chair
opposite
the
first
a
shirt
and
a
neckcloth
if
the
former
fitted
she
was
to
make
it
was
the
day
for
surprises
behind
the
two
came
the
hatter
who
brought
a
hat
of
the
latest
fashion
so
full
of
style
and
elegance
that
nothing
better
was
worn
in
villers
cotterets
the
only
trouble
was
that
the
shoes
were
too
small
for
ange
the
man
had
made
them
on
the
last
of
his
son
who
was
four
years
the
senior
of
pitou
this
superiority
of
our
friend
made
him
proud
for
a
space
but
it
was
spoilt
by
his
fear
that
he
would
have
to
go
to
the
ball
in
his
old
shoes
which
would
mar
the
new
suit
this
uneasiness
was
of
short
duration
a
pair
of
shoes
sent
for
father
billet
were
brought
at
the
same
time
and
they
fitted
pitou
a
fact
kept
hidden
from
billet
who
might
not
like
his
new
man
literally
stepping
into
his
own
shoes
when
pitou
dressed
hatted
shod
and
his
hair
dressed
looked
at
himself
in
the
mirror
he
did
not
know
himself
he
grinned
approvingly
and
said
as
he
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
fetch
along
your
master
charnys
now
my
eyes
cried
the
farmer
admiring
him
as
much
as
the
women
when
he
strutted
into
the
main
room
you
have
turned
out
a
strapper
my
lad
i
should
like
aunt
angelique
to
see
you
thus
togged
out
she
would
want
you
home
again
but
papa
she
could
not
take
him
back
could
she
as
long
as
he
is
a
minor
unless
she
forfeited
her
right
by
driving
him
out
but
the
five
years
are
over
said
pitou
quickly
for
which
gilbert
paid
a
thousand
francs
there
is
a
man
for
you
exclaimed
billet
just
think
that
i
am
always
hearing
such
good
deeds
of
his
d
see
it
is
life
and
death
for
him
and
he
raised
his
hand
to
heaven
he
wanted
me
to
learn
a
trade
went
on
the
youth
quite
right
of
him
see
how
the
best
intentions
are
given
a
twist
a
thousand
francs
are
left
to
fit
a
lad
for
the
battle
of
life
and
they
put
him
in
a
priest
school
to
make
a
of
him
how
much
did
your
aunt
give
old
fortier
nothing
then
she
pocketed
master
gilbert
money
it
is
likely
enough
mark
ye
pitou
i
have
a
bit
of
a
hint
to
give
you
when
the
old
humbug
of
a
saint
cracks
her
whistle
look
into
the
boxes
demijohns
and
old
crocks
for
she
has
been
hiding
her
savings
but
to
business
have
you
the
gilbert
book
here
in
my
pocket
have
you
thought
the
matter
over
father
said
catherine
good
actions
do
not
want
any
thought
replied
the
farmer
the
doctor
bade
me
have
the
book
read
and
the
good
principles
sown
the
book
shall
be
read
and
the
principles
scattered
but
we
can
go
to
church
ventured
the
maid
timidly
mother
and
you
can
go
to
the
pew
yes
but
we
men
have
better
to
do
come
alone
pitou
my
man
pitou
bowed
to
the
ladies
as
well
as
the
tight
coat
allowed
and
followed
the
farmer
proud
to
be
called
a
man
the
gathering
in
the
barn
was
numerous
billet
was
highly
esteemed
by
his
hired
men
and
they
did
not
mind
his
roaring
at
them
as
long
as
he
boarded
and
lodged
them
bounteously
so
they
had
all
hastened
to
come
at
his
invitation
besides
at
this
period
the
strange
fever
ran
through
france
felt
when
a
nation
is
going
to
go
to
work
new
and
strange
words
were
current
in
mouths
never
pronouncing
them
freedom
independence
emancipation
were
heard
not
only
among
the
lower
classes
but
from
the
nobility
in
the
first
place
so
that
the
popular
voice
was
but
their
echo
from
the
west
came
the
light
which
illumined
before
it
burnt
the
sun
rose
in
the
great
republic
of
america
which
was
to
be
in
its
round
a
vast
conflagration
for
france
by
the
beams
of
which
frightened
nations
were
to
see
freedom
inscribed
in
letters
of
blood
so
political
meetings
were
less
rare
than
might
be
supposed
apostles
of
an
unknown
deity
sprang
up
from
heaven
knows
where
and
went
from
town
to
town
disseminating
words
of
hope
those
at
the
head
of
the
government
found
certain
wheels
clogged
without
understanding
where
the
hindrance
lay
opposition
was
in
all
minds
before
it
appeared
in
hands
and
limbs
but
it
was
present
sensible
and
the
more
menacing
as
it
was
intangible
like
a
spectre
and
could
be
premised
before
it
was
grappled
with
twenty
and
more
farmers
field
hands
and
neighbors
of
billet
were
in
the
barn
when
their
friend
walked
in
with
pitou
all
heads
were
uncovered
and
all
hats
waved
at
it
was
plain
that
these
men
were
willing
to
die
at
the
master
call
the
farmer
explained
that
the
book
was
by
gilbert
which
the
young
man
was
about
to
read
out
the
doctor
was
in
the
district
where
he
owned
much
land
while
billet
was
his
principal
tenant
a
cask
was
ready
for
the
reader
who
scrambled
upon
it
and
began
his
task
common
folks
i
may
almost
say
people
in
general
listen
with
the
most
attention
to
words
they
do
not
clearly
understand
the
full
sense
of
the
pamphlet
escaped
the
keenest
wits
here
and
billet
as
well
but
in
the
midst
of
the
cloudy
phrases
shone
the
words
freedom
independence
and
equality
like
lightnings
in
the
dark
and
that
was
enough
for
the
applause
to
break
forth
hurrah
for
dr
gilbert
was
shouted
when
the
book
was
read
a
third
through
it
was
resolved
to
have
the
rest
in
two
more
sessions
next
time
on
the
sunday
coming
when
all
hands
promised
to
attend
pitou
had
read
very
well
nothing
succeeds
like
success
he
took
his
share
in
the
cheers
for
the
language
and
billet
himself
felt
some
respect
arise
for
the
dismissed
pupil
of
father
fortier
one
thing
was
lacking
to
ange
that
catherine
had
not
witnessed
his
oratorical
triumph
but
billet
hastened
to
impart
his
pleasure
to
his
wife
and
daughter
mother
billet
said
nothing
being
a
woman
of
narrow
mind
i
am
afraid
you
will
get
into
trouble
sighed
catherine
smiling
sadly
pshaw
playing
the
bird
of
again
let
me
tell
you
that
i
like
larks
better
than
owls
father
i
had
warning
that
you
were
looked
upon
suspiciously
who
said
so
a
friend
advice
ought
to
be
thanked
tell
me
the
friend
name
he
ought
to
be
well
informed
as
it
is
viscount
isidor
charny
what
makes
that
scented
dandy
meddle
with
such
matters
does
he
give
me
advice
on
the
way
i
should
think
do
i
suggest
how
he
should
cut
his
coat
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
only
tarring
him
with
the
same
brush
i
am
not
telling
you
this
to
vex
you
father
but
the
advice
is
given
with
good
intention
i
will
give
him
a
piece
and
you
can
transmit
it
with
my
compliments
let
him
and
his
upper
class
look
to
themselves
the
national
assembly
is
going
to
give
them
a
shaking
up
and
the
question
will
be
roughly
handled
of
the
royal
pets
and
favorites
warning
to
his
brother
george
the
count
of
charny
who
is
one
of
the
gang
and
on
very
close
terms
with
the
austrian
leech
father
you
have
more
experience
than
we
and
you
can
act
as
you
please
returned
the
girl
indeed
said
pitou
in
a
low
voice
why
does
this
charny
fop
shove
in
his
oar
anyhow
for
he
was
filled
with
arrogance
from
his
success
catherine
did
not
hear
or
pretended
not
and
the
subject
dropped
pitou
thought
the
dinner
lasted
a
long
time
as
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
go
off
with
catherine
and
show
his
finery
at
the
rustic
ball
catherine
looked
charming
she
was
a
pretty
but
fair
girl
slender
and
flexible
as
the
willows
shading
the
farm
spring
she
had
tricked
herself
out
with
the
natural
daintiness
setting
off
all
her
advantages
and
the
little
cap
she
had
made
for
herself
suited
her
wonderfully
almost
the
first
of
the
stray
gentlemen
who
condescended
to
patronize
the
popular
amusement
was
a
young
man
whom
pitou
guessed
to
be
isidor
charny
he
was
a
handsome
young
blade
of
or
so
graceful
in
every
movement
like
those
brought
up
in
aristocratic
education
from
the
cradle
besides
he
was
one
of
those
who
wear
dress
to
the
best
harmony
on
seeing
his
hands
and
feet
pitou
began
to
be
less
proud
over
nature
prodigality
towards
him
in
these
respects
he
looked
down
at
his
legs
with
the
eye
of
the
stag
in
the
fable
he
sighed
when
catherine
wished
to
know
why
he
was
so
glum
but
honest
pitou
after
being
forced
to
own
the
superiority
of
charny
as
a
beauty
had
to
do
so
as
a
dancer
dancing
was
part
of
the
training
then
lauzum
owed
his
fortune
at
court
to
his
skill
in
a
curranto
in
the
royal
quadrille
more
than
one
other
nobleman
had
won
his
way
by
the
manner
of
treading
a
measure
and
arching
the
instep
the
viscount
was
a
model
of
grace
and
perfection
lord
mercy
sighed
pitou
when
catherine
returned
to
him
i
shall
never
dare
to
dance
with
you
after
seeing
lord
charny
at
it
catherine
did
not
answer
as
she
was
too
good
to
tell
a
lie
she
stared
at
the
speaker
for
he
was
suddenly
becoming
a
man
he
could
feel
jealousy
she
danced
three
or
four
times
yet
and
after
another
round
with
isidor
charny
she
asked
to
be
taken
home
that
was
all
she
had
come
for
one
might
guess
what
ails
you
she
asked
as
her
companion
kept
quiet
why
do
you
not
speak
to
me
because
i
can
not
talk
like
viscount
charny
was
the
other
reply
what
can
i
say
after
all
the
fine
things
he
spoke
during
the
dances
you
are
unfair
ange
for
we
were
talking
about
you
if
your
guardian
does
not
turn
up
we
must
find
you
a
patron
am
i
not
good
enough
to
keep
the
farm
books
sighed
pitou
on
the
contrary
with
the
education
you
have
received
you
are
fitted
for
something
better
i
do
not
know
what
i
am
coming
to
but
i
do
not
want
to
owe
it
to
viscount
charny
why
refuse
his
protection
his
brother
the
count
is
they
say
particularly
in
favor
at
the
court
and
he
married
a
bosom
friend
of
the
queen
marie
antoinette
lord
isidor
tells
me
that
he
will
get
you
a
place
in
the
if
you
like
much
obliged
but
as
i
have
already
told
you
i
am
content
to
stay
as
i
am
if
your
father
does
not
send
me
away
why
the
devil
should
i
broke
in
a
rough
voice
which
catherine
started
to
recognize
as
her
father
not
a
word
about
lord
isidor
whispered
she
to
pitou
i
i
hardly
know
i
kind
o
feared
i
was
not
smart
enough
stammered
ange
when
you
can
count
like
one
and
read
to
beat
the
schoolmaster
who
still
believes
himself
a
wise
clerk
no
pitou
the
good
god
brings
people
to
me
and
once
they
are
under
my
rooftree
they
stick
as
long
as
he
pleases
with
this
assurance
pitou
returned
to
his
new
home
he
had
experienced
a
great
change
he
had
lost
trust
in
himself
and
so
he
slept
badly
he
recalled
gilbert
book
it
was
principally
against
the
privileged
classes
and
their
abuses
and
the
cowardice
of
those
who
submitted
to
them
pitou
fancied
he
began
to
understand
these
matters
better
and
he
made
up
his
mind
to
read
more
of
the
work
on
the
morrow
rising
early
he
went
down
with
it
into
the
yard
where
he
could
have
the
light
fall
on
the
book
through
an
open
window
with
the
additional
advantage
that
he
might
see
catherine
through
it
she
might
be
expected
down
at
any
moment
but
when
he
glanced
up
from
his
reading
at
the
intervention
of
an
opaque
body
between
him
and
the
light
he
was
amazed
at
the
disagreeable
person
who
caused
the
eclipse
this
was
a
man
of
middle
age
longer
and
thinner
than
pitou
clad
in
a
coat
as
patched
and
as
his
own
for
pitou
had
resumed
his
old
clothes
for
the
working
day
while
thrusting
his
head
forward
on
a
lank
neck
he
read
the
book
with
as
much
curiosity
as
the
other
felt
relish
though
it
was
upside
down
to
him
ange
was
greatly
astonished
a
kind
smile
adorned
the
stranger
mouth
in
which
a
few
snags
stuck
up
a
pair
crossing
another
like
fangs
the
american
edition
said
the
man
snuffling
up
his
nose
in
octavo
the
freedom
of
man
and
the
independence
of
nations
boston
pitou
opened
his
eyes
in
proportion
to
the
progress
of
the
unknown
reader
so
that
when
he
had
reached
the
end
his
eyes
were
at
the
utmost
extent
just
so
sir
said
pitou
this
is
the
treatise
of
dr
gilbert
said
the
man
in
black
yes
sir
rejoined
the
young
man
politely
he
rose
as
he
had
been
taught
that
he
must
not
sit
in
a
presence
and
to
simple
ange
everybody
was
a
superior
in
rising
something
fair
and
rosy
attracted
his
attention
at
the
window
it
was
catherine
come
down
at
last
who
was
making
cautionary
signs
to
him
i
do
not
want
to
be
inquisitive
sir
but
i
should
like
to
know
whose
book
this
is
remarked
the
stranger
pointing
at
the
book
without
touching
it
as
it
was
between
pitou
hands
pitou
was
going
to
say
it
belonged
to
billet
but
the
girl
motioned
that
he
ought
to
lay
claim
to
it
himself
so
he
majestically
responded
this
book
is
mine
the
man
in
black
had
seen
nothing
but
the
book
and
its
reader
and
heard
but
these
words
but
he
suspiciously
glanced
behind
swift
as
a
bird
catherine
had
vanished
your
book
yes
do
you
want
to
read
it
legendi
libri
or
historiae
hello
you
appear
much
above
the
condition
your
clothes
beseem
said
the
stranger
dives
vestitu
sed
ingenio
and
it
follows
that
i
take
you
into
custody
me
in
custody
gasped
pitou
at
the
summit
of
stupefaction
at
the
order
of
the
man
in
black
two
sergeants
of
the
paris
police
seemed
to
rise
up
out
of
the
ground
let
us
draw
up
a
report
said
the
man
while
one
of
the
constables
bound
pitou
hands
by
a
rope
and
took
the
book
into
his
own
possession
and
the
other
secured
the
prisoner
to
a
ring
happening
to
be
by
the
window
pitou
was
going
to
bellow
but
the
same
person
who
had
already
so
influenced
him
seemed
to
hint
he
should
submit
he
submitted
with
a
docility
enchanting
the
policemen
and
the
man
in
a
black
suit
in
particular
hence
without
any
distrust
they
walked
into
the
farmhouse
where
the
two
policemen
took
seats
at
a
table
while
the
other
we
shall
know
what
he
was
after
presently
scarcely
had
the
trio
gone
in
than
pitou
heard
the
voice
hold
up
your
hands
he
raised
them
and
his
head
as
well
and
saw
catherine
pale
and
frightened
face
in
her
hand
she
held
a
knife
pitou
rose
on
tiptoe
and
she
cut
the
rope
round
his
wrists
take
the
knife
she
said
and
cut
yourself
free
from
the
ringbolt
pitou
did
not
wait
for
twice
telling
but
found
himself
wholly
free
here
is
a
went
on
the
girl
you
have
good
legs
make
away
go
to
paris
and
warn
the
doctor
she
could
not
conclude
for
the
constables
appeared
again
as
the
coin
fell
at
pitou
feet
he
picked
it
up
quickly
indeed
the
armed
constables
stood
on
the
sill
for
an
instant
astounded
to
see
the
man
free
whom
they
had
left
bound
but
as
at
the
dog
least
stir
the
hare
bolts
at
the
first
move
of
the
police
pitou
made
a
prodigious
leap
and
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
they
uttered
a
yell
which
brought
out
the
corporal
who
held
a
little
casket
under
the
arm
he
lost
no
time
in
but
darted
after
the
escaped
one
his
men
followed
his
example
but
they
were
not
able
to
jump
the
hedge
and
ditch
like
pitou
and
were
forced
to
go
roundabout
but
when
they
got
over
they
beheld
the
youth
five
hundred
paces
off
on
the
meadow
tearing
away
directly
to
the
woods
a
quarter
of
a
league
distant
which
he
would
gain
in
a
short
time
he
turned
at
this
nick
and
perceiving
the
enemy
take
up
the
chase
though
more
for
the
name
of
the
thing
than
any
hope
of
overtaking
him
he
doubled
his
speed
and
soon
dashed
out
of
sight
in
the
thicket
he
had
the
wind
as
well
as
the
swiftness
of
the
buck
and
he
ran
for
ten
minutes
as
he
might
for
an
hour
but
judging
that
he
was
out
of
danger
by
his
instinct
he
stopped
to
breathe
listen
and
make
sure
that
he
was
quite
alone
it
is
incredible
what
a
quantity
of
incidents
have
been
crammed
into
three
days
he
mused
he
looked
alternately
at
his
coin
and
the
knife
i
must
find
time
to
change
the
gold
and
give
miss
catherine
a
penny
for
the
knife
for
fear
it
will
cut
our
friendship
never
mind
since
she
bade
me
go
to
paris
i
shall
go
on
making
out
where
he
was
he
struck
a
straight
line
over
the
heath
to
come
out
on
the
paris
highroad
chapter
why
the
police
agent
came
with
the
constables
about
six
that
morning
a
from
the
capital
accompanied
by
two
inferior
policemen
had
arrived
at
villers
cotterets
where
they
presented
themselves
to
the
police
justice
and
asked
him
to
tell
them
where
farmer
billet
dwelt
five
hundred
paces
from
the
farmhouse
the
corporal
as
the
rank
was
in
the
organization
of
the
police
of
the
era
perceived
a
peasant
working
in
the
field
of
whom
he
inquired
about
his
master
the
man
pointed
to
a
horseman
a
quarter
of
a
league
off
he
wo
be
back
till
nine
he
said
there
he
is
inspecting
the
work
he
comes
in
for
breakfast
then
if
you
want
to
please
your
master
run
and
tell
him
a
gentleman
from
town
is
waiting
to
see
him
do
you
mean
dr
gilbert
run
and
tell
him
all
the
same
no
sooner
was
he
notified
than
billet
galloped
home
but
when
he
entered
the
room
where
he
expected
to
see
his
landlord
under
the
canopy
of
the
large
fireplace
none
were
there
but
his
wife
sitting
in
the
middle
plucking
ducks
with
all
the
care
such
a
task
demands
catherine
was
up
in
her
room
preparing
finery
for
sunday
from
the
pleasure
girls
feel
in
getting
ready
for
fun
who
asked
for
me
demanded
billet
stopping
on
the
threshold
and
looking
round
me
replied
a
voice
behind
him
turning
the
yeoman
beheld
the
and
his
two
myrmidons
how
now
what
do
you
want
he
snarled
making
three
steps
backwards
next
to
nothing
dear
master
billet
replied
the
unctuous
speaker
we
have
to
make
a
search
in
your
premises
that
is
all
a
search
hey
repeated
billet
glancing
at
his
gun
on
hooks
over
the
mantelpiece
since
we
had
a
national
assembly
he
said
i
thought
citizens
were
no
longer
exposed
to
proceedings
which
smack
of
another
age
and
style
of
things
what
do
you
want
with
a
peaceable
and
loyal
man
policemen
are
alike
all
the
world
over
in
their
never
answering
questions
of
their
victims
some
bewail
them
while
clapping
on
the
iron
cuffs
searching
them
or
pinioning
they
are
the
most
dangerous
as
they
appear
to
be
the
best
the
fellow
who
descended
on
farmer
billet
was
of
the
hypocritical
school
those
who
have
a
tear
for
those
they
overhaul
but
they
never
let
their
hands
be
idle
to
dash
away
the
tear
uttering
a
sigh
this
man
waved
his
hand
to
his
acolytes
who
went
up
to
billet
he
jumped
back
and
reached
out
for
his
musket
but
his
hand
was
turned
aside
from
the
doubly
dangerous
weapon
to
him
who
made
use
of
it
and
her
whose
pair
of
slight
hands
was
strong
with
terror
and
mighty
with
entreaty
it
was
catherine
who
had
rushed
to
the
spot
in
time
to
save
her
father
from
the
crime
of
rebellion
to
justice
after
this
first
outburst
billet
made
no
further
resistance
the
police
agent
ordered
him
to
be
locked
up
in
one
of
the
ground
floor
rooms
which
he
had
noticed
to
be
barred
though
billet
who
had
the
grating
done
had
forgotten
the
precaution
catherine
was
placed
in
a
room
and
billet
was
shoved
into
the
kitchen
as
inoffensive
master
of
the
fort
the
exempt
set
to
searching
all
the
furniture
what
are
you
doing
roared
billet
who
saw
through
the
keyhole
that
his
house
was
turned
out
of
windows
looking
as
you
see
for
something
we
can
not
find
replied
the
police
officer
but
you
may
be
robbers
burglars
scoundrels
oh
you
wrong
us
master
rejoined
the
fellow
through
the
door
we
are
honest
folk
like
yourself
only
we
are
in
the
wages
of
the
king
and
we
have
to
obey
his
orders
his
majesty
orders
repeated
the
farmer
king
louis
xvi
gives
you
orders
to
rummage
my
desk
and
turn
my
things
upside
down
when
the
famine
was
so
dreadful
last
year
that
we
thought
of
eating
our
horses
when
the
hail
on
the
thirteenth
of
july
two
years
back
cut
our
wheat
to
chaff
his
majesty
never
bothered
about
us
what
has
happened
at
my
farm
at
present
for
him
to
concern
himself
never
having
seen
or
known
me
you
will
please
excuse
me
said
the
man
opening
the
door
a
little
and
warily
showing
a
issued
by
the
chief
of
police
but
as
usual
commencing
with
in
the
king
name
his
majesty
has
heard
about
you
old
fellow
though
he
may
not
personally
know
you
do
not
kick
at
the
honor
he
does
you
and
try
to
receive
properly
those
whom
he
sends
in
his
royal
name
with
a
polite
bow
and
a
friendly
wink
the
chief
policeman
slammed
the
door
and
recommenced
the
ferreting
billet
held
his
tongue
and
with
folded
arms
trod
the
room
he
felt
he
was
in
the
men
power
the
searching
went
on
silently
these
men
seemed
fallen
from
the
skies
no
one
had
seen
them
but
the
who
had
pointed
out
the
way
to
the
farmhouse
in
the
yard
the
had
not
barked
the
leader
of
the
expedition
must
be
a
celebrated
man
in
his
line
and
not
making
his
first
arrest
billet
heard
his
daughter
wailing
in
the
room
overhead
he
recalled
her
prophetic
words
for
he
had
no
doubt
that
the
investigation
was
caused
by
the
doctor
book
nine
struck
and
billet
could
count
his
hired
men
returning
for
their
morning
meal
from
the
fields
this
made
him
comprehend
that
in
case
of
conflict
he
could
have
numbers
of
not
law
on
his
side
this
made
the
blood
boil
in
his
veins
he
had
not
the
temper
to
bear
inaction
any
longer
and
grasping
the
door
he
gave
it
such
a
shaking
by
the
handle
that
with
such
another
he
would
send
the
lock
flying
the
police
opened
it
at
once
and
confronted
the
farmer
threatening
and
upright
before
the
house
turned
inside
out
but
to
make
it
short
what
are
you
looking
for
roared
the
caged
lion
tell
me
or
by
the
lord
harry
of
navarre
i
swear
i
thump
it
out
of
you
the
flocking
in
of
the
farm
lads
had
not
escaped
the
corporal
alert
eye
he
reckoned
them
and
was
convinced
that
in
case
of
a
tussel
he
could
not
crow
on
the
battlefield
with
more
honeyed
politeness
than
before
he
sneaked
up
to
the
speaker
and
said
as
he
bowed
to
the
ground
i
am
going
to
tell
you
master
billet
though
it
goes
dead
against
the
rules
and
regulations
we
are
looking
for
a
subversive
publication
and
incendiary
pamphlet
put
on
the
back
list
by
the
royal
censors
a
book
in
the
house
of
a
farmer
who
can
not
read
what
is
there
amazing
in
that
when
you
are
friend
of
the
author
and
he
sent
you
a
copy
i
am
not
the
friend
of
gilbert
but
his
humble
servant
replied
the
other
to
be
his
friend
would
be
too
great
an
honor
for
a
poor
farmer
like
me
this
unreflected
reply
in
which
billet
betrayed
himself
by
confessing
that
he
not
only
knew
the
author
which
was
natural
being
his
landlord
but
the
book
assured
victory
to
the
officer
of
the
law
this
man
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
with
his
most
benignant
air
and
smiling
as
he
tapped
billet
on
the
shoulder
so
that
he
seemed
to
cleave
his
head
in
twain
he
said
you
have
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
you
have
been
the
first
to
name
gilbert
whose
name
we
kept
back
out
of
discretion
that
so
muttered
the
farmer
look
here
i
will
not
merely
own
up
but
will
you
stop
pulling
things
about
if
i
tell
you
where
the
book
is
why
certainly
said
the
chief
making
a
sign
to
his
associates
for
the
book
is
the
object
of
the
search
only
he
added
with
a
sly
grin
do
allow
you
have
one
copy
when
you
have
a
dozen
i
swear
i
have
only
the
one
we
are
obliged
to
get
that
down
to
a
certainty
by
the
most
minute
search
master
billet
have
five
minute
farther
patience
we
are
only
poor
servants
of
justice
under
orders
from
those
above
us
and
you
will
not
oppose
honorable
men
doing
their
duty
for
there
are
such
in
all
walks
of
life
he
had
found
the
flaw
in
the
armor
he
knew
how
to
talk
billet
over
go
on
but
be
done
quickly
he
said
turning
his
back
on
them
the
man
closed
the
door
softly
and
still
more
quietly
turned
the
key
which
made
billet
snap
his
fingers
sure
that
he
could
burst
the
door
off
its
hinges
if
he
had
to
do
it
on
his
part
the
policeman
waved
his
fellows
to
the
work
all
three
in
a
trice
went
through
the
papers
books
and
linen
suddenly
at
the
bottom
of
an
open
clothespress
they
perceived
a
small
oak
casket
clamped
with
iron
the
corporal
pounced
on
it
as
a
vulture
on
its
prey
by
the
mere
view
by
his
scent
by
the
place
where
it
was
stored
he
had
divined
what
he
sought
for
he
quickly
hid
the
box
under
his
tattered
mantle
and
beckoned
to
his
bravoes
that
he
had
accomplished
the
errand
at
that
very
moment
billet
had
come
to
the
end
of
his
patience
i
tell
you
that
you
can
not
find
what
you
are
looking
for
unless
i
tell
you
he
called
out
there
is
no
need
to
hay
with
my
things
i
am
not
a
conspirator
confound
you
come
get
this
into
your
noddles
answer
or
by
all
the
blue
moons
i
will
go
to
paris
and
complain
to
the
king
to
the
assembly
and
to
the
people
at
this
time
the
king
was
still
spoken
of
before
the
people
yes
dear
master
billet
we
hear
you
and
we
are
ready
to
bow
to
your
excellent
reasons
come
let
us
know
where
the
book
is
and
as
we
are
now
convinced
that
you
have
only
the
single
copy
we
will
seize
that
and
get
away
there
it
is
in
a
nutshell
well
the
book
is
in
the
hands
of
a
lad
to
whom
i
entrusted
it
this
morning
to
carry
it
to
a
friend
said
billet
what
is
the
name
of
this
honest
lad
queried
the
man
in
black
coaxingly
ange
pitou
he
is
a
poor
orphan
whom
i
housed
from
charity
and
who
does
not
know
the
nature
of
the
book
i
thank
you
dear
master
billet
said
the
corporal
throwing
the
linen
into
the
hole
in
the
wall
and
closing
the
lid
and
where
may
this
nice
boy
be
prithee
i
fancy
i
saw
him
as
i
came
in
under
the
arbor
by
the
spanish
climbing
beans
go
and
take
the
book
away
but
do
not
hurt
him
hurt
oh
master
you
do
not
know
us
to
think
we
would
hurt
a
fly
they
advanced
in
the
indicated
direction
where
they
had
the
adventure
with
pitou
already
described
catherine
had
heard
enough
in
the
words
about
the
doctor
the
book
and
the
to
save
the
innocent
holder
of
the
treasonable
pamphlet
since
the
double
errand
of
the
police
was
fulfilled
the
commander
of
the
expedition
was
only
too
glad
of
the
excuse
to
get
far
away
so
he
bounded
on
his
men
by
his
voice
and
example
till
they
ran
him
into
the
woods
then
they
came
to
a
halt
in
the
bushes
in
the
chase
they
were
joined
by
two
more
policeman
who
had
hidden
on
the
farm
with
orders
not
to
run
up
unless
called
faith
it
is
a
good
job
the
lad
did
not
have
the
box
instead
of
the
book
said
the
organizer
of
the
attack
we
would
be
obliged
to
take
to
catch
up
with
him
hang
me
if
he
is
a
man
at
all
so
much
as
a
deer
but
you
have
the
prize
eh
master
wolfstep
said
one
of
the
subordinates
certainly
comrade
for
here
it
is
answered
the
police
agent
to
whom
the
nickname
had
been
given
for
his
sidelong
lope
or
wolfish
tread
and
its
lightness
then
we
are
entitled
to
the
promised
reward
eh
ay
and
here
you
are
said
the
captain
of
the
squad
distributing
gold
pieces
among
them
with
no
preference
for
those
who
had
actively
prosecuted
the
search
and
the
others
long
live
the
chief
called
out
the
men
there
is
no
harm
in
your
cheering
the
chief
said
wolfstep
but
it
is
not
he
who
cashes
up
this
trip
it
is
some
friend
of
his
lady
or
gentleman
who
wants
to
keep
in
the
background
i
wager
that
he
or
she
wants
that
little
box
bad
suggested
one
of
the
hirelings
rigoulet
my
friend
said
the
leader
i
have
always
certified
that
you
are
a
chap
full
of
keenness
but
while
we
wait
for
the
gift
to
win
its
reward
we
had
better
be
on
the
move
that
confounded
countryman
does
not
look
easily
cooled
down
and
when
he
perceives
the
casket
is
missing
he
may
set
his
farm
boys
on
our
track
and
they
are
poachers
capable
of
keeling
us
over
with
a
shot
as
surely
as
the
best
swiss
marksmen
in
his
majesty
forces
this
advice
was
that
of
the
majority
for
the
five
men
kept
on
along
the
forest
skirts
out
of
sight
till
they
reached
the
highroad
this
was
no
useless
precaution
for
catherine
had
no
sooner
seen
the
party
disappear
in
pursuit
of
pitou
than
full
of
confidence
in
the
last
one
agility
who
would
lead
them
a
pretty
chase
she
called
on
the
to
open
the
door
they
knew
something
unusual
was
going
on
but
not
exactly
what
they
ran
in
to
set
her
free
and
she
liberated
her
father
billet
seemed
in
a
dream
instead
of
rushing
out
of
the
room
he
walked
forth
warily
and
acted
as
if
not
liking
to
stay
in
any
one
place
and
yet
hated
to
look
on
the
furniture
and
cupboards
disturbed
by
the
posse
they
have
got
the
book
anyway
he
questioned
i
believe
they
took
that
dad
but
not
pitou
who
cut
away
if
they
are
sticking
to
him
they
will
all
be
over
at
cayelles
or
vauciennes
by
this
time
capital
poor
lad
he
owes
all
this
harrying
to
me
oh
father
do
not
bother
about
him
but
look
to
ourselves
be
easy
about
pitou
getting
out
of
his
scrape
but
what
a
state
of
disorder
look
at
this
mother
they
are
low
blackguards
said
mother
billet
they
have
not
even
respected
my
linen
press
what
tumbled
over
the
linen
said
billet
springing
towards
the
cavity
which
the
corporal
had
carefully
closed
but
into
which
opening
it
he
plunged
both
arms
deeply
it
is
not
possible
what
are
you
looking
for
father
asked
the
girl
as
her
father
looked
about
him
bewildered
look
look
if
you
can
see
it
anywhere
the
casket
that
is
what
the
villains
were
raking
for
gilbert
casket
inquired
billet
who
commonly
let
others
do
the
talking
and
work
in
critical
times
yes
that
most
precious
casket
responded
the
farmer
thrusting
his
hands
into
his
mop
of
hair
you
frighten
me
father
said
catherine
wretch
that
i
am
cried
the
man
in
rage
and
fool
never
to
suspect
that
i
never
thought
about
the
casket
oh
what
will
the
doctor
say
what
will
he
think
that
i
am
a
betrayer
a
coward
a
worthless
fellow
oh
heavens
what
was
in
it
dad
i
do
know
but
i
answered
for
it
to
the
doctor
on
my
life
and
i
ought
to
have
been
killed
defending
it
he
made
so
threatening
a
gesture
against
himself
that
the
women
recoiled
in
terror
my
horse
bring
me
my
horse
roared
the
madman
i
must
let
the
doctor
know
he
must
be
apprised
i
told
pitou
to
do
that
good
no
what
the
use
a
man
afoot
i
must
ride
to
paris
did
you
not
read
in
his
letter
that
he
was
going
there
my
horse
and
will
you
leave
us
in
the
midst
of
anguish
i
must
my
girl
i
must
he
said
kissing
catherine
convulsively
the
doctor
said
ever
you
lose
that
box
or
rather
if
it
is
stolen
from
you
come
to
warn
me
the
instant
you
perceive
the
loss
billet
wherever
i
am
let
nothing
stop
you
not
even
the
life
of
man
lord
what
can
be
in
it
i
do
know
a
bit
but
i
do
know
that
it
was
placed
in
my
keeping
and
that
i
have
let
it
be
snatched
away
but
here
is
my
nag
i
shall
learn
where
the
father
is
by
his
son
at
the
college
kissing
his
wife
and
his
daughter
for
the
last
time
the
farmer
bestrode
his
steed
and
set
off
towards
the
city
at
full
gallop
chapter
vi
on
the
road
pitou
was
spurred
by
the
two
most
powerful
emotions
in
the
world
love
and
fear
panic
bade
him
take
care
of
himself
as
he
would
be
arrested
and
perhaps
flogged
love
in
catherine
voice
had
said
be
off
to
paris
these
two
stimulants
led
him
to
fly
rather
than
run
heaven
is
infallible
as
well
as
mighty
how
useful
were
the
long
legs
of
pitou
so
ungraceful
at
a
ball
in
streaking
it
over
the
country
as
well
as
the
knotty
knees
although
his
heart
expanded
by
terror
beat
three
to
a
second
my
lord
charny
with
his
pretty
feet
and
little
knees
and
symmetrically
placed
calves
could
not
have
dashed
along
at
this
gait
he
had
gone
four
leagues
and
a
half
in
an
hour
as
much
as
is
required
of
a
good
horse
at
the
trot
he
looked
behind
nothing
on
the
road
he
looked
forward
only
a
couple
of
women
encouraged
he
threw
himself
on
the
turf
by
the
roadside
and
reposed
the
sweet
smell
of
the
lucerne
and
marjoram
did
not
make
him
forget
mistress
billet
bacon
and
the
of
bread
which
catherine
sliced
off
for
him
at
every
meal
all
france
lacked
bread
half
as
good
as
that
so
dear
that
it
originated
the
oft
repeated
saying
of
duchess
polignac
that
the
poor
hungry
people
ought
to
eat
cake
pitou
said
that
catherine
was
the
most
generous
creature
in
creation
and
the
billet
farm
the
most
luxurious
palace
he
turned
a
dying
eye
like
the
israelites
crossing
the
jordan
towards
the
east
where
the
billet
fleshpots
smoked
sighing
but
starting
off
anew
he
went
at
a
for
a
couple
of
hours
which
brought
him
towards
dammartin
suddenly
his
expert
ear
reliable
as
a
sioux
indian
caught
the
ring
of
a
horseshoe
on
the
road
he
had
hardly
concluded
that
the
animal
was
coming
at
the
gallop
than
he
saw
it
appear
on
a
hilltop
four
hundred
paces
off
fear
which
had
for
a
space
abandoned
pitou
seized
him
afresh
and
restored
him
the
use
of
those
long
if
unshapely
legs
with
which
he
had
made
such
marvellous
good
time
a
couple
of
hours
previously
without
reflecting
looking
behind
or
trying
to
hide
his
fright
ange
cleared
the
ditch
on
one
side
and
darted
through
the
woods
to
ermenonville
he
did
not
know
the
place
but
he
spied
some
tall
trees
and
reasoned
that
if
they
were
on
the
skirts
of
a
forest
he
was
saved
this
time
he
had
to
beat
a
horse
pitou
feet
had
become
wings
he
went
all
the
faster
as
on
glancing
over
his
shoulder
he
saw
the
horseman
jump
the
hedge
and
ditch
from
the
highway
he
had
no
more
doubts
that
the
rider
was
after
him
so
that
he
not
only
doubled
his
pace
but
he
dreaded
to
lose
anything
by
looking
behind
but
the
animal
superior
to
the
biped
in
running
gained
on
him
and
pitou
heard
the
rider
plainly
calling
him
by
name
nearly
overtaken
still
he
struggled
till
the
cut
of
a
whip
crossed
his
legs
and
a
voice
thundered
blame
you
you
idiot
have
you
made
a
vow
to
founder
younker
the
horse
name
put
an
end
to
the
fugitive
irresolution
oh
i
hear
master
billet
he
groaned
as
he
rolled
over
on
his
back
exhaustion
and
the
lash
having
thrown
him
on
the
grass
assured
of
the
identity
he
sat
up
while
the
farmer
reined
in
younker
streaming
with
white
froth
oh
dear
master
said
pitou
how

i
got
to
the
end
of
the

but
since

overtaken

the
gold

it

get
back
a
thousand
devils

the
yeoman
we
have
a
lot
to
do
at
the
farm
i
do
think
where
are
the
sleuth
hounds
repeated
pitou
not
understanding
the
nickname
for
what
we
call
detective
police
officer
though
it
had
already
entered
into
the
language
those
sneaks
in
black
continued
billet
if
you
can
understand
that
better
oh
you
bet
that
i
did
not
amuse
myself
by
waiting
till
they
came
up
bravo
dropped
them
eh
flatter
myself
i
did
then
if
certain
what
did
you
keep
on
running
for
i
thought
you
were
their
captain
who
had
taken
to
horse
to
have
me
come
come
you
are
not
such
a
dunderhead
as
i
thought
as
the
road
is
clear
make
an
effort
get
up
behind
me
on
the
crupper
and
let
us
hurry
into
dammartin
i
will
change
horses
at
neighbor
lefranc
for
younker

done
up
so
we
can
push
ahead
for
paris
but
i
do
not
see
what
use
i
shall
be
there
remonstrated
pitou
but
i
think
the
other
way
you
can
serve
me
there
for
you
have
big
fists
and
i
hold
it
for
a
fact
that
they
are
going
to
fall
to
hitting
out
at
one
another
in
the
city
far
from
charmed
by
this
prospect
the
lad
was
wavering
when
billet
caught
hold
of
him
as
of
a
sack
of
flour
and
slung
him
across
the
horse
regaining
the
road
by
dint
of
spur
cudgel
and
heel
younker
was
sent
along
at
so
fair
a
gait
that
they
were
in
dammartin
in
less
than
half
an
hour
billet
rode
in
by
a
lane
not
the
main
road
to
father
lefranc
farm
where
he
left
his
man
and
horse
in
the
yard
to
run
direct
into
the
kitchen
where
the
master
going
out
was
buttoning
up
his
leggings
quick
quick
old
mate
your
best
horse
he
hailed
him
before
he
recovered
from
his
astonishment
that
maggie
the
good
beast
is
just
harnessed
i
was
going
out
on
her
she
do
only
i
give
fair
warning
that
i
shall
break
her
down
most
likely
what
for
i
should
like
to
know
because
i
must
be
in
paris
this
evening
said
the
farmer
making
the
masonic
sign
of
pressing
danger
ride
her
to
death
then
answered
lefranc
but
give
me
younker
a
bargain
have
a
glass
of
wine
two
i
have
an
honest
lad
with
me
who
is
tired
with
traveling
this
far
give
him
some
refreshment
in
ten
minutes
the
gossips
had
put
away
a
bottle
and
pitou
had
swallowed
a
loaf
and
a
hunk
of
bacon
nearly
all
fat
while
he
was
eating
the
stableman
a
good
sort
of
a
soul
rubbed
him
down
with
a
wisp
of
hay
as
if
he
were
a
favorite
horse
thus
feasted
and
massaged
pitou
swallowed
a
glass
of
wine
from
a
third
bottle
emptied
with
so
much
velocity
that
the
lad
was
lucky
to
get
his
share
billet
got
upon
maggie
and
pitou
forked
himself
on
though
stiff
as
a
pair
of
compasses
the
good
beast
tickled
by
the
spur
trotted
bravely
under
the
double
load
towards
town
without
ceasing
to
flick
off
the
flies
with
her
robust
tail
the
strong
hairs
lashing
the
dust
off
pitou
back
and
stinging
his
thin
calves
from
which
his
stockings
had
run
down
chapter
vii
the
first
blood
night
was
thickening
as
the
two
travelers
reached
la
villette
a
suburb
of
paris
a
great
flame
rose
before
them
billet
pointed
out
the
ruddy
glare
they
are
troops
camping
out
said
pitou
ca
you
see
that
and
they
have
lighted
campfires
here
are
some
so
that
there
may
naturally
be
more
over
yonder
indeed
on
attentively
looking
on
the
right
father
billet
saw
black
detachments
marching
noiselessly
in
the
shadow
of
denis
plain
horse
and
foot
their
weapons
glimmered
in
the
pale
starry
light
accustomed
to
see
in
the
dark
from
his
night
roaming
in
the
woods
pitou
pointed
out
to
his
master
cannon
mired
to
the
hubs
in
the
swampy
fields
ho
ho
muttered
billet
something
new
is
going
on
here
look
at
the
sparks
yonder
make
haste
my
lad
yes
it
is
a
house
see
the
sparks
fly
added
the
younger
man
maggie
stopped
the
rider
jumped
off
upon
the
pavement
and
going
up
to
a
group
of
soldiers
in
blue
and
yellow
uniforms
bivouacking
under
the
roadside
trees
asked
comrades
can
you
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
in
paris
the
soldiers
merely
replied
with
some
german
oaths
what
the
deuce
do
they
say
queried
billet
of
his
brother
peasant
all
i
can
tell
is
that
it
is
not
latin
replied
the
youth
trembling
greatly
i
was
a
fool
to
apply
to
the
imperial
austrian
grenadiers
muttered
billet
in
his
curiosity
still
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
road
bass
on
mit
your
vay
said
an
officer
stepping
up
und
bass
bretty
tam
queeck
doo
excuse
me
captain
said
the
farmer
but
i
want
to
go
into
paris
vat
next
as
i
see
you
are
between
me
and
the
turnpike
bars
i
feared
i
would
not
be
let
go
by
yah
you
gan
by
go
remounting
billet
indeed
got
on
but
it
was
only
to
run
in
among
the
bercheny
hussars
swarming
in
la
villette
this
time
as
they
were
his
own
countrymen
he
got
along
better
please
what
is
the
news
from
paris
he
asked
why
it
your
crazy
parisians
who
want
their
necker
and
fire
their
guns
off
at
us
as
if
we
had
anything
to
do
with
the
matter
so
replied
a
hussar
what
necker
have
they
lost
him
questioned
billet
certainly
the
king
has
turned
him
out
of
office
that
great
man
turned
out
said
the
farmer
with
the
stupor
of
a
priest
who
hears
of
a
sacrilege
more
than
that
he
is
on
the
way
to
brussels
at
present
then
it
is
a
joke
we
shall
hear
some
laughing
over
cried
billet
in
a
terrible
voice
without
thinking
of
the
danger
he
ran
in
preaching
insurrection
amid
twelve
or
fifteen
thousand
royalist
sabres
remounting
maggie
he
drove
her
with
cruel
digs
of
the
heel
up
to
the
bars
as
he
advanced
he
saw
the
fire
more
plainly
a
long
column
rose
from
the
spot
to
the
sky
it
was
the
barrier
that
was
burning
a
howling
and
furious
mob
with
women
intermixed
yelling
and
capering
as
usual
more
excitedly
than
the
men
fed
the
flames
with
pieces
of
the
bars
the
clerk
office
and
the
officers
property
on
the
road
hungarian
and
german
regiments
looked
on
at
the
devastation
with
their
muskets
grounded
without
blinking
billet
did
not
let
the
rampart
of
flame
stop
him
but
urged
maggie
through
smoke
and
fire
she
bravely
burst
through
the
incandescent
barrier
but
on
the
other
side
was
a
compact
crowd
stretching
from
the
outer
town
to
the
heart
of
the
city
some
singing
some
shouting
to
arms
billet
looked
what
he
was
a
good
farmer
coming
to
town
on
his
business
perhaps
he
roared
make
way
there
too
roughly
but
pitou
tempered
it
with
so
polite
a
make
way
if
you
please
that
one
appeal
corrected
the
other
nobody
had
any
interest
in
staying
billet
in
attending
to
his
business
and
they
let
him
go
through
maggie
had
recovered
her
strength
from
the
fire
having
singed
her
hide
and
all
this
unusual
clamor
worried
her
billet
was
obliged
to
hold
her
in
now
in
the
fear
of
crushing
the
idlers
classed
before
the
town
gate
and
the
others
who
were
as
curiously
running
from
the
gates
to
the
bars
somehow
or
other
they
pushed
on
till
they
reached
the
boulevard
where
they
were
forced
to
stop
a
procession
was
marching
from
the
bastile
to
the
royal
furniture
stores
the
two
stone
knots
binding
the
enclosure
of
paris
to
its
girth
this
broad
column
followed
a
funeral
barrow
on
which
were
placed
two
busts
one
covered
with
crape
the
other
with
flowers
the
one
in
mourning
was
necker
the
prime
minister
and
eminently
the
treasurer
dismissed
but
not
disgraced
the
bust
was
the
duke
of
orleans
who
had
openly
taken
the
swiss
financier
part
billet
asking
learned
that
this
was
popular
homage
to
the
banker
and
his
defender
the
farmer
was
born
in
a
country
where
the
orleans
family
had
been
venerated
for
a
century
and
more
he
belonged
to
the
philosophical
sect
and
consequently
regarded
necker
not
only
as
a
great
minister
but
an
apostle
of
humanity
there
was
ample
to
fire
him
he
jumped
off
his
horse
without
clearly
knowing
what
he
was
about
and
mingled
with
the
throng
yelling
long
live
the
duke
of
orleans
necker
forever
once
a
man
mixes
with
a
mob
his
individual
liberty
disappears
he
was
the
more
easily
carried
on
as
he
was
at
the
head
of
the
party
as
they
kept
up
the
shouting
long
live
necker
no
more
foreign
troops
down
with
the
outlandish
cutthroats
he
added
his
lusty
voice
to
the
others
any
superiority
is
always
appreciated
by
the
masses
the
shrill
weak
voice
of
the
parisian
spoilt
by
wine
bibbing
or
want
of
proper
food
was
nowhere
beside
the
countryman
fresh
full
and
sonorous
roar
so
that
without
too
much
jostling
shoving
and
knocking
about
billet
finally
reached
the
litter
in
another
ten
minutes
one
of
the
bearers
whose
enthusiasm
had
been
too
great
for
his
strength
gave
up
his
place
to
him
billet
you
will
observe
had
got
on
only
the
propagator
of
gilbert
doctrines
a
day
before
he
was
now
one
of
the
instruments
in
the
triumph
of
necker
and
the
duke
of
orleans
but
he
had
hardly
arrived
at
his
post
than
he
thought
of
pitou
and
the
borrowed
horse
what
had
become
of
them
while
nearing
the
litter
billet
looked
and
through
the
flare
of
the
torches
accompanying
the
and
by
the
lamps
illumining
all
the
house
windows
he
beheld
a
kind
of
walking
platform
formed
of
half
a
dozen
men
shouting
and
waving
their
arms
in
the
midst
it
was
easy
to
discern
pitou
and
his
long
arms
he
did
what
he
could
to
defend
maggie
but
spite
of
all
the
horse
was
stormed
and
was
carrying
all
who
could
clamber
on
her
back
and
hang
on
to
the
harness
and
her
tail
in
the
enlarging
darkness
she
resembled
an
elephant
loaded
with
hunters
going
for
the
tiger
her
vast
neck
had
three
or
four
fellows
established
on
it
howling
three
cheers
for
orleans
and
necker
down
with
the
foreigners
to
which
pitou
answered
all
right
but
you
will
smother
maggie
among
ye
the
intoxication
was
general
for
an
instant
billet
thought
of
carrying
help
to
his
friend
and
horse
but
he
reflected
that
he
would
probably
lose
the
honor
of
bearing
the
litter
forever
if
he
gave
it
up
he
bethought
him
also
of
the
bargain
made
with
lefranc
about
swapping
the
horses
and
anyhow
if
the
worst
happened
he
was
rich
enough
to
sacrifice
the
price
of
a
horse
on
the
altar
of
his
country
meanwhile
the
procession
made
way
turning
to
the
left
it
went
down
montmarte
street
to
victoires
place
reaching
the
palais
royale
a
great
throng
prevented
its
passing
on
a
number
of
men
with
green
leaves
stuck
in
their
hats
who
were
halloaing
to
arms
were
these
friends
or
foes
why
green
cockades
green
being
the
color
of
count
artois
the
king
youngest
brother
after
a
brief
parley
all
was
explained
on
hearing
of
necker
removal
from
office
a
young
man
had
rushed
out
of
the
foy
coffeehouse
jumped
on
a
table
in
the
palais
royale
gardens
and
flourishing
a
pistol
shouted
to
arms
all
the
loungers
in
the
public
strolling
grounds
took
up
the
call
all
the
foreign
regiments
in
the
french
army
were
gathered
round
the
capital
it
looked
like
an
austrian
invasion
as
the
regimental
names
grated
on
french
ears
their
utterance
explained
the
fear
in
the
masses
the
young
man
named
them
and
said
that
the
swiss
troops
camped
in
the
champs
elysées
with
four
field
pieces
were
going
to
march
into
the
city
that
night
with
prince
lambesq
dragoons
to
clear
the
way
he
proposed
that
the
town
defender
should
wear
an
emblem
different
from
theirs
and
plucking
a
leaf
stuck
it
in
his
hat
all
the
beholders
instantly
imitated
him
so
that
the
three
thousand
persons
stripped
the
palais
royale
trees
in
a
twinkling
in
the
morning
the
young
man
name
was
unknown
but
it
was
celebrated
that
night
it
was
camille
desmoulins
men
recognized
one
another
in
the
crowd
shook
hands
in
token
of
brotherhood
and
all
joined
in
with
the
procession
at
richelieu
street
corner
billet
looked
back
and
saw
the
disappearance
of
maggie
the
increase
of
curiosity
during
the
halt
was
such
that
more
had
been
added
to
the
poor
animal
burden
and
she
had
sunk
under
the
surcharge
the
farmer
sighed
then
collecting
his
powers
he
called
out
to
pitou
three
times
like
the
ancient
romans
at
the
funeral
of
their
king
he
fancied
a
voice
made
reply
out
of
the
bowels
of
the
earth
but
it
was
drowned
in
the
confused
uproar
ascending
to
heaven
partly
cheers
and
partly
threatening
still
the
train
proceeded
all
the
stores
were
closed
but
all
windows
were
open
and
thence
fell
encouragement
on
the
marchers
farther
to
frenzy
them
at
vendome
square
an
unforeseen
obstacle
checked
the
march
like
the
logs
rolling
in
a
freshet
which
strike
up
against
the
piles
of
a
bridge
and
rebound
the
leaders
recoiled
from
a
detachment
of
a
royal
german
regiment
these
were
dragoons
who
seeing
the
mob
surge
into
the
square
from
honore
street
relaxed
the
reins
of
their
chargers
impatient
at
having
been
curbed
since
five
and
they
dashed
on
the
people
at
full
speed
the
bearers
of
the
litter
received
the
first
shock
and
were
knocked
down
when
it
was
overthrown
a
savoyard
before
billet
was
the
first
to
rise
he
picked
up
the
effigy
of
prince
orleans
and
fixing
it
on
the
top
of
his
walking
stick
waved
it
above
his
head
crying
long
live
the
duke
of
orleans
whom
he
had
never
seen
and
hurrah
for
necker
whom
he
did
not
know
from
adam
billet
was
going
to
do
the
same
with
necker
bust
but
he
was
forestalled
a
young
dandy
in
elegant
attire
had
been
watching
it
the
easier
for
him
than
billet
as
he
was
not
burdened
with
the
barrow
poles
and
he
sprang
for
it
the
moment
it
reached
the
ground
up
it
went
on
the
point
of
a
pike
and
set
close
to
the
other
served
as
for
the
scattered
processionists
suddenly
a
flash
lit
up
the
square
at
the
same
instant
bang
went
the
report
and
the
bullets
whistled
something
heavy
struck
billet
in
the
forehead
so
that
he
fell
believing
that
he
was
killed
but
as
he
did
not
lose
his
senses
and
felt
no
hurt
except
pain
in
the
head
he
understood
that
at
the
worst
he
was
merely
wounded
he
slapped
his
hand
to
his
brow
and
perceived
it
was
but
a
bump
there
though
his
palm
was
smeared
with
blood
the
stripling
in
front
of
the
farmer
had
been
shot
in
the
breast
it
was
he
who
was
slain
and
his
blood
that
had
splashed
billet
the
shock
the
latter
felt
was
from
necker
bust
falling
from
want
of
a
holder
on
the
farmer
head
he
uttered
a
shout
half
rage
half
horror
he
sprang
aloof
from
the
youth
writhing
in
the
those
around
fell
back
in
like
manner
and
the
yell
which
he
gave
repeated
by
the
multitude
was
prolonged
in
funeral
echoes
to
the
last
groups
in
honore
street
this
shout
was
a
new
proof
of
revolt
a
second
volley
was
heard
and
deep
gaps
in
the
throng
showed
where
the
projectiles
had
passed
what
indignation
inspired
in
billet
and
what
he
did
in
the
gush
of
enthusiasm
was
to
pick
up
the
bust
wave
it
over
his
head
and
cheer
with
his
fine
manly
voice
in
protest
at
the
risk
of
being
killed
like
the
patriotic
fop
dead
at
his
feet
but
instantly
a
large
and
vigorous
hand
came
down
on
the
shoulder
and
so
pressed
him
that
he
had
to
bow
to
the
weight
he
tried
to
wrest
himself
from
the
grasp
but
another
fist
quite
as
strong
and
heavy
fell
on
his
other
shoulder
he
turned
growling
to
learn
what
kind
of
antagonist
was
this
pitou
he
cried
i
am
your
man
but
stop
a
little
and
you
will
see
why
redoubling
his
efforts
he
brought
the
resisting
man
to
his
knees
and
flat
on
his
face
scarcely
was
this
done
than
a
second
volley
thundered
the
savoyard
bearing
the
orleans
bust
came
down
in
his
turn
hit
by
a
ball
in
the
thigh
then
they
heard
iron
on
the
paving
stones
the
dragoons
charged
for
the
second
time
one
horse
furious
and
shaking
his
mane
like
the
steed
in
the
apocalypse
jumped
over
the
unhappy
savoyard
who
felt
the
chill
of
a
lance
piercing
his
chest
as
he
fell
on
billet
and
pitou
the
whirlwind
rushed
to
the
end
of
the
street
where
it
engulfed
itself
in
terror
and
death
nothing
but
corpses
strewed
the
ground
all
fled
by
the
adjacent
streets
the
windows
banged
to
a
lugubrious
silence
succeeded
the
cheers
and
the
roars
of
rage
for
an
instant
billet
waited
held
by
the
prudent
peasant
then
feeling
that
the
danger
went
farther
away
he
rose
on
one
knee
while
the
other
like
the
hare
in
her
form
pricked
up
his
ear
only
without
raising
his
head
i
believe
you
are
right
master
said
the
young
man
we
have
arrived
while
the
soup
is
hot
lend
me
a
hand
to
help
you
out
of
this
no
the
young
exquisite
is
dead
but
the
savoyard
is
only
in
a
swoon
i
reckon
help
me
get
him
on
my
back
we
can
not
leave
so
plucky
a
fellow
here
to
be
butchered
by
these
cursed
troopers
billet
used
language
going
straight
to
pitou
heart
he
had
no
answer
but
to
obey
he
took
up
the
warm
and
bleeding
body
and
loaded
it
like
a
bag
of
meal
on
to
the
robust
farmer
back
seeing
honore
street
looked
clear
and
deserted
he
took
that
road
to
the
palais
royale
with
his
man
chapter
viii
pitou
discovers
he
is
brave
the
street
appeared
void
and
lonesome
to
billet
and
his
friend
because
the
cavalry
in
chase
of
the
hyers
had
gone
through
the
market
and
scattered
after
them
in
the
side
streets
but
as
the
pair
got
nearer
the
palais
royale
calling
out
in
a
hoarse
voice
by
instinct
revenge
men
began
to
appear
in
doorways
up
cellars
out
of
alleys
from
the
carriage
gateways
mute
and
frightened
at
the
first
but
when
assured
that
the
had
gone
on
forming
the
procession
anew
they
repeated
in
a
low
tone
but
soon
in
a
loud
one
revenge
pitou
marched
behind
the
farmer
carrying
the
savoyard
cap
thus
the
mournful
and
ghastly
cortege
arrived
on
palais
royale
place
where
a
concourse
drunk
with
wrath
were
holding
council
and
soliciting
the
french
troops
to
help
them
against
the
foreign
ones
what
are
these
men
in
uniform
inquired
billet
in
front
of
a
company
standing
under
arms
to
bar
the
road
from
the
palace
main
doors
to
chartres
street
the
french
guards
answered
several
voices
oh
said
the
countryman
going
nearer
and
showing
the
body
of
the
savoyard
which
was
lifeless
now
are
you
frenchmen
and
let
us
be
murdered
by
foreigners
the
guardsmen
shrank
back
a
step
involuntarily
dead
uttered
several
dead
murdered
along
with
lots
more
by
the
royal
german
dragoons
did
you
not
hear
the
charging
cry
the
shots
the
and
the
shrieks
of
the
defenseless
yes
shouted
two
or
three
hundred
voices
the
people
were
cut
down
on
vendome
square
and
so
are
you
the
people
shouted
billet
to
the
soldiers
it
is
cowardice
of
you
to
let
your
brothers
be
hacked
to
pieces
cowardice
muttered
some
of
the
men
in
the
ranks
threateningly
yes
i
said
cowardice
and
i
say
it
again
look
here
billet
went
on
taking
three
steps
towards
the
point
where
the
protest
had
risen
perhaps
you
will
shoot
me
down
to
prove
that
you
are
not
cowards
that
is
all
very
good
said
a
soldier
you
are
a
honest
blunt
fellow
my
friend
but
you
are
citizens
and
you
do
not
understand
that
soldiers
are
bound
by
orders
do
you
mean
to
say
said
billet
that
if
you
receive
orders
to
fire
on
us
unarmed
men
that
you
the
successors
of
the
guards
who
at
fontenoy
bade
the
english
shoot
first
would
do
that
i
wager
i
would
not
said
the
soldier
nor
i
nor
i
echoed
several
of
his
comrades
then
stop
the
others
firing
on
us
continued
billet
to
let
the
royal
germans
cut
our
throats
is
tantamount
to
doing
it
yourselves
the
dragoons
here
come
the
dragoons
yelled
many
at
the
same
time
as
the
gathering
began
to
retire
over
the
square
to
get
away
up
richelieu
street
at
a
distance
but
approaching
they
heard
the
clatter
of
heavy
cavalry
to
arms
to
arms
cried
the
runaways
plague
on
you
said
billet
throwing
down
the
dead
savoyard
lend
us
your
guns
if
you
will
not
use
them
hold
on
till
you
see
whether
we
wo
use
them
said
the
soldier
whom
billet
had
addressed
as
he
snatched
back
the
musket
which
the
farmer
had
torn
from
his
grip
bite
your
cartridges
boys
and
make
the
austrians
bite
the
dust
if
they
interfere
with
these
good
fellows
ay
they
shall
see
said
the
soldiers
carrying
their
hands
from
the
to
their
mouths
thunder
muttered
billet
stamping
his
foot
why
did
i
not
bring
my
old
along
but
one
of
these
pesky
austrians
may
be
laid
out
and
i
can
get
his
carbine
in
the
meantime
said
a
voice
taking
this
gun
it
is
ready
loaded
a
stranger
slipped
a
handsome
into
billet
hands
at
this
very
instant
the
dragoons
rushed
into
the
square
upsetting
everybody
they
ran
against
the
officer
commanding
the
french
guards
came
out
three
steps
to
the
front
halloa
you
gentlemen
of
the
heavy
dragoons
he
called
out
halt
please
whether
the
cavalry
did
not
hear
him
or
did
not
want
to
hear
him
or
again
were
carried
on
by
the
impetus
of
a
charge
too
violent
to
check
the
germans
wheeled
by
a
to
the
right
and
trampled
down
an
old
man
and
a
woman
who
disappeared
under
the
hoofs
fire
roared
billet
why
do
you
fire
he
was
near
the
officer
and
the
order
might
have
been
taken
as
coming
from
him
anyway
the
french
guards
carried
their
muskets
to
the
shoulder
and
delivered
a
volley
which
stopped
the
dragoons
short
here
gentlemen
of
the
guards
said
a
german
officer
coming
before
the
squadron
thrown
into
disorder
do
you
know
you
are
firing
on
us
yes
by
heaven
we
know
it
and
you
shall
know
it
too
so
billet
retorted
taking
aim
at
the
speaker
and
dropping
him
with
the
shot
thereupon
the
reserve
rank
of
the
guards
made
a
discharge
and
the
germans
seeing
that
they
had
trained
soldiery
to
deal
with
and
not
citizens
who
broke
and
fled
at
the
first
shot
pulled
round
and
made
off
for
vendome
square
in
the
midst
of
a
formidable
outburst
of
hoots
and
cheers
of
triumph
so
that
some
horses
broke
loose
and
smashed
their
heads
against
the
store
shutters
hurrah
for
the
french
guards
shouted
the
multitude
hurrah
for
the
guards
of
the
country
said
billet
thank
you
said
a
soldier
we
are
given
the
right
name
and
christened
with
fire
i
have
been
under
fire
too
said
pitou
and
it
is
not
as
dreadful
as
i
imagined
it
now
who
owns
this
gun
queried
billet
examining
the
rifle
which
was
a
costly
one
my
master
answered
the
man
who
had
lent
him
it
and
who
wore
the
orleans
livery
he
thinks
you
use
it
too
handsomely
to
have
to
return
it
where
is
your
master
demanded
the
farmer
the
servant
pointed
to
a
blind
behind
which
the
prince
was
watching
what
happened
is
he
with
us
then
with
heart
and
soul
for
the
people
replied
the
domestic
in
that
case
three
cheers
again
for
the
duke
of
orleans
said
the
farmer
friends
the
duke
of
orleans
is
on
our
side
three
cheers
for
the
duke
he
pointed
upwards
and
the
prince
showed
himself
for
an
instant
while
he
bowed
three
times
to
the
shouting
short
as
was
the
appearance
it
lifted
enthusiasm
to
the
utmost
break
open
the
gunsmith
shouted
a
voice
in
the
turbulence
let
us
go
to
the
invalid
soldiers
hospital
added
some
old
veterans
general
sombreuil
has
twenty
thousand
muskets
there
and
to
the
city
hall
exclaimed
others
flesselles
provost
of
the
traders
has
the
keys
for
the
town
guards
armory
and
he
must
give
them
up
to
the
hall
bellowed
a
fraction
of
the
assemblage
all
flowed
away
in
one
or
the
other
of
the
three
directions
called
out
during
this
time
the
dragoons
had
rallied
around
baron
bezenval
and
prince
lambesq
on
louis
xv
square
billet
and
pitou
were
unaware
of
this
as
they
followed
none
of
the
parties
and
were
left
pretty
well
alone
on
palais
royale
square
well
where
are
we
off
to
dear
master
billet
inquired
ange
pitou
i
should
like
to
follow
the
crowd
replied
the
other
not
to
the
gunmakers
as
i
have
a
gun
but
to
the
city
hall
or
the
military
asylum
still
as
we
came
to
town
not
to
fight
but
to
learn
doctor
gilbert
address
i
think
we
ought
to
go
to
college
where
his
son
is
when
i
shall
have
got
through
with
the
doctor
we
can
jump
back
into
the
his
eyes
flashed
lightnings
this
course
seems
logical
to
me
observed
the
young
peasant
so
take
some
weapon
gun
or
sword
from
those
beer
drinkers
lying
there
said
the
farmer
pointing
to
dragoons
on
the
pave
and
let
us
go
to
the
college
but
these
weapons
are
not
mine
but
the
king
objected
pitou
they
are
the
people
corrected
billet
whereupon
the
other
who
knew
the
speaker
was
incapable
of
wronging
a
man
to
the
extent
of
a
went
up
to
the
nearest
corpse
with
multiplied
caution
and
making
sure
he
was
lifeless
he
took
his
musket
and
sabre
he
wanted
to
take
his
hamlet
but
had
his
doubts
about
the
defensive
armor
being
confisticatable
like
the
offensive
arms
while
deliberating
he
listened
towards
vendome
square
it
seems
to
me
that
the
royal
germans
are
coming
back
again
he
said
indeed
a
troop
of
horse
was
heard
coming
at
the
walking
gait
quick
quick
they
are
returning
said
pitou
billet
looked
around
to
see
what
means
of
resistance
were
offered
but
the
place
was
almost
deserted
let
us
be
off
said
he
he
went
down
chartres
street
followed
by
pitou
who
dragged
the
sabre
after
him
by
the
not
knowing
how
it
ought
to
be
hooked
up
till
billet
showed
him
you
looked
like
a
he
said
on
louis
xv
square
they
met
the
column
started
off
to
go
over
the
river
to
the
invalides
but
stopped
short
the
bridges
and
the
champs
elysées
were
blocked
try
the
tuileries
garden
bridge
suggested
billet
it
was
quite
a
simple
proposition
the
mob
accepted
it
and
followed
billet
but
swords
shining
half
way
to
the
gardens
indicated
that
cavalry
intercepted
the
march
to
that
bridge
these
confounded
dragoons
are
everywhere
grumbled
the
farmer
i
believe
we
are
caught
said
his
friend
nonsense
five
or
six
thousand
men
are
to
be
caught
and
we
are
that
strong
the
dragoons
came
forward
slowly
but
it
was
an
advance
the
royale
street
is
left
us
said
billet
come
this
way
ange
but
a
line
of
soldiers
shut
this
street
up
it
looks
as
though
you
were
right
said
the
countryman
alas
sighed
ange
who
had
followed
him
like
his
shadow
all
his
regret
at
not
being
wrong
was
shown
in
the
single
word
by
the
tone
it
was
spoken
in
by
its
clamor
and
motion
the
mob
showed
that
it
was
no
less
sensible
than
he
about
the
quandary
all
were
in
indeed
by
a
skillful
manoeuvre
prince
lambesq
had
encircled
the
rioters
in
a
bow
of
iron
the
cord
being
represented
by
the
tuileries
hard
to
climb
over
and
the
drawbridge
railing
almost
impossible
to
force
billet
judged
that
the
position
was
bad
still
being
a
cool
fellow
full
of
resources
when
the
emergency
rose
he
looked
round
him
seeing
a
pile
of
lumber
by
the
riverside
he
said
i
have
a
notion
pitou
come
along
billet
went
up
to
a
beam
and
took
up
one
end
making
a
nod
to
his
followers
as
much
as
to
say
take
your
end
of
it
pitou
was
bent
on
helping
his
leader
without
questioning
he
had
such
trust
in
him
that
he
would
have
gone
down
into
sheol
without
grumbling
on
the
length
of
the
road
or
how
the
heat
increased
as
they
got
on
the
pair
returned
to
the
waterside
walk
carrying
a
burden
which
half
a
dozen
ordinary
men
would
have
sunk
under
strength
is
always
an
object
of
admiration
to
the
crowd
although
very
closely
packed
way
was
made
for
the
peasants
catching
an
idea
of
the
work
ahead
some
men
walked
before
the
calling
out
clear
the
way
there
i
say
father
billet
are
we
to
make
a
long
job
of
this
asked
pitou
when
they
had
gone
some
thirty
strides
up
to
that
gateway
i
can
go
it
replied
the
young
man
laconically
as
he
saw
it
was
about
as
much
farther
and
the
crowd
having
an
inkling
of
the
plan
cheered
them
besides
some
helped
to
carry
and
the
beam
went
on
much
more
rapidly
in
five
minutes
they
stood
before
the
gates
now
then
heave
and
all
together
said
billet
i
understand
said
pitou
this
is
what
the
ancient
romans
called
a
the
piece
of
timber
set
going
was
banged
with
a
terrible
blow
against
the
gate
lock
the
military
on
guard
within
the
gardens
ran
to
check
this
inroad
but
at
the
third
swing
the
gates
yielded
and
the
multitude
flowed
into
the
dark
gap
by
the
movement
prince
lambesq
perceived
that
the
netted
rioters
had
found
an
outlet
rage
mastered
him
to
see
his
prisoners
escape
he
started
his
horse
forward
to
learn
what
was
the
matter
when
his
men
thinking
he
was
leading
a
charge
followed
him
closely
the
horses
were
heated
with
their
recent
work
and
could
not
be
restrained
thirsting
for
retaliation
for
their
check
on
palais
royale
square
the
men
did
not
probably
try
hard
to
restrain
them
the
prince
seeing
that
it
was
impossible
to
stop
the
movement
let
himself
be
carried
away
and
a
shriek
of
frightful
intensity
from
women
and
children
rose
to
heaven
as
a
claim
for
its
vengeance
a
dreadful
scene
took
place
in
the
gloom
the
victims
went
mad
with
pain
while
they
who
charged
were
mad
with
fury
a
kind
of
defense
was
organized
and
chairs
were
flung
at
the
cavalry
struck
on
the
head
prince
lambesq
replied
with
a
sword
cut
without
thinking
that
he
was
striking
the
innocent
for
the
guilty
an
old
man
was
sent
to
the
ground
billet
saw
this
and
he
uttered
a
shout
at
the
same
time
he
took
aim
with
his
rifle
and
the
prince
would
have
been
killed
but
for
his
horse
having
reared
at
the
very
instant
it
received
the
bullet
in
the
neck
and
died
instantly
the
fallen
prince
was
believed
slain
and
the
dragoons
rushed
into
the
tuileries
gardens
firing
their
pistols
at
the
fugitives
but
they
having
plenty
of
room
dodged
behind
the
trees
billet
tranquilly
reloaded
his
you
are
right
pitou
we
have
come
to
town
on
time
he
said
and
i
think
i
am
becoming
brave
remarked
pitou
standing
the
pistol
fire
of
a
horseman
and
spilling
him
out
of
the
saddle
with
his
musketoon
it
is
not
so
hard
as
i
thought
that
so
replied
the
other
but
useless
bravery
is
bravado
come
along
and
do
let
your
sword
trip
you
up
wait
for
me
father
billet
for
i
do
not
know
paris
like
you
do
and
without
you
i
shall
go
astray
come
come
said
the
farmer
leading
him
along
the
river
terrace
until
they
had
distanced
the
troops
advancing
by
the
quays
as
rapidly
as
they
could
to
help
the
lambesq
dragoons
if
needed
at
the
end
of
the
terrace
he
sat
on
the
parapet
and
jumped
down
on
the
embankment
running
along
the
river
pitou
did
the
same
chapter
ix
to
the
bastile
once
on
the
river
edge
the
two
countrymen
spying
arms
glitter
on
the
tuileries
bridge
in
all
probability
not
in
friendly
hands
lay
down
in
the
grass
beneath
the
trees
and
held
a
council
the
question
was
as
laid
down
by
the
elder
whether
they
ought
to
stay
where
they
were
in
comparative
safety
or
return
into
the
action
he
waited
for
pitou
opinion
pitou
had
grown
in
the
farmer
estimation
from
the
learning
he
had
shown
down
in
the
country
and
the
bravery
he
showed
this
evening
pitou
instinctively
felt
this
but
he
was
naturally
so
humble
that
he
was
only
the
more
grateful
to
his
friend
master
he
said
it
is
clear
that
you
are
braver
and
i
less
of
a
coward
than
was
supposed
by
ourselves
horace
the
poet
a
very
different
character
from
you
flung
down
his
weapons
and
took
to
his
heels
at
the
first
conflict
he
was
in
this
proves
that
i
am
more
courageous
than
horace
with
my
musket
and
sword
to
show
for
it
my
conclusion
is
that
the
bravest
man
in
the
world
may
be
killed
by
a
bullet
ergo
as
your
design
in
quitting
the
farm
was
to
come
to
paris
on
an
important
errand
by
all
that
is
blue
the
casket
you
have
hit
it
and
for
nothing
else
then
if
you
are
killed
the
business
will
not
come
off
quite
so
when
we
shall
have
seen
the
doctor
we
will
return
to
politics
as
a
sacred
duty
come
on
then
to
the
college
where
is
sebastian
gilbert
said
billet
rising
let
us
go
added
pitou
rising
but
reluctantly
so
soft
was
the
grass
besides
good
pitou
was
sleepy
if
anything
happens
me
you
must
know
what
to
say
to
gilbert
in
my
stead
but
be
mute
ange
was
not
saying
anything
for
he
was
dozing
if
i
should
be
mortally
wounded
you
must
go
to
the
doctor
and
say
bless
me
the
boy
asleep
indeed
pitou
was
snoring
where
he
had
sunk
down
again
after
all
the
college
will
be
shut
at
this
hour
thought
billet
we
had
better
take
a
rest
dawn
appeared
when
they
had
slept
three
hours
but
the
day
did
not
bring
any
change
in
the
warlike
aspect
of
paris
only
there
were
no
soldiers
to
be
seen
the
populace
were
everywhere
they
were
armed
with
quickly
made
pikes
guns
of
which
most
knew
not
the
use
and
old
time
weapons
of
which
the
bearers
admired
the
ornamentation
after
the
military
had
been
withdrawn
they
had
pillaged
the
royal
storage
magazines
towards
the
city
hall
a
crowd
rolled
a
couple
of
small
cannon
at
the
cathedral
and
other
places
the
general
alarm
was
rung
on
the
big
bells
out
from
between
the
flagstones
so
to
say
oozed
the
lowest
of
the
low
legions
of
men
and
women
if
human
they
were
pale
haggard
and
who
had
been
yelling
bread
the
night
before
but
howled
for
weapons
now
nothing
was
more
sinister
than
these
spectres
who
had
been
stealing
into
the
capital
from
all
the
country
round
during
the
last
few
months
they
slipped
silently
through
the
bars
and
installed
themselves
in
the
town
like
ghouls
in
a
cemetery
on
this
day
all
france
represented
in
the
capital
by
these
starvelings
called
out
to
the
king
make
us
free
while
howling
to
heaven
feed
us
meanwhile
billet
and
his
pupil
were
proceeding
to
the
college
on
the
way
they
saw
the
barricades
growing
up
with
even
children
lending
a
hand
and
the
richest
like
the
poorest
contributing
some
object
that
would
build
the
wall
among
the
crowds
billet
recognized
one
or
two
french
guardsmen
by
their
uniform
who
were
drilling
squads
and
teaching
the
use
of
firearms
with
the
women
and
boys
looking
on
the
college
was
insurrection
also
the
boys
had
driven
out
the
masters
and
were
attacking
the
gates
to
get
out
with
threats
which
terrified
the
tearful
principal
who
of
you
is
sebastian
gilbert
demanded
billet
in
his
voice
after
regarding
the
intestine
war
i
am
he
replied
a
boy
of
fifteen
of
almost
girlish
beauty
who
was
helping
three
or
four
schoolfellows
to
bring
up
a
ladder
with
which
to
scale
the
wall
as
they
could
not
force
the
lock
what
do
you
want
of
me
are
you
going
to
take
him
away
asked
the
head
teacher
alarmed
by
the
sight
of
two
armed
men
one
of
whom
the
speaker
was
covered
with
blood
the
boy
was
also
looking
at
them
without
recognizing
his
who
had
grown
out
of
all
reason
since
he
left
him
and
was
farther
disguised
by
the
martial
harness
take
away
gilbert
son
into
that
infernal
rumpus
said
the
yeoman
expose
him
to
some
ugly
blow
oh
dear
no
you
see
you
mad
fellow
sebastian
that
your
friends
do
not
approve
of
your
attempt
said
the
principal
for
these
gentlemen
do
appear
to
be
your
friends
aid
me
gentlemen
and
ye
my
children
obey
me
when
i
command
and
entreat
keep
my
mates
if
you
will
replied
young
gilbert
with
a
firmness
marvellous
at
his
age
but
i
must
go
forth
i
am
not
in
the
position
of
these
my
father
has
been
arrested
and
is
imprisoned
he
is
in
the
tyrant
power
yes
yes
shouted
the
boys
sebastian
is
right
they
have
locked
up
his
father
and
as
the
people
are
opening
the
prisons
they
must
set
his
father
free
eh
have
they
arrested
dr
gilbert
roared
the
farmer
shaking
the
gates
death
of
my
life
little
catherine
was
right
yes
they
have
taken
away
my
father
continued
little
gilbert
and
that
is
why
i
want
to
get
a
gun
and
fight
till
i
deliver
my
father
this
plan
was
hailed
by
a
hundred
shrill
voices
yes
give
us
weapons
let
us
fight
at
this
the
mob
outside
the
gates
ran
at
them
to
give
the
scholars
passage
the
principal
threw
himself
on
his
knees
to
supplicate
both
parties
crying
friends
friends
spare
tender
youth
spare
them
of
course
we
will
said
an
old
soldier
they
will
be
just
the
chaps
to
form
a
cadet
corps
with
but
they
are
a
sacred
deposit
entrusted
to
me
by
their
parents
continued
the
head
teacher
i
owe
my
life
to
them
so
in
name
do
not
take
away
my
lambs
hooting
from
both
sides
of
the
wall
killed
his
doleful
entreaties
billet
stepped
forward
and
interposed
between
the
soldiers
and
the
mob
and
the
schoolboys
the
old
gentleman
is
right
he
said
the
youngsters
are
a
sacred
trust
let
men
go
and
fight
and
get
knocked
over
that
is
their
duty
but
children
are
the
seed
for
the
future
a
disapproving
murmur
was
heard
who
grumbles
demanded
the
farmer
i
am
sure
it
is
not
a
father
now
i
am
a
father
i
have
had
two
men
killed
in
my
arms
this
last
night
it
is
their
blood
on
my
breast
see
he
showed
the
stains
to
the
assemblage
with
a
grand
gesture
electrifying
all
yesterday
i
was
fighting
at
the
palais
royale
and
in
the
tuileries
garden
resumed
the
farmer
and
this
lad
fought
by
my
side
but
then
he
has
no
father
or
mother
and
besides
he
is
almost
a
man
grown
pitou
looked
proud
i
shall
be
fighting
again
but
i
do
not
want
anybody
to
say
the
parisians
could
not
thrash
the
enemy
until
they
brought
the
children
to
help
them
the
man
right
chorussed
the
soldiers
and
women
no
children
in
the
fighting
keep
them
in
oh
thank
you
sir
said
the
head
master
to
billet
trying
to
shake
hands
with
him
through
the
bars
and
above
all
take
good
care
of
gilbert
said
the
latter
keep
me
in
i
tell
you
they
shall
not
cried
the
boy
livid
with
anger
as
he
struggled
in
the
grasp
of
the
school
servants
let
me
go
in
and
i
undertake
to
quiet
him
the
crowd
divided
and
let
the
farmer
and
pitou
go
into
the
schoolyard
already
three
or
four
french
guards
and
a
dozen
other
soldiers
instinctively
stood
sentry
at
the
gates
and
prevented
the
young
insurgents
from
bolting
out
billet
went
straight
up
to
sebastian
and
taking
his
fine
white
hands
in
his
large
horny
ones
said
sebastian
do
you
not
know
farmer
billet
who
farms
your
father
own
land
yes
sir
i
know
you
now
and
this
lad
with
me
it
must
be
ange
pitou
pitou
threw
himself
on
the
other
neck
blubbering
with
joy
if
they
have
taken
away
your
father
i
will
bring
him
back
i
and
the
rest
of
us
why
not
yesterday
we
had
a
with
the
austrians
and
we
saw
the
flat
of
their
backs
in
token
of
which
here
is
a
one
of
them
has
no
farther
use
for
added
ange
will
we
not
liberate
his
father
cried
billet
to
the
mob
who
shouted
an
assent
but
my
father
is
in
the
bastile
said
sebastian
shaking
his
head
in
melancholy
none
can
take
the
bastile
what
were
you
going
to
do
then
had
you
got
out
i
should
have
gone
under
the
bastile
walls
and
when
my
father
was
out
walking
on
the
ramparts
where
they
tell
me
the
prisoners
come
for
an
airing
i
should
have
shown
myself
to
him
but
if
the
sentinels
shot
you
when
they
caught
you
making
signs
to
a
prisoner
i
should
have
died
under
my
father
eyes
death
of
all
the
devils
you
are
a
bad
boy
to
want
to
get
killed
under
your
father
eyes
to
make
him
die
of
grief
in
his
cell
when
he
has
nobody
but
you
to
live
for
and
one
he
loves
so
well
plainly
you
have
no
good
heart
sebastian
a
bad
heart
whimpered
pitou
as
billet
repulsed
the
boy
while
the
boy
was
musing
sadly
the
farmer
admired
the
noble
face
white
and
pearly
the
fiery
eye
fine
and
ironical
mouth
eagle
nose
and
vigorous
chin
revealing
nobility
of
race
and
of
spirit
you
say
your
father
has
been
put
in
the
bastile
why
he
inquired
because
he
is
a
friend
of
washington
and
lafayette
has
fought
with
the
sword
for
the
independence
of
america
and
with
the
pen
for
france
is
known
in
the
two
worlds
as
a
hater
of
tyranny
because
he
has
cursed
this
bastile
where
others
were
suffering
and
now
he
is
there
himself
how
long
since
he
was
arrested
the
moment
he
landed
at
havre
at
least
at
lillebonne
for
he
wrote
me
a
letter
from
the
port
do
be
cross
my
boy
but
let
me
have
the
points
i
swear
to
deliver
your
father
from
the
bastile
or
leave
my
bones
at
the
foot
of
its
walls
sebastian
saw
that
the
former
spoke
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
and
he
replied
he
had
time
at
lillebonne
to
scribble
these
words
in
pencil
in
a
book
i
am
taken
to
the
bastile
patience
hope
and
labor
july
i
am
arrested
for
liberty
cause
i
have
a
son
at
college
paris
the
finder
of
this
book
is
begged
to
bear
this
note
on
to
my
son
sebastian
gilbert
in
the
name
of
humanity
and
the
book
inquired
billet
breathless
with
emotion
he
put
a
gold
piece
in
the
book
tied
a
string
round
it
and
threw
it
out
of
the
window
the
parish
priest
found
it
and
picked
out
a
sturdy
fellow
among
his
flock
to
whom
he
said
twelve
francs
with
your
family
who
are
without
bread
with
the
other
twelve
go
carry
this
book
to
paris
to
a
poor
boy
whose
father
has
been
taken
away
from
him
because
he
loves
the
people
too
well
the
young
man
got
in
yesterday
at
noon
he
handed
me
the
book
and
thus
i
knew
of
the
arrest
good
this
makes
me
friends
with
the
priests
again
exclaimed
billet
a
pity
they
are
not
all
built
on
this
pattern
what
about
the
peasant
he
went
back
last
evening
hoping
to
carry
his
family
the
five
francs
he
had
saved
on
the
journey
how
handsome
of
him
said
billet
oh
the
people
are
good
for
something
boy
now
you
know
all
you
promised
if
i
told
you
to
restore
me
my
father
i
said
i
should
or
get
killed
now

me
that
book
the
boy
drew
from
his
pocket
a
copy
of
rousseau
social
contract
billet
kissed
where
the
doctor
hand
had
traced
the
appeal
now
be
calm
he
said
i
am
going
to
fetch
your
father
from
the
bastile
madman
said
the
principal
grasping
his
hands
how
will
you
get
at
a
prisoner
of
state
by
taking
the
bastile
replied
the
farmer
some
guardsmen
laughed
and
the
merriment
became
general
hold
on
said
billet
casting
his
blazing
glance
around
him
what
is
this
bogey
castle
anyhow
only
stones
said
a
soldier
and
iron
said
another
and
fire
concluded
a
third
mind
you
do
not
burn
your
fingers
my
hero
yes
he
get
burnt
cried
the
crowd
what
roared
the
peasant
have
you
got
no
pickaxes
you
parisians
that
you
are
afraid
of
stone
walls
no
bullets
for
you
to
shrink
from
steel
no
powder
when
they
fire
on
you
you
must
be
cowards
then
dastards
machines
fit
for
slavery
a
thousand
demons
is
there
no
man
with
a
heart
who
will
come
with
me
and
pitou
to
have
a
go
at
this
bastile
of
the
king
i
am
billet
farmer
in
the
section
and
i
am
going
to
knock
at
that
door
come
on
billet
had
risen
to
the
summit
of
sublime
audacity
the
enflamed
and
quivering
multitude
around
him
shouted
down
with
the
bastile
sebastian
wished
to
cling
to
billet
but
he
gently
put
him
aside
your
father
bade
you
hope
and
have
patience
while
you
worked
well
we
are
going
to
work
too
only
the
other
name
for
our
work
is
slaying
and
destroying
the
youth
did
not
say
a
word
but
hiding
his
face
in
his
hands
he
went
off
into
spasms
which
compelled
them
to
take
him
into
the
sick
ward
on
to
the
bastile
called
out
billet
to
the
bastile
echoed
pitou
to
the
bastile
thundered
three
thousand
persons
a
cry
which
was
to
become
that
of
the
entire
population
of
paris
chapter
x
blowing
hot
and
cold
it
was
on
the
morning
of
the
fourteenth
of
july
that
billet
opened
oratorical
fire
against
the
monument
which
had
for
five
centuries
weighed
like
an
incubus
on
the
breast
of
france
a
rock
of
sisyphus
less
confident
than
the
titan
in
her
power
france
had
never
thought
to
throw
it
off
the
bastile
was
the
seal
of
feudalism
on
the
brow
of
paris
the
king
was
accounted
too
good
to
order
people
to
be
beheaded
but
he
sent
people
into
the
bastile
once
there
a
man
was
forgotten
isolated
sequestered
buried
alive
annihilated
he
stayed
there
till
the
monarch
remembered
him
and
kings
have
so
many
new
matters
to
think
of
that
they
often
forget
the
old
ones
there
were
twenty
other
bastiles
in
france
the
name
being
general
for
prison
so
that
to
this
day
the
tramp
on
the
dusty
road
speaks
of
the
steel
without
perhaps
knowing
that
the
title
of
ignominy
referred
to
the
great
french
statesprison
the
fortress
by
the
antoine
gate
was
bastile
it
was
alone
worth
all
the
others
some
of
the
prisoners
were
perhaps
great
criminals
but
others
like
latude
had
done
nothing
to
merit
thirty
years
captivity
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
lady
pompadour
the
king
mistress
and
wrote
her
a
note
which
caused
his
imprisonment
for
a
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
the
bastile
was
hated
by
the
people
it
was
hated
like
a
living
thing
a
monster
like
the
dragoons
who
defy
a
people
till
a
champion
rises
like
billet
to
show
them
how
to
attack
it
hence
one
may
comprehend
sebastian
hopeless
grief
at
his
father
being
incarcerated
in
the
bastile
hence
billet
belief
that
he
would
never
be
liberated
but
by
being
plucked
forth
hence
the
popular
transport
may
be
felt
when
the
shout
rose
of
down
with
the
bastile
but
it
was
as
the
soldiers
said
an
insane
project
to
think
of
capturing
the
king
the
bastile
had
a
garrison
artillery
and
provisions
the
walls
were
fifteen
feet
thick
at
the
top
and
forty
at
the
base
the
governor
was
count
launay
who
had
thirty
thousand
pounds
of
gunpowder
in
the
magazine
and
had
promised
in
case
of
annoyance
to
blow
up
the
fort
and
with
it
all
that
part
of
paris
nevertheless
billet
marched
forward
but
he
did
not
have
to
do
any
shouting
liking
his
martial
mien
the
multitude
felt
he
was
one
of
their
kind
and
commenting
on
his
words
and
bearing
it
followed
him
increasing
like
the
flowing
tide
when
billet
came
out
on
michel
quay
he
had
behind
him
more
than
three
thousand
men
armed
with
hatchets
cutlasses
pikes
and
guns
all
were
shouting
on
to
the
bastile
billet
was
making
the
reflections
which
his
knowledge
of
the
stronghold
warranted
and
the
vapor
of
his
enthusiasm
faded
gradually
he
saw
clearly
that
the
enterprise
was
sublime
though
insane
that
was
easy
to
understand
by
the
awed
expression
of
those
to
whom
he
had
first
broached
the
project
of
taking
the
bastile
but
he
was
only
the
more
fortified
in
his
resolve
but
he
understood
that
he
had
to
answer
to
these
mothers
and
fathers
girls
and
children
for
the
lives
of
those
whom
he
was
leading
and
that
he
was
bound
to
take
all
the
precautions
possible
he
commenced
by
collecting
his
followers
at
the
city
hall
he
appointed
lieutenants
to
control
the
flock
of
wolves
let
me
see
said
billet
to
himself
there
is
more
than
one
power
in
france
there
are
two
the
head
of
the
chief
city
for
one
and
may
be
another
yet
he
entered
the
city
hall
asking
for
the
chief
civic
magistrate
it
was
the
traders
provost
flesselles
my
lord
de
flesselles
he
repeated
a
noble
and
no
friend
of
the
people
oh
no
he
is
a
sensible
man
billet
went
up
the
stairs
into
the
where
he
met
an
usher
who
came
up
to
him
to
see
what
he
wanted
speech
with
lord
flesselles
replied
billet
ca
sir
answered
the
man
he
is
completing
the
list
for
the
militia
which
the
city
is
to
raise
capital
rejoined
billet
i
am
also
organizing
a
militia
and
as
i
have
three
thousand
men
ready
under
arms
i
am
worth
a
flesselles
who
is
only
going
to
get
his
together
let
me
speak
with
him
and
right
off
if
you
like
just
look
out
of
the
window
at
my
soldiers
one
rapid
glance
on
the
waterside
was
enough
for
the
servant
who
hastened
to
notify
the
traders
provost
to
whom
as
emphasis
to
his
message
he
pointed
out
the
army
this
sight
inspired
respect
in
the
provost
for
the
man
commanding
them
he
left
the
council
and
came
into
the
perceiving
billet
he
smiled
at
guessing
the
kind
of
man
he
must
be
were
you
wanting
me
he
challenged
if
you
are
provost
flesselles
responded
billet
yes
how
can
i
serve
you
please
be
quick
for
i
am
very
busy
how
many
powers
do
you
acknowledge
in
france
my
lord
provost
queried
billet
hem
that
is
just
how
one
looks
at
it
replied
the
politician
if
you
ask
bailly
the
mayor
he
will
say
national
assembly
if
lord
dreux
he
would
say
only
one
king
and
which
is
yours
between
the
two
neither
one
but
the
nation
at
present
rejoined
flesselles
playing
with
his
ruffles
ah
the
nation
repeated
the
farmer
those
gentlemen
waiting
below
there
with
the
and
the
nation
all
the
world
to
me
you
may
be
right
and
there
was
no
mistake
in
their
warranting
you
to
me
as
a
knowing
man
which
of
the
three
powers
do
you
belong
to
inquired
the
trimmer
bowing
faith
when
there
is
a
question
for
the
grand
spirit
and
the
angels
i
apply
to
the
fountain
head
you
mean
the
king
what
for
to
ask
for
the
release
of
gilbert
who
is
in
the
bastile
he
is
one
of
those
pamhleteers
i
believe
said
the
aristocratic
one
saucily
a
lover
of
mankind
that
is
all
one
my
dear
billet
i
believe
you
have
little
chances
of
obtaining
such
a
favor
from
the
king
if
he
put
the
doctor
in
his
bastile
he
had
reasons
for
it
all
right
returned
billet
he
shall
offer
his
reasons
and
i
will
match
them
with
mine
my
dear
sir
the
king
is
so
busy
that
he
will
not
receive
you
oh
if
he
will
not
let
me
in
i
shall
walk
in
without
his
leave
or
licence
but
you
will
find
lord
dreux
breze
at
the
door
who
will
put
you
away
from
it
it
is
true
he
failed
to
do
that
with
the
national
assembly
in
a
body
but
that
failure
will
only
the
more
put
him
on
his
mettle
and
he
will
take
his
revenge
out
of
you
then
i
will
apply
to
the
national
assembly
the
way
to
versailles
is
cut
off
i
will
have
my
three
thousand
men
with
me
have
a
care
my
dear
fellow
for
you
will
meet
on
the
road
four
or
five
thousand
swiss
soldiers
and
two
or
three
thousand
austrians
who
will
make
mincemeat
of
your
forces
in
a
twinkling
you
will
be
swallowed
what
the
deuse
am
i
to
do
then
do
what
you
like
but
rid
me
of
your
three
thousand
tatterdemalions
who
are
cracking
the
flagstones
with
thumps
of
their
halberds
and
smoking
in
the
vaults
are
seven
or
eight
thousand
pounds
of
gunpowder
and
a
spark
may
send
us
all
flying
to
the
eternal
throne
in
that
case
turning
this
over
in
my
mind
said
the
farmer
i
will
not
trouble
the
king
or
the
assembly
but
call
in
the
nation
and
take
the
bastile
myself
with
what
with
the
powder
you
have
kindly
told
me
is
stored
in
your
cellar
you
do
tell
me
that
sneered
flesselles
that
is
the
very
thing
the
cellar
keys
my
lord
hello
you
are
joking
faltered
the
gentleman
i
never
joke
returned
billet
grasping
the
provost
by
the
collar
with
both
hands
let
me
have
the
keys
or
i
shall
sling
you
out
to
my
tatterdemalions
who
know
how
to
pick
pockets
flesselles
turned
pale
as
death
his
lips
and
teeth
closed
so
convulsively
but
his
voice
did
not
alter
in
tone
from
the
ironical
one
adopted
to
tell
you
the
truth
sir
you
do
me
assistance
in
ridding
me
of
this
combustible
he
said
so
i
will
hand
you
over
the
keys
as
you
desire
only
do
not
forget
that
i
am
your
first
magistrate
and
that
if
you
are
so
unfortunate
as
to
handle
me
roughly
before
others
as
you
have
done
catching
me
privately
in
an
unguarded
time
you
will
be
hanged
within
the
hour
by
the
city
guards
do
you
persist
in
removing
this
powder
i
do
and
will
divide
it
out
myself
right
away
let
us
have
this
clear
then
i
have
business
here
for
an
other
quarter
of
an
hour
and
if
it
makes
no
difference
to
you
i
should
prefer
the
distribution
to
go
on
during
my
absence
it
has
been
foretold
me
that
i
should
die
of
a
violent
death
but
i
own
to
having
a
deep
repugnance
to
being
blown
into
the
air
you
shall
have
the
time
but
do
me
a
favor
in
return
come
to
this
window
that
i
may
make
you
popular
much
obliged
in
what
manner
you
shall
see
friends
he
called
out
as
the
two
stood
at
the
window
you
want
to
take
the
bastile
ay
ay
replied
the
thousands
of
voices
but
we
want
powder
now
here
is
the
provost
who
gives
us
all
there
is
in
the
city
hall
cellars
thank
him
boys
long
live
the
provost
flesselles
forever
roared
the
mob
now
my
lord
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
collar
you
before
the
crowd
or
when
alone
said
billet
for
if
you
do
not
give
the
powder
the
people
or
the
nation
as
you
call
it
will
tear
you
to
pieces
here
are
the
keys
your
way
of
asking
for
anything
allows
no
refusing
this
encourages
me
said
billet
who
was
meditating
hang
it
all
have
you
more
to
ask
yes
if
you
know
governor
launay
of
the
bastile
he
is
a
friend
of
mine
in
that
case
you
can
not
wish
evil
to
befall
him
to
prevent
that
ask
him
to
give
up
the
prison
to
me
or
at
least
the
prisoner
gilbert
you
can
not
hope
that
i
have
any
such
influence
that
is
my
lookout
all
i
want
is
an
introduction
to
him
my
dear
billet
i
must
warn
you
that
if
you
enter
the
bastile
it
will
be
alone
and
it
is
likely
that
you
will
never
come
out
again
still
i
will
give
you
a
passport
into
the
bastile
on
one
condition
that
you
do
not
ask
me
another
for
the
moon
i
have
no
acquaintances
lunatics
flesselles
shrilled
a
harsh
voice
behind
the
speaker
if
you
continue
to
wear
two
faces
one
laughing
with
the
aristocrats
and
the
other
smiling
on
the
people
you
will
be
signing
your
own
passport
in
a
day
or
two
to
the
other
world
whence
none
return
who
speak
thus
cried
the
provost
turning
to
the
man
who
interrupted
i
marat
the
surgeon
marat
the
philosopher
said
billet
yes
the
same
marat
continued
flesselles
who
as
a
medical
man
ought
to
attend
to
the
insane
he
will
have
his
hands
full
in
france
at
this
moment
provost
flesselles
replied
the
sombre
surgeon
this
honest
citizen
asks
a
passport
to
governor
launay
i
would
point
out
that
you
are
not
only
keeping
him
waiting
but
three
thousand
other
honest
citizens
very
well
he
shall
have
it
going
to
a
table
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
before
writing
with
the
other
a
few
rapid
lines
in
ink
here
is
your
introduction
he
said
presenting
it
to
the
countryman
i
do
not
know
how
to
read
said
billet
give
it
to
me
and
i
will
do
so
said
marat
and
he
saw
that
the
pass
was
couched
in
these
words
governor
we
provost
of
traders
of
paris
send
you
billet
to
confer
on
the
welfare
of
the
city
july
flesselles
all
right
let
me
have
it
said
billet
oh
you
think
it
good
enough
sneered
marat
wait
for
the
provost
to
add
a
postscript
which
will
improve
it
he
went
over
to
the
provost
who
was
leaning
one
closed
hand
on
the
table
and
regarding
with
a
scornful
air
not
only
the
two
men
who
were
the
jaws
of
a
vice
which
enclosed
him
but
a
third
whose
breeches
were
torn
standing
before
the
doorway
with
a
musketoon
in
his
fist
this
was
pitou
who
followed
his
friend
and
was
ready
to
execute
any
order
of
his
i
suggest
the
following
postscript
to
improve
the
paper
said
marat
speak
marat
laid
the
paper
again
on
the
table
and
pointing
with
his
crooked
finger
to
the
place
for
the
addendum
he
dictated
citizen
billet
being
under
flag
of
truce
i
confide
his
life
to
your
honor
flesselles
looked
at
the
cunning
face
as
if
he
had
a
strongest
desire
to
smash
it
with
a
blow
than
do
what
he
was
counselled
do
you
hesitate
demanded
the
surgeon
no
for
at
the
most
you
only
ask
what
is
fair
replied
the
other
writing
as
proposed
still
gentlemen
i
want
you
to
bear
in
mind
that
i
do
not
answer
for
the
envoy
safety
but
i
will
said
marat
taking
the
paper
from
his
hands
for
your
liberty
is
here
to
answer
for
his
your
head
will
guarantee
his
there
is
your
pass
my
brave
billet
flesselles
called
for
his
coach
and
said
loudly
i
suppose
my
friends
you
are
asking
nothing
more
no
replied
the
two
together
am
i
to
let
him
pass
asked
pitou
my
young
friend
said
the
gentleman
i
should
like
to
observe
that
you
are
rather
too
insufficiently
clad
to
stand
guard
at
my
door
if
you
feel
constrained
to
do
it
at
least
sling
your
round
and
stand
with
your
back
to
the
wall
am
i
to
let
him
go
asked
pitou
again
looking
at
the
speaker
as
if
he
did
not
relish
the
jest
yes
billet
said
perhaps
you
are
wrong
to
let
him
go
said
marat
as
pitou
stepped
aside
he
was
a
good
hostage
to
hold
but
in
any
case
be
he
where
he
may
i
can
lay
hands
on
him
never
fear
labrie
said
flesselles
to
his
valet
as
he
got
into
his
carriage
they
are
going
to
serve
out
the
powder
if
the
city
hall
goes
up
in
an
explosion
i
should
like
to
be
well
out
of
the
reach
of
splinters
tell
the
coachman
to
whip
up
smartly
the
vehicle
rolled
under
the
covered
way
and
came
out
on
the
square
before
some
thousands
of
spectators
the
provost
feared
that
his
departure
might
be
misinterpreted
and
taken
for
a
flight
so
he
leaned
out
of
the
window
and
said
loudly
drive
to
the
national
assembly
this
earned
him
a
cheer
up
on
the
balcony
outside
marat
and
billet
heard
the
order
my
head
to
his
that
he
is
not
going
to
the
assembly
but
to
the
king
commented
the
surgeon
had
he
not
better
be
stopped
said
the
farmer
no
replied
the
other
with
a
hideous
grin
be
easy
go
where
he
may
and
however
quickly
we
shall
travel
more
quickly
than
he
now
let
us
get
out
that
powder
out
with
the
powder
said
billet
flesselles
was
right
in
saying
there
were
eight
thousand
pounds
of
gunpowder
in
the
vaults
marat
and
billet
walked
in
the
first
with
a
lantern
which
they
hung
to
a
beam
pitou
mounted
guard
at
the
door
the
powder
was
in
kegs
men
were
stationed
in
a
line
and
the
kegs
were
passed
out
hand
to
hand
there
was
a
brief
confusion
as
it
was
not
known
what
was
the
amount
and
some
feared
they
could
not
get
any
if
they
did
not
scramble
for
it
but
billet
had
selected
his
lieutenants
on
his
own
model
with
fists
and
the
distribution
went
on
with
much
order
each
man
received
half
a
pound
of
powder
which
would
fire
thirty
or
forty
shots
but
when
everybody
had
powder
it
was
discovered
that
guns
were
short
only
some
five
hundred
men
had
them
while
the
powder
was
being
dealt
out
some
of
the
unarmed
went
into
a
council
chamber
where
a
debate
was
proceeding
it
was
about
the
national
guards
of
which
the
usher
had
mentioned
a
word
to
billet
it
was
settled
that
the
force
should
consist
of
thousand
men
the
army
existed
only
on
paper
and
yet
they
were
wrangling
about
who
should
have
the
command
in
the
midst
of
this
dispute
in
rushed
the
weaponless
men
the
people
had
formed
an
army
of
their
own
but
they
wanted
arms
at
this
moment
was
heard
the
arrival
of
a
carriage
it
was
flesselles
for
they
would
not
let
him
pass
though
he
had
shown
the
royal
order
for
him
to
go
to
versailles
and
he
was
brought
back
to
the
hall
by
main
force
arms
arms
they
yelled
at
him
as
soon
as
they
saw
him
no
arms
here
but
there
must
be
some
at
the
arsenal
he
replied
so
five
thousand
men
ran
over
to
the
arsenal
to
find
it
was
bare
they
returned
howling
to
the
city
hall
the
provost
had
no
firearms
or
he
would
not
tell
of
them
he
packed
them
off
to
the
old
carthusian
monastery
but
it
was
empty
too
not
so
much
as
a
pocket
pistol
rewarded
them
meanwhile
flesselles
learning
that
marat
and
billet
were
still
busy
getting
out
the
powder
suggested
sending
a
deputation
to
governor
launay
to
induce
him
to
draw
in
the
cannon
he
had
made
the
populace
howl
dreadfully
on
the
evening
before
by
running
out
his
guns
through
the
embrasures
flesselles
hoped
that
by
having
them
taken
in
the
people
would
be
satisfied
and
settle
down
the
deputation
was
starting
when
the
came
back
enraged
on
hearing
their
vociferations
billet
and
marat
came
up
out
of
the
underground
on
a
lower
balcony
the
provost
was
trying
to
quiet
the
multitude
he
proposed
a
resolution
that
the
wards
should
forge
fifty
thousand
pikes
the
people
were
jumping
at
the
offer
truly
this
fellow
is
playing
with
us
said
the
surgeon
he
turned
to
his
new
friend
saying
go
and
get
to
work
at
the
bastile
in
an
hour
i
shall
be
sending
you
twenty
thousand
muskets
with
a
man
to
each
butt
at
first
blush
billet
had
felt
great
confidence
in
this
leader
whose
name
was
so
popular
as
to
have
reached
him
down
in
the
country
he
never
thought
to
ask
him
how
he
was
going
to
get
them
he
noticed
a
priest
in
the
crowd
working
lustily
and
though
he
had
no
great
confidence
in
the
cloth
he
liked
this
one
to
whom
he
confided
the
serving
out
of
the
amunition
marat
jumped
upon
a
stone
horseblock
the
uproar
was
indescribable
silence
he
called
out
i
am
marat
and
i
want
to
speak
like
magic
all
was
hushed
and
every
eye
was
turned
upon
the
orator
you
want
arms
to
take
the
bastile
come
with
me
to
the
invalides
where
are
thousand
stand
of
arms
and
you
shall
have
them
to
the
invalides
shouted
the
throngs
now
continued
marat
to
billet
you
be
off
to
the
bastile
but
stay
you
may
want
help
before
i
come
he
wrote
on
a
leaf
of
his
tablets
from
marat
and
tore
this
out
to
give
it
to
billet
who
smiled
to
see
that
it
also
bore
a
masonic
sign
he
and
marat
belonged
to
the
order
of
the
invisibles
over
which
presided
and
his
work
was
what
they
were
prosecuting
what
am
i
to
do
with
a
paper
having
no
name
or
address
inquired
the
peasant
my
friend
has
no
address
but
his
name
is
ask
the
first
workingman
you
come
across
for
the
people
spokesman
gonchon
gonchon
fix
that
on
your
mind
pitou
gonchon
or
gonchonius
in
latin
repeated
pitou
i
shall
retain
it
to
the
invalides
yelled
the
voices
with
increasing
ferocity
be
on
your
way
said
marat
and
may
the
spirit
of
liberty
march
by
your
side
now
then
brothers
on
to
the
invalides
shouted
marat
in
his
turn
he
went
off
with
more
than
twenty
thousand
men
while
the
farmer
took
away
some
six
hundred
in
his
train
but
they
were
armed
as
the
two
leaders
were
departing
the
provost
appeared
at
a
window
calling
out
friends
why
do
i
see
the
green
cockade
in
your
hats
when
it
is
the
color
of
artois
though
it
may
also
be
that
of
hope
do
look
to
be
sporting
the
colors
of
a
prince
no
no
was
the
chorus
with
billet
loudest
of
the
voices
then
change
it
and
as
if
you
must
wear
a
color
take
that
good
old
paris
town
our
mother
blue
and
red
my
friends
later
general
lafayette
making
the
criticism
that
blue
and
red
were
the
orleans
colors
also
and
perhaps
having
the
stars
and
stripes
of
the
republic
he
had
fought
for
in
his
mind
suggested
the
addition
of
white
saying
that
the
red
white
and
blue
would
be
a
flag
that
would
go
round
the
world
with
approving
words
everybody
tore
off
the
leaves
and
trampled
them
underfoot
while
they
called
for
ribbons
as
if
by
enchantment
all
windows
opened
and
there
was
a
rain
of
red
and
blue
ribbons
but
this
was
scant
supply
for
a
thousand
only
aprons
silk
dresses
tapes
scarves
all
sorts
of
tissues
were
torn
into
strips
and
twisted
up
into
rosettes
streamers
favors
and
ties
with
which
decorations
the
improvised
army
of
billet
went
its
road
it
had
recruits
on
the
line
all
the
side
streets
of
the
antoine
or
working
quarter
sent
the
warmest
blooded
and
strongest
of
its
sons
they
reached
in
good
order
lesdigures
street
where
a
number
of
folk
were
staring
at
the
bastile
towers
their
red
brick
ruddy
in
the
setting
sunshine
some
were
calm
some
saucy
in
the
instant
the
arrivals
of
reinforcements
changed
the
multitude
in
aspect
and
mood
they
were
the
drumcorps
a
hundred
french
guards
who
came
down
the
main
avenue
and
billet
rough
fellows
upwards
of
twelve
thousand
strong
the
timid
grew
bold
the
calm
were
excited
and
the
pert
were
menacing
down
with
the
cannon
howled
twenty
thousand
throats
as
twice
as
many
fists
were
shaken
at
the
brazen
pieces
stretching
their
necks
over
the
crenelations
at
that
very
time
as
though
the
fortress
governor
obeyed
the
injunction
the
gunners
came
out
to
the
pieces
and
retired
them
until
they
were
no
longer
visible
from
below
the
throngs
clapped
hands
thinking
they
were
a
power
because
they
had
apparently
been
obeyed
the
sentries
continued
to
pace
up
and
down
the
ramparts
with
alternations
of
the
swiss
and
the
veterans
after
the
shout
of
down
with
the
cannons
that
of
draw
back
the
swiss
arose
in
continuation
of
down
with
the
germans
of
the
evening
before
but
the
swiss
continued
all
the
same
to
march
up
and
down
to
meet
the
french
invalides
one
of
the
shouters
was
impatient
and
having
a
gun
he
fired
on
a
sentinel
the
bullet
struck
the
grey
stone
wall
a
foot
above
the
cornice
of
the
tower
above
the
soldier
head
it
left
a
white
mark
but
the
man
did
not
halt
did
not
do
much
as
turn
his
head
a
great
hubbub
rose
around
the
firer
of
the
first
shot
at
the
bastile
it
was
the
signal
for
a
mad
and
attack
the
tumult
had
more
dread
in
it
than
rage
many
did
not
understand
that
to
fire
on
a
royal
prison
was
incurring
the
death
penalty
chapter
xi
the
prison
governor
billet
looked
at
the
mossgrown
edifice
resembling
the
monsters
of
fable
covered
with
scales
he
counted
the
embrasures
where
the
great
guns
might
be
run
out
again
and
the
which
opened
their
ominous
eye
to
peer
through
the
loopholes
he
shook
his
head
recalling
flesselles
words
we
never
get
in
he
muttered
why
never
questioned
a
voice
at
his
elbow
turning
he
saw
a
beggar
in
rags
but
with
eyes
glittering
like
stars
in
their
hollow
sockets
because
it
is
hard
to
take
such
a
pile
by
main
strength
taking
the
bastile
is
not
a
matter
of
strength
replied
the
mendicant
but
an
act
of
faith
have
as
little
faith
as
a
grain
of
and
yet
you
can
overturn
a
mountain
believe
we
can
do
it
and
good
night
bastile
wait
a
bit
muttered
billet
fumbling
for
marat
recommendation
in
his
pocket
wait
reiterated
the
vagabond
mistaking
his
mind
yes
i
can
understand
you
being
willing
to
wait
for
you
are
a
farmer
and
have
always
had
more
than
enough
to
make
you
fat
but
look
at
my
mates
the
and
surrounding
us
see
their
veins
dried
up
count
their
bones
through
the
holes
in
their
tatters
and
ask
them
if
they
know
what
waiting
in
patience
means
this
man
speaks
glibly
but
he
frightens
me
remarked
pitou
he
does
not
frighten
me
replied
billet
then
turning
to
the
stranger
he
went
on
i
say
patience
because
in
a
yet
we
shall
do
i
ca
call
that
much
answered
the
vagrant
smiling
but
how
much
better
off
will
we
be
then
i
shall
have
visited
the
bastile
by
then
rejoined
the
i
shall
know
how
strong
the
garrison
is
and
the
governor
intention
i
shall
in
short
have
a
glimpse
of
how
we
can
get
in
it
will
do
if
you
see
how
to
get
out
well
as
to
that
if
i
do
not
come
out
i
know
a
man
who
will
fetch
me
out
who
is
he
gonchon
the
people
spokesman
their
orator
their
mirabeau
you
do
know
him
said
the
man
his
eyes
flashing
fire
so
how
do
you
make
that
out
i
am
going
to
know
him
i
was
told
that
the
first
person
i
addressed
on
bastile
square
would
take
me
to
him
you
are
on
the
spot
lead
me
to
him
what
do
you
want
of
him
to
hand
him
this
paper
from
surgeon
marat
whom
i
have
just
left
at
the
city
hall
whence
he
was
marching
to
the
invalides
to
get
muskets
for
his
twenty
thousand
men
in
this
case
hand
over
the
paper
i
am
gonchon
friends
added
the
vagabond
as
billet
drew
back
a
step
here
is
a
chap
who
does
not
know
me
and
asks
if
i
am
really
gonchon
the
mass
burst
into
laughter
it
seemed
impossible
that
their
favorite
should
not
be
known
to
all
long
life
to
gonchon
was
the
shout
there
you
are
said
billet
passing
the
paper
to
him
mates
said
the
popular
leader
having
read
and
slapping
the
bearer
on
the
shoulder
this
is
a
brother
whom
marat
recommends
so
you
may
rely
on
him
what
is
your
name
billet
my
name
is
do
you
see
between
us
i
hope
we
shall
cut
something
the
mob
laughed
at
the
ominous
pun
ay
somebody
will
get
cut
was
the
cry
how
are
we
to
set
about
it
we
are
going
right
into
there
answered
gonchon
pointing
to
the
building
that
is
the
right
kind
of
talk
said
the
farmer
how
many
have
you
gonchon
thirty
skeletons
thirty
thousand
of
yours
and
twenty
coming
from
the
hospital
ten
thousand
here
more
than
enough
to
succeed
if
we
are
to
succeed
we
shall
replied
the
beggar
king
i
believe
you
get
your
men
in
hand
while
i
go
in
and
summon
the
governor
to
surrender
if
he
should
so
much
the
better
as
it
will
spare
bloodshed
if
not
the
blood
will
fall
on
his
head
and
it
is
bad
luck
these
times
ask
those
german
dragoons
who
hewed
down
the
inoffensive
how
long
will
you
be
engaged
with
the
governor
as
long
as
i
can
make
it
so
as
to
have
the
castle
invested
thoroughly
if
possible
the
moment
i
come
out
begin
the
onset
enough
said
you
do
distrust
me
said
the
countryman
holding
out
his
hand
to
the
city
ragamuffin
i
distrust
you
replied
the
other
shaking
with
his
emaciated
hand
the
plump
one
of
the
farmer
with
a
vigor
he
had
not
expected
wherefore
with
a
word
or
a
sign
i
could
have
you
ground
into
dust
though
you
were
sheltered
by
yon
towers
which
will
exist
not
were
you
protected
by
those
soldiers
who
will
be
our
or
we
shall
be
theirs
go
ahead
and
rely
on
gonchon
as
he
does
on
billet
convinced
the
farmer
walked
towards
the
bastile
gateway
while
his
new
comrade
proceeded
towards
the
dwellings
under
cheers
for
the
mirabeau
i
never
saw
the
other
mirabeau
thought
pitou
but
ours
is
not
handsome
towards
the
city
the
bastile
presented
two
twin
towers
while
its
two
sides
faced
where
the
canal
runs
the
entrance
was
defended
by
an
outpost
house
two
lines
of
sentinels
and
two
over
moats
after
getting
over
these
obstacles
one
reached
the
government
yard
where
the
governor
residence
was
hence
a
corridor
led
to
the
ditches
another
entrance
also
leading
to
the
ditches
had
a
drawbridge
a
guardhouse
and
an
iron
grating
as
portcullis
at
the
first
entry
they
stopped
billet
but
he
showed
the
flesselles
introduction
and
they
did
not
turn
him
back
perceiving
that
pitou
followed
him
as
he
would
have
locked
steps
with
him
and
marched
up
to
the
moon
he
said
stay
outside
if
i
do
not
return
it
will
be
well
for
somebody
to
be
around
to
remind
the
people
that
i
went
in
just
so
how
long
shall
i
wait
an
hour
what
about
the
casket
inquired
the
youth
if
i
do
not
come
out
if
gonchon
does
not
take
the
bastile
or
if
having
taken
it
i
am
not
to
be
found
tell
gilbert
who
may
be
found
that
men
from
paris
stole
the
box
he
entrusted
to
me
five
years
ago
that
on
arriving
in
town
i
learnt
he
was
put
in
the
bastile
whence
i
strove
to
rescue
him
but
left
my
skin
which
was
entirely
at
his
service
very
good
father
billet
said
the
peasant
it
is
rather
long
and
i
am
afraid
of
forgetting
it
i
will
repeat
it
better
write
it
said
a
voice
hard
by
i
can
not
write
rejoined
billet
i
can
for
i
am
clerk
to
the
chatelet
prison
my
name
is
maillard
stanislaus
maillard
he
was
a
man
of
tall
and
slim
grave
and
clad
in
black
as
became
such
a
functionary
he
drew
a
from
his
pocket
containing
writing
materials
he
looks
devilish
like
an
undertaker
muttered
pitou
you
say
said
the
clerk
imperturbably
writing
that
men
from
paris
took
from
your
dwelling
a
casket
entrusted
to
you
by
gilbert
that
is
an
offense
to
begin
with
they
belonged
to
the
paris
police
infamous
theft
said
maillard
here
is
your
memorandum
young
man
he
added
giving
the
note
to
ange
if
he
be
slain
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
both
of
us
will
not
i
will
do
it
if
you
both
go
down
thank
you
said
billet
giving
his
hand
to
the
clerk
who
grasped
it
with
more
power
than
one
might
accredit
to
the
meager
frame
so
i
may
rely
on
you
as
on
marat
and
gonchon
such
triplets
are
not
born
everyday
thought
pitou
who
only
said
be
prudent
father
billet
do
not
forget
that
the
most
prudent
thing
in
france
is
courage
said
the
farmer
with
his
blunt
eloquence
sometimes
startling
in
his
rough
body
he
passed
the
first
line
of
sentinels
while
pitou
backed
out
at
the
bridge
he
had
to
parley
but
it
was
lowered
on
his
showing
his
pass
and
the
iron
grating
was
raised
behind
the
portcullis
was
the
governor
this
inner
yard
was
the
prisoners
exercise
ground
eight
giant
towers
guarded
it
no
window
opened
into
it
the
sun
never
penetrated
its
circuit
where
the
pavement
was
damp
almost
muddy
here
a
clock
the
face
upheld
by
chained
captives
in
carving
dropped
the
seconds
like
water
oozing
through
a
ceiling
on
the
dungeon
slabs
at
the
bottom
of
this
pit
the
prisoner
lost
in
the
stony
gulf
would
glance
up
at
the
inexorable
nakedness
and
sue
to
be
led
back
into
his
cell
governor
launay
was
about
fifty
years
of
age
he
wore
a
grey
linseywoolsey
suit
this
day
it
was
crossed
by
a
red
sash
of
the
order
of
louis
and
he
carried
a
swordcane
he
was
a
bad
man
memoirs
had
just
shown
him
up
in
a
sad
light
and
he
was
hated
almost
as
much
as
the
jail
his
father
had
been
governor
before
him
the
officers
here
were
on
the
purchase
system
so
that
the
officials
tried
to
make
all
the
money
they
could
squeeze
out
of
the
prisoners
and
their
friends
the
governor
chief
warder
doubled
his
francs
appointments
by
extortion
in
the
way
of
meanness
launay
his
foregoers
he
may
have
had
to
pay
more
highly
for
the
post
than
his
father
and
so
had
to
put
on
the
screw
to
retrieve
his
outlay
he
fed
his
household
out
of
the
prisoners
rations
he
reduced
the
firing
allowance
and
doubled
the
hire
of
furniture
maybe
he
foresaw
that
he
was
not
to
enjoy
the
berth
long
he
had
the
right
to
pass
a
hundred
casks
of
wine
into
paris
free
of
duty
he
sold
it
to
a
who
got
in
the
best
vintage
and
supplied
him
for
the
prisoners
with
vinegar
the
latter
had
one
relief
one
pleasure
a
little
garden
made
on
a
bastion
where
they
got
a
whiff
of
sweet
air
and
saw
flowers
and
grass
and
sunshine
he
let
this
out
to
a
robbing
the
prisoners
for
fifty
livres
on
the
other
hand
he
was
yielding
to
rich
captives
he
let
one
furnish
his
room
in
his
own
style
and
have
any
visitors
he
liked
for
further
particulars
see
the
bastile
unveiled
for
all
this
launay
was
brave
he
might
be
pale
but
he
was
calm
although
the
storm
had
raged
against
him
from
the
previous
evening
he
felt
aware
of
the
riot
becoming
a
revolt
for
the
waves
broke
at
the
foot
of
his
castle
wall
it
is
true
that
he
had
four
cannon
and
a
garrison
of
old
soldiers
and
swiss
with
only
one
unarmed
man
confronting
him
for
billet
had
handed
his
to
ange
on
entering
the
stronghold
he
understood
that
a
weapon
might
get
him
into
trouble
beyond
the
barrier
with
a
glance
he
remarked
everything
the
governor
calm
and
menacing
attitude
the
swiss
ranked
in
the
guardhouses
the
veterans
on
the
platforms
and
the
silent
bustle
of
the
artillerists
loading
up
their
caissons
with
ammunition
the
sentinels
had
their
muskets
on
their
shoulders
and
their
officers
carried
drawn
swords
as
the
commander
stood
still
billet
was
obliged
to
go
to
him
the
grating
closed
behind
the
people
parliamentarian
with
an
ugly
grinding
of
metal
on
metal
which
made
him
shudder
to
the
marrow
brave
though
he
was
what
do
you
want
again
challenged
launay
again
took
up
billet
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
the
first
time
you
have
seen
me
so
that
you
can
not
be
very
tired
of
me
i
was
told
you
come
from
the
city
hall
and
i
have
just
had
a
deputation
from
there
to
get
me
to
promise
not
to
open
fire
i
promised
that
much
and
so
i
had
the
guns
drawn
in
i
was
on
the
square
as
you
did
so
and
i
you
thought
i
was
giving
way
to
the
calls
of
the
crowd
it
looked
that
way
replied
the
farmer
did
i
not
tell
you
that
they
would
believe
me
just
such
a
coward
said
launay
turning
round
to
his
officers
who
do
you
come
from
then
he
demanded
of
billet
i
come
on
behalf
of
the
people
rejoined
the
visitor
proudly
that
is
all
very
well
sneered
launay
smiling
but
you
must
have
shown
some
other
warrant
for
otherwise
you
would
not
have
passed
the
first
of
sentries
true
i
have
a
pass
from
your
friend
flesselles
flesselles
why
do
you
dub
him
my
friend
exclaimed
the
prison
warden
looking
at
the
speaker
to
read
to
the
bottom
of
his
mind
how
do
you
conclude
that
he
is
a
friend
of
mine
i
supposed
as
much
is
that
all
never
mind
let
us
see
your
billet
presented
the
paper
which
launay
read
more
than
once
in
order
to
catch
a
hidden
meaning
or
concealed
lines
he
even
held
it
up
to
the
light
to
see
if
there
was
secret
writing
is
that
all
are
you
perfectly
sure
nothing
by
word
of
mouth
in
addition
not
a
bit
strange
said
launay
plunging
his
glance
by
a
loophole
on
bastile
square
then
tell
me
your
want
and
be
quick
the
people
want
you
to
give
up
the
bastile
what
do
you
say
cried
launay
turning
quickly
as
if
he
must
be
mistaken
in
his
hearing
i
summon
you
in
the
people
name
to
give
up
the
bastile
queer
animals
the
people
sneered
launay
snapping
his
fingers
what
do
they
want
with
the
bastile
to
demolish
it
why
what
the
mischief
is
the
bastile
to
the
people
is
any
common
man
ever
shut
up
herein
why
the
people
ought
to
bless
every
stone
of
the
bastile
who
are
locked
up
here
philosophers
learned
men
aristocrats
statesmen
princes
all
the
enemies
of
the
dregs
this
only
proves
that
the
people
are
not
selfish
and
want
to
do
good
to
others
it
is
plain
that
you
are
not
a
soldier
my
friend
said
the
other
with
a
kind
of
pity
it
is
true
and
come
fresh
from
the
country
for
you
do
not
know
what
the
bastile
is
come
with
me
and
i
will
show
you
he
is
going
to
pull
the
spring
of
some
trap
which
will
open
beneath
my
feet
thought
the
adventurer
and
then
old
billet
but
he
was
intrepid
and
did
not
wince
as
he
prepared
to
accede
to
the
invitation
in
the
first
place
continued
launay
it
is
well
to
know
that
i
have
enough
powder
in
the
store
to
blow
up
the
castle
and
lay
half
the
suburbs
in
ashes
i
knew
that
was
the
tranquil
reply
do
you
see
these
cannon
they
rake
this
gallery
which
is
defended
by
a
guardhouse
and
by
two
ditches
only
to
be
crossed
by
lastly
there
is
a
portcullis
oh
i
am
not
saying
that
the
bastile
will
be
badly
defended
but
that
it
will
be
well
attacked
to
proceed
here
is
a
postern
opening
on
the
moats
observe
the
thickness
of
the
walls
forty
feet
here
and
fifteen
above
you
see
that
though
the
people
have
nails
they
will
break
against
such
walls
i
am
not
saying
that
the
people
will
demolish
the
bastile
to
master
it
but
that
having
mastered
it
they
will
demolish
it
said
the
leader
of
the
revolutionists
let
us
go
upstairs
said
the
governor
leading
up
thirty
steps
where
he
paused
to
say
this
embrasure
opens
on
the
passage
by
which
you
would
be
bound
to
come
it
is
defended
by
one
rampart
gun
but
it
enjoys
a
fair
reputation
you
know
the
song
my
sackbut
i
love
your
dear
song
certainly
i
have
heard
it
but
i
do
not
think
this
a
time
to
sing
it
or
anything
else
stay
marshal
saxe
called
this
gun
his
sackbut
because
it
sang
the
only
music
he
cared
anything
for
this
is
a
historical
fact
but
let
us
go
on
oh
said
billet
when
upon
the
tower
top
you
have
not
dismounted
the
cannon
but
merely
drawn
them
in
i
shall
have
to
tell
the
people
so
the
cannon
were
mounted
here
by
the
king
command
and
by
that
alone
can
they
be
dismounted
governor
launay
returned
billet
feeling
himself
rise
to
the
level
of
the
emergency
the
true
sovereign
is
yonder
and
i
counsel
you
to
obey
it
he
pointed
to
the
masses
spotted
with
blood
from
the
night
battling
and
reflecting
the
dying
sunlight
on
their
weapons
up
to
the
very
moats
friend
a
man
can
not
know
two
masters
replied
the
royalist
holding
his
head
up
haughtily
i
the
governor
of
the
bastile
know
but
one
the
sixteenth
louis
who
put
his
at
the
foot
of
the
patent
which
made
me
the
commander
over
men
and
material
here
are
you
not
a
french
citizen
demanded
billet
warmly
i
am
a
french
nobleman
said
the
count
of
launay
true
you
are
a
soldier
and
speak
like
one
you
are
right
said
the
gentleman
bowing
i
am
a
soldier
and
carry
out
my
orders
well
i
am
a
citizen
went
on
billet
and
as
my
duty
as
such
is
opposed
to
yours
as
the
king
soldier
one
of
us
must
die
he
who
fulfills
his
orders
or
his
duties
that
is
likely
sir
so
you
are
determined
to
fire
on
the
people
not
unless
i
am
fired
at
i
pledged
myself
to
that
effect
to
lord
provost
flesselles
deputation
you
see
the
guns
have
been
retired
but
at
the
first
shot
i
will
roll
one
say
this
one
forward
out
of
the
embrasure
with
my
own
hands
train
it
and
point
it
and
fire
with
the
you
see
there
if
i
believed
that
said
billet
before
you
could
commit
such
a
crime
i
have
told
you
that
i
am
a
soldier
and
know
nothing
outside
my
orders
then
look
said
billet
drawing
launay
to
the
gap
in
the
battlements
and
pointing
alternately
in
two
different
directions
the
main
street
from
the
town
and
the
street
through
the
suburbs
behold
those
who
will
henceforth
give
you
orders
launay
saw
two
black
dense
roaring
bodies
undulating
like
snakes
with
head
and
bodies
in
sight
but
the
rearmost
coils
still
waving
onwards
till
lost
in
the
hollows
of
the
ground
all
the
bodies
of
these
immense
reptiles
glittered
with
the
scales
these
were
the
two
armies
to
which
billet
had
given
the
bastile
as
the
marat
men
and
gonchon
beggars
as
they
surged
forward
they
brandished
their
weapons
and
yelled
cries
at
the
sight
launay
lost
color
and
said
as
he
raised
his
cane
to
your
guns
then
threatening
billet
he
added
you
scoundrel
to
come
here
and
gain
time
under
pretence
of
a
parley
do
you
know
that
you
deserve
death
billet
saw
the
attempt
to
draw
the
sword
from
the
cane
and
pierce
him
he
seized
the
speaker
by
the
collar
and
waistband
as
swift
as
lightning
and
raising
him
clear
off
the
ground
he
replied
and
you
deserve
to
be
hurled
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
ditch
to
be
smashed
in
the
mud
but
never
mind
thank
god
i
can
fight
you
in
another
manner
at
this
instant
an
immense
howl
a
universal
one
rose
in
the
air
like
a
whirlwind
as
major
losme
appeared
on
the
platform
oh
sir
for
mercy
sake
he
said
to
billet
show
yourself
for
the
people
there
believe
something
has
happened
you
and
they
call
for
you
indeed
the
name
of
billet
set
afloat
by
pitou
ascended
on
the
clamor
the
farmer
let
go
launay
who
replaced
the
blade
in
the
stick
the
three
men
hesitated
for
a
moment
while
the
innumerable
cries
of
vengeance
and
menace
arose
show
yourself
sir
said
launay
not
because
the
noise
frightens
me
but
to
prove
that
i
have
acted
fairly
the
farmer
thrust
his
head
out
of
the
porthole
waving
his
hand
at
this
sight
the
populace
burst
with
cheering
it
was
in
a
measure
revolution
standing
up
in
billet
stead
as
this
man
of
the
lowest
ranks
trod
the
bastile
turret
like
a
master
that
is
well
sir
went
on
launay
now
all
is
ended
between
us
you
have
no
further
business
here
they
ask
for
you
below
go
down
billet
appreciated
this
moderation
on
the
part
of
a
man
who
had
him
in
his
power
he
went
down
by
the
same
stairs
the
governor
following
the
major
remained
up
there
as
the
governor
had
whispered
some
orders
to
him
it
was
evident
that
count
launay
had
but
one
wish
that
the
bearer
of
the
flag
of
truce
should
be
his
active
enemy
as
soon
as
possible
without
speaking
a
word
the
envoy
crossed
the
yard
where
he
saw
the
cannoniers
were
at
their
pieces
and
the
lintstocks
were
lighted
and
smoking
he
stopped
before
them
friends
he
cried
remember
that
i
came
to
your
commander
to
stay
the
shedding
of
blood
but
that
he
refused
me
in
the
king
name
be
off
from
here
said
launay
stamping
his
foot
have
a
care
retorted
the
farmer
i
am
ordered
out
in
the
name
but
i
shall
return
in
that
of
the
people
speak
out
he
added
turning
to
the
swiss
who
are
you
for
the
foreign
soldiers
were
silent
launay
pointed
to
the
iron
door
but
billet
attempted
a
final
effort
governor
in
the
name
of
the
nation
in
the
name
of
your
brothers
brothers
is
that
what
you
call
them
who
are
bellowing
the
bastile
and
death
to
the
governor
they
may
be
brothers
of
yours
but
surely
they
are
none
of
mine
in
humanity
then
humanity
which
urges
you
to
come
a
hundred
thousand
strong
against
one
hundred
hapless
soldiers
immured
in
these
walls
and
cut
their
throats
but
by
giving
up
the
bastile
you
save
their
lives
and
i
lose
my
honor
billet
was
hushed
for
the
soldierly
argument
crushed
him
but
again
he
addressed
the
soldiers
saying
surrender
friends
while
it
is
yet
time
in
another
ten
minutes
it
will
be
too
late
i
will
have
you
shot
unless
you
are
out
of
this
instantly
thundered
launay
as
true
as
i
am
a
noble
billet
stopped
an
instant
folded
his
arms
in
token
of
defiance
and
crossing
glances
for
the
last
time
with
the
exasperated
governor
walked
forth
chapter
xii
storming
the
bastile
under
the
burning
july
sun
the
crowds
awaited
shuddering
with
fever
gonchon
men
had
joined
in
with
marat
the
suburbs
hailing
each
other
as
brothers
gonchon
was
at
the
head
of
his
patriots
but
marat
had
disappeared
the
scene
on
the
open
place
was
terrifying
on
seeing
billet
the
cheering
was
tremendous
he
is
a
brave
man
said
billet
to
gonchon
or
rather
i
should
say
he
is
stubborn
he
will
not
surrender
the
bastile
but
will
sustain
the
siege
do
you
think
he
will
hold
out
long
to
death
all
right
he
shall
have
that
but
how
many
men
will
be
killed
by
us
said
the
farmer
no
doubt
fearing
that
he
had
not
the
right
usurped
by
generals
kings
and
emperors
those
who
take
out
licenses
to
kill
and
maim
rubbish
said
gonchon
there
are
too
many
since
we
have
not
enough
for
half
the
population
is
not
that
about
the
size
of
it
boys
he
asked
of
the
bystanders
yes
yes
was
the
reply
in
sublime
abnegation
but
the
moat
queried
billet
it
need
be
filled
up
in
only
one
place
responded
the
leader
and
i
calculate
that
we
could
choke
it
up
altogether
eh
lads
the
friends
answered
unanimously
in
the
affirmative
have
it
so
said
billet
overpowered
at
this
moment
launay
appeared
on
a
terrace
followed
by
major
losme
and
two
or
three
other
officers
commence
shouted
gonchon
the
governor
turned
his
back
on
him
gonchon
might
have
put
up
with
a
threat
but
he
would
not
bear
contempt
he
lifted
his
gun
and
fired
at
him
a
man
near
him
fell
instantly
a
hundred
nay
a
thousand
gunshots
sounded
as
if
it
were
awaited
as
a
signal
and
the
grey
towers
were
striped
with
white
a
few
seconds
silence
succeeded
this
discharge
as
if
the
assailants
were
frightened
at
what
they
had
done
then
a
gush
of
flame
lost
in
a
cloud
of
smoke
crowned
the
crest
of
one
tower
a
detonation
thundered
shrieks
of
pain
were
heard
in
the
throngs
closely
pressed
the
first
cannonshot
had
been
fired
by
the
royalists
the
first
blood
shed
the
battle
between
people
and
bastile
was
begun
an
instant
previously
menacing
the
multitudes
felt
something
like
terror
by
defending
itself
with
so
little
of
its
weapons
the
bastile
seemed
impregnable
in
this
period
of
concession
the
majority
had
no
doubt
supposed
that
they
would
always
have
their
way
that
was
a
mistake
this
cannonshot
fired
into
them
gave
the
measure
of
the
titanic
work
they
had
undertaken
a
firing
of
muskets
well
aimed
from
the
platform
immediately
followed
the
fresh
silence
was
broken
by
renewed
screams
groans
and
a
few
complaints
but
nobody
thought
to
flee
and
had
the
thought
struck
any
one
he
must
have
been
ashamed
seeing
the
numbers
indeed
all
the
thoroughfares
were
streams
of
human
beings
the
square
an
immense
sea
with
each
billow
a
human
head
the
eyes
flamed
and
the
mouths
hurled
curses
in
a
trice
all
the
windows
on
the
square
were
filled
with
sharpshooters
who
fired
though
out
of
range
if
a
soldier
appeared
at
a
loophole
or
an
embrasure
a
hundred
barrels
were
leveled
at
him
and
the
hail
of
bullets
chipped
away
the
edge
of
the
stone
angle
shielding
him
but
soon
they
were
tired
of
firing
at
insensible
stone
they
wanted
the
flesh
to
aim
at
and
to
see
the
blood
spirt
everybody
shouted
ideas
of
an
assault
billet
weary
of
listening
caught
up
an
ax
from
a
carpenter
hand
and
rushed
forward
in
the
midst
of
a
shower
of
missiles
striking
down
the
men
around
him
like
a
scythe
lays
the
grain
till
he
reached
a
small
guardhouse
before
the
first
drawbridge
while
the
grapeshot
was
hurling
and
whistling
about
him
he
hacked
at
the
chains
till
down
came
the
bridge
during
the
quarter
of
an
hour
that
this
insane
enterprise
went
on
the
held
their
breath
at
each
volley
they
expected
to
see
their
champion
laid
low
forgetting
their
own
danger
they
thought
solely
of
that
the
audacious
worker
ran
when
the
drop
came
down
they
uttered
a
loud
whoop
and
dashed
into
the
first
yard
the
rush
was
so
unexpected
rapid
and
impetuous
that
no
resistance
was
made
the
frenziedly
joyful
cheers
announced
the
first
advantage
to
launay
nobody
noticed
that
a
man
had
been
mangled
under
the
bridge
then
as
if
at
the
depth
of
a
cavern
the
four
guns
pointed
out
to
billet
by
the
governor
were
shot
off
with
a
dreadful
crash
and
all
the
outer
yard
was
swept
clear
the
iron
hurricane
cleft
a
long
swath
of
blood
through
the
mass
on
the
path
lay
ten
or
twelve
dead
and
double
as
many
wounded
billet
had
stood
on
the
guardhouse
roof
to
reach
the
chain
well
up
he
slid
down
where
he
found
pitou
who
had
reached
the
spot
he
knew
not
how
the
young
man
had
a
quick
eye
a
poacher
habit
he
had
seen
the
gunners
step
up
to
the
touchhole
with
the
lighted
matches
and
seizing
his
patron
by
the
coat
he
had
pulled
him
back
behind
a
corner
of
the
wall
which
sheltered
both
from
the
cannonade
from
this
period
on
the
war
was
real
the
tumult
was
alarming
the
onslaught
murderous
ten
thousand
gunshots
poured
upon
the
fort
at
risk
of
slaying
the
assaulters
with
the
garrison
to
cap
all
a
brought
up
by
the
french
guardsmen
added
its
boom
to
the
cracking
of
small
arms
the
frightful
uproar
intoxicated
the
amateur
fighters
and
began
to
daunt
the
besieged
who
felt
that
they
could
never
raise
a
commotion
equal
to
this
deafening
them
the
officers
saw
that
their
soldiers
were
weakening
they
had
to
snatch
their
muskets
from
them
and
fire
themselves
at
this
juncture
amid
the
roar
of
great
guns
and
smaller
ones
and
the
shouting
as
the
mob
were
rushing
forward
to
carry
away
the
injured
and
dead
on
litters
a
little
body
of
citizens
appeared
calm
and
unarmed
at
the
yard
entrance
it
was
a
deputation
of
electors
from
the
city
hall
they
were
sacrificing
life
under
protection
merely
of
the
white
flag
before
and
after
them
to
indicate
they
came
to
parley
wishing
to
stop
the
effusion
of
blood
after
hearing
that
the
attack
had
commenced
they
forced
flesselles
to
renew
negotiations
with
the
governor
in
the
name
of
the
city
they
summoned
the
governor
of
the
citadel
to
cease
firing
and
to
receive
in
the
place
a
hundred
of
the
town
guards
to
guarantee
his
safety
the
garrison
and
the
inhabitants
the
deputies
called
this
out
as
they
marched
along
frightened
by
the
magnitude
of
the
task
they
had
set
themselves
the
people
were
ready
to
accept
the
proposal
seeing
too
the
dead
and
wounded
carried
by
if
launay
accepted
the
partial
defeat
they
would
be
content
with
a
at
sight
of
them
the
firing
ceased
they
were
beckoned
to
approach
and
they
scrambled
over
the
corpses
slipped
in
gore
and
held
their
hands
out
to
the
maimed
under
their
shelter
the
others
grouped
the
injured
and
lifeless
were
borne
out
streaking
the
marble
flags
with
broad
purple
stains
firing
ceasing
on
the
fort
side
billet
went
out
to
get
his
party
to
refrain
at
the
doors
he
met
gonchon
without
arms
exposing
his
naked
breast
like
a
man
inspired
calm
as
though
invulnerable
what
has
become
of
the
deputation
he
inquired
it
has
got
in
replied
billet
cease
firing
it
is
useless
he
will
not
give
in
said
the
beggar
leader
with
the
same
certainty
as
if
he
had
been
gifted
with
reading
the
future
no
matter
respect
the
usages
of
war
since
we
have
become
soldiers
i
do
not
mind
said
gonchon
elie
hullin
go
he
said
to
two
men
who
seemed
to
rule
the
crowd
together
with
him
do
not
let
a
shot
be
fired
till
i
say
so
at
the
voice
the
two
darted
away
cleaving
the
throng
and
soon
the
sound
of
the
musketry
dying
away
stopped
entirely
during
the
short
rest
the
wounded
were
attended
to
they
were
upwards
of
forty
two
struck
they
had
been
hammering
away
two
hours
from
noon
billet
had
returned
to
the
front
where
gonchon
found
him
his
impatience
was
visible
as
he
watched
the
iron
grating
what
is
wrong
asked
the
farmer
all
is
lost
if
the
bastile
is
not
taken
in
two
hours
was
the
beggar
reply
how
so
because
the
royal
court
will
learn
what
we
are
at
it
will
send
us
bezenval
switzers
and
lambesq
heavies
who
will
help
catch
us
between
three
fires
billet
was
forced
to
confess
the
truth
in
the
prospect
at
length
the
deputies
appeared
by
their
aspect
it
was
clear
their
errand
had
failed
what
did
i
tell
you
cried
the
popular
orator
gladly
what
was
foretold
by
balsamo
and
cagliostro
will
come
to
pass
the
accursed
fortress
is
doomed
to
arms
boys
to
arms
he
yelled
without
waiting
for
the
deputies
to
relate
their
doings
the
commandment
refuses
in
fact
scarcely
had
the
governor
read
flesselles
letter
introducing
the
party
than
he
brightened
up
in
the
face
and
exclaimed
instead
of
yielding
to
the
proposition
you
parisian
gentlemen
wanted
the
fight
and
it
is
too
late
to
draw
back
the
citizens
had
protested
and
persisted
in
picturing
the
horrors
which
the
defense
would
entail
but
he
would
heed
nothing
and
finishing
by
saying
to
them
what
he
had
told
billet
a
couple
of
hours
anteriorly
begone
or
i
will
have
you
shot
the
citizens
were
glad
to
get
out
of
it
launay
took
the
offensive
this
time
he
was
wild
with
impatience
before
the
deputation
crossed
the
threshold
the
sackbut
of
marshal
saxe
played
its
tune
three
men
fell
one
dead
and
two
wounded
the
latter
being
a
french
guardsman
and
the
other
one
of
the
bearers
at
sight
of
this
victim
whose
errand
made
him
sacred
carried
away
smothered
in
blood
the
fury
of
the
numbers
was
exalted
once
more
gonchon
had
returned
to
take
their
places
by
his
side
but
each
had
run
home
to
change
his
dress
elie
had
been
the
marquis
conflans
and
his
livery
resembled
a
hungarian
officer
uniform
elie
put
on
the
uniform
he
had
worn
when
an
officer
of
the
queen
own
regiment
and
this
gave
more
confidence
to
the
masses
with
the
thought
that
the
army
was
on
their
side
the
firing
recommenced
more
fiercely
than
before
at
this
major
losme
approached
his
superior
he
was
a
brave
and
honorable
soldier
but
he
had
some
manhood
left
him
and
he
saw
with
pain
what
had
happened
and
foresaw
with
more
pain
what
would
occur
you
know
we
have
no
food
he
said
i
know
that
answered
launay
and
we
have
no
order
to
hold
out
i
ask
your
pardon
military
governor
of
the
bastile
but
i
am
the
governor
of
it
in
all
respects
my
order
is
to
shut
the
doors
and
i
hold
the
keys
my
lord
keys
are
to
open
locks
as
well
as
fasten
them
have
a
care
that
you
do
not
get
the
garrison
massacred
without
saving
the
castle
that
will
be
two
triumphs
for
the
revolters
in
one
day
look
at
the
men
we
kill
they
spring
up
again
from
the
pavement
this
morning
only
three
thousand
were
there
three
hours
ago
there
were
six
now
they
are
over
sixty
thousand
and
they
will
number
a
hundred
thousand
when
our
cannon
are
silenced
and
that
will
be
the
upshot
they
will
be
strong
enough
to
pull
down
the
bastile
with
their
bare
hands
you
do
not
speak
like
the
military
governor
of
the
bastile
major
losme
i
speak
like
a
frenchman
my
lord
i
say
that
his
majesty
having
given
us
no
special
order
and
the
provost
of
the
traders
having
made
us
a
very
acceptable
proposition
to
introduce
a
hundred
civil
guards
into
the
castle
you
might
avoid
the
misery
i
foresee
by
acceding
to
provost
flesselles
proposition
in
your
opinion
the
city
of
paris
is
a
power
we
ought
to
obey
yes
in
the
absence
of
special
royal
order
then
read
major
losme
said
the
prison
chief
leading
his
lieutenant
aside
into
a
corner
on
the
small
sheet
of
paper
which
he
let
him
read
was
written
hold
out
firmly
i
will
amuse
the
parisians
with
cockades
and
promises
before
day
is
done
bezenval
will
send
you
reinforcements
flesselles
how
did
this
advice
reach
you
inquired
the
major
in
the
letter
the
deputies
carried
they
thought
they
were
bearing
a
desire
for
the
bastile
to
be
surrendered
and
it
was
the
order
to
defend
it
that
they
handed
me
the
major
bent
his
head
go
to
your
post
and
do
not
quit
it
till
i
command
you
sir
continued
launay
losme
obeying
he
coldly
folded
up
the
paper
replaced
it
in
his
pocket
and
went
over
to
the
cannoniers
to
advise
them
to
aim
true
and
fire
low
they
obeyed
like
the
major
but
the
fortalice
fate
was
settled
no
human
power
could
delay
the
accomplishment
to
every
cannonshot
the
reply
was
we
mean
to
have
the
bastile
while
voices
claimed
it
arms
were
not
idle
pitou
and
billet
arms
and
voices
were
among
those
asking
most
energetically
and
working
most
efficaciously
each
worked
according
to
his
character
courageous
and
confident
as
the
bulldog
billet
had
run
at
the
enemy
heedless
of
shot
and
steel
pitou
prudent
and
circumspect
as
the
fox
endowed
to
the
highest
degree
with
utilized
all
his
faculties
to
watch
danger
and
anticipate
it
his
sight
knew
the
most
deadly
embrasures
and
distinguished
the
least
move
of
the
bronze
tube
to
enter
it
he
could
guess
the
exact
moment
when
the
was
about
to
fire
through
the
portcullis
his
eyes
having
done
their
office
he
made
his
limbs
work
for
their
owner
down
went
his
shoulders
and
in
went
his
chest
so
that
his
frame
offered
no
more
surface
than
a
board
seen
edgewise
in
these
moments
of
the
pitou
thin
only
in
the
legs
nothing
remained
but
the
geometrical
expression
of
a
straight
line
he
chose
a
spot
where
the
masonry
shaped
out
cavities
and
projections
so
that
his
head
was
shielded
by
a
stone
his
heart
by
another
and
his
knees
by
still
another
slab
nowhere
could
a
mortal
wound
be
got
in
on
him
he
fired
a
shot
now
and
then
to
relieve
his
feelings
and
because
billet
told
him
to
blaze
away
but
he
had
nothing
but
wood
and
stone
before
him
for
his
part
he
kept
begging
his
friend
not
to
expose
himself
to
the
firing
there
goes
the
sackbut
or
i
hear
a
hammer
coming
down
despite
these
injunctions
the
farmer
executed
prodigies
of
daring
and
energy
all
in
pure
waste
till
the
idea
struck
him
to
go
along
the
woodwork
of
the
bridge
and
chop
the
chains
of
the
second
one
as
he
had
done
with
the
first
ange
howled
for
him
to
stay
and
seeing
that
howls
were
useless
he
followed
him
from
cover
saying
dear
master
billet
your
wife
will
be
a
widow
if
you
get
killed
the
swiss
thrust
their
guns
through
the
loopholes
by
which
the
sackbut
was
fired
to
try
to
pick
off
the
daring
fellow
who
was
making
the
chips
fly
off
their
bridge
billet
called
on
his
single
gun
to
answer
the
sackbut
but
when
the
latter
fired
the
other
artillerists
retreated
and
the
farmer
was
left
alone
to
serve
the
cannon
this
again
drew
pitou
out
of
his
refuge
master
he
sued
in
the
name
of
catherine
think
if
you
are
done
for
that
catherine
will
be
an
orphan
billet
yielded
to
his
plea
and
because
he
had
a
new
idea
he
ran
out
on
the
square
holloaing
a
cart
two
carts
added
pitou
thinking
you
can
not
have
too
much
of
a
good
thing
ten
carts
were
immediately
trundled
through
the
multitude
dry
hay
and
straw
shouted
billet
straw
and
hay
repeated
pitou
like
a
flash
two
hundred
men
brought
each
a
truss
of
straw
or
half
a
bale
of
hay
others
brought
dry
fodder
on
litters
they
were
obliged
to
call
out
that
they
had
ten
times
more
than
was
wanted
in
an
hour
they
would
have
smothered
the
bastile
billet
put
himself
in
the
rails
of
a
laden
with
hay
and
pushed
it
before
him
instead
of
dragging
it
pitou
did
the
same
with
another
without
knowing
why
but
thinking
the
farmer
example
was
worthy
of
imitation
elie
and
hullin
guessed
what
the
farmer
proposed
they
supplied
themselves
with
carts
and
pushed
them
into
the
prison
yard
scarcely
did
they
enter
than
small
shot
and
canister
received
them
but
the
hay
and
straw
deadened
the
bullets
and
slugs
and
only
a
few
rattled
on
the
wheels
and
shafts
none
of
the
assailants
were
touched
as
soon
as
this
discharge
was
fired
two
or
three
hundred
musketmen
dashed
on
behind
the
and
lodged
under
the
sloping
shed
of
the
bridge
itself
under
cover
of
the
moving
breastwork
there
billet
pulled
out
a
scrap
of
paper
and
flint
and
steel
he
wrapped
up
a
pinch
of
gunpowder
in
the
paper
struck
a
light
and
ignited
it
and
shoved
the
flaring
piece
into
the
heap
of
hay
others
took
lighted
wisps
and
scattered
the
flames
it
caught
the
pentroof
and
the
four
blazing
carts
set
fire
to
beams
high
up
and
sneaked
along
the
bridge
supports
to
put
out
the
fire
the
garrison
would
have
to
come
out
and
to
show
oneself
was
to
court
death
the
glad
cheer
started
in
the
yard
was
caught
up
on
the
square
where
the
smoke
was
seen
above
the
towers
something
fatal
to
the
besieged
was
surmised
to
be
going
on
indeed
the
redhot
chains
drew
out
and
snapped
from
the
ringbolts
the
bridge
fell
smoking
and
sending
up
sparks
the
firemen
came
up
with
their
engines
but
the
governor
ordered
them
to
be
fired
upon
though
the
prison
might
be
thus
burned
over
the
garrison
heads
the
old
french
soldiers
refused
the
swiss
were
willing
but
as
they
were
not
artillerists
they
could
not
work
the
these
had
to
be
abandoned
on
the
other
side
seeing
that
the
cannonade
ceased
the
french
guards
resumed
their
work
and
with
the
third
ball
sent
the
portcullis
flying
the
governor
had
gone
upon
the
tower
to
see
if
the
promised
succor
was
arriving
when
he
suddenly
found
himself
enwrapped
in
smoke
he
ran
downstairs
and
ordered
the
gunners
to
keep
up
the
firing
the
refusal
of
the
french
veterans
exasperated
him
on
hearing
the
portcullis
smashed
in
he
recognized
that
all
was
lost
he
was
fully
aware
that
he
was
hated
he
guessed
that
there
was
no
safety
for
him
during
the
whole
of
the
action
he
had
cherished
the
thought
of
burying
himself
under
the
ruins
of
his
castle
as
soon
as
he
acknowledged
that
all
resistance
was
useless
he
snatched
a
lintstock
from
an
artillerist
and
precipitated
himself
towards
the
powder
magazine
the
powder
the
powder
shrieked
twenty
terrified
voices
on
seeing
the
governor
with
the
burning
match
they
divined
his
intention
two
soldiers
crossed
their
bayonets
before
his
breast
at
the
very
instant
when
he
opened
the
door
you
may
kill
me
he
said
but
you
can
not
do
that
so
quickly
that
i
shall
not
have
had
time
to
toss
this
brand
into
one
of
the
open
kegs
then
all
of
us
besieged
and
besiegers
go
up
the
soldiers
stopped
with
the
steel
at
his
breast
but
he
was
still
their
commander
and
commanded
for
he
held
the
lives
of
all
in
his
hands
his
movement
rivetted
everybody
to
their
place
the
assailants
perceived
that
something
extraordinary
was
going
on
they
peered
into
the
yard
and
saw
the
governor
threatening
and
being
threatened
hark
to
me
said
he
as
true
as
i
have
death
in
my
grasp
for
all
of
you
i
will
fire
the
powder
if
one
of
you
dare
step
within
this
yard
the
hearers
might
fancy
the
earth
quaked
beneath
their
feet
what
do
you
want
several
voices
gasped
with
the
accent
of
a
panic
an
honorable
capitulation
as
the
assailants
could
not
fully
comprehend
the
extent
of
despair
and
did
not
believe
his
speech
they
began
to
enter
billet
at
the
head
but
he
suddenly
turned
pale
and
trembled
for
he
had
thought
of
gilbert
it
little
mattered
to
the
farmer
whether
the
bastile
was
torn
down
or
blown
up
but
at
any
price
the
must
live
the
pupil
of
balsamo
his
successor
perhaps
at
the
head
of
the
invisibles
stop
shouted
billet
for
the
sake
of
the
prisoners
elie
and
hullin
and
their
men
who
had
not
shrank
from
death
on
their
own
behalf
recoiled
white
and
trembling
like
he
had
what
do
you
want
they
demanded
of
the
governor
renewing
the
question
his
garrison
had
put
to
him
everybody
must
retire
replied
count
launay
i
will
listen
to
no
proposition
while
there
is
an
intruder
inside
the
bastile
walls
but
you
will
take
advantage
of
our
withdrawal
to
repair
damages
remonstrated
billet
if
the
capitulation
be
refused
you
will
find
things
in
the
same
condition
you
there
i
at
this
door
on
the
faith
of
a
nobleman
some
shook
their
heads
is
there
any
here
who
doubt
a
nobleman
questioned
the
count
no
no
nobody
rejoined
five
hundred
voices
bring
me
pen
ink
and
paper
continued
the
governor
that
is
well
he
went
on
as
his
orders
were
executed
now
retire
he
said
to
the
assaulters
billet
elie
and
hullin
set
the
example
and
all
followed
them
launay
laid
the
match
by
his
side
and
began
to
write
the
terms
of
surrender
on
his
knee
the
french
veterans
and
the
swiss
aware
that
their
safety
was
at
stake
silently
looked
at
him
in
superstitious
terror
when
he
turned
before
writing
the
document
out
fair
all
the
yards
were
clear
in
a
twinkling
all
the
concourse
outside
had
learnt
what
was
proceeding
as
losme
had
said
it
was
the
population
which
issued
from
beneath
the
flagstones
and
pavement
not
only
workmen
and
beggars
the
homeless
and
the
imperfectly
clad
but
citizens
of
the
better
classes
not
only
men
but
women
and
children
each
had
a
weapon
and
uttered
a
from
spot
to
spot
amid
groups
was
seen
a
woman
disheveled
wringing
her
hands
and
waving
her
arms
howling
curses
at
the
giant
of
stone
it
was
a
mother
a
wife
or
a
sweetheart
whose
dearest
one
had
been
incarcerated
in
its
flanks
but
since
a
short
space
the
giant
had
ceased
to
vomit
flame
and
scowl
in
the
smoke
the
fire
was
extinct
and
the
whole
mute
as
a
tomb
on
the
blackened
walls
the
bullet
grazes
stood
out
white
and
were
above
count
everybody
had
wanted
to
leave
his
mark
on
the
granite
brow
of
his
personification
of
tyranny
they
could
hardly
believe
that
the
bastile
was
about
to
be
turned
over
to
them
that
its
governor
would
surrender
in
the
midst
of
this
general
doubt
as
none
ventured
to
congratulate
another
and
all
waited
in
silence
a
letter
stuck
on
a
spearpoint
was
seen
thrust
through
a
loophole
between
the
despatch
and
the
besiegers
was
the
great
moat
deep
and
wide
and
full
of
water
billet
called
for
a
plank
but
three
were
too
short
and
the
fourth
while
long
enough
was
ill
adjusted
still
he
balanced
himself
as
well
as
he
could
and
unhesitatingly
risked
himself
on
the
bending
bridge
all
in
dumbness
fixed
their
eyes
on
the
man
who
seemed
suspended
over
the
stagnant
water
while
pitou
quivering
sat
on
the
brink
and
hid
his
face
all
of
a
sudden
when
billet
was
over
the
plank
shifted
and
throwing
up
his
arms
he
fell
in
the
moat
where
he
sank
out
of
sight
pitou
uttered
a
roar
and
dived
after
his
master
like
a
newfoundland
dog
a
man
went
right
out
on
the
plank
without
hesitation
choosing
the
same
road
as
billet
it
was
stanislas
maillard
the
prison
clerk
on
reaching
the
point
beneath
which
he
saw
two
men
struggling
he
looked
but
seeing
that
they
could
swim
ashore
he
continued
his
way
in
half
a
minute
he
was
across
and
took
the
letter
off
the
pike
with
the
same
tranquil
nerve
and
steadiness
of
gait
he
passed
back
over
the
plank
but
at
the
very
second
when
all
crowded
round
him
to
read
the
message
a
hail
of
bullets
rained
down
from
the
battlements
at
the
same
time
as
a
tremendous
report
was
heard
from
all
breasts
a
cry
arose
one
announcing
that
the
people
meant
to
have
revenge
trust
the
tyrants
again
said
gonchon
nobody
cared
any
more
about
capitulations
the
powder
the
prisoners
or
himself
nothing
was
wanted
but
retaliation
and
the
besiegers
strewed
into
the
yards
not
by
hundreds
but
by
thousands
the
only
thing
preventing
them
entering
still
faster
was
not
the
muskets
but
the
narrowness
of
the
doorways
on
hearing
the
firing
the
two
soldiers
who
had
not
gone
away
from
their
commander
jumped
at
him
and
a
third
set
his
foot
on
the
and
crushed
it
out
launay
drew
the
sword
hidden
in
his
cane
and
tried
to
stab
with
it
but
it
was
wrenched
off
from
him
and
broken
while
in
his
grip
he
was
convinced
that
he
could
do
no
more
and
he
waited
for
his
doom
the
mobs
rushing
in
met
the
soldiers
holding
out
their
hands
to
them
and
so
the
bastile
was
not
taken
under
a
surrender
but
by
assault
this
came
from
the
royal
castle
having
ceased
to
enclose
inert
matter
latterly
the
king
had
shut
up
human
brain
there
and
the
spirit
had
burst
the
vessel
the
people
entered
at
the
breach
as
for
the
treacherous
volley
fired
in
the
midst
of
silence
during
the
suspension
of
hostilities
and
unforeseen
impolitic
and
deadly
aggression
it
will
never
be
known
who
gave
the
order
inspired
it
and
accomplished
it
there
are
moments
when
the
future
of
a
nation
is
exactly
poised
in
the
scales
of
fate
one
of
the
plates
bears
up
the
other
even
while
each
party
thinks
his
side
will
make
the
other
kick
the
beam
an
invisible
hand
has
flung
into
the
dish
a
dagger
or
a
pistol
and
all
changes
the
only
cry
heard
is
woe
to
the
vanquished
chapter
xiii
down
in
the
dungeons
while
the
multitude
poured
roaring
with
delight
and
anger
at
the
same
time
into
the
yards
of
the
prison
two
men
were
floundering
in
the
ditch
billet
and
pitou
the
latter
was
keeping
up
the
other
whom
no
bullet
or
blow
had
struck
but
the
fall
had
a
trifle
stunned
him
ropes
were
thrown
to
them
and
poles
thrust
down
in
five
minutes
they
were
rescued
and
were
hugged
and
carried
in
triumph
muddy
though
they
were
one
gave
billet
a
drink
of
brandy
another
crammed
the
younger
peasant
with
bread
and
sausage
a
third
dried
them
off
and
led
them
into
the
sunshine
suddenly
an
idea
or
rather
a
memory
crossed
the
good
farmer
mind
he
tore
himself
from
the
friendly
arms
and
ran
towards
the
fort
the
prisoners
help
the
prisoners
he
shouted
yes
the
prisoners
repeated
pitou
darting
into
the
tower
after
his
leader
only
thinking
of
the
jailers
the
mob
now
shuddered
on
remembering
the
captives
the
cries
were
reiterated
a
fresh
flood
of
assailants
burst
any
remaining
barriers
and
seemed
to
enlarge
the
flanks
of
the
prison
to
expand
it
with
liberty
a
frightful
scene
was
presented
to
billet
and
his
friend
the
mob
crowded
into
the
court
enraged
drunken
and
furious
the
first
soldier
falling
under
hand
was
torn
to
pieces
gonchon
looked
on
quietly
no
doubt
thinking
that
popular
wrath
is
like
a
great
river
doing
more
mischief
if
one
tries
to
dam
it
than
if
letting
it
make
its
course
on
the
contrary
elie
and
hullin
leaped
in
between
defenders
and
attackers
they
prayed
and
supplicated
vociferating
the
holy
lie
that
the
soldiers
were
promised
their
lives
billet
and
pitou
arrival
was
reinforcement
to
them
billet
whom
they
were
revenging
was
alive
not
even
hurt
the
plank
had
swerved
underfoot
and
he
was
clear
with
a
mud
bath
that
was
all
the
swiss
were
most
detested
but
they
were
not
to
be
found
they
had
time
to
put
on
overalls
and
smockfrocks
of
dull
linen
and
they
passed
off
as
servants
with
sledges
the
invaders
broke
the
captive
images
on
the
clock
face
they
raced
up
to
the
turret
tops
to
kick
the
cannon
which
had
belched
death
on
them
they
laid
hands
on
the
stones
and
endeavored
to
dislodge
them
when
the
first
of
the
conquerors
were
seen
on
the
battlements
all
without
below
a
hundred
thousand
or
so
cast
up
an
immense
clamor
it
spread
over
paris
and
flew
over
france
like
a
swiftwinged
eagle
the
bastile
is
taken
at
this
news
hearts
melted
eyes
were
moist
with
tears
of
gladness
and
hands
clasped
no
longer
were
there
opposition
parties
or
inimical
castes
for
all
parisians
understood
that
they
were
brothers
and
all
men
that
they
were
free
a
million
of
men
mutually
embraced
billet
and
pitou
wanted
no
part
in
the
rejoicing
they
sought
the
liberation
of
the
prisoners
traversing
government
yard
they
passed
near
a
man
in
grey
clothes
calmly
leaning
on
a
cane
it
was
the
governor
quietly
waiting
for
his
friends
to
save
him
or
his
foes
to
lay
him
low
billet
recognized
him
at
sight
and
uttered
an
outcry
he
walked
straight
up
to
him
launay
knew
him
again
also
but
folded
his
arms
and
looked
at
billet
as
much
as
to
say
is
it
you
who
will
deal
me
the
first
stab
if
i
speak
to
him
thought
the
farmer
they
will
know
him
and
then
he
will
be
killed
yet
how
would
he
find
gilbert
in
this
chaos
how
wrest
from
the
bastile
the
grim
secret
enshrouded
in
its
womb
launay
understood
all
this
heroic
hesitation
and
scruple
what
do
you
want
asked
he
in
an
undertone
nothing
rejoined
billet
pointing
out
that
the
doorways
are
doorless
all
the
way
to
the
street
nothing
but
i
should
like
to
find
dr
gilbert
no
three
bertaudiere
tower
replied
the
count
in
a
gentle
voice
almost
softened
but
he
would
not
flee
at
this
juncture
a
voice
behind
billet
pronounced
these
words
halloa
here
is
the
governor
the
voice
was
as
emotionless
as
though
spoken
by
no
being
of
this
world
but
every
syllable
was
a
cruelly
dug
into
launay
bosom
the
voice
was
gonchon
at
the
denunciation
as
if
from
an
alarm
bell
ringing
all
the
men
athirst
for
vengeance
started
and
turned
their
flaring
eyes
on
launay
at
whom
they
flung
themselves
he
is
lost
unless
we
can
save
him
said
billet
to
elie
and
hullin
help
us
they
answered
i
must
stay
here
as
i
have
a
task
to
do
in
a
flash
launay
was
taken
up
by
numerous
hands
and
carried
out
elie
and
his
comrade
hurried
after
calling
stop
he
was
promised
his
life
for
surrendering
this
was
not
true
but
the
sublime
falsehood
rushed
from
both
of
the
noble
hearts
in
a
second
the
governor
followed
by
the
pair
disappeared
in
the
corridor
opening
on
the
square
amid
shouts
take
him
to
the
city
hall
as
a
living
prey
launay
was
in
the
eyes
of
most
equal
to
the
dead
prey
the
prison
overrun
strange
was
the
sight
of
this
sad
and
silent
edifice
for
four
centuries
threaded
solely
by
the
warden
and
his
turnkeys
become
the
strolling
ground
of
any
tatterdemalion
the
crowd
roamed
over
the
garden
up
and
down
the
stairs
buzzing
like
a
swarm
of
bees
and
filling
the
granite
hive
with
bustle
and
uproar
billet
for
an
instant
watched
launay
carried
rather
than
dragged
seeming
to
hover
over
the
multitude
but
he
was
gone
in
a
space
billet
sighed
and
looking
round
him
and
seeing
pitou
said
as
he
darted
towards
a
tower
the
third
bertaudiere
a
trembling
jailer
was
in
the
way
here

answered
but

we

grasping

into

conducted
by

stopped
before

days
ago

rejoined
the
farmer
attacking
the
door
with
the
ax
it
was
of
oak
but
the
splinters
flew
freely
under
the
chops
of
the
vigorous
yeoman
in
a
short
time
one
could
peep
into
the
room
billet
looked
in
at
the
cleft
in
the
beam
of
light
from
a
grated
window
in
the
yard
a
man
was
visible
in
the
cell
standing
a
little
back
holding
one
of
his
bedslates
he
was
in
the
attitude
of
defense
ready
to
knock
down
any
one
intruding
spite
of
his
long
beard
pale
face
and
his
hair
being
close
cropped
billet
recognized
gilbert
doctor
doctor
is
it
you
it
is
billet
who
calls
your
friend
are
you
here
billet
here
yes
yes
that
billet
right
here
shouted
the
crowd
we
are
here
in
the
bastile
for
we
have
taken
it
you
are
free
the
bastile
is
taken
and
i
am
free
repeated
the
doctor
running
both
hands
through
the
bars
of
the
door
he
shook
it
so
forcibly
that
the
hinges
and
seemed
likely
to
shoot
out
of
the
pockets
one
of
the
split
panels
shattered
by
billet
fell
clean
out
and
was
left
in
the
prisoner
hands
wait
wait
said
the
rescuer
seeing
that
such
another
exertion
would
exhaust
the
man
powers
too
much
excited
wait
he
redoubled
his
blows
through
the
gap
the
prisoner
could
be
seen
fallen
on
his
stool
pale
as
a
sceptre
and
incapable
of
moving
the
broken
beam
again
with
which
he
had
tried
like
a
samson
to
shake
the
bastile
down
billet
he
kept
on
saying
and
me
with
him
doctor
poor
pitou
whom
you
must
remember
from
having
placed
me
for
board
and
lodging
at
aunt
angelique
i
came
along
to
get
you
out
but
i
can
not
get
through
that
crack
objected
the
prisoner
we
will
widen
it
cried
the
bystanders
in
a
common
effort
each
brought
his
effort
to
bear
while
one
inserted
a
crowbar
between
the
wall
and
the
another
got
a
purchase
on
the
lock
with
the
lever
and
others
put
their
shoulders
to
the
woodwork
the
oak
gave
a
last
crack
and
the
stones
scaled
off
so
that
by
the
removed
door
and
the
crumbling
stone
the
torrent
plunged
within
the
prison
gilbert
was
soon
in
the
arms
of
his
friends
gilbert
who
was
a
little
peasant
boy
on
the
taverney
estate
where
he
conceived
an
undying
and
passion
for
his
daughter
andrea
was
now
a
man
of
philip
of
taverney
who
tried
to
kill
him
in
a
cave
in
the
azores
islands
because
he
had
accomplished
the
of
his
existence
in
giving
andrea
the
title
of
mother
to
little
sebastian
gilbert
would
not
recognize
him
he
left
bathed
in
blood
pale
without
sickliness
with
black
hair
and
steady
though
animated
eyes
one
could
tell
that
he
like
his
teacher
was
endowed
with
the
power
of
magnetism
as
he
could
now
mesmerize
andrea
he
could
mentally
master
most
men
when
his
gaze
was
idle
it
did
not
wander
in
vacancy
but
retired
into
his
meditations
and
became
the
gloomier
and
deeper
his
nose
was
straight
coming
down
from
the
brow
in
a
direct
line
it
surmounted
a
disdainful
lip
showing
the
dazzling
enamel
of
his
teeth
commonly
he
was
clad
with
simplicity
but
it
approached
elegance
from
its
extreme
primness
his
stature
above
the
middle
height
was
well
formed
and
we
have
seen
how
strong
he
could
be
when
he
roused
all
his
nervous
force
although
a
week
in
jail
he
had
taken
the
usual
care
of
himself
though
his
beard
had
grown
long
it
was
combed
out
and
set
off
his
clear
skin
indicating
by
its
length
not
his
neglect
but
the
refusal
of
a
razor
or
a
shave
after
thanking
billet
and
pitou
he
turned
to
the
crowd
in
the
cell
as
if
he
recovered
all
his
command
in
a
twinkling
he
said
then
the
long
day
has
come
i
thank
you
all
my
friends
and
i
thank
the
eternal
spirit
which
watches
over
the
liberty
of
peoples
he
held
out
his
hands
but
they
shrank
from
touching
them
so
lofty
was
his
glance
and
his
voice
so
dignified
as
of
a
superior
man
leaving
the
dungeon
he
walked
out
before
them
all
leaning
on
the
farmer
and
the
country
boy
after
gilbert
first
impulse
of
gratitude
and
friendship
a
second
had
established
the
first
distance
between
him
and
the
subordinates
at
the
door
gilbert
stopped
dazzled
by
the
sunshine
he
stopped
folded
his
arms
and
said
as
he
gazed
upwards
hail
beautiful
liberty
i
saw
you
spring
into
life
in
the
new
world
and
we
are
old
friends
and
battlefield
comrades
hail
the
smile
he
wore
showed
that
the
cheers
of
a
free
people
were
not
a
novelty
to
him
billet
he
said
after
collecting
his
thoughts
have
the
people
overcome
despotism
they
have
and
you
came
to
liberate
me
how
did
you
know
of
my
arrest
your
son
told
me
this
morning
poor
have
you
seen
him
is
he
at
peace
in
the
school
i
left
him
being
carried
to
the
sick
ward
as
he
had
a
fit
he
was
wild
because
we
would
not
let
him
have
a
share
in
the
fighting
to
get
you
out
the
physician
smiled
for
the
boy
was
his
hope
and
had
borne
himself
as
he
hoped
i
said
that
as
you
were
in
the
bastile
we
would
have
to
take
the
bastile
went
on
the
farmer
and
now
we
have
taken
it
but
that
is
not
all
the
casket
is
stolen
which
you
entrusted
to
me
stolen
by
whom
by
men
wearing
black
who
broke
into
the
house
under
guise
of
seizing
the
pamphlet
which
you
sent
me
locking
me
up
in
a
room
they
searched
the
whole
house
and
found
the
casket
yesterday
then
there
is
a
coincidence
between
my
arrest
and
this
purloining
the
same
person
caused
this
arrest
and
abstraction
i
must
know
whom
where
are
the
books
of
the
jail
demanded
the
doctor
turning
round
to
the
jailer
who
kept
close
in
government
yard
replied
he
oh
master
let
me
go
with
you
or
say
a
good
word
to
these
gentlemen
who
will
otherwise
knock
me
about
just
so
replied
gilbert
friends
i
want
you
not
to
do
any
harm
to
this
poor
fellow
who
only
did
his
duty
in
opening
doors
and
locking
them
he
was
always
gentle
with
the
prisoners
good
cried
the
voices
all
round
as
they
surrounded
him
in
respect
mingled
with
curiosity
he
need
not
be
scared
but
can
come
along
thank
you
sir
said
the
jailer
but
we
had
better
make
haste
for
they
are
burning
the
papers
then
there
is
not
an
instant
to
be
lost
cried
the
physician
to
the
archives
he
darted
off
towards
the
office
drawing
the
mob
with
him
at
the
head
of
which
still
marched
billet
and
pitou
chapter
xiv
the
triangle
of
liberty
at
the
door
of
the
register
hall
they
had
made
a
bonfire
of
the
documents
one
of
the
first
feelings
of
the
masses
after
a
victory
is
for
destruction
unfortunately
the
memorials
of
the
prison
were
turned
out
of
the
large
room
where
the
records
of
all
the
prisoners
since
a
hundred
years
back
were
kept
higgledy
piggledy
the
mob
shut
up
the
papers
with
anger
seeming
to
think
that
they
gave
the
prisoners
freedom
by
annulling
the
warrants
gilbert
assisted
by
pitou
looked
at
the
registers
but
the
present
year
was
missing
though
a
calm
and
cool
man
the
doctor
stamped
his
foot
with
impatience
while
he
turned
blanched
at
this
pitou
spied
a
boy
such
a
little
hero
as
always
pops
up
in
the
reign
of
king
mob
who
was
carrying
on
his
head
the
volume
to
throw
it
into
the
fire
with
his
long
legs
he
soon
overtook
him
it
was
the
register
for
the
deal
did
not
take
long
for
ange
announced
himself
as
one
who
had
captured
the
place
and
explained
that
a
prisoner
wanted
the
book
the
boy
gave
it
up
with
the
comforting
remark
that
there
were
lots
more
where
it
came
from
pitou
opened
the
book
and
on
the
last
page
he
saw
the
entry
this
day
ninth
of
july
enters
gilbert
a
most
dangerous
writer
of
public
matters
and
philosophy
keep
in
solitary
confinement
he
carried
the
register
to
the
physician
it
was
of
course
what
he
sought
looking
whence
the
order
emanated
he
exclaimed
the
warrant
to
arrest
me
signed
by
my
friend
necker
then
there
must
be
some
trick
played
on
him
necker
your
friend
ejaculated
the
crowd
for
the
name
had
great
influence
over
them
yes
my
friend
and
i
upheld
him
i
am
convinced
that
he
is
ignorant
of
my
being
in
prison
but
i
will
go
and
find
him
and
he
is
not
at
versailles
said
billet
but
at
brussels
he
is
exiled
his
daughter
lives
in
the
country
out
by
ouen
suggested
one
of
the
throng
whom
gilbert
thanked
without
seeing
who
it
was
friends
he
said
in
the
name
of
history
who
will
find
the
condemnation
of
tyranny
in
these
papers
cease
such
devastation
i
entreat
you
demolish
the
bastile
stone
by
stone
till
not
a
trace
remains
but
respect
documents
and
books
for
the
light
of
the
future
is
in
them
the
multitude
had
scarce
heard
the
rebuke
than
its
high
intelligence
gauged
he
was
correct
the
doctor
is
right
cried
a
hundred
voices
no
more
spoiling
let
us
take
these
papers
to
the
city
hall
a
fireman
who
had
brought
a
small
into
the
fort
with
half
a
dozen
comrades
directed
the
at
the
fire
which
was
about
to
repeat
a
conflagration
of
books
like
that
of
alexandria
and
they
put
it
out
at
whose
request
were
you
arrested
inquired
the
farmer
just
what
i
was
looking
for
but
the
name
is
blank
i
shall
learn
he
added
after
brief
meditation
tearing
out
the
leaf
concerning
himself
he
folded
it
up
and
pocketed
it
let
us
be
off
friends
said
he
we
have
no
farther
business
here
it
is
easier
to
say
let
us
go
than
manage
it
remarked
the
countryman
indeed
the
concourse
entering
the
castle
by
all
openings
choked
up
the
doorways
they
had
liberated
eight
prisoners
including
gilbert
four
excited
no
interest
they
had
been
locked
up
on
a
charge
of
forging
a
bank
draft
without
any
evidence
which
leads
to
the
premise
that
it
was
a
false
charge
they
had
been
in
jail
only
two
years
the
next
was
count
solange
a
man
of
thirty
who
was
in
rapture
he
hugged
his
liberators
exalted
their
victory
and
related
his
captivity
arrested
in
and
shut
up
in
vincennes
castle
on
a
blank
warrant
obtained
by
his
father
he
had
been
transferred
to
the
bastile
where
he
remained
five
years
without
having
seen
a
magistrate
or
being
examined
once
his
father
had
died
two
years
back
and
nobody
asked
after
him
had
not
the
bastile
been
captured
he
would
probably
have
died
there
unasked
for
white
was
another
wretch
he
was
sixty
years
old
and
jabbered
incoherent
words
with
a
foreign
accent
to
the
many
questions
he
replied
that
he
was
ignorant
how
long
he
had
been
detained
and
for
what
cause
he
remembered
he
was
a
kinsman
of
chief
of
police
sartines
a
turnkey
recalled
having
seen
lord
sartines
enter
white
cell
and
force
him
to
sign
a
power
of
attorney
but
the
prisoner
had
utterly
forgotten
the
incident
tavernier
was
the
oldest
of
all
he
had
been
ten
years
imprisoned
in
another
states
prison
before
coming
to
the
bastile
for
thirty
years
he
was
in
his
ninetieth
year
white
in
beard
and
hair
his
eyes
were
so
used
to
the
gloom
that
he
could
not
bear
the
light
when
they
broke
open
his
dungeon
he
did
not
understand
what
they
wanted
to
do
when
they
spoke
of
liberty
he
shook
his
head
when
finally
they
said
the
bastile
was
taken
by
the
people
he
cried
what
will
louis
xv
say
white
was
crazed
but
tavernier
was
an
idiot
the
delight
of
the
rest
was
terrible
to
view
so
close
was
it
to
alarm
it
called
for
vengeance
two
or
three
were
almost
ready
to
expire
amid
the
hubbub
of
thousands
of
voices
having
never
heard
two
speaking
at
the
same
time
while
in
the
prison
they
had
become
accustomed
to
the
slow
and
odd
sounds
of
wood
cracking
with
dampness
or
the
cricket
or
the
spider
weaving
its
web
or
the
frightened
rat
gnawing
his
prisonwalls
as
gilbert
appeared
the
resolution
was
unanimously
adopted
that
the
rescued
ones
should
be
carried
in
triumph
through
the
town
gilbert
wished
to
elude
this
ovation
but
he
could
not
do
so
as
he
was
recognized
as
well
as
billet
and
his
comrade
to
the
city
hall
shouted
everybody
and
gilbert
was
taken
up
on
the
shoulders
of
twenty
fellows
in
vain
did
gilbert
resist
and
billet
and
pitou
shower
punches
and
cuffs
on
their
joy
and
enthusiasm
had
made
the
people
hide
tough
fisticuffs
digs
with
the
elbow
or
thrusts
with
musket
butts
all
seemed
soft
as
strokings
and
only
enhanced
their
glee
a
spear
was
stuck
in
a
table
and
gilbert
placed
on
it
to
be
carried
thus
he
was
above
the
level
of
the
sea
of
heads
undulating
from
the
bastile
to
john
arcade
a
stormy
sea
which
transported
the
delivered
captives
amid
billows
crested
with
bloody
swords
bayonets
and
pikes
at
the
same
time
another
sea
roiled
terribly
and
irresistibly
a
group
closely
serried
around
the
prisoner
launay
around
him
the
shouts
were
as
loud
and
hearty
as
for
the
liberated
prisoners
but
they
were
of
death
not
of
triumph
gilbert
from
his
elevated
stand
did
not
lose
an
incident
of
the
horrible
occurrence
alone
among
all
his
fellow
captives
he
enjoyed
the
fulness
of
his
faculties
because
five
days
imprisonment
was
but
a
black
speck
in
his
career
his
eye
had
not
had
time
to
be
dimmed
by
the
bastile
darkness
usually
fighting
makes
men
hardhearted
only
during
the
action
men
coming
out
of
the
fire
with
their
own
lives
intact
feel
kindly
towards
their
foes
but
in
great
popular
uprisings
such
as
france
had
seen
many
from
the
jacquerie
or
peasants
outbreak
in
those
whom
fear
kept
in
the
rear
during
the
conflict
but
were
irritated
by
the
turbulence
are
ferocious
cowards
who
seek
after
the
victory
to
redden
their
hands
in
the
blood
of
those
they
dared
not
face
in
the
combat
they
take
their
share
in
the
reprisal
since
he
was
dragged
out
of
his
castle
the
march
of
the
governor
was
a
dolorous
one
elie
protected
by
his
uniform
and
the
part
he
had
taken
in
the
assault
marched
at
the
head
having
taken
launay
life
under
his
special
care
he
was
admired
for
the
manner
in
which
he
had
borne
himself
on
his
swordpoint
he
carried
the
letter
which
launay
had
passed
out
of
the
prison
loophole
to
be
taken
by
maillard
after
him
came
the
guards
carrying
the
keys
of
the
royal
fortress
then
maillard
bearing
the
bastile
flag
then
a
young
man
who
bore
on
a
pike
the
bastile
rules
and
regulations
an
odious
rescript
by
virtue
of
which
many
a
tear
had
been
made
to
flow
lastly
came
the
governor
protected
by
hullin
and
three
or
four
others
but
almost
covered
in
with
shaking
fists
flourished
blades
and
brandished
pikeheads
beside
this
column
almost
parallel
rolling
up
antoine
street
leading
from
the
main
avenue
to
the
river
seine
was
to
be
distinguished
another
no
less
awful
and
menacing
dragging
major
losme
whom
we
saw
struggle
against
his
superior
for
a
space
but
succumb
under
the
determination
to
resist
to
the
last
he
was
a
kind
good
and
brave
man
who
had
alleviated
many
miseries
within
the
jail
but
the
general
public
did
not
know
this
on
account
of
his
showy
uniform
many
took
him
to
be
the
governor
the
latter
clothed
in
grey
having
torn
off
the
embroidery
and
the
louis
scarf
was
shielded
by
some
doubt
from
those
who
did
not
recognize
him
this
was
the
spectacle
which
gilbert
beheld
with
his
gloomy
profound
and
observant
glance
amid
the
dangers
foreseen
by
his
powerful
organization
on
leaving
the
bastile
hullin
had
rallied
his
own
friends
the
surest
and
most
devoted
the
most
valiant
soldiers
of
the
day
these
four
or
five
tried
to
second
his
generous
design
of
shielding
the
governor
impartial
history
had
preserved
the
names
of
three
arne
chollat
and
lepine
these
four
with
hullin
and
maillard
in
advance
attempted
to
defend
the
life
for
which
a
hundred
thousand
were
clamoring
a
few
french
grenadiers
whose
uniform
had
become
popular
within
three
days
clustered
round
them
they
were
venerated
by
the
mob
as
long
as
his
generous
defenders
could
do
it
they
beat
off
the
blows
aimed
at
count
launay
but
he
could
not
evade
the
hooting
the
insults
and
the
curses
at
jouy
street
corner
all
the
grenadiers
had
been
brushed
aside
not
the
crowd
excitement
but
the
calculation
of
murderers
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
this
gilbert
had
seen
them
plucked
away
as
beads
are
flipped
off
a
string
he
foresaw
by
this
that
the
victory
would
be
tarnished
by
bloodshed
he
tried
to
get
off
the
table
but
iron
hands
held
him
to
it
in
his
impotence
he
sent
billet
and
pitou
to
the
defense
of
the
governor
and
obeying
his
voice
they
made
efforts
to
reach
the
threatened
one
his
protectors
stood
in
strong
need
of
reinforcement
chollat
who
had
eaten
nothing
since
the
evening
before
fell
with
exhaustion
though
he
tried
to
struggle
on
had
he
not
been
assisted
he
would
have
been
trodden
under
foot
his
falling
out
of
line
made
a
breach
in
the
living
wall
a
man
darted
in
by
this
crevasse
in
the
dyke
and
clubbing
his
musket
delivered
a
crushing
blow
at
the
governor
bared
head
lepine
saw
the
mace
descending
and
had
time
to
throw
his
arms
around
launay
and
receive
the
blow
on
his
own
forehead
stunned
by
the
shock
and
blinded
by
the
blood
he
staggered
back
and
when
he
recovered
he
was
twenty
paces
apart
from
the
prisoner
this
was
the
moment
when
billet
fought
his
way
up
towing
pitou
after
him
like
a
bringing
up
a
sailing
into
action
he
noticed
that
what
marked
launay
out
was
his
being
without
a
hat
he
snatched
off
his
own
and
put
it
on
the
count
head
the
latter
turned
and
recognized
him
i
thank
you
he
said
but
whatever
you
do
you
can
not
save
me
if
i
can
get
you
inside
the
city
hall
i
will
answer
for
all
said
hullin
yes
but
can
you
do
it
said
the
victim
god
helping
us
we
try
it
they
might
hope
this
as
they
reached
the
city
hall
square
it
was
packed
with
men
with
their
arms
bared
to
the
pit
waving
swords
and
spears
the
rumor
had
run
along
that
they
were
bringing
the
bastile
governor
and
his
major
and
they
were
waiting
for
them
like
a
pack
of
wolfhounds
held
back
from
breaking
up
the
quarry
as
soon
as
they
saw
the
party
they
rushed
at
it
hullin
saw
that
this
was
going
to
be
the
supreme
peril
and
final
struggle
if
he
could
only
get
the
governor
up
the
steps
and
inside
the
building
he
would
save
him
help
elie
and
millard
all
men
who
hold
our
honor
dear
he
shouted
elie
and
maillard
forged
onward
but
the
mob
closed
in
behind
them
and
they
were
isolated
the
crowd
saw
the
advantage
it
had
won
and
made
a
furious
effort
like
a
gigantic
boa
it
wound
its
coils
round
the
knot
billet
was
taken
off
his
feet
and
swept
away
with
pitou
who
stuck
to
him
the
same
whirlwind
made
hullin
reel
on
the
steps
where
he
fell
he
rose
but
was
forced
down
anew
and
launay
fell
with
him
this
time
he
stayed
down
up
to
the
last
he
did
not
murmur
or
beg
for
mercy
but
he
cried
in
a
hoarse
voice
do
not
at
least
keep
me
lingering
tigers
that
you
are
slay
me
outright
never
had
he
issued
an
order
executed
more
promptly
than
this
prayer
in
one
instant
armed
hands
flourished
round
his
stooped
head
fists
and
plunging
blades
were
seen
and
then
a
head
severed
from
the
trunk
rose
disgustingly
on
the
tip
of
a
pike
it
had
preserved
its
cold
and
scornful
smile
this
was
the
first
head
lopped
off
by
the
revolution
gilbert
had
foreseen
the
atrocity
he
had
tried
again
to
dart
to
the
rescue
but
a
hundred
hands
held
him
down
he
turned
his
head
and
sighed
this
head
was
lifted
with
its
eyes
glaring
up
to
the
window
where
flesselles
stood
surrounded
and
supported
by
the
electors
as
if
to
bid
him
a
last
farewell
it
would
be
hard
to
say
which
was
the
paler
his
face
or
the
corpses
all
at
once
a
deafening
uproar
burst
from
where
the
headless
body
lay
in
searching
it
in
the
vest
pocket
was
found
the
note
addressed
to
him
by
the
provost
of
the
traders
the
one
he
had
shown
to
losme
it
will
be
remembered
as
in
these
terms
hold
out
firmly
i
will
amuse
the
parisians
with
cockades
and
promises
before
day
is
done
bezenval
will
send
you
reinforcements
flesselles
a
horrible
yell
of
blasphemy
rose
from
the
pavement
to
the
window
where
the
writer
stood
without
divining
the
cause
he
understood
the
threat
and
threw
himself
back
but
he
had
been
seen
and
was
known
to
be
within
the
rush
for
him
was
so
universal
that
even
the
bearers
of
gilbert
left
him
to
join
the
hunters
gilbert
sought
to
enter
with
them
to
protect
flesselles
he
had
not
run
up
three
steps
before
he
felt
himself
pulled
back
by
the
coatskirts
he
turned
to
shake
off
the
hand
but
saw
they
were
of
billet
and
pitou
from
the
higher
standpoint
he
overlooked
the
square
what
is
going
on
over
there
he
inquired
pointing
towards
a
spot
of
commotion
come
doctor
come
said
the
two
countrymen
together
the
butchers
said
the
doctor
at
that
instant
major
losme
fell
struck
down
by
a
hatchet
in
their
hatred
the
people
confounded
the
persecutor
of
the
prisoners
with
the
merciful
warden
let
us
begone
said
the
physician
for
i
begin
to
be
ashamed
that
such
murderers
let
me
out
do
not
say
that
doctor
reproved
billet
those
who
stormed
the
bastile
are
not
the
cutthroats
yonder
as
they
descended
the
steps
which
he
had
mounted
to
try
to
help
flesselles
the
throng
which
had
flowed
through
the
doorway
was
hurled
forth
in
the
midst
of
the
battling
gathering
one
man
was
struggling
take
him
to
the
palais
royal
vociferated
the
thousands
yes
my
friends
yes
my
good
friends
to
the
palais
royal
gasped
this
wretch
but
the
human
inundation
rolled
towards
the
river
as
though
it
intended
to
drown
him
another
they
mean
to
murder
shouted
gilbert
let
us
try
to
save
him
at
any
rate
but
he
had
hardly
got
the
words
out
of
his
mouth
before
a
resounded
flesselles
disappeared
in
the
smoke
gilbert
covered
his
eyes
cursing
the
multitude
great
but
unable
to
remain
pure
and
sullying
the
victory
by
a
triple
murder
when
he
took
his
hands
from
his
eyes
he
beheld
three
heads
on
pike
points
flesselles
launay
and
losme
one
rose
on
the
city
hall
steps
another
in
the
mouth
of
tixeranderie
street
and
the
last
in
pelletier
street
so
that
the
trio
formed
a
triangle
he
remembered
the
sign
in
the
order
of
the
invisibles
oh
balsamo
he
muttered
is
this
the
emblem
of
liberty
and
sighing
he
fled
up
vannerie
street
dragging
billet
and
pitou
with
him
chapter
xv
the
young
visionary
meeting
with
a
public
conveyance
the
doctor
got
into
it
with
billet
and
pitou
and
they
went
to
college
where
sebastian
was
still
in
the
sick
ward
the
principal
received
the
doctor
with
deep
regard
as
he
knew
him
to
be
the
foremost
pupil
of
the
physicians
and
chemists
cabanis
and
condorcet
he
imparted
his
fears
as
well
to
the
doctor
as
to
the
parent
of
his
pupil
that
the
boy
was
too
much
given
to
moody
fits
you
are
right
said
gilbert
gravity
in
a
boy
is
a
token
of
lunacy
or
weakness
while
pitou
was
being
refreshed
in
the
principal
residence
and
billet
shared
a
bottle
with
the
gentleman
himself
the
physician
conferred
with
his
son
i
ask
you
about
your
health
said
the
father
to
the
pallid
nervous
youth
and
you
answer
that
you
are
well
now
i
ask
you
if
your
reserve
towards
your
schoolfellows
arises
from
pride
and
i
hope
you
will
answer
no
be
encouraged
father
said
sebastian
it
is
neither
pride
nor
ill
health
but
sorrow
i
have
a
dream
which
frightens
me
and
yet
it
is
not
a
terror
when
a
little
boy
i
had
such
visions
ah
two
or
three
times
i
was
lost
in
the
woods
following
this
phantom
gilbert
looked
at
the
speaker
in
alarm
it
was
thus
father
dear
i
would
be
playing
with
the
other
children
of
the
village
when
i
saw
nothing
but
when
i
left
them
i
heard
the
rustle
of
a
silk
dress
as
if
some
one
wearing
it
were
going
away
from
me
i
would
thrust
out
my
hands
to
seize
it
but
grasp
nothing
but
air
but
as
the
sound
diminished
the
vision
appeared
more
and
more
distinct
this
cloudy
vapor
would
gradually
assume
a
human
shape
it
was
a
woman
who
glided
rather
than
walked
and
grew
the
more
clear
as
it
was
buried
in
the
woody
depths
a
strange
weird
irresistible
spell
drew
me
on
in
the
woman
steps
i
pursued
her
with
extended
arms
mute
like
she
was
often
i
tried
to
call
her
but
my
lips
would
not
emit
a
sound
i
pursued
without
ever
overtaking
until
the
prodigy
announcing
her
coming
was
reproduced
for
her
departure
she
became
misty
and
faded
away
spent
with
weariness
i
would
drop
on
the
sward
where
she
had
disappeared
pitou
would
find
me
there
sometimes
not
till
the
following
day
gilbert
looked
at
the
youth
with
increasing
disquiet
his
fingers
were
fixed
on
his
pulse
sebastian
seemed
to
understand
his
feelings
do
not
be
uneasy
about
it
said
he
i
know
that
it
is
a
phantasm
what
did
this
woman
look
like
majestic
as
a
queen
have
you
seen
her
lately
i
have
seen
her
here
that
is
in
the
garden
reserved
for
the
teachers
i
saw
her
glide
from
our
grounds
into
that
garden
and
one
day
when
master
berardier
pleased
with
my
composition
asked
me
to
state
a
favor
i
got
leave
to
stroll
in
this
garden
she
appeared
to
me
strange
hallucination
thought
gilbert
yet
not
so
remarkable
in
the
child
of
a
mesmeric
medium
who
do
you
think
this
woman
is
my
mother
gilbert
turned
pale
and
clasped
his
hand
to
his
heart
as
though
to
staunch
a
wound
but
this
is
all
a
dream
and
i
am
almost
as
crazed
as
you
it
may
be
all
a
dream
said
the
youth
with
pensive
eye
but
the
reality
of
the
dream
exists
i
have
seen
the
lady
alive
in
a
magnificent
equipage
drawn
by
four
horses
in
satory
woods
near
versailles
on
the
last
holiday
when
we
were
taken
out
there
i
nearly
swooned
on
seeing
her
i
do
not
know
why
for
she
could
not
be
my
mother
who
is
dead
and
she
is
the
same
as
the
vision
he
remarked
the
giddiness
of
his
father
who
ran
his
hand
over
his
brow
and
he
was
frightened
by
his
white
face
i
see
i
am
wrong
to
tell
you
such
nonsense
he
said
oh
no
speak
all
you
can
on
the
subject
and
we
shall
try
to
cure
you
responded
the
doctor
why
i
am
born
to
musing
it
takes
up
half
my
time
i
love
this
ghost
though
it
avoids
me
and
seems
sometimes
to
repulse
me
do
not
expel
it
i
should
else
be
all
alone
when
you
are
on
your
travels
or
return
to
america
i
hope
we
shall
not
part
he
said
to
his
boy
whom
he
embraced
for
i
want
to
take
you
on
my
journeys
was
my
mother
fair
inquired
the
youth
very
was
answered
in
the
doctor
stifled
voice
and
did
she
love
you
as
much
as
i
do
continued
the
child
sebastian
never
speak
her
name
to
me
cried
the
physician
kissing
him
a
last
time
and
bounding
out
of
the
garden
instead
of
following
him
the
boy
dropped
on
a
bench
disconsolate
in
the
yard
gilbert
found
billet
and
pitou
refreshed
by
the
feast
of
the
principal
to
whom
the
doctor
recommended
special
care
of
his
son
and
the
three
men
got
into
the
hack
again
chapter

the
physician
for
the
state
on
the
way
back
to
paris
gilbert
stopped
at
ouen
to
see
daughter
he
had
a
suspicion
that
the
financier
had
not
gone
to
brussels
as
everybody
was
led
to
think
indeed
it
was
at
madam
de
stael
country
house
that
he
was
concealed
awaiting
events
he
made
no
difficulty
in
supplying
his
friend
with
a
letter
of
introduction
to
the
king
armed
with
this
the
doctor
leaving
billet
and
pitou
in
a
pretty
hotel
of
paris
where
the
farmer
usually
stayed
hurried
to
versailles
it
was
half
past
ten
but
versailles
could
not
sleep
now
it
was
agitated
about
how
the
king
would
take
the
insult
of
the
bastile
being
captured
it
was
not
a
slap
in
the
face
like
mirabeau
refusal
to
obey
the
order
of
the
king
to
vacate
the
but
a
the
palace
and
surrounding
sites
were
packed
with
troops
but
gilbert
managed
to
reach
the
chamber
where
necker
letter
passed
him
into
the
royal
presence
the
doctor
examined
in
silence
the
pilot
given
to
france
in
stormy
weather
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
many
long
years
for
the
physiognomist
who
had
studied
under
lavater
the
magnetiser
who
had
read
the
future
with
balsamo
the
philosopher
who
had
meditated
with
rousseau
the
traveler
who
had
reviewed
many
peoples
all
in
this
short
stout
man
signified
degeneracy
impotence
and
ruin
when
louis
had
read
the
introduction
he
dismissed
all
attendants
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
not
devoid
of
majesty
is
it
true
said
he
that
you
are
the
author
of
the
memoirs
on
administration
and
politics
which
much
struck
me
you
are
young
for
such
a
work
i
am
but
study
and
misfortune
age
a
man
treat
me
as
an
old
one
why
are
you
so
slow
to
present
yourself
to
me
because
i
had
no
need
to
speak
to
your
majesty
what
i
could
freely
and
easily
write
but
you
ought
to
have
been
informed
that
i
was
kindly
towards
you
observed
the
monarch
suspiciously
your
majesty
alludes
to
my
audacity
in
requesting
him
in
token
of
having
read
my
work
with
gratification
to
show
a
light
in
his
own
study
window
i
saw
that
and
was
gladdened
but
your
majesty
offered
a
reward
and
i
want
none
any
way
you
come
like
a
true
soldier
when
the
action
is
on
but
i
am
not
used
to
meet
those
who
do
not
haste
when
recompense
is
offered
i
deserve
none
born
a
frenchman
loving
my
land
jealous
of
its
prosperity
confounding
my
individuality
with
that
of
its
thirty
millions
of
men
i
work
for
them
in
toiling
for
myself
a
selfish
man
deserves
no
recompense
excuse
me
you
had
another
reason
you
thought
the
state
of
events
serious
and
held
back
for
a
more
serious
one
your
majesty
guesses
correctly
i
like
frankness
said
the
king
reddening
for
he
was
nervous
so
you
predicted
ruin
for
the
sovereign
and
you
wanted
to
be
out
of
the
reach
of
the
flying
splinters
no
sire
since
i
hasten
towards
the
danger
you
come
fresh
from
necker
and
you
naturally
speak
like
him
where
is
he
ready
at
hand
to
obey
your
orders
all
for
the
best
for
i
shall
require
him
returned
louis
with
a
sigh
in
politics
nobody
should
sulk
a
plan
may
be
good
and
fail
from
accidents
sire
your
majesty
reasons
admirably
said
gilbert
coming
to
his
aid
but
the
main
thing
now
is
to
see
into
the
future
clearly
as
a
physician
i
speak
bluntly
at
crises
do
you
attach
much
importance
to
the
riot
of
yesterday
it
is
not
riot
but
revolution
and
would
you
have
me
treat
with
rebels
and
murderers
their
taking
the
bastile
by
force
was
an
act
of
rebellion
their
slaying
of
launay
losme
and
flesselles
murder
they
should
be
held
apart
those
who
stormed
the
bastile
were
heroes
those
who
murdered
those
gentlemen
butchers
you
are
right
sir
said
the
king
his
lips
blanching
after
a
transient
blush
and
perspiration
appearing
on
his
brow
you
are
indeed
a
physician
or
rather
a
surgeon
for
you
cut
into
the
tender
flesh
but
let
us
return
to
the
subject
you
are
gilbert
who
wrote
those
articles
sire
i
consider
it
is
a
great
happiness
that
my
name
is
retained
in
your
memory
it
must
not
have
sounded
new
when
spoken
a
week
ago
in
your
hearing
i
mean
that
when
i
was
arrested
and
put
in
the
bastile
i
always
understood
that
no
arrest
is
made
of
any
importance
without
the
king
being
advised
you
in
the
bastile
cried
the
astonished
king
here
is
the
order
to
lock
me
up
put
in
prison
six
days
ago
by
the
royal
order
i
was
released
by
the
grace
of
the
people
at
three
this
day
did
not
your
majesty
hear
the
cannon
they
broke
the
doors
down
to
let
me
out
ah
i
should
be
glad
if
i
might
say
the
cannon
was
not
fired
on
royalty
at
the
same
time
as
the
bastile
thus
the
king
muttered
oh
sire
do
not
take
a
prison
as
the
emblem
of
the
monarchy
say
on
the
contrary
that
you
are
glad
the
bastile
is
taken
for
i
trust
no
such
injustice
as
i
was
the
victim
of
will
be
henceforth
committed
in
the
name
of
the
ruler
who
is
kept
ignorant
of
it
but
there
must
be
some
cause
for
your
arrest
none
that
i
am
aware
of
sire
i
was
arrested
as
soon
as
i
landed
and
imprisoned
that
is
all
there
is
in
it
really
sir
said
the
monarch
mildly
is
there
not
selfishness
in
your
dilating
on
your
troubles
when
i
want
my
own
dealt
with
i
only
need
a
word
did
your
majesty
have
anything
to
do
with
my
arrest
i
was
unaware
of
your
return
to
this
kingdom
i
am
happy
for
this
reply
i
may
loudly
say
that
your
majesty
is
defamed
when
evil
is
attributed
to
you
and
cite
myself
as
example
you
put
balm
on
the
wound
doctor
said
the
other
smiling
oh
sire
i
will
liberally
anoint
it
and
i
will
cure
it
i
promise
but
you
must
strongly
wish
the
healing
done
but
before
pledging
yourself
too
deeply
i
should
like
you
to
notice
the
note
on
the
prison
record
the
king
frowned
to
read
at
the
queen
request
have
you
incurred
the
queen
disfavor
he
inquired
sire
i
am
sure
that
her
majesty
knows
me
less
than
yourself
but
you
must
have
committed
some
misdeed
for
people
are
not
put
in
the
bastile
for
nothing
humph
several
in
this
situation
have
come
out
if
you
run
over
your
life
i
will
do
so
out
aloud
but
do
not
be
uneasy
it
will
not
take
long
since
sixteen
i
have
toiled
without
repose
the
pupil
of
rousseau
the
companion
of
joseph
balsamo
the
friend
of
lafayette
and
washington
since
i
quitted
france
i
have
not
a
fault
to
reproach
myself
with
not
a
wrongful
deed
since
heaven
gave
me
the
charge
of
bodies
i
have
shed
my
blood
for
mankind
and
staunched
its
flow
in
others
thousands
live
to
bless
my
labors
in
america
you
worked
with
the
innovators
and
propagate
their
principles
by
your
writings
yes
sire
i
forgot
this
claim
on
the
gratitude
of
monarchs
and
peoples
this
silenced
the
king
sire
you
know
my
life
now
i
have
offended
and
injured
nobody
queen
or
beggar
and
i
humbly
ask
your
majesty
why
i
was
imprisoned
i
will
speak
to
the
queen
about
it
do
you
believe
that
the
warrant
to
arrest
and
imprison
came
directly
from
her
majesty
i
do
not
believe
this
i
rather
presume
that
her
majesty
countersigned
it
but
when
a
queen
approves
she
commands
countess
of
charny
read
the
king
on
the
record
sheet
is
it
she
who
wanted
you
imprisoned
why
what
have
you
done
to
poor
charny
before
this
morning
i
never
heard
of
any
lady
of
that
title
charny
muttered
the
king
musing
virtue
goodness
chastity
in
person
you
see
they
have
put
me
in
prison
in
the
name
of
the
christian
graces
remarked
gilbert
laughing
oh
i
will
have
this
cleared
up
said
the
king
and
ringing
the
bell
he
bade
the
servant
bring
the
countess
of
charny
into
his
presence
chapter
xvii
the
countess
of
charny
gilbert
had
retired
into
a
window
recess
while
the
king
paced
the
hall
called
on
account
of
a
round
window
in
the
wall
thinking
now
of
public
matters
then
of
his
visitor
persistence
though
nothing
but
news
from
paris
ought
to
have
enchained
him
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
the
lady
entered
dressed
in
the
extreme
of
the
showy
and
fantastic
fashion
of
marie
antoinette
and
her
court
she
was
lovely
this
countess
charny
with
a
peerless
figure
and
her
hand
was
aristocratic
to
the
utmost
with
which
she
played
with
a
small
cane
she
andrea
taverney
muttered
gilbert
involuntarily
shrinking
behind
the
curtains
my
lady
i
ask
your
presence
for
a
little
information
began
the
monarch
seeing
nothing
of
gilbert
emotion
i
am
ready
to
satisfy
your
majesty
the
voice
attracted
the
doctor
who
came
a
little
forward
a
week
ago
or
so
a
blank
letter
under
the
royal
seal
was
delivered
to
minister
necker
went
on
the
king
for
the
arrest
gilbert
had
his
eye
on
the
lady
who
was
pale
feverish
and
fretful
as
if
bent
under
the
weight
of
a
secret
this
warrant
was
applied
for
by
your
ladyship
and
countersigned
by
the
queen
i
say
this
to
refresh
your
memory
why
do
you
not
say
something
countess
it
is
true
your
majesty
she
faltered
in
a
feverish
abstraction
i
wrote
for
the
letter
filled
up
the
blanks
and
the
queen
backed
it
will
you
please
tell
me
what
crime
the
person
committed
for
whom
the
measure
was
taken
demanded
louis
sire
i
may
not
do
that
but
i
shall
say
the
crime
was
great
then
you
should
do
so
to
the
object
continued
the
king
what
you
refuse
the
king
louis
you
can
not
doctor
gilbert
he
stepped
aside
to
discover
the
doctor
who
opened
the
curtains
and
appeared
as
pale
as
the
staggering
lady
she
tossed
her
head
backwards
as
if
going
to
swoon
and
only
kept
her
footing
by
aid
of
a
table
she
leaned
on
it
in
dull
despair
like
one
whom
a
snake
bite
was
filling
with
poison
my
lady
let
me
put
the
question
to
you
which
the
king
addressed
said
gilbert
andrea
lips
moved
but
no
sound
struggled
forth
what
did
i
do
to
you
lady
that
your
order
threw
me
into
a
hideous
dungeon
the
voice
made
her
leap
as
if
it
tore
the
very
soul
in
her
suddenly
lowering
her
cold
gaze
on
him
she
replied
sir
i
do
not
know
you
but
while
she
was
speaking
the
mesmerist
stared
at
her
with
so
much
fixedness
and
his
glance
was
so
charged
with
invincible
boldness
that
her
own
lost
lustre
under
his
countess
you
see
what
this
abuse
of
the
royal
signature
leads
to
gently
reproved
the
monarch
you
confess
you
do
not
know
this
gentleman
who
is
a
renowned
physician
a
learned
man
whom
you
can
blame
in
no
way
andrea
darted
a
withering
glance
at
gilbert
who
bore
it
calmly
and
proudly
i
am
saying
that
it
is
wicked
to
visit
on
the
innocent
the
faults
of
another
i
know
you
have
not
a
bad
heart
he
hastened
to
add
for
he
was
trembling
lest
he
offended
his
wife
favorite
and
that
you
would
not
pursue
anybody
in
your
hatred
unless
he
merited
it
but
you
will
understand
that
such
mistakes
must
not
be
made
in
the
future
doctor
he
went
on
turning
to
the
other
hearer
these
things
are
the
fault
of
our
period
rather
than
of
persons
we
are
born
in
corruption
and
we
shall
die
in
it
but
we
are
going
to
try
to
make
matters
better
in
which
work
i
expect
you
to
join
us
dear
doctor
he
stopped
thinking
he
had
said
enough
to
please
both
parties
if
he
had
spoken
thus
at
a
parliamentary
session
he
would
have
been
applauded
but
his
audience
of
two
personal
enemies
little
heeded
his
conciliatory
philosophy
but
recommenced
gilbert
while
not
knowing
me
you
knew
another
gilbert
whose
crime
weighs
upon
his
namesake
it
is
not
my
place
to
question
the
lady
will
your
majesty
deign
to
inquire
of
her
ladyship
what
this
infamous
man
did
countess
you
can
not
refuse
so
just
a
request
the
queen
must
know
since
she
authorized
the
arrest
said
andrea
evasively
but
it
is
not
enough
that
the
queen
should
be
convinced
said
the
sovereign
it
is
necessary
that
the
king
also
should
know
the
queen
is
what
she
is
but
i
am
the
king
sire
the
gilbert
for
whom
the
warrant
was
intended
committed
a
horrible
crime
sixteen
years
ago
will
your
majesty
please
inquire
what
age
this
gilbert
is
he
may
be
replied
andrea
sire
then
the
crime
was
done
by
a
boy
not
a
man
and
does
he
not
deserve
some
indulgence
who
has
for
sixteen
years
deplored
his
boyish
crime
you
seem
to
know
him
has
he
committed
no
other
crime
than
this
sin
of
youth
demanded
the
king
i
am
less
indulgent
to
him
than
others
but
i
can
say
that
he
reproaches
himself
with
none
other
only
with
having
dipped
his
pen
in
poison
and
written
odious
libels
sire
please
ask
my
lady
if
the
real
cause
of
the
arrest
and
committal
of
this
gilbert
was
not
to
enable
his
enemies
particularly
one
enemy
to
get
possession
of
a
certain
casket
containing
papers
possibly
compromising
a
great
lady
of
the
court
andrea
shuddered
from
head
to
foot
countess
what
casket
is
this
inquired
the
king
who
noticed
the
plain
pallor
and
agitation
of
the
lady
no
more
shifting
and
subterfuges
cried
gilbert
feeling
that
he
was
master
of
the
situation
enough
falsehoods
on
both
sides
i
am
gilbert
of
the
crime
the
libels
the
casket
and
you
the
real
great
lady
of
the
court
i
take
the
king
as
the
judge
accept
him
and
we
will
tell
our
judge
under
heaven
and
the
king
will
decide
tell
his
majesty
what
you
please
but
i
shall
say
nothing
more
for
i
do
not
know
you
responded
the
haughty
lady
and
the
casket
you
do
not
know
about
that
no
more
than
of
you
but
she
shook
with
the
effort
to
make
this
denial
like
a
statue
rocking
at
the
base
beware
said
the
doctor
you
can
not
have
forgotten
that
i
am
the
pupil
of
the
magician
who
has
transmitted
to
me
the
power
he
had
over
you
once
only
will
you
answer
the
question
my
casket
then
lifting
his
hand
full
of
threatening
he
thundered
nature
of
steel
heart
of
adamant
bend
melt
shatter
under
the
irresistible
pressure
of
my
will
you
shall
speak
andrea
and
none
king
or
any
powers
less
than
heaven
shall
subtract
you
from
my
sway
you
shall
unfold
your
mind
to
the
august
witness
and
he
shall
read
what
you
hid
in
the
black
recesses
of
your
soul
sire
you
shall
know
all
through
her
who
refuses
to
speak
sleep
andrea
taverney
countess
of
charny
sleep
and
speak
for
i
will
it
hardly
were
the
words
uttered
before
the
woman
stopped
short
in
beginning
a
scream
held
out
her
arms
for
support
as
if
struck
by
blindness
finding
none
she
fell
into
the
king
arms
and
he
placed
her
in
a
chair
ha
exclaimed
he
trembling
like
herself
i
have
heard
about
hypnotism
but
never
saw
an
exhibition
is
not
this
magnetic
sleep
to
which
you
oblige
her
to
succumb
doctor
yes
my
lord
take
her
hand
and
ask
her
why
she
had
me
arrested
astounded
by
the
scene
louis
receded
but
interested
he
did
as
directed
as
andrea
resisted
the
magnetizer
touched
the
crown
of
her
head
with
his
palm
saying
speak
i
will
it
she
sighed
and
her
arms
fell
her
head
sank
back
and
she
wept
ugh
i
hate
you
she
hissed
hate
away
but
speak
so
countess
said
the
king
you
wanted
to
arrest
and
imprison
the
doctor
yes
and
the
casket
how
could
i
leave
that
in
his
hands
muttered
the
lady
in
a
hollow
voice
tell
me
about
that
said
the
king
forgetting
etiquet
and
kneeling
beside
the
countess
i
learnt
that
gilbert
who
had
in
sixteen
years
been
twice
back
in
france
purposed
another
voyage
to
settle
here
chief
of
police
crosne
informed
me
that
he
had
on
a
previous
return
bought
an
estate
at
villers
cotterets
that
his
farmer
enjoyed
his
trust
and
i
suspected
that
the
casket
with
his
papers
was
at
his
house
how
could
you
suspect
that
i
i
went
to
mesmer
and
had
myself
put
into
a
trance
when
my
own
medium
i
wrote
down
the
revelations
i
wanted
wonderful
exclaimed
the
sovereign
i
went
to
chief
crosne
and
he
lent
me
his
best
man
one
wolfstep
who
brought
me
the
casket
where
is
it
cried
gilbert
no
lying
where
is
my
casket
in
my
rooms
at
versailles
said
andrea
trembling
nervously
and
bursting
into
tears
wolfstep
is
waiting
for
me
here
by
appointment
since
eleven
twelve
was
striking
where
is
he
standing
in
the
waiting
room
leaning
on
the
mantleshelf
the
casket
is
on
the
table
before
him
oh
haste
count
charny
who
was
not
to
return
before
will
be
back
on
account
of
the
events
he
is
at
sevres
now
get
wolfstep
away
for
fear
my
lord
will
see
him
your
majesty
hears
this
casket
belongs
to
me
will
the
king
please
order
it
to
be
returned
to
me
instantly
placing
a
screen
before
the
countess
louis
called
the
officer
on
duty
and
gave
him
orders
what
to
do
this
curiosity
of
a
monarch
whose
throne
was
being
undermined
to
a
purely
physical
problem
would
make
those
smile
who
expected
him
to
be
engrossed
with
politics
but
he
concentrated
himself
on
this
private
speculation
and
returned
to
see
the
mesmerizer
and
the
medium
in
the
mesmeric
slumber
andrea
wondrous
beauty
was
displayed
in
its
entire
splendor
she
who
had
in
her
youth
enthralled
louis
xv
now
enchanted
his
successor
gilbert
turned
his
head
away
sighing
he
could
not
resist
the
prompting
to
give
his
adored
this
degree
of
supernal
beauty
and
now
more
unhappy
than
pygmalion
for
he
knew
how
insensible
was
the
lovely
statue
he
was
frightened
by
his
own
work
gilbert
knew
how
to
own
his
ignorance
like
all
superior
men
he
knew
what
he
could
do
but
not
the
wherefore
where
did
you
study
the
art
under
mesmer
asked
the
king
i
saw
the
most
astonishing
phenomena
ten
years
before
that
german
came
into
france
my
master
was
a
more
amazing
man
superior
to
any
you
can
name
for
i
have
seen
him
execute
surgical
operations
of
incredible
daring
no
science
was
unknown
to
him
but
i
ought
not
to
utter
his
name
before
your
majesty
i
should
like
to
hear
it
though
it
was
satan
itself
my
lord
you
honor
me
almost
with
a
friend
confidence
in
speaking
thus
my
master
was
baron
balsamo
afterwards
count
cagliostro
that
charlatan
exclaimed
louis
blushing
for
he
could
not
help
remembering
the
plot
of
the
diamond
necklace
in
which
cagliostro
had
figured
as
friend
of
cardinal
rohan
and
consequently
enemy
of
marie
antoinette
the
king
believed
his
wife
but
the
world
thought
that
she
had
participated
in
the
fraud
on
the
court
jewelers
we
have
related
the
story
according
to
our
lights
in
the
volume
of
this
series
entitled
the
queen
necklace
charlatan
repeated
gilbert
warmly
you
are
right
the
name
comes
from
the
italian
word
meaning
to
patter
to
talk
freely
and
no
one
was
more
ready
than
cagliostro
to
talk
instructively
where
the
seed
would
fall
on
fruitful
ground
this
cagliostro
whom
you
praise
was
a
great
enemy
of
kings
observed
louis
rather
say
of
queen
retorted
gilbert
in
the
trial
of
prince
rohan
his
conduct
was
equivocal
sire
then
as
ever
he
fulfilled
his
mission
to
mankind
he
may
have
acted
mistakenly
then
but
i
studied
under
the
physician
and
philosopher
not
under
the
politician
well
well
said
the
king
suffering
under
the
wound
to
his
person
and
his
pride
we
are
forgetting
the
countess
who
is
in
pain
i
will
awaken
her
presently
for
here
is
the
casket
coming
in
fact
the
messenger
was
arriving
with
the
small
box
which
he
handed
to
the
king
he
nodded
his
satisfaction
and
the
officer
went
out
sire
it
is
my
casket
but
i
would
remark
that
it
contains
papers
damning
to
the
countess
and
carry
it
away
unopened
sir
said
the
monarch
coldly
do
not
awaken
the
lady
here
i
detest
shrieks
groans
noise
she
will
awaken
wherever
you
suggest
her
removal
in
the
queen
apartments
will
be
best
how
long
will
it
take
ten
minutes
awaken
in
fifteen
minutes
ordered
the
mesmerizer
to
the
lady
two
guardsmen
entered
and
carried
out
the
countess
seated
on
the
chair
my
lady
fainted
here
said
the
king
to
the
officer
bear
her
to
the
queen
what
can
i
do
for
you
dr
gilbert
he
asked
when
they
were
alone
i
wish
to
be
honorary
house
physician
to
your
majesty
it
is
a
position
which
will
do
nobody
umbrage
and
is
more
of
trust
than
emolument
and
lustre
granted
gilbert
remind
me
affectionately
to
necker
bring
me
supper
he
added
for
nothing
could
make
the
king
forget
a
meal

revolution
like
a
philosopher
and
recreate
himself
with
a
spiritualistic
seance
the
queen
was
rallying
the
combative
around
her
in
her
rooms
she
sat
at
a
table
with
priests
courtiers
generals
and
her
ladies
surrounding
her
at
the
doorways
young
officers
full
of
ardor
and
courage
rejoiced
in
the
riots
which
gave
them
a
chance
to
show
their
military
gifts
as
at
a
tourney
under
view
of
their
queens
of
beauty
the
queen
was
no
longer
the
sweet
girl
whom
we
saw
in
our
work
entitled
balsamo
the
magician
or
the
fair
princess
who
went
to
baths
with
princess
lamballe
but
the
haughty
and
imperious
queen
who
was
neither
marie
antoinette
nor
queen
of
france
but
the
austrian
eagless
she
looked
up
as
prince
lambesq
arrived
dusty
splashed
his
boots
torn
and
his
sabre
bent
so
as
not
to
be
sheathed
properly
well
my
lord
she
said
you
come
from
paris
what
are
the
people
doing
killing
and
burning
from
madness
or
malice
from
ferocity
nay
prince
she
replied
after
meditating
the
people
are
not
ferocious
hide
nothing
from
me
is
it
delirium
or
hate
i
believe
it
is
hate
at
the
point
of
delirium
against
me
what
does
it
matter
said
dreux
breze
stepping
forward
the
people
may
hate
any
one
saving
your
majesty
the
queen
did
not
notice
the
flattery
the
people
replied
lambesq
are
acting
in
hatred
of
all
above
them
good
that
is
the
truth
at
last
exclaimed
the
royal
lady
resolutely
i
feel
that
is
so
i
am
speaking
as
a
soldier
continued
the
cavalrist
speak
so
what
is
to
be
done
nothing
what
cried
she
emboldened
by
the
protest
from
among
the
coat
and
sword
wearers
nothing
do
you
a
lorraine
prince
tell
this
to
the
queen
of
france
when
the
people
are
killing
and
burning
a
fresh
murmur
this
time
approbative
hailed
her
speech
she
turned
embraced
all
the
gathering
with
flaring
eyes
and
tried
to
distinguish
whose
flamed
the
most
brightly
thinking
they
would
be
the
most
loyal
do
nothing
repeated
the
prince
for
the
parisians
will
cool
down
if
not
irritated
they
are
warlike
only
when
teased
why
give
them
the
honors
of
a
war
and
the
risks
of
a
battle
keep
tranquil
and
in
three
days
paris
will
not
talk
about
the
matter
but
the
bastile
shut
the
doors
and
trap
all
those
who
are
inside
some
laughs
sounded
among
the
groups
take
care
prince
said
the
lady
now
you
are
going
to
the
other
extreme
and
too
much
encouraging
me
with
a
thoughtful
mien
she
went
over
to
where
her
favorite
the
countess
of
polignac
was
in
a
brown
study
on
a
lounge
the
news
had
frightened
the
lady
she
smiled
only
when
the
queen
stood
before
her
and
that
was
a
faint
and
sickly
smile
like
a
wilted
lily
what
do
you
say
to
this
countess
nothing
and
she
shook
her
head
with
unspeakable
discouragement
heaven
help
us
our
dashing
diana
is
afraid
said
the
queen
bending
over
her
we
want
our
intrepid
countess
charny
here
it
seems
to
me
that
we
need
her
to
cheer
us
up
the
countess
was
going
out
when
the
king
sent
for
her
explained
an
attendant
then
only
did
marie
antoinette
perceive
the
isolation
and
stillness
around
her
the
recent
strange
and
events
had
hit
versailles
hard
making
the
hardest
hearts
tender
more
by
astonishment
than
fear
the
sovereign
understood
that
she
must
lift
up
these
disheartened
spirits
as
nobody
suggests
any
advice
i
shall
act
on
my
own
impulse
she
said
the
people
are
not
wicked
but
led
astray
everybody
drew
nearer
they
hate
us
because
they
do
not
know
us
let
us
go
up
to
them
to
punish
interposed
a
voice
for
they
know
we
are
their
masters
and
to
doubt
us
is
a
crime
oh
baron
she
said
recognizing
bezenval
do
you
come
to
give
us
good
advice
i
have
given
it
the
king
will
punish
but
as
a
kind
father
does
he
loveth
well
who
chasteneth
soundly
replied
the
noble
are
you
of
this
thinking
prince
she
asked
of
lambesq
the
populace
have
committed
assassinations
which
they
call
retaliation
observed
a
sweet
fresh
voice
which
made
the
queen
turn
yes
but
that
is
where
their
error
lies
my
dear
lamballe
so
we
shall
be
indulgent
but
resumed
the
princess
with
her
bland
voice
before
one
talks
of
punishment
one
ought
to
be
sure
of
winning
the
victory
methinks
a
general
outcry
rose
against
this
piece
of
good
sense
from
the
noble
lips
not
vanquish
with
the
swiss
troops
and
the
germans
and
the
lifeguards
do
you
doubt
the
army
and
the
nobility
exclaimed
a
young
man
in
bercheny
hussian
uniform
have
we
deserved
such
a
slur
bear
in
mind
royal
lady
that
the
king
can
put
in
battle
array
forty
thousand
men
throw
them
into
paris
by
the
four
sides
and
destroy
the
town
forty
thousand
proven
soldiers
are
worth
half
a
million
of
parisian
rioters
the
young
lieutenant
emboldened
to
be
the
mouthpiece
of
his
brother
officers
stopped
short
on
seeing
how
far
his
enthusiasm
had
carried
him
but
the
queen
had
caught
enough
to
feel
the
scope
of
his
outburst
do
you
know
the
state
of
affairs
sir
she
inquired
i
was
in
the
riots
yesterday
was
his
confused
reply
then
do
not
fear
to
speak
let
us
have
details
the
lieutenant
stepped
out
though
he
colored
up
my
lords
of
bezenval
and
lambesq
know
them
better
than
i
he
said
continue
young
sir
it
pleases
me
to
hear
them
from
you
under
whose
orders
are
these
forty
thousand
men
the
superiors
are
the
two
gentlemen
i
named
under
whom
rule
prince
conde
and
salkenaym
the
park
of
artillery
on
montmartre
could
lay
that
district
in
ashes
in
six
hours
at
its
signal
to
fire
vincennes
would
answer
from
four
quarters
as
many
corps
of
ten
thousand
troops
could
march
in
and
paris
would
not
hold
out
hours
this
is
plain
speaking
at
least
and
a
clear
plan
what
do
you
say
to
this
prince
lambesq
that
the
young
gentleman
is
a
perfect
general
at
least
he
is
a
soldier
who
does
not
despair
said
the
queen
seeing
the
lieutenant
turn
pale
with
anger
thank
your
majesty
replied
the
latter
i
do
not
know
what
your
majesty
will
decide
but
i
beg
her
to
count
me
with
the
other
forty
thousand
men
including
the
captains
as
ready
to
die
for
her
with
these
words
he
courteously
saluted
the
general
who
had
almost
insulted
him
this
courtesy
struck
the
queen
more
than
the
pledge
of
devotedness
your
name
sir
said
she
viscount
charny
he
responded
charny
repeated
marie
antoinette
blushing
in
spite
of
herself
any
relation
to
count
charny
i
am
his
brother
lady
bowing
more
lowly
than
before
i
might
have
known
that
you
were
one
of
my
most
faithful
servitors
said
she
recovering
from
her
tremor
and
looking
round
with
confidence
by
the
first
words
you
spoke
i
thank
you
viscount
how
comes
this
to
be
the
first
time
i
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
at
court
my
eldest
brother
head
of
the
family
ordered
me
to
stay
with
the
army
and
i
have
only
been
in
versailles
twice
during
seven
years
on
the
regimental
she
let
a
long
look
dwell
on
his
face
you
resemble
your
brother
she
remarked
i
shall
scold
him
for
having
waited
for
you
to
present
yourself
at
court
electrified
by
this
greeting
to
their
young
spokesman
the
officers
exaggerated
their
devotion
to
the
royal
cause
and
from
each
knot
burst
expressions
of
heroism
able
to
conquer
the
whole
of
france
these
cries
flattered
marie
antoinette
secret
aspirations
and
she
meant
to
profit
by
them
she
saw
herself
in
perspective
the
leader
of
an
immense
army
and
rejoiced
over
the
victory
against
the
civilians
who
dared
to
rebel
around
her
ladies
and
gentlemen
wild
with
youth
love
and
confidence
cheered
their
brilliant
hussars
heavy
dragoons
terrible
switzers
and
thunderous
cannoniers
and
laughed
at
the
spikes
fastened
on
without
dreaming
that
on
these
coarse
spears
were
to
be
carried
the
noblest
heads
of
the
realm
i
am
more
afraid
of
a
pike
than
a
musket
murmured
princess
lamballe
because
it
is
uglier
my
dear
therese
said
the
queen
but
you
need
not
be
alarmed
our
parisian
pikemen
are
not
worth
the
famous
spearmen
of
moat
and
the
good
swiss
of
this
day
carry
guns
much
superior
to
the
spears
of
their
forefathers
thank
god
they
can
fire
true
with
them
i
answer
for
that
said
bezenval
lady
polignac
disheartenment
had
no
effect
beyond
saddening
her
royal
mistress
the
enthusiasm
increased
among
the
rest
of
the
gathering
but
was
damped
when
the
king
coming
in
abruptly
called
for
his
supper
the
simple
word
chilled
the
assemblage
she
hoped
that
he
did
it
to
show
how
cool
he
was
but
in
fact
the
son
of
saint
louis
was
hungry
that
was
all
the
king
was
served
on
a
small
table
in
the
queen
while
she
was
trying
to
revive
the
fire
he
devoured
the
officers
did
not
think
this
gastronomical
exercise
worthy
of
a
hero
and
looked
on
as
little
respectful
as
they
dared
to
be
the
queen
blushed
and
her
fretfulness
was
displayed
in
all
her
movements
her
fine
nervy
and
aristocratic
nature
could
not
understand
the
rule
of
matter
over
mind
she
went
up
to
him
asking
what
orders
he
had
to
give
oh
orders
he
said
with
his
mouth
full
will
you
not
be
our
egeria
in
the
pinch
my
lord
numa
was
a
peaceful
king
but
at
present
we
think
a
belligerent
one
is
wanted
and
if
your
majesty
wants
to
model
himself
on
an
antique
pattern
be
romulus
if
not
tarquin
are
these
gentlemen
all
bellicose
too
he
asked
with
a
tranquillity
almost
beatific
but
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
with
the
animation
of
the
meal
and
they
thought
it
was
courage
yes
sire
war
they
chorussed
gentlemen
you
please
me
greatly
by
showing
that
i
may
rely
upon
you
in
case
of
need
but
i
have
a
council
and
an
appetite
the
former
advises
me
what
to
do
the
other
what
i
have
done
to
do
and
he
chuckled
while
he
handed
the
officer
of
the
king
mouth
the
picked
bones
and
chewed
rejecta
of
his
repast
on
the
napkin
a
murmur
of
choler
and
stupor
ran
through
the
ranks
of
the
nobles
who
were
eager
to
shed
their
blood
for
the
monarch
the
queen
turned
aside
and
stamped
her
foot
prince
lambesq
came
up
to
her
saying
your
majesty
sees
that
the
king
thinks
like
me
that
to
wait
is
the
best
course
it
is
prudence
and
though
not
my
strong
card
the
best
to
keep
in
hand
for
the
final
rubber
in
the
game
we
play
yes
my
lord
it
is
a
highly
necessary
virtue
replied
she
biting
her
lip
till
the
blood
came
she
was
roused
from
her
torpor
by
the
sweet
voice
of
countess
jules
polignar
who
came
up
with
her
diana
to
propose
that
as
she
and
her
party
were
hated
by
the
people
as
the
favorites
of
the
queen
they
should
be
allowed
to
go
out
of
the
kingdom
at
first
the
queen
would
not
hear
of
the
sacrifice
but
she
saw
that
fear
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
and
that
the
king
aunt
adelaide
had
suggested
it
you
are
right
she
answered
you
run
dangers
from
the
rage
of
a
people
who
are
uncurbed
i
can
not
accept
the
devotion
which
prompts
you
to
stay
i
wish
i
order
you
to
depart
she
was
choking
with
emotions
mastering
her
in
spite
of
her
heroism
when
the
king
voice
suddenly
sounded
in
her
ear
he
was
at
the
dessert
madam
he
said
some
one
is
in
your
rooms
to
see
you
i
am
told
sire
she
answered
abjuring
all
thoughts
but
of
royal
dignity
you
have
orders
to
give
here
are
lords
lambesq
bezenval
and
the
marshal
duke
broglie
what
orders
for
your
generals
what
do
you
think
of
this
matter
duke
he
inquired
hesitatingly
of
old
broglie
sire
if
you
retire
your
troops
the
parisians
will
say
they
daunted
them
if
you
let
them
stand
they
will
have
to
defeat
them
lambesq
shook
his
head
but
bezenval
and
the
queen
applauded
command
the
forward
march
went
on
the
duke
very
well
since
you
all
wish
it
let
it
be
march
said
the
king
but
at
this
moment
a
note
was
passed
to
the
queen
who
read
do
not
be
in
a
hurry
i
await
an
audience
it
was
count
writing
is
my
lord
charny
waiting
she
asked
of
the
messenger
yes
dusty
and
i
believe
bloody
with
hard
riding
please
to
await
me
a
moment
said
the
queen
to
broglie
and
the
others
as
she
hurried
into
her
private
apartments
chapter
xix
the
queen
favorite
on
entering
her
boudoir
the
queen
beheld
the
writer
of
the
missive
count
george
oliver
charny
was
a
tall
man
of
with
a
strong
countenance
warning
one
of
his
determination
his
bluish
grey
eyes
quick
and
piercing
as
the
eagle
his
straight
nose
and
his
marked
chin
all
gave
his
physiognomy
a
martial
expression
enhanced
by
the
dashing
elegance
with
which
he
wore
his
uniform
of
lieutenant
in
the
royal
lifeguards
his
hands
were
still
quivering
under
the
torn
lace
ruffles
his
sword
had
been
so
bent
as
to
fit
the
sheath
badly
he
was
pacing
the
room
a
prey
to
a
thousand
disquieting
thoughts
my
lord
charny
cried
marie
antoinette
going
straight
up
to
him
you
here
seeing
that
he
bowed
respectfully
according
to
the
regulations
however
she
dismissed
her
servant
who
shut
the
door
hardly
giving
it
the
time
to
close
the
lady
grasped
the
hand
with
force
and
said
why
have
you
come
here
count
because
i
believe
it
my
duty
no
your
duty
was
to
flee
from
versailles
to
do
as
agreed
to
obey
me
to
act
like
all
my
friends
who
are
afraid
of
my
ill
fortune
your
duty
is
to
sacrifice
nothing
for
me
to
keep
away
from
me
who
keeps
away
from
you
the
wise
whence
come
you
from
paris
boiling
with
excitement
intoxicated
and
bathed
in
blood
the
queen
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
alas
not
one
not
even
you
brings
me
good
news
from
that
quarter
in
such
a
time
ask
but
one
thing
of
the
messengers
truth
you
have
an
upright
soul
my
friend
a
brave
heart
do
not
tell
me
the
truth
at
present
for
mercy
sake
you
arrive
when
my
heart
is
breaking
for
the
first
time
my
friends
overwhelm
me
with
this
truthfulness
always
used
by
you
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
trifle
with
it
any
longer
it
flashes
out
in
everything
in
the
red
sky
the
air
filled
with
ominous
sounds
the
courtiers
faces
now
pale
and
serious
no
count
for
the
first
time
in
your
life
do
not
tell
me
the
truth
your
majesty
is
ailing
no
but
come
and
sit
beside
me
george
your
brow
is
burning
a
volcano
is
raging
there
your
hand
is
cold
for
she
was
pressing
it
between
hers
my
heart
has
been
touched
by
the
chill
of
death
he
replied
poor
george
i
told
you
we
had
best
forget
let
me
no
longer
be
the
queen
hated
and
threatened
but
just
the
woman
what
is
the
realm
the
universe
to
me
whom
one
loving
heart
suffices
the
count
went
down
on
one
knee
and
kissed
the
hem
of
her
dress
with
the
reverence
of
the
ancients
for
a
goddess
oh
count
my
only
friend
do
you
know
what
countess
diana
is
doing
leaving
the
country
returned
charny
he
guesses
rightly
muttered
the
queen
how
could
he
tell
that
oh
goodness
anything
can
be
surmised
at
this
hour
but
if
flight
is
so
natural
why
do
not
you
and
your
family
take
it
i
do
not
do
so
in
the
first
place
because
i
have
pledged
myself
not
only
to
your
majesty
but
to
myself
not
to
leave
you
during
the
storm
my
brothers
stay
as
they
regulate
their
movements
by
mine
and
my
wife
remains
because
she
loves
your
majesty
most
sincerely
i
believe
yes
andrea
has
a
most
noble
heart
said
the
lady
with
visible
coldness
that
is
why
she
will
not
quit
versailles
replied
charny
it
follows
that
i
shall
always
have
you
near
me
went
on
the
queen
in
the
same
glacial
tone
awarded
to
prevent
the
hearer
telling
whether
she
felt
disdain
or
jealousy
a
witness
could
have
divined
this
secret
however
from
their
manner
in
this
privacy
meeting
romantically
without
either
knowing
the
other
quality
marie
antoinette
and
george
charny
had
fallen
in
love
with
each
other
the
royal
dame
had
left
the
passion
swell
to
the
highest
point
when
the
king
had
surprised
the
pair
in
dangerous
intimacy
there
was
only
one
way
to
save
her
reputation
she
blurted
out
the
first
name
of
a
lady
that
occurred
to
her
and
protested
that
the
count
was
at
her
knees
sueing
for
this
lady
to
be
his
wife
with
the
royal
approval
the
queen
had
named
andrea
taverney
her
companion
and
the
king
his
suspicions
dismissed
consented
that
she
should
be
withdrawn
from
the
convent
where
she
had
taken
refuge
to
fulfill
the
pretendedly
wish
of
charny
was
it
religion
that
impelled
her
or
love
on
her
own
side
for
charny
it
was
love
for
she
eagerly
accepted
the
proffered
hand
and
the
wedding
took
place
all
the
more
as
she
had
had
the
misfortune
to
learn
that
she
was
used
as
the
cover
for
the
royal
amour
but
at
the
churchdoor
they
separated
and
had
dwelt
apart
ever
since
had
she
been
truly
a
wife
the
experiment
of
gilbert
might
have
failed
for
mesmerism
succeeds
best
with
the
single
your
majesty
resumed
the
count
made
me
lifeguards
lieutenant
at
versailles
and
i
should
not
have
quitted
my
post
only
you
ordered
me
to
guard
the
tuileries
palace
you
called
it
a
necessary
exile
your
majesty
knows
that
the
countess
neither
approved
nor
disapproved
as
she
was
not
consulted
true
observed
the
other
still
cold
i
now
believe
my
place
is
here
proceeded
the
officer
with
intrepidity
i
have
broken
my
orders
and
come
hoping
it
will
not
displease
you
whether
lady
charny
fears
the
course
of
events
and
goes
away
or
not
i
remain
by
the
queen
unless
you
break
my
sword
then
being
unable
to
die
in
your
presence
i
can
be
killed
at
your
door
or
on
the
pavement
without
he
spoke
so
royally
and
plainly
these
simple
words
straight
from
the
heart
that
the
sovereign
fell
from
her
high
pride
behind
which
she
had
hidden
a
feeling
more
human
than
royal
count
never
utter
that
word
never
say
you
will
die
for
me
as
i
feel
that
you
will
do
so
i
must
say
so
for
the
time
comes
when
those
who
love
monarchs
must
die
for
them
i
fear
so
what
gives
you
this
fatal
presentiment
my
lord
alas
returned
the
nobleman
at
the
time
of
the
american
war
i
was
fired
like
others
with
the
fever
of
independence
thrilling
society
i
also
wish
to
take
a
hand
in
the
liberation
of
the
slaves
of
great
britain
as
was
said
in
those
days
and
i
became
a
free
mason
an
invisible
like
the
lafayettes
and
lameths
under
the
redoubtable
balsamo
the
do
you
know
the
aim
of
that
secret
society
the
wrecking
of
thrones
its
motto
down
the
lilies
expressed
in
latin
as
pedibus
destrue
in
three
letters
for
the
initiated
i
retired
with
honor
when
i
learnt
this
but
for
one
who
shrank
twenty
took
the
oath
what
happens
is
merely
the
first
act
of
a
grand
tragedy
which
has
been
rehearsed
during
twenty
years
in
the
darkness
i
have
recognized
the
bounden
brothers
at
the
head
of
the
men
who
govern
at
the
city
hall
occupy
the
palais
royal
and
took
the
bastile
do
not
cheat
yourself
these
accomplished
deeds
are
no
accidents
but
revolution
planned
long
beforehand
do
you
believe
this
dear
friend
sobbed
marie
antoinette
do
not
weep
but
understand
said
the
count
understand
that
i
the
queen
born
mistress
of
thousands
of
men
subjects
created
to
obey
must
look
on
at
them
revolting
and
killing
my
friends
no
never
will
i
understand
this
you
must
madam
for
you
have
become
the
enemy
of
these
subjects
as
soon
as
obedience
weighed
upon
them
and
while
they
are
lacking
the
strength
to
devour
you
they
are
testing
their
teeth
on
your
friends
whom
they
detest
as
much
as
you
more
than
you
perhaps
you
think
they
are
right
master
philosopher
sneered
the
austrian
alas
yes
they
are
right
replied
the
lifeguards
lieutenant
in
his
bland
affectionate
voice
for
when
i
idly
rode
along
the
street
with
handsome
english
horses
in
a
suit
and
my
servants
wearing
more
gold
braid
than
would
have
kept
three
families
your
people
thousand
wretches
without
daily
bread
asked
me
to
my
teeth
what
use
was
i
who
set
up
as
a
man
above
his
you
serve
them
my
lord
said
the
queen
grasping
the
swordhilt
with
this
blade
which
your
fathers
used
as
heroes
on
many
a
celebrated
battlefield
the
french
nobility
shielded
the
masses
in
war
times
they
won
their
gold
by
losing
their
blood
do
not
you
ask
what
use
you
are
george
while
you
a
brave
man
swing
the
sword
of
your
fathers
do
not
speak
of
the
nobles
blood
returned
the
count
the
commoners
have
blood
to
shed
also
go
and
see
the
streams
of
it
on
bastile
square
go
and
count
their
dead
in
the
gutters
and
know
that
those
hearts
now
ceased
to
beat
throbbed
as
nobly
as
a
knight
when
your
cannon
thundered
against
them
they
sang
in
the
showers
of
grapeshot
while
handling
unfamiliar
weapons
and
the
oldest
grenadiers
would
not
make
a
charge
with
that
lightness
lady
and
queen
do
not
look
at
me
with
that
angry
eye
i
beseech
you
what
matters
to
the
heart
whether
it
is
clad
in
steel
or
rags
the
time
is
come
to
think
of
this
you
have
no
longer
millions
of
slaves
or
subjects
or
mere
men
in
france
but
soldiers
who
will
fight
against
me
yes
for
they
fight
for
liberty
and
you
stand
between
them
and
that
goddess
a
long
silence
succeeded
the
words
and
the
woman
was
first
to
break
it
you
have
spoken
the
truth
which
i
begged
you
to
keep
back
she
said
because
it
is
before
you
veiled
seen
distorted
but
there
you
may
sleep
to
forget
it
but
it
sits
on
your
bedside
and
it
will
be
the
phantom
in
your
dreams
as
it
is
the
reality
of
your
waking
moments
i
know
one
sleep
it
will
not
trouble
said
she
proudly
i
do
not
fear
that
kind
more
than
your
majesty
i
may
desire
it
as
much
said
the
count
oh
you
think
it
our
only
refuge
yes
but
we
must
not
hurry
towards
it
we
shall
earn
it
by
our
exertions
during
the
day
of
storm
they
were
sitting
beside
each
other
but
a
gulf
divided
them
their
thoughts
so
diverged
a
last
word
count
said
marie
antoinette
swear
to
me
that
you
came
back
solely
on
my
account
that
lady
charny
did
not
write
to
you
i
know
that
she
was
going
out
to
meet
you
swear
that
you
have
not
come
back
for
her
sake
at
this
was
heard
a
slight
tapping
at
the
door
it
was
the
servant
to
announce
that
the
king
had
finished
supper
charny
frowned
with
wonder
tell
his
majesty
said
the
queen
without
sitting
apart
from
her
favorite
that
i
have
news
from
the
capital
and
will
impart
to
him
continue
she
added
to
charny
the
king
having
supped
must
be
given
time
to
digest
this
interruption
had
not
weakened
the
woman
jealousy
as
a
loving
one
or
as
a
queen
your
majesty
asks
if
i
came
back
on
account
of
my
wife
he
asked
as
soon
as
the
door
was
closed
do
you
forget
that
i
am
a
man
of
my
word
and
the
engagement
i
made
it
is
the
oath
that
goads
me
for
in
immolating
yourself
to
my
happiness
you
give
grief
to
a
fair
and
noble
woman
a
crime
the
more
you
exaggerate
be
it
enough
that
i
keep
my
word
call
it
not
a
crime
what
was
born
of
chance
and
necessity
we
have
both
deplored
this
union
which
shielded
the
queen
good
fame
i
have
been
obliged
to
submit
to
it
these
four
years
yes
but
do
you
believe
that
i
do
not
see
your
sorrow
and
chagrin
translated
under
the
form
of
the
deepest
respect
reproached
the
queen
for
mercy
sake
do
me
justice
for
what
you
see
me
do
for
if
i
have
not
yet
suffered
and
made
others
suffer
enough
i
might
double
the
burden
without
rising
to
the
level
of
the
gratitude
i
owe
you
eternally
his
speech
had
irresistible
power
like
all
emanating
from
a
sincere
and
impassioned
heart
yes
yes
i
know
all
and
i
am
wrong
forgive
me
but
if
you
worship
some
secret
idol
to
whom
you
offer
a
mystic
incense
if
you
cherish
one
adored
woman
i
dare
not
utter
the
words
they
frighten
me
lest
the
syllables
should
scatter
through
the
air
and
vibrate
on
my
ear
oh
if
one
exists
keep
her
hidden
from
all
and
do
not
forget
that
you
have
a
fair
and
youthful
wife
who
should
be
publicly
encompassed
with
cares
and
assiduity
she
should
lean
on
your
arm
and
on
your
heart
charny
frowned
so
that
the
pure
lines
of
his
visage
were
altered
for
a
space
what
are
you
seeking
that
i
should
depart
from
the
countess
of
charny
you
are
silent
that
is
your
meaning
i
am
ready
to
obey
you
but
reflect
that
she
is
alone
in
the
world
andrea
is
an
orphan
her
father
the
baron
having
died
last
year
like
a
good
old
nobleman
of
the
former
time
who
did
not
wish
to
see
the
present
her
brother
the
knight
of
redcastle
only
appears
once
at
court
to
bow
to
your
majesty
kiss
his
sister
and
go
away
without
anybody
knowing
whither
reflect
madam
that
this
lady
of
charny
might
be
called
unto
god
as
a
maiden
without
the
purest
of
the
angels
surprising
in
her
mind
any
womanly
memory
yes
i
know
your
andrea
is
an
angel
on
earth
and
deserves
to
be
loved
that
is
why
i
think
the
future
will
be
hers
when
it
flees
from
me
no
no
but
i
am
not
speaking
like
a
queen
i
forget
myself
but
there
is
a
voice
in
my
heart
singing
of
love
and
happiness
while
without
roars
war
misery
and
death
it
is
the
voice
of
my
youth
which
i
have
outlived
forgive
one
charny
who
is
no
longer
young
and
will
smile
and
love
no
more
the
unhappy
woman
pressed
her
long
thin
fingers
to
her
burning
eyes
and
tears
regal
diamonds
more
becoming
than
the
finest
in
the
diamond
necklace
trickled
between
them
oh
order
me
to
quit
you
but
do
not
let
me
see
you
weep
pleaded
the
count
again
falling
on
one
knee
the
dream
is
over
said
marie
antoinette
rising
with
a
witching
movement
she
tossed
back
her
thick
powdered
tresses
unrolling
down
her
white
and
swanline
neck
i
shall
afflict
you
no
more
let
us
drop
such
folly
is
it
odd
that
a
woman
should
be
so
weak
when
a
queen
stands
in
such
need
of
comfort
let
us
talk
of
serious
matters
such
as
you
bear
from
paris
from
paris
madam
where
i
witnessed
the
ruin
of
royalty
this
is
serious
with
a
vengeance
you
call
a
successful
revolt
the
ruin
of
royalty
because
the
bastile
is
taken
lord
charny
do
you
say
royalty
is
abolished
you
do
not
reflect
that
the
bastile
has
been
built
but
in
the
fourteenth
century
while
royalty
struck
in
its
roots
six
thousand
years
ago
all
over
the
globe
i
would
i
could
deceive
said
the
lieutenant
sadly
and
proclaim
consoling
news
instead
of
saddening
your
majesty
unfortunately
the
instrument
gives
forth
no
other
sounds
than
it
was
shaped
to
send
stay
i
will
set
you
to
a
cheerier
tune
though
i
am
but
a
woman
you
say
the
parisians
have
revolted
in
what
proportion
twelve
out
of
fifteen
the
calculation
is
easy
the
populace
stand
in
that
proportion
to
the
classes
the
other
two
fifteenths
being
the
nobility
and
the
clergy
but
six
of
the
rate
are
women
and
women
and
children
are
not
the
least
of
your
foes
you
are
proud
and
courageous
yourself
do
not
omit
the
women
and
the
children
one
day
you
may
reckon
them
as
demons
what
do
you
mean
count
do
you
not
know
the
part
the
women
and
children
play
in
civil
commotions
i
will
tell
you
and
you
will
own
that
a
woman
is
equal
two
soldiers
are
you
mad
my
lord
had
you
seen
your
sex
at
the
taking
of
the
bastile
he
said
with
a
mournful
smile
hounding
the
men
on
to
arm
themselves
while
under
the
fire
threatening
with
their
naked
fist
your
swiss
soldiers
caparisoned
for
war
yelling
maledictions
over
the
slain
in
a
voice
which
made
the
living
bound
unto
death
had
you
seen
them
boiling
pitch
rolling
cannon
giving
the
fighting
men
cartridges
and
the
more
timid
a
kiss
with
the
cartridges
do
you
know
that
as
many
women
as
men
dashed
across
the
bastile
and
that
if
its
stones
are
coming
down
now
the
picks
are
wielded
by
female
hands
oh
my
lady
you
must
include
the
women
and
the
children
who
cast
the
bullets
sharpen
the
swords
and
hurl
from
the
roofs
the
bullet
cast
by
a
boy
will
kill
your
best
general
from
afar
the
sword
he
sharpened
will
hamstring
your
finest
the
blind
pebble
from
this
sling
will
put
out
the
eye
of
your
dragoon
samson
and
your
lifeguards
goliath
count
the
old
men
too
for
they
who
have
no
strength
to
swing
the
sabre
serve
as
buckler
for
the
active
fighters
at
the
taking
of
the
bastile
old
men
were
on
hand
they
stood
so
that
the
younger
ones
could
rest
their
guns
on
their
shoulder
so
that
the
balls
of
your
switzers
might
be
buried
in
the
useless
old
body
the
rampart
of
the
able
man
include
them
among
your
foes
for
they
have
been
relating
in
the
chimney
corner
for
ever
so
many
years
what
affronts
their
mothers
endured
the
poverty
of
the
estates
over
which
the
nobles
hunted
the
shame
of
their
caste
humbled
under
feudal
privileges
when
the
sons
took
up
the
gun
they
found
it
loaded
with
the
curses
of
the
aged
as
well
as
with
powder
and
shot
in
paris
now
women
and
children
as
well
as
the
men
are
cheering
for
liberty
and
independence
count
them
all
as
eight
hundred
thousand
warriors
three
hundred
spartans
vanquished
xerxes
army
retorted
the
queen
yes
but
the
spartans
are
nearly
a
million
and
it
is
your
army
that
is
xerxes
oh
i
would
rather
be
hurled
from
the
throne
she
cried
as
she
rose
with
clenched
fists
and
face
flaming
with
shame
and
ire
i
would
rather
your
parisians
hewed
me
to
pieces
than
hear
from
a
charny
one
of
my
supporters
such
speech
as
this
charny
would
not
so
address
your
majesty
unless
every
drop
of
blood
in
his
veins
were
worthy
of
his
sires
and
given
to
you
then
let
us
march
upon
paris
and
let
us
die
together
shamefully
without
any
battle
said
the
noble
we
shall
not
fight
but
disappear
entirely
like
philistines
march
on
paris
when
as
soon
as
we
enter
within
her
walls
all
the
houses
will
tumble
down
upon
us
like
the
red
sea
waves
overwhelming
pharaoh
and
you
will
leave
a
cursed
name
and
your
children
will
be
hunted
down
like
how
must
i
fall
pray
tell
me
count
demanded
the
sovereign
haughtily
teach
me
as
a
victim
was
the
answer
like
a
christian
queen
smiling
and
forgiving
those
who
strike
you
if
i
had
five
hundred
thousand
like
myself
i
might
say
let
us
have
at
them
this
night
and
you
would
sleep
in
the
tuileries
the
throne
conquered
woe
is
me
you
despair
on
whom
was
set
my
final
hope
i
despair
because
all
france
thinks
like
paris
and
your
army
if
victorious
in
the
capital
will
be
engulfed
by
the
other
towns
have
courage
enough
my
lady
to
sheathe
the
sword
is
this
why
i
have
gathered
brave
men
around
me
why
i
breathed
courage
into
them
wailed
the
queen
if
you
are
not
of
my
opinion
madam
order
and
we
march
at
once
to
paris
speak
so
much
devotion
was
in
this
offer
that
the
hearer
was
appalled
she
threw
herself
disconsolate
on
a
sofa
where
she
struggled
for
a
long
time
with
her
pride
count
she
said
at
length
i
shall
remain
inactive
as
you
desire
i
am
not
cross
though
i
have
one
thing
to
scold
you
for
i
only
learn
by
chance
that
you
have
a
brother
in
the
military
service
valence
is
in
bercheny
hussars
yes
madam
why
have
you
never
spoken
of
the
young
man
he
deserves
a
higher
grade
in
the
regiment
he
is
young
and
inexperienced
he
is
not
fit
to
command
if
your
majesty
deigned
to
lower
your
view
upon
me
a
charny
that
is
no
reason
for
me
to
elevate
my
family
at
the
expense
of
brave
gentlemen
worthier
than
brothers
of
mine
you
have
other
brothers
isidore
is
another
two
ready
to
die
for
your
majesty
does
he
need
nothing
nothing
we
are
lucky
enough
to
place
not
merely
life
but
wealth
at
your
majesty
feet
as
he
spoke
the
queen
thrilled
with
this
delicate
probity
a
moan
from
the
next
room
aroused
them
rising
the
queen
ran
to
the
door
opened
it
and
screamed
loudly
she
saw
a
woman
writhing
on
the
carpet
in
dreadful
spasms
it
is
the
countess
your
wife
she
faltered
can
she
have
overheard
us
no
said
he
otherwise
she
would
have
let
us
know
that
she
could
hear
us
he
sprang
towards
andrea
and
caught
her
up
in
his
arms
two
paces
off
the
queen
stood
pale
and
cold
but
trembling
with
anxiety
chapter
xx
the
trio
of
love
without
knowing
who
was
helping
her
andrea
began
to
recover
consciousness
but
instinctively
she
knew
help
had
come
at
length
with
open
but
ghostly
eyes
she
stared
at
charny
without
yet
recognizing
him
she
pushed
him
away
with
a
scream
then
the
queen
averted
her
eyes
although
she
ought
to
have
played
the
woman
part
of
comforter
she
cast
off
her
sister
instead
of
supporting
her
pardon
her
my
lady
said
charny
again
taking
his
wife
in
his
strong
arms
but
something
out
of
the
way
causes
this
my
lady
is
not
subject
to
fainting
fits
and
this
is
i
believe
the
first
time
she
has
had
one
in
your
presence
she
must
have
felt
much
pain
returned
the
queen
going
back
to
her
first
impression
that
andrea
had
overheard
them
no
doubt
said
the
count
and
you
might
let
me
have
her
carried
to
her
own
rooms
the
queen
rang
a
bell
but
at
the
first
tinkle
andrea
stiffened
in
a
culvulsion
and
screamed
in
delirium
oh
our
gilbert
the
queen
shuddered
to
hear
the
name
and
the
astonished
count
placed
his
wife
on
a
sofa
the
servant
who
ran
at
the
call
was
dismissed
queen
and
nobleman
looked
at
each
other
as
the
sufferer
seemed
with
closed
eyes
to
have
another
fit
charny
kneeling
by
her
had
hard
work
to
keep
her
on
the
lounge
i
think
i
know
this
name
said
marie
antoinette
from
its
not
being
the
first
time
the
countess
has
used
it
but
as
though
the
recollection
was
a
menace
andrea
opened
her
eyes
and
made
an
effort
by
which
she
stood
up
her
first
intelligent
glance
was
fondly
upon
charny
who
was
now
upright
as
if
this
involuntary
manifestation
of
her
mind
was
unworthy
her
spartan
soul
she
turned
her
gaze
only
to
meet
the
queen
she
bowed
at
once
good
heavens
what
is
the
matter
inquired
the
count
you
alarm
me
for
you
are
usually
so
brave
and
strong
to
be
prey
to
such
a
swoon
such
dreadful
things
have
happened
at
paris
where
you
were
that
if
men
are
trembling
at
them
women
may
be
excused
for
fainting
i
am
so
glad
you
came
away
from
the
city
is
it
on
my
account
that
you
felt
so
ill
queried
the
noble
why
certainly
count
said
marie
antoinette
as
the
lady
made
no
sound
why
do
you
doubt
it
the
countess
is
not
a
queen
she
has
a
right
to
be
afraid
for
those
she
loves
oh
madam
rejoined
charny
perceiving
jealousy
in
the
slur
i
am
sure
that
the
countess
feels
more
fear
for
her
sovereign
than
for
herself
still
why
do
we
find
you
in
the
swoon
in
the
next
room
inquired
the
royal
lady
i
can
not
tell
for
i
am
ignorant
but
in
this
life
of
fatigue
and
terror
led
these
three
days
a
woman
fainting
is
natural
enough
meseems
true
said
the
queen
knowing
that
andrea
could
not
be
driven
out
of
her
defenses
for
that
matter
your
majesty
has
weeping
eyes
retorted
the
countess
with
that
recovered
calmness
which
was
the
more
embarrassing
as
it
was
pure
effort
of
her
will
and
was
felt
to
be
a
screen
over
her
real
feelings
charny
thought
he
perceived
the
same
ironical
tone
that
had
marked
the
queen
speaking
a
while
ago
it
is
not
astonishing
reproved
he
with
slight
sternness
to
which
his
voice
was
unaccustomed
that
a
queen
should
weep
who
loves
her
people
and
knows
that
their
blood
had
flowed
happily
god
hath
spared
yours
said
andrea
as
coldly
and
impenetrably
as
ever
but
her
majesty
is
not
in
question
we
are
talking
about
you
you
have
been
frightened
i
frightened
you
can
not
deny
you
were
in
pain
has
some
mishap
befallen
you
is
there
anybody
you
want
to
complain
of
this
gilbert
whom
you
mentioned
for
example
did
i
utter
that
name
said
andrea
with
such
a
tone
of
dread
that
the
count
was
more
startled
by
the
outcry
than
by
the
swoon
strange
for
i
did
not
know
it
till
the
king
mentioned
it
as
that
of
a
learned
physician
freshly
arrived
from
america
i
believe
and
who
was
friendly
there
with
general
lafayette
they
say
he
is
a
very
honorable
man
concluded
andrea
with
perfect
simplicity
then
why
this
emotion
my
dear
said
the
queen
you
spoke
this
gilbert
name
as
though
it
were
wrung
from
you
by
torture
very
likely
when
i
went
into
the
royal
study
i
beheld
a
stern
man
clad
in
the
grim
black
who
was
narrating
the
most
sombre
and
horrid
things
with
frightful
realism
the
murders
of
flesselles
and
launay
i
was
frightened
and
dropped
insensible
i
may
have
spoken
in
my
spell
and
the
name
of
gilbert
would
be
uttered
it
is
likely
said
charny
evidently
disposed
to
let
the
discussion
drop
at
least
you
are
recovered
now
completely
i
have
only
one
thing
to
entreat
said
the
queen
to
her
lifeguardsman
go
and
tell
the
generals
to
camp
where
their
troops
are
stationed
and
the
king
will
issue
orders
the
count
bowed
but
darted
an
affectionately
anxious
look
on
andrea
which
the
queen
remarked
will
you
not
return
to
the
king
with
me
inquired
she
of
the
countess
oh
no
replied
the
latter
eagerly
i
beg
leave
to
retire
oh
the
king
has
been
pleasant
but
you
would
rather
not
see
him
again
i
understand
you
may
go
and
let
the
count
carry
out
his
instructions
she
glanced
at
the
lord
as
much
as
to
say
return
soon
and
his
look
replied
as
soon
as
possible
andrea
with
a
heaving
and
oppressed
bosom
watched
her
movements
but
as
soon
as
he
had
disappeared
her
forces
failed
her
and
the
queen
had
to
run
to
her
with
the
smelling
salts
as
she
sank
on
a
stool
apologizing
for
the
breach
of
etiquette
in
sitting
in
the
royal
presence
the
feeling
between
the
pair
was
strange
the
queen
seemed
to
have
affection
for
her
attendant
and
the
latter
respect
for
her
mistress
but
they
were
like
enemies
at
times
you
know
dear
countess
that
etiquette
is
not
made
for
you
but
you
have
nothing
to
say
to
me
about
this
gilbert
whose
sight
made
so
profound
an
impression
on
you
the
woman
had
reflected
in
an
instant
whatever
the
relation
between
the
queen
who
was
suspected
of
having
paramours
and
the
king
perhaps
not
so
gullible
as
he
looked
marie
antoinette
might
draw
from
her
royal
consort
the
particulars
of
the
mesmeric
trance
in
which
gilbert
had
thrown
the
lady
of
charny
better
her
relation
than
the
king
with
the
energy
of
lunacy
she
ran
from
one
door
to
another
fastened
them
all
and
when
assured
that
nobody
could
hear
or
see
she
flung
herself
on
her
knees
before
her
mistress
save
me
in
heaven
name
save
me
she
wailed
and
i
will
tell
you
everything
chapter
xxi
the
queen
and
her
master
andrea
confession
was
a
long
one
for
it
was
not
until
eleven
at
night
that
the
royal
boudoir
door
opened
and
on
the
sill
was
seen
the
countess
of
charny
kissing
her
mistress
hand
she
went
away
with
weeping
eyes
but
the
queen
were
scorching
as
she
paced
her
room
she
gave
order
that
she
was
to
be
disturbed
on
no
account
unless
for
news
from
paris
at
the
supposition
that
charny
had
at
last
perceived
that
his
wife
was
still
young
and
fair
the
queen
found
that
misfortune
is
nothing
to
a
but
in
the
midst
of
her
feverish
torment
came
the
cruel
consolation
according
to
andrea
confession
she
had
been
wronged
in
a
mesmeric
trance
and
gilbert
had
humbled
her
pride
forever
somewhere
was
the
visible
token
of
her
defeat
like
a
trophy
of
his
shameful
triumph
the
young
man
had
borne
away
in
the
wintry
night
the
offspring
of
the
occult
love
of
the
gardener
boy
for
his
suzerain
daughter
she
could
not
but
be
wonderstricken
at
the
magical
combination
of
wayward
fortune
by
which
a
peasant
lad
had
been
made
to
love
the
fine
lady
who
was
to
be
the
favorite
of
the
queen
of
france
so
the
grain
of
dust
has
been
lifted
up
to
glitter
like
the
diamond
in
the
lustre
of
the
skies
she
mused
was
not
this
lowborn
lover
the
living
symbol
of
what
was
happening
at
the
time
a
man
of
the
people
swaying
the
politics
of
a
great
empire
one
who
personified
by
privilege
of
the
evil
spirit
who
soared
over
france
the
insult
to
its
nobility
and
the
attack
on
royalty
by
the
plebeians
while
shuddering
she
wanted
to
look
upon
this
monster
who
by
a
crime
had
infused
his
base
blood
into
the
aristocratic
blue
who
had
caused
a
revolution
that
he
should
be
delivered
from
the
castle
it
was
his
principles
which
had
armed
billet
gonchon
marat
and
the
others
he
was
a
venomous
creature
and
terrible
for
he
had
ruined
andrea
as
her
lover
and
wrecked
the
bastile
as
the
hater
of
kings
she
ought
to
know
him
to
avoid
him
or
the
better
to
fight
him
better
still
to
make
use
of
him
at
any
price
she
must
see
him
and
judge
him
two
thirds
of
the
night
were
passed
in
reverie
before
she
sank
into
troubled
slumber
but
even
here
the
revolution
was
her
nightmare
she
had
a
dream
that
she
was
walking
in
one
of
her
german
forests
when
a
gnome
seized
her
from
behind
a
tree
and
she
knew
that
it
was
gilbert
she
shrieked
and
waking
found
lady
tourzel
an
attendant
by
her
pillow
the
queen
is
sick
she
called
out
fetch
the
doctor
what
doctor
is
in
waiting
asked
the
queen
gilbert
the
new
honorary
physician
whom
the
king
has
appointed
you
speak
as
if
you
knew
him
and
yet
he
has
only
been
a
week
in
this
country
from
america
and
only
a
day
out
of
the
bastile
your
majesty
i
read
his
writings
and
i
was
so
curious
to
see
the
author
said
the
lady
that
i
had
him
pointed
out
to
me
as
he
was
in
his
rooms
ah
well
let
him
begin
his
duties
tell
him
i
am
ailing
and
request
his
presence
surprised
and
profoundly
affected
though
he
seemed
but
a
little
uneasy
gilbert
appeared
before
the
queen
with
her
aristocratic
intelligence
she
read
that
he
felt
timid
respect
for
the
woman
tranquil
audacity
for
the
patient
and
no
emotion
whatever
for
the
sovereign
she
was
vexed
too
that
he
could
look
so
well
in
the
black
suit
worn
by
the
third
class
of
society
and
one
the
revolutionists
chose
the
less
provoking
he
was
in
bearing
the
more
her
anger
grew
she
had
fancied
the
man
an
odious
character
one
of
the
heroes
of
impudence
whom
she
had
often
seen
around
her
she
had
represented
as
a
mirabeau
the
man
she
hated
next
to
cardinal
rohan
and
general
lafayette
this
author
of
andrea
woes
he
was
guilty
in
her
eyes
for
looking
the
gentleman
the
proud
austrian
conceived
a
wild
hatred
against
one
whom
she
thought
had
stolen
the
semblance
of
the
rank
he
had
no
business
to
aspire
to
as
he
had
not
ceased
to
look
at
her
while
she
was
dismissing
all
her
ladies
his
persistency
exasperated
her
like
importunity
well
sir
she
snapped
at
him
like
a
what
are
you
doing
in
staring
at
me
instead
of
telling
what
ails
me
this
furious
apostrophe
accompanied
with
visual
lightning
would
have
blasted
any
courtier
into
dropping
at
her
feet
and
sueing
for
mercy
though
he
was
a
hero
a
marshal
or
a
demigod
but
gilbert
made
answer
quietly
the
physician
judges
by
the
eyes
in
the
first
place
my
lady
as
your
majesty
summoned
me
i
come
not
from
idle
curiosity
but
to
obey
your
orders
and
fulfill
my
duty
as
far
as
in
my
power
lays
i
study
your
majesty
am
i
sick
not
in
the
usual
meaning
of
the
word
but
your
majesty
is
superexcited
why
not
say
i
am
out
of
temper
she
queried
with
irony
allow
me
to
use
the
medical
term
since
i
am
a
medical
man
called
in
be
it
so
whence
this
superexcitement
your
majesty
is
too
intelligent
not
to
know
that
a
man
of
medicine
only
judges
the
material
state
he
is
not
a
wizard
to
sound
at
the
first
glance
the
mind
of
man
do
you
mean
to
imply
that
at
the
second
or
third
time
you
could
not
merely
tell
me
my
bodily
ail
but
a
mental
one
possibly
returned
gilbert
coldly
she
darted
at
him
a
withering
look
while
he
was
simply
staring
at
her
with
desperate
fixedness
vanquished
she
tried
to
wrench
herself
away
from
what
was
alarming
while
fascinating
and
she
upset
a
stand
so
that
a
chocolate
cup
was
smashed
on
the
floor
he
saw
it
fall
and
the
cup
shiver
but
did
not
budge
the
color
flew
to
her
brow
to
which
she
carried
her
chilly
hand
but
she
dared
not
direct
her
eyes
again
on
the
magnetizer
under
what
master
did
you
study
she
inquired
using
a
scornful
tone
more
painful
than
insolence
i
can
not
answer
without
wounding
your
majesty
the
queen
felt
that
he
gave
her
an
advantage
and
she
leaped
in
at
the
opening
like
a
lioness
on
a
prey
wound
me
she
almost
screamed
i
vow
that
you
mistake
gilbert
you
have
not
studied
the
french
language
in
as
good
sources
as
medicine
i
fear
members
of
my
class
are
not
wounded
by
inferiors
only
tired
excuse
me
madam
he
returned
i
forgot
i
was
called
in
to
a
patient
you
are
about
to
stifle
with
excitement
and
i
shall
call
your
women
to
put
you
to
bed
she
walked
up
and
down
the
room
infuriated
at
being
treated
like
a
great
child
and
turning
said
you
are
gilbert
strange
i
have
a
girlish
memory
of
one
of
your
name
a
boy
who
looked
unkempt
tattered
and
torn
like
a
little
jean
jacques
rousseau
when
a
vagabond
who
was
delving
the
ground
with
the
spade
held
in
his
dirty
crooked
hands
it
was
i
replied
the
other
calmly
it
was
in
that
the
little
gardener
boy
to
whom
you
kindly
allude
was
earning
his
bread
by
working
in
the
royal
gardens
of
trianon
that
is
seventeen
years
ago
and
much
has
happened
in
that
time
it
needed
no
longer
to
make
the
wild
boy
a
learned
man
revolutionary
eras
are
the
of
mind
clear
as
your
glance
is
your
majesty
does
not
see
that
the
youth
is
a
man
of
thirty
it
is
wrong
to
be
astonished
that
little
gilbert
simple
and
uncouth
should
have
become
a
learned
philosopher
in
the
breath
of
two
revolutions
simple
perhaps
we
will
recur
to
that
on
another
occasion
said
the
queen
vindictively
but
let
us
have
to
do
with
the
learned
philosopher
the
improved
and
perfect
man
whom
i
have
under
my
eyes
gilbert
did
not
notice
the
sneer
though
he
knew
it
was
a
fresh
insult
you
are
appointed
medical
attendant
to
the
king
she
continued
it
is
clear
that
i
have
the
welfare
of
my
husband
too
near
my
heart
to
entrust
his
health
to
a
stranger
i
offered
myself
madam
responded
gilbert
and
his
majesty
accepted
me
without
any
doubts
on
my
capacity
and
zeal
i
am
mainly
a
political
physician
vouched
for
by
minister
necker
but
if
the
king
has
need
of
my
knowledge
of
the
scalpel
and
drugs
i
can
be
as
good
a
healer
as
human
science
allows
one
of
our
race
to
be
but
the
king
most
wants
besides
the
good
adviser
and
physician
a
good
friend
you
a
friend
of
the
king
exclaimed
the
lady
with
a
new
outbreak
of
scorn
by
virtue
of
your
quackery
and
charms
have
we
gone
back
to
the
dark
ages
and
are
you
going
to
rule
france
with
elixirs
and
jugglery
like
a
faust
i
have
no
pretentions
that
way
oh
why
have
you
given
that
branch
you
might
in
the
same
way
as
you
sent
andrea
to
sleep
put
the
monsters
under
a
spell
who
howl
and
spit
fire
on
our
threshold
this
time
gilbert
could
not
help
blushing
at
the
allusion
to
mesmerizing
andrea
which
was
of
inexpressible
delight
to
her
who
baited
him
as
she
believed
she
had
left
a
wound
for
you
can
send
people
to
sleep
she
pursued
you
no
doubt
have
studied
magnetism
with
those
villains
who
make
slumber
a
treacherous
weapon
and
read
our
secrets
in
our
sleep
indeed
madam
i
have
studied
magnetism
under
the
wise
cagliostro
that
teacher
of
moral
theft
who
taught
his
disciples
how
to
rifle
bodies
and
souls
by
his
infamous
practice
gilbert
understood
all
by
this
and
she
shuddered
with
joy
to
the
core
at
seeing
him
lose
color
wretch
she
rejoiced
i
have
stung
him
to
the
quick
and
the
blood
flows
but
the
deepest
emotions
did
not
long
hold
the
mesmerizer
in
their
spell
approaching
the
queen
who
was
rash
enough
to
look
up
in
her
triumph
and
let
her
eyes
be
caught
he
said
you
are
wrong
to
judge
so
harshly
you
denounce
cagliostro
as
a
quack
when
you
had
a
proof
of
his
real
science
when
you
were
the
archduchess
of
austria
and
first
came
to
france
when
i
saw
you
at
taverney
did
not
that
whom
you
decry
show
to
your
majesty
in
a
clear
cup
of
water
such
a
picture
of
your
fate
that
you
swooned
away
gilbert
had
not
seen
the
forecast
but
he
knew
from
his
master
no
doubt
what
marie
antoinette
had
been
shown
he
struck
so
hard
that
she
turned
dreadfully
pale
yes
she
said
in
a
hoarse
voice
he
showed
me
a
hideous
machine
of
bloodshed
but
i
do
not
yet
know
that
such
a
thing
exists
i
know
not
that
but
he
can
not
be
denied
the
rank
of
sage
who
held
such
might
over
his
his
fellows
sneered
the
queen
nay
his
power
was
so
great
that
crowned
heads
sank
beneath
his
level
went
on
gilbert
shame
i
tell
you
that
cagliostro
was
a
cowardly
charlatan
and
his
mesmeric
sleep
a
crime
in
one
case
it
resulted
in
a
deed
for
which
human
justice
represented
by
me
shall
seize
the
author
and
punish
him
madam
be
indulgent
for
those
who
have
sinned
ho
ho
you
confess
then
she
thought
by
the
gentleness
of
his
tone
that
he
was
imploring
her
mercy
some
forgot
herself
and
looked
at
him
to
scorch
him
with
her
indignation
but
her
glance
crossed
his
only
to
melt
like
a
steel
blade
on
which
the
electric
fluid
falls
and
she
felt
her
hatred
change
to
fright
while
she
recoiled
a
step
to
elude
coming
wrath
ah
madam
do
you
understand
what
the
power
is
i
had
from
the
master
whom
you
defamed
believe
that
if
i
were
not
the
most
respectful
of
your
subjects
i
could
convince
you
by
a
terrible
experiment
i
might
constrain
you
to
write
down
with
your
own
hands
lines
that
would
convince
you
when
you
read
them
at
your
release
from
the
charm
but
mark
how
solid
is
the
patience
and
the
generosity
of
the
man
whom
you
have
been
insulting
and
whom
you
placed
in
the
bastile
you
regret
it
was
broken
open
because
he
was
released
by
the
people
and
you
will
hate
me
and
continue
to
doubt
when
i
relax
the
bond
with
which
i
hold
you
ceasing
to
govern
her
with
glances
and
magnetic
passes
he
allowed
her
to
regain
some
like
the
bird
in
the
vacuum
to
whom
a
little
air
is
restored
send
me
to
sleep
force
me
to
speak
or
write
while
cried
the
queen
white
with
terror
have
you
dared
do
you
know
that
your
threat
is
a
crime
punishable
with
death
do
not
cry
out
too
soon
if
i
thus
charmed
you
and
forced
you
to
betray
your
inmost
secrets
it
would
be
with
a
witness
by
he
would
repeat
your
revelations
so
as
to
leave
you
no
doubt
a
witness
but
think
sir
that
a
witness
to
such
a
deed
would
be
an
accomplice
a
husband
is
not
the
accomplice
to
an
experiment
he
favors
on
his
wife
the
king
screamed
marie
antoinette
with
dread
revealing
rather
the
wife
than
the
medium
reluctant
to
make
a
scene
for
the
spiritualist
fie
dr
gilbert
the
king
your
natural
defender
your
sustainer
replied
gilbert
quietly
he
would
relate
when
you
were
awakened
how
respectful
i
was
while
proud
in
proving
my
science
on
the
most
venerated
of
sovereigns
he
left
her
to
meditate
on
the
depth
of
his
words
i
see
she
said
at
length
you
must
be
a
mortal
enemy
or
a
proven
friend
impossible
friendship
can
not
dwell
beside
fear
or
distrust
between
subject
and
monarch
friendship
can
not
live
but
on
the
confidence
the
subject
inspires
i
have
made
the
vow
not
to
use
my
weapons
but
to
repulse
the
wrongs
done
me
all
for
defense
nothing
for
offence
alas
moaned
the
queen
i
see
that
you
set
a
trap
after
frightening
the
woman
you
seek
to
rule
the
queen
no
lady
i
am
not
a
paltry
speculator
you
are
the
first
woman
in
whom
i
have
found
all
feminine
passions
with
all
the
dominant
faculties
of
man
you
can
be
a
woman
and
a
friend
i
admire
you
and
would
serve
you
i
will
do
it
without
receiving
aught
from
you
merely
to
study
you
i
will
do
more
to
show
you
how
i
serve
you
if
i
am
in
the
way
send
me
forth
send
you
hence
said
she
with
gladness
but
no
doubt
you
will
reflect
that
my
power
can
be
exercised
from
afar
it
is
true
but
do
not
fear
i
shall
not
employ
it
the
queen
was
musing
unable
to
reply
to
this
strange
man
when
steps
were
heard
in
the
corridor
the
king
she
exclaimed
then
point
out
the
door
by
which
i
may
depart
without
being
seen
by
him
stay
she
said
he
bowed
and
remained
impassible
while
she
sought
to
read
on
his
brow
to
what
point
triumph
rose
in
him
more
plain
than
anger
or
disquiet
at
least
he
might
have
shown
his
delight
she
thought
chapter
xxii
the
private
council
louis
entered
briskly
but
heavily
as
was
his
wont
his
manner
was
busy
and
curious
strongly
contrasting
with
the
queen
cold
rigidity
his
high
color
had
not
left
him
an
early
riser
and
proud
of
the
heartiness
he
had
imbibed
with
the
morning
breeze
he
breathed
noisily
and
set
his
foot
vigorously
on
the
floor
the
doctor
what
has
become
of
the
doctor
he
inquired
good
morning
sire
how
do
you
feel
this
morning
are
you
tired
i
have
slept
six
hours
my
allowance
i
feel
very
well
and
my
head
is
clear
but
you
are
a
little
pale
i
heard
you
had
sent
for
the
new
doctor
here
is
gilbert
said
the
queen
standing
aside
from
a
window
recess
where
the
doctor
had
been
screened
by
the
curtains
but
were
you
unwell
that
you
sent
for
him
continued
the
monarch
you
blush
you
must
have
some
secret
since
you
consult
him
instead
of
the
regular
doctors
of
the
household
but
have
a
care
gilbert
is
one
of
my
confidential
friends
and
if
you
tell
him
anything
he
will
repeat
it
to
me
the
queen
had
become
purple
from
being
merely
red
nay
sire
said
gilbert
smiling
what
has
the
queen
corrupted
my
friends
marie
antoinette
laughed
one
of
those
dry
laughs
signifying
that
the
conversation
has
gone
far
enough
or
it
fatigues
gilbert
understood
but
the
king
did
not
come
doctor
since
this
amuses
the
queen
let
me
hear
the
joke
i
was
asking
the
doctor
why
you
called
him
so
early
i
own
that
his
presence
at
versailles
much
puzzles
me
said
the
queen
i
was
wanting
the
doctor
to
talk
politics
with
him
said
louis
his
brow
darkening
oh
very
well
said
she
taking
a
seat
as
if
to
listen
but
we
are
not
going
to
talk
pleasant
stuff
so
we
must
go
away
to
spare
you
an
additional
pang
do
you
call
business
matters
pangs
majestically
said
the
queen
i
would
like
you
to
stay
gilbert
surely
you
will
not
disobey
me
but
i
want
the
doctor
opinion
and
he
can
not
give
it
according
to
his
conscience
if
you
are
by
us
what
risk
does
he
run
of
displeasing
me
by
speaking
according
to
his
conscience
she
demanded
that
is
easy
to
understand
madam
you
have
your
own
line
of
policy
which
is
not
always
ours
so
you
would
clearly
imply
that
the
gilbert
policy
runs
counter
to
mine
it
should
be
so
from
the
ideas
your
majesty
knows
me
to
entertain
said
gilbert
but
your
majesty
should
know
that
i
will
speak
the
truth
before
you
as
plainly
as
to
his
majesty
that
is
a
gain
said
marie
antoinette
truth
is
not
always
good
to
speak
observed
the
monarch
when
useful
suggested
gilbert
and
the
intention
good
added
the
queen
we
do
not
doubt
that
said
king
louis
but
if
you
are
wise
madam
you
will
leave
the
doctor
free
use
of
his
language
which
i
stand
in
need
of
sire
since
the
queen
provokes
the
truth
and
i
know
her
mind
is
too
noble
and
powerful
to
dread
it
i
prefer
to
speak
before
both
my
sovereigns
i
ask
it
i
have
faith
in
your
majesty
wisdom
said
gilbert
bowing
to
the
lady
the
question
turns
on
the
king
glory
and
happiness
then
you
were
right
to
have
faith
in
me
commence
sir
well
i
advise
the
king
to
go
to
paris
a
spark
dropping
into
the
eight
thousand
pounds
of
gunpowder
in
the
city
hall
cellars
would
not
have
caused
the
explosion
of
this
sentence
in
the
queen
bosom
there
said
the
king
who
had
been
startled
by
her
cry
i
told
you
so
doctor
the
king
proceeded
the
indignant
woman
in
a
city
revolted
among
scythes
and
pitchforks
borne
by
the
villains
who
massacred
the
swiss
and
murdered
count
launay
and
provost
flesselles
the
king
crossing
the
city
hall
square
and
slipping
in
the
blood
of
his
defenders
you
are
insane
to
speak
thus
sir
gilbert
lowered
his
eyes
as
in
respect
but
said
not
a
word
the
king
writhed
in
his
chair
as
though
on
a
red
hot
grid
madam
said
the
doctor
at
last
i
have
seen
paris
and
you
have
not
even
been
out
of
the
palace
to
see
versailles
do
you
know
what
paris
is
about
storming
some
other
bastile
jeered
the
queen
assuredly
not
but
paris
knows
there
is
another
fortress
between
it
and
the
king
the
city
is
collecting
the
deputies
of
its
wards
and
sending
them
here
let
them
come
said
the
queen
with
fierce
joy
they
will
be
hotly
received
take
care
madam
for
they
come
not
alone
but
escorted
by
twenty
thousand
national
guards
what
is
that
do
not
speak
lightly
of
an
institution
which
will
be
a
power
one
day
it
will
bind
and
unbind
my
lord
you
have
ten
thousand
men
who
are
equal
to
these
twenty
thousand
said
the
queen
call
them
up
to
give
these
blackguards
their
chastisement
and
the
example
which
all
this
revolutionary
spawn
has
need
of
i
would
sweep
them
all
away
in
a
week
if
i
were
listened
to
how
deceived
you
are
by
others
said
gilbert
shaking
his
head
sadly
alas
think
of
civil
war
excited
by
a
queen
only
one
did
so
and
she
went
down
to
the
grave
with
the
epithet
of
the
foreigner
excited
by
me
what
do
you
mean
did
i
fire
on
the
bastile
without
provocation
pray
instead
of
urging
violence
hearken
to
reason
interposed
the
king
continue
he
said
to
gilbert
spare
the
king
a
battle
with
doubtful
issue
these
hates
which
grow
hotter
at
a
distance
these
boastings
which
become
courage
on
occasion
you
may
by
gentleness
soften
the
contact
of
this
army
with
the
palace
let
the
king
meet
them
these
twenty
thousand
are
coming
perhaps
to
conquer
the
king
let
him
conquer
them
and
turn
them
into
his
own
for
they
are
the
people
the
king
nodded
approval
but
do
you
not
know
what
will
be
said
she
cried
that
the
king
applauds
what
was
done
the
slaying
of
his
faithful
switzers
the
massacre
of
his
officers
the
putting
his
handsome
city
to
fire
and
blood
you
will
make
him
dethrone
himself
and
thank
these
gentlemen
a
disdainful
smile
passed
over
her
lips
no
madam
there
is
your
mistake
this
conduct
would
mean
there
was
some
justice
in
the
people
grievances
come
to
pardon
where
they
overstepped
the
dealing
of
wild
justice
i
am
the
king
and
the
chief
the
head
of
the
french
revolution
as
henry
fourth
was
head
of
the
league
and
the
nation
your
generals
are
my
officers
your
national
guards
my
soldiers
your
magistrates
my
own
instead
of
urging
me
on
follow
me
if
you
can
the
length
of
my
stride
will
prove
that
i
lead
in
the
footsteps
of
charlemagne
he
is
right
the
king
said
ruefully
oh
sire
for
mercy
sake
do
not
listen
to
this
man
your
enemy
her
majesty
tells
you
what
she
thinks
of
my
suggestion
said
gilbert
i
think
sir
that
you
are
the
only
person
who
has
ever
ventured
to
tell
me
the
truth
commented
louis
xvi
the
truth
is
that
what
you
have
told
exclaimed
the
queen
heaven
have
mercy
yes
madam
said
gilbert
and
believe
me
that
it
is
the
lamp
by
which
the
throne
and
royalty
will
be
prevented
rolling
into
the
abyss
he
bowed
very
humbly
as
he
spoke
to
the
queen
who
appeared
profoundly
touched
this
time
by
his
humility
or
the
reasoning
the
king
rose
with
a
decisive
air
as
though
determined
on
realization
but
from
his
habit
of
doing
nothing
without
consulting
with
his
consort
he
asked
do
you
approve
it
must
be
was
her
rejoinder
i
am
not
asking
for
your
abnegation
but
support
to
my
belief
in
that
case
i
am
convinced
that
the
realm
will
become
the
meanest
and
most
deplorable
of
all
in
christendom
you
exaggerate
deplorable
i
grant
but
mean
your
ancestors
left
you
a
dreary
inheritance
said
marie
antoinette
sorrowfully
which
i
grieve
you
should
share
added
louis
allow
me
to
say
sire
that
the
future
may
not
be
so
lamentable
interposed
gilbert
who
pitied
the
dethroned
rulers
a
despotic
monarchy
has
ceased
but
a
constitutional
one
commences
am
i
the
man
to
found
that
in
france
asked
the
king
why
not
exclaimed
the
queen
catching
some
hope
from
suggestion
madam
i
see
clearly
from
the
day
when
i
walk
among
men
like
themselves
i
lose
all
the
factitious
strength
necessary
to
govern
france
as
the
louis
before
me
did
the
french
want
a
master
and
one
who
will
wield
the
sword
i
feel
no
power
to
strike
not
to
strike
those
who
would
rob
your
children
of
their
estate
cried
the
queen
and
who
wish
to
break
the
lilies
on
your
crown
what
am
i
to
answer
if
i
answer
no
i
raise
in
you
one
of
those
storms
which
embitter
my
life
you
know
how
to
hate
so
much
the
better
for
you
you
can
be
unjust
i
do
not
reproach
you
for
it
is
an
excellent
trait
in
the
lordly
madam
we
must
resign
ourselves
it
takes
strength
to
push
ahead
this
car
with
wheels
and
we
lack
strength
that
is
bad
for
it
will
run
over
our
children
sighed
marie
antoinette
i
know
it
but
we
shall
not
be
pushing
it
we
can
draw
it
back
sire
oh
beware
said
gilbert
deeply
it
will
crush
you
then
let
him
speak
what
the
newspapers
have
been
saying
for
a
week
past
at
any
rate
he
wraps
up
the
bitterness
of
his
free
speech
said
the
king
in
short
i
shall
go
to
paris
who
knows
but
you
will
find
it
the
gulf
i
fear
said
the
queen
in
a
hollow
irritated
voice
the
assassin
may
be
there
with
his
bullet
who
will
know
among
a
thousand
threatening
fists
which
holds
the
dagger
fear
nothing
of
that
sort
they
love
me
said
louis
you
make
me
pity
you
for
saying
that
they
love
you
who
slay
and
mangle
and
cut
the
throats
of
your
representatives
the
governor
of
the
bastile
was
your
image
they
killed
that
brave
and
faithful
servitor
as
they
would
kill
you
in
his
stead
the
more
easy
as
they
know
you
and
that
you
would
turn
the
other
cheek
to
the
smiter
if
you
are
killed
what
about
my
children
concluded
the
queen
madam
struck
in
gilbert
deeming
it
time
he
intervened
the
king
is
so
respected
that
i
fear
that
his
entry
will
be
like
that
of
juggernaut
under
whose
wheels
the
fanatics
will
throw
themselves
to
be
crushed
this
march
into
paris
will
be
a
triumphal
progress
i
am
rather
of
the
doctor
opinion
said
the
monarch
say
you
are
eager
to
enjoy
this
triumph
said
the
queen
the
king
is
right
and
his
eagerness
proves
the
accuracy
of
his
judgment
on
men
and
events
the
sooner
his
majesty
is
the
greater
will
be
his
triumph
by
delay
the
gain
may
be
lost
this
promptness
will
change
the
king
position
and
make
the
act
in
some
way
his
order
lose
time
sire
and
their
demand
will
be
an
order
not
master
gilbert
said
the
queen
grant
me
till
then
and
i
swear
not
to
oppose
the
movement
but
who
knows
what
will
happen
meanwhile
expostulated
the
king
in
despair
marie
you
seem
doomed
to
ruin
me
the
assembly
will
send
me
some
addresses
which
will
rob
me
of
all
the
merit
in
taking
the
first
step
gilbert
nodded
better
so
said
the
queen
with
sullen
fury
refuse
and
preserve
your
regal
dignity
go
not
to
paris
but
wage
war
from
here
and
if
we
must
die
here
let
us
fall
like
rulers
like
masters
like
christians
who
cling
to
their
god
as
to
their
crown
the
king
saw
from
her
excitement
that
he
must
give
way
but
what
do
you
expect
between
whiles
he
inquired
a
reinforcement
from
germany
or
news
from
town
it
was
a
coat
of
mail
which
the
king
refused
to
wear
but
her
misapprehension
of
the
monarch
who
knew
he
was
not
of
the
times
when
kings
wore
armor
cost
a
precious
time
without
other
safeguard
than
gilbert
breast
as
the
latter
rode
in
the
coach
beside
the
monarch
the
visit
to
paris
was
made
in
the
queen
drive
in
the
champs
elysées
mayor
bailly
offered
him
the
city
keys
saying
sire
i
bring
your
majesty
the
keys
of
the
good
city
they
are
the
same
offered
to
henry
fourth
he
won
his
people
but
the
people
have
now
won
their
king
on
the
return
all
having
passed
smoothly
crossing
louis
xv
place
a
shot
was
fired
from
across
the
river
and
gilbert
felt
a
stroke
the
bullet
had
hit
one
of
his
steel
vest
buttons
and
glanced
off
into
the
crowd
and
killed
an
unfortunate
woman
the
king
heard
her
scream
and
heard
the
shot
burning
powder
in
my
honor
he
said
yes
sire
was
gilbert
easy
reply
it
was
never
known
what
hand
fired
this
regicidal
shot
which
justified
the
queen
fear
that
her
husband
would
be
assassinated
while
all
was
festivity
at
paris
gloom
settled
down
on
versailles
at
eventide
with
darkness
came
its
retinue
of
fears
and
sinister
visions
when
suddenly
uproar
was
heard
at
the
end
of
the
town
the
queen
shuddered
and
ran
to
a
window
which
she
opened
with
her
own
hand
a
hussar
came
up
to
the
palace
it
was
a
lieutenant
sent
by
charny
who
had
gone
on
towards
paris
to
get
the
news
he
reported
that
the
king
was
safe
and
sound
and
that
he
would
arrive
shortly
taking
her
two
children
by
the
hand
marie
antoinette
went
down
and
out
upon
the
grand
staircase
where
were
grouped
the
servants
and
the
courtiers
her
piercing
eye
perceived
a
woman
in
white
leaning
on
the
stone
balustrade
and
eagerly
looking
into
the
shadows
it
was
countess
andrea
enrapt
in
expectation
of
her
husband
so
that
she
did
not
see
her
royal
mistress
or
disdained
to
notice
her
whether
she
bore
the
queen
rancor
or
merely
yearned
to
see
her
husband
it
was
a
double
stab
for
the
beloved
of
charny
but
she
had
determined
on
the
righteous
course
she
trod
her
jealousy
underfoot
she
immolated
her
secret
joys
and
wrath
to
the
sanctity
of
the
conjugal
oath
no
doubt
from
heaven
was
sent
this
salutary
love
to
raise
her
husband
and
children
above
all
else
her
pride
too
lifted
her
above
earthly
desires
and
she
could
be
selfish
without
deserving
blame
as
the
coach
came
up
she
descended
the
steps
and
when
its
door
was
opened
and
louis
stepped
out
she
did
not
notice
how
the
grooms
and
footmen
hastened
to
tear
off
the
rosettes
and
streamers
of
the
new
popular
colors
with
which
billet
and
pitou
and
others
of
the
throng
had
decorated
the
vehicle
and
horses
with
an
outcry
of
love
and
delight
the
queen
embraced
the
king
she
sobbed
as
though
she
had
fully
expected
never
again
to
see
him
in
her
impulse
of
an
overburdened
heart
she
did
not
remark
the
the
charnys
exchanged
in
the
darkness
as
the
royal
children
kissed
their
father
the
elder
boy
spied
the
cockade
reddened
by
the
torchlight
on
his
father
hat
and
exclaimed
with
his
childish
astonishment
oh
papa
what
is
on
your
white
cockade
blood
it
was
the
national
red
spying
it
herself
the
queen
plucked
it
off
with
profound
disgust
as
the
king
stooped
as
if
to
kiss
his
daughter
but
really
to
hide
his
shame
the
mad
woman
did
not
think
that
she
was
insulting
the
nation
which
would
repay
her
at
an
early
day
throw
the
thing
away
she
cried
casting
it
down
the
steps
so
that
all
the
escort
tramped
over
it
this
strange
transition
extinguished
her
phase
of
marital
love
she
looked
round
for
charny
without
appearing
to
do
so
he
had
fallen
back
into
the
ranks
like
a
soldier
i
thank
you
my
lord
she
said
to
him
at
last
you
have
kept
your
promise
to
restore
the
king
to
me
unhurt
who
is
that
inquired
the
sovereign
oh
charny
but
where
is
gilbert
whom
i
do
not
see
come
to
supper
said
the
queen
to
change
the
subject
go
to
the
countess
my
lord
charny
and
bring
her
we
shall
have
a
family
supper
party
she
was
the
queen
again
but
still
she
was
vexed
that
the
count
who
had
been
sad
should
cheer
up
at
the
prospect
of
his
wife
being
in
the
company
chapter
xxiii
why
the
queen
waited
a
little
calm
succeeded
at
versailles
the
political
and
mental
tempests
which
we
have
chronicled
the
king
breathed
again
and
consoled
himself
with
his
regaled
popularity
for
what
his
bourbon
pride
had
suffered
in
truckling
to
the
paris
mob
the
nobility
prepared
to
flee
or
to
resist
the
people
watched
and
waited
assured
that
she
was
the
butt
of
all
the
slings
and
arrows
of
hatred
the
queen
made
herself
as
inconspicuous
as
possible
she
knew
that
for
her
party
she
was
the
centre
of
all
hopes
since
the
king
went
to
paris
she
had
not
seen
gilbert
but
the
chance
was
offered
her
when
they
met
in
the
vestibule
of
the
royal
apartments
going
to
the
king
she
challenged
as
he
bowed
deeply
as
physician
or
counsellor
she
continued
with
a
smile
betraying
some
irony
as
doctor
it
is
my
day
on
duty
he
replied
she
beckoned
him
to
follow
her
into
a
little
sideroom
you
see
sir
she
began
that
you
were
wrong
the
other
day
when
you
assured
me
that
the
king
ran
no
risk
of
murder
a
woman
was
killed
by
a
shot
aimed
at
him
and
striking
you
without
injury
who
told
me
so
gentlemen
of
the
escort
who
saw
your
button
fly
i
do
not
believe
it
was
a
crime
or
if
so
one
to
be
imputed
to
the
people
returned
gilbert
hesitatingly
who
are
we
to
attribute
it
to
then
she
demanded
fixing
her
eyes
upon
him
i
have
been
studying
the
masses
some
time
he
responded
when
in
fury
the
mobs
tear
and
slay
like
a
tiger
but
in
cold
blood
they
seek
no
they
want
to
make
the
blood
fly
with
their
own
claws
and
fangs
as
witness
foulon
and
his
berthier
savigny
accused
of
complicity
in
the
great
grain
fraud
and
ripped
to
pieces
by
the
crowd
and
flesselles
slain
by
a
pistol
but
the
accounts
of
their
atrocious
executions
may
be
untrue
we
crowned
heads
are
so
engirt
by
flatterers
madam
you
do
not
believe
any
more
than
i
that
flesselles
was
killed
by
the
mob
others
of
higher
degree
were
more
interested
in
his
death
as
for
the
king
those
who
love
their
country
believe
he
is
useful
to
it
and
these
stand
between
him
and
the
assassin
eagerly
alas
said
she
there
was
a
time
when
a
good
frenchman
would
have
expressed
his
sentiments
in
better
terms
than
those
it
was
not
possible
then
to
love
his
country
without
loving
his
rulers
gilbert
blushed
and
bowed
feeling
the
thrill
at
his
heart
which
the
queen
could
impart
in
her
periods
of
winning
intimacy
madam
i
beg
to
boast
that
i
love
the
monarchy
better
than
many
are
we
not
at
an
era
when
it
is
not
enough
to
say
so
but
actions
should
speak
madam
i
was
your
enemy
yesterday
when
you
had
me
imprisoned
and
now
i
am
your
servant
but
whence
the
change
it
is
not
in
your
nature
doctor
to
change
your
feelings
opinion
and
belief
so
readily
you
are
a
man
with
a
memory
you
know
how
to
lengthen
out
your
vengeance
tell
me
the
aim
of
your
change
madam
you
reproach
me
with
loving
my
country
too
dearly
you
love
it
so
as
to
stoop
to
serve
me
the
foreigner
no
i
am
a
frenchwoman
i
love
my
country
you
smile
but
it
is
my
country
i
have
adopted
it
german
by
birth
i
am
french
through
the
heart
but
i
love
france
through
the
king
and
the
respect
due
the
god
which
consecrated
me
to
it
but
i
understand
you
it
is
not
the
same
thing
you
love
france
purely
and
simply
for
france
sake
madam
i
can
not
be
outspoken
without
disrespect
replied
the
doctor
oh
she
said
dreadful
is
this
epoch
when
men
pretending
to
be
honorable
isolate
two
principles
that
should
never
be
parted
and
have
always
marched
forward
together
france
and
her
king
is
there
not
a
tragedy
in
which
a
queen
abandoned
by
all
is
asked
what
remains
and
she
answers
well
like
medea
i
am
here
and
we
shall
see
the
outcome
she
passed
out
in
vexation
leaving
gilbert
in
stupor
by
her
fiery
breath
she
had
blown
aside
a
corner
of
the
veil
beyond
which
simmered
the
of
the
let
us
look
to
ourselves
thought
gilbert
the
queen
is
nursing
a
scheme
plainly
nothing
can
be
done
with
this
man
muttered
the
sovereign
regaining
her
rooms
he
is
a
strong
one
but
he
lacks
devotion
poor
princess
to
whom
servility
is
thought
to
be
devotion
marie
antoinette
felt
the
weight
upon
her
most
when
alone
as
woman
and
queen
she
had
nothing
to
lean
upon
or
help
her
support
the
crushing
burden
doubt
or
wavering
was
on
either
hand
uneasy
about
their
fortune
the
sycophants
fled
her
relatives
and
friends
brooded
on
exile
the
proudest
of
all
andrea
gradually
drew
aside
from
her
body
and
soul
the
noblest
and
dearest
man
of
all
charny
was
wounded
by
her
fickleness
and
was
a
prey
to
doubt
she
who
was
instinct
and
sagacity
themselves
was
fretted
by
the
crisis
this
pure
unalloyed
heart
has
not
changed
but
it
is
changing
she
reasoned
a
dreadful
conviction
for
the
woman
who
loved
with
passion
and
insupportable
for
one
who
loved
with
pride
as
the
queen
did
charny
being
a
man
all
that
george
understood
was
that
the
queen
was
unfairly
jealous
of
his
wife
nothing
pains
a
heart
incapable
of
false
play
so
much
as
to
be
suspected
of
it
nothing
so
points
attention
on
the
person
unjustly
accused
of
inspiring
an
attachment
than
jealousy
the
suspected
one
reflects
it
looks
from
the
jealous
heart
to
the
one
believed
to
be
its
rival
indeed
how
suppose
that
a
noble
and
elevated
creature
should
be
vexed
over
a
trifle
what
has
a
lovely
woman
to
be
worried
about
what
the
powerful
lady
charny
knew
that
andrea
had
been
the
bosom
friend
of
the
queen
and
wondered
why
their
love
had
cooled
and
the
confidante
stood
away
he
had
to
look
to
her
and
the
idol
lost
so
much
of
the
as
andrea
gained
by
her
unfairness
and
anger
marie
antoinette
told
charny
that
he
must
feel
less
a
lover
for
her
he
sought
for
the
cause
and
naturally
whither
the
queen
was
frowning
he
pitied
andrea
who
had
married
him
by
royal
command
and
was
but
nominally
his
wife
marie
antoinette
burst
of
affection
in
receiving
her
husband
on
his
return
from
paris
had
opened
the
eyes
of
the
count
he
began
to
steel
himself
against
her
and
she
while
him
resumed
showering
favor
on
andrea
the
latter
submitted
without
astonishment
but
also
with
no
gratitude
long
since
she
reckoned
herself
as
belonging
to
her
royal
mistress
and
she
let
the
queen
do
what
she
liked
the
result
was
a
curious
situation
such
as
women
act
and
comprehend
best
andrea
felt
all
her
husband
underwent
and
she
pitied
him
and
showed
her
pity
from
her
love
being
of
the
angelic
kind
which
is
not
fed
on
hope
this
compassion
led
to
a
gentle
approach
she
tried
to
comfort
george
without
letting
him
see
that
she
needed
the
same
consolation
this
was
done
with
that
delicacy
called
womanly
because
the
softer
sex
best
practice
it
marie
antoinette
trying
to
reign
by
dividing
saw
she
was
on
the
wrong
road
and
was
forcing
together
the
souls
which
she
wanted
to
keep
aloof
hence
in
the
silence
of
night
and
the
lonesomeness
she
felt
such
wrestlings
with
giant
despair
as
must
give
the
spirit
a
high
idea
of
its
power
since
it
can
struggle
with
so
vast
a
might
she
would
have
succumbed
had
it
not
been
for
the
diversion
of
politics
in
her
pride
she
ascribed
her
decay
to
the
depreciation
she
had
let
herself
as
a
woman
suffer
lately
in
her
active
mind
to
think
was
to
act
she
set
to
work
without
losing
a
moment
but
unfortunately
the
work
was
for
her
perdition
seeing
that
the
parisians
had
turned
into
soldiers
and
appeared
to
intend
war
she
resolved
to
show
them
what
war
really
is
for
two
months
the
king
had
been
striving
to
retain
some
shred
of
royalty
with
the
peerage
and
mirabeau
he
had
tried
to
neutralize
the
democratic
spirit
effacing
it
in
france
in
this
strife
the
monarch
had
lost
all
his
power
and
part
of
his
popularity
the
queen
had
gained
the
nickname
of
lady
veto
she
had
been
known
as
the
austrian
then
as
lady
deficit
on
account
of
the
hole
in
the
treasury
attributed
to
her
generosity
to
her
favorites
now
lady
veto
she
was
to
bear
lastly
the
title
of
the
widow
capet
after
the
conflict
in
which
the
queen
had
endeavored
to
engage
her
friends
by
showing
them
that
they
were
endangered
with
her
she
remarked
that
only
sixty
thousand
passports
had
been
applied
for
by
the
higher
classes
fleeing
to
foreign
parts
this
had
struck
the
queen
she
purposed
her
own
escape
so
as
to
leave
the
true
royalists
in
france
to
wage
a
civil
war
her
plan
was
not
bad
and
it
must
have
succeeded
had
it
not
been
for
the
evil
genius
who
was
plotting
behind
the
queen
strange
destiny
this
woman
who
inspired
great
devotion
nowhere
could
attach
discretion
it
was
known
all
over
town
that
she
intended
to
take
to
wing
before
she
had
settled
herself
and
from
that
time
it
was
impracticable
meanwhile
the
flanders
regiment
famous
for
its
royalist
fervor
arrived
at
versailles
asked
for
by
the
town
council
as
the
guarding
of
the
palace
exceeded
their
powers
at
command
it
made
a
solemn
entrance
into
the
and
received
an
ovation
from
the
courtiers
other
soldiers
and
a
band
of
young
nobles
who
had
set
up
a
company
of
their
own
with
a
special
uniform
to
which
were
joined
the
knights
of
louis
officers
on
the
retired
list
and
adventurers
only
one
black
spot
marred
the
sky
liege
had
revolted
against
the
austrian
emperor
and
this
made
it
difficult
for
him
to
succor
the
daughter
whom
he
had
wedded
to
his
brother
on
the
french
throne
after
the
flanders
regiment
had
been
welcomed
the
lifeguards
officers
voted
to
give
them
a
dinner
it
was
fixed
for
the
first
of
october
as
the
king
had
no
politics
to
trouble
him
since
the
new
government
took
all
business
on
themselves
he
passed
the
days
in
hunting
the
queen
was
applied
to
for
the
dinner
to
take
place
in
the
palace
she
let
the
guards
officers
have
the
theatre
which
was
boarded
over
to
make
more
room
and
a
hall
adjoining
she
shut
herself
up
alone
save
for
her
children
and
andrea
sad
and
thoughtful
where
the
toasts
and
the
clink
of
glasses
should
not
disturb
her
at
the
palace
gates
a
crowd
peeped
in
and
sniffed
the
air
puffing
the
fumes
of
roasts
and
wines
from
the
large
dinner
table
it
was
imprudent
to
let
the
hungry
inhale
the
vapor
of
good
cheer
and
the
morose
hear
songs
and
cheers
of
hope
and
joy
the
feast
went
on
without
any
interruption
however
at
the
second
course
the
colonel
of
the
flanders
regiment
proposed
the
regular
toasts
of
the
royal
family
which
were
hailed
so
loudly
that
the
queen
may
have
heard
the
echoes
in
her
refuge
an
officer
stood
up
he
was
a
man
of
wit
and
courage
who
foresaw
the
issue
of
this
banquet
and
was
sincerely
attached
to
the
royal
family
or
else
he
was
a
plotter
who
tried
to
challenge
the
opinion
he
proposed
the
health
of
the
nation
it
was
hooted
down
and
the
feast
took
its
plain
meaning
the
torrent
resumed
its
rush
to
forget
the
country
might
pass
but
to
insult
it
was
too
much
it
would
take
revenge
from
that
moment
discipline
was
at
an
end
the
privates
hobnobbed
with
their
superiors
and
it
was
really
a
brotherly
meeting
what
a
pity
that
the
unfortunate
king
and
sorrowful
queen
could
not
witness
such
a
gathering
officious
servants
ran
with
exaggerated
accounts
of
the
festivities
to
marie
antoinette
and
urged
that
she
should
go
with
the
young
heir
to
the
throne
by
her
side
in
the
monarch
absence
madam
i
entreat
you
to
keep
away
pleaded
count
charny
i
have
come
away
from
the
scene
they
are
too
excited
to
make
it
seemly
for
your
majesty
she
was
in
one
of
her
sulky
whimsical
moods
and
it
suited
her
to
tease
charny
by
going
counter
to
his
advice
she
looked
at
him
with
disdain
and
was
going
to
answer
him
tartly
when
he
respectfully
said
at
least
see
what
the
king
says
about
it
the
king
had
just
returned
from
hunting
marie
antoinette
ran
to
meet
him
and
dragging
him
with
her
in
his
riding
boots
and
dusty
as
he
was
she
led
him
away
without
a
glance
at
charny
and
crying
come
my
lord
to
see
a
sight
worthy
of
a
king
of
france
regard
with
her
left
hand
she
led
her
son
the
courtiers
flowed
before
and
after
the
trio
she
reached
the
theatre
doors
just
as
the
glasses
were
being
emptied
for
the
twentieth
time
to
shouts
of
god
save
the
king
long
live
the
queen
the
applause
burst
like
a
mine
exploding
when
the
king
and
queen
and
prince
royal
were
seen
on
the
floor
the
drunken
soldiers
and
heated
officers
waved
their
hats
on
their
swords
and
shouted
the
band
began
to
play
from
the
opera
of
richard
blondel
song
of
oh
richard
oh
my
king
which
so
transparently
alluded
to
the
king
in
a
kind
of
bondage
that
all
voices
took
up
the
song
the
enthusiastic
queen
did
not
see
that
the
soldiers
were
intoxicated
the
surprised
king
had
too
much
good
sense
not
to
see
more
clearly
but
he
was
weak
and
flattered
by
this
reception
so
that
he
let
the
general
frenzy
overcome
him
charny
who
had
drunk
nothing
but
water
during
the
part
of
the
banquet
which
he
attended
stood
pale
at
this
participation
of
the
royal
family
in
what
would
now
be
a
historical
event
by
their
presence
but
his
apprehension
was
still
greater
when
he
saw
his
brother
valence
the
hussar
lieutenant
approach
the
queen
and
speak
to
her
when
encouraged
by
a
smile
it
was
consent
for
she
unpinned
from
her
cap
the
cockade
she
was
wearing
and
presented
it
to
her
imprudent
knight
it
was
not
even
a
royal
rosette
but
that
of
austria
the
black
insignia
of
the
foreign
foe
this
was
not
rashness
but
treason
to
the
country
so
mad
was
the
concourse
that
they
to
whom
valence
charny
presented
the
black
cockade
tore
off
their
white
ones
and
they
who
were
wearing
the
tricolors
trampled
them
under
foot
the
exultation
became
so
high
that
the
august
guests
had
pains
to
return
to
their
rooms
without
trampling
on
those
who
prostrated
themselves
in
their
passageway
all
this
might
have
been
overlooked
as
the
freak
of
an
orgie
but
after
the
royal
family
departed
the
guests
turned
the
banquet
hall
into
a
town
taken
by
assault
the
soldiers
whooped
and
as
the
bugles
blew
the
charge
against
what
enemy
the
absent
nation
they
climbed
the
balconies
where
the
ladies
held
over
helping
hands
the
first
soldier
to
reach
the
boxes
was
a
grenadier
whom
a
nobleman
decorated
with
the
ribbon
he
was
wearing
in
his
buttonhole
the
order
of
limburg
that
is
of
no
value
but
all
the
sham
battle
was
fought
under
the
austrian
colors
while
the
national
one
was
shouted
down
only
a
few
dull
protests
were
heard
drowned
under
the
trumpet
blasts
the
hurrahs
and
the
music
of
the
band
the
tumult
came
menacingly
to
the
crowd
at
the
doors
astonished
at
first
they
were
soon
indignant
as
it
was
known
that
the
tricolor
had
been
spurned
and
the
black
streamer
flaunted
in
its
stead
an
officer
of
the
national
guard
had
been
badly
beaten
in
the
scuffle
to
uphold
the
honor
of
the
latter
but
it
was
not
known
that
charny
the
queen
favorite
had
taken
all
the
blame
of
the
outrages
on
himself
the
queen
had
returned
to
her
rooms
dazed
by
the
scene
a
swarm
of
flatterers
and
adulators
assailed
her
see
the
true
spirit
of
your
troops
they
said
when
the
fury
of
the
mob
is
bragged
of
think
how
it
would
melt
away
in
the
blast
of
this
wild
ardor
of
the
military
for
monarchical
ideas
she
was
still
under
the
illusion
that
this
fire
would
spread
over
the
kingdom
from
the
palace
at
her
will
when
next
day
receiving
the
national
guard
to
whom
she
had
promised
to
distribute
their
new
flags
she
made
this
address
i
am
happy
to
make
this
presentation
the
nation
and
the
army
ought
to
love
the
king
as
we
love
them
both
i
was
delighted
with
the
rejoicing
yesterday
at
these
words
emphasized
by
her
glittering
glance
and
sweetest
voice
the
crowd
grumbled
while
the
soldiers
applauded
noisily
she
upheld
us
said
one
party
while
the
other
muttered
we
are
betrayed
am
i
not
brave
she
asked
of
charny
who
looked
on
with
sorrow
and
listened
with
terror
to
the
point
of
folly
he
replied
with
a
deeply
clouded
face
chapter
xxiv
the
army
of
women
the
queen
was
reposing
after
the
day
of
felicitation
she
had
her
janissaries
around
her
her
cohort
of
young
bravoes
and
having
reckoned
up
her
foes
she
was
wishful
for
the
onslaught
had
she
not
the
defeat
of
the
fourteenth
of
july
the
loss
of
the
bastile
to
avenge
she
treated
andrea
with
the
former
friendship
for
a
time
deadened
in
her
bosom
but
charny
she
only
looked
where
he
was
when
she
was
forced
to
give
him
an
order
but
this
was
no
spite
against
the
family
for
it
was
noticed
that
she
paid
special
attention
to
young
valence
charny
the
hussar
who
had
been
given
her
austrian
rosette
at
the
dinner
indeed
as
he
was
crossing
the
gallery
to
announce
to
the
master
of
the
buckhound
that
the
king
would
go
hunting
that
day
marie
antoinette
who
came
out
of
the
chapel
perceived
him
and
greeted
him
the
king
goes
hunting
she
repeated
what
a
mistake
when
the
weather
is
threatening
is
it
not
andrea
yes
answered
the
lady
of
honor
absently
where
will
the
chase
be
in
meudon
wood
my
lady
well
accompany
him
and
watch
over
him
at
this
moment
the
head
of
the
charnys
appeared
he
smiled
to
andrea
and
remarked
that
is
advice
which
my
brother
will
bear
in
mind
during
the
dangers
to
the
king
as
well
as
during
his
pleasures
at
the
sound
of
the
voice
for
she
had
not
seen
him
coming
marie
antoinette
started
and
rejoined
with
studied
rudeness
i
should
have
been
astonished
if
that
speech
had
come
from
any
but
your
lordship
for
it
contains
a
foreboding
andrea
saw
her
husband
blanch
but
he
bowed
without
retort
he
noticed
her
surprise
that
he
bore
it
so
patiently
for
he
quickly
said
i
am
most
unhappy
that
i
can
no
longer
speak
to
the
queen
without
offense
the
longer
was
spoken
with
a
fine
actor
due
stress
on
the
important
words
in
a
line
speech
is
only
bad
when
the
intention
is
so
snapped
the
queen
through
her
teeth
locked
with
anger
the
ear
hears
hostilely
when
the
mind
is
hostile
was
the
repartie
of
charny
more
aptly
than
politely
i
shall
wait
to
reply
till
the
count
of
charny
is
happier
in
his
attacks
went
on
the
queen
and
i
shall
wait
to
attack
till
the
queen
most
excellent
majesty
is
more
happy
in
servitors
than
lately
andrea
grasped
her
husband
hand
hastily
and
prepared
to
go
out
of
the
gallery
with
him
when
a
glance
from
her
mistress
retained
her
in
short
what
does
have
to
say
to
me
she
inquired
sent
to
paris
yesterday
by
the
king
i
found
it
in
great
turmoil
yes
the
parisians
are
going
to
pull
down
the
bastile
the
dutch
have
taken
holland
anything
fresher
my
lord
it
is
true
that
they
are
pulling
down
the
prison
but
that
affords
them
nothing
but
stones
and
they
want
for
bread
let
them
be
hungry
said
the
queen
what
are
we
to
do
in
the
matter
since
others
rule
the
roost
there
was
a
day
when
the
queen
was
the
first
to
be
compassionate
in
times
of
general
distress
said
the
count
when
she
went
up
into
the
garrets
and
the
prayers
of
those
she
helped
rose
from
the
garrets
unto
god
yes
and
i
have
been
nicely
repaid
for
this
pity
for
others
returned
the
lady
bitterly
one
of
my
worst
miseries
came
from
my
going
into
a
garret
she
alluded
of
course
to
the
incident
of
the
queen
necklace
already
described
in
this
series
because
your
majesty
was
once
deceived
is
all
humanity
to
be
measured
by
that
bushel
oh
how
our
gracious
lady
was
loved
at
that
period
she
darted
a
flaming
look
at
him
to
be
brief
she
said
what
is
happening
in
the
capital
only
tell
me
what
you
have
actually
seen
for
i
want
to
depend
on
the
accuracy
of
your
words
i
saw
people
packed
on
the
waterside
waiting
for
the
flour
boats
others
crowding
the
bakers
doors
waiting
for
bread
a
famishing
people
husbands
watching
their
wives
sadly
mothers
mourning
over
their
babes
their
fists
were
clenched
and
shaken
in
the
direction
of
versailles
alas
i
fear
that
the
dangers
which
my
brothers
and
i
are
ready
to
brave
and
under
which
we
may
die
will
not
long
be
forthcoming
the
queen
had
leaned
on
a
window
sill
and
with
a
view
of
expressing
unconcern
she
looked
out
instead
of
towards
the
count
they
saw
her
start
and
she
exclaimed
andrea
who
is
this
rider
he
seems
by
his
speed
to
bear
news
in
hot
haste
andrea
went
up
but
almost
instantly
retreated
turning
pale
and
gasped
in
reproach
to
call
me
to
see
him
charny
had
looked
also
and
he
said
it
is
dr
gilbert
so
it
is
said
marie
antoinette
in
such
a
tone
that
it
was
not
possible
to
tell
whether
she
had
or
had
not
visited
on
andrea
her
personal
spite
gilbert
arrived
with
the
sequel
to
the
ominous
scenes
which
charny
described
the
famished
women
had
started
for
versailles
they
were
escorted
by
ragamuffins
willing
to
be
shielded
by
their
petticoats
and
ripe
for
any
deeds
seven
or
eight
thousand
women
repeated
the
queen
when
gilbert
had
delivered
his
message
of
coming
woe
she
spoke
with
scorn
but
they
have
been
reinforced
to
double
that
number
on
the
way
they
are
hungry
and
come
to
ask
bread
of
the
king
just
what
i
feared
said
charny
what
is
to
be
done
prepare
the
king
to
receive
them
suggested
gilbert
why
expose
him
she
expostulated
with
that
bravery
and
personal
consciousness
of
her
traits
and
of
her
husband
weakness
which
ought
not
to
be
exhibited
before
strangers
but
were
charny
and
gilbert
strangers
one
destined
to
guard
the
king
the
other
the
queen
the
count
replied
for
both
having
resumed
all
his
command
for
he
had
sacrificed
his
pride
madam
gilbert
is
right
the
king
is
still
loved
he
will
make
a
speech
and
disarm
these
furies
but
who
will
apprise
the
king
he
is
in
meudon
woods
and
the
ways
may
be
blocked
will
your
majesty
see
in
me
not
the
courtier
but
the
man
of
war
returned
the
count
simply
a
soldier
is
made
to
be
slain
he
did
not
wait
for
an
answer
or
to
hear
the
sigh
but
rapidly
went
out
and
mounting
a
guardman
horse
sped
away
for
meudon
the
sky
was
menacing
and
rain
began
to
dot
the
dust
but
versailles
was
filling
with
people
who
had
heard
a
noise
like
approaching
thunder
the
soldiers
took
up
their
muskets
slowly
and
the
horseguards
got
into
the
saddle
with
the
hesitation
of
the
soldier
when
his
adversaries
are
beneath
his
notice
what
could
be
done
against
women
who
had
thrown
down
their
weapons
on
the
road
and
had
scarce
the
power
to
drag
themselves
into
the
town
half
way
they
had
divided
eight
loaves
found
at
sevres
pounds
of
bread
among
seven
thousand
maillard
had
accompanied
them
and
induced
the
last
who
were
armed
to
lay
aside
their
weapons
at
the
first
houses
of
the
place
he
suggested
that
they
should
sing
long
live
henry
fourth
to
show
that
they
had
no
ill
feelings
against
royalty
they
sang
in
a
feeble
whine
great
was
the
amazement
at
the
palace
where
the
harpies
and
furies
were
expected
to
see
the
tottering
singers
hunger
giving
the
giddiness
of
intoxication
pressing
their
haggard
thinned
livid
blotched
and
dusty
faces
against
the
gilded
bars
of
the
gates
and
hanging
on
by
their
bony
hands
from
the
weird
groups
came
wails
and
howls
while
the
dull
eyes
emitted
sparks
now
and
again
the
hands
let
go
the
bars
to
be
brandished
in
threat
or
held
out
imploringly
it
was
a
gloomy
sight
what
do
you
want
challenged
st
priest
minister
of
paris
bread
was
the
cry
when
you
had
but
one
master
you
were
never
hungry
he
replied
testily
you
see
how
you
stand
since
you
have
twelve
hundred
he
came
away
yelled
at
while
he
ordered
the
gates
to
be
kept
closed
but
they
had
soon
to
be
opened
to
a
deputation
from
parliament
which
maillard
had
obtained
unfortunately
valence
charny
with
the
guards
had
ridden
against
the
mob
two
women
of
the
twelve
with
the
deputation
were
wounded
to
whom
charny
who
had
returned
to
announce
the
arrival
of
the
king
and
gilbert
rushed
to
assist
open
the
doors
called
out
the
king
a
palace
is
a
sanctuary
it
must
receive
all
callers
an
asylum
for
all
but
the
kings
and
queens
muttered
marie
antoinette
deputy
mounier
spoke
for
the
deputation
while
a
flowergirl
who
had
started
this
woman
war
by
beating
the
fall
in
on
a
drum
undertook
to
address
the
king
unfortunately
she
was
so
weak
that
she
fainted
after
gasping
bread
my
lord
help
cried
the
king
andrea
ran
up
with
her
smelling
bottle
and
charny
gave
the
queen
a
reproachful
glance
for
not
having
thought
of
this
act
turning
pale
she
retired
to
her
own
rooms
get
the
coaches
ready
she
said
the
king
and
i
are
going
to
rambouillet
meanwhile
the
flowergirl
finding
herself
in
the
king
arms
on
coming
to
her
senses
screamed
with
bashfulness
and
tried
to
kiss
his
hand
i
will
give
you
a
kiss
my
pretty
one
he
said
you
are
well
worth
it
oh
how
good
you
are
so
you
will
give
the
order
that
the
grain
shall
come
into
paris
to
stop
the
famine
i
will
sign
the
order
my
child
the
king
said
though
i
am
afraid
it
will
do
no
good
sitting
at
a
table
he
was
about
to
write
when
a
discharge
of
fire
arms
followed
a
solitary
shot
a
second
charge
of
cavalry
had
been
made
on
the
women
and
a
man
of
their
supporters
had
fired
a
gun
to
break
the
arm
of
lieutenant
savonnieres
of
the
guards
he
was
going
to
strike
a
young
soldier
who
was
defending
with
naked
hands
a
woman
who
had
dropped
behind
him
for
protection
the
bullets
from
the
lifeguards
carbines
had
killed
one
woman
the
mob
replied
and
two
soldiers
were
knocked
off
their
horses
at
the
same
time
shouts
of
make
room
for
the
guns
were
heard
as
the
men
of
antoine
ward
dragged
up
three
which
they
levelled
at
the
palace
gates
luckily
the
rain
had
damped
the
priming
powder
and
the
match
suddenly
a
whisper
came
to
gilbert
without
his
knowing
who
spoke
general
lafayette
is
half
an
hour
march
away
and
coming
it
was
a
valuable
hint
gilbert
ran
and
caught
one
of
the
horses
of
the
dismounted
guards
and
as
he
dashed
off
the
other
followed
his
hearing
the
hoofs
gilbert
thought
he
was
pursued
and
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
he
saw
the
animal
caught
by
the
reins
and
his
throat
cut
then
the
people
fell
on
the
carcase
with
knives
and
cut
it
up
while
gilbert
was
racing
to
meet
lafayette
who
arrived
with
the
national
guards
the
king
was
signing
the
acceptation
of
the
resolution
of
the
rights
of
man
for
mounier
and
the
older
to
let
grain
pass
into

for
louison
champry
the
flowergirl
as
the
first
drum
beats
were
heard
of
the
national
guards
entering
versailles
the
king
felt
his
arm
respectfully
touched
it
was
by
andrea
sire
the
queen

the
frontier

the
king
shook
his
head
he
stayed
not
from
having
courage
but
because
he
had
not
strength
to
go
a
runaway
king
he
muttered
tell
the
queen
to
depart
alone
he
said
to
andrea
who
went
on
her
errand
five
minutes
afterwards
the
queen
came
and
stood
by
her
husband
side
i
have
come
to
die
with
you
she
said
unaffectedly
how
handsome
she
is
now
muttered
charny
but
she
heard
him
for
she
started
i
believe
in
all
truth
that
it
is
better
to
die
than
live
sire
said
gilbert
running
in
fear
nothing
now
general
lafayette
is
here
the
king
did
not
like
lafayette
but
there
his
feelings
stopped
while
the
queen
hated
him
and
let
her
hate
be
seen
she
took
three
steps
back
but
the
king
stayed
her
with
an
imperative
gesture
the
courtiers
formed
two
groups
charny
and
gilbert
stood
next
the
king
steps
were
heard
up
to
the
door
of
many
persons
but
all
alone
general
lafayette
entered
as
he
did
so
some
voice
exclaimed
here

the
marquis
smiling

not
have
walked
unguarded
into
the

to

he
added
to
gilbert
we

thought
the
queen
it
will
be
too
late
as
she
was
going
to
her
own
rooms
she
was
lighted
by
a
red
glare
outside
the
palace
the
mob
had
made
a
barbecue
of
the
soldiers
horses
chapter
xxv
the
night
of
horrors
the
night
went
by
quietly
at
midnight
the
queen
had
tried
to
go
out
to
the
trianon
palace
but
the
national
guards
had
refused
to
let
her
pass
when
she
spoke
of
feeling
fear
they
answered
that
she
was
safer
here
than
any
other
place
she
felt
encouraged
indeed
on
her
return
home
by
having
her
most
faithful
guards
around
her
at
the
door
was
valence
charny
leaning
on
the
carbine
used
by
the
lifeguards
as
well
as
the
dragoons
in
those
days
it
was
not
the
habit
of
the
indoor
guards
to
carry
swords
on
duty
oh
it
is
you
viscount
always
faithful
she
said
am
i
not
at
my
post
where
my
brother
set
me
while
he
is
by
the
king
he
is
the
head
of
our
family
and
his
place
is
to
die
before
the
head
of
the
kingdom
yes
said
the
royal
lady
with
marked
bitterness
you
only
have
the
right
to
die
for
the
queen
it
will
be
a
great
honor
for
me
if
god
permits
me
to
accomplish
that
duty
said
the
young
man
bowing
what
has
become
of
the
countess
she
asked
returning
after
making
a
step
to
go
for
a
suspicion
had
stung
her
in
the
heart
she
came
past
ten
minutes
ago
and
is
having
her
bed
made
in
your
majesty
the
queen
bit
her
lip
it
was
impossible
to
surprise
the
charnys
in
default
in
matters
of
duty
thank
you
sir
she
said
with
a
winning
nod
and
wave
of
the
hand
for
so
well
guarding
the
queen
thank
your
brother
from
me
for
so
well
guarding
the
king
in
the
andrea
was
respectfully
awaiting
her
i
thank
you
as
i
have
thanked
the
viscount
and
your
husband
through
him
andrea
made
a
courtesy
and
moved
aside
for
her
to
go
by
the
queen
did
not
ask
her
to
follow
for
this
cold
devotion
which
lasted
unto
death
put
her
ill
at
ease
gilbert
had
gone
away
with
general
lafayette
who
had
been
twelve
hours
on
horseback
and
was
ready
to
drop
at
the
gates
they
saw
billet
who
had
come
with
the
national
guards
ready
to
follow
gilbert
like
a
dog
to
the
end
of
the
world
all
was
quiet
we
repeat
up
to
three
in
the
morning
then
arrived
a
second
army
from
town
the
other
was
composed
of
women
and
came
for
bread
this
one
came
for
vengeance
and
was
composed
of
friends
the
leaders
were
marat
a
hideous
hunchbacked
dwarf
named
verriere
who
came
to
the
surface
from
the
mud
when
society
was
stirred
and
the
duke
of
aiguillon
disguised
as
a
fishfog
they
came
like
after
a
battle
to
fire
and
pillage
there
had
been
plenty
of
killing
to
do
at
the
bastile
but
no
plunder
and
they
reckoned
to
make
up
for
that
at
versailles
at
five
in
the
morning
five
or
six
hundred
of
this
forced
or
scaled
the
great
gate
a
sentinel
had
fired
an
alarm
shot
which
slew
one
of
the
assailants
divided
as
by
a
giant
swordstroke
the
plunderers
broke
into
two
gangs
one
aiming
at
the
royal
plate
the
other
at
the
crown
jewels
one
stormed
the
queen
apartments
the
other
made
for
the
chapel
where
the
king
were
the
sea
rose
like
a
high
tide
the
guards
of
the
king
at
that
hour
were
the
regular
sentry
watching
at
the
door
and
an
officer
who
rushed
out
of
the
with
a
halberd
snatched
from
the
hands
of
the
frightened
swiss
porter
who
goes
there
challenged
the
sentinel
three
times
while
leveling
his
carbine
the
officer
knew
what
excitement
would
result
from
firearms
being
shot
off
there
in
the
private
apartments
so
he
beat
up
the
gun
with
his
halberd
and
barred
the
stairs
with
it
clear
across
as
he
faced
the
intruders
what
do
you
want
he
challenged
them
oh
dear
nothing
of
course
jeered
several
voices
we
are
old
friends
of
her
majesty
so
let
us
pass
you
are
pretty
friends
to
bring
war
here
there
was
no
reply
but
an
ominous
laugh
a
man
seized
the
spear
and
tried
to
wrest
it
from
the
officer
and
as
he
would
not
let
go
he
bit
his
hand
the
officer
tore
the
weapon
away
shortened
it
so
as
to
use
it
as
an
ax
and
split
the
cannibal
skull
with
one
chop
but
the
violence
of
the
blow
broke
the
staff
in
two
made
for
ornament
rather
than
use
as
it
was
the
officer
remained
armed
with
two
weapons
in
one
the
ax
and
the
spear
while
he
used
both
effectively
the
sentinel
opened
the
door
and
called
for
help
guardsmen
ran
out
to
the
rescue
of
lord
charny
gentlemen
shouted
the
sentry
swords
flashed
in
the
light
of
a
lamp
in
the
lobby
and
the
assailants
were
given
some
work
to
do
on
either
side
of
charny
cries
of
pain
were
heard
and
the
blood
spirted
while
the
ruffians
rolled
down
the
marble
steps
which
they
streaked
with
gore
the
door
opened
and
the
sentry
called
out
by
order
of
the
king
gentlemen
return
the
guards
profited
by
the
momentary
confusion
of
these
foes
to
execute
the
retreat
with
charny
the
last
to
enter
the
haven
the
door
was
hardly
closed
behind
him
and
the
two
large
bolts
shot
into
the
sockets
before
a
hundred
blows
sounded
on
it
but
they
piled
up
the
furniture
against
it
so
that
it
would
hold
out
for
ten
minutes
during
that
time
reinforcements
might
arrive
meanwhile
the
second
gang
had
darted
towards
the
queen
apartments
but
the
stairs
were
narrow
and
only
two
can
go
up
abreast
it
was
in
the
corridor
that
valence
charny
watched
he
fired
when
his
challenge
was
not
replied
to
the
door
opened
and
andrea
appeared
having
heard
the
shot
save
her
majesty
cried
the
young
man
they
are
after
her
life
i
am
alone
against
fifty
but
never
mind
i
shall
hold
the
door
as
long
as
i
can
make
haste
the
assailants
stole
upon
him
and
he
banged
the
door
to
shouting
fasten
the
bolts
i
shall
live
long
enough
to
give
the
queen
time
to
flee
turning
around
he
ran
two
wretches
through
with
his
bayonet
the
queen
had
heard
all
this
and
andrea
found
her
afoot
when
she
entered
her
bedroom
two
of
her
ladies
hastily
dressed
her
and
urged
her
into
the
private
way
while
andrea
always
calm
and
indifferent
to
danger
for
herself
bolted
each
door
by
which
they
passed
at
the
junction
of
the
communication
of
the
two
royal
apartments
a
man
was
waiting
it
was
charny
covered
with
blood
the
king
cried
marie
antoinette
on
seeing
this
you
promised
to
save
him
he
is
saved
replied
the
count
looking
through
the
doorways
and
not
seeing
among
the
members
of
the
royal
family
and
others
his
wife
he
was
going
to
ask
about
her
when
a
glance
from
the
queen
stopped
him
he
had
no
need
to
speak
for
her
gaze
plunging
into
his
heart
had
read
his
wish
rest
easy
she
is
coming
she
said
she
ran
to
the
little
prince
whom
she
took
in
her
arms
closing
the
last
door
andrea
came
into
the
hall
like
the
rest
she
and
her
husband
exchanged
no
word
their
smiles
were
ample
strange
those
long
parted
hearts
began
to
yearn
for
one
another
since
danger
surrounded
them
the
king
is
looking
for
you
madam
replied
charny
to
the
inquiries
he
was
going
to
your
rooms
by
one
corridor
while
you
came
to
his
by
another
they
heard
the
assassins
yelling
down
with
the
austrians
death
to
messalina
no
more
of
lady
veto
let
us
throttle
her
let
her
hang
a
couple
of
were
heard
at
the
same
time
and
two
holes
were
bored
in
the
door
one
bullet
whizzed
close
to
the
young
prince
head
and
buried
itself
in
the
hangings
oh
heavens
we
shall
all
die
screamed
the
queen
falling
on
her
knees
at
a
sign
from
charny
the
lifeguardsmen
formed
a
shelter
for
her
and
the
royal
children
the
king
now
joined
them
pale
of
face
and
his
eyes
full
of
tears
he
was
calling
for
the
queen
as
she
had
for
him
on
seeing
her
he
ran
into
her
arms
saved
exclaimed
she
by
the
count
replied
the
monarch
indicating
charny
and
has
he
saved
you
too
it
was
his
brother
said
she
my
lord
we
owe
more
to
your
family
than
we
can
ever
repay
observed
the
sovereign
the
queen
blushed
as
she
met
andrea
glance
and
turned
her
head
aside
the
blows
on
the
door
resounded
gentlemen
we
must
hold
the
post
for
an
hour
said
the
count
it
will
take
that
time
to
kill
us
seven
if
we
hold
out
stoutly
it
is
not
likely
that
help
will
not
have
come
for
their
majesties
with
these
words
he
caught
hold
of
an
immense
sideboard
and
his
example
being
followed
a
head
of
shattered
furniture
formed
a
wall
in
which
the
guards
cut
loopholes
to
shoot
through
the
queen
prayed
over
her
children
stifled
their
wailing
and
tears
the
king
retired
into
a
closet
adjoining
to
burn
papers
which
ought
not
to
fall
into
strange
hands
the
door
was
chopped
at
till
pieces
fell
off
every
instant
and
through
the
gaps
blood
pikes
were
thrust
and
jagged
bayonets
which
tried
to
dart
death
at
the
same
time
bullets
found
holes
in
the
breastwork
and
furrowed
the
plaster
on
the
gilded
ceiling
at
length
a
bench
on
top
of
the
sideboard
fell
down
the
buffet
lost
one
panel
and
bloody
arms
were
plunged
in
through
the
orifice
to
make
the
crevice
larger
the
guards
had
burnt
the
last
cartridge
though
not
vainly
for
through
the
channel
dead
bodies
were
seen
strewing
the
lobby
at
the
shrieks
of
the
ladies
who
supposed
death
was
to
leap
in
at
the
breach
the
king
returned
sire
said
charny
shut
yourself
up
with
the
queen
in
the
most
remote
room
fasten
all
the
doors
after
you
at
each
door
let
two
of
us
stand
i
ask
to
be
the
last
and
guard
the
last
i
warrant
we
shall
keep
them
off
for
two
hours
they
take
forty
minutes
full
to
get
through
this
the
king
hesitated
it
seemed
so
shameful
to
step
from
room
to
room
closing
doors
on
brave
men
left
to
die
for
him
he
would
not
have
drawn
back
but
for
the
queen
if
she
had
not
had
her
children
with
her
she
would
have
stayed
beside
him
but
alas
king
or
subject
all
have
a
flaw
in
the
iron
heart
through
which
pierces
terror
when
boldness
elopes
the
king
was
about
to
give
the
order
to
retreat
when
the
arms
were
suddenly
retracted
the
spears
and
bayonets
disappeared
and
the
shouts
and
thwarts
were
silenced
in
the
instant
of
stillness
all
waited
with
parted
lips
listening
ears
and
held
breath
the
tramp
of
regular
troops
was
heard
the
national
guard
shouted
charny
my
lord
charny
bellowed
a
hearty
voice
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
farmer
billet
cried
charny
as
a
face
showed
itself
is
it
you
my
friend
yes
my
lord
where
is
the
king
and
the
queen
here
safe
and
sound
god
be
thanked
this
way
dr
gilbert
two
woman
hearts
thrilled
variously
at
this
name
andrea
and
the
queen
charny
turning
instinctively
saw
both
turn
pale
he
sighed
as
he
shook
his
head
open
the
doors
gentlemen
cried
the
king
here
are
friends
the
lifeguardsmen
hurried
to
tear
down
the
remains
of
the
barrier
during
their
work
the
voice
of
marquis
lafayette
was
heard
gentlemen
of
the
national
guard
i
pledged
my
word
last
night
to
the
king
that
nothing
appertaining
to
his
majesty
should
incur
harm
if
you
allow
his
lifeguards
to
be
hurt
you
break
my
word
of
honor
and
i
shall
no
longer
be
worthy
of
being
your
chief
when
the
obstacles
were
removed
the
two
first
persons
seen
were
general
lafayette
and
gilbert
a
little
to
their
left
was
billet
delighted
at
having
had
a
part
in
the
king
deliverance
it
was
he
who
had
gone
and
roused
up
the
general
for
this
deed
long
live
the
king
long
live
the
queen
roared
billet
ah
if
you
had
stayed
in
paris
this
would
not
have
happened
general
what
do
you
advise
asked
the
king
of
the
marquis
i
think
you
should
show
yourself
at
the
window
gilbert
nodded
and
louis
walked
straight
to
the
window
opened
it
and
stepped
out
on
the
balcony
long
live
the
king
was
the
universal
shout
come
to
paris
added
others
while
a
few
but
the
most
dreadful
ones
let
us
have
the
queen
out
here
all
shivered
the
king
lost
color
as
did
gilbert
and
charny
she
looked
at
lafayette
who
said
fear
nothing
all
alone
she
questioned
with
the
charming
manners
he
preserved
to
old
age
marquis
lafayette
gently
detached
the
clinging
children
from
their
mother
and
urged
them
out
upon
the
balcony
he
offered
his
hand
to
marie
antoinette
adding
if
your
majesty
will
rely
on
me
all
will
go
well
he
led
her
out
on
the
balcony
above
the
marble
courtyard
a
sea
of
enflamed
human
heads
the
yell
that
burst
forth
at
sight
of
the
queen
was
immense
but
none
could
say
whether
it
was
threat
or
joy
lafayette
bent
and
kissed
her
hand
this
time
applause
rent
the
air
for
the
meanest
there
did
homage
to
beauty
and
womanhood
strange
people
muttered
the
austrian
but
what
about
my
lifeguards
can
you
do
nothing
for
them
let
me
have
one
of
them
charny
drew
back
for
he
had
offered
himself
as
the
scapecat
for
the
officers
revelry
of
the
first
october
and
he
did
not
want
amnesty
andrea
took
his
hand
and
also
stood
back
again
those
two
had
understood
each
other
and
the
queen
flashed
her
eye
with
panting
bosom
she
gasped
in
a
broken
voice
another
a
guardsman
obeyed
who
had
not
his
captain
reasons
lafayette
led
him
out
on
the
balcony
put
his
own
tricolored
cockade
in
his
hat
and
shook
his
hand
bravo
lafayette
the
lifeguards
are
not
a
bad
sort
a
few
voices
remonstrated
but
they
were
drowned
by
the
cheers
all
is
over
and
the
fine
weather
sets
in
said
the
general
for
the
calm
not
to
be
broken
again
one
final
sacrifice
is
necessary
come
to
paris
general
you
may
announce
that
i
shall
depart
for
the
capital
in
an
hour
with
the
queen
and
the
rest
of
the
royal
family
this
order
seemed
to
remind
charny
of
something
he
had
forgotten
and
he
sprang
away
with
alacrity
the
queen
followed
him
both
guided
by
tracks
of
blood
the
queen
shut
her
eyes
and
groping
for
support
met
the
hand
of
charny
which
led
her
on
suddenly
she
felt
him
shudder
a
dead
man
she
shrieked
opening
her
eyes
will
your
majesty
excuse
me
taking
away
my
arm
i
find
what
i
sought
the
remains
of
my
brother
valence
here
lay
the
unfortunate
young
man
whom
the
head
of
the
charnys
had
ordered
to
let
himself
be
slain
for
the
queen
sake
he
had
punctiliously
obeyed
chapter

billet
sorrow
at
the
time
when
the
queen
and
her
consort
were
leaving
versailles
never
more
to
return
under
its
roof
the
following
scene
was
taking
place
in
one
of
its
inner
yards
damp
with
the
rain
which
a
bitter
fall
gale
was
beginning
to
dry
up
over
a
dead
body
a
man
clad
in
black
was
bending
a
man
in
the
royal
lifeguards
uniform
knelt
on
the
other
side
three
paces
off
stood
a
third
person
with
fixed
eyes
and
closed
hands
the
body
was
of
a
young
man
not
more
than
all
of
whose
blood
seemed
to
have
poured
out
through
ghastly
wounds
in
the
head
and
chest
his
furrowed
and
livid
white
breast
appeared
yet
to
heave
with
the
disdainful
breath
of
hopeless
defense
the
head
thrown
back
and
the
mouth
open
in
pain
and
anger
recalled
the
fine
figure
of
speech
of
the
ancient
romans
and
with
a
wail
the
spirit
fled
to
the
abode
of
shades
the
man
in
black
was
gilbert
the
lifeguards
officer
count
charny
the
bystander
billet
the
corpse
was
viscount
valence
charny
gilbert
regarded
it
with
that
fixed
gaze
which
suspends
the
fleeing
soul
in
the
dying
and
seems
in
the
dead
able
to
recall
the
fled
one
cold
and
rigid
he
is
dead
and
really
dead
he
said
at
last
charny
uttered
a
hoarse
groan
and
pressing
the
corpse
in
his
arms
emitted
so
a
sob
that
the
physician
shuddered
and
billet
went
off
a
little
to
hide
his
head
in
a
corner
of
the
quadrangle
suddenly
the
mourner
raised
the
body
set
it
against
the
wall
in
a
sitting
posture
and
slowly
came
away
but
looking
to
see
if
it
would
not
revive
and
follow
him
gilbert
remained
on
one
knee
resting
his
chin
on
his
hand
thoughtfully
appalled
and
motionless
then
billet
quitted
the
nook
and
came
to
him
saying
as
he
no
longer
heard
the
wails
of
the
count
which
had
made
his
heart
ache
alas
gilbert
this
is
really
civil
war
and
what
you
foretold
is
coming
to
pass
only
the
trouble
comes
sooner
than
i
believed
and
perhaps
sooner
then
you
calculated
i
have
seen
villains
slaughter
wicked
men
i
have
trembled
in
all
my
limbs
and
felt
a
horror
for
such
monsters
but
yet
the
men
who
were
killed
so
far
were
worthless
now
as
you
predicted
they
are
killing
honest
folk
they
have
killed
viscount
charny
i
do
not
shudder
but
i
grieve
i
do
not
feel
so
much
horror
for
the
murderers
as
fear
for
myself
the
young
gentleman
has
been
fouly
done
to
death
for
he
was
only
a
soldier
and
fought
he
ought
not
to
have
been
butchered
he
uttered
a
sigh
from
his
vitals
to
think
that
i
knew
him
when
a
child
he
continued
i
can
see
him
now
riding
along
on
his
little
grey
pony
carrying
bread
round
to
the
poor
on
behalf
of
his
mother
he
was
a
fine
pink
and
child
with
big
blue
eyes
who
was
always
laughing
well
it
is
queer
since
i
have
seen
him
laying
there
bleeding
and
disfigured
it
is
no
longer
as
a
corpse
that
i
think
of
him
but
as
the
pretty
boy
with
the
basket
on
his
left
arm
and
a
purse
in
his
right
hand
really
gilbert
i
believe
that
i
have
had
enough
of
this
kind
of
thing
and
i
do
not
care
to
see
any
more
of
it
for
as
all
you
foretold
is
true
i
shall
be
seeing
you
die
and
then
be
calm
billet
said
the
physician
shaking
his
head
gently
my
hour
has
not
struck
but
mayhap
mine
has
down
yonder
the
harvest
is
rotting
the
land
is
laying
unplowed
and
my
family
languishes
whom
i
love
and
ten
times
more
fondly
since
i
have
seen
this
corpse
for
which
his
family
will
weep
what
are
you
driving
at
billet
do
you
suppose
that
i
am
going
to
pity
your
fate
oh
no
answered
the
farmer
simply
but
as
i
must
cry
out
when
i
am
in
pain
and
as
crying
out
leads
to
nothing
i
want
to
relieve
myself
in
my
own
way
in
short
i
want
to
go
home
on
my
farm
master
gilbert
what
again
look
ye
a
voice
down
there
is
calling
me
home
that
voice
is
prompting
you
to
desertion
billet
i
am
no
soldier
to
desert
sir
what
you
want
to
do
is
worse
than
desertion
in
a
soldier
i
should
like
that
explained
doctor
you
come
to
paris
to
overthrow
an
old
house
and
you
turn
away
before
the
building
is
down
for
fear
it
will
tumble
on
my
friends
yes
doctor
rather
to
save
yourself
why
there
is
no
law
against
taking
care
of
number
one
said
billet
a
pretty
calculation
as
if
the
stones
might
not
bound
in
falling
and
rolling
and
kill
the
runaway
at
a
distance
oh
you
know
i
am
not
to
be
scared
then
you
will
remain
for
i
have
need
of
you
here
my
dear
billet
my
folks
also
have
need
of
me
at
home
billet
billet
i
thought
you
had
agreed
with
me
that
a
man
has
no
home
when
he
loves
his
country
i
should
like
to
know
if
you
would
talk
like
that
if
your
son
sebastian
lay
there
in
that
young
gentleman
stead
he
pointed
to
the
corpse
billet
a
day
will
come
when
my
son
will
see
me
laid
out
like
that
was
the
stoical
response
so
much
the
worse
for
you
doctor
if
he
is
as
cold
as
you
over
it
i
hope
he
will
bear
it
better
than
me
and
be
all
the
firmer
from
having
had
my
example
then
you
want
to
inure
the
youth
to
seeing
blood
flow
at
his
tender
age
to
be
accustomed
to
fires
murders
gibbets
riots
night
attacks
to
see
queens
insulted
and
kings
badgered
and
when
he
is
cool
like
you
and
steel
like
a
do
you
expect
he
will
love
and
respect
you
no
i
do
not
want
him
to
see
any
such
sights
which
is
why
i
have
sent
him
down
to
villers
cotterets
along
with
ange
pitou
though
i
almost
regret
it
at
present
you
say
you
are
sorry
for
it
why
because
he
would
have
seen
the
fable
of
the
lion
and
the
mouse
put
in
action
which
would
be
reality
to
him
henceforth
what
do
you
mean
dr
gilbert
i
say
that
he
would
have
seen
a
brave
and
honest
farmer
come
to
town
one
who
can
neither
read
nor
write
who
never
dreamed
that
his
life
could
have
any
influence
good
or
bad
over
the
highest
destinies
he
would
have
seen
that
this
man
who
was
about
to
quit
paris
as
he
wishes
once
more
to
do
contribute
efficaciously
towards
saving
the
king
the
queen
and
the
two
royal
children
how
is
this
dr
gilbert
asked
billet
staring
how
sublimely
innocent
you
are
i
will
tell
you
did
you
not
awake
at
the
first
noise
in
the
night
guess
that
the
tumult
was
a
tempest
about
to
break
on
the
royal
residence
and
run
to
arouse
general
lafayette
for
the
general
was
sleeping
that
was
natural
enough
he
had
been
riding
about
for
twelve
hours
he
had
not
been
abed
for
you
led
him
to
the
palace
continued
gilbert
you
led
him
into
the
thick
of
the
scoundrels
crying
back
villains
the
revenger
is
upon
ye
that
right
enough
i
did
that
well
billet
my
friend
you
see
that
you
have
great
compensation
though
you
could
not
prevent
this
young
gentleman
from
being
butchered
you
did
perhaps
stay
the
great
crime
of
the
slaughter
of
the
royal
family
ingrate
would
you
leave
your
country
service
just
when
such
a
mighty
reward
was
yours
but
who
would
know
anything
about
it
when
i
never
suspected
it
myself
you
and
i
billet
is
not
that
enough
the
farmer
meditated
for
a
while
before
he
said
as
he
held
out
his
hand
to
the
physician
i
guess
you
are
right
doctor
but
you
know
man
is
a
weak
selfish
unsteady
creature
you
are
the
only
one
who
is
just
the
other
style
what
made
you
so
misfortune
replied
the
other
with
a
smile
filled
with
more
grief
than
a
sob
lord
how
singular
i
thought
misfortune
soured
a
man
weak
men
yes
but
if
i
were
to
meet
misfortune
and
it
was
to
make
me
wicked
you
may
meet
misfortune
but
you
will
never
become
wicked
i
answer
for
that
then
sighed
billet
i
shall
stay
and
see
the
game
out
but
i
shall
show
the
white
feather
more
than
once
like
this
but
i
shall
be
at
hand
to
uphold
you
so
be
it
said
the
farmer
throwing
a
lazy
look
on
viscount
body
which
servants
came
to
remove
he
said
what
a
vastly
pretty
boy
he
was
with
his
laughing
eye
when
he
rode
along
on
his
little
grey
with
the
basket
and
the
purse
poor
little
master
charny
poor
billet
he
had
not
the
mesmerist
prophetic
soul
and
he
could
not
dream
what
events
we
have
to
trace
now
that
the
king
and
queen
have
started
to
paris
to
follow
the
road
marked
by
the
redhot
plowshare
now
that
charny
begins
to
see
what
a
winsome
and
noble
wife
he
has
now
that
our
