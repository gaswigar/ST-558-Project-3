the
man
in
the
laboratory
the
room
was
a
small
one
and
had
been
chosen
for
its
remoteness
from
the
dwelling
rooms
it
had
formed
the
billiard
room
which
the
former
owner
of
weald
lodge
had
added
to
his
premises
and
john
minute
who
had
neither
the
time
nor
the
patience
for
billiards
had
readily
handed
over
this
damp
annex
to
his
scientific
secretary
along
one
side
ran
a
plain
deal
bench
which
was
crowded
with
glass
stills
and
test
tubes
in
the
middle
was
as
plain
a
table
with
half
a
dozen
books
a
microscope
under
a
glass
shade
a
little
wooden
case
which
was
opened
to
display
an
array
of
delicate
scientific
instruments
a
bunsen
burner
which
was
burning
bluely
under
a
small
glass
bowl
half
filled
with
a
dark
and
turgid
concoction
of
some
kind
the
face
of
the
man
sitting
at
the
table
watching
this
unsavory
stew
was
hidden
behind
a
mica
and
rubber
mask
for
the
fumes
which
were
being
given
off
by
the
fluid
were
neither
pleasant
nor
healthy
save
for
a
shaded
light
upon
the
table
and
the
blue
glow
of
the
bunsen
lamp
the
room
was
in
darkness
now
and
again
the
student
would
take
a
glass
rod
dip
it
for
an
instant
into
the
boiling
liquid
and
lifting
it
would
allow
the
liquid
drop
by
drop
to
fall
from
the
rod
on
to
a
strip
of
litmus
paper
what
he
saw
was
evidently
satisfactory
and
presently
he
turned
out
the
bunsen
lamp
walked
to
the
window
and
opened
it
and
switched
on
an
electric
fan
to
aid
the
process
of
ventilation
he
removed
his
mask
revealing
the
face
of
a
young
man
rather
pale
with
a
slight
dark
mustache
and
heavy
black
wavy
hair
he
closed
the
window
filled
his
pipe
from
the
pouch
which
he
took
from
his
pocket
and
began
to
write
in
a
notebook
stopping
now
and
again
to
consult
some
authority
from
the
books
before
him
in
half
an
hour
he
had
finished
this
work
had
blotted
and
closed
his
book
and
pushing
back
his
chair
gave
himself
up
to
reverie
they
were
not
pleasant
thoughts
to
judge
by
his
face
he
pulled
from
his
inside
pocket
a
leather
case
and
opened
it
from
this
he
took
a
photograph
it
was
the
picture
of
a
girl
of
sixteen
it
was
a
pretty
face
a
little
sad
but
attractive
in
its
very
weakness
he
looked
at
it
for
a
long
time
shaking
his
head
as
at
an
unpleasant
thought
there
came
a
gentle
tap
at
the
door
and
quickly
he
replaced
the
photograph
in
his
case
folded
it
and
returned
it
to
his
pocket
as
he
rose
to
unlock
the
door
john
minute
who
entered
sniffed
suspiciously
what
beastly
smells
you
have
in
here
jasper
he
growled
why
on
earth
do
they
invent
chemicals
that
are
more
agreeable
to
the
nose
jasper
cole
laughed
quietly
i
afraid
sir
that
nature
has
ordered
it
otherwise
he
said
have
you
finished
asked
his
employer
he
looked
at
the
still
warm
bowl
of
fluid
suspiciously
it
is
all
right
sir
said
jasper
it
is
only
noxious
when
it
is
boiling
that
is
why
i
keep
the
door
locked
what
is
it
asked
john
minute
scowling
down
at
the
unoffending
liquor
it
is
many
things
said
the
other
ruefully
in
point
of
fact
it
is
an
experiment
the
bowl
contains
one
or
two
elements
which
will
only
mix
with
the
others
at
a
certain
temperature
and
as
an
experiment
it
is
successful
because
i
have
kept
the
unmixable
elements
in
suspension
though
the
liquid
has
gone
cold
i
hope
you
will
enjoy
your
dinner
even
though
it
has
gone
cold
grumbled
john
minute
i
did
hear
the
bell
sir
said
jasper
cole
i
awfully
sorry
if
i
kept
you
waiting
they
were
the
only
two
present
in
the
big
dining
room
and
dinner
was
as
usual
a
fairly
silent
meal
john
minute
read
the
newspapers
particularly
that
portion
of
them
which
dealt
with
the
latest
fluctuations
in
the
stock
market
somebody
has
been
buying
gwelo
deeps
he
complained
loudly
jasper
looked
up
gwelo
deeps
he
said
but
they
are
the
shares
yes
yes
said
the
other
testily
i
know
they
were
quoted
at
a
shilling
last
week
they
are
up
to
two
shillings
and
threepence
got
five
hundred
thousand
of
them
to
be
exact
he
corrected
himself
i
got
a
million
of
them
though
half
of
them
are
not
my
property
i
am
almost
tempted
to
sell
perhaps
they
have
found
gold
suggested
jasper
john
minute
snorted
if
there
is
gold
in
the
gwelo
deeps
there
are
diamonds
on
the
downs
he
said
scornfully
by
the
way
the
other
five
hundred
thousand
shares
belong
to
may
jasper
cole
raised
his
eyebrows
as
much
in
interrogation
as
in
surprise
john
minute
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
manipulated
his
gold
toothpick
may
nuttall
father
was
the
best
friend
i
ever
had
he
said
gruffly
he
lured
me
into
the
gwelo
deeps
against
my
better
judgment
we
sank
a
bore
three
thousand
feet
and
found
everything
except
gold
he
gave
one
of
his
brief
rumbling
chuckles
i
wish
that
mine
had
been
a
success
poor
old
bill
nuttall
he
helped
me
in
some
tight
places
and
i
think
you
have
done
your
best
for
his
daughter
sir
she
a
nice
girl
said
john
minute
a
dear
girl
i
not
taken
with
girls
he
made
a
wry
face
but
may
is
as
honest
and
as
sweet
as
they
make
them
she
the
sort
of
girl
who
looks
you
in
the
eye
when
she
talks
to
you
there
no
damned
nonsense
about
may
jasper
cole
concealed
a
smile
what
the
devil
are
you
grinning
at
demanded
john
minute
i
also
was
thinking
that
there
was
no
nonsense
about
her
he
said
john
minute
swung
round
jasper
he
said
may
is
the
kind
of
girl
i
would
like
you
to
marry
in
fact
she
the
girl
i
would
like
you
to
marry
i
think
frank
would
have
something
to
say
about
that
said
the
other
stirring
his
coffee
frank
snorted
john
minute
what
the
devil
do
i
care
about
frank
frank
has
to
do
as
he
told
he
a
lucky
young
man
and
a
bit
of
a
rascal
too
i
thinking
frank
would
marry
anybody
with
a
pretty
face
why
if
i
had
interfered
jasper
looked
up
yes
never
mind
growled
john
minute
as
was
his
practice
he
sat
a
long
time
over
dinner
half
awake
and
half
asleep
jasper
had
annexed
one
of
the
newspapers
and
was
reading
it
this
was
the
routine
which
marked
every
evening
of
his
life
save
on
those
occasions
when
he
made
a
visit
to
london
he
was
in
the
midst
of
an
article
by
a
famous
scientist
on
radium
emanation
when
john
minute
continued
a
conversation
which
he
had
broken
off
an
hour
ago
i
worried
about
may
sometimes
jasper
put
down
his
paper
worried
why
i
am
worried
is
that
enough
growled
the
other
i
wish
you
would
ask
me
a
lot
of
questions
jasper
you
irritate
me
beyond
endurance
well
i
take
it
that
you
worried
said
his
confidential
secretary
patiently
and
that
you
good
reason
i
feel
responsible
for
her
and
i
hate
responsibilities
of
all
kinds
the
responsibilities
of
children
he
winced
and
changed
the
subject
nor
did
he
return
to
it
for
several
days
instead
he
opened
up
a
new
line
sergeant
smith
was
here
when
i
was
out
i
understand
he
said
he
came
this
afternoon
yes
did
you
see
him
jasper
nodded
what
did
he
want
he
wanted
to
see
you
as
far
as
i
could
make
out
you
were
saying
the
other
day
that
he
drinks
drinks
said
the
other
scornfully
he
does
drink
he
eats
it
what
do
you
think
about
sergeant
smith
he
demanded
i
think
he
is
a
very
curious
person
said
the
other
frankly
and
i
ca
understand
why
you
go
to
such
trouble
to
shield
him
or
why
you
send
him
money
every
week
one
of
these
days
you
understand
said
the
other
and
his
prophecy
was
to
be
fulfilled
for
the
present
it
is
enough
to
say
that
if
there
are
two
ways
out
of
a
difficulty
one
of
which
is
unpleasant
and
one
of
which
is
less
unpleasant
i
take
the
less
unpleasant
of
the
two
it
is
less
unpleasant
to
pay
sergeant
smith
a
weekly
stipend
than
it
is
to
be
annoyed
and
i
should
most
certainly
be
annoyed
if
i
did
not
pay
him
he
rose
up
slowly
from
the
chair
and
stretched
himself
sergeant
smith
he
said
again
is
a
pretty
tough
proposition
i
know
and
i
have
known
him
for
years
in
my
business
jasper
i
have
had
to
know
some
queer
people
and
i
had
to
do
some
queer
things
i
am
not
so
sure
that
they
would
look
well
in
print
though
i
am
not
sensitive
as
to
what
newspapers
say
about
me
or
i
should
have
been
in
my
grave
years
ago
but
sergeant
smith
and
his
knowledge
touches
me
at
a
raw
place
you
are
always
messing
about
with
narcotics
and
muck
of
all
kinds
and
you
will
understand
when
i
tell
you
that
the
money
i
give
sergeant
smith
every
week
serves
a
double
purpose
it
is
an
opiate
and
a
prophy
prophylactic
suggested
the
other
that
the
word
said
john
minute
i
was
never
a
whale
at
the
long
uns
when
i
was
twelve
i
could
write
my
own
name
and
when
i
was
nineteen
i
used
to
spell
it
with
two
n
he
chuckled
again
opiate
and
prophylactic
he
repeated
nodding
his
head
sergeant
smith
he
is
a
dangerous
devil
because
he
is
a
rascal
constable
wiseman
began
jasper
constable
wiseman
snapped
john
minute
rubbing
his
hand
through
his
rumpled
gray
hair
is
a
dangerous
devil
because
he
a
fool
what
has
constable
wiseman
been
here
about
he
did
come
here
smiled
jasper
i
met
him
on
the
road
and
had
a
little
talk
with
him
you
might
have
been
better
employed
said
john
minute
gruffly
that
silly
ass
has
summoned
me
three
times
one
of
these
days
i
get
him
thrown
out
of
the
force
he
not
a
bad
sort
of
fellow
soothed
jasper
cole
he
rather
stupid
but
otherwise
he
is
a
decent
man
with
a
sense
of
the
law
did
he
say
anything
worth
repeating
asked
john
minute
he
was
saying
that
sergeant
smith
is
a
disciplinarian
i
know
of
nobody
more
of
a
disciplinarian
than
sergeant
smith
said
the
other
sarcastically
particularly
when
he
is
getting
over
a
jag
the
keenest
sense
of
duty
is
that
possessed
by
a
man
who
has
broken
the
law
and
has
not
been
found
out
i
think
i
will
go
to
bed
he
added
looking
at
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
i
am
going
up
to
town
i
want
to
see
may
is
anything
worrying
you
asked
jasper
the
bank
is
worrying
me
said
the
old
man
jasper
cole
looked
at
him
steadily
what
wrong
with
the
bank
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
bank
and
the
knowledge
that
my
dear
nephew
frank
merrill
esquire
is
accountant
at
one
of
its
branches
removes
any
lingering
doubt
in
my
mind
as
to
its
stability
and
i
wish
to
heaven
you
get
out
of
the
habit
of
asking
me
this
happens
or
i
do
that
jasper
lit
a
cigar
before
replying
the
only
way
you
can
find
things
out
in
this
world
is
by
asking
questions
well
ask
somebody
else
boomed
john
minute
at
the
door
jasper
took
up
his
paper
but
was
not
to
be
left
to
the
enjoyment
its
columns
offered
for
five
minutes
later
john
minute
appeared
in
the
doorway
minus
his
tie
and
coat
having
been
surprised
in
the
act
of
undressing
with
an
idea
which
called
for
development
send
a
cable
in
the
morning
to
the
manager
of
the
gwelo
deeps
and
ask
him
if
there
is
any
report
by
the
way
you
are
the
secretary
of
the
company
i
suppose
you
know
that
am
i
asked
the
startled
jasper
frank
was
and
i
do
suppose
he
has
been
doing
the
work
now
you
had
better
find
out
or
you
will
be
getting
me
into
a
lot
of
trouble
with
the
registrar
we
ought
to
have
a
board
meeting
am
i
the
directors
too
asked
jasper
innocently
it
is
very
likely
said
john
minute
i
know
i
am
chairman
but
there
has
never
been
any
need
to
hold
a
meeting
you
had
better
find
out
from
frank
when
the
last
was
held
he
went
away
to
reappear
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
this
time
in
his
pajamas
that
mission
may
is
running
he
began
they
are
probably
short
of
money
you
might
inquire
of
their
secretary
will
have
a
secretary
i
be
bound
if
they
want
anything
send
it
on
to
them
he
walked
to
the
sideboard
and
mixed
himself
a
whisky
and
soda
i
been
out
the
last
three
or
four
times
smith
has
called
if
he
comes
tell
him
i
will
see
him
when
i
return
bolt
the
doors
and
do
leave
it
to
that
jackass
wilkins
jasper
nodded
you
think
i
am
a
little
mad
do
you
jasper
asked
the
older
man
standing
by
the
sideboard
with
the
glass
in
his
hand
that
thought
has
never
occurred
to
me
said
jasper
i
think
you
are
eccentric
sometimes
and
inclined
to
exaggerate
the
dangers
which
surround
you
the
other
shook
his
head
i
shall
die
a
violent
death
i
know
it
when
i
was
in
zululand
an
old
witch
doctor
the
bones
you
have
never
had
that
experience
i
ca
say
that
i
have
said
jasper
with
a
little
smile
you
can
laugh
at
that
sort
of
thing
but
i
tell
you
i
got
a
great
faith
in
it
once
in
the
king
kraal
and
once
in
echowe
it
happened
and
both
witch
doctors
told
me
the
same
thing
that
i
die
by
violence
i
did
use
to
worry
about
it
very
much
but
i
suppose
i
growing
old
now
and
living
surrounded
by
the
law
as
it
were
i
am
too
a
man
is
one
who
is
afraid
of
people
who
are
not
and
i
am
getting
to
that
stage
you
laugh
at
me
because
jumpy
whenever
i
see
a
stranger
hanging
around
the
house
but
i
have
got
more
enemies
to
the
square
yard
than
most
people
have
to
the
county
i
suppose
you
think
i
am
subject
to
delusions
and
ought
to
be
put
under
restraint
a
rich
man
has
a
very
happy
time
he
went
on
speaking
half
to
himself
and
half
to
the
young
man
i
met
all
sorts
of
people
in
this
country
and
been
introduced
as
john
minute
the
millionaire
and
do
you
know
what
they
say
as
soon
as
my
back
is
turned
jasper
offered
no
suggestion
they
say
this
john
minute
went
on
whether
they
young
or
old
good
bad
or
indifferent
wish
he
die
and
leave
me
some
of
his
money
jasper
laughed
softly
you
have
a
very
good
opinion
of
humanity
i
have
no
opinion
of
humanity
corrected
his
chief
and
i
am
going
to
bed
jasper
heard
his
heavy
feet
upon
the
stairs
and
the
thud
of
them
overhead
he
waited
for
some
time
then
he
heard
the
bed
creak
he
closed
the
windows
personally
inspected
the
fastenings
of
the
doors
and
went
to
his
little
office
study
on
the
first
floor
he
shut
the
door
took
out
the
pocket
case
and
gave
one
glance
at
the
portrait
and
then
took
an
unopened
letter
which
had
come
that
evening
and
which
by
his
deft
handling
of
the
mail
he
had
been
able
to
smuggle
into
his
pocket
without
john
minute
observance
he
slit
open
the
envelope
extracted
the
letter
and
read
dear
sir
your
esteemed
favor
is
to
hand
we
have
to
thank
you
for
the
check
and
we
are
very
pleased
that
we
have
given
you
satisfactory
service
the
search
has
been
a
very
long
and
i
am
afraid
a
very
expensive
one
to
yourself
but
now
that
discovery
has
been
made
i
trust
you
will
feel
rewarded
for
your
energies
the
note
bore
no
heading
and
was
signed

chapter
ii
the
girl
who
cried
the
northern
express
had
deposited
its
passengers
at
king
cross
on
time
all
the
station
approaches
were
crowded
with
hurrying
passengers
taxicabs
and
growlers
were
mixed
in
apparently
inextricable
confusion
there
was
a
roaring
babble
of
instruction
and
from
from
cab
drivers
and
from
excited
porters
some
of
the
passengers
hurried
swiftly
across
the
broad
asphalt
space
and
disappeared
down
the
stairs
toward
the
underground
station
others
waited
for
unpunctual
friends
with
protesting
and
frequent
examination
of
their
watches
one
alone
seemed
wholly
bewildered
by
the
noise
and
commotion
she
was
a
young
girl
not
more
than
eighteen
and
she
struggled
with
two
or
three
brown
paper
parcels
a
and
a
bulky
she
was
among
those
who
expected
to
be
met
at
the
station
for
she
looked
helplessly
at
the
clock
and
wandered
from
one
side
of
the
building
to
the
other
till
at
last
she
came
to
a
standstill
in
the
center
put
down
all
her
parcels
carefully
and
taking
a
letter
from
a
shabby
little
bag
opened
it
and
read
evidently
she
saw
something
which
she
had
not
noticed
before
for
she
hastily
replaced
the
letter
in
the
bag
scrambled
together
her
parcels
and
walked
swiftly
out
of
the
station
again
she
came
to
a
halt
and
looked
round
the
darkened
courtyard
here
snapped
a
voice
irritably
she
saw
a
door
of
a
taxicab
open
and
came
toward
it
timidly
come
in
come
in
for
heaven
sake
said
the
voice
she
put
in
her
parcels
and
stepped
into
the
cab
the
owner
of
the
voice
closed
the
door
with
a
bang
and
the
taxi
moved
on
i
been
waiting
here
ten
minutes
said
the
man
in
the
cab
i
so
sorry
dear
but
i
did
read
of
course
you
did
read
interrupted
the
other
brusquely
it
was
the
voice
of
a
young
man
not
in
the
best
of
tempers
and
the
girl
folding
her
hands
in
her
lap
prepared
for
the
tirade
which
she
knew
was
to
follow
her
act
of
omission
you
never
seem
to
be
able
to
do
anything
right
said
the
man
i
suppose
it
is
your
natural
stupidity
why
could
you
meet
me
inside
the
station
she
asked
with
some
show
of
spirit
i
told
you
a
dozen
times
that
i
do
want
to
be
seen
with
you
said
the
man
brutally
i
had
enough
trouble
over
you
already
i
wish
to
heaven
i
never
met
you
the
girl
could
have
echoed
that
wish
but
eighteen
months
of
bullying
had
cowed
and
all
but
broken
her
spirit
you
are
a
stone
around
my
neck
said
the
man
bitterly
i
have
to
hide
you
and
all
the
time
i
in
a
fret
as
to
whether
you
will
give
me
away
or
not
i
am
going
to
keep
you
under
my
eye
now
he
said
you
know
a
little
too
much
about
me
i
should
never
say
a
word
against
you
protested
the
girl
i
hope
for
your
sake
you
do
was
the
grim
reply
the
conversation
slackened
from
this
moment
until
the
girl
plucked
up
courage
to
ask
where
they
were
going
wait
and
see
snapped
the
man
but
added
later
you
are
going
to
a
much
nicer
home
than
you
have
ever
had
in
your
life
and
you
ought
to
be
very
thankful
indeed
i
am
dear
said
the
girl
earnestly
do
call
me
snarled
her
husband
the
cab
took
them
to
camden
town
and
they
descended
in
front
of
a
house
in
a
long
dull
street
it
was
too
dark
for
the
girl
to
take
stock
of
her
surroundings
and
she
had
scarcely
time
to
gather
her
parcels
together
before
the
man
opened
the
door
and
pushed
her
in
the
cab
drove
off
and
a
motor
cyclist
who
all
the
time
had
been
following
the
taxi
wheeled
his
machine
slowly
from
the
corner
of
the
street
where
he
had
waited
until
he
came
opposite
the
house
he
let
down
the
supports
of
his
machine
went
stealthily
up
the
steps
and
flashed
a
lamp
upon
the
enamel
numbers
over
the
fanlight
of
the
door
he
jotted
down
the
figures
in
a
notebook
descended
the
steps
again
and
wheeling
his
machine
back
a
little
way
mounted
and
rode
off
half
an
hour
later
another
cab
pulled
up
at
the
door
and
a
man
descended
telling
the
driver
to
wait
he
mounted
the
steps
knocked
and
after
a
short
delay
was
admitted
hello
crawley
said
the
man
who
had
opened
the
door
to
him
how
goes
it
rotten
said
the
newcomer
what
do
you
want
me
for
his
was
the
voice
of
an
uncultured
man
but
his
tone
was
that
of
an
equal
what
do
you
think
i
want
you
for
asked
the
other
savagely
he
led
the
way
to
the
sitting
room
struck
a
match
and
lit
the
gas
his
bag
was
on
the
floor
he
picked
it
up
opened
it
and
took
out
a
flask
of
whisky
which
he
handed
to
the
other
i
thought
you
might
need
it
he
said
sarcastically
crawley
took
the
flask
poured
out
a
stiff
tot
and
drank
it
at
a
gulp
he
was
a
man
of
fifty
dark
and
dour
his
face
was
lined
and
tanned
as
one
who
had
lived
for
many
years
in
a
hot
climate
this
was
true
of
him
for
he
had
spent
ten
years
of
his
life
in
the
matabeleland
mounted
police
the
young
man
pulled
up
a
chair
to
the
table
i
got
an
offer
to
make
to
you
he
said
is
there
any
money
in
it
the
other
laughed
you
do
suppose
i
should
make
any
kind
of
offer
to
you
that
money
in
it
he
answered
contemptuously
crawley
after
a
moment
hesitation
poured
out
another
drink
and
gulped
it
down
i
have
had
a
drink
he
said
apologetically
that
is
an
obvious
lie
said
the
younger
man
but
now
to
get
to
business
i
do
know
what
your
game
is
in
england
but
i
will
tell
you
what
mine
is
i
want
a
free
hand
and
i
can
only
have
a
free
hand
if
you
take
your
daughter
away
out
of
the
country
you
want
to
get
rid
of
her
eh
asked
the
other
looking
at
him
shrewdly
the
young
man
nodded
i
tell
you
she
a
millstone
round
my
neck
he
said
for
the
second
time
that
evening
and
i
am
scared
of
her
at
any
moment
she
may
do
some
fool
thing
and
ruin
me
crawley
grinned
better
or
for
worse
he
quoted
and
then
seeing
the
ugly
look
in
the
other
man
face
he
said
do
try
to
frighten
me
brown
or
jones
or
whatever
you
call
yourself
because
i
ca
be
frightened
i
have
had
to
deal
with
worse
men
than
you
and
i
still
alive
tell
you
right
now
that
i
not
going
out
of
england
i
got
a
big
game
on
what
did
you
think
of
offering
me
a
thousand
pounds
said
the
other
i
thought
it
would
be
something
like
that
said
crawley
coolly
it
is
a
to
me
you
take
my
tip
and
find
another
way
of
keeping
her
quiet
a
clever
fellow
like
you
who
knows
more
about
dope
than
any
other
man
i
have
met
ought
to
be
able
to
do
the
trick
without
any
assistance
from
me
why
did
you
tell
me
that
you
knew
a
drug
that
sapped
the
will
power
of
people
and
made
them
do
just
as
you
like
that
the
knockout
drop
to
give
her
take
my
tip
and
try
it
you
wo
accept
my
offer
asked
the
other
crawley
shook
his
head
i
got
a
fortune
in
my
hand
if
i
work
my
cards
right
he
said
managed
to
get
a
position
right
under
the
old
devil
nose
i
see
him
every
day
and
i
have
got
him
scared
what
a
thousand
pounds
to
me
i
lost
more
than
a
thousand
on
one
race
at
lewes
no
my
boy
employ
the
resources
of
science
he
said
flippantly
there
no
sense
in
being
a
dope
merchant
if
you
ca
get
the
right
dope
for
the
right
case
the
less
you
say
about
my
doping
the
better
snarled
the
other
man
i
was
a
fool
to
take
you
so
much
into
my
confidence
do
lose
your
temper
said
the
other
raising
his
hand
in
mock
alarm
lord
bless
us
wright
or
robinson
who
would
have
thought
that
the
nice
young
man
who
goes
to
church
in
eastbourne
could
be
such
a
fierce
chap
in
london
i
often
laughed
seeing
you
walk
past
me
as
though
butter
would
melt
in
your
mouth
and
everybody
saying
what
a
nice
young
man
is
and
i
have
thought
if
they
only
knew
that
this
sleek
lad
shut
up
said
the
other
savagely
you
are
getting
as
much
of
a
danger
as
this
infernal
girl
you
take
things
too
much
to
heart
said
the
other
now
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
am
not
going
out
of
england
i
am
going
to
keep
my
present
menial
job
you
see
it
is
only
the
question
of
money
but
i
have
an
idea
that
your
old
man
has
got
something
up
his
sleeve
for
me
and
the
only
way
to
prevent
unpleasant
happenings
is
to
keep
close
to
him
i
have
told
you
a
dozen
times
he
has
nothing
against
you
said
the
other
emphatically
i
know
his
business
and
i
have
seen
most
of
his
private
papers
if
he
could
have
caught
you
with
the
goods
he
would
have
had
you
long
ago
i
told
you
that
the
last
time
you
called
at
the
house
and
i
saw
you
what
do
you
think
john
minute
would
pay
blackmail
if
he
could
get
out
of
it
you
are
a
fool
maybe
i
am
said
the
other
philosophically
but
i
am
not
such
a
fool
as
you
think
me
to
be
you
had
better
see
her
said
his
host
suddenly
crawley
shook
his
head
a
parent
feelings
he
protested
have
a
sense
of
decency
reginald
or
horace
or
hector
i
always
forget
your
london
name
no
he
said
i
wo
accept
your
suggestion
but
i
have
got
a
proposition
to
make
to
you
and
it
concerns
a
certain
relative
of
john
minute
a
nice
young
fellow
who
will
one
day
secure
the
old
man
swag
will
he
said
the
other
between
his
teeth
they
sat
for
two
hours
discussing
the
proposition
and
then
crawley
rose
to
leave
i
leave
my
final
jar
for
the
last
he
said
pleasantly
he
had
finished
the
contents
of
the
flask
and
was
in
a
very
amiable
frame
of
mind
you
are
in
some
danger
my
young
friend
and
i
your
guardian
angel
have
discovered
it
you
have
a
valet
at
one
of
your
numerous
addresses
a
chauffeur
corrected
the
other
a
swede
jonsen
crawley
nodded
i
thought
he
was
a
swede
have
you
seen
him
asked
the
other
quickly
he
came
down
to
make
some
inquiries
in
eastbourne
said
crawley
and
i
happened
to
meet
him
one
of
those
talkative
fellows
who
opens
his
heart
to
a
uniform
i
stopped
him
from
going
to
the
house
so
i
saved
you
a
shock
if
john
minute
had
been
there
i
mean
the
other
bit
his
lips
and
his
face
showed
his
concern
that
bad
he
said
he
has
been
very
restless
and
rather
impertinent
lately
and
has
been
looking
for
another
job
what
did
you
tell
him
i
told
him
to
come
down
next
wednesday
said
crawley
i
thought
like
to
make
a
few
arrangements
in
the
meantime
he
held
out
his
hand
and
the
young
man
who
did
not
mistake
the
gesture
dived
into
his
pockets
with
a
scowl
and
handed
four
notes
into
the
outstretched
palm
it
will
just
pay
my
taxi
said
crawley
the
other
went
upstairs
he
found
the
girl
sitting
where
he
had
left
her
in
her
bedroom
clear
out
of
here
he
said
roughly
i
want
the
room
meekly
she
obeyed
he
locked
the
door
behind
her
lifted
a
suitcase
on
to
the
bed
and
opening
it
took
out
a
small
japanese
box
from
this
he
removed
a
tiny
glass
pestle
and
mortar
six
little
vials
a
hypodermic
syringe
and
a
small
spirit
lamp
then
from
his
pocket
he
took
a
cigarette
case
and
removed
two
cigarettes
which
he
laid
carefully
on
the
dressing
table
he
was
busy
for
the
greater
part
of
the
hour
as
for
the
girl
she
spent
that
time
in
the
cold
dining
room
huddled
up
in
a
chair
weeping
softly
to
herself
chapter
iii
four
important
characters
the
writer
pauses
here
to
say
that
the
story
of
the
man
who
knew
is
an
unusual
one
it
is
reconstructed
partly
from
the
reports
of
a
certain
trial
partly
from
the
confidential
matter
which
has
come
into
the
writer
hands
from
saul
arthur
mann
and
his
extraordinary
bureau
and
partly
from
the
private
diary
which
may
nuttall
put
at
the
disposal
those
practiced
readers
who
begin
this
narrative
with
the
weary
conviction
that
they
are
merely
to
see
the
workings
out
of
a
conventional
record
of
crime
of
love
and
of
mystery
may
be
urged
to
pursue
their
investigations
to
the
end
truth
is
stranger
than
fiction
and
has
need
to
be
since
most
fiction
is
founded
on
truth
there
is
a
strangeness
in
the
story
of
the
man
who
knew
which
brings
it
into
the
category
of
veracious
history
it
can
not
be
said
in
truth
that
any
story
begins
at
the
beginning
of
the
first
chapter
since
all
stories
began
with
the
creation
of
the
world
but
this
present
story
may
be
said
to
begin
when
we
cut
into
the
lives
of
some
of
the
characters
concerned
upon
the
seventeenth
day
of
july
there
was
a
little
group
of
people
about
the
prostrate
figure
of
a
man
who
lay
upon
the
sidewalk
in
gray
square
bloomsbury
the
hour
was
eight
on
a
warm
summer
evening
and
that
the
unusual
spectacle
attracted
only
a
small
crowd
may
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
gray
square
is
a
professional
quarter
given
up
to
the
offices
of
lawyers
surveyors
and
corporation
offices
which
at
eight
on
a
summer
day
are
empty
of
occupants
the
unprofessional
classes
who
inhabit
the
shabby
streets
impinging
upon
the
euston
road
do
not
include
gray
square
in
their
itinerary
when
they
take
their
evening
constitutionals
abroad
and
even
the
loud
children
find
a
less
depressing
environment
for
their
games
the
youth
sprawled
upon
the
pavement
was
decently
dressed
and
was
obviously
of
the
superior
servant
type
he
was
as
obviously
dead
death
which
beautifies
and
softens
the
plainest
had
failed
entirely
to
dissipate
the
impression
of
meanness
in
the
face
of
the
stricken
man
the
lips
were
set
in
a
little
sneer
the
eyes
were
small
the
jaw
was
long
and
underhung
the
ears
were
large
and
grotesquely
prominent
a
constable
stood
by
the
body
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
the
ambulance
answering
in
monosyllables
the
questions
of
the
curious
ten
minutes
before
the
ambulance
arrived
there
joined
the
group
a
man
of
middle
age
he
wore
the
suit
which
distinguishes
the
country
excursionist
taking
the
day
off
in
london
he
had
little
side
whiskers
and
a
heavy
brown
mustache
his
golf
cap
was
new
and
set
at
a
somewhat
rakish
angle
on
his
head
across
his
waistcoat
was
a
large
and
heavy
chain
hung
at
intervals
with
small
silver
medals
for
all
his
provincial
appearance
his
movements
were
decisive
and
suggested
authority
he
elbowed
his
way
through
the
little
crowd
and
met
the
disapproving
stare
without
faltering
can
i
be
of
any
help
mate
he
said
and
introduced
himself
as
police
constable
wiseman
of
the
sussex
constabulary
the
london
constable
thawed
thanks
he
said
you
can
help
me
get
him
into
the
ambulance
when
it
comes
fit
asked
the
newcomer
the
policeman
shook
his
head
he
was
seen
to
stagger
and
fall
and
by
the
time
i
arrived
he
snuffed
out
heart
disease
i
suppose
ah
said
constable
wiseman
regarding
the
body
with
a
proprietorial
and
professional
eye
and
retailed
his
own
experiences
of
similar
tragedies
not
without
pride
as
though
he
had
to
some
extent
the
responsibility
for
their
occurrence
on
the
far
side
of
the
square
a
young
man
and
a
girl
were
walking
slowly
a
tall
fair
youth
he
was
who
might
have
attracted
attention
even
in
a
crowd
but
more
likely
would
that
attention
have
been
focused
had
he
been
accompanied
by
the
girl
at
his
side
for
she
was
by
every
standard
beautiful
they
reached
the
corner
of
tabor
street
and
it
was
the
fixed
and
eager
stare
of
a
little
man
who
stood
on
the
corner
of
the
street
and
the
intensity
of
his
gaze
which
first
directed
their
attention
to
the
tragedy
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
square
the
little
man
who
watched
was
dressed
in
an
frock
coat
trousers
which
seemed
too
long
since
they
concertinaed
over
his
boots
and
a
glossy
silk
hat
set
at
the
back
of
his
head
what
a
funny
old
thing
said
frank
merrill
under
his
breath
and
the
girl
smiled
the
object
of
their
amusement
turned
sharply
as
they
came
abreast
of
him
his
freckled
face
looked
strangely
old
and
the
big
spectacles
bridged
halfway
down
his
nose
added
to
his
ludicrous
appearance
he
raised
his
eyebrows
and
surveyed
the
two
young
people
there
an
accident
over
there
he
said
briefly
and
without
any
preliminary
indeed
said
the
young
man
politely
there
have
been
several
accidents
in
gray
square
said
the
strange
old
man
meditatively
there
was
one
in
when
the
corner
house
you
can
see
the
end
of
it
from
here
collapsed
and
buried
fourteen
people
seven
of
whom
were
killed
four
of
whom
were
injured
for
life
and
three
of
whom
escaped
with
minor
injuries
he
said
this
calmly
and
apparently
without
any
sense
that
he
was
acting
at
all
unconventionally
in
volunteering
the
information
and
went
on
there
was
another
accident
in
on
the
seventeenth
of
october
a
collision
between
two
hansom
cabs
which
resulted
in
the
death
of
a
driver
whose
name
was
samuel
green
he
lived
at
portington
mews
and
had
a
wife
and
nine
children
the
girl
looked
at
the
old
man
with
a
little
apprehension
and
frank
merrill
laughed
you
have
a
very
good
memory
for
this
kind
of
thing
do
you
live
here
he
asked
oh
no
the
little
man
shook
his
head
vigorously
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
i
think
we
had
better
go
over
and
see
what
it
is
all
about
he
said
with
a
certain
gravity
his
assumption
of
leadership
was
a
little
staggering
and
frank
turned
to
the
girl
do
you
mind
he
asked
she
shook
her
head
and
the
three
passed
over
the
road
to
the
little
group
just
as
the
ambulance
came
jangling
into
the
square
to
surprise
the
policeman
greeted
the
little
man
respectfully
touching
his
helmet
i
afraid
nothing
can
be
done
sir
he
is
gone
oh
yes
he
gone
said
the
other
quite
calmly
he
stooped
down
turned
back
the
man
coat
and
slipped
his
hand
into
the
inside
pocket
but
drew
blank
the
pocket
was
empty
with
an
extraordinary
rapidity
of
movement
he
continued
his
search
and
to
the
astonishment
of
frank
merrill
the
policeman
did
not
deny
his
right
in
the
top
pocket
of
the
waistcoat
he
pulled
out
a
crumpled
slip
which
proved
to
be
a
newspaper
clipping
ah
said
the
little
man
an
advertisement
for
a
manservant
cut
out
of
this
morning
i
saw
it
myself
evidently
a
manservant
who
was
on
his
way
to
interview
a
new
employer
you
see
at
at
holborn
viaduct
hotel
he
was
taking
a
short
cut
when
his
illness
overcame
him
i
know
who
is
advertising
for
the
valet
he
added
gratuitously
he
is
a
burton
who
is
a
rubber
factor
from
penang
burton
married
the
daughter
of
the
reverend
george
smith
of
scarborough
in
and
has
four
children
one
of
whom
is
at
winchester
hum
he
pursed
his
lips
and
looked
down
again
at
the
body
then
suddenly
he
turned
to
frank
merrill
do
you
know
this
man
he
demanded
frank
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
no
why
do
you
ask
you
were
looking
at
him
as
though
you
did
said
the
little
man
that
is
to
say
you
were
not
looking
at
his
face
people
who
do
not
look
at
other
people
faces
under
these
circumstances
know
them
curiously
enough
said
frank
with
a
little
smile
there
is
some
one
here
i
know
and
he
caught
the
eye
of
constable
wiseman
that
ornament
of
the
sussex
constabulary
touched
his
cap
i
thought
i
recognized
you
sir
i
have
often
seen
you
at
weald
lodge
he
said
further
conversation
was
cut
short
as
they
lifted
the
body
on
to
a
stretcher
and
put
it
into
the
interior
of
the
ambulance
the
little
group
watched
the
white
car
disappear
and
the
crowd
of
idlers
began
to
melt
away
constable
wiseman
took
a
professional
leave
of
his
comrade
and
came
back
to
frank
a
little
shyly
you
are
mr
minute
nephew
are
you
sir
he
asked
quite
right
said
frank
i
used
to
see
you
at
your
uncle
place
uncle
name
it
was
the
little
man
pert
but
wholly
inoffensive
inquiry
he
seemed
to
ask
it
as
a
matter
of
course
and
as
one
who
had
the
right
to
be
answered
without
equivocation
frank
merrill
laughed
my
uncle
is
john
minute
he
said
and
added
with
a
faint
touch
of
sarcasm
you
probably
know
him
oh
yes
said
the
other
readily
one
of
the
original
rhodesian
pioneers
who
received
a
concession
from
lo
bengula
and
amassed
a
large
fortune
by
the
sale
of
properties
which
proved
to
be
of
no
especial
value
he
was
tried
at
salisbury
in
with
the
murder
of
two
mashona
chiefs
and
was
acquitted
he
amassed
another
fortune
in
johannesburg
in
the
boom
of
and
came
to
this
country
in
settling
on
a
small
estate
between
polegate
and
eastbourne
he
has
one
nephew
his
heir
frank
merrill
the
son
of
the
late
doctor
henry
merrill
who
is
an
accountant
in
the
london
and
western
counties
bank
he
frank
looked
at
him
in
undisguised
amazement
you
know
my
uncle
never
met
him
in
my
life
said
the
little
man
brusquely
he
took
off
his
silk
hat
with
a
sweep
i
wish
you
good
afternoon
he
said
and
strode
rapidly
away
the
uniformed
policeman
turned
a
solemn
face
upon
the
group
do
you
know
that
gentleman
asked
frank
the
constable
smiled
oh
yes
sir
that
is
mann
at
the
yard
we
call
him
man
who
knows
is
he
a
detective
the
constable
shook
his
head
from
what
i
understand
sir
he
does
a
lot
of
work
for
the
commissioner
and
for
the
government
we
have
orders
never
to
interfere
with
him
or
refuse
him
any
information
that
we
can
give
the
man
who
knows
repeated
frank
with
a
puzzled
frown
what
an
extraordinary
person
what
does
he
know
he
asked
suddenly
everything
said
the
constable
comprehensively
a
few
minutes
later
frank
was
walking
slowly
toward
holborn
you
seem
to
be
rather
depressed
smiled
the
girl
confound
that
fellow
said
frank
breaking
his
silence
i
wonder
how
he
comes
to
know
all
about
uncle
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
well
dear
this
is
not
a
very
cheery
evening
for
you
i
did
not
bring
you
out
to
see
accidents
frank
the
girl
said
suddenly
i
seem
to
know
that
man
face
the
man
who
was
on
the
pavement
i
mean
she
stopped
with
a
shudder
it
seemed
a
little
familiar
to
me
said
frank
thoughtfully
did
he
pass
us
about
twenty
minutes
ago
he
may
have
done
said
frank
but
i
have
no
particular
recollection
of
it
my
impression
of
him
goes
much
farther
back
than
this
evening
now
where
could
i
have
seen
him
let
talk
about
something
else
she
said
quickly
i
have
a
very
long
time
what
am
i
to
do
about
your
uncle
he
laughed
i
hardly
know
what
to
suggest
he
said
i
am
very
fond
of
uncle
john
and
i
hate
to
run
counter
to
his
wishes
but
i
am
certainly
not
going
to
allow
him
to
take
my
love
affairs
into
his
hands
i
wish
to
heaven
you
had
never
met
him
she
gave
a
little
gesture
of
despair
it
is
no
use
wishing
things
like
that
frank
you
see
i
knew
your
uncle
before
i
knew
you
if
it
had
not
been
for
your
uncle
i
should
not
have
met
you
tell
me
what
happened
he
asked
he
looked
at
his
watch
you
had
better
come
on
to
victoria
he
said
or
i
shall
lose
my
train
he
hailed
a
taxicab
and
on
the
way
to
the
station
she
told
him
of
all
that
had
happened
he
was
very
nice
as
he
always
is
and
he
said
nothing
really
which
was
very
horrid
about
you
he
merely
said
he
did
not
want
me
to
marry
you
because
he
did
not
think
you
make
a
suitable
husband
he
said
that
jasper
had
all
the
qualities
and
most
of
the
virtues
frank
frowned
jasper
is
a
sleek
brute
he
said
viciously
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
please
be
patient
she
said
jasper
has
said
nothing
whatever
to
me
and
has
never
been
anything
but
most
polite
and
kind
i
know
that
variety
of
kindness
growled
the
young
man
he
is
one
of
those
sly
sneaks
you
can
never
get
to
the
bottom
of
he
is
worming
his
way
into
my
uncle
confidence
to
an
extraordinary
extent
why
he
is
more
like
a
son
to
uncle
john
than
a
beastly
secretary
he
has
made
himself
necessary
said
the
girl
and
that
is
halfway
to
making
yourself
wealthy
the
little
frown
vanished
from
frank
brow
and
he
chuckled
that
is
almost
an
epigram
he
said
what
did
you
tell
uncle
i
told
him
that
i
did
not
think
that
his
suggestion
was
possible
and
that
i
did
not
care
for
cole
nor
he
for
me
you
see
frank
i
owe
your
uncle
john
so
much
i
am
the
daughter
of
one
of
his
best
friends
and
since
dear
daddy
died
uncle
john
has
looked
after
me
he
has
given
me
my
education
my
income
my
everything
he
has
been
a
second
father
to
me
frank
nodded
i
recognize
all
the
difficulties
he
said
and
here
we
are
at
victoria
she
stood
on
the
platform
and
watched
the
train
pull
out
and
waved
her
hand
in
farewell
and
then
returned
to
the
pretty
flat
in
which
john
minute
had
installed
her
as
she
said
her
life
had
been
made
very
smooth
for
her
there
was
no
need
for
her
to
worry
about
money
and
she
was
able
to
devote
her
days
to
the
work
she
loved
best
the
east
end
provident
society
of
which
she
was
president
was
wholly
financed
by
the
rhodesian
millionaire
may
had
a
natural
aptitude
for
charity
work
she
was
an
indefatigable
worker
and
there
was
no
better
known
figure
in
the
poor
streets
adjoining
the
west
indian
docks
than
sister
nuttall
frank
was
interested
in
the
work
without
being
enthusiastic
he
had
all
the
apprehension
of
infectious
disease
and
of
the
inadvisability
of
a
beautiful
girl
slumming
without
attendance
but
the
one
visit
he
had
made
to
the
east
end
in
her
company
had
convinced
him
that
there
was
no
fear
as
to
her
personal
safety
he
was
wont
to
grumble
that
she
was
more
interested
in
her
work
than
she
was
in
him
which
was
probably
true
because
her
development
had
been
a
slow
one
and
it
could
not
be
said
that
she
was
greatly
in
love
with
anything
in
the
world
save
her
mission
she
ate
her
frugal
dinner
and
drove
down
to
the
mission
headquarters
off
the
albert
dock
road
three
nights
a
week
were
devoted
by
the
mission
to
visitation
work
many
women
and
girls
living
in
this
area
spend
their
days
at
factories
in
the
neighborhood
and
they
have
only
the
evenings
for
the
treatment
of
ailments
which
in
people
better
circumstanced
would
produce
the
attendance
of
specialists
for
the
night
work
the
nurses
were
accompanied
by
a
volunteer
male
escort
may
nuttall
duties
carried
her
that
evening
to
silvertown
and
to
a
network
of
mean
streets
to
the
east
of
the
railway
her
work
began
at
dusk
and
was
not
ended
until
night
had
fallen
and
the
stars
were
quivering
in
a
hot
sky
the
heat
was
stifling
and
as
she
came
out
of
the
last
foul
dwelling
she
welcomed
as
a
relief
even
the
vitiated
air
of
the
hot
night
she
went
back
into
the
passageway
of
the
house
and
by
the
light
of
a
paraffin
lamp
made
her
last
entry
in
the
little
diary
she
carried
that
makes
eight
we
have
seen
thompson
she
said
to
her
escort
is
there
anybody
else
on
the
list
nobody
else
miss
said
the
young
man
concealing
a
yawn
i
afraid
it
is
not
very
interesting
for
you
thompson
said
the
girl
sympathetically
you
have
even
the
excitement
of
work
it
must
be
awfully
dull
standing
outside
waiting
for
me
bless
you
miss
said
the
man
i
do
mind
at
all
if
it
is
good
enough
for
you
to
come
into
these
streets
it
is
good
enough
for
me
to
go
round
with
you
they
stood
in
a
little
courtyard
a
cut
off
at
one
end
by
a
sheer
wall
and
as
the
girl
put
back
her
diary
into
her
little
net
bag
a
man
came
swiftly
down
from
the
street
entrance
of
the
court
and
passed
her
as
he
did
so
the
dim
light
of
the
lamp
showed
for
a
second
his
face
and
her
mouth
formed
an
o
of
astonishment
she
watched
him
until
he
disappeared
into
one
of
the
dark
doorways
at
the
farther
end
of
the
court
and
stood
staring
at
the
door
as
though
unable
to
believe
her
eyes
there
was
no
mistaking
the
pale
face
and
the
straight
figure
of
jasper
cole
john
minute
secretary
chapter
iv
the
accountant
at
the
bank
may
nuttall
expressed
her
perplexity
in
a
letter
dear
frank
such
a
remarkable
thing
happened
last
night
i
was
in
silvers
rents
about
eleven
and
had
just
finished
seeing
the
last
of
my
patients
when
a
man
passed
me
and
entered
one
of
the
houses
it
was
i
thought
at
the
time
either
the
last
or
the
last
but
one
on
the
left
i
now
know
that
it
was
the
last
but
one
there
is
no
doubt
at
all
in
my
mind
that
it
was
cole
for
not
only
did
i
see
his
face
but
he
carried
the
snakewood
cane
which
he
always
affects
i
must
confess
i
was
curious
enough
to
make
inquiries
and
i
found
that
he
is
a
frequent
visitor
here
but
nobody
quite
knows
why
he
comes
the
last
house
is
occupied
by
two
families
very
uninteresting
people
and
the
last
house
but
one
is
empty
save
for
a
room
which
is
apparently
the
one
cole
uses
none
of
the
people
in
the
rents
know
cole
or
have
ever
seen
him
apparently
the
downstairs
room
in
the
empty
house
is
kept
locked
and
a
woman
who
lives
opposite
told
my
informant
thompson
whom
you
will
remember
as
the
man
who
always
goes
with
me
when
i
am
slumming
that
the
gentleman
sometimes
comes
uses
this
room
and
that
he
always
sweeps
it
out
for
himself
it
can
not
be
very
well
furnished
and
apparently
he
never
stays
the
night
there
is
it
very
extraordinary
please
tell
me
what
you
make
of
it
frank
merrill
put
down
the
letter
and
slowly
filled
his
pipe
he
was
puzzled
and
found
no
solution
either
then
or
on
his
way
to
the
office
he
was
the
accountant
of
the
piccadilly
branch
of
the
london
and
western
counties
bank
and
had
very
little
time
to
give
to
outside
problems
but
the
thought
of
cole
and
his
curious
appearance
in
a
london
slum
under
circumstances
which
to
say
the
least
were
mysterious
came
between
him
and
his
work
more
than
once
he
was
entering
up
some
transactions
when
he
was
sent
for
by
the
manager
frank
merrill
though
he
did
not
occupy
a
particularly
imposing
post
in
the
bank
held
nevertheless
a
very
extraordinary
position
and
one
which
insured
for
him
more
consideration
than
the
average
official
receives
at
the
hands
of
his
superiors
his
uncle
was
financially
interested
in
the
bank
and
it
was
generally
believed
that
frank
had
been
sent
as
much
to
watch
his
relative
interests
as
to
prepare
himself
for
the
handling
of
the
great
fortune
which
john
minute
would
some
day
leave
to
his
heir
the
manager
nodded
cheerily
as
frank
came
in
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
good
morning
merrill
said
the
chief
i
want
to
see
you
about
holland
account
you
told
me
he
was
in
the
other
day
frank
nodded
he
came
in
in
the
lunch
hour
i
wish
i
had
been
here
said
the
manager
thoughtfully
i
would
like
to
see
this
gentleman
is
there
anything
wrong
with
his
account
oh
no
said
the
manager
with
a
smile
he
has
a
very
good
balance
in
fact
too
large
a
balance
for
a
floating
account
i
wish
you
would
see
him
and
persuade
him
to
put
some
of
this
money
on
deposit
the
head
office
does
not
like
big
floating
balances
which
may
be
withdrawn
at
any
moment
and
which
necessitates
the
keeping
here
of
a
larger
quantity
of
cash
than
i
care
to
hold
personally
he
went
on
i
do
not
like
our
method
of
doing
business
at
all
our
head
office
being
in
plymouth
it
is
necessary
by
the
peculiar
rules
of
the
bank
that
the
floating
balances
should
be
so
covered
and
i
confess
that
your
uncle
is
as
great
a
sinner
as
any
look
at
this
he
pushed
a
check
across
the
table
here
a
bearer
check
for
sixty
thousand
pounds
which
has
just
come
in
it
is
to
pay
the
remainder
of
the
purchase
price
due
to
consolidated
mines
why
they
can
not
accept
the
ordinary
crossed
check
heavens
knows
frank
looked
at
the
sprawling
signature
and
smiled
you
see
uncle
got
a
reputation
to
keep
up
he
said
one
is
not
called
minute
for
nothing
the
manager
made
a
little
grimace
that
sort
of
thing
may
be
necessary
in
south
africa
he
said
but
here
in
the
very
heart
of
the
money
world
cash
payments
are
a
form
of
lunacy
i
do
not
want
you
to
repeat
this
to
your
relative
i
am
hardly
likely
to
do
that
said
frank
though
i
do
think
you
ought
to
allow
something
for
uncle
peculiar
experiences
in
the
early
days
of
his
career
oh
i
make
every
allowance
said
the
other
only
it
is
very
inconvenient
but
it
was
not
to
discuss
your
uncle
shortcomings
that
i
brought
you
here
he
pulled
out
a
pass
book
from
a
heap
in
front
of
him
rex
holland
he
read
he
opened
his
account
while
i
was
on
my
holiday
you
remember
i
remember
very
well
said
frank
and
he
opened
it
through
me
what
sort
of
man
is
he
asked
the
manager
i
am
afraid
i
am
no
good
at
descriptions
replied
frank
but
i
should
describe
him
as
a
typical
young
man
about
town
not
very
brainy
very
few
ideas
outside
of
his
own
immediate
world
which
begins
at
hyde
park
corner
and
ends
at
the
hippodrome
interrupted
the
manager
possibly
said
frank
he
seemed
a
very
sound
capable
man
in
spite
of
a
certain
languid
assumption
of
ignorance
as
to
financial
matters
and
he
came
very
well
recommended
what
would
you
like
me
to
do
the
manager
pushed
himself
back
in
his
chair
thrust
his
hands
in
his
trousers
pockets
and
looked
at
the
ceiling
for
inspiration
suppose
you
go
along
and
see
him
this
afternoon
and
ask
him
as
a
favor
to
put
some
of
his
money
on
deposit
we
will
pay
the
usual
interest
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
you
can
explain
that
he
can
get
the
money
back
whenever
he
wants
it
by
giving
us
thirty
days
notice
will
you
do
this
for
me
surely
said
frank
heartily
i
will
see
him
this
afternoon
what
is
his
address
i
have
forgotten
albemarle
chambers
knightsbridge
replied
the
manager
he
may
be
in
town
and
what
is
his
balance
asked
frank
thousand
pounds
said
the
other
and
as
he
is
not
buying
consolidated
mines
i
do
not
see
what
need
he
has
for
the
money
the
more
so
since
we
can
always
give
him
an
overdraft
on
the
security
of
his
deposit
suggest
to
him
that
he
puts
thirty
thousand
pounds
with
us
and
leaves
seven
thousand
pounds
floating
by
the
way
your
uncle
is
sending
his
secretary
here
this
afternoon
to
go
into
the
question
of
his
own
account
frank
looked
up
cole
he
said
quickly
is
he
coming
here
by
jove
he
stood
by
the
manager
desk
and
a
look
of
amusement
came
into
his
eyes
i
want
to
ask
cole
something
he
said
slowly
what
time
do
you
expect
him
about
four
after
the
bank
closes
the
manager
nodded
uncle
has
a
weird
way
of
doing
business
said
frank
after
a
pause
i
suppose
that
means
that
i
shall
have
to
stay
on
it
is
necessary
said
brandon
you
see
cole
is
one
of
our
directors
frank
checked
an
exclamation
of
surprise
how
long
has
this
been
he
asked
since
last
monday
i
thought
i
told
you
at
any
rate
if
you
have
not
been
told
by
your
uncle
you
had
better
pretend
to
know
nothing
about
it
said
brandon
hastily
you
may
be
sure
i
shall
keep
my
counsel
said
frank
a
little
amused
by
the
other
anxiety
you
have
been
very
good
to
me
brandon
and
i
appreciate
your
kindness
cole
is
a
nominee
of
your
uncle
of
course
brandon
went
on
with
a
little
nod
of
acknowledgment
for
the
other
thanks
your
uncle
makes
a
point
of
never
sitting
on
boards
if
he
can
help
it
and
has
never
been
represented
except
by
his
solicitor
since
he
acquired
so
large
an
interest
in
the
bank
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
cole
is
coming
here
as
much
to
examine
the
affairs
of
the
branch
as
to
look
after
your
uncle
account
cole
is
a
very
man
of
business
is
he
frank
answer
was
a
grim
smile
excellent
he
said
dryly
he
has
the
scientific
mind
grafted
to
a
singular
business
capacity
you
do
like
him
i
have
no
particular
reason
for
not
liking
him
said
the
other
possibly
i
am
being
constitutionally
uncharitable
he
is
not
the
type
of
man
i
greatly
care
for
he
possesses
all
the
virtues
according
to
uncle
spends
his
days
and
nights
almost
slavishly
working
for
his
employer
oh
yes
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
that
is
a
very
fine
quality
in
a
young
man
and
honestly
i
agree
with
you
only
it
seem
natural
i
do
suppose
anybody
works
as
hard
as
i
or
takes
as
much
interest
in
his
work
yet
i
have
no
particular
anxiety
to
carry
it
on
after
business
hours
the
manager
rose
you
are
not
even
an
idle
apprentice
he
said
you
will
see
rex
holland
for
me
certainly
said
frank
and
went
back
to
his
desk
deep
in
thought
it
was
four
to
the
minute
when
jasper
cole
passed
through
the
one
open
door
of
the
bank
at
which
the
porter
stood
ready
to
close
he
was
well
but
neatly
dressed
and
had
hooked
to
his
wrist
a
thin
snakewood
cane
attached
to
a
crook
handle
he
saw
frank
across
the
counter
and
smiled
displaying
two
rows
of
even
white
teeth
hello
jasper
said
frank
easily
extending
his
hand
how
is
uncle
he
is
very
well
indeed
replied
the
other
of
course
he
is
very
worried
about
things
but
then
i
think
he
is
always
worried
about
something
or
other
anything
in
particular
asked
frank
interestedly
jasper
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
know
him
much
better
than
i
you
were
with
him
longer
he
is
getting
so
horribly
suspicious
of
people
and
sees
a
spy
or
an
enemy
in
every
strange
face
that
is
usually
a
bad
sign
but
i
think
he
has
been
a
little
overwrought
lately
he
spoke
easily
his
voice
was
low
and
modulated
with
the
faintest
suggestion
of
a
drawl
which
was
especially
irritating
to
frank
who
secretly
despised
the
oxford
product
though
he
admitted
since
he
was
a
very
and
on
the
whole
young
man
his
dislike
was
unreasonable
i
hear
you
have
come
to
audit
the
accounts
said
frank
leaning
on
the
counter
and
opening
his
gold
cigarette
case
hardly
that
drawled
jasper
he
reached
out
his
hand
and
selected
a
cigarette
i
just
want
to
sort
out
a
few
things
by
the
way
your
uncle
had
a
letter
from
a
friend
of
yours
mine
a
rex
holland
said
the
other
he
is
hardly
a
friend
of
mine
in
fact
he
is
rather
an
infernal
nuisance
said
frank
i
went
down
to
knightsbridge
to
see
him
and
he
was
out
what
has
holland
to
say
oh
he
is
interested
in
some
sort
of
charity
and
he
is
starting
a
guinea
collection
i
forget
what
the
charity
was
why
do
you
call
him
a
friend
of
mine
asked
frank
eying
the
other
keenly
jasper
cole
was
halfway
to
the
manager
office
and
turned
a
little
joke
he
said
i
had
heard
you
mention
the
gentleman
i
have
no
other
reason
for
supposing
he
was
a
friend
of
yours
oh
by
the
way
cole
said
frank
suddenly
were
you
in
town
last
night
jasper
cole
shot
a
swift
glance
at
him
why
were
you
near
victoria
docks
what
a
question
to
ask
said
the
other
with
his
inscrutable
smile
and
turning
abruptly
walked
in
to
the
waiting
brandon
frank
finished
work
at
that
night
and
left
jasper
cole
and
a
junior
clerk
to
the
congenial
task
of
checking
the
securities
at
nine
the
clerk
went
home
leaving
jasper
alone
in
the
bank
brandon
the
manager
was
a
bachelor
and
occupied
a
flat
above
the
bank
premises
from
time
to
time
he
strode
in
his
big
pipe
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
the
last
of
these
occasions
was
when
jasper
cole
had
replaced
the
last
ledger
in
mr
minute
private
safe
half
past
eleven
said
the
manager
disapprovingly
and
you
have
had
no
dinner
i
can
afford
to
miss
a
dinner
laughed
the
other
lucky
man
said
the
manager
jasper
cole
passed
out
into
the
street
and
called
a
passing
taxi
to
the
curb
charing
cross
station
he
said
he
dismissed
the
cab
in
the
station
courtyard
and
after
a
while
walked
back
to
the
strand
and
hailed
another
victoria
dock
road
he
said
in
a
low
voice
chapter
v
john
minute
legacy
la
rochefoucauld
has
said
that
prudence
and
love
are
inconsistent
may
nuttall
who
had
never
explored
the
philosophies
of
la
rochefoucauld
had
nevertheless
seen
that
quotation
in
the
birthday
book
of
an
acquaintance
and
the
saying
had
made
a
great
impression
upon
her
she
was
years
of
age
at
which
age
girls
are
most
impressionable
and
are
little
influenced
by
the
workings
of
pure
reason
they
are
prepared
to
take
their
philosophies
and
not
disinclined
to
accept
from
others
certain
rigid
standards
by
which
they
measure
their
own
elastic
temperaments
frank
merrill
was
at
once
a
comfort
and
the
cause
of
a
certain
resentment
since
she
was
of
the
age
which
resents
dependence
the
woman
who
spends
any
appreciable
time
in
the
discussion
with
herself
as
to
whether
she
does
or
does
not
love
a
man
can
only
have
her
doubts
set
at
rest
by
the
discovery
of
somebody
whom
she
loves
better
she
liked
frank
and
liked
him
well
enough
to
accept
the
little
ring
which
marked
the
beginning
of
a
new
relationship
which
was
not
exactly
an
engagement
yet
brought
to
her
friendship
a
glamour
which
it
had
never
before
possessed
she
liked
him
well
enough
to
want
his
love
she
loved
him
little
enough
to
find
the
prospect
of
an
early
marriage
alarming
that
she
did
not
understand
herself
was
not
remarkable
has
not
the
experience
by
which
the
complexities
of
may
be
straightened
out
and
made
visible
she
sat
at
breakfast
puzzling
the
matter
out
and
was
a
little
disturbed
and
even
distressed
to
find
in
contrasting
the
men
that
of
the
two
she
had
a
warmer
and
a
deeper
feeling
for
jasper
cole
her
alarm
was
due
to
the
recollection
of
one
of
frank
warnings
almost
prophetic
it
seemed
to
her
now
that
man
has
a
fascination
which
i
would
be
the
last
to
deny
i
find
myself
liking
him
though
my
instinct
tells
me
he
is
the
worst
enemy
i
have
in
the
world
if
her
attitude
toward
frank
was
difficult
to
define
more
remarkable
was
her
attitude
of
mind
toward
jasper
cole
there
was
something
sinister
no
that
was
not
the
word
something
frightening
about
him
he
had
a
magnetism
an
aura
of
personal
power
which
seemed
to
paralyze
the
will
of
any
who
came
into
conflict
with
him
she
remembered
how
often
she
had
gone
to
the
big
library
at
weald
lodge
with
the
firm
intention
of
having
it
out
with
jasper
sometimes
it
was
a
question
of
domestic
economy
into
which
he
had
obtruded
his
views
when
she
was
sixteen
she
was
practically
housekeeper
to
her
adopted
uncle
perhaps
it
was
a
matter
of
carriage
arrangement
once
it
had
been
much
more
serious
for
after
she
had
fixed
up
to
go
with
a
merry
picnic
party
to
the
downs
jasper
in
her
uncle
absence
and
on
his
authority
had
firmly
but
gently
forbidden
her
attendance
was
it
an
accident
that
frank
merrill
was
one
of
the
party
and
that
he
was
coming
down
from
london
for
an
afternoon
fun
in
this
case
as
in
every
other
jasper
had
his
way
he
even
convinced
her
that
his
view
was
right
and
hers
was
wrong
he
had
on
this
occasion
all
suggestion
that
it
was
the
presence
of
frank
merrill
which
had
induced
him
to
exercise
the
veto
which
his
extraordinary
position
gave
to
him
according
to
his
version
it
had
been
the
inclusion
in
the
party
of
two
ladies
whose
names
were
famous
in
the
theatrical
world
which
had
raised
his
delicate
gorge
may
thought
of
this
particular
incident
as
she
sat
at
breakfast
and
with
a
feeling
of
exasperation
she
realized
that
whenever
jasper
had
set
his
foot
down
he
had
never
been
short
of
a
plausible
reason
for
opposing
her
for
one
thing
however
she
gave
him
credit
never
once
had
he
spoken
depreciatingly
of
frank
she
wondered
what
business
brought
jasper
to
such
an
unsavory
neighborhood
as
that
in
which
she
had
seen
him
she
had
all
a
curiosity
without
a
woman
suspicions
and
strangely
enough
she
did
not
associate
his
presence
in
this
terrible
neighborhood
or
his
mysterious
comings
and
goings
with
anything
discreditable
to
himself
she
thought
it
was
a
little
eccentric
in
him
and
wondered
whether
he
too
was
running
a
little
mission
of
his
own
but
dismissed
that
idea
since
she
had
received
no
confirmation
of
the
theory
from
the
people
with
whom
she
came
into
contact
in
that
neighborhood
she
was
halfway
through
her
breakfast
when
the
telephone
bell
rang
and
she
rose
from
the
table
and
crossed
to
the
wall
at
the
first
word
from
the
caller
she
recognized
him
why
uncle
she
said
whatever
are
you
doing
in
town
the
voice
of
john
minute
bellowed
through
the
receiver
i
an
important
engagement
will
you
lunch
with
me
at
at
the
savoy
he
scarcely
waited
for
her
to
accept
the
invitation
before
he
hung
up
his
receiver
the
commissioner
of
police
replaced
the
book
which
he
had
taken
from
the
shelf
at
the
side
of
his
desk
swung
round
in
his
chair
and
smiled
quizzically
at
the
perturbed
and
irascible
visitor
the
man
who
sat
at
the
other
side
of
the
desk
might
have
been
he
was
of
middle
height
and
was
dressed
in
a
somewhat
violent
check
suit
the
fit
of
which
advertised
the
skill
of
the
great
tailor
who
had
ably
fashioned
so
fine
a
creation
from
so
unlovely
a
pattern
he
wore
a
low
collar
which
would
have
displayed
a
massive
neck
but
for
the
fact
that
a
glaring
purple
cravat
and
a
diamond
as
big
as
a
hazelnut
directed
the
observer
attention
elsewhere
the
face
was
an
unusual
one
strong
to
a
point
of
coarseness
the
bulbous
nose
the
thick
irregular
lips
the
massive
chin
all
spoke
of
the
hard
life
which
john
minute
had
spent
his
eyes
were
blue
and
cold
his
hair
a
thick
and
unruly
mop
of
gray
at
a
distance
he
conveyed
a
curious
illusion
of
refinement
nearer
at
hand
his
pink
face
repelled
one
by
its
crudities
he
reminded
the
commissioner
of
a
piece
of
scene
painting
that
pleased
from
the
gallery
and
disappointed
from
the
boxes
you
see
mr
minute
said
sir
george
suavely
we
are
rather
limited
in
our
opportunities
and
in
our
powers
personally
i
should
be
most
happy
to
help
you
not
only
because
it
is
my
business
to
help
everybody
but
because
you
were
so
kind
to
my
boy
in
south
africa
the
letters
of
introduction
you
gave
to
him
were
most
helpful
the
commissioner
son
had
been
on
a
hunting
trip
through
rhodesia
and
barotseland
and
a
chance
meeting
at
a
dinner
party
with
the
rhodesian
millionaire
had
produced
these
letters
but
continued
the
official
with
a
little
gesture
of
despair
scotland
yard
has
its
limitations
we
can
not
investigate
the
cause
of
intangible
fears
if
you
are
threatened
we
can
help
you
but
the
mere
fact
that
you
fancy
there
is
come
sort
of
vague
danger
would
not
justify
our
taking
any
action
john
minute
hitched
about
in
his
chair
what
are
the
police
for
he
asked
impatiently
i
have
enemies
sir
george
i
took
a
quiet
little
place
in
the
country
just
outside
eastbourne
to
get
away
from
london
and
all
sorts
of
new
people
are
prying
round
us
there
was
a
new
parson
called
the
other
day
for
a
subscription
to
some
boy
scouts
movement
or
other
he
has
been
hanging
round
my
place
for
a
month
and
lives
at
a
cottage
near
polegate
why
should
he
have
come
to
eastbourne
on
a
holiday
trip
suggested
the
commissioner
bah
said
john
minute
contemptuously
there
some
other
reason
i
had
him
watched
he
goes
every
day
to
visit
a
woman
at
a
hotel
a
confederate
they
never
seen
in
public
together
then
there
a
peddler
one
of
those
fellows
who
sell
glass
and
repair
windows
nobody
knows
anything
about
him
he
does
do
enough
business
to
keep
a
fly
alive
he
always
hanging
round
weald
lodge
then
there
a
miss
paines
who
says
she
a
landscape
gardener
and
wants
to
lay
out
the
grounds
in
some
newfangled
way
i
sent
her
packing
about
her
business
but
she
has
left
the
neighborhood
have
you
reported
the
matter
to
the
local
police
asked
the
commissioner
minute
nodded
and
they
know
nothing
suspicious
about
them
nothing
said
mr
minute
briefly
then
said
the
other
smiling
there
is
probably
nothing
known
against
them
and
they
are
quite
innocent
people
trying
to
get
a
living
after
all
mr
minute
a
man
who
is
as
rich
as
you
are
must
expect
to
attract
a
number
of
people
each
trying
to
secure
some
of
your
wealth
in
a
more
or
less
legitimate
way
i
suspect
nothing
more
remarkable
than
this
has
happened
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
his
hands
clasped
a
sudden
frown
on
his
face
i
hate
to
suggest
that
anybody
knows
any
more
than
we
but
as
you
are
so
worried
i
will
put
you
in
touch
with
a
man
who
will
probably
relieve
your
anxiety
minute
looked
up
a
police
officer
he
asked
sir
george
shook
his
head
no
this
is
a
private
detective
he
can
do
things
for
you
which
we
can
not
have
you
ever
heard
of
saul
arthur
mann
i
see
you
have
saul
arthur
mann
said
the
commissioner
has
been
a
good
friend
of
ours
and
possibly
in
recommending
him
to
you
i
may
be
a
good
friend
to
both
of
you
he
is
man
who
knows
man
who
knows
repeated
mr
minute
dubiously
what
does
he
know
i
show
you
said
the
commissioner
he
went
to
the
telephone
gave
a
number
and
while
he
was
waiting
for
the
call
to
be
put
through
he
asked
what
is
the
name
of
your
parson
the
reverend
vincent
lock
replied
mr
minute
i
suppose
you
do
know
the
name
of
your
glass
peddler
minute
shook
his
head
they
call
him
in
the
village
he
said
and
the
lady
name
is
miss
paines
i
think
asked
the
commissioner
jotting
down
the
names
as
he
repeated
them
well
we
shall
hello
is
that
saul
arthur
mann
this
is
sir
george
fuller
connect
me
with
mann
will
you
he
waited
a
second
and
then
continued
is
that
you
mann
i
want
to
ask
you
something
will
you
note
these
three
names
the
reverend
vincent
lock
a
peddling
glazier
who
is
known
as
and
a
miss
paines
have
you
got
them
i
wish
you
would
let
me
know
something
about
them
mr
minute
rose
perhaps
you
let
me
know
sir
george
he
began
holding
out
his
hand
do
go
yet
replied
the
commissioner
waving
him
to
his
chair
again
you
will
obtain
all
the
information
you
want
in
a
few
minutes
but
surely
he
must
make
inquiries
said
the
other
surprised
sir
george
shook
his
head
the
curious
thing
about
saul
arthur
mann
is
that
he
never
has
to
make
inquiries
that
is
why
he
is
called
man
who
knows
he
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
people
in
the
world
of
criminal
investigation
he
went
on
we
tried
to
induce
him
to
come
to
scotland
yard
i
am
not
so
sure
that
the
government
would
have
paid
him
his
price
at
any
rate
he
saved
me
any
embarrassment
by
refusing
the
telephone
bell
rang
at
that
moment
and
sir
george
lifted
the
receiver
he
took
a
pencil
and
wrote
rapidly
on
his
pad
and
when
he
had
finished
he
said
thank
you
and
hung
up
the
receiver
here
is
your
information
mr
minute
he
said
the
reverend
vincent
lock
curate
in
a
very
poor
neighborhood
near
manchester
interested
in
the
boy
scouts
movement
his
brother
george
henry
locke
has
had
some
domestic
trouble
his
wife
running
away
from
him
she
is
now
staying
at
the
grand
hotel
eastbourne
and
is
visited
every
day
by
her
who
is
endeavoring
to
induce
her
to
return
to
her
home
that
disposes
of
the
reverend
gentleman
and
his
confederate
miss
paines
is
a
genuine
landscape
gardener
has
been
the
plaintiff
in
two
cases
one
of
which
came
to
the
court
there
is
no
doubt
the
commissioner
went
on
reading
the
paper
that
her
is
to
get
elderly
gentlemen
to
propose
marriage
and
then
to
commence
her
action
that
disposes
of
miss
paines
and
you
now
know
why
she
is
worrying
you
our
friend
has
another
name
thomas
cobbler
and
he
has
been
three
times
convicted
of
larceny
the
commissioner
looked
up
with
a
grim
little
smile
i
shall
have
something
to
say
to
our
own
record
department
for
failing
to
trace
he
said
and
then
resumed
his
reading
and
that
is
everything
it
disposes
of
our
three
he
said
i
will
see
that
does
not
annoy
you
any
more
but
how
the
dickens
began
mr
minute
how
the
dickens
does
this
fellow
find
out
in
so
short
a
time
the
commissioner
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
just
knows
he
said
he
took
leave
of
his
visitor
at
the
door
if
you
are
bothered
any
more
he
said
i
should
strongly
advise
you
to
go
to
saul
arthur
mann
i
do
know
what
your
real
trouble
is
and
you
have
told
me
exactly
why
you
should
fear
an
attack
of
any
kind
you
wo
have
to
tell
mann
he
said
with
a
little
twinkle
in
his
eye
why
not
asked
the
other
suspiciously
because
he
will
know
said
the
commissioner
the
devil
he
will
growled
john
minute
and
stumped
down
the
broad
stairs
on
to
the
embankment
a
greatly
mystified
man
he
would
have
gone
off
to
seek
an
interview
with
this
strange
individual
there
and
then
for
his
curiosity
was
piqued
and
he
had
also
a
little
apprehension
one
which
in
his
impatient
way
he
desired
should
be
allayed
but
he
remembered
that
he
had
asked
may
to
lunch
with
him
and
he
was
already
five
minutes
late
he
found
the
girl
in
the
broad
vestibule
waiting
for
him
and
greeted
her
affectionately
whatever
may
be
said
of
john
minute
that
is
not
wholly
to
his
credit
it
can
not
be
said
that
he
lacked
sincerity
there
are
people
in
rhodesia
who
speak
of
him
without
love
they
describe
him
as
the
greatest
land
thief
that
ever
rode
a
zeedersburg
coach
from
port
charter
to
salisbury
to
register
land
that
he
had
obtained
by
trickery
they
tell
stories
of
those
wonderful
coach
drives
of
his
with
relays
of
twelve
mules
waiting
every
ten
miles
they
speak
of
his
gambling
propensities
of
farms
that
changed
hands
at
the
turn
of
a
card
and
there
are
stories
that
are
less
printable
when
a
little
mashona
chief
found
gold
in
and
refused
to
locate
the
reef
it
was
john
minute
who
staked
him
out
and
lit
a
grass
fire
on
his
chest
until
he
spoke
many
of
the
stories
are
probably
exaggerated
but
all
rhodesia
agrees
that
john
minute
robbed
impartially
friend
and
foe
the
confidant
of
and
the
company
alike
he
betrayed
both
and
on
that
terrible
day
when
it
was
a
toss
of
a
coin
whether
the
concession
seekers
would
be
butchered
in
kraal
john
minute
escaped
with
the
only
available
span
of
mules
and
left
his
comrades
to
their
fate
yet
he
had
big
generous
traits
and
could
on
occasions
be
a
tender
and
a
kindly
friend
he
had
married
when
a
young
man
and
had
taken
his
wife
into
the
wilds
there
was
a
story
that
she
had
met
a
handsome
young
trader
and
had
eloped
with
him
that
john
minute
had
chased
them
over
three
hundred
miles
of
hostile
country
from
victoria
falls
to
charter
from
charter
to
marandalas
from
marandalas
to
massikassi
and
had
arrived
in
biera
so
close
upon
their
trail
that
he
had
seen
the
ship
which
carried
them
to
the
cape
steaming
down
the
river
he
had
never
married
again
report
said
that
the
woman
had
died
of
malaria
a
more
popular
version
of
the
story
was
that
john
minute
had
relentlessly
followed
his
erring
wife
to
pieter
maritzburg
and
had
shot
her
and
had
thereupon
served
seven
years
on
the
breakwater
for
his
sin
about
a
man
who
is
rich
powerful
and
wholly
unpopular
hated
by
the
majority
and
feared
by
all
legends
grow
as
quickly
as
toadstools
on
a
marshy
moor
some
were
half
true
some
wholly
apocryphal
deliberate
and
malicious
inventions
true
or
false
john
minute
ignored
them
all
denying
nothing
explaining
nothing
and
even
refusing
to
take
action
against
a
cape
town
weekly
which
dealt
with
his
career
in
a
spirit
of
unpardonable
frankness
there
was
only
one
person
in
the
world
whom
he
loved
more
than
the
girl
whose
hand
he
held
as
they
went
down
to
the
cheeriest
restaurant
in
london
i
have
had
a
queer
interview
he
said
in
his
gruff
quick
way
i
have
been
to
see
the
police
oh
uncle
she
said
reproachfully
he
jerked
his
shoulder
impatiently
my
dear
you
do
know
he
said
i
have
got
all
sorts
of
people
who
he
stopped
short
what
was
there
remarkable
in
the
interview
she
asked
after
he
had
ordered
the
lunch
have
you
ever
heard
he
asked
of
saul
arthur
mann
saul
arthur
mann
she
repeated
i
seem
to
know
that
name
mann
mann
where
have
i
heard
it
well
said
he
with
that
fierce
and
fleeting
little
smile
which
rarely
lit
his
face
for
a
second
if
you
do
know
him
he
knows
you
he
knows
everybody
oh
i
remember
he
is
man
who
knows
it
was
his
turn
to
be
astonished
where
in
the
world
have
you
heard
of
him
briefly
she
retailed
her
experience
and
when
she
came
to
describe
the
omniscient
mann
a
crank
growled
mr
minute
i
was
hoping
there
was
something
in
it
surely
uncle
there
must
be
something
in
it
said
the
girl
seriously
a
man
of
the
standing
of
the
chief
commissioner
would
not
speak
about
him
as
sir
george
did
unless
he
had
very
excellent
reason
tell
me
some
more
about
what
you
saw
he
said
i
seem
to
remember
the
report
of
the
inquest
the
dead
man
was
unknown
and
has
not
been
identified
she
described
as
well
as
she
could
remember
her
meeting
with
the
knowledgable
mann
she
had
to
be
tactful
because
she
wished
to
tell
the
story
without
betraying
the
fact
that
she
had
been
with
frank
but
she
might
have
saved
herself
the
trouble
because
when
she
was
halfway
through
the
narrative
he
interrupted
her
i
gather
you
were
not
by
yourself
he
grumbled
master
frank
was
somewhere
handy
i
suppose
she
laughed
i
met
him
quite
by
accident
she
said
demurely
naturally
said
john
minute
oh
uncle
and
there
was
a
man
whom
frank
knew
you
probably
know
him
constable
wiseman
john
minute
unfolded
his
napkin
stirred
his
soup
and
grunted
wiseman
is
a
stupid
ass
he
said
briefly
the
mere
fact
that
he
was
mixed
up
in
the
affair
is
sufficient
explanation
as
to
why
the
dead
man
remains
unknown
i
know
constable
wiseman
very
well
he
said
he
has
summoned
me
twice
once
for
doing
a
little
in
the
garden
just
as
an
object
lesson
to
all
tramps
and
once
confound
him
for
a
smoking
chimney
oh
yes
i
know
constable
wiseman
apparently
the
thought
of
constable
wiseman
filled
his
mind
through
two
courses
for
he
did
not
speak
until
he
set
his
fish
knife
and
fork
together
and
muttered
something
about
a
silly
meddling
jackass
he
was
very
silent
throughout
the
meal
his
mind
being
divided
between
two
subjects
uppermost
though
of
least
importance
was
the
personality
of
saul
arthur
mann
him
he
mentally
viewed
with
suspicion
and
apprehension
it
was
an
irritation
even
to
suggest
that
there
might
be
secret
places
in
his
own
life
which
could
be
flooded
with
the
light
of
this
man
knowledge
and
he
resolved
to
beard
the
man
who
knows
in
his
den
that
afternoon
and
challenge
him
by
inference
to
produce
all
the
information
he
had
concerning
his
past
there
was
much
which
was
public
property
it
was
john
minute
boast
that
his
life
was
a
book
which
might
be
read
but
in
his
inmost
heart
he
knew
of
one
dark
place
which
baffled
the
outside
world
he
brought
himself
from
the
mental
rehearsal
of
his
interview
to
what
was
after
all
the
first
and
more
important
business
may
he
said
suddenly
have
you
thought
any
more
about
what
i
asked
you
she
made
no
attempt
to
fence
with
the
question
you
mean
jasper
cole
he
nodded
and
for
the
moment
she
made
no
reply
and
sat
with
eyes
downcast
tracing
a
little
figure
upon
the
tablecloth
with
her
finger
tip
the
truth
is
uncle
she
said
at
last
i
am
not
keen
on
marriage
at
all
just
yet
and
you
are
sufficiently
acquainted
with
human
nature
to
know
that
anything
which
savors
of
coercion
will
not
make
me
predisposed
toward
mr
cole
i
suppose
the
real
truth
is
he
said
gruffly
that
you
are
in
love
with
frank
she
laughed
that
is
just
what
the
real
truth
is
not
she
said
i
like
frank
very
much
he
is
a
dear
bright
sunny
boy
mr
minute
grunted
oh
yes
he
is
the
girl
went
on
but
i
am
not
in
love
with
him
really
i
suppose
you
are
not
influenced
by
the
fact
that
he
is
my
heir
he
said
and
eyed
her
keenly
she
met
his
glance
steadily
if
you
were
not
the
nicest
man
i
know
she
smiled
i
should
be
very
offended
of
course
i
do
care
whether
frank
is
rich
or
poor
you
have
provided
too
well
for
me
for
mercenary
considerations
to
weigh
at
all
with
me
john
minute
grunted
again
i
am
quite
serious
about
jasper
why
are
you
so
keen
on
jasper
she
asked
he
hesitated
i
know
him
he
said
shortly
he
has
proved
to
me
in
a
hundred
ways
that
he
is
a
reliable
decent
lad
he
has
become
almost
indispensable
to
me
he
continued
with
his
quick
little
laugh
and
that
frank
has
never
been
oh
yes
frank
all
right
in
his
way
but
he
crazy
on
things
which
cut
no
ice
with
me
too
fond
of
sports
too
fond
of
loafing
he
growled
the
girl
laughed
again
i
can
give
you
a
little
information
on
one
point
john
minute
went
on
and
it
was
to
tell
you
this
that
i
brought
you
here
i
am
a
very
rich
man
you
know
that
i
have
made
millions
and
lost
them
but
i
have
still
enough
to
satisfy
my
heirs
i
am
leaving
you
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
in
my
will
she
looked
at
him
with
a
startled
exclamation
uncle
she
said
he
nodded
it
is
not
a
quarter
of
my
fortune
he
went
on
quickly
but
it
will
make
you
comfortable
after
i
am
gone
he
rested
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
looked
at
her
searchingly
you
are
an
heiress
he
said
for
whatever
you
did
i
should
never
change
my
mind
oh
i
know
you
will
do
nothing
of
which
i
should
disapprove
but
there
is
the
fact
if
you
marry
frank
you
would
still
get
your
two
hundred
thousand
though
i
should
bitterly
regret
your
marriage
no
my
girl
he
said
more
kindly
than
was
his
wont
i
only
ask
you
this
that
whatever
else
you
do
you
will
not
make
your
choice
until
the
next
fortnight
has
expired
with
a
jerk
of
his
head
john
minute
summoned
a
waiter
and
paid
his
bill
no
more
was
said
until
he
handed
her
into
her
cab
in
the
courtyard
i
shall
be
in
town
next
week
he
said
he
watched
the
cab
disappear
in
the
stream
of
traffic
which
flowed
along
the
strand
and
calling
another
taxi
he
drove
to
the
address
with
which
the
chief
commissioner
had
furnished
him
chapter
vi
the
man
who
knew
backwell
street
in
the
city
of
london
contains
one
palatial
building
which
at
one
time
was
the
headquarters
of
the
south
american
stock
exchange
a
superior
bucket
shop
which
on
its
failure
had
claimed
its
fifty
thousand
victims
the
ornate
gold
lettering
on
its
great
window
had
long
since
been
removed
and
the
big
brass
plate
which
announced
to
the
passerby
that
here
sat
the
spider
weaving
his
golden
web
for
the
multitude
of
flies
had
been
replaced
by
a
modest
oxidized
scroll
bearing
the
simple
legend
saul
arthur
mann
what
mann
business
was
few
people
knew
he
kept
an
army
of
clerks
he
had
the
largest
collection
of
file
cabinets
possessed
by
any
three
business
houses
in
the
city
he
had
an
enormous
post
bag
and
both
he
and
his
clerks
kept
regulation
business
hours
his
beginnings
however
were
well
known
he
had
been
a
stockbroker
clerk
with
a
passion
for
collecting
clippings
mainly
dealing
with
political
geographical
and
meteorological
conditions
obtaining
in
those
areas
wherein
the
great
joint
stock
companies
of
the
earth
were
engaged
in
operations
he
had
gradually
built
up
a
service
of
correspondence
all
over
the
world
the
first
news
of
labor
trouble
on
a
gold
field
came
to
him
and
his
brokers
indicated
his
view
upon
the
situation
in
that
particular
area
by
bearing
the
stock
of
the
affected
company
if
his
liverpool
agents
suddenly
descended
upon
the
cotton
exchange
and
began
buying
may
cotton
in
enormous
quantities
the
initiated
knew
that
saul
arthur
mann
had
been
awakened
from
his
slumbers
by
a
telegram
describing
storm
havoc
in
the
cotton
belt
of
the
united
states
of
america
when
a
curious
blight
fell
upon
the
coffee
plantations
of
ceylon
a
cablegram
describing
the
habits
and
characteristics
of
the
minute
insect
which
caused
the
blight
reached
saul
arthur
mann
at
two
in
the
afternoon
and
by
three
the
price
of
coffee
had
jumped
when
on
another
occasion
señor
almarez
the
president
of
cacura
had
thrown
a
glass
of
wine
in
the
face
of
his
captain
vassalaro
saul
arthur
mann
had
jumped
into
the
market
and
beaten
down
all
cacura
stocks
which
were
fairly
high
as
a
result
of
excellent
crops
and
secure
government
he
beared
them
because
he
knew
that
vassalaro
was
a
dead
shot
and
that
the
inevitable
duel
would
deprive
cacura
of
the
best
president
it
had
had
for
twenty
years
and
that
the
way
would
be
open
for
the
election
of
sebastian
romelez
who
had
behind
him
a
certain
group
of
german
financiers
who
desired
to
exploit
the
country
in
their
own
peculiar
fashion
he
probably
built
up
a
very
considerable
fortune
and
it
is
certain
that
he
extended
the
range
of
his
inquiries
until
the
making
of
money
by
means
of
his
curious
information
bureau
became
only
a
secondary
consideration
he
had
a
marvelous
memory
which
was
supplemented
by
his
system
of
filing
he
would
go
to
work
patiently
for
months
and
spend
sums
of
money
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
value
of
the
information
to
discover
for
example
the
reason
why
a
district
officer
in
some
spot
in
india
had
been
obliged
to
return
to
england
before
his
tour
of
duty
had
ended
his
thirst
for
facts
was
insatiable
his
grasp
of
the
politics
of
every
country
in
the
world
and
his
extraordinarily
accurate
information
concerning
the
personality
of
all
those
who
directed
those
policies
was
the
basis
upon
which
he
was
able
to
build
up
theories
of
amazing
accuracy
a
man
of
simple
tastes
who
lived
in
a
rambling
old
house
in
streatham
his
work
his
hobby
and
his
very
life
was
his
bureau
he
had
assisted
the
police
times
without
number
and
had
been
so
fascinated
by
the
success
of
this
branch
of
his
investigations
that
he
had
started
a
new
criminal
record
which
had
been
of
the
greatest
help
to
the
police
and
had
piqued
scotland
yard
to
emulation
john
minute
descending
from
his
cab
at
the
door
looked
up
at
the
imposing
facia
with
a
frown
entering
the
broad
vestibule
he
handed
his
card
to
the
waiting
attendant
and
took
a
seat
in
a
waiting
room
five
minutes
later
he
was
ushered
into
the
presence
of
the
man
who
knew
mann
a
comical
little
figure
at
a
very
large
writing
table
jumped
up
and
went
halfway
across
the
big
room
to
meet
his
visitor
he
beamed
through
his
big
spectacles
as
he
waved
john
minute
to
a
deep
armchair
the
chief
commissioner
sent
you
did
he
he
said
pointing
an
accusing
finger
at
the
visitor
i
know
he
did
because
he
called
me
up
this
morning
and
asked
me
about
three
people
who
i
happen
to
know
have
been
bothering
you
now
what
can
i
do
for
you
mr
minute
john
minute
stretched
his
legs
and
thrust
his
hands
defiantly
into
his
trousers
pockets
you
can
tell
me
all
you
know
about
me
he
said
saul
arthur
mann
trotted
back
to
his
big
table
and
seated
himself
i
have
time
to
tell
you
as
much
he
said
breezily
but
i
give
you
a
few
outlines
he
pressed
a
bell
at
his
desk
opened
a
big
index
and
ran
his
finger
down
bring
me
he
said
impressively
to
the
clerk
who
made
his
appearance
to
john
minute
surprise
it
was
not
a
bulky
dossier
with
which
the
attendant
returned
but
a
neat
little
book
soberly
bound
in
gray
now
said
mann
wriggling
himself
comfortably
back
in
his
chair
i
will
read
a
few
things
to
you
he
held
up
the
book
there
are
no
names
in
this
book
my
friend
not
a
single
blessed
name
nobody
knows
who
is
except
myself
he
patted
the
big
index
affectionately
the
name
is
there
when
i
leave
this
office
it
will
be
behind
three
depths
of
steel
when
i
die
it
will
be
burned
with
me
he
opened
the
little
book
again
and
read
he
read
steadily
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
a
monotonous
singsong
voice
and
john
minute
slowly
sat
himself
erect
and
listened
with
tense
face
and
narrow
eyelids
to
the
record
he
did
not
interrupt
until
the
other
had
finished
half
of
your
facts
are
lies
he
said
harshly
some
of
them
are
just
common
gossip
some
are
purely
imaginary
saul
arthur
mann
closed
the
book
and
shook
his
head
everything
here
he
said
touching
the
book
is
true
it
may
not
be
the
truth
as
you
want
it
known
but
it
is
the
truth
if
i
thought
there
was
a
single
fact
in
there
which
was
not
true
my
would
be
lost
that
is
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
mr
minute
he
went
on
and
the
little
face
was
pink
with
annoyance
suppose
it
were
the
truth
interrupted
john
minute
what
price
would
you
ask
for
that
record
and
such
documents
as
you
say
you
have
to
prove
its
truth
the
other
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
clasped
his
hands
meditatively
how
much
do
you
think
you
are
worth
mr
minute
you
ought
to
know
said
the
other
with
a
sneer
saul
arthur
mann
inclined
his
head
at
the
present
price
of
securities
i
should
say
about
one
million
two
hundred
and
seventy
thousand
pounds
he
said
and
john
minute
opened
his
eyes
in
astonishment
near
enough
he
reluctantly
admitted
well
the
little
man
continued
if
you
multiply
that
by
fifty
and
you
bring
all
that
money
into
my
office
and
place
it
on
that
table
in
notes
you
could
not
buy
that
little
book
or
the
records
which
support
it
he
jumped
up
i
am
afraid
i
am
keeping
you
mr
minute
you
are
not
keeping
me
said
the
other
roughly
before
i
go
i
want
to
know
what
use
you
are
going
to
make
of
your
knowledge
the
little
man
spread
out
his
hands
in
deprecation
what
use
you
have
seen
the
use
to
which
i
have
put
it
i
have
told
you
what
no
other
living
soul
will
know
how
do
you
know
i
am
john
minute
asked
the
visitor
quickly
some
photographs
of
you
are
included
in
the
folder
which
contains
your
record
mr
minute
said
the
little
investigator
calmly
you
see
you
are
quite
a
prominent
personage
one
of
the
two
hundred
and
four
really
rich
men
in
england
i
am
not
likely
to
mistake
you
for
anybody
else
and
more
than
this
your
history
is
so
interesting
a
one
that
naturally
i
know
much
more
about
you
than
i
should
if
you
had
lived
the
dull
and
placid
life
of
a
city
merchant
tell
me
one
thing
before
i
go
asked
minute
where
is
the
person
you
refer
to
as
saul
arthur
mann
smiled
and
inclined
his
head
never
so
slightly
that
is
a
question
which
you
have
no
right
to
ask
he
said
it
is
information
which
is
available
to
the
police
or
to
any
authorized
person
who
wishes
to
get
into
touch
with
i
might
add
he
went
on
that
there
is
much
more
i
could
tell
you
if
it
were
not
that
it
would
involve
persons
with
whom
you
are
acquainted
john
minute
left
the
bureau
looking
a
little
older
a
little
paler
than
when
he
had
entered
he
drove
to
his
club
with
one
thought
in
his
mind
and
that
thought
revolved
about
the
identity
and
the
whereabouts
of
the
person
referred
to
in
the
little
man
record
as
x
chapter
vii
introducing
rex
holland
rex
holland
stepped
out
of
his
new
car
and
standing
back
a
pace
surveyed
his
recent
acquisition
with
a
dispassionate
eye
i
think
she
will
do
feltham
he
said
the
chauffeur
touched
his
cap
and
grinned
broadly
she
did
it
in
minutes
sir
not
bad
for
a
run
half
of
it
through
london
not
bad
agreed
holland
slowly
stripping
his
gloves
the
car
was
drawn
up
at
the
entrance
to
the
country
cottage
which
a
lavish
expenditure
of
money
had
converted
into
a
bijou
palace
he
still
lingered
and
the
chauffeur
feeling
that
some
encouragement
to
conversation
was
called
for
ventured
the
view
that
a
car
ought
to
be
a
good
one
if
one
spent
eight
hundred
pounds
on
it
everything
that
is
good
costs
money
said
rex
holland
sententiously
and
then
continued
correct
me
if
i
am
mistaken
but
as
we
came
through
putney
did
i
not
see
you
nod
to
the
driver
of
another
car
yes
sir
when
i
engaged
you
holland
went
on
in
his
even
voice
you
told
me
that
you
had
just
arrived
from
australia
and
knew
nobody
in
england
i
think
my
advertisement
made
it
clear
that
i
wanted
a
man
who
fulfilled
these
conditions
quite
right
sir
i
was
as
much
surprised
as
you
the
driver
of
that
car
was
a
fellow
who
traveled
over
to
the
old
country
on
the
same
boat
as
me
it
rather
rum
that
he
should
have
got
the
same
kind
of
job
holland
smiled
quietly
i
hope
his
employer
is
not
as
eccentric
as
i
and
that
he
pays
his
servant
on
my
scale
with
this
shot
he
unlocked
and
passed
through
the
door
of
the
cottage
feltham
drove
his
car
to
the
garage
which
had
been
built
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
once
free
from
observation
lit
his
pipe
and
seating
himself
on
a
box
drew
from
his
pocket
a
little
card
which
he
perused
with
unusual
care
he
read
one
to
act
as
chauffeur
and
valet
two
to
receive
ten
pounds
a
week
and
expenses
three
to
make
no
friends
or
acquaintances
four
never
under
any
circumstances
to
discuss
my
employer
his
habits
or
his
business
five
never
under
any
circumstances
to
go
farther
eastward
into
london
than
is
represented
by
a
line
drawn
from
the
marble
arch
to
victoria
station
six
never
to
recognize
my
employer
if
i
see
him
in
the
street
in
company
with
any
other
person
the
chauffeur
folded
the
card
and
scratched
his
chin
reflectively
eccentricity
he
said
it
was
a
nice
word
and
its
employment
was
a
comfort
to
this
perturbed
australian
he
cleaned
his
face
and
hands
and
went
into
the
tiny
kitchen
to
prepare
his
master
dinner
holland
house
was
a
remarkable
one
it
was
filled
with
every
form
of
device
which
the
ingenuity
of
man
could
devise
the
furniture
if
luxurious
was
not
in
any
great
quantity
vacuum
tubes
were
to
be
found
in
every
room
and
by
the
attachment
of
hose
and
nozzle
and
the
pressure
of
a
switch
each
room
could
be
dusted
in
a
few
minutes
from
the
kitchen
at
the
back
of
the
cottage
to
the
dining
room
ran
two
endless
belts
electrically
controlled
which
presently
carried
to
the
table
the
very
simple
meal
which
his
had
prepared
the
remnants
of
dinner
were
cleared
away
the
chauffeur
dismissed
to
his
quarters
a
little
building
separated
from
the
cottage
and
the
switch
was
turned
over
which
heated
the
automatic
coffee
percolator
which
stood
on
the
sideboard
holland
sat
reading
his
feet
resting
on
a
chair
he
only
interrupted
his
study
long
enough
to
draw
off
the
coffee
into
a
little
white
cup
and
to
switch
off
the
current
he
sat
until
the
little
silver
clock
on
the
mantelshelf
struck
twelve
and
then
he
placed
a
card
in
the
book
to
mark
the
place
closed
it
and
rose
leisurely
he
slid
back
a
panel
in
the
wall
disclosing
the
steel
door
of
a
safe
this
he
opened
with
a
key
which
he
selected
from
a
bunch
from
the
interior
of
the
safe
he
removed
a
cedarwood
box
also
locked
he
threw
back
the
lid
and
removed
one
by
one
three
check
books
and
a
pair
of
gloves
of
some
thin
transparent
fabric
these
were
obviously
to
guard
against
finger
prints
he
carefully
pulled
them
on
and
buttoned
them
next
he
detached
three
checks
one
from
each
book
and
taking
a
fountain
pen
from
his
pocket
he
began
filling
in
the
blank
spaces
he
wrote
slowly
almost
laboriously
and
he
wrote
without
a
copy
there
are
very
few
forgers
in
the
criminal
records
who
have
ever
accomplished
the
feat
of
imitating
a
man
signature
from
memory
rex
holland
was
singularly
exceptional
to
all
precedent
for
from
the
date
to
the
flourishing
signature
these
checks
might
have
been
written
and
signed
by
john
minute
there
were
the
same
fantastic
e
the
same
y
even
john
minute
might
have
been
in
doubt
whether
he
wrote
the
eight
hundred
and
fifty
which
appeared
on
one
slip
holland
surveyed
his
handiwork
without
emotion
he
waited
for
the
ink
to
dry
before
he
folded
the
checks
and
put
them
in
his
pocket
this
was
john
minute
way
for
the
millionaire
never
used
blotting
paper
for
some
reason
probably
not
unconnected
with
an
event
in
his
earlier
career
when
the
checks
were
in
his
pocket
holland
removed
his
gloves
replaced
them
with
the
check
books
in
the
box
and
in
the
safe
locked
the
steel
door
drew
the
sliding
panel
and
went
to
bed
early
the
next
morning
he
summoned
his
servant
take
the
car
back
to
town
he
said
i
am
going
back
by
train
meet
me
at
the
holland
park
tube
at
two
i
have
a
little
job
for
you
which
will
earn
you
five
hundred
that
my
job
sir
said
the
dazed
man
when
he
recovered
from
the
shock
frank
sometimes
accompanied
may
to
the
east
end
and
on
the
day
rex
holland
returned
to
london
he
called
for
the
girl
at
her
flat
to
drive
her
to
canning
town
you
can
come
in
and
have
some
tea
she
invited
you
a
luxurious
beggar
may
he
said
glancing
round
approvingly
at
the
prettily
furnished
sitting
room
contrast
this
with
my
humble
abode
in
bayswater
i
do
know
your
humble
abode
in
bayswater
she
laughed
but
why
on
earth
you
should
elect
to
live
at
bayswater
i
ca
imagine
he
sipped
his
tea
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
guess
what
income
the
heir
of
the
minute
millions
enjoys
he
asked
ironically
no
i
save
you
the
agony
of
guessing
i
earn
seven
pounds
a
week
at
the
bank
and
that
is
the
whole
of
my
income
but
does
uncle
she
began
in
surprise
not
a
bob
replied
frank
vulgarly
not
half
a
bob
but
i
know
what
you
going
to
say
he
treats
you
generously
i
know
he
treats
me
justly
between
generosity
and
justice
give
me
generosity
all
the
time
i
will
tell
you
something
else
he
pays
jasper
cole
a
thousand
a
year
it
very
curious
is
it
she
leaned
over
and
patted
his
arm
poor
boy
she
said
sympathetically
that
does
make
it
any
easier
jasper
i
mean
frank
indulged
in
a
little
grimace
and
said
by
the
way
i
saw
the
mysterious
jasper
this
morning
coming
out
of
the
waterloo
station
looking
more
mysterious
than
ever
what
particular
business
has
he
in
the
country
she
shook
her
head
and
rose
i
know
as
little
about
jasper
as
you
she
answered
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
thoughtfully
frank
she
said
i
am
rather
worried
about
you
and
jasper
i
am
worried
because
your
uncle
does
not
seem
to
take
the
same
view
of
jasper
as
you
take
it
is
not
a
very
heroic
position
for
either
of
you
and
it
is
rather
hateful
for
me
frank
looked
at
her
with
a
quizzical
smile
why
hateful
for
you
she
shook
her
head
i
would
like
to
tell
you
everything
but
that
would
not
be
fair
to
whom
frank
asked
quickly
to
you
your
uncle
or
to
jasper
he
came
nearer
to
her
have
you
so
warm
a
feeling
for
jasper
he
asked
i
have
no
warm
feeling
for
anybody
she
said
candidly
oh
look
so
glum
frank
i
suppose
i
am
slow
to
develop
but
you
can
not
expect
me
to
have
any
very
decided
views
yet
a
while
frank
smiled
ruefully
that
is
my
one
big
trouble
dear
he
said
quietly
bigger
than
anything
else
in
the
world
she
stood
with
her
hand
on
the
door
hesitating
a
look
of
perplexity
upon
her
beautiful
face
she
was
of
the
tall
slender
type
a
girl
slowly
ripening
into
womanhood
she
might
have
been
described
as
cold
and
a
little
repressive
but
the
truth
was
that
she
was
as
yet
untouched
by
the
fires
of
passion
and
for
all
her
years
she
was
still
something
of
the
healthy
schoolgirl
with
a
schoolgirl
impatience
of
sentiment
i
am
the
last
to
spin
a
yarn
frank
went
on
but
i
have
not
had
the
best
of
everything
dear
i
started
wrong
with
uncle
he
never
liked
my
father
nor
any
of
my
father
family
his
treatment
of
his
wife
was
infamous
my
poor
governor
was
one
of
those
fellows
who
was
always
in
trouble
and
it
was
always
john
minute
job
to
get
him
out
i
do
like
talking
about
him
he
hesitated
she
nodded
i
know
she
said
sympathetically
father
was
not
the
rotter
that
uncle
john
thinks
he
was
he
had
his
good
points
he
was
careless
and
he
drank
much
more
than
was
good
for
him
but
all
the
scrapes
he
fell
into
were
due
to
this
latter
failing
the
girl
knew
the
story
of
doctor
merrill
it
had
been
sketched
briefly
but
vividly
by
john
minute
she
knew
also
some
of
those
scrapes
which
had
involved
doctor
merrill
ruin
material
and
moral
frank
she
said
if
i
can
help
you
in
any
way
i
would
do
it
you
can
help
me
absolutely
said
the
young
man
quietly
by
marrying
me
she
gasped
when
she
asked
startled
now
next
week
at
any
rate
soon
he
smiled
and
crossing
to
her
caught
her
hand
in
his
may
dear
you
know
i
love
you
you
know
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
i
would
not
do
for
you
no
sacrifice
that
i
would
not
make
she
shook
her
head
you
must
give
me
some
time
to
think
about
this
frank
she
said
do
go
he
begged
you
can
not
know
how
urgent
is
my
need
of
you
uncle
john
has
told
you
a
great
deal
about
me
but
has
he
told
you
this
that
my
only
hope
of
independence
independence
of
his
millions
and
his
influence
you
can
not
know
how
widespread
or
pernicious
that
influence
is
he
said
with
an
unaccustomed
passion
in
his
voice
lies
in
my
marriage
before
my
birthday
frank
it
is
true
i
can
not
tell
you
any
more
but
john
minute
knows
if
i
am
married
within
the
next
ten
days
he
snapped
his
fingers
that
for
his
millions
i
am
independent
of
his
legacies
independent
of
his
patronage
she
stared
at
him
you
never
told
me
this
before
he
shook
his
head
a
little
despairingly
there
are
some
things
i
can
never
tell
you
may
and
some
things
which
you
can
never
know
till
we
are
married
i
only
ask
you
to
trust
me
but
suppose
she
faltered
you
are
not
married
within
ten
days
what
will
happen
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
am
john
liege
man
of
life
and
limb
and
of
earthly
regard
he
quoted
flippantly
i
shall
wait
hopefully
for
the
only
release
that
can
come
the
release
which
his
death
will
bring
i
hate
saying
that
for
there
is
something
about
him
that
i
like
enormously
but
that
is
the
truth
and
may
he
said
still
holding
her
hand
and
looking
earnestly
into
her
face
i
do
want
to
feel
like
that
about
john
minute
i
do
want
to
look
forward
to
his
end
i
want
to
meet
him
without
any
sense
of
dependence
i
do
want
to
be
looking
all
the
time
for
signs
of
decay
and
decrepitude
and
hail
each
illness
he
may
have
with
a
feeling
of
pleasant
anticipation
it
is
beastly
of
me
to
talk
like
this
i
know
but
if
you
were
in
my
position
if
you
knew
all
that
i
know
you
would
understand
the
girl
mind
was
in
a
ferment
an
ordinary
meeting
had
developed
so
tumultuously
that
she
had
lost
her
command
of
the
situation
a
hundred
thoughts
ran
riot
through
her
mind
she
felt
as
though
she
were
an
arbitrator
deciding
between
two
men
of
both
of
whom
she
was
fond
and
even
at
that
moment
there
intruded
into
her
mental
vision
a
picture
of
jasper
cole
with
his
pale
intellectual
face
and
his
grave
dark
eyes
i
must
think
about
this
she
said
again
i
do
think
you
had
better
come
down
to
the
mission
with
me
he
nodded
perhaps
you
right
he
said
gently
she
released
her
hand
and
left
him
for
her
that
day
was
one
of
supreme
mental
perturbation
what
was
the
extraordinary
reason
which
compelled
his
marriage
by
his
birthday
she
remembered
how
john
minute
had
insisted
that
her
thoughts
about
marriage
should
be
at
least
postponed
for
the
next
fortnight
why
had
john
minute
suddenly
sprung
this
story
of
her
legacy
upon
her
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
began
to
regard
her
uncle
with
suspicion
for
frank
the
day
did
not
develop
without
its
sensations
the
piccadilly
branch
of
the
london
and
western
counties
bank
occupies
commodious
premises
but
frank
had
never
been
granted
the
use
of
a
private
office
his
big
desk
was
in
a
corner
remote
from
the
counter
surrounded
on
three
sides
by
a
screen
which
was
half
glass
and
half
teak
paneling
from
where
he
sat
he
could
secure
a
view
of
the
counter
a
necessary
provision
since
he
was
occasionally
called
upon
to
identify
the
bearers
of
checks
he
returned
a
little
before
three
in
the
afternoon
and
brandon
the
manager
came
hurriedly
from
his
little
sanctum
at
the
rear
of
the
premises
and
beckoned
frank
into
his
office
you
taken
an
awful
long
time
for
lunch
he
complained
i
sorry
said
frank
i
met
miss
nuttall
and
the
time
flew
did
you
see
holland
the
other
day
the
manager
interrupted
i
did
see
him
on
the
day
you
sent
me
replied
frank
but
i
saw
him
on
the
following
day
is
he
a
friend
of
your
uncle
i
do
think
so
why
do
you
ask
the
manager
took
up
three
checks
which
lay
on
the
table
and
frank
examined
them
one
was
for
eight
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
six
shillings
and
was
drawn
upon
the
liverpool
cotton
bank
one
was
for
thousand
one
hundred
and
forty
pounds
and
was
drawn
upon
the
bank
of
england
and
the
other
was
for
seven
thousand
nine
hundred
and
pounds
fourteen
shillings
they
were
all
signed
john
minute
and
they
were
all
made
payable
to
rex
holland
esquire
and
were
crossed
now
john
minute
had
a
very
curious
practice
of
splitting
up
payments
so
that
they
covered
the
three
banking
houses
at
which
his
money
was
deposited
the
check
for
seven
thousand
nine
hundred
and
pounds
fourteen
shillings
was
drawn
upon
the
london
and
western
counties
bank
and
that
would
have
afforded
the
manager
some
clew
even
if
he
had
not
been
well
acquainted
with
john
minute
eccentricity
seven
thousand
nine
hundred
and
pounds
fourteen
shillings
from
mr
minute
balance
said
the
manager
leaves
exactly
fifty
thousand
pounds
brandon
shook
his
head
in
despair
at
the
unbusinesslike
methods
of
his
patron
does
he
know
your
uncle
who
rex
holland
frank
frowned
in
an
effort
of
memory
i
do
remember
my
uncle
ever
speaking
of
him
and
yet
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
one
of
the
first
checks
he
put
into
the
bank
was
on
my
uncle
account
yes
now
i
remember
he
exclaimed
he
opened
the
account
on
a
letter
of
introduction
which
was
signed
by
mr
minute
i
thought
at
the
time
that
they
had
probably
had
business
dealings
together
and
as
uncle
never
encourages
the
discussion
of
bank
affairs
outside
of
the
bank
i
have
never
mentioned
it
to
him
again
brandon
shook
his
head
in
doubt
i
must
say
merrill
he
said
i
do
like
these
mysterious
depositors
what
is
he
like
in
appearance
rather
a
tall
youngish
man
exquisitely
dressed
clean
shaven
no
he
has
a
closely
trimmed
black
beard
though
he
can
not
be
much
more
than
in
fact
when
i
saw
him
for
the
first
time
the
face
was
familiar
to
me
and
i
had
an
impression
of
having
seen
him
before
i
think
he
was
wearing
a
eyeglass
when
he
came
on
the
first
occasion
but
i
have
never
met
him
in
the
street
and
he
hardly
moves
in
my
humble
social
circle
frank
smiled
i
suppose
it
is
all
right
said
the
manager
dubiously
but
anyway
i
see
him
as
a
precautionary
measure
we
might
get
in
touch
with
your
uncle
though
i
know
he
raise
cain
if
we
bother
him
about
his
account
he
will
certainly
raise
cain
if
you
get
in
touch
with
him
smiled
frank
for
he
is
due
to
leave
by
the
this
afternoon
for
paris
it
wanted
five
minutes
to
the
hour
at
which
the
bank
closed
when
a
clerk
came
through
the
swing
door
and
laid
a
letter
upon
the
counter
which
was
taken
in
to
brandon
who
came
into
the
office
immediately
and
crossed
to
where
frank
sat
look
at
this
he
said
frank
took
the
letter
and
read
it
it
was
addressed
to
the
manager
and
ran
dear
sir
i
am
leaving
for
paris
to
join
my
partner
mr
minute
i
shall
be
very
glad
therefore
if
you
will
arrange
to
cash
the
inclosed
check
yours
faithfully
rex
holland
the
inclosed
check
was
for
thousand
pounds
and
was
within
five
thousand
pounds
of
the
amount
standing
to
holland
account
in
the
bank
there
was
a
postscript
to
the
letter
you
will
accept
this
my
receipt
for
the
sum
and
hand
it
to
my
messenger
sergeant
george
graylin
of
the
corps
of
commissionaires
and
this
form
of
receipt
will
serve
to
indemnify
you
against
loss
in
the
event
of
mishap
the
manager
walked
to
the
counter
who
gave
you
this
letter
he
asked
holland
sir
said
the
man
where
is
mr
holland
asked
frank
the
sergeant
shook
his
head
at
his
flat
my
instructions
were
to
take
this
letter
to
the
bank
and
bring
back
the
money
the
manager
was
in
a
quandary
it
was
a
regular
transaction
and
it
was
by
no
means
unusual
to
pay
out
money
in
this
way
it
was
only
the
largeness
of
the
sum
which
made
him
hesitate
he
disappeared
into
his
office
and
came
back
with
two
bundles
of
notes
which
he
had
taken
from
the
safe
he
counted
them
over
placed
them
in
a
sealed
envelope
and
received
from
the
sergeant
his
receipt
when
the
man
had
gone
brandon
wiped
his
forehead
phew
he
said
i
do
like
this
way
of
doing
business
very
much
and
i
should
be
very
glad
indeed
to
be
transferred
back
to
the
head
office
the
words
were
hardly
out
of
his
mouth
when
a
bell
rang
violently
the
front
doors
of
the
bank
had
been
closed
with
the
departure
of
the
commissioner
and
one
of
the
junior
clerks
balancing
up
his
day
book
dropped
his
pen
and
at
a
sign
from
his
chief
walking
to
the
door
pulled
back
the
bolts
and
admitted
john
minute
frank
stared
at
him
in
astonishment
hello
uncle
he
said
i
wish
you
had
come
a
few
minutes
before
i
thought
you
were
in
paris
the
wire
calling
me
to
paris
was
a
fake
growled
john
minute
i
wired
for
confirmation
and
discovered
my
paris
people
had
not
sent
me
any
message
i
only
got
the
wire
just
before
the
train
started
i
have
been
spending
all
the
afternoon
getting
on
to
the
phone
to
paris
to
untangle
the
muddle
why
did
you
wish
i
was
here
five
minutes
before
because
said
frank
we
have
just
paid
out
thousand
pounds
to
your
friend
mr
holland
my
friend
john
minute
stared
from
the
manager
to
frank
and
from
frank
to
the
manager
who
suddenly
experienced
a
sinking
feeling
which
accompanies
disaster
what
do
you
mean
by
friend
asked
john
minute
i
have
never
heard
of
the
man
before
did
you
give
holland
checks
amounting
to
thousand
pounds
this
morning
gasped
the
manager
turning
suddenly
pale
certainly
not
roared
john
minute
why
the
devil
should
i
give
him
checks
i
have
never
heard
of
the
man
the
manager
grasped
the
counter
for
support
he
explained
the
situation
in
a
few
halting
words
and
led
the
way
to
his
office
frank
accompanying
him
john
minute
examined
the
checks
that
is
my
writing
he
said
i
could
swear
to
it
myself
and
yet
i
never
wrote
those
checks
or
signed
them
did
you
note
the
commissionaire
number
as
it
happens
i
jotted
it
down
said
frank
by
this
time
the
manager
was
on
the
phone
to
the
police
at
seven
that
night
the
commissionaire
was
discovered
he
had
been
employed
he
said
by
a
holland
whom
he
described
as
a
slimmish
man
clean
shaven
and
by
no
means
answering
to
the
description
which
frank
had
given
i
have
lived
for
a
long
time
in
australia
said
the
commissionaire
and
he
spoke
like
an
australian
in
fact
when
i
mentioned
certain
places
i
had
been
to
he
told
me
he
knew
them
the
police
further
discovered
that
the
knightsbridge
flat
had
been
taken
furnished
three
months
before
by
rex
holland
the
negotiations
having
been
by
letter
holland
agent
had
assumed
responsibility
for
the
flat
and
holland
agent
was
easily
discoverable
in
a
clerk
in
the
employment
of
a
firm
of
surveyors
and
auctioneers
who
had
also
received
his
commission
by
letter
when
the
police
searched
the
flat
they
found
only
one
thing
which
helped
them
in
their
investigations
the
hall
porter
said
that
as
often
as
not
the
flat
was
untenanted
and
only
occasionally
when
he
was
off
duty
had
holland
put
in
an
appearance
and
he
only
knew
this
from
statements
which
had
been
made
by
other
tenants
it
comes
to
this
said
john
minute
grimly
that
nobody
has
seen
holland
but
you
frank
frank
stiffened
i
am
not
suggesting
that
you
are
in
the
swindle
said
minute
gruffly
as
likely
as
not
the
man
you
saw
was
not
holland
and
it
is
probably
the
work
of
a
gang
but
i
am
going
to
find
out
who
this
man
is
if
i
have
to
spend
twice
as
much
as
i
have
lost
the
police
were
not
encouraging
detective
inspector
nash
from
scotland
yard
who
had
handled
some
of
the
biggest
cases
of
bank
swindles
held
out
no
hope
of
the
money
being
recovered
in
theory
you
can
get
back
the
notes
if
you
have
their
numbers
he
said
but
in
practice
it
is
almost
impossible
to
recover
them
because
it
is
quite
easy
to
change
even
notes
for
five
hundred
pounds
and
probably
you
will
find
these
in
circulation
in
a
week
or
two
his
speculation
proved
to
be
correct
for
on
the
third
day
after
the
crime
three
of
the
missing
notes
made
a
curious
appearance
minute
true
to
his
nickname
was
in
the
habit
of
balancing
his
accounts
as
between
bank
and
bank
by
cash
payments
he
had
made
it
a
practice
for
all
his
dividends
to
be
paid
in
actual
cash
and
these
were
sent
to
the
piccadilly
branch
of
the
london
and
western
counties
bank
in
bulk
after
a
payment
of
a
very
large
sum
on
account
of
certain
dividends
accruing
from
his
south
african
investments
three
of
the
missing
notes
were
discovered
in
the
bank
itself
john
minute
apprised
by
telegram
of
the
fact
said
nothing
for
the
money
had
been
paid
in
by
his
confidential
secretary
jasper
cole
and
there
was
excellent
reason
why
he
did
not
desire
to
emphasize
the
fact
chapter
viii
sergeant
smith
calls
the
big
library
of
weald
lodge
was
brilliantly
lighted
and
nobody
had
pulled
down
the
blinds
so
that
it
was
possible
for
any
man
who
troubled
to
jump
the
low
stone
wall
which
ran
by
the
road
and
push
a
way
through
the
damp
shrubbery
to
see
all
that
was
happening
in
the
room
weald
lodge
stands
between
eastbourne
and
wilmington
and
in
the
winter
months
the
curious
represented
by
youthful
holiday
makers
are
few
and
far
between
constable
wiseman
of
the
eastbourne
constabulary
certainly
was
not
curious
he
paced
his
slow
moist
way
and
merely
noted
in
passing
the
fact
that
the
flood
of
light
reflected
on
the
little
patch
of
lawn
at
the
side
of
the
house
the
hour
was
nine
on
a
june
evening
and
officially
it
was
only
the
hour
of
sunset
though
lowering
rain
clouds
had
so
darkened
the
world
that
night
had
closed
down
upon
the
weald
had
blotted
out
its
pleasant
villages
and
had
hidden
the
green
downs
he
continued
to
the
end
of
his
beat
and
met
his
impatient
superior
everything
all
right
sergeant
he
reported
only
old
lights
are
blazing
away
and
his
windows
are
open
better
go
and
warn
him
said
the
sergeant
pulling
his
bicycle
into
position
for
mounting
he
had
his
foot
on
the
treadle
but
hesitated
i
warn
him
myself
but
i
do
think
he
be
glad
to
see
me
he
grinned
to
himself
then
remarked
something
queer
about
minute
eh
there
is
indeed
agreed
constable
wiseman
heartily
his
beat
was
a
lonely
one
and
he
was
a
very
bored
man
if
by
agreement
with
his
officer
he
could
induce
that
loquacious
gentleman
to
talk
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
so
much
dull
time
might
be
passed
the
fact
that
sergeant
smith
was
loquacious
indicated
too
that
he
had
been
drinking
and
was
ready
to
quarrel
with
anybody
come
under
the
shelter
of
that
wall
said
the
sergeant
and
pushed
his
machine
to
the
protection
afforded
by
the
side
wall
of
a
house
it
is
possible
that
the
sergeant
was
anxious
to
impress
upon
his
subordinate
mind
a
point
of
view
which
might
be
useful
to
himself
one
day
minute
is
a
dangerous
old
man
he
said
do
i
know
it
said
constable
wiseman
with
the
recollection
of
sundry
reportings
and
inquiries
you
got
to
remember
that
wiseman
the
sergeant
went
on
and
by
i
mean
that
he
the
sort
of
old
fellow
that
would
ask
a
constable
to
come
in
to
have
a
drink
and
then
report
him
good
lord
said
the
shocked
wiseman
at
this
revelation
of
the
blackest
treachery
sergeant
smith
nodded
that
the
sort
of
man
he
is
he
said
i
knew
him
years
ago
at
least
i
seen
him
i
was
in
matabeleland
with
him
and
i
tell
you
there
nothing
too
mean
for
minute
curse
him
i
bet
you
have
had
a
terrible
life
sergeant
encouraged
constable
wiseman
the
other
laughed
bitterly
i
have
he
said
sergeant
smith
acquaintance
with
eastbourne
was
a
short
one
he
had
only
been
four
years
in
the
town
and
had
so
rumor
ran
owed
his
promotion
to
influence
what
that
influence
was
none
could
say
it
had
been
suggested
that
john
minute
himself
had
secured
him
his
stripes
but
that
was
a
theory
which
was
by
people
who
knew
that
the
sergeant
had
little
that
was
good
to
say
of
his
supposed
patron
constable
wiseman
a
profound
thinker
and
a
secret
reader
of
sensational
detective
stories
had
at
one
time
made
a
report
against
john
minute
for
some
technical
offense
and
had
made
it
in
fear
and
trembling
expecting
his
sergeant
promptly
to
squash
this
attempt
to
persecute
his
patron
but
to
his
surprise
and
delight
sergeant
smith
had
furthered
his
efforts
and
had
helped
to
secure
the
conviction
which
involved
a
fine
you
go
on
and
finish
your
beat
constable
said
the
sergeant
suddenly
and
i
ride
up
to
the
old
devil
house
and
see
what
doing
he
mounted
his
bicycle
and
trundled
up
the
hill
dismounting
before
weald
lodge
and
propped
his
bicycle
against
the
wall
he
looked
for
a
long
time
toward
the
open
french
windows
and
then
jumping
the
wall
made
his
way
slowly
across
the
lawn
avoiding
the
gravel
path
which
would
betray
his
presence
he
got
to
a
point
opposite
the
window
which
commanded
a
full
view
of
the
room
though
the
window
was
open
there
was
a
fire
in
the
grate
to
the
sergeant
satisfaction
john
minute
was
alone
he
sat
in
a
deep
armchair
in
his
favorite
attitude
his
hands
pushed
into
his
pockets
his
head
upon
his
chest
he
heard
the
sergeant
foot
upon
the
gravel
and
stood
up
as
the
figure
appeared
at
the
open
window
oh
it
is
you
is
it
growled
john
minute
what
do
you
want
alone
said
the
sergeant
and
he
spoke
as
one
to
his
equal
come
in
mr
minute
library
had
been
furnished
by
the
artistic
furniture
company
of
eastbourne
which
had
branches
at
hastings
bexhill
brighton
and
it
was
claimed
at
london
the
furniture
was
of
dark
oak
busily
carved
there
was
a
large
bookcase
which
half
covered
one
wall
this
was
the
library
and
it
was
filled
with
books
of
uniform
binding
which
occupied
the
shelves
the
books
had
been
supplied
by
a
great
bookseller
of
london
and
included
at
mr
minute
suggestion
the
hundred
best
books
books
that
have
helped
me
the
encyclopedia
brillonica
and
twenty
bound
volumes
of
a
certain
weekly
periodical
of
international
reputation
john
minute
had
no
literary
leanings
the
sergeant
hesitated
wiped
his
heavy
boots
on
the
sodden
mat
outside
the
window
and
walked
into
the
room
you
are
pretty
cozy
john
he
said
what
do
you
want
asked
minute
without
enthusiasm
i
thought
i
look
you
up
my
constable
reported
your
windows
were
open
and
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
come
along
and
warn
you
there
are
thieves
about
john
i
know
of
one
said
john
minute
looking
at
the
other
steadily
your
constable
as
you
call
him
is
i
presume
that
jackass
wiseman
got
him
first
time
said
the
sergeant
removing
his
waterproof
cape
i
do
often
trouble
you
but
somehow
i
had
a
feeling
i
like
to
see
you
my
constable
revived
old
memories
john
unpleasant
for
you
i
hope
said
john
minute
ungraciously
there
a
nice
little
gold
farm
four
hundred
miles
north
of
gwelo
said
sergeant
smith
meditatively
and
a
nice
little
breakwater
half
a
mile
south
of
cape
town
said
john
minute
where
the
cape
government
keeps
highwaymen
who
hold
up
the
salisbury
coach
and
rob
the
mails
sergeant
smith
smiled
you
will
have
your
little
joke
he
said
but
i
might
remind
you
that
they
have
plenty
of
accommodation
on
the
breakwater
john
they
even
take
care
of
men
who
have
stolen
land
and
murdered
natives
what
do
you
want
asked
john
minute
again
the
other
grinned
just
a
pleasant
little
friendly
visit
he
explained
i
have
looked
you
up
for
twelve
months
it
is
a
hard
life
this
police
work
even
when
you
have
got
two
or
three
pounds
a
week
from
a
private
source
to
add
to
your
pay
it
is
nothing
like
the
work
we
have
in
the
matabele
mounted
police
eh
john
but
lord
he
said
looking
into
the
fire
thoughtfully
when
i
think
how
i
stood
up
in
the
attorney
office
at
salisbury
and
took
my
solemn
oath
that
old
john
gedding
had
transferred
his
saibach
gold
claims
to
you
on
his
death
bed
when
i
think
of
the
amount
of
perjury
me
a
uniformed
servant
of
the
british
south
african
company
and
so
to
speak
an
official
of
the
law
i
blush
for
myself
do
you
ever
blush
for
yourself
when
you
think
of
how
you
and
your
pals
held
up
hoffman
store
shot
hoffman
and
took
his
swag
asked
john
minute
i
give
a
lot
of
money
to
see
you
blush
crawley
and
now
for
about
the
fourteenth
time
what
do
you
want
if
it
is
money
you
have
it
if
it
is
more
promotion
you
are
not
fit
to
have
it
if
it
is
a
word
of
advice
the
other
stopped
him
with
a
motion
of
his
hand
i
ca
afford
to
have
your
advice
john
he
said
all
i
know
is
that
you
promised
me
my
fair
share
over
those
saibach
claims
it
is
a
paying
mine
now
they
tell
me
that
its
capital
is
two
millions
you
were
well
paid
said
john
minute
shortly
five
hundred
pounds
is
much
for
the
surrender
of
your
salvation
said
sergeant
smith
he
slowly
replaced
his
cape
on
his
broad
shoulders
and
walked
to
the
window
listen
here
john
minute
all
the
good
nature
had
gone
out
of
his
voice
and
it
was
trooper
henry
crawley
the
lawbreaker
who
spoke
you
are
not
going
to
satisfy
me
much
longer
with
a
few
pounds
a
week
you
have
got
to
do
the
right
thing
by
me
or
i
am
going
to
blow
let
me
know
when
your
blowing
starts
said
john
minute
and
i
send
you
a
bowl
of
soup
to
cool
you
funny
but
you
do
amuse
me
were
the
last
words
of
the
sergeant
as
he
walked
into
the
rain
as
before
he
avoided
the
drive
and
jumped
over
the
low
wall
on
to
the
road
and
was
glad
that
he
had
done
so
for
a
motor
car
swung
into
the
drive
and
pulled
up
before
the
dark
doorway
of
the
house
he
was
over
the
wall
again
in
an
instant
and
crossing
with
swift
noiseless
steps
in
the
direction
of
the
car
he
got
as
close
as
he
could
and
listened
two
of
the
voices
he
recognized
the
third
that
of
a
man
was
a
stranger
he
heard
this
third
person
called
inspector
and
wondered
who
was
the
guest
his
curiosity
was
not
to
be
satisfied
for
by
the
time
he
had
reached
the
view
place
on
the
lawn
which
overlooked
the
library
john
minute
had
closed
the
windows
and
pulled
down
the
blinds
the
visitors
to
weald
lodge
were
three
jasper
cole
may
nuttall
and
a
stout
man
of
slow
speech
but
of
authoritative
tone
this
was
inspector
nash
of
scotland
yard
who
was
in
charge
of
the
investigations
into
the
forgeries
minute
received
them
in
the
library
he
knew
the
inspector
of
old
jasper
had
brought
may
down
in
response
to
the
telegraphed
instructions
which
john
minute
had
sent
him
what
the
news
he
asked
well
i
think
i
have
found
your
holland
said
the
inspector
he
took
a
fat
case
from
his
inside
pocket
opened
it
and
extracted
a
snapshot
photograph
it
represented
a
big
motor
car
and
standing
by
its
bonnet
a
little
man
in
chauffeur
uniform
this
is
the
fellow
who
called
himself
holland
and
who
sent
the
commissionaire
on
his
errand
the
photograph
came
into
my
possession
as
the
result
of
an
accident
it
was
discovered
in
the
flat
and
had
evidently
fallen
out
of
the
man
pocket
i
made
inquiries
and
found
that
it
was
taken
by
a
small
photographer
in
putney
and
that
the
man
had
called
for
the
photographs
about
ten
in
the
morning
of
the
same
day
that
he
sent
the
commissionaire
on
his
errand
he
was
probably
examining
them
during
the
period
of
his
waiting
in
the
flat
and
one
of
them
slipped
to
the
ground
at
any
rate
the
commissionaire
has
no
doubt
that
this
was
the
man
do
you
seriously
suggest
that
this
fellow
is
rex
holland
the
inspector
shook
his
head
i
think
he
is
merely
one
of
the
gang
he
said
i
do
believe
you
will
ever
find
rex
holland
for
each
of
the
gang
took
the
name
in
turn
to
take
the
part
according
to
the
circumstances
in
which
they
found
themselves
i
have
been
unable
to
identify
him
except
that
he
went
by
the
name
of
feltham
and
was
an
australian
that
was
the
name
he
gave
to
the
photographer
with
whom
he
talked
you
see
the
photograph
was
taken
in
high
street
putney
the
only
clew
we
have
is
that
he
has
been
seen
several
times
on
the
portsmouth
road
driving
one
or
two
cars
in
which
was
a
man
who
is
probably
the
nearest
approach
to
rex
holland
we
shall
get
i
put
my
men
on
to
make
further
investigations
and
the
haslemere
police
told
them
that
it
is
believed
that
the
car
was
the
property
of
a
gentleman
who
lived
in
a
lockup
cottage
some
distance
from
haslemere
evidently
rather
a
swagger
affair
because
its
owner
had
an
electric
cable
and
telephone
wires
laid
in
and
the
cottage
was
altered
and
renovated
twelve
months
ago
at
a
very
considerable
cost
i
shall
be
able
to
tell
you
more
about
that
they
spent
the
rest
of
the
evening
discussing
the
crime
and
the
girl
was
a
silent
listener
it
was
not
until
very
late
that
john
minute
was
able
to
give
her
his
undivided
attention
i
asked
you
to
come
down
he
said
because
i
am
getting
a
little
worried
about
you
worried
about
me
uncle
she
said
in
surprise
he
nodded
the
two
men
had
gone
off
to
jasper
study
and
she
was
alone
with
her
uncle
when
i
lunched
with
you
the
other
day
at
the
savoy
he
said
i
spoke
to
you
about
your
marriage
and
i
asked
you
to
defer
any
action
for
a
fortnight
she
nodded
i
was
coming
down
to
see
you
on
that
very
matter
she
said
uncle
wo
you
tell
me
why
you
want
me
to
delay
my
marriage
for
a
fortnight
and
why
you
think
i
am
going
to
get
married
at
all
he
did
not
answer
immediately
but
paced
up
and
down
the
room
may
he
said
you
have
heard
a
great
deal
about
me
which
is
not
very
flattering
i
lived
a
very
rough
life
in
south
africa
and
i
only
had
one
friend
in
the
world
in
whom
i
had
the
slightest
confidence
that
friend
was
your
father
he
stood
by
me
in
my
bad
times
he
never
worried
me
when
i
was
flush
of
money
never
denied
me
when
i
was
broke
whenever
he
helped
me
he
was
content
with
what
reward
i
offered
him
there
was
no
with
bill
nuttall
he
was
a
man
who
had
no
ambition
no
avarice
the
whitest
man
i
have
ever
met
what
i
have
not
told
you
about
him
is
this
he
and
i
were
equal
partners
in
a
mine
the
gwelo
deep
he
had
great
faith
in
the
mine
and
i
had
none
at
all
i
knew
it
to
be
one
of
those
properties
you
sometimes
get
in
rhodesia
all
pocket
and
outcrop
anyway
we
floated
a
company
he
stopped
and
chuckled
as
at
an
amusing
memory
the
pound
shares
were
worth
a
little
less
than
sixpence
until
a
fortnight
ago
he
looked
at
her
with
one
of
those
swift
penetrating
glances
as
though
he
were
anxious
to
discover
her
thoughts
a
fortnight
ago
he
said
i
learned
from
my
agent
in
bulawayo
that
a
reef
had
been
struck
on
an
adjoining
mine
and
that
the
reef
runs
through
our
property
if
that
is
true
you
will
be
a
rich
woman
in
your
own
right
apart
from
the
money
you
get
from
me
i
can
not
tell
whether
it
is
true
until
i
have
heard
from
the
engineers
who
are
now
examining
the
property
and
i
can
not
know
that
for
a
fortnight
may
you
are
a
dear
girl
he
said
and
laid
his
hand
on
her
arm
and
i
have
looked
after
you
as
though
you
were
my
own
daughter
it
is
a
happiness
to
me
to
know
that
you
will
be
a
very
rich
woman
because
your
father
shares
was
the
only
property
you
inherited
from
him
there
is
however
one
curious
thing
about
it
that
i
can
not
understand
he
walked
over
to
the
bureau
unlocked
a
drawer
and
took
out
a
letter
my
agent
says
that
he
advised
me
two
years
ago
that
this
reef
existed
and
wondered
why
i
had
never
given
him
authority
to
bore
i
have
no
recollection
of
his
ever
having
told
me
anything
of
the
sort
now
you
know
the
position
he
said
putting
back
the
letter
and
closing
the
drawer
with
a
bang
you
want
me
to
wait
for
a
better
match
said
the
girl
he
inclined
his
head
i
do
want
you
to
get
married
for
a
fortnight
he
repeated
may
nuttall
went
to
bed
that
night
full
of
doubt
and
more
than
a
little
unhappy
the
story
that
john
minute
told
about
her
father
was
it
true
was
it
a
story
invented
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
to
counter
plan
she
thought
of
frank
and
his
almost
solemn
entreaty
there
had
been
no
mistaking
his
earnestness
or
his
sincerity
if
he
would
only
take
her
into
his
confidence
and
yet
she
recognized
and
was
surprised
at
the
revelation
that
she
did
not
want
that
confidence
she
wanted
to
help
frank
very
badly
and
it
was
not
the
romance
of
the
situation
which
appealed
to
her
there
was
a
large
sense
of
duty
something
of
that
mother
sense
which
every
woman
possesses
which
tempted
her
to
the
sacrifice
yet
was
it
a
sacrifice
she
debated
that
question
half
the
night
tossing
from
side
to
side
she
could
not
sleep
and
rising
before
the
dawn
slipped
into
her
dressing
gown
and
went
to
the
window
the
rain
had
ceased
the
clouds
had
broken
and
stood
in
black
bars
against
the
silver
light
of
dawn
she
felt
unaccountably
hungry
and
after
a
second
hesitation
she
opened
the
door
and
went
down
the
broad
stairs
to
the
hall
to
reach
the
kitchen
she
had
to
pass
her
uncle
door
and
she
noticed
that
it
was
ajar
she
thought
possibly
he
had
gone
to
bed
and
left
the
light
on
and
her
hand
was
on
the
knob
to
investigate
when
she
heard
a
voice
and
drew
back
hurriedly
it
was
the
voice
of
jasper
cole
i
have
been
into
the
books
very
carefully
with
mackensen
the
accountant
and
there
seems
no
doubt
he
said
you
think
demanded
her
uncle
i
am
certain
answered
jasper
in
his
even
passionless
tone
the
fraud
has
been
worked
by
frank
he
had
access
to
the
books
he
was
the
only
person
who
saw
rex
holland
he
was
the
only
official
at
the
bank
who
could
possibly
falsify
the
entries
and
at
the
same
time
hide
his
trail
the
girl
turned
cold
and
for
a
moment
swayed
as
though
she
would
faint
she
clutched
the
jamb
of
the
door
for
support
and
waited
i
am
half
inclined
to
your
belief
said
john
minute
slowly
it
is
awful
to
believe
that
frank
is
a
forger
as
his
father
was
awful
it
is
pretty
ghastly
said
jasper
voice
but
it
is
true
the
girl
flung
open
the
door
and
stood
in
the
doorway
it
is
a
lie
she
cried
wrathfully
a
horrible
lie
and
you
know
it
is
a
lie
jasper
without
another
word
she
turned
slamming
the
door
behind
her
chapter
ix
frank
merrill
at
the
altar
frank
merrill
stepped
through
the
swing
doors
of
the
london
and
western
counties
bank
with
a
light
heart
and
a
smile
in
his
eyes
and
went
straight
to
his
chief
office
i
shall
want
you
to
let
me
go
out
this
afternoon
for
an
hour
he
said
brandon
looked
up
wearily
he
had
not
been
without
his
sleepless
moments
and
the
strain
of
the
forgery
and
the
audit
which
followed
was
telling
heavily
upon
him
he
nodded
a
silent
agreement
and
frank
went
back
to
his
desk
humming
a
tune
he
had
every
reason
to
be
happy
for
in
his
pocket
was
the
special
license
which
for
a
consideration
had
been
granted
to
him
and
which
empowered
him
to
marry
the
girl
whose
amazing
telegram
had
arrived
that
morning
while
he
was
at
breakfast
it
had
contained
only
four
words
marry
you
may
he
could
not
guess
what
extraordinary
circumstances
had
induced
her
to
take
so
definite
a
view
but
he
was
a
very
contented
and
happy
young
man
she
was
to
arrive
in
london
soon
after
twelve
and
he
had
arranged
to
meet
her
at
the
station
and
take
her
to
lunch
perhaps
then
she
would
explain
the
reason
for
her
action
he
numbered
among
his
acquaintances
the
rector
of
a
suburban
church
who
had
agreed
to
perform
the
ceremony
and
to
provide
the
necessary
witnesses
it
was
a
beaming
young
man
that
met
the
girl
but
the
smile
left
his
face
when
he
saw
how
wan
and
haggard
she
was
take
me
somewhere
she
said
quickly
are
you
ill
he
asked
anxiously
she
shook
her
head
they
had
the
pall
mall
restaurant
to
themselves
for
it
was
too
early
for
the
regular
lunchers
now
tell
me
dear
he
said
catching
her
hands
over
the
table
to
what
do
i
owe
this
wonderful
decision
i
can
not
tell
you
frank
she
said
breathlessly
i
do
want
to
think
about
it
all
i
know
is
that
people
have
been
beastly
about
you
i
am
going
to
do
all
i
possibly
can
to
make
up
for
it
she
was
a
little
hysterical
and
very
much
overwrought
and
he
decided
not
to
press
the
question
though
her
words
puzzled
him
where
are
you
going
to
stay
he
asked
i
am
staying
at
the
savoy
she
replied
what
am
i
to
do
in
as
few
words
as
possible
he
told
her
where
the
ceremony
was
to
be
performed
and
the
hour
at
which
she
must
leave
the
hotel
we
will
take
the
night
train
for
the
continent
he
said
but
your
work
frank
he
laughed
oh
blow
work
he
cried
hilariously
i
can
not
think
of
work
at
he
was
waiting
in
the
vestry
for
the
girl
arrival
chatting
with
his
friend
the
rector
he
had
arranged
for
the
ceremony
to
be
performed
at
and
the
witnesses
a
glum
verger
and
a
woman
engaged
in
cleaning
the
church
sat
in
the
pews
of
the
empty
building
waiting
to
earn
the
guinea
which
they
had
been
promised
the
conversation
was
about
nothing
in
particular
one
of
those
empty
purposeless
exchanges
of
banal
thought
and
speech
characteristic
of
such
an
occasion
at
frank
looked
at
his
watch
and
walked
out
of
the
church
to
the
end
of
the
road
there
was
no
sign
of
the
girl
at
he
crossed
to
a
providential
tobacconist
and
telephoned
to
the
savoy
and
was
told
that
the
lady
had
left
half
an
hour
before
she
ought
to
be
here
very
soon
he
said
to
the
priest
he
was
a
little
impatient
a
little
nervous
and
terribly
anxious
as
the
church
clock
struck
three
the
rector
turned
to
him
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
marry
you
merrill
he
said
frank
was
very
pale
why
not
he
asked
quickly
miss
nuttall
has
probably
been
detained
by
the
traffic
or
a
burst
tire
she
will
be
here
very
shortly
the
minister
shook
his
head
and
hung
up
his
white
surplice
in
the
cupboard
the
law
of
the
land
my
dear
merrill
he
said
does
not
allow
weddings
after
three
in
the
afternoon
you
can
come
along
morning
any
time
after
eight
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
and
frank
swung
round
it
was
not
the
girl
but
a
telegraph
boy
he
snatched
the
buff
envelope
from
the
lad
hand
and
tore
it
open
it
read
simply
the
wedding
can
not
take
place
it
was
unsigned
at
that
afternoon
may
had
passed
through
the
vestibule
of
the
hotel
and
her
foot
was
on
the
step
of
the
taxicab
when
a
hand
fell
upon
her
arm
and
she
turned
in
alarm
to
meet
the
searching
eyes
of
jasper
cole
where
are
you
off
to
in
such
a
hurry
may
she
flushed
and
drew
her
arm
away
with
a
decisive
gesture
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
jasper
she
said
coldly
after
your
horrible
charge
against
frank
i
never
want
to
speak
to
you
again
he
winced
a
little
then
smiled
at
least
you
can
be
civil
to
an
old
friend
he
said
and
tell
me
where
you
are
off
to
in
such
a
hurry
should
she
tell
him
a
moment
indecision
and
then
she
spoke
i
am
going
to
marry
frank
merrill
she
said
he
nodded
i
thought
as
much
in
that
case
i
am
coming
down
to
the
church
to
make
a
scene
he
said
this
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
but
there
was
no
mistaking
the
resolution
which
showed
in
the
thrust
of
his
square
jaw
what
do
you
mean
she
said
do
be
absurd
jasper
my
mind
is
made
up
i
mean
he
said
quietly
that
i
have
mr
minute
power
of
attorney
to
act
for
him
and
mr
minute
happens
to
be
your
legal
guardian
you
are
in
point
of
fact
my
dear
may
more
or
less
of
a
ward
and
you
can
not
marry
before
you
are
without
your
guardian
consent
i
shall
be
next
week
she
said
defiantly
then
smiled
the
other
wait
till
next
week
before
you
marry
there
is
no
very
pressing
hurry
you
forced
this
situation
upon
me
said
the
girl
hotly
and
i
think
it
is
very
horrid
of
you
i
am
going
to
marry
frank
under
those
circumstances
i
must
come
down
and
forbid
the
marriage
and
when
our
parson
asks
if
there
is
any
just
cause
i
shall
step
forward
to
the
rails
gayly
flourishing
the
power
of
attorney
and
not
even
the
most
hardened
parson
could
continue
in
the
face
of
that
legal
instrument
it
is
a
mandamus
a
caveat
and
all
sorts
of
horrific
things
why
are
you
doing
this
she
asked
because
i
have
no
desire
that
you
shall
marry
a
man
who
is
certainly
a
forger
and
possibly
a
murderer
said
jasper
cole
calmly
i
wo
listen
to
you
she
cried
and
stepped
into
the
waiting
taxicab
without
a
word
jasper
followed
her
you
ca
turn
me
out
he
said
and
i
know
where
you
are
going
anyway
because
you
were
giving
directions
to
the
driver
when
i
stood
behind
you
you
had
better
let
me
go
with
you
i
like
the
suburbs
she
turned
and
faced
him
swiftly
and
silvers
rents
she
asked
he
went
a
shade
paler
what
do
you
know
about
silvers
rents
he
demanded
recovering
himself
with
an
effort
she
did
not
reply
the
taxicab
was
halfway
to
its
destination
before
the
girl
spoke
again
are
you
serious
when
you
say
you
will
forbid
the
marriage
quite
serious
he
replied
so
much
so
that
i
shall
bring
in
a
policeman
to
witness
my
act
the
girl
was
nearly
in
tears
it
is
monstrous
of
you
uncle
would
had
you
not
better
see
your
uncle
he
asked
something
told
her
that
he
would
keep
his
word
she
had
a
horror
of
scenes
and
worst
of
all
she
feared
the
meeting
of
the
two
men
under
these
circumstances
suddenly
she
leaned
forward
and
tapped
the
window
and
the
taxi
slowed
down
tell
him
to
go
back
and
call
at
the
nearest
telegraph
office
i
want
to
send
a
wire
if
it
is
to
frank
merrill
said
jasper
smoothly
you
may
save
yourself
the
trouble
i
have
already
wired
frank
came
back
to
london
in
a
pardonable
fury
he
drove
straight
to
the
hotel
only
to
learn
that
the
girl
had
left
again
with
her
uncle
he
looked
at
his
watch
he
had
still
some
work
to
do
at
the
bank
though
he
had
little
appetite
for
work
yet
it
was
to
the
bank
he
went
he
threw
a
glance
over
the
counter
to
the
table
and
the
chair
where
he
had
sat
for
so
long
and
at
which
he
was
destined
never
to
sit
again
for
as
he
was
passing
behind
the
counter
brandon
met
him
your
uncle
wishes
to
see
you
merrill
he
said
gravely
frank
hesitated
then
walked
into
the
office
closing
the
door
behind
him
and
he
noticed
that
brandon
did
not
attempt
to
follow
john
minute
sat
in
the
one
easy
chair
and
looked
up
heavily
as
frank
entered
sit
down
frank
he
said
i
have
a
lot
of
things
to
ask
you
and
i
one
or
two
things
to
ask
you
uncle
said
frank
calmly
if
it
is
about
may
you
can
save
yourself
the
trouble
said
the
other
if
it
is
about
rex
holland
i
can
give
you
a
little
information
frank
looked
at
him
steadily
i
do
quite
get
your
meaning
sir
he
said
though
i
gather
there
is
something
offensive
behind
what
you
have
said
john
minute
twisted
round
in
the
chair
and
threw
one
leg
over
its
padded
arm
frank
he
said
i
want
you
to
be
perfectly
straight
with
me
and
be
as
perfectly
straight
with
you
the
young
man
made
no
reply
certain
facts
have
been
brought
to
my
attention
which
leave
no
doubt
in
my
mind
as
to
the
identity
of
the
alleged
rex
holland
said
john
minute
slowly
i
do
relish
saying
this
because
i
have
liked
you
frank
though
i
have
sometimes
stood
in
your
way
and
we
have
not
seen
eye
to
eye
together
now
i
want
you
to
come
down
to
eastbourne
and
have
a
talk
with
me
what
do
you
expect
i
can
tell
you
asked
frank
quietly
i
want
you
to
tell
me
the
truth
i
expect
you
wo
said
john
minute
a
half
smile
played
for
a
second
upon
frank
lips
at
any
rate
he
said
you
are
being
straight
with
me
i
do
know
exactly
what
you
are
driving
at
uncle
but
i
gather
that
it
is
something
rather
unpleasant
and
that
somewhere
in
the
background
there
is
hovering
an
accusation
against
me
from
the
fact
that
you
have
mentioned
rex
holland
or
the
gang
which
went
by
that
name
i
suppose
that
you
are
suggesting
that
i
am
an
accomplice
of
that
gentleman
i
suggest
more
than
that
said
the
other
quickly
i
suggest
that
you
are
rex
holland
frank
laughed
aloud
it
is
no
laughing
matter
said
john
minute
sternly
from
your
point
of
view
it
is
not
said
frank
but
from
my
point
of
view
it
has
certain
humorous
aspects
and
unfortunately
i
am
cursed
with
a
sense
of
humor
i
hardly
know
how
i
can
go
into
the
matter
here
he
looked
round
for
even
if
this
is
the
time
it
is
certainly
not
the
place
and
i
think
i
accept
your
invitation
and
come
down
to
weald
lodge
night
i
gather
you
do
want
to
travel
down
with
a
master
criminal
who
might
at
any
moment
take
your
watch
and
chain
i
wish
you
would
look
at
this
matter
more
seriously
frank
said
john
minute
earnestly
i
want
to
get
to
the
truth
and
any
truth
which
exonerates
you
will
be
very
welcome
to
me
frank
nodded
i
will
give
you
credit
for
that
he
said
you
may
expect
me
may
i
ask
you
as
a
personal
favor
that
you
will
not
discuss
this
matter
with
me
in
the
presence
of
your
admirable
secretary
i
have
a
feeling
at
the
back
of
my
mind
that
he
is
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
remember
that
he
is
as
likely
to
know
about
rex
holland
as
i
there
has
been
an
audit
at
the
bank
frank
went
on
and
i
am
not
so
stupid
that
i
do
understand
what
this
has
meant
there
has
also
been
a
certain
coldness
in
the
attitude
of
brandon
and
i
have
intercepted
suspicious
and
meaning
glances
from
the
clerks
i
shall
not
be
surprised
therefore
if
you
tell
me
that
my
books
are
not
in
order
but
again
i
would
point
out
to
you
that
it
is
just
as
possible
for
jasper
who
has
access
to
the
bank
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night
to
have
altered
them
as
it
is
for
me
i
hasten
to
add
he
said
with
a
smile
that
i
do
accuse
jasper
he
is
such
a
machine
and
i
can
not
imagine
him
capable
of
so
much
initiative
as
systematically
to
forge
checks
and
falsify
ledgers
i
merely
mention
jasper
because
i
want
to
emphasize
the
injustice
of
putting
any
man
under
suspicion
unless
you
have
the
strongest
and
most
convincing
proof
of
his
guilt
to
declare
my
innocence
is
unnecessary
from
my
point
of
view
and
probably
from
yours
also
but
i
declare
to
you
uncle
john
that
i
know
no
more
about
this
matter
than
you
he
stood
leaning
on
the
desk
and
looking
down
at
his
uncle
and
john
minute
with
all
his
experience
of
men
and
for
all
his
suspicions
felt
just
a
twinge
of
remorse
it
was
not
to
last
long
however
i
shall
expect
you
he
said
frank
nodded
walked
out
of
the
room
and
out
of
the
bank
and
pairs
of
speculative
eyes
followed
him
a
few
hours
later
another
curious
scene
was
being
enacted
this
time
near
the
town
of
east
grinstead
there
is
a
lonely
stretch
of
road
across
a
heath
which
is
called
for
some
reason
ashdown
forest
a
car
was
drawn
up
on
a
patch
of
turf
by
the
side
of
the
heath
its
owner
was
sitting
in
a
little
clearing
out
of
view
of
the
road
sipping
a
cup
of
tea
which
his
chauffeur
had
made
he
finished
this
and
watched
his
servant
take
the
basket
come
back
to
me
when
you
have
finished
he
said
the
man
touched
his
hat
and
disappeared
with
the
package
but
returned
again
in
a
few
minutes
sit
down
feltham
said
rex
holland
i
dare
say
you
think
it
was
rather
strange
of
me
to
give
you
that
little
commission
the
other
day
said
holland
crossing
his
legs
and
leaning
back
against
a
tree
the
chauffeur
smiled
uncomfortably
yes
sir
i
did
he
said
shortly
were
you
satisfied
with
what
i
gave
you
asked
the
man
the
chauffeur
shuffled
his
feet
uneasily
quite
satisfied
sir
he
said
you
seem
a
little
distrait
feltham
i
mean
a
little
upset
about
something
what
is
it
the
man
coughed
in
embarrassed
confusion
well
sir
he
began
the
fact
is
i
do
like
it
you
do
like
what
the
five
hundred
pounds
i
gave
you
no
sir
it
is
not
that
but
it
was
a
queer
thing
to
ask
me
to
do
pretend
to
be
you
and
send
a
commissionaire
to
the
bank
for
your
money
and
then
get
away
out
of
london
to
a
quiet
little
hole
like
bilstead
so
you
think
it
was
queer
the
chauffeur
nodded
the
fact
is
sir
he
blurted
out
i
seen
the
papers
the
other
nodded
thoughtfully
i
presume
you
mean
the
newspapers
and
what
is
there
in
the
newspapers
that
interests
you
holland
took
a
gold
case
from
his
pocket
opened
it
languidly
and
selected
a
cigarette
he
was
closing
it
when
he
caught
the
eye
and
tossed
a
cigarette
to
him
thank
you
sir
said
the
man
what
was
it
you
did
like
asked
holland
again
passing
a
match
well
sir
i
been
in
all
sorts
of
queer
places
said
feltham
doggedly
as
he
puffed
away
at
the
cigarette
but
i
always
managed
to
keep
clear
of
anything
funny
do
you
see
what
i
mean
by
funny
i
presume
you
do
mean
comic
said
rex
holland
cheerfully
you
mean
dishonest
i
suppose
that
right
sir
and
there
no
doubt
that
i
have
been
in
a
swindle
and
it
worrying
me
that
case
why
i
read
my
own
description
in
the
paper
beads
of
perspiration
stood
upon
the
little
man
forehead
and
there
was
a
pathetic
droop
to
his
mouth
that
is
a
distinction
which
falls
to
few
of
us
said
his
employer
suavely
you
ought
to
feel
highly
honored
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
feltham
the
man
looked
to
left
and
right
as
though
seeking
some
friend
in
need
who
would
step
forth
with
advice
the
only
thing
i
can
do
sir
he
said
is
to
give
myself
up
and
give
me
up
too
said
the
other
with
a
little
laugh
oh
no
my
dear
feltham
listen
i
will
tell
you
something
a
few
weeks
ago
i
had
a
very
promising
valet
chauffeur
just
like
you
he
was
an
admirable
man
and
he
was
also
a
foreigner
i
believe
he
was
a
swede
he
came
to
me
under
exactly
the
same
circumstances
as
you
arrived
and
he
received
exactly
the
same
instructions
as
you
have
received
which
unfortunately
he
did
not
carry
out
to
the
letter
i
caught
him
pilfering
from
me
a
few
trinkets
of
no
great
value
and
instead
of
the
foolish
fellow
repenting
he
blurted
out
the
one
fact
which
i
did
not
wish
him
to
know
and
incidentally
which
i
did
not
wish
anybody
in
the
world
to
know
he
knew
who
i
was
he
had
seen
me
in
the
west
end
and
had
discovered
my
identity
he
even
sought
an
interview
with
some
one
to
whom
it
would
have
been
inconvenient
to
have
made
known
my
character
i
promised
to
find
him
another
job
but
he
had
already
decided
upon
changing
and
had
cut
out
an
advertisement
from
a
newspaper
i
parted
friendly
with
him
wished
him
luck
and
he
went
off
to
interview
his
possible
employer
smoking
one
of
my
cigarettes
just
as
you
are
smoking
and
he
threw
it
away
i
have
no
doubt
just
as
you
have
thrown
it
away
when
it
began
to
taste
a
little
bitter
look
here
said
the
chauffeur
and
scrambled
to
his
feet
if
you
try
any
monkey
tricks
with
me
holland
eyed
him
with
interest
if
you
try
any
monkey
tricks
with
me
said
the
chauffeur
thickly
i
he
pitched
forward
on
his
face
and
lay
still
holland
waited
long
enough
to
search
his
pockets
and
then
stepping
cautiously
into
the
road
donned
the
chauffeur
cap
and
goggles
and
set
his
car
running
swiftly
southward
chapter
x
a
murder
constable
wiseman
lived
in
the
bosom
of
his
admiring
family
in
a
small
cottage
on
the
bexhill
road
that
my
father
was
a
policeman
was
the
proud
boast
of
two
small
boys
a
boast
which
entitled
them
to
no
small
amount
of
respect
because
wiseman
was
not
only
honored
in
his
own
circle
but
throughout
the
village
in
which
he
dwelt
he
was
in
the
first
place
a
town
policeman
as
distinct
from
a
county
policeman
though
he
wore
the
badge
and
uniform
of
the
sussex
constabulary
it
was
felt
that
a
town
policeman
had
more
in
common
with
crime
had
a
vaster
experience
and
was
in
consequence
a
more
helpful
adviser
than
a
man
whose
duties
began
and
ended
in
the
patrolling
of
country
lanes
and
villages
where
nothing
more
exciting
than
an
occasional
dog
fight
or
a
charge
of
poaching
served
to
fill
the
hiatus
of
constabulary
life
constable
wiseman
was
looked
upon
as
a
shrewd
fellow
a
man
to
whom
might
be
brought
the
delicate
problems
which
occasionally
perplexed
and
confused
the
bucolic
mind
he
had
settled
the
vexed
question
as
to
whether
a
policeman
could
or
could
not
enter
a
house
where
a
man
was
beating
his
wife
and
had
decided
that
such
a
trespass
could
only
be
committed
if
the
lady
involved
should
utter
piercing
cries
of
murder
he
added
significantly
that
the
constable
who
was
called
upon
must
be
the
constable
on
duty
and
not
an
ornament
of
the
force
who
by
accident
was
a
resident
in
their
midst
the
problem
of
the
straying
chicken
and
the
egg
that
is
laid
on
alien
property
the
point
of
law
involved
in
the
question
as
to
when
a
servant
should
give
notice
and
the
date
from
which
her
notice
should
count
all
these
matters
came
within
constable
wiseman
purview
and
were
solved
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
who
brought
their
little
obscurities
for
solution
but
it
was
in
his
own
domestic
circle
that
constable
wiseman
appropriately
named
as
all
agreed
shone
with
an
effulgence
that
was
almost
dazzling
and
was
a
source
of
irritation
to
the
male
relatives
on
his
wife
side
one
of
whom
had
unfortunately
come
within
the
grasp
of
the
law
over
a
matter
of
a
snared
rabbit
and
was
in
consequence
predisposed
to
anarchy
in
so
far
as
the
abolition
of
law
and
order
affected
the
police
force
constable
wiseman
sat
at
tea
one
summer
evening
and
about
the
spotless
white
cloth
which
covered
the
table
was
grouped
all
that
constable
wiseman
might
legally
call
his
tea
was
a
function
and
to
the
younger
members
of
the
family
meant
just
tea
and
bread
and
butter
to
constable
wiseman
it
meant
luxuries
of
a
varied
and
costly
nature
his
taste
ranged
from
rump
steak
to
yarmouth
bloaters
and
once
he
had
introduced
a
foreign
delicacy
foreign
to
the
village
which
had
never
known
before
the
reason
for
their
existence
sweetbreads
the
conversation
which
was
well
sustained
by
wiseman
was
usually
of
himself
his
wife
being
content
to
punctuate
his
autobiography
with
such
encouraging
phrases
as
dear
dear
well
whatever
next
the
children
doing
no
more
than
ask
in
a
whisper
for
more
food
this
they
did
at
regular
and
frequent
intervals
but
because
of
their
whispers
they
were
supposed
to
be
unheard
constable
wiseman
spoke
about
himself
because
he
knew
of
nothing
more
interesting
to
talk
about
his
evening
conversation
usually
took
the
form
of
a
very
full
résumé
of
his
previous
day
experience
he
left
the
impression
upon
his
wife
and
glad
enough
she
was
to
have
such
an
impression
that
eastbourne
was
a
town
mainly
as
a
result
of
wiseman
ceaseless
and
tireless
efforts
i
never
had
a
clew
yet
that
i
never
follered
to
the
bitter
end
said
the
preening
constable
you
remember
when
raggett
orchard
was
robbed
who
found
the
thieves
you
did
of
course
i
sure
you
did
said
wiseman
jigging
her
youngest
on
her
knee
the
youngest
not
having
arrived
at
the
age
where
he
recognized
the
necessity
for
expressing
his
desires
in
whispers
who
caught
them
men
after
the
lewes
races
last
year
went
on
constable
wiseman
passionately
who
has
had
more
summonses
for
smoking
chimneys
than
any
other
man
in
the
force
some
people
he
added
as
he
rose
heavily
and
took
down
his
tunic
which
hung
on
the
wall
some
people
would
ask
for
promotion
but
i
perfectly
satisfied
i
not
one
of
those
ambitious
sort
why
i
would
know
at
all
what
to
do
with
myself
if
they
made
me
a
sergeant
you
deserve
it
anyway
said
wiseman
i
do
deserve
anything
i
do
want
said
wiseman
loftily
learned
a
few
things
too
but
i
never
made
use
of
what
come
to
me
officially
to
get
me
pushed
along
you
hear
something
in
a
day
or
two
he
said
mysteriously
and
in
high
life
too
in
a
manner
of
speaking
that
is
if
you
can
call
old
minute
high
life
which
i
very
much
doubt
you
do
say
so
said
wiseman
appropriately
amazed
her
husband
nodded
his
head
there
trouble
up
there
he
said
from
certain
information
received
there
has
been
a
big
row
between
young
merrill
and
the
old
man
and
the
people
have
been
down
about
it
what
more
he
said
i
could
tell
a
thing
or
two
i
seen
that
boy
look
at
the
old
man
as
though
he
like
to
kill
him
you
would
believe
it
would
you
but
i
know
and
it
did
happen
so
long
ago
either
he
was
always
snubbing
him
when
young
merrill
was
down
here
acting
as
his
secretary
and
as
good
as
called
him
a
fool
in
front
of
my
face
when
i
served
him
with
that
summons
for
having
his
lights
up
you
hear
something
one
of
these
days
constable
wiseman
was
an
excellent
prophet
vague
as
his
prophecy
was
he
went
out
of
the
cottage
to
his
duty
in
a
complacent
frame
of
mind
which
was
not
unusual
for
constable
wiseman
was
nothing
if
not
satisfied
with
his
fate
his
complacency
continued
until
a
little
after
seven
that
evening
it
so
happened
that
constable
wiseman
no
less
than
every
other
member
of
the
force
on
duty
that
night
had
much
to
think
about
much
that
was
at
once
exciting
and
absorbing
it
had
been
whispered
before
the
evening
parade
that
sergeant
smith
was
to
leave
the
force
there
was
some
talk
of
his
being
dismissed
but
it
was
clear
that
he
had
been
given
the
opportunity
of
resigning
for
he
was
still
doing
duty
which
would
not
have
been
the
case
had
he
been
forcibly
removed
sergeant
smith
mien
and
attitude
had
confirmed
the
rumor
nobody
was
surprised
since
this
dour
officer
had
been
in
trouble
before
twice
had
he
been
before
the
deputy
chief
constable
for
neglect
of
and
being
drunk
while
on
duty
on
the
earlier
occasions
he
had
had
remarkable
escapes
some
people
talked
of
influence
but
it
is
more
likely
that
the
man
record
had
helped
him
for
he
was
a
policeman
with
a
nose
for
crime
absolutely
fearless
and
had
moreover
assisted
in
the
capture
of
one
or
two
very
desperate
criminals
who
had
made
their
way
to
the
town
his
last
offense
however
was
too
grave
to
overlook
his
inspector
going
the
rounds
had
missed
him
and
after
a
search
he
was
discovered
outside
a
public
house
it
is
no
great
crime
to
be
found
outside
a
public
house
particularly
when
an
officer
has
a
fairly
extensive
area
to
cover
and
in
this
respect
he
was
well
within
the
limits
of
that
area
but
it
must
be
explained
that
the
reason
the
sergeant
was
outside
the
public
house
was
because
he
had
challenged
a
fellow
carouser
to
fight
and
at
the
moment
he
was
discovered
he
was
stripped
to
the
waist
and
setting
about
his
task
with
rare
workmanlike
skill
he
was
also
drunk
to
have
retained
his
services
thereafter
would
have
been
little
less
than
a
crying
scandal
there
is
no
doubt
however
that
sergeant
smith
had
made
a
desperate
attempt
to
use
the
influence
behind
him
and
use
it
to
its
fullest
extent
he
had
had
one
stormy
interview
with
john
minute
and
had
planned
another
constable
wiseman
patrolling
the
london
road
his
mind
filled
with
the
great
news
was
suddenly
confronted
with
the
object
of
his
thoughts
the
sergeant
rode
up
to
where
the
constable
was
standing
in
a
professional
attitude
at
the
corner
of
two
roads
and
jumped
off
with
the
manner
of
a
man
who
has
an
object
in
view
wiseman
he
said
and
his
voice
was
such
as
to
suggest
that
he
had
been
drinking
again
where
will
you
be
at
ten
constable
wiseman
raised
his
eyes
in
thought
at
ten
sergeant
i
shall
be
opposite
the
gates
of
the
cemetery
the
sergeant
looked
round
left
and
right
i
am
going
to
see
mr
minute
on
a
matter
of
business
he
said
and
you
need
mention
the
fact
i
keep
myself
to
myself
began
constable
wiseman
what
i
see
with
one
eye
goes
out
of
the
other
in
the
manner
of
speaking
the
sergeant
nodded
stepped
on
to
his
bicycle
again
turned
it
about
and
went
at
full
speed
down
the
gentle
incline
toward
weald
lodge
he
made
no
secret
of
his
visit
but
rode
through
the
wide
gates
up
the
gravel
drive
to
the
front
of
the
house
rang
the
bell
and
to
the
servant
who
answered
demanded
peremptorily
to
see
mr
minute
john
minute
received
him
in
the
library
where
the
previous
interviews
had
taken
place
minute
waited
until
the
servant
had
gone
and
the
door
was
closed
and
then
he
said
now
crawley
there
no
sense
in
coming
to
me
i
can
do
nothing
for
you
the
sergeant
put
his
helmet
on
the
table
walked
to
a
sideboard
where
a
tray
and
decanter
stood
and
poured
himself
out
a
stiff
dose
of
whisky
without
invitation
john
minute
watched
him
without
any
great
resentment
this
was
not
civilized
eastbourne
they
were
in
they
were
back
in
the
old
days
of
gwelo
where
men
did
not
expect
invitations
to
drink
smith
or
crawley
to
give
him
his
real
name
tossed
down
half
a
tumbler
of
neat
whisky
and
turned
wiping
his
heavy
mustache
with
the
back
of
his
hand
so
you
ca
do
anything
ca
you
he
mimicked
well
i
going
to
show
you
that
you
can
and
that
you
will
he
put
up
his
hand
to
check
the
words
on
john
minute
lips
there
no
sense
in
your
putting
that
rough
stuff
over
me
about
your
being
able
to
send
me
to
jail
because
you
would
do
it
it
suit
your
book
john
minute
to
go
into
the
court
and
testify
against
me
too
many
things
would
come
out
in
the
witness
box
and
you
well
know
it
besides
rhodesia
is
a
long
way
off
i
know
a
place
which
is
so
far
distant
said
the
other
looking
up
from
his
chair
a
place
called
felixstowe
for
example
there
another
place
called
cromer
i
been
in
consultation
with
a
gentleman
you
may
have
heard
of
a
saul
arthur
mann
saul
arthur
mann
repeated
the
other
slowly
i
never
heard
of
him
you
would
not
but
he
has
heard
of
you
said
john
minute
calmly
the
fact
is
crawley
there
a
big
bad
record
against
you
between
your
serious
crimes
in
rhodesia
and
your
blackmail
of
i
a
few
facts
about
you
which
will
interest
you
i
know
the
date
you
came
to
this
country
which
i
did
know
before
and
i
know
how
you
earned
your
living
until
you
found
me
i
know
of
some
shares
in
a
rhodesian
mine
which
you
sold
to
a
gentleman
at
cromer
and
to
a
lady
equally
at
felixstowe
i
not
only
got
the
shares
you
sold
with
your
signature
as
a
director
but
i
have
letters
and
receipts
signed
by
you
it
has
cost
me
a
lot
of
money
to
get
them
but
it
was
well
worth
it
crawley
face
was
livid
he
took
a
step
toward
the
other
but
recoiled
for
at
the
first
hint
of
danger
john
minute
had
pulled
the
revolver
he
invariably
carried
keep
just
where
you
are
crawley
he
said
you
are
close
enough
now
to
be
unpleasant
so
you
got
my
record
have
you
said
the
other
with
an
oath
tucked
away
with
your
marriage
lines
i
bet
and
the
certificate
of
birth
of
the
kids
you
left
to
starve
with
their
mother
get
out
of
here
said
minute
with
dangerous
quiet
get
away
while
you
safe
there
was
something
in
his
eye
which
cowed
the
man
who
turning
with
a
laugh
picked
up
his
helmet
and
walked
from
the
room
the
hour
was
by
constable
wiseman
watch
for
slowly
patrolling
back
he
saw
the
sergeant
come
flying
out
of
the
gateway
on
his
bicycle
and
turn
down
toward
the
town
constable
wiseman
subsequently
explained
that
he
looked
at
his
watch
because
he
had
a
regular
point
at
which
he
should
meet
sergeant
smith
at
and
he
was
wondering
whether
his
superior
would
return
the
chronology
of
the
next
three
hours
has
been
so
often
given
in
various
accounts
of
the
events
which
marked
that
evening
that
i
may
be
excused
if
i
give
them
in
detail
a
car
white
with
dust
turned
into
the
stable
yard
of
the
star
hotel
maidstone
the
driver
in
a
dust
coat
and
a
chauffeur
cap
descended
and
handed
over
the
car
to
a
garage
keeper
with
instructions
to
clean
it
up
and
have
it
filled
ready
for
him
the
following
morning
he
gave
explicit
instructions
as
to
the
number
of
tins
of
petrol
he
required
to
carry
always
and
tipped
the
garage
keeper
handsomely
in
advance
he
was
described
as
a
young
man
with
a
slight
black
mustache
and
he
was
wearing
his
motor
goggles
when
he
went
into
the
office
of
the
hotel
and
ordered
a
bed
and
a
sitting
room
therefore
his
face
was
not
seen
when
his
dinner
was
served
it
was
remarked
by
the
waiter
that
his
goggles
were
still
on
his
face
he
gave
instructions
that
the
whole
of
the
dinner
was
to
be
served
at
once
and
put
upon
the
sideboard
and
that
he
did
not
wish
to
be
disturbed
until
he
rang
the
bell
when
the
bell
rang
the
waiter
came
to
find
the
room
empty
but
from
the
adjoining
room
he
received
orders
to
have
breakfast
by
seven
the
following
morning
at
seven
the
driver
of
the
car
paid
his
bill
his
big
motor
goggles
still
upon
his
face
again
tipped
the
garage
keeper
handsomely
and
drove
his
car
from
the
yard
he
turned
to
the
right
and
appeared
to
be
taking
the
london
road
but
later
in
the
day
as
has
been
established
the
car
was
seen
on
its
way
to
paddock
wood
and
was
later
observed
at
tonbridge
the
driver
pulled
up
at
a
little
tea
house
half
a
mile
from
the
town
ordered
sandwiches
and
tea
which
were
brought
to
him
and
which
he
consumed
in
the
car
late
in
the
afternoon
the
car
was
seen
at
uckfield
and
the
theory
generally
held
was
that
the
driver
was
killing
time
at
the
wayside
cottage
at
which
he
stopped
for
tea
it
was
one
of
those
little
places
that
invite
cyclists
by
an
board
to
tarry
a
while
and
refresh
themselves
he
had
some
conversation
with
the
tenant
of
the
cottage
a
widow
she
seems
to
have
been
the
usual
loquacious
friendly
soul
who
tells
one
without
reserve
her
business
her
troubles
and
a
fair
sprinkling
of
the
news
of
the
day
in
the
shortest
possible
time
i
have
seen
a
paper
said
rex
holland
politely
it
is
a
very
curious
thing
that
i
never
thought
about
newspapers
i
can
get
you
one
said
the
woman
eagerly
you
ought
to
read
about
that
case
the
dead
chauffeur
asked
rex
holland
interestedly
for
that
had
been
the
item
of
general
news
which
was
foremost
in
the
woman
conversation
yes
sir
he
was
murdered
in
ashdown
forest
many
the
time
driven
over
there
how
do
you
know
it
was
a
murder
she
knew
for
many
reasons
her
was
gamekeeper
to
lord
ferring
and
a
colleague
of
his
had
been
the
man
who
had
discovered
the
body
and
it
had
appeared
as
the
good
lady
explained
that
this
same
chauffeur
was
a
man
for
whom
the
police
had
been
searching
in
connection
with
a
bank
robbery
about
which
much
had
appeared
in
the
newspapers
of
the
day
previous
how
very
interesting
said
holland
and
took
the
paper
from
her
hand
he
read
the
description
line
by
line
he
learned
that
the
police
were
in
possession
of
important
clews
and
that
they
were
on
the
track
of
the
man
who
had
been
seen
in
the
company
of
the
chauffeur
moreover
said
a
most
indiscreet
newspaper
writer
the
police
had
a
photograph
showing
the
chauffeur
standing
by
the
side
of
his
car
and
reproductions
of
this
photograph
showing
the
type
of
machine
were
being
circulated
how
very
interesting
said
rex
holland
again
being
perfectly
content
in
his
mind
for
his
search
of
the
body
had
revealed
copies
of
this
identical
picture
and
the
car
in
which
he
was
seated
was
not
the
car
which
had
been
photographed
from
this
point
a
mile
and
a
half
beyond
uckfield
all
trace
of
the
car
and
its
occupant
was
lost
the
writer
has
been
very
careful
to
note
the
exact
times
and
to
confirm
those
about
which
there
was
any
doubt
at
on
the
night
when
constable
wiseman
had
patrolled
the
road
before
weald
lodge
and
had
seen
sergeant
smith
flying
down
the
road
on
his
bicycle
and
on
the
night
of
that
day
when
rex
holland
had
been
seen
at
uckfield
there
arrived
by
the
london
train
which
is
due
at
eastbourne
at
frank
merrill
the
train
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
three
minutes
late
and
frank
who
had
been
in
the
latter
part
of
the
train
was
one
of
the
last
of
the
passengers
to
arrive
at
the
barrier
when
he
reached
the
barrier
he
discovered
that
he
had
no
railway
ticket
a
very
ordinary
and
vexatious
experience
which
travelers
before
now
have
endured
he
searched
in
every
pocket
including
the
pocket
of
the
light
ulster
he
wore
but
without
success
he
was
vexed
but
he
laughed
because
he
had
a
strong
sense
of
humor
i
could
pay
for
my
ticket
he
smiled
but
i
be
hanged
if
i
will
inspector
you
search
that
overcoat
the
amused
inspector
complied
while
frank
again
went
through
all
his
pockets
at
his
request
he
accompanied
the
inspector
to
the
office
and
there
deposited
on
the
table
the
contents
of
his
pockets
his
money
letters
and
pocketbook
you
used
to
searching
people
he
said
see
if
you
can
find
it
i
swear
i
got
it
about
me
somewhere
the
obliging
inspector
felt
probed
but
without
success
till
suddenly
with
a
roar
of
laughter
frank
cried
what
a
stupid
ass
i
am
i
got
it
in
my
hat
he
took
off
his
hat
and
there
in
the
lining
was
a
ticket
from
london
to
eastbourne
it
is
necessary
to
lay
particular
stress
upon
this
incident
which
had
an
important
bearing
upon
subsequent
events
he
called
a
taxicab
drove
to
weald
lodge
and
dismissed
the
driver
in
the
road
he
arrived
at
weald
lodge
by
the
testimony
of
the
driver
and
by
that
of
constable
wiseman
whom
the
car
had
passed
at
about
john
minute
at
this
time
was
alone
his
suspicious
nature
would
not
allow
the
presence
of
servants
in
the
house
during
the
interview
which
he
was
to
have
with
his
nephew
he
regarded
servants
as
spies
and
eavesdroppers
and
perhaps
there
was
an
excuse
for
his
uncharitable
view
at
ten
minutes
after
frank
had
entered
the
gates
of
weald
lodge
a
car
with
gleaming
headlights
came
quickly
from
the
opposite
direction
and
pulled
up
outside
the
gates
wiseman
who
at
this
moment
was
less
than
fifty
yards
from
the
gate
saw
a
man
descend
and
pass
quickly
into
the
grounds
of
the
house
at
or
the
constable
walking
slowly
toward
the
house
came
abreast
of
the
wall
and
looking
up
saw
a
light
flash
for
a
moment
in
one
of
the
upper
windows
he
had
hardly
seen
this
when
he
heard
two
shots
fired
in
rapid
succession
and
a
cry
only
for
a
moment
did
wiseman
hesitate
he
jumped
the
low
wall
pushed
through
the
shrubs
and
made
for
the
side
of
the
house
from
whence
a
flood
of
light
fell
from
the
open
french
windows
of
the
library
he
blundered
into
the
room
a
pace
or
two
and
then
stopped
for
the
sight
was
one
which
might
well
arrest
even
as
unimaginative
a
man
as
a
county
constable
john
minute
lay
on
the
floor
on
his
back
and
it
did
not
need
a
doctor
to
tell
that
he
was
dead
by
his
side
and
almost
within
reach
of
his
hand
was
a
revolver
of
a
very
heavy
army
pattern
mechanically
the
constable
picked
up
the
revolver
and
turned
his
stern
face
to
the
other
occupant
of
the
room
this
is
a
bad
business
merrill
he
found
his
breath
to
say
frank
merrill
had
been
leaning
over
his
uncle
as
the
constable
entered
but
now
stood
erect
pale
but
perfectly
i
heard
the
shot
and
i
came
in
he
said
stay
where
you
are
said
the
constable
and
stepping
quickly
out
on
to
the
lawn
he
blew
his
whistle
long
and
shrilly
then
returned
to
the
room
this
is
a
bad
business
merrill
he
repeated
it
is
a
very
bad
business
said
the
other
in
a
low
voice
is
this
revolver
yours
frank
shook
his
head
i
never
seen
it
before
he
said
with
emphasis
the
constable
thought
as
quickly
as
it
was
humanly
possible
for
him
to
think
he
had
no
doubt
in
his
mind
that
this
unhappy
youth
had
fired
the
shots
which
had
ended
the
life
of
the
man
on
the
floor
stay
here
he
said
again
and
again
went
out
to
blow
his
whistle
he
walked
this
time
on
the
lawn
by
the
side
of
the
drive
toward
the
road
he
had
not
taken
half
a
dozen
steps
when
he
saw
a
dark
figure
of
a
man
creeping
stealthily
along
before
him
in
the
shade
of
the
shrubs
in
a
second
the
constable
was
on
him
had
grasped
him
and
swung
him
round
flashing
his
lantern
into
his
prisoner
face
instantly
he
released
his
hold
i
beg
your
pardon
sergeant
he
stammered
what
the
matter
scowled
the
other
what
wrong
with
you
constable
sergeant
smith
face
was
drawn
and
haggard
the
policeman
looked
at
him
with
astonishment
i
did
know
it
was
you
he
said
what
wrong
asked
the
other
again
and
his
voice
was
cracked
and
unnatural
there
been
a
murder
old
minute
shot
sergeant
smith
staggered
back
a
pace
good
god
he
said
minute
murdered
then
he
did
it
the
young
devil
did
it
come
and
have
a
look
invited
wiseman
recovering
his
balance
got
his
nephew
no
no
i
do
want
to
see
john
minute
dead
you
go
back
i
bring
another
constable
and
a
doctor
he
stumbled
blindly
along
the
drive
into
the
road
and
constable
wiseman
went
back
to
the
house
frank
was
where
he
had
left
him
save
that
he
had
seated
himself
and
was
gazing
steadfastly
upon
the
dead
man
he
looked
up
as
the
policeman
entered
what
have
you
done
he
asked
the
sergeant
gone
for
a
doctor
and
another
constable
said
wiseman
gravely
i
afraid
they
will
be
too
late
said
frank
he
is
what
that
there
was
a
distant
hammering
and
a
faint
voice
calling
for
help
what
that
whispered
frank
again
the
constable
strode
through
the
open
doorway
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
listened
the
sound
came
from
the
upper
story
he
ran
upstairs
mounting
two
at
a
time
and
presently
located
the
noise
it
came
from
an
end
room
and
somebody
was
hammering
on
the
panels
the
door
was
locked
but
the
key
had
been
left
in
the
lock
and
this
constable
wiseman
turned
flooding
the
dark
interior
with
light
come
out
he
said
and
jasper
cole
staggered
out
dazed
and
shaking
somebody
hit
me
on
the
head
with
a
sandbag
he
said
thickly
i
heard
the
shot
what
has
happened
mr
minute
has
been
killed
said
the
policeman
killed
he
fell
back
against
the
wall
his
face
working
killed
he
repeated
not
killed
the
constable
nodded
he
had
found
the
electric
switch
and
the
passageway
was
illuminated
presently
the
young
man
mastered
his
emotion
where
is
he
he
asked
and
wiseman
led
the
way
downstairs
jasper
cole
walked
into
the
room
without
a
glance
at
frank
and
bent
over
the
dead
man
for
a
long
time
he
looked
at
him
earnestly
then
he
turned
to
frank
you
did
this
he
said
i
heard
your
voice
and
the
shots
i
heard
you
threaten
him
frank
said
nothing
he
merely
stared
at
the
other
and
in
his
eyes
was
a
look
of
infinite
scorn
chapter
xi
the
case
against
frank
merrill
saul
arthur
mann
stood
by
the
window
of
his
office
and
moodily
watched
the
traffic
passing
up
and
down
this
busy
city
street
at
what
was
the
busiest
hour
of
the
day
he
stood
there
such
a
long
time
that
the
girl
who
had
sought
his
help
thought
he
must
have
forgotten
her
may
was
pale
and
her
pallor
was
emphasized
by
the
black
dress
she
wore
the
terrible
happening
of
a
week
before
had
left
its
impression
upon
her
for
her
it
had
been
a
week
of
sleepless
nights
a
week
anguish
of
mind
unspeakable
everybody
had
been
most
kind
and
jasper
was
as
gentle
as
a
woman
such
was
the
influence
that
he
exercised
over
her
that
she
did
not
feel
any
sense
of
resentment
against
him
even
though
she
knew
that
he
was
the
principal
witness
for
the
crown
he
was
so
sincere
so
honest
in
his
sympathy
she
told
herself
he
was
so
free
from
any
bitterness
against
the
man
who
he
believed
had
killed
his
best
friend
and
his
most
generous
employer
that
she
could
not
sustain
the
first
feeling
of
resentment
she
had
felt
perhaps
it
was
because
her
great
sorrow
overshadowed
all
other
emotions
yet
she
was
free
to
analyze
her
friendship
with
the
man
who
was
working
day
and
night
to
send
the
man
who
loved
her
to
a
felon
doom
she
could
not
understand
herself
still
less
could
she
understand
jasper
she
looked
up
again
at
mann
as
he
stood
by
the
window
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
and
as
she
did
so
he
turned
slowly
and
came
back
to
where
she
sat
his
usually
jocund
face
was
lugubrious
and
worried
i
have
given
more
thought
to
this
matter
than
i
given
to
any
other
problem
i
have
tackled
he
said
i
believe
merrill
to
be
falsely
accused
and
i
have
one
or
two
points
to
make
to
his
counsel
which
when
they
are
brought
forward
in
court
will
prove
beyond
any
doubt
whatever
that
he
was
innocent
i
do
believe
that
matters
are
so
black
against
him
as
you
think
the
other
side
will
certainly
bring
forward
the
forgery
and
the
doctored
books
to
supply
a
motive
for
the
murder
inspector
nash
is
in
charge
of
the
case
and
he
promised
to
call
here
at
four
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
wants
three
minutes
have
you
any
suggestion
to
offer
she
shook
her
head
i
can
floor
the
prosecution
mann
went
on
but
what
i
can
not
do
is
to
find
the
murderer
for
certain
it
is
obviously
one
of
three
men
it
is
either
sergeant
crawley
alias
smith
about
whose
antecedents
mr
minute
made
an
inquiry
or
jasper
cole
the
secretary
or
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
was
not
necessary
to
say
who
was
the
third
suspect
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
and
the
clerk
announced
inspector
nash
that
stout
and
stoical
officer
gave
a
noncommittal
nod
to
mann
and
a
smiling
recognition
to
the
girl
well
you
know
how
matters
stand
inspector
said
mann
briskly
and
i
thought
i
ask
you
to
come
here
to
straighten
a
few
things
out
it
is
rather
irregular
mann
said
the
inspector
but
as
no
objection
at
headquarters
i
do
mind
telling
you
within
limits
all
that
i
know
but
i
do
suppose
i
can
tell
you
any
more
than
you
have
found
out
for
yourself
do
you
really
think
merrill
committed
this
crime
asked
the
girl
the
inspector
raised
his
eyebrows
and
pursed
his
lips
it
looks
uncommonly
like
it
miss
he
said
we
have
evidence
that
the
bank
has
been
robbed
and
it
is
almost
certainly
proved
that
merrill
had
access
to
the
books
and
was
the
only
person
in
the
bank
who
could
have
faked
the
figures
and
transferred
the
money
from
one
account
to
another
without
being
found
out
there
are
still
one
or
two
doubtful
points
to
be
cleared
up
but
there
is
the
motive
and
when
you
got
the
motive
you
are
three
parts
on
your
way
to
finding
the
criminal
it
is
a
straightforward
case
by
any
means
he
confessed
and
the
more
i
go
into
it
the
more
puzzled
i
am
i
do
mind
telling
you
this
frankly
i
have
seen
constable
wiseman
who
swears
that
at
the
moment
the
shots
were
fired
he
saw
a
light
flash
in
the
upper
window
we
have
the
statement
of
cole
that
he
was
in
his
room
his
employer
having
requested
that
he
should
make
himself
scarce
when
the
nephew
came
and
he
tells
us
how
somebody
opened
the
door
quietly
and
flashed
an
electric
torch
upon
him
what
was
cole
doing
in
the
dark
asked
mann
quickly
he
had
a
headache
and
was
lying
down
said
the
inspector
when
he
saw
the
light
he
jumped
up
and
made
for
it
and
was
immediately
slugged
the
door
closed
upon
him
and
was
locked
between
his
leaving
the
bed
and
reaching
the
door
he
heard
merrill
voice
threatening
his
uncle
and
the
shots
immediately
afterward
he
was
rendered
insensible
a
curious
story
said
saul
arthur
mann
dryly
a
very
curious
story
the
girl
felt
an
unaccountable
and
altogether
amazing
desire
to
defend
jasper
against
the
innuendo
in
the
other
tone
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
she
restrained
herself
i
do
think
it
is
a
good
story
said
the
inspector
frankly
but
that
is
between
ourselves
and
then
of
course
he
went
on
we
have
the
remarkable
behavior
of
sergeant
smith
where
is
he
asked
mann
the
inspector
shrugged
his
shoulders
sergeant
smith
has
disappeared
he
said
though
i
dare
say
we
shall
find
him
before
long
he
is
only
one
the
most
puzzling
element
of
all
is
the
fourth
man
concerned
the
man
who
arrived
in
the
motor
car
and
who
was
evidently
rex
holland
we
have
got
a
very
full
description
of
him
i
also
have
a
very
full
description
of
him
said
mann
quietly
but
i
been
unable
to
identify
him
with
any
of
the
people
in
my
records
anyway
it
was
his
car
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
and
he
was
the
murderer
said
mann
i
no
doubt
about
that
nor
have
you
i
have
doubts
about
everything
replied
the
inspector
diplomatically
what
was
in
the
car
asked
the
little
man
brightly
he
was
rapidly
recovering
his
good
humor
that
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
tell
you
smiled
the
detective
then
i
tell
you
said
saul
arthur
mann
and
stepping
up
to
his
desk
took
a
memorandum
from
a
drawer
there
were
two
motor
rugs
two
holland
coats
one
white
one
brown
there
were
two
sets
of
motor
goggles
there
was
a
package
of
revolver
cartridges
from
which
six
had
been
extracted
a
leather
revolver
holster
a
small
garden
trowel
and
one
or
two
other
little
things
inspector
nash
swore
softly
under
his
breath
i
blessed
if
i
know
how
you
found
all
that
out
he
said
with
a
little
asperity
in
his
voice
the
car
was
not
touched
or
searched
until
we
came
on
the
scene
and
beyond
myself
and
sergeant
mannering
of
my
department
nobody
knows
what
the
car
contained
saul
arthur
mann
smiled
and
it
was
a
very
happy
and
triumphant
smile
you
see
i
know
he
purred
that
is
one
point
in
merrill
favor
yes
agreed
the
detective
and
smiled
why
do
you
smile
mr
nash
asked
the
little
man
suspiciously
i
was
thinking
of
a
county
policeman
who
seems
to
have
some
extraordinary
theories
on
the
subject
oh
you
mean
wiseman
said
mann
with
a
grin
i
interviewed
that
gentleman
there
is
a
great
detective
lost
in
him
inspector
it
is
lost
all
right
said
the
detective
laconically
wiseman
is
very
certain
that
merrill
committed
the
crime
and
i
think
you
are
going
to
have
a
difficulty
in
persuading
a
jury
that
he
did
you
see
merrill
story
is
that
he
came
and
saw
his
uncle
that
they
had
a
few
minutes
chat
together
that
his
uncle
suddenly
had
an
attack
of
faintness
and
that
he
went
out
of
the
room
into
the
dining
room
to
get
a
glass
of
water
while
merrill
was
in
the
dining
room
he
heard
the
shots
and
came
running
back
still
with
the
glass
in
his
hand
and
saw
his
uncle
lying
on
the
ground
i
saw
the
glass
which
was
half
filled
i
was
also
there
in
time
to
examine
the
dining
room
and
see
that
merrill
had
spilled
some
of
the
water
when
he
was
taking
it
from
the
carafe
all
that
part
of
the
story
is
circumstantially
sound
what
we
can
not
understand
and
what
a
jury
will
never
understand
is
how
in
the
very
short
space
of
time
the
murderer
could
have
got
into
the
room
and
made
his
escape
again
the
french
windows
were
open
said
mann
all
the
evidence
that
we
have
is
to
this
effect
including
the
evidence
of
c
wiseman
in
those
circumstances
how
comes
it
that
the
constable
who
when
he
heard
the
shot
made
straight
for
the
room
did
not
meet
the
murderer
escaping
he
saw
nobody
in
the
grounds
except
sergeant
smith
or
crawley
interspersed
saul
arthur
mann
readily
i
have
reason
to
believe
and
indeed
reason
to
know
that
sergeant
smith
or
crawley
had
a
motive
for
being
in
the
house
i
supplied
mr
minute
who
was
a
client
of
mine
with
certain
documents
and
those
documents
were
in
a
safe
in
his
bedroom
what
is
more
likely
than
that
this
crawley
to
whom
it
was
vitally
necessary
that
the
documents
in
question
should
be
recovered
should
have
entered
the
house
in
search
of
those
documents
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
they
related
to
a
fraud
of
which
he
was
the
author
and
they
were
in
themselves
all
the
proof
which
the
police
would
require
to
obtain
a
conviction
against
him
he
was
obviously
the
man
who
struck
down
cole
and
whose
light
the
constable
saw
flashing
in
the
upper
window
in
that
case
he
can
not
have
been
the
murderer
said
the
detective
quickly
because
the
shots
were
fired
while
he
was
still
in
the
room
they
were
almost
simultaneous
with
the
appearance
of
the
flash
at
the
upper
window
h
said
saul
arthur
mann
for
the
moment
nonplussed
the
more
you
go
into
this
matter
the
more
complicated
does
it
become
said
the
police
officer
with
a
shake
of
his
head
and
to
my
mind
the
clearer
is
the
case
against
merrill
with
this
reservation
interrupted
the
other
that
you
have
to
account
for
the
movements
of
rex
holland
who
comes
on
the
scene
ten
minutes
after
frank
merrill
arrives
and
who
leaves
his
car
he
leaves
his
car
for
a
very
excellent
reason
he
went
on
sergeant
smith
who
runs
away
to
get
assistance
meets
two
men
of
the
sussex
constabulary
hurrying
in
response
to
wiseman
whistle
one
of
them
stands
by
the
car
and
the
other
comes
into
the
house
it
was
therefore
impossible
for
the
murderer
to
make
use
of
the
car
here
is
another
point
i
would
have
you
explain
he
had
hoisted
himself
on
the
edge
of
his
desk
and
sat
an
amusing
little
figure
his
legs
swinging
a
foot
from
the
ground
the
revolver
used
was
a
big
webley
not
an
easy
thing
to
carry
or
conceal
about
your
person
and
undoubtedly
brought
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
by
the
man
in
the
car
you
will
say
that
merrill
who
wore
an
overcoat
might
have
easily
brought
it
in
his
pocket
but
the
absolute
proof
that
that
could
not
have
been
the
case
is
that
on
his
arrival
by
train
from
london
merrill
lost
his
ticket
and
very
carefully
searched
himself
a
railway
inspector
assisting
to
discover
the
bit
of
pasteboard
he
turned
out
everything
he
had
in
his
pocket
in
the
inspector
presence
and
his
overcoat
the
only
place
where
he
could
have
concealed
such
a
heavy
weapon
was
searched
by
the
inspector
himself
the
detective
nodded
it
is
a
very
difficult
case
he
agreed
and
one
in
which
i
no
great
heart
for
to
be
absolutely
honest
my
views
are
that
while
it
might
have
been
merrill
the
balance
of
proof
is
that
it
was
not
that
is
of
course
my
unofficial
view
and
i
shall
work
pretty
hard
to
secure
a
conviction
i
am
sure
you
will
said
mann
heartily
must
the
case
go
into
the
court
asked
the
girl
anxiously
there
is
no
other
way
for
it
replied
the
officer
you
see
we
have
arrested
him
and
unless
something
turns
up
the
magistrate
must
commit
him
for
trial
on
the
evidence
we
have
secured
poor
frank
she
said
softly
it
is
rough
on
him
if
he
is
innocent
agreed
nash
but
it
is
lucky
for
him
if
he
guilty
my
experience
of
crime
and
criminals
is
that
it
is
generally
the
obvious
man
who
commits
that
crime
only
once
in
fifty
years
is
he
innocent
whether
he
is
acquitted
or
whether
he
is
found
guilty
he
offered
his
hand
to
mann
i
be
getting
along
now
sir
he
said
the
commissioner
asked
me
to
give
you
all
the
assistance
i
possibly
could
and
i
hope
i
have
done
so
what
are
you
doing
in
the
case
of
jasper
cole
asked
mann
quickly
the
detective
smiled
you
ought
to
know
sir
he
said
and
was
amused
at
his
own
little
joke
well
young
lady
said
mann
turning
to
the
girl
after
the
detective
had
gone
i
think
you
know
how
matters
stand
nash
suspects
cole
jasper
she
said
in
shocked
surprise
jasper
he
repeated
but
that
is
impossible
he
was
locked
in
his
room
that
does
make
it
impossible
i
know
of
fourteen
distinct
cases
of
men
who
committed
crimes
and
were
able
to
lock
themselves
in
their
rooms
leaving
the
key
outside
there
was
a
case
of
henry
burton
coiner
there
was
william
francis
rector
who
killed
a
warder
while
in
prison
and
locked
the
cell
upon
himself
from
the
inside
there
was
but
there
why
should
i
bother
you
with
instances
that
kind
of
trick
is
common
enough
no
he
said
it
is
the
motive
that
we
have
to
find
do
you
still
want
me
to
go
with
you
miss
nuttall
he
asked
i
should
be
very
glad
if
you
would
she
said
earnestly
poor
dear
uncle
i
did
think
i
could
ever
enter
the
house
again
i
can
relieve
your
mind
about
that
he
said
the
will
is
not
to
be
read
in
the
house
mr
minute
lawyers
have
arranged
for
the
reading
at
their
offices
in
lincoln
inn
fields
i
have
the
address
here
somewhere
he
fumbled
in
his
pocket
and
took
out
a
card
power
commons
he
read
lincoln
inn
fields
i
will
meet
you
there
at
three
he
rumpled
his
untidy
hair
with
an
embarrassed
laugh
i
seem
to
have
drifted
into
the
position
of
guardian
to
you
young
lady
he
said
i
ca
say
that
it
is
an
unpleasant
task
although
it
is
a
great
responsibility
you
have
been
splendid
mann
she
said
warmly
and
i
shall
never
forget
all
you
have
done
for
me
somehow
i
feel
that
frank
will
get
off
and
i
hope
i
pray
that
it
will
not
be
at
jasper
expense
he
looked
at
her
in
surprise
and
disappointment
i
thought
he
stopped
you
thought
i
was
engaged
to
frank
and
so
i
am
she
said
with
heightened
color
but
jasper
is
i
hardly
know
how
to
put
it
i
see
said
mann
though
if
the
truth
be
told
he
saw
nothing
which
enlightened
him
punctually
at
three
the
next
afternoon
they
walked
up
the
steps
of
the
lawyers
office
together
jasper
cole
was
already
there
and
to
mann
surprise
so
also
was
inspector
nash
who
explained
his
presence
in
a
few
words
there
may
be
something
in
the
will
which
will
open
a
new
viewpoint
he
said
power
the
solicitor
an
elderly
man
inclined
to
rotundity
was
introduced
and
taking
his
position
before
the
fireplace
opened
the
proceedings
with
an
expression
of
regret
as
to
the
circumstances
which
had
brought
them
together
the
will
of
my
late
client
he
said
was
not
drawn
up
by
me
it
is
written
in
mr
minute
handwriting
and
revokes
the
only
other
will
one
which
was
prepared
some
four
years
ago
and
which
made
provisions
rather
different
to
those
in
the
present
instrument
this
will
he
took
a
single
sheet
of
paper
out
of
an
envelope
was
made
last
year
and
was
witnessed
by
thomas
wellington
crawley
he
adjusted
his
and
examined
the
signature
late
trooper
of
the
matabeleland
mounted
police
and
by
george
warrell
who
was
mr
minute
butler
at
the
time
warrell
died
in
the
eastbourne
hospital
in
the
spring
of
this
year
there
was
a
deep
silence
saul
arthur
mann
face
was
eagerly
thrust
forward
his
head
turned
slightly
to
one
side
inspector
nash
showed
an
unusual
amount
of
interest
both
men
had
the
same
thought
a
new
will
witnessed
by
two
people
one
of
whom
was
dead
and
the
other
a
fugitive
from
justice
what
did
this
will
contain
it
was
the
briefest
of
documents
to
his
ward
he
left
the
sum
of
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
a
provision
which
was
also
made
in
the
previous
will
i
might
add
said
the
lawyer
and
to
this
he
added
all
his
shares
in
the
gwelo
deep
to
his
nephew
francis
merrill
he
left
twenty
thousand
pounds
the
lawyer
paused
and
looked
round
the
little
circle
and
then
continued
the
residue
of
my
property
movable
and
immovable
all
my
furniture
leases
shares
cash
at
bankers
and
all
interests
whatsoever
i
bequeath
to
jasper
cole
who
is
at
present
my
secretary
and
confidential
agent
the
detective
and
saul
arthur
mann
exchanged
glances
and
nash
lips
moved
how
is
that
for
a
he
whispered
chapter
xii
the
trial
of
frank
merrill
the
trial
of
frank
merrill
on
the
charge
that
he
did
on
the
day
of
june
in
the
year
of
our
lord
one
thousand
nine
hundred
wilfully
and
wickedly
kill
and
slay
by
a
pistol
shot
john
minute
was
the
sensation
of
a
season
which
was
unusually
prolific
in
murder
trials
the
trial
took
place
at
the
lewes
assizes
in
a
crowded
courtroom
and
lasted
as
we
know
for
sixteen
days
five
days
of
which
were
given
to
the
examination
in
chief
and
the
of
the
accountants
who
had
gone
into
the
books
of
the
bank
the
prosecution
endeavored
to
establish
the
fact
that
no
other
person
but
frank
merrill
could
have
access
to
the
books
and
that
therefore
no
other
person
could
have
falsified
them
or
manipulated
the
transfer
of
moneys
it
can
not
be
said
that
the
prosecution
had
wholly
succeeded
for
when
brandon
the
bank
manager
was
put
into
the
witness
box
he
was
compelled
to
admit
that
not
only
frank
but
he
himself
and
jasper
cole
were
in
a
position
to
reach
the
books
the
opening
speech
for
the
crown
had
been
a
masterly
one
but
that
there
were
many
weak
points
in
the
evidence
and
in
the
assumptions
which
the
prosecution
drew
was
evident
to
the
merest
tyro
sir
george
murphy
jackson
the
attorney
general
who
prosecuted
attempted
to
dispose
summarily
of
certain
conflictions
and
it
had
to
be
confessed
that
his
explanations
were
very
plausible
the
defense
will
tell
us
he
said
in
that
shrill
clarion
tone
of
his
which
has
made
to
quake
the
hearts
of
so
many
hostile
witnesses
that
we
have
not
accounted
for
the
fourth
man
who
drove
up
in
his
car
ten
minutes
after
merrill
had
entered
the
house
and
disappeared
but
i
am
going
to
tell
you
my
theory
of
that
incident
merrill
had
an
accomplice
who
is
not
in
custody
and
that
accomplice
is
rex
holland
merrill
had
planned
and
prepared
this
murder
because
from
some
statement
which
his
uncle
had
made
he
believed
that
not
only
was
his
whole
future
dependent
upon
destroying
his
benefactor
and
silencing
forever
the
one
man
who
knew
the
extent
of
his
villainy
but
he
had
in
his
cold
shrewd
way
accurately
foreseen
the
exact
consequence
of
such
a
shooting
it
was
a
big
criminal
big
idea
he
foresaw
this
trial
he
said
impressively
he
foresaw
gentlemen
of
the
jury
his
acquittal
at
your
hands
he
foresaw
a
reaction
which
would
not
only
give
him
the
woman
he
professes
to
love
but
in
consequence
place
in
his
hands
the
disposal
of
her
considerable
fortune
why
should
he
shoot
john
minute
you
may
ask
and
i
reply
to
that
question
with
another
what
would
have
happened
had
he
not
shot
his
uncle
he
would
have
been
a
ruined
man
the
doors
of
his
uncle
house
would
have
been
closed
to
him
the
legacy
would
have
been
revoked
the
marriage
for
which
he
had
planned
so
long
would
have
been
an
unrealized
dream
he
knew
the
extent
of
the
fortune
which
was
coming
to
miss
nuttall
mr
minute
made
two
wills
in
both
of
which
he
left
an
identical
sum
to
his
ward
the
first
of
these
revoked
by
the
second
and
containing
the
same
provision
was
witnessed
by
the
man
in
the
dock
he
knew
too
that
the
rhodesian
gold
mine
the
shares
of
which
were
held
by
john
minute
on
the
girl
behalf
was
likely
to
prove
a
very
rich
proposition
and
i
suggest
that
the
information
coming
to
him
as
mr
minute
secretary
he
deliberately
suppressed
that
information
for
his
own
purpose
what
had
he
to
gain
i
ask
you
to
believe
that
if
he
is
acquitted
he
will
have
achieved
all
that
he
ever
hoped
to
achieve
there
was
a
little
murmur
in
the
court
frank
merrill
leaning
on
the
ledge
of
the
dock
looked
down
at
the
girl
in
the
body
of
the
court
and
their
eyes
met
he
saw
the
indignation
in
her
face
and
nodded
with
a
little
smile
then
turned
again
to
the
counsel
with
that
eager
look
of
interest
which
the
girl
had
so
often
seen
upon
his
handsome
face
much
will
be
made
in
the
course
of
this
trial
of
the
presence
of
another
man
and
the
defense
will
endeavor
to
secure
capital
out
of
the
fact
that
the
man
crawley
who
it
was
suggested
was
in
the
house
for
an
improper
purpose
has
not
been
discovered
as
to
the
fourth
man
the
driver
of
the
motor
car
there
seems
little
doubt
but
that
he
was
an
accomplice
of
merrill
this
mysterious
rex
holland
who
has
been
identified
by
totney
of
uckfield
spent
the
whole
of
the
day
wandering
about
sussex
obviously
having
one
plan
in
his
mind
which
was
to
arrive
at
mr
minute
house
at
the
same
time
as
his
confederate
you
will
have
the
evidence
that
when
merrill
stepped
down
after
being
driven
from
the
station
he
looked
left
and
right
as
though
he
were
expecting
somebody
the
plan
to
some
extent
miscarried
the
accomplice
arrived
ten
minutes
too
late
on
some
pretext
or
other
merrill
probably
left
the
room
i
suggest
that
he
did
not
go
into
the
dining
room
but
that
he
went
out
into
the
garden
and
was
met
by
his
accomplice
who
handed
him
the
weapon
with
which
this
crime
was
committed
it
may
be
asked
by
the
defense
why
the
accomplice
who
was
presumably
rex
holland
did
not
himself
commit
the
crime
i
could
offer
two
or
three
alternative
suggestions
all
of
which
are
feasible
the
deceased
man
was
shot
at
close
quarters
and
was
found
in
such
an
attitude
as
to
suggest
that
he
was
wholly
unprepared
for
the
attack
we
know
that
he
was
in
some
fear
and
that
he
invariably
went
armed
yet
it
is
fairly
certain
that
he
made
no
attempt
to
draw
his
weapon
which
he
certainly
would
have
done
had
he
been
suddenly
confronted
by
an
armed
stranger
i
do
not
pretend
that
i
am
explaining
the
strange
relationship
between
merrill
and
this
mysterious
forger
merrill
is
the
only
man
who
has
seen
him
and
has
given
a
vague
and
somewhat
confused
description
of
him
was
a
man
with
a
short
beard
is
merrill
description
the
woman
who
served
him
with
tea
near
uckfield
describes
him
as
a
man
with
a
dark
mustache
but
otherwise
clean
shaven
there
is
no
reason
of
course
why
he
should
not
have
removed
his
beard
but
as
against
that
suggestion
we
will
call
evidence
to
prove
that
the
man
seen
driving
with
the
murdered
chauffeur
was
invariably
a
man
with
a
mustache
and
no
beard
so
that
the
balance
of
probability
is
on
the
side
of
the
supposition
that
merrill
is
not
telling
the
truth
an
unknown
client
with
a
large
deposit
at
his
bank
would
not
be
likely
constantly
to
alter
his
appearance
if
he
were
a
criminal
as
we
know
him
to
be
there
would
be
another
reason
why
he
should
not
excite
suspicion
in
this
way
his
address
covered
the
greater
part
of
a
day
but
he
returned
to
the
scene
in
the
garden
to
the
supposed
meeting
of
the
two
men
and
to
the
murder
saul
arthur
mann
sitting
with
frank
solicitor
scratched
his
nose
and
grinned
i
have
never
heard
a
more
ingenious
piece
of
reconstruction
he
said
though
of
course
the
whole
thing
is
palpably
absurd
as
a
theory
it
was
no
doubt
excellent
but
men
are
not
sentenced
to
death
on
theories
however
ingenious
they
may
be
probably
nobody
in
the
court
so
completely
admired
the
ingenuity
as
the
man
most
affected
at
the
lunch
interval
on
the
day
on
which
this
theory
was
put
forward
he
met
his
solicitor
and
saul
arthur
mann
in
the
bare
room
in
which
such
interviews
are
permitted
it
was
really
fascinating
to
hear
him
said
frank
as
he
sipped
the
cup
of
tea
which
they
had
brought
him
i
almost
began
to
believe
that
i
had
committed
the
murder
but
is
it
rather
alarming
will
the
jury
take
the
same
view
he
asked
a
little
troubled
the
solicitor
shook
his
head
unsupported
theories
of
that
sort
do
not
go
well
with
juries
and
of
course
the
whole
story
is
so
flimsy
and
so
improbable
that
it
will
go
for
no
more
than
a
piece
of
clever
reasoning
did
anybody
see
you
at
the
railway
station
frank
shook
his
head
i
suppose
hundreds
of
people
saw
me
but
would
hardly
remember
me
was
there
any
one
on
the
train
who
knew
you
no
said
frank
after
a
moment
thought
there
were
six
people
in
my
carriage
until
we
got
to
lewes
but
i
think
i
told
you
that
and
you
have
not
succeeded
in
tracing
any
of
them
it
is
most
difficult
to
get
into
touch
with
those
people
said
the
lawyer
think
of
the
scores
of
people
one
travels
with
without
ever
remembering
what
they
looked
like
or
how
they
were
dressed
if
you
had
been
a
woman
traveling
with
women
every
one
of
your
five
fellow
passengers
would
have
remembered
you
and
would
have
recalled
your
hat
frank
laughed
there
are
certain
disadvantages
in
being
a
man
he
said
how
do
you
think
the
case
is
going
they
have
offered
no
evidence
yet
i
think
you
will
agree
mann
he
said
respectfully
for
saul
arthur
mann
was
a
power
in
legal
circles
none
at
all
the
little
fellow
agreed
frank
recalled
the
first
day
he
had
seen
him
with
his
hat
perched
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
his
shabby
genteel
exterior
oh
by
jove
he
said
i
suppose
they
will
be
trying
to
fasten
the
death
of
that
man
upon
me
that
we
saw
in
gray
square
saul
arthur
mann
nodded
they
have
not
put
that
in
the
indictment
he
said
nor
the
case
of
the
chauffeur
you
see
your
conviction
will
rest
entirely
upon
this
present
charge
and
both
the
other
matters
are
subsidiary
frank
walked
thoughtfully
up
and
down
the
room
his
hands
behind
his
back
i
wonder
who
rex
holland
is
he
said
half
to
himself
you
still
have
your
theory
asked
the
lawyer
eying
him
keenly
frank
nodded
and
you
still
would
rather
not
put
it
into
words
much
rather
not
said
frank
gravely
he
returned
to
the
court
and
glanced
round
for
the
girl
but
she
was
not
there
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
proceedings
taken
up
as
they
were
with
the
preliminaries
of
the
case
bored
him
it
was
on
the
twelfth
day
of
the
trial
that
jasper
cole
stepped
on
to
the
witness
stand
he
was
dressed
in
black
and
was
paler
than
usual
but
he
took
the
oath
in
a
firm
voice
and
answered
the
questions
which
were
put
to
him
without
hesitation
the
story
of
frank
quarrel
with
his
uncle
of
the
forged
checks
and
of
his
own
experience
on
the
night
of
the
crime
filled
the
greater
part
of
the
forenoon
and
it
was
in
the
afternoon
when
bryan
bennett
one
of
the
most
brilliant
barristers
of
his
time
stood
up
to
had
you
any
suspicion
that
your
employer
was
being
robbed
i
had
a
suspicion
replied
jasper
did
you
communicate
your
suspicion
to
your
employer
jasper
hesitated
no
he
replied
at
last
why
do
you
hesitate
asked
bennett
sharply
because
although
i
did
not
directly
communicate
my
suspicions
i
hinted
to
mr
minute
that
he
should
have
an
independent
audit
so
you
thought
the
books
were
wrong
i
did
in
these
circumstances
asked
bennett
slowly
do
you
not
think
it
was
very
unwise
of
you
to
touch
those
books
yourself
when
did
i
touch
them
asked
jasper
quickly
i
suggest
that
on
a
certain
night
you
came
to
the
bank
and
remained
in
the
bank
by
yourself
examining
the
ledgers
on
behalf
of
your
employer
and
that
during
that
time
you
handled
at
least
three
books
in
which
these
falsifications
were
made
that
is
quite
correct
said
jasper
after
a
moment
thought
but
my
suspicions
were
general
and
did
not
apply
to
any
particular
group
of
books
but
did
you
not
think
it
was
dangerous
again
the
hesitation
it
may
have
been
foolish
and
if
i
had
known
how
matters
were
developing
i
should
certainly
not
have
touched
them
you
do
admit
that
there
were
several
periods
of
time
from
seven
in
the
evening
until
nine
and
from
until
when
you
were
absolutely
alone
in
the
bank
that
is
true
said
jasper
and
during
those
periods
you
could
had
you
wished
and
had
you
been
a
forger
for
example
or
had
you
any
reason
for
falsifying
the
entries
have
made
those
falsifications
i
admit
there
was
time
said
jasper
would
you
describe
yourself
as
a
friend
of
frank
merrill
not
a
close
friend
replied
jasper
did
you
like
him
i
can
not
say
that
i
was
fond
of
him
was
the
reply
he
was
a
rival
of
yours
in
what
respect
counsel
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
was
very
fond
of
miss
nuttall
yes
and
she
was
fond
of
him
yes
did
you
not
aspire
to
pay
your
addresses
to
miss
nuttall
jasper
cole
looked
down
to
the
girl
and
may
averted
her
eyes
her
cheeks
were
burning
and
she
had
a
wild
desire
to
flee
from
the
court
if
you
mean
did
i
love
miss
nuttall
said
jasper
cole
in
his
quiet
even
tone
i
reply
that
i
did
you
even
secured
the
active
support
of
mr
minute
i
never
urged
the
matter
with
mr
minute
said
jasper
so
that
if
he
moved
on
your
behalf
he
did
so
without
your
knowledge
without
my
corrected
the
witness
he
told
me
afterward
that
he
had
spoken
to
miss
nuttall
and
i
was
considerably
embarrassed
i
understand
you
were
a
man
of
curious
habits
mr
cole
we
are
all
people
of
curious
habits
smiled
the
witness
but
you
in
particular
you
were
an
orientalist
i
believe
i
have
studied
oriental
languages
and
customs
said
jasper
shortly
have
you
ever
extended
your
study
to
the
realm
of
hypnotism
i
have
replied
the
witness
have
you
ever
made
experiments
on
animals
yes
on
human
beings
no
i
have
never
made
experiments
on
human
beings
have
you
also
made
a
study
of
narcotics
the
lawyer
leaned
forward
over
the
table
and
looked
at
the
witness
between
eyes
i
have
made
experiments
with
narcotic
herbs
and
plants
said
jasper
after
a
moment
hesitation
i
think
you
should
know
that
the
career
which
was
planned
for
me
was
that
of
a
doctor
and
i
have
always
been
very
interested
in
the
effects
of
narcotics
you
know
of
a
drug
called
asked
the
counsel
consulting
his
paper
yes
it
is
hemp
is
there
an
infusion
of
to
be
obtained
i
do
not
think
there
is
said
the
other
i
can
probably
enlighten
you
because
i
see
now
the
trend
of
your
examination
i
once
told
frank
merrill
many
years
ago
when
i
was
very
enthusiastic
that
an
infusion
of
combined
with
tincture
of
opium
and
hyocine
produced
certain
effects
it
is
inclined
to
sap
the
will
power
of
a
man
or
a
woman
who
is
constantly
absorbing
this
poison
in
small
doses
suggested
the
counsel
that
is
so
the
counsel
now
switched
off
on
a
new
tack
do
you
know
the
east
of
london
yes
slightly
do
you
know
silvers
rents
yes
do
you
ever
go
to
silvers
rents
yes
i
go
there
very
regularly
the
readiness
of
the
reply
astonished
both
frank
and
the
girl
she
had
been
feeling
more
and
more
uncomfortable
as
the
continued
and
had
a
feeling
that
she
had
in
some
way
betrayed
jasper
cole
confidence
she
had
listened
to
the
which
revealed
jasper
as
a
scientist
with
something
approaching
amazement
she
had
known
of
the
laboratory
but
had
associated
the
place
with
those
entertaining
experiments
that
an
idle
dabbler
in
chemistry
might
undertake
for
a
moment
she
doubted
and
searched
her
mind
for
some
occasion
when
he
had
practiced
his
medical
knowledge
dimly
she
realized
that
there
been
some
such
occasion
and
then
she
remembered
that
it
had
always
been
jasper
cole
who
had
concocted
the
strange
drafts
which
had
so
relieved
the
headache
to
which
when
she
was
a
little
younger
she
had
been
something
of
a
martyr
could
he
she
struggled
hard
to
dismiss
the
thought
as
being
unworthy
of
her
and
now
when
the
object
of
his
visits
to
silvers
rents
was
under
examination
she
found
her
curiosity
growing
why
did
you
go
to
silvers
rents
there
was
no
answer
i
will
repeat
my
question
with
what
object
did
you
go
to
silvers
rents
i
decline
to
answer
that
question
said
the
man
in
the
box
coolly
i
merely
tell
you
that
i
went
there
frequently
and
you
refuse
to
say
why
i
refuse
to
say
why
repeated
the
witness
the
judge
on
the
bench
made
a
little
note
i
put
it
to
you
said
counsel
speaking
impressively
that
it
was
in
silvers
rents
that
you
took
on
another
identity
that
is
probably
true
said
the
other
and
the
girl
gasped
he
was
so
cool
so
so
sure
of
himself
i
suggest
to
you
the
counsel
went
on
that
in
those
rents
jasper
cole
became
rex
holland
there
was
a
buzz
of
excitement
a
sudden
soft
clamor
of
voices
through
which
the
usher
harsh
demand
for
silence
cut
like
a
knife
your
suggestion
is
an
absurd
one
said
jasper
without
heat
and
i
presume
that
you
are
going
to
produce
evidence
to
support
so
infamous
a
statement
what
evidence
i
produce
said
counsel
with
asperity
is
a
matter
for
me
to
decide
it
is
also
a
matter
for
the
witness
interposed
the
soft
voice
of
the
judge
as
you
have
suggested
that
holland
was
a
party
to
the
murder
and
as
you
are
inferring
that
rex
holland
is
jasper
cole
it
is
presumed
that
you
will
call
evidence
to
support
so
serious
a
charge
i
am
not
prepared
to
call
evidence
my
lord
and
if
your
lordship
thinks
the
question
should
not
have
been
put
i
am
willing
to
withdraw
it
the
judge
nodded
and
turned
his
head
to
the
jury
you
will
consider
that
question
as
not
having
been
put
gentlemen
he
said
doubtless
counsel
is
trying
to
establish
the
fact
that
one
person
might
just
as
easily
have
been
rex
holland
as
another
there
is
no
suggestion
that
cole
went
to
silvers
rents
which
i
understand
is
in
a
very
poor
neighborhood
with
any
illegal
intent
or
that
he
was
committing
any
crime
or
behaving
in
any
way
improperly
by
paying
such
frequent
visits
there
may
be
something
in
the
witness
life
associated
with
that
poor
house
which
has
no
bearing
on
the
case
and
which
he
does
not
desire
should
be
ventilated
in
this
court
it
happens
to
many
of
us
the
judge
went
on
that
we
have
associations
which
it
would
embarrass
us
to
reveal
this
little
incident
closed
that
portion
of
the
and
counsel
went
on
to
the
night
of
the
murder
when
did
you
come
to
the
house
he
asked
i
came
to
the
house
soon
after
dark
had
you
been
in
london
yes
i
walked
from
bexhill
it
was
dark
when
you
arrived
yes
nearly
dark
the
servants
had
all
gone
out
yes
was
mr
minute
pleased
to
see
you
yes
he
had
expected
me
earlier
in
the
day
did
he
tell
you
that
his
nephew
was
coming
to
see
him
i
knew
that
you
say
he
suggested
that
you
should
make
yourself
scarce
yes
and
as
you
had
a
headache
you
went
upstairs
and
lay
down
on
your
bed
yes
what
were
you
doing
in
bexhill
i
came
down
from
town
and
got
into
the
wrong
portion
of
the
train
a
junior
leaned
over
and
whispered
quickly
to
his
leader
i
see
i
see
said
the
counsel
petulantly
your
ticket
was
found
at
bexhill
have
you
ever
seen
rex
holland
he
asked
never
you
have
never
met
any
person
of
that
name
never
in
this
tame
way
the
closed
as
have
a
habit
of
doing
by
the
time
the
final
addresses
of
counsel
had
ended
and
the
judge
had
finished
a
masterly
there
was
no
doubt
whatever
in
the
mind
of
any
person
in
the
court
as
to
what
the
verdict
would
be
the
jury
was
absent
from
the
box
for
twenty
minutes
and
returned
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
the
judge
discharged
frank
merrill
without
comment
and
he
left
the
court
a
free
but
ruined
man
chapter
xiii
the
man
who
came
to
montreux
it
was
two
months
after
the
great
trial
on
a
warm
day
in
october
when
frank
merrill
stepped
ashore
from
the
big
white
paddle
boat
which
had
carried
him
across
lake
leman
from
lausanne
and
handing
his
bag
to
a
porter
made
his
way
to
the
hotel
omnibus
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
pointed
to
a
quarter
to
four
and
may
was
not
due
to
arrive
until
half
past
he
went
to
his
hotel
washed
and
changed
and
came
down
to
the
vestibule
to
inquire
if
the
instructions
he
had
telegraphed
had
been
carried
out
may
was
arriving
in
company
with
saul
arthur
mann
who
was
taking
one
of
his
rare
holidays
abroad
frank
had
only
seen
the
girl
once
since
the
day
of
the
trial
he
had
come
to
breakfast
on
the
following
morning
and
very
little
had
been
said
he
was
due
to
leave
that
afternoon
for
the
continent
he
had
a
little
money
sufficient
for
his
needs
and
jasper
cole
had
offered
no
suggestion
that
he
would
dispute
the
will
in
so
far
as
it
affected
frank
so
he
had
gone
abroad
and
had
idled
away
two
months
in
france
spain
and
italy
and
had
then
made
his
leisurely
way
back
to
switzerland
by
way
of
maggiore
he
had
grown
a
little
graver
was
a
little
more
set
in
his
movements
but
he
bore
upon
his
face
no
mark
to
indicate
the
mental
agony
through
which
he
must
have
passed
in
that
and
wearisome
trial
so
thought
the
girl
as
she
came
through
the
swing
doors
of
the
hotel
passed
the
obsequious
hotel
servants
and
greeted
him
in
the
big
palm
court
if
she
saw
any
change
in
him
he
remarked
a
development
in
her
which
was
a
little
short
of
wonderful
she
was
at
that
age
when
the
woman
is
breaking
through
the
beautiful
chrysalis
of
girlhood
in
those
two
months
a
remarkable
change
had
come
over
her
a
change
which
he
could
not
for
the
moment
define
for
this
phenomenon
of
development
had
been
denied
to
his
experience
why
may
he
said
you
are
quite
old
she
laughed
and
again
he
noticed
the
change
the
laugh
was
richer
sweeter
purer
than
the
bubbling
treble
he
had
known
you
are
not
getting
complimentary
are
you
she
asked
she
was
exquisitely
dressed
and
had
that
poise
which
few
englishwomen
achieve
she
had
the
art
of
wearing
clothes
and
from
the
flimsy
crest
of
her
toque
to
the
tips
of
her
little
feet
she
was
all
that
the
most
exacting
critic
could
desire
there
are
women
who
are
no
more
than
mannequins
there
are
fine
ladies
who
can
not
be
mistaken
for
anything
but
fine
ladies
whose
dresses
are
a
horror
and
an
abomination
and
whose
expressed
tastes
are
execrable
may
nuttall
was
a
fine
lady
finely
appareled
when
you
have
finished
admiring
me
frank
she
said
tell
us
what
you
have
been
doing
but
first
of
all
let
us
have
some
tea
you
know
mr
mann
the
little
investigator
beaming
in
the
background
took
frank
hand
and
shook
it
heartily
he
was
dressed
in
what
he
thought
was
an
appropriate
costume
for
a
mountainous
country
his
boots
were
stout
the
woolen
stockings
which
covered
his
very
thin
legs
were
very
woolen
and
his
knickerbocker
suit
was
warranted
to
stand
wear
and
tear
he
had
abandoned
his
top
hat
for
a
large
golf
cap
which
was
perched
rakishly
over
one
eye
frank
looked
round
apprehensively
for
saul
alpenstock
and
was
relieved
when
he
failed
to
discover
one
the
girl
threw
off
her
fur
wrap
and
unbuttoned
her
gloves
as
the
waiter
placed
the
big
silver
tray
on
the
table
before
her
i
afraid
i
have
not
much
to
tell
said
frank
in
answer
to
her
question
i
just
been
loafing
around
what
is
your
news
what
is
my
news
she
asked
i
do
think
i
have
any
except
that
everything
is
going
very
smoothly
in
england
and
oh
frank
i
am
so
immensely
rich
he
smiled
the
appropriate
thing
would
be
to
say
that
i
am
immensely
poor
he
said
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
am
not
i
went
down
to
aix
and
won
quite
a
lot
of
money
won
it
she
said
he
nodded
with
an
amused
little
smile
you
would
have
thought
i
was
a
gambler
would
you
he
asked
solemnly
i
do
think
i
am
as
a
matter
of
fact
but
somehow
i
wanted
to
occupy
my
mind
i
understand
she
said
quickly
another
little
pause
while
she
poured
out
the
tea
which
afforded
saul
arthur
mann
an
opportunity
of
firing
off
fifty
facts
about
geneva
in
as
many
sentences
what
has
happened
to
jasper
asked
frank
after
a
while
the
girl
flushed
a
little
oh
jasper
she
said
awkwardly
i
see
him
you
know
he
has
become
more
mysterious
than
ever
quite
like
one
of
those
wicked
people
one
reads
about
in
sensational
stories
he
has
a
laboratory
somewhere
in
the
country
and
he
does
quite
a
lot
of
motoring
i
seen
him
several
times
at
brighton
for
instance
frank
nodded
slowly
i
should
think
that
he
was
a
good
driver
he
said
saul
arthur
mann
looked
up
and
met
his
eye
with
a
smile
which
was
lost
upon
the
girl
he
has
been
kind
to
me
she
said
hesitatingly
does
he
ever
speak
about
she
shook
her
head
i
do
want
to
think
about
that
she
said
please
do
let
us
talk
about
it
he
knew
she
was
referring
to
john
minute
death
and
changed
the
conversation
a
few
minutes
later
he
had
an
opportunity
of
speaking
with
mann
what
is
the
news
he
asked
saul
arthur
mann
looked
round
i
think
we
are
getting
near
the
truth
he
said
dropping
his
voice
one
of
my
men
has
had
him
under
observation
ever
since
the
day
of
the
trial
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
is
really
a
brilliant
chemist
have
you
a
theory
i
have
several
said
mann
i
am
perfectly
satisfied
that
the
unfortunate
fellow
we
saw
together
on
the
occasion
of
our
first
meeting
was
rex
holland
servant
i
was
as
certain
that
he
was
poisoned
by
a
very
powerful
poisoning
when
your
trial
was
on
the
body
was
exhumed
and
examined
and
the
presence
of
that
drug
was
discovered
it
was
the
same
as
that
employed
in
the
case
of
the
chauffeur
obviously
rex
holland
is
a
clever
chemist
i
wanted
to
see
you
about
that
he
said
at
the
trial
that
he
had
discussed
such
matters
with
you
frank
nodded
we
used
to
have
quite
long
talks
about
drugs
he
said
i
have
recalled
many
of
those
conversations
since
the
day
of
the
trial
he
even
fired
me
with
his
enthusiasm
and
i
used
to
assist
him
in
his
little
experiments
and
obtained
quite
a
working
knowledge
of
these
particular
elements
unfortunately
i
can
not
remember
very
much
for
my
enthusiasm
soon
died
and
beyond
the
fact
that
he
employed
hyocine
and
indian
hemp
i
have
only
the
dimmest
recollection
of
any
of
the
constituents
he
employed
saul
arthur
nodded
energetically
i
shall
have
more
to
tell
you
later
perhaps
he
said
but
at
present
my
inquiries
are
shaping
quite
nicely
he
is
going
to
be
a
difficult
man
to
catch
because
if
all
i
believe
is
true
he
is
one
of
the
most
and
calculating
men
it
has
ever
been
my
lot
to
meet
and
i
have
met
a
few
he
added
grimly
when
he
said
men
frank
knew
that
he
had
meant
criminals
we
are
probably
doing
him
a
horrible
injustice
he
smiled
poor
old
jasper
you
are
not
cut
out
for
police
work
snapped
saul
arthur
mann
you
too
many
sympathies
i
do
exactly
sympathize
rejoined
frank
but
i
just
pity
him
in
a
way
again
mann
looked
round
cautiously
and
again
lowered
his
voice
which
had
risen
there
is
one
thing
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
it
is
rather
a
delicate
matter
merrill
he
said
fire
ahead
it
is
about
miss
nuttall
she
has
seen
a
lot
of
our
friend
jasper
and
after
every
interview
she
seems
to
grow
more
and
more
reliant
upon
his
help
once
or
twice
she
has
been
embarrassed
when
i
have
spoken
about
jasper
cole
and
has
changed
the
subject
frank
pursed
his
lips
thoughtfully
and
a
hard
little
look
came
into
his
eyes
which
did
not
promise
well
for
jasper
so
that
is
it
he
said
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
if
she
cares
for
him
it
is
not
my
business
but
it
is
your
business
said
the
other
sharply
she
was
fond
enough
of
you
to
offer
to
marry
you
further
talk
was
cut
short
by
the
arrival
of
the
girl
their
meeting
at
geneva
had
been
to
some
extent
a
chance
one
she
was
going
through
to
chamonix
to
spend
the
winter
and
saul
arthur
mann
seized
the
opportunity
of
taking
a
short
and
pleasant
holiday
hearing
that
frank
was
in
switzerland
she
had
telegraphed
him
to
meet
her
are
you
staying
any
time
in
switzerland
she
asked
him
as
they
strolled
along
the
beautiful
quay
i
am
going
back
to
london
he
replied
she
said
in
surprise
he
nodded
but
i
am
staying
here
for
two
or
three
days
she
protested
i
intended
also
staying
for
two
or
three
days
he
smiled
but
my
business
will
not
wait
nevertheless
she
persuaded
him
to
stay
till
the
morrow
they
were
at
breakfast
when
the
morning
mail
was
delivered
and
frank
noted
that
she
went
rapidly
through
the
dozen
letters
which
came
to
her
and
she
chose
one
for
first
reading
he
could
not
help
but
see
that
that
bore
an
english
stamp
and
his
long
acquaintance
with
the
curious
calligraphy
of
jasper
cole
left
him
in
no
doubt
as
to
who
was
the
correspondent
he
saw
with
what
eagerness
she
read
the
letter
the
little
look
of
disappointment
when
she
turned
to
an
inside
sheet
and
found
that
it
had
not
been
filled
and
his
mind
was
made
up
he
had
a
post
also
which
he
examined
with
some
evidence
of
impatience
your
mail
is
not
so
nice
as
mine
said
the
girl
with
a
smile
it
is
not
nice
at
all
he
grumbled
the
one
thing
i
wanted
and
to
be
very
truthful
may
the
one
inducement
to
stay
over
the
night
she
added
was
what
i
have
been
trying
to
buy
a
house
on
the
lake
he
said
and
the
infernal
agent
at
lausanne
promised
to
write
telling
me
whether
my
terms
had
been
agreed
to
by
his
client
he
looked
down
at
the
table
and
frowned
saul
arthur
mann
had
a
great
and
extensive
knowledge
of
human
nature
he
had
remarked
the
disappointment
on
frank
face
having
identified
also
the
correspondent
whose
letter
claimed
priority
of
attention
he
knew
that
frank
anger
with
the
house
agent
was
very
likely
the
expression
of
his
anger
in
quite
another
direction
can
i
send
the
letter
on
suggested
the
girl
that
wo
help
me
said
frank
with
a
little
grimace
i
wanted
to
settle
the
business
this
week
i
have
it
she
said
i
will
open
the
letter
and
telegraph
to
you
in
paris
whether
the
terms
are
accepted
or
not
frank
laughed
it
hardly
seems
worth
that
he
said
but
i
should
take
it
as
awfully
kind
of
you
if
you
would
may
saul
arthur
mann
believed
in
his
mind
that
frank
did
not
care
tuppence
whether
the
agent
accepted
the
terms
or
not
but
that
he
had
taken
this
as
a
opportunity
for
veiling
his
annoyance
you
have
had
quite
a
large
mail
miss
nuttall
he
said
i
only
opened
one
though
it
is
from
jasper
she
said
hurriedly
again
both
men
noticed
the
faint
flush
the
strange
unusual
light
which
came
to
her
eyes
and
where
does
jasper
write
from
asked
frank
steadying
his
voice
he
writes
from
england
but
he
was
going
on
the
continent
to
holland
the
day
he
wrote
she
said
it
is
funny
to
think
that
he
is
here
in
switzerland
asked
frank
in
surprise
do
be
silly
she
laughed
no
i
mean
on
the
mainland
i
mean
there
is
no
sea
between
us
she
went
crimson
it
sounds
thrilling
said
frank
dryly
she
flashed
round
at
him
you
must
be
horrid
about
jasper
she
said
quickly
he
never
speaks
about
you
unkindly
i
do
see
why
he
should
said
frank
but
let
get
off
a
subject
which
is
which
is
what
she
challenged
which
is
controversial
said
frank
diplomatically
she
came
down
to
the
station
to
see
him
off
as
he
looked
out
of
the
window
waving
his
farewells
he
thought
he
had
never
seen
a
more
lovely
being
or
one
more
desirable
it
was
in
the
afternoon
of
that
day
which
saw
frank
merrill
speeding
toward
the
swiss
frontier
and
paris
that
rex
holland
strode
into
the
palace
hotel
at
montreux
and
seated
himself
at
a
table
in
the
restaurant
the
hour
was
late
and
the
room
was
almost
deserted
giovanni
the
head
waiter
recognized
him
and
came
hurriedly
across
the
room
ah
he
said
you
are
back
from
england
i
did
expect
you
till
the
winter
sports
had
started
is
paris
very
dull
i
did
come
through
paris
said
the
other
shortly
there
are
many
roads
leading
to
switzerland
but
few
pleasant
roads
i
have
come
to
montreux
by
all
manner
of
ways
from
paris
through
pontarlier
through
ostend
brussels
through
the
hook
of
holland
and
amsterdam
but
paris
is
the
only
way
for
the
man
who
is
flying
to
this
beautiful
land
the
man
at
the
table
said
nothing
scanning
the
menu
carefully
he
looked
tired
as
one
who
had
taken
a
very
long
journey
it
may
interest
you
to
know
he
said
after
he
had
given
his
order
and
as
giovanni
was
turning
away
that
i
came
by
the
longest
route
tell
me
giovanni
have
you
a
man
called
merrill
staying
at
the
hotel
no
said
the
other
is
he
a
friend
of
yours
rex
holland
smiled
in
a
sense
he
is
a
friend
in
a
sense
he
is
not
he
said
flippantly
and
offered
no
further
enlightenment
although
giovanni
waited
with
a
deferential
cock
of
his
head
later
when
he
had
finished
his
modest
dinner
he
strolled
into
the
one
long
street
of
the
town
returning
to
the
writing
room
of
the
hotel
with
a
number
of
papers
which
included
the
visitors
list
a
publication
printed
in
english
and
which
as
it
related
the
comings
and
goings
of
visitors
not
only
to
lausanne
montreux
and
teritet
but
also
to
evian
and
geneva
enjoyed
a
fair
circulation
he
sat
at
the
table
and
drawing
a
sheet
of
paper
from
the
rack
wrote
addressed
an
envelope
to
frank
merrill
esquire
hotel
de
france
geneva
slipped
it
into
the
hotel
pillar
box
and
went
to
bed
there
a
letter
here
for
frank
said
the
girl
i
wonder
if
it
is
from
his
agent
she
examined
the
envelope
which
bore
the
montreux
postmark
i
should
imagine
it
is
said
saul
arthur
mann
well
i
am
going
to
open
it
anyway
said
the
girl
poor
frank
he
will
be
in
a
state
of
suspense
she
tore
open
the
envelope
and
took
out
a
letter
mann
saw
her
face
go
white
and
the
letter
trembled
in
her
hand
without
a
word
she
passed
it
to
him
and
he
read
dear
frank
merrill
said
the
letter
give
me
another
month
grace
and
then
you
may
tell
the
whole
story
yours
rex
holland
saul
arthur
mann
stared
at
the
letter
with
open
mouth
what
does
it
mean
asked
the
girl
in
a
whisper
it
means
that
merrill
is
shielding
somebody
said
the
other
it
means
suddenly
his
face
lit
up
with
excitement
the
writing
he
gasped
her
eyes
followed
his
and
for
a
moment
she
did
not
understand
then
with
a
lightning
sweep
of
her
arm
she
snatched
the
letter
from
his
hand
and
crumpled
it
in
a
ball
the
writing
said
mann
again
i
seen
it
before
it
is
jasper
cole
she
looked
at
him
steadily
though
her
face
was
white
and
the
hand
which
grasped
the
crumpled
paper
was
shaking
i
think
you
are
mistaken
mann
she
said
quietly
chapter
xiv
the
man
who
looked
like
frank
saul
arthur
mann
came
back
to
england
full
of
his
news
and
found
frank
at
the
little
jermyn
street
hotel
where
he
had
installed
himself
and
frank
listened
without
interruption
to
the
story
of
the
letter
of
course
the
little
fellow
went
on
i
went
straight
over
to
montreux
the
note
heading
was
not
on
the
paper
but
i
had
no
difficulty
by
comparing
the
qualities
of
papers
used
at
the
various
hotels
in
discovering
that
it
was
written
from
the
palace
the
head
waiter
knew
this
rex
holland
who
had
been
a
frequent
visitor
had
always
tipped
very
liberally
and
lived
in
something
like
style
he
could
not
describe
his
patron
except
that
he
was
a
young
man
with
a
very
languid
manner
who
had
arrived
the
previous
morning
from
holland
and
had
immediately
inquired
for
frank
merrill
from
holland
are
you
sure
it
was
the
morning
i
have
a
particular
reason
for
asking
asked
frank
quickly
no
it
was
not
in
the
morning
now
you
mention
it
it
was
in
the
evening
he
left
again
the
following
morning
by
the
northern
train
how
did
he
find
my
address
asked
frank
obviously
from
the
visitors
list
the
waiter
on
duty
in
the
writing
room
remembered
having
seen
him
consulting
the
newspaper
now
my
boy
you
have
to
be
perfectly
candid
with
me
what
do
you
know
about
rex
holland
frank
opened
his
case
took
out
a
cigarette
and
lit
it
before
he
replied
i
know
what
everybody
knows
about
him
he
said
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
in
his
voice
and
something
which
nobody
knows
but
me
but
my
dear
fellow
said
saul
arthur
mann
laying
his
hand
on
the
other
shoulder
surely
you
realize
how
important
it
is
for
you
that
you
should
tell
me
all
you
know
frank
shook
his
head
the
time
is
not
come
he
said
and
he
would
make
no
further
statement
but
on
another
matter
he
was
emphatic
by
heaven
mann
i
am
not
going
to
stand
by
and
see
may
ruin
her
life
there
something
sinister
in
this
influence
which
jasper
is
exercising
over
her
you
have
seen
it
for
yourself
saul
arthur
nodded
i
ca
understand
what
it
is
he
confessed
of
course
jasper
is
not
a
fellow
he
has
perfect
manners
and
is
a
charming
companion
you
do
think
that
he
is
winning
on
his
merits
frank
shook
his
head
no
indeed
i
do
not
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
discuss
my
private
affairs
and
you
know
how
reluctant
i
am
to
do
so
but
you
are
also
aware
of
what
i
think
of
may
i
was
hoping
that
we
should
go
back
to
the
place
where
we
left
off
and
although
she
is
kindness
itself
this
girl
who
is
more
to
me
than
anything
or
anybody
in
the
world
and
who
was
prepared
to
marry
me
and
would
have
married
me
but
for
jasper
machinations
was
almost
cold
he
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
and
now
halted
in
his
stride
and
spread
out
his
arms
despairingly
what
am
i
to
do
i
can
not
lose
her
i
can
not
there
was
a
fierceness
in
his
tone
which
revealed
the
depth
of
his
feeling
and
saul
arthur
mann
understood
i
think
it
is
too
soon
to
say
you
have
lost
her
frank
he
said
he
had
conceived
a
genuine
liking
for
frank
merrill
and
the
period
of
tribulation
through
which
the
young
man
had
passed
had
heightened
the
respect
in
which
he
held
him
we
shall
see
light
in
dark
places
before
we
go
much
farther
he
said
there
is
something
behind
this
crime
frank
which
i
do
understand
but
which
i
am
certain
is
no
mystery
to
you
i
am
sure
that
you
are
shielding
somebody
for
what
reason
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
tell
but
i
will
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
no
event
in
the
interesting
life
of
this
little
man
who
had
spent
his
years
in
the
accumulation
of
facts
had
so
distressed
and
piqued
him
as
the
murder
of
john
minute
the
case
had
ended
where
the
trial
had
left
it
crawley
who
might
have
offered
a
new
aspect
to
the
tragedy
had
disappeared
as
completely
as
though
the
earth
had
swallowed
him
the
most
strenuous
efforts
which
the
official
police
had
made
added
to
the
investigations
which
saul
arthur
mann
had
conducted
independently
had
failed
to
trace
the
fugitive
of
police
obviously
he
was
not
to
be
confounded
with
rex
holland
he
was
a
distinct
personality
working
possibly
in
collusion
but
there
the
association
ended
it
had
occurred
to
the
investigator
that
possibly
crawley
had
accompanied
rex
holland
in
his
flight
but
the
most
careful
inquiries
which
he
had
pursued
at
montreux
were
fruitless
in
this
respect
as
in
all
others
to
add
to
his
bewilderment
investigations
nearer
at
home
were
constantly
bringing
him
across
the
track
of
frank
merrill
it
was
as
though
fate
had
conspired
to
show
the
boy
in
the
blackest
light
frank
had
been
acting
as
secretary
to
his
uncle
and
then
jasper
cole
had
suddenly
appeared
upon
the
scene
from
nowhere
in
particular
the
suggestion
had
been
made
somewhat
vaguely
that
he
had
come
from
abroad
and
it
was
certain
that
he
arrived
as
a
result
of
long
negotiations
which
john
minute
himself
had
conducted
they
were
negotiations
which
involved
months
of
correspondence
no
letter
of
which
either
from
one
or
the
other
had
frank
seen
while
the
trial
was
pending
the
little
man
collected
quite
a
volume
of
information
both
from
frank
and
the
girl
but
nothing
had
been
quite
as
inexplicable
as
this
intrusion
of
jasper
cole
upon
the
scene
or
the
extraordinary
mystery
which
john
minute
had
made
of
his
engagement
he
had
written
and
posted
all
the
letters
to
jasper
himself
and
had
apparently
received
the
replies
which
he
had
burned
at
some
other
address
of
which
frank
was
ignorant
jasper
had
come
and
then
one
day
there
had
been
a
quarrel
not
between
the
two
young
men
but
between
frank
and
his
uncle
it
was
a
singularly
bitter
quarrel
and
again
frank
refused
to
discuss
the
cause
he
left
the
impression
upon
saul
arthur
mind
that
he
had
to
some
extent
been
responsible
and
here
was
another
fact
which
puzzled
the
man
who
knew
sergeant
smith
as
he
was
then
had
been
to
some
extent
responsible
it
was
frank
who
had
introduced
the
sergeant
to
eastbourne
and
brought
him
to
his
uncle
but
this
was
only
one
aspect
of
the
mystery
there
were
others
as
obscure
saul
arthur
mann
went
back
to
his
bureau
and
for
the
twentieth
time
gathered
the
considerable
dossiers
he
had
accumulated
relating
to
the
case
and
to
the
characters
and
went
through
them
systematically
and
carefully
he
left
his
office
near
midnight
but
at
nine
the
next
morning
was
on
his
way
to
eastbourne
constable
wiseman
was
by
good
fortune
enjoying
a
day
holiday
and
was
at
work
in
his
kitchen
garden
when
mann
car
pulled
up
before
the
cottage
wiseman
received
his
visitor
importantly
for
though
the
constable
prestige
was
regarded
in
official
circles
as
having
diminished
as
a
result
of
the
trial
it
was
felt
by
the
villagers
that
their
policeman
if
he
had
not
solved
the
mystery
of
john
minute
death
had
at
least
gone
a
long
way
to
its
solution
in
the
spotless
room
which
was
half
kitchen
and
half
sitting
room
with
its
floor
covered
by
bright
matting
wiseman
produced
a
windsor
chair
which
she
placed
at
saul
arthur
disposal
before
she
politely
vanished
in
a
very
few
words
the
investigator
stated
his
errand
and
constable
wiseman
listened
in
noncommittal
silence
when
his
visitor
had
finished
he
shook
his
head
the
only
thing
about
the
sergeant
i
know
he
said
i
have
already
told
the
chief
constable
who
sat
in
that
very
chair
he
explained
he
was
always
a
bit
of
a
mystery
the
sergeant
i
mean
when
he
was
if
i
may
use
the
expression
he
would
tell
you
stories
by
the
hour
but
when
he
was
sober
you
could
get
a
word
out
of
him
his
daughter
only
lived
with
him
for
about
a
fortnight
his
daughter
said
mann
quickly
he
had
a
daughter
as
i
already
notified
my
superiors
said
constable
wiseman
gravely
rather
a
pretty
girl
i
never
saw
much
of
her
but
she
was
in
eastbourne
off
and
on
for
about
a
fortnight
after
the
sergeant
came
funny
thing
i
happen
to
know
the
day
he
arrived
because
the
wheel
of
his
fly
came
off
on
my
beat
and
i
noticed
the
circumstances
according
to
law
and
reported
the
same
i
do
even
know
if
she
was
living
with
him
he
had
a
cottage
down
at
birlham
gap
and
that
is
where
i
saw
her
yes
she
was
a
pretty
girl
he
said
reminiscently
one
of
the
slim
and
slender
kind
very
dark
and
with
a
complexion
like
milk
but
they
never
found
her
he
said
again
mann
interrupted
you
mean
the
police
constable
wiseman
shook
his
head
oh
no
he
said
they
been
looking
for
her
for
years
long
before
mr
minute
was
killed
who
are
well
several
people
said
the
constable
slowly
i
happen
to
know
that
cole
wanted
to
find
out
where
she
was
but
then
he
did
start
searching
until
weeks
after
she
disappeared
it
is
very
rum
mused
constable
wiseman
the
way
cole
went
about
it
he
did
come
straight
to
us
and
ask
our
assistance
but
he
had
a
lot
of
private
detectives
nosing
round
eastbourne
one
of
happened
to
be
a
cousin
of
my
wife
so
we
got
to
know
about
it
cole
spent
a
lot
of
money
trying
to
trace
her
and
so
did
mr
minute
saul
arthur
mann
saw
a
faint
gleam
of
daylight
mr
minute
too
he
asked
was
he
working
with
mr
cole
so
far
as
i
can
find
out
they
were
both
working
independent
of
the
other
cole
and
mr
minute
explained
wiseman
it
is
what
i
call
a
mystery
within
a
mystery
and
it
has
never
been
properly
cleared
up
i
thought
something
was
coming
out
about
it
at
the
trial
but
you
know
what
a
mess
the
lawyers
made
of
it
it
was
constable
wiseman
firm
conviction
that
frank
merrill
had
escaped
through
the
incompetence
of
the
crown
authorities
and
there
were
moments
in
his
domestic
circle
when
he
was
bitter
and
even
insubordinate
on
the
subject
you
still
think
merrill
was
guilty
asked
saul
arthur
mann
as
he
took
his
leave
of
the
other
i
am
as
sure
of
it
as
i
am
that
i
am
standing
here
said
the
constable
not
without
a
certain
pride
in
the
consistency
of
his
view
did
i
go
into
the
room
was
he
there
with
the
deceased
his
revolver
found
had
there
been
some
with
his
books
in
london
saul
arthur
mann
smiled
there
are
some
of
us
who
think
differently
constable
he
said
shaking
hands
with
the
implacable
officer
of
the
law
he
brought
back
to
london
a
few
new
facts
to
be
added
to
his
record
of
sergeant
crawley
alias
smith
and
on
these
he
went
painstakingly
to
work
as
has
been
already
explained
saul
arthur
mann
had
a
particularly
useful
relationship
with
scotland
yard
and
fortunately
about
that
time
he
was
on
the
most
excellent
terms
with
official
police
headquarters
for
he
had
been
able
to
assist
them
in
running
to
earth
one
of
the
most
powerful
blackmailing
gangs
that
had
ever
operated
in
europe
his
files
had
been
drawn
upon
to
such
good
purpose
that
the
police
had
secured
convictions
against
the
seventeen
members
of
the
gang
who
were
in
england
he
sought
an
interview
with
the
chief
commissioner
and
that
same
night
accompanied
by
a
small
army
of
detectives
he
made
a
systematic
search
of
silvers
rents
the
house
into
which
jasper
cole
had
been
seen
to
enter
was
again
raided
and
again
without
result
the
house
was
empty
save
for
one
room
a
big
room
which
was
simply
furnished
with
a
a
table
a
chair
a
lamp
and
a
strip
of
carpet
there
were
four
rooms
two
upstairs
which
were
never
used
and
two
on
the
ground
floor
at
the
end
of
a
passage
was
a
kitchen
which
also
was
empty
save
for
a
length
of
bamboo
ladder
from
the
kitchen
a
bolted
door
led
on
to
a
tiny
square
of
yard
which
was
separated
by
three
walls
from
yards
of
similar
dimensions
to
left
and
right
and
to
the
back
of
the
premises
at
the
back
of
silvers
rents
was
royston
court
which
was
another
running
parallel
with
silvers
rents
mann
returned
to
the
house
and
again
searched
the
upstairs
rooms
looking
particularly
for
a
trapdoor
for
the
bamboo
ladder
suggested
some
such
exit
this
time
however
he
completely
failed
jasper
cole
he
found
had
made
only
one
visit
to
the
house
since
john
death
it
is
a
curious
fact
as
showing
the
localizing
of
interest
that
silvers
rents
knew
nothing
of
what
had
occurred
almost
at
its
doors
and
though
it
had
at
its
finger
tips
all
the
gossip
of
the
docks
and
the
thames
iron
works
it
was
profoundly
ignorant
of
what
was
common
property
in
royston
court
it
is
even
more
remarkable
that
saul
arthur
mann
with
his
squadron
of
detectives
should
have
confined
their
investigations
to
silvers
rents
the
investigator
was
baffled
and
disappointed
but
by
the
oddest
of
chances
he
was
to
pick
up
yet
another
thread
of
the
minute
mystery
a
thread
which
however
was
to
lead
him
into
an
maze
than
that
which
he
had
already
and
so
unsuccessfully
attempted
to
penetrate
three
days
after
his
search
of
silvers
rents
business
took
mann
to
camden
town
to
be
exact
he
had
gone
at
the
request
of
the
police
to
holloway
jail
to
see
a
prisoner
who
had
turned
state
evidence
on
a
matter
in
which
the
police
and
mann
were
equally
interested
very
foolishly
he
had
dismissed
his
taxi
and
when
he
emerged
from
the
doors
there
was
no
conveyance
in
sight
he
decided
rather
than
take
the
trams
which
would
have
carried
him
to
king
cross
to
walk
and
since
he
hated
main
roads
he
had
taken
a
short
cut
which
as
he
knew
would
lead
him
into
the
hampstead
road
thus
he
found
himself
in
flowerton
road
a
thoroughfare
of
respectable
detached
houses
occupied
by
the
superior
industrial
type
he
was
striding
along
swinging
his
umbrella
and
humming
as
was
his
wont
an
unmusical
rendering
of
a
popular
tune
when
his
attention
was
attracted
to
a
sight
which
took
his
breath
away
and
brought
him
to
a
halt
it
was
half
past
five
and
dull
but
his
eyesight
was
excellent
and
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
make
a
mistake
the
houses
of
flowerton
road
stand
back
and
are
separated
from
the
sidewalk
by
diminutive
gardens
the
front
doors
are
approached
by
six
or
seven
steps
and
it
was
on
the
top
of
one
of
these
flights
in
front
of
an
open
door
that
the
scene
was
enacted
which
brought
mann
to
a
standstill
the
characters
were
a
young
man
and
a
girl
the
girl
was
extremely
pretty
and
very
pale
the
man
was
the
exact
double
of
frank
merrill
he
was
dressed
in
a
rough
tweed
suit
and
wore
a
soft
felt
hat
with
a
fairly
wide
brim
but
it
was
not
the
appearance
of
this
remarkable
apparition
which
startled
the
investigator
it
was
the
attitude
of
the
two
people
the
girl
was
evidently
pleading
with
her
companion
saul
arthur
mann
was
too
far
away
to
hear
what
she
said
but
he
saw
the
young
man
shake
himself
loose
from
the
girl
she
again
grasped
his
arm
and
raised
her
face
imploringly
mann
gasped
for
he
saw
the
young
man
hand
come
up
and
strike
her
back
into
the
house
then
he
caught
hold
of
the
door
and
banged
it
savagely
walked
down
the
stairs
and
turning
hurried
away
the
investigator
stood
as
though
he
were
rooted
to
the
spot
and
before
he
could
recover
himself
the
fellow
had
turned
the
corner
of
the
road
and
was
out
of
sight
saul
arthur
mann
took
off
his
hat
and
wiped
his
forehead
all
his
initiative
was
for
the
moment
paralyzed
he
walked
slowly
up
to
the
gate
and
hesitated
what
excuse
could
he
have
for
calling
if
this
were
frank
assuredly
his
own
views
were
all
wrong
and
the
mystery
was
a
greater
mystery
still
his
energies
began
to
reawaken
he
took
a
note
of
the
number
of
the
house
and
hurried
off
after
the
young
man
when
he
turned
the
corner
his
quarry
had
vanished
he
hurried
to
the
next
corner
but
without
overtaking
the
object
of
his
pursuit
fortunately
at
this
moment
he
found
an
empty
taxicab
and
hailed
it
grimm
hotel
jermyn
street
he
directed
at
least
he
could
satisfy
his
mind
upon
one
point
chapter
xv
a
letter
in
the
grate
grimm
hotel
is
in
reality
a
block
of
flats
with
a
restaurant
attached
the
restaurant
is
little
more
than
a
kitchen
from
whence
meals
are
served
to
residents
in
their
rooms
frank
suite
was
on
the
third
floor
and
mann
paying
his
cabman
hurried
into
the
hall
stepped
into
the
automatic
lift
pressed
the
button
and
was
deposited
at
frank
door
he
knocked
with
a
sickening
sense
of
apprehension
that
there
would
be
no
answer
to
his
delight
and
amazement
he
heard
firm
step
in
the
tiny
hall
of
his
flat
and
the
door
was
opened
frank
was
in
the
act
of
dressing
for
dinner
come
in
he
said
cheerily
and
tell
me
all
the
news
he
led
the
way
back
to
his
room
and
resumed
the
delicate
task
of
tying
his
dress
bow
how
long
have
you
been
here
asked
mann
frank
looked
at
him
inquiringly
how
long
have
i
been
here
he
repeated
i
can
not
tell
you
the
exact
time
but
i
have
been
here
since
a
short
while
after
lunch
mann
was
bewildered
and
still
unconvinced
what
clothes
did
you
take
off
it
was
frank
turn
to
look
amazed
and
bewildered
clothes
he
repeated
what
are
you
driving
at
my
dear
chap
what
suit
were
you
wearing
persisted
saul
arthur
mann
frank
disappeared
into
his
dressing
room
and
came
out
with
a
tumbled
bundle
which
he
dropped
on
a
chair
it
was
the
blue
suit
which
he
usually
affected
now
what
is
the
joke
it
is
no
joke
said
the
other
i
could
have
sworn
that
i
saw
you
less
than
half
an
hour
ago
in
camden
town
i
wo
pretend
that
i
do
know
where
camden
town
is
smiled
frank
but
i
have
not
visited
that
interesting
locality
for
many
years
saul
arthur
mann
was
silent
it
was
obvious
to
him
that
whoever
was
the
occupant
of
flowerton
road
it
was
not
frank
merrill
frank
listened
to
the
narrative
with
interest
you
were
probably
mistaken
the
light
played
you
a
trick
i
expect
he
said
but
mann
was
emphatic
i
could
have
taken
an
oath
in
a
court
that
it
was
you
he
said
frank
stared
out
of
the
window
how
very
curious
he
mused
i
suppose
i
can
not
very
well
prosecute
a
man
for
looking
like
me
poor
girl
of
whom
are
you
thinking
asked
the
other
i
was
thinking
of
the
unfortunate
woman
answered
frank
what
brutes
there
are
in
the
world
you
gave
me
a
terrible
fright
admitted
his
friend
frank
laugh
was
loud
and
hearty
i
suppose
you
saw
me
figuring
in
a
court
charged
with
common
assault
he
said
i
saw
more
than
that
said
the
other
gravely
and
i
see
more
than
that
now
suppose
you
have
a
double
and
suppose
that
double
is
working
in
collusion
with
your
enemies
frank
shook
his
head
wearily
my
dear
friend
he
said
with
a
little
smile
i
am
tired
of
supposing
things
come
and
dine
with
me
but
mann
had
another
engagement
moreover
he
wanted
to
think
things
out
thinking
things
out
was
a
process
which
brought
little
reward
in
this
instance
and
he
went
to
bed
that
night
a
vexed
and
puzzled
man
he
always
had
his
breakfast
in
bed
at
ten
in
the
morning
for
he
had
reached
the
age
of
habits
and
had
fixed
ten
since
it
gave
his
clerks
time
to
bring
down
his
personal
mail
from
the
office
to
his
private
residence
it
was
a
profitable
mail
it
was
an
exciting
mail
and
it
contained
an
element
of
rich
promise
for
it
included
a
letter
from
constable
wiseman
dear
sir
re
our
previous
conversation
i
have
just
come
across
one
of
the
photographs
of
the
young
lady
sergeant
smith
daughter
it
was
given
to
the
private
detective
who
was
searching
for
her
it
was
given
to
my
wife
by
her
cousin
and
i
send
it
to
you
hoping
it
may
be
of
some
use
yours
respectfully
peter
john
wiseman
the
photograph
was
wrapped
in
a
piece
of
tissue
paper
and
saul
arthur
mann
opened
it
eagerly
he
looked
at
the
oblong
card
and
gasped
for
the
girl
who
was
depicted
there
was
the
girl
he
had
seen
on
the
steps
of
flowerton
road
a
telephone
message
prepared
frank
for
the
news
and
an
hour
later
the
two
men
were
together
in
the
office
of
the
bureau
i
am
going
along
to
that
house
to
see
the
girl
said
saul
arthur
mann
will
you
come
with
all
the
pleasure
in
life
said
frank
curiously
enough
i
am
as
eager
to
find
her
as
you
i
remember
her
very
well
and
one
of
the
quarrels
i
had
with
my
uncle
was
due
to
her
she
had
come
up
to
the
house
on
behalf
of
her
father
and
i
thought
uncle
treated
her
rather
brutally
point
number
one
cleared
up
thought
saul
arthur
mann
then
she
disappeared
frank
went
on
and
jasper
came
on
the
scene
there
was
some
association
between
this
girl
and
jasper
which
i
have
never
been
able
to
fathom
all
i
know
is
that
he
took
a
tremendous
interest
in
her
and
tried
to
find
her
and
so
far
as
i
remember
he
never
succeeded
mann
car
was
at
the
door
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
deposited
before
the
prim
exterior
of
number
the
door
was
opened
by
a
girl
servant
who
stared
from
saul
arthur
mann
to
his
companion
there
is
a
lady
living
here
said
mann
he
produced
the
photograph
this
is
the
lady
the
girl
nodded
still
staring
at
frank
i
want
to
see
her
she
gone
said
the
girl
you
are
looking
at
me
very
intently
said
frank
have
you
ever
seen
me
before
yes
sir
said
the
girl
you
used
to
come
here
or
a
gentleman
very
much
like
you
you
are
mr
merrill
that
is
my
name
smiled
frank
but
i
do
not
think
i
have
ever
been
here
before
where
has
the
lady
gone
asked
saul
arthur
she
went
last
night
took
all
her
boxes
and
went
off
in
a
cab
is
anybody
living
in
the
house
no
sir
said
the
girl
how
long
have
you
been
in
service
here
about
a
week
sir
replied
the
girl
we
are
friends
of
hers
said
saul
arthur
shamelessly
and
we
have
been
asked
to
call
to
see
if
everything
is
all
right
the
girl
hesitated
but
saul
arthur
mann
with
that
air
of
authority
which
he
so
readily
assumed
swept
past
her
and
began
an
inspection
of
the
house
it
was
plainly
furnished
but
the
furniture
was
good
apparently
the
spurious
merrill
had
plenty
of
money
said
saul
arthur
mann
there
were
no
photographs
or
papers
visible
until
they
came
to
the
bedroom
where
in
the
grate
was
a
torn
sheet
of
paper
bearing
a
few
lines
of
fine
writing
which
mann
immediately
annexed
before
they
left
frank
again
asked
the
girl
was
the
gentleman
who
lived
here
really
like
me
yes
sir
said
the
little
slavey
have
a
good
look
at
me
said
frank
humorously
and
the
girl
stared
again
something
like
you
she
admitted
did
he
talk
like
me
i
never
heard
him
talk
sir
said
the
girl
tell
me
said
saul
arthur
mann
was
he
kind
to
his
wife
a
faint
grin
appeared
on
the
face
of
the
little
servant
they
was
always
rowing
she
admitted
a
bullying
fellow
he
was
and
she
was
frightened
of
him
are
you
the
police
she
asked
with
sudden
interest
frank
shook
his
head
no
we
are
not
the
police
he
gave
the
girl
half
a
crown
and
walked
down
the
steps
ahead
of
his
companion
it
is
rather
awkward
if
i
have
a
double
who
bullies
his
wife
and
lives
in
camden
town
he
said
as
the
car
hummed
back
to
the
city
office
saul
arthur
mann
was
silent
during
the
journey
and
only
answered
in
monosyllables
again
in
the
privacy
of
his
office
he
took
the
torn
letter
and
carefully
pieced
it
together
on
his
desk
it
bore
no
address
and
there
were
no
affectionate
preliminaries
you
must
get
out
of
london
saul
arthur
mann
saw
you
both
go
to
the
old
place
and
await
instructions
there
was
no
signature
but
across
the
table
the
two
men
looked
at
one
another
for
the
writing
was
the
writing
of
jasper
cole
chapter
xvi
the
coming
of
sergeant
smith
jasper
cole
at
that
moment
was
trudging
through
the
snow
to
the
little
châlet
which
may
nuttall
had
taken
on
the
slope
of
the
mountain
overlooking
chamonix
the
sleigh
which
had
brought
him
up
from
the
station
was
at
the
foot
of
the
rise
may
saw
him
from
the
veranda
and
a
welcome
he
stamped
the
snow
from
his
boots
and
ran
up
the
steps
of
the
veranda
to
meet
her
this
is
a
very
pleasant
surprise
she
said
giving
him
both
her
hands
and
looking
at
him
approvingly
he
had
lost
much
of
his
pallor
and
his
face
was
tanned
and
healthy
though
a
little
fine
drawn
it
was
rather
a
mad
thing
to
do
was
it
he
confessed
ruefully
you
are
such
a
confirmed
bachelor
jasper
that
i
believe
you
hate
doing
anything
outside
your
regular
routine
why
did
you
come
all
the
way
from
holland
to
the
haute
savoie
he
had
followed
her
into
the
warm
and
cozy
sitting
room
and
was
warming
his
chilled
fingers
by
the
big
log
fire
which
burned
on
the
hearth
can
you
ask
i
came
to
see
you
and
how
are
all
the
experiments
going
she
turned
him
to
another
topic
in
some
hurry
there
have
been
no
experiments
since
last
month
at
least
not
the
kind
of
experiments
you
mean
the
one
in
which
i
have
been
engaged
has
been
very
successful
and
what
was
that
she
asked
curiously
i
will
tell
you
one
of
these
days
he
said
he
was
staying
at
the
hôtel
des
alpes
and
hoped
to
be
a
week
in
chamonix
they
chatted
about
the
weather
the
early
snow
which
had
covered
the
valley
in
a
mantle
of
white
about
the
tantalizing
behavior
of
mont
blanc
which
had
not
been
visible
since
may
had
arrived
of
the
early
avalanches
which
awakened
her
with
their
thunder
on
the
night
of
her
arrival
of
the
pleasant
road
to
argentières
of
the
villages
by
the
col
de
balme
which
are
buried
in
snow
of
the
sparkling
ethereal
green
of
the
great
glacier
of
everything
save
that
which
was
nearest
to
their
thoughts
and
to
their
hearts
jasper
broke
the
ice
when
he
referred
to
frank
visit
to
geneva
how
did
you
know
she
asked
suddenly
grave
somebody
told
me
he
said
casually
jasper
were
you
ever
at
montreux
she
asked
looking
him
straight
in
the
eye
i
have
been
to
montreux
or
rather
to
caux
he
said
that
is
the
village
on
the
mountain
above
and
one
has
to
go
through
montreux
to
reach
it
why
did
you
ask
a
sudden
chill
had
fallen
upon
her
which
she
did
not
shake
off
that
day
or
the
next
they
made
the
usual
excursions
together
climbed
up
the
wooded
slopes
of
the
butte
and
on
the
third
morning
after
his
arrival
stood
together
in
the
clear
dawn
and
watched
the
first
pink
rays
of
the
sun
striking
the
humped
summit
of
mont
blanc
is
it
glorious
she
whispered
he
nodded
the
serene
beauty
of
it
all
the
purity
the
majestic
aloofness
of
mountains
at
once
depressed
and
exalted
her
brought
her
nearer
to
the
sublimity
of
ancient
truths
cleansed
her
of
petty
fears
she
turned
to
him
unexpectedly
and
asked
jasper
who
killed
john
minute
he
made
no
reply
his
wistful
eyes
were
fixed
hungrily
upon
the
glories
of
light
and
shade
of
space
of
inaccessibility
of
purity
of
coloring
of
all
that
dawn
upon
mont
blanc
comprehended
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
lowered
to
almost
a
whisper
i
know
that
the
man
who
killed
john
minute
is
alive
and
free
he
said
who
was
he
if
you
do
not
know
now
you
may
never
know
he
said
there
was
a
silence
which
lasted
for
fully
five
minutes
and
the
crimson
light
upon
the
mountain
top
had
paled
to
lemon
yellow
then
she
asked
again
are
you
directly
or
indirectly
guilty
he
shook
his
head
neither
directly
nor
indirectly
he
said
shortly
and
the
next
minute
she
was
in
his
arms
there
had
been
no
word
of
love
between
them
no
tender
passage
no
letter
which
the
world
could
not
read
it
was
a
which
had
begun
where
other
end
in
conquest
and
in
surrender
in
this
strange
way
beyond
all
understanding
may
nuttall
became
engaged
and
announced
the
fact
in
the
briefest
of
letters
to
her
friends
a
fortnight
later
the
girl
arrived
in
england
and
was
met
at
charing
cross
by
saul
arthur
mann
she
was
radiantly
happy
and
bubbling
over
with
good
spirits
a
picture
of
health
and
beauty
all
this
mann
observed
with
a
sinking
heart
he
had
a
duty
to
perform
and
that
duty
was
not
a
pleasant
one
he
knew
it
was
useless
to
reason
with
the
girl
he
could
offer
her
no
more
than
theories
and
suspicions
but
at
least
he
had
one
trump
card
he
debated
in
his
mind
whether
he
should
play
this
for
here
too
his
information
was
of
the
scantiest
description
he
carried
his
account
of
the
girl
to
frank
merrill
my
dear
frank
she
is
simply
infatuated
said
the
little
man
in
despair
oh
if
that
infernal
record
of
mine
was
only
completed
i
could
convince
her
in
a
second
there
is
no
single
investigation
i
have
ever
undertaken
which
has
been
so
disappointing
can
nothing
be
done
asked
frank
i
can
not
believe
that
it
will
happen
marry
jasper
great
cæsar
after
all
his
voice
was
hoarse
the
hand
he
raised
in
protest
shook
saul
arthur
mann
scratched
his
chin
reflectively
suppose
you
saw
her
he
suggested
and
added
a
little
grimly
i
will
see
cole
at
the
same
time
frank
hesitated
i
can
understand
your
reluctance
the
little
man
went
on
but
there
is
too
much
at
stake
to
allow
your
finer
feelings
to
stop
you
this
matter
has
got
to
be
prevented
at
all
costs
we
are
fighting
for
time
in
a
month
possibly
less
we
may
have
the
whole
of
the
facts
in
our
hands
have
you
found
out
anything
about
the
girl
in
camden
town
asked
frank
she
has
disappeared
completely
replied
the
other
every
clew
we
have
had
has
led
nowhere
frank
dressed
himself
with
unusual
care
that
afternoon
and
having
previously
telephoned
and
secured
the
girl
permission
to
call
he
presented
himself
to
the
minute
she
was
as
usual
cordiality
itself
i
was
rather
hurt
at
your
not
calling
before
frank
she
said
you
have
come
to
congratulate
me
she
looked
at
him
straight
in
the
eyes
as
she
said
this
you
can
hardly
expect
that
may
he
said
gently
knowing
how
much
you
are
to
me
and
how
greatly
i
wanted
you
honestly
i
can
not
understand
it
and
i
can
only
suppose
that
you
whom
i
love
better
than
anything
in
the
world
and
you
mean
more
to
me
than
any
other
being
share
the
suspicion
which
surrounds
me
like
a
poison
cloud
yet
if
i
shared
that
suspicion
she
said
calmly
would
i
let
you
see
me
no
frank
i
was
a
child
when
you
know
it
was
only
a
few
months
ago
but
i
believe
indeed
i
know
it
would
have
been
the
greatest
mistake
i
could
possibly
have
made
i
should
have
been
a
very
unhappy
woman
for
i
have
loved
jasper
all
along
she
said
this
evenly
without
any
display
of
emotion
or
embarrassment
frank
narrating
the
interview
to
saul
arthur
mann
described
the
speech
as
almost
mechanical
i
hope
you
are
going
to
take
it
nicely
she
went
on
that
we
are
going
to
be
such
good
friends
as
we
always
were
and
that
even
the
memory
of
your
poor
uncle
death
and
the
ghastly
trial
which
followed
and
the
part
that
jasper
played
will
not
spoil
our
friendship
but
do
you
see
what
it
means
to
me
he
burst
forth
and
for
a
second
they
looked
at
one
another
and
frank
divined
her
thoughts
and
winced
i
know
what
you
are
thinking
he
said
huskily
you
are
thinking
of
all
the
beastly
things
that
were
said
at
the
trial
that
if
i
had
gained
you
i
should
have
gained
all
that
i
tried
to
gain
she
went
red
it
was
horrid
of
me
was
it
she
confessed
and
yet
that
idea
came
to
me
one
can
not
control
one
thoughts
frank
and
you
must
be
content
to
know
that
i
believe
in
your
innocence
there
are
some
thoughts
which
flourish
in
one
mind
like
weeds
and
which
refuse
to
be
uprooted
do
blame
me
if
i
recalled
the
lawyer
words
it
was
an
involuntary
hateful
thought
he
inclined
his
head
there
is
another
thought
which
is
not
involuntary
she
went
on
and
it
is
because
i
want
to
retain
our
friendship
and
i
want
everything
to
go
on
as
usual
that
i
am
asking
you
one
question
your
birthday
has
come
and
gone
you
told
me
that
your
uncle
design
was
to
keep
you
unmarried
until
that
day
you
are
still
unmarried
and
your
birthday
has
passed
what
has
happened
many
things
have
happened
he
replied
quietly
my
uncle
is
dead
i
am
a
rich
man
apart
from
the
accident
of
his
legacy
i
could
meet
you
on
level
terms
i
knew
nothing
of
this
she
said
quickly
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
did
jasper
tell
you
he
asked
no
jasper
told
me
nothing
frank
drew
a
long
breath
then
i
can
only
say
that
until
the
mystery
of
my
uncle
death
is
solved
you
can
not
know
he
said
i
can
only
repeat
what
i
have
already
told
you
she
offered
her
hand
i
believe
you
frank
she
said
and
i
was
wrong
even
to
doubt
you
in
the
smallest
degree
he
took
her
hand
and
held
it
may
he
said
what
is
this
strange
fascination
that
jasper
has
over
you
for
the
second
time
in
that
interview
she
flushed
and
pulled
her
hand
back
there
is
nothing
unusual
in
the
fascination
which
jasper
exercises
she
smiled
quickly
recovering
almost
against
her
will
from
the
little
twinge
of
anger
she
felt
it
is
the
influence
which
every
woman
has
felt
and
which
you
one
day
will
feel
he
laughed
bitterly
then
nothing
will
make
you
change
your
mind
he
said
nothing
in
the
world
she
answered
emphatically
for
a
moment
she
was
sorry
for
him
as
he
stood
both
hands
resting
on
a
chair
his
eyes
on
the
ground
a
picture
of
despair
and
she
crossed
to
him
and
slipped
her
arm
through
his
do
take
it
so
badly
frank
she
said
softly
i
am
a
capricious
foolish
girl
i
know
and
i
am
really
not
worth
a
moment
suffering
he
shook
himself
together
gathered
up
his
hat
his
stick
and
his
overcoat
and
offered
his
hand
he
said
and
good
luck
in
the
meantime
another
interview
of
a
widely
different
character
was
taking
place
in
the
little
house
which
jasper
cole
occupied
on
the
portsmouth
road
jasper
and
saul
arthur
mann
had
met
before
but
this
was
the
first
visit
that
the
investigator
had
paid
to
the
home
of
john
minute
heir
jasper
was
waiting
at
the
door
to
greet
the
little
man
when
he
arrived
and
had
offered
him
a
quiet
but
warm
welcome
and
led
the
way
to
the
beautiful
study
which
was
half
laboratory
which
he
had
built
for
himself
since
john
minute
death
i
am
coming
straight
to
the
point
without
any
beating
about
the
bush
cole
said
the
little
man
depositing
his
bag
on
the
side
of
his
chair
and
opening
it
with
a
jerk
i
will
tell
you
frankly
that
i
am
acting
on
merrill
behalf
and
that
i
am
also
acting
as
i
believe
in
the
interests
of
justice
your
motives
at
any
rate
are
admirable
said
jasper
pushing
back
the
papers
which
littered
his
big
library
table
and
seating
himself
on
the
edge
you
are
probably
aware
that
you
are
to
some
extent
under
suspicion
mr
cole
under
your
suspicion
or
the
suspicion
of
the
authorities
asked
the
other
coolly
under
mine
said
saul
arthur
mann
emphatically
i
can
not
speak
for
the
authorities
in
what
direction
does
this
suspicion
run
he
thrust
his
hands
deep
in
his
trousers
pockets
and
eyed
the
other
keenly
my
first
suspicion
is
that
you
are
well
aware
as
to
who
murdered
john
minute
jasper
cole
nodded
i
am
perfectly
aware
that
he
was
murdered
by
your
friend
merrill
he
said
i
suggest
said
saul
arthur
mann
calmly
that
you
know
the
murderer
and
you
know
the
murderer
was
frank
merrill
jasper
made
no
reply
and
a
faint
smile
flickered
for
a
second
at
the
corner
of
his
mouth
but
he
gave
no
other
sign
of
his
inward
feelings
and
the
other
point
you
wish
to
raise
he
asked
the
other
is
a
more
delicate
subject
since
it
involves
a
lady
said
the
little
man
you
are
about
to
be
married
to
miss
nuttall
jasper
cole
nodded
you
have
obtained
an
extraordinary
influence
over
the
lady
in
this
past
few
months
i
hope
so
said
the
other
cheerfully
it
is
an
influence
which
might
have
been
brought
about
by
normal
methods
but
it
is
also
one
saul
arthur
leaned
over
and
tapped
the
table
emphatically
with
each
word
which
might
be
secured
by
a
very
clever
chemist
who
had
found
a
way
of
sapping
the
will
of
his
victim
by
the
administration
of
drugs
asked
jasper
by
the
administration
of
drugs
repeated
saul
arthur
mann
jasper
cole
smiled
i
should
like
to
know
the
drug
he
said
one
would
make
a
fortune
to
say
nothing
of
benefiting
humanity
to
an
extraordinary
degree
by
its
employment
for
example
i
might
give
you
a
dose
and
you
would
tell
me
all
that
you
know
i
am
told
that
your
knowledge
is
fairly
extensive
he
bantered
surely
you
mann
with
your
remarkable
collection
of
information
on
all
subjects
under
the
sun
do
not
suggest
that
such
a
drug
exists
on
the
contrary
said
the
man
who
knew
in
triumph
it
is
known
and
is
employed
it
was
known
as
long
ago
as
the
days
of
the
borgias
it
was
employed
in
france
in
the
days
of
louis
xvi
it
has
been
to
some
extent
rediscovered
and
used
in
lunatic
asylums
to
quiet
dangerous
patients
he
saw
the
interest
deepen
in
the
other
eyes
i
have
never
heard
of
that
said
jasper
slowly
the
only
drug
that
is
employed
for
that
purpose
is
as
far
as
i
know
bromide
of
potassium
mann
produced
a
slip
of
paper
and
read
off
a
list
of
names
mostly
of
mental
institutions
in
the
united
states
of
america
and
in
germany
oh
that
drug
said
jasper
cole
contemptuously
i
know
the
use
to
which
that
is
put
there
was
an
article
on
the
subject
in
the
medical
three
months
ago
it
is
a
modified
kind
of
sleep
hyocine
and
morphia
i
afraid
mann
he
went
on
you
have
come
on
a
fruitless
errand
and
speaking
as
a
humble
student
of
science
i
may
suggest
without
offense
that
your
theories
are
wholly
fantastic
then
i
will
put
another
suggestion
to
you
cole
said
the
little
man
without
resentment
and
to
me
this
constitutes
the
chief
reason
why
you
should
not
marry
the
lady
whose
confidence
i
enjoy
and
who
i
feel
sure
will
be
influenced
by
my
advice
and
what
is
that
asked
jasper
it
affects
your
own
character
and
it
is
in
consequence
a
very
embarrassing
matter
for
me
to
discuss
said
the
little
man
again
the
other
favored
him
with
that
inscrutable
smile
of
his
my
moral
character
i
presume
is
now
being
assailed
he
said
flippantly
please
go
on
you
promise
to
be
interesting
you
were
in
holland
a
short
time
ago
does
miss
nuttall
know
this
jasper
nodded
she
is
well
aware
of
the
fact
you
were
in
holland
with
a
lady
accused
mann
slowly
is
miss
nuttall
well
aware
of
this
fact
too
jasper
slipped
from
the
table
and
stood
upright
through
his
narrow
lids
he
looked
down
upon
his
accuser
is
that
all
you
know
he
asked
softly
not
all
but
one
of
the
things
i
know
retorted
the
other
you
were
seen
in
her
company
she
was
staying
in
the
same
hotel
with
you
as
cole
jasper
nodded
you
will
excuse
me
if
i
decline
to
discuss
the
matter
he
said
suppose
i
ask
miss
nuttall
to
discuss
it
challenged
the
little
man
you
are
the
master
of
your
own
actions
said
jasper
cole
quickly
and
i
dare
say
if
you
regard
it
as
expedient
you
will
tell
her
but
i
can
promise
you
that
whether
you
tell
her
or
not
i
shall
marry
miss
nuttall
with
this
he
ushered
his
visitor
to
the
door
and
hardly
waited
for
the
car
to
drive
off
before
he
had
shut
that
door
behind
him
late
that
night
the
two
friends
forgathered
and
exchanged
their
experiences
i
am
sure
there
is
something
very
wrong
indeed
said
frank
emphatically
she
was
not
herself
she
spoke
mechanically
almost
as
though
she
were
reciting
a
lesson
you
had
the
feeling
that
she
was
connected
by
wires
with
somebody
who
was
dictating
her
every
word
and
action
it
is
damnable
mann
what
can
we
do
we
must
prevent
the
marriage
said
the
little
man
quietly
and
employ
every
means
that
opportunity
suggests
to
that
purpose
make
no
mistake
he
said
emphatically
cole
will
stop
at
nothing
his
attitude
was
one
big
bluff
he
knows
that
i
have
beaten
him
it
was
only
by
luck
that
i
found
out
about
the
woman
in
holland
i
got
my
agent
to
examine
the
hotel
register
and
there
it
was
without
any
attempt
at
disguise
and
cole
of
london
the
thing
to
do
is
to
see
may
at
once
said
frank
and
put
all
the
facts
before
her
though
i
hate
the
idea
it
seems
like
sneaking
sneaking
exploded
saul
arthur
mann
what
nonsense
you
talk
you
are
too
full
of
scruples
my
friend
for
this
work
i
will
see
her
i
will
go
with
you
said
frank
after
a
moment
thought
i
have
no
wish
to
escape
my
responsibility
in
the
matter
she
will
probably
hate
me
for
my
interference
but
i
have
reached
beyond
the
point
where
i
care
so
long
as
she
can
be
saved
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
meet
one
another
at
the
office
in
the
morning
and
make
their
way
together
remember
this
said
mann
seriously
before
they
parted
that
if
cole
finds
the
game
is
up
he
will
stop
at
nothing
do
you
think
we
ought
to
take
precautions
asked
frank
honestly
i
do
confessed
the
other
i
do
think
we
can
get
the
men
from
the
yard
but
there
is
a
very
excellent
agency
which
sometimes
works
for
me
and
they
can
provide
a
guard
for
the
girl
i
wish
you
would
get
in
touch
with
them
said
frank
earnestly
i
am
worried
sick
over
this
business
she
ought
never
to
be
left
out
of
their
sight
i
will
see
if
i
can
have
a
talk
to
her
maid
so
that
we
may
know
whenever
she
is
going
out
there
ought
to
be
a
man
on
a
motor
cycle
always
waiting
about
the
savoy
to
follow
her
wherever
she
goes
they
parted
at
the
entrance
of
the
bureau
saul
arthur
mann
returning
to
telephone
the
necessary
instructions
how
necessary
they
were
was
proved
that
very
night
at
nine
may
was
sitting
down
to
a
solitary
dinner
when
a
telegram
was
delivered
to
her
it
was
from
the
chief
of
the
little
mission
in
which
she
had
been
interested
and
ran
very
urgent
have
something
of
the
greatest
importance
to
tell
you
it
was
signed
with
the
name
of
the
matron
of
the
mission
and
leaving
her
dinner
untouched
may
only
delayed
long
enough
to
change
her
dress
before
she
was
speeding
in
a
taxi
eastward
she
arrived
at
the
hall
which
was
the
headquarters
of
the
mission
to
find
it
in
darkness
a
man
who
was
evidently
a
new
helper
was
waiting
in
the
doorway
and
addressed
her
you
are
miss
nuttall
are
you
i
thought
so
the
matron
has
gone
down
to
silvers
rents
and
she
asked
me
to
go
along
with
you
the
girl
dismissed
the
taxi
and
in
company
with
her
guide
threaded
the
narrow
tangle
of
streets
between
the
mission
and
silvers
rents
she
was
halfway
along
one
of
the
thoroughfares
when
she
noticed
that
drawn
up
by
the
side
of
the
road
was
a
big
handsome
motor
car
and
she
wondered
what
had
brought
this
evidence
of
luxurious
living
to
the
mean
streets
of
canning
town
she
was
not
left
in
doubt
very
long
for
as
she
came
up
to
the
lights
and
was
shielding
her
eyes
from
their
glare
her
arms
were
tightly
grasped
a
shawl
was
thrown
over
her
head
and
she
was
lifted
and
thrust
into
the
car
interior
a
hand
gripped
her
throat
you
scream
and
i
will
kill
you
hissed
a
voice
in
her
ear
at
that
moment
the
car
started
and
the
girl
with
a
scream
which
was
strangled
in
her
throat
fell
swooning
back
on
the
seat
may
recovered
consciousness
to
find
the
car
still
rushing
forward
in
the
dark
and
the
hand
of
her
captor
still
resting
at
her
throat
you
be
a
sensible
girl
said
a
muffled
voice
and
do
as
you
told
and
no
harm
will
come
to
you
it
was
too
dark
to
see
his
face
and
it
was
evident
that
even
if
there
were
light
the
face
was
so
well
concealed
that
she
could
not
recognize
the
speaker
then
she
remembered
that
this
man
who
had
acted
as
her
guide
had
been
careful
to
keep
in
the
shadow
of
whatever
light
there
was
while
he
was
conducting
her
as
he
said
to
the
matron
where
are
you
taking
me
she
asked
you
know
in
time
was
the
noncommittal
answer
it
was
a
wild
night
rain
splashed
against
the
windows
of
the
car
and
she
could
hear
the
wind
howling
above
the
noise
of
the
engines
they
were
evidently
going
into
the
country
for
now
and
again
by
the
light
of
the
headlamps
she
glimpsed
hedges
and
trees
which
flashed
past
her
captor
suddenly
let
down
one
of
the
windows
and
leaned
out
giving
some
instructions
to
the
driver
what
they
were
she
guessed
for
the
lights
were
suddenly
switched
off
and
the
car
ran
in
darkness
the
girl
was
in
a
panic
for
all
her
bold
showing
she
knew
that
this
desperate
man
was
fearless
of
consequence
and
that
if
her
death
would
achieve
his
ends
and
the
ends
of
his
partners
her
life
was
in
imminent
peril
what
were
those
ends
she
wondered
were
these
the
same
men
who
had
done
to
death
john
minute
who
are
you
she
asked
there
was
a
little
chuckling
laugh
you
know
soon
enough
the
words
were
hardly
out
of
his
mouth
when
there
was
a
terrific
crash
the
car
stopped
suddenly
and
canted
over
and
the
girl
was
jerked
forward
to
her
knees
every
pane
of
glass
in
the
car
was
smashed
and
it
was
clear
from
the
angle
at
which
it
lay
that
irremediable
damage
had
been
done
the
man
scrambled
up
kicked
open
the
door
and
jumped
out
gate
sir
said
the
voice
of
the
chauffeur
broken
my
wrist
with
the
disappearance
of
her
captor
the
girl
had
felt
for
the
fastening
of
the
opposite
door
and
had
turned
it
to
her
delight
it
opened
smoothly
and
had
evidently
been
unaffected
by
the
jam
she
stepped
out
to
the
road
trembling
in
every
limb
she
felt
rather
than
saw
the
gate
and
knew
that
at
one
side
was
a
swing
gate
for
passengers
she
reached
this
when
her
abductor
discovered
her
flight
come
back
he
cried
hoarsely
she
heard
a
roar
and
saw
a
flashing
of
lights
and
fled
across
the
line
just
as
an
express
train
came
flying
northward
it
missed
her
by
inches
and
the
force
of
the
wind
threw
her
to
the
ground
she
scrambled
up
stumbled
across
the
remaining
rails
and
reaching
the
gate
opposite
fled
down
the
dark
road
she
had
gained
just
that
much
time
which
the
train
took
in
passing
she
ran
blindly
along
the
dark
road
slipping
and
stumbling
in
the
mud
and
she
heard
her
pursuer
squelching
through
the
mud
in
the
rear
the
wind
flew
her
hair
awry
the
rain
beat
down
upon
her
face
but
she
stumbled
on
suddenly
she
slipped
and
fell
and
as
she
struggled
to
her
feet
the
heavy
hand
of
her
pursuer
fell
upon
her
shoulder
and
she
screamed
aloud
none
of
that
said
the
voice
and
his
hand
covered
her
mouth
at
that
moment
a
bright
light
enveloped
the
two
a
light
so
intensely
dazzlingly
white
so
unexpected
that
it
hit
the
girl
almost
like
a
blow
it
came
from
somewhere
not
two
yards
away
and
the
man
released
his
hold
upon
the
girl
and
stared
at
the
light
hello
said
a
voice
from
the
darkness
what
the
game
she
was
behind
the
man
and
could
not
see
his
face
all
that
she
knew
was
that
here
was
help
unexpected
heaven
sent
and
she
strove
to
recover
her
breath
and
her
speech
it
all
right
growled
the
man
she
a
lunatic
and
i
taking
her
to
the
asylum
suddenly
the
light
was
pushed
forward
to
the
man
face
and
a
heavy
hand
was
laid
upon
his
shoulder
you
are
are
you
said
the
other
well
i
am
going
to
take
you
to
a
lunatic
asylum
sergeant
smith
or
crawley
or
whatever
your
name
is
you
know
me
my
name
wiseman
for
a
moment
the
man
stood
as
though
petrified
and
then
with
a
sudden
jerk
he
wrenched
his
hand
free
and
sprang
at
the
policeman
with
a
wild
yell
of
rage
and
in
a
second
both
men
were
rolling
over
in
the
darkness
constable
wiseman
was
no
child
but
he
had
lost
his
initial
advantage
and
by
the
time
he
got
to
his
feet
and
had
found
his
electric
torch
crawley
had
vanished
chapter
xvii
the
man
called
merrill
if
wiseman
did
not
think
you
were
a
murderer
i
should
regard
him
as
an
intelligent
being
said
saul
arthur
mann
have
they
found
crawley
asked
frank
no
he
got
away
the
chauffeur
and
the
car
were
hired
from
a
west
end
garage
with
this
story
of
a
lunatic
who
had
to
be
removed
to
an
asylum
and
apparently
crawley
or
smith
was
the
man
who
hired
them
he
even
paid
a
little
extra
for
the
damage
which
the
alleged
lunatic
might
do
the
car
the
chauffeur
says
that
he
had
some
doubt
and
had
intended
to
inform
the
police
after
he
had
arrived
at
his
destination
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
just
outside
eastbourne
when
the
accident
occurred
the
man
who
knew
paused
where
did
he
say
he
was
taking
her
he
asked
frank
he
was
told
to
drive
into
eastbourne
where
more
detailed
instructions
would
be
given
to
him
the
police
have
confirmed
his
story
and
he
has
been
released
i
have
just
come
from
may
said
frank
she
looks
none
the
worse
for
her
exciting
adventure
i
hope
you
have
arranged
to
have
her
guarded
saul
arthur
mann
nodded
it
will
be
the
last
adventure
of
that
kind
our
friend
will
attempt
he
said
still
this
enlightens
us
a
little
we
know
that
rex
holland
has
an
accomplice
and
that
accomplice
is
sergeant
smith
so
we
may
presume
that
they
were
both
in
the
murder
constable
wiseman
has
been
suitably
rewarded
as
he
well
deserves
said
frank
heartily
you
bear
no
malice
smiled
saul
arthur
mann
frank
laughed
and
shook
his
head
how
can
one
he
asked
simply
may
had
another
visitor
jasper
cole
came
hurriedly
to
london
at
the
first
intimation
of
the
outrage
but
was
reassured
by
the
appearance
it
was
awfully
thrilling
she
said
but
really
i
am
not
greatly
distressed
in
fact
i
think
i
look
less
tired
than
you
he
nodded
that
is
very
possible
i
did
not
go
to
bed
until
very
late
this
morning
he
said
i
was
so
engrossed
in
my
research
work
that
i
did
not
realize
it
was
morning
until
they
brought
me
my
tea
you
have
been
in
bed
all
night
she
said
shocked
and
shook
her
head
reprovingly
that
is
one
of
your
habits
of
life
which
will
have
to
be
changed
she
warned
him
jasper
cole
did
not
dismiss
her
unpleasant
experience
as
lightly
as
she
i
wonder
what
the
object
of
it
all
was
he
said
and
why
they
took
you
back
to
eastbourne
i
think
we
shall
find
that
the
headquarters
of
this
infernal
combination
is
somewhere
in
sussex
mann
does
think
so
she
said
but
believes
that
the
car
was
to
be
met
by
another
at
eastbourne
and
i
was
to
be
transferred
he
says
that
the
idea
of
taking
me
there
was
to
throw
the
police
off
the
scent
she
shivered
it
was
a
nice
experience
she
confessed
the
interview
took
place
in
the
afternoon
and
was
some
two
hours
after
frank
had
interviewed
the
girl
saul
arthur
mann
had
gone
to
eastbourne
to
bring
her
back
jasper
had
arranged
to
spend
the
night
in
town
and
had
booked
two
stalls
at
the
hippodrome
she
had
told
saul
arthur
mann
this
in
accordance
with
her
promise
to
keep
him
informed
as
to
her
movements
and
she
was
therefore
surprised
when
half
an
hour
later
the
little
investigator
presented
himself
she
met
him
in
the
presence
of
her
fiancé
and
it
was
clear
to
jasper
what
saul
arthur
mann
intentions
were
i
do
want
to
make
myself
a
nuisance
he
said
but
before
we
go
any
further
miss
nuttall
there
are
certain
matters
on
which
you
ought
to
be
informed
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
i
know
who
was
responsible
for
the
outrage
of
last
night
and
i
do
not
intend
risking
a
repetition
who
do
you
think
was
responsible
asked
the
girl
quietly
i
honestly
believe
that
the
author
is
in
this
room
was
the
startling
response
you
mean
me
asked
jasper
cole
angrily
i
mean
you
cole
i
believe
that
you
are
the
man
who
planned
the
coup
and
that
you
are
its
sole
author
said
the
other
the
girl
stared
at
him
in
astonishment
you
surely
do
not
mean
what
you
say
i
mean
that
cole
has
every
reason
for
wishing
to
marry
you
he
said
what
that
reason
is
i
do
not
know
completely
but
i
shall
discover
i
am
satisfied
he
went
on
slowly
that
cole
is
already
married
she
looked
from
one
to
the
other
already
married
repeated
jasper
if
he
is
not
already
married
said
saul
arthur
mann
bluntly
then
i
have
been
indiscreet
the
only
thing
i
can
tell
you
is
that
your
fiancé
has
been
traveling
on
the
continent
with
a
lady
who
describes
herself
as
mrs
cole
jasper
said
nothing
for
a
moment
but
looked
at
the
other
oddly
and
thoughtfully
i
understand
mann
he
said
at
length
that
you
collect
facts
as
other
people
collect
postage
stamps
saul
arthur
mann
bristled
you
may
carry
this
off
sir
he
began
if
you
can
let
me
speak
said
jasper
cole
raising
his
voice
i
want
to
ask
you
this
have
you
a
complete
record
of
john
minute
life
i
know
it
so
well
said
saul
arthur
mann
emphatically
that
i
could
repeat
his
history
word
for
word
will
you
sit
down
may
said
jasper
taking
the
girl
hand
in
his
and
gently
forcing
her
to
a
chair
we
are
going
to
put
mann
memory
to
the
test
do
you
seriously
mean
that
you
want
me
to
repeat
that
history
asked
the
other
suspiciously
i
mean
just
that
said
jasper
and
drew
up
a
chair
for
his
unpleasant
visitor
the
record
of
john
minute
life
came
trippingly
from
mann
tongue
he
knew
to
an
extraordinary
extent
the
details
of
that
strange
and
wild
career
in
said
the
investigator
continuing
his
narrative
he
was
married
at
bride
church
port
elizabeth
to
agnes
gertrude
cole
cole
murmured
jasper
the
little
man
looked
at
him
with
open
mouth
cole
good
lord
you
are
i
am
his
son
said
jasper
quietly
i
am
one
of
his
two
children
your
information
is
that
there
was
one
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
were
two
my
mother
left
my
father
with
one
of
the
greatest
scoundrels
that
has
ever
lived
he
took
her
to
australia
where
my
sister
was
born
six
months
after
she
had
left
john
minute
there
her
friend
deserted
her
and
she
worked
for
seven
years
as
a
kitchen
maid
in
melbourne
in
order
to
save
up
enough
money
to
bring
us
to
cape
town
my
mother
opened
a
tea
shop
off
aderley
street
and
earned
enough
to
educate
me
and
my
sister
it
was
there
she
met
crawley
and
crawley
promised
to
use
his
influence
with
my
father
to
bring
about
a
reconciliation
for
her
children
sake
i
do
not
know
what
was
the
result
of
his
attempt
but
i
gather
it
was
unsuccessful
and
things
went
on
very
much
as
they
were
before
then
one
day
when
i
was
still
at
the
south
african
college
my
mother
went
home
taking
my
sister
with
her
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
crawley
was
responsible
for
her
sailing
and
that
he
met
them
on
landing
all
that
i
knew
was
that
from
that
day
my
mother
disappeared
she
had
left
me
a
sum
of
money
to
continue
my
studies
but
after
eight
months
had
passed
and
no
word
had
come
from
her
i
decided
to
go
on
to
england
i
have
since
learned
what
had
happened
my
mother
had
been
seized
with
a
stroke
and
had
been
conveyed
to
the
workhouse
infirmary
by
crawley
who
had
left
her
there
and
had
taken
my
sister
who
apparently
he
passed
off
as
his
own
daughter
i
did
not
know
this
at
the
time
but
being
well
aware
of
my
identity
i
wrote
to
him
asking
him
for
help
to
discover
my
mother
he
answered
telling
me
that
my
mother
was
dead
that
crawley
had
told
him
so
and
that
there
was
no
trace
of
marguerite
my
sister
we
exchanged
a
good
many
letters
and
then
my
father
asked
me
to
come
and
act
as
his
secretary
and
assist
him
in
his
search
for
marguerite
what
he
did
not
know
was
that
crawley
alleged
daughter
whom
he
had
not
seen
was
the
girl
for
whom
he
was
seeking
i
fell
into
the
new
life
and
found
john
minute
i
can
scarcely
call
him
much
more
bearable
than
i
expected
and
then
one
day
i
found
my
mother
you
found
your
mother
said
saul
arthur
mann
a
light
dawning
upon
him
your
persistent
search
of
the
little
house
in
silvers
rents
produced
nothing
he
smiled
had
you
taken
the
bamboo
ladder
and
crossed
the
yard
at
the
back
of
the
house
into
another
yard
then
through
the
door
you
would
have
come
to
number
royston
court
and
you
would
have
been
considerably
surprised
to
find
an
interior
much
more
luxurious
than
you
would
have
expected
in
that
quarter
in
royston
court
they
spoke
of
number
as
house
with
the
nurses
because
there
were
always
three
nurses
on
duty
and
nobody
ever
saw
the
inside
of
the
house
but
themselves
there
you
would
have
found
my
mother
bedridden
and
indeed
so
ill
that
the
doctors
who
saw
her
would
not
allow
her
to
be
moved
from
the
house
i
furnished
this
hovel
piece
by
piece
generally
at
night
because
i
did
not
want
to
excite
the
curiosity
of
the
people
in
the
court
nor
did
i
wish
this
matter
to
reach
the
ears
of
john
minute
i
felt
that
while
i
retained
his
friendship
and
his
confidence
there
was
at
least
a
chance
of
his
reconciliation
with
my
mother
and
that
before
all
things
she
desired
it
was
not
to
be
he
said
sadly
john
minute
was
struck
down
at
the
moment
my
plans
seemed
as
though
they
were
going
to
result
in
complete
success
strangely
enough
with
his
death
my
mother
made
an
extraordinary
recovery
and
i
was
able
to
move
her
to
the
continent
she
had
always
wanted
to
see
holland
france
and
at
this
moment
he
turned
to
the
girl
with
a
smile
she
is
in
the
châlet
which
you
occupied
during
your
holiday
mann
was
dumfounded
all
his
pet
theories
had
gone
by
the
board
but
what
of
your
sister
he
asked
at
last
a
black
look
gathered
in
jasper
cole
face
my
sister
whereabouts
are
known
to
me
now
he
said
shortly
for
some
time
she
lived
in
camden
town
at
number
flowerton
road
at
the
present
moment
she
is
nearer
and
is
watched
night
and
day
almost
as
carefully
as
mann
agents
are
watching
you
he
smiled
again
at
the
girl
watching
me
she
said
startled
saul
arthur
mann
went
red
it
was
my
idea
he
said
stiffly
and
a
very
excellent
one
agreed
jasper
but
unfortunately
you
appointed
your
guards
too
late
mann
went
back
to
his
office
his
brain
in
a
whirl
yet
such
was
his
habit
that
he
did
not
allow
himself
to
speculate
upon
the
new
and
amazing
situation
until
he
had
carefully
jotted
down
every
new
fact
he
had
collected
it
was
astounding
that
he
had
overlooked
the
connection
between
jasper
cole
and
john
minute
wife
his
labors
did
not
cease
until
eleven
and
he
was
preparing
to
go
home
when
the
commissionaire
who
acted
as
caretaker
came
to
tell
him
that
a
lady
wished
to
see
him
a
lady
at
this
hour
of
the
night
said
mann
perturbed
tell
her
to
come
in
the
morning
i
have
told
her
that
sir
but
she
insists
upon
seeing
you
what
is
her
name
merrill
said
the
commissionaire
saul
arthur
mann
collapsed
into
his
chair
show
her
up
he
said
feebly
he
had
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
the
girl
who
came
timidly
into
the
room
as
the
original
of
the
photograph
which
had
been
sent
to
him
by
constable
wiseman
she
was
plainly
dressed
and
wore
no
ornament
and
she
was
undeniably
pretty
but
there
was
about
her
a
furtiveness
and
a
nervous
indecision
which
spoke
of
her
apprehension
sit
down
said
mann
kindly
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
for
you
i
am
merrill
she
said
timidly
so
the
commissionaire
said
replied
the
little
man
you
are
nervous
about
something
oh
i
am
so
frightened
said
the
girl
with
a
shudder
if
he
knows
i
have
been
here
he
you
have
nothing
to
be
frightened
about
just
sit
here
for
one
moment
he
went
into
the
next
room
which
had
a
branch
telephone
connection
and
called
up
may
she
was
out
and
he
left
an
urgent
message
that
she
was
to
come
bringing
jasper
with
her
as
soon
as
she
returned
when
he
got
back
to
his
office
he
found
the
girl
as
he
had
left
her
sitting
on
the
edge
of
a
big
armchair
plucking
nervously
at
her
handkerchief
i
have
heard
about
you
she
said
he
mentioned
you
once
before
we
went
to
that
sussex
cottage
with
crawley
they
were
going
to
bring
another
lady
and
i
was
to
look
after
her
but
he
who
is
asked
mann
my
husband
said
the
girl
how
long
have
you
been
married
demanded
the
little
man
i
ran
away
with
him
a
long
time
ago
she
said
it
has
been
an
awful
life
it
was
crawley
idea
he
told
me
that
if
i
married
merrill
he
would
take
me
to
see
my
mother
and
jasper
but
he
was
so
cruel
she
shuddered
again
we
been
living
in
furnished
houses
all
over
the
country
and
i
have
been
alone
most
of
the
time
and
he
would
not
let
me
go
out
by
myself
or
do
anything
she
spoke
in
a
subdued
monotonous
tone
that
betrayed
the
nearness
of
a
bad
nervous
breakdown
what
does
your
husband
call
himself
why
frank
merrill
said
the
girl
in
astonishment
that
his
name
crawley
always
told
me
his
name
was
merrill
is
it
mann
shook
his
head
my
poor
girl
he
said
sympathetically
i
am
afraid
you
have
been
grossly
deceived
the
man
you
married
as
merrill
is
an
impostor
an
impostor
she
faltered
mann
nodded
he
has
taken
a
good
man
name
and
i
am
afraid
has
committed
abominable
crimes
in
that
man
name
said
the
investigator
gently
i
hope
we
shall
be
able
to
rid
you
and
the
world
of
a
great
villain
still
she
stared
uncomprehendingly
he
has
always
been
a
liar
she
said
slowly
he
lied
naturally
and
acted
things
so
well
that
you
believed
him
he
told
me
things
which
i
know
are
true
he
told
me
my
brother
was
dead
but
i
saw
his
name
in
the
paper
the
other
day
and
that
is
why
i
came
to
you
do
you
know
jasper
she
was
as
naïve
and
as
unsophisticated
as
a
schoolgirl
and
it
made
the
little
man
heart
ache
to
hear
the
plaintive
monotony
of
tone
and
see
the
trembling
lip
i
promise
you
that
you
will
meet
your
brother
he
said
i
have
run
away
from
frank
she
said
suddenly
is
that
a
wicked
thing
to
do
i
could
not
stand
it
he
struck
me
again
yesterday
and
he
pretends
to
be
a
gentleman
my
mother
used
to
say
that
no
gentleman
ever
treats
a
woman
badly
but
frank
does
nobody
shall
treat
you
badly
any
more
said
mann
i
hate
him
she
went
on
with
sudden
vehemence
he
sneers
and
says
he
going
to
get
another
wife
and
oh
he
saw
her
hands
go
up
to
her
face
and
saw
her
staring
eyes
turn
to
the
door
in
affright
frank
merrill
stood
in
the
doorway
and
looked
at
her
without
recognition
i
am
sorry
he
said
you
have
a
visitor
come
in
said
mann
i
am
awfully
glad
you
called
the
girl
had
risen
to
her
feet
and
was
shrinking
back
to
the
wall
do
you
know
this
lady
frank
looked
at
her
keenly
why
yes
that
sergeant
smith
daughter
he
said
and
he
smiled
where
on
earth
have
you
been
do
touch
me
she
breathed
and
put
her
hands
before
her
warding
him
off
he
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
and
from
her
to
mann
then
he
looked
back
at
the
girl
his
brow
wrinkled
in
perplexity
this
girl
said
mann
thinks
she
is
your
wife
my
wife
said
frank
and
looked
again
at
her
is
this
a
bad
joke
or
something
do
you
say
that
i
am
your
husband
he
asked
she
did
not
speak
but
nodded
slowly
he
sat
down
in
a
chair
and
whistled
this
rather
complicates
matters
he
said
blankly
but
perhaps
you
can
explain
i
only
know
what
the
girl
has
told
me
said
mann
shaking
his
head
i
am
afraid
there
is
a
terrible
mistake
here
frank
turned
to
the
girl
but
did
your
husband
look
like
me
she
nodded
and
did
he
call
himself
frank
merrill
again
she
nodded
where
is
he
now
she
nodded
this
time
at
him
but
great
heavens
said
frank
with
a
gesture
of
despair
you
do
not
suggest
that
i
am
the
man
you
are
the
man
said
the
girl
again
frank
looked
appealingly
at
his
friend
and
saul
arthur
mann
saw
dismay
and
laughter
in
his
eyes
i
do
know
what
i
can
do
he
said
perhaps
if
you
left
me
alone
with
her
for
a
minute
do
do
she
breathed
do
leave
me
alone
with
him
stay
here
and
where
have
you
come
from
now
asked
frank
from
the
house
where
you
took
me
you
struck
me
yesterday
she
went
on
inconsequently
frank
laughed
i
am
not
only
married
but
i
am
a
wife
beater
apparently
he
said
desperately
now
what
can
i
do
i
think
the
best
thing
that
can
be
done
is
for
this
lady
to
tell
us
where
she
lives
and
i
will
take
her
back
and
confront
her
husband
i
wo
go
with
you
cried
the
girl
i
wo
i
wo
you
said
look
after
me
mann
you
promised
the
little
investigator
saw
that
she
was
distraught
to
a
point
where
a
collapse
was
imminent
this
gentleman
will
look
after
you
also
he
said
encouragingly
he
is
as
anxious
to
save
you
from
your
husband
as
anybody
i
will
not
go
she
cried
if
that
man
touches
me
and
she
pointed
to
frank
i
scream
again
came
the
tap
at
the
door
and
frank
looked
round
more
visitors
he
asked
it
is
all
right
said
saul
arthur
mann
there
a
lady
and
a
gentleman
to
see
me
is
there
he
asked
the
commissionaire
show
them
in
may
came
first
saw
the
little
tableau
and
stopped
knowing
instinctively
all
that
it
portended
jasper
followed
her
the
girl
who
had
been
watching
frank
shifted
her
eyes
for
a
moment
to
the
visitors
and
at
sight
of
jasper
flung
across
the
room
in
an
instant
her
brother
arms
were
around
her
and
she
was
sobbing
on
his
breast
am
i
entitled
to
ask
what
all
this
means
asked
frank
quietly
i
am
sure
you
will
overlook
my
natural
irritation
but
i
have
suffered
so
much
and
i
have
been
the
victim
of
so
many
surprises
that
i
do
not
feel
inclined
to
accept
all
the
shocks
which
fate
sends
me
in
a
spirit
of
joyful
resignation
perhaps
you
will
be
good
enough
to
elucidate
this
new
mystery
is
everybody
mad
or
am
i
the
sole
sufferer
there
is
no
mystery
about
it
said
jasper
still
holding
the
girl
i
think
you
know
this
lady
i
have
never
met
her
before
in
my
life
said
frank
but
she
persists
in
regarding
me
as
her
husband
for
some
reason
is
this
a
new
scheme
of
yours
jasper
i
think
you
know
this
lady
said
jasper
cole
again
frank
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
are
almost
monotonous
i
repeat
that
i
have
never
seen
her
before
then
i
will
explain
to
you
said
jasper
he
put
the
girl
gently
from
him
for
a
moment
and
turned
and
whispered
something
to
may
together
they
passed
out
of
the
room
you
were
confidential
secretary
to
john
minute
for
some
time
merrill
and
in
that
capacity
you
made
several
discoveries
the
most
remarkable
discovery
was
made
when
sergeant
smith
came
to
blackmail
my
father
oh
do
pretend
you
did
know
that
john
minute
was
my
father
he
said
in
answer
to
the
look
of
amazement
on
frank
merrill
face
smith
took
you
into
his
confidence
and
you
married
his
alleged
daughter
john
minute
discovered
this
fact
not
that
he
was
aware
that
it
was
his
own
daughter
or
that
he
thought
that
your
association
with
my
sister
was
any
more
than
an
intrigue
beneath
the
dignity
of
his
nephew
you
did
not
think
the
time
was
ripe
to
spring
a
upon
him
and
so
you
waited
until
you
had
seen
his
will
in
that
will
he
made
no
mention
of
a
daughter
because
the
child
had
been
born
after
his
wife
had
left
him
and
he
refused
to
recognize
his
paternity
later
in
some
doubt
as
to
whether
he
was
doing
an
injustice
to
what
might
have
been
his
own
child
he
endeavored
to
find
her
had
you
known
of
those
investigations
you
could
have
helped
considerably
but
as
it
happened
you
did
not
you
married
her
because
you
thought
you
would
get
a
share
of
john
minute
millions
and
when
you
found
your
plan
had
miscarried
you
planned
an
act
of
bigamy
in
order
to
secure
a
portion
of
mr
minute
fortune
which
you
knew
would
be
considerable
he
turned
to
saul
arthur
mann
you
think
i
have
not
been
very
energetic
in
pursuing
my
inquiries
as
to
who
killed
john
minute
there
is
the
explanation
of
my
tolerance
he
pointed
his
finger
at
frank
this
man
is
the
husband
of
my
sister
to
ruin
him
would
have
meant
involving
her
in
that
ruin
for
a
time
i
thought
they
were
happily
married
it
was
only
recently
that
i
have
discovered
the
truth
frank
shook
his
head
i
do
know
whether
to
laugh
or
cry
he
said
i
have
certainly
not
heard
you
will
hear
more
said
jasper
cole
i
will
tell
you
how
the
murder
was
committed
and
who
was
the
mysterious
rex
holland
your
father
was
a
forger
that
is
known
you
also
have
been
forging
signatures
since
you
were
a
boy
you
were
rex
holland
you
came
to
eastbourne
on
the
night
of
the
murder
and
by
an
ingenious
device
you
secured
evidence
in
your
favor
in
advance
pretending
to
have
lost
your
ticket
you
allowed
station
officials
to
search
you
and
to
testify
that
you
had
no
weapon
you
were
dropped
at
the
gate
of
my
father
house
and
as
soon
as
the
cab
driver
had
disappeared
you
made
your
way
to
where
you
had
hidden
your
car
in
a
field
at
a
short
distance
from
the
house
you
had
arrived
there
earlier
in
the
evening
and
had
made
your
way
across
the
metals
to
polegate
junction
where
you
joined
the
train
as
you
had
taken
the
precaution
to
have
your
return
ticket
clipped
in
london
your
trick
was
not
discovered
you
had
regained
your
car
and
drove
up
to
the
house
ten
minutes
after
you
had
been
seen
to
disappear
through
the
gateway
from
your
car
you
had
taken
the
revolver
and
with
that
revolver
you
murdered
my
father
in
order
to
shield
yourself
you
threw
suspicion
on
me
and
made
friends
with
one
of
the
shrewdest
men
he
inclined
his
head
toward
the
speechless
mann
and
through
him
conveyed
those
suspicions
to
authoritative
quarters
it
was
you
who
having
said
farewell
to
miss
nuttall
in
geneva
reappeared
the
same
evening
at
montreux
and
wrote
a
note
forging
my
handwriting
it
was
you
who
left
a
torn
sheet
of
paper
in
the
room
at
number
flowerton
road
also
in
your
writing
you
have
never
moved
a
step
but
that
i
have
followed
you
my
agents
have
been
with
you
day
and
night
ever
since
the
day
of
the
murder
i
have
waited
my
time
and
that
has
come
now
frank
heaved
a
long
sigh
and
took
up
his
hat
morning
i
shall
have
a
story
to
tell
he
said
you
are
an
excellent
actor
said
jasper
and
an
excellent
liar
but
you
have
never
deceived
me
he
flung
open
the
door
there
is
your
road
you
have
twenty
thousand
pounds
which
my
father
left
you
you
have
some
thousand
pounds
which
you
buried
on
the
night
of
the
murder
you
remember
the
gardener
trowel
in
the
car
he
said
turning
to
mann
i
give
you
hours
to
leave
england
we
can
not
try
you
for
the
murder
of
john
minute
you
can
still
be
tried
for
the
murder
of
your
unfortunate
servants
frank
merrill
made
no
movement
toward
the
door
he
walked
over
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
stood
with
his
back
to
them
then
he
turned
sometimes
he
said
i
feel
that
it
is
worth
while
going
on
it
has
been
rather
a
strain
all
this
jasper
cole
sprang
toward
him
and
caught
him
as
he
fell
they
laid
him
down
and
saul
arthur
mann
called
urgently
on
the
telephone
for
a
doctor
but
frank
merrill
was
dead
i
knew
said
constable
wiseman
when
the
story
came
to
him
the
end
