by

the
strangest
stories
ever
written
the
tale
of
a
barbarian
adventurer
a
woman
pirate
and
a
weird
roofed
city
inhabited
by
the
most
peculiar
race
of
men
ever
nearly
four
years
ago
weird
tales
published
a
story
called
the
phoenix
on
the
sword
built
around
a
barbarian
adventurer
named
conan
who
had
become
king
of
a
country
by
sheer
force
of
valor
and
brute
strength
the
author
of
that
story
was
robert
howard
who
was
already
a
favorite
with
the
readers
of
this
magazine
for
his
stories
of
solomon
kane
the
dour
english
puritan
and
redresser
of
wrongs
the
stories
about
conan
were
speedily
acclaimed
by
our
readers
and
the
barbarian
weird
adventures
became
immensely
popular
the
story
presented
herewith
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
and
eery
weird
tales
yet
written
about
conan
we
commend
this
story
to
you
for
we
know
you
will
enjoy
it
through
and
through
the
skull
on
the
the
woman
on
the
horse
reined
in
her
weary
steed
it
stood
with
its
legs
its
head
drooping
as
if
it
found
even
the
weight
of
the
bridle
too
heavy
the
woman
drew
a
booted
foot
out
of
the
silver
stirrup
and
swung
down
from
the
saddle
she
made
the
reins
fast
to
the
fork
of
a
sapling
and
turned
about
hands
on
her
hips
to
survey
her
surroundings
they
were
not
inviting
giant
trees
hemmed
in
the
small
pool
where
her
horse
had
just
drunk
clumps
of
undergrowth
limited
the
vision
that
quested
under
the
somber
twilight
of
the
lofty
arches
formed
by
intertwining
branches
the
woman
shivered
with
a
twitch
of
her
magnificent
shoulders
and
then
cursed
she
was
tall
and
with
compact
shoulders
her
whole
figure
reflected
an
unusual
strength
without
detracting
from
the
femininity
of
her
appearance
she
was
all
woman
in
spite
of
her
bearing
and
her
garments
the
latter
were
incongruous
in
view
of
her
present
environs
instead
of
a
skirt
she
wore
short
silk
breeches
which
ceased
a
hand
breadth
short
of
her
knees
and
were
upheld
by
a
wide
silken
sash
worn
as
a
girdle
boots
of
soft
leather
came
almost
to
her
knees
and
a
silk
shirt
completed
her
costume
on
one
shapely
hip
she
wore
a
straight
sword
and
on
the
other
a
long
dirk
her
unruly
golden
hair
cut
square
at
her
shoulders
was
confined
by
a
band
of
crimson
satin
against
the
background
of
somber
primitive
forest
she
posed
with
an
unconscious
picturesqueness
bizarre
and
out
of
place
she
should
have
been
posed
against
a
background
of
painted
masts
and
wheeling
gulls
there
was
the
color
of
the
sea
in
her
wide
eyes
and
that
was
as
it
should
have
been
because
this
was
valeria
of
the
red
brotherhood
whose
deeds
are
celebrated
in
song
and
ballad
wherever
seafarers
gather
illustration
convinced
that
his
death
was
upon
him
the
cimmerian
acted
according
to
his
instinct
she
strove
to
pierce
the
sullen
green
roof
of
the
arched
branches
and
see
the
sky
which
presumably
lay
about
it
but
presently
gave
it
up
with
a
muttered
oath
leaving
her
horse
tied
she
strode
off
toward
the
east
glancing
back
toward
the
pool
from
time
to
time
in
order
to
fix
her
route
in
her
mind
the
silence
of
the
forest
depressed
her
no
birds
sang
in
the
lofty
boughs
nor
did
any
rustling
in
the
bushes
indicate
the
presence
of
any
small
animals
for
leagues
she
had
traveled
in
a
realm
of
brooding
stillness
broken
only
by
the
sounds
of
her
own
flight
she
had
slaked
her
thirst
at
the
pool
but
she
felt
the
gnawings
of
hunger
and
began
looking
about
for
some
of
the
fruit
on
which
she
had
sustained
herself
since
exhausting
the
food
she
had
brought
in
her
ahead
of
her
presently
she
saw
an
outcropping
of
dark
rock
that
sloped
upward
into
what
looked
like
a
rugged
crag
rising
among
the
trees
its
summit
was
lost
to
view
amidst
a
cloud
of
encircling
leaves
perhaps
its
peak
rose
above
the
and
from
it
she
could
see
what
lay
beyond
if
indeed
anything
lay
beyond
but
more
of
this
apparently
illimitable
forest
through
which
she
had
ridden
for
so
many
days
a
narrow
ridge
formed
a
natural
ramp
that
led
up
the
steep
face
of
the
crag
after
she
had
ascended
some
fifty
feet
she
came
to
the
belt
of
leaves
that
surrounded
the
rock
the
trunks
of
the
trees
did
not
crowd
close
to
the
crag
but
the
ends
of
their
lower
branches
extended
about
it
veiling
it
with
their
foliage
she
groped
on
in
leafy
obscurity
not
able
to
see
either
above
or
below
her
but
presently
she
glimpsed
blue
sky
and
a
moment
later
came
out
in
the
clear
hot
sunlight
and
saw
the
forest
roof
stretching
away
under
her
feet
she
was
standing
on
a
broad
shelf
which
was
about
even
with
the
and
from
it
rose
a
jut
that
was
the
ultimate
peak
of
the
crag
she
had
climbed
but
something
else
caught
her
attention
at
the
moment
her
foot
had
struck
something
in
the
litter
of
blown
dead
leaves
which
carpeted
the
shelf
she
kicked
them
aside
and
looked
down
on
the
skeleton
of
a
man
she
ran
an
experienced
eye
over
the
bleached
frame
but
saw
no
broken
bones
nor
any
sign
of
violence
the
man
must
have
died
a
natural
death
though
why
he
should
have
climbed
a
tall
crag
to
die
she
could
not
imagine
she
scrambled
up
to
the
summit
of
the
spire
and
looked
toward
the
horizons
the
forest
roof
which
looked
like
a
floor
from
her
was
just
as
impenetrable
as
from
below
she
could
not
even
see
the
pool
by
which
she
had
left
her
horse
she
glanced
northward
in
the
direction
from
which
she
had
come
she
saw
only
the
rolling
green
ocean
stretching
away
and
away
with
only
a
vague
blue
line
in
the
distance
to
hint
of
the
she
had
crossed
days
before
to
plunge
into
this
leafy
waste
west
and
east
the
view
was
the
same
though
the
blue
was
lacking
in
those
directions
but
when
she
turned
her
eyes
southward
she
stiffened
and
caught
her
breath
a
mile
away
in
that
direction
the
forest
thinned
out
and
ceased
abruptly
giving
way
to
a
plain
and
in
the
midst
of
that
plain
rose
the
walls
and
towers
of
a
city
valeria
swore
in
amazement
this
passed
belief
she
would
not
have
been
surprised
to
sight
human
habitations
of
another
sort
the
huts
of
the
black
people
or
the
of
the
mysterious
brown
race
which
legends
declared
inhabited
some
country
of
this
unexplored
region
but
it
was
a
startling
experience
to
come
upon
a
walled
city
here
so
many
long
weeks
march
from
the
nearest
outposts
of
any
sort
of
civilization
her
hands
tiring
from
clinging
to
the
pinnacle
she
let
herself
down
on
the
shelf
frowning
in
indecision
she
had
come
far
from
the
camp
of
the
mercenaries
by
the
border
town
of
sukhmet
amidst
the
level
grasslands
where
desperate
adventurers
of
many
races
guard
the
stygian
frontier
against
the
raids
that
come
up
like
a
red
wave
from
darfar
her
flight
had
been
blind
into
a
country
of
which
she
was
wholly
ignorant
and
now
she
wavered
between
an
urge
to
ride
directly
to
that
city
in
the
plain
and
the
instinct
of
caution
which
prompted
her
to
skirt
it
widely
and
continue
her
solitary
flight
her
thoughts
were
scattered
by
the
rustling
of
the
leaves
below
her
she
wheeled
snatched
at
her
sword
and
then
she
froze
motionless
staring
at
the
man
before
her
he
was
almost
a
giant
in
stature
muscles
rippling
smoothly
under
his
skin
which
the
sun
had
burned
brown
his
garb
was
similar
to
hers
except
that
he
wore
a
broad
leather
belt
instead
of
a
girdle
broadsword
and
poniard
hung
from
this
belt
conan
the
cimmerian
ejaculated
the
woman
what
are
doing
on
my
trail
he
grinned
hardly
and
his
fierce
blue
eyes
burned
with
a
light
any
woman
could
understand
as
they
ran
over
her
magnificent
figure
lingering
on
the
swell
of
her
splendid
breasts
beneath
the
light
shirt
and
the
clear
white
flesh
displayed
between
breeches
and
do
you
know
he
laughed
have
i
made
my
admiration
for
you
plain
ever
since
i
first
saw
you
a
stallion
could
have
made
it
no
plainer
she
answered
disdainfully
but
i
never
expected
to
encounter
you
so
far
from
the
and
of
sukhmet
did
you
really
follow
me
from
zarallo
camp
or
were
you
whipped
forth
for
a
rogue
he
laughed
at
her
insolence
and
flexed
his
mighty
biceps
you
know
zarallo
did
have
enough
knaves
to
whip
me
out
of
camp
he
grinned
of
course
i
followed
you
lucky
thing
for
you
too
wench
when
you
knifed
that
stygian
officer
you
forfeited
zarallo
favor
and
protection
and
you
outlawed
yourself
with
the
stygians
i
know
it
she
replied
sullenly
but
what
else
could
i
do
you
know
what
my
provocation
was
sure
he
agreed
if
i
been
there
i
have
knifed
him
myself
but
if
a
woman
must
live
in
the
of
men
she
can
expect
such
things
valeria
stamped
her
booted
foot
and
swore
why
wo
men
let
me
live
a
man
life
that
obvious
again
his
eager
eyes
devoured
her
but
you
were
wise
to
run
away
the
stygians
would
have
had
you
skinned
that
brother
followed
you
faster
than
you
thought
i
do
doubt
he
far
behind
you
when
i
caught
up
with
him
his
horse
was
better
than
yours
he
have
caught
you
and
cut
your
throat
within
a
few
more
miles
well
she
demanded
well
what
he
seemed
puzzled
what
of
the
stygian
why
what
do
you
suppose
he
returned
impatiently
i
killed
him
of
course
and
left
his
carcass
for
the
vultures
that
delayed
me
though
and
i
almost
lost
your
trail
when
you
crossed
the
rocky
spurs
of
the
hills
otherwise
i
have
caught
up
with
you
long
ago
and
now
you
think
you
drag
me
back
to
zarallo
camp
she
sneered
do
talk
like
a
fool
he
grunted
come
girl
do
be
such
a
spitfire
i
not
like
that
stygian
you
knifed
and
you
know
it
a
penniless
vagabond
she
taunted
he
laughed
at
her
what
do
you
call
yourself
you
have
enough
money
to
buy
a
new
seat
for
your
breeches
your
disdain
does
deceive
me
you
know
commanded
bigger
ships
and
more
men
than
you
ever
did
in
your
life
as
for
being
penniless
what
rover
is
most
of
the
time
i
squandered
enough
gold
in
the
of
the
world
to
fill
a
galleon
you
know
that
too
where
are
the
fine
ships
and
the
bold
lads
you
commanded
now
she
sneered
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
mostly
he
replied
cheerfully
the
zingarans
sank
my
last
ship
off
the
shemite
shore
that
why
i
joined
zarallo
free
companions
but
i
saw
i
been
stung
when
we
marched
to
the
darfar
border
the
pay
was
poor
and
the
wine
was
sour
and
i
like
black
women
and
that
the
only
kind
that
came
to
our
camp
at
sukhmet
rings
in
their
noses
and
their
teeth
filed
bah
why
did
you
join
zarallo
sukhmet
a
long
way
from
salt
water
red
ortho
wanted
to
make
me
his
mistress
she
answered
sullenly
i
jumped
overboard
one
night
and
swam
ashore
when
we
were
anchored
off
the
kushite
coast
off
zabhela
it
was
there
a
shemite
trader
told
me
that
zarallo
had
brought
his
free
companies
south
to
guard
the
darfar
border
no
better
employment
offered
i
joined
an
caravan
and
eventually
came
to
sukhmet
it
was
madness
to
plunge
southward
as
you
did
commented
conan
but
it
was
wise
too
for
zarallo
patrols
never
thought
to
look
for
you
in
this
direction
only
the
brother
of
the
man
you
killed
happened
to
strike
your
trail
and
now
what
do
you
intend
doing
she
demanded
turn
west
he
answered
i
been
this
far
south
but
not
this
far
east
many
days
traveling
to
the
west
will
bring
us
to
the
open
savannas
where
the
black
tribes
graze
their
cattle
i
have
friends
among
them
we
get
to
the
coast
and
find
a
ship
i
sick
of
the
jungle
then
be
on
your
way
she
advised
i
have
other
plans
do
be
a
fool
he
showed
irritation
for
the
first
time
you
keep
on
wandering
through
this
forest
i
can
if
i
choose
but
what
do
you
intend
doing
that
none
of
your
affair
she
snapped
yes
it
is
he
answered
calmly
do
you
think
i
followed
you
this
far
to
turn
around
and
ride
off
be
sensible
wench
not
going
to
harm
you
he
stepped
toward
her
and
she
sprang
back
whipping
out
her
sword
keep
back
you
barbarian
dog
i
spit
you
like
a
roast
pig
he
halted
reluctantly
and
demanded
do
you
want
me
to
take
that
toy
away
from
you
and
spank
you
with
it
words
nothing
but
words
she
mocked
lights
like
the
gleam
of
the
sun
on
blue
water
dancing
in
her
reckless
eyes
he
knew
it
was
the
truth
no
living
man
could
disarm
valeria
of
the
brotherhood
with
his
bare
hands
he
scowled
his
sensations
a
tangle
of
conflicting
emotions
he
was
angry
yet
he
was
amused
and
filled
with
admiration
for
her
spirit
he
burned
with
eagerness
to
seize
that
splendid
figure
and
crush
it
in
his
iron
arms
yet
he
greatly
desired
not
to
hurt
the
girl
he
was
torn
between
a
desire
to
shake
her
soundly
and
a
desire
to
caress
her
he
knew
if
he
came
any
nearer
her
sword
would
be
sheathed
in
his
heart
he
had
seen
valeria
kill
too
many
men
in
border
forays
and
tavern
brawls
to
have
any
illusions
about
her
he
knew
she
was
as
quick
and
ferocious
as
a
tigress
he
could
draw
his
broadsword
and
disarm
her
beat
the
blade
out
of
her
hand
but
the
thought
of
drawing
a
sword
on
a
woman
even
without
intent
of
injury
was
extremely
repugnant
to
him
blast
your
soul
you
hussy
he
exclaimed
in
exasperation
i
going
to
take
off
your
he
started
toward
her
his
angry
passion
making
him
reckless
and
she
poised
herself
for
a
deadly
thrust
then
came
a
startling
interruption
to
a
scene
at
once
ludicrous
and
perilous
that
it
was
valeria
who
exclaimed
but
they
both
started
violently
and
conan
wheeled
like
a
cat
his
great
sword
flashing
into
his
hand
back
in
the
forest
had
burst
forth
an
appalling
medley
of
screams
the
screams
of
horses
in
terror
and
agony
mingled
with
their
screams
there
came
the
snap
of
splintering
bones
lions
are
slaying
the
horses
cried
valeria
lions
nothing
snorted
conan
his
eyes
blazing
did
you
hear
a
lion
roar
neither
did
i
listen
at
those
bones
snap
not
even
a
lion
could
make
that
much
noise
killing
a
horse
he
hurried
down
the
natural
ramp
and
she
followed
their
personal
feud
forgotten
in
the
adventurers
instinct
to
unite
against
common
peril
the
screams
had
ceased
when
they
worked
their
way
downward
through
the
green
veil
of
leaves
that
brushed
the
rock
i
found
your
horse
tied
by
the
pool
back
there
he
muttered
treading
so
noiselessly
that
she
no
longer
wondered
how
he
had
surprised
her
on
the
crag
i
tied
mine
beside
it
and
followed
the
tracks
of
your
boots
watch
now
they
had
emerged
from
the
belt
of
leaves
and
stared
down
into
the
lower
reaches
of
the
forest
above
them
the
green
roof
spread
its
dusky
canopy
below
them
the
sunlight
filtered
in
just
enough
to
make
a
twilight
the
giant
trunks
of
trees
less
than
a
hundred
yards
away
looked
dim
and
ghostly
the
horses
should
be
beyond
that
thicket
over
there
whispered
conan
and
his
voice
might
have
been
a
breeze
moving
through
the
branches
listen
valeria
had
already
heard
and
a
chill
crept
through
her
veins
so
she
unconsciously
laid
her
white
hand
on
her
companion
muscular
brown
arm
from
beyond
the
thicket
came
the
noisy
crunching
of
bones
and
the
loud
rending
of
flesh
together
with
the
grinding
slobbering
sounds
of
a
horrible
feast
lions
would
make
that
noise
whispered
conan
something
eating
our
horses
but
it
not
a
lion
crom
the
noise
stopped
suddenly
and
conan
swore
softly
a
suddenly
risen
breeze
was
blowing
from
them
directly
toward
the
spot
where
the
unseen
slayer
was
hidden
here
it
comes
muttered
conan
half
lifting
his
sword
the
thicket
was
violently
agitated
and
valeria
clutched
conan
arm
hard
ignorant
of
she
yet
knew
that
no
animal
she
had
ever
seen
could
have
shaken
the
tall
brush
like
that
it
must
be
as
big
as
an
elephant
muttered
conan
echoing
her
thought
what
the
devil
his
voice
trailed
away
in
stunned
silence
through
the
thicket
was
thrust
a
head
of
nightmare
and
lunacy
grinning
jaws
bared
rows
of
dripping
yellow
tusks
above
the
yawning
mouth
wrinkled
a
snout
huge
eyes
like
those
of
a
python
a
thousand
times
magnified
stared
unwinkingly
at
the
petrified
humans
clinging
to
the
rock
above
it
blood
smeared
the
scaly
flabby
lips
and
dripped
from
the
huge
mouth
the
head
bigger
than
that
of
a
crocodile
was
further
extended
on
a
long
scaled
neck
on
which
stood
up
rows
of
serrated
spikes
and
after
it
crushing
down
the
briars
and
saplings
waddled
the
body
of
a
titan
a
gigantic
torso
on
absurdly
short
legs
the
whitish
belly
almost
raked
the
ground
while
the
serrated
rose
higher
than
conan
could
have
reached
on
tiptoe
a
long
spiked
tail
like
that
of
a
gargantuan
scorpion
trailed
out
behind
back
up
the
crag
quick
snapped
conan
thrusting
the
girl
behind
him
i
do
think
he
can
climb
but
he
can
stand
on
his
and
reach
us
with
a
snapping
and
rending
of
bushes
and
saplings
the
monster
came
hurtling
through
the
thickets
and
they
fled
up
the
rock
before
him
like
leaves
blown
before
a
wind
as
valeria
plunged
into
the
leafy
screen
a
backward
glance
showed
her
the
titan
rearing
up
fearsomely
on
his
massive
even
as
conan
had
predicted
the
sight
sent
panic
racing
through
her
as
he
reared
the
beast
seemed
more
gigantic
than
ever
his
snouted
head
towered
among
the
trees
then
conan
iron
hand
closed
on
her
wrist
and
she
was
jerked
headlong
into
the
blinding
welter
of
the
leaves
and
out
again
into
the
hot
sunshine
above
just
as
the
monster
fell
forward
with
his
front
feet
on
the
crag
with
an
impact
that
made
the
rock
vibrate
behind
the
fugitives
the
huge
head
crashed
through
the
twigs
and
they
looked
down
for
a
horrifying
instant
at
the
nightmare
visage
framed
among
the
green
leaves
eyes
flaming
jaws
gaping
then
the
giant
tusks
clashed
together
futilely
and
after
that
the
head
was
withdrawn
vanishing
from
their
sight
as
if
it
had
sunk
in
a
pool
peering
down
through
broken
branches
that
scraped
the
rock
they
saw
it
squatting
on
its
haunches
at
the
foot
of
the
crag
staring
unblinkingly
up
at
them
valeria
shuddered
how
long
do
you
suppose
he
crouch
there
conan
kicked
the
skull
on
the
shelf
that
fellow
must
have
climbed
up
here
to
escape
him
or
one
like
him
he
must
have
died
of
starvation
there
are
no
bones
broken
that
thing
must
be
a
dragon
such
as
the
black
people
speak
of
in
their
legends
if
so
it
wo
leave
here
until
we
both
dead
valeria
looked
at
him
blankly
her
resentment
forgotten
she
fought
down
a
surging
of
panic
she
had
proved
her
reckless
courage
a
thousand
times
in
wild
battles
on
sea
and
land
on
the
decks
of
burning
in
the
storming
of
walled
cities
and
on
the
trampled
sandy
beaches
where
the
desperate
men
of
the
red
brotherhood
bathed
their
knives
in
one
another
blood
in
their
fights
for
leadership
but
the
prospect
now
confronting
her
congealed
her
blood
a
in
the
heat
of
battle
was
nothing
but
to
sit
idle
and
helpless
on
a
bare
rock
until
she
perished
of
starvation
besieged
by
a
monstrous
survival
of
an
elder
age
the
thought
sent
panic
throbbing
through
her
brain
he
must
leave
to
eat
and
drink
she
said
helplessly
he
wo
have
to
go
far
to
do
either
conan
pointed
out
he
just
gorged
on
and
like
a
real
snake
he
can
go
for
a
long
time
without
eating
or
drinking
again
but
he
does
sleep
after
eating
like
a
real
snake
it
seems
anyway
he
ca
climb
this
crag
conan
spoke
imperturbably
he
was
a
barbarian
and
the
terrible
patience
of
the
wilderness
and
its
children
was
as
much
a
part
of
him
as
his
lusts
and
rages
he
could
endure
a
situation
like
this
with
a
coolness
impossible
to
a
civilized
person
ca
we
get
into
the
trees
and
get
away
traveling
like
apes
through
the
branches
she
asked
desperately
he
shook
his
head
i
thought
of
that
the
branches
that
touch
the
crag
down
there
are
too
light
they
break
with
our
weight
besides
i
have
an
idea
that
devil
could
tear
up
any
tree
around
here
by
its
roots
well
are
we
going
to
sit
here
on
our
rumps
until
we
starve
like
that
she
cried
furiously
kicking
the
skull
clattering
across
the
ledge
i
wo
do
it
i
go
down
there
and
cut
his
damned
head
off
conan
had
seated
himself
on
a
rocky
projection
at
the
foot
of
the
spire
he
looked
up
with
a
glint
of
admiration
at
her
blazing
eyes
and
tense
quivering
figure
but
realizing
that
she
was
in
just
the
mood
for
any
madness
he
let
none
of
his
admiration
sound
in
his
voice
sit
down
he
grunted
catching
her
by
her
wrist
and
pulling
her
down
on
his
knee
she
was
too
surprised
to
resist
as
he
took
her
sword
from
her
hand
and
shoved
it
back
in
its
sheath
sit
still
and
calm
down
you
only
break
your
steel
on
his
scales
he
gobble
you
up
at
one
gulp
or
smash
you
like
an
egg
with
that
spiked
tail
of
his
we
get
out
of
this
jam
some
way
but
we
sha
do
it
by
getting
chewed
up
and
swallowed
she
made
no
reply
nor
did
she
seek
to
repulse
his
arm
from
about
her
waist
she
was
frightened
and
the
sensation
was
new
to
valeria
of
the
red
brotherhood
so
she
sat
on
her
companion
or
captor
knee
with
a
docility
that
would
have
amazed
zarallo
who
had
anathematized
her
as
a
out
of
hell
seraglio
conan
played
idly
with
her
curly
yellow
locks
seemingly
intent
only
upon
his
conquest
neither
the
skeleton
at
his
feet
nor
the
monster
crouching
below
disturbed
his
mind
or
dulled
the
edge
of
his
interest
the
girl
restless
eyes
roving
the
leaves
below
them
discovered
splashes
of
color
among
the
green
it
was
fruit
large
darkly
crimson
globes
suspended
from
the
boughs
of
a
tree
whose
broad
leaves
were
a
peculiarly
rich
and
vivid
green
she
became
aware
of
both
thirst
and
hunger
though
thirst
had
not
assailed
her
until
she
knew
she
could
not
descend
from
the
crag
to
find
food
and
water
we
need
not
starve
she
said
there
is
fruit
we
can
reach
conan
glanced
where
she
pointed
if
we
ate
that
we
would
need
the
bite
of
a
dragon
he
grunted
that
what
the
black
people
of
kush
call
the
apples
of
derketa
derketa
is
the
queen
of
the
dead
drink
a
little
of
the
juice
or
spill
it
on
your
flesh
and
you
be
dead
before
you
could
tumble
to
the
foot
of
this
crag
oh
she
lapsed
into
dismayed
silence
there
seemed
no
way
out
of
their
predicament
she
reflected
gloomily
she
saw
no
way
of
escape
and
conan
seemed
to
be
concerned
only
with
her
supple
waist
and
curly
tresses
if
he
was
trying
to
formulate
a
plan
of
escape
he
did
not
show
it
if
you
take
your
hands
off
me
long
enough
to
climb
up
on
that
peak
she
said
presently
you
see
something
that
will
surprise
you
he
cast
her
a
questioning
glance
then
obeyed
with
a
shrug
of
his
massive
shoulders
clinging
to
the
pinnacle
he
stared
out
over
the
forest
roof
he
stood
a
long
moment
in
silence
posed
like
a
bronze
statue
on
the
rock
it
a
walled
city
right
enough
he
muttered
presently
was
that
where
you
were
going
when
you
tried
to
send
me
off
alone
to
the
coast
i
saw
it
before
you
came
i
knew
nothing
of
it
when
i
left
sukhmet
who
have
thought
to
find
a
city
here
i
do
believe
the
stygians
ever
penetrated
this
far
could
black
people
build
a
city
like
that
i
see
no
herds
on
the
plain
no
signs
of
cultivation
or
people
moving
about
how
could
you
hope
to
see
all
that
at
this
distance
she
demanded
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
dropped
down
on
the
shelf
well
the
folk
of
the
city
ca
help
us
just
now
and
they
might
not
if
they
could
the
people
of
the
black
countries
are
generally
hostile
to
strangers
probably
stick
us
full
of
spears
he
stopped
short
and
stood
silent
as
if
he
had
forgotten
what
he
was
saying
frowning
down
at
the
crimson
spheres
gleaming
among
the
leaves
spears
he
muttered
what
a
blasted
fool
i
am
not
to
have
thought
of
that
before
that
shows
what
a
pretty
woman
does
to
a
man
mind
what
are
you
talking
about
she
inquired
without
answering
her
question
he
descended
to
the
belt
of
leaves
and
looked
down
through
them
the
great
brute
squatted
below
watching
the
crag
with
the
frightful
patience
of
the
reptile
folk
so
might
one
of
his
breed
have
glared
up
at
their
troglodyte
ancestors
treed
on
a
rock
in
the
dim
dawn
ages
conan
cursed
him
without
heat
and
began
cutting
branches
reaching
out
and
severing
them
as
far
from
the
end
as
he
could
reach
the
agitation
of
the
leaves
made
the
monster
restless
he
rose
from
his
haunches
and
lashed
his
hideous
tail
snapping
off
saplings
as
if
they
had
been
toothpicks
conan
watched
him
warily
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
and
just
as
valeria
believed
the
dragon
was
about
to
hurl
himself
up
the
crag
again
the
cimmerian
drew
back
and
climbed
up
to
the
ledge
with
the
branches
he
had
cut
there
were
three
of
these
slender
shafts
about
seven
feet
long
but
not
larger
than
his
thumb
he
had
also
cut
several
strands
of
tough
thin
vine
branches
too
light
for
and
creepers
no
thicker
than
cords
he
remarked
indicating
the
foliage
about
the
crag
it
hold
our
weight
but
there
strength
in
union
that
what
the
aquilonian
renegades
used
to
tell
us
cimmerians
when
they
came
into
the
hills
to
raise
an
army
to
invade
their
own
country
but
we
always
fight
by
clans
and
tribes
what
the
devil
has
that
got
to
do
with
those
sticks
she
demanded
you
wait
and
see
gathering
the
sticks
in
a
compact
bundle
he
wedged
his
poniard
hilt
between
them
at
one
end
then
with
the
vines
he
bound
them
together
and
when
he
had
completed
his
task
he
had
a
spear
of
no
small
strength
with
a
sturdy
shaft
seven
feet
in
length
what
good
will
that
do
she
demanded
you
told
me
that
a
blade
could
pierce
his
scales
he
has
got
scales
all
over
him
answered
conan
there
more
than
one
way
of
skinning
a
panther
moving
down
to
the
edge
of
the
leaves
he
reached
the
spear
up
and
carefully
thrust
the
blade
through
one
of
the
apples
of
derketa
drawing
aside
to
avoid
the
darkly
purple
drops
that
dripped
from
the
pierced
fruit
presently
he
withdrew
the
blade
and
showed
her
the
blue
steel
stained
a
dull
purplish
crimson
i
do
know
whether
it
will
do
the
job
or
not
quoth
he
enough
poison
there
to
kill
an
elephant
but
well
we
see
valeria
was
close
behind
him
as
he
let
himself
down
among
the
leaves
cautiously
holding
the
poisoned
pike
away
from
him
he
thrust
his
head
through
the
branches
and
addressed
the
monster
what
are
you
waiting
down
there
for
you
misbegotten
offspring
of
questionable
parents
was
one
of
his
more
printable
queries
stick
your
ugly
head
up
here
again
you
brute
or
do
you
want
me
to
come
down
there
and
kick
you
loose
from
your
illegitimate
spine
there
was
more
of
it
some
of
it
couched
in
eloquence
that
made
valeria
stare
in
spite
of
her
profane
education
among
the
seafarers
and
it
had
its
effect
on
the
monster
just
as
the
incessant
yapping
of
a
dog
worries
and
enrages
more
constitutionally
silent
animals
so
the
clamorous
voice
of
a
man
rouses
fear
in
some
bestial
bosoms
and
insane
rage
in
others
suddenly
and
with
appalling
quickness
the
mastodonic
brute
reared
up
on
its
mighty
hind
legs
and
elongated
its
neck
and
body
in
a
furious
effort
to
reach
this
vociferous
pigmy
whose
clamor
was
disturbing
the
primeval
silence
of
its
ancient
realm
but
conan
had
judged
his
distance
with
precision
some
five
feet
below
him
the
mighty
head
crashed
terribly
but
futilely
through
the
leaves
and
as
the
monstrous
mouth
gaped
like
that
of
a
great
snake
conan
drove
his
spear
into
the
red
angle
of
the
hinge
he
struck
downward
with
all
the
strength
of
both
arms
driving
the
long
poniard
blade
to
the
hilt
in
flesh
sinew
and
bone
instantly
the
jaws
clashed
convulsively
together
severing
the
shaft
and
almost
precipitating
conan
from
his
perch
he
would
have
fallen
but
for
the
girl
behind
him
who
caught
his
in
a
desperate
grasp
he
clutched
at
a
rocky
projection
and
grinned
his
thanks
back
at
her
down
on
the
ground
the
monster
was
wallowing
like
a
dog
with
pepper
in
its
eyes
he
shook
his
head
from
side
to
side
pawed
at
it
and
opened
his
mouth
repeatedly
to
its
widest
extent
presently
he
got
a
huge
front
foot
on
the
stump
of
the
shaft
and
managed
to
tear
the
blade
out
then
he
threw
up
his
head
jaws
wide
and
spouting
blood
and
glared
up
at
the
crag
with
such
concentrated
and
intelligent
fury
that
valeria
trembled
and
drew
her
sword
the
scales
along
his
back
and
flanks
turned
from
rusty
brown
to
a
dull
lurid
red
most
horribly
the
monster
silence
was
broken
the
sounds
that
issued
from
his
jaws
did
not
sound
like
anything
that
could
have
been
produced
by
an
earthly
creation
with
harsh
grating
roars
the
dragon
hurled
himself
at
the
crag
that
was
the
citadel
of
his
enemies
again
and
again
his
mighty
head
crashed
upward
through
the
branches
snapping
vainly
on
empty
air
he
hurled
his
full
ponderous
weight
against
the
rock
until
it
vibrated
from
base
to
crest
and
rearing
upright
he
gripped
it
with
his
front
legs
like
a
man
and
tried
to
tear
it
up
by
the
roots
as
if
it
had
been
a
tree
this
exhibition
of
primordial
fury
chilled
the
blood
in
valeria
veins
but
conan
was
too
close
to
the
primitive
himself
to
feel
anything
but
a
comprehending
interest
to
the
barbarian
no
such
gulf
existed
between
himself
and
other
men
and
the
animals
as
existed
in
the
conception
of
valeria
the
monster
below
them
to
conan
was
merely
a
form
of
life
differing
from
himself
mainly
in
physical
shape
he
attributed
to
it
characteristics
similar
to
his
own
and
saw
in
its
wrath
a
counterpart
of
his
rages
in
its
roars
and
bellowings
merely
reptilian
equivalents
to
the
curses
he
had
bestowed
upon
it
feeling
a
kinship
with
all
wild
things
even
dragons
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
experience
the
sick
horror
which
assailed
valeria
at
the
sight
of
the
brute
ferocity
he
sat
watching
it
tranquilly
and
pointed
out
the
various
changes
that
were
taking
place
in
its
voice
and
actions
the
poison
taking
hold
he
said
with
conviction
i
do
believe
it
to
valeria
it
seemed
preposterous
to
suppose
that
anything
however
lethal
could
have
any
effect
on
that
mountain
of
muscle
and
fury
there
pain
in
his
voice
declared
conan
first
he
was
merely
angry
because
of
the
stinging
in
his
jaw
now
he
feels
the
bite
of
the
poison
look
he
staggering
he
be
blind
in
a
few
more
minutes
what
did
i
tell
you
for
suddenly
the
dragon
had
lurched
about
and
went
crashing
off
through
the
bushes
is
he
running
away
inquired
valeria
uneasily
he
making
for
the
pool
conan
sprang
up
galvanized
into
swift
activity
the
poison
makes
him
thirsty
come
on
he
be
blind
in
a
few
moments
but
he
can
smell
his
way
back
to
the
foot
of
the
crag
and
if
our
scent
here
still
he
sit
there
until
he
dies
and
others
of
his
kind
may
come
at
his
cries
let
go
down
there
valeria
was
aghast
sure
we
make
for
the
city
they
may
cut
our
heads
off
there
but
it
our
only
chance
we
may
run
into
a
thousand
more
dragons
on
the
way
but
it
sure
death
to
stay
here
if
we
wait
until
he
dies
we
may
have
a
dozen
more
to
deal
with
after
me
in
a
hurry
he
went
down
the
ramp
as
swiftly
as
an
ape
pausing
only
to
aid
his
less
agile
companion
who
until
she
saw
the
cimmerian
climb
had
fancied
herself
the
equal
of
any
man
in
the
rigging
of
a
ship
or
on
the
sheer
face
of
a
cliff
they
descended
into
the
gloom
below
the
branches
and
slid
to
the
ground
silently
though
valeria
felt
as
if
the
pounding
of
her
heart
must
surely
be
heard
from
far
away
a
noisy
gurgling
and
lapping
beyond
the
dense
thicket
indicated
that
the
dragon
was
drinking
at
the
pool
as
soon
as
his
belly
is
full
he
be
back
muttered
conan
it
may
take
hours
for
the
poison
to
kill
him
if
it
does
at
all
somewhere
beyond
the
forest
the
sun
was
sinking
to
the
horizon
the
forest
was
a
misty
twilight
place
of
black
shadows
and
dim
vistas
conan
gripped
valeria
wrist
and
glided
away
from
the
foot
of
the
crag
he
made
less
noise
than
a
breeze
blowing
among
the
but
valeria
felt
as
if
her
soft
boots
were
betraying
their
flight
to
all
the
forest
i
do
think
he
can
follow
a
trail
muttered
conan
but
if
a
wind
blew
our
to
him
he
could
smell
us
out
mitra
grant
that
the
wind
blow
not
valeria
breathed
her
face
was
a
pallid
oval
in
the
gloom
she
gripped
her
sword
in
her
free
hand
but
the
feel
of
the
hilt
inspired
only
a
feeling
of
helplessness
in
her
they
were
still
some
distance
from
the
edge
of
the
forest
when
they
heard
a
snapping
and
crashing
behind
them
valeria
bit
her
lip
to
check
a
cry
he
on
our
trail
she
whispered
fiercely
conan
shook
his
head
he
did
smell
us
at
the
rock
and
he
blundering
about
through
the
forest
trying
to
pick
up
our
scent
come
on
it
the
city
or
nothing
now
he
could
tear
down
any
tree
we
climb
if
only
the
wind
stays
down
they
stole
on
until
the
trees
began
to
thin
out
ahead
of
them
behind
them
the
forest
was
a
black
impenetrable
ocean
of
shadows
the
ominous
crackling
still
sounded
behind
them
as
the
dragon
blundered
in
his
erratic
course
there
the
plain
ahead
breathed
valeria
a
little
more
and
we
crom
swore
conan
mitra
whispered
valeria
out
of
the
south
a
wind
had
sprung
up
it
blew
over
them
directly
into
the
black
forest
behind
them
instantly
a
horrible
roar
shook
the
woods
the
aimless
snapping
and
crackling
of
the
bushes
changed
to
a
sustained
crashing
as
the
dragon
came
like
a
hurricane
straight
toward
the
spot
from
which
the
scent
of
his
enemies
was
wafted
run
snarled
conan
his
eyes
blazing
like
those
of
a
trapped
wolf
it
all
we
can
do
sailor
boots
are
not
made
for
sprinting
and
the
life
of
a
pirate
does
not
train
one
for
a
runner
within
a
hundred
yards
valeria
was
panting
and
reeling
in
her
gait
and
behind
them
the
crashing
gave
way
to
a
rolling
thunder
as
the
monster
broke
out
of
the
thickets
and
into
the
more
open
ground
conan
iron
arm
about
the
woman
waist
half
lifted
her
her
feet
scarcely
touched
the
earth
as
she
was
borne
along
at
a
speed
she
could
never
have
attained
herself
if
he
could
keep
out
of
the
beast
way
for
a
bit
perhaps
that
betraying
wind
would
shift
but
the
wind
held
and
a
quick
glance
over
his
shoulder
showed
conan
that
the
monster
was
almost
upon
them
coming
like
a
in
front
of
a
hurricane
he
thrust
valeria
from
him
with
a
force
that
sent
her
reeling
a
dozen
feet
to
fall
in
a
crumpled
heap
at
the
foot
of
the
nearest
tree
and
the
cimmerian
wheeled
in
the
path
of
the
thundering
titan
convinced
that
his
death
was
upon
him
the
cimmerian
acted
according
to
his
instinct
and
hurled
himself
full
at
the
awful
face
that
was
bearing
down
on
him
he
leaped
slashing
like
a
wildcat
felt
his
sword
cut
deep
into
the
scales
that
sheathed
the
mighty
snout
and
then
a
terrific
impact
knocked
him
rolling
and
tumbling
for
fifty
feet
with
all
the
wind
and
half
the
life
battered
out
of
him
how
the
stunned
cimmerian
regained
his
feet
not
even
he
could
have
ever
told
but
the
only
thought
that
filled
his
brain
was
of
the
woman
lying
dazed
and
helpless
almost
in
the
path
of
the
hurtling
fiend
and
before
the
breath
came
whistling
back
into
his
gullet
he
was
standing
over
her
with
his
sword
in
his
hand
she
lay
where
he
had
thrown
her
but
she
was
struggling
to
a
sitting
posture
neither
tearing
tusks
nor
trampling
feet
had
touched
her
it
had
been
a
shoulder
or
front
leg
that
struck
conan
and
the
blind
monster
rushed
on
forgetting
the
victims
whose
scent
it
had
been
following
in
the
sudden
agony
of
its
death
throes
headlong
on
its
course
it
thundered
until
its
head
crashed
into
a
gigantic
tree
in
its
path
the
impact
tore
the
tree
up
by
the
roots
and
must
have
dashed
the
brains
from
the
misshapen
skull
tree
and
monster
fell
together
and
the
dazed
humans
saw
the
branches
and
leaves
shaken
by
the
convulsions
of
the
creature
they
covered
and
then
grow
quiet
conan
lifted
valeria
to
her
feet
and
together
they
started
away
at
a
reeling
run
a
few
moments
later
they
emerged
into
the
still
twilight
of
the
treeless
plain
conan
paused
an
instant
and
glanced
back
at
the
ebon
fastness
behind
them
not
a
leaf
stirred
nor
a
bird
chirped
it
stood
as
silent
as
it
must
have
stood
before
man
was
created
come
on
muttered
conan
taking
his
companion
hand
it
touch
and
go
now
if
more
dragons
come
out
of
the
woods
after
us
he
did
not
have
to
finish
the
sentence
the
city
looked
very
far
away
across
the
plain
farther
than
it
had
looked
from
the
crag
valeria
heart
hammered
until
she
felt
as
if
it
would
strangle
her
at
every
step
she
expected
to
hear
the
crashing
of
the
bushes
and
see
another
colossal
nightmare
bearing
down
upon
them
but
nothing
disturbed
the
silence
of
the
thickets
with
the
first
mile
between
them
and
the
woods
valeria
breathed
more
easily
her
buoyant
began
to
thaw
out
again
the
sun
had
set
and
darkness
was
gathering
over
the
plain
lightened
a
little
by
the
stars
that
made
stunted
ghosts
out
of
the
cactus
growths
no
cattle
no
plowed
fields
muttered
conan
how
do
these
people
live
perhaps
the
cattle
are
in
pens
for
the
night
suggested
valeria
and
the
fields
and
are
on
the
other
side
of
the
city
maybe
he
grunted
i
did
see
any
from
the
crag
though
the
moon
came
up
behind
the
city
etching
walls
and
towers
blackly
in
the
yellow
glow
valeria
shivered
black
against
the
moon
the
strange
city
had
a
somber
sinister
look
perhaps
something
of
the
same
feeling
occurred
to
conan
for
he
stopped
glanced
about
him
and
grunted
we
stop
here
no
use
coming
to
their
gates
in
the
night
they
probably
would
let
us
in
besides
we
need
rest
and
we
do
know
how
they
receive
us
a
few
hours
sleep
will
put
us
in
better
shape
to
fight
or
run
he
led
the
way
to
a
bed
of
cactus
which
grew
in
a
circle
a
phenomenon
common
to
the
southern
desert
with
his
sword
he
chopped
an
opening
and
motioned
valeria
to
enter
we
be
safe
from
snakes
here
anyhow
she
glanced
fearfully
back
toward
the
black
line
that
indicated
the
forest
some
six
miles
away
suppose
a
dragon
comes
out
of
the
woods
we
keep
watch
he
answered
though
he
made
no
suggestion
as
to
what
they
would
do
in
such
an
event
he
was
staring
at
the
city
a
few
miles
away
not
a
light
shone
from
spire
or
tower
a
great
black
mass
of
mystery
it
reared
cryptically
against
the
moonlit
sky
lie
down
and
sleep
i
keep
the
first
watch
she
hesitated
glancing
at
him
uncertainly
but
he
sat
down
in
the
opening
facing
toward
the
plain
his
sword
across
his
knees
his
back
to
her
without
further
comment
she
lay
down
on
the
sand
inside
the
spiky
circle
wake
me
when
the
moon
is
at
its
zenith
she
directed
he
did
not
reply
nor
look
toward
her
her
last
impression
as
she
sank
into
slumber
was
of
his
muscular
figure
immobile
as
a
statue
hewn
out
of
bronze
outlined
against
the
stars
by
the
blaze
of
the
valeria
awoke
with
a
start
to
the
realization
that
a
gray
dawn
was
stealing
over
the
plain
she
sat
up
rubbing
her
eyes
conan
squatted
beside
the
cactus
cutting
off
the
thick
pears
and
dexterously
twitching
out
the
spikes
you
did
awake
me
she
accused
you
let
me
sleep
all
night
you
were
tired
he
answered
your
posterior
must
have
been
sore
too
after
that
long
ride
you
pirates
are
used
to
horseback
what
about
yourself
she
retorted
i
was
a
before
i
was
a
pirate
he
answered
they
live
in
the
saddle
i
snatch
naps
like
a
panther
watching
beside
the
trail
for
a
deer
to
come
by
my
ears
keep
watch
while
my
eyes
sleep
and
indeed
the
giant
barbarian
seemed
as
much
refreshed
as
if
he
had
slept
the
whole
night
on
a
golden
bed
having
removed
the
thorns
and
peeled
off
the
tough
skin
he
handed
the
girl
a
thick
juicy
cactus
leaf
skin
your
teeth
in
that
pear
it
food
and
drink
to
a
desert
man
i
was
a
chief
of
the
zuagirs
once
desert
men
who
live
by
plundering
the
caravans
is
there
anything
you
have
been
inquired
the
girl
half
in
derision
and
half
in
fascination
i
never
been
king
of
an
hyborian
kingdom
he
grinned
taking
an
enormous
mouthful
of
cactus
but
i
dreamed
of
being
even
that
i
may
be
too
some
day
why
should
i
she
shook
her
head
in
wonder
at
his
calm
audacity
and
fell
to
devouring
her
pear
she
found
it
not
unpleasing
to
the
palate
and
full
of
cool
and
juice
finishing
his
meal
conan
wiped
his
hands
in
the
sand
rose
ran
his
fingers
through
his
thick
black
mane
hitched
at
his
and
said
well
let
go
if
the
people
in
that
city
are
going
to
cut
our
throats
they
may
as
well
do
it
now
before
the
heat
of
the
day
begins
his
grim
humor
was
unconscious
but
valeria
reflected
that
it
might
be
prophetic
she
too
hitched
her
as
she
rose
her
terrors
of
the
night
were
past
the
roaring
dragons
of
the
distant
forest
were
like
a
dim
dream
there
was
a
swagger
in
her
stride
as
she
moved
off
beside
the
cimmerian
whatever
perils
lay
ahead
of
them
their
foes
would
be
men
and
valeria
of
the
red
brotherhood
had
never
seen
the
face
of
the
man
she
feared
conan
glanced
down
at
her
as
she
strode
along
beside
him
with
her
swinging
stride
that
matched
his
own
you
walk
more
like
a
hillman
than
a
sailor
he
said
you
must
be
an
aquilonian
the
suns
of
darfar
never
burnt
your
white
skin
brown
many
a
princess
would
envy
you
i
am
from
aquilonia
she
replied
his
compliments
no
longer
irritated
her
his
evident
admiration
pleased
her
for
another
man
to
have
kept
her
watch
while
she
slept
would
have
angered
her
she
had
always
fiercely
resented
any
man
attempting
to
shield
or
protect
her
because
of
her
sex
but
she
found
a
secret
pleasure
in
the
fact
that
this
man
had
done
so
and
he
had
not
taken
advantage
of
her
fright
and
the
weakness
resulting
from
it
after
all
she
reflected
her
companion
was
no
common
man
the
sun
rose
behind
the
city
turning
the
towers
to
a
sinister
crimson
black
last
night
against
the
moon
grunted
conan
his
eyes
clouding
with
the
abysmal
superstition
of
the
barbarian
as
a
threat
of
blood
against
the
sun
this
dawn
i
do
not
like
this
city
but
they
went
on
and
as
they
went
conan
pointed
out
the
fact
that
no
road
ran
to
the
city
from
the
north
no
cattle
have
trampled
the
plain
on
this
side
of
the
city
said
he
no
plowshare
has
touched
the
earth
for
years
maybe
centuries
but
look
once
this
plain
was
cultivated
valeria
saw
the
ancient
irrigation
ditches
he
indicated
half
filled
in
places
and
overgrown
with
cactus
she
frowned
with
perplexity
as
her
eyes
swept
over
the
plain
that
stretched
on
all
sides
of
the
city
to
the
forest
edge
which
marched
in
a
vast
dim
ring
vision
did
not
extend
beyond
that
ring
she
looked
uneasily
at
the
city
no
helmets
or
gleamed
on
battlements
no
trumpets
sounded
no
challenge
rang
from
the
towers
a
silence
as
absolute
as
that
of
the
forest
brooded
over
the
walls
and
minarets
the
sun
was
high
above
the
eastern
horizon
when
they
stood
before
the
great
gate
in
the
northern
wall
in
the
shadow
of
the
lofty
rampart
rust
flecked
the
iron
bracings
of
the
mighty
bronze
portal
spiderwebs
glistened
thickly
on
hinge
and
sill
and
bolted
panel
it
has
been
opened
for
years
exclaimed
valeria
a
dead
city
grunted
conan
that
why
the
ditches
were
broken
and
the
plain
untouched
but
who
built
it
who
dwelt
here
where
did
they
go
why
did
they
abandon
it
who
can
say
maybe
an
exiled
clan
of
stygians
built
it
maybe
not
it
does
look
like
stygian
architecture
maybe
the
people
were
wiped
out
by
enemies
or
a
plague
exterminated
them
in
that
case
their
treasures
may
still
be
gathering
dust
and
cobwebs
in
there
suggested
valeria
the
acquisitive
instincts
of
her
profession
waking
in
her
prodded
too
by
feminine
curiosity
can
we
open
the
gate
let
go
in
and
explore
a
bit
conan
eyed
the
heavy
portal
dubiously
but
placed
his
massive
shoulder
against
it
and
thrust
with
all
the
power
of
his
muscular
calves
and
thighs
with
a
rasping
screech
of
rusty
hinges
the
gate
moved
ponderously
inward
and
conan
straightened
and
drew
his
sword
valeria
stared
over
his
shoulder
and
made
a
sound
indicative
of
surprise
they
were
not
looking
into
an
open
street
or
court
as
one
would
have
expected
the
opened
gate
or
door
gave
directly
into
a
long
broad
hall
which
ran
away
and
away
until
its
vista
grew
indistinct
in
the
distance
it
was
of
heroic
proportions
and
the
floor
of
a
curious
red
stone
cut
in
square
tiles
that
seemed
to
smolder
as
if
with
the
reflection
of
flames
the
walls
were
of
a
shiny
green
material
jade
or
i
a
shemite
swore
conan
not
in
such
quantity
protested
valeria
i
looted
enough
from
the
khitan
caravans
to
know
what
i
talking
about
he
asserted
that
jade
the
vaulted
ceiling
was
of
lapis
lazuli
adorned
with
clusters
of
great
green
stones
that
gleamed
with
a
poisonous
radiance
green
growled
conan
that
what
the
people
of
punt
call
them
they
supposed
to
be
the
petrified
eyes
of
those
prehistoric
snakes
the
ancients
called
golden
serpents
they
glow
like
a
cat
eyes
in
the
dark
at
night
this
hall
would
be
lighted
by
them
but
it
would
be
a
hellishly
weird
illumination
let
look
around
we
might
find
a
cache
of
jewels
shut
the
door
advised
valeria
i
hate
to
have
to
outrun
a
dragon
down
this
hall
conan
grinned
and
replied
i
do
believe
the
dragons
ever
leave
the
forest
but
he
complied
and
pointed
out
the
broken
bolt
on
the
inner
side
i
thought
i
heard
something
snap
when
i
shoved
against
it
that
freshly
broken
rust
has
eaten
nearly
through
it
if
the
people
ran
away
why
should
it
have
been
bolted
on
the
inside
they
undoubtedly
left
by
another
door
suggested
valeria
she
wondered
how
many
centuries
had
passed
since
the
light
of
outer
day
had
filtered
into
that
great
hall
through
the
open
door
sunlight
was
finding
its
way
somehow
into
the
hall
and
they
quickly
saw
the
source
high
up
in
the
vaulted
ceiling
skylights
were
set
in
openings
translucent
sheets
of
some
crystalline
substance
in
the
splotches
of
shadow
between
them
the
green
jewels
winked
like
the
eyes
of
angry
cats
beneath
their
feet
the
dully
lurid
floor
smoldered
with
changing
hues
and
colors
of
flame
it
was
like
treading
the
floors
of
hell
with
evil
stars
blinking
overhead
three
balustraded
galleries
ran
along
on
each
side
of
the
hall
one
above
the
other
a
house
grunted
conan
and
this
hall
extends
to
the
roof
it
long
as
a
street
i
seem
to
see
a
door
at
the
other
end
valeria
shrugged
her
white
shoulders
your
eyes
are
better
than
mine
then
though
i
accounted
among
the
they
turned
into
an
open
door
at
random
and
traversed
a
series
of
empty
chambers
floored
like
the
hall
and
with
walls
of
the
same
green
jade
or
of
marble
or
ivory
or
chalcedony
adorned
with
friezes
of
bronze
gold
or
silver
in
the
ceilings
the
green
were
set
and
their
light
was
as
ghostly
and
illusive
as
conan
had
predicted
under
the
glow
the
intruders
moved
like
specters
some
of
the
chambers
lacked
this
illumination
and
their
doorways
showed
black
as
the
mouth
of
the
pit
these
conan
and
valeria
avoided
keeping
always
to
the
lighted
chambers
cobwebs
hung
in
the
corners
but
there
was
no
perceptible
accumulation
of
dust
on
the
floor
or
on
the
tables
and
seats
of
marble
jade
or
carnelian
which
occupied
the
chambers
here
and
there
were
rugs
of
that
silk
known
as
khitan
which
is
practically
indestructible
nowhere
did
they
find
any
windows
or
doors
opening
into
streets
or
courts
each
door
merely
opened
into
another
chamber
or
hall
why
do
we
come
to
a
street
grumbled
valeria
this
place
or
whatever
we
in
must
be
as
big
as
the
king
of
turan
seraglio
they
must
not
have
perished
of
plague
said
conan
meditating
upon
the
mystery
of
the
empty
city
otherwise
we
find
skeletons
maybe
it
became
haunted
and
everybody
got
up
and
left
maybe
maybe
hell
broke
in
valeria
rudely
we
never
know
look
at
these
friezes
they
portray
men
what
race
do
they
belong
to
conan
scanned
them
and
shook
his
head
i
never
saw
people
exactly
like
them
but
there
the
smack
of
the
east
about
them
vendhya
maybe
or
kosala
were
you
a
king
in
kosala
she
asked
masking
her
keen
curiosity
with
derision
no
but
i
was
a
of
the
afghulis
who
live
in
the
himelian
mountains
above
the
borders
of
vendhya
these
people
favor
the
kosalans
but
why
should
kosalans
be
building
a
city
this
far
to
west
the
figures
portrayed
were
those
of
slender
men
and
women
with
finely
chiseled
exotic
features
they
wore
filmy
robes
and
many
delicate
jeweled
ornaments
and
were
depicted
mostly
in
attitudes
of
feasting
dancing
or
easterners
all
right
grunted
conan
but
from
where
i
do
know
they
must
have
lived
a
disgustingly
peaceful
life
though
or
have
scenes
of
wars
and
fights
let
go
up
that
stair
it
was
an
ivory
spiral
that
wound
up
from
the
chamber
in
which
they
were
standing
they
mounted
three
flights
and
came
into
a
broad
chamber
on
the
fourth
floor
which
seemed
to
be
the
highest
tier
in
the
building
skylights
in
the
ceiling
illuminated
the
room
in
which
light
the
winked
pallidly
glancing
through
the
doors
they
saw
except
on
one
side
a
series
of
similarly
lighted
chambers
this
other
door
opened
upon
a
balustraded
gallery
that
overhung
a
hall
much
smaller
than
the
one
they
had
recently
explored
on
the
lower
floor
hell
valeria
sat
down
disgustedly
on
a
jade
bench
the
people
who
deserted
this
city
must
have
taken
all
their
treasures
with
them
tired
of
wandering
through
these
bare
rooms
at
random
all
these
upper
chambers
seem
to
be
lighted
said
conan
i
wish
we
could
find
a
window
that
overlooked
the
city
let
have
a
look
through
that
door
over
there
you
have
a
look
advised
valeria
i
going
to
sit
here
and
rest
my
feet
conan
disappeared
through
the
door
opposite
that
one
opening
upon
the
gallery
and
valeria
leaned
back
with
her
hands
clasped
behind
her
head
and
thrust
her
booted
legs
out
in
front
of
her
these
silent
rooms
and
halls
with
their
gleaming
green
clusters
of
ornaments
and
burning
crimson
floors
were
beginning
to
depress
her
she
wished
they
could
find
their
way
out
of
the
maze
into
which
they
had
wandered
and
emerge
into
a
street
she
wondered
idly
what
furtive
dark
feet
had
glided
over
those
flaming
floors
in
past
centuries
how
many
deeds
of
cruelty
and
mystery
those
winking
had
blazed
down
upon
it
was
a
faint
noise
that
brought
her
out
of
her
reflections
she
was
on
her
feet
with
her
sword
in
her
hand
before
she
realized
what
had
disturbed
her
conan
had
not
returned
and
she
knew
it
was
not
he
that
she
had
heard
the
sound
had
come
from
somewhere
beyond
the
door
that
opened
on
to
the
gallery
soundlessly
in
her
soft
leather
boots
she
glided
through
it
crept
across
the
balcony
and
peered
down
between
the
heavy
balustrades
man
was
stealing
along
the
the
sight
of
a
human
being
in
this
supposedly
deserted
city
was
a
startling
shock
crouching
down
behind
the
stone
balusters
with
every
nerve
tingling
valeria
glared
down
at
the
stealthy
figure
the
man
in
no
way
resembled
the
figures
depicted
on
the
friezes
he
was
slightly
above
middle
height
very
dark
though
not
negroid
he
was
naked
but
for
a
scanty
silk
clout
that
only
partly
covered
his
muscular
hips
and
a
leather
girdle
a
hand
breadth
broad
about
his
lean
waist
his
long
black
hair
hung
in
lank
strands
about
his
shoulders
giving
him
a
wild
appearance
he
was
gaunt
but
knots
and
cords
of
muscles
stood
out
on
his
arms
and
legs
without
that
fleshy
padding
that
presents
a
pleasing
symmetry
of
contour
he
was
built
with
an
economy
that
was
almost
repellent
yet
it
was
not
so
much
his
physical
appearance
as
his
attitude
that
impressed
the
woman
who
watched
him
he
slunk
along
stooped
in
a
his
head
turning
from
side
to
side
he
grasped
a
blade
in
his
right
hand
and
she
saw
it
shake
with
the
intensity
of
the
emotion
that
gripped
him
he
was
afraid
trembling
in
the
grip
of
some
dire
terror
when
he
turned
his
head
she
caught
the
blaze
of
wild
eyes
among
the
lank
strands
of
black
hair
he
did
not
see
her
on
tiptoe
he
glided
across
the
hall
and
vanished
through
an
open
door
a
moment
later
she
heard
a
choking
cry
and
then
silence
fell
again
consumed
with
curiosity
valeria
glided
along
the
gallery
until
she
came
to
a
door
above
the
one
through
which
the
man
had
passed
it
opened
into
another
smaller
gallery
that
encircled
a
large
chamber
this
chamber
was
on
the
third
floor
and
its
ceiling
was
not
so
high
as
that
of
the
hall
it
was
lighted
only
by
the
and
their
weird
green
glow
left
the
spaces
under
the
balcony
in
shadows
valeria
eyes
widened
the
man
she
had
seen
was
still
in
the
chamber
he
lay
face
down
on
a
dark
crimson
carpet
in
the
middle
of
the
room
his
body
was
limp
his
arms
spread
wide
his
curved
sword
lay
near
him
she
wondered
why
he
should
lie
there
so
motionless
then
her
eyes
narrowed
as
she
stared
down
at
the
rug
on
which
he
lay
beneath
and
about
him
the
fabric
showed
a
slightly
different
color
a
deeper
brighter
crimson
shivering
slightly
she
crouched
down
closer
behind
the
balustrade
intently
scanning
the
shadows
under
the
overhanging
gallery
they
gave
up
no
secret
suddenly
another
figure
entered
the
grim
drama
he
was
a
man
similar
to
the
first
and
he
came
in
by
a
door
opposite
that
which
gave
upon
the
hall
his
eyes
glared
at
the
sight
of
the
man
on
the
floor
and
he
spoke
something
in
a
staccato
voice
that
sounded
like
chicmec
the
other
did
not
move
the
man
stepped
quickly
across
the
floor
bent
gripped
the
fallen
shoulder
and
turned
him
over
a
choking
cry
escaped
him
as
the
head
fell
back
limply
disclosing
a
throat
that
had
been
severed
from
ear
to
ear
the
man
let
the
corpse
fall
back
upon
the
carpet
and
sprang
to
his
feet
shaking
like
a
leaf
his
face
was
an
ashy
mask
of
fear
but
with
one
knee
flexed
for
flight
he
froze
suddenly
became
as
immobile
as
an
image
staring
across
the
chamber
with
dilated
eyes
in
the
shadows
beneath
the
balcony
a
ghostly
light
began
to
glow
and
grow
a
light
that
was
not
part
of
the
gleam
valeria
felt
her
hair
stir
as
she
watched
it
for
dimly
visible
in
the
throbbing
radiance
there
floated
a
human
skull
and
it
was
from
this
skull
human
yet
appallingly
misshapen
that
the
spectral
light
seemed
to
emanate
it
hung
there
like
a
disembodied
head
conjured
out
of
night
and
the
shadows
growing
more
and
more
distinct
human
and
yet
not
human
as
she
knew
humanity
the
man
stood
motionless
an
embodiment
of
paralyzed
horror
staring
fixedly
at
the
apparition
the
thing
moved
out
from
the
wall
and
a
grotesque
shadow
moved
with
it
slowly
the
shadow
became
visible
as
a
figure
whose
naked
torso
and
limbs
shone
whitely
with
the
hue
of
bleached
bones
the
bare
skull
on
its
shoulders
grinned
eyelessly
in
the
midst
of
its
unholy
nimbus
and
the
man
confronting
it
seemed
unable
to
take
his
eyes
from
it
he
stood
still
his
sword
dangling
from
nerveless
fingers
on
his
face
the
expression
of
a
man
bound
by
the
spells
of
a
mesmerist
valeria
realized
that
it
was
not
fear
alone
that
paralyzed
him
some
hellish
quality
of
that
throbbing
glow
had
robbed
him
of
his
power
to
think
and
act
she
herself
safely
above
the
scene
felt
the
subtle
impact
of
a
nameless
emanation
that
was
a
threat
to
sanity
the
horror
swept
toward
its
victim
and
he
moved
at
last
but
only
to
drop
his
sword
and
sink
to
his
knees
covering
his
eyes
with
his
hands
dumbly
he
awaited
the
stroke
of
the
blade
that
now
gleamed
in
the
apparition
hand
as
it
reared
above
him
like
death
triumphant
over
mankind
valeria
acted
according
to
the
first
impulse
of
her
wayward
nature
with
one
tigerish
movement
she
was
over
the
balustrade
and
dropping
to
the
floor
behind
the
awful
shape
it
wheeled
at
the
thud
of
her
soft
boots
on
the
floor
but
even
as
it
turned
her
keen
blade
lashed
down
and
a
fierce
exultation
swept
her
as
she
felt
the
edge
cleave
solid
flesh
and
mortal
bone
the
apparition
cried
out
gurglingly
and
went
down
severed
through
shoulder
and
spine
and
as
it
fell
the
burning
skull
rolled
clear
revealing
a
lank
mop
of
black
hair
and
a
dark
face
twisted
in
the
convulsions
of
death
beneath
the
horrific
masquerade
there
was
a
human
being
a
man
similar
to
the
one
kneeling
supinely
on
the
floor
the
latter
looked
up
at
the
sound
of
the
blow
and
the
cry
and
now
he
glared
in
amazement
at
the
woman
who
stood
over
the
corpse
with
a
dripping
sword
in
her
hand
he
staggered
up
yammering
as
if
the
sight
had
almost
unseated
his
reason
she
was
amazed
to
realize
that
she
understood
him
he
was
gibbering
in
the
stygian
tongue
though
in
a
dialect
unfamiliar
to
her
who
are
you
whence
come
you
what
do
you
in
xuchotl
then
rushing
on
without
waiting
for
her
to
reply
but
you
are
a
friend
goddess
or
devil
it
makes
no
difference
you
have
slain
the
burning
skull
it
was
but
a
man
beneath
it
after
all
we
deemed
it
a
demon
conjured
up
out
of
the
catacombs
he
stopped
short
in
his
ravings
and
stiffened
straining
his
ears
with
painful
intensity
the
girl
heard
nothing
we
must
hasten
he
whispered
are
west
of
the
great
hall
they
may
be
all
around
us
here
they
may
be
creeping
upon
us
even
now
he
seized
her
wrist
in
a
convulsive
grasp
she
found
hard
to
break
whom
do
you
mean
by
she
demanded
he
stared
at
her
uncomprehendingly
for
an
instant
as
if
he
found
her
ignorance
hard
to
understand
they
he
stammered
vaguely
why
why
the
people
of
xotalanc
the
clan
of
the
man
you
slew
they
who
dwell
by
the
eastern
gate
you
mean
to
say
this
city
is
inhabited
she
exclaimed
aye
aye
he
was
writhing
in
the
impatience
of
apprehension
come
away
come
quick
we
must
return
to
tecuhltli
where
is
that
she
demanded
the
quarter
by
the
western
gate
he
had
her
wrist
again
and
was
pulling
her
toward
the
door
through
which
he
had
first
come
great
beads
of
perspiration
dripped
from
his
dark
forehead
and
his
eyes
blazed
with
terror
wait
a
minute
she
growled
flinging
off
his
hand
keep
your
hands
off
me
or
i
split
your
skull
what
all
this
about
who
are
you
where
would
you
take
me
he
took
a
firm
grip
on
himself
casting
glances
to
all
sides
and
began
speaking
so
fast
his
words
tripped
over
each
other
my
name
is
techotl
i
am
of
tecuhltli
i
and
this
man
who
lies
with
his
throat
cut
came
into
the
halls
of
science
to
try
and
ambush
some
of
the
xotalancas
but
we
became
separated
and
i
returned
here
to
find
him
with
his
gullet
slit
the
burning
skull
did
it
i
know
just
as
he
would
have
slain
me
had
you
not
killed
him
but
perhaps
he
was
not
alone
others
may
be
stealing
from
xotalanc
the
gods
themselves
blench
at
the
fate
of
those
they
take
alive
at
the
thought
he
shook
as
with
an
ague
and
his
dark
skin
grew
ashy
valeria
frowned
puzzledly
at
him
she
sensed
intelligence
behind
this
rigmarole
but
it
was
meaningless
to
her
she
turned
toward
the
skull
which
still
glowed
and
pulsed
on
the
floor
and
was
reaching
a
booted
toe
tentatively
toward
it
when
the
man
who
called
himself
techotl
sprang
forward
with
a
cry
do
not
touch
it
do
not
even
look
at
it
madness
and
death
lurk
in
it
the
wizards
of
xotalanc
understand
its
secret
they
found
it
in
the
catacombs
where
lie
the
bones
of
terrible
kings
who
ruled
in
xuchotl
in
the
black
centuries
of
the
past
to
gaze
upon
it
freezes
the
blood
and
withers
the
brain
of
a
man
who
understands
not
its
mystery
to
touch
it
causes
madness
and
destruction
she
scowled
at
him
uncertainly
he
was
not
a
reassuring
figure
with
his
lean
frame
and
snaky
locks
in
his
eyes
behind
the
glow
of
terror
lurked
a
weird
light
she
had
never
seen
in
the
eyes
of
a
man
wholly
sane
yet
he
seemed
sincere
in
his
protestations
come
he
begged
reaching
for
her
hand
and
then
recoiling
as
he
remembered
her
warning
you
are
a
stranger
how
you
came
here
i
do
not
know
but
if
you
were
a
goddess
or
a
demon
come
to
aid
tecuhltli
you
would
know
all
the
things
you
have
asked
me
you
must
be
from
beyond
the
great
forest
whence
our
ancestors
came
but
you
are
our
friend
or
you
would
not
have
slain
my
enemy
come
quickly
before
the
xotalancas
find
us
and
slay
us
from
his
repellent
impassioned
face
she
glanced
to
the
sinister
skull
smoldering
and
glowing
on
the
floor
near
the
dead
man
it
was
like
a
skull
seen
in
a
dream
undeniably
human
yet
with
disturbing
distortions
and
malformations
of
contour
and
outline
in
life
the
wearer
of
that
skull
must
have
presented
an
alien
and
monstrous
aspect
life
it
seemed
to
possess
some
sort
of
life
of
its
own
its
jaws
yawned
at
her
and
snapped
together
its
radiance
grew
brighter
more
vivid
yet
the
impression
of
nightmare
grew
too
it
was
a
dream
all
life
was
a
dream
it
was
techotl
urgent
voice
which
snapped
valeria
back
from
the
dim
gulfs
whither
she
was
drifting
do
not
look
at
the
skull
do
not
look
at
the
skull
it
was
a
far
cry
from
across
unreckoned
voids
valeria
shook
herself
like
a
lion
shaking
his
mane
her
vision
cleared
techotl
was
chattering
in
life
it
housed
the
awful
brain
of
a
king
of
magicians
it
holds
still
the
life
and
fire
of
magic
drawn
from
outer
spaces
with
a
curse
valeria
leaped
lithe
as
a
panther
and
the
skull
crashed
to
flaming
bits
under
her
swinging
sword
somewhere
in
the
room
or
in
the
void
or
in
the
dim
reaches
of
her
consciousness
an
inhuman
voice
cried
out
in
pain
and
rage
techotl
hand
was
plucking
at
her
arm
and
he
was
gibbering
you
have
broken
it
you
have
destroyed
it
not
all
the
black
arts
of
xotalanc
can
rebuild
it
come
away
come
away
quickly
now
but
i
ca
go
she
protested
i
have
a
friend
somewhere
near
by
the
flare
of
his
eyes
cut
her
short
as
he
stared
past
her
with
an
expression
grown
ghastly
she
wheeled
just
as
four
men
rushed
through
as
many
doors
converging
on
the
pair
in
the
center
of
the
chamber
they
were
like
the
others
she
had
seen
the
same
knotted
muscles
bulging
on
otherwise
gaunt
limbs
the
same
lank
hair
the
same
mad
glare
in
their
wide
eyes
they
were
armed
and
clad
like
techotl
but
on
the
breast
of
each
was
painted
a
white
skull
there
were
no
challenges
or
like
tigers
the
men
of
xotalanc
sprang
at
the
throats
of
their
enemies
techotl
met
them
with
the
fury
of
desperation
ducked
the
swipe
of
a
blade
and
grappled
with
the
wielder
and
bore
him
to
the
floor
where
they
rolled
and
wrestled
in
murderous
silence
the
other
three
swarmed
on
valeria
their
weird
eyes
red
as
the
eyes
of
mad
dogs
illustration
you
can
never
reach
the
coast
there
is
no
escape
from
xuchotl
she
killed
the
first
who
came
within
reach
before
he
could
strike
a
blow
her
long
straight
blade
splitting
his
skull
even
as
his
own
sword
lifted
for
a
stroke
she
a
thrust
even
as
she
parried
a
slash
her
eyes
danced
and
her
lips
smiled
without
mercy
again
she
was
valeria
of
the
red
brotherhood
and
the
hum
of
her
steel
was
like
a
bridal
song
in
her
ears
her
sword
darted
past
a
blade
that
sought
to
parry
and
sheathed
six
inches
of
its
point
in
a
midriff
the
man
gasped
agonizedly
and
went
to
his
knees
but
his
tall
mate
lunged
in
in
ferocious
silence
raining
blow
on
blow
so
furiously
that
valeria
had
no
opportunity
to
counter
she
stepped
back
coolly
parrying
the
strokes
and
watching
for
her
chance
to
thrust
home
he
could
not
long
keep
up
that
flailing
whirlwind
his
arm
would
tire
his
wind
would
fail
he
would
weaken
falter
and
then
her
blade
would
slide
smoothly
into
his
heart
a
sidelong
glance
showed
her
techotl
kneeling
on
the
breast
of
his
antagonist
and
striving
to
break
the
other
hold
on
his
wrist
and
to
drive
home
a
dagger
sweat
beaded
the
forehead
of
the
man
facing
her
and
his
eyes
were
like
burning
coals
smite
as
he
would
he
could
not
break
past
nor
beat
down
her
guard
his
breath
came
in
gusty
gulps
his
blows
began
to
fall
erratically
she
stepped
back
to
draw
him
out
and
felt
her
thighs
locked
in
an
iron
grip
she
had
forgotten
the
wounded
man
on
the
floor
crouching
on
his
knees
he
held
her
with
both
arms
locked
about
her
legs
and
his
mate
croaked
in
triumph
and
began
working
his
way
around
to
come
at
her
from
the
left
side
valeria
wrenched
and
tore
savagely
but
in
vain
she
could
free
herself
of
this
clinging
menace
with
a
downward
flick
of
her
sword
but
in
that
instant
the
curved
blade
of
the
tall
warrior
would
crash
through
her
skull
the
wounded
man
began
to
worry
at
her
bare
thigh
with
his
teeth
like
a
wild
beast
she
reached
down
with
her
left
hand
and
gripped
his
long
hair
forcing
his
head
back
so
that
his
white
teeth
and
rolling
eyes
gleamed
up
at
her
the
tall
xotalanc
cried
out
fiercely
and
leaped
in
smiting
with
all
the
fury
of
his
arm
awkwardly
she
parried
the
stroke
and
it
beat
the
flat
of
her
blade
down
on
her
head
so
that
she
saw
sparks
flash
before
her
eyes
and
staggered
up
went
the
sword
again
with
a
low
cry
of
triumph
and
then
a
giant
form
loomed
behind
the
xotalanc
and
steel
flashed
like
a
jet
of
blue
lightning
the
cry
of
the
warrior
broke
short
and
he
went
down
like
an
ox
beneath
the
his
brains
gushing
from
his
skull
that
had
been
split
to
the
throat
conan
gasped
valeria
in
a
gust
of
passion
she
turned
on
the
xotalanc
whose
long
hair
she
still
gripped
in
her
left
hand
dog
of
hell
her
blade
swished
as
it
cut
the
air
in
an
upswinging
arc
with
a
blur
in
the
middle
and
the
headless
body
slumped
down
spurting
blood
she
hurled
the
severed
head
across
the
room
what
the
devil
going
on
here
conan
bestrode
the
corpse
of
the
man
he
had
killed
broadsword
in
hand
glaring
about
him
in
amazement
techotl
was
rising
from
the
twitching
figure
of
the
last
xotalanc
shaking
red
drops
from
his
dagger
he
was
bleeding
from
the
stab
deep
in
the
thigh
he
stared
at
conan
with
dilated
eyes
what
is
all
this
conan
demanded
again
not
yet
recovered
from
the
stunning
surprise
of
finding
valeria
engaged
in
a
savage
battle
with
these
fantastic
figures
in
a
city
he
had
thought
empty
and
uninhabited
returning
from
an
aimless
exploration
of
the
upper
chambers
to
find
valeria
missing
from
the
room
where
he
had
left
her
he
had
followed
the
sounds
of
strife
that
burst
on
his
dumbfounded
ears
five
dead
dogs
exclaimed
techotl
his
flaming
eyes
reflecting
a
ghastly
exultation
five
slain
five
crimson
nails
for
the
black
pillar
the
gods
of
blood
be
thanked
he
lifted
quivering
hands
on
high
and
then
with
the
face
of
a
fiend
he
spat
on
the
corpses
and
stamped
on
their
faces
dancing
in
his
ghoulish
glee
his
recent
allies
eyed
him
in
amazement
and
conan
asked
in
the
aquilonian
tongue
who
is
this
madman
valeria
shrugged
her
shoulders
he
says
his
name
techotl
from
his
babblings
i
gather
that
his
people
live
at
one
end
of
this
crazy
city
and
these
others
at
the
other
end
maybe
we
better
go
with
him
he
seems
friendly
and
it
easy
to
see
that
the
other
clan
is
techotl
had
ceased
his
dancing
and
was
listening
again
his
head
tilted
sidewise
triumph
struggling
with
fear
in
his
repellent
countenance
come
away
now
he
whispered
we
have
done
enough
five
dead
dogs
my
people
will
welcome
you
they
will
honor
you
but
come
it
is
far
to
tecuhltli
at
any
moment
the
xotalancas
may
come
on
us
in
numbers
too
great
even
for
your
swords
lead
the
way
grunted
conan
techotl
instantly
mounted
a
stair
leading
up
to
the
gallery
beckoning
them
to
follow
him
which
they
did
moving
rapidly
to
keep
on
his
heels
having
reached
the
gallery
he
plunged
into
a
door
that
opened
toward
the
west
and
hurried
through
chamber
after
chamber
each
lighted
by
skylights
or
green
what
sort
of
a
place
can
this
be
muttered
valeria
under
her
breath
crom
knows
answered
conan
i
seen
kind
before
though
they
live
on
the
shores
of
lake
zuad
near
the
border
of
kush
they
a
sort
of
mongrel
stygians
mixed
with
another
race
that
wandered
into
stygia
from
the
east
some
centuries
ago
and
were
absorbed
by
them
called
tlazitlans
i
willing
to
bet
it
was
they
who
built
this
city
though
techotl
fear
did
not
seem
to
diminish
as
they
drew
away
from
the
chamber
where
the
dead
men
lay
he
kept
twisting
his
head
on
his
shoulder
to
listen
for
sounds
of
pursuit
and
stared
with
burning
intensity
into
every
doorway
they
passed
valeria
shivered
in
spite
of
herself
she
feared
no
man
but
the
weird
floor
beneath
her
feet
the
uncanny
jewels
over
her
head
dividing
the
lurking
shadows
among
them
the
stealth
and
terror
of
their
guide
impressed
her
with
a
nameless
apprehension
a
sensation
of
lurking
inhuman
peril
they
may
be
between
us
and
tecuhltli
he
whispered
once
we
must
beware
lest
they
be
lying
in
wait
why
do
we
get
out
of
this
infernal
palace
and
take
to
the
streets
demanded
valeria
there
are
no
streets
in
xuchotl
he
answered
no
squares
nor
open
courts
the
whole
city
is
built
like
one
giant
palace
under
one
great
roof
the
nearest
approach
to
a
street
is
the
great
hall
which
traverses
the
city
from
the
north
gate
to
the
south
gate
the
only
doors
opening
into
the
outer
world
are
the
city
gates
through
which
no
living
man
has
passed
for
fifty
years
how
long
have
you
dwelt
here
asked
conan
i
was
born
in
the
castle
of
tecuhltli
years
ago
i
have
never
set
foot
outside
the
city
for
the
love
of
the
gods
let
us
go
silently
these
halls
may
be
full
of
lurking
devils
olmec
shall
tell
you
all
when
we
reach
tecuhltli
so
in
silence
they
glided
on
with
the
green
blinking
overhead
and
the
flaming
floors
smoldering
under
their
feet
and
it
seemed
to
valeria
as
if
they
fled
through
hell
guided
by
a
goblin
yet
it
was
conan
who
halted
them
as
they
were
crossing
an
unusually
wide
chamber
his
ears
were
keener
even
than
the
ears
of
techotl
whetted
though
these
were
by
a
lifetime
of
warfare
in
those
silent
corridors
you
think
some
of
your
enemies
may
be
ahead
of
us
lying
in
ambush
they
prowl
through
these
rooms
at
all
hours
answered
techotl
as
do
we
the
halls
and
chambers
between
tecuhltli
and
xotalanc
are
a
disputed
region
owned
by
no
man
we
call
it
the
halls
of
silence
why
do
you
ask
because
men
are
in
the
chambers
ahead
of
us
answered
conan
i
heard
steel
clink
against
stone
again
a
shaking
seized
techotl
and
he
clenched
his
teeth
to
keep
them
from
chattering
perhaps
they
are
your
friends
suggested
valeria
we
dare
not
chance
it
he
panted
and
moved
with
frenzied
activity
he
turned
aside
and
glided
through
a
doorway
on
the
left
which
led
into
a
chamber
from
which
an
ivory
staircase
wound
down
into
darkness
this
leads
to
an
unlighted
corridor
below
us
he
hissed
great
beads
of
perspiration
standing
out
on
his
brow
they
may
be
lurking
there
too
it
may
all
be
a
trick
to
draw
us
into
it
but
we
must
take
the
chance
that
they
have
laid
their
ambush
in
the
rooms
above
come
swiftly
now
softly
as
phantoms
they
descended
the
stair
and
came
to
the
mouth
of
a
corridor
black
as
night
they
crouched
there
for
a
moment
listening
and
then
melted
into
it
as
they
moved
along
valeria
flesh
crawled
between
her
shoulders
in
momentary
expectation
of
a
in
the
dark
but
for
conan
iron
fingers
gripping
her
arm
she
had
no
physical
cognizance
of
her
companions
neither
made
as
much
noise
as
a
cat
would
have
made
the
darkness
was
absolute
one
hand
outstretched
touched
a
wall
and
occasionally
she
felt
a
door
under
her
fingers
the
hallway
seemed
interminable
suddenly
they
were
galvanized
by
a
sound
behind
them
valeria
flesh
crawled
anew
for
she
recognized
it
as
the
soft
opening
of
a
door
men
had
come
into
the
corridor
behind
them
even
with
the
thought
she
stumbled
over
something
that
felt
like
a
human
skull
it
rolled
across
the
floor
with
an
appalling
clatter
run
yelped
techotl
a
note
of
hysteria
in
his
voice
and
was
away
down
the
corridor
like
a
flying
ghost
again
valeria
felt
conan
hand
bearing
her
up
and
sweeping
her
along
as
they
raced
after
their
guide
conan
could
see
in
the
dark
no
better
than
she
but
he
possessed
a
sort
of
instinct
that
made
his
course
unerring
without
his
support
and
guidance
she
would
have
fallen
or
stumbled
against
the
wall
down
the
corridor
they
sped
while
the
swift
patter
of
flying
feet
drew
closer
and
closer
and
then
suddenly
techotl
panted
here
is
the
stair
after
me
quick
oh
quick
his
hand
came
out
of
the
dark
and
caught
valeria
wrist
as
she
stumbled
blindly
on
the
steps
she
felt
herself
half
dragged
half
lifted
up
the
winding
stair
while
conan
released
her
and
turned
on
the
steps
his
ears
and
instincts
telling
him
their
foes
were
hard
at
their
backs
the
sounds
were
not
all
those
of
human
something
came
writhing
up
the
steps
something
that
slithered
and
rustled
and
brought
a
chill
in
the
air
with
it
conan
lashed
down
with
his
great
sword
and
felt
the
blade
shear
through
something
that
might
have
been
flesh
and
bone
and
cut
deep
into
the
stair
beneath
something
touched
his
foot
that
chilled
like
the
touch
of
frost
and
then
the
darkness
beneath
him
was
disturbed
by
a
frightful
thrashing
and
lashing
and
a
man
cried
out
in
agony
the
next
moment
conan
was
racing
up
the
winding
staircase
and
through
a
door
that
stood
open
at
the
head
valeria
and
techotl
were
already
through
and
techotl
slammed
the
door
and
shot
a
bolt
across
it
the
first
conan
had
seen
since
they
left
the
outer
gate
then
he
turned
and
ran
across
the
chamber
into
which
they
had
come
and
as
they
passed
through
the
farther
door
conan
glanced
back
and
saw
the
door
groaning
and
straining
under
heavy
pressure
violently
applied
from
the
other
side
though
techotl
did
not
abate
either
his
speed
or
his
caution
he
seemed
more
confident
now
he
had
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
come
into
familiar
territory
within
call
of
friends
but
conan
renewed
his
terror
by
asking
what
was
that
thing
that
i
fought
on
the
stair
the
men
of
xotalanc
answered
techotl
without
looking
back
i
told
you
the
halls
were
full
of
them
this
was
a
man
grunted
conan
it
was
something
that
crawled
and
it
was
as
cold
as
ice
to
the
touch
i
think
i
cut
it
asunder
it
fell
back
on
the
men
who
were
following
us
and
must
have
killed
one
of
them
in
its
death
throes
techotl
head
jerked
back
his
face
ashy
again
convulsively
he
quickened
his
pace
it
was
the
crawler
a
monster
have
brought
out
of
the
catacombs
to
aid
them
what
it
is
we
do
not
know
but
we
have
found
our
people
hideously
slain
by
it
in
set
name
hasten
if
they
put
it
on
our
trail
it
will
follow
us
to
the
very
doors
of
tecuhltli
i
doubt
it
grunted
conan
that
was
a
shrewd
cut
i
dealt
it
on
the
stair
hasten
hasten
groaned
techotl
they
ran
through
a
series
of
chambers
traversed
a
broad
hall
and
halted
before
a
giant
bronze
door
techotl
said
this
is
tecuhltli
the
people
of
the
techotl
smote
on
the
bronze
door
with
his
clenched
hand
and
then
turned
sidewise
so
that
he
could
watch
back
along
the
hall
men
have
been
smitten
down
before
this
door
when
they
thought
they
were
safe
he
said
why
do
they
open
the
door
asked
conan
they
are
looking
at
us
through
the
eye
answered
techotl
they
are
puzzled
at
the
sight
of
you
he
lifted
his
voice
and
called
open
the
door
xecelan
it
is
i
techotl
with
friends
from
the
great
world
beyond
the
forest
they
will
open
he
assured
his
allies
they
better
do
it
in
a
hurry
then
said
conan
grimly
i
hear
something
crawling
along
the
floor
beyond
the
hall
techotl
went
ashy
again
and
attacked
the
door
with
his
fists
screaming
open
you
fools
open
the
crawler
is
at
our
heels
even
as
he
beat
and
shouted
the
great
bronze
door
swung
noiselessly
back
revealing
a
heavy
chain
across
the
entrance
over
which
bristled
and
fierce
countenances
regarded
them
intently
for
an
instant
then
the
chain
was
dropped
and
techotl
grasped
the
arms
of
his
friends
in
a
nervous
frenzy
and
fairly
dragged
them
over
the
threshold
a
glance
over
his
shoulder
just
as
the
door
was
closing
showed
conan
the
long
dim
vista
of
the
hall
and
dimly
framed
at
the
other
end
an
ophidian
shape
that
writhed
slowly
and
painfully
into
view
flowing
in
a
length
from
a
chamber
door
its
hideous
head
wagging
drunkenly
then
the
closing
door
shut
off
the
view
inside
the
square
chamber
into
which
they
had
come
heavy
bolts
were
drawn
across
the
door
and
the
chain
locked
into
place
the
door
was
made
to
stand
the
battering
of
a
siege
four
men
stood
on
guard
of
the
same
breed
as
techotl
with
spears
in
their
hands
and
swords
at
their
hips
in
the
wall
near
the
door
there
was
a
complicated
contrivance
of
mirrors
which
conan
guessed
was
the
eye
techotl
had
mentioned
so
arranged
that
a
narrow
slot
in
the
wall
could
be
looked
through
from
within
without
being
discernible
from
without
the
four
guardsmen
stared
at
the
strangers
with
wonder
but
asked
no
question
nor
did
techotl
vouchsafe
any
information
he
moved
with
easy
confidence
now
as
if
he
had
shed
his
cloak
of
indecision
and
fear
the
instant
he
crossed
the
threshold
come
he
urged
his
friends
but
conan
glanced
toward
the
door
what
about
those
fellows
who
were
following
us
wo
they
try
to
storm
that
door
techotl
shook
his
head
they
know
they
can
not
break
down
the
door
of
the
eagle
they
will
flee
back
to
xotalanc
with
their
crawling
fiend
come
i
will
take
you
to
the
rulers
of
tecuhltli
one
of
the
four
guards
opened
the
door
opposite
the
one
by
which
they
had
entered
and
they
passed
through
into
a
hallway
which
like
most
of
the
rooms
on
that
level
was
lighted
by
both
the
skylights
and
the
clusters
of
winking
but
unlike
the
other
rooms
they
had
traversed
this
hall
showed
evidences
of
occupation
velvet
tapestries
adorned
the
glossy
jade
walls
rich
rugs
were
on
the
crimson
floors
and
the
ivory
seats
benches
and
divans
were
littered
with
satin
cushions
the
hall
ended
in
an
ornate
door
before
which
stood
no
guard
without
ceremony
techotl
thrust
the
door
open
and
ushered
his
friends
into
a
broad
chamber
where
some
thirty
men
and
women
lounging
on
couches
sprang
up
with
exclamations
of
amazement
the
men
all
except
one
were
of
the
same
type
as
techotl
and
the
women
were
equally
dark
and
though
not
unbeautiful
in
a
weird
dark
way
they
wore
sandals
golden
and
scanty
silk
skirts
supported
by
girdles
and
their
black
manes
cut
square
at
their
naked
shoulders
were
bound
with
silver
circlets
on
a
wide
ivory
seat
on
a
jade
dais
sat
a
man
and
a
woman
who
differed
subtly
from
the
others
he
was
a
giant
with
an
enormous
sweep
of
breast
and
the
shoulders
of
a
bull
unlike
the
others
he
was
bearded
with
a
thick
beard
which
fell
almost
to
his
broad
girdle
he
wore
a
robe
of
purple
silk
which
reflected
changing
sheens
of
color
with
his
every
movement
and
one
wide
sleeve
drawn
back
to
his
elbow
revealed
a
forearm
massive
with
corded
muscles
the
band
which
confined
his
locks
was
set
with
glittering
jewels
the
woman
beside
him
sprang
to
her
feet
with
a
startled
exclamation
as
the
strangers
entered
and
her
eyes
passing
over
conan
fixed
themselves
with
burning
intensity
on
valeria
she
was
tall
and
lithe
by
far
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
room
she
was
clad
more
scantily
even
than
the
others
for
instead
of
a
skirt
she
wore
merely
a
broad
strip
of
purple
cloth
fastened
to
the
middle
of
her
girdle
which
fell
below
her
knees
another
strip
at
the
back
of
her
girdle
completed
that
part
of
her
costume
which
she
wore
with
a
cynical
indifference
her
and
the
circlet
about
her
temples
were
adorned
with
gems
in
her
eyes
alone
of
all
the
people
there
lurked
no
brooding
gleam
of
madness
she
spoke
no
word
after
her
first
exclamation
she
stood
tensely
her
hands
clenched
staring
at
valeria
the
man
on
the
ivory
seat
had
not
risen
prince
olmec
spoke
techotl
bowing
low
with
arms
outspread
and
the
palms
of
his
hands
turned
upward
i
bring
allies
from
the
world
beyond
the
forest
in
the
chamber
of
tezcoti
the
burning
skull
slew
chicmec
my
companion
the
burning
skull
it
was
a
shuddering
whisper
of
fear
from
the
people
of
tecuhltli
aye
then
came
i
and
found
chicmec
lying
with
his
throat
cut
before
i
could
flee
the
burning
skull
came
upon
me
and
when
i
looked
upon
it
my
blood
became
as
ice
and
the
marrow
of
my
bones
melted
i
could
neither
fight
nor
run
i
could
only
await
the
stroke
then
came
this
woman
and
struck
him
down
with
her
sword
and
lo
it
was
only
a
dog
of
xotalanc
with
white
paint
upon
his
skin
and
the
living
skull
of
an
ancient
wizard
upon
his
head
now
that
skull
lies
in
many
pieces
and
the
dog
who
wore
it
is
a
dead
man
an
indescribably
fierce
exultation
edged
the
last
sentence
and
was
echoed
in
the
low
savage
exclamations
from
the
crowding
listeners
but
wait
exclaimed
techotl
there
is
more
while
i
talked
with
the
woman
four
xotalancas
came
upon
us
one
i
slew
there
is
the
stab
in
my
thigh
to
prove
how
desperate
was
the
fight
two
the
woman
killed
but
we
were
hard
pressed
when
this
man
came
into
the
fray
and
split
the
skull
of
the
fourth
aye
five
crimson
nails
there
are
to
be
driven
into
the
pillar
of
vengeance
he
pointed
at
a
black
column
of
ebony
which
stood
behind
the
dais
hundreds
of
red
dots
scarred
its
polished
surface
the
bright
scarlet
heads
of
heavy
copper
nails
driven
into
the
black
wood
five
red
nails
for
five
xotalanca
lives
exulted
techotl
and
the
horrible
exultation
in
the
faces
of
the
listeners
made
them
inhuman
who
are
these
people
asked
olmec
and
his
voice
was
like
the
low
deep
rumble
of
a
distant
bull
none
of
the
people
of
xuchotl
spoke
loudly
it
was
as
if
they
had
absorbed
into
their
souls
the
silence
of
the
empty
halls
and
deserted
chambers
i
am
conan
a
cimmerian
answered
the
barbarian
briefly
this
woman
is
valeria
of
the
red
brotherhood
an
aquilonian
pirate
we
are
deserters
from
an
army
on
the
darfar
border
far
to
the
north
and
are
trying
to
reach
the
coast
the
woman
on
the
dais
spoke
loudly
her
words
tripping
in
her
haste
you
can
never
reach
the
coast
there
is
no
escape
from
xuchotl
you
will
spend
the
rest
of
your
lives
in
this
city
what
do
you
mean
growled
conan
clapping
his
hand
to
his
hilt
and
stepping
about
so
as
to
face
both
the
dais
and
the
rest
of
the
room
are
you
telling
us
we
prisoners
she
did
not
mean
that
interposed
olmec
we
are
your
friends
we
would
not
restrain
you
against
your
will
but
i
fear
other
circumstances
will
make
it
impossible
for
you
to
leave
xuchotl
his
eyes
flickered
to
valeria
and
he
lowered
them
quickly
this
woman
is
tascela
he
said
she
is
a
princess
of
tecuhltli
but
let
food
and
drink
be
brought
our
guests
doubtless
they
are
hungry
and
weary
from
their
long
travels
he
indicated
an
ivory
table
and
after
an
exchange
of
glances
the
adventurers
seated
themselves
the
cimmerian
was
suspicious
his
fierce
blue
eyes
roved
about
the
chamber
and
he
kept
his
sword
close
to
his
hand
but
an
invitation
to
eat
and
drink
never
found
him
backward
his
eyes
kept
wandering
to
tascela
but
the
princess
had
eyes
only
for
his
companion
techotl
who
had
bound
a
strip
of
silk
about
his
wounded
thigh
placed
himself
at
the
table
to
attend
to
the
wants
of
his
friends
seeming
to
consider
it
a
privilege
and
honor
to
see
after
their
needs
he
inspected
the
food
and
drink
the
others
brought
in
gold
vessels
and
dishes
and
tasted
each
before
he
placed
it
before
his
guests
while
they
ate
olmec
sat
in
silence
on
his
ivory
seat
watching
them
from
under
his
broad
black
brows
tascela
sat
beside
him
chin
cupped
in
her
hands
and
her
elbows
resting
on
her
knees
her
dark
enigmatic
eyes
burning
with
a
mysterious
light
never
left
valeria
supple
figure
behind
her
seat
a
sullen
handsome
girl
waved
an
fan
with
a
slow
rhythm
the
food
was
fruit
of
an
exotic
kind
unfamiliar
to
the
wanderers
but
very
palatable
and
the
drink
was
a
light
crimson
wine
that
carried
a
heady
tang
you
have
come
from
afar
said
olmec
at
last
i
have
read
the
books
of
our
fathers
aquilonia
lies
beyond
the
lands
of
the
stygians
and
the
shemites
beyond
argos
and
zingara
and
cimmeria
lies
beyond
aquilonia
we
have
each
a
roving
foot
answered
conan
carelessly
how
you
won
through
the
forest
is
a
wonder
to
me
quoth
olmec
in
bygone
days
a
thousand
scarcely
were
able
to
carve
a
road
through
its
perils
we
encountered
a
monstrosity
about
the
size
of
a
mastodon
said
conan
casually
holding
out
his
wine
goblet
which
techotl
filled
with
evident
pleasure
but
when
we
killed
it
we
had
no
further
trouble
the
wine
vessel
slipped
from
techotl
hand
to
crash
on
the
floor
his
dusky
skin
went
ashy
olmec
started
to
his
feet
an
image
of
stunned
amazement
and
a
low
gasp
of
awe
or
terror
breathed
up
from
the
others
some
slipped
to
their
knees
as
if
their
legs
would
not
support
them
only
tascela
seemed
not
to
have
heard
conan
glared
about
him
bewilderedly
what
the
matter
what
are
you
gaping
about
you
you
slew
the
god
i
killed
a
dragon
why
not
it
was
trying
to
gobble
us
up
but
dragons
are
immortal
exclaimed
olmec
they
slay
each
other
but
no
man
ever
killed
a
dragon
the
thousand
of
our
ancestors
who
fought
their
way
to
xuchotl
could
not
prevail
against
them
their
swords
broke
like
twigs
against
their
scales
if
your
ancestors
had
thought
to
dip
their
spears
in
the
poisonous
juice
of
derketa
apples
quoth
conan
with
his
mouth
full
and
jab
them
in
the
eyes
or
mouth
or
somewhere
like
that
they
have
seen
that
dragons
are
not
more
immortal
than
any
other
chunk
of
beef
the
carcass
lies
at
the
edge
of
the
trees
just
within
the
forest
if
you
believe
me
go
and
look
for
yourself
olmec
shook
his
head
not
in
disbelief
but
in
wonder
it
was
because
of
the
dragons
that
our
ancestors
took
refuge
in
xuchotl
said
he
they
dared
not
pass
through
the
plain
and
plunge
into
the
forest
beyond
scores
of
them
were
seized
and
devoured
by
the
monsters
before
they
could
reach
the
city
then
your
ancestors
did
build
xuchotl
asked
valeria
it
was
ancient
when
they
first
came
into
the
land
how
long
it
had
stood
here
not
even
its
degenerate
inhabitants
knew
your
people
came
from
lake
zuad
questioned
conan
aye
more
than
half
a
century
ago
a
tribe
of
the
tlazitlans
rebelled
against
the
stygian
king
and
being
defeated
in
battle
fled
southward
for
many
weeks
they
wandered
over
grasslands
desert
and
hills
and
at
last
they
came
into
the
great
forest
a
thousand
with
their
women
and
children
it
was
in
the
forest
that
the
dragons
fell
upon
them
and
tore
many
to
pieces
so
the
people
fled
in
a
frenzy
of
fear
before
them
and
at
last
came
into
the
plain
and
saw
the
city
of
xuchotl
in
the
midst
of
it
they
camped
before
the
city
not
daring
to
leave
the
plain
for
the
night
was
made
hideous
with
the
noise
of
the
battling
monsters
throughout
the
forest
they
made
war
incessantly
upon
one
another
yet
they
came
not
into
the
plain
the
people
of
the
city
shut
their
gates
and
shot
arrows
at
our
people
from
the
walls
the
tlazitlans
were
imprisoned
on
the
plain
as
if
the
ring
of
the
forest
had
been
a
great
wall
for
to
venture
into
the
woods
would
have
been
madness
that
night
there
came
secretly
to
their
camp
a
slave
from
the
city
one
of
their
own
blood
who
with
a
band
of
exploring
soldiers
had
wandered
into
the
forest
long
before
when
he
was
a
young
man
the
dragons
had
devoured
all
his
companions
but
he
had
been
taken
into
the
city
to
dwell
in
servitude
his
name
was
tolkemec
a
flame
lighted
the
dark
eyes
at
mention
of
the
name
and
some
of
the
people
muttered
obscenely
and
spat
he
promised
to
open
the
gates
to
the
warriors
he
asked
only
that
all
captives
taken
be
delivered
into
his
hands
at
dawn
he
opened
the
gates
the
warriors
swarmed
in
and
the
halls
of
xuchotl
ran
red
only
a
few
hundred
folk
dwelt
there
decaying
remnants
of
a
once
great
race
tolkemec
said
they
came
from
the
east
long
ago
from
old
kosala
when
the
ancestors
of
those
who
now
dwell
in
kosala
came
up
from
the
south
and
drove
forth
the
original
inhabitants
of
the
land
they
wandered
far
westward
and
finally
found
this
plain
inhabited
then
by
a
tribe
of
black
people
these
they
enslaved
and
set
to
building
a
city
from
the
hills
to
the
east
they
brought
jade
and
marble
and
lapis
lazuli
and
gold
silver
and
copper
herds
of
elephants
provided
them
with
ivory
when
their
city
was
completed
they
slew
all
the
black
slaves
and
their
magicians
made
a
terrible
magic
to
guard
the
city
for
by
their
necromantic
arts
they
the
dragons
which
had
once
dwelt
in
this
lost
land
and
whose
monstrous
bones
they
found
in
the
forest
those
bones
they
clothed
in
flesh
and
life
and
the
living
beasts
walked
the
earth
as
they
walked
it
when
time
was
young
but
the
wizards
wove
a
spell
that
kept
them
in
the
forest
and
they
came
not
into
the
plain
so
for
many
centuries
the
people
of
xuchotl
dwelt
in
their
city
cultivating
the
fertile
plain
until
their
wise
men
learned
how
to
grow
fruit
within
the
city
fruit
which
is
not
planted
in
soil
but
obtains
its
nourishment
out
of
the
air
and
then
they
let
the
irrigation
ditches
run
dry
and
dwelt
more
and
more
in
luxurious
sloth
until
decay
seized
them
they
were
a
dying
race
when
our
ancestors
broke
through
the
forest
and
came
into
the
plain
their
wizards
had
died
and
the
people
had
forgot
their
ancient
necromancy
they
could
fight
neither
by
sorcery
nor
the
sword
well
our
fathers
slew
the
people
of
xuchotl
all
except
a
hundred
which
were
given
living
into
the
hands
of
tolkemec
who
had
been
their
slave
and
for
many
days
and
nights
the
halls
to
their
screams
under
the
agony
of
his
tortures
so
the
tlazitlans
dwelt
here
for
a
while
in
peace
ruled
by
the
brothers
tecuhltli
and
xotalanc
and
by
tolkemec
tolkemec
took
a
girl
of
the
tribe
to
wife
and
because
he
had
opened
the
gates
and
because
he
knew
many
of
the
arts
of
the
xuchotlans
he
shared
the
rule
of
the
tribe
with
the
brothers
who
had
led
the
rebellion
and
the
flight
for
a
few
years
then
they
dwelt
at
peace
within
the
city
doing
little
but
eating
drinking
and
making
love
and
raising
children
there
was
no
necessity
to
till
the
plain
for
tolkemec
taught
them
how
to
cultivate
the
fruits
besides
the
slaying
of
the
xuchotlans
broke
the
spell
that
held
the
dragons
in
the
forest
and
they
came
nightly
and
bellowed
about
the
gates
of
the
city
the
plain
ran
red
with
the
blood
of
their
eternal
warfare
and
it
was
then
that
he
bit
his
tongue
in
the
midst
of
the
sentence
then
presently
continued
but
valeria
and
conan
felt
that
he
had
checked
an
admission
he
had
considered
unwise
five
years
they
dwelt
in
peace
then
olmec
eyes
rested
briefly
on
the
silent
woman
at
his
side
xotalanc
took
a
woman
to
wife
a
woman
whom
both
tecuhltli
and
old
tolkemec
desired
in
his
madness
tecuhltli
stole
her
from
her
husband
aye
she
went
willingly
enough
tolkemec
to
spite
xotalanc
aided
tecuhltli
xotalanc
demanded
that
she
be
given
back
to
him
and
the
council
of
the
tribe
decided
that
the
matter
should
be
left
to
the
woman
she
chose
to
remain
with
tecuhltli
in
wrath
xotalanc
sought
to
take
her
back
by
force
and
the
retainers
of
the
brothers
came
to
blows
in
the
great
hall
there
was
much
bitterness
blood
was
shed
on
both
sides
the
quarrel
became
a
feud
the
feud
an
open
war
from
the
welter
three
factions
emerged
tecuhltli
xotalanc
and
tolkemec
already
in
the
days
of
peace
they
had
divided
the
city
between
them
tecuhltli
dwelt
in
the
western
quarter
of
the
city
xotalanc
in
the
eastern
and
tolkemec
with
his
family
by
the
southern
gate
anger
and
resentment
and
jealousy
blossomed
into
bloodshed
and
rape
and
murder
once
the
sword
was
drawn
there
was
no
turning
back
for
blood
called
for
blood
and
vengeance
followed
swift
on
the
heels
of
atrocity
tecuhltli
fought
with
xotalanc
and
tolkemec
aided
first
one
and
then
the
other
betraying
each
faction
as
it
fitted
his
purposes
tecuhltli
and
his
people
withdrew
into
the
quarter
of
the
western
gate
where
we
now
sit
xuchotl
is
built
in
the
shape
of
an
oval
tecuhltli
which
took
its
name
from
its
prince
occupies
the
western
end
of
the
oval
the
people
blocked
up
all
doors
connecting
the
quarter
with
the
rest
of
the
city
except
one
on
each
floor
which
could
be
defended
easily
they
went
into
the
pits
below
the
city
and
built
a
wall
cutting
off
the
western
end
of
the
catacombs
where
lie
the
bodies
of
the
ancient
xuchotlans
and
of
those
tlazitlans
slain
in
the
feud
they
dwelt
as
in
a
besieged
castle
making
sorties
and
forays
on
their
enemies
the
people
of
xotalanc
likewise
fortified
the
eastern
quarter
of
the
city
and
tolkemec
did
likewise
with
the
quarter
by
the
southern
gate
the
central
part
of
the
city
was
left
bare
and
uninhabited
those
empty
halls
and
chambers
became
a
battleground
and
a
region
of
brooding
terror
tolkemec
warred
on
both
clans
he
was
a
fiend
in
the
form
of
a
human
worse
than
xotalanc
he
knew
many
secrets
of
the
city
he
never
told
the
others
from
the
crypts
of
the
catacombs
he
plundered
the
dead
of
their
grisly
secrets
secrets
of
ancient
kings
and
wizards
long
forgotten
by
the
degenerate
xuchotlans
our
ancestors
slew
but
all
his
magic
did
not
aid
him
the
night
we
of
tecuhltli
stormed
his
castle
and
butchered
all
his
people
tolkemec
we
tortured
for
many
days
his
voice
sank
to
a
caressing
slur
and
a
look
grew
in
his
eyes
as
if
he
looked
back
over
the
years
to
a
scene
which
caused
him
intense
pleasure
aye
we
kept
the
life
in
him
until
he
screamed
for
death
as
for
a
bride
at
last
we
took
him
living
from
the
torture
chamber
and
cast
him
into
a
dungeon
for
the
rats
to
gnaw
as
he
died
from
that
dungeon
somehow
he
managed
to
escape
and
dragged
himself
into
the
catacombs
there
without
doubt
he
died
for
the
only
way
out
of
the
catacombs
beneath
tecuhltli
is
through
tecuhltli
and
he
never
emerged
by
that
way
his
bones
were
never
found
and
the
superstitious
among
our
people
swear
that
his
ghost
haunts
the
crypts
to
this
day
wailing
among
the
bones
of
the
dead
twelve
years
ago
we
butchered
the
people
of
tolkemec
but
the
feud
raged
on
between
tecuhltli
and
xotalanc
as
it
will
rage
until
the
last
man
the
last
woman
is
dead
it
was
fifty
years
ago
that
tecuhltli
stole
the
wife
of
xotalanc
half
a
century
the
feud
has
endured
i
was
born
in
it
all
in
this
chamber
except
tascela
were
born
in
it
we
expect
to
die
in
it
we
are
a
dying
race
even
as
those
xuchotlans
our
ancestors
slew
when
the
feud
began
there
were
hundreds
in
each
faction
now
we
of
tecuhltli
number
only
these
you
see
before
you
and
the
men
who
guard
the
four
doors
forty
in
all
how
many
xotalancas
there
are
we
do
not
know
but
i
doubt
if
they
are
much
more
numerous
than
we
for
fifteen
years
no
children
have
been
born
to
us
and
we
have
seen
none
among
the
xotalancas
we
are
dying
but
before
we
die
we
will
slay
as
many
of
the
men
of
xotalanc
as
the
gods
permit
and
with
his
weird
eyes
blazing
olmec
spoke
long
of
that
grisly
feud
fought
out
in
silent
chambers
and
dim
halls
under
the
blaze
of
the
green
on
floors
smoldering
with
the
flames
of
hell
and
splashed
with
deeper
crimson
from
severed
veins
in
that
long
butchery
a
whole
generation
had
perished
xotalanc
was
dead
long
ago
slain
in
a
grim
battle
on
an
ivory
stair
tecuhltli
was
dead
flayed
alive
by
the
maddened
xotalancas
who
had
captured
him
without
emotion
olmec
told
of
hideous
battles
fought
in
black
corridors
of
ambushes
on
twisting
stairs
and
red
butcheries
with
a
redder
more
abysmal
gleam
in
his
deep
dark
eyes
he
told
of
men
and
women
flayed
alive
mutilated
and
dismembered
of
captives
howling
under
tortures
so
ghastly
that
even
the
barbarous
cimmerian
grunted
no
wonder
techotl
had
trembled
with
the
terror
of
capture
yet
he
had
gone
forth
to
slay
if
he
could
driven
by
hate
that
was
stronger
than
his
fear
olmec
spoke
further
of
dark
and
mysterious
matters
of
black
magic
and
wizardry
conjured
out
of
the
black
night
of
the
catacombs
of
weird
creatures
invoked
out
of
darkness
for
horrible
allies
in
these
things
the
xotalancas
had
the
advantage
for
it
was
in
the
eastern
catacombs
where
lay
the
bones
of
the
greatest
wizards
of
the
ancient
xuchotlans
with
their
immemorial
secrets
valeria
listened
with
morbid
fascination
the
feud
had
become
a
terrible
elemental
power
driving
the
people
of
xuchotl
inexorably
on
to
doom
and
extinction
it
filled
their
whole
lives
they
were
born
in
it
and
they
expected
to
die
in
it
they
never
left
their
barricaded
castle
except
to
steal
forth
into
the
halls
of
silence
that
lay
between
the
opposing
fortresses
to
slay
and
be
slain
sometimes
the
raiders
returned
with
frantic
captives
or
with
grim
tokens
of
victory
in
fight
sometimes
they
did
not
return
at
all
or
returned
only
as
severed
limbs
cast
down
before
the
bolted
bronze
doors
it
was
a
ghastly
unreal
nightmare
existence
these
people
lived
shut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
world
caught
together
like
rabid
rats
in
the
same
trap
butchering
one
another
through
the
years
crouching
and
creeping
through
the
sunless
corridors
to
maim
and
torture
and
murder
while
olmec
talked
valeria
felt
the
blazing
eyes
of
tascela
fixed
upon
her
the
princess
seemed
not
to
hear
what
olmec
was
saying
her
expression
as
he
narrated
victories
or
defeats
did
not
mirror
the
wild
rage
or
fiendish
exultation
that
alternated
on
the
faces
of
the
other
tecuhltli
the
feud
that
was
an
obsession
to
her
clansmen
seemed
meaningless
to
her
valeria
found
her
indifferent
callousness
more
repugnant
than
olmec
naked
ferocity
and
we
can
never
leave
the
city
said
olmec
for
fifty
years
no
one
has
left
it
except
those
again
he
checked
himself
even
without
the
peril
of
the
dragons
he
continued
we
who
were
born
and
raised
in
the
city
would
not
dare
leave
it
we
have
never
set
foot
outside
the
walls
we
are
not
accustomed
to
the
open
sky
and
the
naked
sun
no
we
were
born
in
xuchotl
and
in
xuchotl
we
shall
die
well
said
conan
with
your
leave
we
take
our
chances
with
the
dragons
this
feud
is
none
of
our
business
if
you
show
us
to
the
west
gate
we
be
on
our
way
tascela
hands
clenched
and
she
started
to
speak
but
olmec
interrupted
her
it
is
nearly
nightfall
if
you
wander
forth
into
the
plain
by
night
you
will
certainly
fall
prey
to
the
dragons
we
crossed
it
last
night
and
slept
in
the
open
without
seeing
any
returned
conan
tascela
smiled
mirthlessly
you
dare
not
leave
xuchotl
conan
glared
at
her
with
instinctive
antagonism
she
was
not
looking
at
him
but
at
the
woman
opposite
him
i
think
they
dare
retorted
olmec
but
look
you
conan
and
valeria
the
gods
must
have
sent
you
to
us
to
cast
victory
into
the
laps
of
the
tecuhltli
you
are
professional
fighters
why
not
fight
for
us
we
have
wealth
in
abundance
precious
jewels
are
as
common
in
xuchotl
as
cobblestones
are
in
the
cities
of
the
world
some
the
xuchotlans
brought
with
them
from
kosala
some
like
the
they
found
in
the
hills
to
the
east
aid
us
to
wipe
out
the
xotalancas
and
we
will
give
you
all
the
jewels
you
can
carry
and
will
you
help
us
destroy
the
dragons
asked
valeria
with
bows
and
poisoned
arrows
thirty
men
could
slay
all
the
dragons
in
the
forest
aye
replied
olmec
promptly
we
have
forgotten
the
use
of
the
bow
in
years
of
fighting
but
we
can
learn
again
what
do
you
say
valeria
inquired
of
conan
we
both
penniless
vagabonds
he
grinned
hardily
i
as
soon
kill
xotalancas
as
anybody
then
you
agree
exclaimed
olmec
while
techotl
fairly
hugged
himself
with
delight
aye
and
now
suppose
you
show
us
chambers
where
we
can
sleep
so
we
can
be
fresh
tomorrow
for
the
beginning
of
the
slaying
olmec
nodded
and
waved
a
hand
and
techotl
and
a
woman
led
the
adventurers
into
a
corridor
which
led
through
a
door
off
to
the
left
of
the
jade
dais
a
glance
back
showed
valeria
olmec
sitting
on
his
throne
chin
on
knotted
fist
staring
after
them
his
eyes
burned
with
a
weird
flame
tascela
leaned
back
in
her
seat
whispering
to
the
maid
yasala
who
leaned
over
her
shoulder
her
ear
to
the
moving
lips
the
hallway
was
not
so
broad
as
most
they
had
traversed
but
it
was
long
presently
the
woman
halted
opened
a
door
and
drew
aside
for
valeria
to
enter
wait
a
minute
growled
conan
where
do
i
sleep
techotl
pointed
to
a
chamber
across
the
hallway
but
one
door
farther
down
conan
hesitated
and
seemed
inclined
to
raise
an
objection
but
valeria
smiled
spitefully
at
him
and
shut
the
door
in
his
face
he
muttered
something
uncomplimentary
about
women
in
general
and
strode
off
down
the
corridor
after
techotl
in
the
ornate
chamber
where
he
was
to
sleep
he
glanced
up
at
the
skylights
some
were
wide
enough
to
admit
the
body
of
a
slender
man
supposing
the
glass
were
broken
why
do
the
xotalancas
come
over
the
roofs
and
shatter
those
skylights
he
asked
they
can
not
be
broken
answered
techotl
besides
the
roofs
would
be
hard
to
clamber
over
they
are
mostly
spires
and
domes
and
steep
ridges
he
volunteered
more
information
about
the
castle
of
tecuhltli
like
the
rest
of
the
city
it
contained
four
stories
or
tiers
of
chambers
with
towers
jutting
up
from
the
roof
each
tier
was
named
indeed
the
people
of
xuchotl
had
a
name
for
each
chamber
hall
and
stair
in
the
city
as
people
of
more
normal
cities
designate
streets
and
quarters
in
tecuhltli
the
floors
were
named
the
eagle
tier
the
ape
tier
the
tiger
tier
and
the
serpent
tier
in
the
order
as
enumerated
the
eagle
tier
being
the
highest
or
fourth
floor
who
is
tascela
asked
conan
olmec
wife
techotl
shuddered
and
glanced
furtively
about
him
before
answering
no
she
is
tascela
she
was
the
wife
of
xotalanc
the
woman
tecuhltli
stole
to
start
the
feud
what
are
you
talking
about
demanded
conan
that
woman
is
beautiful
and
young
are
you
trying
to
tell
me
that
she
was
a
wife
fifty
years
ago
aye
i
swear
it
she
was
a
woman
when
the
tlazitlans
journeyed
from
lake
zuad
it
was
because
the
king
of
stygia
desired
her
for
a
concubine
that
xotalanc
and
his
brother
rebelled
and
fled
into
the
wilderness
she
is
a
witch
who
possesses
the
secret
of
perpetual
youth
what
that
asked
conan
techotl
shuddered
again
ask
me
not
i
dare
not
speak
it
is
too
grisly
even
for
xuchotl
and
touching
his
finger
to
his
lips
he
glided
from
the
chamber
scent
of
black
valeria
unbuckled
her
and
laid
it
with
the
sheathed
weapon
on
the
couch
where
she
meant
to
sleep
she
noted
that
the
doors
were
supplied
with
bolts
and
asked
where
they
led
those
lead
into
adjoining
chambers
answered
the
woman
indicating
the
doors
on
right
and
left
that
one
pointing
to
a
door
opposite
that
which
opened
into
the
corridor
leads
to
a
corridor
which
runs
to
a
stair
that
descends
into
the
catacombs
do
not
fear
naught
can
harm
you
here
who
spoke
of
fear
snapped
valeria
i
just
like
to
know
what
sort
of
harbor
i
dropping
anchor
in
no
i
do
want
you
to
sleep
at
the
foot
of
my
couch
i
not
accustomed
to
being
waited
on
not
by
women
anyway
you
have
my
leave
to
go
alone
in
the
room
the
pirate
shot
the
bolts
on
all
the
doors
kicked
off
her
boots
and
stretched
luxuriously
out
on
the
couch
she
imagined
conan
similarly
situated
across
the
corridor
but
her
feminine
vanity
prompted
her
to
visualize
him
as
scowling
and
muttering
with
chagrin
as
he
cast
himself
on
his
solitary
couch
and
she
grinned
with
gleeful
malice
as
she
prepared
herself
for
slumber
outside
night
had
fallen
in
the
halls
of
xuchotl
the
green
blazed
like
the
eyes
of
prehistoric
cats
somewhere
among
the
dark
towers
a
night
wind
moaned
like
a
restless
spirit
through
the
dim
passages
stealthy
figures
began
stealing
like
disembodied
shadows
valeria
awoke
suddenly
on
her
couch
in
the
dusky
emerald
glow
of
the
she
saw
a
shadowy
figure
bending
over
her
for
a
bemused
instant
the
apparition
seemed
part
of
the
dream
she
had
been
dreaming
she
had
seemed
to
lie
on
the
couch
in
the
chamber
as
she
was
actually
lying
while
over
her
pulsed
and
throbbed
a
gigantic
black
blossom
so
enormous
that
it
hid
the
ceiling
its
exotic
perfume
pervaded
her
being
inducing
a
delicious
sensuous
languor
that
was
something
more
and
less
than
sleep
she
was
sinking
into
scented
billows
of
insensible
bliss
when
something
touched
her
face
so
supersensitive
were
her
drugged
senses
that
the
light
touch
was
like
a
dislocating
impact
jolting
her
rudely
into
full
wakefulness
then
it
was
that
she
saw
not
a
gargantuan
blossom
but
a
woman
standing
above
her
with
the
realization
came
anger
and
instant
action
the
woman
turned
lithely
but
before
she
could
run
valeria
was
on
her
feet
and
had
caught
her
arm
she
fought
like
a
wildcat
for
an
instant
and
then
subsided
as
she
felt
herself
crushed
by
the
superior
strength
of
her
captor
the
pirate
wrenched
the
woman
around
to
face
her
caught
her
chin
with
her
free
hand
and
forced
her
captive
to
meet
her
gaze
it
was
the
sullen
yasala
tascela
maid
what
the
devil
were
you
doing
bending
over
me
what
that
in
your
hand
the
woman
made
no
reply
but
sought
to
cast
away
the
object
valeria
twisted
her
arm
around
in
front
of
her
and
the
thing
fell
to
the
floor
a
great
black
exotic
blossom
on
a
stem
large
as
a
woman
head
to
be
sure
but
tiny
beside
the
exaggerated
vision
she
had
seen
the
black
lotus
said
valeria
between
her
teeth
the
blossom
whose
scent
brings
deep
sleep
you
were
trying
to
drug
me
if
you
accidentally
touched
my
face
with
the
petals
you
have
why
did
you
do
it
what
your
game
yasala
maintained
a
sulky
silence
and
with
an
oath
valeria
whirled
her
around
forced
her
to
her
knees
and
twisted
her
arm
up
behind
her
back
tell
me
or
i
tear
your
arm
out
of
its
socket
yasala
squirmed
in
anguish
as
her
arm
was
forced
excruciatingly
up
between
her
but
a
violent
shaking
of
her
head
was
the
only
answer
she
made
slut
valeria
cast
her
from
her
to
sprawl
on
the
floor
the
pirate
glared
at
the
prostrate
figure
with
blazing
eyes
fear
and
the
memory
of
tascela
burning
eyes
stirred
in
her
rousing
all
her
tigerish
instincts
of
these
people
were
decadent
any
sort
of
perversity
might
be
expected
to
be
encountered
among
them
but
valeria
sensed
here
something
that
moved
behind
the
scenes
some
secret
terror
fouler
than
common
degeneracy
fear
and
revulsion
of
this
weird
city
swept
her
these
people
were
neither
sane
nor
normal
she
began
to
doubt
if
they
were
even
human
madness
smoldered
in
the
eyes
of
them
all
all
except
the
cruel
cryptic
eyes
of
tascela
which
held
secrets
and
mysteries
more
abysmal
than
madness
she
lifted
her
head
and
listened
intently
the
halls
of
xuchotl
were
as
silent
as
if
it
were
in
reality
a
dead
city
the
green
jewels
bathed
the
chamber
in
a
nightmare
glow
in
which
the
eyes
of
the
woman
on
the
floor
glittered
eerily
up
at
her
a
thrill
of
panic
throbbed
through
valeria
driving
the
last
vestige
of
mercy
from
her
fierce
soul
why
did
you
try
to
drug
me
she
muttered
grasping
the
woman
black
hair
and
forcing
her
head
back
to
glare
into
her
sullen
eyes
did
tascela
send
you
no
answer
valeria
cursed
venomously
and
slapped
the
woman
first
on
one
cheek
and
then
the
other
the
blows
resounded
through
the
room
but
yasala
made
no
outcry
why
do
you
scream
demanded
valeria
savagely
do
you
fear
someone
will
hear
you
whom
do
you
fear
tascela
olmec
conan
yasala
made
no
reply
she
crouched
watching
her
captor
with
eyes
baleful
as
those
of
a
basilisk
stubborn
silence
always
fans
anger
valeria
turned
and
tore
a
handful
of
cords
from
a
hanging
you
sulky
slut
she
said
between
her
teeth
i
going
to
strip
you
stark
naked
and
tie
you
across
that
couch
and
whip
you
until
you
tell
me
what
you
were
doing
here
and
who
sent
you
yasala
made
no
verbal
protest
nor
did
she
offer
any
resistance
as
valeria
carried
out
the
first
part
of
her
threat
with
a
fury
that
her
captive
obstinacy
only
sharpened
then
for
a
space
there
was
no
sound
in
the
chamber
except
the
whistle
and
crackle
of
silken
cords
on
naked
flesh
yasala
could
not
move
her
hands
or
feet
her
body
writhed
and
quivered
under
the
chastisement
her
head
swayed
from
side
to
side
in
rhythm
with
the
blows
her
teeth
were
sunk
into
her
lower
lip
and
a
trickle
of
blood
began
as
the
punishment
continued
but
she
did
not
cry
out
the
pliant
cords
made
no
great
sound
as
they
encountered
the
quivering
body
of
the
captive
only
a
sharp
crackling
snap
but
each
cord
left
a
red
streak
across
yasala
dark
flesh
valeria
inflicted
the
punishment
with
all
the
strength
of
her
arm
with
all
the
mercilessness
acquired
during
a
life
where
pain
and
torment
were
daily
happenings
and
with
all
the
cynical
ingenuity
which
only
a
woman
displays
toward
a
woman
yasala
suffered
more
physically
and
mentally
than
she
would
have
suffered
under
a
lash
wielded
by
a
man
however
strong
it
was
the
application
of
this
feminine
cynicism
which
at
last
tamed
yasala
a
low
whimper
escaped
from
her
lips
and
valeria
paused
arm
lifted
and
raked
back
a
damp
yellow
lock
well
are
you
going
to
talk
she
demanded
i
can
keep
this
up
all
night
if
necessary
mercy
whispered
the
woman
i
will
tell
valeria
cut
the
cords
from
her
wrists
and
ankles
and
pulled
her
to
her
feet
yasala
sank
down
on
the
couch
half
reclining
on
one
bare
hip
supporting
herself
on
her
arm
and
writhing
at
the
contact
of
her
smarting
flesh
with
the
couch
she
was
trembling
in
every
limb
wine
she
begged
indicating
with
a
quivering
hand
a
gold
vessel
on
an
ivory
table
let
me
drink
i
am
weak
with
pain
then
i
will
tell
you
all
valeria
picked
up
the
vessel
and
yasala
rose
unsteadily
to
receive
it
she
took
it
raised
it
toward
her
lips
then
dashed
the
contents
full
into
the
aquilonian
face
valeria
reeled
backward
shaking
and
clawing
the
stinging
liquid
out
of
her
eyes
through
a
smarting
mist
she
saw
yasala
dart
across
the
room
fling
back
a
bolt
throw
open
the
door
and
run
down
the
hall
the
pirate
was
after
her
instantly
sword
out
and
murder
in
her
heart
but
yasala
had
the
start
and
she
ran
with
the
nervous
agility
of
a
woman
who
has
just
been
whipped
to
the
point
of
hysterical
frenzy
she
rounded
a
corner
in
the
corridor
yards
ahead
of
valeria
and
when
the
pirate
turned
it
she
saw
only
an
empty
hall
and
at
the
other
end
a
door
that
gaped
blackly
a
damp
moldy
scent
reeked
up
from
it
and
valeria
shivered
that
must
be
the
door
that
led
to
the
catacombs
yasala
had
taken
refuge
among
the
dead
valeria
advanced
to
the
door
and
looked
down
a
flight
of
stone
steps
that
vanished
quickly
into
utter
blackness
evidently
it
was
a
shaft
that
led
straight
to
the
pits
below
the
city
without
opening
upon
any
of
the
lower
floors
she
shivered
slightly
at
the
thought
of
the
thousands
of
corpses
lying
in
their
stone
crypts
down
there
wrapped
in
their
moldering
cloths
she
had
no
intention
of
groping
her
way
down
those
stone
steps
yasala
doubtless
knew
every
turn
and
twist
of
the
subterranean
tunnels
she
was
turning
back
baffled
and
furious
when
a
sobbing
cry
welled
up
from
the
blackness
it
seemed
to
come
from
a
great
depth
but
human
words
were
faintly
distinguishable
and
the
voice
was
that
of
a
woman
oh
help
help
in
set
name
ahhh
it
trailed
away
and
valeria
thought
she
caught
the
echo
of
a
ghostly
tittering
valeria
felt
her
skin
crawl
what
had
happened
to
yasala
down
there
in
the
thick
blackness
there
was
no
doubt
that
it
had
been
she
who
had
cried
out
but
what
peril
could
have
befallen
her
was
a
xotalanca
lurking
down
there
olmec
had
assured
them
that
the
catacombs
below
tecuhltli
were
walled
off
from
the
rest
too
securely
for
their
enemies
to
break
through
besides
that
tittering
had
not
sounded
like
a
human
being
at
all
valeria
hurried
back
down
the
corridor
not
stopping
to
close
the
door
that
opened
on
the
stair
regaining
her
chamber
she
closed
the
door
and
shot
the
bolt
behind
her
she
pulled
on
her
boots
and
buckled
her
about
her
she
was
determined
to
make
her
way
to
conan
room
and
urge
him
if
he
still
lived
to
join
her
in
an
attempt
to
fight
their
way
out
of
that
city
of
devils
but
even
as
she
reached
the
door
that
opened
into
the
corridor
a
scream
of
agony
rang
through
the
halls
followed
by
the
stamp
of
running
feet
and
the
loud
clangor
of
swords
twenty
red
two
warriors
lounged
in
the
guardroom
on
the
floor
known
as
the
tier
of
the
eagle
their
attitude
was
casual
though
habitually
alert
an
attack
on
the
great
bronze
door
from
without
was
always
a
possibility
but
for
many
years
no
such
assault
had
been
attempted
on
either
side
the
strangers
are
strong
allies
said
one
olmec
will
move
against
the
enemy
tomorrow
i
believe
he
spoke
as
a
soldier
in
a
war
might
have
spoken
in
the
miniature
world
of
xuchotl
each
handful
of
feudists
was
an
army
and
the
empty
halls
between
the
castles
was
the
country
over
which
they
campaigned
illustration
even
as
he
shifted
he
hurled
the
knife
the
other
meditated
for
a
space
suppose
with
their
aid
we
destroy
xotalanc
he
said
what
then
xatmec
why
returned
xatmec
we
will
drive
red
nails
for
them
all
the
captives
we
will
burn
and
flay
and
quarter
but
afterward
pursued
the
other
after
we
have
slain
them
all
will
it
not
seem
strange
to
have
no
foes
to
fight
all
my
life
i
have
fought
and
hated
the
xotalancas
with
the
feud
ended
what
is
left
xatmec
shrugged
his
shoulders
his
thoughts
had
never
gone
beyond
the
destruction
of
their
foes
they
could
not
go
beyond
that
suddenly
both
men
stiffened
at
a
noise
outside
the
door
to
the
door
xatmec
hissed
the
last
speaker
i
shall
look
through
the
eye
xatmec
sword
in
hand
leaned
against
the
bronze
door
straining
his
ear
to
hear
through
the
metal
his
mate
looked
into
the
mirror
he
started
convulsively
men
were
clustered
thickly
outside
the
door
grim
men
with
swords
gripped
in
their
teeth
their
fingers
thrust
into
their
one
who
wore
a
feathered
had
a
set
of
pipes
which
he
set
to
his
lips
and
even
as
the
tecuhltli
started
to
shout
a
warning
the
pipes
began
to
skirl
the
cry
died
in
the
guard
throat
as
the
thin
weird
piping
penetrated
the
metal
door
and
smote
on
his
ears
xatmec
leaned
frozen
against
the
door
as
if
paralyzed
in
that
position
his
face
was
that
of
a
wooden
image
his
expression
one
of
horrified
listening
the
other
guard
farther
removed
from
the
source
of
the
sound
yet
sensed
the
horror
of
what
was
taking
place
the
grisly
threat
that
lay
in
that
demoniac
fifing
he
felt
the
weird
strains
plucking
like
unseen
fingers
at
the
tissues
of
his
brain
filling
him
with
alien
emotions
and
impulses
of
madness
but
with
a
effort
he
broke
the
spell
and
shrieked
a
warning
in
a
voice
he
did
not
recognize
as
his
own
but
even
as
he
cried
out
the
music
changed
to
an
unbearable
shrilling
that
was
like
a
knife
in
the
xatmec
screamed
in
sudden
agony
and
all
the
sanity
went
out
of
his
face
like
a
flame
blown
out
in
a
wind
like
a
madman
he
ripped
loose
the
chain
tore
open
the
door
and
rushed
out
into
the
hall
sword
lifted
before
his
mate
could
stop
him
a
dozen
blades
struck
him
down
and
over
his
mangled
body
the
xotalancas
surged
into
the
guardroom
with
a
yell
that
sent
the
unwonted
echoes
reverberating
his
brain
reeling
from
the
shock
of
it
all
the
remaining
guard
leaped
to
meet
them
with
goring
spear
the
horror
of
the
sorcery
he
had
just
witnessed
was
submerged
in
the
stunning
realization
that
the
enemy
were
in
tecuhltli
and
as
his
spearhead
ripped
through
a
belly
he
knew
no
more
for
a
swinging
sword
crushed
his
skull
even
as
warriors
came
pouring
in
from
the
chambers
behind
the
guardroom
it
was
the
yelling
of
men
and
the
clanging
of
steel
that
brought
conan
bounding
from
his
couch
wide
awake
and
broadsword
in
hand
in
an
instant
he
had
reached
the
door
and
flung
it
open
and
was
glaring
out
into
the
corridor
just
as
techotl
rushed
up
it
eyes
blazing
madly
the
xotalancas
he
screamed
in
a
voice
hardly
human
are
within
the
door
conan
ran
down
the
corridor
even
as
valeria
emerged
from
her
chamber
what
the
devil
is
it
she
called
techotl
says
the
xotalancas
are
in
he
answered
hurriedly
that
racket
sounds
like
it
with
the
tecuhltli
on
their
heels
they
burst
into
the
throne
room
and
were
confronted
by
a
scene
beyond
the
most
frantic
dream
of
blood
and
fury
twenty
men
and
women
their
black
hair
streaming
and
the
white
skulls
gleaming
on
their
breasts
were
locked
in
combat
with
the
people
of
tecuhltli
the
women
on
both
sides
fought
as
madly
as
the
men
and
already
the
room
and
the
hall
beyond
were
strewn
with
corpses
olmec
naked
but
for
a
was
fighting
before
his
throne
and
as
the
adventurers
entered
tascela
ran
from
an
inner
chamber
with
a
sword
in
her
hand
xatmec
and
his
mate
were
dead
so
there
was
none
to
tell
the
tecuhltli
how
their
foes
had
found
their
way
into
their
citadel
nor
was
there
any
to
say
what
had
prompted
that
mad
attempt
but
the
losses
of
the
xotalancas
had
been
greater
their
position
more
desperate
than
the
tecuhltli
had
known
the
maiming
of
their
scaly
ally
the
destruction
of
the
burning
skull
and
the
news
gasped
by
a
dying
man
that
mysterious
allies
had
joined
their
enemies
had
driven
them
to
the
frenzy
of
desperation
and
the
wild
determination
to
die
dealing
death
to
their
ancient
foes
the
tecuhltli
recovering
from
the
first
stunning
shock
of
the
surprise
that
had
swept
them
back
into
the
throne
room
and
littered
the
floor
with
their
corpses
fought
back
with
an
equally
desperate
fury
while
the
from
the
lower
floors
came
racing
to
hurl
themselves
into
the
fray
it
was
the
of
rabid
wolves
blind
panting
merciless
back
and
forth
it
surged
from
door
to
dais
blades
whickering
and
striking
into
flesh
blood
spurting
feet
stamping
the
crimson
floor
where
redder
pools
were
forming
ivory
tables
crashed
over
seats
were
splintered
velvet
hangings
torn
down
were
stained
red
it
was
the
bloody
climax
of
a
bloody
and
every
man
there
sensed
it
but
the
conclusion
was
inevitable
the
tecuhltli
outnumbered
the
invaders
almost
two
to
one
and
they
were
heartened
by
that
fact
and
by
the
entrance
into
the
mêlée
of
their
allies
these
crashed
into
the
fray
with
the
devastating
effect
of
a
hurricane
plowing
through
a
grove
of
saplings
in
sheer
strength
no
three
tlazitlans
were
a
match
for
conan
and
in
spite
of
his
weight
he
was
quicker
on
his
feet
than
any
of
them
he
moved
through
the
whirling
eddying
mass
with
the
surety
and
destructiveness
of
a
gray
wolf
amidst
a
pack
of
alley
curs
and
he
strode
over
a
wake
of
crumpled
figures
valeria
fought
beside
him
her
lips
smiling
and
her
eyes
blazing
she
was
stronger
than
the
average
man
and
far
quicker
and
more
ferocious
her
sword
was
like
a
living
thing
in
her
hand
where
conan
beat
down
opposition
by
the
sheer
weight
and
power
of
his
blows
breaking
spears
splitting
skulls
and
cleaving
bosoms
to
the
valeria
brought
into
action
a
finesse
of
that
dazzled
and
bewildered
her
antagonists
before
it
slew
them
again
and
again
a
warrior
heaving
high
his
heavy
blade
found
her
point
in
his
jugular
before
he
could
strike
conan
towering
above
the
field
strode
through
the
welter
smiting
right
and
left
but
valeria
moved
like
an
illusive
phantom
constantly
shifting
and
thrusting
and
slashing
as
she
shifted
swords
missed
her
again
and
again
as
the
wielders
flailed
the
empty
air
and
died
with
her
point
in
their
hearts
or
throats
and
her
mocking
laughter
in
their
ears
neither
sex
nor
condition
was
considered
by
the
maddened
combatants
the
five
women
of
the
xotalancas
were
down
with
their
throats
cut
before
conan
and
valeria
entered
the
fray
and
when
a
man
or
woman
went
down
under
the
stamping
feet
there
was
always
a
knife
ready
for
the
helpless
throat
or
a
sandaled
foot
eager
to
crush
the
prostrate
skull
from
wall
to
wall
from
door
to
door
rolled
the
waves
of
combat
spilling
over
into
adjoining
chambers
and
presently
only
tecuhltli
and
their
allies
stood
upright
in
the
great
throne
room
the
survivors
stared
bleakly
and
blankly
at
each
other
like
survivors
after
judgment
day
or
the
destruction
of
the
world
on
legs
hands
gripping
notched
and
dripping
swords
blood
trickling
down
their
arms
they
stared
at
one
another
across
the
mangled
corpses
of
friends
and
foes
they
had
no
breath
left
to
shout
but
a
bestial
mad
howling
rose
from
their
lips
it
was
not
a
human
cry
of
triumph
it
was
the
howling
of
a
rabid
stalking
among
the
bodies
of
its
victims
conan
caught
valeria
arm
and
turned
her
about
you
got
a
stab
in
the
calf
of
your
leg
he
growled
she
glanced
down
for
the
first
time
aware
of
a
stinging
in
the
muscles
of
her
leg
some
dying
man
on
the
floor
had
fleshed
his
dagger
with
his
last
effort
you
look
like
a
butcher
yourself
she
laughed
he
shook
a
red
shower
from
his
hands
not
mine
oh
a
scratch
here
and
there
nothing
to
bother
about
but
that
calf
ought
to
be
bandaged
olmec
came
through
the
litter
looking
like
a
ghoul
with
his
naked
massive
shoulders
splashed
with
blood
and
his
black
beard
dabbled
in
crimson
his
eyes
were
red
like
the
reflection
of
flame
on
black
water
we
have
won
he
croaked
dazedly
the
feud
is
ended
the
dogs
of
xotalanc
lie
dead
oh
for
a
captive
to
flay
alive
yet
it
is
good
to
look
upon
their
dead
faces
twenty
dead
dogs
twenty
red
nails
for
the
black
column
you
best
see
to
your
wounded
grunted
conan
turning
away
from
him
here
girl
let
me
see
that
leg
wait
a
minute
she
shook
him
off
impatiently
the
fire
of
fighting
still
burned
brightly
in
her
soul
how
do
we
know
these
are
all
of
them
these
might
have
come
on
a
raid
of
their
own
they
would
not
split
the
clan
on
a
foray
like
this
said
olmec
shaking
his
head
and
regaining
some
of
his
ordinary
intelligence
without
his
purple
robe
the
man
seemed
less
like
a
prince
than
some
repellent
beast
of
prey
i
will
stake
my
head
upon
it
that
we
have
slain
them
all
there
were
less
of
them
than
i
dreamed
and
they
must
have
been
desperate
but
how
came
they
in
tecuhltli
tascela
came
forward
wiping
her
sword
on
her
naked
thigh
and
holding
in
her
other
hand
an
object
she
had
taken
from
the
body
of
the
feathered
leader
of
the
xotalancas
the
pipes
of
madness
she
said
a
warrior
tells
me
that
xatmec
opened
the
door
to
the
xotalancas
and
was
cut
down
as
they
stormed
into
the
guardroom
this
warrior
came
to
the
guardroom
from
the
inner
hall
just
in
time
to
see
it
happen
and
to
hear
the
last
of
a
weird
strain
of
music
which
froze
his
very
soul
tolkemec
used
to
talk
of
these
pipes
which
the
xuchotlans
swore
were
hidden
somewhere
in
the
catacombs
with
the
bones
of
the
ancient
wizard
who
used
them
in
his
lifetime
somehow
the
dogs
of
xotalanc
found
them
and
learned
their
secret
somebody
ought
to
go
to
xotalanc
and
see
if
any
remain
alive
said
conan
i
go
if
somebody
will
guide
me
olmec
glanced
at
the
remnants
of
his
people
there
were
only
twenty
left
alive
and
of
these
several
lay
groaning
on
the
floor
tascela
was
the
only
one
of
the
tecuhltli
who
had
escaped
without
a
wound
the
princess
was
untouched
though
she
had
fought
as
savagely
as
any
who
will
go
with
conan
to
xotalanc
asked
olmec
techotl
limped
forward
the
wound
in
his
thigh
had
started
bleeding
afresh
and
he
had
another
gash
across
his
ribs
i
will
go
no
you
wo
vetoed
conan
and
you
not
going
either
valeria
in
a
little
while
that
leg
will
be
getting
stiff
i
will
go
volunteered
a
warrior
who
was
knotting
a
bandage
about
a
slashed
forearm
very
well
yanath
go
with
the
cimmerian
and
you
too
topal
olmec
indicated
another
man
whose
injuries
were
slight
but
first
aid
us
to
lift
the
badly
wounded
on
these
couches
where
we
may
bandage
their
hurts
this
was
done
quickly
as
they
stooped
to
pick
up
a
woman
who
had
been
stunned
by
a
olmec
beard
brushed
topal
ear
conan
thought
the
prince
muttered
something
to
the
warrior
but
he
could
not
be
sure
a
few
moments
later
he
was
leading
his
companions
down
the
hall
conan
glanced
back
as
he
went
out
the
door
at
that
shambles
where
the
dead
lay
on
the
smoldering
floor
dark
limbs
knotted
in
attitudes
of
fierce
muscular
effort
dark
faces
frozen
in
masks
of
hate
glassy
eyes
glaring
up
at
the
green
which
bathed
the
ghastly
scene
in
a
dusky
emerald
among
the
dead
the
living
moved
aimlessly
like
people
moving
in
a
trance
conan
heard
olmec
call
a
woman
and
direct
her
to
bandage
valeria
leg
the
pirate
followed
the
woman
into
an
adjoining
chamber
already
beginning
to
limp
slightly
warily
the
two
tecuhltli
led
conan
along
the
hall
beyond
the
bronze
door
and
through
chamber
after
chamber
shimmering
in
the
green
fire
they
saw
no
one
heard
no
sound
after
they
crossed
the
great
hall
which
bisected
the
city
from
north
to
south
their
caution
was
increased
by
the
realization
of
their
nearness
to
enemy
territory
but
chambers
and
halls
lay
empty
to
their
wary
gaze
and
they
came
at
last
along
a
broad
dim
hallway
and
halted
before
a
bronze
door
similar
to
the
eagle
door
of
tecuhltli
gingerly
they
tried
it
and
it
opened
silently
under
their
fingers
awed
they
stared
into
the
chambers
beyond
for
fifty
years
no
tecuhltli
had
entered
those
halls
save
as
a
prisoner
going
to
a
hideous
doom
to
go
to
xotalanc
had
been
the
ultimate
horror
that
could
befall
a
man
of
the
western
castle
the
terror
of
it
had
stalked
through
their
dreams
since
earliest
childhood
to
yanath
and
topal
that
bronze
door
was
like
the
portal
of
hell
they
cringed
back
unreasoning
horror
in
their
eyes
and
conan
pushed
past
them
and
strode
into
xotalanc
timidly
they
followed
him
as
each
man
set
foot
over
the
threshold
he
stared
and
glared
wildly
about
him
but
only
their
quick
hurried
breathing
disturbed
the
silence
they
had
come
into
a
square
guardroom
like
that
behind
the
eagle
door
of
tecuhltli
and
similarly
a
hall
ran
away
from
it
to
a
broad
chamber
that
was
a
counterpart
of
olmec
throne
room
conan
glanced
down
the
hall
with
its
rugs
and
divans
and
hangings
and
stood
listening
intently
he
heard
no
noise
and
the
rooms
had
an
empty
feel
he
did
not
believe
there
were
any
xotalancas
left
alive
in
xuchotl
come
on
he
muttered
and
started
down
the
hall
he
had
not
gone
far
when
he
was
aware
that
only
yanath
was
following
him
he
wheeled
back
to
see
topal
standing
in
an
attitude
of
horror
one
arm
out
as
if
to
fend
off
some
threatening
peril
his
distended
eyes
fixed
with
hypnotic
intensity
on
something
protruding
from
behind
a
divan
what
the
devil
then
conan
saw
what
topal
was
staring
at
and
he
felt
a
faint
twitching
of
the
skin
between
his
giant
shoulders
a
monstrous
head
protruded
from
behind
the
divan
a
reptilian
head
broad
as
the
head
of
a
crocodile
with
fangs
that
projected
over
the
lower
jaw
but
there
was
an
unnatural
limpness
about
the
thing
and
the
hideous
eyes
were
glazed
conan
peered
behind
the
couch
it
was
a
great
serpent
which
lay
there
limp
in
death
but
such
a
serpent
as
he
had
never
seen
in
his
wanderings
the
reek
and
chill
of
the
deep
black
earth
were
about
it
and
its
color
was
an
indeterminable
hue
which
changed
with
each
new
angle
from
which
he
surveyed
it
a
great
wound
in
the
neck
showed
what
had
caused
its
death
it
is
the
crawler
whispered
yanath
it
the
thing
i
slashed
on
the
stair
grunted
conan
after
it
trailed
us
to
the
eagle
door
it
dragged
itself
here
to
die
how
could
the
xotalancas
control
such
a
brute
the
tecuhltli
shivered
and
shook
their
heads
they
brought
it
up
from
the
black
tunnels
the
catacombs
they
discovered
secrets
unknown
to
tecuhltli
well
it
dead
and
if
they
had
any
more
of
them
they
have
brought
them
along
when
they
came
to
tecuhltli
come
on
they
crowded
close
at
his
heels
as
he
strode
down
the
hall
and
thrust
on
the
door
at
the
other
end
if
we
do
find
anybody
on
this
floor
he
said
we
descend
into
the
lower
floors
we
explore
xotalanc
from
the
roof
to
the
catacombs
if
xotalanc
is
like
tecuhltli
all
the
rooms
and
halls
in
this
tier
will
be
lighted
what
the
devil
they
had
come
into
the
broad
throne
chamber
so
similar
to
that
one
in
tecuhltli
there
were
the
same
jade
dais
and
ivory
seat
the
same
divans
rugs
and
hangings
on
the
walls
no
black
column
stood
behind
the
but
evidences
of
the
grim
feud
were
not
lacking
ranged
along
the
wall
behind
the
dais
were
rows
of
shelves
and
on
those
shelves
hundreds
of
human
heads
perfectly
preserved
stared
at
the
startled
watchers
with
emotionless
eyes
as
they
had
stared
for
only
the
gods
knew
how
many
months
and
years
topal
muttered
a
curse
but
yanath
stood
silent
the
mad
light
growing
in
his
wide
eyes
conan
frowned
knowing
that
tlazitlan
sanity
was
hung
on
a
suddenly
yanath
pointed
to
the
ghastly
relics
with
a
twitching
finger
there
is
my
brother
head
he
murmured
and
there
is
my
younger
brother
and
there
beyond
them
is
my
sister
eldest
son
suddenly
he
began
to
weep
with
harsh
loud
sobs
that
shook
his
frame
he
did
not
take
his
eyes
from
the
heads
his
sobs
grew
shriller
changed
to
frightful
laughter
and
that
in
turn
became
an
unbearable
screaming
yanath
was
stark
mad
conan
laid
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
as
if
the
touch
had
released
all
the
frenzy
in
his
soul
yanath
screamed
and
whirled
striking
at
the
cimmerian
with
his
sword
conan
parried
the
blow
and
topal
tried
to
catch
yanath
arm
but
the
madman
avoided
him
and
with
froth
flying
from
his
lips
he
drove
his
sword
deep
into
topal
body
topal
sank
down
with
a
groan
and
yanath
whirled
for
an
instant
like
a
crazy
dervish
then
he
ran
at
the
shelves
and
began
hacking
at
the
glass
with
his
sword
screeching
blasphemously
conan
sprang
at
him
from
behind
trying
to
catch
him
unaware
and
disarm
him
but
the
madman
wheeled
and
lunged
at
him
screaming
like
a
lost
soul
realizing
that
the
warrior
was
hopelessly
insane
the
cimmerian
and
as
the
maniac
went
past
he
swung
a
cut
that
severed
the
and
breast
and
dropped
the
man
dead
beside
his
dying
victim
conan
bent
over
topal
seeing
that
the
man
was
at
his
last
gasp
it
was
useless
to
seek
to
stanch
the
blood
gushing
from
the
horrible
wound
you
done
for
topal
grunted
conan
any
word
you
want
to
send
to
your
people
bend
closer
gasped
topal
and
conan
complied
and
an
instant
later
caught
the
man
wrist
as
topal
struck
at
his
breast
with
a
dagger
crom
swore
conan
are
you
mad
too
olmec
ordered
it
gasped
the
dying
man
i
know
not
why
as
we
lifted
the
wounded
upon
the
couches
he
whispered
to
me
bidding
me
to
slay
you
as
we
returned
to
tecuhltli
and
with
the
name
of
his
clan
on
his
lips
topal
died
conan
scowled
down
at
him
in
puzzlement
this
whole
affair
had
an
aspect
of
lunacy
was
olmec
mad
too
were
all
the
tecuhltli
madder
than
he
had
realized
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
he
strode
down
the
hall
and
out
of
the
bronze
door
leaving
the
dead
tecuhltli
lying
before
the
staring
dead
eyes
of
their
kinsmen
heads
conan
needed
no
guide
back
through
the
labyrinth
they
had
traversed
his
primitive
instinct
of
direction
led
him
unerringly
along
the
route
they
had
come
he
traversed
it
as
warily
as
he
had
before
his
sword
in
his
hand
and
his
eyes
fiercely
searching
each
shadowed
nook
and
corner
for
it
was
his
former
allies
he
feared
now
not
the
ghosts
of
the
slain
xotalancas
he
had
crossed
the
great
hall
and
entered
the
chambers
beyond
when
he
heard
something
moving
ahead
of
him
something
which
gasped
and
panted
and
moved
with
a
strange
floundering
scrambling
noise
a
moment
later
conan
saw
a
man
crawling
over
the
flaming
floor
toward
him
a
man
whose
progress
left
a
broad
bloody
smear
on
the
smoldering
surface
it
was
techotl
and
his
eyes
were
already
glazing
from
a
deep
gash
in
his
breast
blood
gushed
steadily
between
the
fingers
of
his
clutching
hand
with
the
other
he
clawed
and
hitched
himself
along
conan
he
cried
chokingly
conan
olmec
has
taken
the
woman
so
that
why
he
told
topal
to
kill
me
murmured
conan
dropping
to
his
knee
beside
the
man
who
his
experienced
eye
told
him
was
dying
olmec
is
so
mad
as
i
thought
techotl
groping
fingers
plucked
at
conan
arm
in
the
cold
loveless
and
altogether
hideous
life
of
the
tecuhltli
his
admiration
and
affection
for
the
invaders
from
the
outer
world
formed
a
warm
human
oasis
constituted
a
tie
that
connected
him
with
a
more
natural
humanity
that
was
totally
lacking
in
his
fellows
whose
only
emotions
were
hate
lust
and
the
urge
of
sadistic
cruelty
i
sought
to
oppose
him
gurgled
techotl
blood
bubbling
frothily
to
his
lips
but
he
struck
me
down
he
thought
he
had
slain
me
but
i
crawled
away
ah
set
how
far
i
have
crawled
in
my
own
blood
beware
conan
olmec
may
have
set
an
ambush
for
your
return
slay
olmec
he
is
a
beast
take
valeria
and
flee
fear
not
to
traverse
the
forest
olmec
and
tascela
lied
about
the
dragons
they
slew
each
other
years
ago
all
save
the
strongest
for
a
dozen
years
there
has
been
only
one
dragon
if
you
have
slain
him
there
is
naught
in
the
forest
to
harm
you
he
was
the
god
olmec
worshipped
and
olmec
fed
human
sacrifices
to
him
the
very
old
and
the
very
young
bound
and
hurled
from
the
wall
hasten
olmec
has
taken
valeria
to
the
chamber
of
the
his
head
slumped
down
and
he
was
dead
before
it
came
to
rest
on
the
floor
conan
sprang
up
his
eyes
like
live
coals
so
that
was
olmec
game
having
first
used
the
strangers
to
destroy
his
foes
he
should
have
known
that
something
of
the
sort
would
be
going
on
in
that
degenerate
mind
the
cimmerian
started
toward
tecuhltli
with
reckless
speed
rapidly
he
reckoned
the
numbers
of
his
former
allies
only
counting
olmec
had
survived
that
fiendish
battle
in
the
throne
room
three
had
died
since
which
left
seventeen
enemies
with
which
to
reckon
in
his
rage
conan
felt
capable
of
accounting
for
the
whole
clan
but
the
innate
craft
of
the
wilderness
rose
to
guide
his
berserk
rage
he
remembered
techotl
warning
of
an
ambush
it
was
quite
probable
that
the
prince
would
make
such
provisions
on
the
chance
that
topal
might
have
failed
to
carry
out
his
order
olmec
would
be
expecting
him
to
return
by
the
same
route
he
had
followed
in
going
to
xotalanc
conan
glanced
up
at
a
skylight
under
which
he
was
passing
and
caught
the
blurred
glimmer
of
stars
they
had
not
yet
begun
to
pale
for
dawn
the
events
of
the
night
had
been
crowded
into
a
comparatively
short
space
of
time
he
turned
aside
from
his
direct
course
and
descended
a
winding
staircase
to
the
floor
below
he
did
not
know
where
the
door
was
to
be
found
that
let
into
the
castle
on
that
level
but
he
knew
he
could
find
it
how
he
was
to
force
the
locks
he
did
not
know
he
believed
that
the
doors
of
tecuhltli
would
all
be
locked
and
bolted
if
for
no
other
reason
than
the
habits
of
half
a
century
but
there
was
nothing
else
but
to
attempt
it
sword
in
hand
he
hurried
noiselessly
on
through
a
maze
of
or
shadowy
rooms
and
halls
he
knew
he
must
be
near
tecuhltli
when
a
sound
brought
him
up
short
he
recognized
it
for
what
it
was
a
human
being
trying
to
cry
out
through
a
stifling
gag
it
came
from
somewhere
ahead
of
him
and
to
the
left
in
those
chambers
a
small
sound
carried
a
long
way
conan
turned
aside
and
went
seeking
after
the
sound
which
continued
to
be
repeated
presently
he
was
glaring
through
a
doorway
upon
a
weird
scene
in
the
room
into
which
he
was
looking
a
low
frame
of
iron
lay
on
the
floor
and
a
giant
figure
was
bound
prostrate
upon
it
his
head
rested
on
a
bed
of
iron
spikes
which
were
already
with
blood
where
they
had
pierced
his
scalp
a
peculiar
contrivance
was
fastened
about
his
head
though
in
such
a
manner
that
the
leather
band
did
not
protect
his
scalp
from
the
spikes
this
harness
was
connected
by
a
slender
chain
to
the
mechanism
that
upheld
a
huge
iron
ball
which
was
suspended
above
the
captive
hairy
breast
as
long
as
the
man
could
force
himself
to
remain
motionless
the
iron
ball
hung
in
its
place
but
when
the
pain
of
the
iron
points
caused
him
to
lift
his
head
the
ball
lurched
downward
a
few
inches
presently
his
aching
neck
muscles
would
no
longer
support
his
head
in
its
unnatural
position
and
it
would
fall
back
on
the
spikes
again
it
was
obvious
that
eventually
the
ball
would
crush
him
to
a
pulp
slowly
and
inexorably
the
victim
was
gagged
and
above
the
gag
his
great
black
rolled
wildly
toward
the
man
in
the
doorway
who
stood
in
silent
amazement
the
man
on
the
rack
was
olmec
prince
of
tecuhltli
the
eyes
of
why
did
you
bring
me
into
this
chamber
to
bandage
my
legs
demanded
valeria
could
you
have
done
it
just
as
well
in
the
throne
room
she
sat
on
a
couch
with
her
wounded
leg
extended
upon
it
and
the
tecuhltli
woman
had
just
bound
it
with
silk
bandages
sword
lay
on
the
couch
beside
her
she
frowned
as
she
spoke
the
woman
had
done
her
task
silently
and
efficiently
but
valeria
liked
neither
the
lingering
caressing
touch
of
her
slim
fingers
nor
the
expression
in
her
eyes
they
have
taken
the
rest
of
the
wounded
into
the
other
chambers
answered
the
woman
in
the
soft
speech
of
the
tecuhltli
women
which
somehow
did
not
suggest
either
softness
or
gentleness
in
the
speakers
a
little
while
before
valeria
had
seen
this
same
woman
stab
a
xotalanca
woman
through
the
breast
and
stamp
the
eyeballs
out
of
a
wounded
xotalanca
man
they
will
be
carrying
the
corpses
of
the
dead
down
into
the
catacombs
she
added
lest
the
ghosts
escape
into
the
chambers
and
dwell
there
do
you
believe
in
ghosts
asked
valeria
i
know
the
ghost
of
tolkemec
dwells
in
the
catacombs
she
answered
with
a
shiver
once
i
saw
it
as
i
crouched
in
a
crypt
among
the
bones
of
a
dead
queen
it
passed
by
in
the
form
of
an
ancient
man
with
flowing
white
beard
and
locks
and
luminous
eyes
that
blazed
in
the
darkness
it
was
tolkemec
i
saw
him
living
when
i
was
a
child
and
he
was
being
tortured
her
voice
sank
to
a
fearful
whisper
olmec
laughs
but
i
tolkemec
ghost
dwells
in
the
catacombs
they
say
it
is
rats
which
gnaw
the
flesh
from
the
bones
of
the
newly
dead
but
ghosts
eat
flesh
who
knows
but
that
she
glanced
up
quickly
as
a
shadow
fell
across
the
couch
valeria
looked
up
to
see
olmec
gazing
down
at
her
the
prince
had
cleansed
his
hands
torso
and
beard
of
the
blood
that
had
splashed
them
but
he
had
not
donned
his
robe
and
his
great
hairless
body
and
limbs
renewed
the
impression
of
strength
bestial
in
its
nature
his
deep
black
eyes
burned
with
a
more
elemental
light
and
there
was
the
suggestion
of
a
twitching
in
the
fingers
that
tugged
at
his
thick
beard
he
stared
fixedly
at
the
woman
and
she
rose
and
glided
from
the
chamber
as
she
passed
through
the
door
she
cast
a
look
over
her
shoulder
at
valeria
a
glance
full
of
cynical
derision
and
obscene
mockery
she
has
done
a
clumsy
job
criticized
the
prince
coming
to
the
divan
and
bending
over
the
bandage
let
me
see
with
a
quickness
amazing
in
one
of
his
bulk
he
snatched
her
sword
and
threw
it
across
the
chamber
his
next
move
was
to
catch
her
in
his
giant
arms
quick
and
unexpected
as
the
move
was
she
almost
matched
it
for
even
as
he
grabbed
her
her
dirk
was
in
her
hand
and
she
stabbed
murderously
at
his
throat
more
by
luck
than
skill
he
caught
her
wrist
and
then
began
a
savage
she
fought
him
with
fists
feet
knees
teeth
and
nails
with
all
the
strength
of
her
magnificent
body
and
all
the
knowledge
of
fighting
she
had
acquired
in
her
years
of
roving
and
fighting
on
sea
and
land
it
availed
her
nothing
against
his
brute
strength
she
lost
her
dirk
in
the
first
moment
of
contact
and
thereafter
found
herself
powerless
to
inflict
any
appreciable
pain
on
her
giant
attacker
the
blaze
in
his
weird
black
eyes
did
not
alter
and
their
expression
filled
her
with
fury
fanned
by
the
sardonic
smile
that
seemed
carved
upon
his
bearded
lips
those
eyes
and
that
smile
contained
all
the
cruel
cynicism
that
seethes
below
the
surface
of
a
sophisticated
and
degenerate
race
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
valeria
experienced
fear
of
a
man
it
was
like
struggling
against
some
huge
elemental
force
his
iron
arms
thwarted
her
efforts
with
an
ease
that
sent
panic
racing
through
her
limbs
he
seemed
impervious
to
any
pain
she
could
indict
only
once
when
she
sank
her
white
teeth
savagely
into
his
wrist
so
that
the
blood
started
did
he
react
and
that
was
to
buffet
her
brutally
upon
the
side
of
the
head
with
his
open
hand
so
that
stars
flashed
before
her
eyes
and
her
head
rolled
on
her
shoulders
her
shirt
had
been
torn
open
in
the
struggle
and
with
cynical
cruelty
he
rasped
his
thick
beard
across
her
bare
breasts
bringing
the
blood
to
suffuse
the
fair
skin
and
fetching
a
cry
of
pain
and
outraged
fury
from
her
her
convulsive
resistance
was
useless
she
was
crushed
down
on
a
couch
disarmed
and
panting
her
eyes
blazing
up
at
him
like
the
eyes
of
a
trapped
tigress
a
moment
later
he
was
hurrying
from
the
chamber
carrying
her
in
his
arms
she
made
no
resistance
but
the
smoldering
of
her
eyes
showed
that
she
was
unconquered
in
spirit
at
least
she
had
not
cried
out
she
knew
that
conan
was
not
within
call
and
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
any
in
tecuhltli
would
oppose
their
prince
but
she
noticed
that
olmec
went
stealthily
with
his
head
on
one
side
as
if
listening
for
sounds
of
pursuit
and
he
did
not
return
to
the
throne
chamber
he
carried
her
through
a
door
that
stood
opposite
that
through
which
he
had
entered
crossed
another
room
and
began
stealing
down
a
hall
as
she
became
convinced
that
he
feared
some
opposition
to
the
abduction
she
threw
back
her
head
and
screamed
at
the
top
of
her
lusty
voice
she
was
rewarded
by
a
slap
that
half
stunned
her
and
olmec
quickened
his
pace
to
a
shambling
run
but
her
cry
had
been
echoed
and
twisting
her
head
about
valeria
through
the
tears
and
stars
that
partly
blinded
her
saw
techotl
limping
after
them
olmec
turned
with
a
snarl
shifting
the
woman
to
an
uncomfortable
and
certainly
undignified
position
under
one
huge
arm
where
he
held
her
writhing
and
kicking
vainly
like
a
child
olmec
protested
techotl
you
can
not
be
such
a
dog
as
to
do
this
thing
she
is
conan
woman
she
helped
us
slay
the
xotalancas
and
without
a
word
olmec
balled
his
free
hand
into
a
huge
fist
and
stretched
the
wounded
warrior
senseless
at
his
feet
stooping
and
hindered
not
at
all
by
the
struggles
and
imprecations
of
his
captive
he
drew
sword
from
its
sheath
and
stabbed
the
warrior
in
the
breast
then
casting
aside
the
weapon
he
fled
on
along
the
corridor
he
did
not
see
a
woman
dark
face
peer
cautiously
after
him
from
behind
a
hanging
it
vanished
and
presently
techotl
groaned
and
stirred
rose
dazedly
and
staggered
drunkenly
away
calling
conan
name
olmec
hurried
on
down
the
corridor
and
descended
a
winding
ivory
staircase
he
crossed
several
corridors
and
halted
at
last
in
a
broad
chamber
whose
doors
were
veiled
with
heavy
tapestries
with
one
exception
a
heavy
bronze
door
similar
to
the
door
of
the
eagle
on
the
upper
floor
he
was
moved
to
rumble
pointing
to
it
that
is
one
of
the
outer
doors
of
tecuhltli
for
the
first
time
in
fifty
years
it
is
unguarded
we
need
not
guard
it
now
for
xotalanc
is
no
more
thanks
to
conan
and
me
you
bloody
rogue
sneered
valeria
trembling
with
fury
and
the
shame
of
physical
coercion
you
treacherous
dog
conan
will
cut
your
throat
for
this
olmec
did
not
bother
to
voice
his
belief
that
conan
own
gullet
had
already
been
severed
according
to
his
whispered
command
he
was
too
utterly
cynical
to
be
at
all
interested
in
her
thoughts
or
opinions
his
eyes
devoured
her
dwelling
burningly
on
the
generous
expanses
of
clear
white
flesh
exposed
where
her
shirt
and
breeches
had
been
torn
in
the
struggle
forget
conan
he
said
thickly
olmec
is
lord
of
xuchotl
xotalanc
is
no
more
there
will
be
no
more
fighting
we
shall
spend
our
lives
in
drinking
and
first
let
us
drink
he
seated
himself
on
an
ivory
table
and
pulled
her
down
on
his
knees
like
a
satyr
with
a
white
nymph
in
his
arms
ignoring
her
profanity
he
held
her
helpless
with
one
great
arm
about
her
waist
while
the
other
reached
across
the
table
and
secured
a
vessel
of
wine
drink
he
commanded
forcing
it
to
her
lips
as
she
writhed
her
head
away
the
liquor
slopped
over
stinging
her
lips
splashing
down
on
her
naked
breasts
your
guest
does
not
like
your
wine
olmec
spoke
a
cool
sardonic
voice
olmec
stiffened
fear
grew
in
his
flaming
eyes
slowly
he
swung
his
great
head
about
and
stared
at
tascela
who
posed
negligently
in
the
curtained
doorway
one
hand
on
her
smooth
hip
valeria
twisted
herself
about
in
his
iron
grip
and
when
she
met
the
burning
eyes
of
tascela
a
chill
tingled
along
her
supple
spine
new
experiences
were
flooding
valeria
proud
soul
that
night
recently
she
had
learned
to
fear
a
man
now
she
knew
what
it
was
to
fear
a
woman
olmec
sat
motionless
a
gray
pallor
growing
under
his
swarthy
skin
tascela
brought
her
other
hand
from
behind
her
and
displayed
a
small
gold
vessel
i
feared
she
would
not
like
your
wine
olmec
purred
the
princess
so
i
brought
some
of
mine
some
i
brought
with
me
long
ago
from
the
shores
of
lake
zuad
do
you
understand
olmec
beads
of
sweat
stood
out
suddenly
on
olmec
brow
his
muscles
relaxed
and
valeria
broke
away
and
put
the
table
between
them
but
though
reason
told
her
to
dart
from
the
room
some
fascination
she
could
not
understand
held
her
rigid
watching
the
scene
tascela
came
toward
the
seated
prince
with
a
swaying
undulating
walk
that
was
mockery
in
itself
her
voice
was
soft
slurringly
caressing
but
her
eyes
gleamed
her
slim
fingers
stroked
his
beard
lightly
you
are
selfish
olmec
she
crooned
smiling
you
would
keep
our
handsome
guest
to
yourself
though
you
knew
i
wished
to
entertain
her
you
are
much
at
fault
olmec
the
mask
dropped
for
an
instant
her
eyes
flashed
her
face
was
contorted
and
with
an
appalling
show
of
strength
her
hand
locked
convulsively
in
his
beard
and
tore
out
a
great
handful
this
evidence
of
unnatural
strength
was
no
more
terrifying
than
the
momentary
baring
of
the
hellish
fury
that
raged
under
her
bland
exterior
olmec
lurched
up
with
a
roar
and
stood
swaying
like
a
bear
his
mighty
hands
clenching
and
unclenching
slut
his
booming
voice
filled
the
room
witch
tecuhltli
should
have
slain
you
fifty
years
ago
begone
i
have
endured
too
much
from
you
this
wench
is
mine
get
hence
before
i
slay
you
the
princess
laughed
and
dashed
the
strands
into
his
face
her
laughter
was
less
merciful
than
the
ring
of
flint
on
steel
once
you
spoke
otherwise
olmec
she
taunted
once
in
your
youth
you
spoke
words
of
love
aye
you
were
my
lover
once
years
ago
and
because
you
loved
me
you
slept
in
my
arms
beneath
the
enchanted
lotus
and
thereby
put
into
my
hands
the
chains
that
enslaved
you
you
know
you
can
not
withstand
me
you
know
i
have
but
to
gaze
into
your
eyes
with
the
mystic
power
a
priest
of
stygia
taught
me
long
ago
and
you
are
powerless
you
remember
the
night
beneath
the
black
lotus
that
waved
above
us
stirred
by
no
worldly
breeze
you
scent
again
the
unearthly
perfumes
that
stole
and
rose
like
a
cloud
about
you
to
enslave
you
you
can
not
fight
against
me
you
are
my
slave
as
you
were
that
night
as
you
shall
be
so
long
as
you
shall
live
olmec
of
xuchotl
her
voice
had
sunk
to
a
murmur
like
the
rippling
of
a
stream
running
through
starlit
darkness
she
leaned
close
to
the
prince
and
spread
her
long
tapering
fingers
upon
his
giant
breast
his
eyes
glazed
his
great
hands
fell
limply
to
his
sides
with
a
smile
of
cruel
malice
tascela
lifted
the
vessel
and
placed
it
to
his
lips
drink
mechanically
the
prince
obeyed
and
instantly
the
glaze
passed
from
his
eyes
and
they
were
flooded
with
fury
comprehension
and
an
awful
fear
his
mouth
gaped
but
no
sound
issued
for
an
instant
he
reeled
on
buckling
knees
and
then
fell
in
a
sodden
heap
on
the
floor
his
fall
jolted
valeria
out
of
her
paralysis
she
turned
and
sprang
toward
the
door
but
with
a
movement
that
would
have
shamed
a
leaping
panther
tascela
was
before
her
valeria
struck
at
her
with
her
clenched
fist
and
all
the
power
of
her
supple
body
behind
the
blow
it
would
have
stretched
a
man
senseless
on
the
floor
but
with
a
lithe
twist
of
her
torso
tascela
avoided
the
blow
and
caught
the
pirate
wrist
the
next
instant
valeria
left
hand
was
imprisoned
and
holding
her
wrists
together
with
one
hand
tascela
calmly
bound
them
with
a
cord
she
drew
from
her
girdle
valeria
thought
she
had
tasted
the
ultimate
in
humiliation
already
that
night
but
her
shame
at
being
manhandled
by
olmec
was
nothing
to
the
sensations
that
now
shook
her
supple
frame
valeria
had
always
been
inclined
to
despise
the
other
members
of
her
sex
and
it
was
overwhelming
to
encounter
another
woman
who
could
handle
her
like
a
child
she
scarcely
resisted
at
all
when
tascela
forced
her
into
a
chair
and
drawing
her
bound
wrists
down
between
her
knees
fastened
them
to
the
chair
casually
stepping
over
olmec
tascela
walked
to
the
bronze
door
and
shot
the
bolt
and
threw
it
open
revealing
a
hallway
without
opening
upon
this
hall
she
remarked
speaking
to
her
feminine
captive
for
the
first
time
there
is
a
chamber
which
in
old
times
was
used
as
a
torture
room
when
we
retired
into
tecuhltli
we
brought
most
of
the
apparatus
with
us
but
there
was
one
piece
too
heavy
to
move
it
is
still
in
working
order
i
think
it
will
be
quite
convenient
now
an
understanding
flame
of
terror
rose
in
olmec
eyes
tascela
strode
back
to
him
bent
and
gripped
him
by
the
hair
he
is
only
paralyzed
temporarily
she
remarked
conversationally
he
can
hear
think
and
feel
aye
he
can
feel
very
well
indeed
with
which
sinister
observation
she
started
toward
the
door
dragging
the
giant
bulk
with
an
ease
that
made
the
pirate
eyes
dilate
she
passed
into
the
hall
and
moved
down
it
without
hesitation
presently
disappearing
with
her
captive
into
a
chamber
that
opened
into
it
and
whence
shortly
thereafter
issued
the
clank
of
iron
valeria
swore
softly
and
tugged
vainly
with
her
legs
braced
against
the
chair
the
cords
that
confined
her
were
apparently
unbreakable
tascela
presently
returned
alone
behind
her
a
muffled
groaning
issued
from
the
chamber
she
closed
the
door
but
did
not
bolt
it
tascela
was
beyond
the
grip
of
habit
as
she
was
beyond
the
touch
of
other
human
instincts
and
emotions
valeria
sat
dumbly
watching
the
woman
in
whose
slim
hands
the
pirate
realized
her
destiny
now
rested
tascela
grasped
her
yellow
locks
and
forced
back
her
head
looking
impersonally
down
into
her
face
but
the
glitter
in
her
dark
eyes
was
not
impersonal
i
have
chosen
you
for
a
great
honor
she
said
you
shall
restore
the
youth
of
tascela
oh
you
stare
at
that
my
appearance
is
that
of
youth
but
through
my
veins
creeps
the
sluggish
chill
of
approaching
age
as
i
have
felt
it
a
thousand
times
before
i
am
old
so
old
i
do
not
remember
my
childhood
but
i
was
a
girl
once
and
a
priest
of
stygia
loved
me
and
gave
me
the
secret
of
immortality
and
youth
everlasting
he
died
then
some
said
by
poison
but
i
dwelt
in
my
palace
by
the
shores
of
lake
zuad
and
the
passing
years
touched
me
not
so
at
last
a
king
of
stygia
desired
me
and
my
people
rebelled
and
brought
me
to
this
land
olmec
called
me
a
princess
i
am
not
of
royal
blood
i
am
greater
than
a
princess
i
am
tascela
whose
youth
your
own
glorious
youth
shall
restore
valeria
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of
her
mouth
she
sensed
here
a
mystery
darker
than
the
degeneracy
she
had
anticipated
the
taller
woman
unbound
the
aquilonian
wrists
and
pulled
her
to
her
feet
it
was
not
fear
of
the
dominant
strength
that
lurked
in
the
princess
limbs
that
made
valeria
a
helpless
quivering
captive
in
her
hands
it
was
the
burning
hypnotic
terrible
eyes
of
tascela
he
comes
from
the
well
i
a
kushite
conan
glared
down
at
the
man
on
the
iron
rack
what
the
devil
are
doing
on
that
thing
incoherent
sounds
issued
from
behind
the
gag
and
conan
bent
and
tore
it
away
evoking
a
bellow
of
fear
from
the
captive
for
his
action
caused
the
iron
ball
to
lurch
down
until
it
nearly
touched
the
broad
breast
be
careful
for
set
sake
begged
olmec
what
for
demanded
conan
do
you
think
i
care
what
happens
to
you
i
only
wish
i
had
time
to
stay
here
and
watch
that
chunk
of
iron
grind
your
guts
out
but
i
in
a
hurry
where
valeria
loose
me
urged
olmec
i
will
tell
you
all
tell
me
first
never
the
prince
heavy
jaws
set
stubbornly
all
right
conan
seated
himself
on
a
bench
i
find
her
myself
after
you
been
reduced
to
a
jelly
i
believe
i
can
speed
up
that
process
by
twisting
my
around
in
your
ear
he
added
extending
the
weapon
experimentally
wait
words
came
in
a
rush
from
the
captive
ashy
lips
tascela
took
her
from
me
i
never
been
anything
but
a
puppet
in
tascela
hands
tascela
snorted
conan
and
spat
why
the
filthy
no
no
panted
olmec
it
worse
than
you
think
tascela
is
old
centuries
old
she
renews
her
life
and
her
youth
by
the
sacrifice
of
beautiful
young
women
that
one
thing
that
has
reduced
the
clan
to
its
present
state
she
will
draw
the
essence
of
valeria
life
into
her
own
body
and
bloom
with
fresh
vigor
and
beauty
are
the
doors
locked
asked
conan
thumbing
his
sword
edge
aye
but
i
know
a
way
to
get
into
tecuhltli
only
tascela
and
i
know
and
she
thinks
me
helpless
and
you
slain
free
me
and
i
swear
i
will
help
you
rescue
valeria
without
my
help
you
can
not
win
into
tecuhltli
for
even
if
you
tortured
me
into
revealing
the
secret
you
could
work
it
let
me
go
and
we
will
steal
on
tascela
and
kill
her
before
she
can
work
magic
before
she
can
fix
her
eyes
on
us
a
knife
thrown
from
behind
will
do
the
work
i
should
have
killed
her
thus
long
ago
but
i
feared
that
without
her
to
aid
us
the
xotalancas
would
overcome
us
she
needed
my
help
too
that
the
only
reason
she
let
me
live
this
long
now
neither
needs
the
other
and
one
must
die
i
swear
that
when
we
have
slain
the
witch
you
and
valeria
shall
go
free
without
harm
my
people
will
obey
me
when
tascela
is
dead
conan
stooped
and
cut
the
ropes
that
held
the
prince
and
olmec
slid
cautiously
from
under
the
great
ball
and
rose
shaking
his
head
like
a
bull
and
muttering
imprecations
as
he
fingered
his
lacerated
scalp
standing
shoulder
to
shoulder
the
two
men
presented
a
formidable
picture
of
primitive
power
olmec
was
as
tall
as
conan
and
heavier
but
there
was
something
repellent
about
the
tlazitlan
something
abysmal
and
monstrous
that
contrasted
unfavorably
with
the
compact
hardness
of
the
cimmerian
conan
had
discarded
the
remnants
of
his
tattered
shirt
and
stood
with
his
remarkable
muscular
development
impressively
revealed
his
great
shoulders
were
as
broad
as
those
of
olmec
and
more
cleanly
outlined
and
his
huge
breast
arched
with
a
more
impressive
sweep
to
a
hard
waist
that
lacked
the
paunchy
thickness
of
olmec
midsection
he
might
have
been
an
image
of
primal
strength
cut
out
of
bronze
olmec
was
darker
but
not
from
the
burning
of
the
sun
if
conan
was
a
figure
out
of
the
dawn
of
time
olmec
was
a
shambling
somber
shape
from
the
darkness
of
time
lead
on
demanded
conan
and
keep
ahead
of
me
i
do
trust
you
any
farther
than
i
can
throw
a
bull
by
the
tail
olmec
turned
and
stalked
on
ahead
of
him
one
hand
twitching
slightly
as
it
plucked
at
his
matted
beard
olmec
did
not
lead
conan
back
to
the
bronze
door
which
the
prince
naturally
supposed
tascela
had
locked
but
to
a
certain
chamber
on
the
border
of
tecuhltli
this
secret
has
been
guarded
for
half
a
century
he
said
not
even
our
own
clan
knew
of
it
and
the
xotalancas
never
learned
tecuhltli
himself
built
this
secret
entrance
afterward
slaying
the
slaves
who
did
the
work
for
he
feared
that
he
might
find
himself
locked
out
of
his
own
kingdom
some
day
because
of
the
spite
of
tascela
whose
passion
for
him
soon
changed
to
hate
but
she
discovered
the
secret
and
barred
the
hidden
door
against
him
one
day
as
he
fled
back
from
an
unsuccessful
raid
and
the
xotalancas
took
him
and
flayed
him
but
once
spying
upon
her
i
saw
her
enter
tecuhltli
by
this
route
and
so
learned
the
secret
he
pressed
upon
a
gold
ornament
in
the
wall
and
a
panel
swung
inward
disclosing
an
ivory
stair
leading
upward
this
stair
is
built
within
the
wall
said
olmec
it
leads
up
to
a
tower
upon
the
roof
and
thence
other
stairs
wind
down
to
the
various
chambers
hasten
after
you
comrade
retorted
conan
satirically
swaying
his
broadsword
as
he
spoke
and
olmec
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
stepped
onto
the
staircase
conan
instantly
followed
him
and
the
door
shut
behind
them
far
above
a
cluster
of
made
the
staircase
a
well
of
dusky
they
mounted
until
conan
estimated
that
they
were
above
the
level
of
the
fourth
floor
and
then
came
out
into
a
cylindrical
tower
in
the
domed
roof
of
which
was
set
the
bunch
of
that
lighted
the
stair
through
windows
set
with
unbreakable
crystal
panes
the
first
windows
he
had
seen
in
xuchotl
conan
got
a
glimpse
of
high
ridges
domes
and
more
towers
looming
darkly
against
the
stars
he
was
looking
across
the
roofs
of
xuchotl
olmec
did
not
look
through
the
windows
he
hurried
down
one
of
the
several
stairs
that
wound
down
from
the
tower
and
when
they
had
descended
a
few
feet
this
stair
changed
into
a
narrow
corridor
that
wound
tortuously
on
for
some
distance
it
ceased
at
a
steep
flight
of
steps
leading
downward
there
olmec
paused
up
from
below
muffled
but
unmistakable
welled
a
woman
scream
edged
with
fright
fury
and
shame
and
conan
recognized
valeria
voice
in
the
swift
rage
roused
by
that
cry
and
the
amazement
of
wondering
what
peril
could
wring
such
a
shriek
from
valeria
reckless
lips
conan
forgot
olmec
he
pushed
past
the
prince
and
started
down
the
stair
awakening
instinct
brought
him
about
again
just
as
olmec
struck
with
his
great
fist
the
blow
fierce
and
silent
was
aimed
at
the
base
of
conan
brain
but
the
cimmerian
wheeled
in
time
to
receive
the
buffet
on
the
side
of
his
neck
instead
the
impact
would
have
snapped
the
vertebræ
of
a
lesser
man
as
it
was
conan
swayed
backward
but
even
as
he
reeled
he
dropped
his
sword
useless
at
such
close
quarters
and
grasped
olmec
extended
arm
dragging
the
prince
with
him
as
he
fell
headlong
they
went
down
the
steps
together
in
a
revolving
whirl
of
limbs
and
heads
and
bodies
and
as
they
went
conan
iron
fingers
found
and
locked
in
olmec
the
barbarian
neck
and
shoulder
felt
numb
from
the
impact
of
olmec
huge
fist
which
had
carried
all
the
strength
of
the
massive
forearm
thick
triceps
and
great
shoulder
but
this
did
not
affect
his
ferocity
to
any
appreciable
extent
like
a
bulldog
he
hung
on
grimly
shaken
and
battered
and
beaten
against
the
steps
as
they
rolled
until
at
last
they
struck
an
ivory
at
the
bottom
with
such
an
impact
that
they
splintered
it
down
its
full
length
and
crashed
through
its
ruins
but
olmec
was
already
dead
for
those
iron
fingers
had
crushed
out
his
life
and
broken
his
neck
as
they
fell
conan
rose
shaking
the
splinters
from
his
great
shoulder
blinking
blood
and
dust
out
of
his
eyes
he
was
in
the
great
throne
room
there
were
fifteen
people
in
that
room
besides
himself
the
first
person
he
saw
was
valeria
a
curious
black
altar
stood
before
the
ranged
about
it
seven
black
candles
in
golden
candlesticks
sent
up
oozing
spirals
of
thick
green
smoke
disturbingly
scented
these
spirals
united
in
a
cloud
near
the
ceiling
forming
a
smoky
arch
above
the
altar
on
that
altar
lay
valeria
stark
naked
her
white
flesh
gleaming
in
shocking
contrast
to
the
glistening
ebon
stone
she
was
not
bound
she
lay
at
full
length
her
arms
stretched
out
above
her
head
to
their
fullest
extent
at
the
head
of
the
altar
knelt
a
young
man
holding
her
wrists
firmly
a
young
woman
knelt
at
the
other
end
of
the
altar
grasping
her
ankles
between
them
she
could
neither
rise
nor
move
eleven
men
and
women
of
tecuhltli
knelt
dumbly
in
a
semicircle
watching
the
scene
with
hot
lustful
eyes
on
the
ivory
tascela
lolled
bronze
bowls
of
incense
rolled
their
spirals
about
her
the
wisps
of
smoke
curled
about
her
naked
limbs
like
caressing
fingers
she
could
not
sit
still
she
squirmed
and
shifted
about
with
sensuous
abandon
as
if
finding
pleasure
in
the
contact
of
the
smooth
ivory
with
her
sleek
flesh
the
crash
of
the
door
as
it
broke
beneath
the
impact
of
the
hurtling
bodies
caused
no
change
in
the
scene
the
kneeling
men
and
women
merely
glanced
incuriously
at
the
corpse
of
their
prince
and
at
the
man
who
rose
from
the
ruins
of
the
door
then
swung
their
eyes
greedily
back
to
the
writhing
white
shape
on
the
black
altar
tascela
looked
insolently
at
him
and
sprawled
back
on
her
seat
laughing
mockingly
slut
conan
saw
red
his
hands
clenched
into
iron
hammers
as
he
started
for
her
with
his
first
step
something
clanged
loudly
and
steel
bit
savagely
into
his
leg
he
stumbled
and
almost
fell
checked
in
his
headlong
stride
the
jaws
of
an
iron
trap
had
closed
on
his
leg
with
teeth
that
sank
deep
and
held
only
the
ridged
muscles
of
his
calf
saved
the
bone
from
being
splintered
the
accursed
thing
had
sprung
out
of
the
smoldering
floor
without
warning
he
saw
the
slots
now
in
the
floor
where
the
jaws
had
lain
perfectly
camouflaged
fool
laughed
tascela
did
you
think
i
would
not
guard
against
your
possible
return
every
door
in
this
chamber
is
guarded
by
such
traps
stand
there
and
watch
now
while
i
fulfill
the
destiny
of
your
handsome
friend
then
i
will
decide
your
own
conan
hand
instinctively
sought
his
belt
only
to
encounter
an
empty
scabbard
his
sword
was
on
the
stair
behind
him
his
poniard
was
lying
back
in
the
forest
where
the
dragon
had
torn
it
from
his
jaw
the
steel
teeth
in
his
leg
were
like
burning
coals
but
the
pain
was
not
as
savage
as
the
fury
that
seethed
in
his
soul
he
was
trapped
like
a
wolf
if
he
had
had
his
sword
he
would
have
hewn
off
his
leg
and
crawled
across
the
floor
to
slay
tascela
valeria
eyes
rolled
toward
him
with
mute
appeal
and
his
own
helplessness
sent
red
waves
of
madness
surging
through
his
brain
dropping
on
the
knee
of
his
free
leg
he
strove
to
get
his
fingers
between
the
jaws
of
the
trap
to
tear
them
apart
by
sheer
strength
blood
started
from
beneath
his
finger
nails
but
the
jaws
fitted
close
about
his
leg
in
a
circle
whose
segments
jointed
perfectly
contracted
until
there
was
no
space
between
his
mangled
flesh
and
the
fanged
iron
the
sight
of
valeria
naked
body
added
flame
to
the
fire
of
his
rage
tascela
ignored
him
rising
languidly
from
her
seat
she
swept
the
ranks
of
her
subjects
with
a
searching
glance
and
asked
where
are
xamec
zlanath
and
tachic
they
did
not
return
from
the
catacombs
princess
answered
a
man
like
the
rest
of
us
they
bore
the
bodies
of
the
slain
into
the
crypts
but
they
have
not
returned
perhaps
the
ghost
of
tolkemec
took
them
be
silent
fool
she
ordered
harshly
the
ghost
is
a
myth
she
came
down
from
her
dais
playing
with
a
thin
dagger
her
eyes
burned
like
nothing
on
the
hither
side
of
hell
she
paused
beside
the
altar
and
spoke
in
the
tense
stillness
your
life
shall
make
me
young
white
woman
she
said
i
shall
lean
upon
your
bosom
and
place
my
lips
over
yours
and
slowly
ah
slowly
sink
this
blade
through
your
heart
so
that
your
life
fleeing
your
stiffening
body
shall
enter
mine
making
me
bloom
again
with
youth
and
with
life
everlasting
slowly
like
a
serpent
arching
toward
its
victim
she
bent
down
through
the
writhing
smoke
closer
and
closer
over
the
now
motionless
woman
who
stared
up
into
her
glowing
dark
eyes
eyes
that
grew
larger
and
deeper
blazing
like
black
moons
in
the
swirling
smoke
the
kneeling
people
gripped
their
hands
and
held
their
breath
tense
for
the
bloody
climax
and
the
only
sound
was
conan
fierce
panting
as
he
strove
to
tear
his
leg
from
the
trap
all
eyes
were
glued
on
the
altar
and
the
white
figure
there
the
crash
of
a
thunderbolt
could
hardly
have
broken
the
spell
yet
it
was
only
a
low
cry
that
shattered
the
fixity
of
the
scene
and
brought
all
whirling
about
a
low
cry
yet
one
to
make
the
hair
stand
up
stiffly
on
the
scalp
they
looked
and
they
saw
framed
in
the
door
to
the
left
of
the
dais
stood
a
nightmare
figure
it
was
a
man
with
a
tangle
of
white
hair
and
a
matted
white
beard
that
fell
over
his
breast
rags
only
partly
covered
his
gaunt
frame
revealing
limbs
strangely
unnatural
in
appearance
the
skin
was
not
like
that
of
a
normal
human
there
was
a
suggestion
of
about
it
as
if
the
owner
had
dwelt
long
under
conditions
almost
antithetical
to
those
conditions
under
which
human
life
ordinarily
thrives
and
there
was
nothing
at
all
human
about
the
eyes
that
blazed
from
the
tangle
of
white
hair
they
were
great
gleaming
disks
that
stared
unwinkingly
luminous
whitish
and
without
a
hint
of
normal
emotion
or
sanity
the
mouth
gaped
but
no
coherent
words
issued
only
a
tittering
tolkemec
whispered
tascela
livid
while
the
others
crouched
in
speechless
horror
no
myth
then
no
ghost
set
you
have
dwelt
for
twelve
years
in
darkness
twelve
years
among
the
bones
of
the
dead
what
grisly
food
did
you
find
what
mad
travesty
of
life
did
you
live
in
the
stark
blackness
of
that
eternal
night
i
see
now
why
xamec
and
zlanath
and
tachic
did
not
return
from
the
catacombs
and
never
will
return
but
why
have
you
waited
so
long
to
strike
were
you
seeking
something
in
the
pits
some
secret
weapon
you
knew
was
hidden
there
and
have
you
found
it
at
last
that
hideous
tittering
was
tolkemec
only
reply
as
he
bounded
into
the
room
with
a
long
leap
that
carried
him
over
the
secret
trap
before
the
door
by
chance
or
by
some
faint
recollection
of
the
ways
of
xuchotl
he
was
not
mad
as
a
man
is
mad
he
had
dwelt
apart
from
humanity
so
long
that
he
was
no
longer
human
only
an
unbroken
thread
of
memory
embodied
in
hate
and
the
urge
for
vengeance
had
connected
him
with
the
humanity
from
which
he
had
been
cut
off
and
held
him
lurking
near
the
people
he
hated
only
that
thin
string
had
kept
him
from
racing
and
prancing
off
for
ever
into
the
black
corridors
and
realms
of
the
subterranean
world
he
had
discovered
long
ago
you
sought
something
hidden
whispered
tascela
cringing
back
and
you
have
found
it
you
remember
the
feud
after
all
these
years
of
blackness
you
remember
for
in
the
lean
hand
of
tolkemec
now
waved
a
curious
wand
on
the
end
of
which
glowed
a
knob
of
crimson
shaped
like
a
pomegranate
she
sprang
aside
as
he
thrust
it
out
like
a
spear
and
a
beam
of
crimson
fire
lanced
from
the
pomegranate
it
missed
tascela
but
the
woman
holding
valeria
ankles
was
in
the
way
it
smote
between
her
shoulders
there
was
a
sharp
crackling
sound
and
the
ray
of
fire
flashed
from
her
bosom
and
struck
the
black
altar
with
a
snapping
of
blue
sparks
the
woman
toppled
sidewise
shriveling
and
withering
like
a
mummy
even
as
she
fell
valeria
rolled
from
the
altar
on
the
other
side
and
started
for
the
opposite
wall
on
all
fours
for
hell
had
burst
loose
in
the
throne
room
of
dead
olmec
the
man
who
had
held
valeria
hands
was
the
next
to
die
he
turned
to
run
but
before
he
had
taken
half
a
dozen
steps
tolkemec
with
an
agility
appalling
in
such
a
frame
bounded
around
to
a
position
that
placed
the
man
between
him
and
the
altar
again
the
red
flashed
and
the
tecuhltli
rolled
lifeless
to
the
floor
as
the
beam
completed
its
course
with
a
burst
of
blue
sparks
against
the
altar
then
began
slaughter
screaming
insanely
the
people
rushed
about
the
chamber
caroming
from
one
another
stumbling
and
falling
and
among
them
tolkemec
capered
and
pranced
dealing
death
they
could
not
escape
by
the
doors
for
apparently
the
metal
of
the
portals
served
like
the
stone
altar
to
complete
the
circuit
for
whatever
hellish
power
flashed
like
thunderbolts
from
the
the
ancient
waved
in
his
hand
when
he
caught
a
man
or
a
woman
between
him
and
a
door
or
the
altar
that
one
died
instantly
he
chose
no
special
victim
he
took
them
as
they
came
with
his
rags
flapping
about
his
wildly
gyrating
limbs
and
the
gusty
echoes
of
his
tittering
sweeping
the
room
above
the
screams
and
bodies
fell
like
falling
leaves
about
the
altar
and
at
the
doors
one
warrior
in
desperation
rushed
at
him
lifting
a
dagger
only
to
fall
before
he
could
strike
but
the
rest
were
like
crazed
cattle
with
no
thought
for
resistance
and
no
chance
of
escape
the
last
tecuhltli
except
tascela
had
fallen
when
the
princess
reached
the
cimmerian
and
the
girl
who
had
taken
refuge
beside
him
tascela
bent
and
touched
the
floor
pressing
a
design
upon
it
instantly
the
iron
jaws
released
the
bleeding
limb
and
sank
back
into
the
floor
slay
him
if
you
can
she
panted
and
pressed
a
heavy
knife
into
his
hand
i
have
no
magic
to
withstand
him
with
a
grunt
he
sprang
before
the
women
not
heeding
his
lacerated
leg
in
the
heat
of
the
tolkemec
was
coming
toward
him
his
weird
eyes
ablaze
but
he
hesitated
at
the
gleam
of
the
knife
in
hand
then
began
a
grim
game
as
tolkemec
sought
to
circle
about
conan
and
get
the
barbarian
between
him
and
the
altar
or
a
metal
door
while
conan
sought
to
avoid
this
and
drive
home
his
knife
the
women
watched
tensely
holding
their
breath
there
was
no
sound
except
the
rustle
and
scrape
of
feet
tolkemec
pranced
and
capered
no
more
he
realized
that
grimmer
game
confronted
him
than
the
people
who
had
died
screaming
and
fleeing
in
the
elemental
blaze
of
the
barbarian
eyes
he
read
an
intent
deadly
as
his
own
back
and
forth
they
weaved
and
when
one
moved
the
other
moved
as
if
invisible
threads
bound
them
together
but
all
the
time
conan
was
getting
closer
and
closer
to
his
enemy
already
the
coiled
muscles
of
his
thighs
were
beginning
to
flex
for
a
spring
when
valeria
cried
out
for
a
fleeting
instant
a
bronze
door
was
in
line
with
conan
moving
body
the
red
line
leaped
searing
conan
flank
as
he
twisted
aside
and
even
as
he
shifted
he
hurled
the
knife
old
tolkemec
went
down
truly
slain
at
last
the
hilt
vibrating
on
his
breast
tascela
sprang
not
toward
conan
but
toward
the
wand
where
it
shimmered
like
a
live
thing
on
the
floor
but
as
she
leaped
so
did
valeria
with
a
dagger
snatched
from
a
dead
man
and
the
blade
driven
with
all
the
power
of
the
pirate
muscles
impaled
the
princess
of
tecuhltli
so
that
the
point
stood
out
between
her
breasts
tascela
screamed
once
and
fell
dead
and
valeria
spurned
the
body
with
her
heel
as
it
fell
i
had
to
do
that
much
for
my
own
panted
valeria
facing
conan
across
the
limp
corpse
well
this
cleans
up
the
feud
he
grunted
it
been
a
hell
of
a
night
where
did
these
people
keep
their
food
i
hungry
you
need
a
bandage
on
that
leg
valeria
ripped
a
length
of
silk
from
a
hanging
and
knotted
it
about
her
waist
then
tore
off
some
smaller
strips
which
she
bound
efficiently
about
the
barbarian
lacerated
limb
i
can
walk
on
it
he
assured
her
let
begone
it
dawn
outside
this
infernal
city
i
had
enough
of
xuchotl
it
well
the
breed
exterminated
itself
i
do
want
any
of
their
accursed
jewels
they
might
be
haunted
there
is
enough
clean
loot
in
the
world
for
you
and
me
she
said
straightening
to
stand
tall
and
splendid
before
him
the
old
blaze
came
back
in
his
eyes
and
this
time
she
did
not
resist
as
he
caught
her
fiercely
in
his
arms
it
a
long
way
to
the
coast
she
said
presently
withdrawing
her
lips
from
his
what
matter
he
laughed
there
nothing
we
ca
conquer
we
have
our
feet
on
a
ship
deck
before
the
stygians
open
their
ports
for
the
trading
season
and
then
we
show
the
world
what
plundering
means
