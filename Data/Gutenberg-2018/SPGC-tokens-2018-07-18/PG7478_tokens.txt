toby
tyler
or
ten
weeks
with
a
circus
by
james
otis
toby
introduction
to
the
circus
would
you
give
more
six
peanuts
for
a
cent
was
a
question
asked
by
a
very
small
boy
with
big
staring
eyes
of
a
candy
vender
at
a
circus
booth
and
as
he
spoke
he
looked
wistfully
at
the
quantity
of
nuts
piled
high
up
on
the
basket
and
then
at
the
six
each
of
which
now
looked
so
small
as
he
held
them
in
his
hand
could
do
it
was
the
reply
of
the
proprietor
of
the
booth
as
he
put
the
boy
penny
carefully
away
in
the
drawer
the
little
fellow
looked
for
another
moment
at
his
purchase
and
then
carefully
cracked
the
largest
one
a
shade
and
a
very
deep
shade
it
was
of
disappointment
passed
over
his
face
and
then
looking
up
anxiously
he
asked
do
you
swap
when
they
bad
the
man
face
looked
as
if
a
smile
had
been
a
stranger
to
it
for
a
long
time
but
one
did
pay
it
a
visit
just
then
and
he
tossed
the
boy
two
nuts
and
asked
him
a
question
at
the
same
time
what
is
your
name
the
big
brown
eyes
looked
up
for
an
instant
as
if
to
learn
whether
the
question
was
asked
in
good
faith
and
then
their
owner
said
as
he
carefully
picked
apart
another
nut
toby
well
that
a
queer
yes
i
so
myself
but
you
see
i
do
expect
that
the
name
that
belongs
to
me
but
the
fellers
call
me
so
an
so
does
uncle
who
is
uncle
daniel
was
the
next
question
in
the
absence
of
other
customers
the
man
seemed
disposed
to
get
as
much
amusement
out
of
the
boy
as
possible
he
hai
my
uncle
at
all
i
only
call
him
so
because
all
the
boys
do
an
i
live
with
where
your
father
and
mother
i
do
know
said
toby
rather
carelessly
i
do
know
much
about
an
uncle
says
they
do
know
much
about
me
here
another
bad
nut
goin
to
give
me
two
more
the
two
nuts
were
given
him
and
he
said
as
he
put
them
in
his
pocket
and
turned
over
and
over
again
those
which
he
held
in
his
hand
i
should
wonder
if
all
of
these
was
bad
you
give
me
two
for
each
one
of
before
i
crack
an
then
they
wo
be
spoiled
so
you
ca
sell
as
this
offer
of
barter
was
made
the
man
looked
amused
and
he
asked
as
he
counted
out
the
number
which
toby
desired
if
i
give
you
these
i
suppose
you
want
me
to
give
you
two
more
for
each
one
and
keep
that
kind
of
a
trade
going
until
you
get
my
whole
stock
i
wo
open
my
head
if
every
one
of
em
all
right
you
can
keep
what
you
got
and
i
give
you
these
besides
but
i
do
want
you
to
buy
any
more
for
i
do
want
to
do
that
kind
of
toby
took
the
nuts
offered
not
in
the
least
abashed
and
seated
himself
on
a
convenient
stone
to
eat
them
and
at
the
same
time
to
see
all
that
was
going
on
around
him
the
coming
of
a
circus
to
the
little
town
of
guilford
was
an
event
and
toby
had
hardly
thought
of
anything
else
since
the
highly
colored
posters
had
first
been
put
up
it
was
yet
quite
early
in
the
morning
and
the
tents
were
just
being
erected
by
the
men
toby
had
followed
with
eager
eyes
everything
that
looked
as
if
it
belonged
to
the
circus
from
the
time
the
first
wagon
had
entered
the
town
until
the
street
parade
had
been
made
and
everything
was
being
prepared
for
the
afternoon
performance
the
man
who
had
made
the
losing
trade
in
peanuts
seemed
disposed
to
question
the
boy
still
further
probably
owing
to
the
fact
that
he
had
nothing
better
to
do
who
is
this
uncle
daniel
you
say
you
live
with
is
he
a
farmer
no
he
a
deacon
an
he
raps
me
over
the
head
with
the
hymn
book
whenever
i
go
to
sleep
in
meetin
an
he
says
i
eat
four
times
as
much
as
i
earn
i
blame
him
for
hittin
so
hard
when
i
go
to
sleep
but
i
he
right
about
my
eatin
you
see
and
here
his
tone
grew
both
confidential
and
mournful
i
am
an
awful
eater
an
i
ca
seem
to
help
it
somehow
i
hungry
all
the
time
i
do
seem
ever
to
get
enough
till
carrot
time
comes
an
then
i
can
get
all
i
want
without
troublin
did
you
ever
have
enough
to
eat
i
i
did
but
you
see
uncle
he
found
me
one
mornin
on
his
hay
an
he
says
i
was
cryin
for
something
to
eat
then
an
i
kept
it
up
ever
since
i
tried
to
get
him
to
give
me
money
enough
to
go
into
the
circus
with
but
he
said
a
cent
was
all
he
could
spare
these
hard
times
an
i
better
take
that
an
buy
something
to
eat
with
it
for
the
show
was
very
good
anyway
i
wish
peanuts
was
but
a
cent
a
then
you
would
make
yourself
sick
eating
yes
i
i
should
uncle
says
i
eat
till
i
was
sick
if
i
got
the
chance
but
i
like
to
try
it
he
was
a
very
small
boy
with
a
round
head
covered
with
short
red
hair
a
face
as
speckled
as
any
turkey
egg
but
thoroughly
good
natured
looking
and
as
he
sat
there
on
the
rather
sharp
point
of
the
rock
swaying
his
body
to
and
fro
as
he
hugged
his
knees
with
his
hands
and
kept
his
eyes
fastened
on
the
tempting
display
of
good
things
before
him
it
would
have
been
a
very
hard
hearted
man
who
would
not
have
given
him
something
but
job
lord
the
proprietor
of
the
booth
was
a
hard
hearted
man
and
he
did
not
make
the
slightest
advance
toward
offering
the
little
fellow
anything
toby
rocked
himself
silently
for
a
moment
and
then
he
said
hesitatingly
i
do
suppose
you
like
to
sell
me
some
things
let
me
pay
you
when
i
get
older
would
you
lord
shook
his
head
decidedly
at
this
proposition
i
did
you
would
said
toby
quickly
but
you
did
seem
to
be
selling
anything
an
i
thought
i
just
see
what
you
say
about
and
then
he
appeared
suddenly
to
see
something
wonderfully
interesting
behind
him
which
served
as
an
excuse
to
turn
his
reddening
face
away
i
suppose
your
uncle
daniel
makes
you
work
for
your
living
do
he
asked
lord
after
he
had
rearranged
his
stock
of
candy
and
had
added
a
couple
of
slices
of
lemon
peel
to
what
was
popularly
supposed
to
be
lemonade
that
what
i
think
but
he
says
that
all
the
work
i
do
would
pay
for
the
meal
that
one
chicken
would
eat
an
i
it
so
for
i
do
like
to
work
as
well
as
a
feller
without
any
father
and
mother
ought
to
i
do
know
why
it
is
but
i
guess
it
because
i
take
up
so
much
time
eatin
that
it
kinder
tires
me
out
i
you
go
into
the
circus
whenever
you
want
to
do
you
oh
yes
i
there
at
every
performance
for
i
keep
the
stand
under
the
big
canvas
as
well
as
this
one
out
there
was
a
great
big
sigh
from
out
toby
little
round
stomach
as
he
thought
what
bliss
it
must
be
to
own
all
those
good
things
and
to
see
the
circus
wherever
it
went
it
must
be
nice
he
said
as
he
faced
the
booth
and
its
hard
visaged
proprietor
once
more
how
would
you
like
it
asked
lord
patronizingly
as
he
looked
toby
over
in
a
business
way
very
much
as
if
he
contemplated
purchasing
him
like
it
echoed
toby
why
i
grow
fat
on
it
i
do
know
as
that
would
be
any
advantage
continued
lord
reflectively
for
it
strikes
me
that
you
about
as
fat
now
as
a
boy
of
your
age
ought
to
be
but
i
a
great
mind
to
give
you
a
what
cried
toby
in
amazement
and
his
eyes
opened
to
their
widest
extent
as
this
possible
opportunity
of
leading
a
delightful
life
presented
itself
yes
i
a
great
mind
to
give
you
the
chance
you
see
and
now
it
was
lord
turn
to
grow
confidential
i
had
a
boy
with
me
this
season
but
he
cleared
out
at
the
last
town
and
i
running
the
business
alone
toby
face
expressed
all
the
contempt
he
felt
for
the
boy
who
would
run
away
from
such
a
glorious
life
as
lord
assistant
must
lead
but
he
said
not
a
word
waiting
in
breathless
expectation
for
the
offer
which
he
now
felt
certain
would
be
made
him
now
i
ai
hard
on
a
boy
continued
lord
still
confidentially
and
yet
that
one
seemed
to
think
that
he
was
treated
worse
and
made
to
work
harder
than
any
boy
in
the
he
ought
to
live
with
uncle
a
week
said
toby
eagerly
here
i
was
just
like
a
father
to
him
said
lord
paying
no
attention
to
the
interruption
and
i
gave
him
his
board
and
lodging
and
a
dollar
a
week
could
he
do
what
he
wanted
to
with
the
dollar
of
course
he
could
i
never
checked
him
no
matter
how
extravagant
he
was
an
yet
i
seen
him
spend
his
whole
week
wages
at
this
very
stand
in
one
afternoon
and
even
after
his
money
had
all
gone
that
way
i
paid
for
peppermint
and
ginger
out
of
my
own
pocket
just
to
cure
his
stomach
toby
shook
his
head
mournfully
as
if
deploring
that
depravity
which
could
cause
a
boy
to
run
away
from
such
a
tender
hearted
employer
and
from
such
a
desirable
position
but
even
as
he
shook
his
head
so
sadly
he
looked
wistfully
at
the
peanuts
and
lord
observed
the
look
it
may
have
been
that
job
lord
was
the
tender
hearted
man
he
prided
himself
upon
being
or
it
may
have
been
that
he
wished
to
purchase
toby
sympathy
but
at
all
events
he
gave
him
a
large
handful
of
nuts
and
toby
never
bothered
his
little
round
head
as
to
what
motive
prompted
the
gift
now
he
could
listen
to
the
story
of
the
treachery
and
eat
at
the
same
time
therefore
he
was
an
attentive
listener
all
in
the
world
that
boy
had
to
do
continued
lord
in
the
same
injured
tone
he
had
previously
used
was
to
help
me
set
things
to
rights
when
we
struck
a
town
in
the
morning
and
then
tend
to
the
counter
till
we
left
the
town
at
night
and
all
the
rest
of
the
time
he
had
to
himself
yet
that
boy
was
ungrateful
enough
to
run
lord
paused
as
if
expecting
some
expression
of
sympathy
from
his
listener
but
toby
was
so
busily
engaged
with
his
unexpected
feast
and
his
mouth
was
so
full
that
it
did
not
seem
even
possible
for
him
to
shake
his
head
now
what
should
you
say
if
i
told
you
that
you
looked
to
me
like
a
boy
that
was
made
especially
to
help
run
a
candy
counter
at
a
circus
and
if
i
offered
the
place
to
you
toby
made
one
frantic
effort
to
swallow
the
very
large
mouthful
and
in
a
choking
voice
he
answered
quickly
i
should
say
i
go
with
you
be
mighty
glad
of
the
then
it
a
bargain
my
boy
and
you
shall
leave
town
with
me
ii
toby
runs
away
from
home
toby
could
scarcely
restrain
himself
at
the
prospect
of
this
golden
future
that
had
so
suddenly
opened
before
him
he
tried
to
express
his
gratitude
but
could
only
do
so
by
evincing
his
willingness
to
commence
work
at
once
no
no
that
wo
do
said
lord
cautiously
if
your
uncle
daniel
should
see
you
working
here
he
might
mistrust
something
and
then
you
could
get
i
do
believe
he
try
to
stop
me
said
toby
confidently
for
told
me
lots
of
times
that
it
was
a
sorry
day
for
him
when
he
found
we
wo
take
any
chances
my
son
was
the
reply
in
a
very
benevolent
tone
as
he
patted
toby
on
the
head
and
at
the
same
time
handed
him
a
piece
of
pasteboard
there
a
ticket
for
the
circus
and
you
come
around
to
see
me
about
ten
tonight
i
put
you
on
one
of
the
wagons
and
by
tomorrow
morning
your
uncle
daniel
will
have
hard
work
to
find
if
toby
had
followed
his
inclinations
the
chances
are
that
he
would
have
fallen
on
his
knees
and
kissed
lord
hands
in
the
excess
of
his
gratitude
but
not
knowing
exactly
how
such
a
show
of
thankfulness
might
be
received
he
contented
himself
by
repeatedly
promising
that
he
would
be
punctual
to
the
time
and
place
appointed
he
would
have
loitered
in
the
vicinity
of
the
candy
stand
in
order
that
he
might
gain
some
insight
into
the
business
but
lord
advised
him
to
remain
away
lest
his
uncle
daniel
would
see
him
and
suspect
where
he
had
gone
when
he
was
missed
in
the
morning
as
toby
walked
around
the
circus
grounds
whereon
was
so
much
to
attract
his
attention
he
could
not
prevent
himself
from
assuming
an
air
of
proprietorship
his
interest
in
all
that
was
going
on
was
redoubled
and
in
his
anxiety
that
everything
should
be
done
correctly
and
in
the
proper
order
he
actually
and
perhaps
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
forgot
that
he
was
hungry
he
was
really
to
travel
with
a
circus
to
become
a
part
as
it
were
of
the
whole
and
to
be
able
to
see
its
many
wonderful
and
beautiful
attractions
every
day
even
the
very
tent
ropes
had
acquired
a
new
interest
for
him
and
the
faces
of
the
men
at
work
seemed
suddenly
to
have
become
those
of
friends
how
hard
it
was
for
him
to
walk
around
unconcernedly
and
how
especially
hard
to
prevent
his
feet
from
straying
toward
that
tempting
display
of
dainties
which
he
was
to
sell
to
those
who
came
to
see
and
enjoy
and
who
would
look
at
him
with
wonder
and
curiosity
it
was
very
hard
not
to
be
allowed
to
tell
his
playmates
of
his
wonderfully
good
fortune
but
silence
meant
success
and
he
locked
his
secret
in
his
bosom
not
even
daring
to
talk
with
anyone
he
knew
lest
he
should
betray
himself
by
some
incautious
word
he
did
not
go
home
to
dinner
that
day
and
once
or
twice
he
felt
impelled
to
walk
past
the
candy
stand
giving
a
mysterious
shake
of
the
head
at
the
proprietor
as
he
did
so
the
afternoon
performance
passed
off
as
usual
to
all
of
the
spectators
save
toby
he
imagined
that
each
one
of
the
performers
knew
that
he
was
about
to
join
them
and
even
as
he
passed
the
cage
containing
the
monkeys
he
fancied
that
one
particularly
old
one
knew
all
about
his
intention
of
running
away
of
course
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
go
home
at
the
close
of
the
afternoon
performance
in
order
to
get
one
or
two
valuable
articles
of
his
own
such
as
a
boat
a
kite
and
a
pair
of
skates
and
in
order
that
his
actions
might
not
seem
suspicious
before
he
left
the
grounds
however
he
stole
slyly
around
to
the
candy
stand
and
informed
job
lord
in
a
very
hoarse
whisper
that
he
would
be
on
hand
at
the
time
appointed
lord
patted
him
on
the
head
gave
him
two
large
sticks
of
candy
and
what
was
more
kind
and
surprising
considering
the
fact
that
he
wore
glasses
and
was
cross
eyed
he
winked
at
toby
a
wink
from
lord
must
have
been
intended
to
convey
a
great
deal
because
owing
to
the
defect
in
his
eyes
it
required
no
little
exertion
and
even
then
could
not
be
considered
as
a
really
first
class
wink
that
wink
distorted
as
it
was
gladdened
toby
heart
immensely
and
took
away
nearly
all
the
sting
of
the
scolding
with
which
uncle
daniel
greeted
him
when
he
reached
home
that
night
despite
the
fact
that
he
was
going
to
travel
with
the
circus
despite
the
fact
that
his
home
was
not
a
happy
or
cheerful
one
toby
was
not
in
a
pleasant
frame
of
mind
he
began
to
feel
for
the
first
time
that
he
was
doing
wrong
and
as
he
gazed
at
uncle
stern
forbidding
looking
face
it
seemed
to
have
changed
somewhat
from
its
severity
and
caused
a
great
lump
of
something
to
come
up
in
his
throat
as
he
thought
that
perhaps
he
should
never
see
it
again
just
then
one
or
two
kind
words
would
have
prevented
him
from
running
away
bright
as
the
prospect
of
circus
life
appeared
it
was
almost
impossible
for
him
to
eat
anything
and
this
very
surprising
state
of
affairs
attracted
the
attention
of
uncle
daniel
bless
my
heart
what
ails
the
boy
asked
the
old
man
as
he
peered
over
his
glasses
at
toby
well
filled
plate
which
was
usually
emptied
so
quickly
are
ye
sick
toby
or
what
is
the
matter
with
ye
no
i
hai
sick
said
toby
with
a
sigh
but
i
been
to
the
circus
an
i
got
a
good
deal
to
oho
you
spent
that
cent
i
give
ye
eh
an
got
so
much
that
it
made
ye
sick
toby
thought
of
the
six
peanuts
which
he
had
bought
with
the
penny
uncle
daniel
had
given
him
and
amid
all
his
homesickness
he
could
not
help
wondering
if
uncle
daniel
ever
made
himself
sick
with
only
six
peanuts
when
he
was
a
boy
as
no
one
paid
any
further
attention
to
toby
he
pushed
back
his
plate
arose
from
the
table
and
went
with
a
heavy
heart
to
attend
to
his
regular
evening
chores
the
cow
the
hens
and
even
the
pigs
came
in
for
a
share
of
his
unusually
kind
attention
and
as
he
fed
them
all
the
big
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
as
he
thought
that
perhaps
never
again
would
he
see
any
of
them
these
dumb
animals
had
all
been
confidants
he
had
poured
out
his
griefs
in
their
ears
and
fancied
when
the
world
or
uncle
daniel
had
used
him
unusually
hard
that
they
sympathized
with
him
now
he
was
leaving
them
forever
and
as
he
locked
the
stable
door
he
could
hear
the
sounds
of
music
coming
from
the
direction
of
the
circus
grounds
and
he
was
angry
at
it
because
it
represented
that
which
was
taking
him
away
from
his
home
even
though
it
was
not
as
pleasant
as
it
might
have
been
still
he
had
no
thought
of
breaking
the
engagement
which
he
had
made
he
went
to
his
room
made
a
bundle
of
his
worldly
possessions
and
crept
out
of
the
back
door
down
the
road
to
the
circus
lord
saw
him
as
soon
as
he
arrived
on
the
grounds
and
as
he
passed
another
ticket
to
toby
he
took
his
bundle
from
him
saying
as
he
did
so
i
pack
up
your
bundle
with
my
things
and
then
you
be
sure
not
to
lose
it
do
you
want
some
candy
toby
shook
his
head
he
had
just
discovered
that
there
was
possibly
some
connection
between
his
heart
and
his
stomach
for
his
grief
at
leaving
home
had
taken
from
him
all
desire
for
good
things
it
is
also
more
than
possible
that
lord
had
had
experience
enough
with
boys
to
know
that
they
might
be
homesick
on
the
eve
of
starting
to
travel
with
a
circus
and
in
order
to
make
sure
that
toby
would
keep
to
his
engagement
he
was
unusually
kind
that
evening
was
the
longest
toby
ever
knew
he
wandered
from
one
cage
of
animals
to
another
then
to
see
the
performance
in
the
ring
and
back
again
to
the
animals
in
the
vain
hope
of
passing
the
time
pleasantly
but
it
was
of
no
use
that
lump
in
his
throat
would
remain
there
and
the
thoughts
of
what
he
was
about
to
do
would
trouble
him
severely
the
performance
failed
to
interest
him
and
the
animals
did
not
attract
until
he
had
visited
the
monkey
cage
for
the
third
or
fourth
time
then
he
fancied
that
the
same
venerable
monkey
who
had
looked
so
knowing
in
the
afternoon
was
gazing
at
him
with
a
sadness
which
could
only
have
come
from
a
thorough
knowledge
of
all
the
grief
and
doubt
that
was
in
his
heart
there
was
no
one
around
the
cages
and
toby
got
just
as
near
to
the
iron
bars
as
possible
no
sooner
had
he
flattened
his
little
pug
nose
against
the
iron
than
the
aged
monkey
came
down
from
the
ring
in
which
he
had
been
swinging
and
seating
himself
directly
in
front
of
toby
face
looked
at
him
most
compassionately
it
would
not
have
surprised
the
boy
just
then
if
the
animal
had
spoken
but
as
he
did
not
toby
did
the
next
best
thing
and
spoke
to
him
i
you
remember
that
you
saw
me
this
afternoon
an
somebody
told
you
that
i
was
goin
to
join
the
circus
did
they
the
monkey
made
no
reply
though
toby
fancied
that
he
winked
an
affirmative
answer
and
he
looked
so
sympathetic
that
he
continued
confidentially
well
i
the
same
feller
an
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
awfully
sorry
that
i
promised
that
candy
man
i
go
with
him
do
you
know
that
i
came
near
crying
at
the
supper
table
tonight
an
uncle
looked
real
good
an
nice
though
i
never
thought
so
before
i
wish
i
was
goin
after
all
it
do
seem
a
bit
like
a
good
time
now
but
i
i
must
i
promised
to
an
the
candy
man
has
got
all
my
the
big
tears
had
begun
to
roll
down
toby
cheeks
and
as
he
ceased
speaking
the
monkey
reached
out
one
little
paw
which
toby
took
as
earnestly
as
if
it
had
been
done
purposely
to
console
him
you
real
good
you
are
continued
toby
an
i
hope
i
shall
see
you
real
often
for
it
seems
to
me
now
when
there
hai
any
folks
around
as
if
you
was
the
only
friend
i
got
in
this
great
big
world
awful
when
a
feller
feels
the
way
i
do
an
when
he
do
seem
to
want
anything
to
eat
now
if
you
stick
to
me
i
stick
to
you
an
then
it
wo
be
half
so
bad
when
we
feel
this
during
this
speech
toby
had
still
clung
to
the
little
brown
paw
which
the
monkey
now
withdrew
and
continued
to
gaze
into
the
boy
face
the
fellers
all
say
i
do
amount
to
anything
sobbed
toby
uncle
says
i
do
an
i
they
know
but
i
tell
you
i
feel
just
as
bad
now
that
i
goin
away
from
them
all
as
if
i
was
as
good
as
any
of
at
this
moment
toby
saw
lord
enter
the
tent
and
he
knew
that
the
summons
to
start
was
about
to
be
given
goodby
he
said
to
the
monkey
as
he
vainly
tried
to
take
him
by
the
hand
again
remember
what
i
told
you
an
do
forget
that
toby
tyler
is
feelin
worse
tonight
than
if
he
was
twice
as
big
an
twice
as
lord
had
come
to
summon
him
away
and
he
now
told
toby
that
he
would
show
him
with
which
man
he
was
to
ride
that
night
toby
looked
another
goodby
at
the
venerable
monkey
who
was
watching
him
closely
and
then
followed
his
employer
out
of
the
tent
among
the
ropes
and
poles
and
general
confusion
attendant
upon
the
removal
of
a
circus
from
one
place
to
another
iii
the
night
ride
the
wagon
on
which
lord
was
to
send
his
new
found
employee
was
by
the
most
singular
chance
the
one
containing
the
monkeys
and
toby
accepted
this
as
a
good
omen
he
would
be
near
his
venerable
friend
all
night
and
there
was
some
consolation
in
that
the
driver
instructed
the
boy
to
watch
his
movements
and
when
he
saw
him
leading
his
horses
around
to
look
lively
and
be
on
hand
for
he
never
waited
for
toby
not
only
promised
to
do
as
ordered
but
he
followed
the
driver
around
so
closely
that
had
he
desired
he
could
not
have
rid
himself
of
his
little
companion
the
scene
which
presented
itself
to
toby
view
was
strange
and
weird
in
the
extreme
shortly
after
he
had
attached
himself
to
the
man
with
whom
he
was
to
ride
the
performance
was
over
and
the
work
of
putting
the
show
and
its
belongings
into
such
a
shape
as
could
be
conveyed
from
one
town
to
another
was
soon
in
active
operation
toby
forgot
his
grief
forgot
that
he
was
running
away
from
the
only
home
he
had
ever
known
in
fact
forgot
everything
concerning
himself
so
interested
was
he
in
that
which
was
going
on
about
him
as
soon
as
the
audience
had
got
out
of
the
tent
and
almost
before
the
work
of
taking
down
the
canvas
was
begun
torches
were
stuck
in
the
earth
at
regular
intervals
the
lights
that
had
shone
so
brilliantly
in
and
around
the
ring
had
been
extinguished
the
canvas
sides
had
been
taken
off
and
the
boards
that
had
formed
the
seats
were
being
packed
into
one
of
the
carts
with
a
rattling
sound
that
seemed
as
if
a
regular
fusillade
of
musketry
was
being
indulged
in
men
were
shouting
horses
were
being
driven
hither
and
thither
harnessed
to
the
wagons
or
drawing
the
huge
carts
away
as
soon
as
they
were
loaded
and
everything
seemed
in
the
greatest
state
of
confusion
while
really
the
work
was
being
done
in
the
most
systematic
manner
possible
toby
had
not
long
to
wait
before
the
driver
informed
him
that
the
time
for
starting
had
arrived
and
assisted
him
to
climb
up
to
the
narrow
seat
whereon
he
was
to
ride
that
night
the
scene
was
so
exciting
and
his
efforts
to
stick
to
the
narrow
seat
so
great
that
he
really
had
no
time
to
attend
to
the
homesick
feeling
that
had
crept
over
him
during
the
first
part
of
the
evening
the
long
procession
of
carts
and
wagons
drove
slowly
out
of
the
town
and
when
the
last
familiar
house
had
been
passed
the
driver
spoke
to
toby
for
the
first
time
since
they
started
pretty
hard
work
to
keep
on
eh
sonny
yes
replied
the
boy
as
the
wagon
jolted
over
a
rock
bouncing
him
high
in
air
and
he
by
strenuous
efforts
barely
succeeded
in
alighting
on
the
seat
again
it
is
pretty
hard
work
an
my
name
toby
toby
heard
a
queer
sound
that
seemed
to
come
from
the
man
throat
and
for
a
few
moments
he
feared
that
his
companion
was
choking
but
he
soon
understood
that
this
was
simply
an
attempt
to
laugh
and
he
at
once
decided
that
it
was
a
very
poor
style
of
laughing
so
you
object
to
being
called
sonny
do
you
well
i
rather
be
called
toby
for
you
see
that
my
all
right
my
boy
we
call
you
toby
i
suppose
you
thought
it
was
a
mighty
fine
thing
to
run
away
an
jine
a
circus
did
you
toby
started
in
affright
looked
around
cautiously
and
then
tried
to
peer
down
through
the
small
square
aperture
guarded
by
iron
rods
that
opened
into
the
cage
just
back
of
the
seat
they
were
sitting
on
then
he
turned
slowly
around
to
the
driver
and
asked
in
a
voice
sunk
to
a
whisper
how
did
you
know
that
i
was
runnin
away
did
he
tell
you
and
toby
motioned
with
his
thumb
as
if
he
were
pointing
out
someone
behind
him
it
was
the
driver
turn
now
to
look
around
in
search
of
the
he
referred
to
by
toby
who
do
you
mean
asked
the
man
impatiently
why
the
old
feller
the
one
in
the
cart
there
i
think
he
knew
i
was
runnin
away
though
he
did
say
anything
about
it
but
he
looked
just
as
if
he
the
driver
looked
at
toby
in
perfect
amazement
for
a
moment
and
then
as
if
suddenly
understanding
the
boy
relapsed
into
one
of
those
convulsive
efforts
that
caused
the
blood
to
rush
up
into
his
face
and
gave
him
every
appearance
of
having
a
fit
you
must
mean
one
of
the
monkeys
said
the
driver
after
he
had
recovered
his
breath
which
had
been
almost
shaken
out
of
his
body
by
the
silent
laughter
so
you
thought
a
monkey
had
told
me
what
any
fool
could
have
seen
if
he
had
watched
you
for
five
well
said
toby
slowly
as
if
he
feared
he
might
provoke
one
of
those
terrible
laughing
spells
again
i
saw
him
tonight
an
he
looked
as
if
he
knew
what
i
was
doin
so
i
up
an
told
him
an
i
did
know
but
he
told
you
though
he
did
look
to
me
like
a
feller
that
would
be
there
was
another
internal
shaking
on
the
part
of
the
driver
which
toby
did
not
fear
so
much
since
he
was
getting
accustomed
to
it
and
then
the
man
said
well
you
are
the
queerest
little
cove
i
ever
i
i
am
was
the
reply
accompanied
by
a
long
drawn
sigh
i
do
seem
to
amount
to
so
much
as
the
other
fellers
do
an
i
guess
it
because
i
always
hungry
you
see
i
eat
awful
uncle
the
only
reply
which
the
driver
made
to
this
plaintive
confession
was
to
put
his
hand
down
into
the
deepest
recesses
of
one
of
his
deep
pockets
and
to
draw
therefrom
a
huge
doughnut
which
he
handed
to
his
companion
toby
was
so
much
at
his
ease
by
this
time
that
the
appetite
which
had
failed
him
at
supper
had
now
returned
in
full
force
and
he
devoured
the
doughnut
in
a
most
ravenous
manner
you
too
small
to
eat
so
fast
said
the
man
in
a
warning
tone
as
the
last
morsel
of
the
greasy
sweetness
disappeared
and
he
fished
up
another
for
the
boy
some
time
you
get
hold
of
one
of
the
india
rubber
doughnuts
that
they
feed
to
circus
people
an
choke
yourself
to
toby
shook
his
head
and
devoured
this
second
cake
as
quickly
as
he
had
the
first
craning
his
neck
and
uttering
a
funny
little
squeak
as
the
last
bit
went
down
just
as
a
chicken
does
when
he
gets
too
large
a
mouthful
of
dough
i
never
choke
he
said
confidently
i
used
to
it
and
uncle
says
i
could
eat
a
pair
of
boots
an
never
wink
at
but
i
do
just
believe
as
the
driver
made
no
reply
to
this
remark
toby
watched
with
no
little
interest
all
that
was
passing
on
around
him
each
of
the
wagons
had
a
lantern
fastened
to
the
hind
axle
and
these
lights
could
be
seen
far
ahead
on
the
road
as
if
a
party
of
fireflies
had
started
in
single
file
on
an
excursion
the
trees
by
the
side
of
the
road
stood
out
weird
and
ghostly
looking
in
the
darkness
and
the
rumble
of
the
carts
ahead
and
behind
formed
a
musical
accompaniment
to
the
picture
that
sounded
strangely
doleful
mile
after
mile
was
passed
over
in
perfect
silence
save
now
and
then
when
the
driver
would
whistle
a
few
bars
of
some
very
dismal
tune
that
would
fairly
make
toby
shiver
with
its
mournfulness
eighteen
miles
was
the
distance
from
guilford
to
the
town
where
the
next
performance
of
the
circus
was
to
be
given
and
as
toby
thought
of
the
ride
before
them
it
seemed
as
if
the
time
would
be
almost
interminable
he
curled
himself
up
on
one
corner
of
the
seat
and
tried
very
hard
to
go
to
sleep
but
just
as
his
eyes
began
to
grow
heavy
the
wagon
would
jolt
over
some
rock
or
sink
deep
in
some
rut
till
toby
the
breath
very
nearly
shaken
out
of
his
body
and
his
neck
almost
dislocated
would
sit
bolt
upright
clinging
to
the
seat
with
both
hands
as
if
he
expected
each
moment
to
be
pitched
out
into
the
mud
the
driver
watched
him
closely
and
each
time
that
he
saw
him
shaken
up
and
awakened
so
thoroughly
he
would
indulge
in
one
of
his
silent
laughing
spells
until
toby
would
wonder
whether
he
would
ever
recover
from
it
several
times
had
toby
been
awakened
and
each
time
he
had
seen
the
amusement
his
sufferings
caused
until
he
finally
resolved
to
put
an
end
to
the
sport
by
keeping
awake
what
is
your
name
he
asked
of
the
driver
thinking
a
conversation
would
be
the
best
way
to
rouse
himself
into
wakefulness
waal
said
the
driver
as
he
gathered
the
reins
carefully
in
one
hand
and
seemed
to
be
debating
in
his
mind
how
he
should
answer
the
question
i
do
know
as
i
know
myself
it
been
so
long
since
i
heard
toby
was
wide
enough
awake
now
as
this
rather
singular
problem
was
forced
upon
his
mind
he
revolved
the
matter
silently
for
some
moments
and
at
last
he
asked
what
do
folks
call
you
when
they
want
to
speak
to
you
they
always
call
me
old
ben
an
i
got
so
used
to
the
name
that
i
do
need
any
toby
wanted
very
much
to
ask
more
questions
but
he
wisely
concluded
that
it
would
not
be
agreeable
to
his
companion
i
ask
the
old
man
about
it
said
toby
to
himself
referring
to
the
aged
monkey
whom
he
seemed
to
feel
acquainted
with
he
most
likely
knows
if
he
say
after
this
the
conversation
ceased
until
toby
again
ventured
to
suggest
it
a
pretty
long
drive
hai
it
you
want
to
wait
till
you
been
in
this
business
a
year
or
two
said
ben
sagely
an
then
you
wo
think
much
of
it
why
i
known
the
show
towns
to
be
thirty
miles
apart
an
them
was
the
times
when
we
had
lively
work
of
it
riding
all
night
and
working
all
day
kind
of
wears
on
a
yes
i
so
said
toby
with
a
sigh
as
he
wondered
whether
he
had
got
to
work
as
hard
as
that
but
i
you
get
all
you
want
to
eat
do
you
now
you
struck
it
said
ben
with
the
air
of
one
about
to
impart
a
world
of
wisdom
as
he
crossed
one
leg
over
the
other
that
his
position
might
be
as
comfortable
as
possible
while
he
was
initiating
his
young
companion
into
the
mysteries
of
the
life
i
had
all
the
boys
ride
with
me
since
i
been
with
this
show
an
i
tried
to
start
them
right
but
they
did
seem
to
profit
by
it
an
always
got
sick
of
the
show
an
run
away
just
because
they
did
look
out
for
themselves
as
they
ought
to
now
listen
to
me
toby
an
remember
what
i
say
you
see
they
put
us
all
in
a
hotel
together
an
some
of
these
places
where
we
go
do
have
any
too
much
stuff
on
the
table
whenever
we
strike
a
new
town
you
find
out
at
the
hotel
what
time
they
have
the
grub
ready
you
be
on
hand
so
to
get
in
with
the
first
eat
all
you
can
an
fill
your
if
that
all
a
feller
has
to
do
to
travel
with
a
circus
said
toby
i
just
the
one
i
always
used
to
do
just
that
when
i
any
idea
of
bein
a
circus
then
you
get
along
all
right
said
ben
as
he
checked
the
speed
of
his
horses
and
looking
carefully
ahead
said
as
he
guided
his
team
to
one
side
of
the
road
this
is
as
far
as
we
going
toby
learned
that
they
were
within
a
couple
of
miles
of
the
town
and
that
the
entire
procession
would
remain
by
the
roadside
until
time
to
make
the
grand
entree
into
the
village
when
every
wagon
horse
and
man
would
be
decked
out
in
the
most
gorgeous
array
as
they
had
been
when
they
entered
guilford
under
ben
direction
he
wrapped
himself
in
an
old
horse
blanket
and
lay
down
on
the
top
of
the
wagon
and
he
was
so
tired
from
the
excitement
of
the
day
and
night
that
he
had
hardly
stretched
out
at
full
length
before
he
was
fast
asleep
iv
the
first
day
with
the
circus
when
toby
awakened
and
looked
around
he
could
hardly
realize
where
he
was
or
bow
he
came
there
as
far
ahead
and
behind
on
the
road
as
he
could
see
the
carts
were
drawn
up
on
one
side
men
were
hurrying
to
and
fro
orders
were
being
shouted
and
everything
showed
that
the
entry
into
the
town
was
about
to
be
made
directly
opposite
the
wagon
on
which
he
had
been
sleeping
were
the
four
elephants
and
two
camels
and
close
behind
contentedly
munching
their
breakfasts
were
a
number
of
tiny
ponies
troops
of
horses
were
being
groomed
and
attended
to
the
road
was
littered
with
saddles
flags
and
general
decorations
until
it
seemed
to
toby
that
there
must
have
been
a
smash
up
and
that
he
now
beheld
ruins
rather
than
systematic
disorder
how
different
everything
looked
now
compared
to
the
time
when
the
cavalcade
marched
into
guilford
dazzling
everyone
with
the
gorgeous
display
then
the
horses
pranced
gayly
under
their
gaudy
decorations
the
wagons
were
bright
with
glass
gilt
and
flags
the
lumbering
elephants
and
awkward
camels
were
covered
with
fancifully
embroidered
velvets
and
even
the
drivers
of
the
wagons
were
resplendent
in
their
uniforms
of
scarlet
and
gold
now
in
the
gray
light
of
the
early
morning
everything
was
changed
the
horses
were
tired
and
muddy
and
wore
old
and
dirty
harness
the
gilded
chariots
were
covered
with
mud
bespattered
canvas
which
caused
them
to
look
like
the
most
ordinary
of
market
wagons
the
elephants
and
camels
looked
dingy
dirty
almost
repulsive
and
the
drivers
were
only
a
sleepy
looking
set
of
men
who
in
their
shirt
sleeves
were
getting
ready
for
the
change
which
would
dazzle
the
eyes
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
toby
descended
from
his
lofty
bed
rubbed
his
eyes
to
thoroughly
awaken
himself
and
under
the
guidance
of
ben
went
to
a
little
brook
near
by
and
washed
his
face
he
had
been
with
the
circus
not
quite
ten
hours
but
now
he
could
not
realize
that
it
had
ever
seemed
bright
and
beautiful
he
missed
his
comfortable
bed
the
quiet
and
cleanliness
and
the
well
spread
table
even
although
he
had
felt
the
lack
of
care
uncle
daniel
home
seemed
the
very
abode
of
love
and
friendly
feeling
compared
with
this
condition
where
no
one
appeared
to
care
even
enough
for
him
to
scold
at
him
he
was
thoroughly
homesick
and
heartily
wished
that
he
was
back
in
his
old
native
town
while
he
was
washing
his
face
in
the
brook
he
saw
some
of
the
boys
who
had
come
out
from
the
town
to
catch
the
first
glimpse
of
the
circus
and
he
saw
at
once
that
he
was
the
object
of
their
admiring
gaze
he
heard
one
of
the
boys
say
when
they
first
discovered
him
there
one
of
them
an
he
only
a
little
feller
so
i
going
to
talk
to
the
evident
admiration
which
the
boys
had
for
toby
pleased
him
and
this
pleasure
was
the
only
drop
of
comfort
he
had
had
since
he
started
he
hoped
they
would
come
and
talk
with
him
and
that
they
might
have
the
opportunity
he
was
purposely
slow
in
making
his
toilet
the
boys
approached
him
shyly
as
if
they
had
their
doubts
whether
he
was
made
of
the
same
material
as
themselves
and
when
they
got
quite
near
to
him
and
satisfied
themselves
that
he
was
only
washing
his
face
in
much
the
same
way
that
any
well
regulated
boy
would
do
the
one
who
had
called
attention
to
him
said
half
timidly
hello
hello
responded
toby
in
a
tone
that
was
meant
to
invite
confidence
do
you
belong
to
the
circus
yes
said
toby
a
little
doubtfully
then
the
boys
stared
at
him
again
as
if
he
were
one
of
the
strange
looking
animals
and
the
one
who
had
been
the
spokesman
drew
a
long
breath
of
envy
as
he
said
longingly
my
what
a
nice
time
you
must
have
toby
remembered
that
only
yesterday
he
himself
had
thought
that
boys
must
have
a
nice
time
with
a
circus
and
he
now
felt
what
a
mistake
that
thought
was
but
he
concluded
that
he
would
not
undeceive
his
new
acquaintance
and
do
they
give
you
frogs
to
eat
so
to
make
you
limber
this
was
the
first
time
that
toby
had
thought
of
breakfast
and
the
very
mention
of
eating
made
him
hungry
he
was
just
at
that
moment
so
very
hungry
that
he
did
not
think
he
was
replying
to
the
question
when
he
said
quickly
eat
frogs
i
could
eat
anything
if
i
only
had
the
the
boys
took
this
as
an
answer
to
their
question
and
felt
perfectly
convinced
that
the
agility
of
circus
riders
and
tumblers
depended
upon
the
quantity
of
frogs
eaten
and
they
looked
upon
toby
with
no
little
degree
of
awe
toby
might
have
undeceived
them
as
to
the
kind
of
food
he
ate
but
just
at
that
moment
the
harsh
voice
of
job
lord
was
heard
calling
him
and
he
hurried
away
to
commence
his
first
day
work
toby
employer
was
not
the
same
pleasant
kindly
spoken
man
that
he
had
been
during
the
time
they
were
in
guilford
and
before
the
boy
was
absolutely
under
his
control
he
looked
cross
he
acted
cross
and
it
did
not
take
the
boy
very
long
to
find
out
that
he
was
very
cross
he
scolded
toby
roundly
and
launched
more
oaths
at
his
defenseless
head
than
toby
had
ever
heard
in
his
life
he
was
angry
that
the
boy
had
not
been
on
hand
to
help
him
and
also
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
hunt
for
him
toby
tried
to
explain
that
he
had
no
idea
of
what
he
was
expected
to
do
and
that
he
had
been
on
the
wagon
to
which
he
had
been
sent
only
leaving
it
to
wash
his
face
but
the
angry
man
grew
still
more
furious
went
to
wash
your
face
did
yer
want
to
set
yourself
up
for
a
dandy
i
suppose
and
think
that
you
must
souse
that
speckled
face
of
yours
into
every
brook
you
come
to
i
soon
break
you
of
that
and
the
sooner
you
understand
that
i
ca
afford
to
have
you
wasting
your
time
in
washing
the
better
it
will
be
for
toby
now
grew
angry
and
not
realizing
how
wholly
he
was
in
the
power
he
retorted
if
you
think
i
going
round
with
a
dirty
face
even
if
it
is
speckled
for
a
dollar
a
week
you
mistaken
all
how
many
folks
would
eat
your
candy
if
they
knew
you
handled
it
over
before
you
washed
your
hands
oho
i
picked
up
a
preacher
have
i
now
i
want
you
to
understand
my
bantam
that
i
do
all
the
preaching
as
well
as
the
practicing
myself
and
this
is
about
as
quick
a
way
as
i
know
of
to
make
you
understand
as
the
man
spoke
he
grasped
the
boy
by
the
coat
collar
with
one
hand
and
with
the
other
plied
a
thin
rubber
cane
with
no
gentle
force
to
every
portion
of
toby
body
that
he
could
reach
every
blow
caused
the
poor
boy
the
most
intense
pain
but
he
determined
that
his
tormentor
should
not
have
the
satisfaction
of
forcing
an
outcry
from
him
and
he
closed
his
lips
so
tightly
that
not
a
single
sound
could
escape
from
them
this
very
silence
enraged
the
man
so
much
that
he
redoubled
the
force
and
rapidity
of
his
blows
and
it
is
impossible
to
say
what
might
have
been
the
consequences
had
not
ben
come
that
way
just
then
and
changed
the
aspect
of
affairs
up
to
your
old
tricks
of
whipping
the
boys
are
you
job
he
said
as
he
wrested
the
cane
from
the
man
hand
and
held
him
off
at
length
to
prevent
him
from
doing
toby
more
mischief
lord
struggled
to
release
himself
and
insisted
that
since
the
boy
was
in
his
employ
he
should
do
with
him
just
as
he
saw
fit
now
look
here
lord
said
ben
as
gravely
as
if
he
was
delivering
some
profound
piece
of
wisdom
i
never
interfered
with
you
before
but
now
i
going
to
stop
your
game
of
thrashing
your
boy
every
morning
before
breakfast
you
just
tell
this
youngster
what
you
want
him
to
do
and
if
he
do
do
it
you
can
discharge
him
if
i
hear
of
your
flogging
him
i
shall
attend
to
your
case
at
once
you
hear
me
ben
shook
the
now
terrified
candy
vender
much
as
if
he
had
been
a
child
and
then
released
him
saying
to
toby
as
he
did
so
now
my
boy
you
attend
to
your
business
as
you
ought
to
and
i
settle
his
accounts
if
he
tries
the
flogging
game
you
see
i
do
know
what
there
is
for
me
to
do
sobbed
toby
for
the
kindly
interference
of
ben
had
made
him
show
more
feeling
than
lord
blows
had
done
tell
him
what
he
must
do
said
ben
sternly
i
want
him
to
go
to
work
and
wash
the
tumblers
and
fix
up
the
things
in
that
green
box
so
we
can
commence
to
sell
as
soon
as
we
get
into
town
snarled
lord
as
he
motioned
toward
a
large
green
chest
that
had
been
taken
out
of
one
of
the
carts
and
which
toby
saw
was
filled
with
dirty
glasses
spoons
knives
and
other
utensils
such
as
were
necessary
to
carry
on
the
business
toby
got
a
pail
of
water
from
the
brook
hunted
around
and
found
towels
and
soap
and
devoted
himself
to
his
work
with
such
industry
that
lord
could
not
repress
a
grunt
of
satisfaction
as
he
passed
him
however
angry
he
felt
because
he
could
not
administer
the
whipping
which
would
have
smoothed
his
ruffled
temper
by
the
time
the
procession
was
ready
to
start
for
the
town
toby
had
as
much
of
his
work
done
as
he
could
find
that
it
was
necessary
to
do
and
his
master
in
his
surly
way
half
acknowledged
that
this
last
boy
of
his
was
better
than
any
he
had
had
before
although
toby
had
done
his
work
so
well
he
was
far
from
feeling
happy
he
was
both
angry
and
sad
as
he
thought
of
the
cruel
blows
that
had
been
inflicted
and
he
had
plenty
of
leisure
to
repent
of
the
rash
step
he
had
taken
although
he
could
not
see
very
clearly
how
he
was
to
get
away
from
it
he
thought
that
he
could
not
go
back
to
guilford
for
uncle
daniel
would
not
allow
him
to
come
to
his
house
again
and
the
hot
scalding
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
as
he
realized
that
he
was
homeless
and
friendless
in
this
great
big
world
it
was
while
he
was
in
this
frame
of
mind
that
the
procession
all
gaudy
with
flags
streamers
and
banners
entered
the
town
under
different
circumstances
this
would
have
been
a
most
delightful
day
for
him
for
the
entrance
of
a
circus
into
guilford
had
always
been
a
source
of
one
day
solid
enjoyment
but
now
he
was
the
most
disconsolate
and
unhappy
boy
in
all
that
crowd
he
did
not
ride
throughout
the
entire
route
of
the
procession
for
lord
was
anxious
to
begin
business
and
the
moment
the
tenting
ground
was
reached
the
wagon
containing
lord
goods
was
driven
into
the
inclosure
and
toby
day
work
began
he
was
obliged
to
bring
water
to
cut
up
the
lemons
fetch
and
carry
fruit
from
the
booth
in
the
big
tent
to
the
booth
on
the
outside
until
he
was
ready
to
drop
with
fatigue
and
having
had
no
time
for
breakfast
was
nearly
famished
it
was
quite
noon
before
he
was
permitted
to
go
to
the
hotel
for
something
to
eat
and
then
ben
advice
to
be
one
of
the
first
to
get
to
the
tables
was
not
needed
in
the
eating
line
that
day
he
astonished
the
servants
the
members
of
the
company
and
even
himself
and
by
the
time
he
arose
from
the
table
with
both
pockets
and
his
stomach
full
to
bursting
the
tables
had
been
set
and
cleared
away
twice
while
he
was
making
one
meal
well
i
guess
you
did
hurry
yourself
much
said
lord
when
toby
returned
to
the
circus
ground
oh
yes
i
did
was
toby
innocent
reply
i
ate
just
as
fast
as
i
could
and
a
satisfied
smile
stole
over
the
boy
face
as
he
thought
of
the
amount
of
solid
food
he
had
consumed
the
answer
was
not
one
which
was
calculated
to
make
lord
feel
any
more
agreeably
disposed
toward
his
new
clerk
and
he
showed
his
ill
temper
very
plainly
as
he
said
it
must
take
a
good
deal
to
satisfy
i
it
does
calmly
replied
toby
sam
merrill
used
to
say
that
i
took
after
aunt
olive
and
uncle
one
ate
a
good
while
an
the
other
ate
awful
toby
could
not
understand
what
it
was
that
lord
said
in
reply
but
he
could
understand
that
his
employer
was
angry
at
somebody
or
something
and
he
tried
unusually
hard
to
please
him
he
talked
to
the
boys
who
had
gathered
around
to
induce
them
to
buy
washed
the
glasses
as
fast
as
they
were
used
tried
to
keep
off
the
flies
and
in
every
way
he
could
think
of
endeavored
to
please
his
master
the
counterfeit
ten
cent
piece
when
the
doors
of
the
big
tent
were
opened
and
the
people
began
to
crowd
in
just
as
toby
had
seen
them
do
at
guilford
lord
announced
to
his
young
clerk
that
it
was
time
for
him
to
go
into
the
tent
to
work
then
it
was
that
toby
learned
for
the
first
time
that
he
had
two
masters
instead
of
one
and
this
knowledge
caused
him
no
little
uneasiness
if
the
other
one
was
anything
like
lord
his
lot
would
be
just
twice
as
bad
and
he
began
to
wonder
whether
he
could
even
stand
it
one
day
longer
as
the
boy
passed
through
the
tent
on
his
way
to
the
candy
stand
where
he
was
really
to
enter
upon
the
duties
for
which
he
had
run
away
from
home
he
wanted
to
stop
for
a
moment
and
speak
with
the
old
monkey
who
he
thought
had
taken
such
an
interest
in
him
but
when
he
reached
the
cage
in
which
his
friend
was
confined
there
was
such
a
crowd
around
it
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
get
near
enough
to
speak
without
being
overheard
this
was
such
a
disappointment
to
the
little
fellow
that
the
big
tears
came
into
his
eyes
and
in
another
instant
would
have
gone
rolling
down
his
cheeks
if
his
aged
friend
had
not
chanced
to
look
toward
him
toby
fancied
that
the
monkey
looked
at
him
in
the
most
friendly
way
and
then
he
was
certain
that
he
winked
one
eye
toby
felt
that
there
was
no
mistake
about
that
wink
and
it
seemed
as
if
it
was
intended
to
convey
comfort
to
him
in
his
troubles
he
winked
back
at
the
monkey
in
the
most
emphatic
and
grave
manner
possible
and
then
went
on
his
way
feeling
wonderfully
comforted
the
work
inside
the
tent
was
far
different
and
much
harder
than
it
was
outside
he
was
obliged
to
carry
around
among
the
audience
trays
of
candy
nuts
and
lemonade
for
sale
and
he
was
expected
to
cry
aloud
the
description
of
that
which
he
offered
the
partner
of
lord
who
had
charge
of
the
stand
inside
the
tent
showed
himself
to
be
neither
better
nor
worse
than
lord
himself
when
toby
first
presented
himself
for
work
he
handed
him
a
tray
filled
with
glasses
of
lemonade
and
told
him
to
go
among
the
audience
crying
here
your
nice
cold
lemonade
only
five
cents
a
glass
toby
started
to
do
as
he
was
bidden
but
when
he
tried
to
repeat
the
words
in
anything
like
a
loud
tone
of
voice
they
stuck
in
his
throat
and
he
found
it
next
to
impossible
to
utter
a
sound
above
a
whisper
it
seemed
to
him
that
everyone
in
the
audience
was
looking
only
at
him
and
the
very
sound
of
his
own
voice
made
him
afraid
he
went
entirely
around
the
tent
once
without
making
a
sale
and
when
he
returned
to
the
stand
he
was
at
once
convinced
that
one
of
his
masters
was
quite
as
bad
as
the
other
this
one
and
he
knew
that
his
name
was
jacobs
for
he
heard
someone
call
him
so
very
kindly
told
him
that
he
would
break
every
bone
in
his
body
if
he
did
sell
something
and
toby
confidently
believed
that
he
would
carry
out
his
threat
it
was
with
a
very
heavy
heart
that
he
started
around
again
in
obedience
to
jacobs
angry
command
but
this
time
he
did
manage
to
cry
out
in
a
very
thin
and
very
squeaky
voice
the
words
which
he
had
been
told
to
repeat
this
time
perhaps
owing
to
his
pitiful
and
imploring
look
certainly
not
because
of
the
noise
he
made
he
met
with
very
good
luck
and
sold
every
glass
of
the
mixture
which
lord
and
jacobs
called
lemonade
and
went
back
to
the
stand
for
more
he
certainly
thought
he
had
earned
a
word
of
praise
and
fully
expected
it
as
he
put
the
empty
glasses
and
money
on
the
stand
in
front
of
jacobs
but
instead
of
the
kind
words
he
was
greeted
with
a
volley
of
curses
and
the
reason
for
it
was
that
he
had
taken
in
payment
for
two
of
the
glasses
a
lead
ten
cent
piece
jacobs
after
scolding
poor
little
toby
to
his
heart
content
vowed
that
the
amount
should
be
kept
from
his
first
week
wages
and
then
handed
back
the
coin
with
orders
to
give
it
to
the
first
man
who
gave
him
money
to
change
under
the
penalty
of
a
severe
flogging
if
he
failed
to
do
so
poor
toby
tried
to
explain
matters
by
saying
you
see
i
do
know
anything
about
money
i
never
had
more
a
cent
at
a
time
an
you
must
expect
me
to
get
posted
all
at
i
post
you
with
a
stick
if
you
do
it
again
an
it
wo
be
well
for
you
if
you
bring
that
ten
cent
piece
back
here
now
toby
was
very
well
aware
that
to
pass
the
coin
knowing
it
to
be
bad
would
be
a
crime
and
be
resolved
to
take
the
consequences
of
which
jacobs
had
intimated
if
he
could
not
find
the
one
who
had
given
him
the
counterfeit
and
persuade
him
to
give
him
good
money
in
its
stead
he
remembered
very
plainly
where
he
had
sold
each
glass
of
lemonade
and
he
retraced
his
steps
glancing
at
each
face
carefully
as
he
passed
at
last
he
was
confident
that
he
saw
the
man
who
had
gotten
him
into
such
trouble
and
he
climbed
up
the
board
seats
saying
as
he
stood
in
front
of
him
and
held
out
the
coin
mister
this
money
that
you
gave
me
is
bad
wo
you
give
me
another
one
for
it
the
man
was
a
rough
looking
party
who
had
taken
his
girl
to
the
circus
and
who
did
not
seem
at
all
disposed
to
pay
any
heed
to
toby
request
therefore
he
repeated
it
and
this
time
more
loudly
get
out
the
way
said
the
man
angrily
how
can
you
expect
me
to
see
the
show
if
you
stand
right
in
front
of
me
you
like
it
better
said
toby
earnestly
if
you
give
me
another
ten
cent
get
out
an
do
bother
me
was
the
angry
rejoinder
and
the
little
fellow
began
to
think
that
perhaps
he
would
be
obliged
to
get
out
without
getting
his
money
it
was
becoming
a
desperate
case
for
the
man
was
growing
angry
very
fast
and
if
toby
did
not
succeed
in
getting
good
money
for
the
bad
he
would
have
to
take
the
consequences
of
which
jacobs
had
spoken
please
mister
he
said
imploringly
for
his
heart
began
to
grow
very
heavy
and
he
was
fearing
that
he
should
not
succeed
wo
you
please
give
me
the
money
back
you
know
you
gave
it
to
me
an
i
have
to
pay
it
if
you
the
boy
lip
was
quivering
and
those
around
began
to
be
interested
in
the
affair
while
several
in
the
immediate
vicinity
gave
vent
to
their
indignation
that
a
man
should
try
to
cheat
a
boy
out
of
ten
cents
by
giving
him
counterfeit
money
the
man
whom
toby
was
speaking
to
was
about
to
dismiss
him
with
an
angry
reply
when
he
saw
that
those
about
him
were
not
only
interested
in
the
matter
but
were
evidently
taking
sides
with
the
boy
against
him
and
knowing
well
that
he
had
given
the
counterfeit
money
he
took
another
coin
from
his
pocket
and
handing
it
to
toby
said
i
did
give
you
the
lead
piece
but
you
making
such
a
fuss
about
it
that
here
ten
cents
to
make
you
keep
i
sure
you
did
give
me
the
money
said
toby
as
he
took
the
extended
coin
an
i
much
obliged
to
you
for
takin
it
back
i
did
want
to
tell
you
before
you
thought
i
was
beggin
but
if
you
given
me
this
i
i
have
got
an
awful
whippin
for
jacobs
said
he
fix
me
if
i
did
get
the
money
for
the
man
looked
sheepish
enough
as
he
put
the
bad
money
in
his
pocket
and
toby
innocently
told
story
caused
such
a
feeling
in
his
behalf
among
those
who
sat
near
that
he
not
only
disposed
of
his
entire
stock
then
and
there
but
received
from
one
gentleman
cents
for
himself
he
was
both
proud
and
happy
as
he
returned
to
jacobs
with
empty
glasses
and
with
the
money
to
refund
the
amount
of
loss
which
would
have
been
caused
by
the
counterfeit
but
the
worthy
partner
of
lord
candy
business
had
no
words
of
encouragement
for
the
boy
who
was
trying
so
hard
to
please
let
that
make
you
keep
your
eyes
open
he
growled
out
sulkily
if
you
get
caught
in
that
trap
again
you
wo
be
let
off
so
poor
little
toby
his
heart
seemed
ready
to
break
but
his
few
previous
experience
had
taught
him
that
there
was
but
one
thing
to
do
and
that
was
to
work
just
as
hard
as
possible
trusting
to
some
good
fortune
to
enable
him
to
get
out
of
the
very
disagreeable
position
in
which
he
had
voluntarily
placed
himself
he
took
the
basket
of
candy
that
jacobs
handed
him
and
trudged
around
the
circle
of
seats
selling
far
more
because
of
the
pitifulness
of
his
face
than
because
of
the
excellence
of
his
goods
and
even
this
worked
to
his
disadvantage
jacobs
was
keen
enough
to
see
why
his
little
clerk
sold
so
many
goods
and
each
time
that
he
returned
to
the
stand
he
said
something
to
him
in
an
angry
tone
which
had
the
effect
of
deepening
the
shadow
on
the
boy
face
and
at
the
same
time
increasing
trade
by
the
time
the
performance
was
over
toby
had
in
his
pocket
a
dollar
and
cents
which
had
been
given
him
for
himself
by
some
of
the
kind
hearted
in
the
audience
and
he
kept
his
hand
almost
constantly
upon
it
for
the
money
seemed
to
him
like
some
kind
friend
who
would
help
him
out
of
his
present
difficulties
after
the
audience
had
dispersed
jacobs
set
toby
at
work
washing
the
glasses
and
clearing
up
generally
and
then
the
boy
started
toward
the
other
portion
of
the
store
that
watched
over
by
lord
not
a
person
save
the
watchman
was
in
the
tent
and
as
toby
went
toward
the
door
he
saw
his
friend
the
monkey
sitting
in
one
corner
of
the
cage
and
apparently
watching
his
every
movement
it
was
as
if
he
had
suddenly
seen
one
of
the
boys
from
home
and
toby
uttering
an
exclamation
of
delight
ran
up
to
the
cage
and
put
his
hand
through
the
wires
the
monkey
in
the
gravest
possible
manner
took
one
of
the
fingers
in
his
paw
and
toby
shook
hands
with
him
very
earnestly
i
was
sorry
that
i
could
speak
to
you
when
i
went
in
this
noon
said
toby
as
if
making
an
apology
but
you
see
there
were
so
many
around
here
to
see
you
that
i
could
get
the
chance
did
you
see
me
wink
at
you
the
monkey
made
no
reply
but
he
twisted
his
face
into
such
a
funny
little
grimace
that
toby
was
quite
as
well
satisfied
as
if
he
had
spoken
i
wonder
if
you
hai
some
relation
to
steve
stubbs
toby
continued
earnestly
for
you
look
just
like
him
only
he
do
have
quite
so
many
whiskers
what
i
wanted
to
say
was
that
i
awful
sorry
i
run
away
i
used
to
think
that
uncle
was
bad
enough
but
he
was
just
a
perfect
good
samarathon
to
what
lord
an
jacobs
are
an
when
lord
looks
at
me
with
that
crooked
eye
of
his
i
feel
it
down
in
my
boots
do
you
know
and
here
toby
put
his
mouth
nearer
to
the
head
and
whispered
i
run
away
from
this
circus
if
i
could
get
the
chance
would
you
just
at
this
point
as
if
in
answer
to
the
question
the
monkey
stood
up
on
his
hind
feet
and
reached
out
his
paw
to
the
boy
who
seemed
to
think
this
was
his
way
of
being
more
emphatic
in
saying
toby
took
the
paw
in
his
hand
shook
it
again
earnestly
and
said
as
he
released
it
i
was
pretty
sure
you
felt
just
about
the
same
way
i
did
stubbs
when
i
passed
you
this
noon
look
here
and
toby
took
the
money
from
his
pocket
which
had
been
given
him
i
got
all
that
this
afternoon
an
i
try
an
stick
it
out
somehow
till
i
get
as
much
as
ten
dollars
an
then
we
run
away
some
night
an
go
off
as
far
as
as
as
out
west
an
we
stay
there
the
monkey
probably
tired
with
remaining
in
one
position
so
long
started
toward
the
top
of
the
cage
chattering
and
screaming
joining
the
other
monkeys
who
had
gathered
in
a
little
group
in
one
of
the
swings
now
see
here
stubbs
said
toby
in
alarm
you
must
go
to
telling
everybody
about
it
or
lord
will
know
an
then
we
be
dished
the
monkey
sat
quietly
in
the
swing
as
if
he
felt
reproved
by
what
the
boy
had
said
and
toby
considerably
relieved
by
his
silence
said
as
he
started
toward
the
door
that
right
mum
the
word
you
keep
quiet
an
so
will
i
an
pretty
soon
we
get
away
from
the
whole
all
the
monkeys
chattered
and
toby
believing
that
everything
which
he
had
said
had
been
understood
by
the
animals
went
out
of
the
door
to
meet
his
other
taskmaster
vi
a
tender
hearted
skeleton
now
then
lazybones
was
lord
warning
cry
as
toby
came
out
of
the
tent
if
you
fooled
away
enough
of
your
time
you
can
come
here
an
tend
shop
for
me
while
i
go
to
supper
you
crammed
yourself
this
noon
an
it
teach
you
a
good
lesson
to
make
you
go
without
anything
to
eat
tonight
it
make
you
move
round
more
lively
in
instead
of
becoming
accustomed
to
such
treatment
as
he
was
receiving
from
his
employers
toby
heart
grew
more
tender
with
each
brutal
word
and
this
last
punishment
that
of
losing
his
supper
caused
the
poor
boy
more
sorrow
than
blows
would
lord
started
for
the
hotel
as
he
concluded
his
cruel
speech
and
poor
little
toby
going
behind
the
counter
leaned
his
head
upon
the
rough
boards
and
cried
as
if
his
heart
would
break
all
the
fancied
brightness
and
pleasure
of
a
circus
life
had
vanished
and
in
its
place
was
the
bitterness
of
remorse
that
he
had
repaid
uncle
daniel
kindness
by
the
ingratitude
of
running
away
toby
thought
that
if
he
could
only
nestle
his
little
red
head
on
the
pillows
of
his
little
bed
in
that
rough
room
at
uncle
daniel
he
would
be
the
happiest
and
best
boy
in
the
future
in
all
the
great
wide
world
while
he
was
still
sobbing
away
at
a
most
furious
rate
he
heard
a
voice
close
at
his
elbow
and
looking
up
saw
the
thinnest
man
he
had
ever
seen
in
all
his
life
the
man
had
flesh
colored
tights
on
and
a
spangled
red
velvet
garment
that
was
neither
pants
because
there
were
no
legs
to
it
nor
a
coat
because
it
did
not
come
above
his
waist
made
up
the
remainder
of
his
costume
because
he
was
so
wonderfully
thin
because
of
the
costume
which
he
wore
and
because
of
a
highly
colored
painting
which
was
hanging
in
front
of
one
of
the
small
tents
toby
knew
that
the
living
skeleton
was
before
him
and
his
big
brown
eyes
opened
all
the
wider
as
he
gazed
at
him
what
is
the
matter
little
fellow
asked
the
man
in
a
kindly
tone
what
makes
you
cry
so
has
job
been
up
to
his
old
tricks
again
i
do
know
what
his
old
tricks
are
and
toby
sobbed
the
tears
coming
again
because
of
the
sympathy
which
this
man
voice
expressed
for
him
but
i
know
that
he
a
mean
ugly
thing
that
what
i
know
an
if
i
could
only
get
back
to
uncle
there
hai
elephants
enough
in
all
the
circuses
in
the
world
to
pull
me
away
oh
you
run
away
from
home
did
you
yes
i
did
sobbed
toby
an
there
hai
any
boy
in
any
sunday
school
book
that
ever
i
read
that
was
half
so
sorry

bad
as
i
am
it
awful
an
now
i
ca
have
any
supper
i
stopped
to

in

private
chair

the
skeleton
but

his
name

only

him
so
he
looks
so
much
like
a
feller
i
know
who

satisfied
the
skeleton
that
this
stubbs
must
be
someone
attached
to
the
show
and
he
asked
has

been
whipping
you
no
ben
the
driver
on
the
wagon
where

he
hai
going
to
let
me
have
any
supper
i
was
so
slow
about
my
work
though
i
was
slow
i
only
talked
to
stubbs
when
there
was
anybody
round
his
sam
sam
this
name
which
was
shouted
twice
in
a
quick
loud
voice
and
the
third
time
in
a
slow
manner
ending
almost
in
a
screech
did
not
come
from
either
toby
or
the
skeleton
but
from
an
enormously
large
woman
dressed
in
a
gaudy
red
and
black
dress
cut
very
short
and
with
low
neck
and
an
apology
for
sleeves
who
had
just
come
out
from
the
tent
whereon
the
picture
of
the
living
skeleton
hung
samuel
she
screamed
again

death

i
shall
have

wheezin
around
with
the
phthisic
all
night
come
in
that
her
said
the
skeleton
to
toby
as
he
pointed
his
thumb
in
the
direction
of
the
fat
woman
but
paying
no
attention
to
the
outcry
she
was
making
that
my
wife
lilly
an
she
the
fat
woman
of
the
show
she
always
yellin
after
me
that
way
the
minute
i

out
for
a
little
fresh
air
an
she
always
sayin
just
the

thing

an
i

large
she
ca

all
over
her
an
thinks
it
me
that
has
is
is
all
that
is
that
your
wife
stammered
toby
in
astonishment
as
he
looked
at
the
enormously
fat
woman
who
stood
in
the
tent
door
and
then
at
the
wonderfully
thin
man
who
sat
beside
him
yes
that
her
said
the
skeleton
she
weighs
pretty
nigh
four
hundred
though
of
course
the
show
cards
says
it
over
six
hundred
she
earns
almost
as
much
money
as
i
do
of
course
she
ca
get
so
much
for
skeletons
is
much
scarcer
than
fat
folks
but
we
make
a
pretty
good
thing
travelin
again
came
the
cry
from
the
fat
woman
are
you
never
coming
in
not
yet
my
angel
said
the
skeleton
placidly
as
he
crossed
one
thin
leg
over
the
other
and
looked
calmly
at
her
come
here
an
see
new
your
imprudence
is
wearin
me
away
so
that
i
be
worth
five
dollars
a
week
to
any
circus
she
said
impatiently
at
the
same
time
coming
toward
the
candy
stand
quite
as
rapidly
as
her
very
great
size
would
admit
this
is
my
wife
lilly
treat
said
the
skeleton
with
a
proud
wave
of
his
hand
as
he
rose
from
his
seat
and
gazed
admiringly
at
her
this
is
my
flower
my
queen
tyler
said
toby
supplying
the
name
which
the
skeleton
or
mr
treat
as
toby
now
learned
his
name
was
did
not
know
tyler
is
my
name
toby
why
what
a
little
chap
you
are
said
mrs
treat
paying
no
attention
to
the
awkward
little
bend
of
the
head
which
toby
intended
for
a
bow
how
small
he
is
samuel
yes
said
the
skeleton
reflectively
as
he
looked
toby
over
from
head
to
foot
as
if
he
were
mentally
trying
to
calculate
exactly
how
many
inches
high
he
was
he
is
small
but
he
got
all
the
world
before
him
to
grow
in
an
if
he
only
eats
enough
there
that
reminds
me
job
is
going
to
give
him
any
supper
because
he
did
work
hard
he
wo
wo
he
exclaimed
the
large
lady
savagely
oh
he
a
precious
one
he
is
an
some
day
i
shall
just
give
him
a
good
up
that
what
i
do
i
get
all
out
of
patience
with
that
an
she
do
just
what
she
says
said
the
skeleton
to
toby
with
an
admiring
shake
of
the
head
that
woman
hai
afraid
of
anybody
an
i
would
be
a
bit
surprised
if
she
did
give
job
a
pretty
rough
toby
thought
as
he
looked
at
her
that
she
was
large
enough
to
give
anyone
a
pretty
rough
time
but
he
did
not
venture
to
say
so
while
he
was
looking
first
at
her
and
then
at
her
very
thin
husband
the
skeleton
told
his
wife
the
little
that
he
had
learned
regarding
the
boy
history
and
when
he
had
concluded
she
waddled
away
toward
her
tent
great
woman
that
said
the
skeleton
as
he
saw
her
disappear
within
the
tent
yes
said
toby
she
the
greatest
i
ever
i
mean
that
she
got
a
great
head
now
you
see
about
how
much
she
cares
for
what
job
if
i
was
as
big
as
her
said
toby
with
just
a
shade
of
envy
in
his
voice
i
would
be
afraid
of
it
hai
so
much
the
size
said
the
skeleton
sagely
it
hai
so
much
the
size
my
boy
for
i
can
scare
that
woman
almost
to
death
when
i
feel
like
toby
looked
for
a
moment
at
mr
treat
thin
legs
and
arms
and
then
he
said
warningly
i
would
feel
like
it
very
often
if
i
was
you
mr
treat
she
might
break
some
of
your
bones
if
you
did
happen
to
scare
her
do
fear
for
me
my
boy
do
fear
for
me
you
see
how
i
manage
her
if
you
stay
with
the
circus
long
enough
now
i
often
if
mr
treat
was
about
to
confide
a
family
secret
to
toby
it
was
fated
that
he
should
not
hear
it
then
for
mrs
treat
had
just
come
out
of
her
tent
carrying
in
her
hands
a
large
tin
plate
piled
high
with
a
miscellaneous
assortment
of
pie
cake
bread
and
meat
she
placed
this
in
front
of
toby
and
as
she
did
so
she
handed
him
two
pictures
there
little
toby
tyler
she
said
there
something
for
you
to
eat
if
job
lord
and
his
precious
partner
jacobs
did
say
you
have
any
supper
an
i
brought
you
a
picture
of
samuel
an
me
we
sell
for
ten
cents
apiece
but
i
going
to
give
them
to
you
because
i
like
the
looks
of
toby
was
quite
overcome
with
the
presents
and
seemed
at
a
loss
how
to
thank
her
for
them
he
attempted
to
speak
but
could
not
get
the
words
out
at
first
and
then
he
said
as
he
put
the
two
photographs
in
the
same
pocket
with
his
money
you
awful
good
to
me
an
when
i
get
to
be
a
man
i
give
you
lots
of
things
i
was
so
very
hungry
if
i
am
such
a
big
eater
but
i
did
want
bless
your
dear
little
heart
and
you
shall
have
something
to
eat
said
the
fat
woman
as
she
seized
toby
squeezed
him
close
up
to
her
and
kissed
his
freckled
face
as
kindly
as
if
it
had
been
as
fair
and
white
as
possible
you
shall
eat
all
you
want
to
an
if
you
get
the
stomachache
as
samuel
does
sometimes
when
he
been
eatin
too
much
i
give
you
some
catnip
tea
out
of
the
same
dipper
that
i
give
him
his
he
a
great
eater
samuel
is
she
added
in
a
burst
of
confidence
an
it
a
wonder
to
me
what
he
does
with
it
all
is
he
exclaimed
toby
quickly
how
funny
that
is
for
i
an
awful
eater
why
uncle
used
to
say
that
i
ate
twice
as
much
as
i
ought
to
an
it
never
made
me
any
bigger
i
wonder
what
the
reason
i
declare
i
do
know
said
the
fat
woman
thoughtfully
an
wondered
at
it
time
an
time
again
some
folks
is
made
that
way
some
folks
is
made
different
now
i
do
eat
enough
to
keep
a
chicken
alive
an
yet
i
grow
fatter
an
fatter
every
day
do
i
samuel
indeed
you
do
my
love
said
the
skeleton
with
a
world
of
pride
in
his
voice
but
you
must
feel
bad
about
it
for
every
pound
you
gain
makes
you
worth
just
so
much
more
to
the
oh
i
was
worryin
i
was
only
wonderin
but
we
must
go
samuel
for
the
poor
child
wo
eat
a
bit
while
we
are
here
after
you
eaten
what
there
is
there
bring
the
plate
in
to
me
she
said
to
toby
as
she
took
her
lean
husband
by
the
arm
and
walked
him
off
toward
their
own
tent
toby
gazed
after
them
a
moment
and
then
he
commenced
a
vigorous
attack
upon
the
eatables
which
had
been
so
kindly
given
him
of
the
food
which
he
had
taken
from
the
dinner
table
he
had
eaten
some
while
he
was
in
the
tent
and
after
that
he
had
entirely
forgotten
that
he
had
any
in
his
pocket
therefore
at
the
time
that
mrs
treat
had
brought
him
such
a
liberal
supply
he
was
really
very
hungry
he
succeeded
in
eating
nearly
all
the
food
which
had
been
brought
to
him
and
the
very
small
quantity
which
remained
he
readily
found
room
for
in
his
pockets
then
he
washed
the
plate
nicely
and
seeing
no
one
in
sight
he
thought
he
could
leave
the
booth
long
enough
to
return
the
plate
he
ran
with
it
quickly
into
the
tent
occupied
by
the
thin
man
and
fat
woman
and
handed
it
to
her
with
a
profusion
of
thanks
for
her
kindness
did
you
eat
it
all
she
asked
well
hesitated
toby
there
was
two
doughnuts
an
a
piece
of
pie
left
over
an
i
put
them
in
my
pocket
if
you
do
care
i
eat
them
some
time
you
shall
eat
it
whenever
you
want
to
an
any
time
that
you
get
hungry
again
you
come
right
to
thank
you
marm
i
must
go
now
for
i
left
the
store
all
run
then
an
if
job
abuses
you
just
let
me
know
it
an
i
keep
him
from
cuttin
up
any
toby
hardly
heard
the
end
of
her
sentence
so
great
was
his
haste
to
get
back
to
the
booth
and
just
as
he
emerged
from
the
tent
on
a
quick
run
he
received
a
blow
on
the
ear
which
sent
him
sprawling
in
the
dust
and
he
heard
job
lord
angry
voice
as
it
said
so
just
the
moment
my
back
is
turned
you
leave
the
stand
to
take
care
of
itself
do
you
an
run
around
tryin
to
plot
some
mischief
against
me
eh
and
the
brute
kicked
the
prostrate
boy
twice
with
his
heavy
boot
please
do
kick
me
again
pleaded
toby
i
was
gone
but
a
minute
an
i
was
doing
anything
you
lying
now
an
you
know
it
you
young
cub
exclaimed
the
angry
man
as
he
advanced
to
kick
the
boy
again
i
let
you
know
who
got
to
deal
with
when
you
get
hold
of
me
and
i
let
you
know
who
you
got
to
deal
with
when
you
get
hold
of
me
said
a
woman
voice
and
just
as
lord
raised
his
foot
to
kick
the
boy
again
the
fat
woman
seized
him
by
the
collar
jerked
him
back
over
one
of
the
tent
ropes
and
left
him
quite
as
prostrate
as
he
had
left
toby
now
job
lord
said
the
angry
woman
as
she
towered
above
the
thoroughly
enraged
but
thoroughly
frightened
man
i
want
you
to
understand
that
you
ca
knock
and
beat
this
boy
while
i
around
seen
enough
of
your
capers
an
i
going
to
put
a
stop
to
them
that
boy
was
in
this
tent
more
than
two
minutes
an
he
attends
to
his
work
better
than
anyone
you
have
ever
had
so
see
that
you
treat
him
decent
get
up
she
said
to
toby
who
had
not
dared
to
rise
from
the
ground
and
if
he
offers
to
strike
you
again
come
to
toby
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
ran
to
the
booth
in
time
to
attend
to
one
or
two
customers
who
had
just
come
up
he
could
see
from
out
the
corner
of
his
eye
that
lord
had
arisen
to
his
feet
also
and
was
engaged
in
an
angry
conversation
with
mrs
treat
the
result
of
which
he
very
much
feared
would
be
another
and
a
worse
whipping
for
him
but
in
this
he
was
mistaken
for
lord
after
the
conversation
was
ended
came
toward
the
booth
and
began
to
attend
to
his
business
without
speaking
one
word
to
toby
when
jacobs
returned
from
his
supper
lord
took
him
by
the
arm
and
walked
him
out
toward
the
rear
of
the
tents
and
tony
was
very
positive
that
he
was
to
be
the
subject
of
their
conversation
which
made
him
not
a
little
uneasy
it
was
not
until
nearly
time
for
the
performance
to
begin
that
lord
returned
and
he
had
nothing
to
say
to
toby
save
to
tell
him
to
go
into
the
tent
and
begin
his
work
there
the
boy
was
only
too
glad
to
escape
so
easily
and
he
went
to
his
work
with
as
much
alacrity
as
if
he
were
about
entering
upon
some
pleasure
when
he
met
jacobs
that
gentleman
spoke
to
him
very
sharply
about
being
late
and
seemed
to
think
it
no
excuse
at
all
that
he
had
just
been
relieved
from
the
outside
work
by
lord
vii
an
accident
and
its
consequences
toby
experience
in
the
evening
was
very
similar
to
that
of
the
afternoon
save
that
he
was
so
fortunate
as
not
to
take
any
more
bad
money
in
payment
for
his
goods
jacobs
scolded
and
swore
alternately
and
the
boy
really
surprised
him
by
his
way
of
selling
goods
though
he
was
very
careful
not
to
say
anything
about
it
but
made
toby
believe
that
he
was
doing
only
about
half
as
much
work
as
he
ought
to
do
toby
private
hoard
of
money
was
increased
that
evening
by
presents
ninety
cents
and
he
began
to
look
upon
himself
as
almost
a
rich
man
when
the
performance
was
nearly
over
jacobs
called
to
him
to
help
in
packing
up
and
by
the
time
the
last
spectator
had
left
the
tent
the
worldly
possessions
of
lord
and
jacobs
were
ready
for
removal
and
toby
allowed
to
do
as
he
had
a
mind
to
so
long
as
he
was
careful
to
be
on
hand
when
old
ben
was
ready
to
start
toby
thought
that
he
would
have
time
to
pay
a
visit
to
his
friends
the
skeleton
and
the
fat
woman
and
to
that
end
started
toward
the
place
where
their
tent
had
been
standing
but
to
his
sorrow
he
found
that
it
was
already
being
taken
down
and
he
had
only
time
to
thank
mrs
treat
and
to
press
the
fleshless
hand
of
her
shadowy
husband
as
they
entered
their
wagon
to
drive
away
he
was
disappointed
for
he
had
hoped
to
be
able
to
speak
with
his
new
made
friends
a
few
moments
before
the
weary
night
ride
commenced
but
failing
in
that
he
went
hastily
back
to
the
monkeys
cage
old
ben
was
there
getting
things
ready
for
a
start
but
the
wooden
sides
of
the
cage
had
not
been
put
up
and
toby
had
no
difficulty
in
calling
the
aged
monkey
up
to
the
bars
he
held
one
of
the
fat
woman
doughnuts
in
his
hand
and
said
as
he
passed
it
through
to
the
animal
i
thought
perhaps
you
might
be
hungry
stubbs
and
this
is
some
of
what
the
skeleton
wife
gave
me
i
hai
got
very
much
time
to
talk
with
you
now
but
the
first
chance
i
can
get
away
tomorrow
an
when
there
hai
anybody
round
i
want
to
tell
you
the
monkey
had
taken
the
doughnut
in
his
handlike
paws
and
was
tearing
it
to
pieces
eating
small
portions
of
it
very
rapidly
do
hurry
yourself
said
toby
warningly
for
uncle
always
told
me
the
worst
thing
a
feller
could
do
was
to
eat
fast
if
you
want
any
more
after
we
start
just
put
your
hand
through
the
little
hole
up
there
near
the
seat
an
i
give
you
all
you
from
the
look
on
his
face
toby
confidently
believed
the
monkey
was
about
to
make
some
reply
but
just
then
ben
shut
up
the
sides
separating
toby
and
stubbs
and
the
order
was
given
to
start
toby
clambered
up
on
to
the
high
seat
ben
followed
him
and
in
another
instant
the
team
was
moving
along
slowly
down
the
dusty
road
preceded
and
followed
by
the
many
wagons
with
their
tiny
swinging
lights
well
said
ben
when
he
had
got
his
team
well
under
way
and
felt
that
he
could
indulge
in
a
little
conversation
how
did
you
get
along
today
toby
related
all
of
his
movements
and
gave
the
driver
a
faithful
account
of
all
that
had
happened
to
him
concluding
his
story
by
saying
that
was
one
of
mrs
treat
doughnuts
that
i
just
gave
to
to
whom
asked
ben
in
surprise
to
stubbs
the
old
fellow
here
in
the
cart
you
know
that
been
so
good
to
toby
heard
a
sort
of
gurgling
sound
saw
the
driver
body
sway
back
and
forth
in
a
trembling
way
and
was
just
becoming
thoroughly
alarmed
when
he
thought
of
the
previous
night
and
understood
that
ben
was
only
laughing
in
his
own
peculiar
way
how
did
you
know
his
name
was
stubbs
asked
ben
after
he
had
recovered
his
breath
oh
i
do
know
that
that
is
his
real
name
was
the
quick
reply
i
only
call
him
that
because
he
looks
so
much
like
a
feller
with
that
name
that
i
knew
at
home
he
do
seem
to
mind
because
i
call
him
ben
looked
at
toby
earnestly
for
a
moment
acting
all
the
time
as
if
he
wanted
to
laugh
again
but
did
dare
to
for
fear
he
might
burst
a
blood
vessel
and
then
he
said
as
he
patted
him
on
the
shoulder
well
you
are
the
queerest
little
fish
that
i
ever
saw
in
all
my
travels
you
seem
to
think
that
that
monkey
knows
all
you
say
to
i
sure
he
does
said
toby
positively
he
do
say
anything
right
out
to
me
but
he
knows
everything
i
tell
him
do
you
suppose
he
could
talk
if
he
tried
to
look
here
toby
tyler
and
ben
turned
half
around
in
his
seat
and
looked
toby
full
in
the
face
so
as
to
give
more
emphasis
to
his
words
are
you
heathen
enough
to
think
that
that
monkey
could
talk
if
he
wanted
to
i
know
i
hai
a
heathen
said
toby
thoughtfully
for
if
i
had
been
some
of
the
missionaries
would
have
found
me
out
a
good
while
ago
but
i
never
saw
anybody
like
this
old
stubbs
before
an
i
thought
he
could
talk
if
he
wanted
to
just
as
the
living
skeleton
does
or
his
wife
anyhow
stubbs
winked
at
me
an
how
could
he
do
that
if
he
did
know
what
i
been
sayin
to
him
look
here
my
son
said
ben
in
a
most
fatherly
fashion
monkeys
hai
anything
but
beasts
an
they
do
know
how
to
talk
any
more
than
they
know
what
you
say
to
did
you
ever
hear
any
of
them
speak
a
word
never
i
been
in
a
circus
man
an
boy
nigh
on
to
forty
years
i
never
seen
nothin
in
a
monkey
more
any
other
beast
except
their
awful
well
said
toby
still
unconvinced
i
believe
stubbs
knows
what
i
say
to
him
now
do
be
foolish
toby
pleaded
ben
you
ca
show
me
one
thing
that
a
monkey
ever
did
because
you
told
him
just
at
this
moment
toby
felt
someone
pulling
at
the
back
of
his
coat
and
looking
round
he
saw
it
was
a
little
brown
hand
reaching
through
the
bars
of
the
air
hole
of
the
cage
that
was
tugging
away
at
his
coat
there
he
said
triumphantly
to
ben
look
there
i
told
stubbs
if
he
wanted
anything
more
to
eat
to
tell
me
an
i
would
give
it
to
him
now
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
he
come
for
and
toby
took
a
doughnut
from
his
pocket
and
put
it
into
the
tiny
hand
which
was
immediately
withdrawn
now
what
do
you
think
of
stubbs
knowing
what
i
say
to
him
they
often
stick
their
paws
up
through
there
said
ben
in
a
matter
of
fact
tone
i
had
pull
my
coat
in
the
night
till
they
made
me
as
nervous
as
ever
any
old
woman
was
you
see
toby
my
boy
monkeys
is
monkeys
an
you
must
go
to
gettin
the
idea
that
they
anything
else
for
it
a
mistake
you
think
this
old
monkey
in
here
knows
what
you
say
why
that
just
the
cuteness
of
the
old
fellow
he
watches
you
to
see
if
he
ca
do
just
as
you
do
an
that
all
there
is
about
toby
was
more
than
half
convinced
that
ben
was
putting
the
matter
in
its
proper
light
and
he
would
have
believed
all
that
had
been
said
if
just
at
that
moment
he
had
not
seen
that
brown
hand
reaching
through
the
hole
to
clutch
him
again
by
the
coat
the
action
seemed
so
natural
so
like
a
hungry
boy
who
gropes
in
the
dark
pantry
for
something
to
eat
that
it
would
have
taken
more
arguments
than
ben
had
at
his
disposal
to
persuade
toby
that
his
stubbs
could
not
understand
all
that
was
said
to
him
toby
put
another
doughnut
in
the
outstretched
hand
and
then
sat
silently
as
if
in
a
brown
study
over
some
difficult
problem
for
some
time
the
ride
was
continued
in
silence
ben
was
going
through
all
the
motions
of
whistling
without
uttering
a
sound
a
favorite
amusement
of
his
and
toby
thoughts
were
far
away
in
the
humble
home
he
had
scorned
with
uncle
daniel
whose
virtues
had
increased
in
his
esteem
with
every
mile
of
distance
which
had
been
put
between
them
and
whose
faults
had
decreased
in
a
corresponding
ratio
toby
thoughtfulness
had
made
him
sleepy
and
his
eyes
were
almost
closed
in
slumber
when
he
was
startled
by
a
crashing
sound
was
conscious
of
a
feeling
of
being
hurled
from
his
seat
by
some
great
force
and
then
he
lay
senseless
by
the
side
of
the
road
while
the
wagon
became
a
perfect
wreck
from
out
of
which
a
small
army
of
monkeys
was
escaping
ben
experienced
ear
had
told
him
at
the
first
crash
that
his
wagon
was
breaking
down
and
without
having
time
to
warn
toby
of
his
peril
he
had
leaped
clear
of
the
wreck
keeping
his
horses
under
perfect
control
and
thus
averting
more
trouble
it
was
the
breaking
of
one
of
the
axles
which
toby
had
heard
just
before
he
was
thrown
from
his
seat
and
when
the
body
of
the
wagon
came
down
upon
the
hard
road
the
monkeys
thus
suddenly
released
from
confinement
had
scampered
off
in
every
direction
and
by
a
singular
chance
toby
aged
friend
started
for
the
woods
in
such
a
direction
as
to
bring
him
directly
before
the
boy
insensible
form
the
monkey
on
coming
up
to
toby
stopped
urged
by
the
well
known
curiosity
of
its
race
and
began
to
examine
the
person
carefully
prying
into
pockets
and
trying
to
open
the
boy
half
closed
eyelids
fortunately
for
toby
he
had
fallen
upon
a
mud
bank
and
was
only
stunned
for
the
moment
having
received
no
serious
bruises
the
attentions
bestowed
upon
him
by
the
monkey
served
the
purpose
of
bringing
him
to
his
senses
and
after
he
had
looked
around
him
in
the
gray
light
of
the
coming
morning
it
would
have
taken
far
more
of
a
philosopher
than
old
ben
was
to
persuade
the
boy
that
monkeys
did
not
possess
reasoning
faculties
the
monkey
was
busy
at
toby
ears
nose
and
mouth
as
monkeys
will
do
when
they
get
an
opportunity
and
the
expression
of
its
face
was
as
grave
as
possible
toby
firmly
believed
that
the
monkey
face
showed
sorrow
at
his
fall
and
he
imagined
that
the
attentions
which
were
bestowed
upon
him
were
for
the
purpose
of
learning
whether
he
had
been
injured
or
not
do
worry
stubbs
said
toby
anxious
to
reassure
his
friend
as
he
sat
upright
and
looked
about
him
i
did
get
hurt
any
but
i
would
like
to
know
how
i
got
way
over
it
really
seemed
as
if
the
monkey
was
pleased
to
know
that
his
little
friend
was
not
hurt
for
he
seated
himself
on
his
haunches
and
his
face
expressed
the
liveliest
pleasure
that
toby
was
well
again
or
at
least
that
was
how
the
boy
interpreted
the
look
by
this
time
the
news
of
the
accident
had
been
shouted
ahead
from
one
team
to
the
other
and
all
hands
were
hurrying
to
the
scene
for
the
purpose
of
rendering
aid
as
toby
saw
them
coming
he
also
saw
a
number
of
small
forms
looking
something
like
diminutive
men
hurrying
past
him
and
for
the
first
time
he
understood
how
it
was
that
the
aged
monkey
was
at
liberty
and
knew
that
those
little
dusky
forms
were
the
other
occupants
of
the
cage
escaping
to
the
woods
see
there
stubbs
see
there
he
exclaimed
pointing
toward
the
fugitives
they
all
going
off
into
the
woods
what
shall
we
do
the
sight
of
the
runaways
seemed
to
excite
the
old
monkey
quite
as
much
as
it
did
the
boy
he
sprang
to
his
feet
chattering
in
the
most
excited
way
screamed
two
or
three
times
as
if
he
were
calling
them
back
and
then
started
off
in
vigorous
pursuit
now
he
gone
too
said
toby
disconsolately
believing
the
old
fellow
had
run
away
from
him
i
did
think
stubbs
would
treat
me
this
way
viii
capture
of
the
monkeys
the
boy
tried
to
rise
to
his
feet
but
his
head
whirled
so
and
he
felt
so
dizzy
and
sick
from
the
effects
of
his
fall
that
he
was
obliged
to
sit
down
again
until
he
should
feel
able
to
stand
meanwhile
the
crowd
around
the
wagon
paid
no
attention
to
him
and
he
lay
there
quietly
enough
until
he
heard
the
hateful
voice
of
lord
asking
if
his
boy
were
hurt
the
sound
of
his
voice
affected
toby
very
much
as
the
chills
and
fever
affect
a
sufferer
and
he
shook
so
with
fear
and
his
heart
beat
so
loudly
that
he
thought
lord
must
know
where
he
was
by
the
sound
seeing
however
that
his
employer
did
not
come
directly
toward
him
the
thought
flashed
upon
his
mind
that
now
would
be
a
good
chance
to
run
away
and
he
acted
upon
it
at
once
he
rolled
himself
over
in
the
mud
until
he
reached
a
low
growth
of
fir
trees
that
skirted
the
road
and
when
beneath
their
friendly
shade
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
walked
swiftly
toward
the
woods
following
the
direction
the
monkeys
had
taken
he
no
longer
felt
dizzy
and
sick
the
fear
of
lord
had
dispelled
all
that
and
he
felt
strong
and
active
again
he
had
walked
rapidly
for
some
distance
and
was
nearly
beyond
the
sound
of
the
voices
in
the
road
when
he
was
startled
by
seeing
quite
a
procession
of
figures
emerge
from
the
trees
and
come
directly
toward
him
he
could
not
understand
the
meaning
of
this
strange
company
and
it
so
frightened
him
that
he
attempted
to
hide
behind
a
tree
in
the
hope
that
they
might
pass
without
seeing
him
but
no
sooner
had
he
secreted
himself
than
a
strange
shrill
chattering
came
from
the
foremost
of
the
group
and
in
an
instant
toby
emerged
from
his
place
of
concealment
he
had
recognized
the
peculiar
sound
as
that
of
the
old
monkey
who
had
left
him
a
few
moments
before
and
he
knew
now
what
he
did
not
know
then
owing
to
the
darkness
the
newcomers
were
the
monkeys
that
had
escaped
from
the
cage
and
had
been
overtaken
and
compelled
to
come
back
by
the
old
monkey
who
seemed
to
have
the
most
perfect
control
over
them
the
old
fellow
was
leading
the
band
and
all
were
linked
hand
in
hand
with
each
other
which
gave
the
whole
crowd
a
most
comical
appearance
as
they
came
up
to
toby
half
hopping
half
walking
upright
and
all
chattering
and
screaming
like
a
crowd
of
children
out
for
a
holiday
toby
stepped
toward
the
noisy
crowd
held
out
his
hand
gravely
to
the
old
monkey
and
said
in
tones
of
heartfelt
sorrow
i
felt
awful
bad
because
i
thought
you
had
gone
off
an
left
me
when
you
went
off
to
find
the
other
fellows
you
awful
good
stubbs
an
now
instead
of
runnin
away
as
i
was
goin
to
do
we
all
go
back
the
old
monkey
grasped
toby
extended
hand
with
his
disengaged
paw
and
clinging
firmly
to
it
the
whole
crowd
followed
in
unbroken
line
chattering
and
scolding
at
the
most
furious
rate
while
every
now
and
then
stubbs
would
look
back
and
scream
out
something
which
would
cause
the
confusion
to
cease
for
an
instant
it
was
really
a
comical
sight
but
toby
seemed
to
think
it
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
that
they
should
follow
him
in
this
manner
and
he
chattered
to
the
old
monkey
quite
as
fast
as
any
of
the
others
were
doing
he
told
him
very
gravely
all
that
he
knew
about
the
accident
explained
why
it
was
that
he
conceived
the
idea
of
running
away
and
really
believed
that
stubbs
understood
every
word
he
was
saying
very
shortly
after
toby
had
started
to
run
away
the
proprietor
of
the
circus
drove
up
to
the
scene
of
disaster
and
after
seeing
that
the
wagon
was
being
rapidly
fixed
up
so
that
it
could
be
hauled
to
the
next
town
he
ordered
that
search
should
be
made
for
the
monkeys
it
was
very
important
that
they
should
be
captured
at
once
and
he
appeared
to
think
more
of
the
loss
of
the
animals
than
of
the
damage
done
to
the
wagon
while
the
men
were
forming
a
plan
for
a
search
for
the
truants
so
that
in
case
of
a
capture
they
could
let
one
another
know
the
noise
made
by
toby
and
his
party
was
heard
and
the
men
stood
still
to
learn
what
it
meant
the
entire
party
burst
into
shouts
of
laughter
as
toby
and
his
companions
walked
into
the
circle
of
light
formed
by
the
glare
of
the
lanterns
and
the
merriment
was
by
no
means
abated
at
toby
serious
demeanor
the
wagon
was
now
standing
upright
with
the
door
open
and
toby
therefore
led
his
companions
directly
to
it
gravely
motioning
them
to
enter
the
old
monkey
instead
of
obeying
stepped
back
to
toby
side
and
screamed
to
the
others
in
such
a
manner
that
they
all
entered
the
cage
leaving
him
on
the
outside
with
the
boy
toby
motioned
him
to
get
in
too
but
he
clung
to
his
hand
and
scolded
so
furiously
that
it
was
apparent
he
had
no
idea
of
leaving
his
boy
companion
one
of
the
men
stepped
up
and
was
about
to
force
him
into
the
wagon
when
the
proprietor
ordered
him
to
stop
what
boy
is
that
he
asked
job
lord
new
boy
said
someone
in
the
crowd
the
man
asked
toby
how
it
was
that
he
had
succeeded
in
capturing
all
the
runaways
and
he
answered
gravely
mr
stubbs
an
i
are
good
friends
an
when
he
saw
the
others
away
he
just
stopped
an
brought
back
to
me
i
wish
you
let
stubbs
ride
with
me
we
like
each
other
a
good
you
can
do
just
what
you
please
with
stubbs
as
you
call
him
i
expected
to
lose
half
the
monkeys
in
that
cage
and
you
have
brought
back
every
one
that
monkey
shall
be
yours
and
you
may
put
him
in
the
cage
whenever
you
want
to
or
take
him
with
you
just
as
you
choose
for
he
belongs
entirely
to
toby
joy
knew
no
bounds
he
put
his
arm
around
the
monkey
neck
and
the
monkey
clung
firmly
to
him
until
even
job
lord
was
touched
at
the
evidence
of
affection
between
the
two
while
the
wagon
was
being
repaired
toby
and
the
monkey
stood
hand
in
hand
watching
the
work
go
on
while
those
in
the
cage
scolded
and
raved
because
they
had
been
induced
to
return
to
captivity
after
a
while
the
old
monkey
seated
himself
on
toby
arm
and
cuddled
close
up
to
him
uttering
now
and
then
a
contented
sort
of
a
little
squeak
as
the
boy
talked
to
him
that
night
stubbs
slept
in
toby
arms
in
the
band
wagon
and
both
boy
and
monkey
appeared
very
well
contented
with
their
lot
which
a
short
time
previous
had
seemed
so
hard
when
toby
awakened
to
his
second
day
work
with
the
circus
his
monkey
friend
was
seated
by
his
side
gravely
exploring
his
pockets
and
all
the
boy
treasures
were
being
spread
out
on
the
floor
of
the
wagon
by
his
side
toby
remonstrated
with
him
on
this
breach
of
confidence
but
stubbs
was
more
in
the
mood
for
sport
than
for
grave
conversation
and
the
more
toby
talked
the
more
mischievous
did
he
become
until
at
length
the
boy
gathered
up
his
little
store
of
treasures
took
the
monkey
by
the
paw
and
walked
him
toward
the
cage
from
which
he
had
escaped
on
the
previous
night
now
stubbs
said
toby
speaking
in
an
injured
tone
you
must
go
in
here
and
stay
till
i
have
got
more
time
to
fool
with
he
opened
the
door
of
the
cage
but
the
monkey
struggled
as
well
as
he
was
able
and
toby
was
obliged
to
exert
all
his
strength
to
put
him
in
when
once
the
door
was
fastened
upon
him
toby
tried
to
impress
upon
his
monkey
friend
mind
the
importance
of
being
more
sedate
and
he
was
convinced
that
the
words
had
sunk
deep
into
stubbs
heart
for
by
the
time
he
had
concluded
the
old
monkey
was
seated
in
the
corner
of
the
cage
looking
up
from
under
his
shaggy
eyebrows
in
the
most
reproachful
manner
possible
toby
felt
sorry
that
he
had
spoken
so
harshly
and
was
about
to
make
amends
for
his
severity
when
lord
gruff
voice
recalled
him
to
the
fact
that
his
time
was
not
his
own
and
he
therefore
commenced
his
work
but
with
a
lighter
heart
than
he
had
had
since
he
stole
away
from
uncle
daniel
and
guilford
this
day
was
not
very
much
different
from
the
preceding
one
so
far
as
the
manner
of
lord
and
his
partner
toward
the
boy
was
concerned
they
seemed
to
have
an
idea
that
he
was
doing
only
about
half
as
much
work
as
he
ought
to
and
both
united
in
swearing
at
and
abusing
him
as
much
as
possible
so
far
as
his
relations
with
other
members
of
the
company
were
concerned
toby
now
stood
in
a
much
better
position
than
before
those
who
had
witnessed
the
scene
told
the
others
how
toby
had
led
in
the
monkeys
on
the
night
previous
and
nearly
every
member
of
the
company
had
a
kind
word
for
the
little
fellow
whose
head
could
hardly
be
seen
above
the
counter
of
lord
and
jacobs
booth
ix
the
dinner
party
at
noon
toby
was
thoroughly
tired
out
for
whenever
anyone
spoke
kindly
to
him
lord
seemed
to
take
a
malicious
pleasure
in
giving
him
extra
tasks
to
do
until
toby
began
to
hope
that
no
one
else
would
pay
any
attention
to
him
on
this
day
he
was
permitted
to
go
to
dinner
first
and
after
he
returned
he
was
left
in
charge
of
the
booth
trade
being
dull
as
it
usually
was
during
the
dinner
hour
he
had
very
little
work
to
do
after
he
had
cleaned
the
glasses
and
set
things
to
rights
generally
when
therefore
he
saw
the
gaunt
form
of
the
skeleton
emerge
from
his
tent
and
come
toward
him
he
was
particularly
pleased
for
he
had
begun
to
think
very
kindly
of
the
thin
man
and
his
fleshy
wife
well
toby
said
the
skeleton
as
he
came
up
to
the
booth
carefully
dusted
lord
private
chair
and
sat
down
very
cautiously
in
it
as
if
he
expected
that
it
would
break
down
under
his
weight
i
hear
been
making
quite
a
hero
of
yourself
by
capturing
the
monkeys
last
toby
freckled
face
reddened
with
pleasure
as
he
heard
these
words
and
he
stammered
out
with
considerable
difficulty
i
did
do
anything
it
was
stubbs
that
brought
mr
stubbs
and
the
skeleton
laughed
so
heartily
that
toby
was
afraid
he
would
dislocate
some
of
his
thinly
covered
joints
when
you
was
tellin
about
stubbs
yesterday
i
thought
you
meant
someone
belonging
to
the
company
you
ought
to
have
seen
my
wife
lilly
shake
with
laughing
when
i
told
her
who
stubbs
was
yes
said
toby
at
a
loss
to
know
just
what
to
say
i
should
think
she
would
shake
when
she
she
does
replied
the
skeleton
if
you
could
see
her
when
something
funny
strikes
her
you
think
she
was
one
of
those
big
plates
of
jelly
that
they
have
in
the
bakeshop
and
mr
treat
looked
proudly
at
the
gaudy
picture
which
represented
his
wife
in
all
her
monstrosity
of
flesh
she
a
great
woman
toby
an
she
got
a
great
toby
nodded
his
head
in
assent
he
would
have
liked
to
say
something
nice
regarding
mrs
treat
but
he
really
did
not
know
what
to
say
so
he
simply
contented
himself
and
the
fond
husband
by
nodding
she
thinks
a
good
deal
of
you
toby
continued
the
skeleton
as
he
moved
his
chair
to
a
position
more
favorable
for
him
to
elevate
his
feet
on
the
edge
of
the
counter
and
placed
his
handkerchief
under
him
as
a
cushion
she
talking
of
you
all
the
time
and
if
you
was
such
a
little
fellow
i
should
begin
to
be
jealous
of
you
i
should
upon
my
you
both
very
good
stammered
toby
so
weighted
down
by
a
sense
of
the
honor
heaped
upon
him
as
to
be
at
a
loss
for
words
an
she
wants
to
see
more
of
you
she
made
me
come
out
here
now
when
she
knew
lord
would
be
away
to
tell
you
that
we
goin
to
have
a
little
kind
of
a
friendly
dinner
in
our
tent
tomorrow
she
cooked
it
all
herself
or
she
going
to
and
we
want
you
to
come
in
an
have
some
with
toby
eyes
glistened
at
the
thought
of
the
unexpected
pleasure
and
then
his
face
grew
sad
as
he
replied
i
like
to
come
first
rate
mr
treat
but
i
do
lord
would
let
me
stay
away
from
the
shop
long
why
you
wo
have
any
work
to
do
tomorrow
toby
it
so
it
is
said
the
boy
with
a
pleased
smile
as
he
thought
of
the
day
of
rest
which
was
so
near
and
then
he
added
quickly
an
this
is
saturday
afternoon
what
fun
the
boys
at
home
are
havin
you
see
there
hai
any
school
saturday
afternoon
an
all
the
fellers
go
out
in
the
and
you
wish
you
were
there
to
go
with
them
do
you
asked
the
skeleton
sympathetically
indeed
i
do
exclaimed
toby
quickly
it
twice
as
good
as
any
circus
that
ever
but
you
did
think
so
before
you
came
with
us
did
you
i
did
know
so
much
about
circuses
then
as
i
do
now
replied
the
boy
sadly
mr
treat
saw
that
he
was
touching
on
a
sore
subject
and
one
which
was
arousing
sad
thoughts
in
his
little
companion
mind
and
he
hastened
to
change
it
at
once
then
i
can
tell
lilly
that
you
come
can
i
oh
yes
i
be
sure
to
be
there
an
i
want
you
to
know
just
how
good
i
think
you
both
are
to
that
all
right
toby
said
mr
treat
with
a
pleased
expression
on
his
face
an
you
may
bring
stubbs
with
you
if
you
thank
you
said
toby
i
sure
stubbs
will
be
just
as
glad
to
come
as
i
shall
but
where
will
we
be
tomorrow
right
here
we
always
stay
over
sunday
at
the
place
where
we
show
saturday
but
i
must
be
going
or
lilly
will
worry
her
life
out
of
her
for
fear
i
somewhere
getting
cold
she
awful
careful
of
me
that
woman
is
you
be
on
hand
tomorrow
at
one
wo
you
indeed
i
will
said
toby
emphatically
an
i
bring
stubbs
with
me
with
a
friendly
nod
of
his
head
the
skeleton
hurried
away
to
reassure
his
wife
that
he
was
safe
and
well
and
before
he
had
hardly
disappeared
within
the
tent
toby
had
another
caller
who
was
none
other
than
his
old
friend
old
ben
the
driver
well
my
boy
shouted
ben
in
his
cheery
hearty
tones
i
seen
you
since
you
left
the
wagon
so
sudden
last
night
did
you
get
shook
up
much
oh
no
replied
toby
you
see
i
hai
very
big
an
then
i
struck
in
the
mud
so
i
got
off
pretty
that
a
fact
an
you
can
thank
your
lucky
stars
for
it
too
for
seen
grown
up
men
get
pitched
off
a
wagon
in
that
way
an
break
their
necks
doin
it
but
has
job
told
you
where
you
was
going
to
sleep
tonight
you
know
we
stay
over
here
till
i
did
think
anything
about
that
but
i
i
sleep
in
the
wagon
wo
i
you
can
sleep
at
the
hotel
if
you
want
to
but
the
beds
will
likely
be
dirty
an
if
you
take
my
advice
you
crawl
into
some
of
the
wagons
in
the
ben
then
explained
to
him
that
after
his
work
was
done
that
night
he
would
not
be
expected
to
report
for
duty
until
the
time
for
starting
on
sunday
night
and
concluded
his
remarks
by
saying
now
you
know
what
your
rights
are
an
do
you
let
job
impose
on
you
in
any
way
i
be
round
here
after
you
get
through
work
an
bunk
in
somewhere
the
arrival
of
lord
and
jacobs
put
a
stop
to
the
conversation
and
was
the
signal
for
toby
time
of
trial
it
seemed
to
him
and
with
good
reason
that
the
chief
delight
these
men
had
in
life
was
to
torment
him
for
neither
ever
spoke
a
pleasant
word
to
him
and
when
one
was
not
giving
him
some
difficult
work
to
do
or
finding
fault
in
some
way
the
other
would
be
sure
to
do
so
and
toby
had
very
little
comfort
from
the
time
he
began
work
in
the
morning
until
he
stopped
at
night
it
was
not
until
after
the
evening
performance
was
over
that
toby
had
a
chance
to
speak
with
stubbs
and
then
he
was
so
tired
that
he
simply
took
the
old
monkey
from
the
cage
nestled
him
under
his
jacket
and
lay
down
with
him
to
sleep
in
the
place
which
old
ben
had
selected
when
the
morning
came
stubbs
aroused
his
young
master
at
a
much
hour
than
he
would
have
awakened
had
he
been
left
to
himself
and
the
two
went
out
for
a
short
walk
before
breakfast
they
went
instinctively
toward
the
woods
and
when
the
shade
of
the
trees
was
once
reached
how
the
two
reveled
in
their
freedom
stubbs
climbed
into
the
trees
swung
himself
from
one
to
the
other
by
means
of
his
tail
gathered
half
ripe
nuts
which
he
threw
at
his
master
tried
to
catch
the
birds
and
had
a
good
time
generally
toby
stretched
at
full
length
on
the
mossy
bank
watched
the
antics
of
his
pet
laughing
boisterously
at
times
as
stubbs
would
do
some
one
thing
more
comical
than
usual
and
forgot
there
was
in
this
world
such
a
thing
as
a
circus
or
such
a
man
as
job
lord
it
was
to
toby
a
morning
without
a
flaw
and
he
took
no
heed
of
the
time
until
the
sound
of
the
church
bells
warned
him
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
reminding
him
at
the
same
time
of
where
he
should
be
where
he
would
be
if
he
were
at
home
with
uncle
daniel
in
the
mean
time
the
old
monkey
had
been
trying
to
attract
his
young
master
attention
and
failing
in
his
efforts
he
came
down
from
the
tree
crept
softly
up
to
toby
and
nestled
his
head
under
the
boy
arm
this
little
act
of
devotion
seemed
to
cause
toby
grief
to
burst
forth
afresh
and
clasping
the
monkey
around
the
neck
hugging
him
close
to
his
bosom
he
sobbed
oh
stubbs
stubbs
how
lonesome
we
are
if
we
was
only
at
uncle
we
be
the
two
happiest
people
in
all
this
world
we
could
play
on
the
hay
or
go
up
to
the
pasture
or
go
down
to
the
village
an
i
work
my
fingers
off
if
i
could
only
be
there
just
once
more
it
was
wicked
for
me
to
run
away
an
now
i
gettin
paid
for
he
hugged
the
monkey
closely
swaying
his
body
to
and
fro
and
presenting
a
perfect
picture
of
grief
the
monkey
not
knowing
what
to
make
of
this
changed
mood
cowered
whimperingly
in
his
arms
looking
up
into
his
face
and
licking
the
boy
hands
whenever
he
had
the
opportunity
it
was
some
time
before
toby
grief
exhausted
itself
and
then
still
clasping
the
monkey
he
hurried
out
of
the
woods
toward
the
town
and
the
now
thoroughly
hated
circus
tents
the
clocks
were
just
striking
one
as
toby
entered
the
inclosure
used
by
the
show
as
a
place
of
performance
and
remembering
his
engagement
with
the
skeleton
and
his
wife
he
went
directly
to
their
tent
from
the
odors
which
assailed
him
as
he
entered
it
was
very
evident
that
a
feast
of
no
mean
proportions
was
in
course
of
preparation
and
toby
keen
appetite
returned
in
full
vigor
even
the
monkey
seemed
affected
by
the
odor
for
he
danced
about
on
his
master
shoulder
and
chattered
so
that
toby
was
obliged
to
choke
him
a
little
in
order
to
make
him
present
a
respectable
appearance
when
toby
reached
the
interior
of
the
tent
he
was
astonished
at
the
extent
of
the
preparations
that
were
being
made
and
gazed
around
him
in
surprise
the
platform
on
which
the
lean
man
and
fat
woman
were
in
the
habit
of
exhibiting
themselves
now
bore
a
long
table
loaded
with
eatables
and
from
the
fact
that
eight
or
ten
chairs
were
ranged
around
it
toby
understood
that
he
was
not
the
only
guest
invited
to
the
feast
some
little
attempt
had
also
been
made
at
decoration
by
festooning
that
end
of
the
tent
where
the
platform
was
placed
with
two
or
three
flags
and
some
streamers
and
the
tent
poles
also
were
fringed
with
tissue
paper
of
the
brightest
colors
toby
had
only
time
enough
to
notice
this
when
the
skeleton
advanced
toward
him
and
with
the
liveliest
appearance
of
pleasure
said
as
he
took
him
by
the
hands
with
a
grip
that
made
him
wince
it
gives
me
great
joy
tyler
to
welcome
you
at
one
of
our
little
home
reunions
if
one
can
call
a
tent
that
is
moved
every
day
in
the
week
toby
hardly
knew
whom
mr
treat
referred
to
when
he
said
mr
tyler
but
by
the
time
his
hands
were
released
from
the
bony
grasp
he
understood
that
it
was
himself
who
was
spoken
to
the
skeleton
then
formally
introduced
him
to
the
other
guests
present
who
were
sitting
at
one
end
of
the
tent
and
evidently
anxiously
awaiting
the
coming
feast
these
said
mr
treat
as
he
waved
his
hand
toward
two
white
haired
pink
eyed
young
ladies
who
sat
with
their
arms
twined
around
each
other
waist
and
had
been
eying
the
monkey
with
some
appearance
of
fear
are
the
miss
cushings
known
to
the
world
as
the
albino
children
they
command
a
large
salary
and
form
a
very
attractive
feature
of
our
the
young
ladies
arose
at
the
same
time
as
if
they
had
been
the
siamese
twins
and
could
not
act
independently
of
each
other
and
bowed
toby
made
the
best
bow
he
was
capable
of
and
the
monkey
made
frantic
efforts
to
escape
as
if
he
would
enjoy
twisting
his
paws
in
their
perpendicular
hair
and
this
continued
mr
treat
pointing
to
a
sickly
sour
looking
individual
who
was
sitting
apart
from
the
others
with
his
arms
folded
and
looking
as
if
he
was
counting
the
very
seconds
before
the
dinner
should
begin
is
the
wonderful
signor
castro
whose
sword
swallowing
feats
you
have
doubtless
heard
toby
stepped
back
just
one
step
as
if
overwhelmed
by
awe
at
beholding
the
signor
in
the
guise
of
a
humble
individual
and
the
gentleman
who
gained
his
livelihood
by
swallowing
swords
unbent
his
dignity
so
far
as
to
unfold
his
arms
and
present
a
very
dirty
looking
hand
for
toby
to
shake
the
boy
took
hold
of
the
outstretched
hand
wondering
why
the
signor
never
used
soap
and
water
and
stubbs
apparently
afraid
of
the
sour
looking
man
retreated
to
toby
shoulder
where
he
sat
chattering
and
scolding
about
the
introduction
again
the
skeleton
waved
his
hand
and
this
time
he
introduced
mademoiselle
spelletti
the
wonderful
snake
charmer
whose
exploits
in
this
country
and
before
the
crowned
heads
of
europe
had
caused
the
whole
world
to
stand
aghast
at
her
mademoiselle
spelletti
was
a
very
ordinary
looking
young
lady
of
about
years
of
age
who
looked
very
much
as
if
her
name
might
originally
have
been
murphy
and
she
too
extended
a
hand
for
toby
to
grasp
only
her
hand
was
clean
and
she
appeared
to
be
a
very
much
more
pleasant
acquaintance
than
the
gentleman
who
swallowed
swords
this
ended
the
introductions
and
toby
was
just
looking
around
for
a
seat
when
mrs
treat
the
fat
lady
and
the
giver
of
the
feast
which
was
about
to
come
and
which
already
smelled
so
invitingly
entered
from
behind
a
curtain
of
canvas
where
the
cooking
stove
was
supposed
to
be
located
she
had
every
appearance
of
being
the
cook
for
the
occasion
her
sleeves
were
rolled
up
her
hair
tumbled
and
frowzy
and
there
were
several
unmistakable
marks
of
grease
on
the
front
of
her
calico
dress
she
waited
for
no
ceremony
but
rushed
up
to
toby
and
taking
him
in
her
arms
gave
him
such
a
squeeze
that
there
seemed
to
be
every
possibility
that
she
would
break
all
the
bones
in
his
body
and
she
kept
him
so
long
in
this
bearlike
embrace
that
stubbs
reached
his
little
brown
paws
over
and
got
such
a
hold
of
her
hair
that
all
present
save
signor
castro
rushed
forward
to
release
her
from
the
monkey
grasp
you
dear
little
thing
said
mrs
treat
paying
but
slight
attention
to
the
hair
pulling
she
had
just
undergone
and
holding
toby
at
length
so
that
she
could
look
into
his
face
you
were
so
late
that
i
was
afraid
you
was
coming
and
my
dinner
would
have
tasted
half
so
good
if
you
had
been
here
to
eat
toby
hardly
knew
what
to
say
for
this
hearty
welcome
and
he
managed
to
tell
the
large
and
kind
hearted
lady
that
he
had
had
no
idea
of
missing
the
dinner
and
that
he
was
very
glad
she
wanted
him
to
come
want
you
to
come
you
dear
little
thing
she
exclaimed
as
she
gave
him
another
hug
but
careful
not
to
give
stubbs
a
chance
of
grasping
her
hair
again
of
course
i
wanted
you
to
come
for
this
dinner
has
been
got
up
so
that
you
could
meet
these
people
here
and
so
that
they
could
see
toby
was
entirely
at
a
loss
to
know
what
to
say
to
this
overwhelming
compliment
and
for
that
reason
did
not
say
anything
only
submitting
patiently
to
the
third
hug
which
was
all
mrs
treat
had
time
to
give
him
as
she
was
obliged
to
rush
behind
the
canvas
screen
again
as
there
were
unmistakable
sounds
of
something
boiling
over
on
the
stove
you
excuse
me
said
the
skeleton
with
an
air
of
dignity
waving
his
hand
once
more
toward
the
assembled
company
but
while
introducing
you
to
tyler
i
had
almost
forgotten
to
introduce
him
to
you
this
ladies
and
gentlemen
and
here
he
touched
toby
on
the
shoulder
as
if
he
were
some
living
curiosity
whose
habits
and
mode
of
capture
he
was
about
to
explain
to
a
party
of
spectators
is
toby
tyler
of
whom
you
heard
on
the
night
when
the
monkey
cage
was
smashed
and
who
now
carries
with
him
the
identical
monkey
which
was
presented
to
him
by
the
manager
of
this
great
show
as
a
token
of
esteem
for
his
skill
and
bravery
in
capturing
the
entire
lot
of
monkeys
without
a
single
by
the
time
that
mr
treat
got
through
with
his
long
speech
toby
felt
very
much
as
if
he
were
some
wonderful
creature
whom
the
skeleton
was
exhibiting
but
he
managed
to
rise
to
his
feet
and
duck
his
little
red
head
in
his
best
imitation
of
a
bow
then
he
sat
down
and
hugged
stubbs
to
cover
his
confusion
one
of
the
albino
children
now
came
forward
and
while
stroking
stubbs
hair
looked
so
intently
at
toby
that
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
say
which
she
regarded
as
the
curiosity
himself
or
the
monkey
therefore
he
hastened
to
say
modestly
i
did
do
much
toward
catchin
the
monkeys
stubbs
here
did
almost
all
of
it
an
i
only
led
in
there
there
my
boy
said
the
skeleton
in
a
fatherly
tone
heard
the
whole
story
from
old
ben
an
i
let
you
get
out
of
it
like
that
we
all
know
what
you
did
an
it
no
use
for
you
to
deny
any
part
of
stubbs
at
a
party
toby
was
about
to
say
that
he
did
not
intend
to
represent
the
matter
other
than
it
really
was
when
a
voice
from
behind
the
canvas
screen
arrested
further
conversation
come
an
help
me
carry
these
things
something
very
like
a
smile
of
satisfaction
passed
over
signor
face
as
he
heard
this
which
told
him
that
the
time
for
the
feast
was
near
at
hand
and
the
snake
charmer
as
well
as
the
albino
children
seemed
quite
as
much
pleased
as
did
the
sword
swallower
you
will
excuse
me
ladies
and
gentlemen
said
the
skeleton
in
an
important
tone
i
must
help
lilly
and
then
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
helping
you
to
some
of
her
cooking
which
if
i
do
say
it
that
ought
is
as
good
as
can
be
found
in
this
entire
then
he
too
disappeared
behind
the
canvas
screen
left
alone
toby
looked
at
the
ladies
and
the
ladies
looked
at
him
in
perfect
silence
while
the
sword
swallower
grimly
regarded
them
all
until
mr
treat
reappeared
bearing
on
a
platter
an
immense
turkey
as
nicely
browned
as
any
thanksgiving
turkey
toby
ever
saw
behind
him
came
his
fat
wife
carrying
several
dishes
each
of
which
emitted
a
most
fragrant
odor
and
as
these
were
placed
upon
the
table
the
spirits
of
the
sword
swallower
seemed
to
revive
and
he
smiled
pleasantly
while
even
the
ladies
appeared
animated
by
the
sight
and
odor
of
the
good
things
which
they
were
to
be
called
upon
so
soon
to
pass
judgment
several
times
did
and
mrs
treat
bustle
in
and
out
from
behind
the
screen
and
each
time
they
made
some
addition
to
that
which
was
upon
the
table
until
toby
began
to
fear
that
they
would
never
finish
and
the
sword
swallower
seemed
unable
to
restrain
his
impatience
at
last
the
finishing
touch
had
been
put
to
the
table
the
last
dish
placed
in
position
and
then
with
a
certain
kind
of
grace
which
no
one
but
a
man
as
thin
as
mr
treat
could
assume
he
advanced
to
the
edge
of
the
platform
and
said
ladies
and
gentlemen
nothing
gives
me
greater
pleasure
than
to
invite
you
all
including
tyler
friend
stubbs
to
the
bountiful
repast
which
my
lilly
has
prepared
for
at
this
point
mr
treat
speech
for
it
certainly
seemed
as
if
he
had
commenced
to
make
one
was
broken
off
in
a
most
summary
manner
his
wife
had
come
up
behind
him
and
with
as
much
ease
as
if
he
had
been
a
child
lifted
him
from
off
the
floor
and
placed
him
gently
in
the
chair
at
the
head
of
the
table
come
right
up
and
get
dinner
she
said
to
her
guests
if
you
had
waited
until
samuel
had
finished
his
speech
everything
on
the
table
would
have
been
stone
the
guests
proceeded
to
obey
her
kindly
command
and
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
the
sword
swallower
had
no
better
manners
than
to
jump
on
to
the
platform
with
one
bound
and
seat
himself
at
the
table
with
the
most
unseemly
haste
the
others
and
more
especially
toby
proceeded
in
a
leisurely
and
more
dignified
manner
a
seat
had
been
placed
by
the
side
of
the
one
intended
for
toby
for
the
accommodation
of
stubbs
who
suffered
a
napkin
to
be
tied
under
his
chin
and
behaved
generally
in
a
manner
that
gladdened
the
heart
of
his
young
master
mr
treat
cut
generous
slices
from
the
turkey
for
each
guest
and
mrs
treat
piled
their
plates
high
with
all
sorts
of
vegetables
complaining
after
the
manner
of
housewives
generally
that
the
food
was
not
cooked
as
she
would
like
to
have
had
it
and
declaring
that
she
had
had
poor
luck
with
everything
that
morning
when
she
firmly
believed
in
her
heart
that
her
table
had
never
looked
better
after
the
company
had
had
the
edge
taken
off
their
appetites
which
effect
was
produced
on
the
sword
swallower
only
after
he
had
been
helped
three
different
times
the
conversation
began
by
the
fat
woman
asking
toby
how
he
got
along
with
lord
toby
could
not
give
a
very
good
account
of
his
employer
but
he
had
the
good
sense
not
to
cast
a
damper
on
a
party
of
pleasure
by
reciting
his
own
troubles
so
he
said
evasively
i
guess
i
shall
get
along
pretty
well
now
that
i
have
got
so
many
just
as
he
had
commenced
to
speak
the
skeleton
had
put
into
his
mouth
a
very
large
piece
of
turkey
very
much
larger
in
proportion
than
himself
and
when
toby
had
finished
speaking
he
started
to
say
something
evidently
not
very
complimentary
to
lord
but
what
it
was
the
company
never
knew
for
just
as
he
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
the
food
went
down
the
wrong
way
his
face
became
a
bright
purple
and
it
was
quite
evident
that
he
was
choking
toby
was
alarmed
and
sprang
from
his
chair
to
assist
his
friend
upsetting
stubbs
from
his
seat
causing
him
to
scamper
up
the
tent
pole
with
the
napkin
still
tied
around
his
neck
and
to
scold
in
his
most
vehement
manner
before
toby
could
reach
the
skeleton
however
the
fat
woman
had
darted
toward
her
lean
husband
caught
him
by
the
arm
and
was
pounding
his
back
by
the
time
toby
got
there
so
vigorously
that
the
boy
was
afraid
her
enormous
hand
would
go
through
his
tissue
paper
like
frame
i
would
said
toby
in
alarm
you
may
break
do
you
get
frightened
said
mrs
treat
turning
her
husband
completely
over
and
still
continuing
the
drumming
process
he
often
taken
this
way
he
such
a
glutton
that
he
try
to
swallow
the
turkey
whole
if
he
could
get
it
in
his
mouth
an
he
so
thin
that
anything
sticks
in
his
i
should
think
you
break
him
all
up
said
toby
apologetically
as
he
resumed
his
seat
at
the
table
he
do
look
as
if
he
could
stand
very
much
of
that
sort
of
but
apparently
mr
treat
could
stand
very
much
more
than
toby
gave
him
credit
for
because
at
this
juncture
he
stopped
coughing
and
his
face
fast
assumed
its
natural
hue
his
attentive
wife
seeing
that
he
had
ceased
struggling
lifted
him
in
her
arms
and
sat
him
down
in
his
chair
with
a
force
that
threatened
to
snap
his
head
off
there
she
said
as
he
wheezed
a
little
from
the
effects
of
the
shock
now
see
if
you
can
behave
yourself
an
chew
your
meat
as
you
ought
to
one
of
these
days
when
you
alone
you
try
that
game
and
that
be
the
last
of
if
he
try
to
do
one
of
my
tricks
long
enough
he
get
so
that
there
would
hardly
anything
choke
him
the
sword
swallower
ventured
to
suggest
mildly
as
he
wiped
a
small
stream
of
cranberry
sauce
from
his
chin
and
laid
a
well
polished
turkey
bone
by
the
side
of
his
plate
i
like
to
see
him
try
it
said
the
fat
lady
with
just
a
shade
of
anger
in
her
voice
then
turning
toward
her
husband
she
said
emphatically
samuel
do
you
ever
let
me
catch
you
swallowing
a
sword
i
wo
my
love
i
wo
and
i
will
try
to
chew
my
meat
more
replied
the
very
thin
glutton
in
a
feeble
tone
toby
thought
that
perhaps
the
skeleton
might
keep
the
first
part
of
that
promise
but
he
was
not
quite
sure
about
the
last
it
required
no
little
coaxing
on
the
part
of
both
toby
and
mrs
treat
to
induce
stubbs
to
come
down
from
his
lofty
perch
but
the
task
was
accomplished
at
last
and
by
the
gift
of
a
very
large
doughnut
he
was
induced
to
resume
his
seat
at
the
table
the
time
had
now
come
when
the
duties
of
a
host
in
his
own
peculiar
way
of
viewing
them
devolved
upon
mr
treat
and
he
said
as
he
pushed
his
chair
back
a
short
distance
from
the
table
and
tried
to
polish
the
front
of
his
vest
with
his
napkin
i
do
want
this
fact
lost
sight
of
because
it
is
an
important
one
everyone
must
remember
that
we
have
gathered
here
to
meet
and
become
better
acquainted
with
the
latest
and
best
addition
to
this
circus
toby
poor
toby
as
the
company
all
looked
directly
at
him
and
mrs
treat
nodded
her
enormous
head
energetically
as
if
to
say
that
she
agreed
exactly
with
her
husband
the
poor
boy
face
grew
very
red
and
the
squash
pie
lost
its
flavor
although
tyler
may
not
be
exactly
one
of
us
owing
to
the
fact
that
he
does
not
belong
to
the
profession
but
is
only
one
of
the
adjuncts
to
it
so
to
speak
continued
the
skeleton
in
a
voice
which
was
fast
being
raised
to
its
highest
pitch
we
feel
proud
after
his
exploits
at
the
time
of
the
accident
to
have
him
with
us
and
gladly
welcome
him
now
through
the
medium
of
this
little
feast
prepared
by
my
here
the
albino
children
nodded
their
heads
in
approval
and
the
sword
swallower
gave
a
grunt
of
assent
and
thus
encouraged
the
skeleton
proceeded
i
feel
when
i
say
that
we
like
and
admire
tyler
all
present
will
agree
with
me
and
all
would
like
to
hear
him
say
a
word
for
the
skeleton
seemed
to
have
expressed
the
views
of
those
present
remarkably
well
judging
from
their
expressions
of
pleasure
and
assent
and
all
waited
for
the
honored
guest
to
speak
toby
knew
that
he
must
say
something
but
he
could
think
of
a
single
thing
he
tried
over
and
over
again
to
call
to
his
mind
something
which
he
had
read
as
to
how
people
acted
and
what
they
said
when
they
were
expected
to
speak
at
a
dinner
table
but
his
thoughts
refused
to
go
back
for
him
and
the
silence
was
actually
becoming
painful
finally
and
with
the
greatest
effort
he
managed
to
say
with
a
very
perceptible
stammer
and
while
his
face
was
growing
very
red
i
know
i
ought
to
say
something
to
pay
for
this
big
dinner
that
you
said
was
gotten
up
for
me
but
i
do
know
what
to
say
unless
to
thank
you
for
it
you
see
i
hai
big
enough
to
say
much
an
as
uncle
says
i
do
amount
to
very
much
for
eatin
an
i
guess
he
right
you
all
real
good
to
me
an
when
i
get
to
be
a
man
try
to
do
as
much
for
toby
had
risen
to
his
feet
when
he
began
to
make
his
speech
and
while
he
was
speaking
stubbs
had
crawled
over
into
his
chair
when
he
finished
he
sat
down
again
without
looking
behind
him
and
of
course
sat
plump
on
the
monkey
there
was
a
loud
outcry
from
stubbs
a
little
frightened
noise
from
toby
an
instant
scrambling
and
then
boy
monkey
and
chair
tumbled
off
the
platform
landing
on
the
ground
in
an
indescribable
mass
from
which
the
monkey
extricated
himself
more
quickly
than
toby
could
and
again
took
refuge
on
the
top
of
the
tent
pole
of
course
all
the
guests
ran
to
toby
assistance
and
while
the
fat
woman
poked
him
all
over
to
see
that
none
of
his
bones
were
broken
the
skeleton
brushed
the
dirt
from
his
clothes
all
this
time
the
monkey
screamed
yelled
and
danced
around
on
the
tent
pole
and
ropes
as
if
his
feelings
had
received
a
shock
from
which
he
could
never
recover
i
did
mean
to
end
it
up
that
way
but
it
was
stubbs
fault
said
toby
as
soon
as
quiet
had
been
restored
and
the
guests
with
the
exception
of
the
monkey
were
seated
at
the
table
once
more
of
course
you
did
said
mrs
treat
in
a
kindly
tone
but
you
feel
bad
about
it
one
bit
for
you
ought
to
thank
your
lucky
stars
that
you
did
break
any
of
your
i
i
had
said
toby
soberly
as
he
looked
back
at
the
scene
of
his
disaster
and
then
up
at
the
chattering
monkey
that
had
caused
all
the
trouble
shortly
after
this
stubbs
having
again
been
coaxed
down
from
his
lofty
position
toby
took
his
departure
promising
to
call
as
often
during
the
week
as
he
could
get
away
from
his
exacting
employers
just
outside
the
tent
he
met
old
ben
who
said
as
he
showed
signs
of
indulging
in
another
of
his
internal
laughing
spells
hello
has
the
skeleton
an
his
lily
of
a
wife
been
givin
a
blowout
to
you
too
they
invited
me
in
there
to
dinner
said
toby
modestly
of
course
they
did
of
course
they
did
replied
ben
with
a
chuckle
they
carries
a
cookin
stove
along
with
so
they
can
give
these
little
spreads
whenever
we
stay
over
a
day
in
a
place
oh

there
and
did
they
ask
you
to
make
a
speech
of
course

they
try
it
on
you
yes
said
toby
mournfully
an
i
tumbled
off
the
platform
when
i
got
i
did
do
exactly
that
replied
ben
thoughtfully
but
i
you
got
too
much
steam
on
seein
how
it
was
likely
your
first
speech
now
you
better
go
into
the
tent
an
try
to
get
a
little
sleep

a
long
ride

over
a
rough
road
an
you
wo
get
more
a
cat
nap
all
but
where
are
you
going
asked
toby
as
he
shifted
stubbs
over
to
his
other
shoulder
preparatory
to
following
his
friend
advice
i
goin
to
church
said
ben
and
then
toby
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
the
old
driver
had
made
some
attempt
at
dressing
up
been
with
the
circus
man
an
boy
for
nigh
to
forty
years
an
i
allus
go
to
meetin
once
on
sunday
it
somethin
i
promised
my
old
mother
i
would
do
an
i
hai
broke
my
promise
why
do
you
take
me
with
you
asked
toby
wistfully
as
he
thought
of
the
little
church
on
the
hill
at
home
and
wished
oh
so
earnestly
that
he
was
there
then
even
at
the
risk
of
being
thumped
on
the
head
with
uncle
daniel
book
if
i
seen
you
this
mornin
i
would
said
ben
but
now
you
must
try
to
bottle
up
some
sleep
tonight
an
next
sunday
i
take
with
these
words
old
ben
started
off
and
toby
proceeded
to
carry
out
his
wishes
although
he
rather
doubted
the
possibility
of
bottling
up
any
sleep
that
afternoon
he
lay
down
on
the
top
of
the
wagon
after
having
put
stubbs
inside
with
the
others
of
his
tribe
and
in
a
very
few
moments
the
boy
was
sound
asleep
dreaming
of
a
dinner
party
at
which
stubbs
made
a
speech
and
he
himself
scampered
up
and
down
the
tent
pole
xi
a
stormy
night
when
toby
awoke
it
was
nearly
dark
and
the
bustle
around
him
told
very
plainly
that
the
time
for
departure
was
near
at
hand
he
rubbed
his
eyes
just
enough
to
make
sure
that
he
was
thoroughly
awake
and
then
jumped
down
from
his
rather
lofty
bed
and
ran
around
to
the
door
of
the
cage
to
assure
himself
that
stubbs
was
safe
this
done
his
preparations
for
the
journey
were
made
now
toby
noticed
that
each
one
of
the
drivers
was
clad
in
rubber
clothing
and
after
listening
for
a
moment
he
learned
the
cause
of
their
waterproof
garments
it
was
raining
very
hard
and
toby
thought
with
dismay
of
the
long
ride
that
he
would
have
to
take
on
the
top
of
the
monkeys
cage
with
no
protection
whatever
save
that
afforded
by
his
ordinary
clothing
while
he
was
standing
by
the
side
of
his
wagon
wondering
how
he
should
get
along
old
ben
came
in
the
water
was
pouring
from
his
clothes
in
little
rivulets
and
he
afforded
most
unmistakable
evidence
of
the
damp
state
of
the
weather
it
a
nasty
night
my
boy
said
the
old
driver
in
much
the
same
cheery
tone
that
he
would
have
used
had
he
been
informing
toby
that
it
was
a
beautiful
moonlight
evening
i
guess
i
get
wet
said
toby
ruefully
as
he
looked
up
at
the
lofty
seat
which
he
was
to
occupy
bless
me
said
ben
as
if
the
thought
had
just
come
to
him
it
do
for
you
to
ride
outside
on
a
night
like
this
you
wait
here
an
see
what
i
can
do
for
the
old
man
hurried
off
to
the
other
end
of
the
tent
and
almost
before
toby
thought
he
had
time
to
go
as
far
as
the
ring
he
returned
it
all
right
he
said
and
this
time
in
a
gruff
voice
as
if
he
were
announcing
some
misfortune
you
to
ride
in
the
women
wagon
come
with
toby
followed
without
a
question
though
he
was
wholly
at
a
loss
to
understand
what
the
women
wagon
was
for
he
had
never
seen
anything
which
looked
like
one
he
soon
learned
however
when
old
ben
stopped
in
front
or
rather
at
the
end
of
a
long
covered
wagon
that
looked
like
an
omnibus
except
that
it
was
considerably
longer
and
the
seats
inside
were
divided
by
arms
padded
to
make
them
comfortable
to
lean
against
here
the
boy
said
ben
as
he
lifted
toby
up
on
the
step
gave
him
a
gentle
push
to
intimate
that
he
was
to
get
inside
and
then
left
him
as
toby
stepped
inside
he
saw
that
the
wagon
was
nearly
full
of
women
and
children
and
fearing
lest
he
should
take
a
seat
that
belonged
to
someone
else
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
wagon
not
knowing
what
to
do
why
do
you
sit
down
little
boy
asked
one
of
the
ladies
after
toby
had
remained
standing
nearly
five
minutes
and
the
wagon
was
about
to
start
well
said
toby
with
some
hesitation
as
he
looked
around
at
the
two
or
three
empty
seats
that
remained
i
did
want
to
get
in
anybody
else
place
an
i
did
know
where
to
come
right
here
said
the
lady
as
she
pointed
to
a
seat
by
the
side
of
a
little
girl
who
did
not
look
any
older
than
toby
the
lady
who
usually
occupies
that
seat
will
not
be
here
tonight
and
you
can
have
thank
you
said
toby
as
he
sat
timidly
down
on
the
edge
of
the
seat
hardly
daring
to
sit
back
comfortably
and
feeling
very
awkward
meanwhile
but
congratulating
himself
on
being
thus
protected
from
the
pouring
rain
the
wagon
started
and
as
each
one
talked
with
her
neighbor
toby
felt
a
most
dismal
sense
of
loneliness
and
almost
wished
that
he
was
riding
on
the
monkey
cart
with
ben
where
he
could
have
someone
to
talk
with
he
gradually
pushed
himself
back
into
a
more
comfortable
position
and
had
then
an
opportunity
of
seeing
more
plainly
the
young
girl
who
rode
by
his
side
she
was
quite
as
young
as
toby
and
small
of
her
age
but
there
was
an
old
look
about
her
face
that
made
the
boy
think
of
her
as
being
an
old
woman
cut
down
to
fit
children
clothes
toby
had
looked
at
her
so
earnestly
that
she
observed
him
and
asked
what
is
your
name
toby
what
do
you
do
in
the
circus
sell
candy
for
oh
i
thought
you
was
a
new
member
of
the
toby
knew
by
the
tone
of
her
voice
that
he
had
fallen
considerably
in
her
estimation
by
not
being
one
of
the
performers
and
it
was
some
little
time
before
he
ventured
to
speak
and
then
he
asked
timidly
what
do
you
do
i
ride
one
of
the
horses
with
are
you
the
little
girl
that
comes
out
with
the
lady
an
four
horses
asked
toby
in
awe
that
he
should
be
conversing
with
so
famous
a
person
yes
i
am
do
i
do
it
nicely
why
you
a
perfect
little
little
fairy
exclaimed
toby
after
hesitating
a
moment
to
find
some
word
which
would
exactly
express
his
idea
this
praise
seemed
to
please
the
young
lady
and
in
a
short
time
the
two
became
very
good
friends
even
if
toby
did
not
occupy
a
more
exalted
position
than
that
of
candy
seller
she
had
learned
from
him
all
about
the
accident
to
the
monkey
cage
and
about
stubbs
and
in
return
had
told
him
that
her
name
was
ella
mason
though
on
the
bills
she
was
called
mademoiselle
for
a
long
time
the
two
children
sat
talking
together
and
then
mademoiselle
jeannette
curled
herself
up
on
the
seat
with
her
head
in
her
mother
lap
and
went
to
sleep
toby
had
resolved
to
keep
awake
and
watch
her
for
he
was
struck
with
admiration
at
her
face
but
sleep
got
the
better
of
him
in
less
than
five
minutes
after
he
had
made
the
resolution
and
he
sat
bolt
upright
with
his
little
round
head
nodding
and
bobbing
until
it
seemed
almost
certain
that
he
would
shake
it
off
when
toby
awoke
the
wagon
was
drawn
up
by
the
side
of
the
road
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
preparations
were
being
made
for
the
entree
into
town
and
the
harsh
voice
of
job
lord
was
shouting
his
name
in
a
tone
that
boded
no
good
for
poor
toby
when
he
should
make
his
appearance
toby
would
have
hesitated
before
meeting
his
angry
employer
but
that
he
knew
it
would
only
make
matters
worse
for
him
when
he
did
show
himself
and
he
mentally
braced
himself
for
the
trouble
which
he
knew
was
coming
the
little
girl
whose
acquaintance
he
had
made
the
night
previous
was
still
sleeping
and
wishing
to
say
goodby
to
her
in
some
way
without
awakening
her
he
stooped
down
and
gently
kissed
the
skirt
of
her
dress
then
he
went
out
to
meet
his
master
lord
was
thoroughly
enraged
when
toby
left
the
wagon
and
saw
the
boy
just
as
he
stepped
to
the
ground
the
angry
man
gave
a
quick
glance
around
to
make
sure
that
none
of
toby
friends
were
in
sight
and
then
caught
him
by
the
coat
collar
and
commenced
to
whip
him
severely
with
the
small
rubber
cane
that
he
usually
carried
job
lord
lifted
the
poor
boy
entirely
clear
of
the
ground
and
each
blow
that
he
struck
could
be
heard
almost
the
entire
length
of
the
circus
train
you
been
makin
so
many
acquaintances
here
that
you
hai
to
do
any
work
he
said
savagely
as
he
redoubled
the
force
of
his
blows
oh
please
stop
please
stop
shrieked
the
poor
boy
in
his
agony
i
do
everything
you
tell
me
to
if
you
wo
strike
me
again
this
piteous
appeal
seemed
to
have
no
effect
upon
the
cruel
man
and
he
continued
to
whip
the
boy
despite
his
cries
and
entreaties
until
his
arm
fairly
ached
from
the
exertion
and
toby
body
was
crossed
and
recrossed
with
the
livid
marks
of
the
cane
now
let
see
whether
you
to
your
work
or
not
said
the
man
as
he
flung
toby
from
him
with
such
force
that
the
boy
staggered
reeled
and
nearly
fell
into
the
little
brook
that
flowed
by
the
roadside
i
make
you
understand
that
all
the
friends
you
whined
around
in
this
show
ca
save
you
from
a
lickin
when
i
get
ready
to
give
you
one
now
go
an
do
your
work
that
ought
to
have
been
done
an
hour
ago
lord
walked
away
with
the
proud
consciousness
of
a
man
who
has
achieved
a
great
victory
and
toby
was
limping
painfully
along
toward
the
cart
that
was
used
in
conveying
lord
stock
in
trade
when
he
felt
a
tiny
hand
slip
into
his
and
heard
a
childish
voice
say
do
cry
toby
sometime
when
i
get
big
enough
i
make
lord
sorry
that
he
whipped
you
as
he
did
and
i
big
enough
now
to
tell
him
just
what
kind
of
a
man
i
think
he
looking
around
toby
saw
his
little
acquaintance
of
the
evening
previous
and
he
tried
to
force
back
the
big
tears
that
were
rolling
down
his
cheeks
as
he
said
in
a
voice
choked
with
grief
you
awful
good
an
i
do
mind
the
lickin
when
you
say
you
sorry
for
me
i
i
deserve
it
for
runnin
away
from
uncle
did
it
hurt
you
much
she
asked
feelingly
it
did
when
he
was
doin
it
replied
toby
manfully
but
it
do
a
bit
now
that
you
then
i
go
and
talk
to
that
lord
and
i
come
and
see
you
again
after
we
get
into
town
said
the
little
miss
as
she
hurried
away
to
tell
the
candy
vender
what
she
thought
of
him
that
day
as
on
all
others
since
he
had
been
with
the
circus
toby
went
to
his
work
with
a
heavy
heart
and
time
and
time
again
did
he
count
the
money
which
had
been
given
him
by
kind
hearted
strangers
to
see
whether
he
had
enough
to
warrant
his
attempting
to
run
away
three
dollars
and
cents
was
the
total
amount
of
his
treasure
and
large
as
that
sum
appeared
to
him
he
could
not
satisfy
himself
that
he
had
sufficient
to
enable
him
to
get
back
to
the
home
which
he
had
so
wickedly
left
whenever
he
thought
of
this
home
of
the
uncle
daniel
who
had
in
charity
cared
for
him
a
motherless
fatherless
boy
and
of
returning
to
it
with
not
even
as
much
right
as
the
prodigal
son
of
whom
he
had
heard
uncle
daniel
tell
his
heart
sank
within
him
and
he
doubted
whether
he
would
be
allowed
to
remain
even
if
he
should
be
so
fortunate
as
ever
to
reach
guilford
again
this
day
passed
so
far
as
toby
was
concerned
very
much
as
had
the
others
he
could
not
satisfy
either
of
his
employers
try
as
hard
as
he
might
but
as
usual
he
met
with
two
or
three
kindly
disposed
people
who
added
to
the
fund
that
he
was
accumulating
for
his
second
venture
of
running
away
by
little
gifts
of
money
each
one
of
which
gladdened
his
heart
and
made
his
trouble
a
trifle
less
hard
to
bear
during
the
entire
week
he
was
thus
equally
fortunate
each
day
added
something
to
his
fund
and
each
night
it
seemed
to
toby
that
he
was
one
day
nearer
the
freedom
for
which
he
so
ardently
longed
the
skeleton
the
fat
lady
old
ben
the
albino
children
little
ella
and
even
the
sword
swallower
all
gave
him
a
kindly
word
as
they
passed
him
while
he
was
at
his
work
or
saw
him
as
the
preparations
for
the
grand
entree
were
being
made
the
time
had
passed
slowly
to
toby
and
yet
sunday
came
again
as
sundays
always
come
and
on
this
day
old
ben
hunted
him
up
made
him
wash
his
face
and
hands
until
they
fairly
shone
from
very
cleanliness
and
then
took
him
to
church
toby
was
surprised
to
find
that
it
was
really
a
pleasant
thing
to
be
able
to
go
to
church
after
being
deprived
of
it
and
was
more
light
hearted
than
he
had
yet
been
since
he
left
guilford
when
he
returned
to
the
tent
at
noon
the
skeleton
had
invited
him
to
another
dinner
party
but
toby
had
declined
the
invitation
agreeing
to
present
himself
in
time
for
supper
instead
he
hardly
cared
to
go
through
the
ordeal
of
another
state
dinner
and
besides
he
wanted
to
go
off
to
the
woods
with
the
old
monkey
where
he
could
enjoy
the
silence
of
the
forest
which
seemed
like
a
friend
to
him
because
it
reminded
him
of
home
taking
the
monkey
with
him
as
usual
he
inquired
the
nearest
way
to
a
grove
and
without
waiting
for
dinner
started
off
for
an
quiet
enjoyment
xii
toby
great
misfortune
the
town
in
which
the
circus
remained
over
sunday
was
a
small
one
and
a
brisk
walk
of
ten
minutes
sufficed
to
take
toby
into
a
secluded
portion
of
a
very
thickly
grown
wood
where
he
could
lie
upon
the
mossy
ground
and
fairly
revel
in
freedom
as
he
lay
upon
his
back
his
hands
under
his
head
and
his
eyes
directed
to
the
branches
of
the
trees
above
where
the
birds
twittered
and
sung
and
the
squirrels
played
in
fearless
sport
the
monkey
enjoyed
himself
in
his
way
by
playing
all
the
monkey
antics
he
knew
of
he
scrambled
from
tree
to
tree
swung
himself
from
one
branch
to
the
other
by
the
aid
of
his
tail
and
amused
both
himself
and
his
master
until
tired
by
his
exertions
he
crept
down
by
toby
side
and
lay
there
in
quiet
restful
content
one
of
toby
reasons
for
wishing
to
be
by
himself
that
afternoon
was
that
he
wanted
to
think
over
some
plan
of
escape
for
he
believed
that
he
had
nearly
money
enough
to
enable
him
to
make
a
bold
stroke
for
freedom
and
uncle
daniel
therefore
when
the
monkey
nestled
down
by
his
side
he
was
all
ready
to
confide
in
him
that
which
had
been
occupying
his
busy
little
brain
for
the
past
three
days
mr
stubbs
he
said
to
the
monkey
in
a
solemn
tone
we
goin
to
run
away
in
a
day
or
stubbs
did
not
seem
to
be
moved
in
the
least
at
this
very
startling
piece
of
intelligence
but
winked
his
bright
eyes
in
unconcern
and
toby
seeming
to
think
that
everything
which
he
said
had
been
understood
by
the
monkey
continued
i
got
a
good
deal
of
money
now
an
i
guess
there
enough
for
us
to
start
out
on
we
get
away
some
night
an
stay
in
the
woods
till
they
get
through
hunting
for
us
an
then
we
go
back
to
guilford
an
tell
uncle
if
he
only
take
us
back
we
never
go
to
sleep
in
meetin
any
more
an
we
be
just
as
good
as
we
know
how
now
let
see
how
much
money
we
toby
drew
from
a
pocket
which
he
had
been
at
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
make
in
his
shirt
a
small
bag
of
silver
and
spread
it
upon
the
ground
where
he
could
count
it
at
his
leisure
the
glittering
coin
instantly
attracted
the
monkey
attention
and
he
tried
by
every
means
to
thrust
his
little
black
paw
into
the
pile
but
toby
would
allow
nothing
of
that
sort
and
pushed
him
away
quite
roughly
then
he
grew
excited
and
danced
and
scolded
around
treasure
until
the
boy
had
hard
work
to
count
it
he
did
succeed
however
and
as
he
carefully
replaced
it
in
the
bag
he
said
to
the
monkey
there
seven
dollars
an
thirty
cents
in
that
bag
an
every
cent
of
it
is
mine
that
ought
to
take
care
of
us
for
a
good
while
stubbs
an
by
the
time
we
get
home
we
shall
be
rich
the
monkey
showed
his
pleasure
at
this
intelligence
by
putting
his
hand
inside
toby
clothes
to
find
the
bag
of
treasure
that
he
had
seen
secreted
there
and
two
or
three
times
to
the
great
delight
of
both
himself
and
the
boy
he
drew
forth
the
bag
which
was
immediately
taken
away
from
him
the
shadows
were
beginning
to
lengthen
in
the
woods
and
heeding
this
warning
of
the
coming
night
toby
took
the
monkey
on
his
arm
and
started
for
home
or
for
the
tent
which
was
the
only
place
he
could
call
home
as
he
walked
along
he
tried
to
talk
to
his
pet
in
a
serious
manner
but
the
monkey
remembering
where
he
had
seen
the
bright
coins
secreted
tried
so
hard
to
get
at
them
that
finally
toby
lost
all
patience
and
gave
him
quite
a
hard
cuff
on
the
ear
which
had
the
effect
of
keeping
him
quiet
for
a
time
that
night
toby
took
supper
with
the
skeleton
and
his
wife
and
he
enjoyed
the
meal
even
though
it
was
made
from
what
had
been
left
of
the
turkey
that
served
as
the
noonday
feast
more
than
he
did
the
state
dinner
where
he
was
obliged
to
pay
for
what
he
ate
by
the
torture
of
making
a
speech
there
were
no
guests
but
toby
present
and
and
mrs
treat
were
not
only
very
kind
but
so
attentive
that
he
was
actually
afraid
he
should
eat
so
much
as
to
stand
in
need
of
some
of
the
catnip
tea
which
mrs
treat
had
said
she
gave
to
her
husband
when
he
had
been
equally
foolish
the
skeleton
would
pile
his
plate
high
with
turkey
bones
from
one
side
and
the
fat
lady
would
heap
it
up
whenever
she
could
find
a
chance
with
all
sorts
of
food
from
the
other
until
toby
pushed
back
his
chair
his
appetite
completely
satisfied
if
it
never
had
been
so
before
toby
had
discussed
the
temper
of
his
employer
with
his
host
and
hostess
and
after
some
considerable
conversation
confided
in
them
his
determination
to
run
away
i
hate
awfully
to
have
you
go
said
mrs
treat
reflectively
but
it
a
good
deal
better
for
you
to
get
away
from
that
job
lord
if
you
can
it
would
do
to
let
him
know
that
you
had
any
idea
of
goin
for
he
watch
you
as
a
cat
watches
a
mouse
an
never
let
you
go
so
long
as
he
saw
a
chance
to
keep
you
i
heard
him
tellin
one
of
the
drivers
the
other
day
that
you
sold
more
goods
than
any
other
boy
he
ever
had
he
was
going
to
keep
you
with
him
all
be
careful
in
what
you
do
my
boy
said
the
skeleton
sagely
as
he
arranged
a
large
cushion
in
an
armchair
and
proceeded
to
make
ready
for
his
after
dinner
nap
be
sure
that
you
all
ready
before
you
start
an
when
you
do
go
get
a
good
ways
ahead
of
him
for
if
he
should
ever
catch
you
the
trouncin
you
get
would
be
toby
assured
his
friends
that
he
would
use
every
endeavor
to
make
his
escape
successful
when
he
did
start
and
mrs
treat
with
an
eye
to
the
boy
comfort
said
let
me
know
the
night
you
goin
an
i
fix
you
up
something
to
eat
so
you
wo
be
hungry
before
you
come
to
a
place
where
you
can
buy
as
these
kind
hearted
people
talked
with
him
and
were
ready
thus
to
aid
him
in
every
way
that
lay
in
their
power
toby
thought
that
he
had
been
very
fortunate
in
thus
having
made
so
many
kind
friends
in
a
place
where
he
was
having
so
much
trouble
it
was
not
until
he
heard
the
sounds
of
preparation
for
departure
that
he
left
the
skeleton
tent
and
then
with
stubbs
clasped
tightly
to
his
breast
he
hurried
over
to
the
wagon
where
old
ben
was
nearly
ready
to
start
all
right
toby
said
the
old
driver
as
the
boy
came
in
sight
i
was
afraid
you
was
goin
to
keep
me
waitin
for
the
first
time
jump
right
up
on
the
box
for
there
hai
no
time
to
lose
an
i
guess
you
have
to
carry
the
monkey
in
your
arms
for
i
do
want
to
stop
to
open
the
cage
i
just
as
soon
carry
him
an
a
little
rather
said
toby
as
he
clambered
up
on
the
high
seat
and
arranged
a
comfortable
place
in
his
lap
for
his
pet
to
sit
in
another
moment
the
heavy
team
had
started
and
nearly
the
entire
circus
was
on
the
move
now
tell
me
what
you
been
doin
since
i
left
you
said
old
ben
after
they
were
well
clear
of
the
town
and
he
could
trust
his
horses
to
follow
the
team
ahead
i
you
been
to
see
the
skeleton
an
his
mountain
of
a
wife
toby
gave
a
clear
account
of
where
he
had
been
and
what
he
had
done
and
when
he
concluded
he
told
old
ben
of
his
determination
to
run
away
and
asked
his
advice
on
the
matter
my
advice
said
ben
after
he
had
waited
some
time
to
give
due
weight
to
his
words
is
that
you
clear
out
from
this
show
just
as
soon
as
you
can
this
hai
no
fit
place
for
a
boy
of
your
age
to
be
in
the
sooner
you
get
back
where
you
started
from
an
get
to
school
the
better
but
job
lord
will
do
all
he
can
to
keep
you
from
goin
if
he
thinks
you
have
any
idea
of
leavin
toby
assured
ben
as
he
had
assured
the
skeleton
and
his
wife
that
he
would
be
very
careful
in
all
he
did
and
lay
his
plans
with
the
utmost
secrecy
and
then
he
asked
whether
ben
thought
the
amount
of
money
which
he
had
would
be
sufficient
to
carry
him
home
waal
that
depends
said
the
driver
slowly
if
you
go
to
yourself
all
over
creation
as
boys
are
very
apt
to
do
your
money
go
very
far
but
if
you
look
at
your
money
two
or
three
times
afore
you
spend
it
you
ought
to
get
back
and
have
a
dollar
or
two
the
two
talked
and
old
ben
offered
advice
until
toby
could
hardly
keep
his
eyes
open
and
almost
before
the
driver
concluded
his
sage
remarks
the
boy
had
stretched
himself
on
the
top
of
the
wagon
where
he
had
learned
to
sleep
without
being
shaken
off
and
was
soon
in
dreamland
the
monkey
nestled
down
snug
in
toby
bosom
did
not
appear
to
be
as
sleepy
as
was
his
master
but
popped
his
head
in
and
out
from
under
the
coat
as
if
watching
whether
the
boy
was
asleep
or
not
toby
was
awakened
by
a
scratching
on
his
face
as
if
the
monkey
was
dancing
a
hornpipe
on
that
portion
of
his
body
and
by
a
shrill
quick
chattering
which
caused
him
to
assume
an
upright
position
instantly
he
was
frightened
although
he
knew
not
at
what
and
looked
around
quickly
to
discover
the
cause
of
the
monkey
excitement
old
ben
was
asleep
on
his
box
while
the
horses
jogged
along
behind
the
other
teams
and
toby
failed
to
see
anything
whatever
which
should
have
caused
his
pet
to
become
so
excited
lie
down
an
behave
yourself
said
toby
as
sternly
as
possible
and
as
he
spoke
he
took
his
pet
by
the
collar
to
oblige
him
to
obey
his
command
the
moment
that
he
did
this
he
saw
the
monkey
throw
something
out
into
the
road
and
the
next
instant
he
also
saw
that
he
held
something
tightly
clutched
in
his
other
paw
it
required
some
little
exertion
and
active
movement
on
toby
part
to
enable
him
to
get
hold
of
that
paw
in
order
to
discover
what
it
was
which
stubbs
had
captured
but
the
instant
he
did
succeed
there
went
up
from
his
heart
such
a
cry
of
sorrow
as
caused
old
ben
to
start
up
in
alarm
and
the
monkey
to
cower
and
whimper
like
a
whipped
dog
what
is
it
toby
what
the
matter
asked
the
old
driver
as
he
peered
out
into
the
darkness
ahead
as
if
he
feared
some
danger
threatened
them
from
that
quarter
i
do
see
anything
what
is
it
mr
stubbs
has
thrown
all
my
money
away
cried
toby
holding
up
the
almost
empty
bag
which
a
short
time
previous
had
been
so
well
filled
with
silver
stubbs
thrown
the
money
away
repeated
ben
with
a
pause
between
each
word
as
if
he
could
not
understand
that
which
he
himself
was
saying
yes
sobbed
toby
as
he
shook
out
the
remaining
contents
of
the
bag
there
only
half
a
dollar
an
all
the
rest
is
the
rest
gone
again
repeated
ben
but
how
come
the
monkey
to
have
the
money
he
tried
to
get
at
it
out
in
the
woods
an
i
the
moment
i
got
asleep
he
felt
for
it
in
my
pockets
this
is
all
there
is
left
an
he
threw
away
some
just
as
i
woke
again
toby
held
the
bag
up
where
ben
could
see
it
and
again
his
grief
broke
out
anew
ben
could
say
nothing
he
realized
the
whole
situation
that
the
monkey
had
got
the
moneybag
while
toby
was
sleeping
that
in
his
play
he
had
thrown
it
away
piece
by
piece
and
he
knew
that
that
small
amount
of
silver
represented
liberty
in
the
boy
eyes
he
felt
that
there
was
nothing
he
could
say
which
would
assuage
toby
grief
and
he
remained
silent
do
you
we
could
go
back
an
get
it
asked
the
boy
after
the
intensity
of
his
grief
had
somewhat
subsided
no
toby
it
gone
replied
ben
sorrowfully
you
could
find
it
if
it
was
daylight
an
you
do
stand
a
ghost
of
a
chance
now
in
the
dark
do
take
on
so
my
boy
i
see
if
we
ca
make
it
up
to
you
in
some
toby
gave
no
heed
to
this
last
remark
of
ben
he
hugged
the
monkey
convulsively
to
his
breast
as
if
he
would
seek
consolation
from
the
very
one
who
had
wrought
the
ruin
and
rocking
himself
to
and
fro
he
said
in
a
voice
full
of
tears
and
sorrow
oh
stubbs
why
did
you
do
it
why
did
you
do
it
that
money
would
have
got
us
away
from
this
hateful
place
an
we
have
gone
back
to
uncle
where
we
have
been
so
happy
you
an
me
an
now
all
gone
all
gone
what
made
you
stubbs
what
made
you
do
such
a
bad
cruel
thing
oh
what
made
you
do
toby
do
take
on
so
said
ben
soothingly
there
was
so
very
much
money
there
after
all
an
you
soon
get
as
much
but
it
wo
be
for
a
good
while
an
we
could
have
been
in
the
good
old
home
long
before
i
can
get
so
much
that
true
my
boy
but
you
must
kinder
brace
up
an
not
give
way
so
about
it
perhaps
i
can
fix
it
so
the
fellers
will
make
it
up
to
you
give
stubbs
a
good
poundin
an
perhaps
that
make
you
feel
that
wo
bring
back
my
money
an
i
do
want
to
whip
him
cried
toby
hugging
his
pet
the
closer
because
of
this
suggestion
i
know
what
it
is
to
get
a
whippin
an
i
would
whip
a
dog
much
less
stubbs
who
did
know
any
then
you
must
try
to
take
it
like
a
man
said
ben
who
could
think
of
no
other
plan
by
which
the
boy
might
soothe
his
feelings
it
half
so
bad
as
it
might
be
an
you
must
try
to
keep
a
stiff
upper
lip
even
if
it
does
seem
hard
at
this
keeping
a
stiff
upper
lip
in
the
face
of
all
the
trouble
he
was
having
was
all
very
well
to
talk
about
but
toby
could
not
reduce
it
to
practice
or
at
least
not
so
soon
after
he
knew
of
his
loss
and
he
continued
to
rock
the
monkey
back
and
forth
to
whisper
in
his
ear
now
and
then
and
to
cry
as
if
his
heart
was
breaking
for
nearly
an
hour
ben
tried
in
his
rough
honest
way
to
comfort
him
but
without
success
and
it
was
not
until
the
boy
grief
had
spent
itself
that
he
would
listen
to
any
reasoning
all
this
time
the
monkey
had
remained
perfectly
quiet
submitting
to
toby
squeezing
without
making
any
effort
to
get
away
and
behaving
as
if
he
knew
he
had
done
wrong
and
was
trying
to
atone
for
it
he
looked
up
into
the
boy
face
every
now
and
then
with
such
a
penitent
expression
that
toby
finally
assured
him
of
forgiveness
and
begged
him
not
to
feel
so
badly
xiii
toby
attempts
to
resign
his
situation
at
last
it
was
possible
for
toby
to
speak
of
his
loss
with
some
degree
of
calmness
and
then
he
immediately
began
to
reckon
up
what
he
could
have
done
with
the
money
if
he
had
not
lost
it
now
see
here
toby
said
ben
earnestly
do
go
to
doin
anything
of
that
kind
the
money
lost
an
you
ca
get
it
back
by
talkin
so
the
very
best
thing
for
you
is
to
stop
thinkin
what
you
could
do
if
you
had
it
an
just
to
look
at
it
as
a
but
persisted
toby
i
tell
you
there
no
buts
about
it
said
ben
rather
sharply
stop
talkin
about
what
gone
an
just
go
to
thinkin
how
you
get
more
do
what
you
a
mind
to
the
monkey
but
do
keep
broodin
over
what
you
ca
toby
knew
that
the
advice
was
good
and
he
struggled
manfully
to
carry
it
into
execution
but
it
was
very
hard
work
at
all
events
there
was
no
sleep
for
his
eyes
that
night
and
when
just
about
daylight
the
train
halted
to
wait
a
more
seasonable
hour
in
which
to
enter
the
town
the
thought
of
what
he
might
have
done
with
his
lost
money
was
still
in
toby
mind
only
once
did
he
speak
crossly
to
the
monkey
and
that
was
when
he
put
him
into
the
cage
preparatory
to
commencing
his
morning
work
then
he
said
you
would
had
to
go
into
this
place
many
times
more
if
you
been
so
wicked
for
by
tomorrow
night
we
been
away
from
this
circus
an
on
the
way
to
home
an
uncle
now
you
spoiled
my
chance
an
your
own
for
a
good
while
to
come
an
i
hope
before
the
day
is
over
you
feel
as
bad
about
it
as
i
it
seemed
to
toby
as
if
the
monkey
understood
just
what
he
said
to
him
for
he
sneaked
over
into
one
corner
away
from
the
other
monkeys
and
sat
there
looking
very
penitent
and
very
dejected
then
with
a
heavy
heart
toby
began
his
day
work
hard
as
had
been
toby
lot
previous
to
losing
his
money
and
difficult
as
it
had
been
to
bear
the
cruelty
of
job
lord
and
his
precious
partner
jacobs
it
was
doubly
hard
now
while
this
sorrow
was
fresh
upon
him
previous
to
this
when
he
had
been
kicked
or
cursed
by
one
or
the
other
of
the
partners
toby
thought
exultantly
that
the
time
was
not
very
far
distant
when
he
should
be
beyond
the
reach
of
his
brutal
taskmasters
and
that
thought
had
given
him
strength
to
bear
all
that
had
been
put
upon
him
now
the
time
of
his
deliverance
from
this
bondage
seemed
very
far
off
and
each
cruel
word
or
blow
caused
him
the
greater
sorrow
because
of
the
thought
that
but
for
the
monkey
wickedness
he
would
have
been
nearly
free
from
that
which
made
his
life
so
very
miserable
if
he
had
looked
sad
and
mournful
before
he
looked
doubly
so
now
as
he
went
his
dreary
round
of
the
tent
crying
here
your
cold
lemonade
or
fresh
baked
peanuts
ten
cents
a
quart
and
each
day
there
were
some
in
the
audience
who
pitied
the
boy
because
of
the
misery
which
showed
so
plainly
in
his
face
and
they
gave
him
a
few
cents
more
than
his
price
for
what
he
was
selling
or
gave
him
money
without
buying
anything
at
all
thereby
aiding
him
to
lay
up
something
again
toward
making
his
escape
those
few
belonging
to
the
circus
who
knew
of
toby
intention
to
escape
tried
their
best
to
console
him
for
the
loss
of
his
money
and
that
kind
hearted
couple
the
skeleton
and
his
fat
wife
tried
to
force
him
to
take
a
portion
of
their
scanty
earnings
in
the
place
of
that
which
the
monkey
had
thrown
away
but
this
toby
positively
refused
to
do
and
to
the
arguments
which
they
advanced
as
reasons
why
they
should
help
him
along
he
only
replied
that
until
he
could
get
the
money
by
his
own
exertions
he
would
remain
with
lord
and
jacobs
and
get
along
as
best
he
could
every
hour
in
the
day
the
thought
of
what
might
have
been
if
he
had
not
lost
his
money
so
haunted
his
mind
that
finally
he
resolved
to
make
one
bold
stroke
and
tell
job
lord
that
he
did
not
want
to
travel
with
the
circus
any
longer
as
yet
he
had
not
received
the
two
dollars
which
had
been
promised
him
for
his
two
weeks
work
and
another
one
was
nearly
due
if
he
could
get
this
money
it
might
with
what
he
had
saved
again
suffice
to
pay
his
railroad
fare
to
guilford
and
if
it
would
not
he
resolved
to
accept
from
the
skeleton
sufficient
to
make
up
the
amount
needed
he
naturally
shrank
from
the
task
but
the
hope
that
he
might
possibly
succeed
gave
him
the
necessary
amount
of
courage
and
when
he
had
gotten
his
work
done
on
the
third
morning
after
he
had
lost
his
money
and
lord
appeared
to
be
in
an
unusually
good
temper
he
resolved
to
try
the
plan
it
was
just
before
the
dinner
hour
trade
had
been
exceptionally
good
and
lord
had
even
spoken
in
a
pleasant
tone
to
toby
when
he
told
him
to
fill
up
the
lemonade
pail
with
water
so
that
the
stock
might
not
be
disposed
of
too
quickly
and
with
too
little
profit
toby
poured
in
quite
as
much
water
as
he
thought
the
already
weak
mixture
could
receive
and
retain
any
flavor
of
lemon
and
then
as
his
employer
motioned
him
to
add
more
he
mixed
another
quart
in
secretly
wondering
what
it
would
taste
like
when
you
mixin
lemonade
for
circus
trade
said
lord
in
such
a
benign
fatherly
tone
that
one
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
believe
that
he
ever
spoke
harshly
do
be
afraid
of
water
for
there
where
the
profit
comes
in
always
have
a
piece
of
lemon
peel
floatin
on
the
top
of
every
glass
an
it
tastes
just
as
good
to
people
as
if
it
cost
twice
as
toby
could
not
agree
exactly
with
that
opinion
neither
did
he
think
it
wise
to
disagree
more
especially
since
he
was
going
to
ask
the
very
great
favor
of
being
discharged
therefore
he
nodded
his
head
gravely
and
began
to
stir
up
what
it
pleased
lord
to
call
lemonade
so
that
the
last
addition
might
be
more
thoroughly
mixed
with
the
others
two
or
three
times
he
attempted
to
ask
the
favor
which
seemed
such
a
great
one
and
each
time
the
words
stuck
in
his
throat
until
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
should
never
succeed
in
getting
them
out
finally
in
his
despair
he
stammered
out
do
you
think
you
could
find
another
boy
in
this
town
lord
lord
moved
round
sideways
in
order
to
bring
his
crooked
eye
to
bear
squarely
on
toby
and
then
there
was
a
long
interval
of
silence
during
which
time
the
boy
color
rapidly
came
and
went
and
his
heart
beat
very
fast
with
suspense
and
fear
well
what
if
i
could
he
said
at
length
do
you
think
that
trade
is
so
good
i
could
afford
to
keep
two
boys
when
there
is
half
work
enough
for
one
toby
stirred
the
lemonade
with
renewed
activity
as
if
by
this
process
he
was
making
both
it
and
his
courage
stronger
and
said
in
a
low
voice
which
lord
could
scarcely
hear
i
did
think
that
but
you
see
i
ought
to
go
home
for
uncle
will
worry
about
me
an
besides
i
do
like
a
circus
very
again
there
was
silence
on
lord
part
and
again
the
crooked
eye
glowered
down
on
toby
so
he
said
and
toby
could
see
that
his
anger
was
rising
very
fast
you
do
like
a
circus
very
well
an
you
begin
to
think
that
your
uncle
daniel
will
worry
about
you
eh
well
i
want
you
to
understand
that
it
do
make
any
difference
to
me
whether
you
like
a
circus
or
not
and
i
do
care
how
much
your
uncle
daniel
worries
you
mean
that
you
want
to
get
away
from
me
after
i
been
to
all
the
trouble
and
expense
of
teaching
you
the
business
toby
bent
his
head
over
the
pail
and
stirred
away
as
if
for
dear
life
if
you
think
you
going
to
get
away
from
here
until
you
paid
me
for
all
you
eat
an
all
the
time
i
spent
on
you
you
mistaken
that
all
you
had
an
easy
time
with
me
too
easy
in
fact
and
that
what
ails
you
now
you
just
let
me
hear
two
words
more
out
of
your
head
about
going
away
only
two
more
an
i
show
you
what
a
whipping
is
i
only
been
playing
with
you
before
when
you
thought
you
were
getting
a
whipping
but
you
find
out
what
it
means
if
i
so
much
as
see
a
thought
in
your
eyes
about
goin
away
an
do
you
dare
to
try
to
give
me
the
slip
in
the
night
an
run
away
for
if
you
do
follow
you
an
have
you
arrested
now
you
mind
your
eye
in
the
it
is
impossible
to
say
how
much
longer
lord
might
have
continued
this
tirade
had
not
a
member
of
the
company
one
of
the
principal
riders
called
him
to
one
side
to
speak
with
him
poor
toby
was
so
much
confused
by
the
angry
words
which
had
followed
his
very
natural
and
certainly
very
reasonable
suggestion
that
he
paid
no
attention
to
anything
around
him
until
he
heard
his
own
name
mentioned
and
then
fearing
lest
some
new
misfortune
was
about
to
befall
him
he
listened
intently
i
afraid
you
could
do
much
of
anything
with
him
he
heard
lord
say
he
had
enough
of
this
kind
of
life
already
so
he
says
i
expect
the
next
thing
he
does
will
be
to
try
and
run
i
risk
his
getting
away
from
you
job
he
heard
the
other
say
but
of
course
i
got
to
take
my
chances
i
take
him
in
hand
from
eleven
to
twelve
each
day
just
your
slack
time
of
trade
and
i
not
only
give
you
half
of
what
he
can
earn
in
the
next
two
years
but
i
pay
you
for
his
time
if
he
gives
you
the
slip
before
the
season
is
toby
knew
that
they
were
speaking
of
him
but
what
it
all
meant
he
could
not
imagine
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
him
first
job
asked
just
put
him
right
in
the
ring
and
teach
him
what
riding
is
i
tell
you
job
the
boy
smart
enough
and
before
the
season
over
i
have
him
so
that
he
can
do
some
of
the
bareback
acts
and
perhaps
we
get
some
money
out
of
him
before
we
go
into
winter
toby
understood
the
meaning
of
their
conversation
only
too
well
and
he
knew
that
his
lot
which
before
seemed
harder
than
he
could
bear
was
about
to
be
intensified
through
this
castle
of
whom
he
had
frequently
heard
and
who
was
said
to
be
a
rival
of
lord
so
far
as
brutality
went
the
two
men
now
walked
toward
the
large
tent
and
toby
was
left
alone
with
his
thoughts
and
two
or
three
little
boy
customers
who
looked
at
him
wonderingly
and
envied
him
because
he
belonged
to
the
circus
during
the
ride
that
night
he
told
old
ben
what
he
had
heard
confidently
expecting
that
that
friend
at
least
would
console
him
but
ben
was
not
the
champion
which
he
had
expected
the
old
man
who
had
been
with
a
circus
man
and
boy
nigh
to
forty
years
did
not
seem
to
think
it
any
calamity
that
he
was
to
be
taught
to
ride
that
castle
is
a
little
rough
on
boys
old
ben
said
thoughtfully
but
it
be
a
good
thing
for
you
toby
just
so
long
as
you
stay
with
job
you
wo
be
nothin
more
a
candy
boy
but
after
you
know
how
to
ride
it
be
another
thing
an
you
can
earn
a
good
deal
of
money
be
your
own
but
i
do
want
to
stay
with
the
circus
whined
toby
i
do
want
to
learn
to
ride
an
i
do
want
to
get
back
to
uncle
that
may
all

yet
awhile
said
ben
in
a
matter
of
fact
tone
as
he
devoted
his
attention
again
to
his
horses
leaving
toby
to
his
own
sad
reflections
and
the
positive
conviction
that
boys
who
run
away
from
home
do
not
have
a
good
time
except
in
stories
the
next
forenoon
while
toby
was
deep
in
the
excitement
of
selling
to
a
boy
no
larger
than
himself
and
with
just
as
red
hair
three
worth
of
peanuts
and
two
sticks
of
candy
and
while
the
boy
was
trying
to
induce
him
to
throw
in
a
piece
of
gum
because
of
the
quantity
purchased
job
lord
called
him
aside
and
toby
knew
that
his
troubles
had
begun
i
want
you
to
go
in
an
see
castle
he
goin
to
show
you
how
to
ride
said
lord
in
as
kindly
a
tone
as
if
he
were
conferring
some
favor
on
the
boy
if
toby
had
dared
to
he
would
have
rebelled
then
and
there
and
refused
to
go
but
as
he
had
the
courage
for
such
proceeding
he
walked
meekly
into
the
tent
and
toward
the
ring
xiv
castle
teaches
toby
to
ride
when
toby
got
within
sight
of
the
ring
he
was
astonished
at
what
he
saw
a
horse
with
a
broad
wooden
saddle
was
being
led
slowly
around
the
ring
castle
was
standing
on
one
side
with
a
long
whip
in
his
hand
and
on
the
tent
pole
which
stood
in
the
center
of
the
ring
was
a
long
arm
from
which
dangled
a
leathern
belt
attached
to
a
long
rope
that
was
carried
through
the
end
of
the
arm
and
run
down
to
the
base
of
the
pole
toby
knew
well
enough
why
the
horse
the
whip
and
the
man
were
there
but
the
wooden
projection
from
the
tent
pole
which
looked
so
much
like
a
gallows
he
could
not
understand
at
all
come
now
said
castle
cracking
his
whip
ominously
as
toby
came
in
sight
why
were
you
here
before
mr
lord
just
sent
me
in
said
toby
not
expecting
that
his
excuse
would
be
received
for
they
never
had
been
since
he
had
arrived
at
the
height
of
his
ambition
by
joining
the
circus
then
i
make
job
understand
that
i
am
to
have
my
full
hour
of
your
time
and
if
i
do
get
it
there
be
trouble
between
it
would
have
pleased
toby
very
well
to
have
had
castle
go
out
with
his
long
whip
just
then
and
make
trouble
for
lord
but
castle
had
not
the
time
to
spare
because
of
the
trouble
which
he
was
about
to
make
for
toby
and
that
he
commenced
on
at
once
well
get
in
here
and
do
waste
any
more
time
he
said
sharply
toby
looked
around
curiously
for
a
moment
and
not
understanding
exactly
what
he
was
expected
to
get
in
and
do
asked
what
shall
i
do
pull
off
your
boots
coat
and
since
there
was
no
other
course
than
to
learn
to
ride
toby
wisely
concluded
that
the
best
thing
he
could
do
would
be
to
obey
his
new
master
without
question
so
he
began
to
take
off
his
clothes
with
as
much
alacrity
as
if
learning
to
ride
was
the
one
thing
upon
which
he
had
long
set
his
heart
castle
was
evidently
accustomed
to
prompt
obedience
for
he
not
only
took
it
as
a
matter
of
course
but
endeavored
to
hurry
toby
in
the
work
of
undressing
with
his
desire
to
please
and
urged
by
castle
words
and
the
ominous
shaking
of
his
whip
toby
preparations
were
soon
made
and
he
stood
before
his
instructor
clad
only
in
his
shirt
trousers
and
stockings
the
horse
was
led
around
to
where
he
stood
and
when
castle
held
out
his
hand
to
help
him
to
mount
toby
jumped
up
quickly
without
aid
thereby
making
a
good
impression
at
the
start
as
a
willing
lad
now
said
the
instructor
as
he
pulled
down
the
leathern
belt
which
hung
from
the
rope
and
fastened
it
around
toby
waist
stand
up
in
the
saddle
and
try
to
keep
there
you
ca
fall
because
the
rope
will
hold
you
up
even
if
the
horse
goes
out
from
under
you
but
it
hard
work
to
keep
on
if
you
mind
what
you
are
about
and
if
you
this
whip
will
help
you
now
stand
toby
did
as
he
was
bid
and
as
the
horse
was
led
at
a
walk
and
as
he
had
the
long
bridle
to
aid
him
in
keeping
his
footing
he
had
no
difficulty
in
standing
during
the
time
that
the
horse
went
once
around
the
ring
but
that
was
all
castle
seemed
to
think
that
this
was
preparation
enough
for
the
boy
to
be
able
to
understand
how
to
ride
and
he
started
the
horse
into
a
canter
as
might
have
been
expected
toby
lost
his
balance
the
horse
went
on
ahead
and
he
was
left
dangling
at
the
end
of
the
rope
very
much
like
a
crab
that
has
just
been
caught
by
the
means
of
a
pole
and
line
toby
kicked
waved
his
hands
and
floundered
about
generally
but
all
to
no
purpose
until
the
horse
came
round
again
and
then
he
made
frantic
efforts
to
regain
his
footing
which
efforts
were
aided
or
perhaps
it
would
be
more
proper
to
say
retarded
by
the
long
lash
of
whip
that
played
around
his
legs
with
merciless
severity
stand
up
stand
up
cried
his
instructor
as
toby
reeled
first
to
one
side
and
then
to
the
other
now
standing
erect
in
the
saddle
and
now
dangling
at
the
end
of
the
rope
with
the
horse
almost
out
from
under
him
this
command
seemed
needless
as
it
was
exactly
what
toby
was
trying
to
do
but
as
it
was
given
he
struggled
all
the
harder
until
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
more
he
tried
the
less
did
he
succeed
and
this
first
lesson
progressed
in
about
the
same
way
until
the
hour
was
over
save
that
now
and
then
castle
would
give
him
some
good
advice
but
oftener
he
would
twist
the
long
lash
of
the
whip
around
the
boy
legs
with
such
force
that
toby
believed
the
skin
had
been
taken
entirely
off
it
may
have
been
a
relief
to
castle
when
this
first
lesson
was
concluded
and
it
certainly
was
to
toby
for
he
had
had
all
the
teaching
in
horsemanship
that
he
wanted
and
he
thought
with
deepest
sorrow
that
this
would
be
of
daily
occurrence
during
all
the
time
that
he
remained
with
the
circus
as
he
went
out
of
the
tent
he
stopped
to
speak
with
his
friend
the
old
monkey
and
his
troubles
seemed
to
have
increased
when
he
stood
in
front
of
the
cage
calling
mr
stubbs
stubbs
and
the
old
fellow
would
not
even
come
down
from
off
the
lofty
perch
where
he
was
engaged
in
monkey
gymnastics
with
several
younger
companions
it
seemed
to
him
as
he
afterward
told
ben
as
if
stubbs
had
gone
back
on
him
because
he
knew
that
he
was
in
when
he
went
toward
the
booth
lord
looked
at
him
around
the
corner
of
the
canvas
for
it
seemed
to
toby
that
his
employer
could
look
around
a
square
corner
with
much
greater
ease
than
he
could
straight
ahead
with
a
disagreeable
leer
in
his
eye
as
though
he
enjoyed
the
misery
which
he
knew
his
little
clerk
had
just
undergone
can
you
ride
yet
he
asked
mockingly
as
toby
stepped
behind
the
counter
to
attend
to
his
regular
line
of
business
toby
made
no
reply
for
he
knew
that
the
question
was
only
asked
sarcastically
and
not
through
any
desire
for
information
in
a
few
moments
lord
left
him
to
attend
to
the
booth
alone
and
went
into
the
tent
where
toby
rightly
conjectured
he
had
gone
to
question
castle
upon
the
result
of
the
lesson
just
given
that
night
old
ben
asked
him
how
he
had
got
on
while
under
the
teaching
of
castle
and
toby
knowing
that
the
question
was
asked
because
of
the
real
interest
which
ben
had
in
his
welfare
replied
if
i
was
tryin
to
learn
how
to
swing
round
the
ring
strapped
to
a
rope
i
should
say
that
i
got
along
first
rate
but
i
do
know
much
about
the
horse
for
i
was
only
on
his
back
a
little
while
at
a
you
get
over
that
soon
said
old
ben
patronizingly
as
he
patted
him
on
the
back
you
remember
my
words
now
i
say
that
you
got
it
in
you
an
if
you
a
mind
to
take
hold
an
try
to
learn
come
out
on
the
top
of
the
heap
yet
an
be
one
of
the
smartest
riders
they
got
in
this
i
do
want
to
be
a
rider
said
toby
sadly
i
only
want
to
get
back
home
once
more
an
then
you
see
how
much
it
take
to
get
me
away
well
said
ben
quietly
be
that
as
it
may
while
you
here
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
take
hold
an
get
ahead
just
as
fast
as
you
can
it
make
it
a
mighty
sight
easier
for
you
while
you
with
the
show
an
it
wo
spoil
any
of
your
chances
for
runnin
away
whenever
the
time
toby
fully
appreciated
the
truth
of
this
remark
and
he
assured
ben
that
he
should
do
all
in
his
power
to
profit
by
the
instruction
given
and
to
please
this
new
master
who
had
been
placed
over
him
and
with
this
promise
he
lay
back
on
the
seat
and
went
to
sleep
not
to
awaken
until
the
preparations
were
being
made
for
the
entree
into
the
next
town
and
lord
harsh
voice
had
cried
out
his
name
with
no
gentle
tone
several
times
toby
first
lesson
with
castle
was
the
most
pleasant
one
he
had
for
after
the
boy
had
once
been
into
the
ring
his
master
seemed
to
expect
that
he
could
do
everything
which
he
was
told
to
do
and
when
he
failed
in
any
little
particular
the
long
lash
of
the
whip
would
go
curling
around
his
legs
or
arms
until
the
little
fellow
body
and
limbs
were
nearly
covered
with
the
blue
and
black
stripes
for
three
lessons
only
was
the
wooden
upright
used
to
keep
him
from
falling
after
that
he
was
forced
to
ride
standing
erect
on
the
broad
wooden
saddle
or
pad
as
it
is
properly
called
and
whenever
he
lost
his
balance
and
fell
there
was
no
question
asked
as
to
whether
or
not
he
had
hurt
himself
but
he
was
mercilessly
cut
with
the
whip
lord
and
jacobs
gained
very
much
by
comparison
with
castle
in
toby
mind
he
had
thought
that
his
lot
could
not
be
harder
than
it
was
with
them
but
when
he
had
experienced
the
pains
of
two
or
three
of
castle
lessons
in
horsemanship
he
thought
that
he
would
stay
with
the
candy
venders
all
the
season
cheerfully
rather
than
take
six
more
lessons
of
castle
night
after
night
he
fell
asleep
from
the
sheer
exhaustion
of
crying
as
he
had
been
pouring
out
his
woes
in
the
old
monkey
ears
and
laying
his
plans
to
run
away
now
more
than
ever
was
he
anxious
to
get
away
and
yet
each
day
was
taking
him
farther
from
home
and
consequently
necessitating
a
larger
amount
of
money
with
which
to
start
as
old
ben
did
not
give
him
as
much
sympathy
as
toby
thought
he
ought
to
give
for
the
old
man
while
he
would
not
allow
job
lord
to
strike
the
boy
if
he
was
near
thought
it
a
necessary
portion
of
the
education
for
castle
to
lash
him
all
he
had
a
mind
to
he
poured
out
all
his
troubles
in
the
old
monkey
ears
and
kept
him
with
him
from
the
time
he
ceased
work
at
night
until
he
was
obliged
to
commence
again
in
the
morning
the
skeleton
and
his
wife
thought
toby
lot
a
hard
one
and
tried
by
every
means
in
their
power
to
cheer
the
poor
boy
neither
one
of
them
could
say
to
castle
what
they
had
said
to
lord
for
the
rider
was
a
far
different
sort
of
a
person
and
one
whom
they
would
not
be
allowed
to
interfere
with
in
any
way
therefore
poor
toby
was
obliged
to
bear
his
troubles
and
his
whippings
as
best
he
might
with
only
the
thought
to
cheer
him
of
the
time
when
he
could
leave
them
all
by
running
away
but
despite
all
his
troubles
toby
learned
to
ride
faster
than
his
teacher
had
expected
he
would
and
in
three
weeks
he
found
little
or
no
difficulty
in
standing
erect
while
his
horse
went
around
the
ring
at
his
fastest
gait
after
that
had
been
accomplished
his
progress
was
more
rapid
and
he
gave
promise
of
be
coming
a
very
good
rider
a
fact
which
pleased
both
castle
and
lord
very
much
as
they
fancied
that
in
another
year
toby
would
be
the
source
of
a
very
good
income
to
them
the
proprietor
of
the
circus
took
considerable
interest
in
instruction
and
promised
castle
that
mademoiselle
jeannette
and
toby
should
do
an
act
together
in
the
performance
just
as
soon
as
the
latter
was
sufficiently
advanced
the
boy
costume
had
been
changed
after
he
could
ride
without
falling
off
and
now
while
he
was
in
the
ring
he
wore
the
same
as
that
used
by
the
regular
performers
the
little
girl
had
after
it
was
announced
that
she
and
toby
were
to
perform
together
been
an
attentive
observer
during
the
hour
that
toby
was
under
castle
direction
and
she
gave
him
many
suggestions
that
were
far
more
valuable
and
quicker
to
be
acted
upon
than
those
given
by
the
teacher
himself
tomorrow
you
two
will
go
through
the
exercise
together
said
castle
to
toby
and
ella
at
the
close
of
one
of
toby
lessons
after
he
had
become
so
skillful
that
he
could
stand
with
ease
on
the
pad
and
even
advanced
so
far
that
he
could
jump
through
a
hoop
without
falling
more
than
twice
out
of
three
times
the
little
girl
appeared
highly
delighted
by
this
information
and
expressed
her
joy
it
will
be
real
nice
she
said
to
toby
after
castle
had
left
them
alone
i
can
help
you
lots
and
it
wo
be
very
long
before
we
can
do
an
act
all
by
ourselves
in
the
performance
and
then
wo
the
people
clap
their
hands
when
we
come
in
it
be
better
for
you
tomorrow
than
it
will
for
me
said
toby
rubbing
his
legs
sorrowfully
still
feeling
the
sting
of
the
whip
you
see
castle
wo
dare
to
whip
you
an
he
make
it
all
count
on
me
he
knows
lord
likes
to
have
him
whip
but
i
make
any
mistake
said
ella
confidently
and
so
you
wo
have
to
be
whipped
on
my
account
and
while
i
am
on
the
horse
you
ca
be
whipped
for
he
could
do
it
without
whipping
me
so
you
see
you
wo
get
only
half
as
toby
brightened
up
a
little
under
the
influence
of
this
argument
but
his
countenance
fell
again
as
he
thought
that
his
chances
for
getting
away
from
the
circus
were
growing
less
each
day
you
see
i
want
to
get
back
to
uncle
an
guilford
he
said
confidentially
i
do
want
to
stay
here
a
single
ella
opened
her
eyes
in
wide
astonishment
as
she
cried
do
want
to
stay
here
why
do
you
go
home
then
job
lord
wo
let
me
said
toby
wondering
if
it
was
possible
that
his
little
companion
did
not
know
exactly
what
sort
of
a
man
his
master
was
then
he
told
her
after
making
her
give
him
all
kinds
of
promises
including
the
ceremony
of
crossing
her
throat
that
she
would
never
tell
a
single
soul
that
he
had
had
many
thoughts
and
had
formed
all
kinds
of
plans
for
running
away
he
told
her
about
losing
his
money
about
his
friendship
for
the
skeleton
and
the
fat
lady
and
at
last
he
confided
in
her
that
he
was
intending
to
take
the
old
monkey
with
him
when
he
should
make
the
attempt
she
listened
with
the
closest
attention
and
when
he
told
her
that
his
little
hoard
had
now
reached
the
sum
of
seven
dollars
and
ten
cents
almost
as
much
as
he
had
before
she
said
eagerly
i
got
three
little
gold
dollars
in
my
trunk
an
you
shall
have
them
all
they
my
very
own
for
mamma
gave
them
to
me
to
do
just
what
i
wanted
to
with
them
but
i
do
see
how
you
can
take
stubbs
with
you
for
that
would
be
no
it
would
neither
said
toby
stoutly
was
he
give
to
me
to
do
just
as
i
wanted
to
with
an
did
the
boss
say
he
was
all
mine
oh
i
forgotten
that
said
ella
thoughtfully
i
suppose
you
can
take
him
but
he
be
awfully
in
the
way
wo
he
no
said
toby
anxious
to
say
a
good
word
for
his
pet
he
always
does
just
what
i
want
him
to
an
when
i
tell
him
what
i
tryin
to
do
be
as
good
as
anything
but
i
ca
take
your
why
not
that
would
be
right
for
a
boy
to
let
a
girl
littler
than
himself
help
him
i
wait
till
i
get
money
enough
of
my
own
an
then
i
but
i
want
you
to
take
my
money
too
i
want
you
to
have
no
i
ca
take
it
said
toby
shaking
his
head
resolutely
as
he
put
the
golden
temptation
from
him
and
then
as
a
happy
thought
occurred
to
him
he
said
quickly
i
tell
you
what
to
do
with
your
dollars
you
keep
them
till
you
grow
up
to
be
a
woman
an
when
i
a
man
i
come
an
then
we
buy
a
circus
of
our
own
i
think
perhaps
i
like
to
be
with
a
circus
if
i
owned
one
myself
we
have
lots
of
money
then
can
do
just
what
we
want
this
idea
seemed
to
please
the
little
girl
and
the
two
began
to
lay
all
sorts
of
plans
for
that
time
when
they
should
be
man
and
woman
have
lots
of
money
and
be
able
to
do
just
what
they
wanted
to
they
had
been
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
newly
made
ring
while
they
were
talking
and
before
they
had
half
finished
making
plans
for
the
future
one
of
the
attendants
came
in
to
put
things
to
order
and
they
were
obliged
to
leave
their
seats
she
going
to
the
hotel
to
get
ready
for
the
afternoon
performance
and
toby
to
try
to
do
such
work
as
job
had
laid
out
for
him
just
ten
weeks
from
the
time
toby
had
first
joined
the
circus
castle
informed
him
and
ella
that
they
were
to
appear
in
public
on
the
following
day
they
had
been
practicing
daily
and
toby
had
become
so
skillful
that
both
castle
and
lord
saw
that
the
time
had
come
when
he
could
be
made
to
earn
some
money
for
them
xv
toby
friends
present
him
with
a
costume
during
this
time
toby
funds
had
accumulated
rather
slower
than
on
the
first
few
days
he
was
in
the
business
but
he
had
saved
eleven
dollars
and
lord
had
paid
him
five
dollars
of
his
salary
so
that
he
had
the
to
him
enormous
sum
of
sixteen
dollars
and
he
had
about
made
up
his
mind
to
make
one
effort
for
liberty
when
the
news
came
that
he
was
to
ride
in
public
he
had
in
fact
been
ready
to
run
away
any
time
within
the
past
week
but
as
if
they
had
divined
his
intentions
both
castle
and
lord
had
kept
a
very
strict
watch
over
him
one
or
the
other
keeping
him
in
sight
from
the
time
he
got
through
with
his
labors
at
night
until
they
saw
him
on
the
cart
with
old
ben
i
was
just
gettin
ready
to
run
away
said
toby
to
ella
on
the
day
castle
gave
his
decision
as
to
their
taking
part
in
the
performance
and
while
they
were
walking
out
of
the
tent
an
i
should
wonder
now
if
i
got
away
oh
toby
exclaimed
the
girl
as
she
looked
reproachfully
at
him
after
all
the
work
we
had
to
get
ready
you
wo
go
off
and
leave
me
before
we
had
a
chance
to
see
what
the
folks
will
say
when
they
see
us
together
it
was
impossible
for
toby
to
feel
any
delight
at
the
idea
of
riding
in
public
and
he
would
have
been
willing
to
have
taken
one
of
most
severe
whippings
if
he
could
have
escaped
from
it
but
he
and
ella
had
become
such
firm
friends
and
he
had
conceived
such
a
boyish
admiration
for
her
that
he
felt
as
if
he
were
willing
to
bear
almost
anything
for
the
sake
of
giving
her
pleasure
therefore
he
said
after
a
few
moments
reflection
well
i
wo
go
tonight
anyway
even
if
i
have
the
best
chance
that
ever
was
i
stay
one
day
more
anyhow
perhaps
i
have
to
stay
a
good
that
a
nice
boy
said
ella
positively
as
toby
thus
gave
his
decision
and
i
kiss
you
for
before
toby
fully
realized
what
she
was
about
almost
before
he
had
understood
what
she
said
she
had
put
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
given
him
a
good
sound
kiss
right
on
his
freckled
face
toby
was
surprised
astonished
and
just
a
little
bit
ashamed
he
had
never
been
kissed
by
a
girl
before
very
seldom
by
anyone
save
the
fat
lady
and
he
hardly
knew
what
to
do
or
say
he
blushed
until
his
face
was
almost
as
red
as
his
hair
and
this
color
had
the
effect
of
making
his
freckles
stand
out
with
startling
distinctness
then
he
looked
carefully
around
to
see
if
anyone
had
seen
them
i
never
had
a
girl
kiss
me
before
said
toby
hesitatingly
you
see
it
made
me
feel
kinder
queer
to
have
you
do
it
out
here
where
everybody
could
well
i
kissed
you
because
i
like
you
very
much
and
because
you
are
going
to
stay
and
ride
with
me
tomorrow
she
said
positively
and
then
she
added
slyly
i
may
kiss
you
again
if
you
do
get
a
chance
to
run
away
very
i
wish
it
was
for
uncle
an
the
rest
of
the
folks
at
home
there
was
any
such
men
as
lord
an
castle
an
then
i
know
but
i
might
want
to
stay
with
the
circus
i
like
you
awful
and
as
he
spoke
toby
heart
grew
very
tender
toward
the
only
girl
friend
he
had
ever
known
by
this
time
they
had
reached
the
door
of
the
tent
and
as
they
stepped
outside
one
of
the
drivers
told
them
that
mr
treat
and
his
wife
were
very
anxious
to
see
both
of
them
in
their
tent
i
do
believe
i
can
go
said
toby
doubtfully
as
he
glanced
toward
the
booth
where
lord
was
busy
in
attending
to
customers
and
evidently
waiting
for
toby
to
relieve
him
so
that
he
could
go
to
his
dinner
i
do
believe
lord
will
let
go
and
ask
him
said
ella
eagerly
we
wo
be
gone
but
a
toby
approached
his
employer
with
fear
and
trembling
he
had
never
before
asked
leave
to
be
away
from
his
work
even
for
a
moment
and
he
had
no
doubt
but
that
his
request
would
be
refused
with
blows
mr
treat
wants
me
to
come
in
his
tent
for
a
minute
can
i
go
he
asked
in
a
timid
voice
and
in
such
a
low
tone
as
to
render
it
almost
inaudible
lord
looked
at
him
for
an
instant
and
toby
was
sure
that
he
was
making
up
his
mind
whether
to
kick
him
or
catch
him
by
the
collar
and
use
the
rubber
cane
on
him
but
he
had
no
such
intention
evidently
for
he
said
in
a
voice
unusually
mild
yes
an
you
need
come
to
work
again
until
it
time
to
go
into
the
toby
was
almost
alarmed
at
this
unusual
kindness
and
it
puzzled
him
so
much
that
he
would
have
forgotten
he
had
permission
to
go
away
if
ella
had
not
pulled
him
gently
by
the
coat
if
he
had
heard
a
conversation
between
lord
and
castle
that
very
morning
he
would
have
understood
why
it
was
that
lord
had
so
suddenly
become
kind
castle
had
told
job
that
the
boy
had
really
shown
himself
to
be
a
good
rider
and
that
in
order
to
make
him
more
contented
with
his
lot
and
to
keep
him
from
running
away
he
must
be
used
more
kindly
and
perhaps
be
taken
from
the
candy
business
altogether
which
latter
advice
lord
did
not
look
upon
with
favor
because
of
the
large
sales
which
the
boy
made
when
they
reached
the
skeleton
tent
they
found
to
their
surprise
that
no
exhibition
was
being
given
at
that
hour
and
ella
said
with
some
concern
how
queer
it
is
that
the
doors
are
not
open
i
do
hope
that
they
are
not
toby
felt
a
strange
sinking
at
his
heart
as
the
possibility
suggested
itself
that
one
or
both
of
his
kind
friends
might
be
ill
for
they
had
both
been
so
kind
and
attentive
to
him
that
he
had
learned
to
love
them
very
dearly
but
the
fears
of
both
the
children
were
dispelled
when
they
tried
to
get
in
at
the
door
and
were
met
with
the
smiling
skeleton
himself
who
said
as
he
threw
the
canvas
aside
as
far
as
if
he
were
admitting
his
own
enormous
lilly
come
in
my
friends
come
in
i
have
had
the
exhibition
closed
for
one
hour
in
order
that
i
might
show
my
appreciation
of
my
friend
toby
looked
around
in
some
alarm
fearing
that
mr
treat
friendship
was
about
to
be
displayed
in
one
of
his
state
dinners
which
he
had
learned
to
fear
rather
than
enjoy
but
as
he
saw
no
preparations
for
dinner
he
breathed
more
freely
and
wondered
what
all
this
ceremony
could
possibly
mean
neither
he
nor
ella
was
long
left
in
doubt
for
as
soon
as
they
had
entered
mrs
treat
waddled
from
behind
the
screen
which
served
them
as
a
dressing
room
with
a
bundle
in
her
arms
which
she
handed
to
her
husband
he
took
it
and
quickly
mounting
the
platform
leaving
ella
and
toby
below
he
commenced
to
speak
with
very
many
flourishes
of
his
thin
arms
my
friends
he
began
as
he
looked
down
upon
his
audience
of
three
who
were
listening
in
the
following
attitudes
ella
and
toby
were
standing
upon
the
ground
at
the
foot
of
the
platform
looking
up
with
wide
open
staring
eyes
and
his
fleshy
wife
was
seated
on
a
bench
which
had
evidently
been
placed
in
such
a
position
below
the
speaker
stand
that
she
could
hear
and
see
all
that
was
going
on
without
the
fatigue
of
standing
up
which
for
one
of
her
size
was
really
very
hard
work
my
friends
repeated
the
skeleton
as
he
held
his
bundle
in
front
of
him
with
one
hand
and
gesticulated
with
the
other
we
all
of
us
know
that
tomorrow
our
esteemed
and
worthy
friend
toby
tyler
makes
his
first
appearance
in
any
ring
and
we
all
of
us
believe
that
he
will
soon
become
a
bright
and
shining
light
in
the
profession
which
he
is
so
soon
to
the
speaker
was
here
interrupted
by
loud
applause
from
his
wife
and
he
profited
by
the
opportunity
to
wipe
a
stray
drop
of
perspiration
from
his
fleshless
face
then
as
the
fat
lady
ceased
the
exertion
of
clapping
her
hands
he
continued
knowing
that
our
friend
tyler
was
being
instructed
preparatory
to
dazzling
the
public
with
his
talents
my
wife
and
i
began
to
prepare
for
him
some
slight
testimonial
of
our
esteem
and
being
informed
by
castle
some
days
ago
of
the
day
on
which
he
was
to
make
his
first
appearance
before
the
public
we
were
enabled
to
complete
our
little
gift
in
time
for
the
great
and
important
here
the
skeleton
paused
to
take
a
breath
and
toby
began
to
grow
more
uncomfortably
red
in
the
face
such
praise
made
him
feel
very
awkward
i
hold
in
this
bundle
continued
mr
treat
as
he
waved
the
package
on
high
a
costume
for
our
bold
and
worthy
equestrian
and
a
sash
to
match
for
his
beautiful
and
accomplished
companion
in
presenting
these
little
tokens
my
wife
who
has
embroidered
every
inch
of
the
velvet
herself
and
i
feel
proud
to
know
that
when
the
great
and
auspicious
occasion
occurs
tomorrow
the
worthy
tyler
will
step
into
the
ring
in
a
costume
which
we
have
prepared
expressly
for
him
and
thus
when
he
does
himself
honor
by
his
performance
and
earns
the
applause
of
the
multitude
he
will
be
doing
honor
and
doing
applause
for
the
work
of
our
hands
my
wife
lilly
and
myself
take
them
my
boy
and
when
you
array
yourself
in
them
tomorrow
you
will
remember
that
the
only
living
skeleton
and
the
wonder
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
the
shape
of
the
mammoth
lady
are
present
in
their
works
if
not
in
their
as
he
finished
speaking
mr
treat
handed
the
bundle
to
toby
and
then
joined
in
the
applause
which
was
being
given
by
mrs
treat
and
ella
toby
unrolled
the
package
and
found
that
it
contained
a
circus
costume
of
pink
tights
and
blue
velvet
trunks
collar
and
cuffs
embroidered
in
white
and
plentifully
spangled
with
silver
in
addition
was
a
wide
blue
sash
for
ella
embroidered
to
correspond
with
costume
the
little
fellow
was
both
delighted
with
the
gift
and
at
a
loss
to
know
what
to
say
in
response
he
looked
at
the
costume
over
and
over
again
and
the
tears
of
gratitude
that
these
friends
should
have
been
so
good
to
him
came
into
his
eyes
he
saw
however
that
they
were
expecting
him
to
say
something
in
reply
and
laying
the
gift
on
the
platform
he
said
to
the
skeleton
and
his
wife
you
been
so
good
to
me
ever
since
i
been
with
the
circus
that
i
wish
i
was
big
enough
to
say
somethin
more
than
that
i
much
obliged
but
i
ca
one
of
these
days
when
i
a
man
i
show
you
how
much
i
like
you
an
then
you
wo
be
sorry
that
you
was
good
to
such
a
poor
little
runaway
boy
as
i
here
the
skeleton
broke
in
with
such
loud
applause
and
so
many
cries
of
hear
hear
that
toby
grew
still
more
confused
and
forgot
entirely
what
he
was
intending
to
say
next
i
want
you
to
know
how
much
obliged
i
am
he
said
after
much
hesitation
an
when
i
wear
i
ride
just
the
best
i
know
how
even
if
i
do
want
to
an
you
be
sorry
that
you
gave
them
to
as
toby
concluded
he
made
a
funny
little
awkward
bow
and
then
seemed
to
be
trying
to
hide
himself
behind
a
chair
from
the
applause
which
was
given
so
generously
bless
your
dear
little
heart
said
the
fat
lady
after
the
confusion
had
somewhat
subsided
i
know
you
will
do
your
best
anyway
and
i
glad
to
know
that
you
going
to
make
your
first
appearance
in
something
that
samuel
and
i
made
for
ella
was
quite
as
well
pleased
with
her
sash
as
toby
was
with
his
costume
and
thanked
and
mrs
treat
in
a
pretty
little
way
that
made
toby
wish
he
could
say
anything
half
so
nicely
the
hour
which
the
skeleton
had
devoted
for
the
purpose
of
the
presentation
and
accompanying
speeches
having
elapsed
it
was
necessary
that
ella
and
toby
should
go
and
that
the
doors
of
the
exhibition
be
opened
at
once
in
order
to
give
any
of
the
public
an
opportunity
of
seeing
what
the
placards
announced
as
two
of
the
greatest
curiosities
on
the
face
of
the
globe
that
day
while
toby
performed
his
arduous
labors
his
heart
was
very
light
for
the
evidences
which
the
skeleton
and
his
wife
had
given
of
their
regard
for
him
were
very
gratifying
he
determined
that
he
would
do
his
very
best
to
please
so
long
as
he
was
with
the
circus
and
then
when
he
got
a
chance
to
run
away
he
would
do
so
but
not
until
he
had
said
goodby
to
and
mrs
treat
and
thanked
them
again
for
their
interest
in
him
when
he
had
finished
his
work
in
the
tent
that
night
lord
said
to
him
as
he
patted
him
on
the
back
in
the
most
fatherly
fashion
and
as
if
he
had
never
spoken
a
harsh
word
to
him
you
ca
come
in
here
to
sell
candy
now
that
you
are
one
of
the
performers
my
boy
an
if
i
can
find
another
boy
tomorrow
you
wo
have
to
work
in
the
booth
any
longer
an
your
salary
of
a
dollar
a
week
will
go
on
just
the
same
even
if
you
do
have
anything
to
do
but
to
this
was
a
bit
of
news
that
was
as
welcome
to
toby
as
it
was
unexpected
and
he
felt
more
happy
then
than
he
had
for
the
ten
weeks
that
he
had
been
traveling
under
lord
cruel
mastership
but
there
was
one
thing
that
night
that
rather
damped
his
joy
and
that
was
that
he
noticed
that
lord
was
unusually
careful
to
watch
him
not
even
allowing
him
to
go
outside
the
tent
without
following
he
saw
at
once
that
if
he
was
to
have
a
more
easy
time
his
chances
for
running
away
were
greatly
diminished
and
no
number
of
beautiful
costumes
would
have
made
him
content
to
stay
with
the
circus
one
moment
longer
than
was
absolutely
necessary
that
night
he
told
old
ben
the
events
of
the
day
and
expressed
the
hope
that
he
might
acquit
himself
creditably
when
he
made
his
first
appearance
on
the
following
day
ben
sat
thoughtfully
for
some
time
and
then
making
all
the
preparations
which
toby
knew
so
well
signified
a
long
bit
of
advice
he
said
toby
my
boy
i
been
with
a
circus
man
an
boy
nigh
to
forty
years
an
i
seen
lots
of
youngsters
start
in
just
as
you
re
goin
to
start
in
tomorrow
but
the
most
of
them
petered
out
because
they
got
to
knowin
more
them
that
learned
did
now
you
remember
what
i
say
an
you
find
it
good
advice
whatever
business
you
get
into
think
you
know
all
about
it
before
you
begun
remember
that
you
can
always
learn
somethin
no
matter
how
old
you
are
an
keep
your
eyes
an
ears
open
an
your
tongue
between
your
teeth
an
you
amount
to
somethin
or
my
name
hai
xvi
toby
first
appearance
in
the
ring
when
the
circus
entered
the
town
which
had
been
selected
as
the
place
where
toby
was
to
make
his
debut
as
a
circus
rider
the
boy
noticed
a
new
poster
among
the
many
glaring
and
gaudy
bills
which
set
forth
the
varied
and
numerous
attractions
that
were
to
be
found
under
one
canvas
for
a
trifling
admission
fee
and
he
noticed
it
with
some
degree
of
interest
not
thinking
for
a
moment
that
it
had
any
reference
to
him
it
was
printed
very
much
as
follows
mademoiselle
jeannette
and
monsieur
ajax
two
of
the
youngest
equestrians
in
the
world
will
perform
their
graceful
dashing
and
daring
act
entitled
the
triumph
of
the
innocents
this
is
the
first
appearance
of
these
daring
young
riders
together
since
their
separation
in
europe
last
season
and
their
performance
in
this
town
will
have
a
new
and
novel
interest
see
mademoiselle
jeannette
and
monsieur
ajax
look
there
said
toby
to
ben
as
he
pointed
out
the
poster
which
was
printed
in
very
large
letters
with
gorgeous
coloring
and
surmounted
by
a
picture
of
two
very
small
people
performing
all
kinds
of
impossible
feats
on
horseback
they
got
someone
else
to
ride
with
ella
today
i
wonder
who
it
can
be
ben
looked
at
toby
for
a
moment
as
if
to
assure
himself
that
the
boy
was
in
earnest
in
asking
the
question
and
then
he
relapsed
into
the
worst
fit
of
silent
laughing
that
toby
had
ever
seen
after
he
had
quite
recovered
he
asked
do
you
know
who
monsieur
ajax
is
hai
you
never
seen
him
no
replied
toby
at
a
loss
to
understand
what
there
was
so
very
funny
in
his
very
natural
question
i
thought
that
i
was
goin
to
ride
with
why
that
you
almost
screamed
ben
in
delight
monsieur
ajax
means
you
did
you
know
it
you
do
suppose
they
would
go
to
put
tyler
on
the
bills
do
you
how
it
would
look
jeannette
an
monsieur
toby
tyler
ben
was
off
in
one
of
his
laughing
spells
again
and
toby
sat
there
stiff
and
straight
hardly
knowing
whether
to
join
in
the
mirth
or
to
get
angry
at
the
sport
which
had
been
made
of
his
name
i
do
care
he
said
at
length
i
sure
i
think
toby
tyler
sounds
just
as
well
as
monsieur
ajax
an
i
sure
it
fits
me
a
good
deal
that
may
be
said
ben
soothingly
but
you
see
it
would
go
down
so
well
with
the
public
they
want
furrin
riders
an
they
must
have
even
if
it
does
spoil
your
despite
the
fact
that
he
did
not
like
the
new
name
that
had
been
given
him
toby
could
not
but
feel
pleased
at
the
glowing
terms
in
which
his
performance
was
set
off
but
he
did
not
at
all
relish
the
lie
that
was
told
about
his
having
been
with
ella
in
europe
and
he
would
have
been
very
much
better
pleased
if
that
portion
of
it
had
been
left
off
during
the
forenoon
he
did
not
go
near
lord
nor
his
candy
stand
for
castle
kept
him
and
ella
busily
engaged
in
practicing
the
feat
which
they
were
to
perform
in
the
afternoon
and
it
was
almost
time
for
the
performance
to
begin
before
they
were
allowed
even
to
go
to
their
dinner
ella
who
had
performed
several
years
was
very
much
more
excited
over
the
coming
debut
than
toby
was
and
the
reason
why
he
did
not
show
more
interest
was
probably
because
of
his
great
desire
to
leave
the
circus
as
soon
as
possible
and
during
that
forenoon
he
thought
very
much
more
of
how
he
should
get
back
to
guilford
and
uncle
daniel
than
he
did
of
how
he
should
get
along
when
he
stood
before
the
audience
castle
assisted
his
pupil
to
dress
and
when
that
was
done
to
his
entire
satisfaction
he
said
in
a
stern
voice
now
you
can
do
this
act
all
right
and
if
you
slip
up
on
it
and
do
do
it
as
you
ought
to
i
give
you
such
a
whipping
when
you
come
out
of
the
ring
that
think
job
was
only
fooling
with
you
when
he
tried
to
whip
toby
had
been
feeling
reasonably
cheerful
before
this
but
these
words
dispelled
all
his
cheerful
thoughts
and
he
was
looking
more
disconsolate
when
old
ben
came
into
the
dressing
tent
all
ready
are
you
my
boy
said
the
old
man
in
his
cheeriest
voice
well
that
good
an
you
look
as
nice
as
possible
now
remember
what
i
told
you
last
night
toby
an
go
in
there
to
do
your
level
best
make
a
name
for
yourself
come
out
here
with
me
and
wait
for
the
young
these
cheering
words
of
ben
did
toby
as
much
good
as
castle
had
the
reverse
and
as
he
stepped
out
of
the
dressing
room
to
the
place
where
the
horses
were
being
saddled
toby
resolved
that
he
would
do
his
very
best
that
afternoon
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
please
his
old
friend
toby
was
not
naturally
what
might
be
called
a
pretty
boy
for
his
short
red
hair
and
his
freckled
face
prevented
any
great
display
of
beauty
but
he
was
a
good
honest
looking
boy
and
in
his
tasteful
costume
looked
very
nice
indeed
so
nice
that
could
mrs
treat
have
seen
him
just
then
she
would
have
been
very
proud
of
her
handiwork
and
hugged
him
harder
than
ever
he
had
been
waiting
but
a
few
moments
when
ella
came
from
her
dressing
room
and
toby
was
much
pleased
when
he
saw
by
the
expression
of
her
face
that
she
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
his
appearance
we
both
do
just
as
well
as
we
can
she
whispered
to
him
and
i
know
the
people
will
like
us
and
make
us
come
back
after
we
get
through
and
if
they
do
mamma
says
she
give
each
one
of
us
a
gold
she
had
taken
hold
of
toby
hand
as
she
spoke
and
her
manner
was
so
earnest
and
anxious
that
toby
was
more
excited
than
he
ever
had
been
about
his
debut
and
had
he
gone
into
the
ring
just
at
that
moment
the
chances
are
that
he
would
have
surprised
even
his
teacher
by
his
riding
i
do
just
as
well
as
i
can
said
toby
in
reply
to
his
little
companion
an
if
we
earn
the
dollars
i
have
a
hole
bored
in
mine
an
you
shall
wear
it
around
your
neck
to
remember
me
i
remember
you
without
that
she
whispered
and
i
give
you
mine
so
that
you
shall
have
so
much
the
more
when
you
go
to
your
there
was
no
time
for
further
conversation
for
castle
entered
just
then
to
tell
them
that
they
must
go
in
in
another
moment
the
horses
were
all
ready
a
black
one
for
toby
and
a
white
one
for
ella
and
they
stood
champing
their
bits
and
pawing
the
earth
in
their
impatience
until
the
silver
bells
with
which
they
were
decorated
rang
out
quick
nervous
little
chimes
that
accorded
very
well
with
toby
feelings
ella
squeezed
toby
hand
as
they
stood
waiting
for
the
curtain
to
be
raised
that
they
might
enter
and
he
had
just
time
to
return
it
when
the
signal
was
given
and
almost
before
he
was
aware
of
it
they
were
standing
in
the
ring
kissing
their
hands
to
the
crowds
that
packed
the
enormous
tent
to
its
utmost
capacity
thanks
to
the
false
announcement
about
the
separation
of
the
children
in
europe
and
their
reunion
in
this
particular
town
the
applause
was
long
and
loud
and
before
it
had
died
away
toby
had
time
to
recover
a
little
from
the
queer
feeling
which
this
sea
of
heads
gave
him
he
had
never
seen
such
a
crowd
before
except
as
he
had
seen
them
as
he
walked
around
at
the
foot
of
the
seats
and
then
they
had
simply
looked
like
so
many
human
beings
but
as
he
saw
them
now
from
the
ring
they
appeared
like
strange
rows
of
heads
without
bodies
and
he
had
hard
work
to
keep
from
running
back
behind
the
curtain
whence
he
had
come
castle
acted
as
the
ringmaster
this
time
and
after
he
had
introduced
them
very
much
after
the
fashion
of
the
posters
and
the
clown
had
repeated
some
funny
joke
the
horses
were
led
in
and
they
were
assisted
to
mount
do
mind
the
people
at
all
said
castle
in
a
low
voice
but
ride
just
as
if
you
were
alone
here
with
the
music
struck
up
the
horses
cantered
around
the
ring
and
toby
had
really
started
as
a
circus
rider
remember
said
ella
to
him
in
a
low
tone
just
as
the
horses
started
you
told
me
that
you
would
ride
just
as
well
as
you
could
and
we
must
earn
the
dollars
mamma
it
seemed
to
toby
at
first
as
if
he
could
not
stand
up
but
by
the
time
they
had
ridden
around
the
ring
once
and
ella
had
again
cautioned
him
against
making
any
mistake
for
the
sake
of
the
money
which
they
were
going
to
earn
he
was
calm
and
collected
enough
to
carry
out
his
part
of
the
act
as
well
as
if
he
had
been
simply
taking
a
lesson
the
act
consisted
in
their
riding
side
by
side
jumping
over
banners
and
through
hoops
covered
with
paper
and
then
the
most
difficult
portion
began
the
saddles
were
taken
off
the
horses
and
they
were
to
ride
first
on
one
horse
and
then
on
the
other
until
they
concluded
their
performance
by
riding
twice
around
the
ring
side
by
side
standing
on
their
horses
each
one
with
a
hand
on
the
other
shoulder
all
this
was
successfully
accomplished
without
a
single
error
and
when
they
rode
out
of
the
ring
the
applause
was
so
great
as
to
leave
no
doubt
but
that
they
would
be
recalled
and
thus
earn
the
promised
money
in
fact
they
had
hardly
got
inside
the
curtain
when
one
of
the
attendants
called
to
them
and
before
they
had
time
even
to
speak
to
each
other
they
were
in
the
ring
again
repeating
the
last
portion
of
their
act
when
they
came
out
of
the
ring
for
the
second
time
they
found
old
ben
the
skeleton
the
fat
lady
and
job
lord
waiting
to
welcome
them
but
before
anyone
could
say
a
word
ella
had
stood
on
tiptoe
again
and
given
toby
just
such
another
kiss
as
she
did
when
he
told
her
that
he
would
surely
stay
long
enough
to
appear
in
the
ring
with
her
once
that
because
you
rode
so
well
and
helped
me
so
much
she
said
as
she
saw
toby
cheeks
growing
a
fiery
red
and
then
she
turned
to
those
who
were
waiting
to
greet
her
mrs
treat
took
her
in
her
enormous
arms
and
having
kissed
her
put
her
down
quickly
and
clasped
toby
as
if
he
had
been
a
very
small
walnut
and
her
arms
a
very
large
pair
of
nutcrackers
bless
the
boy
she
exclaimed
as
she
kissed
him
again
and
again
with
an
energy
and
force
that
made
her
kisses
sound
like
the
crack
of
the
whip
and
caused
the
horses
to
stamp
in
affright
i
knew
he
amount
to
something
one
of
these
days
an
samuel
an
i
had
to
come
out
when
business
was
dull
just
to
see
how
he
got
it
was
some
time
before
she
would
unloose
him
from
her
motherly
embrace
and
when
she
did
the
skeleton
grasped
him
by
the
hand
and
said
in
the
most
pompous
and
affected
manner
mr
tyler
we
proud
of
you
and
when
we
saw
that
costume
of
yours
that
my
lilly
embroidered
with
her
own
hands
we
was
both
proud
of
it
and
what
it
contained
you
a
great
rider
my
boy
a
great
rider
and
you
stand
at
the
head
of
the
profession
some
day
if
you
only
stick
to
thank
you
sir
was
all
toby
had
time
to
say
before
old
ben
had
him
by
the
hand
and
the
skeleton
was
pouring
out
his
congratulations
in
little
miss
ella
ear
toby
my
boy
you
did
well
an
now
you
amount
to
something
if
you
only
remember
what
i
told
you
last
night
said
ben
as
he
looked
upon
the
boy
whom
he
had
come
to
think
of
as
his
protege
with
pride
i
never
seen
anybody
of
your
age
do
any
better
an
now
instead
of
only
a
candy
peddler
you
one
of
the
stars
of
the
thank
you
ben
was
all
that
toby
could
say
for
he
knew
that
his
old
friend
meant
every
word
that
he
said
and
it
pleased
him
so
much
that
he
could
say
no
more
than
thank
you
in
reply
i
feel
as
if
your
triumph
was
mine
said
lord
looking
benignly
at
toby
from
out
his
crooked
eye
and
assuming
the
most
fatherly
tone
at
his
command
i
have
learned
to
look
upon
you
almost
as
my
own
son
and
your
success
is
very
gratifying
to
toby
was
not
at
all
flattered
by
this
last
praise
if
he
had
never
seen
lord
before
he
might
and
probably
would
have
been
deceived
by
his
words
but
he
had
seen
him
too
often
and
under
too
many
painful
circumstances
to
be
at
all
swindled
by
his
words
toby
was
very
much
pleased
with
his
success
and
by
the
praise
he
received
from
all
and
when
the
proprietor
of
the
circus
came
along
patted
him
on
the
head
and
told
him
that
he
rode
very
nicely
he
was
quite
happy
until
he
chanced
to
see
the
greedy
twinkle
in
eye
and
then
he
knew
that
all
this
success
and
all
this
praise
were
only
binding
him
faster
to
the
show
which
he
was
so
anxious
to
escape
from
his
pleasure
vanished
very
quickly
and
in
its
stead
came
a
bitter
homesick
feeling
which
no
amount
of
praise
could
banish
it
was
old
ben
who
helped
him
to
undress
after
the
skeleton
and
the
fat
lady
had
gone
to
their
tent
and
ella
had
gone
to
dress
for
her
appearance
with
her
mother
for
now
she
was
obliged
to
ride
twice
at
each
performance
when
toby
was
in
ordinary
clothes
again
ben
said
now
that
you
one
of
the
performers
toby
you
wo
have
to
sell
candy
any
more
an
you
have
the
most
of
your
time
to
yourself
so
let
you
an
i
go
out
an
see
the
do
you
lord
expects
me
to
go
to
work
for
him
again
today
an
he
does
said
ben
with
a
chuckle
you
do
the
boss
would
let
any
one
that
rides
in
the
ring
stand
behind
job
counter
do
you
you
can
do
just
as
you
have
a
mind
to
my
boy
an
i
say
to
you
let
go
out
an
see
the
town
what
do
you
say
to
it
i
like
to
go
first
rate
if
i
dared
to
replied
toby
thinking
of
the
many
whippings
he
had
received
for
far
less
than
that
which
ben
now
proposed
he
should
do
oh
i
take
care
that
job
do
bother
you
so
come
along
and
ben
started
out
of
the
tent
and
toby
followed
feeling
considerably
frightened
at
this
first
act
of
disobedience
against
his
old
master
xvii
off
for
home
during
this
walk
toby
learned
many
things
that
were
of
importance
to
him
so
far
as
his
plan
for
running
away
was
concerned
in
the
first
place
he
gleaned
from
the
railway
posters
that
were
stuck
up
in
the
hotel
to
which
they
went
that
he
could
buy
a
ticket
for
guilford
for
seven
dollars
and
also
that
by
going
back
to
the
town
from
which
they
had
come
he
could
go
to
guilford
by
steamer
for
five
dollars
by
returning
to
this
last
town
and
toby
calculated
that
the
fare
on
the
stage
back
there
could
not
be
more
than
a
dollar
he
would
have
ten
dollars
left
and
that
surely
ought
to
be
sufficient
to
buy
food
enough
for
two
days
for
the
most
hungry
boy
that
ever
lived
when
they
returned
to
the
circus
grounds
the
performance
was
over
and
lord
in
the
midst
of
the
brisk
trade
which
he
usually
had
after
the
afternoon
performance
and
yet
so
far
from
scolding
toby
for
going
away
he
actually
smiled
and
bowed
at
him
as
he
saw
him
go
by
with
ben
see
there
toby
said
the
old
driver
to
the
boy
as
he
gave
him
a
vigorous
poke
in
the
ribs
and
then
went
off
into
one
of
his
dreadful
laughing
spells
see
what
it
is
to
be
a
performer
an
not
workin
for
such
an
old
fossil
as
job
is
he
be
so
sweet
to
you
now
that
sugar
wo
melt
in
his
mouth
an
there
no
chance
of
his
ever
attemptin
to
whip
you
toby
made
no
reply
for
he
was
too
busily
engaged
thinking
of
something
which
had
just
come
into
his
mind
to
know
that
his
friend
had
spoken
but
as
old
ben
hardly
knew
whether
the
boy
had
answered
him
or
not
owing
to
his
being
obliged
to
struggle
with
his
breath
lest
he
should
lose
it
in
the
second
laughing
spell
that
attacked
him
the
thoughtfulness
was
not
particularly
noticed
toby
walked
around
the
show
grounds
for
a
little
while
with
his
old
friend
and
then
the
two
went
to
supper
where
toby
performed
quite
as
great
wonders
in
the
way
of
eating
as
he
had
in
the
afternoon
by
riding
as
soon
as
the
supper
was
over
he
quietly
slipped
away
from
old
ben
and
at
once
paid
a
visit
to
and
mrs
treat
whom
he
found
cozily
engaged
in
their
supper
behind
the
screen
they
welcomed
toby
most
cordially
and
despite
his
assertions
that
he
had
just
finished
a
very
hearty
meal
the
fat
lady
made
him
sit
down
to
the
box
which
served
as
table
and
insisted
on
his
trying
some
of
her
doughnuts
under
all
these
pressing
attentions
it
was
some
time
before
toby
found
a
chance
to
say
that
which
he
had
come
to
say
and
when
he
did
he
was
almost
at
a
loss
how
to
proceed
but
at
last
he
commenced
by
starting
abruptly
on
his
subject
with
the
words
i
made
up
my
mind
to
leave
leave
tonight
repeated
the
skeleton
inquiringly
not
for
a
moment
believing
that
toby
could
think
of
running
away
after
the
brilliant
success
he
had
just
made
what
do
you
mean
toby
why
you
know
that
i
been
wantin
to
get
away
from
the
circus
said
toby
a
little
impatient
that
his
friend
should
be
so
wonderfully
stupid
an
i
think
that
i
have
as
good
a
chance
now
as
ever
i
shall
so
i
goin
to
try
bless
us
exclaimed
the
fat
lady
in
a
gasping
way
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
goin
off
just
when
you
started
in
the
business
so
well
i
thought
you
want
to
stay
after
you
been
so
well
received
this
no
said
toby
and
one
quick
little
sob
popped
right
up
from
his
heart
and
out
before
he
was
aware
of
it
i
learned
to
ride
because
i
had
to
but
i
never
give
up
runnin
away
i
must
see
uncle
an
tell
him
how
sorry
i
am
for
what
i
did
an
if
he
wo
have
anything
to
say
to
me
i
come
back
but
if
he
let
me
i
stay
there
an
i
be
so
good
that
by
by
he
forget
that
i
run
off
an
left
him
without
sayin
a
there
was
such
a
touch
of
sorrow
in
his
tones
so
much
pathos
in
his
way
of
speaking
that
good
mrs
treat
heart
was
touched
at
once
and
putting
her
arms
around
the
little
fellow
as
if
to
shield
him
from
some
harm
she
said
tenderly
and
so
you
shall
go
toby
my
boy
but
if
you
ever
want
a
home
or
anybody
to
love
you
come
right
here
to
us
and
you
never
be
sorry
so
long
as
sam
keeps
thin
and
i
fat
enough
to
draw
the
public
you
never
need
say
that
you
homeless
for
nothing
would
please
us
better
than
to
have
you
come
to
live
with
for
reply
toby
raised
his
head
and
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
a
proceeding
which
caused
her
to
squeeze
him
harder
than
ever
during
this
conversation
the
skeleton
had
remained
very
thoughtful
after
a
moment
or
two
he
got
up
from
his
seat
went
outside
the
tent
and
presently
returned
with
a
quantity
of
silver
ten
cent
pieces
in
his
hand
here
toby
he
said
and
it
was
to
be
seen
that
he
was
really
too
much
affected
even
to
attempt
one
of
his
speeches
it
right
that
you
should
go
for
i
known
what
it
is
to
feel
just
as
you
do
what
lilly
said
about
your
having
a
home
with
us
i
say
an
here
five
dollars
that
i
want
you
to
take
to
help
you
at
first
toby
stoutly
refused
to
take
the
money
but
they
both
insisted
to
such
a
degree
that
he
was
actually
forced
to
and
then
he
stood
up
to
go
i
goin
to
try
to
slip
off
after
job
packs
up
the
outside
booth
if
i
can
he
said
an
it
was
to
say
goodby
that
i
come
around
again
mrs
treat
took
the
boy
in
her
arms
as
if
it
were
one
of
her
own
children
who
was
leaving
her
and
as
she
stroked
his
hair
back
from
his
forehead
she
said
do
forget
us
toby
even
if
you
never
do
see
us
again
try
an
remember
how
much
we
cared
for
you
an
how
much
comfort
you
taking
away
from
us
when
you
go
for
it
was
a
comfort
to
see
you
around
even
if
you
was
with
us
very
much
do
forget
us
toby
if
you
ever
get
the
chance
come
an
see
us
goodby
toby
and
the
kind
hearted
woman
kissed
him
again
and
again
and
then
turned
her
back
resolutely
upon
him
lest
it
should
be
bad
luck
to
him
if
she
again
saw
him
after
saying
goodby
the
skeleton
parting
was
not
quite
so
demonstrative
he
clasped
hand
with
one
set
of
his
fleshless
fingers
while
with
the
other
he
wiped
one
or
two
suspicious
looking
drops
of
moisture
from
his
eyes
as
he
said
i
hope
you
get
along
all
right
my
boy
and
i
believe
you
will
you
will
get
home
to
uncle
daniel
and
be
happier
than
ever
for
now
you
know
what
it
is
to
be
entirely
without
a
home
be
a
good
boy
mind
your
uncle
go
to
school
and
one
of
these
days
you
make
a
good
man
goodby
my
the
tears
were
now
streaming
down
toby
face
very
rapidly
he
had
not
known
in
his
anxiety
to
get
home
how
very
much
he
cared
for
this
strangely
assorted
couple
and
now
it
made
him
feel
very
miserable
and
wretched
that
he
was
going
to
leave
them
he
tried
to
say
something
more
but
the
tears
choked
his
utterance
and
he
left
the
tent
quickly
to
prevent
himself
from
breaking
down
entirely
in
order
that
his
grief
might
not
be
noticed
and
the
cause
of
it
suspected
toby
went
out
behind
the
tent
and
sitting
there
on
a
stone
he
gave
way
to
the
tears
which
he
could
no
longer
control
while
he
was
thus
engaged
heeding
nothing
which
passed
around
him
he
was
startled
by
a
cheery
voice
which
cried
halloo
down
in
the
dumps
again
what
is
the
matter
now
my
bold
equestrian
looking
up
he
saw
ben
standing
before
him
and
he
wiped
his
eyes
hastily
for
here
was
another
from
whom
he
must
part
and
to
whom
a
goodby
must
be
spoken
looking
around
to
make
sure
that
no
one
was
within
hearing
he
went
up
very
close
to
the
old
driver
and
said
in
almost
a
whisper
i
was
feelin
bad
i
just
come
from
and
mrs
treat
an
i
been
sayin
goodby
to
them
i
goin
to
run
away
ben
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
as
if
he
doubted
whether
the
boy
knew
exactly
what
he
was
talking
about
and
then
said
so
you
still
want
to
go
home
do
you
oh
yes
ben
so
much
was
the
reply
in
a
tone
which
expressed
how
dear
to
him
was
the
thought
of
being
in
his
old
home
once
more
all
right
my
boy
i
wo
say
one
word
it
though
it
do
seem
too
bad
after
you
turned
out
to
be
such
a
good
rider
said
the
old
man
thoughtfully
it
better
for
you
i
know
for
a
circus
hai
no
place
for
a
boy
even
if
he
wants
to
stay
an
i
ca
say
but
i
glad
you
still
determined
to
toby
felt
relieved
at
the
tone
of
this
leave
taking
he
had
feared
that
old
ben
who
thought
a
circus
rider
was
almost
on
the
topmost
round
of
fortune
ladder
would
have
urged
him
to
stay
since
he
had
made
his
debut
in
the
ring
and
he
was
almost
afraid
that
he
might
take
some
steps
to
prevent
his
going
i
wanted
to
say
goodby
now
said
toby
in
a
choking
voice
perhaps
i
see
you
again
goodby
my
boy
said
ben
as
he
took
the
boy
hand
in
his
forget
this
experience
you
had
in
runnin
away
an
if
ever
the
time
comes
that
you
feel
as
if
you
wanted
to
know
that
you
had
a
friend
think
of
old
ben
an
remember
that
his
heart
beats
just
as
warm
for
you
as
if
he
was
your
father
goodby
my
boy
goodby
an
may
the
good
god
bless
you
goodby
ben
said
toby
and
then
as
the
old
driver
turned
and
walked
away
wiping
something
from
his
eye
with
the
cuff
of
his
sleeve
toby
gave
full
vent
to
his
tears
and
wondered
why
it
was
that
he
was
such
a
miserable
little
wretch
there
was
one
more
goodby
to
be
said
and
that
toby
dreaded
more
than
all
the
others
it
was
to
ella
he
knew
that
she
would
feel
badly
to
have
him
go
because
she
liked
to
ride
the
act
with
him
that
gave
them
such
applause
and
he
felt
certain
that
she
would
urge
him
to
stay
just
then
the
thought
of
another
of
his
friends
one
who
had
not
yet
been
warned
of
what
very
important
matter
was
to
occur
came
to
his
mind
and
he
hastened
toward
the
old
monkey
cage
his
pet
was
busily
engaged
in
playing
with
some
of
the
younger
members
of
his
family
and
for
some
moments
could
not
be
induced
to
come
to
the
bars
of
the
cage
at
last
however
toby
did
succeed
in
coaxing
him
forward
and
then
taking
him
by
the
paw
and
drawing
him
as
near
as
possible
toby
whispered
we
goin
to
run
away
tonight
stubbs
an
i
want
you
to
be
all
ready
to
go
the
minute
i
come
for
the
old
monkey
winked
both
eyes
violently
and
then
showed
his
teeth
to
such
an
extent
that
toby
thought
he
was
laughing
at
the
prospect
and
he
said
a
little
severely
if
you
had
as
many
friends
as
i
have
got
in
the
circus
you
would
laugh
when
you
was
goin
to
leave
them
of
course
i
got
to
go
an
i
want
to
go
but
it
makes
me
feel
bad
to
leave
the
skeleton
an
the
fat
woman
an
old
ben
an
little
ella
but
i
must
stand
here
you
be
ready
when
i
come
for
you
an
by
we
be
so
far
off
that
lord
nor
castle
ca
catch
the
old
monkey
went
toward
his
companions
as
if
he
were
in
high
glee
at
the
trip
before
him
and
toby
went
into
the
dressing
tent
to
prepare
for
the
evening
performance
which
was
about
to
commence
it
appeared
to
the
boy
as
if
everyone
was
unusually
kind
to
him
that
night
and
feeling
sad
at
leaving
those
in
the
circus
who
had
befriended
him
toby
was
unusually
attentive
to
everyone
around
him
he
ran
on
some
trifling
errand
for
one
helped
another
in
his
dressing
and
in
a
dozen
kind
ways
seemed
as
if
trying
to
atone
for
leaving
them
secretly
when
the
time
came
for
him
to
go
into
the
ring
and
he
met
ella
bright
and
happy
at
the
thought
of
riding
with
him
and
repeating
her
triumphs
of
the
afternoon
nothing
save
the
thought
of
how
wicked
he
had
been
to
run
away
from
good
old
uncle
daniel
and
a
desire
to
right
that
wrong
in
some
way
prevented
him
from
giving
up
his
plan
of
going
back
the
little
girl
observed
his
sadness
and
she
whispered
has
anyone
been
whipping
you
toby
toby
shook
his
head
he
had
thought
that
he
would
tell
her
what
he
was
about
to
do
just
before
they
went
into
the
ring
but
her
kind
words
seemed
to
make
that
impossible
and
he
had
said
nothing
when
the
blare
of
the
trumpets
the
noisy
demonstrations
of
the
audience
and
the
announcement
of
the
clown
that
the
wonderful
children
riders
were
now
about
to
appear
ushered
them
into
the
ring
if
toby
had
performed
well
in
the
afternoon
he
accomplished
wonders
on
this
evening
and
they
were
called
back
into
the
ring
not
once
but
twice
and
when
finally
they
were
allowed
to
retire
everyone
behind
the
curtain
overwhelmed
them
with
praise
ella
was
so
profuse
with
her
kind
words
her
admiration
for
what
toby
had
done
and
so
delighted
at
the
idea
that
they
were
to
ride
together
that
even
then
the
boy
could
not
tell
her
what
he
was
going
to
do
but
went
into
his
dressing
room
resolving
that
he
would
tell
her
all
when
they
both
had
finished
dressing
toby
made
as
small
a
parcel
as
possible
of
the
costume
which
and
mrs
treat
had
given
him
for
he
determined
that
he
would
take
it
with
him
and
putting
it
under
his
coat
went
out
to
wait
for
ella
as
she
did
not
come
out
as
soon
as
he
expected
he
asked
someone
to
tell
her
that
he
wanted
to
see
her
and
he
thought
to
himself
that
when
she
did
come
she
would
be
in
a
hurry
and
could
not
stop
long
enough
to
make
any
very
lengthy
objections
to
his
leaving
but
she
did
not
come
at
all
her
mother
sent
out
word
that
toby
could
not
see
her
until
after
the
performance
was
over
owing
to
the
fact
that
it
was
now
nearly
time
for
her
to
go
into
the
ring
and
she
was
not
dressed
yet
toby
was
terribly
disappointed
he
knew
that
it
would
not
be
safe
for
him
to
wait
until
the
close
of
the
performance
if
he
were
intending
to
run
away
that
night
and
he
felt
that
he
could
not
go
until
he
had
said
a
few
last
words
to
her
he
was
in
a
great
perplexity
until
the
thought
came
to
him
that
he
could
write
a
goodby
to
her
and
by
this
means
any
unpleasant
discussion
would
be
avoided
after
some
little
difficulty
he
procured
a
small
piece
of
not
very
clean
paper
and
a
very
short
bit
of
lead
pencil
and
using
the
top
of
one
of
the
wagons
as
he
sat
on
the
seat
for
a
desk
he
indited
the
following
epistle
dear
ella
i
am
goin
to
run
away
two
night
i
want
two
say
good
by
to

me
i
wont
yu
in
haste
toby
tyler
toby
had
no
envelope
in
which
to
seal
this
precious
letter
but
he
felt
that
it
would
not
be
seen
by
prying
eyes
and
would
safely
reach
its
destination
if
he
intrusted
it
to
old
ben
it
did
not
take
him
many
moments
to
find
the
old
driver
and
he
said
as
he
handed
him
the
letter
i
did
see
ella
to
tell
her
i
was
goin
so
i
wrote
this
letter
an
i
want
to
know
if
you
will
give
it
to
her
of
course
i
will
but
see
here
toby
and
ben
caught
him
by
the
sleeve
and
led
him
aside
where
he
would
not
be
overheard
have
you
got
enough
money
to
take
you
home
for
if
you
have
i
can
let
you
have
and
ben
plunged
his
hand
into
his
capacious
pocket
as
if
he
was
about
to
withdraw
from
there
the
entire
united
states
treasury
toby
assured
him
that
he
had
sufficient
for
all
his
wants
but
the
old
man
would
not
be
satisfied
until
he
had
seen
for
himself
and
then
taking
toby
hand
again
he
said
now
my
boy
it
wo
do
for
you
to
stay
around
here
any
longer
buy
something
to
eat
before
you
start
an
go
into
the
woods
for
a
day
or
two
before
you
take
the
train
or
steamboat
you
too
big
a
prize
for
job
or
castle
to
let
you
go
without
a
word
an
they
try
their
level
best
to
find
you
be
careful
now
for
if
they
should
catch
you
goodby
any
more
chances
to
get
away
there
and
here
ben
suddenly
lifted
him
high
from
the
ground
and
kissed
him
now
get
away
as
fast
as
you
toby
pressed
the
old
man
hand
affectionately
and
then
without
trusting
himself
to
speak
walked
swiftly
out
toward
the
entrance
he
resolved
to
take
ben
advice
and
go
into
the
woods
for
a
short
time
and
therefore
he
must
buy
some
provisions
before
he
started
as
he
passed
the
monkeys
cage
he
saw
his
pet
sitting
near
the
bars
and
he
stopped
long
enough
to
whisper
i
be
back
in
ten
minutes
stubbs
an
you
be
all
ready
then
he
went
on
and
just
as
he
got
near
the
entrance
one
of
the
men
told
him
that
mrs
treat
wished
to
see
him
toby
could
hardly
afford
to
spare
the
time
just
then
but
he
would
probably
have
obeyed
the
summons
if
he
had
known
that
by
so
doing
he
would
be
caught
and
he
ran
as
fast
as
his
little
legs
would
carry
him
toward
the
skeleton
tent
the
exhibition
was
open
and
both
the
skeleton
and
his
wife
were
on
the
platform
when
toby
entered
but
he
crept
around
at
the
back
and
up
behind
mrs
treat
chair
telling
her
as
he
did
so
that
he
had
just
received
her
message
and
that
he
must
hurry
right
back
for
every
moment
was
important
then
to
him
i
put
up
a
nice
lunch
for
you
she
said
as
she
kissed
him
and
find
it
on
the
top
of
the
biggest
trunk
now
go
and
if
my
wishes
are
of
any
good
to
you
you
will
get
to
your
uncle
daniel
house
without
any
trouble
goodby
again
little
toby
did
not
dare
to
trust
himself
any
longer
where
everyone
was
so
kind
to
him
he
slipped
down
from
the
platform
as
quickly
as
possible
found
the
bundle
and
a
good
sized
one
it
was
too
without
any
difficulty
and
went
back
to
the
monkeys
cage
as
orders
had
been
given
by
the
proprietor
of
the
circus
that
the
boy
should
do
as
he
had
a
mind
to
with
the
monkey
he
called
stubbs
and
as
he
was
in
the
custom
of
taking
him
with
him
at
night
no
one
thought
that
it
was
anything
strange
that
he
should
take
him
from
the
cage
now
lord
or
castle
might
possibly
have
thought
it
queer
had
either
of
them
seen
the
two
bundles
which
toby
carried
but
fortunately
for
the
boy
scheme
they
both
believed
that
he
was
in
the
dressing
tent
and
consequently
thought
that
he
was
perfectly
safe
toby
hand
shook
so
that
he
could
hardly
undo
the
fastening
of
the
cage
and
when
he
attempted
to
call
the
monkey
to
him
his
voice
sounded
so
strange
and
husky
that
it
startled
him
the
old
monkey
seemed
to
prefer
sleeping
with
toby
rather
than
with
those
of
his
kind
in
the
cage
and
as
the
boy
took
him
with
him
almost
every
night
he
came
on
this
particular
occasion
as
soon
as
toby
called
regardless
of
the
strange
sound
of
his
master
voice
with
his
bundles
under
his
arm
and
the
monkey
on
his
shoulder
with
both
paws
tightly
clasped
around
his
neck
toby
made
his
way
out
of
the
tent
with
beating
heart
and
bated
breath
neither
lord
castle
nor
jacobs
were
in
sight
and
everything
seemed
favorable
for
his
flight
during
the
afternoon
he
had
carefully
noted
the
direction
of
the
woods
and
he
started
swiftly
toward
them
now
stopping
only
long
enough
as
he
was
well
clear
of
the
tents
to
say
in
a
whisper
goodby
mr
treat
an
mrs
treat
an
ella
an
ben
sometime
when
i
a
man
i
come
back
an
bring
you
lots
of
nice
things
an
never
forget
you
never
when
i
have
a
chance
to
be
good
to
some
little
boy
that
felt
as
bad
as
i
did
i
do
it
an
tell
him
that
it
was
you
did
it
then
turning
around
he
ran
toward
the
woods
as
swiftly
as
if
his
escape
had
been
discovered
and
the
entire
company
were
in
pursuit
xviii
a
day
of
freedom
toby
ran
at
the
top
of
his
speed
over
the
rough
road
and
the
monkey
jolted
from
one
side
to
the
other
clutched
his
paws
more
tightly
around
the
boy
neck
looking
around
into
his
face
as
if
to
ask
what
was
the
meaning
of
this
very
singular
proceeding
when
he
was
so
very
nearly
breathless
as
to
be
able
to
run
no
more
but
was
forced
to
walk
toby
looked
behind
him
and
there
he
could
see
the
bright
lights
of
the
circus
and
hear
the
strains
of
the
music
as
he
had
heard
them
on
the
night
when
he
was
getting
ready
to
run
away
from
uncle
daniel
and
those
very
sounds
which
reminded
him
forcibly
of
how
ungrateful
he
had
been
to
the
old
man
who
had
cared
for
him
when
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
world
who
would
do
so
made
it
more
easy
for
him
to
leave
those
behind
who
had
been
so
kind
to
him
when
he
stood
so
much
in
need
of
kindness
we
are
goin
home
stubbs
he
said
exultantly
to
the
monkey
home
to
uncle
an
the
boys
an
wo
you
have
a
good
time
when
we
get
there
you
can
run
all
over
the
barn
an
up
in
the
trees
an
do
just
what
you
want
to
an
there
be
plenty
of
fellows
to
play
with
you
you
do
know
half
how
good
a
place
guilford
is
the
monkey
chattered
away
as
if
he
were
anticipating
lots
of
fun
on
his
arrival
at
toby
home
and
the
boy
chattered
back
his
spirits
rising
at
every
step
which
took
him
farther
away
from
the
collection
of
tents
where
he
had
spent
so
many
wretched
hours
a
brisk
walk
of
half
an
hour
sufficed
to
take
toby
to
the
woods
and
after
some
little
search
he
found
a
thick
clump
of
bushes
in
which
he
concluded
he
could
sleep
without
the
risk
of
being
seen
by
anyone
who
might
pass
that
way
before
he
should
be
awake
in
the
morning
he
had
not
much
choice
in
the
way
of
a
bed
for
it
was
so
dark
in
the
woods
that
it
was
impossible
to
collect
moss
or
leaves
to
make
a
soft
resting
place
and
the
few
leaves
and
pine
boughs
which
he
did
gather
made
his
place
for
sleeping
but
very
little
softer
but
during
the
ten
weeks
that
toby
had
been
with
the
circus
his
bed
had
seldom
been
anything
softer
than
the
seat
of
the
wagon
and
it
troubled
him
very
little
that
he
was
to
sleep
with
nothing
but
a
few
leaves
between
himself
and
the
earth
using
the
bundle
in
which
was
his
riding
costume
for
a
pillow
and
placing
the
lunch
mrs
treat
had
given
him
near
by
where
the
monkey
could
not
get
at
it
conveniently
he
cuddled
stubbs
up
to
his
bosom
and
lay
down
to
sleep
mr
lord
wo
wake
us
up
in
the
mornin
an
swear
at
us
for
not
washin
the
tumblers
said
toby
in
a
tone
of
satisfaction
to
the
monkey
an
we
wo
have
to
go
into
the
tent
tomorrow
an
sell
sick
lemonade
an
poor
peanuts
but
and
here
his
tone
changed
to
one
of
sorrow
there
be
some
there
that
be
sorry
not
to
see
us
in
the
mornin
stubbs
though
they
be
glad
to
know
that
we
got
away
all
right
but
wo
lord
swear
an
wo
castle
crack
his
whip
when
they
come
to
look
round
for
us
in
the
mornin
an
find
that
we
hai
there
the
reply
which
the
monkey
made
to
this
was
to
nestle
his
head
closer
under
toby
coat
and
to
show
in
the
most
decided
manner
that
he
was
ready
to
go
to
sleep
and
toby
was
quite
as
ready
to
go
to
sleep
as
he
was
he
had
worked
hard
that
day
but
the
excitement
of
escaping
had
prevented
him
from
realizing
his
fatigue
until
after
he
had
lain
down
and
almost
before
he
had
got
through
congratulating
himself
upon
the
ease
with
which
he
had
gotten
free
both
he
and
the
monkey
were
as
sound
asleep
as
if
they
had
been
tucked
up
in
the
softest
bed
that
was
ever
made
toby
very
weariness
was
a
friend
to
him
that
night
for
it
prevented
him
from
waking
which
if
he
had
done
so
might
have
been
unpleasant
when
he
fully
realized
that
he
was
all
alone
in
the
forest
and
the
sounds
that
are
always
heard
in
the
woods
might
have
frightened
him
just
the
least
bit
the
sun
was
shining
directly
in
his
face
when
toby
awoke
on
the
following
morning
and
the
old
monkey
was
still
snugly
nestled
under
his
coat
he
sat
up
rather
dazed
at
first
and
then
as
he
fully
realized
that
he
was
actually
free
from
all
that
had
made
his
life
such
a
sad
and
hard
one
for
so
many
weeks
he
shouted
aloud
reveling
in
his
freedom
the
monkey
awakened
by
toby
cries
started
from
his
sleep
in
affright
and
jumped
into
the
nearest
tree
only
to
chatter
jump
and
swing
from
the
boughs
when
he
saw
that
there
was
nothing
very
unusual
going
on
save
that
he
and
toby
were
out
in
the
woods
again
where
they
could
have
no
end
of
a
good
time
and
do
just
as
they
liked
after
a
few
moments
spent
in
a
short
jubilee
at
their
escape
toby
took
the
monkey
on
his
shoulder
and
the
bundles
under
his
arm
again
and
went
cautiously
out
to
the
edge
of
the
thicket
where
he
could
form
some
idea
as
to
whether
or
no
they
were
pursued
he
had
entered
the
woods
at
the
brow
of
a
small
hill
when
he
had
fled
so
hastily
on
the
previous
evening
and
looking
down
he
could
see
the
spot
whereon
the
tents
of
the
circus
had
been
pitched
but
not
a
sign
of
them
was
now
visible
he
could
see
a
number
of
people
walking
around
and
he
fancied
that
they
looked
up
every
now
and
then
to
where
he
stood
concealed
by
the
foliage
this
gave
him
no
little
uneasiness
for
he
feared
that
lord
or
castle
might
be
among
the
number
and
he
believed
that
they
would
begin
a
search
for
him
at
once
and
that
the
spot
where
their
attention
would
first
be
drawn
was
exactly
where
he
was
then
standing
this
wo
do
stubbs
he
said
as
he
pushed
the
monkey
higher
up
on
his
shoulder
and
started
into
the
thickest
part
of
the
woods
we
must
get
out
of
this
place
an
go
farther
down
where
we
can
hide
till
tomorrow
mornin
besides
we
must
find
some
water
where
we
can
wash
our
the
old
monkey
would
hardly
have
been
troubled
if
they
had
not
got
their
faces
washed
for
the
next
month
to
come
but
he
grinned
and
talked
as
toby
trudged
along
attempting
to
catch
hold
of
the
leaves
as
they
were
passed
and
in
various
other
ways
impeding
his
master
progress
until
toby
was
obliged
to
give
him
a
most
severe
scolding
in
order
to
make
him
behave
himself
in
anything
like
a
decent
manner
at
last
after
fully
half
an
hour
rapid
walking
toby
found
just
the
place
he
wanted
in
which
to
pass
the
time
he
concluded
it
would
be
necessary
to
spend
before
he
dare
venture
out
to
start
for
home
it
was
a
little
valley
entirely
filled
by
trees
which
grew
so
thickly
save
in
one
little
spot
as
to
make
it
almost
impossible
to
walk
through
the
one
clear
spot
was
not
more
than
ten
feet
square
but
it
was
just
at
the
edge
of
a
swiftly
running
brook
and
a
more
beautiful
or
convenient
place
for
a
boy
and
a
monkey
to
stop
who
had
no
tent
nor
means
to
build
one
could
not
well
be
imagined
toby
first
act
was
to
wash
his
face
and
he
tried
to
make
the
monkey
do
the
same
but
stubbs
had
no
idea
of
doing
any
such
foolish
thing
he
would
come
down
close
to
the
edge
of
the
water
and
look
in
but
the
moment
that
toby
tried
to
make
him
go
in
he
would
rush
back
among
the
trees
climb
out
on
some
slender
bough
and
then
swing
himself
down
by
the
tail
and
chatter
away
as
if
making
sport
of
his
young
master
for
thinking
that
he
would
be
so
foolish
as
to
soil
his
face
with
water
after
toby
had
made
his
toilet
he
unfastened
the
bundle
which
the
fat
lady
had
given
him
for
the
purpose
of
having
breakfast
as
much
of
an
eater
as
toby
was
he
could
not
but
be
surprised
at
the
quantity
of
food
which
mrs
treat
called
a
lunch
there
were
two
whole
pies
and
half
of
another
as
many
as
two
dozen
doughnuts
several
large
pieces
of
cheese
six
sandwiches
with
a
plentiful
amount
of
meat
half
a
dozen
biscuits
nicely
buttered
and
a
large
piece
of
cake
the
monkey
had
come
down
from
the
tree
as
soon
as
he
saw
toby
untying
the
bundle
and
there
was
quite
as
much
pleasure
depicted
on
his
face
when
he
saw
the
good
things
that
were
spread
out
before
him
as
there
was
on
toby
and
he
showed
his
thankfulness
at
mrs
treat
foresight
by
suddenly
snatching
one
of
the
doughnuts
and
running
with
it
up
the
tree
where
he
knew
toby
could
not
follow
now
look
here
stubbs
said
toby
sternly
you
can
have
all
you
want
to
eat
but
you
must
take
it
in
a
decent
way
an
not
go
to
up
any
such
shines
as
and
after
giving
this
command
which
by
the
way
was
obeyed
just
about
as
well
as
it
was
understood
toby
devoted
his
time
to
his
breakfast
and
he
reduced
the
amount
of
eatables
very
considerably
before
he
had
finished
toby
cleared
off
his
table
by
gathering
the
food
together
and
putting
it
back
into
the
paper
as
well
as
possible
and
then
he
sat
down
to
think
over
the
situation
and
to
decide
what
he
had
better
do
he
felt
rather
nervous
about
venturing
out
when
it
was
possible
for
lord
or
castle
to
get
hold
of
him
again
and
as
the
weather
was
yet
warm
during
the
night
his
camping
place
everything
that
could
be
desired
and
the
stock
of
food
likely
to
hold
out
he
concluded
that
he
had
better
remain
there
for
two
days
at
least
and
then
he
would
be
reasonably
sure
that
if
either
of
the
men
whom
he
so
dreaded
to
see
had
remained
behind
for
the
purpose
of
catching
him
he
would
have
got
tired
out
and
gone
on
this
point
decided
upon
the
next
was
to
try
to
fix
up
something
soft
for
a
bed
he
had
his
pocketknife
with
him
and
in
his
little
valley
were
pine
and
hemlock
trees
in
abundance
from
the
tips
of
their
branches
he
knew
that
he
could
make
a
bed
as
soft
and
fragrant
as
any
that
could
be
thought
of
and
he
set
to
work
at
once
while
stubbs
continued
his
antics
above
his
head
after
about
two
hours
steady
work
he
had
cut
enough
of
the
tender
branches
to
make
himself
a
bed
into
which
he
and
the
monkey
could
burrow
and
sleep
as
comfortably
as
if
they
were
in
the
softest
bed
in
uncle
daniel
house
when
toby
first
began
to
cut
the
boughs
he
had
an
idea
that
he
might
possibly
make
some
sort
of
a
hut
but
the
two
hours
work
had
blistered
his
hands
and
he
was
perfectly
ready
to
sit
down
and
rest
without
the
slightest
desire
for
any
other
kind
of
a
hut
than
that
formed
by
the
trees
themselves
toby
imagined
that
in
that
beautiful
place
he
could
with
the
monkey
stay
contented
for
any
number
of
days
but
after
he
had
rested
a
time
played
with
his
pet
a
little
and
eaten
just
a
trifle
more
of
the
lunch
the
time
passed
so
slowly
that
he
soon
made
up
his
mind
to
run
the
risk
of
meeting
lord
or
castle
again
by
going
out
of
the
woods
the
first
thing
the
next
morning
very
many
times
before
the
sun
set
that
day
was
toby
tempted
to
run
the
risk
that
night
for
the
sake
of
the
change
if
no
more
but
as
he
thought
the
matter
over
he
saw
how
dangerous
such
a
course
would
be
and
he
forced
himself
to
wait
that
night
he
did
not
sleep
as
soundly
as
on
the
previous
one
for
the
very
good
reason
that
he
was
not
as
tired
he
awoke
several
times
and
the
noise
of
the
night
birds
alarmed
him
to
such
an
extent
that
he
was
obliged
to
awaken
the
old
monkey
for
company
but
the
night
passed
despite
his
fears
as
all
nights
will
whether
a
boy
is
out
in
the
woods
alone
or
tucked
up
in
his
own
little
bed
at
home
in
the
morning
toby
made
all
possible
haste
to
get
away
for
each
moment
that
he
stayed
now
made
him
more
impatient
to
be
moving
toward
home
he
washed
himself
as
quickly
as
possible
ate
his
breakfast
with
the
most
unseemly
haste
and
taking
up
his
bundles
and
the
monkey
once
more
started
as
he
supposed
in
the
direction
from
which
he
had
entered
the
woods
toby
walked
briskly
along
in
the
best
possible
spirits
for
his
running
away
was
now
an
accomplished
fact
and
he
was
going
toward
uncle
daniel
and
home
just
as
fast
as
possible
he
sang
old
hundred
through
five
or
six
times
by
way
of
showing
his
happiness
it
is
quite
likely
that
he
would
have
sung
something
a
little
more
lively
had
he
known
anything
else
but
old
hundred
was
the
extent
of
his
musical
education
and
he
kept
repeating
that
which
was
quite
as
satisfactory
as
if
he
had
been
able
to
go
through
with
every
opera
that
was
ever
written
the
monkey
would
jump
from
his
shoulder
into
the
branches
above
run
along
on
the
trees
for
a
short
distance
and
then
wait
until
toby
came
along
when
he
would
drop
down
on
his
shoulder
suddenly
and
in
every
other
way
of
displaying
monkey
delight
he
showed
that
he
was
just
as
happy
as
it
was
possible
toby
trudged
on
in
this
contented
way
for
nearly
an
hour
and
every
moment
expected
to
step
out
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
where
he
could
see
houses
and
men
once
more
but
instead
of
doing
so
the
forest
seemed
to
grow
more
dense
and
nothing
betokened
his
approach
to
the
village
there
was
a
great
fear
came
into
toby
heart
just
then
and
for
a
moment
he
halted
in
helpless
perplexity
his
lips
began
to
quiver
his
face
grew
white
and
his
hand
trembled
so
that
the
old
monkey
took
hold
of
one
of
his
fingers
and
looked
at
it
wonderingly
xix
mr
stubbs
mischief
and
his
sad
fate
toby
had
begun
to
realize
that
he
was
lost
in
the
woods
and
the
thought
was
sufficient
to
cause
alarm
in
the
mind
of
one
much
older
than
the
boy
he
said
to
himself
that
he
would
keep
on
in
the
direction
he
was
then
traveling
for
fifteen
minutes
and
as
he
had
no
means
of
computing
the
time
he
sat
down
on
a
log
took
out
the
bit
of
pencil
with
which
he
had
written
the
letter
to
ella
and
multiplied
sixty
by
fifteen
he
knew
that
there
were
sixty
seconds
to
the
minute
and
that
he
could
ordinarily
count
one
to
each
second
therefore
when
he
learned
that
there
were
nine
hundred
seconds
in
fifteen
minutes
he
resolved
to
walk
as
nearly
straight
ahead
as
possible
until
he
should
have
counted
that
number
he
walked
on
counting
as
regularly
as
he
could
and
thought
to
himself
that
he
never
before
realized
how
long
fifteen
minutes
were
it
really
seemed
to
him
that
an
hour
had
passed
before
he
finished
counting
and
then
when
he
stopped
there
were
no
more
signs
that
he
was
near
a
clearing
than
there
had
been
before
he
started
ah
stubbs
we
lost
we
lost
he
cried
as
he
laid
his
cheek
on
the
monkey
head
and
gave
way
to
the
lonesome
grief
that
came
over
him
what
shall
we
do
perhaps
we
wo
ever
find
our
way
out
but
will
die
here
an
then
uncle
wo
ever
know
how
sorry
i
was
that
i
ran
then
toby
lay
right
down
on
the
ground
and
cried
so
hard
that
the
monkey
acted
as
if
it
were
frightened
and
tried
to
turn
the
boy
face
over
and
finally
leaned
down
and
licked
toby
ear
this
little
act
which
seemed
so
much
like
a
kiss
caused
toby
to
feel
no
small
amount
of
comfort
and
he
sat
up
again
took
the
monkey
in
his
arms
and
began
seriously
to
discuss
some
definite
plan
of
action
it
wo
do
to
keep
on
the
way
we
been
goin
stubbs
said
toby
as
he
looked
full
in
his
pet
face
and
the
old
monkey
sat
as
still
and
looked
as
grave
as
it
was
possible
for
him
to
look
and
sit
for
we
must
be
going
into
the
woods
deeper
let
start
off
this
way
and
toby
pointed
at
right
angles
with
the
course
they
had
been
pursuing
an
keep
right
on
that
way
till
we
come
to
something
or
till
we
drop
right
down
an
it
is
fair
to
presume
that
the
old
monkey
agreed
to
toby
plan
for
although
he
said
nothing
in
favor
of
it
he
certainly
made
no
objections
to
it
which
to
toby
was
the
same
as
if
his
companion
had
assented
to
it
in
the
plainest
english
both
the
bundles
and
the
monkey
were
rather
a
heavy
load
for
a
small
boy
like
toby
to
carry
but
he
clung
manfully
to
them
walked
resolutely
on
without
looking
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
glad
when
the
old
monkey
would
take
a
run
among
the
trees
for
then
he
would
be
relieved
of
his
weight
and
glad
when
he
returned
for
then
he
had
his
company
and
that
repaid
him
for
any
labor
which
he
might
have
to
perform
toby
was
in
a
hard
plight
as
it
was
but
without
the
old
monkey
for
a
companion
he
would
have
thought
his
condition
was
a
hundred
times
worse
and
would
hardly
have
had
the
courage
to
go
on
as
he
was
going
on
and
on
he
walked
until
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
really
go
no
farther
and
yet
he
could
see
no
signs
which
indicated
the
end
of
the
woods
and
at
last
he
sank
upon
the
ground
too
tired
to
walk
another
step
saying
to
the
monkey
who
was
looking
as
if
he
would
like
to
know
the
reason
of
this
pause
it
no
use
stubbs
i
got
to
sit
down
here
an
rest
awhile
anyhow
besides
i
awfully
then
toby
commenced
to
eat
his
dinner
and
to
give
the
monkey
his
until
the
thought
came
to
him
that
he
neither
had
any
water
nor
did
he
know
where
to
find
it
and
then
of
course
he
immediately
became
so
thirsty
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
eat
any
more
we
ca
stand
this
moaned
toby
to
the
monkey
we
got
to
have
something
to
drink
or
else
we
ca
eat
all
these
sweet
things
an
so
tired
that
i
ca
go
any
farther
do
let
eat
dinner
now
but
let
stay
here
an
rest
an
then
we
can
keep
on
an
look
for
toby
resting
spell
was
a
long
one
for
as
soon
as
he
stretched
himself
out
on
the
ground
he
was
asleep
from
actual
exhaustion
and
did
not
awaken
until
the
sun
was
just
setting
and
then
he
saw
that
hard
as
his
troubles
had
been
before
they
were
about
to
become
or
in
fact
had
become
worse
he
had
paid
no
attention
to
his
bundles
when
he
lay
down
and
when
he
awoke
he
was
puzzled
to
make
out
what
it
was
that
was
strewn
around
the
ground
so
thickly
he
had
looked
at
it
but
a
very
short
time
when
he
saw
that
it
was
what
had
been
the
lunch
he
had
carried
so
far
after
having
had
the
sad
experience
of
losing
his
money
he
understood
very
readily
that
the
old
monkey
had
taken
the
lunch
while
he
slept
and
had
amused
himself
by
picking
it
apart
into
the
smallest
particles
possible
and
then
strewn
them
around
on
the
ground
where
he
now
saw
them
toby
looked
at
them
in
almost
speechless
surprise
and
then
he
turned
to
where
the
old
monkey
lay
apparently
asleep
but
as
the
boy
watched
him
intently
he
could
see
that
the
cunning
animal
was
really
watching
him
out
of
one
half
closed
eye
now
you
have
killed
us
stubbs
wailed
toby
we
never
can
find
our
way
out
of
here
an
now
we
hai
got
anything
to
eat
and
by
tomorrow
we
shall
be
starved
to
death
oh
dear
was
you
bad
enough
when
you
threw
all
the
money
away
so
you
had
to
go
an
do
this
just
when
we
was
in
awful
trouble
stubbs
now
looked
up
as
if
he
had
just
been
awakened
by
grief
looked
around
him
leisurely
as
if
to
see
what
could
be
the
matter
and
then
apparently
seeing
for
the
first
time
the
crumbs
that
were
lying
around
on
the
ground
took
up
some
and
examined
them
intently
now
do
go
to
makin
believe
that
you
do
know
how
they
come
there
said
toby
showing
anger
toward
his
pet
for
the
first
time
you
know
it
was
you
who
did
it
for
there
was
anyone
else
here
an
you
ca
fool
me
by
lookin
so
it
seemed
as
if
the
monkey
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
his
little
plan
of
ignorance
was
the
most
perfect
success
for
he
walked
meekly
toward
his
young
master
climbed
up
on
his
shoulder
and
sat
there
kissing
his
ear
or
looking
down
into
his
eyes
until
the
boy
could
resist
the
mute
appeal
no
longer
and
took
him
into
his
arms
and
hugged
him
closely
as
he
said
it
ca
be
helped
now
i
an
we
shall
have
to
get
along
the
best
way
we
can
but
it
was
awful
wicked
of
you
stubbs
an
i
know
what
we
goin
to
do
for
something
to
while
the
destructive
fit
was
on
him
the
old
monkey
had
not
spared
the
smallest
bit
of
food
but
had
picked
everything
into
such
minute
shreds
that
none
of
it
could
be
gathered
up
and
everything
was
surely
wasted
while
toby
sat
bemoaning
his
fate
and
trying
to
make
out
what
was
to
be
done
for
food
the
darkness
which
had
just
begun
to
gather
when
he
first
awoke
now
commenced
to
settle
around
and
he
was
obliged
to
seek
for
some
convenient
place
in
which
to
spend
the
night
before
it
became
so
dark
as
to
make
the
search
impossible
owing
to
the
fact
that
he
had
slept
nearly
the
entire
afternoon
and
also
rendered
wakeful
by
the
loss
he
had
just
sustained
toby
lay
awake
on
the
hard
ground
with
the
monkey
on
his
arm
hour
after
hour
until
all
kinds
of
fancies
came
to
him
and
in
every
sound
feared
he
heard
someone
from
the
circus
coming
to
capture
him
or
some
wild
beast
intent
on
picking
his
bones
the
cold
sweat
of
fear
stood
out
on
his
brow
and
he
hardly
dared
to
breathe
much
more
to
speak
lest
the
sound
of
his
voice
should
betray
his
whereabouts
and
thus
bring
his
enemies
down
upon
him
the
minutes
seemed
like
hours
and
the
hours
like
days
as
he
lay
there
listening
fearfully
to
every
one
of
the
night
sounds
of
the
forest
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
been
there
very
many
hours
when
at
last
he
fell
asleep
and
was
thus
freed
from
his
fears
bright
and
early
on
the
following
morning
toby
was
awake
and
as
he
came
to
a
realizing
sense
of
all
the
dangers
and
trouble
that
surrounded
him
he
was
disposed
to
give
way
again
to
his
sorrow
but
he
said
resolutely
to
himself
it
might
be
a
good
deal
worse
than
it
is
an
stubbs
an
i
can
get
along
one
day
without
anything
to
eat
an
perhaps
by
night
we
shall
be
out
of
the
woods
an
then
what
we
get
will
taste
good
to
he
began
his
walk
which
possibly
might
not
end
that
day
manfully
and
his
courage
was
rewarded
by
soon
reaching
a
number
of
bushes
that
were
literally
loaded
down
with
blackberries
from
these
he
made
a
hearty
meal
and
the
old
monkey
fairly
reveled
in
them
for
he
ate
all
he
possibly
could
and
then
stowed
enough
in
his
cheeks
to
make
a
good
sized
luncheon
when
he
should
be
hungry
again
refreshed
very
much
by
his
breakfast
of
fruit
toby
again
started
on
his
journey
with
renewed
vigor
and
the
world
began
to
look
very
bright
to
him
he
had
not
thought
that
he
might
find
berries
when
the
thoughts
of
starvation
came
into
his
mind
and
now
that
his
hunger
was
satisfied
he
began
to
believe
that
he
might
possibly
be
able
to
live
perhaps
for
weeks
in
the
woods
solely
upon
what
he
might
find
growing
there
shortly
after
he
had
breakfast
he
came
upon
a
brook
which
he
thought
was
the
same
upon
whose
banks
he
had
encamped
the
first
night
he
spent
in
the
woods
and
pulling
off
his
clothes
he
waded
into
the
deepest
part
and
had
a
most
refreshing
bath
although
the
water
was
rather
cold
not
having
any
towels
with
which
to
dry
himself
he
was
obliged
to
sit
in
the
sun
until
the
moisture
had
been
dried
from
his
skin
and
he
could
put
his
clothes
on
once
more
then
he
started
out
on
his
walk
again
feeling
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
come
out
all
right
all
this
time
he
had
been
traveling
without
any
guide
to
tell
him
whether
he
was
going
straight
ahead
or
around
in
a
circle
and
he
now
concluded
to
follow
the
course
of
the
brook
believing
that
that
would
lead
him
out
of
the
forest
some
time
during
the
afternoon
he
walked
steadily
but
not
so
fast
that
he
would
get
exhausted
quickly
and
when
by
the
position
of
the
sun
he
judged
that
it
was
noon
he
lay
down
on
a
mossy
bank
to
rest
he
was
beginning
to
feel
sad
again
he
had
found
no
more
berries
and
the
elation
which
had
been
caused
by
his
breakfast
and
his
bath
was
quickly
passing
away
the
old
monkey
was
in
a
tree
almost
directly
above
his
head
stretched
out
on
one
of
the
limbs
in
the
most
contented
manner
possible
and
as
toby
watched
him
and
thought
of
all
the
trouble
he
had
caused
by
wasting
the
food
thoughts
of
starvation
again
came
into
his
mind
and
he
believed
that
he
should
not
live
to
see
uncle
daniel
again
just
as
he
was
feeling
the
most
sad
and
lonely
and
where
thoughts
of
death
from
starvation
were
most
vivid
in
his
mind
he
heard
the
barking
of
a
dog
which
sounded
close
at
hand
his
first
thought
was
that
at
last
he
was
saved
and
he
was
just
starting
to
his
feet
to
shout
for
help
when
he
heard
the
sharp
report
of
a
gun
and
an
agonizing
cry
from
the
branches
above
and
the
old
monkey
fell
to
the
ground
with
a
thud
that
told
he
had
received
his
death
wound
all
this
had
taken
place
so
quickly
that
toby
did
not
at
first
comprehend
the
extent
of
the
misfortune
which
had
overtaken
him
but
a
groan
from
the
poor
monkey
as
he
placed
one
little
brown
paw
to
his
breast
from
which
the
blood
was
flowing
freely
and
looked
up
into
his
master
face
with
a
most
piteous
expression
showed
the
poor
little
boy
what
a
great
trouble
it
was
which
had
now
come
poor
toby
uttered
a
loud
cry
of
agony
which
could
not
have
been
more
full
of
anguish
had
he
received
the
ball
in
his
own
breast
and
flinging
himself
by
the
side
of
the
dying
monkey
he
gathered
him
close
to
his
breast
regardless
of
the
blood
that
poured
over
him
and
stroking
tenderly
the
little
head
that
had
nestled
so
often
in
his
bosom
said
over
and
over
again
as
the
monkey
uttered
short
moans
of
agony
who
could
have
been
so
cruel
who
could
have
been
so
cruel
toby
tears
ran
like
rain
down
his
face
and
he
kissed
his
dying
pet
again
and
again
as
if
he
would
take
all
the
pain
to
himself
oh
if
you
could
only
speak
to
me
he
cried
as
he
took
one
of
the
poor
monkey
paws
in
his
hand
and
finding
that
it
was
growing
cold
with
the
chill
of
death
put
it
on
his
neck
to
warm
it
how
i
love
you
stubbs
an
now
you
goin
to
die
an
leave
me
oh
if
i
spoken
cross
to
you
yesterday
an
if
i
had
choked
you
the
day
that
we
went
to
the
skeleton
to
dinner
forgive
me
for
ever
bein
bad
to
you
wo
you
stubbs
as
the
monkey
groans
increased
in
number
but
diminished
in
force
toby
ran
to
the
brook
filled
his
hands
with
water
and
held
it
to
the
poor
animal
mouth
he
lapped
the
water
quickly
and
looked
up
with
a
human
look
of
gratitude
in
his
eyes
as
if
thanking
his
master
for
that
much
relief
then
toby
tried
to
wash
the
blood
from
his
breast
but
it
flowed
quite
as
fast
as
he
could
wash
it
away
and
he
ceased
his
efforts
in
that
direction
and
paid
every
attention
to
making
his
friend
and
pet
more
comfortable
he
took
off
his
jacket
and
laid
it
on
the
ground
for
the
monkey
to
lie
upon
picked
a
quantity
of
large
green
leaves
as
a
cooling
rest
for
his
head
and
then
sat
by
his
side
holding
his
paws
and
talking
to
him
with
the
most
tender
words
his
lips
quivering
with
sorrow
as
they
were
could
fashion
xx
home
and
uncle
daniel
meanwhile
the
author
of
all
this
misery
had
come
upon
the
scene
he
was
a
young
man
whose
rifle
and
well
filled
game
bag
showed
that
he
had
been
hunting
and
his
face
expressed
the
liveliest
sorrow
for
what
he
had
so
unwittingly
done
i
did
know
i
was
firing
at
your
pet
he
said
to
toby
as
he
laid
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
endeavored
to
make
him
look
up
i
only
saw
a
little
patch
of
fur
through
the
trees
and
thinking
it
was
some
wild
animal
i
fired
forgive
me
wo
you
and
let
me
put
the
poor
brute
out
of
his
misery
toby
looked
up
fiercely
at
the
murderer
of
his
pet
and
asked
savagely
why
do
you
go
away
do
you
see
that
you
have
killed
stubbs
an
you
be
hung
for
murder
i
would
have
done
it
under
any
circumstances
said
the
young
man
pitying
toby
grief
most
sincerely
come
away
and
let
me
put
the
poor
thing
out
of
its
how
can
you
do
it
asked
toby
bitterly
he
dying
i
know
it
and
it
will
be
a
kindness
to
put
a
bullet
through
his
if
toby
had
been
big
enough
perhaps
there
might
really
have
been
a
murder
committed
for
he
looked
up
at
the
man
who
so
coolly
proposed
to
kill
the
poor
monkey
after
he
had
already
received
his
death
wound
that
the
young
man
stepped
back
quickly
as
if
really
afraid
that
in
his
desperation
the
boy
might
do
him
some
injury
go
off
said
toby
passionately
an
do
ever
come
here
again
you
killed
all
i
ever
had
in
this
world
of
my
own
to
love
me
an
i
hate
you
i
hate
you
then
turning
again
to
the
monkey
he
put
his
hands
on
each
side
of
his
head
and
leaning
down
kissed
the
little
brown
lips
as
tenderly
as
a
mother
would
kiss
her
child
the
monkey
was
growing
more
and
more
feeble
and
when
toby
had
shown
this
act
of
affection
he
reached
up
his
tiny
paws
grasped
finger
half
raised
himself
from
the
ground
and
then
with
a
convulsive
struggle
fell
back
dead
while
the
tiny
fingers
slowly
relaxed
their
hold
of
the
boy
hand
toby
feared
that
it
was
death
and
yet
hoped
that
he
was
mistaken
he
looked
into
the
half
open
fast
glazing
eyes
put
his
hand
over
his
heart
to
learn
if
it
were
still
beating
and
getting
no
responsive
look
from
the
dead
eyes
feeling
no
heart
throbs
from
under
that
gory
breast
he
knew
that
his
pet
was
really
dead
and
flung
himself
by
his
side
in
all
the
childish
abandonment
of
grief
he
called
the
monkey
by
name
implored
him
to
look
at
him
and
finally
bewailed
that
he
had
ever
left
the
circus
where
at
least
his
pet
life
was
safe
even
if
his
own
back
received
its
daily
flogging
the
young
man
who
stood
a
silent
spectator
of
this
painful
scene
understood
everything
from
toby
mourning
he
knew
that
a
boy
had
run
away
from
the
circus
for
lord
and
castle
had
stayed
behind
one
day
in
the
hope
of
capturing
the
fugitive
and
they
had
told
their
own
version
of
toby
flight
for
nearly
an
hour
toby
lay
by
the
dead
monkey
side
crying
as
if
his
heart
would
break
and
the
young
man
waited
until
his
grief
should
have
somewhat
exhausted
itself
and
then
approached
the
boy
again
wo
you
believe
that
i
did
mean
to
do
this
cruel
thing
he
asked
in
a
kindly
voice
and
wo
you
believe
that
i
would
do
anything
in
my
power
to
bring
your
pet
back
to
life
toby
looked
at
him
a
moment
earnestly
and
then
said
slowly
yes
try
now
will
you
come
with
me
and
let
me
talk
to
you
for
i
know
who
you
are
and
why
you
are
how
do
you
know
that
two
men
stayed
behind
after
the
circus
had
left
and
they
hunted
everywhere
for
i
wish
they
had
caught
me
moaned
toby
i
wish
they
had
caught
me
for
then
stubbs
would
be
here
and
toby
grief
broke
out
afresh
as
he
again
looked
at
the
poor
little
stiff
form
that
had
been
a
source
of
so
much
comfort
and
joy
to
him
try
not
to
think
of
that
now
but
think
of
yourself
and
of
what
you
will
do
said
the
man
soothingly
anxious
to
divert
toby
mind
from
the
monkey
death
as
much
as
possible
i
do
want
to
think
of
myself
and
i
do
care
what
i
do
sobbed
the
boy
passionately
but
you
must
you
ca
stay
here
always
and
i
will
try
to
help
you
to
get
home
or
wherever
it
is
you
want
to
go
if
you
will
tell
me
all
about
it
was
some
time
before
toby
could
be
persuaded
to
speak
or
think
of
anything
but
the
death
of
his
pet
but
the
young
man
finally
succeeded
in
drawing
his
story
from
him
and
then
tried
to
induce
him
to
leave
that
place
and
accompany
him
to
town
i
ca
leave
stubbs
said
the
boy
firmly
he
never
left
me
the
night
i
got
thrown
out
of
the
wagon
an
he
thought
i
was
then
came
another
struggle
to
induce
him
to
bury
his
pet
and
finally
toby
after
realizing
the
fact
that
he
could
not
carry
a
dead
monkey
with
him
agreed
to
it
but
he
would
not
allow
the
young
man
to
help
him
in
any
way
or
even
to
touch
the
monkey
body
he
dug
a
grave
under
a
little
fir
tree
near
by
and
lined
it
with
wild
flowers
and
leaves
and
even
then
hesitated
to
cover
the
body
with
the
earth
at
last
he
bethought
himself
of
the
fanciful
costume
which
the
skeleton
and
his
wife
had
given
him
and
in
this
he
carefully
wrapped
his
dead
pet
he
had
not
one
regret
at
leaving
the
bespangled
suit
for
it
was
the
best
he
could
command
and
surely
nothing
could
be
too
good
for
stubbs
tenderly
he
laid
him
in
the
little
grave
and
covering
the
body
with
flowers
said
pausing
a
moment
before
he
covered
it
over
with
earth
and
while
his
voice
was
choked
with
emotion
goodby
stubbs
goodby
i
wish
it
had
been
me
instead
of
you
that
died
for
i
an
awful
sorry
little
boy
now
that
you
dead
even
after
the
grave
had
been
filled
and
a
little
mound
made
over
it
the
young
man
had
the
greatest
difficulty
to
persuade
toby
to
go
with
him
and
when
the
boy
did
consent
to
go
at
last
he
walked
very
slowly
away
and
kept
turning
his
head
to
look
back
just
so
long
as
the
little
grave
could
be
seen
then
when
the
trees
shut
it
completely
out
from
sight
the
tears
commenced
again
to
roll
down
toby
cheeks
and
he
sobbed
out
i
wish
i
had
left
him
oh
why
did
i
make
him
lie
down
by
me
an
then
be
alive
now
an
how
glad
he
be
to
know
that
we
was
getting
out
of
the
woods
at
last
but
the
man
who
had
caused
toby
this
sorrow
talked
to
him
about
other
matters
thus
taking
his
mind
from
the
monkey
death
as
much
as
possible
and
by
the
time
the
boy
reached
the
village
he
had
told
his
story
exactly
as
it
was
without
casting
any
reproaches
on
lord
and
giving
himself
the
full
share
of
censure
for
leaving
his
home
as
he
did
lord
and
castle
had
remained
in
the
town
but
one
day
for
they
were
told
that
a
boy
had
taken
the
night
train
that
passed
through
the
town
about
two
hours
after
toby
had
escaped
and
they
had
set
off
at
once
to
act
on
that
information
therefore
toby
need
have
no
fears
of
meeting
either
of
them
just
then
and
he
could
start
on
his
homeward
journey
in
peace
the
young
man
who
had
caused
the
monkey
death
tried
first
to
persuade
toby
to
remain
a
day
or
two
with
him
and
failing
in
that
he
did
all
he
could
toward
getting
the
boy
home
as
quickly
and
safely
as
possible
he
insisted
on
paying
for
his
ticket
on
the
steamboat
although
toby
did
all
he
could
to
prevent
him
and
he
even
accompanied
toby
to
the
next
town
where
he
was
to
take
the
steamer
he
had
not
only
paid
for
toby
ticket
but
he
had
paid
for
a
stateroom
for
him
and
when
the
boy
said
that
he
could
sleep
anywhere
and
that
there
was
no
need
of
such
expense
the
man
replied
those
men
who
were
hunting
for
you
have
gone
down
the
river
and
will
be
very
likely
to
search
the
boat
when
they
discover
that
they
started
on
the
wrong
scent
they
will
never
suspect
that
you
have
got
a
stateroom
and
if
you
are
careful
to
remain
in
it
during
the
trip
you
will
get
through
then
when
the
time
came
for
the
steamer
to
start
the
young
man
said
to
toby
now
my
boy
you
wo
feel
hard
at
me
for
shooting
the
monkey
will
you
i
would
have
done
anything
to
bring
him
back
to
life
but
as
i
could
not
do
that
helping
you
to
get
home
was
the
next
best
thing
i
could
i
know
you
did
mean
to
shoot
stubbs
said
toby
with
moistening
eyes
as
he
spoke
of
his
pet
an
i
sorry
i
said
what
i
did
to
you
in
the
before
there
was
time
to
say
any
more
the
warning
whistle
was
sounded
the
plank
pulled
in
the
great
wheels
commenced
to
revolve
and
toby
was
really
on
his
way
to
uncle
daniel
and
guilford
it
was
then
but
five
in
the
afternoon
and
he
could
not
expect
to
reach
home
until
two
or
three
in
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
but
he
was
in
a
tremor
of
excitement
as
he
thought
that
he
should
walk
through
the
streets
of
guilford
once
more
see
all
the
boys
and
go
home
to
uncle
daniel
and
yet
whenever
he
thought
of
that
home
of
meeting
those
boys
of
going
once
more
to
all
those
old
familiar
places
the
memory
of
all
that
he
had
planned
when
he
should
take
the
monkey
with
him
would
come
into
his
mind
and
damp
even
his
joy
great
as
it
was
that
night
he
had
considerable
difficulty
in
falling
asleep
but
did
finally
succeed
in
doing
so
and
when
he
awoke
the
steamer
was
going
up
the
river
whose
waters
seemed
like
an
old
friend
because
they
had
flowed
right
down
past
guilford
on
their
way
to
the
sea
at
each
town
where
a
landing
was
made
toby
looked
eagerly
out
on
the
pier
thinking
that
by
chance
someone
from
his
home
might
be
there
and
he
would
see
a
familiar
face
again
but
all
this
time
he
heeded
the
advice
given
him
and
remained
in
his
room
where
he
could
see
and
not
be
seen
and
it
was
well
for
him
that
he
did
so
for
at
one
of
the
landings
he
saw
both
lord
and
castle
come
on
board
the
boat
toby
heart
beat
fast
and
furious
and
he
expected
every
moment
to
hear
them
at
the
door
demanding
admittance
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
must
know
exactly
where
he
was
secreted
but
no
such
misfortune
occurred
the
men
had
evidently
only
boarded
the
boat
to
search
for
the
boy
for
they
landed
again
before
the
steamer
started
and
toby
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
their
backs
as
they
walked
away
from
the
pier
it
was
some
time
before
he
recovered
from
the
fright
which
the
sight
of
them
gave
him
but
when
he
did
his
thoughts
and
hopes
far
outstripped
the
steamer
which
it
seemed
was
going
so
slowly
and
he
longed
to
see
guilford
with
an
impatience
that
could
hardly
be
restrained
at
last
he
could
see
the
spire
of
the
little
church
on
the
hill
and
when
the
steamer
rounded
the
point
affording
a
full
view
of
the
town
and
sounded
her
whistle
as
a
signal
for
those
on
the
shore
to
come
to
the
pier
toby
could
hardly
restrain
himself
from
jumping
up
and
down
and
shouting
in
his
delight
he
was
at
the
gangplank
ready
to
land
fully
five
minutes
before
the
steamer
was
anywhere
near
the
wharf
and
when
he
recognized
the
first
face
on
the
pier
what
a
happy
boy
he
was
he
was
at
home
the
dream
of
the
past
ten
weeks
was
at
length
realized
and
neither
lord
nor
castle
had
any
terrors
for
him
now
he
ran
down
the
gangplank
before
it
was
ready
and
clasped
every
boy
he
saw
there
round
the
neck
and
would
have
kissed
them
if
they
had
shown
an
inclination
to
let
him
do
so
of
course
he
was
overwhelmed
with
questions
but
before
he
would
answer
any
he
asked
for
uncle
daniel
and
the
others
at
home
some
of
the
boys
ventured
to
predict
that
toby
would
get
a
jolly
good
whipping
for
running
away
and
the
only
reply
which
the
happy
toby
made
to
that
was
i
hope
i
will
an
then
i
feel
as
if
i
had
kinder
paid
for
away
if
uncle
will
only
let
me
stay
with
him
again
he
may
whip
me
every
mornin
an
i
wo
open
my
mouth
to
the
boys
were
impatient
to
hear
the
story
of
toby
travels
but
he
refused
to
tell
it
them
saying
i
go
home
an
if
uncle
forgives
me
for
bein
so
wicked
sit
down
this
afternoon
an
tell
you
all
you
want
to
know
about
the
then
far
more
rapidly
than
he
had
run
away
from
it
toby
ran
toward
the
home
which
he
had
called
his
ever
since
he
could
remember
and
his
heart
was
full
almost
to
bursting
as
he
thought
that
perhaps
he
would
be
told
that
he
had
forfeited
all
claim
to
it
and
that
he
could
never
more
call
it
home
again
when
he
entered
the
old
familiar
sitting
room
uncle
daniel
was
seated
near
the
window
alone
looking
out
wistfully
as
toby
thought
across
the
fields
of
yellow
waving
grain
toby
crept
softly
in
and
going
up
to
the
old
man
knelt
down
and
said
very
humbly
and
with
his
whole
soul
in
the
words
oh
uncle
if
you
only
forgive
me
for
bein
wicked
an
runnin
away
an
let
me
stay
here
again
for
it
all
the
home
i
ever
had
i
do
everything
you
tell
me
to
an
never
whisper
in
meetin
or
do
anything
and
then
he
waited
for
the
words
which
would
seal
his
fate
they
were
not
long
in
coming
my
poor
boy
said
uncle
daniel
softly
as
he
stroked
refractory
red
hair
my
love
for
you
was
greater
than
i
knew
and
when
you
left
me
i
cried
aloud
to
the
lord
as
if
it
had
been
my
own
flesh
and
blood
that
had
gone
afar
from
me
stay
here
toby
my
son
and
help
to
support
this
poor
old
body
as
it
goes
down
into
the
dark
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
and
then
in
the
bright
light
of
that
glorious
future
uncle
daniel
will
wait
to
go
with
you
into
the
presence
of
him
who
is
ever
a
father
to
the
and
in
uncle
daniel
kindly
care
we
may
safely
leave
toby
tyler
the
end
