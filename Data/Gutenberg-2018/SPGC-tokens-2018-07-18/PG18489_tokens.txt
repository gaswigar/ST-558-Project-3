nothing
impaired
but
all
disordered
night
there
are
four
in
my
house
it
is
not
a
large
house
and
how
there
came
to
be
so
many
rooms
to
spare
for
the
entertaining
of
friends
is
not
a
story
to
be
told
here
it
is
only
a
few
years
since
they
were
all
full
and
not
with
guests
but
they
are
nearly
always
full
now
and
when
i
assign
each
room
it
is
after
taking
thought
there
are
two
men
rooms
and
two
for
women
the
men
rooms
have
belonged
to
men
and
therefore
they
suit
other
men
who
drop
into
them
and
use
their
belongings
and
tell
me
they
were
never
more
comfortable
the
third
room
is
for
one
after
another
of
the
girls
and
women
who
visit
me
the
fourth
room
is
anybody
really
good
enough
to
sleep
in
this
place
it
was
the
skeptic
looking
over
my
shoulder
he
had
chanced
to
be
passing
saw
me
standing
in
the
doorway
in
an
attitude
of
adoration
and
glanced
in
over
my
head
he
had
continued
to
look
from
sheer
astonishment
i
should
expect
to
have
to
take
off
my
shoes
and
put
on
a
white
cassock
over
my
tennis
flannels
before
i
could
enter
here
he
observed
you
would
not
be
allowed
to
enter
even
in
that
inappropriate
costume
i
replied
i
keep
this
room
only
for
the
very
nicest
of
my
girl
friends
the
trouble
is
the
trouble
is
you
full
up
with
our
bunch
and
have
got
to
put
miss
althea
here
whether
she
turns
out
to
be
the
sort
or
not
i
had
not
expected
the
skeptic
to
be
so
shrewd
shrewd
though
he
often
is
being
also
skeptical
his
skepticism
sometimes
overcolours
his
imagination
suppose
she
should
leave
her
slippers
kicking
around
over
those
white
rugs
drop
her
kimono
in
the
middle
of
that
bed
and
er
attach
a
mound
of
to
the
corner
of
the
mirror
he
propounded
i
should
send
her
home
no
you
could
do
better
than
that
make
her
change
rooms
with
the
philosopher
he
would
leave
a
speck
the
size
of
a
molecule
on
all
that
whiteness
i
do
believe
he
would
i
agreed
as
the
skeptic
went
laughing
away
downstairs
i
turned
again
into
the
room
in
order
that
i
might
tie
back
the
little
inner
muslin
curtains
to
let
the
green
branches
outside
show
between
althea
arrived
at
five
the
skeptic
in
tennis
flannels
was
lounging
on
the
porch
as
she
came
up
the
steps
and
scanned
her
critically
over
the
racquet
he
still
held
after
a
brisk
with
the
gay
lady
who
is
one
of
my
other
guests
we
call
her
the
gay
lady
because
of
her
face
her
trick
of
smiling
when
other
people
frown
and
because
of
a
certain
soft
sparkle
and
glow
about
her
whole
personality
as
indescribable
as
it
is
captivating
the
gay
lady
had
gone
indoors
to
dress
for
the
evening
and
the
philosopher
had
not
returned
from
the
long
daily
tramp
by
which
he
keeps
himself
in
trim
the
lad
was
on
the
porch
mending
some
my
lad
with
the
clear
young
eyes
which
see
things
althea
gave
the
skeptic
a
glance
the
lad
a
smile
and
me
a
hearty
embrace
i
had
never
seen
her
before
and
her
visit
had
been
brought
about
by
a
request
from
her
mother
an
old
friend
who
was
anxious
to
have
her
daughter
spend
a
pleasant
vacation
in
the
absence
of
most
of
the
girl
family
it
was
impossible
not
to
like
my
new
guest
at
once
she
was
a
healthy
hearty
blooming
sort
of
girl
good
to
look
at
pleasant
company
to
have
about
and
as
i
soon
learned
to
a
degree
which
it
seemed
nothing
could
upset
she
followed
me
upstairs
talking
brightly
all
the
way
and
made
her
entrance
into
the
white
room
as
a
pink
hollyhock
might
drop
unconcernedly
into
a
pan
of
milk
what
a
lovely
room
she
cried
and
dropped
her
coat
and
umbrella
upon
the
bed
the
lad
following
with
her
handbag
stopped
to
look
at
his
tennis
shoes
before
he
set
foot
upon
the
white
rug
and
dusted
off
the
bag
with
a
somewhat
grimy
handkerchief
before
he
stood
it
on
the
hearth
the
lad
knows
how
i
feel
about
the
room
and
though
he
races
into
his
own
with
muddy
feet
stands
in
awe
of
the
place
where
only
girls
are
made
at
home
i
have
but
two
both
of
whom
must
be
busy
in
kitchen
and
when
the
house
is
full
of
guests
so
i
always
make
the
rounds
of
the
bedrooms
in
the
evening
to
see
to
lights
and
water
and
to
turn
down
the
coverings
on
the
beds
the
skeptic
room
needed
only
a
touch
here
and
there
to
put
it
in
order
for
the
night
the
needed
none
the
gay
lady
had
left
her
pretty
quarters
looking
as
if
a
lady
lived
in
them
and
had
but
dropped
a
dainty
reminder
of
herself
here
and
there
to
give
them
character
an
embroidered
on
the
bureau
an
attractive
travelling
on
the
table
by
her
bed
a
photograph
a
handkerchief
a
gossamer
scarf
on
a
ready
for
use
if
she
should
need
it
for
a
stroll
in
the
moonlight
with
the
skeptic
the
closet
door
ajar
gave
a
glimpse
of
summer
frocks
hanging
in
order
on
padded
hangers
brought
in
a
trunk
beneath
a
row
of
incredibly
small
smart
shoes
stood
awaiting
their
turn
even
the
gay
lady
trunk
was
clad
in
a
trim
beflowered
cover
of
linen
and
looked
a
part
of
the
place
i
smiled
to
myself
as
i
turned
down
the
white
sheets
over
my
best
quilt
of
pale
pink
and
thought
of
the
gay
lady
delightful
custom
of
keeping
her
room
swept
and
dusted
without
letting
anybody
know
when
she
did
it
i
felt
my
way
across
althea
room
to
light
the
lamp
there
are
no
electrics
in
my
old
country
home
as
i
went
in
i
stumbled
over
a
rug
whose
corner
had
been
drawn
into
a
bunch
by
the
edge
of
a
trunk
which
had
been
pulled
too
far
toward
the
middle
of
the
room
i
encountered
a
chair
hung
full
with
clothing
i
pushed
what
felt
like
a
shoe
out
of
my
path
it
took
some
time
for
me
to
find
the
which
ordinarily
stands
on
a
corner
of
the
my
groping
hand
encountered
all
sorts
of
unfamiliar
objects
in
its
quest
and
it
was
not
without
a
premonition
of
what
i
was
about
to
see
that
i
finally
lit
the
lamp
and
looked
around
me
well
of
course
she
had
unpacked
hurriedly
as
hurriedly
dressed
for
dinner
and
she
had
been
detained
downstairs
ever
since
i
should
not
judge
in
haste
doubtless
in
the
morning
she
would
put
things
to
rights
i
removed
a
from
the
bed
hung
up
several
frocks
in
the
closet
cleared
away
the
rest
of
the
belongings
from
the
counterpane
and
arranged
althea
bed
for
the
night
i
did
the
rest
of
my
work
quickly
and
returned
to
lower
the
light
it
could
be
really
no
it
could
be
there
must
be
some
other
way
of
accounting
for
those
scratches
on
the
hitherto
spotless
white
wall
now
marred
by
five
long
brown
marks
where
a
match
had
been
drawn
again
and
again
before
it
struck
into
light
it
have
been
althea
yet
those
marks
were
never
there
before
it
was
full
daylight
when
my
guest
had
arrived
she
could
have
had
no
need
for
artificial
light
wait
there
lay
a
long
black
object
on
the
white
cover
of
the
a
curling
iron
in
the
hall
i
ran
into
the
skeptic
i
beg
your
pardon
he
cried
under
his
breath
i
came
up
for
her
scarf
she
said
it
was
just
inside
her
door
on
her
trunk
may
i
go
in
i
get
it
for
you
said
i
and
turned
inside
the
skeptic
stood
outside
the
door
looking
into
the
dimness
i
could
not
find
the
scarf
i
would
not
turn
up
the
light
i
searched
and
searched
vainly
let
me
give
you
something
to
see
by
said
the
skeptic
and
before
i
could
prevent
him
he
had
bolted
into
the
room
and
turned
up
the
lamp
here
it
is
said
he
and
caught
up
some
article
of
apparel
from
the
oh
no
this
must
be
a
sash
said
he
and
dropped
it
he
stood
looking
about
him
go
away
said
i
sternly
i
find
it
i
do
think
you
will
said
he
in
this
er
this
pandemonium
i
walked
over
to
the
and
put
out
the
lamp
now
will
you
go
away
said
i
you
were
expeditious
said
he
making
for
the
hall
and
stumbling
over
something
as
he
went
but
not
quite
expeditious
enough
never
mind
about
the
scarf
i
think
i
let
the
philosopher
take
the
girl
guest
to
walk
the
gay
lady
good
enough
for
me
i
say
as
he
moved
toward
the
staircase
and
i
followed
do
you
think
we
better
move
the
philosopher
in
said
i
with
assumed
conviction
it
will
be
different
please
reserve
your
judgment
i
tried
to
reserve
my
own
i
did
not
go
into
althea
room
again
until
the
next
evening
at
the
same
hour
i
found
ten
articles
strewn
where
five
had
lain
before
a
bottle
of
something
green
had
been
tipped
over
upon
the
white
embroidered
cover
of
my
a
spot
of
ink
adorned
the
edge
of
the
sheet
and
the
condition
of
the
bed
showed
plainly
that
an
afternoon
nap
upon
it
had
ended
with
some
letter
writing
i
think
althea
shoes
had
been
dusted
with
one
of
my
best
towels
i
did
not
stay
to
see
what
else
had
been
done
but
i
could
not
help
noting
three
more
brown
scratches
on
my
white
wall
at
the
end
of
the
week
althea
went
away
when
she
had
gone
i
went
up
to
her
room
i
had
been
at
work
there
for
some
time
when
a
tap
at
the
door
interrupted
me
the
skeptic
stood
outside
with
a
hoe
and
a
want
some
help
offered
he
it
not
gentlemanly
of
you
to
notice
said
i
weakly
i
know
it
said
he
he
came
in
and
inverted
the
on
the
hearth
and
sat
down
upon
it
but
the
door
was
always
open
and
i
could
help
seeing
if
it
was
shoes
and
a
kimono
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
it
was
a
raincoat
and
rubber
boots
sometimes
i
stopped
to
count
the
things
on
that
dressing
it
was
ungentlemanly
of
you
guilty
he
admitted
again
but
not
meekly
there
was
a
sparkle
in
his
eye
but
it
is
often
you
see
that
a
man
gets
a
chance
to
take
notes
like
this
an
open
door
it
an
invitation
to
look
in
now
the
gay
lady
does
leave
her
door
open
except
by
chance
but
i
know
how
it
looks
inside
by
the
gay
lady
herself
how
i
questioned
my
curiosity
getting
the
better
of
me
i
mean
how
can
you
tell
by
the
look
of
the
gay
lady
that
she
keeps
her
room
in
order
for
she
certainly
does
i
knew
it
said
he
triumphantly
but
how
and
i
know
that
you
keep
yours
in
order
but
oh
you
think
we
are
creatures
of
no
discernment
said
he
but
we
can
see
a
few
things
when
a
woman
no
matter
how
pretty
pins
the
back
of
her
collar
with
a
common
brass
pin
i
felt
of
the
back
of
my
white
stock
of
course
i
never
use
them
but
his
eyes
are
so
keen
and
he
laughed
the
philosopher
liked
miss
althea
she
has
many
lovely
qualities
i
began
of
course
that
sort
always
have
it
their
beautiful
that
makes
them
so
easy
on
themselves
er
well
well
the
skeptic
gaze
had
fallen
upon
the
brown
marks
on
the
white
wall
above
the
lamp
there
were
now
in
all
he
got
up
from
his
and
walked
over
to
them
he
stood
and
studied
them
for
a
minute
in
silence
finally
he
turned
around
looked
at
me
made
a
dive
for
the
and
the
hoe
and
hurried
out
of
the
door
i
bring
up
a
pail
of
whitewash
he
called
i
shall
ask
althea
again
some
time
she
really
has
a
great
many
lovely
qualities
as
i
said
to
the
skeptic
but
there
is
a
little
room
i
have
which
i
do
not
call
a
into
which
i
shall
put
althea
it
has
a
sort
of
chocolate
paper
on
the
walls
on
which
i
do
not
think
the
marks
of
matches
would
much
show
and
it
has
a
general
suitableness
to
this
particular
guest
i
have
sometimes
harboured
small
boys
there
for
the
toilet
appointments
are
done
in
red
on
brown
linen
and
curling
irons
could
be
laid
on
them
without
serious
damage
and
i
no
doubt
that
she
would
like
that
room
quite
as
well
ii
camellia
you
thought
to
break
a
country
heart
for
pastime
ere
you
went
to
town
did
you
say
camellia
is
going
to
stop
here
on
her
way
home
asked
the
gay
lady
for
a
few
days
i
assented
the
gay
lady
was
standing
in
front
of
the
closet
in
her
room
in
which
hung
a
row
of
frocks
on
little
hangers
covered
with
pale
blue
ribbon
she
sighed
pensively
as
she
gazed
at
the
garments
then
she
looked
at
me
with
a
smile
would
you
mind
if
i
keep
to
my
room
while
camellia
is
here
she
asked
i
should
mind
very
much
said
i
besides
i
only
two
good
dresses
myself
i
went
down
to
the
porch
camellia
is
going
to
stop
and
make
us
a
short
visit
on
her
way
home
from
the
south
i
announced
the
skeptic
sat
up
great
guns
he
ejaculated
i
must
send
all
my
trousers
to
be
pressed
who
camellia
queried
the
philosopher
looking
up
calmly
from
his
book
wait
and
see
replied
the
skeptic
probably
i
shall
agreed
the
philosopher
meanwhile
a
little
information
might
not
come
amiss
sending
all
one
trousers
to
be
pressed
at
once
sounds
to
me
serious
is
the
lady
a
connoisseur
in
men
attire
she
may
or
may
not
be
said
the
skeptic
the
effect
is
the
same
at
sight
of
her
my
cravat
gets
under
my
ear
my
coat
becomes
shapeless
my
shoes
turn
we
have
to
dress
for
dinner
every
night
when
miss
camellia
is
here
i
wo
said
the
philosopher
shortly
wait
and
see
chuckled
the
skeptic
he
looked
at
me
ask
her
he
added
the
philosopher
fine
blue
eyes
were
lifted
once
more
from
his
book
it
was
a
scientific
book
and
the
habit
of
inquiry
is
always
strong
upon
your
scientist
do
dress
for
dinner
when
miss
camellia
is
here
he
asked
of
me
that
is
i
mean
in
a
way
which
requires
a
of
us
i
think
i
wo
before
she
comes
i
said
afterward
i
get
out
the
best
i
have
which
proves
none
too
good
supplemented
the
skeptic
it
july
said
the
philosopher
thoughtfully
he
looked
down
at
his
white
ducks
could
you
wire
her
not
to
come
he
suggested
after
a
moment
the
skeptic
grinned
at
me
i
shook
my
head
he
shook
his
head
we
do
want
her
not
to
come
he
said
more
cheerfully
she
worth
it
to
see
her
is
a
liberal
education
to
clothe
her
would
be
ruin
and
desolation
brace
up
philo
she
certainly
worth
all
the
agony
of
mind
she
may
cause
you
i
only
refrain
from
falling
head
over
ears
in
love
with
her
by
keeping
my
hand
in
my
pocket
feeling
over
my
loose
change
and
reminding
myself
that
it
all
i
have
and
it
would
buy
her
a
handkerchief
the
gay
lady
spent
the
morning
freshening
her
frocks
which
were
somehow
never
anything
but
fresh
no
matter
how
much
she
wore
them
it
was
true
that
there
were
not
very
many
of
them
and
that
none
of
them
had
cost
very
much
money
but
they
were
fascinating
frocks
nevertheless
and
she
had
so
many
clever
ways
of
varying
them
with
knots
of
ribbon
and
frills
of
lace
that
one
never
grew
tired
of
seeing
her
wear
them
the
skeptic
sent
several
pairs
of
trousers
to
be
pressed
and
a
bundle
of
other
things
to
be
laundered
i
got
out
a
gown
i
had
expected
to
wear
only
on
state
occasions
and
did
something
to
the
sleeves
the
philosopher
was
the
only
person
who
remained
unaffected
by
the
news
that
camellia
was
coming
we
envied
him
his
calm
camellia
arrived
three
trunks
arrived
at
the
same
time
appearance
as
she
came
up
the
porch
steps
while
trim
and
attractive
gave
no
hint
to
the
philosopher
eyes
observant
though
they
were
of
what
was
to
be
expected
he
had
failed
to
note
the
trunks
this
was
not
strange
for
camellia
had
a
beautiful
face
and
her
manner
was
as
always
charming
i
do
see
said
the
philosopher
in
my
ear
at
a
moment
when
camellia
was
occupied
with
the
skeptic
and
the
gay
lady
what
there
is
about
that
to
upset
you
all
do
you
said
i
pityingly
evidently
from
what
he
had
heard
us
say
he
had
expected
her
to
arrive
in
an
elaborate
reception
gown
or
possibly
in
spangles
and
lace
camellia
went
to
her
room
the
white
room
this
time
i
had
no
fears
for
the
embroidered
linen
on
my
or
for
the
purity
of
my
white
wall
i
repaired
to
my
own
room
dress
for
as
i
passed
the
porch
door
on
my
way
i
looked
out
the
gay
lady
had
vanished
so
had
the
skeptic
the
philosopher
was
walking
up
and
down
in
white
ducks
he
hailed
me
as
i
passed
see
here
he
said
under
his
breath
i
thought
you
people
were
all
guying
in
that
talk
about
dressing
for
dinner
while
while
miss
camellia
is
here
but
the
skeptic
has
gone
to
do
it
if
he
not
bluffing
is
it
true
do
you
mean
it
we
that
is
we
have
been
dressing
for
dinner
except
of
course
you
ladies
seem
always
to
but
different
and
it
awfully
hot
he
added
plaintively
do
do
it
said
i
hurriedly
i
do
know
any
reason
why
we
should
in
the
country
in
july
he
looked
at
me
doubtfully
but
is
the
skeptic
going
to
really
i
presume
he
really
is
you
see
he
has
met
camellia
before
he
knows
how
she
will
be
looking
when
she
comes
down
he
admires
camellia
very
much
and
he
might
possibly
feel
a
little
odd
in
tennis
flannels
it
queer
murmured
the
philosopher
but
perhaps
i
better
not
be
behind
in
the
procession
even
if
i
wilt
my
collar
he
fingered
lovingly
the
soft
collar
of
his
white
shirt
with
its
tie
and
sighed
again
then
he
moved
toward
the
stairs
we
were
all
on
the
porch
when
camellia
came
down
the
gay
lady
had
put
on
a
white
muslin
the
finest
simplest
thing
the
philosopher
pushing
a
finger
between
his
collar
and
his
neck
to
see
if
the
wilting
process
had
begun
eyed
the
gay
lady
approvingly
whatever
she
wears
he
whispered
to
her
she
ca
win
over
you
the
gay
lady
laughed
yes
she
can
she
declared
she
did
camellia
was
a
vision
when
she
came
floating
out
upon
the
porch
the
philosopher
was
glad
he
had
on
his
i
saw
it
in
his
eye
the
skeptic
tanned
cheek
turned
a
reddish
shade
he
looked
as
if
he
felt
the
gay
lady
held
her
pretty
head
high
as
she
smiled
approval
on
the
guest
camellia
effect
on
the
gay
lady
was
to
make
her
feel
like
a
she
had
repeatedly
avowed
it
to
me
in
private
camellia
never
seemed
conscious
of
her
fine
attire
that
could
always
truthfully
be
said
although
on
the
present
occasion
she
was
dressed
as
duchesses
dress
for
a
she
seemed
supremely
unconscious
of
the
fact
the
only
trouble
was
that
the
rest
of
us
could
not
be
unconscious
of
it
the
dinner
moved
slowly
we
all
did
our
best
including
the
philosopher
whose
collar
was
slowly
melting
so
that
he
had
to
keep
his
chin
well
up
lest
it
crush
the
linen
hopelessly
beneath
the
skeptic
joked
ceaselessly
but
one
could
see
that
all
the
time
he
feared
his
cravat
might
be
awry
the
dinner
itself
was
a
much
more
formal
affair
than
usual
somehow
that
always
seemed
necessary
when
camellia
was
guest
we
were
glad
when
it
was
over
and
we
could
go
back
to
the
cool
recesses
of
the
porch
the
next
morning
camellia
wore
an
unpretentious
dress
of
white
one
which
made
the
thing
the
gay
lady
had
worn
at
dinner
the
evening
before
seem
to
her
memory
poor
indeed
later
in
the
morning
the
skeptic
took
camellia
boating
on
the
river
and
she
went
up
and
dressed
for
it
in
a
yachting
suit
of
white
flannel
it
was
some
slight
consolation
that
she
came
back
from
the
river
much
bedraggled
about
the
skirts
for
the
boat
had
sprung
a
leak
and
all
the
skeptic
gallantry
could
not
keep
her
dry
but
this
necessitated
a
change
before
luncheon
and
some
of
us
were
nearly
unable
to
eat
with
camellia
sitting
there
in
the
frock
she
had
put
on
at
the
last
minute
she
was
a
dream
in
the
pale
pink
of
it
and
the
skeptic
appeared
to
be
losing
his
head
on
the
contrary
the
philosopher
was
seen
to
examine
her
thoughtfully
through
the
eyeglasses
he
sometimes
wears
for
reading
and
which
he
had
forgotten
to
remove
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
i
discovered
the
gay
lady
mending
a
little
hole
in
the
skirt
of
a
dimity
her
bright
eyes
suspiciously
misty
i
a
i
know
she
explained
smiling
at
me
through
the
mist
but
it
does
make
me
absurdly
envious
my
things
look
so
so
beside
hers
they
not
duddy
i
cried
warmly
but
i
know
what
you
mean
my
very
best
gown
that
i
had
made
in
town
by
lautier
herself
seems
countrified
do
mind
our
things
will
look
quite
right
again
next
week
what
do
you
suppose
she
will
wear
sighed
she
heaven
only
knows
i
answered
feebly
what
she
wore
was
a
french
frock
which
finished
us
all
i
had
fears
for
the
sanity
of
the
skeptic
i
was
sure
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
eating
he
could
not
of
course
sit
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
from
time
to
time
giving
his
loose
change
a
warning
jingle
to
remind
himself
that
he
could
not
buy
her
handkerchiefs
but
the
philosopher
appeared
to
retain
his
i
caught
his
scientific
eye
fixed
upon
the
pearl
necklace
camellia
wore
it
struck
me
that
the
philosopher
and
the
skeptic
had
temporarily
exchanged
characters
in
the
late
afternoon
at
the
end
of
the
sixth
day
camellia
left
us
the
skeptic
and
the
philosopher
came
to
dinner
in
flannels
it
had
grown
slightly
cooler
the
gay
lady
and
i
wore
things
we
had
not
worn
for
a
week
and
i
was
sure
the
gay
lady
had
never
looked
prettier
after
dinner
in
the
early
dusk
we
sat
upon
the
porch
for
some
time
we
were
more
or
less
silent
then
the
skeptic
from
the
depths
of
a
bamboo
lounging
chair
his
legs
stretching
across
the
porch
in
a
relaxed
attitude
they
had
not
worn
for
a
week
heaved
a
sigh
which
seemed
to
struggle
up
from
the
depths
of
his
interior
the
philosopher
rolled
over
in
the
hammock
where
he
had
been
reposing
on
his
back
his
hands
clasped
under
his
head
and
looked
scrutinizingly
at
his
friend
do
take
it
too
hard
he
counselled
gently
it
not
worth
it
i
know
it
replied
the
skeptic
with
another
sigh
but
i
wish
i
were
worth
millions
oh
no
you
do
argued
the
philosopher
the
gay
lady
and
i
exchanged
glances
through
the
twilight
we
would
have
arisen
and
fled
but
the
skeptic
caught
at
my
skirts
do
go
he
begged
i
not
really
insane
only
delirious
wear
off
it
will
agreed
the
philosopher
i
suppose
began
the
skeptic
after
some
further
moments
of
silence
that
it
really
mostly
clothes
she
a
very
charming
girl
said
the
gay
lady
quickly
i
do
blame
you
honestly
said
the
skeptic
sitting
up
and
looking
at
her
do
you
think
her
clothes
are
about
all
there
is
of
her
no
said
the
gay
lady
stoutly
yes
said
the
philosopher
comfortably
yes
and
no
said
i
as
the
skeptic
looked
at
me
a
girl
argued
the
philosopher
suddenly
pulling
himself
out
of
the
hammock
and
beginning
to
pace
the
floor
who
could
come
here
to
this
unpretentious
country
place
with
three
trunks
and
then
wear
their
contents
look
here
he
paused
in
front
of
me
and
looked
at
me
as
piercingly
as
somewhat
blue
eyes
can
look
in
the
twilight
did
she
ever
wear
the
same
thing
twice
i
believe
not
i
admitted
a
girl
who
could
come
to
a
place
like
this
and
make
a
show
figure
of
herself
in
clothes
that
any
fool
could
see
cost
cæsar
what
must
they
cost
and
change
four
times
a
day
and
keep
us
dancing
around
in
starched
collars
you
did
have
to
yes
we
did
pardon
me
we
did
not
to
be
innocently
not
insolently
mistaken
for
farm
hands
i
tell
you
a
girl
like
that
would
keep
a
man
humping
to
furnish
the
wherewithal
for
what
continued
the
philosopher
growing
very
earnest
what
if
she
wear
that
sort
of
clothes
here
would
she
consider
necessary
for
for
visiting
her
rich
friends
tell
me
that
we
could
not
tell
him
that
we
did
not
try
the
gay
lady
was
pinching
one
of
her
little
flowered
dimity
ruffles
into
plaits
with
an
agitated
thumb
and
finger
i
was
sure
the
present
state
of
mind
was
of
more
moment
to
her
than
she
would
ever
let
appear
to
anybody
the
skeptic
rose
slowly
from
his
chair
will
you
walk
down
the
garden
path
with
me
he
asked
the
gay
lady
they
sauntered
slowly
away
into
the
twilight
the
philosopher
came
and
sat
down
by
me
he
not
really
hit
said
he
presently
he
only
temporarily
upset
i
was
a
trifle
bowled
over
myself
she
certainly
a
stunning
girl
but
when
i
try
to
recall
what
she
and
i
talked
about
when
we
sat
out
here
together
at
such
times
as
he
was
willing
to
leave
her
in
my
company
i
have
really
no
recollection
when
it
was
too
dark
to
see
her
clothes
or
her
smile
i
remember
being
once
or
twice
distinctly
bored
now
the
gay
lady
do
you
think
she
always
looks
well
lovely
i
agreed
heartily
i
may
not
know
much
about
it
being
a
man
said
he
modestly
but
i
should
naturally
think
the
gay
lady
clothes
cost
considerably
less
than
miss
camellia
considerably
though
i
never
really
thought
about
them
before
he
owned
i
suppose
a
man
usually
does
think
much
about
a
woman
clothes
unless
he
forced
to
during
this
last
week
it
occurs
to
me
we
been
forced
to
eh
somewhat
i
was
smiling
to
myself
i
had
never
imagined
that
the
philosopher
troubled
himself
with
such
matters
at
all
and
i
do
think
he
went
on
i
like
being
forced
to
spend
my
time
speculating
on
the
cost
of
anybody
how
comfortable
it
is
on
this
porch
and
how
jolly
not
to
have
to
sit
up
in
a
black
coat
on
a
july
evening
the
skeptic
and
the
gay
lady
returned
after
an
hour
the
skeptic
as
he
came
into
the
light
which
streamed
out
across
the
porch
from
the
hall
looked
decidedly
more
cheerful
than
when
he
had
left
us
although
it
had
been
too
dark
in
the
garden
to
see
either
the
gay
lady
clothes
or
her
smile
i
doubted
if
he
had
been
bored
iii
dahlia
o
weary
fa
the
women
for
they
winna
let
a
body
be
my
neighbour
dahlia
has
returned
there
is
a
considerable
stretch
of
lawn
also
a
garden
and
a
small
orchard
intervening
between
her
father
property
and
mine
not
to
mention
a
thick
hedge
but
in
spite
of
these
obstructions
it
did
not
take
dahlia
long
to
discover
that
there
were
guests
upon
my
porch
i
think
she
recognized
the
long
legs
from
her
window
which
looks
down
my
way
through
a
vista
of
at
all
events
on
the
morning
after
her
arrival
she
appeared
coming
through
the
hedge
down
the
garden
path
and
across
the
lawn
a
fresh
and
attractive
figure
in
a
pink
muslin
with
ruffles
and
one
of
those
coquettish
sunbonnets
wear
in
the
country
dahlia
is
very
pretty
very
good
company
and
likable
from
many
points
of
view
if
only
who
this
coming
to
invade
our
completeness
queried
the
philosopher
looking
up
from
his
book
of
trout
flies
fishing
in
its
scientific
aspect
presents
many
attractions
to
our
philosopher
although
he
spends
so
much
time
in
getting
ready
to
do
it
scientifically
that
he
seldom
finds
much
left
in
which
to
fish
the
skeptic
glanced
at
the
figure
coming
over
the
lawn
then
he
made
a
gesture
as
if
he
were
about
to
turn
up
his
coat
collar
he
hitched
himself
slightly
behind
one
of
the
white
pillars
of
the
porch
keep
cool
you
soon
know
he
replied
to
the
philosopher
and
once
knowing
you
always
know
the
philosopher
looked
slightly
mystified
at
this
oracular
information
and
gazed
rather
curiously
at
dahlia
as
she
came
near
before
he
dropped
his
eyes
to
his
trout
flies
the
skeptic
appeared
to
be
absorbed
in
a
letter
which
he
had
hastily
extracted
from
his
pocket
it
was
merely
a
brief
business
communication
in
type
as
i
could
not
help
seeing
over
his
shoulder
but
he
withdrew
his
attention
from
it
with
difficulty
as
dahlia
paused
before
him
her
first
greeting
was
for
him
although
i
had
risen
just
behind
him
oh
how
do
you
do
miss
dahlia
cried
the
skeptic
getting
to
his
feet
and
receiving
her
outstretched
hand
in
his
own
then
he
made
as
if
to
pass
her
on
to
me
but
she
would
be
passed
until
she
had
said
something
under
her
breath
to
him
smiling
up
into
his
face
her
fingers
clinging
to
his
been
er
horribly
busy
i
heard
him
murmur
in
reply
i
thought
his
hand
showed
symptoms
of
letting
go
before
hers
did
i
greeted
dahlia
introducing
her
to
the
gay
lady
who
smiled
at
her
from
over
a
handkerchief
she
was
embroidering
with
my
initials
i
presented
the
philosopher
who
immediately
presented
his
trout
flies
she
scanned
him
closely
the
philosopher
is
very
almost
but
not
quite
than
the
skeptic
then
she
dropped
down
upon
one
of
the
porch
cushions
by
his
side
he
politely
offered
her
a
chair
but
she
insisted
that
she
liked
the
cushion
better
and
we
found
it
impossible
to
doubt
that
she
did
at
all
events
she
remained
upon
it
close
beside
the
philosopher
as
long
as
he
retained
his
position
and
she
appeared
to
become
absorbed
in
the
trout
flies
asking
many
questions
and
exclaiming
over
some
of
them
in
a
way
which
showed
her
to
be
of
a
most
sympathetic
disposition
finally
the
philosopher
seized
upon
an
opportunity
and
rose
well
he
observed
i
believe
i
go
and
try
my
luck
dahlia
looked
up
at
him
her
pretty
face
took
on
a
beseeching
expression
the
philosopher
regarded
her
uncomprehendingly
you
will
excuse
he
began
but
dahlia
did
not
let
him
finish
i
simply
love
to
go
fishing
she
said
softly
do
you
said
the
philosopher
blinking
stupidly
it
is
great
sport
i
think
myself
even
then
i
believe
he
would
have
turned
away
he
is
not
used
to
it
at
least
in
dahlia
style
but
she
detained
him
are
you
really
not
going
to
ask
me
she
said
looking
like
a
disappointed
child
i
saw
the
gay
lady
look
at
her
the
skeptic
glanced
at
the
gay
lady
i
observed
the
skeptic
but
the
philosopher
rose
to
the
occasion
he
is
invariably
courteous
why
certainly
he
responded
if
you
would
really
care
to
go
rather
a
long
walk
to
the
stream
and
i
afraid
the
boat
leaks
considerably
but
oh
i
do
mind
that
she
exulted
jumping
up
her
cheeks
pink
with
delight
in
fact
i
know
that
boat
of
old
she
gave
the
skeptic
a
look
from
under
her
eyelashes
but
he
was
looking
at
the
gay
lady
and
it
failed
to
hit
him
are
you
ready
all
right
and
i
my
sunbonnet
just
the
thing
you
shall
see
what
we
catch
she
called
back
to
us
as
the
two
walked
away
the
skeptic
got
the
pillar
between
himself
and
the
departing
pair
his
face
was
convulsed
with
mirth
he
slapped
his
knee
i
said
he
soon
know
he
chuckled
holding
himself
in
with
an
effort
but
i
think
he
find
out
quite
so
soon
smoke
and
ashes
but
that
was
quick
work
he
turned
about
and
looked
up
at
the
gay
lady
will
you
go
fishing
he
inquired
still
chuckling
no
thank
you
responded
the
gay
lady
smiling
at
her
embroidery
without
looking
up
will
you
go
fishing
the
inquiry
was
directed
at
me
i
shook
my
head
the
skeptic
fell
into
an
attitude
of
mock
despair
then
he
sat
up
going
to
go
down
and
hide
behind
the
big
tree
at
the
bend
he
declared
i
want
to
see
philo
when
she
the
gay
lady
spoke
to
me
do
you
think
i
getting
that
k
too
heavy
she
asked
the
skeptic
laughed
and
strolled
away
not
in
the
direction
of
the
trout
stream
dahlia
and
the
philosopher
came
back
just
as
luncheon
was
served
dahlia
was
looking
pinker
than
ever
and
i
thought
the
philosopher
tan
had
rather
a
pinkish
hue
also
i
felt
obliged
to
ask
dahlia
to
stay
to
luncheon
and
she
promptly
accepted
throughout
the
meal
she
was
very
gay
sitting
at
my
round
table
between
the
philosopher
and
the
skeptic
and
plying
both
with
attentions
it
is
a
singular
phrase
to
use
in
speaking
of
a
girl
but
i
know
no
other
that
applies
so
well
in
dahlia
case
after
luncheon
the
philosopher
bolted
his
movements
are
usually
deliberate
but
i
never
saw
a
quicker
exit
made
from
a
which
has
only
two
doors
one
door
leads
into
the
hall
the
other
to
the
pantry
the
rest
of
us
went
out
the
hall
door
when
we
reached
the
porch
the
philosopher
was
missing
there
is
no
explanation
except
that
he
went
out
by
the
pantry
door
on
the
porch
the
skeptic
said
i
must
run
down
to
the
barn
and
look
after
skylark
foot
he
cut
himself
when
i
was
out
on
him
yesterday
he
hastened
away
down
the
driveway
dahlia
looked
after
him
is
skylark
here
she
asked
oh
how
i
want
to
see
the
dear
thing
and
he
cut
his
foot
i
going
to
run
down
to
the
barn
too
and
see
him
and
she
hurried
away
after
the
skeptic
i
think
i
go
in
and
sleep
a
while
said
the
gay
lady
to
me
her
expressive
lips
had
a
curious
little
twist
of
scorn
i
should
too
if
i
had
a
new
guest
said
i
we
tried
not
to
smile
at
each
other
but
we
could
quite
help
it
the
gay
lady
went
away
to
her
room
i
heard
her
close
the
blinds
on
the
side
that
looked
off
toward
the
barn
and
glancing
up
saw
that
she
had
turned
down
the
slats
tightly
i
think
it
must
have
been
well
on
toward
four
in
the
afternoon
when
the
white
sunbonnet
at
last
disappeared
through
the
gap
in
the
hedge
the
skeptic
came
back
up
the
garden
path
at
the
pace
of
an
escaping
convict
and
went
tearing
up
the
stairs
to
his
room
i
heard
him
splashing
like
a
seal
in
his
bath
presently
he
came
out
freshly
attired
and
went
away
down
the
road
in
the
opposite
direction
from
that
in
which
lay
the
house
beyond
the
hedge
dahlia
came
over
at
twilight
that
evening
to
bring
me
a
great
bunch
of
she
was
captivatingly
arrayed
in
blue
she
remained
for
an
hour
or
so
when
she
went
away
the
skeptic
walked
home
with
her
he
was
forced
to
do
it
the
philosopher
had
disappeared
again
quite
without
warning
some
twenty
minutes
earlier
she
came
over
the
next
afternoon
on
the
day
following
she
practically
took
up
her
residence
with
us
i
thought
of
inviting
her
to
bring
a
trunk
and
occupy
the
white
room
on
the
fourth
night
i
accidentally
overheard
a
brief
but
pregnant
colloquy
which
took
place
just
inside
the
library
door
toward
the
last
of
the
evening
you
got
to
take
her
home
old
man
i
wo
it
was
the
philosopher
you
got
to
it
your
turn
no
shirking
i
be
hanged
if
i
will
i
be
hanged
if
will
there
a
limit
i
always
supposed
there
was
there
does
seem
to
be
come
along
stand
up
to
it
like
a
man
it
up
to
you
she
ca
carry
you
off
bodily
i
not
so
sure
of
that
the
philosopher
tone
was
grim
so
far
i
had
been
transfixed
but
now
i
hurried
away
i
was
consumed
with
anxiety
during
the
next
ten
minutes
lest
they
come
to
blows
in
settling
it
but
when
they
appeared
i
could
tell
that
they
had
settled
it
somehow
when
dahlia
arose
and
said
that
she
positively
must
go
they
both
accompanied
her
the
transit
occupied
less
time
than
it
had
done
on
any
previous
occasion
from
this
time
on
there
was
concerted
action
on
the
part
of
our
two
men
where
one
was
the
other
was
the
gay
lady
and
i
received
less
attention
than
we
were
accustomed
to
expect
the
two
men
were
too
busy
standing
by
each
other
to
have
much
time
for
us
i
so
sorry
said
dahlia
coming
over
after
dinner
on
the
tenth
evening
but
i
going
away
i
an
invitation
that
simply
not
allowed
to
refuse
the
philosopher
face
lit
up
he
attempted
to
conceal
it
by
burying
his
head
in
his
handkerchief
for
a
moment
in
mock
distress
but
his
satisfaction
showed
even
behind
his
ears
the
skeptic
bent
down
and
elaborately
tied
his
the
gay
lady
regarded
dahlia
sweetly
and
said
that
surely
very
nice
for
you
i
think
observed
dahlia
looking
coyly
from
the
skeptic
to
the
philosopher
that
i
shall
have
to
let
each
of
you
take
me
for
a
farewell
walk
you
first
she
indicated
the
philosopher
or
shall
it
be
a
row
for
one
and
a
walk
for
the
other
she
and
the
philosopher
strolled
away
toward
the
river
there
had
been
no
way
out
for
him
the
englishman
the
scotsman
and
the
irishman
began
the
skeptic
in
a
conversational
tone
being
about
to
be
hanged
were
given
their
choice
of
a
tree
oak
for
me
says
the
englishman
scotch
elm
for
mine
says
the
scotsman
says
the
irishman
be
afther
takin
a
gooseberry
bush
too
small
says
the
hangman
wait
for
it
to
grow
says
the
irishman
contentedly
whereat
he
disappeared
when
dahlia
and
the
philosopher
returned
he
had
not
come
back
i
was
amazed
at
him
but
my
amazement
did
not
produce
him
and
the
philosopher
accompanied
dahlia
home
when
they
were
well
away
the
skeptic
swung
himself
up
over
the
side
of
the
porch
from
among
some
bushes
fair
in
love
and
war
he
grinned
besides
the
over
philo
gained
experience
he
a
veteran
now
he
never
be
such
easy
game
again
have
we
behaved
well
on
the
whole
he
asked
the
gay
lady
dropping
upon
a
cushion
at
her
feet
i
do
think
you
have
said
the
gay
lady
gently
we
have
why
not
she
shook
her
head
i
refuse
to
discuss
it
she
said
as
gently
as
before
but
quite
firmly
the
skeptic
sighed
i
sorry
he
declared
you
really
know
i
do
want
to
know
said
the
gay
lady
is
it
a
lovely
lovely
evening
yes
it
a
lovely
evening
said
the
skeptic
looking
up
at
her
it
would
be
delightful
on
the
river
she
shook
her
head
again
not
nicer
than
here
she
answered
the
philosopher
came
back
when
he
was
across
the
lawn
the
skeptic
jumped
up
and
rushed
forward
and
offered
his
shoulder
for
the
philosopher
to
lean
upon
clear
out
said
the
philosopher
shortly
i
glad
to
hear
it
rejoined
the
skeptic
i
feared
you
might
be
clear
in
it
not
your
fault
that
i
not
grunted
the
philosopher
he
dropped
down
upon
the
porch
step
in
an
exhausted
way
the
gay
lady
rose
the
air
is
making
me
sleepy
said
she
in
her
musically
sweet
voice
the
skeptic
and
the
philosopher
looked
after
her
retreating
figure
even
after
it
ceased
to
be
visible
drifting
down
the
wide
central
hall
the
worst
of
it
is
grumbled
the
skeptic
that
an
exhibition
of
that
sort
of
thing
always
makes
the
other
kind
draw
off
for
fear
we
may
possibly
think
they
in
the
same
class
i
too
now
said
and
went
away
to
let
them
have
it
out
between
them
iv
rhodora
youth
on
the
prow
and
pleasure
at
the
helm
this
morning
we
had
a
surprise
grandmother
and
rhodora
drove
over
from
langdale
ten
miles
away
to
spend
two
days
grandmother
does
not
belong
to
us
exclusively
she
is
grandmother
to
a
large
circle
of
people
all
of
whom
are
glad
to
see
her
whenever
they
have
the
opportunity
rhodora
is
a
new
granddaughter
of
the
old
lady
by
which
i
mean
to
say
that
rhodora
never
saw
grandmother
till
a
fortnight
ago
when
the
girl
arrived
to
pay
her
a
visit
i
wanted
to
see
you
people
so
much
explained
rhodora
coming
breezily
upon
the
porch
a
step
or
two
in
advance
of
the
old
lady
that
i
thought
i
drive
over
grandmother
wanted
to
come
too
so
i
brought
her
grandmother
dark
eyebrows
below
her
white
curls
went
up
a
trifle
it
was
quite
evident
that
she
thought
she
had
brought
rhodora
inasmuch
as
the
carriage
the
horses
and
the
old
family
coachman
were
all
her
own
but
she
did
not
correct
the
girl
she
is
a
tiny
little
lady
with
a
gentle
somewhat
hesitating
manner
but
her
black
eyes
are
very
bright
and
she
sees
things
with
almost
as
keen
a
vision
as
lad
himself
the
gay
lady
was
charmed
with
grandmother
she
put
the
frail
visitor
into
the
easiest
chair
on
the
porch
untied
her
smoothed
her
soft
white
curls
and
brought
a
footstool
for
her
little
feet
then
she
sat
by
her
listening
and
talking
doing
much
more
listening
than
talking
leaving
rhodora
to
me
i
sorry
our
men
are
away
i
said
to
rhodora
and
lad
is
with
them
they
went
early
this
morning
to
climb
bluebeard
mountain
and
wo
be
back
till
night
it
is
rather
quiet
here
without
them
are
they
young
and
jolly
inquired
rhodora
they
are
extremely
jolly
as
for
being
young
that
depends
upon
point
of
view
said
i
they
are
between
and
i
believe
pretty
wide
margin
laughed
rhodora
and
how
old
is
lad
fifteen
i
had
the
bad
luck
to
be
stuck
off
with
old
people
all
the
while
lately
remarked
rhodora
she
looked
at
me
as
she
spoke
i
wondered
if
she
considered
me
old
people
then
she
glanced
at
the
gay
lady
how
old
is
she
she
inquired
i
have
never
asked
her
looks
like
a
girl
but
i
guess
she
is
a
real
girl
would
never
settle
down
like
that
to
talk
to
an
old
lady
like
grandmother
she
observed
sagely
i
opened
my
lips
and
closed
them
i
had
known
miss
rhodora
only
about
ten
minutes
and
one
does
not
make
caustic
speeches
to
one
guests
if
one
can
help
it
but
one
does
take
observations
upon
them
i
was
taking
observations
upon
rhodora
she
was
decidedly
a
handsome
girl
handsome
seems
the
word
she
was
rather
large
blooming
in
colour
with
somewhat
strikingly
modeled
features
she
wore
sleeves
to
her
elbows
and
her
arms
were
round
and
firm
she
sat
in
a
nonchalant
attitude
in
which
her
arms
were
considerably
in
evidence
rhodora
said
grandmother
turning
to
look
our
way
did
i
bring
my
little
black
silk
bag
from
the
carriage
did
see
it
replied
rhodora
which
way
is
bluebeard
mountain
she
inquired
of
me
the
gay
lady
and
i
arose
at
the
same
instant
i
went
into
the
house
to
search
for
the
bag
and
when
i
could
not
find
it
the
gay
lady
went
away
down
to
the
red
barn
to
find
if
the
black
silk
bag
had
been
left
in
the
carriage
she
came
back
bringing
it
thank
you
my
dear
said
grandmother
with
a
smile
which
might
have
repaid
anybody
for
a
much
longer
trip
than
that
to
the
carriage
after
a
time
i
managed
to
exchange
places
with
the
gay
lady
feeling
that
rhodora
very
plainly
did
consider
me
an
elderly
person
and
that
in
spite
of
her
confidence
that
the
gay
lady
was
not
a
real
girl
as
girls
of
rhodora
age
use
the
term
she
might
take
her
as
a
substitute
for
one
the
gay
lady
took
rhodora
down
to
the
river
and
out
in
the
boat
i
understood
from
what
i
heard
later
that
the
gay
lady
although
a
fine
oarswoman
did
not
row
rhodora
about
the
river
rhodora
began
by
dropping
into
the
stern
seat
among
the
cushions
but
the
gay
lady
fitted
two
sets
of
oars
into
the
rowlocks
and
offered
rhodora
the
position
of
stroke
the
gay
lady
is
very
sweet
and
courteous
in
manner
but
i
could
quite
understand
that
when
she
offered
the
oars
to
rhodora
rhodora
accepted
them
and
did
her
best
when
they
came
back
it
was
time
for
luncheon
and
i
took
my
guests
to
the
white
room
what
a
cool
reposeful
room
my
dear
said
grandmother
she
patted
her
white
curls
in
front
of
the
mirror
which
is
an
oblong
one
in
which
two
people
can
not
well
see
themselves
at
the
same
time
rhodora
came
up
behind
her
stooped
to
peer
over
her
shoulder
and
seized
upon
the
ivory
comb
which
lay
on
the
her
elbow
as
she
ran
the
comb
through
her
fluffy
hair
struck
delicate
shoulder
the
old
lady
turned
and
regarded
her
granddaughter
in
astonishment
want
the
comb
inquired
rhodora
having
finished
with
it
herself
rhodora
went
over
to
the
washstand
and
washed
and
splashed
and
used
one
of
the
towels
and
threw
it
back
upon
the
rack
so
that
it
overhung
all
the
other
fresh
towels
grandmother
used
one
end
of
rhodora
towel
and
carefully
folded
and
put
it
in
place
looking
regretfully
at
its
rumpled
condition
she
took
a
clean
out
of
her
bag
rhodora
caught
sight
of
it
oh
grandmother
have
you
got
a
spare
handkerchief
she
cried
lost
mine
i
afraid
grandmother
handed
her
the
little
square
of
fine
linen
exquisitely
embroidered
with
her
own
monogram
and
took
another
and
plainer
one
from
her
bag
try
not
to
lose
that
one
granddaughter
she
said
in
her
gentle
way
rhodora
pushed
it
inside
her
sleeve
oh
i
seldom
lose
two
in
one
day
she
assured
the
handkerchief
owner
i
fear
it
was
rather
a
dull
afternoon
for
rhodora
the
gay
lady
took
grandmother
away
after
luncheon
into
the
quiet
library
and
tucked
her
up
on
the
couch
and
covered
her
with
a
little
silk
quilt
from
her
own
room
and
went
away
and
played
softly
upon
the
piano
in
the
distance
until
the
old
lady
fell
asleep
late
in
the
afternoon
grandmother
awoke
much
refreshed
and
found
the
gay
lady
sitting
by
the
window
keeping
guard
it
does
one
eyes
good
to
look
at
you
my
dear
were
first
words
after
she
had
lain
for
some
time
quietly
observing
the
figure
by
the
window
freshly
dressed
in
white
the
gay
lady
got
up
and
came
over
to
the
couch
and
bent
down
smiling
just
in
time
for
a
late
dinner
our
men
came
home
sunburned
and
hungry
seeing
guests
upon
the
porch
they
made
for
their
rooms
and
reappeared
presently
in
that
irreproachable
trim
which
the
dustiest
and
most
of
them
seems
able
to
achieve
being
given
plenty
of
water
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
they
were
presented
to
grandmother
at
almost
the
same
moment
we
were
summoned
to
dinner
the
skeptic
gave
the
old
lady
his
arm
the
philosopher
picked
up
her
black
silk
bag
from
the
porch
floor
and
followed
with
it
dangling
from
his
hand
just
as
she
reached
the
table
she
dropped
her
handkerchief
and
the
lad
sprang
for
it
as
a
retriever
springs
for
a
stick
and
handed
it
to
her
with
his
best
boyish
bow
the
old
lady
beamed
quite
evidently
this
was
the
sort
of
thing
to
which
she
was
accustomed
at
luncheon
rhodora
had
rather
monopolized
the
conversation
at
dinner
she
found
herself
unable
to
do
so
the
philosopher
and
the
skeptic
were
too
much
occupied
with
grandmother
to
be
able
to
attend
to
rhodora
beyond
lending
a
polite
ear
to
her
remarks
now
and
then
and
immediately
afterward
returning
to
the
elderly
guest
grandmother
was
really
a
most
interesting
talker
when
occasion
required
it
of
her
as
it
certainly
did
now
we
were
all
charmed
with
her
clever
way
of
putting
things
her
shrewd
observation
her
knowledge
of
and
interest
in
affairs
in
general
after
dinner
the
philosopher
escorted
her
out
to
her
chair
on
the
porch
the
skeptic
sat
down
beside
the
gay
lady
on
a
wide
wooden
settle
close
by
and
both
listened
smiling
to
the
discussion
which
had
arisen
between
grandmother
and
the
philosopher
it
was
well
worth
listening
to
the
philosopher
while
wholly
deferential
held
his
ground
staunchly
but
grandmother
worsted
him
in
the
end
her
cheeks
grew
pink
her
black
eyes
shone
it
was
a
captivating
spectacle
i
called
rhodora
attention
to
it
finding
nobody
else
to
do
her
honour
she
had
entered
into
conversation
with
the
lad
both
looked
up
as
i
spoke
to
them
yes
is
she
great
agreed
the
lad
softly
nicest
old
lady
i
ever
saw
it
too
exciting
for
her
i
should
say
commented
her
granddaughter
i
did
think
she
ought
to
come
i
could
have
come
alone
just
as
well
i
a
good
deal
rather
she
getting
pretty
old
the
skeptic
and
the
philosopher
each
did
his
duty
by
rhodora
before
the
evening
was
over
the
skeptic
played
four
sets
of
tennis
with
her
she
is
an
admirable
player
but
he
beat
her
until
he
discovered
that
she
was
growing
very
much
annoyed
then
he
allowed
her
to
win
the
last
set
by
a
game
the
lad
who
was
watching
the
bout
announced
it
to
me
under
his
breath
with
a
laugh
then
the
philosopher
took
rhodora
through
the
garden
and
over
the
place
generally
i
think
you
should
have
a
shawl
about
your
shoulders
rhodora
said
grandmother
when
the
girl
and
the
philosopher
had
returned
and
taken
their
seats
upon
the
steps
of
the
porch
the
twilight
had
fallen
and
the
gay
lady
had
just
wrapped
grandmother
in
a
light
garment
of
her
own
rhodora
shrugged
her
shoulders
heavens
no
she
ejaculated
old
people
are
always
fussing
she
remarked
in
a
slightly
lower
tone
to
the
philosopher
because
she
frozen
is
no
reason
why
i
should
be
one
could
almost
pretend
to
be
frozen
to
please
her
returned
the
philosopher
in
a
much
lower
tone
than
rhodora
she
is
the
most
beautiful
old
lady
i
ever
saw
goodness
i
do
see
how
you
can
see
anything
beautiful
about
old
persons
said
the
girl
they
give
me
the
creeps
the
philosopher
opened
his
mouth
and
closed
it
again
quite
as
i
had
done
in
the
morning
he
looked
curiously
at
rhodora
by
his
expression
i
should
judge
he
was
thinking
after
all
what
the
use
the
next
afternoon
grandmother
and
rhodora
went
home
when
grandmother
was
in
the
carriage
the
skeptic
tucked
her
in
and
put
cushions
behind
her
back
and
a
footstool
under
her
feet
then
the
philosopher
laid
a
great
nosegay
of
garden
flowers
in
her
lap
she
was
so
pleased
she
coloured
like
a
girl
and
put
out
her
delicate
little
old
hand
in
its
black
silk
mitt
and
he
took
it
in
both
his
and
held
it
close
for
a
minute
looking
at
her
with
his
blue
eyes
full
of
such
a
boyish
expression
of
affection
as
his
own
mother
might
have
seen
now
and
then
years
before
i
think
she
would
have
liked
to
kiss
him
and
i
am
sure
he
wanted
to
kiss
her
but
we
were
all
looking
on
and
they
had
known
each
other
but
a
few
hours
nevertheless
there
was
something
about
the
little
scene
which
touched
us
all
except
rhodora
who
exclaimed
gracious
grandmother
i
suppose
that
brings
back
the
days
when
you
had
lots
of
beaux
what
a
gorgeous
jumble
of
flowers
that
is
anyhow
i
did
know
there
were
so
many
kinds
in
the
world
the
skeptic
hustled
her
into
the
carriage
rather
as
if
she
were
a
bag
of
meal
handed
her
belongings
in
after
her
shook
hands
with
grandmother
in
his
most
courtly
fashion
and
stood
aside
we
waved
our
hands
and
handkerchiefs
and
grandmother
fat
old
horses
walked
away
with
her
down
the
driveway
it
a
pity
said
the
skeptic
to
me
impatiently
when
they
were
out
of
sight
around
the
corner
and
we
had
turned
to
go
back
to
the
house
that
a
girl
like
that
ca
see
herself
rhodora
is
very
young
yet
said
i
perhaps
by
the
time
she
is
even
as
old
as
the
gay
lady
you
do
think
it
declared
the
skeptic
looking
ahead
at
the
gay
lady
as
she
walked
by
the
philosopher
over
the
lawn
toward
the
house
the
two
are
no
more
the
same
sort
than
he
looked
toward
the
garden
for
inspiration
and
found
it
as
many
a
man
before
him
has
found
it
when
searching
after
similes
for
the
women
he
knows
than
those
yellow
of
yours
are
like
a
clump
of
hepaticas
that
you
find
in
the
woods
in
spring
that
evening
the
gay
lady
had
left
us
as
she
sometimes
does
and
gone
in
to
play
soft
melodies
on
my
piano
while
the
rest
of
us
sat
silently
listening
the
men
know
well
enough
that
it
is
useless
to
follow
her
in
when
she
goes
to
play
in
the
twilight
if
they
did
she
would
send
them
back
again
or
stop
playing
and
as
it
is
worth
much
to
hear
her
play
when
she
has
a
certain
mood
upon
her
nobody
does
anything
to
break
the
spell
sometimes
the
listening
grows
almost
painful
but
before
we
are
quite
overwrought
she
comes
back
and
makes
us
gay
again
when
i
was
a
boy
said
the
skeptic
very
softly
to
me
after
the
music
stopped
i
used
to
pick
out
men
to
admire
and
follow
about
and
consume
myself
with
wishing
that
some
day
i
could
be
like
them
how
could
a
girl
like
that
one
we
had
here
look
at
our
gay
lady
and
not
want
to
copy
her
to
the
last
hair
on
her
head
there
are
some
things
which
ca
be
copied
i
returned
she
is
one
of
them
the
skeptic
gave
me
a
grateful
glance
you
never
said
a
truer
thing
than
that
said
he
perceiving
that
he
was
in
a
sentimental
mood
and
that
the
gay
lady
had
stopped
playing
and
was
coming
out
again
upon
the
porch
i
turned
my
attention
to
the
philosopher
in
spite
of
the
music
he
seemed
not
in
a
sentimental
mood
you
have
a
lot
of
girl
company
first
and
last
do
you
he
queried
when
he
and
i
had
agreed
upon
the
beauty
of
the
night
it
happens
so
for
some
reason
i
admitted
he
shook
his
head
regretfully
if
i
thought
you
were
going
to
have
anything
more
like
that
soon
i
should
take
to
the
woods
said
he
v
azalea
it
all
depends
upon
a
consciousness
of
values
a
sense
of
proportion
christopher
the
heavens
have
fallen
i
announced
in
the
doorway
of
the
gay
room
cook
is
ill
i
had
the
doctor
for
her
in
the
night
and
my
little
waitress
went
home
just
yesterday
to
her
sister
wedding
and
breakfast
to
get
responded
the
gay
lady
arriving
instantly
at
the
point
as
she
always
does
she
had
been
dressing
leisurely
now
she
made
all
speed
and
instead
of
white
linen
she
slipped
into
a
gingham
do
worry
i
be
down
in
three
minutes
she
assured
me
cheerily
i
found
lad
building
the
kitchen
fire
in
the
country
we
do
not
have
gas
ranges
i
have
her
roaring
in
a
jiff
he
cried
i
learned
a
dandy
way
camping
last
year
breakfast
came
off
nearly
on
schedule
time
the
gay
lady
omelet
was
a
feathery
success
her
coffee
perfect
my
muffins
above
reproach
lad
had
helped
set
the
table
he
had
looked
over
the
fruit
he
had
skimmed
the
cream
azalea
came
in
a
little
late
she
had
been
my
guest
for
a
week
and
a
delightful
guest
too
she
has
a
glorious
voice
for
singing
and
she
is
very
clever
and
entertaining
everybody
likes
her
of
course
when
i
arose
to
take
away
the
and
bring
on
the
breakfast
the
fact
that
i
was
servantless
came
out
to
the
philosopher
and
the
skeptic
who
were
immediately
solicitous
i
explained
that
we
should
get
on
very
well
we
see
that
you
do
promised
the
skeptic
there
are
a
few
things
i
flatter
myself
i
can
do
as
well
as
the
next
man
or
woman
consider
me
at
your
service
the
same
here
declared
the
philosopher
and
i
say
do
fuss
too
much
have
a
cold
lunch
bread
and
milk
you
know
or
something
like
that
i
smiled
and
said
that
would
not
be
necessary
nor
was
it
for
five
years
after
my
marriage
i
had
been
my
own
and
those
were
happy
days
my
right
hand
had
by
no
means
forgotten
her
cunning
as
for
both
the
gay
lady
pretty
hands
they
were
very
accomplished
in
household
arts
and
she
had
put
on
the
gingham
i
can
wipe
dishes
offered
the
philosopher
as
we
rose
from
the
table
it
a
useful
art
said
the
gay
lady
in
ten
minutes
we
be
ready
for
you
the
skeptic
looked
about
him
then
he
hurried
away
without
saying
anything
two
minutes
later
i
found
him
making
his
bed
go
away
he
commanded
me
it
be
never
fear
you
remember
i
was
sent
to
a
military
school
when
i
was
a
youngster
from
below
as
i
made
azalea
bed
the
strains
of
one
of
the
liszt
hungarian
rhapsodies
floated
up
to
me
azalea
was
playing
we
had
fallen
into
the
habit
of
drifting
into
the
where
the
piano
stood
every
morning
immediately
after
breakfast
to
hear
azalea
play
in
the
evenings
she
sang
to
us
but
one
does
not
sing
directly
after
breakfast
and
only
second
in
delight
to
hearing
azalea
superb
voice
was
listening
to
her
matchless
touch
upon
the
keyboard
i
said
to
myself
as
i
went
about
the
upstairs
work
work
that
the
skeptic
with
all
his
good
will
could
not
do
not
being
allowed
to
cross
certain
thresholds
that
we
should
sorely
miss
azalea
music
when
she
should
go
away
next
week
the
gay
lady
and
i
managed
luncheon
with
very
little
exertion
we
had
so
much
assistance
dinner
cost
us
rather
more
trouble
for
cook
dinners
are
always
delicious
and
we
could
not
have
a
falling
off
under
our
régime
but
it
was
a
great
success
and
our
men
praised
us
until
we
felt
our
labours
fully
repaid
still
we
were
a
trifle
fatigued
at
the
end
of
the
day
cook
had
needed
a
good
deal
of
waiting
upon
and
though
the
gay
lady
had
insisted
on
sharing
this
service
with
me
it
had
required
many
steps
and
the
exercise
of
some
tact
cook
having
been
fully
persuaded
all
day
that
her
end
was
near
i
have
told
her
six
times
that
people
do
die
of
lumbago
said
the
gay
lady
but
her
tears
flow
just
as
copiously
as
ever
i
written
three
letters
to
her
friends
for
her
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
write
her
last
will
and
testament
but
on
the
morrow
cook
was
enough
better
to
be
able
to
indite
her
own
documents
though
as
yet
unable
to
come
downstairs
it
was
well
that
she
did
not
require
much
of
our
time
however
for
just
before
noon
a
party
of
touring
motorists
drove
up
to
our
door
and
precipitated
themselves
upon
us
with
warm
greetings
and
hungry
looks
toward
our
smoke
and
ashes
cried
the
skeptic
under
his
breath
appearing
in
the
kitchen
whither
the
gay
lady
and
i
had
betaken
ourselves
as
soon
as
we
had
furnished
our
guests
with
soap
and
water
and
and
left
them
to
remove
as
much
of
the
dust
of
the
road
from
their
persons
as
could
be
done
without
a
full
bath
why
did
you
send
them
on
to
the
village
inn
of
all
the
nerve
and
you
do
know
any
of
them
intimately
do
you
i
shook
my
head
one
of
them
was
my
dearest
enemy
in
i
admitted
and
i
never
saw
but
one
of
the
others
never
mind
do
you
suppose
you
could
saddle
skylark
and
post
over
to
town
for
some
beefsteak
i
sent
lad
to
the
neighbours
for
other
things
beefsteak
is
what
they
must
have
porterhouse
since
i
not
enough
broilers
in
the
to
go
around
that
hungry
company
sure
thing
and
the
skeptic
was
off
but
he
came
back
to
say
in
my
ear
see
here
why
does
miss
azalea
come
out
and
help
she
just
sitting
on
the
porch
looking
pretty
somebody
ought
to
play
hostess
since
i
must
be
here
i
responded
without
meeting
his
inquiring
eye
i
did
urgently
need
some
one
to
beat
the
oil
into
the
salad
dressing
i
was
making
for
there
were
other
things
i
must
do
the
gay
lady
was
already
accomplishing
separate
things
with
each
hand
and
directing
lad
at
the
same
time
the
skeptic
looked
at
her
appreciatively
she
mourns
because
she
ca
sing
said
he
and
laughed
quietly
to
himself
as
he
swung
away
yet
he
had
seemed
much
impressed
with
azalea
singing
all
the
week
and
had
turned
her
music
for
her
devotedly
we
got
through
it
somehow
i
thought
they
eat
their
heads
off
commented
the
philosopher
who
had
carved
the
beefsteak
and
the
broilers
and
had
tried
to
give
everybody
the
tenderloin
and
the
white
breast
meat
and
had
eaten
drumsticks
and
end
pieces
himself
after
the
manner
of
the
unselfish
host
there
were
piles
and
mountains
of
dishes
after
that
luncheon
they
looked
the
bigger
to
us
because
we
had
been
obliged
to
leave
them
for
two
hours
while
we
sat
upon
the
porch
with
our
motorists
who
said
they
always
took
a
good
rest
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
made
up
by
running
many
extra
miles
at
night
when
they
had
gone
loudly
grateful
for
our
hospitality
two
of
the
men
had
had
to
have
some
more
things
to
eat
and
drink
before
they
could
get
up
steam
with
which
to
start
the
gay
lady
and
i
stood
in
the
door
of
the
kitchen
and
drew
our
first
sighs
over
the
state
of
things
existing
if
cook
does
get
down
pretty
soon
said
i
dejectedly
and
did
not
try
to
finish
the
sentence
somehow
that
hasty
cookery
for
five
extra
people
had
been
depressing
i
could
think
of
a
thing
that
had
been
left
in
the
house
that
would
do
for
dinner
due
now
in
three
short
hours
but
the
gay
lady
rallied
nobly
there
plenty
of
hot
water
said
she
and
those
dishes
will
melt
away
in
no
time
then
you
going
to
have
a
long
sleep
whether
we
get
any
dinner
or
not
the
skeptic
spoke
from
behind
us
here
a
fresh
recruit
said
he
in
a
jovial
tone
which
i
understood
at
once
was
manufactured
for
the
occasion
we
looked
around
and
saw
azalea
at
his
elbow
she
was
smiling
rather
dubiously
i
wondered
how
he
had
managed
it
afterward
i
learned
that
he
had
boldly
asked
her
if
she
did
want
to
help
i
hope
i
sha
break
anything
murmured
azalea
accepting
a
the
skeptic
took
another
oh
no
he
assured
her
that
delicate
touch
of
yours
why
i
never
heard
anybody
who
could
play
like
you
you
would
break
a
rainbow
azalea
did
not
break
anything
i
think
it
was
because
she
did
not
dry
more
than
one
article
to
the
skeptic
three
and
the
gay
lady
six
once
she
dropped
a
china
cup
but
the
skeptic
caught
it
and
presented
it
to
her
with
a
bow
do
mention
it
said
he
i
an
old
the
philosopher
came
through
the
kitchen
with
a
broom
and
dustpan
he
had
been
attempting
to
sweep
the
floor
which
is
of
hardwood
with
a
centre
rug
and
had
had
a
bad
time
of
it
the
skeptic
jeered
at
him
and
mentioned
the
implements
he
should
have
used
azalea
looked
at
them
both
wonderingly
how
in
the
world
do
you
men
come
to
know
so
much
about
housework
she
inquired
wiping
a
single
teaspoon
diligently
the
gay
lady
had
just
lifted
a
dozen
out
of
the
steaming
pan
for
her
but
azalea
had
laid
them
all
down
on
the
table
and
was
polishing
them
one
by
one
i
find
it
comes
in
handy
said
the
skeptic
you
never
stay
anywhere
you
know
that
sooner
or
later
something
does
happen
unexpectedly
to
the
domestic
machinery
besides
i
like
to
show
off
do
you
see
here
he
turned
to
me
there
was
a
twinkle
in
his
wicked
eye
see
here
why
not
let
miss
azalea
and
me
be
responsible
for
the
dinner
with
philo
as
second
assistant
you
and
the
gay
lady
are
tired
out
miss
azalea
can
tell
me
what
to
do
and
i
promise
to
do
it
faithfully
he
had
not
the
face
to
look
at
the
guest
as
he
made
this
daring
suggestion
his
audacity
took
my
breath
away
so
completely
that
i
could
make
no
rejoinder
but
the
gay
lady
came
to
the
rescue
i
do
know
whether
she
had
seen
azalea
face
but
i
had
i
have
a
surprise
for
said
she
picking
up
a
trayful
of
china
and
i
do
intend
anybody
shall
interfere
with
it
nobody
is
even
to
mention
dinner
in
my
presence
the
skeptic
took
the
tray
away
from
her
there
are
some
other
things
i
should
like
to
mention
in
your
presence
said
he
so
softly
that
i
think
nobody
heard
him
but
myself
who
was
nearest
and
one
of
them
is
that
somebody
i
know
never
looked
sweeter
than
she
does
this
i
rattled
the
saucers
in
the
pan
that
nobody
might
catch
it
the
gay
lady
was
colouring
so
brilliantly
that
i
feared
the
skeptic
might
drop
the
tray
for
he
was
not
looking
at
all
where
he
was
going
but
she
disappeared
into
the
pantry
and
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
to
do
but
to
place
the
tray
on
the
shelf
outside
ready
for
her
to
take
the
contents
in
through
the
window
the
gay
lady
put
me
upon
my
own
bed
tucked
me
up
drew
the
curtains
and
left
me
to
my
nap
she
left
a
kiss
on
my
cheek
also
and
as
she
dropped
it
there
i
thought
of
the
skeptic
again
i
do
know
why
i
wondered
casually
what
he
would
give
for
one
like
it
when
i
awoke
my
room
was
so
nearly
dark
that
i
was
startled
into
thinking
it
next
morning
the
lad
voice
speaking
eagerly
through
my
door
was
what
had
roused
me
he
was
summoning
me
to
dinner
it
all
ready
he
was
calling
i
dressed
dazedly
refreshed
and
wondering
i
went
down
to
preside
at
the
most
delicious
meal
i
had
eaten
in
a
month
the
gay
lady
in
white
muslin
with
cheeks
like
roses
seemed
not
in
the
least
fatigued
the
skeptic
looked
like
a
young
commanding
general
who
had
seen
his
forces
win
triumphantly
against
great
odds
the
philosopher
was
hilarious
azalea
seemed
somewhat
quiet
and
thoughtful
when
the
dishes
were
done
and
the
kitchen
in
order
matters
which
were
dispatched
like
wildfire
we
gathered
upon
the
porch
as
usual
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
i
should
like
so
much
said
the
gay
lady
presently
from
the
low
chair
where
she
sat
with
the
skeptic
on
a
cushion
so
near
to
her
feet
that
in
the
shadow
his
big
figure
seemed
to
melt
into
her
slight
one
as
some
music
is
it
asking
too
much
dear
after
all
those
dishes
i
do
feel
a
bit
like
singing
answered
azalea
the
philosopher
sat
beside
her
on
the
settle
and
he
turned
to
add
his
request
to
the
gay
lady
the
skeptic
spoke
heartily
from
his
cushion
if
you
knew
how
much
pleasure
you
given
us
all
these
mornings
and
evenings
he
said
never
having
to
be
urged
but
being
so
generous
with
your
great
art
somehow
it
does
look
so
great
to
me
said
azalea
quietly
i
almost
thought
there
were
tears
in
her
voice
she
has
a
beautiful
speaking
voice
as
singers
are
apt
to
have
everybody
was
silent
for
an
instant
in
surprise
and
anxiety
azalea
was
a
very
lovely
girl
nobody
had
meant
to
hurt
her
had
the
skeptic
shot
in
the
kitchen
gone
home
nobody
would
be
sorrier
than
he
to
deal
a
blow
where
only
a
feather
touch
was
meant
it
looks
so
great
to
me
said
the
gay
lady
very
gently
that
i
would
give
years
of
my
life
to
be
able
to
sing
one
song
as
you
sing
beethoven
of
course
i
ca
refuse
after
that
said
azalea
modestly
though
more
happily
i
thought
and
the
philosopher
went
away
with
her
into
the
living
room
may
i
say
anything
asked
the
skeptic
looking
up
into
the
gay
face
in
the
way
he
has
when
he
wants
to
say
things
very
much
but
is
doubtful
how
she
will
take
them
a
condition
he
is
frequently
in
she
shook
her
head
i
think
she
must
have
been
smiling
it
was
so
evident
that
which
he
wanted
to
say
he
wanted
to
assure
her
that
her
own
accomplishments
but
the
gay
lady
shook
her
head
let
just
listen
she
said
so
we
listened
it
was
worth
it
but
after
all
i
doubt
if
the
skeptic
heard
vi
hepatica
here
metal
more
attractive
the
gay
lady
had
gone
away
for
a
week
and
a
day
although
four
of
us
remained
the
gap
in
our
number
appeared
prodigious
the
first
dinner
without
her
seemed
as
slow
and
dull
as
a
dance
without
music
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
we
did
our
best
each
one
of
us
not
to
act
as
if
anything
were
wrong
when
we
had
escaped
from
the
to
the
porch
lad
was
the
first
to
voice
his
sentiments
upon
the
subject
of
our
drooping
spirits
i
did
know
her
being
here
made
such
a
lot
of
difference
till
she
got
away
he
said
dismally
there
nobody
to
laugh
now
when
i
make
a
joke
do
the
rest
of
us
laugh
at
your
jokes
son
inquired
the
philosopher
laying
a
friendly
hand
upon
the
lad
arm
as
the
boy
stood
on
the
porch
step
below
him
you
do
if
she
does
replied
lad
lots
of
times
you
never
notice
what
i
say
if
she
did
look
at
you
and
laugh
then
you
burst
out
and
laugh
too
to
please
her
i
suppose
he
added
the
philosopher
glanced
at
me
over
the
boy
head
here
a
pretty
sharp
observer
said
he
with
a
gift
at
analysis
i
did
know
before
that
i
take
my
cue
from
the
gay
lady
or
from
any
one
else
when
it
comes
to
laughing
at
jokes
try
me
with
one
now
lad
and
see
if
i
laugh
all
by
myself
lad
shook
his
head
that
would
be
any
good
i
know
you
did
mean
it
she
always
means
it
besides
she
thinks
things
are
funny
that
you
do
she
as
good
as
a
boy
and
i
do
see
how
she
can
be
either
he
reflected
because
she
is
the
least
bit
like
one
you
right
enough
about
that
observed
the
philosopher
essentially
feminine
if
ever
a
girl
was
girl
repeated
the
lad
she
is
a
girl
that
is
i
thought
she
was
till
she
told
me
herself
she
was
she
the
philosopher
grinned
the
skeptic
who
had
lit
his
pipe
and
was
puffing
away
at
it
sitting
on
the
settle
with
his
back
to
the
sunset
which
was
unusually
fine
that
evening
gave
utterance
to
a
deep
note
of
derision
at
the
lad
point
of
view
i
smiled
myself
if
ever
there
was
an
irresistible
combination
of
the
girlish
and
the
womanly
it
was
to
be
found
in
our
gay
lady
as
to
her
looks
even
the
blooming
youth
of
althea
and
the
more
cultivated
charms
of
camellia
had
not
made
the
gay
lady
less
lovely
in
our
eyes
although
she
was
by
no
means
what
is
known
as
a
beauty
she
a
whole
lot
nicer
than
any
of
those
girls
we
had
here
this
summer
the
lad
went
on
he
seemed
to
have
the
floor
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
subject
of
his
musings
was
of
interest
to
all
his
hearers
and
they
were
so
bad
either
except
dahlia
i
ca
stand
her
he
added
resentfully
the
philosopher
shook
his
head
slightly
as
one
who
would
have
said
who
could
if
it
had
been
allowable
the
skeptic
removed
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
gazed
intently
into
its
bowl
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
stand
by
dahlia
for
the
sake
of
the
lad
who
must
not
learn
to
sneer
at
women
behind
their
backs
there
are
a
great
many
nice
things
about
dahlia
i
said
and
she
has
surely
given
you
many
good
times
lad
think
how
often
she
has
gone
out
on
the
river
with
you
and
helped
you
make
kites
and
rigged
little
ships
for
you
oh
yes
cried
the
lad
scornfully
she
take
me
when
she
ca
get
a
man
the
skeptic
shoulders
heaved
as
he
turned
away
to
cough
violently
evidently
he
had
swallowed
a
pipeful
of
smoke
the
philosopher
abruptly
removed
his
hand
from
the
lad
shoulder
and
dropped
down
on
the
porch
step
where
his
face
was
hidden
from
the
bright
young
eyes
above
him
i
shook
my
head
at
lad
presently
he
ran
off
to
the
red
barn
to
look
after
some
small
puppies
down
there
in
the
hay
we
three
left
behind
settled
down
for
the
evening
at
least
i
did
and
the
others
made
a
show
of
doing
so
but
the
skeptic
was
both
restless
and
moody
the
philosopher
unsociable
finally
the
skeptic
flung
an
invitation
to
the
philosopher
to
go
off
for
a
walk
the
philosopher
consented
with
a
nod
and
they
strolled
away
taking
leave
of
me
with
formal
politeness
i
understood
them
and
i
did
not
mind
a
wise
woman
lets
a
man
go
that
he
may
return
they
came
back
just
as
twilight
darkened
into
night
and
sat
down
at
my
feet
on
the
step
shoulder
to
shoulder
like
the
good
comrades
that
they
were
i
wondered
if
they
had
been
discussing
the
subject
which
the
lad
had
introduced
how
much
inquired
the
philosopher
quite
suddenly
do
you
suppose
it
would
cost
to
dress
a
girl
like
miss
camellia
i
really
no
idea
i
answered
since
the
question
seemed
directed
at
me
it
depends
on
a
number
of
things
there
are
girls
so
clever
with
their
needles
that
they
can
produce
very
remarkable
effects
for
a
comparatively
small
amount
of
money
is
she
one
of
them
i
do
know
i
fancy
you
do
was
his
comment
presently
he
went
on
again
you
see
i
do
know
much
about
all
this
he
declared
so
i
had
rather
an
observant
eye
on
on
these
young
ladies
you
had
here
from
time
to
time
this
summer
and
i
confess
i
filled
with
curiosity
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
you
think
the
average
girl
of
good
family
and
well
brought
up
has
in
her
mind
eye
as
a
desirable
future
i
mean
for
the
next
few
years
after
school
i
do
know
that
i
make
myself
clear
what
i
want
to
get
at
is
you
see
the
great
thing
a
young
chap
thinks
about
is
what
he
is
going
to
make
of
himself
and
how
to
do
it
it
struck
me
as
rather
odd
that
not
one
of
those
girls
seemed
to
have
any
particular
end
in
view
at
least
that
ever
came
out
in
her
conversation
i
could
help
smiling
his
tone
was
so
serious
the
skeptic
chuckled
he
had
put
up
his
pipe
and
was
sitting
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
head
as
he
leaned
against
one
of
the
great
pillars
of
the
porch
they
have
one
just
the
same
he
vouchsafed
he
who
runs
may
read
the
philosopher
regarded
him
thoughtfully
through
the
from
the
hall
lamp
i
noticed
you
did
a
good
deal
of
running
first
and
last
he
observed
i
suppose
you
read
before
you
ran
unless
you
have
eyes
in
the
back
of
your
head
well
he
continued
you
ca
make
me
believe
that
all
girls
are
so
anxious
to
make
a
good
impression
or
they
would
do
some
of
the
things
they
do
for
instance
i
suggested
having
become
curious
myself
never
before
in
an
acquaintance
dating
far
back
had
i
heard
the
philosopher
hold
forth
upon
this
subject
they
make
themselves
conspicuous
said
he
promptly
to
my
great
surprise
as
nearly
as
i
can
get
at
it
that
the
cardinal
fault
of
the
girl
of
everywhere
i
go
i
notice
it
in
public
in
private
wherever
she
is
she
holds
the
floor
occupies
the
centre
of
the
stage
if
you
pardon
my
saying
it
every
last
girl
you
had
here
this
summer
did
that
thing
each
in
her
own
way
i
thought
about
them
one
after
another
it
was
true
each
had
in
her
own
way
occupied
the
centre
of
the
stage
and
the
gay
lady
than
whom
nobody
has
a
better
right
to
keep
fast
hold
of
her
position
in
the
foreground
of
all
our
thoughts
had
allowed
each
one
to
do
it
and
somehow
in
every
case
after
all
the
real
focus
for
all
our
eyes
quite
without
her
being
able
to
help
it
had
been
wherever
the
gay
lady
had
happened
to
be
we
all
went
to
bed
early
that
night
the
philosopher
observations
though
highly
interesting
did
not
keep
us
from
becoming
very
sleepy
at
an
untimely
hour
it
was
the
same
way
next
evening
and
the
next
in
fact
up
to
the
very
night
before
the
gay
lady
expected
return
we
continued
to
cut
short
our
days
of
waiting
by
as
much
as
we
could
venture
to
do
without
exciting
the
suspicion
that
we
were
weary
of
one
another
on
that
last
evening
the
skeptic
fastened
himself
to
me
he
insisted
on
my
walking
with
him
in
the
garden
so
she
comes
back
said
he
as
we
paced
down
the
path
quite
as
if
he
had
just
learned
of
the
prospect
of
her
return
i
can
hardly
wait
said
i
neither
can
i
he
agreed
solemnly
i
knew
i
should
miss
her
but
smoke
and
ashes
i
did
dream
the
week
would
be
a
period
of
time
long
enough
for
a
ray
of
light
to
travel
from
sirius
to
the
earth
and
back
again
if
she
could
only
hear
that
said
i
she
going
to
hear
it
he
declared
with
great
earnestness
kept
me
quiet
all
summer
but
by
a
man
impatience
she
ca
keep
me
quiet
any
longer
do
you
blame
me
he
inquired
wheeling
to
look
intently
at
me
through
the
september
twilight
not
a
bit
said
i
i
only
wished
she
could
stand
still
until
lad
grows
up
you
must
think
well
of
her
to
say
that
said
he
delightedly
and
on
my
word
i
do
know
but
she
will
continue
to
stand
still
as
far
as
looks
go
but
in
mind
and
heart
well
the
only
thing
is
i
so
far
below
her
i
do
dare
to
hope
all
i
know
is
that
for
sheer
womanly
sweetness
and
strength
there
nobody
her
equal
and
yet
when
i
try
to
put
my
finger
on
what
makes
her
what
she
is
i
ca
tell
one
ca
analyze
her
charm
said
i
except
as
you
just
done
it
womanly
sweetness
and
strength
hepatica
is
hepatica
and
being
that
we
love
her
we
do
said
he
half
under
his
breath
and
caught
my
hand
and
gave
it
a
grip
which
stung
the
next
morning
the
gay
lady
came
home
we
had
not
expected
her
until
evening
and
when
we
heard
a
light
footstep
approaching
through
the
hall
as
we
sat
at
breakfast
we
looked
at
one
another
in
dumb
astonishment
and
disbelief
but
the
next
instant
she
stood
smiling
at
us
from
the
doorway
she
was
glad
to
see
us
too
from
lad
ecstatic
embrace
she
came
into
mine
and
i
heard
her
eager
whisper
i
so
glad
to
get
back
to
the
skeptic
and
the
philosopher
wrung
her
hand
until
i
know
her
little
fingers
ached
and
they
stared
at
her
the
one
like
a
brother
the
other
like
well
she
must
have
seen
for
herself
no
they
were
not
rivals
the
philosopher
had
seen
the
skeptic
case
i
think
from
the
first
and
being
not
only
a
philosopher
but
a
man
and
the
skeptic
best
friend
had
never
allowed
himself
to
enter
the
race
at
all
i
had
detected
a
wistful
light
in
his
eyes
now
and
then
and
had
my
own
notion
of
what
might
have
happened
if
he
had
let
it
but
there
was
only
a
very
warm
brotherliness
in
the
greeting
he
gave
the
gay
lady
and
she
looked
back
into
his
eyes
too
frankly
for
me
to
think
he
had
ever
let
her
see
anything
else
she
sat
down
at
the
table
with
us
for
a
little
while
we
finished
and
you
should
have
seen
the
difference
in
the
look
of
the
room
it
was
another
place
she
ran
upstairs
to
her
own
room
and
i
followed
her
and
from
being
a
deserted
bedroom
with
a
lonely
aspect
it
became
a
human
habitation
with
an
atmosphere
of
home
she
took
off
her
travelling
dress
talking
gayly
to
me
all
the
while
and
brushed
her
bright
locks
and
put
on
one
of
the
charming
white
frocks
which
her
own
hands
had
made
and
then
came
and
held
me
tight
and
laughed
and
was
very
near
crying
and
said
there
was
never
such
another
place
as
this
there
certainly
never
is
when
you
are
in
it
dear
i
agreed
and
received
such
a
reward
for
that
as
only
the
gay
lady
knows
how
to
give
all
day
she
stayed
by
me
wherever
i
might
be
the
skeptic
watched
and
waited
he
got
not
the
ghost
of
an
opportunity
when
i
was
upon
the
porch
with
the
others
she
was
there
and
not
a
minute
after
when
evening
fell
it
found
the
gay
lady
on
a
cushion
close
by
my
knee
presently
the
philosopher
went
off
with
the
lad
down
to
the
river
the
skeptic
accompanied
them
part
of
the
distance
then
returned
quite
unexpectedly
by
way
of
the
shrubbery
and
swung
up
over
the
porch
rail
at
the
end
at
a
moment
when
the
gay
lady
feeling
safe
in
his
absence
had
gone
to
that
end
to
see
the
moonlight
upon
the
river
fair
in
love
and
war
exulted
the
skeptic
somewhat
breathlessly
it
seemed
to
be
a
favourite
maxim
with
him
i
recalled
his
having
excused
himself
for
eluding
dahlia
by
that
same
proverb
no
do
run
have
i
become
suddenly
so
terrifying
why
should
you
be
terrifying
asked
hepatica
come
and
sit
down
and
tell
us
what
you
all
been
doing
while
i
was
away
her
back
was
toward
me
there
was
a
long
window
open
close
beside
me
my
sympathy
was
with
the
skeptic
i
slipped
through
it
an
hour
later
i
went
out
upon
the
porch
again
nobody
was
there
i
sat
down
alone
feeling
half
excited
and
half
depressed
and
wholly
anxious
to
know
the
outcome
of
the
skeptic
tactics
i
waited
a
long
time
as
it
seemed
to
me
then
without
warning
a
voice
spoke
i
could
hardly
recognize
it
for
the
skeptic
voice
it
was
strung
so
tense
with
joy
do
shoot
it
said
we
come
down
i
looked
toward
the
end
of
the
porch
where
the
vines
cast
a
deep
shadow
i
could
not
see
them
but
they
must
have
been
there
all
the
time
and
the
shadow
cast
by
the
vines
was
not
a
wide
shadow
at
all
part
ii
i
dahlia
and
the
professor
amen
stuck
in
my
throat
the
skeptic
and
his
wife
hepatica
being
happily
established
in
a
beautifully
spacious
flat
in
town
measuring
thirty
feet
by
forty
over
all
invited
me
to
visit
them
as
both
had
spent
considerable
time
at
my
country
home
in
summer
they
insisted
that
it
was
only
just
for
me
to
allow
them
that
second
winter
after
their
marriage
to
return
my
hospitality
this
argument
alone
would
hardly
have
sufficed
for
winter
in
the
country
connected
by
trolley
with
the
town
is
hardly
less
delightful
to
me
than
summer
itself
but
there
were
other
and
convincing
arguments
and
they
ended
by
bringing
me
to
the
city
for
a
month
visit
in
the
heart
of
the
season
on
the
first
morning
at
breakfast
i
had
arrived
late
the
night
before
there
was
much
to
talk
about
it
a
curious
fact
said
the
skeptic
stirring
a
cup
of
coffee
with
which
his
wife
had
just
presented
him
as
hepatica
and
i
discovered
only
the
other
day
that
three
of
those
girls
who
visited
you
that
summer
four
years
ago
when
she
and
i
were
avoiding
each
other
you
avoiding
i
interpolated
well
i
was
trying
to
avoid
being
avoided
by
her
he
explained
three
of
those
girls
are
married
and
living
in
town
yes
i
know
said
i
at
least
i
know
camellia
and
althea
are
who
else
azalea
lives
across
the
river
does
she
yes
you
have
heard
of
the
latest
matrimonial
alliance
then
the
skeptic
chuckled
hepatica
looked
at
him
and
he
looked
at
her
and
then
they
both
looked
at
me
dahlia
was
married
yesterday
the
skeptic
announced
with
relish
in
a
manse
study
with
two
witnesses
i
was
astounded
i
had
just
come
from
home
and
dahlia
was
my
next
neighbour
she
had
been
away
more
or
less
all
winter
but
there
had
been
no
announcement
of
any
engagement
nor
sign
of
one
the
skeptic
enjoying
my
stupefaction
proceeded
to
give
what
he
considered
an
explanation
i
do
see
why
you
should
be
so
surprised
he
said
you
knew
dahlia
methods
her
net
was
always
spread
and
though
a
certain
wise
man
declares
it
in
vain
to
spread
it
in
the
sight
of
any
bird
humans
are
not
always
so
wary
a
man
who
chanced
to
be
walking
along
with
his
head
in
the
clouds
might
get
his
feet
entangled
in
a
cunningly
laid
net
and
so
it
happened
to
the
professor
the
professor
i
ejaculated
not
our
professor
the
skeptic
nodded
solemnly
he
was
our
professor
he
amended
he
hers
now
and
day
before
yesterday
he
was
free
he
glanced
at
his
watch
folded
his
napkin
in
haste
seized
his
coat
and
hat
kissed
his
wife
patted
her
shoulder
nodded
at
me
and
was
gone
a
minute
later
we
heard
the
whirr
and
slide
of
his
car
and
hepatica
at
the
window
was
returning
his
wave
he
looking
extremely
well
i
observed
he
must
be
twenty
pounds
heavier
than
he
was
that
summer
avoiding
being
avoided
was
probably
rather
thinning
he
does
seem
to
enjoy
his
food
admitted
hepatica
regarding
the
skeptic
empty
plate
with
satisfaction
not
much
doubt
of
that
i
agreed
remembering
the
delicately
hearty
breakfast
we
had
just
consumed
it
really
quite
dreadful
about
dahlia
and
the
poor
professor
it
said
hepatica
presently
and
it
just
as
don
says
he
was
literally
caught
in
her
net
i
presume
he
could
tell
precisely
how
it
happened
i
no
doubt
she
could
said
i
ungenerously
i
shall
be
anxious
to
see
them
oh
you
see
them
it
in
the
middle
of
term
he
could
take
her
away
and
his
old
quarters
are
just
two
blocks
below
us
she
knew
you
were
coming
you
probably
see
them
within
hours
we
did
though
not
where
we
could
do
more
than
take
observations
upon
them
the
philosopher
came
in
that
evening
he
had
known
of
my
coming
from
the
moment
that
hepatica
had
planned
to
ask
me
he
was
looking
rather
less
than
the
skeptic
but
quite
as
philosophical
and
altogether
as
friendly
as
ever
he
looked
hard
at
me
and
wrung
my
hand
and
immediately
began
to
lay
out
a
programme
for
my
visit
as
a
beginning
he
had
procured
tickets
for
the
philharmonic
society
concert
to
be
given
on
the
following
evening
we
told
him
about
dahlia
he
had
not
heard
he
looked
quickly
and
dumbfoundedly
at
the
skeptic
and
the
skeptic
grinned
back
at
him
you
feel
for
him
do
you
philo
he
queried
the
philosopher
shook
his
head
and
seemed
for
a
time
much
depressed
upon
which
the
skeptic
rallied
him
you
ought
to
be
jubilant
to
think
it
not
yourself
he
urged
his
friend
you
know
there
was
one
time
when
you
feared
even
to
go
home
with
her
though
you
were
to
be
within
call
from
the
porch
all
the
way
but
the
philosopher
cheered
up
presently
in
the
pleasure
of
talking
over
old
times
at
the
farm
he
had
spent
the
past
summer
tramping
through
germany
and
he
and
i
had
not
met
for
many
months
we
went
to
the
concert
next
evening
we
four
in
a
jovial
mood
there
was
considerable
sly
joking
on
the
skeptic
part
concerning
the
change
of
conditions
which
now
made
hepatica
my
chaperon
instead
of
as
in
former
days
my
being
alert
to
protect
her
from
visiting
philosophers
and
skeptics
the
philosopher
and
i
took
it
quite
in
good
part
for
nothing
could
be
more
settled
than
the
unimpassioned
character
of
our
old
friendship
as
there
could
be
nothing
more
satisfactory
we
had
not
more
than
taken
our
seats
when
the
skeptic
leaned
past
hepatica
to
call
my
attention
to
two
people
who
had
come
down
the
aisle
and
were
finding
their
places
just
across
it
and
in
the
row
ahead
of
us
i
turned
to
the
philosopher
there
they
are
i
whispered
so
our
four
pairs
of
eyes
gazed
interestedly
that
way
as
she
settled
into
place
dahlia
whose
pretty
flushed
face
had
been
turned
in
every
direction
over
the
house
as
she
got
out
of
her
evening
coat
caught
sight
of
us
she
bowed
and
smiled
with
great
cordiality
and
immediately
called
her
companion
attention
to
us
the
professor
eighteen
years
dahlia
senior
but
one
of
the
best
men
who
ever
walked
the
earth
as
we
had
long
since
discovered
turned
and
scanned
us
over
his
spectacles
then
he
also
responded
to
our
smiling
recognitions
with
a
somewhat
subdued
but
pleased
acknowledgment
dahlia
continued
to
whisper
to
him
still
glancing
back
at
us
from
time
to
time
with
looks
of
and
he
appeared
to
lend
an
attentive
ear
though
he
did
not
again
turn
toward
us
as
for
us
in
the
interest
of
our
observation
of
the
bridal
pair
we
fell
rather
silent
i
was
conscious
that
the
philosopher
regarding
them
somewhat
steadily
drew
a
deep
breath
which
sounded
like
a
sigh
of
dissatisfaction
noting
how
thin
the
professor
hair
seemed
to
be
over
the
crown
of
his
head
in
comparison
with
luxuriant
and
elaborately
dressed
chestnut
locks
i
felt
depressedly
that
the
disparity
in
age
was
more
marked
than
is
often
seen
this
in
itself
of
course
was
nothing
but
taken
in
connection
with
the
skeptic
leaned
forward
again
what
you
wager
i
could
get
up
a
flirtation
with
her
if
i
happened
to
sit
next
her
he
challenged
in
a
whisper
don
murmured
hepatica
but
she
smiled
i
not
anywhere
near
his
age
continued
the
skeptic
my
auburn
tresses
are
thick
upon
my
head
my
evening
clothes
were
made
a
decade
later
than
his
if
i
were
only
sitting
next
her
at
this
moment
some
more
people
came
down
the
aisle
and
were
shown
to
the
seats
immediately
beyond
our
friends
as
the
professor
and
dahlia
stood
up
to
let
them
through
we
saw
that
though
the
newcomers
passed
the
professor
without
recognition
the
young
man
exchanged
greetings
with
dahlia
as
they
took
their
seats
the
man
a
floridly
handsome
person
was
at
dahlia
elbow
for
the
third
time
the
skeptic
leaned
forward
it
just
as
well
perhaps
he
whispered
that
my
observations
are
to
be
made
upon
a
proxy
what
do
you
think
the
new
chap
chances
are
for
fun
on
both
sides
of
him
i
did
not
condescend
to
answer
and
without
further
delay
the
famous
conductor
of
a
famous
orchestra
came
commandingly
to
the
front
of
the
stage
welcomed
by
an
outburst
of
applause
and
with
the
rest
of
the
audience
we
became
silent
but
amidst
all
the
delights
of
the
ear
which
were
ours
that
evening
the
eyes
of
all
of
us
would
wander
from
time
to
time
across
the
aisle
the
professor
sat
with
arms
folded
and
head
bent
drinking
in
the
beauties
of
sound
which
beat
against
his
welcoming
ears
next
him
dahlia
the
bride
of
three
days
was
vindicating
the
skeptic
opinion
of
her
undiminished
accomplishments
the
young
man
upon
her
right
proved
an
able
second
the
girl
on
his
other
side
by
the
time
the
concert
was
half
over
was
holding
her
head
high
or
bending
it
to
study
a
programme
which
i
am
sure
she
did
not
see
while
her
companion
played
dahlia
old
game
with
a
trained
hand
can
the
ethiopian
change
his
skin
breathed
the
philosopher
in
my
ear
during
an
intermission
i
afraid
not
i
assented
dubiously
but
of
course
she
may
make
a
devoted
wife
nevertheless
that
sort
of
thing
does
mean
anything
to
her
you
know
she
merely
does
it
as
a
matter
of
habit
it
ca
be
precisely
an
endearing
habit
to
a
husband
protested
the
philosopher
if
she
would
address
a
remark
now
and
then
to
the
poor
man
at
her
left
one
might
excuse
her
and
if
she
could
carry
on
a
conversation
with
the
other
one
in
an
ordinarily
friendly
way
and
confine
it
to
the
intervals
between
numbers
one
might
be
able
to
forget
her
which
would
be
a
relief
but
all
those
silly
tricks
of
hers
those
smiles
those
archings
of
the
neck
those
lengthy
looks
up
into
the
eyes
of
that
fool
do
look
at
them
i
advised
i
ca
help
looking
at
them
everybody
else
is
looking
at
them
including
yourself
it
was
quite
true
everybody
was
even
people
considerably
out
of
range
if
dahlia
herself
was
conscious
of
this
and
i
sure
she
must
have
been
she
probably
ascribed
it
to
the
charm
of
her
appearance
she
is
even
prettier
than
she
used
to
be
but
as
we
were
wont
to
say
of
her
when
we
had
owned
to
all
her
attractiveness
if
only
after
all
urged
hepatica
on
the
homeward
way
we
no
right
to
judge
by
seeing
them
under
those
conditions
wait
till
we
had
them
alone
with
us
dahlia
told
me
on
the
way
out
that
they
were
planning
to
come
and
see
us
very
i
suggested
night
so
they
will
come
then
i
be
there
accepted
the
philosopher
quite
before
he
was
asked
so
on
the
following
evening
we
saw
them
alone
with
ourselves
the
dear
professor
seemed
to
us
more
than
before
the
pitiable
victim
of
a
woman
in
every
way
unsuited
to
him
yet
he
looked
at
dahlia
as
if
he
cared
for
her
very
much
and
was
only
a
trifle
bewildered
by
her
manner
with
other
men
what
dear
times
we
used
to
have
on
the
river
said
dahlia
to
the
philosopher
at
a
moment
when
nobody
else
happened
to
be
speaking
she
accompanied
this
observation
by
a
glance
it
was
dahlia
glances
which
gave
life
to
her
remarks
i
have
fished
in
that
river
for
three
summers
replied
the
philosopher
in
his
most
unsentimental
tone
you
used
to
have
better
luck
when
you
went
alone
said
dahlia
do
you
remember
how
we
could
never
stop
talking
long
enough
to
lure
any
fish
our
way
nevertheless
there
has
been
considerable
fishing
done
on
that
river
first
and
last
asserted
the
skeptic
with
a
twinkle
at
the
philosopher
who
looked
uncomfortable
the
professor
gentle
gaze
was
fixed
upon
each
speaker
in
turn
and
as
he
now
waited
upon
the
philosopher
reply
i
saw
the
latter
person
frown
slightly
i
never
considered
the
fishing
on
that
river
very
good
said
he
oh
it
did
need
to
be
cried
dahlia
i
can
shut
my
eyes
now
and
see
the
water
rippling
in
the
moonlight
ca
you
she
appealed
to
the
skeptic
i
ca
said
the
skeptic
i
never
noticed
how
it
rippled
in
the
moonlight
the
big
porch
is
my
favourite
haunt
at
the
farm
the
smoking
is
good
there
keeps
away
the
midges
midges
dahlia
gave
a
little
shriek
there
are
any
midges
in
that
part
of
the
country
there
are
some
kinds
of
little
annoying
insects
that
come
around
in
the
evening
then
persisted
the
skeptic
just
when
people
want
to
settle
down
and
have
themselves
to
themselves
the
philosopher
was
always
more
annoyed
by
them
than
i
he
has
a
sensitive
skin
once
started
on
this
sort
of
allusive
nonsense
it
was
difficult
for
us
to
head
off
the
skeptic
but
presently
noting
the
professor
kindly
face
assuming
a
puzzled
expression
as
he
watched
his
wife
kittenish
demeanour
the
skeptic
desisted
it
did
not
seem
necessary
for
him
to
demonstrate
to
us
that
quite
as
of
old
he
could
attract
dahlia
to
his
side
and
keep
her
there
before
the
evening
was
over
he
found
himself
occupied
also
quite
as
of
old
with
keeping
out
of
her
way
altogether
it
was
certainly
not
dahlia
fault
if
the
professor
did
not
gain
the
impression
that
both
the
skeptic
and
the
philosopher
were
rejected
suitors
of
her
own
when
they
had
gone
and
the
door
had
closed
upon
the
last
of
the
backward
looks
at
our
two
men
the
skeptic
dropped
into
a
chair
hepatica
will
you
kindly
mix
a
few
drops
of
soothing
syrup
for
me
he
requested
but
the
philosopher
fell
to
marching
up
and
down
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
a
deeper
gloom
on
his
brow
than
we
had
ever
seen
there
although
a
decade
the
philosopher
elder
the
professor
had
long
shared
bachelor
quarters
with
him
in
past
days
it
had
been
only
within
a
year
or
two
that
the
necessities
of
their
occupations
had
caused
them
to
separate
why
did
i
ever
let
him
go
off
by
himself
the
philosopher
muttered
remorsefully
why
did
i
keep
an
eye
on
him
it
would
have
made
no
difference
the
skeptic
offered
dismally
as
consolation
the
gods
would
destroy
they
first
make
mad
you
could
have
prevented
his
madness
i
could
have
seen
to
it
that
such
deadly
instruments
as
marriage
licences
and
irresponsible
clergymen
were
kept
out
of
his
way
groaned
the
philosopher
come
cheer
up
cried
hepatica
making
haste
to
light
the
under
her
i
going
to
brew
you
all
a
cup
of
comfort
with
lemons
and
sugar
and
things
look
at
her
commanded
the
skeptic
rallying
and
tell
me
if
marriage
is
a
failure
the
philosopher
paused
you
know
well
enough
what
i
think
of
your
marriage
he
owned
ii
camellia
and
the
judge
i
am
ashamed
that
women
are
so
simple
to
offer
war
when
they
should
kneel
for
peace
of
the
we
are
invited
to
spend
the
with
camellia
announced
my
hostess
at
the
one
morning
glancing
up
from
a
note
which
the
had
just
brought
to
the
door
the
skeptic
jumped
in
his
chair
those
same
old
sensations
come
over
me
he
announced
digging
away
vengefully
at
his
grapefruit
what
have
i
to
wear
my
only
consolation
now
is
that
camellia
married
a
man
who
cares
about
as
much
what
he
wears
as
i
do
it
not
camellia
clothes
that
bother
me
now
said
hepatica
thoughtfully
so
much
as
the
formality
of
her
style
of
entertaining
my
dear
she
has
a
butler
how
horrible
i
agreed
can
i
hope
to
please
the
eye
of
the
butler
camellia
husband
is
a
downright
good
fellow
said
the
skeptic
warmly
the
fuss
and
feathers
of
his
wife
hospitality
prevent
his
giving
you
the
real
thing
even
philo
likes
to
go
there
particularly
when
camellia
is
away
i
presume
invited
now
so
she
says
assented
hepatica
studying
her
note
again
with
a
care
not
to
look
at
me
which
made
me
quite
as
as
if
she
had
why
the
dear
people
will
all
persist
in
thinking
things
which
do
not
exist
of
course
i
was
glad
the
philosopher
was
to
be
there
what
enjoyment
is
not
the
keener
for
his
friendly
sharing
of
it
but
what
of
that
has
it
not
been
so
for
many
years
and
will
be
so
i
trust
for
all
to
come
hepatica
and
i
packed
with
care
selecting
the
most
expensive
things
we
owned
hepatica
scrutinized
the
skeptic
linen
critically
before
she
put
it
in
when
we
departed
we
were
as
correctly
attired
as
time
and
thought
could
make
us
when
we
arrived
we
were
doubly
glad
that
this
was
so
for
the
sight
of
the
butler
admitting
us
gave
us
much
the
same
feeling
of
being
badly
dressed
that
camellia
own
presence
had
been
wont
to
do
camellia
herself
was
as
exquisitely
arrayed
as
ever
but
she
looked
considerably
older
than
i
had
expected
i
wondered
if
constant
engagements
with
her
tailor
and
dressmaker
to
say
nothing
of
incessant
interviews
with
those
who
see
to
the
mechanism
of
formal
entertaining
had
not
begun
to
wear
upon
her
but
she
was
very
cordial
with
us
and
her
husband
the
judge
was
equally
so
he
was
considerably
her
senior
quite
as
much
so
i
decided
as
the
professor
was
dahlia
but
on
account
of
camellia
air
the
contrast
was
not
so
pronounced
we
sat
through
an
elaborate
dinner
during
which
i
suffered
more
or
less
strain
of
anxiety
concerning
my
forks
but
the
judge
at
whose
right
hand
i
sat
diverted
me
so
successfully
by
means
of
his
own
most
interesting
personality
and
delightful
powers
of
conversation
that
in
time
i
forgot
both
forks
and
butler
and
was
only
conscious
of
the
length
of
the
dinner
by
the
sense
toward
its
close
of
having
had
more
to
eat
than
i
wanted
illustration
camellia
herself
was
as
exquisitely
arrayed
as
ever
they
have
this
sort
of
thing
every
night
of
their
unfortunate
lives
to
a
greater
or
less
degree
murmured
the
skeptic
in
my
ear
as
the
men
came
into
the
impressively
decorated
room
where
camellia
and
hepatica
and
i
were
talking
over
common
memories
the
gladdest
man
to
get
into
his
summer
camp
in
maine
is
the
judge
and
the
life
of
absolute
abandon
to
freedom
he
lives
there
ought
to
teach
his
wife
a
thing
or
two
if
she
were
wise
enough
to
heed
it
why
two
people
but
i
just
eaten
their
salt
he
acknowledged
in
reply
to
what
i
suppose
must
have
been
my
accusing
look
and
forbore
to
say
more
i
think
i
give
a
little
dinner
for
you
night
said
camellia
reflectively
as
we
sat
about
a
very
informal
one
of
course
just
some
of
our
neighbours
i
felt
my
spirits
drop
i
saw
those
of
hepatica
and
the
skeptic
and
the
philosopher
drop
although
they
made
haste
to
prop
their
countenances
up
again
but
the
judge
protested
why
give
anything
my
dear
he
questioned
i
doubt
if
our
friends
would
prefer
meeting
our
neighbours
whom
they
do
know
to
visiting
with
ourselves
whom
they
do
however
egotistic
that
may
sound
i
want
to
make
things
gay
for
you
explained
camellia
and
the
latimers
and
the
elliots
are
very
gay
the
judge
only
lifted
his
handsome
and
the
liscombes
are
lovely
went
on
camellia
liscombe
sings
the
judge
ran
his
hand
through
the
thick
slightly
graying
locks
above
his
broad
forehead
he
did
not
need
to
tell
us
that
he
did
not
enjoy
hearing
liscombe
sing
and
doubted
if
we
should
harry
hodgson
recites
we
always
have
him
when
we
want
to
make
things
go
oh
he
not
a
professional
of
course
he
only
gives
readings
among
his
special
friends
i
believe
i
run
and
telephone
him
now
he
so
likely
to
have
engagements
camellia
hastened
away
we
could
hardly
tell
the
judge
we
fully
agreed
with
his
feeling
about
proposed
festivities
neither
could
we
discuss
his
tastes
with
him
he
and
we
talked
of
other
things
until
camellia
came
back
having
made
her
engagement
with
harry
hodgson
and
so
having
sealed
our
fate
for
the
succeeding
evening
the
skeptic
and
the
philosopher
spent
much
of
the
following
day
it
was
a
legal
holiday
with
the
judge
in
his
private
den
up
on
the
third
floor
this
as
camellia
showed
us
once
when
the
men
were
away
was
a
big
bare
room
this
was
her
characterization
principally
fireplace
books
and
windows
i
liked
it
better
than
any
other
place
in
the
house
for
it
was
unencumbered
with
useless
furniture
of
any
sort
and
the
view
from
its
windows
was
much
finer
than
that
from
below
stairs
but
we
not
invited
up
here
you
observe
was
camellia
comment
i
do
come
into
it
once
a
month
the
judge
spends
his
evenings
here
when
i
do
actually
force
him
to
go
out
with
me
and
i
spend
mine
down
in
the
pleasanter
quarters
i
have
the
liscombes
and
the
latimers
in
very
often
but
he
never
comes
down
if
he
can
avoid
it
they
understand
he
eccentric
and
we
let
it
go
at
that
she
spoke
with
the
air
of
being
a
most
kindly
and
forbearing
wife
i
followed
her
downstairs
pondering
over
points
of
view
eccentric
because
he
preferred
wide
fires
and
and
outlook
to
camellia
crowded
and
rooms
below
and
his
books
to
liscombe
music
and
harry
hodgson
readings
i
felt
that
i
knew
liscombe
and
hodgson
and
the
rest
quite
without
having
seen
them
i
found
the
next
evening
that
my
imagination
had
not
gone
far
astray
camellia
friends
were
certainly
quite
as
gay
as
she
had
pictured
them
and
gorgeously
dressed
i
felt
as
i
attempted
to
maintain
my
part
among
them
like
a
country
mouse
suddenly
precipitated
into
the
society
of
a
company
of
squirrels
liscombe
sang
for
us
i
could
not
make
out
what
it
was
she
sang
being
unfamiliar
with
the
music
and
unable
to
understand
the
words
she
possessed
a
voice
of
some
beauty
but
was
evidently
determined
to
be
classed
among
the
sopranos
who
are
able
to
soar
highest
and
when
she
took
certain
notes
i
experienced
a
peculiar
and
most
disagreeable
sensation
in
the
back
of
my
neck
i
wonder
if
we
could
bring
in
a
stepladder
for
her
murmured
the
skeptic
in
my
ear
it
gives
me
a
pang
to
see
a
woman
alone
and
unassisted
attempt
to
reach
something
several
feet
above
her
head
hodgson
recited
for
us
with
great
fervour
he
fought
a
battle
on
the
floor
fought
and
bled
and
died
all
in
a
harrowing
tenor
voice
he
was
slender
and
pale
and
it
seemed
a
pity
that
he
should
have
to
suffer
so
much
with
so
many
stalwart
men
at
hand
from
the
first
moment
when
he
drew
his
sword
and
leaped
into
the
fray
our
sympathies
were
with
him
although
he
personified
a
doughty
man
of
battles
and
led
ten
thousand
lusty
followers
there
were
moments
when
one
could
not
quite
forget
the
swinging
of
his
evening
attire
but
on
the
whole
he
was
an
interesting
study
and
i
was
much
diverted
dear
little
fellow
it
was
the
skeptic
again
how
came
they
to
let
him
go
to
war
and
he
so
young
and
tender
i
exchanged
observations
with
hodgson
after
his
final
reading
i
can
hardly
say
that
i
conversed
with
him
for
our
patchwork
interview
could
not
deserve
that
name
at
the
same
time
i
noted
with
interest
the
philosopher
expression
as
he
and
liscombe
turned
over
a
pile
of
music
if
i
had
not
known
him
so
well
i
should
have
been
deceived
by
that
grave
and
interested
air
of
his
a
slight
frown
of
concentrated
attention
between
his
eyebrows
into
thinking
him
deeply
impressed
by
the
lady
dicta
and
by
her
somewhat
dashing
manner
as
she
delivered
them
but
familiar
of
old
with
the
quizzical
expression
which
at
times
could
be
discovered
to
underlie
the
exterior
of
charmed
absorption
i
understood
that
the
philosopher
was
quietly
and
skilfully
classifying
a
new
if
not
a
rare
specimen
when
the
guests
had
lingeringly
departed
i
saw
as
i
went
to
my
room
three
male
forms
leaping
up
the
second
flight
of
stairs
toward
the
judge
den
do
you
envy
them
the
chance
to
soothe
their
nerves
with
a
pipe
beside
the
fire
up
there
i
asked
hepatica
as
with
hair
down
and
trailing
loose
garments
she
came
into
my
room
through
the
door
which
we
had
discovered
could
be
opened
between
our
quarters
indeed
i
do
they
went
up
those
stairs
like
three
dogs
loosed
from
the
leash
did
they
can
one
blame
them
one
can
not
hepatica
gazed
at
me
i
stared
back
but
we
were
under
our
host
roof
liscombe
really
has
quite
a
voice
said
hepatica
examining
the
details
of
the
tiny
travelling
workbag
i
always
carry
with
me
so
she
has
it
was
a
wonderful
dinner
was
it
it
was
indeed
would
you
mind
having
quite
specially
simple
things
to
eat
for
a
day
or
two
after
we
go
back
i
been
planning
them
admitted
hepatica
hodgson
readings
were
entirely
new
to
me
were
they
to
you
i
had
never
heard
of
the
authors
few
people
can
have
heard
of
them
i
think
several
were
original
indeed
would
you
mind
taking
off
your
society
manner
requested
hepatica
a
trifle
fractiously
i
a
little
tired
of
seeing
you
wear
it
so
incessantly
i
shall
be
delighted
i
agreed
i
sprang
up
and
she
met
me
and
seizing
me
about
the
neck
buried
her
face
in
my
shoulder
i
felt
her
shaking
with
smothered
laughter
and
had
great
difficulty
in
keeping
my
own
emotions
under
control
we
went
home
on
sunday
afternoon
the
skeptic
pleading
the
necessity
of
his
being
up
at
an
early
hour
next
morning
by
unanimous
consent
we
went
to
the
evening
service
of
a
church
where
one
goes
to
hear
that
which
is
worth
hearing
and
invariably
hears
it
the
music
there
is
also
worth
a
long
journey
though
it
is
not
at
all
of
an
elaborate
sort
there
i
feel
better
after
that
declared
the
skeptic
heartily
as
we
came
out
it
seems
to
take
the
taste
of
last
evening
out
of
my
mouth
nobody
said
anything
directly
about
our
late
visit
until
we
had
reached
home
then
the
skeptic
fired
up
his
diminutive
gas
grate
which
is
much
better
than
none
at
all
and
turned
off
the
electrics
we
sat
before
the
cheery
little
glow
luxuriating
in
a
sense
of
relaxation
it
seems
ungracious
somehow
to
discuss
people
when
one
has
just
left
their
hospitality
suggested
hepatica
as
the
skeptic
showed
signs
of
letting
loose
the
dogs
of
war
not
between
ourselves
dear
affirmed
the
skeptic
we
four
constitute
a
private
court
of
inquiry
into
the
condition
of
our
friends
when
i
think
of
the
judge
he
has
his
own
way
after
all
when
it
comes
to
refusing
to
join
in
the
sort
of
thing
that
pleases
camellia
said
i
of
course
he
does
he
too
much
of
a
man
not
to
have
it
but
living
upstairs
while
my
wife
lives
downstairs
is
precisely
my
ideal
of
married
happiness
the
philosopher
shoved
his
hands
far
down
into
his
pockets
and
laid
his
head
back
gazing
up
at
the
ceiling
what
puzzles
me
he
mused
is
the
attraction
such
a
woman
has
at
the
start
for
such
a
man
camellia
was
a
most
attractive
girl
said
i
you
mean
her
clothes
were
most
attractive
amended
the
skeptic
they
even
befuddled
me
for
a
few
brief
hours
as
i
remember
till
i
discovered
that
not
all
is
gold
that
you
did
discover
that
yourself
the
philosopher
reminded
him
we
had
to
do
it
for
you
you
do
mind
our
recalling
his
temporary
paralysis
of
intellect
he
questioned
hepatica
suddenly
it
was
all
your
fault
anyhow
for
retiring
to
the
background
and
allowing
the
fireworks
to
have
full
play
hepatica
smiled
the
skeptic
put
out
his
hand
and
got
hold
of
hers
and
drew
it
over
to
his
knee
where
he
retained
it
she
knows
i
never
swerved
a
point
off
my
allegiance
to
her
he
declared
with
confidence
do
you
suppose
suggested
hepatica
if
the
judge
and
camellia
were
to
lose
all
their
money
and
had
to
come
down
to
living
in
a
little
home
like
this
it
would
help
things
any
the
skeptic
shook
his
head
the
philosopher
shook
his
thoughtfully
it
too
late
said
the
latter
her
ideals
are
a
fixed
quantity
now
to
be
reckoned
with
so
are
his
under
any
conditions
there
would
be
absolute
diversity
of
tastes
i
do
think
there
any
ideal
more
hopelessly
fixed
than
the
fine
clothes
ideal
the
skeptic
looked
at
his
wife
i
like
nice
clothes
said
she
smiling
at
him
so
you
do
he
rejoined
thank
heaven
a
woman
who
does
is
abnormal
but
when
we
walk
down
certain
streets
together
you
can
see
something
besides
the
i
look
away
so
i
wo
want
the
things
confessed
hepatica
the
skeptic
laughed
and
the
philosopher
and
i
joined
him
i
passed
hepatica
the
other
day
when
she
did
see
me
said
the
philosopher
to
me
she
was
staring
fixedly
in
at
a
i
stole
up
behind
her
to
see
what
held
such
an
attraction
for
it
often
lets
a
great
light
in
on
a
friend
character
if
you
can
see
the
particular
object
in
a
which
fixes
his
longing
attention
when
i
had
discovered
what
she
was
looking
at
i
stole
away
again
chuckling
to
myself
what
was
it
i
asked
i
wager
half
i
own
that
the
wife
of
our
friend
the
judge
have
given
that
window
a
second
glance
pursued
the
philosopher
it
was
probably
a
bargain
sale
of
paper
patterns
guessed
the
skeptic
but
we
knew
he
did
think
it
a
bargain
sale
of
groceries
more
likely
said
hepatica
herself
it
was
no
bargain
sale
of
anything
denied
the
philosopher
it
was
a
most
expensive
edition
of
the
works
of
charles
dickens
good
for
you
patty
cried
the
skeptic
iii
azalea
and
the
cashier
a
mother
is
a
mother
still
the
holiest
thing
alive
i
am
to
spend
the
day
with
azalea
i
announced
as
i
said
good
night
one
evening
and
i
shall
not
come
back
until
so
late
that
you
must
sit
up
for
me
azalea
could
ask
me
to
stay
all
night
on
account
of
using
the
for
a
nursery
during
the
winter
but
she
very
anxious
to
have
me
there
in
the
evening
for
it
the
only
chance
i
shall
have
to
see
her
husband
remain
late
enough
to
see
her
husband
by
all
means
urged
the
skeptic
i
want
to
hear
what
sort
of
man
had
the
courage
to
marry
a
musical
genius
who
could
wipe
only
one
teaspoon
at
a
time
azalea
was
a
lovely
girl
said
hepatica
warmly
it
could
take
much
courage
to
marry
her
all
right
we
hear
about
it
when
our
guest
comes
back
and
i
be
over
to
bring
you
home
if
you
telephone
about
an
hour
before
be
ready
to
start
thank
you
it
really
wo
be
necessary
for
you
to
come
i
replied
the
skeptic
eyed
me
narrowly
then
he
glanced
at
hepatica
and
grinned
good
night
said
i
again
and
walked
away
to
my
room
good
night
the
skeptic
called
after
me
but
do
hesitate
to
call
me
if
anything
should
detain
philo
i
arrived
at
azalea
home
early
next
morning
having
been
earnestly
asked
to
come
in
time
to
see
the
babies
take
their
bath
there
is
nothing
i
like
better
than
to
see
a
baby
take
a
bath
and
to
see
two
at
once
was
a
bribe
indeed
azalea
met
me
at
the
door
of
her
suburban
home
the
larger
of
her
two
children
the
on
her
arm
he
was
evidently
just
ready
for
his
bath
for
he
was
wrapped
in
a
blanket
and
one
pink
foot
stuck
temptingly
out
from
its
folds
azalea
greeted
me
with
enthusiasm
pushing
back
the
loose
curling
locks
from
her
forehead
as
she
did
so
explaining
that
bud
had
just
pulled
them
down
she
did
not
look
in
the
least
like
the
girl
who
had
sung
for
us
but
it
occurred
to
me
that
enveloped
in
the
big
flannel
she
was
even
more
engaging
than
she
had
been
upon
the
porch
at
the
farm
i
do
know
when
i
have
enjoyed
anything
so
much
as
i
enjoyed
seeing
azalea
give
that
bath
the
little
baby
was
asleep
in
her
crib
when
we
went
into
the
nursery
which
had
been
the
before
the
second
baby
came
so
azalea
gave
bud
his
splash
all
by
himself
he
was
plump
and
dimpled
and
jolly
and
he
cried
only
once
when
his
mother
inadvertently
rubbed
soap
in
his
eyes
while
talking
with
me
when
he
smiled
again
he
was
a
cherub
of
cherubs
but
he
had
waked
his
small
sister
and
azalea
gave
me
permission
to
take
her
up
while
she
finished
with
bud
she
was
six
months
old
and
she
was
afraid
of
me
only
for
a
minute
or
two
and
i
held
her
and
cuddled
her
and
wanted
to
take
her
away
with
me
so
fiercely
that
i
had
all
i
could
do
to
give
her
over
to
azalea
for
her
bath
boy
babies
are
delightful
but
girl
babies
are
heavenly
we
had
a
busy
day
made
up
of
babies
with
more
or
less
talk
between
which
did
matter
in
the
least
late
in
the
afternoon
azalea
put
everything
straight
in
the
rooms
more
or
less
upset
by
bud
during
the
day
and
dressed
herself
for
the
evening
she
dressed
both
children
also
making
them
fresh
as
rosebuds
i
saw
her
putting
flowers
on
the
table
in
the
lighting
a
special
at
a
table
in
the
corner
of
the
and
pulling
an
easy
chair
to
stand
close
beside
it
there
was
a
small
grand
piano
in
the
room
it
had
been
closed
all
day
for
bud
fingers
could
just
reach
the
keyboard
azalea
opened
it
you
have
had
time
said
i
but
i
looking
forward
to
hearing
you
sing
this
evening
it
my
husband
you
are
to
hear
sing
said
azalea
contentedly
he
has
a
splendid
voice
i
shall
be
delighted
i
agreed
but
surely
you
will
sing
too
my
voice
seems
to
wake
up
the
children
said
she
arthur
never
does
it
odd
for
his
voice
is
much
heavier
of
course
but
i
can
never
take
really
high
notes
without
hearing
a
wail
from
either
bud
or
dot
and
that
not
worth
while
wo
you
sing
now
then
i
begged
while
they
are
awake
i
really
ca
go
away
without
hearing
you
and
you
know
when
the
philosopher
comes
he
will
be
so
anxious
to
have
you
sing
the
babies
will
go
to
bed
before
dinner
she
insisted
so
i
very
well
sing
for
the
philosopher
but
i
sing
for
you
now
of
course
she
laid
little
dot
in
my
lap
but
dot
was
already
sleepy
and
protested
so
azalea
went
to
the
piano
with
dot
on
her
arm
bud
seeing
her
go
followed
and
stood
by
her
knee
on
her
trailing
skirts
i
do
know
how
she
managed
to
play
her
own
accompaniment
but
she
did
at
least
subdued
chords
enough
to
carry
the
harmony
of
the
song
there
were
no
notes
before
her
on
the
rack
and
she
looked
down
into
one
or
the
other
of
the
two
small
faces
as
she
sang
and
of
course
it
was
a
lullaby
which
fell
like
notes
of
pearl
and
silver
from
her
lips
when
she
finished
i
could
only
smile
at
her
through
an
obscuring
mist
never
in
all
the
times
i
had
heard
her
sing
had
she
reached
my
heart
like
this
but
somehow
the
picture
of
her
sitting
in
the
half
light
at
the
grand
piano
with
the
babies
in
her
arms
and
at
her
knee
singing
lullabies
and
leaving
the
fine
music
for
her
husband
to
sing
by
and
by
was
quite
irresistible
somehow
as
i
listened
i
was
troubled
by
no
doubts
lest
she
had
not
learned
deftly
to
wipe
ten
teaspoons
at
once
her
husband
came
home
presently
a
tall
thin
young
bank
cashier
with
a
face
i
liked
at
once
he
was
plainly
weary
but
his
eyes
lit
up
with
satisfaction
at
sight
of
the
three
who
met
him
at
the
door
and
the
welcome
his
young
son
gave
him
showed
that
bud
recognized
a
i
heard
the
pair
romping
upstairs
as
the
cashier
made
dressing
for
dinner
a
game
in
which
the
little
child
could
join
illustration
the
picture
of
her
sitting
in
the
half
light
at
the
grand
piano
with
the
babies
in
her
arms
and
at
her
knee
was
quite
irresistible
but
before
we
sat
down
to
dinner
both
babies
had
been
put
to
bed
the
cashier
remained
with
me
while
azalea
was
busy
at
this
task
but
he
excused
himself
toward
the
last
and
went
tiptoeing
upstairs
where
i
think
he
must
have
offered
his
services
in
getting
the
children
tucked
away
while
he
was
gone
the
philosopher
arrived
i
let
him
in
myself
motioning
the
maid
away
it
was
a
small
house
and
i
knew
she
was
needed
in
the
kitchen
do
make
a
bit
of
noise
i
cautioned
him
as
he
came
smiling
into
the
little
hall
the
babies
are
going
to
bed
babies
whispered
the
philosopher
in
an
awestruck
way
i
did
know
there
were
any
babies
of
course
you
knew
it
i
whispered
back
leading
him
into
the
room
if
you
would
only
store
away
really
important
facts
in
that
capacious
mind
of
yours
instead
of
limiting
it
to
tell
me
how
many
babies
and
of
what
sex
quick
commanded
the
philosopher
or
i
shall
say
the
wrong
thing
and
how
on
earth
do
they
come
to
know
enough
to
put
their
babies
to
bed
before
they
ask
a
bachelor
to
dine
anyhow
i
hastily
set
him
straight
upon
these
points
adding
that
azalea
had
developed
wonderfully
you
mean
she
can
soar
to
high
q
now
i
suppose
interpreted
the
philosopher
not
at
all
i
mean
that
she
but
they
were
coming
downstairs
together
the
cashier
arm
was
about
his
wife
shoulders
he
removed
it
only
just
in
time
to
save
his
dignity
as
he
entered
i
disappointed
not
to
see
the
boy
and
girl
declared
the
philosopher
genially
the
cashier
took
him
by
the
shoulders
and
turned
him
toward
the
light
laughing
that
was
bravely
said
he
answered
how
did
you
know
but
we
might
go
and
wake
them
up
for
you
to
see
the
dinner
was
quite
unpretentious
but
very
good
evidently
azalea
had
a
capable
servant
we
talked
gaily
the
cashier
proving
an
adept
at
keeping
the
ball
in
the
air
and
keenly
appreciative
of
others
attempts
to
meet
him
at
the
sport
by
and
by
when
we
were
back
in
the
room
where
the
grand
piano
stood
and
conversation
had
reached
a
momentary
halt
azalea
went
to
the
piano
come
arthur
she
said
sitting
down
at
it
and
patting
a
pile
of
music
i
want
our
friends
to
hear
toreador
the
cashier
looked
up
protestingly
you
are
the
one
they
want
to
hear
dear
he
declared
she
shook
her
head
they
heard
me
often
but
never
you
i
think
besides
it
wakes
the
babies
you
know
for
me
to
sing
you
do
need
to
sing
high
notes
azalea
i
urged
i
like
nothing
so
well
as
the
lullaby
you
sang
to
the
babies
but
she
shook
her
head
again
that
their
song
she
said
you
were
specially
privileged
to
hear
it
at
all
but
i
ca
do
it
for
company
come
arthur
please
so
the
cashier
sang
the
philosopher
and
i
found
it
necessary
to
avoid
each
other
eyes
as
he
did
it
the
cashier
could
roar
toreador
no
doubt
of
that
the
voice
of
the
bull
of
bashan
would
have
been
as
the
summer
wind
in
the
trees
beside
it
where
so
much
volume
came
from
we
could
not
tell
as
we
looked
at
the
thin
frame
of
the
performer
why
the
babies
did
not
wake
up
will
ever
remain
a
mystery
why
azalea
did
not
desert
her
accompaniment
to
press
her
hands
over
bursting
ear
drums
i
can
not
imagine
for
it
was
with
difficulty
that
i
surrendered
my
own
to
the
shock
but
azalea
played
on
to
the
end
and
looked
up
into
the
cashier
flushed
face
at
the
last
note
with
a
smile
of
proprietary
triumph
then
she
turned
about
to
us
that
fairly
takes
me
off
my
feet
cried
the
philosopher
i
groped
hurriedly
for
a
compliment
which
would
match
the
equivocal
fervour
of
this
but
i
could
not
equal
it
how
much
you
must
enjoy
singing
together
i
said
when
the
babies
are
awake
and
felt
annoyed
that
i
could
have
said
it
for
i
could
really
not
imagine
the
two
voices
together
azalea
glowed
the
cashier
grinned
he
is
as
as
he
is
you
a
clever
pair
he
chuckled
i
trained
him
myself
said
azalea
when
i
knew
him
first
never
thought
of
singing
i
only
discovered
his
voice
by
accident
it
needs
much
more
work
with
it
of
course
but
it
powerful
and
it
has
a
quality
that
will
improve
with
cultivation
the
cashier
patted
her
shoulders
now
you
sing
some
soft
little
thing
for
them
my
girl
he
commanded
and
looking
up
at
him
again
azalea
obeyed
she
chose
an
old
ballad
one
with
no
chance
in
it
to
show
the
range
of
her
voice
she
sang
it
exquisitely
and
the
cashier
stood
by
and
turned
her
music
as
if
he
considered
it
a
high
privilege
yet
through
the
little
dot
woke
up
azalea
broke
off
in
the
middle
of
a
bar
and
fled
up
the
stairs
the
truth
is
i
afraid
said
the
cashier
looking
after
her
with
an
expression
on
his
face
which
indicated
that
he
wanted
to
flee
too
nothing
really
counts
in
this
house
but
the
babies
they
and
something
else
suggested
the
philosopher
gently
the
cashier
looked
at
him
he
nodded
yes
and
something
else
he
agreed
with
his
bright
smile
we
came
away
rather
late
the
philosopher
looked
up
at
the
house
as
the
door
closed
upon
the
warm
farewells
which
had
sent
us
out
into
the
night
it
a
little
bit
of
a
house
is
it
he
commented
i
looked
up
too
at
the
nursery
windows
where
the
faintest
of
showed
yes
it
very
small
i
agreed
yet
quite
big
enough
although
it
holds
so
much
one
would
hardly
have
said
four
years
ago
that
anything
smaller
than
the
biggest
musical
auditorium
in
the
city
would
have
been
big
enough
to
hold
azalea
voice
he
mused
if
you
could
have
heard
her
sing
her
lullaby
to
those
babies
i
replied
as
we
walked
slowly
on
you
would
have
said
her
voice
would
be
wasted
on
a
concert
audience
it
seems
a
pleasant
home
it
one
somehow
one
distrusts
the
ability
of
musical
prodigies
to
make
pleasant
homes
i
wonder
why
should
the
knowledge
of
any
art
make
one
appreciative
of
other
arts
it
took
some
time
for
a
certain
exhibition
of
the
domestic
art
to
strike
in
at
your
home
that
summer
said
the
philosopher
but
i
believe
azalea
came
to
envy
our
hepatica
at
the
last
did
she
indeed
she
did
and
she
never
got
over
envying
her
her
accomplishments
she
asked
me
ever
so
many
questions
about
hepatica
housekeeping
i
wish
i
had
had
a
chance
before
i
went
to
tell
her
that
i
was
sure
her
will
to
succeed
would
make
her
home
as
dear
a
one
as
even
hepatica
could
be
one
thing
is
sure
as
long
as
she
lets
the
cashier
do
the
singing
in
the
limelight
while
she
looks
after
the
babies
there
be
no
occasion
for
their
friends
to
demand
more
music
of
an
evening
than
is
good
for
her
pride
of
spirit
chuckled
the
philosopher
what
are
we
at
our
station
already
i
say
let
not
make
a
quick
trip
by
train
let
make
a
slow
one
by
cab
by
cab
it
would
take
two
hours
no
no
here
comes
our
train
this
is
the
first
time
we
gone
anywhere
since
you
been
here
without
two
alert
chaperons
younger
than
myself
grumbled
the
philosopher
the
more
reason
then
that
we
should
give
them
no
anxiety
on
my
account
i
like
to
walk
the
whole
way
said
he
i
laughed
as
i
obeyed
the
signal
of
an
impatient
guard
and
rushed
upon
the
train
now
talk
to
me
said
i
as
we
took
our
seats
my
lungs
were
built
for
the
toreador
song
he
objected
iv
althea
and
the
promoter
what
an
interesting
fellow
our
host
is
he
is
almost
more
interesting
because
of
the
qualities
he
does
not
possess
than
because
of
the
qualities
that
he
does
possess
christopher
it
ever
so
quoted
the
skeptic
under
his
breath
to
me
no
place
hepatica
turned
and
gave
him
a
smiling
look
which
nevertheless
conveyed
warning
he
needed
it
the
skeptic
was
in
a
mad
and
merry
mood
and
no
glance
shot
at
him
which
being
interpreted
meant
that
we
were
under
our
hosts
roof
had
thus
far
been
of
avail
we
are
not
under
their
roof
he
argued
defiantly
in
reply
to
one
of
these
silent
remonstrances
this
is
their
roof
this
is
the
roof
of
the
hotel
amazon
that
a
very
different
thing
so
different
that
if
i
lived
under
it
i
but
the
promoter
was
approaching
us
again
with
the
news
that
dinner
had
just
been
announced
as
served
he
immediately
led
the
way
with
me
hepatica
followed
with
the
philosopher
and
althea
and
the
skeptic
brought
up
the
rear
it
was
on
the
great
staircase
that
the
skeptic
pausing
to
gaze
upward
at
a
command
from
the
promoter
who
had
just
bid
him
observe
certain
mural
decorations
done
by
the
distinguished
hand
of
some
man
of
whom
i
fear
none
of
us
had
ever
heard
murmured
the
words
concerning
the
humble
home
i
always
like
to
walk
down
this
staircase
when
i
not
in
a
hurry
i
had
heard
althea
saying
to
the
skeptic
behind
us
to
get
the
effect
from
the
landing
is
it
wonderful
we
all
paused
upon
the
landing
which
was
about
thirty
feet
square
the
skeptic
leaning
against
the
marble
balustrade
gazed
out
over
the
scene
with
an
air
of
prostrating
himself
before
a
shrine
awe
and
wonder
dominated
his
aspect
only
we
who
were
familiar
with
a
certain
curving
line
over
his
left
eyebrow
knew
that
he
was
longing
to
break
into
an
apostrophe
on
the
magnificence
before
him
which
would
have
alienated
althea
and
her
husband
forevermore
these
columns
are
of
the
purest
something
marble
declared
the
promoter
laying
his
hand
upon
one
of
them
he
rather
mumbled
the
name
and
i
think
none
of
us
were
able
to
recognize
it
indeed
said
the
skeptic
and
laid
his
hand
upon
the
column
it
seems
stout
it
the
same
that
is
used
in
the
royal
palace
at
athens
added
the
promoter
that
must
be
why
it
feels
so
to
the
touch
murmured
the
skeptic
but
luckily
nobody
heard
him
but
myself
in
due
course
of
time
proceeding
across
a
gorgeous
lobby
and
traversing
an
impressive
corridor
passing
lackeys
in
livery
and
guests
in
evening
finery
we
arrived
at
the
doorway
of
the
most
elaborately
ornate
dining
hall
i
had
ever
seen
the
promoter
paused
in
the
doorway
to
let
the
first
impression
sink
in
i
could
have
had
our
dinner
served
in
a
private
of
course
said
he
to
us
but
althea
and
i
decided
that
you
would
enjoy
this
better
there
nothing
like
it
anywhere
it
absolutely
cosmopolitan
people
from
all
over
the
world
are
dining
here
are
every
night
every
tenth
man
is
worth
his
millions
notice
the
third
table
on
the
right
as
we
go
by
that
joseph
chrysler
the
iron
magnate
with
his
party
is
a
french
actress
worshipped
on
both
sides
the
water
keep
your
eyes
peeled
a
bowing
potentate
motioned
us
forward
a
bending
waiter
put
us
in
our
places
orchids
decorated
our
table
an
extraordinarily
expensive
orchestra
celebrated
our
arrival
with
strains
from
a
popular
opera
then
raging
people
all
around
glanced
at
us
and
immediately
away
again
i
suppose
we
showed
by
our
appearance
that
we
were
the
possessors
neither
of
millions
nor
of
accomplishments
the
promoter
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
the
demeanour
of
a
large
and
puffy
young
frog
on
the
edge
of
a
pool
he
settled
his
white
waistcoat
and
looked
from
side
to
side
with
the
superior
glance
of
a
man
who
owns
the
whole
thing
althea
in
her
place
also
wore
a
air
of
being
hostess
to
a
party
which
must
appreciate
the
privilege
of
dining
under
such
auspices
our
table
was
a
circular
one
and
the
skeptic
sat
upon
my
right
the
promoter
at
my
left
occupied
himself
with
hepatica
much
of
the
time
hepatica
had
never
looked
lovelier
than
though
her
simple
white
evening
frock
was
not
cut
half
so
low
as
althea
pink
embroidered
one
nor
cost
half
so
much
as
my
plain
althea
devoted
herself
to
the
philosopher
she
and
the
skeptic
had
never
got
on
very
well
meanwhile
the
skeptic
was
saying
things
into
my
ear
under
cover
of
the
orchestra
and
the
loud
hum
of
talk
this
is
a
crowd
he
commented
this
certainly
is
a
crowd
men
of
millions
and
men
who
do
know
how
they
going
to
meet
the
next
note
due
but
bluffing
it
through
somebodies
and
nobodies
kingfish
and
minnows
and
some
of
the
kingfish
are
going
to
swallow
the
minnows
at
the
next
gulp
what
in
the
name
of
time
is
this
we
eating
now
i
expressed
my
ignorance
and
what
this
we
to
have
with
it
he
pursued
look
out
he
had
known
i
would
thank
him
for
the
warning
i
shielded
my
glass
from
an
imminent
bottle
it
was
the
third
time
already
and
the
dinner
was
not
far
on
its
way
i
saw
hepatica
shield
hers
also
for
the
third
time
a
tiny
flush
was
beginning
to
creep
up
althea
cheeks
she
had
refused
only
the
first
offering
of
the
waiter
the
promoter
turned
and
viewed
my
empty
glasses
with
contempt
we
have
to
get
you
to
stay
in
town
long
enough
to
overcome
those
notions
of
yours
said
he
look
around
you
i
wager
not
another
in
the
room
if
i
flushed
it
was
not
for
either
of
the
reasons
which
caused
the
brilliant
cheeks
i
saw
all
about
me
i
think
you
are
quite
right
said
i
as
i
looked
i
saw
a
garrulous
lady
at
the
table
on
my
right
whose
high
laughter
was
beginning
to
carry
far
i
observed
a
sleepy
one
at
my
left
who
had
spilled
champagne
down
the
front
of
her
elaborate
corsage
and
was
nodding
over
her
ices
i
glanced
at
hepatica
her
pretty
head
was
held
high
her
eyes
too
sparkled
but
not
with
wine
the
promoter
began
to
talk
of
investments
telling
stories
of
great
made
by
men
who
had
the
daring
not
necessary
for
them
to
have
the
money
i
suppose
queried
the
philosopher
not
at
all
agreed
the
promoter
life
a
game
of
poker
if
not
afraid
to
sit
in
and
have
the
nerve
to
bluff
it
through
you
can
win
out
with
a
hand
that
would
make
a
quitter
commit
suicide
althea
listened
with
pride
to
her
husband
discourse
he
a
man
of
the
world
one
could
see
she
was
thinking
who
is
making
the
eyes
drop
out
of
the
heads
of
these
simple
people
i
so
impressed
said
the
skeptic
to
me
that
i
can
hardly
eat
think
of
living
in
a
place
like
this
having
this
every
day
common
like
the
dust
under
your
feet
can
i
ever
eat
creamed
codfish
and
again
think
you
hepatica
must
name
the
hash
by
a
french
name
and
serve
me
grape
juice
with
it
or
i
ca
condescend
to
eat
it
i
say
the
smoke
is
getting
a
bit
thick
here
for
you
ladies
is
it
we
had
been
late
in
coming
down
and
at
many
tables
people
were
nearing
the
end
of
the
dinner
for
some
time
the
odour
of
expensive
cigars
had
been
growing
heavier
throughout
the
room
a
blue
haze
hung
over
the
more
distant
tables
i
do
think
my
lungs
mind
it
so
much
as
my
feelings
i
answered
i
shall
never
be
able
to
make
it
seem
to
me
just
just
try
to
subdue
the
expression
which
dominates
your
countenance
at
the
present
moment
counselled
the
skeptic
gently
or
you
will
be
quietly
led
away
from
the
scene
as
dangerous
to
your
after
what
seemed
like
many
hours
we
reached
the
end
of
the
dinner
i
felt
that
i
should
be
glad
to
reach
the
quiet
and
comparative
purity
of
air
to
be
found
in
the
room
in
which
our
hosts
had
received
us
a
private
but
this
was
not
to
be
we
were
taken
from
place
to
place
about
the
hotel
to
look
in
on
this
or
that
scene
of
entertainment
of
banqueting
of
revelry
gorgeousness
upon
gorgeousness
was
revealed
to
us
althea
now
very
gay
and
sparkling
in
manner
her
carefully
dressed
hair
a
little
loosened
her
mind
full
of
schemes
for
our
diversion
took
the
lead
showing
off
everything
with
that
air
of
personal
possession
i
have
often
observed
in
the
frequenters
of
hostelries
like
the
amazon
hepatica
in
spite
of
evident
effort
to
maintain
her
part
grew
a
trifle
silent
as
i
regarded
her
i
was
reminded
of
a
white
dove
in
the
company
of
a
pair
of
peacocks
the
philosopher
adjusted
his
eyeglasses
from
time
to
time
as
if
they
did
not
fit
well
he
seemed
to
feel
his
vision
growing
distorted
i
became
intensely
fatigued
with
it
all
and
found
myself
longing
for
a
quiet
corner
and
a
book
as
for
the
skeptic
but
the
skeptic
was
incorrigible
how
much
does
it
cost
do
you
say
he
inquired
of
the
promoter
to
buy
a
postage
stamp
at
the
desk
here
i
want
to
put
one
on
a
letter
i
have
in
my
pocket
may
i
slip
it
into
the
myself
or
do
i
have
to
call
a
flunkey
present
him
with
a
dollar
and
respectfully
request
him
to
insert
it
in
the
slit
for
me
the
promoter
smiled
oh
people
make
a
joke
of
the
amazon
said
he
but
i
notice
they
the
same
ones
who
breathe
deep
when
they
go
by
it
hoping
to
inhale
the
atmosphere
free
of
charge
the
skeptic
inflated
his
lungs
i
going
to
do
it
here
inside
said
he
where
it
more
highly
charged
at
length
they
took
us
to
their
own
rooms
i
have
forgotten
how
many
floors
up
they
were
but
it
did
matter
in
a
luxurious
elevator
padded
and
mirrored
in
one
of
the
mirrors
i
caught
the
eye
regarding
me
so
steadily
that
i
felt
a
sudden
sense
of
relief
at
the
realization
that
some
time
we
should
be
out
and
away
together
in
the
fresh
air
again
it
seemed
to
me
a
long
while
since
i
had
been
able
to
see
things
from
the
philosopher
point
of
view
we
looked
at
our
hosts
private
apartments
with
interest
as
the
skeptic
passed
me
on
his
way
to
inspect
a
system
of
electrical
devices
on
the
wall
to
which
the
promoter
was
calling
his
attention
he
was
softly
humming
an
air
it
was
it
ever
so
again
the
rooms
were
very
elaborately
furnished
the
hangings
were
heavy
and
sumptuous
a
massive
oak
mantelpiece
harboured
a
fire
of
there
were
a
few
not
many
apparently
personal
belongings
about
the
rooms
and
photographs
the
latter
mostly
of
actors
and
opera
singers
in
althea
bedroom
we
came
upon
a
which
reminded
me
of
my
own
upon
the
occasion
of
althea
visit
to
me
a
few
years
before
althea
calmly
stirred
over
everything
upon
it
in
the
effort
to
find
a
small
whose
contents
she
wished
to
show
me
she
found
it
in
the
end
although
for
a
time
the
task
seemed
hopeless
we
sat
down
in
the
outer
room
and
listened
again
to
the
promoter
tales
of
the
great
strokes
of
business
he
had
brought
off
deals
he
called
them
the
stories
contained
much
food
for
thought
in
the
shape
of
revelations
of
character
in
this
or
that
man
of
prominence
what
we
should
have
talked
about
if
he
had
not
thus
held
the
floor
i
could
not
guess
i
had
noted
that
there
were
upon
a
ponderous
table
six
popular
novels
as
many
magazines
and
piles
of
the
great
dailies
nowhere
could
i
descry
even
a
small
collection
of
books
of
the
sort
which
may
furnish
material
for
conversation
i
tried
to
imagine
the
philosopher
drawing
a
certain
beloved
book
of
essays
from
his
pocket
settling
himself
comfortably
with
his
back
to
the
and
beginning
to
read
aloud
to
us
as
he
is
accustomed
to
do
in
the
skeptic
little
rooms
here
was
not
even
a
for
him
to
do
it
by
only
electric
sconces
set
high
upon
the
walls
and
a
fanciful
centre
electrolier
he
must
perforce
for
he
needs
a
strong
light
for
reading
have
stood
close
under
one
of
the
sconces
to
read
from
his
book
of
essays
i
tried
to
fancy
althea
and
the
promoter
politely
listening
or
appearing
to
listen
this
really
drew
too
heavily
upon
my
imagination
and
i
gave
it
up
at
a
late
hour
we
escaped
i
learned
afterward
that
before
we
left
the
promoter
took
our
men
aside
and
offered
them
one
more
thing
to
drink
this
really
seemed
superfluous
and
judging
by
the
straightforward
gait
of
our
escorts
to
say
nothing
of
my
knowledge
of
their
habits
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
was
outside
the
hotel
the
philosopher
looking
away
from
it
and
from
the
other
great
buildings
which
surrounded
us
on
every
side
sent
his
gaze
upward
to
the
starry
winter
sky
he
drew
in
deep
breaths
of
the
frosty
air
getting
the
amazon
out
of
your
blood
inquired
the
skeptic
a
mighty
good
name
for
it
it
thinks
it
sophisticated
and
refined
but
it
is
it
a
great
blowsy
milkmaid
of
a
hotel
with
all
her
best
clothes
on
perpetually
going
to
a
fair
i
not
so
much
my
insulted
lungs
said
the
philosopher
as
drawing
breaths
of
relief
that
i
got
away
without
buying
a
block
of
stock
in
something
or
putting
my
name
down
to
be
one
of
a
company
for
the
development
of
something
else
oh
we
were
safe
enough
the
skeptic
declared
this
was
a
private
dinner
with
ladies
present
the
promoter
gave
us
only
a
delicate
sample
of
what
he
could
do
wait
till
he
gets
you
at
luncheon
with
him
in
the
all
by
yourself
then
you
can
find
out
what
he
is
when
after
game
unless
you
tied
to
the
mast
so
to
speak
with
your
ears
stopped
with
wax
you
land
on
the
shore
of
the
enchanted
country
he
pictures
for
you
he
deadly
i
assure
you
that
why
he
can
afford
to
live
at
the
amazon
i
wonder
how
althea
likes
it
speculated
hepatica
likes
it
down
to
the
ground
and
up
to
the
roof
asserted
the
skeptic
that
plain
enough
it
saves
housekeeping
and
picking
up
her
room
he
added
softly
to
hepatica
but
i
heard
him
hepatica
did
not
reply
let
not
stop
at
this
station
proposed
the
skeptic
as
we
walked
on
but
keep
on
up
to
the
next
a
fast
walk
will
do
us
all
good
after
that
feast
of
porpoises
i
suppose
they
call
that
living
said
the
philosopher
as
we
turned
aside
into
quieter
streets
of
course
they
do
and
so
does
everybody
else
at
those
tables
with
four
exceptions
oh
come
demurred
the
philosopher
possibly
there
were
a
few
other
wise
men
in
that
company
besides
ourselves
who
would
have
known
from
your
appearance
as
you
sat
there
gorging
with
the
rest
that
you
were
inwardly
protesting
and
greatly
preferred
the
simple
life
flatter
yourself
that
you
had
the
aspect
of
an
ascetic
there
were
moments
during
that
meal
when
any
unprejudiced
observer
who
did
know
you
would
have
sworn
that
you
were
deeply
gratified
that
no
other
engagement
had
prevented
you
from
dining
in
your
favourite
haunt
do
throw
stones
retorted
the
skeptic
i
saw
you
when
you
caught
sight
of
some
particularly
prosperous
looking
people
at
another
table
and
bowed
convivially
to
them
as
one
who
says
here
too
of
course
our
set
you
know
quits
admitted
the
philosopher
well
then
it
the
ladies
who
did
succeed
in
looking
like
visitants
from
another
world
this
was
rather
poetical
for
the
philosopher
and
of
course
it
led
us
to
wonder
wherein
he
thought
we
differed
hepatica
asked
anxiously
if
she
really
had
looked
so
very
in
the
white
evening
frock
which
had
been
three
times
made
over
hopelessly
assented
the
philosopher
hopelessly
but
not
so
much
in
the
matter
of
the
frock
as
in
some
other
things
heaven
forbid
that
it
should
be
otherwise
amen
responded
the
skeptic
fervently
v
rhodora
and
the
preacher
when
the
fight
begins
within
himself
a
man
worth
something
the
skeptic
brought
up
the
letter
with
him
as
he
came
home
to
dinner
it
had
arrived
in
the
last
mail
the
philosopher
happened
to
be
dining
with
us
that
night
so
we
four
were
together
when
the
news
came
upon
us
as
hepatica
read
it
aloud
we
stared
at
one
another
astonished
the
letter
was
from
grandmother
inviting
us
to
rhodora
wedding
which
was
to
take
place
under
her
roof
rhodora
herself
had
been
practically
under
grandmother
roof
for
four
years
now
except
as
she
had
been
sent
to
a
school
of
grandmother
selection
rhodora
had
no
mother
her
father
an
absorbed
man
of
business
had
at
grandmother
suggestion
been
glad
to
let
her
have
the
girl
to
bring
up
or
to
finish
bringing
up
according
to
her
own
ideas
when
we
had
first
seen
rhodora
there
could
be
no
question
that
she
sadly
needed
bringing
up
by
somebody
to
that
date
she
had
apparently
only
come
up
by
herself
i
for
one
have
never
seen
her
since
that
visit
she
made
you
that
summer
said
the
skeptic
reminiscently
it
has
never
occurred
to
me
to
long
to
see
her
again
she
was
a
mere
lusty
infant
then
and
now
she
to
be
married
how
time
gets
on
what
did
you
say
was
the
name
of
the
unfortunate
chap
reverend
christopher
austen
hepatica
from
the
letter
he
will
need
all
the
fortitude
the
practice
of
his
profession
can
have
developed
in
him
if
my
recollections
can
be
depended
upon
to
furnish
a
basis
for
the
present
outlook
said
the
skeptic
gloomily
you
do
know
that
he
will
at
all
i
disputed
rhodora
was
only
a
girl
when
you
saw
her
she
has
been
four
years
under
influence
since
then
can
you
imagine
that
has
accomplished
nothing
the
skeptic
shook
his
head
that
would
be
like
a
dove
attempting
the
education
of
a
hawk
the
girl
has
probably
learned
not
to
break
into
the
conversation
of
her
elders
with
an
axe
he
speculated
nor
to
walk
ahead
of
grandmother
when
she
comes
into
a
room
any
girl
learns
those
things
in
time
unless
she
is
an
idiot
but
there
are
other
things
to
learn
you
ca
make
fine
china
out
of
coarse
clay
but
you
can
make
very
very
beautiful
pottery
cried
hepatica
and
the
lump
of
clay
that
came
into
contact
with
grandmother
wheel
she
paused
metaphors
are
sometimes
difficult
things
to
handle
the
philosopher
musing
did
not
notice
that
she
had
not
finished
it
rather
curious
that
i
should
be
asked
he
said
i
never
saw
either
of
them
but
once
you
made
a
great
conquest
on
that
one
occasion
though
said
the
skeptic
nonsense
the
philosopher
coloured
like
a
boy
that
girl
not
that
girl
explained
the
skeptic
the
old
lady
she
has
never
ceased
to
ask
after
you
whenever
we
have
seen
her
or
heard
from
her
as
i
remember
you
presented
her
with
a
bunch
of
garden
flowers
as
big
as
your
head
and
looked
at
her
as
if
she
were
eighteen
and
the
beauty
she
undoubtedly
once
well
well
a
preacher
what
has
rhodora
become
that
she
has
blinded
the
eyes
of
a
preacher
not
that
their
eyes
are
not
easily
blinded
why
do
you
say
inquired
his
wife
grandmother
letter
says
a
young
clergyman
he
no
clergyman
insisted
the
skeptic
he
not
even
a
minister
he
just
a
preacher
a
raw
youth
just
out
of
college
knows
as
much
about
women
as
a
puppy
about
elephant
training
rhodora
probably
sang
a
hymn
at
one
of
his
meetings
and
finished
him
well
well
i
suppose
this
means
another
wedding
present
he
looked
dubiously
at
hepatica
it
does
of
course
she
admitted
send
her
a
he
suggested
preparing
savagely
to
carve
a
plump
young
duck
anything
less
adapted
to
the
use
of
a
preacher
family
i
ca
conceive
and
that
the
main
object
in
buying
wedding
gifts
according
to
my
observation
the
day
of
rhodora
wedding
arrived
and
we
went
down
together
to
grandmother
lovely
old
country
home
a
stately
house
upon
the
banks
of
a
wide
frozen
river
our
train
brought
us
there
two
hours
before
the
one
set
for
the
ceremony
and
we
found
not
only
grandmother
but
rhodora
and
the
preacher
in
the
fine
to
greet
us
the
wedding
was
to
be
a
quietly
informal
one
and
such
of
the
other
guests
as
had
already
arrived
were
in
the
room
also
having
a
cup
of
tea
before
they
should
go
upstairs
to
dress
rhodora
herself
was
pouring
the
tea
and
the
preacher
was
helping
hand
the
cups
about
it
was
a
beautiful
opportunity
to
observe
the
pair
before
their
marriage
grandmother
gave
us
the
welcome
only
grandmother
knows
how
to
give
in
her
own
home
she
looks
like
a
fair
little
old
queen
receiving
everybody
homage
yet
giving
so
much
kindness
in
return
that
one
can
never
feel
one
self
out
of
debt
to
her
hospitality
her
greeting
to
the
philosopher
was
an
especially
cordial
one
i
ventured
to
ask
you
she
said
to
him
because
i
have
always
wanted
to
see
you
again
not
merely
because
i
have
heard
of
you
in
the
world
where
you
are
making
a
name
for
yourself
and
i
wanted
too
in
justice
to
my
granddaughter
to
have
you
see
her
again
before
the
philosopher
could
formulate
an
appropriate
reply
rhodora
herself
leaving
her
and
crossing
the
room
with
a
swift
and
graceful
tread
was
giving
us
welcome
it
was
amusing
to
see
our
two
men
look
at
rhodora
hepatica
and
i
had
been
in
a
way
prepared
to
see
a
transformation
having
heard
sundry
rumours
to
that
effect
but
the
skeptic
and
the
philosopher
having
classified
rhodora
once
and
for
all
had
since
received
no
impression
sufficient
to
efface
or
modify
the
original
one
i
can
say
for
them
that
to
one
who
did
not
know
them
well
their
surprise
would
have
been
undiscoverable
yet
to
hepatica
and
me
it
was
perfectly
evident
that
they
considered
a
miracle
had
been
wrought
as
to
personal
appearance
rhodora
had
developed
as
she
had
promised
to
do
into
a
remarkable
beauty
if
she
had
kept
on
as
she
had
begun
she
would
have
become
one
of
those
exuberant
beauties
who
look
as
if
they
had
but
lately
quitted
the
stage
and
must
shortly
return
thither
even
yet
it
would
have
taken
but
an
error
in
dress
a
reversion
to
a
certain
type
of
manner
which
too
often
goes
with
looks
like
these
to
make
of
the
girl
that
which
it
had
seemed
she
must
become
but
somehow
she
had
not
become
that
thing
rhodora
presently
turned
and
beckoned
to
the
preacher
and
putting
down
his
teacups
he
came
to
her
side
she
presented
him
and
we
saw
that
he
was
indeed
no
clergyman
no
minister
even
in
the
sense
that
the
skeptic
had
differentiated
these
terms
but
a
preacher
and
an
embryo
one
at
that
a
big
boy
a
straightforward
young
fellow
who
meant
to
do
all
the
good
in
the
world
in
all
the
ways
that
he
could
bring
about
he
was
but
lately
graduated
from
his
seminary
had
yet
to
preach
his
first
sermon
after
the
dignities
of
his
ordination
but
one
could
not
tell
how
one
began
to
believe
in
him
at
once
no
i
have
a
bit
of
experience
he
owned
to
me
as
we
stood
talking
together
getting
acquainted
not
a
bit
except
a
little
mission
work
a
few
of
us
went
in
for
this
last
year
i
as
raw
a
recruit
as
ever
put
on
a
uniform
and
fell
in
with
the
rest
of
the
company
for
his
first
drill
but
i
mean
to
count
one
i
sure
you
will
said
i
regarding
him
with
growing
pleasure
in
the
sight
and
rhodora
will
count
two
said
he
his
eyes
following
her
one
and
two
side
by
side
you
know
stand
for
twelve
so
they
do
said
i
and
seeing
rhodora
as
she
looks
now
i
should
think
she
would
make
an
efficient
comrade
his
face
glowed
together
we
observed
rhodora
standing
close
by
grandmother
side
the
two
with
hepatica
and
our
two
men
made
a
group
of
which
not
the
but
grandmother
was
the
precise
centre
the
moment
rhodora
had
reached
grandmother
side
she
had
put
herself
in
the
background
although
she
towered
above
the
little
old
lady
she
did
not
overwhelm
her
and
grandmother
herself
had
never
seemed
a
more
gently
dominating
figure
than
now
in
her
sweeping
black
gown
with
its
rare
laces
her
white
hair
in
soft
puffs
framing
her
delicate
face
and
as
at
a
turn
in
the
conversation
grandmother
looked
up
at
rhodora
and
rhodora
bending
a
little
smiled
back
at
her
answering
in
the
most
deferential
way
it
was
clear
to
me
that
the
most
efficient
element
in
the
education
of
the
girl
had
been
her
intercourse
with
this
gentlewoman
it
was
seeing
those
two
together
said
the
preacher
rather
shyly
in
my
ear
that
attracted
me
first
i
never
knew
that
youth
and
age
could
set
each
other
off
like
that
till
i
saw
them
and
i
saw
at
once
that
a
girl
who
could
be
such
friends
with
an
old
lady
must
be
very
much
worth
while
herself
they
are
great
chums
you
know
it
quite
unusual
i
think
and
it
a
mighty
fine
thing
for
any
one
to
know
grandmother
i
learned
more
from
grandmother
than
from
any
one
i
ever
knew
she
a
very
rare
and
adorable
old
lady
i
agreed
heartily
we
all
worship
her
we
all
feel
that
to
be
near
her
is
a
special
fortune
for
any
one
she
has
plainly
grown
very
fond
of
rhodora
she
will
miss
her
no
doubt
of
that
he
agreed
but
quite
naturally
more
with
triumph
than
with
sympathy
we
went
upstairs
presently
to
make
ready
for
the
wedding
when
we
were
dressed
we
met
according
to
previous
agreement
in
the
big
square
upper
hall
with
its
spindled
railing
making
a
gallery
about
the
quaint
and
stately
staircase
it
was
a
little
too
early
to
go
down
and
we
drew
some
chairs
together
and
sat
down
to
look
at
one
another
in
our
wedding
garments
i
like
to
get
married
myself
again
declared
the
skeptic
forcibly
pulling
on
his
gloves
with
a
man
brutal
disregard
for
the
possible
instability
of
seams
he
eyed
his
wife
possessively
tell
me
will
the
preacher
bride
put
her
in
the
shade
don
but
hepatica
falling
lashes
could
not
quite
conceal
her
pleasure
in
his
pride
not
for
a
minute
the
philosopher
benevolent
gaze
approved
of
his
friend
wife
from
the
top
of
her
masses
of
shining
hair
to
the
tip
of
her
foot
at
the
same
time
i
do
feel
quite
such
a
dispirited
compassion
for
the
preacher
himself
as
i
did
on
the
way
down
can
that
possibly
be
the
same
girl
who
treated
grandmother
as
if
she
were
an
inconvenient
antique
family
relic
and
the
rest
of
us
as
if
she
endured
but
was
horribly
bored
by
us
i
have
never
supposed
grandmothers
said
the
skeptic
thoughtfully
to
be
particularly
influential
members
of
society
evidently
ours
is
different
but
there
must
have
been
other
elements
in
the
metamorphosis
of
rhodora
miss
eleanor
lockwood
school
suggested
hepatica
you
mention
that
with
bated
breath
said
the
skeptic
precisely
as
every
one
including
its
graduates
mentions
it
i
admit
that
miss
lockwood
school
is
a
place
where
rich
young
savages
are
turned
out
polished
members
of
society
but
there
been
more
than
that
the
preacher
himself
i
suggested
the
skeptic
looked
at
me
do
you
mean
to
imply
said
he
with
raised
eyebrows
that
any
woman
would
admit
the
possibility
of
acquaintanceship
with
any
particular
man
having
had
a
formative
influence
on
her
character
after
i
mean
of
course
why
not
i
inquired
what
influence
could
be
greater
the
skeptic
looked
at
the
philosopher
who
returned
his
gaze
calmly
did
you
ever
expect
to
hear
that
asked
the
skeptic
i
should
not
think
of
denying
the
influence
of
woman
upon
man
replied
the
philosopher
why
should
not
the
rule
work
both
ways
i
never
heard
it
thus
flatly
formulated
before
declared
the
skeptic
it
does
me
good
that
all
so
you
think
the
preacher
has
had
a
hand
in
the
reformation
you
have
seen
the
preacher
said
i
you
know
the
family
from
which
he
comes
he
of
good
stock
you
only
to
hear
him
speak
to
see
that
he
a
man
of
purpose
of
action
of
training
boy
as
he
looks
how
could
he
fail
to
have
a
strong
influence
upon
a
girl
who
cared
for
him
the
skeptic
looked
at
hepatica
do
you
agree
with
her
he
inquired
of
course
i
agree
with
her
responded
hepatica
looking
from
him
to
me
and
back
again
you
are
only
pretending
to
doubt
us
both
it
very
clever
of
you
but
we
know
perfectly
that
you
understand
how
far
very
far
we
are
affected
by
your
ideals
your
judgments
your
whole
estimate
of
life
therefore
you
must
be
very
careful
how
you
use
your
influence
with
us
the
skeptic
gave
her
back
the
look
he
saw
in
her
eyes
ah
you
two
belong
to
the
wise
ones
he
said
the
wise
ones
who
magnifying
our
hold
on
you
thus
acquire
a
far
more
tremendous
hold
on
us
eh
philo
the
philosopher
smiled
inscrutably
probably
he
felt
that
an
inscrutable
smile
was
his
safest
means
of
navigating
waters
like
these
we
went
down
to
the
wedding
the
preacher
stood
up
very
straight
while
he
was
being
married
and
though
his
boyish
cheek
paled
and
reddened
again
as
the
ceremony
proceeded
his
responses
were
rhodora
made
a
bonny
bride
the
absurd
vision
i
had
had
of
her
ever
since
i
had
heard
she
was
to
be
married
of
her
taking
the
officiating
clergyman
book
out
of
his
hand
and
steering
the
service
for
herself
melted
away
before
the
vision
of
her
serious
young
beauty
as
she
made
her
vows
and
turned
from
the
clergyman
felicitations
at
the
conclusion
of
the
service
to
take
grandmother
into
a
tender
embrace
i
owe
it
all
to
you
she
said
to
grandmother
by
and
by
in
my
hearing
as
we
three
happened
to
be
for
a
little
alone
together
she
turned
to
me
i
was
a
barbarian
when
she
took
me
she
said
a
barbarian
of
barbarians
if
it
had
been
for
grandmother
i
should
be
one
yet
and
he
her
glance
went
off
for
an
instant
toward
her
young
husband
would
never
have
dreamed
of
looking
at
me
you
were
not
very
different
my
dear
said
grandmother
in
her
gentle
way
from
many
girls
of
this
day
forgive
me
dear
responded
rhodora
but
i
was
so
much
worse
that
only
a
grandmother
like
you
could
have
shown
me
what
i
was
i
never
tried
to
show
you
what
you
were
said
grandmother
only
what
you
could
be
and
now
i
must
lose
you
the
preacher
came
up
the
skeptic
by
his
side
the
philosopher
and
hepatica
seeing
the
old
magic
circle
forming
promptly
added
themselves
it
fell
out
presently
that
the
philosopher
and
i
a
step
away
from
the
others
were
observing
them
as
we
talked
together
the
philosopher
had
adjusted
his
eyeglasses
having
carefully
polished
them
he
seemed
to
want
to
see
things
clearly
this
is
a
scene
i
witnessed
a
good
many
times
first
and
last
said
he
each
time
it
impresses
me
afresh
with
the
daring
of
the
participants
brave
young
things
setting
sail
upon
a
mighty
ocean
in
a
small
boat
which
may
or
may
not
be
seaworthy
some
of
them
it
seems
sometimes
with
neither
chart
nor
compass
certainly
with
little
knowledge
of
the
crew
it
a
trite
comparison
i
suppose
you
talk
as
if
you
stood
safely
on
the
shore
i
ventured
is
life
no
ocean
to
you
then
and
do
you
never
feel
adrift
upon
it
the
philosopher
stared
curiously
at
me
it
was
i
admit
a
strange
speech
for
me
to
make
to
him
but
i
had
not
been
thinking
of
him
i
had
been
thinking
of
lad
my
big
boy
now
away
at
school
and
of
the
day
when
he
should
reach
this
experience
for
himself
and
i
should
have
to
give
him
up
my
one
near
tie
i
should
surely
feel
adrift
in
that
day
far
adrift
does
it
seem
to
you
like
that
he
asked
very
gently
after
a
minute
i
looked
up
and
saw
a
new
and
quite
strange
expression
in
his
kindly
eyes
no
no
i
said
hastily
how
could
it
with
so
many
and
such
good
friends
i
think
he
would
have
questioned
me
further
but
the
skeptic
at
that
moment
turned
my
way
and
i
laid
hold
upon
him
figuratively
speaking
and
did
not
let
go
again
till
all
danger
of
a
discussion
with
the
philosopher
on
the
subject
of
my
loneliness
was
past
vi
wistaria
and
the
philosopher
friendship
needs
delicate
handling
after
all
this
dining
and
of
you
said
hepatica
suddenly
one
morning
toward
the
close
of
my
visit
you
are
not
to
escape
without
our
giving
a
dinner
for
you
oh
my
dear
i
began
after
all
you
have
done
for
me
surely
that
is
necessary
i
have
had
yes
i
know
you
have
had
dinners
and
dinners
including
the
philosopher
bachelor
repast
which
might
or
might
not
be
called
by
that
name
but
was
certainly
great
fun
but
i
want
to
give
you
a
dinner
myself
better
let
her
advised
the
skeptic
who
was
putting
on
his
overcoat
at
the
time
preparatory
to
leaving
us
for
the
day
it
wo
be
like
anything
of
that
name
you
have
ever
tried
before
besides
she
wants
you
to
meet
wistaria
who
is
wistaria
i
asked
they
both
looked
at
me
then
they
looked
at
each
other
has
philo
told
you
about
wistaria
inquired
the
skeptic
in
evident
surprise
was
she
at
his
oh
that
right
she
was
out
of
town
well
she
back
and
you
must
meet
her
she
a
mighty
fine
girl
or
if
not
exactly
a
girl
woman
philo
admires
her
rather
more
than
he
condescends
to
admire
most
women
i
should
say
any
errands
for
me
patty
all
right
dear
he
kissed
her
and
ran
for
his
car
i
stood
looking
out
of
the
window
after
him
it
struck
me
rather
suddenly
that
it
was
a
gray
day
outside
with
heavy
clouds
threatening
to
make
the
sky
even
darker
there
was
a
touch
of
gloom
in
the
whole
outer
aspect
of
things
hepatica
immediately
set
about
making
preparations
for
her
dinner
it
would
be
most
informal
she
assured
me
and
as
i
heard
her
giving
her
invitations
over
the
telephone
i
recognized
from
their
character
that
it
would
be
so
even
though
i
heard
her
inviting
quite
a
party
including
camellia
and
the
judge
dahlia
and
the
professor
althea
and
the
promoter
and
azalea
and
the
cashier
a
strange
man
a
mining
engineer
was
included
in
the
list
to
make
the
tale
of
numbers
evenly
divided
i
judged
he
was
likely
to
fall
to
me
in
the
final
disposition
of
the
guests
at
hepatica
table
and
inquired
what
he
was
like
he
delightful
replied
hepatica
enthusiastically
you
be
sure
to
like
him
he
lost
his
wife
about
five
years
ago
but
has
and
lives
mostly
at
his
club
as
he
has
no
children
he
devoted
to
his
work
and
has
a
good
big
reputation
though
he
still
in
the
early
forties
hepatica
would
not
tell
me
what
she
meant
to
have
for
her
dinner
but
on
the
appointed
day
shut
herself
up
in
her
kitchen
with
a
young
woman
whom
she
had
engaged
and
would
allow
me
only
to
set
her
table
for
her
as
i
laid
the
required
number
of
forks
and
spoons
i
realized
that
she
meant
to
be
true
to
her
word
and
serve
a
quite
simple
dinner
for
this
i
was
thankful
for
some
reason
which
i
could
not
just
understand
myself
i
was
dreading
that
dinner
more
than
anything
that
had
happened
for
a
long
time
the
evening
came
i
dressed
without
enthusiasm
putting
on
the
frock
which
hepatica
had
insisted
upon
and
pinning
on
a
bunch
of
violets
which
arrived
for
me
at
almost
the
last
moment
without
any
card
in
the
box
hepatica
had
three
magnificent
red
roses
at
the
same
time
it
was
like
the
skeptic
to
be
so
thoughtful
the
guests
arrived
camellia
superbly
attired
althea
gorgeously
so
dahlia
in
youthful
pink
and
white
azalea
in
a
demurely
simple
dress
whose
laces
were
just
a
thought
rumpled
about
the
neck
and
had
to
be
straightened
out
by
my
assisting
fingers
little
bud
she
explained
had
insisted
on
hugging
her
violently
at
the
last
moment
before
he
would
allow
her
to
come
away
wistaria
came
last
so
that
as
we
all
stood
grouped
about
the
little
rooms
i
had
a
fine
chance
to
see
her
arrival
she
had
to
go
through
the
room
in
which
we
were
to
reach
hepatica
bedroom
and
i
saw
a
tall
and
graceful
figure
all
in
black
under
a
white
evening
cloak
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
pair
of
brilliant
dark
eyes
under
the
white
silken
scarf
which
enveloped
her
hair
but
when
she
came
out
in
hepatica
company
i
saw
undisguised
one
of
the
most
attractive
women
i
had
ever
met
she
unusual
is
she
said
the
skeptic
in
my
ear
as
having
welcomed
the
new
guest
and
watched
hepatica
present
her
to
me
he
fell
back
at
my
side
wistaria
had
greeted
the
philosopher
with
the
quiet
warmth
of
manner
which
means
assured
acquaintance
and
the
two
had
remained
together
while
we
waited
for
the
serving
of
the
dinner
she
is
very
charming
i
agreed
it
is
her
manner
quite
as
much
as
her
face
is
it
she
must
be
well
worth
knowing
we
think
so
said
he
he
seemed
to
be
regarding
me
quite
steadily
i
wondered
uneasily
if
i
were
not
looking
well
the
rooms
seemed
rather
the
presence
of
so
many
people
in
such
a
small
space
is
apt
to
make
the
air
oppressive
also
i
remembered
that
the
effect
of
is
not
to
heighten
one
colouring
wistaria
all
in
filmy
black
from
which
her
white
shoulders
rose
like
a
flower
wore
one
splendid
american
beauty
rose
somehow
i
felt
quite
suddenly
that
is
a
meaningless
tint
the
mere
shadow
of
a
colour
of
less
character
than
white
of
immeasurably
less
beauty
than
simple
black
itself
i
caught
the
philosopher
eye
apparently
fixed
for
a
moment
upon
my
violets
and
i
wondered
with
a
queer
little
sensation
of
disquiet
if
even
they
seemed
to
be
without
character
also
then
dinner
was
announced
and
i
shook
myself
mentally
and
looked
up
smiling
at
my
mining
engineer
who
was
truly
a
man
worth
knowing
and
a
most
pleasant
gentleman
besides
and
went
to
dinner
with
him
determined
that
if
i
must
look
characterless
i
would
not
be
characterless
nor
make
my
companion
long
to
get
away
wistaria
and
the
philosopher
sat
exactly
opposite
the
mining
engineer
on
my
one
side
and
the
judge
on
my
other
kept
me
too
busy
to
spend
much
time
in
noting
wistaria
captivating
presence
or
the
absorption
yet
at
moments
when
some
sally
of
the
skeptic
who
sat
upon
wistaria
other
side
brought
the
attention
of
the
whole
company
to
bear
upon
that
quarter
of
the
table
i
found
myself
unable
to
help
noting
two
things
one
was
that
i
had
never
seen
the
philosopher
so
roused
and
ready
of
speech
the
other
that
i
had
never
quite
appreciated
how
distinguished
he
has
of
late
years
grown
in
appearance
possibly
this
was
because
i
had
not
had
the
chance
to
view
him
under
just
these
conditions
possibly
also
it
was
because
he
literally
was
growing
distinguished
in
the
world
of
scientific
research
and
his
name
becoming
one
cited
as
an
authority
in
a
certain
important
field
the
dinner
itself
i
can
not
describe
for
the
sufficient
reason
that
i
can
not
now
recall
one
solitary
thing
i
ate
but
the
impression
remains
with
me
that
it
was
really
an
extraordinarily
simple
dinner
that
everything
was
delicious
and
that
one
rose
up
from
it
with
a
sense
of
having
been
daintily
fed
not
stuffed
i
sure
i
could
not
pay
it
a
higher
or
a
rarer
compliment
after
dinner
the
promoter
told
stories
of
deals
to
which
the
professor
listened
curiously
watching
the
speaker
as
he
might
have
gently
eyed
some
strange
specimen
in
the
world
of
insects
or
of
birds
the
judge
and
the
cashier
hobnobbed
for
a
while
then
the
judge
made
his
way
to
the
side
of
wistaria
and
remained
there
for
an
indefinite
period
both
looking
deeply
interested
in
their
conversation
the
engineer
attempted
to
make
something
of
althea
but
presently
gave
it
up
spent
a
few
moments
with
camellia
and
came
back
to
me
by
and
by
azalea
and
the
cashier
sang
a
duet
for
us
and
after
some
persuasion
azalea
then
sang
alone
altogether
the
evening
got
on
somehow
it
is
all
very
hazy
in
my
mind
except
for
one
singular
fact
i
did
not
spend
a
moment
with
the
philosopher
how
this
happened
i
do
not
know
and
it
was
so
unusual
that
it
seemed
noteworthy
it
was
not
because
he
was
not
several
times
in
my
immediate
vicinity
but
i
was
always
at
the
moment
so
engaged
with
whomever
happened
to
be
talking
with
me
that
i
had
not
time
to
turn
and
include
the
philosopher
in
the
interview
when
our
guests
departed
they
went
together
having
one
and
the
same
car
to
catch
all
but
wistaria
who
had
come
in
her
own
private
carriage
which
was
late
in
arriving
to
take
her
home
the
philosopher
had
remained
with
her
and
he
took
her
down
to
her
carriage
i
can
not
remember
seeing
anything
more
attractive
than
wistaria
personality
as
she
said
good
night
her
sparkling
face
all
winsome
cordiality
her
white
scarf
lying
lightly
upon
the
masses
of
her
black
hair
the
crimson
rose
nodding
from
the
folds
of
her
long
white
cloak
pretty
fine
looking
pair
are
they
observed
the
skeptic
with
an
expansive
grin
the
moment
the
door
had
closed
upon
wistaria
and
the
philosopher
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
and
yawned
mightily
wistaria
almost
as
tall
as
philo
is
she
a
superb
woman
i
never
saw
her
looking
so
well
agreed
hepatica
straightening
chairs
and
settling
couch
pillows
trailing
here
and
there
in
her
pretty
frock
with
all
the
energy
of
the
early
morning
as
if
it
were
not
eleven
by
the
little
mantel
clock
did
you
like
her
dear
she
threw
an
eager
glance
at
me
she
was
in
the
restless
mood
of
the
hostess
who
wishes
to
be
assured
that
everything
has
gone
well
i
was
charmed
with
her
said
i
i
had
not
meant
to
take
a
seat
again
i
was
weary
and
wanted
to
get
away
to
bed
i
never
knew
how
beautiful
an
american
beauty
rose
was
till
i
saw
it
beneath
her
face
the
skeptic
turned
in
his
chair
and
looked
at
me
well
done
he
cried
could
have
said
it
better
myself
we
must
tell
philo
that
speech
he
be
deeply
gratified
he
has
every
confidence
in
your
taste
the
dinner
was
perfect
i
went
on
i
never
imagined
one
so
cleverly
planned
and
everybody
seemed
in
great
spirits
there
was
a
dull
moment
you
dear
thing
said
hepatica
and
came
and
dropped
a
kiss
upon
my
hair
it
fun
to
do
things
for
you
you
so
appreciative
did
you
enjoy
your
mining
engineer
he
was
so
entertaining
said
i
that
if
it
had
been
any
other
dinner
than
that
one
i
should
have
known
what
i
was
eating
hear
hear
applauded
the
skeptic
bouquets
for
us
all
did
i
make
an
ideal
host
your
geniality
was
rivalled
only
by
your
tact
i
declared
they
laughed
together
then
the
skeptic
sat
up
he
got
up
and
strode
over
to
the
window
and
peered
down
philo
is
taking
a
disgracefully
long
time
to
see
the
lady
into
her
carriage
he
observed
i
supposed
he
be
back
to
talk
it
over
as
usual
the
best
of
entertaining
is
the
talking
your
guests
over
after
they
gone
eh
patty
girl
i
seem
to
see
the
carriage
perhaps
he
gone
home
with
her
i
laid
my
hand
upon
the
door
of
my
room
i
do
know
why
i
am
so
sleepy
i
apologized
it
only
came
over
me
since
the
door
closed
but
you
must
both
be
tired
too
and
we
have
to
be
up
in
the
morning
at
the
usual
hour
hepatica
looked
regretful
but
she
did
not
urge
me
to
remain
i
felt
guilty
at
leaving
a
host
and
hostess
who
wanted
to
talk
things
over
but
really
i
the
perfume
from
my
violets
had
been
stealing
away
my
nerves
all
the
evening
i
felt
that
i
must
take
them
off
or
grow
faint
at
their
odour
which
seemed
stronger
as
they
drooped
i
opened
my
door
turned
to
smile
back
at
the
pair
and
shut
it
upon
the
inside
a
moment
later
i
was
standing
by
my
window
which
i
had
thrown
wide
and
the
winter
wind
was
lifting
the
violets
which
i
had
already
forgotten
to
take
off
i
heard
the
murmur
of
voices
in
the
room
outside
but
it
soon
ceased
with
no
third
person
to
praise
the
feast
it
was
probably
dull
work
congratulating
each
other
on
its
success
by
and
by
i
do
know
when
it
happened
i
heard
the
electric
whirr
in
the
tiny
hall
and
the
skeptic
go
to
answer
it
then
i
heard
voices
again
voices
there
was
an
interval
then
came
a
small
knock
at
my
door
i
opened
it
to
hepatica
the
philosopher
has
come
back
she
whispered
i
had
not
lit
my
light
i
had
closed
my
window
and
had
been
sitting
by
it
my
elbows
on
the
sill
hepatica
put
out
her
hand
and
felt
of
me
oh
you
undressed
she
said
then
wo
you
go
out
and
see
him
he
seemed
so
disappointed
when
don
said
you
had
gone
it
seems
he
called
out
of
town
quite
suddenly
he
afraid
he
may
not
be
back
before
you
go
he
says
he
did
have
a
chance
to
tell
you
about
it
this
evening
there
was
no
help
for
it
i
had
no
excuse
i
did
not
dare
to
snap
on
my
light
and
look
at
myself
i
put
my
hands
to
my
hair
to
feel
if
it
was
still
snug
then
i
went
hepatica
had
mercifully
turned
off
all
the
lights
but
the
on
the
and
two
of
the
electric
candles
in
the
it
was
a
relief
to
feel
the
glare
gone
the
air
from
the
window
had
freshened
me
the
philosopher
stood
by
the
upon
which
he
had
laid
his
hat
his
overcoat
was
on
a
chair
evidently
he
was
not
waiting
merely
to
say
and
go
the
skeptic
upon
my
entrance
immediately
crossed
the
room
to
the
door
of
the
hall
upon
which
his
own
room
opened
you
people
will
excuse
me
he
said
i
do
know
i
am
so
sleepy
his
tone
was
peculiar
and
i
recognized
that
he
was
quoting
my
words
of
a
before
it
only
came
over
me
since
the
door
closed
on
our
guests
and
i
have
to
be
up
in
the
morning
at
the
usual
hour
but
do
let
that
hurry
you
philo
old
man
and
he
vanished
the
philosopher
looked
as
if
he
did
not
mean
to
let
it
hurry
him
he
drew
his
chair
near
mine
facing
me
after
a
fashion
he
has
and
looked
at
me
in
silence
for
a
minute
you
are
tired
he
said
a
little
the
rooms
were
very
warm
they
were
they
made
the
violets
droop
i
see
i
put
up
my
hand
yes
i
meant
to
take
them
off
perhaps
you
do
like
violets
if
i
could
have
found
a
bunch
of
to
send
you
instead
like
those
in
your
own
garden
i
should
have
preferred
it
i
know
what
you
like
among
summer
flowers
but
with
these
florist
offerings
i
not
so
familiar
i
afraid
i
not
much
versed
in
the
sending
of
flowers
did
you
send
these
i
put
my
hand
up
to
them
again
they
certainly
were
drooping
sadly
perhaps
if
they
had
known
who
sent
them
to
be
sure
i
did
there
was
no
card
i
thought
it
was
don
and
forgot
to
thank
him
luckily
let
me
thank
you
now
they
have
been
so
sweet
all
the
evening
too
sweet
have
they
you
looked
a
bit
pale
i
thought
it
was
my
frock
gray
always
makes
people
look
pale
does
it
i
liked
that
frock
so
much
and
i
had
an
idea
gray
and
purple
went
together
they
do
beautifully
and
after
the
violets
have
been
in
water
they
be
quite
fresh
and
so
shall
i
to
tell
the
honest
truth
so
many
dinners
well
i
not
used
to
them
i
just
a
little
bit
glad
to
remember
that
spring
is
coming
on
soon
and
i
can
get
out
in
my
old
garden
and
dig
and
rake
and
watch
the
things
come
out
yes
you
one
of
the
outdoor
creatures
said
the
philosopher
leaning
back
in
his
chair
in
the
old
way
he
had
been
sitting
up
quite
straight
i
understand
it
i
like
gardens
myself
and
your
garden
most
of
all
do
you
realize
between
your
absences
and
my
long
stay
in
germany
it
three
summers
since
i
strolled
about
your
garden
so
long
yes
it
must
be
but
i
mean
to
be
at
home
this
summer
do
you
illustration
and
so
we
renewed
the
old
vow
i
yes
i
think
so
after
so
long
a
winter
outing
or
inning
i
could
bear
to
miss
the
garden
this
year
and
lad
will
be
home
his
first
vacation
he
is
fond
of
the
old
garden
too
may
i
come
asked
the
philosopher
rather
abruptly
to
stroll
about
the
garden
have
you
always
been
welcome
i
want
a
special
welcome
from
you
from
my
friend
when
a
man
has
only
one
friend
that
one
welcome
means
a
good
deal
to
him
only
one
you
have
so
many
have
i
yes
so
i
have
and
pleasant
friends
they
are
too
but
friendship
with
only
one
come
rhexia
you
understand
that
as
well
as
i
why
pretend
you
do
that
not
like
you
he
was
looking
at
me
very
steadily
he
leaned
forward
stretching
out
his
hand
i
laid
mine
in
it
and
so
we
renewed
the
old
vow
part
iii
i
sixteen
miles
to
one
passenger
off
the
coming
up
the
hill
announced
sue
boswell
peering
eagerly
out
of
the
inn
office
window
that
makes
nine
for
supper
i
run
and
tell
mother
nine
poor
child
murmured
tom
boswell
behind
the
desk
certainly
a
great
showing
for
a
summer
hotel
on
the
fifteenth
day
of
july
if
we
do
do
better
in
august
the
game
up
he
stared
out
of
the
window
at
the
approaching
guest
who
escorted
by
tom
brother
tim
was
climbing
the
road
toward
boswell
inn
at
a
pace
which
indicated
no
pressing
anxiety
to
arrive
as
the
pair
drew
nearer
tom
could
see
that
the
stranger
was
a
rather
person
of
medium
height
as
thin
as
a
lath
with
a
nearly
colourless
face
in
which
was
set
a
pair
of
black
eyes
with
dark
circles
round
them
the
man
had
somewhat
the
appearance
of
an
invalid
yet
an
air
of
subdued
nervous
energy
about
him
in
a
measure
offset
the
suggestion
of
he
was
surveying
boswell
inn
as
he
approached
it
in
a
comprehensive
way
which
seemed
to
take
in
every
feature
of
its
appearance
across
the
desk
in
the
small
lobby
the
newcomer
spoke
curtly
good
room
and
a
bath
i
want
an
absolutely
quiet
room
where
i
get
no
kitchen
noises
or
ballroom
dancing
windows
with
a
breeze
if
got
such
a
thing
i
ca
give
you
the
bath
tom
answered
regretfully
because
we
have
got
one
that
goes
with
any
room
in
the
house
but
you
can
have
plenty
of
hot
and
cold
in
cans
the
room
will
be
quiet
all
right
and
we
always
have
a
breeze
up
here
if
there
is
one
anywhere
in
the
world
shall
i
show
you
lead
on
assented
the
stranger
he
had
not
offered
to
register
though
tom
had
extended
to
him
a
freshly
dipped
pen
he
going
to
make
sure
first
thought
tom
recognizing
a
sign
of
the
experienced
traveller
he
led
the
way
himself
feeling
for
some
reason
unwilling
to
hand
young
tim
the
key
and
allow
him
to
exploit
the
rooms
as
they
mounted
the
stairs
tom
was
rapidly
considering
he
had
brought
along
three
keys
rather
an
unusual
act
on
his
part
it
was
hard
to
say
why
he
felt
it
necessary
to
bestow
any
special
attention
upon
this
guest
who
certainly
was
by
no
means
of
an
imposing
appearance
and
whose
dress
was
as
careless
as
his
manner
he
opened
the
door
of
the
first
room
and
the
stranger
looked
in
silently
i
show
you
another
before
you
decide
said
tom
hurriedly
without
waiting
for
a
comment
this
was
not
his
best
empty
room
and
he
felt
somehow
that
the
man
who
wanted
a
room
with
a
bath
and
a
breeze
knew
it
he
led
the
way
on
along
the
hall
to
a
corner
room
in
the
front
this
was
his
second
best
tom
always
preferred
to
reserve
his
choicest
for
a
chance
millionaire
or
a
possible
wealthy
society
lady
though
heaven
knew
that
during
the
six
weeks
the
inn
had
been
open
no
guest
distantly
resembling
one
or
the
other
of
those
desirable
types
had
approached
the
little
mountain
hostelry
anything
better
inquired
the
thin
man
his
extraordinarily
quick
glance
covering
every
detail
of
the
room
like
lightning
as
tom
felt
sure
if
you
want
the
bridal
suit
tom
pronounced
it
proudly
as
it
were
a
and
white
waistcoat
bring
her
on
tom
marched
ahead
to
the
two
rooms
opening
on
the
little
balcony
above
the
side
porch
a
balcony
which
belonged
to
the
bridal
suite
alone
and
which
commanded
the
finest
view
into
the
very
heart
of
the
mountains
that
the
house
afforded
seeing
his
guest
after
one
look
around
the
spotless
room
with
its
pink
and
white
furnishings
and
into
the
small
beyond
stride
toward
the
outer
door
tom
threw
it
wide
the
guest
stepped
out
on
to
the
balcony
here
he
pulled
off
his
hat
which
he
had
not
before
removed
and
let
the
breeze
for
there
was
unquestionably
a
breeze
even
on
this
afternoon
of
a
day
which
had
been
one
of
the
hottest
the
country
had
known
drift
refreshingly
against
his
damp
brow
the
zephyr
was
strong
enough
even
to
lift
slightly
the
thick
locks
of
black
hair
which
lay
above
the
white
forehead
price
for
this
asked
the
stranger
in
his
abrupt
way
turning
back
into
the
room
tom
mentioned
it
with
a
little
inward
hesitation
the
family
had
differed
a
good
deal
on
the
question
of
prices
for
these
best
rooms
in
his
opinion
that
settled
upon
for
the
bridal
suite
was
almost
prohibitively
high
not
a
guest
yet
but
had
turned
away
with
a
sigh
for
a
moment
he
had
been
tempted
to
reduce
it
but
he
had
promised
the
others
to
stick
by
the
decision
at
least
through
july
so
he
mentioned
the
price
firmly
the
guest
glanced
sharply
at
him
as
he
did
so
there
was
a
queer
little
contraction
of
the
stranger
thin
upper
lip
then
he
said
i
take
for
the
night
and
you
may
hold
for
me
till
night
tell
you
then
whether
i
stay
longer
tom
understood
of
course
that
it
was
now
a
question
of
a
satisfactory
table
but
here
he
knew
he
was
strong
mother
boswell
cooking
there
was
none
better
obtainable
he
was
already
in
a
hurry
to
prove
to
this
laconic
stranger
who
demanded
the
best
he
had
of
everything
including
breezes
that
in
the
matter
of
food
boswell
inn
could
satisfy
the
most
exacting
not
in
elaborately
dressed
viands
of
rare
kitchen
product
of
course
that
was
not
to
be
expected
off
here
but
in
temptingly
cooked
everyday
food
and
in
certain
extras
which
were
mother
boswell
specialties
and
which
the
few
people
now
in
the
inn
called
for
with
zest
though
they
seldom
deigned
to
send
any
special
word
of
praise
to
the
anxious
cook
boswell
needed
to
ask
forbearance
of
nobody
i
send
your
stuff
up
right
away
said
tom
as
the
other
man
cast
his
straw
hat
upon
a
chair
and
went
over
to
a
washstand
where
hung
several
snowy
towels
have
some
hot
water
yes
and
iced
all
right
tom
was
off
on
the
jump
it
was
certainly
something
to
have
rented
the
bridal
suite
even
for
the
night
but
he
felt
more
than
ordinarily
curious
to
know
who
his
guest
was
might
be
a
travelling
man
he
speculated
when
he
had
given
tim
his
orders
though
he
does
exactly
seem
like
one
but
he
looks
like
a
fellow
who
used
to
getting
what
he
wants
when
the
new
guest
came
downstairs
at
the
peal
of
a
gong
through
the
quiet
house
tom
saw
him
cast
one
glance
in
turn
at
each
of
the
other
occupants
of
the
lobby
as
they
clustered
about
the
door
of
the
seven
of
these
were
women
and
of
that
number
at
least
five
were
elderly
of
the
two
younger
ladies
neither
presented
any
special
attractiveness
beyond
that
of
entire
respectability
the
eighth
guest
was
a
man
a
man
who
was
reading
a
book
and
who
carried
the
book
into
the
with
him
where
he
continued
to
read
it
at
his
solitary
table
tom
boswell
was
at
the
elbow
of
the
latest
arrival
as
he
entered
the
a
long
low
but
airy
apartment
as
spotless
and
shining
in
its
way
as
the
bedroom
upstairs
had
been
there
was
no
head
waiter
and
tom
himself
piloted
the
new
guest
to
a
small
table
by
a
window
looking
off
into
the
mountains
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
house
from
that
of
the
bridal
suite
the
women
boarders
were
all
behind
him
the
solitary
man
just
across
the
way
at
a
corresponding
small
table
certainly
the
proprietor
of
boswell
inn
possessed
that
great
desideratum
for
such
an
official
tact
sue
boswell
aged
fifteen
in
a
print
frock
and
white
apron
so
crisp
that
one
could
not
discern
a
wrinkle
in
them
waited
on
the
new
guest
she
did
not
ask
him
what
he
would
have
nor
present
to
him
a
card
from
which
to
select
his
meal
she
brought
him
first
a
small
cup
of
chicken
broth
steaming
hot
and
though
he
regarded
this
at
first
as
if
he
had
no
appetite
whatever
after
the
first
tentative
sip
he
went
on
to
the
bottom
of
the
cup
when
this
was
gone
sue
placed
before
him
a
plate
of
hash
an
alluring
pinkness
showing
beneath
the
gratifying
upper
coat
of
brown
a
small
dish
of
cucumbers
thin
iced
cucumbers
with
a
french
dressing
accompanied
the
hash
and
with
these
he
was
offered
hot
rolls
so
small
and
delicate
and
crisp
that
after
cautiously
sampling
the
butter
with
what
seemed
a
fastidious
palate
the
guest
took
to
eating
rolls
as
if
he
had
seldom
found
anything
so
well
worth
consuming
something
made
of
red
raspberries
and
cream
followed
and
then
half
a
large
cantaloupe
its
golden
heart
filled
with
crushed
ice
was
placed
before
him
last
appeared
a
cup
of
amber
coffee
as
the
guest
tasted
this
beverage
a
look
of
complete
satisfaction
overspread
his
pale
face
and
he
drained
the
cup
clear
and
asked
for
more
presently
he
strolled
out
into
the
lobby
here
tom
awaited
him
behind
the
desk
the
hotel
register
was
open
and
tom
fingers
suggestively
held
a
pen
the
guest
obeyed
the
hint
at
an
inn
so
small
it
certainly
would
be
a
pity
for
any
guest
not
to
add
his
name
to
the
short
list
for
it
was
a
very
short
list
although
a
full
month
had
gone
by
since
the
first
arrival
had
written
her
name
the
bottom
of
the
page
had
not
been
quite
reached
when
this
latest
one
scratched
his
in
characters
which
looked
quite
as
much
like
arabic
as
english
when
tom
came
to
examine
the
name
later
he
made
it
out
to
be
perkins
though
it
might
quite
as
easily
have
been
tompkins
or
judson
or
any
other
name
which
had
an
elevated
letter
somewhere
in
the
middle
the
initials
were
quite
indecipherable
but
perkins
it
turned
out
to
be
for
when
tom
tentatively
addressed
the
newcomer
by
that
appellation
there
was
no
correction
made
and
he
continued
to
respond
whenever
so
accosted
perkins
spent
the
evening
smoking
upon
the
porch
his
head
turned
toward
the
mountains
the
next
morning
when
he
had
eaten
a
breakfast
which
included
some
wonderful
browned
and
syrup
another
of
the
inn
specialties
he
strolled
away
into
the
middle
distance
and
was
observed
by
various
of
the
guests
from
time
to
time
perched
about
among
the
rocks
in
idle
attitudes
he
a
queer
duck
observed
tom
in
the
kitchen
that
day
describing
perkins
to
his
mother
boswell
seldom
appeared
beyond
her
special
domain
that
of
the
kitchen
but
left
the
rest
of
the
housekeeping
to
her
daughters
bertha
and
sue
the
management
of
the
inn
to
tom
and
tim
silent
as
an
owl
seems
to
like
his
food
nothing
strange
about
that
he
does
act
sick
exactly
but
tired
or
bored
or
used
up
somehow
eyes
like
coals
and
sharper
than
a
ferret
i
ca
make
him
out
he
wo
talk
to
anybody
except
now
and
then
a
word
or
two
to
griffith
never
looks
at
the
ladies
but
i
tell
you
they
look
at
him
every
one
of
has
a
different
notion
about
him
anyhow
he
taken
the
bridal
suit
for
two
weeks
goes
down
to
the
for
his
mail
gave
particular
orders
not
to
have
it
sent
up
here
kind
of
funny
is
it
oh
i
meant
to
tell
you
before
he
paid
for
his
rooms
a
week
in
advance
it
helps
a
little
said
his
sister
bertha
she
was
years
old
and
if
any
one
of
this
family
had
the
responsibility
of
the
success
of
boswell
inn
heavily
and
anxiously
at
heart
it
was
bertha
but
it
ca
make
up
the
difference
here
july
half
over
and
not
a
dozen
people
in
the
house
what
can
be
the
matter
is
everything
all
right
sure
it
all
right
insisted
tom
we
just
have
got
known
that
all
but
how
are
we
going
to
get
known
if
nobody
comes
our
advertisement
in
the
city
papers
costs
dreadfully
and
it
does
seem
to
bring
anybody
now
see
here
said
tom
firmly
do
you
go
to
getting
discouraged
this
is
our
first
season
we
ca
expect
to
do
much
the
first
season
we
prepared
for
that
but
he
realized
quite
as
clearly
as
his
sister
that
they
had
not
been
prepared
for
so
complete
a
failure
as
they
were
making
boswell
inn
stood
only
sixteen
miles
away
from
a
large
city
a
great
western
railroad
centre
into
which
early
and
late
thousands
of
tourists
were
pouring
the
road
out
into
the
mountains
was
a
good
one
the
trip
easy
enough
for
the
owners
of
motor
cars
of
whom
the
city
held
enough
to
make
a
continuous
procession
all
the
way
if
only
they
could
be
headed
in
the
right
direction
but
how
to
head
them
that
was
what
tom
figure
out
on
the
third
evening
after
perkins
arrival
tom
strolling
gloomily
out
upon
the
porch
to
see
if
any
one
was
lingering
there
to
prevent
his
closing
up
discovered
perkins
sitting
alone
smoking
there
had
not
been
a
new
arrival
that
day
worse
one
of
the
elderly
ladies
had
gone
away
she
had
departed
reluctantly
but
her
absence
counted
just
the
same
and
tom
was
missing
her
as
he
had
never
expected
to
miss
any
elderly
lady
with
curls
and
a
cast
in
one
eye
nice
night
observed
tom
to
perkins
getting
cooled
off
a
bit
up
here
pretty
well
are
you
having
everything
you
want
tom
asked
the
question
with
some
diffidence
it
was
a
matter
of
regret
with
him
that
he
could
afford
yet
to
put
young
tim
into
buttons
but
without
them
he
was
sure
the
lad
made
as
alert
a
bellboy
and
porter
as
could
be
asked
nothing
to
complain
of
tom
wished
perkins
would
be
so
taciturn
the
proprietor
of
the
inn
that
could
get
a
start
was
feeling
so
blue
that
speech
with
some
one
besides
his
depressed
family
was
almost
a
necessity
he
could
talk
with
the
women
griffith
though
kindly
enough
had
his
nose
forever
buried
in
a
book
perkins
looked
as
if
he
could
talk
if
he
would
and
have
something
to
say
too
tom
tried
to
think
of
an
observation
which
would
draw
this
silent
man
out
but
quite
suddenly
and
greatly
to
tom
surprise
perkins
began
to
draw
tom
out
even
so
his
questions
were
like
shots
from
a
gun
so
brief
and
to
the
point
were
they
doing
any
advertising
broke
the
silence
first
from
a
corner
of
the
thin
mouth
perkins
cigar
had
been
shifted
to
the
opposite
corner
he
did
not
look
at
tom
but
continued
to
gaze
off
toward
a
certain
curious
effect
of
moonlight
against
the
rocky
sides
of
the
canyon
we
have
a
card
in
all
the
city
papers
any
specials
well
this
is
our
first
season
and
we
did
feel
as
if
we
could
afford
to
pay
for
that
no
pulls
eh
you
mean
no
friends
among
the
newspaper
men
i
do
know
one
they
do
seem
to
come
up
here
i
wish
they
would
ever
ask
one
i
do
know
any
repeated
tom
a
short
laugh
more
like
a
grunt
was
perkins
reply
tom
did
see
what
there
was
to
laugh
at
in
the
misfortune
of
having
no
acquaintance
among
the
writing
fellows
he
waited
eagerly
for
the
next
question
it
was
worth
a
good
deal
to
him
merely
to
have
this
outsider
show
a
spark
of
interest
in
the
fortunes
of
boswell
inn
when
did
you
open
up
it
came
just
as
he
feared
perkins
was
going
to
drop
the
subject
the
third
of
june
own
the
house
no
lease
it
cheap
it
an
old
place
but
we
put
all
we
could
afford
into
freshening
it
up
cook
a
permanent
one
the
form
of
the
question
perplexed
tom
for
an
instant
but
it
presently
resolved
itself
and
he
was
grinning
as
he
replied
sure
she
is
my
mother
do
you
like
her
cooking
ah
tom
would
tell
his
mother
that
the
young
man
flushed
slightly
in
the
darkness
of
the
porch
it
was
almost
the
first
compliment
that
had
been
paid
her
and
she
worked
like
a
slave
too
little
waitress
your
sister
yes
sue
young
but
we
think
she
does
pretty
well
delivers
the
goods
housekeeper
a
member
of
the
family
too
yes
and
tim
my
brother
oh
it
all
in
the
family
the
only
trouble
is
he
hesitated
lack
of
patronage
we
ca
keep
open
much
longer
if
things
do
improve
the
moment
the
words
were
out
tom
regretted
them
he
did
know
how
he
had
come
to
speak
them
he
had
meant
to
give
this
fact
away
certainly
there
had
been
nothing
particularly
sympathetic
in
the
tone
of
perkins
choppy
questions
but
the
other
man
next
words
knocked
his
regrets
out
of
his
mind
in
a
jiffy
could
you
entertain
a
dozen
men
at
supper
night
if
they
came
in
a
bunch
without
warning
give
us
the
chance
chance
might
happen
better
be
prepared
i
expect
to
be
away
over
night
myself
but
have
the
tip
that
a
crowd
may
be
coming
out
to
sample
the
place
it
may
be
a
mistake
do
know
we
be
ready
would
they
come
by
train
do
ask
me
none
of
my
picnic
merely
overheard
the
thing
suggested
and
perkins
rising
cast
away
the
stub
of
his
cigar
said
he
carelessly
enough
and
strolled
in
through
the
wide
hall
of
the
old
stone
house
tom
looked
after
him
as
he
mounted
the
stairs
the
young
innkeeper
spirits
had
gone
up
with
a
bound
a
dozen
men
to
supper
well
he
thought
they
could
entertain
them
he
would
go
and
tell
his
mother
and
bertha
on
the
instant
the
prospect
would
cheer
them
immensely
he
wondered
how
or
where
perkins
had
overheard
this
rumour
at
the
most
likely
it
was
a
gossipy
place
the
centre
of
the
tiny
burg
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
an
eighth
of
a
mile
away
where
a
dozen
small
shops
and
half
a
hundred
houses
strung
along
the
one
small
street
at
the
end
of
which
the
two
daily
trains
made
their
stops
the
dozen
men
had
come
and
gone
there
were
fourteen
of
them
to
be
exact
and
they
had
climbed
out
of
a
couple
of
big
touring
cars
with
sounds
of
hilarity
which
made
the
elderly
ladies
jump
in
their
chairs
they
had
swarmed
over
the
place
as
if
they
owned
it
had
talked
and
laughed
and
joked
and
shouted
all
in
a
perfectly
agreeable
way
which
woke
up
boswell
as
if
it
were
in
the
centre
of
somewhere
instead
of
off
in
the
mountains
they
had
scrawled
fourteen
vigorous
scrawls
upon
the
register
and
made
it
necessary
to
turn
the
page
this
of
itself
affording
the
clerk
a
satisfaction
quite
out
of
proportion
to
the
apparent
unimportance
of
the
incident
then
they
had
gone
gayly
in
to
supper
had
sat
about
two
stainless
tables
close
by
the
open
windows
and
had
been
waited
upon
by
both
sue
and
tim
in
such
alert
fashion
that
their
plates
arrived
almost
before
they
had
unfurled
their
napkins
out
in
the
kitchen
and
solicitous
boswell
had
sent
in
relays
of
broiled
chicken
young
and
tender
browned
as
only
artists
of
her
rank
can
brown
them
flanked
by
potatoes
cooked
in
a
way
known
only
to
herself
these
were
two
of
her
specialties
which
the
elderly
ladies
were
accustomed
to
enjoy
without
mentioning
it
pickles
and
jellies
such
as
the
fourteen
men
had
tasted
only
in
childhood
accompanied
these
dishes
and
the
little
hot
rolls
came
on
in
piles
which
melted
away
before
the
delighted
attacks
of
the
hungry
guests
so
that
the
kitchen
itself
became
alarmed
and
cut
the
elderly
ladies
a
trifle
short
at
which
complaints
were
promptly
filed
though
it
was
the
first
time
such
a
shortage
had
occurred
other
toothsome
dishes
followed
and
were
partaken
of
with
such
zest
and
so
many
frank
expressions
of
approval
that
sue
and
tim
carried
to
the
kitchen
reports
which
forced
their
mother
to
ask
them
to
stop
lest
she
lose
her
head
when
the
amber
coffee
with
a
fine
cheese
and
crisp
toasted
wafers
ended
the
meal
the
guests
were
in
such
a
state
of
satisfaction
that
tom
though
he
did
not
know
it
had
acquired
with
them
his
first
pull
he
did
not
know
it
not
then
he
only
knew
that
they
were
very
cordial
with
him
asking
him
a
good
many
interested
questions
and
that
one
requested
to
be
shown
rooms
remarking
that
his
wife
and
children
might
like
to
run
out
for
a
little
while
before
the
summer
was
over
most
of
them
looked
back
at
the
inn
as
the
automobiles
bore
them
away
and
one
waved
his
cigar
genially
at
tom
standing
on
the
top
step
he
was
standing
on
the
top
step
again
the
next
morning
when
perkins
returned
tom
was
wishing
perkins
had
been
there
the
night
before
to
see
confirmed
the
truth
of
the
rumour
he
had
reported
well
we
had
the
crowd
here
last
night
was
tom
greeting
as
perkins
sharp
black
eyes
looked
up
at
him
from
the
bottom
step
so
i
see
perkins
held
up
a
morning
paper
the
inevitable
cigar
was
in
his
mouth
his
face
indicated
no
particular
interest
he
went
along
into
the
house
as
tom
grasped
the
paper
so
he
saw
what
did
perkins
mean
by
that
it
could
be
that
any
of
that
party
of
men
had
unsolicited
taken
the
trouble
to
but
they
had
or
one
of
them
had
in
a
fairly
conspicuous
position
on
one
of
the
local
pages
of
the
best
city
daily
was
an
item
of
at
least
a
dozen
lines
setting
forth
the
fact
that
a
party
of
prominent
men
including
several
newspaper
men
had
taken
supper
the
night
before
at
boswell
inn
mount
o
pines
and
had
found
that
place
decidedly
attractive
the
paragraph
stated
that
such
a
supper
was
seldom
found
at
summer
hotels
added
that
the
air
and
the
view
were
worth
a
long
trip
to
obtain
when
the
city
was
sweltering
with
heat
and
ended
by
speaking
of
the
prime
condition
of
the
roads
leading
to
the
inn
altogether
it
was
such
an
item
as
tom
had
often
longed
to
see
and
the
reading
of
it
went
to
his
head
when
ten
minutes
later
tim
coming
up
from
the
with
the
mail
and
another
of
the
morning
papers
excitedly
called
tom
attention
to
a
second
paragraph
headed
have
you
had
a
supper
at
boswell
inn
tom
became
positively
delirious
it
pays
to
set
it
up
to
a
bunch
like
that
was
perkins
comment
when
tom
showed
him
this
second
free
advertisement
but
i
did
treat
them
they
paid
their
bills
cried
the
young
host
charge
your
usual
price
sure
we
did
have
anything
extra
except
the
cheese
tim
drove
ten
miles
for
that
usual
price
was
all
the
treat
those
fellows
needed
do
you
mean
you
do
think
i
charge
enough
tom
eyes
opened
wide
he
had
felt
as
if
he
were
robbing
those
men
when
he
counted
up
the
sum
total
ever
dine
at
the
arcadia
or
the
princess
no
they
do
tom
did
not
know
the
prices
at
these
imposing
popular
hotels
in
the
nearby
city
but
he
supposed
they
were
high
he
felt
as
if
he
were
the
greenest
innkeeper
who
ever
invited
the
patronage
of
city
guests
would
you
advise
me
to
put
up
the
price
tom
asked
presently
with
some
hesitation
perkins
glanced
at
him
out
of
those
worn
brilliant
black
eyes
of
his
which
looked
as
if
they
had
seen
more
of
the
world
than
tom
ever
would
see
in
the
longest
life
he
could
live
though
perkins
himself
could
hardly
be
over
forty
perhaps
not
quite
that
not
yet
son
said
he
by
and
by
yes
but
keep
up
the
quality
now
and
then
that
evening
a
young
man
whom
tom
recognized
as
one
of
the
party
of
the
night
before
the
one
who
had
waved
to
him
as
he
had
driven
away
appeared
again
he
came
in
a
runabout
this
time
and
brought
two
women
who
proved
to
be
his
mother
and
sister
the
young
man
himself
haskins
smiled
genially
at
tom
and
said
by
way
of
explanation
i
liked
your
place
so
well
i
brought
them
up
to
see
if
my
fairy
tales
were
true
upon
which
tom
naturally
did
his
best
to
make
the
fairy
tales
seem
true
and
thought
by
the
signs
he
noted
that
he
had
succeeded
during
the
following
week
three
or
four
others
of
the
men
of
the
original
fourteen
came
up
to
boswell
or
sent
small
parties
evidently
the
flattering
paragraphs
in
the
two
dailies
had
also
made
some
impression
on
people
eager
to
get
away
from
the
intense
heat
of
a
season
more
than
ordinarily
trying
they
found
the
air
stirring
upon
the
porches
and
through
the
rooms
at
the
inn
and
they
found
which
was
of
course
the
greater
attraction
a
table
so
inviting
with
appetizing
food
and
an
unpretentious
service
so
satisfactory
that
advertising
of
the
little
new
resort
that
means
of
becoming
known
began
gradually
but
surely
to
tell
strange
to
say
several
more
paragraphs
now
appeared
brief
crisp
mention
of
the
simple
but
perfect
cooking
to
be
had
for
the
short
drive
of
sixteen
miles
over
the
best
of
roads
these
inevitably
had
their
effect
and
at
the
end
of
the
third
week
tom
declared
to
perkins
that
he
was
more
than
making
expenses
much
more
inquired
that
gentleman
his
eyes
as
usual
upon
the
view
enough
so
we
satisfied
and
wo
have
to
close
up
why
there
been
from
one
to
three
big
autos
here
every
day
this
week
one
of
perkins
short
laughs
answered
this
tom
never
could
tell
just
what
that
throaty
chuckle
indicated
presently
he
found
out
what
you
want
boswell
said
perkins
removing
his
cigar
an
unusual
sign
of
interest
with
him
is
a
boom
i
like
to
see
you
get
it
gradual
building
up
all
right
but
quick
methods
pay
better
a
boom
how
on
earth
are
we
to
get
a
boom
tom
felt
a
bit
disconcerted
he
had
noticed
for
several
days
an
increasing
restlessness
in
the
silent
guest
instead
of
sitting
quietly
upon
the
porch
with
his
cigar
perkins
had
fallen
to
pacing
up
and
down
with
a
long
nervous
stride
at
first
he
had
seemed
moody
and
fatigued
now
he
had
the
appearance
of
a
man
eager
to
be
at
something
from
which
he
was
restrained
when
tom
asked
his
startled
question
about
the
desirable
boom
perkins
got
out
of
his
chair
with
one
abrupt
movement
threw
one
leg
over
the
porch
rail
and
began
suddenly
to
talk
he
could
not
be
said
really
to
have
talked
before
tom
listened
his
eyes
sticking
out
of
his
head
bunch
of
motoring
fellows
down
in
town
mercury
club
want
to
get
up
an

how
perkins
threw
away
the
stub
of
his
cigar
chewed
to
a
pulp
at
the
mouth
end
his
eyes
had
an
odd
glitter
i
what
you
might
call
a
bit
of
experience
in
that
sort
of
thing
he
said
in
a
quiet
tone
which
yet
had
a
certain
edge
of
energy
going
away
next
week
but
might
put
this
thing
through
for
you
if
you
cared
to

for

agreed
tom
his
round
cheeks
deeply
flushed
with
excitement
say
you
you
awfully
kind
i
do
know
why
perkins
vaulted
over
the
porch
rail
from
the
ground
below
he
looked
back
at
tom
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
come
to
boswell
inn
tom
caught
sight
of
the
gleam
of
white
teeth
as
an
oddly
brilliant
smile
broke
out
for
an
instant
on
the
face
which
was
no
longer
deadly
white
but
brown
with
tan
son
said
perkins
preparing
to
swing
away
down
to
the
i
told
you
i
was
a
gambler
gambler
out
of
work
the
lamest
duck
on
the
shore
game
of
booming
the
inn
interests
me
all
tom
watched
the
lithe
slim
figure
in
the
distance
for
a
minute
before
he
went
in
to
break
the
plan
to
the
force
of
boswell
he
no
gambler
said
he
to
himself
or
i
could
trust
him
the
way
i
do
he
queer
but
i
do
believe
he
has
any
other
motive
for
this
than
wanting
to
help
us
with
which
innocent
faith
in
the
goodness
of
the
man
who
had
already
seen
more
of
the
world
than
tom
boswell
would
ever
see
he
rushed
in
to
tell
bertha
and
the
rest
of
his
excited
family
the
astounding
talk
he
had
just
had
with
perkins
mother
boswell
you
got
to
come
out
on
the
porch
just
one
minute
and
look
no
no
child
i
ca
i
not
where
the
folks
are
just
out
on
perkins
balcony
he
told
me
to
take
you
but
i
ca
leave
yes
you
can
everything
all
right
come
quick
the
first
autos
are
coming
you
can
see
miles
off
with
one
glance
about
the
kitchen
where
two
extra
helpers
were
busy
with
the
last
preparations
over
which
boswell
had
kept
a
supervising
eye
to
the
smallest
detail
herself
working
harder
than
anybody
the
mistress
of
the
place
suffered
herself
to
be
led
away
up
the
back
stairs
through
perkins
empty
rooms
out
upon
the
balcony
sue
hustled
her
mother
and
then
with
one
triumphant
there
swept
an
arm
about
the
entire
horizon
my
goodness
burst
from
the
lady
lips
and
she
stood
gazing
transfixed
at
the
foot
of
the
mountainside
where
lay
the
little
village
street
with
its
row
of
shops
and
houses
glowed
a
line
of
chinese
lanterns
hung
thickly
along
the
entire
distance
the
winding
road
up
to
the
inn
was
outlined
by
lanterns
the
trees
about
the
inn
held
out
long
arms
dancing
with
the
lights
the
porch
below
as
could
be
told
by
the
rainbow
tints
thrown
upon
the
ground
beneath
was
hung
with
them
from
end
to
end
my
goodness
came
again
from
boswell
in
stupefied
amazement
there
must
be
a
thousand
of
those
things
how
on
earth
but
her
ear
was
caught
by
a
distant
boom
and
her
eyes
lifted
to
the
surrounding
mountain
heights
in
a
dozen
different
places
bonfires
flashed
and
leaped
with
an
indescribable
effect
of
beauty
they
firing
dynamite
up
on
west
peak
explained
sue
jack
weatherbee
offered
to
do
that
tim
got
boys
at
all
those
places
to
keep
up
the
fires
and
put
out
afterward
oh
look
now
you
can
see
the
parade
beginning
to
show
down
upon
the
distant
plain
across
which
lay
the
winding
road
out
from
the
city
one
could
discern
a
trail
of
light
thrown
by
many
searchlights
and
make
out
its
rapid
advance
the
sight
moved
boswell
instantly
to
action
again
i
must
get
back
to
the
kitchen
she
cried
and
vanished
from
the
balcony
if
you
could
only
see
the
inn
from
outside
sue
called
after
her
but
uselessly
boswell
felt
that
the
entire
success
of
the
boom
depended
upon
the
kitchen
they
might
string
lanterns
from
boswell
to
jericho
but
if
the
supper
should
be
good
the
thought
sent
her
down
the
back
stairs
at
a
speed
reckless
for
one
of
her
years
but
she
reached
the
bottom
safely
or
this
story
would
never
have
been
told
the
first
cars
in
the
procession
came
up
the
steep
road
with
open
the
bigger
cars
made
nothing
of
it
the
smaller
ones
got
into
their
low
gears
and
ground
a
bit
as
they
pulled
in
fifteen
minutes
from
the
first
arrival
the
wide
plateau
upon
which
the
inn
stood
looked
like
an
immense
garage
cars
of
every
description
having
been
packed
in
together
at
all
angles
up
the
inn
steps
flowed
a
steady
stream
of
people
men
in
driving
attire
and
motor
caps
women
in
long
coats
and
floating
veils
under
which
showed
pretty
summer
frocks
a
few
children
dressed
like
their
elders
in
motoring
rig
their
faces
eager
with
interest
in
everything
in
the
hall
behind
a
screen
of
flags
and
evergreen
the
orchestra
played
merrily
it
presently
had
to
play
its
loudest
to
be
heard
above
the
chorus
of
voices
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
every
table
in
the
airy
lit
by
more
chinese
lanterns
and
hung
with
streamers
of
bunting
was
filled
reservations
had
been
made
by
mail
and
telephone
for
the
past
three
days
and
with
a
list
in
his
hand
tom
hurried
about
he
could
never
have
kept
his
head
if
it
had
not
been
for
young
haskins
at
his
elbow
haskins
was
secretary
of
the
mercury
club
and
knew
everybody
he
was
a
genial
fellow
and
if
anybody
attempted
to
tell
tom
that
a
mistake
had
been
made
and
certain
reservations
should
have
been
for
the
first
or
second
table
instead
of
the
third
haskins
would
cut
in
with
a
joke
and
have
the
murmurer
appeased
and
laughing
in
a
trice
as
for
perkins
but
where
was
perkins
up
to
the
last
minute
before
the
first
car
arrived
perkins
had
been
in
evidence
enough
in
fact
he
had
been
everywhere
all
day
personally
supervising
every
detail
working
like
a
fiend
himself
and
inspiring
everybody
else
to
work
proving
himself
the
ablest
of
generals
and
a
perfect
genius
at
effective
decoration
the
inn
inside
and
out
was
a
fairyland
of
light
and
colour
even
the
sated
eyes
of
the
city
people
accustomed
to
every
trick
of
effect
in
such
affairs
were
charmed
with
the
picturesque
quality
of
the
scene
but
now
tom
could
see
nothing
of
perkins
anywhere
tim
hurriedly
questioned
shook
his
head
also
puzzled
late
in
the
evening
there
came
a
moment
when
tom
could
free
himself
long
enough
to
run
up
to
perkins
room
he
was
uneasy
about
his
guest
and
friend
for
that
the
stranger
seemed
to
have
become
perkins
certainly
did
look
quite
strong
could
he
have
overdone
and
be
ill
alone
in
his
room
after
one
hasty
knock
to
which
he
got
no
answer
tom
turned
the
knob
through
the
open
balcony
door
he
saw
a
leg
and
shoulder
and
smelled
the
familiar
fragrance
of
the
special
brand
hello
son
was
perkins
greeting
you
not
sick
never
things
going
o
oh
splendid
such
a
crowd
such
a
jolly
crowd
but
why
do
you
come
down
to
help
make
things
go
no
no
to
enjoy
it
you
done
enough
you
must
know
some
of
these
people
and
if
you
do
it
worth
something
just
to
look
at
i
did
know
ladies
dressed
like
that
under
those
things
they
wear
in
the
autos
say
perkins
the
here
and
his
wife
so
haskins
thinks
they
want
to
stay
all
night
the
lady
has
been
sleeping
well
through
the
heat
haskins
says
she
taken
a
fancy
to
the
inn
but
i
have
a
really
good
room
for
take
mine
tom
gasped
oh
no
not
yours
after
all
you
done
going
you
know
it
does
matter
where
i
hang
up
matters
a
good
deal
where
hangs
up
but
where
anywhere
may
sit
up
till
morning
anyhow
feel
like
it
your
show
sort
of
goes
to
my
head
my
show
yours
but
why
on
earth
do
you
come
down
and
by
and
by
son
say
send
me
some
clean
linen
and
i
see
that
this
room
in
shape
for
the
lady
girls
all
busy
yet
room
swept
yesterday
my
truck
packed
i
have
things
ready
in
ten
minutes
tom
went
downstairs
feeling
more
than
ever
that
his
guest
was
an
enigma
but
he
was
too
busy
to
stop
just
then
to
think
about
it
the
hours
went
by
the
guests
talked
and
laughed
ate
and
promenaded
they
crowded
the
porch
to
watch
the
fireworks
on
the
mountain
they
swept
over
the
smooth
space
and
the
roadway
in
front
of
the
inn
looking
up
at
it
and
remarking
upon
the
quaint
charm
of
it
the
desirability
of
its
location
its
attractiveness
as
a
resort
tom
heard
one
pretty
girl
planning
a
luncheon
here
next
week
he
heard
a
group
of
men
talking
about
entertaining
a
visiting
delegation
of
bankers
up
here
at
out
of
the
heat
everywhere
people
were
asking
why
have
we
known
about
this
and
to
one
and
another
arthur
haskins
in
tom
hearing
was
saying
such
things
as
just
opened
up
jolly
place
is
it
going
to
be
the
most
popular
anywhere
around
deserves
it
too
but
is
the
table
as
good
every
day
as
it
is
one
skeptic
inquired
better
haskins
might
have
been
an
owner
of
the
place
he
was
so
prompt
with
his
flattering
statements
first
time
i
came
up
was
with
a
crowd
of
fellows
we
took
them
unawares
and
they
served
a
supper
that
made
us
smile
all
over
their
cook
ca
be
beaten
and
the
service
is
it
was
over
at
last
but
it
was
at
a
late
hour
that
the
first
cars
began
to
roll
away
down
the
hill
and
later
still
when
the
last
got
under
way
they
carried
a
gay
company
and
the
final
rockets
spurting
from
west
peak
flashed
before
the
faces
of
people
in
the
high
good
humour
of
those
who
have
been
successfully
and
uniquely
entertained
the
and
his
wife
had
gone
to
the
pink
and
white
welcome
of
the
bridal
suite
when
perkins
at
last
came
strolling
downstairs
only
haskins
party
remained
in
the
lobby
the
women
sheathing
themselves
in
veils
as
their
motor
chugged
at
the
porch
steps
haskins
turned
as
perkins
crossed
the
lobby
he
stared
an
instant
then
advanced
with
outstretched
hand
smiling
why
parker
he
said
i
did
know
you
were
here
doctor
austin
was
asking
me
if
i
knew
where
you
were
he
seems
to
have
got
you
on
his
mind
he
be
delighted
to
see
you
i
call
him
he
just
outside
he
with
our
party
with
an
expression
half
dismayed
half
amused
perkins
looked
after
the
mercury
club
secretary
as
he
darted
to
the
outer
door
where
a
big
figure
in
a
motoring
coat
was
pacing
up
and
down
tom
leaning
over
the
office
desk
looked
at
perkins
but
haskins
had
called
the
man
parker
what
the
big
figure
in
the
motoring
coat
came
hurriedly
in
at
the
doorway
and
grasped
the
hand
of
tom
guest
parker
he
cried
what
are
you
doing
here
are
you
responsible
for
this
panjandrum
did
i
send
you
off
for
an
absolute
rest
been
obeying
directions
strictly
doctor
i
lain
around
up
here
till
the
grass
sprouted
under
my
feet
you
have
seen
me
here
have
you
no
but
the
thing
looks
like
one
of
your
managing
no
interest
in
this
place
whatever
never
heard
of
it
till
i
stumbled
on
it
but
perkins
eyes
were
dancing
you
looking
a
lot
better
anyhow
come
out
here
and
meet
austin
i
want
to
show
her
the
toughest
patient
i
ever
had
to
pull
loose
from
his
work
the
two
went
out
upon
the
porch
tom
gazed
at
young
haskins
as
the
latter
looked
at
him
with
a
smile
did
he
engineer
this
part
of
the
thing
too
boswell
questioned
the
young
man
interestedly
sure
he
did
but
who
is
he
did
you
know
who
he
was
that
so
you
called
him
perkins
all
along
but
this
is
the
first
time
i
seen
him
here
and
i
did
put
two
and
two
together
his
letters
and
about
this
supper
came
from
in
town
somewhere
why
he
chris
parker
the
biggest
hotel
man
in
the
country
nobody
like
him
he
make
the
deadest
hotel
in
the
loneliest
hamlet
pay
in
a
month
head
of
all
the
hotel
organizations
you
can
count
most
original
chap
in
the
world
doctor
austin
was
telling
me
about
ordering
him
off
for
a
rest
because
he
put
such
a
lot
of
nerve
tension
into
his
schemes
he
was
on
the
edge
of
a
bad
breakdown
well
well
you
mighty
lucky
if
you
got
him
backing
you
no
other
man
on
earth
could
have
got
the
mercury
club
up
here
a
place
they
never
heard
of
so
tom
was
thinking
he
was
still
thinking
it
when
the
motor
car
shot
away
down
the
hill
with
its
load
the
physician
calling
back
at
his
do
get
going
too
soon
again
parker
so
far
so
good
but
do
the
last
words
were
lost
in
a
final
boom
from
west
peak
tom
went
slowly
out
upon
the
porch
feeling
embarrassed
and
uncertain
how
could
he
ever
express
his
gratitude
to
this
mighty
man
of
valour
perkins
was
sitting
as
usual
astride
the
porch
rail
the
red
light
of
his
cigar
glowing
against
the
dark
background
of
the
mountains
where
the
bonfires
were
dying
to
mere
sparks
he
looked
around
as
tom
appeared
and
grinned
in
a
friendly
way
under
the
chinese
lanterns
tough
luck
to
get
caught
at
the
last
minute
eh
he
said
mr
per
parker
began
tom
and
stopped
the
biggest
hotel
man
in
the
country
looked
at
the
greenest
young
innkeeper
and
there
was
satisfaction
in
his
bright
black
eyes
not
any
thanks
son
should
have
croaked
in
one
week
more
if
i
have
worked
off
a
few
pounds
of
high
pressure
this
sort
of
thing
to
me
like
a
game
to
a
gambler
as
i
told
you
had
to
keep
or
have
had
a
dozen
parties
from
town
after
me
on
one
deal
or
another
thought
i
could
put
this
little
stunt
through
without
giving
myself
away
but
came
downstairs
five
minutes
too
soon
went
off
pretty
well
eh
you
have
patronage
after
this
all
right
no
no
thanks
i
said
i
under
obligations
to
you
for
trusting
me
to
run
the
thing
it
saved
my
life
well
if
it
were
all
a
game
tom
thought
as
he
watched
christopher
parker
run
lightly
up
the
stairs
a
few
minutes
later
it
was
certainly
a
wondrous
friendly
one
boswell
inn
was
now
known
to
be
only
sixteen
short
motor
miles
from
ii
honour
and
the
girl
he
lay
back
among
the
crimson
pillows
in
his
big
chair
close
beside
the
fire
with
his
eyes
on
the
burning
logs
a
tablet
and
pen
lay
in
his
lap
and
he
had
written
a
few
paragraphs
but
he
was
listening
now
to
certain
sounds
which
came
from
below
stairs
voices
laughter
scurryings
up
and
down
the
hall
and
staircase
then
the
slam
of
a
heavy
door
the
tuneful
ring
of
sleighbells
in
a
rapid
down
the
street
and
absolute
silence
within
the
house
three
times
in
the
last
fifteen
minutes
before
the
door
closed
somebody
had
looked
in
upon
the
occupant
of
the
big
chair
to
say
something
like
this
oh
jerry
sorry
we
could
spend
nan
last
evening
with
you
too
bad
this
wretched
van
antwerp
dance
had
to
come
christmas
eve
too
busy
are
you
as
usual
at
work
on
those
sketches
of
country
life
in
winter
you
clever
boy
who
but
you
could
make
so
much
out
of
so
little
anything
we
can
do
for
you
before
we
are
off
nan
hates
to
go
since
it
the
very
last
evening
of
her
visit
she
thought
we
all
ought
to
give
up
and
stay
with
you
but
we
told
her
you
disliked
to
be
well
old
fellow
do
write
too
late
you
know
the
doctor
thinks
plenty
of
sleep
is
part
of
your
cure
that
was
the
sort
of
thing
they
had
been
saying
to
him
for
a
year
now
a
year
and
he
seemed
no
nearer
health
than
when
he
had
been
sent
home
from
his
gloriously
busy
abounding
life
in
new
york
where
he
was
succeeding
brilliantly
far
beyond
anybody
expectations
except
those
of
the
few
knowing
ones
who
had
recognized
the
genius
in
him
in
his
school
and
college
days
but
he
had
never
given
up
invalided
in
body
his
mind
worked
unceasingly
and
a
certain
part
of
the
literary
work
he
had
been
doing
he
did
still
he
said
it
kept
him
from
going
off
his
head
when
the
stillness
of
the
usually
noisy
house
had
become
oppressive
he
took
up
his
tablet
and
pen
again
he
wrote
a
sentence
or
two
slowly
then
another
more
slowly
and
drew
an
impatient
line
through
them
all
he
tossed
the
tablet
over
to
a
table
near
at
hand
and
sat
staring
into
the
fire
certain
lines
about
his
mouth
grew
deep
a
knock
on
his
door
roused
him
and
he
realized
that
it
had
sounded
before
come
in
he
called
and
the
door
opened
and
closed
behind
him
an
unmistakable
sound
as
of
the
soft
rustle
of
delicate
skirts
swept
across
the
floor
and
paused
behind
his
chair
he
drew
himself
up
among
his
pillows
and
strained
his
neck
to
look
over
his
shoulder
a
young
face
full
of
life
and
colour
laughed
down
into
his
you
he
said
in
an
amazed
breath
why
nan
he
reached
up
one
hand
and
took
hers
and
drew
her
with
his
slight
strength
around
where
he
could
see
her
it
did
not
take
much
strength
she
came
laughing
still
and
sweeping
a
graceful
low
bend
before
him
do
ask
me
why
she
said
with
a
shake
of
her
head
i
did
want
to
go
i
knew
i
would
go
all
the
time
i
was
dressing
but
i
dressed
i
knew
i
could
argue
with
them
better
when
i
got
this
gown
on
i
think
i
have
rather
a
regal
air
in
it
do
you
i
could
tell
better
if
you
were
not
wearing
that
shapeless
thing
over
it
oh
but
i
taken
off
my
gloves
and
i
ca
stand
bare
arms
and
shoulders
here
at
home
she
shrugged
the
shoulders
under
the
thin
silken
garment
with
which
she
had
covered
them
and
you
not
going
to
the
van
antwerps
at
all
certainly
not
i
preferred
to
stay
at
home
why
i
told
you
not
to
ask
me
why
but
i
suppose
you
wo
talk
about
anything
else
until
you
know
she
sat
down
opposite
him
before
the
fire
looking
up
at
the
great
branches
of
holly
on
the
above
their
scarlet
berries
gleaming
saucily
among
the
rich
green
of
their
leaves
she
reached
up
and
pulled
off
a
spray
then
she
glanced
at
him
he
was
silently
surveying
her
in
her
delicate
blue
gauzy
gown
she
was
something
to
look
at
in
the
i
wanted
to
spend
my
last
evening
here
with
you
she
said
he
smiled
back
at
her
three
people
looked
in
here
this
evening
and
told
me
you
thought
you
ought
she
answered
indignantly
i
did
say
i
ought
i
did
think
it
i
wanted
to
and
i
did
want
them
to
stay
that
is
why
i
let
them
all
array
themselves
before
i
refused
to
go
he
was
still
smiling
delicate
flattery
he
said
adapted
to
an
invalid
you
should
never
let
an
invalid
think
you
pity
him
at
least
not
a
who
got
knocked
out
while
playing
a
vigorous
game
for
all
it
was
worth
jerry
she
said
looking
full
at
him
out
of
a
pair
of
eyes
which
were
capable
of
saying
eloquent
things
quite
by
themselves
do
you
think
all
the
hours
i
spent
with
you
in
this
month
i
been
visiting
hester
were
spent
from
pity
i
hope
not
he
answered
lightly
i
sure
not
we
had
some
pleasant
times
have
we
she
turned
from
him
without
speaking
and
clasping
her
hands
loosely
in
front
of
her
bent
forward
and
studied
the
fire
presently
she
got
up
and
took
a
fresh
log
from
the
basket
be
careful
he
warned
as
she
stooped
to
lay
it
in
place
put
it
on
gently
the
sparks
might
fly
and
that
cobweb
dress
of
yours
she
laid
the
log
across
the
other
sticks
and
started
back
with
a
little
cry
as
a
dozen
brilliant
points
of
flame
flew
toward
her
do
do
that
again
he
protested
sternly
with
nothing
of
the
invalid
in
his
voice
i
do
like
to
see
you
do
such
things
when
i
stir
to
save
you
no
matter
what
happened
she
stood
looking
down
at
him
jerry
she
said
i
tell
you
why
i
stayed
i
wanted
to
talk
with
you
about
something
i
want
your
help
his
eyes
told
her
that
he
would
give
it
if
he
could
do
you
mind
if
i
sit
on
a
pillow
here
before
the
fire
she
asked
bringing
one
from
the
couch
jerry
had
plenty
of
pillows
since
his
breakdown
every
girl
who
had
ever
known
him
had
sent
him
a
fresh
one
somehow
i
can
talk
better
she
explained
she
settled
herself
on
her
cushion
her
blue
skirts
lying
in
light
folds
about
her
her
chin
on
her
hand
her
elbow
on
her
knee
i
always
go
straight
to
the
point
she
said
i
never
know
how
to
lead
artfully
up
to
a
thing
jerry
you
know
i
go
to
paris
in
january
to
do
some
special
work
in
illustrating
yes
i
go
with
aunt
elizabeth
and
we
shall
live
very
quietly
and
properly
and
i
shall
not
have
any
of
the
trials
so
many
young
women
workers
have
my
work
will
keep
me
very
busy
and
i
think
happy
i
mean
it
shall
but
jerry
i
want
something
you
know
you
have
always
known
me
because
i
was
hester
friend
is
this
to
the
point
he
asked
and
there
was
a
gleam
of
fun
in
his
eyes
though
his
lips
were
sober
but
his
interest
was
unmistakable
very
straight
but
we
have
never
been
special
friends
you
and
i
have
we
i
congratulated
myself
we
had
not
what
i
mean
by
that
word
she
sat
looking
into
the
fire
for
some
little
time
while
he
remained
motionless
watching
her
his
eyes
shaded
by
his
hand
at
length
she
said
very
earnestly
still
staring
fireward
while
her
cheeks
took
on
a
slight
access
of
colour
i
want
to
feel
i
have
a
friend
one
friend
a
real
one
whom
i
leave
behind
me
here
who
will
understand
me
and
write
to
me
and
whom
i
can
count
on
differently
from
the
way
i
count
on
other
friends
he
was
studying
her
absorbedly
there
came
into
his
eyes
a
peculiar
look
as
she
made
her
frank
statement
then
you
have
just
that
sort
of
a
friend
among
all
the
men
you
know
at
home
not
a
single
one
and
i
miss
it
not
because
i
have
ever
had
it
she
added
quickly
he
was
silent
for
a
little
while
then
he
said
very
quietly
you
are
offering
me
a
good
deal
nan
do
you
realize
just
how
much
friendship
such
friendship
means
more
to
me
now
than
it
ever
did
before
does
it
she
asked
with
equal
quietness
i
glad
of
that
because
he
went
on
gravely
i
realize
that
it
is
the
only
thing
i
can
ever
have
and
it
must
take
the
place
of
all
i
once
hoped
for
oh
why
do
you
say
that
she
cried
impetuously
since
you
are
to
be
my
friend
now
my
special
friend
i
can
tell
you
what
doctor
mcdonough
told
me
just
two
days
ago
may
i
tell
you
that
i
have
told
and
shall
tell
no
one
else
before
you
take
the
vows
he
smiled
grimly
you
should
know
what
you
are
accepting
tell
me
he
said
i
might
be
better
much
better
but
i
could
never
hope
to
be
my
old
self
again
oh
jerry
oh
jerry
her
voice
was
almost
a
sob
she
turned
about
and
reached
up
both
hands
to
him
clasping
his
with
a
warm
and
tender
pressure
is
that
what
your
friendship
means
he
asked
holding
her
hands
closely
and
looking
down
steadily
into
her
eyes
while
his
own
grew
brilliant
if
it
does
it
is
going
to
be
something
a
man
might
give
up
a
good
deal
for
oh
how
can
you
take
such
a
cruel
disappointment
so
she
breathed
and
to
hear
it
just
at
christmas
too
i
said
all
along
that
you
were
just
the
bravest
person
i
ever
knew
but
now
jerry
i
not
worthy
to
be
your
friend
ah
i
not
let
you
take
back
what
you
offered
me
if
you
knew
how
i
wanted
to
ask
it
have
you
really
she
asked
so
eagerly
that
he
turned
his
head
away
for
a
moment
and
set
his
lips
firmly
together
as
if
he
feared
he
might
presently
be
tempted
to
go
beyond
those
strait
boundaries
of
friendship
somehow
from
the
lips
of
such
a
girl
as
nan
this
sort
of
thing
was
the
most
appealing
flattery
at
the
same
time
it
was
unquestionably
sincere
so
you
will
seal
the
compact
think
it
over
carefully
i
can
never
give
you
the
strong
arm
a
well
man
could
if
you
will
teach
me
to
acquire
the
sort
of
strength
you
have
learned
yourself
she
said
and
there
was
a
hint
of
mistiness
about
those
eyes
of
hers
you
will
have
given
me
something
worth
while
presently
they
were
talking
of
her
journey
to
be
begun
on
the
morrow
of
her
work
in
which
she
had
come
in
the
last
year
to
remarkable
success
of
his
work
the
part
which
he
could
do
and
would
continue
to
do
he
said
with
added
vigour
they
talked
quietly
but
earnestly
and
each
time
she
looked
up
into
his
face
she
saw
there
a
new
brightness
something
beyond
the
mere
patient
acceptance
of
his
hard
trial
jerry
she
said
all
at
once
breaking
off
in
the
midst
of
a
discussion
of
certain
phases
of
the
illustrator
art
you
do
know
how
suddenly
rich
i
feel
all
the
while
you
were
doing
such
wonderful
beautiful
things
with
your
pen
in
new
york
and
being
made
so
much
of
i
was
thinking
an
inspiration
jerrold
fullerton
would
be
as
a
real
friend
but
all
the
girls
were
he
laughed
they
wo
trouble
you
now
but
your
friendship
is
worth
more
now
than
then
he
shook
his
head
it
is
because
are
more
than
you
were
then
i
a
mere
wreck
of
what
i
was
nan
he
did
not
say
it
bitterly
but
he
could
not
quite
keep
the
sadness
out
of
the
uncompromising
phrase
she
looked
up
at
him
studying
his
face
intently
it
had
always
been
a
remarkably
fine
face
and
on
it
the
suffering
of
the
past
year
had
done
a
certain
work
which
added
to
its
beauty
he
did
not
look
ill
but
the
refinement
which
illness
sometimes
lends
to
faces
of
a
somewhat
too
strongly
cut
type
had
softened
it
into
an
exceeding
charm
out
of
it
the
eyes
shone
with
an
undaunted
spirit
which
told
of
hidden
fires
i
am
glad
a
share
in
the
wreckage
falls
to
me
she
said
softly
nan
he
told
her
while
his
lips
broke
irresistibly
into
a
smile
again
i
believe
you
are
deliberately
trying
to
burn
a
sweet
incense
before
me
just
how
fragrant
it
is
to
a
fellow
in
my
shape
i
ca
tell
you
you
would
never
do
it
if
i
were
on
my
feet
i
appreciate
that
but
i
very
grateful
just
the
same
i
like
she
said
with
eyes
which
fell
now
to
the
hands
folded
in
her
lap
and
the
droop
of
her
head
as
he
saw
it
with
the
profile
cut
like
an
exquisite
silhouette
against
the
fire
was
burnt
into
his
memory
afterward
to
have
you
remember
this
christmas
eve
as
i
shall
remember
it
shall
you
shall
i
ah
who
is
deliberately
trying
to
say
nice
things
now
but
she
said
it
rather
faintly
he
lay
back
among
his
pillows
with
a
long
breath
so
you
go
morning
early
at
six
you
will
not
see
me
and
i
must
go
now
see
it
is
after
eleven
think
of
their
making
me
go
out
this
evening
when
i
must
be
up
at
five
and
travel
the
next
hours
on
christmas
day
too
is
that
too
bad
but
that
the
price
of
my
staying
over
to
spend
christmas
eve
with
jerry
fullerton
like
the
foolish
girl
that
i
am
she
rose
and
stood
before
him
would
you
mind
slipping
off
that
domino
he
requested
i
like
to
see
you
just
as
all
the
other
fellows
would
have
seen
you
if
you
had
gone
to
the
van
antwerps
smiling
and
flushing
a
little
she
drew
off
the
silken
garment
and
the
firelight
bathed
her
softly
rounded
shoulders
and
arms
in
a
rosy
glow
he
looked
at
her
silently
for
a
minute
until
she
said
again
that
she
must
go
and
took
a
step
toward
him
smiling
down
at
him
and
holding
out
both
hands
i
do
know
how
i
can
spare
my
friend
when
i
just
found
her
he
said
searching
her
face
with
an
intentness
she
found
it
difficult
to
bear
i
suppose
i
ought
not
to
ask
it
but
it
christmas
eve
you
know
and
you
give
me
one
more
thing
to
remember
wo
you
nan
she
bent
like
a
child
and
laid
her
lips
lightly
upon
his
forehead
but
he
caught
her
hands
is
that
the
proper
degree
for
friendship
and
you
feel
that
more
would
be
too
much
she
hesitated
then
as
his
grasp
drew
her
she
stooped
lower
blushing
beautifully
to
give
the
kiss
upon
his
lips
but
it
was
not
the
breath
of
a
caress
she
would
have
made
it
invalids
are
sometimes
possessed
of
unsuspected
reserves
of
strength
she
turned
away
then
in
a
pretty
confusion
said
and
went
slowly
toward
the
door
oh
come
back
he
cried
tell
me
you
will
write
often
oh
yes
every
month
month
wo
you
write
every
mail
oh
jerry
every
week
then
will
you
i
will
whether
you
do
or
not
your
ideas
of
friendship
are
they
too
exacting
she
admitted
as
if
reluctantly
she
was
behind
him
now
her
hands
clasped
together
tightly
her
eyes
glowing
with
the
light
of
a
frightened
purpose
which
was
her
he
tried
to
turn
and
see
her
but
she
defeated
this
please
come
here
he
begged
she
was
silent
trying
to
breathe
more
naturally
please
what
good
will
it
do
she
asked
at
last
i
shall
have
to
go
and
you
wo
wo
what
she
crept
up
close
behind
his
she
whispered
he
reached
out
his
hand
with
a
commanding
gesture
nan
come
here
say
what
she
bent
over
the
back
of
his
chair
and
laid
a
soft
trembling
hand
on
each
side
of
his
face
please
say
it
she
breathed
he
seized
her
hands
and
drew
them
to
his
lips
nan
you
are
tempting
me
almost
beyond
my
power
do
you
mean
to
tempt
me
are
you
trying
to
she
leaned
low
so
that
her
breath
swept
his
cheek
and
whispered
yes
oh
my
god
he
groaned
nan
are
you
insane
what
if
i
say
it
then
how
much
worse
will
it
be
i
can
bear
it
better
as
it
is
now
and
you
ca
mean
it
it
came
the
breath
in
his
ear
again
he
was
silent
for
a
while
breathing
heavily
presently
he
began
to
speak
in
a
quiet
tone
whose
vibrations
showed
nevertheless
the
most
rigid
he
still
held
her
hands
resting
there
upon
his
shoulders
but
he
made
no
further
effort
to
see
her
face
nan
he
said
this
friendship
you
give
me
is
the
dearest
thing
i
ever
knew
it
is
worth
everything
to
me
let
me
keep
it
while
you
go
away
for
your
year
of
work
be
the
warmest
friend
to
me
you
know
how
and
write
me
everything
about
yourself
meanwhile
keep
your
heart
free
for
the
man
will
surely
come
to
claim
it
some
day
a
man
who
will
be
worthy
of
you
in
every
way
soul
mind
and
body
i
shall
be
happy
in
your
her
hand
pulled
itself
away
from
his
and
was
laid
with
a
gentle
insistence
upon
his
mouth
jerry
she
said
very
softly
that
enough
please
i
understand
that
had
to
be
said
i
knew
you
would
say
it
it
what
you
think
you
ought
to
say
of
course
but
it
said
now
you
need
repeat
it
for
it
not
the
thing
i
waiting
for
you
to
say
nan
would
you
make
a
poor
girl
do
it
all
she
questioned
with
a
suggestion
of
both
laughter
and
tears
in
her
voice
but
nan
i
not
used
to
it
she
urged
it
very
embarrassing
and
i
ought
to
be
asleep
this
minute
getting
ready
for
my
early
start
i
not
quite
sure
that
i
shall
sleep
if
you
say
it
her
voice
dropped
to
a
whisper
again
but
i
sure
i
shall
not
if
you
do
my
dear
girl
that
hardly
warm
enough
is
it
under
the
circumstances
when
you
wo
see
me
for
a
year
jerry
a
whole
year
nan
for
the
love
of
heaven
come
around
here
not
so
much
for
the
love
of
heaven
as
no
for
the
love
of
you
you
she
came
at
last
and
then
she
saw
his
eyes
but
she
could
not
meet
them
after
the
first
glance
she
lay
in
his
arms
held
there
by
a
grasp
so
strong
that
it
astonished
her
beyond
measure
so
for
a
time
then
he
began
to
speak
in
her
ear
now
where
in
its
pinkness
with
a
little
brown
curl
touching
his
lips
it
listened
you
made
me
say
it
dear
when
for
your
sake
i
would
have
kept
it
back
but
you
know
you
must
know
nothing
can
come
of
it
he
heard
her
murmur
why
you
know
why
i
do
he
drew
a
deep
breath
do
you
want
me
she
asked
into
his
shoulder
want
you
you
everything
to
offer
me
nan
everything
i
want
jerry
she
lifted
her
head
and
looked
for
an
instant
into
his
eyes
i
shall
die
of
heartache
if
you
wo
offer
it
a
wreck
of
a
life
i
wo
let
you
call
it
that
again
she
flashed
you
jerrold
fullerton
whose
merest
scrawl
is
reviewed
by
every
literary
editor
in
the
land
do
you
think
you
ca
do
still
better
work
with
with
me
but
you
would
be
marrying
jerrold
fullerton
mind
alone
no
his
soul
all
there
is
of
him
his
great
personality
himself
and
that
so
much
more
than
i
can
give
in
return
nan
darling
yes
go
to
paris
for
a
year
but
do
bind
yourself
to
me
then
when
you
come
back
if
if
i
still
of
the
same
mind
jerry
you
sound
like
the
counsel
of
a
wise
and
worldly
grandmother
with
a
gleeful
if
i
no
worse
if
i
a
little
better
this
is
great
medicine
nan
i
feel
like
a
new
man
now
if
then
i
shall
not
go
at
all
unless
unless
yes
unless
i
am
bound
tight
tight
to
you
i
i
should
feel
sure
of
you
oh
there
no
use
resisting
you
he
said
half
under
his
breath
it
the
sorriest
bargain
a
woman
ever
made
but
if
she
will
make
it
look
at
me
nan
i
ca
long
she
complained
somehow
you
you
blind
me
he
laughed
softly
i
realize
that
you
are
blind
blind
but
i
open
your
eyes
somehow
i
losing
the
strength
to
try
i
must
go
now
she
said
gently
trying
to
release
herself
really
i
must
yes
i
must
please
jerry
let
me
go
dear
yes
yes
you
must
it
took
time
however
and
was
accomplished
with
extreme
difficulty
but
i
go
now
i
could
when
i
said
before
oh
it
striking
twelve
jerry
merry
christmas
jerry
before
she
quite
went
however
she
came
back
once
more
to
lean
over
the
back
of
his
chair
and
whisper
in
his
ear
jerry
yes
am
i
really
engaged
to
you
darling
bless
you
i
afraid
you
are
afraid
nan
i
the
happiest
cripple
on
earth
so
she
went
softly
out
and
closed
the
door
but
it
was
not
to
sleep
as
for
the
man
she
left
behind
his
eyes
looked
into
the
smouldering
fire
till
well
toward
morning
it
was
not
the
doctor
prescription
but
it
was
the
beginning
of
his
cure
iii
their
word
of
honour
the
president
of
the
great
b
railway
system
laid
down
the
letter
he
had
just
three
times
and
turned
about
in
his
chair
with
an
expression
of
annoyance
i
wish
it
were
possible
he
said
slowly
to
find
one
boy
or
man
in
a
thousand
who
would
receive
instructions
and
carry
them
out
to
the
letter
without
a
single
variation
from
the
course
laid
down
cornelius
he
looked
up
sharply
at
his
son
who
sat
at
a
desk
close
by
i
hope
you
are
carrying
out
my
ideas
with
regard
to
your
sons
i
not
seen
much
of
them
lately
the
lad
cyrus
seems
to
me
a
promising
fellow
but
not
so
sure
of
cornelius
he
appears
to
be
acquiring
a
sense
of
his
own
importance
as
cornelius
woodbridge
which
is
not
desirable
sir
not
desirable
by
the
way
cornelius
have
you
yet
applied
the
hezekiah
woodbridge
test
to
your
boys
cornelius
woodbridge
junior
looked
up
from
his
work
with
a
smile
no
i
have
father
he
said
it
a
family
tradition
and
if
the
proper
care
has
been
taken
that
the
boys
should
not
learn
of
it
it
will
be
as
much
of
a
test
for
them
as
it
was
for
you
and
for
me
and
for
my
father
you
have
not
forgotten
the
day
i
gave
it
to
you
cornelius
that
would
be
impossible
said
his
son
still
smiling
the
elder
man
somewhat
stern
features
relaxed
and
he
sat
back
in
his
chair
with
a
chuckle
do
it
at
once
he
requested
and
make
it
a
stiff
one
you
know
their
characteristics
give
it
to
them
hard
i
feel
pretty
sure
of
cyrus
but
cornelius
he
shook
his
head
doubtfully
and
returned
to
his
letter
suddenly
he
wheeled
about
again
do
it
thursday
cornelius
he
said
in
his
peremptory
way
and
whichever
one
of
them
stands
it
shall
go
with
us
on
the
tour
of
inspection
that
will
be
reward
enough
i
fancy
very
well
sir
replied
his
son
and
the
two
men
went
on
with
their
work
without
further
words
they
were
in
the
habit
of
dispatching
important
business
with
the
smallest
possible
waste
of
breath
on
thursday
morning
immediately
after
breakfast
cyrus
woodbridge
found
himself
summoned
to
his
father
library
he
presented
himself
at
once
a
lad
of
fifteen
with
an
air
of
alertness
in
every
line
of
him
cyrus
said
his
father
i
have
a
commission
for
you
to
undertake
of
a
character
which
i
can
not
now
explain
to
you
i
want
you
to
take
this
envelope
he
held
out
a
large
and
bulky
packet
and
without
saying
anything
to
any
one
follow
its
instructions
to
the
letter
i
ask
of
you
your
word
of
honour
that
you
will
do
so
the
two
pairs
of
eyes
looked
into
each
other
for
a
moment
singularly
alike
in
a
certain
intent
expression
developed
into
great
keenness
in
the
man
but
showing
as
yet
only
an
extreme
in
the
boy
cyrus
woodbridge
had
an
engagement
with
a
young
friend
in
half
an
hour
but
he
responded
firmly
i
will
sir
on
your
honour
yes
sir
that
is
all
i
want
go
to
your
room
and
read
your
instructions
then
start
at
once
woodbridge
turned
back
to
his
desk
with
the
nod
and
smile
of
dismissal
to
which
cyrus
was
accustomed
the
boy
went
to
his
room
opening
the
envelope
as
soon
as
he
had
closed
the
door
it
was
filled
with
smaller
envelopes
numbered
in
regular
order
enfolding
these
was
a
typewritten
paper
which
read
as
follows
go
to
the
of
the
westchester
library
there
open
env
no
remember
to
hold
all
instructions
secret
cyrus
whistled
that
funny
he
thought
and
it
means
my
date
with
harold
is
off
well
here
goes
on
his
way
out
he
stopped
to
telephone
his
friend
of
his
detention
took
a
westchester
avenue
car
at
the
nearest
point
and
in
twenty
minutes
was
at
the
library
he
found
an
obscure
corner
and
opened
env
no
go
to
office
of
newton
room
seventh
floor
norwalk
building
x
street
reaching
there
by
ask
for
letter
addressed
to
cornelius
woodbridge
on
way
down
elevator
open
env
no
cyrus
began
to
laugh
at
the
same
time
he
felt
a
trifle
irritated
what
father
at
he
questioned
in
perplexity
here
i
am
away
uptown
and
he
orders
me
back
to
the
norwalk
building
i
passed
it
on
my
way
up
must
be
he
made
a
mistake
told
me
to
obey
instructions
though
he
usually
knows
just
about
why
he
does
things
meanwhile
woodbridge
had
sent
for
his
elder
son
cornelius
a
tall
youth
of
seventeen
with
the
strong
family
features
varied
by
a
droop
in
the
eyelids
and
a
slight
drawl
in
the
speech
lounged
to
the
door
of
the
library
before
entering
he
straightened
his
shoulders
he
did
not
however
quicken
his
pace
cornelius
said
his
father
promptly
i
wish
to
send
you
upon
an
errand
of
some
importance
but
of
possible
inconvenience
to
you
i
have
not
time
to
give
you
instructions
but
you
will
find
them
in
this
envelope
i
ask
you
to
keep
the
matter
and
your
movements
strictly
to
yourself
may
i
have
from
you
your
word
of
honour
that
i
can
trust
you
to
follow
the
orders
to
the
smallest
detail
cornelius
put
on
a
pair
of
eyeglasses
and
held
out
his
hand
for
the
envelope
his
manner
was
nonchalant
to
the
point
of
indifference
woodbridge
withheld
the
packet
and
spoke
with
decision
i
can
not
allow
you
to
look
at
the
instructions
until
i
have
your
word
of
honour
that
you
will
fulfil
them
is
that
asking
a
good
deal
sir
perhaps
so
said
woodbridge
but
no
more
than
is
asked
of
trusted
messengers
every
day
i
will
assure
you
that
the
instructions
are
mine
and
represent
my
wishes
how
long
will
it
take
inquired
cornelius
stooping
to
flick
an
imperceptible
spot
of
dust
from
his
trousers
i
do
not
find
it
necessary
to
tell
you
something
in
his
voice
sent
the
languid
cornelius
to
an
erect
position
and
quickened
his
speech
of
course
i
will
go
he
said
but
he
did
not
speak
with
enthusiasm
and
your
word
of
honour
certainly
sir
the
hesitation
before
the
promise
was
momentary
very
well
i
will
trust
you
go
to
your
room
before
opening
your
instructions
and
the
second
somewhat
mystified
boy
went
out
of
the
library
on
that
memorable
thursday
morning
to
find
his
first
order
one
which
sent
him
to
a
remote
district
of
the
city
with
the
direction
to
arrive
there
within
three
quarters
of
an
hour
out
on
an
electric
car
cyrus
was
speeding
to
another
suburb
after
getting
the
letter
from
the
seventh
floor
of
the
norwalk
building
he
had
read
take
car
on
l
street
transfer
to
louisville
avenue
and
go
out
to
kingston
heights
find
corner
west
and
dwight
streets
and
open
env
no
cyrus
was
growing
more
and
more
puzzled
but
he
was
also
getting
interested
at
the
corner
specified
he
hurriedly
tore
open
no
but
found
to
his
amazement
only
the
singular
direction
take
suburban
elevated
road
for
duane
street
station
from
there
go
to
office
and
secure
third
edition
of
paper
open
env
no
well
what
under
the
sun
moon
and
stars
did
he
send
me
out
to
kingston
heights
for
cried
cyrus
aloud
he
caught
the
next
train
thinking
longingly
of
his
broken
engagement
with
harold
dunning
and
of
certain
plans
for
the
afternoon
which
he
was
beginning
to
fear
might
be
thwarted
if
this
seemingly
endless
and
aimless
excursion
continued
he
looked
at
the
packet
of
unopened
envelopes
it
would
be
mighty
easy
to
break
open
the
whole
outfit
and
see
what
this
game
is
he
thought
never
knew
father
to
do
a
thing
like
this
before
if
it
a
joke
his
fingers
felt
the
seal
of
env
no
i
might
as
well
find
it
out
at
once
still
father
never
would
joke
with
a
fellow
promise
the
way
he
asked
it
of
me
word
of
honour
putting
it
pretty
strong
i
see
it
through
of
course
my
but
getting
hungry
it
must
be
near
it
was
not
but
by
the
time
cyrus
had
been
ordered
twice
across
the
city
and
once
up
a
building
in
which
the
elevator
was
out
of
order
it
was
past
noon
and
he
was
in
a
condition
to
find
env
no
a
very
satisfactory
one
go
to
café
reynard
on
westchester
square
take
seat
at
table
in
left
alcove
ask
waiter
for
card
of
cornelius
woodbridge
before
ordering
luncheon
read
env
no
jr
the
boy
lost
no
time
in
obeying
this
command
and
sank
into
his
chair
in
the
designated
alcove
with
a
sigh
of
relief
he
mopped
his
brow
and
drank
off
a
glass
of
ice
water
at
a
gulp
it
was
a
warm
october
day
and
the
sixteen
flights
had
been
somewhat
trying
he
asked
for
his
card
and
then
sat
studying
the
attractive
menu
the
café
reynard
was
a
place
famous
the
country
over
for
its
cookery
i
think
i
have
he
mused
for
a
moment
then
said
helplessly
with
a
laugh
well
i
about
hungry
enough
to
eat
the
whole
thing
bring
me
the
then
he
recollected
paused
and
reluctantly
pulled
out
env
no
and
broke
the
seal
just
a
minute
he
murmured
to
the
waiter
then
his
face
turned
scarlet
and
he
stammered
under
his
breath
why
why
this
ca
be
env
no
ought
to
have
been
bordered
with
black
judging
by
the
dismay
it
caused
the
famished
lad
it
read
remorselessly
leave
café
immediately
without
stopping
for
luncheon
remembering
to
fee
waiter
for
place
retained
proceed
to
box
office
metropolitan
theatre
buy
a
parquet
ticket
for
matinée
the
pied
piper
at
end
of
first
act
read
env
no
jr
the
woodbridge
blood
was
up
now
and
it
was
with
an
expression
resembling
that
of
his
grandfather
cornelius
under
strong
indignation
that
cyrus
stalked
out
of
that
charming
place
to
proceed
grimly
toward
the
metropolitan
theatre
who
wants
to
see
a
matinée
on
an
empty
stomach
he
groaned
i
suppose
i
be
ordered
out
anyway
the
minute
i
sit
down
and
stretch
my
legs
wonder
if
father
can
be
exactly
right
in
his
mind
he
does
believe
in
wasting
time
but
i
wasting
it
by
the
bucketful
suppose
doing
this
to
size
me
up
some
way
he
is
going
to
tire
me
out
as
quick
as
he
thinks
i
keep
going
till
i
drop
nevertheless
when
at
the
end
of
the
first
act
of
a
pretty
play
by
a
company
of
school
children
he
was
ordered
to
go
three
miles
to
a
football
field
and
then
ordered
away
again
without
a
sight
of
the
game
he
had
planned
for
a
week
to
see
his
disgust
was
intense
all
through
that
long
warm
afternoon
he
raced
about
the
city
and
suburbs
growing
wearier
and
more
empty
with
every
step
the
worst
of
it
was
the
orders
were
beginning
to
assume
the
form
of
a
schedule
and
commanded
that
he
be
here
at
and
there
at
and
so
on
which
forbade
loitering
had
he
been
inclined
to
loiter
in
it
all
he
could
see
no
purpose
except
the
possible
one
of
trying
his
physical
endurance
he
was
a
strong
boy
or
he
would
have
been
quite
exhausted
long
before
he
reached
env
no
which
was
the
last
but
three
of
the
packet
this
read
reach
home
at
before
entering
house
read
no
jr
leaning
against
one
of
the
big
white
stone
pillars
of
the
porch
of
his
home
cyrus
wearily
tore
open
no
and
the
words
fairly
swam
before
his
eyes
he
had
to
rub
them
hard
to
make
sure
that
he
was
not
mistaken
go
again
to
kingston
heights
corner
west
and
dwight
streets
reaching
there
by
read
no
jr
the
boy
looked
up
at
the
windows
desperately
angry
at
last
if
his
pride
and
his
sense
of
the
meaning
of
that
phrase
my
word
of
honour
as
the
men
of
the
woodbridge
family
were
in
the
habit
of
teaching
it
to
their
sons
had
not
been
both
of
the
strongest
sort
he
would
have
rebelled
and
gone
defiantly
and
stormily
in
as
it
was
he
stood
for
one
long
minute
with
his
hands
clenched
and
his
teeth
set
then
he
turned
and
walked
down
the
steps
away
from
the
dinner
and
out
toward
l
street
and
the
car
for
kingston
heights
as
he
did
so
inside
the
house
on
the
other
side
of
the
curtain
from
behind
which
he
had
been
anxiously
peering
cornelius
woodbridge
senior
turned
about
and
struck
his
hands
together
rubbing
them
in
a
satisfied
way
he
come
and
gone
he
cried
softly
and
he
on
time
to
the
minute
cornelius
junior
did
not
so
much
as
lift
his
eyes
from
the
evening
paper
as
he
quietly
answered
is
he
but
the
corners
of
his
mouth
slightly
relaxed
one
who
knew
him
well
might
have
guessed
that
he
thought
it
a
simple
matter
to
risk
any
number
of
chances
on
a
sure
thing
the
car
seemed
to
crawl
out
to
kingston
heights
as
it
at
last
neared
its
terminus
a
strong
temptation
seized
the
boy
cyrus
he
had
been
on
a
purposeless
errand
to
this
place
once
that
day
the
corner
of
west
and
dwight
streets
lay
more
than
half
a
mile
from
the
end
of
the
car
route
and
it
was
an
almost
untenanted
district
his
legs
were
very
tired
his
stomach
ached
with
emptiness
why
not
wait
out
the
interval
which
it
would
take
to
walk
to
the
corner
and
back
in
the
little
suburban
station
read
env
no
and
spare
himself
he
had
certainly
done
enough
to
prove
that
he
was
a
faithful
messenger
had
he
certain
old
and
words
came
into
his
mind
they
had
been
in
his
in
his
early
chain
is
no
stronger
than
its
weakest
cyrus
jumped
off
the
car
before
it
fairly
stopped
and
started
at
a
hot
pace
for
the
corner
of
west
and
dwight
streets
there
must
be
no
weak
places
in
his
word
of
honour
doggedly
he
went
to
the
extreme
limit
of
the
indicated
route
even
taking
the
longest
way
round
to
make
the
turn
as
he
started
back
beneath
the
arc
light
at
the
corner
there
suddenly
appeared
a
city
messenger
boy
he
approached
cyrus
grinning
and
held
out
an
envelope
ordered
to
give
you
this
he
said
if
you
made
connections
if
been
later
than
five
minutes
past
seven
i
was
to
keep
dark
you
got
seven
minutes
and
a
half
to
spare
queer
orders
but
the
big
railroad
boss
woodbridge
give
to
me
cyrus
made
his
way
back
to
the
car
with
some
that
served
to
brace
up
the
muscles
behind
his
knees
this
last
incident
showed
him
plainly
that
his
father
was
putting
him
to
a
severe
test
of
some
sort
and
he
could
have
no
doubt
that
it
was
for
a
purpose
his
father
was
the
kind
of
man
who
does
things
with
a
very
definite
purpose
indeed
cyrus
looked
back
over
the
day
with
an
anxious
searching
of
his
memory
to
be
sure
that
no
detail
of
the
singular
service
required
of
him
had
been
slighted
as
he
once
more
ascended
the
steps
of
his
own
home
he
was
so
confident
that
his
labours
were
now
ended
that
he
almost
forgot
about
env
no
which
he
had
been
directed
to
read
in
the
vestibule
before
entering
the
house
with
his
thumb
on
the
he
recollected
and
with
a
sigh
broke
open
the
final
seal
turn
about
and
go
to
lenox
street
station
b
railroad
reaching
there
by
wait
for
messenger
in
west
end
of
station
by
telegraph
office
jr
it
was
a
blow
but
cyrus
had
his
second
wind
now
he
felt
like
a
machine
a
hollow
one
which
could
keep
on
going
indefinitely
i
know
how
an
automobile
feels
he
said
to
himself
rolling
about
from
one
place
to
another
never
knowing
where
it
due
next
always
waiting
outside
never
getting
fed
wonder
if
eating
is
on
this
schedule
i
have
laid
in
something
besides
a
chop
and
a
roll
this
morning
at
breakfast
if
i
known
what
was
ahead
the
lenox
station
was
easily
reached
on
time
the
hands
of
the
big
clock
were
only
at
one
minute
past
eight
when
cyrus
entered
at
the
designated
spot
the
messenger
met
him
cyrus
recognized
the
man
as
a
porter
on
one
of
the
trains
of
the
road
of
which
his
grandfather
and
father
were
officers
why
yes
he
was
the
porter
of
the
woodbridge
special
car
he
brought
the
boy
a
card
which
ran
thus
give
porter
the
letter
from
norwalk
building
the
card
received
at
restaurant
the
matinée
coupon
yesterday
evening
and
the
envelope
received
at
kingston
heights
cyrus
silently
delivered
up
these
articles
feeling
a
sense
of
thankfulness
that
not
one
was
missing
the
porter
went
away
with
them
but
was
back
in
three
minutes
this
way
sir
he
said
and
cyrus
followed
his
heart
beating
fast
down
the
track
he
recognized
the
fleetwing
president
private
car
and
grandfather
cornelius
he
knew
to
be
just
starting
on
a
tour
of
his
own
and
other
roads
which
included
a
flying
trip
to
mexico
could
it
be
possible
in
the
car
his
father
and
grandfather
rose
to
meet
him
cornelius
woodbridge
senior
was
holding
out
his
hand
cyrus
lad
he
said
his
face
one
broad
triumphant
smile
you
have
stood
the
test
the
hezekiah
woodbridge
test
sir
and
you
may
be
proud
of
it
your
word
of
honour
can
be
depended
upon
you
are
going
with
us
through
nineteen
states
and
mexico
is
that
reward
enough
for
one
hardship
i
think
it
is
sir
agreed
cyrus
his
round
face
reflecting
his
grandfather
smile
intensified
was
it
a
hard
pull
cyrus
questioned
the
elder
woodbridge
with
interest
cyrus
looked
at
his
father
i
do
think
so
now
sir
he
said
both
gentlemen
laughed
are
you
hungry
well
just
a
little
grandfather
dinner
will
be
served
the
moment
we
are
off
we
only
six
minutes
to
wait
i
afraid
i
very
much
afraid
the
old
gentleman
turned
to
gaze
searchingly
out
of
the
car
window
into
the
station
that
another
boy
word
of
honour
is
he
stood
watch
in
hand
the
conductor
came
in
and
remained
awaiting
orders
two
minutes
more
jefferson
he
said
one
and
a
half
one
half
a
minute
he
spoke
sternly
pull
out
at
on
the
second
sir
ah
the
porter
entered
hurriedly
and
delivered
a
handful
of
envelopes
into
grandfather
cornelius
grasp
the
old
gentleman
scanned
them
at
a
glance
yes
yes
all
right
he
cried
with
the
strongest
evidences
of
excitement
cyrus
had
ever
seen
in
his
usually
imperturbable
manner
as
the
train
made
its
first
gentle
motion
of
departure
a
figure
appeared
in
the
doorway
quietly
not
at
all
out
of
breath
and
with
precisely
his
own
nonchalant
manner
cornelius
woodbridge
walked
into
the
car
then
grandfather
woodbridge
grew
impressive
he
advanced
and
shook
hands
with
his
grandson
as
if
he
were
greeting
a
distinguished
member
of
the
board
of
directors
then
he
turned
to
his
son
and
shook
hands
with
him
also
solemnly
his
eyes
shone
through
his
spectacles
but
his
voice
was
grave
with
feeling
i
congratulate
you
cornelius
he
said
on
possessing
two
sons
whose
word
of
honour
is
of
the
sort
to
satisfy
the
hezekiah
woodbridge
standard
the
smallest
deviation
from
the
outlined
schedule
would
have
resulted
disastrously
ten
minutes
tardiness
at
the
different
points
would
have
failed
to
obtain
the
requisite
documents
your
sons
did
not
fail
they
can
be
depended
upon
the
world
is
in
search
of
men
built
on
those
lines
i
congratulate
you
sir
cyrus
was
glad
presently
to
escape
to
his
stateroom
with
cornelius
say
what
did
you
have
to
do
he
asked
eagerly
did
you
trot
your
legs
off
all
over
town
not
much
i
did
said
cornelius
grimly
from
the
depths
of
a
big
towel
i
spent
the
whole
day
in
a
little
hole
of
a
room
at
the
top
of
an
empty
building
with
just
ten
trips
down
the
stairs
to
the
ground
floor
to
get
envelopes
at
certain
minutes
not
a
crumb
to
eat
nor
a
thing
to
do
could
even
snatch
a
nap
for
fear
i
oversleep
one
of
my
dates
at
the
bottom
had
five
engagements
too
one
with
helena
fowler
at
the
links
all
i
could
do
was
to
cut
and
stick
it
out
casabianca
was
nothing
to
me
i
believe
that
was
worse
than
mine
commented
cyrus
reflectively
i
should
say
it
was
if
you
do
think
so
try
it
dinner
boys
said
their
father
voice
at
the
door
and
they
lost
no
time
in
responding
when
they
had
taken
their
seats
and
the
waiter
came
for
cornelius
order
that
youth
simply
pushed
the
card
of
the
elaborate
menu
to
one
side
and
said
emphatically
quite
without
his
customary
drawl
bring
me
everything
and
twice
of
it
me
too
said
cyrus
with
enthusiasm
iv
half
a
league
onward
the
rev
arthur
thorndyke
stirred
at
his
desk
with
a
vague
impatience
on
account
of
a
little
droning
sound
which
had
been
bothering
him
for
the
last
ten
minutes
without
his
realizing
what
it
was
he
recognized
at
last
that
it
was
the
boy
david
in
the
alcove
where
he
had
asked
to
be
allowed
to
stay
promising
not
to
bother
uncle
arthur
with
his
work
for
uncle
arthur
was
very
busy
with
his
memorial
day
address
at
least
he
was
struggling
desperately
to
be
very
busy
with
it
although
so
far
he
had
succeeded
only
in
spoiling
half
a
dozen
sheets
of
paper
with
as
many
inadequate
introductions
for
you
see
major
arthur
thorndyke
had
explained
to
the
boy
when
he
had
come
on
his
crutches
into
his
uncle
study
that
morning
this
is
such
very
new
business
to
me
i
having
a
pretty
hard
time
trying
to
think
of
anything
good
and
fine
enough
to
say
to
the
men
in
blue
and
gray
and
brown
for
we
have
all
sorts
here
you
know
it
was
true
that
uncle
arthur
was
a
very
uncle
but
he
was
tall
and
big
and
he
had
been
preaching
for
a
year
now
and
david
thought
that
he
preached
very
good
sermons
indeed
besides
he
had
been
in
the
spanish
war
one
of
the
youngest
privates
in
uncle
company
and
he
ought
to
know
all
about
it
even
though
he
had
really
been
in
very
few
engagements
i
guess
you
can
do
it
uncle
arthur
said
david
comfortingly
and
i
keep
very
still
in
the
alcove
i
would
play
somewhere
else
only
you
see
it
the
only
window
that
looks
out
over
the
square
and
my
playing
is
out
there
uncle
arthur
had
not
taken
time
to
ask
him
what
he
meant
but
afterward
when
the
little
droning
sound
had
begun
to
annoy
him
he
found
out
he
peeped
in
between
the
curtains
of
the
alcove
and
saw
at
once
what
was
out
in
the
square
it
was
the
major
regiment
to
other
people
the
square
might
have
seemed
to
be
a
very
quiet
place
full
of
trees
and
may
sunshine
with
a
few
babies
and
nurses
and
placid
pedestrians
as
its
only
occupants
but
uncle
arthur
perceived
at
once
from
the
aspect
of
the
major
that
it
was
a
place
of
wild
carnage
of
desperate
assault
of
the
clash
and
shock
of
arms
the
major
stood
erect
supported
by
one
crutch
the
other
crutch
was
being
waved
in
the
air
as
by
one
who
orders
on
a
mass
of
fighting
men
from
the
major
lips
issued
the
subdued
but
passionate
words
flash
all
their
sabres
bare
flash
as
they
turned
in
air
sabring
th
gunners
there
charging
an
army
while
all
th
world
wonder
plunged
in
th
right
through
th
line
they
broke
cossack
an
russian
reeled
from
th
scatter
an
shunder
then
they
rode
back
but
not
the
boy
voice
wavered
uncle
arthur
saw
him
put
up
a
thin
hand
and
wipe
his
white
little
brow
major
david
plays
were
always
intensely
real
to
him
the
six
he
murmured
and
sank
down
on
the
gazing
mournfully
out
over
the
square
but
in
a
moment
he
was
up
again
cannon
to
right
of
he
began
again
sternly
cannon
to
left
of
uncle
arthur
crept
away
without
bidding
him
remember
his
promise
what
is
a
memorial
day
address
beside
the
charge
of
a
light
brigade
it
was
only
two
days
after
this
that
david
mother
summoned
four
uncles
to
a
conference
david
had
no
father
there
was
a
granite
boulder
up
in
the
cemetery
which
ever
since
david
was
four
years
old
he
was
ten
now
had
been
draped
once
a
year
with
a
beautiful
silken
flag
all
the
thorndyke
men
had
been
soldiers
and
david
father
had
died
at
the
front
where
the
thorndyke
men
usually
died
it
was
a
matter
of
great
pride
to
david
every
year
that
silken
flag
david
four
uncles
were
all
soldiers
in
a
way
there
was
uncle
chester
he
had
been
breveted
colonel
at
the
close
of
the
civil
war
and
colonel
thorndyke
he
was
against
his
will
always
called
still
next
came
uncle
stephen
he
was
a
captain
of
artillery
in
the
regular
army
and
had
lately
come
home
on
a
furlough
after
three
years
service
in
the
philippines
then
there
was
uncle
stuart
just
getting
strong
after
an
attack
of
typhoid
fever
in
a
week
he
would
be
back
at
west
point
where
he
was
a
first
classman
and
a
cadet
lieutenant
as
for
uncle
arthur
david
always
regretted
deeply
that
he
was
no
longer
in
either
volunteer
or
regular
army
although
he
took
some
comfort
from
the
fact
that
uncle
arthur
sometimes
told
him
that
he
had
never
felt
more
like
a
soldier
than
he
did
now
it
was
a
hasty
and
a
serious
conference
this
to
which
roger
thorndyke
had
summoned
her
dead
husband
three
brothers
and
his
uncle
she
felt
the
need
of
all
their
counsel
for
she
had
a
grave
question
to
settle
she
was
a
young
woman
with
a
sweet
decisiveness
of
character
all
her
own
yet
when
a
woman
has
four
men
upon
whom
she
can
call
for
wisdom
to
support
her
own
judgment
she
would
be
an
unwise
person
to
ignore
that
fact
it
just
this
she
told
them
when
she
had
closed
the
door
of
arthur
study
where
they
had
assembled
you
know
how
long
we
been
hoping
something
could
be
done
for
david
and
how
you
all
insisted
that
when
doctor
wendell
should
decide
he
was
strong
enough
for
the
operation
on
the
we
must
have
it
well
he
says
a
great
english
surgeon
sir
edmund
barrister
will
be
here
for
just
two
days
he
comes
to
see
the
little
woodbridge
girl
and
to
operate
on
her
if
he
thinks
it
best
and
doctor
wendell
urges
upon
me
that
it
my
chance
she
had
spoken
quietly
but
her
face
paled
a
little
as
she
ended
her
youngest
stuart
the
cadet
himself
but
lately
out
of
hospital
was
first
to
speak
when
does
he
come
great
guns
the
little
chap
close
up
to
it
does
he
know
oh
no
i
would
tell
him
till
it
was
all
arranged
indeed
i
sure
whether
you
better
tell
him
at
all
oh
yes
you
will
helen
the
major
must
stand
up
to
be
fired
at
blindfold
this
was
from
captain
stephen
the
only
one
of
the
four
now
in
active
service
you
all
think
it
best
to
have
it
done
why
it
as
wendell
says
now
the
chance
to
have
the
best
man
in
that
line
you
can
rest
assured
the
woodbridges
would
never
stop
at
anything
short
of
the
finest
besides
the
englishman
reputation
is
international
of
course
it
must
be
done
this
was
stuart
again
the
cadet
lieutenant
had
already
acquired
the
tone
of
command
he
was
an
excellent
cadet
lieutenant
but
thorndyke
looked
past
stuart
at
her
uncle
chester
colonel
thorndyke
civil
war
veteran
it
was
upon
his
opinion
that
she
most
relied
he
nodded
at
her
he
right
nell
he
said
it
our
chance
the
boy
seems
to
me
in
as
good
condition
for
it
as
he
ever
be
he
spoke
very
gently
for
to
his
mind
as
to
them
all
rose
the
vision
of
a
delicate
little
face
and
figure
frail
with
the
frailty
of
the
child
who
has
been
for
six
years
a
cripple
so
it
was
decided
with
few
words
that
the
great
surgeon
should
see
david
upon
the
morrow
to
operate
upon
him
at
once
if
he
thought
wise
as
the
local
surgeon
doctor
wendell
was
confident
he
would
then
arose
another
question
who
should
tell
david
somehow
i
think
said
thorndyke
looking
from
one
to
another
of
the
four
who
surrounded
her
it
would
be
easier
for
him
from
one
of
you
he
thinks
so
much
of
your
being
soldiers
you
know
he
always
playing
he
a
soldier
and
if
if
one
of
you
could
put
it
to
him
in
a
sort
of
military
way
she
stopped
for
this
time
her
lips
were
really
trembling
they
looked
at
one
another
the
four
men
and
there
was
not
a
volunteer
for
the
task
after
a
minute
however
arthur
lifting
his
eyes
from
the
rug
which
he
had
been
intently
studying
found
the
others
were
all
facing
him
you
the
one
said
captain
stephen
thorndyke
i
think
you
are
agreed
colonel
chester
thorndyke
it
up
to
you
art
declared
cadet
lieutenant
thorndyke
with
his
usual
decision
of
manner
so
although
arthur
protested
that
he
was
not
as
fit
for
the
mission
as
any
of
the
others
they
would
not
let
him
off
you
the
one
he
swears
by
stephen
said
and
stuart
added
put
on
your
old
khaki
clothes
art
that
tickle
the
major
so
he
wo
mind
what
you
tell
him
it
was
a
suggestion
which
appealed
to
the
young
clergyman
as
he
lay
awake
that
night
thinking
how
he
should
tell
the
boy
in
the
morning
it
seemed
to
him
somehow
that
it
would
take
the
edge
off
the
thing
if
he
could
meet
david
in
the
old
uniform
which
the
child
was
always
begging
to
see
just
before
he
fell
asleep
he
thought
of
his
memorial
day
address
since
the
morning
day
before
yesterday
when
david
play
had
interrupted
his
first
futile
efforts
at
it
he
had
found
no
time
to
work
on
it
he
had
had
a
wedding
and
two
funerals
to
attend
besides
having
to
look
after
the
preparation
for
his
sunday
services
the
following
saturday
would
be
memorial
day
meanwhile
there
was
david
the
next
morning
thorndyke
on
her
way
to
arthur
study
to
tell
him
that
the
doctor
had
telephoned
that
he
would
bring
the
english
surgeon
to
the
house
at
eleven
for
the
preliminary
examination
ran
into
a
tall
figure
in
a
khaki
uniform
a
battered
slouch
hat
in
his
hand
why
arthur
she
cried
then
added
quickly
oh
my
dear
that
just
what
will
please
him
i
so
glad
it
you
who
are
to
tell
him
know
how
i
do
know
how
said
her
brother
and
she
saw
that
his
eyes
were
heavy
but
i
expect
the
will
show
me
how
and
with
these
words
he
went
into
his
study
and
closed
the
door
for
a
moment
before
david
should
come
in
order
that
he
might
get
his
instructions
from
headquarters
when
the
boy
came
in
on
his
crutches
he
found
a
soldierly
figure
awaiting
him
he
saluted
and
the
tall
corporal
returned
the
salute
the
deep
eyes
of
the
man
met
the
clear
bright
ones
of
the
child
and
the
corporal
said
to
the
major
i
am
ordered
to
report
to
you
sir
that
the
enemy
is
encamped
on
the
opposite
shore
and
is
preparing
to
attack
half
an
hour
afterward
thorndyke
came
anxiously
to
the
door
of
the
study
hearing
cheerful
voices
within
she
knocked
and
was
bidden
to
enter
her
first
glance
was
at
little
david
face
to
her
surprise
she
saw
there
neither
fear
nor
nervousness
only
an
excited
shining
of
the
eyes
and
an
unusual
flushing
of
the
cheeks
the
boy
rose
to
meet
her
i
ready
mammy
he
announced
in
his
childish
treble
uncle
arthur
says
i
got
a
chance
to
prove
i
a
soldier
son
and
a
thorndyke
and
i
going
to
do
it
the
enemy
encamped
over
in
the
hospital
and
going
to
move
on
his
works
i
going
over
with
my
staff
this
is
corporal
thorndyke
and
colonel
chester
thorndyke
and
captain
stephen
thorndyke
and
lieutenant
stuart
thorndyke
are
my
staff
and
the
corporal
has
promised
that
they
go
with
me
in
uniform
i
going
to
wear
my
uniform
too
may
i
the
oddness
of
the
question
made
in
a
tone
which
dropped
suddenly
and
significantly
from
the
proud
address
of
the
officer
to
the
humble
request
of
the
subaltern
brought
a
very
tender
smile
to
thorndyke
lips
as
she
gave
her
brother
a
grateful
glance
yes
she
said
i
think
you
certainly
ought
to
wear
your
uniform
i
get
it
ready
i
may
be
taken
prisoner
over
there
the
little
soldier
pursued
but
if
i
do
uncle
ar
the
corporal
says
that
the
fortunes
of
war
and
i
must
take
it
as
it
comes
downstairs
presently
david
under
a
flag
of
truce
met
the
opposing
general
and
his
staff
the
englishman
with
the
kind
manner
made
an
excellent
general
david
thought
they
detained
him
only
a
but
when
he
left
them
it
was
with
the
understanding
that
his
army
should
move
forward
at
once
and
attack
upon
the
morrow
it
seemed
a
bit
unusual
not
to
say
unmilitary
to
david
to
arrange
such
matters
so
thoroughly
with
the
enemy
but
his
corporal
assured
him
that
under
certain
conditions
the
thing
was
done
there
being
no
other
part
of
the
charge
that
would
fit
david
said
over
to
himself
a
great
many
times
on
the
way
to
the
hospital
the
opening
lines
half
a
league
half
a
league
half
a
league
onward
all
in
th
valley
of
death
rode
th
six
hundred
as
he
went
up
the
hospital
steps
on
his
crutches
because
he
would
not
let
anybody
carry
him
the
situation
seemed
to
him
much
better
he
stopped
upon
the
top
step
balanced
himself
upon
one
crutch
and
waved
the
other
at
his
staff
and
at
the
six
hundred
pressing
on
behind
forward
th
light
brigade
for
th
guns
he
said
what
the
little
chap
saying
uncle
chester
murmured
into
the
ear
of
uncle
arthur
as
the
small
figure
hurried
on
he
living
out
charge
of
the
light
brigade
arthur
answered
and
there
was
no
smile
on
his
lips
uncle
chester
swallowed
something
in
his
throat
it
may
have
been
a
common
thing
for
the
hospital
nurses
and
doctors
to
see
a
patient
in
military
clothes
arrive
accompanied
by
four
other
military
figures
the
uniforms
a
little
mixed
but
if
they
were
surprised
they
gave
no
sign
the
nurse
who
put
david
to
bed
wore
a
red
cross
badge
on
her
sleeve
hastily
constructed
by
doctor
wendell
this
badge
david
regarded
with
delight
why
you
a
real
army
nurse
are
you
he
asked
happily
of
course
they
are
the
kind
to
take
care
of
soldiers
she
returned
and
after
that
there
was
a
special
bond
between
them
when
they
had
finished
with
david
that
night
he
was
rather
glad
to
have
corporal
thorndyke
say
to
him
that
there
was
a
brief
cessation
of
hostilities
and
that
the
men
were
to
have
the
chance
for
a
few
sleep
but
you
stay
by
wo
you
corporal
requested
the
major
sleepily
certainly
sir
responded
the
corporal
saluting
i
be
right
here
all
night
the
corporal
at
this
point
was
so
unmilitary
as
to
bend
over
and
kiss
him
but
as
this
was
immediately
followed
by
a
series
of
caresses
from
his
mother
the
major
thought
it
best
not
to
mind
indeed
it
was
very
comforting
and
he
might
have
missed
it
if
it
had
not
happened
even
though
he
was
supposed
to
be
in
the
field
and
sleeping
upon
his
arms
the
next
morning
things
happened
rather
rapidly
no
rations
major
said
the
red
cross
nurse
when
he
inquired
for
his
breakfast
commissary
department
left
far
to
the
rear
explained
the
corporal
with
his
salute
and
of
course
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
although
it
did
seem
a
little
hard
to
face
the
jaws
of
death
with
no
food
to
hearten
one
a
number
of
things
were
done
to
david
then
doctor
wendell
came
in
and
sat
down
by
the
high
white
bed
and
with
a
reassuring
smile
at
his
patient
gave
him
a
few
brief
directions
the
corporal
took
david
hand
in
his
and
held
it
with
the
tight
grip
of
the
comrade
who
means
to
stand
by
to
the
last
ditch
forward
th
light
brigade
was
a
man
dismay
not
though
the
soldier
knew
some
had
blunder
god
forbid
murmured
the
corporal
as
the
words
trailed
slowly
out
into
the
air
from
under
doctor
wendell
hand
theirs
not
to
make
reply
theirs
not
to
reason
why
theirs
but
to
do
an
die
the
corporal
set
his
teeth
presently
he
looked
across
the
bed
and
met
the
eyes
of
the
major
mother
so
far
so
good
he
said
nodding
to
her
as
the
small
hand
in
his
relaxed
its
hold
talk
about
sheer
pluck
growled
captain
stephen
thorndyke
in
the
where
he
and
colonel
chester
and
cadet
stuart
were
marching
up
and
down
during
the
period
of
suspense
it
that
of
the
light
brigade
that
floors
me
said
stuart
if
the
youngster
just
whimper
a
little
but
to
go
under
whispering
not
to
make
reply
he
choked
and
frankly
drew
his
gray
sleeve
across
his
eyes
it
the
thorndyke
spirit
said
colonel
chester
proudly
he
boy
all
right
there
were
two
or
three
doubtful
bulletins
then
arthur
brought
them
the
good
news
that
the
major
had
been
brought
back
from
the
and
was
rallying
bravely
but
will
he
pull
through
these
successful
operations
do
always
end
successfully
said
stuart
as
he
and
arthur
paced
down
the
corridor
together
that
what
we
got
to
wait
and
hope
and
pray
for
answered
arthur
it
the
at
with
shot
and
shell
the
major
be
reciting
now
if
he
could
do
anything
but
shut
his
lips
together
and
try
to
bear
the
pain
it
be
five
or
six
days
they
say
before
we
can
call
him
out
of
danger
disease
of
davy
form
is
cured
by
anything
short
of
this
grave
operation
and
it
taking
a
good
many
chances
of
course
in
the
little
chap
delicate
condition
but
we
all
his
own
staunch
courage
on
our
side
and
somehow
well
stuart
i
got
to
preach
and
next
week
that
memorial
address
how
do
you
suppose
going
to
do
it
the
major
wants
me
on
hospital
duty
every
hour
between
now
and
then
that
memorial
day
address
how
was
a
distraught
young
clergyman
to
think
of
material
for
such
an
address
when
he
was
held
captive
at
the
bedside
of
a
little
soldier
fighting
for
his
life
it
was
the
fourth
day
before
anxiety
began
to
lessen
its
grip
the
fifth
the
sixth
before
doctor
wendell
would
begin
to
speak
confidently
through
it
all
the
words
of
the
charge
beat
in
arthur
thorndyke
brain
till
it
seemed
to
him
that
if
david
died
he
should
never
hear
anything
else
for
they
were
constantly
on
the
boy
lips
finally
on
the
morning
of
saturday
arthur
said
to
david
major
this
is
the
day
for
you
to
say
the
last
lines
you
know
this
afternoon
the
hundred
are
going
by
you
hear
the
band
play
and
uncle
chester
and
uncle
stephen
will
be
marching
in
the
ranks
stuart
and
i
will
be
there
too
somewhere
and
i
think
if
we
can
just
prop
you
up
a
little
bit
you
be
able
to
see
at
least
the
heads
of
the
men
and
you
can
salute
you
know
even
if
they
ca
see
you
after
the
procession
are
you
going
to
speak
to
them
asked
david
arthur
smiled
after
some
sort
of
fashion
i
going
to
open
my
mouth
he
said
i
hardly
know
myself
what
will
come
out
all
i
do
know
is
i
never
had
quite
so
much
respect
for
the
courage
that
faces
the
mouth
as
now
and
it
you
major
who
are
the
pluckiest
soldier
i
know
he
smiled
down
at
the
white
little
face
its
great
gray
eyes
staring
up
at
him
uncle
arthur
but
but
i
was
plucky
all
the
time
sometimes
it
hurt
so
i
had
to
cry
the
words
were
a
whisper
but
uncle
arthur
still
smiled
that
count
major
he
said
now
i
must
go
watch
for
the
band
away
in
the
distance
by
and
by
came
the
music
as
it
approached
mingled
with
it
david
could
hear
the
sound
of
marching
feet
his
mother
and
the
red
cross
nurse
propped
his
head
up
a
very
little
so
that
he
could
see
into
the
street
louder
and
louder
grew
the
strains
then
stopped
the
drums
beat
oh
they
not
going
to
play
as
they
go
by
cried
david
disappointed
the
tramp
of
the
marching
feet
came
nearer
suddenly
the
band
burst
with
a
crash
into
the
banner
david
eyes
shone
with
delight
they
halting
in
front
of
us
david
said
the
nurse
so
they
were
david
could
see
them
the
music
reached
the
end
of
the
tune
and
stopped
a
shout
broke
upon
the
air
it
was
a
cheer
it
took
words
and
swelled
into
david
room
but
it
was
a
gentle
cheer
not
a
vociferous
one
it
was
given
by
lieutenant
roger
thorndyke
old
company
and
the
words
of
it
were
wonderful
comrade
david
lay
back
on
his
pillow
his
face
shining
with
happiness
he
would
never
forget
that
those
soldiers
of
his
father
regiment
the
th
new
york
had
called
him
comrade
he
thought
of
them
tenderly
he
murmured
the
closing
words
of
the
charge
and
by
them
he
meant
the
men
who
had
stood
outside
his
window
and
cheered
when
can
their
glory
fade
o
th
wild
charge
they
made
all
th
world
wonder
honour
th
charge
they
made
honour
th
light
brigade
noble
six
hundred
an
hour
afterward
they
came
in
together
his
four
thorndyke
soldiers
in
their
uniforms
all
but
uncle
arthur
who
because
he
was
a
clergyman
and
had
had
to
make
a
speech
had
felt
obliged
to
put
on
a
frock
coat
here
the
fellow
who
been
worrying
over
his
memorial
day
address
cried
uncle
stephen
proudly
it
was
a
rousing
good
one
declared
stuart
never
heard
a
better
agreed
uncle
chester
he
gone
a
league
onward
if
the
rest
of
us
have
stood
still

a

by

this
is
a
charming
story
of
a
group
of
girl
and
men
friends
and
the
effect
of
their
pairing
off
upon
the
narrator
and
her
philosopher
althea

camellia
dahlia
hepatica
and
their
several
entanglements
with
the
promoter
the
cashier
the
skeptic
the
judge
and
the
professor
form
an
admirable
background
of
diverse
personalities
against
which
grows
the
main
love
story
one
sees
these
charming
groups
through
the
eyes
of
the
one
who
tells
the
tale
and
very
shrewd
and
delightful
eyes
they
are
seeing
life
in
its
true
perspective
with
much
real
philosophy
and
true
feeling
