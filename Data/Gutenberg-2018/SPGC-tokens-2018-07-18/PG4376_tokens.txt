i
sowing
seeds
in
danny
in
her
comfortable
sitting
room
burton
francis
sat
at
peace
with
herself
and
all
mankind
the
glory
of
the
short
winter
afternoon
streamed
into
the
room
and
touched
with
new
warmth
and
tenderness
the
face
of
a
madonna
on
the
wall
the
whole
room
suggested
peace
the
quiet
elegance
of
its
furnishings
the
soft
books
on
the
table
the
dreamy
face
of
the
occupant
who
sat
with
folded
hands
looking
out
of
the
window
were
all
in
strange
contrast
to
the
dreariness
of
the
scene
below
where
the
one
long
street
of
the
little
manitoba
town
piled
high
with
snow
stretched
away
into
the
level
white
prairie
a
farmer
tried
to
force
his
tired
horses
through
the
drifts
a
little
boy
with
a
plodded
bravely
from
door
to
door
sometimes
laying
down
his
burden
to
blow
his
breath
on
his
stinging
fingers
the
only
sound
that
disturbed
the
quiet
of
the
afternoon
in
francis
sitting
room
was
the
regular
of
the
in
the
kitchen
below
watson
is
slow
with
the
washing
francis
murmured
with
a
look
of
concern
on
her
usually
placid
face
possibly
she
is
not
well
i
will
call
her
and
see
watson
will
you
come
upstairs
please
she
called
from
the
stairway
watson
slow
and
shambling
came
up
the
stairs
and
stood
in
the
doorway
wiping
her
face
on
her
apron
is
it
me
ye
want
she
asked
when
she
had
recovered
her
breath
yes
watson
francis
said
sweetly
i
thought
perhaps
you
were
not
feeling
well
i
have
not
heard
you
singing
at
your
work
and
the
washing
seems
to
have
gone
slowly
you
must
be
very
careful
of
your
health
and
not
overdo
your
strength
while
she
was
speaking
watson
eyes
were
busy
with
the
room
the
pictures
on
the
wall
the
cosey
with
its
numerous
cushions
the
warmth
and
brightness
of
it
all
brought
a
glow
to
her
tired
face
yes
she
said
thank
ye
kindly
it
is
very
kind
of
ye
to
be
thinkin
o
the
likes
of
me
oh
we
should
always
think
of
others
you
know
francis
replied
quickly
with
her
most
winning
smile
as
she
seated
herself
in
a
are
the
children
all
well
dear
little
danny
how

he
indade
that
same
danny

home
sez
he
oh
the
sweet
prattle
of
childhood
said
francis
clasping
her
shapely
white
hands
how
very
interesting
it
must
be
to
watch
their
young
minds
unfolding
as
the
flower
is
it
nine
little
ones
you
have
mrs
watson
yes
nine
it
is
god
save
us
teddy
will
be
fourteen
on
patrick
day
and
all
the
rest
are
younger
it
is
a
great
responsibility
to
be
a
mother
and
yet
how
few
there
be
that
think
of
it
added
francis
dreamily
thrue
for
ye
watson
broke
in
there
my
own
man
john
watson
that
man
knows
no
more
of
what
it
manes
than
you
do
yerself
that
has
one
at
all
at
all
the
lord
be
praised
and
him
the
father
of
nine
i
have
just
been
reading
a
great
book
by
ernestus
parker
on
it
would
be
a
great
benefit
to
both
you
and
your
husband
och
watson
broke
in
hastily
john
is
no
hand
for
books
and
has
always
had
his
suspicions
o
them
since
his
own
william
mulcahey
got
himself
transported
durin
life
or
good
behaviour
for
havin
one
found
on
him
no
an
almanac
at
the
time
of
the
riots
in
ireland
no
john
would
rade
it
at
all
at
all
and
he
do
know
one
letther
from
another
what
more
then
if
you
would
read
it
and
explain
it
to
him
it
would
be
so
helpful
to
you
both
and
so
inspiring
it
deals
so
ably
with
the
problems
of
you
must
be
puzzled
many
times
in
the
training
of
so
many
little
minds
and
parker
really
does
throw
wonderful
light
on
all
the
problems
that
confront
mothers
and
i
am
sure
the
mother
of
nine
must
have
a
great
many
perplexities
yes
watson
had
a
great
many
perplexities
how
to
make
trousers
for
four
boys
out
of
the
one
old
pair
the
minister
wife
had
given
her
how
to
make
the
memory
of
the
they
had
on
sunday
last
all
the
week
how
to
work
all
day
and
sew
at
night
and
still
be
brave
and
patient
how
to
make
little
danny
and
bugsey
forget
they
were
cold
and
hungry
yes
watson
had
her
problems
but
they
were
not
the
kind
that
ernestus
parker
had
dealt
with
in
his
book
on
motherhood
but
i
must
not
keep
you
watson
francis
said
as
she
remembered
the
washing
when
you
go
downstairs
will
you
kindly
bring
me
up
a
small
red
notebook
that
you
will
find
on
the
desk
in
the
library
yes
said
watson
and
went
heavily
down
the
stairs
she
found
the
book
and
brought
it
up
while
she
was
making
the
second
laborious
journey
down
the
softly
padded
stairs
francis
was
making
an
entry
in
the
little
red
book
talked
with
one
woman
re
beauty
of
motherhood
recommended
parker
book
believe
good
done
then
she
closed
the
book
with
a
satisfied
feeling
she
was
going
to
have
a
very
full
report
for
her
department
at
the
next
annual
convention
of
the
society
for
propagation
of
lofty
ideals
in
another
part
of
the
same
manitoba
town
lived
john
watson
unregenerate
hater
of
books
his
wife
and
their
family
of
nine
their
first
dwelling
when
they
had
come
to
manitoba
from
the
ottawa
valley
thirteen
years
ago
had
been
no
but
this
had
soon
to
be
enlarged
which
was
done
by
adding
to
it
other
shanties
one
of
these
was
painted
a
bright
yellow
and
was
a
little
larger
than
the
others
it
had
been
the
caboose
of
a
threshing
outfit
that
john
had
worked
for
in
john
was
the
fireman
and
when
the
boiler
blew
up
and
john
was
carried
home
insensible
the
boys
felt
that
they
should
do
something
for
the
widow
and
orphans
they
raised
one
hundred
and
sixty
dollars
forthwith
every
man
contributing
his
wages
for
the
last
four
days
the
owner
of
the
outfit
sam
motherwell
in
a
strange
fit
of
generosity
donated
the
caboose
the
next
fall
sam
found
that
he
needed
the
caboose
himself
and
came
with
his
trucks
to
take
it
back
he
claimed
that
he
had
given
it
with
the
understanding
that
john
was
going
to
die
john
had
not
fulfilled
his
share
of
the
contract
and
sam
felt
that
his
generosity
had
been
misplaced
john
was
cutting
wood
beside
his
dwelling
when
sam
arrived
with
his
trucks
and
accused
him
of
obtaining
goods
under
false
pretences
john
was
a
man
of
few
words
and
listened
attentively
to
sam
reasoning
from
the
little
window
of
the
caboose
came
the
discordant
wail
of
a
very
young
infant
and
old
sam
felt
his
claims
growing
more
and
more
shadowy
john
took
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
spat
once
at
the
woodpile
then
jerking
his
thumb
toward
the
little
window
he
said
briefly
twins
last
night
sam
motherwell
mounted
his
trucks
and
drove
away
he
knew
when
he
was
beaten
the
house
had
received
additions
on
every
side
until
it
seemed
to
threaten
to
run
over
the
edge
of
the
lot
and
looked
like
a
section
of
a
wrecked
freight
train
with
its
yellow
refrigerator
car
the
snow
had
drifted
up
to
the
windows
and
entirely
over
the
little
that
had
been
erected
at
the
time
that
little
danny
had
added
his
feeble
wail
to
the
general
family
chorus
but
the
smoke
curled
bravely
up
from
the
chimney
into
the
frosty
air
and
a
snug
pile
of
wood
by
the
cheek
of
the
dure
gave
evidence
of
john
industry
notwithstanding
his
dislike
of
the
world
best
literature
inside
the
floor
was
swept
and
the
stove
was
clean
and
an
air
of
comfort
was
over
all
in
spite
of
the
evidence
of
poverty
a
great
variety
of
calendars
hung
on
the
wall
every
store
in
town
it
seems
had
sent
one
this
year
last
year
and
the
year
before
a
large
poster
of
the
winnipeg
industrial
exhibition
hung
in
the
parlour
and
a
in
full
swing
propelled
by
three
maroon
horses
swept
through
a
waving
field
of
golden
grain
driven
by
an
adipose
individual
in
blue
shirt
and
overalls
an
enlarged
picture
of
john
himself
glared
grimly
from
a
very
heavy
frame
on
the
opposite
wall
the
grimness
of
it
somewhat
relieved
by
the
row
of
big
cards
that
were
stuck
in
around
the
frame
on
the
afternoon
that
watson
had
received
the
uplifting
talk
on
motherhood
and
francis
had
entered
it
in
the
little
red
book
pearlie
watson
aged
twelve
was
keeping
the
house
as
she
did
six
days
in
the
week
the
day
was
too
cold
for
even
jimmy
to
be
out
and
so
all
except
the
three
eldest
boys
were
in
the
kitchen
variously
engaged
danny
under
promise
of
a
story

in
the
high
chair
submitting
to
a
thorough
going
over
with
soap
and
water
patsey
looking
up
from
his
task
of
brushing
the
legs
of
the
stove
with
the
loudly
demanded
that
the
story

begin
at

pearlie
as
she

many
times
before

upon
a
time
not

long

there

a
lovely
pink
lady
in
a
big
house
painted
red
with
windies
in
ivery
side
of
it
and
a
bell
on

dure
and
a

lot
of

the
parlow
and
flowers

windies
and
two
yalla
burds
that

as
if
their
hearts

and
the
windies

a
border
of
coloured
glass
all
around
them
and
long
white
curtings
full
of
holes
but
they

and
pale
from

down
and
beginning
operations
on
bugsey

as
swate
as

in
ye
danny
crept
up
on
his
mother

ma
did
she
give
ye
pie
he
asked
wistfully
yes
me
beauty
and
she
sent
this
to
you
wid
her
love
and
watson
took
a
small
piece
out
of
a
newspaper
from
under
her
cape
it
was
the
piece
that
had
been
set
on
the
kitchen
table
for
dinner
danny
called
them
all
to
have
a
bite
sure
it
the
first
bite
that
always
the
best
a
body
might
not
like
it
so
well
on
the
second
said
jimmy
as
he
took
his
but
bugsey
refused
to
have
any
at

he
said
it
just

think

ma
asked
pearlie
as
she
set
danny
in
the
chair
to
give
him
his
supper
the
family
was
fed
in
divisions
danny
was
always
in
division
a
her
is
it
said
watson
and
they
all
listened
for
story
had
far
surpassed
all
her
former
efforts
and
it
seemed
as
if
there
must
be
some
hope
of
its
coming
true
why
och
childer
dear
d
think
a
foine
lady
like
her
would
be
bothered
with
the
likes
of
us
she
is
her

and
writin
letthers
and
thinkin
great
thoughts
all
the
time
when

to
me
she
looked
at
me
so
wonderin
and
faraway
i
could
see
that
she
thought
i
there
at
all
at
all
and
me
farninst
her
all
the
time
no
childer
dear
do
be
thinkin
of

and
pearlie
i
think
ye
better
not
be
puttin
notions
inter
their
heads
yer
father
would
like
it
well
danny
me
man
how
goes
it
went
on
watson
as
her
latest
born
was
eating
his
rather
scanty
supper
it
not
skim
milk
and
dhry
bread
ye
be
havin
if
you
were
her
child
this
night
but
taffy
candy
filled
wid
nuts
and
chunks
o
cake
as
big
as
yer
head
whereupon
danny
wailed
dismally
and
had
to
be
taken
from
his
chair
and
have
the
little
boy
blue
sung
to
him
before
he
could
be
induced
to
go
on
with
his
supper
the
next
morning
when
jimmy
brought
the
milk
to
francis
back
door
the
girl
with
the
smiley
teeth
let
him
in
and
set
a
chair
beside
the
kitchen
stove
for
him
to
warm
his
little
blue
hands
while
she
was
emptying
the
milk
into
the
pitcher
with
the
birds
on
it
francis
with
a
wonderful
pink
kimono
on
came
into
the
kitchen
who
is
this
boy
camilla
she
asked
regarding
jimmy
with
a
critical
gaze
this
is
master
james
watson
francis
answered
camilla
with
her
pleasant
smile
he
brings
the
milk
every
morning
oh
yes
of
course
i
remember
now
said
francis
adjusting
her
glasses
how
old
is
the
baby
james
danny
is
it
said
jim
he
four
come
march
is
he
very
sweet
and
cunning
james
and
do
you
love
him
very
much
oh
he
all
right
jim
answered
sheepishly
it
is
a
great
privilege
to
have
a
little
brother
like
daniel
you
must
be
careful
to
set
before
him
a
good
example
of
honesty
and
sobriety
he
will
be
a
man
some
day
and
if
properly
trained
he
may
be
a
useful
factor
in
the
uplifting
and
refining
of
the
world
i
love
little
children
she
went
on
rapturously
looking
at
jimmy
as
if
he
there
at
all
and
i
would
love
to
train
one
for
service
in
the
world
to
uplift
and
refine
yes
said
jimmy
he
felt
that
something
was
expected
of
him
but
he
was
not
sure
what
will
you
bring
daniel
to
see
me
james
she
said
as
camilla
handed
him
his
pail
i
would
like
to
speak
to
his
young
mind
and
endeavour
to
plant
the
seeds
of
virtue
and
honesty
in
that
fertile
soil
when
jimmy
got
home
he
told
pearlie
of
his
interview
with
the
pink
lady
as
much
as
he
could
remember
the
only
thing
that
he
was
sure
of
was
that
she
wanted
to
see
danny
and
that
she
had
said
something
about
planting
seeds
in
him
jimmy
and
pearlie
thought
it
best
not
to
mention
danny
proposed
visit
to
their
mother
for
they
knew
that
she
would
be
fretting
about
his
clothes
and
would
be
sitting
up
mending
and
sewing
for
him
when
she
should
be
sleeping
so
they
resolved
to
say
nothin
to
nobody
the
next
day
their
mother
went
away
early
to
wash
for
the
methodist
minister
wife
and
that
was
always
a
long
day
work
then
the
work
of
preparation
began
on
danny
a
full
of
snow
was
put
on
the
stove
to
melt
and
danny
was
put
in
the
high
chair
which
was
always
the
place
of
his
ablutions
pearlie
began
to
think
aloud
bugsey
your
stockin
are
the
best
off
wid
them
mary
and
mend
the
hole
in
the
knees
of
them
and
bugsey
hop
into
bed
for
we
be
needin
your
pants
anyway
it
awful
stylish
for
a
little
lad
like
danny
to
be
wearin
pants
under
his
dresses
and
now
what
about
boots
let
see
yours
patsey
they
all

bugsey

and
purtind
they
overstockin
and
i
carry
him
all
the
way
so
not
to
dirty
them
mary
stopped
her
and
drying
her
hands
on
the
thin
towel
that
hung
over
the
looking
glass
found
her
knitting
and
began
to
knit
at
the
top
of
her
speed
is
it
good
we
have
that
dress
o
his
so
good
yet
that
he
got
when
we
had
all
of
yez
christened

the
irons
on
there
mary
never
mind
do
stop
your
knittin
i
do
it
myself
we
press
it
out
a
bit
and
we
can
put
ma
handkerchief
the
one
pa
gev
her
for
christmas
around
his
neck
sort
o
sailor
collar
style
to
show
he
a
boy
and
now
the
snow
is
melted
i
go
at
him
do
cry
now
danny
man
yer
going
up
to
the
big
house
where
the
lovely
pink
lady
lives
that
has
the
chocaklut
drops
on
her
stand
and
chunks
of
cake
on
the
table
wid
nuts
in
them
as
big
as
marbles
there
now
continued
pearlie
putting
the
towel
over
her
finger
and
penetrating
danny
ear
she
not
say
she
can
plant
seeds
in
you
yer
ears
are
as
clean
as
hers
and
pearlie
stood
back
and
took
a
critical
view
of
danny
ears
front
and
back
chockaluts
asked
danny
to
be
sure
that
he
had
been
mistaken
yes
went
on
pearlie
to
keep
him
still
while
she
fixed
his
shock
of
red
hair
into
stubborn
little
curls
and
she
told
again
with
ever
growing
enthusiasm
the
story
of
the
pink
lady
and
the
wonderful
things
she
had
in
the
box
tied
up
with
store
string
at
last
danny
was
completed
and
stood
on
a
chair
for
inspection
but
here
a
digression
from
the
main
issue
occurred
for
bugsey
had
grown
tired
of
his
temporary
confinement
and
complained
that
patsey
had
not
contributed
one
thing
to
danny
wardrobe
while
he
had
had
to
give
up
both
his
stockings
and
his
pants
pearlie
stopped
in
the
work
of
combing
her
own
hair
to
see
what
could
be
done
patsey
where
your
gum
she
asked
git
it
for
me
this
minute
and
patsey
went
to
the
fallen
leaf
of
the
table
and
found
it
on
the
inside
where
he
had
put
it
for
safe
keeping
now
you
give
that
to
bugsey
she
said
and
that
make
it
kind
even
though
it
does
look
as
if
you
wuz
gettin
off
pretty
light
pearlie
struggled
with
her
hair
to
make
it
lie
down
and
act
dacint
but
the
image
that
looked
back
at
her
from
the
cracked
glass
was
not
encouraging
even
after
making
allowance
for
the
crack
but
she
comforted
herself
by
saying
sure
it
danny
she
wants
to
see
and
she
wo
be
lookin
much
at
me
anyway
then
the
question
arose
and
for
a
while
looked
serious
what
was
danny
to
wear
on
his
head
danny
had
no
cap
nor
ever
had
one
there
was
one
little
red
toque
in
the
house
that
patsey
wore
but
by
an
unfortunate
accident
it
had
that
very
morning
fallen
into
the
milk
pail
and
was
now
drying
on
the
oven
door
for
a
while
it
seemed
as
if
the
visit
would
have
to
be
postponed
until
it
dried
when
mary
had
an
inspiration
wrap
yer
cloud
around
his
head
and
say
you
wuz
feart
of
the
earache
the
day
is
so
cold
this
was
done
and
a
blanket
off
one
of
the
beds
was
pressed
into
service
as
an
outer
wrap
for
danny
he
was
in
such
very
bad
humour
at
being
wrapped
up
so
tight
that
pearlie
had
to
set
him
down
on
the
bed
again
to
get
a
fresh
grip
on
him
it
just
as
well
i
have
no
mitts
she
said
as
she
lifted
her
heavy
burden
i
could
howld
him
at
all
if
i
was
bothered
with
mitts
open
the
dure
patsey
and
mind
you
shut
it
tight
again
keep
up
the
fire
mary
bugsey
lie
still
and
chew
your
gum
and
do
fight
any
of
yez
when
pearlie
and
her
heavy
burden
arrived
at
francis
back
door
they
were
admitted
by
the
camilla
who
set
a
beside
the
kitchen
stove
for
pearlie
to
sit
in
while
she
unrolled
danny
and
when
danny
in
his
rather
remarkable
costume
stood
up
on
pearlie
knee
camilla
laughed
so
good
humouredly
that
danny
felt
the
necessity
of
showing
her
all
his
accomplishments
and
so
made
the
face
that
patsey
had
taught
him
by
drawing
down
his
eyes
and
putting
his
fingers
in
his
mouth
danny
thought
she
liked
it
very
much
for
she
went
hurriedly
into
the
pantry
and
brought
back
a
cookie
for
him
the
savoury
smell
of
fried
salmon
for
it
was
near
lunch
time
increased
danny
interest
in
his
surroundings
and
his
eyes
were
big
with
wonder
when
francis
herself
came
in
and
is
this
little
daniel
she
cried
rapturously
so
sweet
so
innocent
so
pure
did
big
sister
carry
him
all
the
way
kind
big
sister
does
oo
love
big
sister
nope
danny
spoke
up
quickly
just
like
chockaluts
how
sweet
of
him
is
it
really
she
said
with
the
world
all
before
him
the
great
untried
future
lying
vast
and
prophetic
waiting
for
his
baby
feet
to
enter
well
has
parker
said
little
child
is
a
bundle
of
possibilities
and
responsibilities
if
ye
please
pearlie
said
timidly
not
wishing
to
contradict
the
lady
but
still
anxious
to
set
her
right
it
was
just
this
blanket
i
had
him
rolled
in
at
which
camilla
again
retired
to
the
pantry
with
precipitate
haste
did
you
see
the
blue
blue
sky
daniel
and
the
white
white
snow
and
did
you
see
the
little
whirling
by
like
brown
leaves
francis
asked
with
an
air
of
great
childishness
nope
said
danny
shortly
did
see
nothin
please
began
pearlie
again
it
was
the
cloud
around
his
head
on
account
of
the
earache
that
done
it
it
is
sweet
to
look
into
his
innocent
young
eyes
and
wonder
what
visions
they
will
some
day
see
went
on
francis
dreamily
but
there
she
stopped
with
a
look
of
horror
frozen
on
her
face
for
at
the
mention
of
his
eyes
danny
remembered
his
best
trick
and
how
well
it
had
worked
on
camilla
and
in
a
flash
his
eyes
were
drawn
down
and
his
mouth
stretched
to
its
utmost
limit
what
ails
the
child
francis
cried
in
alarm
camilla
come
here
camilla
came
out
of
the
pantry
and
gazed
at
danny
with
sparkling
eyes
while
pearlie
on
the
verge
of
tears
vainly
tried
to
awaken
in
him
some
sense
of
the
shame
he
was
bringing
on
her
camilla
hurried
to
the
pantry
again
and
brought
another
cookie
i
believe
francis
that
danny
is
hungry
she
said
children
sometimes
act
that
way
she
added
laughing
really
how
very
interesting
i
must
see
if
parker
mentions
this
strange
phenomenon
in
his
book
please
i
think
i
had
better
take
him
home
now
said
pearlie
she
knew
what
danny
was
and
was
afraid
that
greater
disgrace
might
await
her
but
when
she
tried
to
get
him
back
into
the
blanket
he
lost
every
joint
in
his
body
and
slipped
to
the
floor
this
is
what
she
had
feared
danny
had
gone
limber
i
do
want
to
go
home
he
wailed
dismally
i
want
to
stay
with
her
and
her
want
to
see
the
yalla
burds
want
a
chockalut
come
danny
that
a
man
pleaded
pearlie
and
i
tell
you
all
about
the
lovely
pink
lady
when
we
go
home
and
i
get
bugsey
gum
for

and
i

roared

me
how
about
the
pink
lady

her
and
her
wait
till
we
get
home
danny
man
pearlie
grief
flowed
afresh
disgrace
had
fallen
on
the
watsons
and
pearlie
knew
it
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
what
mental
food
this
little
mind
has
been
receiving
please
do
tell
him
the
story
pearlie
thus
admonished
pearlie
with
flaming
cheeks
began
the
story
she
tried
to
make
it
less
personal
but
at
every
change
danny
screamed
his
disapproval
and
held
her
to
the
original
version
and
when
it
was
done
he
looked
up
with
his
sweet
little
smile
and
said
to
francis
nodding
his
head
you
it
you
the
lovely
pink
lady
there
was
a
strange
flush
on
francis
face
and
a
strange
feeling
stirring
her
heart
as
she
hurriedly
rose
from
her
chair
and
clasped
danny
in
her
arms
danny
danny
she
cried
you
shall
see
the
yellow
birds
and
the
stairs
and
the
chocolates
on
the
dresser
and
the
pink
lady
will
come
with
the
big
parcel
danny
little
arms
tightened
around
her
neck
it
her
he
shouted
it
her
when
burton
francis
went
up
to
her
a
few
hours
later
to
get
the
satchel
powder
to
put
in
the
box
that
was
to
be
tied
with
the
store
string
the
sun
was
shining
on
the
face
of
the
madonna
on
the
wall
and
it
seemed
to
smile
at
her
as
she
passed
the
little
red
book
lay
on
the
table
forgotten
she
tossed
it
into
the
basket
chapter

old

comfortable
home
stood
another
large
house
and
dreary
looking
a
house
whose
dilapidated
verandas
and
broken
fence
clearly
indicated
that
its
good
days
had
gone
by
in
the
vines
and
flowers
grew
around
it
to
hide
its
scars
and
relieve
its
grimness
pathetic
as
a
brave
smile
on
a
sad
face
barner
brilliant
witty
and
skilful
had
for
many
years
been
a
victim
of
intemperance
but
being
scotch
to
the
backbone
he
never
could
see
how
good
pure
kilmarnock
made
in
glasgow
could
hurt
anyone
he
knew
that
his
hand
shook
and
his
brain
reeled
and
his
eyes
were
bleared
but
he
never
blamed
the
whiskey
he
knew
that
his
patients
sometimes
died
while
he
was
enjoying
a
protracted
drunk
but
of
course
accidents
will
happen
and
a
doctor
accidents
are
soon
buried
and
forgotten
even
in
his
worst
moments
if
he
could
be
induced
to
come
to
the
sick
bed
he
would
sober
up
wonderfully
and
many
a
sufferer
was
relieved
from
pain
and
saved
from
death
by
his
gentle
and
skilful
though
trembling
hands
he
might
not
be
able
to
walk
across
the
room
but
he
could
diagnose
correctly
and
prescribe
successfully
when
he
came
to
millford
years
ago
his
practice
grew
rapidly
people
wondered
why
he
came
to
such
a
small
place
for
his
skill
his
wit
his
wonderful
presence
would
have
won
distinction
anywhere
his
wife
a
frail
though
very
beautiful
woman
at
first
thought
nothing
of
his
drinking
habits
he
was
never
anything
but
gentlemanly
in
her
presence
but
the
time
came
when
she
saw
honour
and
manhood
slowly
but
surely
dying
in
him
and
on
her
heart
there
fell
the
terrible
weight
of
a
powerless
despair
her
health
had
never
been
robust
and
she
quickly
sank
into
invalidism
the
specialist
who
came
from
winnipeg
diagnosed
her
case
as
chronic
anaemia
and
prescribed
port
wine
which
she
refused
with
a
queer
little
wavering
cry
and
a
sudden
rush
of
tears
but
she
put
up
a
good
fight
nevertheless
she
wanted
to
live
so
much
for
the
sake
of
mary
her
beautiful
daughter
barner
did
not
live
to
see
the
whole
work
of
degeneration
for
the
end
came
in
the
early
spring
swift
and
sudden
and
kind
the
doctor
grief
for
his
wife
was
sincere
he
always
referred
to
her
as
my
poor
mildred
and
never
spoke
of
her
except
when
comparatively
sober
mary
barner
took
up
the
burden
of
caring
for
her
father
without
question
for
she
loved
him
with
a
great
and
pitying
love
to
which
he
responded
in
his
best
moments
in
the
winter
she
went
with
him
on
his
drives
night
and
day
for
the
fear
of
what
might
happen
was
always
in
her
heart
she
was
his
housekeeper
his
his
bookkeeper
she
endured
all
things
loneliness
poverty
disgrace
without
complaining
or
bitterness
one
day
shortly
after
barner
death
big
john
robertson
from
the
hills
drove
furiously
down
the
street
to
the
doctor
house
and
rushed
into
the
office
without
ringing
the
bell
his
little
boy
had
been
cut
with
the
and
he
implored
the
doctor
to
come
at
once
the
doctor
sat
at
his
desk
just
drunk
enough
to
be
and
curtly
told
robertson
to
go
straight
to
perdition
and
as
the
poor
man
wild
with
excitement
begged
him
to
come
and
offered
him
money
he
yawned
nonchalantly
and
with
some
slight
variations
repeated
the
injunction
mary
hearing
the
conversation
came
in
hurriedly
mary
my
dear
the
doctor
said
please
leave
us
this
gentleman
is
quite
forgetting
himself
and
his
language
is
shocking
mary
did
not
even
look
at
her
father
she
was
packing
his
little
satchel
with
all
that
would
be
needed
now
pick
him
up
and
take
him
she
said
firmly
to
big
john
he
be
all
right
when
he
sees
your
little
boy
never
mind
what
he
says
now
big
john
seized
the
doctor
and
bore
him
struggling
and
protesting
to
the
wagon
the
doctor
made
an
effort
to
get
out
put
him
down
in
the
bottom
with
this
under
his
head
handing
big
john
a
cushion
and
put
your
feet
on
him
mary
commanded
big
john
did
as
she
bid
him
none
too
gently
for
he
could
still
hear
his
little
boy
cries
and
see
that
cruel
jagged
wound
oh
do
hurt
him
she
cried
piteously
and
ran
sobbing
into
the
house
upstairs
in
what
had
been
her
mother
room
she
pressed
her
face
against
her
mother
kimono
that
still
hung
behind
the
door
i
am
not
crying
for
you
to
come
back
mother
she
sobbed
bitterly
i
am
just
crying
for
your
little
girl
the
doctor
was
asleep
when
john
reached
his
little
shanty
in
the
hills
the
child
still
lived
his
highland
mother
having
stopped
the
blood
with
rude
bandaging
and
ashes
a
remedy
learned
in
her
island
home
john
shook
the
doctor
roughly
and
cursed
him
soundly
in
both
english
and
gaelic
without
avail
but
the
child
cry
so
full
of
pain
and
weakness
roused
him
with
a
start
in
a
minute
frederick
barner
was
himself
he
took
the
child
gently
from
his
mother
and
laid
him
on
the
bed
for
two
days
the
doctor
stayed
in
john
dirty
little
shanty
caring
for
little
murdock
as
tenderly
as
a
mother
he
cooked
for
the
child
he
sang
to
him
he
carried
him
in
his
arms
for
hours
and
soothed
him
with
a
hundred
quaint
fancies
he
superintended
the
cleaning
of
the
house
and
scolded
john
wife
soundly
on
her
shiftless
ways
he
showed
her
how
to
bake
bread
and
cook
little
dishes
to
tempt
the
child
appetite
winning
thereby
her
undying
gratitude
she
understood
but
little
of
the
scolding
but
she
saw
his
kindness
to
her
little
boy
for
kindness
is
the
same
in
all
languages
on
the
third
day
the
little
fellow
fever
went
down
and
peeping
over
the
doctor
shoulder
he
smiled
and
chattered
and
asked
for
his
daddy
and
his
mathar
then
big
john
broke
down
utterly
and
tried
to
speak
his
gratitude
but
the
doctor
abruptly
told
him
to
quit
his
blubbering
and
hitch
up
for
little
murdock
would
be
chasing
the
hens
again
in
a
week
or
two
the
doctor
went
faithfully
every
day
and
dressed
little
murdock
wound
until
it
no
longer
needed
his
care
remaining
perfectly
sober
meanwhile
hope
sprang
up
in
mary
heart
for
love
believeth
all
things
at
night
when
he
went
to
bed
and
she
carefully
locked
the
doors
and
took
the
keys
to
her
room
she
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
one
more
day
won
but
alas
for
mary
hopes
they
were
built
upon
the
slipping
sliding
sands
of
human
desire
one
night
she
found
him
in
the
office
of
the
hotel
a
senseless
gibbering
old
man
arguing
theology
with
a
brother
scotchman
who
was
in
the
same
condition
of
mellow
exhilaration
mary
white
face
as
she
guided
her
father
through
the
door
had
an
effect
upon
the
men
who
sat
around
the
office
fellows
they
were
and
they
felt
sorry
for
the
poor
little
motherless
girl
sorry
for
old
doc
too
one
after
another
they
went
home
feeling
just
a
little
ashamed
the
bartender
a
new
one
from
across
the
line
a
dapper
chap
with
diamonds
was
indignant
i
give
that
old
man
a
straight
pointer
he
said
that
his
girl
has
to
stay
out
of
here
this
is
no
place
for
women
anyway
which
is
true
god
knows
five
years
went
by
and
mary
barner
lived
on
in
the
lonely
house
and
did
all
that
human
power
could
do
to
stay
her
father
evil
course
but
the
years
told
heavily
upon
him
he
had
made
some
fatal
mistakes
in
his
prescribing
and
the
people
had
been
compelled
to
get
in
another
doctor
though
a
great
many
of
those
who
had
known
him
in
his
best
days
still
clung
to
the
old
man
in
spite
of
his
drinking
they
could
not
forget
how
he
had
fought
with
death
for
them
and
for
their
children
of
all
his
former
skill
but
little
remained
now
except
his
wonderful
presence
in
the
he
could
still
inspire
the
greatest
confidence
and
hope
still
at
his
coming
a
sick
man
fears
fell
away
from
him
and
in
their
stead
came
hope
and
good
cheer
this
was
the
old
man
good
gift
that
even
his
years
of
sinning
could
not
wholly
destroy
god
had
marked
him
for
a
great
physician
chapter
iii
the
pink
lady
when
francis
decided
to
play
the
lady
bountiful
to
the
watson
family
she
not
only
ministered
to
their
physical
necessity
but
she
conscientiously
set
about
to
do
them
good
if
they
would
be
done
good
to
francis
heart
was
kind
when
you
could
get
to
it
but
it
was
so
deeply
crusted
over
with
theories
and
reflections
and
abstract
truths
that
not
very
many
people
knew
that
she
had
one
when
little
danny
arms
were
thrown
around
her
neck
and
he
called
her
his
dear
sweet
pink
lady
her
broke
down
before
a
power
which
had
lain
dormant
she
had
always
talked
a
great
deal
of
the
joys
of
motherhood
and
the
rapturous
delights
of
not
many
of
the
mothers
knew
as
much
of
the
proper
care
of
an
infant
during
the
period
of
dentition
as
she
she
had
read
papers
at
meetings
and
was
as
full
of
health
talks
as
a
school
physiology
but
it
was
the
touch
of
danny
soft
cheek
and
clinging
arms
that
brought
to
her
the
rapture
that
is
so
sweet
it
hurts
and
she
realised
that
she
had
missed
the
sweetest
thing
in
life
a
tiny
flame
of
real
love
began
to
glimmer
in
her
heart
and
feebly
shed
its
beams
among
the
debris
of
cold
theories
and
sensations
that
had
filled
it
hitherto
she
worried
danny
with
her
attentions
although
he
tried
hard
to
put
up
with
them
she
was
the
lady
of
his
dreams
for
pearl
imagination
had
clothed
her
with
all
the
virtues
and
graces
hers
was
a
strangely
inconsistent
character
spiritually
minded
but
selfish
loving
humanity
when
it
is
spelled
with
a
capital
but
knowing
nothing
of
the
individual
the
flower
of
holiness
in
her
heart
was
like
the
haughty
orchid
that
blooms
in
the
hothouse
untouched
by
wind
or
cold
beautiful
to
behold
but
comforting
no
one
with
its
beauty
pearl
watson
was
like
the
rugged
little
anemone
the
wind
flower
that
lifts
its
head
from
the
cheerless
prairie
no
kind
hand
softens
the
heat
or
the
cold
nor
tempers
the
wind
and
yet
the
very
winds
that
blow
upon
it
and
the
hot
sun
that
beats
upon
it
bring
to
it
a
grace
a
hardiness
a
fragrance
of
good
cheer
that
gladdens
the
hearts
of
all
who
pass
that
way
francis
found
herself
strongly
attracted

a

with
a
woman
responsibility
appealed
to
francis
she
thought
about
pearl
very
often
noticing
one
day
that
pearl
was
thin
and
pale
she
decided
at
once
that
she
needed
a
health
talk
pearl
sat
like
a
graven
image
while
francis
conscientiously
tried
to
stir
up
in
her
the
seeds
of
right
living
oh
ma
pearl
said
to
her
mother
that
night
when
the
children
had
gone
to

and
they
were
sewing
by
the
fire
oh

cut

the

he
wo
let

she
hastily
worked
a

few
minutes
then

said
let
us
go
to
bed
now
ma
me
eyes
are
shuttin
go
back
and
ask
camilla
about
the
chapter
iv
the
band
of
hope
mary
barner
had
learned
the
lesson
early
that
the
only
easing
of
her
own
pain
was
in
helping
others
to
bear
theirs
and
so
it
came
about
that
there
was
perhaps
no
one
in
millford
more
beloved
than
she
perhaps
it
was
the
memory
of
her
own
lost
childhood
that
caused
her
heart
to
go
out
in
love
and
sympathy
to
every
little
boy
and
girl
in
the
village
their
joys
were
hers
their
sorrows
also
she
took
slivers
from
little
fingers
with
great
skill
beguiling
the
owners
thereof
with
wonderful
songs
and
stories
she
piloted
weary
little
plodders
through
pages
of
homework
she
mended
torn
pinnies
so
that
even
vigilant
mothers
never
knew
that
their
little
girls
had
jumped
the
fence
at
all
she
made
dresses
for
concerts
at
short
notice
she
appeased
angry
parents
and
many
a
time
prevented
the
fall
of
correction
rod
when
tommy
watson
beguiled
ignatius
mcsorley
to
leave
his
mother
door
and
go
swimming
in
the
river
promising
faithfully
to
button
up
his
back
ignatius
being
a
wise
child
who
knew
his
limitations
and
when
tommy
watson
forgot
that
promise
and
basely
deserted
ignatius
to
catch
on
the
back
of
a
buggy
that
came
along
the
river
road
leaving
his
unhappy
friend
clad
in
one
small
shirt
vainly
imploring
him
to
return
ignatius
could
not
go
home

his

know
that
he
had
again
yielded
to
the

so
it
was
to
the
barner
back

that
he
turned
his
guilty
steps
miss
barner
was
talking
to
a
patient
in
the
office
when
she
heard
a
small
voice
at
the
kitchen
door
full
of
distress
whimpering
please
miss
barner
i
in
a
bad
way
tommy
watson
said
he
help
me
and
he
never

went
quickly
and
there
on
the
doorstep
stood
a
tiny
cupid
in
tears
tightly
clasping
his
scanty
wardrobe
to
his
bosom
he
said
he
help
me
and
he
never
he
repeated
in
a
burst
of
rage
as
she
drew
him
in
hastily
never
mind
honey
she
said
struggling
to
control
her
laughter
just
wait
till
i

teacher
on
monday
afternoon
it
was
part
of
her
duty
to
go
around
and
help
the
busy
mothers
to
get
the
children
ready
for
the
meeting
she
also
took
her
turn
with
white
in
making
taffy
for
they
had
learned
that
when
temperance
sentiment
waned
taffy
with
nuts
in
it
had
a
wonderful
power
to
bind
and
hold
the
wavering
childish
heart
there
was
no
human
way
of
telling
a
taffy
day
the
only
sure
way
was
to
go
every
time
the
two
little
white
girls
always
knew
but
do
you
think
they
would
tell
not
they
there
was
secrecy
written
all
over
their
blond
faces
and
in
every
strand
of
their
hair
once
they
deliberately
stood
by
and
heard
minnie
mcsorley
and
mary
watson
plan
to
go
down
to
the
creamery
for
on
monday
afternoon
there
were
four
plates
of
taffy
on
their
mother
pantry
shelf
at
the
time
and
yet
they
gave
no
sign
minnie
mcsorley
and
mary
watson
went
blindly
on
and
reaped
a
harvest
of
regrets
there
was
no
use
offering
the
white
girls
anything
for
the
information
glass
alleys
paint
cards
or
even
popcorn
rings
were
powerless
to
corrupt
them
once
jimmy
watson
became
the
hero
of
an
hour
by
circulating
the
report
that
he
had
smelled
it
cooking
when
he
took
the
milk
to
miss
barner
but
alas
for
circumstantial
evidence
every
child
went
to
band
of
hope
that
monday
afternoon
eager
and
expectant
but
it
was
only
a
hard
lesson
on
the
effect
of
alcohol
on
the
lining
of
the
stomach
that
they
got
and
when
white
complimented
them
on
their
increased
attendance
and
gave
out
the
closing
hymn
oh
what
a
happy
band
are
we
the
hogan
twins
sobbed
when
the
meeting
was
over
miss
barner
exonerated
jimmy
by
saying
it
was
icing
for
a
cake
he
had
smelled
and
the
drooping
spirits
of
the
band
were
somewhat
revived
by
her
promise
that
next
monday
would
surely
be
taffy
day
on
the
last
monday
of
each
month
the
band
of
hope
had
a
programme
instead
of
the
regular
lesson
before
the
programme
was
given
the
children
were
allowed
to
tell
stories
or
ask
questions
relating
to
temperance
the
hogan
twins
were
always
full
of
communications
and
on
this
particular
monday
it
looked
as
if
they
would
swamp
the
meeting
william
henry
hogan
commonly
known
as
squirt
told
to
a
dot
how
many
pairs
of
shoes
and
bags
of
flour
a
man
could
buy
by
denying
himself
cigars
for
ten
years
during
william
henry
recital
john
james
hogan
the
other
twin
showed
unmistakable
signs
of
impatience
he
stood
up
and
waved
his
hand
so
violently
that
he
seemed
to
be
in
danger
of
throwing
that
useful
member
away
forever
white
gave
him
permission
to
speak
as
soon
as
his
brother
had
finished
and
john
james
announced
with
a
burst
of
importance
please
teacher
my
pa
came
home
last
night
full
as
a
miss
barner
put
her
hand
hastily
over
her
eyes
white
gasped
and
the
band
of
hope
held
its
breath
then
white
hurriedly
announced
that
master
james
watson
would
recite
and
jimmy
went
forward
with
great
outward
composure
and
recited
as
i
was
going
to
the
lake
i
met
a
little
rattlesnake
i
fed
him
with
some
which
made
his
little
but
white
interrupted
jimmy
just
then
by
saying
that
she
must
insist
on
temperance
selections
at
these
programmes
whereat
pearlie
watson
hand
waved
appealingly
and
miss
barner
gave
her
permission
to
speak
please
pearl
said
addressing
white
jimmy
and
me
thought
anything
about
a
rattlesnake
would
do
for
a
temperance
piece
and
if
you
had
only
let
jimmy
go
on
you
would
have
seen
what
happened
even
a
snake
that
et
what
he
had
ought
to
and
please
jimmy
and
me
thought
it
might
be
a
good
lesson
for
all
of
us
miss
barner
thought
that
pearlie
point
was
well
taken
and
took
jimmy
with
her
into
the
vestry
from
which
he
emerged
a
few
minutes
later
flushed
and
triumphant
and
recited
the
same
selection
with
a
possible
change
of
text
in
one
place
as
i
was
going
to
the
lake
i
met
a
little
rattlesnake
i
fed
him
on
some
which
made
his
little
stomach
ache
the
musical
committee
then
sang
we
for
home
and
mother
god
and
native
land
grown
up
friend
and
brother
give
us
now
your
hand
and
won
loud
applause
little
sissy
moore
knew
only
the
first
verse
but
it
would
never
have
been
known
that
she
was
saying
dum
dum
dum
dum
dum
dum
dum
dum
if
mary
simpson
had
told
wilford
ducker
starched
as
stiff
as
boiled
and
raw
starch
could
make
him
recited
perish
king
alcohol
we
will
grow
up
but
was
accorded
a
very
indifferent
reception
by
the
band
of
hopers
wilford
was
allowed
to
go
to
band
of
hope
only
when
miss
barner
went
for
him
and
escorted
him
home
again
ducker
had
been
very
particular
about
wilford
from
the
first
then
the
white
girls
recited
a
strictly
suitable
piece
it
was
entitled
the
world
and
the
conscience
lily
represented
a
vain
woman
of
the
world
bent
upon
pleasure
with
a
tendency
toward
liquid
refreshment
her
innocent
eyes
and
flaxen
braids
were
in
strange
contrast
to
the
mad
love
of
glittering
wealth
which
was
supposed
to
fill
her
heart
give
to
me
the
flowing
bowl
and
pleasure
glittering
crown
the
path
of
pride
shall
be
my
goal
and
conscience
voice
i
drown
then
blanche
sweetly
admonished
her
oh
lay
aside
your
idle
boasts
no
pleasure
thus
you
find
the
flowing
bowl
a
serpent
is
to
poison
soul
and
mind
oh
sign
our
pledge
while
yet
you
can
nor
look
upon
the
wine
when
it
is
red
within
the
cup
let
not
its
curse
be
thine
thereupon
the
frivolous
creature
repents
of
her
waywardness
and
the
two
little
girls
join
hands
and
recite
in
unison
we
will
destroy
this
giant
king
and
drive
him
from
our
land
and
on
the
side
of
we
surely
take
our
stand
and
the
piece
was
over
robert
roblin
watson
otherwise
known
as
bugsey
who
had
that
very
day
been
installed
as
a
member
of
the
band
of
hope
after
he
had
avowed
his
determination
never
to
touch
taste
nor
handle
alcoholic
stimulants
in
any
form
as
a
beverage
and
to
discourage
all
traffic
in
the
same
was
the
next
gentleman
on
the
programme
pearlie
was
sure
selection
was
suitable
she
whispered
to
him
the
very
last
minute
not
to
forget
his
bow
but
he
did
forget
it
and
was
off
like
a
shot
into
his
piece
i
belong
to
the
band
of
hope
never
to
drink
and
never
to
smoke
to
love
my
parents
and
uncle
sam
keep
alcohol
out
of
my
diaphragm
to
say
my
prayers
when
i
go
to
bed
and
not
put
the
bedclothes
over
my
head
fill
up
my
lungs
with
oxygen
and
be
kind
to
every
living
thing
there
i
guess
there
ca
be
no
kick
about
that
pearl
thought
to
herself
as
bugsey
finished
and
the
applause
rang
out
loud
and
louder
pearlie
had
forgotten
to
tell
bugsey
to
come
down
when
he
was
done
and
so
he
stood
irresolute
as
the
applause
grew
more
and
more
deafening
pearl
beckoned
and
waved
and
at
last
got
him
safely
landed
and
when
white
announced
that
was
taffy
day
owing
to
miss
kindness
bugsey
cup
of
happiness
was
full
miss
barner
said
she
had
an
extra
big
piece
for
the
youngest
member
master
danny
watson
pearlie
had
not
allowed
any
person
to
mention
taffy
to
him
because
danny
could
not
bear
to
be
disappointed
but
there
were
no
disappointments
that
day
taffy
enough
for
every
one
taffy
slabs
with
nuts
in
it
cream
taffy
in
luscious
nuggets
curly
twists
of
brown
and
yellow
taffy
oh
look
another
plateful
and
it
coming
this
way
have
some
more
danny
oh
take
a
bigger
piece
there
lots
of
it
was
it
a
dream
when
the
last
little
band
of
hoper
had
left
the
vestry
mary
barner
sat
alone
with
her
thoughts
looking
with
unseeing
eyes
at
the
red
and
silver
mottoes
on
the
wall
pledge
cards
which
the
children
had
signed
were
gaily
strung
together
with
ribbons
across
the
wall
behind
her
she
was
thinking
of
the
little
people
who
had
just
gone
how
would
it
be
with
them
in
the
years
to
come
they
were
so
sweet
and
pure
and
lovely
now
unconsciously
she
bowed
her
head
on
her
hands
and
a
cry
quivered
from
her
heart
the
yellow
sunlight
made
a
ripple
of
golden
water
on
the
wall
behind
her
and
threw
a
wavering
radiance
on
her
soft
brown
hair
it
was
at
that
moment
that
the
rev
hugh
grantley
the
new
presbyterian
minister
opened
the
vestry
door
chapter
v
the
relict
of
the
late
mcguire
close
beside
the
watson
estate
with
its
strangely
shaped
dwelling
stood
another
small
house
which
was
the
earthly
abode
of
one
mcguire
also
of
irish
extraction
who
had
been
a
widow
for
forty
years
mcguire
was
a
tall
angular
woman
with
piercing
black
eyes
and
a
firm
forbidding
jaw
one
look
at
mcguire
usually
made
a
book
agent
forget
the
name
of
his
book
when
she
shut
her
mouth
no
lips
were
visible
her
upturned
nose
seemed
seriously
to
contemplate
running
up
under
her
sun
bonnet
to
escape
from
this
wicked
world
with
all
its
troubling
and
especially
from
john
watson
his
wife
and
his
family
of
nine
one
fruitful
cause
of
dispute
between
mcguire
and
the
watsons
was
the
boundary
line
between
the
two
estates
in
the
spring
watson
and
the
boys
put
up
a
fence
of
green
poplar
poles
where
they
thought
the
fence
should
be
hoping
that
it
might
serve
the
double
purpose
of
dividing
the
lots
and
be
a
social
barrier
between
them
and
the
relict
of
the
late
mcguire
the
relict
watched
and
waited
and
said
not
a
word
but
it
was
the
ominous
silence
that
comes
before
the
hail
mcguire
hated
the
watson
family
collectively
but
it
was
upon
john
watson
the
man
of
few
words
that
she
lavished
the
whole
wealth
of
her
south
of
ireland
hatred
for
john
watson
had
on
more
than
one
occasion
got
the
better
of
her
in
a
wordy
encounter
one
time
when
the
boundary
dispute
was
at
its
height
she
had
burst
upon
john
as
he
went
to
his
work
in
the
morning
with
a
storm
of
and
comprehensive
epithets
she
gave
him
the
history
of
the
watson
family
past
present
and
future
especially
the
future
every
watson
that
ever
left
ireland
came
in
for
a
brief
but
pungent
notice
john
stood
thoughtfully
rubbing
his
chin
and
when
she
stopped
not
from
lack
of
words
but
from
lack
of
breath
he
slowly
remarked
mistress
mcguire
yer
a
lady
yer
a
liar
she
snapped
back
with
a
still
more
eloquent
burst
of
invectives
john
lighted
his
pipe
with
great
deliberation
and
when
it
was
drawing
nicely
he
took
it
from
his
mouth
and
said
more
to
himself
than
to
her
stay
where
ye
are
pat
mcguire
it
may
be
hot
where
ye
are
but
it
would
be
hotter
for
ye
if
ye
were
here
and
ye
jist
have
the
throuble
o
movin
stay
where
ye
are
pat
wherever
ye
are
he
walked
away
leaving
mcguire
with
the
uncomfortable
feeling
that
he
had
some
way
got
the
best
of
her
the
watsons
had
planted
their
potatoes
beside
the
fence
and
did
not
dream
of
evil
but
one
morning
in
the
early
autumn
the
earliest
little
watson
who
went
out
to
get
a
basin
of
water
out
of
the
rain
barrel
to
wash
the
sleeps
out
of
his
eyes
dropped
the
basin
in
his
astonishment
for
the
fence
was
gone
it
was
removed
to
woodpile
and
the
lady
herself
was
industriously
digging
the
potatoes
bugsey
for
he
was
the
early
little
bird
ran
back
into
the
house
screaming
she
robbed
us
she
robbed
us
and
tuk
our
fence
the
watson
family
gathered
as
quickly
as
a
fire
brigade
at
the
sound
of
the
gong
but
in
the
scramble
for
garments
some
were
less
fortunate
than
others
wee
tommy
who
was
a
little
heavier
sleeper
than
the
others
could
find
nothing
to
put
on
but
one
overshoe
and
an
old
chest
protector
of
his
mother
but
he
arrived
at
the
front
nevertheless
tommy
was
not
the
boy
to
desert
his
family
for
any
minor
consideration
such
as
clothes
mcguire
leaned
on
her
hoe
and
nonchalantly
regarded
the
gathering
forces
she
had
often
thought
out
the
scene
and
her
air
of
indifference
was
somewhat
overdone
the
fence
was
on
her
ground
so
it
was
and
so
were
two
rows
of
the
potatoes
she
could
do
what
she
liked
with
her
own
so
she
could
she
did
ask
them
to
plant
potatoes
on
her
ground
if
they
wanted
to
stand
there
gawkin
at
her
they
wur
welcome
she
always
did
like
but
she
was
afraid
the
childer
would
catch
cowld
they
were
dressed
so
loight
for
so
late
in
the
season
she
picked
up
the
last
pailful
as
she
spoke
and
retired
into
her
own
house
leaving
the
watson
family
to
do
the
same
watson
counselled
peace
john
ate
his
breakfast
in
silence
but
the
young
watsons
and
even
pearlie
thirsted
for
revenge
bugsey
watson
forgot
his
band
of
hope
teaching
of
returning
good
for
evil
and
standing
on
the
disputed
territory
he
planted
his
little
bare
legs
far
apart
and
shouted
dancing
up
and
down
to
the
rhythm
chew
tobacco
chew
tobacco
spit
spit
spit
old
mcguire
old
mcguire
nit
nit
nit
mcguire
did
occasionally
draw
comfort
from
an
old
clay
pipe
but
bugsey
punishment
was
near
a
long
shadow
fell
upon
him
and
turning
around
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
mary
barner
who
stood
spellbound
listening
to
her
lately
installed
band
of
hoper
bugsey
downfall
was
complete
he
turned
and
ran
down
the
road
and
round
behind
an
elevator
where
half
an
hour
later
pearl
found
him
shedding
penitential
tears
not
alas
because
he
had
sinned
but
because
he
had
been
found
out
the
maternal
instinct
was
strong
in
pearlie
bugsey
in
tears
was
in
need
of
consolation
bugsey
was
always
in
need
of
admonition
so
she
combined
them
do
cry
alannah
maybe
miss
barner
did
hear
yez

all

all

mind
that
a
soft
answer

away

and
forbye
makes
them
madder
than

say
to
them
bugsey
tearfully
declared
he
would
never
go
to
band
of
hope
again
taffy
or
no

could
not
bear
to

very
one
i
git
to
help
me
to
give
me
a
with
him
into
the
river
she
that
good
and
swate
the
subject
of
this
doubtful
compliment
had
come
down
so
early
that
morning
believing
that
mcguire
was
confined
to
her
bed
with
rheumatism
seeing
the
object
of
her
solicitude
up
and
about
she
would
have
returned
without
knowing
what
had
happened
but
remarkable
musical
turn
decided
her
that
mcguire
was
suffering
from
worse
than
a
rheumatic
knee
she
went
into
the
little
house
and
heard
all
about
it
when
she
went
home
a
little
later
she
found
robert
roblin
watson
with
resolute
heart
but
hanging
head
waiting
for
her
on
the
back
step
what
passed
between
them
neither
of
them
ever
told
but
in
a
very
few
minutes
robert
roblin
ran
gaily
homeward
happy
in
heart
shriven
of
his
sin
and
with
one
little
spot
on
his
cheek
which
tingled
with
rapture
better
still
he
went
like
a
man
and
made
his
peace
with
mcguire
chapter
vi
the
musical
sense
francis
in
the
sweetest
of
tea
gowns
was
intent
upon
ernestus
parker
book
on
purposeful
motherhood
it
was
the
chapter
dealing
with
the
musical
sense
in
children
which
engrossed
francis
attention
she
had
just
begun
subdivision
c
in
the
chapter
when
and
how
the
musical
sense
is
developed
when
she
thought
of
danny
she
fished
into
the
basket
for
her
little
red
and
with
her
silver
mounted
pencil
she
made
the
following
entry
daniel
watson
aged
mus
sense
developed
if
so
when
if
not
how
and
at
once
she
read
on
feverishly
she
felt
herself
to
be
in
the
throes
of
a
great
idea
then
she
called
camilla
camilla
is
always
so
practical
she
thought
to
camilla
she
elaborated
the
vital
points
of
parker
theory
of
the
awakening
of
the
musical
sense
reading
here
and
there
from
the
book
rapidly
and
unintelligibly
she
was
so
excited
she
was
incoherent
camilla
listened
patiently
although
her
thoughts
were
with
her
biscuits
in
the
oven
below
and
now
camilla
she
said
when
she
had
gone
all
over
the
subject
how
can
we
awaken
the
musical
sense
in
daniel
you
know
i
value
your
opinion
so
much
camilla
was
ready
take
him
to
hear
professor
welsman
play
she
said
the
professor
will
give
his
recital
here
on
the
francis
wrote
rapidly
i
believe
she
said
looking
up
your
suggestion
is
a
good
one
you
shall
have
the
credit
of
it
in
my
notes
plan
of
awakening
mus
sense
suggested
by
c
camilla
smiled
thank
you
francis
you
are
very
kind
when
camilla
went
back
to
the
kitchen
and
took
the
biscuits
from
the
oven
she
laughed
softly
to
herself
this
is
going
to
be
a
good
time
for
some
further
suggestions
pearl
must
go
with
danny
what
a
treat
it
will
be
for
poor
little
pearl
then
we
must
have
a
new
suit
for
danny
new
dress
for
pearl
new
cap
for
new
hat
for
all
suggested
by
there
are
a
few
suggestions
which
will
certainly
make
on
the
evening
of
the
professor
recital
there
were
no
two
happier
people
in
the
audience
than
pearlie
watson
and
her
brother
daniel
mulcahey
watson
not
because
the
great
professor
was
about
to
interpret
for
them
the
music
of
the
masters
that
was
not
the
cause
of
their
happiness
but
because
of
the
good
supper
they
had
had
and
the
good
clothes
they
wore
their
hearts
were
glad
they
had
spent
the
afternoon
at
francis
suggested
by
danny
new
coat
had
a
velvet
collar
lovely
to
feel
suggested
by
pearl
had
a
wonderful
new
dress
the
kind
she
had
often
dreamed
of
made
out
of
one
of
francis
tea
gowns
not
only
suggested
but
made
by
it
had
real
buttons
on
it
and
there
was
not
one
pin
needed
pearl
felt
she
was
just
as
well
dressed
as
the
little
girl
on
the
starch
box
her
only
grief
was
that
when
she
had
on
her
coat
which
was
also
new
and
represented
month
of
camilla
wages
the
velvet
on
her
dress
did
not
show
but
camilla
anticipating
this
difficulty
laid
back
the
fronts
in
stunning
lapels
and
to
complete
the
arrangement
put
one
of
her
own
lace
collars
around
the
neck
of
the
coat
the
ends
coming
down
over
the
fronts
when
pearl
looked
in
the
glass
she
could
not
believe
her
eyes
francis
did
not
attend
piano
recitals
nor
the
meetings
of
the
browning
club
francis
was
often
deeply
grieved
with
james
for
his
indifference
in
regard
to
these
matters
but
the
musical
sense
in
james
continued
to
slumber
and
sleep
the
piano
recital
by
professor
welsman
was
given
under
the
auspices
of
the
ladies
aid
of
the
methodist
church
the
proceeds
to
be
given
toward
defraying
the
cost
of
the
repairs
on
the
parsonage
the
professor
was
to
be
assisted
by
local
talent
it
said
on
the
programmes
pearl
was
a
little
bit
disappointed
about
the
programmes
she
had
told
danny
that
there
would
be
a
chairman
who
would
say
i
see
the
first
item
on
this
here
programme
is
remarks
by
the
chair
but
as
yez
all
know
i
ai
no
hand
at
makin
a
speech
we
pass
on
to
the
next
item
but
there
was
not
a
sign
of
a
chairman
not
even
a
chair
the
people
just
came
up
themselves
without
anybody
telling
them
and
did
their
piece
and
went
back
it
looked
sort
of
bold
to
pearl
first
the
choir
came
in
and
sang
praise
waiteth
for
thee
o
lord
in
zion
pearl
did
not
like
the
way
they
treated
her
friend
clay
twice
when
he
began
to
sing
a
little
piece
by
himself
doing
all
right
too
two
or
three
of
them
broke
in
on
him
and
took
the
words
right
out
of
his
mouth
pearl
had
seen
people
get
slapped
faces
for
things
like
that
pearl
thought
it
just
served
them
right
when
the
doctor
stopped
singing
and
let
them
have
it
their
own
way
when
the
professor
came
up
the
aisle
everybody
leaned
forward
to
have
a
good
look
at
him
he
is
just
like
folks
only
for
his
hair
pearl
thought
pearl
lifted
danny
on
her
knee
and
told
him
to
look
alive
now
she
knew
what
they
were
there
for
then
the
professor
began
to
play
indifferently
at
first
after
the
manner
of
his
kind
clever
gymnastics
to
limber
up
his
fingers
perhaps
and
perhaps
to
show
how
limber
they
are
runs
and
trills
brilliant
execution
one
hand
after
the
other
in
mad
pursuit
crossing
over
back
again
up
and
down
in
the
vain
endeavour
to
come
up
with
the
other
hand
crescendo
diminuendo
trills
again
danny
yawned
widely
when
he
goin
to
begin
he
asked
sleepily
francis
watched
danny
eagerly
the
musical
sense
was
liable
to
wake
up
any
minute
but
it
would
have
to
hurry
for
daniel
mulcahey
was
liable
to
go
to
sleep
any
minute
pearl
was
disgusted
with
the
professor
and
her
thoughts
fell
into
vulgar
baseball
slang
playin
to
the
grand
stand
ai
ye
instead
o
gettin
down
to
work
that
do
for
ketch
and
toss
play
the
game
deliver
the
goods
then
the
professor
began
the
full
arm
chords
with
sudden
fury
writhing
upon
the
stool
as
he
struck
the
angry
notes
from
the
piano
indignation
ran
high
he
lost
his
head
he
up
in
the
air
she
shouted
but
the
words
were
lost
in
the
clang
of
musical
discords
but
wait
pearl
sat
still
and
listened
there
was
something
doing
it
was
a
welsh
rhapsodie
that
he
was
playing
it
was
all
there
the
mountains
and
the
rivers
and
the
towering
cliffs
with
glimpses
of
the
sea
where
waves
foam
on
the
rocks
and
wheel
and
scream
in
the
wind
and
then
a
bit
of
homely
melody
as
the
country
folk
drive
home
in
the
moonlight
singing
as
only
the
welsh
can
sing
the
songs
of
the
heart
songs
of
love
and
home
songs
of
death
and
sorrowing
that
stab
with
sudden
sweetness
a
child
cries
somewhere
in
the
dark
cries
for
his
mother
who
will
come
no
more
then
a
burst
of
patriotic
fire
as
the
people
fling
defiance
at
the
conquering
foe
and
hold
the
mountain
passes
till
the
last
man
falls
but
the
glory
of
the
fight
and
the
march
of
many
feet
trail
off
into
a
wailing
chant
the
death
song
of
the
brave
men
who
have
died
the
widow
mourns
and
the
little
children
weep
comfortless
in
their
mountain
home
and
the
wind
rushes
through
the
forest
and
the
river
foams
furiously
down
the
mountain
falling
in
billows
of
lace
over
the
rocks
and
the
sun
shines
over
all
cold
and
pitiless
why
pearlie
watson
what
are
you
crying
for
francis
whispered
severely
pearl
sobs
had
disturbed
her
danny
lay
asleep
on
knees
and
her
tears
fell
fast
on
his
tangled
curls
i
ai
cryin
i
ai
cryin
a
bit
you
leave
me
alone
pearl
blubbered
rudely
shaking
off
mrs
francis
shapely
hand
francis
was
shocked
what
in
the
world
was
making
pearl
cry
the
next
morning
francis
took
out
her
little
red
book
to
enter
the
result
of
her
experiment
and
sat
looking
long
and
earnestly
at
its
pages
then
she
drew
a
writing
pad
toward
her
and
wrote
an
illuminative
article
on
late
hours
a
frequent
and
fruitful
cause
of
irritability
in
children
chapter
vii
one
of
manitoba
prosperous
farmers
samuel
motherwell
was
a
wealthy
farmer
who
lived
a
few
miles
from
millford
photographs
of
motherwell
premises
may
be
seen
in
the
agricultural
journals
machinery
catalogues
advertisements
for
woven
wire
the
home
of
one
of
manitoba
prosperous
farmers
the
farm
buildings
were
in
good
repair
a
large
red
barn
with
white
trimmings
surmounted
by
a
creaking
windmill
a
long
low
machine
shed
filled
with
binders
seeders
everything
that
is
needed
for
the
and
harvest
and
all
that
lies
between
a
large
stone
house
square
and
gray
lonely
and
bare
without
a
tree
or
a
shrub
around
it
motherwell
did
not
like
vines
or
trees
around
a
house
they
were
apt
to
attract
lightning
and
bring
vermin
potatoes
grew
from
the
road
to
the
house
and
around
the
front
door
as
high
as
the
veranda
weeds
flourished
in
abundance
undisturbed
and
unnoticed
behind
the
cookhouse
a
bed
of
poppies
flamed
scarlet
against
the
general
sombreness
and
gave
a
strange
touch
of
colour
to
the
common
grayness
they
seemed
out
of
place
in
the
busy
farmyard
everything
else
was
there
for
use
everybody
hurried
but
the
poppies
idlers
of
precious
time
suggestive
of
slothful
sleep
they
held
up
their
brazen
faces
in
careless
indifference
sam
had
not
planted
them
you
may
be
sure
of
that
motherwell
would
tell
you
of
an
english
girl
she
had
had
to
work
for
her
that
summer
who
had
brought
the
seed
with
her
from
england
and
of
how
one
day
when
she
sent
the
girl
to
weed
the
onions
she
had
found
her
blubbering
and
crying
over
what
looked
to
motherwell
nothing
more
than
weeds
the
girl
then
told
her
she
had
brought
the
seed
with
her
and
planted
it
there
she
was
the
craziest
thing
this
polly
bragg
she
went
every
night
to
see
them
because
they
were
like
a
bit
of
home
she
said
motherwell
would
tell
you
just
what
a
ridiculous
creature
she
was
i
never
see
the
beat
o
that
girl
motherwell
would
say
them
eyes
of
hers
were
always
red
with
homesickness
and
there
was
no
reason
for
it
in
the
world
her
gettin
more
wages
than
she
ever
got
before
and
she
was
earnin
as
i
often
told
her
land
the
way
that
girl
would
sing
when
she
had
got
a
letter
from
home
the
queerest
songs
ye
ever
heard
down
by
the
biller
there
grew
a
green
willer
weeping
all
night
with
the
bank
for
a
piller
well
i
had
to
stop
her
at
last
motherwell
would
tell
you
with
an
apologetic
swallow
which
showed
that
even
generous
people
have
to
be
firm
sometimes
in
the
discharge
of
unpleasant
duties
and
mind
you
motherwell
would
go
on
with
a
grieved
air
just
as
the
busy
time
came
on
did
she
up
and
take
the
fever
you
never
can
depend
on
them
english
girls
and
when
the
doctor
was
outside
there
in
the
buggy
waitin
for
her
he
took
her
to
the
hospital
i
declare
if
we
did
find
her
blubberin
over
them
poppies
and
not
a
flower
on
them
no
mor
nothing
sam
motherwell
and
his
wife
were
nominally
presbyterians
at
the
time
that
the
millford
presbyterian
church
was
built
sam
had
given
dollars
toward
it
the
money
having
been
secured
in
some
strange
way
by
the
wiles
of
purvis
thomas
the
collector
everybody
was
surprised
at
sam
prodigality
the
next
year
a
new
collector
for
purvis
thomas
had
gone
away
called
on
motherwell
the
grain
was
just
beginning
to
show
a
slight
tinge
of
gold
it
was
one
of
those
cloudless
sunshiny
days
in
the
beginning
of
august
when
a
faint
blue
haze
lies
on
the
tiger
hills
and
the
joy
of
being
alive
swells
in
the
breast
of
every
living
thing
the
creek
swollen
with
the
july
rain
ran
full
in
its
narrow
channel
sparkling
and
swirling
over
its
gravelly
bed
and
on
the
green
meadow
below
the
house
a
herd
of
shorthorns
contentedly
cropped
the
tender
in
the
farmyard
a
gigantic
marched
majestically
with
arched
neck
and
spreading
wings
feeling
himself
very
much
the
king
of
the
castle
ducks
puddled
contentedly
in
a
trough
of
dirty
water
pigeons
white
winged
and
graceful
circled
and
wheeled
in
the
sunshine
hens
strutted
and
scratched
and
gossiped
openly
of
mysterious
nests
hidden
away
sam
stood
leaning
on
a
pitchfork
in
front
of
the
barn
door
he
was
a
stout
man
of
about
fifty
years
of
age
with
an
face
his
countenance
showed
the
sullen
stolidity
of
a
man
who
spoke
little
but
listened
always
of
a
man
who
indulged
in
suspicious
thoughts
he
knew
everything
about
his
neighbours
good
and
bad
he
might
forget
the
good
but
never
the
evil
the
tragedies
the
sins
the
misdeeds
of
thirty
years
ago
were
as
fresh
in
his
memory
as
the
scandal
of
yesterday
no
man
had
ever
been
tempted
beyond
his
strength
but
sam
motherwell
knew
the
manner
of
his
undoing
he
extended
no
mercy
to
the
fallen
he
suggested
no
excuse
for
the
erring
the
collector
made
known
his
errand
sam
became
animated
at
once
what
he
cried
angrily
ai
that
blamed
thing
paying
yet
i
a
good
notion
to
pull
my
money
out
of
it
and
be
done
with
it
what
do
you
take
me
for
anyway
the
collector
ventured
to
call
his
attention
to
his
prosperous
surroundings
and
evident
wealth
that
like
you
town
fellows
he
said
indignantly
you
never
think
of
the
hired
help
and
twine
bills
and
what
it
costs
to
run
a
place
like
this
i
pay
every
time
i
go
anyway
there
ai
a
time
that
i
let
the
plate
go
by
me
when
i
there
by
gosh
you
seem
to
think
money
to
burn
the
collector
departed
the
next
time
sam
went
to
millford
he
was
considerably
surprised
to
have
the
young
minister
the
reverend
hugh
grantley
stop
him
on
the
street
and
hand
him
dollars
i
understand
sir
that
you
wish
to
withdraw
the
money
that
you
invested
in
the
lord
work
he
said
as
he
handed
the
money
to
sam
whose
fingers
mechanically
closed
over
the
bills
as
he
stared
at
the
young
man
the
rev
hugh
grantley
was
a
typical
scotchman
tall
and
broad
shouldered
with
an
eye
like
cold
steel
not
many
people
had
contradicted
the
rev
hugh
grantley
at
least
to
his
face
his
voice
could
be
as
sweet
as
the
ripple
of
a
mountain
stream
or
vibrate
with
the
thunder
of
the
surf
that
beats
upon
his
own
granite
cliffs
the
lord
sends
you
and
harvest
he
said
fixing
his
level
gray
eye
on
the
other
man
who
somehow
avoided
his
gaze
has
given
you
health
of
body
and
mind
sends
you
rain
from
heaven
makes
his
sun
to
shine
upon
you
increases
your
riches
from
year
to
year
you
have
given
him
dollars
in
return
and
you
regret
it
is
that
so
i
do
know
that
i
just
said
that
the
other
man
stammered
i
see
no
need
of
these
fine
churches
and
paid
preachers
it
is
them
as
goes
to
church
most
that
is
the
best
oh
i
see
the
young
man
said
you
would
prefer
to
give
your
money
for
the
relief
of
the
poor
for
hospitals
or
children
homes
or
something
like
that
is
that
so
i
do
know
as
there
any
reason
for
me
givin
up
the
money
i
work
hard
for
sam
was
touched
on
a
vital
spot
well
i
tell
you
the
reason
the
minister
said
his
voice
was
no
louder
but
it
fell
with
a
emphasis
he
moved
a
step
nearer
his
companion
and
some
way
caught
and
held
his
wavering
vision
god
owns
of
all
that
stuff
you
call
your
own
you
have
cheated
him
out
of
his
part
all
these
years
and
he
has
carried
you
over
from
year
to
year
hoping
that
you
will
pay
up
without
harsh
proceedings
you
are
a
rich
man
in
this
world
goods
but
your
soul
is
lean
and
hungry
and
naked
selfishness
and
greed
have
blinded
your
eyes
if
you
could
see
what
a
contemptible
creature
you
are
in
god
sight
you
would
call
on
the
hills
to
fall
on
you
why
man
i
rather
take
my
chances
with
the
gambler
the
felon
the
drunkard
than
with
you
they
may
have
fallen
in
a
moment
of
strong
temptation
but
you
are
a
respectable
man
merely
because
it
costs
money
to
be
otherwise
the
lord
can
do
without
your
money
do
not
think
for
a
minute
that
god
work
will
not
go
on
shall
have
dominion
from
sea
to
sea
but
what
of
you
you
shall
lie
down
and
die
like
the
dog
you
shall
go
out
into
outer
darkness
the
world
will
not
be
one
bit
better
because
you
have
passed
through
it
sam
was
incoherent
with
rage
see
here
he
sputtered
what
do
you
know
about
it
i
pay
my
debts
everybody
knows
that
hold
on
hold
on
the
young
man
said
gently
you
pay
the
debts
that
the
law
compels
you
to
pay
you
have
to
pay
your
hired
help
and
your
threshing
bills
and
all
that
because
you
would
be
if
you
did
there
is
one
debt
that
is
left
to
a
man
honour
the
debt
he
owes
to
god
and
to
the
poor
and
the
needy
do
you
pay
that
debt
well
you
never
get
a
cent
out
of
me
anyway
you
have
a
mighty
poor
way
of
asking
for
money
maybe
if
you
had
taken
me
the
right
way
you
might
have
got
some
excuse
me
motherwell
the
young
man
replied
with
unaffected
good
humour
i
did
not
ask
you
for
money
at
all
i
gave
you
back
what
you
did
give
no
member
of
our
congregation
will
ask
you
for
any
though
there
may
come
a
time
when
you
will
ask
us
to
take
it
sam
motherwell
broke
into
a
scornful
laugh
and
turning
away
went
angrily
down
the
street
the
fact
that
the
minister
had
given
him
back
his
money
was
a
severe
shock
to
some
of
his
opinions
he
had
always
regarded
churches
as
greedy
institutions
looking
and
begging
for
money
from
everyone
ministers
as
parasites
on
society
living
without
honest
labour
preying
on
the
working
man
favourite
story
was
the
old
one
about
the
woman
whose
child
got
a
coin
stuck
in
its
throat
she
did
not
send
for
the
doctor
but
for
the
minister
sam
had
always
seen
considerable
truth
in
this
story
and
had
told
it
to
every
minister
he
had
met
he
told
himself
now
that
he
was
glad
to
get
back
the
money
dollars
was
not
picked
up
every
day
but
he
was
not
glad
the
very
touch
of
the
bills
was
distasteful
to
him
he
did
not
tell
his
wife
of
the
occurrence
nor
did
he
put
the
money
in
the
black
bag
where
their
money
was
always
kept
in
the
bureau
drawer
safe
under
lock
and
key
he
could
not
do
that
without
telling
his
wife
where
it
came
from
so
he
shoved
it
carelessly
into
the
pocket
of
the
light
overcoat
that
he
was
wearing
sam
motherwell
was
not
a
careless
man
about
money
but
the
possession
of
this
particular
dollars
gave
him
no
pleasure
chapter
viii
the
other
doctor
the
young
minister
went
down
the
street
with
a
thoughtful
face
i
wonder
if
i
did
right
he
was
thinking
it
is
a
hard
thing
to
talk
that
way
to
a
human
being
and
yet
it
seems
to
be
the
only
thing
to
do
oh
what
it
would
mean
for
god
work
if
all
these
rich
farmers
were
saved
from
their
insatiable
greed
he
turned
into
clay
office
oh
clay
he
burst
out
when
he
had
answered
the
young
man
friendly
greeting
it
is
an
awful
thing
to
lay
open
a
mean
man
meanness
and
tell
him
the
plain
truth
about
himself
it
is
indeed
the
young
doctor
answered
but
perhaps
it
is
heroic
treatment
your
man
needed
for
i
would
infer
that
you
have
been
reading
the
law
to
someone
who
was
it
sam
motherwell
the
minister
answered
well
you
had
a
good
subject
the
doctor
said
gravely
for
aggravated
greed
and
fatty
degeneration
of
the
conscience
motherwell
is
certainly
a
wonder
when
that
poor
english
girl
took
the
fever
out
here
it
was
hard
to
convince
sam
that
she
was
really
sick
at
them
red
cheeks
of
hers
he
said
to
me
her
ears
cold
and
her
eyes
is
bright
as
ever
she
just
lookin
for
a
rest
i
think
if
you
wuz
to
ask
me
how
did
you
convince
him
i
told
him
the
girl
would
have
to
have
a
trained
nurse
and
would
be
sick
probably
six
weeks
and
then
they
could
get
the
poor
girl
off
their
hands
quick
enough
do
want
that
girl
dyin
round
here
sam
said
is
motherwell
as
close
as
he
is
the
minister
asked
after
a
pause
some
say
worse
the
doctor
replied
but
i
do
believe
it
she
ca
be
the
minister
face
was
troubled
i
wish
i
knew
what
to
do
for
them
he
said
sadly
i
tell
you
something
you
can
do
for
me
the
doctor
said
sitting
up
straight
or
at
least
something
you
may
try
to
do
what
is
it
the
minister
asked
devise
some
method
suggest
some
course
of
treatment
whereby
my
tried
and
trusty
horse
pleurisy
will
cease
to
look
so
much
like
a
i
afraid
the
humane
society
will
get
after
me
the
minister
laughed
everybody
knew
clay
horse
there
was
no
danger
of
mistaking
him
for
any
other
he
was
tall
and
lean
and
gaunt
the
doctor
had
bought
him
believing
him
to
be
in
poor
condition
which
good
food
and
good
care
would
remedy
but
as
the
months
went
by
in
spite
of
all
the
doctor
could
do
pleurisy
remained
the
same
eating
everything
the
doctor
brought
him
and
looking
for
more
but
showing
no
improvement
i
tried
everything
except
the
doctor
went
on
and
pink
pills
and
i
would
like
to
turn
over
the
responsibility
to
someone
else
i
think
perhaps
his
trouble
must
be
mental
some
gnawing
sorrow
that
keeps
him
awake
at
night
i
do
mind
driving
pleurisy
where
people
know
me
and
know
that
i
do
feed
him
occasionally
but
it
is
disconcerting
when
i
meet
strangers
to
have
old
ladies
shake
their
heads
at
me
i
know
what
they
thinking
and
i
believe
pleurisy
really
enjoys
it
and
then
when
i
drive
past
a
farmhouse
to
see
the
whole
family
run
out
and
hold
their
sides
is
not
a
pleasure
talk
about
scattering
sunshine
pleurisy
leaves
a
trail
of
merriment
wherever
he
goes
what
difference
does
it
make
what
people
think
when
your
conscience
is
clear
you
do
feed
your
horse
you
feed
him
well
so
what
the
odds
inquired
the
rev
hugh
grantley
son
of
granite
child
of
the
heather
looking
with
lifted
brows
at
his
friend
oh
there
you
go
the
doctor
said
smiling
that
the
shorter
catechism
coming
out
in
you
that
scotch
complacency
is
the
thing
i
wish
i
had
but
i
ca
help
feeling
like
a
rogue
a
cheat
an
oppressor
of
the
helpless
when
i
look
at
pleurisy
horace
the
minister
said
kindly
with
his
level
gray
eyes
fixed
thoughtfully
on
his
friend
handsome
face
a
man
in
either
your
calling
or
mine
has
no
right
to
ask
himself
how
he
feels
do
feel
your
own
pulse
too
much
it
is
disquieting
it
is
for
us
to
go
on
never
faltering
and
never
looking
behind
in
other
words
to
make
good
and
never
mind
the
fans
the
doctor
smiled
then
he
became
serious
but
grantley
i
am
not
always
so
sure
i
am
right
as
you
are
you
see
a
sinner
is
always
a
sinner
and
in
danger
of
damnation
for
which
there
is
but
one
cure
but
a
sick
man
may
have
quinsy
or
he
may
have
diphtheria
and
the
treatment
is
different
but
oh
grantley
i
wish
i
had
that
confidence
in
myself
that
you
have
if
you
were
a
doctor
you
would
tell
a
man
he
had
typhoid
and
he
proceed
to
have
it
even
if
he
had
only
set
out
to
have
an
ingrowing
but
my
patients
have
a
decided
will
of
their
own
there
young
ab
cowan
they
sent
for
me
last
night
to
go
out
to
see
him
he
has
a
bad
attack
of
quinsy
but
it
is
the
strangest
case
i
ever
saw
the
gaiety
had
died
out
of
the
young
man
face
and
he
looked
perplexed
and
anxious
i
do
wish
the
old
doctor
and
i
were
on
speaking
terms
he
concluded
and
are
you
not
the
minister
asked
in
surprise
miss
barner
told
me
that
you
had
been
very
kind
and
i
thought
there
was
a
flush
on
the
minister
face
and
he
hesitated
oh
miss
barner
and
i
are
the
best
of
friends
the
doctor
said
i
say
grantley
has
that
little
girl
had
one
lonely
life
and
she
the
brave
little
soul
the
minister
was
silent
all
but
his
eyes
the
doctor
went
on
hath
sorrow
who
hath
woe
who
hath
redness
of
eyes
solomon
was
it
who
said
it
was
who
tarry
long
at
the
wine
i
think
he
should
have
added
who
wait
at
home
do
you
think
she
is
a
remarkably
beautiful
girl
grantley
he
asked
abruptly
i
do
indeed
the
minister
answered
giving
his
friend
a
searching
glance
but
how
about
the
doctor
why
will
he
not
speak
to
you
he
was
glad
of
a
chance
to
change
the
subject
i
suppose
the
old
man
pride
is
hurt
every
time
he
sees
me
he
evidently
thinks
he
is
all
the
medical
aid
they
need
around
here
but
i
do
wish
he
would
come
with
me
to
see
this
young
cowan
it
the
most
puzzling
case
i
ever
met
there
are
times
grantley
when
i
think
i
should
be
following
the
plough
the
minister
looked
at
him
thoughtfully
a
man
can
only
do
his
best
horace
he
said
kindly
chapter
ix
the
live
wire
who
is
this
young
gentleman
or
lady

asked
of
pearlie
watson
one
day
when
he
met
her
wheeling
a
baby
carriage
with
an
abnormally
fat
baby
in
it
this
is
the
czar
of
all
the
rooshia
pearl
answered
gravely
and
his
the
doctor
face
showed
no
surprise
as
he
stepped
back
to
get
a
better
look
at
the
czar
who
began
to
squirm
at
the
delay
see
the
green
plush
on
his
kerridge
pearl
said
proudly
and
every
stitch
he
has
on
is
and
was
did
for
him
too
and
he
fed
every
three
hours
rain
or
shine

or
miss

of
that
the
doctor
exclaimed
with
emphasis
and
yet
some
people
tell
us
that
the
czar
has
a
hard
time
of
it
pearl
drew
a
step
nearer
moving
the
carriage
up
and
down
rapidly
to
appease
the
wrath
of
the
czar
who
was
expressing
his
disapproval
in
a
very
lumpy
cry
i
just
you
know
about
him
bein
the
czar
she
said
confidentially
you
see
i
mind
him
every
day
and
that

play
maudie

said
one
day
i
never
had
no

and
that
started
me
it
a
lovely
game
the
doctor
nodded
he
knew
something
of
games
too
i
have
to
taste
everything
he
eats
for
fear
of
paris
green
pearl
went
on
speaking
now
in
the
loud
official
tone
of
the
i
have
to
stand
between
him
and
the
howlin
mob
thirstin
for
his
gore
he
seems
to
howl
more
than
the
mob
the
doctor
said
smiling
he
afraid
we
plottin
pearl
whispered
ca
trust
no
one
he
ai
howlin
that
his
natcheral
voice
when
he
talkin

he
do

english

every
time

now
how
is
a
precious
see
the
pitty
man
pull
um
baby
toofin
at
which
the
czar
secure
in
his
toothlessness
rippled
his
fat
face
into
dimples
and
triumphantly
brought
forth
a
whole
succession
of
goos
ai
he
a
peach
pearlie
said
with
pride
some
kids
wo
show
off
worth
a
cent
when
ye
want
them
to
but
he
say
if
you
even
nudge
him
his
mother
thinks
is
awful
childish
and
she
is
at
him
all
the
time
to
say
but
he
never
lets
on
he
hears
her
say
doctor
pearlie
face
was
troubled
what
do
you
think
of
his
looks
just
between
ourselves
has
he
a
fine
little
nub
of
a
nose
do
you
see
anything
about
him
to
make
his
mother
cry
the
doctor
looked
critically
at
the
czar
who
returned
his
gaze
with
stolid
indifference
i
never
saw
a
more
perfect
nub
on
any
nose
he
answered
honestly
he
a
fine
big
boy
and
his
mother
should
be
proud
of
him
there
now
what
did
i
tell
you
pearlie
cried
delightedly
nodding
her
head
at
an
imaginary
audience
that
what
i
always
say
to
his
mother
but
she
so
tuk
up
with
pictures
of
pretty
kids
with
big
eyes
and
curly
hair
she
do
seem
to
be
able
to
get
used
to
him
she
never
says
his
nose
is
a
pug
but
she
says
it
and
his
voice
is
not
what
she
wanted
he
cries
lumpy
i
know
but
his
goos
are
all
right
the
kid
in
the
book
she
is
readin
could
say
before
he
was
as
old
as
the
czar
is
and
it
awful
hard
on
her
you
see
he
ca
or
or
wave
a
or
nothin
i
never
told
her
what
danny
could
do
when
he
was
this
age
but
i
am
hard
to
get
him
to
say
she
has
her
heart
set
on
that
well
i
must
go
on
now
the
doctor
lifted
his
hat
and
the
imperial
carriage
moved
on
she
had
gone
a
short
distance
when
she
remembered
something
i
let
you
know
when
he
says
it
doc
she
shouted
all
right
do
forget
he
smiled
back
when
pearlie
turned
the
next
corner
she
met
maudie
ducker
maudie
ducker
had
on
a
new
plaid
dress
with
velvet
trimming
and
maudie
knew
it
is
that
your
sunday
dress
she
asked
pearl
looking
critically
at
pearlie
faded
little
brown
winsey
my
no
pearlie
answered
cheerfully
this
is
just
my
morning
dress
i
wear
my
blue
satting
in
the
afternoon
and
on
sundays
my
purple
velvet
with
the

with

yours
is
a
nice
little
plain
dress
that
stuff

lined
a
quilt
for

with
it
and
it
faded
gray
maudie
ducker
was
a
perfect
little
lady
her
mother
often
said
so
maudie
could
not
bear
to
sit
near
a
child
in
school
who
had
on
a
dirty
pinafore
or
ragged
clothes
and
the
number
of
days
that
she
could
wear
a
pinafore
without
its
showing
one
trace
of
stain
was
simply
wonderful
maudie
had
two
dolls
which
she
never
played
with
they
were
propped
up
against
the
legs
of
the
parlour
table
maudie
could
play
the
java
march
and
mary
pet
waltz
on
the
piano
she
always
spoke
in
a
hushed
vox
tremulo
and
never
played
any
rough
games
she
could
not
bear
to
touch
a
baby
because
it
might
put
a
sticky
little
finger
on
her
pinafore
all
of
which
goes
to
show
what
a
perfect
little
lady
she
was
when
maudie
made
inquiries
of
pearl
watson
as
to
her
attire
her
motives
were
more
kindly
than

was
giving
her
a
party

had
been
selected
with
great
care
and
with
respect
to
social
standing
and
blue
china
and
correct
enunciation
this
time
they
were
selected
with
greater
care
but
with
respect
to
their
fathers
politics
all
conservatives
and
undecided
voters
children
were
included
the
reformers
were
tabooed
algernon
evans
otherwise
known
as
the
czar
of
all
the
rooshias
only
son
of
evans
editor
of
the
millford
mercury
could
not
be
overlooked
hence
the
reason
for
asking
pearl
watson
his
millford
had
two
weekly
newspapers
one
conservative
in
its
tendencies
and
the
other
one
reform
between
them
there
existed
a
feud
long
standing
unquenchable
constant
it
went
with
the
printing
press
the
subscription
list
and
the
of
the
former
owner
when
the
paper
changed
hands
the
feud
was
discernible
in
the
local
news
as
well
as
in
the
editorials
in
the
reform
paper
which
was
edited
at
the
time
of
which
we
write
by
a
tipperary
man
named
mcsorley
you
might
read
of
a
distressing
accident
which
befell
one
simon
henry
also
a
reformer
while
that
great
and
good
man
was
abroad
upon
an
errand
of
mercy
trying
to
induce
a
drunken
man
to
go
quietly
to
his
home
and
family
henry
was
eulogised
for
his
kind
act
and
regret
was
expressed
that
henry
should
have
met
with
such
rough
usage
while
endeavouring
to
hold
out
a
helping
hand
to
one
unfortunate
enough
to
be
held
in
the
demon
chains
of
intemperance
in
the
conservative
paper
the
following
appeared
we
regret
to
hear
that
simon
henry
secretary
of
the
young
liberal
club
got
mixed
up
in
a
drunken
brawl
last
evening
and
as
a
result
will
be
confined
to
his
house
for
a
few
days
we
trust
his
injuries
are
not
serious
as
his
services
are
indispensable
to
his
party
in
the
coming
campaign
reports
of
concerts
weddings
even
deaths
were
tinged
with
partyism
when
daniel
grover
grand
old
conservative
was
gathered
to
his
fathers
at
the
ripe
age
of
years
the
reform
paper
said
that
grover
death
was
not
entirely
unexpected
as
his
health
had
been
failing
for
some
time
the
deceased
having
passed
his
seventieth
birthday
mcsorley
the
liberal
editor
being
an
irishman
was
not
without
humour
but
evans
the
other
one
revelled
in
it
he
was
like
the
little
boys
who
stick
pins
in
frogs
not
that
they
bear
the
frogs
any
but
for
the
fun
of
seeing
them
jump
he
would
sit
half
the
night
over
his
political
editorials
smiling
grimly
to
himself
and
when
he
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
and
laughed
like
a
boy
the
knife
was
turned
in
someone
one
day
james
ducker
lately
retired
farmer
sometimes
insurance
agent
read
in
the
winnipeg
telegram
that
his
friend
the
honourable
thomas
snider
had
chaperoned
an
elk
party
to
paul
ducker
had
but
a
hazy
idea
of
the
duties
of
a
chaperon
but
he
liked
the
sound
of
it
and
it
set
him
thinking
he
remembered
when
tom
snider
had
entered
politics
with
a
decayed
reputation
a
large
whiskey
bill
and
about
in
cash
now
he
rode
in
a
private
car
and
had
a
suite
of
rooms
at
the
empire
and
the
papers
often
spoke
of
him
as
mine
host
snider
ducker
turned
over
the
paper
and
read
that
the
genial
thomas
had
replied
in
a
very
happy
manner
to
a
toast
at
the
elks
banquet
whereupon
ducker
became
wrapped
in
deep
thought
and
during
this
passive
period
he
distinctly
heard
his
country
call
the
call
came
in
these
words
if
tom
snider
can
do
it
why
not
me
the
idea
took
hold
of
him
he
began
to
brush
his
hair
artfully
over
the
bald
spot
he
made
strange
faces
at
his
mirror
wondering
which
side
of
his
face
would
be
the
best
to
have
photographed
for
his
handbills
he
saw
himself
like
cincinnatus
of
old
called
from
the
plough
to
the
senate
but
he
told
himself
there
could
not
have
been
as
good
a
thing
in
it
then
as
there
is
now
or
cincinnatus
would
not
have
come
back
to
the
steers
ducker
social
qualities
developed
amazingly
he
courted
his
neighbours
assiduously
sending
presents
from
his
garden
stopping
to
have
protracted
conversations
with
men
whom
he
had
known
but
slightly
before
every
man
whose
name
was
on
the
voters
list
began
to
have
a
new
significance
for
him
there
was
one
man
whom
he
feared
that
was
evans
editor
of
the
conservative
paper
sometimes
when
his
fancy
painted
for
him
a
gay
and
alluring
picture
of
carrying
the
proud
old
conservative
banner
that
has
suffered
defeat
but
thank
god
never
disgrace
in
the
face
of
the
foe
quotation
from
speech
ducker
had
prepared
sometimes
he
would
in
the
midst
of
the
most
glowing
and
glorious
passages
inadvertently
think
of
evans
and
it
gave
him
ducker
had
lived
in
and
around
millford
for
some
time
so
had
evans
and
evans
had
a
most
treacherous
memory
you
could
not
depend
on
him
to
forget
anything
when
evans
was
friendly
with
him
ducker
hopes
ran
high
but
when
he
caught
evans
looking
at
him
with
that
boyish
smile
of
his
twinkling
in
his
eyes
the
vision
of
chaperoning
an
elk
party
to
paul
became
very
shadowy
indeed
ducker
tried
diplomacy
he
withdrew
his
insurance
advertisement
from
mcsorley
paper
and
doubled
his
space
in
evans
paying
in
advance
he
watched
the
trains
for
visitors
and
reported
them
to
evans
he
wrote
breezy
little
local
briefs
in
his
own
light
way
for
evans
paper
but
ducker
journalistic
fervour
received
a
serious
set
back
one
day
he
rushed
into
the
mercury
office
just
as
the
paper
went
to
press
with
the
news
that
old
williamson
had
at
last
winged
her
somewhat
delayed
flight
evans
thanked
him
with
some
cordiality
for
letting
him
know
in
time
to
make
a
note
of
it
and
asked
him
to
go
around
to
williamson
home
and
find
out
a
few
facts
for
the
obituary
ducker
did
so
with
great
cheerfulness
rather
out
of
keeping
with
the
nature
of
his
visit
he
felt
that
his
way
was
growing
brighter
when
he
reached
the
old
lady
home
he
was
received
with
all
courtesy
by
her
son
ducker
bristled
with
importance
as
he
made
known
his
errand
in
a
neat
speech
in
which
official
dignity
and
sympathy
were
artistically
blended
the
young
may
die
but
the
old
must
die
he
reminded
williamson
as
he
produced
his
pencil
and
tablet
williamson
gave
a
detailed
account
of
his
mother
early
life
marriages
first
and
second
and
located
all
her
children
with
painstaking
accuracy
left
to
mourn
her
loss
ducker
wrote
and
the
cause
of
her
death
ducker
inquired
gently
general
breaking
down
of
the
system
i
suppose
with
his
pencil
poised
in
the
air
williamson
knit
his
shaggy
brows
well
i
would
say
too
much
about
mother
death
if
i
were
you
stick
to
her
birth
and
the
date
she
joined
the
church
and
her
marriages
they
sure
but
mother
death
is
a
little
uncertain
just
yet
a
toothless
chuckle
came
from
the
adjoining
room
williamson
had
been
an
interested
listener
to
the
conversation
order
my
coffin
ducker
on
your
way
down
but
never
mind
the
flowers
they
might
not
keep
she
shrilled
after
him
as
he
beat
a
hasty
retreat
when
ducker
crestfallen
and
humiliated
the
mercury
office
a
few
moments
later
he
was
watched
by
two
twinkling
irish
eyes
that
danced
with
unholy
merriment
at
that
good
man
discomfiture
they
belonged
to
ignatius
benedicto
mcsorley
the
editor
of
the
other
paper
but
ducker
was
hopeful
a
friend
of
hers
in
winnipeg
had
already
a
house
in
view
for
them
and
ducker
had
decided
the
church
they
would
attend
when
the
session
opened
and
what
day
she
would
have
and
many
other
important
things
that
it
is
well
to
have
one
mind
made
up
on
and
not
leave
to
the
last
maudie
ducker
had
been
taken
into
the
secret
and
began
to
feel
sorry
for
the
other
little
girls
whose
papas
were
contented
to
let
them
live
always
in
such
a
pokey
little
place
as
millford
maudie
also
began
to
dream
dreams
of
sweeping
in
upon
the
millford
people
in
flowing
robes
and
waving
plumes
and
sparkling
diamonds
in
a
gorgeous
red
automobile
wilford
ducker
only
of
the
ducker
family
was
not
taken
into
the
secret
he
was
too
young
his
mother
said
to
understand
the
change
the
nomination
day
was
drawing
near
which
had
something
to
do
with
the
date
of
maudie
ducker
party
ducker
told
maudie
they
must
invite
the
czar
and
pearl
watson
though
of
course
she
did
not
say
the
czar
she
said
algernon
evans
and
that
little
watson
girl
maudie
being
a
perfect
little
lady
objected
to
pearl
watson
on
account
of
her
scanty
wardrobe
and
to
the
czar
moist
little
hands
but
ducker
knowing
that
the
czar
father
was
their
long
suit
stood
firm
ducker
had
said
to
her
that
very
morning
rubbing
his
hands
and
speaking
in
the
conspirator
voice
we
must
leave
no
stone
unturned
this
is
the
time
of
my
dear
we
must
pull
every
wire
the
czar
was
a
wire
therefore
they
proceeded
to
pull
him
they
did
not
know
he
was
a
live
wire
until
later
pearl
watson
delight
at
being
asked
to
a
real
party
knew
no
bounds
maudie
need
not
have
worried
about
pearl
appearing
at
the
feast
without
the
festal
robe
the
dress
that
camilla
had
made
for
her
was
just
waiting
for
such
an
occasion
to
air
its
loveliness
anything
that
was
needed
to
complete
her
toilet
was
supplied
by
her
mistress
the
czar
mother
but
evans
stood
looking
wistfully
after
her
only
son
as
pearl
wheeled
him
gaily
down
the
walk
he
was
beautifully
dressed
in
the
finest
of
mull
and
valenciennes
his
carriage
was
the
loveliest
they
could
buy
pearl
in
her
neat
hat
and
dress
was
a
little
nurse
girl
to
be
proud
of
but
evans
pretty
face
was
troubled
she
was
thinking
of
the
pretty
baby
pictures
in
the
magazines
and
algernon
was
so
different
and
his
nose
was
strange
too
and
she
had
massaged
it
so
carefully
too
and
when
oh
when
would
he
say
but
algeron
was
not
envious
of
any
other
baby
beauty
that
afternoon
nor
worried
about
his
nose
either
as
he
bumped
up
and
down
in
his
carriage
in
glad
good
humour
and
delivered
gurgling
goos
at
every
person
he
met
even
throwing
them
along
the
street
in
the
prodigality
of
his
heart
as
he
waved
his
fat
hands
and
thumped
his
heavy
little
heels
pearl
held
her
head
high
and
was
very
much
the
as
she
lifted
the
weighty
ruler
to
the
ground
ducker
ran
down
the
steps
and
kissed
the
czar
ostentatiously
pouring
out
such
a
volume
of
admiring
and
endearing
epithets
that
pearl
stood
in
bewilderment
wondering
why
she
had
never
heard
of
this
before
ducker
carried
the
czar
into
the
house
pearl
following
with
one
eye
shut
which
was
her
way
of
expressing
perplexity
two
little
girls
in
very
fluffy
short
skirts
sat
demurely
in
the
hammock
keeping
their
dresses
clean
and
wondering
if
there
would
be
within
doors
maudie
worried
out
the
java
march
on
the
piano
to
a
dozen
or
more
patient
little
listeners
on
the
lawn
several
little
girls
played
croquet
there
were
no
boys
at
the
party
wilford
was
going
to
have
the
boys
that
is
the
conservative
boys
the
next
day
ducker
did
not
believe
in
boys
are
so
rough
except
wilford
he
had
been
so
carefully
brought
up
he
was
not
rough
at
all
he
stood
awkwardly
by
the
gate
watching
the
girls
play
croquet
he
had
been
left
without
a
station
at
his
own
request
patsey
watson
rode
by
on
a
dray
wagon
dirty
and
jolly
wilford
called
to
him
furtively
but
patsey
was
busy
holding
on
and
did
not
hear
him
wilford
sighed
heavily
down
at
the
tracks
a
freight
train
shunted
and
shuddered
not
a
boy
was
in
sight
he
knew
why
the
farmers
were
loading
cattle
cars
pearl
went
around
to
the
side
lawn
where
the
girls
were
playing
croquet
holding
the
czar
hand
tightly
what
are
you
playin
she
asked
they
told
her
can
you
play
it
mildred
bates
asked
i
guess
i
can
pearl
said
modestly
but
i
always
too
busy
for
games
like
that
maudie
ducker
says
you
never
play
mildred
bates
said
with
pity
in
her
voice
maudie
ducker
is
away
off
there
pearl
answered
with
dignity
i
have
more
fun
in
one
day
than
maudie
ducker
ever
have
if
she
lives
to
be
as
old
as
melchesidick
and
it
not
this
frowsy
that
you
kids
call
fun
either
tell
us
about
it
pearl
they
shouted
eagerly
pearl
stories
had
a
charm
well
pearl
began
ye
know
i
wash
evans
dishes
every
day
and
lovely
ones
they
are
too
all
pink
and
gold
with
dinky
little
ivy
leaves
crawlin
out
over
the
edges
of
the
cups
i
play
i
am
at
the
seashore
and
the
tide
is
comin
in
and
the
sand
and
and
the
land
far
as
eye
can
see
that
out
of
a
book
i
put
all
the
dishes
into
the
big
dish
pan
and
i
pertend
the
tide
is
on
them
though
it
just
me
pourin
on
the
water
the
cups
are
the
boys
and
the
saucers
are
the
girls
the
plates
are
the
fathers
and
mothers
and
the
butter
chips
are
the
babies
then
i
rush
in
to
save
them
but
not
until
they
cry
save
us
we
perish
of
course
i
yell
it
for
them
good
and
loud
too
people
do
just
squawk
at
a
time
like
that
it
often
scares
evans
even
yet
i
save
the
babies
first
i
slush
them
around
to
clean
them
but
they
never
notice
that
and
i
stand
them
up
high
and
dry
in
the
then
i
go
in
after
the
girls
and
they
quiet
down
the
babies
in
the
and
then
the
mothers
i
bring
out
and
the
boys
and
the
fathers
sometimes
some
of
the
men
make
a
dash
out
before
the
women
but
you
bet
i
lay
them
back
in
a
hurry
then
i
set
the
ocean
back
on
the
stove
and
i
rub
the
babies
to
get
their
blood
circlin
again
and
i
get
them
all
put
to
bed
on
the
second
shelf
and
they
soon
forget
they
were
so
near
door
mary
ducker
had
finished
the
java
march
and
mary
pet
waltz
and
had
joined
the
interested
group
on
the
lawn
and
now
stood
listening
in
dull
wonder
i
rub
them
all
and
shine
them
well
pearl
went
on
and
get
them
all
packed
off
home
into
the
china
cupboard
every
man
jack
o
them
we
yet
alive
and
see
each
other
face
evans
sings
it
for
them
when
she
there
then
i
get
the
vegetable
dishes
and
bowls
and
silverware
and
all

and
that
an
excursion
and
they

not
a
sober
man
on
board
they
sing
up
old
boys
wo
go
home
till
and
all
that
and
crash
a
cry
bursts
from
every
soul
on
board
they
have
struck
upon
a
rock
and
are
going
down
water
pours
in
at
the
gunnel
that
just
me
with
more
water
and
soap

but
i
sorry
for
them
for
they
all
old
enough
to
know
that
is
a
mocker
strong
drink
is
ragin
and
whosoever
is
deceived
thereby
is
not
wise
but
when
the
crash
comes
and
the
swellin
waters
burst
in
they
get
sober
pret
quick
and
come
rushin
up
on
deck
with
pale
faces
to
see
what
wrong
and
i
often
seen
a
big
bowl
whirl
and
kind
o
dizzy
and
say
is
me
and
sink
to
the
bottom
evans

me
that

doin
for
them
i
rub
them
all
up
and
send
them
home

steel
knives
they
the
worst
of
all
but
though
they
black
and
stained
with
sin
they
still
our
brothers
and
so
we
give
them
the
gold
cure
that
the
and
they
make
a
fresh
start
when
i
sweep
the
floor
i
pertend
i
the
army
of
the
lord
that
comes
to
clear
the
way
from
dust
and
sin
let
the
king
of
glory
in
under
the
stove
the
hordes
of
sin
are
awful
thick
they
love
darkness
rather
than
light
because
their
deeds
are
evil
but
i
say
the
of
the
lord
and
of
gideon
and
let
them
have
it
sometimes
i
pertend
i
the
woman
that
lost
the
piece
of
silver
and
i
sweep
the
house
diligently
till
i
find
it
and
once
evans
did
put
ten
cents
in
a
corner
just
for
fun
for
me
and
i
never
know
when
she
goin
to
do
something
like
that
here
maudie
ducker
who
had
been
listening
with
growing
wonder
interrupted
pearl
with
the
cry
of
oh
here
pa
and
evans
going
to
take
our
pictures
the
little
girls
were
immediately
roused
out
of
the
spell
that
pearlie
story
had
put
upon
them
and
began
to
group
themselves
under
the
trees
arranging
their
little
skirts
and
frills
the
czar
had
toddled
on
his
uncertain
little
fat
legs
around
to
the
back
door
for
he
had
caught
sight
of
a
red
head
which
he
knew
and
liked
very
much
it
belonged
to
mary
mcsorley
the
eldest
of
the
mcsorley
family
who
had
brought
over
to
ducker
the
extra
two
quarts
of
milk
which
ducker
had
ordered
for
the
occasion
mary
sat
on
the
back
step
until
ducker
should
find
time
to
empty
her
pitcher
mary
was
strictly
an
outsider
mary
father
was
a
reformer
he
ran
the
opposition
paper
to
dear
evans
mary
was
never
well
dressed
partly
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
the
angels
had
visited
the
mcsorley
home
so
often
therefore
for
these
reasons
mary
sat
on
the
back
step
a
rank
outsider
the
czar
who
knew
nothing
of
these
things
began
to
goo
as
soon
as
he
saw
her
mary
reached
out
her
arms
the
czar
stumbled
into
them
and
mary
fell
to
kissing
his
bald
head
she
felt
more
at
home
with
a
baby
in
her
arms
it
was
at
this
unfortunate
moment
that
ducker
and
evans
came
around
to
the
rear
of
the
house
evans
was
beginning
to
think
rather
more
favourably
of
ducker
as
the
prospective
conservative
member
he
might
do
all
right
there
are
plenty
worse
he
has
no
brains
but
that
does
not
matter
what
need
has
a
man
of
brains
when
he
goes
into
politics
brainy
men
make
the
trouble
the
grits
made
that
mistake
once
elected
a
brainy
man
and
they
have
had
no
peace
since
ducker
had
adroitly
drawn
the
conversation
to
a
general
discussion
of
children
he
knew
that
evans
weak
point
was
his
little
son
algernon
that
a
clever
looking
little
chap
of
yours
evans
he
had
remarked
carelessly
as
they
came
up
the
street
ducker
had
never
seen
the
czar
closely
my
wife
was
just
saying
the
other
day
that
he
has
a
wonderful
forehead
for
a
little
fellow
he
has
the
other
man
said
smiling
not
at
all
displeased
it
runs
clear
down
to
his
neck
he
can
hardly
help
being
clever
if
there
anything
in
heredity
ducker
went
on
with
infinite
tact
feeling
his
rainbow
dreams
of
responding
to
toasts
at
elk
banquets
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
then
the
evil
genius
of
the
house
of
ducker
awoke
from
his
slumber
sat
up
and
took
notice
the
house
that
the
friend
in
winnipeg
had
selected
for
them
fell
into
irreparable
ruins
poor
maudie
automobile
vanished
at
a
touch
the
rosy
dreams
of
cincinnatus
and
of
carrying
the
grand
old
conservative
banner
in
the
face
of
the
foe
turned
to
clay
and
ashes
they
turned
the
corner
and
came
upon
mary
mcsorley
who
sat
on
the
back
step
with
the
czar
in
her
arms
mary
head
was
hidden
as
she
kissed
the
czar
fat
neck
and
in
the
general
babel
of
voices
within
and
without
she
did
not
hear
them
coming
speaking
about
heredity
ducker
said
suavely
speaking
in
a
low
voice
and
looking
at
whom
he
supposed
to
be
the
latest
mcsorley
it
looks
as
if
there
must
be
something
in
it
over
there
is
that
mcsorley
over
again
low
forehead
pug
nose
bulldog
tendencies
ducker
was
something
of
a
phrenologist
and
went
blithely
on
to
his
own
destruction
now
the
girl
is
rather
pleasant
looking
and
some
of
the
others
are
not
bad
at
all
but
this
one
is
surely
a
regular
little
mickey
i
believe
a
person
would
be
safe
in
saying
that
he
would
not
grow
up
a
mr
evans
was
the
worshipful
grand
master
of
the
loyal
orange
lodge
and
well
up
in
the
black
and
this
remark
ducker
thought
he
would
appreciate
mcsorley
will
never
be
dead
while
this
little
fellow
lives
ducker
laughed
merrily
rubbing
his
hands
the
czar
looked
up
and
saw
his
father
perhaps
he
understood
what
had
been
said
and
saw
the
hurt
in
his
father
face
and
longed
to
heal
him
of
it
perhaps
the
time
had
come
when
he
should
forever
break
the
bonds
that
had
lain
upon
his
speech
he
wriggled
off
knee
and
toddling
uncertainly
across
the
grass
with
a
mighty
mental
conflict
in
his
pudgy
little
face
held
out
his
dimpled
arms
with
a
glad
cry
of
that
evening
while
ducker
and
maudie
were
busy
fanning
ducker
and
putting
wet
towels
on
his
head
evans
sat
down
to
write
some
more
of
that
tiresome
election
stuff
john
his
pretty
little
wife
said
in
disappointment
as
she
proudly
rocked
the
emancipated
czar
to
sleep
yes
dear
it
is
election
stuff
but
it
is
not
a
bit
tiresome
he
answered
smiling
as
he
kissed
her
tenderly
several
times
during
the
evening
and
into
the
night
she
heard
him
laugh
his
happy
boyish
laugh
james
ducker
did
not
get
the
nomination
chapter
x
the
patsey
watson
waited
on
the
corner
of
the
street
it
was
in
the
early
morning
and
patsey
face
bore
marks
of
a
recent
and
mighty
conflict
with
soap
and
water
patsey
looked
apprehensively
every
now
and
then
at
his
home
his
mother
might
emerge
any
minute
and
insist
on
his
wearing
a
coat
his
mother
could
be
very
tiresome
that
way
sometimes
it
seemed
long
this
morning
to
wait
for
the
butcher
but
the
only
way
to
be
sure
of
a
ride
was
to
be
on
the
spot
sometimes
there
were
delays
in
getting
away
from
home
getting
on
a
coat
was
one
finding
a
hat
was
the
worst
of
all
since
bugsey
got
the
nail
in
his
foot
and
could
not
go
out
the
hat
question
was
easier
the
hat
was
still
hard
to
find
but
not
impossible
wilford
ducker
came
along
wilford
had
just
had
a
dose
of
electric
oil
artfully
concealed
in
a
cup
of
tea
and
he
felt
desperate
his
mother
had
often
told
him
not
to
play
with
any
of
the
watson
boys
they
were
so
rough
and
unladylike
in
their
manner
perhaps
that
was
why
wilford
came
over
at
once
to
patsey
patsey
did
not
care
for
wilford
ducker
even
if
he
did
live
in
a
big
house
with
screen
doors
on
it
mind
you
he
did
not
wear
braces
yet
only
a
waist
with
white
buttons
on
it
and
him
seven
patsey
manner
was
cold
you
goin
fer
wilford
asked
yep
patsey
answered
with
very
little
warmth
say
pat
lem
me
go
wilford
coaxed
nope
patsey
replied
indifferently
aw
do
pat
wo
cher
ducker
had
been
very
particular
about
wilford
enunciation
once
she
dismissed
a
servant
for
dropping
her
final
g
ducker
considered
it
more
serious
to
drop
a
final
g
than
a
dinner
plate
she
often
spoke
of
how
particular
she
was
she
said
she
had
insisted
on
correct
enunciation
from
the
first
so
wilford
said
again
aw
do
pat
wo
cher
patsey
looked
carelessly
down
the
street
and
began
to
sing
how
much
wood
would
a
chuck
if
a
could
chuck
wood
what
cher
take
fer
pat
wilford
asked
what
cher
got
patsey
had
stopped
singing
but
still
beat
time
with
his
foot
to
the
imaginary
music
wilford
produced
a
in
very
good
repair
patsey
stopped
beating
time
though
only
for
an
instant
it
does
not
do
to
be
too
keen
it
a
good
un
wilford
said
with
pride
it
a
rodger
mind
ye
two
blades
name
yer
price
patsey
condescended
after
a
deliberate
examination
lem
me
ride
all
week
and
not
much
i
wo
patsey
declared
stoutly
you
can
ride
three
days
for
it
wilford
began
to
whimper
but
just
then
the
butcher
cart
whirled
around
the
corner
wilford
ran
toward
it
patsey
held
the
knife
the
butcher
stopped
and
let
wilford
mount
it
was
all
one
to
the
butcher
he
knew
he
usually
got
a
boy
at
this
corner
patsey
ran
after
the
butcher
cart
he
had
caught
sight
of
someone
whom
wilford
had
not
yet
noticed
it
was
ducker
ducker
had
been
down
the
street
ordering
a
crate
of
pears
ducker
was
just
as
particular
about
pears
as
she
was
about
final
g
so
she
had
gone
herself
to
select
them
when
she
saw
wilford
her
son
riding
with
the
butcher
well
really
she
could
not
have
told
the
sensation
it
gave
her
wilford
could
not
have
told
either
just
how
he
felt
when
he
saw
his
mother
but
both
ducker
and
her
son
had
a
distinct
sensation
when
they
met
that
morning
she
called
wilford
and
he
came
no
sooner
had
he
left
his
seat
than
patsey
watson
took
his
place
wilford
dared
not
ask
for
the
return
of
the
knife
his
mother
would
know
that
he
had
had
dealings
with
patsey
watson
and
his
account
at
the
maternal
bank
was
already
overdrawn
ducker
was
more
sorrowful
than
angry
wilford
she
said
with
great
dignity
regarding
the
downcast
little
boy
with
exaggerated
scorn
and
you
a
ducker
she
escorted
the
fallen
ducker
sadly
homeward
but
oh
so
glad
that
she
had
saved
him
from
the
corroding
influence
of
the
butcher
boy
while
wilford
ducker
was
unfastening
the
china
buttons
on
his
waist
preparatory
to
a
season
of
rest
and
retirement
that
he
might
the
better
ponder
upon
the
sins
of
disobedience
and
evil
associations
patsey
watson
was
opening
and
shutting
his
new
knife
proudly
it
was
easy
done
he
was
saying
to
himself
i
kinder
sorry
i
jewed
him
down
now
might
as
well
ha
let
him
have
the
week

most
after

she
said
she
began
to
wonder
where
she
could
secure
help
then
she
had
an
inspiration
the
watsons
still
owed
ten
dollars
on
the
caboose
the
eldest
watson
girl
was
big
enough
to
work
they
would
get
her
and
get
ten
worth
of
work
out
of
her
if
they
could
the
next
saturday
night
john
watson
announced
to
his

motherwell
wanted

watson
cried

threw

not
be

in

he
buried
his
tousy
head
in

and
pearl
saw
at
once
that
her
whole
house
were
about
to
be
submerged
in
tears
idle

will
wipe
the

off

house
once
and
forever
waving
her
arm
dramatically
toward
the
caboose
which
formed
the
sleeping
apartment
for
the
boys

die
for
those

nobler
far
than

pearl
had
attended
the
queen
esther
cantata
the
winter
before
she
knew
now
how
poor
esther
felt
on
the
following
monday
afternoon
everything
was
ready
for
departure
her
small
supply
of
clothing
was
washed
and
ironed
and
neatly
packed
in
a
it
was
mary
who
thought
of
the
sittin
down
there
in
the
cellar
doin
nothin
and
with
a
handle
on
it
too
mary
was
getting
to
be
almost
as
smart
as
pearl
to
think
of
things
pearl
had
bidden
to
them
all
and
was
walking
to
the
door
when
her
mother
called
her
back
to
repeat
her
parting
instructions
now
mind
pearlie
dear
not
to
be
pickin
up
wid
strangers
and
speakin
to
people
ye
do
know
and
do
be
showin
yer
money
or
makin
change
wid
anyone
pearl
was
not
likely
to
disobey
the
last
injunction
she
had
seventeen
cents
in
money
ten
cents
of
which
teddy
had
given
her
and
the
remaining
seven
cents
had
come
in
under
the
heading
of
small
sums
from
the
other
members
of
the
family
she
was
a
pathetic
little
figure
in
her
brown
and
white
checked
dress
with
her
worldly
effects
in
the
as
she
left
the
shelter
of
her
father
roof
and
went
forth
into
the
untried
world
she
went
over
to
francis
to
say
to
her
and
to
camilla
francis
was
much
pleased
with
pearl
spirit
of
independence
and
spoke
beautifully
of
the
opportunities
for
service
which
would
open
for
her
you
must
keep
a
diary
pearl
she
said
enthusiastically
set
down
in
it
all
you
see
and
feel
you
will
have
such
splendid
opportunities
for
observing
plant
and
animal
life
the
smallest
little
insect
is
wonderfully
interesting
i
will
be
so
anxious
to
hear
how
you
are
impressed
with
the
great
green
world
of
out
of
doors
take
care
of
your
health
too
pearl
see
that
your
room
is
ventilated
while
francis
elaborated
on
the
elements
of
proper
living
camilla
in
the
kitchen
had
opened
the
little
bundle
in
the
cage
and
put
into
it
a
pair
of
stockings
and
two
or
three
handkerchiefs
then
she
slipped
in
a
little
purse
containing
ten
shining
pieces
and
an
orange
she
arranged
the
bundle
to
look
just
as
it
did
before
so
that
she
would
not
have
to
meet
pearl
gratitude
camilla
hastily
set
the
kettle
to
boil
and
began
to
lay
the
table
she
could
hear
the
velvety
tones
of
francis
voice
in
the
library
francis
speaks
a
strange
language
she
said
smiling
to
herself
but
it
can
be
translated
into
bread
and
butter
and
apple
sauce
and
even
into
shoes
and
stockings
when
you
know
how
to
interpret
it
but
would
it
be
dreadful
if
she
had
no
one
to
express
it
in
the
tangible
things
of
life
for
her
think
of
her
talking
about
proper
diet
and
aids
to
digestion
to
that
little
hungry
girl
well
it
seems
to
be
my
mission
to
step
into
the
gap
i
a
miss
with
a
mission
she
was
slicing
some
cold
ham
as
she
spoke
i
am
something
of
a
health
talker
too
camilla
knocked
at
the
library
door
and
in
answer
to
invitation
to
enter
opened
the
door
and
said
francis
would
it
not
be
well
for
pearl
to
have
a
lunch
before
she
starts
for
her
walk
into
the
country
the
air
is
so
exhilarating
you
know
how
thoughtful
you
are
camilla
francis
exclaimed
with
honest
admiration
thus
it
happened
that
pearlie
watson
aged
twelve
began
her
journey
into
the
big
unknown
world
fully
satisfied
in
body
and
soul
and
with
a
great
love
for
all
the
world
at
the
corner
of
the
street
stood
mcguire
and
at
sight
of
her
pearl
heart
stopped
beating
it
bad
luck
she
said
i
as
lief
have
a
rabbit
cross
me
path
as
her
but
she
walked
bravely
forward
with
no
outward
sign
of
her
inward
trembling
goin
to
sam
motherwell
are
ye
the
old
lady
asked
shrilly
yes
pearl
said
trembling
she
a
tarter
she
a
skinner
she
a
damner
that
what
she
is
she
my
own
first
cousin
and
i
know
her
sass
her
that
the
only
way
to
get
along
with
her
tell
her
i
said
so
here
child
rub
yer
with
this
when
ye
git
stiff
she
handed
pearl
a
black
bottle
of
liniment
pearl
thanked
her
and
hurried
on
but
at
the
next
turn
of
the
street
she
met
danny
danny
was
in
tears
danny
was
going
to
let
pearlie
go
away
danny
would
run
away
and
get
lost
and
runned
over
and
drownded
now
heart
melted
and
sitting
on
the
sidewalk
she
took
danny
in
her
arms
and
they
cried
together
a
whirr
of
wheels
aroused
pearl
and
looking
up
she
saw
the
kindly
face
of
the
young
doctor
what
is
it
pearl
he
asked
kindly
surely
that
not
danny
i
see
spoiling
his
face
that
way
it
danny
pearl
said
unsteadily
it
hard
enough
to
leave
him
widout
him
comin
afther
me
and
breakin
me
heart
all
over
again
that
what
it
is
pearl
the
doctor
said
smiling
i
think
it
is
mighty
thoughtless
of
danny
the
way
he
is
acting
danny
held
obstinately
to
pearl
skirt
and
cried
harder
than
ever
he
would
not
even
listen
when
the
doctor
spoke
of
taking
him
for
a
drive
listen
to
the
doctor
pearl
commanded
sternly
or
he
raise
a
gumboil
on
ye
thus
admonished
danny
ceased
his
sobs
but
he
showed
no
sign
of
interest
when
the
doctor
spoke
of
popcorn
and
at
the
mention
of
he
looked
simply
bored
he
awful
fond
of
candy
pearlie
suggested
in
a
whisper
holding
her
hand
around
her
mouth
so
that
danny
might
not
hear
her
ten
cents
worth
of
candy
to
the
boy
that
says
to
his
sister
like
a
gentleman
and
rides
home
with
me
danny
dried
his
eyes
on
pearl
skirt
kissed
her
gravely
and
climbed
into
the
buggy
beside
the
doctor
waterloo
was
won
pearl
did
not
trust
herself
to
look
back
as
she
walked
along
the
deeply
beaten
road
the
yellow
raised
their
heads
like
golden
stars
along
the
roadside
and
the
golden
glory
of
the
approaching
harvest
lay
upon
everything
to
the
right
the
tiger
hills
lay
on
the
horizon
wrapped
in
a
blue
mist
flocks
of
blackbirds
swarmed
over
the
ripening
oats
and
angrily
fought
with
each
other
and
it
not
costin
them
a
cent
pearl
said
in
disgust
as
she
stopped
to
watch
them
the
exhilaration
of
the
air
the
glory
of
the
waving
grain
the
profusion
of
wild
flowers
that
edged
the
fields
with
purple
and
yellow
were
like
wine
to
her
sympathetic
irish
heart
as
she
walked
through
the
grain
fields
and
drank
in
all
the
beauties
that
lay
around
and
it
was
not
until
she
came
in
sight
of
the
big
stone
house
gloomy
and
bare
that
she
realised
with
a
start
of
homesickness
that
she
was
pearl
watson
aged
twelve
away
from
home
for
the
first
time
and
bound
to
work
three
months
for
a
woman
of
reputed
but
i
do
it
pearl
said
swallowing
the
lump
that
gathered
in
her
throat
i
can
work
nobody
never
said
that
none
of
the
watsons
could
work
i
stay
out
me
time
if
it
kills
me
so
saying
pearl
knocked
timidly
at
the
back
door
myriads
of
flies
buzzed
on
the
screen
from
within
a
tired
voice
said
come
in
pearl
walked
in
and
saw
a
large
bare
room
with
a
long
table
in
the
middle
a
sewing
machine
littered
with
papers
stood
in
front
of
one
window
the
floor
had
been
painted
a
dull
drab
but
the
passing
of
many
feet
had
worn
the
paint
away
in
places
a
stove
stood
in
one
corner
over
the
sink
a
tall
woman
bent
trying
to
get
water
from
an
asthmatic
pump
oh
it
you
is
it
she
said
in
a
tone
so
very
unpleasant
that
pearl
thought
she
must
have
expected
someone
else
yes
pearl
said
meekly
who
were
ye
expectin
motherwell
stopped
pumping
for
a
minute
and
looked
at
pearl
why
did
ye
git
here
earlier
she
asked
well
pearl
began
i
was
late
gettin
started
by
reason
of
the
washin
and
the
ironin
and
jimmy
not
gettin
back
wid
the
boots
he
went
drivin
cattle
for
vale
the
butcher
and
he
had
to
have
the
boots
for
the
poison
ivy
is
that
bad
and
because
the
sugar
o
lead
is
all
done
and
anyway
ma
do
like
to
keep
it
in
the
house
for
wee
danny
might
eat
it
he
that
stirrin
and
me
not
there
to
watch
him
now
lord
what
a
tongue
you
have
put
down
your
things
and
go
out
and
pick
up
chips
to
light
the
fire
with
in
the
morning
pearl
laid
her
on
a
chair
and
was
back
so
soon
with
the
chips
that
motherwell
could
not
think
of
anything
to
say
now
go
for
the
cows
she
said
and
do
run
them
home
where
will
i
run
them
to
then
pearl
asked
innocently
good
land
child
have
i
to
tell
you
everything
folks
that
ca
do
without
tellin
ca
do
much
with
i
say
bring
the
cows
to
the
bars
and
do
stand
there
staring
at
me
when
pearl
dashed
out
of
the
door
she
almost
fell
over
the
old
dog
who
lay
sleepily
snapping
at
the
flies
which
buzzed
around
his
head
he
sprang
up
with
a
growl
which
died
away
into
an
apologetic
yawn
as
she
stooped
to
pat
his
honest
brown
head
a
group
of
red
calves
stood
at
the
bars
of
a
small
field
plaintively
calling
for
their
supper
it
was
not
just
an
ordinary
bawl
but
a
hyphenated
appeal
indicating
a
very
exhausted
condition
indeed
pearl
looked
at
them
in
pity
the
old
dog
wrinkling
his
nose
and
turning
away
his
head
did
not
give
them
a
glance
he
knew
them
noisy
things
let
bawl
come
on
across
the
narrow
creek
they
bounded
pearl
and
old
nap
and
up
the
other
hill
where
the
silver
willows
grew
so
tall
they
were
hidden
in
them
the
goldenrod
nodded
its
plumy
head
in
the
breeze
and
the
tall
gaillardia
brown
and
yellow
flickered
unsteadily
on
its
stem
the
billows
of
shadow
swept
over
the
wheat
on
each
side
of
the
narrow
pasture
the
golden
flowers
the
golden
fields
the
warm
golden
sunshine
intoxicated
pearl
with
their
luxurious
beauty
and
in
that
hour
of
delight
she
realised
more
pleasure
from
them
than
sam
motherwell
and
his
wife
had
in
all
their
long
lives
of
barren
selfishness
their
souls
were
of
a
dull
drab
dryness
in
which
no
flower
took
root
there
was
no
gold
to
them
but
the
gold
of
greed
and
gain
and
with
it
they
had
never
bought
a
smile
or
a
gentle
hand
pressure
or
a
fervid
god
bless
you
and
so
it
lost
its
golden
colour
and
turned
to
lead
and
ashes
in
their
hands
when
pearl
and
nap
got
the
cows
turned
homeward
they
had
to
slacken
their
pace
i
do
care
how
cross
she
is
pearl
said
if
i
can
come
for
the
cows
every
night
look
at
that
fluffy
white
cloud
say
would
that
make
a
hat
trimming
that
would
do
your
heart
good
the
body
of
the
hat
blue
like
that
up
there
edged
with
that
cloud
over
there
then
a
blue
cape
with
white
fur
on
it
just
to
match
i
kin
just
feel
that
white
stuff
under
my
chin
then
pearl
began
to
and
sing
a
song
she
had
heard
camilla
sing
she
had
forgotten
some
of
the
words
but
pearl
never
was
at
a
loss
for
words
the
wild
waves
are
singing
to
the
shore
as
they
were
in
the
happy
days
of
yore
pearl
could
not
remember
what
the
wild
waves
were
singing
so
she
sang
what
was
in
her
own
heart
she
ca
take
the
ripple
from
the
breeze
and
she
ca
take
the
rustle
from
the
trees
and
when
i
am
out
of
the
old
girl
sight
i
that
right
i
think
the
same
way
and
try
to
act
up
to
it
a
voice
said
slowly
but
do
let
her
hear
you
say
so
pearl
started
at
the
sound
of
the
voice
and
found
herself
looking
into
such
a
face
that
she
laughed
too
with
a
feeling
of
the
old
dog
ran
to
the
stranger
with
every
sign
of
delight
at
seeing
him
i
am
one
of
the
neighbours
he
said
i
live
over
there
pointing
to
a
little
shanty
farther
up
the
creek
did
i
frighten
you
i
am
sorry
if
i
did
but
you
see
i
like
the
sentiment
of
your
song
so
much
i
could
not
help
telling
you
you
need
not
think
it
strange
if
you
find
me
milking
one
of
the
cows
occasionally
you
see
i
believe
in
dealing
directly
with
the
manufacturer
and
thus
save
the
profit
and
so
i
just
take
what
milk
i
need
from
over
there
does
she
know
pearl
asked
nodding
toward
the
house
who
no
mrs
motherwell
well
no
he
answered
slowly
you
have
heard
of
her
having
a
fit
have
you
no
pearl
answered
wonderingly
then
we
safe
in
saying
that
the
secret
has
been
kept
from
her
does
it
hurt
her
though
pearl
asked
it
would
very
much
if
she
knew
it
the
young
man
replied
gravely
oh
i
mean
the
cow
pearl
said
hastily
it
does
hurt
the
cow
a
bit
what
does
she
care
who
gets
the
milk
when
did
you
come
pearl
said
i
must
hurry
she
have
a
rod
in
steep
for
me
if
i
late
my
name
pearl
watson
what
yours
jim
russell
he
said
i
know
your
brother
teddy
pearl
was
speeding
down
the
hill
she
shouted
back
i
know
who
you
are
now
pearl
ran
to
catch
up
to
the
cows
for
the
sun
was
throwing
long
shadows
over
the
pasture
and
the
plaintive
lowing
of
the
hungry
calves
came
faintly
to
her
ears
a
blond
young
man
stood
at
the
bars
with
four
milk
pails
he
raised
his
hat
when
he
spoke
to
pearl
madam
says
you
are
to
help
me
to
milk
but
i
assure
you
it
is
quite
unnecessary
really
i
would
much
prefer
that
you
should
why
pearl
asked
in
wonder
oh
by
jove
you
see
it
is
not
a
woman
place
to
work
outside
like
this
do
you
know
that
because
english
pearl
said
a
sudden
light
breaking
in
on
her
ma
says
when
ye
git
a
nice
englishman
there
nothing
nicer
and
pa
knowed
one
once
that
was
so
polite
he
used
to
say
buck
to
the
ox
and
then
he
say
i
beg
yer
pardon
i
mean
gee
it
you
was
it
no
he
said
smiling
i
have
never
driven
oxen
but
i
have
done
a
great
many
ridiculous
things
i
am
sure
so
have
i
pearl
said
confidentially
as
she
sat
down
on
a
little
stool
to
milk
you
know
them
fluffy
white
things
all
made
of
lace
and
truck
like
that
that
is
hung
over
the
beds
in
rich
people
houses
over
the
pillows
i
mean
he
asked
yes
that
them
well
when
i
stayed
with
camilla
one
night
at
francis
did
i
think
they
were
things
to
pull
down
to
keep
the
flies
off
face
say
you
should
have
heard
camilla
laugh
and
ma
saw
a
girl
at
a
picnic
once
who
drank
lemonade
through
her
veil
and
she
et
a
banana
skin
and
all
pearl
laughed
heartily
but
the
englishman
only
smiled
faintly
canadian
ways
were
growing
stranger
all
the
time
say
pearl
began
after
a
pause
who
does
the
cow
over
there
with
the
horns
bent
down
look
like
someone
we
both
know
only
the
cow
looks
pleasanter
my
word
the
englishman
exclaimed
you
a
rum
one
pearl
looked
disappointed
animals
often
look
like
people
she
said
we
have
two
cows
at
home
one
looks
like
white
so
good
and
gentle
would
say
boo
to
a
goose
the
other
one
looks
just
like
fred
miller
he
works
in
the
mill
and
his
hair
goes
in
a
roll
on
the
top
his
mother
did
it
that
way
with
a
too
long
i
guess
and
now
it
wo
go
any
other
way
and
i
know
an
animal
that
looks
like
you
he
a
dandy
too
you
bet
it
is
white
dog
and
he
can
jump
the
fence
easy
as
anything
oh
give
over
give
over
the
englishman
said
stiffly
pearl
laughed
delightedly
it
lots
of
fun
guessing
who
people

like
she
said
i
awful
smart
at
it
and
so
is
mary
four
years

once
we
could
not
guess

like
prayer
big
bug
eyes
lookin
away
into
nothin
but
it
all
for
the
best
do
you
pray

am
a
rector

he
answered

prayers

it
is
fair
to

it
when
jimmy
moore

my
brother
jimmy
ran
under

jimmie
moore

and
some
say
got
his
father
to
pray
too
he
the
methodist
minister
you
know
and
of
course
he
won
it
but
our
jimmy
could
ha
beat
him
easy
in
a
fair
race
and
no
favours
but
he
an
awful
snoopie
kid
and
prays
about
everything
do
you
sing
i
do
a
little
the
englishman
said
modestly
oh

rapturously
when
i
was
two
years
old
i
could
sing
my
babe

he
answered
i
only
been
in
the
kitchen
say
i
like
to
see
a
melodeon
just
the
very
name
of
it
makes
me
think
of
lovely
sounds
religious
sounds
mountin
higher
and
higher
and
swellin
out
grander
and
grander
rollin
right
into
the
great
white
throne
and
shakin
the
streets
of
gold
do
you
know
the
city
she
asked
after
a
pause
the
englishman
began
to
hum
it
in
a
rich
tenor
that
it
you
bet
she
cried
delightedly
just
think
of
you
coming
all
the
way
across
the
ocean
and
knowing
that
just
the
same
as
we
do
i
used
to
listen
at
the
keyhole
when
francis
had
company
and
i
was
there
helping
camilla
clay
sang
that
lots
of
times
the
englishman
had
not
sung
since
he
had
left
his
father
house
he
began
to
sing
now
in
a
sweet
full
voice
resonant
on
the
quiet
evening
air
the
cows
staring
idly
at
him
the
old
dog
came
down
to
the
bars
with
his
bristles
up
expecting
trouble
old
sam
and
his
son
tom
coming
in
from
work
stopped
to
listen
to
these
strange
sounds
confound
them
english
old
sam
said
ye
think
i
was
payin
him
to
do
that
and
it
too
when
clay
with
danny
watson
gravely
perched
beside
him
drove
along
the
river
road
after
saying
to
pearl
they
met
miss
barner
who
had
been
digging
ferns
for
mcguire
down
on
the
river
flat
the
doctor
drew
in
his
horse
miss
barner
he
said
lifting
his
hat
if
daniel
mulcahey
watson
and
i
should
ask
you
to
come
for
a
drive
with
us
i
wonder
what
you
would
say
miss
barner
considered
for
a
moment
and
then
said
smiling
i
think
i
would
say
you
very
much
watson
and
clay
i
shall
be
delighted
to
come
if
you
have
room
for
me
life
had
been
easier
for
mary
barner
since
clay
had
come
to
millford
it
was
no
longer
necessary
for
her
to
compel
her
father
to
go
when
he
was
sent
for
and
when
patients
came
to
the
office
if
she
thought
her
father
did
not
know
what
he
was
doing
she
got
clay
to
check
over
the
prescriptions
it
had
been
rather
hard
for
mary
to
ask
him
to
do
this
for
she
had
a
fair
share
of
her
father
scotch
pride
but
she
had
done
too
many
hard
things
in
her
life
to
hesitate
now
the
young
doctor
was
genuinely
glad
to
serve
her
and
he
made
her
feel
that
she
was
conferring
instead
of
asking
a
favour
they
drove
along
the
high
bank
that
fell
perpendicularly
to
the
river
below
and
looked
down
at
the
harvest
scene
that
lay
beneath
them
the
air
was
full
of
the
perfume
of
many
flowers
and
the
chatter
of
birds
the
reverend
hugh
grantley
drove
swiftly
by
them
whereupon
danny
made
his
presence
known
for
the
first
time
by
the
apparently
irrelevant
remark
i
know
who
miss
barner
fellow
is
so
i
do
now
if
clay
had
given
danny
even
slight
encouragement
he
would
have
pursued
the
subject
and
that
might
have
saved
complications
in
the
days
to
come
chapter
xii
from
camilla
diary
it
is
nearly
six
months
since
i
came
to
live
with
francis
and
i
like
housework
so
well
and
am
so
happy
at
it
that
it
shows
clearly
that
i
am
not
a
disguised
heiress
my
proud
spirit
does
not
chafe
a
bit
at
having
to
serve
meals
and
wear
a
cap
you
should
see
how
sweet
i
look
in
a
cap
i
have
got
the
fear
on
my
heart
all
day
that
i
will
make
a
mistake
in
a
figure
that
will
rise
up
and
condemn
me
at
the
end
of
the
month
as
i
used
to
be
when
i
was
on
a
high
stool
for
the
western
hail
and
fire
insurance
company
peace
to
its
ashes
all
work
is
expression
fra
elbertus
says
so
why
may
i
not
express
myself
in
blueberry
pie
and
tomato
soup
francis
is
an
appreciative
mistress
and
she
is
not
so
entirely
wrapped
up
in
browning
as
to
be
insensible
to
a
good
salad
either
i
am
glad
to
say
one
night
after
we
had
company
and
everything
had
gone
off
well
francis
came
out
into
the
kitchen
and
looked
over
his
glasses
at
me
he
opened
his
mouth
twice
to
speak
but
seemed
to
change
his
mind
i
knew
what
was
struggling
for
utterance
then
he
laid
fifty
cents
on
the
window
sill
pointed
at
it
nodded
to
me
and
went
out
hurriedly
my
first
impulse
was
to
hand
it
back
then
i
thought
better
of
it
words
do
not
come
easily
to
him
so
he
expressed
himself
in
currency
i
put
the
money
into
my
purse
for
a
luck
penny
francis
is
as
serene
as
a
summer
sea
and
can
look
at
you
without
knowing
you
are
there
francis
is
a
peaceful
man
too
he
looks
at
his
wife
in
a
helpless
way
when
she
begins
to
explain
the
difference
between
the
elizabethan
and
the
victorian
poets
i
do
believe
he
cares
a
cent
for
either
of
them
francis
entertains
quite
a
bit
i
like
it
too
and
i
do
not
go
and
cry
into
the
sink
because
i
have
to
wait
on
the
guests
she
entertains
well
and
is
a
delightful
hostess
but
some
of
the
people
whom
she
entertains
do
not
appreciate
her
flights
of
fancy
i
do
not
like
to
see
them
wink
at
each
other
although
i
know
it
is
funny
to
hear
francis
elaborate
on
the
mother
influence
in
the
home
and
the
proper
way
to
deal
with
selfishness
in
children
but
she
means
well
and
they
should
remember
that
no
matter
how
funny
she
gets
april
she
gave
me
a
surprise
she
called
me
upstairs
and
read
to
me
a
paper
she
was
preparing
to
read
before
some
society
she
belongs
to
three
or
four
on
the
domestic
help
problem
well
it
very
much
to
do
with
the
domestic
help
problem
but
of
course
i
could
not
tell
her
that
so
when
she
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
it
i
said
if
all
employers
were
as
kind
as
you
and
francis
there
would
be
no
domestic
help
problem
she
looked
at
me
suddenly
and
something
seemed
to
strike
her
i
believe
it
came
to
her
that
i
was
a
creature
of
like
passions
with
herself
capable
of
gratitude
perhaps
in
need
of
encouragement
hitherto
i
think
she
has
regarded
me
as
a
porridge
and
coffee
machine
she
put
her
arm
around
me
and
kissed
me
camilla
she
said
gently
she
has
the
softest
dreamiest
voice
i
ever
heard
i
believe
in
the
aristocracy
of
brains
and
virtue
you
have
both
farewell
oh
soulless
corporation
a
long
last
lingering
farewell
for
camilla
rose
who
used
to
sit
upon
the
high
stool
and
add
figures
for
you
at
ten
dollars
a
week
is
far
away
making
toast
for
two
kindly
souls
one
of
whom
tells
her
she
has
brains
and
virtue
and
the
other
one
opens
his
mouth
to
speak
and
then
pushes
fifty
cents
at
her
instead
danny
watson
bless
his
heart
is
bringing
madam
up
he
has
wound
himself
into
her
heart
and
the
whyness
of
the
what
is
packing
up
to
go
may
mrs
francis
is
going
silly
over
danny
a
few
days
ago
she
asked
me
if
i
could
cut
a
pattern
for
a
pair
of
pants
i
told
her
i
had
made
pants
once
or
twice
and
meekly
inquired
whom
she
wanted
the
pants
for
she
said
for
a
boy
of
course
and
she
looked
at
me
rather
severely
i
knew
they
must
be
for
danny
and
cut
the
pattern
about
the
size
for
him
she
went
into
the
and
i
only
saw
her
at
meal
times
for
two
days
she
wrestled
with
the
garment
last
night
she
asked
me
if
i
would
take
a
parcel
to
danny
with
her
love
i
was
glad
to
go
for
i
was
just
dying
to
see
how
she
had
got
along
when
i
held
them
up
before
watson
the
poor
woman
gasped
save
us
all
she
cried
them
fit
none
of
us
we
poor
but
thank
god
we
not
deformed
i
never
forget
the
look
of
those
pants
they
haunt
me
still
may
pearl
watson
is
the
sweetest
and
best
little
girl
i
know
her
gratitude
for
even
the
smallest
kindness
makes
me
want
to
cry
she
told
me
the
other
day
she
was
sure
danny
was
going
to
be
a
doctor
she
bases
her
hopes
on
the
questions
that
danny
asks
how
do
you
know
you
have
got
a
gizzard
how
would
you
like
to
be
ripped
clean
up
the
back
and
where
does
your
lap
go
to
when
you
stand
up
she
said
ma
and
us
all
have
hopes
o
danny
francis
has
a
new
role
that
of
matchmaker
though
i
do
suppose
she
knows
it
she
had
mary
barner
and
the
young
minister
for
tea
mary
grows
dearer
and
sweeter
every
day
people
say
it
is
not
often
one
girl
praises
another
but
mary
is
a
dear
little
saint
with
the
most
shapely
hands
i
ever
saw
reverend
hugh
thinks
so
too
i
have
no
doubt
it
was
really
too
bad
to
waste
a
good
fruit
salad
on
him
though
for
i
know
he
did
know
what
he
was
eating
excelsior
would
taste
like
ambrosia
to
him
if
mary
sat
opposite
all
of
which
is
very
much
as
it
should
be
i
know
i
thought
for
a
while
mary
liked
clay
pretty
well
but
i
know
it
is
not
serious
for
she
talks
quite
freely
of
him
she
is
very
grateful
to
him
for
helping
her
so
often
with
her
father
but
those
scotch
people
never
talk
of
what
is
nearest
the
heart
i
wonder
if
he
knows
that
mary
barner
is
a
queen
among
women
i
do
like
scotchmen
they
take
too
much
for
granted
chapter
xiii
the
fifth
son
arthur
wemyss
fifth
son
of
the
reverend
alfred
austin
wemyss
rector
of
agnes
tilbury
road
county
of
kent
england
had
but
recently
crossed
the
ocean
he
and
six
hundred
other
fifth
sons
of
rectors
and
earls
and
dukes
had
crossed
the
ocean
in
the
same
ship
and
had
been
scattered
abroad
over
manitoba
and
the
northwest
territories
to
be
instructed
in
agricultural
pursuits
by
the
honest
granger
and
incidentally
to
furnish
nutriment
for
the
mosquito
or
wasp
who
regarded
all
old
country
men
as
their
lawful
meat
the
honest
granger
was
paid
a
sum
varying
between
fifty
and
one
hundred
fifty
dollars
for
instructing
one
of
these
young
fellows
in
farming
for
one
year
and
although
having
an
englishman
was
known
to
be
a
pretty
good
investment
the
farmers
usually
spoke
of
them
as
they
would
of
the
or
the
rust
in
the
wheat
sam
motherwell
referred
to
his
quite
often
as
that
blamed
englishman
and
often
said
unjustly
that
he
was
losing
money
on
him
every
day
arthur
the
motherwells
could
not
have
told
his
other
name
had
learned
something
since
he
came
he
could
pull
for
the
pigs
and
throw
it
into
the
pen
he
had
learned
to
detect
in
the
grain
he
could
milk
he
could
turn
the
he
could
wash
dishes
and
churn
and
he
did
it
all
with
a
willingness
a
cheerfulness
that
would
have
appealed
favourably
to
almost
any
other
farmer
in
the
neighbourhood
but
the
lines
had
fallen
to
arthur
in
a
stony
place
and
his
employer
did
not
notice
him
at
all
unless
to
find
fault
with
him
yet
he
bore
it
all
with
good
humour
he
had
come
to
canada
to
learn
to
farm
the
only
real
grievance
he
had
was
that
he
could
not
get
his
tub
the
night
he
arrived
dusty
and
after
his
long
journey
he
had
asked
for
his
tub
but
motherwell
had
told
him
in
language
he
had
never
heard
before
that
there
was
no
tub
of
his
around
the
establishment
that
he
knew
of
and
that
he
could
go
down
and
have
a
dip
in
the
river
on
sunday
if
he
wanted
to
then
he
had
conducted
him
with
the
lantern
to
his
bed
in
the
loft
of
the
granary
a
rickety
ladder
led
up
to
the
bed
which
was
upon
a
temporary
floor
laid
about
half
way
across
the
width
of
the
granary
bags
of
musty
smelling
wheat
stood
at
one
end
of
this
little
room
evidently
motherwell
wished
to
discourage
in
his
hired
help
for
the
floor
ended
abruptly
and
a
careless
somnambulist
would
be
precipitated
on
the
old
fanning
mill
harrow
teeth
and
other
debris
which
littered
the
floor
below
the
young
englishman
reeled
unsteadily
going
up
the
ladder
he
could
still
feel
the
of
the
ocean
liner
engines
and
had
to
hold
tight
to
the
ladder
splintered
rungs
to
preserve
his
equilibrium
motherwell
raised
the
lantern
with
sudden
interest
say
he
said
more
cheerfully
than
he
had
yet
spoken
you
been
drinking
have
you
intoxicants
do
you
mean
the
englishman
asked
without
turning
around
no
i
do
not
drink
you
did
happen
to
bring
anything
over
with
you
did
you
for
seasickness
on
the
boat
motherwell
queried
anxiously
holding
the
lantern
above
his
head
no
i
did
not
the
young
man
said
laconically
turn
out
at
five
morning
then
his
employer
snapped
in
evident
disappointment
and
he
lowered
the
lantern
so
quickly
that
it
went
out
the
young
man
lay
down
upon
his
hard
bed
his
utter
weariness
was
a
blessing
to
him
that
night
for
not
even
the
racing
mice
the
musty
smells
or
the
hardness
of
his
straw
bed
could
keep
him
from
slumber
in
what
seemed
to
him
but
a
few
minutes
he
was
awakened
by
a
loud
knocking
on
the
door
below
voices
shouted
a
dog
barked
jangled
he
could
hear
doors
banging
everywhere
a
faint
streak
of
sunlight
lay
wan
and
pale
on
the
walls
by
jove
he
said
yawning
i
know
now
what
kipling
meant
when
he
said
dawn
comes
up
like
thunder
a
few
weeks
after
arthur
arrival
motherwell
called
him
from
the
barn
where
he
sat
industriously
mending
bags
to
unhitch
her
horse
from
the
buggy
she
had
just
driven
home
from
millford
nobody
had
taken
the
trouble
to
show
arthur
how
it
was
done
any
fool
ought
to
know
motherwell
said
arthur
came
running
from
the
barn
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
he
grasped
the
horse
firmly
by
the
bridle
and
led
him
toward
the
barn
as
they
came
near
the
water
trough
the
horse
began
to
show
signs
of
thirst
arthur
led
him
to
the
trough
but
the
horse
tossed
his
head
and
was
unable
to
get
it
near
the
water
on
account
of
the
check
arthur
watched
him
a
few
moments
with
gathering
perplexity
i
ca
lift
this
water
vessel
he
said
looking
at
the
horse
reproachfully
it
too
heavy
do
you
know
hold
i
have
it
he
cried
with
exultation
beaming
in
his
face
and
making
a
dash
for
the
horse
he
unfastened
the
crupper
but
the
exultation
soon
died
from
his
face
for
the
horse
still
tossed
his
head
in
the
vain
endeavour
to
reach
the
water
my
word
he
said
wrinkling
his
forehead
i
believe
i
shall
have
to
lift
the
yet
though
it
is
hardly
fit
to
lift
it
is
so
wet
and
nasty
arthur
spoke
with
a
deliciously
soft
kentish
accent
guiltless
of
r
and
with
a
softening
of
the
h
that
was
irresistible
a
light
broke
over
his
face
again
he
went
behind
the
buggy
and
lifted
the
hind
wheels
while
he
was
holding
up
the
wheels
and
craning
his
neck
around
the
back
of
the
buggy
to
see
if
his
efforts
were
successful
jim
russell
came
into
the
yard
riding
his
pony
chiniquy
he
stood
still
in
astonishment
then
the
meaning
of
it
came
to
him
and
he
rolled
off
chiniquy
back
shaking
with
silent
laughter
come
come
arthur
he
said
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
stop
trying
to
see
how
strong
you
are
do
you
see
the
horse
wants
a
drink
with
a
perfectly
serious
face
jim
unfastened
the
check
whereupon
the
horse
head
was
lowered
at
once
and
he
drank
in
long
gulps
the
water
that
had
so
long
mocked
him
with
its
nearness
oh
thank
you
russell
the
englishman
cried
delightedly
thanks
awfully
it
is
monstrously
clever
of
you
to
know
how
to
do
everything
i
wish
i
could
go
and
live
with
you
i
believe
i
could
learn
to
farm
if
i
were
with
you
jim
looked
at
his
eager
face
so
cruelly
bitten
by
mosquitoes
i
tell
you
arthur
he
said
smiling
i
have
any
need
for
a
man
to
work
but
i
suppose
i
might
hire
you
to
keep
the
mosquitoes
off
the
horses
they
would
look
at
chiniquy
i
am
sure
if
they
could
get
a
nip
at
you
the
englishman
looked
perplexed
you
are
learning
as
well
as
any
person
could
learn
jim
said
kindly
i
think
you
are
doing
famously
no
person
is
particularly
bright
at
work
entirely
new
do
be
a
bit
discouraged
old
man
you
be
a
rich
some
day
proprietor
of
the
wemyss
stock
farm
writing
letters
to
the
agricultural
papers
judge
of
horses
at
the
fairs
giving
lectures
at
dairy
institutes
oh
i
think
i
see
you
arthur
you
are
chaffing
me
arthur
said
smiling
indeed
i
am
not
i
am
very
much
in
earnest
i
have
seen
more
unlikely
looking
young
fellows
than
you
do
wonderful
things
in
a
short
time
and
just
to
help
along
the
good
work
i
am
going
to
show
you
a
few
things
about
taking
off
harness
that
may
be
useful
to
you
when
you
are
president
of
the
agricultural
society
of
south
cypress
or
some
other
fortunate
municipality
arthur
face
brightened
oh
thank
you
russell
he
said
that
night
arthur
wrote
home
a
letter
that
would
have
made
an
appropriate
circular
for
the
immigration
department
to
send
to
prospective
settlers
chapter
xiv
the
faith
that
moveth
mountains
when
supper
was
over
and
pearl
had
washed
the
heavy
white
dishes
motherwell
told
her
not
unkindly
that
she
could
go
to
bed
she
would
sleep
in
the
little
room
over
the
kitchen
in
polly
old
bed
you
do
need
no
lamp
she
said
if
you
hurry
it
is
light
up
there
motherwell
was
inclined
to
think
well
of
pearl
it
was
not
her
soft
brown
eyes
or
her
quaint
speech
that
had
won
heart
it
was
the
way
she
scraped
the
pearl
went
up
the
ladder
into
the
kitchen
loft
and
found
herself
in
a
low
long
room
close
and
stifling
one
little
window
shone
light
against
the
western
sky
and
on
it
innumerable
flies
buzzed
unceasingly
old
boxes
old
bags
old
baskets
looked
strange
and
shadowy
in
the
gathering
gloom
the
motherwells
did
not
believe
in
giving
away
anything
the
indians
who
went
through
the
neighbourhood
each
fall
looking
for
old
clo
had
long
ago
learned
to
pass
by
the
big
stone
house
indians
do
not
appreciate
a
strong
talk
on
shiftlessness
the
way
they
should
with
a
vision
of
a
long
cold
winter
ahead
of
them
pearl
gazed
around
with
a
troubled
look
on
her
face
a
large
basket
of
old
carpet
rags
stood
near
the
little
bed
she
dragged
it
into
the
farthest
corner
she
tried
to
open
the
window
but
it
was
nailed
fast
then
a
determined
look
shone
in
her
eyes
she
went
quickly
down
the
little
ladder
please
she
said
going
over
to
motherwell
i
ca
sleep
up
there
it
is
full
of
diseases
and
microscopes
it
what
motherwell
almost
screamed
she
was
in
the
pantry
making
pies
it
has
old
air
in
it
pearl
said
and
it
will
give
me
the
fever
motherwell
glared
at
the
little
girl
she
forgot
all
about
the
frying
pan
good
gracious
she
said
it
a
queer
thing
if
hired
help
are
going
to
dictate
where
they
are
going
to
sleep
maybe
you
like
a
bed
set
up
for
you
in
the
parlour
not
if
the
windies
ai
open
pearl
declared
stoutly
well
they
ai
there
has
been
a
window
open
in
this
house
since
it
was
built
and
there
is
going
to
be
letting
in
dust
and
flies
pearl
gasped
what
would
francis
say
to
that
it
in
yer
graves
ye
ought
to
be
then
she
said
with
honest
conviction
francis
told
me
never
to
sleep
in
a
room
with
the
windies
all
down
and
i
as
good
as
promised
i
would
ca
we
open
that
wee
windy
motherwell
was
tired
unutterably
tired
not
with
that
day
work
alone
but
with
the
days
and
years
that
had
passed
away
in
gray
dreariness
the
past
barren
and
bleak
the
future
bringing
only
visions
of
heavier
burdens
she
was
tired
and
perhaps
that
is
why
she
became
angry
you
go
straight
to
your
bed
she
said
with
her
mouth
hard
and
her
eyes
glinting
like
cold
flint
and
none
of
your
nonsense
or
you
can
go
straight
back
to
town
when
pearl
again
reached
the
little
stifling
room
she
fell
on
her
knees
and
prayed
dear
god
she
said
there
gurms
here
as
thick
as
hair
on
a
back
and
you
and
me

it

crook
so
mebbe

only
ye
have
to
watch
the
gurms
amen
pearl
braided
her
hair
into
two
little
pigtails
with
her
little
dilapidated
comb
when
she
brought
out
the
contents
of
the
and
opened
it
in
search
of
her
the
orange
rolled
out
almost
frightening
her
the
purse
too
rattled
on
the
bare
floor
as
it
fell
she
picked
it
up
and
by
going
close
to
the
window
she
counted
the
ten
pieces
a
whole
dollar
never
was
a
little
girl
more
happy
it
was
camilla
she
whispered
to
herself
oh
i
love
camilla
and
i
never
said
bless
camilla
with
a
sudden
pang
of
remorse
she
was
on
her
knees
in
a
moment
and
added
the
postscript
i
can
send
the
orange
home
to
ma
and
she
can
put
the
skins
in
the
chist
to
make
the
things
smell
nice
and
i
git
that
windy
open
clasping
her
little
purse
in
her
hand
and
with
the
orange
close
beside
her
head
she
lay
down
to
sleep
the
smell
of
the
orange
made
her
forget
the
heavy
air
in
the
room
anyway
she
murmured
contentedly
the
lord
is
attendin
to
all
that
pearl
slept
the
heavy
sleep
of
healthy
childhood
and
woke
in
the
gray
dawn
before
anyone
else
in
the
household
was
stirring
she
threw
on
some
clothing
and
went
down
the
ladder
into
the
kitchen
she
started
the
fire
secured
the
basin
full
of
water
and
a
piece
of
yellow
soap
and
came
back
to
her
room
for
her
oliver
i
ca
lave
it
all
to
the
lord
to
do
she
said
as
she
rubbed
the
soap
on
her
little
it
does
do
to
impose
on
good
nature
when
tom
the
only
son
of
the
motherwells
came
down
to
light
the
fire
he
found
pearl
setting
the
table
the
kitchen
swept
and
the
kettle
boiling
pearl
looked
at
him
with
her
friendly
irish
smile
which
he
returned
awkwardly
he
was
a
tall
rather
lad
of
twenty
he
had
heavy
gray
eyes
and
a
drooping
mouth
tom
had
gone
to
school
a
few
winters
when
there
was
not
much
doing
but
his
father
thought
it
was
a
great
deal
better
for
a
boy
to
learn
to
handle
horses
and
sample
wheat
and
run
a
binder
than
learn
the
pack
of
nonsense
they
got
in
school
nowadays
and
when
the
pretty
little
teacher
from
the
eastern
township
came
to
southfield
school
motherwell
knew
at
one
glance
that
tom
would
learn
no
good
from
her
she
was
such
a
flighty
looking
thing
flowers
on
the
under
side
of
her
hat
so
poor
tom
grew
up
a
clod
of
the
valley
yet
motherwell
would
tell
you
our
tom
be
the
richest
man
in
these
parts
he
get
every
cent
we
have
and
all
the
land
too
and
i
guess
there
wo
be
many
that
can
afford
to
turn
up
their
noses
at
our
tom
and
mind
ye
tom
can
tell
a
horse
as
well
as
the
next
one
and
he
a
boy
that
waste
nothin
not
like
some
we
know
look
at
them
slaters
now
fred
and
george
have
been
off
to
college
two
years
big
hulks
they
are
and
young
peter
is
going
to
the
agricultural
college
in
guelph
this
winter
and
the
old
man
will
hire
a
man
to
take
care
of
the
stock
and
him
with
three
boys
of
his
own
just
as
if
a
boy
can
learn
about
farmin
at
a
college
and
the
way
them
girls
dress
and
the
old
lady
too
and
her
not
able
to
speak
above
a
whisper
the
old
lady
wears
an
ostrich
feather
in
her
bonnet
and
they
a
terrible
costly
thing
i
hear
mind
you
they
only
keep
six
cows
and
they
send
every
drop
they
do
use
to
the
creamery
everybody
can
do
as
they
like
i
suppose
but
i
know
they
go
to
the
wall
and
they
deserve
it
too
and
yet
she
and
slater
had
been
girls
together
and
sat
in
school
with
arms
entwined
and
wove
romances
of
the
future
and
golden
when
they
consulted
the
oracle
of
tinker
tailor
soldier
sailor
rich
man
poor
man
beggar
man
thief
the
buttons
on
her
gray
winsey
dress
had
declared
in
favour
of
the
rich
man
then
she
had
dreamed
dreams
of
silks
and
satins
and
prancing
steeds
and
liveried
servants
and
ease
and
happiness
dreams
which
god
in
his
mercy
had
let
her
forget
long
long
ago
when
she
had
become
the
mistress
of
the
big
stone
house
she
had
struggled
hard
against
her
husband
penuriousness
defiantly
sometimes
and
sometimes
tearfully
but
he
had
held
her
down
with
a
heavy
hand
of
unyielding
determination
at
last
she
grew
weary
of
struggling
and
settled
down
in
sullen
submission
a
hopeless
spiritless
women
and
as
time
went
by
she
became
greedier
for
money
than
her
husband
pearl
said
brightly
are
you
tom
motherwell
that
what
tom
replied
only
you
need
mind
the
handle
pearl
laughed
all
right
she
said
i
want
a
little
favor
done
will
you
open
the
window
upstairs
for
me
why
tom
asked
staring
at
her
to
let
in
good
air
it
awful
close
up
there
and
i
afraid
i
get
the
fever
or
somethin
bad

tom
said

is
why

she
awful

but
i
do
believe

pearl
asked
eagerly
she
had
forgotten
her
own
worries
who
is
polly
did
she
live
here
she
in
the
hospital
now
in
brandon
tom
said
in
answer
to
her
rapid
questions
she
planted
them
poppies
out
there
but
she
never
seen
the
flowers
on
them
ma
wanted
me
to
cut
them

to
put
off
so
much
time
with
them
but
i
did
want
to
ma
was
mad
too
you
bet
he
said
with
a
reminiscent
smile
at
his
own
foolhardiness
pearl
was
thinking
she
could
see
the
poppies
through
the
window
bright
and
glowing
in
the
morning
light
they
rocked
lightly
in
the
wind
and
a
shower
of
crimson
petals
fell
poor
polly
she
had
seen
them
what
polly
other
name
she
asked
quickly
polly
bragg
he
answered
she
was
awful
nice
polly
was
and
jolly
too
ma
thought
she
was
lazy
she
used
to
cry
a
lot
and
wish
she
could
go
home
but
my
she
could
sing
fine
pearl
went
on
with
her
work
with
a
preoccupied
air
tom
can
you
take
a
parcel
for
me
to
town

said
in
surprise

a
month

in
surprise

the
preacher
was
sassy
to
pa
and
tried
to
get
money
pa
says
he

his
church

and

her
card
oh
but

expenses

pearl
said
doubtfully
she
was
wondering
about
the
boot
bills
pa
gets
a
dollar
and
a
quarter
every
day
and
ma
gets
cents
when
she
washes
we
gettin
on
fine
then
motherwell
made
her
appearance
and
the
conversation
came
to
an
end
that
afternoon
when
pearl
had
washed
the
dishes
and
scrubbed
the
floor
she
went
upstairs
to
the
little
room
to
write
in
her
diary
she
knew
francis
would
expect
to
see
something
in
it
so
she
wrote
laboriously
i
saw
a
lot
of
yalla
flowers
and
the
rode
was
full
of
dust
and
wagging
marks
i
met
a
man
with
a
top
buggy
and
smelt
a
skunk
made
a
kake
there
was
no
lickens
i
goin
to
tidy
up
the
granary
for
arthur
offel
nice
an
told
me
about
london
bridge
it
fallen
down
at
all
he
says
that
just
a
song
all
day
long
the
air
had
been
heavy
and
close
and
that
night
while
pearl
was
asleep
the
face
of
the
heavens
was
darkened
with
great
rolling
masses
came
up
from
the
west
shot
through
with
flashes
of
lightening
and
the
heavy
silence
was
more
ominous
than
the
loudest
thunder
would
have
been
the
wind
began
in
the
hills
gusty
and
fitful
at
first
then
bursting
with
violence
over
the
plain
below
there
was
a
cutting
whine
in
it
like
the
whang
of
stretched
steel
fateful
deadly
as
the
singing
of
bullets
chilling
the
farmer
heart
for
he
knows
it
means
hail
pearl
woke
and
sat
up
in
bed
the
lightning
flashed
in
the
little
window
leaving
the
room
as
black
as
ink
she
listened
to
the
whistling
wind
it
the
hail
she
whispered
delightedly
i
knew
the
lord
would
find
a
way
to
open
the
windy
without
me
puttin
my
fist
through
it
have
a
look
at
the
clouds
to
see
if
they
have
that
white
edge
on
them
no
i
wo
either
it
is
my
put
in
i
just
lave
the
lord
alone
nothin
makes
me
madder
than
when
i
promise
tommy
or
mary
or
any
of
them
something
and
then
have
them
frettin
all
the
time
about
whether
or
not
i
get
it
done
i
like
to
see
the
clouds
though
i
bet
they
a
sight
just
like
what
camilla
sings
about
dark
is
his
path
on
the
wings
o
the
storm
in
the
kitchen
below
the
motherwells
gathered
with
pale
faces
the
windows
shook
and
rattled
in
their
casings
keep
away
from
the
stove
tom
motherwell
said
trembling
that
where
the
lightnin
strikes
tom
teeth
were
chattering
this
fix
the
wheat
that
standing
every
bit
of
it
sam
said
he
did
not
make
it
quite
as
strong
as
he
intended
something
had
taken
the
profanity
out
of
him
had
you
better
go
up
and
bring
the
kid
down
ma
tom
asked
thinking
of
pearl
her
his
father
said
contemptuously
she
never
hear
it
the
wind
suddenly
ceased
not
a
breath
stirred
only
a
continuous
glare
of
lightning
then
crack
crack
crack
on
the
roof
on
the
windows
everywhere
like
bad
boys
throwing
stones
heavier
harder
faster
until
it
was
one
beating
thundering
roar
it
lasted
but
a
few
minutes
though
it
seemed
longer
to
those
who
listened
in
terror
in
the
kitchen
the
roar
grew
less
and
less
and
at
last
ceased
altogether
and
only
a
gentle
rain
was
falling
sam
motherwell
sat
without
speaking
you
have
cheated
the
lord
all
these
years
and
he
has
borne
with
you
trying
to
make
you
pay
up
without
harsh
proceedings
he
found
himself
repeating
the
words
could
this
be
what
he
meant
by
harsh
proceedings
certainly
it
was
harsh
enough
taking
away
a
man
crop
after
all
his
hard
work
sam
was
full
of
there
were
very
few
men
who
had
ever
been
treated
as
badly
as
he
felt
himself
to
be
maybe
there
only
be
a
streak
of
it
hailed
out
tom
said
breaking
in
on
his
father
dismal
thoughts
you
see
in
the
mornin
his
father
growled
and
tom
went
back
to
bed
when
pearl
woke
it
was
with
the
wind
blowing
in
upon
her
the
morning
breeze
fragrant
with
the
sweetness
of
the
flowers
and
the
ripening
grain
the
musty
odours
had
all
gone
and
she
felt
life
and
health
in
every
breath
the
blackbirds
were
twittering
in
the
oats
behind
the
house
and
the
rising
sun
was
throwing
long
shadows
over
the
field
scattered
glass
lay
on
the
floor
i
knew
the
dear
lord
would
fix
the
gurms
pearl
said
as
she
dressed
laughing
to
herself
but
her
face
clouded
in
a
moment
what
about
the
poppies
then
she
laughed
again
there
i
go
frettin
again
i
guess
the
lord
knows
they
there
and
he
is
going
to
smash
them
if
polly
really
needs
them
she
dressed
herself
hastily
and
ran
down
the
ladder
and
around
behind
the
cookhouse
where
a
strange
sight
met
her
eyes
the
cookhouse
roof
had
been
blown
off
and
placed
over
the
poppies
where
it
had
sheltered
them
from
every
hailstone
pearl
looked
under
the
roof
the
poppies
stood
there
straight
and
beautiful
no
doubt
wondering
what
big
thing
it
was
that
hid
them
from
the
sun
when
tom
and
his
father
went
out
in
the
early
dawn
to
investigate
the
damage
done
by
the
storm
they
found
that
only
a
narrow

through
the
field
in
front
of
the
house
had
been
touched
the
hail
had
played
a
strange
trick
beating
down
the
grain
along
this
narrow
path
just
as
if
a
mighty
roller
had
come
through
it
until
it
reached
the
house
on
the
other
side
of

not
one
trace

could

did
we
get
off

tom
exclaimed
and
the
rest
of
the
grain
is
not
even
lodged
why
dollars
would
cover
the
whole

all

was
looking
over

inasmuch
after
sundown
one
night
pearl
resolve
was
carried
into
action
she
picked
a
full
of
poppies
wrapping
the
stems
carefully
in
wet
newspaper
she
put
the
cover
on
and
wrapped
the
box
neatly
then
she
wrote
the
address
she
wrote
it
painfully
laboriously
in
round
blocky
letters
pearl
always
put
her
tongue
out
when
she
was
doing
anything
that
required
minute
attention
she
was
so
anxious
to
have
the
address
just
right
that
her
tongue
was
almost
around
to
her
ear
the
address
read
miss
polly
bragg
english
gurl
and
sick
with
fever
brandon
hospittle
brandon
then
she
drew
a
design
around
it
jimmy
teacher
had
made
them
once
in
jimmy
scribbler
just
beautiful
she
was
sorry
she
could
not
do
a
bird
with
a
long
strip
of
tape
in
his
mouth
with
think
of
me
or
from
a
friend
or
love
the
giver
on
it
ma
knew
a
man
once
who
could
do
them
quick
as
wink
he
died
a
drunkard
with
delirium
trimmings
but
was
terrible
smart
then
she
stuck
under
the
string
a
letter
she
had
written
to
camilla
camilla
would
get
them
sent
to
polly
i
know
how
to
get
them
sent
to
camilla
too
you
bet
she
murmured
there
are
two
ways
both
good
ones
too
jim
russell
is
one
way
jim
knows
what
flowers
are
to
folks
she
crept
softly
down
the
stairs
mrs
motherwell
had
left
the
kitchen
and
no
one
was
about
the
men
were
all
down
at
the
barn
she
turned
around
the
cookhouse
where
the
poppies
stood
straight
and
strong
against
the
glowing
sky
a
little
single
red
one
with
white
edges
swayed
gently
on
its
slender
stem
and
seemed
to
beckon
to
her
with
pleading
insistence
she
hurried
past
them
fearing
that
she
would
be
seen
but
looking
back
the
little
poppy
was
still
nodding
and
pleading
and
so
ye
can
go
ye
sweetheart
she
whispered
i
know
what
ye
want
she
came
back
for
it
just
like
danny
would
be
honin
to
come
if
it
was
me
she
murmured
with
a
sudden
blur
of
homesickness
through
the
pasture
she
flew
with
the
speed
of
a
deer
the
tall
sunflowers
along
the
fence
seemed
to
throw
a
light
in
the
gathering
gloom
a
night
hawk
circled
in
the
air
above
her
and
a
clumsy
bat
came
bumping
through
the
dusk
as
she
crossed
the
creek
just
below
shanty
bottles
jim
dog
jumped
up
and
barked
at
which
jim
himself
came
to
the
door
come
back
bottles
he
called
to
the
dog
how

ever
get
into

way
and
a
lady
too

glad
to

over
the
door
of
jim
little
house
the
words
happy

were
printed
in
large
letters
and
just
above
the
one
little
window
another
sign
boldly
and
hospitably
announced
hot
meals
at
all
hours
pearl
stopped
at
the
door

for

ai
they
jim
the
train
goes
at
ten
can
ye
do
it
jim
jim
was
brushing
his
hair
with
one
hand
and
reaching
for
his
coat
with
the
other
here
the
money
to
pay
for
the
ride
on
the
cars
pearl
said
reaching
out
five
of
her
coins
jim
waved
his
hand
that
my
share
of
it
he
said
pulling
his
cap
down
on
his
head
you
see
you
do
the
first
part
then
me
then
camilla
just
like
the
fiery
cross
he
was
half
way
to
the
stable
as
he
spoke
he
threw
the
saddle
on
chiniquy
and
was
soon
galloping
down
the
road
with
the
box
under
his
arm
camilla
came
to
the
door
in
answer
to
jim
ring
he
handed
her
the
box
and
lifting
his
hat
was
about
to
leave
without
a
word
when
camilla
noticed
the
writing
from
pearl
she
said
eagerly
how
is
pearl
come
in
please
while
i
read
the
letter
it
may
require
an
answer
camilla
wore
a
suit
of
brown
and
the
neatest
collar
and
tie
and
jim
suddenly
became
conscious
that
his
boots
were
not
blackened
camilla
left
him
in
the
hall
while
she
went
into
the
library
and
read
the
contents
of
the
letter
to
and
francis
she
returned
presently
and
with
a
pleasant
smile
said
holding
out
her
hand
you
are
russell
i
am
glad
to
meet
you
tell
pearl
the
flowers
will
be
sent
she
opened
the
door
as
she
spoke
and
jim
found
himself
going
down
the
steps
wondering
just
how
it
happened
that
he
had
not
said
one
word
he
who
was
usually
so
ready
of
speech
well
well
he
said
to
himself
as
he
untied
chiniquy
little
lost
his
tongue
i
wonder
why
all
the
way
home
the
vision
of
lovely
dark
eyes
and
rippling
brown
hair
with
just
a
hint
of
red
in
it
danced
before
him
chiniquy
taking
advantage
of
his
master
preoccupation
wandered
aimlessly
against
a
barbed
wire
taking
very
good
care
not
to
get
too
close
to
it
himself
jim
came
to
himself
just
in
time
to
save
his
leg
from
a
prod
from
the
spikes
chiniquy
chiniquy
he
said
gravely
i
understand
now
something
of
the
hatred
the
french
bear
your
illustrious
namesake
but
no
matter
what
the
man
sins
may
have
been
surely
he
did
not
deserve
to
have
a
little
mangey
treacherous
deceiver
like
you
named
for
him
when
camilla
had
read
pearl
letter
to
and
francis
the
latter
was
all
emotion
how
splendid
of
her
so
sympathetic
so
full
of
the
true
inwardness
of
christian
love
and
the
sweet
message
of
the
poppy
the
emblem
of
sleep
so
prophetic
of
that
other
sleep
that
knows
no
waking
is
it
not
a
pagan
thought
that
what
tender
recollections
they
will
bring
the
poor
sufferer
of
her
far
away
happy
childhood
home
francis
face
was
shining
with
emotion
as
she
spoke
then
she
became
dreamy
i
wonder
is
her
soul
attune
to
the
melodies
of
life
and
will
she
feel
the
love
vibrations
of
the
ether
francis
had
noiselessly
left
the
room
when
camilla
had
finished
her
rapid
explanation
he
returned
with
his
little
valise
in
his
hand
he
stood
a
moment
irresolutely
looking
in
his
helpless
dumb
way
at
his
wife
who
was
so
beautifully
expounding
the
message
of
the
flowers
camilla
handed
him
the
box
she
understood
francis
noticed
the
valise
in
her
husband
hand
how
very
suddenly
you
make
up
your
mind
james
she
said
are
you
actually
going
away
on
the
train
really
james
i
believe
i
shall
write
a
little
sketch
for
our
church
paper
thoughtfulness
has
moved
me
james
it
really
has
touched
me
deeply
if
you
were
not
so
engrossed
in
business
james
i
really
believe
it
would
move
you
but
men
are
so
different
from
us
camilla
they
are
not
so
soulful
perhaps
it
is
just
as
well
but
really
sometimes
james
i
fear
you
give
business
too
large
a
place
in
your
life
it
is
all
business
business
business
francis
opened
her
desk
and
drawing
toward
her
her
gold
pen
and
dainty
letter
paper
began
her
article
camilla
followed
francis
into
the
hall
and
helped
him
to
put
on
his
overcoat
she
handed
him
his
hat
with
something
like
reverence
in
her
manner
you
are
upon
the
king
business
she
said
with
shining
eyes
as
she
opened
the
door
for
him
he
opened
his
mouth
as
if
to
speak
but
only
waved
his
hand
with
an
impatient
gesture
and
was
gone
chapter

how
polly
went
home
we
have
to
move
poor
polly
if
she
lives
thro
the
night
the
nurse
said
to
the
house
doctor
in
the
hospital
that
night
she
is
making
all
the
patients
homesick
to
hear
her
calling
for
her
mother
or
for
from
is
hard
on
the
sick
and
well
what
are
her
chances
do
you
think
the
doctor
asked
gravely
he
was
a
wiry
little
man
with
a
face
like
leather
but
his
touch
brought
healing
and
his
presence
hope
she
is
dying
of
homesickness
as
well
as
typhoid
the
nurse
said
sadly
and
she
seems
so
anxious
to
get
better
poor
thing
she
often
says
ca
die
miss
for
what
happen
mother
but
for
the
last
two
days
in
her
delirium
she
seems
to
be
worrying
more
about
her
work
and
her
flowers
i
think
they
were
pretty
hard
people
she
lived
with
she
praise
me
this
time
she
often
says
tried
my
the
strenuous
life
has
been
too
much
for
poor
polly
listen
to
her
now
polly
was
singing
clear
and
steady
and
sweet
her
voice
rang
over
the
quiet
ward
and
many
a
fevered
face
was
raised
to
listen
polly
mind
was
wandering
in
the
shadows
but
she
still
sang
the
songs
of
home
in
a
strange
land
down
by
the
biller
there
grew
a
green
willer
a
weeping
all
night
with
the
bank
for
a
piller
and
over
and
over
again
she
sang
with
a
wavering
cadence
incoherently
sometimes
but
always
with
tender
pleading
something
about
where
the
stream
was
the
gentle
kine
lowin
and
over
my
grave
keep
the
green
willers
growin
it
is
pathetic
to
hear
her
the
nurse
said
and
now
listen
to
her
asking
about
her
poppies
in
the
box
miss
i
brought
the
seed
hacross
the
hocean
and
they
wuz

would

would
she
miss
she
could
the
i
think
no
indeed
she
has
cut
them
the
nurse
declared
with
decision
taking
polly
burning
hand
tenderly
in
hers
no
one
could
cut
down
such
beauties
what
nonsense
to
think
of
such
a
thing
polly
blooming
i
tell
you
red
and
handsome
almost
as
tall
as
you
are
polly
the
touched
the
nurse
arm
a
gentleman
who
gave
no
name
left
this
box
for
one
of
the
typhoid
patients
he
said
handing
her
the
box
the
nurse
read
the
address
and
the
box
trembled
in
her
hands
as
she
nervously
opened
it
and
took
out
the
contents
polly
polly
she
cried
excitedly
did
i
tell
you
they
were
blooming
red
and
handsome
but
polly
eyes
were
burning
with
delirium
and
her
lips
babbled
meaninglessly
the
nurse
held
the
poppies
over
her
her
arms
reached
out
caressingly
oh
miss
she
cried
her
mind
coming
back
from
the
shadows
they
have
come
at
last
the
darlin
the
sweethearts
the
loves
the
beauties
she
held
them
in
a
close
embrace
they
from
they
from
she
gasped
painfully
for
her
breath
came
with
difficulty
now
i
ca
just
see
them
miss
the
lights
is
movin
so
much
and
the

but
tell
me

there
a
little
silky
one
hedged
with
it
was
mother
favourite
one
of
hall
i
like
to
it
in
my
miss
the
nurse
put
it
in
her
hand
she
was
only
a
young
nurse
and
her
face
was
wet
with
tears
it
like
my
mother
miss
it
is
she
murmured
softly
ye
would
mind
the
dark
if
ye
yer
mother
would
ye
miss
and
then
the
nurse
took
polly
throbbing
head
in
her
strong
young
arms
and
soothed
its
restless
tossing
with
her
cool
soft
touch
and
told
her
through
her
tears
of
that
other
friend
who
would
go
with
her
all
the
way
i
that
miss
polly
murmured
faintly
it
like
i
was
say
that
again
about
the
valley
and
the
nurse
repeated
tenderly
that
promise
of
incomparable
sweetness
yea
though
i
walk
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
i
will
fear
no
evil
for
thou
art
with
me
thy
rod
and
thy
staff
they
comfort
me
it
just
like
mother
to
the
little
silky
one
polly
murmured
sleepily
the
nurse
put
the
poppies
beside
polly
face
on
the
pillow
and
drawing
a
screen
around
her
went
on
to
the
next
patient
a
case
of
urgent
need
detained
her
at
the
other
end
of
the
ward
and
it
was
not
until
the
dawn
was
shining
blue
in
the
windows
that
she
came
back
on
her
rounds
polly
lay
just
as
she
had
left
her
the
crimson
petals
lay
thick
upon
her
face
and
hair
the
homesickness
and
redness
of
weeping
had
gone
forever
from
her
eyes
for
they
were
looking
now
upon
the
king
in
his
beauty
in
her
hand
now
cold
and
waxen
she
held
one
little
silky
poppy
red
with
edges
of
white
polly
had
gone
home
there
was
a
whisper
among
the
poppies
that
grew
behind
the
cookhouse
that
morning
as
the
first
gleam
of
the
sun
came
yellow
and
wan
over
the
fields
there
was
a
whisper
and
a
shivering
among
the
poppies
as
the
morning
breezes
cold
and
chill
rippled
over
them
and
a
shower
of
crystal
drops
mingled
with
the
crimson
petals
that
fluttered
to
the
ground
it
was
not
until
pearl
came
out
and
picked
a
handful
of
them
for
her
dingy
little
room
that
they
held
up
their
heads
once
more
and
waved
and
nodded
red
and
handsome
chapter

egbert
and
edythe
when
tom
motherwell
called
at
the
millford
post
office
one
day
he
got
the
surprise
of
his
life
the
englishman
had
asked
him
to
get
his
mail
and
of
course
there
was
the
northwest
farmer
to
get
and
there
might
be
catalogues
but
the
possibilities
of
a
letter
addressed
to
thos
motherwell
did
not
occur
to
him
but
it
was
there
a
square
gray
envelope
with
his
own
name
written
on
it
he
had
never
before
got
a
real
letter
once
he
had
a
machinery
catalogue
sent
to
him
with
a
typewritten
letter
inside
beginning
dear
sir
but
his
mother
had
told
him
that
it
was
just
money
they
were
after
but
what
would
she
say
if
she
saw
this
he
did
not
trust
himself
to
open
it
in
the
plain
gaze
of
the
people
in
the
office
the
girl
behind
the
wicket
noticed
his
excitement
ye
need
glue
yer
eye
on
me
tom
thought
indignantly
i
not
open
it
here
for
you
to
watch
me
they
awful
pryin
in
this
office
what
do
you
bet
she
has
opened
it
he
moved
aside
as
others
pressed
up
to
the
wicket
feeling
that
every
eye
was
upon
him
in
a
corner
outside
the
door
tom
opened
his
letter
and
laboriously
made
out
its
contents
it
was
written
neatly
with
carefully
shaded
capitals
dear
tom

are
going
to
have
a
party

tom
read
it
again
with
burning
cheeks
a
party
at
slater
and
him
invited
he
walked
down
the
street
feeling
just
the
same
as
when
his
colt
got
the
prize
at
the
fair
he
felt
he
was
a

it
was

and
ma
were
right
money
talks
every
time
when
he
came
in
sight
of
home
his
elation
vanished
his
father
and
mother
would
not
let
him
go
he
knew
that
very
well
they
were
afraid
that
nellie
slater
wanted
to
marry
him
and
nellie
slater
was
not
eligible
for
the
position
of
nellie
slater
had
never
patched
a
quilt
nor
even
made
a
she
always
used
baking
powder
instead
of
cream
of
tartar
and
soda
and
was
known
to
have
a
leaning
toward
canned
goods
motherwell
considered
her
just
the
girl
to
spend
a
man
honest
earnings
and
bring
him
to
seedy
ruin
moreover
she
idled
away
her
time
teaching
cats
to
jump
and
her
eighteen
years
old
if
she
was
a
day
tom
knew
that
if
he
went
to
the
party
it
must
be
by
stealth
when
he
drove
up
to
the
kitchen
door
his
mother
looked
up
from
her
ironing
and
asked
what
kept
you
tom
tom
had
not
been
detained
at
all
but
motherwell
always
used
this
form
of
salutation
to
be
sure
tom
grumbled
a
reply
and
handing
out
the
mail
began
to
unhitch
motherwell
read
the
addresses
on
the
englishman
letters
arthur
wemyss
motherwell
millford
manitoba
canada
township
range
north
america
now
i
wonder
who
writing
to
him
she
said
laying
the
two
letters
down
reluctantly
there
was
one
other
letter
addressed
to
motherwell
which
she
took
to
be
a
twine
bill
it
was
brandon
she
put
it
up
in
the
pudding
dish
on
the
sideboard
as
tom
led
the
horse
to
the
stable
he
met
pearl
coming
in
with
the
eggs
see
here
kid
he
said
carelessly
handing
her
the
letter
tom
knew
pearl
was
to
be
trusted
she
had
a
good
head
pearl
had
for
a
girl
oh
good
shot
pearl
cried
delightedly
as
she
read
the
note
that
be
great
are
your
clothes
ready
though
it
was
the
eldest
of
the
family
who
spoke
clothes
tom
said
contemptuously
they
are
a
blamed
sight
readier
than
i
am
i
blacken
your
boots
pearl
said
and
press
out
a
tie
say
how
about
a
collar
oh
the
clothes
are
all
right
but
pa
and
ma
wo
let
me
go
near
nellie
slater
is
she
tooberkler
pearl
asked
quickly
not
so
very
tom
answered
guardedly
ma
is
afraid
i
might
marry
her
is
she
awful
pretty
pearl
asked
glowing
with
pleasure
here
was
a
rapturous
romance
you
bet
tom
declared
with
pride
she
the
swellest
girl
in
these
parts
this
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
weighed
many
feminine
charms
and
found
them
wanting
has
she
eyes
like
stars
lips
like
cherries
neck
like
a
swan
and
a
laugh
like
a
ripple
of
music
pearl
asked
eagerly
them
it
tom
replied
modestly
then
i
go
you
bet
was
pearl
emphatic
reply
there
your
mother
calling
yes
i
comin
i
help
you
tom
keep
a
stout
heart
and
all
will
be
well
pearl
knew
all
about
frustrated
love
ma
had
read
a
story
once
called
wedded
and
parted
and
wedded
again
cruel
and
designing
parents
had
parted
young
edythe
pronounced
and
egbert
and
egbert
just
pined
and
pined
and
pined
how
would
motherwell
like
it
if
poor
tom
began
to
pine
and
turn
from
his
victuals
the
only
thing
that
saved
egbert
from
the
silent
tomb
where
partings
come
no
more
was
the
old
doctor
who
used
to
say
keep
a
stout
heart
egbert
all
will
be
well
that
why
she
said
it
to
tom
edythe
had
eyes
like
stars
mouth
like
cherries
neck
like
a
swan
and
a
laugh
like
a
ripple
of
music
and
was
it
strange
nellie
slater
had
too
pearl
knew
now
why
tom
chewed
old
chum
tobacco
so
much
men
often
plunge
into
dissipation
when
they
are
crossed
in
love
and
maybe
tom
would
go
and
be
a
robber
or
a
pirate
or
something
and
then
he
might
kill
a
man
and
be
led
to
the
scaffold
and
he
would
turn
his
haggard
face
to
the
howling
mob
and
say
all
that
i
am
my
mother
made
me
say
would
that
make
her
feel
cheap
would
that
make
a
woman
feel
like
thirty
cents
if
anything
would
here
pearl
gloomy
reflections
overcame
her
and
she
sobbed
aloud
motherwell
looked
up
apprehensively
what
are
you
crying
for
pearl
she
asked
not
unkindly
then
oh
how
pearl
wanted
to
point
her
finger
at
motherwell
and
say
with
piercing
clearness
the
way
a
woman
did
in
the
book
i
weep
not
for
myself
but
for
you
and
for
your
children
but
of
course
that
would
not
do
so
she
said
i
ai
cryin
much
pearl
was
grating
that
afternoon
but
the
tears
she
shed
were
for
the
parted
lovers
she
wondered
if
they
ever
met
in
the
moonlight
and
vowed
to
be
true
till
the
rocks
melted
in
the
sun
and
all
the
seas
ran
dry
that
what
egbert
had
said
and
then
a
rift
of
cloud
passed
athwart
the
moon
face
and
edythe
fainted
dead
away
because
it
is
bad
luck
to
have
a
cloud
go
over
the
moon
when
people
are
busy
plighting
vows
and
was
it
a
good
thing
that
egbert
was
there
to
break
her
fall
pearl
could
just
see
poor
nellie
slater
standing
and
pale
at
the
window
wondering
if
tom
could
get
away
from
his
parents
who
dogged
his
every
footstep
and
pearl
tears
flowed
afresh
but
nellie
slater
was
not
standing
and
pale
at
the
window
did
you
ask
tom
motherwell
fred
her
brother
asked
looking
up
from
a
list
he
held
in
his
hand
i
sent
him
a
note
nellie
answered
turning
around
from
the
we
could
leave
tom
out
poor
boy
he
never
has
any
fun
and
i
do
feel
sorry
for
him
his
mother
wo
let
him
come
anyway
fred
said
smiling
so
set
your
heart
on
seeing
him
nell
how
discouraging
you
are
fred
nellie
replied
laughing
now
i
believe
he
will
come
tom
would
be
a
smart
boy
if
he
had
a
chance
i
think
but
just
think
what
it
must
be
like
to
live
with
two
people
like
the
motherwells
you
do
not
realise
it
fred
because
you
have
had
the
superior
advantages
of
living
with
clever
people
like
your
brother
peter
and
your
sister
eleanor
mary
is
that
so
peter
peter
slater
the
youngest
of
the
family
who
had
just
come
in
laid
down
the
before
replying
we
have
done
our
best
for
them
all
nellie
he
said
modestly
i
hope
they
will
repay
us
but
did
i
hear
you
say
tom
motherwell
was
coming
you
heard
nell
say
so
fred
answered
checking
over
the
names
nell
seems
to
like
tom
pretty
well
i
do
indeed
nellie
assented
without
turning
around
you
show
good
taste
eleanor
peter
said
as
he
washed
his
hands
who
is
going
to
drive
into
town
for
camilla
nellie
asked
that
evening
i
am
fred
answered
promptly
no
you
not
i
am
peter
declared
george
looked
up
hastily
i
am
going
to
bring
miss
rose
out
he
said
firmly
then
they
laughed
father
nellie
said
gravely
just
to
save
trouble
among
the
boys
will
you
do
it
with
the
greatest
of
pleasure
her
father
said
smiling
under
pearl
ready
sympathy
tom
began
to
feel
the
part
of
the
stricken
lover
and
to
become
as
eager
to
meet
nellie
as
egbert
had
been
to
meet
the
beautiful
edythe
he
moped
around
the
field
that
afternoon
and
let
arthur
do
the
heavy
share
of
the
work
the
next
morning
before
motherwell
appeared
pearl
and
tom
decided
upon
the
plan
of
campaign
pearl
was
to
get
his
sunday
clothes
taken
to
the
bluff
in
the
pasture
field
sometime
during
the
day
then
in
the
evening
tom
would
retire
early
watch
his
chance
slip
out
the
front
door
make
his
toilet
on
the
bluff
and
then
oh
bliss
away
to
edythe
pearl
had
thought
of
having
him
make
a
rope
of
the
sheets
but
she
remembered
that
this
plan
of
escape
was
only
used
when
people
were
leaving
a
place
for
good
such
as
a
prison
but
for
coming
back
again
perhaps
after
all
it
was
better
to
use
the
front
door
egbert
had
used
the
sheets
though
fortune
favoured
pearl
plans
that
afternoon
a
book
agent
called
at
the
back
door
with
the
prospectus
of
a
book
entitled
influence
in
the
home
while
he
was
busy
explaining
to
motherwell
the
great
advantages
of
possessing
a
copy
of
this
book
and
she
was
equally
busy
explaining
to
him
her
views
on
bookselling
as
an
occupation
for
an
man
pearl
secured
tom
suit
ran
down
the
front
stairs
out
the
front
door
and
away
to
the
bluff
coming
back
to
the
house
she
had
an
uneasy
feeling
that
she
was
doing
something
wrong
then
she
remembered
edythe
and
pale
and
her
fears
vanished
pearl
had
recited
once
at
a
band
of
hope
meeting
a
poem
of
her
own
choosing
this
was
before
the
regulations
excluding
secular
subjects
became
so
rigid
pearl
recitation
dealt
with
a
captive
knight
who
languished
in
a
mouldy
prison
he
begged
a
temporary
respite
his
prayer
was
heard
a
year
was
given
him
he
went
back
to
his
wife
and
child
and
lived
the
year
in
peace
and
happiness
the
hour
came
to
part
friends
entreated
wife
and
child
wept
the
knight
alone
was
calm
he
stepped
through
the
casement
a
proud
flush
on
his
cheek
casting
aside
wife
child
friends
what
are
wife
and
child
to
the
word
of
a
knight
he
said
and
behold
the
dawn
has
come
pearl
had
lived
the
scene
over
and
over
to
her
it
stood
for
all
that
was
brave
and
heroic
coming
up
through
the
weeds
that
day
she
was
that
man
her
step
was
proud
her
head
was
thrown
back
her
brown
eyes
glowed
and
burned
there
was
strength
and
grace
in
every
motion
when
tom
motherwell
furtively
left
his
father
house
and
made
his
way
to
the
little
grove
where
his
best
clothes
were
secreted
his
movements
were
followed
by
two
anxious
brown
eyes
that
looked
out
of
the
little
window
in
the
rear
of
the
house
the
men
came
in
from
the
barn
and
the
night
hush
settled
down
upon
the
household
and
motherwell
went
to
their
repose
little
dreaming
that
their
only
son
had
entered
society
and
worse
still
was
exposed
to
the
baneful
charms
of
the
reckless
young
woman
who
was
known
to
have
a
preference
for
baking
powder
and
canned
goods
and
curled
her
hair
with
the
curling
tongs

the
party
at
i
wonder
how
we
are
going
to
get
all
the
people
in
edith
slater
said
gravely
as
the
family
sat
at
supper
i
am
afraid
the
walls
will
be
bulged
out
the
new
and
the
cellar
will
do
for
the
overflow
meetings
george
remarked
i
borrow
the
pantry
if
it
comes
to
a
crush
you
and
i
camilla
peter
slater
said
helping
himself
to
another
piece
of
pie
camilla
had
come
out
in
the
afternoon
to
help
with
the
preparations
no
camilla
is
my
partner
fred
said
severely
peter
is
growing
up
too
fast
do
you
think
so
mother
since
i
lent
him
my
razor
to
play
with
there
no
end
to
the
airs
he
gives
himself
i
think
he
should
go
to
bed
at
eight
same
as
other
nights
peter
laughed
scornfully
but
nellie
interposed
you
boys
need
quarrel
over
camilla
for
jim
russell
is
coming
and
when
camilla
sees
him
what
chance
do
you
suppose
you
have
and
when
jim
sees
camilla
what
chance
will
you
have
nell
george
asked
not
one
in
a
hundred
but
i
am
prepared
for
the
worst
nellie
answered
that
means
she
has
asked
tom
motherwell
peter
explained
then
slater
told
them
to
hurry
along
with
their
supper
for
the
people
would
soon
be
coming
it
was
slater
who
had
planned
the
party
slater
was
the
leading
spirit
in
everything
in
the
household
that
required
dash
and
daring
hers
was
the
dominant
voice
though
nothing
louder
than
a
whisper
had
been
heard
from
her
for
years
she
laughed
in
a
whisper
she
cried
in
a
whisper
yet
in
some
way
her
laugh
was
contagious
and
her
tears
brought
comfort
to
those
with
whom
she
wept
when
she
proposed
the
party
the
girls
foresaw
difficulties
the
house
was
small
there
were
so
many
to
ask
it
was
a
busy
time
slater
stood
firm
ask
everybody
she
whispered
nobody
minds
being
crowded
at
a
party
i
was
at
a
party
once
where
we
had
to
go
outside
to
turn
around
the
house
was
so
small
i
never
forget
what
a
good
time
we
had
slater
was
dressed
and
ready
for
anything
long
before
the
time
had
come
for
the
guests
to
arrive
an
hour
before
he
had
sat
down
resignedly
and
said
come
girls
do
as
you
think
best
with
the
old
man
scrub
him
polish
him
powder
him
blacken
his
eyebrows
do
not
spare
him
he
yours
and
the
girls
had
laughingly
accepted
the
privilege
george
whose
duty
it
was
to
attend
to
the
lamps
for
the
occasion
came
in
with
a
worried
look
on
his
usually
placid
face
the
aristocratic
is
indisposed
he
said
it
has
balked
refuses
to
turn
up
and
smells
dreadfully
bring
in
the
plebeians
george
fred
cried
gaily
and
never
mind
the
patrician
the
plebs
never
fail
i
told
jim
russell
to
bring
his
lantern
and
peter
can
stand
in
a
corner
and
light
matches
if
we
are
short
it
working
now
edith
called
from
the
parlour
burning
beautifully
mother
drew
her
hand
over
it
soon
the
company
began
to
arrive
bashful
girls
some
of
them
were
old
before
their
time
with
the
marks
of
toil
heavy
and
unremitting
upon
them
and
awkward
these
were
the
daughters
of
rich
farmers
good
girls
they
were
too
conscientious
careful
unselfish
thinking
it
a
virtue
to
stifle
every
ambition
smother
every
craving
for
pleasure
when
they
felt
tired
they
called
it
laziness
and
felt
disgraced
and
thus
they
had
spent
their
days
working
working
from
the
gray
dawn
until
the
darkness
came
again
and
all
for
what
when
in
after
years
these
girls
broken
in
health
and
in
spirits
slipped
away
to
premature
graves
or
worse
still
settled
into
chronic
invalidism
of
what
avail
was
the
memory
of
the
cows
they
milked
the
mats
they
hooked
the
number
of
pounds
of
butter
they
made
not
all
the
girls
were
like
these
maud
murray
was
there
maud
murray
with
the
milkmaid
cheeks
and
curly
black
hair
the
typical
country
girl
of
bounding
life
aid
spirits
the
type
so
often
seen
upon
the
stage
and
so
seldom
elsewhere
motherwell
had
warned
tom
against
maud
murray
as
well
as
nellie
slater
she
had
once
seen
maud
churning
and
she
had
had
a
newspaper
pinned
to
the
wall
in
front
of
her
and
was
reading
it
as
she
worked
and
motherwell
knew
that
a
girl
who
would
do
that
would
come
to
no
good
martha
perkins
was
the
one
girl
of
whom
motherwell
approved
martha
record
on
butter
and
quilts
and
mats
stood
high
martha
was
a
nice
quiet
girl
motherwell
often
said
a
nice
quiet
unappearing
girl
martha
certainly
was
quiet
her
conversational
attainments
did
not
run
high
things
is
what
they
are
and
what
the
good
of
saying
anything
martha
had
once
said
in
defence
of
her
silent
ways
she
was
small
and
and
was
dressed
in
an
anaemic
gray
her
thin
hair
was
combed
straight
back
from
a
rather
fine
forehead
she
stooped
a
little
when
she
walked
and
even
when
not
employed
her
hands
picked
nervously
at
each
other
martha
shyness
the
unappearing
quality
was
another
of
her
virtues
in
the
eyes
of
tom
mother
martha
rarely
left
home
even
to
go
to
millford
martha
did
not
go
to
the
agricultural
fair
when
her
mats
and
quilts
and
butter
and
darning
and
buttonholes
on
cotton
got
their
red
tickets
martha
stayed
at
home
and
dug
potatoes
a
nice
quiet
unappearing
girl
when
they
played
games
at
the
slaters
that
evening
martha
would
not
play
she
never
cared
for
games
she
said
they
tired
a
person
so
she
would
just
watch
the
others
and
she
wished
again
that
she
had
her
knitting
then
the
kitchen
floor
was
cleared
table
chairs
and
lounge
were
set
outside
to
make
room
for
the
dancing
and
when
the
violins
rang
out
with
the
arkansaw
traveller
and
big
john
kennedy
in
his
official
voice
of
announced
select
your
partners
every
person
felt
that
the
real
business
of
the
evening
had
begun
tom
had
learned
to
dance
though
his
parents
would
have
been
surprised
had
they
known
it
out
in
the
granary
on
rainy
days
hired
men
had
obligingly
instructed
him
in
the
mysteries
of
the
and
waltz
he
sat
in
a
corner
and
watched
the
first
dance
when
jim
russell
came
into
the
hall
after
receiving
a
warm
welcome
from
and
slater
who
stood
at
the
door
he
was
conscious
of
a
sudden
thrill
of
pleasure
it
was
the
vision
of
camilla
at
the
farther
end
of
the
as
she
helped
the
slater
girls
to
receive
their
guests
camilla
wore
a
red
dress
that
brought
out
the
of
her
eyes
and
it
seemed
to
jim
as
he
watched
her
graceful
movements
that
he
had
never
seen
anyone
so
beautiful
she
was
piloting
a
bevy
of
bashful
girls
to
the
stairway
and
as
she
passed
him
she
gave
him
a
little
nod
and
smile
that
set
his
heart
dancing
he
heard
the
calling
for
partners
for
a
quadrille
the
fiddlers
had
already
tuned
their
instruments
from
where
he
stood
he
could
see
the
figures
forming
but
jim
watched
the
stairway
at
last
she
came
with
a
company
of
other
girls
none
of
whom
he
saw
and
he
asked
her
for
the
first
dance
jim
was
not
a
conceited
young
man
but
he
felt
that
she
would
not
refuse
him
nor
did
she
camilla
danced
well
and
so
did
jim
and
many
an
eye
followed
them
as
they
wound
in
and
out
through
the
other
dancers
when
the
dance
was
over
he
led
her
to
a
seat
and
sat
beside
her
they
had
much
to
talk
of
camilla
was
anxious
to
hear
of
pearl
and
it
seemed
all
at
once
that
they
had
become
very
good
friends
indeed
the
second
dance
was
a
waltz
tom
did
not
know
that
it
was
the
music
that
stirred
his
soul
with
a
sudden
tenderness
a
longing
indefinite
that
was
full
of
pain
and
yet
was
all
sweetness
martha
who
sat
near
him
looked
at
him
half
expectantly
but
her
little
gray
face
and
twitching
hands
repelled
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
nellie
slater
flushed
and
smiling
was
tapping
her
foot
to
the
music
he
found
himself
on
his
feet
who
cares
for
mats
he
muttered
he
was
beside
nellie
in
an
instant
nellie
will
you
dance
with
me
he
faltered
wondering
at
his
own
temerity
i
will
tom
with
pleasure
she
said
smiling
his
arm
was
around
her
now
and
they
were
off
one
two
three
one
two
three
yes
he
had
the
step
over
the
foam
we
glide
in
and
out
through
the
other
dancers
the
violins
weaving
that
story
of
love
never
ending
what
though
the
world
be
wide
nellie
head
was
just
below
his
face
love
golden
star
will
guide
nellie
hand
was
in
his
as
they
floated
on
the
drifting
along
glad
is
our
song
her
hair
blew
against
his
cheek
as
they
swept
past
the
open
door
what
did
he
care
what
his
mother
would
say
he
was
egbert
now
edythe
was
in
his
arms
while
we
are
side
by
side
the
violins
sang
glad
triumphant
that
old
story
that
runs
like
a
thread
of
gold
through
all
life
patterns
that
old
song
old
yet
ever
new
deathless
unchangeable
which
maketh
the
poor
man
rich
and
without
which
the
richest
becomes
poor
when
the
music
stopped
tom
awoke
from
his
idolatrous
dream
he
brought
nellie
to
a
seat
and
sat
awkwardly
beside
her
his
old
had
left
him
nellie
was
talking
to
him
but
he
did
not
hear
what
she
said
he
was
not
looking
at
her
but
at
himself
before
he
knew
it
she
had
left
him
and
was
dancing
with
jim
russell
tom
looked
after
them
miserable
she
was
looking
into
jim
face
smiling
and
talking
what
the
mischief
were
they
saying
he
tried
to
tell
himself
that
he
could
buy
and
sell
jim
russell
jim
had
not
anything
in
the
world
but
a
quarter
of
scrub
land
they
passed
him
again
still
smiling
and
talking
nellie
slater
is
making
herself
mighty
cheap
he
thought
angrily
then
the
thought
came
home
to
him
with
sudden
bitterness
how
handsome
jim
was
so
straight
and
tall
so
so
clever
and
bitterest
of
all
how
different
from
him
when
jim
and
camilla
were
sitting
out
the
second
dance
he
told
her
about
arthur
the
englishman
who
sat
in
a
corner
shy
and
uncomfortable
camilla
became
interested
at
once
and
when
he
brought
arthur
over
and
introduced
him
camilla
friendly
smile
set
him
at
his
ease
then
jim
generously
vacated
his
seat
and
went
to
find
nellie
slater
select
your
partners
for
a
square
dance
big
john
the
announced
when
the
floor
was
cleared
this
was
the
dance
that
and
slater
would
have
to
dance
it
was
in
vain
that
slater
whispered
that
she
had
not
danced
for
years
that
she
was
a
methodist
bred
and
born
that
did
not
matter
her
son
peter
declared
that
his
mother
could
dance
beautifully
jigs
and
hornpipes
and
things
like
that
he
had
often
seen
her
at
it
when
she
was
down
in
the
milkhouse
alone
slater
whispered
dreadful
threats
but
her
son
peter
insisted
and
when
big
john
voice
rang
out
honors
all
corners
the
same
slater
yielded
to
the
tide
of
public
opinion
puffing
and
blowing
she
got
through
the
first
four

tonald
was
a
crofter
from
the
hills
and
had
a
secret
still
of
his
own
which
made
him
a
sort
of
uncrowned
king
among
the
crofters
it
was
a
tight
race
for
popularity
between
mother
and
tonald
in
that
set
and
when
the
two
stars
met
face
to
face
in
the
balance
all
tonald
surpassed
all
former
efforts
he
cracked
his
heels
together
he
snapped
his
fingers
he
threaded
the
needle
he
wrung
the
dishcloth
oh
you
should
have
seen
tonald
then
big
john
clapped
his
hands
together
and
the
first
figure
was
over
in
the
second
figure
for
which
the
violins
played
my
love
is
but
a
lassie
yet
slater
memory
began
to
revive
and
the
dust
of
twenty
years
fell
from
her
dancing
experience
she
went

back
again

and
all
the
gentlemen
circled
to
the
right
no
one
was
quicker
to
see
what
was
the
upshot
of
it
all
and
before
big
john
told
them
to
form
the
basket
mother
whispered
to

that
she
knew

mother
wanted
to
quit
then
but
dear
me
no
no
one
would
let
her
they
would
dance
the
now
and
leave
out
the
third
figure
and
as
a
special
inducement
they
would
dance
dan
tucker
she
would
stay
for
dan
tucker
peter
came
in
for
tucker
an
extra
man
being
necessary
and
then
off
they
went
into
clear
the
way
for
old
dan
tucker
he
too
late
to
come
to
supper
two
by
two
they
circled
around
peter
in
the
centre
singing
old
dan
tucker
was
a
fine
old
man
then
back
to

he
washed

around
in

combed

hair

died
with
the
in
his
heel
as
they
let
go
of
their
partners
hands
and
went
right
and
left
peter
made
his
grand
dash
into
the
circle
and
when
the
turn
of
the
tune
came
he
was
swinging
his
mother
his
father
had
tonald
partner
and
tonald
was
in
the
centre
in
the
title
roll
of
tucker
executing
some
of
the
most
intricate
steps
that
had
ever
been
seen
outside
of
the
isle
of
skye
then
the
tune
changed
into
the
skirling
lilt
all
highlanders
love
and
which
we
who
know
not
the
gaelic
profanely
call
weel
may
the
keel
row
and
tonald
got
down
to
his
finest
work
he
was
in
the
byre
now
at
home
beyond
the
sea
and
it
is
not
strange
faces
he
will
be
seein
but
the
lads
and
lassies
of
the
glen
and
it
is
john
mcneash
who
holds
the
drone
under
his
arm
and
the
chanter
in
his
hands
and
the
salty
tang
of
the
sea
comes
up
to
him
and
the
is
in
his
nostrils
and
the
pipes
skirl
higher
and
higher
as
tonald
mckenzie
dances
the
dance
of
his
forbears
in
a
strange
land
they
had
seen
tonald
dance
before
but
this
was
different
for
it
was
not
tonald
mckenzie
alone
who
danced
before
them
but
the
incarnate
spirit
of
the
highlands
the
unconquerable
dauntless
lawless
highlands
with
its
purple
hills
and
treacherous
caverns
that
fling
defiance
at
the
world
and
fear
not
man
nor
devil
tonald
finished
with
a
leap
as
nimble
as
that
with
which
a
cat
springs
on
its
victim
while
the
company
watched
spellbound
he
slipped
away
into
a
corner
and
would
dance
no
more
that
night
when
twelve
came
the
dancing
was
over
and
with
the
smell
of
coffee
and
the
rattle
of
dishes
in
the
kitchen
it
was
not
hard
to
persuade
big
john
kennedy
to
sing
big
john
lived
alone
in
a
little
shanty
in
the
hills
and
the
prospect
of
a
good
square
meal
was
a
pleasant
one
to
the
lonely
fellow
who
had
been
his
own
cook
so
long
big
john
lived
among
the
crofters
whose
methods
of
cooking
were
simple
in
the
extreme
and
from
them
he
had
picked
up
strange
ways
of
housekeeping
he
ate
out
of
the
frying
pan
he
milked
the
cow
in
the
porridge
pot
and
only
took
what
he
needed
for
each
meal
reasoning
that
she
had
a
better
way
of
keeping
it
than
he
had
big
john
had
departed
almost
entirely
from
white
man
ways
and
lived
a
wild
life
free
from
the
demands
of
society
his
ability
to
call
off
at
dances
was
the
one
tie
that
bound
him
to
the
canadian
people
on
the
plain
oh
i
ca
sing
john
said
sheepishly
when
they
urged
him
tell
us
how
it
happened
any
way
john
bud
perkins
said
give
us
the
story
of
it
go
on
john
sing
about
the
cowboy
peter
slater
coaxed
it
iss
a
teffle
of
a
good
song
that
chuckled
tonald
well
john
began
clearing
his
throat
here
it
for
you
ruined
me
voice
drivin
oxen
though
but
here
the
song
it
was
a
song
of
the
plains
weird
and
wistful
with
an
uncouth
plaintiveness
that
fascinated
these
lonely
as
i
was
one
beautiful
morning
as
i
was
one
morning
in
may
i
saw
a
poor
cowboy
rolled
up
in
his
blanket
rolled
up
in
his
blanket
as
cold
as
the
clay
the
listener
would
naturally
suppose
that
the
cowboy
was
dead
in
his
blanket
that
lovely
may
morning
but
that
idea
had
to
be
abandoned
as
the
song
went
on
because
the
cowboy
was
very
much
alive
in
the
succeeding
verses
when
round
the
bar
bummin
where
bullets
were
he
snuffed
out
the
candle
to
show
why
he
come
then
his
way
of
giving
directions
for
his
funeral
was
somewhat
out
of
the
usual
procedure
but
no
one
seemed
to
notice
these
little
discrepancies
beat
the
drum
slowly
boys
beat
the
drum
lowly
boys
beat
the
dead
march
as
we
hurry
along
to
show
that
ye
love
me
boys
write
up
above
me
boys
here
lies
a
poor
cowboy
who
knows
he
done
wrong
in
accordance
with
a
popular
custom
john
spoke
the
last
two
words
in
a
very
slow
and
distinct
voice
this
was
considered
a
very
fine
thing
to
do
it
served
the
purpose
of
the
finis
at
the
end
of
the
book
or
the
let
us
pray
at
the
end
of
the
sermon
the
applause
was
very
loud
and
very
genuine
bud
perkins
who
was
the
wit
of
the
perkins
family
and
called
by
his
mother
a
regular
was
at
last
induced
to
sing
contained
verses
and
in
it
was
set
forth
the
wanderings
of
one
young
willie
who
left
his
home
and
native
land
at
a
very
tender
age
and
left
a
good
home
when
he
left
his
mother
tied
a
kerchief
of
blue
around
his
neck
god
bless
you
son
she
said
remember
i
will
watch
for
you
till
life
itself
is
fled
the
song
went
on
to
tell
how
long
the
mother
watched
in
vain
young
willie
roamed
afar
but
after
he
had
been
scalped
by
savage
bands
and
left
for
dead
upon
the
sands
and
otherwise
maltreated
by
the
world
at
large
he
began
to
think
of
home
and
after
shipwrecks
and
dangers
and
escapes
he
reached
his
mother
cottage
door
from
which
he
had
gone
long
years
before
then
of
course
he
tried
to
deceive
his
mother
after
the
manner
of
all
boys
returning
after
a
protracted
absence
oh
can
you
tell
me
ma
he
said
how
far
to
edinboro
town
but
he
could
not
fool
his
mother
no
no
she
knew
him
by
the
kerchief
blue
still
tied
around
his
neck
when
the
applause
which
was
very
generous
had
been
given
jim
russell
wanted
to
know
how
young
willie
got
his
neck
washed
in
all
his
long
meanderings
or
if
he
did
not
wash
how
did
he
dodge
the
health
officers
george
slater
gravely
suggested
that
perhaps
young
willie
used
a
process
french
chalk
or
brown
paper
and
a
hot
iron
peter
slater
said
he
did
not
believe
it
was
the
same
handkerchief
at
all
no
handkerchief
could
stand
the
pace
young
willie
went
it
was
another
one
very
like
the
one
he
had
started
off
with
he
noticed
them
in
the
window
as
he
passed
that
day
going
cheap
for
cash
the
young
englishman
looked
more
and
more
puzzled
it
was
strange
how
canadians
took
things
he
turned
to
camilla
it
is
only
a
song
do
you
know
he
said
with
a
distressed
look
it
is
really
impossible
to
say
how
he
had
the
kerchief
still
tied
around
his
neck
the
evening
would
not
have
been
complete
without
a
song
from
billy
mclean
little
billy
was
a
consumptive
playing
a
losing
game
against
a
relentless
foe
but
playing
like
a
man
with
unfailing
cheerfulness
and
eyes
that
smiled
ever
there
is
a
bright
ship
on
the
ocean
bedecked
in
silver
and
gold
they
say
that
my
willie
is
sailing
yes
sailing
afar
i
am
told
was
little
billy
song
known
and
loved
in
many
a
thresher
caboose
but
heard
no
more
for
many
a
long
day
for
little
billy
gave
up
the
struggle
the
next
spring
when
the
snow
was
leaving
the
fields
and
the
trickle
of
water
was
heard
in
the
air
but
he
and
his
songs
are
still
lovingly
remembered
by
the
boys
who
follow
the
mill
when
their
thoughts
run
upon
old
times
peter
and
fred
slater
came
in
with
the
coffee
jim
russell
with
a
white
apron
around
his
neck
followed
with
a
basket
of
sandwiches
and
tom
motherwell
with
a
heaping
plate
of
cake
did
you
make
this
cake
nell
tom
whispered
to
nellie
in
the
pantry
as
she
filled
the
plate
for
him
me
she
laughed
bless
you
no
i
ca
make
anything
but
pancakes
martha
perkins
still
sat
by
the
window
she
looked
older
and
more
careworn
she
was
thinking
of
how
late
it
was
getting
martha
could
make
cakes
tom
knew
that
martha
could
do
everything
go
along
tom
nellie
was
saying
give
a
piece
to
big
john
do
you
see
how
hungry
he
looks
their
eyes
met
hers
were
bright
and
smiling
he
smiled
back
oh
pshaw
pancakes
are
not
so
bad
jim
russell
whispered
to
camilla
as
he
passed
near
where
she
and
arthur
sat
will
you
please
come
and
help
nellie
in
the
pantry
we
need
you
badly
camilla
called
maud
murray
to
take
her
seat
she
knew
maud
would
be
kind
to
the
young
englishman
when
camilla
reached
the
pantry
she
found
nellie
and
tom
motherwell
happily
engaged
in
eating
lemon
tarts
and
evidently
not
needing
her
at
all
jim
was
ready
with
an
explanation
i
was
thinking
of
poor
thursa
far
across
the
sea
he
said
what
a
shock
it
would
be
to
her
if
arthur
was
compelled
to
write
home
that
he
had
changed
his
mind
and
camilla
did
not
look
nearly
so
angry
as
she
should
have
either
after
supper
there
was
another
song
from
arthur
wemyss
the
young
englishman
he
played
his
own
accompaniment
his
fingers
stiffened
though
they
were
with
hard
work
ran
lightly
over
the
keys
every
person
sat
still
to
listen
even
martha
perkins
forgot
to
twirl
her
fingers
and
leaned
forward
it
was
a
simple
little
english
ballad
he
sang
i
wander
over
land
or
foam
there
is
a
place
so
dear
the
heart
calls
home
perhaps
it
was
because
the
ocean
rolled
between
him
and
his
home
that
he
sang
with
such
a
wistful
longing
in
his
voice
that
even
his
dullest
listener
felt
the
in
it
it
was
a
song
of
one
who
reaches
longing
arms
across
the
sea
to
the
old
home
and
the
old
friends
whom
he
sees
only
in
his
dreams
in
the
silence
that
followed
the
song
his
fingers
unconsciously
began
to
play
mendelssohn
beautiful
air
we
would
see
jesus
for
the
shadows
lengthen
closely
linked
with
the
young
man
love
of
home
was
his
religious
devotion
the
quiet
sabbath
morning
with
its
silvery
chimes
calling
men
to
prayer
the
soft
footfalls
in
the
aisle
the
choir
his
father
voice
in
the
church
service
so
full
of
divine
significance
the
responses
and
the
swelling
notes
of
the
te
deum
he
missed
it
so
all
the
longing
for
the
life
he
had
left
all
the
spiritual
hunger
and
thirst
that
was
in
his
heart
sobbed
in
his
voice
as
he
sang
we
would
see
jesus
for
the
shadows
lengthen
this
little
landscape
of
our
life
we
would
see
jesus
our
weak
faith
to
strengthen
for
the
last
weariness
the
final
strife
we
would
see
jesus
other
lights
are
paling
which
for
long
years
we
have
rejoiced
to
see
the
blessings
of
our
pilgrimage
are
failing
we
would
not
mourn
them
for
we
go
to
thee
he
sang
on
with
growing
tenderness
through
all
that
divinely
tender
hymn
and
the
longing
of
it
the
prayer
of
it
was
not
his
alone
but
arose
from
every
heart
that
listened
perhaps
they
were
in
a
responsive
mood
easily
swayed
by
emotion
perhaps
that
is
why
there
was
in
every
heart
that
listened
a
desire
to
be
good
and
follow
righteousness
a
reaching
up
of
feeble
hands
to
god
the
reverend
hugh
grantley
would
have
said
that
it
was
the
spirit
of
god
that
stands
at
the
door
of
every
man
heart
and
knocks
the
young
man
left
the
organ
and
the
company
broke
up
soon
after
before
they
parted
slater
in
whom
the
englishman
singing
had
revived
the
spiritual
hunger
of
his
methodist
heart
requested
them
to
sing
god
be
with
you
till
we
meet
again
every
one
stood
up
and
joined
hands
martha
with
her
thoughts
on
the
butter
and
eggs
tonald
mckenzie
and
big
john
with
the
vision
of
their
lonely
dwellings
in
the

chapter

pearl
diary
when
pearl
got
tom
safely
started
for
the
party
a
great
weight
seemed
to
have
rolled
from
her
little
shoulders
tom
was
going
to
spend
the
night
what
was
left
of
it
with
arthur
in
the
granary

avoid
the
danger
of
disturbing
his
parents

brought
out
from

little
that

given
her

endeavoured
to
fill
some
of
its
pages

her
observations

told
her

write
what
she
felt

chapter
xx
tom
new
viewpoint
pearl
was
quite
disappointed
in
tom
appearance
the
morning
after
the
party
egbert
always
wore
a
glorified
countenance
after
he
had
seen
edythe
but
tom
looked
sleepy
and
somewhat
cross
he
went
to
his
work
discontentedly
his
mother
moroseness
annoyed
him
his
father
hard
face
had
never
looked
so
forbidding
to
him
as
it
did
that
morning
slater
hearty
welcome
her
motherly
smiles
slater
genial
and
kindly
ways
contrasted
sharply
with
his
own
home
life
and
it
rankled
in
him
it
dead
easy
for
them
slater
boys
to
be
smart
and
good
too
he
thought
bitterly
they
are
brought
right
up
to
it
they
may
not
have
much
money
but
look
at
the
fun
they
have
george
and
fred
will
be
off
to
college
soon
and
it
must
be
fun
in
the
city
they
dressed
up
all
the
time
ridin
round
on
street
cars
and
with
no
chores
to
do
the
trees
on
the
poplar
bluff
where
he
had
made
his
toilet
the
evening
before
were
beginning
to
show
the
approach
of
autumn
although
there
had
been
no
frost
pale
yellow
and
rust
coloured
against
the
green
of
their
hardier
neighbours
they
rippled
their
leaves
in
glad
as
he
drove
past
them
on
his
way
to
the
hayfield
the
sun
had
risen
red
and
angry
giving
to
every
cloud
in
the
sky
a
facing
of
gold
and
long
streamers
shot
up
into
the
blue
of
the
there
is
no
hour
of
the
day
so
hushed
and
beautiful
as
the
early
morning
when
the
day
is
young
fresh
from
the
hand
of
god
it
is
a
new
page
clean
and
white
and
pure
and
the
angel
is
saying
unto
us
write
and
none
there
be
who
may
refuse
to
obey
it
may
be
gracious
deeds
and
kindly
words
that
we
write
upon
it
in
letters
of
gold
or
it
may
be
that
we
blot
and
blur
it
with
evil
thoughts
and
stain
it
with
unworthy
actions
but
write
we
must
the
demon
of
discontent
laid
hold
on
tom
that
morning
as
he
worked
in
the
hayfield
new
forces
were
at
work
in
the
boy
heart
forces
mighty
for
good
or
evil
a
great
disgust
for
his
surrounding
filled
him
he
could
see
from
where
he
worked
the
big
stone
house
bare
and
gray
it
was
a
place
to
eat
in
a
place
to
sleep
in
the
same
as
a
prison
he
had
never
known
any
real
enjoyment
there
he
knew
it
would
all
be
his
some
day
and
he
tried
to
feel
the
pride
of
possession
but
he
could
not
he
hated
it
he
saw
around
him
everywhere
the
abundance
of
harvest
the
grain
that
meant
money
money
it
was
the
greatest
thing
in
the
world
he
had
been
taught
to
chase
after
it
to
grasp
it
then
hide
it
and
chase
again
after
more
his
father
put
money
in
the
bank
every
year
and
never
saw
it
again
when
money
was
banked
it
had
fulfilled
its
highest
mission
then
they
drew
that
wonderful
thing
called
interest
money
without
work
and
banked
it
oh
it
was
a
great
game
it
was
the
first
glimmerings
of
manhood
that
was
stirring
in
heart
that
morning
the
new
independence
the
new
individualism
before
this
he
had
accepted
everything
his
father
and
mother
had
said
or
done
without
question
only
once
before
had
he
doubted
them
it
was
several
years
before
a
man
named
skinner
had
bought
from
tom
father
the
quarter
section
that
jim
russell
now
farmed
paying
down
a
considerable
sum
of
money
but
evil
days
fell
upon
the
man
and
his
wife
sickness
discouragement
and
then
the
man
began
to
drink
he
was
unable
to
keep
up
his
payments
and
tom
father
had
foreclosed
the
mortgage
tom
remembered
the
day
the
skinners
had
left
their
farm
the
woman
was
packing
their
goods
into
a
box
she
was
a
faded
woman
in
a
faded
wrapper
and
her
tears
were
falling
as
she
worked
tom
saw
her
tears
falling
and
he
had
told
her
with
the
awful
cruelty
of
a
child
that
it
was
their
own
fault
that
they
had
lost
the
farm
the
woman
had
shrunk
back
as
if
he
had
struck
her
and
cried
oh
no
no
tom
say
that
child
you
do
know
what
you
say
then
putting
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
she
had
looked
straight
into
his
face
he
remembered
that
she
had
lost
some
teeth
in
front
and
that
her
eyes
were
sweet
and
kind
some
day
dear
she
said
when
you
are
a
man
you
will
remember
with
shame
and
sorrow
that
you
once
spoke
hard
to
a
homeless
woman
tom
had
gone
home
wondering
and
vaguely
unhappy
and
could
not
eat
his
supper
that
night
he
remembered
it
all
now
remembered
it
with
a
start
and
with
a
sudden
tightening
of
his
heart
that
burned
and
chilled
him
the
hot
blood
rushed
into
his
head
and
throbbed
painfully
he
looked
at
the
young
englishman
who
was
loading
the
hay
on
the
rack
with
a
sudden
impulse
but
arthur
was
wrapped
in
his
own
mask
of
insular
reserve
and
so
saw
nothing
of
the
storm
that
was
sweeping
over
the
boy
soul
then
the
very
spirit
of
evil
laid
hold
on
tom
when
the
powers
of
good
are
present
in
the
heart
and
can
find
no
outlet
in

they
turn
to
evil
tom
had
the
desire
to
be
kind
and
generous
ambition
was
stirring
in
him
his
sullenness
and
discontent
were
but
the
outward
signs
of
the
inward
ferment
he
could
not
put
into
action
the
powers
for
good
without
breaking
away
in
a
measure
at
least
from
his
father
and
mother
he
felt
that
he
had
to
do
something
he
was
hungry
for
the
society
of
other
young
people
like
himself
he
wanted
life
and
action
and
excitement
there
is
one
place
where
a
young
man
can
always
go
and
find
life
and
gaiety
and
one
door
stands
invitingly
open
to
all
when
the
church
of
god
is
cold
and
dark
and
silent
and
the
homes
of
christ
followers
are
closed
except
to
the
chosen
few
the
throws
out
its
evil
welcome
to
the
young
man
on
the
street
tom
had
never
heard
any
argument
against
intemperance
only
that
it
was
expensive
now
he
hated
all
the
petty
meanness
that
he
had
been
so
carefully
taught
the
first
evening
that
tom
went
into
the
of
the
millford
hotel
he
was
given
a
royal
welcome
they
were
a
jolly
crowd
they
knew
how
to
enjoy
life
tom
told
himself
what
the
good
of
money
if
you
have
a
little
fun
with
it
tom
had
never
had
much
money
of
his
own
he
had
never
needed
it
or
thought
anything
about
it
now
the
injustice
of
it
rankled
in
him
he
had
to
have
money
it
was
his
he
worked
for
it
he
would
just
take
it
and
then
if
it
was
missed
he
would
tell
his
father
and
mother
that
he
had
taken
it
taking
your
own
is
not
stealing
and
he
would
tell
them
so
and
have
it
out
with
them
thus
the
enemy
sowed

a
crack
in
the
granite
while
pearl
was
writing
her
experiences
in
her
little
red
book
and
motherwell
were
in
the
kitchen
below
reading
a
letter
which
motherwell
had
just
brought
from
the
post
office
it
read
as
follows
brandon
hospital
august
dear
and
motherwell
i
know
it
will
be
at
least
some
slight
comfort
for
you
to
know
that
the
poppies
you
sent
polly
reached
her
in
time
to
be
the
very
greatest
comfort
to
her
her
joy
at
seeing
them
and
holding
them
in
her
hands
would
have
been
your
reward
if
you
could
have
seen
it
and
although
she
had
been
delirious
up
to
that
time
for
several
days
the
sight
of
the
poppies
seemed
to
call
her
mind
back
she
died
very
peacefully
and
happily
at
daybreak
this
morning
she
was
a
sweet
and
lovable
girl
and
we
had
all
grown
very
fond
of
her
as
i
am
sure
you
did
too
may
god
abundantly
bless
you
dear
and
motherwell
for
your
kind
thoughtfulness
to
this
poor
lonely
girl
inasmuch
as
ye
have
done
it
unto
the
least
of
these
ye
have
done
it
unto
me
yours
cordially
nurse

sam
motherwell
took
the
letter
from
his
wife
hand
and
excitedly
read
it
over
to
himself
going
over
each
word
with
his
blunt
forefinger
he
turned
it
over
and
examined
the
seal
he
looked
at
the
stamp
and
inside
of
the
envelope
and
failing
to
find
any
clue
to
the
mystery
he
ejaculated
again
by
jinks
what
the
deuce
is
this
about
poppies
is
that
them
things
she
sowed
out
there
his
wife
nodded
well
who
do
you
suppose
sent
them
who
would
ever
think
of
sending
them
motherwell
made
no
reply
it
a
blamed
nice
letter
anyway
he
said
looking
it
over
again
i
guess
polly
did
give
us
a
hard
name
to
them
up
there
in
the
or
we
would
ha
got
a
letter
like
this
and
poor
dead
well
she
was
a
kind
of
a
willin
thing
too
and
not
too
slow
either
motherwell
was
still
silent
she
had
not
thought
that
polly
would
die
she
had
always
had
great
faith
in
the
vitality
of
english
people
you
ca
kill
them
she
had
often
said
but
now
polly
was
dead
she
was
sick
then
when
she
went
around
the
house
so
strangely
silent
and
flushed
motherwell
memory
went
back
with
cruel
distinctness
she
had
said
things
to
polly
then
that
stung
her
now
with
a
remorse
that
was
new
and
terrible
and
polly
had
looked
at
her
dazed
and
wondering
her
big
eyes
flushed
and
pleading
motherwell
remembered
now
that
she
had
seen
that
look
once
before
she
had
helped
sam
to
kill
a
lamb
once
and
it
came
back
to
her
now
how
through
it
all
until
the
blow
fell
the
lamb
had
stood
wondering
pleading
yet
unflinching
and
she
had
run
sobbing
away
and
now
polly
was
dead
and
those
big
eyes
she
had
so
often
seen
tearful
yet
smiling
were
closed
and
their
tears
forever
wiped
away
that
night
she
dreamed
of
polly
confused
troubled
dreams
now
it
was
polly
mother
who
was
dead
then
it
was
her
own
mother
dead
thirty
years
ago
once
she
started
violently
and
sat
up
someone
had
been
singing
the
echo
of
it
was
still
in
the
room
over
my
grave
keep
the
green
willers
growing
the
yellow
harvest
moon
flooded
the
room
with
its
soft
light
she
could
see
through
the
window
how
it
lay
like
a
mantle
on
the
silent
fields
it
was
one
of
those
glorious
cloudless
nights
with
a
hint
of
frost
in
the
air
that
come
just
as
the
grain
is
ripening
from
some
place
down
the
creek
a
dog
barked
once
in
a
while
a
tinkled
a
horse
stamped
in
the
stable
and
then
all
was
still
numberless
stars
shone
through
the
window
the
mystery
of
life
and
death
and
growing
things
was
around
her
as
for
man
his
days
are
as
grass
as
a
flower
of
the
field
so
he
flourisheth
for
it
is
soon
cut
off
and
we
fly
away
fly
away
where
where
her
head
throbbed
with
the
question
the
eastern
sky
flushed
red
with
morning
a
little
ripple
came
over
the
grain
she
watched
it
listlessly
polly
had
died
at
daybreak
the
letter
say
just
like
that
the
light
rising
redder
and
redder
the
stars
disappearing
she
wondered
dully
to
herself
how
often
she
would
see
the
light
coming
like
this
and
yet
and
yet
some
time
would
be
the
last
and
then
what
we
shall
be
where
suns
are
not
a
far
serener
clime
came
to
her
memory
she
knew
not
from
whence
but
she
shuddered
at
it
polly
eyes
dazed
pleading
like
the
lamb
rose
before
her
or
was
it
that
other
face
tender
that
had
been
looking
upon
her
in
love
all
these
long
years
she
spoke
so
kindly
to
pearl
when
she
went
into
the
kitchen
that
the
little
girl
looked
up
apprehensively
are
ye
not
well
she
asked
quickly
motherwell
hesitated
i
did
not
sleep
very
well
she
said
at
last
that
the
mortgage
pearl
thought
to
herself
and
when
i
did
sleep
i
had
such
dreadful
dreams
motherwell
went
on
strangely
communicative
that
looks
more
like
the
cancer
pearl
thought
as
she
stirred
the
porridge
we
got
bad
news
motherwell
said
polly
is
dead
pearl
stopped
stirring
the
porridge
when
did
she
die
she
asked
eagerly
the
morning
before
yesterday
morning
about
daylight
pearl
made
a
rapid
calculation
oh
good
she
cried
goody
goody
goody
they
were
in
time
she
saw
her
mistake
in
a
moment
and
hastily
put
her
hand
over
her
mouth
as
if
to
prevent
the
unruly
member
from
further
indiscretions
she
stirred
the
porridge
vigorously
while
her
cheeks
burned
yes
they
were
motherwell
said
quietly
pearl
set
the
porridge
on
the
back
of
the
stove
and
ran
out
to
where
the
poppies
nodded
gaily
never
before
had
they
seemed
so
beautiful
motherwell
watched
her
through
the
window
bending
over
them
something
about
the
poppies
appealed
to
her
now
she
had
once
wanted
tom
to
cut
them
down
and
she
thought
of
it
now
she
tapped
on
the
window
pearl
looked
up
startled
bring
in
some
she
called
when
the
work
was
done
for
the
morning
motherwell
went
up
the
narrow
stair
way
to
the
little
room
over
the
kitchen
to
gather
together
polly
things
she
sat
on
polly
little
straw
bed
and
looked
at
the
dismal
little
room
pearl
had
done
what
she
could
to
brighten
it
the
old
bags
and
baskets
had
been
neatly
piled
in
one
corner
and
quilts
had
been
spread
over
them
to
hide
their
ugliness
from
view
the
wind
blew
gently
in
the
window
that
the
hail
had
broken
the
floor
had
been
scrubbed
clean
and
white
the
window
what
was
left
of
it
was
shining
she
was
reminded
of
polly
everywhere
she
looked
the
mat
under
her
feet
was
one
that
polly
had
braided
a
corduroy
blouse
hung
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
she
remembered
now
that
polly
had
worn
it
the
day
she
came
in
a
little
yellow
tin
box
she
found
polly
letters
the
letters
that
had
given
her
such
extravagant
joy
she
could
see
her
yet
how
eagerly
she
would
seize
them
and
rush
up
to
this
little
room
with
them
transfigured
motherwell
would
have
to
look
at
them
to
find
out
polly
address
she
took
out
the
first
letter
slowly
then
hurriedly
put
it
back
again
in
the
envelope
and
looked
guiltily
around
the
room
but
it
had
to
be
done
she
took
it
out
again
resolutely
and
read
it
with
some
difficulty
it
was
written
in
a
straggling
hand
that
wandered
uncertainly
over
the
lines
it
was
a
pitiful
letter
telling
of
poverty
bitter
and
grinding
but
redeemed
from
utter
misery
by
a
love
and
faith
that
shone
from
every
line

dead
burst
from
motherwell
as
something
gathered
in
her
throat
she
laid
the
letter
down
and
looked
straight
ahead
of
her
the
sloping
walls
of
the
little
kitchen
loft
with
its
cobwebbed
beams
faded
away
and
she
was
looking
into
a
squalid
little
room
where
an
old
woman
bent
and
feeble
sat
working
buttonholes
with
trembling
fingers
her
eyes
were
restless
and
expectant
she
listened
eagerly
to
every
sound
a
step
is
at
the
door
a
hand
is
on
the
latch
the
old
woman
rises
uncertainly
a
great
hope
in
her
eyes
it
is
the
letter
the
letter
at
last
the
door
opens
and
the
old
woman
falls
cowering
and
moaning
and
wringing
her
hands
before
the
man
who
enters
it
is
the
officer
motherwell
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
oh
god
be
merciful
be
merciful
she
sobbed
sam
motherwell
knowing
nothing
of
the
storm
that
was
passing
through
his
wife
mind
was
out
in
the
machine
house
tightening
up
the
screws
and
bolts
in
the
binders
getting
ready
for
the
harvest
the
barley
was
whitening
already
the
nurse
letter
had
disturbed
him
he
tried
to
laugh
at
himself
the
idea
of
his
boxing
up
those
weeds
to
send
to
anybody
still
the
nurse
had
said
how
pleased
polly
was
by
george
it
is
strange
what
will
please
people
he
remembered
when
he
went
down
to
indiana
buying
horses
how
tired
he
got
of
the
look
of
and
how
the
sight
of
the
first
decent
sized
wheat
field
just
went
to
his
heart
when
he
was
coming
back
someway
he
could
not
laugh
at
anything
that
morning
for
polly
was
dead
and
polly
was
a
willing
thing
for
sure
he
seemed
to
see
her
yet
how
she
ran
after
the
colt
the
day
it
broke
out
of
the
pasture
and
when
the
men
were
away
she
would
hitch
up
a
horse
for
him
as
quick
as
anybody
i
kind
o
wish
now
that
i
had
given
her
something
it
would
have
pleased
her
so
some
little
thing
he
added
hastily
motherwell
came
across
the
yard
bareheaded
come
into
the
house
sam
she
said
gently
i
want
to
show
you
something
he
looked
up
quickly
but
saw
something
in
his
wife
face
that
prevented
him
from
speaking
he
followed
her
into
the
house
the
letters
were
on
the
table
motherwell
read
them
to
him
read
them
with
tears
that
almost
choked
her
utterance
and
polly
dead
sam
she
cried
when
she
had
finished
the
last
one
polly
dead
and
the
poor
old
mother
will
be
looking
looking
for
that
money
and
it
will
never
come
sam
ca
we
save
that
poor
old
woman
from
the
poorhouse
do
you
remember
what
the
girl
said
in
the
letter
as
ye
have
done
it
unto
the
least
of
these
my
little
ones
ye
have
done
it
unto
me
we
did
deserve
the
praise
the
girl
gave
us
we
did
send
the
flowers
we
have
never
done
anything
for
anybody
and
we
have
plenty
plenty
and
what
is
the
good
of
it
sam
we
die
some
day
and
leave
it
all
behind
us
motherwell
hid
her
face
in
her
apron
trembling
with
excitement
sam
face
was
immovable
but
a
mysterious
something
not
of
earth
was
struggling
with
him
was
it
the
faith
of
that
decrepit
old
woman
in
that
bare
little
room
across
the
sea
mumbling
to
herself
that
god
had
not
forgotten
god
knows
his
ear
is
not
dulled
his
arm
is
not
shortened
his
holy
spirit
moves
mightily
sam
motherwell
stood
up
and
struck
the
table
with
his
fist
ettie
he
said
i
am
a
hard
man
a
danged
hard
man
and
as
you
say
i
never
given
away
much
but
i
am
not
so
low
down
yet
that
i
have
to
reach
up
to
touch
bottom
and
the
old
woman
will
not
go
to
the
poor
house
if
i
have
money
enough
to
keep
her
out
sam
motherwell
was
as
good
as
his
word
he
went
to
winnipeg
the
next
day
but
before
he
left
he
drew
a
check
for
one
hundred
dollars
payable
to
polly
mother
which
he
gave
to
the
church
of
england
clergyman
to
send
for
him
about
two
months
afterwards
he
received
a
letter
from
the
clergyman
of
the
parish
in
which
polly
mother
lived
telling
him
that
the
money
had
reached
the
old
lady
in
time
to
save
her
from
the
workhouse
a
letter
of
thanks
from
polly
mother
herself
accompanied
it
calling
on
god
to
reward
them
for
their
kindness
to
her
and
her
dear
dead
girl

but
what
wrong
and
he
said
at
all
pearl
thank
you
but
i
know
there
is
you
know
how
polite
he
is
would
trouble
anybody
would
ask
ye
to
slap
on
the
back
if
he
was
chokin
i
went
out
two
or
three
times
and
once
i
brought
him
out
some
liniment
and
he
told
me
every
time
he
would
be
directly
but
i
do
believe
him
if
arthur
groans
there
something
to
groan
for
you
bet
maybe
he
in
love
tom
said
sheepishly
but
you
do
groan
tom
do
you
she
asked
seriously
maybe
i
ai
in
love
though
pearl
ask
jim
russell
he
can
tell
you
jim
ai
in
love
is
he
pearl
asked
anxiously
her
responsibilities
were
growing
too
fast
one
love
affair
and
a
sick
man
she
felt
was
all
she
could
attend
to
well
why
do
you
suppose
jim
comes
over
here
every
second
day
to
get
you
to
write
a
note
to
that
friend
of
yours
camilla
pearl
asked
tom
nodded
camilla
ca
leave
francis
pearl
declared
with
conviction
jim
a
dandy
smart
fellow
he
only
stays
on
the
farm
in
the
summer
in
the
winter
he
for
three
or
four
of
the
stores
in
millford
and
earns
lots
of
money
tom
said
admiringly
after
a
pause
pearl
said
thoughtfully
i
love
camilla
that
just
the
way
jim
feels
too
i
guess
tom
said
laughing
as
he
went
out
to
the
stable
when
tom
went
out
to
the
granary
he
found
arthur
dressing
but
flushed
and
looking
rather
unsteady
what
gone
wrong
with
you
old
man
he
asked
kindly
i
feel
a
bit
queer
arthur
replied
that
all
i
shall
be
well
directly
got
a
bit
of
a
cold
i
think
slept
in
a
field
with
the
gate
open
like
as
not
tom
laughed
arthur
looked
at
him
inquiringly
you
feel
better
when
you
get
your
breakfast
tom
went
on
i
wonder
you
sick
you
have
been
eatin
enough
to
keep
a
canary
bird
alive
go
on
right
into
the
house
now
i
feed
your
team
it
beats
all
what
happens
to
our
help
motherwell
complained
to
pearl
as
they
washed
the
breakfast
dishes
it
looks
very
much
as
if
arthur
is
goin
to
be
laid
up
too
and
the
busy
time
just
on
us
pearl
was
troubled
why
should
arthur
be
sick
he
had
plenty
of
fresh
air
he
tubbed
himself
regularly
he
never
drank
alcoholic
beverages
that
act
directly
on
the
liver
and
stomach
drying
up
the
blood
and
rendering
every
organ
unfit
for
work
pearl
remembered
the
band
of
hope
manual
no
and
it
was
not
a
cold
colds
do
not
make
people
groan
in
the
night
it
was
something
else
pearl
wished
her
friend
clay
would
come
along
he
would
soon
spot
the
trouble
after
dinner
of
which
arthur
ate
scarcely
a
mouthful
as
pearl
was
cleaning
the
knives
motherwell
came
into
the
kitchen
with
a
hard
look
on
her
face
she
had
just
missed
a
bill
from
her
satchel
pearl
she
said
in
a
strained
voice
did
you
see
a
bill
any
place
yes
pearl
answered
quickly
mrs
francis
paid
ma
with
one
once
for
the
washing
but
i
do
know
where
it
might
be
now
motherwell
looked
at
pearl
keenly
it
was
not
easy
to
believe
that
that
little
girl
would
steal
her
heart
was
still
tender
after
death
she
did
not
want
to
be
hard
on
pearl
but
the
money
must
be
some
place
pearl
i
have
lost
a
bill
if
you
know
anything
about
it
i
want
you
to
tell
me
she
said
firmly
i
do
know
anything
about
it
no
ye
say
ye
had
it
and
now
ye
lost
it
pearl
answered
calmly
go
up
to
your
room
and
think
about
it
she
said
avoiding
gaze
pearl
went
up
the
narrow
little
steps
with
a
heart
that
swelled
with
indignation
does
she
think
i
stole
her
dirty
money
me
that
has
money
o
me
own
a
thief
is
it
she
takes
me
for
oh
wirra
wirra
and
her
an
me
wuz
gittin
on
so
fine
too
and
like
as
not
this
start
the
morgage
and
the
cancer
on
her
again
pearl
threw
herself
on
the
hot
little
bed
and
sobbed
out
her
indignation
and
her
homesickness
she
could
not
put
it
off
this
time
catching
sight
of
her
face
in
the
cracked
looking
glass
that
hung
at
the
head
of
the
bed
she
started
up
suddenly
what
am
i
bleatin
for
she
said
to
herself
wiping
her
eyes
on
her
little
patched
apron
ye
think
to
look
at
me
that
i
been
caught
stealin
the
cat
milk
she
laughed
through
her
tears
i
stolen
anything
and
what
for
need
i
cry
the
dear
lord
will
get
me
out
of
this
just
as
nate
as
he
bruk
the
windy
for
me
she
took
her
knitting
out
of
the
and
began
to
knit
at
full
speed
danny
me
man
it
is
a
good
thing
for
ye
that
the
shaddah
of
suspicion
is
on
yer
sister
pearlie
this
day
for
it
gives
her
a
good
chance
to
turn
yer
heel
in
the
sunshine
sowin
in
the
shaddah
only
it
knittin
i
am
instead
of
sewin
but
it
all
wan
i
guess
i
mind
how
paul
and
silas
were
singin
in
the
prison
at
midnight
i
know
how
they
felt
what
ye
like
lord
they
wur
thinkin
it
in
jail
ye
want
us
to
stay
we
yer
men
pearl
knit
a
few
minutes
in
silence
then
she
knelt
beside
the
bed
dear
lord
she
prayed
clasping
her
hands
help
her
to
find
her
money
but
if
anyone
did
steal
it
give
him
the
strength
to
confess
it
dear
lord
amen
motherwell
downstairs
was
having
a
worse
time
than
pearl
she
could
not
make
herself
believe
that
pearl
had
stolen
the
money
and
yet
no
one
had
had
a
chance
to
take
it
except
pearl
or
tom
and
that
of
course
was
absurd
she
went
again
to
have
a
look
in
every
drawer
in
her
room
and
as
she
passed
through
the
hall
she
detected
a
strange
odour
she
soon
traced
it
to
tom
light
overcoat
which
hung
there
what
was
the
smell
it
was
tobacco
and
something
more
it
was
the
smell
of
a
she
sat
down
upon
the
step
with
a
nameless
dread
in
her
heart
tom
had
gone
to
millford
several
times
since
his
father
had
gone
to
winnipeg
and
he
had
stayed
longer
than
was
necessary
too
but
no
no
tom
would
not
spend
good
money
that
way
the
habit
of
years
was
on
her
it
was
the
money
she
thought
of
first
then
she
thought
of
pearl
going
to
the
foot
of
the
stairway
she
called
pearl
you
may
come
down
now
did
ye
find
it
pearl
asked
eagerly
no
do
ye
still
think
i
took
it
no
i
do
pearl
she
answered
all
right
then
i
come
right
down
pearl
said
gladly
chapter
xxiii
saved
that
night
arthur
condition
was
to
pearl
sharp
eyes
alarming
he
tried
to
quiet
her
fears
he
would
be
well
directly
it
was
nothing
nothing
at
all
a
mere
indisposition
pearl
did
know
what
that
was
but
when
she
went
into
the
granary
with
a
pitcher
of
water
for
him
and
found
him
writing
letters
in
the
feeble
light
of
a
lantern
she
took
one
look
at
him
laid
down
the
pitcher
and
hurried
out
to
tell
tom
tom
was
in
the
kitchen
taking
off
his
boots
preparatory
to
going
to
bed
tom
she
said
excitedly
get
back
into
yer
boots
and
go
for
the
doctor
arthur
got
the
thing
that
pa
had
and
it
have
to
be
cut
out
of
him
or
he
die
what
tom
gasped
with
one
foot
across
his
knee
i
think
he
has
it
pearl
said
he
actin
just
like
what
pa
did
and
he
in
awful
pain
i
know
only
he
wo
let
on
and
we
must
get
the
doctor
or
he
might
die
before
mornin
and
then
how
we
feel
tom
hesitated
remember
tom
he
has
a
father
and
a
mother
and
four
brothers
and
a
girl
called
thursa
and
an
uncle
that
is
a
bishop
and
how
we
ever
face
them
when
we
go
to
heaven
if
we
just
set
around
and
let
arthur
die
what
is
it
pearl
motherwell
said
coming
into
the
room
having
heard
pearl
excited
tones
it
arthur
come
out
and
see
him
you
see
he
needs
the
doctor
ginger
tea
and
mustard
plasters
ai
a
on
a
pain
like
what
he
has
let
give
him
a
dose
of
aconite
tom
said
with
conviction
fix
him
motherwell
and
pearl
went
over
to
the
granary
do
knock
at
the
door
pearl
whispered
to
her
as
they
went
ye
ca
tell
a
thing
about
him
if
ye
do
arthur
straighten
up
and
be
polite
at
his
own
funeral
just
look
in
the
crack
there
and
you
see
if
he
ai
sick
motherwell
did
see
arthur
lay
tossing
and
moaning
across
his
bed
his
letter
pad
and
pencil
beside
him
on
the
floor
motherwell
did
not
want
tom
to
go
to
millford
that
night
one
of
the
harvesters
excursions
was
expected
was
probably
in
then
there
would
be
a
wild
time
besides
the
bill
still
worried
her
if
tom
had
it
he
might
spend
it
no
tom
was
safer
at
home
oh
i
do
think
he
so
very
bad
she
said
we
get
the
doctor
in
the
morning
if
he
is
any
better
now
you
go
to
bed
pearl
and
do
worry
yourself
but
pearl
did
not
go
to
bed
when
motherwell
and
tom
had
gone
to
their
own
rooms
she
built
up
the
kitchen
fire
and
heated
a
full
of
salt
with
which
she
filled
a
pair
of
her
own
stockings
and
brought
them
to
arthur
she
remembered
that
her
mother
had
done
that
when
her
father
was
sick
and
that
it
had
eased
his
pain
she
drew
a
pail
of
fresh
water
from
the
well
and
brought
a
basinful
to
him
and
bathed
his
burning
face
and
hands
arthur
received
her
attentions
gratefully
pearl
knew
what
she
would
do
she
would
run
over
and
tell
jim
and
jim
would
go
for
the
doctor
jim
would
not
be
in
bed
yet
she
knew
and
even
if
he
were
he
would
not
mind
getting
up
jim
would
go
to
town
any
time
she
wanted
anything
one
time
when
she
had
said
she
just
wished
she
knew
whether
camilla
had
her
new
suit
made
yet
jim
jumped
right
up
and
said
he
go
and
see
motherwell
had
gone
to
her
room
very
much
concerned
with
her
own
troubles
why
should
tom
fall
into
evil
ways
she
asked
herself
a
boy
who
had
been
as
economically
brought
up
as
he
was
other
people
boys
had
gone
wrong
but
she
had
alway
thought
that
the
parents
were
to
blame
some
way
then
she
thought
of
arthur
perhaps
he
should
have
the
doctor
she
had
been
slow
to
believe
that
polly
was
really
sick
and
had
had
cause
for
regret
she
would
send
for
the
doctor
in
the
morning
but
what
was
pearl
doing
so
long
in
the
kitchen
she
could
hear
her
moving
around
pearl
must
go
to
her
bed
or
she
would
not
be
able
to
get
up
in
the
morning
pearl
was
just
going
out
of
the
kitchen
with
her
hat
and
coat
on
when
motherwell
came
in
where
are
you
going
pearl
she
asked
to
git
someone
to
go
for
the
doctor
pearl
answered
stoutly
is
he
worse
motherwell
asked
quickly
he
ca
git
worse
pearl
replied
grimly
if
he
gits
worse
he
be
dead
motherwell
called
tom
at
once
and
told
him
to
bring
the
doctor
as
soon
as
he
could
where
my
overcoat
mother
tom
called
from
the
hall
take
your
father
she
said
he
is
going
to
get
a
new
one
while
he
is
in
winnipeg
that
one
too
small
for
him
now
i
put
yours
outside
to
air
it
had
a
queer
smell
on
it
i
thought
and
now
hurry
tom
bring
barner
i
think
he
the
best
for
a
serious
case
clay
is
too
young
anyway
the
old
man
knowns
far
more
than
he
does
if
you
can
only
get
him
sober
pearl
heart
sank
arthur
as
good
as
dead
she
said
as
she
went
to
the
granary
crying
softly
to
herself
clay
is
the
only
man
who
could
save
him
and
they
wo
have
him
the
sun
had
gone
down
and
heavy
clouds
filled
the
sky
not
a
star
was
to
be
seen
and
the
night
was
growing
darker
and
darker
a
sound
of
wheels
came
from
across
the
creek
coming
rapidly
down
the
road
the
old
dog
barked
viciously
a
horse
driven
at
full
speed
dashed
through
the
yard
pearl
ran
shouting
after
for
even
in
the
gathering
darkness
she
recognised
the
one
person
in
all
the
world
who
could
save
arthur
but
the
wind
and
the
barking
of
the
dog
drowned
her
voice
and
the
sound
of
the
doctor
wheels
grew
fainter
in
the
distance
only
for
a
moment
was
pearl
dismayed
i
catch
him
coming
back
she
said
if
i
have
to
tie
binding
twine
across
the
road
to
tangle
up
pleurisy
long
legs
he
on
his
way
to
cowan
i
know
ab
cowan
has
quinsy
never
mind
thursa
we
get
him
i
hope
now
that
the
old
doctor
is
too
full
to
come
oh
no
i
either
i
just
hope
he
away
and
clay
will
have
it
done
before
he
gets
here
when
tom
arrived
in
millford
he
found
a
great
many
people
thronging
the
streets
one
of
the
ontario
harvesters
excursions
had
arrived
a
few
hours
before
and
the
huron
and
bruce
boys
were
already
making
themselves
seen
and
heard
tom
went
at
once
to
barner
office
and
found
that
the
doctor
was
out
making
calls
but
would
be
back
in
an
hour
not
at
all
displeased
at
having
some
time
to
spend
tom
went
back
to
the
gaily
lighted
front
street
the
crowds
of
men
who
went
in
and
out
of
the
hotels
seemed
to
promise
some
excitement
inside
of
the
grand
pacific
a
gramophone
querulously
sang
any
rags
any
bones
any
bottles
to
a
delighted
company
of
listeners
when
tom
entered
he
was
received
with
the
greatest
cordiality
by
the
bartender
and
others
here
is
life
and
tom
thought
to
himself
here
the
place
to
have
a
good
time
is
your
father
back
yet
tom
the
bartender
asked
as
he
served
a
line
of
customers
he
come
up
monday
night
i
expect
tom
answered
rather
proud
of
the
attention
he
was
receiving
the
bartender
pushed
a
box
of
cigars
toward
him
have
a
cigar
tom
he
said
no
thank
you
tom
answered
not
any
tom
could
not
smoke
but
he
drew
a
plug
of
chewing
tobacco
from
his
pocket
and
took
a
chew
to
show
that
his
sympathies
were
that
way
i
guess
perhaps
some
of
you
men
met
motherwell
in
winnipeg
in
there
hiring
men
for
this
locality
the
bartender
said
amiably
that
the
name
of
the
gent
that
hired
me
said
one
me
too
and
me
came
from
others
i
no
intention
of
comin
here
a
man
from
paisley
said
i
was
goin
to
souris
until
that
gent
got
a
holt
of
me
and
i
thought
if
he
wuz
a
sample
of
the
men
ye
raise
here
hike
this
way
he
lookin
for
a
treat
the
bartender
laughed
he
sized
you
up
tom
as
a
pretty
good
fellow
no
i
ai
after
no
treat
the
paisley
man
declared
straight
what
i
told
you
tom
unconsciously
put
his
hand
in
his
coat
pocket
and
felt
the
money
his
father
had
put
there
he
drew
it
out
wondering
the
quick
eyes
of
the
bartender
saw
it
at
once
tom
getting
out
his
wad
boys
he
laughed
nothin
mean
about
tom
you
bet
tom
goin
to
do
somethin
in
the
confusion
that
followed
tom
heard
himself
saying
all
right
boys
come
along
and
name
yer
drinks
tom
had
a
very
indistinct
memory
of
what
followed
he
remembered
having
a
handful
of
silver
and
of
trying
to
put
it
in
his
pocket
once
when
the
boys
were
standing
in
front
of
the
bar
at
his
invitation
he
noticed
a
miserable
hungry
looking
man
who
drank
greedily
it
was
skinner
then
someone
took
him
by
the
arm
and
said
something
about
his
having
enough
and
tom
felt
himself
being
led
across
a
floor
that
rose
and
fell
strangely
to
a
black
lounge
that
tried
to
slide
away
from
him
and
then
came
back
suddenly
and
hit
him
the
wind
raged
and
howled
with
increasing
violence
around
the
granary
where
arthur
lay
tossing
upon
his
hard
bed
it
seized
the
door
and
rattled
it
in
wanton
playfulness
as
if
to
deceive
the
sick
man
with
the
hope
that
a
friend
hand
was
on
the
latch
and
then
raced
blustering
and
screaming
down
to
the
meadows
below
the
fanning
mill
and
piles
of
grain
bags
made
fantastic
shadows
on
the
wall
in
the
lantern
dim
light
and
seemed
to
his
distorted
fancy
like
dark
and
terrible
spectres
waiting
to
spring
upon
him
pearl
knelt
down
beside
him
tenderly
bathing
his
burning
face
why
do
you
do
all
this
for
me
pearl
he
asked
slowly
his
voice
coming
thick
and
painfully
she
changed
the
cloth
on
his
head
before
replying
oh
i
keep
thinkin
it
might
be
teddy
or
jimmy
or
maybe
wee
danny
she
replied
gently
and
besides
there
thursa
the
young
man
opened
his
eyes
and
smiled
bravely
yes
there
thursa
he
said
simply
pearl
kept
the
fire
burning
in
the
kitchen
the
doctor
might
need
hot
water
she
remembered
that
he
had
needed
sheets
too
and
carbolic
acid
when
he
had
operated
on
her
father
the
winter
before
arthur
did
not
speak
much
as
the
night
wore
on
and
pearl
began
to
grow
drowsy
in
spite
of
all
her
efforts
she
brought
the
old
dog
into
the
granary
with
her
for
company
the
wind
rattled
the
mud
chinking
in
the
walls
and
drove
showers
of
dust
and
gravel
against
the
little
window
she
had
put
the
lantern
behind
the
fanning
mill
so
that
its
light
would
not
shine
in
arthur
eyes
and
in
the
she
and
old
nap
waited
and
listened
the
dog
soon
laid
his
head
upon
her
knee
and
slept
and
pearl
was
left
alone
to
watch
surely
the
doctor
would
come
soon
it
was
a
good
thing
she
had
the
dog
he
was
so
warm
beside
her
and
she
sprang
up
guiltily
had
she
been
asleep
what
if
he
had
passed
while
she
slept
she
grew
cold
at
the
thought
did
he
pass
nap
she
whispered
to
the
dog
almost
crying
oh
nap
did
we
let
him
go
past
nap
yawned
widely
and
flicked
one
ear
which
was
his
way
of
telling
pearl
not
to
distress
herself
nobody
had
passed
pearl
eyes
were
heavy
with
sleep
this
is
not
the
time
to
sleep
she
said
yawning
and
shivering
arthur
stood
on
the
floor
beside
the
bed
where
she
had
been
bathing
his
face
she
put
more
water
into
it
now
then
she
said
once
for
his
mother
once
for
his
father
a
big
long
one
for
thursa
holding
her
head
so
long
below
the
water
that
it
felt
numb
when
she
took
it
out
i
ca
do
one
for
each
of
the
boys
she
shivered
i
lump
the
boys
here
a
big
one
for
them
there
now
her
teeth
chattered
as
she
wiped
her
hair
on
towel
that
ought
to
help
some
arthur
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
anxiously
around
him
pearl
was
beside
him
at
once
pearl
he
said
what
is
wrong
with
me
what
terrible
pain
is
this
that
has
me
in
its
clutches
the
strength
had
gone
out
of
the
man
he
could
no
longer
battle
with
it
pearl
hesitated
it
is
not
well
to
tell
sick
people
your
gravest
fears
still
arthur
is
english
and
the
english
are
gritty
pearl
thought
to
herself
arthur
she
said
i
think
you
have
appendicitis
arthur
lay
motionless
for
a
few
moments
he
knew
what
that
was
but
that
requires
an
operation
he
said
at
length
a
very
skilful
one
it
does
pearl
replied
and
that
what
you
get
as
soon
as
clay
gets
here
i
thinking
arthur
turned
his
face
into
his
pillow
an
operation
for
appendicitis
here
in
this
place
and
by
that
young
man
no
older
than
himself
perhaps
he
knew
that
at
home
it
was
only
undertaken
by
the
oldest
and
best
surgeons
in
the
hospitals
pearl
saw
something
of
his
fears
in
his
face
so
she
hastened
to
reassure
him
she
said
cheerfully
do
ye
be
worried
arthur
about
it
at
all
at
all
man
alive
clay
thinks
no
more
of
an
operation
like
that
than
i
would
o
your
nails
a
strange
feeling
began
at
arthur
heart
and
spread
up
to
his
brain
it
had
come
it
was
here
from
lightning
and
tempest
from
plague
pestilence
and
famine
from
battle
and
murder
and
sudden
death
good
lord
deliver
us
he
had
prayed
it
many
times
meaninglessly
but
he
clung
to
it
now
clung
to
it
desperately
as
a
drowning
man
he
put
his
hand
over
his
eyes
his
pain
was
forgotten
other
lights
are
paling
which
for
long
years
we
have
rejoiced
to
see
we
would
not
mourn
them
for
we
go
to
thee
yes
it
was
all
right
he
was
ready
now
he
had
come
of
a
race
of
men
who
feared
not
death
in
whatever
form
it
came
bring
us
to
our
resting
beds
at
night
weary
and
content
and
undishonoured
and
grant
us
in
the
end
the
gift
of
sleep
he
repeated
the
prayer
to
himself
slowly
that
was
it
weary
and
content
and
undishonoured
pearl
he
said
reaching
out
his
burning
hand
until
it
rested
on
hers
all
my
letters
are
there
in
that
black
portmanteau
and
the
key
is
in
my
i
have
a
fancy
that
i
would
like
no
eye
but
yours
to
see
them
until
i
am
quite
well
again
she
nodded
and
if
you
should
have
need
to
write
to
thursa
tell
her
i
had
loving
hands
around
me
at
the
last
pearl
gently
stroked
his
hand
and
to
my
father
write
that
i
knew
no
fear
his
voice
grew
steadier
and
passed
out
of
life
glad
to
have
been
a
brave
man
son
and
borne
even
for
a
few
years
a
godly
father
name
i
will
write
it
arthur
she
said
and
to
my
mother
pearl
his
voice
wavered
and
broke
my
mother
for
i
was
her
youngest
child
tell
her
she
was
my
last
and
tenderest
thought
pearl
pressed
his
hand
tenderly
against
her
little
cheek
for
it
was
danny
now
grown
a
man
but
danny
still
who
lay
before
her
fighting
for
his
life
and
at
the
thought
her
tears
fell
fast
pearl
he
spoke
again
after
a
pause
pressing
his
hand
to
his
forehead
while
my
mind
holds
clear
perhaps
you
would
be
good
enough
you
have
been
so
good
to
me
to
say
that
prayer
you
learned
my
father
will
be
in
his
study
now
and
soon
it
will
be
time
for
morning
prayers
i
often
feel
his
blessing
on
me
pearl
i
want
to
feel
it
now
bringing
peace
and
rest
weary
and
content
and
undishonoured
and
undishonoured
and
grant
us
his
voice
grew
fainter
and
trailed
away
into
incoherency
and
now
oh
thou
dignified
rector
of
agnes
in
thy
home
beyond
the
sea
lay
aside
the
appendix
to
the
apology
of
perpetua
over
which
thou
porest
for
under
all
thy
dignity
and
formalism
there
beats
a
loving
father
heart
the
shadows
are
gathering
dear
sir
around
thy
fifth
son
in
a
far
country
and
in
the
gathering
shadows
there
stalks
noiselessly
relentlessly
that
grim
gray
spectre
death
on
thy
knees
then
oh
rector
of
agnes
and
blend
thy
prayers
with
the
feeble
petitions
of
her
who
even
now
for
thy
house
entreats
the
throne
of
grace
pray
oh
thou
on
whom
the
bishop
hands
have
been
laid
that
the
golden
bowl
be
not
broken
nor
the
silver
cord
loosed
for
the
breath
of
thy
fifth
son
draws
heavily
and
the
things
of
time
and
sense
are
fading
fading
fading
from
his
closing
eyes
pearl
repeated
the
prayer
and
grant
oh
most
merciful
father
for
his
sake
that
we
may
hereafter
lead
a
godly
righteous
and
a
sober
life
she
stopped
abruptly
the
old
dog
lifted
his
head
and
listened
snatching
up
the
lantern
she
was
out
of
the
door
before
the
dog
was
on
his
feet
there
were
wheels
coming
coming
down
the
road
in
mad
haste
pearl
swung
the
lantern
and
shouted
the
doctor
reined
in
his
horse
she
flashed
the
lantern
into
his
face
oh
doc
she
cried
dear
doc
i
have
been
waitin
and
waitin
for

granary
arthur
the
sickest
thing
ye
ever
saw
git
in
there
on
the
double
jump
she
put
the
lantern
into
his
hand
as
she
spoke
hastily
unhitching
the
doctor
horse
she
felt
her
way
with
him
into
the
driving
shed
the
night
was
at
its
blackest
now
thursa
she
laughed
to
herself
we
got
him
and
he
do
it
dear
doc
he
do
it
the
wind
blew
dust
and
gravel
in
her
face
as
she
ran
across
the
yard
when
she
went
into
the
granary
the
doctor
was
sitting
on
the
box
by
arthur
bed
with
his
face
in
his
hands
oh
doc
what
is
it
she
cried
seizing
his
arm
the
doctor
looked
at
her
dazed
and
even
pearl
uttered
a
cry
of
dismay
when
she
saw
his
face
for
it
was
like
the
face
of
a
dead
man
pearl
he
said
slowly
i
have
made
a
terrible
mistake
i
have
killed
young
cowan
bet
he
deserved
it
then
pearl
said
stoutly
killed

doctor
went
on
not
heeding
her
he
died
in
my
hands
poor
fellow
oh

poor
young

lanced
his
throat
thinking

pearl
cried
excitedly
waving
her
arms
he
ai
the

o
doctors

and
there
ye
are
i
bet

worse
about

than

does
doc
the
doctor
groaned
come
doc
she
said
plucking
his
sleeve
take
a
look
at
arthur
the
doctor
rose
uncertainly
and
paced
up
and
down
the
floor
with
his
face
in
his
hands
swaying
like
a
drunken
man
o
god
he
moaned
if
i
could
but
bring
back
his
life
with
mine
but
i
ca
i

but
said
not

at

she
said

a
look
at
him
and
see
if

supreme
effort

doctor
gained
control
of
himself
and
made
a
hasty
but
thorough
examination

has
he
said
a
well
developed
case
of
it
pearl
handed
him
his
satchel
here
then
she
said

he
cried
i

repeated
hopelessly

knife
i
ca

men
in
one
night
o
god
be
merciful
to
a
poor
blundering
miserable
wretch
he
groaned
burying
his
face
in
his
hands
and
pearl
noticed
that
the
back
of
his
coat
quivered
like
human
flesh
arthur
breath
was
becoming
more
and
more
laboured
his
eyes
roved
sightlessly
around
the
room
his
head
rolled
on
the
pillow
in
a
vain
search
for
rest
his
fingers
clutched
convulsively
at
the
pearl
was
filled
with
dismay
the
foundations
of
her
little
world
were
tottering
all
but
one
there
was
one
who
had
never
failed
her
he
would
not
fail
her
now
she
dropped
on
her
knees
o
god
dear
god
she
prayed
beating
her
hard
little
brown
hands
together
do
go
back
on
us
dear
god
put
the
gimp
into
doc
again
he
not
scared
to
do
it

he
just
lost
his
grip
for
a
minute

not
scared

looks
like

but
he
is

bank
on

just
a
minute

a
minute

and
he

it
right
amen
when
pearl
rose
from
her
knees
the
doctor
had
lifted
his
head
do
you
want
hot
water
and
sheets
and
carbolic
she
asked
he
nodded
when
she
came
back
with
them
the
doctor
was
taking
off
his
coat
his
instruments
were
laid
out
on
the
box
get
a
lamp
he
said
to
pearl
pearl
happy
heart
was
singing
with
joy
o
lord
dear
lord
you
never
fail
she
murmured
as
she
ran
across
to
the
kitchen
when
she
came
back
with
the
lamp
and
a
chair
to
set
it
on
the
doctor
was
pinning
a
sheet
above
the
bed
his
face
was
white
and
drawn
but
his
hand
was
firm
and
his
mouth
was
a
straight
line
arthur
was
tossing
his
arms
convulsively
the
doctor
listened
with
his
ear
a
minute
upon
the
sick
man
heart
then
the
gauze
mask
was
laid
upon
his
face
and
the
chloroform
soon
did
its
merciful
work
the
doctor
handed
pearl
the
bottle
a
drop
or
two
if
he
moves
he
said
then
horace
clay
the
man
with
a
man
mistakes
his
fears
his
was
gone
and
in
his
place
stood
horace
clay
the
doctor
keen
alert
masterful
indomitable
with
the
look
of
battle
on
his
face
he
worked
rapidly
never
faltering
his
eyes
burning
with
the
joy
of
the
true
physician
who
fights
to
save
to
save
a
human
life
from
the
grim
old
enemy
death
you
have
saved
his
life
pearl
the
doctor
said
two
hours
later
arthur
lay
sleeping
easily
the
flush
gone
from
his
face
and
his
breath
coming
regularly
the
doctor
put
his
hand
gently
on
her
tumbled
little
brown
head
you
saved
him
from
death
pearl
and
me
from
something
worse
and
then
pearl
took
the
doctor
hand
in
both
of
hers
and
kissed
it
reverently
that
for
thursa
she
said
gravely
tom
was
awakened
by
some
one
shaking
him
gently
tom
tom
motherwell
what
are
you
doing
here
a
woman
knelt
beside
him
her
eyes
were
sweet
and
kind
and
sad
beyond
expression
tom
how
did
you
come
here
she
asked
gently
as
tom
struggled
to
rise
he
sat
up
staring
stupidly
around
him
wha
a
matter
this
he
asked
thickly
you
in
the
at
the
hotel
she
said
he
would
have
lain
down
again
but
she
took
him
firmly
by
the
arm
come
tom
she
said
come
and
have
a
drink
of
water
she
led
him
out
of
the
hotel
to
the
pump
at
the
corner
of
the
street
tom
drank
thirstily
she
pumped
water
on
his
hands
and
bathed
his
burning
face
in
it
the
cold
water
and
the
fresh
air
began
to
clear
his
brain
what
time
is
it
he
asked
her
nearly
morning
she
said
about
three
i
think
and
tom
knew
even
in
the
darkness
that
she
had
lost
more
teeth
it
was
skinner
tom
she
said
did
you
see
skinner
in
there
i
came
down
to
get
him
i
want
him
the
child
is
dead
an
hour
ago
she
spoke
hurriedly
tom
remembered
now
yes
he
had
seen
skinner
but
not
lately
it
was
a
long
long
time
ago
now
tom
go
home
she
said
kindly
this
is
bad
work
for
you
my
dear
boy
stop
it
now
dear
tom
while
you
can
it
will
kill
you
body
and
soul
a
thought
struggled
in
tom
dull
brain
there
was
something
he
wanted
to
say
to
her
which
must
be
said
but
she
was
gone
he
drank
again
from
the
cup
that
hung
beside
the
pump
where
did
he
get
this
burning
thirst
and
his
head
how
it
pounded
she
had
told
him
to
go
home
well
why
was
he
at
home
what
was
he
doing
here
slowly
his
memory
came
back
he
had
come
for
the
doctor
and
the
doctor
was
to
be
back
in
an
hour
and
now
it
was
nearly
morning
did
she
say
he
tried
to
run
but
his
knees
failed
him
what
about
arthur
he
grew
chill
at
the
thought
he
might
be
dead
by
this
time
he
reached
the
doctor
office
some
way
his
head
still
throbbed
and
his
feet
were
heavy
as
lead
but
his
mind
was
clear
a
lamp
was
burning
in
the
office
but
no
one
was
in
it
seemed
a
month
ago
since
he
had
been
there
before
the
air
of
the
office
was
close
and
stifling
and
heavy
with
stale
tobacco
smoke
tom
sat
down
wearily
in
the
doctor
armchair
his
heart
beat
painfully
he
be
dead
be
dead
he
be
dead
it
was
pounding
the
clock
on
the
table
was
saying
it
too
tom
got
up
and
walked
up
and
down
to
drown
the
sound
he
stopped
before
a
cabinet
and
gazed
horrified
at
a
human
skeleton
that
grinned
evilly
at
him
he
opened
the
door
hastily
the
night
wind
fanned
his
face
he
sat
down
upon
the
step
thoroughly
sober
now
but
sick
in
body
and
soul
soon
a
heavy
step
sounded
on
the
sidewalk
and
the
old
doctor
came
into
the
patch
of
light
that
shone
from
the
door
do
you
want
me
he
asked
as
tom
stood
up
yes
tom
answered
at
once
what
wrong
the
doctor
asked
brusquely
tom
told
him
as
well
as
he
could
were
you
here
before
early
in
the
evening
tom
nodded
hurry
up
then
and
get
your
horse
the
doctor
said
going
past
him
into
the
office
yes
i
thought
so
the
doctor
said
gathering
up
his
instruments
i
ought
to
know
the
signs
well
well
the
poor
young
englishman
has
had
plenty
of
time
to
die
from
ten
in
the
evening
till
four
the
next
morning
without
indecent
haste
either
while
this
young
fellow
was
hitting
up
the
firewater
still
god
knows
i
should
be
hard
on
him
i
often
kept
people
waiting
for
the
same
reason
and
he
added
grimly
they
did
always
wait
either
when
tom
and
the
old
doctor
drove
into
the
yard
everything
was
silent
the
wind
had
fallen
and
the
eastern
sky
was
bright
with
morning
the
old
dog
who
lay
in
front
of
the
granary
door
raised
his
head
at
their
approach
and
lifted
one
ear
as
if
to
command
silence
tom
helped
the
doctor
out
of
the
buggy
he
tried
to
unhitch
the
horse
but
the
beating
of
his
heart
nearly
choked
him
the
fear
of
what
might
be
in
the
granary
he
waited
for
the
exclamation
from
the
doctor
which
would
proclaim
him
a
murderer
he
heard
the
door
open
again
the
doctor
was
coming
to
tell
him
tom
knees
grew
weak
he
held
to
the
horse
for
support
who
was
this
who
had
caught
his
arm
it
was
pearl
crying
and
laughing
tom
tom
it
all
over
and
arthur
going
to
get
well
she
whispered
clay
came
but
pearl
was
not
prepared
for
what
happened
tom
put
his
head
down
upon
the
horse
neck
and
cried
like
a
child
no
like
a
man
for
in
the
dark
and
terrible
night
that
had
just
passed
sullied
though
it
was
by
temptations
and
yieldings
and
neglect
of
duty
the
soul
of
a
man
had
been
born
in
him
and
he
had
put
away
childish
things
forever
clay
was
kneeling
in
front
of
the
box
cleaning
his
instruments
with
his
back
toward
the
door
when
barner
entered
he
greeted
the
older
man
cordially
receiving
but
a
curt
reply
then
the
professional
eye
of
the
old
doctor
began
to
take
in
the
situation
a
roll
of
antiseptic
lint
lay
on
the
floor
the
fumes
of
the
disinfectants
and
of
the
ansthetic
still
hung
on
the
air
tom
description
of
the
case
had
suggested
appendicitis
what
was
the
trouble
he
asked
quickly
the
young
doctor
told
him
giving
him
such
a
thoroughly
scientific
history
of
the
case
that
the
old
doctor
opinion
of
him
underwent
a
radical
change
the
young
doctor
explained
briefly
what
he
had
attempted
to
do
by
the
operation
the
regular
breathing
and
apparently
normal
temperature
of
the
patient
was
to
the
old
doctor
sufficient
proof
of
its
success
he
stooped
suddenly
to
examine
the
dressing
that
the
young
doctor
was
showing
him
but
his
face
twitched
with
some
strong
emotion
pride
professional
jealousy
hatred
were
breaking
down
before
a
stronger
and
a
worthier
feeling
he
turned
abruptly
and
grasped
the
young
doctor
hand
clay
he
cried
it
was
a
great
piece
of
work
here
alone
and
by
lamplight
you
are
a
brave
man
and
i
honour
you
then
his
voice
broke
i
give
every
day
of
my
miserable
life
to
be
able
to
do
this
once
more
just
once
but
i
have
the
nerve
clay
the
hand
that
the
young
doctor
held
trembled
i
have
the
nerve
i
been
going
on
a
whiskey
nerve
too
long
barner
the
young
man
replied
as
he
returned
the
other
grasp
i
thank
you
for
your
good
words
but
i
was
alone
when
i
did
it
the
bravest
little
girl
in
all
the
world
was
here
and
shamed
me
out
of
my
weakness
and
he
added
reverently
i
think
god
himself
steadied
my
hand
the
old
man
looked
up
wondering
i
believe
you
clay
he
said
simply
chapter
xxiv
the
harvest
tom
went
straight
to
his
mother
that
morning
and
told
her
everything
the
party
he
had
gone
to
his
discontent
his
desire
for
company
and
fun
and
excitement
taking
the
money
and
the
events
of
the
previous
night
motherwell
saw
her
boy
in
a
new
light
as
she
listened
and
tom
had
a
glorified
vision
of
his
mother
as
she
clasped
him
in
her
arms
crying
it
is
our
fault
tom
mine
and
your
father
we
have
tried
to
make
you
into
a
machine
like
we
are
ourselves
and
forgot
that
you
had
a
soul
but
it
not
too
late
yet
tom
i
hate
the
money
too
if
it
only
to
be
hoarded
up
the
money
we
sent
to
polly
mother
has
given
me
more
pleasure
than
all
the
rest
that
we
have
mother
tom
said
how
do
you
suppose
that
money
happened
to
be
in
that
overcoat
pocket
i
do
know
she
answered
your
father
must
have
left
it
there
when
he
wore
it
last
it
looks
as
if
the
devil
himself
put
it
there
to
tempt
you
tom
when
his
father
came
back
from
winnipeg
tom
made
to
him
a
full
confession
as
he
had
to
his
mother
and
was
surprised
to
find
that
his
father
had
for
him
not
one
word
of
reproach
since
sending
the
money
to
polly
mother
sam
had
found
a
little
of
the
blessedness
of
giving
and
it
had
changed
his
way
of
looking
at
things
in
some
measure
at
least
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
give
the
money
back
to
the
church
and
now
when
he
found
that
it
had
gone
and
gone
in
such
a
way
he
felt
vaguely
that
it
was
a
punishment
for
his
own
meanness
and
in
a
small
measure
at
least
he
was
grateful
that
no
worse
evil
had
resulted
from
it
father
did
you
put
that
money
there
tom
asked
yes
i
did
tom
he
answered
i
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
myself
for
being
so
careless
too
it
just
seemed
as
if
it
was
the
devil
himself
tom
said
i
had
no
intention
of
drinking
when
i
took
out
that
money
well
tom
his
father
said
with
a
short
laugh
i
guess
the
devil
had
a
hand
in
it
he
was
in
me
quite
a
bit
when
i
put
it
there
i
kin
tell
ye
the
next
sunday
morning
samuel
motherwell
his
wife
and
son
went
to
church
sam
placed
on
the
plate
an
envelope
containing
fifty
dollars
on
the
following
morning
sam
had
just
cut
two
rounds
with
the
binder
when
the
reverend
hugh
grantley
drove
into
the
field
sam
stopped
his
binder
and
got
down
well
motherwell
the
minister
said
holding
out
his
hand
cordially
as
he
walked
over
to
where
sam
stood
how
did
it
happen
sam
grasped
his
hand
warmly
ask
tom
he
said
nodding
his
head
toward
his
son
who
was
stooking
the
grain
a
little
distance
away
it
is
tom
story
grantley
did
ask
tom
and
tom
told
him
and
there
in
the
sunshine
with
the
smell
of
the
ripe
grain
in
their
nostrils
as
the
minister
helped
him
to
carry
the
sheaves
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
were
opened
to
tom
and
a
new
life
was
born
within
him
a
life
of
godliness
and
of
brotherly
kindness
whose
blessed
influence
has
gone
far
beyond
the
narrow
limits
of
that
neighbourhood
it
was
nearly
noon
when
the
minister
left
him
and
drove
home
through
the
grain
fields
with
a
glorified
look
on
his
face
as
one
who
had
seen
the
heavens
opened
just
before
he
turned
into
the
valley
of
the
souris
he
stopped
his
horse
and
looked
back
over
the
miles
and
miles
of
rippling
gold
the
of
many
binders
came
to
his
ears
oh
what
a
day
it
was
all
sunshine
and
blue
sky
below
him
the
river
glinted
through
the
trees
and
the
railway
track
shimmered
like
a
silver
ribbon
and
as
he
drove
into
the
winding
valley
the
reverend
hugh
grantley
sang
despite
his
cameronian
blood
sang
like
a
methodist
praise
god
from
whom
all
blessings
flow
praise
him
all
creatures
here
below
praise
him
above
ye
heavenly
host

chapter
xxv
cupid
emissary
mcguire
did
not
look
like
cupid
earthly
representative
as
she
sat
in
her
and
bitterly
complained
of
the
weather
the
weather
was
damp
and
cloudy
and
mcguire
said
her
jints
were
jumpin
the
little
watsons
were
behaving
so
well
that
even
with
her
rheumatism
to
help
her
vision
she
could
find
no
fault
with
them
just
now
but
she
reckoned
the
mischief
was
hatchin
a
change
was
taking
place
in
mcguire
although
she
was
unconscious
of
it
mary
barner
who
was
a
frequent
and
welcome
visitor
was
having
an
influence
even
on
the
flinty
heart
of
the
relict
of
the
late
mcguire
mary
red
up
her
house
for
her
when
her
rheumatism
was
bad
she
cooked
for
her
she
sang
and
read
for
her
above
all
things
mary
was
her
friend
and
no
one
who
has
a
friend
can
be
altogether
at
war
with
the
world
one
evening
when
mary
was
reading
the
pilgrim
progress
to
her
the
reverend
hugh
grantley
came
in
and
begged
to
be
let
stay
and
enjoy
the
reading
too
he
said
miss
barner
voice
seemed
to
take
the
tangles
out
of
his
brain
whereupon
mcguire
winked
at
herself
that
night
she
obligingly
fell
asleep
just
where
christian
resolved
to
press
on
to
the
heavenly
city
at
all
costs
and
mistrust
and
timorous
ran
down
the
hill
after
that
the
minister
came
regularly
and
mcguire
though
she
complained
to
herself
that
it
was
hard
to
lose
so
much
of
the
reading
fell
asleep
each
night
and
snored
loudly
she
said
she
had
been
young
herself
once
and
guessed
she
knew
how
it
was
with
young
folks
just
hoped
he
was
good
enough
for
mary
that
was
all
men
were
such
deceivers
they
were
all
smooth
as
silk
until
it
came
to
livin
with
and
then
she
shook
her
head
grimly
thinking
no
doubt
of
the
vagaries
of
the
late
mcguire
the
reverend
hugh
grantley
walked
up
and
down
the
floor
of
his
study
in
deep
meditation
but
his
thoughts
were
not
on
his
sunday
sermon
nor
yet
on
the
topic
for
the
young
people
meeting
though
they
were
serious
enough
by
the
set
of
his
jaw
his
friend
clay
had
just
left
him
clay
was
in
a
radiant
humour
barner
friendly
attitude
toward
him
had
apparently
changed
the
aspect
of
affairs
and
now
the
old
doctor
had
suggested
taking
him
into
partnership
think
of
it
grantley
the
young
man
had
exclaimed
what
this
will
mean
to
me
he
is
a
great
man
in
his
profession
so
clever
so
witty
so
scholarly
everything
he
was
the
double
gold
medallist
in
his
year
at
mcgill
and
he
has
been
keeping
absolutely
sober
lately
thanks
to
your
good
offices
at
which
the
other
made
a
gesture
of
dissent
and
then
i
would
be
in
a
better
position
to
look
after
things
as
it
has
been
any
help
i
gave
mary
in
keeping
the
old
man
from
killing
people
had
to
be
done
on
the
sly
the
minister
winced
and
went
a
shade
paler
at
the
mention
of
her
name
but
the
doctor
did
not
notice
mary
is
anxious
to
have
it
brought
about
too
he
went
on
for
it
has
always
been
a
worry
to
her
when
he
was
away
but
now
he
will
do
the
office
work
and
i
will
do
the
driving
it
will
be
a
distinct
advantage
to
me
though
of
course
i
would
do
it
anyway
for
her
sake
then
it
was
well
for
the
minister
that
he
came
of
a
race
that
can
hold
its
features
in
control
this
easy
naming
of
her
name
the
apparent
proprietorship
the
radiant
happiness
in
clay
face
could
mean
but
one
thing
he
had
been
blind
blind
blind
he
heard
himself
saying
mechanically
yes
of
course
i
think
it
is
the
only
thing
to
do
and
clay
had
gone
out
whistling
he
sat
for
a
few
minutes
perfectly
motionless
then
a
shudder
ran
through
him
and
the
black
highland
blood
surged
into
his
face
and
anger
flamed
in
his
eyes
he
sprang
to
his
feet
with
his
huge
hands
clenched
he
shall
not
have
her
he
whispered
to
himself
she
is
mine
how
dare
he
name
her
only
for
a
moment
did
he
give
himself
to
the
ecstasy
of
rage
then
his
arms
fell
and
he
stood
straight
and
calm
and
strong
master
of
himself
once
more
what
right
have
i
he
groaned
wearily
pressing
his
hands
to
his
head
who
am
i
that
any
woman
should
desire
me
clay
with
his
easy
grace
his
wit
his
manliness
his
handsome
face
no
wonder
that
she
prefers
him
any
woman
would
and
clay
is
worthy
more
worthy
he
thought
in
an
agony
of
renunciation
he
thought
of
clay
life
as
he
had
known
it
now
for
years
so
fair
and
open
and
clean
yes
clay
is
worthy
of
her
he
repeated
it
dully
to
himself
as
he
walked
up
and
down
every
incident
of
the
past
three
months
came
back
to
him
now
with
cruel
distinctness
the
sweetness
of
her
voice
the
glorious
beauty
of
her
face
so
full
sometimes
of
life
pain
so
strong
too
in
the
overcoming
of
it
and
her
little
hands
oh
what
pretty
little
hands
they
were
he
had
held
them
once
only
for
a
moment
but
she
must
have
felt
the
love
that
throbbed
in
his
touch
and
he
had
thought
that
perhaps
perhaps
oh
unutterable
blind
fool
that
he
was
he
pressed
his
hands
again
to
his
head
and
groaned
aloud
and
he
who
hears
the
cry
of
the
child
or
of
the
strong
man
in
agony
drew
near
and
laid
his
pierced
hands
upon
him
in
healing
and
benediction
the
next
sunday
the
reverend
hugh
grantley
was
at
his
best
and
his
sermons
had
a
new
quality
that
appealed
to
and
comforted
many
a
weary
one
who
like
himself
was
traveling
by
the
in
mcguire
little
house
there
was
nothing
to
disturb
the
reading
now
for
the
minister
came
no
more
but
the
joyousness
had
all
gone
from
mary
voice
and
mcguire
found
herself
losing
all
interest
in
christian
struggles
as
she
looked
at
mary
face
once
she
saw
the
minister
pass
and
she
beat
upon
the
window
with
her
knitting
needle
but
he
hurried
by
without
looking
up
then
the
anger
of
mcguire
was
kindled
mightily
and
she
sometimes
woke
up
in
the
night
to
express
her
opinion
of
him
in
the
most
lurid
terms
she
could
think
of
feeling
meanwhile
the
futility
of
human
speech
it
was
a
hard
position
for
mcguire
who
had
always
been
able
to
settle
her
own
affairs
with
ease
and
grace
one
day
when
this
had
been
going
on
about
a
month
mcguire
sat
in
her
and
thought
hard
for
something
had
to
be
done
she
narrowed
her
black
eyes
into
slits
and
thought
and
thought
suddenly
she
started
as
if
she
heard
something
and
perhaps
she
did
the
angel
who
brought
the
inspiration
may
have
whirred
his
wings
a
little
mary
barner
was
coming
that
afternoon
to
red
up
a
little
for
her
for
her
rheumatism
had
been
very
bad
with
wonderful
agility
she
rose
and
made
ready
for
bed
first
however
she
carefully
examined
the
latch
on
her
kitchen
door
now
this
latch
had
a
bad
habit
of
locking
itself
if
the
door
was
closed
quickly
mcguire
tried
it
and
found
it
would
do
this
every
time
and
with
this
she
seemed
quite
satisfied
about
half
after
three
mary
came
and
began
to
set
the
little
house
in
order
when
this
was
done
mcguire
asked
her
if
she
would
make
her
a
few
buttermilk
biscuits
she
had
been
wishing
for
them
all
day
when
she
saw
mary
safely
in
the
kitchen
her
heart
began
to
beat
now
if
the
minister
was
at
home
the
thing
was
as
good
as
done
she
watched
at
the
window
until
jimmy
watson
came
from
school
and
then
tapping
on
the
glass
beckoned
him
to
come
in
which
he
did
with
great
trepidation
of
spirit
she
told
him
to
go
at
once
and
tell
grantley
to
come
for
she
needed
him
very
badly
then
she
got
back
into
bed
and
tried
to
compose
her
features
into
some
resemblance
of
invalidism
when
grantley
came
she
was
resting
easier
she
said
which
was
true
but
would
he
just
get
her
a
drink
of
water
from
the
kitchen
and
would
he
please
shut
the
door
quick
after
him
and
not
let
the
cat
up
grantley
went
at
once
and
she
heard
the
door
shut
with
a
snap
just
to
be
sure
that
it
was
snibbed
mcguire
tiptoed
after
him
in
her
bare
feet
a
very
bad
thing
for
a
lady
to
do
too
but
to
her
credit
be
it
written
she
did
not
listen
at
the
keyhole
she
got
back
into
bed
exclaiming
to
herself
with
great
emphasis
there
now
fight
it
out
among
yerselves
when
the
minister
stepped
quickly
inside
the
little
kitchen
closing
the
door
hurriedly
behind
him
to
prevent
the
invasion
of
the
cat
of
which
there
was
one
and
never
had
been
any
he
beheld
a
very
busy
and
beautiful
young
woman
sifting
flour
into
a
mary
he
almost
shouted
hardly
believing
his
senses
he
recovered
himself
instantly
and
explained
his
errand
but
the
pallor
of
his
face
was
unmistakable
when
mary
handed
him
the
cup
of
water
she
saw
that
his
hand
was
shaking
but
she
returned
to
her
baking
with
the
greatest
composure
the
minister
attempted
to
lift
the
latch
he
rattled
the
door
in
vain
come
out
this
way
mary
said
as
sweetly
as
if
she
really
wanted
him
to
go
she
tried
to
open
the
outside
door
also
in
vain
mcguire
had
secured
it
from
the
outside
with
a
prop
and
a
horse
nail
the
minister
came
and
tried
it
but
mcguire
work
held
good
then
the
absurdity
of
the
position
struck
them
both
and
the
little
house
rang
with
their
laughter
laughter
that
washed
away
the
heartaches
of
the
dreary
days
before
the
minister
reserve
was
breaking
down
mary
he
said
taking
her
face
between
his
hands
are
you
going
to
marry
horace
clay
no
she
answered
meeting
his
eyes
with
the
sweetest
light
in
hers
that
ever
comes
into
a
woman
face
well
then
he
said
as
he
drew
her
to
him
you
are
going
to
marry
me
the
day
had
been
dark
and
rainy
but
now
the
clouds
rolled
back
and
the
sunshine
warm
and
glorious
streamed
into
the
kitchen
the
teakettle
too
on
the
stove
behind
them
threw
up
its
lid
and
burst
into
a
thunder
of
bubbles
the
next
time
they
tried
the
door
it
yielded
mcguire
having
made
a
second
barefoot
journey
when
they
came
up
from
the
little
kitchen
the
light
ineffable
was
shining
in
their
faces
but
mcguire
called
them
back
to
earth
by
remarking
dryly
it
just
as
well
i
was
parchin
for
that
drink
chapter
xxvi
the
thanksgiving
the
prairie
lay
sere
and
brown
like
a
piece
of
faded
tapestry
beneath
the
november
sun
that
peering
through
the
air
seemed
old
and
worn
with
his
efforts
to
warm
the
poor
old
faded
earth
the
grain
had
all
been
cut
and
gathered
into
stacks
that
had
dotted
the
fields
two
by
two
like
comfortable
married
couples
and
these
in
turn
had
changed
into
billowy
piles
of
yellow
straw
through
which
herds
of
cattle
foraged
giving
a
touch
of
life
and
colour
to
the
unending
colourless
landscape
the
trees
stood
naked
and
bare
the
gardens
where
once
the
corn
waved
and
the
hollyhocks
flaunted
their
brazen
beauty
now
lay
a
tangled
litter
of
stalks
waiting
the
thrifty
farmer
torch
to
clear
them
away
before
the
snow
came
the
earth
had
yielded
of
her
fruits
and
now
rested
from
her
labour
worn
and
spent
taking
no
thought
of
comeliness
but
waiting
in
decrepit
indifference
for
her
friend
the
north
wind
to
bring
down
the
swirling
snow
to
hide
her
scars
and
heal
her
unloveliness
with
its
kindly
white
mantle
but
although
the
earth
lay
sere
and
brown
and
the
granaries
and
elevators
were
bursting
with
a
rich
abundance
innumerable
loaded
with
wheat
wound
heavily
up
the
long
grade
carrying
off
all
too
slowly
the
produce
of
the
plain
and
still
the
loads
of
grain
came
pouring
in
from
the
farms
the
cellars
were
full
of
the
abundance
of
the
gardens
golden
turnips
rosy
potatoes
and
rows
of
pale
green
cabbages
hanging
by
their
roots
to
the
beams
gave
an
air
of
security
against
the
long
cold
hungry
winter
inside
of
john
watson
home
in
spite
of
november
dullness
joy
and
gladness
reigned
for
was
not

so
soon
the
younger
children
whose
appetites
were
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
supply
were
often
tided
over
what
might
have
been
a
tearful
time
by
a
promise
of
the
good
time
coming
when
danny
cried
because
the
bottom
of
his
porridge
plate
was
always
stickin
through
and
later
in
the
same
day
came
home
in
the
same
unmanned
condition
because
he
had
smelled
chickens
cooking
down
at
the
hotel
when
he
and
jimmy
went
with
the
milk
mary
rose
to
the
occasion
and
told
him
in
a
wild
flight
of
unwarranted
extravagance
that
they
would
have
a
turkey
when
pearl
came
home
cranberry
sauce
brown
gravy
the
house
had
undergone
some
preparations
for
the
joyous
event
everything
was
scrubbed

be
scrubbed
an
elaborately
scalloped
newspaper
drape
ornamented
the
clock
shelf
paper
chains
made
of
blue
and
yellow
were
festooned
from
the
elbow
of
the
stove
pipes
to
the
window
curtains
the
wood
box
was
freshly
papered
with
newspaper
red
flannel

put
in
the
lamps
the
children
were
scrubbed
until
they
shone
bugsey
sweater
had
a
hole
in
the
chist
but
you
would
never
know
it
the
way
he
held
his
hand
tommy
stocking
had
a
hole
in
the
knee
but
he
had
artfully
inserted
a
piece
of
black
lining
that
by
careful
watching
kept
up
appearances
watson
instigated
by
danny
had
looked
at
the
turkeys
in
the
butcher
shop
that
morning
asked
the
price
and
came
away
sorrowful
even
danny
understood
that
a
turkey
was
not
to
be
thought
of
they
compromised
on
a
because
it
makes
so
much
gravy
and
with
this
and
the
prospect
of
potatoes
and
turnips
and
the
family
had
to
be
content
on
the
day
that
pearlie
was
expected
home
watson
and
mary
were
busy
preparing
the
evening
meal
although
it
was
still
quite
early
in
the
afternoon
wee
danny
stood
on
a
syrup
keg
in
front
of
the
window
determined
to
be
the
first
to
see
pearlie
watson
was
peeling
the
potatoes
and
singing
watson
sang
because
her
heart
was
glad
for
was
not
pearlie
coming
home
she
never
allowed
her
singing
to
interfere
with
more
urgent
duties
the
singing
could
always
wait
and
she
never
forgot
just
where
she
had
left
it
but
would
come
back
and
pick
up
at
the
exact
place
she
had
discarded
it
sure
ai
it
great
the
way

because
she
could
help

for
pearlie

from
greenland
icy
mountains
from
india
coral

a
shout
sounded
outside
and
bugsey
came
tumbling
in
and
said
he
thought
he
had
seen
pearlie
coming
away
down
the
road
across
the
track
whereupon
danny
cried
so
uproariously
that
bugsey
like
the
gentleman
he
was
withdrew
his
statement
or
at
least
modified
it
by
saying
it
might
be
pearlie
and
it
might
not
but
it
was
pearl
sure
enough
and
danny
had
the
pleasure
of
giving
the
alarm
beating
on
the
window
maudlin
with
happiness
while
pearl
said
to
tom
motherwell
who
had
brought
her
home
tommy
and
bugsey
and
patsey
waited
giggling
just
inside
the
door
while
mary
and
watson
went
out
to
greet
her
pearl
was
in
at
last
kissing
every
little
last
watson
forgetting
she
had
done
tommy
and
doing
him
over
again
with
danny
holding
tightly
to
her
skirt
through
it
all
everybody
talking
at
once
then
the
excitement
calmed
down
somewhat
but
only
to
break
right
out
again
for
jimmy
who
had
been
downtown
came
home
and
found
the
box
which
tom
motherwell
had
left
on
the
step
after
pearl
had
gone
in
they
carried
it
in
excitedly
and
eager
little
hands
raised
the
lid
eager
little
voices
shouted
with
delight

tell

with

they
were
put
in
a
row
upon
their
mother
bed
to
be
out
of
the
way
while
the
supper
was
being
prepared
all
except
wee
bugsey
who
went
from
choice
down
to
the
tracks
to
see
the
cars
getting
loaded
the
sizzle
of
the
turkey
in
the
oven
made
the
tears
come
two
hours
later
the
watson
family
sat
down
to
supper
not
in
sections
but
the
whole
family
the
table
had
long
since
been
inadequate
to
the
family
needs
but
two
boards
with
a
on
them
from
the
end
of
it
to
the
washing
machine
overcame
the
difficulty
was
there
ever
such
a
turkey
as
that
one
watson
carved
it
herself
on
the
back
of
the
stove
sure
yer
poor
father
ca
be
bothered
with
it
and
it
a
thing
he
ai
handy
at
mirover
no
meself
but
the
atin
is
on
it
praise
god
and
we
git
at
it
someway
ten
plates
were
heaped
full
of
potatoes
and
turnips
turkey
brown
gravy
and
stuffin
and
still
that
mammoth
turkey
had
layers
of
meat
upon
his
giant
sides
what
did
it
matter
if
there
were
not
enough
plates
to
go
around
and
tommy
had
to
eat
his
supper
out
of
the
saucepan
and
even
if
there
were
no
cups
for
the
boys
was
not
the
pail
with
the
dipper
in
it
just
behind
them
on
the
old
when
the
plates
had
all
been
cleaned
the
second
time
and
the
turkey
began
to
look
as
if
something
had
happened
to
it
mary
brought
in
the
surprise
of
the
evening
it
was
the
jelly
evans
had
sent
them
when
she
let
mary
come
home
early
in
the
afternoon
a
present
from
algernon
she
said
and
the
whipped
cream
that
camilla
had
given
jimmy
when
he
ran
over
to
tell
her
and
francis
that
pearlie
had
really
come
then
everyone
saw
the
advantage
of
having
their
plates
licked
clean
and
not
having
more
turkey
than
they
knew
what
to
do
with
danny
was
inarticulate
with
happiness
lift
me
down
pearlie
he
murmured
sleepily
as
he
poked
down
the
last
spoonful
and
do
not
jiggle
me
when
patsey
and
bugsey
and
tommy
and
danny
had
gone
to
bed
and
mary
and
watson
were
washing
the
dishes
pearlie
was
not
allowed
to
help
being
the
guest
of
honour
john
watson
sat
silently
smoking
his
pipe
listening
with
delight
while
pearl
related
her
experiences
of
the
last
three
months
she
was
telling
about
the
night
that
she
had
watched
for
the
doctor
not
a
word
did
she
tell
about
her
friend
the
doctor
agitation
nor
what
had
caused
it
on
that
occasion
and
she
was
very
much
relieved
to
find
that
her
listeners
did
not
seem
to
have
heard
about
the
circumstances
of
ab
cowan
death
oh
i
tell
ye
doctor
clay
the
fellow
she
said
her
eyes
sparkling
with
enthusiasm
he
knew
what
was
wrong
wid
arthur
the
minute
he
clapped
his
eyes
on
him
tore
open
his
little
satchel
slapped
the
chloroform
into
his
face
whisked
out
his
knives
and
slashed
into
him
as
aisy
as
ma
wud
into
a
pair
of
pants
for
jimmie
there
and
him
waitin
for
them
look
at
that
now
her
father
exclaimed
pulling
out
the
damper
of
the
stove
and
spitting
in
the
ashes
yon
a
man
make
his
mark
wherever
he
goes
a
knock
sounded
on
the
door
teddy
opened
it
and
admitted
camilla
and
jim
russell
i
got
a
letter
for
you
pearl
jim
said
when
the
greetings
were
over
when
tom
brought
the
mail
this
evening
this
letter
for
you
was
in
with
the
others
and
arthur
brought
it
over
to
see
if
i
would
bring
it
in
i
did
really
want
to
come
but
seeing
as
it
was
for
you
pearl
i
came
camilla
was
not
listening
to
him
at
all
pearl
took
the
letter
wonderingly
read
it
camilla
she
said
handing
it
to
her
friend
camilla
broke
the
seal
and
read
it
it
was
from
alfred
austin
wemyss
rector
of
agnes
tillbury
road
county
of
kent
england
it
was
a
stately
letter
becoming
a
rector
dignified
and
chaste
in
its
language
it
was
the
letter
of
a
dignitary
of
the
church
to
an
unknown
and
obscure
child
in
a
distant
land
but
it
told
of
a
father
and
mother
gratitude
for
a
son
life
saved
it
breathed
an
admiration
for
the
little
girl
devotion
and
heroism
and
a
love
for
her
that
would
last
as
long
as
life
itself
pearl
sat
in
mute
wonder
as
camilla
read
that
could
not
mean
her
we
do
not
mean
to
offer
money
as
a
payment
for
what
you
have
done
dear
child
camilla
read
on
for
such
a
service
of
love
can
only
be
paid
in
love
but
we
ask
you
to
accept
from
us
this
gift
as
our
own
daughter
would
accept
it
if
we
had
had
one
and
we
will
be
glad
to
think
that
it
has
been
a
help
to
you
in
the
securing
of
an
education
our
brother
the
bishop
wishes
you
to
take
from
him
a
gift
of
pounds
and
it
is
his
desire
that
you
should
spend
it
in
whatever
way
will
give
you
the
most
pleasure
we
are
dear
pearl
your
grateful
friends
alfred
and
mary
wemyss
here
is
a
bank
of
england
draft
for
pounds
nearly
camilla
said
as
she
finished
the
letter
the
watson
family
sat
dumb
with
astonishment
god
help
us
watson
cried
at
last
he
has
camilla
said
reverently
then
pearl
threw
her
arms
around
her
mother
neck
and
kissed
her
over
and
over
again
ma
dear
she
cried
ye
git
it
now
what
i
always
wanted
ye
to
have
a
cape
and
not
lined
wid
rabbit
or
squirrel
or
skunk
either
but
with
the
real
vermin
and
it
was
bad
luck
to
have
mcguire
cross
me
path
when
i
was
going
out
but
they
ca
mane
me
camilla
sure
what
did
i
do
but
camilla
and
jim
stood
firm
the
money
was
for
her
and
her
only
everyone
knew
jim
said
that
if
she
had
not
stayed
with
arthur
that
long
night
and
watched
for
the
doctor
that
arthur
would
have
been
dead
in
the
morning
and
arthur
had
told
him
a
dozen
times
jim
said
that
pearl
had
saved
his
life
well
then
was
aisy
saved
pearl
declared
if
i
saved
it
just
then
clay
came
in
with
a
letter
in
his
hand
my
business
is
with
this
young
lady
he
said
as
he
sat
on
the
chair
watson
had
wiped
for
him
and
drew
pearl
gently
toward
him
pearl
i
got
some
money
that
does
belong
to
me
so
did
i
pearl
said
no
you
deserve
all
yours
but
i
do
deserve
a
cent
if
it
been
for
this
little
girl
of
yours
watson
that
young
englishman
would
have
been
a
dead
man
faith
that
what
they
do
be
sayin
but
i
do
see
how
that
wuz
you
the
man
yerself
doc
john
replied
taking
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
no
the
doctor
went
on
i
would
have
let
him
die
if
pearl
held
me
up
to
it
and
made
me
operate
pearl
sprang
up
almost
in
tears
doc
she
cried
indignantly
have
i
towld
ye
a
dozen
times
not
to
say
that
where
yer
sense
doc
the
doctor
laughed
he
could
laugh
about
it
now
since
barner
had
quite
exonerated
him
from
blame
in
the
matter
and
given
it
as
his
professional
opinion
that
young
cowan
would
have
died
any
way
the
lancing
of
his
throat
having
perhaps
hastened
but
did
not
cause
his
death
pearl
the
doctor
said
smiling
arthur
father
sent
me
pounds
and
a
letter
that
will
make
me
blush
every
time
i
think
of
it
now
i
can
not
take
the
money
the
operation
no
doubt
saved
his
life
but
if
it
had
been
for
you
there
would
have
been
no
operation
i
want
you
to
take
the
money
if
you
do
not
i
will
have
to
send
it
back
to
arthur
father
and
tell
him
all
about
it
pearl
looked
at
him
in
real
distress
and
i
tell
everyone
else
too
what
kind
of
a
man
i
am
jim
here
knows
it
already
the
doctor
eyes
were
smiling
as
he
watched
her
troubled
little
face
oh
doctor
clay
she
cried
you
worse
danny
when
you
get
a
notion
inter
yer
head
what
kin
i
do
with
ye
i
do
not
know
the
doctor
laughed
unless
you
marry
me
when
you
grow
up
well
pearl
answered
gravely
i
ca
do
that
till
ma
and
me
git
the
family
raised
but
i
thinkin
maybe
mary
barner
might
take
ye
i
thought
of
that
too
the
doctor
answered
while
a
slight
shadow
passed
over
his
face
but
she
seems
to
think
not
however
i
not
in
a
hurry
pearl
and
i
just
think
i
wait
for
you
after
camilla
and
jim
and
the
doctor
had
gone
that
night
and
teddy
and
billy
and
jimmy
had
gone
to
bed
pearl
crept
into
her
father
arms
and
laid
her
head
on
his
broad
shoulder
pa
she
said
drowsily
i
glad
i
home
her
father
patted
her
little
brown
hand
so
am
i
acushla
he
said
after
a
pause
he
whispered
yer
a
good
wee
girl
pearlie
but
pearl
tired
little
eyes
had
closed
in
sleep
watson
laid
more
wood
on
the
fire
which
crackled
merrily
up
the
chimney
lay
her
down
john
dear
she
whispered
yer
arms
ache
man
on
the
back
of
the
stove
the
teakettle
simmered
drowsily
there
was
no
sound
in
the
house
but
the
regular
breathing
of
the
sleeping
children
the
fire
burned
low
but
john
watson
still
sat
holding
his
little
sleeping
girl
in
his
arms
outside
the
snow
was
beginning
to
fall
conclusion
convincing
camilla
if
you
can
convince
me
jim
that
you
are
more
irresponsible
and
more
in
need
of
a
guiding
hand
than
francis
why
then
i
i
be
jim
sprang
from
his
chair
you
be
what
camilla
tell
me
quick
he
cried
eagerly
i
be
convinced
she
said
demurely
looking
down
jim
sat
down
again
and
sighed
will
you
be
anything
else
he
asked
convince
me
first
she
said
firmly
i
think
i
can
do
it
he
said
i
always
have
to
write
down
what
i
want
to
do
each
day
and
what
i
need
to
buy
when
i
come
in
here
and
once
when
i
wrote
my
list
nails
coffee
ploughshare
mail
i
forgot
to
put
on
it
back
and
perhaps
you
may
remember
i
came
here
that
evening
and
stayed
and
stayed
i
was
trying
to
think
what
to
do
next
that
need
not
worry
you
again
jim
she
said
sweetly
i
can
easily
remember
that
and
will
tell
you
every
time
to
back
he
said
thank
you
camilla
and
i
will
do
it
too
she
laughed
having
to
make
a
list
is
anything
poor
francis
makes
a
list
and
then
loses
it
then
makes
a
second
list
and
puts
on
it
to
find
the
first
list
and
then
loses
that
and
jim
she
once
made
biscuits
and
forgot
the
shortening
i
made
biscuits
once
and
forgot
the
flour
jim
declared
proudly
camilla
shook
her
head
and
camilla
jim
said
gravely
i
am
really
very
irresponsible
you
know
nellie
slater
she
is
a
pretty
girl
is
she
a
very
pretty
girl
camilla
agreed
about
your
size
fluffy
hair
wavy
jim
camilla
corrected
hers
is
fluffy
yours
is
wavy
jim
said
firmly
lovely
dark
eyes
well
she
was
standing
by
the
window
just
before
the
lamps
were
lighted
and
i
really
am
very
you
know
i
do
know
how
it
happened
that
i
mistook
her
for
you
camilla
reached
out
her
hand
he
seized
it
eagerly
jim
i
am
convinced
she
said
softly
fifteen
minutes
afterwards
camilla
said
i
can
not
tell
her
jim
i
really
can
not
i
do
how
know
to
begin
to
tell
her
why
do
you
need
to
tell
her
jim
asked
has
the
lady
eyes
and
understanding
what
does
she
think
i
come
for
she
does
know
you
come
she
sees
somebody
here
but
she
thinks
the
waiting
until
i
empty
his
basket
indeed
jim
said
a
little
stiffly
which
one
i
wonder
do
you
remember
the
night
she
said
to
me
what
did
you
say
this
young
man
name
is
camilla
no
no
jim
she
has
noticed
you
at
all
jim
was
silent
a
moment
well
now
he
said
at
last
she
seemed
to
be
taking
notice
that
morning
i
came
in
without
any
very
good
excuse
and
she
said
does
it
happen
that
you
are
not
harvesting
this
beautiful
day
mr
russell
yes
and
what
did
you
say
camilla
asked
a
trifle
severely
jim
looked
a
little
embarrassed
i
said
i
had
not
felt
well
lately
and
i
had
come
in
to
see
the
doctor
and
what
was
that
camilla
was
still
stern
the
ingenious
device
of
an
ardent
lover
he
replied
quickly
sinner
you
mean
jim
she
laughed
but
the
next
time
you
had
a
splendid
excuse
you
had
a
message
from
pearl
was
my
new
suit
done
yes
and
then
i
came
to
see
there
was
a
of
skirts
in
the
hall
camilla
made
a
quick
move
and
jim
became
busy
with
the
books
on
the
table
francis
entered
camilla
she
began
after
she
had
spoken
cordially
to
jim
francis
is
in
need
of
a
young
man
to
manage
his
business
for
him
and
he
has
made
up
his
mind
quite
made
up
his
mind
camilla
to
take
russell
into
partnership
with
him
if
russell
will
agree
francis
needs
just
such
a
young
man
one
of
education
good
habits
and
business
ability
and
so
camilla
i
see
no
reason
why
your
marriage
should
not
take
place
at
once
marriage
camilla
gasped
yes
francis
said
in
her
richest
tones
your
marriage
camilla
at
once
you
are
engaged
are
you
not
i
am
convinced
camilla
said
irrelevantly
and
then
it
was
francis
who
laughed
as
she
held
out
a
hand
to
each
of
them
i
do
see
things
sometimes
she
said
