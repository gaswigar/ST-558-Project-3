index
introduction
what
is
the
idea
we
have
only
started
on
our
development
of
our
country
we
have
not
as
yet
with
all
our
talk
of
wonderful
progress
done
more
than
scratch
the
surface
the
progress
has
been
wonderful
enough
but
when
we
compare
what
we
have
done
with
what
there
is
to
do
then
our
past
accomplishments
are
as
nothing
when
we
consider
that
more
power
is
used
merely
in
ploughing
the
soil
than
is
used
in
all
the
industrial
establishments
of
the
country
put
together
an
inkling
comes
of
how
much
opportunity
there
is
ahead
and
now
with
so
many
countries
of
the
world
in
ferment
and
with
so
much
unrest
every
where
is
an
excellent
time
to
suggest
something
of
the
things
that
may
be
done
in
the
light
of
what
has
been
done
when
one
speaks
of
increasing
power
machinery
and
industry
there
comes
up
a
picture
of
a
cold
metallic
sort
of
world
in
which
great
factories
will
drive
away
the
trees
the
flowers
the
birds
and
the
green
fields
and
that
then
we
shall
have
a
world
composed
of
metal
machines
and
human
machines
with
all
of
that
i
do
not
agree
i
think
that
unless
we
know
more
about
machines
and
their
use
unless
we
better
understand
the
mechanical
portion
of
life
we
can
not
have
the
time
to
enjoy
the
trees
and
the
birds
and
the
flowers
and
the
green
fields
i
think
that
we
have
already
done
too
much
toward
banishing
the
pleasant
things
from
life
by
thinking
that
there
is
some
opposition
between
living
and
providing
the
means
of
living
we
waste
so
much
time
and
energy
that
we
have
little
left
over
in
which
to
enjoy
ourselves
power
and
machinery
money
and
goods
are
useful
only
as
they
set
us
free
to
live
they
are
but
means
to
an
end
for
instance
i
do
not
consider
the
machines
which
bear
my
name
simply
as
machines
if
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
i
would
do
something
else
i
take
them
as
concrete
evidence
of
the
working
out
of
a
theory
of
business
which
i
hope
is
something
more
than
a
theory
of
business
a
theory
that
looks
toward
making
this
world
a
better
place
in
which
to
live
the
fact
that
the
commercial
success
of
the
ford
motor
company
has
been
most
unusual
is
important
only
because
it
serves
to
demonstrate
in
a
way
which
no
one
can
fail
to
understand
that
the
theory
to
date
is
right
considered
solely
in
this
light
i
can
criticize
the
prevailing
system
of
industry
and
the
organization
of
money
and
society
from
the
standpoint
of
one
who
has
not
been
beaten
by
them
as
things
are
now
organized
i
could
were
i
thinking
only
selfishly
ask
for
no
change
if
i
merely
want
money
the
present
system
is
all
right
it
gives
money
in
plenty
to
me
but
i
am
thinking
of
service
the
present
system
does
not
permit
of
the
best
service
because
it
encourages
every
kind
of
waste
it
keeps
many
men
from
getting
the
full
return
from
service
and
it
is
going
nowhere
it
is
all
a
matter
of
better
planning
and
adjustment
i
have
no
quarrel
with
the
general
attitude
of
scoffing
at
new
ideas
it
is
better
to
be
skeptical
of
all
new
ideas
and
to
insist
upon
being
shown
rather
than
to
rush
around
in
a
continuous
brainstorm
after
every
new
idea
skepticism
if
by
that
we
mean
cautiousness
is
the
balance
wheel
of
civilization
most
of
the
present
acute
troubles
of
the
world
arise
out
of
taking
on
new
ideas
without
first
carefully
investigating
to
discover
if
they
are
good
ideas
an
idea
is
not
necessarily
good
because
it
is
old
or
necessarily
bad
because
it
is
new
but
if
an
old
idea
works
then
the
weight
of
the
evidence
is
all
in
its
favor
ideas
are
of
themselves
extraordinarily
valuable
but
an
idea
is
just
an
idea
almost
any
one
can
think
up
an
idea
the
thing
that
counts
is
developing
it
into
a
practical
product
i
am
now
most
interested
in
fully
demonstrating
that
the
ideas
we
have
put
into
practice
are
capable
of
the
largest
application
that
they
have
nothing
peculiarly
to
do
with
motor
cars
or
tractors
but
form
something
in
the
nature
of
a
universal
code
i
am
quite
certain
that
it
is
the
natural
code
and
i
want
to
demonstrate
it
so
thoroughly
that
it
will
be
accepted
not
as
a
new
idea
but
as
a
natural
code
the
natural
thing
to
do
is
to
work
to
recognize
that
prosperity
and
happiness
can
be
obtained
only
through
honest
effort
human
ills
flow
largely
from
attempting
to
escape
from
this
natural
course
i
have
no
suggestion
which
goes
beyond
accepting
in
its
fullest
this
principle
of
nature
i
take
it
for
granted
that
we
must
work
all
that
we
have
done
comes
as
the
result
of
a
certain
insistence
that
since
we
must
work
it
is
better
to
work
intelligently
and
forehandedly
that
the
better
we
do
our
work
the
better
off
we
shall
be
all
of
which
i
conceive
to
be
merely
elemental
common
sense
i
am
not
a
reformer
i
think
there
is
entirely
too
much
attempt
at
reforming
in
the
world
and
that
we
pay
too
much
attention
to
reformers
we
have
two
kinds
of
reformers
both
are
nuisances
the
man
who
calls
himself
a
reformer
wants
to
smash
things
he
is
the
sort
of
man
who
would
tear
up
a
whole
shirt
because
the
collar
button
did
not
fit
the
buttonhole
it
would
never
occur
to
him
to
enlarge
the
buttonhole
this
sort
of
reformer
never
under
any
circumstances
knows
what
he
is
doing
experience
and
reform
do
not
go
together
a
reformer
can
not
keep
his
zeal
at
white
heat
in
the
presence
of
a
fact
he
must
discard
all
facts
since
a
great
many
persons
have
received
intellectual
outfits
many
are
beginning
to
think
for
the
first
time
they
opened
their
eyes
and
realized
that
they
were
in
the
world
then
with
a
thrill
of
independence
they
realized
that
they
could
look
at
the
world
critically
they
did
so
and
found
it
faulty
the
intoxication
of
assuming
the
masterful
position
of
a
critic
of
the
social
system
which
it
is
every
man
right
to
assume
is
unbalancing
at
first
the
very
young
critic
is
very
much
unbalanced
he
is
strongly
in
favor
of
wiping
out
the
old
order
and
starting
a
new
one
they
actually
managed
to
start
a
new
world
in
russia
it
is
there
that
the
work
of
the
world
makers
can
best
be
studied
we
learn
from
russia
that
it
is
the
minority
and
not
the
majority
who
determine
destructive
action
we
learn
also
that
while
men
may
decree
social
laws
in
conflict
with
natural
laws
nature
vetoes
those
laws
more
ruthlessly
than
did
the
czars
nature
has
vetoed
the
whole
soviet
republic
for
it
sought
to
deny
nature
it
denied
above
all
else
the
right
to
the
fruits
of
labour
some
people
say
russia
will
have
to
go
to
work
but
that
does
not
describe
the
case
the
fact
is
that
poor
russia
is
at
work
but
her
work
counts
for
nothing
it
is
not
free
work
in
the
united
states
a
workman
works
eight
hours
a
day
in
russia
he
works
twelve
to
fourteen
in
the
united
states
if
a
workman
wishes
to
lay
off
a
day
or
a
week
and
is
able
to
afford
it
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
him
in
russia
under
sovietism
the
workman
goes
to
work
whether
he
wants
to
or
not
the
freedom
of
the
citizen
has
disappeared
in
the
discipline
of
a
monotony
in
which
all
are
treated
alike
that
is
slavery
freedom
is
the
right
to
work
a
decent
length
of
time
and
to
get
a
decent
living
for
doing
so
to
be
able
to
arrange
the
little
personal
details
of
one
own
life
it
is
the
aggregate
of
these
and
many
other
items
of
freedom
which
makes
up
the
great
idealistic
freedom
the
minor
forms
of
freedom
lubricate
the
everyday
life
of
all
of
us
russia
could
not
get
along
without
intelligence
and
experience
as
soon
as
she
began
to
run
her
factories
by
committees
they
went
to
rack
and
ruin
there
was
more
debate
than
production
as
soon
as
they
threw
out
the
skilled
man
thousands
of
tons
of
precious
materials
were
spoiled
the
fanatics
talked
the
people
into
starvation
the
soviets
are
now
offering
the
engineers
the
administrators
the
foremen
and
superintendents
whom
at
first
they
drove
out
large
sums
of
money
if
only
they
will
come
back
bolshevism
is
now
crying
for
the
brains
and
experience
which
it
yesterday
treated
so
ruthlessly
all
that
reform
did
to
russia
was
to
block
production
there
is
in
this
country
a
sinister
element
that
desires
to
creep
in
between
the
men
who
work
with
their
hands
and
the
men
who
think
and
plan
for
the
men
who
work
with
their
hands
the
same
influence
that
drove
the
brains
experience
and
ability
out
of
russia
is
busily
engaged
in
raising
prejudice
here
we
must
not
suffer
the
stranger
the
destroyer
the
hater
of
happy
humanity
to
divide
our
people
in
unity
is
american
strength
and
freedom
on
the
other
hand
we
have
a
different
kind
of
reformer
who
never
calls
himself
one
he
is
singularly
like
the
radical
reformer
the
radical
has
had
no
experience
and
does
not
want
it
the
other
class
of
reformer
has
had
plenty
of
experience
but
it
does
him
no
good
i
refer
to
the
reactionary
who
will
be
surprised
to
find
himself
put
in
exactly
the
same
class
as
the
bolshevist
he
wants
to
go
back
to
some
previous
condition
not
because
it
was
the
best
condition
but
because
he
thinks
he
knows
about
that
condition
the
one
crowd
wants
to
smash
up
the
whole
world
in
order
to
make
a
better
one
the
other
holds
the
world
as
so
good
that
it
might
well
be
let
stand
as
it
is
and
decay
the
second
notion
arises
as
does
the
first
out
of
not
using
the
eyes
to
see
with
it
is
perfectly
possible
to
smash
this
world
but
it
is
not
possible
to
build
a
new
one
it
is
possible
to
prevent
the
world
from
going
forward
but
it
is
not
possible
then
to
prevent
it
from
going
back
from
decaying
it
is
foolish
to
expect
that
if
everything
be
overturned
everyone
will
thereby
get
three
meals
a
day
or
should
everything
be
petrified
that
thereby
six
per
cent
interest
may
be
paid
the
trouble
is
that
reformers
and
reactionaries
alike
get
away
from
the
realities
from
the
primary
functions
one
of
the
counsels
of
caution
is
to
be
very
certain
that
we
do
not
mistake
a
reactionary
turn
for
a
return
of
common
sense
we
have
passed
through
a
period
of
fireworks
of
every
description
and
the
making
of
a
great
many
idealistic
maps
of
progress
we
did
not
get
anywhere
it
was
a
convention
not
a
march
lovely
things
were
said
but
when
we
got
home
we
found
the
furnace
out
reactionaries
have
frequently
taken
advantage
of
the
recoil
from
such
a
period
and
they
have
promised
the
good
old
times
which
usually
means
the
bad
old
abuses
and
because
they
are
perfectly
void
of
vision
they
are
sometimes
regarded
as
practical
men
their
return
to
power
is
often
hailed
as
the
return
of
common
sense
the
primary
functions
are
agriculture
manufacture
and
transportation
community
life
is
impossible
without
them
they
hold
the
world
together
raising
things
making
things
and
earning
things
are
as
primitive
as
human
need
and
yet
as
modern
as
anything
can
be
they
are
of
the
essence
of
physical
life
when
they
cease
community
life
ceases
things
do
get
out
of
shape
in
this
present
world
under
the
present
system
but
we
may
hope
for
a
betterment
if
the
foundations
stand
sure
the
great
delusion
is
that
one
may
change
the
foundation
usurp
the
part
of
destiny
in
the
social
process
the
foundations
of
society
are
the
men
and
means
to
things
to
things
and
to
things
as
long
as
agriculture
manufacture
and
transportation
survive
the
world
can
survive
any
economic
or
social
change
as
we
serve
our
jobs
we
serve
the
world
there
is
plenty
of
work
to
do
business
is
merely
work
speculation
in
things
already
produced
that
is
not
business
it
is
just
more
or
less
respectable
graft
but
it
can
not
be
legislated
out
of
existence
laws
can
do
very
little
law
never
does
anything
constructive
it
can
never
be
more
than
a
policeman
and
so
it
is
a
waste
of
time
to
look
to
our
state
capitals
or
to
washington
to
do
that
which
law
was
not
designed
to
do
as
long
as
we
look
to
legislation
to
cure
poverty
or
to
abolish
special
privilege
we
are
going
to
see
poverty
spread
and
special
privilege
grow
we
have
had
enough
of
looking
to
washington
and
we
have
had
enough
of
legislators
not
so
much
however
in
this
as
in
other
countries
promising
laws
to
do
that
which
laws
can
not
do
when
you
get
a
whole
country
as
did
ours
thinking
that
washington
is
a
sort
of
heaven
and
behind
its
clouds
dwell
omniscience
and
omnipotence
you
are
educating
that
country
into
a
dependent
state
of
mind
which
augurs
ill
for
the
future
our
help
does
not
come
from
washington
but
from
ourselves
our
help
may
however
go
to
washington
as
a
sort
of
central
distribution
point
where
all
our
efforts
are
coordinated
for
the
general
good
we
may
help
the
government
the
government
can
not
help
us
the
slogan
of
less
government
in
business
and
more
business
in
government
is
a
very
good
one
not
mainly
on
account
of
business
or
government
but
on
account
of
the
people
business
is
not
the
reason
why
the
united
states
was
founded
the
declaration
of
independence
is
not
a
business
charter
nor
is
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
a
commercial
schedule
the
united
states
its
land
people
government
and
business
are
but
methods
by
which
the
life
of
the
people
is
made
worth
while
the
government
is
a
servant
and
never
should
be
anything
but
a
servant
the
moment
the
people
become
adjuncts
to
government
then
the
law
of
retribution
begins
to
work
for
such
a
relation
is
unnatural
immoral
and
inhuman
we
can
not
live
without
business
and
we
can
not
live
without
government
business
and
government
are
necessary
as
servants
like
water
and
grain
as
masters
they
overturn
the
natural
order
the
welfare
of
the
country
is
squarely
up
to
us
as
individuals
that
is
where
it
should
be
and
that
is
where
it
is
safest
governments
can
promise
something
for
nothing
but
they
can
not
deliver
they
can
juggle
the
currencies
as
they
did
in
europe
and
as
bankers
the
world
over
do
as
long
as
they
can
get
the
benefit
of
the
juggling
with
a
patter
of
solemn
nonsense
but
it
is
work
and
work
alone
that
can
continue
to
deliver
the
goods
and
that
down
in
his
heart
is
what
every
man
knows
there
is
little
chance
of
an
intelligent
people
such
as
ours
ruining
the
fundamental
processes
of
economic
life
most
men
know
they
can
not
get
something
for
nothing
most
men
feel
even
if
they
do
not
know
that
money
is
not
wealth
the
ordinary
theories
which
promise
everything
to
everybody
and
demand
nothing
from
anybody
are
promptly
denied
by
the
instincts
of
the
ordinary
man
even
when
he
does
not
find
reasons
against
them
he
they
are
wrong
that
is
enough
the
present
order
always
clumsy
often
stupid
and
in
many
ways
imperfect
has
this
advantage
over
any
other
it
works
doubtless
our
order
will
merge
by
degrees
into
another
and
the
new
one
will
also
work
but
not
so
much
by
reason
of
what
it
is
as
by
reason
of
what
men
will
bring
into
it
the
reason
why
bolshevism
did
not
work
and
can
not
work
is
not
economic
it
does
not
matter
whether
industry
is
privately
managed
or
socially
controlled
it
does
not
matter
whether
you
call
the
workers
share
wages
or
dividends
it
does
not
matter
whether
you
regimentalize
the
people
as
to
food
clothing
and
shelter
or
whether
you
allow
them
to
eat
dress
and
live
as
they
like
those
are
mere
matters
of
detail
the
incapacity
of
the
bolshevist
leaders
is
indicated
by
the
fuss
they
made
over
such
details
bolshevism
failed
because
it
was
both
unnatural
and
immoral
our
system
stands
is
it
wrong
of
course
it
is
wrong
at
a
thousand
points
is
it
clumsy
of
course
it
is
clumsy
by
all
right
and
reason
it
ought
to
break
down
but
it
does
not
because
it
is
instinct
with
certain
economic
and
moral
fundamentals
the
economic
fundamental
is
labour
labour
is
the
human
element
which
makes
the
fruitful
seasons
of
the
earth
useful
to
men
it
is
labour
that
makes
the
harvest
what
it
is
that
is
the
economic
fundamental
every
one
of
us
is
working
with
material
which
we
did
not
and
could
not
create
but
which
was
presented
to
us
by
nature
the
moral
fundamental
is
man
right
in
his
labour
this
is
variously
stated
it
is
sometimes
called
the
right
of
property
it
is
sometimes
masked
in
the
command
thou
shalt
not
steal
it
is
the
other
right
in
his
property
that
makes
stealing
a
crime
when
a
man
has
earned
his
bread
he
has
a
right
to
that
bread
if
another
steals
it
he
does
more
than
steal
bread
he
invades
a
sacred
human
right
if
we
can
not
produce
we
can
not
have
but
some
say
if
we
produce
it
is
only
for
the
capitalists
capitalists
who
become
such
because
they
provide
better
means
of
production
are
of
the
foundation
of
society
they
have
really
nothing
of
their
own
they
merely
manage
property
for
the
benefit
of
others
capitalists
who
become
such
through
trading
in
money
are
a
temporarily
necessary
evil
they
may
not
be
evil
at
all
if
their
money
goes
to
production
if
their
money
goes
to
complicating
distribution
to
raising
barriers
between
the
producer
and
the
consumer
then
they
are
evil
capitalists
and
they
will
pass
away
when
money
is
better
adjusted
to
work
and
money
will
become
better
adjusted
to
work
when
it
is
fully
realized
that
through
work
and
work
alone
may
health
wealth
and
happiness
inevitably
be
secured
there
is
no
reason
why
a
man
who
is
willing
to
work
should
not
be
able
to
work
and
to
receive
the
full
value
of
his
work
there
is
equally
no
reason
why
a
man
who
can
but
will
not
work
should
not
receive
the
full
value
of
his
services
to
the
community
he
should
most
certainly
be
permitted
to
take
away
from
the
community
an
equivalent
of
what
he
contributes
to
it
if
he
contributes
nothing
he
should
take
away
nothing
he
should
have
the
freedom
of
starvation
we
are
not
getting
anywhere
when
we
insist
that
every
man
ought
to
have
more
than
he
deserves
to
have
just
because
some
do
get
more
than
they
deserve
to
have
there
can
be
no
greater
absurdity
and
no
greater
disservice
to
humanity
in
general
than
to
insist
that
all
men
are
equal
most
certainly
all
men
are
not
equal
and
any
democratic
conception
which
strives
to
make
men
equal
is
only
an
effort
to
block
progress
men
can
not
be
of
equal
service
the
men
of
larger
ability
are
less
numerous
than
the
men
of
smaller
ability
it
is
possible
for
a
mass
of
the
smaller
men
to
pull
the
larger
ones
down
but
in
so
doing
they
pull
themselves
down
it
is
the
larger
men
who
give
the
leadership
to
the
community
and
enable
the
smaller
men
to
live
with
less
effort
the
conception
of
democracy
which
names
a
of
ability
makes
for
waste
no
two
things
in
nature
are
alike
we
build
our
cars
absolutely
interchangeable
all
parts
are
as
nearly
alike
as
chemical
analysis
the
finest
machinery
and
the
finest
workmanship
can
make
them
no
fitting
of
any
kind
is
required
and
it
would
certainly
seem
that
two
fords
standing
side
by
side
looking
exactly
alike
and
made
so
exactly
alike
that
any
part
could
be
taken
out
of
one
and
put
into
the
other
would
be
alike
but
they
are
not
they
will
have
different
road
habits
we
have
men
who
have
driven
hundreds
and
in
some
cases
thousands
of
fords
and
they
say
that
no
two
ever
act
precisely
the
same
that
if
they
should
drive
a
new
car
for
an
hour
or
even
less
and
then
the
car
were
mixed
with
a
bunch
of
other
new
ones
also
each
driven
for
a
single
hour
and
under
the
same
conditions
that
although
they
could
not
recognize
the
car
they
had
been
driving
merely
by
looking
at
it
they
could
do
so
by
driving
it
i
have
been
speaking
in
general
terms
let
us
be
more
concrete
a
man
ought
to
be
able
to
live
on
a
scale
commensurate
with
the
service
that
he
renders
this
is
rather
a
good
time
to
talk
about
this
point
for
we
have
recently
been
through
a
period
when
the
rendering
of
service
was
the
last
thing
that
most
people
thought
of
we
were
getting
to
a
place
where
no
one
cared
about
costs
or
service
orders
came
without
effort
whereas
once
it
was
the
customer
who
favored
the
merchant
by
dealing
with
him
conditions
changed
until
it
was
the
merchant
who
favored
the
customer
by
selling
to
him
that
is
bad
for
business
monopoly
is
bad
for
business
profiteering
is
bad
for
business
the
lack
of
necessity
to
hustle
is
bad
for
business
business
is
never
as
healthy
as
when
like
a
chicken
it
must
do
a
certain
amount
of
scratching
for
what
it
gets
things
were
coming
too
easily
there
was
a
of
the
principle
that
an
honest
relation
ought
to
obtain
between
values
and
prices
the
public
no
longer
had
to
be
catered
to
there
was
even
a
public
be
damned
attitude
in
many
places
it
was
intensely
bad
for
business
some
men
called
that
abnormal
condition
prosperity
it
was
not
prosperity
it
was
just
a
needless
money
chase
money
chasing
is
not
business
it
is
very
easy
unless
one
keeps
a
plan
thoroughly
in
mind
to
get
burdened
with
money
and
then
in
an
effort
to
make
more
money
to
forget
all
about
selling
to
the
people
what
they
want
business
on
a
basis
is
most
insecure
it
is
a
affair
moving
irregularly
and
rarely
over
a
term
of
years
amounting
to
much
it
is
the
function
of
business
to
produce
for
consumption
and
not
for
money
or
speculation
producing
for
consumption
implies
that
the
quality
of
the
article
produced
will
be
high
and
that
the
price
will
be
low
that
the
article
be
one
which
serves
the
people
and
not
merely
the
producer
if
the
money
feature
is
twisted
out
of
its
proper
perspective
then
the
production
will
be
twisted
to
serve
the
producer
the
producer
depends
for
his
prosperity
upon
serving
the
people
he
may
get
by
for
a
while
serving
himself
but
if
he
does
it
will
be
purely
accidental
and
when
the
people
wake
up
to
the
fact
that
they
are
not
being
served
the
end
of
that
producer
is
in
sight
during
the
boom
period
the
larger
effort
of
production
was
to
serve
itself
and
hence
the
moment
the
people
woke
up
many
producers
went
to
smash
they
said
that
they
had
entered
into
a
period
of
depression
really
they
had
not
they
were
simply
trying
to
pit
nonsense
against
sense
which
is
something
that
can
not
successfully
be
done
being
greedy
for
money
is
the
surest
way
not
to
get
it
but
when
one
serves
for
the
sake
of
service
for
the
satisfaction
of
doing
that
which
one
believes
to
be
right
then
money
abundantly
takes
care
of
itself
money
comes
naturally
as
the
result
of
service
and
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
have
money
but
we
do
not
want
to
forget
that
the
end
of
money
is
not
ease
but
the
opportunity
to
perform
more
service
in
my
mind
nothing
is
more
abhorrent
than
a
life
of
ease
none
of
us
has
any
right
to
ease
there
is
no
place
in
civilization
for
the
idler
any
scheme
looking
to
abolishing
money
is
only
making
affairs
more
complex
for
we
must
have
a
measure
that
our
present
system
of
money
is
a
satisfactory
basis
for
exchange
is
a
matter
of
grave
doubt
that
is
a
question
which
i
shall
talk
of
in
a
subsequent
chapter
the
gist
of
my
objection
to
the
present
monetary
system
is
that
it
tends
to
become
a
thing
of
itself
and
to
block
instead
of
facilitate
production
my
effort
is
in
the
direction
of
simplicity
people
in
general
have
so
little
and
it
costs
so
much
to
buy
even
the
barest
necessities
let
alone
that
share
of
the
luxuries
to
which
i
think
everyone
is
entitled
because
nearly
everything
that
we
make
is
much
more
complex
than
it
needs
to
be
our
clothing
our
food
our
household
furnishings
all
could
be
much
simpler
than
they
now
are
and
at
the
same
time
be
better
looking
things
in
past
ages
were
made
in
certain
ways
and
makers
since
then
have
just
followed
i
do
not
mean
that
we
should
adopt
freak
styles
there
is
no
necessity
for
that
clothing
need
not
be
a
bag
with
a
hole
cut
in
it
that
might
be
easy
to
make
but
it
would
be
inconvenient
to
wear
a
blanket
does
not
require
much
tailoring
but
none
of
us
could
get
much
work
done
if
we
went
around
in
blankets
real
simplicity
means
that
which
gives
the
very
best
service
and
is
the
most
convenient
in
use
the
trouble
with
drastic
reforms
is
they
always
insist
that
a
man
be
made
over
in
order
to
use
certain
designed
articles
i
think
that
dress
reform
for
women
which
seems
to
mean
ugly
clothes
must
always
originate
with
plain
women
who
want
to
make
everyone
else
look
plain
that
is
not
the
right
process
start
with
an
article
that
suits
and
then
study
to
find
some
way
of
eliminating
the
entirely
useless
parts
this
applies
to
everything
a
shoe
a
dress
a
house
a
piece
of
machinery
a
railroad
a
steamship
an
airplane
as
we
cut
out
useless
parts
and
simplify
necessary
ones
we
also
cut
down
the
cost
of
making
this
is
simple
logic
but
oddly
enough
the
ordinary
process
starts
with
a
cheapening
of
the
manufacturing
instead
of
with
a
simplifying
of
the
article
the
start
ought
to
be
with
the
article
first
we
ought
to
find
whether
it
is
as
well
made
as
it
should
be
does
it
give
the
best
possible
service
then
are
the
materials
the
best
or
merely
the
most
expensive
then
can
its
complexity
and
weight
be
cut
down
and
so
on
there
is
no
more
sense
in
having
extra
weight
in
an
article
than
there
is
in
the
cockade
on
a
coachman
hat
in
fact
there
is
not
as
much
for
the
cockade
may
help
the
coachman
to
identify
his
hat
while
the
extra
weight
means
only
a
waste
of
strength
i
can
not
imagine
where
the
delusion
that
weight
means
strength
came
from
it
is
all
well
enough
in
a
but
why
move
a
heavy
weight
if
we
are
not
going
to
hit
anything
with
it
in
transportation
why
put
extra
weight
in
a
machine
why
not
add
it
to
the
load
that
the
machine
is
designed
to
carry
fat
men
can
not
run
as
fast
as
thin
men
but
we
build
most
of
our
vehicles
as
though
fat
increased
speed
a
deal
of
poverty
grows
out
of
the
carriage
of
excess
weight
some
day
we
shall
discover
how
further
to
eliminate
weight
take
wood
for
example
for
certain
purposes
wood
is
now
the
best
substance
we
know
but
wood
is
extremely
wasteful
the
wood
in
a
ford
car
contains
thirty
pounds
of
water
there
must
be
some
way
of
doing
better
than
that
there
must
be
some
method
by
which
we
can
gain
the
same
strength
and
elasticity
without
having
to
lug
useless
weight
and
so
through
a
thousand
processes
the
farmer
makes
too
complex
an
affair
out
of
his
daily
work
i
believe
that
the
average
farmer
puts
to
a
really
useful
purpose
only
about
per
cent
of
the
energy
that
he
spends
if
any
one
ever
equipped
a
factory
in
the
style
say
the
average
farm
is
fitted
out
the
place
would
be
cluttered
with
men
the
worst
factory
in
europe
is
hardly
as
bad
as
the
average
farm
barn
power
is
utilized
to
the
least
possible
degree
not
only
is
everything
done
by
hand
but
seldom
is
a
thought
given
to
logical
arrangement
a
farmer
doing
his
chores
will
walk
up
and
down
a
rickety
ladder
a
dozen
times
he
will
carry
water
for
years
instead
of
putting
in
a
few
lengths
of
pipe
his
whole
idea
when
there
is
extra
work
to
do
is
to
hire
extra
men
he
thinks
of
putting
money
into
improvements
as
an
expense
farm
products
at
their
lowest
prices
are
dearer
than
they
ought
to
be
farm
profits
at
their
highest
are
lower
than
they
ought
to
be
it
is
waste
motion
waste
effort
that
makes
farm
prices
high
and
profits
low
on
my
own
farm
at
dearborn
we
do
everything
by
machinery
we
have
eliminated
a
great
number
of
wastes
but
we
have
not
as
yet
touched
on
real
economy
we
have
not
yet
been
able
to
put
in
five
or
ten
years
of
intense
study
to
discover
what
really
ought
to
be
done
we
have
left
more
undone
than
we
have
done
yet
at
no
time
no
matter
what
the
value
of
crops
have
we
failed
to
turn
a
profit
we
are
not
farmers
we
are
industrialists
on
the
farm
the
moment
the
farmer
considers
himself
as
an
industrialist
with
a
horror
of
waste
either
in
material
or
in
men
then
we
are
going
to
have
farm
products
so
that
all
will
have
enough
to
eat
and
the
profits
will
be
so
satisfactory
that
farming
will
be
considered
as
among
the
least
hazardous
and
most
profitable
of
occupations
lack
of
knowledge
of
what
is
going
on
and
lack
of
knowledge
of
what
the
job
really
is
and
the
best
way
of
doing
it
are
the
reasons
why
farming
is
thought
not
to
pay
nothing
could
pay
the
way
farming
is
conducted
the
farmer
follows
luck
and
his
forefathers
he
does
not
know
how
economically
to
produce
and
he
does
not
know
how
to
market
a
manufacturer
who
knew
how
neither
to
produce
nor
to
market
would
not
long
stay
in
business
that
the
farmer
can
stay
on
shows
how
wonderfully
profitable
farming
can
be
the
way
to
attain
production
in
the
factory
or
on
the
farm
and
production
means
plenty
for
everyone
is
quite
simple
the
trouble
is
that
the
general
tendency
is
to
complicate
very
simple
affairs
take
for
an
instance
an
improvement
when
we
talk
about
improvements
usually
we
have
in
mind
some
change
in
a
product
an
improved
product
is
one
that
has
been
changed
that
is
not
my
idea
i
do
not
believe
in
starting
to
make
until
i
have
discovered
the
best
possible
thing
this
of
course
does
not
mean
that
a
product
should
never
be
changed
but
i
think
that
it
will
be
found
more
economical
in
the
end
not
even
to
try
to
produce
an
article
until
you
have
fully
satisfied
yourself
that
utility
design
and
material
are
the
best
if
your
researches
do
not
give
you
that
confidence
then
keep
right
on
searching
until
you
find
confidence
the
place
to
start
manufacturing
is
with
the
article
the
factory
the
organization
the
selling
and
the
financial
plans
will
shape
themselves
to
the
article
you
will
have
a
cutting
edge
on
your
business
chisel
and
in
the
end
you
will
save
time
rushing
into
manufacturing
without
being
certain
of
the
product
is
the
unrecognized
cause
of
many
business
failures
people
seem
to
think
that
the
big
thing
is
the
factory
or
the
store
or
the
financial
backing
or
the
management
the
big
thing
is
the
product
and
any
hurry
in
getting
into
fabrication
before
designs
are
completed
is
just
so
much
waste
time
i
spent
twelve
years
before
i
had
a
model
t
which
is
what
is
known
as
the
ford
car
that
suited
me
we
did
not
attempt
to
go
into
real
production
until
we
had
a
real
product
that
product
has
not
been
essentially
changed
we
are
constantly
experimenting
with
new
ideas
if
you
travel
the
roads
in
the
neighbourhood
of
dearborn
you
can
find
all
sorts
of
models
of
ford
cars
they
are
experimental
cars
they
are
not
new
models
i
do
not
believe
in
letting
any
good
idea
get
by
me
but
i
will
not
quickly
decide
whether
an
idea
is
good
or
bad
if
an
idea
seems
good
or
seems
even
to
have
possibilities
i
believe
in
doing
whatever
is
necessary
to
test
out
the
idea
from
every
angle
but
testing
out
the
idea
is
something
very
different
from
making
a
change
in
the
car
where
most
manufacturers
find
themselves
quicker
to
make
a
change
in
the
product
than
in
the
method
of
manufacturing
we
follow
exactly
the
opposite
course
our
big
changes
have
been
in
methods
of
manufacturing
they
never
stand
still
i
believe
that
there
is
hardly
a
single
operation
in
the
making
of
our
car
that
is
the
same
as
when
we
made
our
first
car
of
the
present
model
that
is
why
we
make
them
so
cheaply
the
few
changes
that
have
been
made
in
the
car
have
been
in
the
direction
of
convenience
in
use
or
where
we
found
that
a
change
in
design
might
give
added
strength
the
materials
in
the
car
change
as
we
learn
more
and
more
about
materials
also
we
do
not
want
to
be
held
up
in
production
or
have
the
expense
of
production
increased
by
any
possible
shortage
in
a
particular
material
so
we
have
for
most
parts
worked
out
substitute
materials
vanadium
steel
for
instance
is
our
principal
steel
with
it
we
can
get
the
greatest
strength
with
the
least
weight
but
it
would
not
be
good
business
to
let
our
whole
future
depend
upon
being
able
to
get
vanadium
steel
we
have
worked
out
a
substitute
all
our
steels
are
special
but
for
every
one
of
them
we
have
at
least
one
and
sometimes
several
fully
proved
and
tested
substitutes
and
so
on
through
all
of
our
materials
and
likewise
with
our
parts
in
the
beginning
we
made
very
few
of
our
parts
and
none
of
our
motors
now
we
make
all
our
motors
and
most
of
our
parts
because
we
find
it
cheaper
to
do
so
but
also
we
aim
to
make
some
of
every
part
so
that
we
can
not
be
caught
in
any
market
emergency
or
be
crippled
by
some
outside
manufacturer
being
unable
to
fill
his
orders
the
prices
on
glass
were
run
up
outrageously
high
during
the
war
we
are
among
the
largest
users
of
glass
in
the
country
now
we
are
putting
up
our
own
glass
factory
if
we
had
devoted
all
of
this
energy
to
making
changes
in
the
product
we
should
be
nowhere
but
by
not
changing
the
product
we
are
able
to
give
our
energy
to
the
improvement
of
the
making
the
principal
part
of
a
chisel
is
the
cutting
edge
if
there
is
a
single
principle
on
which
our
business
rests
it
is
that
it
makes
no
difference
how
finely
made
a
chisel
is
or
what
splendid
steel
it
has
in
it
or
how
well
it
is
forged
if
it
has
no
cutting
edge
it
is
not
a
chisel
it
is
just
a
piece
of
metal
all
of
which
being
translated
means
that
it
is
what
a
thing
does
not
what
it
is
supposed
to
do
that
matters
what
is
the
use
of
putting
a
tremendous
force
behind
a
blunt
chisel
if
a
light
blow
on
a
sharp
chisel
will
do
the
work
the
chisel
is
there
to
cut
not
to
be
hammered
the
hammering
is
only
incidental
to
the
job
so
if
we
want
to
work
why
not
concentrate
on
the
work
and
do
it
in
the
quickest
possible
fashion
the
cutting
edge
of
merchandising
is
the
point
where
the
product
touches
the
consumer
an
unsatisfactory
product
is
one
that
has
a
dull
cutting
edge
a
lot
of
waste
effort
is
needed
to
put
it
through
the
cutting
edge
of
a
factory
is
the
man
and
the
machine
on
the
job
if
the
man
is
not
right
the
machine
can
not
be
if
the
machine
is
not
right
the
man
can
not
be
for
any
one
to
be
required
to
use
more
force
than
is
absolutely
necessary
for
the
job
in
hand
is
waste
the
essence
of
my
idea
then
is
that
waste
and
greed
block
the
delivery
of
true
service
both
waste
and
greed
are
unnecessary
waste
is
due
largely
to
not
understanding
what
one
does
or
being
careless
in
doing
of
it
greed
is
merely
a
species
of
nearsightedness
i
have
striven
toward
manufacturing
with
a
minimum
of
waste
both
of
materials
and
of
human
effort
and
then
toward
distribution
at
a
minimum
of
profit
depending
for
the
total
profit
upon
the
volume
of
distribution
in
the
process
of
manufacturing
i
want
to
distribute
the
maximum
of
wage
that
is
the
maximum
of
buying
power
since
also
this
makes
for
a
minimum
cost
and
we
sell
at
a
minimum
profit
we
can
distribute
a
product
in
consonance
with
buying
power
thus
everyone
who
is
connected
with
us
either
as
a
manager
worker
or
purchaser
is
the
better
for
our
existence
the
institution
that
we
have
erected
is
performing
a
service
that
is
the
only
reason
i
have
for
talking
about
it
the
principles
of
that
service
are
these
an
absence
of
fear
of
the
future
and
of
veneration
for
the
past
one
who
fears
the
future
who
fears
failure
limits
his
activities
failure
is
only
the
opportunity
more
intelligently
to
begin
again
there
is
no
disgrace
in
honest
failure
there
is
disgrace
in
fearing
to
fail
what
is
past
is
useful
only
as
it
suggests
ways
and
means
for
progress
a
disregard
of
competition
whoever
does
a
thing
best
ought
to
be
the
one
to
do
it
it
is
criminal
to
try
to
get
business
away
from
another
man
criminal
because
one
is
then
trying
to
lower
for
personal
gain
the
condition
of
one
fellow
man
to
rule
by
force
instead
of
by
intelligence
the
putting
of
service
before
profit
without
a
profit
business
can
not
extend
there
is
nothing
inherently
wrong
about
making
a
profit
business
enterprise
can
not
fail
to
return
a
profit
but
profit
must
and
inevitably
will
come
as
a
reward
for
good
service
it
can
not
be
the
basis
it
must
be
the
result
of
service
manufacturing
is
not
buying
low
and
selling
high
it
is
the
process
of
buying
materials
fairly
and
with
the
smallest
possible
addition
of
cost
transforming
those
materials
into
a
consumable
product
and
giving
it
to
the
consumer
gambling
speculating
and
sharp
dealing
tend
only
to
clog
this
progression
how
all
of
this
arose
how
it
has
worked
out
and
how
it
applies
generally
are
the
subjects
of
these
chapters
chapter
i
the
beginning
of
business
on
may
the
ford
motor
company
turned
out
car
no
it
is
out
in
my
museum
along
with
the
gasoline
buggy
that
i
began
work
on
thirty
years
before
and
which
first
ran
satisfactorily
along
in
the
spring
of
i
was
running
it
when
the
bobolinks
came
to
dearborn
and
they
always
come
on
april
there
is
all
the
difference
in
the
world
in
the
appearance
of
the
two
vehicles
and
almost
as
much
difference
in
construction
and
materials
but
in
fundamentals
the
two
are
curiously
alike
except
that
the
old
buggy
has
on
it
a
few
wrinkles
that
we
have
not
yet
quite
adopted
in
our
modern
car
for
that
first
car
or
buggy
even
though
it
had
but
two
cylinders
would
make
twenty
miles
an
hour
and
run
sixty
miles
on
the
three
gallons
of
gas
the
little
tank
held
and
is
as
good
as
the
day
it
was
built
the
development
in
methods
of
manufacture
and
in
materials
has
been
greater
than
the
development
in
basic
design
the
whole
design
has
been
refined
the
present
ford
car
which
is
the
model
t
has
four
cylinders
and
a
self
starter
it
is
in
every
way
a
more
convenient
and
an
easier
riding
car
it
is
simpler
than
the
first
car
but
almost
every
point
in
it
may
be
found
also
in
the
first
car
the
changes
have
been
brought
about
through
experience
in
the
making
and
not
through
any
change
in
the
basic
principle
which
i
take
to
be
an
important
fact
demonstrating
that
given
a
good
idea
to
start
with
it
is
better
to
concentrate
on
perfecting
it
than
to
hunt
around
for
a
new
idea
one
idea
at
a
time
is
about
as
much
as
any
one
can
handle
it
was
life
on
the
farm
that
drove
me
into
devising
ways
and
means
to
better
transportation
i
was
born
on
july
on
a
farm
at
dearborn
michigan
and
my
earliest
recollection
is
that
considering
the
results
there
was
too
much
work
on
the
place
that
is
the
way
i
still
feel
about
farming
there
is
a
legend
that
my
parents
were
very
poor
and
that
the
early
days
were
hard
ones
certainly
they
were
not
rich
but
neither
were
they
poor
as
michigan
farmers
went
we
were
prosperous
the
house
in
which
i
was
born
is
still
standing
and
it
and
the
farm
are
part
of
my
present
holding
there
was
too
much
hard
hand
labour
on
our
own
and
all
other
farms
of
the
time
even
when
very
young
i
suspected
that
much
might
somehow
be
done
in
a
better
way
that
is
what
took
me
into
mechanics
although
my
mother
always
said
that
i
was
born
a
mechanic
i
had
a
kind
of
workshop
with
odds
and
ends
of
metal
for
tools
before
i
had
anything
else
in
those
days
we
did
not
have
the
toys
of
what
we
had
were
home
made
my
toys
were
all
tools
they
still
are
and
every
fragment
of
machinery
was
a
treasure
the
biggest
event
of
those
early
years
was
meeting
with
a
road
engine
about
eight
miles
out
of
detroit
one
day
when
we
were
driving
to
town
i
was
then
twelve
years
old
the
second
biggest
event
was
getting
a
watch
which
happened
in
the
same
year
i
remember
that
engine
as
though
i
had
seen
it
only
yesterday
for
it
was
the
first
vehicle
other
than
that
i
had
ever
seen
it
was
intended
primarily
for
driving
threshing
machines
and
sawmills
and
was
simply
a
portable
engine
and
boiler
mounted
on
wheels
with
a
water
tank
and
coal
cart
trailing
behind
i
had
seen
plenty
of
these
engines
hauled
around
by
horses
but
this
one
had
a
chain
that
made
a
connection
between
the
engine
and
the
rear
wheels
of
the
frame
on
which
the
boiler
was
mounted
the
engine
was
placed
over
the
boiler
and
one
man
standing
on
the
platform
behind
the
boiler
shoveled
coal
managed
the
throttle
and
did
the
steering
it
had
been
made
by
nichols
shepard
company
of
battle
creek
i
found
that
out
at
once
the
engine
had
stopped
to
let
us
pass
with
our
horses
and
i
was
off
the
wagon
and
talking
to
the
engineer
before
my
father
who
was
driving
knew
what
i
was
up
to
the
engineer
was
very
glad
to
explain
the
whole
affair
he
was
proud
of
it
he
showed
me
how
the
chain
was
disconnected
from
the
propelling
wheel
and
a
belt
put
on
to
drive
other
machinery
he
told
me
that
the
engine
made
two
hundred
revolutions
a
minute
and
that
the
chain
pinion
could
be
shifted
to
let
the
wagon
stop
while
the
engine
was
still
running
this
last
is
a
feature
which
although
in
different
fashion
is
incorporated
into
modern
automobiles
it
was
not
important
with
steam
engines
which
are
easily
stopped
and
started
but
it
became
very
important
with
the
gasoline
engine
it
was
that
engine
which
took
me
into
automotive
transportation
i
tried
to
make
models
of
it
and
some
years
later
i
did
make
one
that
ran
very
well
but
from
the
time
i
saw
that
road
engine
as
a
boy
of
twelve
right
forward
to
my
great
interest
has
been
in
making
a
machine
that
would
travel
the
roads
driving
to
town
i
always
had
a
pocket
full
of
trinkets
nuts
washers
and
odds
and
ends
of
machinery
often
i
took
a
broken
watch
and
tried
to
put
it
together
when
i
was
thirteen
i
managed
for
the
first
time
to
put
a
watch
together
so
that
it
would
keep
time
by
the
time
i
was
fifteen
i
could
do
almost
anything
in
watch
repairing
although
my
tools
were
of
the
crudest
there
is
an
immense
amount
to
be
learned
simply
by
tinkering
with
things
it
is
not
possible
to
learn
from
books
how
everything
is
made
and
a
real
mechanic
ought
to
know
how
nearly
everything
is
made
machines
are
to
a
mechanic
what
books
are
to
a
writer
he
gets
ideas
from
them
and
if
he
has
any
brains
he
will
apply
those
ideas
from
the
beginning
i
never
could
work
up
much
interest
in
the
labour
of
farming
i
wanted
to
have
something
to
do
with
machinery
my
father
was
not
entirely
in
sympathy
with
my
bent
toward
mechanics
he
thought
that
i
ought
to
be
a
farmer
when
i
left
school
at
seventeen
and
became
an
apprentice
in
the
machine
shop
of
the
drydock
engine
works
i
was
all
but
given
up
for
lost
i
passed
my
apprenticeship
without
trouble
that
is
i
was
qualified
to
be
a
machinist
long
before
my
term
had
expired
and
having
a
liking
for
fine
work
and
a
leaning
toward
watches
i
worked
nights
at
repairing
in
a
jewelry
shop
at
one
period
of
those
early
days
i
think
that
i
must
have
had
fully
three
hundred
watches
i
thought
that
i
could
build
a
serviceable
watch
for
around
thirty
cents
and
nearly
started
in
the
business
but
i
did
not
because
i
figured
out
that
watches
were
not
universal
necessities
and
therefore
people
generally
would
not
buy
them
just
how
i
reached
that
surprising
conclusion
i
am
unable
to
state
i
did
not
like
the
ordinary
jewelry
and
watch
making
work
excepting
where
the
job
was
hard
to
do
even
then
i
wanted
to
make
something
in
quantity
it
was
just
about
the
time
when
the
standard
railroad
time
was
being
arranged
we
had
formerly
been
on
sun
time
and
for
quite
a
while
just
as
in
our
present
days
the
railroad
time
differed
from
the
local
time
that
bothered
me
a
good
deal
and
so
i
succeeded
in
making
a
watch
that
kept
both
times
it
had
two
dials
and
it
was
quite
a
curiosity
in
the
neighbourhood
in
that
is
about
four
years
after
i
first
saw
that
machine
i
managed
to
get
a
chance
to
run
one
and
when
my
apprenticeship
was
over
i
worked
with
a
local
representative
of
the
westinghouse
company
of
schenectady
as
an
expert
in
the
setting
up
and
repair
of
their
road
engines
the
engine
they
put
out
was
much
the
same
as
the
engine
excepting
that
the
engine
was
up
in
front
the
boiler
in
the
rear
and
the
power
was
applied
to
the
back
wheels
by
a
belt
they
could
make
twelve
miles
an
hour
on
the
road
even
though
the
feature
was
only
an
incident
of
the
construction
they
were
sometimes
used
as
tractors
to
pull
heavy
loads
and
if
the
owner
also
happened
to
be
in
the
business
he
hitched
his
threshing
machine
and
other
paraphernalia
to
the
engine
in
moving
from
farm
to
farm
what
bothered
me
was
the
weight
and
the
cost
they
weighed
a
couple
of
tons
and
were
far
too
expensive
to
be
owned
by
other
than
a
farmer
with
a
great
deal
of
land
they
were
mostly
employed
by
people
who
went
into
threshing
as
a
business
or
who
had
sawmills
or
some
other
line
that
required
portable
power
even
before
that
time
i
had
the
idea
of
making
some
kind
of
a
light
steam
car
that
would
take
the
place
of
horses
more
especially
however
as
a
tractor
to
attend
to
the
excessively
hard
labour
of
ploughing
it
occurred
to
me
as
i
remember
somewhat
vaguely
that
precisely
the
same
idea
might
be
applied
to
a
carriage
or
a
wagon
on
the
road
a
horseless
carriage
was
a
common
idea
people
had
been
talking
about
carriages
without
horses
for
many
years
back
in
fact
ever
since
the
steam
engine
was
invented
but
the
idea
of
the
carriage
at
first
did
not
seem
so
practical
to
me
as
the
idea
of
an
engine
to
do
the
harder
farm
work
and
of
all
the
work
on
the
farm
ploughing
was
the
hardest
our
roads
were
poor
and
we
had
not
the
habit
of
getting
around
one
of
the
most
remarkable
features
of
the
automobile
on
the
farm
is
the
way
that
it
has
broadened
the
farmer
life
we
simply
took
for
granted
that
unless
the
errand
were
urgent
we
would
not
go
to
town
and
i
think
we
rarely
made
more
than
a
trip
a
week
in
bad
weather
we
did
not
go
even
that
often
being
a
machinist
and
with
a
very
fair
workshop
on
the
farm
it
was
not
difficult
for
me
to
build
a
steam
wagon
or
tractor
in
the
building
of
it
came
the
idea
that
perhaps
it
might
be
made
for
road
use
i
felt
perfectly
certain
that
horses
considering
all
the
bother
of
attending
them
and
the
expense
of
feeding
did
not
earn
their
keep
the
obvious
thing
to
do
was
to
design
and
build
a
steam
engine
that
would
be
light
enough
to
run
an
ordinary
wagon
or
to
pull
a
plough
i
thought
it
more
important
first
to
develop
the
tractor
to
lift
farm
drudgery
off
flesh
and
blood
and
lay
it
on
steel
and
motors
has
been
my
most
constant
ambition
it
was
circumstances
that
took
me
first
into
the
actual
manufacture
of
road
cars
i
found
eventually
that
people
were
more
interested
in
something
that
would
travel
on
the
road
than
in
something
that
would
do
the
work
on
the
farms
in
fact
i
doubt
that
the
light
farm
tractor
could
have
been
introduced
on
the
farm
had
not
the
farmer
had
his
eyes
opened
slowly
but
surely
by
the
automobile
but
that
is
getting
ahead
of
the
story
i
thought
the
farmer
would
be
more
interested
in
the
tractor
i
built
a
steam
car
that
ran
it
had
a
boiler
and
it
developed
plenty
of
power
and
a
neat
control
which
is
so
easy
with
a
steam
throttle
but
the
boiler
was
dangerous
to
get
the
requisite
power
without
too
big
and
heavy
a
power
plant
required
that
the
engine
work
under
high
pressure
sitting
on
a
steam
boiler
is
not
altogether
pleasant
to
make
it
even
reasonably
safe
required
an
excess
of
weight
that
nullified
the
economy
of
the
high
pressure
for
two
years
i
kept
experimenting
with
various
sorts
of
boilers
the
engine
and
control
problems
were
simple
enough
and
then
i
definitely
abandoned
the
whole
idea
of
running
a
road
vehicle
by
steam
i
knew
that
in
england
they
had
what
amounted
to
locomotives
running
on
the
roads
hauling
lines
of
trailers
and
also
there
was
no
difficulty
in
designing
a
big
steam
tractor
for
use
on
a
large
farm
but
ours
were
not
then
english
roads
they
would
have
stalled
or
racked
to
pieces
the
strongest
and
heaviest
road
tractor
and
anyway
the
manufacturing
of
a
big
tractor
which
only
a
few
wealthy
farmers
could
buy
did
not
seem
to
me
worth
while
but
i
did
not
give
up
the
idea
of
a
horseless
carriage
the
work
with
the
westinghouse
representative
only
served
to
confirm
the
opinion
i
had
formed
that
steam
was
not
suitable
for
light
vehicles
that
is
why
i
stayed
only
a
year
with
that
company
there
was
nothing
more
that
the
big
steam
tractors
and
engines
could
teach
me
and
i
did
not
want
to
waste
time
on
something
that
would
lead
nowhere
a
few
years
before
it
was
while
i
was
an
apprentice
i
read
in
the
of
an
english
publication
of
the
silent
gas
engine
which
was
then
coming
out
in
england
i
think
it
was
the
otto
engine
it
ran
with
illuminating
gas
had
a
single
large
cylinder
and
the
power
impulses
being
thus
intermittent
required
an
extremely
heavy
as
far
as
weight
was
concerned
it
gave
nothing
like
the
power
per
pound
of
metal
that
a
steam
engine
gave
and
the
use
of
illuminating
gas
seemed
to
dismiss
it
as
even
a
possibility
for
road
use
it
was
interesting
to
me
only
as
all
machinery
was
interesting
i
followed
in
the
english
and
american
magazines
which
we
got
in
the
shop
the
development
of
the
engine
and
most
particularly
the
hints
of
the
possible
replacement
of
the
illuminating
gas
fuel
by
a
gas
formed
by
the
vaporization
of
gasoline
the
idea
of
gas
engines
was
by
no
means
new
but
this
was
the
first
time
that
a
really
serious
effort
had
been
made
to
put
them
on
the
market
they
were
received
with
interest
rather
than
enthusiasm
and
i
do
not
recall
any
one
who
thought
that
the
internal
combustion
engine
could
ever
have
more
than
a
limited
use
all
the
wise
people
demonstrated
conclusively
that
the
engine
could
not
compete
with
steam
they
never
thought
that
it
might
carve
out
a
career
for
itself
that
is
the
way
with
wise
people
they
are
so
wise
and
practical
that
they
always
know
to
a
dot
just
why
something
can
not
be
done
they
always
know
the
limitations
that
is
why
i
never
employ
an
expert
in
full
bloom
if
ever
i
wanted
to
kill
opposition
by
unfair
means
i
would
endow
the
opposition
with
experts
they
would
have
so
much
good
advice
that
i
could
be
sure
they
would
do
little
work
the
gas
engine
interested
me
and
i
followed
its
progress
but
only
from
curiosity
until
about
or
when
the
steam
engine
being
discarded
as
the
motive
power
for
the
carriage
that
i
intended
some
day
to
build
i
had
to
look
around
for
another
sort
of
motive
power
in
i
repaired
an
otto
engine
at
the
eagle
iron
works
in
detroit
no
one
in
town
knew
anything
about
them
there
was
a
rumour
that
i
did
and
although
i
had
never
before
been
in
contact
with
one
i
undertook
and
carried
through
the
job
that
gave
me
a
chance
to
study
the
new
engine
at
first
hand
and
in
i
built
one
on
the
otto
model
just
to
see
if
i
understood
the
principles
four
cycle
means
that
the
piston
traverses
the
cylinder
four
times
to
get
one
power
impulse
the
first
stroke
draws
in
the
gas
the
second
compresses
it
the
third
is
the
explosion
or
power
stroke
while
the
fourth
stroke
exhausts
the
waste
gas
the
little
model
worked
well
enough
it
had
a
bore
and
a
stroke
operated
with
gasoline
and
while
it
did
not
develop
much
power
it
was
slightly
lighter
in
proportion
than
the
engines
being
offered
commercially
i
gave
it
away
later
to
a
young
man
who
wanted
it
for
something
or
other
and
whose
name
i
have
forgotten
it
was
eventually
destroyed
that
was
the
beginning
of
the
work
with
the
internal
combustion
engine
i
was
then
on
the
farm
to
which
i
had
returned
more
because
i
wanted
to
experiment
than
because
i
wanted
to
farm
and
now
being
an
machinist
i
had
a
workshop
to
replace
the
toy
shop
of
earlier
days
my
father
offered
me
forty
acres
of
timber
land
provided
i
gave
up
being
a
machinist
i
agreed
in
a
provisional
way
for
cutting
the
timber
gave
me
a
chance
to
get
married
i
fitted
out
a
sawmill
and
a
portable
engine
and
started
to
cut
out
and
saw
up
the
timber
on
the
tract
some
of
the
first
of
that
lumber
went
into
a
cottage
on
my
new
farm
and
in
it
we
began
our
married
life
it
was
not
a
big
house
feet
square
and
only
a
story
and
a
half
high
but
it
was
a
comfortable
place
i
added
to
it
my
workshop
and
when
i
was
not
cutting
timber
i
was
working
on
the
gas
engines
learning
what
they
were
and
how
they
acted
i
read
everything
i
could
find
but
the
greatest
knowledge
came
from
the
work
a
gas
engine
is
a
mysterious
sort
of
thing
it
will
not
always
go
the
way
it
should
you
can
imagine
how
those
first
engines
acted
it
was
in
that
i
began
on
a
engine
it
was
quite
impractical
to
consider
the
single
cylinder
for
transportation
purposes
the
had
to
be
entirely
too
heavy
between
making
the
first
engine
of
the
otto
type
and
the
start
on
a
double
cylinder
i
had
made
a
great
many
experimental
engines
out
of
tubing
i
fairly
knew
my
way
about
the
double
cylinder
i
thought
could
be
applied
to
a
road
vehicle
and
my
original
idea
was
to
put
it
on
a
bicycle
with
a
direct
connection
to
the
crankshaft
and
allowing
for
the
rear
wheel
of
the
bicycle
to
act
as
the
balance
wheel
the
speed
was
going
to
be
varied
only
by
the
throttle
i
never
carried
out
this
plan
because
it
soon
became
apparent
that
the
engine
gasoline
tank
and
the
various
necessary
controls
would
be
entirely
too
heavy
for
a
bicycle
the
plan
of
the
two
opposed
cylinders
was
that
while
one
would
be
delivering
power
the
other
would
be
exhausting
this
naturally
would
not
require
so
heavy
a
to
even
the
application
of
power
the
work
started
in
my
shop
on
the
farm
then
i
was
offered
a
job
with
the
detroit
electric
company
as
an
engineer
and
machinist
at
dollars
a
month
i
took
it
because
that
was
more
money
than
the
farm
was
bringing
me
and
i
had
decided
to
get
away
from
farm
life
anyway
the
timber
had
all
been
cut
we
rented
a
house
on
bagley
avenue
detroit
the
workshop
came
along
and
i
set
it
up
in
a
brick
shed
at
the
back
of
the
house
during
the
first
several
months
i
was
in
the
night
shift
at
the
plant
which
gave
me
very
little
time
for
experimenting
but
after
that
i
was
in
the
day
shift
and
every
night
and
all
of
every
saturday
night
i
worked
on
the
new
motor
i
can
not
say
that
it
was
hard
work
no
work
with
interest
is
ever
hard
i
always
am
certain
of
results
they
always
come
if
you
work
hard
enough
but
it
was
a
very
great
thing
to
have
my
wife
even
more
confident
than
i
was
she
has
always
been
that
way
i
had
to
work
from
the
ground
up
that
is
although
i
knew
that
a
number
of
people
were
working
on
horseless
carriages
i
could
not
know
what
they
were
doing
the
hardest
problems
to
overcome
were
in
the
making
and
breaking
of
the
spark
and
in
the
avoidance
of
excess
weight
for
the
transmission
the
steering
gear
and
the
general
construction
i
could
draw
on
my
experience
with
the
steam
tractors
in
i
completed
my
first
motor
car
but
it
was
not
until
the
spring
of
the
following
year
that
it
ran
to
my
satisfaction
this
first
car
had
something
of
the
appearance
of
a
buggy
there
were
two
cylinders
with
a
bore
and
a
stroke
set
side
by
side
and
over
the
rear
axle
i
made
them
out
of
the
exhaust
pipe
of
a
steam
engine
that
i
had
bought
they
developed
about
four
horsepower
the
power
was
transmitted
from
the
motor
to
the
countershaft
by
a
belt
and
from
the
countershaft
to
the
rear
wheel
by
a
chain
the
car
would
hold
two
people
the
seat
being
suspended
on
posts
and
the
body
on
elliptical
springs
there
were
two
speeds
one
of
ten
and
the
other
of
twenty
miles
per
hour
obtained
by
shifting
the
belt
which
was
done
by
a
clutch
lever
in
front
of
the
driving
seat
thrown
forward
the
lever
put
in
the
high
speed
thrown
back
the
low
speed
with
the
lever
upright
the
engine
could
run
free
to
start
the
car
it
was
necessary
to
turn
the
motor
over
by
hand
with
the
clutch
free
to
stop
the
car
one
simply
released
the
clutch
and
applied
the
foot
brake
there
was
no
reverse
and
speeds
other
than
those
of
the
belt
were
obtained
by
the
throttle
i
bought
the
iron
work
for
the
frame
of
the
carriage
and
also
the
seat
and
the
springs
the
wheels
were
wire
bicycle
wheels
with
rubber
tires
the
balance
wheel
i
had
cast
from
a
pattern
that
i
made
and
all
of
the
more
delicate
mechanism
i
made
myself
one
of
the
features
that
i
discovered
necessary
was
a
compensating
gear
that
permitted
the
same
power
to
be
applied
to
each
of
the
rear
wheels
when
turning
corners
the
machine
altogether
weighed
about
five
hundred
pounds
a
tank
under
the
seat
held
three
gallons
of
gasoline
which
was
fed
to
the
motor
through
a
small
pipe
and
a
mixing
valve
the
ignition
was
by
electric
spark
the
original
machine
was
or
to
be
more
accurate
the
motor
simply
was
not
cooled
at
all
i
found
that
on
a
run
of
an
hour
or
more
the
motor
heated
up
and
so
i
very
shortly
put
a
water
jacket
around
the
cylinders
and
piped
it
to
a
tank
in
the
rear
of
the
car
over
the
cylinders
nearly
all
of
these
various
features
had
been
planned
in
advance
that
is
the
way
i
have
always
worked
i
draw
a
plan
and
work
out
every
detail
on
the
plan
before
starting
to
build
for
otherwise
one
will
waste
a
great
deal
of
time
in
makeshifts
as
the
work
goes
on
and
the
finished
article
will
not
have
coherence
it
will
not
be
rightly
proportioned
many
inventors
fail
because
they
do
not
distinguish
between
planning
and
experimenting
the
largest
building
difficulties
that
i
had
were
in
obtaining
the
proper
materials
the
next
were
with
tools
there
had
to
be
some
adjustments
and
changes
in
details
of
the
design
but
what
held
me
up
most
was
that
i
had
neither
the
time
nor
the
money
to
search
for
the
best
material
for
each
part
but
in
the
spring
of
the
machine
was
running
to
my
partial
satisfaction
and
giving
an
opportunity
further
to
test
out
the
design
and
material
on
the
road
chapter
ii
what
i
learned
about
business
my
gasoline
buggy
was
the
first
and
for
a
long
time
the
only
automobile
in
detroit
it
was
considered
to
be
something
of
a
nuisance
for
it
made
a
racket
and
it
scared
horses
also
it
blocked
traffic
for
if
i
stopped
my
machine
anywhere
in
town
a
crowd
was
around
it
before
i
could
start
up
again
if
i
left
it
alone
even
for
a
minute
some
inquisitive
person
always
tried
to
run
it
finally
i
had
to
carry
a
chain
and
chain
it
to
a
lamp
post
whenever
i
left
it
anywhere
and
then
there
was
trouble
with
the
police
i
do
not
know
quite
why
for
my
impression
is
that
there
were
no
laws
in
those
days
anyway
i
had
to
get
a
special
permit
from
the
mayor
and
thus
for
a
time
enjoyed
the
distinction
of
being
the
only
licensed
chauffeur
in
america
i
ran
that
machine
about
one
thousand
miles
through
and
and
then
sold
it
to
charles
ainsley
of
detroit
for
two
hundred
dollars
that
was
my
first
sale
i
had
built
the
car
not
to
sell
but
only
to
experiment
with
i
wanted
to
start
another
car
ainsley
wanted
to
buy
i
could
use
the
money
and
we
had
no
trouble
in
agreeing
upon
a
price
it
was
not
at
all
my
idea
to
make
cars
in
any
such
petty
fashion
i
was
looking
ahead
to
production
but
before
that
could
come
i
had
to
have
something
to
produce
it
does
not
pay
to
hurry
i
started
a
second
car
in
it
was
much
like
the
first
but
a
little
lighter
it
also
had
the
belt
drive
which
i
did
not
give
up
until
some
time
later
the
belts
were
all
right
excepting
in
hot
weather
that
is
why
i
later
adopted
gears
i
learned
a
great
deal
from
that
car
others
in
this
country
and
abroad
were
building
cars
by
that
time
and
in
i
heard
that
a
benz
car
from
germany
was
on
exhibition
in
macy
store
in
new
york
i
traveled
down
to
look
at
it
but
it
had
no
features
that
seemed
worth
while
it
also
had
the
belt
drive
but
it
was
much
heavier
than
my
car
i
was
working
for
lightness
the
foreign
makers
have
never
seemed
to
appreciate
what
light
weight
means
i
built
three
cars
in
all
in
my
home
shop
and
all
of
them
ran
for
years
in
detroit
i
still
have
the
first
car
i
bought
it
back
a
few
years
later
from
a
man
to
whom
ainsley
had
sold
it
i
paid
one
hundred
dollars
for
it
during
all
this
time
i
kept
my
position
with
the
electric
company
and
gradually
advanced
to
chief
engineer
at
a
salary
of
one
hundred
and
dollars
a
month
but
my
experiments
were
no
more
popular
with
the
president
of
the
company
than
my
first
mechanical
leanings
were
with
my
father
it
was
not
that
my
employer
objected
to
experiments
only
to
experiments
with
a
gas
engine
i
can
still
hear
him
say
electricity
yes
that
the
coming
thing
but
gas
no
he
had
ample
grounds
for
his
skepticism
to
use
the
mildest
terms
practically
no
one
had
the
remotest
notion
of
the
future
of
the
internal
combustion
engine
while
we
were
just
on
the
edge
of
the
great
electrical
development
as
with
every
comparatively
new
idea
electricity
was
expected
to
do
much
more
than
we
even
now
have
any
indication
that
it
can
do
i
did
not
see
the
use
of
experimenting
with
electricity
for
my
purposes
a
road
car
could
not
run
on
a
trolley
even
if
trolley
wires
had
been
less
expensive
no
storage
battery
was
in
sight
of
a
weight
that
was
practical
an
electrical
car
had
of
necessity
to
be
limited
in
radius
and
to
contain
a
large
amount
of
motive
machinery
in
proportion
to
the
power
exerted
that
is
not
to
say
that
i
held
or
now
hold
electricity
cheaply
we
have
not
yet
begun
to
use
electricity
but
it
has
its
place
and
the
internal
combustion
engine
has
its
place
neither
can
substitute
for
the
other
which
is
exceedingly
fortunate
i
have
the
dynamo
that
i
first
had
charge
of
at
the
detroit
edison
company
when
i
started
our
canadian
plant
i
bought
it
from
an
office
building
to
which
it
had
been
sold
by
the
electric
company
had
it
revamped
a
little
and
for
several
years
it
gave
excellent
service
in
the
canadian
plant
when
we
had
to
build
a
new
power
plant
owing
to
the
increase
in
business
i
had
the
old
motor
taken
out
to
my
museum
a
room
out
at
dearborn
that
holds
a
great
number
of
my
mechanical
treasures
the
edison
company
offered
me
the
general
superintendency
of
the
company
but
only
on
condition
that
i
would
give
up
my
gas
engine
and
devote
myself
to
something
really
useful
i
had
to
choose
between
my
job
and
my
automobile
i
chose
the
automobile
or
rather
i
gave
up
the
job
there
was
really
nothing
in
the
way
of
a
choice
for
already
i
knew
that
the
car
was
bound
to
be
a
success
i
quit
my
job
on
august
and
went
into
the
automobile
business
it
might
be
thought
something
of
a
step
for
i
had
no
personal
funds
what
money
was
left
over
from
living
was
all
used
in
experimenting
but
my
wife
agreed
that
the
automobile
could
not
be
given
up
that
we
had
to
make
or
break
there
was
no
demand
for
automobiles
there
never
is
for
a
new
article
they
were
accepted
in
much
the
fashion
as
was
more
recently
the
airplane
at
first
the
horseless
carriage
was
considered
merely
a
freak
notion
and
many
wise
people
explained
with
particularity
why
it
could
never
be
more
than
a
toy
no
man
of
money
even
thought
of
it
as
a
commercial
possibility
i
can
not
imagine
why
each
new
means
of
transportation
meets
with
such
opposition
there
are
even
those
who
shake
their
heads
and
talk
about
the
luxury
of
the
automobile
and
only
grudgingly
admit
that
perhaps
the
motor
truck
is
of
some
use
but
in
the
beginning
there
was
hardly
any
one
who
sensed
that
the
automobile
could
be
a
large
factor
in
industry
the
most
optimistic
hoped
only
for
a
development
akin
to
that
of
the
bicycle
when
it
was
found
that
an
automobile
really
could
go
and
several
makers
started
to
put
out
cars
the
immediate
query
was
as
to
which
would
go
fastest
it
was
a
curious
but
natural
development
that
racing
idea
i
never
thought
anything
of
racing
but
the
public
refused
to
consider
the
automobile
in
any
light
other
than
as
a
fast
toy
therefore
later
we
had
to
race
the
industry
was
held
back
by
this
initial
racing
slant
for
the
attention
of
the
makers
was
diverted
to
making
fast
rather
than
good
cars
it
was
a
business
for
speculators
a
group
of
men
of
speculative
turn
of
mind
organized
as
soon
as
i
left
the
electric
company
the
detroit
automobile
company
to
exploit
my
car
i
was
the
chief
engineer
and
held
a
small
amount
of
the
stock
for
three
years
we
continued
making
cars
more
or
less
on
the
model
of
my
first
car
we
sold
very
few
of
them
i
could
get
no
support
at
all
toward
making
better
cars
to
be
sold
to
the
public
at
large
the
whole
thought
was
to
make
to
order
and
to
get
the
largest
price
possible
for
each
car
the
main
idea
seemed
to
be
to
get
the
money
and
being
without
authority
other
than
my
engineering
position
gave
me
i
found
that
the
new
company
was
not
a
vehicle
for
realizing
my
ideas
but
merely
a
concern
that
did
not
make
much
money
in
march
i
resigned
determined
never
again
to
put
myself
under
orders
the
detroit
automobile
company
later
became
the
cadillac
company
under
the
ownership
of
the
lelands
who
came
in
subsequently
i
rented
a
shop
a
brick
shed
at
park
place
to
continue
my
experiments
and
to
find
out
what
business
really
was
i
thought
that
it
must
be
something
different
from
what
it
had
proved
to
be
in
my
first
adventure
the
year
from
until
the
formation
of
the
ford
motor
company
was
practically
one
of
investigation
in
my
little
brick
shop
i
worked
on
the
development
of
a
motor
and
on
the
outside
i
tried
to
find
out
what
business
really
was
and
whether
it
needed
to
be
quite
so
selfish
a
scramble
for
money
as
it
seemed
to
be
from
my
first
short
experience
from
the
period
of
the
first
car
which
i
have
described
until
the
formation
of
my
present
company
i
built
in
all
about
cars
of
which
nineteen
or
twenty
were
built
with
the
detroit
automobile
company
the
automobile
had
passed
from
the
initial
stage
where
the
fact
that
it
could
run
at
all
was
enough
to
the
stage
where
it
had
to
show
speed
alexander
winton
of
cleveland
the
founder
of
the
winton
car
was
then
the
track
champion
of
the
country
and
willing
to
meet
all
comers
i
designed
a
enclosed
engine
of
a
more
compact
type
than
i
had
before
used
fitted
it
into
a
skeleton
chassis
found
that
i
could
make
speed
and
arranged
a
race
with
winton
we
met
on
the
grosse
point
track
at
detroit
i
beat
him
that
was
my
first
race
and
it
brought
advertising
of
the
only
kind
that
people
cared
to
read
the
public
thought
nothing
of
a
car
unless
it
made
speed
unless
it
beat
other
racing
cars
my
ambition
to
build
the
fastest
car
in
the
world
led
me
to
plan
a
motor
but
of
that
more
later
the
most
surprising
feature
of
business
as
it
was
conducted
was
the
large
attention
given
to
finance
and
the
small
attention
to
service
that
seemed
to
me
to
be
reversing
the
natural
process
which
is
that
the
money
should
come
as
the
result
of
work
and
not
before
the
work
the
second
feature
was
the
general
indifference
to
better
methods
of
manufacture
as
long
as
whatever
was
done
got
by
and
took
the
money
in
other
words
an
article
apparently
was
not
built
with
reference
to
how
greatly
it
could
serve
the
public
but
with
reference
solely
to
how
much
money
could
be
had
for
it
and
that
without
any
particular
care
whether
the
customer
was
satisfied
to
sell
him
was
enough
a
dissatisfied
customer
was
regarded
not
as
a
man
whose
trust
had
been
violated
but
either
as
a
nuisance
or
as
a
possible
source
of
more
money
in
fixing
up
the
work
which
ought
to
have
been
done
correctly
in
the
first
place
for
instance
in
automobiles
there
was
not
much
concern
as
to
what
happened
to
the
car
once
it
had
been
sold
how
much
gasoline
it
used
per
mile
was
of
no
great
moment
how
much
service
it
actually
gave
did
not
matter
and
if
it
broke
down
and
had
to
have
parts
replaced
then
that
was
just
hard
luck
for
the
owner
it
was
considered
good
business
to
sell
parts
at
the
highest
possible
price
on
the
theory
that
since
the
man
had
already
bought
the
car
he
simply
had
to
have
the
part
and
would
be
willing
to
pay
for
it
the
automobile
business
was
not
on
what
i
would
call
an
honest
basis
to
say
nothing
of
being
from
a
manufacturing
standpoint
on
a
scientific
basis
but
it
was
no
worse
than
business
in
general
that
was
the
period
it
may
be
remembered
in
which
many
corporations
were
being
floated
and
financed
the
bankers
who
before
then
had
confined
themselves
to
the
railroads
got
into
industry
my
idea
was
then
and
still
is
that
if
a
man
did
his
work
well
the
price
he
would
get
for
that
work
the
profits
and
all
financial
matters
would
care
for
themselves
and
that
a
business
ought
to
start
small
and
build
itself
up
and
out
of
its
earnings
if
there
are
no
earnings
then
that
is
a
signal
to
the
owner
that
he
is
wasting
his
time
and
does
not
belong
in
that
business
i
have
never
found
it
necessary
to
change
those
ideas
but
i
discovered
that
this
simple
formula
of
doing
good
work
and
getting
paid
for
it
was
supposed
to
be
slow
for
modern
business
the
plan
at
that
time
most
in
favor
was
to
start
off
with
the
largest
possible
capitalization
and
then
sell
all
the
stock
and
all
the
bonds
that
could
be
sold
whatever
money
happened
to
be
left
over
after
all
the
stock
and
expenses
and
promoters
charges
and
all
that
went
grudgingly
into
the
foundation
of
the
business
a
good
business
was
not
one
that
did
good
work
and
earned
a
fair
profit
a
good
business
was
one
that
would
give
the
opportunity
for
the
floating
of
a
large
amount
of
stocks
and
bonds
at
high
prices
it
was
the
stocks
and
bonds
not
the
work
that
mattered
i
could
not
see
how
a
new
business
or
an
old
business
could
be
expected
to
be
able
to
charge
into
its
product
a
great
big
bond
interest
and
then
sell
the
product
at
a
fair
price
i
have
never
been
able
to
see
that
i
have
never
been
able
to
understand
on
what
theory
the
original
investment
of
money
can
be
charged
against
a
business
those
men
in
business
who
call
themselves
financiers
say
that
money
is
worth
per
cent
or
per
cent
or
some
other
per
cent
and
that
if
a
business
has
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
invested
in
it
the
man
who
made
the
investment
is
entitled
to
charge
an
interest
payment
on
the
money
because
if
instead
of
putting
that
money
into
the
business
he
had
put
it
into
a
savings
bank
or
into
certain
securities
he
could
have
a
certain
fixed
return
therefore
they
say
that
a
proper
charge
against
the
operating
expenses
of
a
business
is
the
interest
on
this
money
this
idea
is
at
the
root
of
many
business
failures
and
most
service
failures
money
is
not
worth
a
particular
amount
as
money
it
is
not
worth
anything
for
it
will
do
nothing
of
itself
the
only
use
of
money
is
to
buy
tools
to
work
with
or
the
product
of
tools
therefore
money
is
worth
what
it
will
help
you
to
produce
or
buy
and
no
more
if
a
man
thinks
that
his
money
will
earn
per
cent
or
per
cent
he
ought
to
place
it
where
he
can
get
that
return
but
money
placed
in
a
business
is
not
a
charge
on
the
business
or
rather
should
not
be
it
ceases
to
be
money
and
becomes
or
should
become
an
engine
of
production
and
it
is
therefore
worth
what
it
produces
and
not
a
fixed
sum
according
to
some
scale
that
has
no
bearing
upon
the
particular
business
in
which
the
money
has
been
placed
any
return
should
come
after
it
has
produced
not
before
business
men
believed
that
you
could
do
anything
by
financing
it
if
it
did
not
go
through
on
the
first
financing
then
the
idea
was
to
refinance
the
process
of
refinancing
was
simply
the
game
of
sending
good
money
after
bad
in
the
majority
of
cases
the
need
of
refinancing
arises
from
bad
management
and
the
effect
of
refinancing
is
simply
to
pay
the
poor
managers
to
keep
up
their
bad
management
a
little
longer
it
is
merely
a
postponement
of
the
day
of
judgment
this
makeshift
of
refinancing
is
a
device
of
speculative
financiers
their
money
is
no
good
to
them
unless
they
can
connect
it
up
with
a
place
where
real
work
is
being
done
and
that
they
can
not
do
unless
somehow
that
place
is
poorly
managed
thus
the
speculative
financiers
delude
themselves
that
they
are
putting
their
money
out
to
use
they
are
not
they
are
putting
it
out
to
waste
i
determined
absolutely
that
never
would
i
join
a
company
in
which
finance
came
before
the
work
or
in
which
bankers
or
financiers
had
a
part
and
further
that
if
there
were
no
way
to
get
started
in
the
kind
of
business
that
i
thought
could
be
managed
in
the
interest
of
the
public
then
i
simply
would
not
get
started
at
all
for
my
own
short
experience
together
with
what
i
saw
going
on
around
me
was
quite
enough
proof
that
business
as
a
mere
game
was
not
worth
giving
much
thought
to
and
was
distinctly
no
place
for
a
man
who
wanted
to
accomplish
anything
also
it
did
not
seem
to
me
to
be
the
way
to
make
money
i
have
yet
to
have
it
demonstrated
that
it
is
the
way
for
the
only
foundation
of
real
business
is
service
a
manufacturer
is
not
through
with
his
customer
when
a
sale
is
completed
he
has
then
only
started
with
his
customer
in
the
case
of
an
automobile
the
sale
of
the
machine
is
only
something
in
the
nature
of
an
introduction
if
the
machine
does
not
give
service
then
it
is
better
for
the
manufacturer
if
he
never
had
the
introduction
for
he
will
have
the
worst
of
all
advertisements
a
dissatisfied
customer
there
was
something
more
than
a
tendency
in
the
early
days
of
the
automobile
to
regard
the
selling
of
a
machine
as
the
real
accomplishment
and
that
thereafter
it
did
not
matter
what
happened
to
the
buyer
that
is
the
shortsighted
attitude
if
a
salesman
is
paid
only
for
what
he
sells
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
he
is
going
to
exert
any
great
effort
on
a
customer
out
of
whom
no
more
commission
is
to
be
made
and
it
is
right
on
this
point
that
we
later
made
the
largest
selling
argument
for
the
ford
the
price
and
the
quality
of
the
car
would
undoubtedly
have
made
a
market
and
a
large
market
we
went
beyond
that
a
man
who
bought
one
of
our
cars
was
in
my
opinion
entitled
to
continuous
use
of
that
car
and
therefore
if
he
had
a
breakdown
of
any
kind
it
was
our
duty
to
see
that
his
machine
was
put
into
shape
again
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
in
the
success
of
the
ford
car
the
early
provision
of
service
was
an
outstanding
element
most
of
the
expensive
cars
of
that
period
were
ill
provided
with
service
stations
if
your
car
broke
down
you
had
to
depend
on
the
local
repair
man
when
you
were
entitled
to
depend
upon
the
manufacturer
if
the
local
repair
man
were
a
forehanded
sort
of
a
person
keeping
on
hand
a
good
stock
of
parts
although
on
many
of
the
cars
the
parts
were
not
interchangeable
the
owner
was
lucky
but
if
the
repair
man
were
a
shiftless
person
with
an
adequate
knowledge
of
automobiles
and
an
inordinate
desire
to
make
a
good
thing
out
of
every
car
that
came
into
his
place
for
repairs
then
even
a
slight
breakdown
meant
weeks
of
laying
up
and
a
whopping
big
repair
bill
that
had
to
be
paid
before
the
car
could
be
taken
away
the
repair
men
were
for
a
time
the
largest
menace
to
the
automobile
industry
even
as
late
as
and
the
owner
of
an
automobile
was
regarded
as
essentially
a
rich
man
whose
money
ought
to
be
taken
away
from
him
we
met
that
situation
squarely
and
at
the
very
beginning
we
would
not
have
our
distribution
blocked
by
stupid
greedy
men
that
is
getting
some
years
ahead
of
the
story
but
it
is
control
by
finance
that
breaks
up
service
because
it
looks
to
the
immediate
dollar
if
the
first
consideration
is
to
earn
a
certain
amount
of
money
then
unless
by
some
stroke
of
luck
matters
are
going
especially
well
and
there
is
a
surplus
over
for
service
so
that
the
operating
men
may
have
a
chance
future
business
has
to
be
sacrificed
for
the
dollar
of
and
also
i
noticed
a
tendency
among
many
men
in
business
to
feel
that
their
lot
was
hard
they
worked
against
a
day
when
they
might
retire
and
live
on
an
income
get
out
of
the
strife
life
to
them
was
a
battle
to
be
ended
as
soon
as
possible
that
was
another
point
i
could
not
understand
for
as
i
reasoned
life
is
not
a
battle
except
with
our
own
tendency
to
sag
with
the
downpull
of
getting
settled
if
to
petrify
is
success
all
one
has
to
do
is
to
humour
the
lazy
side
of
the
mind
but
if
to
grow
is
success
then
one
must
wake
up
anew
every
morning
and
keep
awake
all
day
i
saw
great
businesses
become
but
the
ghost
of
a
name
because
someone
thought
they
could
be
managed
just
as
they
were
always
managed
and
though
the
management
may
have
been
most
excellent
in
its
day
its
excellence
consisted
in
its
alertness
to
its
day
and
not
in
slavish
following
of
its
yesterdays
life
as
i
see
it
is
not
a
location
but
a
journey
even
the
man
who
most
feels
himself
settled
is
not
settled
he
is
probably
sagging
back
everything
is
in
flux
and
was
meant
to
be
life
flows
we
may
live
at
the
same
number
of
the
street
but
it
is
never
the
same
man
who
lives
there
and
out
of
the
delusion
that
life
is
a
battle
that
may
be
lost
by
a
false
move
grows
i
have
noticed
a
great
love
for
regularity
men
fall
into
the
habit
seldom
does
the
cobbler
take
up
with
the
way
of
soling
shoes
and
seldom
does
the
artisan
willingly
take
up
with
new
methods
in
his
trade
habit
conduces
to
a
certain
inertia
and
any
disturbance
of
it
affects
the
mind
like
trouble
it
will
be
recalled
that
when
a
study
was
made
of
shop
methods
so
that
the
workmen
might
be
taught
to
produce
with
less
useless
motion
and
fatigue
it
was
most
opposed
by
the
workmen
themselves
though
they
suspected
that
it
was
simply
a
game
to
get
more
out
of
them
what
most
irked
them
was
that
it
interfered
with
the
grooves
in
which
they
had
become
accustomed
to
move
business
men
go
down
with
their
businesses
because
they
like
the
old
way
so
well
they
can
not
bring
themselves
to
change
one
sees
them
all
about
men
who
do
not
know
that
yesterday
is
past
and
who
woke
up
this
morning
with
their
last
year
ideas
it
could
almost
be
written
down
as
a
formula
that
when
a
man
begins
to
think
that
he
has
at
last
found
his
method
he
had
better
begin
a
most
searching
examination
of
himself
to
see
whether
some
part
of
his
brain
has
not
gone
to
sleep
there
is
a
subtle
danger
in
a
man
thinking
that
he
is
fixed
for
life
it
indicates
that
the
next
jolt
of
the
wheel
of
progress
is
going
to
fling
him
off
there
is
also
the
great
fear
of
being
thought
a
fool
so
many
men
are
afraid
of
being
considered
fools
i
grant
that
public
opinion
is
a
powerful
police
influence
for
those
who
need
it
perhaps
it
is
true
that
the
majority
of
men
need
the
restraint
of
public
opinion
public
opinion
may
keep
a
man
better
than
he
would
otherwise
be
if
not
better
morally
at
least
better
as
far
as
his
social
desirability
is
concerned
but
it
is
not
a
bad
thing
to
be
a
fool
for
righteousness
sake
the
best
of
it
is
that
such
fools
usually
live
long
enough
to
prove
that
they
were
not
fools
or
the
work
they
have
begun
lives
long
enough
to
prove
they
were
not
foolish
the
money
influence
the
pressing
to
make
a
profit
on
an
investment
and
its
consequent
neglect
of
or
skimping
of
work
and
hence
of
service
showed
itself
to
me
in
many
ways
it
seemed
to
be
at
the
bottom
of
most
troubles
it
was
the
cause
of
low
wages
for
without
work
high
wages
can
not
be
paid
and
if
the
whole
attention
is
not
given
to
the
work
it
can
not
be
well
directed
most
men
want
to
be
free
to
work
under
the
system
in
use
they
could
not
be
free
to
work
during
my
first
experience
i
was
not
free
i
could
not
give
full
play
to
my
ideas
everything
had
to
be
planned
to
make
money
the
last
consideration
was
the
work
and
the
most
curious
part
of
it
all
was
the
insistence
that
it
was
the
money
and
not
the
work
that
counted
it
did
not
seem
to
strike
any
one
as
illogical
that
money
should
be
put
ahead
of
work
even
though
everyone
had
to
admit
that
the
profit
had
to
come
from
the
work
the
desire
seemed
to
be
to
find
a
short
cut
to
money
and
to
pass
over
the
obvious
short
cut
which
is
through
the
work
take
competition
i
found
that
competition
was
supposed
to
be
a
menace
and
that
a
good
manager
circumvented
his
competitors
by
getting
a
monopoly
through
artificial
means
the
idea
was
that
there
were
only
a
certain
number
of
people
who
could
buy
and
that
it
was
necessary
to
get
their
trade
ahead
of
someone
else
some
will
remember
that
later
many
of
the
automobile
manufacturers
entered
into
an
association
under
the
selden
patent
just
so
that
it
might
be
legally
possible
to
control
the
price
and
the
output
of
automobiles
they
had
the
same
idea
that
so
many
trades
unions
have
the
ridiculous
notion
that
more
profit
can
be
had
doing
less
work
than
more
the
plan
i
believe
is
a
very
antiquated
one
i
could
not
see
then
and
am
still
unable
to
see
that
there
is
not
always
enough
for
the
man
who
does
his
work
time
spent
in
fighting
competition
is
wasted
it
had
better
be
spent
in
doing
the
work
there
are
always
enough
people
ready
and
anxious
to
buy
provided
you
supply
what
they
want
and
at
the
proper
price
and
this
applies
to
personal
services
as
well
as
to
goods
during
this
time
of
reflection
i
was
far
from
idle
we
were
going
ahead
with
a
motor
and
the
building
of
a
pair
of
big
racing
cars
i
had
plenty
of
time
for
i
never
left
my
business
i
do
not
believe
a
man
can
ever
leave
his
business
he
ought
to
think
of
it
by
day
and
dream
of
it
by
night
it
is
nice
to
plan
to
do
one
work
in
office
hours
to
take
up
the
work
in
the
morning
to
drop
it
in
the
evening
and
not
have
a
care
until
the
next
morning
it
is
perfectly
possible
to
do
that
if
one
is
so
constituted
as
to
be
willing
through
all
of
his
life
to
accept
direction
to
be
an
employee
possibly
a
responsible
employee
but
not
a
director
or
manager
of
anything
a
manual
labourer
must
have
a
limit
on
his
hours
otherwise
he
will
wear
himself
out
if
he
intends
to
remain
always
a
manual
labourer
then
he
should
forget
about
his
work
when
the
whistle
blows
but
if
he
intends
to
go
forward
and
do
anything
the
whistle
is
only
a
signal
to
start
thinking
over
the
day
work
in
order
to
discover
how
it
might
be
done
better
the
man
who
has
the
largest
capacity
for
work
and
thought
is
the
man
who
is
bound
to
succeed
i
can
not
pretend
to
say
because
i
do
not
know
whether
the
man
who
works
always
who
never
leaves
his
business
who
is
absolutely
intent
upon
getting
ahead
and
who
therefore
does
get
ahead
is
happier
than
the
man
who
keeps
office
hours
both
for
his
brain
and
his
hands
it
is
not
necessary
for
any
one
to
decide
the
question
a
engine
will
not
pull
as
much
as
a
twenty
the
man
who
keeps
brain
office
hours
limits
his
horsepower
if
he
is
satisfied
to
pull
only
the
load
that
he
has
well
and
good
that
is
his
affair
but
he
must
not
complain
if
another
who
has
increased
his
horsepower
pulls
more
than
he
does
leisure
and
work
bring
different
results
if
a
man
wants
leisure
and
gets
it
then
he
has
no
cause
to
complain
but
he
can
not
have
both
leisure
and
the
results
of
work
concretely
what
i
most
realized
about
business
in
that
year
and
i
have
been
learning
more
each
year
without
finding
it
necessary
to
change
my
first
conclusions
is
this
that
finance
is
given
a
place
ahead
of
work
and
therefore
tends
to
kill
the
work
and
destroy
the
fundamental
of
service
that
thinking
first
of
money
instead
of
work
brings
on
fear
of
failure
and
this
fear
blocks
every
avenue
of
business
it
makes
a
man
afraid
of
competition
of
changing
his
methods
or
of
doing
anything
which
might
change
his
condition
that
the
way
is
clear
for
any
one
who
thinks
first
of
service
of
doing
the
work
in
the
best
possible
way
chapter
iii
starting
the
real
business
in
the
little
brick
shop
at
park
place
i
had
ample
opportunity
to
work
out
the
design
and
some
of
the
methods
of
manufacture
of
a
new
car
even
if
it
were
possible
to
organize
the
exact
kind
of
corporation
that
i
wanted
one
in
which
doing
the
work
well
and
suiting
the
public
would
be
controlling
factors
it
became
apparent
that
i
never
could
produce
a
thoroughly
good
motor
car
that
might
be
sold
at
a
low
price
under
the
existing
manufacturing
methods
everybody
knows
that
it
is
always
possible
to
do
a
thing
better
the
second
time
i
do
not
know
why
manufacturing
should
not
at
that
time
have
generally
recognized
this
as
a
basic
fact
unless
it
might
be
that
the
manufacturers
were
in
such
a
hurry
to
obtain
something
to
sell
that
they
did
not
take
time
for
adequate
preparation
making
to
order
instead
of
making
in
volume
is
i
suppose
a
habit
a
tradition
that
has
descended
from
the
old
handicraft
days
ask
a
hundred
people
how
they
want
a
particular
article
made
about
eighty
will
not
know
they
will
leave
it
to
you
fifteen
will
think
that
they
must
say
something
while
five
will
really
have
preferences
and
reasons
the
made
up
of
those
who
do
not
know
and
admit
it
and
the
fifteen
who
do
not
know
but
do
not
admit
it
constitute
the
real
market
for
any
product
the
five
who
want
something
special
may
or
may
not
be
able
to
pay
the
price
for
special
work
if
they
have
the
price
they
can
get
the
work
but
they
constitute
a
special
and
limited
market
of
the
perhaps
ten
or
fifteen
will
pay
a
price
for
quality
of
those
remaining
a
number
will
buy
solely
on
price
and
without
regard
to
quality
their
numbers
are
thinning
with
each
day
buyers
are
learning
how
to
buy
the
majority
will
consider
quality
and
buy
the
biggest
dollar
worth
of
quality
if
therefore
you
discover
what
will
give
this
per
cent
of
people
the
best
service
and
then
arrange
to
manufacture
at
the
very
highest
quality
and
sell
at
the
very
lowest
price
you
will
be
meeting
a
demand
which
is
so
large
that
it
may
be
called
universal
this
is
not
standardizing
the
use
of
the
word
standardizing
is
very
apt
to
lead
one
into
trouble
for
it
implies
a
certain
freezing
of
design
and
method
and
usually
works
out
so
that
the
manufacturer
selects
whatever
article
he
can
the
most
easily
make
and
sell
at
the
highest
profit
the
public
is
not
considered
either
in
the
design
or
in
the
price
the
thought
behind
most
standardization
is
to
be
able
to
make
a
larger
profit
the
result
is
that
with
the
economies
which
are
inevitable
if
you
make
only
one
thing
a
larger
and
larger
profit
is
continually
being
had
by
the
manufacturer
his
output
also
becomes
larger
his
facilities
produce
more
and
before
he
knows
it
his
markets
are
overflowing
with
goods
which
will
not
sell
these
goods
would
sell
if
the
manufacturer
would
take
a
lower
price
for
them
there
is
always
buying
power
present
but
that
buying
power
will
not
always
respond
to
reductions
in
price
if
an
article
has
been
sold
at
too
high
a
price
and
then
because
of
stagnant
business
the
price
is
suddenly
cut
the
response
is
sometimes
most
disappointing
and
for
a
very
good
reason
the
public
is
wary
it
thinks
that
the
is
a
fake
and
it
sits
around
waiting
for
a
real
cut
we
saw
much
of
that
last
year
if
on
the
contrary
the
economies
of
making
are
transferred
at
once
to
the
price
and
if
it
is
well
known
that
such
is
the
policy
of
the
manufacturer
the
public
will
have
confidence
in
him
and
will
respond
they
will
trust
him
to
give
honest
value
so
standardization
may
seem
bad
business
unless
it
carries
with
it
the
plan
of
constantly
reducing
the
price
at
which
the
article
is
sold
and
the
price
has
to
be
reduced
this
is
very
important
because
of
the
manufacturing
economies
that
have
come
about
and
not
because
the
falling
demand
by
the
public
indicates
that
it
is
not
satisfied
with
the
price
the
public
should
always
be
wondering
how
it
is
possible
to
give
so
much
for
the
money
standardization
to
use
the
word
as
i
understand
it
is
not
just
taking
one
best
selling
article
and
concentrating
on
it
it
is
planning
day
and
night
and
probably
for
years
first
on
something
which
will
best
suit
the
public
and
then
on
how
it
should
be
made
the
exact
processes
of
manufacturing
will
develop
of
themselves
then
if
we
shift
the
manufacturing
from
the
profit
to
the
service
basis
we
shall
have
a
real
business
in
which
the
profits
will
be
all
that
any
one
could
desire
all
of
this
seems
to
me
it
is
the
logical
basis
of
any
business
that
wants
to
serve
per
cent
of
the
community
it
is
the
logical
way
in
which
the
community
can
serve
itself
i
can
not
comprehend
why
all
business
does
not
go
on
this
basis
all
that
has
to
be
done
in
order
to
adopt
it
is
to
overcome
the
habit
of
grabbing
at
the
nearest
dollar
as
though
it
were
the
only
dollar
in
the
world
the
habit
has
already
to
an
extent
been
overcome
all
the
large
and
successful
retail
stores
in
this
country
are
on
the
basis
the
only
further
step
required
is
to
throw
overboard
the
idea
of
pricing
on
what
the
traffic
will
bear
and
instead
go
to
the
basis
of
pricing
on
what
it
costs
to
manufacture
and
then
reducing
the
cost
of
manufacture
if
the
design
of
the
product
has
been
sufficiently
studied
then
changes
in
it
will
come
very
slowly
but
changes
in
manufacturing
processes
will
come
very
rapidly
and
wholly
naturally
that
has
been
our
experience
in
everything
we
have
undertaken
how
naturally
it
has
all
come
about
i
shall
later
outline
the
point
that
i
wish
to
impress
here
is
that
it
is
impossible
to
get
a
product
on
which
one
may
concentrate
unless
an
unlimited
amount
of
study
is
given
beforehand
it
is
not
just
an
afternoon
work
these
ideas
were
forming
with
me
during
this
year
of
experimenting
most
of
the
experimenting
went
into
the
building
of
racing
cars
the
idea
in
those
days
was
that
a
car
ought
to
be
a
racer
i
never
really
thought
much
of
racing
but
following
the
bicycle
idea
the
manufacturers
had
the
notion
that
winning
a
race
on
a
track
told
the
public
something
about
the
merits
of
an
automobile
although
i
can
hardly
imagine
any
test
that
would
tell
less
but
as
the
others
were
doing
it
i
too
had
to
do
it
in
with
tom
cooper
i
built
two
cars
solely
for
speed
they
were
quite
alike
one
we
named
the
and
the
other
the
arrow
if
an
automobile
were
going
to
be
known
for
speed
then
i
was
going
to
make
an
automobile
that
would
be
known
wherever
speed
was
known
these
were
i
put
in
four
great
big
cylinders
giving
which
up
to
that
time
had
been
unheard
of
the
roar
of
those
cylinders
alone
was
enough
to
half
kill
a
man
there
was
only
one
seat
one
life
to
a
car
was
enough
i
tried
out
the
cars
cooper
tried
out
the
cars
we
let
them
out
at
full
speed
i
can
not
quite
describe
the
sensation
going
over
niagara
falls
would
have
been
but
a
pastime
after
a
ride
in
one
of
them
i
did
not
want
to
take
the
responsibility
of
racing
the
which
we
put
up
first
neither
did
cooper
cooper
said
he
knew
a
man
who
lived
on
speed
that
nothing
could
go
too
fast
for
him
he
wired
to
salt
lake
city
and
on
came
a
professional
bicycle
rider
named
barney
oldfield
he
had
never
driven
a
motor
car
but
he
liked
the
idea
of
trying
it
he
said
he
would
try
anything
once
it
took
us
only
a
week
to
teach
him
how
to
drive
the
man
did
not
know
what
fear
was
all
that
he
had
to
learn
was
how
to
control
the
monster
controlling
the
fastest
car
of
was
nothing
as
compared
to
controlling
that
car
the
steering
wheel
had
not
yet
been
thought
of
all
the
previous
cars
that
i
had
built
simply
had
tillers
on
this
one
i
put
a
tiller
for
holding
the
car
in
line
required
all
the
strength
of
a
strong
man
the
race
for
which
we
were
working
was
at
three
miles
on
the
grosse
point
track
we
kept
our
cars
as
a
dark
horse
we
left
the
predictions
to
the
others
the
tracks
then
were
not
scientifically
banked
it
was
not
known
how
much
speed
a
motor
car
could
develop
no
one
knew
better
than
oldfield
what
the
turns
meant
and
as
he
took
his
seat
while
i
was
cranking
the
car
for
the
start
he
remarked
cheerily
well
this
chariot
may
kill
me
but
they
will
say
afterward
that
i
was
going
like
hell
when
she
took
me
over
the
bank
and
he
did
go
he
never
dared
to
look
around
he
did
not
shut
off
on
the
curves
he
simply
let
that
car
go
and
go
it
did
he
was
about
half
a
mile
ahead
of
the
next
man
at
the
end
of
the
race
the
did
what
it
was
intended
to
do
it
advertised
the
fact
that
i
could
build
a
fast
motorcar
a
week
after
the
race
i
formed
the
ford
motor
company
i
was
designer
master
mechanic
superintendent
and
general
manager
the
capitalization
of
the
company
was
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
of
this
i
owned
per
cent
the
total
amount
subscribed
in
cash
was
about
thousand
dollars
which
is
the
only
money
that
the
company
has
ever
received
for
the
capital
fund
from
other
than
operations
in
the
beginning
i
thought
that
it
was
possible
notwithstanding
my
former
experience
to
go
forward
with
a
company
in
which
i
owned
less
than
the
controlling
share
i
very
shortly
found
i
had
to
have
control
and
therefore
in
with
funds
that
i
had
earned
in
the
company
i
bought
enough
stock
to
bring
my
holdings
up
to
per
cent
and
a
little
later
bought
enough
more
to
give
me
per
cent
the
new
equipment
and
the
whole
progress
of
the
company
have
always
been
financed
out
of
earnings
in
my
son
edsel
purchased
the
remaining
per
cent
of
the
stock
because
certain
of
the
minority
stockholders
disagreed
with
my
policies
for
these
shares
he
paid
at
the
rate
of
for
each
par
and
in
all
paid
about
millions
the
original
company
and
its
equipment
as
may
be
gathered
were
not
elaborate
we
rented
strelow
carpenter
shop
on
mack
avenue
in
making
my
designs
i
had
also
worked
out
the
methods
of
making
but
since
at
that
time
we
could
not
afford
to
buy
machinery
the
entire
car
was
made
according
to
my
designs
but
by
various
manufacturers
and
about
all
we
did
even
in
the
way
of
assembling
was
to
put
on
the
wheels
the
tires
and
the
body
that
would
really
be
the
most
economical
method
of
manufacturing
if
only
one
could
be
certain
that
all
of
the
various
parts
would
be
made
on
the
manufacturing
plan
that
i
have
above
outlined
the
most
economical
manufacturing
of
the
future
will
be
that
in
which
the
whole
of
an
article
is
not
made
under
one
roof
unless
of
course
it
be
a
very
simple
article
the
modern
or
better
the
future
method
is
to
have
each
part
made
where
it
may
best
be
made
and
then
assemble
the
parts
into
a
complete
unit
at
the
points
of
consumption
that
is
the
method
we
are
now
following
and
expect
to
extend
it
would
make
no
difference
whether
one
company
or
one
individual
owned
all
the
factories
fabricating
the
component
parts
of
a
single
product
or
whether
such
part
were
made
in
our
independently
owned
factory
only
all
adopted
the
same
service
if
we
can
buy
as
good
a
part
as
we
can
make
ourselves
and
the
supply
is
ample
and
the
price
right
we
do
not
attempt
to
make
it
ourselves
or
at
any
rate
to
make
more
than
an
emergency
supply
in
fact
it
might
be
better
to
have
the
ownership
widely
scattered
i
had
been
experimenting
principally
upon
the
cutting
down
of
weight
excess
weight
kills
any
vehicle
there
are
a
lot
of
fool
ideas
about
weight
it
is
queer
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
how
some
fool
terms
get
into
current
use
there
is
the
phrase
heavyweight
as
applied
to
a
man
mental
apparatus
what
does
it
mean
no
one
wants
to
be
fat
and
heavy
of
body
then
why
of
head
for
some
clumsy
reason
we
have
come
to
confuse
strength
with
weight
the
crude
methods
of
early
building
undoubtedly
had
much
to
do
with
this
the
old
weighed
a
ton
and
it
had
so
much
weight
that
it
was
weak
to
carry
a
few
tons
of
humanity
from
new
york
to
chicago
the
railroad
builds
a
train
that
weighs
many
hundred
tons
and
the
result
is
an
absolute
loss
of
real
strength
and
the
extravagant
waste
of
untold
millions
in
the
form
of
power
the
law
of
diminishing
returns
begins
to
operate
at
the
point
where
strength
becomes
weight
weight
may
be
desirable
in
a
steam
roller
but
nowhere
else
strength
has
nothing
to
do
with
weight
the
mentality
of
the
man
who
does
things
in
the
world
is
agile
light
and
strong
the
most
beautiful
things
in
the
world
are
those
from
which
all
excess
weight
has
been
eliminated
strength
is
never
just
weight
either
in
men
or
things
whenever
any
one
suggests
to
me
that
i
might
increase
weight
or
add
a
part
i
look
into
decreasing
weight
and
eliminating
a
part
the
car
that
i
designed
was
lighter
than
any
car
that
had
yet
been
made
it
would
have
been
lighter
if
i
had
known
how
to
make
it
so
later
i
got
the
materials
to
make
the
lighter
car
in
our
first
year
we
built
model
a
selling
the
runabout
for
eight
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
and
the
tonneau
for
one
hundred
dollars
more
this
model
had
a
opposed
motor
developing
eight
horsepower
it
had
a
chain
drive
a
inch
wheel
base
which
was
supposed
to
be
long
and
a
fuel
capacity
of
five
gallons
we
made
and
sold
cars
in
the
first
year
that
is
how
well
the
public
responded
every
one
of
these
model
a
has
a
history
take
no
colonel
collier
of
california
bought
it
in
he
used
it
for
a
couple
of
years
sold
it
and
bought
a
new
ford
no
changed
hands
frequently
until
when
it
was
bought
by
one
edmund
jacobs
living
near
ramona
in
the
heart
of
the
mountains
he
drove
it
for
several
years
in
the
roughest
kind
of
work
then
he
bought
a
new
ford
and
sold
his
old
one
by
no
had
passed
into
the
hands
of
a
man
named
cantello
who
took
out
the
motor
hitched
it
to
a
water
pump
rigged
up
shafts
on
the
chassis
and
now
while
the
motor
chugs
away
at
the
pumping
of
water
the
chassis
drawn
by
a
burro
acts
as
a
buggy
the
moral
of
course
is
that
you
can
dissect
a
ford
but
you
can
not
kill
it
in
our
first
advertisement
we
said
our
purpose
is
to
construct
and
market
an
automobile
specially
designed
for
everyday
wear
and
tear
business
professional
and
family
use
an
automobile
which
will
attain
to
a
sufficient
speed
to
satisfy
the
average
person
without
acquiring
any
of
those
breakneck
velocities
which
are
so
universally
condemned
a
machine
which
will
be
admired
by
man
woman
and
child
alike
for
its
compactness
its
simplicity
its
safety
its
convenience
and
last
but
not
least
its
exceedingly
reasonable
price
which
places
it
within
the
reach
of
many
thousands
who
could
not
think
of
paying
the
comparatively
fabulous
prices
asked
for
most
machines
and
these
are
the
points
we
emphasized
good
material
simplicity
most
of
the
cars
at
that
time
required
considerable
skill
in
their
management
the
engine
the
ignition
which
was
furnished
by
two
sets
of
six
dry
cell
batteries
the
automatic
oiling
the
simplicity
and
the
ease
of
control
of
the
transmission
which
was
of
the
planetary
type
the
workmanship
we
did
not
make
the
pleasure
appeal
we
never
have
in
its
first
advertising
we
showed
that
a
motor
car
was
a
utility
we
said
we
often
hear
quoted
the
old
proverb
time
is
money
and
yet
how
few
business
and
professional
men
act
as
if
they
really
believed
its
truth
men
who
are
constantly
complaining
of
shortage
of
time
and
lamenting
the
fewness
of
days
in
the
week
men
to
whom
every
five
minutes
wasted
means
a
dollar
thrown
away
men
to
whom
five
minutes
delay
sometimes
means
the
loss
of
many
dollars
will
yet
depend
on
the
haphazard
uncomfortable
and
limited
means
of
transportation
afforded
by
street
cars
when
the
investment
of
an
exceedingly
moderate
sum
in
the
purchase
of
a
perfected
efficient
automobile
would
cut
out
anxiety
and
unpunctuality
and
provide
a
luxurious
means
of
travel
ever
at
your
beck
and
call
always
ready
always
sure
built
to
save
you
time
and
consequent
money
built
to
take
you
anywhere
you
want
to
go
and
bring
you
back
again
on
time
built
to
add
to
your
reputation
for
punctuality
to
keep
your
customers
and
in
a
buying
mood
built
for
business
or
pleasure
just
as
you
say
built
also
for
the
good
of
your
health
to
carry
you
jarlessly
over
any
kind
of
half
decent
roads
to
refresh
your
brain
with
the
luxury
of
much
and
your
lungs
with
the
tonic
of
tonics
the
right
kind
of
atmosphere
it
is
your
say
too
when
it
comes
to
speed
you
can
if
you
choose
loiter
lingeringly
through
shady
avenues
or
you
can
press
down
on
the
until
all
the
scenery
looks
alike
to
you
and
you
have
to
keep
your
eyes
skinned
to
count
the
milestones
as
they
pass
i
am
giving
the
gist
of
this
advertisement
to
show
that
from
the
beginning
we
were
looking
to
providing
service
we
never
bothered
with
a
sporting
car
the
business
went
along
almost
as
by
magic
the
cars
gained
a
reputation
for
standing
up
they
were
tough
they
were
simple
and
they
were
well
made
i
was
working
on
my
design
for
a
universal
single
model
but
i
had
not
settled
the
designs
nor
had
we
the
money
to
build
and
equip
the
proper
kind
of
plant
for
manufacturing
i
had
not
the
money
to
discover
the
very
best
and
lightest
materials
we
still
had
to
accept
the
materials
that
the
market
offered
we
got
the
best
to
be
had
but
we
had
no
facilities
for
the
scientific
investigation
of
materials
or
for
original
research
my
associates
were
not
convinced
that
it
was
possible
to
restrict
our
cars
to
a
single
model
the
automobile
trade
was
following
the
old
bicycle
trade
in
which
every
manufacturer
thought
it
necessary
to
bring
out
a
new
model
each
year
and
to
make
it
so
unlike
all
previous
models
that
those
who
had
bought
the
former
models
would
want
to
get
rid
of
the
old
and
buy
the
new
that
was
supposed
to
be
good
business
it
is
the
same
idea
that
women
submit
to
in
their
clothing
and
hats
that
is
not
service
it
seeks
only
to
provide
something
new
not
something
better
it
is
extraordinary
how
firmly
rooted
is
the
notion
that
business
continuous
selling
depends
not
on
satisfying
the
customer
once
and
for
all
but
on
first
getting
his
money
for
one
article
and
then
persuading
him
he
ought
to
buy
a
new
and
different
one
the
plan
which
i
then
had
in
the
back
of
my
head
but
to
which
we
were
not
then
sufficiently
advanced
to
give
expression
was
that
when
a
model
was
settled
upon
then
every
improvement
on
that
model
should
be
interchangeable
with
the
old
model
so
that
a
car
should
never
get
out
of
date
it
is
my
ambition
to
have
every
piece
of
machinery
or
other
product
that
i
turn
out
so
strong
and
so
well
made
that
no
one
ought
ever
to
have
to
buy
a
second
one
a
good
machine
of
any
kind
ought
to
last
as
long
as
a
good
watch
in
the
second
year
we
scattered
our
energies
among
three
models
we
made
a
touring
car
model
b
which
sold
for
two
thousand
dollars
model
c
which
was
a
slightly
improved
model
a
and
sold
at
fifty
dollars
more
than
the
former
price
and
model
f
a
touring
car
which
sold
for
a
thousand
dollars
that
is
we
scattered
our
energy
and
increased
prices
and
therefore
we
sold
fewer
cars
than
in
the
first
year
the
sales
were
cars
that
model
b
the
first
car
for
general
road
use
had
to
be
advertised
winning
a
race
or
making
a
record
was
then
the
best
kind
of
advertising
so
i
fixed
up
the
arrow
the
twin
of
the
old
in
fact
practically
remade
it
and
a
week
before
the
new
york
automobile
show
i
drove
it
myself
over
a
surveyed
mile
straightaway
on
the
ice
i
shall
never
forget
that
race
the
ice
seemed
smooth
enough
so
smooth
that
if
i
had
called
off
the
trial
we
should
have
secured
an
immense
amount
of
the
wrong
kind
of
advertising
but
instead
of
being
smooth
that
ice
was
seamed
with
fissures
which
i
knew
were
going
to
mean
trouble
the
moment
i
got
up
speed
but
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
go
through
with
the
trial
and
i
let
the
old
arrow
out
at
every
fissure
the
car
leaped
into
the
air
i
never
knew
how
it
was
coming
down
when
i
was
in
the
air
i
was
skidding
but
somehow
i
stayed
top
side
up
and
on
the
course
making
a
record
that
went
all
over
the
world
that
put
model
b
on
the
map
but
not
enough
on
to
overcome
the
price
advances
no
stunt
and
no
advertising
will
sell
an
article
for
any
length
of
time
business
is
not
a
game
the
moral
is
coming
our
little
wooden
shop
had
with
the
business
we
were
doing
become
totally
inadequate
and
in
we
took
out
of
our
working
capital
sufficient
funds
to
build
a
plant
at
the
corner
of
piquette
and
beaubien
streets
which
for
the
first
time
gave
us
real
manufacturing
facilities
we
began
to
make
and
to
assemble
quite
a
number
of
the
parts
although
still
we
were
principally
an
assembling
shop
in
we
made
only
two
models
one
the
car
at
and
another
touring
car
at
both
being
the
models
of
the
previous
year
and
our
sales
dropped
to
cars
some
said
it
was
because
we
had
not
brought
out
new
models
i
thought
it
was
because
our
cars
were
too
expensive
they
did
not
appeal
to
the
per
cent
i
changed
the
policy
in
the
next
year
having
first
acquired
stock
control
for
we
entirely
left
off
making
touring
cars
and
made
three
models
of
runabouts
and
roadsters
none
of
which
differed
materially
from
the
other
in
manufacturing
process
or
in
component
parts
but
were
somewhat
different
in
appearance
the
big
thing
was
that
the
cheapest
car
sold
for
and
the
most
expensive
for
only
and
right
there
came
the
complete
demonstration
of
what
price
meant
we
sold
cars
nearly
five
times
as
many
as
in
our
biggest
previous
year
our
banner
week
was
that
of
may
when
we
assembled
cars
in
six
working
days
it
almost
swamped
our
facilities
the
foreman
had
a
tallyboard
on
which
he
chalked
up
each
car
as
it
was
finished
and
turned
over
to
the
testers
the
tallyboard
was
hardly
equal
to
the
task
on
one
day
in
the
following
june
we
assembled
an
even
one
hundred
cars
in
the
next
year
we
departed
from
the
programme
that
had
been
so
successful
and
i
designed
a
big
car
fifty
horsepower
six
cylinder
that
would
burn
up
the
roads
we
continued
making
our
small
cars
but
the
panic
and
the
diversion
to
the
more
expensive
model
cut
down
the
sales
to
cars
we
had
been
through
an
experimenting
period
of
five
years
the
cars
were
beginning
to
be
sold
in
europe
the
business
as
an
automobile
business
then
went
was
considered
extraordinarily
prosperous
we
had
plenty
of
money
since
the
first
year
we
have
practically
always
had
plenty
of
money
we
sold
for
cash
we
did
not
borrow
money
and
we
sold
directly
to
the
purchaser
we
had
no
bad
debts
and
we
kept
within
ourselves
on
every
move
i
have
always
kept
well
within
my
resources
i
have
never
found
it
necessary
to
strain
them
because
inevitably
if
you
give
attention
to
work
and
service
the
resources
will
increase
more
rapidly
than
you
can
devise
ways
and
means
of
disposing
of
them
we
were
careful
in
the
selection
of
our
salesmen
at
first
there
was
great
difficulty
in
getting
good
salesmen
because
the
automobile
trade
was
not
supposed
to
be
stable
it
was
supposed
to
be
dealing
in
a
luxury
in
pleasure
vehicles
we
eventually
appointed
agents
selecting
the
very
best
men
we
could
find
and
then
paying
to
them
a
salary
larger
than
they
could
possibly
earn
in
business
for
themselves
in
the
beginning
we
had
not
paid
much
in
the
way
of
salaries
we
were
feeling
our
way
but
when
we
knew
what
our
way
was
we
adopted
the
policy
of
paying
the
very
highest
reward
for
service
and
then
insisting
upon
getting
the
highest
service
among
the
requirements
for
an
agent
we
laid
down
the
following
a
progressive
man
keenly
alive
to
the
possibilities
of
business
a
suitable
place
of
business
clean
and
dignified
in
appearance
a
stock
of
parts
sufficient
to
make
prompt
replacements
and
keep
in
active
service
every
ford
car
in
his
territory
an
adequately
equipped
repair
shop
which
has
in
it
the
right
machinery
for
every
necessary
repair
and
adjustment
mechanics
who
are
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
construction
and
operation
of
ford
cars
a
comprehensive
bookkeeping
system
and
a
sales
system
so
that
it
may
be
instantly
apparent
what
is
the
financial
status
of
the
various
departments
of
his
business
the
condition
and
size
of
his
stock
the
present
owners
of
cars
and
the
future
prospects
absolute
cleanliness
throughout
every
department
there
must
be
no
unwashed
windows
dusty
furniture
dirty
floors
a
suitable
display
sign
the
adoption
of
policies
which
will
ensure
absolutely
square
dealing
and
the
highest
character
of
business
ethics
and
this
is
the
general
instruction
that
was
issued
a
dealer
or
a
salesman
ought
to
have
the
name
of
every
possible
automobile
buyer
in
his
territory
including
all
those
who
have
never
given
the
matter
a
thought
he
should
then
personally
solicit
by
visitation
if
possible
by
correspondence
at
the
least
every
man
on
that
list
and
then
making
necessary
memoranda
know
the
automobile
situation
as
related
to
every
resident
so
solicited
if
your
territory
is
too
large
to
permit
this
you
have
too
much
territory
the
way
was
not
easy
we
were
harried
by
a
big
suit
brought
against
the
company
to
try
to
force
us
into
line
with
an
association
of
automobile
manufacturers
who
were
operating
under
the
false
principle
that
there
was
only
a
limited
market
for
automobiles
and
that
a
monopoly
of
that
market
was
essential
this
was
the
famous
selden
patent
suit
at
times
the
support
of
our
defense
severely
strained
our
resources
selden
who
has
but
recently
died
had
little
to
do
with
the
suit
it
was
the
association
which
sought
a
monopoly
under
the
patent
the
situation
was
this
george
selden
a
patent
attorney
filed
an
application
as
far
back
as
for
a
patent
the
object
of
which
was
stated
to
be
the
production
of
a
safe
simple
and
cheap
road
locomotive
light
in
weight
easy
to
control
possessed
of
sufficient
power
to
overcome
an
ordinary
inclination
this
application
was
kept
alive
in
the
patent
office
by
methods
which
are
perfectly
legal
until
when
the
patent
was
granted
in
when
the
application
was
filed
the
automobile
was
practically
unknown
to
the
general
public
but
by
the
time
the
patent
was
issued
everybody
was
familiar
with
vehicles
and
most
of
the
men
including
myself
who
had
been
for
years
working
on
motor
propulsion
were
surprised
to
learn
that
what
we
had
made
practicable
was
covered
by
an
application
of
years
before
although
the
applicant
had
kept
his
idea
merely
as
an
idea
he
had
done
nothing
to
put
it
into
practice
the
specific
claims
under
the
patent
were
divided
into
six
groups
and
i
think
that
not
a
single
one
of
them
was
a
really
new
idea
even
in
when
the
application
was
filed
the
patent
office
allowed
a
combination
and
issued
a
combination
patent
deciding
that
the
combination
a
of
a
carriage
with
its
body
machinery
and
steering
wheel
with
the
b
propelling
mechanism
clutch
and
gear
and
finally
c
the
engine
made
a
valid
patent
with
all
of
that
we
were
not
concerned
i
believed
that
my
engine
had
nothing
whatsoever
in
common
with
what
selden
had
in
mind
the
powerful
combination
of
manufacturers
who
called
themselves
the
licensed
manufacturers
because
they
operated
under
licenses
from
the
patentee
brought
suit
against
us
as
soon
as
we
began
to
be
a
factor
in
motor
production
the
suit
dragged
on
it
was
intended
to
scare
us
out
of
business
we
took
volumes
of
testimony
and
the
blow
came
on
september
when
judge
hough
rendered
an
opinion
in
the
united
states
district
court
finding
against
us
immediately
that
licensed
association
began
to
advertise
warning
prospective
purchasers
against
our
cars
they
had
done
the
same
thing
in
at
the
start
of
the
suit
when
it
was
thought
that
we
could
be
put
out
of
business
i
had
implicit
confidence
that
eventually
we
should
win
our
suit
i
simply
knew
that
we
were
right
but
it
was
a
considerable
blow
to
get
the
first
decision
against
us
for
we
believed
that
many
buyers
even
though
no
injunction
was
issued
against
us
would
be
frightened
away
from
buying
because
of
the
threats
of
court
action
against
individual
owners
the
idea
was
spread
that
if
the
suit
finally
went
against
me
every
man
who
owned
a
ford
car
would
be
prosecuted
some
of
my
more
enthusiastic
opponents
i
understand
gave
it
out
privately
that
there
would
be
criminal
as
well
as
civil
suits
and
that
a
man
buying
a
ford
car
might
as
well
be
buying
a
ticket
to
jail
we
answered
with
an
advertisement
for
which
we
took
four
pages
in
the
principal
newspapers
all
over
the
country
we
set
out
our
case
we
set
out
our
confidence
in
victory
and
in
conclusion
said
in
conclusion
we
beg
to
state
if
there
are
any
prospective
automobile
buyers
who
are
at
all
intimidated
by
the
claims
made
by
our
adversaries
that
we
will
give
them
in
addition
to
the
protection
of
the
ford
motor
company
with
its
some
of
assets
an
individual
bond
backed
by
a
company
of
more
than
more
of
assets
so
that
each
and
every
individual
owner
of
a
ford
car
will
be
protected
until
at
least
of
assets
have
been
wiped
out
by
those
who
desire
to
control
and
monopolize
this
wonderful
industry
the
bond
is
yours
for
the
asking
so
do
not
allow
yourself
to
be
sold
inferior
cars
at
extravagant
prices
because
of
any
statement
made
by
this
divine
body
n
this
fight
is
not
being
waged
by
the
ford
motor
company
without
the
advice
and
counsel
of
the
ablest
patent
attorneys
of
the
east
and
west
we
thought
that
the
bond
would
give
assurance
to
the
buyers
that
they
needed
confidence
they
did
not
we
sold
more
than
eighteen
thousand
cars
nearly
double
the
output
of
the
previous
year
and
i
think
about
fifty
buyers
asked
for
bonds
perhaps
it
was
less
than
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
probably
nothing
so
well
advertised
the
ford
car
and
the
ford
motor
company
as
did
this
suit
it
appeared
that
we
were
the
under
dog
and
we
had
the
public
sympathy
the
association
had
seventy
million
dollars
we
at
the
beginning
had
not
half
that
number
of
thousands
i
never
had
a
doubt
as
to
the
outcome
but
nevertheless
it
was
a
sword
hanging
over
our
heads
that
we
could
as
well
do
without
prosecuting
that
suit
was
probably
one
of
the
most
shortsighted
acts
that
any
group
of
american
business
men
has
ever
combined
to
commit
taken
in
all
its
sidelights
it
forms
the
best
possible
example
of
joining
unwittingly
to
kill
a
trade
i
regard
it
as
most
fortunate
for
the
automobile
makers
of
the
country
that
we
eventually
won
and
the
association
ceased
to
be
a
serious
factor
in
the
business
by
however
in
spite
of
this
suit
we
had
come
to
a
point
where
it
was
possible
to
announce
and
put
into
fabrication
the
kind
of
car
that
i
wanted
to
build
chapter
iv
the
secret
of
manufacturing
and
serving
now
i
am
not
outlining
the
career
of
the
ford
motor
company
for
any
personal
reason
i
am
not
saying
go
thou
and
do
likewise
what
i
am
trying
to
emphasize
is
that
the
ordinary
way
of
doing
business
is
not
the
best
way
i
am
coming
to
the
point
of
my
entire
departure
from
the
ordinary
methods
from
this
point
dates
the
extraordinary
success
of
the
company
we
had
been
fairly
following
the
custom
of
the
trade
our
automobile
was
less
complex
than
any
other
we
had
no
outside
money
in
the
concern
but
aside
from
these
two
points
we
did
not
differ
materially
from
the
other
automobile
companies
excepting
that
we
had
been
somewhat
more
successful
and
had
rigidly
pursued
the
policy
of
taking
all
cash
discounts
putting
our
profits
back
into
the
business
and
maintaining
a
large
cash
balance
we
entered
cars
in
all
of
the
races
we
advertised
and
we
pushed
our
sales
outside
of
the
simplicity
of
the
construction
of
the
car
our
main
difference
in
design
was
that
we
made
no
provision
for
the
purely
pleasure
car
we
were
just
as
much
a
pleasure
car
as
any
other
car
on
the
market
but
we
gave
no
attention
to
purely
luxury
features
we
would
do
special
work
for
a
buyer
and
i
suppose
that
we
would
have
made
a
special
car
at
a
price
we
were
a
prosperous
company
we
might
easily
have
sat
down
and
said
now
we
have
arrived
let
us
hold
what
we
have
got
indeed
there
was
some
disposition
to
take
this
stand
some
of
the
stockholders
were
seriously
alarmed
when
our
production
reached
one
hundred
cars
a
day
they
wanted
to
do
something
to
stop
me
from
ruining
the
company
and
when
i
replied
to
the
effect
that
one
hundred
cars
a
day
was
only
a
trifle
and
that
i
hoped
before
long
to
make
a
thousand
a
day
they
were
inexpressibly
shocked
and
i
understand
seriously
contemplated
court
action
if
i
had
followed
the
general
opinion
of
my
associates
i
should
have
kept
the
business
about
as
it
was
put
our
funds
into
a
fine
administration
building
tried
to
make
bargains
with
such
competitors
as
seemed
too
active
made
new
designs
from
time
to
time
to
catch
the
fancy
of
the
public
and
generally
have
passed
on
into
the
position
of
a
quiet
respectable
citizen
with
a
quiet
respectable
business
the
temptation
to
stop
and
hang
on
to
what
one
has
is
quite
natural
i
can
entirely
sympathize
with
the
desire
to
quit
a
life
of
activity
and
retire
to
a
life
of
ease
i
have
never
felt
the
urge
myself
but
i
can
comprehend
what
it
is
although
i
think
that
a
man
who
retires
ought
entirely
to
get
out
of
a
business
there
is
a
disposition
to
retire
and
retain
control
it
was
however
no
part
of
my
plan
to
do
anything
of
that
sort
i
regarded
our
progress
merely
as
an
invitation
to
do
more
as
an
indication
that
we
had
reached
a
place
where
we
might
begin
to
perform
a
real
service
i
had
been
planning
every
day
through
these
years
toward
a
universal
car
the
public
had
given
its
reactions
to
the
various
models
the
cars
in
service
the
racing
and
the
road
tests
gave
excellent
guides
as
to
the
changes
that
ought
to
be
made
and
even
by
i
had
fairly
in
mind
the
specifications
of
the
kind
of
car
i
wanted
to
build
but
i
lacked
the
material
to
give
strength
without
weight
i
came
across
that
material
almost
by
accident
in
i
was
at
a
motor
race
at
palm
beach
there
was
a
big
and
a
french
car
was
wrecked
we
had
entered
our
model
k
the
six
i
thought
the
foreign
cars
had
smaller
and
better
parts
than
we
knew
anything
about
after
the
wreck
i
picked
up
a
little
valve
strip
stem
it
was
very
light
and
very
strong
i
asked
what
it
was
made
of
nobody
knew
i
gave
the
stem
to
my
assistant
find
out
all
about
this
i
told
him
that
is
the
kind
of
material
we
ought
to
have
in
our
cars
he
found
eventually
that
it
was
a
french
steel
and
that
there
was
vanadium
in
it
we
tried
every
steel
maker
in
america
not
one
could
make
vanadium
steel
i
sent
to
england
for
a
man
who
understood
how
to
make
the
steel
commercially
the
next
thing
was
to
get
a
plant
to
turn
it
out
that
was
another
problem
vanadium
requires
degrees
fahrenheit
the
ordinary
furnace
could
not
go
beyond
degrees
i
found
a
small
steel
company
in
canton
ohio
i
offered
to
guarantee
them
against
loss
if
they
would
run
a
heat
for
us
they
agreed
the
first
heat
was
a
failure
very
little
vanadium
remained
in
the
steel
i
had
them
try
again
and
the
second
time
the
steel
came
through
until
then
we
had
been
forced
to
be
satisfied
with
steel
running
between
and
pounds
tensile
strength
with
vanadium
the
strength
went
up
to
pounds
having
vanadium
in
hand
i
pulled
apart
our
models
and
tested
in
detail
to
determine
what
kind
of
steel
was
best
for
every
part
whether
we
wanted
a
hard
steel
a
tough
steel
or
an
elastic
steel
we
for
the
first
time
i
think
in
the
history
of
any
large
construction
determined
scientifically
the
exact
quality
of
the
steel
as
a
result
we
then
selected
twenty
different
types
of
steel
for
the
various
steel
parts
about
ten
of
these
were
vanadium
vanadium
was
used
wherever
strength
and
lightness
were
required
of
course
they
are
not
all
the
same
kind
of
vanadium
steel
the
other
elements
vary
according
to
whether
the
part
is
to
stand
hard
wear
or
whether
it
needs
spring
in
short
according
to
what
it
needs
before
these
experiments
i
believe
that
not
more
than
four
different
grades
of
steel
had
ever
been
used
in
automobile
construction
by
further
experimenting
especially
in
the
direction
of
heat
treating
we
have
been
able
still
further
to
increase
the
strength
of
the
steel
and
therefore
to
reduce
the
weight
of
the
car
in
the
french
department
of
commerce
and
industry
took
one
of
our
steering
spindle
connecting
rod
yokes
selecting
it
as
a
vital
unit
and
tried
it
against
a
similar
part
from
what
they
considered
the
best
french
car
and
in
every
test
our
steel
proved
the
stronger
the
vanadium
steel
disposed
of
much
of
the
weight
the
other
requisites
of
a
universal
car
i
had
already
worked
out
and
many
of
them
were
in
practice
the
design
had
to
balance
men
die
because
a
part
gives
out
machines
wreck
themselves
because
some
parts
are
weaker
than
others
therefore
a
part
of
the
problem
in
designing
a
universal
car
was
to
have
as
nearly
as
possible
all
parts
of
equal
strength
considering
their
purpose
to
put
a
motor
in
a
shay
also
it
had
to
be
fool
proof
this
was
difficult
because
a
gasoline
motor
is
essentially
a
delicate
instrument
and
there
is
a
wonderful
opportunity
for
any
one
who
has
a
mind
that
way
to
mess
it
up
i
adopted
this
slogan
when
one
of
my
cars
breaks
down
i
know
i
am
to
blame
from
the
day
the
first
motor
car
appeared
on
the
streets
it
had
to
me
appeared
to
be
a
necessity
it
was
this
knowledge
and
assurance
that
led
me
to
build
to
the
one
end
a
car
that
would
meet
the
wants
of
the
multitudes
all
my
efforts
were
then
and
still
are
turned
to
the
production
of
one
car
one
model
and
year
following
year
the
pressure
was
and
still
is
to
improve
and
refine
and
make
better
with
an
increasing
reduction
in
price
the
universal
car
had
to
have
these
attributes
quality
in
material
to
give
service
in
use
vanadium
steel
is
the
strongest
toughest
and
most
lasting
of
steels
it
forms
the
foundation
and
of
the
cars
it
is
the
highest
quality
steel
in
this
respect
in
the
world
regardless
of
price
simplicity
in
operation
because
the
masses
are
not
mechanics
power
in
sufficient
quantity
absolute
reliability
because
of
the
varied
uses
to
which
the
cars
would
be
put
and
the
variety
of
roads
over
which
they
would
travel
lightness
with
the
ford
there
are
only
pounds
to
be
carried
by
each
cubic
inch
of
piston
displacement
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
ford
cars
are
always
going
wherever
and
whenever
you
see
them
through
sand
and
mud
through
slush
snow
and
water
up
hills
across
fields
and
roadless
plains
control
to
hold
its
speed
always
in
hand
calmly
and
safely
meeting
every
emergency
and
contingency
either
in
the
crowded
streets
of
the
city
or
on
dangerous
roads
the
planetary
transmission
of
the
ford
gave
this
control
and
anybody
could
work
it
that
is
the
why
of
the
saying
anybody
can
drive
a
ford
it
can
turn
around
almost
anywhere
the
more
a
motor
car
weighs
naturally
the
more
fuel
and
lubricants
are
used
in
the
driving
the
lighter
the
weight
the
lighter
the
expense
of
operation
the
light
weight
of
the
ford
car
in
its
early
years
was
used
as
an
argument
against
it
now
that
is
all
changed
the
design
which
i
settled
upon
was
called
model
the
important
feature
of
the
new
model
which
if
it
were
accepted
as
i
thought
it
would
be
i
intended
to
make
the
only
model
and
then
start
into
real
production
was
its
simplicity
there
were
but
four
constructional
units
in
the
car
the
power
plant
the
frame
the
front
axle
and
the
rear
axle
all
of
these
were
easily
accessible
and
they
were
designed
so
that
no
special
skill
would
be
required
for
their
repair
or
replacement
i
believed
then
although
i
said
very
little
about
it
because
of
the
novelty
of
the
idea
that
it
ought
to
be
possible
to
have
parts
so
simple
and
so
inexpensive
that
the
menace
of
expensive
hand
repair
work
would
be
entirely
eliminated
the
parts
could
be
made
so
cheaply
that
it
would
be
less
expensive
to
buy
new
ones
than
to
have
old
ones
repaired
they
could
be
carried
in
hardware
shops
just
as
nails
or
bolts
are
carried
i
thought
that
it
was
up
to
me
as
the
designer
to
make
the
car
so
completely
simple
that
no
one
could
fail
to
understand
it
that
works
both
ways
and
applies
to
everything
the
less
complex
an
article
the
easier
it
is
to
make
the
cheaper
it
may
be
sold
and
therefore
the
greater
number
may
be
sold
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
into
the
technical
details
of
the
construction
but
perhaps
this
is
as
good
a
place
as
any
to
review
the
various
models
because
model
t
was
the
last
of
the
models
and
the
policy
which
it
brought
about
took
this
business
out
of
the
ordinary
line
of
business
application
of
the
same
idea
would
take
any
business
out
of
the
ordinary
run

the

practically

which
were
not
contained
in
some
one

the
previous
models
every
detail
had
been
fully
tested
in
practice
there
was
no
guessing
as
to
whether
or
not
it
would
be
a
successful
model
it
had
to
be
there
was
no
way
it
could
escape
being
so
for
it
had
not
been
made
in
a
day
it
contained
all
that
i
was
then
able
to
put
into
a
motor
car
plus
the
material
which
for
the
first
time
i
was
able
to
obtain
we
put
out
model
t
for
the
season
the
company
was
then
five
years
old
the
original
factory
space
had
been
acre
we
had
employed
an
average
of
people
in
the
first
year
built
cars
and
had
one
branch
house
in
the
factory
space
had
increased
to
acres
and
we
owned
the
building
the
average
number
of
employees
had
increased
to
we
built
cars
and
had
fourteen
branch
houses
it
was
a
prosperous
business
during
the
season
we
continued
to
make
models
r
and
s
runabouts
and
roadsters
the
models
that
had
previously
been
so
successful
and
which
sold
at
and
but
model
t
swept
them
right
out
we
sold
cars
a
larger
number
than
any
manufacturer
had
ever
sold
the
price
for
the
touring
car
was
on
the
same
chassis
we
mounted
a
town
car
at
a
roadster
at
a
coupe
at
and
a
landaulet
at
this
season
demonstrated
conclusively
to
me
that
it
was
time
to
put
the
new
policy
in
force
the
salesmen
before
i
had
announced
the
policy
were
spurred
by
the
great
sales
to
think
that
even
greater
sales
might
be
had
if
only
we
had
more
models
it
is
strange
how
just
as
soon
as
an
article
becomes
successful
somebody
starts
to
think
that
it
would
be
more
successful
if
only
it
were
different
there
is
a
tendency
to
keep
monkeying
with
styles
and
to
spoil
a
good
thing
by
changing
it
the
salesmen
were
insistent
on
increasing
the
line
they
listened
to
the
per
the
special
customers
who
could
say
what
they
wanted
and
forgot
all
about
the
per
cent
who
just
bought
without
making
any
fuss
no
business
can
improve
unless
it
pays
the
closest
possible
attention
to
complaints
and
suggestions
if
there
is
any
defect
in
service
then
that
must
be
instantly
and
rigorously
investigated
but
when
the
suggestion
is
only
as
to
style
one
has
to
make
sure
whether
it
is
not
merely
a
personal
whim
that
is
being
voiced
salesmen
always
want
to
cater
to
whims
instead
of
acquiring
sufficient
knowledge
of
their
product
to
be
able
to
explain
to
the
customer
with
the
whim
that
what
they
have
will
satisfy
his
every
requirement
that
is
of
course
provided
what
they
have
does
satisfy
these
requirements
therefore
in
i
announced
one
morning
without
any
previous
warning
that
in
the
future
we
were
going
to
build
only
one
model
that
the
model
was
going
to
be
model
t
and
that
the
chassis
would
be
exactly
the
same
for
all
cars
and
i
remarked
any
customer
can
have
a
car
painted
any
colour
that
he
wants
so
long
as
it
is
black
i
can
not
say
that
any
one
agreed
with
me
the
selling
people
could
not
of
course
see
the
advantages
that
a
single
model
would
bring
about
in
production
more
than
that
they
did
not
particularly
care
they
thought
that
our
production
was
good
enough
as
it
was
and
there
was
a
very
decided
opinion
that
lowering
the
sales
price
would
hurt
sales
that
the
people
who
wanted
quality
would
be
driven
away
and
that
there
would
be
none
to
replace
them
there
was
very
little
conception
of
the
motor
industry
a
motor
car
was
still
regarded
as
something
in
the
way
of
a
luxury
the
manufacturers
did
a
good
deal
to
spread
this
idea
some
clever
persons
invented
the
name
pleasure
car
and
the
advertising
emphasized
the
pleasure
features
the
sales
people
had
ground
for
their
objections
and
particularly
when
i
made
the
following
announcement
i
will
build
a
motor
car
for
the
great
multitude
it
will
be
large
enough
for
the
family
but
small
enough
for
the
individual
to
run
and
care
for
it
will
be
constructed
of
the
best
materials
by
the
best
men
to
be
hired
after
the
simplest
designs
that
modern
engineering
can
devise
but
it
will
be
so
low
in
price
that
no
man
making
a
good
salary
will
be
unable
to
own
one
and
enjoy
with
his
family
the
blessing
of
hours
of
pleasure
in
god
great
open
spaces
this
announcement
was
received
not
without
pleasure
the
general
comment
was
if
ford
does
that
he
will
be
out
of
business
in
six
months
the
impression
was
that
a
good
car
could
not
be
built
at
a
low
price
and
that
anyhow
there
was
no
use
in
building
a
car
because
only
wealthy
people
were
in
the
market
for
cars
the
sales
of
more
than
ten
thousand
cars
had
convinced
me
that
we
needed
a
new
factory
we
already
had
a
big
modern
factory
the
piquette
street
plant
it
was
as
good
as
perhaps
a
little
better
than
any
automobile
factory
in
the
country
but
i
did
not
see
how
it
was
going
to
care
for
the
sales
and
production
that
were
inevitable
so
i
bought
sixty
acres
at
highland
park
which
was
then
considered
away
out
in
the
country
from
detroit
the
amount
of
ground
bought
and
the
plans
for
a
bigger
factory
than
the
world
has
ever
seen
were
opposed
the
question
was
already
being
asked
how
soon
will
ford
blow
up
nobody
knows
how
many
thousand
times
it
has
been
asked
since
it
is
asked
only
because
of
the
failure
to
grasp
that
a
principle
rather
than
an
individual
is
at
work
and
the
principle
is
so
simple
that
it
seems
mysterious
for
in
order
to
pay
for
the
new
land
and
buildings
i
slightly
raised
the
prices
this
is
perfectly
justifiable
and
results
in
a
benefit
not
an
injury
to
the
purchaser
i
did
exactly
the
same
thing
a
few
years
ago
or
rather
in
that
case
i
did
not
lower
the
price
as
is
my
annual
custom
in
order
to
build
the
river
rouge
plant
the
extra
money
might
in
each
case
have
been
had
by
borrowing
but
then
we
should
have
had
a
continuing
charge
upon
the
business
and
all
subsequent
cars
would
have
had
to
bear
this
charge
the
price
of
all
the
models
was
increased
with
the
exception
of
the
roadster
which
was
increased
only
and
of
the
landaulet
and
town
car
which
were
increased
and
respectively
we
sold
cars
and
then
for
with
the
new
facilities
i
cut
the
touring
car
from
to
and
we
sold
cars
that
is
the
beginning
of
the
steady
reduction
in
the
price
of
the
cars
in
the
face
of
cost
of
materials
and
wages
contrast
the
year
with
the
year
the
factory
space
increased
from
to
acres
the
average
number
of
employees
from
to
and
the
cars
built
from
a
little
over
six
thousand
to
nearly
thousand
you
will
note
that
men
were
not
employed
in
proportion
to
the
output
we
were
almost
overnight
it
seems
in
great
production
how
did
all
this
come
about
simply
through
the
application
of
an
inevitable
principle
by
the
application
of
intelligently
directed
power
and
machinery
in
a
little
dark
shop
on
a
side
street
an
old
man
had
laboured
for
years
making
axe
handles
out
of
seasoned
hickory
he
fashioned
them
with
the
help
of
a
draw
shave
a
chisel
and
a
supply
of
sandpaper
carefully
was
each
handle
weighed
and
balanced
no
two
of
them
were
alike
the
curve
must
exactly
fit
the
hand
and
must
conform
to
the
grain
of
the
wood
from
dawn
until
dark
the
old
man
laboured
his
average
product
was
eight
handles
a
week
for
which
he
received
a
dollar
and
a
half
each
and
often
some
of
these
were
unsaleable
because
the
balance
was
not
true
you
can
buy
a
better
axe
handle
made
by
machinery
for
a
few
cents
and
you
need
not
worry
about
the
balance
they
are
all
alike
and
every
one
is
perfect
modern
methods
applied
in
a
big
way
have
not
only
brought
the
cost
of
axe
handles
down
to
a
fraction
of
their
former
cost
but
they
have
immensely
improved
the
product
it
was
the
application
of
these
same
methods
to
the
making
of
the
ford
car
that
at
the
very
start
lowered
the
price
and
heightened
the
quality
we
just
developed
an
idea
the
nucleus
of
a
business
may
be
an
idea
that
is
an
inventor
or
a
thoughtful
workman
works
out
a
new
and
better
way
to
serve
some
established
human
need
the
idea
commends
itself
and
people
want
to
avail
themselves
of
it
in
this
way
a
single
individual
may
prove
through
his
idea
or
discovery
the
nucleus
of
a
business
but
the
creation
of
the
body
and
bulk
of
that
business
is
shared
by
everyone
who
has
anything
to
do
with
it
no
manufacturer
can
say
i
built
this
business
if
he
has
required
the
help
of
thousands
of
men
in
building
it
it
is
a
joint
production
everyone
employed
in
it
has
contributed
something
to
it
by
working
and
producing
they
make
it
possible
for
the
purchasing
world
to
keep
coming
to
that
business
for
the
type
of
service
it
provides
and
thus
they
help
establish
a
custom
a
trade
a
habit
which
supplies
them
with
a
livelihood
that
is
the
way
our
company
grew
and
just
how
i
shall
start
explaining
in
the
next
chapter
in
the
meantime
the
company
had
become
we
had
branches
in
london
and
in
australia
we
were
shipping
to
every
part
of
the
world
and
in
england
particularly
we
were
beginning
to
be
as
well
known
as
in
america
the
introduction
of
the
car
in
england
was
somewhat
difficult
on
account
of
the
failure
of
the
american
bicycle
because
the
american
bicycle
had
not
been
suited
to
english
uses
it
was
taken
for
granted
and
made
a
point
of
by
the
distributors
that
no
american
vehicle
could
appeal
to
the
british
market
two
model
a
found
their
way
to
england
in
the
newspapers
refused
to
notice
them
the
automobile
agents
refused
to
take
the
slightest
interest
it
was
rumoured
that
the
principal
components
of
its
manufacture
were
string
and
hoop
wire
and
that
a
buyer
would
be
lucky
if
it
held
together
for
a
fortnight
in
the
first
year
about
a
dozen
cars
in
all
were
used
the
second
was
only
a
little
better
and
i
may
say
as
to
the
reliability
of
that
model
a
that
most
of
them
after
nearly
twenty
years
are
still
in
some
kind
of
service
in
england
in
our
agent
entered
a
model
c
in
the
scottish
reliability
trials
in
those
days
reliability
runs
were
more
popular
in
england
than
motor
races
perhaps
there
was
no
inkling
that
after
all
an
automobile
was
not
merely
a
toy
the
scottish
trials
was
over
eight
hundred
miles
of
hilly
heavy
roads
the
ford
came
through
with
only
one
involuntary
stop
against
it
that
started
the
ford
sales
in
england
in
that
same
year
ford
taxicabs
were
placed
in
london
for
the
first
time
in
the
next
several
years
the
sales
began
to
pick
up
the
cars
went
into
every
endurance
and
reliability
test
and
won
every
one
of
them
the
brighton
dealer
had
ten
fords
driven
over
the
south
downs
for
two
days
in
a
kind
of
steeplechase
and
every
one
of
them
came
through
as
a
result
six
hundred
cars
were
sold
that
year
in
henry
alexander
drove
a
model
t
to
the
top
of
ben
nevis
feet
that
year
cars
were
sold
in
england
and
it
has
never
since
been
necessary
to
stage
any
kind
of
a
stunt
we
eventually
opened
our
own
factory
at
manchester
at
first
it
was
purely
an
assembling
plant
but
as
the
years
have
gone
by
we
have
progressively
made
more
and
more
of
the
car
chapter
v
getting
into
production
if
a
device
would
save
in
time
just
per
cent
or
increase
results
per
then
its
absence
is
always
a
per
cent
tax
if
the
time
of
a
person
is
worth
fifty
cents
an
hour
a
per
cent
saving
is
worth
five
cents
an
hour
if
the
owner
of
a
skyscraper
could
increase
his
income
per
he
would
willingly
pay
half
the
increase
just
to
know
how
the
reason
why
he
owns
a
skyscraper
is
that
science
has
proved
that
certain
materials
used
in
a
given
way
can
save
space
and
increase
rental
incomes
a
building
thirty
stories
high
needs
no
more
ground
space
than
one
five
stories
high
getting
along
with
the
architecture
costs
the
man
the
income
of
floors
save
ten
steps
a
day
for
each
of
twelve
thousand
employees
and
you
will
have
saved
fifty
miles
of
wasted
motion
and
misspent
energy
those
are
the
principles
on
which
the
production
of
my
plant
was
built
up
they
all
come
practically
as
of
course
in
the
beginning
we
tried
to
get
machinists
as
the
necessity
for
production
increased
it
became
apparent
not
only
that
enough
machinists
were
not
to
be
had
but
also
that
skilled
men
were
not
necessary
in
production
and
out
of
this
grew
a
principle
that
i
later
want
to
present
in
full
it
is
that
a
majority
of
the
people
in
the
world
are
not
mentally
even
if
they
are
physically
capable
of
making
a
good
living
that
is
they
are
not
capable
of
furnishing
with
their
own
hands
a
sufficient
quantity
of
the
goods
which
this
world
needs
to
be
able
to
exchange
their
unaided
product
for
the
goods
which
they
need
i
have
heard
it
said
in
fact
i
believe
it
is
quite
a
current
thought
that
we
have
taken
skill
out
of
work
we
have
not
we
have
put
in
skill
we
have
put
a
higher
skill
into
planning
management
and
tool
building
and
the
results
of
that
skill
are
enjoyed
by
the
man
who
is
not
skilled
this
i
shall
later
enlarge
on
we
have
to
recognize
the
unevenness
in
human
mental
equipments
if
every
job
in
our
place
required
skill
the
place
would
never
have
existed
sufficiently
skilled
men
to
the
number
needed
could
not
have
been
trained
in
a
hundred
years
a
million
men
working
by
hand
could
not
even
approximate
our
present
daily
output
no
one
could
manage
a
million
men
but
more
important
than
that
the
product
of
the
unaided
hands
of
those
million
men
could
not
be
sold
at
a
price
in
consonance
with
buying
power
and
even
if
it
were
possible
to
imagine
such
an
aggregation
and
imagine
its
management
and
correlation
just
think
of
the
area
that
it
would
have
to
occupy
how
many
of
the
men
would
be
engaged
not
in
producing
but
in
merely
carrying
from
place
to
place
what
the
other
men
had
produced
i
can
not
see
how
under
such
conditions
the
men
could
possibly
be
paid
more
than
ten
or
twenty
cents
a
day
for
of
course
it
is
not
the
employer
who
pays
wages
he
only
handles
the
money
it
is
the
product
that
pays
the
wages
and
it
is
the
management
that
arranges
the
production
so
that
the
product
may
pay
the
wages
the
more
economical
methods
of
production
did
not
begin
all
at
once
they
began
gradually
just
as
we
began
gradually
to
make
our
own
parts
model
t
was
the
first
motor
that
we
made
ourselves
the
great
economies
began
in
assembling
and
then
extended
to
other
sections
so
that
while
we
have
skilled
mechanics
in
plenty
they
do
not
produce
automobiles
they
make
it
easy
for
others
to
produce
them
our
skilled
men
are
the
tool
makers
the
experimental
workmen
the
machinists
and
the
pattern
makers
they
are
as
good
as
any
men
in
the
world
so
good
indeed
that
they
should
not
be
wasted
in
doing
that
which
the
machines
they
contrive
can
do
better
the
rank
and
file
of
men
come
to
us
unskilled
they
learn
their
jobs
within
a
few
hours
or
a
few
days
if
they
do
not
learn
within
that
time
they
will
never
be
of
any
use
to
us
these
men
are
many
of
them
foreigners
and
all
that
is
required
before
they
are
taken
on
is
that
they
should
be
potentially
able
to
do
enough
work
to
pay
the
overhead
charges
on
the
floor
space
they
occupy
they
do
not
have
to
be
men
we
have
jobs
that
require
great
physical
strength
although
they
are
rapidly
lessening
we
have
other
jobs
that
require
no
strength
whatsoever
jobs
which
as
far
as
strength
is
concerned
might
be
attended
to
by
a
child
of
three
it
is
not
possible
without
going
deeply
into
technical
processes
to
present
the
whole
development
of
manufacturing
step
by
step
in
the
order
in
which
each
thing
came
about
i
do
not
know
that
this
could
be
done
because
something
has
been
happening
nearly
every
day
and
nobody
can
keep
track
take
at
random
a
number
of
the
changes
from
them
it
is
possible
not
only
to
gain
some
idea
of
what
will
happen
when
this
world
is
put
on
a
production
basis
but
also
to
see
how
much
more
we
pay
for
things
than
we
ought
to
and
how
much
lower
wages
are
than
they
ought
to
be
and
what
a
vast
field
remains
to
be
explored
the
ford
company
is
only
a
little
way
along
on
the
journey
a
ford
car
contains
about
five
thousand
parts
that
is
counting
screws
nuts
and
all
some
of
the
parts
are
fairly
bulky
and
others
are
almost
the
size
of
watch
parts
in
our
first
assembling
we
simply
started
to
put
a
car
together
at
a
spot
on
the
floor
and
workmen
brought
to
it
the
parts
as
they
were
needed
in
exactly
the
same
way
that
one
builds
a
house
when
we
started
to
make
parts
it
was
natural
to
create
a
single
department
of
the
factory
to
make
that
part
but
usually
one
workman
performed
all
of
the
operations
necessary
on
a
small
part
the
rapid
press
of
production
made
it
necessary
to
devise
plans
of
production
that
would
avoid
having
the
workers
falling
over
one
another
the
undirected
worker
spends
more
of
his
time
walking
about
for
materials
and
tools
than
he
does
in
working
he
gets
small
pay
because
pedestrianism
is
not
a
highly
paid
line
the
first
step
forward
in
assembly
came
when
we
began
taking
the
work
to
the
men
instead
of
the
men
to
the
work
we
now
have
two
general
principles
in
all
operations
that
a
man
shall
never
have
to
take
more
than
one
step
if
possibly
it
can
be
avoided
and
that
no
man
need
ever
stoop
over
the
principles
of
assembly
are
these
place
the
tools
and
the
men
in
the
sequence
of
the
operation
so
that
each
component
part
shall
travel
the
least
possible
distance
while
in
the
process
of
finishing
use
work
slides
or
some
other
form
of
carrier
so
that
when
a
workman
completes
his
operation
he
drops
the
part
always
in
the
same
place
which
place
must
always
be
the
most
convenient
place
to
his
hand
and
if
possible
have
gravity
carry
the
part
to
the
next
workman
for
his
operation
use
sliding
assembling
lines
by
which
the
parts
to
be
assembled
are
delivered
at
convenient
distances
the
net
result
of
the
application
of
these
principles
is
the
reduction
of
the
necessity
for
thought
on
the
part
of
the
worker
and
the
reduction
of
his
movements
to
a
minimum
he
does
as
nearly
as
possible
only
one
thing
with
only
one
movement
the
assembling
of
the
chassis
is
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
mind
our
most
interesting
and
perhaps
best
known
operation
and
at
one
time
it
was
an
exceedingly
important
operation
we
now
ship
out
the
parts
for
assembly
at
the
point
of
distribution
along
about
april
we
first
tried
the
experiment
of
an
assembly
line
we
tried
it
on
assembling
the
flywheel
magneto
we
try
everything
in
a
little
way
first
we
will
rip
out
anything
once
we
discover
a
better
way
but
we
have
to
know
absolutely
that
the
new
way
is
going
to
be
better
than
the
old
before
we
do
anything
drastic
i
believe
that
this
was
the
first
moving
line
ever
installed
the
idea
came
in
a
general
way
from
the
overhead
trolley
that
the
chicago
packers
use
in
dressing
beef
we
had
previously
assembled
the
magneto
in
the
usual
method
with
one
workman
doing
a
complete
job
he
could
turn
out
from
to
forty
pieces
in
a
day
or
about
twenty
minutes
to
an
assembly
what
he
did
alone
was
then
spread
into
operations
that
cut
down
the
assembly
time
to
thirteen
minutes
ten
seconds
then
we
raised
the
height
of
the
line
eight
inches
this
was
in
and
cut
the
time
to
seven
minutes
further
experimenting
with
the
speed
that
the
work
should
move
at
cut
the
time
down
to
five
minutes
in
short
the
result
is
this
by
the
aid
of
scientific
study
one
man
is
now
able
to
do
somewhat
more
than
four
did
only
a
comparatively
few
years
ago
that
line
established
the
efficiency
of
the
method
and
we
now
use
it
everywhere
the
assembling
of
the
motor
formerly
done
by
one
man
is
now
divided
into
operations
those
men
do
the
work
that
three
times
their
number
formerly
did
in
a
short
time
we
tried
out
the
plan
on
the
chassis
about
the
best
we
had
done
in
stationary
chassis
assembling
was
an
average
of
twelve
hours
and
minutes
per
chassis
we
tried
the
experiment
of
drawing
the
chassis
with
a
rope
and
windlass
down
a
line
two
hundred
fifty
feet
long
six
assemblers
traveled
with
the
chassis
and
picked
up
the
parts
from
piles
placed
along
the
line
this
rough
experiment
reduced
the
time
to
five
hours
fifty
minutes
per
chassis
in
the
early
part
of
we
elevated
the
assembly
line
we
had
adopted
the
policy
of
work
we
had
one
line
and
three
quarter
inches
and
another
and
one
half
inches
from
the
floor
to
suit
squads
of
different
heights
the
arrangement
and
a
further
subdivision
of
work
so
that
each
man
had
fewer
movements
cut
down
the
labour
time
per
chassis
to
one
hour
minutes
only
the
chassis
was
then
assembled
in
the
line
the
body
was
placed
on
in
john
street
the
famous
street
that
runs
through
our
highland
park
factories
now
the
line
assembles
the
whole
car
it
must
not
be
imagined
however
that
all
this
worked
out
as
quickly
as
it
sounds
the
speed
of
the
moving
work
had
to
be
carefully
tried
out
in
the
magneto
we
first
had
a
speed
of
sixty
inches
per
minute
that
was
too
fast
then
we
tried
eighteen
inches
per
minute
that
was
too
slow
finally
we
settled
on
inches
per
minute
the
idea
is
that
a
man
must
not
be
hurried
in
his
work
he
must
have
every
second
necessary
but
not
a
single
unnecessary
second
we
have
worked
out
speeds
for
each
assembly
for
the
success
of
the
chassis
assembly
caused
us
gradually
to
overhaul
our
entire
method
of
manufacturing
and
to
put
all
assembling
in
mechanically
driven
lines
the
chassis
assembling
line
for
instance
goes
at
a
pace
of
six
feet
per
minute
the
front
axle
assembly
line
goes
at
one
hundred
inches
per
minute
in
the
chassis
assembling
are
separate
operations
or
stations
the
first
men
fasten
four
brackets
to
the
chassis
frame
the
motor
arrives
on
the
tenth
operation
and
so
on
in
detail
some
men
do
only
one
or
two
small
operations
others
do
more
the
man
who
places
a
part
does
not
fasten
it
the
part
may
not
be
fully
in
place
until
after
several
operations
later
the
man
who
puts
in
a
bolt
does
not
put
on
the
nut
the
man
who
puts
on
the
nut
does
not
tighten
it
on
operation
number
the
budding
motor
gets
its
gasoline
it
has
previously
received
lubrication
on
operation
number
the
radiator
is
filled
with
water
and
on
operation
number
the
car
drives
out
onto
john
street
essentially
the
same
ideas
have
been
applied
to
the
assembling
of
the
motor
in
october
it
required
nine
hours
and
minutes
of
labour
time
to
assemble
one
motor
six
months
later
by
the
moving
assembly
method
this
time
had
been
reduced
to
five
hours
and
minutes
every
piece
of
work
in
the
shops
moves
it
may
move
on
hooks
on
overhead
chains
going
to
assembly
in
the
exact
order
in
which
the
parts
are
required
it
may
travel
on
a
moving
platform
or
it
may
go
by
gravity
but
the
point
is
that
there
is
no
lifting
or
trucking
of
anything
other
than
materials
materials
are
brought
in
on
small
trucks
or
trailers
operated
by
ford
chassis
which
are
sufficiently
mobile
and
quick
to
get
in
and
out
of
any
aisle
where
they
may
be
required
to
go
no
workman
has
anything
to
do
with
moving
or
lifting
anything
that
is
all
in
a
separate
department
the
department
of
transportation
we
started
assembling
a
motor
car
in
a
single
factory
then
as
we
began
to
make
parts
we
began
to
departmentalize
so
that
each
department
would
do
only
one
thing
as
the
factory
is
now
organized
each
department
makes
only
a
single
part
or
assembles
a
part
a
department
is
a
little
factory
in
itself
the
part
comes
into
it
as
raw
material
or
as
a
casting
goes
through
the
sequence
of
machines
and
heat
treatments
or
whatever
may
be
required
and
leaves
that
department
finished
it
was
only
because
of
transport
ease
that
the
departments
were
grouped
together
when
we
started
to
manufacture
i
did
not
know
that
such
minute
divisions
would
be
possible
but
as
our
production
grew
and
departments
multiplied
we
actually
changed
from
making
automobiles
to
making
parts
then
we
found
that
we
had
made
another
new
discovery
which
was
that
by
no
means
all
of
the
parts
had
to
be
made
in
one
factory
it
was
not
really
a
discovery
it
was
something
in
the
nature
of
going
around
in
a
circle
to
my
first
manufacturing
when
i
bought
the
motors
and
probably
ninety
per
cent
of
the
parts
when
we
began
to
make
our
own
parts
we
practically
took
for
granted
that
they
all
had
to
be
made
in
the
one
factory
that
there
was
some
special
virtue
in
having
a
single
roof
over
the
manufacture
of
the
entire
car
we
have
now
developed
away
from
this
if
we
build
any
more
large
factories
it
will
be
only
because
the
making
of
a
single
part
must
be
in
such
tremendous
volume
as
to
require
a
large
unit
i
hope
that
in
the
course
of
time
the
big
highland
park
plant
will
be
doing
only
one
or
two
things
the
casting
has
already
been
taken
away
from
it
and
has
gone
to
the
river
rouge
plant
so
now
we
are
on
our
way
back
to
where
we
started
from
excepting
that
instead
of
buying
our
parts
on
the
outside
we
are
beginning
to
make
them
in
our
own
factories
on
the
outside
this
is
a
development
which
holds
exceptional
consequences
for
it
means
as
i
shall
enlarge
in
a
later
chapter
that
highly
standardized
highly
subdivided
industry
need
no
longer
become
concentrated
in
large
plants
with
all
the
inconveniences
of
transportation
and
housing
that
hamper
large
plants
a
thousand
or
five
hundred
men
ought
to
be
enough
in
a
single
factory
then
there
would
be
no
problem
of
transporting
them
to
work
or
away
from
work
and
there
would
be
no
slums
or
any
of
the
other
unnatural
ways
of
living
incident
to
the
overcrowding
that
must
take
place
if
the
workmen
are
to
live
within
reasonable
distances
of
a
very
large
plant
highland
park
now
has
five
hundred
departments
down
at
our
piquette
plant
we
had
only
eighteen
departments
and
formerly
at
highland
park
we
had
only
one
hundred
and
fifty
departments
this
illustrates
how
far
we
are
going
in
the
manufacture
of
parts
hardly
a
week
passes
without
some
improvement
being
made
somewhere
in
machine
or
process
and
sometimes
this
is
made
in
defiance
of
what
is
called
the
best
shop
practice
i
recall
that
a
machine
manufacturer
was
once
called
into
conference
on
the
building
of
a
special
machine
the
specifications
called
for
an
output
of
two
hundred
per
hour
this
is
a
mistake
said
the
manufacturer
you
mean
two
hundred
a
day
no
machine
can
be
forced
to
two
hundred
an
hour
the
company
officer
sent
for
the
man
who
had
designed
the
machine
and
they
called
his
attention
to
the
specification
he
said
yes
what
about
it
it
ca
be
done
said
the
manufacturer
positively
no
machine
built
will
do
that
it
is
out
of
the
question
out
of
the
question
exclaimed
the
engineer
if
you
will
come
down
to
the
main
floor
you
will
see
one
doing
it
we
built
one
to
see
if
it
could
be
done
and
now
we
want
more
like
it
the
factory
keeps
no
record
of
experiments
the
foremen
and
superintendents
remember
what
has
been
done
if
a
certain
method
has
formerly
been
tried
and
failed
somebody
will
remember
it
but
i
am
not
particularly
anxious
for
the
men
to
remember
what
someone
else
has
tried
to
do
in
the
past
for
then
we
might
quickly
accumulate
far
too
many
things
that
could
not
be
done
that
is
one
of
the
troubles
with
extensive
records
if
you
keep
on
recording
all
of
your
failures
you
will
shortly
have
a
list
showing
that
there
is
nothing
left
for
you
to
try
whereas
it
by
no
means
follows
because
one
man
has
failed
in
a
certain
method
that
another
man
will
not
succeed
they
told
us
we
could
not
cast
gray
iron
by
our
endless
chain
method
and
i
believe
there
is
a
record
of
failures
but
we
are
doing
it
the
man
who
carried
through
our
work
either
did
not
know
or
paid
no
attention
to
the
previous
figures
likewise
we
were
told
that
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
pour
the
hot
iron
directly
from
the
blast
furnace
into
mould
the
usual
method
is
to
run
the
iron
into
pigs
let
them
season
for
a
time
and
then
remelt
them
for
casting
but
at
the
river
rouge
plant
we
are
casting
directly
from
cupolas
that
are
filled
from
the
blast
furnaces
then
too
a
record
of
failures
particularly
if
it
is
a
dignified
and
record
deters
a
young
man
from
trying
we
get
some
of
our
best
results
from
letting
fools
rush
in
where
angels
fear
to
tread
none
of
our
men
are
experts
we
have
most
unfortunately
found
it
necessary
to
get
rid
of
a
man
as
soon
as
he
thinks
himself
an
expert
because
no
one
ever
considers
himself
expert
if
he
really
knows
his
job
a
man
who
knows
a
job
sees
so
much
more
to
be
done
than
he
has
done
that
he
is
always
pressing
forward
and
never
gives
up
an
instant
of
thought
to
how
good
and
how
efficient
he
is
thinking
always
ahead
thinking
always
of
trying
to
do
more
brings
a
state
of
mind
in
which
nothing
is
impossible
the
moment
one
gets
into
the
expert
state
of
mind
a
great
number
of
things
become
impossible
i
refuse
to
recognize
that
there
are
impossibilities
i
can
not
discover
that
any
one
knows
enough
about
anything
on
this
earth
definitely
to
say
what
is
and
what
is
not
possible
the
right
kind
of
experience
the
right
kind
of
technical
training
ought
to
enlarge
the
mind
and
reduce
the
number
of
impossibilities
it
unfortunately
does
nothing
of
the
kind
most
technical
training
and
the
average
of
that
which
we
call
experience
provide
a
record
of
previous
failures
and
instead
of
these
failures
being
taken
for
what
they
are
worth
they
are
taken
as
absolute
bars
to
progress
if
some
man
calling
himself
an
authority
says
that
this
or
that
can
not
be
done
then
a
horde
of
unthinking
followers
start
the
chorus
it
ca
be
done
take
castings
castings
has
always
been
a
wasteful
process
and
is
so
old
that
it
has
accumulated
many
traditions
which
make
improvements
extraordinarily
difficult
to
bring
about
i
believe
one
authority
on
moulding
declared
before
we
started
our
experiments
that
any
man
who
said
he
could
reduce
costs
within
half
a
year
wrote
himself
down
as
a
fraud
our
foundry
used
to
be
much
like
other
foundries
when
we
cast
the
first
model
t
cylinders
in
everything
in
the
place
was
done
by
hand
shovels
and
wheelbarrows
abounded
the
work
was
then
either
skilled
or
unskilled
we
had
moulders
and
we
had
labourers
now
we
have
about
five
per
cent
of
thoroughly
skilled
moulders
and
core
setters
but
the
remaining
per
cent
are
unskilled
or
to
put
it
more
accurately
must
be
skilled
in
exactly
one
operation
which
the
most
stupid
man
can
learn
within
two
days
the
moulding
is
all
done
by
machinery
each
part
which
we
have
to
cast
has
a
unit
or
units
of
its
own
according
to
the
number
required
in
the
plan
of
production
the
machinery
of
the
unit
is
adapted
to
the
single
casting
thus
the
men
in
the
unit
each
perform
a
single
operation
that
is
always
the
same
a
unit
consists
of
an
overhead
railway
to
which
at
intervals
are
hung
little
platforms
for
the
moulds
without
going
into
technical
details
let
me
say
the
making
of
the
moulds
and
the
cores
and
the
packing
of
the
cores
are
done
with
the
work
in
motion
on
the
platforms
the
metal
is
poured
at
another
point
as
the
work
moves
and
by
the
time
the
mould
in
which
the
metal
has
been
poured
reaches
the
terminal
it
is
cool
enough
to
start
on
its
automatic
way
to
cleaning
machining
and
assembling
and
the
platform
is
moving
around
for
a
new
load
take
the
development
of
the
assembly
even
under
the
old
plan
this
operation
took
only
three
minutes
and
did
not
seem
to
be
one
to
bother
about
there
were
two
benches
and
men
in
all
they
assembled
one
hundred
pistons
and
rods
in
a
day
which
means
just
five
seconds
over
three
minutes
each
there
was
no
inspection
and
many
of
the
piston
and
rod
assemblies
came
back
from
the
motor
assembling
line
as
defective
it
is
a
very
simple
operation
the
workman
pushed
the
pin
out
of
the
piston
oiled
the
pin
slipped
the
rod
in
place
put
the
pin
through
the
rod
and
piston
tightened
one
screw
and
opened
another
screw
that
was
the
whole
operation
the
foreman
examining
the
operation
could
not
discover
why
it
should
take
as
much
as
three
minutes
he
analyzed
the
motions
with
a
he
found
that
four
hours
out
of
a
day
were
spent
in
walking
the
assembler
did
not
go
off
anywhere
but
he
had
to
shift
his
feet
to
gather
in
his
materials
and
to
push
away
his
finished
piece
in
the
whole
task
each
man
performed
six
operations
the
foreman
devised
a
new
plan
he
split
the
operation
into
three
divisions
put
a
slide
on
the
bench
and
three
men
on
each
side
of
it
and
an
inspector
at
the
end
instead
of
one
man
performing
the
whole
operation
one
man
then
performed
only
one
third
of
the
operation
he
performed
only
as
much
as
he
could
do
without
shifting
his
feet
they
cut
down
the
squad
from
to
fourteen
men
the
former
record
for
men
was
one
hundred
assemblies
a
day
now
seven
men
turn
out
hundred
assemblies
in
eight
hours
it
is
not
necessary
to
calculate
the
savings
there
painting
the
rear
axle
assembly
once
gave
some
trouble
it
used
to
be
dipped
by
hand
into
a
tank
of
enamel
this
required
several
handlings
and
the
services
of
two
men
now
one
man
takes
care
of
it
all
on
a
special
machine
designed
and
built
in
the
factory
the
man
now
merely
hangs
the
assembly
on
a
moving
chain
which
carries
it
up
over
the
enamel
tank
two
levers
then
thrust
thimbles
over
the
ends
of
the
ladle
shaft
the
paint
tank
rises
six
feet
immerses
the
axle
returns
to
position
and
the
axle
goes
on
to
the
drying
oven
the
whole
cycle
of
operations
now
takes
just
thirteen
seconds
the
radiator
is
a
complex
affair
and
soldering
it
used
to
be
a
matter
of
skill
there
are
tubes
in
a
radiator
fitting
and
soldering
these
tubes
in
place
is
by
hand
a
long
operation
requiring
both
skill
and
patience
now
it
is
all
done
by
a
machine
which
will
make
twelve
hundred
radiator
cores
in
eight
hours
then
they
are
soldered
in
place
by
being
carried
through
a
furnace
by
a
conveyor
no
tinsmith
work
and
so
no
skill
are
required
we
used
to
rivet
the
arms
to
the
using
pneumatic
hammers
which
were
supposed
to
be
the
latest
development
it
took
six
men
to
hold
the
hammers
and
six
men
to
hold
the
casings
and
the
din
was
terrific
now
an
automatic
press
operated
by
one
man
who
does
nothing
else
gets
through
five
times
as
much
work
in
a
day
as
those
twelve
men
did
in
the
piquette
plant
the
cylinder
casting
traveled
four
thousand
feet
in
the
course
of
finishing
now
it
travels
only
slightly
over
three
hundred
feet
there
is
no
manual
handling
of
material
there
is
not
a
single
hand
operation
if
a
machine
can
be
made
automatic
it
is
made
automatic
not
a
single
operation
is
ever
considered
as
being
done
in
the
best
or
cheapest
way
at
that
only
about
ten
per
cent
of
our
tools
are
special
the
others
are
regular
machines
adjusted
to
the
particular
job
and
they
are
placed
almost
side
by
side
we
put
more
machinery
per
square
foot
of
floor
space
than
any
other
factory
in
the
world
every
foot
of
space
not
used
carries
an
overhead
expense
we
want
none
of
that
waste
yet
there
is
all
the
room
needed
no
man
has
too
much
room
and
no
man
has
too
little
room
dividing
and
subdividing
operations
keeping
the
work
in
motion
those
are
the
keynotes
of
production
but
also
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
all
the
parts
are
designed
so
that
they
can
be
most
easily
made
and
the
saving
although
the
comparison
is
not
quite
fair
it
is
startling
if
at
our
present
rate
of
production
we
employed
the
same
number
of
men
per
car
that
we
did
when
we
began
in
and
those
men
were
only
for
assembly
we
should
require
a
force
of
more
than
two
hundred
thousand
we
have
less
than
fifty
thousand
men
on
automobile
production
at
our
highest
point
of
around
four
thousand
cars
a
day
chapter
vi
machines
and
men
that
which
one
has
to
fight
hardest
against
in
bringing
together
a
large
number
of
people
to
do
work
is
excess
organization
and
consequent
red
tape
to
my
mind
there
is
no
bent
of
mind
more
dangerous
than
that
which
is
sometimes
described
as
the
genius
for
organization
this
usually
results
in
the
birth
of
a
great
big
chart
showing
after
the
fashion
of
a
family
tree
how
authority
ramifies
the
tree
is
heavy
with
nice
round
berries
each
of
which
bears
the
name
of
a
man
or
of
an
office
every
man
has
a
title
and
certain
duties
which
are
strictly
limited
by
the
circumference
of
his
berry
if
a
straw
boss
wants
to
say
something
to
the
general
superintendent
his
message
has
to
go
through
the
the
foreman
the
department
head
and
all
the
assistant
superintendents
before
in
the
course
of
time
it
reaches
the
general
superintendent
probably
by
that
time
what
he
wanted
to
talk
about
is
already
history
it
takes
about
six
weeks
for
the
message
of
a
man
living
in
a
berry
on
the
lower
corner
of
the
chart
to
reach
the
president
or
chairman
of
the
board
and
if
it
ever
does
reach
one
of
these
august
officials
it
has
by
that
time
gathered
to
itself
about
a
pound
of
criticisms
suggestions
and
comments
very
few
things
are
ever
taken
under
official
consideration
until
long
after
the
time
when
they
actually
ought
to
have
been
done
the
buck
is
passed
to
and
fro
and
all
responsibility
is
dodged
by
individuals
following
the
lazy
notion
that
two
heads
are
better
than
one
now
a
business
in
my
way
of
thinking
is
not
a
machine
it
is
a
collection
of
people
who
are
brought
together
to
do
work
and
not
to
write
letters
to
one
another
it
is
not
necessary
for
any
one
department
to
know
what
any
other
department
is
doing
if
a
man
is
doing
his
work
he
will
not
have
time
to
take
up
any
other
work
it
is
the
business
of
those
who
plan
the
entire
work
to
see
that
all
of
the
departments
are
working
properly
toward
the
same
end
it
is
not
necessary
to
have
meetings
to
establish
good
feeling
between
individuals
or
departments
it
is
not
necessary
for
people
to
love
each
other
in
order
to
work
together
too
much
good
fellowship
may
indeed
be
a
very
bad
thing
for
it
may
lead
to
one
man
trying
to
cover
up
the
faults
of
another
that
is
bad
for
both
men
when
we
are
at
work
we
ought
to
be
at
work
when
we
are
at
play
we
ought
to
be
at
play
there
is
no
use
trying
to
mix
the
two
the
sole
object
ought
to
be
to
get
the
work
done
and
to
get
paid
for
it
when
the
work
is
done
then
the
play
can
come
but
not
before
and
so
the
ford
factories
and
enterprises
have
no
organization
no
specific
duties
attaching
to
any
position
no
line
of
succession
or
of
authority
very
few
titles
and
no
conferences
we
have
only
the
clerical
help
that
is
absolutely
required
we
have
no
elaborate
records
of
any
kind
and
consequently
no
red
tape
we
make
the
individual
responsibility
complete
the
workman
is
absolutely
responsible
for
his
work
the
straw
boss
is
responsible
for
the
workmen
under
him
the
foreman
is
responsible
for
his
group
the
department
head
is
responsible
for
the
department
the
general
superintendent
is
responsible
for
the
whole
factory
every
man
has
to
know
what
is
going
on
in
his
sphere
i
say
general
superintendent
there
is
no
such
formal
title
one
man
is
in
charge
of
the
factory
and
has
been
for
years
he
has
two
men
with
him
who
without
in
any
way
having
their
duties
defined
have
taken
particular
sections
of
the
work
to
themselves
with
them
are
about
half
a
dozen
other
men
in
the
nature
of
assistants
but
without
specific
duties
they
have
all
made
jobs
for
themselves
but
there
are
no
limits
to
their
jobs
they
just
work
in
where
they
best
fit
one
man
chases
stock
and
shortages
another
has
grabbed
inspection
and
so
on
this
may
seem
haphazard
but
it
is
not
a
group
of
men
wholly
intent
upon
getting
work
done
have
no
difficulty
in
seeing
that
the
work
is
done
they
do
not
get
into
trouble
about
the
limits
of
authority
because
they
are
not
thinking
of
titles
if
they
had
offices
and
all
that
they
would
shortly
be
giving
up
their
time
to
office
work
and
to
wondering
why
did
they
not
have
a
better
office
than
some
other
fellow
because
there
are
no
titles
and
no
limits
of
authority
there
is
no
question
of
red
tape
or
going
over
a
man
head
any
workman
can
go
to
anybody
and
so
established
has
become
this
custom
that
a
foreman
does
not
get
sore
if
a
workman
goes
over
him
and
directly
to
the
head
of
the
factory
the
workman
rarely
ever
does
so
because
a
foreman
knows
as
well
as
he
knows
his
own
name
that
if
he
has
been
unjust
it
will
be
very
quickly
found
out
and
he
shall
no
longer
be
a
foreman
one
of
the
things
that
we
will
not
tolerate
is
injustice
of
any
kind
the
moment
a
man
starts
to
swell
with
authority
he
is
discovered
and
he
goes
out
or
goes
back
to
a
machine
a
large
amount
of
labour
unrest
comes
from
the
unjust
exercise
of
authority
by
those
in
subordinate
positions
and
i
am
afraid
that
in
far
too
many
manufacturing
institutions
it
is
really
not
possible
for
a
workman
to
get
a
square
deal
the
work
and
the
work
alone
controls
us
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
have
no
titles
most
men
can
swing
a
job
but
they
are
floored
by
a
title
the
effect
of
a
title
is
very
peculiar
it
has
been
used
too
much
as
a
sign
of
emancipation
from
work
it
is
almost
equivalent
to
a
badge
bearing
the
legend
this
man
has
nothing
to
do
but
regard
himself
as
important
and
all
others
as
inferior
not
only
is
a
title
often
injurious
to
the
wearer
but
it
has
its
effect
on
others
as
well
there
is
perhaps
no
greater
single
source
of
personal
dissatisfaction
among
men
than
the
fact
that
the
are
not
always
the
real
leaders
everybody
acknowledges
a
real
leader
a
man
who
is
fit
to
plan
and
command
and
when
you
find
a
real
leader
who
bears
a
title
you
will
have
to
inquire
of
someone
else
what
his
title
is
he
does
boast
about
it
titles
in
business
have
been
greatly
overdone
and
business
has
suffered
one
of
the
bad
features
is
the
division
of
responsibility
according
to
titles
which
goes
so
far
as
to
amount
to
a
removal
altogether
of
responsibility
where
responsibility
is
broken
up
into
many
small
bits
and
divided
among
many
departments
each
department
under
its
own
titular
head
who
in
turn
is
surrounded
by
a
group
bearing
their
nice
it
is
difficult
to
find
any
one
who
really
feels
responsible
everyone
knows
what
passing
the
buck
means
the
game
must
have
originated
in
industrial
organizations
where
the
departments
simply
shove
responsibility
along
the
health
of
every
organization
depends
on
every
member
whatever
his
place
feeling
that
everything
that
happens
to
come
to
his
notice
relating
to
the
welfare
of
the
business
is
his
own
job
railroads
have
gone
to
the
devil
under
the
eyes
of
departments
that
say
oh
that
does
come
under
our
department
department
x
miles
away
has
that
in
charge
there
used
to
be
a
lot
of
advice
given
to
officials
not
to
hide
behind
their
titles
the
very
necessity
for
the
advice
showed
a
condition
that
needed
more
than
advice
to
correct
it
and
the
correction
is
just
this
abolish
the
titles
a
few
may
be
legally
necessary
a
few
may
be
useful
in
directing
the
public
how
to
do
business
with
the
concern
but
for
the
rest
the
best
rule
is
simple
get
rid
of
them
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
record
of
business
in
general
just
now
is
such
as
to
detract
very
much
from
the
value
of
titles
no
one
would
boast
of
being
president
of
a
bankrupt
bank
business
on
the
whole
has
not
been
so
skillfully
steered
as
to
leave
much
margin
for
pride
in
the
steersmen
the
men
who
bear
titles
now
and
are
worth
anything
are
forgetting
their
titles
and
are
down
in
the
foundation
of
business
looking
for
the
weak
spots
they
are
back
again
in
the
places
from
which
they
rose
trying
to
reconstruct
from
the
bottom
up
and
when
a
man
is
really
at
work
he
needs
no
title
his
work
honours
him
all
of
our
people
come
into
the
factory
or
the
offices
through
the
employment
departments
as
i
have
said
we
do
not
hire
experts
neither
do
we
hire
men
on
past
experiences
or
for
any
position
other
than
the
lowest
since
we
do
not
take
a
man
on
his
past
history
we
do
not
refuse
him
because
of
his
past
history
i
never
met
a
man
who
was
thoroughly
bad
there
is
always
some
good
in
him
if
he
gets
a
chance
that
is
the
reason
we
do
not
care
in
the
least
about
a
man
antecedents
we
do
not
hire
a
man
history
we
hire
the
man
if
he
has
been
in
jail
that
is
no
reason
to
say
that
he
will
be
in
jail
again
i
think
on
the
contrary
he
is
if
given
a
chance
very
likely
to
make
a
special
effort
to
keep
out
of
jail
our
employment
office
does
not
bar
a
man
for
anything
he
has
previously
done
he
is
equally
acceptable
whether
he
has
been
in
sing
sing
or
at
harvard
and
we
do
not
even
inquire
from
which
place
he
has
graduated
all
that
he
needs
is
the
desire
to
work
if
he
does
not
desire
to
work
it
is
very
unlikely
that
he
will
apply
for
a
position
for
it
is
pretty
well
understood
that
a
man
in
the
ford
plant
works
we
do
not
to
repeat
care
what
a
man
has
been
if
he
has
gone
to
college
he
ought
to
be
able
to
go
ahead
faster
but
he
has
to
start
at
the
bottom
and
prove
his
ability
every
man
future
rests
solely
with
himself
there
is
far
too
much
loose
talk
about
men
being
unable
to
obtain
recognition
with
us
every
man
is
fairly
certain
to
get
the
exact
recognition
he
deserves
of
course
there
are
certain
factors
in
the
desire
for
recognition
which
must
be
reckoned
with
the
whole
modern
industrial
system
has
warped
the
desire
so
out
of
shape
that
it
is
now
almost
an
obsession
there
was
a
time
when
a
man
personal
advancement
depended
entirely
and
immediately
upon
his
work
and
not
upon
any
one
favor
but
nowadays
it
often
depends
far
too
much
upon
the
individual
good
fortune
in
catching
some
influential
eye
that
is
what
we
have
successfully
fought
against
men
will
work
with
the
idea
of
catching
somebody
eye
they
will
work
with
the
idea
that
if
they
fail
to
get
credit
for
what
they
have
done
they
might
as
well
have
done
it
badly
or
not
have
done
it
at
all
thus
the
work
sometimes
becomes
a
secondary
consideration
the
job
in
hand
the
article
in
hand
the
special
kind
of
service
in
hand
turns
out
to
be
not
the
principal
job
the
main
work
becomes
personal
advancement
a
platform
from
which
to
catch
somebody
eye
this
habit
of
making
the
work
secondary
and
the
recognition
primary
is
unfair
to
the
work
it
makes
recognition
and
credit
the
real
job
and
this
also
has
an
unfortunate
effect
on
the
worker
it
encourages
a
peculiar
kind
of
ambition
which
is
neither
lovely
nor
productive
it
produces
the
kind
of
man
who
imagines
that
by
standing
in
with
the
boss
he
will
get
ahead
every
shop
knows
this
kind
of
man
and
the
worst
of
it
is
there
are
some
things
in
the
present
industrial
system
which
make
it
appear
that
the
game
really
pays
foremen
are
only
human
it
is
natural
that
they
should
be
flattered
by
being
made
to
believe
that
they
hold
the
weal
or
woe
of
workmen
in
their
hands
it
is
natural
also
that
being
open
to
flattery
their
subordinates
should
flatter
them
still
more
to
obtain
and
profit
by
their
favor
that
is
why
i
want
as
little
as
possible
of
the
personal
element
it
is
particularly
easy
for
any
man
who
never
knows
it
all
to
go
forward
to
a
higher
position
with
us
some
men
will
work
hard
but
they
do
not
possess
the
capacity
to
think
and
especially
to
think
quickly
such
men
get
as
far
as
their
ability
deserves
a
man
may
by
his
industry
deserve
advancement
but
it
can
not
be
possibly
given
him
unless
he
also
has
a
certain
element
of
leadership
this
is
not
a
dream
world
we
are
living
in
i
think
that
every
man
in
the
process
of
our
factory
eventually
lands
about
where
he
belongs
we
are
never
satisfied
with
the
way
that
everything
is
done
in
any
part
of
the
organization
we
always
think
it
ought
to
be
done
better
and
that
eventually
it
will
be
done
better
the
spirit
of
crowding
forces
the
man
who
has
the
qualities
for
a
higher
place
eventually
to
get
it
he
perhaps
would
not
get
the
place
if
at
any
time
the
organization
which
is
a
word
i
do
not
like
to
use
became
fixed
so
that
there
would
be
routine
steps
and
dead
men
shoes
but
we
have
so
few
titles
that
a
man
who
ought
to
be
doing
something
better
than
he
is
doing
very
soon
gets
to
doing
it
he
is
not
restrained
by
the
fact
that
there
is
no
position
ahead
of
him
open
for
there
are
no
positions
we
have
no
places
our
best
men
make
their
places
this
is
easy
enough
to
do
for
there
is
always
work
and
when
you
think
of
getting
the
work
done
instead
of
finding
a
title
to
fit
a
man
who
wants
to
be
promoted
then
there
is
no
difficulty
about
promotion
the
promotion
itself
is
not
formal
the
man
simply
finds
himself
doing
something
other
than
what
he
was
doing
and
getting
more
money
all
of
our
people
have
thus
come
up
from
the
bottom
the
head
of
the
factory
started
as
a
machinist
the
man
in
charge
of
the
big
river
rouge
plant
began
as
a
patternmaker
another
man
overseeing
one
of
the
principal
departments
started
as
a
sweeper
there
is
not
a
single
man
anywhere
in
the
factory
who
did
not
simply
come
in
off
the
street
everything
that
we
have
developed
has
been
done
by
men
who
have
qualified
themselves
with
us
we
fortunately
did
not
inherit
any
traditions
and
we
are
not
founding
any
if
we
have
a
tradition
it
is
this
everything
can
always
be
done
better
than
it
is
being
done
that
pressing
always
to
do
work
better
and
faster
solves
nearly
every
factory
problem
a
department
gets
its
standing
on
its
rate
of
production
the
rate
of
production
and
the
cost
of
production
are
distinct
elements
the
foremen
and
superintendents
would
only
be
wasting
time
were
they
to
keep
a
check
on
the
costs
in
their
departments
there
are
certain
costs
such
as
the
rate
of
wages
the
overhead
the
price
of
materials
and
the
like
which
they
could
not
in
any
way
control
so
they
do
not
bother
about
them
what
they
can
control
is
the
rate
of
production
in
their
own
departments
the
rating
of
a
department
is
gained
by
dividing
the
number
of
parts
produced
by
the
number
of
hands
working
every
foreman
checks
his
own
department
daily
he
carries
the
figures
always
with
him
the
superintendent
has
a
tabulation
of
all
the
scores
if
there
is
something
wrong
in
a
department
the
output
score
shows
it
at
once
the
superintendent
makes
inquiries
and
the
foreman
looks
alive
a
considerable
part
of
the
incentive
to
better
methods
is
directly
traceable
to
this
simple
method
of
rating
production
the
foreman
need
not
be
a
cost
accountant
he
is
no
better
a
foreman
for
being
one
his
charges
are
the
machines
and
the
human
beings
in
his
department
when
they
are
working
at
their
best
he
has
performed
his
service
the
rate
of
his
production
is
his
guide
there
is
no
reason
for
him
to
scatter
his
energies
over
collateral
subjects
this
rating
system
simply
forces
a
foreman
to
forget
personalities
to
forget
everything
other
than
the
work
in
hand
if
he
should
select
the
people
he
likes
instead
of
the
people
who
can
best
do
the
work
his
department
record
will
quickly
show
up
that
fact
there
is
no
difficulty
in
picking
out
men
they
pick
themselves
out
because
although
one
hears
a
great
deal
about
the
lack
of
opportunity
for
advancement
the
average
workman
is
more
interested
in
a
steady
job
than
he
is
in
advancement
scarcely
more
than
five
per
cent
of
those
who
work
for
wages
while
they
have
the
desire
to
receive
more
money
have
also
the
willingness
to
accept
the
additional
responsibility
and
the
additional
work
which
goes
with
the
higher
places
only
about
per
cent
are
even
willing
to
be
straw
bosses
and
most
of
them
take
that
position
because
it
carries
with
it
more
pay
than
working
on
a
machine
men
of
a
more
mechanical
turn
of
mind
but
with
no
desire
for
responsibility
go
into
the
departments
where
they
receive
considerably
more
pay
than
in
production
proper
but
the
vast
majority
of
men
want
to
stay
put
they
want
to
be
led
they
want
to
have
everything
done
for
them
and
to
have
no
responsibility
therefore
in
spite
of
the
great
mass
of
men
the
difficulty
is
not
to
discover
men
to
advance
but
men
who
are
willing
to
be
advanced
the
accepted
theory
is
that
all
people
are
anxious
for
advancement
and
a
great
many
pretty
plans
have
been
built
up
from
that
i
can
only
say
that
we
do
not
find
that
to
be
the
case
the
americans
in
our
employ
do
want
to
go
ahead
but
they
by
no
means
do
always
want
to
go
clear
through
to
the
top
the
foreigners
generally
speaking
are
content
to
stay
as
straw
bosses
why
all
of
this
is
i
do
not
know
i
am
giving
the
facts
as
i
have
said
everyone
in
the
place
reserves
an
open
mind
as
to
the
way
in
which
every
job
is
being
done
if
there
is
any
fixed
theory
any
fixed
rule
it
is
that
no
job
is
being
done
well
enough
the
whole
factory
management
is
always
open
to
suggestion
and
we
have
an
informal
suggestion
system
by
which
any
workman
can
communicate
any
idea
that
comes
to
him
and
get
action
on
it
the
saving
of
a
cent
per
piece
may
be
distinctly
worth
while
a
saving
of
one
cent
on
a
part
at
our
present
rate
of
production
represents
twelve
thousand
dollars
a
year
one
cent
saved
on
each
part
would
amount
to
millions
a
year
therefore
in
comparing
savings
the
calculations
are
carried
out
to
the
thousandth
part
of
a
cent
if
the
new
way
suggested
shows
a
saving
and
the
cost
of
making
the
change
will
pay
for
itself
within
a
reasonable
time
say
within
three
months
the
change
is
made
practically
as
of
course
these
changes
are
by
no
means
limited
to
improvements
which
will
increase
production
or
decrease
cost
a
great
many
perhaps
most
of
them
are
in
the
line
of
making
the
work
easier
we
do
not
want
any
hard
work
about
the
place
and
there
is
now
very
little
of
it
and
usually
it
so
works
out
that
adopting
the
way
which
is
easier
on
the
men
also
decreases
the
cost
there
is
most
intimate
connection
between
decency
and
good
business
we
also
investigate
down
to
the
last
decimal
whether
it
is
cheaper
to
make
or
to
buy
a
part
the
suggestions
come
from
everywhere
the
polish
workmen
seem
to
be
the
cleverest
of
all
of
the
foreigners
in
making
them
one
who
could
not
speak
english
indicated
that
if
the
tool
in
his
machine
were
set
at
a
different
angle
it
might
wear
longer
as
it
was
it
lasted
only
four
or
five
cuts
he
was
right
and
a
lot
of
money
was
saved
in
grinding
another
pole
running
a
drill
press
rigged
up
a
little
fixture
to
save
handling
the
part
after
drilling
that
was
adopted
generally
and
a
considerable
saving
resulted
the
men
often
try
out
little
attachments
of
their
own
because
concentrating
on
one
thing
they
can
if
they
have
a
mind
that
way
usually
devise
some
improvement
the
cleanliness
of
a
man
machine
also
although
cleaning
a
machine
is
no
part
of
his
duty
is
usually
an
indication
of
his
intelligence
here
are
some
of
the
suggestions
a
proposal
that
castings
be
taken
from
the
foundry
to
the
machine
shop
on
an
overhead
conveyor
saved
seventy
men
in
the
transport
division
there
used
to
be
seventeen
men
and
this
was
when
production
was
smaller
taking
the
burrs
off
gears
and
it
was
a
hard
nasty
job
a
man
roughly
sketched
a
special
machine
his
idea
was
worked
out
and
the
machine
built
now
four
men
have
several
times
the
output
of
the
seventeen
men
and
have
no
hard
work
at
all
to
do
changing
from
a
solid
to
a
welded
rod
in
one
part
of
the
chassis
effected
an
immediate
saving
of
about
one
half
million
a
year
on
a
smaller
than
the
production
making
certain
tubes
out
of
flat
sheets
instead
of
drawing
them
in
the
usual
way
effected
another
enormous
saving
the
old
method
of
making
a
certain
gear
comprised
four
operations
and
per
cent
of
the
steel
went
into
scrap
we
use
most
of
our
scrap
and
eventually
we
will
use
it
all
but
that
is
no
reason
for
not
cutting
down
on
scrap
the
mere
fact
that
all
waste
is
not
a
dead
loss
is
no
excuse
for
permitting
waste
one
of
the
workmen
devised
a
very
simple
new
method
for
making
this
gear
in
which
the
scrap
was
only
one
per
cent
again
the
camshaft
has
to
have
heat
treatment
in
order
to
make
the
surface
hard
the
cam
shafts
always
came
out
of
the
oven
somewhat
warped
and
even
back
in
we
employed
men
just
to
straighten
the
shafts
several
of
our
men
experimented
for
about
a
year
and
finally
worked
out
a
new
form
of
oven
in
which
the
shafts
could
not
warp
in
with
the
production
much
larger
than
in
we
employed
only
eight
men
in
the
whole
operation
and
then
there
is
the
pressing
to
take
away
the
necessity
for
skill
in
any
job
done
by
any
one
the
tool
hardener
was
an
expert
he
had
to
judge
the
heating
temperatures
it
was
a
operation
the
wonder
is
that
he
hit
so
often
the
heat
treatment
in
the
hardening
of
steel
is
highly
important
providing
one
knows
exactly
the
right
heat
to
apply
that
can
not
be
known
by
it
has
to
be
measured
we
introduced
a
system
by
which
the
man
at
the
furnace
has
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
heat
he
does
not
see
the
pyrometer
the
instrument
which
registers
the
temperature
coloured
electric
lights
give
him
his
signals
none
of
our
machines
is
ever
built
haphazardly
the
idea
is
investigated
in
detail
before
a
move
is
made
sometimes
wooden
models
are
constructed
or
again
the
parts
are
drawn
to
full
size
on
a
blackboard
we
are
not
bound
by
precedent
but
we
leave
nothing
to
luck
and
we
have
yet
to
build
a
machine
that
will
not
do
the
work
for
which
it
was
designed
about
ninety
per
cent
of
all
experiments
have
been
successful
whatever
expertness
in
fabrication
that
has
developed
has
been
due
to
men
i
think
that
if
men
are
unhampered
and
they
know
that
they
are
serving
they
will
always
put
all
of
mind
and
will
into
even
the
most
trivial
of
tasks
chapter
vii
the
terror
of
the
machine
repetitive
labour
the
doing
of
one
thing
over
and
over
again
and
always
in
the
same
way
is
a
terrifying
prospect
to
a
certain
kind
of
mind
it
is
terrifying
to
me
i
could
not
possibly
do
the
same
thing
day
in
and
day
out
but
to
other
minds
perhaps
i
might
say
to
the
majority
of
minds
repetitive
operations
hold
no
terrors
in
fact
to
some
types
of
mind
thought
is
absolutely
appalling
to
them
the
ideal
job
is
one
where
the
creative
instinct
need
not
be
expressed
the
jobs
where
it
is
necessary
to
put
in
mind
as
well
as
muscle
have
very
few
takers
we
always
need
men
who
like
a
job
because
it
is
difficult
the
average
worker
i
am
sorry
to
say
wants
a
job
in
which
he
does
not
have
to
put
forth
much
physical
exertion
above
all
he
wants
a
job
in
which
he
does
not
have
to
think
those
who
have
what
might
be
called
the
creative
type
of
mind
and
who
thoroughly
abhor
monotony
are
apt
to
imagine
that
all
other
minds
are
similarly
restless
and
therefore
to
extend
quite
unwanted
sympathy
to
the
labouring
man
who
day
in
and
day
out
performs
almost
exactly
the
same
operation
when
you
come
right
down
to
it
most
jobs
are
repetitive
a
business
man
has
a
routine
that
he
follows
with
great
exactness
the
work
of
a
bank
president
is
nearly
all
routine
the
work
of
under
officers
and
clerks
in
a
bank
is
purely
routine
indeed
for
most
purposes
and
most
people
it
is
necessary
to
establish
something
in
the
way
of
a
routine
and
to
make
most
motions
purely
repetitive
otherwise
the
individual
will
not
get
enough
done
to
be
able
to
live
off
his
own
exertions
there
is
no
reason
why
any
one
with
a
creative
mind
should
be
at
a
monotonous
job
for
everywhere
the
need
for
creative
men
is
pressing
there
will
never
be
a
dearth
of
places
for
skilled
people
but
we
have
to
recognize
that
the
will
to
be
skilled
is
not
general
and
even
if
the
will
be
present
then
the
courage
to
go
through
with
the
training
is
absent
one
can
not
become
skilled
by
mere
wishing
there
are
far
too
many
assumptions
about
what
human
nature
ought
to
be
and
not
enough
research
into
what
it
is
take
the
assumption
that
creative
work
can
be
undertaken
only
in
the
realm
of
vision
we
speak
of
creative
artists
in
music
painting
and
the
other
arts
we
seemingly
limit
the
creative
functions
to
productions
that
may
be
hung
on
gallery
walls
or
played
in
concert
halls
or
otherwise
displayed
where
idle
and
fastidious
people
gather
to
admire
each
other
culture
but
if
a
man
wants
a
field
for
vital
creative
work
let
him
come
where
he
is
dealing
with
higher
laws
than
those
of
sound
or
line
or
colour
let
him
come
where
he
may
deal
with
the
laws
of
personality
we
want
artists
in
industrial
relationship
we
want
masters
in
industrial
method
both
from
the
standpoint
of
the
producer
and
the
product
we
want
those
who
can
mould
the
political
social
industrial
and
moral
mass
into
a
sound
and
shapely
whole
we
have
limited
the
creative
faculty
too
much
and
have
used
it
for
too
trivial
ends
we
want
men
who
can
create
the
working
design
for
all
that
is
right
and
good
and
desirable
in
our
life
good
intentions
plus
working
designs
can
be
put
into
practice
and
can
be
made
to
succeed
it
is
possible
to
increase
the
of
the
workingman
not
by
having
him
do
less
work
but
by
aiding
him
to
do
more
if
the
world
will
give
its
attention
and
interest
and
energy
to
the
making
of
plans
that
will
profit
the
other
fellow
as
he
is
then
such
plans
can
be
established
on
a
practical
working
basis
such
plans
will
endure
and
they
will
be
far
the
most
profitable
both
in
human
and
financial
values
what
this
generation
needs
is
a
deep
faith
a
profound
conviction
in
the
practicability
of
righteousness
justice
and
humanity
in
industry
if
we
can
not
have
these
qualities
then
we
were
better
off
without
industry
indeed
if
we
can
not
get
those
qualities
the
days
of
industry
are
numbered
but
we
can
get
them
we
are
getting
them
if
a
man
can
not
earn
his
keep
without
the
aid
of
machinery
is
it
benefiting
him
to
withhold
that
machinery
because
attendance
upon
it
may
be
monotonous
and
let
him
starve
or
is
it
better
to
put
him
in
the
way
of
a
good
living
is
a
man
the
happier
for
starving
if
he
is
the
happier
for
using
a
machine
to
less
than
its
capacity
is
he
happier
for
producing
less
than
he
might
and
consequently
getting
less
than
his
share
of
the
world
goods
in
exchange
i
have
not
been
able
to
discover
that
repetitive
labour
injures
a
man
in
any
way
i
have
been
told
by
parlour
experts
that
repetitive
labour
is
soul
as
well
as
body
destroying
but
that
has
not
been
the
result
of
our
investigations
there
was
one
case
of
a
man
who
all
day
long
did
little
but
step
on
a
treadle
release
he
thought
that
the
motion
was
making
him
the
medical
examination
did
not
show
that
he
had
been
affected
but
of
course
he
was
changed
to
another
job
that
used
a
different
set
of
muscles
in
a
few
weeks
he
asked
for
his
old
job
again
it
would
seem
reasonable
to
imagine
that
going
through
the
same
set
of
motions
daily
for
eight
hours
would
produce
an
abnormal
body
but
we
have
never
had
a
case
of
it
we
shift
men
whenever
they
ask
to
be
shifted
and
we
should
like
regularly
to
change
them
that
would
be
entirely
feasible
if
only
the
men
would
have
it
that
way
they
do
not
like
changes
which
they
do
not
themselves
suggest
some
of
the
operations
are
undoubtedly
monotonous
so
monotonous
that
it
seems
scarcely
possible
that
any
man
would
care
to
continue
long
at
the
same
job
probably
the
most
monotonous
task
in
the
whole
factory
is
one
in
which
a
man
picks
up
a
gear
with
a
steel
hook
shakes
it
in
a
vat
of
oil
then
turns
it
into
a
basket
the
motion
never
varies
the
gears
come
to
him
always
in
exactly
the
same
place
he
gives
each
one
the
same
number
of
shakes
and
he
drops
it
into
a
basket
which
is
always
in
the
same
place
no
muscular
energy
is
required
no
intelligence
is
required
he
does
little
more
than
wave
his
hands
gently
to
and
fro
the
steel
rod
is
so
light
yet
the
man
on
that
job
has
been
doing
it
for
eight
solid
years
he
has
saved
and
invested
his
money
until
now
he
has
about
forty
thousand
dollars
and
he
stubbornly
resists
every
attempt
to
force
him
into
a
better
job
the
most
thorough
research
has
not
brought
out
a
single
case
of
a
mind
being
twisted
or
deadened
by
the
work
the
kind
of
mind
that
does
not
like
repetitive
work
does
not
have
to
stay
in
it
the
work
in
each
department
is
classified
according
to
its
desirability
and
skill
into
classes
a
b
and
c
each
class
having
anywhere
from
ten
to
thirty
different
operations
a
man
comes
directly
from
the
employment
office
to
class
as
he
gets
better
he
goes
into
class
b
and
so
on
into
class
a
and
out
of
class
a
into
tool
making
or
some
supervisory
capacity
it
is
up
to
him
to
place
himself
if
he
stays
in
production
it
is
because
he
likes
it
in
a
previous
chapter
i
noted
that
no
one
applying
for
work
is
refused
on
account
of
physical
condition
this
policy
went
into
effect
on
january
at
the
time
of
setting
the
minimum
wage
at
five
dollars
a
day
and
the
working
day
at
eight
hours
it
carried
with
it
the
further
condition
that
no
one
should
be
discharged
on
account
of
physical
condition
except
of
course
in
the
case
of
contagious
disease
i
think
that
if
an
industrial
institution
is
to
fill
its
whole
role
it
ought
to
be
possible
for
a
of
its
employees
to
show
about
the
same
proportions
as
a
of
a
society
in
general
we
have
always
with
us
the
maimed
and
the
halt
there
is
a
most
generous
disposition
to
regard
all
of
these
people
who
are
physically
incapacitated
for
labour
as
a
charge
on
society
and
to
support
them
by
charity
there
are
cases
where
i
imagine
that
the
support
must
be
by
charity
as
for
instance
an
idiot
but
those
cases
are
extraordinarily
rare
and
we
have
found
it
possible
among
the
great
number
of
different
tasks
that
must
be
performed
somewhere
in
the
company
to
find
an
opening
for
almost
any
one
and
on
the
basis
of
production
the
blind
man
or
cripple
can
in
the
particular
place
to
which
he
is
assigned
perform
just
as
much
work
and
receive
exactly
the
same
pay
as
a
wholly
man
would
we
do
not
prefer
cripples
but
we
have
demonstrated
that
they
can
earn
full
wages
it
would
be
quite
outside
the
spirit
of
what
we
are
trying
to
do
to
take
on
men
because
they
were
crippled
pay
them
a
lower
wage
and
be
content
with
a
lower
output
that
might
be
directly
helping
the
men
but
it
would
not
be
helping
them
in
the
best
way
the
best
way
is
always
the
way
by
which
they
can
be
put
on
a
productive
par
with
men
i
believe
that
there
is
very
little
occasion
for
charity
in
this
world
that
is
charity
in
the
sense
of
making
gifts
most
certainly
business
and
charity
can
not
be
combined
the
purpose
of
a
factory
is
to
produce
and
it
ill
serves
the
community
in
general
unless
it
does
produce
to
the
utmost
of
its
capacity
we
are
too
ready
to
assume
without
investigation
that
the
full
possession
of
faculties
is
a
condition
requisite
to
the
best
performance
of
all
jobs
to
discover
just
what
was
the
real
situation
i
had
all
of
the
different
jobs
in
the
factory
classified
to
the
kind
of
machine
and
work
whether
the
physical
labour
involved
was
light
medium
or
heavy
whether
it
were
a
wet
or
a
dry
job
and
if
not
with
what
kind
of
fluid
whether
it
were
clean
or
dirty
near
an
oven
or
a
furnace
the
condition
of
the
air
whether
one
or
both
hands
had
to
be
used
whether
the
employee
stood
or
sat
down
at
his
work
whether
it
was
noisy
or
quiet
whether
it
required
accuracy
whether
the
light
was
natural
or
artificial
the
number
of
pieces
that
had
to
be
handled
per
hour
the
weight
of
the
material
handled
and
the
description
of
the
strain
upon
the
worker
it
turned
out
at
the
time
of
the
inquiry
that
there
were
then
different
jobs
in
the
factory
of
these
were
classified
as
heavy
work
requiring
strong
and
practically
physically
perfect
men
required
men
of
ordinary
physical
development
and
strength
the
remaining
jobs
were
disclosed
as
requiring
no
physical
exertion
and
could
be
performed
by
the
slightest
weakest
sort
of
men
in
fact
most
of
them
could
be
satisfactorily
filled
by
women
or
older
children
the
lightest
jobs
were
again
classified
to
discover
how
many
of
them
required
the
use
of
full
faculties
and
we
found
that
could
be
filled
by
legless
men
by
men
by
armless
men
by
men
and
by
blind
men
therefore
out
of
kinds
of
jobs
although
some
of
them
required
strength
did
not
require
full
physical
capacity
that
is
developed
industry
can
provide
wage
work
for
a
higher
average
of
standard
men
than
are
ordinarily
included
in
any
normal
community
if
the
jobs
in
any
one
industry
or
say
any
one
factory
were
analyzed
as
ours
have
been
analyzed
the
proportion
might
be
very
different
yet
i
am
quite
sure
that
if
work
is
sufficiently
subdivided
subdivided
to
the
point
of
highest
economy
there
will
be
no
dearth
of
places
in
which
the
physically
incapacitated
can
do
a
man
job
and
get
a
man
wage
it
is
economically
most
wasteful
to
accept
crippled
men
as
charges
and
then
to
teach
them
trivial
tasks
like
the
weaving
of
baskets
or
some
other
form
of
unremunerative
hand
labour
in
the
hope
not
of
aiding
them
to
make
a
living
but
of
preventing
despondency
when
a
man
is
taken
on
by
the
employment
department
the
theory
is
to
put
him
into
a
job
suited
to
his
condition
if
he
is
already
at
work
and
he
does
not
seem
able
to
perform
the
work
or
if
he
does
not
like
his
work
he
is
given
a
transfer
card
which
he
takes
up
to
the
transfer
department
and
after
an
examination
he
is
tried
out
in
some
other
work
more
suited
to
his
condition
or
disposition
those
who
are
below
the
ordinary
physical
standards
are
just
as
good
workers
rightly
placed
as
those
who
are
above
for
instance
a
blind
man
was
assigned
to
the
stock
department
to
count
bolts
and
nuts
for
shipment
to
branch
establishments
two
other
men
were
already
employed
on
this
work
in
two
days
the
foreman
sent
a
note
to
the
transfer
department
releasing
the
men
because
the
blind
man
was
able
to
do
not
only
his
own
work
but
also
the
work
that
had
formerly
been
done
by
the
sound
men
this
salvage
can
be
carried
further
it
is
usually
taken
for
granted
that
when
a
man
is
injured
he
is
simply
out
of
the
running
and
should
be
paid
an
allowance
but
there
is
always
a
period
of
convalescence
especially
in
fracture
cases
where
the
man
is
strong
enough
to
work
and
indeed
by
that
time
usually
anxious
to
work
for
the
largest
possible
accident
allowance
can
never
be
as
great
as
a
man
wage
if
it
were
then
a
business
would
simply
have
an
additional
tax
put
upon
it
and
that
tax
would
show
up
in
the
cost
of
the
product
there
would
be
less
buying
of
the
product
and
therefore
less
work
for
somebody
that
is
an
inevitable
sequence
that
must
always
be
borne
in
mind
we
have
experimented
with
bedridden
men
men
who
were
able
to
sit
up
we
put
black
oilcloth
covers
or
aprons
over
the
beds
and
set
the
men
to
work
screwing
nuts
on
small
bolts
this
is
a
job
that
has
to
be
done
by
hand
and
on
which
fifteen
or
twenty
men
are
kept
busy
in
the
magneto
department
the
men
in
the
hospital
could
do
it
just
as
well
as
the
men
in
the
shop
and
they
were
able
to
receive
their
regular
wages
in
fact
their
production
was
about
per
i
believe
above
the
usual
shop
production
no
man
had
to
do
the
work
unless
he
wanted
to
but
they
all
wanted
to
it
kept
time
from
hanging
on
their
hands
they
slept
and
ate
better
and
recovered
more
rapidly
no
particular
consideration
has
to
be
given
to
employees
they
do
their
work
one
hundred
per
cent
the
tubercular
employees
and
there
are
usually
about
a
thousand
of
them
mostly
work
in
the
material
salvage
department
those
cases
which
are
considered
contagious
work
together
in
an
especially
constructed
shed
the
work
of
all
of
them
is
largely
out
of
doors
at
the
time
of
the
last
analysis
of
employed
there
were
men
of
these
had
crippled
or
amputated
arms
forearms
or
hands
one
had
both
hands
off
there
were
totally
blind
men
blind
in
one
eye
with
one
eye
nearly
blind
deaf
and
dumb
epileptics
with
both
legs
or
feet
missing
with
one
foot
or
leg
missing
the
others
had
minor
impediments
the
length
of
time
required
to
become
proficient
in
the
various
occupations
is
about
as
follows
per
cent
of
all
the
jobs
require
not
over
one
day
of
training
per
cent
require
from
one
day
to
one
week
per
cent
require
from
one
to
two
weeks
per
cent
require
from
one
month
to
one
year
one
per
cent
require
from
one
to
six
years
the
last
jobs
require
great
skill
as
in
tool
making
and
die
sinking
the
discipline
throughout
the
plant
is
rigid
there
are
no
petty
rules
and
no
rules
the
justice
of
which
can
reasonably
be
disputed
the
injustice
of
arbitrary
discharge
is
avoided
by
confining
the
right
of
discharge
to
the
employment
manager
and
he
rarely
exercises
it
the
year
is
the
last
on
which
statistics
were
kept
in
that
year
changes
occurred
of
those
were
absent
more
than
ten
days
without
notice
and
therefore
dropped
because
they
refused
the
job
assigned
or
without
giving
cause
demanded
a
transfer
were
let
go
a
refusal
to
learn
english
in
the
school
provided
accounted
for
more
enlisted
about
were
transferred
to
other
plants
going
home
going
into
farming
or
business
accounted
for
about
the
same
number
women
were
discharged
because
their
husbands
were
working
we
do
not
employ
married
women
whose
husbands
have
jobs
out
of
the
whole
lot
only
were
flatly
discharged
and
the
causes
were
misrepresentation
by
order
of
educational
department
and
undesirable
we
expect
the
men
to
do
what
they
are
told
the
organization
is
so
highly
specialized
and
one
part
is
so
dependent
upon
another
that
we
could
not
for
a
moment
consider
allowing
men
to
have
their
own
way
without
the
most
rigid
discipline
we
would
have
the
utmost
confusion
i
think
it
should
not
be
otherwise
in
industry
the
men
are
there
to
get
the
greatest
possible
amount
of
work
done
and
to
receive
the
highest
possible
pay
if
each
man
were
permitted
to
act
in
his
own
way
production
would
suffer
and
therefore
pay
would
suffer
any
one
who
does
not
like
to
work
in
our
way
may
always
leave
the
company
conduct
toward
the
men
is
meant
to
be
exact
and
impartial
it
is
naturally
to
the
interest
both
of
the
foremen
and
of
the
department
heads
that
the
releases
from
their
departments
should
be
few
the
workman
has
a
full
chance
to
tell
his
story
if
he
has
been
unjustly
treated
he
has
full
recourse
of
course
it
is
inevitable
that
injustices
occur
men
are
not
always
fair
with
their
fellow
workmen
defective
human
nature
obstructs
our
good
intentions
now
and
then
the
foreman
does
not
always
get
the
idea
or
misapplies
it
but
the
company
intentions
are
as
i
have
stated
and
we
use
every
means
to
have
them
understood
it
is
necessary
to
be
most
insistent
in
the
matter
of
absences
a
man
may
not
come
or
go
as
he
pleases
he
may
always
apply
for
leave
to
the
foreman
but
if
he
leaves
without
notice
then
on
his
return
the
reasons
for
his
absence
are
carefully
investigated
and
are
sometimes
referred
to
the
medical
department
if
his
reasons
are
good
he
is
permitted
to
resume
work
if
they
are
not
good
he
may
be
discharged
in
hiring
a
man
the
only
data
taken
concerns
his
name
his
address
his
age
whether
he
is
married
or
single
the
number
of
his
dependents
whether
he
has
ever
worked
for
the
ford
motor
company
and
the
condition
of
his
sight
and
his
hearing
no
questions
are
asked
concerning
what
the
man
has
previously
done
but
we
have
what
we
call
the
better
advantage
notice
by
which
a
man
who
has
had
a
trade
before
he
came
to
us
files
a
notice
with
the
employment
department
stating
what
the
trade
was
in
this
way
when
we
need
specialists
of
any
kind
we
can
get
them
right
out
of
production
this
is
also
one
of
the
avenues
by
which
tool
makers
and
moulders
quickly
reach
the
higher
positions
i
once
wanted
a
swiss
watch
maker
the
cards
turned
one
up
he
was
running
a
drill
press
the
heat
treat
department
wanted
a
skilled
firebrick
layer
he
also
was
found
on
a
drill
press
he
is
now
a
general
inspector
there
is
not
much
personal
contact
the
men
do
their
work
and
go
home
a
factory
is
not
a
drawing
room
but
we
try
to
have
justice
and
while
there
may
be
little
in
the
way
of
hand
shaking
we
have
no
professional
hand
shakers
also
we
try
to
prevent
opportunity
for
petty
personalities
we
have
so
many
departments
that
the
place
is
almost
a
world
in
itself
every
kind
of
man
can
find
a
place
somewhere
in
it
take
fighting
between
men
men
will
fight
and
usually
fighting
is
a
cause
for
discharge
on
the
spot
we
find
that
does
not
help
the
fighters
it
merely
gets
them
out
of
our
sight
so
the
foremen
have
become
rather
ingenious
in
devising
punishments
that
will
not
take
anything
away
from
the
man
family
and
which
require
no
time
at
all
to
administer
one
point
that
is
absolutely
essential
to
high
capacity
as
well
as
to
humane
production
is
a
clean
and
factory
our
machines
are
placed
very
close
together
every
foot
of
floor
space
in
the
factory
carries
of
course
the
same
overhead
charge
the
consumer
must
pay
the
extra
overhead
and
the
extra
transportation
involved
in
having
machines
even
six
inches
farther
apart
than
they
have
to
be
we
measure
on
each
job
the
exact
amount
of
room
that
a
man
needs
he
must
not
be
cramped
that
would
be
waste
but
if
he
and
his
machine
occupy
more
space
than
is
required
that
also
is
waste
this
brings
our
machines
closer
together
than
in
probably
any
other
factory
in
the
world
to
a
stranger
they
may
seem
piled
right
on
top
of
one
another
but
they
are
scientifically
arranged
not
only
in
the
sequence
of
operations
but
to
give
every
man
and
every
machine
every
square
inch
that
he
requires
and
if
possible
not
a
square
inch
and
certainly
not
a
square
foot
more
than
he
requires
our
factory
buildings
are
not
intended
to
be
used
as
parks
the
close
placing
requires
a
maximum
of
safeguards
and
ventilation
machine
safeguarding
is
a
subject
all
of
itself
we
do
not
consider
any
machine
no
matter
how
efficiently
it
may
turn
out
its
work
as
a
proper
machine
unless
it
is
absolutely
safe
we
have
no
machines
that
we
consider
unsafe
but
even
at
that
a
few
accidents
will
happen
every
accident
no
matter
how
trivial
is
traced
back
by
a
skilled
man
employed
solely
for
that
purpose
and
a
study
is
made
of
the
machine
to
make
that
same
accident
in
the
future
impossible
when
we
put
up
the
older
buildings
we
did
not
understand
so
much
about
ventilation
as
we
do
in
all
the
later
buildings
the
supporting
columns
are
made
hollow
and
through
them
the
bad
air
is
pumped
out
and
the
good
air
introduced
a
nearly
even
temperature
is
kept
everywhere
the
year
round
and
during
daylight
there
is
nowhere
the
necessity
for
artificial
light
something
like
seven
hundred
men
are
detailed
exclusively
to
keeping
the
shops
clean
the
windows
washed
and
all
of
the
paint
fresh
the
dark
corners
which
invite
expectoration
are
painted
white
one
can
not
have
morale
without
cleanliness
we
tolerate
makeshift
cleanliness
no
more
than
makeshift
methods
no
reason
exists
why
factory
work
should
be
dangerous
if
a
man
has
worked
too
hard
or
through
too
long
hours
he
gets
into
a
mental
state
that
invites
accidents
part
of
the
work
of
preventing
accidents
is
to
avoid
this
mental
state
part
is
to
prevent
carelessness
and
part
is
to
make
machinery
absolutely
the
principal
causes
of
accidents
as
they
are
grouped
by
the
experts
are
defective
structures
defective
machines
insufficient
room
absence
of
safeguards
unclean
conditions
bad
lights
bad
air
unsuitable
clothing
carelessness
ignorance
mental
condition
lack
of
cooperation
the
questions
of
defective
structures
defective
machinery
insufficient
room
unclean
conditions
bad
light
bad
air
the
wrong
mental
condition
and
the
lack
of
cooperation
are
easily
disposed
of
none
of
the
men
work
too
hard
the
wages
settle
nine
tenths
of
the
mental
problems
and
construction
gets
rid
of
the
others
we
have
then
to
guard
against
unsuitable
clothing
carelessness
and
ignorance
and
to
make
everything
we
have
this
is
more
difficult
where
we
have
belts
in
all
of
our
new
construction
each
machine
has
its
individual
electric
motor
but
in
the
older
construction
we
had
to
use
belts
every
belt
is
guarded
over
the
automatic
conveyors
are
placed
bridges
so
that
no
man
has
to
cross
at
a
dangerous
point
wherever
there
is
a
possibility
of
flying
metal
the
workman
is
required
to
wear
goggles
and
the
chances
are
further
reduced
by

chapter
viii
wages
there
is
nothing
to
running
a
business
by
custom
to
saying
i
pay
the
going
rate
of
wages
the
same
man
would
not
so
easily
say
i
have
nothing
better
or
cheaper
to
sell
than
any
one
has
no
manufacturer
in
his
right
mind
would
contend
that
buying
only
the
cheapest
materials
is
the
way
to
make
certain
of
manufacturing
the
best
article
then
why
do
we
hear
so
much
talk
about
the
liquidation
of
labour
and
the
benefits
that
will
flow
to
the
country
from
cutting
wages
which
means
only
the
cutting
of
buying
power
and
the
curtailing
of
the
home
market
what
good
is
industry
if
it
be
so
unskillfully
managed
as
not
to
return
a
living
to
everyone
concerned
no
question
is
more
important
than
that
of
wages
most
of
the
people
of
the
country
live
on
wages
the
scale
of
their
living
the
rate
of
their
wages
determines
the
prosperity
of
the
country
throughout
all
the
ford
industries
we
now
have
a
minimum
wage
of
six
dollars
a
day
we
used
to
have
a
minimum
of
five
dollars
before
that
we
paid
whatever
it
was
necessary
to
pay
it
would
be
bad
morals
to
go
back
to
the
old
market
rate
of
paying
but
also
it
would
be
the
worst
sort
of
bad
business
first
get
at
the
relationships
it
is
not
usual
to
speak
of
an
employee
as
a
partner
and
yet
what
else
is
he
whenever
a
man
finds
the
management
of
a
business
too
much
for
his
own
time
or
strength
he
calls
in
assistants
to
share
the
management
with
him
why
then
if
a
man
finds
the
production
part
of
a
business
too
much
for
his
own
two
hands
should
he
deny
the
title
of
partner
to
those
who
come
in
and
help
him
produce
every
business
that
employs
more
than
one
man
is
a
kind
of
partnership
the
moment
a
man
calls
for
assistance
in
his
business
even
though
the
assistant
be
but
a
boy
that
moment
he
has
taken
a
partner
he
may
himself
be
sole
owner
of
the
resources
of
the
business
and
sole
director
of
its
operations
but
only
while
he
remains
sole
manager
and
sole
producer
can
he
claim
complete
independence
no
man
is
independent
as
long
as
he
has
to
depend
on
another
man
to
help
him
it
is
a
reciprocal
relation
the
boss
is
the
partner
of
his
worker
the
worker
is
partner
of
his
boss
and
such
being
the
case
it
is
useless
for
one
group
or
the
other
to
assume
that
it
is
the
one
indispensable
unit
both
are
indispensable
the
one
can
become
unduly
assertive
only
at
the
expense
of
the
other
and
eventually
at
its
own
expense
as
well
it
is
utterly
foolish
for
capital
or
for
labour
to
think
of
themselves
as
groups
they
are
partners
when
they
pull
and
haul
against
each
other
they
simply
injure
the
organization
in
which
they
are
partners
and
from
which
both
draw
support
it
ought
to
be
the
employer
ambition
as
leader
to
pay
better
wages
than
any
similar
line
of
business
and
it
ought
to
be
the
ambition
to
make
this
possible
of
course
there
are
men
in
all
shops
who
seem
to
believe
that
if
they
do
their
best
it
will
be
only
for
the
employer
benefit
and
not
at
all
for
their
own
it
is
a
pity
that
such
a
feeling
should
exist
but
it
does
exist
and
perhaps
it
has
some
justification
if
an
employer
urges
men
to
do
their
best
and
the
men
learn
after
a
while
that
their
best
does
not
bring
any
reward
then
they
naturally
drop
back
into
getting
by
but
if
they
see
the
fruits
of
hard
work
in
their
pay
envelope
proof
that
harder
work
means
higher
pay
then
also
they
begin
to
learn
that
they
are
a
part
of
the
business
and
that
its
success
depends
on
them
and
their
success
depends
on
it
what
ought
the
employer
to
pay
what
ought
the
employee
to
receive
these
are
but
minor
questions
the
basic
question
is
what
can
the
business
stand
certainly
no
business
can
stand
outgo
that
exceeds
its
income
when
you
pump
water
out
of
a
well
at
a
faster
rate
than
the
water
flows
in
the
well
goes
dry
and
when
the
well
runs
dry
those
who
depend
on
it
go
thirsty
and
if
perchance
they
imagine
they
can
pump
one
well
dry
and
then
jump
to
some
other
well
it
is
only
a
matter
of
time
when
all
the
wells
will
be
dry
there
is
now
a
widespread
demand
for
more
justly
divided
rewards
but
it
must
be
recognized
that
there
are
limits
to
rewards
the
business
itself
sets
the
limits
you
can
not
distribute
out
of
a
business
that
brings
in
only
the
business
limits
the
wages
but
does
anything
limit
the
business
the
business
limits
itself
by
following
bad
precedents
if
men
instead
of
saying
the
employer
ought
to
do
would
say
the
business
ought
to
be
so
stimulated
and
managed
that
it
can
do
they
would
get
somewhere
because
only
the
business
can
pay
wages
certainly
the
employer
can
not
unless
the
business
warrants
but
if
that
business
does
warrant
higher
wages
and
the
employer
refuses
what
is
to
be
done
as
a
rule
a
business
means
the
livelihood
of
too
many
men
to
be
tampered
with
it
is
criminal
to
assassinate
a
business
to
which
large
numbers
of
men
have
given
their
labours
and
to
which
they
have
learned
to
look
as
their
field
of
usefulness
and
their
source
of
livelihood
killing
the
business
by
a
strike
or
a
lockout
does
not
help
the
employer
can
gain
nothing
by
looking
over
the
employees
and
asking
himself
how
little
can
i
get
them
to
take
nor
the
employee
by
glaring
back
and
asking
how
much
can
i
force
him
to
give
eventually
both
will
have
to
turn
to
the
business
and
ask
how
can
this
industry
be
made
safe
and
profitable
so
that
it
will
be
able
to
provide
a
sure
and
comfortable
living
for
all
of
us
but
by
no
means
all
employers
or
all
employees
will
think
straight
the
habit
of
acting
shortsightedly
is
a
hard
one
to
break
what
can
be
done
nothing
no
rules
or
laws
will
effect
the
changes
but
enlightened
will
it
takes
a
little
while
for
enlightenment
to
spread
but
spread
it
must
for
the
concern
in
which
both
employer
and
employees
work
to
the
same
end
of
service
is
bound
to
forge
ahead
in
business
what
do
we
mean
by
high
wages
anyway
we
mean
a
higher
wage
than
was
paid
ten
months
or
ten
years
ago
we
do
not
mean
a
higher
wage
than
ought
to
be
paid
our
high
wages
of
may
be
low
wages
ten
years
from
now
if
it
is
right
for
the
manager
of
a
business
to
try
to
make
it
pay
larger
dividends
it
is
quite
as
right
that
he
should
try
to
make
it
pay
higher
wages
but
it
is
not
the
manager
of
the
business
who
pays
the
high
wages
of
course
if
he
can
and
will
not
then
the
blame
is
on
him
but
he
alone
can
never
make
high
wages
possible
high
wages
can
not
be
paid
unless
the
workmen
earn
them
their
labour
is
the
productive
factor
it
is
not
the
only
productive
factor
poor
management
can
waste
labour
and
material
and
nullify
the
efforts
of
labour
labour
can
nullify
the
results
of
good
management
but
in
a
partnership
of
skilled
management
and
honest
labour
it
is
the
workman
who
makes
high
wages
possible
he
invests
his
energy
and
skill
and
if
he
makes
an
honest
wholehearted
investment
high
wages
ought
to
be
his
reward
not
only
has
he
earned
them
but
he
has
had
a
big
part
in
creating
them
it
ought
to
be
clear
however
that
the
high
wage
begins
down
in
the
shop
if
it
is
not
created
there
it
can
not
get
into
pay
envelopes
there
will
never
be
a
system
invented
which
will
do
away
with
the
necessity
of
work
nature
has
seen
to
that
idle
hands
and
minds
were
never
intended
for
any
one
of
us
work
is
our
sanity
our
our
salvation
so
far
from
being
a
curse
work
is
the
greatest
blessing
exact
social
justice
flows
only
out
of
honest
work
the
man
who
contributes
much
should
take
away
much
therefore
no
element
of
charity
is
present
in
the
paying
of
wages
the
kind
of
workman
who
gives
the
business
the
best
that
is
in
him
is
the
best
kind
of
workman
a
business
can
have
and
he
can
not
be
expected
to
do
this
indefinitely
without
proper
recognition
of
his
contribution
the
man
who
comes
to
the
day
job
feeling
that
no
matter
how
much
he
may
give
it
will
not
yield
him
enough
of
a
return
to
keep
him
beyond
want
is
not
in
shape
to
do
his
day
work
he
is
anxious
and
worried
and
it
all
reacts
to
the
detriment
of
his
work
but
if
a
man
feels
that
his
day
work
is
not
only
supplying
his
basic
need
but
is
also
giving
him
a
margin
of
comfort
and
enabling
him
to
give
his
boys
and
girls
their
opportunity
and
his
wife
some
pleasure
in
life
then
his
job
looks
good
to
him
and
he
is
free
to
give
it
of
his
best
this
is
a
good
thing
for
him
and
a
good
thing
for
the
business
the
man
who
does
not
get
a
certain
satisfaction
out
of
his
day
work
is
losing
the
best
part
of
his
pay
for
the
day
work
is
a
great
thing
a
very
great
thing
it
is
at
the
very
foundation
of
the
world
it
is
the
basis
of
our
and
the
employer
ought
constantly
to
put
in
a
harder
day
work
than
any
of
his
men
the
employer
who
is
seriously
trying
to
do
his
duty
in
the
world
must
be
a
hard
worker
he
can
not
say
i
have
so
many
thousand
men
working
for
me
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
so
many
thousand
men
have
him
working
for
them
and
the
better
they
work
the
busier
they
keep
him
disposing
of
their
products
wages
and
salaries
are
in
fixed
amounts
and
this
must
be
so
in
order
to
have
a
basis
to
figure
on
wages
and
salaries
are
a
sort
of
fixed
in
advance
but
it
often
happens
that
when
the
business
of
the
year
is
closed
it
is
discovered
that
more
can
be
paid
and
then
more
ought
to
be
paid
when
we
are
all
in
the
business
working
together
we
all
ought
to
have
some
share
in
the
profits
by
way
of
a
good
wage
or
salary
or
added
compensation
and
that
is
beginning
now
quite
generally
to
be
recognized
there
is
now
a
definite
demand
that
the
human
side
of
business
be
elevated
to
a
position
of
equal
importance
with
the
material
side
and
that
is
going
to
come
about
it
is
just
a
question
whether
it
is
going
to
be
brought
about
wisely
in
a
way
that
will
conserve
the
material
side
which
now
sustains
us
or
unwisely
and
in
such
a
way
as
shall
take
from
us
all
the
benefit
of
the
work
of
the
past
years
business
represents
our
national
livelihood
it
reflects
our
economic
progress
and
gives
us
our
place
among
other
nations
we
do
not
want
to
jeopardize
that
what
we
want
is
a
better
recognition
of
the
human
element
in
business
and
surely
it
can
be
achieved
without
dislocation
without
loss
to
any
one
indeed
with
an
increase
of
benefit
to
every
human
being
and
the
secret
of
it
all
is
in
a
recognition
of
human
partnership
until
each
man
is
absolutely
sufficient
unto
himself
needing
the
services
of
no
other
human
being
in
any
capacity
whatever
we
shall
never
get
beyond
the
need
of
partnership
such
are
the
fundamental
truths
of
wages
they
are
partnership
distributions
when
can
a
wage
be
considered
adequate
how
much
of
a
living
is
reasonably
to
be
expected
from
work
have
you
ever
considered
what
a
wage
does
or
ought
to
do
to
say
that
it
should
pay
the
cost
of
living
is
to
say
almost
nothing
the
cost
of
living
depends
largely
upon
the
efficiency
of
production
and
transportation
and
the
efficiency
of
these
is
the
sum
of
the
efficiencies
of
the
management
and
the
workers
good
work
well
managed
ought
to
result
in
high
wages
and
low
living
costs
if
we
attempt
to
regulate
wages
on
living
costs
we
get
nowhere
the
cost
of
living
is
a
result
and
we
can
not
expect
to
keep
a
result
constant
if
we
keep
altering
the
factors
which
produce
the
result
when
we
try
to
regulate
wages
according
to
the
cost
of
living
we
are
imitating
a
dog
chasing
his
tail
and
anyhow
who
is
competent
to
say
just
what
kind
of
living
we
shall
base
the
costs
on
let
us
broaden
our
view
and
see
what
a
wage
is
to
the
workmen
and
what
it
ought
to
be
the
wage
carries
all
the
worker
obligations
outside
the
shop
it
carries
all
that
is
necessary
in
the
way
of
service
and
management
inside
the
shop
the
day
productive
work
is
the
most
valuable
mine
of
wealth
that
has
ever
been
opened
certainly
it
ought
to
bear
not
less
than
all
the
worker
outside
obligations
and
certainly
it
ought
to
be
made
to
take
care
of
the
worker
sunset
days
when
labour
is
no
longer
possible
to
him
and
should
be
no
longer
necessary
and
if
it
is
made
to
do
even
these
industry
will
have
to
be
adjusted
to
a
schedule
of
production
distribution
and
reward
which
will
stop
the
leaks
into
the
pockets
of
men
who
do
not
assist
in
production
in
order
to
create
a
system
which
shall
be
as
independent
of
the
of
benevolent
employers
as
of
the
of
selfish
ones
we
shall
have
to
find
a
basis
in
the
actual
facts
of
life
itself
it
costs
just
as
much
physical
strength
to
turn
out
a
day
work
when
wheat
is
a
bushel
as
when
wheat
is
a
bushel
eggs
may
be
cents
a
dozen
or
cents
a
dozen
what
difference
does
it
make
in
the
units
of
energy
a
man
uses
in
a
productive
day
work
if
only
the
man
himself
were
concerned
the
cost
of
his
maintenance
and
the
profit
he
ought
to
have
would
be
a
simple
matter
but
he
is
not
just
an
individual
he
is
a
citizen
contributing
to
the
welfare
of
the
nation
he
is
a
householder
he
is
perhaps
a
father
with
children
who
must
be
reared
to
usefulness
on
what
he
is
able
to
earn
we
must
reckon
with
all
these
facts
how
are
you
going
to
figure
the
contribution
of
the
home
to
the
day
work
you
pay
the
man
for
his
work
but
how
much
does
that
work
owe
to
his
home
how
much
to
his
position
as
a
citizen
how
much
to
his
position
as
a
father
the
man
does
the
work
in
the
shop
but
his
wife
does
the
work
in
the
home
the
shop
must
pay
them
both
on
what
system
of
figuring
is
the
home
going
to
find
its
place
on
the
cost
sheets
of
the
day
work
is
the
man
own
livelihood
to
be
regarded
as
the
cost
and
is
his
ability
to
have
a
home
and

the
profit
is
the
profit
on
a
day
work
to
be
computed
on
a
cash
basis
only
measured
by
the
amount
a
man
has
left
over
after
his
own
and
his
family
wants
are
all
supplied
or
are
all
these
relationships
to
be
considered
strictly
under
head
of
cost
and
the
profit
to
be
computed
entirely
outside
of
them
that
is
after
having
supported
himself
and
family
clothed
them
housed
them
educated
them
given
them
the
privileges
incident
to
their
standard
of
living
ought
there
to
be
provision
made
for
still
something
more
in
the
way
of
savings
profit
and
are
all
properly
chargeable
to
the
day
work
i
think
they
are
otherwise
we
have
the
hideous
prospect
of
little
children
and
their
mothers
being
forced
out
to
work
these
are
questions
which
call
for
accurate
observation
and
computation
perhaps
there
is
no
one
item
connected
with
our
economic
life
that
would
surprise
us
more
than
a
knowledge
of
just
what
burdens
the
day
work
it
is
perhaps
possible
accurately
to
determine
albeit
with
considerable
interference
with
the
day
work
itself
how
much
energy
the
day
work
takes
out
of
a
man
but
it
is
not
at
all
possible
accurately
to
determine
how
much
it
will
require
to
put
back
that
energy
into
him
against
the
next
day
demands
nor
is
it
possible
to
determine
how
much
of
that
expended
energy
he
will
never
be
able
to
get
back
at
all
economics
has
never
yet
devised
a
sinking
fund
for
the
replacement
of
the
strength
of
a
worker
it
is
possible
to
set
up
a
kind
of
sinking
fund
in
the
form
of
pensions
but
pensions
do
not
attend
to
the
profit
which
each
day
labour
ought
to
yield
in
order
to
take
care
of
all
of
life
overhead
of
all
physical
losses
and
of
the
inevitable
deterioration
of
the
manual
worker
the
best
wages
that
have
up
to
date
ever
been
paid
are
not
nearly
as
high
as
they
ought
to
be
business
is
not
yet
sufficiently
well
organized
and
its
objectives
are
not
yet
sufficiently
clear
to
make
it
possible
to
pay
more
than
a
fraction
of
the
wages
that
ought
to
be
paid
that
is
part
of
the
work
we
have
before
us
it
does
not
help
toward
a
solution
to
talk
about
abolishing
the
wage
system
and
substituting
communal
ownership
the
wage
system
is
the
only
one
that
we
have
under
which
contributions
to
production
can
be
rewarded
according
to
their
worth
take
away
the
wage
measure
and
we
shall
have
universal
injustice
perfect
the
system
and
we
may
have
universal
justice
i
have
learned
through
the
years
a
good
deal
about
wages
i
believe
in
the
first
place
that
all
other
considerations
aside
our
own
sales
depend
in
a
measure
upon
the
wages
we
pay
if
we
can
distribute
high
wages
then
that
money
is
going
to
be
spent
and
it
will
serve
to
make
storekeepers
and
distributors
and
manufacturers
and
workers
in
other
lines
more
prosperous
and
their
prosperity
will
be
reflected
in
our
sales
high
wages
spell
prosperity
provided
however
the
higher
wages
are
paid
for
higher
production
paying
high
wages
and
lowering
production
is
starting
down
the
incline
toward
dull
business
it
took
us
some
time
to
get
our
bearings
on
wages
and
it
was
not
until
we
had
gone
thoroughly
into
production
on
model
t
that
it
was
possible
to
figure
out
what
wages
ought
to
be
before
then
we
had
had
some
profit
sharing
we
had
at
the
end
of
each
year
for
some
years
past
divided
a
percentage
of
our
earnings
with
the
employees
for
instance
as
long
ago
as
we
distributed
eighty
thousand
dollars
on
the
basis
of
years
of
service
a
man
received
per
cent
of
his
year
wages
a
man
per
and
a
man
per
cent
the
objection
to
that
plan
was
that
it
had
no
direct
connection
with
the
day
work
a
man
did
not
get
his
share
until
long
after
his
work
was
done
and
then
it
came
to
him
almost
in
the
way
of
a
present
it
is
always
unfortunate
to
have
wages
tinged
with
charity
and
then
too
the
wages
were
not
scientifically
adjusted
to
the
jobs
the
man
in
job
a
might
get
one
rate
and
the
man
in
job
b
a
higher
rate
while
as
a
matter
of
fact
job
a
might
require
more
skill
or
exertion
than
job
b
a
great
deal
of
inequity
creeps
into
wage
rates
unless
both
the
employer
and
the
employee
know
that
the
rate
paid
has
been
arrived
at
by
something
better
than
a
guess
therefore
starting
about
we
had
time
studies
made
of
all
the
thousands
of
operations
in
the
shops
by
a
time
study
it
is
possible
theoretically
to
determine
what
a
man
output
should
be
then
making
large
allowances
it
is
further
possible
to
get
at
a
satisfactory
standard
output
for
a
day
and
taking
into
consideration
the
skill
to
arrive
at
a
rate
which
will
express
with
fair
accuracy
the
amount
of
skill
and
exertion
that
goes
into
a
job
and
how
much
is
to
be
expected
from
the
man
in
the
job
in
return
for
the
wage
without
scientific
study
the
employer
does
not
know
why
he
is
paying
a
wage
and
the
worker
does
not
know
why
he
is
getting
it
on
the
time
figures
all
of
the
jobs
in
our
factory
were
standardized
and
rates
set
we
do
not
have
piece
work
some
of
the
men
are
paid
by
the
day
and
some
are
paid
by
the
hour
but
in
practically
every
case
there
is
a
required
standard
output
below
which
a
man
is
not
expected
to
fall
were
it
otherwise
neither
the
workman
nor
ourselves
would
know
whether
or
not
wages
were
being
earned
there
must
be
a
fixed
day
work
before
a
real
wage
can
be
paid
watchmen
are
paid
for
presence
workmen
are
paid
for
work
having
these
facts
in
hand
we
announced
and
put
into
operation
in
january
a
kind
of
plan
in
which
the
minimum
wage
for
any
class
of
work
and
under
certain
conditions
was
five
dollars
a
day
at
the
same
time
we
reduced
the
working
day
to
eight
hours
it
had
been
nine
and
the
week
to
hours
this
was
entirely
a
voluntary
act
all
of
our
wage
rates
have
been
voluntary
it
was
to
our
way
of
thinking
an
act
of
social
justice
and
in
the
last
analysis
we
did
it
for
our
own
satisfaction
of
mind
there
is
a
pleasure
in
feeling
that
you
have
made
others
happy
that
you
have
lessened
in
some
degree
the
burdens
of
your
that
you
have
provided
a
margin
out
of
which
may
be
had
pleasure
and
saving
is
one
of
the
few
really
important
assets
of
life
a
determined
man
can
win
almost
anything
that
he
goes
after
but
unless
in
his
getting
he
gains
good
will
he
has
not
profited
much
there
was
however
no
charity
in
any
way
involved
that
was
not
generally
understood
many
employers
thought
we
were
just
making
the
announcement
because
we
were
prosperous
and
wanted
advertising
and
they
condemned
us
because
we
were
upsetting
standards
violating
the
custom
of
paying
a
man
the
smallest
amount
he
would
take
there
is
nothing
to
such
standards
and
customs
they
have
to
be
wiped
out
some
day
they
will
be
otherwise
we
can
not
abolish
poverty
we
made
the
change
not
merely
because
we
wanted
to
pay
higher
wages
and
thought
we
could
pay
them
we
wanted
to
pay
these
wages
so
that
the
business
would
be
on
a
lasting
foundation
we
were
not
distributing
anything
we
were
building
for
the
future
a
low
wage
business
is
always
insecure
probably
few
industrial
announcements
have
created
a
more
comment
than
did
this
one
and
hardly
any
one
got
the
facts
quite
right
workmen
quite
generally
believed
that
they
were
going
to
get
five
dollars
a
day
regardless
of
what
work
they
did
the
facts
were
somewhat
different
from
the
general
impression
the
plan
was
to
distribute
profits
but
instead
of
waiting
until
the
profits
had
been
earned
to
approximate
them
in
advance
and
to
add
them
under
certain
conditions
to
the
wages
of
those
persons
who
had
been
in
the
employ
of
the
company
for
six
months
or
more
it
was
classified
participation
among
three
classes
of
employees
married
men
living
with
and
taking
good
care
of
their
families
single
men
over
years
of
age
who
are
of
proved
thrifty
habits
young
men
under
years
of
age
and
women
who
are
the
sole
support
of
some
next
of
kin
a
man
was
first
to
be
paid
his
just
wages
which
were
then
on
an
average
of
about
fifteen
per
cent
above
the
usual
market
wage
he
was
then
eligible
to
a
certain
profit
his
wages
plus
his
profit
were
calculated
to
give
a
minimum
daily
income
of
five
dollars
the
profit
sharing
rate
was
divided
on
an
hour
basis
and
was
credited
to
the
hourly
wage
rate
so
as
to
give
those
receiving
the
lowest
hourly
rate
the
largest
proportion
of
profits
it
was
paid
every
two
weeks
with
the
wages
for
example
a
man
who
received
cents
an
hour
had
a
profit
rate
of
and
one
half
cents
an
hour
which
would
give
him
a
daily
income
of
five
dollars
a
man
receiving
cents
an
hour
would
have
a
profit
rate
of
cents
an
hour
which
would
give
him
a
daily
income
of
six
dollars
it
was
a
sort
of
plan
but
on
conditions
the
man
and
his
home
had
to
come
up
to
certain
standards
of
cleanliness
and
citizenship
nothing
paternal
was
intended
a
certain
amount
of
paternalism
did
develop
and
that
is
one
reason
why
the
whole
plan
and
the
social
welfare
department
were
readjusted
but
in
the
beginning
the
idea
was
that
there
should
be
a
very
definite
incentive
to
better
living
and
that
the
very
best
incentive
was
a
money
premium
on
proper
living
a
man
who
is
living
aright
will
do
his
work
aright
and
then
too
we
wanted
to
avoid
the
possibility
of
lowering
the
standard
of
work
through
an
increased
wage
it
was
demonstrated
in
war
time
that
too
quickly
increasing
a
man
pay
sometimes
increases
only
his
cupidity
and
therefore
decreases
his
earning
power
if
in
the
beginning
we
had
simply
put
the
increase
in
the
pay
envelopes
then
very
likely
the
work
standards
would
have
broken
down
the
pay
of
about
half
the
men
was
doubled
in
the
new
plan
it
might
have
been
taken
as
easy
money
the
thought
of
easy
money
breaks
down
work
there
is
a
danger
in
too
rapidly
raising
the
pay
of
any
man
whether
he
previously
received
one
dollar
or
one
hundred
dollars
a
day
in
fact
if
the
salary
of
a
man
were
increased
overnight
to
three
hundred
dollars
a
day
he
would
probably
make
a
bigger
fool
of
himself
than
the
working
man
whose
pay
is
increased
from
one
dollar
to
three
dollars
an
hour
the
man
with
the
larger
amount
of
money
has
larger
opportunity
to
make
a
fool
of
himself
in
this
first
plan
the
standards
insisted
upon
were
not
petty
although
sometimes
they
may
have
been
administered
in
a
petty
fashion
we
had
about
fifty
investigators
in
the
social
department
the
standard
of
common
sense
among
them
was
very
high
indeed
but
it
is
impossible
to
assemble
fifty
men
equally
endowed
with
common
sense
they
erred
at
times
one
always
hears
about
the
errors
it
was
expected
that
in
order
to
receive
the
bonus
married
men
should
live
with
and
take
proper
care
of
their
families
we
had
to
break
up
the
evil
custom
among
many
of
the
foreign
workers
of
taking
in
boarders
of
regarding
their
homes
as
something
to
make
money
out
of
rather
than
as
a
place
to
live
in
boys
under
eighteen
received
a
bonus
if
they
supported
the
next
of
kin
single
men
who
lived
wholesomely
shared
the
best
evidence
that
the
plan
was
essentially
beneficial
is
the
record
when
the
plan
went
into
effect
per
cent
of
the
workers
immediately
qualified
to
share
at
the
end
of
six
months
per
cent
were
sharing
and
at
the
end
of
one
year
per
cent
within
a
year
and
one
half
only
a
fraction
of
one
per
cent
failed
to
share
the
large
wage
had
other
results
in
when
the
first
plan
went
into
effect
we
had
employees
and
it
had
been
necessary
to
hire
at
the
rate
of
about
a
year
in
order
to
keep
a
constant
force
of
in
we
had
to
hire
only
men
and
the
majority
of
these
new
men
were
taken
on
because
of
the
growth
of
the
business
with
the
old
turnover
of
labour
and
our
present
force
we
should
have
to
hire
at
the
rate
of
nearly
men
a
year
which
would
be
pretty
nearly
an
impossible
proposition
even
with
the
minimum
of
instruction
that
is
required
to
master
almost
any
job
in
our
place
we
can
not
take
on
a
new
staff
each
morning
or
each
week
or
each
month
for
although
a
man
may
qualify
for
acceptable
work
at
an
acceptable
rate
of
speed
within
two
or
three
days
he
will
be
able
to
do
more
after
a
year
experience
than
he
did
at
the
beginning
the
matter
of
labour
turnover
has
not
since
bothered
us
it
is
rather
hard
to
give
exact
figures
because
when
we
are
not
running
to
capacity
we
rotate
some
of
the
men
in
order
to
distribute
the
work
among
greatest
number
this
makes
it
hard
to
distinguish
between
the
voluntary
and
involuntary
exits
we
keep
no
figures
we
now
think
so
little
of
our
turnover
that
we
do
not
bother
to
keep
records
as
far
as
we
know
the
turnover
is
somewhere
between
per
cent
and
per
cent
a
month
we
have
made
changes
in
the
system
but
we
have
not
deviated
from
this
principle
if
you
expect
a
man
to
give
his
time
and
energy
fix
his
wages
so
that
he
will
have
no
financial
worries
it
pays
our
profits
after
paying
good
wages
and
a
bonus
which
bonus
used
to
run
around
ten
millions
a
year
before
we
changed
the
system
show
that
paying
good
wages
is
the
most
profitable
way
of
doing
business
there
were
objections
to
the
method
of
paying
wages
it
tended
toward
paternalism
paternalism
has
no
place
in
industry
welfare
work
that
consists
in
prying
into
employees
private
concerns
is
out
of
date
men
need
counsel
and
men
need
help
oftentimes
special
help
and
all
this
ought
to
be
rendered
for
decency
sake
but
the
broad
workable
plan
of
investment
and
participation
will
do
more
to
solidify
industry
and
strengthen
organization
than
will
any
social
work
on
the
outside
without
changing
the
principle
we
have
changed
the
method
of
payment
chapter

why
not
always
have
good
business
the
employer
has
to
live
by
the
year
the
workman
has
to
live
by
the
year
but
both
of
them
as
a
rule
work
by
the
week
they
get
an
order
or
a
job
when
they
can
and
at
the
price
they
can
during
what
is
called
a
prosperous
time
orders
and
jobs
are
plentiful
during
a
dull
season
they
are
scarce
business
is
always
either
feasting
or
fasting
and
is
always
either
good
or
bad
although
there
is
never
a
time
when
everyone
has
too
much
of
this
world
goods
when
everyone
is
too
comfortable
or
too
happy
there
come
periods
when
we
have
the
astounding
spectacle
of
a
world
hungry
for
goods
and
an
industrial
machine
hungry
for
work
and
the
two
the
demand
and
the
means
of
satisfying
it
held
apart
by
a
money
barrier
both
manufacturing
and
employment
are
affairs
instead
of
a
steady
progression
we
go
ahead
by
fits
and
starts
now
going
too
fast
now
stopping
altogether
when
a
great
many
people
want
to
buy
there
is
said
to
be
a
shortage
of
goods
when
nobody
wants
to
buy
there
is
said
to
be
an
overproduction
of
goods
i
know
that
we
have
always
had
a
shortage
of
goods
but
i
do
not
believe
we
have
ever
had
an
overproduction
we
may
have
at
a
particular
time
too
much
of
the
wrong
kind
of
goods
that
is
not
overproduction
that
is
merely
headless
production
we
may
also
have
great
stocks
of
goods
at
too
high
prices
that
is
not
overproduction
it
is
either
bad
manufacturing
or
bad
financing
is
business
good
or
bad
according
to
the
dictates
of
fate
must
we
accept
the
conditions
as
inevitable
business
is
good
or
bad
as
we
make
it
so
the
only
reason
for
growing
crops
for
mining
or
for
manufacturing
is
that
people
may
eat
keep
warm
have
clothing
to
wear
and
articles
to
use
there
is
no
other
possible
reason
yet
that
reason
is
forced
into
the
background
and
instead
we
have
operations
carried
on
not
to
the
end
of
service
but
to
the
end
of
making
money
and
this
because
we
have
evolved
a
system
of
money
that
instead
of
being
a
convenient
medium
of
exchange
is
at
times
a
barrier
to
exchange
of
this
more
later
we
suffer
frequent
periods
of
bad
luck
only
because
we
manage
so
badly
if
we
had
a
vast
crop
failure
i
can
imagine
the
country
going
hungry
but
i
can
not
conceive
how
it
is
that
we
tolerate
hunger
and
poverty
when
they
grow
solely
out
of
bad
management
and
especially
out
of
the
bad
management
that
is
implicit
in
an
unreasoned
financial
structure
of
course
the
war
upset
affairs
in
this
country
it
upset
the
whole
world
there
would
have
been
no
war
had
management
been
better
but
the
war
alone
is
not
to
blame
the
war
showed
up
a
great
number
of
the
defects
of
the
financial
system
but
more
than
anything
else
it
showed
how
insecure
is
business
supported
only
by
a
money
foundation
i
do
not
know
whether
bad
business
is
the
result
of
bad
financial
methods
or
whether
the
wrong
motive
in
business
created
bad
financial
methods
but
i
do
know
that
while
it
would
be
wholly
undesirable
to
try
to
overturn
the
present
financial
system
it
is
wholly
desirable
to
reshape
business
on
the
basis
of
service
then
a
better
financial
system
will
have
to
come
the
present
system
will
drop
out
because
it
will
have
no
reason
for
being
the
process
will
have
to
be
a
gradual
one
the
start
toward
the
stabilization
of
his
own
affairs
may
be
made
by
any
one
one
can
not
achieve
perfect
results
acting
alone
but
as
the
example
begins
to
sink
in
there
will
be
followers
and
thus
in
the
course
of
time
we
can
hope
to
put
inflated
business
and
its
fellow
depressed
business
into
a
class
with
that
is
into
the
class
of
preventable
diseases
it
is
perfectly
possible
with
the
reorganization
of
business
and
finance
that
is
bound
to
come
about
to
take
the
ill
effect
of
seasons
if
not
the
seasons
out
of
industry
and
also
the
periodic
depressions
farming
is
already
in
process
of
reorganization
when
industry
and
farming
are
fully
reorganized
they
will
be
complementary
they
belong
together
not
apart
as
an
indication
take
our
valve
plant
we
established
it
eighteen
miles
out
in
the
country
so
that
the
workers
could
also
be
farmers
by
the
use
of
machinery
farming
need
not
consume
more
than
a
fraction
of
the
time
it
now
consumes
the
time
nature
requires
to
produce
is
much
larger
than
that
required
for
the
human
contribution
of
seeding
cultivating
and
harvesting
in
many
industries
where
the
parts
are
not
bulky
it
does
not
make
much
difference
where
they
are
made
by
the
aid
of
water
power
they
can
well
be
made
out
in
farming
country
thus
we
can
to
a
much
larger
degree
than
is
commonly
known
have
who
both
farm
and
work
under
the
most
scientific
and
healthful
conditions
that
arrangement
will
care
for
some
seasonal
industries
others
can
arrange
a
succession
of
products
according
to
the
seasons
and
the
equipment
and
still
others
can
with
more
careful
management
iron
out
their
seasons
a
complete
study
of
any
specific
problem
will
show
the
way
the
periodic
depressions
are
more
serious
because
they
seem
so
vast
as
to
be
uncontrollable
until
the
whole
reorganization
is
brought
about
they
can
not
be
wholly
controlled
but
each
man
in
business
can
easily
do
something
for
himself
and
while
benefiting
his
own
organization
in
a
very
material
way
also
help
others
the
ford
production
has
not
reflected
good
times
or
bad
times
it
has
kept
right
on
regardless
of
conditions
excepting
from
to
when
the
factory
was
turned
over
to
war
work
the
year
was
supposed
to
be
a
dull
one
although
now
some
call
it
normal
we
all
but
doubled
our
sales
was
dull
we
increased
our
sales
by
more
than
a
third
the
year
is
supposed
to
have
been
one
of
the
most
depressed
in
history
we
sold
a
million
and
a
quarter
cars
or
about
five
times
as
many
as
in
the
normal
year
there
is
no
particular
secret
in
it
it
is
as
is
everything
else
in
our
business
the
inevitable
result
of
the
application
of
a
principle
which
can
be
applied
to
any
business
we
now
have
a
minimum
wage
of
six
dollars
a
day
paid
without
reservation
the
people
are
sufficiently
used
to
high
wages
to
make
supervision
unnecessary
the
minimum
wage
is
paid
just
as
soon
as
a
worker
has
qualified
in
his
production
which
is
a
matter
that
depends
upon
his
own
desire
to
work
we
have
put
our
estimate
of
profits
into
the
wage
and
are
now
paying
higher
wages
than
during
the
boom
times
after
the
war
but
we
are
as
always
paying
them
on
the
basis
of
work
and
that
the
men
do
work
is
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
although
six
dollars
a
day
is
the
minimum
wage
about
per
cent
of
the
workers
receive
above
the
minimum
the
six
dollars
is
not
a
flat
but
a
minimum
wage
consider
first
the
fundamentals
of
prosperity
progress
is
not
made
by
pulling
off
a
series
of
stunts
each
step
has
to
be
regulated
a
man
can
not
expect
to
progress
without
thinking
take
prosperity
a
truly
prosperous
time
is
when
the
largest
number
of
people
are
getting
all
they
can
legitimately
eat
and
wear
and
are
in
every
sense
of
the
word
comfortable
it
is
the
degree
of
the
comfort
of
the
people
at
large
not
the
size
of
the
manufacturer
bank
balance
that
evidences
prosperity
the
function
of
the
manufacturer
is
to
contribute
to
this
comfort
he
is
an
instrument
of
society
and
he
can
serve
society
only
as
he
manages
his
enterprises
so
as
to
turn
over
to
the
public
an
increasingly
better
product
at
an
price
and
at
the
same
time
to
pay
to
all
those
who
have
a
hand
in
his
business
an
wage
based
upon
the
work
they
do
in
this
way
and
in
this
way
alone
can
a
manufacturer
or
any
one
in
business
justify
his
existence
we
are
not
much
concerned
with
the
statistics
and
the
theories
of
the
economists
on
the
recurring
cycles
of
prosperity
and
depression
they
call
the
periods
when
prices
are
high
prosperous
a
really
prosperous
period
is
not
to
be
judged
on
the
prices
that
manufacturers
are
quoting
for
articles
we
are
not
concerned
with
combinations
of
words
if
the
prices
of
goods
are
above
the
incomes
of
the
people
then
get
the
prices
down
to
the
incomes
ordinarily
business
is
conceived
as
starting
with
a
manufacturing
process
and
ending
with
a
consumer
if
that
consumer
does
not
want
to
buy
what
the
manufacturer
has
to
sell
him
and
has
not
the
money
to
buy
it
then
the
manufacturer
blames
the
consumer
and
says
that
business
is
bad
and
thus
hitching
the
cart
before
the
horse
he
goes
on
his
way
lamenting
is
that
nonsense
does
the
manufacturer
exist
for
the
consumer
or
does
the
consumer
exist
for
the
manufacturer
if
the
consumer
will
not
says
he
can
not
buy
what
the
manufacturer
has
to
offer
is
that
the
fault
of
the
manufacturer
or
the
consumer
or
is
nobody
at
fault
if
nobody
is
at
fault
then
the
manufacturer
must
go
out
of
business
but
what
business
ever
started
with
the
manufacturer
and
ended
with
the
consumer
where
does
the
money
to
make
the
wheels
go
round
come
from
from
the
consumer
of
course
and
success
in
manufacture
is
based
solely
upon
an
ability
to
serve
that
consumer
to
his
liking
he
may
be
served
by
quality
or
he
may
be
served
by
price
he
is
best
served
by
the
highest
quality
at
the
lowest
price
and
any
man
who
can
give
to
the
consumer
the
highest
quality
at
the
lowest
price
is
bound
to
be
a
leader
in
business
whatever
the
kind
of
an
article
he
makes
there
is
no
getting
away
from
this
then
why
flounder
around
waiting
for
good
business
get
the
costs
down
by
better
management
get
the
prices
down
to
the
buying
power
cutting
wages
is
the
easiest
and
most
slovenly
way
to
handle
the
situation
not
to
speak
of
its
being
an
inhuman
way
it
is
in
effect
throwing
upon
labour
the
incompetency
of
the
managers
of
the
business
if
we
only
knew
it
every
depression
is
a
challenge
to
every
manufacturer
to
put
more
brains
into
his
business
to
overcome
by
management
what
other
people
try
to
overcome
by
wage
reduction
to
tamper
with
wages
before
all
else
is
changed
is
to
evade
the
real
issue
and
if
the
real
issue
is
tackled
first
no
reduction
of
wages
may
be
necessary
that
has
been
my
experience
the
immediate
practical
point
is
that
in
the
process
of
adjustment
someone
will
have
to
take
a
loss
and
who
can
take
a
loss
except
those
who
have
something
which
they
can
afford
to
lose
but
the
expression
take
a
loss
is
rather
misleading
really
no
loss
is
taken
at
all
it
is
only
a
giving
up
of
a
certain
part
of
the
past
profits
in
order
to
gain
more
in
the
future
i
was
talking
not
long
since
with
a
hardware
merchant
in
a
small
town
he
said
i
expect
to
take
a
loss
of
on
my
stock
but
of
course
you
know
it
is
really
like
losing
that
much
we
hardware
men
have
had
pretty
good
times
most
of
my
stock
was
bought
at
high
prices
but
i
have
already
sold
several
stocks
and
had
the
benefit
of
them
besides
the
ten
thousand
dollars
which
i
say
i
will
lose
are
not
the
same
kind
of
dollars
that
i
used
to
have
they
are
in
a
way
speculative
dollars
they
are
not
the
good
dollars
that
bought
cents
worth
so
though
my
loss
may
sound
big
it
is
not
big
and
at
the
same
time
i
am
making
it
possible
for
the
people
in
my
town
to
go
on
building
their
houses
without
being
discouraged
by
the
size
of
the
hardware
item
he
is
a
wise
merchant
he
would
rather
take
less
profit
and
keep
business
moving
than
keep
his
stock
at
high
prices
and
bar
the
progress
of
his
community
a
man
like
that
is
an
asset
to
a
town
he
has
a
clear
head
he
is
better
able
to
swing
the
adjustment
through
his
inventory
than
through
cutting
down
the
wages
of
his
delivery
men
through
cutting
down
their
ability
to
buy
he
did
not
sit
around
holding
on
to
his
prices
and
waiting
for
something
to
turn
up
he
realized
what
seems
to
have
been
quite
generally
forgotten
that
it
is
part
of
proprietorship
every
now
and
again
to
lose
money
we
had
to
take
our
loss
our
sales
eventually
fell
off
as
all
other
sales
fell
off
we
had
a
large
inventory
and
taking
the
materials
and
parts
in
that
inventory
at
their
cost
price
we
could
not
turn
out
a
car
at
a
price
lower
than
we
were
asking
but
that
was
a
price
which
on
the
turn
of
business
was
higher
than
people
could
or
wanted
to
pay
we
closed
down
to
get
our
bearings
we
were
faced
with
making
a
cut
of
in
the
inventory
or
taking
a
much
larger
loss
than
that
by
not
doing
business
so
there
was
no
choice
at
all
that
is
always
the
choice
that
a
man
in
business
has
he
can
take
the
direct
loss
on
his
books
and
go
ahead
and
do
business
or
he
can
stop
doing
business
and
take
the
loss
of
idleness
the
loss
of
not
doing
business
is
commonly
a
loss
greater
than
the
actual
money
involved
for
during
the
period
of
idleness
fear
will
consume
initiative
and
if
the
shutdown
is
long
enough
there
will
be
no
energy
left
over
to
start
up
with
again
there
is
no
use
waiting
around
for
business
to
improve
if
a
manufacturer
wants
to
perform
his
function
he
must
get
his
price
down
to
what
people
will
pay
there
is
always
no
matter
what
the
condition
a
price
that
people
can
and
will
pay
for
a
necessity
and
always
if
the
will
is
there
that
price
can
be
met
it
can
not
be
met
by
lowering
quality
or
by
shortsighted
economy
which
results
only
in
a
dissatisfied
working
force
it
can
not
be
met
by
fussing
or
buzzing
around
it
can
be
met
only
by
increasing
the
efficiency
of
production
and
viewed
in
this
fashion
each
business
depression
ought
to
be
regarded
as
a
challenge
to
the
brains
of
the
business
community
concentrating
on
prices
instead
of
on
service
is
a
sure
indication
of
the
kind
of
business
man
who
can
give
no
justification
for
his
existence
as
a
proprietor
this
is
only
another
way
of
saying
that
sales
should
be
made
on
the
natural
basis
of
real
value
which
is
the
cost
of
transmuting
human
energy
into
articles
of
trade
and
commerce
but
that
simple
formula
is
not
considered
it
is
not
complex
enough
we
have
business
which
takes
the
most
honest
of
all
human
activities
and
makes
them
subject
to
the
speculative
shrewdness
of
men
who
can
produce
false
shortages
of
food
and
other
commodities
and
thus
excite
in
society
anxiety
of
demand
we
have
false
stimulation
and
then
false
numbness
economic
justice
is
being
constantly
and
quite
often
innocently
violated
you
may
say
that
it
is
the
economic
condition
which
makes
mankind
what
it
is
or
you
may
say
that
it
is
mankind
that
makes
the
economic
condition
what
it
is
you
will
find
many
claiming
that
it
is
the
economic
system
which
makes
men
what
they
are
they
blame
our
industrial
system
for
all
the
faults
which
we
behold
in
mankind
generally
and
you
will
find
other
men
who
say
that
man
creates
his
own
conditions
that
if
the
economic
industrial
or
social
system
is
bad
it
is
but
a
reflection
of
what
man
himself
is
what
is
wrong
in
our
industrial
system
is
a
reflection
of
what
is
wrong
in
man
himself
manufacturers
hesitate
to
admit
that
the
mistakes
of
the
present
industrial
methods
are
in
part
at
least
their
own
mistakes
systematized
and
extended
but
take
the
question
outside
of
a
immediate
concerns
and
he
sees
the
point
readily
enough
no
doubt
with
a
less
faulty
human
nature
a
less
faulty
social
system
would
have
grown
up
or
if
human
nature
were
worse
than
it
is
a
worse
system
would
have
grown
up
though
probably
a
worse
system
would
not
have
lasted
as
long
as
the
present
one
has
but
few
will
claim
that
mankind
deliberately
set
out
to
create
a
faulty
social
system
granting
without
reserve
that
all
faults
of
the
social
system
are
in
man
himself
it
does
not
follow
that
he
deliberately
organized
his
imperfections
and
established
them
we
shall
have
to
charge
a
great
deal
up
to
ignorance
we
shall
have
to
charge
a
great
deal
up
to
innocence
take
the
beginnings
of
our
present
industrial
system
there
was
no
indication
of
how
it
would
grow
every
new
advance
was
hailed
with
joy
no
one
ever
thought
of
capital
and
labour
as
hostile
interests
no
one
ever
dreamed
that
the
very
fact
of
success
would
bring
insidious
dangers
with
it
and
yet
with
growth
every
imperfection
latent
in
the
system
came
out
a
man
business
grew
to
such
proportions
that
he
had
to
have
more
helpers
than
he
knew
by
their
first
names
but
that
fact
was
not
regretted
it
was
rather
hailed
with
joy
and
yet
it
has
since
led
to
an
impersonal
system
wherein
the
workman
has
become
something
less
than
a
person
a
mere
part
of
the
system
no
one
believes
of
course
that
this
dehumanizing
process
was
deliberately
invented
it
just
grew
it
was
latent
in
the
whole
early
system
but
no
one
saw
it
and
no
one
could
foresee
it
only
prodigious
and
development
could
bring
it
to
light
take
the
industrial
idea
what
is
it
the
true
industrial
idea
is
not
to
make
money
the
industrial
idea
is
to
express
a
serviceable
idea
to
duplicate
a
useful
idea
by
as
many
thousands
as
there
are
people
who
need
it
to
produce
produce
to
get
a
system
that
will
reduce
production
to
a
fine
art
to
put
production
on
such
a
basis
as
will
provide
means
for
expansion
and
the
building
of
still
more
shops
the
production
of
still
more
thousands
of
useful
things
that
is
the
real
industrial
idea
the
negation
of
the
industrial
idea
is
the
effort
to
make
a
profit
out
of
speculation
instead
of
out
of
work
there
are
men
who
can
not
see
that
business
is
bigger
than
any
one
man
interests
business
is
a
process
of
give
and
take
live
and
let
live
it
is
cooperation
among
many
forces
and
interests
whenever
you
find
a
man
who
believes
that
business
is
a
river
whose
beneficial
flow
ought
to
stop
as
soon
as
it
reaches
him
you
find
a
man
who
thinks
he
can
keep
business
alive
by
stopping
its
circulation
he
would
produce
wealth
by
this
stopping
of
the
production
of
wealth
the
principles
of

chapter
x
how
cheaply
can
things
be
made
no
one
will
deny
that
if
prices
are
sufficiently
low
buyers
will
always
be
found
no
matter
what
are
supposed
to
be
the
business
conditions
that
is
one
of
the
elemental
facts
of
business
sometimes
raw
materials
will
not
move
no
matter
how
low
the
price
we
have
seen
something
of
that
during
the
last
year
but
that
is
because
the
manufacturers
and
the
distributors
were
trying
to
dispose
of
stocks
before
making
new
engagements
the
markets
were
stagnant
but
not
saturated
with
goods
what
is
called
a
saturated
market
is
only
one
in
which
the
prices
are
above
the
purchasing
power
unduly
high
prices
are
always
a
sign
of
unsound
business
because
they
are
always
due
to
some
abnormal
condition
a
healthy
patient
has
a
normal
temperature
a
healthy
market
has
normal
prices
high
prices
come
about
commonly
by
reason
of
speculation
following
the
report
of
a
shortage
although
there
is
never
a
shortage
in
everything
a
shortage
in
just
a
few
important
commodities
or
even
in
one
serves
to
start
speculation
or
again
goods
may
not
be
short
at
all
an
inflation
of
currency
or
credit
will
cause
a
quick
bulge
in
apparent
buying
power
and
the
consequent
opportunity
to
speculate
there
may
be
a
combination
of
actual
shortages
and
a
currency
inflation
as
frequently
happens
during
war
but
in
any
condition
of
unduly
high
prices
no
matter
what
the
real
cause
the
people
pay
the
high
prices
because
they
think
there
is
going
to
be
a
shortage
they
may
buy
bread
ahead
of
their
own
needs
so
as
not
to
be
left
later
in
the
lurch
or
they
may
buy
in
the
hope
of
reselling
at
a
profit
when
there
was
talk
of
a
sugar
shortage
housewives
who
had
never
in
their
lives
bought
more
than
ten
pounds
of
sugar
at
once
tried
to
get
stocks
of
one
hundred
or
two
hundred
pounds
and
while
they
were
doing
this
speculators
were
buying
sugar
to
store
in
warehouses
nearly
all
our
war
shortages
were
caused
by
speculation
or
buying
ahead
of
need
no
matter
how
short
the
supply
of
an
article
is
supposed
to
be
no
matter
if
the
government
takes
control
and
seizes
every
ounce
of
that
article
a
man
who
is
willing
to
pay
the
money
can
always
get
whatever
supply
he
is
willing
to
pay
for
no
one
ever
knows
actually
how
great
or
how
small
is
the
national
stock
of
any
commodity
the
very
best
figures
are
not
more
than
guesses
estimates
of
the
world
stock
of
a
commodity
are
still
wilder
we
may
think
we
know
how
much
of
a
commodity
is
produced
on
a
certain
day
or
in
a
certain
month
but
that
does
not
tell
us
how
much
will
be
produced
the
next
day
or
the
next
month
likewise
we
do
not
know
how
much
is
consumed
by
spending
a
great
deal
of
money
we
might
in
the
course
of
time
get
at
fairly
accurate
figures
on
how
much
of
a
particular
commodity
was
consumed
over
a
period
but
by
the
time
those
figures
were
compiled
they
would
be
utterly
useless
except
for
historical
purposes
because
in
the
next
period
the
consumption
might
be
double
or
half
as
much
people
do
not
stay
put
that
is
the
trouble
with
all
the
framers
of
socialistic
and
communistic
and
of
all
other
plans
for
the
ideal
regulation
of
society
they
all
presume
that
people
will
stay
put
the
reactionary
has
the
same
idea
he
insists
that
everyone
ought
to
stay
put
nobody
does
and
for
that
i
am
thankful
consumption
varies
according
to
the
price
and
the
quality
and
nobody
knows
or
can
figure
out
what
future
consumption
will
amount
to
because
every
time
a
price
is
lowered
a
new
stratum
of
buying
power
is
reached
everyone
knows
that
but
many
refuse
to
recognize
it
by
their
acts
when
a
storekeeper
buys
goods
at
a
wrong
price
and
finds
they
will
not
move
he
reduces
the
price
by
degrees
until
they
do
move
if
he
is
wise
instead
of
nibbling
at
the
price
and
encouraging
in
his
customers
the
hope
of
even
lower
prices
he
takes
a
great
big
bite
out
of
the
price
and
gets
the
stuff
out
of
his
place
everyone
takes
a
loss
on
some
proposition
of
sales
the
common
hope
is
that
after
the
loss
there
may
be
a
big
profit
to
make
up
for
the
loss
that
is
usually
a
delusion
the
profit
out
of
which
the
loss
has
to
be
taken
must
be
found
in
the
business
preceding
the
cut
any
one
who
was
foolish
enough
to
regard
the
high
profits
of
the
boom
period
as
permanent
profits
got
into
financial
trouble
when
the
drop
came
however
there
is
a
belief
and
a
very
strong
one
that
business
consists
of
a
series
of
profits
and
losses
and
good
business
is
one
in
which
the
profits
exceed
the
losses
therefore
some
men
reason
that
the
best
price
to
sell
at
is
the
highest
price
which
may
be
had
that
is
supposed
to
be
good
business
practice
is
it
we
have
not
found
it
so
we
have
found
in
buying
materials
that
it
is
not
worth
while
to
buy
for
other
than
immediate
needs
we
buy
only
enough
to
fit
into
the
plan
of
production
taking
into
consideration
the
state
of
transportation
at
the
time
if
transportation
were
perfect
and
an
even
flow
of
materials
could
be
assured
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
carry
any
stock
whatsoever
the
carloads
of
raw
materials
would
arrive
on
schedule
and
in
the
planned
order
and
amounts
and
go
from
the
railway
cars
into
production
that
would
save
a
great
deal
of
money
for
it
would
give
a
very
rapid
turnover
and
thus
decrease
the
amount
of
money
tied
up
in
materials
with
bad
transportation
one
has
to
carry
larger
stocks
at
the
time
of
revaluing
the
inventory
in
the
stock
was
unduly
high
because
transportation
had
been
so
bad
but
we
learned
long
ago
never
to
buy
ahead
for
speculative
purposes
when
prices
are
going
up
it
is
considered
good
business
to
buy
far
ahead
and
when
prices
are
up
to
buy
as
little
as
possible
it
needs
no
argument
to
demonstrate
that
if
you
buy
materials
at
ten
cents
a
pound
and
the
material
goes
later
to
twenty
cents
a
pound
you
will
have
a
distinct
advantage
over
the
man
who
is
compelled
to
buy
at
twenty
cents
but
we
have
found
that
thus
buying
ahead
does
not
pay
it
is
entering
into
a
guessing
contest
it
is
not
business
if
a
man
buys
a
large
stock
at
ten
cents
he
is
in
a
fine
position
as
long
as
the
other
man
is
paying
twenty
cents
then
he
later
gets
a
chance
to
buy
more
of
the
material
at
twenty
cents
and
it
seems
to
be
a
good
buy
because
everything
points
to
the
price
going
to
thirty
cents
having
great
satisfaction
in
his
previous
judgment
on
which
he
made
money
he
of
course
makes
the
new
purchase
then
the
price
drops
and
he
is
just
where
he
started
we
have
carefully
figured
over
the
years
that
buying
ahead
of
requirements
does
not
pay
that
the
gains
on
one
purchase
will
be
offset
by
the
losses
on
another
and
in
the
end
we
have
gone
to
a
great
deal
of
trouble
without
any
corresponding
benefit
therefore
in
our
buying
we
simply
get
the
best
price
we
can
for
the
quantity
that
we
require
we
do
not
buy
less
if
the
price
be
high
and
we
do
not
buy
more
if
the
price
be
low
we
carefully
avoid
bargain
lots
in
excess
of
requirements
it
was
not
easy
to
reach
that
decision
but
in
the
end
speculation
will
kill
any
manufacturer
give
him
a
couple
of
good
purchases
on
which
he
makes
money
and
before
long
he
will
be
thinking
more
about
making
money
out
of
buying
and
selling
than
out
of
his
legitimate
business
and
he
will
smash
the
only
way
to
keep
out
of
trouble
is
to
buy
what
one
needs
no
more
and
no
less
that
course
removes
one
hazard
from
business
this
buying
experience
is
given
at
length
because
it
explains
our
selling
policy
instead
of
giving
attention
to
competitors
or
to
demand
our
prices
are
based
on
an
estimate
of
what
the
largest
possible
number
of
people
will
want
to
pay
or
can
pay
for
what
we
have
to
sell
and
what
has
resulted
from
that
policy
is
best
evidenced
by
comparing
the
price
of
the
touring
car
and
the
production
year
price
production
cars
the
above
two
years
were
war
years
and
the
factory
was
in
war
work
to
to
the
high
prices
of
were
considering
the
financial
inflation
not
really
high
at
the
time
of
writing
the
price
is
these
prices
are
actually
lower
than
they
appear
to
be
because
improvements
in
quality
are
being
steadily
made
we
study
every
car
in
order
to
discover
if
it
has
features
that
might
be
developed
and
adapted
if
any
one
has
anything
better
than
we
have
we
want
to
know
it
and
for
that
reason
we
buy
one
of
every
new
car
that
comes
out
usually
the
car
is
used
for
a
while
put
through
a
road
test
taken
apart
and
studied
as
to
how
and
of
what
everything
is
made
scattered
about
dearborn
there
is
probably
one
of
nearly
every
make
of
car
on
earth
every
little
while
when
we
buy
a
new
car
it
gets
into
the
newspapers
and
somebody
remarks
that
ford
does
use
the
ford
last
year
we
ordered
a
big
lanchester
which
is
supposed
to
be
the
best
car
in
england
it
lay
in
our
long
island
factory
for
several
months
and
then
i
decided
to
drive
it
to
detroit
there
were
several
of
us
and
we
had
a
little
caravan
the
lanchester
a
packard
and
a
ford
or
two
i
happened
to
be
riding
in
the
lanchester
passing
through
a
new
york
town
and
when
the
reporters
came
up
they
wanted
to
know
right
away
why
i
was
not
riding
in
a
ford
well
you
see
it
is
this
way
i
answered
i
am
on
a
vacation
now
i
am
in
no
hurry
we
do
not
care
much
when
we
get
home
that
is
the
reason
i
am
not
in
the
ford
you
know
we
also
have
a
line
of
ford
stories
our
policy
is
to
reduce
the
price
extend
the
operations
and
improve
the
article
you
will
notice
that
the
reduction
of
price
comes
first
we
have
never
considered
any
costs
as
fixed
therefore
we
first
reduce
the
price
to
a
point
where
we
believe
more
sales
will
result
then
we
go
ahead
and
try
to
make
the
price
we
do
not
bother
about
the
costs
the
new
price
forces
the
costs
down
the
more
usual
way
is
to
take
the
costs
and
then
determine
the
price
and
although
that
method
may
be
scientific
in
the
narrow
sense
it
is
not
scientific
in
the
broad
sense
because
what
earthly
use
is
it
to
know
the
cost
if
it
tells
you
you
can
not
manufacture
at
a
price
at
which
the
article
can
be
sold
but
more
to
the
point
is
the
fact
that
although
one
may
calculate
what
a
cost
is
and
of
course
all
of
our
costs
are
carefully
calculated
no
one
knows
what
a
cost
ought
to
be
one
of
the
ways
of
discovering
what
a
cost
ought
to
be
is
to
name
a
price
so
low
as
to
force
everybody
in
the
place
to
the
highest
point
of
efficiency
the
low
price
makes
everybody
dig
for
profits
we
make
more
discoveries
concerning
manufacturing
and
selling
under
this
forced
method
than
by
any
method
of
leisurely
investigation
the
payment
of
high
wages
fortunately
contributes
to
the
low
costs
because
the
men
become
steadily
more
efficient
on
account
of
being
relieved
of
outside
worries
the
payment
of
five
dollars
a
day
for
an
day
was
one
of
the
finest
moves
we
ever
made
and
the
day
wage
is
cheaper
than
the
five
how
far
this
will
go
we
do
not
know
we
have
always
made
a
profit
at
the
prices
we
have
fixed
and
just
as
we
have
no
idea
how
high
wages
will
go
we
also
have
no
idea
how
low
prices
will
go
but
there
is
no
particular
use
in
bothering
on
that
point
the
tractor
for
instance
was
first
sold
for
then
at
then
at
and
the
other
day
we
cut
it
per
cent
to
the
tractor
is
not
made
in
connection
with
the
automobiles
no
plant
is
large
enough
to
make
two
articles
a
shop
has
to
be
devoted
to
exactly
one
product
in
order
to
get
the
real
economies
for
most
purposes
a
man
with
a
machine
is
better
than
a
man
without
a
machine
by
the
ordering
of
design
of
product
and
of
manufacturing
process
we
are
able
to
provide
that
kind
of
a
machine
which
most
multiplies
the
power
of
the
hand
and
therefore
we
give
to
that
man
a
larger
role
of
service
which
means
that
he
is
entitled
to
a
larger
share
of
comfort
keeping
that
principle
in
mind
we
can
attack
waste
with
a
definite
objective
we
will
not
put
into
our
establishment
anything
that
is
useless
we
will
not
put
up
elaborate
buildings
as
monuments
to
our
success
the
interest
on
the
investment
and
the
cost
of
their
upkeep
only
serve
to
add
uselessly
to
the
cost
of
what
is
produced
so
these
monuments
of
success
are
apt
to
end
as
tombs
a
great
administration
building
may
be
necessary
in
me
it
arouses
a
suspicion
that
perhaps
there
is
too
much
administration
we
have
never
found
a
need
for
elaborate
administration
and
would
prefer
to
be
advertised
by
our
product
than
by
where
we
make
our
product
the
standardization
that
effects
large
economies
for
the
consumer
results
in
profits
of
such
gross
magnitude
to
the
producer
that
he
can
scarcely
know
what
to
do
with
his
money
but
his
effort
must
be
sincere
painstaking
and
fearless
cutting
out
a
models
is
not
standardizing
it
may
be
and
usually
is
only
the
limiting
of
business
for
if
one
is
selling
on
the
ordinary
basis
of
profit
that
is
on
the
basis
of
taking
as
much
money
away
from
the
consumer
as
he
will
give
up
then
surely
the
consumer
ought
to
have
a
wide
range
of
choice
standardization
then
is
the
final
stage
of
the
process
we
start
with
consumer
work
back
through
the
design
and
finally
arrive
at
manufacturing
the
manufacturing
becomes
a
means
to
the
end
of
service
it
is
important
to
bear
this
order
in
mind
as
yet
the
order
is
not
thoroughly
understood
the
price
relation
is
not
understood
the
notion
persists
that
prices
ought
to
be
kept
up
on
the
contrary
good
business
large
consumption
depends
on
their
going
down
and
here
is
another
point
the
service
must
be
the
best
you
can
give
it
is
considered
good
manufacturing
practice
and
not
bad
ethics
occasionally
to
change
designs
so
that
old
models
will
become
obsolete
and
new
ones
will
have
to
be
bought
either
because
repair
parts
for
the
old
can
not
be
had
or
because
the
new
model
offers
a
new
sales
argument
which
can
be
used
to
persuade
a
consumer
to
scrap
what
he
has
and
buy
something
new
we
have
been
told
that
this
is
good
business
that
it
is
clever
business
that
the
object
of
business
ought
to
be
to
get
people
to
buy
frequently
and
that
it
is
bad
business
to
try
to
make
anything
that
will
last
forever
because
when
once
a
man
is
sold
he
will
not
buy
again
our
principle
of
business
is
precisely
to
the
contrary
we
can
not
conceive
how
to
serve
the
consumer
unless
we
make
for
him
something
that
as
far
as
we
can
provide
will
last
forever
we
want
to
construct
some
kind
of
a
machine
that
will
last
forever
it
does
not
please
us
to
have
a
buyer
car
wear
out
or
become
obsolete
we
want
the
man
who
buys
one
of
our
products
never
to
have
to
buy
another
we
never
make
an
improvement
that
renders
any
previous
model
obsolete
the
parts
of
a
specific
model
are
not
only
interchangeable
with
all
other
cars
of
that
model
but
they
are
interchangeable
with
similar
parts
on
all
the
cars
that
we
have
turned
out
you
can
take
a
car
of
ten
years
ago
and
buying
parts
make
it
with
very
little
expense
into
a
car
of
having
these
objectives
the
costs
always
come
down
under
pressure
and
since
we
have
the
firm
policy
of
steady
price
reduction
there
is
always
pressure
sometimes
it
is
just
harder
take
a
few
more
instances
of
saving
the
sweepings
net
six
hundred
thousand
dollars
a
year
experiments
are
constantly
going
on
in
the
utilization
of
scrap
in
one
of
the
stamping
operations
circles
of
sheet
metal
are
cut
out
these
formerly
went
into
scrap
the
waste
worried
the
men
they
worked
to
find
uses
for
the
discs
they
found
that
the
plates
were
just
the
right
size
and
shape
to
stamp
into
radiator
caps
but
the
metal
was
not
thick
enough
they
tried
a
double
thickness
of
plates
with
the
result
that
they
made
a
cap
which
tests
proved
to
be
stronger
than
one
made
out
of
a
single
sheet
of
metal
we
get
of
those
discs
a
day
we
have
now
found
a
use
for
about
a
day
and
expect
to
find
further
uses
for
the
remainder
we
saved
about
ten
dollars
each
by
making
transmissions
instead
of
buying
them
we
experimented
with
bolts
and
produced
a
special
bolt
made
on
what
is
called
an
upsetting
machine
with
a
rolled
thread
that
was
stronger
than
any
bolt
we
could
buy
although
in
its
making
was
used
only
about
one
third
of
the
material
that
the
outside
manufacturers
used
the
saving
on
one
style
of
bolt
alone
amounted
to
half
a
million
dollars
a
year
we
used
to
assemble
our
cars
at
detroit
and
although
by
special
packing
we
managed
to
get
five
or
six
into
a
freight
car
we
needed
many
hundreds
of
freight
cars
a
day
trains
were
moving
in
and
out
all
the
time
once
a
thousand
freight
cars
were
packed
in
a
single
day
a
certain
amount
of
congestion
was
inevitable
it
is
very
expensive
to
knock
down
machines
and
crate
them
so
that
they
can
not
be
injured
in
transit
to
say
nothing
of
the
transportation
charges
now
we
assemble
only
three
or
four
hundred
cars
a
day
at
detroit
just
enough
for
local
needs
we
now
ship
the
parts
to
our
assembling
stations
all
over
the
united
states
and
in
fact
pretty
much
all
over
the
world
and
the
machines
are
put
together
there
wherever
it
is
possible
for
a
branch
to
make
a
part
more
cheaply
than
we
can
make
it
in
detroit
and
ship
it
to
them
then
the
branch
makes
the
part
the
plant
at
manchester
england
is
making
nearly
an
entire
car
the
tractor
plant
at
cork
ireland
is
making
almost
a
complete
tractor
this
is
an
enormous
saving
of
expense
and
is
only
an
indication
of
what
may
be
done
throughout
industry
generally
when
each
part
of
a
composite
article
is
made
at
the
exact
point
where
it
may
be
made
most
economically
we
are
constantly
experimenting
with
every
material
that
enters
into
the
car
we
cut
most
of
our
own
lumber
from
our
own
forests
we
are
experimenting
in
the
manufacture
of
artificial
leather
because
we
use
about
forty
thousand
yards
of
artificial
leather
a
day
a
penny
here
and
a
penny
there
runs
into
large
amounts
in
the
course
of
a
year
the
greatest
development
of
all
however
is
the
river
rouge
plant
which
when
it
is
running
to
its
full
capacity
will
cut
deeply
and
in
many
directions
into
the
price
of
everything
we
make
the
whole
tractor
plant
is
now
there
this
plant
is
located
on
the
river
on
the
outskirts
of
detroit
and
the
property
covers
six
hundred
and
acres
enough
for
future
development
it
has
a
large
slip
and
a
turning
basin
capable
of
accommodating
any
lake
steamship
a
canal
and
some
dredging
will
give
a
direct
lake
connection
by
way
of
the
detroit
river
we
use
a
great
deal
of
coal
this
coal
comes
directly
from
our
mines
over
the
detroit
toledo
and
ironton
railway
which
we
control
to
the
highland
park
plant
and
the
river
rouge
plant
part
of
it
goes
for
steam
purposes
another
part
goes
to
the
coke
ovens
which
we
have
established
at
the
river
rouge
plant
coke
moves
on
from
the
ovens
by
mechanical
transmission
to
the
blast
furnaces
the
low
volatile
gases
from
the
blast
furnaces
are
piped
to
the
power
plant
boilers
where
they
are
joined
by
the
sawdust
and
the
shavings
from
the
body
plant
the
making
of
all
our
bodies
has
been
shifted
to
this
plant
and
in
addition
the
coke
breeze
the
dust
in
the
making
of
coke
is
now
also
being
utilized
for
stoking
the
steam
power
plant
is
thus
fired
almost
exclusively
from
what
would
otherwise
be
waste
products
immense
steam
turbines
directly
coupled
with
dynamos
transform
this
power
into
electricity
and
all
of
the
machinery
in
the
tractor
and
the
body
plants
is
run
by
individual
motors
from
this
electricity
in
the
course
of
time
it
is
expected
that
there
will
be
sufficient
electricity
to
run
practically
the
whole
highland
park
plant
and
we
shall
then
have
cut
out
our
coal
bill
among
the
of
the
coke
ovens
is
a
gas
it
is
piped
both
to
the
rouge
and
highland
park
plants
where
it
is
used
for
purposes
for
the
enamelling
ovens
for
the
car
ovens
and
the
like
we
formerly
had
to
buy
this
gas
the
ammonium
sulphate
is
used
for
fertilizer
the
benzol
is
a
motor
fuel
the
small
sizes
of
coke
not
suitable
for
the
blast
furnaces
are
sold
to
the
employees
delivered
free
into
their
homes
at
much
less
than
the
ordinary
market
price
the
coke
goes
to
the
blast
furnaces
there
is
no
manual
handling
we
run
the
melted
iron
directly
from
the
blast
furnaces
into
great
ladles
these
ladles
travel
into
the
shops
and
the
iron
is
poured
directly
into
the
moulds
without
another
heating
we
thus
not
only
get
a
uniform
quality
of
iron
according
to
our
own
specifications
and
directly
under
our
control
but
we
save
a
melting
of
pig
iron
and
in
fact
cut
out
a
whole
process
in
manufacturing
as
well
as
making
available
all
our
own
scrap
what
all
this
will
amount
to
in
point
of
savings
we
do
not
know
that
is
we
do
not
know
how
great
will
be
the
saving
because
the
plant
has
not
been
running
long
enough
to
give
more
than
an
indication
of
what
is
ahead
and
we
save
in
so
many
directions
in
transportation
in
the
generation
of
our
power
in
the
generation
of
gas
in
the
expense
in
casting
and
then
over
and
above
that
is
the
revenue
from
the
and
from
the
smaller
sizes
of
coke
the
investment
to
accomplish
these
objects
to
date
amounts
to
something
over
forty
million
dollars
how
far
we
shall
thus
reach
back
to
sources
depends
entirely
on
circumstances
nobody
anywhere
can
really
do
more
than
guess
about
the
future
costs
of
production
it
is
wiser
to
recognize
that
the
future
holds
more
than
the
past
that
every
day
holds
within
it
an
improvement
on
the
methods
of
the
day
before
but
how
about
production
if
every
necessary
of
life
were
produced
so
cheaply
and
in
such
quantities
would
not
the
world
shortly
be
surfeited
with
goods
will
there
not
come
a
point
when
regardless
of
price
people
simply
will
not
want
anything
more
than
what
they
already
have
and
if
in
the
process
of
manufacturing
fewer
and
fewer
men
are
used
what
is
going
to
become
of
these
men
how
are
they
going
to
find
jobs
and
live
take
the
second
point
first
we
mentioned
many
machines
and
many
methods
that
displaced
great
numbers
of
men
and
then
someone
asks
yes
that
is
a
very
fine
idea
from
the
standpoint
of
the
proprietor
but
how
about
these
poor
fellows
whose
jobs
are
taken
away
from
them
the
question
is
entirely
reasonable
but
it
is
a
little
curious
that
it
should
be
asked
for
when
were
men
ever
really
put
out
of
work
by
the
bettering
of
industrial
processes
the
drivers
lost
their
jobs
with
the
coming
of
the
railways
should
we
have
prohibited
the
railways
and
kept
the
drivers
were
there
more
men
working
with
the
than
are
working
on
the
railways
should
we
have
prevented
the
taxicab
because
its
coming
took
the
bread
out
of
the
mouths
of
the
drivers
how
does
the
number
of
taxicabs
compare
with
the
number
of
when
the
latter
were
in
their
prime
the
coming
of
shoe
machinery
closed
most
of
the
shops
of
those
who
made
shoes
by
hand
when
shoes
were
made
by
hand
only
the
very
could
own
more
than
a
single
pair
of
shoes
and
most
working
people
went
barefooted
in
summer
now
hardly
any
one
has
only
one
pair
of
shoes
and
shoe
making
is
a
great
industry
no
every
time
you
can
so
arrange
that
one
man
will
do
the
work
of
two
you
so
add
to
the
wealth
of
the
country
that
there
will
be
a
new
and
better
job
for
the
man
who
is
displaced
if
whole
industries
changed
overnight
then
disposing
of
the
surplus
men
would
be
a
problem
but
these
changes
do
not
occur
as
rapidly
as
that
they
come
gradually
in
our
own
experience
a
new
place
always
opens
for
a
man
as
soon
as
better
processes
have
taken
his
old
job
and
what
happens
in
my
shops
happens
everywhere
in
industry
there
are
many
times
more
men
employed
in
the
steel
industries
than
there
were
in
the
days
when
every
operation
was
by
hand
it
has
to
be
so
it
always
is
so
and
always
will
be
so
and
if
any
man
can
not
see
it
it
is
because
he
will
not
look
beyond
his
own
nose
now
as
to
saturation
we
are
continually
asked
when
will
you
get
to
the
point
of
overproduction
when
will
there
be
more
cars
than
people
to
use
them
we
believe
it
is
possible
some
day
to
reach
the
point
where
all
goods
are
produced
so
cheaply
and
in
such
quantities
that
overproduction
will
be
a
reality
but
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
we
do
not
look
forward
to
that
condition
with
fear
we
look
forward
to
it
with
great
satisfaction
nothing
could
be
more
splendid
than
a
world
in
which
everybody
has
all
that
he
wants
our
fear
is
that
this
condition
will
be
too
long
postponed
as
to
our
own
products
that
condition
is
very
far
away
we
do
not
know
how
many
motor
cars
a
family
will
desire
to
use
of
the
particular
kind
that
we
make
we
know
that
as
the
price
has
come
down
the
farmer
who
at
first
used
one
car
and
it
must
be
remembered
that
it
is
not
so
very
long
ago
that
the
farm
market
for
motor
cars
was
absolutely
unknown
the
limit
of
sales
was
at
that
time
fixed
by
all
the
wise
statistical
sharps
at
somewhere
near
the
number
of
millionaires
in
the
country
now
often
uses
two
and
also
he
buys
a
truck
perhaps
instead
of
sending
workmen
out
to
scattered
jobs
in
a
single
car
it
will
be
cheaper
to
send
each
worker
out
in
a
car
of
his
own
that
is
happening
with
salesmen
the
public
finds
its
own
consumptive
needs
with
unerring
accuracy
and
since
we
no
longer
make
motor
cars
or
tractors
but
merely
the
parts
which
when
assembled
become
motor
cars
and
tractors
the
facilities
as
now
provided
would
hardly
be
sufficient
to
provide
replacements
for
ten
million
cars
and
it
would
be
quite
the
same
with
any
business
we
do
not
have
to
bother
about
overproduction
for
some
years
to
come
provided
the
prices
are
right
it
is
the
refusal
of
people
to
buy
on
account
of
price
that
really
stimulates
real
business
then
if
we
want
to
do
business
we
have
to
get
the
prices
down
without
hurting
the
quality
thus
price
reduction
forces
us
to
learn
improved
and
less
wasteful
methods
of
production
one
big
part
of
the
discovery
of
what
is
normal
in
industry
depends
on
managerial
genius
discovering
better
ways
of
doing
things
if
a
man
reduces
his
selling
price
to
a
point
where
he
is
making
no
profit
or
incurring
a
loss
then
he
simply
is
forced
to
discover
how
to
make
as
good
an
article
by
a
better
method
making
his
new
method
produce
the
profit
and
not
producing
a
profit
out
of
reduced
wages
or
increased
prices
to
the
public
it
is
not
good
management
to
take
profits
out
of
the
workers
or
the
buyers
make
management
produce
the
profits
do
cheapen
the
product
do
cheapen
the
wage
do
overcharge
the
public
put
brains
into
the
method
and
more
brains
and
still
more
brains
do
things
better
than
ever
before
and
by
this
means
all
parties
to
business
are
served
and
benefited
and
all
of
this
can
always
be
done
chapter
xi
money
and
goods
the
primary
object
of
a
manufacturing
business
is
to
produce
and
if
that
objective
is
always
kept
finance
becomes
a
wholly
secondary
matter
that
has
largely
to
do
with
bookkeeping
my
own
financial
operations
have
been
very
simple
i
started
with
the
policy
of
buying
and
selling
for
cash
keeping
a
large
fund
of
cash
always
on
hand
taking
full
advantage
of
all
discounts
and
collecting
interest
on
bank
balances
i
regard
a
bank
principally
as
a
place
in
which
it
is
safe
and
convenient
to
keep
money
the
minutes
we
spend
on
a
competitor
business
we
lose
on
our
own
the
minutes
we
spend
in
becoming
expert
in
finance
we
lose
in
production
the
place
to
finance
a
manufacturing
business
is
the
shop
and
not
the
bank
i
would
not
say
that
a
man
in
business
needs
to
know
nothing
at
all
about
finance
but
he
is
better
off
knowing
too
little
than
too
much
for
if
he
becomes
too
expert
he
will
get
into
the
way
of
thinking
that
he
can
borrow
money
instead
of
earning
it
and
then
he
will
borrow
more
money
to
pay
back
what
he
has
borrowed
and
instead
of
being
a
business
man
he
will
be
a
note
juggler
trying
to
keep
in
the
air
a
regular
flock
of
bonds
and
notes
if
he
is
a
really
expert
juggler
he
may
keep
going
quite
a
long
time
in
this
fashion
but
some
day
he
is
bound
to
make
a
miss
and
the
whole
collection
will
come
tumbling
down
around
him
manufacturing
is
not
to
be
confused
with
banking
and
i
think
that
there
is
a
tendency
for
too
many
business
men
to
mix
up
in
banking
and
for
too
many
bankers
to
mix
up
in
business
the
tendency
is
to
distort
the
true
purposes
of
both
business
and
banking
and
that
hurts
both
of
them
the
money
has
to
come
out
of
the
shop
not
out
of
the
bank
and
i
have
found
that
the
shop
will
answer
every
possible
requirement
and
in
one
case
when
it
was
believed
that
the
company
was
rather
seriously
in
need
of
funds
the
shop
when
called
on
raised
a
larger
sum
than
any
bank
in
this
country
could
loan
we
have
been
thrown
into
finance
mostly
in
the
way
of
denial
some
years
back
we
had
to
keep
standing
a
denial
that
the
ford
motor
company
was
owned
by
the
standard
oil
company
and
with
that
denial
for
convenience
sake
we
coupled
a
denial
that
we
were
connected
with
any
other
concern
or
that
we
intended
to
sell
cars
by
mail
last
year
the
rumour
was
that
we
were
down
in
wall
street
hunting
for
money
i
did
not
bother
to
deny
that
it
takes
too
much
time
to
deny
everything
instead
we
demonstrated
that
we
did
not
need
any
money
since
then
i
have
heard
nothing
more
about
being
financed
by
wall
street
we
are
not
against
borrowing
money
and
we
are
not
against
bankers
we
are
against
trying
to
make
borrowed
money
take
the
place
of
work
we
are
against
the
kind
of
banker
who
regards
a
business
as
a
melon
to
be
cut
the
thing
is
to
keep
money
and
borrowing
and
finance
generally
in
their
proper
place
and
in
order
to
do
that
one
has
to
consider
exactly
for
what
the
money
is
needed
and
how
it
is
going
to
be
paid
off
money
is
only
a
tool
in
business
it
is
just
a
part
of
the
machinery
you
might
as
well
borrow
lathes
as
if
the
trouble
is
inside
your
business
more
lathes
will
not
cure
it
neither
will
more
money
only
heavier
doses
of
brains
and
thought
and
wise
courage
can
cure
a
business
that
misuses
what
it
has
will
continue
to
misuse
what
it
can
get
the
point
is
cure
the
misuse
when
that
is
done
the
business
will
begin
to
make
its
own
money
just
as
a
repaired
human
body
begins
to
make
sufficient
pure
blood
borrowing
may
easily
become
an
excuse
for
not
boring
into
the
trouble
borrowing
may
easily
become
a
sop
for
laziness
and
pride
some
business
men
are
too
lazy
to
get
into
overalls
and
go
down
to
see
what
is
the
matter
or
they
are
too
proud
to
permit
the
thought
that
anything
they
have
originated
could
go
wrong
but
the
laws
of
business
are
like
the
law
of
gravity
and
the
man
who
opposes
them
feels
their
power
borrowing
for
expansion
is
one
thing
borrowing
to
make
up
for
mismanagement
and
waste
is
quite
another
you
do
not
want
money
for
the
latter
for
the
reason
that
money
can
not
do
the
job
waste
is
corrected
by
economy
mismanagement
is
corrected
by
brains
neither
of
these
correctives
has
anything
to
do
with
money
indeed
money
under
certain
circumstances
is
their
enemy
and
many
a
business
man
thanks
his
stars
for
the
pinch
which
showed
him
that
his
best
capital
was
in
his
own
brains
and
not
in
bank
loans
borrowing
under
certain
circumstances
is
just
like
a
drunkard
taking
another
drink
to
cure
the
effect
of
the
last
one
it
does
not
do
what
it
is
expected
to
do
it
simply
increases
the
difficulty
tightening
up
the
loose
places
in
a
business
is
much
more
profitable
than
any
amount
of
new
capital
at
per
cent
the
internal
ailments
of
business
are
the
ones
that
require
most
attention
business
in
the
sense
of
trading
with
the
people
is
largely
a
matter
of
filling
the
wants
of
the
people
if
you
make
what
they
need
and
sell
it
at
a
price
which
makes
possession
a
help
and
not
a
hardship
then
you
will
do
business
as
long
as
there
is
business
to
do
people
buy
what
helps
them
just
as
naturally
as
they
drink
water
but
the
process
of
making
the
article
will
require
constant
care
machinery
wears
out
and
needs
to
be
restored
men
grow
uppish
lazy
or
careless
a
business
is
men
and
machines
united
in
the
production
of
a
commodity
and
both
the
man
and
the
machines
need
repairs
and
replacements
sometimes
it
is
the
men
higher
up
who
most
need
revamping
and
they
themselves
are
always
the
last
to
recognize
it
when
a
business
becomes
congested
with
bad
methods
when
a
business
becomes
ill
through
lack
of
attention
to
one
or
more
of
its
functions
when
executives
sit
comfortably
back
in
their
chairs
as
if
the
plans
they
inaugurated
are
going
to
keep
them
going
forever
when
business
becomes
a
mere
plantation
on
which
to
live
and
not
a
big
work
which
one
has
to
do
then
you
may
expect
trouble
you
will
wake
up
some
fine
morning
and
find
yourself
doing
more
business
than
you
have
ever
done
before
and
getting
less
out
of
it
you
find
yourself
short
of
money
you
can
borrow
money
and
you
can
do
it
oh
so
easily
people
will
crowd
money
on
you
it
is
the
most
subtle
temptation
the
young
business
man
has
but
if
you
do
borrow
money
you
are
simply
giving
a
stimulant
to
whatever
may
be
wrong
you
feed
the
disease
is
a
man
more
wise
with
borrowed
money
than
he
is
with
his
own
not
as
a
usual
thing
to
borrow
under
such
conditions
is
to
mortgage
a
declining
property
the
time
for
a
business
man
to
borrow
money
if
ever
is
when
he
does
not
need
it
that
is
when
he
does
not
need
it
as
a
substitute
for
the
things
he
ought
himself
to
do
if
a
man
business
is
in
excellent
condition
and
in
need
of
expansion
it
is
comparatively
safe
to
borrow
but
if
a
business
is
in
need
of
money
through
mismanagement
then
the
thing
to
do
is
to
get
into
the
business
and
correct
the
trouble
from
the
inside
not
poultice
it
with
loans
from
the
outside
my
financial
policy
is
the
result
of
my
sales
policy
i
hold
that
it
is
better
to
sell
a
large
number
of
articles
at
a
small
profit
than
to
sell
a
few
at
a
large
profit
this
enables
a
larger
number
of
people
to
buy
and
it
gives
a
larger
number
of
men
employment
at
good
wages
it
permits
the
planning
of
production
the
elimination
of
dull
seasons
and
the
waste
of
carrying
an
idle
plant
thus
results
a
suitable
continuous
business
and
if
you
will
think
it
over
you
will
discover
that
most
urgent
financing
is
made
necessary
because
of
a
lack
of
planned
continuous
business
reducing
prices
is
taken
by
the
to
be
the
same
as
reducing
the
income
of
a
business
it
is
very
difficult
to
deal
with
that
sort
of
a
mind
because
it
is
so
totally
lacking
in
even
the
background
knowledge
of
what
business
is
for
instance
i
was
once
asked
when
contemplating
a
reduction
of
eighty
dollars
a
car
whether
on
a
production
of
five
hundred
thousand
cars
this
would
not
reduce
the
income
of
the
company
by
forty
million
dollars
of
course
if
one
sold
only
five
hundred
thousand
cars
at
the
new
price
the
income
would
be
reduced
forty
million
dollars
which
is
an
interesting
mathematical
calculation
that
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
business
because
unless
you
reduce
the
price
of
an
article
the
sales
do
not
continuously
increase
and
therefore
the
business
has
no
stability
if
a
business
is
not
increasing
it
is
bound
to
be
decreasing
and
a
decreasing
business
always
needs
a
lot
of
financing
business
went
on
the
doctrine
that
prices
should
always
be
kept
up
to
the
highest
point
at
which
people
will
buy
really
modern
business
has
to
take
the
opposite
view
bankers
and
lawyers
can
rarely
appreciate
this
fact
they
confuse
inertia
with
stability
it
is
perfectly
beyond
their
comprehension
that
the
price
should
ever
voluntarily
be
reduced
that
is
why
putting
the
usual
type
of
banker
or
lawyer
into
the
management
of
a
business
is
courting
disaster
reducing
prices
increases
the
volume
and
disposes
of
finance
provided
one
regards
the
inevitable
profit
as
a
trust
fund
with
which
to
conduct
more
and
better
business
our
profit
because
of
the
rapidity
of
the
turnover
in
the
business
and
the
great
volume
of
sales
has
no
matter
what
the
price
at
which
the
product
was
sold
always
been
large
we
have
had
a
small
profit
per
article
but
a
large
aggregate
profit
the
profit
is
not
constant
after
cutting
the
prices
the
profits
for
a
time
run
low
but
then
the
inevitable
economies
begin
to
get
in
their
work
and
the
profits
go
high
again
but
they
are
not
distributed
as
dividends
i
have
always
insisted
on
the
payment
of
small
dividends
and
the
company
has
no
stockholders
who
wanted
a
different
policy
i
regard
business
profits
above
a
small
percentage
as
belonging
more
to
the
business
than
to
the
stockholders
the
stockholders
to
my
way
of
thinking
ought
to
be
only
those
who
are
active
in
the
business
and
who
will
regard
the
company
as
an
instrument
of
service
rather
than
as
a
machine
for
making
money
if
large
profits
are
made
and
working
to
serve
forces
them
to
be
large
then
they
should
be
in
part
turned
back
into
the
business
so
that
it
may
be
still
better
fitted
to
serve
and
in
part
passed
on
to
the
purchaser
during
one
year
our
profits
were
so
much
larger
than
we
expected
them
to
be
that
we
voluntarily
returned
fifty
dollars
to
each
purchaser
of
a
car
we
felt
that
unwittingly
we
had
overcharged
the
purchaser
by
that
much
my
price
policy
and
hence
my
financial
policy
came
up
in
a
suit
brought
against
the
company
several
years
ago
to
compel
the
payment
of
larger
dividends
on
the
witness
stand
i
gave
the
policy
then
in
force
and
which
is
still
in
force
it
is
this
in
the
first
place
i
hold
that
it
is
better
to
sell
a
large
number
of
cars
at
a
reasonably
small
margin
than
to
sell
fewer
cars
at
a
large
margin
of
profit
i
hold
this
because
it
enables
a
large
number
of
people
to
buy
and
enjoy
the
use
of
a
car
and
because
it
gives
a
larger
number
of
men
employment
at
good
wages
those
are
aims
i
have
in
life
but
i
would
not
be
counted
a
success
i
would
be
in
fact
a
flat
failure
if
i
could
not
accomplish
that
and
at
the
same
time
make
a
fair
amount
of
profit
for
myself
and
the
men
associated
with
me
in
business
this
policy
i
hold
is
good
business
policy
because
it
works
because
with
each
succeeding
year
we
have
been
able
to
put
our
car
within
the
reach
of
greater
and
greater
numbers
give
employment
to
more
and
more
men
and
at
the
same
time
through
the
volume
of
business
increase
our
own
profits
beyond
anything
we
had
hoped
for
or
even
dreamed
of
when
we
started
bear
in
mind
every
time
you
reduce
the
price
of
the
car
without
reducing
the
quality
you
increase
the
possible
number
of
purchasers
there
are
many
men
who
will
pay
for
a
car
who
would
not
pay
we
had
in
round
numbers
buyers
of
cars
on
the
basis
and
i
figure
that
on
the
basis
we
can
increase
the
sales
to
possibly
cars
for
the
year
less
profit
on
each
car
but
more
cars
more
employment
of
labour
and
in
the
end
we
shall
get
all
the
total
profit
we
ought
to
make
and
let
me
say
right
here
that
i
do
not
believe
that
we
should
make
such
an
awful
profit
on
our
cars
a
reasonable
profit
is
right
but
not
too
much
so
it
has
been
my
policy
to
force
the
price
of
the
car
down
as
fast
as
production
would
permit
and
give
the
benefits
to
users
and
labourers
with
resulting
surprisingly
enormous
benefits
to
ourselves
this
policy
does
not
agree
with
the
general
opinion
that
a
business
is
to
be
managed
to
the
end
that
the
stockholders
can
take
out
the
largest
possible
amount
of
cash
therefore
i
do
not
want
stockholders
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
term
they
do
not
help
forward
the
ability
to
serve
my
ambition
is
to
employ
more
and
more
men
and
to
spread
in
so
far
as
i
am
able
the
benefits
of
the
industrial
system
that
we
are
working
to
found
we
want
to
help
build
lives
and
homes
this
requires
that
the
largest
share
of
the
profits
be
put
back
into
productive
enterprise
hence
we
have
no
place
for
the
stockholders
the
working
stockholder
is
more
anxious
to
increase
his
opportunity
to
serve
than
to
bank
dividends
if
it
at
any
time
became
a
question
between
lowering
wages
or
abolishing
dividends
i
would
abolish
dividends
that
time
is
not
apt
to
come
for
as
i
have
pointed
out
there
is
no
economy
in
low
wages
it
is
bad
financial
policy
to
reduce
wages
because
it
also
reduces
buying
power
if
one
believes
that
leadership
brings
responsibility
then
a
part
of
that
responsibility
is
in
seeing
that
those
whom
one
leads
shall
have
an
adequate
opportunity
to
earn
a
living
finance
concerns
not
merely
the
profit
or
solvency
of
a
company
it
also
comprehends
the
amount
of
money
that
the
company
turns
back
to
the
community
through
wages
there
is
no
charity
in
this
there
is
no
charity
in
proper
wages
it
is
simply
that
no
company
can
be
said
to
be
stable
which
is
not
so
well
managed
that
it
can
afford
a
man
an
opportunity
to
do
a
great
deal
of
work
and
therefore
to
earn
a
good
wage
there
is
something
sacred
about
wages
they
represent
homes
and
families
and
domestic
destinies
people
ought
to
tread
very
carefully
when
approaching
wages
on
the
cost
sheet
wages
are
mere
figures
out
in
the
world
wages
are
bread
boxes
and
coal
bins
babies
cradles
and
children
education
family
comforts
and
contentment
on
the
other
hand
there
is
something
just
as
sacred
about
capital
which
is
used
to
provide
the
means
by
which
work
can
be
made
productive
nobody
is
helped
if
our
industries
are
sucked
dry
of
their
there
is
something
just
as
sacred
about
a
shop
that
employs
thousands
of
men
as
there
is
about
a
home
the
shop
is
the
mainstay
of
all
the
finer
things
which
the
home
represents
if
we
want
the
home
to
be
happy
we
must
contrive
to
keep
the
shop
busy
the
whole
justification
of
the
profits
made
by
the
shop
is
that
they
are
used
to
make
doubly
secure
the
homes
dependent
on
that
shop
and
to
create
more
jobs
for
other
men
if
profits
go
to
swell
a
personal
fortune
that
is
one
thing
if
they
go
to
provide
a
sounder
basis
for
business
better
working
conditions
better
wages
more
extended
employment
that
is
quite
another
thing
capital
thus
employed
should
not
be
carelessly
tampered
with
it
is
for
the
service
of
all
though
it
may
be
under
the
direction
of
one
profits
belong
in
three
places
they
belong
to
the
business
to
keep
it
steady
progressive
and
sound
they
belong
to
the
men
who
helped
produce
them
and
they
belong
also
in
part
to
the
public
a
successful
business
is
profitable
to
all
three
of
these
interests
planner
producer
and
purchaser
people
whose
profits
are
excessive
when
measured
by
any
sound
standard
should
be
the
first
to
cut
prices
but
they
never
are
they
pass
all
their
extra
costs
down
the
line
until
the
whole
burden
is
borne
by
the
consumer
and
besides
doing
that
they
charge
the
consumer
a
percentage
on
the
increased
charges
their
whole
business
philosophy
is
get
while
the
getting
is
good
they
are
the
speculators
the
exploiters
the
element
that
is
always
injuring
legitimate
business
there
is
nothing
to
be
expected
from
them
they
have
no
vision
they
can
not
see
beyond
their
own
cash
registers
these
people
can
talk
more
easily
about
a
or
per
cent
cut
in
wages
than
they
can
about
a
or
per
cent
cut
in
profits
but
a
business
man
surveying
the
whole
community
in
all
its
interests
and
wishing
to
serve
that
community
ought
to
be
able
to
make
his
contribution
to
stability
it
has
been
our
policy
always
to
keep
on
hand
a
large
amount
of
cash
the
cash
balance
in
recent
years
has
usually
been
in
excess
of
fifty
million
dollars
this
is
deposited
in
banks
all
over
the
country
we
do
not
borrow
but
we
have
established
lines
of
credit
so
that
if
we
so
cared
we
might
raise
a
very
large
amount
of
money
by
bank
borrowing
but
keeping
the
cash
reserve
makes
borrowing
unnecessary
our
provision
is
only
to
be
prepared
to
meet
an
emergency
i
have
no
prejudice
against
proper
borrowing
it
is
merely
that
i
do
not
want
to
run
the
danger
of
having
the
control
of
the
business
and
hence
the
particular
idea
of
service
to
which
i
am
devoted
taken
into
other
hands
a
considerable
part
of
finance
is
in
the
overcoming
of
seasonal
operation
the
flow
of
money
ought
to
be
nearly
continuous
one
must
work
steadily
in
order
to
work
profitably
shutting
down
involves
great
waste
it
brings
the
waste
of
unemployment
of
men
the
waste
of
unemployment
of
equipment
and
the
waste
of
restricted
future
sales
through
the
higher
prices
of
interrupted
production
that
has
been
one
of
the
problems
we
had
to
meet
we
could
not
manufacture
cars
to
stock
during
the
winter
months
when
purchases
are
less
than
in
spring
or
summer
where
or
how
could
any
one
store
half
a
million
cars
and
if
stored
how
could
they
be
shipped
in
the
rush
season
and
who
would
find
the
money
to
carry
such
a
stock
of
cars
even
if
they
could
be
stored
seasonal
work
is
hard
on
the
working
force
good
mechanics
will
not
accept
jobs
that
are
good
for
only
part
of
the
year
to
work
in
full
force
twelve
months
of
the
year
guarantees
workmen
of
ability
builds
up
a
permanent
manufacturing
organization
and
continually
improves
the
product
the
men
in
the
factory
through
uninterrupted
service
become
more
familiar
with
the
operations
the
factory
must
build
the
sales
department
must
sell
and
the
dealer
must
buy
cars
all
the
year
through
if
each
would
enjoy
the
maximum
profit
to
be
derived
from
the
business
if
the
retail
buyer
will
not
consider
purchasing
except
in
seasons
a
campaign
of
education
needs
to
be
waged
proving
the
value
of
a
car
rather
than
the
value
and
while
the
educating
is
being
done
the
manufacturer
must
build
and
the
dealer
must
buy
in
anticipation
of
business
we
were
the
first
to
meet
the
problem
in
the
automobile
business
the
selling
of
ford
cars
is
a
merchandising
proposition
in
the
days
when
every
car
was
built
to
order
and
cars
a
month
a
big
output
it
was
reasonable
to
wait
for
the
sale
before
ordering
the
manufacturer
waited
for
the
order
before
building
we
very
shortly
found
that
we
could
not
do
business
on
order
the
factory
could
not
be
built
large
enough
even
were
it
desirable
to
make
between
march
and
august
all
the
cars
that
were
ordered
during
those
months
therefore
years
ago
began
the
campaign
of
education
to
demonstrate
that
a
ford
was
not
a
summer
luxury
but
a
necessity
coupled
with
that
came
the
education
of
the
dealer
into
the
knowledge
that
even
if
he
could
not
sell
so
many
cars
in
winter
as
in
summer
it
would
pay
him
to
stock
in
winter
for
the
summer
and
thus
be
able
to
make
instant
delivery
both
plans
have
worked
out
in
most
parts
of
the
country
cars
are
used
almost
as
much
in
winter
as
in
summer
it
has
been
found
that
they
will
run
in
snow
ice
or
mud
in
anything
hence
the
winter
sales
are
constantly
growing
larger
and
the
seasonal
demand
is
in
part
lifted
from
the
dealer
and
he
finds
it
profitable
to
buy
ahead
in
anticipation
of
needs
thus
we
have
no
seasons
in
the
plant
the
production
up
until
the
last
couple
of
years
has
been
continuous
excepting
for
the
annual
shut
downs
for
inventory
we
have
had
an
interruption
during
the
period
of
extreme
depression
but
it
was
an
interruption
made
necessary
in
the
process
of
readjusting
ourselves
to
the
market
conditions
in
order
to
attain
continuous
production
and
hence
a
continuous
turning
over
of
money
we
have
had
to
plan
our
operations
with
extreme
care
the
plan
of
production
is
worked
out
very
carefully
each
month
between
the
sales
and
production
departments
with
the
object
of
producing
enough
cars
so
that
those
in
transit
will
take
care
of
the
orders
in
hand
formerly
when
we
assembled
and
shipped
cars
this
was
of
the
highest
importance
because
we
had
no
place
in
which
to
store
finished
cars
now
we
ship
parts
instead
of
cars
and
assemble
only
those
required
for
the
detroit
district
that
makes
the
planning
no
less
important
for
if
the
production
stream
and
the
order
stream
are
not
approximately
equal
we
should
be
either
jammed
with
unsold
parts
or
behind
in
our
orders
when
you
are
turning
out
the
parts
to
make
cars
a
day
just
a
very
little
carelessness
in
overestimating
orders
will
pile
up
a
finished
inventory
running
into
the
millions
that
makes
the
balancing
of
operations
an
exceedingly
delicate
matter
in
order
to
earn
the
proper
profit
on
our
narrow
margin
we
must
have
a
rapid
turnover
we
make
cars
to
sell
not
to
store
and
a
month
unsold
production
would
turn
into
a
sum
the
interest
on
which
alone
would
be
enormous
the
production
is
planned
a
year
ahead
and
the
number
of
cars
to
be
made
in
each
month
of
the
year
is
scheduled
for
of
course
it
is
a
big
problem
to
have
the
raw
materials
and
such
parts
as
we
still
buy
from
the
outside
flowing
in
consonance
with
production
we
can
no
more
afford
to
carry
large
stocks
of
finished
than
we
can
of
raw
material
everything
has
to
move
in
and
move
out
and
we
have
had
some
narrow
escapes
some
years
ago
the
plant
of
the
diamond
manufacturing
company
burned
down
they
were
making
radiator
parts
for
us
and
the
brass
parts
tubings
and
castings
we
had
to
move
quickly
or
take
a
big
loss
we
got
together
the
heads
of
all
our
departments
the
and
the
draughtsmen
they
worked
from
to
hours
on
a
stretch
they
made
new
patterns
the
diamond
company
leased
a
plant
and
got
some
machinery
in
by
express
we
furnished
the
other
equipment
for
them
and
in
twenty
days
they
were
shipping
again
we
had
enough
stock
on
hand
to
carry
us
over
say
for
seven
or
eight
days
but
that
fire
prevented
us
shipping
cars
for
ten
or
fifteen
days
except
for
our
having
stock
ahead
it
would
have
held
us
up
for
twenty
days
and
our
expenses
would
have
gone
right
on
to
repeat
the
place
in
which
to
finance
is
the
shop
it
has
never
failed
us
and
once
when
it
was
thought
that
we
were
hard
up
for
money
it
served
rather
conclusively
to
demonstrate
how
much
better
finance
can
be
conducted
from
the
inside
than
from
the
outside
chapter
xii
money
master
or
servant
in
december
business
the
country
over
was
marking
time
more
automobile
plants
were
closed
than
were
open
and
quite
a
number
of
those
which
were
closed
were
completely
in
the
charge
of
bankers
rumours
of
bad
financial
condition
were
afloat
concerning
nearly
every
industrial
company
and
i
became
interested
when
the
reports
persisted
that
the
ford
motor
company
not
only
needed
money
but
could
not
get
it
i
have
become
accustomed
to
all
kinds
of
rumours
about
our
company
so
much
so
that
nowadays
i
rarely
deny
any
sort
of
rumour
but
these
reports
differed
from
all
previous
ones
they
were
so
exact
and
circumstantial
i
learned
that
i
had
overcome
my
prejudice
against
borrowing
and
that
i
might
be
found
almost
any
day
down
in
wall
street
hat
in
hand
asking
for
money
and
rumour
went
even
further
and
said
that
no
one
would
give
me
money
and
that
i
might
have
to
break
up
and
go
out
of
business
it
is
true
that
we
did
have
a
problem
in
we
had
borrowed
on
notes
to
buy
the
full
stock
interest
in
the
ford
motor
company
on
this
we
had
left
to
pay
we
had
in
income
taxes
due
or
shortly
to
become
due
to
the
government
and
also
we
intended
to
pay
our
usual
bonus
for
the
year
to
the
workmen
which
amounted
to
altogether
between
january
and
april
we
had
payments
ahead
totaling
we
had
only
in
bank
our
balance
sheet
was
more
or
less
common
knowledge
and
i
suppose
it
was
taken
for
granted
that
we
could
not
raise
the
needed
without
borrowing
for
that
is
quite
a
large
sum
of
money
without
the
aid
of
wall
street
such
a
sum
could
not
easily
and
quickly
be
raised
we
were
perfectly
good
for
the
money
two
years
before
we
had
borrowed
and
since
our
whole
property
was
unencumbered
and
we
had
no
commercial
debts
the
matter
of
lending
a
large
sum
to
us
would
not
ordinarily
have
been
a
matter
of
moment
in
fact
it
would
have
been
good
banking
business
however
i
began
to
see
that
our
need
for
money
was
being
industriously
circulated
as
an
evidence
of
impending
failure
then
i
began
to
suspect
that
although
the
rumours
came
in
news
dispatches
from
all
over
the
country
they
might
perhaps
be
traced
to
a
single
source
this
belief
was
further
strengthened
when
we
were
informed
that
a
very
fat
financial
editor
was
at
battle
creek
sending
out
bulletins
concerning
the
acuteness
of
our
financial
condition
therefore
i
took
care
not
to
deny
a
single
rumour
we
had
made
our
financial
plans
and
they
did
not
include
borrowing
money
i
can
not
too
greatly
emphasize
that
the
very
worst
time
to
borrow
money
is
when
the
banking
people
think
that
you
need
money
in
the
last
chapter
i
outlined
our
financial
principles
we
simply
applied
those
principles
we
planned
a
thorough
go
back
a
bit
and
see
what
the
conditions
were
along
in
the
early
part
of
came
the
first
indications
that
the
feverish
speculative
business
engendered
by
the
war
was
not
going
to
continue
a
few
concerns
that
had
sprung
out
of
the
war
and
had
no
real
reason
for
existence
failed
people
slowed
down
in
their
buying
our
own
sales
kept
right
along
but
we
knew
that
sooner
or
later
they
would
drop
off
i
thought
seriously
of
cutting
prices
but
the
costs
of
manufacturing
everywhere
were
out
of
control
labour
gave
less
and
less
in
return
for
high
wages
the
suppliers
of
raw
material
refused
even
to
think
of
coming
back
to
earth
the
very
plain
warnings
of
the
storm
went
quite
unheeded
in
june
our
own
sales
began
to
be
affected
they
grew
less
and
less
each
month
from
june
on
until
september
we
had
to
do
something
to
bring
our
product
within
the
purchasing
power
of
the
public
and
not
only
that
we
had
to
do
something
drastic
enough
to
demonstrate
to
the
public
that
we
were
actually
playing
the
game
and
not
just
shamming
therefore
in
september
we
cut
the
price
of
the
touring
car
from
to
we
cut
the
price
far
below
the
cost
of
production
for
we
were
still
making
from
stock
bought
at
boom
prices
the
cut
created
a
considerable
sensation
we
received
a
deal
of
criticism
it
was
said
that
we
were
disturbing
conditions
that
is
exactly
what
we
were
trying
to
do
we
wanted
to
do
our
part
in
bringing
prices
from
an
artificial
to
a
natural
level
i
am
firmly
of
the
opinion
that
if
at
this
time
or
earlier
manufacturers
and
distributors
had
all
made
drastic
cuts
in
their
prices
and
had
put
through
thorough
we
should
not
have
so
long
a
business
depression
hanging
on
in
the
hope
of
getting
higher
prices
simply
delayed
adjustment
nobody
got
the
higher
prices
they
hoped
for
and
if
the
losses
had
been
taken
all
at
once
not
only
would
the
productive
and
the
buying
powers
of
the
country
have
become
harmonized
but
we
should
have
been
saved
this
long
period
of
general
idleness
hanging
on
in
the
hope
of
higher
prices
merely
made
the
losses
greater
because
those
who
hung
on
had
to
pay
interest
on
their
stocks
and
also
lost
the
profits
they
might
have
made
by
working
on
a
sensible
basis
unemployment
cut
down
wage
distribution
and
thus
the
buyer
and
the
seller
became
more
and
more
separated
there
was
a
lot
of
flurried
talk
of
arranging
to
give
vast
credits
to
europe
the
idea
being
that
thereby
the
stocks
might
be
palmed
off
of
course
the
proposals
were
not
put
in
any
such
crude
fashion
and
i
think
that
quite
a
lot
of
people
sincerely
believed
that
if
large
credits
were
extended
abroad
even
without
a
hope
of
the
payment
of
either
principal
or
interest
american
business
would
somehow
be
benefited
it
is
true
that
if
these
credits
were
taken
by
american
banks
those
who
had
stocks
might
have
gotten
rid
of
them
at
a
profit
but
the
banks
would
have
acquired
so
much
frozen
credit
that
they
would
have
more
nearly
resembled
ice
houses
than
banks
i
suppose
it
is
natural
to
hang
on
to
the
possibility
of
profits
until
the
very
last
moment
but
it
is
not
good
business
our
own
sales
after
the
cut
increased
but
soon
they
began
to
fall
off
again
we
were
not
sufficiently
within
the
purchasing
power
of
the
country
to
make
buying
easy
retail
prices
generally
had
not
touched
bottom
the
public
distrusted
all
prices
we
laid
our
plans
for
another
cut
and
we
kept
our
production
around
one
hundred
thousand
cars
a
month
this
production
was
not
justified
by
our
sales
but
we
wanted
to
have
as
much
as
possible
of
our
raw
material
transformed
into
finished
product
before
we
shut
down
we
knew
that
we
would
have
to
shut
down
in
order
to
take
an
inventory
and
clean
house
we
wanted
to
open
with
another
big
cut
and
to
have
cars
on
hand
to
supply
the
demand
then
the
new
cars
could
be
built
out
of
material
bought
at
lower
prices
we
determined
that
we
were
going
to
get
lower
prices
we
shut
down
in
december
with
the
intention
of
opening
again
in
about
two
weeks
we
found
so
much
to
do
that
actually
we
did
not
open
for
nearly
six
weeks
the
moment
that
we
shut
down
the
rumours
concerning
our
financial
condition
became
more
and
more
active
i
know
that
a
great
many
people
hoped
that
we
should
have
to
go
out
after
money
for
were
we
seeking
money
then
we
should
have
to
come
to
terms
we
did
not
ask
for
money
we
did
not
want
money
we
had
one
offer
of
money
an
officer
of
a
new
york
bank
called
on
me
with
a
financial
plan
which
included
a
large
loan
and
in
which
also
was
an
arrangement
by
which
a
representative
of
the
bankers
would
act
as
treasurer
and
take
charge
of
the
finance
of
the
company
those
people
meant
well
enough
i
am
quite
sure
we
did
not
want
to
borrow
money
but
it
so
happened
that
at
the
moment
we
were
without
a
treasurer
to
that
extent
the
bankers
had
envisaged
our
condition
correctly
i
asked
my
son
edsel
to
be
treasurer
as
well
as
president
of
the
company
that
fixed
us
up
as
to
a
treasurer
so
there
was
really
nothing
at
all
that
the
bankers
could
do
for
us
then
we
began
our
during
the
war
we
had
gone
into
many
kinds
of
war
work
and
had
thus
been
forced
to
depart
from
our
principle
of
a
single
product
this
had
caused
many
new
departments
to
be
added
the
office
force
had
expanded
and
much
of
the
wastefulness
of
scattered
production
had
crept
in
war
work
is
rush
work
and
is
wasteful
work
we
began
throwing
out
everything
that
did
not
contribute
to
the
production
of
cars
the
only
immediate
payment
scheduled
was
the
purely
voluntary
one
of
a
bonus
to
our
workmen
there
was
no
obligation
to
pay
but
we
wanted
to
pay
on
the
first
of
january
that
we
paid
out
of
our
cash
on
hand
throughout
the
country
we
have
branches
these
are
all
assembling
plants
but
in
of
them
parts
are
also
manufactured
they
had
stopped
the
making
of
parts
but
they
went
on
assembling
cars
at
the
time
of
shutting
down
we
had
practically
no
cars
in
detroit
we
had
shipped
out
all
the
parts
and
during
january
the
detroit
dealers
actually
had
to
go
as
far
a
field
as
chicago
and
columbus
to
get
cars
for
local
needs
the
branches
shipped
to
each
dealer
under
his
yearly
quota
enough
cars
to
cover
about
a
sales
the
dealers
worked
hard
on
sales
during
the
latter
part
of
january
we
called
in
a
skeleton
organization
of
about
ten
thousand
men
mostly
foremen
and
straw
bosses
and
we
started
highland
park
into
production
we
collected
our
foreign
accounts
and
sold
our
then
we
were
ready
for
full
production
and
gradually
into
full
production
we
went
on
a
profitable
basis
the
swept
out
the
waste
that
had
both
made
the
prices
high
and
absorbed
the
profit
we
sold
off
the
useless
stuff
before
we
had
employed
fifteen
men
per
car
per
day
afterward
we
employed
nine
per
car
per
day
this
did
not
mean
that
six
out
of
fifteen
men
lost
their
jobs
they
only
ceased
being
unproductive
we
made
that
cut
by
applying
the
rule
that
everything
and
everybody
must
produce
or
get
out
we
cut
our
office
forces
in
halves
and
offered
the
office
workers
better
jobs
in
the
shops
most
of
them
took
the
jobs
we
abolished
every
order
blank
and
every
form
of
statistics
that
did
not
directly
aid
in
the
production
of
a
car
we
had
been
collecting
tons
of
statistics
because
they
were
interesting
but
statistics
will
not
construct
automobiles
so
out
they
went
we
took
out
per
cent
of
our
telephone
extensions
only
a
comparatively
few
men
in
any
organization
need
telephones
we
formerly
had
a
foreman
for
every
five
men
now
we
have
a
foreman
for
every
twenty
men
the
other
foremen
are
working
on
machines
we
cut
the
overhead
charge
from
a
car
to
a
car
and
when
you
realize
what
this
means
on
more
than
four
thousand
cars
a
day
you
will
have
an
idea
how
not
by
economy
not
by
but
by
the
elimination
of
waste
it
is
possible
to
make
an
impossible
price
most
important
of
all
we
found
out
how
to
use
less
money
in
our
business
by
speeding
up
the
turnover
and
in
increasing
the
turnover
rate
one
of
the
most
important
factors
was
the
detroit
toledo
ironton
railroad
which
we
purchased
the
railroad
took
a
large
place
in
the
scheme
of
economy
to
the
road
itself
i
have
given
another
chapter
we
discovered
after
a
little
experimenting
that
freight
service
could
be
improved
sufficiently
to
reduce
the
cycle
of
manufacture
from
to
fourteen
days
that
is
raw
material
could
be
bought
manufactured
and
the
finished
product
put
into
the
hands
of
the
distributor
in
roughly
per
cent
less
time
than
before
we
had
been
carrying
an
inventory
of
around
to
insure
uninterrupted
production
cutting
down
the
time
one
third
released
or
a
year
in
interest
counting
the
finished
inventory
we
saved
approximately
more
that
is
we
were
able
to
release
in
capital
and
save
the
interest
on
that
sum
on
january
we
had
on
april
we
had
or
more
than
we
needed
to
wipe
out
all
our
indebtedness
that
is
what
boring
into
the
business
did
for
us
this
amount
came
to
us
in
these
items
cash
on
hand
january
stock
on
hand
turned
into
cash
january
to
april
speeding
up
transit
of
goods
released
collected
from
agents
in
foreign
countries
sale
of
sale
of
liberty
bonds
total
now
i
have
told
about
all
this
not
in
the
way
of
an
exploit
but
to
point
out
how
a
business
may
find
resources
within
itself
instead
of
borrowing
and
also
to
start
a
little
thinking
as
to
whether
the
form
of
our
money
may
not
put
a
premium
on
borrowing
and
thus
give
far
too
great
a
place
in
life
to
the
bankers
we
could
have
borrowed
more
had
we
wanted
to
suppose
we
had
borrowed
what
would
have
happened
should
we
have
been
better
fitted
to
go
on
with
our
business
or
worse
fitted
if
we
had
borrowed
we
should
not
have
been
under
the
necessity
of
finding
methods
to
cheapen
production
had
we
been
able
to
obtain
the
money
at
per
cent
flat
and
we
should
in
commissions
and
the
like
have
had
to
pay
more
than
that
the
interest
charge
alone
on
a
yearly
production
of
cars
would
have
amounted
to
about
four
dollars
a
car
therefore
we
should
now
be
without
the
benefit
of
better
production
and
loaded
with
a
heavy
debt
our
cars
would
probably
cost
about
one
hundred
dollars
more
than
they
do
hence
we
should
have
a
smaller
production
for
we
could
not
have
so
many
buyers
we
should
employ
fewer
men
and
in
short
should
not
be
able
to
serve
to
the
utmost
you
will
note
that
the
financiers
proposed
to
cure
by
lending
money
and
not
by
bettering
methods
they
did
not
suggest
putting
in
an
engineer
they
wanted
to
put
in
a
treasurer
and
that
is
the
danger
of
having
bankers
in
business
they
think
solely
in
terms
of
money
they
think
of
a
factory
as
making
money
not
goods
they
want
to
watch
the
money
not
the
efficiency
of
production
they
can
not
comprehend
that
a
business
never
stands
still
it
must
go
forward
or
go
back
they
regard
a
reduction
in
prices
as
a
throwing
away
of
profit
instead
of
as
a
building
of
business
bankers
play
far
too
great
a
part
in
the
conduct
of
industry
most
business
men
will
privately
admit
that
fact
they
will
seldom
publicly
admit
it
because
they
are
afraid
of
their
bankers
it
required
less
skill
to
make
a
fortune
dealing
in
money
than
dealing
in
production
the
average
successful
banker
is
by
no
means
so
intelligent
and
resourceful
a
man
as
is
the
average
successful
business
man
yet
the
banker
through
his
control
of
credit
practically
controls
the
average
business
man
there
has
been
a
great
reaching
out
by
bankers
in
the
last
fifteen
or
twenty
years
and
especially
since
the
war
and
the
federal
reserve
system
for
a
time
put
into
their
hands
an
almost
limitless
supply
of
credit
the
banker
is
as
i
have
noted
by
training
and
because
of
his
position
totally
unsuited
to
the
conduct
of
industry
if
therefore
the
controllers
of
credit
have
lately
acquired
this
very
large
power
is
it
not
to
be
taken
as
a
sign
that
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
financial
system
that
gives
to
finance
instead
of
to
service
the
predominant
power
in
industry
it
was
not
the
industrial
acumen
of
the
bankers
that
brought
them
into
the
management
of
industry
everyone
will
admit
that
they
were
pushed
there
by
the
system
itself
therefore
i
personally
want
to
discover
whether
we
are
operating
under
the
best
financial
system
now
let
me
say
at
once
that
my
objection
to
bankers
has
nothing
to
do
with
personalities
i
am
not
against
bankers
as
such
we
stand
very
much
in
need
of
thoughtful
men
skilled
in
finance
the
world
can
not
go
on
without
banking
facilities
we
have
to
have
money
we
have
to
have
credit
otherwise
the
fruits
of
production
could
not
be
exchanged
we
have
to
have
capital
without
it
there
could
be
no
production
but
whether
we
have
based
our
banking
and
our
credit
on
the
right
foundation
is
quite
another
matter
it
is
no
part
of
my
thought
to
attack
our
financial
system
i
am
not
in
the
position
of
one
who
has
been
beaten
by
the
system
and
wants
revenge
it
does
not
make
the
least
difference
to
me
personally
what
bankers
do
because
we
have
been
able
to
manage
our
affairs
without
outside
financial
aid
my
inquiry
is
prompted
by
no
personal
motive
whatsoever
i
only
want
to
know
whether
the
greatest
good
is
being
rendered
to
the
greatest
number
no
financial
system
is
good
which
favors
one
class
of
producers
over
another
we
want
to
discover
whether
it
is
not
possible
to
take
away
power
which
is
not
based
on
wealth
creation
any
sort
of
class
legislation
is
pernicious
i
think
that
the
country
production
has
become
so
changed
in
its
methods
that
gold
is
not
the
best
medium
with
which
it
may
be
measured
and
that
the
gold
standard
as
a
control
of
credit
gives
as
it
is
now
and
i
believe
inevitably
administered
class
advantage
the
ultimate
check
on
credit
is
the
amount
of
gold
in
the
country
regardless
of
the
amount
of
wealth
in
the
country
i
am
not
prepared
to
dogmatize
on
the
subject
of
money
or
credit
as
far
as
money
and
credit
are
concerned
no
one
as
yet
knows
enough
about
them
to
dogmatize
the
whole
question
will
have
to
be
settled
as
all
other
questions
of
real
importance
have
to
be
settled
and
that
is
by
cautious
experiment
and
i
am
not
inclined
to
go
beyond
cautious
experiments
we
have
to
proceed
step
by
step
and
very
carefully
the
question
is
not
political
it
is
economic
and
i
am
perfectly
certain
that
helping
the
people
to
think
on
the
question
is
wholly
advantageous
they
will
not
act
without
adequate
knowledge
and
thus
cause
disaster
if
a
sincere
effort
is
made
to
provide
them
with
knowledge
the
money
question
has
first
place
in
multitudes
of
minds
of
all
degrees
or
power
but
a
glance
at
most
of
the
systems
shows
how
contradictory
they
are
the
majority
of
them
make
the
assumption
of
honesty
among
mankind
to
begin
with
and
that
of
course
is
a
prime
defect
even
our
present
system
would
work
splendidly
if
all
men
were
honest
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
whole
money
question
is
per
cent
human
nature
and
your
successful
system
must
check
human
nature
not
depend
upon
it
the
people
are
thinking
about
the
money
question
and
if
the
money
masters
have
any
information
which
they
think
the
people
ought
to
have
to
prevent
them
going
astray
now
is
the
time
to
give
it
the
days
are
fast
slipping
away
when
the
fear
of
credit
curtailment
will
avail
or
when
wordy
slogans
will
affright
the
people
are
naturally
conservative
they
are
more
conservative
than
the
financiers
those
who
believe
that
the
people
are
so
easily
led
that
they
would
permit
printing
presses
to
run
off
money
like
milk
tickets
do
not
understand
them
it
is
the
innate
conservation
of
the
people
that
has
kept
our
money
good
in
spite
of
the
fantastic
tricks
which
the
financiers
play
and
which
they
cover
up
with
high
technical
terms
the
people
are
on
the
side
of
sound
money
they
are
so
unalterably
on
the
side
of
sound
money
that
it
is
a
serious
question
how
they
would
regard
the
system
under
which
they
live
if
they
once
knew
what
the
initiated
can
do
with
it
the
present
money
system
is
not
going
to
be
changed
by
or
political
sensationalism
or
economic
experiment
it
is
going
to
change
under
the
pressure
of
conditions
conditions
that
we
can
not
control
and
pressure
that
we
can
not
control
these
conditions
are
now
with
us
that
pressure
is
now
upon
us
the
people
must
be
helped
to
think
naturally
about
money
they
must
be
told
what
it
is
and
what
makes
it
money
and
what
are
the
possible
tricks
of
the
present
system
which
put
nations
and
peoples
under
control
of
the
few
money
after
all
is
extremely
simple
it
is
a
part
of
our
transportation
system
it
is
a
simple
and
direct
method
of
conveying
goods
from
one
person
to
another
money
is
in
itself
most
admirable
it
is
essential
it
is
not
intrinsically
evil
it
is
one
of
the
most
useful
devices
in
social
life
and
when
it
does
what
it
was
intended
to
do
it
is
all
help
and
no
hindrance
but
money
should
always
be
money
a
foot
is
always
twelve
inches
but
when
is
a
dollar
a
dollar
if
ton
weights
changed
in
the
coal
yard
and
peck
measures
changed
in
the
grocery
and
yard
sticks
were
inches
and
inches
by
some
occult
process
called
exchange
the
people
would
mighty
soon
remedy
that
when
a
dollar
is
not
always
a
dollar
when
the
dollar
becomes
the
dollar
and
then
the
dollar
and
then
the
dollar
as
the
good
old
american
gold
and
silver
dollars
did
what
is
the
use
of
yelling
about
cheap
money
depreciated
money
a
dollar
that
stays
cents
is
as
necessary
as
a
pound
that
stays
ounces
and
a
yard
that
stays
inches
the
bankers
who
do
straight
banking
should
regard
themselves
as
naturally
the
first
men
to
probe
and
understand
our
monetary
system
instead
of
being
content
with
the
mastery
of
local
methods
and
if
they
would
deprive
the
gamblers
in
bank
balances
of
the
name
of
banker
and
oust
them
once
for
all
from
the
place
of
influence
which
that
name
gives
them
banking
would
be
restored
and
established
as
the
public
service
it
ought
to
be
and
the
iniquities
of
the
present
monetary
system
and
financial
devices
would
be
lifted
from
the
shoulders
of
the
people
there
is
an
if
here
of
course
but
it
is
not
insurmountable
affairs
are
coming
to
a
jam
as
it
is
and
if
those
who
possess
technical
facility
do
not
engage
to
remedy
the
case
those
who
lack
that
facility
may
attempt
it
nothing
is
more
foolish
than
for
any
class
to
assume
that
progress
is
an
attack
upon
it
progress
is
only
a
call
made
upon
it
to
lend
its
experience
for
the
general
advancement
it
is
only
those
who
are
unwise
who
will
attempt
to
obstruct
progress
and
thereby
become
its
victims
all
of
us
are
here
together
all
of
us
must
go
forward
together
it
is
perfectly
silly
for
any
man
or
class
to
take
umbrage
at
the
stirring
of
progress
if
financiers
feel
that
progress
is
only
the
restlessness
of
persons
if
they
regard
all
suggestions
of
betterment
as
a
personal
slap
then
they
are
taking
the
part
which
proves
more
than
anything
else
could
their
unfitness
to
continue
in
their
leadership
if
the
present
faulty
system
is
more
profitable
to
a
financier
than
a
more
perfect
system
would
be
and
if
that
financier
values
his
few
remaining
years
of
personal
profits
more
highly
than
he
would
value
the
honour
of
making
a
contribution
to
the
life
of
the
world
by
helping
to
erect
a
better
system
then
there
is
no
way
of
preventing
a
clash
of
interests
but
it
is
fair
to
say
to
the
selfish
financial
interests
that
if
their
fight
is
waged
to
perpetuate
a
system
just
because
it
profits
them
then
their
fight
is
already
lost
why
should
finance
fear
the
world
will
still
be
here
men
will
do
business
with
one
another
there
will
be
money
and
there
will
be
need
of
masters
of
the
mechanism
of
money
nothing
is
going
to
depart
but
the
knots
and
tangles
there
will
be
some
readjustments
of
course
banks
will
no
longer
be
the
masters
of
industry
they
will
be
the
servants
of
industry
business
will
control
money
instead
of
money
controlling
business
the
ruinous
interest
system
will
be
greatly
modified
banking
will
not
be
a
risk
but
a
service
banks
will
begin
to
do
much
more
for
the
people
than
they
do
now
and
instead
of
being
the
most
expensive
businesses
in
the
world
to
manage
and
the
most
highly
profitable
in
the
matter
of
dividends
they
will
become
less
costly
and
the
profits
of
their
operation
will
go
to
the
community
which
they
serve
two
facts
of
the
old
order
are
fundamental
first
that
within
the
nation
itself
the
tendency
of
financial
control
is
toward
its
largest
centralized
banking
institutions
either
a
government
bank
or
a
closely
allied
group
of
private
financiers
there
is
always
in
every
nation
a
definite
control
of
credit
by
private
or
interests
second
in
the
world
as
a
whole
the
same
centralizing
tendency
is
operative
an
american
credit
is
under
control
of
new
york
interests
as
before
the
war
world
credit
was
controlled
in
london
the
british
pound
sterling
was
the
standard
of
exchange
for
the
world
trade
two
methods
of
reform
are
open
to
us
one
beginning
at
the
bottom
and
one
beginning
at
the
top
the
latter
is
the
more
orderly
way
the
former
is
being
tried
in
russia
if
our
reform
should
begin
at
the
top
it
will
require
a
social
vision
and
an
altruistic
fervour
of
a
sincerity
and
intensity
which
is
wholly
inconsistent
with
selfish
shrewdness
the
wealth
of
the
world
neither
consists
in
nor
is
adequately
represented
by
the
money
of
the
world
gold
itself
is
not
a
valuable
commodity
it
is
no
more
wealth
than
hat
checks
are
hats
but
it
can
be
so
manipulated
as
the
sign
of
wealth
as
to
give
its
owners
or
controllers
the
over
the
credit
which
producers
of
real
wealth
require
dealing
in
money
the
commodity
of
exchange
is
a
very
lucrative
business
when
money
itself
becomes
an
article
of
commerce
to
be
bought
and
sold
before
real
wealth
can
be
moved
or
exchanged
the
usurers
and
speculators
are
thereby
permitted
to
lay
a
tax
on
production
the
hold
which
controllers
of
money
are
able
to
maintain
on
productive
forces
is
seen
to
be
more
powerful
when
it
is
remembered
that
although
money
is
supposed
to
represent
the
real
wealth
of
the
world
there
is
always
much
more
wealth
than
there
is
money
and
real
wealth
is
often
compelled
to
wait
upon
money
thus
leading
to
that
most
paradoxical
situation
a
world
filled
with
wealth
but
suffering
want
these
facts
are
not
merely
fiscal
to
be
cast
into
figures
and
left
there
they
are
instinct
with
human
destiny
and
they
bleed
the
poverty
of
the
world
is
seldom
caused
by
lack
of
goods
but
by
a
money
stringency
commercial
competition
between
nations
which
leads
to
international
rivalry
and
which
in
their
turn
breed
wars
these
are
some
of
the
human
significations
of
these
facts
thus
poverty
and
war
two
great
preventable
evils
grow
on
a
single
stem
let
us
see
if
a
beginning
toward
a
better
method
can
not
be
made
chapter
xiii
why
be
poor
poverty
springs
from
a
number
of
sources
the
more
important
of
which
are
controllable
so
does
special
privilege
i
think
it
is
entirely
feasible
to
abolish
both
poverty
and
special
privilege
and
there
can
be
no
question
but
that
their
abolition
is
desirable
both
are
unnatural
but
it
is
work
not
law
to
which
we
must
look
for
results
by
poverty
i
mean
the
lack
of
reasonably
sufficient
food
housing
and
clothing
for
an
individual
or
a
family
there
will
have
to
be
differences
in
the
grades
of
sustenance
men
are
not
equal
in
mentality
or
in
physique
any
plan
which
starts
with
the
assumption
that
men
are
or
ought
to
be
equal
is
unnatural
and
therefore
unworkable
there
can
be
no
feasible
or
desirable
process
of
leveling
down
such
a
course
only
promotes
poverty
by
making
it
universal
instead
of
exceptional
forcing
the
efficient
producer
to
become
inefficient
does
not
make
the
inefficient
producer
more
efficient
poverty
can
be
done
away
with
only
by
plenty
and
we
have
now
gone
far
enough
along
in
the
science
of
production
to
be
able
to
see
as
a
natural
development
the
day
when
production
and
distribution
will
be
so
scientific
that
all
may
have
according
to
ability
and
industry
the
extreme
socialists
went
wide
of
the
mark
in
their
reasoning
that
industry
would
inevitably
crush
the
worker
modern
industry
is
gradually
lifting
the
worker
and
the
world
we
only
need
to
know
more
about
planning
and
methods
the
best
results
can
and
will
be
brought
about
by
individual
initiative
and
ingenuity
by
intelligent
individual
leadership
the
government
because
it
is
essentially
negative
can
not
give
positive
aid
to
any
really
constructive
programme
it
can
give
negative
aid
by
removing
obstructions
to
progress
and
by
ceasing
to
be
a
burden
upon
the
community
the
underlying
causes
of
poverty
as
i
can
see
them
are
essentially
due
to
the
bad
adjustment
between
production
and
distribution
in
both
industry
and
agriculture
between
the
source
of
power
and
its
application
the
wastes
due
to
lack
of
adjustment
are
stupendous
all
of
these
wastes
must
fall
before
intelligent
leadership
consecrated
to
service
so
long
as
leadership
thinks
more
of
money
than
it
does
of
service
the
wastes
will
continue
waste
is
prevented
by
not
by
men
men
think
first
of
money
they
can
not
see
waste
they
think
of
service
as
altruistic
instead
of
as
the
most
practical
thing
in
the
world
they
can
not
get
far
enough
away
from
the
little
things
to
see
the
big
things
to
see
the
biggest
thing
of
all
which
is
that
opportunist
production
from
a
purely
money
standpoint
is
the
least
profitable
service
can
be
based
upon
altruism
but
that
sort
of
service
is
not
usually
the
best
the
sentimental
trips
up
the
practical
it
is
not
that
the
industrial
enterprises
are
unable
fairly
to
distribute
a
share
of
the
wealth
which
they
create
it
is
simply
that
the
waste
is
so
great
that
there
is
not
a
sufficient
share
for
everyone
engaged
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
product
is
usually
sold
at
so
high
a
price
as
to
restrict
its
fullest
consumption
take
some
of
the
wastes
take
the
wastes
of
power
the
mississippi
valley
is
without
coal
through
its
centre
pour
many
millions
of
potential
horsepower
the
mississippi
river
but
if
the
people
by
its
banks
want
power
or
heat
they
buy
coal
that
has
been
hauled
hundreds
of
miles
and
consequently
has
to
be
sold
at
far
above
its
worth
as
heat
or
power
or
if
they
can
not
afford
to
buy
this
expensive
coal
they
go
out
and
cut
down
trees
thereby
depriving
themselves
of
one
of
the
great
conservers
of
water
power
until
recently
they
never
thought
of
the
power
at
hand
which
at
next
to
nothing
beyond
the
initial
cost
could
heat
light
cook
and
work
for
the
huge
population
which
that
valley
is
destined
to
support
the
cure
of
poverty
is
not
in
personal
economy
but
in
better
production
the
thrift
and
economy
ideas
have
been
overworked
the
word
economy
represents
a
fear
the
great
and
tragic
fact
of
waste
is
impressed
on
a
mind
by
some
circumstance
usually
of
a
most
materialistic
kind
there
comes
a
violent
reaction
against
extravagance
the
mind
catches
hold
of
the
idea
of
economy
but
it
only
flies
from
a
greater
to
a
lesser
evil
it
does
not
make
the
full
journey
from
error
to
truth
economy
is
the
rule
of
minds
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
is
better
than
waste
neither
can
there
be
any
doubt
that
it
is
not
as
good
as
use
people
who
pride
themselves
on
their
economy
take
it
as
a
virtue
but
what
is
more
pitiable
than
a
poor
pinched
mind
spending
the
rich
days
and
years
clutching
a
few
bits
of
metal
what
can
be
fine
about
paring
the
necessities
of
life
to
the
very
quick
we
all
know
economical
people
who
seem
to
be
niggardly
even
about
the
amount
of
air
they
breathe
and
the
amount
of
appreciation
they
will
allow
themselves
to
give
to
anything
they
shrivel
body
and
soul
economy
is
waste
it
is
waste
of
the
juices
of
life
the
sap
of
living
for
there
are
two
kinds
of
waste
that
of
the
prodigal
who
throws
his
substance
away
in
riotous
living
and
that
of
the
sluggard
who
allows
his
substance
to
rot
from
the
rigid
economizer
is
in
danger
of
being
classed
with
the
sluggard
extravagance
is
usually
a
reaction
from
suppression
of
expenditure
economy
is
likely
to
be
a
reaction
from
extravagance
everything
was
given
us
to
use
there
is
no
evil
from
which
we
suffer
that
did
not
come
about
through
misuse
the
worst
sin
we
can
commit
against
the
things
of
our
common
life
is
to
misuse
them
misuse
is
the
wider
term
we
like
to
say
waste
but
waste
is
only
one
phase
of
misuse
all
waste
is
misuse
all
misuse
is
waste
it
is
possible
even
to
overemphasize
the
saving
habit
it
is
proper
and
desirable
that
everyone
have
a
margin
it
is
really
wasteful
not
to
have
one
if
you
can
have
one
but
it
can
be
overdone
we
teach
children
to
save
their
money
as
an
attempt
to
counteract
thoughtless
and
selfish
expenditure
that
has
a
value
but
it
is
not
positive
it
does
not
lead
the
child
out
into
the
safe
and
useful
avenues
of
or
to
teach
a
child
to
invest
and
use
is
better
than
to
teach
him
to
save
most
men
who
are
laboriously
saving
a
few
dollars
would
do
better
to
invest
those
few
dollars
first
in
themselves
and
then
in
some
useful
work
eventually
they
would
have
more
to
save
young
men
ought
to
invest
rather
than
save
they
ought
to
invest
in
themselves
to
increase
creative
value
after
they
have
taken
themselves
to
the
peak
of
usefulness
then
will
be
time
enough
to
think
of
laying
aside
as
a
fixed
policy
a
certain
substantial
share
of
income
you
are
not
saving
when
you
prevent
yourself
from
becoming
more
productive
you
are
really
taking
away
from
your
ultimate
capital
you
are
reducing
the
value
of
one
of
nature
investments
the
principle
of
use
is
the
true
guide
use
is
positive
active
use
is
alive
use
adds
to
the
sum
of
good
personal
want
may
be
avoided
without
changing
the
general
condition
wage
increases
price
increases
profit
increases
other
kinds
of
increases
designed
to
bring
more
money
here
or
money
there
are
only
attempts
of
this
or
that
class
to
get
out
of
the
fire
regardless
of
what
may
happen
to
everyone
else
there
is
a
foolish
belief
that
if
only
the
money
can
be
gotten
somehow
the
storm
can
be
weathered
labour
believes
that
if
it
can
get
more
wages
it
can
weather
the
storm
capital
thinks
that
if
it
can
get
more
profits
it
can
weather
the
storm
there
is
a
pathetic
faith
in
what
money
can
do
money
is
very
useful
in
normal
times
but
money
has
no
more
value
than
the
people
put
into
it
by
production
and
it
can
be
so
misused
it
can
be
so
superstitiously
worshipped
as
a
substitute
for
real
wealth
as
to
destroy
its
value
altogether
the
idea
persists
that
there
exists
an
essential
conflict
between
industry
and
the
farm
there
is
no
such
conflict
it
is
nonsense
to
say
that
because
the
cities
are
overcrowded
everybody
ought
to
go
back
to
the
farm
if
everybody
did
so
farming
would
soon
decline
as
a
satisfactory
occupation
it
is
not
more
sensible
for
everyone
to
flock
to
the
manufacturing
towns
if
the
farms
be
deserted
of
what
use
are
manufacturers
a
reciprocity
can
exist
between
farming
and
manufacturing
the
manufacturer
can
give
the
farmer
what
he
needs
to
be
a
good
farmer
and
the
farmer
and
other
producers
of
raw
materials
can
give
the
manufacturer
what
he
needs
to
be
a
good
manufacturer
then
with
transportation
as
a
messenger
we
shall
have
a
stable
and
a
sound
system
built
on
service
if
we
live
in
smaller
communities
where
the
tension
of
living
is
not
so
high
and
where
the
products
of
the
fields
and
gardens
can
be
had
without
the
interference
of
so
many
profiteers
there
will
be
little
poverty
or
unrest
look
at
this
whole
matter
of
seasonal
work
take
building
as
an
example
of
a
seasonal
trade
what
a
waste
of
power
it
is
to
allow
builders
to
hibernate
through
the
winter
waiting
for
the
building
season
to
come
around
and
what
an
equal
waste
of
skill
it
is
to
force
experienced
artisans
who
have
gone
into
factories
to
escape
the
loss
of
the
winter
season
to
stay
in
the
factory
jobs
through
the
building
season
because
they
are
afraid
they
may
not
get
their
factory
places
back
in
the
winter
what
a
waste
this
system
has
been
if
the
farmer
could
get
away
from
the
shop
to
till
his
farm
in
the
planting
growing
and
harvesting
seasons
they
are
only
a
small
part
of
the
year
after
all
and
if
the
builder
could
get
away
from
the
shop
to
ply
his
useful
trade
in
its
season
how
much
better
they
would
be
and
how
much
more
smoothly
the
world
would
proceed
suppose
we
all
moved
outdoors
every
spring
and
summer
and
lived
the
wholesome
life
of
the
outdoors
for
three
or
four
months
we
could
not
have
slack
times
the
farm
has
its
dull
season
that
is
the
time
for
the
farmer
to
come
into
the
factory
and
help
produce
the
things
he
needs
to
till
the
farm
the
factory
also
has
its
dull
season
that
is
the
time
for
the
workmen
to
go
out
to
the
land
to
help
produce
food
thus
we
might
take
the
slack
out
of
work
and
restore
the
balance
between
the
artificial
and
the
natural
but
not
the
least
benefit
would
be
the
more
balanced
view
of
life
we
should
thus
obtain
the
mixing
of
the
arts
is
not
only
beneficial
in
a
material
way
but
it
makes
for
breadth
of
mind
and
fairness
of
judgment
a
great
deal
of
our
unrest
is
the
result
of
narrow
prejudiced
judgment
if
our
work
were
more
diversified
if
we
saw
more
sides
of
life
if
we
saw
how
necessary
was
one
factor
to
another
we
should
be
more
balanced
every
man
is
better
for
a
period
of
work
under
the
open
sky
it
is
not
at
all
impossible
what
is
desirable
and
right
is
never
impossible
it
would
only
mean
a
little
teamwork
a
little
less
attention
to
greedy
ambition
and
a
little
more
attention
to
life
those
who
are
rich
find
it
desirable
to
go
away
for
three
or
four
months
a
year
and
dawdle
in
idleness
around
some
fancy
winter
or
summer
resort
the
rank
and
file
of
the
american
people
would
not
waste
their
time
that
way
even
if
they
could
but
they
would
provide
the
necessary
for
an
outdoor
seasonal
employment
it
is
hardly
possible
to
doubt
that
much
of
the
unrest
we
see
about
us
is
the
result
of
unnatural
modes
of
life
men
who
do
the
same
thing
continuously
the
year
around
and
are
shut
away
from
the
health
of
the
sun
and
the
spaciousness
of
the
great
out
of
doors
are
hardly
to
be
blamed
if
they
see
matters
in
a
distorted
light
and
that
applies
equally
to
the
capitalist
and
the
worker
what
is
there
in
life
that
should
hamper
normal
and
wholesome
modes
of
living
and
what
is
there
in
industry
incompatible
with
all
the
arts
receiving
in
their
turn
the
attention
of
those
qualified
to
serve
in
them
it
may
be
objected
that
if
the
forces
of
industry
were
withdrawn
from
the
shops
every
summer
it
would
impede
production
but
we
must
look
at
the
matter
from
a
universal
point
of
view
we
must
consider
the
increased
energy
of
the
industrial
forces
after
three
or
four
months
in
outdoor
work
we
must
also
consider
the
effect
on
the
cost
of
living
which
would
result
from
a
general
return
to
the
fields
we
have
as
i
indicated
in
a
previous
chapter
been
working
toward
this
combination
of
farm
and
factory
and
with
entirely
satisfactory
results
at
northville
not
far
from
detroit
we
have
a
little
factory
making
valves
it
is
a
little
factory
but
it
makes
a
great
many
valves
both
the
management
and
the
mechanism
of
the
plant
are
comparatively
simple
because
it
makes
but
one
thing
we
do
not
have
to
search
for
skilled
employees
the
skill
is
in
the
machine
the
people
of
the
countryside
can
work
in
the
plant
part
of
the
time
and
on
the
farm
part
of
the
time
for
mechanical
farming
is
not
very
laborious
the
plant
power
is
derived
from
water
another
plant
on
a
somewhat
larger
scale
is
in
building
at
flat
rock
about
fifteen
miles
from
detroit
we
have
dammed
the
river
the
dam
also
serves
as
a
bridge
for
the
detroit
toledo
ironton
railway
which
was
in
need
of
a
new
bridge
at
that
point
and
a
road
for
the
public
all
in
one
construction
we
are
going
to
make
our
glass
at
this
point
the
damming
of
the
river
gives
sufficient
water
for
the
floating
to
us
of
most
of
our
raw
material
it
also
gives
us
our
power
through
a
hydroelectric
plant
and
being
well
out
in
the
midst
of
the
farming
country
there
can
be
no
possibility
of
crowding
or
any
of
the
ills
incident
to
too
great
a
concentration
of
population
the
men
will
have
plots
of
ground
or
farms
as
well
as
their
jobs
in
the
factory
and
these
can
be
scattered
over
fifteen
or
twenty
miles
surrounding
for
of
course
nowadays
the
workingman
can
come
to
the
shop
in
an
automobile
there
we
shall
have
the
combination
of
agriculture
and
industrialism
and
the
entire
absence
of
all
the
evils
of
concentration
the
belief
that
an
industrial
country
has
to
concentrate
its
industries
is
not
in
my
opinion
that
is
only
a
stage
in
industrial
development
as
we
learn
more
about
manufacturing
and
learn
to
make
articles
with
interchangeable
parts
then
those
parts
can
be
made
under
the
best
possible
conditions
and
these
best
possible
conditions
as
far
as
the
employees
are
concerned
are
also
the
best
possible
conditions
from
the
manufacturing
standpoint
one
could
not
put
a
great
plant
on
a
little
stream
one
can
put
a
small
plant
on
a
little
stream
and
the
combination
of
little
plants
each
making
a
single
part
will
make
the
whole
cheaper
than
a
vast
factory
would
there
are
exceptions
as
where
casting
has
to
be
done
in
such
case
as
at
river
rouge
we
want
to
combine
the
making
of
the
metal
and
the
casting
of
it
and
also
we
want
to
use
all
of
the
waste
power
this
requires
a
large
investment
and
a
considerable
force
of
men
in
one
place
but
such
combinations
are
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule
and
there
would
not
be
enough
of
them
seriously
to
interfere
with
the
process
of
breaking
down
the
concentration
of
industry
industry
will
decentralize
there
is
no
city
that
would
be
rebuilt
as
it
is
were
it
destroyed
which
fact
is
in
itself
a
confession
of
our
real
estimate
of
our
cities
the
city
had
a
place
to
fill
a
work
to
do
doubtless
the
country
places
would
not
have
approximated
their
livableness
had
it
not
been
for
the
cities
by
crowding
together
men
have
learned
some
secrets
they
would
never
have
learned
them
alone
in
the
country
sanitation
lighting
social
organization
all
these
are
products
of
men
experience
in
the
city
but
also
every
social
ailment
from
which
we
suffer
originated
and
centres
in
the
big
cities
you
will
find
the
smaller
communities
living
along
in
unison
with
the
seasons
having
neither
extreme
poverty
nor
wealth
none
of
the
violent
plagues
of
upheave
and
unrest
which
afflict
our
great
populations
there
is
something
about
a
city
of
a
million
people
which
is
untamed
and
threatening
thirty
miles
away
happy
and
contented
villages
read
of
the
ravings
of
the
city
a
great
city
is
really
a
helpless
mass
everything
it
uses
is
carried
to
it
stop
transport
and
the
city
stops
it
lives
off
the
shelves
of
stores
the
shelves
produce
nothing
the
city
can
not
feed
clothe
warm
or
house
itself
city
conditions
of
work
and
living
are
so
artificial
that
instincts
sometimes
rebel
against
their
unnaturalness
and
finally
the
overhead
expense
of
living
or
doing
business
in
the
great
cities
is
becoming
so
large
as
to
be
unbearable
it
places
so
great
a
tax
upon
life
that
there
is
no
surplus
over
to
live
on
the
politicians
have
found
it
easy
to
borrow
money
and
they
have
borrowed
to
the
limit
within
the
last
decade
the
expense
of
running
every
city
in
the
country
has
tremendously
increased
a
good
part
of
that
expense
is
for
interest
upon
money
borrowed
the
money
has
gone
either
into
brick
stone
and
mortar
or
into
necessities
of
city
life
such
as
water
supplies
and
sewage
systems
at
far
above
a
reasonable
cost
the
cost
of
maintaining
these
works
the
cost
of
keeping
in
order
great
masses
of
people
and
traffic
is
greater
than
the
advantages
derived
from
community
life
the
modern
city
has
been
prodigal
it
is
bankrupt
and
it
will
cease
to
be
the
provision
of
a
great
amount
of
cheap
and
convenient
power
not
all
at
once
but
as
it
may
be
used
will
do
more
than
anything
else
to
bring
about
the
balancing
of
life
and
the
cutting
of
the
waste
which
breeds
poverty
there
is
no
single
source
of
power
it
may
be
that
generating
electricity
by
a
steam
plant
at
the
mine
mouth
will
be
the
most
economical
method
for
one
community
power
may
be
best
for
another
community
but
certainly
in
every
community
there
ought
to
be
a
central
station
to
furnish
cheap
power
it
ought
to
be
held
as
essential
as
a
railway
or
a
water
supply
and
we
could
have
every
great
source
of
power
harnessed
and
working
for
the
common
good
were
it
not
that
the
expense
of
obtaining
capital
stands
in
the
way
i
think
that
we
shall
have
to
revise
some
of
our
notions
about
capital
capital
that
a
business
makes
for
itself
that
is
employed
to
expand
the
workman
opportunity
and
increase
his
comfort
and
prosperity
and
that
is
used
to
give
more
and
more
men
work
at
the
same
time
reducing
the
cost
of
service
to
the
public
that
sort
of
capital
even
though
it
be
under
single
control
is
not
a
menace
to
humanity
it
is
a
working
surplus
held
in
trust
and
daily
use
for
the
benefit
of
all
the
holder
of
such
capital
can
scarcely
regard
it
as
a
personal
reward
no
man
can
view
such
a
surplus
as
his
own
for
he
did
not
create
it
alone
it
is
the
joint
product
of
his
whole
organization
the
owner
idea
may
have
released
all
the
energy
and
direction
but
certainly
it
did
not
supply
all
the
energy
and
direction
every
workman
was
a
partner
in
the
creation
no
business
can
possibly
be
considered
only
with
reference
to
and
to
the
individuals
engaged
in
it
it
must
have
the
means
to
carry
on
the
best
wages
ought
to
be
paid
a
proper
living
ought
to
be
assured
every
participant
in
the
business
no
matter
what
his
part
but
for
the
sake
of
that
business
ability
to
support
those
who
work
in
it
a
surplus
has
to
be
held
somewhere
the
truly
honest
manufacturer
holds
his
surplus
profits
in
that
trust
ultimately
it
does
not
matter
where
this
surplus
be
held
nor
who
controls
it
it
is
its
use
that
matters
capital
that
is
not
constantly
creating
more
and
better
jobs
is
more
useless
than
sand
capital
that
is
not
constantly
making
conditions
of
daily
labour
better
and
the
reward
of
daily
labour
more
just
is
not
fulfilling
its
highest
function
the
highest
use
of
capital
is
not
to
make
more
money
but
to
make
money
do
more
service
for
the
betterment
of
life
unless
we
in
our
industries
are
helping
to
solve
the

chapter
xiv
the
tractor
and
power
farming
it
is
not
generally
known
that
our
tractor
which
we
call
the
fordson
was
put
into
production
about
a
year
before
we
had
intended
because
of
the
allies
food
emergency
and
that
all
of
our
early
production
aside
of
course
from
the
trial
and
experimental
machines
went
directly
to
england
we
sent
in
all
five
thousand
tractors
across
the
sea
in
the
critical
period
when
the
submarines
were
busiest
every
one
of
them
arrived
safely
and
officers
of
the
british
government
have
been
good
enough
to
say
that
without
their
aid
england
could
scarcely
have
met
its
food
crisis
it
was
these
tractors
run
mostly
by
women
that
ploughed
up
the
old
estates
and
golf
courses
and
let
all
england
be
planted
and
cultivated
without
taking
away
from
the
fighting
man
power
or
crippling
the
forces
in
the
munitions
factories
it
came
about
in
this
way
the
english
food
administration
about
the
time
that
we
entered
the
war
in
saw
that
with
the
german
submarines
torpedoing
a
freighter
almost
every
day
the
already
low
supply
of
shipping
was
going
to
be
totally
inadequate
to
carry
the
american
troops
across
the
seas
to
carry
the
essential
munitions
for
these
troops
and
the
allies
to
carry
the
food
for
the
fighting
forces
and
at
the
same
time
carry
enough
food
for
the
home
population
of
england
it
was
then
that
they
began
shipping
out
of
england
the
wives
and
families
of
the
colonials
and
made
plans
for
the
growing
of
crops
at
home
the
situation
was
a
grave
one
there
were
not
enough
draft
animals
in
all
england
to
plough
and
cultivate
land
to
raise
crops
in
sufficient
volume
to
make
even
a
dent
in
the
food
imports
power
farming
was
scarcely
known
for
the
english
farms
were
not
before
the
war
big
enough
to
warrant
the
purchase
of
heavy
expensive
farm
machinery
and
especially
with
agricultural
labour
so
cheap
and
plentiful
various
concerns
in
england
made
tractors
but
they
were
heavy
affairs
and
mostly
run
by
steam
there
were
not
enough
of
them
to
go
around
more
could
not
easily
be
made
for
all
the
factories
were
working
on
munitions
and
even
if
they
had
been
made
they
were
too
big
and
clumsy
for
the
average
field
and
in
addition
required
the
management
of
engineers
we
had
put
together
several
tractors
at
our
manchester
plant
for
demonstration
purposes
they
had
been
made
in
the
united
states
and
merely
assembled
in
england
the
board
of
agriculture
requested
the
royal
agricultural
society
to
make
a
test
of
these
tractors
and
report
this
is
what
they
reported
at
the
request
of
the
royal
agricultural
society
of
england
we
have
examined
two
ford
tractors
rated
at
at
work
ploughing
first
a
fallow
of
strong
land
in
a
dirty
condition
and
subsequently
in
a
field
of
lighter
land
which
had
seeded
itself
down
into
rough
grass
and
which
afforded
every
opportunity
of
testing
the
motor
on
the
level
and
on
a
steep
hill
in
the
first
trial
a
oliver
plough
was
used
ploughing
on
an
average
inches
deep
with
a
wide
furrow
a
cockshutt
plough
was
also
used
at
the
same
depth
with
the
breast
pitched
inches
in
the
second
trial
the
plough
was
used
ploughing
an
average
of
inches
deep
in
both
cases
the
motor
did
its
work
with
ease
and
on
a
measured
acre
the
time
occupied
was
hour
minutes
with
a
consumption
of
gallons
of
paraffin
per
acre
these
results
we
consider
very
satisfactory
the
ploughs
were
not
quite
suitable
to
the
land
and
the
tractors
consequently
were
working
at
some
disadvantage
the
total
weight
of
the
tractor
fully
loaded
with
fuel
and
water
as
weighed
by
us
was
cwts
the
tractor
is
light
for
its
power
and
consequently
light
on
the
land
is
easily
handled
turns
in
a
small
circle
and
leaves
a
very
narrow
headland
the
motor
is
quickly
started
up
from
cold
on
a
small
supply
of
petrol
after
these
trials
we
proceeded
to
ford
works
at
trafford
park
manchester
where
one
of
the
motors
had
been
sent
to
be
dismantled
and
inspected
in
detail
we
find
the
design
of
ample
strength
and
the
work
of
quality
we
consider
the
rather
light
and
we
understand
that
a
new
and
stronger
pattern
is
to
be
supplied
in
future
the
tractor
is
designed
purely
for
working
on
the
land
and
the
wheels
which
are
fitted
with
spuds
should
be
provided
with
some
protection
to
enable
them
to
travel
on
the
road
when
moving
from
farm
to
farm
bearing
the
above
points
in
mind
we
recommend
under
existing
circumstances
that
steps
be
taken
to
construct
immediately
as
many
of
these
tractors
as
possible

necessary
steel

factory
under

however
cork

production
could
not

before
next
spring
the
need
for

production
in

is
imperative
and
large
quantity
of
tractors
must
be
available
at
earliest
possible
date
for

breaking
up

and
ploughing
for

wheat
am
requested
by
high
authorities
to
appeal
to
ford
for
help
would
you
be
willing
to
send
sorensen
and
others
with
drawings
of
everything
necessary
loaning
them
to
british
government
so
that
parts
can
be
manufactured
over
here
and
assembled
in
government
factories
under
sorensen
guidance
can
assure
you
positively
this
suggestion
is
made
in
national
interest
and
if
carried
out
will
be
done
by
the
government
for
the
people
with
no
manufacturing
or
capitalist
interest
invested
and
no
profit
being
made
by
any
interests
whatever
the
matter
is
very
urgent
impossible
to
ship
anything
adequate
from
america
because
many
thousand
tractors
must
be
provided
ford
tractor
considered
best
and
only
suitable
design
consequently
national
necessity
entirely
dependent
ford
design
my
work
prevents
me
coming
america
to
present
the
proposal
personally
urge
favorable
consideration
and
immediate
decision
because
every
day
is
of
vital
importance
you
may
rely
on
manufacturing
facility
for
production
here
under
strictest
impartial
government
control
would
welcome
sorensen
and
any
and
every
other
assistance
and
guidance
you
can
furnish

prodome
i
understand
that
its
sending
was
directed
by
the
british
cabinet
we
at
once
cabled
our
entire
willingness
to
lend
the
drawings
the
benefit
of
what
experience
we
had
to
date
and
whatever
men
might
be
necessary
to
get
production
under
way
and
on
the
next
ship
sent
charles
sorensen
with
full
drawings
sorensen
had
opened
the
manchester
plant
and
was
familiar
with
english
conditions
he
was
in
charge
of
the
manufacture
of
tractors
in
this
country
sorensen
started
at
work
with
the
british
officials
to
the
end
of
having
the
parts
made
and
assembled
in
england
many
of
the
materials
which
we
used
were
special
and
could
not
be
obtained
in
england
all
of
their
factories
equipped
for
doing
casting
and
machine
work
were
filled
with
munition
orders
it
proved
to
be
exceedingly
difficult
for
the
ministry
to
get
tenders
of
any
kind
then
came
june
and
a
series
of
destructive
air
raids
on
london
there
was
a
crisis
something
had
to
be
done
and
finally
after
passing
to
and
fro
among
half
the
factories
of
england
our
men
succeeded
in
getting
the
tenders
lodged
with
the
ministry
lord
milner
exhibited
these
tenders
to
sorensen
taking
the
best
of
them
the
price
per
tractor
came
to
about
without
any
guarantee
of
delivery
that
price
is
out
of
all
reason
said
sorensen
these
should
not
cost
more
than
apiece
can
you
make
five
thousand
at
that
price
asked
lord
milner
yes
answered
sorensen
how
long
will
it
take
you
to
deliver
them
we
will
start
shipping
within
sixty
days
they
signed
a
contract
on
the
spot
which
among
other
things
provided
for
an
advance
payment
of
per
cent
of
the
total
sum
sorensen
cabled
us
what
he
had
done
and
took
the
next
boat
home
the
five
per
cent
payment
was
by
the
way
not
touched
by
us
until
after
the
entire
contract
was
completed
we
deposited
it
in
a
kind
of
trust
fund
the
tractor
works
was
not
ready
to
go
into
production
the
highland
park
plant
might
have
been
adapted
but
every
machine
in
it
was
going
day
and
night
on
essential
war
work
there
was
only
one
thing
to
do
we
ran
up
an
emergency
extension
to
our
plant
at
dearborn
equipped
it
with
machinery
that
was
ordered
by
telegraph
and
mostly
came
by
express
and
in
less
than
sixty
days
the
first
tractors
were
on
the
docks
in
new
york
in
the
hands
of
the
british
authorities
they
delayed
in
getting
cargo
space
but
on
december
we
received
this
cable
london
december
sorensen
fordson
dearborn
first
tractors
arrived
when
will
smith
and
others
leave
cable
perry
the
entire
shipment
of
five
thousand
tractors
went
through
within
three
months
and
that
is
why
the
tractors
were
being
used
in
england
long
before
they
were
really
known
in
the
united
states
the
planning
of
the
tractor
really
antedated
that
of
the
motor
car
out
on
the
farm
my
first
experiments
were
with
tractors
and
it
will
be
remembered
that
i
was
employed
for
some
time
by
a
manufacturer
of
steam
tractors
the
big
heavy
road
and
thresher
engines
but
i
did
not
see
any
future
for
the
large
tractors
they
were
too
expensive
for
the
small
farm
required
too
much
skill
to
operate
and
were
much
too
heavy
as
compared
with
the
pull
they
exerted
and
anyway
the
public
was
more
interested
in
being
carried
than
in
being
pulled
the
horseless
carriage
made
a
greater
appeal
to
the
imagination
and
so
it
was
that
i
practically
dropped
work
upon
a
tractor
until
the
automobile
was
in
production
with
the
automobile
on
the
farms
the
tractor
became
a
necessity
for
then
the
farmers
had
been
introduced
to
power
the
farmer
does
not
stand
so
much
in
need
of
new
tools
as
of
power
to
run
the
tools
that
he
has
i
have
followed
many
a
weary
mile
behind
a
plough
and
i
know
all
the
drudgery
of
it
what
a
waste
it
is
for
a
human
being
to
spend
hours
and
days
behind
a
slowly
moving
team
of
horses
when
in
the
same
time
a
tractor
could
do
six
times
as
much
work
it
is
no
wonder
that
doing
everything
slowly
and
by
hand
the
average
farmer
has
not
been
able
to
earn
more
than
a
bare
living
while
farm
products
are
never
as
plentiful
and
cheap
as
they
ought
to
be
as
in
the
automobile
we
wanted
power
not
weight
the
weight
idea
was
firmly
fixed
in
the
minds
of
tractor
makers
it
was
thought
that
excess
weight
meant
excess
pulling
power
that
the
machine
could
not
grip
unless
it
were
heavy
and
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
a
cat
has
not
much
weight
and
is
a
pretty
good
climber
i
have
already
set
out
my
ideas
on
weight
the
only
kind
of
tractor
that
i
thought
worth
working
on
was
one
that
would
be
light
strong
and
so
simple
that
any
one
could
run
it
also
it
had
to
be
so
cheap
that
any
one
could
buy
it
with
these
ends
in
view
we
worked
for
nearly
fifteen
years
on
a
design
and
spent
some
millions
of
dollars
in
experiments
we
followed
exactly
the
same
course
as
with
the
automobile
each
part
had
to
be
as
strong
as
it
was
possible
to
make
it
the
parts
had
to
be
few
in
number
and
the
whole
had
to
admit
of
quantity
production
we
had
some
thought
that
perhaps
the
automobile
engine
might
be
used
and
we
conducted
a
few
experiments
with
it
but
finally
we
became
convinced
that
the
kind
of
tractor
we
wanted
and
the
automobile
had
practically
nothing
in
common
it
was
the
intention
from
the
beginning
that
the
tractor
should
be
made
as
a
separate
undertaking
from
the
automobile
and
in
a
distinct
plant
no
plant
is
big
enough
to
make
two
articles
the
automobile
is
designed
to
carry
the
tractor
is
designed
to
pull
to
climb
and
that
difference
in
function
made
all
the
difference
in
the
world
in
construction
the
hard
problem
was
to
get
bearings
that
would
stand
up
against
the
heavy
pull
we
finally
got
them
and
a
construction
which
seems
to
give
the
best
average
performance
under
all
conditions
we
fixed
upon
a
engine
that
is
started
by
gasoline
but
runs
thereafter
on
kerosene
the
lightest
weight
that
we
could
attain
with
strength
was
pounds
the
grip
is
in
the
lugs
on
the
driving
wheels
as
in
the
claws
of
the
cat
in
addition
to
its
strictly
pulling
functions
the
tractor
to
be
of
the
greatest
service
had
also
to
be
designed
for
work
as
a
stationary
engine
so
that
when
it
was
not
out
on
the
road
or
in
the
fields
it
might
be
hitched
up
with
a
belt
to
run
machinery
in
short
it
had
to
be
a
compact
versatile
power
plant
and
that
it
has
been
it
has
not
only
ploughed
harrowed
cultivated
and
reaped
but
it
has
also
threshed
run
grist
mills
saw
mills
and
various
other
sorts
of
mills
pulled
stumps
ploughed
snow
and
done
about
everything
that
a
plant
of
moderate
power
could
do
from
to
printing
a
newspaper
it
has
been
fitted
with
heavy
tires
to
haul
on
roads
with
sledge
runners
for
the
woods
and
ice
and
with
rimmed
wheels
to
run
on
rails
when
the
shops
in
detroit
were
shut
down
by
coal
shortage
we
got
out
the
by
sending
a
tractor
to
the
factory
stationing
the
tractor
in
the
alley
sending
up
a
belt
four
stories
and
making
the
plates
by
tractor
power
its
use
in
distinct
lines
of
service
has
been
called
to
our
attention
and
probably
we
know
only
a
fraction
of
the
uses
the
mechanism
of
the
tractor
is
even
more
simple
than
that
of
the
automobile
and
it
is
manufactured
in
exactly
the
same
fashion
until
the
present
year
the
production
has
been
held
back
by
the
lack
of
a
suitable
factory
the
first
tractors
had
been
made
in
the
plant
at
dearborn
which
is
now
used
as
an
experimental
station
that
was
not
large
enough
to
affect
the
economies
of
production
and
it
could
not
well
be
enlarged
because
the
design
was
to
make
the
tractors
at
the
river
rouge
plant
and
that
until
this
year
was
not
in
full
operation
now
that
plant
is
completed
for
the
making
of
tractors
the
work
flows
exactly
as
with
the
automobiles
each
part
is
a
separate
departmental
undertaking
and
each
part
as
it
is
finished
joins
the
conveyor
system
which
leads
it
to
its
proper
initial
assembly
and
eventually
into
the
final
assembly
everything
moves
and
there
is
no
skilled
work
the
capacity
of
the
present
plant
is
one
million
tractors
a
year
that
is
the
number
we
expect
to
make
for
the
world
needs
inexpensive
power
plants
more
now
than
ever
before
and
also
it
now
knows
enough
about
machinery
to
want
such
plants
the
first
tractors
as
i
have
said
went
to
england
they
were
first
offered
in
the
united
states
in
at
in
the
next
year
with
the
higher
costs
the
price
had
to
be
made
in
the
middle
of
the
year
it
was
possible
again
to
make
the
introductory
price
of
in
we
charged
in
the
next
year
we
were
sufficiently
familiar
with
the
production
to
begin
cutting
the
price
came
down
to
and
then
in
with
the
river
rouge
plant
functioning
we
were
able
to
cut
to
all
of
which
shows
what
getting
into
scientific
production
will
do
to
a
price
just
as
i
have
no
idea
how
cheaply
the
ford
automobile
can
eventually
be
made
i
have
no
idea
how
cheaply
the
tractor
can
eventually
be
made
it
is
important
that
it
shall
be
cheap
otherwise
power
will
not
go
to
all
the
farms
and
they
must
all
of
them
have
power
within
a
few
years
a
farm
depending
solely
on
horse
and
hand
power
will
be
as
much
of
a
curiosity
as
a
factory
run
by
a
treadmill
the
farmer
must
either
take
up
power
or
go
out
of
business
the
cost
figures
make
this
inevitable
during
the
war
the
government
made
a
test
of
a
fordson
tractor
to
see
how
its
costs
compared
with
doing
the
work
with
horses
the
figures
on
the
tractor
were
taken
at
the
high
price
plus
freight
the
depreciation
and
repair
items
are
not
so
great
as
the
report
sets
them
forth
and
even
if
they
were
the
prices
are
cut
in
halves
which
would
therefore
cut
the
depreciation
and
repair
charge
in
halves
these
are
the
figures

representing

but
this
does
not
take
account
of
the
time
element
the
ploughing
is
done
in
about
one
fourth
the
time
with
only
the
physical
energy
used
to
steer
the
tractor
ploughing
has
become
a
matter
of
motoring
across
a
field
farming
in
the
old
style
is
rapidly
fading
into
a
picturesque
memory
this
does
not
mean
that
work
is
going
to
remove
from
the
farm
work
can
not
be
removed
from
any
life
that
is
productive
but
does
mean
this
drudgery
is
going
to
be
removed
from
the
farm
is
simply
taking
the
burden
from
flesh
and
blood
and
putting
it
on
steel
we
are
in
the
opening
years
of
the
motor
car
wrought
a
revolution
in
modern
farm
life
not
because
it
was
a
vehicle
but
because
it
had
power
farming
ought
to
be
something
more
than
a
rural
occupation
it
ought
to
be
the
business
of
raising
food
and
when
it
does
become
a
business
the
actual
work
of
farming
the
average
sort
of
farm
can
be
done
in
days
a
year
the
other
days
can
be
given
over
to
other
kinds
of
business
farming
is
too
seasonal
an
occupation
to
engage
all
of
a
man
time
as
a
food
business
farming
will
justify
itself
as
a
business
if
it
raises
food
in
sufficient
quantity
and
distributes
it
under
such
conditions
as
will
enable
every
family
to
have
enough
food
for
its
reasonable
needs
there
could
not
be
a
food
trust
if
we
were
to
raise
such
overwhelming
quantities
of
all
kinds
of
food
as
to
make
manipulation
and
exploitation
impossible
the
farmer
who
limits
his
planting
plays
into
the
hands
of
the
speculators
and
then
perhaps
we
shall
witness
a
revival
of
the
small
business
it
was
an
evil
day
when
the
village
flour
mill
disappeared
cooperative
farming
will
become
so
developed
that
we
shall
see
associations
of
farmers
with
their
own
packing
houses
in
which
their
own
hogs
will
be
turned
into
ham
and
bacon
and
with
their
own
flour
mills
in
which
their
grain
will
be
turned
into
commercial
foodstuffs
why
a
steer
raised
in
texas
should
be
brought
to
chicago
and
then
served
in
boston
is
a
question
that
can
not
be
answered
as
long
as
all
the
steers
the
city
needs
could
be
raised
near
boston
the
centralization
of
food
manufacturing
industries
entailing
enormous
costs
for
transportation
and
organization
is
too
wasteful
long
to
continue
in
a
developed
community
we
shall
have
as
great
a
development
in
farming
during
the
next
twenty
years
as
we
have
had
in
manufacturing
during
the
last
twenty
chapter
xv
why
charity
why
should
there
by
any
necessity
for
almsgiving
in
a
civilized
community
it
is
not
the
charitable
mind
to
which
i
object
heaven
forbid
that
we
should
ever
grow
cold
toward
a
fellow
creature
in
need
human
sympathy
is
too
fine
for
the
cool
calculating
attitude
to
take
its
place
one
can
name
very
few
great
advances
that
did
not
have
human
sympathy
behind
them
it
is
in
order
to
help
people
that
every
notable
service
is
undertaken
the
trouble
is
that
we
have
been
using
this
great
fine
motive
force
for
ends
too
small
if
human
sympathy
prompts
us
to
feed
the
hungry
why
should
it
not
give
the
larger
desire
to
make
hunger
in
our
midst
impossible
if
we
have
sympathy
enough
for
people
to
help
them
out
of
their
troubles
surely
we
ought
to
have
sympathy
enough
to
keep
them
out
it
is
easy
to
give
it
is
harder
to
make
giving
unnecessary
to
make
the
giving
unnecessary
we
must
look
beyond
the
individual
to
the
cause
of
his
misery
not
hesitating
of
course
to
relieve
him
in
the
meantime
but
not
stopping
with
mere
temporary
relief
the
difficulty
seems
to
be
in
getting
to
look
beyond
to
the
causes
more
people
can
be
moved
to
help
a
poor
family
than
can
be
moved
to
give
their
minds
toward
the
removal
of
poverty
altogether
i
have
no
patience
with
professional
charity
or
with
any
sort
of
commercialized
humanitarianism
the
moment
human
helpfulness
is
systematized
organized
commercialized
and
professionalized
the
heart
of
it
is
extinguished
and
it
becomes
a
cold
and
clammy
thing
real
human
helpfulness
is
never
or
advertised
there
are
more
orphan
children
being
cared
for
in
the
private
homes
of
people
who
love
them
than
in
the
institutions
there
are
more
old
people
being
sheltered
by
friends
than
you
can
find
in
the
old
people
homes
there
is
more
aid
by
loans
from
family
to
family
than
by
the
loan
societies
that
is
human
society
on
a
humane
basis
looks
out
for
itself
it
is
a
grave
question
how
far
we
ought
to
countenance
the
commercialization
of
the
natural
instinct
of
charity
professional
charity
is
not
only
cold
but
it
hurts
more
than
it
helps
it
degrades
the
recipients
and
drugs
their
akin
to
it
is
sentimental
idealism
the
idea
went
abroad
not
so
many
years
ago
that
service
was
something
that
we
should
expect
to
have
done
for
us
untold
numbers
of
people
became
the
recipients
of
social
service
whole
sections
of
our
population
were
coddled
into
a
state
of
expectant
helplessness
there
grew
up
a
regular
profession
of
doing
things
for
people
which
gave
an
outlet
for
a
laudable
desire
for
service
but
which
contributed
nothing
whatever
to
the
of
the
people
nor
to
the
correction
of
the
conditions
out
of
which
the
supposed
need
for
such
service
grew
worse
than
this
encouragement
of
childish
wistfulness
instead
of
training
for
and
was
the
creation
of
a
feeling
of
resentment
which
nearly
always
overtakes
the
objects
of
charity
people
often
complain
of
the
ingratitude
of
those
whom
they
help
nothing
is
more
natural
in
the
first
place
precious
little
of
our
charity
is
ever
real
charity
offered
out
of
a
heart
full
of
interest
and
sympathy
in
the
second
place
no
person
ever
relishes
being
in
a
position
where
he
is
forced
to
take
favors
such
social
work
creates
a
strained
relation
the
recipient
of
bounty
feels
that
he
has
been
belittled
in
the
taking
and
it
is
a
question
whether
the
giver
should
not
also
feel
that
he
has
been
belittled
in
the
giving
charity
never
led
to
a
settled
state
of
affairs
the
charitable
system
that
does
not
aim
to
make
itself
unnecessary
is
not
performing
service
it
is
simply
making
a
job
for
itself
and
is
an
added
item
to
the
record
of
charity
becomes
unnecessary
as
those
who
seem
to
be
unable
to
earn
livings
are
taken
out
of
the
class
and
put
into
the
productive
in
a
previous
chapter
i
have
set
out
how
experiments
in
our
shops
have
demonstrated
that
in
sufficiently
subdivided
industry
there
are
places
which
can
be
filled
by
the
maimed
the
halt
and
the
blind
scientific
industry
need
not
be
a
monster
devouring
all
who
come
near
it
when
it
is
then
it
is
not
fulfilling
its
place
in
life
in
and
out
of
industry
there
must
be
jobs
that
take
the
full
strength
of
a
powerful
man
there
are
other
jobs
and
plenty
of
them
that
require
more
skill
than
the
artisans
of
the
middle
ages
ever
had
the
minute
subdivision
of
industry
permits
a
strong
man
or
a
skilled
man
always
to
use
his
strength
or
skill
in
the
old
hand
industry
a
skilled
man
spent
a
good
part
of
his
time
at
unskilled
work
that
was
a
waste
but
since
in
those
days
every
task
required
both
skilled
and
unskilled
labour
to
be
performed
by
the
one
man
there
was
little
room
for
either
the
man
who
was
too
stupid
ever
to
be
skilled
or
the
man
who
did
not
have
the
opportunity
to
learn
a
trade
no
mechanic
working
with
only
his
hands
can
earn
more
than
a
bare
sustenance
he
can
not
have
a
surplus
it
has
been
taken
for
granted
that
coming
into
old
age
a
mechanic
must
be
supported
by
his
children
or
if
he
has
no
children
that
he
will
be
a
public
charge
all
of
that
is
quite
unnecessary
the
subdivision
of
industry
opens
places
that
can
be
filled
by
practically
any
one
there
are
more
places
in
subdivision
industry
that
can
be
filled
by
blind
men
than
there
are
blind
men
there
are
more
places
that
can
be
filled
by
cripples
than
there
are
cripples
and
in
each
of
these
places
the
man
who
might
be
considered
as
an
object
of
charity
can
earn
just
as
adequate
a
living
as
the
keenest
and
most
it
is
waste
to
put
an
man
in
a
job
that
might
be
just
as
well
cared
for
by
a
cripple
it
is
a
frightful
waste
to
put
the
blind
at
weaving
baskets
it
is
waste
to
have
convicts
breaking
stone
or
picking
hemp
or
doing
any
sort
of
petty
useless
task
a
jail
should
not
only
be
but
a
man
in
jail
ought
to
be
able
to
support
his
family
or
if
he
has
no
family
he
should
be
able
to
accumulate
a
sum
of
money
sufficient
to
put
him
on
his
feet
when
he
gets
out
of
jail
i
am
not
advocating
convict
labour
or
the
farming
out
of
men
practically
as
slaves
such
a
plan
is
too
detestable
for
words
we
have
greatly
overdone
the
prison
business
anyway
we
begin
at
the
wrong
end
but
as
long
as
we
have
prisons
they
can
be
fitted
into
the
general
scheme
of
production
so
neatly
that
a
prison
may
become
a
productive
unit
working
for
the
relief
of
the
public
and
the
benefit
of
the
prisoners
i
know
that
there
are
laws
foolish
laws
passed
by
unthinking
men
that
restrict
the
industrial
activities
of
prisons
those
laws
were
passed
mostly
at
the
behest
of
what
is
called
labour
they
are
not
for
the
benefit
of
the
workingman
increasing
the
charges
upon
a
community
does
not
benefit
any
one
in
the
community
if
the
idea
of
service
be
kept
in
mind
then
there
is
always
in
every
community
more
work
to
do
than
there
are
men
who
can
do
it
industry
organized
for
service
removes
the
need
for
philanthropy
philanthropy
no
matter
how
noble
its
motive
does
not
make
for
we
must
have
a
community
is
the
better
for
being
discontented
for
being
dissatisfied
with
what
it
has
i
do
not
mean
the
petty
daily
nagging
gnawing
sort
of
discontent
but
a
broad
courageous
sort
of
discontent
which
believes
that
everything
which
is
done
can
and
ought
to
be
eventually
done
better
industry
organized
for
service
and
the
workingman
as
well
as
the
leader
must
serve
can
pay
wages
sufficiently
large
to
permit
every
family
to
be
both
and
a
philanthropy
that
spends
its
time
and
money
in
helping
the
world
to
do
more
for
itself
is
far
better
than
the
sort
which
merely
gives
and
thus
encourages
idleness
philanthropy
like
everything
else
ought
to
be
productive
and
i
believe
that
it
can
be
i
have
personally
been
experimenting
with
a
trade
school
and
a
hospital
to
discover
if
such
institutions
which
are
commonly
regarded
as
benevolent
can
not
be
made
to
stand
on
their
own
feet
i
have
found
that
they
can
be
i
am
not
in
sympathy
with
the
trade
school
as
it
is
commonly
organized
the
boys
get
only
a
smattering
of
knowledge
and
they
do
not
learn
how
to
use
that
knowledge
the
trade
school
should
not
be
a
cross
between
a
technical
college
and
a
school
it
should
be
a
means
of
teaching
boys
to
be
productive
if
they
are
put
at
useless
tasks
at
making
articles
and
then
throwing
them
away
they
can
not
have
the
interest
or
acquire
the
knowledge
which
is
their
right
and
during
the
period
of
schooling
the
boy
is
not
productive
the
schools
unless
by
charity
make
no
provision
for
the
support
of
the
boy
many
boys
need
support
they
must
work
at
the
first
thing
which
comes
to
hand
they
have
no
chance
to
pick
and
choose
when
the
boy
thus
enters
life
untrained
he
but
adds
to
the
already
great
scarcity
of
competent
labour
modern
industry
requires
a
degree
of
ability
and
skill
which
neither
early
quitting
of
school
nor
long
continuance
at
school
provides
it
is
true
that
in
order
to
retain
the
interest
of
the
boy
and
train
him
in
handicraft
manual
training
departments
have
been
introduced
in
the
more
progressive
school
systems
but
even
these
are
confessedly
makeshifts
because
they
only
cater
to
without
satisfying
the
normal
boy
creative
instincts
to
meet
this
condition
to
fulfill
the
boy
educational
possibilities
and
at
the
same
time
begin
his
industrial
training
along
constructive
lines
the
henry
ford
trade
school
was
incorporated
in
we
do
not
use
the
word
philanthropy
in
connection
with
this
effort
it
grew
out
of
a
desire
to
aid
the
boy
whose
circumstances
compelled
him
to
leave
school
early
this
desire
to
aid
fitted
in
conveniently
with
the
necessity
of
providing
trained
in
the
shops
from
the
beginning
we
have
held
to
three
cardinal
principles
first
that
the
boy
was
to
be
kept
a
boy
and
not
changed
into
a
premature
second
that
the
academic
training
was
to
go
hand
in
hand
with
the
industrial
instruction
third
that
the
boy
was
to
be
given
a
sense
of
pride
and
responsibility
in
his
work
by
being
trained
on
articles
which
were
to
be
used
he
works
on
objects
of
recognized
industrial
worth
the
school
is
incorporated
as
a
private
school
and
is
open
to
boys
between
the
ages
of
twelve
and
eighteen
it
is
organized
on
the
basis
of
scholarships
and
each
boy
is
awarded
an
annual
cash
scholarship
of
four
hundred
dollars
at
his
entrance
this
is
gradually
increased
to
a
maximum
of
six
hundred
dollars
if
his
record
is
satisfactory
a
record
of
the
class
and
shop
work
is
kept
and
also
of
the
industry
the
boy
displays
in
each
it
is
the
marks
in
industry
which
are
used
in
making
subsequent
adjustments
of
his
scholarship
in
addition
to
his
scholarship
each
boy
is
given
a
small
amount
each
month
which
must
be
deposited
in
his
savings
account
this
thrift
fund
must
be
left
in
the
bank
as
long
as
the
boy
remains
in
the
school
unless
he
is
given
permission
by
the
authorities
to
use
it
for
an
emergency
one
by
one
the
problems
of
managing
the
school
are
being
solved
and
better
ways
of
accomplishing
its
objects
are
being
discovered
at
the
beginning
it
was
the
custom
to
give
the
boy
one
third
of
the
day
in
class
work
and
two
thirds
in
shop
work
this
daily
adjustment
was
found
to
be
a
hindrance
to
progress
and
now
the
boy
takes
his
training
in
blocks
of
weeks
one
week
in
the
class
and
two
weeks
in
the
shop
classes
are
continuous
the
various
groups
taking
their
weeks
in
turn
the
best
instructors
obtainable
are
on
the
staff
and
the
is
the
ford
plant
it
offers
more
resources
for
practical
education
than
most
universities
the
arithmetic
lessons
come
in
concrete
shop
problems
no
longer
is
the
boy
mind
tortured
with
the
mysterious
a
who
can
row
four
miles
while
b
is
rowing
two
the
actual
processes
and
actual
conditions
are
exhibited
to
him
he
is
taught
to
observe
cities
are
no
longer
black
specks
on
maps
and
continents
are
not
just
pages
of
a
book
the
shop
shipments
to
singapore
the
shop
receipts
of
material
from
africa
and
south
america
are
shown
to
him
and
the
world
becomes
an
inhabited
planet
instead
of
a
coloured
globe
on
the
teacher
desk
in
physics
and
chemistry
the
industrial
plant
provides
a
laboratory
in
which
theory
becomes
practice
and
the
lesson
becomes
actual
experience
suppose
the
action
of
a
pump
is
being
taught
the
teacher
explains
the
parts
and
their
functions
answers
questions
and
then
they
all
troop
away
to
the
engine
rooms
to
see
a
great
pump
the
school
has
a
regular
factory
workshop
with
the
finest
equipment
the
boys
work
up
from
one
machine
to
the
next
they
work
solely
on
parts
or
articles
needed
by
the
company
but
our
needs
are
so
vast
that
this
list
comprehends
nearly
everything
the
inspected
work
is
purchased
by
the
ford
motor
company
and
of
course
the
work
that
does
not
pass
inspection
is
a
loss
to
the
school
the
boys
who
have
progressed
furthest
do
fine
micrometer
work
and
they
do
every
operation
with
a
clear
understanding
of
the
purposes
and
principles
involved
they
repair
their
own
machines
they
learn
how
to
take
care
of
themselves
around
machinery
they
study
and
in
clean
rooms
with
their
instructors
they
lay
the
foundation
for
successful
careers
when
they
graduate
places
are
always
open
for
them
in
the
shops
at
good
wages
the
social
and
moral
of
the
boys
is
given
an
unobtrusive
care
the
supervision
is
not
of
authority
but
of
friendly
interest
the
home
conditions
of
every
boy
are
pretty
well
known
and
his
tendencies
are
observed
and
no
attempt
is
made
to
coddle
him
no
attempt
is
made
to
render
him
one
day
when
two
boys
came
to
the
point
of
a
fight
they
were
not
lectured
on
the
wickedness
of
fighting
they
were
counseled
to
make
up
their
differences
in
a
better
way
but
when
they
preferred
the
more
primitive
mode
of
settlement
they
were
given
gloves
and
made
to
fight
it
out
in
a
corner
of
the
shop
the
only
prohibition
laid
upon
them
was
that
they
were
to
finish
it
there
and
not
to
be
caught
fighting
outside
the
shop
the
result
was
a
short
encounter
and
friendship
they
are
handled
as
boys
their
better
boyish
instincts
are
encouraged
and
when
one
sees
them
in
the
shops
and
classes
one
can
not
easily
miss
the
light
of
dawning
mastery
in
their
eyes
they
have
a
sense
of
belonging
they
feel
they
are
doing
something
worth
while
they
learn
readily
and
eagerly
because
they
are
learning
the
things
which
every
active
boy
wants
to
learn
and
about
which
he
is
constantly
asking
questions
that
none
of
his
can
answer
beginning
with
six
boys
the
school
now
has
two
hundred
and
is
possessed
of
so
practical
a
system
that
it
may
expand
to
seven
hundred
it
began
with
a
deficit
but
as
it
is
one
of
my
basic
ideas
that
anything
worth
while
in
itself
can
be
made
it
has
so
developed
its
processes
that
it
is
now
paying
its
way
we
have
been
able
to
let
the
boy
have
his
boyhood
these
boys
learn
to
be
workmen
but
they
do
not
forget
how
to
be
boys
that
is
of
the
first
importance
they
earn
from
to
cents
an
hour
which
is
more
than
they
could
earn
as
boys
in
the
sort
of
job
open
to
a
youngster
they
can
better
help
support
their
families
by
staying
in
school
than
by
going
out
to
work
when
they
are
through
they
have
a
good
general
education
the
beginning
of
a
technical
education
and
they
are
so
skilled
as
workmen
that
they
can
earn
wages
which
will
give
them
the
liberty
to
continue
their
education
if
they
like
if
they
do
not
want
more
education
they
have
at
least
the
skill
to
command
high
wages
anywhere
they
do
not
have
to
go
into
our
factories
most
of
them
do
because
they
do
not
know
where
better
jobs
are
to
be
had
we
want
all
our
jobs
to
be
good
for
the
men
who
take
them
but
there
is
no
string
tied
to
the
boys
they
have
earned
their
own
way
and
are
under
obligations
to
no
one
there
is
no
charity
the
place
pays
for
itself
the
ford
hospital
is
being
worked
out
on
somewhat
similar
lines
but
because
of
the
interruption
of
the
war
when
it
was
given
to
the
government
and
became
general
hospital
no
housing
some
fifteen
hundred
patients
the
work
has
not
yet
advanced
to
the
point
of
absolutely
definite
results
i
did
not
deliberately
set
out
to
build
this
hospital
it
began
in
as
the
detroit
general
hospital
and
was
designed
to
be
erected
by
popular
subscription
with
others
i
made
a
subscription
and
the
building
began
long
before
the
first
buildings
were
done
the
funds
became
exhausted
and
i
was
asked
to
make
another
subscription
i
refused
because
i
thought
that
the
managers
should
have
known
how
much
the
building
was
going
to
cost
before
they
started
and
that
sort
of
a
beginning
did
not
give
great
confidence
as
to
how
the
place
would
be
managed
after
it
was
finished
however
i
did
offer
to
take
the
whole
hospital
paying
back
all
the
subscriptions
that
had
been
made
this
was
accomplished
and
we
were
going
forward
with
the
work
when
on
august
the
whole
institution
was
turned
over
to
the
government
it
was
returned
to
us
in
october
and
on
the
tenth
day
of
november
of
the
same
year
the
first
private
patient
was
admitted
the
hospital
is
on
west
grand
boulevard
in
detroit
and
the
plot
embraces
twenty
acres
so
that
there
will
be
ample
room
for
expansion
it
is
our
thought
to
extend
the
facilities
as
they
justify
themselves
the
original
design
of
the
hospital
has
been
quite
abandoned
and
we
have
endeavoured
to
work
out
a
new
kind
of
hospital
both
in
design
and
management
there
are
plenty
of
hospitals
for
the
rich
there
are
plenty
of
hospitals
for
the
poor
there
are
no
hospitals
for
those
who
can
afford
to
pay
only
a
moderate
amount
and
yet
desire
to
pay
without
a
feeling
that
they
are
recipients
of
charity
it
has
been
taken
for
granted
that
a
hospital
can
not
both
serve
and
be
that
it
has
to
be
either
an
institution
kept
going
by
private
contributions
or
pass
into
the
class
of
private
sanitariums
managed
for
profit
this
hospital
is
designed
to
be
to
give
a
maximum
of
service
at
a
minimum
of
cost
and
without
the
slightest
colouring
of
charity
in
the
new
buildings
that
we
have
erected
there
are
no
wards
all
of
the
rooms
are
private
and
each
one
is
provided
with
a
bath
the
rooms
which
are
in
groups
of
are
all
identical
in
size
in
fittings
and
in
furnishings
there
is
no
choice
of
rooms
it
is
planned
that
there
shall
be
no
choice
of
anything
within
the
hospital
every
patient
is
on
an
equal
footing
with
every
other
patient
it
is
not
at
all
certain
whether
hospitals
as
they
are
now
managed
exist
for
patients
or
for
doctors
i
am
not
unmindful
of
the
large
amount
of
time
which
a
capable
physician
or
surgeon
gives
to
charity
but
also
i
am
not
convinced
that
the
fees
of
surgeons
should
be
regulated
according
to
the
wealth
of
the
patient
and
i
am
entirely
convinced
that
what
is
known
as
professional
etiquette
is
a
curse
to
mankind
and
to
the
development
of
medicine
diagnosis
is
not
very
much
developed
i
should
not
care
to
be
among
the
proprietors
of
a
hospital
in
which
every
step
had
not
been
taken
to
insure
that
the
patients
were
being
treated
for
what
actually
was
the
matter
with
them
instead
of
for
something
that
one
doctor
had
decided
they
had
professional
etiquette
makes
it
very
difficult
for
a
wrong
diagnosis
to
be
corrected
the
consulting
physician
unless
he
be
a
man
of
great
tact
will
not
change
a
diagnosis
or
a
treatment
unless
the
physician
who
has
called
him
in
is
in
thorough
agreement
and
then
if
a
change
be
made
it
is
usually
without
the
knowledge
of
the
patient
there
seems
to
be
a
notion
that
a
patient
and
especially
when
in
a
hospital
becomes
the
property
of
the
doctor
a
conscientious
practitioner
does
not
exploit
the
patient
a
less
conscientious
one
does
many
physicians
seem
to
regard
the
sustaining
of
their
own
diagnoses
as
of
as
great
moment
as
the
recovery
of
the
patient
it
has
been
an
aim
of
our
hospital
to
cut
away
from
all
of
these
practices
and
to
put
the
interest
of
the
patient
first
therefore
it
is
what
is
known
as
a
closed
hospital
all
of
the
physicians
and
all
of
the
nurses
are
employed
by
the
year
and
they
can
have
no
practice
outside
of
the
hospital
including
the
interns
physicians
and
surgeons
are
on
the
staff
these
men
have
been
selected
with
great
care
and
they
are
paid
salaries
that
amount
to
at
least
as
much
as
they
would
ordinarily
earn
in
successful
private
practice
they
have
none
of
them
any
financial
interest
whatsoever
in
any
patient
and
a
patient
may
not
be
treated
by
a
doctor
from
the
outside
we
gladly
acknowledge
the
place
and
the
use
of
the
family
physician
we
do
not
seek
to
supplant
him
we
take
the
case
where
he
leaves
off
and
return
the
patient
as
quickly
as
possible
our
system
makes
it
undesirable
for
us
to
keep
patients
longer
than
necessary
we
do
not
need
that
kind
of
business
and
we
will
share
with
the
family
physician
our
knowledge
of
the
case
but
while
the
patient
is
in
the
hospital
we
assume
full
responsibility
it
is
closed
to
outside
physicians
practice
though
it
is
not
closed
to
our
cooperation
with
any
family
physician
who
desires
it
the
admission
of
a
patient
is
interesting
the
incoming
patient
is
first
examined
by
the
senior
physician
and
then
is
routed
for
examination
through
three
four
or
whatever
number
of
doctors
seems
necessary
this
routing
takes
place
regardless
of
what
the
patient
came
to
the
hospital
for
because
as
we
are
gradually
learning
it
is
the
complete
health
rather
than
a
single
ailment
which
is
important
each
of
the
doctors
makes
a
complete
examination
and
each
sends
in
his
written
findings
to
the
head
physician
without
any
opportunity
whatsoever
to
consult
with
any
of
the
other
examining
physicians
at
least
three
and
sometimes
six
or
seven
absolutely
complete
and
absolutely
independent
diagnoses
are
thus
in
the
hands
of
the
head
of
the
hospital
they
constitute
a
complete
record
of
the
case
these
precautions
are
taken
in
order
to
insure
within
the
limits
of
knowledge
a
correct
diagnosis
at
the
present
time
there
are
about
six
hundred
beds
available
every
patient
pays
according
to
a
fixed
schedule
that
includes
the
hospital
room
board
medical
and
surgical
attendance
and
nursing
there
are
no
extras
there
are
no
private
nurses
if
a
case
requires
more
attention
than
the
nurses
assigned
to
the
wing
can
give
then
another
nurse
is
put
on
but
without
any
additional
expense
to
the
patient
this
however
is
rarely
necessary
because
the
patients
are
grouped
according
to
the
amount
of
nursing
that
they
will
need
there
may
be
one
nurse
for
two
patients
or
one
nurse
for
five
patients
as
the
type
of
cases
may
require
no
one
nurse
ever
has
more
than
seven
patients
to
care
for
and
because
of
the
arrangements
it
is
easily
possible
for
a
nurse
to
care
for
seven
patients
who
are
not
desperately
ill
in
the
ordinary
hospital
the
nurses
must
make
many
useless
steps
more
of
their
time
is
spent
in
walking
than
in
caring
for
the
patient
this
hospital
is
designed
to
save
steps
each
floor
is
complete
in
itself
and
just
as
in
the
factories
we
have
tried
to
eliminate
the
necessity
for
waste
motion
so
have
we
also
tried
to
eliminate
waste
motion
in
the
hospital
the
charge
to
patients
for
a
room
nursing
and
medical
attendance
is
a
day
this
will
be
lowered
as
the
size
of
the
hospital
increases
the
charge
for
a
major
operation
is
the
charge
for
minor
operations
is
according
to
a
fixed
scale
all
of
the
charges
are
tentative
the
hospital
has
a
cost
system
just
like
a
factory
the
charges
will
be
regulated
to
make
ends
just
meet
there
seems
to
be
no
good
reason
why
the
experiment
should
not
be
successful
its
success
is
purely
a
matter
of
management
and
mathematics
the
same
kind
of
management
which
permits
a
factory
to
give
the
fullest
service
will
permit
a
hospital
to
give
the
fullest
service
and
at
a
price
so
low
as
to
be
within
the
reach
of
everyone
the
only
difference
between
hospital
and
factory
accounting
is
that
i
do
not
expect
the
hospital
to
return
a
profit
we
do
expect
it
to
cover
depreciation
the
investment
in
this
hospital
to
date
is
about
if
we
can
get
away
from
charity
the
funds
that
now
go
into
charitable
enterprises
can
be
turned
to
furthering
production
to
making
goods
cheaply
and
in
great
plenty
and
then
we
shall
not
only
be
removing
the
burden
of
taxes
from
the
community
and
freeing
men
but
also
we
can
be
adding
to
the
general
wealth
we
leave
for
private
interest
too
many
things
we
ought
to
do
for
ourselves
as
a
collective
interest
we
need
more
constructive
thinking
in
public
service
we
need
a
kind
of
universal
training
in
economic
facts
the
ambitions
of
speculative
capital
as
well
as
the
unreasonable
demands
of
irresponsible
labour
are
due
to
ignorance
of
the
economic
basis
of
life
nobody
can
get
more
out
of
life
than
life
can
produce
yet
nearly
everybody
thinks
he
can
speculative
capital
wants
more
labour
wants
more
the
source
of
raw
material
wants
more
and
the
purchasing
public
wants
more
a
family
knows
that
it
can
not
live
beyond
its
income
even
the
children
know
that
but
the
public
never
seems
to
learn
that
it
can
not
live
beyond
its
income
have
more
than
it
produces
in
clearing
out
the
need
for
charity
we
must
keep
in
mind
not
only
the
economic
facts
of
existence
but
also
that
lack
of
knowledge
of
these
facts
encourages
fear
banish
fear
and
we
can
have
charity
is
not
present
where
dwells
fear
is
the
offspring
of
a
reliance
placed
on
something
outside
on
a
foreman
perhaps
on
a
shop
prosperity
on
a
steadiness
that
is
just
another
way
of
saying
that
fear
is
the
portion
of
the
man
who
acknowledges
his
career
to
be
in
the
keeping
of
earthly
circumstances
fear
is
the
result
of
the
body
assuming
ascendancy
over
the
soul
the
habit
of
failure
is
purely
mental
and
is
the
mother
of
fear
this
habit
gets
itself
fixed
on
men
because
they
lack
vision
they
start
out
to
do
something
that
reaches
from
a
to
z
at
a
they
fail
at
b
they
stumble
and
at
c
they
meet
with
what
seems
to
be
an
insuperable
difficulty
they
then
cry
beaten
and
throw
the
whole
task
down
they
have
not
even
given
themselves
a
chance
really
to
fail
they
have
not
given
their
vision
a
chance
to
be
proved
or
disproved
they
have
simply
let
themselves
be
beaten
by
the
natural
difficulties
that
attend
every
kind
of
effort
more
men
are
beaten
than
fail
it
is
not
wisdom
they
need
or
money
or
brilliance
or
pull
but
just
plain
gristle
and
bone
this
rude
simple
primitive
power
which
we
call
is
the
uncrowned
king
of
the
world
of
endeavour
people
are
utterly
wrong
in
their
slant
upon
things
they
see
the
successes
that
men
have
made
and
somehow
they
appear
to
be
easy
but
that
is
a
world
away
from
the
facts
it
is
failure
that
is
easy
success
is
always
hard
a
man
can
fail
in
ease
he
can
succeed
only
by
paying
out
all
that
he
has
and
is
it
is
this
which
makes
success
so
pitiable
a
thing
if
it
be
in
lines
that
are
not
useful
and
uplifting
if
a
man
is
in
constant
fear
of
the
industrial
situation
he
ought
to
change
his
life
so
as
not
to
be
dependent
upon
it
there
is
always
the
land
and
fewer
people
are
on
the
land
now
than
ever
before
if
a
man
lives
in
fear
of
an
employer
favor
changing
toward
him
he
ought
to
extricate
himself
from
dependence
on
any
employer
he
can
become
his
own
boss
it
may
be
that
he
will
be
a
poorer
boss
than
the
one
he
leaves
and
that
his
returns
will
be
much
less
but
at
least
he
will
have
rid
himself
of
the
shadow
of
his
pet
fear
and
that
is
worth
a
great
deal
in
money
and
position
better
still
is
for
the
man
to
come
through
himself
and
exceed
himself
by
getting
rid
of
his
fears
in
the
midst
of
the
circumstances
where
his
daily
lot
is
cast
become
a
freeman
in
the
place
where
you
first
surrendered
your
freedom
win
your
battle
where
you
lost
it
and
you
will
come
to
see
that
although
there
was
much
outside
of
you
that
was
not
right
there
was
more
inside
of
you
that
was
not
right
thus
you
will
learn
that
the
wrong
inside
of
you
spoils
even
the
right
that
is
outside
of
you
a
man
is
still
the
superior
being
of
the
earth
whatever
happens
he
is
still
a
man
business
may
slacken
tomorrow
he
is
still
a
man
he
goes
through
the
changes
of
circumstances
as
he
goes
through
the
variations
of
temperature
still
a
man
if
he
can
only
get
this
thought
reborn
in
him
it
opens
new
wells
and
mines
in
his
own
being
there
is
no
security
outside
of
himself
there
is
no
wealth
outside
of

the
elimination
of
fear
is
the
bringing
in
of
security
and
supply
let
every
american

coddling
americans
ought
to
resent

it

chapter
xvi
the
railroads
nothing
in
this
country
furnishes
a
better
example
of
how
a
business
may
be
turned
from
its
function
of
service
than
do
the
railroads
we
have
a
railroad
problem
and
much
learned
thought
and
discussion
have
been
devoted
to
the
solution
of
that
problem
everyone
is
dissatisfied
with
the
railways
the
public
is
dissatisfied
because
both
the
passenger
and
freight
rates
are
too
high
the
railroad
employees
are
dissatisfied
because
they
say
their
wages
are
too
low
and
their
hours
too
long
the
owners
of
the
railways
are
dissatisfied
because
it
is
claimed
that
no
adequate
return
is
realized
upon
the
money
invested
all
of
the
contacts
of
a
properly
managed
undertaking
ought
to
be
satisfactory
if
the
public
the
employees
and
the
owners
do
not
find
themselves
better
off
because
of
the
undertaking
then
there
must
be
something
very
wrong
indeed
with
the
manner
in
which
the
undertaking
is
carried
through
i
am
entirely
without
any
disposition
to
pose
as
a
railroad
authority
there
may
be
railroad
authorities
but
if
the
service
as
rendered
by
the
american
railroad
is
the
result
of
accumulated
railway
knowledge
then
i
can
not
say
that
my
respect
for
the
usefulness
of
that
knowledge
is
at
all
profound
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
in
the
world
that
the
active
managers
of
the
railways
the
men
who
really
do
the
work
are
entirely
capable
of
conducting
the
railways
of
the
country
to
the
satisfaction
of
every
one
and
i
have
equally
no
doubt
that
these
active
managers
have
by
force
of
a
chain
of
circumstances
all
but
ceased
to
manage
and
right
there
is
the
source
of
most
of
the
trouble
the
men
who
know
railroading
have
not
been
allowed
to
manage
railroads
in
a
previous
chapter
on
finance
were
set
forth
the
dangers
attendant
upon
the
indiscriminate
borrowing
of
money
it
is
inevitable
that
any
one
who
can
borrow
freely
to
cover
errors
of
management
will
borrow
rather
than
correct
the
errors
our
railway
managers
have
been
practically
forced
to
borrow
for
since
the
very
inception
of
the
railways
they
have
not
been
free
agents
the
guiding
hand
of
the
railway
has
been
not
the
railroad
man
but
the
banker
when
railroad
credit
was
high
more
money
was
to
be
made
out
of
floating
bond
issues
and
speculating
in
the
securities
than
out
of
service
to
the
public
a
very
small
fraction
of
the
money
earned
by
the
railways
has
gone
back
into
the
rehabilitation
of
the
properties
when
by
skilled
management
the
net
revenue
became
large
enough
to
pay
a
considerable
dividend
upon
the
stock
then
that
dividend
was
used
first
by
the
speculators
on
the
inside
and
controlling
the
railroad
fiscal
policy
to
boom
the
stock
and
unload
their
holdings
and
then
to
float
a
bond
issue
on
the
strength
of
the
credit
gained
through
the
earnings
when
the
earnings
dropped
or
were
artificially
depressed
then
the
speculators
bought
back
the
stock
and
in
the
course
of
time
staged
another
advance
and
unloading
there
is
scarcely
a
railroad
in
the
united
states
that
has
not
been
through
one
or
more
receiverships
due
to
the
fact
that
the
financial
interests
piled
on
load
after
load
of
securities
until
the
structures
grew
topheavy
and
fell
over
then
they
got
in
on
the
receiverships
made
money
at
the
expense
of
gullible
security
holders
and
started
the
same
old
pyramiding
game
all
over
again
the
natural
ally
of
the
banker
is
the
lawyer
such
games
as
have
been
played
on
the
railroads
have
needed
expert
legal
advice
lawyers
like
bankers
know
absolutely
nothing
about
business
they
imagine
that
a
business
is
properly
conducted
if
it
keeps
within
the
law
or
if
the
law
can
be
altered
or
interpreted
to
suit
the
purpose
in
hand
they
live
on
rules
the
bankers
took
finance
out
of
the
hands
of
the
managers
they
put
in
lawyers
to
see
that
the
railroads
violated
the
law
only
in
legal
fashion
and
thus
grew
up
immense
legal
departments
instead
of
operating
under
the
rules
of
common
sense
and
according
to
circumstances
every
railroad
had
to
operate
on
the
advice
of
counsel
rules
spread
through
every
part
of
the
organization
then
came
the
avalanche
of
state
and
federal
regulations
until
we
find
the
railways
in
a
mass
of
rules
and
regulations
with
the
lawyers
and
the
financiers
on
the
inside
and
various
state
commissions
on
the
outside
the
railway
manager
has
little
chance
that
is
the
trouble
with
the
railways
business
can
not
be
conducted
by
law
we
have
had
the
opportunity
of
demonstrating
to
ourselves
what
a
freedom
from
the
mortmain
means
in
our
experience
with
the
detroit
toledo
ironton
railway
we
bought
the
railway
because
its
right
of
way
interfered
with
some
of
our
improvements
on
the
river
rouge
we
did
not
buy
it
as
an
investment
or
as
an
adjunct
to
our
industries
or
because
of
its
strategic
position
the
extraordinarily
good
situation
of
the
railway
seems
to
have
become
universally
apparent
only
since
we
bought
it
that
however
is
beside
the
point
we
bought
the
railway
because
it
interfered
with
our
plans
then
we
had
to
do
something
with
it
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
run
it
as
a
productive
enterprise
applying
to
it
exactly
the
same
principles
as
are
applied
in
every
department
of
our
industries
we
have
as
yet
made
no
special
efforts
of
any
kind
and
the
railway
has
not
been
set
up
as
a
demonstration
of
how
every
railway
should
be
run
it
is
true
that
applying
the
rule
of
maximum
service
at
minimum
cost
has
caused
the
income
of
the
road
to
exceed
the
outgo
which
for
that
road
represents
a
most
unusual
condition
it
has
been
represented
that
the
changes
we
have
made
and
remember
they
have
been
made
simply
as
part
of
the
work
are
peculiarly
revolutionary
and
quite
without
application
to
railway
management
in
general
personally
it
would
seem
to
me
that
our
little
line
does
not
differ
much
from
the
big
lines
in
our
own
work
we
have
always
found
that
if
our
principles
were
right
the
area
over
which
they
were
applied
did
not
matter
the
principles
that
we
use
in
the
big
highland
park
plant
seem
to
work
equally
well
in
every
plant
that
we
establish
it
has
never
made
any
difference
with
us
whether
we
multiplied
what
we
were
doing
by
five
or
five
hundred
size
is
only
a
matter
of
the
multiplication
table
anyway
the
detroit
toledo
ironton
railway
was
organized
some
years
ago
and
has
been
reorganized
every
few
years
since
then
the
last
reorganization
was
in
the
war
and
the
federal
control
of
the
railways
interrupted
the
cycle
of
reorganization
the
road
owns
miles
of
track
has
miles
of
branches
and
miles
of
trackage
rights
over
other
roads
it
goes
from
detroit
almost
due
south
to
ironton
on
the
ohio
river
thus
tapping
the
west
virginia
coal
deposits
it
crosses
most
of
the
large
trunk
lines
and
it
is
a
road
which
from
a
general
business
standpoint
ought
to
pay
it
has
paid
it
seems
to
have
paid
the
bankers
in
the
net
capitalization
per
mile
of
road
was
in
the
next
receivership
this
was
cut
down
to
per
mile
i
do
not
know
how
much
money
in
all
has
been
raised
on
the
strength
of
the
road
i
do
know
that
in
the
reorganization
of
the
bondholders
were
assessed
and
forced
to
turn
into
the
treasury
nearly
five
million
dollars
which
is
the
amount
that
we
paid
for
the
entire
road
we
paid
sixty
cents
on
the
dollar
for
the
outstanding
mortgage
bonds
although
the
ruling
price
just
before
the
time
of
purchase
was
between
thirty
and
forty
cents
on
the
dollar
we
paid
a
dollar
a
share
for
the
common
stock
and
five
dollars
a
share
for
the
preferred
stock
which
seemed
to
be
a
fair
price
considering
that
no
interest
had
ever
been
paid
upon
the
bonds
and
a
dividend
on
the
stock
was
a
most
remote
possibility
the
rolling
stock
of
the
road
consisted
of
about
seventy
locomotives
passenger
cars
and
around
hundred
freight
cars
all
of
the
rolling
stock
was
in
extremely
bad
condition
and
a
good
part
of
it
would
not
run
at
all
all
of
the
buildings
were
dirty
unpainted
and
generally
run
down
the
roadbed
was
something
more
than
a
streak
of
rust
and
something
less
than
a
railway
the
repair
shops
were
and
practically
everything
connected
with
operation
was
conducted
with
a
maximum
of
waste
there
was
however
an
exceedingly
ample
executive
and
administration
department
and
of
course
a
legal
department
the
legal
department
alone
cost
in
one
month
nearly
we
took
over
the
road
in
march
we
began
to
apply
industrial
principles
there
had
been
an
executive
office
in
detroit
we
closed
that
up
and
put
the
administration
into
the
charge
of
one
man
and
gave
him
half
of
the
desk
out
in
the
freight
office
the
legal
department
went
with
the
executive
offices
there
is
no
reason
for
so
much
litigation
in
connection
with
railroading
our
people
quickly
settled
all
the
mass
of
outstanding
claims
some
of
which
had
been
hanging
on
for
years
as
new
claims
arise
they
are
settled
at
once
and
on
the
facts
so
that
the
legal
expense
seldom
exceeds
a
month
all
of
the
unnecessary
accounting
and
red
tape
were
thrown
out
and
the
payroll
of
the
road
was
reduced
from
to
men
following
our
general
policy
all
titles
and
offices
other
than
those
required
by
law
were
abolished
the
ordinary
railway
organization
is
rigid
a
message
has
to
go
up
through
a
certain
line
of
authority
and
no
man
is
expected
to
do
anything
without
explicit
orders
from
his
superior
one
morning
i
went
out
to
the
road
very
early
and
found
a
wrecking
train
with
steam
up
a
crew
aboard
and
all
ready
to
start
it
had
been
awaiting
orders
for
half
an
hour
we
went
down
and
cleared
the
wreck
before
the
orders
came
through
that
was
before
the
idea
of
personal
responsibility
had
soaked
in
it
was
a
little
hard
to
break
the
orders
habit
the
men
at
first
were
afraid
to
take
responsibility
but
as
we
went
on
they
seemed
to
like
the
plan
more
and
more
and
now
no
man
limits
his
duties
a
man
is
paid
for
a
day
work
of
eight
hours
and
he
is
expected
to
work
during
those
eight
hours
if
he
is
an
engineer
and
finishes
a
run
in
four
hours
then
he
works
at
whatever
else
may
be
in
demand
for
the
next
four
hours
if
a
man
works
more
than
eight
hours
he
is
not
paid
for
overtime
he
deducts
his
overtime
from
the
next
working
day
or
saves
it
up
and
gets
a
whole
day
off
with
pay
our
day
is
a
day
of
eight
hours
and
not
a
basis
for
computing
pay
the
minimum
wage
is
six
dollars
a
day
there
are
no
extra
men
we
have
cut
down
in
the
offices
in
the
shops
and
on
the
roads
in
one
shop
men
are
now
doing
more
work
than
did
before
not
long
ago
one
of
our
track
gangs
consisting
of
a
foreman
and
men
was
working
beside
a
parallel
road
on
which
was
a
gang
of
men
doing
exactly
the
same
sort
of
track
repairing
and
ballasting
in
five
days
our
gang
did
two
telegraph
poles
more
than
the
competing
gang
the
road
is
being
rehabilitated
nearly
the
whole
track
has
been
reballasted
and
many
miles
of
new
rails
have
been
laid
the
locomotives
and
rolling
stock
are
being
overhauled
in
our
own
shops
and
at
a
very
slight
expense
we
found
that
the
supplies
bought
previously
were
of
poor
quality
or
unfitted
for
the
use
we
are
saving
money
on
supplies
by
buying
better
qualities
and
seeing
that
nothing
is
wasted
the
men
seem
entirely
willing
to
cooperate
in
saving
they
do
not
discard
that
which
might
be
used
we
ask
a
man
what
can
you
get
out
of
an
engine
and
he
answers
with
an
economy
record
and
we
are
not
pouring
in
great
amounts
of
money
everything
is
being
done
out
of
earnings
that
is
our
policy
the
trains
must
go
through
and
on
time
the
time
of
freight
movements
has
been
cut
down
about
two
thirds
a
car
on
a
siding
is
not
just
a
car
on
a
siding
it
is
a
great
big
question
mark
someone
has
to
know
why
it
is
there
it
used
to
take
or
days
to
get
freight
through
to
philadelphia
or
new
york
now
it
takes
three
and
a
half
days
the
organization
is
serving
all
sorts
of
explanations
are
put
forward
of
why
a
deficit
was
turned
into
a
surplus
i
am
told
that
it
is
all
due
to
diverting
the
freight
of
the
ford
industries
if
we
had
diverted
all
of
our
business
to
this
road
that
would
not
explain
why
we
manage
at
so
much
lower
an
operating
cost
than
before
we
are
routing
as
much
as
we
can
of
our
own
business
over
the
road
but
only
because
we
there
get
the
best
service
for
years
past
we
had
been
trying
to
send
freight
over
this
road
because
it
was
conveniently
located
but
we
had
never
been
able
to
use
it
to
any
extent
because
of
the
delayed
deliveries
we
could
not
count
on
a
shipment
to
within
five
or
six
weeks
that
tied
up
too
much
money
and
also
broke
into
our
production
schedule
there
was
no
reason
why
the
road
should
not
have
had
a
schedule
but
it
did
not
the
delays
became
legal
matters
to
be
taken
up
in
due
legal
course
that
is
not
the
way
of
business
we
think
that
a
delay
is
a
criticism
of
our
work
and
is
something
at
once
to
be
investigated
that
is
business
the
railroads
in
general
have
broken
down
and
if
the
former
conduct
of
the
detroit
toledo
ironton
is
any
criterion
of
management
in
general
there
is
no
reason
in
the
world
why
they
should
not
have
broken
down
too
many
railroads
are
run
not
from
the
offices
of
practical
men
but
from
banking
offices
and
the
principles
of
procedure
the
whole
outlook
are
financial
not
transportational
but
financial
there
has
been
a
breakdown
simply
because
more
attention
has
been
paid
to
railroads
as
factors
in
the
stock
market
than
as
servants
of
the
people
outworn
ideas
have
been
retained
development
has
been
practically
stopped
and
railroad
men
with
vision
have
not
been
set
free
to
grow
will
a
billion
dollars
solve
that
sort
of
trouble
no
a
billion
dollars
will
only
make
the
difficulty
one
billion
dollars
worse
the
purpose
of
the
billion
is
simply
to
continue
the
present
methods
of
railroad
management
and
it
is
because
of
the
present
methods
that
we
have
any
railroad
difficulties
at
all
the
mistaken
and
foolish
things
we
did
years
ago
are
just
overtaking
us
at
the
beginning
of
railway
transportation
in
the
united
states
the
people
had
to
be
taught
its
use
just
as
they
had
to
be
taught
the
use
of
the
telephone
also
the
new
railroads
had
to
make
business
in
order
to
keep
themselves
solvent
and
because
railway
financing
began
in
one
of
the
rottenest
periods
of
our
business
history
a
number
of
practices
were
established
as
precedents
which
have
influenced
railway
work
ever
since
one
of
the
first
things
the
railways
did
was
to
throttle
all
other
methods
of
transportation
there
was
the
beginning
of
a
splendid
canal
system
in
this
country
and
a
great
movement
for
canalization
was
at
its
height
the
railroad
companies
bought
out
the
canal
companies
and
let
the
canals
fill
up
and
choke
with
weeds
and
refuse
all
over
the
eastern
and
in
parts
of
the
middle
western
states
are
the
remains
of
this
network
of
internal
waterways
they
are
being
restored
now
as
rapidly
as
possible
they
are
being
linked
together
various
commissions
public
and
private
have
seen
the
vision
of
a
complete
system
of
waterways
serving
all
parts
of
the
country
and
thanks
to
their
efforts
persistence
and
faith
progress
is
being
made
but
there
was
another
this
was
the
system
of
making
the
haul
as
long
as
possible
any
one
who
is
familiar
with
the
exposures
which
resulted
in
the
formation
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
knows
what
is
meant
by
this
there
was
a
period
when
rail
transport
was
not
regarded
as
the
servant
of
the
traveling
manufacturing
and
commercial
publics
business
was
treated
as
if
it
existed
for
the
benefit
of
the
railways
during
this
period
of
folly
it
was
not
good
railroading
to
get
goods
from
their
shipping
point
to
their
destination
by
the
most
direct
line
possible
but
to
keep
them
on
the
road
as
long
as
possible
send
them
around
the
longest
way
give
as
many
connecting
lines
as
possible
a
piece
of
the
profit
and
let
the
public
stand
the
resulting
loss
of
time
and
money
that
was
once
counted
good
railroading
it
has
not
entirely
passed
out
of
practice
one
of
the
great
changes
in
our
economic
life
to
which
this
railroad
policy
contributed
was
the
centralization
of
certain
activities
not
because
centralization
was
necessary
nor
because
it
contributed
to
the
of
the
people
but
because
among
other
things
it
made
double
business
for
the
railroads
take
two
staples
meat
and
grain
if
you
look
at
the
maps
which
the
packing
houses
put
out
and
see
where
the
cattle
are
drawn
from
and
then
if
you
consider
that
the
cattle
when
converted
into
food
are
hauled
again
by
the
same
railways
right
back
to
the
place
where
they
came
from
you
will
get
some
sidelight
on
the
transportation
problem
and
the
price
of
meat
take
also
grain
every
reader
of
advertisements
knows
where
the
great
flour
mills
of
the
country
are
located
and
they
probably
know
also
that
these
great
mills
are
not
located
in
the
sections
where
the
grain
of
the
united
states
is
raised
there
are
staggering
quantities
of
grain
thousands
of
trainloads
hauled
uselessly
long
distances
and
then
in
the
form
of
flour
hauled
back
again
long
distances
to
the
states
and
sections
where
the
grain
was
raised
a
burdening
of
the
railroads
which
is
of
no
benefit
to
the
communities
where
the
grain
originated
nor
to
any
one
else
except
the
monopolistic
mills
and
the
railroads
the
railroads
can
always
do
a
big
business
without
helping
the
business
of
the
country
at
all
they
can
always
be
engaged
in
just
such
useless
hauling
on
meat
and
grain
and
perhaps
on
cotton
too
the
transportation
burden
could
be
reduced
by
more
than
half
by
the
preparation
of
the
product
for
use
before
it
is
shipped
if
a
coal
community
mined
coal
in
pennsylvania
and
then
sent
it
by
railway
to
michigan
or
wisconsin
to
be
screened
and
then
hauled
it
back
again
to
pennsylvania
for
use
it
would
not
be
much
sillier
than
the
hauling
of
texas
beef
alive
to
chicago
there
to
be
killed
and
then
shipped
back
dead
to
texas
or
the
hauling
of
kansas
grain
to
minnesota
there
to
be
ground
in
the
mills
and
hauled
back
again
as
flour
it
is
good
business
for
the
railroads
but
it
is
bad
business
for
business
one
angle
of
the
transportation
problem
to
which
too
few
men
are
paying
attention
is
this
useless
hauling
of
material
if
the
problem
were
tackled
from
the
point
of
ridding
the
railroads
of
their
useless
hauls
we
might
discover
that
we
are
in
better
shape
than
we
think
to
take
care
of
the
legitimate
transportation
business
of
the
country
in
commodities
like
coal
it
is
necessary
that
they
be
hauled
from
where
they
are
to
where
they
are
needed
the
same
is
true
of
the
raw
materials
of
industry
they
must
be
hauled
from
the
place
where
nature
has
stored
them
to
the
place
where
there
are
people
ready
to
work
them
and
as
these
raw
materials
are
not
often
found
assembled
in
one
section
a
considerable
amount
of
transportation
to
a
central
assembling
place
is
necessary
the
coal
comes
from
one
section
the
copper
from
another
the
iron
from
another
the
wood
from
another
they
must
all
be
brought
together
but
wherever
it
is
possible
a
policy
of
decentralization
ought
to
be
adopted
we
need
instead
of
mammoth
flour
mills
a
multitude
of
smaller
mills
distributed
through
all
the
sections
where
grain
is
grown
wherever
it
is
possible
the
section
that
produces
the
raw
material
ought
to
produce
also
the
finished
product
grain
should
be
ground
to
flour
where
it
is
grown
a
country
should
not
export
hogs
but
pork
hams
and
bacon
the
cotton
mills
ought
to
be
near
the
cotton
fields
this
is
not
a
revolutionary
idea
in
a
sense
it
is
a
reactionary
one
it
does
not
suggest
anything
new
it
suggests
something
that
is
very
old
this
is
the
way
the
country
did
things
before
we
fell
into
the
habit
of
carting
everything
around
a
few
thousand
miles
and
adding
the
cartage
to
the
consumer
bill
our
communities
ought
to
be
more
complete
in
themselves
they
ought
not
to
be
unnecessarily
dependent
on
railway
transportation
out
of
what
they
produce
they
should
supply
their
own
needs
and
ship
the
surplus
and
how
can
they
do
this
unless
they
have
the
means
of
taking
their
raw
materials
like
grain
and
cattle
and
changing
them
into
finished
products
if
private
enterprise
does
not
yield
these
means
the
cooperation
of
farmers
can
the
chief
injustice
sustained
by
the
farmer
is
that
being
the
greatest
producer
he
is
prevented
from
being
also
the
greatest
merchandiser
because
he
is
compelled
to
sell
to
those
who
put
his
products
into
merchantable
form
if
he
could
change
his
grain
into
flour
his
cattle
into
beef
and
his
hogs
into
hams
and
bacon
not
only
would
he
receive
the
fuller
profit
of
his
product
but
he
would
render
his
communities
more
independent
of
railway
exigencies
and
thereby
improve
the
transportation
system
by
relieving
it
of
the
burden
of
his
unfinished
product
the
thing
is
not
only
reasonable
and
practicable
but
it
is
becoming
absolutely
necessary
more
than
that
it
is
being
done
in
many
places
but
it
will
not
register
its
full
effect
on
the
transportation
situation
and
upon
the
cost
of
living
until
it
is
done
more
widely
and
in
more
kinds
of
materials
it
is
one
of
nature
compensations
to
withdraw
prosperity
from
the
business
which
does
not
serve
we
have
found
that
on
the
detroit
toledo
ironton
we
could
following
our
universal
policy
reduce
our
rates
and
get
more
business
we
made
some
cuts
but
the
interstate
commerce
commission
refused
to
allow
them
under
such
conditions
why
discuss
the
railroads
as
a
business
or
as
a
service
chapter
xvii
things
in
general
no
man
exceeds
thomas
edison
in
broad
vision
and
understanding
i
met
him
first
many
years
ago
when
i
was
with
the
detroit
edison
company
probably
about
or
thereabouts
the
electrical
men
held
a
convention
at
atlantic
city
and
edison
as
the
leader
in
electrical
science
made
an
address
i
was
then
working
on
my
gasoline
engine
and
most
people
including
all
of
my
associates
in
the
electrical
company
had
taken
pains
to
tell
me
that
time
spent
on
a
gasoline
engine
was
time
wasted
that
the
power
of
the
future
was
to
be
electricity
these
criticisms
had
not
made
any
impression
on
me
i
was
working
ahead
with
all
my
might
but
being
in
the
same
room
with
edison
suggested
to
me
that
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
find
out
if
the
master
of
electricity
thought
it
was
going
to
be
the
only
power
in
the
future
so
after
edison
had
finished
his
address
i
managed
to
catch
him
alone
for
a
moment
i
told
him
what
i
was
working
on
at
once
he
was
interested
he
is
interested
in
every
search
for
new
knowledge
and
then
i
asked
him
if
he
thought
that
there
was
a
future
for
the
internal
combustion
engine
he
answered
something
in
this
fashion
yes
there
is
a
big
future
for
any
engine
that
can
develop
a
high
horsepower
and
be
no
one
kind
of
motive
power
is
ever
going
to
do
all
the
work
of
the
country
we
do
not
know
what
electricity
can
do
but
i
take
for
granted
that
it
can
not
do
everything
keep
on
with
your
engine
if
you
can
get
what
you
are
after
i
can
see
a
great
future
that
is
characteristic
of
edison
he
was
the
central
figure
in
the
electrical
industry
which
was
then
young
and
enthusiastic
the
rank
and
file
of
the
electrical
men
could
see
nothing
ahead
but
electricity
but
their
leader
could
see
with
crystal
clearness
that
no
one
power
could
do
all
the
work
of
the
country
i
suppose
that
is
why
he
was
the
leader
such
was
my
first
meeting
with
edison
i
did
not
see
him
again
until
many
years
after
until
our
motor
had
been
developed
and
was
in
production
he
remembered
perfectly
our
first
meeting
since
then
we
have
seen
each
other
often
he
is
one
of
my
closest
friends
and
we
together
have
swapped
many
an
idea
his
knowledge
is
almost
universal
he
is
interested
in
every
conceivable
subject
and
he
recognizes
no
limitations
he
believes
that
all
things
are
possible
at
the
same
time
he
keeps
his
feet
on
the
ground
he
goes
forward
step
by
step
he
regards
impossible
as
a
description
for
that
which
we
have
not
at
the
moment
the
knowledge
to
achieve
he
knows
that
as
we
amass
knowledge
we
build
the
power
to
overcome
the
impossible
that
is
the
rational
way
of
doing
the
impossible
the
irrational
way
is
to
make
the
attempt
without
the
toil
of
accumulating
knowledge
edison
is
only
approaching
the
height
of
his
power
he
is
the
man
who
is
going
to
show
us
what
chemistry
really
can
do
for
he
is
a
real
scientist
who
regards
the
knowledge
for
which
he
is
always
searching
as
a
tool
to
shape
the
progress
of
the
world
he
is
not
the
type
of
scientist
who
merely
stores
up
knowledge
and
turns
his
head
into
a
museum
edison
is
easily
the
world
greatest
scientist
i
am
not
sure
that
he
is
not
also
the
world
worst
business
man
he
knows
almost
nothing
of
business
john
burroughs
was
another
of
those
who
honoured
me
with
their
friendship
i
too
like
birds
i
like
the
outdoors
i
like
to
walk
across
country
and
jump
fences
we
have
five
hundred
bird
houses
on
the
farm
we
call
them
our
bird
hotels
and
one
of
them
the
hotel
pontchartrain
a
martin
house
has
apartments
all
winter
long
we
have
wire
baskets
of
food
hanging
about
on
the
trees
and
then
there
is
a
big
basin
in
which
the
water
is
kept
from
freezing
by
an
electric
heater
summer
and
winter
food
drink
and
shelter
are
on
hand
for
the
birds
we
have
hatched
pheasants
and
quail
in
incubators
and
then
turned
them
over
to
electric
brooders
we
have
all
kinds
of
bird
houses
and
nests
the
sparrows
who
are
great
abusers
of
hospitality
insist
that
their
nests
be
immovable
that
they
do
not
sway
in
the
wind
the
wrens
like
swaying
nests
so
we
mounted
a
number
of
wren
boxes
on
strips
of
spring
steel
so
that
they
would
sway
in
the
wind
the
wrens
liked
the
idea
and
the
sparrows
did
not
so
we
have
been
able
to
have
the
wrens
nest
in
peace
in
summer
we
leave
cherries
on
the
trees
and
strawberries
open
in
the
beds
and
i
think
that
we
have
not
only
more
but
also
more
different
kinds
of
bird
callers
than
anywhere
else
in
the
northern
states
john
burroughs
said
he
thought
we
had
and
one
day
when
he
was
staying
at
our
place
he
came
across
a
bird
that
he
had
never
seen
before
about
ten
years
ago
we
imported
a
great
number
of
birds
from
abroad
chaffinches
green
finches
red
pales
twites
bullfinches
jays
linnets
larks
some
five
hundred
of
them
they
stayed
around
a
while
but
where
they
are
now
i
do
not
know
i
shall
not
import
any
more
birds
are
entitled
to
live
where
they
want
to
live
birds
are
the
best
of
companions
we
need
them
for
their
beauty
and
their
companionship
and
also
we
need
them
for
the
strictly
economic
reason
that
they
destroy
harmful
insects
the
only
time
i
ever
used
the
ford
organization
to
influence
legislation
was
on
behalf
of
the
birds
and
i
think
the
end
justified
the
means
the
bird
bill
providing
for
bird
sanctuaries
for
our
migratory
birds
had
been
hanging
in
congress
with
every
likelihood
of
dying
a
natural
death
its
immediate
sponsors
could
not
arouse
much
interest
among
the
congressmen
birds
do
not
vote
we
got
behind
that
bill
and
we
asked
each
of
our
six
thousand
dealers
to
wire
to
his
representative
in
congress
it
began
to
become
apparent
that
birds
might
have
votes
the
bill
went
through
our
organization
has
never
been
used
for
any
political
purpose
and
never
will
be
we
assume
that
our
people
have
a
right
to
their
own
preferences
to
get
back
to
john
burroughs
of
course
i
knew
who
he
was
and
i
had
read
nearly
everything
he
had
written
but
i
had
never
thought
of
meeting
him
until
some
years
ago
when
he
developed
a
grudge
against
modern
progress
he
detested
money
and
especially
he
detested
the
power
which
money
gives
to
vulgar
people
to
despoil
the
lovely
countryside
he
grew
to
dislike
the
industry
out
of
which
money
is
made
he
disliked
the
noise
of
factories
and
railways
he
criticized
industrial
progress
and
he
declared
that
the
automobile
was
going
to
kill
the
appreciation
of
nature
i
fundamentally
disagreed
with
him
i
thought
that
his
emotions
had
taken
him
on
the
wrong
tack
and
so
i
sent
him
an
automobile
with
the
request
that
he
try
it
out
and
discover
for
himself
whether
it
would
not
help
him
to
know
nature
better
that
automobile
and
it
took
him
some
time
to
learn
how
to
manage
it
himself
completely
changed
his
point
of
view
he
found
that
it
helped
him
to
see
more
and
from
the
time
of
getting
it
he
made
nearly
all
of
his
expeditions
behind
the
steering
wheel
he
learned
that
instead
of
having
to
confine
himself
to
a
few
miles
around
slabsides
the
whole
countryside
was
open
to
him
out
of
that
automobile
grew
our
friendship
and
it
was
a
fine
one
no
man
could
help
being
the
better
for
knowing
john
burroughs
he
was
not
a
professional
naturalist
nor
did
he
make
sentiment
do
for
hard
research
it
is
easy
to
grow
sentimental
out
of
doors
it
is
hard
to
pursue
the
truth
about
a
bird
as
one
would
pursue
a
mechanical
principle
but
john
burroughs
did
that
and
as
a
result
the
observations
he
set
down
were
very
largely
accurate
he
was
impatient
with
men
who
were
not
accurate
in
their
observations
of
natural
life
john
burroughs
first
loved
nature
for
its
own
sake
it
was
not
merely
his
stock
of
material
as
a
professional
writer
he
loved
it
before
he
wrote
about
it
late
in
life
he
turned
philosopher
his
philosophy
was
not
so
much
a
philosophy
of
nature
as
it
was
a
natural
philosophy
the
long
serene
thoughts
of
a
man
who
had
lived
in
the
tranquil
spirit
of
the
trees
he
was
not
pagan
he
was
not
pantheist
but
he
did
not
much
divide
between
nature
and
human
nature
nor
between
human
nature
and
divine
john
burroughs
lived
a
wholesome
life
he
was
fortunate
to
have
as
his
home
the
farm
on
which
he
was
born
through
long
years
his
surroundings
were
those
which
made
for
quietness
of
mind
he
loved
the
woods
and
he
made
city
people
love
them
too
he
helped
them
see
what
he
saw
he
did
not
make
much
beyond
a
living
he
could
have
done
so
perhaps
but
that
was
not
his
aim
like
another
american
naturalist
his
occupation
could
have
been
described
as
inspector
of
birds
nests
and
hillside
paths
of
course
that
does
not
pay
in
dollars
and
cents
when
he
had
passed
the
three
score
and
ten
he
changed
his
views
on
industry
perhaps
i
had
something
to
do
with
that
he
came
to
see
that
the
whole
world
could
not
live
by
hunting
birds
nests
at
one
time
in
his
life
he
had
a
grudge
against
all
modern
progress
especially
where
it
was
associated
with
the
burning
of
coal
and
the
noise
of
traffic
perhaps
that
was
as
near
to
literary
affectation
as
he
ever
came
wordsworth
disliked
railways
too
and
thoreau
said
that
he
could
see
more
of
the
country
by
walking
perhaps
it
was
influences
such
as
these
which
bent
john
burroughs
for
a
time
against
industrial
progress
but
only
for
a
time
he
came
to
see
that
it
was
fortunate
for
him
that
others
tastes
ran
in
other
channels
just
as
it
was
fortunate
for
the
world
that
his
taste
ran
in
its
own
channel
there
has
been
no
observable
development
in
the
method
of
making
birds
nests
since
the
beginning
of
recorded
observation
but
that
was
hardly
a
reason
why
human
beings
should
not
prefer
modern
sanitary
homes
to
cave
dwellings
this
was
a
part
of
john
burroughs
sanity
he
was
not
afraid
to
change
his
views
he
was
a
lover
of
nature
not
her
dupe
in
the
course
of
time
he
came
to
value
and
approve
modern
devices
and
though
this
by
itself
is
an
interesting
fact
it
is
not
so
interesting
as
the
fact
that
he
made
this
change
after
he
was
seventy
years
old
john
burroughs
was
never
too
old
to
change
he
kept
growing
to
the
last
the
man
who
is
too
set
to
change
is
dead
already
the
funeral
is
a
mere
detail
if
he
talked
more
of
one
person
than
another
it
was
emerson
not
only
did
he
know
emerson
by
heart
as
an
author
but
he
knew
him
by
heart
as
a
spirit
he
taught
me
to
know
emerson
he
had
so
saturated
himself
with
emerson
that
at
one
time
he
thought
as
he
did
and
even
fell
into
his
mode
of
expression
but
afterward
he
found
his
own
way
which
for
him
was
better
there
was
no
sadness
in
john
burroughs
death
when
the
grain
lies
brown
and
ripe
under
the
harvest
sun
and
the
harvesters
are
busy
binding
it
into
sheaves
there
is
no
sadness
for
the
grain
it
has
ripened
and
has
fulfilled
its
term
and
so
had
john
burroughs
with
him
it
was
full
ripeness
and
harvest
not
decay
he
worked
almost
to
the
end
his
plans
ran
beyond
the
end
they
buried
him
amid
the
scenes
he
loved
and
it
was
his
birthday
those
scenes
will
be
preserved
as
he
loved
them
john
burroughs
edison
and
i
with
harvey
firestone
made
several
vagabond
trips
together
we
went
in
motor
caravans
and
slept
under
canvas
once
we
gypsied
through
the
adirondacks
and
again
through
the
alleghenies
heading
southward
the
trips
were
good
fun
except
that
they
began
to
attract
too
much
attention
i
am
more
opposed
to
war
than
ever
i
was
and
i
think
the
people
of
the
world
know
even
if
the
politicians
do
not
that
war
never
settles
anything
it
was
war
that
made
the
orderly
and
profitable
processes
of
the
world
what
they
are
a
loose
disjointed
mass
of
course
some
men
get
rich
out
of
war
others
get
poor
but
the
men
who
get
rich
are
not
those
who
fought
or
who
really
helped
behind
the
lines
no
patriot
makes
money
out
of
war
no
man
with
true
patriotism
could
make
money
out
of
war
out
of
the
sacrifice
of
other
men
lives
until
the
soldier
makes
money
by
fighting
until
mothers
make
money
by
giving
their
sons
to
death
not
until
then
should
any
citizen
make
money
out
of
providing
his
country
with
the
means
to
preserve
its
life
if
wars
are
to
continue
it
will
be
harder
and
harder
for
the
upright
business
man
to
regard
war
as
a
legitimate
means
of
high
and
speedy
profits
war
fortunes
are
losing
caste
every
day
even
greed
will
some
day
hesitate
before
the
overwhelming
unpopularity
and
opposition
which
will
meet
the
war
profiteer
business
should
be
on
the
side
of
peace
because
peace
is
business
best
asset
and
by
the
way
was
inventive
genius
ever
so
sterile
as
it
was
during
the
war
an
impartial
investigation
of
the
last
war
of
what
preceded
it
and
what
has
come
out
of
it
would
show
beyond
a
doubt
that
there
is
in
the
world
a
group
of
men
with
vast
powers
of
control
that
prefers
to
remain
unknown
that
does
not
seek
office
or
any
of
the
tokens
of
power
that
belongs
to
no
nation
whatever
but
is
international
a
force
that
uses
every
government
every
widespread
business
organization
every
agency
of
publicity
every
resource
of
national
psychology
to
throw
the
world
into
a
panic
for
the
sake
of
getting
still
more
power
over
the
world
an
old
gambling
trick
used
to
be
for
the
gambler
to
cry
police
when
a
lot
of
money
was
on
the
table
and
in
the
panic
that
followed
to
seize
the
money
and
run
off
with
it
there
is
a
power
within
the
world
which
cries
war
and
in
the
confusion
of
the
nations
the
unrestrained
sacrifice
which
people
make
for
safety
and
peace
runs
off
with
the
spoils
of
the
panic
the
point
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
though
we
won
the
military
contest
the
world
has
not
yet
quite
succeeded
in
winning
a
complete
victory
over
the
promoters
of
war
we
ought
not
to
forget
that
wars
are
a
purely
manufactured
evil
and
are
made
according
to
a
definite
technique
a
campaign
for
war
is
made
upon
as
definite
lines
as
a
campaign
for
any
other
purpose
first
the
people
are
worked
upon
by
clever
tales
the
people
suspicions
are
aroused
toward
the
nation
against
whom
war
is
desired
make
the
nation
suspicious
make
the
other
nation
suspicious
all
you
need
for
this
is
a
few
agents
with
some
cleverness
and
no
conscience
and
a
press
whose
interest
is
locked
up
with
the
interests
that
will
be
benefited
by
war
then
the
overt
act
will
soon
appear
it
is
no
trick
at
all
to
get
an
overt
act
once
you
work
the
hatred
of
two
nations
up
to
the
proper
pitch
there
were
men
in
every
country
who
were
glad
to
see
the
world
war
begin
and
sorry
to
see
it
stop
hundreds
of
american
fortunes
date
from
the
civil
war
thousands
of
new
fortunes
date
from
the
world
war
nobody
can
deny
that
war
is
a
profitable
business
for
those
who
like
that
kind
of
money
war
is
an
orgy
of
money
just
as
it
is
an
orgy
of
blood
and
we
should
not
so
easily
be
led
into
war
if
we
considered
what
it
is
that
makes
a
nation
really
great
it
is
not
the
amount
of
trade
that
makes
a
nation
great
the
creation
of
private
fortunes
like
the
creation
of
an
autocracy
does
not
make
any
country
great
nor
does
the
mere
change
of
an
agricultural
population
into
a
factory
population
a
country
becomes
great
when
by
the
wise
development
of
its
resources
and
the
skill
of
its
people
property
is
widely
and
fairly
distributed
foreign
trade
is
full
of
delusions
we
ought
to
wish
for
every
nation
as
large
a
degree
of
as
possible
instead
of
wishing
to
keep
them
dependent
on
us
for
what
we
manufacture
we
should
wish
them
to
learn
to
manufacture
themselves
and
build
up
a
solidly
founded
civilization
when
every
nation
learns
to
produce
the
things
which
it
can
produce
we
shall
be
able
to
get
down
to
a
basis
of
serving
each
other
along
those
special
lines
in
which
there
can
be
no
competition
the
north
temperate
zone
will
never
be
able
to
compete
with
the
tropics
in
the
special
products
of
the
tropics
our
country
will
never
be
a
competitor
with
the
orient
in
the
production
of
tea
nor
with
the
south
in
the
production
of
rubber
a
large
proportion
of
our
foreign
trade
is
based
on
the
backwardness
of
our
foreign
customers
selfishness
is
a
motive
that
would
preserve
that
backwardness
humanity
is
a
motive
that
would
help
the
backward
nations
to
a
basis
take
mexico
for
example
we
have
heard
a
great
deal
about
the
development
of
mexico
exploitation
is
the
word
that
ought
instead
to
be
used
when
its
rich
natural
resources
are
exploited
for
the
increase
of
the
private
fortunes
of
foreign
capitalists
that
is
not
development
it
is
ravishment
you
can
never
develop
mexico
until
you
develop
the
mexican
and
yet
how
much
of
the
development
of
mexico
by
foreign
exploiters
ever
took
account
of
the
development
of
its
people
the
mexican
peon
has
been
regarded
as
mere
fuel
for
the
foreign
foreign
trade
has
been
his
degradation
people
are
afraid
of
such
counsel
they
say
what
would
become
of
our
foreign
trade
when
the
natives
of
africa
begin
raising
their
own
cotton
and
the
natives
of
russia
begin
making
their
own
farming
implements
and
the
natives
of
china
begin
supplying
their
own
wants
it
will
make
a
difference
to
be
sure
but
does
any
thoughtful
man
imagine
that
the
world
can
long
continue
on
the
present
basis
of
a
few
nations
supplying
the
needs
of
the
world
we
must
think
in
terms
of
what
the
world
will
be
when
civilization
becomes
general
when
all
the
peoples
have
learned
to
help
themselves
when
a
country
goes
mad
about
foreign
trade
it
usually
depends
on
other
countries
for
its
raw
material
turns
its
population
into
factory
fodder
creates
a
private
rich
class
and
lets
its
own
immediate
interest
lie
neglected
here
in
the
united
states
we
have
enough
work
to
do
developing
our
own
country
to
relieve
us
of
the
necessity
of
looking
for
foreign
trade
for
a
long
time
we
have
agriculture
enough
to
feed
us
while
we
are
doing
it
and
money
enough
to
carry
the
job
through
is
there
anything
more
stupid
than
the
united
states
standing
idle
because
japan
or
france
or
any
other
country
has
not
sent
us
an
order
when
there
is
a
job
awaiting
us
in
developing
our
own
country
commerce
began
in
service
men
carried
off
their
surplus
to
people
who
had
none
the
country
that
raised
corn
carried
it
to
the
country
that
could
raise
no
corn
the
lumber
country
brought
wood
to
the
treeless
plain
the
vine
country
brought
fruit
to
cold
northern
climes
the
pasture
country
brought
meat
to
the
grassless
region
it
was
all
service
when
all
the
peoples
of
the
world
become
developed
in
the
art
of
commerce
will
get
back
to
that
basis
business
will
once
more
become
service
there
will
be
no
competition
because
the
basis
of
competition
will
have
vanished
the
varied
peoples
will
develop
skills
which
will
be
in
the
nature
of
monopolies
and
not
competitive
from
the
beginning
the
races
have
exhibited
distinct
strains
of
genius
this
one
for
government
another
for
colonization
another
for
the
sea
another
for
art
and
music
another
for
agriculture
another
for
business
and
so
on
lincoln
said
that
this
nation
could
not
survive
and
the
human
race
can
not
forever
exist
and
until
we
become
buyers
and
sellers
alike
producers
and
consumers
alike
keeping
the
balance
not
for
profit
but
for
service
we
are
going
to
have
conditions
france
has
something
to
give
the
world
of
which
no
competition
can
cheat
her
so
has
italy
so
has
russia
so
have
the
countries
of
south
america
so
has
japan
so
has
britain
so
has
the
united
states
the
sooner
we
get
back
to
a
basis
of
natural
specialties
and
drop
this
system
of
grab
the
sooner
we
shall
be
sure
of
international
and
international
peace
trying
to
take
the
trade
of
the
world
can
promote
war
it
can
not
promote
prosperity
some
day
even
the
international
bankers
will
learn
this
i
have
never
been
able
to
discover
any
honourable
reasons
for
the
beginning
of
the
world
war
it
seems
to
have
grown
out
of
a
very
complicated
situation
created
largely
by
those
who
thought
they
could
profit
by
war
i
believed
on
the
information
that
was
given
to
me
in
that
some
of
the
nations
were
anxious
for
peace
and
would
welcome
a
demonstration
for
peace
it
was
in
the
hope
that
this
was
true
that
i
financed
the
expedition
to
stockholm
in
what
has
since
been
called
the
peace
ship
i
do
not
regret
the
attempt
the
mere
fact
that
it
failed
is
not
to
me
conclusive
proof
that
it
was
not
worth
trying
we
learn
more
from
our
failures
than
from
our
successes
what
i
learned
on
that
trip
was
worth
the
time
and
the
money
expended
i
do
not
now
know
whether
the
information
as
conveyed
to
me
was
true
or
false
i
do
not
care
but
i
think
everyone
will
agree
that
if
it
had
been
possible
to
end
the
war
in
the
world
would
be
better
off
than
it
is
for
the
victors
wasted
themselves
in
winning
and
the
vanquished
in
resisting
nobody
got
an
advantage
honourable
or
dishonourable
out
of
that
war
i
had
hoped
finally
when
the
united
states
entered
the
war
that
it
might
be
a
war
to
end
wars
but
now
i
know
that
wars
do
not
end
wars
any
more
than
an
extraordinarily
large
conflagration
does
away
with
the
fire
hazard
when
our
country
entered
the
war
it
became
the
duty
of
every
citizen
to
do
his
utmost
toward
seeing
through
to
the
end
that
which
we
had
undertaken
i
believe
that
it
is
the
duty
of
the
man
who
opposes
war
to
oppose
going
to
war
up
until
the
time
of
its
actual
declaration
my
opposition
to
war
is
not
based
upon
pacifist
or
principles
it
may
be
that
the
present
state
of
civilization
is
such
that
certain
international
questions
can
not
be
discussed
it
may
be
that
they
have
to
be
fought
out
but
the
fighting
never
settles
the
question
it
only
gets
the
participants
around
to
a
frame
of
mind
where
they
will
agree
to
discuss
what
they
were
fighting
about
once
we
were
in
the
war
every
facility
of
the
ford
industries
was
put
at
the
disposal
of
the
government
we
had
up
to
the
time
of
the
declaration
of
war
absolutely
refused
to
take
war
orders
from
the
foreign
belligerents
it
is
entirely
out
of
keeping
with
the
principles
of
our
business
to
disturb
the
routine
of
our
production
unless
in
an
emergency
it
is
at
variance
with
our
human
principles
to
aid
either
side
in
a
war
in
which
our
country
was
not
involved
these
principles
had
no
application
once
the
united
states
entered
the
war
from
april
until
november
our
factory
worked
practically
exclusively
for
the
government
of
course
we
made
cars
and
parts
and
special
delivery
trucks
and
ambulances
as
a
part
of
our
general
production
but
we
also
made
many
other
articles
that
were
more
or
less
new
to
us
we
made
and
trucks
we
made
liberty
motors
in
great
quantities
aero
cylinders
mm
and
mm
caissons
we
made
listening
devices
steel
helmets
both
at
highland
park
and
philadelphia
and
eagle
boats
and
we
did
a
large
amount
of
experimental
work
on
armour
plate
compensators
and
body
armour
for
the
eagle
boats
we
put
up
a
special
plant
on
the
river
rouge
site
these
boats
were
designed
to
combat
the
submarines
they
were
feet
long
made
of
steel
and
one
of
the
conditions
precedent
to
their
building
was
that
their
construction
should
not
interfere
with
any
other
line
of
war
production
and
also
that
they
be
delivered
quickly
the
design
was
worked
out
by
the
navy
department
on
december
i
offered
to
build
the
boats
for
the
navy
the
discussion
terminated
on
january
when
the
navy
department
awarded
the
contract
to
the
ford
company
on
july
the
first
completed
boat
was
launched
we
made
both
the
hulls
and
the
engines
and
not
a
forging
or
a
rolled
beam
entered
into
the
construction
of
other
than
the
engine
we
stamped
the
hulls
entirely
out
of
sheet
steel
they
were
built
indoors
in
four
months
we
ran
up
a
building
at
the
river
rouge
a
third
of
a
mile
long
feet
wide
and
feet
high
covering
more
than
thirteen
acres
these
boats
were
not
built
by
marine
engineers
they
were
built
simply
by
applying
our
production
principles
to
a
new
product
with
the
armistice
we
at
once
dropped
the
war
and
went
back
to
peace
an
able
man
is
a
man
who
can
do
things
and
his
ability
to
do
things
is
dependent
on
what
he
has
in
him
what
he
has
in
him
depends
on
what
he
started
with
and
what
he
has
done
to
increase
and
discipline
it
an
educated
man
is
not
one
whose
memory
is
trained
to
carry
a
few
dates
in
history
he
is
one
who
can
accomplish
things
a
man
who
can
not
think
is
not
an
educated
man
however
many
college
degrees
he
may
have
acquired
thinking
is
the
hardest
work
any
one
can
do
which
is
probably
the
reason
why
we
have
so
few
thinkers
there
are
two
extremes
to
be
avoided
one
is
the
attitude
of
contempt
toward
education
the
other
is
the
tragic
snobbery
of
assuming
that
marching
through
an
educational
system
is
a
sure
cure
for
ignorance
and
mediocrity
you
can
not
learn
in
any
school
what
the
world
is
going
to
do
next
year
but
you
can
learn
some
of
the
things
which
the
world
has
tried
to
do
in
former
years
and
where
it
failed
and
where
it
succeeded
if
education
consisted
in
warning
the
young
student
away
from
some
of
the
false
theories
on
which
men
have
tried
to
build
so
that
he
may
be
saved
the
loss
of
the
time
in
finding
out
by
bitter
experience
its
good
would
be
unquestioned
an
education
which
consists
of
signposts
indicating
the
failure
and
the
fallacies
of
the
past
doubtless
would
be
very
useful
it
is
not
education
just
to
possess
the
theories
of
a
lot
of
professors
speculation
is
very
interesting
and
sometimes
profitable
but
it
is
not
education
to
be
learned
in
science
is
merely
to
be
aware
of
a
hundred
theories
that
have
not
been
proved
and
not
to
know
what
those
theories
are
is
to
be
uneducated
ignorant
and
so
forth
if
knowledge
of
guesses
is
learning
then
one
may
become
learned
by
the
simple
expedient
of
making
his
own
guesses
and
by
the
same
token
he
can
dub
the
rest
of
the
world
ignorant
because
it
does
not
know
what
his
guesses
are
but
the
best
that
education
can
do
for
a
man
is
to
put
him
in
possession
of
his
powers
give
him
control
of
the
tools
with
which
destiny
has
endowed
him
and
teach
him
how
to
think
the
college
renders
its
best
service
as
an
intellectual
gymnasium
in
which
mental
muscle
is
developed
and
the
student
strengthened
to
do
what
he
can
to
say
however
that
mental
gymnastics
can
be
had
only
in
college
is
not
true
as
every
educator
knows
a
man
real
education
begins
after
he
has
left
school
true
education
is
gained
through
the
discipline
of
life
there
are
many
kinds
of
knowledge
and
it
depends
on
what
crowd
you
happen
to
be
in
or
how
the
fashions
of
the
day
happen
to
run
which
kind
of
knowledge
is
most
respected
at
the
moment
there
are
fashions
in
knowledge
just
as
there
are
in
everything
else
when
some
of
us
were
lads
knowledge
used
to
be
limited
to
the
bible
there
were
certain
men
in
the
neighbourhood
who
knew
the
book
thoroughly
and
they
were
looked
up
to
and
respected
biblical
knowledge
was
highly
valued
then
but
nowadays
it
is
doubtful
whether
deep
acquaintance
with
the
bible
would
be
sufficient
to
win
a
man
a
name
for
learning
knowledge
to
my
mind
is
something
that
in
the
past
somebody
knew
and
left
in
a
form
which
enables
all
who
will
to
obtain
it
if
a
man
is
born
with
normal
human
faculties
if
he
is
equipped
with
enough
ability
to
use
the
tools
which
we
call
letters
in
reading
or
writing
there
is
no
knowledge
within
the
possession
of
the
race
that
he
can
not
have
if
he
wants
it
the
only
reason
why
every
man
does
not
know
everything
that
the
human
mind
has
ever
learned
is
that
no
one
has
ever
yet
found
it
worth
while
to
know
that
much
men
satisfy
their
minds
more
by
finding
out
things
for
themselves
than
by
heaping
together
the
things
which
somebody
else
has
found
out
you
can
go
out
and
gather
knowledge
all
your
life
and
with
all
your
gathering
you
will
not
catch
up
even
with
your
own
times
you
may
fill
your
head
with
all
the
facts
of
all
the
ages
and
your
head
may
be
just
an
overloaded
when
you
get
through
the
point
is
this
great
piles
of
knowledge
in
the
head
are
not
the
same
as
mental
activity
a
man
may
be
very
learned
and
very
useless
and
then
again
a
man
may
be
unlearned
and
very
useful
the
object
of
education
is
not
to
fill
a
man
mind
with
facts
it
is
to
teach
him
how
to
use
his
mind
in
thinking
and
it
often
happens
that
a
man
can
think
better
if
he
is
not
hampered
by
the
knowledge
of
the
past
it
is
a
very
human
tendency
to
think
that
what
mankind
does
not
yet
know
no
one
can
learn
and
yet
it
must
be
perfectly
clear
to
everyone
that
the
past
learning
of
mankind
can
not
be
allowed
to
hinder
our
future
learning
mankind
has
not
gone
so
very
far
when
you
measure
its
progress
against
the
knowledge
that
is
yet
to
be
gained
the
secrets
that
are
yet
to
be
learned
one
good
way
to
hinder
progress
is
to
fill
a
man
head
with
all
the
learning
of
the
past
it
makes
him
feel
that
because
his
head
is
full
there
is
nothing
more
to
learn
merely
gathering
knowledge
may
become
the
most
useless
work
a
man
can
do
what
can
you
do
to
help
and
heal
the
world
that
is
the
educational
test
if
a
man
can
hold
up
his
own
end
he
counts
for
one
if
he
can
help
ten
or
a
hundred
or
a
thousand
other
men
hold
up
their
ends
he
counts
for
more
he
may
be
quite
rusty
on
many
things
that
inhabit
the
realm
of
print
but
he
is
a
learned
man
just
the
same
when
a
man
is
master
of
his
own
sphere
whatever
it
may
be
he
has
won
his
degree
he
has
entered
the
realm
of
wisdom
the
work
which
we
describe
as
studies
in
the
jewish
question
and
which
is
variously
described
by
antagonists
as
the
jewish
campaign
the
attack
on
the
jews
the
pogrom
and
so
forth
needs
no
explanation
to
those
who
have
followed
it
its
motives
and
purposes
must
be
judged
by
the
work
itself
it
is
offered
as
a
contribution
to
a
question
which
deeply
affects
the
country
a
question
which
is
racial
at
its
source
and
which
concerns
influences
and
ideals
rather
than
persons
our
statements
must
be
judged
by
candid
readers
who
are
intelligent
enough
to
lay
our
words
alongside
life
as
they
are
able
to
observe
it
if
our
word
and
their
observation
agree
the
case
is
made
it
is
perfectly
silly
to
begin
to
damn
us
before
it
has
been
shown
that
our
statements
are
baseless
or
reckless
the
first
item
to
be
considered
is
the
truth
of
what
we
have
set
forth
and
that
is
precisely
the
item
which
our
critics
choose
to
evade
readers
of
our
articles
will
see
at
once
that
we
are
not
actuated
by
any
kind
of
prejudice
except
it
may
be
a
prejudice
in
favor
of
the
principles
which
have
made
our
civilization
there
had
been
observed
in
this
country
certain
streams
of
influence
which
were
causing
a
marked
deterioration
in
our
literature
amusements
and
social
conduct
business
was
departing
from
its
substantial
soundness
a
general
letting
down
of
standards
was
felt
everywhere
it
was
not
the
robust
coarseness
of
the
white
man
the
rude
indelicacy
say
of
shakespeare
characters
but
a
nasty
orientalism
which
has
insidiously
affected
every
channel
of
expression
and
to
such
an
extent
that
it
was
time
to
challenge
it
the
fact
that
these
influences
are
all
traceable
to
one
racial
source
is
a
fact
to
be
reckoned
with
not
by
us
only
but
by
the
intelligent
people
of
the
race
in
question
it
is
entirely
creditable
to
them
that
steps
have
been
taken
by
them
to
remove
their
protection
from
the
more
flagrant
violators
of
american
hospitality
but
there
is
still
room
to
discard
outworn
ideas
of
racial
superiority
maintained
by
economic
or
intellectually
subversive
warfare
upon
christian
society
our
work
does
not
pretend
to
say
the
last
word
on
the
jew
in
america
it
says
only
the
word
which
describes
his
obvious
present
impress
on
the
country
when
that
impress
is
changed
the
report
of
it
can
be
changed
for
the
present
then
the
question
is
wholly
in
the
jews
hands
if
they
are
as
wise
as
they
claim
to
be
they
will
labour
to
make
jews
american
instead
of
labouring
to
make
america
jewish
the
genius
of
the
united
states
of
america
is
christian
in
the
broadest
sense
and
its
destiny
is
to
remain
christian
this
carries
no
sectarian
meaning
with
it
but
relates
to
a
basic
principle
which
differs
from
other
principles
in
that
it
provides
for
liberty
with
morality
and
pledges
society
to
a
code
of
relations
based
on
fundamental
christian
conceptions
of
human
rights
and
duties
as
for
prejudice
or
hatred
against
persons
that
is
neither
american
nor
christian
our
opposition
is
only
to
ideas
false
ideas
which
are
sapping
the
moral
stamina
of
the
people
these
ideas
proceed
from
easily
identified
sources
they
are
promulgated
by
easily
discoverable
methods
and
they
are
controlled
by
mere
exposure
we
have
simply
used
the
method
of
exposure
when
people
learn
to
identify
the
source
and
nature
of
the
influence
swirling
around
them
it
is
sufficient
let
the
american
people
once
understand
that
it
is
not
natural
degeneracy
but
calculated
subversion
that
afflicts
us
and
they
are
safe
the
explanation
is
the
cure
this
work
was
taken
up
without
personal
motives
when
it
reached
a
stage
where
we
believed
the
american
people
could
grasp
the
key
we
let
it
rest
for
the
time
our
enemies
say
that
we
began
it
for
revenge
and
that
we
laid
it
down
in
fear
time
will
show
that
our
critics
are
merely
dealing
in
evasion
because
they
dare
not
tackle
the
main
question
time
will
also
show
that
we
are
better
friends
to
the
jews
best
interests
than
are
those
who
praise
them
to
their
faces
and
criticize
them
behind
their
backs

democracy
and
industry
perhaps
no
word
is
more
overworked
nowadays
than
the
word
democracy
and
those
who
shout
loudest
about
it
i
think
as
a
rule
want
it
least
i
am
always
suspicious
of
men
who
speak
glibly
of
democracy
i
wonder
if
they
want
to
set
up
some
kind
of
a
despotism
or
if
they
want
to
have
somebody
do
for
them
what
they
ought
to
do
for
themselves
i
am
for
the
kind
of
democracy
that
gives
to
each
an
equal
chance
according
to
his
ability
i
think
if
we
give
more
attention
to
serving
our
fellows
we
shall
have
less
concern
with
the
empty
forms
of
government
and
more
concern
with
the
things
to
be
done
thinking
of
service
we
shall
not
bother
about
good
feeling
in
industry
or
life
we
shall
not
bother
about
masses
and
classes
or
closed
and
open
shops
and
such
matters
as
have
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
real
business
of
living
we
can
get
down
to
facts
we
stand
in
need
of
facts
it
is
a
shock
when
the
mind
awakens
to
the
fact
that
not
all
of
humanity
is
human
that
whole
groups
of
people
do
not
regard
others
with
humane
feelings
great
efforts
have
been
made
to
have
this
appear
as
the
attitude
of
a
class
but
it
is
really
the
attitude
of
all
classes
in
so
far
as
they
are
swayed
by
the
false
notion
of
classes
before
when
it
was
the
constant
effort
of
propaganda
to
make
the
people
believe
that
it
was
only
the
rich
who
were
without
humane
feelings
the
opinion
became
general
that
among
the
poor
the
humane
virtues
flourished
but
the
rich
and
the
poor
are
both
very
small
minorities
and
you
can
not
classify
society
under
such
heads
there
are
not
enough
rich
and
there
are
not
enough
poor
to
serve
the
purpose
of
such
classification
rich
men
have
become
poor
without
changing
their
natures
and
poor
men
have
become
rich
and
the
problem
has
not
been
affected
by
it
between
the
rich
and
the
poor
is
the
great
mass
of
the
people
who
are
neither
rich
nor
poor
a
society
made
up
exclusively
of
millionaires
would
not
be
different
from
our
present
society
some
of
the
millionaires
would
have
to
raise
wheat
and
bake
bread
and
make
machinery
and
run
trains
else
they
would
all
starve
to
death
someone
must
do
the
work
really
we
have
no
fixed
classes
we
have
men
who
will
work
and
men
who
will
not
most
of
the
classes
that
one
reads
about
are
purely
fictional
take
certain
capitalist
papers
you
will
be
amazed
by
some
of
the
statements
about
the
labouring
class
we
who
have
been
and
still
are
a
part
of
the
labouring
class
know
that
the
statements
are
untrue
take
certain
of
the
labour
papers
you
are
equally
amazed
by
some
of
the
statements
they
make
about
capitalists
and
yet
on
both
sides
there
is
a
grain
of
truth
the
man
who
is
a
capitalist
and
nothing
else
who
gambles
with
the
fruits
of
other
men
labours
deserves
all
that
is
said
against
him
he
is
in
precisely
the
same
class
as
the
cheap
gambler
who
cheats
workingmen
out
of
their
wages
the
statements
we
read
about
the
labouring
class
in
the
capitalistic
press
are
seldom
written
by
managers
of
great
industries
but
by
a
class
of
writers
who
are
writing
what
they
think
will
please
their
employers
they
write
what
they
imagine
will
please
examine
the
labour
press
and
you
will
find
another
class
of
writers
who
similarly
seek
to
tickle
the
prejudices
which
they
conceive
the
labouring
man
to
have
both
kinds
of
writers
are
mere
propagandists
and
propaganda
that
does
not
spread
facts
is
and
it
should
be
you
can
not
preach
patriotism
to
men
for
the
purpose
of
getting
them
to
stand
still
while
you
rob
them
and
get
away
with
that
kind
of
preaching
very
long
you
can
not
preach
the
duty
of
working
hard
and
producing
plentifully
and
make
that
a
screen
for
an
additional
profit
to
yourself
and
neither
can
the
worker
conceal
the
lack
of
a
day
work
by
a
phrase
undoubtedly
the
employing
class
possesses
facts
which
the
employed
ought
to
have
in
order
to
construct
sound
opinions
and
pass
fair
judgments
undoubtedly
the
employed
possess
facts
which
are
equally
important
to
the
employer
it
is
extremely
doubtful
however
if
either
side
has
all
the
facts
and
this
is
where
propaganda
even
if
it
were
possible
for
it
to
be
entirely
successful
is
defective
it
is
not
desirable
that
one
set
of
ideas
be
put
over
on
a
class
holding
another
set
of
ideas
what
we
really
need
is
to
get
all
the
ideas
together
and
construct
from
them
take
for
instance
this
whole
matter
of
union
labour
and
the
right
to
strike
the
only
strong
group
of
union
men
in
the
country
is
the
group
that
draws
salaries
from
the
unions
some
of
them
are
very
rich
some
of
them
are
interested
in
influencing
the
affairs
of
our
large
institutions
of
finance
others
are
so
extreme
in
their
socialism
that
they
border
on
bolshevism
and
anarchism
their
union
salaries
liberating
them
from
the
necessity
of
work
so
that
they
can
devote
their
energies
to
subversive
propaganda
all
of
them
enjoy
a
certain
prestige
and
power
which
in
the
natural
course
of
competition
they
could
not
otherwise
have
won
if
the
official
personnel
of
the
labour
unions
were
as
strong
as
honest
as
decent
and
as
plainly
wise
as
the
bulk
of
the
men
who
make
up
the
membership
the
whole
movement
would
have
taken
on
a
different
complexion
these
last
few
years
but
this
official
personnel
in
the
main
there
are
notable
exceptions
has
not
devoted
itself
to
an
alliance
with
the
naturally
strong
qualities
of
the
workingman
it
has
rather
devoted
itself
to
playing
upon
his
weaknesses
principally
upon
the
weaknesses
of
that
newly
arrived
portion
of
the
population
which
does
not
yet
know
what
americanism
is
and
which
never
will
know
if
left
to
the
tutelage
of
their
local
union
leaders
the
workingmen
except
those
few
who
have
been
inoculated
with
the
fallacious
doctrine
of
the
class
war
and
who
have
accepted
the
philosophy
that
progress
consists
in
fomenting
discord
in
industry
when
you
get
your
a
day
do
stop
at
that
agitate
for
when
you
get
your
eight
hours
a
day
do
be
a
fool
and
grow
contented
agitate
for
six
hours
start
something
always
start
something
have
the
plain
sense
which
enables
them
to
recognize
that
with
principles
accepted
and
observed
conditions
change
the
union
leaders
have
never
seen
that
they
wish
conditions
to
remain
as
they
are
conditions
of
injustice
provocation
strikes
bad
feeling
and
crippled
national
life
else
where
would
be
the
need
for
union
officers
every
strike
is
a
new
argument
for
them
they
point
to
it
and
say
you
see
you
still
need
us
the
only
true
labour
leader
is
the
one
who
leads
labour
to
work
and
to
wages
and
not
the
leader
who
leads
labour
to
strikes
sabotage
and
starvation
the
union
of
labour
which
is
coming
to
the
fore
in
this
country
is
the
union
of
all
whose
interests
are
interdependent
whose
interests
are
altogether
dependent
on
the
usefulness
and
efficiency
of
the
service
they
render
there
is
a
change
coming
when
the
union
of
union
leaders
disappears
with
it
will
go
the
union
of
blind
bosses
bosses
who
never
did
a
decent
thing
for
their
employees
until
they
were
compelled
if
the
blind
boss
was
a
disease
the
selfish
union
leader
was
the
antidote
when
the
union
leader
became
the
disease
the
blind
boss
became
the
antidote
both
are
misfits
both
are
out
of
place
in
society
and
they
are
both
disappearing
together
it
is
the
blind
boss
whose
voice
is
heard
saying
now
is
the
time
to
smash
labour
we
got
them
on
the
run
that
voice
is
going
down
to
silence
with
the
voice
that
preaches
class
war
the
producers
from
the
men
at
the
drawing
board
to
the
men
on
the
moulding
floor
have
gotten
together
in
a
real
union
and
they
will
handle
their
own
affairs
henceforth
the
exploitation
of
dissatisfaction
is
an
established
business
its
object
is
not
to
settle
anything
nor
to
get
anything
done
but
to
keep
dissatisfaction
in
existence
and
the
instruments
used
to
do
this
are
a
whole
set
of
false
theories
and
promises
which
can
never
be
fulfilled
as
long
as
the
earth
remains
what
it
is
i
am
not
opposed
to
labour
organization
i
am
not
opposed
to
any
sort
of
organization
that
makes
for
progress
it
is
organizing
to
limit
production
whether
by
employers
or
by
workers
that
matters
the
workingman
himself
must
be
on
guard
against
some
very
dangerous
notions
dangerous
to
himself
and
to
the
welfare
of
the
country
it
is
sometimes
said
that
the
less
a
worker
does
the
more
jobs
he
creates
for
other
men
this
fallacy
assumes
that
idleness
is
creative
idleness
never
created
a
job
it
creates
only
burdens
the
industrious
man
never
runs
his
fellow
worker
out
of
a
job
indeed
it
is
the
industrious
man
who
is
the
partner
of
the
industrious
manager
who
creates
more
and
more
business
and
therefore
more
and
more
jobs
it
is
a
great
pity
that
the
idea
should
ever
have
gone
abroad
among
sensible
men
that
by
soldiering
on
the
job
they
help
someone
else
a
moment
thought
will
show
the
weakness
of
such
an
idea
the
healthy
business
the
business
that
is
always
making
more
and
more
opportunities
for
men
to
earn
an
honourable
and
ample
living
is
the
business
in
which
every
man
does
a
day
work
of
which
he
is
proud
and
the
country
that
stands
most
securely
is
the
country
in
which
men
work
honestly
and
do
not
play
tricks
with
the
means
of
production
we
can
not
play
fast
and
loose
with
economic
laws
because
if
we
do
they
handle
us
in
very
hard
ways
the
fact
that
a
piece
of
work
is
now
being
done
by
nine
men
which
used
to
be
done
by
ten
men
does
not
mean
that
the
tenth
man
is
unemployed
he
is
merely
not
employed
on
that
work
and
the
public
is
not
carrying
the
burden
of
his
support
by
paying
more
than
it
ought
on
that
work
for
after
all
it
is
the
public
that
pays
an
industrial
concern
which
is
wide
enough
awake
to
reorganize
for
efficiency
and
honest
enough
with
the
public
to
charge
it
necessary
costs
and
no
more
is
usually
such
an
enterprising
concern
that
it
has
plenty
of
jobs
at
which
to
employ
the
tenth
man
it
is
bound
to
grow
and
growth
means
jobs
a
concern
is
always
seeking
to
lower
the
labour
cost
to
the
public
and
it
is
certain
to
employ
more
men
than
the
concern
which
loafs
along
and
makes
the
public
pay
the
cost
of
its
mismanagement
the
tenth
man
was
an
unnecessary
cost
the
ultimate
consumer
was
paying
him
but
the
fact
that
he
was
unnecessary
on
that
particular
job
does
not
mean
that
he
is
unnecessary
in
the
work
of
the
world
or
even
in
the
work
of
his
particular
shop
the
public
pays
for
all
mismanagement
more
than
half
the
trouble
with
the
world
is
the
soldiering
and
dilution
and
cheapness
and
inefficiency
for
which
the
people
are
paying
their
good
money
wherever
two
men
are
being
paid
for
what
one
can
do
the
people
are
paying
double
what
they
ought
and
it
is
a
fact
that
only
a
little
while
ago
in
the
united
states
man
for
man
we
were
not
producing
what
we
did
for
several
years
previous
to
the
war
a
day
work
means
more
than
merely
being
on
duty
at
the
shop
for
the
required
number
of
hours
it
means
giving
an
equivalent
in
service
for
the
wage
drawn
and
when
that
equivalent
is
tampered
with
either
way
when
the
man
gives
more
than
he
receives
or
receives
more
than
he
gives
it
is
not
long
before
serious
dislocation
will
be
manifest
extend
that
condition
throughout
the
country
and
you
have
a
complete
upset
of
business
all
that
industrial
difficulty
means
is
the
destruction
of
basic
equivalents
in
the
shop
management
must
share
the
blame
with
labour
management
has
been
lazy
too
management
has
found
it
easier
to
hire
an
additional
five
hundred
men
than
to
so
improve
its
methods
that
one
hundred
men
of
the
old
force
could
be
released
to
other
work
the
public
was
paying
and
business
was
booming
and
management
did
care
a
pin
it
was
no
different
in
the
office
from
what
it
was
in
the
shop
the
law
of
equivalents
was
broken
just
as
much
by
managers
as
by
workmen
practically
nothing
of
importance
is
secured
by
mere
demand
that
is
why
strikes
always
fail
even
though
they
may
seem
to
succeed
a
strike
which
brings
higher
wages
or
shorter
hours
and
passes
on
the
burden
to
the
community
is
really
unsuccessful
it
only
makes
the
industry
less
able
to
serve
and
decreases
the
number
of
jobs
that
it
can
support
this
is
not
to
say
that
no
strike
is
justified
it
may
draw
attention
to
an
evil
men
can
strike
with
justice
that
they
will
thereby
get
justice
is
another
question
the
strike
for
proper
conditions
and
just
rewards
is
justifiable
the
pity
is
that
men
should
be
compelled
to
use
the
strike
to
get
what
is
theirs
by
right
no
american
ought
to
be
compelled
to
strike
for
his
rights
he
ought
to
receive
them
naturally
easily
as
a
matter
of
course
these
justifiable
strikes
are
usually
the
employer
fault
some
employers
are
not
fit
for
their
jobs
the
employment
of
men
the
direction
of
their
energies
the
arranging
of
their
rewards
in
honest
ratio
to
their
production
and
to
the
prosperity
of
the
business
is
no
small
job
an
employer
may
be
unfit
for
his
job
just
as
a
man
at
the
lathe
may
be
unfit
justifiable
strikes
are
a
sign
that
the
boss
needs
another
job
one
that
he
can
handle
the
unfit
employer
causes
more
trouble
than
the
unfit
employee
you
can
change
the
latter
to
another
more
suitable
job
but
the
former
must
usually
be
left
to
the
law
of
compensation
the
justified
strike
then
is
one
that
need
never
have
been
called
if
the
employer
had
done
his
work
there
is
a
second
kind
of
strike
the
strike
with
a
concealed
design
in
this
kind
of
strike
the
workingmen
are
made
the
tools
of
some
manipulator
who
seeks
his
own
ends
through
them
to
illustrate
here
is
a
great
industry
whose
success
is
due
to
having
met
a
public
need
with
efficient
and
skillful
production
it
has
a
record
for
justice
such
an
industry
presents
a
great
temptation
to
speculators
if
they
can
only
gain
control
of
it
they
can
reap
rich
benefit
from
all
the
honest
effort
that
has
been
put
into
it
they
can
destroy
its
beneficiary
wage
and
squeeze
every
last
dollar
out
of
the
public
the
product
and
the
workingman
and
reduce
it
to
the
plight
of
other
business
concerns
which
are
run
on
low
principles
the
motive
may
be
the
personal
greed
of
the
speculators
or
they
may
want
to
change
the
policy
of
a
business
because
its
example
is
embarrassing
to
other
employers
who
do
not
want
to
do
what
is
right
the
industry
can
not
be
touched
from
within
because
its
men
have
no
reason
to
strike
so
another
method
is
adopted
the
business
may
keep
many
outside
shops
busy
supplying
it
with
material
if
these
outside
shops
can
be
tied
up
then
that
great
industry
may
be
crippled
so
strikes
are
fomented
in
the
outside
industries
every
attempt
is
made
to
curtail
the
factory
source
of
supplies
if
the
workingmen
in
the
outside
shops
knew
what
the
game
was
they
would
refuse
to
play
it
but
they
do
know
they
serve
as
the
tools
of
designing
capitalists
without
knowing
it
there
is
one
point
however
that
ought
to
rouse
the
suspicions
of
workingmen
engaged
in
this
kind
of
strike
if
the
strike
can
not
get
itself
settled
no
matter
what
either
side
offers
to
do
it
is
almost
positive
proof
that
there
is
a
third
party
interested
in
having
the
strike
continue
that
hidden
influence
does
not
want
a
settlement
on
any
terms
if
such
a
strike
is
won
by
the
strikers
is
the
lot
of
the
workingman
improved
after
throwing
the
industry
into
the
hands
of
outside
speculators
are
the
workmen
given
any
better
treatment
or
wages
there
is
a
third
kind
of
strike
the
strike
that
is
provoked
by
the
money
interests
for
the
purpose
of
giving
labour
a
bad
name
the
american
workman
has
always
had
a
reputation
for
sound
judgment
he
has
not
allowed
himself
to
be
led
away
by
every
shouter
who
promised
to
create
the
millennium
out
of
thin
air
he
has
had
a
mind
of
his
own
and
has
used
it
he
has
always
recognized
the
fundamental
truth
that
the
absence
of
reason
was
never
made
good
by
the
presence
of
violence
in
his
way
the
american
workingman
has
won
a
certain
prestige
with
his
own
people
and
throughout
the
world
public
opinion
has
been
inclined
to
regard
with
respect
his
opinions
and
desires
but
there
seems
to
be
a
determined
effort
to
fasten
the
bolshevik
stain
on
american
labour
by
inciting
it
to
such
impossible
attitudes
and
such
wholly
actions
as
shall
change
public
sentiment
from
respect
to
criticism
merely
avoiding
strikes
however
does
not
promote
industry
we
may
say
to
the
workingman
you
have
a
grievance
but
the
strike
is
no
remedy
it
only
makes
the
situation
worse
whether
you
win
or
lose
then
the
workingman
may
admit
this
to
be
true
and
refrain
from
striking
does
that
settle
anything
no
if
the
worker
abandons
strikes
as
an
unworthy
means
of
bringing
about
desirable
conditions
it
simply
means
that
employers
must
get
busy
on
their
own
initiative
and
correct
defective
conditions
the
experience
of
the
ford
industries
with
the
workingman
has
been
entirely
satisfactory
both
in
the
united
states
and
abroad
we
have
no
antagonism
to
unions
but
we
participate
in
no
arrangements
with
either
employee
or
employer
organizations
the
wages
paid
are
always
higher
than
any
reasonable
union
could
think
of
demanding
and
the
hours
of
work
are
always
shorter
there
is
nothing
that
a
union
membership
could
do
for
our
people
some
of
them
may
belong
to
unions
probably
the
majority
do
not
we
do
not
know
and
make
no
attempt
to
find
out
for
it
is
a
matter
of
not
the
slightest
concern
to
us
we
respect
the
unions
sympathize
with
their
good
aims
and
denounce
their
bad
ones
in
turn
i
think
that
they
give
us
respect
for
there
has
never
been
any
authoritative
attempt
to
come
between
the
men
and
the
management
in
our
plants
of
course
radical
agitators
have
tried
to
stir
up
trouble
now
and
again
but
the
men
have
mostly
regarded
them
simply
as
human
oddities
and
their
interest
in
them
has
been
the
same
sort
of
interest
that
they
would
have
in
a
man
in
england
we
did
meet
the
trades
union
question
squarely
in
our
manchester
plant
the
workmen
of
manchester
are
mostly
unionized
and
the
usual
english
union
restrictions
upon
output
prevail
we
took
over
a
body
plant
in
which
were
a
number
of
union
carpenters
at
once
the
union
officers
asked
to
see
our
executives
and
arrange
terms
we
deal
only
with
our
own
employees
and
never
with
outside
representatives
so
our
people
refused
to
see
the
union
officials
thereupon
they
called
the
carpenters
out
on
strike
the
carpenters
would
not
strike
and
were
expelled
from
the
union
then
the
expelled
men
brought
suit
against
the
union
for
their
share
of
the
benefit
fund
i
do
not
know
how
the
litigation
turned
out
but
that
was
the
end
of
interference
by
trades
union
officers
with
our
operations
in
england
we
make
no
attempt
to
coddle
the
people
who
work
with
us
it
is
absolutely
a
relation
during
the
period
in
which
we
largely
increased
wages
we
did
have
a
considerable
supervisory
force
the
home
life
of
the
men
was
investigated
and
an
effort
was
made
to
find
out
what
they
did
with
their
wages
perhaps
at
the
time
it
was
necessary
it
gave
us
valuable
information
but
it
would
not
do
at
all
as
a
permanent
affair
and
it
has
been
abandoned
we
do
not
believe
in
the
glad
hand
or
the
professionalized
personal
touch
or
human
element
it
is
too
late
in
the
day
for
that
sort
of
thing
men
want
something
more
than
a
worthy
sentiment
social
conditions
are
not
made
out
of
words
they
are
the
net
result
of
the
daily
relations
between
man
and
man
the
best
social
spirit
is
evidenced
by
some
act
which
costs
the
management
something
and
which
benefits
all
that
is
the
only
way
to
prove
good
intentions
and
win
respect
propaganda
bulletins
lectures
they
are
nothing
it
is
the
right
act
sincerely
done
that
counts
a
great
business
is
really
too
big
to
be
human
it
grows
so
large
as
to
supplant
the
personality
of
the
man
in
a
big
business
the
employer
like
the
employee
is
lost
in
the
mass
together
they
have
created
a
great
productive
organization
which
sends
out
articles
that
the
world
buys
and
pays
for
in
return
money
that
provides
a
livelihood
for
everyone
in
the
business
the
business
itself
becomes
the
big
thing
there
is
something
sacred
about
a
big
business
which
provides
a
living
for
hundreds
and
thousands
of
families
when
one
looks
about
at
the
babies
coming
into
the
world
at
the
boys
and
girls
going
to
school
at
the
young
workingmen
who
on
the
strength
of
their
jobs
are
marrying
and
setting
up
for
themselves
at
the
thousands
of
homes
that
are
being
paid
for
on
installments
out
of
the
earnings
of
men
when
one
looks
at
a
great
productive
organization
that
is
enabling
all
these
things
to
be
done
then
the
continuance
of
that
business
becomes
a
holy
trust
it
becomes
greater
and
more
important
than
the
individuals
the
employer
is
but
a
man
like
his
employees
and
is
subject
to
all
the
limitations
of
humanity
he
is
justified
in
holding
his
job
only
as
he
can
fill
it
if
he
can
steer
the
business
straight
if
his
men
can
trust
him
to
run
his
end
of
the
work
properly
and
without
endangering
their
security
then
he
is
filling
his
place
otherwise
he
is
no
more
fit
for
his
position
than
would
be
an
infant
the
employer
like
everyone
else
is
to
be
judged
solely
by
his
ability
he
may
be
but
a
name
to
the
men
a
name
on
a
signboard
but
there
is
the
business
it
is
more
than
a
name
it
produces
the
living
and
a
living
is
a
pretty
tangible
thing
the
business
is
a
reality
it
does
things
it
is
a
going
concern
the
evidence
of
its
fitness
is
that
the
pay
envelopes
keep
coming
you
can
hardly
have
too
much
harmony
in
business
but
you
can
go
too
far
in
picking
men
because
they
harmonize
you
can
have
so
much
harmony
that
there
will
not
be
enough
of
the
thrust
and
counterthrust
which
is
life
enough
of
the
competition
which
means
effort
and
progress
it
is
one
thing
for
an
organization
to
be
working
harmoniously
toward
one
object
but
it
is
another
thing
for
an
organization
to
work
harmoniously
with
each
individual
unit
of
itself
some
organizations
use
up
so
much
energy
and
time
maintaining
a
feeling
of
harmony
that
they
have
no
force
left
to
work
for
the
object
for
which
the
organization
was
created
the
organization
is
secondary
to
the
object
the
only
harmonious
organization
that
is
worth
anything
is
an
organization
in
which
all
the
members
are
bent
on
the
one
main
purpose
to
get
along
toward
the
objective
a
common
purpose
honestly
believed
in
sincerely
desired
that
is
the
great
harmonizing
principle
i
pity
the
poor
fellow
who
is
so
soft
and
flabby
that
he
must
always
have
an
atmosphere
of
good
feeling
around
him
before
he
can
do
his
work
there
are
such
men
and
in
the
end
unless
they
obtain
enough
mental
and
moral
hardiness
to
lift
them
out
of
their
soft
reliance
on
feeling
they
are
failures
not
only
are
they
business
failures
they
are
character
failures
also
it
is
as
if
their
bones
never
attained
a
sufficient
degree
of
hardness
to
enable
them
to
stand
on
their
own
feet
there
is
altogether
too
much
reliance
on
good
feeling
in
our
business
organizations
people
have
too
great
a
fondness
for
working
with
the
people
they
like
in
the
end
it
spoils
a
good
many
valuable
qualities
do
not
misunderstand
me
when
i
use
the
term
good
feeling
i
mean
that
habit
of
making
one
personal
likes
and
dislikes
the
sole
standard
of
judgment
suppose
you
do
not
like
a
man
is
that
anything
against
him
it
may
be
something
against
you
what
have
your
likes
or
dislikes
to
do
with
the
facts
every
man
of
common
sense
knows
that
there
are
men
whom
he
dislikes
who
are
really
more
capable
than
he
is
himself
and
taking
all
this
out
of
the
shop
and
into
the
broader
fields
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
rich
to
love
the
poor
or
the
poor
to
love
the
rich
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
employer
to
love
the
employee
or
for
the
employee
to
love
the
employer
what
is
necessary
is
that
each
should
try
to
do
justice
to
the
other
according
to
his
deserts
that
is
real
democracy
and
not
the
question
of
who
ought
to
own
the
bricks
and
the
mortar
and
the
furnaces
and
the
mills
and
democracy
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
who
ought
to
be
boss
that
is
very
much
like
asking
who
ought
to
be
the
tenor
in
the
quartet
obviously
the
man
who
can
sing
tenor
you
could
not
have
deposed
caruso
suppose
some
theory
of
musical
democracy
had
consigned
caruso
to
the
musical
proletariat
would
that
have
reared
another
tenor
to
take
his
place
or
would
caruso
gifts
have
still
remained
his
own
chapter
xix
what
we
may
expect
we
are
unless
i
do
not
read
the
signs
aright
in
the
midst
of
a
change
it
is
going
on
all
about
us
slowly
and
scarcely
observed
but
with
a
firm
surety
we
are
gradually
learning
to
relate
cause
and
effect
a
great
deal
of
that
which
we
call
disturbance
a
great
deal
of
the
upset
in
what
have
seemed
to
be
established
institutions
is
really
but
the
surface
indication
of
something
approaching
a
regeneration
the
public
point
of
view
is
changing
and
we
really
need
only
a
somewhat
different
point
of
view
to
make
the
very
bad
system
of
the
past
into
a
very
good
system
of
the
future
we
are
displacing
that
peculiar
virtue
which
used
to
be
admired
as
and
which
was
really
only
with
intelligence
and
also
we
are
getting
rid
of
mushy
sentimentalism
the
first
confused
hardness
with
progress
the
second
confused
softness
with
progress
we
are
getting
a
better
view
of
the
realities
and
are
beginning
to
know
that
we
have
already
in
the
world
all
things
needful
for
the
fullest
kind
of
a
life
and
that
we
shall
use
them
better
once
we
learn
what
they
are
and
what
they
mean
whatever
is
wrong
and
we
all
know
that
much
is
wrong
can
be
righted
by
a
clear
definition
of
the
wrongness
we
have
been
looking
so
much
at
one
another
at
what
one
has
and
another
lacks
that
we
have
made
a
personal
affair
out
of
something
that
is
too
big
for
personalities
to
be
sure
human
nature
enters
largely
into
our
economic
problems
selfishness
exists
and
doubtless
it
colours
all
the
competitive
activities
of
life
if
selfishness
were
the
characteristic
of
any
one
class
it
might
be
easily
dealt
with
but
it
is
in
human
fibre
everywhere
and
greed
exists
and
envy
exists
and
jealousy
exists
but
as
the
struggle
for
mere
existence
grows
less
and
it
is
less
than
it
used
to
be
although
the
sense
of
uncertainty
may
have
increased
we
have
an
opportunity
to
release
some
of
the
finer
motives
we
think
less
of
the
frills
of
civilization
as
we
grow
used
to
them
progress
as
the
world
has
thus
far
known
it
is
accompanied
by
a
great
increase
in
the
things
of
life
there
is
more
gear
more
wrought
material
in
the
average
american
backyard
than
in
the
whole
domain
of
an
african
king
the
average
american
boy
has
more
paraphernalia
around
him
than
a
whole
eskimo
community
the
utensils
of
kitchen
dining
room
bedroom
and
coal
cellar
make
a
list
that
would
have
staggered
the
most
luxurious
potentate
of
five
hundred
years
ago
the
increase
in
the
impedimenta
of
life
only
marks
a
stage
we
are
like
the
indian
who
comes
into
town
with
all
his
money
and
buys
everything
he
sees
there
is
no
adequate
realization
of
the
large
proportion
of
the
labour
and
material
of
industry
that
is
used
in
furnishing
the
world
with
its
trumpery
and
trinkets
which
are
made
only
to
be
sold
and
are
bought
merely
to
be
owned
that
perform
no
service
in
the
world
and
are
at
last
mere
rubbish
as
at
first
they
were
mere
waste
humanity
is
advancing
out
of
its
stage
and
industry
is
coming
down
to
meet
the
needs
and
thus
we
may
expect
further
advancement
toward
that
life
which
many
now
see
but
which
the
present
good
enough
stage
hinders
our
attaining
and
we
are
growing
out
of
this
worship
of
material
possessions
it
is
no
longer
a
distinction
to
be
rich
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
be
rich
is
no
longer
a
common
ambition
people
do
not
care
for
money
as
money
as
they
once
did
certainly
they
do
not
stand
in
awe
of
it
nor
of
him
who
possesses
it
what
we
accumulate
by
way
of
useless
surplus
does
us
no
honour
it
takes
only
a
moment
thought
to
see
that
as
far
as
individual
personal
advantage
is
concerned
vast
accumulations
of
money
mean
nothing
a
human
being
is
a
human
being
and
is
nourished
by
the
same
amount
and
quality
of
food
is
warmed
by
the
same
weight
of
clothing
whether
he
be
rich
or
poor
and
no
one
can
inhabit
more
than
one
room
at
a
time
but
if
one
has
visions
of
service
if
one
has
vast
plans
which
no
ordinary
resources
could
possibly
realize
if
one
has
a
life
ambition
to
make
the
industrial
desert
bloom
like
the
rose
and
the
life
suddenly
blossom
into
fresh
and
enthusiastic
human
motives
of
higher
character
and
efficiency
then
one
sees
in
large
sums
of
money
what
the
farmer
sees
in
his
seed
corn
the
beginning
of
new
and
richer
harvests
whose
benefits
can
no
more
be
selfishly
confined
than
can
the
rays
there
are
two
fools
in
this
world
one
is
the
millionaire
who
thinks
that
by
hoarding
money
he
can
somehow
accumulate
real
power
and
the
other
is
the
penniless
reformer
who
thinks
that
if
only
he
can
take
the
money
from
one
class
and
give
it
to
another
all
the
world
ills
will
be
cured
they
are
both
on
the
wrong
track
they
might
as
well
try
to
corner
all
the
checkers
or
all
the
dominoes
of
the
world
under
the
delusion
that
they
are
thereby
cornering
great
quantities
of
skill
some
of
the
most
successful
of
our
times
have
never
added
one
pennyworth
to
the
wealth
of
men
does
a
card
player
add
to
the
wealth
of
the
world
if
we
all
created
wealth
up
to
the
limits
the
easy
limits
of
our
creative
capacity
then
it
would
simply
be
a
case
of
there
being
enough
for
everybody
and
everybody
getting
enough
any
real
scarcity
of
the
necessaries
of
life
in
the
world
not
a
fictitious
scarcity
caused
by
the
lack
of
clinking
metallic
disks
in
one
purse
is
due
only
to
lack
of
production
and
lack
of
production
is
due
only
too
often
to
lack
of
knowledge
of
how
and
what
to
produce
this
much
we
must
believe
as
a
starting
point
that
the
earth
produces
or
is
capable
of
producing
enough
to
give
decent
sustenance
to
everyone
not
of
food
alone
but
of
everything
else
we
need
for
everything
is
produced
from
the
earth
that
it
is
possible
for
labour
production
distribution
and
reward
to
be
so
organized
as
to
make
certain
that
those
who
contribute
shall
receive
shares
determined
by
an
exact
justice
that
regardless
of
the
frailties
of
human
nature
our
economic
system
can
be
so
adjusted
that
selfishness
although
perhaps
not
abolished
can
be
robbed
of
power
to
work
serious
economic
injustice
the
business
of
life
is
easy
or
hard
according
to
the
skill
or
the
lack
of
skill
displayed
in
production
and
distribution
it
has
been
thought
that
business
existed
for
profit
that
is
wrong
business
exists
for
service
it
is
a
profession
and
must
have
recognized
professional
ethics
to
violate
which
declasses
a
man
business
needs
more
of
the
professional
spirit
the
professional
spirit
seeks
professional
integrity
from
pride
not
from
compulsion
the
professional
spirit
detects
its
own
violations
and
penalizes
them
business
will
some
day
become
clean
a
machine
that
stops
every
little
while
is
an
imperfect
machine
and
its
imperfection
is
within
itself
a
body
that
falls
sick
every
little
while
is
a
diseased
body
and
its
disease
is
within
itself
so
with
business
its
faults
many
of
them
purely
the
faults
of
the
moral
constitution
of
business
clog
its
progress
and
make
it
sick
every
little
while
some
day
the
ethics
of
business
will
be
universally
recognized
and
in
that
day
business
will
be
seen
to
be
the
oldest
and
most
useful
of
all
the
professions
all
that
the
ford
industries
have
done
all
that
i
have
done
is
to
endeavour
to
evidence
by
works
that
service
comes
before
profit
and
that
the
sort
of
business
which
makes
the
world
better
for
its
presence
is
a
noble
profession
often
it
has
come
to
me
that
what
is
regarded
as
the
somewhat
remarkable
progression
of
our
enterprises
i
will
not
say
success
for
that
word
is
an
epitaph
and
we
are
just
starting
is
due
to
some
accident
and
that
the
methods
which
we
have
used
while
well
enough
in
their
way
fit
only
the
making
of
our
particular
products
and
would
not
do
at
all
in
any
other
line
of
business
or
indeed
for
any
products
or
personalities
other
than
our
own
it
used
to
be
taken
for
granted
that
our
theories
and
our
methods
were
fundamentally
unsound
that
is
because
they
were
not
understood
events
have
killed
that
kind
of
comment
but
there
remains
a
wholly
sincere
belief
that
what
we
have
done
could
not
be
done
by
any
other
company
that
we
have
been
touched
by
a
wand
that
neither
we
nor
any
one
else
could
make
shoes
or
hats
or
sewing
machines
or
watches
or
typewriters
or
any
other
necessity
after
the
manner
in
which
we
make
automobiles
and
tractors
and
that
if
only
we
ventured
into
other
fields
we
should
right
quickly
discover
our
errors
i
do
not
agree
with
any
of
this
nothing
has
come
out
of
the
air
the
foregoing
pages
should
prove
that
we
have
nothing
that
others
might
not
have
we
have
had
no
good
fortune
except
that
which
always
attends
any
one
who
puts
his
best
into
his
work
there
was
nothing
that
could
be
called
favorable
about
our
beginning
we
began
with
almost
nothing
what
we
have
we
earned
and
we
earned
it
by
unremitting
labour
and
faith
in
a
principle
we
took
what
was
a
luxury
and
turned
it
into
a
necessity
and
without
trick
or
subterfuge
when
we
began
to
make
our
present
motor
car
the
country
had
few
good
roads
gasoline
was
scarce
and
the
idea
was
firmly
implanted
in
the
public
mind
that
an
automobile
was
at
the
best
a
rich
man
toy
our
only
advantage
was
lack
of
precedent
we
began
to
manufacture
according
to
a
creed
a
creed
which
was
at
that
time
unknown
in
business
the
new
is
always
thought
odd
and
some
of
us
are
so
constituted
that
we
can
never
get
over
thinking
that
anything
which
is
new
must
be
odd
and
probably
queer
the
mechanical
working
out
of
our
creed
is
constantly
changing
we
are
continually
finding
new
and
better
ways
of
putting
it
into
practice
but
we
have
not
found
it
necessary
to
alter
the
principles
and
i
can
not
imagine
how
it
might
ever
be
necessary
to
alter
them
because
i
hold
that
they
are
absolutely
universal
and
must
lead
to
a
better
and
wider
life
for
all
if
i
did
not
think
so
i
would
not
keep
working
for
the
money
that
i
make
is
inconsequent
money
is
useful
only
as
it
serves
to
forward
by
practical
example
the
principle
that
business
is
justified
only
as
it
serves
that
it
must
always
give
more
to
the
community
than
it
takes
away
and
that
unless
everybody
benefits
by
the
existence
of
a
business
then
that
business
should
not
exist
i
have
proved
this
with
automobiles
and
tractors
i
intend
to
prove
it
with
railways
and
corporations
not
for
my
personal
satisfaction
and
not
for
the
money
that
may
be
earned
it
is
perfectly
impossible
applying
these
principles
to
avoid
making
a
much
larger
profit
than
if
profit
were
the
main
object
i
want
to
prove
it
so
that
all
of
us
may
have
more
and
that
all
of
us
may
live
better
by
increasing
the
service
rendered
by
all
businesses
poverty
can
not
be
abolished
by
formula
it
can
be
abolished
only
by
hard
and
intelligent
work
we
are
in
effect
an
experimental
station
to
prove
a
principle
that
we
do
make
money
is
only
further
proof
that
we
are
right
for
that
is
a
species
of
argument
that
establishes
itself
without
words
in
the
first
chapter
was
set
forth
the
creed
let
me
repeat
it
in
the
light
of
the
work
that
has
been
done
under
it
for
it
is
at
the
basis
of
all
our
work
an
absence
of
fear
of
the
future
or
of
veneration
for
the
past
one
who
fears
the
future
who
fears
failure
limits
his
activities
failure
is
only
the
opportunity
more
intelligently
to
begin
again
there
is
no
disgrace
in
honest
failure
there
is
disgrace
in
fearing
to
fail
what
is
past
is
useful
only
as
it
suggests
ways
and
means
for
progress
a
disregard
of
competition
whoever
does
a
thing
best
ought
to
be
the
one
to
do
it
it
is
criminal
to
try
to
get
business
away
from
another
man
criminal
because
one
is
then
trying
to
lower
for
personal
gain
the
condition
of
one
to
rule
by
force
instead
of
by
intelligence
the
putting
of
service
before
profit
without
a
profit
business
can
not
extend
there
is
nothing
inherently
wrong
about
making
a
profit
business
enterprises
can
not
fail
to
return
a
profit
but
profit
must
and
inevitably
will
come
as
a
reward
for
good
service
it
can
not
be
the
basis
it
must
be
the
result
of
service
manufacturing
is
not
buying
low
and
selling
high
it
is
the
process
of
buying
materials
fairly
and
with
the
smallest
possible
addition
of
cost
transforming
those
materials
into
a
consumable
product
and
distributing
it
to
the
consumer
gambling
speculating
and
sharp
dealing
tend
only
to
clog
this
progression
we
must
have
production
but
it
is
the
spirit
behind
it
that
counts
most
that
kind
of
production
which
is
a
service
inevitably
follows
a
real
desire
to
be
of
service
the
various
wholly
artificial
rules
set
up
for
finance
and
industry
and
which
pass
as
laws
break
down
with
such
frequency
as
to
prove
that
they
are
not
even
good
guesses
the
basis
of
all
economic
reasoning
is
the
earth
and
its
products
to
make
the
yield
of
the
earth
in
all
its
forms
large
enough
and
dependable
enough
to
serve
as
the
basis
for
real
life
the
life
which
is
more
than
eating
and
sleeping
is
the
highest
service
that
is
the
real
foundation
for
an
economic
system
we
can
make
things
the
problem
of
production
has
been
solved
brilliantly
we
can
make
any
number
of
different
sort
of
things
by
the
millions
the
material
mode
of
our
life
is
splendidly
provided
for
there
are
enough
processes
and
improvements
now
pigeonholed
and
awaiting
application
to
bring
the
physical
side
of
life
to
almost
millennial
completeness
but
we
are
too
wrapped
up
in
the
things
we
are
doing
we
are
not
enough
concerned
with
the
reasons
why
we
do
them
our
whole
competitive
system
our
whole
creative
expression
all
the
play
of
our
faculties
seem
to
be
centred
around
material
production
and
its
of
success
and
wealth
there
is
for
instance
a
feeling
that
personal
or
group
benefit
can
be
had
at
the
expense
of
other
persons
or
groups
there
is
nothing
to
be
gained
by
crushing
any
one
if
the
farmer
bloc
should
crush
the
manufacturers
would
the
farmers
be
better
off
if
the
bloc
should
crush
the
farmers
would
the
manufacturers
be
better
off
could
capital
gain
by
crushing
labour
or
labour
by
crushing
capital
or
does
a
man
in
business
gain
by
crushing
a
competitor
no
destructive
competition
benefits
no
one
the
kind
of
competition
which
results
in
the
defeat
of
the
many
and
the
overlordship
of
the
ruthless
few
must
go
destructive
competition
lacks
the
qualities
out
of
which
progress
comes
progress
comes
from
a
generous
form
of
rivalry
bad
competition
is
personal
it
works
for
the
aggrandizement
of
some
individual
or
group
it
is
a
sort
of
warfare
it
is
inspired
by
a
desire
to
get
someone
it
is
wholly
selfish
that
is
to
say
its
motive
is
not
pride
in
the
product
nor
a
desire
to
excel
in
service
nor
yet
a
wholesome
ambition
to
approach
to
scientific
methods
of
production
it
is
moved
simply
by
the
desire
to
crowd
out
others
and
monopolize
the
market
for
the
sake
of
the
money
returns
that
being
accomplished
it
always
substitutes
a
product
of
inferior
quality
freeing
ourselves
from
the
petty
sort
of
destructive
competition
frees
us
from
many
set
notions
we
are
too
closely
tied
to
old
methods
and
single
uses
we
need
more
mobility
we
have
been
using
certain
things
just
one
way
we
have
been
sending
certain
goods
through
only
one
channel
and
when
that
use
is
slack
or
that
channel
is
stopped
business
stops
too
and
all
the
sorry
consequences
of
depression
set
in
take
corn
for
example
there
are
millions
upon
millions
of
bushels
of
corn
stored
in
the
united
states
with
no
visible
outlet
a
certain
amount
of
corn
is
used
as
food
for
man
and
beast
but
not
all
of
it
in
days
a
certain
amount
of
corn
went
into
the
making
of
liquor
which
was
not
a
very
good
use
for
good
corn
but
through
a
long
course
of
years
corn
followed
those
two
channels
and
when
one
of
them
stopped
the
stocks
of
corn
began
to
pile
up
it
is
the
money
fiction
that
usually
retards
the
movement
of
stocks
but
even
if
money
were
plentiful
we
could
not
possibly
consume
the
stores
of
food
which
we
sometimes
possess
if
foodstuffs
become
too
plentiful
to
be
consumed
as
food
why
not
find
other
uses
for
them
why
use
corn
only
for
hogs
and
distilleries
why
sit
down
and
bemoan
the
terrible
disaster
that
has
befallen
the
corn
market
is
there
no
use
for
corn
besides
the
making
of
pork
or
the
making
of
whisky
surely
there
must
be
there
should
be
so
many
uses
for
corn
that
only
the
important
uses
could
ever
be
fully
served
there
ought
always
be
enough
channels
open
to
permit
corn
to
be
used
without
waste
once
upon
a
time
the
farmers
burned
corn
as
fuel
corn
was
plentiful
and
coal
was
scarce
that
was
a
crude
way
to
dispose
of
corn
but
it
contained
the
germ
of
an
idea
there
is
fuel
in
corn
oil
and
fuel
alcohol
are
obtainable
from
corn
and
it
is
high
time
that
someone
was
opening
up
this
new
use
so
that
the
corn
crops
may
be
moved
why
have
only
one
string
to
our
bow
why
not
two
if
one
breaks
there
is
the
other
if
the
hog
business
slackens
why
should
not
the
farmer
turn
his
corn
into
tractor
fuel
we
need
more
diversity
all
round
the
system
everywhere
would
not
be
a
bad
idea
we
have
a
money
system
it
is
a
mighty
fine
system
for
those
who
own
it
it
is
a
perfect
system
for
the
financiers
who
literally
own
the
commodity
called
money
and
who
literally
own
the
machinery
by
which
money
is
made
and
used
let
them
keep
their
system
if
they
like
it
but
the
people
are
finding
out
that
it
is
a
poor
system
for
what
we
call
hard
times
because
it
ties
up
the
line
and
stops
traffic
if
there
are
special
protections
for
the
interests
there
ought
also
to
be
special
protections
for
the
plain
people
diversity
of
outlet
of
use
and
of
financial
enablement
are
the
strongest
defenses
we
can
have
against
economic
emergencies
it
is
likewise
with
labour
there
surely
ought
to
be
flying
squadrons
of
young
men
who
would
be
available
for
emergency
conditions
in
harvest
field
mine
shop
or
railroad
if
the
fires
of
a
hundred
industries
threaten
to
go
out
for
lack
of
coal
and
one
million
men
are
menaced
by
unemployment
it
would
seem
both
good
business
and
good
humanity
for
a
sufficient
number
of
men
to
volunteer
for
the
mines
and
the
railroads
there
is
always
something
to
be
done
in
this
world
and
only
ourselves
to
do
it
the
whole
world
may
be
idle
and
in
the
factory
sense
there
may
be
nothing
to
do
there
may
be
nothing
to
do
in
this
place
or
that
but
there
is
always
something
to
do
it
is
this
fact
which
should
urge
us
to
such
an
organization
of
ourselves
that
this
something
to
be
done
may
get
done
and
unemployment
reduced
to
a
minimum
every
advance
begins
in
a
small
way
and
with
the
individual
the
mass
can
be
no
better
than
the
sum
of
the
individuals
advancement
begins
within
the
man
himself
when
he
advances
from
to
strength
of
purpose
when
he
advances
from
hesitancy
to
decisive
directness
when
he
advances
from
immaturity
to
maturity
of
judgment
when
he
advances
from
apprenticeship
to
mastery
when
he
advances
from
a
mere
at
labour
to
a
worker
who
finds
a
genuine
joy
in
work
when
he
advances
from
an
to
one
who
can
be
entrusted
to
do
his
work
without
oversight
and
without
prodding
why
then
the
world
advances
the
advance
is
not
easy
we
live
in
flabby
times
when
men
are
being
taught
that
everything
ought
to
be
easy
work
that
amounts
to
anything
will
never
be
easy
and
the
higher
you
go
in
the
scale
of
responsibility
the
harder
becomes
the
job
ease
has
its
place
of
course
every
man
who
works
ought
to
have
sufficient
leisure
the
man
who
works
hard
should
have
his
easy
chair
his
comfortable
fireside
his
pleasant
surroundings
these
are
his
by
right
but
no
one
deserves
ease
until
after
his
work
is
done
it
will
never
be
possible
to
put
upholstered
ease
into
work
some
work
is
needlessly
hard
it
can
be
lightened
by
proper
management
every
device
ought
to
be
employed
to
leave
a
man
free
to
do
a
man
work
flesh
and
blood
should
not
be
made
to
bear
burdens
that
steel
can
bear
but
even
when
the
best
is
done
work
still
remains
work
and
any
man
who
puts
himself
into
his
job
will
feel
that
it
is
work
and
there
can
not
be
much
picking
and
choosing
the
appointed
task
may
be
less
than
was
expected
a
man
real
work
is
not
always
what
he
would
have
chosen
to
do
a
man
real
work
is
what
he
is
chosen
to
do
just
now
there
are
more
menial
jobs
than
there
will
be
in
the
future
and
as
long
as
there
are
menial
jobs
someone
will
have
to
do
them
but
there
is
no
reason
why
a
man
should
be
penalized
because
his
job
is
menial
there
is
one
thing
that
can
be
said
about
menial
jobs
that
can
not
be
said
about
a
great
many
more
responsible
jobs
and
that
is
they
are
useful
and
they
are
respectable
and
they
are
honest
the
time
has
come
when
drudgery
must
be
taken
out
of
labour
it
is
not
work
that
men
object
to
but
the
element
of
drudgery
we
must
drive
out
drudgery
wherever
we
find
it
we
shall
never
be
wholly
civilized
until
we
remove
the
treadmill
from
the
daily
job
invention
is
doing
this
in
some
degree
now
we
have
succeeded
to
a
very
great
extent
in
relieving
men
of
the
heavier
and
more
onerous
jobs
that
used
to
sap
their
strength
but
even
when
lightening
the
heavier
labour
we
have
not
yet
succeeded
in
removing
monotony
that
is
another
field
that
beckons
us
the
abolition
of
monotony
and
in
trying
to
accomplish
that
we
shall
doubtless
discover
other
changes
that
will
have
to
be
made
in
our
system
the
opportunity
to
work
is
now
greater
than
ever
it
was
the
opportunity
to
advance
is
greater
it
is
true
that
the
young
man
who
enters
industry
enters
a
very
different
system
from
that
in
which
the
young
man
of
years
ago
began
his
career
the
system
has
been
tightened
up
there
is
less
play
or
friction
in
it
fewer
matters
are
left
to
the
haphazard
will
of
the
individual
the
modern
worker
finds
himself
part
of
an
organization
which
apparently
leaves
him
little
initiative
yet
with
all
this
it
is
not
true
that
men
are
mere
machines
it
is
not
true
that
opportunity
has
been
lost
in
organization
if
the
young
man
will
liberate
himself
from
these
ideas
and
regard
the
system
as
it
is
he
will
find
that
what
he
thought
was
a
barrier
is
really
an
aid
factory
organization
is
not
a
device
to
prevent
the
expansion
of
ability
but
a
device
to
reduce
the
waste
and
losses
due
to
mediocrity
it
is
not
a
device
to
hinder
the
ambitious
man
from
doing
his
best
but
a
device
to
prevent
the
sort
of
individual
from
doing
his
worst
that
is
to
say
when
laziness
carelessness
slothfulness
and
are
allowed
to
have
their
own
way
everybody
suffers
the
factory
can
not
prosper
and
therefore
can
not
pay
living
wages
when
an
organization
makes
it
necessary
for
the
class
to
do
better
than
they
naturally
would
it
is
for
their
benefit
they
are
better
physically
mentally
and
financially
what
wages
should
we
be
able
to
pay
if
we
trusted
a
large
class
to
their
own
methods
and
gait
of
production
if
the
factory
system
which
brought
mediocrity
up
to
a
higher
standard
operated
also
to
keep
ability
down
to
a
lower
standard
it
would
be
a
very
bad
system
a
very
bad
system
indeed
but
a
system
even
a
perfect
one
must
have
able
individuals
to
operate
it
no
system
operates
itself
and
the
modern
system
needs
more
brains
for
its
operation
than
did
the
old
more
brains
are
needed
than
ever
before
although
perhaps
they
are
not
needed
in
the
same
place
as
they
once
were
it
is
just
like
power
formerly
every
machine
was
run
by
foot
power
the
power
was
right
at
the
machine
but
nowadays
we
have
moved
the
power
back
concentrated
it
in
the
thus
also
we
have
made
it
unnecessary
for
the
highest
types
of
mental
ability
to
be
engaged
in
every
operation
in
the
factory
the
better
brains
are
in
the
mental
every
business
that
is
growing
is
at
the
same
time
creating
new
places
for
capable
men
it
can
not
help
but
do
so
this
does
not
mean
that
new
openings
come
every
day
and
in
groups
not
at
all
they
come
only
after
hard
work
it
is
the
fellow
who
can
stand
the
gaff
of
routine
and
still
keep
himself
alive
and
alert
who
finally
gets
into
direction
it
is
not
sensational
brilliance
that
one
seeks
in
business
but
sound
substantial
dependability
big
enterprises
of
necessity
move
slowly
and
cautiously
the
young
man
with
ambition
ought
to
take
a
long
look
ahead
and
leave
an
ample
margin
of
time
for
things
to
happen
a
great
many
things
are
going
to
change
we
shall
learn
to
be
masters
rather
than
servants
of
nature
with
all
our
fancied
skill
we
still
depend
largely
on
natural
resources
and
think
that
they
can
not
be
displaced
we
dig
coal
and
ore
and
cut
down
trees
we
use
the
coal
and
the
ore
and
they
are
gone
the
trees
can
not
be
replaced
within
a
lifetime
we
shall
some
day
harness
the
heat
that
is
all
about
us
and
no
longer
depend
on
coal
we
may
now
create
heat
through
electricity
generated
by
water
power
we
shall
improve
on
that
method
as
chemistry
advances
i
feel
quite
certain
that
a
method
will
be
found
to
transform
growing
things
into
substances
that
will
endure
better
than
the
metals
we
have
scarcely
touched
the
uses
of

better
