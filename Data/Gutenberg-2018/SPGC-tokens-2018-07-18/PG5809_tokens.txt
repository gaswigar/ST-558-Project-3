it
is
your
human
environment
that
makes
climate
wilson
new
calendar
night
close
to
australia
now
sydney
miles
distant
that
note
recalls
an
experience
the
passengers
were
sent
for
to
come
up
in
the
bow
and
see
a
fine
sight
it
was
very
dark
one
could
not
follow
with
the
eye
the
surface
of
the
sea
more
than
fifty
yards
in
any
direction
it
dimmed
away
and
became
lost
to
sight
at
about
that
distance
from
us
but
if
you
patiently
gazed
into
the
darkness
a
little
while
there
was
a
sure
reward
for
you
presently
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
you
would
see
a
blinding
splash
or
explosion
of
light
on
the
water
a
flash
so
sudden
and
so
astonishingly
brilliant
that
it
would
make
you
catch
your
breath
then
that
blotch
of
light
would
instantly
extend
itself
and
take
the
corkscrew
shape
and
imposing
length
of
the
fabled
with
every
curve
of
its
body
and
the
break
spreading
away
from
its
head
and
the
wake
following
behind
its
tail
clothed
in
a
fierce
splendor
of
living
fire
and
my
but
it
was
coming
at
a
lightning
gait
almost
before
you
could
think
this
monster
of
light
fifty
feet
long
would
go
flaming
and
storming
by
and
suddenly
disappear
and
out
in
the
distance
whence
he
came
you
would
see
another
flash
and
another
and
another
and
another
and
see
them
turn
into
on
the
instant
and
once
sixteen
flashed
up
at
the
same
time
and
came
tearing
towards
us
a
swarm
of
wiggling
curves
a
moving
conflagration
a
vision
of
bewildering
beauty
a
spectacle
of
fire
and
energy
whose
equal
the
most
of
those
people
will
not
see
again
until
after
they
are
dead
it
was
porpoises
porpoises
aglow
with
phosphorescent
light
they
presently
collected
in
a
wild
and
magnificent
jumble
under
the
bows
and
there
they
played
for
an
hour
leaping
and
frollicking
and
carrying
on
turning
summersaults
in
front
of
the
stem
or
across
it
and
never
getting
hit
never
making
a
miscalculation
though
the
stem
missed
them
only
about
an
inch
as
a
rule
they
were
porpoises
of
the
ordinary
length
eight
or
ten
feet
but
every
twist
of
their
bodies
sent
a
long
procession
of
united
and
glowing
curves
astern
that
fiery
jumble
was
an
enchanting
thing
to
look
at
and
we
stayed
out
the
performance
one
can
not
have
such
a
show
as
that
twice
in
a
lifetime
the
porpoise
is
the
kitten
of
the
sea
he
never
has
a
serious
thought
he
cares
for
nothing
but
fun
and
play
but
i
think
i
never
saw
him
at
his
winsomest
until
that
night
it
was
near
a
center
of
civilization
and
he
could
have
been
drinking
by
and
by
when
we
had
approached
to
somewhere
within
thirty
miles
of
sydney
heads
the
great
electric
light
that
is
posted
on
one
of
those
lofty
ramparts
began
to
show
and
in
time
the
little
spark
grew
to
a
great
sun
and
pierced
the
firmament
of
darkness
with
a
sword
of
light
sydney
harbor
is
shut
in
behind
a
precipice
that
extends
some
miles
like
a
wall
and
exhibits
no
break
to
the
ignorant
stranger
it
has
a
break
in
the
middle
but
it
makes
so
little
show
that
even
captain
cook
sailed
by
it
without
seeing
it
near
by
that
break
is
a
false
break
which
resembles
it
and
which
used
to
make
trouble
for
the
mariner
at
night
in
the
early
days
before
the
place
was
lighted
it
caused
the
memorable
disaster
to
the
duncan
dunbar
one
of
the
most
pathetic
tragedies
in
the
history
of
that
pitiless
ruffian
the
sea
the
ship
was
a
sailing
vessel
a
fine
and
favorite
passenger
packet
commanded
by
a
popular
captain
of
high
reputation
she
was
due
from
england
and
sydney
was
waiting
and
counting
the
hours
counting
the
hours
and
making
ready
to
give
her
a
welcome
for
she
was
bringing
back
a
great
company
of
mothers
and
daughters
the
light
and
bloom
of
life
of
sydney
homes
daughters
that
had
been
years
absent
at
school
and
mothers
that
had
been
with
them
all
that
time
watching
over
them
of
all
the
world
only
india
and
australasia
have
by
custom
freighted
ships
and
fleets
with
their
hearts
and
know
the
tremendous
meaning
of
that
phrase
only
they
know
what
the
waiting
is
like
when
this
freightage
is
entrusted
to
the
fickle
winds
not
steam
and
what
the
joy
is
like
when
the
ship
that
is
returning
this
treasure
comes
safe
to
port
and
the
long
dread
is
over
on
board
the
duncan
dunbar
flying
toward
sydney
heads
in
the
waning
afternoon
the
happy
made
busy
preparation
for
it
was
not
doubted
that
they
would
be
in
the
arms
of
their
friends
before
the
day
was
done
they
put
away
their
clothes
and
put
on
clothes
meeter
for
the
meeting
their
richest
and
their
loveliest
these
poor
brides
of
the
grave
but
the
wind
lost
force
or
there
was
a
miscalculation
and
before
the
heads
were
sighted
the
darkness
came
on
it
was
said
that
ordinarily
the
captain
would
have
made
a
safe
offing
and
waited
for
the
morning
but
this
was
no
ordinary
occasion
all
about
him
were
appealing
faces
faces
pathetic
with
disappointment
so
his
sympathy
moved
him
to
try
the
dangerous
passage
in
the
dark
he
had
entered
the
heads
seventeen
times
and
believed
he
knew
the
ground
so
he
steered
straight
for
the
false
opening
mistaking
it
for
the
true
one
he
did
not
find
out
that
he
was
wrong
until
it
was
too
late
there
was
no
saving
the
ship
the
great
seas
swept
her
in
and
crushed
her
to
splinters
and
rubbish
upon
the
rock
tushes
at
the
base
of
the
precipice
not
one
of
all
that
fair
and
gracious
company
was
ever
seen
again
alive
the
tale
is
told
to
every
stranger
that
passes
the
spot
and
it
will
continue
to
be
told
to
all
that
come
for
generations
but
it
will
never
grow
old
custom
can
not
stale
it
the
that
is
in
it
can
never
perish
out
of
it
there
were
two
hundred
persons
in
the
ship
and
but
one
survived
the
disaster
he
was
a
sailor
a
huge
sea
flung
him
up
the
face
of
the
precipice
and
stretched
him
on
a
narrow
shelf
of
rock
midway
between
the
top
and
the
bottom
and
there
he
lay
all
night
at
any
other
time
he
would
have
lain
there
for
the
rest
of
his
life
without
chance
of
discovery
but
the
next
morning
the
ghastly
news
swept
through
sydney
that
the
duncan
dunbar
had
gone
down
in
sight
of
home
and
straightway
the
walls
of
the
heads
were
black
with
mourners
and
one
of
these
stretching
himself
out
over
the
precipice
to
spy
out
what
might
be
seen
below
discovered
this
miraculously
preserved
relic
of
the
wreck
ropes
were
brought
and
the
nearly
impossible
feat
of
rescuing
the
man
was
accomplished
he
was
a
person
with
a
practical
turn
of
mind
and
he
hired
a
hall
in
sydney
and
exhibited
himself
at
sixpence
a
head
till
he
exhausted
the
output
of
the
gold
fields
for
that
year
we
entered
and
cast
anchor
and
in
the
morning
went
and
in
admiration
up
through
the
crooks
and
turns
of
the
spacious
and
beautiful
harbor
a
harbor
which
is
the
darling
of
sydney
and
the
wonder
of
the
world
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
people
are
proud
of
it
nor
that
they
put
their
enthusiasm
into
eloquent
words
a
returning
citizen
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
it
and
i
testified
with
a
cordiality
which
i
judged
would
be
up
to
the
market
rate
i
said
it
was
beautiful
superbly
beautiful
then
by
a
natural
impulse
i
gave
god
the
praise
the
citizen
did
not
seem
altogether
satisfied
he
said
it
is
beautiful
of
course
it
beautiful
the
harbor
but
that
all
of
it
it
only
half
of
it
sydney
the
other
half
and
it
takes
both
of
them
together
to
ring
the
god
made
the
harbor
and
that
all
right
but
satan
made
sydney
of
course
i
made
an
apology
and
asked
him
to
convey
it
to
his
friend
he
was
right
about
sydney
being
half
of
it
it
would
be
beautiful
without
sydney
but
not
above
half
as
beautiful
as
it
is
now
with
sydney
added
it
is
shaped
somewhat
like
an
roomy
sheet
of
lovely
blue
water
with
narrow
of
water
running
up
into
the
country
on
both
sides
between
long
fingers
of
land
high
wooden
ridges
with
sides
sloped
like
graves
handsome
villas
are
perched
here
and
there
on
these
ridges
snuggling
amongst
the
foliage
and
one
catches
alluring
glimpses
of
them
as
the
ship
swims
by
toward
the
city
the
city
clothes
a
cluster
of
hills
and
a
ruffle
of
neighboring
ridges
with
its
undulating
masses
of
masonry
and
out
of
these
masses
spring
towers
and
spires
and
other
architectural
dignities
and
grandeurs
that
break
the
flowing
lines
and
give
picturesqueness
to
the
general
effect
the
narrow
inlets
which
i
have
mentioned
go
wandering
out
into
the
land
everywhere
and
hiding
themselves
in
it
and
are
always
exploring
them
with
picnic
parties
on
board
it
is
said
by
trustworthy
people
that
if
you
explore
them
all
you
will
find
that
you
have
covered
miles
of
water
passage
but
there
are
liars
everywhere
this
year
and
they
will
double
that
when
their
works
are
in
good
going
order
october
was
close
at
hand
spring
was
come
it
was
really
spring
everybody
said
so
but
you
could
have
sold
it
for
summer
in
canada
and
nobody
would
have
suspected
it
was
the
very
weather
that
makes
our
home
summers
the
perfection
of
climatic
luxury
i
mean
when
you
are
out
in
the
wood
or
by
the
sea
but
these
people
said
it
was
cool
now
a
person
ought
to
see
sydney
in
the
summer
time
if
he
wanted
to
know
what
warm
weather
is
and
he
ought
to
go
north
ten
or
fifteen
hundred
miles
if
he
wanted
to
know
what
hot
weather
is
they
said
that
away
up
there
toward
the
equator
the
hens
laid
fried
eggs
sydney
is
the
place
to
go
to
get
information
about
other
people
climates
it
seems
to
me
that
the
occupation
of
unbiased
traveler
seeking
information
is
the
pleasantest
and
most
irresponsible
trade
there
is
the
traveler
can
always
find
out
anything
he
wants
to
merely
by
asking
he
can
get
at
all
the
facts
and
more
everybody
helps
him
nobody
hinders
him
anybody
who
has
an
old
fact
in
stock
that
is
no
longer
negotiable
in
the
domestic
market
will
let
him
have
it
at
his
own
price
an
accumulation
of
such
goods
is
easily
and
quickly
made
they
cost
almost
nothing
and
they
bring
par
in
the
foreign
market
travelers
who
come
to
america
always
freight
up
with
the
same
old
nursery
tales
that
their
predecessors
selected
and
they
carry
them
back
and
always
work
them
off
without
any
trouble
in
the
home
market
if
the
climates
of
the
world
were
determined
by
parallels
of
latitude
then
we
could
know
a
place
climate
by
its
position
on
the
map
and
so
we
should
know
that
the
climate
of
sydney
was
the
counterpart
of
the
climate
of
columbia
and
of
little
rock
arkansas
since
sydney
is
about
the
same
distance
south
of
the
equator
that
those
other
towns
are
north
degrees
but
no
climate
disregards
the
parallels
of
latitude
in
arkansas
they
have
a
winter
in
sydney
they
have
the
name
of
it
but
not
the
thing
itself
i
have
seen
the
ice
in
the
mississippi
floating
past
the
mouth
of
the
arkansas
river
and
at
memphis
but
a
little
way
above
the
mississippi
has
been
frozen
over
from
bank
to
bank
but
they
have
never
had
a
cold
spell
in
sydney
which
brought
the
mercury
down
to
freezing
point
once
in
a
day
there
in
the
month
of
july
the
mercury
went
down
to
and
that
remains
the
memorable
cold
day
in
the
history
of
the
town
no
doubt
little
rock
has
seen
it
below
zero
once
in
sydney
in
about
new
year
day
the
mercury
went
up
to
deg
in
the
shade
and
that
is
sydney
memorable
hot
day
that
would
about
tally
with
little
rock
hottest
day
also
i
imagine
my
sydney
figures
are
taken
from
a
government
report
and
are
trustworthy
in
the
matter
of
summer
weather
arkansas
has
no
advantage
over
sydney
perhaps
but
when
it
comes
to
winter
weather
that
is
another
affair
you
could
cut
up
an
arkansas
winter
into
a
hundred
sydney
winters
and
have
enough
left
for
arkansas
and
the
poor
the
whole
narrow
hilly
belt
of
the
pacific
side
of
new
south
wales
has
the
climate
of
its
capital
a
mean
winter
temperature
of
deg
and
a
mean
summer
one
of
deg
it
is
a
climate
which
can
not
be
improved
upon
for
healthfulness
but
the
experts
say
that
deg
in
new
south
wales
is
harder
to
bear
than
deg
in
the
neighboring
colony
of
victoria
because
the
atmosphere
of
the
former
is
humid
and
of
the
latter
dry
the
mean
temperature
of
the
southernmost
point
of
new
south
wales
is
the
same
as
that
of
nice
yet
nice
is
further
from
the
equator
by
miles
than
is
the
former
but
nature
is
always
stingy
of
perfect
climates
stingier
in
the
case
of
australia
than
usual
apparently
this
vast
continent
has
a
really
good
climate
nowhere
but
around
the
edges
if
we
look
at
a
map
of
the
world
we
are
surprised
to
see
how
big
australia
is
it
is
about
as
large
as
the
united
states
was
before
we
added
alaska
but
where
as
one
finds
a
sufficiently
good
climate
and
fertile
land
almost
everywhere
in
the
united
states
it
seems
settled
that
inside
of
the
australian
one
finds
many
deserts
and
in
spots
a
climate
which
nothing
can
stand
except
a
few
of
the
hardier
kinds
of
rocks
in
effect
australia
is
as
yet
unoccupied
if
you
take
a
map
of
the
united
states
and
leave
the
atlantic
states
in
their
places
also
the
fringe
of
southern
states
from
florida
west
to
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
also
a
narrow
inhabited
streak
up
the
mississippi
to
its
head
waters
also
a
narrow
inhabited
border
along
the
pacific
coast
then
take
a
brushful
of
paint
and
obliterate
the
whole
remaining
mighty
stretch
of
country
that
lies
between
the
atlantic
states
and
the
strip
your
map
will
look
like
the
latest
map
of
australia
this
stupendous
blank
is
hot
not
to
say
torrid
a
part
of
it
is
fertile
the
rest
is
desert
it
is
not
liberally
watered
it
has
no
towns
one
has
only
to
cross
the
mountains
of
new
south
wales
and
descend
into
the
regions
to
find
that
he
has
left
the
choice
climate
behind
him
and
found
a
new
one
of
a
quite
different
character
in
fact
he
would
not
know
by
the
thermometer
that
he
was
not
in
the
blistering
plains
of
india
captain
sturt
the
great
explorer
gives
us
a
sample
of
the
heat
the
wind
which
had
been
blowing
all
the
morning
from
the
increased
to
a
heavy
gale
and
i
shall
never
forget
its
withering
effect
i
sought
shelter
behind
a
large
but
the
blasts
of
heat
were
so
terrific
that
i
wondered
the
very
grass
did
not
take
fire
this
really
was
nothing
ideal
everything
both
animate
and
inanimate
gave
way
before
it
the
horses
stood
with
their
backs
to
the
wind
and
their
noses
to
the
ground
without
the
muscular
strength
to
raise
their
heads
the
birds
were
mute
and
the
leaves
of
the
trees
under
which
we
were
sitting
fell
like
a
snow
shower
around
us
at
noon
i
took
a
thermometer
graded
to
out
of
my
box
and
observed
that
the
mercury
was
up
to
thinking
that
it
had
been
unduly
influenced
i
put
it
in
the
fork
of
a
tree
close
to
me
sheltered
alike
from
the
wind
and

hour
afterwards
when
i
found
the

and
had
burst

circumstance
that
i
believe
no
traveler
has
ever
before
had
to
record
i
can
not
find
language
to
convey
to
the
reader
mind
an
idea
of
the
intense
and
oppressive
nature
of
the
heat
that
prevailed

sweeps
over

sometimes
and
brings
with

if
you
leave
out
the

still
the
shovel
part
is
a
pretty
important
part
and
seems
to
indicate
that
my
nevada
storm
is
but
a
poor
thing
after
all
as
we
proceeded
the
altitude
became
less
and
the
heat
proportionately
greater
until
we
reached
dubbo
which
is
only
feet
above

a
pretty
town

on
an
extensive
plain
after

effects
of

shower
of
rain
have
passed
away
the
surface
of
the
ground
crumbles
into
a
thick
layer
of
dust
and
occasionally
when
the
wind
is
in
a
particular
quarter
it
is
lifted
bodily
from
the
ground
in
one
long
opaque
cloud
in
the
midst
of
such
a
storm
nothing
can
be
seen
a
few
yards
ahead
and
the
unlucky
person
who
happens
to
be
out
at
the
time
is
compelled
to
seek
the
nearest
retreat

when
the
thrifty
housewife
sees
in
the
distance
the
dark
column
advancing
in
a
steady
whirl
towards
her
house

closes
the
doors
and
windows

all
expedition

has
been
carelessly
left

indeed
an
extraordinary
sight
a
lady
who
has
resided
in
dubbo
for
some
years
says
that
the
dust
lies
so
thick
on
the
carpet
that
it
is
necessary
to
use
a
shovel
to
remove
it
and
probably
a
wagon
i
was
mistaken
i
have
not
seen
a
proper
duststorm
to
my
mind
the
exterior
aspects
and
character
of
australia
are
fascinating
things
to
look
at
and
think
about
they
are
so
strange
so
weird
so

so

in

was
a

in

for

on

with

it
was
said
that
this
terrible
punishment
was
able
to
bring

in

gave
a
convict
fifty

almost
any
little
offense
and
sometimes
a
brutal
officer
would
add
fifty
and
then
another
fifty

so
on
as
long
as
the

could

i
read
the
entry
in
an
old
manuscript
official
record
of
a
case
where
a
convict
was
given
three
hundred
lashes
for
stealing
some
silver
spoons
and
men
got
more
than
that
sometimes
who
handled
the
cat
often
it
was
another
convict
sometimes
it
was
the
culprit
dearest
comrade
and
he
had
to
lay
on
with
all
his
might
otherwise
he
would
get
a
flogging
himself
for
his
mercy
for
he
was
under
watch
and
yet
not
do
his

any
good
the
friend
would
be
attended
to
by
another
hand
and
suffer
no
lack
in
the
matter
of
full
punishment
the
convict
life
in
tasmania
was
so
unendurable
and
suicide
so
difficult
to
accomplish
that
once
or
twice
despairing
men
got
together
and
drew
straws
to
determine
which
of
them
should
kill
another
of
the
group
this
murder
to
secure
death
to
the
perpetrator
and
to
the
witnesses
of
it
by
the
hand
of
the
hangman
the
incidents
quoted
above
are
mere
hints
mere
suggestions
of
what
convict
life
was
like
they
are
but
a
couple
of
details
tossed
into
view
out
of
a
shoreless
sea
of
such
or
to
change
the
figure
they
are
but
a
pair
of
flaming
steeples
photographed
from
a
point
which
hides
from
sight
the
burning
city
which
stretches
away
from
their
bases
on
every
hand
some
of
the
convicts
indeed
a
good
many
of
them
were
very
bad
people
even
for
that
day
but
the
most
of
them
were
probably
not
noticeably
worse
than
the
average
of
the
people
they
left
behind
them
at
home
we
must
believe
this
we
can
not
avoid
it
we
are
obliged
to
believe
that
a
nation
that
could
look
on
unmoved
and
see
starving
or
freezing
women
hanged
for
stealing
cents
worth
of
bacon
or
rags
and
boys
snatched
from
their
mothers
and
men
from
their
families
and
sent
to
the
other
side
of
the
world
for
long
terms
of
years
for
similar
trifling
offenses
was
a
nation
to
whom
the
term
civilized
could
not
in
any
large
way
be
applied
and
we
must
also
believe
that
a
nation
that
knew
during
more
than
forty
years
what
was
happening
to
those
exiles
and
was
still
content
with
it
was
not
advancing
in
any
showy
way
toward
a
higher
grade
of
civilization
if
we
look
into
the
characters
and
conduct
of
the
officers
and
gentlemen
who
had
charge
of
the
convicts
and
attended
to
their
backs
and
stomachs
we
must
grant
again
that
as
between
the
convict
and
his
masters
and
between
both
and
the
nation
at
home
there
was
a
quite
noticeable
monotony
of
sameness
four
years
had
gone
by
and
many
convicts
had
come
respectable
settlers
were
beginning
to
arrive
these
two
classes
of
colonists
had
to
be
protected
in
case
of
trouble
among
themselves
or
with
the
natives
it
is
proper
to
mention
the
natives
though
they
could
hardly
count
they
were
so
scarce
at
a
time
when
they
had
not
as
yet
begun
to
be
much
disturbed
not
as
yet
being
in
the
way
it
was
estimated
that
in
new
south
wales
there
was
but
one
native
to
acres
of
territory
people
had
to
be
protected
officers
of
the
regular
army
did
not
want
this
service
away
off
there
where
neither
honor
nor
distinction
was
to
be
gained
so
england
recruited
and
officered
a
kind
of
militia
force
of
uniformed
civilians
called
the
new
south
wales
corps
and
shipped
it
this
was
the
worst
blow
of
all
the
colony
fairly
staggered
under
it
the
corps
was
an
of
the
moral
condition
of
england
outside
of
the
jails
the
colonists
trembled
it
was
feared
that
next
there
would
be
an
importation
of
the
nobility
in
those
early
days
the
colony
was
all
the
necessaries
of
life
food
clothing
and
all
were
sent
out
from
england
and
kept
in
great
government
and
given
to
the
convicts
and
sold
to
the
settlers
sold
at
a
trifling
advance
upon
cost
the
corps
saw
its
opportunity
its
officers
went
into
commerce
and
in
a
most
lawless
way
they
went
to
importing
rum
and
also
to
manufacturing
it
in
private
stills
in
defiance
of
the
government
commands
and
protests
they
leagued
themselves
together
and
ruled
the
market
they
boycotted
the
government
and
the
other
dealers
they
established
a
close
monopoly
and
kept
it
strictly
in
their
own
hands
when
a
vessel
arrived
with
spirits
they
allowed
nobody
to
buy
but
themselves
and
they
forced
the
owner
to
sell
to
them
at
a
price
named
by
themselves
and
it
was
always
low
enough
they
bought
rum
at
an
average
of
two
dollars
a
gallon
and
sold
it
at
an
average
of
ten
they
made
rum
the
currency
of
the
country
for
there
was
little
or
no
money
and
they
maintained
their
devastating
hold
and
kept
the
colony
under
their
heel
for
eighteen
or
twenty
years
before
they
were
finally
conquered
and
routed
by
the
government
meantime
they
had
spread
intemperance
everywhere
and
they
had
squeezed
farm
after
farm
out
of
the
settlers
hands
for
rum
and
thus
had
bountifully
enriched
themselves
when
a
farmer
was
caught
in
the
last
agonies
of
thirst
they
took
advantage
of
him
and
sweated
him
for
a
drink
in
one
instance
they
sold
a
man
a
gallon
of
rum
worth
two
dollars
for
a
piece
of
property
which
was
sold
some
years
later
for
when
the
colony
was
about
eighteen
or
twenty
years
old
it
was
discovered
that
the
land
was
specially
fitted
for
the

try

their
hospitality
the
treatment
which
we
experienced
at
the
hands
of
this
people
will
help
more
than
anything
else
to
make
us
recollect
with

our
stay
amongst

in
the
character
of
hosts
and

they
excel
the

needs
only
the
acquaintanceship
of
one
of
their
number
and
he
becomes
at
once
the
happy
recipient
of
numerous
complimentary
invitations
and
thoughtful
kindnesses
of
the
towns
it
has
been
our
good
fortune
to
visit
none
have
portrayed
home
so
faithfully
as
sydney
nobody
could
say
it
finer
than
that
if
he
had
put
in
his
cork
then
and
stayed
away
from
dubbo
but
no
heedless
man
he
pulled
it
again
pulled
it
when
he
was
away
along
in
his
book
and
his
memory
of
what
he
had
said
about
sydney
had
grown
dim
we
can
not
quit
the
promising
town
of
dubbo
without
testifying
in
warm
praise
to
the
and
hospitable
usages
of
its
inhabitants
sydney
though
well
deserving
the
character
it
bears
of
its
kindly
treatment
of
strangers
possesses
a
little
formality
and
reserve
in
dubbo
on
the
contrary
though
the
same
congenial
manners
prevail
there
is
a
pleasing
degree
of
respectful
familiarity
which
gives
the
town
a
homely
comfort
not
often
met
with
elsewhere
in
laying
on
one
side
our
pen
we
feel
contented
in
having
been
able
though
so
late
in
this
work
to
bestow
a
panegyric
however
unpretentious
on
a
town
which
though
possessing
no
picturesque
natural
surroundings
nor
interesting
architectural
productions
has
yet
a
body
of
citizens
whose
hearts
can
not
but
obtain
for
their
town
a
reputation
for
benevolence
and
i
wonder
what
soured
him
on
sydney
it
seems
strange
that
a
pleasing
degree
of
three
or
four
fingers
of
respectful
familiarity
should
fill
a
man
up
and
give
him
the
panegyrics
so
bad
for
he
has
them
the
worst
way
any
one
can
see
that
a
man
who
is
perfectly
at
himself
does
not
throw
cold
detraction
at
people
architectural
productions
and
picturesque
surroundings
and
let
on
that
what
he
prefers
is
a
dubbonese
and
a
pleasing
degree
of
respectful
familiarity
no
these
are
old
old
symptoms
and
when
they
appear
we
know
that
the
man
has
got
the
panegyrics
sydney
has
a
population
of
when
a
stranger
from
america
steps
ashore
there
the
first
thing
that
strikes
him
is
that
the
place
is
eight
or
nine
times
as
large
as
he
was
expecting
it
to
be
and
the
next
thing
that
strikes
him
is
that
it
is
an
english
city
with
american
trimmings
later
on
in
melbourne
he
will
find
the
american
trimmings
still
more
in
evidence
there
even
the
architecture
will
often
suggest
america
a
photograph
of
its
stateliest
business
street
might
be
passed
upon
him
for
a
picture
of
the
finest
street
in
a
large
american
city
i
was
told
that
the
most
of
the
fine
residences
were
the
city
residences
of
squatters
the
name
seemed
out
of
focus
somehow
when
the
explanation
came
it
offered
a
new
instance
of
the
curious
changes
which
words
as
well
as
animals
undergo
through
change
of
habitat
and
climate
with
us
when
you
speak
of
a
squatter
you
are
always
supposed
to
be
speaking
of
a
poor
man
but
in
australia
when
you
speak
of
a
squatter
you
are
supposed
to
be
speaking
of
a
millionaire
in
america
the
word
indicates
the
possessor
of
a
few
acres
and
a
doubtful
title
in
australia
it
indicates
a
man
whose
landfront
is
as
long
as
a
railroad
and
whose
title
has
been
perfected
in
one
way
or
another
in
america
the
word
indicates
a
man
who
owns
a
dozen
head
of
live
stock
in
australia
a
man
who
owns
anywhere
from
fifty
thousand
up
to
half
a
million
head
in
america
the
word
indicates
a
man
who
is
obscure
and
not
important
in
australia
a
man
who
is
prominent
and
of
the
first
importance
in
america
you
take
off
your
hat
to
no
squatter
in
australia
you
do
in
america
if
your
uncle
is
a
squatter
you
keep
it
dark
in
australia
you
advertise
it
in
america
if
your
friend
is
a
squatter
nothing
comes
of
it
but
with
a
squatter
for
your
friend
in
australia
you
may
sup
with
kings
if
there
are
any
around
in

it
takes
about
two
acres
and
a
half
of
pastureland
some
people
say
twice
as
many
to
support
a
sheep
and
when
the
squatter
has
half
a
million
sheep
his
private
domain
is
about
as
large
as
rhode
island
to
speak
in
general
terms
his
annual
wool
crop
may
be
worth
a
quarter
or
a
half
million
dollars
he
will
live
in
a
palace
in
melbourne
or
sydney
or
some
other
of
the
large
cities
and
make
occasional
trips
to
his
several
hundred
miles
away
in
the
great
plains
to
look
after
his
battalions
of
riders
and
shepherds
and
other
hands
he
has
a
commodious
dwelling
out
there
and
if
he
approve
of
you
he
will
invite
you
to
spend
a
week
in
it
and
will
make
you
at
home
and
comfortable
and
let
you
see
the
great
industry
in
all
its
details
and
feed
you
and
slake
you
and
smoke
you
with
the
best
that
money
can
buy
on
at
least
one
of
these
vast
estates
there
is
a
considerable
town
with
all
the
various
businesses
and
occupations
that
go
to
make
an
important
town
and
the
town
and
the
land
it
stands
upon
are
the
property
of
the
squatters
i
have
seen
that
town
and
it
is
not
unlikely
that
there
are
other
towns
in
australia
australia
supplies
the
world
not
only
with
fine
wool
but
with
mutton
also
the
modern
invention
of
cold
storage
and
its
application
in
ships
has
created
this
great
trade
in
sydney
i
visited
a
huge
establishment
where
they
kill
and
clean
and
solidly
freeze
a
thousand
sheep
a
day
for
shipment
to
england
the
australians
did
not
seem
to
me
to
differ
noticeably
from
americans
either
in
dress
carriage
ways
pronunciation
inflections
or
general
appearance
there
were
fleeting
and
subtle
suggestions
of
their
english
origin
but
these
were
not
pronounced
enough
as
a
rule
to
catch
attention
the
people
have
easy
and
cordial
manners
from
the
beginning
from
the
moment
that
the
introduction
is
completed
this
is
american
to
put
it
in
another
way
it
is
english
friendliness
with
the
english
shyness
and
left
out
now
and
then
but
this
is
rare
one
hears
such
words
as
piper
for
paper
lydy
for
lady
and
tyble
for
table
fall
from
lips
whence
one
would
not
expect
such
pronunciations
to
come
there
is
a
superstition
prevalent
in
sydney
that
this
pronunciation
is
an
australianism
but
people
who
have
been
home
as
the
native
reverently
and
lovingly
calls
england
know
better
it
is
costermonger
all
over
australasia
this
pronunciation
is
nearly
as
common
among
servants
as
it
is
in
london
among
the
uneducated
and
the
partially
educated
of
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
people
that
mislaid
is
rather
striking
when
a
person
gets
enough
of
it
into
a
short
sentence
to
enable
it
to
show
up
in
the
hotel
in
sydney
the
chambermaid
said
one
morning
the
tyble
is
set
and
here
is
the
piper
and
if
the
lydy
is
ready
tell
the
wyter
to
bring
up
the
breakfast
i
have
made
passing
mention
a
moment
ago
of
the
native
custom
of
speaking
of
england
as
home
it
was
always
pretty
to
hear
it
and
often
it
was
said
in
an
unconsciously
caressing
way
that
made
it
touching
in
a
way
which
transmuted
a
sentiment
into
an
embodiment
and
made
one
seem
to
see
australasia
as
a
young
girl
stroking
mother
england
old
gray
head
in
the
australasian
home
the
is
vivacious
and
unembarrassed
it
is
without
stiffness
or
restraint
this
does
not
remind
one
of
england
so
much
as
it
does
of
america
but
australasia
is
strictly
democratic
and
reserves
and
restraints
are
things
that
are
bred
by
differences
of
rank
english
and
colonial
audiences
are
phenomenally
alert
and
responsive
where
masses
of
people
are
gathered
together
in
england
caste
is
submerged
and
with
it
the
english
reserve
equality
exists
for
the
moment
and
every
individual
is
free
so
free
from
any
consciousness
of
fetters
indeed
that
the
englishman
habit
of
watching
himself
and
guarding
himself
against
any
injudicious
exposure
of
his
feelings
is
forgotten
and
falls
into
abeyance
and
to
such
a
degree
indeed
that
he
will
bravely
applaud
all
by
himself
if
he
wants
to
an
exhibition
of
daring
which
is
unusual
elsewhere
in
the
world
but
it
is
hard
to
move
a
new
english
acquaintance
when
he
is
by
himself
or
when
the
company
present
is
small
and
new
to
him
he
is
on
his
guard
then
and
his
natural
reserve
is
to
the
fore
this
has
given
him
the
false
reputation
of
being
without
humor
and
without
the
appreciation
of
humor
americans
are
not
englishmen
and
american
humor
is
not
english
humor
but
both
the
american
and
his
humor
had
their
origin
in
england
and
have
merely
undergone
changes
brought
about
by
changed
conditions
and
a
new
environment
about
the
best
humorous
speeches
i
have
yet
heard
were
a
couple
that
were
made
in
australia
at
club
suppers
one
of
them
by
an
englishman
the
other
by
an
australian
chapter
xii
there
are
those
who
scoff
at
the
schoolboy
calling
him
frivolous
and
shallow
yet
it
was
the
schoolboy
who
said
faith
is
believing
what
you
know
ai
so
wilson
new
calendar
in
sydney
i
had
a
large
dream
and
in
the
course
of
talk
i
told
it
to
a
missionary
from
india
who
was
on
his
way
to
visit
some
relatives
in
new
zealand
i
dreamed
that
the
visible
universe
is
the
physical
person
of
god
that
the
vast
worlds
that
we
see
twinkling
millions
of
miles
apart
in
the
fields
of
space
are
the
blood
corpuscles
in
his
veins
and
that
we
and
the
other
creatures
are
the
microbes
that
charge
with
multitudinous
life
the
corpuscles
the
missionary
considered
the
dream
awhile
then
said
it
is
not
surpassable
for
magnitude
since
its
metes
and
bounds
are
the
metes
and
bounds
of
the
universe
itself
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
almost
accounts
for
a
thing
which
is
otherwise
nearly
unaccountable
the
origin
of
the
sacred
legends
of
the
hindoos
perhaps
they
dream
them
and
then
honestly
believe
them
to
be
divine
revelations
of
fact
it
looks
like
that
for
the
legends
are
built
on
so
vast
a
scale
that
it
does
not
seem
reasonable
that
plodding
priests
would
happen
upon
such
colossal
fancies
when
awake
he
told
some
of
the
legends
and
said
that
they
were
implicitly
believed
by
all
classes
of
hindoos
including
those
of
high
social
position
and
intelligence
and
he
said
that
this
universal
credulity
was
a
great
hindrance
to
the
missionary
in
his
work
then
he
said
something
like
this
at
home
people
wonder
why
christianity
does
not
make
faster
progress
in
india
they
hear
that
the
indians
believe
easily
and
that
they
have
a
natural
trust
in
miracles
and
give
them
a
hospitable
reception
then
they
argue
like
this
since
the
indian
believes
easily
place
christianity
before
them
and
they
must
believe
confirm
its
truths
by
the
biblical
miracles
and
they
will
no
longer
doubt
the
natural
deduction
is
that
as
christianity
makes
but
indifferent
progress
in
india
the
fault
is
with
us
we
are
not
fortunate
in
presenting
the
doctrines
and
the
miracles
but
the
truth
is
we
are
not
by
any
means
so
well
equipped
as
they
think
we
have
not
the
easy
task
that
they
imagine
to
use
a
military
figure
we
are
sent
against
the
enemy
with
good
powder
in
our
guns
but
only
wads
for
bullets
that
is
to
say
our
miracles
are
not
effective
the
hindoos
do
not
care
for
them
they
have
more
extraordinary
ones
of
their
own
all
the
details
of
their
own
religion
are
proven
and
established
by
miracles
the
details
of
ours
must
be
proven
in
the
same
way
when
i
first
began
my
work
in
india
i
greatly
underestimated
the
difficulties
thus
put
upon
my
task
a
correction
was
not
long
in
coming
i
thought
as
our
friends
think
at
home
that
to
prepare
my
childlike
to
listen
with
favor
to
my
grave
message
i
only
needed
to
charm
the
way
to
it
with
wonders
marvels
miracles
with
full
confidence
i
told
the
wonders
performed
by
samson
the
strongest
man
that
had
ever
lived
for
so
i
called
him
at
first
i
saw
lively
anticipation
and
strong
interest
in
the
faces
of
my
people
but
as
i
moved
along
from
incident
to
incident
of
the
great
story
i
was
distressed
to
see
that
i
was
steadily
losing
the
sympathy
of
my
audience
i
could
not
understand
it
it
was
a
surprise
to
me
and
a
disappointment
before
i
was
through
the
fading
sympathy
had
paled
to
indifference
thence
to
the
end
the
indifference
remained
i
was
not
able
to
make
any
impression
upon
it
a
good
old
hindoo
gentleman
told
me
where
my
trouble
lay
he
said
hindoos
recognize
a
god
by
the
work
of
his
hands
we
accept
no
other
testimony
apparently
this
is
also
the
rule
with
you
christians
and
we
know
when
a
man
has
his
power
from
a
god
by
the
fact
that
he
does
things
which
he
could
not
do
as
a
man
with
the
mere
powers
of
a
man
plainly
this
is
the
christian
way
also
of
knowing
when
a
man
is
working
by
a
god
power
and
not
by
his
own
you
saw
that
there
was
a
supernatural
property
in
the
hair
of
samson
for
you
perceived
that
when
his
hair
was
gone
he
was
as
other
men
it
is
our
way
as
i
have
said
there
are
many
nations
in
the
world
and
each
group
of
nations
has
its
own
gods
and
will
pay
no
worship
to
the
gods
of
the
others
each
group
believes
its
own
gods
to
be
strongest
and
it
will
not
exchange
them
except
for
gods
that
shall
be
proven
to
be
their
superiors
in
power
man
is
but
a
weak
creature
and
needs
the
help
of
gods
he
can
not
do
without
it
shall
he
place
his
fate
in
the
hands
of
weak
gods
when
there
may
be
stronger
ones
to
be
found
that
would
be
foolish
no
if
he
hear
of
gods
that
are
stronger
than
his
own
he
should
not
turn
a
deaf
ear
for
it
is
not
a
light
matter
that
is
at
stake
how
then
shall
he
determine
which
gods
are
the
stronger
his
own
or
those
that
preside
over
the
concerns
of
other
nations
by
comparing
the
known
works
of
his
own
gods
with
the
works
of
those
others
there
is
no
other
way
now
when
we
make
this
comparison
we
are
not
drawn
towards
the
gods
of
any
other
nation
our
gods
are
shown
by
their
works
to
be
the
strongest
the
most
powerful
the
christians
have
but
few
gods
and
they
are
new
new
and
not
strong
as
it
seems
to
us
they
will
increase
in
number
it
is
true
for
this
has
happened
with
all
gods
but
that
time
is
far
away
many
ages
and
decades
of
ages
away
for
gods
multiply
slowly
as
is
meet
for
beings
to
whom
a
thousand
years
is
but
a
single
moment
our
own
gods
have
been
born
millions
of
years
apart
the
process
is
slow
the
gathering
of
strength
and
power
is
similarly
slow
in
the
slow
lapse
of
the
ages
the
steadily
accumulating
power
of
our
gods
has
at
last
become
prodigious
we
have
a
thousand
proofs
of
this
in
the
colossal
character
of
their
personal
acts
and
the
acts
of
ordinary
men
to
whom
they
have
given
supernatural
qualities
to
your
samson
was
given
supernatural
power
and
when
he
broke
the
withes
and
slew
the
thousands
with
the
jawbone
of
an
ass
and
carried
away
the
gate
of
the
city
upon
his
shoulders
you
were
amazed
and
also
awed
for
you
recognized
the
divine
source
of
his
strength
but
it
could
not
profit
to
place
these
things
before
your
hindoo
congregation
and
invite
their
wonder
for
they
would
compare
them
with
the
deed
done
by
hanuman
when
our
gods
infused
their
divine
strength
into
his
muscles
and
they
would
be
indifferent
to
them
as
you
saw
in
the
old
old
times
ages
and
ages
gone
by
when
our
god
rama
was
warring
with
the
demon
god
of
ceylon
rama
bethought
him
to
bridge
the
sea
and
connect
ceylon
with
india
so
that
his
armies
might
pass
easily
over
and
he
sent
his
general
hanuman
inspired
like
your
own
samson
with
divine
strength
to
bring
the
materials
for
the
bridge
in
two
days
hanuman
strode
fifteen
hundred
miles
to
the
himalayas
and
took
upon
his
shoulder
a
range
of
those
lofty
mountains
two
hundred
miles
long
and
started
with
it
toward
ceylon
it
was
in
the
night
and
as
he
passed
along
the
plain
the
people
of
govardhun
heard
the
thunder
of
his
tread
and
felt
the
earth
rocking
under
it
and
they
ran
out
and
there
with
their
snowy
summits
piled
to
heaven
they
saw
the
himalayas
passing
by
and
as
this
huge
continent
swept
along
overshadowing
the
earth
upon
its
slopes
they
discerned
the
twinkling
lights
of
a
thousand
sleeping
villages
and
it
was
as
if
the
constellations
were
filing
in
procession
through
the
sky
while
they
were
looking
hanuman
stumbled
and
a
small
ridge
of
red
sandstone
twenty
miles
long
was
jolted
loose
and
fell
half
of
its
length
has
wasted
away
in
the
course
of
the
ages
but
the
other
ten
miles
of
it
remain
in
the
plain
by
govardhun
to
this
day
as
proof
of
the
might
of
the
inspiration
of
our
gods
you
must
know
yourself
that
hanuman
could
not
have
carried
those
mountains
to
ceylon
except
by
the
strength
of
the
gods
you
know
that
it
was
not
done
by
his
own
strength
therefore
you
know
that
it
was
done
by
the
strength
of
the
gods
just
as
you
know
that
samson
carried
the
gates
by
the
divine
strength
and
not
by
his
own
i
think
you
must
concede
two
things
first
that
in
carrying
the
gates
of
the
city
upon
his
shoulders
samson
did
not
establish
the
superiority
of
his
gods
over
ours
secondly
that
his
feat
is
not
supported
by
any
but
verbal
evidence
while
hanuman
is
not
only
supported
by
verbal
evidence
but
this
evidence
is
confirmed
established
proven
by
visible
tangible
evidence
which
is
the
strongest
of
all
testimony
we
have
the
sandstone
ridge
and
while
it
remains
we
can
not
doubt
and
shall
not
have
you
the
gates

wilson
new

one
is
sure
to
be
struck
by
the
liberal
way
in
which
australasia
spends
money
upon
public
works
such
as
legislative
buildings
town
halls
hospitals
asylums
parks
and
botanical
gardens
i
should
say
that
where
minor
towns
in
america
spend
a
hundred
dollars
on
the
town
hall
and
on
public
parks
and
gardens
the
like
towns
in
australasia
spend
a
thousand
and
i
think
that
this
ratio
will
hold
good
in
the
matter
of
hospitals
also
i
have
seen
a
costly
and
and
architecturally
handsome
hospital
in
an
australian
village
of
fifteen
hundred
inhabitants
it
was
built
by
private
funds
furnished
by
the
villagers
and
the
neighboring
planters
and
its
running
expenses
were
drawn
from
the
same
sources
i
suppose
it
would
be
hard
to
match
this
in
any
country
this
village
was
about
to
close
a
contract
for
lighting
its
streets

i
was

widely

that

addition
there
are
the
zoological
gardens
the
and
the
great
where
the
international
matches
are
played
therefore
there
is
plenty
of
room
for
reposeful
lazying
and
lounging
and
for
exercise
too
for
such
as
like
that
kind
of
work
there
are
four
specialties
attainable
in
the
way
of
social
pleasure
if
you
enter
your
name
on
the
visitor
book
at
government
house
you
will
receive
an
invitation
to
the
next
ball
that
takes
place
there
if
nothing
can
be
proven
against
you
and
it
will
be
very
pleasant
for
you
will
see
everybody
except
the
governor
and
add
a
number
of
acquaintances
and
several
friends
to
your
list
the
governor
will
be
in
england
he
always
is
the
continent
has
four
or
five
governors
and
i
do
not
know
how
many
it
takes
to
govern
the
outlying
archipelago
but
anyway
you
will
not
see
them
when
they
are
appointed
they
come
out
from
england
and
get
inaugurated
and
give
a
ball
and
help
pray
for
rain
and
get
aboard
ship
and
go
back
home
and
so
the
has
to
do
all
the
work
i
was
in
australasia
three
months
and
a
half
and
saw
only
one
governor
the
others
were
at
home
the
australasian
governor
would
not
be
so
restless
perhaps
if
he
had
a
war
or
a
veto
or
something
like
that
to
call
for
his
but
he
has
there
is
any
war
and
there
is
any
veto
in
his
hands
and
so
there
is
really
little
or
nothing
doing
in
his
line
the
country
governs
itself
and
prefers
to
do
it
and
is
so
strenuous
about
it
and
so
jealous
of
its
independence
that
it
grows
restive
if
even
the
imperial
government
at
home
proposes
to
help
and
so
the
imperial
veto
while
a
fact
is
yet
mainly
a
name
thus
the
governor
functions
are
much
more
limited
than
are
a
functions
with
us
and
therefore
more
fatiguing
he
is
the
apparent
head
of
the
state
he
is
the
real
head
of
society
he
represents
culture
refinement
elevated
sentiment
polite
life
religion
and
by
his
example
he
propagates
these
and
they
spread
and
flourish
and
bear
good
fruit
he
creates
the
fashion
and
leads
it
his
ball
is
the
ball
of
balls
and
his
countenance
makes
the
thrive
he
is
usually
a
lord
and
this
is
well
for
his
position
compels
him
to
lead
an
expensive
life
and
an
english
lord
is
generally
well
equipped
for
that
another
of
sydney
social
pleasures
is
the
visit
to
the
admiralty
house
which
is
nobly
situated
on
high
ground
overlooking
the
water
the
trim
boats
of
the
service
convey
the
guests
thither
and
there
or
on
board
the
they
have
the
duplicate
of
the
hospitalities
of
government
house
the
admiral
commanding
a
station
in
british
waters
is
a
magnate
of
the
first
degree
and
he
is
sumptuously
housed
as
becomes
the
dignity
of
his
office
third
in
the
list
of
special
pleasures
is
the
tour
of
the
harbor
in
a
fine
steam
your
richer
friends
own
boats
of
this
kind
and
they
will
invite
you
and
the
joys
of
the
trip
will
make
a
long
day
seem
short
and
finally
comes
the
sydney
harbor
is
populous
with
the
finest
breeds
of
sharks
in
the
world
some
people
make
their
living
catching
them
for
the
government
pays
a
cash
bounty
on
them
the
larger
the
shark
the
larger
the
bounty
and
some
of
the
sharks
are
twenty
feet
long
you
not
only
get
the
bounty
but
everything
that
is
in
the
shark
belongs
to
you
sometimes
the
contents
are
quite
valuable
the
shark
is
the
swiftest
fish
that
swims
the
speed
of
the
fastest
steamer
afloat
is
poor
compared
to
his
and
he
is
a
great
and
roams
far
and
wide
in
the
oceans
and
visits
the
shores
of
all
of
them
ultimately
in
the
course
of
his
restless
excursions
i
have
a
tale
to
tell
now
which
has
not
as
yet
been
in
print
in
a
young
stranger
arrived
in
sydney
and
set
about
finding
something
to
do
but
he
knew
no
one
and
brought
no
recommendations
and
the
result
was
that
he
got
no
employment
he
had
aimed
high
at
first
but
as
time
and
his
money
wasted
away
he
grew
less
and
less
exacting
until
at
last
he
was
willing
to
serve
in
the
humblest
capacities
if
so
he
might
get
bread
and
shelter
but
luck
was
still
against
him
he
could
find
no
opening
of
any
sort
finally
his
money
was
all
gone
he
walked
the
streets
all
day
thinking
he
walked
them
all
night
thinking
thinking
and
growing
hungrier
and
hungrier
at
dawn
he
found
himself
well
away
from
the
town
and
drifting
aimlessly
along
the
harbor
shore
as
he
was
passing
by
a
nodding
the
man
looked
up
and
said
say
young
fellow
take
my
line
a
spell
and
change
my
luck
for
me
how
do
you
know
i
wo
make
it
worse
because
you
ca
it
has
been
at
its
worst
all
night
if
you
change
it
no
harm
done
if
you
do
change
it
it
for
the
better
of
course
come
all
right
what
will
you
give
i
give
you
the
shark
if
you
catch
one
and
i
will
eat
it
bones
and
all
give
me
the
line
here
you
are
i
will
get
away
now
for
awhile
so
that
my
luck
spoil
yours
for
many
and
many
a
time
i
noticed
that
if
there
pull
in
pull
in
man
you
got
a
bite
i
knew
how
it
would
be
why
i
knew
you
for
a
born
son
of
luck
the
minute
i
saw
you
all
right
landed
it
was
an
unusually
large
shark
a
full
the
fisherman
said
as
he
laid
the
creature
open
with
his
knife
now
you
rob
him
young
man
while
i
step
to
my
hamper
for
a
fresh
bait
there
generally
something
in
them
worth
going
for
you
changed
my
luck
you
see
but
my
goodness
i
hope
you
have
changed
your
own
oh
it
would
matter
do
worry
about
that
get
your
bait
rob
him
when
the
fisherman
got
back
the
young
man
had
just
finished
washing
his
hands
in
the
bay
and
was
starting
away
what
you
are
not
going
yes
but
what
about
your
shark
the
shark
why
what
use
is
he
to
me
what
use
is
he
i
like
that
do
you
know
that
we
can
go
and
report
him
to
government
and
you
get
a
clean
solid
eighty
shillings
bounty
hard
cash
you
know
what
do
you
think
about
it
now
oh
well
you
can
collect
it
and
keep
it
is
that
what
you
mean
yes
well
this
is
odd
you
one
of
those
sort
they
call
eccentrics
i
judge
the
saying
is
you
must
judge
a
man
by
his
clothes
and
believing
it
now
why
yours
are
looking
just
ratty
do
you
know
and
yet
you
must
be
rich
i
am
the
young
man
walked
slowly
back
to
the
town
deeply
musing
as
he
went
he
halted
a
moment
in
front
of
the
best
restaurant
then
glanced
at
his
clothes
and
passed
on
and
got
his
breakfast
at
a
there
was
a
good
deal
of
it
and
it
cost
five
shillings
he
tendered
a
sovereign
got
his
change
glanced
at
his
silver
muttered
to
himself
there
enough
to
buy
clothes
with
and
went
his
way
at
nine
the
richest
in
sydney
was
sitting
in
his
at
home
settling
his
breakfast
with
the
morning
paper
a
servant
put
his
head

and
said

up
the
sundowner
was
shown
in
the
broker
said
to
himself
no
he
not
crazy
that
is
easy
to
see
so
he
must
be
the
other
thing
then
aloud
well
my
good
fellow
be
quick
about
it
do
waste
any
words
what
is
it
you
want
i
want
to
borrow
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
scott
it
a
mistake
he
is
crazy
no
he
ca
be
not
with
that
eye
why
you
take
my
breath
away
come
who
are
you
nobody
that
you
know
what
is
your
name
cecil
rhodes
no
i
do
remember
hearing
the
name
before
now
then
just
for
curiosity
sake
what
has
sent
you
to
me
on
this
extraordinary
errand
the
intention
to
make
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
for
you
and
as
much
for
myself
within
the
next
sixty
days
well
well
well
it
is
the
most
extraordinary
idea
that
sit
down
you
interest
me
and
somehow
you
well
you
fascinate
me
i
think
that
that
is
about
the
word
and
it
is
your
proposition
no
that
fascinate
me
it
something
else
i
do
quite
know
what
something
that
born
in
you
and
oozes
out
of
you
i
suppose
now
then
just
for
curiosity
sake
again
nothing
more
as
i
understand
it
it
is
your
desire
to
bor
i
said
intention
pardon
so
you
did
i
thought
it
was
an
unheedful
use
of
the
word
an
unheedful
valuing
of
its
strength
you
know
i
knew
its
strength
well
i
must
say
but
look
here
let
me
walk
the
floor
a
little
my
mind
is
getting
into
a
sort
of
whirl
though
you
do
seem
disturbed
any
plainly
this
young
fellow
is
crazy
but
as
to
his
being
remarkable
well
really
he
amounts
to
that
and
something
over
now
then
i
believe
i
am
beyond
the
reach
of
further
astonishment
strike
and
spare
not
what
is
your
scheme
to
buy
the
wool
crop
deliverable
in
sixty
days
what
the
whole
of
it
the
whole
of
it
no
i
was
not
quite
out
of
the
reach
of
surprises
after
all
why
how
you
talk
do
you
know
what
our
crop
is
going
to
foot
up
two
and
a
half
million
sterling
maybe
a
little
more
well
you
got
your
statistics
right
any
way
now
then
do
you
know
what
the
margins
would
foot
up
to
buy
it
at
sixty
days
the
hundred
thousand
pounds
i
came
here
to
get
right
once
more
well
dear
me
just
to
see
what
would
happen
i
wish
you
had
the
money
and
if
you
had
it
what
would
you
do
with
it
i
shall
make
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
out
of
it
in
sixty
days
you
mean
of
course
that
you
might
make
it
if
i
said
yes
by
george
you
did
say
you
are
the
most
definite
devil
i
ever
saw
in
the
matter
of
language
dear
dear
dear
look
here
definite
speech
means
clarity
of
mind
upon
my
word
i
believe
you
got
what
you
believe
to
be
a
rational
reason
for
venturing
into
this
house
an
entire
stranger
on
this
wild
scheme
of
buying
the
wool
crop
of
an
entire
colony
on
speculation
bring
it
out
i
am
prepared
acclimatized
if
i
may
use
the
word
why
would
you
buy
the
crop
and
why
would
you
make
that
sum
out
of
it
that
is
to
say
what
makes
you
think
you
i
do
think
i
know
definite
again
how
do
you
know
because
france
has
declared
war
against
germany
and
wool
has
gone
up
fourteen
per
cent
in
london
and
is
still
rising
oh
now
then
i
got
you
such
a
thunderbolt
as
you
have
just
let
fly
ought
to
have
made
me
jump
out
of
my
chair
but
it
stir
me
the
least
little
bit
you
see
and
for
a
very
simple
reason
i
have
read
the
morning
paper
you
can
look
at
it
if
you
want
to
the
fastest
ship
in
the
service
arrived
at
eleven
last
night
fifty
days
out
from
london
all
her
news
is
printed
here
there
are
no
anywhere
and
as
for
wool
why
it
is
the
commodity
in
the
english
market
it
is
your
turn
to
jump
now
well
why
do
you
jump
why
do
you
sit
there
in
that
placid
fashion
when
because
i
have
later
news
later
news
oh
come
later
news
than
fifty
days
brought
steaming
hot
from
london
by
the
my
news
is
only
ten
days
old
oh
hear
the
maniac
talk
where
did
you
get
it
got
it
out
of
a
shark
oh
oh
oh
this
is
too
much
front
call
the
police
bring
the
gun
raise
the
town
all
the
asylums
in
christendom
have
broken
loose
in
the
single
person
of
sit
down
and
collect
yourself
where
is
the
use
in
getting
excited
am
i
excited
there
is
nothing
to
get
excited
about
when
i
make
a
statement
which
i
can
not
prove
it
will
be
time
enough
for
you
to
begin
to
offer
hospitality
to
damaging
fancies
about
me
and
my
sanity
oh
a
thousand
thousand
pardons
i
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
myself
and
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
for
thinking
that
a
little
bit
of
a
circumstance
like
sending
a
shark
to
england
to
fetch
back
a
market
report
what
does
your
middle
initial
stand
for
sir
andrew
what
are
you
writing
wait
a
moment
proof
about
the
shark
and
another
matter
only
ten
lines
there
now
it
is
done
sign
it
many
thanks
many
let
me
see
it
says
it
says
oh
come
this
is
interesting
why
why
look
here
prove
what
you
say
here
and
i
put
up
the
money
and
double
as
much
if
necessary
and
divide
the
winnings
with
you
half
and
half
there
now
i
signed
make
your
promise
good
if
you
can
show
me
a
copy
of
the
london
times
only
ten
days
old
here
it
is
and
with
it
these
buttons
and
a
memorandum
book
that
belonged
to
the
man
the
shark
swallowed
swallowed
him
in
the
thames
without
a
doubt
for
you
will
notice
that
the
last
entry
in
the
book
is
dated
and
is
of
the
same
date
as
the
times
and
says
confequentz
der
kreigeseflarun
reife
ich
heute
nach
deutchland
ab
aur
bak
ich
mein
leben
auf
dem
ultar
meines
landes
legen
mag
as
clean
native
german
as
anybody
can
put
upon
paper
and
means
that
in
consequence
of
the
declaration
of
war
this
loyal
soul
is
leaving
for
home
to
fight
and
he
did
leave
too
but
the
shark
had
him
before
the
day
was
done
poor
fellow
and
a
pity
too
but
there
are
times
for
mourning
and
we
will
attend
to
this
case
further
on
other
matters
are
pressing
now
i
will
go
down
and
set
the
machinery
in
motion
in
a
quiet
way
and
buy
the
crop
it
will
cheer
the
drooping
spirits
of
the
boys
in
a
transitory
way
everything
is
transitory
in
this
world
sixty
days
hence
when
they
are
called
to
deliver
the
goods
they
will
think
they
been
struck
by
lightning
but
there
is
a
time
for
mourning
and
we
will
attend
to
that
case
along
with
the
other
one
come
along
i
take
you
to
my
tailor
what
did
you
say
your
name
is
cecil
rhodes
it
is
hard
to
remember
however
i
think
you
will
make
it
easier
by
and
by
if
you
live
there
are
three
kinds
of
people
commonplace
men
remarkable
men
and
lunatics
i
classify
you
with
the
remarkables
and
take
the
chances
the
deal
went
through
and
secured
to
the
young
stranger
the
first
fortune
he
ever
pocketed
the
people
of
sydney
ought
to
be
afraid
of
the
sharks
but
for
some
reason
they
do
not
seem
to
be
on
saturdays
the
young
men
go
out
in
their
boats
and
sometimes
the
water
is
fairly
covered
with
the
little
sails
a
boat
upsets
now
and
then
by
accident
a
result
of
tumultuous
skylarking
sometimes
the
boys
upset
their
boat
for
fun
such
as
it
is
with
sharks
visibly
waiting
around
for
just
such
an
occurrence
the
young
fellows
scramble
aboard
whole
sometimes
not
always
tragedies
have
happened
more
than
once
while
i
was
in
sydney
it
was
reported
that
a
boy
fell
out
of
a
boat
in
the
mouth
of
the
paramatta
river
and
screamed
for
help
and
a
boy
jumped
overboard
from
another
boat
to
save
him
from
the
assembling
sharks
but
the
sharks
made
swift
work
with
the
lives
of
both
the
government
pays
a
bounty
for
the
shark
to
get
the
bounty
the
fishermen
bait
the
hook
or
the
seine
with
agreeable
mutton
the
news
spreads
and
the
sharks
come
from
all
over
the
pacific
ocean
to
get
the
free
board
in
time
the
shark
culture
will
be
one
of
the
most
successful
things
in
the
colony
chapter
xiv
we
can
secure
other
people
approval
if
we
do
right
and
try
hard
but
our
own
is
worth
a
hundred
of
it
and
no
way
has
been
found
out
of
securing
that
wilson
new
calendar
my
health
had
broken
down
in
new
york
in
may
it
had
remained
in
a
doubtful
but
fairish
condition
during
a
succeeding
period
of
days
it
broke
again
on
the
pacific
it
broke
again
in
sydney
but
not
until
after
i
had
had
a
good
outing
and
had
also
filled
my
lecture
engagements
this
latest
break
lost
me
the
chance
of
seeing
queensland
in
the
circumstances
to
go
north
toward
hotter
weather
was
not
advisable
so
we
moved
south
with
a
westward
slant
hours
by
rail
to
the
capital
of
the
colony
of
victoria
melbourne
that
juvenile
city
of
sixty
years
and
half
a
million
inhabitants
on
the
map
the
distance
looked
small
but
that
is
a
trouble
with
all
divisions
of
distance
in
such
a
vast
country
as
australia
the
colony
of
victoria
itself
looks
small
on
the
map
looks
like
a
county
in
fact
yet
it
is
about
as
large
as
england
scotland
and
wales
combined
or
to
get
another
focus
upon
it
it
is
just
times
as
large
as
the
state
of
rhode
island
and
as
large
as
the
state
of
texas
outside
of
melbourne
victoria
seems
to
be
owned
by
a
handful
of
squatters
each
with
a
rhode
island
for
a
sheep
farm
that
is
the
impression
which
one
gathers
from
common
talk
yet
the
wool
industry
of
victoria
is
by
no
means
so
great
as
that
of
new
south
wales
the
climate
of
victoria
is
favorable
to
other
great
industries
among
others
and
the
making
of
wine
we
took
the
train
at
sydney
at
about
four
in
the
afternoon
it
was
american
in
one
way
for
we
had
a
most
rational
sleeping
car
also
the
car
was
clean
and
fine
and
new
nothing
about
it
to
suggest
the
rolling
stock
of
the
continent
of
europe
but
our
baggage
was
weighed
and
extra
weight
charged
for
that
was
continental
continental
and
troublesome
any
detail
of
railroading
that
is
not
troublesome
can
not
honorably
be
described
as
continental
the
tickets
were
ones
to
melbourne
and
clear
to
adelaide
in
south
australia
and
then
all
the
way
back
to
sydney
twelve
hundred
more
miles
than
we
really
expected
to
make
but
then
as
the
round
trip
would
cost
much
more
than
the
single
trip
it
seemed
well
enough
to
buy
as
many
miles
as
one
could
afford
even
if
one
was
not
likely
to
need
them
a
human
being
has
a
natural
desire
to
have
more
of
a
good
thing
than
he
needs
now
comes
a
singular
thing
the
oddest
thing
the
strangest
thing
the
most
baffling
and
unaccountable
marvel
that
australasia
can
show
at
the
frontier
between
new
south
wales
and
victoria
our
multitude
of
passengers
were
routed
out
of
their
snug
beds
by
in
the
morning
in
the
of
a
high
altitude
to
change
cars
on
a
road
that
has
no
break
in
it
from
sydney
to
melbourne
think
of
the
paralysis
of
intellect
that
gave
that
idea
birth
imagine
the
boulder
it
emerged
from
on
some
petrified
legislator
shoulders
it
is
a
road
to
the
frontier
and
a
broader
gauge
thence
to
melbourne
the
two
governments
were
the
builders
of
the
road
and
are
the
owners
of
it
one
or
two
reasons
are
given
for
this
curious
state
of
things
one
is
that
it
represents
the
jealousy
existing
between
the
colonies
the
two
most
important
colonies
of
australasia
what
the
other
one
is
i
have
forgotten
but
it
is
of
no
consequence
it
could
be
but
another
effort
to
explain
the
inexplicable
all
passengers
fret
at
the
all
shippers
of
freight
must
of
course
fret
at
it
unnecessary
expense
delay
and
annoyance
are
imposed
upon
everybody
concerned
and
no
one
is
benefitted
each
australian
colony
fences
itself
off
from
its
neighbor
with
a
personally
i
have
no
objection
but
it
must
be
a
good
deal
of
inconvenience
to
the
people
we
have
something
resembling
it
here
and
there
in
america
but
it
goes
by
another
name
the
large
empire
of
the
pacific
coast
requires
a
world
of
iron
machinery
and
could
manufacture
it
economically
on
the
spot
if
the
imposts
on
foreign
iron
were
removed
but
they
are
not
protection
to
pennsylvania
and
alabama
forbids
it
the
result
to
the
pacific
coast
is
the
same
as
if
there
were
several
rows
of
between
the
coast
and
the
east
iron
carted
across
the
american
continent
at
luxurious
railway
rates
would
be
valuable
enough
to
be
coined
when
it
arrived
we
changed
cars
this
was
at
albury
and
it
was
there
i
think
that
the
growing
day
and
the
early
sun
exposed
the
distant
range
called
the
blue
mountains
accurately
named
my
word
as
the
australians
say
but
it
was
a
stunning
color
that
blue
deep
strong
rich
exquisite
towering
and
majestic
masses
of
blue
a
softly
luminous
blue
a
smouldering
blue
as
if
vaguely
lit
by
fires
within
it
extinguished
the
blue
of
the
sky
made
it
pallid
and
unwholesome
whitey
and
a
wonderful
color
just
divine
a
resident
told
me
that
those
were
not
mountains
he
said
they
were
and
explained
that
long
exposure
and
the
condition
of
the
rabbits
was
what
made
them
look
so
blue
this
man
may
have
been
right
but
much
reading
of
books
of
travel
has
made
me
distrustful
of
gratis
information
furnished
by
unofficial
residents
of
a
country
the
facts
which
such
people
give
to
travelers
are
usually
erroneous
and
often
intemperately
so
the
has
indeed
been
very
bad
in
australia
and
it
could
account
for
one
mountain
but
not
for
a
mountain
range
it
seems
to
me
it
is
too
large
an
order
we
breakfasted
at
the
station
a
good
breakfast
except
the
coffee
and
cheap
the
government
establishes
the
prices
and
placards
them
the
waiters
were
men
i
think
but
that
is
not
usual
in
australasia
the
usual
thing
is
to
have
girls
no
not
girls
young
ladies
generally
duchesses
dress
they
would
attract
attention
at
any
royal
levee
in
europe
even
empresses
and
queens
do
not
dress
as
they
do
not
that
they
could
not
afford
it
perhaps
but
they
would
not
know
how
all
the
pleasant
morning
we
slid
smoothly
along
over
the
plains
through
thin
not
thick
forests
of
great
melancholy
gum
trees
with
trunks
rugged
with
curled
sheets
of
flaking
bark
erysipelas
convalescents
so
to
speak
shedding
their
dead
skins
and
all
along
were
tiny
cabins
built
sometimes
of
wood
sometimes
of
corrugated
iron
and
the
doorsteps
and
fences
were
clogged
with
children
rugged
little
chaps
that
looked
as
if
they
had
been
imported
from
the
banks
of
the
mississippi
without
breaking
bulk
and
there
were
little
villages
with
neat
stations
well
placarded
with
showy
advertisements
mainly
of
almost
too
brands
of
sheepdip
if
that
is
the
name
and
i
think
it
is
it
is
a
stuff
like
tar
and
is
dabbed
on
to
places
where
the
shearer
clips
a
piece
out
of
the
sheep
it
bars
out
the
flies
and
has
healing
properties
and
a
nip
to
it
which
makes
the
sheep
skip
like
the
cattle
on
a
thousand
hills
it
is
not
good
to
eat
that
is
it
is
not
good
to
eat
except
when
mixed
with
railroad
coffee
it
improves
railroad
coffee
without
it
railroad
coffee
is
too
vague
but
with
it
it
is
quite
assertive
and
enthusiastic
by
itself
railroad
coffee
is
too
passive
but
makes
it
wake
up
and
get
down
to
business
i
wonder
where
they
get
railroad
coffee
we
saw
birds
but
not
a
kangaroo
not
an
emu
not
an
ornithorhynchus
not
a
lecturer
not
a
native
indeed
the
land
seemed
quite
destitute
of
game
but
i
have
misused
the
word
native
in
australia
it
is
applied
to
whites
only
i
should
have
said
that
we
saw
no
aboriginals
no
blackfellows
and
to
this
day
i
have
never
seen
one
in
the
great
museums
you
will
find
all
the
other
curiosities
but
in
the
curio
of
chiefest
interest
to
the
stranger
all
of
them
are
lacking
we
have
at
home
an
abundance
of
museums
and
not
an
american
indian
in
them
it
is
clearly
an
absurdity
but
it
never
struck
me
before
chapter
xv
truth
is
stranger
than
fiction
to
some
people
but
i
am
measurably
familiar
with
it
wilson
new
calendar
truth
is
stranger
than
fiction
but
it
is
because
fiction
is
obliged
to
stick
to
possibilities
truth
is
wilson
new
calendar
the
air
was
balmy
and
delicious
the
sunshine
radiant
it
was
a
charming
excursion
in
the
course
of
it
we
came
to
a
town
whose
odd
name
was
famous
all
over
the
world
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
this
was
because
the
tichborne
claimant
had
kept
a
there
it
was
out
of
the
midst
of
his
humble
collection
of
sausages
and
tripe
that
he
soared
up
into
the
zenith
of
notoriety
and
hung
there
in
the
wastes
of
space
a
time
with
the
telescopes
of
all
nations
leveled
at
him
in
unappeasable
curiosity
curiosity
as
to
which
of
the
two
persons
he
was
arthur
orton
the
mislaid
roustabout
of
wapping
or
sir
roger
tichborne
the
lost
heir
of
a
name
and
estates
as
old
as
english
history
we
all
know
now
but
not
a
dozen
people
knew
then
and
the
dozen
kept
the
mystery
to
themselves
and
allowed
the
most
intricate
and
fascinating
and
marvelous
romance
that
has
ever
been
played
upon
the
world
stage
to
unfold
itself
serenely
act
by
act
in
a
british
court
by
the
long
and
laborious
processes
of
judicial
development
when
we
recall
the
details
of
that
great
romance
we
marvel
to
see
what
daring
chances
truth
may
freely
take
in
constructing
a
tale
as
compared
with
the
poor
little
conservative
risks
permitted
to
fiction
the
could
achieve
no
success
with
the
materials
of
this
splendid
tichborne
romance
he
would
have
to
drop
out
the
chief
characters
the
public
would
say
such
people
are
impossible
he
would
have
to
drop
out
a
number
of
the
most
picturesque
incidents
the
public
would
say
such
things
could
never
happen
and
yet
the
chief
characters
did
exist
and
the
incidents
did
happen
it
cost
the
tichborne
estates
to
unmask
the
claimant
and
drive
him
out
and
even
after
the
exposure
multitudes
of
englishmen
still
believed
in
him
it
cost
the
british
government
another
to
convict
him
of
perjury
and
after
the
conviction
the
same
old
multitudes
still
believed
in
him
and
among
these
believers
were
many
educated
and
intelligent
men
and
some
of
them
had
personally
known
the
real
sir
roger
the
claimant
was
sentenced
to
years
imprisonment
when
he
got
out
of
prison
he
went
to
new
york
and
kept
a
whisky
saloon
in
the
bowery
for
a
time
then
disappeared
from
view
he
always
claimed
to
be
sir
roger
tichborne
until
death
called
for
him
this
was
but
a
few
months
ago
not
very
much
short
of
a
generation
since
he
left
to
go
and
possess
himself
of
his
estates
on
his
he
yielded
up
his
secret
and
confessed
in
writing
that
he
was
only
arthur
orton
of
wapping
able
seaman
and
butcher
that
and
nothing
more
but
it
is
scarcely
to
be
doubted
that
there
are
people
whom
even
his
dying
confession
will
not
convince
the
old
habit
of
assimilating
incredibilities
must
have
made
strong
food
a
necessity
in
their
case
a
weaker
article
would
probably
disagree
with
them
i
was
in
london
when
the
claimant
stood
his
trial
for
perjury
i
attended
one
of
his
showy
evenings
in
the
sumptuous
quarters
provided
for
him
from
the
purses
of
his
adherents
and
he
was
in
evening
dress
and
i
thought
him
a
rather
fine
and
stately
creature
there
were
about
gentlemen
present
educated
men
men
moving
in
good
society
none
of
them
commonplace
some
of
them
were
men
of
distinction
none
of
them
were
obscurities
they
were
his
cordial
friends
and
admirers
it
was
sir
roger
always
sir
roger
on
all
hands
no
one
withheld
the
title
all
turned
it
from
the
tongue
with
unction
and
as
if
it
tasted
good
for
many
years
i
had
had
a
mystery
in
stock
melbourne
and
only
melbourne
could
unriddle
it
for
me
in
i
arrived
in
london
with
my
wife
and
young
child
and
presently
received
a
note
from
naples
signed
by
a
name
not
familiar
to
me
it
was
not
bascom
and
it
was
not
henry
but
i
will
call
it
henry
bascom
for
convenience
sake
this
note
of
about
six
lines
was
written
on
a
strip
of
white
paper
whose
were
ragged
i
came
to
be
familiar
with
those
strips
in
later
years
their
size
and
pattern
were
always
the
same
their
contents
were
usually
to
the
same
effect
would
i
and
mine
come
to
the
writer
in
england
on
such
and
such
a
date
by
such
and
such
a
train
and
stay
twelve
days
and
depart
by
such
and
such
a
train
at
the
end
of
the
specified
time
a
carriage
would
meet
us
at
the
station
these
invitations
were
always
for
a
long
time
ahead
if
we
were
in
europe
three
months
ahead
if
we
were
in
america
six
to
twelve
months
ahead
they
always
named
the
exact
date
and
train
for
the
beginning
and
also
for
the
end
of
the
visit
this
first
note
invited
us
for
a
date
three
months
in
the
future
it
asked
us
to
arrive
by
the
train
from
london
august
the
carriage
would
be
waiting
the
carriage
would
take
us
away
seven
days
specified
and
there
were
these
words
speak
to
tom
hughes
i
showed
the
note
to
the
author
of
tom
brown
at
rugby
and
be
said
accept
and
be
thankful
he
described
bascom
as
being
a
man
of
genius
a
man
of
fine
attainments
a
choice
man
in
every
way
a
rare
and
beautiful
character
he
said
that
bascom
hall
was
a
particularly
fine
example
of
the
stately
manorial
mansion
of
elizabeth
days
and
that
it
was
a
house
worth
going
a
long
way
to
see
like
knowle
that
was
of
a
social
disposition
liked
the
company
of
agreeable
people
and
always
had
samples
of
the
sort
coming
and
going
we
paid
the
visit
we
paid
others
in
later
years
the
last
one
in
soon
after
that
bascom
started
on
a
voyage
around
the
world
in
a
steam
yacht
a
long
and
leisurely
trip
for
he
was
making
collections
in
all
lands
of
birds
butterflies
and
such
things
the
day
that
president
garfield
was
shot
by
the
assassin
guiteau
we
were
at
a
little
watering
place
on
long
island
sound
and
in
the
mail
matter
of
that
day
came
a
letter
with
the
melbourne
on
it
it
was
for
my
wife
but
i
recognized
bascom
handwriting
on
the
envelope
and
opened
it
it
was
the
usual
note
as
to
paucity
of
lines
and
was
written
on
the
customary
strip
of
paper
but
there
was
nothing
usual
about
the
contents
the
note
informed
my
wife
that
if
it
would
be
any
assuagement
of
her
grief
to
know
that
her
husband
in
australia
was
a
satisfactory
venture
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
he
the
writer
could
testify
that
such
was
the
case
also
that
her
husband
untimely
death
had
been
mourned
by
all
classes
as
she
would
already
know
by
the
press
telegrams
long
before
the
reception
of
this
note
that
the
funeral
was
attended
by
the
officials
of
the
colonial
and
city
governments
and
that
while
he
the
writer
her
friend
and
mine
had
not
reached
melbourne
in
time
to
see
the
body
he
had
at
least
had
the
sad
privilege
of
acting
as
one
of
the
signed
henry
bascom
my
first
thought
was
why
did
he
have
the
coffin
opened
he
would
have
seen
that
the
corpse
was
an
imposter
and
he
could
have
gone
right
ahead
and
dried
up
the
most
of
those
tears
and
comforted
those
sorrowing
governments
and
sold
the
remains
and
sent
me
the
money
i
did
nothing
about
the
matter
i
had
set
the
law
after
living
lecture
doubles
of
mine
a
couple
of
times
in
america
and
the
law
had
not
been
able
to
catch
them
others
in
my
trade
had
tried
to
catch
their
and
had
failed
then
where
was
the
use
in
harrying
a
ghost
none
and
so
i
did
not
disturb
it
i
had
a
curiosity
to
know
about
that
man
and
last
moments
but
that
could
wait
when
i
should
see
bascom
he
would
tell
me
all
about
it
but
he
passed
from
life
and
i
never
saw
him
my
curiosity
faded
away
however
when
i
found
that
i
was
going
to
australia
it
revived
and
naturally
for
if
the
people
should
say
that
i
was
a
dull
poor
thing
compared
to
what
i
was
before
i
died
it
would
have
a
bad
effect
on
business
well
to
my
surprise
the
sydney
journalists
had
never
heard
of
that
impostor
i
pressed
them
but
they
were
firm
they
had
never
heard
of
him
and
did
believe
in
him
i
could
not
understand
it
still
i
thought
it
would
all
come
right
in
melbourne
the
government
would
remember
and
the
other
mourners
at
the
supper
of
the
institute
of
journalists
i
should
find
out
all
about
the
matter
but
no
it
turned
out
that
they
had
never
heard
of
it
so
my
mystery
was
a
mystery
still
it
was
a
great
disappointment
i
believed
it
would
never
be
cleared
up
in
this
life
so
i
dropped
it
out
of
my
mind
but
at
last
just
when
i
was
least
expecting
it
however
this
is
not
the
place
for
the
rest
of
it
i
shall
come
to
the
matter
again

a
chapter

spreads
around
over

it

architecturally
as

it
has

it

the

with
honor
and
credit
it
has
one
specialty
this
must
not
be
jumbled
in
with
those
other
things
it
is
the
mitred

of
the
cult
its
is
the
mecca
of
australasia
on
the
great
annual
day
of

the

guy
fawkes
day
business
is
suspended
over
a
stretch
of
land
and
sea
as
wide
as
from
new
york
to
san
francisco
and
deeper
than
from
the
northern

to
the

of

and
every
man
and
woman
of
high
degree
or
low
who
can
afford
the
expense
put
away
their
other
duties
and
come
they
begin
to
swarm
in
by
ship
and
rail
a
fortnight
before
the
day
and
they
swarm
thicker
and
thicker
day
after
day
until
all
the
vehicles
of
transportation
are
taxed
to
their
uttermost
to
meet
the
demands
of
the
occasion
and
all
hotels
and
lodgings
are
bulging
outward
because
of
the
pressure
from
within
they
come
a
hundred
thousand
strong
as
all
the
best
authorities
say
and
they
pack
the
spacious
grounds
and
grandstands
and
make
a
spectacle
such
as
is
never
to
be
seen
in
australasia
elsewhere
it
is
the
melbourne
cup
that
brings
this
multitude
together
their
clothes
have
been
ordered
long
ago
at
unlimited
cost
and
without
bounds
as
to
beauty
and
magnificence
and
have
been
kept
in
concealment
until
now
for
unto
this
day
are
they
consecrate
i
am
speaking
of
the
clothes
but
one
might
know
that
and
so
the
make
a
brilliant
and
wonderful
spectacle
a
delirium
of
color
a
vision
of
beauty
the
champagne
flows
everybody
is
vivacious
excited
happy
everybody
bets
and
gloves
and
fortunes
change
hands
right
along
all
the
time
day
after
day
the
races
go
on
and
the
fun
and
the
excitement
are
kept
at
white
heat
and
when
each
day
is
done
the
people
dance
all
night
so
as
to
be
fresh
for
the
race
in
the
morning
and
at
the
end
of
the
great
week
the
swarms
secure
lodgings
and
transportation
for
next
year
then
flock
away
to
their
remote
homes
and
count
their
gains
and
losses
and
order
next
year
and
then
lie
down
and
sleep
two
weeks
and
get
up
sorry
to
reflect
that
a
whole
year
must
be
put
in
somehow
or
other
before
they
can
be
wholly
happy
again
the
melbourne
cup
is
the
australasian
national
day
it
would
be
difficult
to
overstate
its
importance
it
overshadows
all
other
holidays
and
specialized
days
of
whatever
sort
in
that
congeries
of
colonies
overshadows
them
i
might
almost
say
it
blots
them
out
each
of
them
gets
attention
but
not
everybody
each
of
them
evokes
interest
but
not
everybody
each
of
them
rouses
enthusiasm
but
not
everybody
in
each
case
a
part
of
the
attention
interest
and
enthusiasm
is
a
matter
of
habit
and
custom
and
another
part
of
it
is
official
and
perfunctory
cup
day
and
cup
day
only
commands
an
attention
an
interest
and
an
enthusiasm
which
are
universal
and
spontaneous
not
perfunctory
cup
day
is
supreme
it
has
no
rival
i
can
call
to
mind
no
specialized
annual
day
in
any
country
which
can
be
named
by
that
large
name
supreme
i
can
call
to
mind
no
specialized
annual
day
in
any
country
whose
approach
fires
the
whole
land
with
a
conflagration
of
conversation
and
preparation
and
anticipation
and
jubilation
no
day
save
this
one
but
this
one
does
it
in
america
we
have
no
annual
supreme
day
no
day
whose
approach
makes
the
whole
nation
glad
we
have
the
fourth
of
july
and
christmas
and
thanksgiving
neither
of
them
can
claim
the
primacy
neither
of
them
can
arouse
an
enthusiasm
which
comes
near
to
being
universal
eight
grown
americans
out
of
ten
dread
the
coming
of
the
fourth
with
its
pandemonium
and
its
perils
and
they
rejoice
when
it
is
gone
if
still
alive
the
approach
of
christmas
brings
harassment
and
dread
to
many
excellent
people
they
have
to
buy
a
of
presents
and
they
never
know
what
to
buy
to
hit
the
various
tastes
they
put
in
three
weeks
of
hard
and
anxious
work
and
when
christmas
morning
comes
they
are
so
dissatisfied
with
the
result
and
so
disappointed
that
they
want
to
sit
down
and
cry
then
they
give
thanks
that
christmas
comes
but
once
a
year
the
observance
of
thanksgiving
day
as
a
function
has
become
general
of
late
years
the
thankfulness
is
not
so
general
this
is
natural
of
the
nation
have
always
had
hard
luck
and
a
hard
time
during
the
year
and
this
has
a
calming
effect
upon
their
enthusiasm
we
have
a
supreme
day
a
sweeping
and
tremendous
and
tumultuous
day
a
day
which
commands
an
absolute
universality
of
interest
and
excitement
but
it
is
not
annual
it
comes
but
once
in
four
years
therefore
it
can
not
count
as
a
rival
of
the
melbourne
cup
in
great
britain
and
ireland
they
have
two
great
days
christmas
and
the
queen
birthday
but
they
are
equally
popular
there
is
no
supremacy
i
think
it
must
be
conceded
that
the
position
of
the
australasian
day
is
unique
solitary
unfellowed
and
likely
to
hold
that
high
place
a
long
time
the
next
things
which
interest
us
when
we
travel
are
first
the
people
next
the
novelties
and
finally
the
history
of
the
places
and
countries
visited
novelties
are
rare
in
cities
which
represent
the
most
advanced
civilization
of
the
modern
day
when
one
is
familiar
with
such
cities
in
the
other
parts
of
the
world
he
is
in
effect
familiar
with
the
cities
of
australasia
the
outside
aspects
will
furnish
little
that
is
new
there
will
be
new
names
but
the
things
which
they
represent
will
sometimes
be
found
to
be
less
new
than
their
names
there
may
be
shades
of
difference
but
these
can
easily
be
too
fine
for
detection
by
the
incompetent
eye
of
the
passing
stranger
in
the
larrikin
he
will
not
be
able
to
discover
a
new
species
but
only
an
old
one
met
elsewhere
and
variously
called
loafer
rough
tough
bummer
or
blatherskite
according
to
his
geographical
distribution
the
larrikin
differs
by
a
shade
from
those
others
in
that
he
is
more
sociable
toward
the
stranger
than
they
more
kindly
disposed
more
hospitable
more
hearty
more
friendly
at
least
it
seemed
so
to
me
and
i
had
opportunity
to
observe
in
sydney
at
least
in
melbourne
i
had
to
drive
to
and
from
the
but
in
sydney
i
was
able
to
walk
both
ways
and
did
it
every
night
on
my
way
home
at
ten
or
a
quarter
past
i
found
the
larrikin
grouped
in
considerable
force
at
several
of
the
street
corners
and
he
always
gave
me
this
pleasant
salutation
hello
mark
here
to
you
old
chap
say
mark
is
he
dead
a
reference
to
a
passage
in
some
book
of
mine
though
i
did
not
detect
at
that
time
that
that
was
its
source
and
i
did
detect
it
afterward
in
melbourne
when
i
came
on
the
stage
for
the
first
time
and
the
same
question
was
dropped
down
upon
me
from
the
dizzy
height
of
the
gallery
it
is
always
difficult
to
answer
a
sudden
inquiry
like
that
when
you
have
come
unprepared
and
do
know
what
it
means
i
will
remark
here
if
it
is
not
an
indecorum
that
the
welcome
which
an
american
lecturer
gets
from
a
british
colonial
audience
is
a
thing
which
will
move
him
to
his
deepest
deeps
and
veil
his
sight
and
break
his
voice
and
from
winnipeg
to
africa
experience
will
teach
him
nothing
he
will
never
learn
to
expect
it
it
will
catch
him
as
a
surprise
each
time
the
hanging
black
over
england
and
america
made
no
trouble
for
me
i
was
a
prospective
prisoner
of
war
but
at
dinners
suppers
on
the
platform
and
elsewhere
there
was
never
anything
to
remind
me
of
it
this
was
hospitality
of
the
right
metal
and
would
have
been
prominently
lacking
in
some
countries
in
the
circumstances
and
speaking
of
the
it
seemed
to
me
to
bring
to
light
the
unexpected
in
a
detail
or
two
it
seemed
to
relegate
the
to
the
politicians
on
both
sides
of
the
water
whereas
whenever
a
prospective
war
between
two
nations
had
been
in
the
air
theretofore
the
public
had
done
most
of
the
talking
and
the
bitterest
the
attitude
of
the
newspapers
was
new
also
i
speak
of
those
of
australasia
and
india
for
i
had
access
to
those
only
they
treated
the
subject
argumentatively
and
with
dignity
not
with
spite
and
anger
that
was
a
new
spirit
too
and
not
learned
of
the
french
and
german
press
either
before
sedan
or
since
i
heard
many
public
speeches
and
they
reflected
the
moderation
of
the
journals
the
outlook
is
that
the
race
will
dominate
the
earth
a
hundred
years
from
now
if
its
sections
do
not
get
to
fighting
each
other
it
would
be
a
pity
to
spoil
that
prospect
by
baffling
and
retarding
wars
when
arbitration
would
settle
their
differences
so
much
better
and
also
so
much
more
definitely
no
as
i
have
suggested
novelties
are
rare
in
the
great
capitals
of
modern
times
even
the
wool
exchange
in
melbourne
could
not
be
told
from
the
familiar
stock
exchange
of
other
countries
wool
brokers
are
just
like
stockbrokers
they
all
bounce
from
their
seats
and
put
up
their
hands
and
yell
in
unison
no
stranger
can
tell
what
and
the
president
calmly
says
sold
to
smith
threpence
farthing
next
when
probably
nothing
of
the
kind
happened
for
how
should
he
know
in
the
museums
you
will
find
acres
of
the
most
strange
and
fascinating
things
but
all
museums
are
fascinating
and
they
do
so
tire
your
eyes
and
break
your
back
and
burn
out
your
vitalities
with
their
consuming
interest
you
always
say
you
will
never
go
again
but
you
do
go
the
palaces
of
the
rich
in
melbourne
are
much
like
the
palaces
of
the
rich
in
america
and
the
life
in
them
is
the
same
but
there
the
resemblance
ends
the
grounds
surrounding
the
american
palace
are
not
often
large
and
not
often
beautiful
but
in
the
melbourne
case
the
grounds
are
often
ducally
spacious
and
the
climate
and
the
gardeners
together
make
them
as
beautiful
as
a
dream
it
is
said
that
some
of
the
country
seats
have
grounds
domains
about
them
which
rival
in
charm
and
magnitude
those
which
surround
the
country
mansion
of
an
english
lord
but
i
was
not
out
in
the
country
i
had
my
hands
full
in
town
and
what
was
the
origin
of
this
majestic
city
and
its
efflorescence
of
palatial
town
houses
and
country
seats
its
first
brick
was
laid
and
its
first
house
built
by
a
passing
convict
australian
history
is
almost
always
picturesque
indeed
it
is
so
curious
and
strange
that
it
is
itself
the
chiefest
novelty
the
country
has
to
offer
and
so
it
pushes
the
other
novelties
into
second
and
third
place
it
does
not
read
like
history
but
like
the
most
beautiful
lies
and
all
of
a
fresh
new
sort
no
mouldy
old
stale
ones
it
is
full
of
surprises
and
adventures
and
incongruities
and
contradictions
and
incredibilities
but
they
are
all
true
they
all
happened

wilson

when
we

in

the

my

make

of
a

larger
than
the
russian

roughly

the

the

show
that
the

for

on

the

aggregate
production
would
be
nearly
truly
nothing
is
so
astonishing
as
figures
if
they
once
get
started
we
left
melbourne
by
rail
for
adelaide
the
capital
of
the
vast
province
of
south
australia
a
excursion
on
the
train
we
found
several
sydney
friends
among
them
a
judge
who
was
going
out
on
circuit
and
was
going
to
hold
court
at
broken
hill
where
the
celebrated
silver
mine
is
it
seemed
a
curious
road
to
take
to
get
to
that
region
broken
hill
is
close
to
the
western
border
of
new
south
wales
and
sydney
is
on
the
eastern
border
a
fairly
straight
line
miles
long
drawn
westward
from
sydney
would
strike
broken
hill
just
as
a
somewhat
shorter
one
drawn
west
from
boston
would
strike
buffalo
the
way
the
judge
was
traveling
would
carry
him
over
miles
by
rail
he
said
southwest
from
sydney
down
to
melbourne
then
northward
up
to
adelaide
then
a
cant
back
northeastward
and
over
the
border
into
new
south
wales
once
more
to
broken
hill
it
was
like
going
from
boston
southwest
to
richmond
virginia
then
northwest
up
to
erie
pennsylvania
then
a
cant
back
northeast
and
over
the
border
to
buffalo
new
york
but
the
explanation
was
simple
years
ago
the
fabulously
rich
silver
discovery
at
broken
hill
burst
suddenly
upon
an
unexpectant
world
its
stocks
started
at
shillings
and
went
by
leaps
and
bounds
to
the
most
fanciful
figures
it
was
one
of
those
cases
where
the
cook
puts
a
month
wages
into
shares
and
comes
next
mouth
and
buys
your
house
at
your
own
price
and
moves
into
it
herself
where
the
coachman
takes
a
few
shares
and
next
month
sets
up
a
bank
and
where
the
common
sailor
invests
the
price
of
a
spree
and
next
month
buys
out
the
steamship
company
and
goes
into
business
on
his
own
hook
in
a
word
it
was
one
of
those
excitements
which
bring
multitudes
of
people
to
a
common
center
with
a
rush
and
whose
needs
must
be
supplied
and
at
once
adelaide
was
close
by
sydney
was
far
away
adelaide
threw
a
short
railway
across
the
border
before
sydney
had
time
to
arrange
for
a
long
one
it
was
not
worth
while
for
sydney
to
arrange
at
all
the
whole
vast
of
broken
hill
fell
into
adelaide
hands
irrevocably
new
south
wales
furnishes
for
broken
hill
and
sends
her
judges
miles
mainly
through
alien
countries
to
administer
it
but
adelaide
takes
the
dividends
and
makes
no
moan
we
started
at
in
the
afternoon
and
moved
across
level
until
night
in
the
morning
we
had
a
stretch
of
scrub
country
the
kind
of
thing
which
is
so
useful
to
the
australian
novelist
in
the
scrub
the
hostile
aboriginal
lurks
and
flits
mysteriously
about
slipping
out
from
time
to
time
to
surprise
and
slaughter
the
settler
then
slipping
back
again
and
leaving
no
track
that
the
white
man
can
follow
in
the
scrub
the
novelist
heroine
gets
lost
search
fails
of
result
she
wanders
here
and
there
and
finally
sinks
down
exhausted
and
unconscious
and
the
searchers
pass
within
a
yard
or
two
of
her
not
suspecting
that
she
is
near
and
by
and
by
some
rambler
finds
her
bones
and
the
pathetic
diary
which
she
had
scribbled
with
her
failing
hand
and
left
behind
nobody
can
find
a
lost
heroine
in
the
scrub
but
the
aboriginal
tracker
and
he
will
not
lend
himself
to
the
scheme
if
it
will
interfere
with
the
novelist
plot
the
scrub
stretches
miles
and
miles
in
all
directions
and
looks
like
a
level
roof
of
without
a
break
or
a
crack
in
it
as
seamless
as
a
blanket
to
all
appearance
one
might
as
well
walk
under
water
and
hope
to
guess
out
a
route
and
stick
to
it
i
should
think
yet
it
is
claimed
that
the
aboriginal
tracker
was
able
to
hunt
out
people
lost
in
the
scrub
also
in
the
bush
also
in
the
desert
and
even
follow
them
over
patches
of
bare
rocks
and
over
alluvial
ground
which
had
to
all
appearance
been
washed
clear
of
footprints
from
reading
australian
books
and
talking
with
the
people
i
became
convinced
that
the
aboriginal
tracker
performances
evince
a
craft
a
penetration
a
luminous
sagacity
and
a
minuteness
and
accuracy
of
observation
in
the
matter
of
not
found
in
nearly
so
remarkable
a
degree
in
any
other
people
white
or
colored
in
an
official
account
of
the
blacks
of
australia
published
by
the
government
of
victoria
one
reads
that
the
aboriginal
not
only
notices
the
faint
marks
left
on
the
bark
of
a
tree
by
the
claws
of
a
climbing
opossum
but
knows
in
some
way
or
other
whether
the
marks
were
made
or
yesterday
and
there
is
the
case
on
records
where
a
settler
makes
a
bet
with
that
may
lose
a
cow
as
effectually
as
he
can
and
will
produce
an
aboriginal
who
will
find
her
selects
a
cow
and
lets
the
tracker
see
the
cow
footprint
then
be
put
under
guard
then
drives
the
cow
a
few
miles
over
a
course
which
drifts
in
all
directions
and
frequently
doubles
back
upon
itself
and
he
selects
difficult
ground
all
the
time
and
once
or
twice
even
drives
the
cow
through
herds
of
other
cows
and
mingles
her
tracks
in
the
wide
confusion
of
theirs
he
finally
brings
his
cow
home
the
aboriginal
is
set
at
liberty
and
at
once
moves
around
in
a
great
circle
examining
all
until
he
finds
the
one
he
is
after
then
sets
off
and
follows
it
throughout
its
erratic
course
and
ultimately
tracks
it
to
the
stable
where
has
hidden
the
cow
now
wherein
does
one
differ
from
another
there
must
be
a
difference
or
the
tracker
could
not
have
performed
the
feat
a
difference
minute
shadowy
and
not
detectible
by
you
or
me
or
by
the
late
sherlock
holmes
and

of

some
people

wilson
new
calendar
the
train
was
now
exploring
a
beautiful
hill
country
and
went
twisting
in
and
out
through
lovely
little
green
valleys
there
were
several
varieties
of
gum
trees
among
them
many
giants
some
of
them
were
bodied
and
barked
like
the
sycamore
some
were
of
fantastic
aspect
and
reminded
one
of
the
quaint
apple
trees
in
japanese
pictures
and
there
was
one
peculiarly
beautiful
tree
whose
name
and
breed
i
did
not
know
the
foliage
seemed
to
consist
of
big
bunches
of
the
lower
half
of
each
bunch
a
rich
brown
or
color
the
upper
half
a
most
vivid
and
strenuous
and
shouting
green
the
effect
was
altogether
bewitching
the
tree
was
apparently
rare
i
should
say
that
the
first
and
last
samples
of
it
seen
by
us
were
not
more
than
half
an
hour
apart
there
was
another
tree
of
striking
aspect
a
kind
of
pine
we
were
told
its
foliage
was
as
fine
as
hair
apparently
and
its
mass
sphered
itself
above
the
naked
straight
stem
like
an
explosion
of
misty
smoke
it
was
not
a
sociable
sort
it
did
not
gather
in
groups
or
couples
but
each
individual
stood
far
away
from
its
nearest
neighbor
it
scattered
itself
in
this
spacious
and
exclusive
fashion
about
the
slopes
of
swelling
grassy
great
knolls
and
stood
in
the
full
flood
of
the
wonderful
sunshine
and
as
far
as
you
could
see
the
tree
itself
you
could
also
see
the
blot
of
its
shadow
on
the
shining
green
carpet
at
its
feet
on
some
part
of
this
railway
journey
we
saw
gorse
and
broom
importations
from
england
and
a
gentleman
who
came
into
our
compartment
on
a
visit
tried
to
tell
me
which
was
which
but
as
he
did
know
he
had
difficulty
he
said
he
was
ashamed
of
his
ignorance
but
that
he
had
never
been
confronted
with
the
question
before
during
the
fifty
years
and
more
that
he
had
spent
in
australia
and
so
he
had
never
happened
to
get
interested
in
the
matter
but
there
was
no
need
to
be
ashamed
the
most
of
us
have
his
defect
we
take
a
natural
interest
in
novelties
but
it
is
against
nature
to
take
an
interest
in
familiar
things
the
gorse
and
the
broom
were
a
fine
accent
in
the
landscape
here
and
there
they
burst
out
in
sudden
conflagrations
of
vivid
yellow
against
a
background
of
sober
or
sombre
color
with
a
so
startling
effect
as
to
make
a
body
catch
his
breath
with
the
happy
surprise
of
it
and
then
there
was
the
wattle
a
native
bush
or
tree
an
inspiring
cloud
of
sumptuous
yellow
bloom
it
is
a
favorite
with
the
australians
and
has
a
fine
fragrance
a
quality
usually
wanting
in
australian
blossoms
the
gentleman
who
enriched
me
with
the
poverty
of
his
formation
about
the
gorse
and
the
broom
told
me
that
he
came
out
from
england
a
youth
of
twenty
and
entered
the
province
of
south
australia
with
shillings
in
his
pocket
an
adventurer
without
trade
profession
or
friends
but
with
a
purpose
in
his
head
he
would
stay
until
he
was
worth
then
go
back
home
he
would
allow
himself
five
years
for
the
accumulation
of
this
fortune
that
was
more
than
fifty
years
ago
said
he
and
here
i
am
yet
as
he
went
out
at
the
door
he
met
a
friend
and
turned
and
introduced
him
to
me
and
the
friend
and
i
had
a
talk
and
a
smoke
i
spoke
of
the
previous
conversation
and
said
there
something
very
pathetic
about
this
half
century
of
exile
and
that
i
wished
the
scheme
had
succeeded
with
him
oh
it
did
it
not
so
sad
a
case
he
is
modest
and
he
left
out
some
of
the
particulars
the
lad
reached
south
australia
just
in
time
to
help
discover
the
copper
mines
they
turned
out
in
the
first
three
years
up
to
now
they
have
yielded
he
has
had
his
share
before
that
boy
had
been
in
the
country
two
years
he
could
have
gone
home
and
bought
a
village
he
could
go
now
and
buy
a
city
i
think
no
there
is
nothing
very
pathetic
about
his
case
he
and
his
copper
arrived
at
just
a
handy
time
to
save
south
australia
it
had
got
mashed
pretty
flat
under
the
collapse
of
a

a

in

in

erected
it

a

into
a
province
and
gave
it
a
governor
and
other
governmental
machinery
speculators
took
hold
now
and
inaugurated
a
vast

scheme
and
invited
immigration
encouraging
it
with
lurid
promises
of
sudden

it
was
well
worked
in
london
and
bishops

and
all

still

everybody
was

and
happy
the

swelled
into
gigantic

a

this
fine

drank
champagne

in

ways
conducted
itself
in

capital
of
humble

it

to
do

came
the

from

rich

were
discovered
and
the

up

the

after

went
over
the
border
and
took
it
giving
thanks
among
our
passengers
was
an
american
with
a
unique
vocation
unique
is
a
strong
word
but
i
use
it
justifiably
if
i
did
not
misconceive
what
the
american
told
me
for
i
understood
him
to
say
that
in
the
world
there
was
not
another
man
engaged
in
the
business
which
he
was
following
he
was
buying
the
crop
buying
all
of
it
both
the
australian
crop
and
the
tasmanian
and
buying
it
for
an
american
house
in
new
york
the
prices
were
not
high
as
there
was
no
competition
but
the
aggregate
of
skins
would
cost
him
i
had
had
the
idea
that
the
kangaroo
was
about
extinct
in
tasmania
and
well
thinned
out
on
the
continent
in
america
the
skins
are
tanned
and
made
into
shoes
after
the
tanning
the
leather
takes
a
new
name
which
i
have
forgotten
i
only
remember
that
the
new
name
does
not
indicate
that
the
kangaroo
furnishes
the
leather
there
was
a
german
competition
for
a
while
some
years
ago
but
that
has
ceased
the
germans
failed
to
arrive
at
the
secret
of
tanning
the
skins
successfully
and
they
withdrew
from
the
business
now
then
i
suppose
that
i
have
seen
a
man
whose
occupation
is
really
entitled
to
bear
that
high
epithet
unique
and
i
suppose
that
there
is
not
another
occupation
in
the
world
that
is
restricted
to
the
hands
of
a
sole
person
i
can
think
of
no
instance
of
it
there
is
more
than
one
pope
there
is
more
than
one

there
is
even
more
than
one
living
god
walking
upon
the
earth
and
worshiped
in
all
sincerity
by
large
populations
of
men
i
have
seen
and
talked
with
two
of
these
beings
myself
in
india
and
i
have
the
autograph
of
one
of
them
it
can
come
good
by
and
by
i
reckon
if
i
attach
it
to
a
permit
approaching
adelaide
we
dismounted
from
the
train
as
the
french
say
and
were
driven
in
an
open
carriage
over
the
hills
and
along
their
slopes
to
the
city
it
was
an
excursion
of
an
hour
or
two
and
the
charm
of
it
could
not
be
overstated
i
think
the
road
wound
around
gaps
and
gorges
and
offered
all
varieties
of
scenery
and
prospect
mountains
crags
country
homes
gardens
forests
color
color
color
everywhere
and
the
air
fine
and
fresh
the
skies
blue
and
not
a
shred
of
cloud
to
mar
the
downpour
of
the
brilliant
sunshine
and
finally
the
mountain
gateway
opened
and
the
immense
plain
lay
spread
out
below
and
stretching
away
into
dim
distances
on
every
hand
soft
and
delicate
and
dainty
and
beautiful
on
its
near
edge
reposed
the
city
we
descended
and
entered
there
was
nothing
to
remind
one
of
the
humble
capital
of
buts
and
sheds
of
the
day
of
the
no
this
was
a
modern
city
with
wide
streets
compactly
built
with
fine
homes
everywhere
embowered
in
foliage
and
flowers
and
with
imposing
masses
of
public
buildings
nobly
grouped
and
architecturally
beautiful
there
was
prosperity
in
the
air
for
another
boom
was
on
providence
desiring
to
show
especial
regard
for
the
neighboring
colony
on
the
west
called
western
australia
and
exhibit
a
loving
interest
in
its
welfare
which
should
certify
to
all
nations
the
recognition
of
that
conspicuous
righteousness
and
distinguished
had
recently
conferred
upon
it
that
majestic
treasury
of
golden
riches
coolgardie
and
now
south
australia
had
gone
around
the
corner
and
taken
it
giving
thanks
everything
comes
to
him
who
is
patient
and
good
and
waits
but
south
australia
deserves
much
for
apparently
she
is
a
hospitable
home
for
every
alien
who
chooses
to
come
and
for
his
religion
too
she
has
a
population
as
per
the
latest
census

and
yet
her
varieties
of
religion
indicate
the
presence
within
her
borders
of
samples
of
people
from
pretty
nearly
every
part
of
the

can
think

it

the

these

in

in

the
heat
at
adelaide
south
australia
was
degrees
in
the
sun
when
the
white
man
came
the
continent
was
nearly
as
poor
in
variety
of
vegetation
as
the
desert
of
sahara
now
it
has
everything
that
grows
on
the
earth
in
fact
not
australia
only
but
all
australasia
has
levied
tribute
upon
the
flora
of
the
rest
of
the
world
and
wherever
one
goes
the
results
appear
in
gardens
private
and
public
in
the
woodsy
walls
of
the
highways
and
in
even
the
forests
if
you
see
a
curious
or
beautiful
tree
or
bush
or
flower
and
ask
about
it

and
so
on
in
the
zoological
gardens
of
adelaide
i
saw
the
only
laughing
jackass
that
ever
showed
any
disposition
to
be
courteous
to
me
this
one
opened
his
head
wide
and
laughed
like
a
demon
or
like
a
maniac
who
was
consumed
with
humorous
scorn
over
a
cheap
and
degraded
pun
it
was
a
very
human
laugh
if
he
had
been
out
of
sight
i
could
have
believed
that
the
laughter
came
from
a
man
it
is
an
bird
with
a
head
and
beak
that
are
much
too
large
for
its
body
in
time
man
will
exterminate
the
rest
of
the
wild
creatures
of
australia
but
this
one
will
probably
survive
for
man
is
his
friend
and
lets
him
alone
man
always
has
a
good
reason
for
his
charities
towards
wild
things
human
or
animal
when
he
has
any
in
this
case
the
bird
is
spared
because
he
kills
snakes
if
he
will
not
kill
all
of
them
in
that
garden
i
also
saw
the
wild
australian
dog
the
dingo
he
was
a
beautiful
creature
shapely
graceful
a
little
wolfish
in
some
of
his
aspects
but
with
a
most
friendly
eye
and
sociable
disposition
the
dingo
is
not
an
importation
he
was
present
in
great
force
when
the
whites
first
came
to
the
continent
it
may
be
that
he
is
the
oldest
dog
in
the
universe
his
origin
his
descent
the
place
where
his
ancestors
first
appeared
are
as
unknown
and
as
untraceable
as
are
the
camel
he
is
the
most
precious
dog
in
the
world
for
he
does
not
bark
but
in
an
evil
hour
he
got
to
raiding
the
to
appease
his
hunger
and
that
sealed
his
doom
he
is
hunted
now
just
as
if
he
were
a
wolf
he
has
been
sentenced
to
extermination
and
the
sentence
will
be
carried
out
this
is
all
right
and
not
objectionable
the
world
was
made

the
white

south
australia
is
confusingly
named
all
of
the
colonies
have
a
southern
exposure
except
one
queensland
properly
speaking
south
australia
is
middle
australia
it
extends
straight
up
through
the
center
of
the
continent
like
the
middle
board
in
a
it
is
miles
high
from
south
to
north
and
about
a
third
as
wide
a
wee
little
spot
down
in
its
southeastern
corner
contains
eight
or
of
its
population
the
other
one
or
are
elsewhere
as
elsewhere
as
they
could
be
in
the
united
states
with
all
the
country
between
denver
and
chicago
and
canada
and
the
gulf
of
mexico
to
scatter
over
there
is
plenty
of
room
a
telegraph
line
stretches
straight
up
north
through
that
miles
of
wilderness
and
desert
from
adelaide
to
port
darwin
on
the
edge
of
the
upper
ocean
south
australia
built
the
line
and
did
it
in
when
her
population
numbered
only
it
was
a
great
work
for
there
were
no
roads
no
paths
miles
of
the
route
had
been
traversed
but
once
before
by
white
men
provisions
wire
and
poles
had
to
be
carried
over
immense
stretches
of
desert
wells
had
to
be
dug
along
the
route
to
supply
the
men
and
cattle
with
water
a
cable
had
been
previously
laid
from
port
darwin
to
java
and
thence
to
india
and
there
was
telegraphic
communication
with
england
from
india
and
so
if
adelaide
could
make
connection
with
port
darwin
it
meant
connection
with
the
whole
world
the
enterprise
succeeded
one
could
watch
the
london
markets
daily
now
the
profit
to
the
of
australia
was
instant
and
enormous
a
telegram
from
melbourne
to
san
francisco
covers
approximately
miles
the
equivalent
of
of
the
way
around
the
globe
it
has
to
halt
along
the
way
a
good
many
times
and
be
repeated
still
but
little
time
is
lost
these
halts
and
the

between

i
was
in

again
some
months
later
and
saw
the
multitudes
gather
in
the
neighboring
city
of
glenelg
to
commemorate
the
reading
of
the
proclamation
in
which
founded
the
province
if
i
have
at
any
time
called
it
a
colony
i
withdraw
the
discourtesy
it
is
not
a
colony
it
is
a
province
and
officially
so
moreover
it
is
the
only
one
so
named
in
australasia
there
was
great
enthusiasm
it
was
the
national
holiday
its
fourth
of
july
so
to
speak
it
is
the
holiday
and
that
is
saying
much
in
a
country
where
they
seem
to
have
a
most
mania
for
holidays
mainly
they
are
holidays
for
in
south
australia
the
workingman
is
sovereign
his
vote
is
the
desire
of
the
politician
indeed
it
is
the
very
breath
of
the
politician
being
the
parliament
exists
to
deliver
the
will
of
the
workingman
and
the
government
exists
to
execute
it
the
workingman
is
a
great
power
everywhere
in
australia
but
south
australia
is
his
paradise
he
has
had
a
hard
time
in
this
world
and
has
earned
a
paradise
i
am
glad
he
has
found
it
the
holidays
there
are
frequent
enough
to
be
bewildering
to
the
stranger
i
tried
to
get
the
hang
of
the
system
but
was
not
able
to
do
it
you
have
seen
that
the
province
is
tolerant
it
is
so
politically
also
one
of
the
speakers
at
the
commemoration
banquet
the
minister
of
public
an
american
born
and
reared
in
new
england
there
is
nothing
narrow
about
the
province
politically
or
in
any
other
way
that
i
know
of
religions
and
a
yankee
cabinet
minister
no
amount
of
can
damn
this
community
the
mean
temperature
of
the
province
is
deg
the
is
in
the
about
half
what
it
is
in
the
city
of
new
york
i
should
think
and
new
york
is
a
healthy
city
thirteen
is
the
for
the
average
citizen
of
the
province
but
there
seems
to
be
no
for
the
old
people
there
were
people
at
the
commemoration
banquet
who
could
remember
cromwell
there
were
six
of
them
these
old
settlers
had
all
been
present
at
the
original
reading
of
the
proclamation
in
they
showed
signs
of
the
blightings
and
blastings
of
time
in
their
outward
aspect
but
they
were
young
within
young
and
cheerful
and
ready
to
talk
ready
to
talk
and
talk
all
you
wanted
in
their
turn
and
out
of
it
they
were
down
for
six
speeches
and
they
made
the
governor
and
the
cabinet
and
the
mayor
were
down
for
speeches
and
they
made
they
have
splendid
grit
the
old
settlers
splendid
staying
power
but
they
do
not
hear
well
and
when
they
see
the
mayor
going
through
motions
which
they
recognize
as
the
introducing
of
a
speaker
they
think
they
are
the
one
and
they
all
get
up
together
and
begin
to
respond
in
the
most
animated
way
and
the
more
the
mayor
gesticulates
and
shouts
sit
down
sit
down
the
more
they
take
it
for
applause
and
the
more
excited
and
reminiscent
and
enthusiastic
they
get
and
next
when
they
see
the
whole
house
laughing
and
crying
three
of
them
think
it
is
about
the
bitter
hardships
they
are
describing
and
the
other
three
think
the
laughter
is
caused
by
the
jokes
they
have
been
uncorking
jokes
of
the
vintage
of
and
then
the
way
they
do
go
on
and
finally
when
ushers
come
and
plead
and
beg
and
gently
and
reverently
crowd
them
down
into
their
seats
they
say
oh
i
not
tired
i
could
bang
along
a
week
and
they
sit
there
looking
simple
and
childlike
and
gentle
and
proud
of
their
oratory
and
wholly
unconscious
of
what
is
going
on
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
so
one
of
the
great
dignitaries
gets
a
chance
and
begins
his
carefully
prepared
speech
impressively
and
with
solemnity
when
we
now
great
and
prosperous
and
powerful
bow
our
heads
in
reverent
wonder
in
the
contemplation
of
those
sublimities
of
energy
of
wisdom
of
forethought
of
up
come
the
immortal
six
again
in
a
body
with
a
joyous
hey
thought
of
another
one
and
at
it
they
go
with
might
and
main
hearing
not
a
whisper
of
the
pandemonium
that
salutes
them
but
taking
all
the
visible
violences
for
applause
as
before
and
hammering
joyously
away
till
the
imploring
ushers
pray
them
into
their
seats
again
and
a
pity
too
for
those
lovely
old
boys
did
so
enjoy
living
their
heroic
youth
over
in
these
days
of
their
honored
antiquity
and
certainly
the
things
they
had
to
tell
were
usually
worth
the
telling
and
the
hearing
it
was
a
stirring
spectacle
stirring
in
more
ways
than
one
for
it
was
amazingly
funny
and
at
the
same
time
deeply
pathetic
for
they
had
seen
so
much
these
veterans
end
had
suffered
so
much
and
had
built
so
strongly
and
well
and
laid
the
foundations
of
their
commonwealth
so
deep
in
liberty
and
tolerance
and
had
lived
to
see
the
structure
rise
to
such
state
and
dignity
and
hear
themselves
so
praised
for
honorable
work
one
of
these
old
gentlemen
told
me
some
things
of
interest
afterward
things
about
the
aboriginals
mainly
he
thought
them
intelligent
remarkably
so
in
some
directions
and
he
said
that
along
with
their
unpleasant
qualities
they
had
some
exceedingly
good
ones
and
he
considered
it
a
great
pity
that
the
race
had
died
out
he
instanced
their
invention
of
the
boomerang
and
the
as
evidences
of
their
brightness
and
as
another
evidence
of
it
he
said
he
had
never
seen
a
white
man
who
had
cleverness
enough
to
learn
to
do
the
miracles
with
those
two
toys
that
the
aboriginals
achieved
he
said
that
even
the
smartest
whites
had
been
obliged
to
confess
that
they
could
not
learn
the
trick
of
the
boomerang
in
perfection
that
it
had
possibilities
which
they
could
not
master
the
white
man
could
not
control
its
motions
could
not
make
it
obey
him
but
the
aboriginal
could
he
told
me
some
wonderful
things
some
almost
incredible
things
which
he
had
seen
the
blacks
do
with
the
boomerang
and
the
they
have
been
confirmed
to
me
since
by
other
early
settlers
and
by
trustworthy
books
it
is
contended
and
may
be
said
to
be
conceded
that
the
boomerang
was
known
to
certain
savage
tribes
in
europe
in
roman
times
in
support
of
this
virgil
and
two
other
roman
poets
are
quoted
it
is
also
contended
that
it
was
known
to
the
ancient
egyptians
one
of
two
things
either
some
one
with
is
then
apparent
a
boomerang
arrived
in
australia
in
the
days
