chapter
one
it
was
friday
the
day
he
always
came
if
so
she
safeguarded
it
he
was
to
come
at
all
they
had
left
it
that
way
in
the
beginning
that
it
should
be
open
to
him
to
come
or
not
to
come
they
had
not
even
settled
that
it
should
be
fridays
but
it
always
was
the
being
the
only
time
when
he
could
get
away
the
only
time
he
had
explained
to
agatha
verrall
when
getting
away
excited
no
remark
he
had
to
or
he
would
have
broken
down
agatha
called
it
getting
away
from
things
but
she
knew
that
there
was
only
one
thing
his
wife
bella
to
be
wedded
to
a
mass
of
furious
and
malignant
nerves
which
was
all
that
poor
bella
was
now
simply
meant
destruction
to
a
man
like
rodney
lanyon
rodney
own
nerves
were
not
as
strong
as
they
had
been
after
ten
years
of
bella
it
had
been
understood
for
long
enough
understood
even
by
bella
that
if
he
could
have
his
weekends
he
was
done
for
he
could
possibly
have
stood
the
torment
and
the
strain
of
her
of
course
she
did
know
he
spent
the
greater
part
of
them
with
agatha
verrall
it
was
not
to
be
desired
that
she
should
know
her
obtuseness
helped
them
even
in
her
younger
and
saner
days
she
had
failed
persistently
to
realise
any
profound
and
poignant
thing
that
touched
him
so
by
the
mercy
of
heaven
she
had
never
realised
agatha
verrall
she
used
to
say
that
she
had
never
seen
anything
agatha
which
amounted
as
he
once
told
her
to
not
seeing
agatha
at
all
still
less
could
she
have
compassed
any
vision
of
the
tie
the
extraordinary
intangible
immaterial
tie
that
held
them
sometimes
at
the
last
moment
his
escape
to
agatha
would
prove
impossible
so
they
had
left
it
further
that
he
was
to
send
her
no
forewarning
he
was
to
come
when
and
as
he
could
he
could
always
get
a
room
in
the
village
inn
or
at
the
farm
near
by
and
in
agatha
house
he
would
find
his
place
ready
for
him
the
place
which
had
become
his
refuge
his
place
of
peace
there
was
no
need
to
prepare
her
she
was
never
not
prepared
it
was
as
if
by
her
preparedness
by
the
absence
of
preliminaries
of
adjustments
and
arrangements
he
was
always
there
lodged
in
the
innermost
chamber
she
had
set
herself
apart
she
had
swept
herself
bare
and
scoured
herself
clean
for
him
clean
she
had
to
be
clean
from
the
desire
that
he
should
come
clean
above
all
from
the
thought
the
knowledge
she
now
had
that
she
could
make
him
come
for
if
she
had
given
herself
up
to
but
she
never
had
never
since
the
knowledge
came
to
her
since
she
discovered
wonderfully
by
a
divine
accident
that
at
any
moment
she
could
make
him
that
she
had
whatever
it
was
the
power
the
uncanny
unaccountable
gift
she
was
beginning
to
see
more
and
more
how
it
worked
how
inevitably
how
infallibly
it
worked
she
was
even
a
little
afraid
of
it
of
what
it
might
come
to
mean
it
mean
that
without
his
knowledge
separated
as
they
were
and
had
to
be
she
could
always
get
at
him
and
supposing
it
came
to
mean
that
she
could
get
at
him
to
make
him
do
things
why
the
bare
idea
of
it
was
horrible
nothing
could
well
have
been
horrible
to
agatha
it
was
the
secret
and
the
essence
of
their
remarkable
relation
that
she
had
never
tried
to
get
at
him
whereas
bella
calamitously
and
still
more
calamitously
because
of
the
peculiar
magic
that
there
was
there
must
have
been
in
her
bella
had
succeeded
to
have
tried
to
get
at
him
would
have
been
for
agatha
the
last
treachery
the
last
indecency
while
for
rodney
it
would
have
been
the
destruction
of
her
charm
she
was
the
way
of
escape
for
him
from
bella
but
she
had
always
left
her
door
even
the
innermost
door
wide
open
so
that
where
shelter
and
protection
faced
him
there
faced
him
also
the
way
of
departure
the
way
of
escape
from
and
if
her
thought
could
get
at
him
and
fasten
on
him
and
shut
him
in
there
it
could
she
knew
but
it
need
not
she
was
really
all
right
restraint
had
been
the
essence
and
the
secret
of
the
charm
she
had
and
it
was
also
the
secret
and
the
essence
of
her
gift
why
she
had
brought
it
to
so
fine
a
point
that
she
could
shut
out
and
by
shutting
out
destroy
any
feeling
any
thought
that
did
violence
to
any
other
she
could
shut
them
all
out
if
it
came
to
that
and
make
the
whole
place
empty
so
that
if
this
knowledge
of
her
power
did
violence
she
had
only
to
close
her
door
on
it
she
closed
it
now
on
the
bare
thought
of
his
coming
on
the
little
innocent
hope
she
had
that
he
would
come
by
an
ultimate
refinement
and
subtlety
of
honour
she
refused
to
let
even
expectation
cling
to
him
but
though
it
was
dreadful
to
work
her
gift
that
way
to
make
him
do
things
there
was
another
way
in
which
she
did
work
it
lawfully
sacredly
incorruptibly
the
way
it
first
came
to
her
she
had
worked
it
twenty
times
without
his
knowledge
for
how
he
would
have
scoffed
at
her
to
make
him
well
before
it
had
come
to
her
he
had
been
ever
since
she
knew
him
more
or
less
ill
more
or
less
tormented
by
the
nerves
that
were
wedded
so
indissolubly
to
bella
he
was
always
it
seemed
to
her
terror
on
the
verge
and
she
could
say
to
herself
look
at
him
his
abrupt
incredible
recovery
had
been
the
first
open
manifestation
of
the
way
it
worked
not
that
she
had
tried
it
on
him
first
before
she
dared
do
that
once
she
had
proved
it
on
herself
twenty
times
she
had
proved
it
up
to
the
hilt
but
to
ensure
continuous
results
it
had
to
be
a
continuous
process
and
in
order
to
give
herself
up
to
it
to
him
to
his
pitiful
case
she
had
lately
as
her
friends
said
cut
herself
completely
off
she
had
gone
down
into
buckinghamshire
and
taken
a
small
solitary
house
at
sarratt
end
in
the
valley
of
the
chess
three
miles
from
the
nearest
station
she
had
shut
herself
up
in
a
world
half
a
mile
long
one
straight
hill
to
the
north
one
to
the
south
two
strips
of
flat
pasture
the
river
and
the
white
between
a
world
closed
east
and
west
by
the
turn
the
valley
takes
there
between
the
hills
and
barred
by
a
gate
at
each
end
of
the
a
land
of
pure
curves
of
delicate
colours
delicate
shadows
all
winter
through
a
land
of
grey
woods
and
sallow
fields
of
ploughed
hillsides
pale
with
the
white
strain
of
the
chalk
in
april
it
was
april
now
a
land
shining
with
silver
and
with
green
and
the
ways
out
of
it
led
into
lanes
it
had
neither
sight
nor
hearing
of
the
high
roads
beyond
there
were
only
two
houses
in
that
of
valley
agatha
house
and
woodman
farm
agatha
house
white
as
a
cutting
in
the
chalk
downs
looked
southwest
up
the
valley
and
across
it
to
where
a
slender
beech
wood
went
lightly
up
the
hill
and
then
stretched
out
in
a
straight
line
along
the
top
with
the
bare
flank
of
the
ploughed
land
below
the
farmhouse
looked
east
towards
agatha
house
across
a
field
a
house
dull
dark
red
with
the
grey
bloom
of
weather
on
it
and
two
windows
on
each
side
of
the
door
and
a
row
of
five
above
all
nine
staring
at
the
small
white
house
across
the
field
the
narrow
flat
linked
the
two
except
rodney
when
his
inn
was
full
nobody
ever
came
to
woodman
farm
and
agatha
house
set
down
inside
its
east
gate
shared
its
isolation
its
immunity
two
villages
unseen
unheard
served
her
not
a
mile
away
it
was
impossible
to
be
more
sheltered
more
protected
and
more
utterly
cut
off
and
only
fifteen
miles
as
the
crow
flies
between
this
solitude
and
london
so
that
it
was
easy
for
rodney
lanyon
to
come
down
at
two
the
hour
when
he
must
come
if
he
were
coming
she
began
to
listen
for
the
click
of
the
latch
at
the
garden
gate
she
had
agreed
with
herself
that
at
the
last
moment
expectancy
could
do
no
harm
it
could
influence
him
for
either
he
had
taken
the
train
at
marylebone
or
he
had
not
agatha
was
so
far
reasonable
so
at
the
last
moment
she
permitted
herself
that
dangerous
and
terrible
joy
when
the
click
came
and
his
footsteps
after
it
she
admitted
further
now
when
it
could
do
no
harm
that
she
had
had
foreknowledge
of
him
she
had
been
aware
all
the
time
that
he
would
come
and
she
wondered
as
she
always
wondered
at
his
coming
whether
really
she
would
find
him
well
or
whether
this
time
it
had
incredibly
miscarried
and
her
almost
unbearable
joy
became
suspense
became
vehement
desire
to
see
him
and
gather
from
his
face
whether
this
time
also
it
had
worked
how
are
you
how
have
you
been
was
her
question
when
he
stood
before
her
in
her
white
room
holding
her
hand
for
an
instant
tremendously
fit
he
answered
ever
since
i
last
saw
you
oh
seeing
me
it
was
as
if
she
wanted
him
to
know
that
seeing
her
made
no
difference
she
looked
at
him
and
received
her
certainty
she
saw
him
and
young
younger
than
he
was
his
clean
bronzed
face
set
as
it
used
to
be
in
a
firmness
that
obliterated
the
lines
the
little
agonized
lines
that
had
made
her
heart
ache
it
always
does
me
good
he
said
to
see
you
and
to
see
you
you
know
what
it
does
to
me
he
thought
he
knew
as
he
caught
back
his
breath
and
looked
at
her
taking
in
again
her
fine
whiteness
and
her
tenderness
her
purity
of
line
and
the
secret
of
her
eyes
whose
colour
if
they
had
colour
he
was
never
sure
about
taking
in
all
of
her
from
her
adorable
feet
to
her
hair
vividly
dark
that
sprang
from
the
white
parting
like
was
it
like
waves
or
wings
what
had
once
touched
and
moved
him
unspeakably
in
agatha
face
was
the
capacity
it
had
latent
in
its
tragic
lines
for
expressing
terror
terror
was
what
he
most
dreaded
for
her
what
he
had
most
tried
to
keep
her
from
to
keep
out
of
her
face
and
latterly
he
had
not
found
it
or
rather
he
had
not
found
the
unborn
lurking
spirit
of
it
there
it
had
gone
that
little
tragic
droop
in
agatha
face
the
corners
of
her
eyes
and
of
her
beautiful
mouth
were
lifted
as
if
by
he
could
find
no
other
word
for
the
thing
he
meant
but
wings
she
had
a
look
which
if
it
were
not
of
joy
was
of
something
more
vivid
and
positive
than
peace
he
put
it
down
to
their
increased
and
undisturbed
communion
made
possible
by
her
retirement
to
sarratt
end
yet
as
he
looked
at
her
he
sighed
again
in
response
to
his
sigh
she
asked
suddenly
how
bella
his
face
lighted
wonderfully
it
extraordinary
he
said
better
miles
better
in
fact
if
it
was
not
tempting
providence
i
should
say
she
was
well
she
been
for
the
last
week
anyhow
a
perfect
angel
his
amazed
uncomprehending
look
gave
her
the
clue
to
what
had
happened
it
was
another
instance
of
the
astounding
and
mysterious
way
it
worked
she
must
have
got
at
bella
somehow
in
getting
at
him
she
saw
now
no
end
to
the
possibilities
of
the
thing
there
was
anything
so
wonderful
in
making
him
what
after
all
he
was
but
if
she
bella
had
been
even
for
a
week
a
perfect
angel
it
had
made
her
what
she
was
not
and
never
had
been
his
next
utterance
came
to
her
with
no
irrelevance
you
been
found
out
for
a
moment
she
wondered
had
he
guessed
it
then
her
secret
he
had
never
known
anything
about
it
and
it
was
not
likely
that
he
should
know
now
he
was
indeed
very
far
from
knowing
when
he
could
think
that
it
was
seeing
her
that
did
it
there
was
of
course
the
other
secret
the
fact
that
he
did
see
her
but
she
had
never
allowed
that
it
was
a
secret
or
that
it
need
be
although
they
guarded
it
so
carefully
anybody
except
bella
who
would
understand
it
was
welcome
to
know
that
he
came
to
see
her
he
must
mean
that
found
out
she
repeated
if
you
have
been
you
will
be
you
mean
she
said
sarratt
end
has
been
found
out
if
you
put
it
that
way
i
saw
the
powells
at
the
station
she
breathed
freely
they
told
me
they
taken
rooms
at
some
farm
here
which
farm
he
did
remember
was
it
woodman
farm
she
asked
and
he
said
yes
that
was
the
name
they
told
him
whereabouts
was
it
do
you
know
she
said
that
the
name
of
farm
he
had
not
known
it
and
was
visibly
annoyed
at
knowing
it
now
and
agatha
herself
felt
some
dismay
if
it
had
been
any
other
place
but
woodman
farm
it
stared
at
them
it
watched
them
it
knew
all
their
goings
out
and
their
comings
in
it
knew
rodney
not
that
that
had
mattered
in
the
least
but
the
powells
when
they
came
would
know
too
she
tried
to
look
as
if
that
did
matter
either
while
they
faced
each
other
in
a
silence
a
curious
unfamiliar
discomposure
she
recovered
first
after
all
she
said
why
should
they
well
i
thought
you
were
going
to
tell
people
her
face
mounted
a
sudden
flame
a
signal
of
resentment
she
had
always
resented
the
imputation
of
secrecy
in
their
relations
and
now
it
was
as
if
he
were
dragging
forward
the
thought
that
she
perpetually
put
away
from
her
tell
about
what
she
asked
coldly
about
sarratt
end
i
thought
we
agreed
to
keep
it
for
ourselves
i
have
told
everybody
but
i
did
tell
milly
powell
my
dear
girl
that
was
very
clever
of
you
i
told
her
not
to
tell
she
knows
what
i
want
to
be
alone
for
good
god
as
he
stared
in
dismay
at
what
he
judged
to
be
her
unspeakable
indiscretion
the
thought
rushed
in
on
her
straight
from
him
the
naked
terrible
thought
that
there
be
anything
they
had
to
hide
they
had
to
be
alone
for
she
saw
at
the
same
time
how
defenceless
he
was
before
it
he
could
keep
it
back
he
could
put
it
away
from
him
it
was
always
with
him
a
danger
watching
on
his
threshold
then
he
made
her
face
it
with
him
we
done
for
no
no
she
cried
how
could
you
think
that
it
was
another
thing
something
that
i
trying
to
do
you
told
her
he
insisted
what
did
you
tell
her
that
i
doing
it
that
i
here
for
my
health
she
understands
it
that
way
he
smiled
as
if
he
were
satisfied
knowing
her
so
well
and
still
his
thought
his
terrible
naked
thought
was
there
it
was
looking
at
her
straight
out
of
his
eyes
are
you
sure
she
understands
he
said
yes
absolutely
he
hesitated
and
then
put
it
differently
are
you
sure
she
does
understand
that
she
has
an
inkling
was
sure
whether
agatha
understood
whether
she
realised
the
danger
about
you
and
me
he
said
ah
my
dear
i
kept
secret
she
does
know
we
know
each
other
and
if
she
did
she
finished
it
with
a
wonderful
look
a
look
of
unblinking
yet
vaguely
pitifully
uncandid
candour
she
had
always
met
him
and
would
always
have
to
meet
him
with
the
idea
that
there
was
nothing
in
it
for
if
she
once
admitted
that
there
was
anything
then
they
done
for
she
could
how
could
she
let
him
keep
on
coming
with
that
thought
in
him
acknowledged
by
them
both
that
was
where
she
came
in
and
where
her
secret
her
gift
would
work
now
more
beneficently
than
ever
the
beauty
of
it
was
that
it
would
make
them
safe
absolutely
safe
she
had
only
got
to
apply
it
to
that
thought
of
his
and
the
thought
would
not
exist
since
she
could
get
at
him
she
could
do
for
him
what
he
poor
dear
could
not
perhaps
always
do
for
himself
she
could
keep
that
dreadful
possibility
in
him
under
she
could
in
fact
make
their
communion
all
that
she
most
wanted
it
to
be
i
do
like
it
he
said
miserably
i
do
like
it
a
little
line
of
worry
was
coming
in
his
face
again
the
door
opened
and
a
maid
began
to
go
in
and
out
laying
the
table
for
their
meal
he
watched
the
door
close
on
her
and
said
wo
that
woman
wonder
what
i
come
for
she
can
see
what
you
come
for
she
smiled
why
are
you
spoiling
it
with
thinking
things
it
for
you
i
think
them
i
do
mind
it
does
matter
so
much
for
me
but
i
want
you
to
be
safe
oh
safe
my
dear
she
answered
you
were
and
you
would
be
still
if
these
powells
had
found
you
out
he
meditated
what
do
you
suppose
come
for
he
asked
they
come
i
imagine
for
his
health
what
to
a
place
like
this
they
know
what
it
done
for
me
so
they
think
poor
darlings
perhaps
it
may
do
something
even
yet
for
him
what
the
matter
with
him
something
dreadful
and
they
say
incurable
it
is
he
paused
i
ca
tell
you
what
it
is
it
is
anything
you
think
it
was
it
is
anything
bodily
i
never
knew
it
you
not
supposed
to
know
and
you
would
unless
you
know
and
please
you
do
you
do
know
anything
he
smiled
no
you
have
told
me
have
you
i
only
told
you
because
you
never
tell
things
and
because
because
he
waited
smiling
because
i
wanted
you
to
see
he
does
count
well
but
all
right
i
take
it
at
first
she
failed
to
grasp
his
implication
that
if
owing
to
his
affliction
harding
powell
did
count
milly
his
young
wife
did
her
faculties
of
observation
and
of
inference
would
he
took
it
be
unimpaired
wonder
wo
she
he
expounded
about
us
not
she
she
too
much
wrapped
up
in
him
to
notice
anyone
and
he
oh
my
dear
he
too
much
wrapped
up
in
another
anxiety
then
came
to
him
i
say
you
know
he
is
dangerous
is
he
she
laughed
dangerous
oh
dear
me
no
a
lamb
chapter
two
she
kept
on
saying
to
herself
why
should
they
come
what
difference
did
it
make
up
till
now
she
had
not
admitted
that
anything
could
make
a
difference
that
anything
could
touch
could
alter
by
a
shade
the
safe
the
intangible
the
unique
relation
between
her
and
rodney
it
was
proof
against
anything
that
anybody
could
think
and
the
powells
were
not
given
to
thinking
things
agatha
own
mind
had
been
a
crystal
without
a
flaw
in
its
clearness
its
sincerity
it
had
to
be
to
ensure
the
blessed
working
of
the
gift
as
again
it
was
by
the
blessed
working
of
the
gift
that
she
had
kept
it
so
she
could
only
think
of
that
the
secret
the
gift
the
inexpressible
thing
as
itself
a
flawless
crystal
a
charmed
circle
or
rather
as
a
sphere
that
held
all
the
charmed
circles
that
you
draw
round
things
to
keep
them
safe
to
keep
them
holy
she
had
drawn
her
circle
round
rodney
lanyon
and
herself
nobody
could
break
it
they
were
supernaturally
safe
and
yet
the
presence
of
the
powells
had
made
a
difference
she
was
forced
to
own
that
though
she
remained
untouched
it
had
made
a
difference
in
him
it
was
as
if
in
the
agitation
produced
by
them
he
had
brushed
aside
some
veil
and
had
let
her
see
something
that
up
till
now
her
crystal
vision
had
refused
to
see
something
that
was
more
than
a
lurking
possibility
she
discovered
in
him
a
desire
an
intention
that
up
till
now
he
had
concealed
from
her
it
had
left
its
hiding
place
it
rose
on
terrifying
wings
and
fluttered
before
her
troubling
her
she
was
reminded
that
though
there
were
no
lurking
possibilities
in
her
with
him
it
might
be
different
for
him
the
tie
between
them
might
come
to
mean
something
that
it
had
never
meant
and
could
not
mean
for
her
something
that
she
had
refused
not
only
to
see
but
to
foresee
and
provide
for
she
was
aware
of
a
certain
relief
when
monday
came
and
he
had
left
her
without
any
further
unveilings
and
revealings
she
was
even
glad
when
about
the
middle
of
the
week
the
powells
came
with
a
of
luggage
and
settled
at
the
farm
she
said
to
herself
that
they
would
take
her
mind
off
him
they
had
a
way
of
seizing
on
her
and
holding
her
attention
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
objects
she
could
hardly
not
have
been
seized
and
held
by
a
case
so
pitiful
so
desperate
as
theirs
how
pitiful
and
desperate
it
had
become
she
learned
almost
at
once
from
the
face
of
her
friend
the
little
wife
whose
small
flat
features
were
washed
out
and
worn
fine
by
watchings
and
listenings
on
the
border
on
the
threshold
yes
he
was
worse
he
had
had
to
give
up
his
business
harding
powell
was
a
gentle
stockbroker
it
was
any
longer
milly
powell
intimated
a
question
of
borders
and
of
thresholds
they
had
passed
all
that
he
had
gone
clean
over
he
was
in
the
dreadful
interior
and
she
the
resolute
and
vigilant
little
woman
had
no
longer
any
power
to
get
him
out
she
was
at
the
end
of
her
tether
agatha
knew
what
he
had
been
for
years
well
he
was
worse
than
that
far
worse
than
he
had
been
ever
not
so
bad
though
that
he
intervals
in
which
he
knew
how
bad
he
was
and
was
willing
to
do
everything
to
try
anything
they
were
going
to
try
sarratt
end
it
was
her
idea
she
knew
how
marvellously
it
had
answered
with
dear
agatha
not
that
agatha
ever
was
or
could
be
where
was
poor
darling
and
besides
agatha
herself
was
an
attraction
it
had
occurred
to
milly
powell
that
it
might
do
harding
good
to
be
near
agatha
there
was
something
about
her
milly
did
know
what
it
was
but
she
felt
it
felt
it
an
influence
or
something
that
made
for
mental
peace
it
was
powell
said
as
if
she
had
some
secret
she
hoped
agatha
would
mind
it
could
possibly
hurt
her
could
the
darling
could
hurt
a
fly
he
could
only
hurt
himself
and
if
he
got
really
bad
why
then
of
course
they
would
have
to
leave
sarratt
end
he
would
have
she
said
sadly
to
go
away
somewhere
but
not
yet
oh
not
yet
he
was
bad
enough
for
that
she
would
keep
him
with
her
up
to
the
last
possible
moment
the
last
possible
moment
agatha
could
understand
could
she
agatha
did
indeed
milly
powell
smiled
her
desperate
white
smile
and
went
on
always
with
her
air
of
appeal
to
agatha
that
was
why
she
wanted
to
be
near
her
it
was
awful
not
to
be
near
somebody
who
understood
who
would
understand
him
for
agatha
would
understand
would
she
that
to
a
certain
extent
he
must
be
given
in
to
apart
from
agatha
was
why
they
had
chosen
sarratt
end
it
was
the
sort
of
place
was
it
where
you
would
go
if
you
did
want
people
to
get
at
you
where
milly
very
voice
became
furtive
as
she
explained
it
you
could
hide
his
idea
his
last
seemed
to
be
that
something
trying
to
get
at
him
no
not
people
something
worse
something
terrible
it
was
always
after
him
the
most
piteous
thing
about
him
piteous
but
adorable
was
that
he
came
to
her
to
imploring
her
to
hide
him
and
so
she
had
hidden
him
here
agatha
took
in
her
friend
high
courage
as
she
looked
at
the
eyes
where
fright
barely
fluttered
under
the
poised
suspense
she
approved
of
the
plan
it
appealed
to
her
by
its
sheer
audacity
she
murmured
that
if
there
were
anything
that
she
could
do
milly
had
only
to
come
to
her
oh
well
milly
come
what
she
wanted
agatha
to
do
if
she
saw
him
and
he
should
say
anything
about
it
was
simply
to
take
the
line
that
he
was
safe
agatha
said
that
was
the
line
she
did
take
she
was
going
to
let
herself
think
and
milly
must
think
not
for
a
moment
that
he
was
that
there
was
anything
to
be
afraid
of
anything
to
be
afraid
of
that
my
point
said
milly
mine
is
that
here
or
anywhere
wherever
is
there
must
be
any
fear
how
can
he
get
better
if
we
keep
him
wrapped
in
it
you
afraid
you
afraid
persistent
invincible
affirmation
was
part
of
her
method
her
secret
milly
replied
a
little
wearily
she
knew
nothing
about
the
method
i
have
time
to
be
afraid
she
said
and
as
long
as
you
not
it
you
who
matter
agatha
cried
you
so
near
him
do
you
realise
what
it
means
to
be
so
near
milly
smiled
sadly
tenderly
as
if
she
did
know
my
dear
that
all
that
keeps
me
going
i
got
to
make
him
feel
that
he
protected
he
protected
said
agatha
already
she
was
drawing
her
charmed
circle
round
him
as
long
as
i
hold
out
if
i
give
in
he
done
for
you
must
think
it
you
must
say
it
but
i
know
it
oh
my
dear
i
all
he
got
at
that
she
looked
for
a
moment
as
if
she
might
break
down
she
said
the
terrible
part
of
it
was
that
they
were
left
so
much
alone
people
were
beginning
to
shrink
from
him
to
be
afraid
of
him
you
know
said
agatha
i
not
you
must
bring
him
to
see
me
the
little
woman
had
risen
as
she
said
to
go
to
him
she
stood
there
visibly
hesitating
she
could
bring
him
he
would
come
would
agatha
go
with
her
and
see
him
agatha
went
as
they
approached
the
farm
she
saw
to
her
amazement
that
the
door
was
shut
and
the
blinds
the
ugly
ochreish
yellow
blinds
were
down
in
all
the
nine
windows
of
the
front
the
windows
of
the
powell
rooms
the
house
was
like
a
house
of
the
dead
do
you
get
the
sun
on
this
side
she
said
and
as
she
said
it
she
realised
the
stupidity
of
her
question
for
the
nine
windows
looked
to
the
east
and
the
sun
wheeling
down
the
west
had
been
in
their
faces
as
they
came
milly
answered
mechanically
no
we
do
get
any
sun
she
added
with
an
irrelevance
that
was
only
apparent
i
had
to
take
all
four
rooms
to
keep
other
people
out
they
never
come
said
agatha
no
said
milly
but
if
they
did
the
front
door
was
locked
milly
had
the
key
when
they
had
entered
agatha
saw
her
turn
it
in
the
lock
again
slowly
and
without
a
sound
all
the
doors
were
shut
in
the
passage
and
it
was
dark
there
milly
opened
a
door
on
the
left
at
the
foot
of
the
steep
stairs
he
will
be
in
here
she
said
the
large
room
was
lit
with
a
thick
ochreish
light
through
the
squares
of
its
drawn
blinds
it
ran
the
whole
width
of
the
house
and
had
a
third
window
looking
west
where
the
yellow
light
prevailed
a
horrible
light
it
was
it
cast
thin
turbid
brown
shadows
on
the
walls
harding
powell
was
sitting
between
the
drawn
blinds
alone
in
the
black
hollow
of
the
chimney
place
he
crouched
in
his
chair
and
his
bowed
back
was
towards
them
as
they
stood
there
on
the
threshold
harding
said
milly
agatha
has
come
to
see
you
he
turned
in
his
chair
and
rose
as
they
entered
his
chin
was
sunk
on
his
chest
and
the
first
thing
agatha
noticed
was
the
difficult
slow
movement
with
which
he
lifted
it
his
eyes
seemed
to
come
up
last
of
all
from
the
depths
to
meet
her
with
a
peculiar
foreign
courtesy
he
bowed
his
head
again
over
her
hand
as
he
held
it
he
apologised
for
the
darkness
in
which
they
found
him
harding
manners
had
always
been
perfect
and
it
struck
agatha
as
strange
and
pathetic
that
his
malady
should
have
left
untouched
the
incomparable
quality
he
had
milly
went
to
the
windows
and
drew
the
blinds
up
the
light
revealed
him
in
his
exquisite
perfection
his
small
fragile
finish
he
was
fifty
or
thereabouts
but
slight
as
a
boy
and
nervous
and
dark
as
englishmen
are
dark
jaw
and
chin
shaven
his
mouth
hidden
by
the
straight
droop
of
his
moustache
from
the
eyes
downwards
the
outlines
of
his
face
and
features
were
of
an
extreme
regularity
and
a
fineness
undestroyed
by
the
work
of
the
strained
nerves
on
the
sallow
delicate
texture
but
his
eyes
dark
like
an
animal
were
the
eyes
of
a
terrified
thing
a
thing
hunted
and
on
the
watch
a
thing
that
listened
continually
for
the
soft
feet
of
the
hunter
above
these
eyes
his
brows
were
twisted
were
tortured
with
his
terror
he
turned
to
his
wife
did
you
lock
the
door
dear
he
said
i
did
but
you
know
harding
we
need
here
he
shivered
slightly
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
before
the
when
he
had
his
back
to
milly
milly
followed
him
with
her
eyes
of
anguish
when
he
turned
and
faced
her
she
met
him
with
her
white
smile
presently
he
spoke
again
he
wondered
whether
they
would
object
to
his
drawing
the
blinds
down
he
was
afraid
he
would
have
to
otherwise
he
said
would
be
milly
laid
her
hand
on
the
arm
that
he
stretched
towards
the
window
darling
she
said
you
forgotten
you
ca
possibly
be
seen
here
it
just
the
one
place
is
it
agatha
where
you
be
her
eyes
signalled
to
agatha
to
support
her
not
but
what
she
had
perfect
confidence
in
the
plan
it
was
agatha
assented
and
agatha
knows
said
milly
he
shivered
again
he
had
turned
to
agatha
forgive
me
if
i
suggest
that
you
can
not
really
know
heaven
forbid
that
you
know
milly
intent
on
her
plan
persisted
but
dearest
you
said
yourself
it
was
the
one
place
said
that
when
did
i
say
it
yesterday
yesterday
i
daresay
but
i
did
sleep
last
night
it
would
let
me
very
few
people
do
sleep
said
agatha
for
the
first
time
in
a
strange
place
the
place
is
strange
that
what
i
complain
of
that
what
keeps
me
awake
no
place
ever
will
be
strange
when
it
there
and
it
was
there
last
night
darling
milly
murmured
you
know
what
i
mean
he
said
the
thing
that
keeps
me
awake
of
course
if
i
slept
last
night
i
have
known
it
was
there
but
when
i
did
sleep
he
left
it
to
them
to
draw
the
only
possible
conclusion
they
dropped
the
subject
they
turned
to
other
things
and
talked
a
little
while
sitting
with
him
in
his
room
with
the
drawn
blinds
from
time
to
time
when
they
appealed
to
him
he
gave
an
urbane
assent
a
murmur
a
suave
motion
of
his
hand
when
the
light
went
they
lit
a
lamp
agatha
stayed
and
dined
with
them
that
being
the
best
thing
she
could
do
at
nine
she
rose
and
said
to
harding
powell
he
smiled
a
drawn
smile
ah
if
i
could
sleep
he
said
that
the
worst
of
it
his
not
sleeping
said
milly
at
the
gate
he
will
sleep
he
will
sleep
said
agatha
milly
sighed
she
knew
he
would
the
plan
she
said
was
no
good
after
all
it
would
work
chapter
three
how
could
it
there
was
nothing
behind
it
all
milly
plans
had
been
like
that
they
fell
to
dust
they
dust
they
had
been
always
that
pitiful
desperate
stirring
of
the
dust
to
hide
the
terror
the
futile
throwing
of
the
dust
in
the
poor
thing
eyes
as
if
he
see
through
it
as
if
with
the
supernatural
lucidity
the
invincible
cunning
of
the
insane
he
did
see
through
anything
and
provide
for
it
it
was
really
only
his
indestructible
urbanity
persisting
through
the
wreck
of
him
that
bore
tolerantly
temperately
with
milly
and
her
plans
without
it
he
might
be
dangerous
with
it
as
long
as
it
lasted
little
milly
plan
as
she
would
was
safe
but
they
could
count
on
its
lasting
agatha
had
realised
that
from
the
moment
when
she
had
seen
him
draw
down
the
blind
again
after
his
wife
had
drawn
it
up
that
was
the
maddest
thing
he
had
done
yet
she
had
shuddered
at
it
as
at
an
act
of
violence
it
outraged
cruelly
his
exquisite
quality
it
was
so
unlike
him
she
was
not
sure
that
milly
had
even
made
things
worse
by
her
latest
plan
the
flight
to
sarratt
end
it
emphasised
the
fact
that
they
were
flying
that
they
had
to
fly
it
had
brought
her
to
the
house
with
the
drawn
blinds
in
the
closed
barred
valley
to
the
end
of
the
world
to
the
end
of
her
tether
and
when
she
realised
that
it
the
end
when
he
realised
it
agatha
could
leave
him
there
she
could
when
she
had
the
secret
leave
him
to
poor
milly
and
her
plans
that
had
been
in
her
mind
when
she
had
insisted
on
it
that
he
would
sleep
she
knew
what
milly
meant
by
her
sigh
and
the
look
she
gave
her
if
milly
could
have
been
impolite
she
would
have
told
her
that
it
was
all
very
well
to
say
so
but
how
were
they
going
to
make
him
and
she
too
felt
that
something
more
was
required
of
her
than
that
irritating
affirmation
she
had
got
to
make
him
his
case
his
piteous
case
cried
out
for
an
extension
of
the
gift
she
had
any
doubt
as
to
its
working
there
were
things
she
know
about
it
yet
but
she
was
sure
of
that
she
had
proved
it
by
a
hundred
experimental
intermissions
abstentions
and
recoveries
in
order
to
be
sure
you
had
only
to
let
go
and
see
how
you
got
on
without
it
she
had
tried
in
that
way
with
scepticism
and
precaution
on
herself
but
not
in
the
beginning
she
could
not
say
that
she
had
tried
it
in
the
beginning
at
all
even
on
herself
it
had
simply
come
to
her
as
she
put
it
by
a
divine
accident
heaven
knew
she
had
needed
it
she
had
been
like
rodney
lanyon
on
the
verge
where
he
poor
dear
had
brought
her
so
impossible
had
it
been
then
to
bear
her
knowledge
and
what
was
worse
her
divination
of
the
things
he
bore
from
bella
it
was
her
divination
her
compassion
that
had
wrecked
her
as
she
stood
aside
cut
off
from
him
he
on
the
verge
and
she
near
it
looking
on
powerless
to
help
while
bella
tore
at
him
talk
of
the
verge
the
wonder
was
they
had
gone
clean
over
it
both
of
them
she
could
say
then
from
what
region
what
tract
of
unexplored
incredible
mystery
her
help
had
come
it
came
one
day
one
night
when
she
was
at
her
worst
she
remembered
how
with
some
resurgent
ultimate
instinct
of
surrender
she
had
sunk
on
the
floor
of
her
room
flung
out
her
arms
across
the
bed
in
the
supreme
gesture
of
supplication
and
thus
gone
eyes
shut
and
with
no
motion
of
thought
or
sense
in
her
clean
into
the
blackness
where
as
if
it
had
been
waiting
for
her
the
thing
had
found
her
it
had
found
her
agatha
was
precise
on
that
point
she
had
not
found
it
she
had
not
even
stumbled
on
it
blundered
up
against
it
in
the
blackness
the
way
it
worked
the
wonder
of
her
instantaneous
had
been
the
first
the
very
first
hint
she
had
that
it
was
there
she
had
never
quite
recaptured
her
primal
virgin
sense
of
it
but
to
set
against
that
she
had
entered
more
and
more
into
possession
she
had
found
out
the
secret
of
its
working
and
had
controlled
it
reduced
it
to
an
almost
intelligible
method
you
could
think
of
it
as
a
current
of
transcendent
power
hitherto
mysteriously
inhibited
you
made
the
connection
having
cut
off
all
other
currents
that
interfered
and
then
you
simply
turned
it
on
in
other
words
if
you
could
put
it
into
words
at
all
you
shut
your
eyes
and
ears
you
closed
up
the
sense
of
touch
you
made
everything
dark
around
you
and
withdrew
into
your
innermost
self
you
burrowed
deep
into
the
darkness
there
till
you
got
beyond
it
you
tapped
the
power
as
it
were
underground
at
any
point
you
pleased
and
turned
it
on
in
any
direction
she
could
turn
it
on
to
harding
powell
without
any
loss
to
rodney
lanyon
for
it
was
immeasurable
inexhaustible
she
looked
back
at
the
with
its
veiled
windows
formless
and
immense
the
shadow
of
harding
powell
swayed
uneasily
on
one
of
the
yellow
blinds
across
the
field
her
own
house
showed
pure
and
dim
against
the
darkening
slope
behind
it
showed
a
washed
and
watered
white
in
the
liquid
lucid
twilight
her
house
was
open
always
and
on
every
side
it
flung
out
its
casement
arms
to
the
night
and
to
the
day
and
now
all
the
lamps
were
lit
every
doorway
was
a
golden
shaft
every
window
a
golden
square
the
whiteness
of
its
walls
quivered
and
the
blurred
edges
flowed
into
the
dark
of
the
garden
it
was
the
fragile
shell
of
a
sacred
and
a
burning
light
she
did
not
go
in
all
at
once
she
crossed
the
river
and
went
up
the
hill
through
the
she
walked
there
every
evening
in
the
darkness
calling
her
thoughts
home
to
sleep
the
easter
moon
and
holy
looked
down
at
her
shrined
under
the
long
sharp
arch
of
the
it
was
like
going
up
and
up
towards
a
dim
sanctuary
where
the
holiest
sat
enthroned
a
sense
of
consecration
was
upon
her
it
came
solemn
and
pure
and
still
out
of
the
tumult
of
her
tenderness
and
pity
but
it
was
too
awful
for
pity
and
for
tenderness
it
aspired
like
a
flame
and
lost
itself
in
light
it
grew
like
a
wave
till
it
was
vaster
than
any
tenderness
or
any
pity
it
was
as
if
her
heart
rose
on
the
swell
of
it
and
was
carried
away
into
a
rhythm
so
tremendous
that
her
own
pulses
of
compassion
were
no
longer
felt
or
felt
only
as
the
hushed
and
delicate
vibration
of
the
wave
she
recognised
her
state
it
was
the
blessed
state
desired
as
the
condition
of
the
working
of
the
gift
she
turned
when
the
last
arch
of
the
broke
and
opened
to
the
sky
at
the
top
of
the
hill
where
the
moon
hung
in
immensity
free
of
her
hill
free
of
the
shrine
that
held
her
she
went
down
with
slow
soft
footsteps
as
if
she
carried
herself
her
whole
fragile
being
as
a
vessel
a
crystal
vessel
for
the
holy
thing
and
was
careful
lest
a
touch
of
the
earth
should
jar
and
break
her
chapter
four
she
went
still
more
gently
and
with
eyes
through
her
illuminated
house
she
turned
the
lights
out
in
her
room
and
undressed
herself
in
the
darkness
she
laid
herself
on
the
bed
with
straight
lax
limbs
with
arms
held
apart
a
little
from
her
body
with
eyelids
shut
lightly
on
her
eyes
all
fleshly
contacts
were
diminished
it
was
now
as
if
her
being
drank
at
every
pore
the
swimming
darkness
as
if
the
rhythm
of
her
heart
and
of
her
breath
had
ceased
in
the
pulse
of
its
invasion
she
sank
in
it
and
was
covered
with
wave
upon
wave
of
darkness
she
sank
and
was
upheld
she
dissolved
and
was
gathered
together
again
a
flawless
crystal
she
was
herself
the
heart
of
the
charmed
circle
poised
in
the
ultimate
unspeakable
stillness
beyond
death
beyond
birth
beyond
the
movements
the
vehemences
the
agitations
of
the
world
she
drew
harding
powell
into
it
and
held
him
there
to
draw
him
to
any
purpose
she
had
first
to
loosen
and
destroy
the
fleshly
sinister
image
of
him
that
for
the
moment
of
evocation
hung
like
a
picture
on
the
darkness
in
a
moment
the
fleshly
image
receded
it
sank
back
into
the
darkness
his
name
harding
powell
was
now
the
only
earthly
sign
of
him
that
she
suffered
to
appear
in
the
third
moment
his
name
was
blotted
out
and
then
it
was
as
if
she
drew
him
by
intangible
supersensible
threads
she
touched
with
no
sense
of
peril
his
innermost
essence
the
walls
of
flesh
were
down
between
them
she
had
got
at
him
and
having
got
at
him
she
held
him
a
bloodless
spirit
a
bodiless
essence
in
the
fount
of
healing
she
said
to
herself
he
will
sleep
now
he
will
sleep
he
will
sleep
and
as
she
slid
into
her
own
sleep
she
held
and
drew
him
with
her
he
would
sleep
he
would
be
all
right
as
long
as
slept
her
sleep
she
had
discovered
did
more
than
carry
on
the
amazing
act
of
communion
and
redemption
it
clinched
it
it
was
the
seal
on
the
bond
early
the
next
morning
she
went
over
to
the
farm
the
blinds
were
up
the
doors
and
windows
were
flung
open
milly
met
her
at
the
garden
gate
she
stopped
her
and
walked
a
little
way
with
her
across
the
field
worked
she
said
it
worked
after
all
like
magic
for
a
moment
agatha
wondered
whether
milly
had
guessed
anything
whether
she
divined
the
secret
and
had
brought
him
there
for
that
and
had
refused
to
acknowledge
it
before
she
knew
what
has
she
asked
the
plan
the
place
he
slept
last
night
ten
hours
straight
on
end
i
know
for
i
stayed
awake
and
watched
him
and
this
morning
oh
my
dear
if
you
could
see
him
he
all
right
he
all
right
and
you
think
said
agatha
it
the
place
milly
knew
nothing
guessed
divined
nothing
why
what
else
can
it
be
she
said
what
does
think
he
does
think
he
ca
account
for
it
he
says
himself
miraculous
perhaps
said
agatha
it
is
they
were
silent
a
moment
over
the
wonder
of
it
i
ca
get
over
it
said
milly
presently
it
so
odd
that
it
should
make
all
that
difference
i
could
understand
it
if
it
had
worked
that
way
at
first
but
it
did
think
of
him
yesterday
and
yet
if
it
is
the
place
what
is
it
what
is
it
agatha
did
not
answer
she
was
going
to
tell
milly
what
it
was
if
she
did
milly
would
believe
her
and
milly
unbelief
might
work
against
it
it
might
prove
for
all
she
knew
an
inimical
disastrous
power
come
and
see
for
yourself
milly
spoke
as
if
it
had
been
agatha
who
doubted
they
turned
again
towards
the
house
powell
had
come
out
and
was
in
the
garden
leaning
on
the
gate
they
could
see
how
right
he
was
by
the
mere
fact
of
his
being
there
presenting
himself
like
that
to
the
vivid
light
he
opened
the
gate
for
them
raising
his
hat
and
smiling
as
they
came
his
face
witnessed
to
the
wonder
worked
on
him
the
colour
showed
clean
purged
of
his
taint
his
eyes
were
candid
and
pure
under
brows
smoothed
by
sleep
as
they
went
in
he
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
open
doorway
and
looked
at
the
view
admiring
the
river
and
the
green
valley
and
the
bare
upland
fields
under
the
wood
he
had
always
had
it
was
part
of
his
rare
quality
a
prodigious
capacity
for
admiration
my
god
he
said
how
beautiful
the
world
is
he
looked
at
milly
and
all
is
a
patch
on
my
wife
he
looked
at
her
with
tenderness
and
admiration
and
the
look
was
the
flower
the
perfection
of
his
sanity
milly
drew
in
her
breath
with
a
little
sound
like
a
sob
her
joy
was
so
great
that
it
was
almost
unbearable
then
he
looked
at
agatha
and
admired
the
green
gown
she
wore
you
know
he
said
how
exquisitely
right
you
are
she
smiled
she
knew
how
exquisitely
right
was
chapter
five
night
after
night
she
continued
and
without
an
effort
it
was
as
easy
as
drawing
your
breath
it
was
indeed
the
breath
you
drew
she
found
that
she
had
no
longer
to
devote
hours
to
harding
powell
any
more
than
she
gave
hours
to
rodney
she
could
do
his
business
in
moments
in
points
of
inappreciable
time
it
was
as
if
from
night
to
night
the
times
swung
together
and
made
one
enduring
timeless
time
for
the
process
belonged
to
a
region
that
was
not
of
times
or
time
she
was
afraid
then
of
not
giving
enough
time
to
it
but
she
afraid
of
omitting
it
altogether
she
knew
that
every
intermission
would
be
followed
by
a
relapse
and
harding
state
did
not
admit
of
any
relapses
of
course
if
time
counted
if
the
thing
was
measurable
she
would
have
been
afraid
of
losing
hold
of
rodney
lanyon
she
held
him
now
by
a
single
slender
thread
and
the
thread
was
bella
she
worked
it
regularly
now
through
bella
he
was
bound
to
be
all
right
as
long
as
bella
was
for
his
possibilities
of
suffering
were
thus
cut
off
at
their
source
besides
it
was
the
only
way
to
preserve
the
purity
of
her
intention
the
flawlessness
of
the
crystal
that
was
the
blessedness
of
her
attitude
to
harding
powell
it
was
passionless
impersonal
she
wanted
nothing
of
harding
powell
except
to
help
him
and
to
help
milly
dear
little
milly
and
never
before
had
she
been
given
so
complete
so
overwhelming
a
sense
of
having
helped
it
was
nothing
unless
it
was
a
safeguard
against
vanity
that
they
know
it
that
they
persisted
in
thinking
that
it
was
milly
plan
that
worked
not
that
that
altogether
accounted
for
it
to
harding
powell
he
said
so
at
last
to
agatha
they
were
returning
he
and
she
by
the
edge
of
the
wood
at
the
top
of
the
steep
field
after
a
long
walk
he
had
asked
her
to
go
with
him
it
was
her
country
for
a
good
stretch
further
than
milly
little
feet
could
carry
her
they
stood
a
moment
up
there
and
looked
around
them
april
was
coming
on
but
the
ploughed
land
at
their
feet
was
still
bare
the
earth
waited
on
that
side
of
the
valley
she
was
delicately
unfruitful
spent
with
rearing
the
fine
thin
beauty
of
the
woods
but
down
below
the
valley
ran
over
with
young
grass
and
poured
it
to
the
river
in
wave
after
wave
till
the
last
surge
of
green
rounded
over
the
water
edge
rain
had
fallen
in
the
night
and
the
river
had
risen
it
rested
there
poised
it
was
wonderful
how
a
thing
so
brimming
so
shining
so
alive
could
be
so
still
still
as
marsh
water
flat
to
the
flat
land
at
that
moment
in
a
flash
that
came
like
a
shifting
of
her
eyes
the
world
she
looked
at
suffered
a
change
and
yet
it
did
not
change
all
the
appearances
of
things
their
colours
the
movement
and
the
stillness
remained
as
if
constant
in
their
rhythm
and
their
scale
but
they
were
heightened
intensified
they
were
carried
to
a
pitch
that
would
have
been
vehement
vibrant
but
that
the
stillness
as
well
as
the
movement
was
intense
she
was
not
dazzled
by
it
or
confused
in
any
way
her
senses
were
exalted
adjusted
to
the
pitch
she
would
have
said
now
that
the
earth
at
her
feet
had
become
insubstantial
but
that
she
knew
in
her
flash
that
what
she
saw
was
the
very
substance
of
the
visible
world
live
and
subtle
as
flame
solid
as
crystal
and
as
clean
it
was
the
same
world
flat
field
for
flat
field
and
hill
for
hill
but
radiant
vibrant
and
as
it
were
infinitely
transparent
agatha
in
her
moment
saw
that
the
whole
world
brimmed
and
shone
and
was
alive
with
the
joy
that
was
its
life
joy
that
flowed
and
yet
was
still
in
every
leaf
in
every
blade
of
grass
this
life
was
manifest
as
a
strange
a
divine
translucence
she
was
about
to
point
it
out
to
the
man
at
her
side
when
she
remembered
that
he
had
eyes
for
the
beauty
of
the
earth
but
no
sense
of
its
secret
and
supernatural
light
harding
powell
denied
he
always
had
denied
the
supernatural
and
when
she
turned
to
him
her
vision
had
passed
from
her
they
must
have
another
tramp
some
day
he
said
he
wanted
to
see
more
of
this
wonderful
place
and
then
he
spoke
of
his
recovery
it
all
very
well
he
said
but
i
ca
account
for
it
milly
says
it
the
place
it
a
wonderful
place
said
agatha
not
so
wonderful
as
all
that
you
saw
how
i
was
the
day
after
we
came
well
it
ca
be
the
place
altogether
i
rather
hope
it
is
agatha
said
do
you
what
do
you
think
it
is
then
i
think
it
something
in
you
of
course
of
course
but
what
started
it
that
what
i
want
to
know
something
happened
something
queer
and
spontaneous
and
unaccountable
it
it
uncanny
for
you
know
i
ought
to
feel
like
this
i
got
bad
news
this
morning
bad
news
yes
my
sister
little
girl
is
very
ill
they
think
it
meningitis
they
in
awful
trouble
and
feeling
like
this
do
let
it
distress
you
it
does
distress
me
it
only
puzzles
me
that
the
odd
thing
of
course
i
sorry
and
i
anxious
and
all
that
but
i
so
well
you
well
do
be
morbid
i
have
told
my
wife
yet
about
the
child
i
mean
i
simply
dare
it
frighten
her
she
wo
know
how
i
take
it
and
she
think
it
make
me
go
all
queer
again
he
paused
and
turned
to
her
i
say
if
she
know
how
i
taking
it
she
think
awfully
queer
would
she
he
paused
the
worst
of
it
is
he
said
i
got
to
tell
her
will
you
leave
it
to
me
agatha
said
i
think
i
can
make
it
all
right
how
he
queried
never
mind
how
i
can
well
he
assented
there
hardly
anything
you
ca
do
that
was
how
she
came
to
tell
milly
she
made
up
her
mind
to
tell
her
that
evening
as
they
sat
alone
in
agatha
house
harding
milly
said
was
happy
over
there
with
his
books
just
as
he
used
to
be
only
more
so
so
much
more
so
that
she
was
a
little
disturbed
about
it
she
was
afraid
it
would
last
and
again
she
said
it
was
the
place
the
wonderful
wonderful
place
if
you
want
it
to
last
agatha
said
do
go
on
thinking
it
the
place
why
should
it
be
i
feel
that
he
safe
here
he
out
of
it
things
ca
reach
him
bad
news
reached
him
aggy
what
milly
whispered
in
her
fright
his
sister
is
very
anxious
about
her
little
girl
what
wrong
agatha
repeated
what
she
had
heard
from
harding
powell
oh
milly
was
dumb
for
an
instant
while
she
thought
of
her
then
she
cried
aloud
if
the
child
dies
it
will
make
him
ill
again
no
milly
it
wo
it
will
i
tell
you
it
always
been
that
sort
of
thing
that
does
it
and
supposing
there
was
something
that
keeps
it
off
what
is
there
what
is
there
i
believe
there
something
would
you
mind
awfully
if
it
was
the
place
what
do
you
mean
agatha
there
was
a
faint
resentment
in
agonised
tone
it
was
then
that
agatha
told
her
she
made
it
out
for
her
as
far
as
she
had
made
it
out
at
all
with
the
diffidence
that
a
decent
attitude
required
milly
raised
doubts
which
subsided
in
a
kind
of
awe
when
agatha
faced
her
with
the
evidence
of
dates
you
remember
milly
the
night
when
he
slept
i
do
remember
he
said
himself
it
was
miraculous
she
meditated
and
so
you
think
it
that
she
said
presently
i
do
indeed
if
i
dared
leave
off
i
dare
you
see
for
yourself
what
do
you
think
you
got
hold
of
i
do
know
yet
there
was
a
long
deep
silence
which
milly
broke
what
do
you
she
said
i
do
do
anything
it
is
me
i
see
said
milly
prayed
you
did
think
i
had
it
not
that
not
anything
you
mean
by
it
and
yet
it
is
only
more
much
more
i
ca
explain
it
i
only
know
it
is
me
she
was
beginning
to
feel
vaguely
uncomfortable
about
having
told
her
and
milly
you
must
tell
him
promise
me
you
wo
tell
him
no
i
wo
tell
him
because
you
see
he
think
it
was
all
rot
he
would
said
milly
it
the
sort
of
thing
he
does
think
rot
and
that
might
prevent
its
working
milly
smiled
faintly
i
have
the
ghost
of
an
idea
what
is
but
whatever
it
is
can
you
go
on
doing
it
yes
i
think
so
you
see
it
depends
rather
it
depends
on
what
oh
on
a
lot
of
things
on
your
sincerity
on
your
your
purity
it
depends
so
much
on
that
it
frightens
you
lest
perhaps
you
might
after
all
be
so
very
pure
milly
smiled
again
a
little
differently
darling
if
that
all
not
frightened
only
supposing
supposing
you
gave
out
you
might
you
know
might
but
it
could
you
must
think
it
me
milly
because
if
anything
happened
to
me
if
i
did
give
out
do
you
see
how
it
would
let
him
down
it
as
bad
as
thinking
it
the
place
does
it
matter
what
it
is
or
who
it
is
said
milly
passionately
as
long
as
her
tears
came
and
stopped
her
agatha
divined
the
source
of
milly
passion
then
you
do
mind
milly
you
let
me
go
on
milly
rose
she
turned
abruptly
holding
her
head
high
so
that
she
might
not
spill
her
tears
agatha
went
with
her
over
the
grey
field
towards
the
farm
they
paused
at
the
gate
milly
spoke
are
you
sure
she
said
certain
and
you
wo
leave
go
her
eyes
shone
towards
her
friend
in
the
twilight
you
go
on
must
go
on
ah
how
believing
that
he
be
all
right
oh
aggy
he
was
devoted
to
winny
and
if
the
child
dies
chapter
six
the
child
died
three
days
later
milly
came
over
to
agatha
with
the
news
she
said
it
had
been
an
awful
shock
of
course
she
been
dreading
something
like
that
for
him
but
he
taken
it
wonderfully
if
he
came
out
of
it
all
right
she
believe
in
what
she
called
thing
he
did
come
out
of
it
all
right
his
behaviour
was
the
crowning
proof
if
milly
wanted
more
proof
of
his
sanity
he
went
up
to
london
and
made
all
the
arrangements
for
his
sister
when
he
returned
he
forestalled
milly
specious
consolations
with
the
truth
it
was
better
he
told
her
that
the
dear
little
girl
should
have
died
for
there
was
distinct
brain
trouble
anyway
he
took
it
as
a
sane
man
takes
a
terrible
alternative
weeks
passed
he
had
grown
accustomed
to
his
own
sanity
and
no
longer
marvelled
at
it
and
still
without
intermission
agatha
went
on
she
had
been
so
far
affected
by
milly
fright
that
was
the
worst
of
milly
knowing
that
she
held
on
to
harding
powell
with
a
slightly
exaggerated
intensity
she
even
began
to
give
more
and
more
time
to
him
she
who
had
made
out
that
time
in
this
process
did
not
matter
she
was
afraid
of
letting
go
because
the
consequences
milly
was
perpetually
reminding
her
of
the
consequences
of
letting
go
would
be
awful
for
milly
kept
her
at
it
milly
urged
her
on
milly
in
milly
own
words
sustained
her
she
praised
her
she
praised
the
secret
praised
the
power
she
said
you
could
see
how
it
worked
it
was
tremendous
it
was
inexhaustible
milly
familiarised
with
its
working
had
become
a
fanatical
believer
in
the
power
but
she
had
her
own
theory
she
knew
of
course
that
they
were
all
she
and
agatha
and
poor
harding
dependent
on
the
power
that
it
was
the
power
that
did
it
and
not
agatha
but
agatha
was
one
link
with
it
and
if
the
link
gave
way
where
were
they
agatha
felt
that
milly
watched
her
and
waylaid
her
that
she
was
suspicious
of
failures
and
of
intermissions
that
she
wondered
that
she
peered
and
pried
milly
would
if
she
could
have
stuck
her
fingers
into
what
she
called
the
machinery
of
the
thing
its
vagueness
baffled
and
even
annoyed
her
for
her
mind
was
limited
it
loved
and
was
at
home
with
limits
it
desired
above
all
things
precise
ideas
names
phrases
anything
that
constricted
and
defined
but
still
with
it
all
she
believed
and
the
great
thing
was
that
milly
believe
she
might
have
worked
havoc
if
with
her
temperament
she
had
doubted
what
did
suffer
was
the
fine
poise
with
which
she
agatha
had
held
rodney
lanyon
and
harding
powell
each
by
his
own
thread
milly
had
compelled
her
to
spin
a
stronger
thread
for
harding
and
as
it
were
to
multiply
her
threads
so
as
to
hold
him
at
all
points
and
because
of
this
because
of
giving
more
and
more
time
to
him
she
could
not
always
loose
him
from
her
and
let
him
go
and
she
was
afraid
lest
the
pull
he
had
on
her
might
weaken
rodney
thread
up
till
now
the
powells
third
week
at
sarratt
end
she
had
had
the
assurance
that
his
thread
still
held
she
heard
from
him
that
bella
was
all
right
which
meant
that
he
too
was
all
right
for
there
had
never
been
anything
wrong
with
him
bella
and
she
had
a
further
glimpse
of
the
way
the
gift
worked
its
wonders
three
fridays
had
passed
and
he
had
not
come
well
she
had
meant
that
she
had
tried
on
that
last
friday
of
his
with
a
crystal
sincerity
to
hold
him
back
so
that
he
should
not
come
and
up
till
now
with
an
ease
that
simply
amazed
her
she
had
kept
herself
at
the
highest
pitch
of
her
sincere
and
beautiful
intention
not
that
it
was
the
intention
that
had
failed
her
now
it
had
succeeded
so
beautifully
so
perfectly
that
he
had
no
need
to
come
at
all
she
had
given
bella
back
to
him
she
had
given
him
back
to
bella
only
she
faced
the
full
perfection
of
her
work
she
had
brought
it
to
so
fine
a
point
that
she
would
never
see
him
again
she
had
gone
to
the
root
of
it
she
had
taken
from
him
the
desire
to
see
her
and
now
it
was
as
if
subtly
insidiously
her
relation
to
him
had
become
inverted
whereas
hitherto
it
had
been
she
who
had
been
necessary
to
him
it
seemed
now
that
he
was
far
more
beyond
all
comparison
more
necessary
to
her
after
all
rodney
had
had
bella
and
she
had
nobody
but
rodney
he
was
the
one
solitary
thing
she
cared
for
and
hitherto
it
had
not
mattered
so
immensely
for
all
her
caring
whether
he
came
to
her
or
not
seeing
him
had
been
perhaps
a
small
mortal
joy
but
it
had
not
been
the
tremendous
and
essential
thing
she
had
been
contented
satisfied
beyond
all
mortal
contentments
and
satisfactions
with
the
intangible
immaterial
tie
now
she
longed
with
an
unendurable
longing
for
his
visible
bodily
presence
she
had
not
realised
her
joy
as
long
as
it
was
with
her
she
had
refused
to
acknowledge
it
because
of
its
mortal
quality
and
it
had
raised
no
cry
that
troubled
her
abiding
spiritual
calm
but
now
that
she
had
put
it
from
her
it
thrust
itself
on
her
it
cried
it
clung
piteously
to
her
and
would
not
let
her
go
she
looked
back
to
the
last
year
her
year
of
fridays
and
saw
it
following
her
following
and
entreating
she
looked
forward
and
she
saw
friday
after
friday
coming
upon
her
a
procession
of
pitiless
days
trampling
it
down
her
small
piteous
mortal
joy
and
her
mortality
rose
in
her
and
revolted
she
had
been
disturbed
by
what
she
had
called
the
lurking
possibilities
in
rodney
they
were
nothing
to
the
lurking
possibilities
in
her
there
were
moments
when
her
desire
to
see
rodney
sickened
her
with
its
importunity
each
time
she
beat
it
back
in
an
instant
to
its
burrow
below
the
threshold
and
it
hid
there
it
ran
underground
there
were
ways
below
the
threshold
by
which
desire
could
get
at
him
therefore
one
night
tuesday
of
the
fourth
week
she
cut
him
off
she
refused
to
hold
him
even
by
a
thread
it
was
bella
and
bella
only
that
she
held
now
on
friday
of
that
week
she
heard
from
him
bella
was
still
all
right
but
was
anything
but
he
did
know
what
was
the
matter
with
him
he
supposed
it
was
the
same
old
thing
again
he
could
think
how
poor
bella
stood
him
but
she
did
it
must
be
awfully
bad
for
her
it
was
beastly
was
it
that
he
should
have
got
like
that
just
when
bella
was
so
well
she
might
have
known
it
she
had
in
fact
known
having
once
held
him
and
having
healed
him
she
had
no
right
as
long
as
the
power
consented
to
work
through
her
she
had
no
right
to
let
him
go
she
began
again
from
the
beginning
from
the
first
process
of
purification
and
surrender
but
what
followed
was
different
now
she
had
not
only
to
recapture
the
crystal
serenity
the
holiness
of
that
state
by
which
she
had
held
rodney
lanyon
and
had
healed
him
she
had
to
recover
the
poise
by
which
she
had
held
him
and
harding
powell
together
and
the
effort
to
recover
it
became
a
striving
a
struggle
in
which
harding
persisted
and
prevailed
yes
there
was
no
blinking
it
he
prevailed
she
had
been
prepared
for
it
but
not
as
for
a
thing
that
could
really
happen
it
was
contrary
to
all
that
she
knew
of
the
beneficent
working
of
the
power
she
thought
she
knew
all
its
ways
its
silences
its
reassurances
its
inexplicable
reservations
and
evasions
she
be
prepared
for
this
that
it
the
high
and
holy
the
unspeakably
pure
thing
should
allow
harding
to
prevail
should
connive
that
was
what
it
looked
like
at
his
taking
the
gift
into
his
own
hands
and
turning
it
to
his
own
advantage
against
rodney
lanyon
it
was
her
fear
at
last
that
made
her
write
to
rodney
she
wrote
in
the
beginning
of
the
fifth
week
she
was
counting
the
weeks
now
she
only
wanted
to
know
she
said
that
he
was
better
that
he
was
well
she
begged
him
to
write
and
tell
her
that
he
was
well
he
did
not
write
and
every
night
of
that
week
in
those
states
of
hers
powell
prevailed
he
was
becoming
almost
a
visible
presence
impressed
upon
the
blackness
of
the
state
all
she
could
do
then
was
to
evoke
the
visible
image
of
rodney
lanyon
and
place
it
there
over
harding
image
obliterating
him
now
properly
speaking
the
state
the
perfection
of
it
did
not
admit
of
visible
presences
and
that
harding
could
so
impress
himself
showed
more
than
anything
the
extent
to
which
he
had
prevailed
he
prevailed
to
such
good
purpose
that
he
was
now
milly
said
well
enough
to
go
back
to
business
they
were
to
leave
sarratt
end
in
about
ten
days
when
they
would
have
been
there
seven
weeks
she
had
come
over
on
the
sunday
to
let
agatha
know
that
and
also
she
said
to
make
a
confession
milly
face
as
she
said
it
was
all
candour
it
had
filled
out
it
had
bloomed
in
her
happiness
it
was
shadowless
featureless
almost
like
a
flower
she
had
done
what
she
said
she
would
do
she
had
told
harding
oh
milly
what
on
earth
did
you
do
that
for
agatha
voice
was
strange
i
thought
it
better
milly
said
revealing
the
fine
complacence
of
her
character
why
better
because
secrecy
is
bad
and
he
was
beginning
to
wonder
he
wanted
to
go
back
to
business
and
he
would
because
he
thought
it
was
the
place
that
did
it
i
see
said
agatha
and
what
does
he
think
it
is
now
he
thinks
it
dear
but
i
told
you
i
told
you
that
was
what
you
were
not
to
think
my
dear
it
an
immense
concession
that
he
should
think
it
you
a
concession
to
what
well
i
suppose
to
the
supernatural
milly
you
should
have
told
him
you
do
know
what
harm
you
might
have
done
i
not
sure
even
now
that
you
have
not
done
harm
oh
i
said
milly
triumphantly
you
only
got
to
look
at
him
when
did
you
tell
him
then
i
told
him
let
me
see
it
was
a
week
ago
last
friday
agatha
was
silent
she
wondered
it
had
been
after
friday
a
week
ago
that
he
had
prevailed
so
terribly
agatha
said
milly
solemnly
when
we
go
away
you
wo
lose
sight
of
him
you
wo
let
go
of
him
you
need
be
afraid
i
doubt
now
if
he
will
let
go
of
me
how
do
you
mean
milly
flushed
slightly
as
a
flower
might
flush
now
that
you
told
him
now
that
he
thinks
it
me
perhaps
said
milly
that
was
why
i
told
him
i
do
want
him
to
let
go
chapter
seven
it
was
the
sixth
week
and
still
rodney
did
not
write
and
agatha
was
more
and
more
afraid
by
this
time
she
had
definitely
connected
her
fear
with
harding
dominion
and
persistence
she
was
certain
now
that
what
she
could
only
call
his
importunity
had
proved
somehow
disastrous
to
rodney
lanyon
and
with
it
all
unacknowledged
beaten
back
her
desire
to
see
rodney
ran
to
and
fro
in
the
burrows
underground
he
did
not
write
but
on
the
friday
of
that
week
the
sixth
week
he
came
she
saw
him
coming
up
the
garden
path
and
she
shrank
back
into
her
room
but
the
light
searched
her
and
found
her
and
he
saw
her
there
he
never
knocked
he
came
straight
and
swiftly
to
her
through
the
open
doors
he
shut
the
door
of
the
room
behind
him
and
held
her
by
her
arms
with
both
his
hands
rodney
she
said
did
you
mean
to
come
or
did
i
make
you
i
meant
to
come
you
could
make
me
could
i
oh
i
could
you
could
he
said
but
you
did
and
what
does
it
matter
so
long
as
i
here
let
me
look
at
you
she
held
him
at
arm
length
and
turned
him
to
the
light
it
showed
his
face
white
worn
as
it
used
to
be
all
the
little
lines
of
worry
back
again
and
two
new
ones
that
drew
down
the
corners
of
his
mouth
you
been
ill
she
said
you
no
i
all
right
what
the
matter
with
with
me
nothing
do
i
look
as
if
anything
was
wrong
you
look
as
if
you
been
frightened
he
paused
considering
it
this
place
is
good
for
you
you
ought
to
be
here
like
this
all
by
yourself
oh
rodney
it
the
dearest
place
i
love
every
inch
of
it
besides
i
not
altogether
by
myself
he
did
not
seem
to
hear
her
and
what
he
said
next
arose
evidently
out
of
his
own
thoughts
i
say
are
those
powells
still
here
they
been
here
all
the
time
do
you
see
much
of
them
i
see
them
every
day
sometimes
nearly
all
day
that
accounts
for
it
again
he
paused
it
my
fault
agatha
i
should
have
left
you
to
them
i
knew
what
did
you
know
well
the
state
he
was
in
and
the
effect
it
would
have
on
you
that
it
would
have
on
any
one
it
all
right
he
going
besides
he
is
in
a
state
any
more
cured
cured
what
cured
him
she
evaded
him
he
been
well
ever
since
he
came
absolutely
well
after
the
first
day
still
you
been
frightened
you
been
worrying
you
had
some
shock
or
other
or
some
strain
what
is
it
nothing
only
just
the
last
week
i
been
a
little
frightened
about
you
when
you
would
write
to
me
why
did
you
because
i
could
then
you
i
all
right
i
know
what
the
matter
with
me
it
bella
he
laughed
harshly
no
it
is
this
time
i
have
that
excuse
excuse
for
what
for
coming
bella
all
right
bella
a
perfect
angel
god
knows
what
happened
to
her
i
do
have
had
anything
to
do
with
it
you
had
you
had
everything
you
were
an
angel
too
i
have
been
much
of
an
angel
lately
i
can
tell
you
she
understand
she
does
understand
they
had
sat
down
on
the
couch
in
the
corner
so
that
they
faced
each
other
agatha
faced
him
but
fear
was
in
her
eyes
it
does
matter
he
said
whether
she
understands
or
not
i
want
to
talk
about
her
agatha
said
nothing
but
there
was
a
movement
in
her
face
a
white
wave
of
trouble
and
the
fear
fluttered
in
her
eyes
he
saw
it
there
you
need
bother
about
bella
she
all
right
you
see
it
not
as
if
she
cared
cared
about
much
but
she
does
she
does
care
i
suppose
she
did
once
or
she
could
have
married
me
but
she
does
now
you
see
you
may
as
well
know
it
agatha
there
another
man
oh
rodney
no
yes
it
been
perfectly
all
right
you
know
but
there
he
is
and
there
he
been
for
years
she
told
me
i
awfully
sorry
for
her
he
paused
what
beats
me
is
her
being
so
angelic
now
when
she
does
care
rodney
she
does
it
all
over
like
an
illness
it
you
she
cares
for
think
so
i
sure
of
it
i
not
you
will
be
you
see
it
you
see
it
soon
he
glanced
at
her
under
his
bent
brows
i
do
know
he
said
that
i
want
to
see
it
is
what
the
matter
with
me
you
do
understand
the
situation
it
is
all
over
she
only
being
good
about
it
she
does
care
a
rap
about
me
she
and
what
more
i
do
want
her
to
you
do
want
her
to
he
burst
out
my
god
i
want
nothing
in
this
world
but
and
i
ca

you
that
what
the
matter
with
me
no
no
it
is
she
cried
you
do
know
i
do
know
it
hurting
me
and
he
looked
at
her
and
his
voice
shook
it
hurting
i
wo
have
you
hurt
he
started
forward
suddenly
as
if
he
would
have
taken
her
in
his
arms
she
put
up
her
hands
to
keep
him
off
no
no
she
cried
i
all
right
i
all
right
it
is
that
you
must
think
it
i
know
it
that
why
i
came
he
came
near
again
he
seized
her
struggling
hands
agatha
why
ca

should
we
no
no
she
moaned
we
ca

be
any
way

i
not

off
she
stood
up
her
face
changed
suddenly
rodney
i
forgot
they
coming
who
are
they
the
powells
they
coming
to
lunch
ca
you
put
them
off
i
can
but
it
would
be
very
wise
dear
they
might
think
confound
them
they
think
he
was
pulling
himself
visibly
together
i
afraid
aggy
i
ought
i
know
you
must
you
must
go
soon
he
looked
at
his
watch
i
must
go
dear
i
dare

it
dangerous
i
know
she
whispered
but
when
is
the
brute
going
poor
darling
he
going
next
week
next
thursday
well
then
i
i
please
you
must
go
i
going
she
held
out
her
hand
i
dare
touch
you
he
whispered
i
going
now
but
i
come
again
next
friday
and
i
stay
as
she
saw
his
drawn
face
there
was
not
any
strength
in
her
to
say
no
chapter
eight
he
had
gone
she
gathered
herself
together
and
went
across
the
field
to
meet
the
powells
as
if
nothing
had
happened
milly
and
her
husband
were
standing
at
the
gate
of
the
farm
they
were
watching
yes
they
were
watching
rodney
lanyon
as
he
crossed
the
river
by
the
farm
bridge
which
led
up
the
hill
by
the
field
path
that
slanted
to
the
farther
and
western
end
of
the
wood
their
attitude
showed
that
they
were
interested
in
his
brief
appearance
on
the
scene
and
that
they
wondered
what
he
had
been
doing
there
and
as
she
approached
them
she
was
aware
of
something
cold
ominous
and
inimical
that
came
from
them
and
set
towards
her
and
passed
by
her
sense
of
it
only
lasted
for
a
second
and
was
gone
so
completely
that
she
could
hardly
realise
that
she
had
ever
felt
it
for
they
were
charming
to
her
harding
indeed
was
more
perfect
in
his
beautiful
quality
than
ever
there
was
something
about
him
moreover
that
she
had
not
been
prepared
for
something
strange
and
pathetic
humble
almost
and
appealing
she
saw
it
in
his
eyes
his
large
dark
wild
animal
eyes
chiefly
but
it
was
a
look
that
claimed
as
much
as
it
deprecated
that
assumed
between
them
some
unspoken
communion
and
understanding
with
all
its
pathos
it
was
a
look
that
frightened
her
neither
he
nor
his
wife
said
a
word
about
rodney
lanyon
she
was
not
even
sure
now
that
they
had
recognised
him
they
stayed
with
her
all
that
afternoon
for
their
time
they
said
was
getting
short
and
when
about
six
milly
got
up
to
go
she
took
agatha
aside
and
said
that
if
agatha
did
mind
she
would
leave
harding
with
her
for
a
little
while
she
knew
he
wanted
to
talk
to
her
agatha
proposed
that
they
should
walk
up
the
hill
through
the
wood
they
went
in
a
curious
silence
and
constraint
and
it
was
not
until
they
had
got
into
the
wood
and
were
shut
up
in
it
together
that
he
spoke
i
think
my
wife
told
you
that
i
had
something
to
say
to
you
yes
harding
she
said
what
is
it
well
it
this
first
of
all
i
want
to
thank
you
i
know
what
doing
for
me
i
sorry
i
did
want
you
to
know
i
thought
milly
was
going
to
tell
you
she
did
tell
me
agatha
said
nothing
she
was
bound
to
accept
his
statement
of
course
he
must
have
known
that
milly
had
broken
her
word
and
he
was
trying
to
shield
her
i
mean
he
went
on
that
whether
she
told
me
or
not
it
no
matter
i
knew
you
knew
i
knew
that
something
was
happening
and
i
knew
that
it
was
the
place
places
never
make
any
difference
i
only
go
to
because
milly
thinks
they
do
besides
if
it
came
to
that
this
place
from
my
peculiar
point
of
view
mind
you
was
simply
beastly
i
could
have
stood
another
night
of
it
well
well
the
thing
went
and
i
got
all
right
and
the
queer
part
of
it
is
that
i
felt
as
if
you
were
in
it
somehow
as
if
you
done
something
i
half
hoped
you
might
say
something
but
you
never
did
one
ought
not
to
speak
about
these
things
harding
and
i
told
you
i
did
want
you
to
know
i
did
know
what
you
did
i
do
know
now
though
milly
tried
to
tell
me
but
i
felt
you
i
felt
you
all
the
time
it
was
not
i
you
felt
i
implore
you
not
to
think
it
was
what
can
i
think
think
as
i
do
think
think
she
stopped
herself
she
was
aware
of
the
futility
of
her
charge
to
this
man
who
denied
who
always
had
denied
the
supernatural
it
is
a
question
of
thinking
she
said
at
last
of
believing
then
are
you
going
to
tell
me
to
believe
no
it
is
believing
either
it
knowing
either
you
know
it
or
you
do
know
though
you
may
come
to
know
but
whatever
you
think
you
must
think
it
me
i
rather
like
to
why
should
i
she
turned
on
him
her
grave
white
face
and
he
noticed
a
curious
expression
there
as
of
incipient
terror
because
you
might
do
some
great
harm
either
to
yourself
or
his
delicate
sceptical
eyebrows
questioned
her
or
me
you
he
murmured
gently
pitifully
almost
yes
me
or
even
well
one
does
quite
know
where
the
harm
might
end
if
i
could
only
make
you
take
another
view
i
tried
to
make
you
to
work
it
that
way
so
that
you
might
find
the
secret
and
do
it
for
yourself
i
ca
do
anything
for
myself
but
agatha
i
take
any
view
you
like
of
it
so
long
as
you
keep
on
at
me
of
course
i
keep
on
at
that
he
stopped
suddenly
in
his
path
and
faced
her
i
say
you
know
it
is
hurting
you
is
it
she
felt
herself
wince
hurting
me
how
could
it
hurt
me
milly
said
it
could
agatha
sighed
she
said
to
herself
milly
if
only
milly
interfered
do
you
think
it
cold
here
in
the
wood
she
said
cold
yes
let
go
back
as
they
went
milly
met
them
at
the
farm
bridge
she
wanted
agatha
to
come
and
stay
for
supper
she
pressed
she
pleaded
and
agatha
who
had
never
yet
withstood
milly
pleading
stayed
it
was
from
that
evening
that
she
really
dated
it
the
thing
that
came
upon
her
she
was
aware
that
in
staying
she
disobeyed
an
instinct
that
told
her
to
go
home
otherwise
she
could
not
say
that
she
had
any
sort
of
premonition
supper
was
laid
in
the
long
room
with
the
yellow
blinds
where
she
had
first
found
harding
powell
the
blinds
were
down
and
the
lamp
on
the
table
burnt
low
the
oil
had
given
out
the
light
in
the
room
was
still
daylight
and
came
level
from
the
sunset
leaking
through
the
yellow
blinds
it
struck
agatha
that
it
was
the
same
light
the
same
ochreish
light
that
they
had
found
in
the
room
six
weeks
ago
but
that
was
nothing
what
it
was
she
did
not
know
the
horrible
light
went
when
the
flame
of
the
lamp
burnt
clearer
harding
was
talking
to
her
cheerfully
and
milly
was
smiling
at
them
both
when
half
through
the
meal
agatha
got
up
and
declared
that
she
must
go
she
was
ill
she
was
tired
they
must
forgive
her
but
she
must
go
the
powells
rose
and
stood
by
her
close
to
her
in
their
distress
milly
brought
wine
and
put
it
to
her
lips
but
she
turned
her
head
away
and
whispered
please
let
me
go
let
me
get
away
harding
wanted
to
walk
back
with
her
but
she
refused
with
a
vehemence
that
deterred
him
how
very
odd
of
her
said
milly
as
they
stood
at
the
gate
and
watched
her
go
she
was
walking
fast
almost
running
with
a
furtive
step
as
if
something
pursued
her
powell
did
not
speak
he
turned
from
his
wife
and
went
slowly
back
into
the
house
chapter
nine
she
knew
now
what
had
happened
to
her
she
afraid
of
harding
powell
and
it
was
her
fear
that
had
cried
to
her
to
go
to
get
away
from
him
the
awful
thing
was
that
she
knew
she
could
not
get
away
from
him
she
had
only
to
close
her
eyes
and
she
would
find
the
visible
image
of
him
hanging
before
her
on
the
wall
of
darkness
and
when
she
tried
to
cover
it
with
rodney
it
was
no
longer
obliterated
rodney
image
had
worn
thin
and
harding
showed
through
she
was
more
afraid
of
it
than
she
had
been
of
harding
and
more
than
anything
she
was
afraid
of
being
afraid
harding
was
the
object
of
a
boundless
and
indestructible
compassion
and
her
fear
of
him
was
hateful
to
her
and
unholy
she
knew
that
it
would
be
terrible
to
let
it
follow
her
into
that
darkness
where
she
would
presently
go
down
with
him
alone
it
would
be
all
right
she
said
to
herself
if
only
i
did
keep
on
seeing
him
but
he
his
visible
image
and
her
fear
of
it
persisted
even
while
the
interior
darkness
the
divine
beneficent
darkness
rose
round
her
wave
on
wave
and
flooded
her
even
while
she
held
him
there
and
healed
him
even
while
it
still
seemed
to
her
that
her
love
pierced
through
her
fear
and
gathered
to
her
spirit
to
spirit
flame
to
pure
flame
the
nameless
innermost
essence
of
rodney
and
of
bella
she
had
known
in
the
beginning
that
it
was
by
love
that
she
held
them
but
now
though
she
loved
rodney
and
had
almost
lost
her
pity
for
harding
in
her
fear
of
him
it
was
harding
rather
than
rodney
that
she
held
in
the
morning
she
woke
with
a
sense
which
was
almost
a
memory
of
harding
having
been
in
the
room
with
her
all
night
she
was
tired
as
if
she
had
had
some
long
and
unrestrained
communion
with
him
she
put
away
at
once
the
fatigue
that
pressed
on
her
the
gift
still
worked
in
a
flash
for
the
effacing
of
bodily
sensation
she
told
herself
that
after
all
her
fear
had
done
no
harm
seldom
in
her
experience
of
the
power
had
she
had
so
tremendous
a
sense
of
having
got
through
to
it
of
having
worked
it
of
having
held
harding
under
it
and
healed
him
for
when
all
was
said
and
done
whether
she
had
been
afraid
of
him
or
not
she
had
held
him
she
had
never
once
let
go
the
proof
was
that
he
still
went
sane
visibly
indubitably
cured
all
the
same
she
felt
that
she
could
not
go
through
another
day
like
yesterday
she
could
not
see
him
she
wrote
a
letter
to
milly
since
it
concerned
milly
so
profoundly
it
was
well
that
milly
should
be
made
to
understand
she
hoped
that
milly
would
forgive
her
if
they
did
see
her
for
the
next
day
or
two
if
she
was
to
go
on
she
underlined
it
she
must
be
left
absolutely
alone
it
seemed
unkind
when
they
were
going
so
soon
but
milly
knew
it
was
impossible
to
exaggerate
the
importance
of
what
she
had
to
do
milly
wrote
back
that
of
course
she
understood
it
should
be
as
agatha
wished
only
so
milly
sustained
her
agatha
must
not
allow
herself
to
doubt
the
power
how
could
she
when
she
saw
what
it
had
done
for
harding
if
doubted
what
could
she
expect
of
harding
but
of
course
she
must
take
care
of
her
own
dear
self
if
she
failed
if
she
gave
way
what
on
earth
would
the
poor
darling
do
now
that
he
had
become
dependent
on
her
she
wrote
as
if
it
was
agatha
fault
that
he
had
become
dependent
as
if
agatha
had
nothing
had
nobody
in
the
world
to
think
of
but
harding
as
if
nobody
as
if
nothing
in
the
world
beside
harding
mattered
and
agatha
found
herself
resenting
milly
view
as
if
to
her
anything
in
the
world
mattered
beside
rodney
lanyon
for
three
days
she
did
not
see
the
powells
chapter
ten
the
three
nights
passed
as
before
but
with
an
increasing
struggle
and
fear
she
knew
she
knew
what
was
happening
it
was
as
if
the
walls
of
personality
were
wearing
thin
and
through
them
she
felt
him
trying
to
get
at
her
she
put
the
thought
from
her
it
was
absurd
it
was
insane
such
things
could
not
be
it
was
not
in
any
region
of
such
happenings
that
she
held
him
but
in
the
place
of
peace
the
charmed
circle
the
flawless
crystal
sphere
still
the
thought
persisted
and
still
in
spite
of
it
she
held
him
she
would
not
let
him
go
by
her
honour
and
by
her
love
for
milly
she
was
bound
to
hold
him
even
though
she
knew
how
terribly
how
implacably
he
prevailed
she
was
aware
now
that
the
persistence
of
his
image
on
the
blackness
was
only
a
sign
to
her
of
his
being
there
in
his
substance
in
his
supreme
innermost
essence
it
had
obviously
no
relation
to
his
bodily
appearance
since
she
had
not
seen
him
for
three
days
it
tended
more
and
more
to
vanish
to
give
place
to
the
shapeless
nameless
presence
and
her
fear
of
him
became
pervading
nameless
and
shapeless
too
somehow
it
was
always
behind
her
now
it
followed
her
from
room
to
room
of
her
house
it
drove
her
out
of
doors
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
went
before
it
with
quick
uncertain
feet
and
a
fluttering
heart
aimless
and
tormented
as
a
leaf
driven
by
a
vague
light
wind
sometimes
it
sent
her
up
the
field
towards
the
wood
sometimes
it
would
compel
her
to
go
a
little
way
towards
the
farm
and
then
it
was
as
if
it
took
her
by
the
shoulders
and
turned
her
back
again
towards
her
house
on
the
fourth
day
which
was
tuesday
of
the
powells
last
week
she
determined
to
fight
this
fear
she
could
not
defy
it
to
the
extent
of
going
on
to
the
farm
where
she
might
see
harding
but
certainly
she
would
not
suffer
it
to
turn
her
from
her
it
was
there
that
she
had
always
gone
as
the
night
fell
calling
home
her
thoughts
to
sleep
and
it
was
there
seven
weeks
ago
that
the
moon
the
and
holy
moon
had
led
her
to
the
consecration
of
her
gift
she
had
returned
softly
seven
weeks
ago
carrying
carefully
her
gift
as
a
fragile
flawless
crystal
since
then
how
recklessly
she
had
held
it
to
what
jars
and
risks
she
had
exposed
the
exquisite
and
sacred
thing
she
waited
for
her
hour
between
sunset
and
twilight
it
was
perfect
following
a
perfect
day
above
the
wood
the
sky
had
a
violet
lucidity
purer
than
the
day
below
it
the
pale
brown
earth
wore
a
violet
haze
and
over
that
a
web
of
green
woven
of
the
sparse
thin
blades
of
the
young
wheat
there
were
two
ways
up
the
hill
one
over
her
own
bridge
across
the
river
that
led
her
to
the
steep
straight
path
through
the
wood
one
over
the
farm
bridge
by
the
slanting
path
up
the
field
she
chose
the
wood
she
paused
on
the
bridge
and
looked
down
the
valley
she
saw
the
standing
in
the
stillness
that
was
its
own
secret
and
the
hour
a
strange
pale
lamplight
lit
too
soon
showed
in
the
windows
of
the
room
she
knew
the
powells
would
be
sitting
there
at
their
supper
she
went
on
and
came
to
the
gate
of
the
wood
it
swung
open
on
its
hinges
a
sign
to
her
that
some
time
or
other
harding
powell
had
passed
there
she
paused
and
looked
about
her
presently
she
saw
harding
powell
coming
down
the
he
stopped
he
had
not
yet
seen
her
he
was
looking
up
to
the
arch
of
the
where
the
green
light
still
came
through
she
could
see
by
his
attitude
of
quiet
contemplation
the
sane
and
happy
creature
that
he
was
he
was
sane
she
knew
and
yet
no
she
could
not
really
see
him
as
sane
it
was
her
sanity
not
his
own
that
he
walked
in
or
else
what
she
saw
was
the
empty
shell
of
him
was
in
her
hitherto
it
had
been
in
the
darkness
that
she
had
felt
him
most
and
her
fear
of
him
had
been
chiefly
fear
of
the
invisible
harding
and
of
what
he
might
do
there
in
the
darkness
now
her
fear
which
had
become
almost
hatred
was
transferred
to
his
person
in
the
flesh
as
in
the
spirit
he
was
pursuing
her
he
had
seen
her
now
he
was
making
straight
for
her
and
she
turned
and
ran
round
the
eastern
bend
of
the
hill
a
yard
or
so
to
the
left
of
her
and
hid
from
him
from
where
she
crouched
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
she
saw
him
descend
the
lower
slope
to
the
river
by
standing
up
and
advancing
a
little
she
could
see
him
follow
the
river
path
on
the
nearer
side
and
cross
by
the
farm
bridge
she
was
sure
of
all
that
she
was
sure
that
it
did
not
take
her
more
than
twelve
or
fifteen
minutes
for
she
had
gone
that
way
a
hundred
times
to
get
back
to
the
gate
to
walk
up
the
little
wood
to
cut
through
it
by
a
track
in
the
undergrowth
and
turn
round
the
further
and
western
end
of
it
thence
she
could
either
take
the
long
path
that
slanted
across
the
field
to
the
farm
bridge
or
keep
to
the
upper
ground
along
a
trail
in
the
grass
skirting
the
wood
and
so
reach
home
by
the
short
straight
path
and
her
own
bridge
she
decided
on
the
short
straight
path
as
leading
her
farther
from
the
where
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
harding
powell
was
now
at
the
point
she
had
reached
the
jutting
corner
of
the
wood
hid
from
her
the
downward
slope
of
the
hill
and
the
flat
land
at
its
foot
as
she
turned
the
corner
of
the
wood
she
was
brought
suddenly
in
sight
of
the
valley
a
hot
wave
swept
over
her
brain
so
strong
that
she
staggered
as
it
passed
it
was
followed
by
a
strange
sensation
of
physical
sickness
that
passed
also
it
was
then
as
if
what
went
through
her
had
charged
her
nerves
of
sight
to
a
pitch
of
insane
and
horrible
sensibility
the
green
of
the
grass
and
of
the
young
corn
the
very
colour
of
life
was
violent
and
frightful
not
only
was
it
abominable
in
itself
it
was
a
thing
to
be
shuddered
at
because
of
some
still
more
abominable
significance
it
had
agatha
had
known
once
standing
where
she
stood
now
an
exaltation
of
sense
that
was
ecstasy
when
every
leaf
and
every
blade
of
grass
shone
with
a
divine
translucence
when
every
nerve
in
her
thrilled
and
her
whole
being
rang
with
the
joy
which
is
immanent
in
the
life
of
things
what
she
experienced
now
if
she
could
have
given
any
account
of
it
was
exaltation
at
the
other
end
of
the
scale
it
was
horror
and
fear
unspeakable
horror
and
fear
immanent
in
the
life
of
things
she
saw
the
world
in
a
loathsome
transparency
she
saw
it
with
the
eye
of
a
soul
in
which
no
sense
of
the
divine
had
ever
been
of
a
soul
that
denied
the
supernatural
it
had
been
harding
powell
soul
and
it
had
become
hers
furiously
implacably
he
was
getting
at
her
out
of
the
wood
and
the
hedges
that
bordered
it
there
came
sounds
that
were
horrible
because
she
knew
them
to
be
inaudible
to
any
ear
less
charged
with
insanity
small
sounds
of
movement
of
strange
shiverings
swarmings
crepitations
sounds
of
incessant
infinitely
subtle
urging
of
agony
and
recoil
sounds
they
were
of
the
invisible
things
unborn
driven
towards
birth
sounds
of
the
worm
unborn
of
things
that
creep
and
writhe
towards
dissolution
she
knew
what
she
heard
and
saw
she
heard
the
stirring
of
the
corruption
that
life
was
the
young
blades
of
corn
were
frightful
to
her
for
in
them
was
the
push
the
passion
of
the
evil
which
was
life
the
trees
as
they
stretched
out
their
arms
and
threatened
her
were
frightful
with
the
terror
which
was
life
down
there
in
that
gross
green
the
earth
teemed
with
the
abomination
and
the
river
livid
white
a
monstrous
thing
crawled
dragging
with
it
the
very
slime
all
this
she
perceived
in
a
flash
when
she
had
turned
the
corner
it
sank
into
stillness
and
grew
dim
she
was
aware
of
it
only
as
the
scene
the
region
in
which
one
thing
her
terror
moved
and
hunted
her
among
sounds
of
the
rustling
of
leaves
and
the
soft
crush
of
grass
and
the
whirring
of
little
wings
in
fright
she
heard
it
go
it
went
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
a
little
way
behind
her
as
she
skirted
the
wood
she
stood
still
to
let
it
pass
her
and
she
felt
that
it
passed
and
that
it
stopped
and
waited
a
terrified
bird
flew
out
of
the
hedge
no
further
than
a
fledgling
flight
in
front
of
her
and
in
that
place
it
flew
from
she
saw
harding
powell
he
was
crouching
under
the
hedge
as
she
had
crouched
when
she
had
hidden
from
him
his
face
was
horrible
but
not
more
horrible
than
the
terror
that
had
gone
behind
her
and
she
heard
herself
crying
out
to
him
harding
harding
appealing
to
him
against
the
implacable
unseen
pursuer
he
had
risen
she
saw
him
rise
but
as
she
called
his
name
he
became
insubstantial
and
she
saw
a
thing
a
nameless
unnameable
shapeless
thing
proceeding
from
him
a
brown
blurred
thing
transparent
as
dusk
is
that
drifted
on
the
air
it
was
torn
and
tormented
a
fragment
parted
and
flung
off
from
some
immense
and
as
yet
invisible
cloud
of
horror
it
drifted
from
her
it
dissolved
like
smoke
on
the
hillside
and
the
thing
that
had
born
and
begotten
it
pursued
her
she
bowed
under
it
and
turned
from
the
edge
of
the
wood
the
horrible
place
it
had
been
born
in
she
ran
before
it
headlong
down
the
field
trampling
the
young
corn
under
her
feet
as
she
ran
she
heard
a
voice
in
the
valley
a
voice
of
amazement
and
entreaty
calling
to
her
in
a
sort
of
song
what
are
you
running
for
aggy
aggy
it
was
milly
voice
that
called
then
as
she
came
still
headlong
to
the
river
she
heard
voice
saying
something
she
did
not
know
what
she
could
stop
to
listen
to
him
or
to
consider
how
he
came
to
be
there
in
the
valley
when
a
minute
ago
she
had
seen
him
by
the
edge
of
the
wood
up
on
the
very
top
of
the
hill
he
was
on
the
bridge
the
farm
bridge
now
he
held
out
his
hand
to
steady
her
as
she
came
on
over
the
swinging
plank
she
knew
that
he
had
led
her
to
the
other
side
and
that
he
was
standing
there
still
saying
something
and
that
she
answered
have
you
pity
on
me
ca
you
let
me
go
and
then
she
broke
from
him
and
ran
chapter
eleven
she
was
awake
all
that
night
harding
powell
and
the
horror
begotten
of
him
had
no
pity
he
would
not
let
her
go
her
gift
her
secret
was
powerless
now
against
the
pursuer
she
had
a
light
burning
in
her
room
till
morning
for
she
was
afraid
of
sleep
those
unlit
roads
down
which
if
she
slept
the
thing
would
surely
hunt
her
were
ten
times
more
terrible
than
the
familiar
room
where
it
merely
watched
and
waited
in
the
morning
she
found
a
letter
on
her
which
the
maid
said
powell
had
left
late
last
evening
after
agatha
had
gone
to
bed
milly
wrote
dearest
agatha
of
course
i
understand
but
are
we
going
to
see
you
again
what
was
the
matter
with
you
last
night
you
terrified
poor
yours
ever
without
knowing
why
agatha
tore
the
letter
into
bits
and
burned
them
in
the
flame
of
a
candle
she
watched
them
burn
of
course
she
said
to
herself
that
is
sane
of
me
and
when
she
had
gone
round
her
house
and
shut
all
the
doors
and
locked
them
and
drawn
down
the
blinds
in
every
closed
window
and
found
herself
cowering
over
her
fireless
hearth
shuddering
with
fear
she
knew
that
whether
she
were
mad
or
not
there
was
madness
in
her
she
knew
that
her
face
in
the
glass
she
had
the
courage
to
look
at
it
was
the
face
of
an
insane
terror
let
loose
that
she
did
know
it
that
there
were
moments
flashes
in
which
she
could
contemplate
her
state
and
recognise
it
for
what
it
was
showed
that
there
was
still
a
trace
of
sanity
in
her
it
was
not
her
own
madness
that
possessed
her
it
was
or
rather
it
had
been
harding
powell
she
had
taken
it
from
him
that
was
what
it
meant
to
take
away
madness
there
could
be
no
doubt
as
to
what
had
happened
nor
as
to
the
way
of
its
happening
the
danger
of
it
utterly
unforeseen
was
part
of
the
very
operation
of
the
gift
in
the
process
of
getting
at
harding
to
heal
him
she
had
had
to
destroy
not
only
the
barriers
of
flesh
and
blood
but
those
innermost
walls
of
personality
that
divide
and
protect
mercifully
one
spirit
from
another
with
the
first
thinning
of
the
walls
harding
insanity
had
leaked
through
to
her
with
the
first
breach
it
had
broken
in
it
had
been
transferred
to
her
complete
with
all
its
details
with
its
very
gestures
in
all
the
phases
that
it
ran
through
harding
premonitory
fears
and
tremblings
harding
exalted
sensibility
harding
abominable
vision
of
the
world
that
vision
from
which
the
resplendent
divinity
had
perished
harding
flight
before
the
pursuing
terror
she
was
sitting
now
as
harding
had
sat
when
she
found
him
crouching
over
the
hearth
in
that
horrible
room
with
the
drawn
blinds
it
seemed
to
her
that
to
have
a
madness
of
your
own
would
not
be
so
very
horrible
it
would
be
after
all
your
own
it
could
not
possibly
be
so
horrible
as
this
to
have
somebody
madness
put
into
you
the
one
thing
by
which
she
knew
herself
was
the
desire
that
no
longer
ran
underground
but
emerged
and
appeared
before
her
lit
by
her
lucid
flashes
naked
and
unashamed
she
still
knew
her
own
and
there
was
something
in
her
still
that
was
greater
than
the
thing
that
inhabited
her
the
pursuer
the
pursued
who
had
rushed
into
her
as
his
refuge
his
sanctuary
and
that
was
her
fear
of
him
and
of
what
he
might
do
there
if
her
doors
stood
open
to
him
they
stood
open
to
bella
and
to
rodney
lanyon
too
what
else
had
she
been
trying
for
if
it
were
not
to
break
down
in
all
three
of
them
the
barriers
of
flesh
and
blood
and
to
transmit
the
power
in
the
unthinkable
sacrament
to
which
she
called
them
they
had
all
three
partaken
and
since
the
holy
thing
could
suffer
her
to
be
thus
permeated
saturated
with
harding
powell
was
it
to
be
supposed
that
she
could
keep
him
to
herself
that
she
would
not
pass
him
on
to
rodney
lanyon
it
was
not
after
all
incredible
if
he
could
get
at
her
of
course
he
could
get
through
her
at
rodney
that
was
the
terror
of
terrors
and
it
was
her
own
that
it
could
subsist
together
with
that
alien
horror
that
it
remained
supreme
beside
it
proved
that
there
was
still
some
tract
in
her
where
the
invader
had
not
yet
penetrated
in
her
love
for
rodney
and
her
fear
for
him
she
entrenched
herself
against
the
destroyer
there
at
least
she
knew
herself
impregnable
it
was
in
such
a
luminous
flash
that
she
saw
the
thing
still
in
her
own
hands
and
resolved
that
it
should
cease
she
would
have
to
break
her
word
to
milly
she
would
have
to
let
harding
go
to
loosen
deliberately
his
hold
on
her
and
cut
him
off
it
could
be
done
she
had
held
him
through
her
gift
and
it
would
be
still
possible
through
the
gift
to
let
him
go
of
course
she
knew
it
would
be
hard
it
hard
it
was
terrible
for
he
clung
she
had
not
counted
on
his
clinging
it
was
as
if
in
their
undivided
substance
he
had
had
knowledge
of
her
purpose
and
had
prepared
himself
to
fight
it
he
hung
on
desperately
he
refused
to
yield
an
inch
of
the
ground
he
had
taken
from
her
he
was
no
longer
a
passive
thing
in
that
world
where
she
had
brought
him
and
he
had
certain
advantages
he
had
possessed
her
for
three
nights
and
for
three
days
she
had
made
herself
porous
to
him
and
her
sleep
had
always
been
his
opportunity
it
took
her
three
nights
and
three
days
to
cast
him
out
in
the
first
night
she
struggled
with
him
she
lay
with
all
her
senses
hushed
and
brought
the
divine
darkness
round
her
but
in
the
darkness
she
was
aware
that
she
struggled
she
could
build
up
the
walls
between
them
but
she
knew
that
as
fast
as
she
built
them
he
tore
at
them
and
pulled
them
down
she
bore
herself
humbly
towards
the
power
that
permitted
him
she
conceived
of
it
as
holiness
estranged
and
offended
she
pleaded
with
it
she
could
no
longer
trust
her
knowledge
of
its
working
but
she
tried
to
come
to
terms
with
it
she
offered
herself
as
a
propitiation
as
a
substitute
for
rodney
lanyon
if
there
was
no
other
way
by
which
he
might
be
saved
apparently
that
was
not
the
way
it
worked
harding
seemed
to
gain
but
as
he
kept
her
awake
all
night
he
had
no
chance
to
establish
himself
as
he
would
otherwise
have
done
in
her
sleep
the
odds
between
her
and
her
adversary
were
even
the
second
night
gained
she
felt
that
she
had
built
up
her
walls
again
that
she
had
cut
harding
off
with
spiritual
pain
with
the
tearing
of
the
bonds
of
compassion
with
a
supreme
agony
of
rupture
he
parted
from
her
possibly
the
power
was
neutral
for
in
the
dawn
after
the
second
night
she
slept
that
sleep
left
her
uncertain
of
the
event
there
was
no
telling
into
what
unguarded
depths
it
might
have
carried
her
she
knew
that
she
had
been
free
of
her
adversary
before
she
slept
but
the
chances
were
that
he
had
got
at
her
in
her
sleep
since
the
power
held
the
balance
even
between
her
and
the
invader
it
would
no
doubt
permit
him
to
enter
by
any
loophole
that
he
could
seize
on
the
third
night
as
it
were
in
the
last
watch
she
surrendered
but
not
to
harding
powell
she
could
not
say
how
it
came
to
her
she
was
lying
in
her
bed
with
her
eyes
shut
and
her
arms
held
apart
from
her
body
diminishing
all
contacts
stripping
for
her
long
slide
into
the
cleansing
darkness
when
she
found
herself
recalling
some
forgotten
yet
inalienable
knowledge
that
she
had
something
said
to
her
do
you
not
remember
there
is
no
striving
and
no
crying
in
the
world
which
you
would
enter
there
is
no
more
appeasing
where
peace
you
can
not
make
your
own
terms
with
the
high
and
holy
power
it
is
not
enough
to
give
yourself
for
rodney
lanyon
for
he
is
more
to
you
than
you
are
yourself
besides
any
substitution
of
self
for
self
would
be
useless
for
there
is
no
more
self
there
that
is
why
the
power
can
not
work
that
way
but
if
it
should
require
you
here
on
this
side
the
threshold
to
give
him
up
to
give
up
your
desire
of
him
what
then
would
you
loose
your
hold
on
him
and
let
him
go
would
you
the
voice
insisted
she
heard
herself
answer
from
the
pure
threshold
of
the
darkness
i
would
sleep
came
on
her
there
a
divine
sleep
from
beyond
the
threshold
sacred
inviolate
sleep
it
was
the
seal
upon
the
bond
chapter
twelve
she
woke
on
friday
morning
to
a
vivid
and
indestructible
certainty
of
escape
but
there
had
been
a
condition
attached
to
her
deliverance
and
it
was
borne
in
on
her
that
instead
of
waiting
for
the
power
to
force
its
terms
on
her
she
would
do
well
to
be
beforehand
with
it
friday
was
day
and
this
time
she
knew
that
he
would
come
his
coming
of
course
was
nothing
but
he
had
told
her
plainly
that
he
would
not
go
she
must
therefore
wire
to
him
not
to
come
in
order
to
do
this
she
had
to
get
up
early
and
walk
about
a
mile
to
the
nearest
village
she
took
the
shortest
way
which
was
by
the
farm
bridge
and
up
the
slanting
path
to
the
far
end
of
the
wood
she
knew
vaguely
that
once
as
she
had
turned
the
corner
of
the
wood
there
had
been
horrors
and
that
the
divine
beauty
of
green
pastures
and
still
waters
had
appeared
to
her
as
a
valley
of
the
shadow
of
evil
but
she
had
no
more
memory
of
what
she
had
seen
than
of
a
foul
dream
three
nights
dead
she
went
at
first
uplifted
in
the
joy
of
her
deliverance
drawing
into
her
the
light
and
fragrance
of
the
young
morning
then
she
remembered
harding
powell
she
had
noticed
as
she
passed
the
farm
house
that
the
blinds
were
drawn
again
in
all
the
windows
that
was
because
harding
and
milly
were
gone
she
thought
of
harding
of
milly
with
an
immense
tenderness
and
compassion
but
also
with
lucidity
with
sanity
they
had
gone
yesterday
and
she
had
not
seen
them
that
could
not
be
helped
she
had
done
all
that
was
possible
she
could
not
have
seen
them
as
long
as
the
least
taint
of
harding
malady
remained
with
her
and
how
could
she
have
faced
milly
after
having
broken
her
word
to
her
not
that
she
regretted
even
that
the
breaking
of
her
word
so
sane
was
she
she
could
conceive
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
rodney
lanyon
she
might
have
had
the
courage
to
have
gone
on
she
might
have
considered
that
she
was
bound
to
save
harding
even
at
the
price
of
her
own
sanity
since
there
her
word
to
milly
but
it
might
be
questioned
whether
by
holding
on
to
him
she
would
have
kept
it
whether
she
really
could
have
saved
him
that
way
she
was
no
more
than
a
vehicle
a
crystal
vessel
for
the
inscrutable
and
secret
power
and
in
destroying
her
utterly
harding
would
have
destroyed
himself
you
could
not
transmit
the
power
through
a
broken
crystal
why
not
even
through
one
that
had
a
flaw
there
had
been
a
flaw
somewhere
so
much
was
certain
and
as
she
searched
now
for
the
flaw
with
her
luminous
sanity
she
found
it
in
her
fear
she
knew
she
had
always
known
the
danger
of
taking
fear
and
the
thought
of
fear
with
her
into
that
world
where
to
think
was
to
will
and
to
will
was
to
create
but
for
the
rest
she
had
tried
to
make
herself
clear
as
crystal
and
what
could
she
do
more
than
give
up
rodney
as
she
set
her
face
towards
the
village
she
was
sustained
by
a
sacred
ardour
a
sacrificial
exaltation
but
as
she
turned
homewards
across
the
solitary
fields
she
realised
the
sadness
the
desolation
of
the
thing
she
had
accomplished
he
would
not
come
her
message
would
reach
him
two
hours
before
the
starting
of
the
train
he
always
came
by
across
the
village
she
saw
her
white
house
shining
and
the
windows
of
his
room
her
study
which
was
always
his
room
when
he
came
its
lattices
were
flung
open
as
if
it
welcomed
him
something
had
happened
there
her
maid
was
standing
by
the
garden
gate
looking
for
her
as
she
approached
the
girl
came
over
the
field
to
meet
her
she
had
an
air
of
warning
her
of
preparing
her
for
something
it
was
powell
the
maid
said
she
had
come
again
she
was
in
there
waiting
for
miss
agatha
she
would
go
away
she
had
gone
straight
in
she
was
in
an
awful
state
the
maid
thought
it
was
something
to
do
with
powell
they
had
not
gone
then
if
i
were
you
miss
the
maid
was
saying
i
would
see
her
of
course
i
shall
see
her
she
went
at
once
into
the
room
where
rodney
might
have
been
where
milly
was
milly
rose
from
the
corner
where
she
sat
averted
agatha
she
said
i
had
to
come
agatha
kissed
the
white
suppliant
face
that
milly
lifted
i
thought
she
said
you
gone
yesterday
we
could
go
he
he
ill
again
ill
yes
did
you
see
the
blinds
down
as
you
passed
i
thought
it
was
because
you
gone
it
because
that
come
back
again
when
did
it
come
milly
it
been
coming
for
three
days
agatha
drew
in
her
breath
with
a
pang
it
was
just
three
days
since
she
began
to
let
him
go
milly
went
on
and
now
he
wo
come
out
of
the
house
he
says
being
hunted
he
afraid
of
being
seen
being
found
he
in
there
in
that
room
he
made
me
lock
him
in
they
stared
at
each
other
and
at
the
horror
that
their
faces
took
and
gave
back
each
to
each
oh
aggy
milly
cried
it
out
in
her
anguish
you
help
him
i
ca
agatha
heard
her
voice
go
dry
in
her
throat
you
agatha
shook
her
head
you
mean
you
have
then
i
have
i
could
but
you
told
me
you
told
me
you
were
giving
yourself
up
to
it
you
said
that
was
why
you
could
see
us
it
why
do
sit
down
milly
they
sat
down
still
staring
at
each
other
agatha
faced
the
window
so
that
the
light
ravaged
her
milly
went
on
that
was
why
i
left
you
alone
i
thought
you
were
going
on
you
said
you
would
let
him
go
you
promised
me
you
keep
on
i
did
keep
on
till
but
milly
had
only
paused
to
hold
down
a
sob
her
voice
broke
out
again
clear
harsh
accusing
what
were
you
doing
all
that
time
of
course
said
agatha
you
bound
to
think
i
let
you
down
what
am
i
to
think
milly
i
asked
you
not
to
think
it
was
me
of
course
i
knew
it
was
the
power
not
you
but
you
had
hold
of
it
you
did
something
something
that
other
people
ca
do
you
did
it
for
one
night
and
that
night
he
was
well
you
kept
on
for
six
weeks
and
he
was
well
all
that
time
you
leave
off
for
three
days
i
know
when
you
left
off
and
he
ill
again
and
then
you
tell
me
that
it
is
you
it
you
and
if
it
you
you
ca
give
him
up
you
ca
stand
by
aggy
and
refuse
to
help
him
you
know
what
it
was
how
can
you
bear
to
let
him
suffer
how
can
you
i
can
because
i
must
and
why
must
you
milly
raised
her
head
more
in
defiance
than
in
supplication
because
i
told
you
that
i
might
give
out
well
i
have
given
out
you
told
me
that
the
power
ca
give
out
that
you
only
got
to
hold
on
to
it
that
it
no
effort
i
only
asking
you
aggy
to
hold
on
you
do
know
what
you
asking
i
asking
you
only
to
do
what
you
have
done
to
give
five
minutes
in
the
day
to
him
you
said
it
was
enough
only
five
minutes
it
is
much
to
ask
agatha
sighed
what
difference
could
it
make
to
you
five
minutes
you
do
understand
said
agatha
i
do
i
do
ask
you
to
see
him
or
to
bother
with
him
only
to
go
on
as
you
were
doing
you
do
understand
it
is
possible
to
explain
it
i
ca
go
on
i
see
you
tired
aggy
well
not
now
not
but
later
when
you
rested
wo
you
oh
milly
dear
milly
if
i
could
you
can
you
will
i
know
you
will
no
you
must
understand
it
never
again
never
again
never
never
there
was
a
long
silence
at
last
milly
voice
crept
through
strained
and
thin
feebly
argumentative
the
voice
of
a
thing
defeated
and
yet
unconvinced
i
do
understand
you
agatha
you
say
it
is
you
you
say
only
a
connecting
link
that
you
do
nothing
that
the
power
that
does
it
is
inexhaustible
that
there
nothing
it
ca
do
nothing
that
it
wo
do
for
us
and
yet
you
go
and
cut
yourself
off
from
it
deliberately
from
the
thing
you
believe
to
be
divine
i
have
cut
myself
off
from
it
you
cut
harding
off
said
milly
if
you
refuse
to
hold
him
that
would
cut
him
off
from
it
but
milly
holding
him
was
bad
it
was
safe
it
saved
him
all
the
same
milly
it
was
safe
the
thing
itself
is
the
power
the
divine
thing
yes
it
divine
and
it
it
terrible
it
does
terrible
things
to
us
how
could
it
if
it
divine
would
it
be
compassionate
do
you
suppose
it
less
compassionate
than
are
why
agatha
when
goodness
and
purity
itself
goodness
and
purity
are
terrible
we
do
understand
it
it
got
its
own
laws
what
you
call
prayer
all
right
it
would
be
safe
i
mean
i
suppose
it
might
get
answered
anyway
however
we
fell
short
but
this
this
is
different
it
the
highest
milly
and
if
you
rush
in
and
make
for
the
highest
ca
you
see
oh
ca
you
see
how
it
might
break
you
ca
you
see
what
it
requires
of
absolute
purity
i
told
you
milly
you
have
to
be
crystal
to
it
crystal
without
a
flaw
and
if
there
were
a
flaw
the
whole
thing
do
you
see
would
break
down
it
would
be
no
good
in
fact
it
would
be
awfully
dangerous
to
whom
to
you
to
them
the
people
you
helping
you
make
a
connection
you
smash
down
all
the
walls
so
that
you
you
get
through
to
each
other
and
supposing
there
was
something
wrong
with
and
it
does
work
any
longer
the
power
i
mean
do
you
see
that
you
might
do
harm
where
you
were
trying
to
help
but
agatha
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
you
how
do
i
know
can
anybody
be
sure
there
nothing
wrong
with
them
you
think
said
milly
there
was
a
flaw
somewhere
there
must
have
been
somewhere
what
was
it
ca
you
find
out
ca
you
think
think
sometimes
i
have
thought
it
may
have
been
my
fear
fear
yes
it
the
worst
thing
do
you
remember
i
told
you
not
to
be
afraid
but
agatha
you
were
afraid
i
was
afterwards
i
got
frightened
and
you
told
not
to
be
afraid
said
milly
i
had
to
tell
you
and
i
was
afraid
afterwards
i
believed
in
you
he
believed
in
you
you
should
have
you
should
that
was
just
it
that
was
it
i
suppose
you
say
next
it
was
i
who
frightened
you
as
they
faced
each
other
there
agatha
with
the
terrible
the
almost
supernatural
lucidity
she
had
saw
what
was
making
milly
say
that
milly
had
been
frightened
she
felt
that
she
had
probably
communicated
her
fright
she
knew
that
that
was
dangerous
and
she
knew
that
if
it
had
done
harm
to
harding
she
and
not
agatha
would
be
responsible
and
because
she
could
face
her
responsibility
she
was
trying
to
fasten
upon
agatha
some
other
fault
than
fear
no
milly
i
do
say
you
frightened
me
it
was
my
own
fear
what
was
there
for
to
be
afraid
of
agatha
was
silent
that
was
what
she
must
never
tell
her
not
even
to
make
her
understand
she
did
not
know
what
milly
was
trying
to
think
of
her
milly
might
think
what
she
liked
but
she
should
never
know
what
her
terror
had
been
and
her
danger
agatha
silence
helped
milly
nothing
will
make
me
believe
she
said
that
it
was
your
fear
that
did
it
that
would
never
have
made
you
give
harding
up
besides
you
were
not
afraid
at
first
though
you
may
have
been
afterwards
afterwards
it
was
her
own
word
but
it
had
as
yet
no
significance
for
her
after
whatever
it
was
you
gave
him
up
for
you
gave
him
up
for
something
i
did
not
i
never
gave
him
up
until
i
was
afraid
you
gave
it
up
you
would
have
done
that
if
there
had
not
been
something
something
that
stood
between
if
said
agatha
you
could
only
tell
me
what
it
was
i
ca
tell
you
i
do
know
what
came
to
you
i
only
know
that
if
i
had
a
gift
like
that
i
would
not
have
given
it
up
for
anything
i
would
have
let
anything
come
between
i
have
kept
myself
i
did
keep
myself
for
i
could
keep
myself
entirely
for
harding
there
were
other
things
other
people
i
could
give
them
up
for
harding
or
for
anybody
are
you
quite
sure
you
kept
yourself
what
you
were
aggy
what
i
my
dear
you
were
absolutely
pure
you
said
was
the
condition
yes
and
do
you
see
who
absolutely
if
you
thought
was
you
did
know
me
as
she
spoke
she
heard
the
sharp
click
of
the
latch
as
the
garden
gate
fell
to
she
had
her
back
to
the
window
so
that
she
saw
nothing
but
she
heard
footsteps
that
she
knew
resolute
and
energetic
footsteps
that
hurried
to
their
end
she
felt
the
red
blood
surge
into
her
face
and
saw
that
milly
face
was
white
with
another
passion
and
that
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
figure
of
the
man
who
came
up
the
garden
path
and
without
looking
at
her
milly
answered
i
do
know
now
but
i
think
i
see
my
dear
in
milly
pause
the
rang
violently
milly
rose
and
let
her
have
it
what
was
the
flaw
in
the
crystal
chapter
thirteen
rodney
entered
the
room
and
it
was
then
that
milly
looked
at
her
milly
face
was
no
longer
the
face
of
passion
but
of
sadness
and
reproach
almost
of
recovered
incredulity
it
questioned
rather
than
accused
her
it
said
unmistakably
you
gave
him
up
for
agatha
voice
recalled
her
milly
i
think
you
know
mr
lanyon
rodney
in
acknowledging
milly
presence
did
not
look
at
her
he
saw
nothing
there
but
agatha
face
which
showed
him
at
last
the
expression
that
to
his
eyes
had
always
been
latent
in
it
the
look
of
the
tragic
hidden
soul
of
terror
that
he
had
divined
in
her
he
saw
her
at
last
as
he
had
known
he
should
some
day
see
her
terror
was
no
longer
there
but
it
had
possessed
her
it
had
passed
through
her
and
destroyed
that
other
look
she
had
from
her
lifted
mouth
and
hair
the
look
of
a
thing
borne
on
wings
now
with
her
wings
beaten
with
her
white
face
and
haggard
eyes
he
saw
her
as
a
flying
thing
tracked
down
and
trampled
under
the
feet
of
the
pursuer
he
saw
it
in
one
flash
as
he
stood
there
holding
milly
hand
milly
face
had
no
significance
for
him
he
did
see
it
when
at
last
he
looked
at
her
his
eyes
questioned
her
they
demanded
an
account
from
her
of
what
he
saw
for
agatha
milly
face
prepared
as
it
was
for
remained
charged
with
meaning
it
refused
to
divest
itself
of
reproach
and
of
the
incredulity
that
challenged
her
agatha
rose
to
it
you
not
going
milly
just
because
he
come
you
need
milly
going
he
rose
to
it
also
if
powell
go
like
that
in
that
distressing
way
she
must
at
least
let
him
walk
back
with
her
agatha
would
mind
he
seen
powell
for
ages
he
had
risen
to
such
a
height
that
milly
was
bewildered
by
him
she
let
him
walk
back
with
her
to
the
farm
and
a
little
way
beyond
it
agatha
said
to
milly
at
the
garden
gate
and
watched
them
go
then
she
went
up
into
her
own
room
he
was
gone
so
long
that
she
thought
he
was
never
coming
back
again
she
did
not
want
him
to
come
back
just
yet
but
she
knew
that
she
was
not
afraid
to
see
him
it
did
not
occur
to
her
to
wonder
why
in
spite
of
her
message
he
had
come
nor
why
he
had
come
by
an
earlier
train
than
usual
she
supposed
that
he
must
have
started
before
her
message
could
have
reached
him
all
that
his
coming
or
his
not
coming
mattered
so
little
now
for
now
the
whole
marvellous
thing
was
clear
to
her
she
knew
the
secret
of
the
gift
she
saw
luminously
almost
transparently
the
way
it
worked
milly
had
shown
her
milly
knew
milly
had
seen
she
had
put
her
finger
on
the
flaw
it
was
not
fear
milly
had
been
right
there
too
until
the
moment
when
harding
powell
had
begun
to
get
at
her
agatha
had
never
known
what
fear
felt
like
it
was
the
strain
of
mortality
in
her
love
for
rodney
the
hidden
thing
unforeseen
and
unacknowledged
working
its
work
in
the
darkness
it
had
been
there
all
the
time
undermining
her
secret
sacred
places
it
had
made
the
first
breach
through
which
the
fear
that
was
not
fear
had
entered
she
could
tell
the
very
moment
when
it
happened
she
had
blamed
poor
little
milly
but
it
was
the
flaw
the
flaw
that
had
given
their
deadly
point
to
milly
interference
and
importunity
but
for
the
flaw
they
could
not
have
penetrated
her
profound
serenity
her
gift
might
have
been
trusted
to
dispose
of
them
for
before
that
moment
the
gift
had
worked
indubitably
it
had
never
missed
once
she
looked
back
on
its
wonders
on
the
healing
of
herself
the
first
healing
of
rodney
and
harding
powell
the
healing
of
bella
it
had
worked
with
a
peculiar
rhythm
of
its
own
and
always
in
a
strict
a
measurable
proportion
to
the
purity
of
her
intention
to
harding
case
she
had
brought
nothing
but
innocent
love
and
clean
compassion
to
bella
nothing
but
a
selfless
and
beneficent
desire
to
help
and
because
in
bella
case
at
least
she
had
been
flawless
out
of
the
three
bella
was
the
only
cure
that
had
lasted
it
had
most
marvellously
endured
and
because
of
the
flaw
in
her
she
had
left
harding
worse
than
she
had
found
him
no
wonder
that
poor
milly
had
reproached
her
it
mattered
nothing
that
milly
reproaches
went
too
far
that
in
milly
eyes
she
stood
suspected
of
material
sin
anything
short
of
the
tangible
had
never
been
enough
for
milly
it
mattered
nothing
that
though
milly
might
believe
it
she
had
sinned
only
in
her
thought
for
agatha
who
knew
that
was
enough
more
than
enough
it
counted
more
for
thought
went
wider
and
deeper
than
any
deed
it
was
of
the
very
order
of
the
powers
intangible
wherewith
she
had
worked
why
thoughts
unborn
and
shapeless
that
ran
under
the
threshold
and
hid
there
counted
more
in
that
world
where
it
the
unuttered
the
hidden
and
the
secret
reigned
she
knew
now
that
her
surrender
of
last
night
had
been
the
ultimate
deliverance
she
was
not
afraid
any
more
to
meet
rodney
for
she
had
been
made
pure
from
desire
she
was
safeguarded
forever
he
had
been
gone
about
an
hour
when
she
heard
him
at
the
gate
again
and
in
the
room
below
she
went
down
to
him
he
came
forward
to
meet
her
as
she
entered
he
closed
the
door
behind
them
but
her
eyes
held
them
apart
did
you
not
get
my
wire
she
said
yes
i
got
it
then
why
why
did
i
come
because
i
knew
what
was
happening
i
was
going
to
leave
you
here
for
powell
to
terrify
you
out
of
your
life
surely
you
thought
they
gone
i
knew
they
had
or
you
would
have
wired
but
i
would
i
have
wired
in
any
case
to
put
me
off
to
put
you
off
why
he
questioned
without
divination
or
forewarning
the
veil
of
flesh
was
as
yet
over
his
eyes
so
that
he
could
not
see
because
i
did
mean
that
you
should
come
that
you
should
ever
come
again
rodney
he
smiled
so
you
went
back
on
me
did
you
if
you
call
it
going
back
she
longed
for
him
to
see
that
was
only
because
you
were
frightened
he
said
he
turned
from
her
and
paced
the
room
uneasily
as
if
he
saw
presently
he
drew
up
by
the
hearth
and
stood
there
for
a
moment
puzzling
it
out
and
she
thought
that
he
had
seen
he
had
he
faced
her
with
a
smile
again
but
it
was
no
good
dear
was
it
as
if
i
would
know
what
it
meant
you
would
have
done
it
if
you
had
been
you
lost
your
nerve
no
wonder
with
those
powells
preying
on
you
body
and
soul
for
weeks
no
rodney
no
i
did
you
to
come
back
and
i
think
now
it
would
be
better
if
you
did
stay
it
seemed
to
her
now
that
perhaps
he
had
seen
and
was
fighting
what
he
saw
i
not
going
to
stay
he
said
i
am
going
in
another
hour
to
take
powell
away
somewhere
he
took
it
up
where
she
had
made
him
leave
it
then
agatha
i
shall
come
back
again
i
shall
come
back
let
me
see
on
sunday
she
swept
that
aside
where
are
you
going
to
take
him
to
a
man
i
know
who
look
after
him
oh
rodney
it
break
milly
heart
she
had
come
in
her
agitation
to
where
he
stood
she
sat
on
the
couch
by
the
corner
of
the
hearth
and
he
looked
down
at
her
there
no
he
said
it
wo
it
give
him
a
chance
to
get
all
right
convinced
her
it
the
only
thing
to
do
he
ca
be
left
here
for
you
to
look
after
did
she
tell
you
she
would
have
told
me
a
thing
if
i
had
made
her
i
dragged
it
out
of
her
bit
by
bit
rodney
that
was
cruel
of
you
was
it
i
do
care
i
have
done
it
if
she
bled
what
did
she
tell
you
pretty
nearly
everything
i
imagine
quite
enough
for
me
to
see
what
between
them
they
been
doing
to
you
did
she
tell
you
he
got
he
did
not
answer
all
at
once
it
was
as
if
he
drew
back
before
the
question
alien
and
disturbed
shirking
the
discerned
yet
unintelligible
issue
did
she
tell
you
rodney
agatha
repeated
well
yes
she
me
he
seemed
to
be
making
reluctantly
some
admission
he
sat
down
beside
her
and
his
movement
had
the
air
of
ending
the
discussion
but
he
did
not
look
at
her
what
do
you
make
of
it
she
said
this
time
he
winced
visibly
i
do
make
anything
if
it
happened
if
it
happened
like
agatha
it
did
happen
well
i
admit
it
was
uncommonly
queer
he
left
it
there
and
reverted
to
his
theme
but
it
no
wonder
if
you
sat
down
to
that
for
six
weeks
it
no
wonder
you
got
scared
it
inconceivable
to
me
how
that
woman
could
have
let
you
in
for
him
she
knew
what
he
was
she
did
know
what
i
was
doing
till
it
was
done
she
no
business
to
let
you
go
on
with
it
when
she
did
know
ah
but
she
knew
then
that
it
was
all
right
all
right
absolutely
right
rodney
she
called
to
him
as
if
she
would
compel
him
to
see
it
as
it
was
i
did
no
more
for
him
than
i
did
for
you
and
bella
he
started
bella
he
repeated
he
stared
at
her
he
had
seen
something
you
wondered
how
she
got
all
right
did
you
he
said
nothing
that
was
how
and
still
he
did
not
speak
he
sat
there
leaning
forward
staring
now
at
his
own
clasped
hands
he
looked
as
if
he
bowed
himself
before
the
irrefutable
and
there
was
you
too
before
that
i
know
he
said
then
i
can
understand
but
why
bella
because
bella
was
the
only
way
she
had
not
followed
his
thoughts
nor
he
hers
the
only
way
he
said
to
work
it
to
keep
the
thing
pure
i
had
to
be
certain
of
my
motive
and
i
knew
that
if
i
could
give
bella
back
to
you
that
would
prove
to
me
i
mean
that
it
was
pure
but
bella
he
said
softly
bella
powell
i
can
understand
and
me
it
was
clear
that
he
could
get
over
all
the
rest
but
he
could
not
get
over
bella
bella
case
convinced
him
bella
case
could
not
be
explained
away
or
set
aside
before
bella
case
he
was
baffled
utterly
defeated
he
faced
it
with
a
certain
awe
you
were
right
after
all
about
bella
he
said
at
last
and
so
was
i
she
did
care
for
me
as
i
told
you
but
she
does
care
now
she
knew
it
that
was
what
i
was
trying
for
she
said
that
was
what
i
meant
you
meant
it
it
was
the
only
way
that
why
i
did
want
you
to
come
back
he
sat
silent
taking
that
in
do
you
see
now
how
it
works
you
have
to
be
pure
crystal
why
i
did
want
you
to
come
back
obscurely
through
the
veil
of
flesh
he
saw
and
i
am
never
to
come
back
he
said
you
will
not
need
to
come
you
mean
you
wo
want
me
no
i
shall
not
want
you
because
when
i
did
want
you
it
broke
down
he
smiled
i
see
when
you
want
me
it
breaks
down
he
rallied
for
a
moment
he
made
his
one
last
pitiful
stand
against
the
supernatural
thing
that
was
conquering
him
he
had
risen
to
go
and
when
want
to
come
when
i
long
for
you
what
then
longing
will
make
no
difference
she
smiled
also
as
if
she
foresaw
how
it
would
work
and
that
soon
very
soon
he
would
cease
to
long
for
her
his
hand
was
on
the
door
he
smiled
back
at
her
i
do
want
to
shake
your
faith
in
it
he
said
you
ca
shake
my
faith
in
it
still
it
breaks
down
it
breaks
down
he
cried
never
you
do
understand
she
said
it
was
the
flaw
in
the
crystal
soon
very
soon
he
would
know
it
already
he
had
shown
submission
she
had
no
doubt
of
the
working
of
the
power
bella
remained
as
a
sign
that
it
had
once
been
and
that
given
the
flawless
crystal
it
should
be
again
