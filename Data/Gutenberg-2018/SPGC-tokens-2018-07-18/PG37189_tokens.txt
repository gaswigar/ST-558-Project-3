lay
there
in
the
confiding
relaxation
of
a
child
facing
page
give
it
a
brush
now
and
then
like
a
good
soul
she
would
get
into

was

chapter
i
ah
do
begin
to
fuss
wailed
kitty
if
a
woman
began
to
worry
in
these
days
because
her
husband
had
written
to
her
for
a
fortnight
besides
if
he
been
anywhere
interesting
anywhere
where
the
fighting
was
really
hot
he
have
found
some
way
of
telling
me
instead
of
just
leaving
it
as
in
france
he
be
all
right
we
were
sitting
in
the
nursery
i
had
not
meant
to
enter
it
again
now
that
the
child
was
dead
but
i
had
come
suddenly
on
kitty
as
she
slipped
the
key
into
the
lock
and
i
had
lingered
to
look
in
at
the
high
room
so
full
of
whiteness
and
clear
colors
so
unendurably
gay
and
familiar
which
is
kept
in
all
respects
as
though
there
were
still
a
child
in
the
house
it
was
the
first
lavish
day
of
spring
and
the
sunlight
was
pouring
through
the
tall
arched
windows
and
the
flowered
curtains
so
brightly
that
in
the
old
days
a
fat
fist
would
certainly
have
been
raised
to
point
out
the
new
translucent
glories
of
the
rosebud
sunlight
was
lying
in
great
pools
on
the
blue
cork
floor
and
the
soft
rugs
patterned
with
strange
beasts
and
threw
dancing
beams
which
should
have
been
gravely
watched
for
hours
on
the
white
paint
and
the
blue
distempered
walls
it
fell
on
the
which
had
been
chris
idea
of
an
appropriate
present
for
his
son
and
showed
what
a
fine
fellow
he
was
and
how
tremendously
dappled
it
picked
out
mary
and
her
little
lamb
on
the
chintz
ottoman
and
along
the
mantelpiece
under
the
loved
print
of
the
snarling
tiger
in
attitudes
that
were
at
once
angular
and
relaxed
as
though
they
were
ready
for
play
at
their
master
pleasure
but
found
it
hard
to
keep
from
drowsing
in
this
warm
weather
sat
the
teddy
bear
and
the
chimpanzee
and
the
woolly
white
dog
and
the
black
cat
with
eyes
that
roll
everything
was
there
except
oliver
i
turned
away
so
that
i
might
not
spy
on
kitty
revisiting
her
dead
but
she
called
after
me
come
here
jenny
i
going
to
dry
my
hair
and
when
i
looked
again
i
saw
that
her
golden
hair
was
all
about
her
shoulders
and
that
she
wore
over
her
frock
a
little
silken
jacket
trimmed
with
rosebuds
she
looked
so
like
a
girl
on
a
magazine
cover
that
one
expected
to
find
a
large
cents
somewhere
attached
to
her
person
she
had
taken
nanny
big
from
its
place
by
the
and
was
pushing
it
over
to
the
middle
window
i
always
come
in
here
when
emery
has
washed
my
hair
it
the
sunniest
room
in
the
house
i
wish
chris
would
have
it
kept
as
a
nursery
when
there
no
chance
she
sat
down
swept
her
hair
over
the
back
of
the
chair
into
the
sunlight
and
held
out
to
me
her
tortoiseshell
give
it
a
brush
now
and
then
like
a
good
soul
but
be
careful
tortoise
snaps
so
i
took
the
brush
and
turned
to
the
window
leaning
my
forehead
against
the
glass
and
staring
unobservantly
at
the
view
you
probably
know
the
beauty
of
that
view
for
when
chris
rebuilt
baldry
court
after
his
marriage
he
handed
it
over
to
architects
who
had
not
so
much
the
wild
eye
of
the
artist
as
the
knowing
wink
of
the
manicurist
and
between
them
they
massaged
the
dear
old
place
into
matter
for
innumerable
photographs
in
the
illustrated
papers
the
house
lies
on
the
crest
of
harrowweald
and
from
its
windows
the
eye
drops
to
miles
of
emerald
lying
wet
and
brilliant
under
a
westward
line
of
sleek
hills
blue
with
distance
and
distant
woods
while
nearer
it
range
the
suave
decorum
of
the
lawn
and
the
lebanon
cedar
the
branches
of
which
are
like
darkness
made
palpable
and
the
minatory
gauntnesses
of
the
topmost
pines
in
the
wood
that
breaks
downward
its
bare
boughs
a
close
texture
of
browns
and
purples
from
the
pond
on
the
edge
of
the
hill
illustration
give
it
a
brush
now
and
then
like
a
good
soul
that
day
its
beauty
was
an
affront
to
me
because
like
most
englishwomen
of
my
time
i
was
wishing
for
the
return
of
a
soldier
disregarding
the
national
interest
and
everything
else
except
the
keen
prehensile
gesture
of
our
hearts
toward
him
i
wanted
to
snatch
my
cousin
christopher
from
the
wars
and
seal
him
in
this
green
pleasantness
his
wife
and
i
now
looked
upon
of
late
i
had
had
bad
dreams
about
him
by
nights
i
saw
chris
running
across
the
brown
rottenness
of
starting
back
here
because
he
trod
upon
a
hand
not
even
looking
there
because
of
the
awfulness
of
an
unburied
head
and
not
till
my
dream
was
packed
full
of
horror
did
i
see
him
pitch
forward
on
his
knees
as
he
reached
safety
if
it
was
that
for
on
the
i
have
seen
men
slip
down
as
softly
from
the
and
none
but
the
grimmer
philosophers
could
say
that
they
had
reached
safety
by
their
fall
and
when
i
escaped
into
wakefulness
it
was
only
to
lie
stiff
and
think
of
stories
i
had
heard
in
the
boyish
voice
of
the
modern
subaltern
which
rings
indomitable
yet
has
most
of
its
gay
notes
flattened
we
were
all
of
us
in
a
barn
one
night
and
a
shell
came
along
my
pal
sang
out
me
old
man
i
got
no
legs
and
i
had
to
answer
ca
old
man
i
got
no
hands
well
such
are
the
dreams
of
englishwomen
i
could
not
complain
but
i
wished
for
the
return
of
our
soldier
so
i
said
i
wish
we
could
hear
from
chris
it
is
a
fortnight
since
he
wrote
and
then
it
was
that
kitty
wailed
ah
do
begin
to
fuss
and
bent
over
her
image
in
a
as
one
might
bend
for
refreshment
over
scented
flowers
i
tried
to
build
about
me
such
a
little
globe
of
ease
as
always
ensphered
her
and
thought
of
all
that
remained
good
in
our
lives
though
chris
was
gone
i
was
sure
that
we
were
preserved
from
the
reproach
of
luxury
because
we
had
made
a
fine
place
for
chris
one
little
part
of
the
world
that
was
so
far
as
surfaces
could
make
it
so
good
enough
for
his
amazing
goodness
here
we
had
nourished
that
surpassing
amiability
which
was
so
habitual
that
one
took
it
as
one
of
his
physical
characteristics
and
regarded
any
lapse
into
bad
temper
as
a
calamity
as
startling
as
the
breaking
of
a
leg
here
we
had
made
happiness
inevitable
for
him
i
could
shut
my
eyes
and
think
of
innumerable
proofs
of
how
well
we
had
succeeded
for
there
never
was
so
visibly
contented
a
man
and
i
recalled
all
that
he
did
one
morning
just
a
year
ago
when
he
went
to
the
front
first
he
had
sat
in
the
and
talked
and
stared
out
on
the
lawns
that
already
had
the
desolation
of
an
empty
stage
although
he
had
not
yet
gone
then
broke
off
suddenly
and
went
about
the
house
looking
into
many
rooms
he
went
to
the
stables
and
looked
at
the
horses
and
had
the
dogs
brought
out
he
refrained
from
touching
them
or
speaking
to
them
as
though
he
felt
himself
already
infected
with
the
squalor
of
war
and
did
not
want
to
contaminate
their
bright
physical
then
he
went
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
stood
staring
down
into
the
clumps
of
rhododendrons
and
the
yellow
tangle
of
last
bracken
and
the
cold
winter
black
of
the
trees
from
this
very
window
i
had
spied
on
him
then
he
moved
broodingly
back
to
the
house
to
be
with
his
wife
until
the
moment
of
his
going
when
kitty
and
i
stood
on
the
steps
to
see
him
motor
off
to
waterloo
he
kissed
us
both
as
he
bent
over
me
i
noticed
once
again
how
his
hair
was
of
two
colors
brown
and
gold
then
he
got
into
the
car
put
on
his
tommy
air
and
said
so
long
i
write
you
from
berlin
and
as
he
spoke
his
head
dropped
back
and
he
set
a
hard
stare
on
the
house
that
meant
i
knew
that
he
loved
the
life
he
had
lived
with
us
and
desired
to
carry
with
him
to
the
dreary
place
of
death
and
dirt
the
complete
memory
of
everything
about
his
home
on
which
his
mind
could
brush
when
things
were
at
their
worst
as
a
man
might
finger
an
amulet
through
his
shirt
this
house
this
life
with
us
was
the
core
of
his
heart
if
he
could
come
back
i
said
he
was
so
happy
here
and
kitty
answered
he
could
not
have
been
happier
it
was
important
that
he
should
have
been
happy
for
you
see
he
was
not
like
other
city
men
when
we
had
played
together
as
children
in
that
wood
he
had
always
shown
great
faith
in
the
imminence
of
the
improbable
he
thought
that
the
would
really
stir
and
shrink
and
quicken
into
an
enchanted
princess
that
he
really
was
a
red
indian
and
that
his
disguise
would
suddenly
fall
from
him
at
the
right
sundown
that
at
any
moment
a
tiger
might
lift
red
fangs
through
the
bracken
and
he
expected
these
things
with
a
stronger
motion
of
the
imagination
than
the
ordinary
child
and
from
a
thousand
intimations
from
his
occasional
clear
fixity
of
gaze
on
good
things
as
though
they
were
about
to
dissolve
into
better
from
the
passionate
anticipation
with
which
he
went
to
new
countries
or
met
new
people
i
was
aware
that
this
faith
had
persisted
into
his
adult
life
he
had
exchanged
his
expectation
of
becoming
a
red
indian
for
the
equally
wistful
aspiration
of
becoming
completely
reconciled
to
life
it
was
his
hopeless
hope
that
some
time
he
would
have
an
experience
that
would
act
on
his
life
like
alchemy
turning
to
gold
all
the
dark
metals
of
events
and
from
that
revelation
he
would
go
on
his
way
rich
with
an
inextinguishable
joy
there
had
been
of
course
no
chance
of
his
ever
getting
it
literally
there
was
room
to
swing
a
revelation
in
his
crowded
life
first
of
all
at
his
father
death
he
had
been
obliged
to
take
over
a
business
that
was
weighted
by
the
needs
of
a
mob
of
female
relatives
who
were
all
useless
either
in
the
old
way
with
antimacassars
or
in
the
new
way
with
then
kitty
had
come
along
and
picked
up
his
conception
of
normal
expenditure
and
carelessly
stretched
it
as
a
woman
stretches
a
new
glove
on
her
hand
then
there
had
been
the
difficult
task
of
learning
to
live
after
the
death
of
his
little
son
it
had
lain
on
us
the
responsibility
which
gave
us
dignity
to
compensate
him
for
his
lack
of
free
adventure
by
arranging
him
a
gracious
life
but
now
just
because
our
performance
had
been
so
brilliantly
adequate
how
dreary
was
the
empty
stage
we
were
not
perhaps
specially
contemptible
women
because
nothing
could
ever
really
become
a
part
of
our
life
until
it
had
been
referred
to
chris
attention
i
remember
thinking
as
the
came
in
with
a
card
on
the
tray
how
little
it
mattered
who
had
called
and
what
flag
of
prettiness
or
wit
she
flew
since
there
was
no
chance
that
chris
would
come
in
and
stand
over
her
his
fairness
red
in
the
firelight
and
show
her
that
detached
attention
such
as
an
unmusical
man
pays
to
good
music
which
men
of
anchored
affections
give
to
attractive
women
kitty
read
from
the
card
william
grey
mariposa
ladysmith
road
wealdstone
i
do
know
anybody
in
that
is
the
name
of
the
red
suburban
stain
which
fouls
the
fields
three
miles
nearer
london
than
harrowweald
one
can
not
now
protect
one
environment
as
one
once
could
do
i
know
her
ward
has
she
been
here
before
oh
no
the
smiled
superciliously
she
said
she
had
news
for
you
from
her
tone
one
could
deduce
an
explanation
made
by
a
shabby
visitor
while
using
the
almost
too
zealously
kitty
pondered
then
said
i
come
down
as
the
girl
went
kitty
took
up
the
amber
from
her
lap
and
began
swathing
her
hair
about
her
head
last
fashion
she
commented
but
i
fancy
it
do
for
a
person
with
that
sort
of
address
she
stood
up
and
threw
her
little
silk
over
the
i
seeing
her
because
she
may
need
something
and
i
specially
want
to
be
kind
to
people
while
chris
is
away
one
wants
to
deserve
well
of
heaven
for
a
minute
she
was
aloof
in
radiance
but
as
we
linked
arms
and
went
out
into
the
corridor
she
became
more
mortal
with
a
pout
the
people
that
come
breaking
into
one
nice
quiet
day
she
moaned
reproachfully
and
as
we
came
to
the
head
of
the
broad
she
leaned
over
the
white
balustrade
to
peer
down
on
the
hall
and
squeezed
my
arm
look
she
whispered
just
beneath
us
in
one
of
kitty
prettiest
chintz
sat
a
woman
she
wore
a
yellowish
raincoat
and
a
black
hat
with
plumes
the
sticky
straw
hat
had
only
lately
been
renovated
by
something
out
of
a
little
bottle
bought
at
the
chemist
she
had
rolled
her
black
thread
gloves
into
a
ball
on
her
lap
so
that
she
could
turn
her
gray
alpaca
skirt
well
above
her
muddy
boots
and
adjust
its
with
a
seamed
red
hand
that
looked
even
more
worn
when
she
presently
raised
it
to
touch
the
glistening
flowers
of
the
pink
azalea
that
stood
on
a
table
beside
her
kitty
shivered
then
muttered
let
get
this
over
and
ran
down
the
stairs
on
the
last
step
she
paused
and
said
with
conscientious
sweetness
mrs
grey
yes
answered
the
visitor
she
lifted
to
kitty
a
sallow
and
relaxed
face
the
expression
of
which
gave
me
a
sharp
pitying
pang
of
prepossession
in
her
favor
it
was
beautiful
that
so
plain
a
woman
should
so
ardently
rejoice
in
another
loveliness
are
you
mrs
baldry
she
asked
almost
as
if
she
were
glad
about
it
and
stood
up
the
bones
of
her
bad
stays
clicked
as
she
moved
well
she
was
not
so
bad
her
body
was
long
and
round
and
shapely
and
with
a
noble
squareness
of
the
shoulders
her
fair
hair
curled
diffidently
about
a
good
brow
her
gray
eyes
though
they
were
remote
as
if
anything
worth
looking
at
in
her
life
had
kept
a
long
way
off
were
full
of
tenderness
and
though
she
was
slender
there
was
something
about
her
of
the
wholesome
endearing
heaviness
of
the
ox
or
the
trusted
big
dog
yet
she
was
bad
enough
she
was
repulsively
furred
with
neglect
and
poverty
as
even
a
good
glove
that
has
dropped
down
behind
a
bed
in
a
hotel
and
has
lain
undisturbed
for
a
day
or
two
is
repulsive
when
the
chambermaid
retrieves
it
from
the
dust
and
fluff
she
flung
at
us
as
we
sat
down
my
general
maid
is
sister
to
your
second
housemaid
it
left
us
at
a
loss
you
come
about
a
reference
asked
kitty
oh
no
i
had
gladys
two
years
now
and
i
always
found
her
a
very
good
girl
i
want
no
reference
with
her
she
followed
the
burst
seam
of
the
dark
pigskin
purse
that
slid
about
on
her
shiny
alpaca
lap
but
girls
talk
you
know
you
must
blame
them
she
seemed
to
be
caught
in
a
thicket
of
embarrassment
and
sat
staring
up
at
the
azalea
with
the
hardness
of
a
woman
who
sees
before
her
the
curse
of
lives
a
domestic
row
kitty
said
that
she
took
no
interest
in
gossip
oh
it
is
her
eyes
brimmed
as
though
we
had
been
unkind
servants
gossip
that
i
wanted
to
talk
about
i
only
mentioned
gladys
she
continued
to
trace
the
burst
seam
of
her
purse
because
that
how
i
heard
you
did
know
what
do
i
know
her
head
drooped
a
little
about
baldry
forgive
me
i
do
know
his
rank
captain
baldry
supplied
kitty
wonderingly
what
is
it
that
i
know
she
looked
far
away
from
us
to
the
open
door
and
its
view
of
dark
pines
and
pale
march
sunshine
and
appeared
to
swallow
something
why
that
he
hurt
she
gently
said
wounded
you
mean
asked
kitty
her
rusty
plumes
oscillated
as
she
moved
her
mild
face
about
with
an
air
of
perplexity
yes
she
said
he
wounded
kitty
bright
eyes
met
mine
and
we
obeyed
that
mysterious
human
impulse
to
smile
triumphantly
at
the
spectacle
of
a
occupied
in
baseness
for
this
news
was
not
true
it
could
not
possibly
be
true
the
war
office
would
have
wired
to
us
immediately
if
chris
had
been
wounded
this
was
such
a
fraud
as
one
sees
recorded
in
the
papers
that
meticulously
record
squalor
in
paragraphs
headed
heartless
fraud
on
soldier
wife
presently
she
would
say
that
she
had
gone
to
some
expense
to
come
here
with
her
news
and
that
she
was
poor
and
at
the
first
generous
look
on
our
faces
there
would
come
some
tale
of
trouble
that
would
disgust
the
imagination
by
pictures
of
furniture
that
a
landlord
oddly
desired
to
seize
and
a
pallid
child
with
bandages
round
its
throat
i
cast
down
my
eyes
and
shivered
at
the
horror
yet
there
was
something
about
the
physical
quality
of
the
woman
unlovely
though
she
was
which
preserved
the
occasion
from
utter
baseness
i
felt
sure
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
tyrannous
emptiness
of
that
evil
shiny
pigskin
purse
that
jerked
about
on
her
trembling
knees
the
poor
driven
creature
would
have
chosen
ways
of
candor
and
gentleness
it
was
strangely
enough
only
when
i
looked
at
kitty
and
marked
how
her
brightly
colored
prettiness
arched
over
this
plain
criminal
as
though
she
were
a
splendid
bird
of
prey
and
this
her
sluggish
insect
food
that
i
felt
the
moment
degrading
kitty
was
i
felt
being
a
little
too
clever
over
it
how
is
he
wounded
she
asked
the
caller
traced
a
pattern
on
the
carpet
with
her
blunt
toe
i
do
know
how
to
put
it
he
not
exactly
wounded
a
shell
burst
concussion
suggested
kitty
she
answered
with
an
odd
glibness
and
humility
as
though
tendering
us
a
term
she
had
long
brooded
over
without
arriving
at
comprehension
and
hoping
that
our
superior
intelligences
would
make
something
of
it
our
faces
did
not
illumine
so
she
dragged
on
lamely
anyway
he
not
well
again
she
played
with
her
purse
her
face
was
visibly
damp
not
well
is
he
dangerously
ill
oh
no
she
was
too
kind
to
harrow
us
not
dangerously
kitty
brutally
permitted
a
silence
to
fall
our
caller
could
not
bear
it
and
broke
it
in
a
voice
that
nervousness
had
turned
to
a
funny
diffident
croak
he
in
the
queen
mary
hospital
at
boulogne
we
did
not
speak
and
she
began
to
flush
and
wriggle
on
her
seat
and
stooped
forward
to
fumble
under
the
legs
of
her
chair
for
her
umbrella
the
sight
of
its
green
seams
and
unveracious
tortoiseshell
handle
disgusted
kitty
into
speech
how
do
you
know
all
this
our
visitor
met
her
eyes
this
was
evidently
a
moment
for
which
she
had
steeled
herself
and
she
rose
to
it
with
a
catch
of
her
breath
a
man
who
used
to
be
a
clerk
along
with
my
husband
is
in
regiment
her
voice
croaked
even
more
piteously
and
her
eyes
begged
leave
it
at
that
leave
it
at
that
if
you
only
knew
and
what
regiment
is
that
pursued
kitty
the
poor
sallow
face
shone
with
sweat
i
never
thought
to
ask
she
said
well
your
friend
name
grey
moved
on
her
seat
so
suddenly
and
violently
that
the
pigskin
purse
fell
from
her
lap
and
lay
at
my
feet
i
supposed
that
she
cast
it
from
her
purposely
because
its
emptiness
had
brought
her
to
this
humiliation
and
that
the
scene
would
close
presently
in
a
few
quiet
tears
i
hoped
that
kitty
would
let
her
go
without
scarring
her
too
much
with
words
and
would
not
mind
if
i
gave
her
a
little
money
there
was
no
doubt
in
my
mind
but
that
this
queer
ugly
episode
in
which
this
woman
butted
like
a
clumsy
animal
at
a
gate
she
was
not
intelligent
enough
to
open
would
dissolve
and
be
replaced
by
some
more
pleasing
composition
in
which
we
would
take
our
proper
parts
in
which
that
is
she
would
turn
from
our
rightness
ashamed
yet
she
cried
but
chris
is
ill
it
took
only
a
second
for
the
compact
insolence
of
the
moment
to
penetrate
the
amazing
impertinence
of
the
use
of
his
name
the
accusation
of
callousness
she
brought
against
us
whose
passion
for
chris
was
our
point
of
honor
because
we
would
not
shriek
at
her
false
news
the
impudently
bright
indignant
gaze
she
flung
at
us
the
lift
of
her
voice
that
pretended
she
could
not
understand
our
coolness
and
irrelevance
i
pushed
the
purse
away
from
me
with
my
toe
and
hated
her
as
the
rich
hate
the
poor
as
insect
things
that
will
struggle
out
of
the
crannies
which
are
their
decent
home
and
introduce
ugliness
to
the
light
of
day
and
kitty
said
in
a
voice
shaken
with
pitilessness
you
are
impertinent
i
know
exactly
what
you
are
doing
you
have
read
in
the
observer
or
somewhere
that
my
husband
is
at
the
front
and
you
come
to
tell
this
story
because
you
think
that
you
will
get
some
money
i
read
of
such
cases
in
the
papers
you
forget
that
if
anything
had
happened
to
my
husband
the
war
office
would
have
told
me
you
should
think
yourself
very
lucky
that
i
do
hand
you
over
to
the
police
she
shrilled
a
little
before
she
came
to
the
end
please
go
kitty
i
breathed
i
was
so
ashamed
that
such
a
scene
should
spring
from
chris
peril
at
the
front
that
i
wanted
to
go
out
into
the
garden
and
sit
by
the
pond
until
the
poor
thing
had
removed
her
deplorable
umbrella
her
unpardonable
raincoat
her
poor
frustrated
fraud
but
grey
who
had
begun
childishly
and
deliberately
it
who
are
being
and
had
desisted
simply
because
she
realized
that
there
were
no
harsh
notes
on
her
lyre
and
that
she
could
not
strike
these
chords
that
others
found
so
easy
had
fixed
me
with
a
certain
wet
clear
patient
gaze
it
is
the
gift
of
animals
and
those
of
peasant
stock
from
the
least
regarded
from
an
old
horse
nosing
over
a
gate
or
a
drab
in
a
ward
it
wrings
the
heart
from
this
woman
i
said
checkingly
kitty
and
reconciled
her
in
an
undertone
there
some
mistake
got
the
name
wrong
perhaps
please
tell
us
all
about
it
grey
began
a
forward
movement
like
a
curtsy
she
was
groveling
after
that
purse
when
she
rose
her
face
was
pink
from
stooping
and
her
dignity
swam
uncertainly
in
a
sea
of
tears
she
said
i
sorry
i
upset
you
but
when
you
know
a
thing
like
that
it
in
flesh
and
blood
to
keep
it
from
his
wife
i
am
a
married
woman
myself
and
i
know
i
knew
baldry
fifteen
years
ago
her
voice
freely
confessed
that
she
had
taken
a
liberty
quite
a
friend
of
the
family
he
was
she
had
added
that
touch
to
soften
the
crude
surprisingness
of
her
announcement
it
hardly
did
we
lost
sight
of
each
other
it
fifteen
years
since
we
last
met
i
had
never
seen
nor
heard
of
him
nor
thought
to
do
again
till
i
got
this
a
week
ago
she
undid
the
purse
and
took
out
a
telegram
i
knew
suddenly
that
all
she
said
was
true
for
that
was
why
her
hands
had
clasped
that
purse
he
is
well
he
is
well
she
said
pleadingly
he
lost
his
memory
and
thinks
thinks
he
still
knows
me
she
passed
the
telegram
to
kitty
who
read
it
and
laid
it
on
her
knee
see
said
grey
it
addressed
to
margaret
allington
my
maiden
name
and
i
been
married
these
ten
years
and
it
was
sent
to
my
old
home
monkey
island
at
bray
father
kept
the
inn
there
it
fifteen
years
since
we
left
it
i
never
should
have
got
this
telegram
if
me
and
my
husband
had
been
down
there
last
september
and
told
the
folks
who
keep
it
now
who
i
was
kitty
folded
up
the
telegram
and
said
in
a
little
voice
this
is
a
likely
story
again
grey
eyes
brimmed
people
are
rude
to
one
she
visibly
said
but
surely
not
nice
people
like
this
she
simply
continued
to
sit
kitty
cried
out
as
though
arguing
there
nothing
about
in
this
wire
our
visitor
melted
into
a
trembling
shyness
there
was
a
letter
too
kitty
held
out
her
hand
she
gasped
oh
no
i
could
do
that
i
must
have
it
said
kitty
the
caller
eyes
grew
great
she
rose
and
dived
clumsily
for
her
umbrella
which
had
again
slipped
under
the
chair
i
ca
she
cried
and
scurried
to
the
open
door
like
a
pelted
dog
she
would
have
run
down
the
steps
at
once
had
not
some
tender
thought
arrested
her
she
turned
to
me
trustfully
and
stammered
he
is
at
that
hospital
i
said
as
if
since
i
had
dealt
her
no
direct
blow
i
might
be
able
to
salve
the
news
she
brought
from
the
general
wreck
of
manners
and
then
kitty
stiff
pallor
struck
to
her
heart
and
cried
comfortingly
across
the
distance
i
tell
you
i
have
seen
him
for
fifteen
years
she
faced
about
pushed
down
her
hat
on
her
head
and
ran
down
the
steps
to
the
gravel
they
wo
understand
we
heard
her
sob
for
a
long
time
we
watched
her
as
she
went
along
the
drive
her
yellowish
raincoat
looking
sick
and
bright
in
the
sharp
sunshine
her
black
plumes
nodding
like
the
pines
above
her
cheap
boots
making
her
walk
on
her
heels
a
spreading
stain
on
the
fabric
of
our
life
when
she
was
quite
hidden
by
the
dark
clump
of
rhododendrons
at
the
corner
kitty
turned
and
went
to
the
fireplace
she
laid
her
arms
against
the
oak
and
cooled
her
face
against
her
arms
when
at
last
i
followed
her
she
said
do
you
believe
her
i
started
i
had
forgotten
that
we
had
ever
disbelieved
her
yes
i
replied
what
can
it
mean
she
dropped
her
arms
and
stared
at
me
imploringly
think
think
of
something
it
can
mean
which
is
detestable
it
all
a
mystery
i
said
and
added
madly
because
nobody
had
ever
been
cross
with
kitty
you
did
help
to
clear
it
up
oh
i
know
you
think
i
was
rude
she
petulantly
moaned
but
so
slow
you
do
see
what
it
means
either
it
means
that
he
mad
our
chris
our
splendid
sane
chris
all
broken
and
queer
not
knowing
us
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
that
it
ca
be
true
but
if
he
is
jenny
there
was
nothing
in
that
telegram
to
show
he
lost
his
memory
it
was
just
affection
a
name
that
might
have
been
a
pet
name
things
that
it
was
a
little
common
to
put
in
a
telegram
it
queer
he
should
have
written
such
a
message
queer
that
he
should
have
told
me
about
knowing
her
queer
that
he
ever
should
have
known
such
a
woman
it
shows
there
are
bits
of
him
we
do
know
things
may
be
awfully
wrong
all
such
a
breach
of
trust
i
resent
it
i
was
appalled
by
these
stiff
dignified
gestures
that
seemed
to
be
plucking
chris
soul
from
his
body
tormented
though
it
was
by
this
unknown
calamity
but
chris
is
ill
i
cried
she
stared
at
me
you
saying
what
she
said
indeed
there
seemed
no
better
words
than
those
grey
had
used
i
repeated
but
he
is
ill
she
laid
her
face
against
her
arms
again
what
does
that
matter
she
wailed
if
he
could
send
that
telegram
he
is
no
longer
ours
chapter
ii
i
was
sorry
the
next
morning
that
the
post
comes
too
late
at
harrowweald
to
be
brought
up
with
the
morning
tea
and
waits
for
one
at
the
breakfast
table
for
under
kitty
fixed
gaze
i
had
to
open
a
letter
which
bore
the
boulogne
postmark
and
was
addressed
in
the
writing
of
frank
baldry
chris
cousin
who
is
in
the
church
he
wrote
dear
jenny
you
will
have
to
break
it
to
kitty
and
try
to
make
her
take
it
as
quietly
as
possible
this
sentence
will
sound
ominous
as
a
start
but
i
so
full
of
the
extraordinary
thing
that
has
happened
to
chris
that
i
feel
as
if
every
living
creature
was
in
possession
of
the
facts
i
do
know
how
much
you
know
about
it
so
i
better
begin
at
the
beginning
last
thursday
i
got
a
wire
from
chris
saying
that
he
had
had
concussion
though
not
seriously
and
was
in
a
hospital
about
a
mile
from
boulogne
where
he
would
be
glad
to
see
me
it
struck
me
as
odd
that
it
had
been
sent
to
ollenshaws
where
i
was
curate
fifteen
years
ago
fortunately
i
have
always
kept
in
touch
with
sumpter
whom
i
regard
as
a
specimen
of
the
very
best
type
of
country
clergymen
and
he
forwarded
it
without
unnecessary
delay
i
started
that
evening
and
looked
hard
for
you
and
kitty
on
the
boat
but
came
to
the
conclusion
i
should
probably
find
you
at
the
hospital
after
having
breakfasted
in
the
town
how
superior
french
cooking
is
i
would
have
looked
in
vain
for
such
coffee
such
an
omelet
in
my
own
parish
i
went
off
to
look
for
the
hospital
it
is
a
school
which
has
been
taken
over
by
the
red
cross
with
grounds
and
plenty
of
nice
dry
paths
under
the
i
could
not
see
chris
for
an
hour
so
i
sat
down
on
a
bench
by
a
funny
little
round
pond
with
a
stone
coping
very
french
some
wounded
soldiers
who
came
out
to
sit
in
the
sun
were
rather
rude
because
i
was
not
in
khaki
even
when
i
explained
that
i
was
a
priest
of
god
and
that
the
feeling
of
the
bishops
was
strongly
against
the
enlistment
of
the
clergy
i
do
feel
that
the
church
has
lost
its
grip
on
the
masses
then
a
nurse
came
out
and
took
me
in
to
see
chris
he
is
in
a
nice
room
with
a
southern
exposure
with
three
other
officers
who
seemed
very
decent
not
the
new
army
i
am
glad
to
say
he
was
better
than
i
had
expected
but
did
not
look
quite
himself
for
one
thing
he
was
oddly
boisterous
he
seemed
glad
to
see
me
and
told
me
he
could
remember
nothing
about
his
concussion
but
that
he
wanted
to
get
back
to
harrowweald
he
talked
a
lot
about
the
wood
and
the
upper
pond
and
wanted
to
know
if
the
daffies
were
out
yet
and
when
he
would
be
allowed
to
travel
because
he
felt
that
he
would
get
well
at
once
if
only
he
could
get
home
and
then
he
was
silent
for
a
minute
as
though
he
was
holding
something
back
it
will
perhaps
help
you
to
realize
the
difficulty
of
my
position
when
you
understand
that
all
this
happened
before
i
had
been
in
the
room
five
minutes
without
flickering
an
eyelid
quite
easily
and
naturally
he
gave
me
the
surprising
information
that
he
was
in
love
with
a
girl
called
margaret
allington
who
is
the
daughter
of
a
man
who
keeps
the
inn
on
monkey
island
at
bray
on
the
thames
he
uttered
some
appreciations
of
this
woman
which
i
was
too
upset
to
note
i
gasped
how
long
has
this
been
going
on
he
laughed
at
my
surprise
and
said
ever
since
i
went
down
to
stay
with
uncle
ambrose
at
dorney
after
i
got
my
fifteen
years
ago
i
was
still
staring
at
him
unable
to
believe
this
barefaced
admission
of
a
deception
carried
on
for
years
when
he
went
on
to
say
that
though
he
had
wired
to
her
and
she
had
wired
a
message
in
return
she
had
said
anything
about
coming
over
to
see
him
now
he
said
quite
coolly
i
know
old
allington
had
a
bad
season
oh
i
quite
well
up
in
the
innkeeping
business
these
days
and
i
think
it
may
quite
possibly
be
a
lack
of
funds
that
is
keeping
her
away
i
lost
my
somewhere
in
the
scrim
and
so
i
wonder
if
you
send
her
some
money
or
better
still
for
she
a
shy
country
thing
you
might
fetch
her
i
stared
chris
i
said
i
know
the
war
is
making
some
of
us
very
lax
and
i
can
only
ascribe
to
that
the
shamelessness
with
which
you
admit
the
existence
of
a
intrigue
but
when
it
comes
to
asking
me
to
go
over
to
england
and
fetch
the
woman
he
interrupted
me
with
a
sneer
that
we
parsons
are
inveterately
eighteenth
century
and
have
our
minds
perpetually
inflamed
by
visions
of
squires
sons
seducing
country
wenches
and
declared
that
he
meant
to
marry
this
margaret
allington
oh
indeed
i
said
and
may
i
ask
what
kitty
says
to
this
arrangement
who
the
devil
is
kitty
he
asked
blankly
kitty
is
your
wife
i
said
quietly
but
firmly
he
sat
up
and
shouted
i
have
got
a
wife
has
some
woman
been
turning
up
with
a
story
of
being
my
wife
because
it
the
damnedest
lie
i
determined
to
settle
the
matter
by
sharp
handling
chris
i
said
you
have
evidently
lost
your
memory
you
were
married
to
kitty
ellis
at
george
hanover
square
on
the
third
or
it
may
have
been
the
fourth
you
know
my
wretched
memory
for
dates
of
february
in
he
turned
very
pale
and
asked
what
year
this
was
i
told
him
he
fell
back
in
a
fainting
condition
the
nurse
came
and
said
i
had
done
it
all
right
this
time
so
she
at
least
seemed
to
have
known
that
he
required
a
rude
awakening
although
the
doctor
a
very
nice
man
winchester
and
new
told
me
he
had
known
nothing
of
chris
delusions
an
hour
later
i
was
called
back
into
the
room
chris
was
looking
at
himself
in
a
which
he
threw
on
the
floor
as
i
entered
you
are
right
he
said
i
not
but
he
said
he
felt
lonely
and
afraid
and
that
i
must
bring
margaret
allington
to
him
at
once
or
he
would
die
suddenly
he
stopped
raving
and
asked
is
father
all
right
i
prayed
for
guidance
and
answered
your
father
passed
away
twelve
years
ago
he
said
good
god
ca
you
say
he
and
he
turned
over
and
lay
with
his
back
to
me
i
have
never
before
seen
a
strong
man
weep
and
it
is
indeed
a
terrible
sight
he
moaned
a
lot
and
began
to
call
for
this
margaret
then
he
turned
over
again
and
said
now
tell
us
all
about
this
kitty
that
i
married
i
told
him
she
was
a
beautiful
little
woman
and
mentioned
that
she
had
a
charming
and
cultivated
soprano
voice
he
said
very
fractiously
i
do
like
little
women
and
i
hate
anybody
male
or
female
who
sings
o
god
i
do
like
this
kitty
take
her
away
and
then
he
began
to
rave
again
about
this
woman
he
said
that
he
was
consumed
with
desire
for
her
and
that
he
would
never
rest
until
he
once
more
held
her
in
his
arms
i
had
no
suspicion
that
chris
had
this
side
to
his
nature
and
it
was
almost
a
relief
when
he
fainted
again
i
have
not
seen
him
since
and
it
is
evening
but
i
have
had
a
long
talk
with
the
doctor
who
says
that
he
has
satisfied
himself
that
chris
is
suffering
from
a
loss
of
memory
extending
over
a
period
of
fifteen
years
he
says
that
though
of
course
it
will
be
an
occasion
of
great
trial
to
us
all
he
thinks
that
in
view
of
chris
expressed
longing
for
harrowweald
he
ought
to
be
taken
home
and
advises
me
to
make
all
arrangements
for
bringing
him
back
some
time
next
week
i
hope
i
shall
be
upheld
in
this
difficult
enterprise
in
the
meantime
i
leave
it
to
you
to
prepare
kitty
for
this
terrible
shock
i
could
have
wished
it
were
a
woman
of
a
different
type
who
was
to
see
my
poor
cousin
through
these
dark
days
but
convey
to
her
my
deepest
sympathy
indeed
i
never
realized
the
horror
of
warfare
until
i
saw
my
cousin
of
whose
probity
i
am
as
firmly
convinced
as
of
my
own
wantonly
repudiating
his
most
sacred
obligations
yours
ever
frank
over
my
shoulder
kitty
muttered
and
he
always
pretended
he
liked
my
singing
then
she
gripped
my
arm
and
shrieked
in
a
possessive
fury
bring
him
home
bring
him
home
so
a
week
later
they
brought
chris
home
from
that
day
the
house
was
pervaded
with
a
feeling
although
all
duties
arising
from
the
occasion
had
been
performed
one
could
settle
to
nothing
else
chris
was
expected
at
one
but
then
there
came
a
telegram
to
say
he
was
delayed
till
the
late
afternoon
so
kitty
whose
beauty
was
as
changed
in
grief
from
its
ordinary
seeming
as
a
rose
in
moonlight
is
different
from
a
rose
by
day
took
me
down
after
lunch
to
the
greenhouses
and
had
a
snappishly
competent
conversation
about
the
year
vegetables
with
pipe
the
gardener
then
kitty
went
into
the
and
filled
the
house
with
the
desolate
merriment
of
an
inattentively
played
pianola
while
i
sat
in
the
hall
and
wrote
letters
and
noticed
how
sad
has
sounded
ever
since
the
war
began
after
that
she
started
a
savage
raid
of
domestic
efficiency
and
made
the
housemaids
cry
because
the
brass
handles
of
the
were
not
bright
enough
and
because
there
was
only
instead
of
a
risk
of
breaking
a
leg
on
the
parquet
then
she
had
tea
and
hated
the
she
was
a
little
shrunk
thing
huddled
in
the
farthest
from
the
light
when
at
last
the
big
car
came
nosing
up
the
drive
through
the
dark
we
stood
up
through
the
thudding
of
the
engines
came
the
sound
of
chris
great
male
voice
which
always
had
in
it
a
note
like
the
baying
of
a
big
dog
thanks
i
can
manage
by
myself
i
heard
amazed
his
step
ring
strong
upon
the
stone
for
i
had
felt
his
absence
as
a
kind
of
death
from
which
he
would
emerge
ghostlike
impalpable
and
then
he
stood
in
the
doorway
the
gloom
blurring
his
outlines
like
fur
the
faint
clear
catching
the
fair
down
on
his
face
he
did
not
see
me
in
my
dark
dress
or
huddled
kitty
and
with
the
sleepy
smile
of
one
who
returns
to
a
dear
familiar
place
to
rest
he
walked
into
the
hall
and
laid
down
his
stick
and
his
khaki
cap
beside
the
candlestick
on
the
oak
table
with
both
hands
he
felt
the
old
wood
and
stood
humming
happily
through
his
teeth
i
cried
out
because
i
had
seen
that
his
hair
was
of
three
colors
now
brown
and
gold
and
silver
with
a
quick
turn
of
the
head
he
found
me
out
in
the
shadows
hullo
jenny
he
said
and
gripped
my
hands
o
chris
i
am
so
glad
i
stuttered
and
then
could
say
no
more
for
shame
that
i
was
instead
of
twenty
for
his
eyes
had
hardened
in
the
midst
of
his
welcome
as
though
he
had
trusted
that
i
at
least
would
have
been
no
party
to
this
conspiracy
to
deny
that
he
was
young
and
he
said
i
dropped
frank
in
town
my
temper
of
the
convalescent
type
he
might
as
well
have
said
i
dropped
frank
who
had
grown
old
like
you
chris
i
went
on
it
so
wonderful
to
have
you
safe
safe
he
repeated
he
sighed
very
deeply
and
continued
to
hold
my
hands
there
was
a
rustle
in
the
shadows
and
he
dropped
my
hands
the
face
that
looked
out
of
the
dimness
to
him
was
very
white
and
her
upper
lip
was
lifted
over
her
teeth
in
a
distressed
grimace
it
was
immediately
as
plain
as
though
he
had
shouted
it
that
this
sad
mask
meant
nothing
to
him
he
knew
not
because
memory
had
given
him
any
insight
into
her
heart
but
because
there
is
an
instinctive
kindliness
in
him
which
makes
him
wise
about
all
suffering
that
it
would
hurt
her
if
he
asked
if
this
was
his
wife
but
his
body
involuntarily
began
a
gesture
of
inquiry
before
he
realized
that
that
too
would
hurt
her
and
he
checked
it
so
through
a
silence
he
stood
before
her
slightly
bent
as
though
he
had
been
maimed
i
am
your
wife
there
was
a
weak
wailing
anger
behind
the
words
kitty
he
said
softly
and
kindly
he
looked
around
for
some
graciousness
to
make
the
scene
less
wounding
and
stooped
to
kiss
her
but
he
could
not
the
thought
of
another
woman
made
him
unable
to
breathe
sent
the
blood
running
under
his
skin
with
a
toss
like
a
child
saying
well
if
you
do
want
to
i
sure
i
would
for
the
world
kitty
withdrew
from
the
suspended
caress
he
watched
her
retreat
into
the
shadows
as
though
she
were
a
symbol
of
this
new
life
by
which
he
was
baffled
and
oppressed
until
the
darkness
outside
became
filled
with
the
sound
like
the
surf
which
we
always
hear
at
harrowweald
on
angry
evenings
and
his
eyes
became
distant
and
his
lips
smiled
up
here
in
this
old
place
how
one
hears
the
pines
she
cried
out
from
the
other
end
of
the
room
as
though
she
were
speaking
with
some
one
behind
a
shut
door
i
ordered
dinner
at
seven
i
thought
you
probably
have
missed
a
meal
or
two
or
would
want
to
go
to
bed
early
she
said
it
very
smartly
with
her
head
on
one
side
like
a
bird
as
if
she
was
pleading
that
he
would
find
her
very
clever
about
ordering
dinner
and
thinking
of
his
comfort
good
he
said
i
better
dress
now
had
i
he
looked
up
the
and
would
have
gone
up
had
i
not
held
him
back
for
the
little
room
in
the
south
wing
with
the
and
the
old
books
went
in
the
rebuilding
absorbed
by
the
magnificence
that
is
kitty
bedroom
oh
i
take
you
up
kitty
rang
out
efficiently
she
pulled
at
his
so
they
started
level
on
the
lowest
step
but
as
they
went
up
the
sense
of
his
separateness
beat
her
back
she
lifted
her
arms
as
though
she
struggled
through
a
fog
and
fell
behind
when
he
reached
the
top
she
was
standing
down
the
stairs
her
hands
clasped
under
her
chin
but
he
did
not
see
her
he
was
looking
along
the
corridor
and
saying
this
house
is
different
if
the
soul
has
to
stay
in
its
coffin
till
the
lead
is
struck
asunder
in
its
captivity
it
speaks
with
such
a
voice
she
braced
herself
with
a
gallant
laugh
how
you
forgotten
she
cried
and
ran
up
to
him
rattling
her
keys
and
looking
grave
with
housewifery
and
i
was
left
alone
with
the
dusk
and
the
familiar
things
the
dusk
flowed
in
wet
and
cool
from
the
garden
as
if
to
put
out
the
fire
of
confusion
lighted
on
our
hearthstone
and
the
furniture
very
visible
through
that
soft
evening
opacity
with
the
observant
brightness
of
old
wood
seemed
terribly
aware
strangeness
had
come
into
the
house
and
everything
was
appalled
by
it
even
time
for
the
moments
dragged
it
seemed
to
me
half
an
hour
later
that
i
had
been
standing
for
an
infinite
period
in
the
remembering
that
in
the
old
days
the
blinds
had
never
been
drawn
in
this
room
because
old
baldry
had
liked
to
see
the
night
gathering
like
a
pool
in
the
valley
while
the
day
lingered
as
a
white
streak
above
the
farthest
hills
and
perceiving
in
pain
that
the
heavy
blue
blinds
that
shroud
the
nine
windows
because
a
lost
zeppelin
sometimes
clanks
like
a
skeleton
across
the
sky
above
us
would
make
his
home
seem
even
more
like
prison
i
began
to
say
what
was
in
my
mind
to
kitty
when
she
came
in
but
she
moved
past
me
remote
in
preoccupation
and
i
was
silent
when
i
saw
that
she
was
dressed
in
all
respects
like
a
bride
the
gown
she
wore
on
her
ten
years
ago
had
been
cut
and
embroidered
as
this
white
satin
was
her
hair
had
been
coiled
low
on
her
neck
as
it
was
now
around
her
throat
were
her
pearls
and
her
longer
chain
of
diamonds
dropped
looking
cruelly
bright
to
her
white
small
breasts
because
she
held
some
needlework
to
her
bosom
i
saw
that
her
right
hand
was
stiff
with
rings
and
her
left
hand
bare
save
for
her
she
dropped
her
load
of
flannel
on
a
and
sat
down
spreading
out
her
skirts
in
an
by
the
fire
with
her
lower
lip
thrust
out
as
if
she
were
considering
a
menu
she
lowered
her
head
and
looked
down
on
herself
she
frowned
to
see
that
the
high
lights
on
the
satin
shone
scarlet
from
the
fire
that
her
flesh
glowed
like
a
rose
and
she
changed
her
seat
for
a
chair
beneath
the
farthest
there
were
green
curtains
close
by
and
now
the
lights
on
her
satin
gown
were
green
like
cleft
ice
she
looked
as
cold
as
moonlight
as
virginity
but
precious
the
falling
struck
her
hair
to
bright
pure
gold
so
she
waited
for
him
there
came
suddenly
a
thud
at
the
door
we
heard
chris
swear
and
stumble
to
his
feet
while
one
of
the
servants
spoke
helpfully
kitty
knitted
her
brows
for
she
hates
gracelessness
and
a
failure
of
physical
adjustment
is
the
worst
indignity
she
can
conceive
he
fallen
down
those
three
steps
from
the
hall
i
whispered
they
new
she
did
not
listen
because
she
was
controlling
her
face
into
harmony
with
the
appearance
of
serene
virginity
upon
which
his
eyes
would
fall
when
he
entered
the
room
his
fall
had
ruffled
him
and
made
him
look
very
large
and
red
and
he
breathed
hard
like
an
animal
pursued
into
a
strange
place
by
night
and
to
his
hot
consciousness
of
his
disorder
the
sight
of
kitty
her
face
and
hands
and
bosom
shining
like
the
snow
her
gown
enfolding
her
and
her
gold
hair
crowning
her
with
radiance
and
the
white
fire
of
jewels
giving
passion
to
the
spectacle
was
a
deep
refreshment
she
sat
still
for
a
time
so
that
he
might
feel
this
well
then
raised
her
ringed
hand
to
her
necklaces
it
seems
so
strange
that
you
should
not
remember
me
she
said
you
gave
me
all
these
he
answered
kindly
i
am
glad
i
did
that
you
look
very
beautiful
in
them
but
as
he
spoke
his
gaze
shifted
to
the
shadows
in
the
corners
of
the
room
and
the
blood
ran
hot
under
his
skin
he
was
thinking
of
another
woman
of
another
beauty
kitty
put
up
her
hands
as
if
to
defend
her
jewels
in
that
silence
dinner
was
announced
and
we
went
into
the
it
is
the
fashion
at
baldry
court
to
use
no
electric
light
save
when
there
is
work
to
be
done
or
a
great
company
to
be
entertained
and
to
eat
and
talk
by
the
mild
clarity
of
many
candles
that
night
it
was
a
kindly
fashion
for
we
sat
about
the
table
with
our
faces
veiled
in
shadow
and
seemed
to
listen
in
quiet
contentment
to
the
talk
of
our
man
who
had
come
back
to
us
yet
all
through
the
meal
i
was
near
to
weeping
because
whenever
he
thought
himself
unobserved
he
looked
at
the
things
that
were
familiar
to
him
dipping
his
head
he
would
glance
sidewise
at
the
old
oak
paneling
and
nearer
things
he
fingered
as
though
sight
were
not
intimate
enough
a
contact
his
hand
caressed
the
arm
of
his
chair
because
he
remembered
the
black
gleam
of
it
stole
out
and
touched
the
recollected
it
was
his
furtiveness
that
was
heartrending
it
was
as
though
he
were
an
outcast
and
we
who
loved
him
stout
policemen
was
baldry
court
so
sleek
a
place
that
the
unhappy
felt
offenders
there
then
we
had
all
been
living
wickedly
and
he
too
as
his
fingers
glided
here
and
there
he
talked
bravely
about
things
to
what
ponies
we
had
been
strapped
when
at
the
age
of
five
we
were
introduced
to
the
how
we
had
teased
to
be
allowed
to
keep
swans
in
the
pond
above
the
wood
and
how
the
yellow
bills
of
our
intended
pets
had
sent
us
shrieking
homeward
and
all
the
dear
life
that
makes
the
bland
english
secretly
adventurous
funny
thing
he
said
all
the
time
i
was
at
boulogne
i
wanted
to
see
a
kingfisher
that
blue
scudding
down
a
stream
or
a
heron
flight
round
a
willow
he
checked
himself
suddenly
his
head
fell
forward
on
his
chest
you
have
no
herons
here
of
course
he
said
drearily
and
fingered
the
arm
of
his
chair
again
then
he
raised
his
head
again
brisk
with
another
subject
do
they
still
have
trouble
with
foxes
at
steppy
end
kitty
shook
her
head
i
do
know
griffiths
will
know
chris
said
cheerily
and
swung
round
on
his
seat
to
ask
the
butler
and
found
him
osseous
where
griffiths
was
rotund
dark
where
griffiths
had
been
merrily
mottled
strange
where
griffiths
had
been
a
part
of
home
a
condition
of
life
he
sat
back
in
his
chair
as
though
his
heart
had
stopped
when
the
butler
who
is
not
griffiths
had
left
the
room
he
spoke
gruffly
stupid
of
me
i
know
but
where
is
griffiths
dead
seven
years
ago
said
kitty
her
eyes
on
her
plate
he
sighed
deeply
in
a
shuddering
horror
i
sorry
he
was
a
good
man
i
cleared
my
throat
there
are
new
people
here
chris
but
they
love
you
as
the
old
ones
did
he
forced
himself
to
smile
at
us
both
to
a
gay
response
as
if
i
did
know
that
but
he
did
not
know
it
even
to
me
he
would
give
no
trust
because
it
was
jenny
the
girl
who
had
been
his
friend
and
not
jenny
the
woman
all
the
inhabitants
at
this
new
tract
of
time
were
his
enemies
all
its
circumstances
his
there
was
suspicion
in
the
gesture
with
which
when
we
were
back
in
the
he
picked
up
the
flannel
from
the
whose
is
this
he
said
curiously
his
mother
had
been
a
woman
not
apt
with
her
needle
clothes
for
one
of
the
cottages
answered
kitty
breathlessly
we
we
a
lot
of
responsibilities
you
and
i
with
all
of
the
land
you
bought
there
are
ever
so
many
people
to
look
after
he
moved
his
shoulders
uneasily
as
if
under
a
yoke
and
after
he
had
drunk
his
coffee
pulled
up
one
of
the
blinds
and
went
out
to
pace
the
flagged
walk
under
the
windows
kitty
huddled
carelessly
by
the
fire
her
hands
over
her
face
unheeding
by
its
red
glow
she
looked
not
so
virginal
and
so
i
think
she
was
too
distracted
even
to
plan
i
went
to
the
piano
through
this
evening
of
sentences
cut
short
because
their
completed
meaning
was
always
sorrow
of
normal
life
dissolved
to
tears
the
chords
of
beethoven
sounded
serenely
so
you
like
jenny
said
kitty
suddenly
to
play
beethoven
when
the
war
that
caused
all
this
i
could
have
told
that
you
would
have
chosen
to
play
german
music
this
night
of
all
nights
so
i
began
a
saraband
by
purcell
a
jolly
thing
that
makes
one
see
a
plump
sound
woman
dancing
on
a
sanded
floor
in
some
old
inn
with
casks
of
good
ale
all
about
her
and
a
world
of
sunshine
and
may
lanes
without
as
i
played
i
wondered
if
things
like
this
happened
when
purcell
wrote
such
music
empty
of
everything
except
laughter
and
simple
greeds
and
satisfactions
and
at
worst
the
wail
of
unrequited
love
why
had
modern
life
brought
forth
these
horrors
which
made
the
old
tragedies
seem
no
more
than
and
the
sky
also
is
different
behind
chris
head
as
he
halted
at
the
open
window
a
turned
all
ways
in
the
night
like
a
sword
brandished
among
the
stars
kitty
yes
chris
she
was
sweet
and
obedient
and
alert
i
know
my
conduct
must
seem
to
you
perversely
insulting
behind
him
the
wheeled
while
he
gripped
the
sides
of
the
window
but
if
i
do
not
see
margaret
allington
i
shall
die
she
raised
her
hands
to
her
jewels
and
pressed
the
cool
globes
of
her
pearls
into
her
flesh
she
lives
near
here
she
said
easily
i
will
send
the
car
down
for
her
you
shall
see
as
much
of
her
as
you
like
his
arms
fell
to
his
sides
thank
you
he
muttered
you
all
being
so
kind
he
disengaged
himself
into
the
darkness
i
was
amazed
at
kitty
beautiful
act
and
more
amazed
to
find
that
it
had
made
her
face
ugly
her
eyes
snapped
as
they
met
mine
that
dowd
she
said
keeping
her
voice
low
so
that
he
might
not
hear
it
as
he
passed
to
and
fro
before
the
window
that
dowd
this
sudden
abandonment
of
beauty
and
amiability
meant
so
much
in
our
kitty
whose
law
of
life
is
grace
that
i
went
over
and
kissed
her
dear
you
taking
things
all
the
wrong
way
i
said
chris
is
ill
he
well
enough
to
remember
her
all
right
she
replied
unanswerably
her
silver
shoe
tapped
the
floor
she
pinched
her
lips
for
some
moments
after
all
i
suppose
i
can
sit
down
to
it
other
women
do
teddy
rex
keeps
a
gaiety
girl
and
rex
has
to
grin
and
bear
it
she
shrugged
in
answer
to
my
silence
what
else
is
it
do
you
think
it
means
that
chris
is
a
man
like
other
men
but
i
did
think
that
bad
women
were
pretty
i
suppose
he
had
so
much
to
do
with
pretty
ones
that
a
plain
one
a
change
kitty
kitty
how
can
you
but
her
little
pink
mouth
went
on
manufacturing
malice
this
is
all
a
blind
she
said
at
the
end
of
an
unpardonable
sentence
he
pretending
i
who
had
felt
his
agony
all
the
evening
like
a
wound
in
my
own
body
was
past
speech
then
and
i
did
not
care
what
i
did
to
stop
her
i
gripped
her
small
shoulders
with
my
large
hands
and
shook
her
till
her
jewels
rattled
and
she
scratched
my
fingers
and
gasped
for
breath
but
i
did
not
mind
so
long
as
she
was
silent
chris
spoke
from
the
darkness
jenny
i
let
her
go
he
came
in
and
stood
over
us
running
his
hand
through
his
hair
unhappily
let
all
be
decent
to
each
other
he
said
heavily
it
all
such
a
muddle
and
it
so
rotten
for
all
of
us
kitty
shook
herself
neat
and
stood
up
why
do
you
say
you
must
be
rude
to
visitors
it
how
you
feel
i
know
she
gathered
up
her
needlework
i
going
to
bed
it
been
a
horrid
night
she
spoke
so
pathetically
like
a
child
who
has
enjoyed
a
party
as
much
as
it
had
thought
it
would
that
both
of
us
felt
a
stir
of
tenderness
toward
her
as
she
left
the
room
we
smiled
sadly
at
each
other
as
we
sat
down
by
the
fire
and
i
perceived
that
perhaps
because
i
was
flushed
and
looked
younger
he
felt
more
intimate
with
me
than
he
had
yet
done
since
his
return
indeed
in
the
warm
friendly
silence
that
followed
he
was
like
a
patient
when
tiring
visitors
have
gone
and
he
is
left
alone
with
his
trusted
nurse
smiled
under
drooped
lids
and
then
paid
me
the
high
compliment
of
disregard
his
limbs
relaxed
he
sank
back
into
his
chair
i
watched
him
vigilantly
and
was
ready
at
that
moment
when
thought
intruded
into
his
drowsings
and
his
face
began
to
twitch
i
asked
you
ca
remember
her
at
all
oh
yes
he
said
without
raising
his
eyelids
in
a
sense
i
know
how
she
bows
when
you
meet
her
in
the
street
how
she
dresses
when
she
goes
to
church
i
know
her
as
one
knows
a
woman
staying
in
the
same
hotel
just
like
that
it
a
pity
you
ca
remember
kitty
all
that
a
wife
should
be
been
to
you
he
sat
forward
warming
his
palms
at
the
blaze
and
hunching
his
shoulders
as
though
there
were
a
draft
his
silence
compelled
me
to
look
at
him
and
i
found
his
eyes
cold
and
incredulous
and
frightened
on
me
jenny
is
this
true
that
kitty
been
a
good
wife
that
kitty
is
my
wife
that
i
am
old
that
he
waved
a
hand
at
the
altered
room
all
this
it
is
all
true
she
is
your
wife
and
this
place
is
changed
and
better
and
jollier
in
all
sorts
of
ways
believe
me
and
fifteen
years
have
passed
why
chris
ca
you
see
that
i
have
grown
old
my
vanity
could
hardly
endure
his
slow
stare
but
i
kept
my
fingers
clasped
on
my
lap
you
see
he
turned
away
with
an
assenting
mutter
but
i
saw
that
deep
down
in
him
not
to
be
moved
by
any
material
proof
his
spirit
was
incredulous
tell
me
what
seems
real
to
you
i
begged
chris
be
a
pal
i
never
tell
he
said
his
elbows
were
on
his
knees
and
his
hands
stroked
his
thick
tarnished
hair
i
could
not
see
his
face
but
i
knew
that
his
skin
was
red
and
that
his
gray
eyes
were
wet
and
bright
then
suddenly
he
lifted
his
chin
and
laughed
like
a
happy
swimmer
breaking
through
a
wave
that
has
swept
him
far
inshore
he
glowed
with
a
radiance
that
illuminated
the
moment
till
my
blood
tingled
and
i
began
to
rub
my
hands
together
and
laugh
too
why
monkey
island
real
but
you
do
know
old
monkey
let
me
tell
you
chapter
iii
chris
told
the
story
lingeringly
in
loving
detail
from
uncle
gates
it
seems
one
took
the
path
across
the
meadow
where
cows
are
put
to
graze
passed
through
the
second
stile
the
one
between
the
two
big
alders
into
a
long
straight
road
that
ran
across
the
flat
lands
to
bray
after
a
mile
or
so
there
branched
from
it
a
private
road
that
followed
a
line
of
noble
poplars
down
to
the
ferry
between
two
of
them
he
described
it
meticulously
as
though
it
were
of
immense
significance
there
stood
a
white
hawthorn
in
front
were
the
glassy
waters
of
an
unvisited
and
beyond
them
a
bright
lawn
set
with
many
and
a
few
great
chestnuts
well
lighted
with
their
candles
and
to
the
left
of
that
a
low
white
house
with
a
green
dome
rising
in
its
middle
and
a
veranda
with
a
roof
of
hammered
iron
that
had
gone
with
age
and
the
thames
weather
this
was
the
monkey
island
inn
the
third
duke
of
marlborough
had
built
it
for
a
folly
and
perching
there
with
nothing
but
a
line
of
and
a
fringe
of
lawn
between
it
and
the
fast
full
shining
thames
it
had
an
grace
and
silliness
well
one
sounded
the
bell
that
hung
on
a
post
and
presently
margaret
in
a
white
dress
would
come
out
of
the
porch
and
would
walk
to
the
stone
steps
down
to
the
river
invariably
as
she
passed
the
that
overhung
the
path
she
would
pick
a
leaf
crush
it
and
sniff
the
sweet
scent
and
as
she
came
near
the
steps
she
would
shade
her
eyes
and
peer
across
the
water
she
is
a
little
you
ca
imagine
how
sweet
it
makes
her
look
chris
explained
i
did
not
say
that
i
had
seen
her
for
indeed
this
margaret
i
had
never
seen
a
sudden
serene
gravity
would
show
that
she
had
seen
one
and
she
would
get
into
the
punt
that
was
used
as
a
ferry
and
bring
it
over
very
slowly
with
rather
stiff
movements
of
her
long
arms
to
exactly
the
right
place
when
she
had
got
the
punt
up
on
the
gravel
her
serious
brow
would
relax
and
she
would
smile
at
one
and
shake
hands
and
say
something
friendly
like
father
thought
you
be
over
this
afternoon
it
being
so
fine
so
he
saved
some
duck
eggs
for
tea
and
then
one
took
the
pole
from
her
and
brought
her
back
to
the
island
though
probably
one
did
not
mount
the
steps
to
the
lawn
for
a
long
time
it
was
so
good
to
sit
in
the
punt
by
the
while
margaret
dabbled
her
hands
in
the
black
waters
and
forgot
her
shyness
as
one
talked
she
such
good
company
she
got
an
accurate
mind
that
would
have
made
her
a
good
engineer
but
when
she
picks
up
facts
she
kind
of
gives
them
a
motherly
hug
she
charity
and
love
itself
again
i
did
not
say
that
i
had
seen
her
if
people
drifted
in
to
tea
one
had
to
talk
to
her
while
she
cut
the
bread
and
butter
and
the
sandwiches
in
the
kitchen
but
in
this
year
of
floods
few
visitors
cared
to
try
the
hard
rowing
below
bray
lock
illustration
she
would
get
into
the
punt
that
was
used
as
a
ferry
and
bring
it
over
very
slowly
so
usually
one
sat
down
there
in
the
boat
talking
with
a
sense
of
leisure
as
though
one
had
all
the
rest
of
one
life
in
which
to
carry
on
this
conversation
and
noting
how
the
reflected
ripple
of
the
water
made
a
bright
vibrant
mark
upon
her
throat
and
other
effects
of
the
scene
upon
her
beauty
until
the
afternoon
grew
drowsy
and
she
said
father
will
be
wanting
his
tea
and
they
would
go
up
and
find
old
allington
in
white
ducks
standing
in
the
fringe
of
long
grasses
and
on
the
other
edge
of
the
island
looking
to
his
poultry
or
his
rabbits
he
was
a
little
man
with
a
tuft
of
hair
rising
from
the
middle
of
his
forehead
like
a
clown
curl
who
shook
hands
hard
and
explained
very
soon
that
he
was
a
rough
diamond
then
they
all
had
tea
under
the
where
the
canary
cage
was
hanging
and
the
ducks
eggs
would
be
brought
out
and
allington
would
talk
much
gossip
how
the
at
teddington
had
had
his
back
broken
by
a
swan
mad
as
swans
are
in
may
how
they
would
lose
their
license
at
the
dovetail
arms
if
they
were
not
careful
and
how
the
man
who
kept
the
inn
by
surly
hall
was
like
to
die
because
after
he
had
been
cursing
his
daughter
for
two
days
for
having
run
away
with
a
soldier
from
windsor
barracks
he
had
suddenly
seen
her
white
face
in
a
clump
of
rushes
in
the
river
just
under
the
hole
in
the
garden
fence
margaret
would
sit
quiet
at
the
world
ways
and
shy
because
of
chris
so
they
would
sit
on
that
bright
lawn
until
the
day
was
dyed
with
evening
blue
and
allington
was
more
and
more
often
obliged
to
leap
into
the
punt
to
chase
his
ducks
which
had
started
on
a
trip
to
bray
lock
or
to
crawl
into
the
undergrowth
after
rabbits
similarly
demoralized
by
the
dusk
then
chris
would
say
he
had
to
go
and
they
would
stand
in
a
communing
silence
while
the
hearty
voice
of
allington
shouted
from
midstream
or
under
the
a
disregarded
invitation
to
stay
and
have
a
bite
of
supper
in
the
liquefaction
of
colors
which
happens
on
a
summer
evening
when
the
green
grass
seemed
like
a
precious
fluid
poured
out
on
the
earth
and
dripping
over
to
the
river
and
the
chestnut
candles
were
no
longer
proud
flowers
but
just
wet
white
lights
in
the
humid
mass
of
the
tree
when
the
brown
earth
seemed
just
a
little
denser
than
the
water
margaret
also
participated
chris
explained
this
part
of
his
story
stumblingly
but
i
too
have
watched
people
i
loved
in
the
dusk
and
i
know
what
he
meant
as
she
sat
in
the
punt
while
he
ferried
himself
across
it
was
no
longer
visible
that
her
fair
hair
curled
differently
and
that
its
rather
wandering
parting
was
a
little
on
one
side
that
her
straight
brows
which
were
a
little
darker
than
her
hair
were
nearly
always
contracted
in
a
frown
of
conscientious
speculation
that
her
mouth
and
chin
were
noble
yet
as
delicate
as
flowers
that
her
shoulders
were
slightly
hunched
because
her
young
body
like
a
found
it
difficult
to
manage
its
own
tallness
she
was
then
just
a
girl
in
white
who
lifted
a
white
face
or
drooped
a
head
then
she
was
nearer
to
him
than
at
any
other
time
that
he
loved
her
in
this
twilight
which
obscured
all
the
physical
details
which
he
adored
seemed
to
him
a
guarantee
that
theirs
was
a
changeless
love
which
would
persist
if
she
were
old
or
maimed
or
disfigured
he
stood
beside
the
crazy
post
where
the
bell
hung
and
watched
the
white
figure
take
the
punt
over
the
black
waters
mount
the
gray
steps
and
assume
some
of
their
grayness
become
a
green
shade
in
the
green
darkness
of
the
lawn
and
he
exulted
in
that
guarantee
how
long
this
went
on
he
had
forgotten
but
it
continued
for
some
time
before
there
came
the
end
of
his
life
the
last
day
he
could
remember
i
was
barred
out
of
that
day
his
lips
told
me
of
its
physical
appearances
while
from
his
wet
bright
eyes
and
his
flushed
skin
his
beautiful
signs
of
a
noble
excitement
i
tried
to
derive
the
real
story
it
seemed
that
the
day
when
he
bicycled
over
to
monkey
island
happy
because
uncle
ambrose
had
gone
up
to
town
and
he
could
stay
to
supper
with
the
allingtons
was
the
most
glorious
day
the
year
had
yet
brought
the
whole
world
seemed
melting
into
light
floated
very
high
like
lumps
of
white
light
against
a
deep
glowing
sky
and
dropped
dazzling
reflections
on
the
beaming
thames
the
trees
moved
not
like
timber
shocked
by
wind
but
floatingly
like
weeds
at
the
bottom
of
a
well
of
sunshine
when
margaret
came
out
of
the
porch
and
paused
as
she
always
did
to
crush
and
smell
the
and
shade
her
eyes
with
her
hand
her
white
dress
shone
like
silver
illustration
he
lay
there
in
the
confiding
relaxation
of
a
child
she
brought
the
punt
across
and
said
very
primly
dad
will
be
disappointed
he
gone
up
to
town
on
business
and
answered
gravely
that
is
very
kind
of
you
when
he
took
the
from
her
and
said
laughingly
never
mind
i
come
and
see
you
all
the
same
i
could
see
them
as
chris
spoke
so
young
and
pale
and
solemn
with
the
intense
light
spilling
all
around
them
that
afternoon
they
did
not
sit
in
the
punt
by
the
but
wandered
about
the
island
and
played
with
the
rabbits
and
looked
at
the
ducks
and
were
inordinately
silent
for
a
long
time
they
stood
in
the
fringe
of
rough
grass
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
and
margaret
breathed
contentedly
that
the
thames
was
so
beautiful
past
the
spit
of
sand
at
the
far
end
of
the
island
where
a
great
swan
swanked
to
the
empty
reach
that
it
would
protect
its
mate
against
all
comers
the
river
opened
to
a
silver
breadth
between
flat
meadows
stretching
back
to
far
rows
of
black
poplars
until
it
wound
away
to
windsor
behind
a
line
of
high
trees
whose
heads
were
bronze
with
unopened
buds
and
whose
flanks
were
hidden
by
a
head
of
and
crimson
and
white
hawthorn
chris
said
he
would
take
her
down
to
dorney
lock
in
the
skiff
and
she
got
in
very
silently
and
obediently
but
as
soon
as
they
were
out
in
midstream
she
developed
a
sense
of
duty
and
said
she
could
not
leave
the
inn
with
just
that
boy
to
look
after
it
and
then
she
went
into
the
kitchen
and
sucking
in
her
lower
lip
for
shyness
very
conscientiously
cut
piles
of
bread
and
butter
in
case
some
visitors
came
to
tea
just
when
chris
was
convincing
her
of
the
impossibility
of
any
visitors
arriving
they
came
a
fat
woman
in
a
luscious
pink
blouse
and
an
old
chap
who
had
been
rowing
in
a
tweed
waistcoat
chris
went
out
though
margaret
laughed
and
trembled
and
begged
him
not
to
and
waited
on
them
it
should
have
been
a
great
lark
but
suddenly
he
hated
them
and
when
they
offered
him
a
tip
for
pushing
the
boat
off
he
snarled
absurdly
and
ran
back
miraculously
relieved
to
the
still
margaret
would
not
leave
the
island
supposing
she
said
that
learoyd
comes
for
his
ale
but
she
consented
to
walk
with
him
to
the
wild
part
of
the
island
where
poplars
and
alders
and
willows
grew
round
a
clearing
in
which
white
and
purple
figwort
and
here
and
there
a
last
ailing
consequence
of
one
of
allington
least
successful
enterprises
fought
down
to
the
fringe
of
iris
on
the
river
lip
in
this
gentle
jungle
was
a
rustic
seat
relic
of
a
reckless
aspiration
on
the
part
of
allington
to
make
this
a
and
on
it
they
sat
until
a
pale
moon
appeared
above
the
green
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
not
six
yet
he
said
taking
out
his
watch
not
six
yet
she
repeated
words
seemed
to
bear
more
significance
than
they
had
ever
borne
before
then
a
heron
flapped
gigantic
in
front
of
the
moon
and
swung
in
wide
circles
round
the
before
them
oh
look
she
cried
he
seized
the
hand
she
flung
upward
and
gathered
her
into
his
arms
they
were
so
for
long
while
the
great
bird
wings
beat
about
them
afterward
she
pulled
at
his
hand
she
wanted
to
go
back
across
the
lawn
and
walk
round
the
inn
which
looked
mournful
as
unlit
houses
do
by
dusk
they
passed
beside
the
stucco
barrier
of
the
veranda
and
stood
on
the
lawn
that
shelved
high
over
the
stream
at
the
island
end
regarding
the
river
which
was
now
something
more
wonderful
than
water
because
it
had
taken
to
its
bosom
the
rose
and
amber
glories
of
the
sunset
smoldering
behind
the
elms
and
bray
birds
sat
on
the
telegraph
wires
that
spanned
the
river
as
the
black
notes
sit
on
a
staff
of
music
then
she
went
to
the
window
of
the
parlor
and
rested
her
cheek
against
the
glass
looking
in
the
little
room
was
sad
with
twilight
and
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
margaret
on
the
table
and
the
enlarged
photograph
of
margaret
mother
over
the
and
the
views
of
tintern
abbey
framed
in
red
plush
and
on
the
floor
the
marigold
pattern
making
itself
felt
through
the
dusk
allington
carpet
slippers
think
of
me
sitting
in
there
she
whispered
not
knowing
you
loved
me
then
they
went
into
the
bar
and
drank
milk
while
she
walked
about
fingering
familiar
things
with
an
absurd
expression
of
exaltation
as
though
that
day
she
was
fond
of
everything
even
the
handles
of
the
when
there
had
descended
on
them
a
night
as
brilliant
as
the
day
he
drew
her
out
into
the
darkness
which
was
sweet
with
the
scent
of
and
they
went
across
the
lawn
bending
beneath
the
not
to
the
wild
part
of
the
island
but
to
a
circle
of
smooth
turf
divided
from
it
by
a
railing
of
wrought
iron
on
this
stood
a
small
greek
temple
looking
very
lovely
in
the
moonlight
he
had
never
brought
margaret
here
before
because
allington
had
once
told
him
spatulate
forefinger
at
his
nose
that
it
had
been
built
for
the
dook
for
his
excesses
and
it
was
in
the
quality
of
his
love
for
her
that
he
could
not
bear
to
think
of
her
in
association
with
anything
base
but
there
was
nothing
anywhere
but
beauty
he
lifted
her
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
within
the
columns
and
made
her
stand
in
a
niche
above
the
altar
a
strong
stream
of
moonlight
rushed
upon
her
there
by
its
light
he
could
not
tell
if
her
hair
was
white
as
silver
or
yellow
as
gold
and
again
he
was
filled
with
exaltation
because
he
knew
that
it
would
not
have
mattered
if
it
had
been
white
his
love
was
changeless
lifting
her
down
from
the
niche
he
told
her
so
and
as
he
spoke
her
warm
body
melted
to
nothingness
in
his
arms
the
columns
that
had
stood
so
hard
and
black
against
the
quivering
tide
of
moonlight
and
starlight
seemed
to
totter
and
dissolve
he
was
lying
in
a
hateful
world
where
entanglements
showed
impish
knots
against
a
livid
sky
full
of
blooming
noise
and
splashes
of
fire
and
wails
for
water
and
his
back
was
hurting
intolerably
chris
fell
to
blowing
out
the
candles
and
i
perhaps
because
the
egotistical
part
of
me
was
looking
for
something
to
say
that
would
make
him
feel
me
devoted
and
intimate
could
not
speak
suddenly
he
desisted
stared
at
a
and
said
if
you
had
seen
the
way
she
rested
her
cheek
against
the
glass
and
looked
into
the
little
room
you
understand
that
i
ca
say
kitty
my
wife
and
margaret
somehow
just
nothing
at
all
of
course
you
ca
i
murmured
sympathetically
we
gripped
hands
and
he
brought
down
on
our
conversation
the
finality
of
darkness
chapter
iv
next
morning
it
appeared
that
the
chauffeur
had
taken
the
car
up
to
town
to
get
a
part
replaced
and
margaret
could
not
be
brought
from
wealdstone
till
the
afternoon
it
fell
to
me
to
fetch
her
at
least
kitty
had
said
i
might
be
spared
that
humiliation
before
i
started
i
went
to
the
pond
on
the
hill
edge
it
is
a
place
where
autumn
lives
for
half
the
year
for
even
when
the
spring
lights
tongues
of
green
fire
in
the
undergrowth
and
the
valley
shows
sunlit
between
the
here
the
pond
is
fringed
with
yellow
bracken
and
tinted
bramble
and
the
water
flows
amber
over
last
winter
leaves
through
this
brown
gloom
darkened
now
by
a
surly
sky
chris
was
taking
the
skiff
standing
in
the
stern
and
using
his
oar
like
a
gondolier
he
had
come
down
here
soon
after
breakfast
driven
from
the
house
by
the
strangeness
of
all
but
the
outer
walls
and
discontented
with
the
grounds
because
everything
but
this
wet
intractable
spot
bore
the
marks
of
kitty
genius
after
lunch
there
had
been
another
attempt
to
settle
down
but
with
a
grim
glare
at
a
knot
of
late
christmas
roses
bright
in
a
copse
that
fifteen
years
ago
had
been
dark
he
went
back
to
the
and
this
play
with
the
skiff
it
was
a
sport
and
it
was
dreadful
to
see
him
turn
a
face
as
he
brought
the
boat
inshore
i
just
going
down
to
fetch
margaret
i
said
he
thanked
me
for
it
but
chris
i
must
tell
you
i
seen
margaret
she
came
up
here
so
kind
and
sweet
to
tell
us
you
were
wounded
she
the
greatest
dear
in
the
world
but
she
not
as
you
think
of
her
she
old
chris
she
is
beautiful
any
longer
she
drearily
married
she
seamed
and
scored
and
ravaged
by
squalid
circumstances
you
ca
love
her
when
you
see
her
did
i
tell
you
last
night
he
said
that
that
does
matter
he
dipped
his
oar
to
a
stroke
that
sent
him
away
from
me
bring
her
soon
i
shall
wait
for
her
down
here
wealdstone
is
not
in
its
way
a
bad
place
it
lies
in
the
lap
of
open
country
and
at
the
end
of
every
street
rise
the
green
hills
of
harrow
and
the
spires
of
harrow
school
but
all
the
streets
are
long
and
red
and
freely
articulated
with
railway
arches
and
factories
spoil
the
skyline
with
red
angular
chimneys
and
in
front
of
the
shops
stood
little
women
with
backs
ridged
by
cheap
stays
who
tapped
their
upper
lips
with
their
forefingers
and
made
other
feeble
doubtful
gestures
as
though
they
wanted
to
buy
something
and
knew
that
if
they
did
they
would
have
to
starve
some
other
appetite
when
we
asked
them
the
way
they
turned
to
us
faces
sour
with
thrift
it
was
a
town
of
people
who
could
not
do
as
they
liked
and
here
margaret
lived
in
a
long
road
of
boxes
flecked
here
and
there
with
the
pink
blur
of
which
debouched
in
a
flat
field
where
green
grass
rose
up
rank
through
clay
mold
blackened
by
from
the
railway
mariposa
which
was
the
last
house
in
the
road
did
not
even
have
an
in
the
front
garden
which
seemed
to
be
imperfectly
reclaimed
from
the
greasy
field
yellow
crocus
and
some
sodden
squills
just
winked
and
the
back
where
a
man
was
handling
a
spade
without
mastery
presented
the
austere
appearance
of
an
allotment
and
not
only
did
margaret
live
in
this
place
she
also
belonged
to
it
when
she
opened
the
door
she
gazed
at
me
with
watering
eyes
and
in
perplexity
stroked
her
disordered
hair
with
a
floury
hand
her
face
was
sallow
with
heat
and
beads
of
perspiration
glittered
in
the
deep
dragging
line
between
her
nostrils
and
the
corners
of
her
mouth
she
said
he
home
i
nodded
she
pulled
me
inside
and
slammed
the
door
is
he
well
she
asked
quite
i
answered
her
tense
stare
relaxed
she
rubbed
her
hands
on
her
overall
and
said
you
excuse
me
it
the
girl
day
out
if
you
step
into
the
parlor
so
in
her
parlor
i
sat
and
told
her
how
it
was
with
chris
and
how
greatly
he
desired
to
see
her
and
as
i
spoke
of
his
longing
i
turned
my
eyes
away
from
her
because
she
was
sitting
on
a
sofa
upholstered
in
velveteen
of
a
sickish
green
which
was
so
low
that
her
knees
stuck
up
in
front
of
her
and
she
had
to
clasp
them
with
her
seamed
floury
hands
i
could
see
that
the
skin
of
her
face
was
damp
and
my
voice
failed
me
as
i
looked
round
the
room
because
i
saw
just
what
margaret
had
seen
that
evening
fifteen
years
ago
when
she
had
laid
her
cheek
to
the
parlor
window
at
monkey
island
there
was
the
enlarged
photograph
of
margaret
mother
over
the
mantelpiece
on
the
walls
were
the
views
of
tintern
abbey
framed
in
red
plush
between
the
rickety
legs
of
the
china
cupboard
was
the
and
tucked
into
the
corner
between
my
chair
and
the
fender
were
a
pair
of
carpet
slippers
all
her
life
long
margaret
who
in
her
time
had
partaken
of
the
supreme
dignity
of
a
requited
love
had
lived
with
men
who
wore
carpet
slippers
in
the
house
i
turned
my
eyes
away
again
and
this
time
looked
down
the
garden
at
the
figure
that
was
not
so
much
digging
as
exhibiting
his
incapacity
to
deal
with
a
spade
he
was
sneezing
very
frequently
and
his
sneezes
made
the
unbuckled
straps
at
the
back
of
his
waistcoat
wag
violently
i
supposed
him
to
be
william
grey
i
had
finished
the
statement
of
our
sad
case
and
i
saw
that
though
she
had
not
moved
clasping
her
knees
in
a
set
hideous
attitude
the
tears
were
rolling
down
her
cheeks
oh
do
oh
do
i
exclaimed
standing
up
her
immobility
touched
the
heart
he
not
so
bad
he
get
quite
well
i
know
i
know
she
said
miserably
i
do
believe
that
anything
bad
could
be
allowed
to
happen
to
chris
for
long
and
i
sure
she
said
kindly
you
looking
after
him
beautifully
but
when
a
thing
you
had
thought
had
ended
fifteen
years
ago
starts
all
over
again
and
very
tired
she
drew
a
hand
across
her
tears
her
damp
skin
her
rough
bagging
overall
i
hot
i
been
baking
you
ca
get
a
girl
nowadays
that
understands
the
baking
her
gaze
became
remote
and
tender
and
she
said
in
a
manner
that
was
at
once
argumentative
and
narrative
as
though
she
were
telling
the
whole
story
to
a
neighbor
over
the
garden
wall
i
suppose
i
ought
to
say
that
he
is
right
in
his
head
and
that
i
married
so
we
better
not
meet
but
oh
she
cried
and
i
felt
as
though
after
much
fumbling
with
damp
matches
and
many
doubts
as
to
whether
there
was
any
oil
in
the
wick
i
had
lit
the
lamp
at
last
i
want
to
see
him
so
it
wrong
i
know
it
wrong
but
i
am
so
glad
chris
wants
to
see
me
too
you
do
him
good
i
found
myself
raising
my
voice
to
the
pitch
she
had
suddenly
attained
as
though
to
keep
her
at
it
come
now
she
dipped
suddenly
to
compassion
but
the
young
lady
she
asked
timidly
she
was
upset
the
last
time
i
often
wondered
if
i
did
right
in
going
even
if
chris
has
forgotten
he
want
to
do
what
right
he
could
bear
to
hurt
her
that
true
i
said
you
do
know
our
chris
he
watches
her
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
even
when
he
feeling
at
his
worst
to
see
she
wincing
but
she
sent
me
here
oh
cried
margaret
glowing
she
must
have
a
lovely
nature
i
lost
suddenly
the
thread
of
the
conversation
i
could
not
talk
about
kitty
she
appeared
to
me
at
that
moment
a
faceless
figure
with
flounces
just
as
most
of
the
servants
at
baldry
court
appear
to
me
as
faceless
figures
with
caps
and
aprons
there
were
only
two
real
people
in
the
world
chris
and
this
woman
whose
personality
was
sounding
through
her
squalor
like
a
beautiful
voice
singing
in
a
darkened
room
and
i
was
absorbed
in
a
mental
vision
of
them
you
know
how
the
saints
and
the
prophets
are
depicted
in
the
steel
engravings
in
old
bibles
so
they
were
standing
in
flowing
white
robes
on
rocks
against
a
sky
a
strong
light
beating
on
their
eyes
upturned
in
ecstasy
and
their
hand
outstretched
to
receive
the
spiritual
blessing
of
which
the
fierce
rays
were
an
emanation
into
that
rapt
silence
i
desired
to
break
and
i
whispered
irrelevantly
oh
nothing
nothing
is
too
good
for
chris
while
i
said
to
myself
if
she
really
were
like
that
solemn
and
beatified
and
my
eyes
returned
to
look
despairingly
on
her
ugliness
but
she
really
was
like
that
she
had
responded
to
my
irrelevant
murmur
of
adoration
by
just
such
a
solemn
and
beatified
appearance
as
i
had
imagined
her
grave
eyes
were
upturned
her
worn
hands
lay
palm
upward
on
her
knees
as
though
to
receive
the
love
of
which
her
radiance
was
an
emanation
and
then
at
a
sound
in
the
kitchen
she
snatched
my
exaltation
from
me
by
suddenly
turning
dull
i
think
that
grey
come
in
from
his
gardening
you
excuse
me
through
the
open
door
i
heard
a
voice
saying
in
a
way
which
suggested
that
its
production
involved
much
agitation
of
a
prominent
adam
apple
well
dear
seeing
you
had
a
friend
i
thought
i
better
slip
up
and
change
my
gardening
trousers
i
do
not
know
what
she
said
to
him
but
her
voice
was
soft
and
comforting
and
occasionally
girlish
and
interrupted
by
laughter
and
i
perceived
from
its
sound
that
with
characteristic
gravity
she
had
accepted
it
as
her
mission
to
keep
loveliness
and
excitement
alive
in
his
life
an
old
friend
of
mine
has
been
wounded
was
the
only
phrase
i
heard
but
when
she
drew
him
out
into
the
garden
under
the
window
she
had
evidently
explained
the
situation
away
for
he
listened
docilely
as
she
said
i
made
some
for
your
tea
and
if
i
late
for
supper
there
a
dish
of
macaroni
cheese
you
must
put
in
the
oven
and
a
tin
of
tomatoes
to
eat
with
it
and
there
is
a
little
rhubarb
and
shape
she
told
them
off
on
her
fingers
and
then
whisked
him
round
and
buckled
the
wagging
straps
at
the
back
of
his
waistcoat
he
was
a
lank
man
with
curly
gray
hairs
growing
from
every
place
where
it
is
inadvisable
that
hairs
should
grow
from
the
inside
of
his
ears
from
his
nostrils
on
the
back
of
his
hands
but
he
looked
pleased
when
she
touched
him
and
he
said
in
a
devoted
way
very
well
dear
do
worry
about
me
i
trot
along
after
tea
and
have
a
game
of
draughts
with
brown
she
answered
yes
dear
and
now
get
on
with
those
cabbages
you
going
to
keep
me
in
lovely
cabbages
just
as
you
did
last
year
wo
you
darling
she
linked
arms
with
him
and
took
him
back
to
his
digging
when
she
came
back
into
the
parlor
again
she
was
wearing
that
yellowish
raincoat
that
hat
with
hearse
plumes
nodding
over
its
sticky
straw
that
gray
alpaca
skirt
i
first
defensively
clenched
my
hands
it
would
have
been
such
agony
to
the
to
touch
any
part
of
her
apparel
and
then
i
thought
of
chris
to
whom
a
second
before
i
had
hoped
to
bring
a
serene
comforter
i
perceived
clearly
that
that
ecstatic
woman
lifting
her
eyes
and
her
hands
to
the
benediction
of
love
was
margaret
as
she
existed
in
eternity
but
this
was
margaret
as
she
existed
in
time
as
the
fifteen
years
between
monkey
island
and
this
damp
day
in
ladysmith
road
had
irreparably
made
her
well
i
had
promised
to
bring
her
to
him
she
said
i
ready
and
against
that
simple
view
of
her
condition
i
had
no
argument
but
when
she
paused
by
the
painted
drainpipe
in
the
hall
and
peered
under
contracted
brows
for
that
unveracious
tortoiseshell
handle
i
said
hastily
oh
do
trouble
about
an
umbrella
i
maybe
need
it
walking
home
she
pondered
but
the
car
will
bring
you
back
oh
that
will
be
lovely
she
said
and
laughed
nervously
looking
very
plain
do
you
know
i
know
the
way
we
coming
together
is
terrible
but
i
ca
think
of
a
meeting
with
chris
as
anything
but
a
kind
of
treat
i
got
a
sort
of
party
feeling
now
as
she
held
the
gate
open
for
me
she
looked
back
at
the
house
it
a
horrid
little
house
is
it
she
asked
she
evidently
desired
sanction
for
a
discontent
it
is
very
nice
i
agreed
they
put
cows
sometimes
into
the
field
at
the
back
she
went
on
as
if
conscientiously
counting
her
blessings
i
like
that
but
otherwise
it
is
much
but
it
got
a
very
pretty
name
i
said
laying
my
hand
on
the
raised
metal
letters
that
spelled
mariposa
across
the
gate
ah
is
it
she
exclaimed
with
the
smile
of
the
inveterate
romanticist
it
spanish
you
know
for
butterfly
once
we
were
in
the
automobile
she
became
a
little
sullen
with
shyness
because
she
felt
herself
so
big
and
clumsy
her
clothes
so
coarse
against
the
fine
upholstery
the
silver
vase
of
christmas
roses
and
all
the
deliberate
delicacy
of
kitty
car
she
was
afraid
of
the
chauffeur
as
the
poor
are
always
afraid
of
and
ducked
her
head
when
he
got
out
to
start
the
car
to
recall
her
to
ease
and
beauty
i
told
her
that
though
chris
had
told
me
all
about
their
meeting
he
knew
nothing
of
their
parting
and
that
i
wished
very
much
to
hear
what
had
happened
in
a
deep
embarrassed
voice
she
began
to
tell
me
about
monkey
island
it
was
strange
how
both
chris
and
she
spoke
of
it
as
though
it
were
not
a
place
but
a
magic
state
which
largely
explained
the
actions
performed
in
it
strange
too
that
both
of
them
should
describe
meticulously
the
one
white
hawthorn
that
stood
among
the
poplars
by
the
i
suppose
a
thing
that
one
has
looked
at
with
some
one
one
loves
acquires
forever
after
a
special
significance
she
said
that
her
father
had
gone
there
when
she
was
fourteen
after
arlington
had
been
taken
away
by
a
swift
and
painful
death
the
cheer
of
his
windsor
hostelry
had
become
intolerable
to
the
man
he
regarded
the
whole
world
as
her
grave
and
the
tipsy
sergeants
in
scarlet
the
carter
crying
for
a
pint
of
and
even
the
mares
dipping
their
mild
noses
to
the
trough
in
the
courtyard
seemed
to
be
defiling
it
by
their
happy
simple
appetites
so
they
went
to
monkey
island
the
utter
difference
of
which
was
a
healing
and
settled
down
happily
in
its
green
silence
all
the
summer
was
lovely
quiet
kind
people
schoolmasters
who
fished
men
who
wrote
books
married
couples
who
still
loved
solitude
used
to
come
and
stay
in
the
bright
little
inn
and
all
the
winter
was
lovely
too
her
temperament
could
see
an
adventure
in
taking
up
the
carpets
because
the
thames
was
coming
into
the
that
was
the
tale
of
her
life
for
four
years
with
her
head
on
one
side
and
the
air
of
judging
this
question
by
the
light
of
experience
she
pronounced
that
she
had
then
been
happy
then
one
april
afternoon
chris
landed
at
the
island
and
by
the
first
clean
quick
movement
of
tying
up
his
boat
made
her
his
slave
i
could
imagine
that
it
would
be
so
he
was
wonderful
when
he
was
young
he
possessed
in
great
measure
the
loveliness
of
young
men
which
is
like
the
loveliness
of
the
spry
foal
or
the
sapling
but
in
him
it
was
vexed
into
a
serious
and
moving
beauty
by
the
inhabiting
soul
when
the
sunlight
lay
on
him
disclosing
the
gold
hairs
on
his
brown
head
or
when
he
was
subject
to
any
other
physical
pleasure
there
was
always
reserve
in
his
response
to
it
from
his
eyes
which
though
gray
were
somehow
dark
with
speculation
one
perceived
that
he
was
distracted
by
participation
in
some
spiritual
drama
to
see
him
was
to
desire
intimacy
with
him
so
that
one
might
intervene
between
this
body
which
was
formed
for
happiness
and
this
soul
which
cherished
so
deep
a
faith
in
tragedy
well
she
gave
chris
ducks
eggs
for
tea
no
one
ever
had
ducks
eggs
like
father
did
it
was
his
way
of
feeding
them
it
pay
of
course
but
they
were
good
before
the
afternoon
was
out
he
had
snared
them
all
with
the
silken
net
of
his
fine
manners
he
had
talked
to
father
about
his
poultry
and
had
walked
about
the
runs
and
shown
an
intelligent
interest
and
then
as
on
many
succeeding
days
he
had
laid
his
charm
at
the
girl
feet
but
i
thought
he
must
be
some
one
royal
and
when
he
kept
on
coming
i
thought
it
must
be
for
the
ducks
eggs
then
her
damp
dull
skin
flushed
suddenly
to
a
warm
glory
and
she
began
to
stammer
i
know
all
about
that
i
said
quickly
i
was
more
afraid
that
i
should
feel
envy
or
any
base
passion
in
the
presence
of
this
woman
than
i
have
ever
been
of
anything
else
in
my
life
i
want
to
hear
how
you
came
to
part
oh
she
cried
it
was
the
silliest
quarrel
we
had
known
how
we
felt
for
just
a
week
such
a
week
lovely
weather
we
had
and
father
noticed
anything
i
did
want
him
to
because
i
thought
father
might
want
the
marriage
soon
and
think
any
delay
a
slight
on
me
and
i
knew
we
would
have
to
wait
eh
i
can
remember
saying
to
myself
five
years
trying
to
make
it
as
bad
as
could
be
so
that
if
we
could
marry
sooner
it
would
be
a
lovely
surprise
she
repeated
with
soft
irony
perhaps
five
years
well
then
one
thursday
afternoon
i
gone
on
the
with
bert
batchard
nephew
to
batchard
who
keeps
the
inn
at
surly
hall
i
was
laughing
out
loud
because
he
did
row
so
funny
he
a
town
chap
and
he
was
handling
those
oars
for
all
the
world
as
though
they
were
teaspoons
the
old
dinghy
just
sat
on
the
water
like
a
hen
on
its
chicks
and
move
and
he
so
sure
of
himself
i
just
sat
and
laughed
and
laughed
then
all
of
a
sudden
clang
the
bell
at
the
ferry
and
there
was
chris
standing
up
there
among
the
poplars
his
brows
straight
and
black
and
not
a
smile
on
him
i
felt
very
bad
we
picked
him
up
in
the
dinghy
and
took
him
across
and
still
he
did
smile
he
and
i
got
on
the
island
and
bert
who
saw
there
was
something
wrong
said
i
toddle
off
and
there
i
was
on
the
lawn
with
chris
and
he
angry
and
somehow
miles
away
i
remember
him
saying
am
i
coming
to
say
because
i
must
go
away
and
i
find
you
larking
with
that
bounder
and
i
said
chris
i
known
bert
all
my
life
through
him
coming
to
his
uncle
for
the
holidays
and
we
were
larking
it
was
only
that
he
could
row
and
he
went
on
talking
and
then
it
struck
me
he
was
trusting
me
as
he
would
trust
a
girl
of
his
own
class
and
i
told
him
so
and
he
went
on
being
cruel
oh
do
make
me
remember
the
things
we
said
to
each
other
it
does
help
at
last
i
said
something
awful
and
he
said
well
i
agree
i
go
and
he
walked
over
to
the
boy
who
was
chopping
wood
and
got
him
to
take
him
over
in
the
punt
as
he
passed
me
he
turned
away
his
face
well
all
i
had
got
the
key
at
last
there
had
been
a
spring
at
baldry
court
fifteen
years
ago
that
was
desolate
for
all
that
there
was
beautiful
weather
chris
had
lingered
with
uncle
ambrose
in
his
rectory
as
he
had
never
lingered
before
and
old
baldry
was
filling
the
house
with
a
sense
of
hot
apoplectic
misery
all
day
he
was
up
in
town
at
the
office
and
without
explanation
he
had
discontinued
his
noontide
habit
of
ringing
up
his
wife
all
night
he
used
to
sit
in
the
library
looking
over
his
papers
and
ledgers
often
in
the
mornings
the
housemaids
would
find
him
asleep
across
his
desk
very
red
yet
looking
dead
the
men
he
brought
home
to
dinner
treated
him
with
a
kindness
and
consideration
which
were
not
the
tributes
that
that
victorious
and
trumpeting
personality
was
accustomed
to
exact
and
in
the
course
of
conversation
with
them
he
dropped
braggart
hints
of
impending
ruin
which
he
would
have
found
it
humiliating
to
address
to
us
directly
at
last
there
came
a
morning
when
he
said
to
baldry
across
the
i
sent
for
chris
if
the
boy
worth
his
salt
it
was
an
appalling
admission
like
the
groan
of
an
old
ship
as
her
timbers
shiver
from
a
man
who
doubted
the
capacity
of
his
son
as
fathers
always
doubt
the
capacity
of
the
children
born
of
their
old
age
it
was
that
evening
as
i
went
down
to
see
the
new
baby
at
the
lodge
that
i
met
chris
coming
up
the
drive
through
the
blue
twilight
his
white
face
had
had
a
drowned
look
i
remembered
it
well
because
my
surprise
that
he
passed
me
without
seeing
me
had
made
me
perceive
for
the
first
time
that
he
had
never
seen
me
at
all
save
in
the
most
cursory
fashion
on
the
eye
of
his
mind
i
realized
thenceforward
i
had
hardly
impinged
that
night
he
talked
till
late
with
his
father
and
in
the
morning
he
had
started
for
mexico
to
keep
the
mines
going
to
keep
the
firm
head
above
water
and
baldry
court
sleek
and
hospitable
to
keep
everything
bright
and
splendid
save
only
his
youth
which
ever
after
that
was
dulled
by
care
something
of
this
i
told
margaret
to
which
she
answered
oh
i
know
all
that
and
went
on
with
her
story
on
sunday
three
days
after
their
quarrel
allington
was
found
dead
in
his
bed
i
wanted
chris
so
badly
but
he
never
came
he
never
wrote
and
she
fell
into
a
lethargic
disposition
to
sit
all
day
and
watch
the
thames
flow
by
from
which
she
was
hardly
roused
by
finding
that
her
father
had
left
her
nothing
save
an
income
of
twenty
pounds
a
year
from
unrealizable
stock
she
negotiated
the
transfer
of
the
lease
of
the
inn
to
a
publican
and
after
exacting
a
promise
from
the
new
hostess
that
she
would
forward
all
letters
that
might
come
embarked
upon
an
increasingly
unfortunate
career
as
a
mother
help
first
she
fell
into
the
hands
of
a
noble
irish
family
in
reduced
circumstances
whose
conduct
in
running
away
and
leaving
her
in
a
brighton
hotel
with
her
wages
and
her
bill
unpaid
still
distressed
and
perplexed
her
why
did
they
do
it
she
asked
i
liked
them
so
the
baby
was
a
darling
and
murphy
had
such
a
nice
way
of
speaking
but
it
almost
makes
one
think
evil
of
people
when
they
do
a
thing
like
that
after
two
years
of
less
sensational
but
still
uneasy
adventures
she
had
come
upon
a
large
and
needy
family
called
watson
who
lived
at
chiswick
and
almost
immediately
william
grey
who
was
watson
brother
had
begun
a
courtship
that
i
suspected
of
consisting
of
an
incessant
whining
up
at
her
protective
instinct
grey
she
said
softly
as
though
stating
his
chief
aim
to
affection
has
never
been
very
successful
and
still
no
letter
ever
came
so
five
years
after
she
left
monkey
island
she
married
william
grey
soon
after
their
marriage
he
lost
his
job
and
was
for
some
time
out
of
work
later
he
developed
a
weak
chest
that
needed
constant
attention
but
it
all
helped
to
pass
the
time
she
said
cheerfully
and
without
irony
so
it
happened
that
it
was
not
till
two
years
after
that
she
had
the
chance
of
revisiting
monkey
island
at
first
there
was
no
money
and
later
there
was
the
necessity
of
seeking
the
healthful
breezes
of
brighton
or
bognor
or
southend
which
were
the
places
in
which
grey
chest
oddly
elected
to
thrive
and
when
these
obstacles
were
removed
she
was
lethargic
also
she
had
heard
that
the
inn
was
not
being
managed
as
it
ought
to
be
and
she
could
not
have
borne
to
see
the
green
home
of
her
youth
defiled
but
then
there
had
come
a
time
when
she
had
been
very
much
upset
she
glared
a
little
wildly
at
me
as
she
said
this
as
if
she
would
faint
if
i
asked
her
any
questions
and
then
she
had
suddenly
become
obsessed
with
a
desire
to
see
monkey
island
once
more
well
when
we
got
to
the
ferry
grey
says
mercy
margaret
there
water
all
round
it
and
i
said
that
just
it
they
found
that
the
island
was
clean
and
decorous
again
for
it
had
only
recently
changed
hands
father
and
daughter
the
new
people
are
just
like
me
and
dad
and
taylor
something
of
dad
cut
too
but
he
comes
from
the
north
but
miss
taylor
much
handsomer
than
i
ever
was
a
really
big
woman
she
is
and
such
lovely
golden
hair
they
were
very
kind
when
i
told
them
who
i
was
gave
us
duck
and
green
peas
for
lunch
and
i
did
think
of
dad
they
were
nothing
like
as
good
as
his
ducks
but
then
i
expect
they
paid
and
then
miss
taylor
took
william
out
to
look
at
the
garden
i
knew
he
did
like
it
for
he
always
shy
with
a
showy
woman
and
i
was
going
after
them
when
taylor
said
stop
a
minute
i
got
something
here
that
may
interest
you
just
come
in
here
he
took
me
up
to
the
roller
desk
in
the
office
and
out
of
the
drawer
he
took
twelve
letters
addressed
to
me
in
chris
handwriting
he
was
a
kind
man
he
put
me
into
a
chair
and
called
miss
taylor
in
and
told
her
to
keep
william
out
in
the
garden
as
long
as
possible
at
last
i
said
hitchcock
did
say
she
send
my
letters
on
and
he
said
hitchcock
had
been
here
three
weeks
before
she
bolted
with
a
bookie
from
bray
and
after
that
hitchcock
mixed
his
drinks
and
got
careless
he
said
they
had
found
these
stuffed
into
the
desk
and
what
was
in
them
for
a
long
time
i
did
not
read
them
i
thought
it
was
against
my
duty
as
a
wife
but
when
i
got
that
telegram
saying
he
was
wounded
i
went
and
read
those
letters
oh
those
letters
she
bowed
her
head
and
wept
as
the
car
swung
through
the
gates
of
baldry
court
she
sat
up
and
dried
her
eyes
she
looked
out
at
the
strip
of
turf
so
bright
that
one
would
think
it
wet
and
lighted
here
and
there
with
snowdrops
and
scillas
and
crocuses
that
runs
between
the
drive
and
the
tangle
of
silver
birch
and
bramble
and
fern
there
is
no
esthetic
reason
for
that
border
the
common
outside
looks
lovelier
where
it
fringes
the
road
with
dark
gorse
and
rough
amber
grasses
its
use
is
purely
philosophic
it
proclaims
that
here
we
esteem
only
controlled
beauty
that
the
wild
will
not
have
its
way
within
our
gates
that
it
must
be
made
delicate
and
decorated
into
felicity
surely
she
must
see
that
this
was
no
place
for
beauty
that
had
been
not
mellowed
but
lacerated
by
time
that
no
one
accustomed
to
live
here
could
help
wincing
at
such
external
dinginess
as
hers
but
instead
she
said
it
a
big
place
chris
must
have
worked
hard
to
keep
all
this
up
the
pity
of
this
woman
was
like
a
flaming
sword
no
one
had
ever
before
pitied
chris
for
the
magnificence
of
baldry
court
it
had
been
our
pretense
that
by
wearing
costly
clothes
and
organizing
a
costly
life
we
had
been
the
servants
of
his
desire
but
she
revealed
the
truth
that
although
he
did
indeed
desire
a
magnificent
house
it
was
a
house
not
built
with
hands
but
that
she
was
wise
that
the
angels
would
of
a
certainty
be
on
her
side
did
not
make
her
any
the
less
physically
offensive
to
our
atmosphere
all
my
doubts
as
to
the
wisdom
of
my
expedition
revived
in
the
little
time
we
had
to
spend
in
the
hall
waiting
for
the
tea
which
i
had
ordered
in
the
hope
that
it
might
help
margaret
to
compose
her
distressed
face
she
hovered
with
her
back
to
the
oak
table
fumbling
with
her
thread
gloves
winking
her
eyes
tapping
with
her
foot
on
the
carpet
throwing
her
weight
from
one
leg
to
the
other
and
i
constantly
contrasted
her
appearance
by
some
clumsiness
with
the
new
acquisition
of
kitty
decorative
genius
that
stood
so
close
behind
her
on
the
table
that
i
was
afraid
it
might
be
upset
by
one
of
her
spasmodic
movements
this
was
a
shallow
black
bowl
in
the
center
of
which
crouched
on
all
fours
a
white
naked
nymph
her
small
head
intently
drooped
to
the
white
flowers
that
floated
on
the
black
waters
all
around
her
beside
the
pure
black
of
the
bowl
her
rusty
plumes
looked
horrible
beside
that
white
nymph
eternally
innocent
of
all
but
the
contemplation
of
beauty
her
opaque
skin
and
her
suffering
were
offensive
beside
its
air
of
being
the
coolly
conceived
and
leisurely
executed
production
of
a
hand
and
brain
lifted
by
their
rare
quality
to
the
service
of
the
not
absolutely
necessary
her
appearance
of
having
only
for
the
moment
ceased
to
cope
with
a
vexed
and
needy
environment
struck
me
as
a
cancerous
blot
on
the
fair
world
perhaps
it
was
absurd
to
pay
attention
to
this
indictment
of
a
noble
woman
by
a
potter
toy
but
that
toy
happened
to
be
also
a
little
image
of
chris
conception
of
women
exquisite
we
were
according
to
our
equipment
unflushed
by
appetite
or
passion
even
noble
passion
our
small
heads
bent
intently
on
the
white
flowers
of
luxury
floating
on
the
black
waters
of
life
he
had
known
none
other
than
us
with
such
a
mental
habit
a
man
could
not
help
but
wince
at
margaret
i
drank
my
tea
very
slowly
because
i
previsioned
what
must
happen
in
the
next
five
minutes
down
there
by
the
pond
he
would
turn
at
the
sound
of
those
heavy
boots
on
the
path
and
with
one
glance
he
would
assess
the
age
of
her
the
rubbed
surface
of
her
the
torn
fine
texture
and
he
would
show
to
her
squalid
mask
just
such
a
blank
face
as
he
had
shown
to
kitty
piteous
mask
the
night
before
although
i
had
a
gift
for
i
knew
her
case
would
then
be
worse
than
mine
for
it
would
be
worse
to
see
as
she
would
see
the
ardor
in
his
eyes
give
place
to
kindliness
than
never
to
have
ardor
there
he
would
hesitate
she
would
make
one
of
her
harassed
gestures
and
trail
away
with
that
wet
patient
look
which
was
her
special
line
he
would
go
back
to
his
boyish
sport
with
the
skiff
i
hoped
the
brown
waters
would
not
seem
too
kind
she
would
go
back
to
mariposa
sit
on
her
bed
and
read
those
letters
and
now
she
said
brightly
as
i
put
down
my
cup
may
i
see
chris
she
had
not
a
doubt
of
the
enterprise
i
took
her
into
the
and
opened
one
of
the
french
windows
go
past
the
cedars
to
the
pond
i
told
her
he
is
rowing
there
that
is
nice
she
said
he
always
looks
so
lovely
in
a
boat
i
called
after
her
trying
to
hint
the
possibility
of
a
panic
breakdown
to
their
meeting
you
find
he
altered
she
cried
gleefully
oh
i
shall
know
him
as
i
went
i
became
aware
that
i
was
near
to
a
bodily
collapse
i
suppose
the
truth
is
that
i
was
physically
so
jealous
of
margaret
that
it
was
making
me
ill
but
suddenly
like
a
tired
person
dropping
a
weight
that
they
know
to
be
precious
but
can
not
carry
for
another
minute
my
mind
refused
to
consider
the
situation
any
longer
and
turned
to
the
perception
of
material
things
i
leaned
over
the
balustrade
and
looked
down
at
the
fineness
of
the
hall
the
deliberate
figure
of
the
nymph
in
her
circle
of
black
waters
the
clear
of
chintz
the
limpid
surface
of
the
oak
the
broken
burning
of
all
the
gay
reflected
colors
in
the
paneled
walls
i
said
to
myself
if
everything
else
goes
there
is
always
this
to
fall
back
on
and
i
went
on
pleased
that
i
was
wearing
delicate
stuffs
and
that
i
had
a
smooth
skin
pleased
that
the
walls
of
the
corridor
were
so
soft
a
twilight
blue
pleased
that
through
a
open
door
there
came
a
stream
of
light
that
made
the
carpet
blaze
its
stronger
blue
and
when
i
saw
that
it
was
the
nursery
door
that
was
open
and
that
kitty
was
sitting
in
nanny
big
chair
by
the
window
i
did
not
care
about
the
peaked
face
she
lifted
its
fairness
palely
gilt
by
the
march
sunlight
or
the
tremendous
implications
of
the
fact
that
she
had
come
to
her
dead
child
nursery
although
she
had
not
washed
her
hair
i
said
sternly
because
she
had
forgotten
that
we
lived
in
the
impregnable
fort
of
a
gracious
life
o
kitty
that
poor
battered
thing
outside
she
stared
so
grimly
out
into
the
garden
that
my
eyes
followed
her
stare
it
was
one
of
those
draggled
days
common
at
the
end
of
march
when
a
garden
looks
at
its
worst
the
wind
that
was
rolling
up
to
check
a
show
of
sunshine
had
taken
away
the
cedar
dignity
of
solid
blue
shade
had
set
the
black
firs
beating
their
arms
together
and
had
filled
the
sky
with
glaring
gray
clouds
that
dimmed
the
brilliance
of
the
crocuses
it
was
to
give
gardens
a
point
on
days
such
as
these
when
the
planned
climax
of
this
and
that
stately
tree
goes
for
nothing
that
the
old
gardeners
raised
statues
in
their
lawns
and
walks
large
things
with
a
subject
mossy
tritons
or
nymphs
with
an
urn
that
held
the
eye
even
so
in
this
unrestful
garden
one
eyes
lay
on
the
figure
in
the
yellow
raincoat
that
was
standing
still
in
the
middle
of
the
lawn
how
her
near
presence
had
been
known
by
chris
i
do
not
understand
but
there
he
was
running
across
the
lawn
as
night
after
night
i
had
seen
him
in
my
dreams
running
across
i
knew
that
so
he
would
close
his
eyes
as
he
ran
i
knew
that
so
he
would
pitch
on
his
knees
when
he
reached
safety
i
assumed
naturally
that
at
margaret
feet
lay
safety
even
before
i
saw
her
arms
brace
him
under
the
armpits
with
a
gesture
that
was
not
passionate
but
rather
the
movement
of
one
carrying
a
wounded
man
from
under
fire
but
even
when
she
had
raised
his
head
to
the
level
of
her
lips
the
central
issue
was
not
decided
i
covered
my
eyes
and
said
aloud
in
a
minute
he
will
see
her
face
her
hands
but
although
it
was
a
long
time
before
i
looked
again
they
were
still
clinging
breast
to
breast
it
was
as
though
her
embrace
fed
him
he
looked
so
strong
as
he
broke
away
they
stood
with
clasped
hands
looking
at
one
another
they
looked
straight
they
looked
delightedly
and
then
as
if
resuming
a
conversation
tiresomely
interrupted
by
some
social
obligation
they
drew
together
again
and
passed
under
the
tossing
branches
of
the
cedar
to
the
wood
beyond
i
reflected
while
kitty
shrilly
wept
how
entirely
right
chris
had
been
in
his
assertion
that
to
lovers
innumerable
things
do
not
matter
chapter
v
after
the
automobile
had
taken
margaret
away
chris
came
to
us
as
we
sat
in
the
and
after
standing
for
a
while
in
the
glow
of
the
fire
hesitantly
said
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
know
it
is
all
right
margaret
has
explained
to
me
kitty
crumpled
her
sewing
into
a
white
ball
you
mean
i
suppose
that
you
know
i
your
wife
i
pleased
that
you
describe
that
as
knowing
all
right
and
grateful
that
you
have
accepted
it
at
last
on
margaret
authority
this
is
an
occasion
that
would
make
any
wife
proud
her
irony
was
as
faintly
acrid
as
a
and
never
afterward
did
she
reach
even
that
low
pitch
of
violence
for
from
that
mild
forward
droop
of
the
head
with
which
he
received
the
mental
lunge
she
realized
suddenly
that
this
was
no
pretense
and
that
something
as
impassable
as
death
lay
between
them
thereafter
his
proceedings
evoked
no
comment
but
suffering
there
was
nothing
to
say
when
all
day
save
for
those
hours
of
the
afternoon
that
margaret
spent
with
him
he
sat
like
a
blind
man
waiting
for
his
darkness
to
lift
there
was
nothing
to
say
when
he
did
not
seem
to
see
our
flowers
yet
kept
till
they
rotted
the
daffodils
which
margaret
brought
from
the
garden
that
looked
like
an
allotment
so
kitty
lay
about
like
a
broken
doll
face
downward
on
a
sofa
with
one
limp
arm
dangling
to
the
floor
or
protruding
stiff
feet
in
fantastic
slippers
from
the
end
of
her
curtained
bed
and
i
tried
to
make
my
permanent
wear
that
mood
which
had
mitigated
the
end
of
my
journey
with
margaret
a
mood
of
intense
perception
in
which
my
strained
mind
settled
on
every
vivid
object
that
came
under
my
eyes
and
tried
to
identify
myself
with
its
brightness
and
its
lack
of
human
passion
this
does
not
mean
that
i
passed
my
day
in
a
state
of
joyous
appreciation
it
means
that
many
times
in
the
lanes
of
harrowweald
i
have
stood
for
long
looking
up
at
a
fine
tracery
of
bare
boughs
against
the
hard
high
spring
sky
while
the
cold
wind
rushed
through
my
skirts
and
chilled
me
to
the
bone
because
i
was
afraid
that
when
i
moved
my
body
and
my
attention
i
might
begin
to
think
indeed
grief
is
not
the
clear
melancholy
the
young
believe
it
it
is
like
a
siege
in
a
tropical
city
the
skin
dries
and
the
throat
parches
as
though
one
were
living
in
the
heat
of
the
desert
water
and
wine
taste
warm
in
the
mouth
and
food
is
of
the
substance
of
the
sand
one
snarls
at
one
company
thoughts
prick
one
through
sleep
like
mosquitos
a
week
after
my
journey
to
wealdstone
i
went
to
kitty
to
ask
her
to
come
for
a
walk
with
me
and
found
her
stretched
on
her
pillows
holding
a
review
of
her
underclothing
she
refused
bitterly
and
added
be
back
early
remember
gilbert
anderson
is
coming
at
four
he
our
last
hope
and
tell
that
woman
she
must
see
him
he
says
he
wants
to
see
everybody
concerned
she
continued
to
look
wanly
at
the
frail
luminous
silks
her
maid
brought
her
as
a
speculator
who
had
cornered
an
article
for
which
there
had
been
no
demand
might
look
at
his
damnably
numerous
damnably
unprofitable
freights
so
i
went
out
alone
into
a
soft
day
with
the
dispelled
winter
lurking
above
in
high
dark
clouds
under
which
there
ran
quick
fresh
currents
of
air
and
broken
shafts
of
insistent
sunshine
that
spread
a
gray
clarity
of
light
in
which
every
color
showed
sharp
and
strong
on
the
breast
that
harrowweald
turns
to
the
south
they
had
set
a
the
hurdles
and
straw
were
new
gay
notes
on
the
opaque
winter
green
of
the
slope
and
the
apprehensive
bleatings
of
the
ewes
wound
about
the
hill
like
a
river
of
sound
as
they
were
driven
up
a
lane
hidden
by
the
hedge
the
lines
of
bare
elms
darkening
the
plains
below
made
it
seem
as
though
the
tide
of
winter
had
fallen
and
left
this
bare
and
sparkling
in
the
spring
i
liked
it
so
much
that
i
opened
the
gate
and
went
and
sat
down
on
a
tree
which
had
been
torn
up
by
the
roots
in
the
great
gale
last
year
but
had
not
yet
resigned
itself
to
death
and
was
bravely
decking
its
boughs
with
purple
that
pleased
me
too
and
i
wished
i
had
some
one
with
me
to
enjoy
this
artless
little
show
of
the
new
year
i
had
not
really
wanted
kitty
the
companions
i
needed
were
chris
and
margaret
chris
would
have
talked
as
he
loved
to
do
when
he
looked
at
leisure
on
a
broad
valley
about
ideas
which
he
had
to
exclude
from
his
ordinary
hours
lest
they
should
break
the
power
of
business
over
his
mind
and
margaret
would
have
gravely
watched
the
argument
from
the
shadow
of
her
broad
hat
to
see
that
it
kept
true
like
a
housewife
watching
a
saucepan
of
milk
lest
it
should
boil
over
they
were
naturally
my
friends
these
gentle
speculative
people
then
suddenly
i
was
stunned
with
jealousy
it
was
not
their
love
for
each
other
that
caused
me
such
agony
at
that
moment
it
was
the
thought
of
the
things
their
eyes
had
rested
upon
together
i
imagined
that
white
hawthorn
among
the
poplars
by
the
ferry
on
which
they
had
looked
fifteen
years
ago
at
monkey
island
and
it
was
more
than
i
could
bear
i
thought
how
even
now
they
might
be
exclaiming
at
the
green
smoke
of
the
first
buds
on
the
brown
undergrowth
by
the
pond
and
at
that
i
slid
off
the
and
began
walking
very
quickly
down
the
hill
the
red
cows
drank
from
the
pond
cupped
by
the
a
stallion
danced
clumsily
because
warmth
was
running
through
the
ground
i
found
a
stream
in
the
fields
and
followed
it
till
it
became
a
shining
dike
embanked
with
glowing
green
and
gold
mosses
in
the
midst
of
woods
and
the
sight
of
those
things
was
no
sort
of
joy
because
my
vision
was
solitary
i
wanted
to
end
my
desperation
by
leaping
from
a
height
and
i
climbed
on
a
knoll
and
flung
myself
face
downward
on
the
dead
leaves
below
i
was
now
utterly
cut
off
from
chris
before
when
i
looked
at
him
i
knew
an
instant
ease
in
the
sight
of
the
short
golden
down
on
his
cheeks
the
ridge
of
bronze
flesh
above
his
thick
fair
eyebrows
but
now
i
was
too
busy
reassuring
him
by
showing
a
steady
undistorted
profile
crowned
by
a
neat
proud
sweep
of
hair
instead
of
the
mask
he
always
feared
ever
to
have
enough
vitality
left
over
to
enjoy
his
presence
i
spoke
in
a
calm
voice
full
from
the
chest
quite
unfluted
with
agony
i
read
country
life
with
ponderous
interest
i
kept
my
hands
which
i
desired
to
wring
in
doeskin
gloves
for
most
of
the
day
i
played
with
the
dogs
a
great
deal
and
wore
my
thickest
tweeds
i
pretended
that
the
slight
heaviness
of
my
features
is
a
correct
indication
of
my
temperament
the
only
occasion
when
i
could
safely
let
the
sense
of
him
saturate
me
as
it
used
was
when
i
met
margaret
in
the
hall
as
she
came
or
went
she
was
very
different
now
she
had
a
little
smile
in
her
eyes
as
though
she
were
listening
to
a
familiar
air
played
far
away
her
awkwardness
seemed
indecision
as
to
whether
she
should
walk
or
dance
to
that
distant
music
her
shabbiness
was
no
more
repulsive
than
the
untidiness
of
a
child
who
had
been
so
eager
to
get
to
the
party
that
it
has
not
let
its
nurse
finish
fastening
its
frock
always
she
extended
a
hand
in
an
unbuttoned
black
thread
glove
and
said
it
another
fine
day
again
or
diffidently
as
kitty
continued
to
withhold
her
presence
i
hope
baldry
is
keeping
well
then
as
our
hands
touched
he
was
with
us
invoked
by
our
common
adoration
i
felt
his
rough
male
texture
and
saw
the
clear
warmth
of
his
brown
and
gold
coloring
i
thought
of
him
with
the
passion
of
exile
to
margaret
it
was
a
call
and
she
moved
past
me
to
the
garden
holding
her
hands
in
front
of
her
as
though
she
bore
invisible
gifts
and
pausing
on
the
step
of
the
french
window
to
smile
to
herself
as
if
in
her
heart
she
turned
over
the
precious
thought
he
is
here
this
garden
holds
him
my
moment
my
small
sole
subsistence
ended
in
a
feeling
of
jealousy
as
ugly
and
unmental
as
sickness
this
was
the
saddest
spring
nothing
could
mitigate
the
harshness
of
our
dejection
you
may
think
we
were
attaching
an
altogether
fictitious
importance
to
what
was
merely
the
delusion
of
a
madman
but
every
minute
of
the
day
particularly
at
those
trying
times
when
he
strolled
about
the
house
and
grounds
with
the
doctors
smiling
courteously
but
without
joy
and
answering
their
questions
with
the
crisp
politeness
of
a
man
shaking
off
an
inquisitive
commercial
traveler
in
a
hotel
it
became
plain
that
if
madness
means
a
liability
to
wild
error
about
the
world
chris
was
not
mad
it
was
our
peculiar
shame
that
he
had
rejected
us
when
he
had
attained
to
something
saner
than
sanity
his
very
loss
of
memory
was
a
triumph
over
the
limitations
of
language
which
prevent
the
mass
of
men
from
making
explicit
statements
about
their
spiritual
relationships
if
he
had
said
to
kitty
and
me
i
do
not
know
you
we
would
have
gaped
if
he
had
expanded
his
meaning
and
said
you
are
nothing
to
me
my
heart
is
separate
from
your
hearts
we
would
have
wept
at
an
unkindness
he
had
not
intended
but
by
the
blankness
of
those
eyes
which
saw
me
only
as
a
disregarded
playmate
and
kitty
not
at
all
save
as
a
stranger
who
had
somehow
become
a
decorative
presence
in
his
home
and
the
orderer
of
his
meals
he
let
us
know
completely
where
we
were
even
though
i
lay
weeping
at
it
on
the
dead
leaves
i
was
sensible
of
the
bitter
rapture
which
attends
the
discovery
of
any
truth
i
felt
indeed
a
cold
intellectual
pride
in
his
refusal
to
remember
his
prosperous
maturity
and
his
determined
dwelling
in
the
time
of
his
first
love
for
it
showed
him
so
much
saner
than
the
rest
of
us
who
take
life
as
it
comes
loaded
with
the
unessential
and
the
irritating
i
was
even
willing
to
admit
that
this
choice
of
what
was
to
him
reality
out
of
all
the
appearances
so
copiously
presented
by
the
world
this
adroit
recovery
of
the
dropped
pearl
of
beauty
was
the
act
of
genius
i
had
always
expected
from
him
but
that
did
not
make
less
agonizing
this
exclusion
from
his
life
i
could
not
think
clearly
about
it
i
suppose
that
the
subject
of
our
tragedy
written
in
spiritual
terms
was
that
in
kitty
he
had
turned
from
the
type
of
woman
that
makes
the
body
conqueror
of
the
soul
and
in
me
the
type
that
mediates
between
the
soul
and
the
body
and
makes
them
run
even
and
unhasty
like
a
pair
of
carriage
horses
and
had
given
himself
to
a
woman
whose
bleak
habit
it
was
to
champion
the
soul
against
the
body
but
i
saw
it
just
as
a
fantastic
act
of
cruelty
that
i
could
think
of
only
as
a
conjunction
of
calamitous
images
i
think
of
it
happening
somewhere
behind
the
front
at
the
end
of
a
straight
road
that
runs
by
a
line
of
ragged
poplars
between
mud
flats
made
with
floods
pitted
by
the
soft
slow
rain
there
past
a
church
that
lacks
its
tower
stand
a
score
of
houses
each
hideous
with
patches
of
bare
bricks
that
show
like
sores
through
the
plaster
and
uncovered
rafters
that
stick
out
like
broken
bones
there
are
people
still
living
here
a
slouchy
woman
sits
at
the
door
of
a
filthy
cottage
counting
some
dirty
linen
and
waving
her
bare
arm
at
some
passing
soldiers
and
at
another
house
there
is
a
general
store
with
strings
of
orange
onions
and
bunches
of
herbs
hanging
from
the
roof
a
brown
gloom
rich
with
garlic
and
humming
with
the
flies
that
live
all
the
year
round
in
french
village
shops
a
black
cat
rubbing
her
sleepiness
against
the
lintel
it
is
in
there
that
chris
is
standing
facing
across
the
counter
an
old
man
in
a
blouse
with
a
scar
running
white
into
the
gray
thickets
of
his
beard
an
old
man
with
a
smile
at
once
lewd
and
benevolent
repulsive
with
dirt
and
yet
magnificent
by
reason
of
the
olympian
structure
of
his
body
i
think
he
is
the
soul
of
the
universe
equally
cognizant
and
disregardful
of
every
living
thing
to
whom
i
am
not
more
dear
than
the
slouchy
woman
at
the
neighboring
door
and
chris
is
leaning
on
the
counter
his
eyes
glazed
this
is
his
spirit
his
body
lies
out
there
in
the
drizzle
at
the
other
end
of
the
road
he
is
looking
down
on
the
two
crystal
balls
that
the
old
man
foul
strong
hands
have
rolled
across
to
him
in
one
he
sees
margaret
not
in
her
raincoat
and
her
nodding
plumes
but
as
she
is
transfigured
in
the
light
of
eternity
long
he
looks
there
then
drops
a
glance
to
the
other
just
long
enough
to
see
that
in
its
depths
kitty
and
i
walk
in
bright
dresses
through
our
glowing
gardens
we
had
suffered
no
transfiguration
for
we
are
as
we
are
and
there
is
nothing
more
to
us
the
whole
truth
about
us
lies
in
our
material
seeming
he
sighs
a
deep
sigh
of
delight
and
puts
out
his
hand
to
the
ball
where
margaret
shines
his
sleeve
catches
the
other
one
and
sends
it
down
to
crash
in
a
thousand
pieces
on
the
floor
the
old
man
smile
continues
to
be
lewd
and
benevolent
he
is
still
not
more
interested
in
me
than
in
the
woman
chris
is
wholly
inclosed
in
his
intentness
on
his
chosen
crystal
no
one
weeps
for
this
shattering
of
our
world
i
stirred
on
the
dead
leaves
as
though
i
had
really
heard
the
breaking
of
the
globe
and
cried
out
gilbert
anderson
gilbert
anderson
must
cure
him
heaven
knows
that
i
had
no
reason
for
faith
in
any
doctor
for
during
the
last
week
so
many
of
them
as
sleek
as
seals
with
their
neatly
brushed
hair
and
their
had
stood
round
chris
and
looked
at
him
with
the
consequenceless
deliberation
of
a
plumber
their
most
successful
enterprise
had
been
his
futile
hypnotism
he
had
submitted
to
it
as
a
man
submits
to
being
blindfolded
at
a
children
party
and
under
its
influence
had
recovered
his
memory
and
his
personality
had
talked
of
kitty
with
the
humorous
tenderness
of
the
english
husband
and
had
looked
possessively
about
him
but
as
his
mind
came
out
of
the
control
he
exposed
their
lie
that
they
were
dealing
with
a
mere
breakdown
of
the
normal
process
by
pushing
away
this
knowledge
and
turning
to
them
the
blank
wall
all
the
blanker
because
it
was
unconscious
of
his
resolution
not
to
know
i
had
accepted
that
it
would
always
be
so
but
at
that
moment
i
had
so
great
a
need
to
throw
off
my
mood
of
despair
so
insupportably
loaded
with
all
the
fantastic
images
to
which
my
fevered
mind
transmuted
the
facts
of
our
tragedy
that
i
filled
myself
with
a
gasping
urgent
faith
in
this
new
doctor
i
jumped
up
and
pushed
through
the
brambles
to
the
hedge
that
divided
the
preserves
in
which
i
was
trespassing
from
our
own
woods
breathless
because
i
had
let
it
go
past
four
and
i
had
still
to
find
chris
and
margaret
for
the
doctor
visit
at
the
there
had
been
a
hardening
of
the
light
while
i
slept
that
made
the
dear
familiar
woods
rich
and
sinister
and
to
the
eye
tropical
the
buds
on
the
boughs
the
blue
valley
distances
smudged
here
and
there
with
the
pink
enamel
of
and
seen
between
the
intricacies
of
the
and
the
luminous
gray
pillars
of
the
beeches
hurt
my
wet
eyes
as
might
beauty
blazing
under
an
equatorial
sun
there
was
a
tropical
sense
of
danger
too
for
i
walked
as
apprehensively
as
though
a
snake
coiled
under
every
leaf
because
i
feared
to
come
on
them
when
he
was
speaking
to
her
without
looking
at
her
or
thinking
in
silence
while
he
played
with
her
hand
embraces
do
not
matter
they
merely
indicate
the
will
to
love
and
may
as
well
be
followed
by
defeat
as
victory
but
disregard
means
that
now
there
needs
to
be
no
straining
of
the
eyes
no
stretching
forth
of
the
hands
no
pressing
of
the
lips
because
theirs
is
such
a
union
that
they
are
no
longer
aware
of
the
division
of
their
flesh
i
know
it
must
be
so
a
lonely
life
gives
one
opportunities
of
thinking
these
things
out
i
could
not
have
borne
to
see
signs
of
how
he
had
achieved
this
intimacy
with
the
woman
whom
a
sudden
widening
of
the
downward
vista
showed
as
she
leaned
her
bent
back
ridged
by
her
cheap
stays
against
a
birch
that
some
special
skill
of
our
forester
had
made
wonderful
for
its
straight
slenderness
against
the
clear
colors
of
the
bright
bare
wood
her
yellow
raincoat
made
a
muddy
patch
and
as
a
dead
bough
dropped
near
her
she
made
a
squalid
dodging
movement
like
a
hen
she
was
not
so
much
a
person
as
an
implication
of
dreary
poverty
like
an
open
door
in
a
mean
house
that
lets
out
the
smell
of
cooking
cabbage
and
the
screams
of
children
doubtlessly
he
sat
somewhere
close
to
her
lumpishly
content
i
thought
distractedly
how
necessary
it
was
that
gilbert
anderson
should
cure
him
and
tried
to
shout
to
her
but
found
my
throat
full
of
sobs
so
i
broke
my
way
down
through
the
fern
and
bramble
and
stood
level
with
them
though
still
divided
by
some
yards
of
broken
ground
it
was
not
utter
dullness
not
to
have
anticipated
the
beauty
that
i
saw
no
one
could
have
told
they
had
taken
the
mackintosh
rug
out
of
the
dinghy
and
spread
it
on
this
little
space
of
clear
grass
i
think
so
that
they
could
look
at
a
scattering
of
early
primroses
in
a
pool
of
white
anemones
at
an
foot
she
had
run
her
hands
over
the
rug
so
that
it
lay
quite
smooth
and
comfortable
under
him
when
at
last
he
felt
drowsy
and
turned
on
his
side
to
sleep
he
lay
there
in
the
confiding
relaxation
of
a
sleeping
child
his
hands
unclenched
and
his
head
thrown
back
so
that
the
bare
throat
showed
defenselessly
now
he
was
asleep
and
his
face
undarkened
by
thought
one
saw
how
very
fair
he
really
was
and
she
her
mournfully
vigilant
face
pinkened
by
the
cold
river
of
air
sent
by
the
advancing
evening
through
the
screen
of
bracken
behind
her
was
sitting
by
him
just
watching
i
have
often
seen
people
grouped
like
that
on
the
common
outside
our
gates
on
bank
holidays
most
often
the
man
has
a
handkerchief
over
his
face
to
shade
him
from
the
sun
and
the
woman
squats
beside
him
and
peers
through
the
undergrowth
to
see
that
the
children
come
to
no
harm
as
they
play
it
has
sometimes
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
a
significance
about
it
you
know
when
one
goes
into
the
damp
odorous
coolness
of
a
church
in
a
catholic
country
and
sees
the
kneeling
worshipers
their
bodies
bent
stiffly
and
reluctantly
and
yet
with
abandonment
as
though
to
represent
the
inevitable
bending
of
the
will
to
a
purpose
outside
the
individual
person
or
when
under
any
sky
one
sees
a
mother
with
her
child
in
her
arms
something
turns
in
one
heart
like
a
sword
and
one
says
to
oneself
if
humanity
forgets
these
attitudes
there
is
an
end
to
the
world
but
people
like
me
who
are
not
artists
are
never
sure
about
people
they
do
know
so
it
was
not
until
now
when
it
happened
to
my
friends
when
it
was
my
dear
chris
and
my
dear
margaret
who
sat
thus
englobed
in
peace
as
in
a
crystal
sphere
that
i
knew
it
was
the
most
significant
as
it
was
the
loveliest
attitude
in
the
world
it
means
that
the
woman
has
gathered
the
soul
of
the
man
into
her
soul
and
is
keeping
it
warm
in
love
and
peace
so
that
his
body
can
rest
quiet
for
a
little
time
that
is
a
great
thing
for
a
woman
to
do
i
know
there
are
things
at
least
as
great
for
those
women
whose
independent
spirits
can
ride
fearlessly
and
with
interest
outside
the
home
park
of
their
personal
relationships
but
independence
is
not
the
occupation
of
most
of
us
what
we
desire
is
greatness
such
as
this
which
had
given
sleep
to
the
beloved
i
had
known
that
he
was
having
bad
nights
at
baldry
court
in
that
new
room
with
the
painted
walls
and
the
fireplace
which
he
found
with
surprise
to
be
his
instead
of
the
remembered
little
room
with
the
but
i
had
not
been
able
to
do
anything
about
it
it
was
not
fair
that
by
the
exercise
of
a
generosity
which
seemed
as
fortuitous
a
possession
as
a
beautiful
voice
a
woman
should
be
able
to
do
such
wonderful
things
for
a
man
for
sleep
was
the
least
of
her
gifts
to
him
what
she
had
done
in
leading
him
into
the
quiet
magic
circle
out
of
our
life
out
of
the
splendid
house
which
was
not
so
much
a
house
as
a
vast
piece
of
space
partitioned
off
from
the
universe
and
decorated
partly
for
beauty
and
partly
to
make
our
privacy
more
insolent
out
of
the
garden
where
the
flowers
took
thought
as
to
how
they
should
grow
and
the
wood
made
as
formal
as
a
pillared
aisle
by
forestry
may
be
judged
from
my
anguish
in
being
left
there
alone
indeed
she
had
been
generous
to
us
all
for
at
her
touch
our
lives
had
at
last
fallen
into
a
pattern
she
was
the
sober
thread
the
interweaving
of
which
with
our
scattered
magnificences
had
somewhat
achieved
the
design
that
otherwise
would
not
appear
perhaps
even
her
dinginess
was
part
of
her
generosity
for
in
order
to
fit
into
the
pattern
one
has
sometimes
to
forego
something
of
one
individual
beauty
that
is
why
women
like
us
do
not
wear
such
obviously
lovely
dresses
as
cocottes
but
clothe
ourselves
in
garments
that
by
their
slight
neglect
of
the
possibilities
of
beauty
declare
that
there
are
such
things
as
thrift
and
restraint
and
care
for
the
future
and
so
i
could
believe
of
margaret
that
her
determined
dwelling
in
places
where
there
was
not
enough
of
anything
her
continued
exposure
of
herself
to
the
grime
of
squalid
living
was
unconsciously
deliberate
the
deep
internal
thing
that
had
guided
chris
to
forgetfulness
had
guided
her
to
poverty
so
that
when
the
time
came
for
her
meeting
with
her
lover
there
should
be
not
one
intimation
of
the
beauty
of
suave
flesh
to
distract
him
from
the
message
of
her
soul
i
looked
upward
at
this
supreme
act
of
sacrifice
and
glowed
at
her
private
gift
to
me
my
sleep
though
short
was
now
dreamless
no
more
did
i
see
his
body
rotting
into
union
with
that
brown
texture
of
corruption
which
is
no
more
did
i
see
him
slipping
softly
down
the
parapet
into
the
trench
no
more
did
i
hear
voices
talking
in
a
void
help
me
old
man
i
got
no
legs
i
ca
old
man
i
got
no
hands
they
could
not
take
him
back
to
the
army
as
he
was
only
that
morning
as
i
went
through
the
library
he
had
raised
an
appalled
face
from
the
pages
of
a
history
of
the
war
jenny
it
ca
be
true
that
they
did
that
to
belgium
those
funny
quiet
stingy
people
and
his
soldierly
knowledge
was
as
deeply
buried
as
this
memory
of
that
awful
august
while
her
spell
endured
they
could
not
send
him
back
into
the
hell
of
war
this
wonderful
kind
woman
held
his
body
as
safely
as
she
held
his
soul
i
was
so
grateful
that
i
was
forced
to
go
and
sit
down
on
the
rug
beside
her
it
was
an
intrusion
but
i
wanted
to
be
near
her
she
did
not
look
surprised
when
she
turned
to
me
her
puckered
brows
but
smiled
through
the
ugly
fringe
of
vagrant
hairs
the
weather
had
plucked
from
under
the
hard
rim
of
her
hat
it
was
part
of
her
loveliness
that
even
if
she
did
not
understand
an
act
she
could
accept
it
presently
she
leaned
over
to
me
across
his
body
and
whispered
he
not
cold
i
put
the
overcoat
on
him
as
soon
as
he
was
fairly
off
i
just
felt
his
hands
and
they
as
warm
as
toast
if
i
had
whispered
like
that
i
would
have
wakened
him
soon
he
stirred
groped
for
her
hand
and
lay
with
his
cheek
against
the
rough
palm
he
was
awake
but
liked
to
lie
so
in
a
little
she
shook
her
hand
away
and
said
get
up
and
run
along
to
the
house
and
have
some
hot
tea
you
catch
your
death
lying
out
here
he
caught
her
hand
again
it
was
evident
that
for
some
reason
the
moment
was
charged
with
ecstasy
for
them
both
it
seemed
as
though
there
was
a
softer
air
in
this
small
clearing
than
anywhere
else
in
the
world
i
stood
up
with
my
back
against
a
birch
and
said
negligently
knowing
now
that
nothing
could
really
threaten
them
there
is
a
doctor
coming
at
four
who
wants
to
see
you
both
it
cast
no
shadow
on
their
serenity
he
smiled
upward
still
lying
on
his
back
and
hailed
me
hallo
jenny
but
she
made
him
get
up
and
help
her
to
fold
the
rug
it
not
right
to
keep
a
doctor
waiting
in
these
times
she
declared
so
overworked
they
are
poor
men
since
the
war
as
i
led
the
way
up
through
the
woods
to
the
house
i
heard
her
prove
her
point
by
an
illustrative
anecdote
about
something
that
had
happened
down
her
road
i
heard
too
their
footsteps
come
to
a
halt
for
a
space
i
think
her
gray
eyes
had
looked
at
him
so
sweetly
that
he
had
been
constrained
to
take
her
in
his
arms
chapter
vi
i
felt
i
remember
with
the
little
perk
of
with
which
one
remembers
any
sort
of
accurate
premonition
even
if
its
fulfilment
means
disaster
a
cold
hand
close
round
my
heart
as
we
turned
the
corner
of
the
house
and
came
on
gilbert
anderson
i
was
startled
to
begin
with
by
his
unmedical
appearance
he
was
a
little
man
with
winking
blue
eyes
a
flushed
and
crumpled
forehead
a
little
gray
mustache
that
gave
him
the
profile
of
an
amiable
cat
and
a
lively
taste
in
spotted
ties
and
he
lacked
that
appetiteless
look
which
is
affected
by
distinguished
practitioners
he
was
at
once
more
comical
and
more
suggestive
of
power
than
any
other
doctor
i
had
ever
seen
and
this
difference
was
emphasized
by
his
unexpected
occupation
a
which
he
had
discovered
somewhere
had
roused
his
sporting
instincts
and
he
was
trying
at
what
range
it
was
possible
to
kick
it
between
two
large
stones
which
he
had
placed
close
together
in
front
of
the
steps
up
to
the
house
it
was
his
chubby
absorption
in
this
amusement
which
accounted
for
his
first
moment
of
embarrassment
nobody
about
in
there
we
professional
men
get
so
little
fresh
air
he
said
bluffly
and
blew
his
nose
in
a
very
large
handkerchief
from
the
folds
of
which
he
emerged
with
perfect
you
he
said
to
chris
with
a
naïve
adoption
of
the
detective
tone
are
the
patient
he
rolled
his
blue
eye
on
me
took
a
good
look
and
as
he
realized
i
did
not
matter
shook
off
the
unnecessary
impression
like
a
dog
coming
out
of
water
he
faced
margaret
as
though
she
were
the
nurse
in
charge
of
the
case
and
gave
her
a
brisk
little
nod
you
grey
i
shall
want
to
talk
to
you
later
meantime
this
man
i
come
back
he
indicated
by
a
windmill
gesture
that
we
should
go
into
the
house
and
swung
off
with
chris
she
obeyed
that
sort
of
woman
always
does
what
the
doctor
orders
but
i
delayed
for
a
moment
to
stare
after
this
singular
specialist
to
sidetrack
my
foreboding
by
pronouncing
him
a
bounder
to
wish
as
my
foreboding
persisted
that
like
a
servant
i
could
give
notice
because
there
was
always
something
happening
in
the
house
then
as
the
obedient
figure
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
was
plainly
shivering
under
its
shoddy
clothes
in
the
rising
wind
that
was
polishing
the
end
of
the
afternoon
to
brightness
i
hastened
to
lead
her
into
the
hall
we
stood
about
uneasily
in
its
gloaming
margaret
looked
round
her
and
said
in
a
voice
flattened
by
the
despondency
she
evidently
shared
with
me
it
is
nice
to
have
everything
ready
that
people
can
want
and
everything
in
its
place
i
used
to
do
it
at
monkey
island
inn
it
was
not
grand
like
this
of
course
but
our
visitors
always
came
back
a
second
time
abstractedly
and
yet
with
joy
she
fingered
the
fine
work
of
the
there
was
a
noise
above
us
like
the
fluttering
of
doves
kitty
was
coming
downstairs
in
a
white
serge
dress
against
which
her
hands
were
rosy
a
woman
with
such
lovely
little
hands
never
needed
to
wear
flowers
by
her
kind
of
physical
discipline
she
had
reduced
her
grief
to
no
more
than
a
slight
darkening
under
the
eyes
and
for
this
moment
she
was
glowing
i
knew
it
was
because
she
was
going
to
meet
a
new
man
and
anticipated
the
kindling
of
admiration
in
his
eyes
and
i
smiled
contrasting
her
probable
prefiguring
of
anderson
with
the
amiable
rotundity
we
had
just
encountered
not
that
it
would
have
made
any
difference
if
she
had
seen
him
beautiful
women
of
her
type
lose
in
this
matter
of
admiration
alone
their
otherwise
tremendous
sense
of
class
distinction
they
are
obscurely
aware
that
it
is
their
civilizing
mission
to
flash
the
jewel
of
their
beauty
before
all
men
so
that
they
shall
desire
it
and
work
to
get
the
wealth
to
buy
it
and
thus
be
seduced
by
a
present
appetite
to
a
tilling
of
the
earth
that
serves
the
future
there
is
you
know
really
room
for
all
of
us
we
each
have
our
peculiar
use
the
doctor
talking
to
chris
outside
i
said
ah
breathed
kitty
i
found
though
the
occasion
was
a
little
grim
some
entertainment
in
the
two
women
faces
so
mutually
intent
so
differently
fair
the
one
a
polished
surface
that
reflected
light
like
a
mirror
hung
opposite
a
window
the
other
a
lamp
grimed
by
the
smoke
of
careless
use
but
still
giving
out
radiance
from
its
burning
oil
margaret
was
smiling
wonderingly
up
at
this
prettiness
but
kitty
seemed
to
be
doing
some
brainwork
how
do
you
do
mrs
grey
she
said
suddenly
shaking
out
her
cordiality
as
one
shakes
out
a
fan
it
very
kind
of
you
wo
you
go
and
take
off
your
things
no
thank
you
answered
margaret
shyly
i
shall
have
to
go
away
so
soon
ah
do
begged
kitty
prettily
it
was
of
course
that
she
did
not
want
margaret
to
meet
the
specialist
in
those
awful
clothes
but
i
did
not
darken
the
situation
by
explaining
that
this
disaster
had
already
happened
instead
i
turned
to
margaret
an
expression
which
conveyed
that
this
was
an
act
of
hospitality
the
refusal
of
which
we
would
find
wounding
and
to
that
she
yielded
as
i
knew
she
would
she
followed
me
and
along
the
corridors
very
slowly
like
a
child
paddling
in
a
summer
sea
she
enjoyed
the
feeling
of
the
thick
carpet
underfoot
she
looked
lingeringly
at
the
pictures
on
the
wall
occasionally
she
put
a
finger
to
touch
a
vase
as
if
by
that
she
made
its
preciousness
more
her
own
her
spirit
i
could
see
was
as
deeply
concerned
about
chris
as
was
mine
but
she
had
such
faith
in
life
that
she
retained
serenity
enough
to
enjoy
what
beauty
she
came
across
in
her
period
of
waiting
even
her
enjoyment
was
indirectly
generous
when
she
came
into
my
room
the
backward
flinging
of
her
head
and
her
deep
oh
recalled
to
me
what
i
had
long
forgotten
how
fine
were
its
proportions
how
clever
the
grooved
arch
above
the
window
how
like
the
evening
sky
my
blue
curtains
and
the
lovely
things
you
have
on
your
she
commented
you
must
have
very
good
taste
the
charity
that
changed
my
riches
to
a
merit
as
i
helped
her
to
take
off
her
raincoat
and
reflected
that
kitty
would
not
be
pleased
when
she
saw
that
the
removal
of
the
garment
disclosed
a
purple
blouse
of
stuff
called
moirette
that
servants
use
for
petticoats
she
exclaimed
softly
kitty
praises
i
know
i
make
personal
remarks
but
baldry
is
lovely
she
has
three
circles
round
her
neck
i
only
two
it
was
a
touching
betrayal
that
she
possessed
that
intimate
knowledge
of
her
own
person
which
comes
to
women
who
have
been
loved
i
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
have
told
you
how
many
circles
there
were
round
my
neck
plainly
discontented
with
herself
in
the
midst
of
all
this
fineness
she
said
diffidently
please
i
would
like
to
do
my
hair
so
i
pulled
the
up
to
the
and
leaned
on
its
back
while
she
sitting
shyly
on
its
very
edge
unpinned
her
two
long
braids
so
thick
so
dull
you
lovely
hair
i
said
i
used
to
have
nice
hair
she
mourned
but
these
last
few
years
let
myself
go
she
made
attempts
to
smooth
the
straggling
tendrils
on
her
temples
but
presently
laid
down
her
brush
and
clicked
her
tongue
against
her
teeth
i
hope
that
man
not
worrying
chris
she
said
there
was
no
reassurance
ready
so
i
went
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
to
put
her
hat
down
on
a
chair
and
stayed
for
a
moment
to
pat
its
plumes
and
wonder
if
nothing
could
be
done
with
it
but
it
was
as
surgeons
say
an
inoperable
case
so
i
just
gloomed
at
it
and
wished
i
had
not
let
this
doctor
interpose
his
plumpness
between
chris
and
margaret
who
since
that
afternoon
seemed
to
me
as
not
only
a
woman
whom
it
was
good
to
love
but
as
a
patron
saint
must
appear
to
a
catholic
as
an
intercessory
being
whose
kindliness
could
be
daunted
only
by
some
special
and
incredibly
malicious
decision
of
the
supreme
force
i
was
standing
with
eyes
closed
and
my
hands
abstractedly
stroking
the
hat
that
was
the
emblem
of
her
martyrdom
and
i
was
thinking
of
her
in
a
way
that
was
a
prayer
to
her
when
i
heard
her
sharp
cry
that
she
whose
essence
was
a
patient
silence
should
cry
out
sharply
startled
me
strangely
i
turned
quickly
she
was
standing
up
and
in
her
hand
she
held
the
photograph
of
oliver
that
i
keep
on
my
it
is
his
last
photograph
the
one
taken
just
a
week
before
he
died
who
is
this
she
asked
the
only
child
chris
ever
had
he
died
five
years
ago
five
years
ago
why
did
it
matter
so
yes
i
said
died
five
years
ago
my
dick
her
eyes
grew
great
how
old
was
he
just
two
my
dick
was
two
we
both
were
breathing
hard
why
did
he
die
we
never
knew
he
was
the
loveliest
boy
but
delicate
from
his
birth
at
the
end
he
just
faded
away
with
the
merest
cold
so
did
my
dick
a
chill
we
thought
he
would
be
up
and
about
the
next
day
and
he
just
her
awful
gesture
of
regret
was
suddenly
paralyzed
she
seemed
to
be
fighting
her
way
to
a
discovery
it
it
as
if
she
stammered
they
each
had
half
a
life
i
felt
the
usual
instinct
to
treat
her
as
though
she
were
ill
because
it
was
evident
that
she
was
sustained
by
a
mystic
interpretation
of
life
but
she
had
already
taught
me
something
so
i
stood
aside
while
she
fell
on
her
knees
and
wondered
why
she
did
not
look
at
the
photograph
but
pressed
it
to
her
bosom
as
though
to
stanch
a
wound
i
thought
as
i
have
often
thought
before
that
the
childless
have
the
greatest
joy
in
children
for
to
us
they
are
just
slips
of
immaturity
lovelier
than
the
flowers
and
with
the
power
over
the
heart
but
to
mothers
they
are
fleshly
cables
binding
one
down
to
such
profundities
of
feeling
as
the
awful
agony
that
now
possessed
her
for
although
i
knew
i
would
have
accepted
it
with
rapture
because
it
was
the
result
of
intimacy
with
chris
its
awfulness
appalled
me
not
only
did
it
make
my
body
hurt
with
sympathy
it
shook
the
ground
beneath
my
feet
for
that
her
serenity
which
a
moment
before
had
seemed
as
steady
as
the
earth
and
as
as
the
sky
should
be
so
utterly
dispelled
made
me
aware
that
i
had
of
late
been
underestimating
the
cruelty
of
the
order
of
things
lovers
are
frustrated
children
are
not
begotten
that
should
have
had
the
loveliest
life
the
pale
usurpers
of
their
birth
die
young
such
a
world
will
not
suffer
magic
circles
to
endure
the
knocked
at
the
door
baldry
and
anderson
are
waiting
in
the
margaret
reassumed
her
majesty
and
put
her
white
face
close
to
the
glass
as
she
pinned
up
her
braids
i
knew
there
was
a
something
she
moaned
and
set
the
all
awry
more
she
could
not
say
though
i
clung
to
her
and
begged
her
but
the
slow
gesture
with
which
as
we
were
about
to
leave
the
room
she
laid
her
hand
across
the
child
photograph
somehow
convinced
me
that
we
were
not
to
be
victorious
when
we
went
into
the
we
found
anderson
plump
and
expository
balancing
himself
on
the
balls
of
his
feet
on
the
and
enjoying
the
caress
of
the
fire
on
his
calves
while
kitty
showing
against
the
dark
frame
of
her
oak
chair
like
a
white
rosebud
that
was
still
too
innocent
to
bloom
listened
with
that
slight
reservation
of
the
attention
customary
in
beautiful
women
a
complete
case
of
amnesia
he
was
saying
as
margaret
yet
less
shy
than
i
had
ever
seen
her
went
to
a
seat
by
the
window
and
i
sank
down
on
the
sofa
his
unconscious
self
is
refusing
to
let
him
resume
his
relations
with
his
normal
life
and
so
we
get
this
loss
of
memory
i
always
said
declared
kitty
with
an
air
of
good
sense
that
if
he
would
make
an
effort
effort
he
jerked
his
round
head
about
the
mental
life
that
can
be
controlled
by
effort
is
the
mental
life
that
matters
you
been
stuffed
up
when
you
were
young
with
talk
about
a
thing
called
a
sort
of
barmaid
of
the
soul
that
says
up
gentlemen
and
you
had
enough
there
no
such
thing
there
a
deep
self
in
one
the
essential
self
that
has
its
wishes
and
if
those
wishes
are
suppressed
by
the
superficial
self
the
self
that
makes
as
you
say
efforts
and
usually
makes
them
with
the
sole
idea
of
putting
up
a
good
show
before
the
neighbors
it
takes
its
revenge
into
the
house
of
conduct
erected
by
the
superficial
self
it
sends
an
obsession
which
does
owing
to
a
twist
that
the
superficial
self
which
is
candid
gives
it
seem
to
bear
any
relation
to
the
suppressed
wish
a
man
who
really
wants
to
leave
his
wife
develops
a
hatred
for
pickled
cabbage
which
may
find
vent
in
performances
that
lead
straight
to
the
asylum
but
that
all
technical
he
finished
bluffly
my
business
to
understand
it
not
yours
the
point
is
obsession
is
that
he
ca
remember
the
latter
years
of
his
life
well
his
winking
blue
eyes
drew
us
all
into
a
community
we
hardly
felt
what
the
suppressed
wish
of
which
it
the
manifestation
he
wished
for
nothing
said
kitty
he
was
fond
of
us
and
he
had
a
lot
of
money
ah
but
he
did
countered
the
doctor
gleefully
he
seemed
to
be
enjoying
it
all
quite
obviously
he
has
forgotten
his
life
here
because
he
is
discontented
with
it
what
clearer
proof
could
you
need
than
the
fact
you
were
just
telling
me
when
these
ladies
came
in
that
the
reason
the
war
office
did
wire
to
you
when
he
was
wounded
was
that
he
had
forgotten
to
register
his
address
do
you
see
what
that
means
forgetfulness
shrugged
kitty
he
is
businesslike
she
had
always
nourished
a
doubt
as
to
whether
chris
was
really
as
she
put
it
practical
and
his
income
and
his
international
reputation
weighed
nothing
as
against
his
evident
inability
to
pick
up
pieces
at
sales
one
forgets
only
those
things
that
one
wants
to
forget
it
our
business
to
find
out
why
he
wanted
to
forget
this
life
he
can
remember
quite
well
when
he
is
hypnotized
she
said
obstructively
she
had
quite
ceased
to
glow
oh
hypnotism
a
silly
trick
it
releases
the
memory
of
a
dissociated
personality
which
ca
be
related
not
possibly
in
such
an
obstinate
case
as
this
to
the
waking
personality
i
do
it
by
talking
to
him
getting
him
to
tell
his
dreams
he
beamed
at
the
prospect
but
you
it
would
be
such
a
help
if
you
would
give
me
any
clue
to
this
discontent
i
tell
you
said
kitty
he
was
not
discontented
till
he
went
mad
he
caught
the
glint
of
her
rising
temper
ah
he
said
madness
is
an
indictment
not
of
the
people
one
lives
with
only
of
the
high
gods
if
there
was
anything
it
evident
that
it
was
not
your
fault
a
smile
sugared
it
and
knowing
that
where
he
had
to
flatter
his
dissecting
hand
had
not
an
easy
task
he
turned
to
me
whose
general
appearance
suggests
that
flattery
is
not
part
of
my
daily
diet
you
miss
baldry
you
known
him
longest
nothing
and
everything
was
wrong
i
said
at
last
i
always
felt
it
a
sharp
movement
of
kitty
body
confirmed
my
deep
old
suspicion
that
she
hated
me
he
went
back
further
than
i
expected
his
relations
with
his
father
and
mother
now
his
father
was
old
when
he
was
born
and
always
was
a
little
jealous
of
him
his
mother
was
not
his
sort
she
wanted
a
stupid
son
who
would
have
been
satisfied
with
shooting
he
laid
down
a
remark
very
softly
like
a
hunter
setting
a
snare
he
turned
then
to
sex
with
a
peculiar
need
it
was
margaret
who
spoke
shuffling
her
feet
awkwardly
under
her
chair
yes
he
was
always
dependent
we
gaped
at
her
who
said
this
of
our
splendid
chris
and
i
saw
that
she
was
not
as
she
had
been
there
was
a
directness
of
speech
a
straight
stare
that
was
for
her
a
frenzy
doctor
she
said
her
mild
voice
roughened
what
the
use
of
talking
you
ca
cure
him
she
caught
her
lower
lip
with
her
teeth
and
fought
back
from
the
brink
of
tears
make
him
happy
i
mean
all
you
can
do
is
to
make
him
ordinary
i
grant
you
that
all
i
do
he
said
it
queerly
seemed
as
though
he
was
experiencing
the
relief
one
feels
on
meeting
an
intellectual
equal
it
my
profession
to
bring
people
from
various
outlying
districts
of
the
mind
to
the
normal
there
seems
to
be
a
general
feeling
it
the
place
where
they
ought
to
be
sometimes
i
do
see
the
urgency
myself
she
continued
without
joy
i
know
how
you
could
bring
him
back
a
memory
so
strong
that
it
would
recall
everything
else
in
spite
of
his
discontent
the
little
man
had
lost
in
a
moment
his
glib
assurance
his
knowingness
about
the
pathways
of
the
soul
well
i
willing
to
learn
remind
him
of
the
boy
said
margaret
the
doctor
ceased
suddenly
to
balance
on
the
balls
of
his
feet
what
boy
they
had
a
boy
he
looked
at
kitty
you
told
me
nothing
of
this
i
did
think
it
mattered
she
answered
and
shivered
and
looked
cold
as
she
always
did
at
the
memory
of
her
unique
contact
with
death
he
died
five
years
ago
he
dropped
his
head
back
stared
at
the
cornice
and
said
with
the
soft
malignity
of
a
clever
person
dealing
with
the
these
subtle
discontents
are
often
the
most
difficult
to
deal
with
sharply
he
turned
to
margaret
how
would
you
remind
him
take
him
something
the
boy
wore
some
toy
he
played
with
their
eyes
met
wisely
it
would
have
to
be
you
that
did
it
her
face
assented
kitty
said
i
do
understand
how
does
it
matter
so
much
she
repeated
it
twice
before
she
broke
the
silence
that
margaret
wisdom
had
brought
down
on
us
then
anderson
rattling
the
keys
in
his
and
swelling
red
and
perturbed
answered
i
do
know
but
it
does
kitty
voice
soared
in
satisfaction
oh
then
it
very
simple
grey
can
do
it
now
jenny
take
grey
up
to
the
nursery
there
are
lots
of
things
up
there
margaret
made
no
movement
but
continued
to
sit
with
her
heavy
boots
resting
on
the
edge
of
their
soles
anderson
searched
kitty
face
exclaimed
oh
well
and
flung
himself
into
an
so
suddenly
that
the
springs
spoke
margaret
smiled
at
that
and
turned
to
me
yes
take
me
to
the
nursery
please
yet
as
i
walked
beside
her
up
the
stairs
i
knew
this
compliance
was
not
the
indication
of
any
melting
of
this
new
steely
sternness
the
very
breathing
that
i
heard
as
i
knelt
beside
her
at
the
nursery
door
and
eased
the
disused
lock
seemed
to
come
from
a
different
and
a
harsher
body
than
had
been
hers
before
i
did
not
wonder
that
she
was
feeling
bleak
since
in
a
few
moments
she
was
to
go
out
and
say
the
words
that
would
end
all
her
happiness
that
would
destroy
all
the
gifts
her
generosity
had
so
difficultly
amassed
well
that
is
the
kind
of
thing
one
has
to
do
in
this
life
but
hardly
had
the
door
opened
and
disclosed
the
empty
sunny
spaces
swimming
with
motes
before
her
old
sweetness
flowered
again
she
moved
forward
slowly
tremulous
and
responsive
and
pleased
as
though
the
room
loveliness
was
a
gift
to
her
she
stretched
out
her
hands
to
the
clear
sapphire
walls
and
the
bright
fresco
of
birds
and
animals
with
a
young
delight
so
i
thought
might
a
bride
go
about
the
house
her
husband
secretly
prepared
for
her
yet
when
she
reached
the
hearth
and
stood
with
her
hands
behind
her
on
the
fireguard
looking
about
her
at
all
the
exquisite
devices
of
our
nursery
to
rivet
health
and
amusement
on
our
reluctant
little
visitor
it
was
so
apparent
that
she
was
a
mother
that
i
could
not
imagine
how
it
was
that
i
had
not
always
known
it
it
has
sometimes
happened
that
painters
who
have
kept
close
enough
to
earth
to
see
a
heavenly
vision
have
made
pictures
of
the
assumption
of
the
blessed
virgin
which
do
indeed
show
women
who
could
bring
god
into
the
world
by
the
passion
of
their
motherhood
let
there
be
life
their
suspended
bodies
seem
to
cry
out
to
the
universe
about
them
and
the
very
clouds
under
their
feet
change
into
cherubim
as
margaret
stood
there
her
hands
pressed
palm
to
palm
beneath
her
chin
and
a
blind
smile
on
her
face
she
looked
even
so
oh
the
fine
room
she
cried
but
where
his
little
cot
it
is
here
this
is
the
day
nursery
the
night
nursery
we
keep
it
is
just
bedroom
now
her
eyes
shone
at
the
thought
of
the
cockered
childhood
this
had
been
i
could
afford
to
have
two
nurseries
it
makes
all
the
difference
to
the
wee
things
she
hung
above
me
for
a
little
as
i
opened
the
ottoman
and
rummaged
among
oliver
clothes
ah
the
lovely
little
frocks
did
she
make
them
ah
well
she
hardly
have
the
time
with
this
great
house
to
see
to
but
i
do
care
much
for
baby
frocks
the
babies
themselves
are
none
the
happier
for
them
it
all
show
she
went
over
to
the
and
gave
a
ghostly
child
a
ride
for
long
she
hummed
a
tuneless
song
into
the
sunshine
and
retreated
far
away
into
some
maternal
dream
he
was
too
young
for
this
she
said
his
daddy
must
have
given
him
it
i
knew
it
men
always
give
them
presents
above
their
age
they
in
such
a
hurry
for
them
to
grow
up
we
like
them
to
take
their
time
the
loves
but
where
his
engine
did
he
love
of
course
he
never
saw
them
you
so
far
from
the
railway
station
what
a
pity
he
have
loved
them
so
dick
was
so
happy
when
i
stopped
his
pram
on
the
on
my
way
back
from
the
shops
and
he
could
sit
up
and
see
the
puffers
going
by
her
distress
that
oliver
had
missed
this
humble
pleasure
darkened
her
for
a
minute
why
did
he
die
you
did
overtax
his
brain
he
was
taught
his
letters
too
soon
oh
no
i
said
i
could
find
the
clothes
i
wanted
the
only
thing
that
taxed
his
little
brain
was
the
prayers
his
scotch
nurse
taught
him
and
he
did
bother
much
over
them
he
would
say
tender
leopard
instead
of
tender
shepherd
as
if
he
liked
it
better
did
you
ever
the
things
they
say
he
a
scotch
nurse
they
say
they
very
good
i
read
in
the
papers
the
queen
of
spain
has
one
she
had
gone
back
to
the
hearth
again
and
was
playing
with
the
toys
on
the
mantelpiece
it
was
odd
that
she
showed
no
interest
in
my
search
for
the
most
memorable
garment
a
vivacity
which
played
above
her
strength
like
a
ball
of
elmo
fire
on
the
mast
of
a
stout
ship
made
me
realize
she
still
was
strange
the
toys
he
had
his
nurse
did
let
him
have
them
all
at
once
she
held
him
up
and
said
you
must
choose
and
he
said
please
nanny
and
wagged
his
head
at
every
word
i
had
laid
my
hand
on
them
at
last
i
wished
in
the
strangest
way
that
i
had
not
yet
of
course
it
had
to
be
that
just
what
he
did
do
i
said
as
she
felt
the
fine
of
the
clockwork
dog
her
face
began
to
twitch
i
thought
perhaps
my
baby
had
left
me
because
i
had
so
little
to
give
him
but
if
a
baby
could
leave
all
this
she
cried
flatly
as
though
constant
repetition
in
the
night
had
made
it
as
instinctive
a
reaction
to
suffering
as
a
moan
i
want
a
child
i
want
a
child
her
arms
invoked
the
wasted
life
that
had
been
squandered
in
this
room
it
all
gone
so
wrong
she
fretted
and
her
voice
dropped
to
a
solemn
whisper
they
each
had
only
half
a
life
i
had
to
steady
her
she
could
not
go
to
chris
and
shock
him
not
only
by
her
news
but
also
by
her
agony
i
rose
and
took
her
the
things
i
had
found
in
the
ottoman
and
the
toy
cupboard
i
think
these
are
the
best
things
to
take
this
is
one
of
the
blue
jerseys
he
used
to
wear
this
is
the
red
ball
he
and
his
father
used
to
play
with
on
the
lawn
her
hard
hunger
for
the
child
that
was
not
melted
into
a
tenderness
for
the
child
that
had
been
she
looked
broodingly
at
what
i
carried
then
laid
a
kind
hand
on
my
arm
you
chosen
the
very
things
he
will
remember
oh
you
poor
girl
i
found
that
from
her
i
could
accept
even
pity
she
nursed
the
jersey
and
the
ball
changed
them
from
arm
to
arm
and
held
them
to
her
face
i
think
i
know
the
kind
of
boy
he
was
a
man
from
the
first
she
kissed
them
folded
up
the
jersey
and
neatly
set
the
ball
upon
it
on
the
ottoman
and
regarded
them
with
tears
there
put
them
back
all
i
wanted
them
for
all
i
came
up
here
for
i
stared
to
get
chris
boy
she
moaned
you
thought
i
meant
to
take
them
out
to
chris
she
wrung
her
hands
her
weak
voice
quavered
at
the
sternness
of
her
resolution
how
can
i
i
grasped
her
hands
why
should
you
bring
him
back
i
said
i
might
have
known
there
was
deliverance
in
her
yet
her
slow
mind
gathered
speed
either
i
never
should
have
come
she
pleaded
or
you
should
let
him
be
she
was
arguing
not
with
me
but
with
the
whole
hostile
reasonable
world
mind
you
i
was
sure
if
i
ought
to
come
the
second
time
seeing
we
both
were
married
and
that
i
prayed
and
read
the
bible
but
i
could
get
any
help
you
do
notice
how
little
there
is
in
the
bible
really
till
you
go
to
it
for
help
but
i
lived
a
hard
life
and
i
always
done
my
best
for
william
and
i
know
nothing
in
the
world
matters
so
much
as
happiness
if
anybody
happy
you
ought
to
let
them
be
so
i
came
again
let
him
be
if
you
knew
how
happy
he
was
just
pottering
round
the
garden
men
do
love
a
garden
he
could
just
go
on
it
can
go
on
so
easily
but
there
was
a
shade
of
doubt
in
her
voice
she
was
pleading
not
only
with
me
but
with
fate
you
would
let
them
take
him
away
to
the
asylum
you
would
stop
me
coming
the
other
one
might
but
you
see
she
did
oh
do
just
let
him
be
put
it
like
this
she
made
such
explanatory
gestures
as
i
have
seen
cabmen
make
over
their
saucers
of
tea
round
a
shelter
if
my
boy
had
been
a
cripple
he
was
he
had
the
loveliest
limbs
and
the
doctors
had
said
to
me
straighten
your
boy
legs
for
you
but
he
will
be
in
pain
all
the
rest
of
his
life
i
not
have
let
them
touch
him
i
seemed
to
have
to
tell
them
that
i
knew
a
way
i
suppose
it
would
have
been
sly
to
sit
there
and
not
tell
them
i
told
them
anyhow
but
oh
i
ca
do
it
go
out
and
put
an
end
to
the
poor
love
happiness
after
the
time
he
had
the
war
and
all
and
then
he
have
to
go
back
there
i
ca
i
ca
illustration
i
ought
to
do
it
ought
i
i
felt
an
ecstatic
sense
of
ease
everything
was
going
to
be
right
chris
was
to
live
in
the
interminable
enjoyment
of
his
youth
and
love
there
was
to
be
a
finality
about
his
happiness
which
usually
belongs
only
to
loss
and
calamity
he
was
to
be
as
happy
as
a
ring
cast
into
the
sea
is
lost
as
a
man
whose
coffin
has
lain
for
centuries
beneath
the
sod
is
dead
yet
margaret
continued
to
say
and
irritated
me
by
the
implication
that
the
matter
was
not
settled
i
ought
to
do
it
ought
i
of
course
not
of
course
not
i
cried
heartily
but
the
attention
died
in
her
eyes
she
stared
over
my
shoulder
at
the
open
door
where
kitty
stood
the
poise
of
her
head
had
lost
its
pride
the
shadows
under
her
eyes
were
black
like
the
marks
of
blows
and
all
her
loveliness
was
diverted
to
the
expression
of
grief
she
held
in
her
arms
her
chinese
sleeve
dog
a
pet
that
had
fallen
from
favor
and
was
now
only
to
be
met
whining
upward
for
a
little
love
at
every
passer
in
the
corridors
and
it
sprawled
across
her
white
frock
wriggling
for
joy
at
the
unaccustomed
embrace
that
she
should
at
last
have
stooped
to
lift
the
lonely
little
dog
was
a
sign
of
her
deep
unhappiness
why
she
had
come
up
i
do
not
know
nor
why
her
face
puckered
with
tears
as
she
looked
in
on
us
it
was
not
that
she
had
the
slightest
intimation
of
our
decision
for
she
could
not
have
conceived
that
we
could
follow
any
course
but
that
which
was
obviously
to
her
advantage
it
was
simply
that
she
hated
to
see
this
strange
ugly
woman
moving
about
among
her
things
she
swallowed
her
tears
and
passed
on
to
drift
like
a
dog
about
the
corridors
now
why
did
kitty
who
was
the
falsest
thing
on
earth
who
was
in
tune
with
every
kind
of
falsity
by
merely
suffering
somehow
remind
us
of
reality
why
did
her
tears
reveal
to
me
what
i
had
learned
long
ago
but
had
forgotten
in
my
frenzied
love
that
there
is
a
draft
that
we
must
drink
or
not
be
fully
human
i
knew
that
one
must
know
the
truth
i
knew
quite
well
that
when
one
is
adult
one
must
raise
to
one
lips
the
wine
of
the
truth
heedless
that
it
is
not
sweet
like
milk
but
draws
the
mouth
with
its
strength
and
celebrate
communion
with
reality
or
else
walk
forever
queer
and
small
like
a
dwarf
thirst
for
this
sacrament
had
made
chris
strike
away
the
cup
of
lies
about
life
that
kitty
white
hands
held
to
him
and
turn
to
margaret
with
this
vast
trustful
gesture
of
his
loss
of
memory
and
helped
by
me
she
had
forgotten
that
it
is
the
first
concern
of
love
to
safeguard
the
dignity
of
the
beloved
so
that
neither
god
in
his
skies
nor
the
boy
peering
through
the
hedge
should
find
in
all
time
one
possibility
for
contempt
and
had
handed
him
the
trivial
toy
of
happiness
we
had
been
utterly
negligent
of
his
future
blasphemously
careless
of
the
divine
essential
of
his
soul
for
if
we
left
him
in
his
magic
circle
there
would
come
a
time
when
his
delusion
turned
to
a
senile
idiocy
when
his
joy
at
the
sight
of
margaret
disgusted
the
flesh
because
his
smiling
mouth
was
slack
with
age
when
one
eyes
no
longer
followed
him
caressingly
as
he
went
down
to
look
for
the
first
primroses
in
the
wood
but
flitted
here
and
there
defensively
to
see
that
nobody
was
noticing
the
doddering
old
man
gamekeepers
would
chat
kindly
with
him
and
tap
their
foreheads
as
they
passed
through
the
copse
callers
would
be
tactful
and
dangle
bright
talk
before
him
he
who
was
as
a
flag
flying
from
our
tower
would
become
a
patch
of
eccentricity
on
the
the
music
of
his
being
would
become
a
witless
piping
in
the
bushes
he
would
not
be
quite
a
man
i
did
not
know
how
i
could
pierce
margaret
simplicity
with
this
last
cruel
subtlety
and
turned
to
her
stammering
but
she
said
give
me
the
jersey
and
the
ball
the
rebellion
had
gone
from
her
eyes
and
they
were
again
the
seat
of
all
gentle
wisdom
the
truth
the
truth
she
said
and
he
must
know
it
i
looked
up
at
her
gasping
yet
not
truly
amazed
for
i
had
always
known
she
could
not
leave
her
throne
of
righteousness
for
long
and
she
repeated
the
truth
the
truth
smiling
sadly
at
the
strange
order
of
this
earth
we
kissed
not
as
women
but
as
lovers
do
i
think
we
each
embraced
that
part
of
chris
the
other
had
absorbed
by
her
love
she
took
the
jersey
and
the
ball
and
clasped
them
as
though
they
were
a
child
when
she
got
to
the
door
she
stopped
and
leaned
against
the
lintel
her
head
fell
back
her
eyes
closed
her
mouth
was
contorted
as
though
she
swallowed
bitter
drink
i
lay
face
downward
on
the
ottoman
and
presently
heard
her
poor
boots
go
creaking
down
the
corridors
through
the
feeling
of
doom
that
filled
the
room
as
tangibly
as
a
scent
i
stretched
out
to
the
thought
of
chris
in
the
deep
daze
of
devotion
which
followed
recollection
of
the
fair
down
on
his
cheek
the
skin
burned
brown
to
the
rim
of
his
gray
eyes
the
harsh
and
diffident
masculinity
of
him
i
found
comfort
in
remembering
that
there
was
a
physical
gallantry
about
him
which
would
still
even
when
the
worst
had
happened
leap
sometimes
to
the
joy
of
life
always
to
the
very
end
when
the
sun
shone
on
his
face
or
his
horse
took
his
fences
well
he
would
screw
up
his
eyes
and
smile
that
little
smile
i
nursed
a
feeble
glow
at
that
we
must
ride
a
lot
i
planned
and
then
kitty
heels
tapped
on
the
polished
floor
and
her
skirts
swished
as
she
sat
down
in
the
and
i
was
distressed
by
the
sense
more
tiresome
than
a
flickering
light
of
some
one
fretting
she
said
i
wish
she
would
hurry
up
she
got
to
do
it
sooner
or
later
my
spirit
was
asleep
in
horror
out
there
margaret
was
breaking
his
heart
and
hers
using
words
like
a
hammer
looking
wise
doing
it
so
well
are
they
coming
back
asked
kitty
i
wish
you
look
there
was
nothing
in
the
garden
only
a
column
of
birds
swinging
across
the
lake
of
green
light
that
lay
before
the
sunset
a
long
time
after
kitty
spoke
once
more
jenny
do
look
again
there
had
fallen
a
twilight
which
was
a
wistfulness
of
the
earth
under
the
i
dimly
saw
a
figure
mothering
something
in
her
arms
almost
had
she
dissolved
into
the
shadows
in
another
moment
the
night
would
have
her
with
his
back
turned
on
this
fading
unhappiness
chris
walked
across
the
lawn
he
was
looking
up
under
his
brows
at
the
house
as
though
it
were
a
hated
place
to
which
against
all
his
hopes
business
had
forced
him
to
return
he
stepped
aside
to
avoid
a
patch
of
brightness
cast
by
a
lighted
window
on
the
grass
lights
in
our
house
were
worse
than
darkness
affection
worse
than
hate
elsewhere
he
wore
a
dreadful
decent
smile
i
knew
how
his
voice
would
resolutely
lift
in
greeting
us
he
walked
not
like
a
boy
as
he
had
done
that
very
afternoon
but
with
the
soldier
hard
tread
upon
the
heel
it
recalled
to
me
that
bad
as
we
were
we
were
yet
not
the
worst
circumstance
of
his
return
when
we
had
lifted
the
yoke
of
our
embraces
from
his
shoulders
he
would
go
back
to
that
flooded
trench
in
flanders
under
that
sky
more
full
of
flying
death
than
clouds
to
that
where
bullets
fall
like
rain
on
the
rotting
faces
of
the
dead
jenny
are
they
there
kitty
asked
again
they
both
there
is
he
coming
back
he
coming
back
jenny
jenny
how
does
he
look
oh
how
could
i
say
it
every
inch
a
soldier
she
crept
behind
me
to
the
window
peered
over
my
shoulder
and
saw
i
heard
her
suck
in
her
breath
with
satisfaction
he
cured
she
whispered
slowly
he
cured
the
end
