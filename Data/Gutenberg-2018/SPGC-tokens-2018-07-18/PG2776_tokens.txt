tobin
and
me
the
two
of
us
went
down
to
coney
one
day
for
there
was
four
dollars
between
us
and
tobin
had
need
of
distractions
for
there
was
katie
mahorner
his
sweetheart
of
county
sligo
lost
since
she
started
for
america
three
months
before
with
two
hundred
dollars
her
own
savings
and
one
hundred
dollars
from
the
sale
of
tobin
inherited
estate
a
fine
cottage
and
pig
on
the
bog
shannaugh
and
since
the
letter
that
tobin
got
saying
that
she
had
started
to
come
to
him
not
a
bit
of
news
had
he
heard
or
seen
of
katie
mahorner
tobin
advertised
in
the
papers
but
nothing
could
be
found
of
the
colleen
so
to
coney
me
and
tobin
went
thinking
that
a
turn
at
the
chutes
and
the
smell
of
the
popcorn
might
raise
the
heart
in
his
bosom
but
tobin
was
a
hardheaded
man
and
the
sadness
stuck
in
his
skin
he
ground
his
teeth
at
the
crying
balloons
he
cursed
the
moving
pictures
and
though
he
would
drink
whenever
asked
he
scorned
punch
and
judy
and
was
for
licking
the
tintype
men
as
they
came
so
i
gets
him
down
a
side
way
on
a
board
walk
where
the
attractions
were
some
less
violent
at
a
little
six
by
eight
stall
tobin
halts
with
a
more
human
look
in
his
eye
is
here
says
he
i
will
be
diverted
i
have
the
palm
of
me
hand
investigated
by
the
wonderful
palmist
of
the
nile
and
see
if
what
is
to
be
will
be
tobin
was
a
believer
in
signs
and
the
unnatural
in
nature
he
possessed
illegal
convictions
in
his
mind
along
the
subjects
of
black
cats
lucky
numbers
and
the
weather
predictions
in
the
papers
we
went
into
the
enchanted
chicken
coop
which
was
fixed
mysterious
with
red
cloth
and
pictures
of
hands
with
lines
crossing
like
a
railroad
centre
the
sign
over
the
door
says
it
is
madame
zozo
the
egyptian
palmist
there
was
a
fat
woman
inside
in
a
red
jumper
with
pothooks
and
beasties
embroidered
upon
it
tobin
gives
her
ten
cents
and
extends
one
of
his
hands
she
lifts
tobin
hand
which
is
own
brother
to
the
hoof
of
a
drayhorse
and
examines
it
to
see
whether
is
a
stone
in
the
frog
or
a
cast
shoe
he
has
come
for
man
says
this
madame
zozo
the
line
of
your
fate
shows
tis
not
me
foot
at
all
says
tobin
interrupting
sure
is
no
beauty
but
ye
hold
the
palm
of
me
hand
the
line
shows
says
the
madame
that
ye
not
arrived
at
your
time
of
life
without
bad
luck
and
there
more
to
come
the
mount
of
venus
or
is
that
a
stone
bruise
shows
that
ye
been
in
love
there
been
trouble
in
your
life
on
account
of
your
sweetheart
is
katie
mahorner
she
has
references
with
whispers
tobin
to
me
in
a
loud
voice
to
one
side
i
see
says
the
palmist
a
great
deal
of
sorrow
and
tribulation
with
one
whom
ye
can
not
forget
i
see
the
lines
of
designation
point
to
the
letter
k
and
the
letter
m
in
her
name
whist
says
tobin
to
me
do
ye
hear
that
look
out
goes
on
the
palmist
for
a
dark
man
and
a
light
woman
for
they
both
bring
ye
trouble
ye
make
a
voyage
upon
the
water
very
soon
and
have
a
financial
loss
i
see
one
line
that
brings
good
luck
there
a
man
coming
into
your
life
who
will
fetch
ye
good
fortune
ye
know
him
when
ye
see
him
by
his
crooked
nose
is
his
name
set
down
asks
tobin
be
convenient
in
the
way
of
greeting
when
he
backs
up
to
dump
off
the
good
luck
his
name
says
the
palmist
thoughtful
looking
is
not
spelled
out
by
the
lines
but
they
indicate
is
a
long
one
and
the
letter
should
be
in
it
there
no
more
to
tell
do
block
up
the
door
is
wonderful
how
she
knows
says
tobin
as
we
walk
to
the
pier
as
we
squeezed
through
the
gates
a
nigger
man
sticks
his
lighted
segar
against
tobin
ear
and
there
is
trouble
tobin
hammers
his
neck
and
the
women
squeal
and
by
presence
of
mind
i
drag
the
little
man
out
of
the
way
before
the
police
comes
tobin
is
always
in
an
ugly
mood
when
enjoying
himself
on
the
boat
going
back
when
the
man
calls
who
wants
the
waiter
tobin
tried
to
plead
guilty
feeling
the
desire
to
blow
the
foam
off
a
crock
of
suds
but
when
he
felt
in
his
pocket
he
found
himself
discharged
for
lack
of
evidence
somebody
had
disturbed
his
change
during
the
commotion
so
we
sat
dry
upon
the
stools
listening
to
the
dagoes
fiddling
on
deck
if
anything
tobin
was
lower
in
spirits
and
less
congenial
with
his
misfortunes
than
when
we
started
on
a
seat
against
the
railing
was
a
young
woman
dressed
suitable
for
red
automobiles
with
hair
the
colour
of
an
unsmoked
meerschaum
in
passing
by
tobin
kicks
her
foot
without
intentions
and
being
polite
to
ladies
when
in
drink
he
tries
to
give
his
hat
a
twist
while
apologising
but
he
knocks
it
off
and
the
wind
carries
it
overboard
tobin
came
back
and
sat
down
and
i
began
to
look
out
for
him
for
the
man
adversities
were
becoming
frequent
he
was
apt
when
pushed
so
close
by
hard
luck
to
kick
the
best
dressed
man
he
could
see
and
try
to
take
command
of
the
boat
presently
tobin
grabs
my
arm
and
says
excited
jawn
says
he
do
ye
know
what
we
doing
we
taking
a
voyage
upon
the
water
there
now
says
i
subdue
yeself
the
boat
land
in
ten
minutes
more
look
says
he
at
the
light
lady
upon
the
bench
and
have
ye
forgotten
the
nigger
man
that
burned
me
ear
and
is
the
money
i
had
gone
a
dollar
it
was
i
thought
he
was
no
more
than
summing
up
his
catastrophes
so
as
to
get
violent
with
good
excuse
as
men
will
do
and
i
tried
to
make
him
understand
such
things
was
trifles
listen
says
tobin
ye
no
ear
for
the
gift
of
prophecy
or
the
miracles
of
the
inspired
what
did
the
palmist
lady
tell
ye
out
of
me
hand
is
coming
true
before
your
eyes
out
says
she
a
dark
man
and
a
light
woman
they
bring
ye
trouble
have
ye
forgot
the
nigger
man
though
he
got
some
of
it
back
from
me
fist
can
ye
show
me
a
lighter
woman
than
the
blonde
lady
that
was
the
cause
of
me
hat
falling
in
the
water
and
where
the
dollar
i
had
in
me
vest
when
we
left
the
shooting
gallery
the
way
tobin
put
it
it
did
seem
to
corroborate
the
art
of
prediction
though
it
looked
to
me
that
these
accidents
could
happen
to
any
one
at
coney
without
the
implication
of
palmistry
tobin
got
up
and
walked
around
on
deck
looking
close
at
the
passengers
out
of
his
little
red
eyes
i
asked
him
the
interpretation
of
his
movements
ye
never
know
what
tobin
has
in
his
mind
until
he
begins
to
carry
it
out
ye
should
know
says
he
i
working
out
the
salvation
promised
by
the
lines
in
me
palm
i
looking
for
the
man
that
to
bring
the
good
luck
is
all
that
will
save
us
jawn
did
ye
ever
see
a
gang
of
hellions
in
the
days
of
your
life
was
the
boat
and
we
landed
and
walked
through
street
tobin
being
without
his
hat
on
a
street
corner
standing
under
a
and
looking
over
the
elevated
road
at
the
moon
was
a
man
a
long
man
he
was
dressed
decent
with
a
segar
between
his
teeth
and
i
saw
that
his
nose
made
two
twists
from
bridge
to
end
like
the
wriggle
of
a
snake
tobin
saw
it
at
the
same
time
and
i
heard
him
breathe
hard
like
a
horse
when
you
take
the
saddle
off
he
went
straight
up
to
the
man
and
i
went
with
him
to
ye
tobin
says
to
the
man
the
man
takes
out
his
segar
and
passes
the
compliments
sociable
would
ye
hand
us
your
name
asks
tobin
and
let
us
look
at
the
size
of
it
it
may
be
our
duty
to
become
acquainted
with
ye
my
name
says
the
man
polite
is
friedenhausman
maximus
g
friedenhausman
is
the
right
length
says
tobin
do
you
spell
it
with
an
anywhere
down
the
stretch
of
it
i
do
not
says
the
man
ye
spell
it
with
an
inquires
tobin
turning
anxious
if
your
conscience
says
the
man
with
the
nose
is
indisposed
toward
foreign
idioms
ye
might
to
please
yourself
smuggle
the
letter
into
the
penultimate
syllable
is
well
says
tobin
ye
in
the
presence
of
jawn
malone
and
daniel
tobin
tis
highly
appreciated
says
the
man
with
a
bow
and
now
since
i
can
not
conceive
that
ye
would
hold
a
spelling
bee
upon
the
street
corner
will
ye
name
some
reasonable
excuse
for
being
at
large
by
the
two
signs
answers
tobin
trying
to
explain
which
ye
display
according
to
the
reading
of
the
egyptian
palmist
from
the
sole
of
me
hand
ye
been
nominated
to
offset
with
good
luck
the
lines
of
trouble
leading
to
the
nigger
man
and
the
blonde
lady
with
her
feet
crossed
in
the
boat
besides
the
financial
loss
of
a
dollar
all
so
far
fulfilled
according
to
hoyle
the
man
stopped
smoking
and
looked
at
me
have
ye
any
amendments
he
asks
to
offer
to
that
statement
or
are
ye
one
too
i
thought
by
the
looks
of
ye
ye
might
have
him
in
charge
none
says
i
to
him
except
that
as
one
horseshoe
resembles
another
so
are
ye
the
picture
of
good
luck
as
predicted
by
the
hand
of
me
friend
if
not
then
the
lines
of
danny
hand
may
have
been
crossed
i
do
know
there
two
of
ye
says
the
man
with
the
nose
looking
up
and
down
for
the
sight
of
a
policeman
i
enjoyed
your
company
immense
with
that
he
shoves
his
segar
in
his
mouth
and
moves
across
the
street
stepping
fast
but
tobin
sticks
close
to
one
side
of
him
and
me
at
the
other
what
says
he
stopping
on
the
opposite
sidewalk
and
pushing
back
his
hat
do
ye
follow
me
i
tell
ye
he
says
very
loud
i
proud
to
have
met
ye
but
it
is
my
desire
to
be
rid
of
ye
i
am
off
to
me
home
do
says
tobin
leaning
against
his
sleeve
do
be
off
to
your
home
and
i
will
sit
at
the
door
of
it
till
ye
come
out
in
the
morning
for
the
dependence
is
upon
ye
to
obviate
the
curse
of
the
nigger
man
and
the
blonde
lady
and
the
financial
loss
of
the
is
a
strange
hallucination
says
the
man
turning
to
me
as
a
more
reasonable
lunatic
had
ye
better
get
him
home
listen
man
says
i
to
him
daniel
tobin
is
as
sensible
as
he
ever
was
maybe
he
is
a
bit
deranged
on
account
of
having
drink
enough
to
disturb
but
not
enough
to
settle
his
wits
but
he
is
no
more
than
following
out
the
legitimate
path
of
his
superstitions
and
predicaments
which
i
will
explain
to
you
with
that
i
relates
the
facts
about
the
palmist
lady
and
how
the
finger
of
suspicion
points
to
him
as
an
instrument
of
good
fortune
now
understand
i
concludes
my
position
in
this
riot
i
am
the
friend
of
me
friend
tobin
according
to
me
interpretations
is
easy
to
be
a
friend
to
the
prosperous
for
it
pays
is
not
hard
to
be
a
friend
to
the
poor
for
ye
get
puffed
up
by
gratitude
and
have
your
picture
printed
standing
in
front
of
a
tenement
with
a
scuttle
of
coal
and
an
orphan
in
each
hand
but
it
strains
the
art
of
friendship
to
be
true
friend
to
a
born
fool
and
that
what
doing
says
i
for
in
my
opinion
there
no
fortune
to
be
read
from
the
palm
of
me
hand
that
was
printed
there
with
the
handle
of
a
pick
and
though
ye
got
the
crookedest
nose
in
new
york
city
i
misdoubt
that
all
the
doing
business
could
milk
good
luck
from
ye
but
the
lines
of
danny
hand
pointed
to
ye
fair
and
i
assist
him
to
experiment
with
ye
until
he
convinced
ye
dry
after
that
the
man
turns
sudden
to
laughing
he
leans
against
a
corner
and
laughs
considerable
then
he
claps
me
and
tobin
on
the
backs
of
us
and
takes
us
by
an
arm
apiece
is
my
mistake
says
he
how
could
i
be
expecting
anything
so
fine
and
wonderful
to
be
turning
the
corner
upon
me
i
came
near
being
found
unworthy
hard
by
says
he
is
a
café
snug
and
suitable
for
the
entertainment
of
idiosyncrasies
let
us
go
there
and
have
drink
while
we
discuss
the
unavailability
of
the
categorical
so
saying
he
marched
me
and
tobin
to
the
back
room
of
a
saloon
and
ordered
the
drinks
and
laid
the
money
on
the
table
he
looks
at
me
and
tobin
like
brothers
of
his
and
we
have
the
segars
ye
must
know
says
the
man
of
destiny
that
me
walk
in
life
is
one
that
is
called
the
literary
i
wander
abroad
be
night
seeking
idiosyncrasies
in
the
masses
and
truth
in
the
heavens
above
when
ye
came
upon
me
i
was
in
contemplation
of
the
elevated
road
in
conjunction
with
the
chief
luminary
of
night
the
rapid
transit
is
poetry
and
art
the
moon
but
a
tedious
dry
body
moving
by
rote
but
these
are
private
opinions
for
in
the
business
of
literature
the
conditions
are
reversed
is
me
hope
to
be
writing
a
book
to
explain
the
strange
things
i
have
discovered
in
life
ye
will
put
me
in
a
book
says
tobin
disgusted
will
ye
put
me
in
a
book
i
will
not
says
the
man
for
the
covers
will
not
hold
ye
not
yet
the
best
i
can
do
is
to
enjoy
ye
meself
for
the
time
is
not
ripe
for
destroying
the
limitations
of
print
ye
would
look
fantastic
in
type
all
alone
by
meself
must
i
drink
this
cup
of
joy
but
i
thank
ye
boys
i
am
truly
grateful
the
talk
of
ye
says
tobin
blowing
through
his
moustache
and
pounding
the
table
with
his
fist
is
an
eyesore
to
me
patience
there
was
good
luck
promised
out
of
the
crook
of
your
nose
but
ye
bear
fruit
like
the
bang
of
a
drum
ye
resemble
with
your
noise
of
books
the
wind
blowing
through
a
crack
sure
now
i
would
be
thinking
the
palm
of
me
hand
lied
but
for
the
coming
true
of
the
nigger
man
and
the
blonde
lady
and
whist
says
the
long
man
would
ye
be
led
astray
by
physiognomy
me
nose
will
do
what
it
can
within
bounds
let
us
have
these
glasses
filled
again
for
is
good
to
keep
idiosyncrasies
well
moistened
they
being
subject
to
deterioration
in
a
dry
moral
atmosphere
so
the
man
of
literature
makes
good
to
my
notion
for
he
pays
cheerful
for
everything
the
capital
of
me
and
tobin
being
exhausted
by
prediction
but
tobin
is
sore
and
drinks
quiet
with
the
red
showing
in
his
eye
by
and
by
we
moved
out
for
was
eleven
and
stands
a
bit
upon
the
sidewalk
and
then
the
man
says
he
must
be
going
home
and
invites
me
and
tobin
to
walk
that
way
we
arrives
on
a
side
street
two
blocks
away
where
there
is
a
stretch
of
brick
houses
with
high
stoops
and
iron
fences
the
man
stops
at
one
of
them
and
looks
up
at
the
top
windows
which
he
finds
dark
is
me
humble
dwelling
says
he
and
i
begin
to
perceive
by
the
signs
that
me
wife
has
retired
to
slumber
therefore
i
will
venture
a
bit
in
the
way
of
hospitality
is
me
wish
that
ye
enter
the
basement
room
where
we
dine
and
partake
of
a
reasonable
refreshment
there
will
be
some
fine
cold
fowl
and
cheese
and
a
bottle
or
two
of
ale
ye
will
be
welcome
to
enter
and
eat
for
i
am
indebted
to
ye
for
diversions
the
appetite
and
conscience
of
me
and
tobin
was
congenial
to
the
proposition
though
was
sticking
hard
in
danny
superstitions
to
think
that
a
few
drinks
and
a
cold
lunch
should
represent
the
good
fortune
promised
by
the
palm
of
his
hand
step
down
the
steps
says
the
man
with
the
crooked
nose
and
i
will
enter
by
the
door
above
and
let
ye
in
i
will
ask
the
new
girl
we
have
in
the
kitchen
says
he
to
make
ye
a
pot
of
coffee
to
drink
before
ye
go
is
fine
coffee
katie
mahorner
makes
for
a
green
girl
just
landed
three
months
step
in
says
the
man
and
i
send
her
down
to
ye
the
gift
of
the
magi
one
dollar
and
cents
that
was
all
and
sixty
cents
of
it
was
in
pennies
pennies
saved
one
and
two
at
a
time
by
bulldozing
the
grocer
and
the
vegetable
man
and
the
butcher
until
one
cheeks
burned
with
the
silent
imputation
of
parsimony
that
such
close
dealing
implied
three
times
della
counted
it
one
dollar
and
cents
and
the
next
day
would
be
christmas
there
was
clearly
nothing
to
do
but
flop
down
on
the
shabby
little
couch
and
howl
so
della
did
it
which
instigates
the
moral
reflection
that
life
is
made
up
of
sobs
sniffles
and
smiles
with
sniffles
predominating
while
the
mistress
of
the
home
is
gradually
subsiding
from
the
first
stage
to
the
second
take
a
look
at
the
home
a
furnished
flat
at
per
week
it
did
not
exactly
beggar
description
but
it
certainly
had
that
word
on
the
lookout
for
the
mendicancy
squad
in
the
vestibule
below
was
a
into
which
no
letter
would
go
and
an
electric
button
from
which
no
mortal
finger
could
coax
a
ring
also
appertaining
thereunto
was
a
card
bearing
the
name
james
dillingham
young
the
dillingham
had
been
flung
to
the
breeze
during
a
former
period
of
prosperity
when
its
possessor
was
being
paid
per
week
now
when
the
income
was
shrunk
to
the
letters
of
dillingham
looked
blurred
as
though
they
were
thinking
seriously
of
contracting
to
a
modest
and
unassuming
but
whenever
james
dillingham
young
came
home
and
reached
his
flat
above
he
was
called
jim
and
greatly
hugged
by
james
dillingham
young
already
introduced
to
you
as
della
which
is
all
very
good
della
finished
her
cry
and
attended
to
her
cheeks
with
the
powder
rag
she
stood
by
the
window
and
looked
out
dully
at
a
grey
cat
walking
a
grey
fence
in
a
grey
backyard
tomorrow
would
be
christmas
day
and
she
had
only
with
which
to
buy
jim
a
present
she
had
been
saving
every
penny
she
could
for
months
with
this
result
twenty
dollars
a
week
does
go
far
expenses
had
been
greater
than
she
had
calculated
they
always
are
only
to
buy
a
present
for
jim
her
jim
many
a
happy
hour
she
had
spent
planning
for
something
nice
for
him
something
fine
and
rare
and
sterling
something
just
a
little
bit
near
to
being
worthy
of
the
honour
of
being
owned
by
jim
there
was
a
between
the
windows
of
the
room
perhaps
you
have
seen
a
in
an
flat
a
very
thin
and
very
agile
person
may
by
observing
his
reflection
in
a
rapid
sequence
of
longitudinal
strips
obtain
a
fairly
accurate
conception
of
his
looks
della
being
slender
had
mastered
the
art
suddenly
she
whirled
from
the
window
and
stood
before
the
glass
her
eyes
were
shining
brilliantly
but
her
face
had
lost
its
colour
within
twenty
seconds
rapidly
she
pulled
down
her
hair
and
let
it
fall
to
its
full
length
now
there
were
two
possessions
of
the
james
dillingham
youngs
in
which
they
both
took
a
mighty
pride
one
was
jim
gold
watch
that
had
been
his
father
and
his
grandfather
the
other
was
della
hair
had
the
queen
of
sheba
lived
in
the
flat
across
the
airshaft
della
would
have
let
her
hair
hang
out
the
window
some
day
to
dry
just
to
depreciate
her
majesty
jewels
and
gifts
had
king
solomon
been
the
janitor
with
all
his
treasures
piled
up
in
the
basement
jim
would
have
pulled
out
his
watch
every
time
he
passed
just
to
see
him
pluck
at
his
beard
from
envy
so
now
della
beautiful
hair
fell
about
her
rippling
and
shining
like
a
cascade
of
brown
waters
it
reached
below
her
knee
and
made
itself
almost
a
garment
for
her
and
then
she
did
it
up
again
nervously
and
quickly
once
she
faltered
for
a
minute
and
stood
still
while
a
tear
or
two
splashed
on
the
worn
red
carpet
on
went
her
old
brown
jacket
on
went
her
old
brown
hat
with
a
whirl
of
skirts
and
with
the
brilliant
sparkle
still
in
her
eyes
she
fluttered
out
the
door
and
down
the
stairs
to
the
street
where
she
stopped
the
sign
read
mme
sofronie
hair
goods
of
all
kinds
one
flight
up
della
ran
and
collected
herself
panting
madame
large
too
white
chilly
hardly
looked
the
sofronie
will
you
buy
my
hair
asked
della
i
buy
hair
said
madame
take
yer
hat
off
and
let
have
a
sight
at
the
looks
of
it
down
rippled
the
brown
cascade
twenty
dollars
said
madame
lifting
the
mass
with
a
practised
hand
give
it
to
me
quick
said
della
oh
and
the
next
two
hours
tripped
by
on
rosy
wings
forget
the
hashed
metaphor
she
was
ransacking
the
stores
for
jim
present
she
found
it
at
last
it
surely
had
been
made
for
jim
and
no
one
else
there
was
no
other
like
it
in
any
of
the
stores
and
she
had
turned
all
of
them
inside
out
it
was
a
platinum
fob
chain
simple
and
chaste
in
design
properly
proclaiming
its
value
by
substance
alone
and
not
by
meretricious
ornamentation
as
all
good
things
should
do
it
was
even
worthy
of
the
watch
as
soon
as
she
saw
it
she
knew
that
it
must
be
jim
it
was
like
him
quietness
and
value
the
description
applied
to
both
dollars
they
took
from
her
for
it
and
she
hurried
home
with
the
cents
with
that
chain
on
his
watch
jim
might
be
properly
anxious
about
the
time
in
any
company
grand
as
the
watch
was
he
sometimes
looked
at
it
on
the
sly
on
account
of
the
old
leather
strap
that
he
used
in
place
of
a
chain
when
della
reached
home
her
intoxication
gave
way
a
little
to
prudence
and
reason
she
got
out
her
curling
irons
and
lighted
the
gas
and
went
to
work
repairing
the
ravages
made
by
generosity
added
to
love
which
is
always
a
tremendous
task
dear
friends
a
mammoth
task
within
forty
minutes
her
head
was
covered
with
tiny
curls
that
made
her
look
wonderfully
like
a
truant
schoolboy
she
looked
at
her
reflection
in
the
mirror
long
carefully
and
critically
if
jim
does
kill
me
she
said
to
herself
before
he
takes
a
second
look
at
me
he
say
i
look
like
a
coney
island
chorus
girl
but
what
could
i
do
oh
what
could
i
do
with
a
dollar
and
cents
at
the
coffee
was
made
and
the
was
on
the
back
of
the
stove
hot
and
ready
to
cook
the
chops
jim
was
never
late
della
doubled
the
fob
chain
in
her
hand
and
sat
on
the
corner
of
the
table
near
the
door
that
he
always
entered
then
she
heard
his
step
on
the
stair
away
down
on
the
first
flight
and
she
turned
white
for
just
a
moment
she
had
a
habit
for
saying
little
silent
prayers
about
the
simplest
everyday
things
and
now
she
whispered
please
god
make
him
think
i
am
still
pretty
the
door
opened
and
jim
stepped
in
and
closed
it
he
looked
thin
and
very
serious
poor
fellow
he
was
only
and
to
be
burdened
with
a
family
he
needed
a
new
overcoat
and
he
was
without
gloves
jim
stopped
inside
the
door
as
immovable
as
a
setter
at
the
scent
of
quail
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
della
and
there
was
an
expression
in
them
that
she
could
not
read
and
it
terrified
her
it
was
not
anger
nor
surprise
nor
disapproval
nor
horror
nor
any
of
the
sentiments
that
she
had
been
prepared
for
he
simply
stared
at
her
fixedly
with
that
peculiar
expression
on
his
face
della
wriggled
off
the
table
and
went
for
him
jim
darling
she
cried
do
look
at
me
that
way
i
had
my
hair
cut
off
and
sold
because
i
could
have
lived
through
christmas
without
giving
you
a
present
it
grow
out
again
you
wo
mind
will
you
i
just
had
to
do
it
my
hair
grows
awfully
fast
say
christmas
jim
and
let
be
happy
you
do
know
what
a
nice
what
a
beautiful
nice
gift
i
got
for
you
you
cut
off
your
hair
asked
jim
laboriously
as
if
he
had
not
arrived
at
that
patent
fact
yet
even
after
the
hardest
mental
labor
cut
it
off
and
sold
it
said
della
do
you
like
me
just
as
well
anyhow
i
me
without
my
hair
ai
i
jim
looked
about
the
room
curiously
you
say
your
hair
is
gone
he
said
with
an
air
almost
of
idiocy
you
need
look
for
it
said
della
it
sold
i
tell
you
sold
and
gone
too
it
christmas
eve
boy
be
good
to
me
for
it
went
for
you
maybe
the
hairs
of
my
head
were
numbered
she
went
on
with
sudden
serious
sweetness
but
nobody
could
ever
count
my
love
for
you
shall
i
put
the
chops
on
jim
out
of
his
trance
jim
seemed
quickly
to
wake
he
enfolded
his
della
for
ten
seconds
let
us
regard
with
discreet
scrutiny
some
inconsequential
object
in
the
other
direction
eight
dollars
a
week
or
a
million
a
year
what
is
the
difference
a
mathematician
or
a
wit
would
give
you
the
wrong
answer
the
magi
brought
valuable
gifts
but
that
was
not
among
them
this
dark
assertion
will
be
illuminated
later
on
jim
drew
a
package
from
his
overcoat
pocket
and
threw
it
upon
the
table
do
make
any
mistake
dell
he
said
about
me
i
do
think
there
anything
in
the
way
of
a
haircut
or
a
shave
or
a
shampoo
that
could
make
me
like
my
girl
any
less
but
if
you
unwrap
that
package
you
may
see
why
you
had
me
going
a
while
at
first
white
fingers
and
nimble
tore
at
the
string
and
paper
and
then
an
ecstatic
scream
of
joy
and
then
alas
a
quick
feminine
change
to
hysterical
tears
and
wails
necessitating
the
immediate
employment
of
all
the
comforting
powers
of
the
lord
of
the
flat
for
there
lay
the
combs
the
set
of
combs
side
and
back
that
della
had
worshipped
long
in
a
broadway
window
beautiful
combs
pure
tortoise
shell
with
jewelled
rims
just
the
shade
to
wear
in
the
beautiful
vanished
hair
they
were
expensive
combs
she
knew
and
her
heart
had
simply
craved
and
yearned
over
them
without
the
least
hope
of
possession
and
now
they
were
hers
but
the
tresses
that
should
have
adorned
the
coveted
adornments
were
gone
but
she
hugged
them
to
her
bosom
and
at
length
she
was
able
to
look
up
with
dim
eyes
and
a
smile
and
say
my
hair
grows
so
fast
jim
and
then
della
leaped
up
like
a
little
singed
cat
and
cried
oh
oh
jim
had
not
yet
seen
his
beautiful
present
she
held
it
out
to
him
eagerly
upon
her
open
palm
the
dull
precious
metal
seemed
to
flash
with
a
reflection
of
her
bright
and
ardent
spirit
is
it
a
dandy
jim
i
hunted
all
over
town
to
find
it
you
have
to
look
at
the
time
a
hundred
times
a
day
now
give
me
your
watch
i
want
to
see
how
it
looks
on
it
instead
of
obeying
jim
tumbled
down
on
the
couch
and
put
his
hands
under
the
back
of
his
head
and
smiled
dell
said
he
let
put
our
christmas
presents
away
and
keep
a
while
they
too
nice
to
use
just
at
present
i
sold
the
watch
to
get
the
money
to
buy
your
combs
and
now
suppose
you
put
the
chops
on
the
magi
as
you
know
were
wise
men
wonderfully
wise
men
who
brought
gifts
to
the
babe
in
the
manger
they
invented
the
art
of
giving
christmas
presents
being
wise
their
gifts
were
no
doubt
wise
ones
possibly
bearing
the
privilege
of
exchange
in
case
of
duplication
and
here
i
have
lamely
related
to
you
the
uneventful
chronicle
of
two
foolish
children
in
a
flat
who
most
unwisely
sacrificed
for
each
other
the
greatest
treasures
of
their
house
but
in
a
last
word
to
the
wise
of
these
days
let
it
be
said
that
of
all
who
give
gifts
these
two
were
the
wisest
of
all
who
give
and
receive
gifts
such
as
they
are
wisest
everywhere
they
are
wisest
they
are
the
magi
a
cosmopolite
in
a
café
at
midnight
the
café
was
crowded
by
some
chance
the
little
table
at
which
i
sat
had
escaped
the
eye
of
incomers
and
two
vacant
chairs
at
it
extended
their
arms
with
venal
hospitality
to
the
influx
of
patrons
and
then
a
cosmopolite
sat
in
one
of
them
and
i
was
glad
for
i
held
a
theory
that
since
adam
no
true
citizen
of
the
world
has
existed
we
hear
of
them
and
we
see
foreign
labels
on
much
luggage
but
we
find
travellers
instead
of
cosmopolites
i
invoke
your
consideration
of
the
scene
the
tables
the
range
of
wall
seats
the
gay
company
the
ladies
dressed
in
toilets
speaking
in
an
exquisite
visible
chorus
of
taste
economy
opulence
or
art
the
sedulous
and
the
music
wisely
catering
to
all
with
its
raids
upon
the
composers
the
of
talk
and
laughter
and
if
you
will
the
würzburger
in
the
tall
glass
cones
that
bend
to
your
lips
as
a
ripe
cherry
sways
on
its
branch
to
the
beak
of
a
robber
jay
i
was
told
by
a
sculptor
from
mauch
chunk
that
the
scene
was
truly
parisian
my
cosmopolite
was
named
rushmore
coglan
and
he
will
be
heard
from
next
summer
at
coney
island
he
is
to
establish
a
new
attraction
there
he
informed
me
offering
kingly
diversion
and
then
his
conversation
rang
along
parallels
of
latitude
and
longitude
he
took
the
great
round
world
in
his
hand
so
to
speak
familiarly
contemptuously
and
it
seemed
no
larger
than
the
seed
of
a
maraschino
cherry
in
a
grape
fruit
he
spoke
disrespectfully
of
the
equator
he
skipped
from
continent
to
continent
he
derided
the
zones
he
mopped
up
the
high
seas
with
his
napkin
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
he
would
speak
of
a
certain
bazaar
in
hyderabad
whiff
he
would
have
you
on
skis
in
lapland
zip
now
you
rode
the
breakers
with
the
kanakas
at
kealaikahiki
presto
he
dragged
you
through
an
arkansas
swamp
let
you
dry
for
a
moment
on
the
alkali
plains
of
his
idaho
ranch
then
whirled
you
into
the
society
of
viennese
archdukes
anon
he
would
be
telling
you
of
a
cold
he
acquired
in
a
chicago
lake
breeze
and
how
old
escamila
cured
it
in
buenos
ayres
with
a
hot
infusion
of
the
weed
you
would
have
addressed
a
letter
to
rushmore
coglan
the
earth
solar
system
the
universe
and
have
mailed
it
feeling
confident
that
it
would
be
delivered
to
him
i
was
sure
that
i
had
found
at
last
the
one
true
cosmopolite
since
adam
and
i
listened
to
his
worldwide
discourse
fearful
lest
i
should
discover
in
it
the
local
note
of
the
mere
but
his
opinions
never
fluttered
or
drooped
he
was
as
impartial
to
cities
countries
and
continents
as
the
winds
or
gravitation
and
as
rushmore
coglan
prattled
of
this
little
planet
i
thought
with
glee
of
a
great
who
wrote
for
the
whole
world
and
dedicated
himself
to
bombay
in
a
poem
he
has
to
say
that
there
is
pride
and
rivalry
between
the
cities
of
the
earth
and
that
the
men
that
breed
from
them
they
traffic
up
and
down
but
cling
to
their
hem
as
a
child
to
the
mother
gown
and
whenever
they
walk
by
roaring
streets
unknown
they
remember
their
native
city
most
faithful
foolish
fond
making
her
name
their
bond
upon
their
bond
and
my
glee
was
roused
because
i
had
caught
kipling
napping
here
i
had
found
a
man
not
made
from
dust
one
who
had
no
narrow
boasts
of
birthplace
or
country
one
who
if
he
bragged
at
all
would
brag
of
his
whole
round
globe
against
the
martians
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
moon
expression
on
these
subjects
was
precipitated
from
rushmore
coglan
by
the
third
corner
to
our
table
while
coglan
was
describing
to
me
the
topography
along
the
siberian
railway
the
orchestra
glided
into
a
medley
the
concluding
air
was
dixie
and
as
the
exhilarating
notes
tumbled
forth
they
were
almost
overpowered
by
a
great
clapping
of
hands
from
almost
every
table
it
is
worth
a
paragraph
to
say
that
this
remarkable
scene
can
be
witnessed
every
evening
in
numerous
cafés
in
the
city
of
new
york
tons
of
brew
have
been
consumed
over
theories
to
account
for
it
some
have
conjectured
hastily
that
all
southerners
in
town
hie
themselves
to
cafés
at
nightfall
this
applause
of
the
rebel
air
in
a
northern
city
does
puzzle
a
little
but
it
is
not
insolvable
the
war
with
spain
many
years
generous
mint
and
watermelon
crops
a
few
winners
at
the
new
orleans
and
the
brilliant
banquets
given
by
the
indiana
and
kansas
citizens
who
compose
the
north
carolina
society
have
made
the
south
rather
a
fad
in
manhattan
your
manicure
will
lisp
softly
that
your
left
forefinger
reminds
her
so
much
of
a
gentleman
in
richmond
oh
certainly
but
many
a
lady
has
to
work
now
the
war
you
know
when
dixie
was
being
played
a
young
man
sprang
up
from
somewhere
with
a
mosby
guerrilla
yell
and
waved
frantically
his
hat
then
he
strayed
through
the
smoke
dropped
into
the
vacant
chair
at
our
table
and
pulled
out
cigarettes
the
evening
was
at
the
period
when
reserve
is
thawed
one
of
us
mentioned
three
würzburgers
to
the
waiter
the
young
man
acknowledged
his
inclusion
in
the
order
by
a
smile
and
a
nod
i
hastened
to
ask
him
a
question
because
i
wanted
to
try
out
a
theory
i
had
would
you
mind
telling
me
i
began
whether
you
are
from
the
fist
of
rushmore
coglan
banged
the
table
and
i
was
jarred
into
silence
excuse
me
said
he
but
that
a
question
i
never
like
to
hear
asked
what
does
it
matter
where
a
man
is
from
is
it
fair
to
judge
a
man
by
his
address
why
i
seen
kentuckians
who
hated
whiskey
virginians
who
were
descended
from
pocahontas
indianians
who
written
a
novel
mexicans
who
did
wear
velvet
trousers
with
silver
dollars
sewed
along
the
seams
funny
englishmen
spendthrift
yankees
southerners
westerners
and
new
yorkers
who
were
too
busy
to
stop
for
an
hour
on
the
street
to
watch
a
grocer
clerk
do
up
cranberries
in
paper
bags
let
a
man
be
a
man
and
do
handicap
him
with
the
label
of
any
section
pardon
me
i
said
but
my
curiosity
was
not
altogether
an
idle
one
i
know
the
south
and
when
the
band
plays
i
like
to
observe
i
have
formed
the
belief
that
the
man
who
applauds
that
air
with
special
violence
and
ostensible
sectional
loyalty
is
invariably
a
native
of
either
secaucus
or
the
district
between
murray
hill
lyceum
and
the
harlem
river
this
city
i
was
about
to
put
my
opinion
to
the
test
by
inquiring
of
this
gentleman
when
you
interrupted
with
your
own
larger
theory
i
must
confess
and
now
the
young
man
spoke
to
me
and
it
became
evident
that
his
mind
also
moved
along
its
own
set
of
grooves
i
should
like
to
be
a
periwinkle
said
he
mysteriously
on
the
top
of
a
valley
and
sing
this
was
clearly
too
obscure
so
i
turned
again
to
coglan
i
been
around
the
world
twelve
times
said
he
i
know
an
esquimau
in
upernavik
who
sends
to
cincinnati
for
his
neckties
and
i
saw
a
in
uruguay
who
won
a
prize
in
a
battle
creek
breakfast
food
puzzle
competition
i
pay
rent
on
a
room
in
cairo
egypt
and
another
in
yokohama
all
the
year
around
i
got
slippers
waiting
for
me
in
a
in
shanghai
and
i
do
have
to
tell
how
to
cook
my
eggs
in
rio
de
janeiro
or
seattle
it
a
mighty
little
old
world
what
the
use
of
bragging
about
being
from
the
north
or
the
south
or
the
old
manor
house
in
the
dale
or
euclid
avenue
cleveland
or
pike
peak
or
fairfax
county
or
hooligan
flats
or
any
place
it
be
a
better
world
when
we
quit
being
fools
about
some
mildewed
town
or
ten
acres
of
swampland
just
because
we
happened
to
be
born
there
you
seem
to
be
a
genuine
cosmopolite
i
said
admiringly
but
it
also
seems
that
you
would
decry
patriotism
a
relic
of
the
stone
age
declared
coglan
warmly
we
are
all
brothers
chinamen
englishmen
zulus
patagonians
and
the
people
in
the
bend
of
the
kaw
river
some
day
all
this
petty
pride
in
one
city
or
state
or
section
or
country
will
be
wiped
out
and
we
all
be
citizens
of
the
world
as
we
ought
to
be
but
while
you
are
wandering
in
foreign
lands
i
persisted
do
not
your
thoughts
revert
to
some
spot
some
dear
and
nary
a
spot
interrupted
coglan
flippantly
the
terrestrial
globular
planetary
hunk
of
matter
slightly
flattened
at
the
poles
and
known
as
the
earth
is
my
abode
i
met
a
good
many
citizens
of
this
country
abroad
i
seen
men
from
chicago
sit
in
a
gondola
in
venice
on
a
moonlight
night
and
brag
about
their
drainage
canal
i
seen
a
southerner
on
being
introduced
to
the
king
of
england
hand
that
monarch
without
batting
his
eyes
the
information
that
his
on
his
mother
side
was
related
by
marriage
to
the
perkinses
of
charleston
i
knew
a
new
yorker
who
was
kidnapped
for
ransom
by
some
afghanistan
bandits
his
people
sent
over
the
money
and
he
came
back
to
kabul
with
the
agent
the
natives
said
to
him
through
an
interpreter
not
so
slow
do
you
think
i
do
know
says
he
and
he
begins
to
tell
them
about
a
cab
driver
at
sixth
avenue
and
broadway
those
ideas
do
suit
me
i
not
tied
down
to
anything
that
is
miles
in
diameter
just
put
me
down
as
rushmore
coglan
citizen
of
the
terrestrial
sphere
my
cosmopolite
made
a
large
adieu
and
left
me
for
he
thought
he
saw
some
one
through
the
chatter
and
smoke
whom
he
knew
so
i
was
left
with
the
periwinkle
who
was
reduced
to
würzburger
without
further
ability
to
voice
his
aspirations
to
perch
melodious
upon
the
summit
of
a
valley
i
sat
reflecting
upon
my
evident
cosmopolite
and
wondering
how
the
poet
had
managed
to
miss
him
he
was
my
discovery
and
i
believed
in
him
how
was
it
the
men
that
breed
from
them
they
traffic
up
and
down
but
cling
to
their
cities
hem
as
a
child
to
the
mother
gown
not
so
rushmore
coglan
with
the
whole
world
for
his
my
meditations
were
interrupted
by
a
tremendous
noise
and
conflict
in
another
part
of
the
café
i
saw
above
the
heads
of
the
seated
patrons
rushmore
coglan
and
a
stranger
to
me
engaged
in
terrific
battle
they
fought
between
the
tables
like
titans
and
glasses
crashed
and
men
caught
their
hats
up
and
were
knocked
down
and
a
brunette
screamed
and
a
blonde
began
to
sing
teasing
my
cosmopolite
was
sustaining
the
pride
and
reputation
of
the
earth
when
the
waiters
closed
in
on
both
combatants
with
their
famous
flying
wedge
formation
and
bore
them
outside
still
resisting
i
called
mccarthy
one
of
the
french
and
asked
him
the
cause
of
the
conflict
the
man
with
the
red
tie
that
was
my
cosmopolite
said
he
got
hot
on
account
of
things
said
about
the
bum
sidewalks
and
water
supply
of
the
place
he
come
from
by
the
other
guy
why
said
i
bewildered
that
man
is
a
citizen
of
the
world
a
cosmopolite
he
originally
from
mattawamkeag
maine
he
said
continued
mccarthy
and
he
would
stand
for
no
knockin
the
place
between
rounds
the
may
moon
shone
bright
upon
the
private
of
murphy
by
reference
to
the
almanac
a
large
amount
of
territory
will
be
discovered
upon
which
its
rays
also
fell
spring
was
in
its
heydey
with
hay
fever
soon
to
follow
the
parks
were
green
with
new
leaves
and
buyers
for
the
western
and
southern
trade
flowers
and
agents
were
blowing
the
air
and
answers
to
lawson
were
growing
milder
fountains
and
pinochle
were
playing
everywhere
the
windows
of
murphy
were
open
a
group
of
boarders
were
seated
on
the
high
stoop
upon
round
flat
mats
like
german
pancakes
in
one
of
the
front
windows
mccaskey
awaited
her
husband
supper
was
cooling
on
the
table
its
heat
went
into
mccaskey
at
nine
mccaskey
came
he
carried
his
coat
on
his
arm
and
his
pipe
in
his
teeth
and
he
apologised
for
disturbing
the
boarders
on
the
steps
as
he
selected
spots
of
stone
between
them
on
which
to
set
his
size
width
ds
as
he
opened
the
door
of
his
room
he
received
a
surprise
instead
of
the
usual
or
for
him
to
dodge
came
only
words
mccaskey
reckoned
that
the
benign
may
moon
had
softened
the
breast
of
his
spouse
i
heard
ye
came
the
oral
substitutes
for
kitchenware
ye
can
apollygise
to
of
the
streets
for
settin
yer
unhandy
feet
on
the
tails
of
their
frocks
but
ye
walk
on
the
neck
of
yer
wife
the
length
of
a
without
so
much
as

and
sure

that
long
from

evenin
and
the

man
here
twice
for

said
mccaskey
dashing
his
coat
and
hat
upon
a
chair
the
noise
of
ye
is
an
insult
to
me
appetite
when
ye
run
down
politeness
ye
take
the
mortar
from
between
the
bricks
of
the
foundations
of

no
more
than
exercisin
the
acrimony
of
a

when
ye

the

and
see
to

food
mccaskey
arose
heavily
and
went
to
the
stove
there
was
something
in
her
manner
that
warned
mccaskey
when
the
corners
of
her
mouth
went
down
suddenly
like
a
barometer
it
usually
foretold
a
fall
of
crockery
and
tinware
pig
face
is
it
said
mccaskey
and
hurled
a
stewpan
full
of
bacon
and
turnips
at
her
lord
mccaskey
was
no
novice
at
repartee
he
knew
what
should
follow
the
entrée
on
the
table
was
a
roast
sirloin
of
pork
garnished
with
shamrocks
he
retorted
with
this
and
drew
the
appropriate
return
of
a
bread
pudding
in
an
earthen
dish
a
hunk
of
swiss
cheese
accurately
thrown
by
her
husband
struck
mccaskey
below
one
eye
when
she
replied
with
a
full
of
a
hot
black
liquid
the
battle
according
to
courses
should
have
ended
but
mccaskey
was
no
let
cheap
bohemians
consider
coffee
the
end
if
they
would
let
them
make
that
he
was
foxier
still
were
not
beyond
the
compass
of
his
experience
they
were
not
to
be
had
in
the
pension
murphy
but
their
equivalent
was
at
hand
triumphantly
he
sent
the
wash
basin
at
the
head
of
his
matrimonial
adversary
mccaskey
dodged
in
time
she
reached
for
a
flatiron
with
which
as
a
sort
of
cordial
she
hoped
to
bring
the
gastronomical
duel
to
a
close
but
a
loud
wailing
scream
downstairs
caused
both
her
and
mccaskey
to
pause
in
a
sort
of
involuntary
armistice
on
the
sidewalk
at
the
corner
of
the
house
policeman
cleary
was
standing
with
one
ear
upturned
listening
to
the
crash
of
household
utensils
is
jawn
mccaskey
and
his
missis
at
it
again
meditated
the
policeman
i
wonder
shall
i
go
up
and
stop
the
row
i
will
not
married
folks
they
are
and
few
pleasures
they
have
not
last
long
sure
they
have
to
borrow
more
dishes
to
keep
it
up
with
and
just
then
came
the
loud
scream
betokening
fear
or
dire
extremity
is
probably
the
cat
said
policeman
cleary
and
walked
hastily
in
the
other
direction
the
boarders
on
the
steps
were
fluttered
toomey
an
insurance
solicitor
by
birth
and
an
investigator
by
profession
went
inside
to
analyse
the
scream
he
returned
with
the
news
that
little
boy

lost
following

work
is
hard
to
keep
up
with
dates
but
i
looked
the
house
over
from
top
to
cellar
and
it
gone
he
is
oh
for
the
love
av
hiven
silent
grim
colossal
the
big
city
has
ever
stood
against
its
revilers
they
call
it
hard
as
iron
they
say
that
no
pulse
of
pity
beats
in
its
bosom
they
compare
its
streets
with
lonely
forests
and
deserts
of
lava
but
beneath
the
hard
crust
of
the
lobster
is
found
a
delectable
and
luscious
food
perhaps
a
different
simile
would
have
been
wiser
still
nobody
should
take
offence
we
would
call
no
one
a
lobster
without
good
and
sufficient
claws
no
calamity
so
touches
the
common
heart
of
humanity
as
does
the
straying
of
a
little
child
their
feet
are
so
uncertain
and
feeble
the
ways
are
so
steep
and
strange
major
griggs
hurried
down
to
the
corner
and
up
the
avenue
into
place
gim
me
a
he
said
to
the
servitor
have
seen
a
little
devil
of
a
lost
kid
around
here
anywhere
have
you
toomey
retained
miss
purdy
hand
on
the
steps
think
of
that
dear
little
babe
said
miss
purdy
lost
from
his
mother
side
perhaps
already
fallen
beneath
the
iron
hoofs
of
galloping
steeds
oh
is
it
dreadful
ai
that
right
agreed
toomey
squeezing
her
hand
say
i
start
out
and
help
look
for
um
perhaps
said
miss
purdy
you
should
but
oh
toomey
you
are
so
dashing
so
reckless
suppose
in
your
enthusiasm
some
accident
should
befall
you
then
what
old
man
denny
read
on
about
the
arbitration
agreement
with
one
finger
on
the
lines
in
the
second
floor
front
and
mccaskey
came
to
the
window
to
recover
their
second
wind
mccaskey
was
scooping
turnips
out
of
his
vest
with
a
crooked
forefinger
and
his
lady
was
wiping
an
eye
that
the
salt
of
the
roast
pork
had
not
benefited
they
heard
the
outcry
below
and
thrust
their
heads
out
of
the
window
is
little
mike
is
lost
said
mccaskey
in
a
hushed
voice
the
beautiful
little
angel
of
a
gossoon
the
bit
of
a
boy
mislaid
said
mccaskey
leaning
out
of
the
window
why
now
that
bad
enough
entirely
the
childer
they
be
different
if
was
a
woman
i
be
willin
for
they
leave
peace
behind
when
they
go
disregarding
the
thrust
mccaskey
caught
her
husband
arm
jawn
she
said
sentimentally
missis
murphy
little
bye
is
lost
is
a
great
city
for
losing
little
boys
six
years
old
he
was
jawn
the
same
age
our
little
bye
would
have
been
if
we
had
had
one
six
years
ago
we
never
did
said
mccaskey
lingering
with
the
fact
but
if
we
had
jawn
think
what
sorrow
would
be
in
our
hearts
this
night
with
our
little
phelan
run
away
and
stolen
in
the
city
nowheres
at
all
ye
talk
foolishness
said
mccaskey
is
pat
he
would
be
named
after
me
old
father
in
cantrim
ye
lie
said
mccaskey
without
anger
me
brother
was
worth
tin
dozen
mccaskeys
after
him
would
the
bye
be
named
she
leaned
over
the
and
looked
down
at
the
hurrying
and
bustle
below
jawn
said
mccaskey
softly
i
sorry
i
was
hasty
wid
ye
was
hasty
puddin
as
ye
say
said
her
husband
and
turnips
and
coffee
was
what
ye
could
call
a
quick
lunch
all
right
and
tell
no
lie
mccaskey
slipped
her
arm
inside
her
husband
and
took
his
rough
hand
in
hers
listen
at
the
cryin
of
poor
murphy
she
said
is
an
awful
thing
for
a
bit
of
a
bye
to
be
lost
in
this
great
big
city
if
was
our
little
phelan
jawn
i
be
breakin
me
heart
awkwardly
mccaskey
withdrew
his
hand
but
he
laid
it
around
the
nearing
shoulder
of
his
wife
is
foolishness
of
course
said
he
roughly
but
i
be
cut
up
some
meself
if
our
little
pat
was
kidnapped
or
anything
but
there
never
was
any
childer
for
us
sometimes
i
been
ugly
and
hard
with
ye
judy
forget
it
they
leaned
together
and
looked
down
at
the
being
acted
below
long
they
sat
thus
people
surged
along
the
sidewalk
crowding
questioning
filling
the
air
with
rumours
and
inconsequent
surmises
murphy
ploughed
back
and
forth
in
their
midst
like
a
soft
mountain
down
which
plunged
an
audible
cataract
of
tears
couriers
came
and
went
loud
voices
and
a
renewed
uproar
were
raised
in
front
of
the
what
up
now
judy
asked
mccaskey
is
missis
murphy
voice
said
mccaskey
harking
she
says
she
after
finding
little
mike
asleep
behind
the
roll
of
old
linoleum
under
the
bed
in
her
room
mccaskey
laughed
loudly
that
yer
phelan
he
shouted
sardonically
divil
a
bit
would
a
pat
have
done
that
trick
if
the
bye
we
never
had
is
strayed
and
stole
by
the
powers
call
him
phelan
and
see
him
hide
out
under
the
bed
like
a
mangy
pup
mccaskey
arose
heavily
and
went
toward
the
dish
closet
with
the
corners
of
her
mouth
drawn
down
policeman
cleary
came
back
around
the
corner
as
the
crowd
dispersed
surprised
he
upturned
an
ear
toward
the
mccaskey
apartment
where
the
crash
of
irons
and
chinaware
and
the
ring
of
hurled
kitchen
utensils
seemed
as
loud
as
before
policeman
cleary
took
out
his
timepiece
by
the
deported
snakes
he
exclaimed
jawn
mccaskey
and
his
lady
have
been
fightin
for
an
hour
and
a
quarter
by
the
watch
the
missis
could
give
him
forty
pounds
weight
strength
to
his
arm
policeman
cleary
strolled
back
around
the
corner
old
man
denny
folded
his
paper
and
hurried
up
the
steps
just
as
murphy
was
about
to
lock
the
door
for
the
night
the
skylight
room
first
parker
would
show
you
the
double
parlours
you
would
not
dare
to
interrupt
her
description
of
their
advantages
and
of
the
merits
of
the
gentleman
who
had
occupied
them
for
eight
years
then
you
would
manage
to
stammer
forth
the
confession
that
you
were
neither
a
doctor
nor
a
dentist
parker
manner
of
receiving
the
admission
was
such
that
you
could
never
afterward
entertain
the
same
feeling
toward
your
parents
who
had
neglected
to
train
you
up
in
one
of
the
professions
that
fitted
parker
parlours
next
you
ascended
one
flight
of
stairs
and
looked
at
the
at
convinced
by
her
manner
that
it
was
worth
the
that
toosenberry
always
paid
for
it
until
he
left
to
take
charge
of
his
brother
orange
plantation
in
florida
near
palm
beach
where
mcintyre
always
spent
the
winters
that
had
the
double
front
room
with
private
bath
you
managed
to
babble
that
you
wanted
something
still
cheaper
if
you
survived
parker
scorn
you
were
taken
to
look
at
skidder
large
hall
room
on
the
third
floor
skidder
room
was
not
vacant
he
wrote
plays
and
smoked
cigarettes
in
it
all
day
long
but
every
was
made
to
visit
his
room
to
admire
the
lambrequins
after
each
visit
skidder
from
the
fright
caused
by
possible
eviction
would
pay
something
on
his
rent
then
oh
then
if
you
still
stood
on
one
foot
with
your
hot
hand
clutching
the
three
moist
dollars
in
your
pocket
and
hoarsely
proclaimed
your
hideous
and
culpable
poverty
nevermore
would
parker
be
cicerone
of
yours
she
would
honk
loudly
the
word
clara
she
would
show
you
her
back
and
march
downstairs
then
clara
the
coloured
maid
would
escort
you
up
the
carpeted
ladder
that
served
for
the
fourth
flight
and
show
you
the
skylight
room
it
occupied
feet
of
floor
space
at
the
middle
of
the
hall
on
each
side
of
it
was
a
dark
lumber
closet
or
storeroom
in
it
was
an
iron
cot
a
washstand
and
a
chair
a
shelf
was
the
dresser
its
four
bare
walls
seemed
to
close
in
upon
you
like
the
sides
of
a
coffin
your
hand
crept
to
your
throat
you
gasped
you
looked
up
as
from
a
well
and
breathed
once
more
through
the
glass
of
the
little
skylight
you
saw
a
square
of
blue
infinity
two
dollars
suh
clara
would
say
in
her
tones
one
day
miss
leeson
came
hunting
for
a
room
she
carried
a
typewriter
made
to
be
lugged
around
by
a
much
larger
lady
she
was
a
very
little
girl
with
eyes
and
hair
that
had
kept
on
growing
after
she
had
stopped
and
that
always
looked
as
if
they
were
saying
goodness
me
why
you
keep
up
with
us
parker
showed
her
the
double
parlours
in
this
closet
she
said
one
could
keep
a
skeleton
or
anaesthetic
or
coal
but
i
am
neither
a
doctor
nor
a
dentist
said
miss
leeson
with
a
shiver
parker
gave
her
the
incredulous
pitying
sneering
icy
stare
that
she
kept
for
those
who
failed
to
qualify
as
doctors
or
dentists
and
led
the
way
to
the
second
floor
back
eight
dollars
said
miss
leeson
dear
me
i
not
hetty
if
i
do
look
green
i
just
a
poor
little
working
girl
show
me
something
higher
and
lower
skidder
jumped
and
strewed
the
floor
with
cigarette
stubs
at
the
rap
on
his
door
excuse
me
skidder
said
parker
with
her
demon
smile
at
his
pale
looks
i
did
know
you
were
in
i
asked
the
lady
to
have
a
look
at
your
lambrequins
they
too
lovely
for
anything
said
miss
leeson
smiling
in
exactly
the
way
the
angels
do
after
they
had
gone
skidder
got
very
busy
erasing
the
tall
heroine
from
his
latest
unproduced
play
and
inserting
a
small
roguish
one
with
heavy
bright
hair
and
vivacious
features
anna
held
jump
at
it
said
skidder
to
himself
putting
his
feet
up
against
the
lambrequins
and
disappearing
in
a
cloud
of
smoke
like
an
aerial
cuttlefish
presently
the
tocsin
call
of
clara
sounded
to
the
world
the
state
of
miss
leeson
purse
a
dark
goblin
seized
her
mounted
a
stygian
stairway
thrust
her
into
a
vault
with
a
glimmer
of
light
in
its
top
and
muttered
the
menacing
and
cabalistic
words
two
dollars
i
take
it
sighed
miss
leeson
sinking
down
upon
the
squeaky
iron
bed
every
day
miss
leeson
went
out
to
work
at
night
she
brought
home
papers
with
handwriting
on
them
and
made
copies
with
her
typewriter
sometimes
she
had
no
work
at
night
and
then
she
would
sit
on
the
steps
of
the
high
stoop
with
the
other
roomers
miss
leeson
was
not
intended
for
a
room
when
the
plans
were
drawn
for
her
creation
she
was
and
full
of
tender
whimsical
fancies
once
she
let
skidder
read
to
her
three
acts
of
his
great
unpublished
comedy
no
kid
or
the
heir
of
the
subway
there
was
rejoicing
among
the
gentlemen
roomers
whenever
miss
leeson
had
time
to
sit
on
the
steps
for
an
hour
or
two
but
miss
longnecker
the
tall
blonde
who
taught
in
a
public
school
and
said
well
really
to
everything
you
said
sat
on
the
top
step
and
sniffed
and
miss
dorn
who
shot
at
the
moving
ducks
at
coney
every
sunday
and
worked
in
a
department
store
sat
on
the
bottom
step
and
sniffed
miss
leeson
sat
on
the
middle
step
and
the
men
would
quickly
group
around
her
especially
skidder
who
had
cast
her
in
his
mind
for
the
star
part
in
a
private
romantic
unspoken
drama
in
real
life
and
especially
hoover
who
was
fat
flush
and
foolish
and
especially
very
young
evans
who
set
up
a
hollow
cough
to
induce
her
to
ask
him
to
leave
off
cigarettes
the
men
voted
her
the
funniest
and
jolliest
ever
but
the
sniffs
on
the
top
step
and
the
lower
step
were
implacable
i
pray
you
let
the
drama
halt
while
chorus
stalks
to
the
footlights
and
drops
an
epicedian
tear
upon
the
fatness
of
hoover
tune
the
pipes
to
the
tragedy
of
tallow
the
bane
of
bulk
the
calamity
of
corpulence
tried
out
falstaff
might
have
rendered
more
romance
to
the
ton
than
would
have
romeo
rickety
ribs
to
the
ounce
a
lover
may
sigh
but
he
must
not
puff
to
the
train
of
momus
are
the
fat
men
remanded
in
vain
beats
the
faithfullest
heart
above
a
belt
avaunt
hoover
hoover
flush
and
foolish
might
carry
off
helen
herself
hoover
flush
foolish
and
fat
is
meat
for
perdition
there
was
never
a
chance
for
you
hoover
as
parker
roomers
sat
thus
one
summer
evening
miss
leeson
looked
up
into
the
firmament
and
cried
with
her
little
gay
laugh
why
there
billy
jackson
i
can
see
him
from
down
here
too
all
looked
up
some
at
the
windows
of
skyscrapers
some
casting
about
for
an
airship
it
that
star
explained
miss
leeson
pointing
with
a
tiny
finger
not
the
big
one
that
twinkles
the
steady
blue
one
near
it
i
can
see
it
every
night
through
my
skylight
i
named
it
billy
jackson
well
really
said
miss
longnecker
i
did
know
you
were
an
astronomer
miss
leeson
oh
yes
said
the
small
star
gazer
i
know
as
much
as
any
of
them
about
the
style
of
sleeves
they
going
to
wear
next
fall
in
mars
well
really
said
miss
longnecker
the
star
you
refer
to
is
gamma
of
the
constellation
cassiopeia
it
is
nearly
of
the
second
magnitude
and
its
meridian
passage
is
oh
said
the
very
young
evans
i
think
billy
jackson
is
a
much
better
name
for
it
same
here
said
hoover
loudly
breathing
defiance
to
miss
longnecker
i
think
miss
leeson
has
just
as
much
right
to
name
stars
as
any
of
those
old
astrologers
had
well
really
said
miss
longnecker
i
wonder
whether
it
a
shooting
star
remarked
miss
dorn
i
hit
nine
ducks
and
a
rabbit
out
of
ten
in
the
gallery
at
coney
sunday
he
does
show
up
very
well
from
down
here
said
miss
leeson
you
ought
to
see
him
from
my
room
you
know
you
can
see
stars
even
in
the
daytime
from
the
bottom
of
a
well
at
night
my
room
is
like
the
shaft
of
a
coal
mine
and
it
makes
billy
jackson
look
like
the
big
diamond
pin
that
night
fastens
her
kimono
with
there
came
a
time
after
that
when
miss
leeson
brought
no
formidable
papers
home
to
copy
and
when
she
went
out
in
the
morning
instead
of
working
she
went
from
office
to
office
and
let
her
heart
melt
away
in
the
drip
of
cold
refusals
transmitted
through
insolent
office
boys
this
went
on
there
came
an
evening
when
she
wearily
climbed
parker
stoop
at
the
hour
when
she
always
returned
from
her
dinner
at
the
restaurant
but
she
had
had
no
dinner
as
she
stepped
into
the
hall
hoover
met
her
and
seized
his
chance
he
asked
her
to
marry
him
and
his
fatness
hovered
above
her
like
an
avalanche
she
dodged
and
caught
the
balustrade
he
tried
for
her
hand
and
she
raised
it
and
smote
him
weakly
in
the
face
step
by
step
she
went
up
dragging
herself
by
the
railing
she
passed
skidder
door
as
he
was
a
stage
direction
for
myrtle
delorme
miss
leeson
in
his
unaccepted
comedy
to
pirouette
across
stage
from
l
to
the
side
of
the
count
up
the
carpeted
ladder
she
crawled
at
last
and
opened
the
door
of
the
skylight
room
she
was
too
weak
to
light
the
lamp
or
to
undress
she
fell
upon
the
iron
cot
her
fragile
body
scarcely
hollowing
the
worn
springs
and
in
that
erebus
of
the
skylight
room
she
slowly
raised
her
heavy
eyelids
and
smiled
for
billy
jackson
was
shining
down
on
her
calm
and
bright
and
constant
through
the
skylight
there
was
no
world
about
her
she
was
sunk
in
a
pit
of
blackness
with
but
that
small
square
of
pallid
light
framing
the
star
that
she
had
so
whimsically
and
oh
so
ineffectually
named
miss
longnecker
must
be
right
it
was
gamma
of
the
constellation
cassiopeia
and
not
billy
jackson
and
yet
she
could
not
let
it
be
gamma
as
she
lay
on
her
back
she
tried
twice
to
raise
her
arm
the
third
time
she
got
two
thin
fingers
to
her
lips
and
blew
a
kiss
out
of
the
black
pit
to
billy
jackson
her
arm
fell
back
limply
billy
she
murmured
faintly
you
millions
of
miles
away
and
you
wo
even
twinkle
once
but
you
kept
where
i
could
see
you
most
of
the
time
up
there
when
there
was
anything
else
but
darkness
to
look
at
did
you
millions
of
miles
billy
jackson
clara
the
coloured
maid
found
the
door
locked
at
the
next
day
and
they
forced
it
open
vinegar
and
the
slapping
of
wrists
and
burnt
feathers
proving
of
no
avail
some
one
ran
to
for
an
ambulance
in
due
time
it
backed
up
to
the
door
with
much
and
the
capable
young
medico
in
his
white
linen
coat
ready
active
confident
with
his
smooth
face
half
debonair
half
grim
danced
up
the
steps
ambulance
call
to
he
said
briefly
what
the
trouble
oh
yes
doctor
sniffed
parker
as
though
her
trouble
that
there
should
be
trouble
in
the
house
was
the
greater
i
ca
think
what
can
be
the
matter
with
her
nothing
we
could
do
would
bring
her
to
it
a
young
woman
a
miss
elsie
yes
a
miss
elsie
leeson
never
before
in
my
house
what
room
cried
the
doctor
in
a
terrible
voice
to
which
parker
was
a
stranger
the
skylight
room
it
evidently
the
ambulance
doctor
was
familiar
with
the
location
of
skylight
rooms
he
was
gone
up
the
stairs
four
at
a
time
parker
followed
slowly
as
her
dignity
demanded
on
the
first
landing
she
met
him
coming
back
bearing
the
astronomer
in
his
arms
he
stopped
and
let
loose
the
practised
scalpel
of
his
tongue
not
loudly
gradually
parker
crumpled
as
a
stiff
garment
that
slips
down
from
a
nail
ever
afterward
there
remained
crumples
in
her
mind
and
body
sometimes
her
curious
roomers
would
ask
her
what
the
doctor
said
to
her
let
that
be
she
would
answer
if
i
can
get
forgiveness
for
having
heard
it
i
will
be
satisfied
the
ambulance
physician
strode
with
his
burden
through
the
pack
of
hounds
that
follow
the
curiosity
chase
and
even
they
fell
back
along
the
sidewalk
abashed
for
his
face
was
that
of
one
who
bears
his
own
dead
they
noticed
that
he
did
not
lay
down
upon
the
bed
prepared
for
it
in
the
ambulance
the
form
that
he
carried
and
all
that
he
said
was
drive
like
h
l
wilson
to
the
driver
that
is
all
is
it
a
story
in
the
next
morning
paper
i
saw
a
little
news
item
and
the
last
sentence
of
it
may
help
you
as
it
helped
me
to
weld
the
incidents
together
it
recounted
the
reception
into
bellevue
hospital
of
a
young
woman
who
had
been
removed
from
no
east
street
suffering
from
debility
induced
by
starvation
it
concluded
with
these
words
william
jackson
the
ambulance
physician
who
attended
the
case
says
the
patient
will
recover
a
service
of
love
when
one
loves
one
art
no
service
seems
too
hard
that
is
our
premise
this
story
shall
draw
a
conclusion
from
it
and
show
at
the
same
time
that
the
premise
is
incorrect
that
will
be
a
new
thing
in
logic
and
a
feat
in
somewhat
older
than
the
great
wall
of
china
joe
larrabee
came
out
of
the
flats
of
the
middle
west
pulsing
with
a
genius
for
pictorial
art
at
six
he
drew
a
picture
of
the
town
pump
with
a
prominent
citizen
passing
it
hastily
this
effort
was
framed
and
hung
in
the
drug
store
window
by
the
side
of
the
ear
of
corn
with
an
uneven
number
of
rows
at
twenty
he
left
for
new
york
with
a
flowing
necktie
and
a
capital
tied
up
somewhat
closer
delia
caruthers
did
things
in
six
octaves
so
promisingly
in
a
village
in
the
south
that
her
relatives
chipped
in
enough
in
her
chip
hat
for
her
to
go
north
and
finish
they
could
not
see
her
f
but
that
is
our
story
joe
and
delia
met
in
an
atelier
where
a
number
of
art
and
music
students
had
gathered
to
discuss
chiaroscuro
wagner
music
rembrandt
works
pictures
waldteufel
wall
paper
chopin
and
oolong
joe
and
delia
became
enamoured
one
of
the
other
or
each
of
the
other
as
you
please
and
in
a
short
time
were
married
for
see
above
when
one
loves
one
art
no
service
seems
too
hard
and
larrabee
began
housekeeping
in
a
flat
it
was
a
lonesome
flat
something
like
the
a
sharp
way
down
at
the
end
of
the
keyboard
and
they
were
happy
for
they
had
their
art
and
they
had
each
other
and
my
advice
to
the
rich
young
man
would
be
sell
all
thou
hast
and
give
it
to
the
poor
janitor
for
the
privilege
of
living
in
a
flat
with
your
art
and
your
delia
shall
indorse
my
dictum
that
theirs
is
the
only
true
happiness
if
a
home
is
happy
it
can
not
fit
too
close
let
the
dresser
collapse
and
become
a
billiard
table
let
the
mantel
turn
to
a
rowing
machine
the
escritoire
to
a
spare
bedchamber
the
washstand
to
an
upright
piano
let
the
four
walls
come
together
if
they
will
so
you
and
your
delia
are
between
but
if
home
be
the
other
kind
let
it
be
wide
and
long
enter
you
at
the
golden
gate
hang
your
hat
on
hatteras
your
cape
on
cape
horn
and
go
out
by
the
labrador
joe
was
painting
in
the
class
of
the
great
magister
you
know
his
fame
his
fees
are
high
his
lessons
are
light
his
have
brought
him
renown
delia
was
studying
under
rosenstock
you
know
his
repute
as
a
disturber
of
the
piano
keys
they
were
mighty
happy
as
long
as
their
money
lasted
so
is
every
but
i
will
not
be
cynical
their
aims
were
very
clear
and
defined
joe
was
to
become
capable
very
soon
of
turning
out
pictures
that
old
gentlemen
with
thin
and
thick
pocketbooks
would
sandbag
one
another
in
his
studio
for
the
privilege
of
buying
delia
was
to
become
familiar
and
then
contemptuous
with
music
so
that
when
she
saw
the
orchestra
seats
and
boxes
unsold
she
could
have
sore
throat
and
lobster
in
a
private
and
refuse
to
go
on
the
stage
but
the
best
in
my
opinion
was
the
home
life
in
the
little
flat
the
ardent
voluble
chats
after
the
day
study
the
cozy
dinners
and
fresh
light
breakfasts
the
interchange
of
ambitions
ambitions
interwoven
each
with
the
other
or
else
inconsiderable
the
mutual
help
and
inspiration
and
overlook
my
artlessness
stuffed
olives
and
cheese
sandwiches
at
but
after
a
while
art
flagged
it
sometimes
does
even
if
some
switchman
does
flag
it
everything
going
out
and
nothing
coming
in
as
the
vulgarians
say
money
was
lacking
to
pay
magister
and
herr
rosenstock
their
prices
when
one
loves
one
art
no
service
seems
too
hard
so
delia
said
she
must
give
music
lessons
to
keep
the
chafing
dish
bubbling
for
two
or
three
days
she
went
out
canvassing
for
pupils
one
evening
she
came
home
elated
joe
dear
she
said
gleefully
i
a
pupil
and
oh
the
loveliest
people
general
general
a
pinkney
daughter
on
street
such
a
splendid
house
joe
you
ought
to
see
the
front
door
byzantine
i
think
you
would
call
it
and
inside
oh
joe
i
never
saw
anything
like
it
before
my
pupil
is
his
daughter
clementina
i
dearly
love
her
already
a
delicate
thing
dresses
always
in
white
and
the
sweetest
simplest
manners
only
eighteen
years
old
i
to
give
three
lessons
a
week
and
just
think
joe
a
lesson
i
do
mind
it
a
bit
for
when
i
get
two
or
three
more
pupils
i
can
resume
my
lessons
with
herr
rosenstock
now
smooth
out
that
wrinkle
between
your
brows
dear
and
let
have
a
nice
supper
that
all
right
for
you
dele
said
joe
attacking
a
can
of
peas
with
a
carving
knife
and
a
hatchet
but
how
about
me
do
you
think
i
going
to
let
you
hustle
for
wages
while
i
philander
in
the
regions
of
high
art
not
by
the
bones
of
benvenuto
cellini
i
guess
i
can
sell
papers
or
lay
cobblestones
and
bring
in
a
dollar
or
two
delia
came
and
hung
about
his
neck
joe
dear
you
are
silly
you
must
keep
on
at
your
studies
it
is
not
as
if
i
had
quit
my
music
and
gone
to
work
at
something
else
while
i
teach
i
learn
i
am
always
with
my
music
and
we
can
live
as
happily
as
millionaires
on
a
week
you
must
think
of
leaving
mr
magister
all
right
said
joe
reaching
for
the
blue
scalloped
vegetable
dish
but
i
hate
for
you
to
be
giving
lessons
it
is
art
but
you
a
trump
and
a
dear
to
do
it
when
one
loves
one
art
no
service
seems
too
hard
said
delia
magister
praised
the
sky
in
that
sketch
i
made
in
the
park
said
joe
and
tinkle
gave
me
permission
to
hang
two
of
them
in
his
window
i
may
sell
one
if
the
right
kind
of
a
moneyed
idiot
sees
them
i
sure
you
will
said
delia
sweetly
and
now
let
be
thankful
for
pinkney
and
this
veal
roast
during
all
of
the
next
week
the
larrabees
had
an
early
breakfast
joe
was
enthusiastic
about
some
sketches
he
was
doing
in
central
park
and
delia
packed
him
off
breakfasted
coddled
praised
and
kissed
at
art
is
an
engaging
mistress
it
was
most
times
when
he
returned
in
the
evening
at
the
end
of
the
week
delia
sweetly
proud
but
languid
triumphantly
tossed
three
bills
on
the
inches
centre
table
of
the
feet
flat
parlour
sometimes
she
said
a
little
wearily
clementina
tries
me
afraid
she
does
practise
enough
and
i
have
to
tell
her
the
same
things
so
often
and
then
she
always
dresses
entirely
in
white
and
that
does
get
monotonous
but
pinkney
is
the
dearest
old
man
i
wish
you
could
know
him
joe
he
comes
in
sometimes
when
i
am
with
clementina
at
the
piano
he
is
a
widower
you
know
and
stands
there
pulling
his
white
goatee
how
are
the
semiquavers
and
the
demisemiquavers
progressing
he
always
asks
i
wish
you
could
see
the
wainscoting
in
that
joe
and
those
astrakhan
rug
portières
and
clementina
has
such
a
funny
little
cough
i
hope
she
is
stronger
than
she
looks
oh
i
really
am
getting
attached
to
her
she
is
so
gentle
and
high
bred
pinkney
brother
was
once
minister
to
bolivia
and
then
joe
with
the
air
of
a
monte
cristo
drew
forth
a
ten
a
five
a
two
and
a
one
all
legal
tender
notes
and
laid
them
beside
earnings
sold
that
watercolour
of
the
obelisk
to
a
man
from
peoria
he
announced
overwhelmingly
do
joke
with
me
said
delia
not
from
peoria
all
the
way
i
wish
you
could
see
him
dele
fat
man
with
a
woollen
muffler
and
a
quill
toothpick
he
saw
the
sketch
in
tinkle
window
and
thought
it
was
a
windmill
at
first
he
was
game
though
and
bought
it
anyhow
he
ordered
another
an
oil
sketch
of
the
lackawanna
freight
depot
to
take
back
with
him
music
lessons
oh
i
guess
art
is
still
in
it
i
so
glad
you
kept
on
said
delia
heartily
you
bound
to
win
dear
dollars
we
never
had
so
much
to
spend
before
we
have
oysters
and
filet
mignon
with
champignons
said
joe
where
is
the
olive
fork
on
the
next
saturday
evening
joe
reached
home
first
he
spread
his
on
the
parlour
table
and
washed
what
seemed
to
be
a
great
deal
of
dark
paint
from
his
hands
half
an
hour
later
delia
arrived
her
right
hand
tied
up
in
a
shapeless
bundle
of
wraps
and
bandages
how
is
this
asked
joe
after
the
usual
greetings
delia
laughed
but
not
very
joyously
clementina
she
explained
insisted
upon
a
welsh
rabbit
after
her
lesson
she
is
such
a
queer
girl
welsh
rabbits
at
in
the
afternoon
the
general
was
there
you
should
have
seen
him
run
for
the
chafing
dish
joe
just
as
if
there
was
a
servant
in
the
house
i
know
clementina
is
in
good
health
she
is
so
nervous
in
serving
the
rabbit
she
spilled
a
great
lot
of
it
boiling
hot
over
my
hand
and
wrist
it
hurt
awfully
joe
and
the
dear
girl
was
so
sorry
but
gen
pinkney
joe
that
old
man
nearly
went
distracted
he
rushed
downstairs
and
sent
somebody
they
said
the
furnace
man
or
somebody
in
the
basement
out
to
a
drug
store
for
some
oil
and
things
to
bind
it
up
with
it
does
hurt
so
much
now
what
this
asked
joe
taking
the
hand
tenderly
and
pulling
at
some
white
strands
beneath
the
bandages
it
something
soft
said
delia
that
had
oil
on
it
oh
joe
did
you
sell
another
sketch
she
had
seen
the
money
on
the
table
did
i
said
joe
just
ask
the
man
from
peoria
he
got
his
depot
and
he
is
sure
but
he
thinks
he
wants
another
parkscape
and
a
view
on
the
hudson
what
time
this
afternoon
did
you
burn
your
hand
dele
five
i
think
said
dele
plaintively
the
iron
i
mean
the
rabbit
came
off
the
fire
about
that
time
you
ought
to
have
seen
pinkney
joe
when
sit
down
here
a
moment
dele
said
joe
he
drew
her
to
the
couch
sat
beside
her
and
put
his
arm
across
her
shoulders
what
have
you
been
doing
for
the
last
two
weeks
dele
he
asked
she
braved
it
for
a
moment
or
two
with
an
eye
full
of
love
and
stubbornness
and
murmured
a
phrase
or
two
vaguely
of
pinkney
but
at
length
down
went
her
head
and
out
came
the
truth
and
tears
i
could
get
any
pupils
she
confessed
and
i
could
bear
to
have
you
give
up
your
lessons
and
i
got
a
place
ironing
shirts
in
that
big
street
laundry
and
i
think
i
did
very
well
to
make
up
both
general
pinkney
and
clementina
do
you
joe
and
when
a
girl
in
the
laundry
set
down
a
hot
iron
on
my
hand
this
afternoon
i
was
all
the
way
home
making
up
that
story
about
the
welsh
rabbit
you
not
angry
are
you
joe
and
if
i
had
got
the
work
you
might
have
sold
your
sketches
to
that
man
from
peoria
he
was
from
peoria
said
joe
slowly
well
it
does
matter
where
he
was
from
how
clever
you
are
joe
and
kiss
me
joe
and
what
made
you
ever
suspect
that
i
giving
music
lessons
to
clementina
i
did
said
joe
until
and
i
would
have
then
only
i
sent
up
this
cotton
waste
and
oil
from
the
this
afternoon
for
a
girl
upstairs
who
had
her
hand
burned
with
a
been
firing
the
engine
in
that
laundry
for
the
last
two
weeks
and
then
you
did
my
purchaser
from
peoria
said
joe
and
pinkney
are
both
creations
of
the
same
art
but
you
would
call
it
either
painting
or
music
and
then
they
both
laughed
and
joe
began
when
one
loves
one
art
no
service
seems
but
delia
stopped
him
with
her
hand
on
his
lips
no
she
said
just
one
loves
the
of
maggie
every
saturday
night
the
clover
leaf
social
club
gave
a
hop
in
the
hall
of
the
give
and
take
athletic
association
on
the
east
side
in
order
to
attend
one
of
these
dances
you
must
be
a
member
of
the
give
and
take
or
if
you
belong
to
the
division
that
starts
off
with
the
right
foot
in
waltzing
you
must
work
in
rhinegold
factory
still
any
clover
leaf
was
privileged
to
escort
or
be
escorted
by
an
outsider
to
a
single
dance
but
mostly
each
give
and
take
brought
the
girl
that
he
affected
and
few
strangers
could
boast
of
having
shaken
a
foot
at
the
regular
hops
maggie
toole
on
account
of
her
dull
eyes
broad
mouth
and
style
of
footwork
in
the
went
to
the
dances
with
anna
mccarty
and
her
fellow
anna
and
maggie
worked
side
by
side
in
the
factory
and
were
the
greatest
chums
ever
so
anna
always
made
jimmy
burns
take
her
by
maggie
house
every
saturday
night
so
that
her
friend
could
go
to
the
dance
with
them
the
give
and
take
athletic
association
lived
up
to
its
name
the
hall
of
the
association
in
orchard
street
was
fitted
out
with
inventions
with
the
fibres
thus
builded
up
the
members
were
wont
to
engage
the
police
and
rival
social
and
athletic
organisations
in
joyous
combat
between
these
more
serious
occupations
the
saturday
night
hop
with
the
factory
girls
came
as
a
refining
influence
and
as
an
efficient
screen
for
sometimes
the
tip
went
and
if
you
were
among
the
elect
that
tiptoed
up
the
dark
back
stairway
you
might
see
as
neat
and
satisfying
a
little
affair
to
a
finish
as
ever
happened
inside
the
ropes
on
saturdays
rhinegold
factory
closed
at
on
one
such
afternoon
anna
and
maggie
walked
homeward
together
at
maggie
door
anna
said
as
usual
be
ready
at
seven
sharp
mag
and
jimmy
and
come
by
for
you
but
what
was
this
instead
of
the
customary
humble
and
grateful
thanks
from
the
one
there
was
to
be
perceived
a
head
a
prideful
dimpling
at
the
corners
of
a
broad
mouth
and
almost
a
sparkle
in
a
dull
brown
eye
thanks
anna
said
maggie
but
you
and
jimmy
need
bother
i
a
gentleman
friend
that
coming
to
escort
me

and
beseeched

a
fellow
plain
dear
loyal
unattractive
maggie
so
sweet
as
a
chum
so
unsought
for
a
or
a
moonlit
bench
in
the
little
park
how
was
it
when
did
it
happen
who
was
it
you
see
said
maggie
flushed
with
the
wine
of
the
first
grapes
she
had
gathered
in
cupid
vineyard

right
two
inches
taller
than
jimmy
and
an
dresser
i
introduce
him
anna
just
as
soon
as
we
get
to
the
hall
anna
and
jimmy
were
among
the
first
clover
leafs
to
arrive
that
evening
anna
eyes
were
brightly
fixed
upon
the
door
of
the
hall
to
catch
the
first
glimpse
of
her
friend
catch
at
miss
toole
swept
into
the
hall
with
her
escort
quickly
her
triumphant
eye
discovered
her
chum
under
the
wing
of
her
faithful
jimmy

jimmy
you

what
i
mean
i
glad
for
mag
first
fellow
she
ever
had
oh
here
they
come
across
the
floor
maggie
sailed
like
a
coquettish
yacht
convoyed
by
a
stately
cruiser
and
truly
her
companion
justified
the
encomiums
of
the
faithful
chum
he
stood
two
inches
taller
than
the
average
give
and
take
athlete
his
dark
hair
curled
his
eyes
and
his
teeth
flashed
whenever
he
bestowed
his
frequent
smiles
the
young
men
of
the
clover
leaf
club
pinned
not
their
faith
to
the
graces
of
person
as
much
as
they
did
to
its
prowess
its
achievements
in
conflicts
and
its
preservation
from
the
legal
duress
that
constantly
menaced
it
the
member
of
the
association
who
would
bind
a
maiden
to
his
conquering
chariot
scorned
to
employ
beau
brummel
airs
they
were
not
considered
honourable
methods
of
warfare
the
swelling
biceps
the
coat
straining
at
its
buttons
over
the
chest
the
air
of
conscious
conviction
of
the
supereminence
of
the
male
in
the
cosmogony
of
creation
even
a
calm
display
of
bow
legs
as
subduing
and
enchanting
agents
in
the
gentle
tourneys
of
cupid
these
were
the
approved
arms
and
ammunition
of
the
clover
leaf
gallants
they
viewed
then
genuflexions
and
alluring
poses
of
this
visitor
with
their
chins
at
a
new
angle
a
friend
of
mine
terry
was
maggie
formula
of
introduction
she
led
him
around
the
room
presenting
him
to
each
clover
leaf
almost
was
she
pretty
now
with
the
unique
luminosity
in
her
eyes
that
comes
to
a
girl
with
her
first
suitor
and
a
kitten
with
its
first
mouse
maggie
toole
got
a
fellow
at
last
was
the
word
that
went
round
among
the
girls
pipe
mag
thus
the
give
and
takes
expressed
their
indifferent
contempt
usually
at
the
weekly
hops
maggie
kept
a
spot
on
the
wall
warm
with
her
back
she
felt
and
showed
so
much
gratitude
whenever
a
partner
invited
her
to
dance
that
his
pleasure
was
cheapened
and
diminished
she
had
even
grown
used
to
noticing
anna
joggle
the
reluctant
jimmy
with
her
elbow
as
a
signal
for
him
to
invite
her
chum
to
walk
over
his
feet
through
a
but
the
pumpkin
had
turned
to
a
coach
and
six
terry
was
a
victorious
prince
charming
and
maggie
toole
winged
her
first
butterfly
flight
and
though
our
tropes
of
fairyland
be
mixed
with
those
of
entomology
they
shall
not
spill
one
drop
of
ambrosia
from
the
melody
of
maggie
one
perfect
night
the
girls
besieged
her
for
introductions
to
her
fellow
the
clover
leaf
young
men
after
two
years
of
blindness
suddenly
perceived
charms
in
miss
toole
they
flexed
their
compelling
muscles
before
her
and
bespoke
her
for
the
dance
thus
she
scored
but
to
terry
the
honours
of
the
evening
fell
thick
and
fast
he
shook
his
curls
he
smiled
and
went
easily
through
the
seven
motions
for
acquiring
grace
in
your
own
room
before
an
open
window
ten
minutes
each
day
he
danced
like
a
faun
he
introduced
manner
and
style
and
atmosphere
his
words
came
trippingly
upon
his
tongue
and
he
waltzed
twice
in
succession
with
the
girl
that
dempsey
donovan
brought
dempsey
was
the
leader
of
the
association
he
wore
a
dress
suit
and
could
chin
the
bar
twice
with
one
hand
he
was
one
of
big
mike
lieutenants
and
was
never
troubled
by
trouble
no
cop
dared
to
arrest
him
whenever
he
broke
a
pushcart
man
head
or
shot
a
member
of
the
heinrick
sweeney
outing
and
literary
association
in
the
kneecap
an
officer
would
drop
around
and
say
the
like
to
see
ye
a
few
minutes
round
to
the
office
whin
ye
have
time
dempsey
me
boy
but
there
would
be
sundry
gentlemen
there
with
large
gold
fob
chains
and
black
cigars
and
somebody
would
tell
a
funny
story
and
then
dempsey
would
go
back
and
work
half
an
hour
with
the
dumbbells
so
doing
a
act
on
a
wire
stretched
across
niagara
was
a
safe
terpsichorean
performance
compared
with
waltzing
twice
with
dempsey
donovan
girl
at
the
jolly
round
face
of
big
mike
shone
at
the
door
for
five
minutes
upon
the
scene
he
always
looked
in
for
five
minutes
smiled
at
the
girls
and
handed
out
real
perfectos
to
the
delighted
boys
dempsey
donovan
was
at
his
elbow
instantly
talking
rapidly
big
mike
looked
carefully
at
the
dancers
smiled
shook
his
head
and
departed
the
music
stopped
the
dancers
scattered
to
the
chairs
along
the
walls
terry
with
his
entrancing
bow
relinquished
a
pretty
girl
in
blue
to
her
partner
and
started
back
to
find
maggie
dempsey
intercepted
him
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
some
fine
instinct
that
rome
must
have
bequeathed
to
us
caused
nearly
every
one
to
turn
and
look
at
them
there
was
a
subtle
feeling
that
two
gladiators
had
met
in
the
arena
two
or
three
give
and
takes
with
tight
coat
sleeves
drew
nearer
one
moment
said
dempsey
i
hope
you
enjoying
yourself
where
did
you
say
you
live
the
two
gladiators
were
well
matched
dempsey
had
perhaps
ten
pounds
of
weight
to
give
away
the
had
breadth
with
quickness
dempsey
had
a
glacial
eye
a
dominating
slit
of
a
mouth
an
indestructible
jaw
a
complexion
like
a
belle
and
the
coolness
of
a
champion
the
visitor
showed
more
fire
in
his
contempt
and
less
control
over
his
conspicuous
sneer
they
were
enemies
by
the
law
written
when
the
rocks
were
molten
they
were
each
too
splendid
too
mighty
too
incomparable
to
divide
one
only
must
survive
i
live
on
grand
said
insolently
and
no
trouble
to
find
me
at
home
where
do
you
live
dempsey
ignored
the
question
you
say
your
name
he
went
on
well
mike
says
he
never
saw
you
before
lots
of
things
he
never
saw
said
the
favourite
of
the
hop
as
a
rule
went
on
dempsey
huskily
sweet
in
this
district
know
one
another
you
escorted
one
of
our
lady
members
here
and
we
want
a
chance
to
make
good
if
you
got
a
family
tree
see
a
few
historical
buds
come
out
on
it
or
do
you
want
us
to
dig
it
out
of
you
by
the
roots
suppose
you
mind
your
own
business
suggested
blandly
dempsey
eye
brightened
he
held
up
an
inspired
forefinger
as
though
a
brilliant
idea
had
struck
him
i
got
it
now
he
said
cordially
it
was
just
a
little
mistake
you
ai
no
you
are
a
monkey
excuse
us
for
not
recognising
you
at
first
eye
flashed
he
made
a
quick
movement
but
andy
geoghan
was
ready
and
caught
his
arm
dempsey
nodded
at
andy
and
william
mcmahan
the
secretary
of
the
club
and
walked
rapidly
toward
a
door
at
the
rear
of
the
hall
two
other
members
of
the
give
and
take
association
swiftly
joined
the
little
group
terry
was
now
in
the
hands
of
the
board
of
rules
and
social
referees
they
spoke
to
him
briefly
and
softly
and
conducted
him
out
through
the
same
door
at
the
rear
this
movement
on
the
part
of
the
clover
leaf
members
requires
a
word
of
elucidation
back
of
the
association
hall
was
a
smaller
room
rented
by
the
club
in
this
room
personal
difficulties
that
arose
on
the
ballroom
floor
were
settled
man
to
man
with
the
weapons
of
nature
under
the
supervision
of
the
board
no
lady
could
say
that
she
had
witnessed
a
fight
at
a
clover
leaf
hop
in
several
years
its
gentlemen
members
guaranteed
that
so
easily
and
smoothly
had
dempsey
and
the
board
done
their
preliminary
work
that
many
in
the
hall
had
not
noticed
the
checking
of
the
fascinating
social
triumph
among
these
was
maggie
she
looked
about
for
her
escort
smoke
up
said
rose
cassidy
was
you
on
demps
donovan
picked
a
scrap
with
your
and
they
waltzed
out
to
the
slaughter
room
with
him
how
my
hair
look
done
up
this
way
mag
maggie
laid
a
hand
on
the
bosom
of
her
cheesecloth
waist
gone
to
fight
with
dempsey
she
said
breathlessly
they
got
to
be
stopped
dempsey
donovan
ca
fight
him
why
he
he
kill
him
ah
what
do
you
care
said
rosa
do
some
of
fight
every
hop
but
maggie
was
off
darting
her
way
through
the
maze
of
dancers
she
burst
through
the
rear
door
into
the
dark
hall
and
then
threw
her
solid
shoulder
against
the
door
of
the
room
of
single
combat
it
gave
way
and
in
the
instant
that
she
entered
her
eye
caught
the
scene
the
board
standing
about
with
open
watches
dempsey
donovan
in
his
shirt
sleeves
dancing
with
the
wary
grace
of
the
modern
pugilist
within
easy
reach
of
his
adversary
terry
standing
with
arms
folded
and
a
murderous
look
in
his
dark
eyes
and
without
slacking
the
speed
of
her
entrance
she
leaped
forward
with
a
scream
leaped
in
time
to
catch
and
hang
upon
the
arm
of
that
was
suddenly
uplifted
and
to
whisk
from
it
the
long
bright
stiletto
that
he
had
drawn
from
his
bosom
the
knife
fell
and
rang
upon
the
floor
cold
steel
drawn
in
the
rooms
of
the
give
and
take
association
such
a
thing
had
never
happened
before
every
one
stood
motionless
for
a
minute
andy
geoghan
kicked
the
stiletto
with
the
toe
of
his
shoe
curiously
like
an
antiquarian
who
has
come
upon
some
ancient
weapon
unknown
to
his
learning
and
then
hissed
something
unintelligible
between
his
teeth
dempsey
and
the
board
exchanged
looks
and
then
dempsey
looked
at
without
anger
as
one
looks
at
a
stray
dog
and
nodded
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
door
the
back
stairs
giuseppi
he
said
briefly
somebody
pitch
your
hat
down
after
you
maggie
walked
up
to
dempsey
donovan
there
was
a
brilliant
spot
of
red
in
her
cheeks
down
which
slow
tears
were
running
but
she
looked
him
bravely
in
the
eye
i
knew
it
dempsey
she
said
as
her
eyes
grew
dull
even
in
their
tears
i
knew
he
was
a
guinea
his
name
tony
spinelli
i
hurried
in
when
they
told
me
you
and
him
was
scrappin
them
guineas
always
carries
knives
but
you
do
understand
dempsey
i
never
had
a
fellow
in
my
life
i
got
tired
of
comin
with
anna
and
jimmy
every
night
so
i
fixed
it
with
him
to
call
himself
and
brought
him
along
i
knew
there
be
nothin
doin
for
him
if
he
came
as
a
dago
i
guess
resign
from
the
club
now
dempsey
turned
to
andy
geoghan
chuck
that
cheese
slicer
out
of
the
window
he
said
and
tell
inside
that
has
had
a
telephone
message
to
go
down
to
tammany
hall
and
then
he
turned
back
to
maggie
say
mag
he
said
i
see
you
home
and
how
about
next
saturday
night
will
you
come
to
the
hop
with
me
if
i
call
around
for
you
it
was
remarkable
how
quickly
maggie
eyes
could
change
from
dull
to
a
shining
brown
with
you
dempsey
she
stammered
say
will
a
duck
swim
man
about
town
there
were
two
or
three
things
that
i
wanted
to
know
i
do
not
care
about
a
mystery
so
i
began
to
inquire
it
took
me
two
weeks
to
find
out
what
women
carry
in
dress
suit
cases
and
then
i
began
to
ask
why
a
mattress
is
made
in
two
pieces
this
serious
query
was
at
first
received
with
suspicion
because
it
sounded
like
a
conundrum
i
was
at
last
assured
that
its
double
form
of
construction
was
designed
to
make
lighter
the
burden
of
woman
who
makes
up
beds
i
was
so
foolish
as
to
persist
begging
to
know
why
then
they
were
not
made
in
two
equal
pieces
whereupon
i
was
shunned
the
third
draught
that
i
craved
from
the
fount
of
knowledge
was
enlightenment
concerning
the
character
known
as
a
man
about
town
he
was
more
vague
in
my
mind
than
a
type
should
be
we
must
have
a
concrete
idea
of
anything
even
if
it
be
an
imaginary
idea
before
we
can
comprehend
it
now
i
have
a
mental
picture
of
john
doe
that
is
as
clear
as
a
steel
engraving
his
eyes
are
weak
blue
he
wears
a
brown
vest
and
a
shiny
black
serge
coat
he
stands
always
in
the
sunshine
chewing
something
and
he
keeps
his
pocket
knife
and
opening
it
again
with
his
thumb
and
if
the
man
higher
up
is
ever
found
take
my
assurance
for
it
he
will
be
a
large
pale
man
with
blue
wristlets
showing
under
his
cuffs
and
he
will
be
sitting
to
have
his
shoes
polished
within
sound
of
a
bowling
alley
and
there
will
be
somewhere
about
him
turquoises
but
the
canvas
of
my
imagination
when
it
came
to
limning
the
man
about
town
was
blank
i
fancied
that
he
had
a
detachable
sneer
like
the
smile
of
the
cheshire
cat
and
attached
cuffs
and
that
was
all
whereupon
i
asked
a
newspaper
reporter
about
him
why
said
he
a
about
town
something
between
a
and
a
he
is
exactly
well
he
fits
in
between
mrs
receptions
and
private
boxing
bouts
he
does
well
he
does
belong
either
to
the
lotos
club
or
to
the
jerry
mcgeogheghan
galvanised
iron
workers
apprentices
left
hook
chowder
association
i
do
exactly
know
how
to
describe
him
to
you
you
see
him
everywhere
anything
doing
yes
i
suppose
he
a
type
dress
clothes
every
evening
knows
the
ropes
calls
every
policeman
and
waiter
in
town
by
their
first
names
no
he
never
travels
with
the
hydrogen
derivatives
you
generally
see
him
alone
or
with
another
man
my
friend
the
reporter
left
me
and
i
wandered
further
afield
by
this
time
the
electric
lights
on
the
rialto
were
alight
people
passed
but
they
held
me
not
paphian
eyes
rayed
upon
me
and
left
me
unscathed
diners
heimgangers
confidence
men
panhandlers
actors
highwaymen
millionaires
and
outlanders
hurried
skipped
strolled
sneaked
swaggered
and
scurried
by
me
but
i
took
no
note
of
them
i
knew
them
all
i
had
read
their
hearts
they
had
served
i
wanted
my
man
about
town
he
was
a
type
and
to
drop
him
would
be
an
error
a
typograph
but
no
let
us
continue
let
us
continue
with
a
moral
digression
to
see
a
family
reading
the
sunday
paper
gratifies
the
sections
have
been
separated
papa
is
earnestly
scanning
the
page
that
pictures
the
young
lady
exercising
before
an
open
window
and
bending
but
there
there
mamma
is
interested
in
trying
to
guess
the
missing
letters
in
the
word
the
oldest
girls
are
eagerly
perusing
the
financial
reports
for
a
certain
young
man
remarked
last
sunday
night
that
he
had
taken
a
flyer
in

the
son
who
attends
the
new
york
public
school
is
absorbed
in
the
weekly
article
describing
how
to
make
over
an
old
skirt
for
he
hopes
to
take
a
prize
in
sewing
on

day
grandma
is
holding
to
the

supplement
with
a
grip
and
little

the

rocking
along
the
best
she
can
with
the
real

transfers
this
view
is
intended
to
be
reassuring
for
it
is
desirable
that
a
few
lines
of
this
story
be
skipped
for
it
introduces
strong
drink
i
went
into
a
café
to
and
while
it
was
being
mixed
i
asked
the
man
who
grabs
up
your
hot
scotch
spoon
as
soon
as
you
lay
it
down
what
he
understood
by
the
term
epithet
description
designation
characterisation
or
appellation
viz
a
man
about
town
why
said
he
carefully
it
means
a
fly
guy
that
wise
to
the
push
see
it
a
hot
sport
that
you
ca
bump
to
the
rail
anywhere
between
the
flatirons
see
i
guess
that
about
what
it
means
i
thanked
him
and
departed
on
the
sidewalk
a
salvation
lassie
shook
her
contribution
receptacle
gently
against
my
waistcoat
pocket
would
you
mind
telling
me
i
asked
her
if
you
ever
meet
with
the
character
commonly
denominated
as
man
about
town
during
your
daily
wanderings
i
think
i
know
whom
you
mean
she
answered
with
a
gentle
smile
we
see
them
in
the
same
places
night
after
night
they
are
the
devil
body
guard
and
if
the
soldiers
of
any
army
are
as
faithful
as
they
are
their
commanders
are
well
served
we
go
among
them
diverting
a
few
pennies
from
their
wickedness
to
the
lord
service
she
shook
the
box
again
and
i
dropped
a
dime
into
it
in
front
of
a
glittering
hotel
a
friend
of
mine
a
critic
was
climbing
from
a
cab
he
seemed
at
leisure
and
i
put
my
question
to
him
he
answered
me
conscientiously
as
i
was
sure
he
would
there
is
a
type
of
about
town
in
new
york
he
answered
the
term
is
quite
familiar
to
me
but
i
do
think
i
was
ever
called
upon
to
define
the
character
before
it
would
be
difficult
to
point
you
out
an
exact
specimen
i
would
say
offhand
that
it
is
a
man
who
had
a
hopeless
case
of
the
peculiar
new
york
disease
of
wanting
to
see
and
know
at
each
day
life
begins
with
him
he
follows
rigidly
the
conventions
of
dress
and
manners
but
in
the
business
of
poking
his
nose
into
places
where
he
does
not
belong
he
could
give
pointers
to
a
civet
cat
or
a
jackdaw
he
is
the
man
who
has
chased
bohemia
about
the
town
from
rathskeller
to
roof
garden
and
from
hester
street
to
harlem
until
you
ca
find
a
place
in
the
city
where
they
do
cut
their
spaghetti
with
a
knife
your
about
town
has
done
that
he
is
always
on
the
scent
of
something
new
he
is
curiosity
impudence
and
omnipresence
hansoms
were
made
for
him
and
cigars
and
the
curse
of
music
at
dinner
there
are
not
so
many
of
him
but
his
minority
report
is
adopted
everywhere
i
glad
you
brought
up
the
subject
i
felt
the
influence
of
this
nocturnal
blight
upon
our
city
but
i
never
thought
to
analyse
it
before
i
can
see
now
that
your
about
town
should
have
been
classified
long
ago
in
his
wake
spring
up
wine
agents
and
cloak
models
and
the
orchestra
plays
all
go
up
to
maud
for
him
by
request
instead
of
händel
he
makes
his
rounds
every
evening
while
you
and
i
see
the
elephant
once
a
week
when
the
cigar
store
is
raided
he
winks
at
the
officer
familiar
with
his
ground
and
walks
away
immune
while
you
and
i
search
among
the
presidents
for
names
and
among
the
stars
for
addresses
to
give
the
desk
sergeant
my
friend
the
critic
paused
to
acquire
breath
for
fresh
eloquence
i
seized
my
advantage
you
have
classified
him
i
cried
with
joy
you
have
painted
his
portrait
in
the
gallery
of
city
types
but
i
must
meet
one
face
to
face
i
must
study
the
man
about
town
at
first
hand
where
shall
i
find
him
how
shall
i
know
him
without
seeming
to
hear
me
the
critic
went
on
and
his
was
waiting
for
his
fare
too
he
is
the
sublimated
essence
of
the
refined
intrinsic
extract
of
rubber
the
concentrated
purified
irrefutable
unavoidable
spirit
of
curiosity
and
inquisitiveness
a
new
sensation
is
the
breath
in
his
nostrils
when
his
experience
is
exhausted
he
explores
new
fields
with
the
indefatigability
of
a
excuse
me
i
interrupted
but
can
you
produce
one
of
this
type
it
is
a
new
thing
to
me
i
must
study
it
i
will
search
the
town
over
until
i
find
one
its
habitat
must
be
here
on
broadway
i
am
about
to
dine
here
said
my
friend
come
inside
and
if
there
is
a
man
about
town
present
i
will
point
him
out
to
you
i
know
most
of
the
regular
patrons
here
i
am
not
dining
yet
i
said
to
him
you
will
excuse
me
i
am
going
to
find
my
man
about
town
this
night
if
i
have
to
rake
new
york
from
the
battery
to
little
coney
island
i
left
the
hotel
and
walked
down
broadway
the
pursuit
of
my
type
gave
a
pleasant
savour
of
life
and
interest
to
the
air
i
breathed
i
was
glad
to
be
in
a
city
so
great
so
complex
and
diversified
leisurely
and
with
something
of
an
air
i
strolled
along
with
my
heart
expanding
at
the
thought
that
i
was
a
citizen
of
great
gotham
a
sharer
in
its
magnificence
and
pleasures
a
partaker
in
its
glory
and
prestige
i
turned
to
cross
the
street
i
heard
something
buzz
like
a
bee
and
then
i
took
a
long
pleasant
ride
with
when
i
opened
my
eyes
i
remembered
a
smell
of
gasoline
and
i
said
aloud
has
it
passed
yet
a
hospital
nurse
laid
a
hand
that
was
not
particularly
soft
upon
my
brow
that
was
not
at
all
fevered
a
young
doctor
came
along
grinned
and
handed
me
a
morning
newspaper
want
to
see
how
it
happened
he
asked
cheerily
i
read
the
article
its
headlines
began
where
i
heard
the
buzzing
leave
off
the
night
before
it
closed
with
these
lines
bellevue
hospital
where
it
was
said
that
his
injuries
were
not
serious
he
appeared
to
be
a
typical
man
about
town
the
cop
and
the
anthem
on
his
bench
in
madison
square
soapy
moved
uneasily
when
wild
geese
honk
high
of
nights
and
when
women
without
sealskin
coats
grow
kind
to
their
husbands
and
when
soapy
moves
uneasily
on
his
bench
in
the
park
you
may
know
that
winter
is
near
at
hand
a
dead
leaf
fell
in
soapy
lap
that
was
jack
frost
card
jack
is
kind
to
the
regular
denizens
of
madison
square
and
gives
fair
warning
of
his
annual
call
at
the
corners
of
four
streets
he
hands
his
pasteboard
to
the
north
wind
footman
of
the
mansion
of
all
outdoors
so
that
the
inhabitants
thereof
may
make
ready
soapy
mind
became
cognisant
of
the
fact
that
the
time
had
come
for
him
to
resolve
himself
into
a
singular
committee
of
ways
and
means
to
provide
against
the
coming
rigour
and
therefore
he
moved
uneasily
on
his
bench
the
hibernatorial
ambitions
of
soapy
were
not
of
the
highest
in
them
there
were
no
considerations
of
mediterranean
cruises
of
soporific
southern
skies
drifting
in
the
vesuvian
bay
three
months
on
the
island
was
what
his
soul
craved
three
months
of
assured
board
and
bed
and
congenial
company
safe
from
boreas
and
bluecoats
seemed
to
soapy
the
essence
of
things
desirable
for
years
the
hospitable
blackwell
had
been
his
winter
quarters
just
as
his
more
fortunate
fellow
new
yorkers
had
bought
their
tickets
to
palm
beach
and
the
riviera
each
winter
so
soapy
had
made
his
humble
arrangements
for
his
annual
hegira
to
the
island
and
now
the
time
was
come
on
the
previous
night
three
sabbath
newspapers
distributed
beneath
his
coat
about
his
ankles
and
over
his
lap
had
failed
to
repulse
the
cold
as
he
slept
on
his
bench
near
the
spurting
fountain
in
the
ancient
square
so
the
island
loomed
big
and
timely
in
mind
he
scorned
the
provisions
made
in
the
name
of
charity
for
the
city
dependents
in
soapy
opinion
the
law
was
more
benign
than
philanthropy
there
was
an
endless
round
of
institutions
municipal
and
eleemosynary
on
which
he
might
set
out
and
receive
lodging
and
food
accordant
with
the
simple
life
but
to
one
of
soapy
proud
spirit
the
gifts
of
charity
are
encumbered
if
not
in
coin
you
must
pay
in
humiliation
of
spirit
for
every
benefit
received
at
the
hands
of
philanthropy
as
caesar
had
his
brutus
every
bed
of
charity
must
have
its
toll
of
a
bath
every
loaf
of
bread
its
compensation
of
a
private
and
personal
inquisition
wherefore
it
is
better
to
be
a
guest
of
the
law
which
though
conducted
by
rules
does
not
meddle
unduly
with
a
gentleman
private
affairs
soapy
having
decided
to
go
to
the
island
at
once
set
about
accomplishing
his
desire
there
were
many
easy
ways
of
doing
this
the
pleasantest
was
to
dine
luxuriously
at
some
expensive
restaurant
and
then
after
declaring
insolvency
be
handed
over
quietly
and
without
uproar
to
a
policeman
an
accommodating
magistrate
would
do
the
rest
soapy
left
his
bench
and
strolled
out
of
the
square
and
across
the
level
sea
of
asphalt
where
broadway
and
fifth
avenue
flow
together
up
broadway
he
turned
and
halted
at
a
glittering
café
where
are
gathered
together
nightly
the
choicest
products
of
the
grape
the
silkworm
and
the
protoplasm
soapy
had
confidence
in
himself
from
the
lowest
button
of
his
vest
upward
he
was
shaven
and
his
coat
was
decent
and
his
neat
black
had
been
presented
to
him
by
a
lady
missionary
on
thanksgiving
day
if
he
could
reach
a
table
in
the
restaurant
unsuspected
success
would
be
his
the
portion
of
him
that
would
show
above
the
table
would
raise
no
doubt
in
the
waiter
mind
a
roasted
mallard
duck
thought
soapy
would
be
about
the
thing
with
a
bottle
of
chablis
and
then
camembert
a
and
a
cigar
one
dollar
for
the
cigar
would
be
enough
the
total
would
not
be
so
high
as
to
call
forth
any
supreme
manifestation
of
revenge
from
the
café
management
and
yet
the
meat
would
leave
him
filled
and
happy
for
the
journey
to
his
winter
refuge
but
as
soapy
set
foot
inside
the
restaurant
door
the
head
waiter
eye
fell
upon
his
frayed
trousers
and
decadent
shoes
strong
and
ready
hands
turned
him
about
and
conveyed
him
in
silence
and
haste
to
the
sidewalk
and
averted
the
ignoble
fate
of
the
menaced
mallard
soapy
turned
off
broadway
it
seemed
that
his
route
to
the
coveted
island
was
not
to
be
an
epicurean
one
some
other
way
of
entering
limbo
must
be
thought
of
at
a
corner
of
sixth
avenue
electric
lights
and
cunningly
displayed
wares
behind
made
a
shop
window
conspicuous
soapy
took
a
cobblestone
and
dashed
it
through
the
glass
people
came
running
around
the
corner
a
policeman
in
the
lead
soapy
stood
still
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
smiled
at
the
sight
of
brass
buttons
where
the
man
that
done
that
inquired
the
officer
excitedly
do
you
figure
out
that
i
might
have
had
something
to
do
with
it
said
soapy
not
without
sarcasm
but
friendly
as
one
greets
good
fortune
the
policeman
mind
refused
to
accept
soapy
even
as
a
clue
men
who
smash
windows
do
not
remain
to
parley
with
the
law
minions
they
take
to
their
heels
the
policeman
saw
a
man
half
way
down
the
block
running
to
catch
a
car
with
drawn
club
he
joined
in
the
pursuit
soapy
with
disgust
in
his
heart
loafed
along
twice
unsuccessful
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
was
a
restaurant
of
no
great
pretensions
it
catered
to
large
appetites
and
modest
purses
its
crockery
and
atmosphere
were
thick
its
soup
and
napery
thin
into
this
place
soapy
took
his
accusive
shoes
and
telltale
trousers
without
challenge
at
a
table
he
sat
and
consumed
beefsteak
flapjacks
doughnuts
and
pie
and
then
to
the
waiter
be
betrayed
the
fact
that
the
minutest
coin
and
himself
were
strangers
now
get
busy
and
call
a
cop
said
soapy
and
do
keep
a
gentleman
waiting
no
cop
for
youse
said
the
waiter
with
a
voice
like
butter
cakes
and
an
eye
like
the
cherry
in
a
manhattan
cocktail
hey
con
neatly
upon
his
left
ear
on
the
callous
pavement
two
waiters
pitched
soapy
he
arose
joint
by
joint
as
a
carpenter
rule
opens
and
beat
the
dust
from
his
clothes
arrest
seemed
but
a
rosy
dream
the
island
seemed
very
far
away
a
policeman
who
stood
before
a
drug
store
two
doors
away
laughed
and
walked
down
the
street
five
blocks
soapy
travelled
before
his
courage
permitted
him
to
woo
capture
again
this
time
the
opportunity
presented
what
he
fatuously
termed
to
himself
a
cinch
a
young
woman
of
a
modest
and
pleasing
guise
was
standing
before
a
show
window
gazing
with
sprightly
interest
at
its
display
of
shaving
mugs
and
inkstands
and
two
yards
from
the
window
a
large
policeman
of
severe
demeanour
leaned
against
a
water
plug
it
was
soapy
design
to
assume
the
role
of
the
despicable
and
execrated
masher
the
refined
and
elegant
appearance
of
his
victim
and
the
contiguity
of
the
conscientious
cop
encouraged
him
to
believe
that
he
would
soon
feel
the
pleasant
official
clutch
upon
his
arm
that
would
insure
his
winter
quarters
on
the
right
little
tight
little
isle
soapy
straightened
the
lady
missionary
tie
dragged
his
shrinking
cuffs
into
the
open
set
his
hat
at
a
killing
cant
and
sidled
toward
the
young
woman
he
made
eyes
at
her
was
taken
with
sudden
coughs
and
hems
smiled
smirked
and
went
brazenly
through
the
impudent
and
contemptible
litany
of
the
masher
with
half
an
eye
soapy
saw
that
the
policeman
was
watching
him
fixedly
the
young
woman
moved
away
a
few
steps
and
again
bestowed
her
absorbed
attention
upon
the
shaving
mugs
soapy
followed
boldly
stepping
to
her
side
raised
his
hat
and
said
ah
there
bedelia
do
you
want
to
come
and
play
in
my
yard
the
policeman
was
still
looking
the
persecuted
young
woman
had
but
to
beckon
a
finger
and
soapy
would
be
practically
en
route
for
his
insular
haven
already
he
imagined
he
could
feel
the
cozy
warmth
of
the
the
young
woman
faced
him
and
stretching
out
a
hand
caught
soapy
coat
sleeve
sure
mike
she
said
joyfully
if
you
blow
me
to
a
pail
of
suds
i
have
spoke
to
you
sooner
but
the
cop
was
watching
with
the
young
woman
playing
the
clinging
ivy
to
his
oak
soapy
walked
past
the
policeman
overcome
with
gloom
he
seemed
doomed
to
liberty
at
the
next
corner
he
shook
off
his
companion
and
ran
he
halted
in
the
district
where
by
night
are
found
the
lightest
streets
hearts
vows
and
librettos
women
in
furs
and
men
in
greatcoats
moved
gaily
in
the
wintry
air
a
sudden
fear
seized
soapy
that
some
dreadful
enchantment
had
rendered
him
immune
to
arrest
the
thought
brought
a
little
of
panic
upon
it
and
when
he
came
upon
another
policeman
lounging
grandly
in
front
of
a
transplendent
theatre
he
caught
at
the
immediate
straw
of
disorderly
conduct
on
the
sidewalk
soapy
began
to
yell
drunken
gibberish
at
the
top
of
his
harsh
voice
he
danced
howled
raved
and
otherwise
disturbed
the
welkin
the
policeman
twirled
his
club
turned
his
back
to
soapy
and
remarked
to
a
citizen
is
one
of
them
yale
lads
celebratin
the
goose
egg
they
give
to
the
hartford
college
noisy
but
no
harm
we
instructions
to
lave
them
be
disconsolate
soapy
ceased
his
unavailing
racket
would
never
a
policeman
lay
hands
on
him
in
his
fancy
the
island
seemed
an
unattainable
arcadia
he
buttoned
his
thin
coat
against
the
chilling
wind
in
a
cigar
store
he
saw
a
man
lighting
a
cigar
at
a
swinging
light
his
silk
umbrella
he
had
set
by
the
door
on
entering
soapy
stepped
inside
secured
the
umbrella
and
sauntered
off
with
it
slowly
the
man
at
the
cigar
light
followed
hastily
my
umbrella
he
said
sternly
oh
is
it
sneered
soapy
adding
insult
to
petit
larceny
well
why
do
you
call
a
policeman
i
took
it
your
umbrella
why
do
you
call
a
cop
there
stands
one
on
the
corner
the
umbrella
owner
slowed
his
steps
soapy
did
likewise
with
a
presentiment
that
luck
would
again
run
against
him
the
policeman
looked
at
the
two
curiously
of
course
said
the
umbrella
man
that
is
well
you
know
how
these
mistakes
occur
i
if
it
your
umbrella
i
hope
you
excuse
me
i
picked
it
up
this
morning
in
a
restaurant
if
you
recognise
it
as
yours
why
i
hope
you
of
course
it
mine
said
soapy
viciously
the
man
retreated
the
policeman
hurried
to
assist
a
tall
blonde
in
an
opera
cloak
across
the
street
in
front
of
a
street
car
that
was
approaching
two
blocks
away
soapy
walked
eastward
through
a
street
damaged
by
improvements
he
hurled
the
umbrella
wrathfully
into
an
excavation
he
muttered
against
the
men
who
wear
helmets
and
carry
clubs
because
he
wanted
to
fall
into
their
clutches
they
seemed
to
regard
him
as
a
king
who
could
do
no
wrong
at
length
soapy
reached
one
of
the
avenues
to
the
east
where
the
glitter
and
turmoil
was
but
faint
he
set
his
face
down
this
toward
madison
square
for
the
homing
instinct
survives
even
when
the
home
is
a
park
bench
but
on
an
unusually
quiet
corner
soapy
came
to
a
standstill
here
was
an
old
church
quaint
and
rambling
and
gabled
through
one
window
a
soft
light
glowed
where
no
doubt
the
organist
loitered
over
the
keys
making
sure
of
his
mastery
of
the
coming
sabbath
anthem
for
there
drifted
out
to
soapy
ears
sweet
music
that
caught
and
held
him
transfixed
against
the
convolutions
of
the
iron
fence
the
moon
was
above
lustrous
and
serene
vehicles
and
pedestrians
were
few
sparrows
twittered
sleepily
in
the
eaves
for
a
little
while
the
scene
might
have
been
a
country
churchyard
and
the
anthem
that
the
organist
played
cemented
soapy
to
the
iron
fence
for
he
had
known
it
well
in
the
days
when
his
life
contained
such
things
as
mothers
and
roses
and
ambitions
and
friends
and
immaculate
thoughts
and
collars
the
conjunction
of
soapy
receptive
state
of
mind
and
the
influences
about
the
old
church
wrought
a
sudden
and
wonderful
change
in
his
soul
he
viewed
with
swift
horror
the
pit
into
which
he
had
tumbled
the
degraded
days
unworthy
desires
dead
hopes
wrecked
faculties
and
base
motives
that
made
up
his
existence
and
also
in
a
moment
his
heart
responded
thrillingly
to
this
novel
mood
an
instantaneous
and
strong
impulse
moved
him
to
battle
with
his
desperate
fate
he
would
pull
himself
out
of
the
mire
he
would
make
a
man
of
himself
again
he
would
conquer
the
evil
that
had
taken
possession
of
him
there
was
time
he
was
comparatively
young
yet
he
would
resurrect
his
old
eager
ambitions
and
pursue
them
without
faltering
those
solemn
but
sweet
organ
notes
had
set
up
a
revolution
in
him
he
would
go
into
the
roaring
downtown
district
and
find
work
a
fur
importer
had
once
offered
him
a
place
as
driver
he
would
find
him
and
ask
for
the
position
he
would
be
somebody
in
the
world
he
would
soapy
felt
a
hand
laid
on
his
arm
he
looked
quickly
around
into
the
broad
face
of
a
policeman
what
are
you
doin
here
asked
the
officer
nothin
said
soapy
then
come
along
said
the
policeman
three
months
on
the
island
said
the
magistrate
in
the
police
court
the
next
morning
an
adjustment
of
nature
in
an
art
exhibition
the
other
day
i
saw
a
painting
that
had
been
sold
for
the
painter
was
a
young
scrub
out
of
the
west
named
kraft
who
had
a
favourite
food
and
a
pet
theory
his
pabulum
was
an
unquenchable
belief
in
the
unerring
artistic
adjustment
of
nature
his
theory
was
fixed
around
hash
with
poached
egg
there
was
a
story
behind
the
picture
so
i
went
home
and
let
it
drip
out
of
a
the
idea
of
kraft
but
that
is
not
the
beginning
of
the
story
three
years
ago
kraft
bill
judkins
a
poet
and
i
took
our
meals
at
cypher
on
eighth
avenue
i
say
took
when
we
had
money
cypher
got
it
off
of
us
as
he
expressed
it
we
had
no
credit
we
went
in
called
for
food
and
ate
it
we
paid
or
we
did
not
pay
we
had
confidence
in
cypher
sullenness
and
smouldering
ferocity
deep
down
in
his
sunless
soul
he
was
either
a
prince
a
fool
or
an
artist
he
sat
at
a
desk
covered
with
files
of
waiters
checks
so
old
that
i
was
sure
the
bottomest
one
was
for
clams
that
hendrik
hudson
had
eaten
and
paid
for
cypher
had
the
power
in
common
with
napoleon
iii
and
the
perch
of
throwing
a
film
over
his
eyes
rendering
opaque
the
windows
of
his
soul
once
when
we
left
him
unpaid
with
egregious
excuses
i
looked
back
and
saw
him
shaking
with
inaudible
laughter
behind
his
film
now
and
then
we
paid
up
back
scores
but
the
chief
thing
at
cypher
was
milly
milly
was
a
waitress
she
was
a
grand
example
of
kraft
theory
of
the
artistic
adjustment
of
nature
she
belonged
largely
to
waiting
as
minerva
did
to
the
art
of
scrapping
or
venus
to
the
science
of
serious
flirtation
pedestalled
and
in
bronze
she
might
have
stood
with
the
noblest
of
her
heroic
sisters
as
enlivening
the
world
she
belonged
to
cypher
you
expected
to
see
her
colossal
figure
loom
through
that
reeking
blue
cloud
of
smoke
from
frying
fat
just
as
you
expect
the
palisades
to
appear
through
a
drifting
hudson
river
fog
there
amid
the
steam
of
vegetables
and
the
vapours
of
acres
of
ham
and
the
crash
of
crockery
the
clatter
of
steel
the
screaming
of
short
orders
the
cries
of
the
hungering
and
all
the
horrid
tumult
of
feeding
man
surrounded
by
swarms
of
the
buzzing
winged
beasts
bequeathed
us
by
pharaoh
milly
steered
her
magnificent
way
like
some
great
liner
cleaving
among
the
canoes
of
howling
savages
our
goddess
of
grub
was
built
on
lines
so
majestic
that
they
could
be
followed
only
with
awe
her
sleeves
were
always
rolled
above
her
elbows
she
could
have
taken
us
three
musketeers
in
her
two
hands
and
dropped
us
out
of
the
window
she
had
seen
fewer
years
than
any
of
us
but
she
was
of
such
superb
evehood
and
simplicity
that
she
mothered
us
from
the
beginning
cypher
store
of
eatables
she
poured
out
upon
us
with
royal
indifference
to
price
and
quantity
as
from
a
cornucopia
that
knew
no
exhaustion
her
voice
rang
like
a
great
silver
bell
her
smile
was
and
frequent
she
seemed
like
a
yellow
sunrise
on
mountain
tops
i
never
saw
her
but
i
thought
of
the
yosemite
and
yet
somehow
i
could
never
think
of
her
as
existing
outside
of
cypher
there
nature
had
placed
her
and
she
had
taken
root
and
grown
mightily
she
seemed
happy
and
took
her
few
poor
dollars
on
saturday
nights
with
the
flushed
pleasure
of
a
child
that
receives
an
unexpected
donation
it
was
kraft
who
first
voiced
the
fear
that
each
of
us
must
have
held
latently
it
came
up
apropos
of
course
of
certain
questions
of
art
at
which
we
were
hammering
one
of
us
compared
the
harmony
existing
between
a
haydn
symphony
and
pistache
ice
cream
to
the
exquisite
congruity
between
milly
and
cypher
there
is
a
certain
fate
hanging
over
milly
said
kraft
and
if
it
overtakes
her
she
is
lost
to
cypher
and
to
us
she
will
grow
fat
asked
judkins
fearsomely
she
will
go
to
night
school
and
become
refined
i
ventured
anxiously
it
is
this
said
kraft
punctuating
in
a
puddle
of
spilled
coffee
with
a
stiff
forefinger
caesar
had
his
brutus
the
cotton

its
bollworm
the
chorus

the

the

his

its

i
interrupted
much
perturbed
you
do
not
think
that
milly
will
begin
to
lace
one
day
concluded
kraft
solemnly
there
will
come
to
cypher
for
a
plate
of
beans
a
millionaire
lumberman
from
wisconsin
and
he
will
marry
milly
never
exclaimed
judkins
and
i
in
horror
a
lumberman
repeated
kraft
hoarsely
and
a
millionaire
lumberman
i
sighed
despairingly
from
wisconsin
groaned
judkins
we
agreed
that
the
awful
fate
seemed
to
menace
her
few
things
were
less
improbable
milly
like
some
vast
virgin
stretch
of
pine
woods
was
made
to
catch
the
lumberman
eye
and
well
we
knew
the
habits
of
the
badgers
once
fortune
smiled
upon
them
straight
to
new
york
they
hie
and
lay
their
goods
at
the
feet
of
the
girl
who
serves
them
beans
in
a
beanery
why
the
alphabet
itself
connives
the
sunday
headliner
work
is
cut
for
him
winsome
waitress
wins
wealthy
wisconsin
woodsman
for
a
while
we
felt
that
milly
was
on
the
verge
of
being
lost
to
us
it
was
our
love
of
the
unerring
artistic
adjustment
of
nature
that
inspired
us
we
could
not
give
her
over
to
a
lumberman
doubly
accursed
by
wealth
and
provincialism
we
shuddered
to
think
of
milly
with
her
voice
modulated
and
her
elbows
covered
pouring
tea
in
the
marble
teepee
of
a
tree
murderer
no
in
cypher
she
belonged
in
the
bacon
smoke
the
cabbage
perfume
the
grand
wagnerian
chorus
of
hurled
ironstone
china
and
rattling
casters
our
fears
must
have
been
prophetic
for
on
that
same
evening
the
wildwood
discharged
upon
us
milly
preordained
confiscator
our
fee
to
adjustment
and
order
but
alaska
and
not
wisconsin
bore
the
burden
of
the
visitation
we
were
at
our
supper
of
beef
stew
and
dried
apples
when
he
trotted
in
as
if
on
the
heels
of
a
dog
team
and
made
one
of
the
mess
at
our
table
with
the
freedom
of
the
camps
he
assaulted
our
ears
and
claimed
the
fellowship
of
men
lost
in
the
wilds
of
a
hash
house
we
embraced
him
as
a
specimen
and
in
three
minutes
we
had
all
but
died
for
one
another
as
friends
he
was
rugged
and
bearded
and
he
had
just
come
off
the
trail
he
said
at
one
of
the
north
river
ferries
i
fancied
i
could
see
the
snow
dust
of
chilcoot
yet
powdering
his
shoulders
and
then
he
strewed
the
table
with
the
nuggets
stuffed
ptarmigans
bead
work
and
seal
pelts
of
the
returned
klondiker
and
began
to
prate
to
us
of
his
millions
bank
drafts
for
two
millions
was
his
summing
up
and
a
thousand
a
day
piling
up
from
my
claims
and
now
i
want
some
beef
stew
and
canned
peaches
i
never
got
off
the
train
since
i
mushed
out
of
seattle
and
i
hungry
the
stuff
the
niggers
feed
you
on
pullmans
do
count
you
gentlemen
order
what
you
want
and
then
milly
loomed
up
with
a
thousand
dishes
on
her
bare
arm
loomed
up
big
and
white
and
pink
and
awful
as
mount
saint
elias
with
a
smile
like
day
breaking
in
a
gulch
and
the
klondiker
threw
down
his
pelts
and
nuggets
as
dross
and
let
his
jaw
fall
and
stared
at
her
you
could
almost
see
the
diamond
tiaras
on
milly
brow
and
the
silk
paris
gowns
that
he
meant
to
buy
for
her
at
last
the
bollworm
had
attacked
the
cotton
the
poison
ivy
was
reaching
out
its
tendrils
to
entwine
the
summer
boarder
the
millionaire
lumberman
thinly
disguised
as
the
alaskan
miner
was
about
to
engulf
our
milly
and
upset
nature
adjustment
kraft
was
the
first
to
act
he
leaped
up
and
pounded
the
back
come
out
and
drink
he
shouted
drink
first
and
eat
afterward
judkins
seized
one
arm
and
i
the
other
gaily
roaringly
irresistibly
in
style
we
dragged
him
from
the
restaurant
to
a
café
stuffing
his
pockets
with
his
embalmed
birds
and
indigestible
nuggets
there
he
rumbled
a
roughly
protest
that
the
girl
for
my
money
he
declared
she
can
eat
out
of
my
skillet
the
rest
of
her
life
why
i
never
see
such
a
fine
girl
i
going
back
there
and
ask
her
to
marry
me
i
guess
she
wo
want
to
sling
hash
any
more
when
she
sees
the
pile
of
dust
i
got
you
take
another
whiskey
and
milk
now
kraft
persuaded
with
satan
smile
i
thought
you
fellows
were
better
sports
kraft
spent
his
puny
store
of
coin
at
the
bar
and
then
gave
judkins
and
me
such
an
appealing
look
that
we
went
down
to
the
last
dime
we
had
in
toasting
our
guest
then
when
our
ammunition
was
gone
and
the
klondiker
still
somewhat
sober
began
to
babble
again
of
milly
kraft
whispered
into
his
ear
such
a
polite
barbed
insult
relating
to
people
who
were
miserly
with
their
funds
that
the
miner
crashed
down
handful
after
handful
of
silver
and
notes
calling
for
all
the
fluids
in
the
world
to
drown
the
imputation
thus
the
work
was
accomplished
with
his
own
guns
we
drove
him
from
the
field
and
then
we
had
him
carted
to
a
distant
small
hotel
and
put
to
bed
with
his
nuggets
and
baby
stuffed
around
him
he
will
never
find
cypher
again
said
kraft
he
will
propose
to
the
first
white
apron
he
sees
in
a
dairy
restaurant
and
milly
i
mean
the
natural
adjustment
is
saved
and
back
to
cypher
went
we
three
and
finding
customers
scarce
we
joined
hands
and
did
an
indian
dance
with
milly
in
the
centre
this
i
say
happened
three
years
ago
and
about
that
time
a
little
luck
descended
upon
us
three
and
we
were
enabled
to
buy
costlier
and
less
wholesome
food
than
cypher
our
paths
separated
and
i
saw
kraft
no
more
and
judkins
seldom
but
as
i
said
i
saw
a
painting
the
other
day
that
was
sold
for
the
title
was
boadicea
and
the
figure
seemed
to
fill
all
but
of
all
the
picture
admirers
who
stood
before
it
i
believe
i
was
the
only
one
who
longed
for
boadicea
to
stalk
from
her
frame
bringing
me
hash
with
poached
egg
i
hurried
away
to
see
kraft
his
satanic
eyes
were
the
same
his
hair
was
worse
tangled
but
his
clothes
had
been
made
by
a
tailor
i
did
know
i
said
to
him
we
bought
a
cottage
in
the
bronx
with
the
money
said
he
any
evening
at
then
said
i
when
you
led
us
against
the
lumberman
the
klondiker
it
was
altogether
on
account
of
the
unerring
artistic
adjustment
of
nature
well
not
altogether
said
kraft
with
a
grin
memoirs
of
a
yellow
dog
i
do
suppose
it
will
knock
any
of
you
people
off
your
perch
to
read
a
contribution
from
an
animal
kipling
and
a
good
many
others
have
demonstrated
the
fact
that
animals
can
express
themselves
in
remunerative
english
and
no
magazine
goes
to
press
nowadays
without
an
animal
story
in
it
except
the
monthlies
that
are
still
running
pictures
of
bryan
and
the
mont
pelée
horror
but
you
need
look
for
any
literature
in
my
piece
such
as
bearoo
the
bear
and
snakoo
the
snake
and
tammanoo
the
tiger
talk
in
the
jungle
books
a
yellow
dog
that
spent
most
of
his
life
in
a
cheap
new
york
flat
sleeping
in
a
corner
on
an
old
sateen
underskirt
the
one
she
spilled
port
wine
on
at
the
lady
longshoremen
banquet
must
be
expected
to
perform
any
tricks
with
the
art
of
speech
i
was
born
a
yellow
pup
date
locality
pedigree
and
weight
unknown
the
first
thing
i
can
recollect
an
old
woman
had
me
in
a
basket
at
broadway
and
trying
to
sell
me
to
a
fat
lady
old
mother
hubbard
was
boosting
me
to
beat
the
band
as
a
genuine
fox
terrier
the
fat
lady
chased
a
v
around
among
the
samples
of
gros
grain
flannelette
in
her
shopping
bag
till
she
cornered
it
and
gave
up
from
that
moment
i
was
a
pet
a
mamma
own
wootsey
squidlums
say
gentle
reader
did
you
ever
have
a
woman
breathing
a
flavour
of
camembert
cheese
and
peau
pick
you
up
and
wallop
her
nose
all
over
you
remarking
all
the
time
in
an
emma
eames
tone
of
voice
oh
oo
um
oodlum
doodlum
woodlum
toodlum
skoodlums
from
a
pedigreed
yellow
pup
i
grew
up
to
be
an
anonymous
yellow
cur
looking
like
a
cross
between
an
angora
cat
and
a
box
of
lemons
but
my
mistress
never
tumbled
she
thought
that
the
two
primeval
pups
that
noah
chased
into
the
ark
were
but
a
collateral
branch
of
my
ancestors
it
took
two
policemen
to
keep
her
from
entering
me
at
the
madison
square
garden
for
the
siberian
bloodhound
prize
i
tell
you
about
that
flat
the
house
was
the
ordinary
thing
in
new
york
paved
with
parian
marble
in
the
entrance
hall
and
cobblestones
above
the
first
floor
our
fiat
was
three
well
not
flights
climbs
up
my
mistress
rented
it
unfurnished
and
put
in
the
regular
things
antique
unholstered
parlour
set
oil
chromo
of
geishas
in
a
harlem
tea
house
rubber
plant
and
husband
by
sirius
there
was
a
biped
i
felt
sorry
for
he
was
a
little
man
with
sandy
hair
and
whiskers
a
good
deal
like
mine
henpecked
well
toucans
and
flamingoes
and
pelicans
all
had
their
bills
in
him
he
wiped
the
dishes
and
listened
to
my
mistress
tell
about
the
cheap
ragged
things
the
lady
with
the
coat
on
the
second
floor
hung
out
on
her
line
to
dry
and
every
evening
while
she
was
getting
supper
she
made
him
take
me
out
on
the
end
of
a
string
for
a
walk
if
men
knew
how
women
pass
the
time
when
they
are
alone
they
never
marry

half
an
hour
talk
with
the
iceman
reading
a
package
of
old
letters
a
couple
of
pickles
and
two
bottles
of
malt
extract
one
hour
peeking
through
a
hole
in
the
window
shade
into
the
flat
across
the
that
about
all
there
is
to
it
twenty
minutes
before
time
for
him
to
come
home
from
work
she
straightens
up
the
house
fixes
her
rat
so
it
wo
show
and
gets
out
a
lot
of
sewing
for
a
bluff
i
led
a
dog
life
in
that
flat
all
day
i
lay
there
in
my
corner
watching
that
fat
woman
kill
time
i
slept
sometimes
and
had
pipe
dreams
about
being
out
chasing
cats
into
basements
and
growling
at
old
ladies
with
black
mittens
as
a
dog
was
intended
to
do
then
she
would
pounce
upon
me
with
a
lot
of
that
drivelling
poodle
palaver
and
kiss
me
on
the
nose
but
what
could
i
do
a
dog
ca
chew
cloves
i
began
to
feel
sorry
for
hubby
dog
my
cats
if
i
did
we
looked
so
much
alike
that
people
noticed
it
when
we
went
out
so
we
shook
the
streets
that
morgan
cab
drives
down
and
took
to
climbing
the
piles
of
last
december
snow
on
the
streets
where
cheap
people
live
one
evening
when
we
were
thus
promenading
and
i
was
trying
to
look
like
a
prize
bernard
and
the
old
man
was
trying
to
look
like
he
have
murdered
the
first
he
heard
play
i
looked
up
at
him
and
said
in
my
way
what
are
you
looking
so
sour
about
you
oakum
trimmed
lobster
she
do
kiss
you
you
do
have
to
sit
on
her
lap
and
listen
to
talk
that
would
make
the
book
of
a
musical
comedy
sound
like
the
maxims
of
epictetus
you
ought
to
be
thankful
you
not
a
dog
brace
up
benedick
and
bid
the
blues
begone
the
matrimonial
mishap
looked
down
at
me
with
almost
canine
intelligence
in
his
face
why
doggie
says
he
good
doggie
you
almost
look
like
you
could
speak
what
is
it
doggie
cats
cats
could
speak
but
of
course
he
could
understand
humans
were
denied
the
speech
of
animals
the
only
common
ground
of
communication
upon
which
dogs
and
men
can
get
together
is
in
fiction
in
the
flat
across
the
hall
from
us
lived
a
lady
with
a
terrier
her
husband
strung
it
and
took
it
out
every
evening
but
he
always
came
home
cheerful
and
whistling
one
day
i
touched
noses
with
the
in
the
hall
and
i
struck
him
for
an
elucidation
see
here
i
says
you
know
that
it
ai
the
nature
of
a
real
man
to
play
dry
nurse
to
a
dog
in
public
i
never
saw
one
leashed
to
a
yet
that
did
look
like
he
like
to
lick
every
other
man
that
looked
at
him
but
your
boss
comes
in
every
day
as
perky
and
set
up
as
an
amateur
prestidigitator
doing
the
egg
trick
how
does
he
do
it
do
tell
me
he
likes
it
him
says
the
why
he
uses
nature
own
remedy
he
gets
spifflicated
at
first
when
we
go
out
he
as
shy
as
the
man
on
the
steamer
who
would
rather
play
pedro
when
they
make
all
jackpots
by
the
time
we
been
in
eight
saloons
he
do
care
whether
the
thing
on
the
end
of
his
line
is
a
dog
or
a
catfish
i
lost
two
inches
of
my
tail
trying
to
sidestep
those
swinging
doors
the
pointer
i
got
from
that
terrier
vaudeville
please
copy
set
me
to
thinking
one
evening
about
my
mistress
ordered
him
to
get
busy
and
do
the
ozone
act
for
lovey
i
have
concealed
it
until
now
but
that
is
what
she
called
me
the
was
called
tweetness
i
consider
that
i
have
the
bulge
on
him
as
far
as
you
could
chase
a
rabbit
still
lovey
is
something
of
a
nomenclatural
tin
can
on
the
tail
of
self
respect
at
a
quiet
place
on
a
safe
street
i
tightened
the
line
of
my
custodian
in
front
of
an
attractive
refined
saloon
i
made
a
scramble
for
the
doors
whining
like
a
dog
in
the
press
despatches
that
lets
the
family
know
that
little
alice
is
bogged
while
gathering
lilies
in
the
brook
why
darn
my
eyes
says
the
old
man
with
a
grin
darn
my
eyes
if
the
son
of
a
seltzer
lemonade
ai
asking
me
in
to
take
a
drink
lem
me
see
how
long
it
been
since
i
saved
shoe
leather
by
keeping
one
foot
on
the
i
believe
i
i
knew
i
had
him
hot
scotches
he
took
sitting
at
a
table
for
an
hour
he
kept
the
campbells
coming
i
sat
by
his
side
rapping
for
the
waiter
with
my
tail
and
eating
free
lunch
such
as
mamma
in
her
flat
never
equalled
with
her
homemade
truck
bought
at
a
delicatessen
store
eight
minutes
before
papa
comes
home
when
the
products
of
scotland
were
all
exhausted
except
the
rye
bread
the
old
man
unwound
me
from
the
table
leg
and
played
me
outside
like
a
fisherman
plays
a
salmon
out
there
he
took
off
my
collar
and
threw
it
into
the
street
poor
doggie
says
he
good
doggie
she
sha
kiss
you
any
more
a
darned
shame
good
doggie
go
away
and
get
run
over
by
a
street
car
and
be
happy
i
refused
to
leave
i
leaped
and
frisked
around
the
old
man
legs
happy
as
a
pug
on
a
rug
you
old
i
said
to
him
you
old
beagle
ca
you
see
that
i
want
to
leave
you
ca
you
see
that
we
both
pups
in
the
wood
and
the
missis
is
the
cruel
uncle
after
you
with
the
dish
towel
and
me
with
the
flea
liniment
and
a
pink
bow
to
tie
on
my
tail
why
not
cut
that
all
out
and
be
pards
forever
more
maybe
you
say
he
did
understand
maybe
he
did
but
he
kind
of
got
a
grip
on
the
hot
scotches
and
stood
still
for
a
minute
thinking
doggie
says
he
finally
we
do
live
more
than
a
dozen
lives
on
this
earth
and
very
few
of
us
live
to
be
more
than
if
i
ever
see
that
flat
any
more
i
a
flat
and
if
you
do
you
flatter
and
no
flattery
i
offering
to
that
westward
ho
wins
out
by
the
length
of
a
dachshund
there
was
no
string
but
i
frolicked
along
with
my
master
to
the
street
ferry
and
the
cats
on
the
route
saw
reason
to
give
thanks
that
prehensile
claws
had
been
given
them
on
the
jersey
side
my
master
said
to
a
stranger
who
stood
eating
a
currant
bun
me
and
my
doggie
we
are
bound
for
the
rocky
mountains
but
what
pleased
me
most
was
when
my
old
man
pulled
both
of
my
ears
until
i
howled
and
said
you
common
son
of
a
door
mat
do
you
know
what
i
going
to
call
you
i
thought
of
lovey
and
i
whined
dolefully
i
going
to
call
you
says
my
master
and
if
i
had
five
tails
i
could
have
done
enough
wagging
to
do
justice
to
the
occasion
the
of
ikey
schoenstein
the
blue
light
drug
store
is
downtown
between
the
bowery
and
first
avenue
where
the
distance
between
the
two
streets
is
the
shortest
the
blue
light
does
not
consider
that
pharmacy
is
a
thing
of
scent
and
soda
if
you
ask
it
for
it
will
not
give
you
a
bonbon
the
blue
light
scorns
the
arts
of
modern
pharmacy
it
macerates
its
opium
and
percolates
its
own
laudanum
and
paregoric
to
this
day
pills
are
made
behind
its
tall
prescription
desk
pills
rolled
out
on
its
own
divided
with
a
spatula
rolled
with
the
finger
and
thumb
dusted
with
calcined
magnesia
and
delivered
in
little
round
pasteboard
the
store
is
on
a
corner
about
which
coveys
of
hilarious
children
play
and
become
candidates
for
the
cough
drops
and
soothing
syrups
that
wait
for
them
inside
ikey
schoenstein
was
the
night
clerk
of
the
blue
light
and
the
friend
of
his
customers
thus
it
is
on
the
east
side
where
the
heart
of
pharmacy
is
not
glacé
there
as
it
should
be
the
druggist
is
a
counsellor
a
confessor
an
adviser
an
able
and
willing
missionary
and
mentor
whose
learning
is
respected
whose
occult
wisdom
is
venerated
and
whose
medicine
is
often
poured
untasted
into
the
gutter
therefore
corniform
nose
and
narrow
figure
was
well
known
in
the
vicinity
of
the
blue
light
and
his
advice
and
notice
were
much
desired
ikey
roomed
and
breakfasted
at
riddle
two
squares
away
riddle
had
a
daughter
named
rosy
the
circumlocution
has
been
in
vain
you
must
have
guessed
it
ikey
adored
rosy
she
tinctured
all
his
thoughts
she
was
the
compound
extract
of
all
that
was
chemically
pure
and
officinal
the
dispensatory
contained
nothing
equal
to
her
but
ikey
was
timid
and
his
hopes
remained
insoluble
in
the
menstruum
of
his
backwardness
and
fears
behind
his
counter
he
was
a
superior
being
calmly
conscious
of
special
knowledge
and
worth
outside
he
was
a
purblind
rambler
with
clothes
stained
with
chemicals
and
smelling
of
socotrine
aloes
and
valerianate
of
ammonia
the
fly
in
ikey
ointment
thrice
welcome
pat
trope
was
chunk
mcgowan
mcgowan
was
also
striving
to
catch
the
bright
smiles
tossed
about
by
rosy
but
he
was
no
outfielder
as
ikey
was
he
picked
them
off
the
bat
at
the
same
time
he
was
ikey
friend
and
customer
and
often
dropped
in
at
the
blue
light
drug
store
to
have
a
bruise
painted
with
iodine
or
get
a
cut
after
a
pleasant
evening
spent
along
the
bowery
one
afternoon
mcgowan
drifted
in
in
his
silent
easy
way
and
sat
comely
hard
indomitable
upon
a
stool
ikey
said
he
when
his
friend
had
fetched
his
mortar
and
sat
opposite
grinding
gum
benzoin
to
a
powder
get
busy
with
your
ear
it
drugs
for
me
if
you
got
the
line
i
need
ikey
scanned
the
countenance
of
mcgowan
for
the
usual
evidences
of
conflict
but
found
none
take
your
coat
off
he
ordered
i
guess
already
that
you
have
been
stuck
in
the
ribs
with
a
knife
i
have
many
times
told
you
those
dagoes
would
do
you
up
mcgowan
smiled
not
them
he
said
not
any
dagoes
but
located
the
diagnosis
all
right
enough
it
under
my
coat
near
the
ribs
say
ikey
rosy
and
me
are
goin
to
run
away
and
get
married
ikey
left
forefinger
was
doubled
over
the
edge
of
the
mortar
holding
it
steady
he
gave
it
a
wild
rap
with
the
pestle
but
felt
it
not
meanwhile
mcgowan
smile
faded
to
a
look
of
perplexed
gloom
that
is
he
continued
if
she
keeps
in
the
notion
until
the
time
comes
we
been
layin
pipes
for
the
getaway
for
two
weeks
one
day
she
says
she
will
the
same
evenin
she
says
nixy
we
agreed
on
and
rosy
stuck
to
the
affirmative
this
time
for
two
whole
days
but
it
five
hours
yet
till
the
time
and
i
afraid
stand
me
up
when
it
comes
to
the
scratch
you
said
you
wanted
drugs
remarked
ikey
mcgowan
looked
ill
at
ease
and
harassed
a
condition
opposed
to
his
usual
line
of
demeanour
he
made
a
almanac
into
a
roll
and
fitted
it
with
unprofitable
carefulness
about
his
finger
i
would
have
this
double
handicap
make
a
false
start
for
a
million
he
said
i
got
a
little
flat
up
in
harlem
all
ready
with
chrysanthemums
on
the
table
and
a
kettle
ready
to
boil
and
i
engaged
a
pulpit
pounder
to
be
ready
at
his
house
for
us
at
it
got
to
come
off
and
if
rosy
do
change
her
mind
again
mr
mcgowan
ceased
a
prey
to
his
doubts
i
do
see
then
yet
said
ikey
shortly
what
makes
it
that
you
talk
of
drugs
or
what
i
can
be
doing
about
it
old
man
riddle
do
like
me
a
little
bit
went
on
the
uneasy
suitor
bent
upon
marshalling
his
arguments
for
a
week
he
has
let
rosy
step
outside
the
door
with
me
if
it
was
for
losin
a
boarder
they
have
bounced
me
long
ago
i
makin
a
week
and
she
never
regret
flyin
the
coop
with
chunk
mcgowan
you
will
excuse
me
chunk
said
ikey
i
must
make
a
prescription
that
is
to
be
called
for
soon
say
said
mcgowan
looking
up
suddenly
say
ikey
ai
there
a
drug
of
some
kind
some
kind
of
powders
that
make
a
girl
like
you
better
if
you
give
to
her
ikey
lip
beneath
his
nose
curled
with
the
scorn
of
superior
enlightenment
but
before
he
could
answer
mcgowan
continued
tim
lacy
told
me
he
got
some
once
from
a
croaker
uptown
and
fed
to
his
girl
in
soda
water
from
the
very
first
dose
he
was
and
everybody
else
looked
like
thirty
cents
to
her
they
was
married
in
less
than
two
weeks
strong
and
simple
was
chunk
mcgowan
a
better
reader
of
men
than
ikey
was
could
have
seen
that
his
tough
frame
was
strung
upon
fine
wires
like
a
good
general
who
was
about
to
invade
the
enemy
territory
he
was
seeking
to
guard
every
point
against
possible
failure
i
thought
went
on
chunk
hopefully
that
if
i
had
one
of
them
powders
to
give
rosy
when
i
see
her
at
supper
it
might
brace
her
up
and
keep
her
from
reneging
on
the
proposition
to
skip
i
guess
she
need
a
mule
team
to
drag
her
away
but
women
are
better
at
coaching
than
they
are
at
running
bases
if
the
stuff
work
just
for
a
couple
of
hours
it
do
the
trick
when
is
this
foolishness
of
running
away
to
be
happening
asked
ikey
nine
said
mcgowan
supper
at
seven
at
eight
rosy
goes
to
bed
with
a
headache
at
nine
old
parvenzano
lets
me
through
to
his
back
yard
where
there
a
board
off
riddle
fence
next
door
i
go
under
her
window
and
help
her
down
the
we
got
to
make
it
early
on
the
preacher
account
it
all
dead
easy
if
rosy
do
balk
when
the
flag
drops
can
you
fix
me
one
of
them
powders
ikey
ikey
schoenstein
rubbed
his
nose
slowly
chunk
said
he
it
is
of
drugs
of
that
nature
that
pharmaceutists
must
have
much
carefulness
to
you
alone
of
my
acquaintance
would
i
intrust
a
powder
like
that
but
for
you
i
shall
make
it
and
you
shall
see
how
it
makes
rosy
to
think
of
you
ikey
went
behind
the
prescription
desk
there
he
crushed
to
a
powder
two
soluble
tablets
each
containing
a
quarter
of
a
grain
of
morphia
to
them
he
added
a
little
sugar
of
milk
to
increase
the
bulk
and
folded
the
mixture
neatly
in
a
white
paper
taken
by
an
adult
this
powder
would
insure
several
hours
of
heavy
slumber
without
danger
to
the
sleeper
this
he
handed
to
chunk
mcgowan
telling
him
to
administer
it
in
a
liquid
if
possible
and
received
the
hearty
thanks
of
the
backyard
lochinvar
the
subtlety
of
ikey
action
becomes
apparent
upon
recital
of
his
subsequent
move
he
sent
a
messenger
for
riddle
and
disclosed
the
plans
of
mcgowan
for
eloping
with
rosy
riddle
was
a
stout
man
of
complexion
and
sudden
in
action
much
obliged
he
said
briefly
to
ikey
the
lazy
irish
loafer
my
own
room
just
above
rosy
i
just
go
up
there
myself
after
supper
and
load
the
and
wait
if
he
comes
in
my
back
yard
he
go
away
in
a
ambulance
instead
of
a
bridal
chaise
with
rosy
held
in
the
clutches
of
morpheus
for
a
deep
slumber
and
the
bloodthirsty
parent
waiting
armed
and
forewarned
ikey
felt
that
his
rival
was
close
indeed
upon
discomfiture
all
night
in
the
blue
light
drug
store
he
waited
at
his
duties
for
chance
news
of
the
tragedy
but
none
came
at
eight
in
the
morning
the
day
clerk
arrived
and
ikey
started
hurriedly
for
riddle
to
learn
the
outcome
and
lo
as
he
stepped
out
of
the
store
who
but
chunk
mcgowan
sprang
from
a
passing
street
car
and
grasped
his
hand
chunk
mcgowan
with
a
victor
smile
and
flushed
with
joy
pulled
it
off
said
chunk
with
elysium
in
his
grin
rosy
hit
the
on
time
to
a
second
and
we
was
under
the
wire
at
the
reverend
at
she
up
at
the
flat
she
cooked
eggs
this
mornin
in
a
blue
kimono
lord
how

pace
up
some
day

and
feed
with

i
got
a
job
down
near
the
bridge
and
that
where
i
heading
for
now
the
the
powder
stammered
ikey
oh
that
stuff
you
gave
me
said
chunk
broadening
his
grin
well
it
was
this
way
i
sat
down
at
the
supper
table
last
night
at
riddle
and
i
looked
at
rosy
and
i
says
to
myself
if
you
get
the
girl
get
her
on
the
square
do
try
any
with
a
thoroughbred
like
her
and
i
keeps
the
paper
you
give
me
in
my
pocket
and
then
my
lamps
fall
on
another
party
present
who
i
says
to
myself
is
failin
in
a
proper
affection
toward
his
comin
so
i
watches
my
chance
and
dumps
that
powder
in
old
man
riddle
coffee
see
mammon
and
the
archer
old
anthony
rockwall
retired
manufacturer
and
proprietor
of
eureka
soap
looked
out
the
library
window
of
his
fifth
avenue
mansion
and
grinned
his
neighbour
to
the
right
the
aristocratic
clubman
van
schuylight
came
out
to
his
waiting
wrinkling
a
contumelious
nostril
as
usual
at
the
italian
renaissance
sculpture
of
the
soap
palace
front
elevation
old
statuette
of
nothing
doing
commented
the
king
the
eden
musee
get
that
old
frozen
nesselrode
yet
if
he
do
watch
out
i
have
this
house
painted
red
white
and
blue
next
summer
and
see
if
that
make
his
dutch
nose
turn
up
any
higher
and
then
anthony
rockwall
who
never
cared
for
bells
went
to
the
door
of
his
library
and
shouted
mike
in
the
same
voice
that
had
once
chipped
off
pieces
of
the
welkin
on
the
kansas
prairies
tell
my
son
said
anthony
to
the
answering
menial
to
come
in
here
before
he
leaves
the
house
when
young
rockwall
entered
the
library
the
old
man
laid
aside
his
newspaper
looked
at
him
with
a
kindly
grimness
on
his
big
smooth
ruddy
countenance
rumpled
his
mop
of
white
hair
with
one
hand
and
rattled
the
keys
in
his
pocket
with
the
other
richard
said
anthony
rockwall
what
do
you
pay
for
the
soap
that
you
use
richard
only
six
months
home
from
college
was
startled
a
little
he
had
not
yet
taken
the
measure
of
this
sire
of
his
who
was
as
full
of
unexpectednesses
as
a
girl
at
her
first
party
six
dollars
a
dozen
i
think
dad
and
your
clothes
i
suppose
about
sixty
dollars
as
a
rule
you
a
gentleman
said
anthony
decidedly
i
heard
of
these
young
bloods
spending
a
dozen
for
soap
and
going
over
the
hundred
mark
for
clothes
you
got
as
much
money
to
waste
as
any
of
and
yet
you
stick
to
what
decent
and
moderate
now
i
use
the
old
eureka
not
only
for
sentiment
but
it
the
purest
soap
made
whenever
you
pay
more
than
cents
a
cake
for
soap
you
buy
bad
perfumes
and
labels
but
cents
is
doing
very
well
for
a
young
man
in
your
generation
position
and
condition
as
i
said
you
a
gentleman
they
say
it
takes
three
generations
to
make
one
they
off
money
do
it
as
slick
as
soap
grease
it
made
you
one
by
hokey
it
almost
made
one
of
me
i
nearly
as
impolite
and
disagreeable
and
as
these
two
old
knickerbocker
gents
on
each
side
of
me
that
ca
sleep
of
nights
because
i
bought
in
between
there
are
some
things
that
money
ca
accomplish
remarked
young
rockwall
rather
gloomily
now
do
say
that
said
old
anthony
shocked
i
bet
my
money
on
money
every
time
i
been
through
the
encyclopaedia
down
to
y
looking
for
something
you
ca
buy
with
it
and
i
expect
to
have
to
take
up
the
appendix
next
week
i
for
money
against
the
field
tell
me
something
money
wo
buy
for
one
thing
answered
richard
rankling
a
little
it
wo
buy
one
into
the
exclusive
circles
of
society
oho
wo
it
thundered
the
champion
of
the
root
of
evil
you
tell
me
where
your
exclusive
circles
would
be
if
the
first
astor
had
had
the
money
to
pay
for
his
steerage
passage
over
richard
sighed
and
that
what
i
was
coming
to
said
the
old
man
less
boisterously
that
why
i
asked
you
to
come
in
there
something
going
wrong
with
you
boy
i
been
noticing
it
for
two
weeks
out
with
it
i
guess
i
could
lay
my
hands
on
eleven
millions
within
hours
besides
the
real
estate
if
it
your
liver
there
the
down
in
the
bay
coaled
and
ready
to
steam
down
to
the
bahamas
in
two
days
not
a
bad
guess
dad
you
have
missed
it
far
ah
said
anthony
keenly
what
her
name
richard
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
library
floor
there
was
enough
comradeship
and
sympathy
in
this
crude
old
father
of
his
to
draw
his
confidence
why
do
you
ask
her
demanded
old
anthony
she
jump
at
you
you
got
the
money
and
the
looks
and
you
a
decent
boy
your
hands
are
clean
you
got
no
eureka
soap
on
you
been
to
college
but
she
overlook
that
i
have
had
a
chance
said
richard
make
one
said
anthony
take
her
for
a
walk
in
the
park
or
a
straw
ride
or
walk
home
with
her
from
church
chance
pshaw
you
do
know
the
social
mill
dad
she
part
of
the
stream
that
turns
it
every
hour
and
minute
of
her
time
is
arranged
for
days
in
advance
i
must
have
that
girl
dad
or
this
town
is
a
blackjack
swamp
forevermore
and
i
ca
write
it
i
ca
do
that
tut
said
the
old
man
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
with
all
the
money
i
got
you
ca
get
an
hour
or
two
of
a
girl
time
for
yourself
i
put
it
off
too
late
she
going
to
sail
for
europe
at
noon
day
after
for
a
two
years
stay
i
to
see
her
alone
evening
for
a
few
minutes
she
at
larchmont
now
at
her
aunt
i
go
there
but
i
allowed
to
meet
her
with
a
cab
at
the
grand
central
station
evening
at
the
train
we
drive
down
broadway
to
wallack
at
a
gallop
where
her
mother
and
a
box
party
will
be
waiting
for
us
in
the
lobby
do
you
think
she
would
listen
to
a
declaration
from
me
during
that
six
or
eight
minutes
under
those
circumstances
no
and
what
chance
would
i
have
in
the
theatre
or
afterward
none
no
dad
this
is
one
tangle
that
your
money
ca
unravel
we
ca
buy
one
minute
of
time
with
cash
if
we
could
rich
people
would
live
longer
there
no
hope
of
getting
a
talk
with
miss
lantry
before
she
sails
all
right
richard
my
boy
said
old
anthony
cheerfully
you
may
run
along
down
to
your
club
now
i
glad
it
ai
your
liver
but
forget
to
burn
a
few
punk
sticks
in
the
joss
house
to
the
great
god
mazuma
from
time
to
time
you
say
money
wo
buy
time
well
of
course
you
ca
order
eternity
wrapped
up
and
delivered
at
your
residence
for
a
price
but
i
seen
father
time
get
pretty
bad
stone
bruises
on
his
heels
when
he
walked
through
the
gold
diggings
that
night
came
aunt
ellen
gentle
sentimental
wrinkled
sighing
oppressed
by
wealth
in
to
brother
anthony
at
his
evening
paper
and
began
discourse
on
the
subject
of
lovers
woes
he
told
me
all
about
it
said
brother
anthony
yawning
i
told
him
my
bank
account
was
at
his
service
and
then
he
began
to
knock
money
said
money
could
help
said
the
rules
of
society
could
be
bucked
for
a
yard
by
a
team
of
oh
anthony
sighed
aunt
ellen
i
wish
you
would
not
think
so
much
of
money
wealth
is
nothing
where
a
true
affection
is
concerned
love
is
if
he
only
had
spoken
earlier
she
could
not
have
refused
our
richard
but
now
i
fear
it
is
too
late
he
will
have
no
opportunity
to
address
her
all
your
gold
can
not
bring
happiness
to
your
son
at
eight
the
next
evening
aunt
ellen
took
a
quaint
old
gold
ring
from
a
case
and
gave
it
to
richard
wear
it
nephew
she
begged
your
mother
gave
it
to
me
good
luck
in
love
she
said
it
brought
she
asked
me
to
give
it
to
you
when
you
had
found
the
one
you
loved
young
rockwall
took
the
ring
reverently
and
tried
it
on
his
smallest
finger
it
slipped
as
far
as
the
second
joint
and
stopped
he
took
it
off
and
stuffed
it
into
his
vest
pocket
after
the
manner
of
man
and
then
he
for
his
cab
at
the
station
he
captured
miss
lantry
out
of
the
gadding
mob
at
eight
we
must
keep
mamma
and
the
others
waiting
said
she
to
wallack
theatre
as
fast
as
you
can
drive
said
richard
loyally
they
whirled
up
to
broadway
and
then
down
the
lane
that
leads
from
the
soft
meadows
of
sunset
to
the
rocky
hills
of
morning
at
street
young
richard
quickly
thrust
up
the
trap
and
ordered
the
cabman
to
stop
i
dropped
a
ring
he
apologised
as
he
climbed
out
it
was
my
mother
and
i
hate
to
lose
it
i
wo
detain
you
a
minute
i
saw
where
it
fell
in
less
than
a
minute
he
was
back
in
the
cab
with
the
ring
but
within
that
minute
a
crosstown
car
had
stopped
directly
in
front
of
the
cab
the
cabman
tried
to
pass
to
the
left
but
a
heavy
express
wagon
cut
him
off
he
tried
the
right
and
had
to
back
away
from
a
furniture
van
that
had
no
business
to
be
there
he
tried
to
back
out
but
dropped
his
reins
and
swore
dutifully
he
was
blockaded
in
a
tangled
mess
of
vehicles
and
horses
one
of
those
street
blockades
had
occurred
that
sometimes
tie
up
commerce
and
movement
quite
suddenly
in
the
big
city
why
do
you
drive
on
said
miss
lantry
impatiently
we
be
late
richard
stood
up
in
the
cab
and
looked
around
he
saw
a
congested
flood
of
wagons
trucks
cabs
vans
and
street
cars
filling
the
vast
space
where
broadway
sixth
avenue
and
street
cross
one
another
as
a
inch
maiden
fills
her
inch
girdle
and
still
from
all
the
cross
streets
they
were
hurrying
and
rattling
toward
the
converging
point
at
full
speed
and
hurling
themselves
into
the
struggling
mass
locking
wheels
and
adding
their
drivers
imprecations
to
the
clamour
the
entire
traffic
of
manhattan
seemed
to
have
jammed
itself
around
them
the
oldest
new
yorker
among
the
thousands
of
spectators
that
lined
the
sidewalks
had
not
witnessed
a
street
blockade
of
the
proportions
of
this
one
i
very
sorry
said
richard
as
he
resumed
his
seat
but
it
looks
as
if
we
are
stuck
they
wo
get
this
jumble
loosened
up
in
an
hour
it
was
my
fault
if
i
had
dropped
the
ring
we
let
me
see
the
ring
said
miss
lantry
now
that
it
ca
be
helped
i
do
care
i
think
theatres
are
stupid
anyway
at
that
night
somebody
tapped
lightly
on
anthony
door
come
in
shouted
anthony
who
was
in
a
red
reading
a
book
of
piratical
adventures
somebody
was
aunt
ellen
looking
like
a
angel
that
had
been
left
on
earth
by
mistake
they
engaged
anthony
she
said
softly
she
has
promised
to
marry
our
richard
on
their
way
to
the
theatre
there
was
a
street
blockade
and
it
was
two
hours
before
their
cab
could
get
out
of
it
and
oh
brother
anthony
do
ever
boast
of
the
power
of
money
again
a
little
emblem
of
true
love
a
little
ring
that
symbolised
unending
and
unmercenary
affection
was
the
cause
of
our
richard
finding
his
happiness
he
dropped
it
in
the
street
and
got
out
to
recover
it
and
before
they
could
continue
the
blockade
occurred
he
spoke
to
his
love
and
won
her
there
while
the
cab
was
hemmed
in
money
is
dross
compared
with
true
love
anthony
all
right
said
old
anthony
i
glad
the
boy
has
got
what
he
wanted
i
told
him
i
would
spare
any
expense
in
the
matter
if
but
brother
anthony
what
good
could
your
money
have
done
sister
said
anthony
rockwall
i
got
my
pirate
in
a
devil
of
a
scrape
his
ship
has
just
been
scuttled
and
he
too
good
a
judge
of
the
value
of
money
to
let
drown
i
wish
you
would
let
me
go
on
with
this
chapter
the
story
should
end
here
i
wish
it
would
as
heartily
as
you
who
read
it
wish
it
did
but
we
must
go
to
the
bottom
of
the
well
for
truth
the
next
day
a
person
with
red
hands
and
a
blue
necktie
who
called
himself
kelly
called
at
anthony
rockwall
house
and
was
at
once
received
in
the
library
well
said
anthony
reaching
for
his
chequebook
it
was
a
good
of
soap
let
see
you
had
in
cash
i
paid
out
more
of
my
own
said
kelly
i
had
to
go
a
little
above
the
estimate
i
got
the
express
wagons
and
cabs
mostly
for
but
the
trucks
and
teams
mostly
raised
me
to
the
motormen
wanted
and
some
of
the
loaded
teams
the
cops
struck
me
hardest
i
paid
two
and
the
rest
and
but
did
it
work
beautiful
rockwall
i
glad
william
brady
was
onto
that
little
outdoor
vehicle
mob
scene
i
would
want
william
to
break
his
heart
with
jealousy
and
never
a
rehearsal
either
the
boys
was
on
time
to
the
fraction
of
a
second
it
was
two
hours
before
a
snake
could
get
below
greeley
statue
thirteen
hundred
there
you
are
kelly
said
anthony
tearing
off
a
check
your
thousand
and
the
you
were
out
you
do
despise
money
do
you
kelly
me
said
kelly
i
can
lick
the
man
that
invented
poverty
anthony
called
kelly
when
he
was
at
the
door
you
did
notice
said
he
anywhere
in
the
a
kind
of
a
fat
boy
without
any
clothes
on
shooting
arrows
around
with
a
bow
did
you
why
no
said
kelly
mystified
i
did
if
he
was
like
you
say
maybe
the
cops
pinched
him
before
i
got
there
i
thought
the
little
rascal
would
be
on
hand
chuckled

kelly
springtime
à
la
carte
it
was
a
day
in
march
never
never
begin
a
story
this
way
when
you
write
one
no
opening
could
possibly
be
worse
it
is
unimaginative
flat
dry
and
likely
to
consist
of
mere
wind
but
in
this
instance
it
is
allowable
for
the
following
paragraph
which
should
have
inaugurated
the
narrative
is
too
wildly
extravagant
and
preposterous
to
be
flaunted
in
the
face
of
the
reader
without
preparation
sarah
was
crying
over
her
bill
of
fare
think
of
a
new
york
girl
shedding
tears
on
the
menu
card
to
account
for
this
you
will
be
allowed
to
guess
that
the
lobsters
were
all
out
or
that
she
had
sworn
off
during
lent
or
that
she
had
ordered
onions
or
that
she
had
just
come
from
a
hackett
matinee
and
then
all
these
theories
being
wrong
you
will
please
let
the
story
proceed
the
gentleman
who
announced
that
the
world
was
an
oyster
which
he
with
his
sword
would
open
made
a
larger
hit
than
he
deserved
it
is
not
difficult
to
open
an
oyster
with
a
sword
but
did
you
ever
notice
any
one
try
to
open
the
terrestrial
bivalve
with
a
typewriter
like
to
wait
for
a
dozen
raw
opened
that
way
sarah
had
managed
to
pry
apart
the
shells
with
her
unhandy
weapon
far
enough
to
nibble
a
wee
bit
at
the
cold
and
clammy
world
within
she
knew
no
more
shorthand
than
if
she
had
been
a
graduate
in
stenography
just
let
slip
upon
the
world
by
a
business
college
so
not
being
able
to
stenog
she
could
not
enter
that
bright
galaxy
of
office
talent
she
was
a
typewriter
and
canvassed
for
odd
jobs
of
copying
the
most
brilliant
and
crowning
feat
of
sarah
battle
with
the
world
was
the
deal
she
made
with
schulenberg
home
restaurant
the
restaurant
was
next
door
to
the
old
red
brick
in
which
she
one
evening
after
dining
at
schulenberg
served
as
fast
as
you
throw
the
five
baseballs
at
the
coloured
gentleman
head
sarah
took
away
with
her
the
bill
of
fare
it
was
written
in
an
almost
unreadable
script
neither
english
nor
german
and
so
arranged
that
if
you
were
not
careful
you
began
with
a
toothpick
and
rice
pudding
and
ended
with
soup
and
the
day
of
the
week
the
next
day
sarah
showed
schulenberg
a
neat
card
on
which
the
menu
was
beautifully
typewritten
with
the
viands
temptingly
marshalled
under
their
right
and
proper
heads
from
hors
to
not
responsible
for
overcoats
and
umbrellas
schulenberg
became
a
naturalised
citizen
on
the
spot
before
sarah
left
him
she
had
him
willingly
committed
to
an
agreement
she
was
to
furnish
typewritten
bills
of
fare
for
the
tables
in
the
restaurant
a
new
bill
for
each
day
dinner
and
new
ones
for
breakfast
and
lunch
as
often
as
changes
occurred
in
the
food
or
as
neatness
required
in
return
for
this
schulenberg
was
to
send
three
meals
per
diem
to
sarah
hall
room
by
a
waiter
an
obsequious
one
if
possible
and
furnish
her
each
afternoon
with
a
pencil
draft
of
what
fate
had
in
store
for
schulenberg
customers
on
the
morrow
mutual
satisfaction
resulted
from
the
agreement
schulenberg
patrons
now
knew
what
the
food
they
ate
was
called
even
if
its
nature
sometimes
puzzled
them
and
sarah
had
food
during
a
cold
dull
winter
which
was
the
main
thing
with
her
and
then
the
almanac
lied
and
said
that
spring
had
come
spring
comes
when
it
comes
the
frozen
snows
of
january
still
lay
like
adamant
in
the
crosstown
streets
the
still
played
in
the
good
old
summertime
with
their
december
vivacity
and
expression
men
began
to
make
notes
to
buy
easter
dresses
janitors
shut
off
steam
and
when
these
things
happen
one
may
know
that
the
city
is
still
in
the
clutches
of
winter
one
afternoon
sarah
shivered
in
her
elegant
hall
bedroom
house
heated
scrupulously
clean
conveniences
seen
to
be
appreciated
she
had
no
work
to
do
except
schulenberg
menu
cards
sarah
sat
in
her
squeaky
willow
rocker
and
looked
out
the
window
the
calendar
on
the
wall
kept
crying
to
her
springtime
is
here
sarah
springtime
is
here
i
tell
you
look
at
me
sarah
my
figures
show
it
you
got
a
neat
figure
yourself
sarah
a
nice
springtime
figure
why
do
you
look
out
the
window
so
sadly
sarah
room
was
at
the
back
of
the
house
looking
out
the
window
she
could
see
the
windowless
rear
brick
wall
of
the
box
factory
on
the
next
street
but
the
wall
was
clearest
crystal
and
sarah
was
looking
down
a
grassy
lane
shaded
with
cherry
trees
and
elms
and
bordered
with
raspberry
bushes
and
cherokee
roses
spring
real
harbingers
are
too
subtle
for
the
eye
and
ear
some
must
have
the
flowering
crocus
the
dogwood
the
voice
of
bluebird
even
so
gross
a
reminder
as
the
farewell
handshake
of
the
retiring
buckwheat
and
oyster
before
they
can
welcome
the
lady
in
green
to
their
dull
bosoms
but
to
old
earth
choicest
kin
there
come
straight
sweet
messages
from
his
newest
bride
telling
them
they
shall
be
no
stepchildren
unless
they
choose
to
be
on
the
previous
summer
sarah
had
gone
into
the
country
and
loved
a
farmer
in
writing
your
story
never
hark
back
thus
it
is
bad
art
and
cripples
interest
let
it
march
march
sarah
stayed
two
weeks
at
sunnybrook
farm
there
she
learned
to
love
old
farmer
franklin
son
walter
farmers
have
been
loved
and
wedded
and
turned
out
to
grass
in
less
time
but
young
walter
franklin
was
a
modern
agriculturist
he
had
a
telephone
in
his
cow
house
and
he
could
figure
up
exactly
what
effect
next
year
canada
wheat
crop
would
have
on
potatoes
planted
in
the
dark
of
the
moon
it
was
in
this
shaded
and
raspberried
lane
that
walter
had
wooed
and
won
her
and
together
they
had
sat
and
woven
a
crown
of
dandelions
for
her
hair
he
had
immoderately
praised
the
effect
of
the
yellow
blossoms
against
her
brown
tresses
and
she
had
left
the
chaplet
there
and
walked
back
to
the
house
swinging
her
straw
sailor
in
her
hands
they
were
to
marry
in
the
spring
at
the
very
first
signs
of
spring
walter
said
and
sarah
came
back
to
the
city
to
pound
her
typewriter
a
knock
at
the
door
dispelled
sarah
visions
of
that
happy
day
a
waiter
had
brought
the
rough
pencil
draft
of
the
home
restaurant
next
day
fare
in
old
schulenberg
angular
hand
sarah
sat
down
to
her
typewriter
and
slipped
a
card
between
the
rollers
she
was
a
nimble
worker
generally
in
an
hour
and
a
half
the
menu
cards
were
written
and
ready
there
were
more
changes
on
the
bill
of
fare
than
usual
the
soups
were
lighter
pork
was
eliminated
from
the
entrées
figuring
only
with
russian
turnips
among
the
roasts
the
gracious
spirit
of
spring
pervaded
the
entire
menu
lamb
that
lately
capered
on
the
greening
hillsides
was
becoming
exploited
with
the
sauce
that
commemorated
its
gambols
the
song
of
the
oyster
though
not
silenced
was
con
the
seemed
to
be
held
inactive
behind
the
beneficent
bars
of
the
broiler
the
pie
list
swelled
the
richer
puddings
had
vanished
the
sausage
with
his
drapery
wrapped
about
him
barely
lingered
in
a
pleasant
thanatopsis
with
the
buckwheats
and
the
sweet
but
doomed
maple
sarah
fingers
danced
like
midgets
above
a
summer
stream
down
through
the
courses
she
worked
giving
each
item
its
position
according
to
its
length
with
an
accurate
eye
just
above
the
desserts
came
the
list
of
vegetables
carrots
and
peas
asparagus
on
toast
the
perennial
tomatoes
and
corn
and
succotash
lima
beans
cabbage
and
then
sarah
was
crying
over
her
bill
of
fare
tears
from
the
depths
of
some
divine
despair
rose
in
her
heart
and
gathered
to
her
eyes
down
went
her
head
on
the
little
typewriter
stand
and
the
keyboard
rattled
a
dry
accompaniment
to
her
moist
sobs
for
she
had
received
no
letter
from
walter
in
two
weeks
and
the
next
item
on
the
bill
of
fare
was
dandelions
dandelions
with
some
kind
of
egg
but
bother
the
egg
dandelions
with
whose
golden
blooms
walter
had
crowned
her
his
queen
of
love
and
future
bride
dandelions
the
harbingers
of
spring
her
sorrow
crown
of
sorrow
reminder
of
her
happiest
days
madam
i
dare
you
to
smile
until
you
suffer
this
test
let
the
marechal
niel
roses
that
percy
brought
you
on
the
night
you
gave
him
your
heart
be
served
as
a
salad
with
french
dressing
before
your
eyes
at
a
schulenberg
had
juliet
so
seen
her
love
tokens
dishonoured
the
sooner
would
she
have
sought
the
lethean
herbs
of
the
good
apothecary
but
what
a
witch
is
spring
into
the
great
cold
city
of
stone
and
iron
a
message
had
to
be
sent
there
was
none
to
convey
it
but
the
little
hardy
courier
of
the
fields
with
his
rough
green
coat
and
modest
air
he
is
a
true
soldier
of
fortune
this
this
lion
tooth
as
the
french
chefs
call
him
flowered
he
will
assist
at
wreathed
in
my
lady
hair
young
and
callow
and
unblossomed
he
goes
into
the
boiling
pot
and
delivers
the
word
of
his
sovereign
mistress
by
and
by
sarah
forced
back
her
tears
the
cards
must
be
written
but
still
in
a
faint
golden
glow
from
her
dandeleonine
dream
she
fingered
the
typewriter
keys
absently
for
a
little
while
with
her
mind
and
heart
in
the
meadow
lane
with
her
young
farmer
but
soon
she
came
swiftly
back
to
the
lanes
of
manhattan
and
the
typewriter
began
to
rattle
and
jump
like
a
motor
car
at
the
waiter
brought
her
dinner
and
carried
away
the
typewritten
bill
of
fare
when
sarah
ate
she
set
aside
with
a
sigh
the
dish
of
dandelions
with
its
crowning
ovarious
accompaniment
as
this
dark
mass
had
been
transformed
from
a
bright
and
flower
to
be
an
ignominious
vegetable
so
had
her
summer
hopes
wilted
and
perished
love
may
as
shakespeare
said
feed
on
itself
but
sarah
could
not
bring
herself
to
eat
the
dandelions
that
had
graced
as
ornaments
the
first
spiritual
banquet
of
her
heart
true
affection
at
the
couple
in
the
next
room
began
to
quarrel
the
man
in
the
room
above
sought
for
a
on
his
flute
the
gas
went
a
little
lower
three
coal
wagons
started
to
unload
the
only
sound
of
which
the
phonograph
is
jealous
cats
on
the
back
fences
slowly
retreated
toward
mukden
by
these
signs
sarah
knew
that
it
was
time
for
her
to
read
she
got
out
the
cloister
and
the
hearth
the
best
book
of
the
month
settled
her
feet
on
her
trunk
and
began
to
wander
with
gerard
the
front
door
bell
rang
the
landlady
answered
it
sarah
left
gerard
and
denys
treed
by
a
bear
and
listened
oh
yes
you
would
just
as
she
did
and
then
a
strong
voice
was
heard
in
the
hall
below
and
sarah
jumped
for
her
door
leaving
the
book
on
the
floor
and
the
first
round
easily
the
bear
you
have
guessed
it
she
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
just
as
her
farmer
came
up
three
at
a
jump
and
reaped
and
garnered
her
with
nothing
left
for
the
gleaners
why
have
you
written
oh
why
cried
sarah
new
york
is
a
pretty
large
town
said
walter
franklin
i
came
in
a
week
ago
to
your
old
address
i
found
that
you
went
away
on
a
thursday
that
consoled
some
it
eliminated
the
possible
friday
bad
luck
but
it
did
prevent
my
hunting
for
you
with
police
and
otherwise
ever
since
i
wrote
said
sarah
vehemently
never
got
it
then
how
did
you
find
me
the
young
farmer
smiled
a
springtime
smile
i
dropped
into
that
home
restaurant
next
door
this
evening
said
he
i
do
care
who
knows
it
i
like
a
dish
of
some
kind
of
greens
at
this
time
of
the
year
i
ran
my
eye
down
that
nice
typewritten
bill
of
fare
looking
for
something
in
that
line
when
i
got
below
cabbage
i
turned
my
chair
over
and
hollered
for
the
proprietor
he
told
me
where
you
lived
i
remember
sighed
sarah
happily
that
was
dandelions
below
cabbage
i
know
that
cranky
capital
w
above
the
line
that
your
typewriter
makes
anywhere
in
the
world
said
franklin
why
there
no
w
in
dandelions
said
sarah
in
surprise
the
young
man
drew
the
bill
of
fare
from
his
pocket
and
pointed
to
a
line
sarah
recognised
the
first
card
she
had
typewritten
that
afternoon
there
was
still
the
rayed
splotch
in
the
upper
corner
where
a
tear
had
fallen
but
over
the
spot
where
one
should
have
read
the
name
of
the
meadow
plant
the
clinging
memory
of
their
golden
blossoms
had
allowed
her
fingers
to

suppose
you
should
be
walking
down
broadway
after
dinner
with
ten
minutes
allotted
to
the
consummation
of
your
cigar
while
you
are
choosing
between
a
diverting
tragedy
and
something
serious
in
the
way
of
vaudeville
suddenly
a
hand
is
laid
upon
your
arm
you
turn
to
look
into
the
thrilling
eyes
of
a
beautiful
woman
wonderful
in
diamonds
and
russian
sables
she
thrusts
hurriedly
into
your
hand
an
extremely
hot
buttered
roll
flashes
out
a
tiny
pair
of
scissors
snips
off
the

of

ejaculates

swiftly
flies
down

looking
back
fearfully
over
her
shoulder
that
would
be
pure
adventure
would
you
accept
it
not
you
you
would
flush
with
embarrassment
you
would
sheepishly
drop
the
roll
and
continue
down
broadway
fumbling
feebly
for

this
you
would
do
unless
you
are
one
of
the
blessed
few
in
whom
the
pure
spirit
of
adventure
is
not
dead
true
adventurers
have
never
been
plentiful
they
who
are
set
down
in
print
as
such
have
been
mostly
business
men
with
newly
invented
methods
they
have
been
out
after
the
things
they
wanted
golden
fleeces
holy
grails
lady

treasure
crowns
and
fame
the
true
adventurer
goes
forth
aimless
and
uncalculating
to
meet
and
greet
unknown
fate
a
fine
example
was
the
prodigal
son
when
he
started
back
home
brave
and
splendid
figures
have
been
numerous
from
the
crusades
to
the
palisades
they
have
enriched
the
arts
of
history
and
fiction
and
the
trade
of
historical
fiction
but
each
of
them
had
a
prize
to
win
a
goal
to
kick
an
axe
to
grind
a
race
to
run
a
new
thrust
in
tierce
to
deliver
a

to
carve

to

so
they
were
not
followers
of

in
the
big
city
the
twin
spirits
romance
and
adventure
are
always
abroad
seeking
worthy
wooers
as
we
roam
the
streets
they
slyly
peep
at
us
and
challenge
us
in
twenty
different
guises
without
knowing
why
we
look
up
suddenly
to
see
in
a
window
a
face
that
seems
to
belong
to
our
gallery
of
intimate
portraits
in
a
sleeping
thoroughfare
we
hear
a
cry
of
agony
and
fear
coming
from
an
empty
and
shuttered
house
instead
of
at
our
familiar
curb
a
deposits
us
before
a
strange
door
which
one
with
a
smile
opens
for
us
and
bids
us
enter
a
slip
of
paper
written
upon
flutters
down
to
our
feet
from
the
high
lattices
of
chance
we
exchange
glances
of
instantaneous
hate
affection
and
fear
with
hurrying
strangers
in
the
passing
crowds
a
sudden
douse
of
rain
and
our
umbrella
may
be
sheltering
the
daughter
of
the
full
moon
and
first
cousin
of
the
sidereal
system
at
every
corner
handkerchiefs
drop
fingers
beckon
eyes
besiege
and
the
lost
the
lonely
the
rapturous
the
mysterious
the
perilous
changing
clues
of
adventure
are
slipped
into
our
fingers
but
few
of
us
are
willing
to
hold
and
follow
them
we
are
grown
stiff
with
the
ramrod
of
convention
down
our
backs
we
pass
on
and
some
day
we
come
at
the
end
of
a
very
dull
life
to
reflect
that
our
romance
has
been
a
pallid
thing
of
a
marriage
or
two
a
satin
rosette
kept
in
a
drawer
and
a
lifelong
feud
with
a
steam
radiator
rudolf
steiner
was
a
true
adventurer
few
were
the
evenings
on
which
he
did
not
go
forth
from
his
hall
bedchamber
in
search
of
the
unexpected
and
the
egregious
the
most
interesting
thing
in
life
seemed
to
him
to
be
what
might
lie
just
around
the
next
corner
sometimes
his
willingness
to
tempt
fate
led
him
into
strange
paths
twice
he
had
spent
the
night
in
a
again
and
again
he
had
found
himself
the
dupe
of
ingenious
and
mercenary
tricksters
his
watch
and
money
had
been
the
price
of
one
flattering
allurement
but
with
undiminished
ardour
he
picked
up
every
glove
cast
before
him
into
the
merry
lists
of
adventure
one
evening
rudolf
was
strolling
along
a
crosstown
street
in
the
older
central
part
of
the
city
two
streams
of
people
filled
the
sidewalks
the
and
that
restless
contingent
that
abandons
home
for
the
specious
welcome
of
the
the
young
adventurer
was
of
pleasing
presence
and
moved
serenely
and
watchfully
by
daylight
he
was
a
salesman
in
a
piano
store
he
wore
his
tie
drawn
through
a
topaz
ring
instead
of
fastened
with
a
stick
pin
and
once
he
had
written
to
the
editor
of
a
magazine
that
junie
love
test
by
miss
libbey
had
been
the
book
that
had
most
influenced
his
life
during
his
walk
a
violent
chattering
of
teeth
in
a
glass
case
on
the
sidewalk
seemed
at
first
to
draw
his
attention
with
a
qualm
to
a
restaurant
before
which
it
was
set
but
a
second
glance
revealed
the
electric
letters
of
a
dentist
sign
high
above
the
next
door
a
giant
negro
fantastically
dressed
in
a
red
embroidered
coat
yellow
trousers
and
a
military
cap
discreetly
distributed
cards
to
those
of
the
passing
crowd
who
consented
to
take
them
this
mode
of
dentistic
advertising
was
a
common
sight
to
rudolf
usually
he
passed
the
dispenser
of
the
dentist
cards
without
reducing
his
store
but
tonight
the
african
slipped
one
into
his
hand
so
deftly
that
he
retained
it
there
smiling
a
little
at
the
successful
feat
when
he
had
travelled
a
few
yards
further
he
glanced
at
the
card
indifferently
surprised
he
turned
it
over
and
looked
again
with
interest
one
side
of
the
card
was
blank
on
the
other
was
written
in
ink
three
words
the
green
door
and
then
rudolf
saw
three
steps
in
front
of
him
a
man
throw
down
the
card
the
negro
had
given
him
as
he
passed
rudolf
picked
it
up
it
was
printed
with
the
dentist
name
and
address
and
the
usual
schedule
of
plate
work
and
bridge
work
and
crowns
and
specious
promises
of
painless
operations
the
adventurous
piano
salesman
halted
at
the
corner
and
considered
then
he
crossed
the
street
walked
down
a
block
recrossed
and
joined
the
upward
current
of
people
again
without
seeming
to
notice
the
negro
as
he
passed
the
second
time
he
carelessly
took
the
card
that
was
handed
him
ten
steps
away
he
inspected
it
in
the
same
handwriting
that
appeared
on
the
first
card
the
green
door
was
inscribed
upon
it
three
or
four
cards
were
tossed
to
the
pavement
by
pedestrians
both
following
and
leading
him
these
fell
blank
side
up
rudolf
turned
them
over
every
one
bore
the
printed
legend
of
the
dental
parlours
rarely
did
the
arch
sprite
adventure
need
to
beckon
twice
to
rudolf
steiner
his
true
follower
but
twice
it
had
been
done
and
the
quest
was
on
rudolf
walked
slowly
back
to
where
the
giant
negro
stood
by
the
case
of
rattling
teeth
this
time
as
he
passed
he
received
no
card
in
spite
of
his
gaudy
and
ridiculous
garb
the
ethiopian
displayed
a
natural
barbaric
dignity
as
he
stood
offering
the
cards
suavely
to
some
allowing
others
to
pass
unmolested
every
half
minute
he
chanted
a
harsh
unintelligible
phrase
akin
to
the
jabber
of
car
conductors
and
grand
opera
and
not
only
did
he
withhold
a
card
this
time
but
it
seemed
to
rudolf
that
he
received
from
the
shining
and
massive
black
countenance
a
look
of
cold
almost
contemptuous
disdain
the
look
stung
the
adventurer
he
read
in
it
a
silent
accusation
that
he
had
been
found
wanting
whatever
the
mysterious
written
words
on
the
cards
might
mean
the
black
had
selected
him
twice
from
the
throng
for
their
recipient
and
now
seemed
to
have
condemned
him
as
deficient
in
the
wit
and
spirit
to
engage
the
enigma
standing
aside
from
the
rush
the
young
man
made
a
rapid
estimate
of
the
building
in
which
he
conceived
that
his
adventure
must
lie
five
stories
high
it
rose
a
small
restaurant
occupied
the
basement
the
first
floor
now
closed
seemed
to
house
millinery
or
furs
the
second
floor
by
the
winking
electric
letters
was
the
dentist
above
this
a
polyglot
babel
of
signs
struggled
to
indicate
the
abodes
of
palmists
dressmakers
musicians
and
doctors
still
higher
up
draped
curtains
and
milk
bottles
white
on
the
window
sills
proclaimed
the
regions
of
domesticity
after
concluding
his
survey
rudolf
walked
briskly
up
the
high
flight
of
stone
steps
into
the
house
up
two
flights
of
the
carpeted
stairway
he
continued
and
at
its
top
paused
the
hallway
there
was
dimly
lighted
by
two
pale
jets
of
gas
one
far
to
his
right
the
other
nearer
to
his
left
he
looked
toward
the
nearer
light
and
saw
within
its
wan
halo
a
green
door
for
one
moment
he
hesitated
then
he
seemed
to
see
the
contumelious
sneer
of
the
african
juggler
of
cards
and
then
he
walked
straight
to
the
green
door
and
knocked
against
it
moments
like
those
that
passed
before
his
knock
was
answered
measure
the
quick
breath
of
true
adventure
what
might
not
be
behind
those
green
panels
gamesters
at
play
cunning
rogues
baiting
their
traps
with
subtle
skill
beauty
in
love
with
courage
and
thus
planning
to
be
sought
by
it
danger
death
love
disappointment
ridicule
any
of
these
might
respond
to
that
temerarious
rap
a
faint
rustle
was
heard
inside
and
the
door
slowly
opened
a
girl
not
yet
twenty
stood
there
and
tottering
she
loosed
the
knob
and
swayed
weakly
groping
with
one
hand
rudolf
caught
her
and
laid
her
on
a
faded
couch
that
stood
against
the
wall
he
closed
the
door
and
took
a
swift
glance
around
the
room
by
the
light
of
a
flickering
gas
jet
neat
but
extreme
poverty
was
the
story
that
he
read
the
girl
lay
still
as
if
in
a
faint
rudolf
looked
around
the
room
excitedly
for
a
barrel
people
must
be
rolled
upon
a
barrel
who
no
no
that
was
for
drowned
persons
he
began
to
fan
her
with
his
hat
that
was
successful
for
he
struck
her
nose
with
the
brim
of
his
derby
and
she
opened
her
eyes
and
then
the
young
man
saw
that
hers
indeed
was
the
one
missing
face
from
his
heart
gallery
of
intimate
portraits
the
frank
grey
eyes
the
little
nose
turning
pertly
outward
the
chestnut
hair
curling
like
the
tendrils
of
a
pea
vine
seemed
the
right
end
and
reward
of
all
his
wonderful
adventures
but
the
face
was
wofully
thin
and
pale
the
girl
looked
at
him
calmly
and
then
smiled
fainted
did
i
she
asked
weakly
well
who
would
you
try
going
without
anything
to
eat
for
three
days
and
see
himmel
exclaimed
rudolf
jumping
up
wait
till
i
come
back
he
dashed
out
the
green
door
and
down
the
stairs
in
twenty
minutes
he
was
back
again
kicking
at
the
door
with
his
toe
for
her
to
open
it
with
both
arms
he
hugged
an
array
of
wares
from
the
grocery
and
the
restaurant
on
the
table
he
laid
them
bread
and
butter
cold
meats
cakes
pies
pickles
oysters
a
roasted
chicken
a
bottle
of
milk
and
one
of
tea
this
is
ridiculous
said
rudolf
blusteringly
to
go
without
eating
you
must
quit
making
election
bets
of
this
kind
supper
is
ready
he
helped
her
to
a
chair
at
the
table
and
asked
is
there
a
cup
for
the
tea
on
the
shelf
by
the
window
she
answered
when
he
turned
again
with
the
cup
he
saw
her
with
eyes
shining
rapturously
beginning
upon
a
huge
dill
pickle
that
she
had
rooted
out
from
the
paper
bags
with
a
woman
unerring
instinct
he
took
it
from
her
laughingly
and
poured
the
cup
full
of
milk
drink
that
first
he
ordered
and
then
you
shall
have
some
tea
and
then
a
chicken
wing
if
you
are
very
good
you
shall
have
a
pickle
and
now
if
you
allow
me
to
be
your
guest
we
have
supper
he
drew
up
the
other
chair
the
tea
brightened
the
girl
eyes
and
brought
back
some
of
her
colour
she
began
to
eat
with
a
sort
of
dainty
ferocity
like
some
starved
wild
animal
she
seemed
to
regard
the
young
man
presence
and
the
aid
he
had
rendered
her
as
a
natural
thing
not
as
though
she
undervalued
the
conventions
but
as
one
whose
great
stress
gave
her
the
right
to
put
aside
the
artificial
for
the
human
but
gradually
with
the
return
of
strength
and
comfort
came
also
a
sense
of
the
little
conventions
that
belong
and
she
began
to
tell
him
her
little
story
it
was
one
of
a
thousand
such
as
the
city
yawns
at
every
day
the
shop
girl
story
of
insufficient
wages
further
reduced
by
fines
that
go
to
swell
the
store
profits
of
time
lost
through
illness
and
then
of
lost
positions
lost
hope
and
the
knock
of
the
adventurer
upon
the
green
door
but
to
rudolf
the
history
sounded
as
big
as
the
iliad
or
the
crisis
in
junie
love
test
to
think
of
you
going
through
all
that
he
exclaimed
it
was
something
fierce
said
the
girl
solemnly
and
you
have
no
relatives
or
friends
in
the
city
none
whatever
i
am
all
alone
in
the
world
too
said
rudolf
after
a
pause
i
am
glad
of
that
said
the
girl
promptly
and
somehow
it
pleased
the
young
man
to
hear
that
she
approved
of
his
bereft
condition
very
suddenly
her
eyelids
dropped
and
she
sighed
deeply
i
awfully
sleepy
she
said
and
i
feel
so
good
then
rudolf
rose
and
took
his
hat
i
say
a
long
sleep
will
be
fine
for
you
he
held
out
his
hand
and
she
took
it
and
said
but
her
eyes
asked
a
question
so
eloquently
so
frankly
and
pathetically
that
he
answered
it
with
words
oh
i
coming
back
to
see
how
you
are
getting
along
you
ca
get
rid
of
me
so
easily
then
at
the
door
as
though
the
way
of
his
coming
had
been
so
much
less
important
than
the
fact
that
he
had
come
she
asked
how
did
you
come
to
knock
at
my
door
he
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
remembering
the
cards
and
felt
a
sudden
jealous
pain
what
if
they
had
fallen
into
other
hands
as
adventurous
as
his
quickly
he
decided
that
she
must
never
know
the
truth
he
would
never
let
her
know
that
he
was
aware
of
the
strange
expedient
to
which
she
had
been
driven
by
her
great
distress
one
of
our
piano
tuners
lives
in
this
house
he
said
i
knocked
at
your
door
by
mistake
the
last
thing
he
saw
in
the
room
before
the
green
door
closed
was
her
smile
at
the
head
of
the
stairway
he
paused
and
looked
curiously
about
him
and
then
he
went
along
the
hallway
to
its
other
end
and
coming
back
ascended
to
the
floor
above
and
continued
his
puzzled
explorations
every
door
that
he
found
in
the
house
was
painted
green
wondering
he
descended
to
the
sidewalk
the
fantastic
african
was
still
there
rudolf
confronted
him
with
his
two
cards
in
his
hand
will
you
tell
me
why
you
gave
me
these
cards
and
what
they
mean
he
asked
in
a
broad
grin
the
negro
exhibited
a
splendid
advertisement
of
his
master
profession
dar
it
is
boss
he
said
pointing
down
the
street
but
i
you
is
a
little
late
for
de
fust
act
looking
the
way
he
pointed
rudolf
saw
above
the
entrance
to
a
theatre
the
blazing
electric
sign
of
its
new
play
the
green
door
i
informed
dat

said
the
negro

cards

offer

sah
at
the
corner
of
the
block
in
which
he
lived
rudolf
stopped
for
a
glass
of
beer
and
a
cigar
when
he
had
come
out
with
his
lighted
weed
he
buttoned
his
coat
pushed
back
his
hat
and
said
stoutly
to
the
lamp
post
on
the
corner
all
the
same
i
believe
it
was
the
hand
of
fate
that
doped
out
the
way
for
me
to
find
her
which
conclusion
under
the
circumstances
certainly
admits
rudolf
steiner
to
the
ranks
of
the
true
followers
of
romance
and
adventure
from
the
cabby
seat
the
cabby
has
his
point
of
view
it
is
more
perhaps
than
that
of
a
follower
of
any
other
calling
from
the
high
swaying
seat
of
his
hansom
he
looks
upon
his
as
nomadic
particles
of
no
account
except
when
possessed
of
migratory
desires
he
is
jehu
and
you
are
goods
in
transit
be
you
president
or
vagabond
to
cabby
you
are
only
a
fare
he
takes
you
up
cracks
his
whip
joggles
your
vertebrae
and
sets
you
down
when
time
for
payment
arrives
if
you
exhibit
a
familiarity
with
legal
rates
you
come
to
know
what
contempt
is
if
you
find
that
you
have
left
your
pocketbook
behind
you
are
made
to
realise
the
mildness
of
imagination
it
is
not
an
extravagant
theory
that
the
cabby
singleness
of
purpose
and
concentrated
view
of
life
are
the
results
of
the
hansom
peculiar
construction
the
sits
aloft
like
jupiter
on
an
unsharable
seat
holding
your
fate
between
two
thongs
of
inconstant
leather
helpless
ridiculous
confined
bobbing
like
a
toy
mandarin
you
sit
like
a
rat
in
a
trap
you
before
whom
butlers
cringe
on
solid
land
and
must
squeak
upward
through
a
slit
in
your
peripatetic
sarcophagus
to
make
your
feeble
wishes
known
then
in
a
cab
you
are
not
even
an
occupant
you
are
contents
you
are
a
cargo
at
sea
and
the
cherub
that
sits
up
aloft
has
davy
street
and
number
by
heart
one
night
there
were
sounds
of
revelry
in
the
big
brick
next
door
but
one
to
mcgary
family
café
the
sounds
seemed
to
emanate
from
the
apartments
of
the
walsh
family
the
sidewalk
was
obstructed
by
an
assortment
of
interested
neighbours
who
opened
a
lane
from
time
to
time
for
a
hurrying
messenger
bearing
from
mcgary
goods
pertinent
to
festivity
and
diversion
the
sidewalk
contingent
was
engaged
in
comment
and
discussion
from
which
it
made
no
effort
to
eliminate
the
news
that
norah
walsh
was
being
married
in
the
fulness
of
time
there
was
an
eruption
of
the
to
the
sidewalk
the
uninvited
guests
enveloped
and
permeated
them
and
upon
the
night
air
rose
joyous
cries
congratulations
laughter
and
unclassified
noises
born
of
mcgary
oblations
to
the
hymeneal
scene
close
to
the
curb
stood
jerry
cab
was
jerry
called
but
no
more
lustrous
or
cleaner
hansom
than
his
ever
closed
its
doors
upon
point
lace
and
november
violets
and
jerry
horse
i
am
within
bounds
when
i
tell
you
that
he
was
stuffed
with
oats
until
one
of
those
old
ladies
who
leave
their
dishes
unwashed
at
home
and
go
about
having
expressmen
arrested
would
have
smiled
yes
smiled
to
have
seen
him
among
the
shifting
sonorous
pulsing
crowd
glimpses
could
be
had
of
jerry
high
hat
battered
by
the
winds
and
rains
of
many
years
of
his
nose
like
a
carrot
battered
by
the
frolicsome
athletic
progeny
of
millionaires
and
by
contumacious
fares
of
his
green
coat
admired
in
the
vicinity
of
mcgary
it
was
plain
that
jerry
had
usurped
the
functions
of
his
cab
and
was
carrying
a
load
indeed
the
figure
may
be
extended
and
he
be
likened
to
a
if
we
admit
the
testimony
of
a
youthful
spectator
who
was
heard
to
remark
jerry
has
got
a
bun
from
somewhere
among
the
throng
in
the
street
or
else
out
of
the
thin
stream
of
pedestrians
a
young
woman
tripped
and
stood
by
the
cab
the
professional
hawk
eye
of
jerry
caught
the
movement
he
made
a
lurch
for
the
cab
overturning
three
or
four
onlookers
and
himself
no
he
caught
the
cap
of
a
and
kept
his
feet
like
a
sailor
shinning
up
the
ratlins
during
a
squall
jerry
mounted
to
his
professional
seat
once
he
was
there
mcgary
liquids
were
baffled
he
seesawed
on
the
mizzenmast
of
his
craft
as
safe
as
a
steeple
jack
rigged
to
the
flagpole
of
a
skyscraper
step
in
lady
said
jerry
gathering
his
lines
the
young
woman
stepped
into
the
cab
the
doors
shut
with
a
bang
jerry
whip
cracked
in
the
air
the
crowd
in
the
gutter
scattered
and
the
fine
hansom
dashed
away
when
the
horse
had
hedged
a
little
his
first
spurt
of
speed
jerry
broke
the
lid
of
his
cab
and
called
down
through
the
aperture
in
the
voice
of
a
cracked
megaphone
trying
to
please
where
now
will
ye
be
drivin
to
anywhere
you
please
came
up
the
answer
musical
and
contented
is
drivin
for
pleasure
she
is
thought
jerry
and
then
he
suggested
as
a
matter
of
course
take
a
thrip
around
in
the
park
lady
be
ilegant
cool
and
fine
just
as
you
like
answered
the
fare
pleasantly
the
cab
headed
for
fifth
avenue
and
sped
up
that
perfect
street
jerry
bounced
and
swayed
in
his
seat
the
potent
fluids
of
mcgary
were
disquieted
and
they
sent
new
fumes
to
his
head
he
sang
an
ancient
song
of
killisnook
and
brandished
his
whip
like
a
baton
inside
the
cab
the
fare
sat
up
straight
on
the
cushions
looking
to
right
and
left
at
the
lights
and
houses
even
in
the
shadowed
hansom
her
eyes
shone
like
stars
at
twilight
when
they
reached
street
jerry
head
was
bobbing
and
his
reins
were
slack
but
his
horse
turned
in
through
the
park
gate
and
began
the
old
familiar
nocturnal
round
and
then
the
fare
leaned
back
entranced
and
breathed
deep
the
clean
wholesome
odours
of
grass
and
leaf
and
bloom
and
the
wise
beast
in
the
shafts
knowing
his
ground
struck
into
his
gait
and
kept
to
the
right
of
the
road
habit
also
struggled
successfully
against
jerry
increasing
torpor
he
raised
the
hatch
of
his
vessel
and
made
the
inquiry
that
cabbies
do
make
in
the
park
like
shtop
at
the
lady
gezzer
the
music
shtops
i
think
that
would
be
nice
said
the
fare
they
reined
up
with
a
plunge
at
the
casino
entrance
the
cab
doors
flew
open
the
fare
stepped
directly
upon
the
floor
at
once
she
was
caught
in
a
web
of
ravishing
music
and
dazzled
by
a
panorama
of
lights
and
colours
some
one
slipped
a
little
square
card
into
her
hand
on
which
was
printed
a
number
she
looked
around
and
saw
her
cab
twenty
yards
away
already
lining
up
in
its
place
among
the
waiting
mass
of
carriages
cabs
and
motor
cars
and
then
a
man
who
seemed
to
be
all
danced
backward
before
her
and
next
she
was
seated
at
a
little
table
by
a
railing
over
which
climbed
a
jessamine
vine
there
seemed
to
be
a
wordless
invitation
to
purchase
she
consulted
a
collection
of
small
coins
in
a
thin
purse
and
received
from
them
license
to
order
a
glass
of
beer
there
she
sat
inhaling
and
absorbing
it
all
the
life
in
a
fairy
palace
in
an
enchanted
wood
at
fifty
tables
sat
princes
and
queens
clad
in
all
the
silks
and
gems
of
the
world
and
now
and
then
one
of
them
would
look
curiously
at
fare
they
saw
a
plain
figure
dressed
in
a
pink
silk
of
the
kind
that
is
tempered
by
the
word
foulard
and
a
plain
face
that
wore
a
look
of
love
of
life
that
the
queens
envied
twice
the
long
hands
of
the
clocks
went
round
royalties
thinned
from
their
thrones
and
buzzed
or
clattered
away
in
their
vehicles
of
state
the
music
retired
into
cases
of
wood
and
bags
of
leather
and
baize
waiters
removed
cloths
pointedly
near
the
plain
figure
sitting
almost
alone
jerry
fare
rose
and
held
out
her
numbered
card
simply
is
there
anything
coming
on
the
ticket
she
asked
a
waiter
told
her
it
was
her
cab
check
and
that
she
should
give
it
to
the
man
at
the
entrance
this
man
took
it
and
called
the
number
only
three
hansoms
stood
in
line
the
driver
of
one
of
them
went
and
routed
out
jerry
asleep
in
his
cab
he
swore
deeply
climbed
to
the
bridge
and
steered
his
craft
to
the
pier
his
fare
entered
and
the
cab
whirled
into
the
cool
fastnesses
of
the
park
along
the
shortest
homeward
cuts
at
the
gate
a
glimmer
of
reason
in
the
form
of
sudden
suspicion
seized
upon
jerry
beclouded
mind
one
or
two
things
occurred
to
him
he
stopped
his
horse
raised
the
trap
and
dropped
his
phonographic
voice
like
a
lead
plummet
through
the
aperture
i
want
to
see
four
dollars
before
goin
any
further
on
th
thrip
have
ye
got
th
dough
four
dollars
laughed
the
fare
softly
dear
me
no
i
only
got
a
few
pennies
and
a
dime
or
two
jerry
shut
down
the
trap
and
slashed
his
horse
the
clatter
of
hoofs
strangled
but
could
not
drown
the
sound
of
his
profanity
he
shouted
choking
and
gurgling
curses
at
the
starry
heavens
he
cut
viciously
with
his
whip
at
passing
vehicles
he
scattered
fierce
and
oaths
and
imprecations
along
the
streets
so
that
a
late
truck
driver
crawling
homeward
heard
and
was
abashed
but
he
knew
his
recourse
and
made
for
it
at
a
gallop
at
the
house
with
the
green
lights
beside
the
steps
he
pulled
up
he
flung
wide
the
cab
doors
and
tumbled
heavily
to
the
ground
come
on
you
he
said
roughly
his
fare
came
forth
with
the
casino
dreamy
smile
still
on
her
plain
face
jerry
took
her
by
the
arm
and
led
her
into
the
police
station
a
sergeant
looked
keenly
across
the
desk
he
and
the
cabby
were
no
strangers
sargeant
began
jerry
in
his
old
raucous
martyred
thunderous
tones
of
complaint
i
got
a
fare
here
that
jerry
paused
he
drew
a
knotted
red
hand
across
his
brow
the
fog
set
up
by
mcgary
was
beginning
to
clear
away
a
fare
sargeant
he
continued
with
a
grin
that
i
want
to
inthroduce
to
ye
it
me
wife
that
i
married
at
ould
man
walsh
this
avening
and
a
divil
of
a
time
we
had
is
thrue
shake
hands
wid
sargeant
norah
and
we
be
off
to
home
before
stepping
into
the
cab
norah
sighed
profoundly
i
had
such
a
nice
time
jerry
said
she
an
unfinished
story
we
no
longer
groan
and
heap
ashes
upon
our
heads
when
the
flames
of
tophet
are
mentioned
for
even
the
preachers
have
begun
to
tell
us
that
god
is
radium
or
ether
or
some
scientific
compound
and
that
the
worst
we
wicked
ones
may
expect
is
a
chemical
reaction
this
is
a
pleasing
hypothesis
but
there
lingers
yet
some
of
the
old
goodly
terror
of
orthodoxy
there
are
but
two
subjects
upon
which
one
may
discourse
with
a
free
imagination
and
without
the
possibility
of
being
controverted
you
may
talk
of
your
dreams
and
you
may
tell
what
you
heard
a
parrot
say
both
morpheus
and
the
bird
are
incompetent
witnesses
and
your
listener
dare
not
attack
your
recital
the
baseless
fabric
of
a
vision
then
shall
furnish
my
theme
chosen
with
apologies
and
regrets
instead
of
the
more
limited
field
of
pretty
polly
small
talk
i
had
a
dream
that
was
so
far
removed
from
the
higher
criticism
that
it
had
to
do
with
the
ancient
respectable
and
lamented
theory
gabriel
had
played
his
trump
and
those
of
us
who
could
not
follow
suit
were
arraigned
for
examination
i
noticed
at
one
side
a
gathering
of
professional
bondsmen
in
solemn
black
and
collars
that
buttoned
behind
but
it
seemed
there
was
some
trouble
about
their
real
estate
titles
and
they
did
not
appear
to
be
getting
any
of
us
out
a
fly
cop
an
angel
policeman
flew
over
to
me
and
took
me
by
the
left
wing
near
at
hand
was
a
group
of
very
spirits
arraigned
for
judgment
do
you
belong
with
that
bunch
the
policeman
asked
who
are
they
was
my
answer
why
said
he
they
are
but
this
irrelevant
stuff
is
taking
up
space
that
the
story
should
occupy
dulcie
worked
in
a
department
store
she
sold
hamburg
edging
or
stuffed
peppers
or
automobiles
or
other
little
trinkets
such
as
they
keep
in
department
stores
of
what
she
earned
dulcie
received
six
dollars
per
week
the
remainder
was
credited
to
her
and
debited
to
somebody
account
in
the
ledger
kept
by
g
oh
primal
energy
you
say
reverend
doctor
well
then
in
the
ledger
of
primal
energy
during
her
first
year
in
the
store
dulcie
was
paid
five
dollars
per
week
it
would
be
instructive
to
know
how
she
lived
on
that
amount
do
care
very
well
probably
you
are
interested
in
larger
amounts
six
dollars
is
a
larger
amount
i
will
tell
you
how
she
lived
on
six
dollars
per
week
one
afternoon
at
six
when
dulcie
was
sticking
her
within
an
eighth
of
an
inch
of
her
she
said
to
her
chum
sadie
the
girl
that
waits
on
you
with
her
left
side
say
sade
i
made
a
date
for
dinner
this
evening
with
piggy
you
never
did
exclaimed
sadie
admiringly
well
ai
you
the
lucky
one
piggy
an
awful
swell
and
he
always
takes
a
girl
to
swell
places
he
took
blanche
up
to
the
hoffman
house
one
evening
where
they
have
swell
music
and
you
see
a
lot
of
swells
you
have
a
swell
time
dulce
dulcie
hurried
homeward
her
eyes
were
shining
and
her
cheeks
showed
the
delicate
pink
of
life
real
life
approaching
dawn
it
was
friday
and
she
had
fifty
cents
left
of
her
last
week
wages
the
streets
were
filled
with
the
floods
of
people
the
electric
lights
of
broadway
were
glowing
calling
moths
from
miles
from
leagues
from
hundreds
of
leagues
out
of
darkness
around
to
come
in
and
attend
the
singeing
school
men
in
accurate
clothes
with
faces
like
those
carved
on
cherry
stones
by
the
old
salts
in
sailors
homes
turned
and
stared
at
dulcie
as
she
sped
unheeding
past
them
manhattan
the
cereus
was
beginning
to
unfold
its
petals
dulcie
stopped
in
a
store
where
goods
were
cheap
and
bought
an
imitation
lace
collar
with
her
fifty
cents
that
money
was
to
have
been
spent
otherwise
fifteen
cents
for
supper
ten
cents
for
breakfast
ten
cents
for
lunch
another
dime
was
to
be
added
to
her
small
store
of
savings
and
five
cents
was
to
be
squandered
for
licorice
drops
the
kind
that
made
your
cheek
look
like
the
toothache
and
last
as
long
the
licorice
was
an
extravagance
almost
a
carouse
but
what
is
life
without
pleasures
dulcie
lived
in
a
furnished
room
there
is
this
difference
between
a
furnished
room
and
a
boardinghouse
in
a
furnished
room
other
people
do
not
know
it
when
you
go
hungry
dulcie
went
up
to
her
room
the
third
floor
back
in
a
west
side
she
lit
the
gas
scientists
tell
us
that
the
diamond
is
the
hardest
substance
known
their
mistake
landladies
know
of
a
compound
beside
which
the
diamond
is
as
putty
they
pack
it
in
the
tips
of
and
one
may
stand
on
a
chair
and
dig
at
it
in
vain
until
one
fingers
are
pink
and
bruised
a
hairpin
will
not
remove
it
therefore
let
us
call
it
immovable
so
dulcie
lit
the
gas
in
its
glow
we
will
observe
the
room
dresser
table
washstand
chair
of
this
much
the
landlady
was
guilty
the
rest
was
dulcie
on
the
dresser
were
her
treasures
a
gilt
china
vase
presented
to
her
by
sadie
a
calendar
issued
by
a
pickle
works
a
book
on
the
divination
of
dreams
some
rice
powder
in
a
glass
dish
and
a
cluster
of
artificial
cherries
tied
with
a
pink
ribbon
against
the
wrinkly
mirror
stood
pictures
of
general
kitchener
william
muldoon
the
duchess
of

final

it
had
never
been

i
am
in

some
of

piggy
needs
but
a
word
when
the
girls
named
him
an
undeserving
stigma
was
cast
upon
the
noble
family
of
swine
the
lesson
in
the
old
blue
spelling
book
begins
with
piggy
biography
he
was
fat
he
had
the
soul
of
a
rat
the
habits
of
a
bat
and
the
magnanimity
of
a
cat
he
wore
expensive
clothes
and
was
a
connoisseur
in
starvation
he
could
look
at
a
and
tell
you
to
an
hour
how
long
it
had
been
since
she
had
eaten
anything
more
nourishing
than
marshmallows
and
tea
he
hung
about
the
shopping

prowled

his
invitations

at
ten
minutes
to
seven
dulcie
was
ready
she
looked
at
herself
in
the
wrinkly
mirror
the
reflection
was
satisfactory
the
dark
blue
dress
fitting
without
a
wrinkle
the
hat
with
its
jaunty
black
feather
the
gloves
all
representing
even
of
food
itself
were
vastly
becoming
dulcie
forgot
everything
else
for
a
moment
except
that
she
was
beautiful
and
that
life
was
about
to
lift
a
corner
of
its
mysterious
veil
for
her
to
observe
its
wonders
no
gentleman
had
ever
asked
her
out
before
now
she
was
going
for
a
brief
moment
into
the
glitter
and
exalted
show
the
girls
said
that
piggy
was
a
spender
there
would
be
a
grand
dinner
and
music
and
splendidly
dressed
ladies
to
look
at
and
things
to
eat
that
strangely
twisted
the
girls
jaws
when
they
tried
to
tell
about
them
no
doubt
she
would
be
asked
out
again
there
was
a
blue
pongee
suit
in
a
window
that
she
knew
by
saving
twenty
cents
a
week
instead
of
ten
in
let
see
oh
it
would
run
into
years
but
there
was
a
store
in
seventh
avenue
where
somebody
knocked
at
the
door
dulcie
opened
it
the
landlady
stood
there
with
a
spurious
smile
sniffing
for
cooking
by
stolen
gas
a
gentleman
downstairs
to
see
you
she
said
name
is
mr
wiggins
by
such
epithet
was
piggy
known
to
unfortunate
ones
who
had
to
take
him
seriously
dulcie
turned
to
the
dresser
to
get
her
handkerchief
and
then
she
stopped
still
and
bit
her
underlip
hard
while
looking
in
her
mirror
she
had
seen
fairyland
and
herself
a
princess
just
awakening
from
a
long
slumber
she
had
forgotten
one
that
was
watching
her
with
sad
beautiful
stern
eyes
the
only
one
there
was
to
approve
or
condemn
what
she
did
straight
and
slender
and
tall
with
a
look
of
sorrowful
reproach
on
his
handsome
melancholy
face
general
kitchener
fixed
his
wonderful
eyes
on
her
out
of
his
gilt
photograph
frame
on
the
dresser
dulcie
turned
like
an
automatic
doll
to
the
landlady
tell
him
i
ca
go
she
said
dully
tell
him
i
sick
or
something
tell
him
i
not
going
out
after
the
door
was
closed
and
locked
dulcie
fell
upon
her
bed
crushing
her
black
tip
and
cried
for
ten
minutes
general
kitchener
was
her
only
friend
he
was
dulcie
ideal
of
a
gallant
knight
he
looked
as
if
he
might
have
a
secret
sorrow
and
his
wonderful
moustache
was
a
dream
and
she
was
a
little
afraid
of
that
stern
yet
tender
look
in
his
eyes
she
used
to
have
little
fancies
that
he
would
call
at
the
house
sometime
and
ask
for
her
with
his
sword
clanking
against
his
high
boots
once
when
a
boy
was
rattling
a
piece
of
chain
against
a
she
had
opened
the
window
and
looked
out
but
there
was
no
use
she
knew
that
general
kitchener
was
away
over
in
japan
leading
his
army
against
the
savage
turks
and
he
would
never
step
out
of
his
gilt
frame
for
her
yet
one
look
from
him
had
vanquished
piggy
that
night
yes
for
that
night
when
her
cry
was
over
dulcie
got
up
and
took
off
her
best
dress
and
put
on
her
old
blue
kimono
she
wanted
no
dinner
she
sang
two
verses
of
sammy
then
she
became
intensely
interested
in
a
little
red
speck
on
the
side
of
her
nose
and
after
that
was
attended
to
she
drew
up
a
chair
to
the
rickety
table
and
told
her
fortune
with
an
old
deck
of
cards
the
horrid
impudent
thing
she
said
aloud
and
i
never
gave
him
a
word
or
a
look
to
make
him
think
it
at
nine
dulcie
took
a
tin
box
of
crackers
and
a
little
pot
of
raspberry
jam
out
of
her
trunk
and
had
a
feast
she
offered
general
kitchener
some
jam
on
a
cracker
but
he
only
looked
at
her
as
the
sphinx
would
have
looked
at
a
butterfly
if
there
are
butterflies
in
the
desert
do
eat
it
if
you
do
want
to
said
dulcie
and
do
put
on
so
many
airs
and
scold
so
with
your
eyes
i
wonder
if
you
be
so
superior
and
snippy
if
you
had
to
live
on
six
dollars
a
week
it
was
not
a
good
sign
for
dulcie
to
be
rude
to
general
kitchener
and
then
she
turned
benvenuto
cellini
face
downward
with
a
severe
gesture
but
that
was
not
inexcusable
for
she
had
always
thought
he
was
henry
viii
and
she
did
not
approve
of
him
at
nine
dulcie
took
a
last
look
at
the
pictures
on
the
dresser
turned
out
the
light
and
skipped
into
bed
it
an
awful
thing
to
go
to
bed
with
a
look
at
general
kitchener
william
muldoon
the
duchess
of
marlborough
and
benvenuto
cellini
this
story
really
does
get
anywhere
at
all
the
rest
of
it
comes
later
sometime
when
piggy
asks
dulcie
again
to
dine
with
him
and
she
is
feeling
lonelier
than
usual
and
general
kitchener
happens
to
be
looking
the
other
way
and
then
as
i
said
before
i
dreamed
that
i
was
standing
near
a
crowd
of
angels
and
a
policeman
took
me
by
the
wing
and
asked
if
i
belonged
with
them
who
are
they
i
asked
why
said
he
they
are
the
men
who
hired
and
paid
five
or
six
dollars
a
week
to
live
on
are
you
one
of
the
bunch
not
on
your
immortality
said
i
i
only
the
fellow
that
set
fire
to
an
orphan
asylum
and
murdered
a
blind
man
for
his
pennies
the
caliph
cupid
and
the
clock
prince
michael
of
the
electorate
of
valleluna
sat
on
his
favourite
bench
in
the
park
the
coolness
of
the
september
night
quickened
the
life
in
him
like
a
rare
tonic
wine
the
benches
were
not
filled
for
park
loungers
with
their
stagnant
blood
are
prompt
to
detect
and
fly
home
from
the
crispness
of
early
autumn
the
moon
was
just
clearing
the
roofs
of
the
range
of
dwellings
that
bounded
the
quadrangle
on
the
east
children
laughed
and
played
about
the
fountain
in
the
shadowed
spots
fauns
and
hamadryads
wooed
unconscious
of
the
gaze
of
mortal
eyes
a

the
grace
of
our
stage

fluted
and
droned
in
a
side
street
around
the
enchanted
boundaries
of
the
little
park
street
cars
spat
and
mewed
and
the
stilted
trains
roared
like
tigers
and
lions
prowling
for
a
place
to
enter
and
above
the
trees
shone
the
great
round
shining
face
of
an
illuminated
clock
in
the
tower
of
an
antique
public
building
prince
michael
shoes
were
wrecked
far
beyond
the
skill
of
the
carefullest
cobbler
the
ragman
would
have
declined
any
negotiations
concerning
his
clothes
the
two
weeks
stubble
on
his
face
was
grey
and
brown
and
red
and
greenish
yellow
as
if
it
had
been
made
up
from
individual
contributions
from
the
chorus
of
a
musical
comedy
no
man
existed
who
had
money
enough
to
wear
so
bad
a
hat
as
his
prince
michael
sat
on
his
favourite
bench
and
smiled
it
was
a
diverting
thought
to
him
that
he
was
wealthy
enough
to
buy
every
one
of
those
bulky
mansions
that
faced
him
if
he
chose
he
could
have
matched
gold
equipages
jewels
art
treasures
estates
and
acres
with
any
croesus
in
this
proud
city
of
manhattan
and
scarcely
have
entered
upon
the
bulk
of
his
holdings
he
could
have
sat
at
table
with
reigning
sovereigns
the
social
world
the
world
of
art
the
fellowship
of
the
elect
adulation
imitation
the
homage
of
the
fairest
honours
from
the
highest
praise
from
the
wisest
flattery
esteem
credit
pleasure
fame
all
the
honey
of
life
was
waiting
in
the
comb
in
the
hive
of
the
world
for
prince
michael
of
the
electorate
of
valleluna
whenever
he
might
choose
to
take
it
but
his
choice
was
to
sit
in
rags
and
dinginess
on
a
bench
in
a
park
for
he
had
tasted
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
life
and
finding
it
bitter
in
his
mouth
had
stepped
out
of
eden
for
a
time
to
seek
distraction
close
to
the
unarmoured
beating
heart
of
the
world
these
thoughts
strayed
dreamily
through
the
mind
of
prince
michael
as
he
smiled
under
the
stubble
of
his
polychromatic
beard
lounging
thus
clad
as
the
poorest
of
mendicants
in
the
parks
he
loved
to
study
humanity
he
found
in
altruism
more
pleasure
than
his
riches
his
station
and
all
the
grosser
sweets
of
life
had
given
him
it
was
his
chief
solace
and
satisfaction
to
alleviate
individual
distress
to
confer
favours
upon
worthy
ones
who
had
need
of
succour
to
dazzle
unfortunates
by
unexpected
and
bewildering
gifts
of
truly
royal
magnificence
bestowed
however
with
wisdom
and
judiciousness
and
as
prince
michael
eye
rested
upon
the
glowing
face
of
the
great
clock
in
the
tower
his
smile
altruistic
as
it
was
became
slightly
tinged
with
contempt
big
thoughts
were
the
prince
and
it
was
always
with
a
shake
of
his
head
that
he
considered
the
subjugation
of
the
world
to
the
arbitrary
measures
of
time
the
comings
and
goings
of
people
in
hurry
and
dread
controlled
by
the
little
metal
moving
hands
of
a
clock
always
made
him
sad
by
and
by
came
a
young
man
in
evening
clothes
and
sat
upon
the
third
bench
from
the
prince
for
half
an
hour
he
smoked
cigars
with
nervous
haste
and
then
he
fell
to
watching
the
face
of
the
illuminated
clock
above
the
trees
his
perturbation
was
evident
and
the
prince
noted
in
sorrow
that
its
cause
was
connected
in
some
manner
with
the
slowly
moving
hands
of
the
timepiece
his
highness
arose
and
went
to
the
young
man
bench
i
beg
your
pardon
for
addressing
you
he
said
but
i
perceive
that
you
are
disturbed
in
mind
if
it
may
serve
to
mitigate
the
liberty
i
have
taken
i
will
add
that
i
am
prince
michael
heir
to
the
throne
of
the
electorate
of
valleluna
i
appear
incognito
of
course
as
you
may
gather
from
my
appearance
it
is
a
fancy
of
mine
to
render
aid
to
others
whom
i
think
worthy
of
it
perhaps
the
matter
that
seems
to
distress
you
is
one
that
would
more
readily
yield
to
our
mutual
efforts
the
young
man
looked
up
brightly
at
the
prince
brightly
but
the
perpendicular
line
of
perplexity
between
his
brows
was
not
smoothed
away
he
laughed
and
even
then
it
did
not
but
he
accepted
the
momentary
diversion
glad
to
meet
you
prince
he
said
good
humouredly
yes
i
say
you
were
incog
all
right
thanks
for
your
offer
of
assistance
but
i
see
where
your
would
help
things
any
it
a
kind
of
private
affair
you
know
but
thanks
all
the
same
prince
michael
sat
at
the
young
man
side
he
was
often
rebuffed
but
never
offensively
his
courteous
manner
and
words
forbade
that
clocks
said
the
prince
are
shackles
on
the
feet
of
mankind
i
have
observed
you
looking
persistently
at
that
clock
its
face
is
that
of
a
tyrant
its
numbers
are
false
as
those
on
a
lottery
ticket
its
hands
are
those
of
a
bunco
steerer
who
makes
an
appointment
with
you
to
your
ruin
let
me
entreat
you
to
throw
off
its
humiliating
bonds
and
to
cease
to
order
your
affairs
by
that
insensate
monitor
of
brass
and
steel
i
do
usually
said
the
young
man
i
carry
a
watch
except
when
got
my
radiant
rags
on
i
know
human
nature
as
i
do
the
trees
and
grass
said
the
prince
with
earnest
dignity
i
am
a
master
of
philosophy
a
graduate
in
art
and
i
hold
the
purse
of
a
fortunatus
there
are
few
mortal
misfortunes
that
i
can
not
alleviate
or
overcome
i
have
read
your
countenance
and
found
in
it
honesty
and
nobility
as
well
as
distress
i
beg
of
you
to
accept
my
advice
or
aid
do
not
belie
the
intelligence
i
see
in
your
face
by
judging
from
my
appearance
of
my
ability
to
defeat
your
troubles
the
young
man
glanced
at
the
clock
again
and
frowned
darkly
when
his
gaze
strayed
from
the
glowing
horologue
of
time
it
rested
intently
upon
a
red
brick
house
in
the
row
of
dwellings
opposite
to
where
he
sat
the
shades
were
drawn
and
the
lights
in
many
rooms
shone
dimly
through
them
ten
minutes
to
nine
exclaimed
the
young
man
with
an
impatient
gesture
of
despair
he
turned
his
back
upon
the
house
and
took
a
rapid
step
or
two
in
a
contrary
direction
remain
commanded
prince
michael
in
so
potent
a
voice
that
the
disturbed
one
wheeled
around
with
a
somewhat
chagrined
laugh
i
give
her
the
ten
minutes
and
then
i
off
he
muttered
and
then
aloud
to
the
prince
i
join
you
in
confounding
all
clocks
my
friend
and
throw
in
women
too
sit
down
said
the
prince
calmly
i
do
not
accept
your
addition
women
are
the
natural
enemies
of
clocks
and
therefore
the
allies
of
those
who
would
seek
liberation
from
these
monsters
that
measure
our
follies
and
limit
our
pleasures
if
you
will
so
far
confide
in
me
i
would
ask
you
to
relate
to
me
your
story
the
young
man
threw
himself
upon
the
bench
with
a
reckless
laugh
your
royal
highness
i
will
he
said
in
tones
of
mock
deference
do
you
see
yonder
house
the
one
with
three
upper
windows
lighted
well
at
i
stood
in
that
house
with
the
young
lady
i
am
that
is
i
was
engaged
to
i
had
been
doing
wrong
my
dear
prince
i
had
been
a
naughty
boy
and
she
had
heard
of
it
i
wanted
to
be
forgiven
of
course
we
are
always
wanting
women
to
forgive
us
are
we
prince
want
time
to
think
it
over
said
she
is
one
thing
certain
i
will
either
fully
forgive
you
or
i
will
never
see
your
face
again
there
will
be
no
business
at
eight
she
said
exactly
eight
you
may
be
watching
the
middle
upper
window
of
the
top
floor
if
i
decide
to
forgive
i
will
hang
out
of
that
window
a
white
silk
scarf
you
will
know
by
that
that
all
is
as
was
before
and
you
may
come
to
me
if
you
see
no
scarf
you
may
consider
that
everything
between
us
is
ended
forever
that
concluded
the
young
man
bitterly
is
why
i
have
been
watching
that
clock
the
time
for
the
signal
to
appear
has
passed
minutes
ago
do
you
wonder
that
i
am
a
little
disturbed
my
prince
of
rags
and
whiskers
let
me
repeat
to
you
said
prince
michael
in
his
even
tones
that
women
are
the
natural
enemies
of
clocks
clocks
are
an
evil
women
a
blessing
the
signal
may
yet
appear
never
on
your
principality
exclaimed
the
young
man
hopelessly
you
do
know
marian
of
course
she
always
on
time
to
the
minute
that
was
the
first
thing
about
her
that
attracted
me
i
got
the
mitten
instead
of
the
scarf
i
ought
to
have
known
at
that
my
goose
was
cooked
i
go
west
on
the
with
jack
milburn
the
up
i
try
jack
ranch
awhile
and
top
off
with
the
klondike
and
whiskey
er
er
prince
prince
michael
smiled
his
enigmatic
gentle
comprehending
smile
and
caught
the
coat
sleeve
of
the
other
the
brilliant
light
in
the
eyes
was
softening
to
a
dreamier
cloudy
translucence
wait
he
said
solemnly
till
the
clock
strikes
i
have
wealth
and
power
and
knowledge
above
most
men
but
when
the
clock
strikes
i
am
afraid
stay
by
me
until
then
this
woman
shall
be
yours
you
have
the
word
of
the
hereditary
prince
of
valleluna
on
the
day
of
your
marriage
i
will
give
you
and
a
palace
on
the
hudson
but
there
must
be
no
clocks
in
that
palace
they
measure
our
follies
and
limit
our
pleasures
do
you
agree
to
that
of
course
said
the
young
man
cheerfully
they
a
nuisance
anyway
always
ticking
and
striking
and
getting
you
late
for
dinner
he
glanced
again
at
the
clock
in
the
tower
the
hands
stood
at
three
minutes
to
nine
i
think
said
prince
michael
that
i
will
sleep
a
little
the
day
has
been
fatiguing
he
stretched
himself
upon
a
bench
with
the
manner
of
one
who
had
slept
thus
before
you
will
find
me
in
this
park
on
any
evening
when
the
weather
is
suitable
said
the
prince
sleepily
come
to
me
when
your
marriage
day
is
set
and
i
will
give
you
a
cheque
for
the
money
thanks
your
highness
said
the
young
man
seriously
it
does
look
as
if
i
would
need
that
palace
on
the
hudson
but
i
appreciate
your
offer
just
the
same
prince
michael
sank
into
deep
slumber
his
battered
hat
rolled
from
the
bench
to
the
ground
the
young
man
lifted
it
placed
it
over
the
frowsy
face
and
moved
one
of
the
grotesquely
relaxed
limbs
into
a
more
comfortable
position
poor
devil
he
said
as
he
drew
the
tattered
clothes
closer
about
the
prince
breast
sonorous
and
startling
came
the
stroke
of
from
the
clock
tower
the
young
man
sighed
again
turned
his
face
for
one
last
look
at
the
house
of
his
relinquished
hopes
and
cried
aloud
profane
words
of
holy
rapture
from
the
middle
upper
window
blossomed
in
the
dusk
a
waving
snowy
fluttering
wonderful
divine
emblem
of
forgiveness
and
promised
joy
by
came
a
citizen
rotund
comfortable
unknowing
of
the
delights
of
waving
silken
scarfs
on
the
borders
of
parks
will
you
oblige
me
with
the
time
sir
asked
the
young
man
and
the
citizen
shrewdly
conjecturing
his
watch
to
be
safe
dragged
it
out
and
announced
and
a
half
minutes
past
eight
sir
and
then
from
habit
he
glanced
at
the
clock
in
the
tower
and
made
further
oration
by
george
that
clock
half
an
hour
fast
first
time
in
ten
years
known
it
to
be
off
this
watch
of
mine
never
varies
a
but
the
citizen
was
talking
to
vacancy
he
turned
and
saw
his
hearer
a
fast
receding
black
shadow
flying
in
the
direction
of
a
house
with
three
lighted
upper
windows
and
in
the
morning
came
along
two
policemen
on
their
way
to
the
beats
they
owned
the
park
was
deserted
save
for
one
dilapidated
figure
that
sprawled
asleep
on
a
bench
they
stopped
and
gazed
upon
it
it
dopy
mike
said
one
he
hits
the
pipe
every
night
park
bum
for
twenty
years
on
his
last
legs
i
guess
the
other
policeman
stooped
and
looked
at
something
crumpled
and
crisp
in
the
hand
of
the
sleeper
gee
he
remarked
he
doped
out
a
bill
anyway
wish
i
knew
the
brand
of
hop
that
he
smokes
and
then
rap
rap
rap
went
the
club
of
realism
against
the
shoe
soles
of
prince
michael
of
the
electorate
of
valleluna
sisters
of
the
golden
circle
the
rubberneck
auto
was
about
ready
to
start
the
merry
had
been
assigned
to
their
seats
by
the
gentlemanly
conductor
the
sidewalk
was
blockaded
with
sightseers
who
had
gathered
to
stare
at
sightseers
justifying
the
natural
law
that
every
creature
on
earth
is
preyed
upon
by
some
other
creature
the
megaphone
man
raised
his
instrument
of
torture
the
inside
of
the
great
automobile
began
to
thump
and
throb
like
the
heart
of
a
coffee
drinker
the
nervously
clung
to
the
seats
the
old
lady
from
valparaiso
indiana
shrieked
to
be
put
ashore
but
before
a
wheel
turns
listen
to
a
brief
preamble
through
the
cardiaphone
which
shall
point
out
to
you
an
object
of
interest
on
life
sightseeing
tour
swift
and
comprehensive
is
the
recognition
of
white
man
for
white
man
in
african
wilds
instant
and
sure
is
the
spiritual
greeting
between
mother
and
babe
unhesitatingly
do
master
and
dog
commune
across
the
slight
gulf
between
animal
and
man
immeasurably
quick
and
sapient
are
the
brief
messages
between
one
and
one
beloved
but
all
these
instances
set
forth
only
slow
and
groping
interchange
of
sympathy
and
thought
beside
one
other
instance
which
the
rubberneck
coach
shall
disclose
you
shall
learn
if
you
have
not
learned
already
what
two
beings
of
all
earth
living
inhabitants
most
quickly
look
into
each
other
hearts
and
souls
when
they
meet
face
to
face
the
gong
whirred
and
the
car
moved
majestically
upon
its
instructive
tour
on
the
highest
rear
seat
was
james
williams
of
cloverdale
missouri
and
his
bride
capitalise
it
friend
typo
that
last
word
word
of
words
in
the
epiphany
of
life
and
love
the
scent
of
the
flowers
the
booty
of
the
bee
the
primal
drip
of
spring
waters
the
overture
of
the
lark
the
twist
of
lemon
peel
on
the
cocktail
of
creation
such
is
the
bride
holy
is
the
wife
revered
the
mother
galliptious
is
the
summer
girl
but
the
bride
is
the
certified
check
among
the
wedding
presents
that
the
gods
send
in
when
man
is
married
to
mortality
the
car
glided
up
the
golden
way
on
the
bridge
of
the
great
cruiser
the
captain
stood
trumpeting
the
sights
of
the
big
city
to
his
passengers
and
they
heard
the
sights
of
the
metropolis
thundered
forth
to
their
eyes
confused
delirious
with
excitement
and
provincial
longings
they
tried
to
make
ocular
responses
to
the
megaphonic
ritual
in
the
solemn
spires
of
spreading
cathedrals
they
saw
the
home
of
the
vanderbilts
in
the
busy
bulk
of
the
grand
central
depot
they
viewed
wonderingly
the
frugal
cot
of
russell
sage
bidden
to
observe
the
highlands
of
the
hudson
they
gaped
unsuspecting
at
the
upturned
mountains
of
a
sewer
to
many
the
elevated
railroad
was
the
rialto
on
the
stations
of
which
uniformed
men
sat
and
made
chop
suey
of
your
tickets
and
to
this
day
in
the
outlying
districts
many
have
it
that
chuck
connors
with
his
hand
on
his
heart
leads
reform
and
that
but
for
the
noble
municipal
efforts
of
one
parkhurst
a
district
attorney
the
notorious
bishop
potter
gang
would
have
destroyed
law
and
order
from
the
bowery
to
the
harlem
river
but
i
beg
you
to
observe
james
williams
hattie
chalmers
that
was
once
the
belle
of
cloverdale
is
the
bride
if
she
will
and
this
colour
she
had
honoured
willingly
had
the
moss
rosebud
loaned
to
her
cheeks
of
its
pink
and
as
for
the
violet
her
eyes
will
do
very
well
as
they
are
thank
you
a
useless
strip
of
white
chaf
oh
no
he
was
guiding
the
auto
car
of
white
chiffon
or
perhaps
it
was
grenadine
or
tulle
was
tied
beneath
her
chin
pretending
to
hold
her
bonnet
in
place
but
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
the
hatpins
did
the
work
and
on
james
williams
face
was
recorded
a
little
library
of
the
world
best
thoughts
in
three
volumes
volume
no
contained
the
belief
that
james
williams
was
about
the
right
sort
of
thing
volume
no
was
an
essay
on
the
world
declaring
it
to
be
a
very
excellent
place
volume
no
disclosed
the
belief
that
in
occupying
the
highest
seat
in
a
rubberneck
auto
they
were
travelling
the
pace
that
passes
all
understanding
james
williams
you
would
have
guessed
was
about
it
will
gratify
you
to
know
that
your
estimate
was
so
accurate
he
was
exactly
years
eleven
months
and
days
old
he
was
well
built
active
and
rising
he
was
on
his
wedding
trip
dear
kind
fairy
please
cut
out
those
orders
for
money
and
touring
cars
and
fame
and
a
new
growth
of
hair
and
the
presidency
of
the
boat
club
instead
of
any
of
them
turn
backward
oh
turn
backward
and
give
us
just
a
bit
of
our
wedding
trip
over
again
just
an
hour
dear
fairy
so
we
can
remember
how
the
grass
and
poplar
trees
looked
and
the
bow
of
those
bonnet
strings
tied
beneath
her
chin
even
if
it
was
the
hatpins
that
did
the
work
ca
do
it
very
well
hurry
up
with
that
touring
car
and
the
oil
stock
then
just
in
front
of
james
williams
sat
a
girl
in
a
loose
tan
jacket
and
a
straw
hat
adorned
with
grapes
and
roses
only
in
dreams
and
milliners
shops
do
we
alas
gather
grapes
and
roses
at
one
swipe
this
girl
gazed
with
large
blue
eyes
credulous
when
the
megaphone
man
roared
his
doctrine
that
millionaires
were
things
about
which
we
should
be
concerned
between
blasts
she
resorted
to
epictetian
philosophy
in
the
form
of
pepsin
chewing
gum
at
this
girl
right
hand
sat
a
young
man
about
he
was
active
and
but
if
his
description
seems
to
follow
that
of
james
williams
divest
it
of
anything
cloverdalian
this
man
belonged
to
hard
streets
and
sharp
corners
he
looked
keenly
about
him
seeming
to
begrudge
the
asphalt
under
the
feet
of
those
upon
whom
he
looked
down
from
his
perch
while
the
megaphone
barks
at
a
famous
hostelry
let
me
whisper
you
through
the
cardiaphone
to
sit
tight
for
now
things
are
about
to
happen
and
the
great
city
will
close
over
them
again
as
over
a
scrap
of
ticker
tape
floating
down
from
the
den
of
a
broad
street
bear
the
girl
in
the
tan
jacket
twisted
around
to
view
the
pilgrims
on
the
last
seat
the
other
passengers
she
had
absorbed
the
seat
behind
her
was
her
bluebeard
chamber
her
eyes
met
those
of
james
williams
between
two
ticks
of
a
watch
they
exchanged
their
life
experiences
histories
hopes
and
fancies
and
all
mind
you
with
the
eye
before
two
men
could
have
decided
whether
to
draw
steel
or
borrow
a
match
the
bride
leaned
forward
low
she
and
the
girl
spoke
rapidly
together
their
tongues
moving
quickly
like
those
of
two
serpents
a
comparison
that
is
not
meant
to
go
further
two
smiles
and
a
dozen
nods
closed
the
conference
and
now
in
the
broad
quiet
avenue
in
front
of
the
rubberneck
car
a
man
in
dark
clothes
stood
with
uplifted
hand
from
the
sidewalk
another
hurried
to
join
him
the
girl
in
the
fruitful
hat
quickly
seized
her
companion
by
the
arm
and
whispered
in
his
ear
that
young
man
exhibited
proof
of
ability
to
act
promptly
crouching
low
he
slid
over
the
edge
of
the
car
hung
lightly
for
an
instant
and
then
disappeared
half
a
dozen
of
the
observed
his
feat
wonderingly
but
made
no
comment
deeming
it
prudent
not
to
express
surprise
at
what
might
be
the
conventional
manner
of
alighting
in
this
bewildering
city
the
truant
passenger
dodged
a
hansom
and
then
floated
past
like
a
leaf
on
a
stream
between
a
furniture
van
and
a
florist
delivery
wagon
the
girl
in
the
tan
jacket
turned
again
and
looked
in
the
eyes
of
james
williams
then
she
faced
about
and
sat
still
while
the
rubberneck
auto
stopped
at
the
flash
of
the
badge
under
the
coat
of
the
plainclothes
man
what
eatin
you
demanded
the
megaphonist
abandoning
his
professional
discourse
for
pure
english
keep
her
at
anchor
for
a
minute
ordered
the
officer
there
a
man
on
board
we
want
a
philadelphia
burglar
called
mcguire
there
he
is
on
the
back
seat
look
out
for
the
side
donovan
donovan
went
to
the
hind
wheel
and
looked
up
at
james
williams
come
down
old
sport
he
said
pleasantly
we
got
you
back
to
sleepytown
for
yours
it
ai
a
bad
idea
hidin
on
a
rubberneck
though
i
remember
that
softly
through
the
megaphone
came
the
advice
of
the
conductor
better
step
off
sir
and
explain
the
car
must
proceed
on
its
tour
james
williams
belonged
among
the
level
heads
with
necessary
slowness
he
picked
his
way
through
the
passengers
down
to
the
steps
at
the
front
of
the
car
his
wife
followed
but
she
first
turned
her
eyes
and
saw
the
escaped
tourist
glide
from
behind
the
furniture
van
and
slip
behind
a
tree
on
the
edge
of
the
little
park
not
fifty
feet
away
descended
to
the
ground
james
williams
faced
his
captors
with
a
smile
he
was
thinking
what
a
good
story
he
would
have
to
tell
in
cloverdale
about
having
been
mistaken
for
a
burglar
the
rubberneck
coach
lingered
out
of
respect
for
its
patrons
what
could
be
a
more
interesting
sight
than
this
my
name
is
james
williams
of
cloverdale
missouri
he
said
kindly
so
that
they
would
not
be
too
greatly
mortified
i
have
letters
here
that
will
show
you
come
with
us
please
announced
the
plainclothes
man
mcguire
description
fits
you
like
flannel
washed
in
hot
suds
a
detective
saw
you
on
the
rubberneck
up
at
central
park
and
down
to
take
you
in
do
your
explaining
at
the
james
williams
wife
his
bride
of
two
weeks
looked
him
in
the
face
with
a
strange
soft
radiance
in
her
eyes
and
a
flush
on
her
cheeks
looked
him
in
the
face
and
said
go
with
quietly
and
maybe
it
be
in
your
favour
and
then
as
the
car
rolled
away
she
turned
and
threw
a
kiss
his
wife
threw
a
kiss
at
some
one
high
up
on
the
seats
of
the
rubberneck
your
girl
gives
you
good
advice
mcguire
said
donovan
come
on
now
and
then
madness
descended
upon
and
occupied
james
williams
he
pushed
his
hat
far
upon
the
back
of
his
head
my
wife
seems
to
think
i
am
a
burglar
he
said
recklessly
i
never
heard
of
her
being
crazy
therefore
i
must
be
and
if
i
crazy
they
ca
do
anything
to
me
for
killing
you
two
fools
in
my
madness
whereupon
he
resisted
arrest
so
cheerfully
and
industriously
that
cops
had
to
be
whistled
for
and
afterwards
the
reserves
to
disperse
a
few
thousand
delighted
spectators
at
the
the
desk
sergeant
asked
for
his
name
mcdoodle
the
pink
or
pinky
the
brute
i
forget
which
was
james
williams
answer
but
you
can
bet
i
a
burglar
do
leave
that
out
and
you
might
add
that
it
took
five
of
to
pluck
the
pink
especially
like
to
have
that
in
the
records
in
an
hour
came
james
williams
with
uncle
thomas
of
madison
avenue
in
a
motor
car
and
proofs
of
the
innocence
for
all
the
world
like
the
third
act
of
a
drama
backed
by
an
automobile
mfg
after
the
police
had
sternly
reprimanded
james
williams
for
imitating
a
copyrighted
burglar
and
given
him
as
honourable
a
discharge
as
the
department
was
capable
of
williams
rearrested
him
and
swept
him
into
an
angle
of
the
james
williams
regarded
her
with
one
eye
he
always
said
that
donovan
closed
the
other
while
somebody
was
holding
his
good
right
hand
never
before
had
he
given
her
a
word
of
reproach
or
of
reproof
if
you
can
explain
he
began
rather
stiffly
why
you
dear
she
interrupted
listen
it
was
an
hour
pain
and
trial
to
you
i
did
it
for
her
i
mean
the
girl
who
spoke
to
me
on
the
coach
i
was
so
happy
jim
so
happy
with
you
that
i
did
dare
to
refuse
that
happiness
to
another
jim
they
were
married
only
this
morning
those
two
and
i
wanted
him
to
get
away
while
they
were
struggling
with
you
i
saw
him
slip
from
behind
his
tree
and
hurry
across
the
park
all
of
it
dear
i
had
to
do
it
thus
does
one
sister
of
the
plain
gold
band
know
another
who
stands
in
the
enchanted
light
that
shines
but
once
and
briefly
for
each
one
by
rice
and
satin
bows
does
mere
man
become
aware
of
weddings
but
bride
knoweth
bride
at
the
glance
of
an
eye
and
between
them
swiftly
passes
comfort
and
meaning
in
a
language
that
man
and
widows
wot
not
of
the
romance
of
a
busy
broker
pitcher
confidential
clerk
in
the
office
of
harvey
maxwell
broker
allowed
a
look
of
mild
interest
and
surprise
to
visit
his
usually
expressionless
countenance
when
his
employer
briskly
entered
at
half
past
nine
in
company
with
his
young
lady
stenographer
with
a
snappy
pitcher
maxwell
dashed
at
his
desk
as
though
he
were
intending
to
leap
over
it
and
then
plunged
into
the
great
heap
of
letters
and
telegrams
waiting
there
for
him
the
young
lady
had
been
maxwell
stenographer
for
a
year
she
was
beautiful
in
a
way
that
was
decidedly
unstenographic
she
forewent
the
pomp
of
the
alluring
pompadour
she
wore
no
chains
bracelets
or
lockets
she
had
not
the
air
of
being
about
to
accept
an
invitation
to
luncheon
her
dress
was
grey
and
plain
but
it
fitted
her
figure
with
fidelity
and
discretion
in
her
neat
black
turban
hat
was
the
wing
of
a
macaw
on
this
morning
she
was
softly
and
shyly
radiant
her
eyes
were
dreamily
bright
her
cheeks
genuine
peachblow
her
expression
a
happy
one
tinged
with
reminiscence
pitcher
still
mildly
curious
noticed
a
difference
in
her
ways
this
morning
instead
of
going
straight
into
the
adjoining
room
where
her
desk
was
she
lingered
slightly
irresolute
in
the
outer
office
once
she
moved
over
by
maxwell
desk
near
enough
for
him
to
be
aware
of
her
presence
the
machine
sitting
at
that
desk
was
no
longer
a
man
it
was
a
busy
new
york
broker
moved
by
buzzing
wheels
and
uncoiling
springs
well
what
is
it
anything
asked
maxwell
sharply
his
opened
mail
lay
like
a
bank
of
stage
snow
on
his
crowded
desk
his
keen
grey
eye
impersonal
and
brusque
flashed
upon
her
half
impatiently
nothing
answered
the
stenographer
moving
away
with
a
little
smile
pitcher
she
said
to
the
confidential
clerk
did
maxwell
say
anything
yesterday
about
engaging
another
stenographer
he
did
answered
pitcher
he
told
me
to
get
another
one
i
notified
the
agency
yesterday
afternoon
to
send
over
a
few
samples
this
morning
it
and
not
a
single
picture
hat
or
piece
of
pineapple
chewing
gum
has
showed
up
yet
i
will
do
the
work
as
usual
then
said
the
young
lady
until
some
one
comes
to
fill
the
place
and
she
went
to
her
desk
at
once
and
hung
the
black
turban
hat
with
the
macaw
wing
in
its
accustomed
place
he
who
has
been
denied
the
spectacle
of
a
busy
manhattan
broker
during
a
rush
of
business
is
handicapped
for
the
profession
of
anthropology
the
poet
sings
of
the
crowded
hour
of
glorious
life
the
broker
hour
is
not
only
crowded
but
the
minutes
and
seconds
are
hanging
to
all
the
straps
and
packing
both
front
and
rear
platforms
and
this
day
was
harvey
maxwell
busy
day
the
ticker
began
to
reel
out
jerkily
its
fitful
coils
of
tape
the
desk
telephone
had
a
chronic
attack
of
buzzing
men
began
to
throng
into
the
office
and
call
at
him
over
the
railing
jovially
sharply
viciously
excitedly
messenger
boys
ran
in
and
out
with
messages
and
telegrams
the
clerks
in
the
office
jumped
about
like
sailors
during
a
storm
even
pitcher
face
relaxed
into
something
resembling
animation
on
the
exchange
there
were
hurricanes
and
landslides
and
snowstorms
and
glaciers
and
volcanoes
and
those
elemental
disturbances
were
reproduced
in
miniature
in
the
broker
offices
maxwell
shoved
his
chair
against
the
wall
and
transacted
business
after
the
manner
of
a
toe
dancer
he
jumped
from
ticker
to
from
desk
to
door
with
the
trained
agility
of
a
harlequin
in
the
midst
of
this
growing
and
important
stress
the
broker
became
suddenly
aware
of
a
fringe
of
golden
hair
under
a
nodding
canopy
of
velvet
and
ostrich
tips
an
imitation
sealskin
sacque
and
a
string
of
beads
as
large
as
hickory
nuts
ending
near
the
floor
with
a
silver
heart
there
was
a
young
lady
connected
with
these
accessories
and
pitcher
was
there
to
construe
her
lady
from
the
stenographer
agency
to
see
about
the
position
said
pitcher
maxwell
turned
half
around
with
his
hands
full
of
papers
and
ticker
tape
what
position
he
asked
with
a
frown
position
of
stenographer
said
pitcher
you
told
me
yesterday
to
call
them
up
and
have
one
sent
over
this
morning
you
are
losing
your
mind
pitcher
said
maxwell
why
should
i
have
given
you
any
such
instructions
miss
leslie
has
given
perfect
satisfaction
during
the
year
she
has
been
here
the
place
is
hers
as
long
as
she
chooses
to
retain
it
there
no
place
open
here
madam
countermand
that
order
with
the
agency
pitcher
and
do
bring
any
more
of
in
here
the
silver
heart
left
the
office
swinging
and
banging
itself
independently
against
the
office
furniture
as
it
indignantly
departed
pitcher
seized
a
moment
to
remark
to
the
bookkeeper
that
the
old
man
seemed
to
get
more
and
forgetful
every
day
of
the
world
the
rush
and
pace
of
business
grew
fiercer
and
faster
on
the
floor
they
were
pounding
half
a
dozen
stocks
in
which
maxwell
customers
were
heavy
investors
orders
to
buy
and
sell
were
coming
and
going
as
swift
as
the
flight
of
swallows
some
of
his
own
holdings
were
imperilled
and
the
man
was
working
like
some
delicate
strong
machine
strung
to
full
tension
going
at
full
speed
accurate
never
hesitating
with
the
proper
word
and
decision
and
act
ready
and
prompt
as
clockwork
stocks
and
bonds
loans
and
mortgages
margins
and
securities
here
was
a
world
of
finance
and
there
was
no
room
in
it
for
the
human
world
or
the
world
of
nature
when
the
luncheon
hour
drew
near
there
came
a
slight
lull
in
the
uproar
maxwell
stood
by
his
desk
with
his
hands
full
of
telegrams
and
memoranda
with
a
fountain
pen
over
his
right
ear
and
his
hair
hanging
in
disorderly
strings
over
his
forehead
his
window
was
open
for
the
beloved
janitress
spring
had
turned
on
a
little
warmth
through
the
waking
registers
of
the
earth
and
through
the
window
came
a
wandering
perhaps
a
lost
odour
a
delicate
sweet
odour
of
lilac
that
fixed
the
broker
for
a
moment
immovable
for
this
odour
belonged
to
miss
leslie
it
was
her
own
and
hers
only
the
odour
brought
her
vividly
almost
tangibly
before
him
the
world
of
finance
dwindled
suddenly
to
a
speck
and
she
was
in
the
next
room
twenty
steps
away
by
george
i
do
it
now
said
maxwell
half
aloud
i
ask
her
now
i
wonder
i
did
do
it
long
ago
he
dashed
into
the
inner
office
with
the
haste
of
a
short
trying
to
cover
he
charged
upon
the
desk
of
the
stenographer
she
looked
up
at
him
with
a
smile
a
soft
pink
crept
over
her
cheek
and
her
eyes
were
kind
and
frank
maxwell
leaned
one
elbow
on
her
desk
he
still
clutched
fluttering
papers
with
both
hands
and
the
pen
was
above
his
ear
miss
leslie
he
began
hurriedly
i
have
but
a
moment
to
spare
i
want
to
say
something
in
that
moment
will
you
be
my
wife
i
have
had
time
to
make
love
to
you
in
the
ordinary
way
but
i
really
do
love
you
talk
quick
please
those
fellows
are
clubbing
the
stuffing
out
of
union
pacific
oh
what
are
you
talking
about
exclaimed
the
young
lady
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
gazed
upon
him
do
you
understand
said
maxwell
restively
i
want
you
to
marry
me
i
love
you
miss
leslie
i
wanted
to
tell
you
and
i
snatched
a
minute
when
things
had
slackened
up
a
bit
they
calling
me
for
the
now
tell
to
wait
a
minute
pitcher
wo
you
miss
leslie
the
stenographer
acted
very
queerly
at
first
she
seemed
overcome
with
amazement
then
tears
flowed
from
her
wondering
eyes
and
then
she
smiled
sunnily
through
them
and
one
of
her
arms
slid
tenderly
about
the
broker
neck
i
know
now
she
said
softly
it
this
old
business
that
has
driven
everything
else
out
of
your
head
for
the
time
i
was
frightened
at
first
do
you
remember
harvey
we
were
married
last
evening
at
in
the
little
church
around
the
corner
after
twenty
years
the
policeman
on
the
beat
moved
up
the
avenue
impressively
the
impressiveness
was
habitual
and
not
for
show
for
spectators
were
few
the
time
was
barely
at
night
but
chilly
gusts
of
wind
with
a
taste
of
rain
in
them
had
well
nigh
the
streets
trying
doors
as
he
went
twirling
his
club
with
many
intricate
and
artful
movements
turning
now
and
then
to
cast
his
watchful
eye
adown
the
pacific
thoroughfare
the
officer
with
his
stalwart
form
and
slight
swagger
made
a
fine
picture
of
a
guardian
of
the
peace
the
vicinity
was
one
that
kept
early
hours
now
and
then
you
might
see
the
lights
of
a
cigar
store
or
of
an
lunch
counter
but
the
majority
of
the
doors
belonged
to
business
places
that
had
long
since
been
closed
when
about
midway
of
a
certain
block
the
policeman
suddenly
slowed
his
walk
in
the
doorway
of
a
darkened
hardware
store
a
man
leaned
with
an
unlighted
cigar
in
his
mouth
as
the
policeman
walked
up
to
him
the
man
spoke
up
quickly
it
all
right
officer
he
said
reassuringly
i
just
waiting
for
a
friend
it
an
appointment
made
twenty
years
ago
sounds
a
little
funny
to
you
does
it
well
i
explain
if
you
like
to
make
certain
it
all
straight
about
that
long
ago
there
used
to
be
a
restaurant
where
this
store
stands
joe
brady
restaurant
until
five
years
ago
said
the
policeman
it
was
torn
down
then
the
man
in
the
doorway
struck
a
match
and
lit
his
cigar
the
light
showed
a
pale
face
with
keen
eyes
and
a
little
white
scar
near
his
right
eyebrow
his
scarfpin
was
a
large
diamond
oddly
set
twenty
years
ago
said
the
man
i
dined
here
at
brady
with
jimmy
wells
my
best
chum
and
the
finest
chap
in
the
world
he
and
i
were
raised
here
in
new
york
just
like
two
brothers
together
i
was
eighteen
and
jimmy
was
twenty
the
next
morning
i
was
to
start
for
the
west
to
make
my
fortune
you
could
have
dragged
jimmy
out
of
new
york
he
thought
it
was
the
only
place
on
earth
well
we
agreed
that
night
that
we
would
meet
here
again
exactly
twenty
years
from
that
date
and
time
no
matter
what
our
conditions
might
be
or
from
what
distance
we
might
have
to
come
we
figured
that
in
twenty
years
each
of
us
ought
to
have
our
destiny
worked
out
and
our
fortunes
made
whatever
they
were
going
to
be
it
sounds
pretty
interesting
said
the
policeman
rather
a
long
time
between
meets
though
it
seems
to
me
have
you
heard
from
your
friend
since
you
left
well
yes
for
a
time
we
corresponded
said
the
other
but
after
a
year
or
two
we
lost
track
of
each
other
you
see
the
west
is
a
pretty
big
proposition
and
i
kept
hustling
around
over
it
pretty
lively
but
i
know
jimmy
will
meet
me
here
if
he
alive
for
he
always
was
the
truest
stanchest
old
chap
in
the
world
he
never
forget
i
came
a
thousand
miles
to
stand
in
this
door
and
it
worth
it
if
my
old
partner
turns
up
the
waiting
man
pulled
out
a
handsome
watch
the
lids
of
it
set
with
small
diamonds
three
minutes
to
ten
he
announced
it
was
exactly
ten
when
we
parted
here
at
the
restaurant
door
did
pretty
well
out
west
did
you
asked
the
policeman
you
bet
i
hope
jimmy
has
done
half
as
well
he
was
a
kind
of
plodder
though
good
fellow
as
he
was
i
had
to
compete
with
some
of
the
sharpest
wits
going
to
get
my
pile
a
man
gets
in
a
groove
in
new
york
it
takes
the
west
to
put
a
on
him
the
policeman
twirled
his
club
and
took
a
step
or
two
i
be
on
my
way
hope
your
friend
comes
around
all
right
going
to
call
time
on
him
sharp
i
should
say
not
said
the
other
i
give
him
half
an
hour
at
least
if
jimmy
is
alive
on
earth
he
be
here
by
that
time
so
long
officer
sir
said
the
policeman
passing
on
along
his
beat
trying
doors
as
he
went
there
was
now
a
fine
cold
drizzle
falling
and
the
wind
had
risen
from
its
uncertain
puffs
into
a
steady
blow
the
few
foot
passengers
astir
in
that
quarter
hurried
dismally
and
silently
along
with
coat
collars
turned
high
and
pocketed
hands
and
in
the
door
of
the
hardware
store
the
man
who
had
come
a
thousand
miles
to
fill
an
appointment
uncertain
almost
to
absurdity
with
the
friend
of
his
youth
smoked
his
cigar
and
waited
about
twenty
minutes
he
waited
and
then
a
tall
man
in
a
long
overcoat
with
collar
turned
up
to
his
ears
hurried
across
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
he
went
directly
to
the
waiting
man
is
that
you
bob
he
asked
doubtfully
is
that
you
jimmy
wells
cried
the
man
in
the
door
bless
my
heart
exclaimed
the
new
arrival
grasping
both
the
hands
with
his
own
it
bob
sure
as
fate
i
was
certain
i
find
you
here
if
you
were
still
in
existence
well
well
well
twenty
years
is
a
long
time
the
old
restaurant
gone
bob
i
wish
it
had
lasted
so
we
could
have
had
another
dinner
there
how
has
the
west
treated
you
old
man
bully
it
has
given
me
everything
i
asked
it
for
you
changed
lots
jimmy
i
never
thought
you
were
so
tall
by
two
or
three
inches

grew
a
bit
after
i
was
twenty
doing
well
in
new
york

i
have
a
position
in
one
of
the
city
departments
come
on
bob
we
go
around
to
a
place
i
know
of
and
have
a
good
long
talk
about
old
times
the
two
men
started
up
the
street
arm
in
arm
the
man
from
the
west
his
egotism
enlarged
by
success
was
beginning
to
outline
the
history
of
his
career
the
other
submerged
in
his
overcoat
listened
with
interest
at
the
corner
stood
a
drug
store
brilliant
with
electric
lights
when
they
came
into
this
glare
each
of
them
turned
simultaneously
to
gaze
upon
the
other
face
the
man
from
the
west
stopped
suddenly
and
released
his
arm
you
not
jimmy
wells
he
snapped
twenty
years
is
a
long
time
but
not
long
enough
to
change
a
man
nose
from
a
roman
to
a
pug
it
sometimes
changes
a
good
man
into
a
bad
one
said
the
tall
man
you
been
under
arrest
for
ten
minutes
bob
chicago
thinks
you
may
have
dropped
over
our
way
and
wires
us
she
wants
to
have
a
chat
with
you
going
quietly
are
you
that
sensible
now
before
we
go
on
to
the
station
here
a
note
i
was
asked
to
hand
you
you
may
read
it
here
at
the
window
it
from
patrolman
wells
the
man
from
the
west
unfolded
the
little
piece
of
paper
handed
him
his
hand
was
steady
when
he
began
to
read
but
it
trembled
a
little
by
the
time
he
had
finished
the
note
was
rather
short
i
was
at
the
appointed
place
on
time
when
you
struck
the
match
to
light
your
cigar
i
saw
it
was
the
face
of
the
man
wanted
in
chicago
somehow
i
could
do
it
myself
so
i
went
around
and
got
a
plain
clothes
man
to
do
the
job
lost
on
dress
parade
mr
towers
chandler
was
pressing
his
evening
suit
in
his
hall
bedroom
one
iron
was
heating
on
a
small
gas
stove
the
other
was
being
pushed
vigorously
back
and
forth
to
make
the
desirable
crease
that
would
be
seen
later
on
extending
in
straight
lines
from
chandler
patent
leather
shoes
to
the
edge
of
his
vest
so
much
of
the
toilet
may
be
intrusted
to
our
confidence
the
remainder
may
be
guessed
by
those
whom
genteel
poverty
has
driven
to
ignoble
expedient
our
next
view
of
him
shall
be
as
he
descends
the
steps
of
his
immaculately
and
correctly
clothed
calm
assured
handsome
in
appearance
the
typical
new
york
young
clubman
setting
out
slightly
bored
to
inaugurate
the
pleasures
of
the
evening
chandler
honorarium
was
per
week
he
was
employed
in
the
office
of
an
architect
he
was
years
old
he
considered
architecture
to
be
truly
an
art
and
he
honestly
believed
though
he
would
not
have
dared
to
admit
it
in
new
york
that
the
flatiron
building
was
inferior
in
design
to
the
great
cathedral
in
milan
out
of
each
week
earnings
chandler
set
aside
at
the
end
of
each
ten
weeks
with
the
extra
capital
thus
accumulated
he
purchased
one
gentleman
evening
from
the
bargain
counter
of
stingy
old
father
time
he
arrayed
himself
in
the
regalia
of
millionaires
and
presidents
he
took
himself
to
the
quarter
where
life
is
brightest
and
showiest
and
there
dined
with
taste
and
luxury
with
ten
dollars
a
man
may
for
a
few
hours
play
the
wealthy
idler
to
perfection
the
sum
is
ample
for
a
meal
a
bottle
bearing
a
respectable
label
commensurate
tips
a
smoke
cab
fare
and
the
ordinary
etceteras
this
one
delectable
evening
culled
from
each
dull
seventy
was
to
chandler
a
source
of
renascent
bliss
to
the
society
bud
comes
but
one
début
it
stands
alone
sweet
in
her
memory
when
her
hair
has
whitened
but
to
chandler
each
ten
weeks
brought
a
joy
as
keen
as
thrilling
as
new
as
the
first
had
been
to
sit
among
under
palms
in
the
swirl
of
concealed
music
to
look
upon
the
of
such
a
paradise
and
to
be
looked
upon
by
them
what
is
a
girl
first
dance
and
tulle
compared
with
this
up
broadway
chandler
moved
with
the
vespertine
dress
parade
for
this
evening
he
was
an
exhibit
as
well
as
a
gazer
for
the
next
evenings
he
would
be
dining
in
cheviot
and
worsted
at
dubious
at
whirlwind
lunch
counters
on
sandwiches
and
beer
in
his
he
was
willing
to
do
that
for
he
was
a
true
son
of
the
great
city
of
and
to
him
one
evening
in
the
limelight
made
up
for
many
dark
ones
chandler
protracted
his
walk
until
the
forties
began
to
intersect
the
great
and
glittering
primrose
way
for
the
evening
was
yet
young
and
when
one
is
of
the
only
one
day
in
seventy
one
loves
to
protract
the
pleasure
eyes
bright
sinister
curious
admiring
provocative
alluring
were
bent
upon
him
for
his
garb
and
air
proclaimed
him
a
devotee
to
the
hour
of
solace
and
pleasure
at
a
certain
corner
he
came
to
a
standstill
proposing
to
himself
the
question
of
turning
back
toward
the
showy
and
fashionable
restaurant
in
which
he
usually
dined
on
the
evenings
of
his
especial
luxury
just
then
a
girl
scuddled
lightly
around
the
corner
slipped
on
a
patch
of
icy
snow
and
fell
plump
upon
the
sidewalk
chandler
assisted
her
to
her
feet
with
instant
and
solicitous
courtesy
the
girl
hobbled
to
the
wall
of
the
building
leaned
against
it
and
thanked
him
demurely
i
think
my
ankle
is
strained
she
said
it
twisted
when
i
fell
does
it
pain
you
much
inquired
chandler
only
when
i
rest
my
weight
upon
it
i
think
i
will
be
able
to
walk
in
a
minute
or
two
if
i
can
be
of
any
further
service
suggested
the
young
man
i
will
call
a
cab
or
thank
you
said
the
girl
softly
but
heartily
i
am
sure
you
need
not
trouble
yourself
any
further
it
was
so
awkward
of
me
and
my
shoe
heels
are
horridly
i
ca
blame
them
at
all
chandler
looked
at
the
girl
and
found
her
swiftly
drawing
his
interest
she
was
pretty
in
a
refined
way
and
her
eye
was
both
merry
and
kind
she
was
inexpensively
clothed
in
a
plain
black
dress
that
suggested
a
sort
of
uniform
such
as
shop
girls
wear
her
glossy
hair
showed
its
coils
beneath
a
cheap
hat
of
black
straw
whose
only
ornament
was
a
velvet
ribbon
and
bow
she
could
have
posed
as
a
model
for
the
working
girl
of
the
best
type
a
sudden
idea
came
into
the
head
of
the
young
architect
he
would
ask
this
girl
to
dine
with
him
here
was
the
element
that
his
splendid
but
solitary
periodic
feasts
had
lacked
his
brief
season
of
elegant
luxury
would
be
doubly
enjoyable
if
he
could
add
to
it
a
lady
society
this
girl
was
a
lady
he
was
sure
her
manner
and
speech
settled
that
and
in
spite
of
her
extremely
plain
attire
he
felt
that
he
would
be
pleased
to
sit
at
table
with
her
these
thoughts
passed
swiftly
through
his
mind
and
he
decided
to
ask
her
it
was
a
breach
of
etiquette
of
course
but
oftentimes
girls
waived
formalities
in
matters
of
this
kind
they
were
generally
shrewd
judges
of
men
and
thought
better
of
their
own
judgment
than
they
did
of
useless
conventions
his
ten
dollars
discreetly
expended
would
enable
the
two
to
dine
very
well
indeed
the
dinner
would
no
doubt
be
a
wonderful
experience
thrown
into
the
dull
routine
of
the
girl
life
and
her
lively
appreciation
of
it
would
add
to
his
own
triumph
and
pleasure
i
think
he
said
to
her
with
frank
gravity
that
your
foot
needs
a
longer
rest
than
you
suppose
now
i
am
going
to
suggest
a
way
in
which
you
can
give
it
that
and
at
the
same
time
do
me
a
favour
i
was
on
my
way
to
dine
all
by
my
lonely
self
when
you
came
tumbling
around
the
corner
you
come
with
me
and
we
have
a
cozy
dinner
and
a
pleasant
talk
together
and
by
that
time
your
game
ankle
will
carry
you
home
very
nicely
i
am
sure
the
girl
looked
quickly
up
into
chandler
clear
pleasant
countenance
her
eyes
twinkled
once
very
brightly
and
then
she
smiled
ingenuously
but
we
do
know
each
other
it
would
be
right
would
it
she
said
doubtfully
there
is
nothing
wrong
about
it
said
the
young
man
candidly
introduce
myself
permit
me
mr
towers
chandler
after
our
dinner
which
i
will
try
to
make
as
pleasant
as
possible
i
will
bid
you
or
attend
you
safely
to
your
door
whichever
you
prefer
but
dear
me
said
the
girl
with
a
glance
at
chandler
faultless
attire
in
this
old
dress
and
hat
never
mind
that
said
chandler
cheerfully
i
sure
you
look
more
charming
in
them
than
any
one
we
shall
see
in
the
most
elaborate
dinner
toilette
my
ankle
does
hurt
yet
admitted
the
girl
attempting
a
limping
step
i
think
i
will
accept
your
invitation
chandler
you
may
call
me
miss
marian
come
then
miss
marian
said
the
young
architect
gaily
but
with
perfect
courtesy
you
will
not
have
far
to
walk
there
is
a
very
respectable
and
good
restaurant
in
the
next
block
you
will
have
to
lean
on
my
arm
so
and
walk
slowly
it
is
lonely
dining
all
by
one
self
i
just
a
little
bit
glad
that
you
slipped
on
the
ice
when
the
two
were
established
at
a
table
with
a
promising
waiter
hovering
in
attendance
chandler
began
to
experience
the
real
joy
that
his
regular
outing
always
brought
to
him
the
restaurant
was
not
so
showy
or
pretentious
as
the
one
further
down
broadway
which
he
always
preferred
but
it
was
nearly
so
the
tables
were
well
filled
with
diners
there
was
a
good
orchestra
playing
softly
enough
to
make
conversation
a
possible
pleasure
and
the
cuisine
and
service
were
beyond
criticism
his
companion
even
in
her
cheap
hat
and
dress
held
herself
with
an
air
that
added
distinction
to
the
natural
beauty
of
her
face
and
figure
and
it
is
certain
that
she
looked
at
chandler
with
his
animated
but
manner
and
his
kindling
and
frank
blue
eyes
with
something
not
far
from
admiration
in
her
own
charming
face
then
it
was
that
the
madness
of
manhattan
the
frenzy
of
fuss
and
feathers
the
bacillus
of
brag
the
provincial
plague
of
pose
seized
upon
towers
chandler
he
was
on
broadway
surrounded
by
pomp
and
style
and
there
were
eyes
to
look
at
him
on
the
stage
of
that
comedy
he
had
assumed
to
play
the
part
of
a
butterfly
of
fashion
and
an
idler
of
means
and
taste
he
was
dressed
for
the
part
and
all
his
good
angels
had
not
the
power
to
prevent
him
from
acting
it
so
he
began
to
prate
to
miss
marian
of
clubs
of
teas
of
golf
and
riding
and
kennels
and
cotillions
and
tours
abroad
and
threw
out
hints
of
a
yacht
lying
at
larchmont
he
could
see
that
she
was
vastly
impressed
by
this
vague
talk
so
he
endorsed
his
pose
by
random
insinuations
concerning
great
wealth
and
mentioned
familiarly
a
few
names
that
are
handled
reverently
by
the
proletariat
it
was
short
little
day
and
he
was
wringing
from
it
the
best
that
could
be
had
as
he
saw
it
and
yet
once
or
twice
he
saw
the
pure
gold
of
this
girl
shine
through
the
mist
that
his
egotism
had
raised
between
him
and
all
objects
this
way
of
living
that
you
speak
of
she
said
sounds
so
futile
and
purposeless
have
you
any
work
to
do
in
the
world
that
might
interest
you
more
my
dear
miss
marian
he
exclaimed
work
think
of
dressing
every
day
for
dinner
of
making
half
a
dozen
calls
in
an
afternoon
with
a
policeman
at
every
corner
ready
to
jump
into
your
auto
and
take
you
to
the
station
if
you
get
up
any
greater
speed
than
a
donkey
cart
gait
we
are
the
hardest
workers
in
the
land
the
dinner
was
concluded
the
waiter
generously
fed
and
the
two
walked
out
to
the
corner
where
they
had
met
miss
marian
walked
very
well
now
her
limp
was
scarcely
noticeable
thank
you
for
a
nice
time
she
said
frankly
i
must
run
home
now
i
liked
the
dinner
very
much
mr
chandler
he
shook
hands
with
her
smiling
cordially
and
said
something
about
a
game
of
bridge
at
his
club
he
watched
her
for
a
moment
walking
rather
rapidly
eastward
and
then
he
found
a
cab
to
drive
him
slowly
homeward
in
his
chilly
bedroom
chandler
laid
away
his
evening
clothes
for
a
days
rest
he
went
about
it
thoughtfully
that
was
a
stunning
girl
he
said
to
himself
she
all
right
too
i
be
sworn
even
if
she
does
have
to
work
perhaps
if
i
told
her
the
truth
instead
of
all
that
we
might
but
confound
it
i
had
to
play
up
to
my
clothes
thus
spoke
the
brave
who
was
born
and
reared
in
the
wigwams
of
the
tribe
of
the
manhattans
the
girl
after
leaving
her
entertainer
sped
swiftly
until
she
arrived
at
a
handsome
and
sedate
mansion
two
squares
to
the
east
facing
on
that
avenue
which
is
the
highway
of
mammon
and
the
auxiliary
gods
here
she
entered
hurriedly
and
ascended
to
a
room
where
a
handsome
young
lady
in
an
elaborate
house
dress
was
looking
anxiously
out
the
window
oh
you
madcap
exclaimed
the
elder
girl
when
the
other
entered
when
will
you
quit
frightening
us
this
way
it
is
two
hours
since
you
ran
out
in
that
rag
of
an
old
dress
and
marie
hat
mamma
has
been
so
alarmed
she
sent
louis
in
the
auto
to
try
to
find
you
you
are
a
bad
thoughtless
puss
the
elder
girl
touched
a
button
and
a
maid
came
in
a
moment
marie
tell
mamma
that
miss
marian
has
returned
do
scold
sister
i
only
ran
down
to
mme
theo
to
tell
her
to
use
mauve
insertion
instead
of
pink
my
costume
and
marie
hat
were
just
what
i
needed
every
one
thought
i
was
a
shopgirl
i
am
sure
dinner
is
over
dear
you
stayed
so
late
i
know
i
slipped
on
the
sidewalk
and
turned
my
ankle
i
could
not
walk
so
i
hobbled
into
a
restaurant
and
sat
there
until
i
was
better
that
is
why
i
was
so
long
the
two
girls
sat
in
the
window
seat
looking
out
at
the
lights
and
the
stream
of
hurrying
vehicles
in
the
avenue
the
younger
one
cuddled
down
with
her
head
in
her
sister
lap
we
will
have
to
marry
some
day
she
said
dreamily
both
of
us
we
have
so
much
money
that
we
will
not
be
allowed
to
disappoint
the
public
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
the
kind
of
a
man
i
could
love
sis
go
on
you
scatterbrain
smiled
the
other
i
could
love
a
man
with
dark
and
kind
blue
eyes
who
is
gentle
and
respectful
to
poor
girls
who
is
handsome
and
good
and
does
not
try
to
flirt
but
i
could
love
him
only
if
he
had
an
ambition
an
object
some
work
to
do
in
the
world
i
would
not
care
how
poor
he
was
if
i
could
help
him
build
his
way
up
but
sister
dear
the
kind
of
man
we
always
meet
the
man
who
lives
an
idle
life
between
society
and
his
clubs
i
could
not
love
a
man
like
that
even
if
his
eyes
were
blue
and
he
were
ever
so
kind
to
poor
girls
whom
he
met
in
the
street
by
courier
it
was
neither
the
season
nor
the
hour
when
the
park
had
frequenters
and
it
is
likely
that
the
young
lady
who
was
seated
on
one
of
the
benches
at
the
side
of
the
walk
had
merely
obeyed
a
sudden
impulse
to
sit
for
a
while
and
enjoy
a
foretaste
of
coming
spring
she
rested
there
pensive
and
still
a
certain
melancholy
that
touched
her
countenance
must
have
been
of
recent
birth
for
it
had
not
yet
altered
the
fine
and
youthful
contours
of
her
cheek
nor
subdued
the
arch
though
resolute
curve
of
her
lips
a
tall
young
man
came
striding
through
the
park
along
the
path
near
which
she
sat
behind
him
tagged
a
boy
carrying
a
at
sight
of
the
young
lady
the
man
face
changed
to
red
and
back
to
pale
again
he
watched
her
countenance
as
he
drew
nearer
with
hope
and
anxiety
mingled
on
his
own
he
passed
within
a
few
yards
of
her
but
he
saw
no
evidence
that
she
was
aware
of
his
presence
or
existence
some
fifty
yards
further
on
he
suddenly
stopped
and
sat
on
a
bench
at
one
side
the
boy
dropped
the
and
stared
at
him
with
wondering
shrewd
eyes
the
young
man
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
wiped
his
brow
it
was
a
good
handkerchief
a
good
brow
and
the
young
man
was
good
to
look
at
he
said
to
the
boy
i
want
you
to
take
a
message
to
that
young
lady
on
that
bench
tell
her
i
am
on
my
way
to
the
station
to
leave
for
san
francisco
where
i
shall
join
that
alaska
expedition
tell
her
that
since
she
has
commanded
me
neither
to
speak
nor
to
write
to
her
i
take
this
means
of
making
one
last
appeal
to
her
sense
of
justice
for
the
sake
of
what
has
been
tell
her
that
to
condemn
and
discard
one
who
has
not
deserved
such
treatment
without
giving
him
her
reasons
or
a
chance
to
explain
is
contrary
to
her
nature
as
i
believe
it
to
be
tell
her
that
i
have
thus
to
a
certain
degree
disobeyed
her
injunctions
in
the
hope
that
she
may
yet
be
inclined
to
see
justice
done
go
and
tell
her
that
the
young
man
dropped
a
into
the
boy
hand
the
boy
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
with
bright
canny
eyes
out
of
a
dirty
intelligent
face
and
then
set
off
at
a
run
he
approached
the
lady
on
the
bench
a
little
doubtfully
but
unembarrassed
he
touched
the
brim
of
the
old
plaid
bicycle
cap
perched
on
the
back
of
his
head
the
lady
looked
at
him
coolly
without
prejudice
or
favour
lady
he
said
dat
gent
on
de
oder
bench
sent
yer
a
song
and
dance
by
me
if
yer
do
know
de
guy
and
he
tryin
to
do
de
johnny
act
say
de
word
and
i
call
a
cop
in
minutes
if
yer
does
know
him
and
he
on
de
square
i
spiel
yer
de
bunch
of
hot
air
he
sent
yer
the
young
lady
betrayed
a
faint
interest
a
song
and
dance
she
said
in
a
deliberate
sweet
voice
that
seemed
to
clothe
her
words
in
a
diaphanous
garment
of
impalpable
irony
a
new
idea
in
the
troubadour
line
i
suppose
i
used
to
know
the
gentleman
who
sent
you
so
i
think
it
will
hardly
be
necessary
to
call
the
police
you
may
execute
your
song
and
dance
but
do
not
sing
too
loudly
it
is
a
little
early
yet
for
vaudeville
and
we
might
attract
attention
awe
said
the
boy
with
a
shrug
down
the
length
of
him
yer
know
what
i
mean
lady
a
turn
it
wind
he
told
me
to
tell
yer
he
got
his
collars
and
cuffs
in
dat
grip
for
a
scoot
clean
out
to
den
he
goin
to
shoot
in
de
klondike
he
says
yer
told
him
not
to
send
no
more
pink
notes
nor
come
hangin
over
de
garden
gate
and
he
takes
dis
means
of
puttin
yer
wise
he
says
yer
refereed
him
out
like
a
and
never
give
him
no
chance
to
kick
at
de
decision
he
says
yer
swiped
him
and
never
said
why
the
slightly
awakened
interest
in
the
young
lady
eyes
did
not
abate
perhaps
it
was
caused
by
either
the
originality
or
the
audacity
of
the
hunter
in
thus
circumventing
her
express
commands
against
the
ordinary
modes
of
communication
she
fixed
her
eye
on
a
statue
standing
disconsolate
in
the
dishevelled
park
and
spoke
into
the
transmitter
tell
the
gentleman
that
i
need
not
repeat
to
him
a
description
of
my
ideals
he
knows
what
they
have
been
and
what
they
still
are
so
far
as
they
touch
on
this
case
absolute
loyalty
and
truth
are
the
ones
paramount
tell
him
that
i
have
studied
my
own
heart
as
well
as
one
can
and
i
know
its
weakness
as
well
as
i
do
its
needs
that
is
why
i
decline
to
hear
his
pleas
whatever
they
may
be
i
did
not
condemn
him
through
hearsay
or
doubtful
evidence
and
that
is
why
i
made
no
charge
but
since
he
persists
in
hearing
what
he
already
well
knows
you
may
convey
the
matter
tell
him
that
i
entered
the
conservatory
that
evening
from
the
rear
to
cut
a
rose
for
my
mother
tell
him
i
saw
him
and
miss
ashburton
beneath
the
pink
oleander
the
tableau
was
pretty
but
the
pose
and
juxtaposition
were
too
eloquent
and
evident
to
require
explanation
i
left
the
conservatory
and
at
the
same
time
the
rose
and
my
ideal
you
may
carry
that
song
and
dance
to
your
impresario
i
shy
on
one
word
lady
jux
jux
put
me
wise
on
dat
will
yer
juxtaposition
or
you
may
call
it
propinquity
or
if
you
like
being
rather
too
near
for
one
maintaining
the
position
of
an
ideal
the
gravel
spun
from
beneath
the
boy
feet
he
stood
by
the
other
bench
the
man
eyes
interrogated
him
hungrily
the
boy
were
shining
with
the
impersonal
zeal
of
the
translator

the
young
man
gave
a
low
whistle
and
his
eyes
flashed
with
a
sudden
thought
his
hand
flew
to
the
inside
pocket
of
his
coat
and
drew
out
a
handful
of
letters
selecting
one
he
handed
it
to
the
boy

with
a
silver
dollar
from

trust
with
her
conception

heartache
might
have
been
avoided

the
young

doubtfully
and
read
it
dear

i
want
to
thank
you
for
your
most
kind
and
opportune
aid
to
my
daughter
last
friday
evening
when
she
was
overcome
by
an
attack
of
her
old
in
the
conservatory
at
waldron
reception

not
been
near

catch
her
as

attention

robert
ashburton
the
young
lady
refolded
the
letter
and
handed
it
to
the
boy
de
gent
wants
an
answer
said
the
messenger
wot
de
word
the
lady
eyes
suddenly
flashed
on
him
bright
smiling
and
wet
tell
that
guy
on
the
other
bench
she
said
with
a
happy
tremulous
laugh
that
his
girl
wants
him
the
furnished
room
restless
shifting
fugacious
as
time
itself
is
a
certain
vast
bulk
of
the
population
of
the
red
brick
district
of
the
lower
west
side
homeless
they
have
a
hundred
homes
they
flit
from
furnished
room
to
furnished
room
transients
forever
transients
in
abode
transients
in
heart
and
mind
they
sing
home
sweet
home
in
ragtime
they
carry
their
et
in
a
bandbox
their
vine
is
entwined
about
a
picture
hat
a
rubber
plant
is
their
fig
tree
hence
the
houses
of
this
district
having
had
a
thousand
dwellers
should
have
a
thousand
tales
to
tell
mostly
dull
ones
no
doubt
but
it
would
be
strange
if
there
could
not
be
found
a
ghost
or
two
in
the
wake
of
all
these
vagrant
guests
one
evening
after
dark
a
young
man
prowled
among
these
crumbling
red
mansions
ringing
their
bells
at
the
twelfth
he
rested
his
lean
upon
the
step
and
wiped
the
dust
from
his
hatband
and
forehead
the
bell
sounded
faint
and
far
away
in
some
remote
hollow
depths
to
the
door
of
this
the
twelfth
house
whose
bell
he
had
rung
came
a
housekeeper
who
made
him
think
of
an
unwholesome
surfeited
worm
that
had
eaten
its
nut
to
a
hollow
shell
and
now
sought
to
fill
the
vacancy
with
edible
lodgers
he
asked
if
there
was
a
room
to
let
come
in
said
the
housekeeper
her
voice
came
from
her
throat
her
throat
seemed
lined
with
fur
i
have
the
third
floor
back
vacant
since
a
week
back
should
you
wish
to
look
at
it
the
young
man
followed
her
up
the
stairs
a
faint
light
from
no
particular
source
mitigated
the
shadows
of
the
halls
they
trod
noiselessly
upon
a
stair
carpet
that
its
own
loom
would
have
forsworn
it
seemed
to
have
become
vegetable
to
have
degenerated
in
that
rank
sunless
air
to
lush
lichen
or
spreading
moss
that
grew
in
patches
to
the
staircase
and
was
viscid
under
the
foot
like
organic
matter
at
each
turn
of
the
stairs
were
vacant
niches
in
the
wall
perhaps
plants
had
once
been
set
within
them
if
so
they
had
died
in
that
foul
and
tainted
air
it
may
be
that
statues
of
the
saints
had
stood
there
but
it
was
not
difficult
to
conceive
that
imps
and
devils
had
dragged
them
forth
in
the
darkness
and
down
to
the
unholy
depths
of
some
furnished
pit
below
this
is
the
room
said
the
housekeeper
from
her
furry
throat
it
a
nice
room
it
ai
often
vacant
i
had
some
most
elegant
people
in
it
last
summer
no
trouble
at
all
and
paid
in
advance
to
the
minute
the
water
at
the
end
of
the
hall
sprowls
and
mooney
kept
it
three
months
they
done
a
vaudeville
sketch
miss
sprowls
you
may
have
heard
of
her
oh
that
was
just
the
stage
names
right
there
over
the
dresser
is
where
the
marriage
certificate
hung
framed
the
gas
is
here
and
you
see
there
is
plenty
of
closet
room
it
a
room
everybody
likes
it
never
stays
idle
long
do
you
have
many
theatrical
people
rooming
here
asked
the
young
man
they
comes
and
goes
a
good
proportion
of
my
lodgers
is
connected
with
the
theatres
yes
sir
this
is
the
theatrical
district
actor
people
never
stays
long
anywhere
i
get
my
share
yes
they
comes
and
they
goes
he
engaged
the
room
paying
for
a
week
in
advance
he
was
tired
he
said
and
would
take
possession
at
once
he
counted
out
the
money
the
room
had
been
made
ready
she
said
even
to
towels
and
water
as
the
housekeeper
moved
away
he
put
for
the
thousandth
time
the
question
that
he
carried
at
the
end
of
his
tongue
a
young
girl
miss
vashner
miss
eloise
vashner
do
you
remember
such
a
one
among
your
lodgers
she
would
be
singing
on
the
stage
most
likely
a
fair
girl
of
medium
height
and
slender
with
reddish
gold
hair
and
a
dark
mole
near
her
left
eyebrow
no
i
do
remember
the
name
them
stage
people
has
names
they
change
as
often
as
their
rooms
they
comes
and
they
goes
no
i
do
call
that
one
to
mind
no
always
no
five
months
of
ceaseless
interrogation
and
the
inevitable
negative
so
much
time
spent
by
day
in
questioning
managers
agents
schools
and
choruses
by
night
among
the
audiences
of
theatres
from
casts
down
to
music
halls
so
low
that
he
dreaded
to
find
what
he
most
hoped
for
he
who
had
loved
her
best
had
tried
to
find
her
he
was
sure
that
since
her
disappearance
from
home
this
great
city
held
her
somewhere
but
it
was
like
a
monstrous
quicksand
shifting
its
particles
constantly
with
no
foundation
its
upper
granules
of
buried
in
ooze
and
slime
the
furnished
room
received
its
latest
guest
with
a
first
glow
of
a
hectic
haggard
perfunctory
welcome
like
the
specious
smile
of
a
demirep
the
sophistical
comfort
came
in
reflected
gleams
from
the
decayed
furniture
the
ragged
brocade
upholstery
of
a
couch
and
two
chairs
a
cheap
pier
glass
between
the
two
windows
from
one
or
two
gilt
picture
frames
and
a
brass
bedstead
in
a
corner
the
guest
reclined
inert
upon
a
chair
while
the
room
confused
in
speech
as
though
it
were
an
apartment
in
babel
tried
to
discourse
to
him
of
its
divers
tenantry
a
polychromatic
rug
like
some
rectangular
tropical
islet
lay
surrounded
by
a
billowy
sea
of
soiled
matting
upon
the
wall
were
those
pictures
that
pursue
the
homeless
one
from
house
to
house
the
huguenot
lovers
the
first
quarrel
the
wedding
breakfast
psyche
at
the
fountain
the
mantel
chastely
severe
outline
was
ingloriously
veiled
behind
some
pert
drapery
drawn
rakishly
askew
like
the
sashes
of
the
amazonian
ballet
upon
it
was
some
desolate
flotsam
cast
aside
by
the
room
marooned
when
a
lucky
sail
had
borne
them
to
a
fresh
port
a
trifling
vase
or
two
pictures
of
actresses
a
medicine
bottle
some
stray
cards
out
of
a
deck
one
by
one
as
the
characters
of
a
cryptograph
become
explicit
the
little
signs
left
by
the
furnished
room
procession
of
guests
developed
a
significance
the
threadbare
space
in
the
rug
in
front
of
the
dresser
told
that
lovely
woman
had
marched
in
the
throng
tiny
finger
prints
on
the
wall
spoke
of
little
prisoners
trying
to
feel
their
way
to
sun
and
air
a
splattered
stain
raying
like
the
shadow
of
a
bursting
bomb
witnessed
where
a
hurled
glass
or
bottle
had
splintered
with
its
contents
against
the
wall
across
the
pier
glass
had
been
scrawled
with
a
diamond
in
staggering
letters
the
name
marie
it
seemed
that
the
succession
of
dwellers
in
the
furnished
room
had
turned
in
fury
perhaps
tempted
beyond
forbearance
by
its
garish
coldness
and
wreaked
upon
it
their
passions
the
furniture
was
chipped
and
bruised
the
couch
distorted
by
bursting
springs
seemed
a
horrible
monster
that
had
been
slain
during
the
stress
of
some
grotesque
convulsion
some
more
potent
upheaval
had
cloven
a
great
slice
from
the
marble
mantel
each
plank
in
the
floor
owned
its
particular
cant
and
shriek
as
from
a
separate
and
individual
agony
it
seemed
incredible
that
all
this
malice
and
injury
had
been
wrought
upon
the
room
by
those
who
had
called
it
for
a
time
their
home
and
yet
it
may
have
been
the
cheated
home
instinct
surviving
blindly
the
resentful
rage
at
false
household
gods
that
had
kindled
their
wrath
a
hut
that
is
our
own
we
can
sweep
and
adorn
and
cherish
the
young
tenant
in
the
chair
allowed
these
thoughts
to
file
through
his
mind
while
there
drifted
into
the
room
furnished
sounds
and
furnished
scents
he
heard
in
one
room
a
tittering
and
incontinent
slack
laughter
in
others
the
monologue
of
a
scold
the
rattling
of
dice
a
lullaby
and
one
crying
dully
above
him
a
banjo
tinkled
with
spirit
doors
banged
somewhere
the
elevated
trains
roared
intermittently
a
cat
yowled
miserably
upon
a
back
fence
and
he
breathed
the
breath
of
the
house
a
dank
savour
rather
than
a
smell
a
cold
musty
effluvium
as
from
underground
vaults
mingled
with
the
reeking
exhalations
of
linoleum
and
mildewed
and
rotten
woodwork
then
suddenly
as
he
rested
there
the
room
was
filled
with
the
strong
sweet
odour
of
mignonette
it
came
as
upon
a
single
buffet
of
wind
with
such
sureness
and
fragrance
and
emphasis
that
it
almost
seemed
a
living
visitant
and
the
man
cried
aloud
what
dear
as
if
he
had
been
called
and
sprang
up
and
faced
about
the
rich
odour
clung
to
him
and
wrapped
him
around
he
reached
out
his
arms
for
it
all
his
senses
for
the
time
confused
and
commingled
how
could
one
be
peremptorily
called
by
an
odour
surely
it
must
have
been
a
sound
but
was
it
not
the
sound
that
had
touched
that
had
caressed
him
she
has
been
in
this
room
he
cried
and
he
sprang
to
wrest
from
it
a
token
for
he
knew
he
would
recognize
the
smallest
thing
that
had
belonged
to
her
or
that
she
had
touched
this
enveloping
scent
of
mignonette
the
odour
that
she
had
loved
and
made
her
own
whence
came
it
the
room
had
been
but
carelessly
set
in
order
scattered
upon
the
flimsy
dresser
scarf
were
half
a
dozen
hairpins
those
discreet
indistinguishable
friends
of
womankind
feminine
of
gender
infinite
of
mood
and
uncommunicative
of
tense
these
he
ignored
conscious
of
their
triumphant
lack
of
identity
ransacking
the
drawers
of
the
dresser
he
came
upon
a
discarded
tiny
ragged
handkerchief
he
pressed
it
to
his
face
it
was
racy
and
insolent
with
heliotrope
he
hurled
it
to
the
floor
in
another
drawer
he
found
odd
buttons
a
theatre
programme
a
pawnbroker
card
two
lost
marshmallows
a
book
on
the
divination
of
dreams
in
the
last
was
a
woman
black
satin
hair
bow
which
halted
him
poised
between
ice
and
fire
but
the
black
satin
also
is
femininity
demure
impersonal
common
ornament
and
tells
no
tales
and
then
he
traversed
the
room
like
a
hound
on
the
scent
skimming
the
walls
considering
the
corners
of
the
bulging
matting
on
his
hands
and
knees
rummaging
mantel
and
tables
the
curtains
and
hangings
the
drunken
cabinet
in
the
corner
for
a
visible
sign
unable
to
perceive
that
she
was
there
beside
around
against
within
above
him
clinging
to
him
wooing
him
calling
him
so
poignantly
through
the
finer
senses
that
even
his
grosser
ones
became
cognisant
of
the
call
once
again
he
answered
loudly
yes
dear
and
turned
to
gaze
on
vacancy
for
he
could
not
yet
discern
form
and
colour
and
love
and
outstretched
arms
in
the
odour
of
mignonette
oh
god
whence
that
odour
and
since
when
have
odours
had
a
voice
to
call
thus
he
groped
he
burrowed
in
crevices
and
corners
and
found
corks
and
cigarettes
these
he
passed
in
passive
contempt
but
once
he
found
in
a
fold
of
the
matting
a
cigar
and
this
he
ground
beneath
his
heel
with
a
green
and
trenchant
oath
he
sifted
the
room
from
end
to
end
he
found
dreary
and
ignoble
small
records
of
many
a
peripatetic
tenant
but
of
her
whom
he
sought
and
who
may
have
lodged
there
and
whose
spirit
seemed
to
hover
there
he
found
no
trace
and
then
he
thought
of
the
housekeeper
he
ran
from
the
haunted
room
downstairs
and
to
a
door
that
showed
a
crack
of
light
she
came
out
to
his
knock
he
smothered
his
excitement
as
best
he
could
will
you
tell
me
madam
he
besought
her
who
occupied
the
room
i
have
before
i
came
yes
sir
i
can
tell
you
again
was
sprowls
and
mooney
as
i
said
miss
sprowls
it
was
in
the
theatres
but
missis
mooney
she
was
my
house
is
well
known
for
respectability
the
marriage
certificate
hung
framed
on
a
nail
over
what
kind
of
a
lady
was
miss
sprowls
in
looks
i
mean
why
sir
short
and
stout
with
a
comical
face
they
left
a
week
ago
tuesday
and
before
they
occupied
it
why
there
was
a
single
gentleman
connected
with
the
draying
business
he
left
owing
me
a
week
before
him
was
missis
crowder
and
her
two
children
that
stayed
four
months
and
back
of
them
was
old
doyle
whose
sons
paid
for
him
he
kept
the
room
six
months
that
goes
back
a
year
sir
and
further
i
do
not
remember
he
thanked
her
and
crept
back
to
his
room
the
room
was
dead
the
essence
that
had
vivified
it
was
gone
the
perfume
of
mignonette
had
departed
in
its
place
was
the
old
stale
odour
of
mouldy
house
furniture
of
atmosphere
in
storage
the
ebbing
of
his
hope
drained
his
faith
he
sat
staring
at
the
yellow
singing
gaslight
soon
he
walked
to
the
bed
and
began
to
tear
the
sheets
into
strips
with
the
blade
of
his
knife
he
drove
them
tightly
into
every
crevice
around
windows
and
door
when
all
was
snug
and
taut
he
turned
out
the
light
turned
the
gas
full
on
again
and
laid
himself
gratefully
upon
the
bed
it
was
mccool
night
to
go
with
the
can
for
beer
so
she
fetched
it
and
sat
with
purdy
in
one
of
those
subterranean
retreats
where
foregather
and
the
worm
dieth
seldom
i
rented
out
my
third
floor
back

evening

purdy
across

fine
circle
of
foam

young

went
up
to
bed

hours
ago

intense
admiration

wonder

she

in
a
husky
whisper
laden
with
mystery

do

again
mrs
mccool
the
brief
début
of
tildy
if
you
do
not
know
bogle
chop
house
and
family
restaurant
it
is
your
loss
for
if
you
are
one
of
the
fortunate
ones
who
dine
expensively
you
should
be
interested
to
know
how
the
other
half
consumes
provisions
and
if
you
belong
to
the
half
to
whom
waiters
checks
are
things
of
moment
you
should
know
bogle
for
there
you
get
your
money
worth
in
quantity
at
least
bogle
is
situated
in
that
highway
of
that
boulevard
of
eighth
avenue
there
are
two
rows
of
tables
in
the
room
six
in
each
row
on
each
table
is
a
containing
cruets
of
condiments
and
seasons
from
the
pepper
cruet
you
may
shake
a
cloud
of
something
tasteless
and
melancholy
like
volcanic
dust
from
the
salt
cruet
you
may
expect
nothing
though
a
man
should
extract
a
sanguinary
stream
from
the
pallid
turnip
yet
will
his
prowess
be
balked
when
he
comes
to
wrest
salt
from
bogle
cruets
also
upon
each
table
stands
the
counterfeit
of
that
benign
sauce
made
from
the
recipe
of
a
nobleman
in
india
at
the
cashier
desk
sits
bogle
cold
sordid
slow
smouldering
and
takes
your
money
behind
a
mountain
of
toothpicks
he
makes
your
change
files
your
check
and
ejects
at
you
like
a
toad
a
word
about
the
weather
beyond
a
corroboration
of
his
meteorological
statement
you
would
better
not
venture
you
are
not
bogle
friend
you
are
a
fed
transient
customer
and
you
and
he
may
not
meet
again
until
the
blowing
of
gabriel
dinner
horn
so
take
your
change
and
go
to
the
devil
if
you
like
there
you
have
bogle
sentiments
the
needs
of
bogle
customers
were
supplied
by
two
waitresses
and
a
voice
one
of
the
waitresses
was
named
aileen
she
was
tall
beautiful
lively
gracious
and
learned
in
persiflage
her
other
name
there
was
no
more
necessity
for
another
name
at
bogle
than
there
was
for
the
name
of
the
other
waitress
was
tildy
why
do
you
suggest
matilda
please
listen
this
time
tildy
tildy
tildy
was
dumpy
and
too
anxious
to
please
to
please
repeat
the
last
clause
to
yourself
once
or
twice
and
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
duplicate
infinite
the
voice
at
bogle
was
invisible
it
came
from
the
kitchen
and
did
not
shine
in
the
way
of
originality
it
was
a
heathen
voice
and
contented
itself
with
vain
repetitions
of
exclamations
emitted
by
the
waitresses
concerning
food
will
it
tire
you
to
be
told
again
that
aileen
was
beautiful
had
she
donned
a
few
hundred
dollars
worth
of
clothes
and
joined
the
easter
parade
and
had
you
seen
her
you
would
have
hastened
to
say
so
yourself
the
customers
at
bogle
were
her
slaves
six
tables
full
she
could
wait
upon
at
once
they
who
were
in
a
hurry
restrained
their
impatience
for
the
joy
of
merely
gazing
upon
her
swiftly
moving
graceful
figure
they
who
had
finished
eating
ate
more
that
they
might
continue
in
the
light
of
her
smiles
every
man
there
and
they
were
mostly
men
tried
to
make
his
impression
upon
her
aileen
could
successfully
exchange
repartee
against
a
dozen
at
once
and
every
smile
that
she
sent
forth
lodged
like
pellets
from
a
in
as
many
hearts
and
all
this
while
she
would
be
performing
astounding
feats
with
orders
of
pork
and
beans
pot
roasts
and
any
quantity
of
things
on
the
iron
and
in
the
pan
and
straight
up
and
on
the
side
with
all
this
feasting
and
flirting
and
merry
exchange
of
wit
bogle
came
mighty
near
being
a
salon
with
aileen
for
its
madame
récamier
if
the
transients
were
entranced
by
the
fascinating
aileen
the
regulars
were
her
adorers
there
was
much
rivalry
among
many
of
the
steady
customers
aileen
could
have
had
an
engagement
every
evening
at
least
twice
a
week
some
one
took
her
to
a
theatre
or
to
a
dance
one
stout
gentleman
whom
she
and
tildy
had
privately
christened
the
hog
presented
her
with
a
turquoise
ring
another
one
known
as
freshy
who
rode
on
the
traction
company
repair
wagon
was
going
to
give
her
a
poodle
as
soon
as
his
brother
got
the
hauling
contract
in
the
ninth
and
the
man
who
always
ate
spareribs
and
spinach
and
said
he
was
a
stock
broker
asked
her
to
go
to
parsifal
with
him
i
do
know
where
this
place
is
said
aileen
while
talking
it
over
with
tildy
but
the
got
to
be
on
before
i
put
a
stitch
into
a
travelling
dress
ai
that
right
well
i
guess
but
tildy
in
steaming
chattering
bogle
there
was
almost
a
heart
tragedy
tildy
with
the
blunt
nose
the
hair
the
freckled
skin
the
figure
had
never
had
an
admirer
not
a
man
followed
her
with
his
eyes
when
she
went
to
and
fro
in
the
restaurant
save
now
and
then
when
they
glared
with
the
for
food
none
of
them
bantered
her
gaily
to
coquettish
interchanges
of
wit
none
of
them
loudly
jollied
her
of
mornings
as
they
did
aileen
accusing
her
when
the
eggs
were
slow
in
coming
of
late
hours
in
the
company
of
envied
swains
no
one
had
ever
given
her
a
turquoise
ring
or
invited
her
upon
a
voyage
to
mysterious
distant
parsifal
tildy
was
a
good
waitress
and
the
men
tolerated
her
they
who
sat
at
her
tables
spoke
to
her
briefly
with
quotations
from
the
bill
of
fare
and
then
raised
their
voices
in
honeyed
and
accents
eloquently
addressed
to
the
fair
aileen
they
writhed
in
their
chairs
to
gaze
around
and
over
the
impending
form
of
tildy
that
aileen
pulchritude
might
season
and
make
ambrosia
of
their
bacon
and
eggs
and
tildy
was
content
to
be
the
unwooed
drudge
if
aileen
could
receive
the
flattery
and
the
homage
the
blunt
nose
was
loyal
to
the
short
grecian
she
was
aileen
friend
and
she
was
glad
to
see
her
rule
hearts
and
wean
the
attention
of
men
from
smoking
and
lemon
meringue
but
deep
below
our
freckles
and
hair
the
unhandsomest
of
us
dream
of
a
prince
or
a
princess
not
vicarious
but
coming
to
us
alone
there
was
a
morning
when
aileen
tripped
in
to
work
with
a
slightly
bruised
eye
and
tildy
solicitude
was
almost
enough
to
heal
any
optic
fresh
guy
explained
aileen
last
night
as
i
was
going
home
at
and
sixth
sashayed
up
so
he
did
and
made
a
break
i
turned
him
down
cold
and
he
made
a
sneak
but
followed
me
down
to
eighteenth
and
tried
his
hot
air
again
gee
but
i
slapped
him
a
good
one
side
of
the
face
then
he
give
me
that
eye
does
it
look
real
awful
til
i
should
hate
that
nicholson
should
see
it
when
he
comes
in
for
his
tea
and
toast
at
ten
tildy
listened
to
the
adventure
with
breathless
admiration
no
man
had
ever
tried
to
follow
her
she
was
safe
abroad
at
any
hour
of
the
what
bliss
it
must
have
been
to
have
had
a
man
follow
one
and
black
one
eye
for
love
among
the
customers
at
bogle
was
a
young
man
named
seeders
who
worked
in
a
laundry
office
seeders
was
thin
and
had
light
hair
and
appeared
to
have
been
recently
and
starched
he
was
too
diffident
to
aspire
to
aileen
notice
so
he
usually
sat
at
one
of
tildy
tables
where
he
devoted
himself
to
silence
and
boiled
weakfish
one
day
when
seeders
came
in
to
dinner
he
had
been
drinking
beer
there
were
only
two
or
three
customers
in
the
restaurant
when
seeders
had
finished
his
weakfish
he
got
up
put
his
arm
around
tildy
waist
kissed
her
loudly
and
impudently
walked
out
upon
the
street
snapped
his
fingers
in
the
direction
of
the
laundry
and
hied
himself
to
play
pennies
in
the
slot
machines
at
the
amusement
arcade
for
a
few
moments
tildy
stood
petrified
then
she
was
aware
of
aileen
shaking
at
her
an
arch
forefinger
and
saying
why
til
you
naughty
girl
ai
you
getting
to
be
awful
miss
slyboots
first
thing
i
know
you
be
stealing
some
of
my
fellows
i
must
keep
an
eye
on
you
my
lady
another
thing
dawned
upon
tildy
recovering
wits
in
a
moment
she
had
advanced
from
a
hopeless
lowly
admirer
to
be
an
of
the
potent
aileen
she
herself
was
now
a
a
mark
for
cupid
a
sabine
who
must
be
coy
when
the
romans
were
at
their
banquet
boards
man
had
found
her
waist
achievable
and
her
lips
desirable
the
sudden
and
amatory
seeders
had
as
it
were
performed
for
her
a
miraculous
piece
of
laundry
work
he
had
taken
the
sackcloth
of
her
uncomeliness
had
washed
dried
starched
and
ironed
it
and
returned
it
to
her
sheer
embroidered
lawn
the
robe
of
venus
herself
the
freckles
on
tildy
cheeks
merged
into
a
rosy
flush
now
both
circe
and
psyche
peeped
from
her
brightened
eyes
not
even
aileen
herself
had
been
publicly
embraced
and
kissed
in
the
restaurant
tildy
could
not
keep
the
delightful
secret
when
trade
was
slack
she
went
and
stood
at
bogle
desk
her
eyes
were
shining
she
tried
not
to
let
her
words
sound
proud
and
boastful
a
gentleman
insulted
me
she
said
he
hugged
me
around
the
waist
and
kissed
me
that
so
said
bogle
cracking
open
his
business
armour
after
this
week
you
get
a
dollar
a
week
more
at
the
next
regular
meal
when
tildy
set
food
before
customers
with
whom
she
had
acquaintance
she
said
to
each
of
them
modestly
as
one
whose
merit
needed
no
bolstering
a
gentleman
insulted
me
in
the
restaurant
he
put
his
arm
around
my
waist
and
kissed
me
the
diners
accepted
the
revelation
in
various
ways
some
incredulously
some
with
congratulations
others
turned
upon
her
the
stream
of
badinage
that
had
hitherto
been
directed
at
aileen
alone
and
tildy
heart
swelled
in
her
bosom
for
she
saw
at
last
the
towers
of
romance
rise
above
the
horizon
of
the
grey
plain
in
which
she
had
for
so
long
travelled
for
two
days
seeders
came
not
again
during
that
time
tildy
established
herself
firmly
as
a
woman
to
be
wooed
she
bought
ribbons
and
arranged
her
hair
like
aileen
and
tightened
her
waist
two
inches
she
had
a
thrilling
but
delightful
fear
that
seeders
would
rush
in
suddenly
and
shoot
her
with
a
pistol
he
must
have
loved
her
desperately
and
impulsive
lovers
are
always
blindly
jealous
even
aileen
had
not
been
shot
at
with
a
pistol
and
then
tildy
rather
hoped
that
he
would
not
shoot
at
her
for
she
was
always
loyal
to
aileen
and
she
did
not
want
to
overshadow
her
friend
at
on
the
afternoon
of
the
third
day
seeders
came
in
there
were
no
customers
at
the
tables
at
the
back
end
of
the
restaurant
tildy
was
refilling
the
mustard
pots
and
aileen
was
quartering
pies
seeders
walked
back
to
where
they
stood
tildy
looked
up
and
saw
him
gasped
and
pressed
the
mustard
spoon
against
her
heart
a
red
was
in
her
hair
she
wore
eighth
avenue
badge
the
blue
bead
necklace
with
the
swinging
silver
symbolic
heart
seeders
was
flushed
and
embarrassed
he
plunged
one
hand
into
his
hip
pocket
and
the
other
into
a
fresh
pumpkin
pie
miss
tildy
said
he
i
want
to
apologise
for
what
i
done
the
other
evenin
tell
you
the
truth
i
was
pretty
well
tanked
up
or
i
would
of
done
it
i
would
do
no
lady
that
when
i
was
sober
so
i
hope
miss
tildy
you
accept
my
and
believe
that
i
would
of
done
it
if
i
known
what
i
was
doin
and
of
been
drunk
with
this
handsome
plea
seeders
backed
away
and
departed
feeling
that
reparation
had
been
made
but
behind
the
convenient
screen
tildy
had
thrown
herself
flat
upon
a
table
among
the
butter
chips
and
the
coffee
cups
and
was
sobbing
her
heart
out
out
and
back
again
to
the
grey
plain
wherein
travel
they
with
blunt
noses
and
hair
from
her
knot
she
had
torn
the
red
and
cast
it
upon
the
floor
seeders
she
despised
utterly
she
had
but
taken
his
kiss
as
that
of
a
pioneer
and
prophetic
prince
who
might
have
set
the
clocks
going
and
the
pages
to
running
in
fairyland
but
the
kiss
had
been
maudlin
and
unmeant
the
court
had
not
stirred
at
the
false
alarm
she
must
forevermore
remain
the
sleeping
beauty
yet
not
all
was
lost
aileen
arm
was
around
her
and
tildy
red
hand
groped
among
the
butter
chips
till
it
found
the
warm
clasp
of
her
friend
do
you
fret
til
said
aileen
who
did
not
understand
entirely
that
little
clothespin
of
a
seeders
ai
worth
it
he
ai
anything
of
a
gentleman
or
he
would
ever
of
apologised
