us
all

deep

fine

the

only
those

are
true

and

which
regard
it
as
the
chief
business
of
all
their

to
persuade
those
under

to

man
has
had
much
inspiration
from
the
country
traversed
and
has
been
intent
upon
all
that
he
has
seen
and
heard
among
the
people
the
other
has
caught
no
inspiration
from
beauty
or
bird
or
blossom
and
only
the
trivialities
of
the
people
have
amused
him
a
traveler
in
athens
or
rome
paris
or
london
may
be
shown
these
cities
by
a
professional
guide
and
yet
gain
only
a
smattering
of
what
these
cities
hold
in
store
for
him
and
remember
little
of
what
he
has
seen
another
traveler
unattended
by
a
guide
but
observant
of
everything
that
comes
to
his
eyes
and
ears
will
carry
away
stores
from
his
visit
to
those
cities
which
shall
be
of
interest
and
be
serviceable
to
all
who
shall
travel
his
way
the
solitary
but
observant
stranger
in
a
country
almost
always
profits
most
from
his
travels
he
is
compelled
to
notice
boulevards
and
buildings
parks
and
people
and
every
day
of
his
travels
is
a
lesson
in
observation
that
accustoms
him
to
remember
all
he
has
once
seen
the
newspaper
correspondents
of
other
days
had
no
or
guides
and
they
were
entire
strangers
in
the
places
they
visited
they
relied
entirely
upon
themselves
to
find
their
way
and
to
discover
everything
that
was
valuable
and
interesting
they
found
much
that
the
modern
guide
either
overlooks
or
disregards
and
wrote
for
the
papers
at
home
what
would
most
interest
and
instruct
their
readers
when
henry
stanley
first
visited
jerusalem
he
insisted
that
the
dragoman
in
charge
of
his
party
should
keep
all
guides
and
out
of
his
sight
in
two
days
stanley
knew
the
streets
and
the
location
of
the
temple
and
the
holy
sepulcher
and
all
the
notable
places
in
that
old
city
if
stanley
is
known
as
one
of
the
most
intelligent
of
travelers
it
is
mainly
because
he
excelled
in
daily
which
every
one
who
thinks
for
himself
recognizes
as
the
supreme
acquisition
of
a
liberal
education
he
often
said
that
he
knew
rome
naples
and
vienna
far
better
than
he
knew
new
york
where
he
had
lived
many
years
of
his
life
in
that
he
resembled
the
rest
of
humanity
who
generally
know
less
about
what
is
notable
in
their
home
places
than
observant
visitors
know
who
stay
there
only
a
short
time
during
their
travels
what
we
pay
for
in
time
and
labor
seems
more
valuable
nothing

a
great
foreign
correspondent
of
his
day
henry
chambers
remained
only
six
hours
at
baalbek
near
damascus
yet
he
wrote
the
clearest
description
that
probably
ever
was
written
of
the
magnificent
temples
at
baalbek
and
he
wrote
these
descriptions
too
at
after
many
and
varied
experiences
while
visiting
other
places
of
greater
importance
many
archeologists
and
literary
men
before
him
had
visited
the
moat
of
the
great
fortress
at
baalbek
still
they
had
never
observed
as
chambers
observed
and
so
they
missed
seeing
the
and
all
the
other
warlike
instruments
used
in
those
ancient
days
which
had
lain
unnoticed
among
those
huge
pillars
and
great
although
general
lew
wallace
lived
a
long
time
at
jerusalem
he
only
imagined
that
there
might
have
been
an
inner
dungeon
underneath
the
great
prison
so
when
he
wrote
he
put
his
leprous
heroine
into
this
imaginary
a
from
northern
england
with
her
afterward
found
the
doorway
of
this
prison
which
wallace
had
only
imagined
to
be
there
on
their
way
from
egypt
and
palestine
to
the
euphrates
travelers
had
for
centuries
passed
over
the
same
path
in
the
desert
but
it
was
reserved
for
a
cutter
of
marble
inscriptions
after
all
these
centuries
to
the
rosetta
stone
by
the

which
archeologists
can
now
read
the
inscriptions
upon
the
tablets
in
the
ancient
palaces
of
babylon
and
ninevah
millions
and
millions
had
seen
the
lid
of
a
teakettle
bobbing
up
and
down
over
the
boiling
water
before
that
scotchman
watt
observed
it
while
making
watches
but
he
was
the
first
of
all
those
millions
whose
close
observation
led
him
to
investigate
this
force
of
boiling
water
in
the
teakettle
then
he
applied
this
power
to
the
which
is
still
the
great
propelling
force
of
the
world
from
the
time
of
the
garden
of
eden
apples
had
fallen
in
the
orchards
of
the
world
through
all
the
of
all
the
billions
that
had
seen
apples
falling
only
sir
isaac
newton
observed
the
law
of
gravitation
that
was
involved
in
their
falling
all
the
great
discoverers
began
with
nearly
the
same
meager
powers
for
observation
that
the
rest
of
the
world
has
but
early
in
life
came
to
value
above
all
other
mental
powers
this
incalculable
power
to
closely
notice
and
each
made
his
realm
of
observation
much
richer
for
his
discoveries
why
do
the
majority
of
us
go
through
life
seeing
nothing
of
the
millions
of
marvelous
truths
and
facts
while
only
a
few
keep
their
eyes
and
ears
wide
open
and
every
day
are
busy
in
piling
up
what
they
have
observed
the
loss
of
our
instincts
seems
to
be
the
price
we
pay
for
the
few
minor
acquisitions
we
get
from
school
and
college
we
put
out
our
brains
to
make
room
for
our
learning
the
man
who
assiduously
cultivates
his
powers
of
observation
and
thus
gains
daily
from
his
experiences
what
helps
him
to
see
farther
and
clearer
everything
in
life
that
is
worth
seeing
has
given
himself
a
discipline
that
is
much
more
important
than
the
discipline
of
all
the
schools
and
the
colleges
without
it
the
greatest
of
the
greatest
universities
are
only
the
records
of
the
observations
of
some
close
observer
whose
better
powers
of
seeing
things
had
been
acquired
mainly
while
he
was
taking
his
courses
in
that
university
under
his
hat
the
intellect
is
both
telescope
and
microscope
if
it
is
rightly
used
it
shall
observe
thousands
of
things
which
are
too
minute
and
too
distant
for
those
who
with
eyes
and
ears
neither
see
nor
hear
the
intellect
can
be
made
to
look
far
beyond
the
range
of
what
men
and
women
ordinarily
see
but
not
all
the
colleges
in
the
world
can
alone
confer
this
power
this
is
the
reward
of
each
must
acquire
it
for
himself
and
perhaps
this
is
why
the
power
of
observing
deeply
and
widely
is
so
much
oftener
found
in
those
men
and
those
women
who
have
never
crossed
the
threshold
of
any
college
but
the
university
of
hard
knocks
the
quickening
power
of
science
only
he
can
know
from
whose
soul
it
gushes
free
when
we
look
back
over
our
life
and
reflect
how
many
things
we
might
have
seen
and
heard
had
we
trained
our
powers
of
observation
we
seem
to
have
climbed
little
and
to
have
spent
most
of
our
time
upon
plateaus
while
our
achievements
seem
little
better
than
scratches
upon
black
marble
mankind
has
a
greater
esteem
for
the
degrees
conferred
by
the
university
of
observation
and
experience
than
for
all
the
other
degrees
of
all
other
universities
in
the
world
the
only
thing
that
seems
most
to
win
the
respect
of
real
men
and
women
for
the
degrees
conferred
by
colleges
is
the
fact
that
the
graduates
have
first
gained
all
that
close
observation
and
wide
experience
can
confer
the
lives
of
the
men
and
the
women
who
have
been
worth
while
keep
reminding
us
how
vastly
more
important
is
this
education
from
ceaseless
observation
than
all
the
mere
learning
from
school
courses
it
takes
ten
pounds
of
the
stuff
gotten
from
observation
and
experience
to
carry
one
pound
of
school
learning
wisely
the
thinking
man
will
never
ask
you
what
college
you
have
gone
through
but
what
college
has
gone
through
you
and
the
ability
and
habit
of
observing
deeply
and
broadly
is
the
preparation
we
all
need
that
the
college
may
go
through
us
confucius

goethe
of
germany
arnold
of
england
lincoln
and
edison
of
america
stand
where
they
stand
in
thought
and
action
solely
because
they
had
in
a
masterly
way
educated
their
power
of
minute
attention
in
building
up
a
huge
business
or
in
amassing
enormous
riches
such
men
as
rothschild
rockefeller
and
carnegie
show
us
especially
how
vitally
important
to
all
material
success
is
steadfast
attendance
at
the
school
of
attention
the
colleges
that
are
advancing
most
rapidly
in
esteem
are
those
which
are
recognizing
more
and
more
the
importance
of
observation
they
require
their
men
to
spend
some
portion
of
their
college
time
in
gaining
experience
in
their
various
lines
through
observing
the
practical
workings
of
their
calling
medical
students
are
in
hospitals
students
of
law
attend
courts
theological
students
engage
in
mission
work
and
engineers
are
found
in
shops
neither
lectures
nor
speculations
can
take
the
place
of
these
experiences
each
is
helpful
to
the
other
when
only
one
may
be
had
the
experience
from
observing
actual
work
is
far
more
important
opportunities
for
observation
of
practical
matters
along
with
theory
is
the
modern
idea
toward
which
all
the
best
modern
institutions
are
tending
in
their
efforts
to
fit
men
for
the
active
business
of
life
nor
has
greatness
from
careful
observation
and
large
experience
distinguished
men
of
action

are
where
they
are
in
the
esteem
of
their
fellow
men
and
in
their
service
to
humanity
because
they
were
the
keenest
among
the
men
acute
in
observation
footnote
the
failure
to
observe
is
strikingly
proved
by
practical
experiment
in
the
psychological
laboratory
reproductions
of
a
familiar
or
unfamiliar
scene
are
placed
in
the
observers
hands
and
they
are
instructed
to
study
the
reproductions
carefully
and
to
remember
what
they
see
after
minutes
careful
study
the
reproductions
are
taken
away
and
a
series
of
questions
concerning
them
are
put
to
the
observers
the
contradictory
answers
to
these
questions
is
strikingly
eloquent
of
the
inability
to
observe
hugo
munsterberg
the
famous
psychologist
made
a
number
of
psychological
experiments
to
determine
the
limits
of
error
in
observation
as
these
limits
affect
the
credibility
of
witnesses
in
the
court
room
some
of
his
findings
are
summarized
in
on
the
witness
stand
your
good
newspaper
reporter
is
a
trained
observer
who
describes
exactly
what
he
sees
yet
the
manner
in
which
even
the
trained
observer
fails
to
observe
correctly
is
unfailingly
demonstrated
by
the
widely
differing
accounts
of
the
same
occurrence
as
reported
in
the
various
newspapers
of
a
community
one
of
the
best
ways
to
learn
to
observe
correctly
and
in
detail
is
to
take
a
hasty
glance
at
the
display
in
a
store
window
pass
on
and
attempt
to
recall
that
which
you
have
seen
the
number
of
objects
what
they
were
and
then
check
your
observing
faculties
by
returning
to
the
window
and
listing
its
contents
continued
practice
of
this
sort
will
greatly
increase
your
observing
powers
perhaps
the
most
famous
known
exponent
of
this
method
for
training
the
observing
faculties
was
houdini
the
famous
magician
who
describes
the
method
in
detail
and
his
experiences
in
applying
it
in
his
memoirs

life
are
incalculable

could
not
be
told
in

book
with
all
that
vivisection
and
dissection
have
revealed
to
scientific
examiners
contagious
and
infectious
diseases
have
been
nearly
removed
from
the
human
family
we
have
been
taught
to
live
better
from
observing
animal
habits
in
searching
for
food
in
building
their
habitats
in
their
mode
of
living
in
their
fear
of
man
and
in
the
methods
they
adopt
to
preserve

all
this

the
investigators
of
animal
life
are
those
who
have
observed
the
origin

and
influence
of
birds
insects
and
creeping
things
but
what
we
have
learned
from
animals
in
the
past
seems
only
a
trifle
in
comparison
with
what
they
will
teach
when
we
go
to
them
with
more
serious
purpose
and
more
carefully
observe
them
the
leaders
in
all
these
investigations
of
animal
life
have
all
been
distinguished
for
their
power
to
discover
in

what
has
escaped
other
people
professor
darwin
close
observation
of
the
doves
he
fed
at
his
door
opened
up
to
him
important
suggestions
and
laid
the
foundation
for
his
great
treatise
the
origin
of
species
when
professor
niles
of
the
boston
school
of
technology
was
a
boy
he
caught
a
minnow
while
returning
from
school
at
his
father
suggestion
he
put
the
fish
into
a
simple
aquarium
and
studied
its
movements
when
it
died
he
carefully
examined
its
parts
under
a
microscope
and
this
experience
was
the
beginning
of
his
vast
knowledge
of
the
animal
realm
while
a
philadelphia
clergyman
was
visiting
a
farmer
in
northern
new
jersey
the
family
became
perturbed
because
their
dog
had
gone
mad
they
fastened
it
in
the
kitchen
and
sought
somebody
to
kill
it
by
shooting
at
it
through
the
window
a
neighbor
observed
the
dog
carefully
and
told
them
it
was
poisoned
he
advised
the
family
to
loose
it
in
order
that
it
might
get
some
antidote
for
itself
in
field
or
forest
he
told
them
that
cats
cattle
and
horses
are
often
compelled
to
find
an
antidote
for
some
poisonous
herb
they
have
eaten
and
that
the
animals
know
more
about
such
things
than
any
teacher
in
the
medical
schools
as
soon
as
the
dog
was
unfastened
he
hastened
across
the
field
to
a
brook
and
ate
a
weed
that
was
growing
beside
the
water
the
dog
soon
returned
to
the
house
and
ate
heartily
after
a
two
weeks
fast
the
clergyman
had
followed
the
dog
and
observed
the
plant
which
it
had
eaten
after
the
dog
had
returned
to
the
house
he
uprooted
the
plant
and
took
some
of
its
leaves
to
a
philadelphia
firm
of
chemists
acting
upon
the
firm
advice
he
sent
the
leaves
to
the
smithsonian
institution
at
washington
and
they
were
found
to
be
a
valuable
antidote
for
poison
not
only
was
humanity
given
a
better
medicine
from
this
discovery
but
the
clergyman
also
derived
a
competency
from
it
this
remedy
for
poisoning
is
often
used
in
prescriptions
so
even
doctors
sometimes
go
to
the
dogs
for
instructions
like
professor
agassiz
and
sir
oliver
lodge
many
find
their
best
instructors
in
domestic
animals
the
fowls
around
the
house
and
the
barn
may
be
whole
universities
for
developing
the
sciences
through
her
dependence
on
nature
the
hen
is
a
more
efficient
instructor
than
the
majority
of
college
professors
she
knows
by
instinct
so
much
of
the
laws
of
nature
that
wise
men
may
sit
at
her
feet
or
her
bill
and
learn
perhaps
she
may
seem
a
little
foolish
in
proclaiming
her
achievements
in
by
a
cackle
but
her
knowledge
of
the
necessities
of
life
her
careful
oversight
of
her
brood
the
way
she
uses
her
feet
and
her
wings
her
foreknowledge
of
approaching
storms
her
means
of
defending
herself
when
attacked
by
hawks
her
knowledge
of
the
formation
of
the
egg
and
of
the
proper
time
to
break
the
shell
for
the
release
of
her
chick
all
these
are
worthy
of
the
attention
of
even
the
greatest
scientists
in
an
address
at
a
convention
oliver
wendell
holmes
said
that
chickens
seem
to
have
in
them
much
more
to
study
than
did
doves
while
holmes
was
once
summering
at
kennebunkport
maine
he
trained
five
chickens
to
come
at
his
call
to
fly
upon
his
head
and
to
leap
with
open
bills
to
catch
a
kernel
of
corn
before
the
season
closed
the
chickens
would
come
to
his
bedroom
even
after
he
had
retired
making
it
necessary
as
doctor
holmes
said
for
the
landlord
to
serve
them
up
for
dinner
doctor
holmes
parody
on
longfellow
a
psalm
of
life
shows
what
a
careful
observer
he
was
while
some
of
admirers
resented
the
parody
as
a
slight
longfellow
himself
always
treated
it
as
complimentary
he
once
told
james
fields
that
in
one
couplet
of
the
parody
holmes
had
excelled
the
entire
original
poem
not
like
muffled
drums
be
beating
on
the
inside
of
the
shell
longfellow
told
fields
that
there
are
always
millions
of
men
standing
like
chickens
in
the
shell
with
wings
they
know
not
how
to
use
having
calls
to
a
larger
life
outside
of
which
they
can
see
nothing
that
some
peck
away
until
dead
on
the
inside
of
the
shell
while
others
assisted
by
a
friend
on
the
outside
step
out
into
a
life
beautiful
and
complete
in
the
egg
or
molecule
we
get
nearer
to
god
than
we
do
through
the
telescope
or
by
encircling
the
earth
he
who
lived
nearest
the
first
cause
gets
the
best
inspiration
for
visions
of
all
greater
sights
or
events
so
the
cottage
is
a
happier
place
than
the
palace
for
him
who
wishes
to
get
better
acquainted
with
what
shall
arouse
finer
thought
and
feeling
the
cottage
is
the
best
preparatory
school
for
the
mansion
provided
always
that
the
cottage
course
has
been
thorough
he
who
has
worn
his
cottage
life
with
manly
dignity
shall
be
the
man
to
wear
his
mansion
life
with
composure
emerson
said
the
entire
system
of
things
gets
represented
in
every
particle
uneasy
is
the
head
that
wears
the
crown
and
unfortunate
is
the
man
who
gets
a
smattering
of
many
things
yet
does
not
know
even
one
small
thing
thoroughly
the
power
of
little
things
to
give
instruction
and
happiness
should
be
the
first
lesson
in
life
and
it
should
be
inculcated
deeply
the
chief
need
of
this
discontented
and
sinful
world
is
to
comprehend
that
in
one
blade
of
grass
or
the
shading
of
an
evening
cloud
there
is
sufficient
reverence
to
fill
the
largest
heart
and
sufficient
science
to
occupy
the
greatest
passion
we
saw
a
delicate
blue
flower
in
the
grass
this
morning
which
i
had
never
noticed
before
it
seemed
a
different
flower
from
each
angle
and
when
put
under
a
had
colors
i
had
never
noticed
before
in
flower
or
art
the
field
where
it
was
growing
had
been
familiar
to
me
for
threescore
years
and
ten
yet
the
flower
was
entirely
new
to
me
it
was
so
dainty
and
attractive
and
inspiring
that
i
felt
i
had
lost
something
important
to
my
spiritual
growth
all
these
years
something
like
the
experience
of
virgil
guizot
carlyle
grotius
or
like
tennyson
in
the
holy
grail
who
declares
that
he
had
left
a
real
and
wonderful
life
behind
to
follow
the
unknown
this
little
flower
in
the
morning
sunlight
awakes
thoughts
of
years
long
past
of
the
faces
of
marshaled
hosts
of
battle
of
eyes
deep
and
calm
with
the
smile
of
a
loving
mother
welcome
of
the
great
forgiveness
in
a
affection
had
i
found
that
flower
seventy
years
before
i
believe
my
appreciation
of
the
divine
power
would
have
been
greater
my
heart
would
have
been
more
satisfied
my
soul
more
fully
illuminated
and
pervaded
by
a
holier
peace
we
lose
ourselves
in
all
attempts
to
grasp
the
cause
of
which
this
small
flower
is
the
result
it
is
impossible
to
find
words
to
convey
the
strange
emotions
which
this
newly
found
flower
aroused
and
to
tell
of
the
distant
realms
my
imagination
visited
while
i
meditated
there
if
we
would
free
ourselves
from
the
perplexing
cares
which
our
daily
duties
demand
if
we
would
forget
the
worries
of
each
day
if
the
losses
and
disappointments
and
the
wrongs
of
many
years
did
not
press
themselves
upon
us
if
the
demands
of
many
duties
and
the
demands
upon
our
attention
and
the
calls
of
friends
did
not
interrupt
we
could
find
in
contemplating
this
wee
flower
of
the
field
a
fund
of
happiness
which
years
of
sorrow
and
misfortune
could
not
destroy
bacon
and
burke
and
niebuhr
discovered
how
much
of
grandeur
can
come
into
a
life
from
the
little
things
about
us
but
they
all
discovered
it
when
it
was
too
late
to
go
back
and
live
the
life
of
simplicity
and
individuality
which
was
suggested
to
them
by
a
drop
of
water
and
a
the
smallest
things
are
the
largest
in
importance
if
they
bring
into
our
lives
the
largest
thoughts
and
feelings
and
an
incentive
to
largest
actions
for
self
and
humanity
why
are
we
forever
looking
upon
the
horizon
for
what
upon
closer
view
lies
at
our
feet
these
little
beauties
of
the
field
rebuke
the
wanderer
and
the
eminent
man
when
it
says
to
all
the
world
with
a
sweet
smile
and
a
dainty
pout
you
could
have
found
more
in
my
life
than
has
ever
been
learned
from
the
sages
while
zinzendorf
was
stranded
nearly
a
year
upon
a
tiny
island
his
vigorous
mind
was
forced
to
occupy
itself
in
observing
the
objects
upon
the
shore
his
examinations
of
the
colors
in
the
led
him
to
say
later
in
life
at
a
meeting
of
philosophers
that
a
lifetime
study
of
these
colors
should
develop
more
of
the
beautiful
than
all
the
manufactured
color
combinations
then
known
art
has
not
yet
been
able
to
combine
the
shades
shown
in
the
shell
of
an
oyster
and
the
wings
of
the
june
bug
have
been
enlarged
and
copied
by
colored
photography
and
will
greatly
influence
all
art
hereafter
needs
shall
be
best
supplied
by
beginning
at
the
source
and
following
the
creator
in
developing
them
into
things
of
beauty
and
service
although
the
agricultural
department
at
washington
spent
eight
million
dollars
in
the
study
of
seeds
and
their
growth
by
sending
experts
to
roam
over
the
world
for
investigations
yet
the
observations
of
luther
burbank
and
many
like
investigators
in
the
agricultural
colleges
throughout
the
country
have
made
many
more
important
discoveries
their
observations
have
brought
about
a
greater
increase
of
production
to
the
acre
than
all
the
results
of
those
who
roamed
the
earth
for
the
government
and
no
one
would
say
that
their
work
was
not
a
fair
investment
for
the
nation
observation
convinces
us
that
the
sooner
we
get
down
to
the
simplicities
of
life
the
longer
and
healthier
and
nobler
shall
life
become
the
healthiest
are
those
with
one
loaf
and
a
natural
hunger
along
with
it
the
noblest
lives
are
those
who
are
anxious
to
become
as
divine
as
it
is
possible
for
them
to
be
are
ever
alert
for
little
deeds
of
kindness
how
much
richer

the
poet
lives
who
can
sympathize
with
the
like

is
lifted
heavenward
by
the
fringed
gentian
like
bryant
who
gets
the
messages
of

from
the

like
shakespeare
we
too
may
find
tongues
in
trees
books
in
running
brooks
sermons
in

and
good
in
everything
if
we
will
but
use
our
eyes
for
seeing
our
ears
for
hearing
our
heads
for
understanding
and
our
hearts
for
feeling
the
poor
man
university

its
courses
everywhere

than

iii
the
bottom
rung
almost
every
day
of
his
life
an
american
is
reminded
that
necessity
is
the
mother
of
invention
it
needs
only
a
little
reflection
and
observation
to
realize
how
much
american
youth
are
blessed
in
the
examples
of
their
countrymen
who
have
come
from
the
humblest
stations
in
life
and
have
risen
through
sheer
pluck
and
perseverance
to
honor
and
helpfulness
we
are
indebted
mainly
to
the
genius
and
the
observation
of
poor
men
for
the
great
inventions
which
have
so
much
contributed
to
the
comfort
the
convenience
the
cheerfulness
and
the
power
of
life
they
have
given
us
steam
as
a
motive
power
the
locomotive
the
telegraph
the
typewriter
the
telephone
the
automobile
the
victrola
the
airship
the
great
advances
that
have
been
made
in
agriculture
through
mowers
reapers
planters
and
special
seeds
and
fruits
are
entirely
the
results
of
their
steadfast
perseverance
nobody
ever
earnestly
reaches
out
for
a
thing
until
he
feels
that
he
needs
it
consequently
the
sons
and
daughters
of
the
rich
are
seldom
the
benefactors
of
humanity
in
the
way
so
many
poor
men
and
women
have
been
through
the
inventions
which
have
lightened
the
drudgery
of
millions
of
homes
as
well
as
increased
marvelously
the
productions
of
the
soil
and
of
the
factory
had
the
talents
of
the
rich
been
put
to
the
test
by
hunger
or
cold
or
the
many
other
incentives
to
vigorous
thought
and
action
which
impel
the
poor
they
also
might
have
many
inventions
to
their
credit
for
the
longing
of
the
normal
soul
furnishes
the
basis
of
all
the
worthy
activities
of
life
the
greatest
drawback
for
rich
men
sons
and
daughters
is
in
having
all
their
wants
supplied
from
the
of
indulgent
parents
they
are
taught
neither
industry
economy
nor
which
often
makes
them
a
social
menace
they
lack
appreciation
for
so
many
of
the
things
in
life
which
help
to
brighten
the
path
of
the
poor
solely
because
they
have
never
needed
them
a
hungry
boy
who
has
stood
on
the
outside
of
a
bakery
clinging
to
a
nickel
and
fighting
a
battle
with
himself
whether
to
invest
it
in
a
bit
of
bread
or
to
take
it
home
to
his
mother
who
has
had
neither
breakfast
nor
dinner
fully
understands
the
value
of
a
dollar
the
superintendent
of
the
patent
office
at
washington
has
confirmed
the
official
report
of
the
french
patent
office
that
there
has
been
no
invention
of
especial
value
which
has
not
been
either
found
or
improved
upon
by
some
poor
man
the
best
was
invented
by
a
sailor
who
had
fallen
overboard
and
had
been
nearly
drowned
an
obscure
native
of
a
duchy
bordered
on
three
sides
by
powerful
nations
invented
the
gun
which
can
fire
six
hundred
shots
while
the
ordinary
gun
is
being
loaded
it
was
a
poor
cambridge
machinist
whose
family
often
suffered
from
lack
of
food
who
invented
the
which
has
changed
the
condition
of
home
life
throughout
the
world
and
relieved
women
of
one
of
their
great
household
burdens
the
chronometer
was
made
practical
for
navigation
by
a
man
who
had
been
lost
at
sea
and
despaired
of
ever
again
reaching
the
shore
the
locomotive
which
has
contributed
more
than
any
other
one
thing
to
the
spread
of
our
people
over
our
vast
country
was
given
to
the
world
by
an
englishman
stephenson
who
in
early
life
had
been
so
poor
that
he
had
little
schooling
more
than
eight
hundred
agricultural
inventions
were
patented
in
and
and
every
one
of
them
is
the
invention
of
some
poor
man
or
woman
as
inventors
women
have
in
recent
years
become
close
competitors
of
men
and
from
kitchen
utensils
to
floor
covering
have
added
much
to
home
comfort
and
home
furnishing
all
the
household
articles
exhibited
lately
in
a
large
shop
in
chicago
were
either
invented
or
improved
by
women
they
have
invented
many
things
for
agriculture
for
manufacturing
and
for
school
furnishings
and
not
a
few
of
the
great
patents
which
have
been
issued
to
men
should
have
been
issued
to
their
wives
women
have
often
awaked
an
idea
which
men
have
wrought
out
for
practical
purposes
the
majority
of
the
benefactors
of
the
world
made
their
discoveries
to
relieve
some
necessity
which
oppressed
them
personally
this
is
especially
true
of
where
the
improvements
of
observant
men
have
so
greatly
increased
the
value
of
domestic
animals
the
value
of
any
study
depends
entirely
upon
what
it
has
done
for
us
and
what
we
are
doing
with
it
lowell
says
that
mere
learning
is
as
insignificant
as
the
collection
of
old
professor
virchow
was
obliged
to
try
various
foods
in
his
experiments
with
his
own
cats
before
he
discovered
what
has
ever
since
been
of
such
benefit
to
all
breeders
of
animals
throughout
the
world
from
the
earliest
days
the
bee
has
offered
a
store
of
the
most
useful
information
but
it
would
never
have
been
known
had
it
not
been
for
such
patient
observers
as
huber
who
although
blind
discovered
more
about
bees
than
the
world
had
ever
known
before
his
day
through
the
patient
service
of
his
wife
and
valet
the
mouse
in
the
field
the
squirrel
in
the
tree
the
eagle
in
her
nest
the
fish
in
the
brook
all
have
taught
us
valuable
lessons
in
conduct
they
have
doubtless
given
hints
which
have
enabled
observant
men
to
give
mankind
many
a
useful
invention
when
we
consider
the
many
thousands
of
useful
inventions
which
have
added
so
much
to
the
convenience
and
the
happiness
of
life
and
when
we
bring
to
mind
how
almost
all
of
these
have
come
from
the
humblest
of
the
sons
of
men
with
none
of
the
advantages
of
the
higher
education
of
which
we
hear
so
much
we
are
forced
to
agree
with
sir
walter
scott
that
the
best
part
of
every
man
education
is
that
which
he
gives
himself
independent
of
other
than
the
book
of
life
every
real
man
and
woman
attends
a
school
or
college
not
to
learn
but
to
learn
how
to
learn
this
is
the
best
work
that
schools
of
any
description
can
do
it
lays
a
firm
foundation
upon
which
the
man
who
has
learned
how
to
learn
can
build
his
own
superstructure
the
men
who
have
achieved
success
in
the
march
of
the
ages
are
those
who
have
been
the
architects
of
their
own
life
nobody
cares
a
fig
where
we
get
our
educational
tools
the
world
is
interested
only
in
what
we
are
doing
with
them
must
be
or
whether
we
go
to
college
or
work
in
the
fields
one
teacher
can
be
serviceable
to
a
thousand
of
the
sort
who
intend
to
make
themselves
but
a
thousand
teachers
can
not
help
one
of
the
other
sort
heredity
and
environment
and
will
are
the
great
deciding
factors
in
every
life
investigations
as
to
the
food
values
of
meats
grains
fruits
vegetables
and
other
foods
are
now
being
made
by
the
government
by
colleges
and
other
investigators
this
is
the
movement
of
importance
for
the
uplift
of
humanity
but
the
most
of
this
kind
of
investigating
has
been
done
in
household
kitchens
it
is
probable
that
many
of
the
greatest
discoveries
as
to
food
will
hereafter
be
made
in
the
same
places
by
those
who
are
inclined
to
observe
the
need
of
closer
scientific
knowledge
of
the
chemistry
of
digestion
and
the
chemistry
of
food
is
vital
it
should
call
forth
the
most
investigation
it
is
said
by
those
who
have
carefully
studied
the
subject
that
per
cent
of
all
disease
is
attributable
directly
or
indirectly
to
the
stomach
our
ailments
come
mainly
from
our
aliments
nourishing
food
is
an
essential
of
a
noble
life
the
stomach
is
the
master
of
the
house
and
must
be
respected
a
proper
diet
and
a
sound
head
are
closely
allied
and
those
who
will
rightly
exercise
their
must
be
watchful
of
the
stomach
those
who
would
rule
and
lead
must
have
chest
and
stomach
as
well
as
head
and
will
nobody
else
has
such
opportunities
for
observing
the
effects
of
food
and
for
studying
the
happy
results
of
nutritious
food
as
those
have
who
prepare
the
meals
in
the
kitchen
proper
nourishment
is
something
which
touches
humanity
on
every
side
and
deserves
the
closest
attention
of
the
greatest
minds
we
can
better
afford
to
dispense
with
scientific
experts
in
every
other
line
which
now
engages
them
than
to
dispense
with
those
who
investigate
the
food
question
the
idea
among
the
myriads
of
american
housekeepers
that
it
is
ignoble
drudgery
to
spend
some
of
their
time
in
their
kitchens
ministering
to
the
health
of
those
who
are
nearest
and
dearest
to
them
and
removing
diseases
from
them
through
and
food
is
being
gradually
overcome
by
many
schools
and
colleges
the
sciences
connected
with
food
are
now
placed
among
the
most
important
subjects
in
the
curricula
of
these
schools
it
takes
a
master
mind
to
handle
the
chemical
combinations
of
the
kitchen
which
make
hale
and
happy
men
and
women
boys
and
girls
health
is
symmetry
disease
is
deformity
both
are
mainly
the
result
of
what
we
eat
food
has
killed
more
than
the
sword
in
every
age
and
is
perhaps
killing
more
than
ever
before
achievement
in
and
is
involved
in
the
question
of
proper
food
if
women
forsake
the
throne
that
rightly
belongs
to
the
cook
men
must
assume
it
or
christian
civilization
shall
cease
nobody
can
become
so
supreme
a
benefactor
of
humanity
as
the
man
or
the
woman
who
devotes
intellect
and
all
other
power
to
the
study
of
scientific
eating
when
we
come
rightly
to
understand
all
the
vital
questions
that
are
involved
in
nutrition
we
shall
feel
that
the
kings
among
men
and
the
queens
among
women
are
to
be
sought
in
no
higher
place
than
in
kitchens
we
are
forever
searching
among
the
stars
to
discover
kings
when
they
are
far
oftener
found
in
cottages
in
the
valley
if
universities
fail
to
make
the
knowledge
of
the
right
nutrition
practical
and
fail
to
bring
it
down
where
humble
men
and
women
may
get
it
and
apply
it
the
fault
is
their
own
some
day
a
people
grateful
for
the
health
they
enjoy
may
elect
a
man
to
the
presidency
of
our
nation
or
set
him
upon
some
throne
because
he
is
the
best
scientific
cook
in
the
land
doctor
agnew
of
philadelphia
said
that
he
had
gained
his
most
important
knowledge
of
hospital
work
as
an
adviser
of
the
dietitians
while
feeding
his
dog
and
his
cat
in
speaking
of
the
discovery
of
radium
by
madame
curie
professor
virchow
said
that
he
had
often
felt
that
our
investigators
had
not
taken
sufficient
notice
of
the
force
of
animal
electricity
the
few
experiments
already
made
in
applying
to
machinery
electricity
generated
by
the
human
body
has
opened
up
a
field
for
observant
scientists
in
many
ways
both
birds
and
beasts
contribute
to
the
welfare
of
humanity
and
the
observing
thinker
will
still
find
many
more
ways
in
which
he
can
aid
us
all
forms
of
life
can
be
harnessed
to
the
car
of
civilization
and
far
more
effective
work
shall
be
done
than
is
being
done
as
teachers
and
as
subjects
of
practical
investigation
animals
supply
a
great
university
which
almost
every
man
and
woman
can
attend

home
reading
carlyle
says
that
a
collection
of
books
is
a
true
university
in
these
days
it
might
be
added
that
often
the
smaller
the
collection
the
larger
shall
be
the
university
education
derived
from
libraries
is
unsafe
for
as
well
as
drunkenness
ends
in
debauchery
toward
the
end
of
his
long
and
life
doctor
holmes
advised
a
young
correspondent
to
confine
his
reading
to
the
bible
shakespeare
and
a
good
dictionary
the
list
of
men
who
have
been
lifted
to
higher
regions
of
thought
and
feeling
and
action
from
reading
any
one
of
these
three
would
be
too
long
to
be
compressed
within
the
covers
of
one
book
books
are
like
swords
dangerous
unless
one
knows
how
to
use
them
they
either
lead
up
or
drag
down
and
we
sink
or
rise
to
the
level
of
the
books
we
read
every
one
reads
but
how
many
read
to
advantage
goethe
the
greatest
of
all
the
very
greatest
germans
said
i
have
been
learning
how
to
read
for
the
past
fifty
years
but
have
not
yet
succeeded
the
majority
of
readers
resemble
their
reading
runs
in
and
out
and
leaves
no
traces
and
some
others
are
like
they
pass
all
that
is
good
and
retain
only
the
refuse
at
best
only
a
small
percentage
of
our
life
is
spent
in
school
the
greater
part
of
the
remainder
each
must
pass
in
the
university
of
daily
life
where
our
education
is
derived
from
experience
gained
through
in
daily
contact
with
our
fellows
and
from
the
fellowship
of
books
fellowship
fits
the
relation
perfectly
for
there
must
be
intimate
intercourse
such
as
this
word
implies
or
it
is
with
books
as
with
life
a
man
profits
little
from
being
merely
with
ten
thousand
and
he
may
be
incalculably
injured
from
his
intercourse
with
them
but
a
few
friends
often
the
the
better
bring
a
steady
growth
of
higher
spiritual
power
greater
than
can
be
had
from
all
other
influences
combined
so
it
is
with
books
acquaintance
with
a
thousand
often
renders
a
capable
man
impotent
but
a
few
friends
with
whom
he
frequently
and
earnestly
communes
lift
him
in
strength
of
intellect
and
will
and
tenderness
and
sweetness
of
feeling
to
be
the
peer
of
the
worthiest
the
beginning
of
new
england
was
the
golden
age
of
scholarship
in
america
for
many
of
the
founders
of
these
colonies
had
been
reared
in
english
universities
such
was
the
struggle
in
these
bleak
and
barren
colonies
for
existence
during
the
first
years
that
in
a
few
generations
the
majority
of
their
posterity
were
strangers
to
almost
all
the
books
of
and
with
which
their
forefathers
were
acquainted
and
were
forced
to
glean
all
they
harvested
from
the
bible
and
the
almanac
especially
the
almanac
the
almanac
was
eagerly
perused
by
every
member
of
the
family
from
the
dawn
of
the
year
to
its
setting
the
reputed
thrift
of
the
plain
people
in
this
corner
of
the
great
world
is
largely
attributable
to
the
lessons
of
the
almanac
mainly
richard
which
the
bostonian
franklin
annually
edited
in
philadelphia
for
over
a
quarter
of
a
century
his
chief
purpose
was
to
drive
home
forcibly
many
lessons
which
might
encourage
the
colonists
to
get
the
most
out
of
their
hard
and
isolated
lives
peabody
the
successful
man
of
business
and
munificent
philanthropist
said
that
an
almanac
and
a
were
the
foundation
of
the
education
through
which
he
ultimately
did
so
much
good
for
multitudes
of
his
countrymen
it
should
be
interesting
and
instructive
to
know
how
many
more
during
the
epoch
in
new
england
and
the
generations
since
that
time
have
been
indebted
to
one
book
for
the
pluck
and
perseverance
by
which
they
have
carved
out
a
place
of
honor
for
themselves
never
were
books
so
eagerly
so
often
and
so
carefully
read
as
these
poor
almanacs
never
perhaps
has
any
other
book
except
the
bible
been
so
potent
an
influence
in
shaping
the
life
of
a
nation
and
shaping
it
to
a
place
among
the
whose
beneficent
influences
have
humanized
the
world
many
a
writer
has
reminded
us
that
the
almanac
was
the
studied
by
our
ancestry
in
beginning
the
enormous
agricultural
commercial
mercantile
manufacturing
and
financial
interests
which
in
four
generations
have
placed
us
in
front
of
the
richest
nations
of
the
earth
think
of
the
many
millions
of
dollars
invested
in
and
the
many
millions
more
invested
in
the
books
they
shelter
think
of
the
five
hundred
millions
spent
annually
in
public
education
and
the
hundreds
of
millions
that
have
been
put
into
college
buildings
and
college
breeding
still
from
all
this
stupendous
investment
there
will
never
come
men
and
women
who
will
make
any
more
out
of
their
learning
than
thousands
of
men
and
women
of
colonial
days
who
knew
the
contents
of
no
books
other
than
the
bible
and
the
almanac
the
quality
of
the
literary
attainment
of
those
reared
in
a
library
may
be
higher
and
perhaps
not
but
wider
and
deeper
are
the
supreme
objects
of
all
and
educational
struggle
where
a
man
gets
the
educational
tools
with
which
to
accomplish
all
this
is
not
at
all
important
if
an
almanac
can
help
one
man
to
get
the
same
as
another
man
gets
from
the
polishing
of
the
greatest
universities
in
the
world
the
almanac
is
the
peer
of
the
university
whether
materials
as
insignificant
as
the
almanac
have
been
used
to
attain
just
such
results
the
history
of
our
country
and
of
several
other
countries
can
readily
prove
three
books
made
up
the
library
of
lincoln
the
of
edison
and
carnegie
the
telegraph
operators
but
no
three
men
of
the
nation
were
ever
more
successful
in
reaching
the
goals
they
set
for
themselves
books
are
the
great
universal
means
of
and
knowing
them
depends
upon
reading
them
rightly
it
is
not
so
important
how
books
we
read
but
how
we
read
them
a
fool
is
one
of
the
most
pestilential
of
blockheads
one
book
avails
more
than
a
thousand
little
reading
and
much
thinking
make
a
wise
man
much
reading
and
little
thinking
has
bred
the
race
which
the
people
call
learned
fools
and
these
are
mainly
responsible
for
any
ridicule
that
is
put
upon
the
work
of
school
and
college
in
these
days
when
the
has
largely
superseded
the
pulpit
and
the
platform
it
is
vitally
important
that
men
shall
be
taught
how
to
read
rightly
and
shall
be
helped
to
habits
of
right
reading
and
no
school
or
college
that
is
decently
interested
in
the
welfare
of
the
people
can
disregard
this
one
duty
of
teachers
all
much
of
the
best
in
thought
and
feeling
and
conduct
shall
depend
hereafter
upon
the
books
which
we
read
with
careful
observation
every
man
who
has
read
himself
into
higher
realms
is
under
bonds
to
make
the
source
of
so
much
bliss
and
blessedness
as
admirable
and
as
desirable
as
possible
to
all
who
are
strangers
to
the
most
pleasant
and
profitable
paths
of
literature
it
is
not
the
quantity
of
our
reading
but
the
quality
that
makes
it
and
us
an
influence
for
good
to
our
fellows
a
man
who
has
read
ten
pages
with
real
accuracy
says
john
ruskin
is
forevermore
in
some
measure
an
educated
person
you
might
read
all
the
books
in
the
british
museum
yet
be
an
utterly
illiterate
and
uneducated
person
our
reading
without
digestion
and
assimilation
is
as
useless
as
our
food
without
them
bacon
says
that
reading
makes
a
man
but
fullness
without
digestion
is
dyspepsia
the
books
whose
reading
impels
us
to
live
nobly
and
do
noble
service
for
others
are
books
and
it
is
a
wicked
waste
of
time
to
read
what
is
a
negative
quantity
whoever
masters
book
can
never
become
commonplace
is
the
in
reading
as
in
every
other
undertaking
those
who
have
accumulated
wisdom
culture
power
riches
are
always
prominent
for
their
indefatigable
painstaking
thoroughness
nothing
to
them
is
a
trifle
for
trifles
make
perfection
and
perfection
is
no
trifle
those
who
have
thought
most
and
felt
most
and
done
most
from
their
reading
have
brought
this
master
passion
to
it
when
we
begin
to
become
acquainted
with
all
the
worthy
men
and
women
who
trace
the
beginning
of
their
worth
to
the
careful
reading
of
one
book
it
seems
almost
a
loss
to
the
world
to
have
the
libraries
of
the
world
so
large
if
they
were
all
respectable
occupants
of
their
shelves
it
might
be
condoned
but
the
copyright
of
millions
of
books
is
the
only
right
human
or
divine
for
their
existing
at
all
many
a
country
boy
at
the
fireside
during
the
long
winter
evenings
has
received
inspiration
from
repeatedly
reading
one
or
two
worthy
books
these
have
spurred
him
on
to
fight
his
way
valiantly
through
college
and
from
there
to
the
heights
in
some
worthy
if
we
are
true
to
all
that
involves
there
is
no
in
the
conviction
that
each
one
of
us
is
born
for
kingship
supreme
kingship
consists
in
a
stronger
state
and
a
truer
state
than
that
of
other
men
which
enables
us
to
and
the
misguided
and
the
illiterate
every
thoughtful
man
and
woman
ultimately
discovers
that
all
and
all
are
useful
only
so
far
as
they
confirm
this
calm
and
beneficent
kingly
power
emerson
is
the
supreme
among
human
beings
the
best
that
can
be
known
and
experienced
lies
asleep
in
books
and
one
of
the
chief
purposes
for
getting
an
education
is
to
give
us
the
head
and
the
feeling
to
awake
this
best
knowledge
and
experience
in
these
sleeping
princes
de
quincey
reminds
us
that
all
the
greatest
books
may
be
divided
into
the
literature
of
and
the
literature
of
they
have
all
been
written
in
utmost
sincerity
by
the
and
the
they
disclose
boundless
fields
for
and
in
the
march
of
civilization
the
men
and
the
nations
that
have
forged
farthest
ahead
since
gutenberg
invented
printing
are
the
men
and
the
nations
that
have
had
most
to
do
with
the
few
books
of
and
of
the
greatest
and
the
wisest
there
can
be
no
better
test
of
a
man
thought
and
feelings
and
actions
than
the
books
he
reads
and
the
books
he
keeps
around
him
and
there
is
none
so
desolate
as
the
poor
man
who
lives
in
a
great
bookless
house
and
has
never
fed
upon
the
dainties
that
are
bred
in
books
as
john
milton
says
the
very
presence
of
books
is
refining
and
the
right
kind
of
man
would
as
soon
think
of
building
his
house
without
windows
as
of
furnishing
it
without
books
in
every
home
of
intelligent
men
and
women
the
library
is
always
one
of
the
annual
items
of
expenditure
when
we
have
learned
how
to
consult
the
books
of
and
they
let
us
mingle
with
the
best
society
of
all
ages
they
make
the
men
and
women
of
words
and
deeds
our
advisers
they
bring
us
the
gold
of
learning
and
the
gems
of
thought
and
they
furnish
us
with
the
which
brings
the
proper
kind
of
such
books
are
the
safest
of
companions
for
they
protect
us
from
vice
and
the
inferior
passions
more
than
ever
they
are
for
all
who
are
striving
to
do
the
higher
work
of
civilization
and
every
book
we
read
gives
us
greater
faith
in
the
and
the
of
life
as
lowell
says
adds
another
block
to
the
climbing
spire
of
a
great
soul
the
other
sort
which
swarm
from
the
cozy
marshes
of
immoral
brains
the
sort
also
who
rack
their
brains
for
lucre
do
the
devil
work
for
him
and
are
as
baneful
as
the
company
of
fools
and
vulgarians
show
an
observant
man
your
bookshelves
and
he
tell
you
what
you
are
the
man
who
does
not
some
great
book
is
not
worth
the
time
we
spend
in
his
company
we
are
fortunate
if
we
are
not
in
some
way
contaminated
by
him
if
we
knew
the
road
they
have
traveled
we
should
likely
find
that
those
of
modern
times
who
have
merited
the
crown
of
kings
and
queens
for
their
stronger
state
and
their
state
have
had
most
to
do
with
some
literature
of
knowledge
and
power
that
they
especially
oftenest
consulted
the
books
of
the
greatest
and
wisest
in
their
difficulties
and
had
been
spurred
on
by
their
messages
to
the
thoughts
and
the
deeds
which
made
them
worthy
it
is
fortunate
that
the
greatest
of
books
are
the
common
property
of
the
printers
of
the
world
for
they
are
on
this
account
the
cheapest
and
many
of
them
can
be
had
for
the
price
of
a
poor
dinner
it
needs
many
a
page
to
record
even
the
names
of
the
men
and
women
who
have
become
and
have
done
just
from
reading
some
one
worthy
book
which
had
fallen
into
their
hands
many
believe
that
franklin
is
the
greatest
american
that
has
yet
appeared
and
he
has
said
that
cotton
mather
to
do
gave
me
a
turn
of
thinking
which
perhaps
had
an
influence
on
some
of
the
principal
future
events
of
my
life
as
we
become
better
acquainted
with
some
of
the
books
in
all
departments
of
literature
we
are
surprised
to
find
how
few
of
them
have
been
written
by
college
men
this
by
no
means
belittles
the
good
that
may
come
from
a
college
course
but
it
does
seem
to
emphasize
that
great
books
need
some
other
environment
for
their
growth
than
exclusive
college
courses
perhaps
the
need
is
communion
with
nature
and
frequent
intercourse
with
the
world
greatest
and
best
in
thought
and
feeling
and
action
for
the
work
men
are
in
a
marked
minority
among
the
authors
whose
great
books
have
been
and
are
a
potent
force
in
shaping
thought
and
conduct
in
the
world
it
is
notable
how
few
of
these
have
anything
commendatory
to
say
about
the
influence
which
their
college
life
had
upon
them
and
their
accomplishments
many
even
of
the
of
schools
and
colleges
have
come
from
men
whose
powers
were
shaped
by
no
school
how
many
of
medicine
and
law
were
prepared
by
physicians
and
lawyers
whose
knowledge
was
gleaned
mainly
from
keen
observation
and
long
experience
and
deep
thought
it
was
no
mere
college
education
but
the
sharpest
home
observation
and
strictest
adherence
to
their
instincts
and
their
individuality
that
made
forceful

americans
with
over
twenty
millions
of
dollars
to
their
credit
only
had
even
a
course
many
among
them
however
had
mentality
and
secured
a
comprehensive
practical
education
they
have
evidently
been
as
alert
to
perceive
the
treasures
hidden
for
them
in
the
world
of
great
books
as
they
have
been
to
perceive
the
treasuries
hidden
for
them
in
their
various
enterprises
so
we
find
that
they
have
consulted
the
master
spirits
of
books
after
their
daily
tasks
were
done
while
myriads
of
those
who
scoff
and
sneer
at
them
now
because
of
their
millions
were
feasting
frolicking
and
dissipating
among
the
highest
types
of
american
manhood
a
large
majority
are
the
men
whatever
else
may
be
said
about
them
all
the
world
acknowledges
that
it
is
the
parvenus
in
every
land
who
do
the
largest
part
of
the
greatest
work
the
larger
our
horizon
becomes
the
stronger
is
our
conviction
that
the
man
himself
is
the
architect
of
his
own
fate
others
may
give
an
occasional
lift
but
it
is
almost
entirely
his
own
work
the
college
can
do
something
for
the
and
it
should
also
give
something
for
the
and
the
power
to
dare
and
to
do
but
all
the
external
training
in
the
world
can
never
attain
for
the
man
what
he
can
attain
through
his
own
individual
efforts
provided
he
has
lofty
aims
firm
resolutions
closely
observes
and
strictly
adheres
to
all
his

the

v
thoughtfulness
president
wolsey
head
of
a
great
university
said
that
one
of
the
chief
purposes
of
the
college
is
to
cultivate
the
to
the
college
man
who
neglects
to
cultivate
this
valuable
power
until
he
enters
upon
his
college
career
instead
of
beginning
it
in
the
kindergarten
and
continuing
it
unremittingly
throughout
his
entire
preparatory
course
and
daily
living
will
be
liable
to
make
sorry
work
of
this
part
of
his
cultivation
or
any
other
part
while
he
is
in
college
the
specialists
who
teach
in
colleges
and
who
are
generally
more
interested
in
their
specialties
than
in
the
science
and
art
of
education
may
not
be
conscious
of
this
and
yet
the
many
educational
wrecks
that
have
come
from
colleges
should
long
ago
have
brought
this
point
most
forcibly
to
their
attention
indeed
the
power
to
think
and
the
practice
of
thinking
until
it
has
become
second
nature
are
so
essential
for
success
in
any
career
in
life
that
it
is
truer
to
say
that
one
of
the
chief
purposes
of
itself
is
to
cultivate
and
exercise
the
power
to
think
and
keep
right
on
thinking
until
close
thinking
shall
become
a
habit
the
power
to
think
clearly
broadly
and
successfully
is
not
necessarily
the
prerogative
of
those
only
who
have
lived
in
a
college
environment
as
the
biographies
of
our
own
four
thousand
in
this
country
so
cogently
prove
for
few
of
them
ever
darkened
the
doors
of
a
college
some
among
them
may
have
been
bereft
of
all
the
nobler
sentiments
for
which
christianity
and
america
stand
but
they
never
could
have
piled
up
their
millions
in
every
department
of
activity
without
having
thought
so
long
and
so
hard
that
they
ultimately
acquired
a
habit
of
thinking
that
should
put
to
shame
myriads
in
every
land
who
have
had
all
the
advantages
of
universities
the
power
to
think
and
to
think
in
a
masterly
way
need
not
be
confined
to
the
professor
chair
any
sphere
of
action
which
does
not
bring
in
to
the
worker
an
increase
of
thinking
power
is
harmful
from
university
to
a
machine
is
the
only
worker
that
can
do
its
work
well
without
thinking
about
it
all
the
successful
men
the
world
has
ever
known
have
been
men
who
thought
incessantly
they
have
been
mainly
in
their
extraordinary
power
to
think
their
success
in
all
the
various
tasks
which
they
set
for
themselves
oftener
resulted
from
their
hard
thought
than
from
their
hard
work
defeat
and
failure
have
never
overtaken
the
man
whose
head
and
hands
were
partners
when
we
think
without
work
or
work
without
thought
we
reach
only
half
of
what
belong
to
us
a
man
should
especially
ween
himself
from
this
kind
of
halfness
we
should
be
ashamed
to
find
ourselves
working
without
thought
as
we
should
be
ashamed
to
find
ourselves
idle
in
a
world
where
there
is
always
so
much
to
be
done
and
so
little
time
allotted
to
each
for
accomplishing
worthy
work
the
employees
that
are
most
valuable
to
their
employers
and
are
most
valued
by
them
are
those
always
whose
heads
and
hands
are
when
hands
and
head
and
heart
are
on
the
job
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
what
heights
of
success
and
service
shall
be
attained
the
farmer
boy
hoeing
corn
and
digging
potatoes
will
do
better
work
in
quantity
and
quality
if
he
thinks
about
his
work
as
hard
as
he
hoes
or
digs
there
can
be
little
danger
of
failure
for
any
young
man
who
begins
his
with
the
resolution
that
he
will
always
give
his
best
thought
to
even
the
most
insignificant
task
that
he
assumes
and
all
the
schools
in
the
world
can
not
furnish
him
any
advantage
that
can
compare
with
this
resolution
steadily
followed
nor
must
the
habit
of
thinking
be
exercised
only
upon
work
we
all
have
more
leisure
than
work
and
many
a
thinker
has
reminded
us
that
a
man
is
best
to
be
judged
not
by
his
profession
but
by
his
leisure
elihu
burritt
acquired
a
knowledge
of
fifty
languages
during
the
years
he
earned
his
livelihood
as
a
village
blacksmith
he
also
found
time
for
extensive
reading
as
well
as
time
for
interest
in
social
reforms
in
the
advancement
of
which
he
won
the
reputation
of
being
one
of
the
most
powerful
and
persuasive
orators
of
his
day
all
his
stupendous
acquirements
were
gained
during
the
hours
between
his
tasks
which
thousands
of
other
village
blacksmiths
were
accustomed
to
spend
in
gossip
or
in
the
tavern
volumes
could
be
filled
with
only
accounts
of
the
men
and
women
throughout
the
ages
who
have
made
the
world
better
for
their
living
just
because
they
wisely
and
thoughtfully
employed
the
leisure
hours
which
their
contemporaries
trifled
away
the
shortest
life
may
be
long
in
noble
thought
and
action
if
we
lose
no
time
and
little
of
it
is
ever
lost
by
those
who
thoughtfully
employ
their
leisure
thoughtful
men
and
women
are
always
doubly
valuable
no
matter
whether
their
work
is
what
the
world
calls
or
the
streets
are
better
swept
by
such
a
man
and
the
potatoes
are
better
hoed
the
floor
is
better
scrubbed
by
such
a
woman
and
the
clothes
are
better
washed
if
our
work
does
not
afford
us
the
chance
to
think
while
we
are
employed
upon
it
we
owe
it
to
ourselves
and
to
humanity
to
toss
it
aside
quickly
the
lawyer
the
physician
or
any
other
professional
man
is
no
more
a
man
in
the
sight
of
god
and
his
country
than
the
who
lays
the
foundations
for
their
houses
and
raises
the
superstructures
and
they
are
under
no
greater
obligation
to
use
their
thinking
powers
than
he
is
the
place
we
occupy
in
life
is
unimportant
the
way
we
fill
the
place
is
everything

food
for

if

fuller
lives
every

than

it
is
because
they
think

to

about

iron
that
was
softened
in

furnace
before
him
and
asked
questions
of
the
older
employees
and
the

he
read
upon
the
subject
and
became
so
capable
in

and

manufacturing

when

plant
was
sold
to

corporation
he
was
the

to
the
increase
of
his

his
life
is
given
to
numberless
good
deeds
chief
among
which
has
been
his
endeavor
to
impress
upon
all
workmen
the
necessity
of
letting
both
their
heads
and
hearts
assist
their

neither

tools

if
after
all
the
centuries
of
civilization
we
are
doing
work
with
them
something
must
be
wrong
with
the
educational
methods
when
god
sent
us
here
he
packed
us
with
all
we
need
for
manhood
our
and
our

well
done
up
but
often
in
the
unpacking
by
the

we
have
been
sadly
marred
and
these

seem
to
have
been
frequently
thrown
upon
the
they
seem
to
have
dulled
our
instincts
and
to
have
despised
our

in

to
make

endowments
if

god
seems
to
have
had
in
mind
when

sent
us
here
what
justification
have
the
teachers
of
civilization
for
failing
to
perfect

what

john
ruskin
complains
in
that
modern
education
for
the
most
part
signifies
giving
people
the
faculty
of
thinking
wrong
on
every
conceivable
subject
of
importance
to
them
if
this
is
even
partly
true
there
is
no
pursuit
that
demands
from
the
man
who
is
working
in
it
more
of
and
more
than
the
business
of
getting
education
those
who
are
conducting
what
we
are
foolish
enough
to
permit
them
to
call
are
often
both
blind
and
deaf
to
all
that
efficient
education
implies
to
seek
direction
from
them
is
like
asking
the
road
from
a
blind
man
many
are
also
connected
with
the
schools
apparently
as
others
are
connected
with
and
to
procure
a
livelihood
often
their
highest
conception
of
the
work
is
to
make
sharp
blades
of
the
intellects
for
what
they
call
getting
along
in
the
world
then
many
of
the
instructors
in
schools
and
colleges
are
merely
specialists
mainly
interested
in
their
specialties
and
using
the
as
a
to
their
own
purposes
extreme
specializing
is
narrowing
it
does
to
the
specialist
what
blinkers
do
to
the
horse
eyes
excessive
pursuit
of
single
objects
of
thought
atrophies
many
faculties
but
is
the
development
and
discipline
of
all
the
faculties
perhaps
these
are
some
of
the
causes
why
so
many
and
men
and
women
are
so
hostile
to
schools
and
accuse
them
of
mainly
being
places
that
polish
pebbles
and
dim
diamonds
and
say
so
many
other
harsh
and
cutting
things
about
them
learning
seems
to
be
the
occupation
of
those
who
profess
to
educate
learning
for
its
sake
plays
a
very
part
in
the
spiritual
equipment
of
god
children
to
a
education
it
seems
at
best
only
what
the
carpenter
kit
is
to
the
carpenter
a
means
to
an
end
like
all
other
lumber
its
importance
depends
entirely
upon
what
is
built
out
of
it
these
original
and
thinking
men
and
women
have
often
said
hard
things
of
mere
learning
and
of
those
who
dole
it
out
at
so
much
a
because
they
believe
that
undue
stress
is
laid
upon
it
they
sometimes
say
that
universities
are
not
institutions
but
merely
and
often
they
are
very
seats
difficult
for
people
to
stiffen
their
backs
enough
to
sit
upon
but
it
the
not
the
studies
that
educates
studies
make
men
but
not
often
men
such
as
education
always
makes
not
all
learned
heads
are
the
learned
man
may
be
a
very
learned
fool
the
learned
frequently
put
out
their
reasoning
powers
to
make
room
for
their
learning
it
requires
ten
pounds
of
to
take
care
of
one
pound
of
learning
solomon
made
a
book
of
proverbs
but
a
book
of
proverbs
never
made
solomon
sense
without
learning
is
a
thousand
times
superior
to
learning
without
sense
and
in
the
stately
edifice
of
life
school
and
college
are
only
the
basement
walls
wisdom
and
learning
are
not
necessary
companions
the
great
things
that
have
conduced
to
the
betterment
of
the
world
have
been
done
by
men
who
have
been
loyal
to
their
individuality
and
true
to
their
instincts
never
by
the
merely
learned
too
often
do
we
find
these
little
learned
men
displaying
themselves
offensively
and
ridiculously
in
the
haunts
of
bearded
men
and
making
the
angels
weep
by
their
strutting
and
their
swelling
is
only
a
part
of
life
is
nearly
of
life
and
the
done
is
done
through
the
education
which
is
the
product
of
what
is
as
well
as
of
what
is
the
education
which
enables
men
and
women
to
perceive
and
to
cherish
the
in
art
in
literature
in
morals
and
in
nature
while
true
education
busies
itself
with
acquirements
it
is
even
more
concerned
that
the
instincts
and
the
individuality
god
appears
to
regard
of
supreme
importance
shall
attain
all
that
it
is
possible
for
them
to
have
these
original
and
thinking
men
and
women
who
say
so
many
things
in
condemnation
of
education
and
mere
learning
boldly
and
lovingly
acclaim
the
helps
from
true
education
they
remind
us
that
it
is
spiritual
perfection
torch
and
sword
and
shield
the
and
the
of
life
the
fountain
of
all
noble
living
and
the
only
real
promoter
of
civilization
they
claim
that
education
of
this
sort
simplifies
life
facilitates
intensifies
individuality
unfolds
and
uplifts
manhood
breeds
habits
of
thinking
feeling
and
doing
debestializes
emancipates
humbles
and
civilizes
that
it
searches
for
truth
loves
the
beautiful
desires
the
good
and
does
the
best
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
education
that
accomplishes
all
these
for
it
fosters
the
instincts
and
the
individuality
for
which
we
are
pleading
we
have
always
believed
that
just
this
kind
of
education
is
the
heritage
of
every
american
and
that
the
loss
of
such
an
education
is
the
greatest
calamity
that
can
befall
any
one
all
our
life
have
we
yearned
that
all
might
have
this
boon
and
the
best
of
our
manhood
years
have
been
ceaseless
labor
and
struggle
to
give
the
weak
and
friendless
sons
of
men
all
of
its
advantages
the
test
of
any
system
of
education
is
the
kind
of
man
it
turns
out
it
is
wisdom
to
measure
the
system
by
those
it
fails
to
educate
rather
than
by
those
it
does
educate
by
its
tortoises
rather
than
by
its
hares
the
real
educator
is
always
vastly
more
concerned
with
the
divinity
than
with
the
depravity
of
those
intrusted
to
him
he
believes
firmly
that
the
instincts
and
the
individuality
which
god
has
given
each
of
us
are
the
priceless
part
of
all
our
spiritual
equipment
that
anything
we
may
acquire
toward
this
end
which
fortifies
these
treasures
is
cheap
even
if
bought
by
an
entire
that
any
acquirement
that
modifies
these
or
destroys
them
is
a
triple
curse
and
a
dire
menace
to
humanity
for
individuality
is
the
genius
of
christianity
and
of
america
the
system
of
education
which
makes
light
of
the
cultivation
of
the
instincts
which
seems
to
be
the
sole
dependence
of
all
conditions
of
men
except
the
the
system
of
education
which
is
blinded
to
all
that
is
implied
in
an
educated
individuality
these
are
the
only
systems
with
which
we
have
any
quarrel
rather
than
heads
are
what
is
needed
and
should
be
demanded
without
which
it
is
impossible
for
any
one
of
us
to
have
the
right
conception
of
life
or
to
attain
all
that
we
were
intended
to
be
or
to
do
to
guard
and
develop
the
instincts
of
the
child
to
preserve
and
fortify
his
individuality
is
to
give
him
sword
and
shield
for
the
battle
of
life
god
intends
each
individual
to
be
an
individual
or
this
should
not
have
been
so
in
all
to
be
just
like
every
one
else
is
to
be
predestined
for
inferiority
and
failure
to
do
our
duty
consistently
and
steadfastly
demands
that
all
our
and
qualities
shall
first
of
all
be
educated
that
best
becomes
a
man
which
his
individuality
intended
him
to
be
and
those
are
always
successful
in
making
a
life
and
a
living
who
play
the
game
of
life
with
the
cards
their
individuality
gives
them
god
made
a
world
for
each
separate
man
and
within
that
world
he
live
if
he
will
live
effectually
we
must
first
of
all
be
ourselves
must
see
to
it
that
whatever
else
is
neglected
the
plants
god
has
put
into
the
individual
shall
be
cultivated
the
crop
may
not
be
large
but
we
are
accountable
for
the
cultivation
not
for
the
crop
we
must
be
ourselves
and
do
our
own
work
there
can
be
no
greater
wisdom
and
no
greater
service
than
that
of
helping
another
so
that
he
may
duly
live
in
that
special
world
which
god
has
created
for
him
the
most
insignificant
man
can
be
complete
if
he
is
entirely
true
to
his
instincts
and
to
his
individual
character
if
we
are
incomplete
it
is
because
we
are
living
after
some
other
method
we
have
all
been
stamped
with
individuality
but
many
seem
to
do
their
utmost
to
soak
off
the
stamp
how
different
should
the
life
of
all
the
world
be
if
each
one
only
kept
in
his
frame
and
would
not
permit
any
one
to
try
to
make
him
part
of
the
picture
for
which
his
personality
never
intended
him
