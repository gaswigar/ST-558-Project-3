i
the
virtuous
hypocrites
at
first
sight
they
had
as
little
reason
for
being
unhappy
as
it
is
possible
to
have
in
a
world
half
full
of
sorrow
they
were
young
and
healthy
half
a
dozen
times
they
had
each
declared
the
other
more
than
common
they
both
had
and
never
knew
what
it
was
not
to
have
money
enough
for
comfort
and
in
addition
that
divine
little
superfluity
wherefrom
joys
are
born
the
house
was
good
to
look
at
and
good
to
live
in
there
were
horses
to
ride
the
river
to
go
on
and
a
big
box
from
mudie
every
week
no
one
worried
them
miss
bussey
was
generally
visiting
the
poor
or
as
was
the
case
at
this
moment
asleep
in
her
with
paul
the
terrier
in
his
basket
beside
her
and
the
cat
on
her
lap
lastly
they
were
plighted
lovers
and
john
was
staying
with
miss
bussey
for
the
express
purpose
of
delighting
and
being
delighted
by
his
fianc√©e
mary
travers
for
these
and
all
their
mercies
certainly
they
should
have
been
truly
thankful
however
the
heart
of
man
is
wicked
this
fact
alone
can
explain
why
mary
sat
sadly
in
the
feeling
a
letter
that
was
tucked
inside
her
waistband
and
john
strode
moodily
up
and
down
the
gravel
walk
a
cigar
badly
bitten
between
his
teeth
and
his
hand
over
and
again
covertly
stealing
toward
his
and
pressing
a
scented
note
that
lay
there
in
the
course
of
every
turn
john
would
pass
the
window
of
the
then
mary
would
look
up
with
a
smile
and
blow
him
a
kiss
and
he
nodded
and
laughed
and
returned
the
salute
but
the
window
passed
both
sighed
deeply
and
returned
to
lingering
those
hidden
missives
poor
little
girl
i
must
keep
it
up
said
john
dear
good
john
he
must
never
know
thought
mary
and
the
two
fell
to
thinking
just
what
was
remarked
a
few
lines
back
namely
that
the
human
heart
is
very
wicked
they
were
shocked
at
themselves
the
young
often
are
miss
bussey
awoke
sat
up
evicted
the
cat
and
found
her
spectacles
where
are
those
children
said
she
billing
and
cooing
somewhere
i
suppose
bless
me
why
do
they
get
tired
of
it
they
had
not
indeed
of
billing
and
cooing
in
general
for
no
one
at
their
age
does
or
ought
to
get
tired
of
that
but
of
billing
and
cooing
with
one
another
it
will
be
observed
that
the
situation
promised
well
for
a
tragedy
nevertheless
this
is
not
the
story
of
an
unhappy
marriage
if
there
be
one
thing
which
government
should
forbid
it
is
a
secret
engagement
engagements
should
be
advertised
as
marriages
are
but
unless
we
happen
to
be
persons
of
social
importance
or
considerable
notoriety
no
such
precautions
are
taken
of
course
there
are
engagement
rings
but
a
man
never
knows
one
when
he
sees
it
on
a
hand
it
would
indeed
be
impertinent
to
look
too
closely
and
when
he
goes
out
alone
he
generally
puts
his
in
his
pocket
considering
that
the
evening
will
thus
be
rendered
more
enjoyable
the
ashforth
travers
engagement
was
not
a
secret
now
but
it
had
been
and
had
been
too
long
hence
when
mary
went
to
scotland
and
met
charlie
ellerton
and
when
john
went
to
switzerland
and
met
dora
truth
is
they
ought
never
to
have
separated
and
miss
bussey
who
was
one
of
the
people
in
the
secret
had
been
quite
right
when
she
remarked
that
it
seemed
a
curious
arrangement
john
and
mary
had
scoffed
at
the
idea
of
a
few
weeks
absence
having
any
effect
on
their
feelings
except
if
indeed
it
were
possible
that
of
intensifying
them
i
really
think
i
ought
to
go
and
find
them
said
miss
bussey
come
paul
she
took
a
parasol
for
the
april
sun
was
bright
and
went
into
the
garden
when
she
came
to
the
window
john
was
away
at
the
end
of
the
walk
she
looked
at
him
he
was
reading
a
letter
she
looked
in
at
the
window
mary
was
reading
a
letter
well
exclaimed
miss
bussey
have
they
had
a
tiff
and
she
slowly
waddled
truth
imposes
this
was
very
stout
toward
the
unconscious
john
he
advanced
toward
her
still
reading
not
only
did
he
not
see
her
but
he
failed
to
notice
that
paul
had
got
under
his
feet
he
fell
over
paul
and
as
he
stumbled
the
letter
fluttered
out
of
his
hand
paul
seized
it
and
began
to
toss
it
about
in
great
glee
good
doggie
cried
miss
bussey
come
then
bring
it
to
me
dear
good
paul
john
face
was
distorted
with
agony
he
darted
toward
paul
fell
on
him
and
gripped
him
closely
paul
yelped
and
miss
bussey
observed
in
an
indignant
tone
that
john
need
not
throttle
the
dog
john
muttered
something
is
the
letter
so
very
precious
asked
his
hostess
ironically
precious
cried
john
yes
no
it
nothing
at
all
but
he
opened
paul
mouth
and
took
out
his
treasure
with
wonderful
care
and
why
inquired
miss
bussey
are
you
not
with
mary
young
man
you
very
neglectful
neglectful
surely
miss
bussey
you
have
noticed
anything
like
neglect
do
say
bless
the
boy
i
was
only
joking
you
a
model
lover
thank
you
thank
you
i
go
to
her
at
once
and
he
sped
towards
the
window
opened
it
and
walked
up
to
mary
miss
bussey
followed
him
and
arrived
just
in
time
to
see
the
lovers
locked
in
one
another
arms
their
faces
expressing
all
appropriate
rapture
there
nothing
much
wrong
said
miss
bussey
wherein
miss
bussey
herself
was
much
wrong
what
a
shame
i
left
you
alone
for
more
than
an
hour
said
john
have
you
been
very
unhappy
and
he
added
darling
it
sounded
like
an
afterthought
i
have
been
rather
unhappy
answered
mary
and
her
answer
was
true
as
she
said
it
she
tucked
in
a
projecting
edge
of
her
letter
john
had
hurriedly
slipped
his
it
was
rather
the
worse
for
its
mauling
into
his
you
you
did
think
me
neglectful
oh
no
i
was
thinking
of
you
all
the
time
and
i
was
thinking
of
you
dear
are
you
very
happy
yes
john
are
you
of
course
i
am
happy
i
should
think
so
and
he
kissed
her
with
unimpeachable
fervor
when
a
conscientious
person
makes
up
his
mind
that
he
ought
for
good
reasons
to
deceive
somebody
there
is
no
one
like
him
for
hypocrisy
when
two
conscientious
people
resolve
to
deceive
one
another
on
grounds
of
duty
the
acme
of
duplicity
is
in
a
fair
way
to
be
reached
john
ashforth
and
mary
travers
illustrated
this
proposition
the
former
had
been
all
his
life
a
good
son
and
was
now
a
trustworthy
partner
to
his
father
who
justly
relied
no
less
on
his
character
than
on
his
brains
the
latter
since
her
parents
early
death
had
left
her
to
her
aunt
care
had
been
the
comfort
and
prop
of
miss
bussey
life
it
is
difficult
to
describe
good
people
without
making
them
seem
dull
but
luckily
nature
is
defter
than
novelists
and
it
is
quite
possible
to
be
good
without
being
dull
neither
mary
nor
john
was
dull
a
trifle
limited
perhaps
they
were
a
thought
severe
in
their
judgments
of
others
as
well
as
of
themselves
a
little
exacting
with
their
friends
and
more
than
a
little
with
themselves
one
description
paints
them
both
doubtless
their
harmony
of
mind
had
contributed
more
than
mary
sweet
expression
and
finely
cut
features
or
john
upstanding
six
feet
and
honest
capable
face
to
produce
that
attachment
between
them
which
had
six
months
before
this
story
begins
culminated
in
their
engagement
once
arrived
at
this
ending
seemed
to
have
been
inevitable
everybody
discovered
that
they
had
foretold
it
from
the
first
and
modestly
disclaimed
any
credit
for
anticipating
a
union
between
a
couple
so
obviously
made
for
one
another
the
distress
into
which
lovers
such
as
these
fell
when
they
discovered
by
personal
experience
that
sincerely
to
vow
eternal
love
is
one
thing
and
sincerely
to
give
it
quite
another
may
be
well
imagined
and
may
well
be
left
to
be
imagined
they
both
went
through
a
terrible
period
of
temptation
wherein
they
listened
longingly
to
the
seductive
pleading
of
their
hearts
but
both
emerged
triumphant
resolved
to
stifle
their
mad
fancy
to
prefer
good
faith
to
mere
inclination
and
to
avoid
at
all
costs
wounding
one
to
whom
they
had
sworn
to
be
true
thus
far
their
steadfastness
carried
them
but
not
beyond
they
could
part
from
their
loved
ones
and
they
did
but
they
could
not
leave
them
without
a
word
each
wrote
after
leaving
scotland
and
switzerland
respectively
a
few
lines
of
adieu
confessing
the
love
they
felt
but
with
resolute
sadness
saying
farewell
forever
they
belonged
to
another
it
was
the
answers
that
mary
and
john
were
reading
when
miss
bussey
discovered
them
mary
ran
my
dear
miss
travers
i
have
received
your
letter
i
ca
tell
you
what
it
means
to
me
you
say
all
must
be
over
between
us
do
be
offended
but
i
wo
say
that
yet
it
ca
be
your
duty
to
marry
a
man
you
do
love
you
forbid
me
to
write
or
come
to
you
and
you
ask
only
for
a
word
of
i
wo
say
i
say
revoir
au
my
darling
charlie
burn
this
this
was
john
my
dear
ashforth
what
am
i
to
say
to
you
oh
why
why
did
you
tell
me
before
i
ought
to
say
that
but
it
is
too
late
to
conceal
anything
from
you
yes
you
are
right
it
must
be
yes
i
will
try
to
forget
you
but
oh
john
it
very
very
very
difficult
i
do
know
how
to
sign
this
so
i
wo
you
know
who
it
comes
from
wo
you
burn
this
these
letters
no
doubt
make
it
plain
that
there
had
been
at
least
a
momentary
weakness
both
in
mary
and
in
john
but
in
a
true
and
charitable
view
their
conduct
in
rising
superior
to
temptation
finally
was
all
the
more
remarkable
and
praiseworthy
they
had
indeed
for
the
time
been
carried
away
even
now
mary
found
it
hard
not
to
make
allowances
for
herself
little
as
she
was
prone
to
weakness
when
she
thought
of
the
impetuous
and
conquering
whirl
with
which
charlie
ellerton
had
wooed
her
and
john
confessed
that
flight
alone
a
hasty
flight
from
interlaken
after
a
certain
evening
spent
in
gazing
at
the
jungfrau
had
saved
him
from
casting
everything
to
the
winds
and
yielding
to
the
slavery
of
dora
bellairs
sunny
smiles
and
charming
coquetries
he
had
always
thought
that
that
sort
of
girl
had
no
attractions
for
him
just
as
mary
had
despised
like
charlie
ellerton
well
they
were
wrong
the
only
comfort
was
that
shallow
natures
felt
these
sorrows
less
it
would
have
broken
heart
thought
john
or
john
thought
mary
but
dora
and
charlie
would
soon
find
consolation
in
another
but
here
oddly
enough
john
generally
swore
heartily
and
mary
always
began
to
search
for
her
handkerchief
they
as
affectionate
as
one
could
wish
when
together
mused
miss
bussey
as
she
stroked
the
cat
but
at
other
times
they
gloomy
company
i
suppose
they
ca
be
happy
apart
dear
dear
and
the
good
old
lady
fell
to
wondering
whether
she
had
ever
been
so
foolish
herself
chapter
ii
sympathy
in
sorrow
give
me
observed
sir
roger
deane
cannes
a
fine
day
a
good
set
to
look
at
a
beehive
chair

good
cigar
a
cocktail

one
side
and
a
nice
girl
on
the
other
and
there
i
am

do
want
anything

general
bellairs
pulled
his
white
mustache
and
examined
sir

and
surroundings

a
smile

only
lady
deane

your
complete
happiness

he

i
do

i
do
interposed
a
young
man
who
wore
an
eye
glass
and
was
in
charge
of
a
large
jug
she
gone
to
monte
i
might

said
sir
roger

the
general

to
put
it
in
a
book

writes
books

know
she
put
me
in
the
last
made
me
a
dashed
fool
too
by
jove
that
was
unkind
said
the
general
from
your
wife
oh
lord
love
you
she
did
mean
it
i
was
the
hero
that
how
i
came
to
be
such
an
ass
the
dear
girl
meant
everything
that
was
kind
who

her
to
monte
charlie
ellerton

the
young
man
with
the
there
i
told
you

a
kind
girl

trying
to
pull
old
charlie
up
a
peg
or
two
he
had
the
deuce
of
a
facer
you
know
i
thought
he
seemed
less
cheerful
than

oh
rather
he
met
a
girl
somewhere
or
other
i
always
forget
places
miss
miss
hang
it
i
ca
remember
names
and
got
awfully
smitten
and
everything
went
pleasantly
and
she
took
to
him
like
anything
and
at
last
old
charlie
spoke
up
like
a
man
and
sir
roger
paused
dramatically
well
asked
the
general
she
was
engaged
to
another
fellow
rough
was
it
she
told
old
charlie
she
liked
him
infernally
but
promises
were
promises
do
you
know
and
she
thank
him
to
take
his
hook
and
he
had
to
take
it
by
gad
rough
do
you
know
so
maud
been
cheering
him
up
the
devil
what
the
matter
now
inquired
the
general
why
i
just
remembered
that
i
promised
to
say
nothing
about
it
i
say
do
you
repeat
it
general
nor
you
either
laing
the
general
laughed
well
said
sir
roger
he
ought
to
have
been
such
a
fool
as
to
tell
me
he
knows
i
never
remember
to
keep
things
dark
it
not
my
fault
a
girl
came
out
of
the
hotel
and
strolled
up
to
where
the
group
was
she
was
dark
slight
and
rather
below
middle
height
her
complexion
at
this
moment
was
a
trifle
sallow
and
her
eyes
listless
but
it
seemed
rather
as
though
she
had
dressed
her
face
into
a
tragic
cast
the
set
of
the
features
being
naturally
mirthful
she
acknowledged
the
salutations
and
sat
down
with
a
sigh
not
on
asked
sir
roger
waving
his
cigar
toward
the
courts
no
said
miss
bellairs
are
you
seedy
dolly
inquired
the
general
no
said
miss
bellairs
laing
fixed
his
and
surveyed
the
young
lady
are
you
taking
any
said
he
indicating
the
jug
i
do
see
any
fun
in
vulgarity
observed
miss
bellairs
the
general
smiled
sir
roger
lips
assumed
the
shape
for
a
whistle
that
a
nasty
one
for
me
said
laing
ah
here

are
roger
exclaimed
a
fresh
clear
voice
from
behind
the
chairs

looking
for
you
everywhere
we
seen
everything
ellerton
was
most
kind
and
i
do
so
want
to

my
impressions
the
was
lady
deane
a
tall
young
woman
plainly
dressed
in
a
serviceable
cloth
by
her
side
stood
charlie
ellerton
in
a
flannel
suit
of
pronounced
striping
he
wore
a
little
yellow
mustache
had
blue
eyes
and
curly
hair
and
his
face
was
tanned
a
wholesome
he
looked
very
melancholy
letters
from
hell
murmured
sir
roger
but
i
was
so
distressed
continued
his
wife
ellerton
would
gamble
and
he
lost
ever
so
much
money
a
fellow
must
amuse
himself
remarked
charlie
gloomily
and
with
apparent
unconsciousness
he
took
a
glass
from
laing
and
drained
it
gambling
and
drink
what
does
that
mean
asked
sir
roger
shut
up
deane
said
charlie
miss
bellairs
rose
suddenly
and
walked
away
her
movement
expressed
impatience
with
her
surroundings
after
a
moment
charlie
ellerton
slowly
sauntered
after
her
she
sat
down
on
a
some
way
off
charlie
placed
himself
at
the
opposite
end
a
long
pause
ensued
i
afraid
i
precious
poor
company
said
charlie
i
did
want
you
to
be
company
at
all
answered
miss
bellairs
and
she
sloped
her
parasol
until
it
obstructed
his
view
of
her
face
i
awfully
sorry
but
i
ca
stand
the
sort
of
rot
deane
and
laing
are
talking
ca
you
neither
can
i
they
never
seem
to
be
serious
about
anything
you
know
and
charlie
sighed
deeply
and
for
three
minutes
there
was
silence
do
you
know
scotland
at
all
asked
charlie
at
last
only
a
little
there
last
year
no
i
was
in
switzerland
oh
do
you
know
interlaken
no
oh
may
i
have
a
cigarette
of
course
if
you
like
charlie
lit
his
cigarette
and
smoked
silently
for
a
minute
or
two
i
call
this
a
beastly
place
said
he
yes
horrid
she
answered
and
the
force
of
sympathy
made
her
move
the
parasol
and
turn
her
face
towards
her
companion
but
i
thought
she
continued
you
came
here
every
spring
oh
i
do
mind
the
place
so
much
it
the
people
yes
is
it
i
know
what
you
mean
you
ca
make
a
joke
of
everything
can
you
indeed
no
sighed
dora
charlie
looked
at
his
cigarette
and
his
eyes
carefully
fixed
on
it
said
in
a
timid
tone
what
the
point
for
instance
of
talking
as
if
love
was
all
bosh
dora
parasol
swept
down
again
swiftly
but
charlie
was
still
looking
at
the
cigarette
and
he
did
not
notice
its
descent
nor
could
he
see
that
miss
bellairs
cheek
was
no
longer
sallow
it
such
cheap
rot
he
continued
and
when
a
fellow
i
say
miss
bellairs
i
not
boring
you
the
parasol
wavered
and
finally
moved
no
said
miss
bellairs
i
do
know
whether
you
no
i
must
say
that
but
i
know
what
it
is
to
be
in
love
miss
bellairs
but
what
the
good
of
talking
about
it
everybody
laughs
miss
bellairs
put
down
her
parasol
i
should
laugh
she
said
softly
it
horrid
to
laugh
at
people
when
they
in
trouble
and
her
eyes
were
very
sympathetic
you
are
kind
i
do
mind
talking
about
it
to
you
you
know
i
not
the
sort
of
fellow
who
falls
in
love
with
every
girl
he
meets
so
of
course
it
worse
when
i
do
was
it
just
lately
murmured
dora
last
summer
ah
and
and
did
she
oh
i
do
know
yes
hang
it
i
believe
she
did
she
was
perfectly
straight
miss
bellairs
i
do
say
a
word
against
her
think
she
did
know
her
own
feelings
until
until
i
spoke
you
know
and
then
do
go
on
if
if
it
does
why
then
the
poor
girl
cried
and
said
it
could
be
because
she
she
was
engaged
to
another
fellow
and
she
sent
me
away
miss
bellairs
was
listening
attentively
and
continued
charlie
she
wrote
and
said
it
must
be
and
and
and
you
think
she
she
told
me
so
whispered
charlie
she
said
she
could
part
without
telling
me
oh
i
say
miss
bellairs
is
it
all
damnable
i
beg
your
pardon
dora
was
tracing
little
figures
on
the
gravel
with
her
parasol
now
what
would
you
do
cried
charlie
she
loves
me
i
know
she
does
and
she
going
to
marry
this
other
fellow
because
she
promised
him
first
i
do
suppose
she
knew
what
love
was
then
oh
i
sure
she
did
exclaimed
dora
earnestly
you
ca
blame
her
you
know
and
it
absurd
to
to
to
not
to
well
to
marry
a
fellow
you
do
care
for
when
you
care
for
another
fellow
you
know
yes
of
course
you
can
hardly
imagine
yourself
in
that
position
but
suppose
a
man
liked
you
was
placed
like
that
you
know
what
should
you
feel
you
ought
to
do
oh
i
do
know
exclaimed
dora
clasping
her
hands
oh
do
tell
me
what
you
think
i
give
the
world
to
know
charlie
surprised
glance
warned
her
of
her
betrayal
you
must
ask
me
she
exclaimed
hastily
i
wo
ask
a
word
i
i
awfully
sorry
miss
bellairs
nobody
knows
she
murmured
nobody
shall
through
me
you
not
very
i
very
ashamed
why
and
because
of
me
after
what
i
told
you
charlie
rose
suddenly
i
not
going
to
stand
it
he
announced
dora
looked
up
eagerly
what
you
going
to
i
going
to
have
a
shot
at
it
am
i
to
stand
by
and
see
her
hanged
if
i
do
could
that
be
right
i
should
like
to
know
what
one
is
this
talk
with
you
has
made
me
quite
clear
we
reasoned
it
out
you
see
they
not
to
be
married
for
two
or
three
months
a
lot
can
be
done
in
that
time
ah
you
a
man
i
shall
write
first
if
that
does
do
i
shall
go
to
her
dora
shook
her
head
mournfully
now
look
here
miss
bellairs
you
do
mind
me
advising
you
i
ought
not
to
have
let
you
see
but
as
it
is
you
do
as
i
do
you
stick
to
it
confound
it
you
know
when
life
happiness
is
at
stake
oh
yes
yes
one
must
be
squeamish
must
one
and
dora
bellairs
in
a
very
low
whisper
answered
no
i
shall
write
oh
yes
now
promise
me
you
will
too
it
harder
for
me
than
you
not
if
he
really
oh
indeed
he
really
does
mr
ellerton
then
you
write
perhaps
no
promise
well
it
must
be
right
yes
i
will
i
feel
the
better
for
our
talk
miss
bellairs
do
you
i
do
a
little
we
shall
be
friends
now
you
know
even
if
i
bring
it
off
i
sha
be
content
unless
you
do
too
wo
you
give
me
your
good
wishes
indeed
i
will
shake
hands
on
it
they
shook
hands
and
began
to
stroll
back
to
the
they
look
a
little
better
observed
sir
roger
deane
who
had
been
listening
to
an
eloquent
description
of
the
dora
and
charlie
walked
on
towards
the
hotel
hi
shouted
sir
roger
tea
coming
out
here
i
got
a
letter
to
write
said
charlie
well
miss
bellairs
you
must
come
who
to
pour
it
out
i
must
catch
the
post
sir
roger
answered
dora
they
went
into
the
house
together
in
the
hall
they
parted
you
let
me
know
what
happens
ellerton
wo
you
i
so
interested
and
you
oh
well
perhaps
and
the
sallow
of
her
cheeks
had
turned
to
a
fine
dusky
red
as
she
ran
upstairs
thus
it
happened
that
a
second
letter
for
john
ashforth
and
a
second
letter
for
mary
travers
left
cannes
that
night
and
if
it
seems
a
curious
coincidence
that
dora
and
charlie
should
meet
at
cannes
it
can
only
be
answered
that
they
were
each
of
them
just
as
likely
to
be
at
cannes
as
anywhere
else
besides
who
knows
that
these
things
are
all
coincidence
chapter
iii
a
providential
disclosure
on
wednesday
the
eleventh
of
april
john
ashforth
rose
from
his
bed
full
of
a
great
and
momentous
resolution
there
is
nothing
very
strange
in
that
perhaps
it
is
just
the
time
of
day
when
such
things
come
to
a
man
and
in
ordinary
cases
they
are
very
prone
to
disappear
with
the
relics
of
breakfast
but
john
was
of
sterner
stuff
he
had
passed
a
restless
night
tossed
to
and
fro
by
very
disturbing
gusts
of
emotion
and
he
arose
with
the
firm
conviction
that
if
he
would
escape
shipwreck
he
must
secure
his
bark
by
immovable
anchors
while
he
was
though
not
in
honor
yet
in
law
and
fact
free
he
could
not
trust
himself
sorrowfully
admitting
his
weakness
he
turned
to
the
true
the
right
the
heroic
remedy
i
marry
mary
to
day
fortnight
said
he
when
we
are
man
and
wife
i
shall
forget
this
madness
and
love
her
as
i
used
to
he
went
down
to
breakfast
ate
a
bit
of
toast
and
drank
a
cup
of
very
strong
tea
presently
mary
appeared
and
greeted
him
with
remarkable
tenderness
his
heart
smote
him
and
his
remorse
strengthened
his
determination
i
want
to
speak
to
you
after
breakfast
he
told
her
his
manner
was
so
significant
that
a
sudden
gleam
of
hope
flashed
into
her
mind
could
it
be
that
he
had
seen
that
he
would
be
generous
she
banished
the
shameful
hope
she
would
not
accept
generosity
at
the
expense
of
pain
to
him
miss
bussey
professing
to
find
bed
the
best
place
in
the
world
was
in
the
habit
of
taking
her
breakfast
there
the
lovers
were
alone
and
the
meal
ended
they
passed
together
into
the
conservatory
mary
sat
down
and
john
leant
against
the
glass
door
opposite
her
well
said
she
smiling
at
him
it
suddenly
struck
john
that
in
a
scene
of
this
nature
it
him
to
stand
three
yards
from
the
lady
he
took
a
chair
and
drew
it
close
beside
her
the
thing
had
to
be
done
and
it
should
be
done
properly
we
made
a
mistake
mary
he
announced
taking
her
hand
and
speaking
in
a
rallying
tone
a
mistake
she
cried
oh
how
in
fixing
our
marriage
so
soon
my
darling
said
john
and
it
was
impossible
to
deny
admiration
to
the
tone
he
said
it
in
no
so
late
what
are
we
waiting
for
why
are
we
wasting
all
this
precious
time
mary
could
not
speak
but
consternation
passed
for
an
appropriate
confusion
and
john
pursued
his
passionate
pleadings
as
mary
felt
his
grasp
and
looked
into
his
honest
eyes
her
duty
lay
plain
before
her
she
would
not
stoop
to
paltry
excuses
on
the
score
of
clothes
invitations
or
such
trifles
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
the
thing
surely
she
ought
to
do
it
in
the
way
most
gracious
and
most
pleasing
to
her
lover
if
aunt
consents
she
murmured
at
last
do
as
you
like
john
dear
and
the
embrace
which
each
felt
to
be
inevitable
at
such
a
crisis
passed
between
them
a
discreet
cough
separated
them
the
butler
stood
in
the
doorway
with
two
letters
on
a
salver
one
he
handed
to
mary
the
other
to
john
and
walked
away
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
however
even
our
butlers
do
not
know
everything
that
happens
in
our
houses
to
say
nothing
of
our
hearts
although
much
they
may
think
they
do
john
looked
at
his
letter
started
violently
and
crushed
it
into
his
pocket
he
glanced
at
mary
her
letter
lay
neglected
on
her
lap
she
was
looking
steadily
out
of
the
window
well
that
settled
said
john
i
i
think
i
have
a
cigar
dear
yes
do
darling
said
mary
and
john
went
out
these
second
letters
were
unfortunately
so
long
as
to
make
it
impossible
to
reproduce
them
they
were
also
very
affecting
from
its
pathos
charlie
from
its
passion
but
the
waves
of
emotion
beat
fruitlessly
on
the
walls
of
conscience
at
almost
the
same
moment
mary
brushing
away
a
tear
and
john
blowing
his
nose
sat
down
to
write
a
brief
a
final
answer
we
are
to
be
married
today
fortnight
they
said
they
closed
the
envelopes
without
a
moment
delay
and
went
to
drop
their
letters
in
the
box
the
servant
was
already
waiting
to
go
to
the
post
with
them
and
a
second
later
the
fateful
documents
were
on
their
way
to
cannes
now
said
john
with
a
ghastly
smile
we
can
have
a
glorious
long
day
together
mary
was
determined
to
leave
herself
no
loophole
we
must
tell
aunt
what
what
we
have
decided
upon
this
morning
she
reminded
him
it
means
that
the
wedding
must
be
very
quiet
i
sha
mind
that
shall
you
i
shall
like
it
of
all
things
she
answered
come
and
find
aunt
sarah
miss
bussey
had
always
or
at
least
for
a
great
many
years
back
maintained
the
general
proposition
that
young
people
do
not
know
their
own
minds
this
morning
news
confirmed
her
opinion
why
the
other
day
you
both
agreed
that
the
middle
of
june
would
do
perfectly
now
you
want
it
all
done
in
a
scramble
the
pair
stood
before
her
looking
very
guilty
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
this
she
very
nearly
said
extraordinary
haste
miss
bussey
asked
only
one
indulgence
from
her
friends
before
she
did
a
kind
thing
she
liked
to
be
allowed
to
say
one
or
two
sharp
ones
her
niece
was
aware
of
this
fancy
of
hers
and
took
refuge
in
silence
john
less
experienced
in
his
hostess
ways
launched
into
the
protests
appropriate
to
an
impatient
lover
well
said
miss
bussey
i
must
say
you
look
properly
ashamed
of
yourself
john
certainly
did
so
i
see
what
can
be
done
what
a
fluster
we
shall
live
in
upon
my
word
you
might
as
well
have
made
it
tomorrow
the
fuss
would
have
been
no
worse
and
a
good
deal
shorter
the
next
few
days
passed
as
miss
bussey
had
predicted
in
a
fluster
mary
was
running
after
dress
makers
john
after
licenses
tickets
a
best
man
and
all
the
impedimenta
of
a
marriage
the
intercourse
of
the
lovers
was
much
interrupted
and
to
this
miss
bussey
attributed
the
low
spirits
that
mary
sometimes
displayed
there
there
my
dear
she
would
say
impatiently
for
the
cheerful
old
lady
hated
long
faces
you
have
enough
of
him
and
to
spare
by
and
by
curiously
this
point
of
view
did
not
comfort
mary
she
liked
john
very
much
she
esteemed
him
even
more
than
she
liked
him
he
would
she
thought
have
made
an
ideal
brother
ah
why
had
she
not
made
a
brother
of
him
while
there
was
time
then
she
would
have
enjoyed
his
constant
friendship
all
her
life
for
it
was
not
with
him
as
with
that
foolish
boy
charlie
all
or
nothing
john
was
reasonable
he
would
not
have
threatened
well
reading
his
letter
one
way
charlie
almost
seemed
to
be
tampering
with
propriety
john
would
never
have
done
that
and
these
reflections
all
of
which
should
have
pleaded
for
john
ended
in
weeping
over
the
lost
charms
of
charlie
one
evening
just
a
week
before
the
wedding
she
roused
herself
from
some
such
sad
meditations
and
sought
john
in
the
the
door
was
half
open
and
she
entered
noiselessly
john
was
sitting
at
the
table
his
arms
were
outspread
on
it
and
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
thinking
he
was
asleep
she
approached
on
tiptoe
and
leant
over
his
shoulder
as
she
did
so
her
eyes
fell
on
a
sheet
of
it
was
clutched
in
john
right
hand
and
the
encircling
grasp
covered
it
save
at
the
top
the
top
was
visible
and
mary
before
she
knew
what
she
was
doing
had
read
the
embossed
heading
nothing
else
just
the
embossed
heading
hotel
de
luxe
cannes
alpes
maritimes
the
drama
teaches
us
how
often
a
guilty
mind
rushes
on
some
trifling
cause
to
like
a
flash
came
the
conviction
that
charlie
had
written
to
john
that
her
secret
was
known
and
heartbroken
in
a
moment
she
fell
on
her
knees
crying
oh
how
wicked
i
been
forgive
me
do
forgive
me
oh
john
can
you
forgive
me
john
was
not
asleep
he
also
was
merely
meditating
but
if
he
had
been
a
very
rip
van
winkle
this
cry
of
agony
would
have
roused
him
he
started
violently
as
well
he
might
from
his
seat
looked
at
mary
and
crumpled
the
letter
into
a
shapeless
ball
you
did
see
he
asked
hoarsely
no
but
i
know
i
mean
i
saw
the
heading
and
knew
it
must
be
from
him
oh
john
from
him
yes
he
he
staying
there
oh
john
really
i
never
see
or
speak
to
him
again
really
i
wo
oh
you
can
trust
me
john
see
i
hide
nothing
here
his
letter
you
see
i
sent
him
away
and
she
took
from
her
pocket
charlie
letter
and
in
her
noble
fidelity
to
john
the
less
we
say
about
poor
charlie
the
better
handed
it
to
him
what
this
asked
john
in
bewilderment
who
it
from
charlie
ellerton
she
stammered
who
charlie
ellerton
i
never
heard
but
am
i
to
read
it
yes
please
i
i
think
you
better
john
read
it
mary
followed
his
eyes
and
the
moment
they
reached
the
end
without
giving
him
time
to
speak
she
exclaimed
there
you
see
i
spoke
the
truth
i
had
sent
him
away
what
does
he
say
to
you
john
i
never
heard
of
him
in
my
life
before
john
then
who
is
your
letter
from
he
hesitated
he
felt
an
impulse
to
imitate
her
candor
but
prudence
suggested
that
he
should
be
sure
of
his
ground
first
tell
me
all
he
said
sitting
down
who
is
this
man
and
what
has
he
to
do
with
you
why
do
you
show
me
his
letter
i
do
know
what
he
said
about
me
what
could
he
say
about
you
well
he
he
might
say
that
that
i
cared
for
him
john
and
do
you
demanded
john
and
his
voice
was
anxious
duty
demanded
a
falsehood
mary
did
her
very
best
to
satisfy
its
imperious
commands
it
was
no
use
oh
john
she
murmured
and
then
began
to
cry
for
a
moment
wounded
pride
struggled
with
john
relief
but
then
a
glorious
vision
of
what
this
admission
of
mary
might
mean
to
him
swept
away
his
pique
read
this
he
said
giving
her
dora
bellairs
letter
and
then
we
have
an
explanation
half
an
hour
later
miss
bussey
was
roused
from
a
pleasant
snooze
john
and
mary
stood
beside
her
hand
in
hand
they
wore
brother
and
sister
now
that
was
an
integral
part
of
the
arrangement
and
so
they
stood
hand
in
hand
their
faces
were
radiant
we
came
to
tell
you
auntie
dear
that
we
have
decided
that
we
not
suited
to
one
another
began
mary
not
at
all
said
john
decisively
miss
bussey
stared
helplessly
from
one
to
the
other
it
all
right
miss
bussey
remarked
john
cheerfully
we
had
an
explanation
we
part
by
mutual
consent
john
said
mary
is
to
be
just
my
brother
and
i
his
sister
oh
and
auntie
i
want
to
go
with
him
to
cannes
this
last
suggestion
which
naturally
did
not
appear
to
any
mind
to
harmonize
with
what
had
gone
before
restored
voice
to
miss
bussey
what
the
matter
with
you
are
you
mad
she
demanded
john
sat
down
beside
her
his
friends
anticipated
a
distinguished
parliamentary
career
for
john
he
could
make
anything
sound
reasonable
miss
bussey
was
fascinated
by
his
suave
and
fluent
narrative
of
what
had
befallen
mary
and
himself
she
could
not
but
admire
his
just
remarks
on
the
providential
disclosure
of
the
true
state
of
the
case
before
it
was
too
late
and
sympathized
with
the
picture
of
suffering
nobly
suppressed
which
grew
under
his
skilful
hand
she
was
inflamed
when
he
ardently
declared
his
purpose
of
seeking
out
dora
she
was
touched
when
he
kissed
mary
hand
and
declared
that
the
world
held
no
nobler
woman
before
john
eloquence
even
the
stern
facts
of
a
public
engagement
of
invited
guests
of
dresses
ordered
and
presents
received
lost
their
force
and
the
romantic
spirit
rekindled
held
undivided
sway
in
miss
bussey
heart
but
she
said
why
does
mary
talk
of
going
to
cannes
with
you
ellerton
is
at
cannes
aunt
murmured
mary
shyly
but
you
ca
travel
with
john
oh
but
you
must
come
too
it
looks
as
if
you
were
running
after
him
i
chance
charlie
thinking
that
cried
mary
clasping
her
hands
in
glee
miss
bussey
pretended
to
be
reluctant
to
undertake
the
journey
but
she
was
really
quite
ready
to
yield
and
soon
everything
was
settled
on
the
new
basis
and
now
to
write
and
tell
people
said
miss
bussey
that
the
worst
part
of
it
poor
dear
we
help
cried
mary
but
i
must
write
to
cannes
wire
cried
john
of
course
wire
echoed
mary
the
first
thing
tomorrow
before
breakfast
mary
i
shall
never
forget
no
john
it
you
who
and
they
went
off
in
a
torrent
of
mutual
laudation
miss
bussey
shook
her
head
if
they
think
all
that
of
one
another
why
do
they
marry
she
said
chapter
iv
the
tale
of
a
postmark

lady
deane

no
objection

a
few
days
just
to

dolly
the
sights
how
charming

you

i
must
have
some
expeditions
together
roger
is
so
odd
about
not
liking
to
take
me
we
do
the
whole
thing
lady
deane
answered
general
bellairs
heartily
notre
dame
the
versailles
the
invalides
eiffel
tower
lady
deane
broad
white
brow
showed
a
little
pucker
that
was
quite
what
i
meant
said
she
oh
but
roger
could
take
dora
to
those
could
he
while
you
and
i
made
a
point
of
seeing
some
of
the
real
life
of
the
people
of
studying
them
in
their
ordinary
resorts
their
places
of
recreation
and
amusement
oh
the
francais
and
the
opera
and
so
on
of
course
no
no
no
exclaimed
lady
deane
tapping
her
foot
impatiently
and
fixing
her
gray
eyes
on
the
general
now
puzzled
face
not
the
same
old
treadmill
in
paris
as
in
london
not
that
general
what
then
my
dear
lady
asked
he
your
wish
is
law
to
me
and
it
was
true
that
he
had
become
very
fond
of
his
earnest
young
friend
what
do
you
want
to
see
the
chamber
of
deputies
sir
roger
voice
struck
in
i
not
a
puritanical
husband
bellairs
but
i
must
make
a
stand
somewhere
not
the
chamber
of
deputies
do
be
silly
roger
dear
said
lady
deane
in
her
usual
tone
of
dispassionate
reproof
i
ca
find
out
where
she
does
want
to
go
to
remarked
the
general
i
can
tell
you
said
sir
roger
and
he
leant
down
and
whispered
a
name
in
the
general
ear
the
general
jumped
good
heavens
he
exclaimed
i
have
been
there
since
the
fifties
is
it
still
like
what
it
used
to
be
how
should
i
know
inquired
sir
roger
i
not
a
student
of
social
phenomena
maud
is
so
she
wants
to
go
lady
deane
was
looking
on
with
a
quiet
smile
she
never
mentioned
it
protested
the
general
oh
of
course
if
there
a
worse
place
now
conceded
sir
roger
i
make
up
my
mind
when
we
arrive
observed
lady
deane
anyhow
i
shall
rely
on
you
general
the
general
looked
a
little
uncomfortable
if
deane
does
object
i
should
think
of
taking
my
wife
to
such
places
suddenly
dora
bellairs
rushed
up
to
them
have
you
seen
mr
ellerton
she
cried
where
is
he
in
the
answered
sir
roger
do
you
want
him
would
you
mind
i
ca
go
in
there
it
full
of
men
after
all
we
must
be
somewhere
pleaded
sir
roger
as
he
went
on
his
errand
dolly
said
the
general
i
just
made
a
charming
arrangement
lady
deane
and
sir
roger
start
for
paris
week
and
we
going
with
them
you
said
you
like
another
week
here
it
charming
our
being
able
to
go
together
is
it
said
lady
deane
dora
face
did
not
express
rapture
yet
she
liked
the
deanes
very
much
oh
but
she
began
well
asked
her
father
i
rather
want
to
go
a
little
sooner
i
afraid
said
lady
deane
we
sha
get
roger
to
move
before
then
he
bent
on
seeing
the
tennis
tournament
through
when
did
you
want
to
go
dora
well
in
fact
to
night
my
dear
dolly
what
a
weathercock
you
are
it
impossible
dining
with
the
grand
duke
on
monday
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
stay
young
woman
oh
please
papa
but
why
do
you
want
to
go
asked
the
general
rather
impatiently
dora
had
absolutely
no
producible
reason
for
her
eagerness
to
go
and
yet
oh
if
they
only
knew
what
was
at
stake
we
to
be
married
in
a
fortnight
she
could
see
the
words
dancing
before
her
eyes
and
she
must
waste
a
precious
week
here
do
you
want
me
miss
bellairs
asked
charlie
ellerton
coming
up
to
them
yes
i
want
oh
i
want
to
go
to
rumpelmayer
all
right
come
along
i
delighted
to
go
with
you
they
walked
off
in
silence
dora
was
in
distress
she
saw
that
the
general
was
immovable
suddenly
charlie
turned
to
her
and
remarked
well
it
all
over
with
me
miss
bellairs
what
how
do
you
mean
my
chance
is
gone
they
to
be
married
in
a
fortnight
i
had
a
letter
to
say
so
this
morning
dora
turned
suddenly
to
him
oh
but
it
too
extraordinary
she
cried
so
had
i
what
why
a
letter
to
say
they
were
to
be
married
in
a
fortnight
nonsense
yes
ellerton
who
who
is
your
friend
her
name
mary
travers
and
who
is
she
going
to
marry
ah
she
has
told
me
that
a
suspicion
of
the
truth
struck
them
both
charlie
produced
his
letter
she
writes
he
said
showing
the
postmark
from
dittington
it
is
it
is
she
cried
it
must
be
mary
travers
that
ashforth
is
going
to
marry
is
that
your
friend
yes
is
she
pretty
mr
ellerton
oh
awfully
what
sort
of
a
fellow
is
he
splendid
is
it
a
deuced
queer
thing
most
extraordinary
and
when
we
told
one
another
we
never
thought
how
could
we
well
no
we
could
of
course
a
pause
followed
then
charlie
observed
i
suppose
there
nothing
to
be
done
nothing
to
be
done
ellerton
why
if
i
were
a
man
i
leave
for
england
tonight
and
why
ca
you
papa
wo
but
you
might
ye
es
i
suppose
i
might
it
would
look
rather
odd
would
it
why
you
yourself
suggested
it
yes
but
the
marriage
was
a
long
way
off
then
there
the
more
reason
now
for
haste
of
course
that
true
but
oh
if
papa
would
only
take
me
a
sudden
idea
seemed
to
strike
charlie
he
assumed
an
air
of
chivalrous
sympathy
when
shall
you
go
he
asked
not
till
week
she
said
we
sha
get
to
england
till
three
or
four
days
before
it
dora
knew
nothing
of
the
proposed
stay
in
paris
look
here
miss
bellairs
said
charlie
we
agreed
to
stand
by
one
another
i
shall
wait
and
go
when
you
do
but
think
i
thought
you
risking
everything
if
she
break
it
off
ten
days
before
she
do
the
same
four
days
before
if
she
really
loves
you
she
will
anyhow
we
stand
or
fall
together
oh
i
ought
to
let
you
but
i
ca
refuse
how
kind
you
are
then
that
settled
said
charlie
and
we
must
try
to
console
one
another
till
then
the
suspense
is
awful
is
it
of
course
but
we
must
appear
cheerful
we
must
betray
ourselves
not
for
the
world
i
can
never
thank
you
enough
you
come
with
us
all
the
way
yes
thank
you
again
she
gave
him
her
hand
which
he
pressed
gently
hullo
said
he
we
seem
to
have
got
up
by
the
church
somewhere
where
were
we
going
to
why
to
rumpelmayer
oh
ah
well
let
go
back
to
the
hotel
wonderings
on
the
extraordinary
coincidence
with
an
occasional
reference
to
the
tender
tie
of
a
common
sorrow
which
bound
them
together
beguiled
the
journey
back
and
when
they
reached
the
hotel
dora
was
quite
calm
charlie
seemed
distinctly
cheerful
and
when
his
companion
left
him
he
sat
down
by
deane
and
remarked
in
a
careless
way
just
as
if
he
neither
knew
nor
cared
what
the
rest
of
them
were
going
to
do
well
i
shall
light
out
of
here
in
a
few
days
i
suppose
you
staying
some
time
longer
off
in
a
week
said
sir
roger
oh
by
jove
that
about
my
mark
going
back
to
england
yes
i
suppose
so
ultimately
we
shall
stay
a
few
days
in
paris
en
route
the
bellairs
go
with
us
oh
do
they
sir
roger
smiled
gently
surprised
he
asked
charlie
ignored
the
question
and
you
are
going
to
hurry
he
inquired
why
should
we
charlie
sat
silent
it
was
tolerably
plain
that
unless
the
few
days
en
route
were
very
few
indeed
john
ashforth
and
mary
travers
were
in
a
fair
way
to
be
prosperously
and
peacefully
married
before
dora
bellairs
set
foot
in
england
and
if
he
stayed
with
the
bellairs
before
he
did
either
charlie
lit
a
cigarette
and
sat
puffing
and
thinking
dashed
nice
girl
dora
bellairs
observed
sir
roger
think
so
i
do
she
the
only
girl
i
ever
saw
that
laing
was
smitten
with
laing
said
charlie
well
what
the
matter
he
an
uncommon
good
chap
laing
one
of
the
best
chaps
i
know
and
he
got
lots
of
coin
i
do
expect
sneeze
at
laing
it
is
no
doubt
taking
a
very
serious
responsibility
to
upset
an
arrangement
arrived
at
deliberately
and
carried
almost
to
a
conclusion
a
man
should
be
very
sure
that
he
can
make
a
woman
happy
happier
than
any
other
man
he
asks
her
to
face
the
turmoil
and
the
scandal
of
breaking
off
her
marriage
only
a
week
before
its
celebration
sure
as
he
may
be
of
his
own
affection
he
must
be
equally
sure
of
hers
equally
sure
that
their
mutual
love
is
deep
and
permanent
he
must
consider
his
claims
to
demand
such
a
sacrifice
what
remorse
will
be
his
if
afterwards
he
discovers
that
what
he
did
was
not
in
truth
for
her
real
happiness
he
must
be
on
his
guard
against
mere
selfishness
or
mere
vanity
masquerading
in
the
garb
of
a
genuine
passion
as
these
thoughts
occurred
to
charlie
ellerton
he
felt
that
he
was
at
a
crisis
of
his
life
he
also
felt
glad
that
he
had
still
a
quiet
week
at
cannes
in
which
to
revolve
these
considerations
in
his
mind
above
all
he
must
do
nothing
hastily
dora
came
out
a
book
in
her
hand
her
soft
white
frock
fluttered
in
the
breeze
and
she
pushed
back
a
loose
lock
of
dark
hair
that
caressed
her
check
a
dashed
nice
girl
upon
my
honor
said
sir
roger
deane
oh
very
i
say
old
chap
i
suppose
you
in
no
hurry
you
put
in
a
few
days
in
paris
we
might
have
a
day
out
might
we
i
do
know
yet
said
charlie
and
when
deane
left
him
he
sat
on
in
solitude
was
it
possible
that
in
the
space
of
a
week
no
it
was
impossible
and
yet
with
a
girl
like
that
i
did
the
right
thing
in
waiting
to
go
with
her
anyhow
said
charlie
comforting
himself
chapter
v
a
second
edition
do
you
think
it
an
interesting
sort
of
title
inquired
lady
deane
of
laing
laing
was
always
a
little
uneasy
in
her
presence
he
felt
not
only
that
she
was
analyzing
him
but
that
the
results
of
the
analysis
seemed
to
her
to
be
a
very
small
residuum
of
solid
matter
besides
he
had
been
told
that
she
had
described
him
as
a
commonplace
young
man
a
thing
nobody
could
be
expected
to
like
capital
he
answered
nervously
fingering
his

the

of

capital
i
think
it
will
do
said
lady
deane
complacently
er
what
was
he
transformed
into
lady
deane
a
man
replied
the
lady
emphatically
of
course
i
see
murmured
laing
apologetically
stifling
a
desire
to
ask
what
giles
had
been
before
a
moment
later
the
author
enlightened
him
yes
said
she
into
a
man
from
a
useless
mischievous
contemptible
idler
a
parasite
laing
a
creature
to
whom
what
did
it
lady
deane
interrupted
laing
hastily
he
felt
somehow
as
if
he
were
being
catalogued
just
a
woman
influence
laing
face
displayed
relief
he
felt
that
he
was
in
his
depth
again
oh
got
married
you
mean
well
of
course
he
have
to
pull
up
a
bit
would
he
hang
it
i
think
it
a
fellow
duty
you
do
quite
understand
me
observed
lady
deane
coldly
he
did
not
marry
the
woman
what
did
she
give
him
the
i
mean
would
she
have
him
lady
deane
she
would
have
married
him
but
beside
her
he
saw
himself
in
his
true
colors
knowing
what
he
was
how
could
he
dare
that
was
his
punishment
and
punishment
brought
transformation
as
lady
deane
sketched
her
idea
her
eyes
kindled
and
her
tone
became
animated
laing
admired
both
her
and
her
idea
and
he
expressed
his
feeling
by
saying
remarkable
sort
of
chap
lady
deane
i
shall
read
it
all
right
you
know
i
think
you
ought
said
she
rising
and
leaving
him
to
wonder
whether
she
had
meant
anything
he
gave
himself
a
little
shake
as
though
to
escape
from
the
atmosphere
of
seriousness
which
she
had
diffused
about
him
and
looked
round
a
little
way
off
he
saw
dora
bellairs
and
charlie
ellerton
sitting
side
by
side
his
brow
clouded
before
charlie
came
it
had
been
his
privilege
to
be
miss
bellairs
cavalier
and
although
he
never
hoped
nor
to
tell
the
truth
desired
more
than
a
temporary
favor
in
her
eyes
he
did
not
quite
like
being
ousted
pretty
good
for
a
fellow
who
just
had
the
bag
he
remarked
scornfully
referring
to
roger
deane
unauthorized
revelation
it
was
the
day
before
the
exodus
to
paris
dora
period
of
weary
waiting
had
worn
itself
away
and
she
was
acknowledging
to
charlie
that
the
last
two
or
three
days
had
passed
quicker
than
she
had
ever
thought
they
could
the
first
two
days
i
was
wretched
the
next
two
gloomy
but
these
last
almost
peaceful
in
spite
of
you
know
what
i
think
you
done
me
good
on
the
whole
do
mention
it
said
charlie
flinging
his
arm
over
the
back
of
the
seat
and
looking
at
his
companion
and
now
in
the
end
pursued
dora
i
actually
a
little
sorry
to
leave
all
this
it
so
beautiful
and
she
waved
her
parasol
vaguely
at
the
hills
and
the
islands
while
with
the
other
hand
she
took
off
her
hat
and
allowed
the
breeze
to
blow
through
her
hair
it
is
jolly
is
it
she
asked
i
should
rather
think
it
was
said
charlie
the
jolliest
i
ever
seen
it
was
evident
that
he
did
not
refer
to
the
scenery
oh
you
promised
you
would
cried
dora
reproachfully
well
then
i
promise
again
he
replied
smiling
amiably
what
must
i
think
of
you
when
only
a
week
or
so
ago
oh
and
what
must
you
think
of
me
to
suppose
i
could
oh
mr
ellerton
like
to
know
what
i
think
of
you
inquired
charlie
quite
unperturbed
by
this
passionate
rebuke
certainly
not
said
she
with
dignity
and
turned
away
a
moment
later
however
she
attacked
him
again
and
you
done
nothing
she
said
indignantly
but
suggest
to
papa
interesting
places
to
stop
at
on
the
way
and
things
he
ought
to
see
in
paris
yes
and
you
actually
suggested
going
home
by
sea
from
marseilles
and
all
the
time
you
knew
it
was
vital
to
me
to
get
home
as
soon
as
possible
to
me
yes
and
to
you
shall
i
tell
you
something
mr
ellerton
please
said
charlie
whisper
it
in
my
ear
and
he
offered
his
head
in
fitting
proximity
i
should
mind
who
heard
she
declared
i
despise
you
mr
ellerton
charlie
was
roused
to
a
protest
for
downright
unfairness
give
me
a
girl
said
he
here
have
i
taken
the
manly
course
after
a
short
period
of
weakness
i
admit
that
i
have
conquered
my
feelings
i
have
determined
not
to
distress
miss
travers
by
intruding
upon
her
i
have
overcome
the
promptings
of
a
cowardly
despair
i
have
turned
my
back
resolutely
on
a
past
devoid
of
hope
i
am
after
a
sore
struggle
myself
again
and
my
reward
miss
bellairs
is
to
be
told
that
you
despise
me
upon
my
honor
you
be
despising
simon
stylites
next
and
you
wrote
and
told
miss
travers
you
were
coming
all
right
i
shall
write
and
toll
her
i
not
coming
i
shall
say
miss
bellairs
that
it
seems
to
me
to
be
an
undignified
thing
to
do
what
i
going
to
do
thank
you
mr
ellerton
oh
i
forgot
the
irony
of
it
is
that
you
persuaded
me
to
do
it
yourself
i
was
a
fool
but
i
did
know
you
so
well
then
what
that
got
to
do
with
it
everything
you
did
know
yourself
i
afraid
she
remarked
you
thought
you
were
a
man
of
some
some
depth
of
feeling
some
constancy
a
man
whose
whose
regard
a
girl
would
value
instead
of
being
just
a
poor
devil
who
worships
the
ground
you
tread
on
dora
laughed
scornfully
second
edition
said
she
the
first
dedicated
to
miss
travers
and
then
charlie
and
it
is
thing
like
these
which
shake
that
faith
in
human
nature
that
we
try
to
cling
to
said
in
a
low
but
quite
distinct
voice
oh
d
n
miss
travers
dora
shot
it
almost
looked
as
if
something
had
shot
her
as
it
used
in
old
days
miss
zazel
up
from
her
seat
i
thought
i
was
talking
to
a
said
she
i
suppose
use
that
expression
about
me
in
a
week
in
a
good
deal
less
if
you
treat
me
like
this
said
charlie
and
his
air
was
one
of
hopeless
misery
we
all
recollect
that
anne
ended
by
being
tolerably
kind
to
wicked
king
richard
after
all
charlie
had
the
same
excuse
i
do
want
to
be
unkind
said
dora
more
gently
i
do
anything
in
the
world
to
please
you
then
make
papa
go
straight
to
paris
and
straight
on
from
paris
said
dora
using
her
power
mercilessly
oh
i
say
i
did
mean
that
miss
bellairs
you
said
you
do
anything
i
liked
charlie
looked
at
her
thoughtfully
i
suppose
you
no
pity
he
inquired
for
you
not
a
bit
you
probably
do
know
how
beautiful
you
are
do
be
foolish
and
and
impertinent
she
was
standing
opposite
to
him
with
a
sudden
motion
he
sprang
forward
fell
on
one
knee
seized
her
ungloved
hand
covered
it
with
kisses
sprang
up
and
hastened
away
crying
as
he
went
all
right
i
do
it
dora
stood
where
he
left
her
first
she
looked
at
her
hand
then
at
charlie
retreating
back
then
again
at
her
hand
her
cheek
was
flushed
and
she
trembled
a
little
john
never
did
that
she
said
at
least
not
without
asking
and
even
then
not
quite
like
that
she
walked
on
slowly
then
stopped
and
exclaimed
i
wonder
if
he
ever
did
that
to
mary
travers
and
her
last
reflection
was
poor
boy
he
must
be
oh
dear
me
when
charlie
reached
the
he
was
considering
the
moving
scene
through
which
he
had
passed
wonderfully
calm
in
fact
he
was
smiling
and
whistling
espying
sir
roger
deane
he
went
and
sat
down
by
him
roger
said
he
i
going
with
you
and
the
bellairs
i
know
that
miss
bellairs
wants
to
go
straight
through
to
england
without
stopping
anywhere
she
have
to
want
i
expect
and
i
promised
to
try
and
get
the
general
to
do
what
she
wants
have
you
though
i
suppose
roger
old
fellow
you
know
you
great
influence
with
him
i
suppose
it
no
use
asking
you
to
say
a
word
to
him
not
a
bit
why
because
maud
particularly
wants
him
to
stay
with
us
in
paris
oh
of
course
if
lady
deane
wishes
it
i
must
say
a
word
quite
made
up
her
mind
about
it
has
she
well
i
suppose
so
she
strong
on
it
i
mean
not
likely
to
change
i
think
not
charlie
she
ask
him
to
stay
as
a
favor
to
her
i
should
at
all
wonder
oh
well
then
my
asking
him
wo
make
much
difference
frankly
i
do
see
why
it
should
thanks
i
only
wanted
to
know
you
not
in
a
hurry
roger
i
mean
you
wo
ask
your
wife
to
go
straight
on
no
i
sha
charlie
i
want
to
stop
myself
thanks
old
chap
see
you
at
dinner
and
charlie
strolled
off
with
a
reassured
air
sir
roger
sat
and
thought
i
see
his
game
he
said
to
himself
at
last
but
i
hanged
if
i
see
hers
why
does
she
want
to
get
back
to
england
perhaps
if
i
delay
her
as
much
as
i
can
she
tell
me
hanged
if
i
do
anyhow
i
glad
to
see
old
charlie
getting
convalescent
the
next
morning
the
whole
party
left
cannes
by
the
early
train
the
bellairs
the
deanes
and
charlie
ellerton
travelled
together
laing
announced
his
intention
of
following
by
the
afternoon
train
oh
said
lady
deane
you
get
to
paris
sooner
than
we
do
dora
looked
gloomy
so
did
charlie
after
a
momentary
hastily
smothered
smile
the
porter
approached
and
asked
for
an
address
they
told
him
the
grand
hotel
paris
if
anything
comes
i
bring
it
on
said
laing
yes
do
we
shall
have
no
address
before
paris
answered
general
bellairs
they
drove
off
and
laing
feeling
rather
solitary
returned
to
his
cigar
an
hour
later
the
waiter
brought
him
two
telegrams
one
for
dora
and
one
for
charlie
he
looked
at
the
addresses
just
too
late
by
jove
all
right
gar√ßon
i
take
and
he
thrust
them
into
the
pocket
of
his
flannel
jacket
and
when
after
lunch
he
could
not
stand
the
dullness
any
longer
and
went
to
monte
carlo
he
left
the
telegrams
in
the
discarded
flannels
where
they
lay
till
the
time
when
they
were
discovered
for
laing
clean
forgot
all
about
them
chapter
vi
a
man
with
a
theory
even
miss
bussey
was
inclined
to
think
that
all
had
happened
for
the
best
john
eloquence
had
shaken
her
first
disapprobation
the
visible
happiness
of
the
persons
chiefly
concerned
pleaded
yet
more
persuasively
what
harm
after
all
was
done
except
for
a
little
trouble
and
a
little
gossip
to
these
mary
and
john
were
utterly
indifferent
at
first
they
had
been
rather
shy
in
referring
before
one
another
to
their
loves
but
custom
taught
them
to
mention
the
names
without
confusion
and
ere
long
they
had
exchanged
confidences
as
to
their
future
plans
john
arrangement
was
obviously
the
more
prudent
and
becoming
he
discountenanced
mary
suggestion
of
an
unannounced
descent
on
cannes
and
persuaded
her
to
follow
his
example
and
inform
her
lover
that
she
would
await
news
from
him
in
paris
they
were
to
put
up
at
the
european
and
telegrams
there
from
cannes
would
rind
them
on
and
after
april
all
this
valuable
information
was
contained
in
the
dispatches
which
lay
with
their
priceless
messages
on
the
said
april
in
arthur
laing
flannel
jacket
inside
his
portmanteau
on
the
way
to
paris
paris
claims
to
be
the
centre
of
the
world
and
if
it
be
the
world
has
a
very
good
centre
anyhow
paris
becomes
from
this
moment
the
centre
of
this
drama
not
only
was
arthur
laing
being
whirled
there
by
the
nice
express
and
miss
bussey
party
proceeding
thither
by
the
eleven
train
from
victoria
mary
laughed
as
she
thought
it
might
have
been
her
honeymoon
she
was
starting
on
but
the
bellairs
and
their
friends
were
heading
for
the
same
point
miss
bussey
party
had
the
pleasanter
journey
they
were
all
of
one
mind
miss
bussey
was
eager
to
reach
paris
because
it
was
the
end
of
the
journey
john
and
mary
desired
nothing
but
the
moment
when
with
trembling
fingers
they
should
tear
open
their
telegrams
in
the
hall
of
the
hotel
the
expedition
from
the
south
did
not
enjoy
a
like
unanimity
but
before
following
their
steps
we
may
in
the
interest
of
simplicity
land
the
first
detachment
safely
at
its
destination
when
mary
and
john
followed
by
miss
bussey
they
outstripped
her
in
their
eagerness
entered
the
hotel
a
young
man
with
an
was
just
engaging
a
bedroom
john
took
his
place
beside
the
stranger
and
asked
in
a
voice
which
he
strove
to
render
calm
if
there
were
any
letters
for
beg
pardon
sir
in
one
moment
said
the
clerk
and
he
added
to
laing
number
sir
laing
oh
the
irony
of
things
turned
on
john
and
his
companion
just
that
one
supercilious
glance
which
we
bestow
on
other
tourists
and
followed
his
baggage
upstairs
anything
resumed
john
for
miss
travers
or
mr
ashforth
and
he
succeeded
in
looking
as
if
he
did
not
care
a
straw
whether
there
were
or
not
after
a
search
the
porter
answered
nothing
sir
what
exclaimed
john
aghast
oh
nonsense
look
again
another
search
followed
it
was
without
result
john
saw
mary
appealing
eyes
fixed
on
him
nothing
he
said
tragically
oh
john
have
you
taken
the
rooms
ash
forth
inquired
miss
bussey
no
i
sorry
i
forgot
all
about
them
miss
bussey
was
tired
she
had
been
seasick
and
the
train
always
made
her
feel
queer
has
neither
of
you
got
an
ounce
of
wits
about
you
she
demanded
and
plunged
forward
to
the
desk
john
and
mary
received
their
numbers
in
gloomy
silence
and
mounted
the
stairs
now
arthur
laing
in
his
hasty
survey
of
the
party
had
arrived
at
a
not
unnatural
but
wholly
erroneous
conclusion
he
had
seen
a
young
man
rather
nervous
a
young
woman
looking
anxious
and
shy
and
an
elderly
person
plainly
dressed
miss
bussey
was
no
dandy
sitting
miss
bussey
always
sat
as
soon
as
she
could
on
a
trunk
he
took
john
and
mary
for
a
newly
married
couple
and
miss
bussey
for
an
old
family
servant
detailed
to
look
after
her
young
mistress
entry
into
independent
housekeeping
more
infernal
honeymooners
he
said
to
himself
as
he
washed
his
hands
the
place
is
always
full
of
girl
was
though
the
next
morning
unhappily
confirmed
him
in
his
mistake
for
miss
bussey
overcome
by
the
various
trials
of
the
day
before
kept
her
bed
and
when
laing
came
down
the
first
sight
which
met
his
eyes
was
a
whereat
mary
and
john
sat
he
eyed
them
with
that
mixture
of
scorn
and
envy
which
their
supposed
situation
awakens
in
a
bachelor
heart
and
took
a
place
from
which
he
could
survey
them
at
leisure
there
is
a
bright
side
to
everything
and
that
of
laing
mistake
was
the
pleasure
he
derived
from
his
delusion
sticking
his
glass
firmly
in
his
eye
he
watched
like
a
cat
for
those
playful
little
endearments
which
his
cynical
mood
he
was
like
many
of
us
not
at
his
best
in
the
morning
led
him
to
anticipate
he
watched
in
vain
the
young
people
were
decorum
itself
more
than
that
they
showed
signs
of
preoccupation
they
spoke
only
occasionally
and
then
with
a
brevity
suddenly
the
waiter
entered
with
a
hand
fid
of
letters
which
he
proceeded
to
distribute
laing
expected
none
and
kept
his
gaze
on
his
honeymooners
to
his
surprise
they
showed
animation
enough
now
their
eyes
were
first
on
the
waiter
approaching
form
the
bridegroom
even
rose
an
inch
or
two
from
his
seat
both
stretched
out
their
hands
alas
with
a
little
bow
a
smile
and
a
shrug
the
waiter
passed
by
and
the
disappointed
couple
sank
back
with
looks
of
blank
despair
surely
here
was
enough
to
set
any
man
on
the
right
track
yes
but
not
enough
to
free
one
who
was
tied
and
bound
to
his
own
theory
she
dashed
anxious
to
hoar
from
home
mused
laing
poor
girl
it
ai
over
and
above
flattering
to
him
though
he
finished
his
breakfast
and
went
out
to
smoke
presently
he
saw
his
friends
come
out
also
they
went
to
the
porter
desk
and
he
hoard
one
of
them
say
telegram
a
sudden
idea
struck
him
i
am
an
ass
said
he
tell
you
what
it
is
they
wired
for
rooms
somewhere
monte
most
likely
and
ca
start
till
they
get
an
answer
he
was
so
pleased
with
his
explanation
that
his
last
doubt
vanished
and
he
watched
mary
and
john
start
for
a
walk
the
fraternal
relations
they
had
established
would
have
allowed
such
a
thing
even
in
london
much
more
in
paris
with
quite
a
benevolent
smile
aunt
sarah
is
really
quite
poorly
remarked
mary
as
they
crossed
the
road
and
entered
the
tuileries
gardens
she
have
to
stay
in
all
and
perhaps
tomorrow
is
it
hard
upon
her
paris
amuses
her
so
much
john
expressed
his
sympathy
now
if
it
had
been
you
or
i
he
ended
we
should
have
minded
paris
does
amuse
us
just
now
oh
but
john
we
must
be
ready
to
start
at
any
moment
you
ca
start
without
miss
bussey
i
think
that
in
a
began
mary
but
what
the
good
of
talking
cried
john
bitterly
why
is
there
no
news
from
her
he
have
wired
john
is
it
possible
our
telegrams
went
astray
well
we
must
wait
a
day
or
two
or
if
you
like
we
can
wire
again
mary
hesitated
i
i
ca
do
that
john
suppose
he
received
the
first
and
and
yes
i
see
i
do
want
to
humiliate
myself
either
we
wait
a
day
anyhow
and
now
john
let
think
no
more
about
them
oh
well
that
nonsense
but
let
enjoys
ourselves
as
well
as
we
can
they
managed
to
enjoy
themselves
very
well
the
town
was
new
to
mary
and
john
found
a
pleasure
in
showing
it
off
to
her
after
a
morning
of
they
drove
in
the
bois
and
ended
the
day
at
the
theatre
miss
bussey
unfortunately
was
no
better
she
had
sent
for
an
english
doctor
and
he
talked
vaguely
about
two
or
three
days
in
bed
mary
ventured
to
ask
whether
her
aunt
could
travel
oh
if
absolutely
necessary
perhaps
but
much
better
not
was
the
answer
well
it
was
not
absolutely
necessary
yet
for
no
letter
and
no
telegram
arrived
this
was
the
awful
fact
that
greeted
them
when
they
came
in
from
the
theatre
we
wire
the
first
thing
declared
john
in
a
resolute
tone
write
yours
mary
and
i
give
them
to
the
porter
oh
not
mine
please
cried
mary
in
shrinking
bashfulness
i
let
the
porter
see
mine
well
then
we
take
them
out
before
breakfast
to
this
mary
agreed
and
they
sat
down
and
wrote
their
dispatches
while
they
were
so
engaged
laing
jumped
out
of
a
cab
and
entered
the
room
he
seized
an
english
paper
and
flinging
himself
into
a
chair
began
to
study
the
sporting
news
presently
he
stole
a
glance
at
mary
it
so
chanced
that
just
at
the
same
moment
she
was
stealing
a
glance
at
him
mary
dropped
her
eyes
with
a
blush
laing
withdrew
behind
his
paper
shy
of
course
anybody
would
be
he
thought
with
a
smile
did
you
like
the
piece
mary
asked
john
oh
very
much
i
wish
aunt
sarah
could
have
seen
it
she
missed
so
much
fun
well
she
could
hardly
have
come
with
us
could
she
remarked
john
oh
no
said
mary
well
i
should
rather
think
not
whispered
laing
who
failed
to
identify
sarah
with
the
elderly
person
on
the
trunk
i
should
have
been
happy
if
she
had
said
mary
i
simply
would
have
let
her
said
john
in
that
authoritative
tone
which
so
well
became
him
no
more
would
i
in
your
place
old
chap
murmured
laing
mary
rose
thanks
for
all
your
kindness
john
i
so
glad
you
had
a
pleasant
day
mary
so
they
parted
with
a
as
calm
as
decorous
as
frankly
fraternal
as
one
could
wish
or
wish
otherwise
yet
its
very
virtues
undid
it
in
the
prematurely
suspicious
eyes
of
arthur
laing
for
no
sooner
was
he
left
alone
than
he
threw
down
his
paper
and
began
to
chuckle
all
for
my
benefit
that
eh
mary
john
lord
lord
and
he
rose
lit
a
cigarette
and
ordered
a
and
ever
and
again
he
smiled
he
felt
very
acute
indeed
so
vain
is
it
for
either
wisdom
or
simplicity
candor
or
diplomacy
nay
for
facts
themselves
to
struggle
against
a
man
with
a
theory
laing
went
to
bed
no
more
doubting
that
mary
and
john
were
man
and
wife
than
he
doubted
that
he
had
the
winner
of
the
derby
certitude
could
no
farther
go
chapter
vii
the
sights
of
avignon
it
a
curious
thing
observed
roger
deane
but
this
fellow
baedeker
always
travels
the
opposite
way
to
what
i
do
when
i
coming
back
he
always
going
out
and
vice
versa
it
makes
him
precious
difficult
to
understand
i
can
tell
you
miss
dora
however
i
think
i
got
him
now
listen
to
this
to
arles
amphitheatre
starred
one
day
arles
to
avignon
palace
of
the
popes
starred
two
days
slow
going
that
avignon
to
do
you
want
to
in
this
wretched
country
sir
roger
demanded
dora
angrily
a
faint
smile
played
round
sir
roger
lips
you
the
only
one
who
in
a
hurry
he
remarked
no
i
not
ellerton
is
in
just
as
much
of
a
hurry
then
he
bears
disappointment
better
what
in
the
world
did
papa
and
well
and
lady
deane
you
know
want
to
stop
here
for
you
do
seem
to
understand
how
interesting
marseilles
is
let
me
read
you
a
passage
was
a
colony
founded
about
what
oh
all
right
we
skip
a
bit
hordes
of
were
sent
hence
to
paris
where
they
committed
frightful
excesses
that
what
maud
and
your
father
are
going
to
do
was
for
them
that
rouget
i
say
what
the
matter
miss
dora
i
do
know
why
you
should
enjoy
teasing
me
but
you
nearly
made
me
cry
so
perhaps
you
be
happy
now
you
tried
to
take
me
in
i
pretended
to
be
taken
in
that
all
well
it
was
very
unkind
of
you
so
after
all
it
not
a
matter
of
indifference
to
you
at
what
rate
we
travel
as
you
said
in
the
train
oh
i
had
to
i
i
could
let
papa
see
and
why
are
you
in
a
hurry
i
ca
tell
you
but
i
must
oh
i
must
be
in
england
in
four
days
you
hardly
get
your
father
to
give
up
a
day
at
avignon
well
one
day
there
then
we
should
just
do
it
if
we
only
slept
in
paris
yes
but
my
wife
oh
you
can
stay
do
say
anything
about
paris
yet
help
me
to
get
there
i
make
papa
go
on
please
do
sir
roger
i
shall
be
so
awfully
obliged
to
you
so
will
mr
ellerton
charlie
ellerton
not
he
he
in
no
hurry
what
do
you
mean
did
you
hear
him
urging
papa
to
travel
straight
through
oh
yes
i
heard
that
well
you
were
there
then
what
of
that
he
not
so
pressing
when
you
away
i
do
understand
why
should
he
pretend
to
be
in
a
hurry
when
he
is
ah
i
do
know
do
you
not
in
the
least
sir
roger
but
never
mind
ellerton
will
you
help
me
as
far
as
paris
you
must
look
out
for
yourself
there
these
terms
dora
accepted
surely
at
paris
she
would
hear
some
news
of
or
from
john
ashforth
she
thought
he
must
have
written
one
line
in
response
to
her
last
letter
and
that
his
answer
must
have
been
so
far
delayed
as
to
arrive
at
cannes
after
her
departure
it
would
be
waiting
for
her
at
paris
and
would
tell
her
whether
she
was
in
time
or
whether
there
was
no
more
use
in
hurrying
the
dread
that
oppressed
her
was
lest
arriving
too
late
in
paris
she
should
find
that
she
had
missed
happiness
by
reason
of
this
wretched
dawdling
in
southern
france
seeing
her
meditative
deane
slipped
away
to
his
cigar
and
she
sat
in
the
hotel
hall
musing
deane
revelation
of
charlie
treachery
hardly
surprised
her
she
meant
to
upbraid
him
severely
but
she
was
conscious
that
if
little
surprised
she
was
hardly
more
than
a
little
angry
his
conduct
was
indeed
contemptible
it
revealed
an
utter
instability
and
fickleness
of
mind
which
made
her
gravely
uneasy
as
to
mary
travers
chances
of
permanent
happiness
yes
scornful
one
might
b
but
who
could
be
seriously
angry
with
the
poor
boy
and
perhaps
after
all
she
did
him
injustice
some
natures
were
more
prone
than
others
to
sudden
passions
it
really
did
not
follow
that
a
feeling
must
be
either
shallow
or
because
it
was
sudden
whether
it
survived
or
passed
away
would
depend
chiefly
on
the
person
who
excited
it
it
was
clear
that
mary
travers
was
incapable
of
maintaining
a
permanent
hold
over
charlie
affections
but
another
girl
might
might
have
if
so
it
would
perhaps
be
a
pity
if
charlie
and
mary
travers
were
to
come
together
again
she
doubted
very
much
if
they
were
suited
to
one
another
she
pictured
mary
as
a
severe
rather
stern
young
woman
and
she
hardly
knew
whether
to
laugh
or
groan
at
the
thought
of
charlie
adapting
himself
to
such
a
mate
meanwhile
her
own
position
was
certainly
very
difficult
and
she
acknowledged
its
thorniness
with
a
little
sigh
to
begin
with
the
suspense
was
terrible
at
times
she
would
have
been
almost
relieved
to
hear
that
john
was
married
beyond
recall
then
charlie
was
a
great
and
a
growing
difficulty
he
had
not
actually
repeated
the
passionate
indiscretion
of
which
he
had
been
guilty
at
cannes
but
more
and
more
watchfulness
and
severity
were
needed
to
keep
him
within
the
bounds
proper
to
their
relative
positions
and
it
was
odious
to
be
disagreeable
to
a
especially
when
he
was
such
a
good
and
devoted
friend
as
charlie
sir
roger
loyally
carried
out
his
bargain
lady
deane
was
hurried
on
leaving
marseilles
with
its
varied
types
of
humanity
and
its
profound
social
significance
practically
unexplored
aries
and
amphitheatre
in
spite
of
the
beckoning
star
were
dropped
out
of
the
programme
and
the
next
day
found
the
party
at
avignon
and
now
they
were
once
more
for
a
moment
in
harmony
dora
could
spare
hours
lady
deane
and
the
general
were
mollified
by
conscious
unselfishness
the
prospect
of
a
fresh
struggle
at
paris
lay
well
in
the
background
and
was
discreetly
ignored
charlie
ellerton
who
had
reached
the
most
desperate
stage
of
love
looked
neither
back
nor
forward
it
was
enough
for
him
to
have
wrung
hours
of
dora
company
from
fate
reluctant
grasp
he
meant
to
make
the
most
of
it
she
and
he
sat
on
the
afternoon
of
their
arrival
in
the
gardens
hard
by
the
cathedral
where
lady
deane
and
the
general
wore
doing
their
duty
sir
roger
had
chartered
a
cab
and
gone
for
a
drive
on
the
boulevards
and
we
shall
really
be
in
paris
night
said
dora
and
in
england
i
hope
hours
afterwards
i
want
papa
to
cross
the
next
evening
ellerton
i
believe
we
shall
be
in
time
charlie
said
nothing
he
seemed
to
be
engrossed
by
the
magnificent
view
before
him
well
have
you
nothing
to
say
she
asked
it
a
sin
to
rush
through
a
place
like
this
he
observed
we
ought
to
stay
a
week
there
no
end
to
see
it
an
education
by
way
probably
of
making
the
most
of
his
brief
opportunity
he
went
on
gazing
across
the
river
which
flowed
below
now
towards
the
heights
of
mont
ventoux
now
at
the
ramparts
of
villeneuve
dora
on
the
other
hand
fixed
pensive
eyes
on
his
curly
hatless
head
which
leant
forward
as
he
rested
his
elbows
on
his
knees
he
had
referred
to
the
attractions
of
avignon
in
tones
of
almost
overpowering
emotion
presently
he
turned
his
head
towards
her
with
a
quick
jerk
i
do
want
to
be
in
time
he
said
and
with
equal
rapidity
he
returned
to
his
survey
of
villeneuve
dora
made
no
answer
unless
a
perplexed
wrinkle
on
her
brow
might
serve
for
one
a
long
silence
followed
it
was
broken
at
last
by
charlie
he
left
the
landscape
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
as
though
he
could
not
reproach
himself
with
having
neglected
it
and
directed
his
gaze
into
his
companion
eyes
dora
blushed
and
pulled
the
brim
of
her
hat
a
little
lower
down
over
her
brow
what
more
said
charlie
in
deliberate
tones
and
as
if
no
pause
had
occurred
between
this
remark
and
his
last
i
do
believe
you
do
dora
started
and
straightened
herself
in
her
seat
it
looked
as
if
the
rash
remark
were
to
be
met
with
a
burst
of
indignation
but
a
second
later
she
leant
back
again
and
smiled
scornfully
how
can
you
be
so
silly
mr
ellerton
she
asked
we
both
of
us
pursued
charlie
see
now
that
we
made
up
our
minds
to
be
very
foolish
we
both
of
us
mistook
our
real
feelings
beginning
at
least
i
began
some
time
ago
and
you
beginning
now
to
understand
the
true
state
of
affairs
oh
i
know
what
you
mean
and
i
ought
to
be
very
angry
i
suppose
but
it
too
absurd
not
in
the
least
the
absurd
thing
is
your
fancying
that
you
care
about
this
follow
ashforth
no
you
must
really
stop
you
must
indeed
i
do
i
know
the
sort
of
fellow
he
is
a
dull
dry
chap
who
makes
love
as
if
he
was
dancing
a
minuet
you
quite
wrong
and
kisses
you
as
if
it
was
part
of
the
church
service
this
last
description
applied
to
john
ashforth
manner
of
wooing
had
enough
of
aptness
to
stir
dora
into
genuine
resentment
a
girl
does
like
a
man
less
because
he
respects
her
nor
more
because
he
ridicules
better
men
than
himself
do
be
angry
i
only
saying
what
true
why
should
i
want
to
run
him
down
i
suppose
well
i
suppose
because
well
you
a
little
bit
but
i
do
think
i
ought
to
talk
about
it
jealous
you
were
going
to
say
was
i
and
that
shows
you
know
what
i
mean
well
by
now
i
suppose
i
do
i
ca
help
your
doing
it
or
i
would
charlie
moved
closer
and
leaning
forward
till
his
face
was
only
a
yard
from
hers
while
his
hand
sliding
along
the
back
of
the
seat
almost
touched
her
said
in
a
low
voice
are
you
sure
you
would
dora
answer
was
a
laugh
a
laugh
with
a
hint
of
nervousness
in
it
perhaps
she
knew
what
was
in
it
for
she
looked
away
towards
the
river
dolly
he
whispered
shall
i
go
back
to
cannes
shall
i
perhaps
the
audacity
of
this
per
saltum
advance
from
the
distance
of
miss
to
the
ineffable
assumption
involved
in
made
the
subject
of
it
dumb
i
will
if
you
ask
me
he
said
us
she
was
silent
for
a
space
then
with
profile
towards
him
and
eyes
away
she
murmured
what
would
miss
travers
say
if
you
turned
back
now
the
mention
of
mary
did
not
on
this
occasion
evoke
any
unseemly
words
on
the
contrary
charlie
smiled
he
glanced
at
his
companion
he
glanced
behind
him
and
round
him
then
drilling
his
deep
design
into
the
semblance
of
an
uncontrollable
impulse
he
seized
dora
hand
in
his
and
before
she
could
stir
kissed
her
cheek
she
leapt
to
her
feet
how
dare
you
she
cried
how
could
i
help
it
i
never
speak
to
you
again
no
gentleman
would
have
oh
i
do
hope
you
ashamed
of
yourself
her
words
evidently
struck
home
with
an
air
of
contrition
he
sank
on
the
seat
i
a
beast
he
said
ruefully
you
quite
right
miss
bellairs
do
have
anything
more
to
say
to
me
i
wish
i
was
i
wish
i
had
some
some
and
you
know
if
i
were
a
fellow
like
ashforth
now
i
should
never
have
done
that
of
course
you
ca
forgive
me
and
in
his
extremity
of
remorse
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
dora
stood
beside
him
she
made
one
step
as
if
to
leave
him
a
glance
at
him
brought
her
back
and
she
looked
down
at
him
for
a
minute
presently
a
troubled
doubtful
little
smile
appeared
on
her
face
when
she
realized
it
was
there
she
promptly
banished
it
alas
it
was
too
late
the
rascal
had
been
peeping
through
his
fingers
and
with
a
ringing
laugh
he
sprang
to
his
feet
caught
both
her
hands
and
cried
shocking
was
it
awful
let
me
go
mr
ellerton
must
i
yes
yes
why
why
when
you
sir
roger
coming
look
behind
you
oh
the
deuce
an
instant
later
they
were
sitting
demurely
at
opposite
ends
of
the
seat
inspecting
villeneuve
with
interest
in
another
moment
deane
stood
before
them
puffing
a
cigarette
and
wearing
an
expression
of
amiability
tempered
by
boredom
wonderful
old
place
is
it
deane
asked
charlie
such
a
view
sir
roger
cried
dora
in
almost
breathless
enthusiasm
you
certainly
assented
deane
do
see
some
wonderful
sights
on
this
promenade
i
glad
i
came
up
the
air
given
you
quite
a
color
miss
dora
it
declared
dora
suddenly
take
me
down
with
you
sir
roger
ellerton
go
and
tell
the
others
we
going
home
to
tea
charlie
started
off
and
sir
roger
strolled
along
by
miss
side
presently
he
said
still
anxious
to
get
to
paris
why
should
i
be
she
asked
quickly
i
thought
perhaps
the
charms
of
avignon
would
have
decided
you
to
linger
have
you
been
tempted
dora
glanced
at
him
but
his
face
betrayed
no
secondary
meaning
tempted
oh
perhaps
she
answered
with
the
same
nervous
little
laugh
but
not
quite
led
astray
i
going
on
chapter
viii
and
ashforth
all
that
evening
miss
bellairs
was
not
observed
and
deane
watched
her
very
closely
to
address
a
word
to
charlie
ellerton
even
was
avoided
by
a
premature
disappearance
and
unexpected
failure
to
return
perhaps
it
was
part
of
the
same
policy
of
seclusion
which
made
her
persuade
lady
deane
to
travel
to
paris
with
her
in
one
compartment
and
relegate
the
men
to
another
a
proposal
which
the
banished
accepted
by
an
enthusiastic
majority
of
two
to
one
the
general
foresaw
an
infinity
of
quiet
naps
and
deane
uninterrupted
smoking
charlie
alone
chafed
against
the
necessary
interruption
of
his
bold
campaign
but
in
face
of
dora
calm
coldness
of
aspect
he
did
not
dare
to
lift
up
his
voice
lady
deane
was
so
engrossed
in
the
study
or
the
search
for
opportunities
of
study
of
sides
of
life
with
which
she
was
unfamiliar
as
to
be
for
the
most
part
blind
to
what
took
place
immediately
around
her
general
bellairs
himself
who
vaguely
supposed
that
some
man
might
try
to
make
love
to
his
daughter
five
years
hence
and
thereupon
be
promptly
sent
off
with
a
flea
in
his
ear
was
not
more
unconscious
than
she
that
there
was
had
been
or
might
be
anything
as
the
phrase
runs
the
two
junior
members
of
the
party
lady
deane
had
no
hints
to
give
and
no
questions
to
ask
she
seated
herself
placidly
in
a
corner
and
began
to
write
in
a
large
she
had
been
unwillingly
compelled
to
marseilles
but
as
she
wrote
she
found
that
the
rough
notes
she
was
copying
aided
by
fresh
memory
supplied
her
with
an
ample
fund
of
material
alternately
she
smiled
contentedly
to
herself
and
gazed
out
of
the
window
with
a
preoccupied
air
clearly
a
plot
was
and
the
author
was
grateful
to
dora
for
restricting
her
interruptions
to
an
occasional
impatient
sigh
and
the
taking
up
and
dropping
again
of
her
tauchnitz
with
the
men
tongues
moved
more
well
general
said
deane
what
miss
dora
ultimatum
about
your
staying
in
paris
charlie
pricked
up
his
ears
and
buried
his
face
behind
la
vie
parisienne
you
think
me
very
weak
deane
rejoined
the
general
with
an
apologetic
laugh
but
i
promised
to
go
straight
on
if
she
wants
me
to
and
does
she
i
do
know
what
the
child
has
got
in
her
head
but
she
says
tell
me
when
she
gets
to
paris
we
shall
have
a
day
with
you
anyhow
i
do
think
she
so
set
on
not
staying
as
she
was
but
i
do
profess
to
understand
her
fancies
still
as
you
see
i
yield
to
them
man
task
in
the
world
said
deane
eh
charlie
what
are
you
hiding
behind
that
paper
for
i
was
only
looking
at
the
pictures
quite
enough
too
you
going
to
stay
in
paris
are
you
do
know
yet
old
fellow
it
depends
on
whether
i
get
a
letter
calling
me
back
or
not
hang
it
one
might
as
well
be
in
a
house
where
the
shooting
turns
out
a
fraud
nobody
knows
that
he
wo
have
a
wire
any
morning
and
have
to
go
back
to
town
my
wife
be
furious
if
you
desert
her
general
oh
i
hope
it
wo
come
to
that
i
hope
awfully
that
i
shall
be
able
to
stay
said
charlie
with
obvious
sincerity
then
observed
deane
with
a
slight
smile
if
the
general
and
miss
bellairs
leave
us
you
can
take
my
wife
about
i
should
think
you
might
take
her
yourself
and
he
gently
kicked
deane
he
was
afraid
of
arousing
the
general
dormant
suspicions
it
was
late
at
night
when
they
arrived
in
paris
but
the
faithful
laing
was
on
the
platform
to
meet
them
and
received
them
with
a
warm
greeting
while
the
luggage
was
being
collected
by
deane
man
they
stood
and
talked
on
the
platform
presently
the
general
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
asked
i
suppose
nothing
came
for
us
at
cannes
oh
laing
you
said
bring
anything
on
you
know
laing
interrupted
a
pretty
speech
which
he
was
trying
to
direct
into
dora
inattentive
ears
beg
pardon
general
no
letters
for
any
of
us
before
you
left
cannes
no
gen
he
began
but
suddenly
stopped
his
mouth
remained
open
and
his
glass
fell
from
his
eye
the
general
not
waiting
to
hear
more
than
the
first
word
had
rushed
of
to
hail
a
cab
and
deane
was
escorting
his
wife
dora
and
charlie
stood
waiting
for
the
unfinished
speech
the
end
came
slowly
and
with
a
prodigious
emphasis
of
despair
oh
by
jove
well
mr
laing
said
dora
the
morning
you
left
just
after
there
were
two
telegrams
for
me
said
each
of
his
auditors
one
for
each
of
you
but
oh
give
me
mine
hand
over
mine
old
chap
i
i
have
got
what
i
i
awfully
sorry
i
forgot
oh
how
tiresome
of
you
mr
laing
send
round
first
thing
laing
but
but
i
do
know
where
i
put
i
know
i
laid
down
then
i
took
up
then
i
put
where
the
deuce
did
i
put
here
a
go
miss
bellairs
i
say
i
am
an
ass
no
contradiction
assailed
him
his
victims
glared
reproachfully
at
him
i
must
have
left
them
at
cannes
i
wire
first
thing
in
the
morning
miss
bellairs
i
get
up

soon
as

open
i
say

me
well
laing
i
try
but
laing
here
my
wife
wants
you
shouted
sir
roger
and
the
criminal
happy
to
escape
ran
away
leaving
dora
and
charlie
alone
they
must
have
been
from
murmured
dora
no
doubt
and
that
fool
laing
what
has
he
done
with
them
lit
his
pipe
with
them
i
expect
oh
what
shall
we
do
i
do
know
what
what
do
you
think
they
said
mr
ellerton
how
can
i
tell
perhaps
that
the
marriage
was
off
oh
escaped
from
dora
perhaps
that
it
was
going
on
it
worse
than
ever
they
may
have
asked
for
answers
probably
and
they
wo
have
written
here
sure
not
to
have
and
and
i
sha
know
what
to
do
i
i
believe
it
was
to
say
he
had
broken
off
the
marriage
is
the
wish
father
to
the
thought
the
lights
of
the
station
flickered
but
charlie
saw
or
thought
he
saw
a
hasty
unpremeditated
gesture
of
protest
dolly
he
whispered
hush
hush
how
can
you
now
before
we
know
the
cab
waiting
called
deane
come
along
they
got
in
in
silence
the
general
and
the
deanes
went
first
and
the
three
young
people
followed
in
a
second
vehicle
it
was
but
just
twelve
and
the
boulevards
were
gay
and
full
of
people
suddenly
as
they
were
near
the
opera
they
saw
the
tall
figure
of
an
unmistakable
englishman
walking
away
from
them
down
the
avenue
de
dora
clutched
charlie
arm
with
a
convulsive
grip
hullo
what
the
he
began
but
a
second
pinch
enforced
silence
see
that
chap
asked
laing
pointing
to
the
figure
he
at
my
hotel
is
he
said
dora
in
a
faint
voice
yes
i
got
a
good
deal
of
amusement
out
of
him
he
ought
to
be
out
so
late
though
and
by
himself
too
who
is
it
asked
charlie
i
do
know
his
name
and
why
ought
he
to
be
out
because
he
on
his
honeymoon
what
cried
dora
just
married
explained
laing
wife
a
tallish
girl
fair
rather
looks
standoffish
though
you
you
sure
they
married
mr
laing
gasped
dora
and
charlie
in
whom
her
manner
had
awakened
a
suspicion
of
the
truth
also
waited
eagerly
for
the
reply
what
miss
bellairs
asked
laing
in
surprise
oh
i
mean
i
mean
you
have
made
a
mistake
well
they
together
all
day
and
nobody
with
them
except
a
i
should
think
that
good
enough
with
a
sigh
dora
sank
back
against
the
cushions
they
were
at
the
hotel
now
the
others
had
already
entered
and
bidding
laing
a
hearty
dora
ran
in
followed
closely
by
charlie
he
did
not
overtake
her
before
she
found
her
father
well
dolly
said
the
general
there
no
letter
oh
cried
dolly
i
stay
as
long
as
ever
you
like
papa
that
right
said
deane
and
you
charlie
charlie
took
his
cue
a
month
if
you
like
capital
now
for
a
wash
come
along
maud
and
then
supper
dora
lingered
behind
the
others
and
charlie
with
her
directly
they
were
alone
he
asked
what
does
it
all
mean
she
sat
down
still
panting
with
agitation
why
why
that
man
we
saw
the
man
laing
says
is
on
his
honeymoon
is
is
yes
yes
mr
ashforth
dolly
and
his
wife
by
jove
it
an
exact
description
of
mary
travers
the
telegrams
were
to
say
the
marriage
was
to
be
at
once
yes
and
they
married
yes
a
short
pause
marked
the
astounding
conclusion
then
charlie
came
up
very
close
and
whispered
are
you
dolly
she
turned
her
face
away
with
a
blush
are
you
dolly
i
very
much
ashamed
of
myself
she
murmured
oh
ellerton
not
just
yet
and
in
deference
to
her
entreaty
charlie
had
the
grace
to
postpone
what
he
was
about
to
do
when
the
supper
was
ready
sir
roger
deane
looked
round
the
table
inquiringly
well
said
he
what
is
it
to
be
champagne
champagne
in
magnums
cried
charlie
ellerton
with
a
ringing
laugh
chapter
ix
and
ashforth
miss
bussey
was
much
relieved
when
the
doctor
pronounced
her
convalescent
and
allowed
her
to
come
downstairs
to
fall
ill
on
an
outing
is
always
exasperating
but
beyond
that
she
felt
that
her
enforced
seclusion
was
particularly
unfortunate
at
the
moment
here
were
two
young
people
not
engaged
nor
going
to
be
engaged
to
one
another
and
for
three
days
or
more
circumstances
had
abandoned
them
to
an
inevitable
and
unchaperoned
mary
made
light
of
it
she
relied
on
the
fraternal
relationship
but
that
was
after
all
a
fiction
quite
incapable
in
miss
bussey
opinion
of
supporting
the
strain
to
which
it
had
been
subjected
besides
mary
sincerity
appeared
doubtful
the
kind
girl
anxious
to
spare
her
aunt
worry
made
light
of
the
difficulties
of
her
position
but
miss
bussey
detected
a
restlessness
in
her
manner
which
clearly
betrayed
uneasiness
here
of
course
miss
bussey
was
wrong
neither
mary
nor
john
were
the
least
they
felt
no
embarrassment
but
poor
creatures
wore
out
their
spirits
in
a
useless
vigil
over
the
miss
bussey
was
restored
to
active
life
on
the
morning
after
the
party
from
cannes
arrived
in
paris
and
she
hastened
to
emphasize
the
fact
of
her
return
to
complete
health
by
the
unusual
effort
of
coming
down
to
breakfast
she
was
in
high
feather
and
her
cheery
conversation
lifted
to
some
extent
the
gloom
which
had
settled
on
her
young
friends
while
exhorting
to
patience
she
was
full
of
hope
and
dismissed
as
chimerical
all
the
darker
explanations
which
the
disconsolate
lovers
invented
to
account
for
the
silence
their
communications
had
met
with
under
her
influence
the
became
positively
cheerful
and
at
last
all
the
three
burst
into
a
hearty
laugh
at
one
of
the
old
lady
little
jokes
at
this
moment
arthur
laing
entered
the
room
his
brow
was
clouded
he
had
searched
his
purse
his
the
lining
of
his
hat
in
fact
every
depository
where
a
careful
man
would
be
likely
to
bestow
documents
whose
existence
he
wished
to
remember
as
no
careful
man
would
put
such
things
in
the
pocket
of
his
he
had
not
searched
there
thus
the
telegrams
had
not
appeared
and
the
culprit
was
looking
forward
with
some
alarm
to
the
reception
which
would
await
him
when
he
up
to
lunch
with
his
friends
as
he
had
promised
to
do
hardly
however
had
he
sat
down
to
his
coffee
when
his
sombre
thoughts
were
cleared
away
by
the
extraordinary
spectacle
of
young
and
ashforth
hobnobbing
with
their
maid
the
latter
lady
appearing
quite
at
home
and
leading
the
gayety
and
the
conversation
laing
laid
down
his
roll
and
his
knife
and
looked
at
them
in
undisguised
amazement
for
a
moment
doubt
of
his
cherished
theory
began
to
assail
his
mind
he
heard
the
old
lady
call
ashforth
john
that
was
a
little
strange
and
it
was
rather
strange
that
john
answered
by
saying
that
must
be
as
you
wish
i
am
entirely
at
your
disposal
and
yet
reflected
laing
was
it
very
strange
after
all
in
his
own
family
they
had
an
old
retainer
who
called
all
the
children
whatever
their
age
by
their
christian
names
and
was
admitted
to
a
degree
of
intimacy
hardly
distinguishable
from
that
accorded
to
a
relative
laing
weighing
the
evidence
pro
and
contra
decided
that
there
was
an
overwhelming
balance
in
favor
of
his
old
view
and
dismissed
the
matter
with
the
comment
that
if
it
ever
befell
him
to
go
on
a
he
would
ask
his
wife
to
take
a
maid
with
rather
less
claims
on
her
kindness
and
his
toleration
that
same
morning
the
second
pair
of
telegrams
forwarded
by
post
from
cannes
duly
arrived
dora
and
charlie
reading
them
in
the
light
of
their
recent
happy
information
found
them
most
kind
and
comforting
although
in
reality
they
apart
from
their
missing
forerunners
told
the
recipients
nothing
at
all
john
ran
am
in
paris
at
european
please
write
anxious
to
hear
everything
decided
for
the
john
mary
to
charlie
was
even
briefer
it
said
am
here
at
european
why
no
answer
to
last
it
really
very
kind
of
ashforth
said
dora
to
charlie
as
they
strolled
in
the
garden
of
the
tuileries
to
make
such
a
point
of
what
i
think
i
expect
the
wire
that
stupid
laing
lost
was
just
to
tell
me
the
date
of
the
marriage
not
a
doubt
of
it
miss
tr
ashforth
wire
to
me
makes
that
clear
they
want
to
hear
that
we
not
desperately
unhappy
well
we
are
are
we
dolly
well
perhaps
not
is
it
extraordinary
how
we
mistook
our
feelings
of
course
though
it
natural
in
you
you
had
never
been
through
anything
of
the
sort
before
how
could
you
tell
whether
it
was
the
real
thing
or
not
dora
shot
a
glance
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
at
her
lover
but
did
not
disclaim
the
innocence
he
imputed
to
her
she
knew
men
liked
to
think
that
and
why
should
they
poor
things
she
seized
on
his
implied
admission
and
carried
the
war
into
his
country
but
you
you
who
are
so
experienced
how
did
you
come
to
make
such
a
mistake
charlie
was
not
at
a
loss
it
was
a
mistake
he
said
i
was
quite
right
then
mary
travers
was
about
the
nicest
girl
i
had
ever
seen
i
thought
her
as
charming
as
a
girl
could
be
oh
you
did
then
why
my
eyes
have
been
opened
since
then
what
did
that
why
do
you
ever
pronounce
my
name
never
mind
your
name
what
opened
your
eyes
why
yours
of
course
what
nonsense
they
very
nice
about
it
are
they
do
you
think

ought
to

it
awkward

little
sha

to
mrs
ashforth
i
suppose

i
hope

it
a
quarter
past
twelve
we
must
be
getting
back
laing
coming
to
lunch
where
arc
the
deanes

he
said

dolly
not
very
it
seems
only
an
hour
since
breakfast
how
charming
of
you
we
been
walking
here
since
ten
ellerton
will
you
be
serious
for
a
minute
i
want
to
say
something
important
when
we
meet
the
ashforths
there
must
be
a
word
said
about
about
you
know
why
not
oh
i
could
so
soon
surely
you
see
that
why
it
would
be
hardly
civil
to
them
would
it
apart
from
anything
else
well
it
might
look
rather
casual
and
i
positively
could
face
john
ashforth
you
promise
do
you
it
a
nuisance
because
you
see
dolly
you
not
to
get
into
the
habit
of
saying
at
least
not
yet
presently
if
you
good
now
promise
all
right
we
not
engaged
all
right
nor
thinking
of
it
rather
not
that
very
nice
of
you
and
when
the
ashforths
are
gone
i
shall
be
duly
rewarded
oh
we
see
do
come
along
papa
hates
being
kept
waiting
for
his
meals
and
they
must
have
finished
their
slums
long
ago
they
found
lady
deane
and
the
general
waiting
for
them
and
the
latter
proposed
an
adjournment
to
a
famous
restaurant
near
the
opera
thither
they
repaired
and
ordered
their
lunch
deane
and
laing
will
find
out
where
we
gone
and
follow
said
the
general
we
wo
wait
and
he
resumed
his
conversation
with
lady
deane
on
the
events
of
the
morning
a
moment
later
the
absentees
came
in
sir
roger
in
his
usual
leisurely
fashion
laing
hurriedly
the
latter
held
in
his
hand
two
telegrams
or
the
crumpled
d√©bris
thereof
he
rushed
up
to
the
table
and
panted
out
found
in
the
pocket
of
my
blazer
must
have
put
there
stupid
ass
never
thought
of
it
put
it
on
for
tennis
awfully
sorry
wasting
no
time
in
reproaches
dora
and
charlie
grasped
their
recovered
property
excuse
me
they
cried
simultaneously
and
opened
the
envelopes
a
moment
later
both
leant
back
in
their
chairs
the
pictures
of
helpless
bewilderment
dora
had
read
marriage
broken
off
coming
to
you
write

european
paris
charlie
had
read

writing
in
her
notebook
the
general
sir
roger
and
laing
were
busy
with
the
waiter
the
menu
and
the
quick
as
thought
the
lovers
exchanged
telegrams
they
read
and
looked
at
one
another
what
does
it
mean
whispered
dora
you
never
saw
anything
like
the
lives
those
ragpickers
lead
dora
observed
lady
deane
looking
up
from
her
task
i
was
talking
to
one
this
morning
and
he
said
maitre

in
sir

a
notion
murmured
charlie

with
this
thirst
on
me
there
are
ample
materials
for
a
revolution
more
astonishing
and
sanguinary
nonsense
general
yon
must
have
something
to
drink
can
they
have
changed
their
minds
again
dolly
they
must
have
if

i
should
think
i

you
be
if

playing
tennis
laing
cut
across
the
currents
of
conversation
hope
no
harm

miss
bellairs
about
that
wire
i
i
i
do
think

or
yours
charlie
charlie
took
a
hopeful
view
upon
my
honor
laing
i
glad
you
hid
it
oh
i
see
cried
laing
tip
for
the
wrong
eh
and
too
late
to
put
it
on
now
you
not
far
off
answered
charlie
ellerton
roger
is
it
that
the
general
is
going
to
take
me
to
the
hush
not
before
miss
bellairs
my
dear
consider
her
filial
feelings
you
and
the
general
must
make
a
quiet
bolt
of
it
we
only
going
to
the
the
arrival
of
fish
brought
a
momentary
pause
but
the
first
mouthful
was
hardly
swallowed
when
arthur
laing
started
hunted
hastily
for
his
eyeglass
and
stuck
it
in
his
eye
yes
it
is
them
said
he
see
charlie
that
table
over
there
they
got
their
backs
to
us
but
lean
see
in
the
mirror
see
who
asked
charlie
in
an
irritable
tone
why
those
honeymooners
i
say
lady
deane
it
a
queer
thing
to
have
a
to
breakf
why
by
jove
she
with
them
now
look
his
excited
interest
aroused
the
attention
of
the
whole
party
and
they
looked
across
the
long
room
ashforth
their
name
concluded
laing
i
heard
the
abigail
call
him
ashforth
and
the
lady
is
he
was
interrupted
by
the
clatter
of
a
knife
and
fork
falling
on
a
plate
he
turned
in
the
direction
whence
the
sound
came
dora
bellairs
leant
back
in
her
chair
her
hands
in
her
lap
charlie
ellerton
had
hidden
himself
behind
the
lady
deane
her
husband
and
the
general
gazed
inquiringly
at
dora
at
the
same
instant
there
came
a
shrill
little
cry
from
the
other
end
of
the
room
the
mirror
had
served
mary
travers
as
well
as
it
had
laing
for
a
moment
she
spoke
hastily
to
her
companion
then
she
and
john
rose
and
with
radiant
smiles
on
their
faces
advanced
toward
their
friends
the
meeting
had
come
at
last
dora
sat
still
in
consternation
charlie
peeping
out
from
behind
his
menu
saw
the
approach
now
in
heaven
name
he
groaned
are
they
married
or
are
they
and
having
said
this
he
awaited
the
worst
chapter
x
and
not
ashforth
suum
cuique
to
the
man
belongeth
courage
in
great
things
but
in
affairs
of
small
moment
woman
is
charlie
ellerton
was
speechless
dora
bellairs
by
a
supreme
effort
rose
on
shaking
legs
and
advanced
with
outstretched
hands
to
meet
john
ashforth
ashforth
i
declare
who
would
have
thought
of
meeting
you
here
she
exclaimed
and
she
added
in
an
almost
imperceptible
mysterious
whisper
hush
john
at
once
understood
that
he
was
to
make
no
reference
to
the
communications
which
had
resulted
in
this
happy
meeting
he
expressed
a
friendly
gratification
in
appropriate
words
dora
began
to
breathe
again
everything
was
passing
off
well
suddenly
she
glanced
from
john
to
mary
mary
stood
alone
about
three
yards
from
the
table
gazing
at
charlie
charlie
sat
as
though
paralyzed
he
would
ruin
everything
ellerton
she
called
sharply
charlie
started
up
but
before
he
could
reach
dora
side
the
latter
had
turned
to
mary
and
was
holding
out
a
friendly
hand
mary
responded
with
alacrity
miss
bellairs
is
it
we
ought
to
know
one
another
i
so
glad
to
meet
you
charlie
was
by
them
now
and
how
do
you
do
mr
ellerton
went
on
mary
rivalling
dora
in
composure
and
she
also
added
a
barely
visible
and
quite
inaudible
hush
who
are
they
asked
deane
in
a
low
voice
their
name
ashforth
answered
laing
god
bless
my
soul
exclaimed
the
general
i
remember
him
now
we
made
his
acquaintance
at
interlaken
but
his
name
had
slipped
from
my
memory
and
that
his
wife
fine
girl
too
i
must
speak
to
him
and
full
of
kindly
intent
he
bustled
off
and
shook
john
warmly
by
the
hand
my
dear
ashforth
delighted
to
meet
you
again
and
under
such
delightful
conditions
too
ah
well
it
only
comes
once
in
a
lifetime
does
it
in
your
case
anyhow
i
hope
i
see
dora
has
introduced
herself
you
must
present
me
when
was
it
portions
of
this
address
puzzled
john
considerably
but
he
thought
it
best
to
do
as
he
was
told
mary
he
said
let
me
introduce
general
bellairs
miss
father
to
you
general
bell
the
general
interrupted
him
by
addressing
mary
with
much
effusion
delighted
to
meet
you
ah
you
know
our
young
friend
ellerton
everybody
does
it
seems
to
me
come
you
must
join
us
waiter
two
more
places
lady
deane
let
me
introduce
ashforth
they
on
their
he
paused
an
inarticulate
sound
had
proceeded
from
mary
lips
beg
pardon
said
the
general
a
pin
might
have
been
heard
to
drop
while
mary
recovering
herself
said
coldly
i
think
there
some
mistake
i
not
mrs
ashforth
gad
it
the
old
burst
in
a
stage
whisper
from
arthur
laing
who
seemed
determined
that
john
ashforth
should
have
a
wife
the
general
looked
to
his
daughter
for
an
explanation
dora
dared
not
show
the
emotion
pictured
on
her
face
and
her
back
was
towards
the
party
charlie
ellerton
was
staring
with
a
vacant
look
at
the
lady
who
was
not
ashforth
the
worst
had
happened
john
came
to
the
rescue
with
an
awkward
laugh
he
said
oh
you
you
attribute
too
much
happiness
to
me
this
is
miss
travers
i
i
her
aunt
miss
bussey
and
she
have
kindly
allowed
me
to
join
their
travelling
party
miss
bussey
is
at
that
table
and
he
pointed
to
the
old
perhaps
it
was
as
well
that
at
this
moment
the
feelings
which
the
situation
and
above
all
the
remorseful
horror
with
which
laing
was
regarding
his
fictitious
overcame
roger
deane
he
burst
into
a
laugh
after
a
moment
the
general
followed
heartily
laing
was
the
next
bettering
his
examples
in
his
poignant
mirth
sir
roger
sprang
up
come
miss
travers
he
said
sit
down
here
the
fellow
who
gave
you
your
new
name
blame
him
and
he
indicated
laing
then
he
cried
general
we
must
have
miss
bussey
too
the
combined
party
however
was
not
when
fully
constituted
by
the
addition
of
miss
bussey
a
success
two
of
its
members
ate
nothing
and
alternated
between
gloomy
silence
and
forced
gayety
who
these
were
may
well
be
guessed
mary
and
john
found
it
difficult
to
surmount
their
embarrassment
at
the
contretemps
which
had
attended
the
introduction
or
their
perplexity
over
the
cause
of
it
laing
was
on
thorns
lest
his
distributions
of
parts
and
stations
in
life
should
be
disclosed
the
only
bright
feature
was
the
congenial
feeling
which
appeared
at
once
to
unite
miss
bussey
and
sir
roger
deane
they
sat
together
and
aided
by
the
general
geniality
and
lady
deane
supramundane
calm
carried
the
meal
to
a
conclusion
without
an
actual
breakdown
ending
up
with
a
friendly
wrangle
over
the
responsibility
for
the
bill
finally
it
was
on
sir
roger
proposal
that
they
all
agreed
to
meet
at
five
and
take
coffee
or
what
they
would
together
at
a
caf√©
by
the
water
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
with
this
understanding
the
party
broke
up
dora
and
charlie
lagging
behind
found
themselves
alone
they
hardly
dared
to
look
at
one
another
lest
their
composure
should
fail
they
not
married
said
charlie
no
they
broken
it
off
yes
because
of
us
yes
while
we
yes
well
in
all
my
life
i
never
oh
do
be
quiet
what
an
infernal
ass
that
fellow
laing
do
you
think
they
saw
anything
no
i
half
wish
they
had
oh
ellerton
what
shall
we
do
they
still
in
love
with
us
rather
they
been
waiting
for
us
dora
entered
the
hotel
gates
and
sank
into
a
chair
in
the
well
she
asked
helplessly
but
charlie
had
no
suggestion
to
offer
how
could
they
she
broke
out
indignantly
how
could
they
break
off
their
marriage
at
the
last
moment
like
that
they
they
were
as
good
as
married
it
really
hardly
people
should
know
their
own
minds
she
caught
sight
of
a
rueful
smile
on
charlie
face
oh
i
know
but
it
different
she
added
impatiently
one
expects
it
of
you
but
i
did
expect
it
of
john
ashforth
and
of
yourself
he
asked
softly
it
all
your
fault
you
wicked
boy
she
answered
charlie
sighed
heavily
we
must
break
it
to
them
said
he
mary
will
understand
she
has
such
delicacy
of
feeling
that
you
always
praising
that
girl
i
believe
you
in
love
with
her
still
well
you
as
good
as
told
me
i
was
fit
to
black
ashforth
boots
anyhow
he
would
have
have
have
tried
to
make
a
girl
care
for
him
when
he
knew
she
cared
for
somebody
else
hang
it
it
seems
to
me
ashforth
is
exactly
immaculate
why
in
switzerland
never
mind
switzerland
ellerton
please
a
silence
ensued
then
charlie
remarked
with
a
reproachful
glance
at
dora
averted
face
and
this
is
the
sequel
to
avignon
i
have
thought
a
girl
could
change
so
in
hours
dora
said
nothing
she
held
her
head
very
high
in
the
air
and
looked
straight
in
front
of
her
when
you
gave
me
that
kiss
resumed
charlie
now
this
form
of
expression
was
undoubtedly
ambiguous
to
give
a
kiss
may
mean
what
it
literally
says
to
bestow
a
kiss
to
offer
one
self
to
be
kissed
to
accept
willingly
a
proffered
kiss
and
without
much
straining
of
words
merely
to
refrain
from
angry
expostulation
and
a
rupture
of
acquaintance
when
one
is
kissed
this
last
partaking
rather
of
the
nature
of
the
ratification
of
an
unauthorized
act
and
being
in
fact
the
measure
of
criminality
but
the
other
shades
of
meaning
caught
her
attention
you
know
it
untrue
i
never
did
she
cried
angrily
i
told
you
at
the
time
that
no
gentleman
would
have
done
it
oh
you
mean
ashforth
i
suppose
it
always
ashforth
well
he
would
and
some
girls
i
know
would
forgive
a
man
on
monday
and
round
on
him
on
wednesday
oh
you
need
trouble
to
mention
names
i
know
the
paragon
thinking
of
they
were
now
at
the
hotel
going
in
asked
charlie
yes
i
suppose
we
shall
go
to
the
bois
together
i
shall
ask
papa
or
sir
roger
to
take
me
then
i
go
with
lady
deane
i
do
mind
who
you
go
with
mr
ellerton
i
take
care
that
you
annoyed
as
little
as
possible
by
my
presence
it
does
annoy
me
does
it
d
i
do
notice
it
one
way
or
the
other
oh
for
the
present
mr
ellerton
miss
bellairs
but
i
ought
to
thank
you
what
for
for
making
it
easy
to
me
to
do
what
right
and
charlie
turned
on
his
heel
and
made
rapidly
for
the
nearest
caf√©
where
he
ordered
an
absinthe
dora
went
wearily
up
to
her
bedroom
and
sitting
down
reviewed
the
recent
conversation
she
could
not
make
out
how
or
why
or
where
they
had
begun
to
quarrel
yet
they
had
certainly
not
only
begun
but
made
very
fair
progress
considering
the
time
at
their
disposal
it
had
all
been
charlie
fault
he
must
be
fond
of
that
girl
after
all
if
so
it
was
not
likely
that
she
would
let
him
see
that
she
minded
let
him
go
to
mary
travers
if
if
he
liked
that
sort
of
prim
creature
she
dora
bellairs
would
not
interfere
she
would
have
no
difficulty
in
finding
someone
who
did
care
for
her
poor
john
how
happy
he
looked
when
he
saw
her
it
was
quite
touching
he
really
looked
almost
almost
to
her
sudden
annoyance
and
alarm
she
found
herself
finishing
the
sentence
thus
almost
as
charlie
did
at
avignon
oh
he
worth
a
thousand
of
charlie
she
exclaimed
impatiently
at
four
sir
roger
deane
was
waiting
in
the
hall
presently
dora
appeared
where
are
the
others
she
asked
charlie
having
a
drink

father

maud

to
rest

so

must
come
with
me
ellerton

follow

he
always

he
i
dislike

so
sir
roger
with
a
wink
at
an
unresponsive
plaster
bust
of
le
president
followed
her
to
the
door
they
had
just
got
into
their
little
victoria
when
charlie
appeared
cigarette
in
hand
charlie
observed
deane
miss
bell
airs
thinks
you
be
more
comfortable
by
yourself
than
perched
on
this
front
seat
especially
as
you
smoking
added
dora
allez
cocher
charlie
hailed
another
vehicle
and
got
in
as
he
did
so
he
remarked
between
his
teeth
i
d
d
if
i
stand
it
chapter
xi
a
dynamite
outrage
on
one
side
of
the
lake
dora
mid
john
walked
together
on
the
other
mary
and
charlie
miss
bussey
and
roger
deane
sat
in
the
garden
of
the
caf√©
the
scene
round
them
was
gay
carriages
constantly
drove
up
discharging
daintily
attired
ladies
and
their
cavaliers
there
was
a
constant
stream
of
bicycles
some
of
them
steered
by
fair
riders
in
neat
the
spread
a
grateful
coolness
in
their
ambit
for
the
afternoon
was
hot
for
the
time
of
year
and
the
dust
had
an
almost
autumnal
volume
miss
bussey
had
been
talking
for
nearly
ten
minutes
on
end
and
now
she
stopped
with
an
exhausted
air
and
sipped
her
coffee
deane
lit
another
cigar
and
sat
silently
looking
on
at
the
life
that
passed
and
repassed
before
him
it
a
curious
story
he
observed
at
last
very
but
i
suppose
it
all
ended
happily
now
look
at
them
sir
roger
oh
i
see
them
their
troubles
are
over
at
last
poor
children
and
really
i
think
they
all
behaved
very
well
and
yet
yes
i
should
have
thought
mary
and
ashforth
so
suited
to
one
another
well
well
the
heart
an
unaccountable
thing
to
an
old
spinster
anyhow
you
right
miss
bussey
take
my
wife
and
me
you
would
have
thought
we
should
have
hit
it
off
would
you
first
year
i
knew
her
i
hardly
dared
to
speak
to
her
used
to
mug
up
browning
and
sir
roger
here
referred
to
an
eminent
living
writer
and
chaps
like
that
before
i
went
to
see
her
you
know
no
use
i
bored
her
to
death
at
last
i
chucked
it
up
well
and
i
went
one
day
and
talked
about
the
grand
national
for
half
an
hour
by
the
clock
well
she
asked
me
to
come
again
next
day
and
i
went
and
told
her
all
about
the
last
burlesque
and
and
so
on
you
know
and
then
i
asked
her
to
marry
me
and
she
said
not
directly
she
said
there
was
an
impassable
gulf
between
us
an
utter
want
of
sympathy
in
our
tastes
and
an
irreconcilable
difference
of
intellectual
outlook
dear
me
did
that
discourage
you
i
said
i
did
care
a
dash
she
was
the
only
girl
i
ever
cared
for
all
right
miss
bussey
do
laugh
and
i
have
any
outlook
she
liked
i
said
i
knew
i
was
an
ass
but
i
thought
i
knew
a
pretty
girl
when
i
saw
one
and
i
go
away
if
she
show
me
a
prettier
one
well
well
she
did
miss
bussey
laughed
a
little
of
course
resumed
sir
roger
i
got
money
you
know
and
all
that
and
perhaps
sir
roger
what
a
thing
to
say
of
your
wife
well
with
another
girl
but
hang
it
i
do
believe
maud
would
still
you
see
it
so
dashed
queer
that
sometimes
i
sure
she
very
fond
of
you
said
miss
bussey
rather
surprised
fit
the
nature
of
the
confidence
which
she
was
receiving
i
expect
it
all
right
resumed
deane
more
cheerfully
and
that
brings
us
back
to
where
we
started
does
it
and
we
started
in
bewilderment
you
puzzled
that
dora
bellairs
and
ashforth
should
pair
off
together
and
well
the
other
combination
would
seem
more
natural
would
it
does
it
surprise
you
a
little
i
never
surprised
at
anything
till
i
know
it
true
said
sir
roger
what
you
they
were
interrupted
by
the
return
of
their
friends
and
a
move
was
made
three
vehicles
were
necessary
to
take
them
back
for
the
twos
could
obviously
neither
be
separated
from
one
another
nor
united
with
anybody
else
and
in
procession
miss
bussey
and
deane
leading
they
filed
along
the
avenues
back
to
the
arc
de
triomphe
they
had
hardly
passed
the
open
place
when
their
progress
was
suddenly
arrested
a
crowd
spread
almost
across
the
broad
road
and
imperiously
commanded
a
halt
there
was
a
babble
of
tongues
great
excitement
and
a
thousand
eager
fingers
pointing
at
a
house
the
doorway
was
in
ruins
and
workmen
were
busy
shoring
it
up
with
beams
in
the
middle
of
the
crowd
there
was
an
open
circle
surrounded
by
gendarmes
and
kept
clear
of
people
in
the
middle
of
it
lay
a
thing
like
a
rather
tall
slim
minus
the
handle
the
crowd
standing
on
tiptoe
and
peeping
over
the
shoulders
of
their
guardians
shook
their
fists
at
this
article
and
apostrophised
it
with
a
wonderful
wealth
of
passionate
invectives
what
in
the
world
the
matter
cried
miss
bussey
who
was
nervous
in
a
crowd
revolution
i
suppose
responded
deane
calmly
mid
turning
to
his
nearest
neighbor
he
continued
in
the
first
french
that
came
to
him
une
autre
r√©volution
monsieur
the
man
stared
but
a
woman
near
him
burst
into
a
voluble
explanation
from
the
folds
of
which
unlearned
english
ears
disentangled
at
the
third
reiteration
the
ominous
word
dynamite
and
she
pointed
to
the
oh
it
go
off
shrieked
miss
bussey
it
gone
off
said
sir
roger
we
too
late
and
there
was
a
touch
of
disappointment
in
his
voice
as
he
turned
and
shouted
to
the
others
keep
your
seats
it
all
over
only
an
explosion
only
shuddered
miss
bussey
it
a
mercy
we
were
killed
it
appeared
that
this
mercy
had
not
stopped
at
miss
bussey
and
her
friends
nobody
had
been
killed
not
even
the
magistrate
on
the
third
floor
for
whose
discipline
and
reformation
the
occurrence
had
been
arranged
and
presently
the
carriages
were
allowed
to
proceed
lady
deane
grief
at
having
missed
so
interesting
an
occasion
was
very
poignant
no
roger
said
she
it
is
not
a
mere
craving
for
horrors
or
a
morbid
love
of
excitement
i
wish
i
had
been
there
to
observe
the
crowd
because
it
just
at
such
moments
that
people
reveal
their
true
selves
the
veil
is
lifted
the
veil
of
hypocrisy
and
convention
and
you
see
the
naked
soul
you
could
hear
it
too
maud
observed
sir
roger
fine
chance
of
improving
your
french
vocabulary
still
i
daresay
you
right
i
sure
i
am
deane
looked
at
his
wife
meditatively
you
think
he
asked
that
being
in
danger
might
make
people
reveal
their
inmost
natures
and
feelings
i
sure
of
it
gad
then
we
might
try
what
do
you
mean
roger
nothing
you
going
out
with
the
general
very
well
i
shall
take
a
turn
on
my
own
hook
as
he
strolled
toward
the
he
met
charlie
ellerton
well
old
fellow
had
a
pleasant
afternoon
glorious
answered
charlie
in
a
husky
voice
are
we
to
congratulate
you
i
i
well
it
not
settled
yet
deane
but
soon
i
hope
that
right
miss
bussey
told
me
the
whole
story
and
i
think
precious
lucky
to
get
such
a
girl
yes
are
i
you
do
look
over
and
above
radiant
do
you
want
me
to
go
grinning
about
the
hotel
like
an
infernal
hyena
i
think
a
chastened
joy
would
be
appropriate
do
be
an
ass
deane
i
suppose
you
think
you
funny
sir
roger
passed
on
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
as
he
passed
the
dora
bellairs
came
out
well
miss
dora
enjoyed
your
afternoon
oh
awfully
except
that
dreadful
explosion
you
must
excuse
a
friend
you
know
i
awfully
glad
it
all
come
right
in
the
end
you
you
very
kind
sir
roger
it
it
there
nothing
quite
settled
yet
oh
of
course
not
but
still
well
i
heard
all
about
it
and
i
think
he
worthy
of
you
i
ca
say
more
he
seems
a
capital
fellow
yes
is
he
i
yes
oh
i
very
very
happy
and
after
making
this
declaration
in
a
shaky
voice
she
fairly
ran
away
down
the
passage
deane
watched
her
as
she
went
maud
right
said
he
she
always
is
there
nothing
for
it
but
dynamite
i
wonder
where
it
to
be
got
general
bellairs
clapped
him
on
the
shoulders
inclined
for
a
turn
deane
i
going
to
see
an
old
servant
of
mine
painter
his
name
he
married
my
poor
wife
french
maid
and
set
up
as
a
in
the
i
always
look
him
up
when
i
come
to
paris
i
your
man
answered
deane
and
they
set
out
for
establishment
it
proved
to
be
a
neat
little
place
neither
of
the
very
cheap
nor
of
the
very
sumptuous
class
and
the
general
was
soon
promising
to
bring
the
whole
party
to
dejeuner
there
painter
was
profuse
in
thanks
and
called
madame
to
thank
the
general
the
general
at
once
entered
into
conversation
with
the
trim
little
woman
nice
place

painter
observed
deane
pleased
to
hear
you
say
so
sir
roger

nice
ah
er

of
the
explosion
yes
sir
roger
abominable
thing
sir
these
socialists
quite
so
never
had
one
here
i
suppose
no
sir
we
pretty
well
looked
after
in
here
like
one
asked
deane

pardon
sir
no
sir
because
i
want
one
you
beg
pardon
sir

i
drop
in
here
after

for
some
coffee
i
want
to
talk
to
you

not

to
the
general
glad
to
see
you

roger
but

put
you
up
to
it
here

to
madame
they
went
away
haying

with
the
painters
for
luncheon
and
a
private
room
on
the
next
day
but
one
lunch
for
eight
said
deane
at
least
general
i
thought
we
might
ask
our
friends
from
the
european
yes
and
young
laing
oh
i
forgot
him
yes
laing
of
course
for
nine
neuf
you
know
please
madame
that
all
right
said
the
general
i
glad
to
do
him
a
turn
yes
that
all
right
assented
sir
roger
with
the
slightest
possible
chuckle
we
shall
have
a
jolly
lunch
eh
general
chapter
xii
another
i
shall
never
never
forgot
your
generosity
john
no
mary
it
was
your
honesty
and
courage
that
did
it
i
told
ellerton
the
whole
story
and
he
seemed
positively
astonished
and
miss
bellairs
admitted
that
when
she
wrote
she
considered
such
a
tiling
utterly
impossible
she
changed
a
little
mary
she
not
so
cheerful
and
as
she
used
to
be
think
what
she
gone
through
i
noticed
just
the
same
in
ellerton
but
you
hope
to
restore
him
soon
oh
well
i
expect
miss
bellairs
what
a
pretty
girl
she
is
john
will
soon
revive
too
now
she
is
with
you
again
john
have
you
observed
anything
peculiar
in
aunt
sarah
manner
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
fancied
she
was
rather
short
with
me
once
or
twice
at
dinner
i
believe
she
is
is
pleased
at
at
what
happened
she
taken
much
to
ellerton
and
you
know
she
liked
you
so
much
that
i
think
she
still
wants
you
as
one
of
the
family
john
laughed
then
he
leant
forward
and
said
in
a
low
voice
have
you
settled
anything
about
dates
no
ellerton
well
he
did
introduce
the
subject
so
of
course
i
did
have
you
no
we
have
i
made
some
suggestion
of
the
kind
but
miss
bellairs
did
fall
in
with
it
she
wo
even
let
me
ask
her
father
consent
just
yet
ellerton
proposes
not
to
announce
our
anything
for
a
few
days
well
said
john
i
shall
insist
on
an
announcement
very
shortly
and
you
ought
to
do
the
same
mary
we
know
the
evils
he
checked
himself
but
mary
was
not
embarrassed
of
secret
engagements
she
said
calmly
we
do
indeed
besides
it
a
bore
i
could
go
with
miss
bellairs
to
the
theatre
because
she
said
it
would
look
too
marked
yes
and
ellerton
said
that
if
he
dined
here
he
might
as
well
announce
our
engagement
from
the
statue
of
strasburg
john
frowned
and
mary
perceiving
the
bent
of
his
thoughts
ventured
to
say
though
with
a
timid
air
unusual
to
her
i
think
they
the
least
little
bit
inconsiderate
do
you
john
after
all
we
have
done
for
them
well
i
do
mind
admitting
that
i
do
feel
that
i
do
not
consider
that
miss
bellairs
quite
appreciates
the
effort
i
have
made
mary
sighed
we
must
expect
too
much
of
them
must
we
she
asked
i
suppose
not
john
conceded
but
he
still
frowned
when
we
consider
how
simple
the
elements
of
perfect
happiness
appear
to
be
regarded
in
the
abstract
it
becomes
surprising
to
think
how
difficult
it
is
to
attain
them
in
the
concrete
a
kind
magician
may
grant
us
all
we
ask
may
transport
us
whither
we
would
go
dower
us
with
all
we
lack
bring
to
us
one
desired
companion
after
another
but
something
is
wrong
we
have
a
toothache
or
in
spite
of
our
rich
curtains
there
a
draught
or
the
loved
one
haps
not
to
be
at
the
moment
congenial
and
we
pitifully
pray
the
wizard
to
wave
his
wand
again
would
any
magician
wave
his
for
these
four
troublesome
folk
it
must
be
admitted
that
they
hardly
deserved
it
nevertheless
a
magician
was
at
work
and
with
the
expiration
of
the
next
night
his
train
was
laid
at
eleven
in
the
forenoon
of
friday
roger
deane
had
a
final
interview
with
the
still
hesitating
painter
but
if
the
police
should
come
sir
roger
urged
the
fearful
man
why
you
look
a
fool
that
all
is
the
figure
high
enough
most
liberal
sir
roger
but
but
it
will
alarm
my
wife
if
you
come
to
that
it
alarm
my
wife
very
true
sir
roger
painter
seemed
to
derive
some
comfort
from
this
indirect
community
of
feeling
with
the
aristocracy
it
alarm
everybody
i
hope
that
what
it
for
now
mind
sharp
and
when
the
coffee
been
in
ten
minutes
not
before
i
must
have
time
for
coffee
very
good
sir
roger
is
the
ladder
ready
yes
sir
roger
and
the
quite
ready
sir
roger
let
see
it
it
was
inspected
and
pronounced
satisfactory
then
roger
deane
set
out
to
return
to
his
hotel
murmuring
contentedly
if
that
do
make
up
their
minds
for
i
do
know
what
will
then
he
paused
suddenly
gad
will
the
women
have
hysterics
he
asked
but
in
a
moment
he
added
reassuring
himself
maud
never
has
and
hang
it
we
must
chance
the
rest
arrived
at
home
he
found
arthur
laing
kicking
his
heels
in
the
lunching
with
you
ai
i
somewhere
in
the
asked
the
visitor
yes
some
place
the
general
found
out
look
here
laing
are
you
a
nervous
man
nervous
what
do
you
take
me
for
lose
your
head
in
moments
of
excitement
i
never

more
infernal
nonsense
it
sounds
the
more
you

your
oath
about
it
i
there
and
finally

on
no
account
to
lay
a
finger

on
miss
travers
or
on
dora
bellairs
hullo

the
habit
of
beating

any
time

i

harm

as

row

and
i
say
the
ladies

miss
bussey
see
oh
i
see
seems
to
me
we
going
to
have
a
lively
lunch
am
i
to
carry
the
old
lady
yes
oh
by
jove
how
my
biceps
just
feel
will
you
deane
felt
and
gravely
pronounced
the
muscle
to
be
equal
to
its
task
laing
was
much
gratified
and
awaited
the
unknown
future
with
philosophic
patience
sir
roger
had
predicted
a
jolly
lunch
but
in
its
early
stages
the
entertainment
hardly
earned
this
description
something
was
wrong
somewhere
dora
started
by
refusing
very
pointedly
to
sit
near
charlie
ellerton
and
yet
when
she
found
herself
between
ashforth
and
laing
she
was
absent
silent
and
melancholy
charlie
on
the
other
hand
painfully
practised
a
labored
attentiveness
to
mary
travers
which
contrasted
ill
with
his
usual
spontaneous
and
gay
courtesy
miss
bussey
wore
an
air
of
puzzled
gravity
and
laing
kept
looking
at
her
with
a
calculating
eye
he
seemed
to
be
seeking
the
best
grip
lady
deane
and
the
general
engrossed
in
a
discussion
did
little
to
promote
the
hilarity
of
the
table
and
it
was
left
to
deane
to
maintain
the
flow
of
conversation
as
he
best
could
apparently
he
found
the
task
a
heavy
one
for
before
long
he
took
a
newspaper
out
of
his
pocket
and
√†
propos
to
one
of
his
own
remarks
began
to
read
a
highly
decorated
account
of
the
fearful
injuries
under
which
the
last
victim
of
the
last
diabolical
explosion
had
been
in
danger
of
succumbing
sir
roger
read
his
gruesome
narrative
with
much
emphasis
and
as
he
laid
down
the
paper
he
observed
well
i
hope
i
not
more
of
a
coward
than
most
men
but
in
face
of
dynamite
ugh
and
he
shuddered
realistically
i
should
make
for
the
door
said
laing
yes
but
in
this
case
the
bomb
was
at
the
door
then
said
laing
i
should
exit
by
the
window
but
this
poor
man
remarked
mary
travers
stayed
to
rescue
the
woman
he
loved
and
her
eyes
rested
for
an
instant
in
confident
affection
on
charlie
ellerton
we
should
all
do
as
much
i
trust
said
john
glancing
at
dora
bellairs
i
sure
i
hope
you
wo
have
to
said
dora
rather
ungraciously
think
what
a
convincing
test
of
affection
it
would
be
suggested
deane
persuasively
after
that
you
could
never
doubt
that
the
man
loved
you
my
good
sir
roger
observed
miss
bussey
it
would
be
common
humanity
suppose
there
were
two
girls
said
laing
and
you
could
take
both
deane
hastily
interposed
have
we
had
enough
of
this
dreary
subject
he
asked
and
he
frowned
slightly
at
laing
is
it
about
time
for
coffee
the
general
suggested
deane
looked
at
his
watch
what
does
the
time
matter
deane
if
we
ready
not
a
bit
that
all
right
and
he
rang
the
bell
painter
came
in
with
the
coffee
the
little
man
looked
rather
pale
and
nervous
but
succeeded
in
serving
the
company
without
upsetting
the
cups
he
came
to
deane
last
is
everything
ready
whispered
that
gentleman
and
receiving
a
trembling
yes
sir
he
added
in
ten
minutes
this
he
observed
out
loud
has
been
a
pleasant
gathering
a
pleasant
end
to
our
outing
what
you
going
asked
miss
bussey
yes
my
wife
and
i
cross
to
england
i
shall
go
the
next
day
announced
the
general
if
dora
is
ready
john
threw
a
glance
toward
dora
but
she
was
busy
drinking
her
coffee
well
said
deane
i
hope
we
may
soon
meet
again
under
equally
delightful
circumstances
in
london
at
any
rate
he
added
with
a
laugh
there
we
shall
be
safe
from
crash
a
loud
noise
came
from
the
door
as
if
of
some
metallic
substance
thrown
against
the
panels
hullo
said
laing
oh
somebody
tumbled
downstairs
said
deane
reassuringly
move
miss
bussey
oh
but
sir
roger
what
is
it
what
do
you
think
it
did
sound
at
all
like
what
you
say
the
general
laughed
come
miss
bussey
i
do
suppose
it
as
he
spoke
the
form
of
painter
appeared
at
the
open
window
he
was
breathless
and
shrieked
hastily
dynamite
dynamite
save
yourselves
it
be
off
in
a
minute
then
i
shall
be
off
in
half
a
minute
said
laing
there
was
a
rush
to
the
door
and
laing
remembering
his
instructions
joined
hastily
in
it
no
no
the
bomb
there
cried
painter
excitedly
they
stood
still
in
horror
for
ten
seconds
to
the
window
to
the
window
for
your
lives
save
the
ladies
cried
sir
roger
deane
chapter
xiii
faithful
to
death
the
ladies
looked
at
one
another
even
in
that
awful
moment
the
becoming
the
seemly
the
dignified
had
its
claims
the
window
was
narrow
the
ladder
mary
travers
had
gone
to
look
at
it
was
steep
a
little
curious
excited
crowd
was
gathering
below
deane
saw
their
hesitation
he
rushed
to
the
door
and
cautiously
opened
it
the
thing
was
there
across
the
very
entrance
that
villainous
oblong
case
and
from
below
came
a
shriek
it
was
madame
voice
and
a
cry
of
quick
quick
this
said
the
general
firmly
he
had
been
through
the
mutiny
is
not
a
time
for
punctilio
excuse
me
and
he
lifted
lady
deane
in
his
stalwart
arms
and
bore
her
toward
the
window
with
a
distant
reminiscence
of
the
ball
room
arthur
laing
approached
miss
bussey
murmuring
may
i
have
the
and
with
a
mighty
effort
swung
the
good
lady
from
the
ground
she
clutched
his
cravat
wildly
crying
save
me
mary
travers
was
calmness
itself
with
quiet
mien
and
unfaltering
voice
she
laid
her
hand
on
charlie
arm
and
murmured
i
am
ready
charlie
at
the
same
moment
john
ashforth
the
light
of
heroism
in
his
eye
whispered
to
dora
you
must
trust
yourself
implicitly
to
me
quick
quick
cried
deane
or
it
all
up
with
you
quick
ashforth
quick
charlie
quick
man
there
was
one
more
pause
mary
hand
pressed
a
little
harder
arm
was
advancing
towards
dora
waist
sir
roger
looked
on
with
apparent
impatience
are
you
never
going
he
called
must
i
suddenly
a
loud
cry
rang
out
it
came
from
miss
bellairs
oh
charlie
save
me
save
me
she
cried
and
then
and
there
flung
herself
into
his
arms
my
darling
he
whispered
loudly
and
catching
her
up
made
for
the
window
as
they
disappeared
through
it
deane
softly
and
swiftly
opened
the
door
and
disappeared
in
his
turn
mary
and
john
were
left
alone
then
mary
composure
gave
way
sinking
into
a
chair
she
cried
and
i
am
left
nobody
cares
for
me
what
shall
i
do
in
an
instant
john
strong
arm
was
round
her
i
care
for
you
he
cried
and
raising
her
almost
senseless
form
he
rushed
to
the
window
the
ladder
was
gone
gone
he
shrieked
where
is
it
there
was
no
answer
the
little
crowd
had
gone
too
we
are
lost
he
said
mary
opened
her
eyes
lost
she
echoed
lost
abandoned
by
those
who
loved
ah
no
no
mary
in
the
hour
of
danger
then
we
see
the
truth
mary
arms
clasped
him
closer
ah
john
john
she
said
we
must
die
together
dear
john
stooped
and
kissed
her
suddenly
the
door
was
opened
and
deane
entered
he
wore
a
comically
apologetic
look
and
carried
an
oblong
metal
vessel
in
his
right
hand
excuse
me
he
said
there
been
er
slight
but
very
natural
mistake
it
was
er
exactly
dynamite
it
er
a
tin
that
fool
painter
then
we
safe
cried
mary
yes
thank
heaven
answered
deane
fervently
oh
john
she
cried
sir
roger
with
a
smile
retired
and
closed
the
door
after
him
downstairs
lady
deane
and
miss
bussey
forgetful
of
their
sufferings
were
restoring
madame
painter
to
her
senses
painter
was
uncorking
a
bottle
of
champagne
for
arthur
laing
sir
roger
deane
was
talking
in
a
low
voice
and
persuasive
tones
to
an
imposing
representative
of
the
police
what
passed
between
them
is
unknown
possibly
only
words
possibly
something
else
at
any
rate
after
a
time
deane
smiled
the
great
man
smiled
responsively
saluted
and
disappeared
murmuring
something
about
anglais
milords
and
dr√¥les
the
precise
purport
of
his
reflections
could
not
be
distinctly
understood
by
those
in
the
house
for
civility
made
him
inarticulate
but
when
he
was
safely
outside
he
looked
at
a
piece
of
crisp
paper
in
his
hand
then
with
his
thumb
pointing
over
his
shoulder
he
gave
an
immense
shrug
and
exclaimed
mais
voil√†
un
fou
and
to
this
day
he
considers
roger
deane
the
very
type
of
a
maniac
mary
and
john
descended
as
soon
as
they
appeared
dora
jumped
up
from
her
seat
and
ran
towards
john
crying
oh
mr
ashforth
while
charlie
advancing
more
timidly
to
mary
murmured
forgive
me
but
mary
with
a
slight
bow
john
with
a
lift
of
his
hat
both
without
a
halt
or
a
word
passed
through
the
room
and
vanished
from
painter
establishment
sir
roger
had
seized
on
laing
champagne
and
was
pouring
it
out
he
stopped
now
and
looked
at
dora
a
sudden
gleam
of
intelligence
glanced
from
her
eyes
rushing
up
to
him
she
whispered
you
did
it
all
it
was
all
a
hoax
he
nodded
and
why
ask
charlie
ellerton
he
answered
oh
but
ashforth
and
mary
travers
are
so
angry
with
one
another
no
with
us
sir
roger
looked
her
mercilessly
full
in
the
face
regardless
of
her
blushes
that
he
observed
with
emphasis
is
exactly
what
you
wanted
miss
bellairs
then
he
turned
to
the
company
holding
a
full
glass
in
his
hand
ladies
and
gentlemen
said
he
some
of
us
have
had
a
narrow
escape
whether
we
shall
be
glad
of
it
or
sorry
hereafter
i
do
know
do
you
charlie
but
hero
a
health
to
but
dora
glancing
apprehensively
at
the
general
whispered
not
yet
to
dynamite
said
sir
roger
deane
postscript
it
should
be
added
that
a
fuller
more
graphic
and
more
sensational
account
of
the
outrage
in
the
than
this
pen
has
been
capable
of
inscribing
will
appear
together
with
much
other
curious
and
enlightening
matter
in
lady
deane
next
work
the
author
also
takes
occasion
in
that
work
and
there
is
little
doubt
that
the
subject
was
suggested
by
the
experiences
of
some
of
her
friends
to
discuss
the
nature
quality
and
duration
of
the
passion
of
love
she
concludes
if
it
be
permissible
thus
far
to
anticipate
the
publication
of
her
book
that
all
true
love
is
absolutely
permanent
and
indestructible
untried
by
circumstance
and
untouched
by
time
and
this
opinion
is
she
says
indorsed
by
every
woman
who
has
ever
been
in
love
thus
fortified
the
conclusion
seems
beyond
cavil
if
therefore
any
incidents
here
recorded
appear
to
conflict
with
it
we
must
imitate
the
discretion
of
plato
and
say
either
these
persons
were
not
sons
of
the
gods
that
is
true
lovers
or
they
did
not
do
such
things
unfortunately
however
lady
deane
were
accessible
too
late
to
allow
of
the
title
of
this
story
being
changed
so
it
must
stand
the
wheel
of
love
but
if
any
lady
men
are
worse
than
useless
will
save
the
author
credit
by
proving
that
wheels
do
not
go
round
he
will
be
very
much
obliged
and
will
offer
her
every
facility
the
lady
of
the
pool
chapter
i
a
firm
believer
i
see
vansittart
merceron
at
the
court
again
mamma
yes
dear
lady
merceron
told
me
he
was
coming
she
wanted
to
consult
him
about
charlie
she
always
consulting
him
about
charlie
and
it
never
makes
any
difference
bushell
looked
up
from
her
needlework
her
hands
were
full
with
needle
and
stuff
and
a
couple
of
pins
protruded
from
her
lips
she
glanced
at
her
daughter
who
stood
by
the
window
in
the
bright
blaze
of
a
brilliant
sunset
listlessly
hitting
the
and
its
tassel
to
and
fro
the
poor
boy
very
young
still
mumbled
bushell
through
her
pins
he
last
month
returned
millicent
i
know
because
there
exactly
three
years
between
him
and
me
the
sinking
rays
defined
miss
bushell
form
with
wonderful
clearness
she
was
very
tall
and
the
severe
cloth
gown
she
wore
set
off
the
stately
lines
of
her
figure
she
had
a
great
quantity
of
fair
hair
and
a
handsome
face
spoilt
somewhat
by
a
slightly
excessive
breadth
across
the
cheeks
as
her
height
demanded
or
excused
her
hands
and
feet
were
not
small
though
well
shaped
would
time
have
arrested
his
march
for
ever
there
would
have
been
small
fault
to
find
with
gifts
to
miss
bushell
but
as
her
mother
said
millie
was
just
what
she
had
been
at
and
bushell
was
now
extremely
stout
millie
escaped
the
inference
by
discrediting
her
mother
recollection
the
young
lady
wore
her
hat
and
presently
she
turned
away
from
the
window
remarking
i
think
i
shall
go
for
a
stroll
i
had
no
exercise
either
inclination
or
perhaps
that
threatening
possibility
from
which
she
strove
to
avert
her
eyes
made
millie
a
devotee
of
active
pursuits
she
hunted
she
rode
she
played
and
when
at
the
seaside
golf
when
all
failed
she
walked
resolutely
four
or
five
miles
on
the
swinging
along
at
a
healthy
pace
and
never
pausing
save
to
counsel
an
old
woman
or
rebuke
a
truant
urchin
on
such
occasions
her
manner
for
we
may
not
suppose
that
her
physique
aided
the
impression
suggested
the
benevolent
yet
stern
policeman
and
the
vicar
acknowledged
in
her
an
invaluable
assistant
by
a
strange
coincidence
she
seemed
to
suit
the
house
she
lived
in
one
of
those
large
white
square
dwelling
devoid
of
ornament
yet
possessing
every
substantial
merit
and
attaining
by
virtue
of
their
dimensions
and
simplicity
an
effect
of
handsomeness
denied
to
many
more
building
the
house
satisfied
so
did
millie
unless
the
judge
were
very
critical
i
shall
just
walk
round
by
the
pool
and
back
she
added
as
she
opened
the
door
my
dear
it
four
miles
well
it
only
a
little
after
six
and
we
do
dine
till
eight
encountering
no
further
opposition
than
a
sigh
of
admiration
three
hundred
yards
was
the
limit
of
pleasure
in
a
walk
to
her
mother
millie
bushell
started
on
her
way
dangling
a
neat
ebony
stick
in
her
hand
and
setting
her
feet
down
with
a
firm
decisive
tread
it
did
not
take
her
long
to
cover
the
two
miles
between
her
and
her
destination
leaving
the
road
she
entered
the
grounds
of
the
court
and
following
a
little
path
which
ran
steeply
down
hill
she
found
herself
by
the
willows
and
reeds
fringing
the
edge
of
the
pool
opposite
to
her
on
the
higher
bank
some
seven
or
eight
feet
above
the
water
rose
the
temple
a
small
classical
erection
used
now
when
at
all
as
a
but
built
to
commemorate
the
sad
fate
of
agatha
merceron
the
sun
had
just
sunk
and
the
pool
looked
chill
and
gloomy
the
deep
water
under
the
temple
was
black
and
still
millie
robust
mind
was
not
prone
to
superstition
yet
she
was
rather
relieved
to
think
that
with
the
sun
only
just
gone
there
was
a
clear
hour
before
agatha
merceron
would
come
out
of
the
temple
slowly
and
fearfully
descend
the
shallow
flight
of
marble
steps
and
lay
herself
down
in
the
water
to
die
that
happened
every
evening
according
to
the
legend
an
hour
after
sunset
every
evening
for
the
last
two
hundred
years
since
poor
agatha
bereft
and
betrayed
had
found
the
pool
kinder
than
the
world
and
sunk
her
sorrow
and
her
shame
and
her
beauty
there
such
shame
and
such
beauty
as
had
never
been
before
or
after
in
all
the
generations
of
the
mercerons
what
nonsense
it
all
is
said
millie
aloud
but
i
afraid
charlie
is
silly
enough
to
believe
it
as
she
spoke
her
eye
fell
on
a
canadian
canoe
which
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
she
recognized
it
as
charlie
merceron
and
knowing
that
approach
to
the
temple
from
the
other
side
was
to
be
gained
only
by
a
difficult
path
through
a
tangled
wood
and
that
the
canoe
usually
lay
under
a
little
shed
a
few
yards
from
where
she
stood
she
concluded
that
charlie
was
in
the
temple
there
was
nothing
surprising
in
that
it
was
a
favorite
haunt
of
his
she
raised
her
voice
and
called
to
him
at
first
no
answer
came
and
she
repeated
charlie
charlie
after
a
moment
of
waiting
a
head
was
thrust
out
of
a
window
in
the
side
of
the
temple
a
head
in
a
straw
hat
hullo
said
charlie
merceron
in
tones
of
startled
surprise
then
seeing
the
visitor
he
added
oh
it
you
millie
how
did
you
know
i
was
here
by
the
canoe
of
course
hang
the
canoe
muttered
charlie
and
his
head
disappeared
a
second
later
he
came
out
of
the
doorway
and
down
the
steps
standing
on
the
lowest
he
shouted
the
pool
was
about
sixty
feet
across
what
do
you
want
how
rude
you
are
shouted
miss
bushell
in
reply
charlie
got
into
the
canoe
and
began
to
paddle
across
he
had
just
reached
the
other
side
when
millie
screamed
look
look
charlie
she
cried
the
temple
what
i
i
saw
something
white
at
the
window
charlie
got
out
of
the
canoe
hastily
what
he
asked
again
walking
up
to
miss
bushell
i
declare
i
saw
something
white
at
the
window
oh
charlie
but
all
bosh
of
course
it
is
there
nothing
in
the
temple
well
i
thought
i
wonder
you
like
to
be
there
why
should
i
the
mysterious
appearance
not
being
repeated
millie
courage
returned
i
thought
you
believed
in
the
ghost
she
said
smiling
so
i
do
but
i
do
mind
it
you
never
seen
it
supposing
i
have
that
does
prove
it
not
true
but
you
often
here
at
the
time
never
answered
charlie
with
emphasis
i
always
go
away
before
the
time
then
you
better
come
now
put
the
canoe
to
bed
and
walk
with
me
charlie
merceron
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
smiled
at
his
companion
he
was
tall
also
and
just
able
to
look
down
on
her
no
he
said
i
not
going
yet
how
rude
oh
there
it
is
again
charlie
i
saw
it
i
frightened
and
her
healthy
color
paled
a
trifle
as
she
laid
a
hand
on
charlie
arm
i
tell
you
what
observed
charlie
if
you
have
fancies
of
this
kind
you
better
not
come
here
any
more
not
in
the
evening
at
all
events
you
know
people
who
think
they
going
to
see
things
always
do
see
my
heart
is
positively
beating
said
miss
bushell
i
i
do
quite
like
walking
back
alone
i
see
you
as
far
as
the
road
charlie
conceded
and
with
remarkable
promptitude
he
led
the
way
turning
his
head
over
his
shoulder
to
remark
really
if
you
so
nervous
you
ought
to
come
here
i
never
will
again
not
alone
i
mean
charlie
had
breasted
the
hill
with
such
goodwill
that
they
were
already
at
the
road
and
you
really
going
back
she
asked
oh
just
for
a
few
minutes
i
left
my
book
in
the
temple
i
was
reading
there
she
not
due
for
half
an
hour
yet
you
know
what
what
happens
if
you
see
her
oh
you
die
answered
charlie
goodnight
and
with
a
smile
and
a
nod
he
ran
down
the
hill
towards
the
pool
miss
bushell
cavalierly
deserted
made
her
way
home
at
something
more
than
her
usual
rate
of
speed
she
had
never
believed
in
that
nonsense
but
there
was
certainly
something
white
at
that
window
something
white
that
moved
under
the
circumstances
charlie
really
might
have
seen
her
home
she
thought
for
the
road
was
gloomy
and
dusk
coming
on
apace
besides
where
was
the
hardship
in
being
her
escort
doubtless
none
charlie
would
have
answered
unless
a
man
happened
to
have
other
fish
to
fry
the
pace
at
which
the
canoe
crossed
the
pool
and
brought
up
at
its
old
moorings
witnessed
that
he
had
no
leisure
to
spend
on
miss
bushell
leaping
out
he
ran
up
the
stops
into
the
temple
crying
in
a
loud
whisper
she
gone
the
temple
was
empty
and
charlie
looking
round
in
vexation
added
so
has
she
by
jingo
he
sat
down
disconsolately
on
the
low
marble
seat
that
ran
round
the
little
shrine
there
were
no
signs
of
the
book
of
which
he
had
spoken
to
millie
bushell
there
were
no
signs
of
anybody
whom
he
could
have
meant
to
address
stay
one
sign
there
was
a
long
lay
on
the
floor
charlie
picked
it
tip
with
a
sad
smile
agatha
he
said
to
himself
and
yet
as
everyone
in
the
neighborhood
knew
poor
agatha
merceron
went
nightly
to
her
phantom
death
bareheaded
and
with
golden
locks
tossed
by
the
wind
moreover
the
pin
was
of
modern
manufacture
moreover
ghosts
do
not
wear
but
there
is
no
need
to
enter
on
debatable
ground
the
pin
was
utterly
modern
now
if
uncle
van
mused
charlie
came
here
and
saw
this
he
carefully
put
the
pin
in
his
and
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
exactly
agatha
merceron
time
yet
charlie
leant
back
on
his
cold
marble
seat
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
gazed
up
at
the
ceiling
with
the
happiest
possible
smile
on
his
face
for
one
steeped
in
family
legends
worshipping
the
hapless
lady
memory
with
warm
devotion
and
reputed
a
sincere
believer
in
her
ghostly
wanderings
he
awaited
her
coming
with
marvellous
composure
in
point
of
fact
he
had
forgotten
all
about
her
and
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
her
coming
slipping
down
the
steps
and
noiselessly
into
the
water
all
unnoticed
by
him
his
eyes
were
glued
to
the
ceiling
the
smile
played
on
his
lips
his
ears
were
filled
with
sweet
echoes
and
his
thoughts
were
far
away
perhaps
the
dead
lady
came
and
passed
unseen
that
charlie
did
not
see
her
was
ridiculously
slight
evidence
whereon
to
damn
so
ancient
and
picturesque
a
legend
he
thought
the
same
himself
for
that
night
at
dinner
he
came
in
late
for
dinner
he
maintained
the
credit
of
the
story
with
fierce
conviction
against
vansittart
scepticism
chapter
ii
miss
wallace
friend
in
old
days
the
mercerons
had
been
great
folk
they
had
held
the
earldom
of
langbury
and
the
barony
of
warmley
a
failure
of
direct
descent
in
the
male
line
extinguished
the
earldom
the
lady
agatha
was
the
daughter
of
the
last
earl
and
would
have
been
baroness
warmley
had
she
lived
on
her
death
that
title
passed
to
her
cousin
and
continued
in
that
branch
till
the
early
days
of
the
present
century
then
came
another
break
the
lord
warmley
of
that
day
a
regency
dandy
had
a
son
but
not
one
who
could
inherit
his
honors
and
away
went
the
barony
to
a
yet
younger
branch
where
falling
a
few
years
later
into
female
hands
it
was
merged
in
a
viscounty
and
was
now
waiting
till
chance
again
should
restore
it
to
an
independent
existence
from
the
mercerons
of
the
court
it
was
gone
for
ever
and
the
blot
on
their
escutcheon
which
lost
it
them
was
a
sore
point
from
which
it
behooved
visitors
and
friends
to
refrain
their
tongues
the
regent
had
indeed
with
his
good
nature
offered
a
baronetcy
to
hide
the
stain
but
pride
forbade
and
the
mercerons
now
held
no
titles
save
the
modest
dignity
which
charlie
father
made
a
for
services
in
the
provinces
had
left
behind
him
to
his
widow
but
the
old
house
was
theirs
and
a
comfortable
remnant
of
the
lands
and
the
pictures
of
the
extinct
earls
and
barons
down
to
him
whose
sins
had
robbed
the
line
of
its
surviving
rank
and
left
it
in
a
position
from
an
heraldic
point
of
view
of
doubtful
respectability
lady
merceron
felt
so
acutely
on
the
subject
that
she
banished
this
last
nobleman
to
the
there
was
considering
everything
an
appropriateness
in
that
position
and
he
no
longer
vexed
her
eyes
as
she
sat
at
meat
in
the
dining
room
she
had
purposed
a
like
banishment
for
lady
agatha
but
here
charlie
had
interceded
and
the
unhappy
beauty
hung
still
behind
his
mother
chair
and
opposite
his
own
it
was
just
to
remember
that
but
for
poor
agatha
fault
and
fate
the
present
branch
might
never
have
enjoyed
the
honors
at
all
so
charlie
urged
to
lady
merceron
catching
at
any
excuse
for
keeping
lady
agatha
lady
merceron
way
of
judging
pictures
may
seem
peculiar
but
the
fact
is
that
she
lacked
what
is
called
the
sense
of
historical
perspective
she
did
not
see
why
our
ancestors
should
be
treated
so
tenderly
and
allowed
with
a
charitable
reference
to
the
change
in
manners
forgiveness
for
what
no
one
could
hope
to
win
a
pardon
vansittart
merceron
smiled
at
his
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
in
vain
to
the
went
the
wicked
lord
warmley
and
lady
agatha
was
remarkably
lucky
in
that
she
did
not
follow
him
vansittart
to
the
late
sir
victor
and
twenty
years
younger
than
he
was
a
short
man
with
a
smooth
round
white
face
and
a
way
of
speaking
so
deliberate
and
weighty
that
it
imparted
momentousness
to
nothings
and
infallibility
to
nonsense
when
he
really
had
something
sensible
to
say
and
that
was
very
fairly
often
the
effect
was
enormous
he
was
now
a
widower
well
off
by
his
marriage
and
a
member
of
parliament
naturally
lady
merceron
relied
much
on
his
advice
especially
in
what
concerned
her
son
she
was
hazy
about
the
characters
and
needs
of
young
men
not
knowing
how
they
should
be
treated
or
what
appealed
to
them
amid
her
haziness
one
fact
only
stood
out
clear
to
deal
with
a
young
man
you
wanted
a
man
of
the
world
in
this
capacity
vansittart
had
now
been
sent
for
to
the
court
the
object
of
his
visit
being
nothing
less
than
the
arrangement
and
satisfactory
settlement
of
charlie
future
vansittart
approached
the
future
through
the
present
and
the
past
yon
wasted
your
time
at
school
you
wasted
your
time
at
oxford
wasting
your
time
now
he
remarked
when
charlie
and
he
were
left
alone
after
dinner
charlie
was
looking
at
lady
agatha
picture
with
a
sigh
he
turned
to
his
uncle
that
all
very
well
he
said
tolerantly
but
what
is
there
for
me
to
do
if
you
took
more
interest
in
country
pursuits
it
might
be
different
but
you
do
hunt
you
shoot
very
seldom
and
very
badly
and
not
at
all
well
as
you
admit
you
say
you
wo
become
a
magistrate
you
show
no
interest
in
politics
or
or
social
questions
you
simply
moon
about
charlie
was
vividly
reminded
of
a
learned
judge
whom
he
had
once
heard
pronouncing
sentence
of
death
his
uncle
denunciation
seemed
to
lack
its
appropriate
conclusion
that
he
should
be
hanged
by
the
neck
till
he
was
dead
he
was
roused
to
defend
himself
you
quite
wrong
uncle
he
said
i
working
hard
i
writing
a
history
of
the
family
a
history
of
the
family
groaned
vansittart
who
wants
one
who
read
one
from
an
antiquarian
point
of
view
began
charlie
stoutly
of
all
ways
of
wasting
time
antiquarianism
is
perhaps
the
most
futile
and
vansittart
wiped
his
mouth
with
an
air
of
finality
now
the
agatha
merceron
story
continued
charlie
is
in
itself
perhaps
we
better
finish
our
talk
tomorrow
the
ladies
will
expect
us
in
the
garden
all
right
said
charlie
with
much
content
he
enjoyed
himself
more
in
the
garden
for
while
lady
merceron
and
her
brother
in
law
took
counsel
he
strolled
through
the
moonlit
shrubberies
with
marland
and
marland
was
very
sympathetically
interested
in
him
and
his
pursuits
she
was
a
little
eager
woman
the
very
antithesis
in
body
and
mind
to
millie
bushell
she
had
plenty
of
brains
but
very
little
sense
a
good
deal
of
charm
but
no
beauty
and
without
any
counterbalancing
defect
at
all
a
hearty
liking
for
handsome
young
men
she
had
also
a
husband
in
the
city
again
mr
merceron
she
asked
glancing
up
at
charlie
who
was
puffing
happily
at
a
cigar
yes
he
answered
i
very
regular
and
did
you
see
anyone
i
saw
millie
bushell
miss
bushell
hardly
is
she
we
said
charlie
meditatively
i
suppose
if
one
was
fat
oneself
one
ghost
would
be
fat
would
it
marland
letting
the
problem
alone
laughed
softly
poor
miss
bushell
if
she
heard
you
say
that
or
if
lady
merceron
heard
you
it
would
hardly
surprise
my
mother
to
hear
that
i
thought
millie
bushell
plump
she
is
plump
you
know
and
charlie
eyes
expressed
a
candid
homage
to
truth
oh
i
know
what
being
arranged
for
you
so
do
i
and
you
do
it
oh
you
think
you
wo
but
you
will
men
always
end
by
doing
what
they
told
does
mr
marland
he
begins
by
it
laughed
his
wife
is
that
why
he
not
coming
till
saturday
week
merceron
but
what
was
miss
bushell
doing
at
the
pool
did
she
come
to
find
you
oh
no
just
for
a
walk
poor
girl
why
it
good
for
her
i
did
mean
the
walk
i
blush
if
there
was
light
enough
to
make
it
any
use
mrs
marland
oh
but
i
know
there
something
you
do
go
there
every
evening
to
look
for
a
dead
lady
mr
merceron
charlie
stopped
short
and
took
his
cigar
from
his
mouth
what
he
asked
a
little
abruptly
well
i
shall
follow
you
some
day
and
i
should
be
surprised
if
i
met
not
agatha
but
well
asked
charlie
with
an
uncertain
smile
why
poor
miss
bushell
charlie
laughed
and
replaced
his
cigar
what
are
we
standing
still
for
he
said
i
do
know
you
stopped
she
be
such
an
ideal
match
for
you
then
i
should
never
have
done
for
you
mrs
marland
my
dear
boy
i
was
married
when
you
were
still
in
eton
collars
they
had
completed
the
circuit
of
the
garden
and
now
approached
where
lady
merceron
sat
enveloped
in
a
shawl
charlie
she
called
here
a
letter
from
victor
button
he
coming
i
did
know
you
asked
him
said
charlie
with
no
sign
of
pleasure
at
the
news
victor
had
been
at
school
and
college
with
charlie
and
often
in
his
holidays
at
the
court
for
he
was
sir
victor
godson
yet
charlie
did
not
love
him
for
the
rest
he
was
very
rich
and
was
understood
to
cut
something
of
a
figure
in
london
society
sutton
oh
i
know
him
exclaimed
marland
he
charming
then
you
shall
entertain
him
said
charlie
i
resign
him
i
ca
think
why
you
not
more
pleased
to
have
him
here
charlie
remarked
lady
merceron
he
very
popular
in
london
is
he
vansittart
i
met
him
at
some
very
good
houses
answered
vansittart
and
that
he
seemed
to
imply
is
better
than
mere
popularity
the
bushells
were
delighted
with
him
last
time
he
was
here
continued
lady
merceron
there
a
rival
for
you
marland
whispered
charlie
laughed
cheerfully
sutton
would
be
no
rival
of
his
he
thought
and
if
he
and
millie
liked
one
another
by
all
means
let
them
take
one
another
a
month
before
he
would
hardly
have
dismissed
the
question
in
so
summary
a
fashion
for
the
habit
of
regarding
millie
as
a
possibility
and
her
readiness
as
a
fact
had
grown
strong
by
the
custom
of
years
and
far
as
he
was
from
a
passion
he
might
not
have
enjoyed
seeing
her
allegiance
transferred
to
victor
sutton
certainly
he
would
have
suffered
defeat
from
that
hand
with
very
bad
grace
now
however
everything
was
changed
vansittart
said
lady
merceron
charlie
and
i
want
to
consult
you
she
often
coupled
charlie
hypothetical
desire
for
advice
with
her
own
actual
one
in
appeals
to
vansittart
about
prime
rent
oh
at
the
old
farm
yes
he
wants
another
reduction
he
want
to
be
paid
for
staying
there
next
well
poor
man
he
had
to
take
lodgers
this
summer
a
thing
never
done
before
charlie
did
you
know
that
yes
said
charlie
interrupting
an
animated
conversation
which
he
had
started
with
marland
do
you
know
who
they
are
pursued
his
mother
wandering
from
prime
rent
to
the
more
interesting
subject
of
his
lodgers
ladies
from
london
answered
charlie
rather
vague
commented
vansittart
young
ladies
or
old
ladies
charlie
why
does
he
want
to
know
asked
marland
but
chaff
had
about
as
much
effect
on
vansittart
as
it
would
have
on
an
ironclad
he
seemed
not
to
hear
and
awaited
an
answer
with
a
bland
smile
in
truth
he
thought
marland
a
silly
woman
young
i
believe
answered
charlie
in
a
careless
tone
it
curious
i
not
seen
them
about
said
lady
merceron
i
pass
the
farm
almost
every
day
who
are
they
charlie
one
a
miss
wallace
she
engaged
to
willie
prime
to
willie
fancy
h
i
think
remarked
vansittart
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
reduction
of
rent
these
lodgers
are
a
delusion
of
course
she
stays
with
prime
if
she
going
to
many
his
son
fancy
willie
reiterated
lady
merceron
surely
he
ca
afford
to
marry
he
in
a
bank
you
know
vansittart
and
he
only
gets
a
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
a
year
one
blessing
of
the
country
is
that
everybody
knows
his
income
observed
vansittart
perhaps
the
lady
has
money
suggested
marland
but
merceron
who
the
other
lady
a
friend
of
miss
wallace
i
believe
i
do
know
her
name
oh
they
merely
friends
of
prime
vansittart
concluded
if
that
all
he
bases
his
claim
for
a
reduction
on
hang
it
he
might
as
well
have
it
interrupted
charlie
he
talks
to
me
about
it
for
half
an
hour
every
time
we
meet
but
my
dear
charlie
you
have
more
time
than
money
to
waste
at
least
so
it
seems
his
uncle
sarcasm
never
affected
charlie
temper
i
turn
him
on
to
you
uncle
he
replied
and
you
can
see
how
you
like
it
i
go
and
call
on
him
tomorrow
you
better
come
too
charlie
and
then
you
can
see
the
ladies
from
london
added
marland
perhaps
the
one
who
is
young
prime
will
be
interesting
or
said
charlie
as
mostly
happens
in
this
woeful
world
the
one
who
is
i
think
the
less
we
see
of
that
sort
of
person
at
all
the
better
observed
lady
merceron
with
gentle
decision
they
can
hardly
be
quite
what
we
accustomed
to
that
sort
of
person
charlie
went
to
bed
with
the
phrase
ringing
in
his
ears
if
to
be
the
most
beautiful
the
most
charming
and
the
most
refined
the
daintiest
the
wittiest
and
prettiest
the
kindest
and
the
sweetest
the
merriest
and
most
provoking
creature
in
the
whole
world
if
to
be
all
this
were
yet
not
to
weigh
against
being
sort
of
person
if
it
were
not
indeed
to
outweigh
banish
and
obliterate
everything
else
why
the
world
was
not
fit
to
live
in
and
he
no
true
merceron
for
the
merceron
men
had
always
pleased
themselves
chapter
iii
all
nonsense
on
the
evening
of
the
next
day
while
the
sun
was
still
on
the
pool
and
its
waters
forgetful
of
darker
moods
and
bygone
tragedies
smiled
under
the
tickling
of
darting
golden
gleams
a
girl
sat
on
the
broad
lowest
step
of
the
temple
she
had
rolled
the
sleeves
of
her
white
gown
above
her
elbow
up
to
her
shoulder
and
the
afternoon
being
sultry
from
time
to
time
dipped
her
arms
in
the
water
and
taking
them
out
again
amused
herself
by
watching
the
bright
drops
race
down
to
her
rosy
fingertips
the
sport
was
good
apparently
for
she
laughed
and
flung
back
her
head
so
that
the
stray
locks
of
hair
might
not
spoil
her
sight
of
it
on
either
side
of
this
lowest
step
there
was
a
margin
of
smooth
level
grass
and
being
unable
as
she
sat
to
bathe
both
arms
at
once
presently
she
moved
on
to
the
grass
and
lay
down
sinking
her
elbows
in
the
pond
and
leaning
her
face
over
the
edge
of
it
the
posture
had
another
advantage
she
had
not
thought
of
and
she
laughed
again
when
she
saw
her
own
eyes
twinkling
at
her
from
the
depths
as
she
lay
there
a
longing
came
upon
her
if
i
could
be
sure
he
would
come
i
dip
my
feet
she
murmured
as
however
he
had
come
every
evening
for
a
fortnight
past
the
fancy
was
not
to
be
indulged
and
she
consoled
herself
by
a
deeper
dive
yet
of
her
arms
and
by
drooping
her
head
till
her
nose
and
the
extreme
fringe
of
her
eyelashes
were
wetted
and
the
stray
locks
floated
on
either
side
presently
as
she
still
looked
she
saw
another
shadow
on
the
water
and
exchanged
with
her
image
a
confidential
glance
you
again
she
asked
the
other
shadow
nodded
why
did
you
come
in
the
canoe
because
people
see
it
it
struck
her
that
her
attitude
was
unconventional
and
by
a
lithe
complicated
movement
whereof
charlie
noticed
only
the
elegance
and
not
the
details
she
swept
round
and
sitting
looked
up
at
him
i
know
who
she
was
she
observed
she
very
nearly
knew
who
you
were
you
ought
to
have
come
to
the
window
she
thought
i
was
the
ghost
you
should
reckon
on
people
being
foolish
should
i
yet
i
reckoned
on
your
coming
or
there
have
been
some
more
of
me
in
the
water
i
wish
i
were
an
irregular
man
said
charlie
she
was
slowly
turning
down
her
sleeves
and
ignoring
his
remark
said
with
a
question
in
her
tones
nettie
wallace
says
that
willie
prime
says
that
everybody
says
that
you
going
to
marry
that
girl
i
believe
it
quite
true
oh
and
she
looked
across
the
pool
true
that
everybody
says
so
added
charlie
why
do
you
turn
down
your
sleeves
how
funny
i
must
have
looked
sprawling
on
the
bank
like
that
she
remarked
awful
said
charlie
sitting
down
she
looked
at
him
with
uneasiness
in
her
eye
nothing
but
an
ankle
i
swear
he
answered
she
blushed
and
smiled
i
think
you
should
whistle
or
something
as
you
come
not
i
said
charlie
with
decision
suddenly
she
turned
to
him
with
a
serious
face
or
one
that
tried
to
be
serious
why
do
you
come
she
asked
why
do
i
eat
he
returned
and
yet
you
were
angry
the
first
time
nobody
likes
to
be
caught
ranting
out
poetry
especially
his
own
i
believe
you
were
frightened
you
thought
i
was
agatha
the
poetry
was
about
her
was
it
it
not
at
all
a
bad
poem
observed
charlie
you
remember
i
liked
it
so
much
that
i
clapped
my
hands
and
i
jumped
the
girl
laughed
ah
well
she
said
it
time
to
go
home
oh
dear
no
said
charlie
but
i
promised
to
be
early
because
willie
prime
coming
and
to
be
introduced
to
him
willie
prime
can
wait
he
got
miss
wallace
to
comfort
him
and
got
nobody
to
comfort
me
oh
yes
miss
bushell
you
know
her
name
yes
and
yours
your
surname
i
mean
you
told
me
the
other
that
more
than
you
done
for
me
i
told
you
my
name
was
agatha
ah
but
that
was
a
joke
i
been
talking
about
agatha
merceron
very
well
i
sorry
it
does
satisfy
you
if
you
wo
believe
me
but
your
surname
oh
mine
why
mine
brown
brown
charlie
with
a
tinge
of
disappointment
in
his
tone
do
you
like
it
asked
miss
agatha
brown
with
a
smile
oh
it
will
do
for
the
present
laughed
charlie
well
i
do
mean
to
keep
it
all
my
life
i
spent
merceron
in
spying
out
your
house
nettie
wallace
and
i
ventured
quite
near
it
very
pretty
rather
dilapidated
i
afraid
what
the
time
mr
merceron
six
oh
by
jove
well
afraid
of
seeing
poor
agatha
i
should
see
nobody
but
you
if
you
were
here
no
i
forgot
that
i
got
to
meet
someone
at
the
station
at
a
seven
oh
do
tell
me
who
you
be
none
the
wiser
it
a
victor
sutton
victor
sutton
she
exclaimed
with
a
glance
at
charlie
which
passed
unnoticed
by
him
is
he
a
friend
of
yours
i
suppose
so
of
my
family
anyhow
i
going
she
announced
you
be
here
yes
for
the
last
time
she
dropped
this
astounding
thunderbolt
on
charlie
head
as
though
it
had
been
the
most
ordinary
remark
in
the
world
the
last
time
oh
miss
no
somehow
he
could
not
lay
his
tongue
to
that
miss
brown
i
ca
spend
all
my
life
in
lang
marsh
said
she
agatha
he
burst
out
no
no
this
is
not
the
last
time
we
keep
that
she
asked
with
a
provokingly
smile
you
promise
to
be
here
oh
yes
i
shall
have
something
to
say
to
you
then
charlie
announced
with
a
significant
air
oh
you
never
lack
conversation
you
be
here
at
five
precisely
she
answered
with
mock
gravity
and
now
i
gone
charlie
took
off
his
straw
hat
stretched
out
his
right
hand
and
took
hers
for
a
moment
she
drew
back
but
he
looked
very
handsome
and
gallant
as
he
bowed
his
head
down
to
her
hand
and
she
checked
the
movement
oh
well
she
murmured
she
was
protesting
against
any
importance
being
attached
to
the
incident
charlie
having
paid
his
homage
walked
or
rather
ran
swiftly
away
to
begin
with
he
had
none
too
much
time
if
he
was
to
meet
victor
sutton
secondly
he
was
full
of
a
big
resolve
and
that
generally
makes
a
man
walk
fast
the
lady
pursued
a
more
leisurely
progress
swinging
her
hat
in
her
hand
she
made
her
way
through
the
tangled
wood
back
to
the
and
turned
towards
prime
farm
she
went
slowly
along
thinking
perhaps
of
the
attractive
young
fellow
she
had
left
behind
her
wondering
perhaps
why
she
had
promised
to
meet
him
again
she
did
not
know
why
for
there
was
sure
to
happen
at
that
last
meeting
the
one
thing
which
she
did
not
she
supposed
wish
to
happen
however
a
promise
is
a
promise
she
heard
the
sound
of
wheels
behind
her
and
turning
found
the
farmer
hard
on
her
heels
the
farmer
was
driving
and
by
his
side
sat
a
girl
dressed
in
the
extreme
of
fashion
on
the
back
seat
was
a
young
man
in
a
very
light
suit
with
a
fine
check
pattern
and
a
new
pair
of
brown
leather
shoes
the
cart
pulled
up
we
can
make
room
for
ye
miss
said
old
prime
nettie
wallace
jumped
tip
and
stood
with
her
foot
on
the
step
willie
prime
jumped
down
and
effected
her
transfer
to
the
back
seat
agatha
climbed
up
beside
the
farmer
and
stretched
her
hand
back
to
greet
willie
willie
took
it
rather
timidly
he
did
not
quite
as
he
expressed
it
to
himself
his
fianc√©e
friend
was
very
simply
attired
infinitely
more
simply
than
nettie
herself
nettie
had
told
him
that
her
friend
was
and
on
a
vague
and
rather
obscure
qualification
of
the
statement
in
the
same
line
as
herself
namely
court
and
dressmaking
yet
there
was
a
difference
between
nettie
and
her
friend
anybody
else
arrived
by
the
train
asked
agatha
a
visitor
for
the
court
a
gentleman
was
he
willie
nettie
was
an
elegant
creature
and
but
for
the
and
that
slight
but
ineradicable
twang
that
clings
like
nessus
shirt
to
the
cockney
all
effort
and
all
education
notwithstanding
it
will
even
last
three
generations
and
is
audible
perhaps
now
and
then
in
the
house
of
lords
her
speech
was
correct
and
even
dainty
in
its
prim
nicety
ah
said
agatha
his
name
sutton
said
willie
charles
young
merceron
told
me
so
when
he
was
talking
to
me
on
the
platform
you
know
young
mr
merceron
asked
agatha
why
they
was
boys
together
interrupted
the
old
farmer
who
made
little
of
the
refinements
of
speech
in
his
youth
no
one
from
the
lord
to
the
laborer
spoke
grammar
in
the
country
used
to
larn
to
swim
together
in
the
pool
did
you
willie
i
must
have
a
dip
there
cried
willie
and
agatha
wondered
what
time
he
would
choose
and
i
take
you
there
nettie
ever
been
yet
no
they
they
say
it
haunted
do
they
willie
that
nonsense
said
willie
london
makes
a
man
sceptical
the
old
farmer
shook
his
head
and
grunted
doubtfully
his
mother
had
seen
poor
agatha
merceron
this
was
before
the
farmer
was
born
a
little
while
before
and
the
shock
had
come
nigh
to
being
most
serious
to
him
the
whole
countryside
knew
it
why
do
you
call
it
nonsense
mr
prime
asked
agatha
oh
i
do
know
miss
miss
brown
willie
said
nettie
miss
brown
anyway
we
need
go
the
time
the
ghost
comes
i
should
certainly
avoid
that
laughed
agatha
we
go
in
the
morning
nettie
and
i
have
my
swim
in
the
evening
agatha
frowned
it
would
be
particularly
inconvenient
if
willie
prime
took
his
swim
in
the
evening
oh
do
willie
cried
nettie
she
she
might
do
you
some
harm
willie
was
hard
to
persuade
he
was
not
above
liking
to
appear
a
daredevil
and
the
discussion
was
still
raging
when
they
reached
the
farm
the
two
girls
went
upstairs
to
the
little
rooms
which
they
occupied
agatha
turned
into
hers
and
nettie
wallace
followed
her
your
willie
is
very
nice
said
agatha
sitting
on
her
bed
nettie
smiled
with
pleasure
and
now
that
you
other
company
i
shall
go
you
going
miss
not
miss
nettie
laughed
i
forget
sometimes
she
said
well
you
must
remember
just
over
tomorrow
i
shall
go
next
day
i
must
meet
my
grandfather
in
london
nettie
offered
no
opposition
on
the
contrary
she
appeared
rather
relieved
nettie
did
you
like
sutton
looks
asked
agatha
after
a
pause
he
too
black
and
blue
for
my
taste
answered
nettie
willie
prime
was
red
and
yellow
blue
oh
you
mean
his
cheeks
yes
but
he
a
handsome
gentleman
all
the
same
and
you
should
have
seen
his
luggage
such
a
cost
fifty
pounds
i
daresay
oh
dear
me
said
agatha
yes
nettie
i
shall
go
the
day
after
merceron
asked
to
be
introduced
to
me
said
nettie
proudly
and
he
asked
where
you
were
he
said
he
seen
you
at
the
window
did
he
said
agatha
negligently
and
nettie
finding
the
conversation
flag
retired
to
her
own
room
agatha
sat
a
moment
longer
on
the
bed
what
a
very
deceitful
young
man
she
exclaimed
at
last
i
must
be
a
very
strict
secret
indeed
well
i
suppose
i
should
be
chapter
iv
a
catastrophe
at
the
pool
vansittart
merceron
was
not
quite
sure
that
victor
sutton
had
any
business
to
call
him
merceron
he
was
nearly
twenty
years
older
than
victor
and
a
man
of
considerable
position
nor
was
he
as
some
men
are
flattered
by
the
implication
of
contemporaneousness
carried
by
the
mode
of
address
but
it
is
hard
to
give
a
hint
to
a
man
who
has
no
inkling
that
there
is
room
for
one
and
when
vansittart
addressed
victor
as
sutton
the
latter
graciously
told
him
to
hang
the
mister
reciprocity
was
inevitable
and
the
elder
man
asked
himself
with
a
sardonic
grin
how
soon
he
would
be
van
coming
to
bathe
merceron
he
heard
under
his
window
at
eight
the
next
morning
we
off
to
the
pool
vansittart
shouted
an
emphatic
negative
and
the
two
young
fellows
started
off
by
themselves
charlie
manner
was
affected
by
the
ceremonious
courtesy
which
a
host
betrays
towards
a
guest
not
very
but
victor
did
not
notice
this
it
seldom
occurred
to
him
that
people
did
not
like
him
yes
he
was
saying
i
just
i
had
my
fling
charlie
and
now
i
shall
get
to
business
charlie
was
relieved
to
find
that
according
to
this
reckoning
he
had
several
more
years
before
him
next
year
pursued
victor
i
shall
marry
then
i
shall
go
into
parliament
and
then
i
shall
go
ahead
i
did
know
you
were
engaged
no
i
not
but
i
going
to
be
i
can
please
myself
you
see
got
lots
of
coin
oh
yes
but
can
you
please
the
lady
asked
charlie
my
dear
boy
began
victor
when
you
seen
a
little
more
of
the
world
here
we
are
said
charlie
why
hullo
who
that
a
dripping
head
and
a
blowing
mouth
were
visible
in
the
middle
of
the
pool
willie
prime
by
jove
willie
and
charlie
set
about
flinging
off
his
flannels
victor
following
his
example
in
a
more
leisurely
fashion
willie
prime
was
a
little
puzzled
to
know
how
he
ought
to
treat
charlie
he
had
been
in
very
old
days
then
master
charlie
that
was
willie
mother
doing
then
charles
but
now
willie
had
set
up
for
himself
he
had
played
billiards
with
a
lord
and
football
against
the
sybarites
and
incidentally
hobnobbed
with
quite
great
people
it
is
not
very
easy
to
assert
a
social
position
when
one
has
nothing
on
and
only
one
head
out
of
water
but
willie
did
it
er
merceron
said
he
victor
heard
him
and
put
up
his
eyeglass
in
amazement
but
he
in
his
turn
had
only
a
shirt
on
and
the
hauteur
was
a
failure
charlie
utterly
failed
to
notice
the
incident
is
it
cold
he
shouted
beastly
answered
willie
the
man
who
has
got
in
always
tells
the
man
who
is
going
to
get
in
that
it
is
beastly
cold
here
goes
cried
charlie
and
a
minute
later
he
was
treading
water
by
willie
side
miss
wallace
all
fit
he
asked
thank
you
yes
she
all
right
and
her
friend
all
right
i
believe
and
when
is
it
to
be
old
fellow
soon
as
i
get
a
rise
what
asked
the
unsophisticated
charlie
who
knew
the
phrase
chiefly
in
connection
with
fish
a
rise
of
screw
you
know
oh
ah
yes
what
a
fool
i
am
and
charlie
disappeared
beneath
the
waves
when
they
were
all
on
the
bank
drying
willie
encouraged
by
not
being
discouraged
save
by
sutton
silence
in
his
advances
ventured
further
and
asked
in
a
joking
tone
and
are
you
marked
off
yet
we
been
expecting
to
hear
of
it
for
the
last
twelve
months
what
do
you
mean
why
you
and
miss
bushell
charlie
struggled
through
his
shirt
and
then
answered
with
his
first
touch
of
distance
nothing
in
it
people
got
no
business
to
gossip
it
damned
impertinent
observed
victor
sutton
in
slow
and
deliberate
tones
willie
flushed
i
beg
pardon
he
said
gruffly
i
only
repeated
what
i
heard
my
dear
fellow
no
harm
done
cried
charlie
who
was
the
fool
well
in
fact
my
father
the
situation
was
awkward
but
they
wisely
eluded
it
by
laughter
but
a
thought
struck
charlie
i
say
did
your
father
state
it
as
a
fact
oh
no
but
as
a
certainty
you
know
when
last
night
at
supper
charlie
brow
clouded
miss
b
that
is
agatha
was
certain
to
have
been
at
supper
however
all
that
could
be
put
right
in
the
evening
that
one
blessed
evening
left
to
him
he
looked
at
willie
and
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
but
he
shut
it
again
it
did
not
seem
to
him
that
he
could
question
willie
prime
about
the
lady
she
had
chosen
to
tell
him
nothing
and
her
will
was
his
law
but
he
was
yearning
to
know
what
she
was
and
how
she
came
there
he
refrained
and
this
time
virtue
really
had
a
reward
beyond
itself
for
willie
would
blithely
have
told
him
that
she
was
a
dressmaker
he
called
nettie
however
the
manager
of
a
court
modiste
business
and
that
would
not
have
pleased
charlie
it
was
all
very
well
for
charlie
to
count
on
that
blessed
evening
but
he
reckoned
without
his
host
or
rather
without
his
guests
the
bushells
came
to
lunch
millie
driving
her
terrified
mother
in
a
lofty
gig
and
at
lunch
millie
recounted
her
vision
of
agatha
merceron
she
did
not
believe
it
of
course
but
it
was
queer
was
it
victor
sutton
rose
to
the
bait
at
once
we
investigate
it
he
cried
merceron
he
meant
the
patient
vansittart
did
yon
once
write
an
article
on
for
yes
i
proved
there
were
none
answered
vansittart
that
impossible
you
know
remarked
marland
gently
we
put
you
to
the
proof
this
very
evening
declared
sutton
charlie
started
are
you
game
miss
bushell
continued
victor
ye
yes
if
you
keep
quite
near
me
answered
millie
with
a
playful
shudder
charlie
reflected
how
ill
playfulness
became
her
and
frowned
but
millie
was
pleased
to
see
him
frown
she
enjoyed
showing
him
that
other
men
liked
to
keep
quite
near
to
her
then
this
evening
we
go
in
a
body
to
the
pool
i
shall
not
go
shuddered
marland
an
hour
after
sunset
half
an
hour
she
might
be
early
and
we
stay
half
an
hour
after
we
give
her
a
fair
show
come
thought
charlie
i
shall
get
an
hour
with
agatha
you
come
charlie
asked
victor
oh
all
right
he
answered
hiding
all
signs
of
vexation
he
could
get
back
by
six
and
join
the
party
but
why
was
marland
looking
at
him
the
first
step
however
towards
getting
back
is
to
get
there
and
charlie
found
this
none
so
easy
after
lunch
came
and
he
was
impressed
vansittart
played
a
game
and
victor
had
found
little
leisure
for
this
modest
sport
among
his
more
ambitious
amusements
charlie
had
to
balance
millie
bushell
and
he
spent
a
very
hot
and
wearying
afternoon
they
would
go
on
victor
declared
it
was
good
for
him
uncle
van
delighted
in
a
hard
game
it
appeared
to
be
a
very
hard
game
to
him
from
the
number
of
strokes
he
missed
and
millie
grew
in
vigor
ubiquity
and
it
must
be
added
intensity
of
color
as
the
hours
wore
away
it
was
close
on
five
before
charlie
with
a
groan
could
throw
down
his
racquet
poor
boy
said
marland
charlie
dear
called
lady
merceron
who
had
been
talking
comfortably
to
bushell
in
the
shade
come
and
hand
the
tea
i
sure
you
must
all
want
some
millie
my
dear
how
hot
you
look
she
never
will
take
any
care
of
her
complexion
complained
bushell
take
care
of
your
stom
your
health
and
your
complexion
will
take
care
of
itself
observed
vansittart
charlie
where
is
the
boy
called
lady
merceron
again
the
boy
was
gone
he
was
flying
as
fast
as
his
legs
would
take
him
to
the
pool
where
was
that
cherished
interview
now
he
could
hope
only
for
a
few
wretched
minutes
hardly
enough
to
say
once
before
he
must
hustle
yes
positively
hustle
agatha
out
of
sight
he
had
heard
that
abominable
sutton
remark
that
they
might
as
well
start
directly
after
tea
he
was
breathless
when
he
burst
through
the
willows
but
there
he
came
to
a
sudden
a
dead
stop
and
then
drew
back
into
shelter
again
there
on
the
bank
scarcely
a
dozen
feet
from
it
sat
two
people
young
man
with
his
arm
round
a
young
woman
waist
willie
prime
and
nettie
wallace
by
all
that
damnable
as
sir
peter
says
charlie
said
something
quite
as
forcible
he
felt
for
his
watch
but
he
had
left
it
with
his
waistcoat
on
the
lawn
what
was
the
time
was
it
going
quickly
or
slowly
could
he
afford
to
wait
or
must
he
run
round
to
the
road
and
intercept
agatha
five
minutes
passed
in
vacillation
i
go
and
stop
her
he
said
and
began
a
cautious
retreat
as
he
moved
he
heard
willie
voice
well
my
dear
let
be
off
said
willie
nettie
rose
with
a
sigh
of
content
adjusted
her
hat
coquettishly
and
smoothed
her
skirts
i
ready
willie
it
been
beautiful
has
it
they
came
towards
charlie
evidently
they
intended
to
regain
the
road
by
the
same
path
as
he
had
chosen
indeed
from
that
side
of
the
pool
there
was
no
choice
unless
one
clambered
round
by
the
muddy
bank
we
must
make
haste
said
willie
father
want
his
tea
if
they
made
haste
they
would
be
close
on
his
heels
charlie
shrank
back
behind
a
willow
and
let
them
go
by
then
quick
as
thought
rushed
to
his
canoe
and
paddled
across
up
the
steps
and
into
the
temple
he
rushed
she
was
there
fate
is
too
hard
for
the
best
of
us
sometimes
charlie
sat
down
and
stretching
out
his
legs
stared
gloomily
at
his
toes
thus
he
must
have
sat
nearly
ten
minutes
when
a
head
was
put
round
the
corinthian
pilaster
of
the
doorway
poor
boy
am
i
very
late
charlie
leapt
up
and
forward
breathlessly
blurting
out
joy
tempered
by
uneasiness
agatha
gathered
the
difficulty
of
the
position
well
said
she
smiling
i
must
disappear
and
you
must
go
back
to
your
friends
no
said
charlie
i
must
talk
to
you
but
they
may
come
any
moment
i
do
care
oh
but
i
do
charlie
what
the
matter
oh
did
i
ever
call
you
before
well
charlie
if
you
love
me
yes
i
know
not
let
these
people
see
me
all
right
come
along
i
take
you
to
the
road
and
come
back
hullo
what
that

them
exclaimed
the
lady
it
was
the
pair

back
into
the
temple
on
the
opposite
bank
stood
millie
bushell
vansittart
and
victor
sutton
hullo
there
charlie
you
thief
cried
victor

that
canoe
over
here
miss
bushell

to
the
temple
hush

whispered
agatha
but
they
know
i
here
they
see
that
confounded
canoe
charlie
charlie
was
shouted
across
in
three
voices
what
the
devil
muttered
charlie
they
must
see
me
urged
agatha
victor
sutton
voice
rose
clear
and
distinct
i
unearth
him
he
cried
i
know
the
way
round
you
wait
here
with
miss
bushell
merceron
oh
he
coming
round
i
must
chance
it
said
charlie
and
he
came
out
of
hiding
a
cry
greeted
him
victor
was
already
started
but
stopped
charlie
embarked
and
shot
across
you
villain
you
gave
us
the
slip
cried
uncle
van
miss
bushell
began
quietly
to
embark
uncle
van
followed
her
example
oh
merceron
you
sink
us
cried
millie
charlie
sat
glum
and
silent
the
situation
beat
him
completely
uncle
van
drew
back
millie
seized
the
paddle
and
propelled
the
canoe
out
from
the
bank
you
come
round
with
me
merceron
called
sutton
and
the
two
men
turned
to
the
path
no
added
victor
look
here
we
can
climb
round
here
and
he
pointed
to
the
bank
there
was
a
little
narrow
muddy
track
but
it
was
enough
the
canoe
was
across
the
two
men
victor
leading
at
a
good
pace
were
round
charlie
glanced
at
the
window
of
the
temple
and
caught
a
fleeting
glance
of
a
despairing
face
if
you
love
me
they
must
see
me
here
give
me
the
paddle
he
exclaimed
and
reached
forward
for
it
no
i
can
do
it
answered
millie
lifting
the
instrument
out
of
his
reach
charlie
stepped
forward
rather
he
jumped
forward
as
a
man
jumps
over
a
ditch
there
was
a
shriek
from
millie
the
canoe
swayed
tottered
and
upset
in
a
confused
mass
millie
bushell
and
charlie
were
hurled
into
the
water
victor
and
uncle
van
hardly
five
yards
from
the
steps
turned
in
amazement
help
help
screamed
millie
help
echoed
charlie
i
ca
hold
her
up
victor
come
and
help
me
uncle
van
come
along
the
devil
murmured
uncle
van
quick
quick
called
charlie
and
victor
with
a
vexed
laugh
peeled
off
his
coat
and
jumped
in
vansittart
stood
with
a
puzzled
air
then
a
happy
thought
struck
him
he
turned
and
trotted
back
the
way
he
had
come
he
would
get
a
rope
as
he
went
as
victor
reached
the
stragglers
in
the
water
a
slim
figure
in
white
with
a
smile
on
her
face
stole
cautiously
from
the
temple
and
disappeared
in
the
wood
behind
charlie
saw
her
go
but
he
held
poor
millie
head
remorselessly
tight
towards
the
other
bank
and
that
was
the
last
he
saw
of
the
lady
of
the
pool
millie
bushell
landed
her
dripping
clothes
clinging
round
her
victor
was
shivering
for
the
evening
had
turned
chilly
uncle
van
had
a
bit
of
rope
from
the
in
his
hand
and
a
doubtful
smile
on
his
face
we
best
get
miss
bushel
home
he
suggested
and
they
started
in
gloomy
procession
charlie
in
remorse
gave
millie
his
arm
oh
how
could
you
she
murmured
piteously
she
was
cold
she
was
wet
and
she
was
sure
that
she
looked
frightful
i
i
did
do
it
on
purpose
charlie
blurted
out
eagerly
on
purpose
well
i
suppose
not
she
exclaimed
bewildered
charlie
flushed
victor
shot
a
swift
glance
at
him
home
they
met
marland
and
the
whole
affair
had
to
be
explained
to
her
charlie
essayed
the
task
still
i
do
see
how
you
managed
to
upset
the
canoe
observed
marland
no
more
do
i
said
victor
sutton
charlie
gave
it
up
i
so
sorry
millie
he
whispered
you
must
try
to
forgive
me
so
once
again
the
coast
was
left
clear
for
agatha
merceron
if
she
came
that
night
but
whether
she
did
or
not
the
other
agatha
came
no
more
and
charlie
great
resolve
went
unfulfilled
yet
the
next
evening
he
went
alone
to
the
temple
and
he
found
lying
on
the
floor
a
little
handkerchief
trimmed
with
lace
and
embroidered
with
the
name
of
agatha
this
he
put
in
his
pocket
thanking
heaven
that
his
desperate
manoeuvre
had
kept
the
shrine
inviolate
the
day
before
poor
millie
said
he
but
then
i
had
to
do
it
i
hear
remarked
lady
merceron
a
few
days
later
that
one
of
prime
friends
has
left
him
not
willie
young
lady
the
other
has
she
asked
charlie
no
one
pursued
the
subject
and
after
a
moment
pause
marland
who
was
sitting
next
to
charlie
asked
him
in
a
low
voice
whether
he
had
been
to
the
pool
that
evening
no
answered
charlie
i
do
go
every
night
oh
poor
dear
miss
bushell
laughed
marland
and
when
charlie
looked
inquiringly
at
her
she
shook
her
head
you
see
i
know
something
of
young
men
she
explained
chapter
v
an
unforeseen
case
i
wish
to
goodness
remarked
the
reverend
sigismund
taylor
rubbing
the
bridge
of
his
nose
with
a
corner
of
the
manual
that
the
vicar
had
never
introduced
auricular
confession
it
may
be
in
accordance
with
the
practice
of
the
primitive
church
but
one
does
meet
with
such
very
curious
cases
there
nothing
the
least
like
it
in
the
manual
he
opened
the
book
and
searched
its
pages
over
again
no
the
case
had
not
been
foreseen
it
must
be
included
in
those
which
were
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
priest
it
a
poor
manual
said
taylor
throwing
it
down
and
putting
his
hands
in
the
pocket
of
his
cassock
poor
girl
she
was
quite
distressed
too
i
must
have
something
to
tell
her
when
she
comes
next
week
taylor
had
in
face
of
the
difficulty
taken
time
to
consider
and
the
penitent
had
gone
away
in
suspense
to
represent
oneself
as
a
dressmaker
well
there
was
nothing
very
outrageous
in
that
it
was
unbecoming
but
venial
to
tell
sundry
fibs
by
way
of
supporting
the
assumed
character
the
manual
was
equal
to
that
but
the
rest
of
the
disclosure
was
the
crux
wrong
no
doubt
was
the
conduct
but
how
wrong
that
made
all
the
difference
and
then
there
followed
another
question
what
ought
to
be
done
she
had
asked
for
advice
about
that
also
and
although
such
counsel
was
not
strictly
incumbent
on
him
he
felt
that
he
ought
not
to
refuse
it
altogether
he
was
puzzled
at
one
can
not
be
ready
for
everything
yet
she
had
implored
him
to
consult
nobody
else
and
decide
for
her
himself
such
trust
in
you
she
had
said
wiping
away
an
incipient
teardrop
and
although
taylor
told
her
that
the
individual
was
nothing
and
the
office
everything
he
had
been
rather
gratified
thinking
that
a
turn
in
the
open
air
might
clear
his
brain
and
enable
him
better
to
grapple
with
this
very
thorny
question
he
changed
his
cassock
for
a
long
tailed
coat
put
on
his
wide
awake
and
leaving
the
precincts
of
edward
confessor
struck
across
park
lane
and
along
the
row
he
passed
several
people
he
knew
both
men
and
women
marland
was
there
attended
by
two
young
men
and
a
little
farther
on
he
saw
old
lord
thrapston
tottering
along
on
his
stick
lord
thrapston
hated
a
parson
and
scowled
at
poor
taylor
as
he
went
by
taylor
shrank
from
meeting
his
eye
and
hurried
along
till
he
reached
the
serpentine
where
he
stood
still
for
a
few
minutes
drinking
in
the
fresh
breeze
but
the
breeze
could
not
blow
his
puzzle
out
of
his
brain
was
it
a
crime
or
merely
an
escapade
what
had
she
said
to
the
young
man
what
had
her
feelings
been
or
become
towards
the
young
man
moreover
what
had
she
caused
the
young
man
feelings
to
be
for
her
when
he
came
to
think
it
over
taylor
discovered
with
a
shock
of
surprise
that
on
all
these
distinctly
material
points
the
confession
had
been
singularly
incomplete
he
was
ashamed
of
this
for
of
course
it
was
his
business
to
make
the
confession
full
and
exhaustive
he
could
only
plead
that
at
the
moment
it
had
seemed
thorough
and
candid
an
unreserved
revelation
yet
those
points
did
as
a
fact
remain
obscure
i
wish
i
knew
a
little
more
about
human
nature
sighed
taylor
he
was
thinking
of
one
division
of
human
nature
and
it
is
likely
enough
that
he
knew
next
to
nothing
of
it
a
hand
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
and
with
a
start
he
turned
round
a
tall
young
man
in
a
new
and
a
faultless
hat
stood
by
him
smiling
at
him
what
charlie
old
fellow
cried
taylor
where
do
you
spring
from
charlie
explained
that
he
was
up
in
town
for
a
month
or
two
it
splendid
to
meet
you
first
day
i
was
going
to
look
you
up
he
said
sigismund
taylor
and
charlie
had
been
intimate
friends
at
oxford
although
charlie
was
as
time
counts
there
very
considerably
the
junior
for
the
last
two
or
three
years
they
had
hardly
met
but
what
are
you
up
for
oh
well
you
see
my
uncle
wants
me
to
get
called
to
the
bar
or
something
so
i
ran
tip
to
have
a
look
into
it
will
that
take
a
month
look
here
old
fellow
i
got
nothing
else
to
do
i
do
see
why
i
should
stretch
it
to
three
months
besides
i
want
to
spend
some
time
with
my
ancestors
with
your
ancestors
in
the
british
museum
i
writing
a
book
about
them
queer
lot
some
of
them
were
too
of
course
i
specially
interested
in
agatha
merceron
but
i
suppose
you
never
heard
of
her
taylor
confessed
his
ignorance
and
charlie
taking
his
arm
walked
him
up
and
down
the
bank
while
he
talked
on
his
pet
subject
agatha
merceron
was
always
interesting
and
just
now
anything
about
the
pool
was
interesting
for
there
was
one
reason
for
his
visit
to
london
which
he
had
not
disclosed
nettie
wallace
had
when
he
met
her
one
day
incautiously
dropped
a
word
which
seemed
to
imply
that
the
other
agatha
was
often
in
london
nettie
tried
to
recall
her
words
but
the
mischief
was
done
and
charlie
became
more
than
ever
convinced
that
he
would
grow
rusty
if
he
stayed
always
at
langbury
court
in
fact
he
could
suffer
it
no
longer
and
to
town
he
went
for
a
long
while
sigismund
taylor
listened
with
no
more
than
average
interest
to
charlie
story
but
it
chanced
that
one
word
caught
his
notice
she
comes
out
of
the
temple
said
charlie
in
the
voice
of
hushed
reverence
with
which
he
was
wont
to
talk
of
the
unhappy
lady
out
of
where
asked
taylor
the
temple
oh
i
forgot
the
temple
is
and
charlie
gave
a
description
which
need
not
be
repeated
temple
temple
where
had
he
heard
of
a
temple
lately
taylor
cudgelled
his
brains
why
why
yes
she
had
spoken
of
a
temple
she
said
they
met
in
a
temple
it
was
a
strange
coincidence
the
word
had
struck
him
at
the
time
but
then
everybody
knows
that
at
a
certain
period
it
was
common
enough
to
put
up
these
little
classical
erections
as
a
memorial
or
merely
as
an
ornament
to
it
must
be
a
mere
coincidence
but
taylor
stopped
short
what
up
asked
charlie
who
had
finished
his
narrative
and
was
now
studying
the
faces
of
the
ladies
who
rode
past
nothing
answered
taylor
and
really
it
was
not
much
taken
by
itself
entirely
unworthy
of
notice
even
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
temple
of
no
real
significance
that
he
could
see
still
it
was
a
whimsical
thing
that
as
had
just
struck
him
charlie
spectre
should
be
named
agatha
but
it
came
to
nothing
how
could
the
name
of
charlie
spectre
have
anything
to
do
with
that
of
his
penitent
presently
charlie
too
fell
into
silence
he
beat
his
stick
moodily
against
his
leg
and
looked
glum
and
absent
ah
well
he
said
at
last
poor
agatha
was
hardly
used
she
paid
part
of
the
debt
we
owe
woman
taylor
raised
his
brows
and
smiled
at
this
gloomily
misogynistic
sentiment
he
had
the
perception
to
grasp
in
a
moment
what
it
indicated
his
young
friend
was
or
had
lately
been
or
thought
he
was
likely
to
be
a
lover
and
an
unhappy
one
but
he
did
not
press
charlie
confessions
were
no
luxury
to
him
presently
they
began
to
walk
back
and
charlie
saying
he
had
to
dine
with
victor
button
made
an
appointment
to
see
taylor
again
and
left
him
striking
across
the
row
taylor
strolled
on
and
finding
marland
still
in
her
seat
sat
down
by
her
she
was
surprised
and
pleased
to
hear
that
charlie
was
in
town
i
left
him
at
home
in
deep
dumps
you
never
been
to
langbury
court
have
you
taylor
shook
his
head
such
a
sweet
old
place
but
of
course
rather
dull
for
a
young
man
with
nobody
hut
his
mother
and
just
one
or
two
slow
country
neighbors
oh
a
run
do
him
good
yes
he
was
quite
moped
and
marland
glanced
at
her
companion
she
wanted
only
a
very
little
encouragement
to
impart
her
suspicions
to
him
it
must
in
justice
to
marland
be
remembered
that
she
had
always
found
the
simplest
explanation
of
charlie
devotion
to
the
pool
hard
to
accept
and
the
most
elaborate
demonstration
of
how
a
canadian
canoe
may
be
upset
unconvincing
you
a
great
friend
of
his
are
you
pursued
marland
so
i
suppose
there
no
harm
in
mentioning
my
suspicions
to
you
indeed
i
daresay
you
could
be
of
use
to
him
i
mean
persuade
him
to
be
wise
i
afraid
taylor
that
he
is
in
some
entanglement
dear
dear
murmured
taylor
oh
i
no
positive
proof
but
i
fear
so
and
a
very
undesirable
entanglement
too
with
someone
quite
beneath
him
yes
i
think
i
had
better
tell
you
about
it
taylor
sat
silent
and
save
for
a
start
or
two
motionless
while
his
companion
detailed
her
circumstantial
evidence
whether
it
was
enough
to
prove
marland
case
or
not
whether
that
is
it
is
inconceivable
that
a
young
man
should
go
to
any
place
fourteen
evenings
running
and
upset
a
friend
of
his
youth
out
of
a
canoe
except
there
be
a
lady
involved
is
perhaps
doubtful
but
it
was
more
than
enough
to
show
sigismund
taylor
that
the
confession
he
had
listened
to
was
based
upon
fact
and
that
charlie
merceron
was
the
other
party
to
those
stolen
interviews
into
whose
exact
degree
of
heinousness
he
was
now
inquiring
this
knowledge
caused
taylor
to
feel
that
he
was
in
an
awkward
position
now
asked
marland
candidly
taylor
can
you
suppose
anything
else
than
that
our
friend
charlie
was
carrying
on
a
very
pronounced
flirtation
with
this
dressmaker
dressmaker
her
friend
was
and
i
believe
she
was
too
something
of
the
kind
anyhow
you
you
never
saw
the
the
other
person
no
she
kept
out
of
the
way
that
looks
bad
does
it
no
doubt
she
was
a
tawdry
vulgar
creature
but
a
man
never
notices
that
at
this
moment
two
people
were
seen
approaching
one
of
them
was
a
man
of
middle
height
and
perhaps
years
of
age
he
was
stout
and
he
had
a
fat
face
with
bulging
cheeks
his
eyes
were
rather
like
a
frog
he
leant
very
much
forward
as
he
walked
and
swayed
gently
from
side
to
side
with
a
rolling
swagger
and
as
his
body
rolled
his
eye
rolled
too
and
he
looked
this
way
and
that
with
a
jovial
leer
and
a
smile
of
contentment
and
amusement
on
his
face
the
smile
and
the
merry
eye
redeemed
his
appearance
from
blank
ugliness
but
neither
of
them
indicated
a
spiritual
or
exalted
mind
by
his
side
walked
a
girl
dressed
as
marland
enviously
admitted
as
really
very
few
women
in
london
could
dress
and
wearing
in
virtue
perhaps
of
the
dress
perhaps
of
other
more
precious
gifts
an
air
of
assured
perfection
and
dainty
disdain
she
was
listening
to
her
companion
conversation
and
did
not
notice
sigismund
taylor
with
whom
she
was
well
acquainted
dear
me
who
are
those
i
wonder
exclaimed
marland
she
very
distingu√©e
it
miss
glyn
answered
he
what
miss
agatha
glyn
yes
he
replied
wondering
whether
that
little
coincidence
as
to
the
would
suggest
itself
to
anyone
else
lord
thrapston
granddaughter
yes
horrid
old
man
is
he
i
know
him
very
slightly
and
the
man
who
he
calder
wentworth
to
be
sure
why
they
engaged
are
they
i
saw
it
in
the
paper
i
sure
i
do
know
said
taylor
in
a
voice
more
troubled
than
the
matter
seemed
to
require
i
saw
it
in
the
paper
too
he
no
beauty
at
any
rate
but
he
a
great
match
i
suppose
oh
perhaps
it
is
true
you
speak
as
if
you
wished
it
was
i
heard
about
wentworth
from
victor
sutton
you
know
who
i
mean
and
marland
proceeded
to
give
some
particulars
of
calder
wentworth
career
meanwhile
that
gentleman
himself
was
telling
agatha
glyn
a
very
humorous
story
agatha
did
not
laugh
suddenly
she
interrupted
him
why
do
you
ask
me
more
about
it
i
thought
you
tell
me
if
you
wanted
me
to
know
he
answered
you
are
the
most
insufferable
man
do
you
care
in
the
least
what
i
do
or
where
i
go
got
perfect
confidence
in
you
said
calder
politely
i
do
deserve
it
oh
i
daresay
not
but
it
so
much
more
comfortable
for
me
i
disappeared
simply
disappeared
for
a
fortnight
and
you
never
asked
where
i
went
or
what
i
did
or
or
anything
have
i
where
did
you
go
i
ca
tell
you
there
you
see
what
the
dickens
was
the
good
of
my
asking
if
you
knew
what
i
did
i
suppose
you
never
speak
to
me
again
all
right
keep
it
dark
then
please
for
one
tiling
i
met
no
i
wo
i
never
asked
you
to
you
know
they
walked
on
a
little
way
in
silence
met
young
sutton
at
lunch
observed
calder
he
been
rusticating
with
some
relations
of
old
van
merceron
they
got
a
nice
place
apparently
i
particularly
dislike
mr
sutton
all
right
he
come
when
we
married
eh
what
i
did
speak
said
miss
glyn
who
had
certainly
done
something
beg
pardon
smiled
calder
victor
told
me
rather
a
joke
it
appears
there
a
young
merceron
and
the
usual
rustic
beauty
do
you
know
forget
the
name
but
a
fat
girl
victor
said
and
awfully
gone
on
young
merceron
well
there
a
pond
or
something
how
long
will
this
story
last
asked
miss
glyn
with
a
tragic
air
it
an
uncommon
amusing
one
protested
calder
he
upset
her
in
the
pond
and
do
you
mind
finishing
it
some
other
time
oh
all
right
thought
it
interest
you
it
does
never
knew
such
a
girl
no
sense
of
humor
commented
calder
with
a
shake
of
his
head
and
a
backward
roll
of
his
eye
towards
his
companion
but
it
makes
such
a
difference
whether
a
story
is
new
to
the
hearer
chapter
vi
there
was
somebody
two
worlds
and
half
a
dozen
industries
had
conspired
to
shower
gold
on
calder
wentworth
head
there
was
land
in
the
family
brought
by
his
grandmother
there
was
finance
on
the
paternal
side
whence
came
a
portuguese
title
carefully
eschewed
by
calder
there
had
been
a
london
street
half
a
a
south
african
mine
and
the
better
part
of
an
american
railway
the
street
and
the
remained
the
mine
and
the
railway
had
been
sold
at
the
top
of
the
market
about
the
same
time
the
family
name
became
wentworth
it
had
been
stripes
which
was
felt
to
be
absurd
and
the
family
itself
began
to
take
an
exalted
place
in
society
the
rise
was
the
easier
because
when
old
died
young
calder
wentworth
became
the
only
representative
and
a
rich
young
bachelor
can
rise
lightly
to
heights
inaccessible
to
the
feet
of
less
happily
situated
folk
it
seemed
part
of
providence
benevolence
that
when
lady
forteville
asked
how
many
women
there
were
the
answer
could
be
whereupon
the
countess
at
once
invited
calder
wentworth
to
dinner
calder
went
and
rolled
his
frog
eyes
with
much
amusement
when
the
lady
asked
him
to
what
wentworths
he
belonged
for
as
he
observed
to
miss
glyn
whom
he
had
the
pleasure
of
escorting
his
wentworths
were
an
entirely
new
brand
and
lady
forteville
knew
it
as
well
as
if
she
had
read
the
letters
patent
and
invented
the
wentworth
merceron
said
victor
sutton
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
i
believe
i
know
an
uncle
of
yours
an
uncommon
clever
fellow
said
calder
unfolding
his
napkin
and
glancing
round
the
of
the
themis
club
oh
uncle
van
yes
we
consider
him
our
leading
article
quite
so
i
heard
a
bit
about
you
too
something
about
a
canoe
eh
charlie
looked
somewhat
disturbed
ought
sutton
to
have
told
me
well
it
too
late
now
because
told
half
a
dozen
fellows
but
there
nothing
to
tell
well
i
told
it
to
old
thrapston
you
do
know
him
do
you
cunningest
old
boy
in
london
upon
my
honor
you
know
i
should
like
to
be
like
old
thrapston
not
when
i
was
getting
old
you
know
too
well
what
did
he
say
asked
victor
he
said
what
you
never
had
the
sense
to
see
my
boy
but
i
expect
merceron
wo
be
obliged
to
me
for
repeating
it
i
should
like
to
hear
it
said
charlie
with
necessary
politeness
well
it
not
me
its
old
thrapston
and
if
you
say
it
wrong
believe
yon
old
thrapston
hang
it
victor
that
old
man
ought
to
be
hanged
why
only
the
other
day
i
saw
him
do
stick
to
the
point
groaned
victor
all
right
well
he
said
lay
a
guinea
there
was
a
and
he
winked
his
sinful
old
eye
you
know
for
all
the
world
like
a
d
in
a
cathedral
one
of
those
hideous
i
say
what
is
the
word
victor
i
saw
when
agatha
took
me
beg
pardon
merceron
was
the
world
full
of
agathas
if
so
it
would
be
well
not
to
start
whenever
one
was
mentioned
charlie
recovered
himself
i
think
you
must
mean
a
gargoyle
he
said
wondering
who
this
agatha
might
be
of
course
i
do
fancy
forgetting
that
gargoyle
of
course
well
old
thrapston
said
lay
a
guinea
there
was
a
woman
in
that
dashed
summer
house
calder
my
boy
victor
button
eyes
lighted
with
a
gleam
well
i
hanged
if
i
ever
thought
of
that
charlie
you
held
us
all
bosh
said
charlie
merceron
there
was
no
one
there
all
right
but
there
ought
to
have
been
you
know
to
give
interest
to
the
position
honor
bright
charlie
asked
victor
sutton
shut
up
sutton
interposed
calder
he
not
in
the
divorce
court
let
change
the
subject
charlie
was
in
a
difficulty
but
the
better
course
seemed
to
be
to
allow
the
subject
to
be
changed
in
spite
of
the
wink
that
accompanied
calder
suggestion
all
right
said
victor
how
is
miss
glyn
wentworth
oh
she
all
right
she
been
in
the
country
for
a
bit
but
back
now
and
when
is
the
happy
event
to
be
calder
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
and
remarked
deliberately
i
have
my
dear
boy
the
least
idea
i
should
hurry
her
up
laughed
sutton
i
just
like
now
i
should
just
like
to
put
you
in
my
shoes
for
half
an
hour
and
see
you
hurry
up
agatha
she
could
eat
me
eat
you
no
but
she
flatten
you
out
so
that
you
go
under
that
door
and
leave
room
for
the
jolly
draught
there
is
all
the
same
sutton
laughed
complacently
well
you
a
patient
man
he
observed
for
my
part
i
like
a
thing
to
be
off
or
on
it
came
to
charlie
merceron
almost
as
a
surprise
to
find
that
impudence
he
could
call
it
by
no
other
name
was
not
reserved
for
his
juniors
or
for
young
men
from
the
country
but
calder
took
it
quite
contenting
himself
with
observing
well
it
was
very
soon
off
in
your
case
was
it
old
fellow
sutton
flushed
i
told
you
before
that
that
not
true
he
said
angrily
calder
laughed
all
right
all
right
we
used
to
think
once
upon
a
time
merceron
you
know
that
old
victor
here
was
a
bit
smitten
himself
but
he
drugged
my
champagne
yet
so
of
course
as
he
says
it
was
all
a
mistake
after
dinner
the
three
separated
victor
had
to
go
to
a
party
calder
wentworth
proposed
to
charlie
that
they
should
take
a
stroll
together
with
a
view
to
seeing
whether
when
they
came
opposite
to
the
door
of
a
they
would
like
dropping
in
to
see
part
of
the
entertainment
charlie
agreed
and
having
lit
their
cigars
they
set
out
he
found
his
now
friend
amusing
and
calder
for
his
part
took
a
liking
for
charlie
largely
on
account
of
his
good
looks
like
many
plain
people
he
was
extremely
sensitive
to
the
influence
of
beauty
in
women
and
men
alike
i
say
old
fellow
he
said
pressing
charlie
arm
as
if
he
had
known
him
all
his
life
there
was
somebody
in
that
eh
charlie
turned
with
a
smile
and
a
blush
he
felt
confidential
yes
there
was
only
victor
oh
i
know
i
nearly
break
his
head
whenever
he
mentions
any
girl
i
like
you
know
what
he
have
thought
and
it
was
anything
like
that
really
who
was
she
then
i
i
do
know
oh
i
do
mean
her
name
of
course
but
what
was
she
i
do
know
where
did
she
come
from
london
i
believe
oh
i
say
that
a
queer
go
merceron
i
do
know
what
to
think
about
it
she
simply
vanished
said
poor
charlie
and
no
one
should
wonder
if
his
voice
faltered
a
little
calder
wentworth
laughed
at
many
things
but
he
did
not
laugh
now
at
charlie
merceron
indeed
he
looked
unusually
grave
i
should
drop
it
he
remarked
it
do
look
well
healthy
ah
you
never
seen
her
said
charlie
no
and
i
tell
you
what
it
wo
be
a
bad
thing
if
you
do
see
her
again
why
because
you
just
in
the
state
of
mind
to
marry
her
and
why
should
i
wentworth
made
no
answer
and
they
walked
on
till
they
readied
piccadilly
circus
then
charlie
suddenly
darted
forward
hullo
what
up
cried
calder
following
him
charlie
was
talking
eagerly
to
a
very
smart
young
lady
who
had
just
got
down
from
an
omnibus
by
jove
he
ca
have
found
her
thought
calder
it
was
not
the
unknown
but
her
friend
nettie
wallace
whom
quick
eye
had
discerned
and
the
next
moment
willie
prime
made
his
appearance
charlie
received
them
both
almost
with
enthusiasm
and
the
news
from
lang
marsh
was
asked
and
given
calder
drew
near
and
charlie
presented
his
friends
to
one
another
with
the
intent
that
he
might
get
a
word
with
nettie
while
calder
engrossed
her
fiances
attention
have
have
you
heard
from
miss
brown
lately
he
was
just
beginning
when
calder
who
had
been
looking
steadily
at
nettie
burst
out
hullo
i
say
miss
wallace
we
met
before
have
we
you
know
me
do
you
nettie
laughed
oh
yes
i
know
you
sir
you
she
paused
abruptly
and
glanced
from
charlie
to
calder
and
back
from
calder
to
charlie
then
she
blushed
very
red
indeed
well
who
am
i
i
i
saw
you
at
at
miss
glyn
mr
wentworth
you
did
that
it
and
looking
curiously
at
the
flushed
face
he
added
do
be
afraid
to
mention
miss
glyn
merceron
knows
all
about
it
all
about
it
does
he
sir
cried
nettie
well
i
glad
of
that
i
have
been
easy
in
my
mind
ever
since
calder
conformation
of
eye
enabled
him
to
express
much
surprise
by
facial
expression
and
at
this
moment
he
used
his
power
to
the
full
awfully
kind
of
you
miss
wallace
said
he
but
i
do
see
where
your
responsibility
comes
in
ever
since
what
nettie
shot
a
glance
of
inquiry
at
charlie
but
here
too
she
met
only
bewilderment
does
he
know
that
miss
glyn
is
she
began
engaged
to
me
certainly
oh
willie
stood
by
in
silence
he
had
never
heard
of
this
miss
glyn
charlie
puzzled
as
he
was
was
too
intent
on
miss
brown
to
spend
much
time
wondering
why
miss
glyn
affairs
should
have
been
a
trouble
to
nettie
you
let
me
know
if
you
hear
about
her
wo
you
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
nettie
gave
up
the
hope
of
understanding
she
shook
her
head
i
ask
her
if
i
see
her
whether
she
wishes
it
she
whispered
back
and
with
a
hasty
she
seized
willie
arm
and
hurried
him
off
charlie
was
left
alone
with
calder
what
the
deuce
did
she
mean
asked
calder
i
do
know
answered
charlie
where
did
you
meet
her
oh
down
at
home
the
fellow
she
was
with
is
a
son
of
a
tenant
of
ours
she
going
to
marry
him
she
a
nice
little
girl
but
i
hanged
if
i
know
what
she
meant
and
as
the
one
was
thinking
exclusively
of
agatha
glyn
and
the
other
spared
a
thought
for
no
one
but
agatha
brown
they
did
not
arrive
at
an
explanation
one
result
however
that
chance
encounter
had
the
next
morning
miss
agatha
glyn
received
a
letter
in
the
following
terms
madam
i
hope
you
will
excuse
me
intruding
but
i
think
you
would
wish
to
know
that
charles
merceron
is
in
london
and
that
i
met
him
this
evening
with
wentworth
as
you
informed
me
that
you
had
passed
merceron
on
the
road
two
or
three
times
during
your
visit
to
lang
marsh
i
think
you
may
wish
to
be
informed
of
the
above
i
may
add
that
merceron
is
aware
that
you
are
engaged
to
wentworth
but
i
could
not
make
out
how
far
he
was
aware
of
what
happened
at
lang
marsh
i
think
he
does
not
know
it
of
course
you
will
know
whether
wentworth
is
aware
of
your
visit
there
i
should
be
much
obliged
if
you
would
be
so
kind
as
to
tell
me
what
to
say
if
i
meet
the
gentlemen
again
merceron
is
very
pressing
in
asking
me
for
news
of
you
i
am
to
be
married
in
a
fortnight
from
the
present
date
and
i
am
madam
yours
respectfully
nettie
wallace
in
london
and
with
calder
exclaimed
agatha
glyn
oh
dear
oh
dear
oh
dear
what
is
to
be
done
i
wish
i
never
gone
near
the
wretched
place
then
she
took
up
the
letter
and
reread
it
he
and
i
must
meet
that
all
she
said
then
she
slowly
tore
the
letter
into
very
small
pieces
and
put
them
in
the
basket
calder
has
no
idea
where
i
was
she
said
and
she
sat
down
by
the
window
and
looked
out
over
the
park
for
nearly
ten
minutes
ah
well
i
should
like
to
see
him
just
once
again
dear
old
pool
said
she
then
she
suddenly
began
to
laugh
an
action
only
to
be
excused
in
one
in
her
position
and
burdened
with
her
sins
by
the
fact
of
her
having
at
the
moment
a
peculiarly
vivid
vision
of
millie
bushell
going
head
first
out
of
a
canoe
chapter
vii
the
inevitable
meeting
the
first
viscount
thrapston
had
been
an
eminent
public
character
and
the
second
a
respectable
private
person
the
third
had
been
neither
and
yet
there
was
some
good
in
the
third
he
had
loved
his
only
son
with
a
fondness
rare
to
find
and
for
ten
whole
years
while
the
young
man
was
between
seventeen
and
the
old
lord
lived
for
his
sake
a
life
open
to
no
reproach
then
the
son
died
leaving
a
lately
married
wife
and
a
and
lord
thrapston
deprived
at
once
of
hope
and
of
restraint
returned
to
his
old
courses
till
age
came
upon
him
and
drove
him
from
practice
into
reminiscence
glyn
had
outlived
her
husband
fifteen
years
and
then
followed
him
fairly
snubbed
to
death
some
said
by
her
formidable
the
daughter
was
of
sterner
stuff
and
early
discovered
for
herself
that
nothing
worse
than
a
scowl
or
a
snarl
was
to
be
feared
on
her
indeed
descended
a
relic
of
that
tenderness
her
father
had
enjoyed
and
agatha
used
to
the
full
the
advantages
it
gave
her
she
knew
her
own
importance
it
is
not
every
girl
who
will
be
a
peeress
in
her
own
right
and
she
amused
her
grandfather
by
calmly
informing
him
that
it
was
not
on
the
whole
a
subject
for
regret
that
she
had
not
been
a
boy
you
see
said
she
we
get
rid
of
the
new
viscounty
and
it
much
better
to
be
warmley
than
thrapston
the
fact
that
she
was
some
day
to
be
was
the
mainspring
of
that
hairbrained
jaunt
to
lang
marsh
in
company
with
nettie
wallace
nettie
was
the
daughter
of
lord
thrapston
housekeeper
and
the
two
girls
had
been
intimate
in
youth
much
as
charlie
merceron
and
willie
prime
had
been
at
the
court
and
when
nettie
scorning
servitude
set
up
in
life
for
herself
agatha
gave
her
her
custom
and
did
not
withdraw
her
friendship
in
return
she
received
an
allegiance
which
refused
none
of
her
behests
and
a
regard
which
abolished
all
formality
between
them
except
when
nettie
got
a
pen
in
her
hand
and
set
herself
to
compose
a
polite
letter
the
expedition
was
of
course
to
see
the
court
the
old
home
of
the
warmleys
for
which
agatha
felt
a
sentimental
attraction
she
had
told
herself
that
some
day
if
she
were
rich
and
lord
thrapston
not
being
rich
she
must
have
had
some
other
resource
in
her
mind
she
would
buy
back
langbury
court
and
get
rid
of
the
mercerons
altogether
there
were
only
a
widow
and
a
boy
she
had
heard
and
they
should
have
their
price
so
she
went
to
the
court
in
the
mood
of
a
possible
purchaser
calder
could
afford
anything
as
well
as
in
the
romantic
mood
of
a
girl
escaped
from
surroundings
and
plunging
into
a
past
full
of
interest
to
her
had
not
she
also
read
of
agatha
merceron
and
in
this
mixed
mood
she
remained
till
one
evening
at
the
pool
she
had
met
boy
when
the
mood
became
more
mixed
still
she
dared
not
now
look
back
on
the
struggles
she
had
gone
through
before
her
meeting
with
the
boy
became
first
a
daily
event
and
then
the
daily
event
she
had
indulged
herself
for
once
it
was
not
to
last
but
for
once
it
was
overpoweringly
sweet
to
be
gazed
at
by
eyes
that
did
not
remind
her
of
a
frog
and
to
see
swiftly
darting
towards
her
a
lithe
straight
figure
crowned
with
a
head
that
so
she
said
reminded
her
of
lord
byron
but
alas
alas
why
had
nobody
told
her
that
the
boy
was
like
that
before
she
went
why
did
her
grandfather
take
no
care
of
her
why
did
calder
never
show
any
interest
in
what
she
did
why
in
fine
was
everybody
so
cruel
as
to
let
her
do
exactly
what
she
liked
and
thereby
get
into
a
scrape
like
this
one
thing
was
certain
if
that
boy
were
in
london
she
must
avoid
him
they
must
never
meet
it
was
nonsense
for
sigismund
taylor
to
talk
of
making
clean
breast
of
it
of
a
dignified
apology
to
charlie
coupled
with
a
no
less
dignified
intimation
that
their
acquaintance
must
be
regarded
as
closed
taylor
knew
nothing
of
the
world
he
even
wanted
her
to
tell
calder
no
she
was
truly
and
properly
penitent
and
she
hoped
that
she
received
all
he
said
in
that
line
in
a
right
spirit
but
when
it
came
to
a
question
of
expediency
she
would
rather
have
blunt
advice
than
that
of
a
thousand
taylors
so
she
wrote
to
blunt
and
asked
herself
to
lunch
and
blunt
being
an
accomplished
painstaking
hostess
and
having
no
reason
to
suppose
that
her
young
friend
desired
a
confidential
interview
at
once
cast
about
for
some
one
whom
agatha
would
like
to
meet
she
did
not
ask
calder
wentworth
she
was
not
so
commonplace
as
that
but
she
invited
victor
sutton
and
delighting
in
a
happy
flash
of
inspiration
she
added
vansittart
merceron
the
families
were
connected
in
some
way
she
knew
and
agatha
certainly
ought
to
know
merceron
accordingly
when
agatha
arrived
she
found
victor
and
she
had
not
been
there
five
minutes
before
the
butler
throwing
open
the
door
announced
mr
merceron
uncle
van
had
reached
that
state
of
body
when
he
took
his
time
over
stairs
and
between
the
announcement
and
his
entrance
there
was
time
for
agatha
to
exclaim
quite
audibly
oh
what
the
matter
dear
asked
blunt
but
uncle
van
entrance
forbade
a
reply
and
left
agatha
blushing
but
relieved
was
she
never
to
hear
the
end
of
that
awful
story
it
might
be
natural
that
her
hereditary
connection
with
the
mercerons
being
disclosed
vansittart
should
discourse
of
langbury
court
of
the
pool
and
of
agatha
merceron
but
was
it
necessary
that
victor
sutton
should
chime
in
with
the
whole
history
of
the
canoe
and
miss
bushell
or
joke
with
merceron
about
his
nephew
the
whole
topic
seemed
in
bad
taste
and
she
wondered
that
blunt
did
not
discourage
it
but
what
horrible
creatures
men
were
did
they
really
think
it
impossible
for
a
girl
to
like
to
talk
to
a
man
for
an
hour
or
so
in
the
evening
without
you
must
let
me
bring
my
nephew
to
meet
miss
glyn
said
uncle
van
graciously
to
his
hostess
she
is
so
interested
in
the
family
history
that
she
and
charlie
would
get
on
like
wildfire
he
mad
about
it
in
fact
sniggered
victor
miss
glyn
always
detested
that
man
so
interested
that
as
you
hear
he
went
to
meet
agatha
merceron
every
evening
for
a
fortnight
you
be
delighted
to
meet
him
wo
you
agatha
we
must
arrange
a
day
said
blunt
calder
knows
him
added
victor
he
an
idle
young
dog
said
uncle
van
but
a
nice
fellow
a
little
flighty
and
fanciful
as
boys
will
be
but
no
harm
in
him
you
attach
too
much
importance
to
our
chaff
about
his
meetings
at
the
pool
miss
glyn
we
do
mean
any
harm
agatha
tried
to
smile
but
the
attempt
was
not
a
brilliant
success
she
stammered
that
she
would
be
delighted
to
meet
charles
merceron
swearing
in
her
heart
that
she
would
sooner
start
for
tierra
del
fuego
but
her
confession
to
blunt
would
save
her
if
only
these
odious
men
would
go
they
had
had
their
coffee
and
their
liqueurs
and
their
cigarettes
what
more
in
heaven
name
could
even
a
man
want
to
propitiate
the
god
of
his
idolatry
apparently
the
guests
themselves
became
aware
that
they
were
trespassing
for
uncle
van
turning
to
his
hostess
with
his
blandest
smile
remarked
i
hope
we
not
staying
too
long
the
fact
is
my
dear
blunt
you
always
so
kind
that
we
took
the
liberty
of
telling
calder
wentworth
to
call
for
us
here
he
ought
to
have
come
by
now
blunt
declared
that
she
would
be
offended
if
they
thought
of
going
before
calder
came
agatha
rose
in
despair
the
confession
must
be
put
off
she
held
out
her
hand
to
her
hostess
at
this
moment
the
rang
that
him
said
victor
sit
down
again
for
a
minute
dear
urged
blunt
there
was
renewed
hope
for
the
confession
agatha
sat
down
but
hardly
had
she
done
so
before
the
strangest
presentiment
came
over
her
she
heard
the
door
below
open
and
shut
and
it
was
borne
in
upon
her
mind
that
two
men
had
entered
how
she
guessed
it
she
could
not
tell
but
as
she
sat
there
she
had
no
doubt
at
all
that
charlie
merceron
had
come
with
calder
went
worth
escape
was
impossible
but
she
walked
across
to
the
window
and
stood
there
with
her
back
to
the
door
mr
wentworth
she
heard
and
then
cutting
the
servant
short
came
calder
voice
i
took
the
liberty
he
began
and
she
did
not
know
how
he
went
on
for
her
head
was
swimming
agatha
agatha
dear
called
blunt
perforce
she
turned
passing
her
hand
quickly
across
her
brow
yes
it
was
so
there
he
stood
by
calder
side
and
calder
was
saying
my
dear
agatha
this
is
charlie
merceron
she
would
not
look
at
charlie
she
moved
slowly
forward
her
eyes
fixed
on
calder
and
bowed
with
a
little
set
smile
luckily
people
pay
slight
attention
to
one
another
expressions
on
social
occasions
or
they
must
all
have
noticed
her
agitation
as
it
was
only
calder
wentworth
looked
curiously
at
her
before
he
turned
aside
to
shake
hands
with
uncle
van
then
she
felt
charlie
merceron
coining
nearer
and
a
second
later
she
heard
his
voice
is
it
possible
that
it
you
he
asked
in
a
low
tone
then
she
looked
at
him
his
face
was
pale
and
his
eyes
eagerly
straining
to
read
what
might
be
in
hers
hush
she
whispered
yes
hush
hush
but
but
he
told
me
your
name
was
glyn
yes
and
he
says
you
engaged
to
him
agatha
clasped
her
hands
and
calder
voice
broke
in
between
them
come
along
merceron
we
waiting
for
you
they
got
into
antiquities
already
smiled
blunt
you
must
come
again
merceron
and
meet
miss
glyn
must
he
agatha
agatha
threw
one
glance
at
him
if
he
will
she
said
charlie
pulled
himself
together
muttered
something
appropriate
and
shuffled
out
tinder
his
uncle
wing
vansittart
was
surprised
to
find
him
a
trifle
confused
and
awkward
in
society
outside
the
house
charlie
ranged
up
beside
calder
wentworth
leaving
uncle
van
and
sutton
together
well
what
do
you
think
of
her
asked
calder
charlie
gave
no
opinion
he
asked
just
one
question
how
long
have
you
been
engaged
to
her
how
long
oh
let
see
about
yes
just
about
a
year
i
never
knew
that
there
was
a
sort
of
connection
between
you
and
her
sort
of
relationship
you
know
i
ai
strong
on
the
peerage
a
sort
of
connection
there
was
that
in
more
senses
than
the
one
calder
had
been
told
of
by
uncle
van
there
was
a
connection
that
poor
charlie
thought
heaven
itself
had
tied
on
those
summer
evenings
by
the
pool
which
to
strengthen
and
confirm
forever
he
had
sallied
from
his
home
like
a
knight
in
search
of
his
mistress
the
world
over
in
olden
days
and
he
found
her
such
as
this
girl
must
be
stay
he
did
not
know
all
yet
perhaps
she
had
been
forced
into
a
bond
she
hated
he
knew
that
happened
did
not
stories
tell
of
it
and
moralists
declaim
against
it
this
man
this
creature
calder
wentworth
was
buying
her
with
his
money
forcing
himself
on
her
brutally
capturing
her
of
course
how
could
he
have
doubted
her
charlie
dropped
calder
arm
as
though
it
had
been
made
of
iron
hullo
exclaimed
that
worthy
fellow
unconscious
of
offence
charlie
stopped
short
i
ca
come
he
said
i
i
remembered
an
engagement
and
without
more
he
turned
away
and
shot
out
of
sight
round
the
nearest
corner
well
i
hanged
said
calder
wentworth
and
with
a
puzzled
frown
he
joined
his
other
friends
chapter
viii
the
moral
of
it
left
alone
with
blunt
agatha
sank
into
the
nearest
chair
a
very
handsome
young
man
is
he
asked
the
good
lady
pushing
a
chair
back
into
its
place
he
be
an
acquisition
i
think
agatha
made
no
answer
and
blunt
glancing
at
her
found
her
devouring
the
carpet
with
a
stony
stare
what
on
earth
the
matter
child
i
the
wretchedest
wickedest
girl
alive
declared
agatha
good
gracious
blunt
who
do
you
think
was
in
the
when
merceron
went
there
my
dear
are
you
ill
you
jump
about
so
from
subject
to
subject
it
all
one
subject
blunt
there
was
a
girl
there
well
my
dear
and
if
there
was
boys
will
be
boys
and
i
sure
there
was
no
harm
no
harm
oh
agatha
are
you
crazy
demanded
blunt
with
an
access
of
sternness
could
i
fancy
pursued
agatha
in
despairing
playfulness
mimicking
uncle
van
manner
how
miss
bushell
looked
and
how
victor
looked
and
how
everybody
looked
could
i
fancy
it
why
i
was
there
there
where
why
in
that
wretched
little
temple
i
was
the
girl
blunt
i
i
i
was
the
milkmaid
as
sutton
says
i
was
the
country
wench
oh
dear
oh
dear
oh
dear
blunt
knowing
her
sex
held
out
a
bottle
of
salts
i
not
mad
said
agatha
you
nearly
hysterical
agatha
took
a
long
sniff
i
think
i
can
tell
you
now
she
said
more
calmly
but
was
ever
a
girl
in
such
an
awful
position
before
it
is
needless
to
repeat
what
blunt
said
her
censures
will
have
been
long
ago
anticipated
by
every
person
and
if
she
softened
them
down
a
little
more
than
strict
justice
allowed
it
must
have
been
because
agatha
was
an
old
favorite
of
hers
and
lord
thrapston
an
old
antipathy
upon
her
word
she
always
wondered
that
the
poor
child
brought
up
by
that
horrid
old
man
was
not
twice
as
bad
as
she
was
but
what
am
i
to
do
about
them
cried
agatha
evidently
meant
calder
and
charlie
do
why
there
nothing
to
do
you
must
just
apologize
to
merceron
and
tell
him
that
an
end
had
better
be
put
oh
i
know
taylor
said
that
but
blunt
i
do
want
an
end
to
be
put
to
our
acquaintance
i
like
him
very
very
much
oh
and
he
thinks
me
horrid
oh
take
another
sniff
advised
blunt
of
course
if
merceron
is
willing
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
and
just
be
an
acquaintance
oh
but
i
know
he
wo
if
you
knew
charlie
knew
who
agatha
merceron
said
agatha
in
a
very
humble
voice
if
you
knew
him
at
all
you
know
he
would
do
that
then
you
must
send
him
about
his
business
oh
yes
i
know
treated
him
atrociously
but
calder
wentworth
must
be
considered
first
that
is
if
you
care
two
straws
for
the
poor
fellow
which
i
begin
to
doubt
oh
i
do
mrs
blunt
agatha
you
shameless
girl
which
of
these
men
do
talk
as
if
there
were
a
dozen
of
them
dear
blunt
there
are
only
two
one
too
many
yes
i
know
you
you
see
i
i
accustomed
to
calder
oh
are
you
yes
do
be
unkind
blunt
and
then
charlie
was
something
so
new
such
a
charming
change
that
upon
my
word
you
might
be
your
grandfather
talk
about
heredity
and
ibsen
and
all
that
ca
you
help
me
dear
mrs
blunt
i
ca
give
you
two
husbands
if
that
what
you
want
there
child
do
cry
never
mind
me
have
another
sniff
i
shall
go
home
said
agatha
perhaps
grandpapa
may
be
able
to
advise
me
your
grandfather
gracious
goodness
girl
you
never
going
to
tell
him
yes
i
shall
grandpapa
had
a
lot
of
experience
he
says
so
i
should
think
he
had
whispered
blunt
with
uplifted
hands
blunt
you
do
know
how
unhappy
i
am
thanks
yes
a
hansom
please
blunt
are
you
going
to
ask
merceron
here
again
blunt
toleration
was
exhausted
be
off
with
you
she
said
sternly
pointing
a
forefinger
at
the
door
by
great
good
fortune
agatha
found
lord
thrapston
at
home
drawing
a
footstool
beside
his
chair
she
sat
down
her
agitation
was
past
and
she
wore
a
gravely
business
like
air
grandpapa
she
began
i
have
got
something
to
tell
you
go
ahead
my
dear
said
the
old
gentleman
stroking
her
golden
hair
her
father
had
curls
like
that
when
he
was
a
boy
something
dreadful
i
done
you
know
but
you
wo
be
very
angry
will
you
we
see
you
ought
to
be
because
you
not
very
good
yourself
are
you
and
she
first
glanced
up
into
his
old
eyes
and
then
pressed
her
lips
on
his
knotted
lean
old
hand
aggy
said
he
i
expect
you
play
the
deuce
with
the
young
fellows
do
you
agatha
laughed
softly
but
a
frown
succeeded
that
just
it
she
said
now
you
to
listen
and
not
interrupt
or
i
shall
never
be
able
to
manage
it
and
you
not
to
look
at
me
grandpapa
the
narrative
that
tale
began
as
the
comments
of
taylor
and
blunt
were
omitted
those
of
lord
thrapston
may
well
receive
like
treatment
more
especially
as
they
tended
not
to
edification
but
before
his
granddaughter
had
finished
her
story
the
old
man
had
sworn
softly
four
times
and
chuckled
audibly
twice
i
knew
there
was
a
girl
in
that
temple
soon
as
calder
told
me
said
he
but
you
did
know
who
it
was
oh
and
calder
does
not
he
well
you
made
a
pretty
little
fool
of
yourself
missie
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
that
what
you
got
to
tell
me
i
oh
i
dare
say
no
no
you
got
into
the
scrape
and
you
can
get
out
of
it
and
he
suddenly
recollected
his
duties
look
here
agatha
i
must
hang
it
agatha
i
should
be
doing
my
duty
as
as
a
grandfather
if
i
did
say
that
it
a
monstrous
disgraceful
thing
of
you
to
have
done
yes
d
d
disgraceful
and
he
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
with
an
air
of
severe
virtue
yes
dear
but
you
should
swear
should
you
lord
thrapston
felt
that
he
had
spoilt
the
moral
effect
of
his
reproof
and
without
dwelling
further
on
that
aspect
of
the
subject
he
addressed
his
mind
to
the
more
practical
question
the
outcome
different
as
the
source
was
was
the
same
old
verdict
we
must
tell
calder
my
dear
it
is
right
to
keep
him
in
the
dark
i
ca
tell
him
why
must
he
be
told
well
said
lord
thrapston
it
just
possible
aggy
that
he
may
have
something
to
say
to
it
is
it
i
do
mind
what
he
says
declared
agatha
eh
why
i
thought
you
were
so
fond
of
him
so
i
am
and
as
you
going
to
marry
him
i
never
said
i
was
going
to
marry
him
i
only
said
he
might
be
engaged
to
me
if
he
liked
oho
so
this
young
merceron
not
at
all
grandpapa
oh
i
do
wish
somebody
would
help
me
lord
thrapston
rose
from
his
seat
you
must
do
what
you
like
he
said
i
going
to
tell
calder
oh
why
because
he
answered
i
a
man
of
honor
before
the
impressive
invocation
of
her
grandfather
one
religion
agatha
opposition
collapsed
i
suppose
he
must
be
told
she
admitted
mournfully
i
expect
never
speak
to
me
again
and
i
sure
merceron
wo
and
she
sat
on
the
footstool
the
picture
of
dejection
lord
thrapston
was
moved
to
enunciate
a
solemn
truth
aggy
said
he
shaking
his
finger
at
her
in
this
world
you
have
your
fun
for
nothing
but
then
he
spoilt
it
by
adding
regretfully
more
the
pity
and
off
he
hobbled
to
the
club
intent
on
finding
calder
wentworth
for
some
time
after
he
went
agatha
sat
on
her
stool
in
deep
thought
then
she
rose
sat
down
at
the
took
a
pen
and
began
to
bite
the
end
of
it
at
last
she
started
to
write
i
do
know
whether
i
ought
to
write
or
not
but
i
must
tell
you
how
it
happened
oh
do
think
too
badly
of
me
i
came
down
just
because
i
had
heard
so
much
about
the
court
and
i
wanted
to
see
it
and
i
came
as
i
did
with
nettie
wallace
just
for
fun
i
never
meant
to
say
i
was
a
you
know
but
people
would
ask
questions
and
i
had
to
say
something
i
never
never
thought
of
you
i
thought
you
were
about
fifteen
and
you
know
oh
you
must
know
that
i
met
you
quite
by
accident
and
was
just
as
surprised
as
you
were
and
the
rest
was
all
your
fault
i
did
want
to
come
again
you
know
i
refused
ever
so
many
times
and
you
promised
you
would
come
if
i
came
and
then
you
did
come
it
was
really
all
your
fault
and
i
very
very
sorry
and
you
must
please
try
to
forgive
me
dear
merceron
and
not
think
me
a
very
wicked
girl
i
had
no
idea
of
coming
every
evening
but
you
persuaded
me
you
know
you
persuaded
me
and
how
could
i
tell
you
i
was
engaged
you
know
you
never
asked
me
i
would
have
told
you
if
you
had
i
am
telling
wentworth
all
about
it
and
i
do
think
you
ought
to
have
persuaded
me
to
meet
you
as
you
did
it
was
really
kind
or
nice
of
you
was
it
because
of
course
i
not
very
old
and
i
do
know
much
about
the
world
and
i
never
thought
of
all
the
horrid
things
people
would
say
do
please
keep
this
quite
a
secret
i
felt
i
must
write
you
just
a
line
i
wonder
what
you
thinking
about
me
or
whether
you
thinking
about
me
at
all
you
must
never
think
of
me
again
i
am
very
very
unhappy
and
i
do
most
earnestly
hope
dear
merceron
that
i
have
not
made
you
unhappy
we
were
both
very
much
to
blame
were
we
but
we
slipped
into
it
without
knowing
i
do
think
i
shall
ever
forget
the
dear
old
pool
and
the
temple
and
the
rest
but
you
must
please
forget
me
and
forgive
me
i
am
very
miserable
about
it
and
about
everything
i
think
we
had
better
not
know
each
other
any
more
so
please
do
answer
this
just
put
it
in
the
fire
and
think
no
more
about
it
or
me
i
wanted
to
tell
you
all
this
when
i
saw
you
but
i
could
why
did
we
ever
meet
agatha
glyn
she
read
this
rather
confused
composition
over
twice
growing
more
sorry
for
herself
each
time
then
she
put
it
in
an
envelope
addressed
it
to
charlie
looked
out
uncle
van
in
the
directory
and
sent
it
under
cover
to
his
residence
then
she
went
and
lay
down
on
the
and
began
to
cry
and
through
her
tears
she
said
aloud
to
herself
i
wonder
whether
he
write
or
come
because
it
seemed
to
her
entirely
impossible
that
in
spite
of
her
prayer
he
should
put
the
letter
in
the
fire
and
let
her
go
surely
he
too
remembered
the
dear
old
pool
and
the
temple
and
the
rest
chapter
ix
two
men
of
spirit
the
fact
is
observed
lord
thrapston
complacently
the
girl
very
much
resembles
me
in
disposition
calder
eyes
grew
larger
and
rounder
do
you
really
think
so
he
asked
anxiously
well
this
little
lark
of
hers
hang
me
it
just
what
i
should
have
enjoyed
doing
fifty
years
ago
ah
er
lord
thrapston
have
you
noticed
the
resemblance
you
speak
of
in
any
other
way
that
girl
except
that
she
is
a
girl
is
myself
over
again
myself
over
again
the
deuce
i
beg
your
pardon
calder
i
grow
hard
of
hearing
nothing
lord
thrapston
look
here
lord
thrapston
well
well
my
dear
boy
oh
nothing
that
is
but
she
be
all
right
in
your
hands
my
boy
you
must
keep
an
eye
on
her
do
you
know
she
need
a
bit
o
driving
but
i
really
do
see
why
you
should
come
to
grief
i
do
my
soul
no
with
tact
on
your
part
you
might
very
well
pull
through
how
d
mean
tact
lord
thrapston
oh
amuse
her
let
her
travel
give
her
lots
of
society
do
bother
her
with
domestic
affairs
do
let
her
feel
she
under
any
obligation
that
what
she
kicks
against
so
do
i
always
did
calder
pulled
his
mustache
lord
thrapston
had
briefly
sketched
the
exact
opposite
of
his
ideal
of
married
life
the
fact
is
continued
the
old
man
the
boy
an
uncommon
handsome
boy
she
ca
resist
that
no
more
can
i
never
could
there
chanced
to
be
a
mirror
opposite
calder
and
he
impartially
considered
himself
there
was
he
concluded
every
prospect
of
miss
glyn
resisting
any
engrossing
passion
for
him
it
very
good
of
you
to
have
told
me
all
about
it
he
remarked
rising
i
think
it
over
yes
do
of
course
i
admit
she
given
you
a
perfectly
good
reason
for
breaking
off
your
engagement
if
you
like
mind
that
we
do
feel
aggrieved
calder
act
as
you
think
best
we
admit
we
in
the
wrong
but
we
must
stand
by
what
we
done
i
should
like
to
give
her
any
pain
pain
oh
dear
me
no
my
dear
boy
she
wo
fret
make
your
mind
easy
about
that
calder
felt
a
sudden
impulse
to
disclose
to
lord
thrapston
his
secret
opinion
of
him
and
he
recollected
with
a
pang
that
in
the
course
of
so
doing
he
would
have
to
touch
on
more
than
one
characteristic
shared
by
the
old
man
and
agatha
where
were
his
visions
of
a
quiet
home
in
the
country
of
freedom
from
the
irksome
duties
of
society
of
an
obedient
and
devoted
wife
surrounded
by
children
and
flanked
by
jampots
he
had
once
painted
this
picture
for
agatha
shortly
after
she
had
agreed
to
that
arrangement
which
she
declined
to
call
a
promise
of
marriage
and
it
occurred
to
him
now
that
she
had
allowed
the
subject
to
drop
without
any
expression
of
concurrence
he
took
leave
of
lord
thrapston
and
went
for
a
solitary
walk
he
wanted
to
think
but
the
position
of
affairs
was
such
that
other
persons
also
felt
the
need
of
reflection
and
calder
had
not
been
walking
by
the
row
very
long
before
lifting
his
eyes
he
saw
a
young
man
approaching
the
young
man
was
not
attired
as
he
ought
to
have
been
he
wore
a
light
suit
a
dissolute
necktie
and
a
soft
wideawake
crammed
down
low
on
his
head
he
had
obviously
forsworn
the
vanities
of
the
world
and
was
wearing
the
willow
he
came
up
to
calder
and
held
out
his
hand
wentworth
he
said
i
left
you
rudely
the
other
day
i
was
doing
you
an
injustice
i
have
heard
the
truth
from
blunt
you
are
free
from
all
blame
we
we
are
his
tones
were
so
mournful
that
calder
shook
his
hand
with
warm
sympathy
and
remarked
pretty
rough
on
us
both
ai
it
for
me
declared
charlie
everything
is
over
my
trust
in
woman
is
destroyed
my
pleasure
in
life
is
well
i
do
feel
myself
old
chap
said
calder
i
have
written
to
to
her
to
say
no
have
yon
though
what
else
could
i
do
wentworth
do
you
suppose
that
even
if
she
was
free
i
would
think
of
her
for
another
moment
can
there
be
love
where
there
is
no
esteem
no
trust
no
confidence
i
was
just
thinking
that
when
you
came
up
said
calder
no
at
whatever
cost
i
every
man
must
consider
first
of
all
what
he
owes
to
his
name
to
his
family
to
his
wentworth
to
his
unborn
children
calder
nodded
you
of
course
pursued
charlie
will
be
guided
by
your
own
judgment
as
to
that
the
circumstances
seal
my
lips
i
do
like
it
you
know
said
calder
as
regards
you
she
may
or
may
not
have
excuses
i
do
know
but
she
wilfully
and
grossly
deceived
me
i
have
done
with
her
gad
i
believe
you
right
merceron
old
chap
a
chap
ought
to
stand
up
for
himself
by
jove
you
never
feel
safe
with
her
would
you
by
jove
said
charlie
suddenly
i
leave
paddington
by
the
where
are
you
off
to
hell
i
mean
home
answered
charlie
calder
beat
his
stick
against
his
leg
i
ca
stay
here
either
he
said
moodily
charlie
stretched
out
his
hand
again
come
with
me
said
he
eh
what
come
with
me
we
forget
her
together
calder
looked
at
him
well
you
are
a
good
chap
dashed
if
i
do
yes
i
will
we
enjoy
ourselves
like
thunder
but
i
say
merceron
i
i
ought
to
write
to
her
ought
i
i
am
just
going
to
write
myself
to
to
say
eh
yes
i
shall
write
and
break
it
off
come
along
we
go
to
your
rooms
and
got
the
thing
done
and
then
catch
the
train
my
luggage
is
at
the
station
now
it
wo
take
me
a
minute
to
get
mine
wentworth
i
glad
to
be
rid
of
her
all
oh
well
so
am
i
said
calder
late
that
evening
the
butler
presented
miss
agatha
glyn
with
two
letters
on
a
salver
as
her
eye
fell
on
the
addresses
she
started
her
heart
began
to
beat
she
sat
and
looked
at
the
two
momentous
missives
now
which
she
thought
shall
i
read
first
and
what
shall
i
do
if
they
are
both
obstinate
there
was
another
contingency
which
miss
glyn
did
not
contemplate
after
a
long
hesitation
she
took
up
charlie
letter
and
opened
it
it
was
very
short
and
began
abruptly
without
any
words
of
address
i
have
received
your
letter
your
excuses
make
it
worse
i
could
forgive
everything
except
deceit
i
leave
london
c
deceit
cried
agatha
how
dare
he
what
a
horrid
boy
she
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
in
a
state
of
great
indignation
she
had
never
been
talked
to
like
that
in
her
life
before
it
was
ungentlemanly
cruel
brutal
she
flung
charlie
letter
angrily
down
on
the
table
i
am
sure
poor
dear
old
calder
wo
treat
me
like
that
she
exclaimed
taking
up
his
letter
it
ran
thus
my
dear
agatha
i
hope
you
will
believe
that
i
write
this
without
any
feeling
of
anger
towards
you
my
regard
for
you
remains
very
great
and
i
hope
we
shall
always
be
very
good
friends
but
after
long
and
careful
consideration
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
story
lord
thrapston
told
me
shows
conclusively
what
i
have
been
fearing
for
some
time
past
namely
that
i
have
not
been
so
lucky
as
to
win
a
real
affection
from
you
and
that
we
are
not
likely
to
make
one
another
happy
therefore
thanking
you
very
much
for
your
kindness
in
the
past
i
think
i
had
better
restore
your
liberty
to
you
i
shall
hear
with
very
great
pleasure
of
your
happiness
i
leave
town
to
day
for
a
little
while
in
order
that
you
may
not
be
exposed
to
the
awkwardness
of
meeting
me
always
your
most
sincerely
calder
wentworth
agatha
passed
her
hand
across
her
brow
then
she
reread
letter
and
then
charlie
yes
there
was
not
the
least
doubt
about
it
both
of
the
gentlemen
had
well
what
they
had
done
did
not
admit
of
being
put
into
tolerable
words
with
a
little
shriek
agatha
flung
herself
on
the
sofa
the
door
opened
and
lord
thrapston
entered
well
aggy
what
the
news
still
bothered
by
your
two
young
men
hullo
what
wrong
read
them
cried
agatha
with
a
gesture
towards
the
table
eh
head
what
oh
i
see
he
sat
down
at
the
table
and
put
on
his
glasses
agatha
turned
her
face
towards
the
wall
for
her
also
everything
was
over
for
a
time
no
sound
was
audible
save
an
occasional
crackle
of
the
in
lord
thrapston
shaking
fingers
then
to
agatha
indescribable
indignation
there
came
another
sort
of
crackle
a
dry
grating
derisive
chuckle
from
that
old
man
her
grandfather
good
monstrous
good
my
life
said
he
you
laughing
at
me
she
cried
leaping
up
well
my
dear
i
afraid
i
am
oh
how
cruel
men
are
h
they
both
men
of
spirit
evidently
calder
i
can
just
understand
i
perhaps
i
did
treat
calder
rather
badly
oh
you
go
so
far
as
to
admit
that
do
you
aggy
but
charlie
oh
to
think
that
charlie
should
treat
me
like
that
and
she
threw
herself
on
the
sofa
again
lord
thrapston
sat
quite
still
presently
agatha
rose
came
to
the
table
and
took
up
her
two
letters
she
looked
at
them
both
and
the
old
man
seeming
to
notice
nothing
yet
kept
his
eye
on
her
i
shall
destroy
these
things
said
she
and
she
tore
calder
letter
into
tiny
fragments
and
flung
them
on
the
fire
charlie
she
crumpled
up
and
held
in
her
hand
grandpapa
she
said
wearily
and
kissed
him
my
dear
he
answered
and
whatever
she
did
when
she
went
upstairs
lord
thrapston
was
in
a
position
to
swear
that
charlie
letter
was
not
destroyed
in
the
chapter
x
the
incarnation
of
lady
agatha
she
such
a
dear
good
girl
wentworth
said
lady
merceron
she
the
greatest
comfort
i
have
it
was
after
luncheon
at
langbury
court
lady
merceron
and
calder
sat
on
the
lawn
marland
and
millie
bushell
were
walking
up
and
down
charlie
was
lying
in
a
hammock
a
week
had
passed
since
the
two
young
men
had
startled
lady
merceron
by
their
unexpected
arrival
and
since
then
the
good
lady
had
been
doing
her
best
to
entertain
them
for
as
she
could
not
help
they
seemed
a
little
dull
it
was
a
great
change
from
the
whirl
of
london
to
the
deep
placidity
of
the
court
and
lady
merceron
could
not
quite
understand
why
charlie
had
tired
so
soon
of
his
excursion
or
why
his
friend
persisted
with
so
much
fervor
that
anything
was
better
than
london
and
the
court
was
the
most
charming
place
he
had
ever
seen
of
the
two
charlie
seemed
to
feel
the
ennui
much
the
more
severely
yet
while
wentworth
spoke
of
returning
to
town
in
a
few
weeks
charlie
asseverated
that
he
had
paid
his
last
visit
to
that
revolting
and
disappointing
place
lady
merceron
wished
she
had
uncle
van
by
her
side
to
explain
these
puzzling
inconsistencies
however
there
was
a
bright
side
to
the
affair
the
presence
of
the
young
men
was
a
godsend
to
poor
millie
who
by
reason
of
the
depressed
state
of
agriculture
had
been
obliged
this
year
to
go
without
her
usual
six
weeks
of
london
in
the
season
and
she
never
grumbles
about
it
said
lady
merceron
admiringly
she
looks
after
her
district
and
takes
a
ride
and
plays
tennis
when
she
can
get
a
game
poor
girl
and
is
always
cheerful
and
happy
she
be
a
treasure
of
a
wife
to
any
man
you
better
persuade
charlie
of
that
lady
merceron
oh
charlie
never
thinks
of
such
a
thing
as
marrying
he
thinks
of
nothing
but
his
antiquities
does
he
asked
calder
with
apparent
sympathy
and
a
covert
sad
amusement
wentworth
said
marland
approaching
i
believe
actually
a
fact
that
you
been
here
a
week
and
have
never
yet
been
to
the
pool
at
this
fateful
word
calder
looked
embarrassed
charlie
raised
his
head
from
the
hammock
and
millie
glanced
involuntarily
towards
him
we
must
take
you
pursued
marland
this
very
evening
come
miss
bushell
i
do
think
i
care
very
much
about
the
pool
said
millie
we
wo
let
merceron
take
you
in
his
canoe
this
time
charlie
rolled
out
of
the
hammock
and
came
up
to
them
you
must
take
us
to
the
pool
i
do
believe
you
been
there
since
you
came
back
poor
agatha
will
quite
agatha
exclaimed
calder
agatha
merceron
you
know
why
have
you
heard
oh
ah
yes
of
course
i
beg
your
pardon
i
hate
that
beastly
pool
said
charlie
how
can
you
smiled
marland
you
used
to
spend
hours
there
every
evening
charlie
glanced
uneasily
at
calder
who
turned
very
red
times
have
changed
have
they
marland
asked
archly
you
got
tired
of
looking
in
vain
for
agatha
oh
all
right
said
charlie
crossly
we
go
after
tea
anything
seemed
better
than
this
rallying
mood
of
marland
presently
the
two
young
men
went
off
together
to
play
a
game
at
billiards
but
after
half
a
dozen
strokes
charlie
plumped
down
in
a
chair
i
say
calder
old
chap
how
do
you
feel
he
asked
calder
licked
his
cigar
meditatively
better
said
he
at
last
oh
and
you
worse
worse
every
day
i
ca
stand
it
old
chap
i
shall
go
back
what
to
her
yes
that
hardly
sticking
to
our
bargain
you
know
but
hang
it
what
the
good
of
our
both
cutting
her
oh
i
thought
you
did
it
because
you
were
disgusted
with
her
that
was
my
reason
so
it
was
mine
but
probably
she
got
some
other
fellow
by
now
observed
calder
calmly
the
devil
cried
charlie
what
makes
you
think
so
oh
nothing
i
know
her
way
you
see
you
think
she
that
sort
of
girl
good
heavens
well
if
she
was
i
like
to
know
where
you
be
my
friend
i
should
have
the
honor
of
your
acquaintance
charlie
ignored
this
point
and
yet
you
wanted
to
marry
her
i
dare
say
i
was
an
ass
like
better
men
before
me
and
er
since
me
hang
it
cried
charlie
i
sick
of
the
whole
thing
i
sick
of
life
i
sick
of
all
the
nonsense
of
it
for
two
straws
i
have
done
with
it
and
marry
millie
bushell
what
look
here
charlie
calder
left
his
sentence
unfinished
well
said
charlie
if
said
calder
slowly
there
are
any
girls
either
down
here
or
in
london
whom
you
quite
sure
you
never
want
to
marry
i
should
like
to
be
introduced
to
one
of
charlie
if
you
no
objections
what
do
you
mean
why
in
fact
during
this
last
week
charlie
i
have
come
to
have
a
great
esteem
for
miss
bushell
there
about
her
a

stiffly

from

asked
solemnly
in
allowing

fall

where

he
cried
but
calder
dragged
him
off
telling
him
that
would
do
for
bradshaw
at
tea
charlie
spirits
were
very
much
better
and
it
was
observed
that
calder
wentworth
paid
marked
attention
to
millie
bushell
so
that
when
they
started
for
the
pool
millie
was
prevailed
upon
to
be
one
of
the
party
on
the
understanding
that
mr
went
worth
would
take
care
of
her
this
time
the
expedition
went
off
more
quietly
than
it
had
previously
but
at
the
last
moment
the
ladies
declared
that
they
would
be
late
for
dinner
if
they
waited
till
it
was
time
for
agatha
merceron
to
come
oh
nonsense
said
calder
come
over
to
the
temple
miss
bushell
i
wo
upset
the
canoe
well
if
you
insist
said
millie
then
marland
remarked
in
the
quietest
voice
in
the
world
there
some
one
in
the
temple
what
cried
millie
eh
exclaimed
calder
nonsense
said
charlie
i
saw
a
face
at
the
window
insisted
marland
oh
marland
was
it
very
awful
not
at
all
millie
very
pretty
and
she
gave
charlie
a
look
full
of
meaning
look
look
cried
millie
in
strong
agitation
and
as
they
looked
a
slim
figure
in
white
came
quietly
out
of
the
temple
a
smile
and
alas
no
vestige
of
a
blush
on
her
face
walked
composedly
down
the
steps
and
standing
on
the
lowest
one
thence
did
not
throw
herself
into
the
water
but
called
in
the
most
natural
voice
in
the
world
which
of
you
is
coming
to
fetch
me
charlie
looked
at
calder
calder
said
i
think
you
better
put
her
across
old
man
and
er
we
might
as
well
walk
on
they
turned
away
millie
eyes
wide
in
surprise
marland
smiling
the
smile
of
triumphant
sagacity
i
was
coming
to
you
cried
charlie
the
moment
his
canoe
bumped
against
the
stops
what
do
you
mean
sir
by
staying
away
a
whole
week
how
could
you
i
do
know
said
charlie
you
see
i
could
come
till
calder
oh
what
about
calder
he
all
right
what
miss
the
girl
you
upset
out
of
the
canoe
i
think
so
said
charlie
ah
well
said
agatha
but
how
very
curious
then
she
smiled
at
charlie
and
asked
but
what
love
can
there
be
merceron
where
there
is
deceit
charlie
took
no
notice
at
all
of
this
question
do
you
mind
calder
going
he
whispered
well
not
much
said
miss
glyn
thus
it
was
that
the
barony
of
warmley
returned
to
the
house
of
merceron
and
the
portrait
of
the
wicked
lord
came
to
hang
once
more
in
the
so
the
curtain
falls
on
the
comedy
and
what
happened
afterwards
behind
the
scenes
whether
another
comedy
or
a
tragedy
or
a
mixed
sort
of
entertainment
now
grave
now
gay
sometimes
perhaps
delightful
and
again
of
tempered
charm
why
as
to
all
this
what
reck
the
spectators
who
are
crowding
out
of
the
theatre
and
home
to
bed
but
it
seems
as
if
in
spite
of
certain
drawbacks
in
agatha
character
nothing
very
dreadful
can
have
happened
because
and
wentworth
who
are
very
particular
folk
went
to
stay
at
the
court
the
other
day
and
their
only
complaint
was
that
charlie
and
his
bride
were
always
at
the
pool
and
for
his
own
part
if
he
may
be
allowed
a
word
which
some
people
say
he
ought
not
to
be
here
just
at
the
end
the
writer
begs
to
say
that
he
once
knew
agatha
and
he
would
have
taken
the
risks
however
a
lady
to
whom
he
has
shown
this
history
differs
entirely
from
him
and
thinks
that
no
sensible
man
would
have
married
her
but
then
that
is
not
the
question
the
curate
of
poltons
i
must
confess
at
once
that
at
first
at
least
i
very
much
admired
the
curate
i
am
not
referring
to
my
admiration
of
his
fine
figure
six
feet
high
and
straight
as
an
arrow
nor
of
his
handsome
open
ingenuous
countenance
or
his
candid
blue
eye
or
his
thick
curly
hair
no
what
won
my
heart
from
an
early
period
of
my
visit
to
my
cousins
the
poltons
of
poltons
park
was
the
fervent
undisguised
unashamed
confident
and
altogether
manner
in
which
he
made
love
to
miss
beatrice
queenborough
only
daughter
and
heiress
of
the
wealthy
shipowner
sir
wagstaff
queenborough
and
eleanor
his
wife
it
was
purely
the
manner
of
the
curate
advances
that
took
my
fancy
in
the
mere
fact
of
them
there
was
nothing
remarkable
for
all
the
men
in
the
house
and
a
good
many
outside
made
covert
stealthy
and
indirect
steps
in
the
same
direction
for
trix
as
her
friends
called
her
was
if
not
wise
at
least
pretty
and
witty
displaying
to
the
material
eye
a
charming
figure
and
to
the
mental
a
delicate
heartlessness
both
attributes
which
challenge
a
mans
best
efforts
but
then
came
the
fatal
obstacle
from
heiresses
in
reason
a
gentleman
need
neither
shrink
nor
let
himself
be
driven
but
when
it
comes
to
something
like
twenty
thousand
a
year
the
reported
amount
of
trix
dot
he
distrusts
his
own
motives
almost
as
much
as
the
lady
relatives
distrust
them
for
him
we
all
felt
this
stanton
rippleby
and
i
and
although
i
will
not
swear
that
we
spoke
no
tender
words
and
gave
no
meaning
glances
yet
we
reduced
such
concessions
to
natural
weakness
to
a
minimum
not
only
when
lady
queenborough
was
by
but
at
all
times
to
say
truth
we
had
no
desire
to
see
our
scalps
affixed
to
miss
trix
pretty
belt
nor
to
have
our
hearts
broken
like
that
of
the
young
man
in
the
poem
before
she
went
to
homburg
in
the
autumn
with
the
curate
it
was
otherwise
he
jack
ives
by
the
way
was
his
name
appeared
to
rush
not
only
upon
his
fate
but
in
the
face
of
all
possibility
and
of
lady
queenborough
my
cousin
and
hostess
dora
polton
was
very
much
distressed
about
him
she
said
that
he
was
such
a
nice
young
fellow
and
that
it
was
a
great
pity
to
see
him
preparing
such
unhappiness
for
himself
nay
i
happen
to
know
that
she
spoke
very
seriously
to
trix
pointing
out
the
wickedness
of
trifling
with
him
whereupon
trix
who
maintained
a
bowing
acquaintance
with
her
conscience
avoided
him
for
a
whole
afternoon
and
endangered
all
algy
stanton
prudent
resolutions
by
taking
him
out
in
the
canadian
canoe
this
demonstration
in
no
way
perturbed
the
curate
he
observed
that
as
there
was
nothing
better
to
do
we
might
as
well
play
billiards
and
proceeded
to
defeat
me
in
three
games
of
a
hundred
up
no
it
is
quite
immaterial
whether
we
played
for
anything
or
not
after
which
he
told
dora
that
the
vicar
was
taking
the
evening
service
it
happened
to
be
the
day
when
there
was
one
at
the
parish
church
a
piece
of
information
only
relevant
in
so
far
as
it
suggested
that
ives
could
accept
an
invitation
to
dinner
if
one
were
proffered
to
him
dora
very
weakly
rose
to
the
bait
jack
ives
airily
remarking
that
there
was
no
use
in
ceremony
among
friends
seized
the
place
next
to
trix
at
dinner
her
mother
was
just
opposite
and
walked
on
the
terrace
after
dinner
with
her
in
the
moonlight
when
the
ladies
retired
he
came
into
the
drank
a
said
that
miss
queenborough
was
really
a
very
charming
companion
and
apologized
for
leaving
us
early
on
the
ground
that
his
sermon
was
still
unwritten
my
good
cousin
the
squire
suggested
rather
grimly
that
a
discourse
on
the
vanity
of
human
wishes
might
be
appropriate
i
shall
preach
said
ives
thoughtfully
on
the
opportunities
of
wealth
this
resolution
he
carried
out
on
the
next
day
but
one
that
being
a
sunday
i
had
the
pleasure
of
sitting
next
to
miss
trix
and
i
watched
her
with
some
interest
as
ives
developed
his
theme
i
will
not
try
to
reproduce
the
sermon
which
would
have
seemed
by
no
means
a
bad
one
had
any
of
our
party
been
able
to
ignore
the
personal
application
which
we
read
into
it
for
its
main
burden
was
no
other
than
this
that
wealth
should
be
used
by
those
who
were
fortunate
enough
to
possess
it
here
trix
looked
down
and
fidgeted
with
her
as
a
means
of
promoting
greater
union
between
themselves
and
the
less
richly
endowed
and
not
as
alas
had
too
often
been
the
case
as
though
it
were
a
new
barrier
set
up
between
them
and
their
fellow
creatures
here
miss
trix
blushed
slightly
and
had
recourse
to
her
you
said
the
curate
waxing
rhetorical
as
he
addressed
an
imaginary
but
bloated
capitalist
have
no
more
right
to
your
money
than
i
have
it
is
intrusted
to
you
to
be
shared
with
me
at
this
point
i
heard
lady
queenborough
sniff
and
algy
stanton
snigger
i
stole
a
glance
at
trix
and
detected
a
slight
waver
in
the
admirable
lines
of
her
mouth
a
very
good
sermon
did
you
think
i
said
to
her
as
we
walked
home
oh
very
she
replied
demurely
ah
if
we
followed
all
we
heard
in
church
i
sighed
miss
trix
walked
in
silence
for
a
few
yards
by
dint
of
never
becoming
anything
else
we
had
become
very
good
friends
and
presently
she
remarked
quite
confidentially
he
very
silly
is
he
then
you
ought
to
snub
him
said
i
severely
so
i
do
sometimes
he
rather
amusing
though
of
course
if
you
prepared
to
make
the
sacrifice
involved
oh
what
nonsense
then
you
no
business
to
amuse
yourself
with
him
dear
dear
how
moral
you
are
said
trix
the
next
development
in
the
situation
was
this
my
cousin
dora
received
a
letter
from
the
marquis
of
newhaven
with
whom
she
was
acquainted
praying
her
to
allow
him
to
run
down
to
poltons
for
a
few
days
he
reminded
her
that
she
had
once
given
him
a
general
invitation
if
it
would
not
be
inconvenient
and
so
forth
the
meaning
of
this
communication
did
not
of
course
escape
my
cousin
who
had
witnessed
the
writers
attentions
to
trix
in
the
preceding
season
nor
did
it
escape
the
rest
of
us
who
had
talked
over
the
said
attentions
at
the
club
when
she
told
us
about
it
and
announced
that
lord
newhaven
would
arrive
in
the
middle
of
next
day
trix
affected
dense
unconsciousness
her
mother
allowed
herself
a
mysterious
smile
which
however
speedily
vanished
when
the
curate
he
was
taking
lunch
with
us
observed
in
a
cheerful
tone
newhaven
oh
i
remember
the
chap
at
the
house
ploughed
twice
in
smalls
stumpy
fellow
is
he
not
a
bad
chap
though
you
know
barring
his
looks
i
glad
he
coming
you
wo
be
soon
young
man
lady
queenborough
angry
eye
seemed
to
say
i
remember
him
pursued
jack
awfully
smitten
with
a
daughter
in
the
corn
oh
it
all
right
lady
queenborough
she
would
look
at
him
this
was
called
forth
by
the
fact
of
lady
queenborough
pushing
back
her
chair
and
making
for
the
door
it
did
not
at
all
appease
her
to
hear
of
the
scorn
of
the
tobacconist
daughter
she
glared
sternly
at
jack
and
disappeared
he
turned
to
trix
and
reminded
her
without
diffidence
and
coram
populo
as
his
habit
was
that
she
had
promised
him
a
stroll
in
the
west
wood
what
happened
on
that
stroll
i
do
not
know
but
meeting
miss
trix
on
the
stairs
later
in
the
afternoon
i
ventured
to
remark
i
hope
you
broke
it
to
him
gently
miss
queenborough
i
do
know
what
you
mean
replied
trix
haughtily
you
were
out
nearly
two
hours
said
i
were
we
asked
trix
with
a
start
good
gracious
where
was
mamma
mr
wynne
on
the
lawn
watch
in
hand
miss
trix
went
slowly
upstairs
and
there
is
not
the
least
doubt
that
something
serious
passed
between
her
and
her
mother
for
both
of
them
were
in
the
most
atrocious
of
humors
that
evening
fortunately
the
curate
was
not
there
he
had
a
bible
class
the
next
day
lord
newhaven
arrived
i
found
him
on
the
lawn
when
i
strolled
up
after
a
spell
of
about
four
was
the
order
of
the
day
and
we
were
all
in
flannels
oh
here
mark
cried
dora
seeing
me
now
mark
you
and
ives
had
better
play
against
trix
and
lord
newhaven
that
make
a
very
good
set
no
no
polton
said
jack
ives
they
would
have
a
chance
look
here
i
play
with
miss
queenborough
against
lord
newhaven
and
wynne
newhaven
whose
appearance
by
the
way
though
hardly
distinguished
was
not
quite
so
unornamental
as
the
curate
had
led
us
to
expect
looked
slightly
displeased
but
jack
gave
him
no
time
for
remonstrance
he
whisked
trix
off
and
began
to
serve
all
in
a
moment
i
had
a
vision
of
lady
queenborough
approaching
from
the
house
with
face
aghast
the
set
went
on
and
owing
entirely
to
newhaven
absurd
chivalry
in
sending
all
the
balls
to
jack
ives
instead
of
following
the
maxim
to
pound
away
at
the
lady
they
beat
us
jack
wiped
his
brow
strolled
up
to
the
with
trix
and
remarked
in
exultant
tones
we
make
a
perfect
couple
miss
queenborough
we
ought
never
to
be
separated
dora
did
not
ask
the
curate
to
dinner
that
night
but
he
dropped
in
about
nine
to
ask
her
opinion
as
to
the
hymns
on
sunday
and
finding
miss
trix
and
newhaven
in
the
small
he
sat
down
and
talked
to
them
this
was
too
much
for
trix
she
had
treated
him
very
kindly
and
had
allowed
him
to
amuse
her
but
it
was
impossible
to
put
up
with
presumption
of
that
kind
difficult
as
it
was
to
discourage
ives
she
did
it
and
he
went
away
with
a
disconsolate
puzzled
expression
at
the
last
moment
however
trix
so
far
relented
as
to
express
a
hope
that
he
was
coming
to
tennis
at
which
he
brightened
up
a
little
i
do
not
wish
to
be
uncharitable
least
of
all
to
a
charming
young
lady
but
my
opinion
is
that
miss
trix
did
not
wish
to
set
the
curate
altogether
adrift
i
think
however
that
lady
queenborough
must
have
spoken
again
for
when
jack
did
come
to
tennis
trix
treated
him
with
the
most
freezing
civility
and
a
hardly
disguised
disdain
and
devoted
herself
to
lord
newhaven
with
as
much
assiduity
as
her
mother
could
wish
we
men
over
our
pipes
expressed
the
opinion
that
jack
ives
little
hour
of
sunshine
was
passed
and
that
nothing
was
left
to
us
but
to
look
on
at
the
prosperous
uneventful
course
of
lord
newhaven
wooing
trix
had
had
her
fun
so
algy
stanton
bluntly
phrased
it
and
would
now
settle
down
to
business
i
believe
though
he
added
that
she
likes
the
curate
a
bit
you
know
during
the
whole
of
the
next
day
wednesday
jack
ives
kept
away
he
had
apparently
accepted
the
inevitable
and
was
healing
his
wounded
heart
by
a
strict
attention
to
his
parochial
duties
newhaven
remarked
on
his
absence
with
an
air
of
relief
and
miss
trix
treated
it
as
a
matter
of
no
importance
lady
queenborough
was
all
smiles
and
dora
polton
restricted
herself
to
exclaiming
as
i
sat
by
her
at
tea
in
a
low
tone
and
√†
propos
of
nothing
in
particular
oh
well
poor
mr
ives
but
on
thursday
there
occurred
an
event
the
significance
of
which
passed
at
the
moment
unperceived
but
which
had
in
fact
most
important
results
this
was
no
other
than
the
arrival
of
little
wentworth
an
intimate
friend
of
dora
wentworth
had
been
left
a
widow
early
in
life
she
possessed
a
comfortable
competence
she
was
not
handsome
but
she
was
vivacious
amusing
and
above
all
sympathetic
she
sympathized
at
once
with
lady
queenborough
in
her
maternal
anxieties
with
trix
on
her
charming
romance
with
newhaven
on
his
sweet
devotedness
with
the
rest
of
us
in
our
obvious
desolation
and
after
a
confidential
chat
with
dora
she
sympathized
most
strongly
with
poor
ives
on
his
unfortunate
attachment
nothing
would
satisfy
her
so
dora
told
me
except
the
opportunity
of
plying
ives
with
her
soothing
balm
and
dora
was
about
to
sit
down
and
write
him
a
note
when
he
strolled
in
through
the
window
and
announced
that
his
cooks
mother
was
ill
and
that
he
should
be
very
much
obliged
if
polton
would
give
him
some
dinner
that
evening
trix
and
newhaven
happened
to
enter
by
the
door
at
the
same
moment
and
jack
darted
up
to
them
and
shook
hands
with
the
greatest
effusion
he
had
evidently
buried
all
unkindness
and
with
it
we
hoped
his
mistaken
folly
however
that
might
be
he
made
no
effort
to
engross
trix
but
took
his
seat
most
docilely
by
his
hostess
and
she
of
course
introduced
him
to
wentworth
his
behavior
was
in
fact
so
exemplary
that
even
lady
queenborough
relaxed
her
severity
and
condescended
to
him
on
the
morals
and
manners
of
the
old
women
of
the
parish
oh
the
vicar
looks
after
them
said
jack
and
he
turned
to
wentworth
again
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
wentworth
had
a
remarkable
power
of
sympathy
i
took
her
into
dinner
and
she
was
deep
in
the
subject
of
my
noble
and
inspiring
art
before
the
soup
was
off
the
table
indeed
i
sure
that
my
life
ambitions
would
have
been
an
open
book
to
her
by
the
time
that
the
joint
arrived
had
not
jack
ives
who
was
sitting
on
the
lady
other
side
cut
into
the
conversation
just
as
wentworth
was
comparing
my
early
struggles
with
those
of
carlyle
after
this
intervention
of
jack
i
had
not
a
chance
i
ate
my
dinner
without
the
sauce
of
sympathy
substituting
for
it
a
certain
amusement
which
i
derived
from
studying
the
face
of
miss
trix
queenborough
who
was
placed
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
and
if
trix
did
look
now
and
again
at
wentworth
and
jack
ives
i
can
not
say
that
her
conduct
was
unnatural
to
tell
the
truth
jack
was
so
obviously
delighted
with
his
new
friend
that
it
was
quite
pleasant
and
as
i
say
under
the
circumstances
rather
amusing
to
watch
them
we
felt
that
the
squire
was
justified
in
having
a
hit
at
jack
when
jack
said
in
the
that
he
found
himself
rather
at
a
loss
for
a
subject
for
his
next
sermon
what
do
you
say
suggested
my
cousin
puffing
at
his
pipe
to
taking
constancy
as
your
text
jack
considered
the
idea
for
a
moment
but
then
he
shook
his
head
no
i
think
he
said
reflectively
that
i
shall
preach
on
the
power
of
sympathy
that
sermon
afforded
me
i
must
confess
it
at
the
risk
of
seeming
frivolous
very
great
entertainment
again
i
secured
a
place
by
miss
trix
on
her
left
newhaven
being
on
her
right
and
her
face
was
worth
study
when
jack
ives
gave
us
a
most
eloquent
description
of
the
wonderful
gift
in
question
it
was
he
said
the
essence
and
the
crown
of
true
womanliness
and
it
showed
itself
well
to
put
it
quite
plainly
it
showed
itself
according
to
jack
ives
in
exactly
that
sort
of
manner
and
bearing
which
so
honorably
and
gracefully
distinguished
wentworth
the
lady
was
not
of
course
named
but
she
was
clearly
indicated
your
gift
your
precious
gift
cried
the
curate
apostrophizing
the
impersonation
of
sympathy
is
given
to
you
not
for
your
profit
but
for
mine
it
is
yours
but
it
is
a
trust
to
be
used
for
me
it
is
yours
in
fact
to
share
with
me
at
this
climax
which
must
have
struck
upon
her
ear
with
a
certain
familiarity
miss
trix
queenborough
notwithstanding
the
place
and
occasion
tossed
her
pretty
head
and
whispered
to
me
what
horrid
stuff
in
the
ensuing
week
jack
ives
was
our
constant
companion
the
continued
illness
of
his
servant
mother
left
him
stranded
and
dora
kind
heart
at
once
offered
him
the
hospitality
of
her
roof
for
my
part
i
was
glad
for
the
little
drama
which
now
began
was
not
without
its
interest
it
was
a
pleasant
change
to
see
jack
genially
polite
to
trix
queenborough
but
quite
indifferent
to
her
presence
or
absence
and
content
to
allow
her
to
take
newhaven
for
her
partner
at
tennis
as
often
as
she
pleased
he
himself
was
often
an
absentee
from
our
games
wentworth
did
not
play
and
jack
would
sit
under
the
trees
with
her
or
take
her
out
in
the
canoe
what
trix
thought
i
did
not
know
but
it
is
a
fact
that
she
treated
poor
newhaven
like
dirt
beneath
her
feet
and
that
lady
queenborough
face
began
to
lose
its
transiently
pleasant
expression
i
had
a
vague
idea
that
a
retribution
was
working
itself
out
and
disposed
myself
to
see
the
process
with
all
the
complacency
induced
by
the
spectacle
of
others
receiving
punishment
for
their
sins
a
little
scene
which
occurred
after
lunch
one
day
was
significant
i
was
sitting
on
the
terrace
ready
booted
and
breeched
waiting
for
my
horse
to
be
brought
round
trix
came
out
and
sat
down
by
me
where
newhaven
i
asked
oh
i
do
always
want
lord
newhaven
she
exclaimed
petulantly
i
sent
him
off
for
a
walk
i
going
out
in
the
canadian
canoe
with
mr
ives
oh
you
are
are
you
said
i
smiling
as
i
spoke
jack
ives
ran
up
to
us
i
say
miss
queenborough
he
cried
i
just
got
your
message
saying
you
let
me
take
you
on
the
lake
is
it
a
great
bore
asked
trix
with
a
glance
a
glance
that
meant
mischief
i
should
like
it
awfully
of
course
said
jack
but
the
fact
is
promised
to
take
wentworth
before
i
got
your
message
you
know
trix
drew
herself
up
of
course
if
wentworth
she
began
i
very
sorry
said
jack
then
miss
queenborough
forgetting
as
i
hope
or
choosing
to
disregard
my
presence
leant
forward
and
asked
in
her
most
coaxing
tones
do
you
ever
forget
a
promise
mr
ives
jack
looked
at
her
i
suppose
her
dainty
prettiness
struck
him
afresh
for
he
wavered
and
hesitated
she
gone
upstairs
pursued
the
tempter
and
we
shall
be
safe
away
before
she
comes
down
again
jack
shuffled
with
one
foot
on
the
gravel
i
tell
you
what
he
said
i
ask
her
if
she
minds
me
taking
you
for
a
little
while
before
i
i
believe
he
really
thought
that
he
had
hit
upon
a
compromise
satisfactory
to
all
parties
if
so
lie
was
speedily
undeceived
trix
flushed
rod
and
answered
angrily
pray
do
trouble
i
do
want
to
go
perhaps
afterwards
you
might
suggested
the
curate
but
now
rather
timidly
i
going
out
with
lord
newhaven
said
she
and
she
added
in
an
access
of
uncontrollable
annoyance
go
please
go
i
i
do
want
you
jack
sheered
off
with
a
look
of
puzzled
shamefacedness
he
disappeared
into
the
house
nothing
passed
between
miss
trix
and
myself
a
moment
later
newhaven
came
out
why
miss
queenborough
said
he
in
apparent
surprise
ives
is
going
with
wentworth
in
the
canoe
in
an
instant
i
saw
what
she
had
done
in
rash
presumption
she
had
told
newhaven
that
she
was
going
with
the
curate
and
now
the
curate
had
refused
to
take
her
and
ives
had
met
him
in
search
of
wentworth
what
could
she
do
well
she
rose
or
fell
to
the
occasion
in
the
coldest
of
voices
she
said
i
thought
you
gone
for
your
walk
i
was
just
starting
he
answered
apologetically
when
i
met
ives
but
as
you
were
going
with
him
he
paused
an
inquiring
look
in
his
eyes
he
was
evidently
asking
himself
why
she
had
not
gone
with
the
curate
i
rather
be
left
alone
if
you
do
mind
said
she
and
then
flushing
red
again
she
added
i
changed
my
mind
and
refused
to
go
with
ives
so
he
went
off
to
get
wentworth
instead
i
started
newhaven
looked
at
her
for
an
instant
and
then
turned
on
his
heel
she
turned
to
me
quick
as
lightning
and
with
her
face
all
aflame
if
you
tell
i
never
speak
to
you
again
she
whispered
after
this
there
was
silence
for
some
minutes
well
she
said
without
looking
at
me
i
have
no
remark
to
offer
miss
queenborough
i
returned
i
suppose
that
was
a
lie
was
it
she
asked
defiantly
it
not
my
business
to
say
what
it
was
was
my
discreet
answer
i
know
what
you
thinking
i
was
said
i
which
i
would
rather
be
the
man
you
will
marry
or
the
man
you
would
like
how
dare
you
it
not
true
oh
wynne
indeed
it
not
true
whether
it
were
true
or
not
i
did
not
know
but
if
it
had
been
miss
trix
queenborough
might
have
been
expected
to
act
very
much
in
the
way
in
which
she
proceeded
to
act
that
is
to
say
to
be
extravagantly
attentive
to
lord
newhaven
when
jack
ives
was
present
and
markedly
neglectful
of
him
in
the
curate
absence
it
also
fitted
in
very
well
with
the
theory
which
i
had
ventured
to
hint
that
her
bearing
towards
mrs
went
worth
was
distinguished
by
a
stately
civility
and
her
remarks
about
that
lady
by
a
superfluity
of
laudation
for
if
these
be
not
two
distinguishing
marks
of
rivalry
in
the
i
must
go
back
to
my
favorite
books
and
learn
from
them
more
folly
and
if
trix
manners
were
all
that
they
should
be
praise
no
less
high
must
be
accorded
to
wentworth
she
attained
an
altitude
of
admirable
unconsciousness
and
conducted
her
flirtation
the
poverty
of
language
forces
me
to
the
word
but
it
is
over
flippant
with
the
curate
in
a
staid
way
she
called
him
a
delightful
boy
and
said
that
she
was
intensely
interested
in
all
his
aims
and
hopes
what
does
she
want
i
asked
dora
despairingly
she
ca
want
to
marry
him
i
was
referring
to
trix
queenborough
not
to
wentworth
good
gracious
no
answered
dora
irritably
it
simple
jealousy
she
wo
let
the
poor
boy
alone
till
he
in
love
with
her
again
it
a
horrible
shame
oh
well
he
has
great
recuperative
power
said
i
she
better
be
careful
though
it
a
very
dangerous
game
how
do
you
suppose
lord
newhaven
likes
it
accident
gave
me
that
very
day
a
hint
how
little
lord
newhaven
liked
it
and
a
glimpse
of
the
risk
miss
trix
was
running
entering
the
library
suddenly
i
heard
newhaven
voice
raised
above
his
ordinary
tones
i
wo
stand
it
he
was
declaring
i
never
know
how
she
treat
me
from
one
minute
to
the
next
my
entrance
of
course
stopped
the
conversation
very
abruptly
newhaven
had
come
to
a
stand
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
lady
queenborough
sat
on
the
sofa
a
formidable
frown
on
her
brow
withdrawing
myself
as
rapidly
as
possible
i
argued
the
probability
of
a
severe
lecture
for
miss
trix
ending
in
a
command
to
try
her
noble
suitor
patience
no
longer
i
hope
all
this
happened
for
i
not
seeing
why
wentworth
should
monopolize
the
grace
of
sympathy
took
the
liberty
of
extending
mine
to
newhaven
he
was
certainly
in
love
with
trix
not
with
her
money
and
the
treatment
he
underwent
must
have
been
as
trying
to
his
feelings
as
it
was
galling
to
his
pride
my
sympathy
was
not
premature
for
miss
trix
fascinations
which
were
indubitably
great
began
to
have
their
effect
the
scene
about
the
canoe
was
but
with
a
different
denouement
this
time
the
promise
was
forgotten
and
the
widow
forsaken
then
wentworth
put
on
her
armor
we
had
in
fact
reached
this
very
absurd
situation
that
these
two
ladies
were
contending
for
the
favors
of
or
the
domination
over
such
an
obscure
hopelessly
ineligible
person
as
the
curate
of
poltons
undoubtedly
was
the
position
seemed
to
me
then
and
still
seems
to
indicate
some
remarkable
qualities
in
that
young
man
at
last
newhaven
made
a
move
at
breakfast
on
wednesday
morning
he
announced
that
reluctant
as
he
should
be
to
leave
poltons
park
he
was
due
at
his
aunt
place
in
kent
on
saturday
evening
and
must
therefore
make
his
arrangements
to
leave
by
noon
on
that
day
the
significance
was
apparent
had
he
come
down
to
breakfast
with
now
or
never
stamped
in
fiery
letters
across
his
brow
it
would
have
been
more
obtrusive
indeed
but
not
a
whit
plainer
we
all
looked
down
at
our
plates
except
jack
ives
he
flung
one
glance
i
saw
it
out
of
the
corner
of
my
left
eye
at
newhaven
another
at
trix
then
he
remarked
kindly
we
shall
be
uncommonly
sorry
to
lose
you
newhaven
events
began
to
happen
now
and
i
will
tell
them
as
well
as
i
am
able
supplementing
my
own
knowledge
by
what
i
learnt
afterwards
from
dora
she
having
learnt
it
from
the
actors
in
the
scene
in
spite
of
the
solemn
warning
conveyed
in
newhaven
intimation
trix
greatly
daring
went
off
immediately
after
lunch
for
what
she
described
as
long
ramble
with
ives
there
was
indeed
the
excuse
of
an
old
woman
at
the
end
of
the
ramble
and
trix
provided
jack
with
a
small
basket
of
comforts
for
the
useful
old
body
but
the
ramble
was
we
felt
the
thing
and
i
was
much
annoyed
at
not
being
able
to
accompany
the
walkers
in
the
cloak
of
darkness
or
other
invisible
contrivance
the
ramble
consumed
three
hours
full
measure
indeed
it
was
six
before
trix
alone
walked
up
the
drive
newhaven
a
solitary
figure
paced
up
and
down
the
terrace
fronting
the
drive
trix
came
on
her
head
thrown
back
and
a
steady
smile
on
her
lips
she
saw
newhaven
he
stood
looking
at
her
for
a
moment
with
what
she
afterwards
described
as
an
indescribable
smile
on
his
face
but
not
as
dora
understood
from
her
by
any
means
a
pleasant
one
yet
if
not
pleasant
there
is
not
the
least
doubt
in
the
world
that
it
was
highly
significant
for
she
cried
out
nervously
why
are
you
looking
at
me
like
that
what
the
matter
newhaven
still
saying
nothing
turned
his
back
on
her
and
made
as
if
he
would
walk
into
the
house
and
leave
her
there
ignored
discarded
done
with
she
realizing
the
crisis
which
had
come
forgetting
everything
except
the
imminent
danger
of
losing
him
once
for
all
without
time
for
long
explanation
or
any
round
about
seductions
ran
forward
laying
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
blurting
out
but
i
refused
him
i
do
not
know
what
newhaven
thinks
now
but
i
sometimes
doubt
whether
he
would
not
have
been
wiser
to
shake
off
the
detaining
hand
and
pursue
his
lonely
way
first
into
the
house
and
ultimately
to
his
aunt
but
to
say
nothing
of
the
twenty
thousand
a
year
which
after
all
and
lie
you
as
romantic
as
you
may
please
to
be
is
not
a
thing
to
be
sneezed
at
trix
face
its
mingled
eagerness
and
shame
its
flushed
cheeks
and
shining
eyes
the
piquancy
of
its
unwonted
humility
overcame
him
he
stopped
dead
i
i
was
obliged
to
give
him
an
an
opportunity
said
miss
trix
having
the
grace
to
stumble
a
little
in
her
speech
and
and
it
all
your
fault
the
war
was
thus
by
happy
audacity
carried
into
newhaven
own
quarters
my
fault
he
exclaimed
my
fault
that
you
walk
all
day
with
that
curate
then
miss
trix
and
let
no
irrelevant
considerations
mar
the
appreciation
of
line
acting
dropped
her
eyes
and
murmured
softly
i
i
was
so
terribly
afraid
of
seeming
to
expect
you
wherewith
she
and
not
he
ran
away
lightly
up
the
stairs
turning
just
one
glance
downwards
as
she
reached
the
landing
newhaven
was
looking
up
from
below
with
an
smile
the
word
is
own
i
should
probably
have
used
a
different
one
was
then
the
curate
of
poltons
utterly
defeated
brought
to
his
knees
only
to
lie
spurned
it
seemed
so
and
he
came
down
to
dinner
that
night
with
a
subdued
and
melancholy
expression
trix
on
the
other
hand
was
brilliant
and
talkative
to
the
last
degree
and
the
gayety
spread
from
her
all
round
the
table
leaving
untouched
only
the
rejected
lover
and
wentworth
for
the
lady
true
to
her
distinguishing
quality
had
begun
to
talk
to
poor
jack
ives
in
low
soothing
tones
after
dinner
trix
was
not
visible
but
the
door
of
the
little
boudoir
beyond
stood
and
very
soon
newhaven
edged
his
way
through
almost
at
the
same
moment
jack
ives
and
wentworth
passed
out
of
the
window
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
gravel
nobody
but
myself
appeared
to
notice
these
remarkable
occurrences
but
i
watched
them
with
keen
interest
half
an
hour
passed
and
then
there
smote
on
my
watchful
ear
the
sound
of
a
low
laugh
from
the
boudoir
it
was
followed
almost
immediately
by
a
stranger
sound
from
the
gravel
walk
then
all
in
a
moment
two
things
happened
the
boudoir
door
opened
and
trix
followed
by
newhaven
came
in
smiling
from
the
window
entered
jack
ives
and
wentworth
my
eyes
were
on
the
curate
he
gave
one
sudden
comprehending
glance
towards
the
other
couple
then
he
took
the
widows
hand
led
her
up
to
dora
and
said
in
low
yet
penetrating
tones
will
you
wish
us
joy
mrs
polton
the
squire
rippleby
and
algy
stanton
were
round
them
in
an
instant
i
kept
my
place
watching
now
the
face
of
trix
queenborough
she
turned
first
flaming
red
then
very
pale
i
saw
her
turn
to
newhaven
and
speak
one
or
two
urgent
imperative
words
to
him
then
drawing
herself
up
to
her
full
height
she
crossed
the
room
to
where
the
group
was
assembled
round
wentworth
and
jack
ives
what
the
matter
what
are
you
saying
she
asked
wentworth
eyes
were
modestly
cast
down
but
a
smile
played
round
her
mouth
no
one
spoke
for
a
moment
then
jack
ives
said
wentworth
has
promised
to
be
my
wife
miss
queenborough
for
a
moment
hardly
perceptible
trix
hesitated
then
with
the
most
winning
touching
sweetest
smile
in
the
world
she
said
so
you
took
my
advice
and
our
afternoon
walk
was
not
wasted
after
all
polton
is
not
used
to
these
fine
flights
of
diplomacy
she
had
heard
before
dinner
something
of
what
had
actually
happened
in
the
afternoon
and
the
simple
woman
positively
jumped
jack
ives
met
scornful
eyes
full
and
square
not
at
all
wasted
said
he
with
a
smile
not
only
has
it
shown
me
where
my
true
happiness
lies
but
it
has
also
given
me
a
juster
idea
of
the
value
and
sincerity
of
your
regard
for
me
miss
queenborough
it
is
as
real
ives
as
it
is
sincere
said
she
it
is
like
yourself
miss
queenborough
said
he
with
a
little
bow
and
he
turned
from
her
and
began
to
talk
to
his
fianc√©e
trix
queenborough
moved
slowly
towards
where
i
sat
newhaven
was
watching
her
from
where
he
stood
alone
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
have
you
no
news
for
us
i
asked
in
low
tones
thank
you
she
said
haughtily
i
do
care
that
mine
should
be
a
pendant
to
the
great
tidings
about
the
little
widow
and
the
curate
after
a
moment
pause
she
went
on
he
lost
no
time
did
he
he
was
wise
to
secure
her
before
what
happened
this
afternoon
could
leak
out
nobody
can
tell
her
now
this
afternoon
he
asked
me
to
marry
him
this
afternoon
and
you
refused
yes
well
his
behavior
is
in
outrageously
bad
taste
but
she
laid
a
hand
on
my
arm
and
said
in
calm
level
tones
i
refused
him
because
i
dared
not
have
him
but
i
told
him
i
cared
for
him
and
he
said
he
loved
me
and
i
let
him
kiss
me
mr
wynne
i
sat
still
and
silent
newhaven
came
across
to
us
trix
put
out
her
hand
and
caught
him
by
the
sleeve
fred
she
said
my
dear
honest
old
fred
you
love
me
do
you
newhaven
much
embarrassed
and
surprised
looked
at
me
in
alarm
but
her
hand
was
in
his
now
and
her
eyes
imploring
him
i
should
rather
think
i
did
my
dear
said
he
i
really
hope
that
lord
and
lady
newhaven
will
not
be
very
unhappy
while
ives
quite
worships
her
husband
and
is
convinced
that
she
eclipsed
the
brilliant
and
wealthy
miss
queenborough
perhaps
she
did
perhaps
not
there
are
as
i
have
said
great
qualities
in
the
curate
of
poltons
but
i
have
not
quite
made
up
my
mind
precisely
what
they
are
i
ought
however
to
say
that
dora
takes
a
more
favorable
view
of
him
and
a
less
lenient
view
of
trix
than
i
that
is
perhaps
natural
besides
dora
does
not
know
the
precise
manner
in
which
the
curate
was
refused
by
the
way
he
preached
next
sunday
on
the
text
the
children
of
this
world
are
wiser
in
their
generation
than
the
children
of
light
a
novel
it
was
i
believe
mainly
as
a
compliment
to
me
that
miss
audrey
liston
was
asked
to
poltons
miss
liston
and
i
were
very
good
friends
and
my
cousin
dora
polton
thought
as
she
informed
me
that
it
would
be
nice
for
me
to
have
someone
i
could
talk
to
about
books
and
so
on
i
did
not
complain
miss
liston
was
a
pleasant
young
woman
of
i
liked
her
very
much
except
on
paper
and
i
was
aware
that
she
made
it
a
point
of
duty
to
read
something
at
least
of
what
i
wrote
she
was
in
the
habit
of
describing
herself
as
an
authoress
in
a
small
way
if
it
were
pointed
out
that
six
novels
in
three
years
the
term
of
her
literary
activity
at
the
time
of
which
i
write
could
hardly
be
called
a
small
way
she
would
smile
modestly
and
say
that
it
was
not
really
much
and
if
she
were
told
that
the
english
language
embraced
no
such
word
as
authoress
she
would
smile
again
and
say
that
it
ought
to
a
position
towards
the
bugbear
of
correctness
with
which
i
confess
i
sympathize
in
some
degree
she
was
very
diligent
she
worked
from
ten
to
one
every
day
while
she
was
at
poltons
how
much
she
wrote
is
between
her
and
her
conscience
there
was
another
impeachment
which
miss
liston
was
hardly
at
the
trouble
to
deny
take
my
characters
from
life
she
would
exclaim
surely
every
artist
miss
liston
often
referred
to
herself
as
an
artist
must
and
she
would
proceed
to
maintain
what
is
perhaps
true
sometimes
that
people
rather
liked
being
put
into
books
just
as
they
liked
being
photographed
for
all
that
they
grumble
and
pretend
to
be
afflicted
when
either
process
is
levied
against
them
in
discussing
this
matter
with
miss
liston
i
felt
myself
on
delicate
ground
for
it
was
notorious
that
i
figured
in
her
first
book
in
the
guise
of
a
misogynistic
genius
the
fact
that
she
lengthened
and
thickened
my
hair
converted
it
from
an
indeterminate
brown
to
a
dusty
black
gave
me
a
drooping
mustache
and
invested
my
very
ordinary
eyes
with
a
strange
magnetic
attraction
availed
nothing
i
was
at
once
recognized
and
i
may
remark
in
passing
an
uncommonly
disagreeable
fellow
she
made
me
thus
i
had
passed
through
the
fire
i
felt
tolerably
sure
that
i
presented
no
other
aspect
of
interest
real
or
supposed
and
i
was
quite
content
that
miss
liston
should
serve
all
the
rest
of
her
acquaintance
as
she
had
served
me
i
reckoned
they
would
last
her
at
the
present
rate
of
production
about
five
years
fate
was
kind
to
miss
liston
and
provided
her
with
most
suitable
patterns
for
her
next
piece
of
work
at
poltons
itself
there
were
a
young
man
and
a
young
woman
staying
in
the
house
sir
gilbert
chillington
and
miss
pamela
myles
the
moment
miss
liston
was
appraised
of
a
possible
romance
she
began
the
study
of
the
protagonists
she
was
looking
out
she
told
me
for
some
new
types
if
it
were
any
consolation
and
there
is
a
sort
of
dignity
about
it
to
be
called
a
type
miss
liston
victims
were
always
welcome
to
so
much
and
she
had
found
them
in
chillington
and
pamela
the
former
appeared
to
my
dull
eye
to
offer
no
salient
novelty
he
was
tall
broad
handsome
and
he
possessed
a
manner
of
enviable
placidity
pamela
i
allowed
was
exactly
the
heroine
miss
liston
loved
haughty
capricious
difficile
but
sound
and
true
at
heart
i
was
mentally
skimming
volume
miss
liston
agreed
with
me
in
my
conception
of
pamela
but
declared
that
i
did
not
do
justice
to
the
artistic
possibilities
latent
in
chillington
he
had
a
curious
attraction
which
it
would
tax
her
skill
so
she
gravely
informed
me
to
the
utmost
to
reproduce
she
proposed
that
i
also
should
make
a
study
of
him
and
attributed
my
hurried
refusal
to
a
shrinking
from
the
difficulties
of
the
task
of
course
she
observed
looking
at
our
young
friends
who
were
talking
nonsense
at
the
other
side
of
the
lawn
they
must
have
a
misunderstanding
why
course
said
i
lighting
my
pipe
what
should
you
say
to
another
man
or
another
woman
said
miss
liston
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
said
i
about
a
volume
and
a
half
i
meant
but
it
more
interesting
do
you
think
she
better
be
a
married
woman
and
miss
liston
looked
at
me
inquiringly
the
age
prefers
them
married
i
remarked
this
conversation
happened
on
the
second
day
of
miss
liston
visit
and
she
lost
no
time
in
beginning
to
study
her
subjects
pamela
she
said
she
found
pretty
plain
sailing
but
chillington
continued
to
puzzle
her
again
she
could
not
make
up
her
mind
whether
to
have
a
happy
or
a
tragic
ending
in
the
interests
of
a
public
i
pleaded
for
yes
i
think
so
said
miss
liston
but
she
sighed
and
i
think
she
had
an
idea
or
two
for
a
separation
followed
by
mutual
hopeless
devotion
the
complexity
of
young
sir
gilbert
did
not
in
miss
liston
opinion
appear
less
on
further
acquaintance
and
indeed
i
must
admit
that
she
was
not
altogether
wrong
in
considering
him
worthy
of
attention
as
i
came
to
know
him
better
i
discerned
in
him
a
smothered
which
came
to
light
in
response
to
the
least
tribute
of
interest
or
admiration
but
was
yet
far
remote
from
the
aggressiveness
of
a
commonplace
vanity
in
a
moment
of
indiscretion
i
had
chaffed
him
he
was
very
on
the
risks
he
ran
at
miss
liston
hands
he
was
not
disgusted
but
neither
did
he
plume
himself
or
spread
his
feathers
he
received
the
suggestions
without
surprise
and
without
any
attempt
at
disclaiming
fitness
for
the
purpose
but
he
received
it
as
a
matter
which
entailed
a
responsibility
on
him
i
detected
the
conviction
that
if
the
portrait
was
to
be
painted
it
was
due
to
the
world
that
it
should
be
well
painted
the
subject
must
give
the
artist
full
opportunities
what
does
she
know
about
me
he
asked
in
meditative
tones
she
very
quick
she
soon
pick
up
as
much
as
she
wants
i
assured
him
she
probably
go
all
wrong
he
said
sombrely
and
of
course
i
could
not
tell
him
that
it
was
of
no
consequence
if
she
did
he
would
not
have
believed
me
and
would
have
done
precisely
what
he
proceeded
to
do
and
that
was
to
afford
miss
liston
every
chance
of
appraising
his
character
and
plumbing
the
depths
of
his
soul
i
may
say
at
once
that
i
did
not
regret
this
course
of
action
for
the
effect
of
it
was
to
allow
me
a
chance
of
talking
to
pamela
myles
and
pamela
was
exactly
the
sort
of
a
girl
to
beguile
the
long
pleasant
morning
hours
of
a
holiday
in
the
country
no
one
had
told
pamela
that
she
was
going
to
be
put
in
a
book
and
i
do
think
it
would
have
made
any
difference
had
she
been
told
pamela
attitude
towards
books
was
one
of
healthy
scorn
confidently
based
on
admitted
ignorance
so
we
never
spoke
of
them
and
my
cousin
dora
condoled
with
me
more
than
once
on
the
way
in
which
miss
liston
false
to
the
implied
terms
of
her
invitation
deserted
me
in
favor
of
sir
gilbert
and
left
me
to
the
mercies
of
a
frivolous
girl
pamela
appeared
to
be
as
little
aggrieved
as
i
was
i
imagined
that
she
supposed
that
chillington
would
ask
her
to
marry
him
some
day
before
very
long
and
i
was
sure
she
would
accept
him
but
it
was
quite
plain
that
if
miss
liston
persisted
in
making
pamela
her
heroine
she
would
have
to
supply
from
her
own
resources
a
large
supplement
of
passion
pamela
was
far
too
deficient
in
the
commodity
to
be
made
anything
of
without
such
reinforcement
even
by
an
art
more
adept
at
making
much
out
of
nothing
than
miss
straightforward
method
could
claim
to
be
a
week
passed
and
then
one
friday
morning
a
new
light
burst
on
me
miss
liston
came
into
the
garden
at
eleven
and
sat
down
by
me
on
the
lawn
chillington
and
pamela
had
gone
riding
with
the
squire
dora
was
visiting
the
poor
we
were
alone
the
appearance
of
miss
liston
at
this
hour
usually
sacred
to
the
use
of
the
pen
no
less
than
her
puzzled
look
told
me
that
an
obstruction
had
occurred
in
the
novel
presently
she
let
me
know
what
it
was
i
thinking
of
altering
the
scheme
of
my
story
wynne
said
she
have
you
ever
noticed
how
sometimes
a
man
thinks
he
in
love
when
he
is
really
such
a
case
sometimes
occurs
i
acknowledged
yes
and
he
does
find
out
his
mistake
till
they
married
sometimes
yes
she
said
rather
as
though
she
were
making
an
unwilling
admission
but
sometimes
he
sees
it
before
when
he
meets
somebody
else
very
true
said
i
with
a
grave
nod
the
false
ca
stand
against
the
real
pursued
miss
liston
and
then
she
fell
into
meditative
silence
i
stole
a
glance
at
her
face
she
was
smiling
was
it
in
the
pleasure
of
literary
creation
an
artistic
ecstasy
i
should
have
liked
to
answer
yes
but
i
doubted
it
very
much
without
pretending
to
miss
liston
powers
i
have
the
little
subtlety
that
is
needful
to
show
me
that
more
than
one
kind
of
smile
may
be
seen
on
the
human
face
and
that
there
is
one
very
different
from
others
and
finally
that
that
one
is
not
evoked
as
a
rule
merely
by
the
evolution
of
the
troublesome
encumbrance
in
pretty
writing
vulgarly
called
a
plot
if
pursued
miss
liston
some
one
comes
who
can
appreciate
him
and
draw
out
what
is
best
in
him
that
all
very
well
said
i
but
what
of
the
first
girl
oh
she
she
can
be
made
shallow
you
know
and
i
can
put
in
a
man
for
her
people
need
be
much
interested
in
her
yes
you
could
manage
it
that
way
said
i
thinking
how
pamela
i
took
the
liberty
of
using
her
name
for
the
shallow
girl
would
like
such
treatment
she
will
really
be
valuable
mainly
as
a
foil
observed
miss
liston
and
she
added
generously
i
shall
make
her
nice
you
know
but
shallow
not
worthy
of
him
and
what
are
you
going
to
make
the
other
girl
like
i
asked
miss
liston
started
slightly
also
she
colored
very
slightly
and
she
answered
looking
away
from
me
across
the
lawn
i
have
quite
made
up
my
mind
yet
mr
wynne
with
the
suspicion
which
this
conversation
aroused
fresh
in
my
mind
it
was
curious
to
hear
pamela
laugh
as
she
said
to
me
on
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
are
sir
gilbert
and
audrey
liston
funny
i
tell
you
what
wynne
i
believe
they
writing
a
novel
together
perhaps
chillington
giving
her
the
materials
for
one
i
suggested
i
should
think
observed
pamela
in
her
dispassionate
way
that
anything
very
interesting
had
ever
happened
to
him
thought
you
liked
him
i
remarked
humbly
so
i
do
what
that
got
to
do
with
it
asked
pamela
it
was
beyond
question
that
chillington
enjoyed
miss
liston
society
the
interest
she
showed
in
him
was
incense
to
his
nostrils
i
used
to
overhear
fragments
of
his
ideas
about
himself
which
he
was
revealing
in
answer
to
her
tactful
inquiries
but
neither
was
it
doubtful
that
he
had
by
no
means
lost
his
relish
for
pamela
lighter
talk
in
fact
he
seemed
to
turn
to
her
with
some
relief
perhaps
it
is
refreshing
to
escape
from
even
when
the
process
is
conducted
in
the
pleasantest
possible
manner
and
the
hours
which
miss
liston
gave
to
work
were
devoted
by
chillington
to
maintaining
his
cordial
relations
with
the
lady
whose
comfortable
and
not
disposal
was
taxing
miss
liston
skill
for
she
had
definitely
decided
all
her
plot
she
told
me
so
a
few
days
later
it
was
all
planned
out
nay
the
scene
in
which
the
truth
as
to
his
own
feelings
bursts
on
sir
gilbert
i
forget
at
the
moment
what
name
the
novel
gave
him
was
i
understood
actually
written
the
shallow
girl
was
to
experience
nothing
worse
than
a
wound
to
her
vanity
and
was
to
turn
with
as
much
alacrity
as
decency
allowed
to
the
substitute
whom
miss
liston
had
now
provided
all
this
was
poured
into
my
sympathetic
ear
and
i
say
sympathetic
with
all
sincerity
for
although
i
may
occasionally
treat
miss
liston
literary
efforts
with
less
than
proper
respect
she
herself
was
my
friend
and
the
conviction
under
which
she
was
now
living
would
i
knew
unless
it
were
justified
bring
her
into
much
of
that
unhappiness
in
which
one
generally
found
her
heroine
plunged
about
the
end
of
volume
ii
the
heroine
generally
got
out
all
right
and
the
knowledge
that
she
would
enabled
the
reader
to
preserve
cheerfulness
but
would
poor
little
miss
liston
get
out
i
was
none
too
sure
of
it
suddenly
a
change
came
in
the
state
of
affairs
pamela
produced
it
it
must
have
struck
her
that
the
increasing
intimacy
of
miss
liston
and
chillington
might
become
something
other
than
funny
to
put
it
briefly
and
metaphorically
she
whistled
her
dog
back
to
her
heels
i
am
not
skilled
in
understanding
or
describing
the
artifices
of
ladies
but
even
i
saw
the
transformation
in
pamela
she
put
forth
her
strength
and
put
on
her
prettiest
gowns
she
refused
to
take
her
place
in
the
of
society
which
chillington
had
recently
established
for
his
pleasure
if
he
spent
an
hour
with
miss
liston
pamela
would
have
nothing
of
him
for
a
day
she
met
his
attentions
with
scorn
unless
they
were
undivided
chillington
seemed
at
first
puzzled
i
believe
that
he
never
regarded
his
talks
with
miss
liston
in
other
than
a
business
point
of
view
but
directly
he
understood
that
pamela
claimed
him
and
that
she
was
prepared
in
case
he
did
not
obey
her
call
to
establish
a
grievance
against
him
he
lost
no
time
in
manifesting
his
obedience
a
whole
day
passed
in
which
to
my
certain
knowledge
he
was
not
alone
a
moment
with
miss
liston
and
did
not
save
at
the
family
meals
exchange
a
word
with
her
as
he
walked
off
with
pamela
miss
eyes
followed
him
in
wistful
longing
she
stole
away
upstairs
and
did
not
come
down
till
five
then
finding
me
strolling
about
with
a
cigarette
she
joined
me
well
how
goes
the
book
i
asked
i
have
done
much
to
it
just
lately
she
answered
in
a
low
voice
i
it
i
do
quite
know
what
to
do
with
it
i
thought
you
settled
so
i
had
but
oh
do
let
talk
about
it
mr
wynne
but
a
moment
later
she
went
on
talking
about
it
i
do
know
why
i
should
make
it
end
happily
she
said
i
sure
life
is
always
happy
is
it
certainly
not
i
answered
you
mean
your
man
might
stick
to
the
shallow
girl
after
all
yes
i
just
heard
her
whisper
and
be
miserable
afterwards
i
pursued
i
do
know
said
miss
liston
perhaps
he
would
then
you
must
make
him
shallow
himself
i
ca
do
that
she
said
quickly
oh
how
difficult
it
is
she
may
have
meant
merely
the
art
of
writing
when
i
cordially
agreed
with
her
but
i
think
she
meant
also
the
way
of
the
world
which
does
not
make
me
withdraw
my
assent
i
left
her
walking
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
windows
a
rather
forlorn
little
figure
thrown
into
distinctness
by
the
cold
rays
of
the
setting
sun
all
was
not
over
yet
that
evening
chillington
broke
away
led
by
vanity
or
interest
or
friendliness
i
know
not
which
tired
maybe
of
paying
court
the
attitude
in
which
pamela
kept
him
and
thinking
it
would
be
pleasant
to
play
the
other
part
for
a
while
after
dinner
he
went
straight
to
miss
liston
talked
to
her
while
we
had
coffee
on
the
terrace
and
then
walked
about
with
her
pamela
sat
by
me
she
was
very
silent
she
did
not
appear
to
be
angry
but
her
handsome
mouth
wore
a
resolute
expression
chillington
and
miss
liston
wandered
on
into
the
shrubbery
and
did
not
come
into
sight
again
for
nearly
half
an
hour
i
think
it
cold
said
pamela
in
her
cool
quiet
tones
and
also
wynne
rather
slow
i
shall
go
to
bed
i
thought
it
a
little
impertinent
of
pamela
to
attribute
the
which
had
undoubtedly
existed
to
me
so
i
took
my
revenge
by
saying
with
an
assumption
of
innocence
purposely
and
obviously
unreal
oh
but
wo
you
wait
and
bid
miss
liston
and
chillington
pamela
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
i
made
bold
to
smile
pamela
face
broke
slowly
into
an
answering
smile
i
do
know
what
you
mean
wynne
said
she
no
said
i
no
said
pamela
and
she
turned
away
but
before
she
went
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
and
still
smiling
said
wish
miss
liston
for
me
wynne
anything
i
have
to
say
to
sir
gilbert
will
wait
very
well
till
she
had
hardly
gone
in
when
the
wanderers
came
out
of
the
shrubbery
and
rejoined
me
chillington
wore
his
usual
passive
look
but
miss
face
was
happy
and
radiant
chillington
passed
on
into
the
miss
liston
lingered
a
moment
by
me
why
you
look
said
i
as
if
you
invented
the
finest
scene
ever
written
she
did
not
answer
me
directly
but
stood
looking
up
at
the
stars
then
she
said
in
a
dreamy
tone
i
think
i
shall
stick
to
my
old
idea
in
the
book
as
she
spoke
chillington
came
out
even
in
the
dim
light
i
saw
a
frown
on
his
face
i
say
wynne
said
he
where
miss
myles
she
gone
to
bed
i
answered
she
told
me
to
wish
you
for
her
miss
liston
no
message
for
you
chillington
miss
liston
eyes
were
on
him
he
took
no
notice
of
her
he
stood
frowning
for
an
instant
then
with
some
muttered
ejaculation
he
strode
back
into
the
house
we
hoard
his
heavy
tread
across
the
we
heard
the
door
slammed
behind
him
and
i
found
myself
looking
on
miss
liston
altered
face
what
does
he
want
her
for
i
wonder
she
said
in
an
agitation
that
made
my
presence
my
thoughts
my
suspicions
nothing
to
her
he
said
nothing
to
me
about
wanting
to
speak
to
her
and
she
walked
slowly
into
the
house
her
eyes
on
the
ground
and
all
the
light
gone
from
her
face
and
the
joy
dead
in
it
whereupon
i
left
alone
began
to
rail
at
the
gods
that
a
dear
silly
little
soul
like
miss
liston
should
bother
her
poor
silly
little
head
about
a
hulking
fool
in
which
reflections
i
did
of
course
immense
injustice
not
only
to
an
eminent
author
but
also
to
a
perfectly
honorable
though
somewhat
dense
and
decidedly
conceited
gentleman
the
next
morning
sir
gilbert
chillington
ate
dirt
there
is
no
other
way
of
expressing
it
in
great
quantities
and
with
infinite
humility
my
admirable
friend
miss
pamela
was
severe
i
saw
him
walk
six
yards
behind
her
for
the
length
of
the
terrace
not
a
look
nor
a
turn
of
her
head
gave
him
leave
to
join
her
miss
liston
had
gone
upstairs
and
i
watched
the
scene
from
the
window
of
the
at
last
at
the
end
of
the
long
walk
just
where
the
mark
the
beginning
of
the
shrubberies
on
the
threshold
of
the
scene
of
his
crime
pamela
turned
round
suddenly
and
faced
the
repentant
sinner
the
most
interesting
things
in
life
are
those
which
perhaps
by
the
inevitable
nature
of
the
case
one
does
not
hear
and
i
did
not
hear
the
scene
which
followed
for
a
while
they
stood
talking
rather
he
talked
and
she
listened
then
she
turned
again
and
walked
slowly
into
the
shrubbery
chillington
followed
it
was
the
end
of
a
chapter
and
i
laid
down
the
book
how
and
from
whom
miss
liston
heard
the
news
which
chillington
himself
told
me
without
a
glimmer
of
shame
or
a
touch
of
embarrassment
some
two
hours
later
i
do
not
know
but
hear
it
she
did
before
luncheon
for
she
came
down
ready
armed
with
the
neatest
little
speeches
for
both
the
happy
lovers
i
did
not
expect
pamela
to
show
an
ounce
more
feeling
than
the
strictest
canons
of
propriety
demanded
and
she
fulfilled
my
expectations
to
the
letter
but
i
had
hoped
i
confess
that
chillington
would
have
displayed
some
little
consciousness
he
did
not
and
it
is
my
belief
that
throughout
the
events
which
i
have
recorded
he
retained
and
that
he
still
retains
the
conviction
that
miss
liston
interest
in
him
was
purely
literary
and
artistic
and
that
she
devoted
herself
to
his
society
simply
because
he
offered
an
interesting
problem
and
an
inspiring
theme
an
ingenious
charity
may
find
in
that
attitude
evidence
of
modesty
to
my
thinking
it
argues
a
more
subtle
and
magnificent
conceit
than
if
he
had
fathomed
the
truth
as
many
humbler
men
in
his
place
would
have
done
on
the
day
after
the
engagement
was
accomplished
miss
liston
left
us
to
return
to
london
she
came
out
in
her
hat
and
jacket
and
sat
down
by
me
the
carriage
was
to
be
round
in
ten
minutes
she
put
on
her
gloves
slowly
and
buttoned
them
carefully
this
done
she
said
by
the
way
wynne
i
adopted
your
suggestion
the
man
does
find
out
then
you
made
him
a
fool
i
asked
bluntly
no
she
answered
i
i
think
it
might
happen
though
he
was
a
fool
she
sat
with
her
hands
in
her
lap
for
a
moment
or
two
then
she
went
on
in
a
lower
voice
i
going
to
make
him
find
out
afterwards
i
felt
her
glance
on
me
but
i
looked
straight
in
front
of
me
what
after
he
married
the
shallow
girl
yes
said
miss
liston
rather
too
late
is
it
at
least
if
you
mean
there
is
to
be
a
happy
ending
miss
liston
enlaced
her
fingers
i
have
decided
about
the
ending
yet
said
she
if
you
intent
is
to
be
tragical
which
is
the
fashion
you
do
as
you
stand
said
i
yes
she
answered
slowly
if
i
tragical
i
shall
do
as
i
stand
there
was
another
pause
and
rather
a
long
one
the
wheels
of
the
carriage
were
audible
on
the
gravel
of
the
front
drive
miss
liston
stood
up
i
rose
and
held
out
my
hand
of
course
said
miss
liston
still
intent
on
her
novel
i
could
she
stopped
again
and
looked
apprehensively
at
me
my
face
i
believe
expressed
nothing
more
than
polite
attention
and
friendly
interest
of
course
she
began
again
the
shallow
girl
his
wife
might
might
die
mr
wynne
in
novels
said
i
with
a
smile
while
there
death
there
hope
yes
in
novels
she
answered
giving
me
her
hand
the
poor
little
woman
was
very
unhappy
unwisely
i
dare
say
i
pressed
her
hand
it
was
enough
the
tears
leapt
to
her
eyes
she
gave
my
great
fist
a
hurried
squeeze
i
have
seldom
been
more
touched
by
any
thanks
however
warm
or
eloquent
and
hurried
away
i
have
read
the
novel
it
came
out
a
little
while
ago
the
man
finds
out
after
the
marriage
the
shallow
girl
dies
un
regretted
she
turns
out
as
badly
as
possible
the
real
love
comes
and
all
ends
joyfully
it
is
simple
story
prettily
told
in
its
little
way
and
the
scene
of
the
reunion
is
written
with
genuine
feeling
nay
with
a
touch
of
real
passion
but
then
sir
gilbert
chillington
never
meets
miss
liston
now
and
lady
chillington
not
only
behaves
with
her
customary
propriety
but
is
in
the
enjoyment
of
most
excellent
health
and
spirits
true
art
demands
an
adaptation
not
a
copy
of
life
i
saw
that
remark
somewhere
the
other
day
it
seems
correct
if
miss
liston
be
any
authority
the
philosopher
in
the
apple
orchard
it
was
a
charmingly
mild
and
balmy
day
the
sun
shone
beyond
the
orchard
and
the
shade
was
cool
inside
a
light
breeze
stirred
the
boughs
of
the
old
under
which
the
philosopher
sat
none
of
these
things
did
the
philosopher
notice
unless
it
might
be
when
the
wind
blew
about
the
leaves
of
the
large
volume
on
his
knees
and
he
had
to
find
his
place
again
then
he
would
exclaim
against
the
wind
shuffle
the
leaves
till
he
got
the
right
page
and
settle
to
his
reading
the
book
was
a
treatise
on
ontology
it
was
written
by
another
philosopher
a
friend
of
this
philosopher
it
bristled
with
fallacies
and
this
philosopher
was
discovering
them
all
and
noting
them
on
the
at
the
end
he
was
not
going
to
review
the
book
as
some
might
have
thought
from
his
behavior
or
even
to
answer
it
in
a
work
of
his
own
it
was
just
that
he
found
a
pleasure
in
stripping
any
poor
fallacy
naked
and
crucifying
it
presently
a
girl
in
a
white
frock
came
into
the
orchard
she
picked
up
an
apple
bit
it
and
found
it
ripe
holding
it
in
her
hand
she
walked
up
to
where
the
philosopher
sat
and
looked
at
him
he
did
not
stir
she
took
a
bite
out
of
the
apple
munched
it
and
swallowed
it
the
philosopher
crucified
a
fallacy
on
the
the
girl
flung
the
apple
away
jerningham
said
she
are
you
very
busy
the
philosopher
pencil
in
hand
looked
up
no
miss
may
said
he
not
very
because
i
want
your
opinion
in
one
moment
said
the
philosopher
apologetically
he
turned
back
to
the
and
began
to
nail
the
last
fallacy
a
little
tighter
to
the
cross
the
girl
regarded
him
first
with
amused
impatience
then
with
a
vexed
frown
finally
with
a
wistful
regret
he
was
so
very
old
for
his
age
she
thought
he
could
not
be
much
beyond
thirty
his
hair
was
thick
and
full
of
waves
his
eyes
bright
and
clear
his
complexion
not
yet
divested
of
all
youth
relics
now
miss
may
i
at
your
service
said
the
philosopher
with
a
lingering
look
at
his
impaled
fallacy
and
he
closed
the
book
keeping
it
however
on
his
knee
the
girl
sat
down
just
opposite
to
him
it
a
very
important
thing
i
want
to
ask
you
she
began
tugging
at
a
tuft
of
grass
and
it
very
difficult
and
you
must
tell
any
one
i
asked
you
at
least
i
rather
you
did
i
shall
not
speak
of
it
indeed
i
shall
probably
not
remember
it
said
the
philosopher
and
you
must
look
at
me
please
while
i
asking
you
i
do
think
i
was
looking
at
you
but
if
i
was
i
beg
your
pardon
said
the
philosopher
apologetically
she
pulled
the
tuft
of
grass
right
out
of
the
ground
and
flung
it
from
her
with
all
her
force
suppose
a
man
she
began
no
that
not
right
you
can
take
any
hypothesis
you
please
observed
the
philosopher
but
you
must
verify
it
afterward
of
course
oh
do
let
me
go
on
suppose
a
girl
jerningham
i
wish
you
would
nod
it
was
only
to
show
that
i
followed
you
oh
of
course
you
me
as
you
call
it
suppose
a
girl
had
two
lovers
you
nodding
again
or
i
ought
to
say
suppose
there
were
two
men
who
might
be
in
love
with
a
girl
only
two
asked
the
philosopher
you
see
any
number
of
men
might
be
in
love
with
oh
we
can
leave
the
rest
out
said
miss
may
with
a
sudden
dimple
they
do
matter
very
well
said
the
philosopher
if
they
are
irrelevant
we
will
put
them
aside
suppose
then
that
one
of
these
men
was
oh
in
love
with
the
girl
and
and
proposed
you
know
a
moment
said
the
philosopher
opening
a
let
me
take
down
his
proposition
what
was
it
why
proposed
to
her
asked
her
to
marry
him
said
the
girl
with
a
stare
dear
me
how
stupid
of
me
i
forgot
that
special
use
of
the
word
yes
the
girl
likes
him
pretty
well
and
her
people
approve
of
him
and
all
that
you
know
that
simplifies
the
problem
said
the
philosopher
nodding
again
but
she
not
in
in
love
with
him
you
know
she
does
really
care
for
him
much
do
you
understand
perfectly
it
is
a
most
natural
state
of
mind
well
then
suppose
that
there
another
man
what
are
you
writing
i
only
put
down
b
like
that
pleaded
the
philosopher
meekly
exhibiting
his
she
looked
at
him
in
a
sort
of
helpless
exasperation
with
just
a
smile
somewhere
in
the
background
of
it
oh
you
really
are
she
exclaimed
but
let
me
go
on
the
other
man
is
a
friend
of
the
girl
he
very
clever
oh
fearfully
clever
and
he
rather
handsome
you
need
put
that
down
it
is
certainly
not
very
material
admitted
the
philosopher
and
he
crossed
out
he
left
and
the
girl
is
most
awfully
she
admires
him
tremendously
she
thinks
him
just
the
greatest
man
that
ever
lived
you
know
and
she
she
the
girl
paused
i
following
said
the
philosopher
with
pencil
poised
she
think
it
better
than
the
whole
world
if
if
she
could
be
anything
to
him
you
know
you
mean
become
his
wife
well
of
course
i
do
at
least
i
suppose
i
do
you
spoke
rather
vaguely
you
know
the
girl
cast
one
glance
at
the
philosopher
as
she
replied
well
yes
i
did
mean
become
his
wife
yes
well
but
continued
the
girl
starting
on
another
tuft
of
grass
he
does
think
much
about
those
things
he
likes
her
i
think
he
likes
well
does
dislike
her
suggested
the
philosopher
shall
we
call
him
indifferent
i
do
know
yes
rather
indifferent
i
do
think
he
thinks
about
it
you
know
but
she
she
pretty
you
need
put
that
down
i
was
not
about
to
do
so
observed
the
philosopher
she
thinks
life
with
him
would
be
just
heaven
she
thinks
she
would
make
him
awfully
happy
she
be
so
proud
of
him
you
see
i
see
yes
and
i
do
know
how
to
put
it
quite
she
thinks
that
if
he
ever
thought
about
it
at
all
he
might
care
for
her
because
he
does
care
for
anybody
else
and
she
pretty
you
said
that
before
oh
dear
i
dare
say
i
did
and
most
men
care
for
somebody
do
they
some
girl
i
mean
most
men
no
doubt
conceded
the
philosopher
well
then
what
ought
she
to
do
it
not
a
real
thing
you
know
jerningham
it
in
in
a
novel
i
was
reading
she
said
this
hastily
and
blushed
as
she
spoke
dear
me
and
it
quite
an
interesting
case
yes
i
see
the
question
is
will
she
act
most
wisely
in
accepting
the
offer
of
the
man
who
loves
her
exceedingly
but
for
whom
she
entertains
only
a
moderate
affection
yes
just
a
liking
he
just
a
friend
exactly
or
in
marrying
the
other
whom
she
loves
ex
that
not
it
how
can
she
marry
him
he
has
he
has
asked
her
you
see
true
i
forgot
let
us
assume
though
for
the
moment
that
he
has
asked
her
she
would
then
have
to
consider
which
marriage
would
probably
be
productive
of
the
greater
sum
total
of
oh
but
you
need
consider
that
but
it
seems
the
best
logical
order
we
can
afterward
make
allowance
for
the
element
of
uncertainty
caused
by
oh
no
i
do
want
it
like
that
i
know
perfectly
well
which
she
do
if
other
man
you
her
you
apprehend
that
never
mind
what
i
take
it
as
i
told
you
very
good
a
has
asked
her
hand
b
has
not
yes
may
i
take
it
that
but
for
the
disturbing
influence
of
b
a
would
be
a
satisfactory
er
candidate
ye
es
i
think
so
she
therefore
enjoys
a
certainty
of
considerable
happiness
if
she
marries
a
ye
es
not
perfect
because
of
b
you
know
quite
so
quite
so
but
still
a
fair
amount
of
happiness
is
it
not
so
i
do
well
perhaps
on
the
other
hand
if
b
did
ask
her
we
are
to
postulate
a
higher
degree
of
happiness
for
her
yes
please
jerningham
much
higher
for
both
of
them
for
her
never
mind
him
very
well
that
again
simplifies
the
problem
but
his
asking
her
is
a
contingency
only
yes
that
all
the
philosopher
spread
out
his
hands
my
dear
young
lady
he
said
it
becomes
a
question
of
degree
how
probable
or
improbable
is
it
i
do
know
not
very
probable
unless
well
unless
he
did
happen
to
notice
you
know
ah
yes
we
supposed
that
if
he
thought
of
it
he
would
probably
take
the
desired
least
that
he
might
be
led
to
do
so
could
she
not
er
indicate
her
preference
she
might
try
no
she
could
do
much
you
see
he
he
does
think
about
such
things
i
understand
precisely
and
it
seems
to
me
miss
may
that
in
that
very
fact
we
find
our
solution
do
we
she
asked
i
think
so
he
has
evidently
no
natural
inclination
toward
her
perhaps
not
toward
marriage
at
all
any
feeling
aroused
in
him
would
be
necessarily
shallow
and
in
a
measure
artificial
and
in
all
likelihood
purely
temporary
moreover
if
she
took
steps
to
arouse
his
attention
one
of
two
things
would
be
likely
to
happen
are
you
following
me
yes
mr
jerningham
either
he
would
be
repelled
by
her
overtures
which
you
must
admit
is
not
improbable
and
then
the
position
would
be
unpleasant
and
even
degrading
for
her
or
on
the
other
hand
he
might
through
a
misplaced
feeling
of
gallantry
through
what
through
a
mistaken
idea
of
politeness
or
a
mistaken
view
of
what
was
kind
allow
himself
to
be
drawn
into
a
connection
for
which
he
had
no
genuine
liking
you
agree
with
me
that
one
or
other
of
these
things
would
be
likely
yes
i
suppose
they
would
unless
he
did
come
to
care
for
her
ah
you
return
to
that
hypothesis
i
think
it
an
extremely
fanciful
one
no
she
need
not
marry
a
but
she
must
let
b
alone
the
philosopher
closed
his
book
took
off
his
glasses
wiped
them
replaced
them
and
leaned
back
against
the
trunk
of
the
the
girl
picked
a
dandelion
in
pieces
after
a
long
pause
she
asked
you
think
b
feelings
would
be
at
all
likely
to
to
change
that
depends
on
the
sort
of
man
he
is
but
if
he
is
an
able
man
with
intellectual
interests
which
engross
man
who
has
chosen
his
path
in
life
a
man
to
whom
women
society
is
not
a
necessity
he
just
like
that
said
the
girl
and
she
bit
the
head
off
a
daisy
then
said
the
philosopher
i
see
not
the
least
reason
for
supposing
that
his
feelings
will
change
and
would
you
advise
her
to
marry
the
other
a
well
on
the
whole
i
should
a
is
a
good
fellow
i
think
we
made
a
a
good
fellow
he
is
a
suitable
match
his
love
for
her
is
true
and
genuine
it
tremendous
yes
and
er
extreme
she
likes
him
there
is
every
reason
to
hope
that
her
liking
will
develop
into
a
sufficiently
deep
and
stable
affection
she
will
get
rid
of
her
folly
about
b
and
make
a
a
good
wife
yes
miss
may
if
i
were
the
author
of
your
novel
i
should
make
her
marry
a
and
i
should
call
that
a
happy
ending
a
silence
followed
it
was
broken
by
the
philosopher
is
that
all
you
wanted
my
opinion
about
miss
may
he
asked
with
his
finger
between
the
leaves
of
the
treatise
on
ontology
yes
i
think
so
i
hope
i
have
bored
you
i
enjoyed
the
discussion
extremely
i
had
no
idea
that
novels
raised
points
of
such
psychological
interest
i
must
find
time
to
read
one
the
girl
had
shifted
her
position
till
instead
of
her
full
face
her
profile
was
turned
toward
him
looking
away
toward
the
paddock
that
lay
brilliant
in
sunshine
on
the
skirts
of
the
apple
orchard
she
asked
in
low
slow
tones
twisting
her
hands
in
her
lap
do
you
think
that
perhaps
if
b
found
out
she
had
married
a
you
know
that
she
had
cared
for
him
so
very
very
much
he
might
be
a
little
sorry
if
he
were
a
gentleman
he
would
regret
it
deeply
i
mean
sorry
on
his
own
account
that
that
he
had
thrown
away
all
that
you
know
the
philosopher
looked
meditative
i
think
he
pronounced
that
it
is
very
possible
he
would
i
can
well
imagine
it
he
might
never
find
anybody
to
love
him
like
that
again
she
said
gazing
on
the
gleaming
paddock
he
probably
would
not
agreed
the
philosopher
and
and
most
people
like
being
loved
do
they
to
crave
for
love
is
an
almost
universal
instinct
miss
may
yes
almost
she
said
with
a
dreary
little
smile
you
see
get
old
have
no
one
to
look
after
him
he
will
and
no
home
well
in
a
sense
none
corrected
the
philosopher
smiling
but
really
you
frighten
me
i
a
bachelor
myself
you
know
miss
may
yes
she
whispered
just
audibly
and
all
your
terrors
are
before
me
well
unless
oh
we
need
have
that
laughed
the
philosopher
cheerfully
there
no
about
it
miss
may
the
girl
jumped
to
her
feet
for
an
instant
she
looked
at
the
philosopher
she
opened
her
lips
as
if
to
speak
and
at
the
thought
of
what
lay
at
her
tongue
tip
her
face
grew
red
but
the
philosopher
was
gazing
past
her
and
his
eyes
rested
in
calm
contemplation
on
the
gleaming
paddock
a
beautiful
thing
sunshine
to
be
sure
said
he
her
blush
faded
away
into
paleness
her
lips
closed
without
speaking
she
turned
and
walked
slowly
away
her
head
drooping
the
philosopher
heard
the
rustle
of
her
skirt
in
the
long
grass
of
the
orchard
he
watched
her
for
a
few
moments
a
pretty
graceful
creature
said
he
with
a
smile
then
he
opened
his
book
took
his
pencil
in
his
hand
and
slipped
in
a
careful
forefinger
to
mark
the
the
sun
had
passed
and
began
to
decline
westward
before
he
finished
the
book
then
he
stretched
himself
and
looked
at
his
watch
good
gracious
two
i
shall
be
late
for
lunch
and
he
hurried
to
his
feet
he
was
very
late
for
lunch
everything
cold
wailed
his
hostess
where
have
you
been
mr
jerningham
only
in
the
orchard
reading
and
you
missed
may
missed
miss
may
how
do
you
mean
i
had
a
long
talk
with
her
this
most
interesting
talk
but
you
were
here
to
say
now
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
forgot
that
she
was
leaving
by
the
train
what
a
man
you
are
dear
me
to
think
of
my
forgetting
it
said
the
philosopher
shamefacedly
she
told
me
to
say
to
you
for
her
she
very
kind
i
ca
forgive
myself
his
hostess
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
then
she
sighed
and
smiled
and
sighed
again
have
you
everything
you
want
she
asked
everything
thank
you
said
he
sitting
down
opposite
the
cheese
and
propping
his
book
he
thought
he
would
just
run
through
the
last
chapter
again
against
the
loaf
everything
in
the
world
that
i
want
thanks
his
hostess
did
not
tell
him
that
the
girl
had
come
in
from
the
apple
orchard
and
run
hastily
upstairs
lest
her
friend
should
see
what
her
friend
did
see
in
her
eyes
so
that
he
had
no
suspicion
at
all
that
he
had
received
an
offer
of
refused
it
and
he
did
not
refer
to
anything
of
that
sort
when
he
paused
once
in
his
reading
and
exclaimed
i
really
sorry
i
missed
miss
may
that
was
an
interesting
case
of
hers
but
i
gave
the
right
answer
the
girl
ought
to
marry
a
and
so
the
girl
did
the
decree
of
duke
deodonato
it
is
a
most
anxious
thing
to
be
an
absolute
ruler
said
duke
deodonato
but
i
have
made
up
my
mind
the
doctor
has
convinced
me
here
fusbius
bowed
very
low
that
marriage
is
the
best
noblest
wholesomest
and
happiest
of
human
conditions
your
highness
will
remember
began
the
president
of
the
council
my
lord
i
have
made
up
my
mind
said
duke
deodonato
thus
speaking
the
duke
took
a
large
sheet
of
foolscap
paper
and
wrote
rapidly
for
a
moment
or
two
there
he
said
pushing
the
paper
over
to
the
president
is
the
decree
the
decree
sir
i
think
three
weeks
afford
ample
space
said
duke
deodonato
three
weeks
sir
for
every
man
over
years
of
age
in
this
duchy
to
find
himself
a
wife
your
highness
observed
fusbius
with
deference
will
consider
that
between
an
abstract
proposition
and
a
practical
measure
there
is
to
the
logical
mind
no
interrupted
duke
deodonato
but
sir
cried
the
president
imagine
the
consternation
which
this
let
it
be
gazetted
said
duke
deodonato
i
would
venture
said
the
president
to
remind
your
highness
that
you
are
yourself
a
bachelor
laws
said
duke
deodonato
do
not
bind
the
crown
unless
the
crown
is
expressly
mentioned
true
sir
but
i
humbly
conceive
that
it
would
be
pessimi
exempli
you
are
right
i
will
marry
myself
said
duke
deodonato
but
sir
three
weeks
the
hand
of
a
princess
can
not
be
requested
and
granted
in
then
find
me
somebody
else
said
deodonato
and
pray
leave
me
i
would
be
alone
and
duke
deodonato
waved
his
hand
to
the
door
outside
the
door
the
president
said
to
the
doctor
i
could
wish
sir
that
you
had
not
convinced
his
highness
my
lord
rejoined
the
doctor
truth
is
my
only
preoccupation
sir
said
the
president
are
you
married
my
lord
answered
the
doctor
i
am
not
i
thought
not
said
the
president
as
he
folded
up
the
decree
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
it
is
useless
to
deny
that
duke
deodonato
decree
caused
considerable
disturbance
in
the
duchy
in
the
first
place
the
crown
lawyers
raised
a
puzzle
of
law
did
the
word
as
used
in
the
decree
include
the
president
shook
his
head
and
referred
the
question
to
his
highness
it
seems
immaterial
observed
the
duke
if
a
man
marries
a
woman
marries
ex
vi
terminorum
assented
the
doctor
but
sir
said
the
president
there
are
more
women
than
men
in
the
duchy
duke
deodonato
threw
down
his
pen
this
is
very
provoking
said
he
why
was
it
allowed
i
sure
it
happened
before
came
to
the
throne
the
doctor
was
about
to
point
out
that
it
could
hardly
have
been
guarded
against
when
the
president
who
was
a
better
courtier
anticipated
him
we
did
not
foresee
that
your
highness
in
your
highness
wisdom
would
issue
this
decree
he
said
humbly
true
said
duke
deodonato
who
was
a
just
man
would
your
highness
vouchsafe
any
explanation
what
are
the
judges
for
asked
duke
deodonato
there
is
the
law
let
them
interpret
it
whereupon
the
judges
held
that
a
was
not
a
and
that
although
every
man
must
marry
no
woman
need
it
will
make
no
difference
said
the
president
none
at
all
said
fusbius
nor
perhaps
would
it
seeing
that
women
are
ever
kind
and
in
no
way
by
nature
averse
from
marriage
had
it
not
become
known
that
duke
deodonato
himself
intended
to
choose
a
wife
from
the
ladies
of
his
own
dominions
and
to
choose
her
according
to
the
advice
of
fusbius
who
in
truth
saw
little
whither
his
counsel
would
in
the
end
carry
the
duke
without
regard
to
such
adventitious
matters
as
rank
or
wealth
and
purely
for
her
beauty
talent
and
virtue
which
resolve
being
proclaimed
straightway
all
the
ladies
of
the
duchy
of
whatsoever
station
calling
age
appearance
wit
or
character
conceiving
each
of
them
that
she
and
no
other
should
become
the
duchess
sturdily
refused
all
offers
of
marriage
although
they
were
many
of
them
as
desperately
enamored
as
virtuous
ladies
may
be
and
did
nought
else
than
walk
drive
ride
and
display
their
charms
in
the
park
before
the
windows
of
the
ducal
palace
and
thus
it
fell
out
that
when
a
week
had
gone
by
no
man
had
obeyed
duke
deodonato
decree
and
they
were
from
sheer
want
of
brides
like
to
fall
into
contempt
of
the
law
and
under
the
high
displeasure
of
the
duke
upon
this
the
president
and
fusbius
sought
audience
of
his
highness
and
humbly
laid
before
him
the
unforeseen
obstacle
which
had
occurred
woman
is
ever
ambitious
said
fusbius
nay
corrected
the
president
they
have
seen
his
highness
person
as
his
highness
has
ridden
through
the
city
duke
deodonato
threw
down
his
pen
this
is
very
tiresome
said
he
knitting
his
brows
my
lord
i
would
be
further
advised
on
this
matter
return
at
the
same
hour
the
next
day
duke
deodonato
forehead
had
regained
its
customary
smoothness
and
his
manner
was
tranquil
and
assured
our
pleasure
is
said
he
to
the
president
that
albeit
no
woman
shall
be
compelled
to
marry
if
so
be
that
she
be
not
invited
thereunto
yet
if
bidden
she
shall
in
no
wise
refuse
but
straightway
espouse
that
man
who
first
after
the
date
of
these
presents
shall
solicit
her
hand
the
president
bowed
in
admiration
it
is
if
i
may
humbly
say
so
a
practical
and
wise
solution
sir
he
said
i
apprehend
that
it
will
remedy
the
mischief
said
duke
deodonato
not
and
doubtless
it
would
have
had
an
effect
as
altogether
satisfactory
excellent
beneficial
salutary
and
universal
as
the
wisdom
of
duke
deodonato
had
anticipated
from
it
had
it
not
fallen
out
that
on
the
promulgation
of
the
decree
all
the
aforesaid
ladies
of
the
duchy
of
whatsoever
station
calling
age
appearance
wit
or
character
straightway
and
so
swiftly
that
no
man
had
time
wherein
to
pay
his
court
to
them
fled
to
and
shut
and
bottled
and
barricaded
themselves
in
houses
castles
cupboards
cellars
stables
lofts
churches
chapels
chests
and
every
other
kind
of
receptacle
whatsoever
and
there
remained
beyond
reach
of
any
man
be
he
whom
he
would
lest
haply
one
coming
should
ask
their
hand
in
marriage
and
thus
they
should
lose
all
prospect
of
wedding
the
duke
when
duke
deodonato
was
apprised
of
this
lamentable
action
on
the
part
of
the
ladies
of
the
duchy
he
frowned
and
laid
down
his
pen
this
is
very
annoying
said
he
there
appears
to
be
a
disposition
to
thwart
our
endeavors
for
the
public
good
it
is
gross
contumacy
said
fusbius
yet
remarked
the
president
inspired
by
a
natural
if
admiration
for
his
highness
person
the
decree
is
now
a
fortnight
old
observed
duke
deodonato
leave
me
i
will
consider
further
of
this
matter
now
even
as
his
highness
spoke
a
mighty
uproar
arose
under
the
palace
windows
and
duke
deodonato
looking
out
of
the
window
which
be
it
remembered
but
for
the
guidance
of
heaven
he
might
not
have
done
beheld
a
maiden
of
wonderful
charms
struggling
in
the
clutches
of
two
halberdiers
of
the
guard
who
were
haling
her
off
to
prison
bring
hither
that
damsel
said
deodonato
presently
the
damsel
still
held
by
the
soldiers
entered
the
room
her
robe
was
dishevelled
and
rent
her
golden
hair
hung
loose
on
her
shoulders
and
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
at
whose
suit
is
she
arrested
asked
deodonato
at
the
suit
of
the
most
learned
fusbius
may
it
please
your
highness
sir
said
fusbius
it
is
true
this
lady
grossly
contemning
your
highness
decree
has
refused
my
hand
in
marriage
is
it
true
damsel
asked
duke
deodonato
hear
me
your
highness
answered
she
i
left
my
dwelling
but
an
instant
for
we
were
in
sore
straits
for
bread
asked
deodonato
a
touch
of
sympathy
in
his
voice
may
it
please
your
highness
no
pins
wherewith
to
fasten
our
hair
and
as
i
ran
to
the
merchant
this
aged
man
i
am
but
turned
of
fifty
interrupted
fusbius
and
have
not
yet
learnt
silence
asked
deodonato
severely
damsel
proceed
caught
me
by
my
gown
as
i
ran
and
i
proposed
marriage
to
her
said
fusbius
nay
if
you
proposed
marriage
she
shall
marry
you
said
deodonato
by
the
crown
of
my
fathers
she
shall
marry
you
but
what
said
he
damsel
may
it
please
your
highness
he
said
that
i
had
the
prettiest
face
in
all
the
duchy
and
that
he
would
have
no
wife
but
me
and
thereupon
he
kissed
me
and
i
would
have
none
of
him
and
i
struck
him
and
escaped
send
for
the
judges
said
duke
deodonato
and
meanwhile
keep
this
damsel
and
let
no
man
propose
marriage
to
her
until
our
pleasure
be
known
now
when
the
judges
were
come
and
the
maiden
was
brought
in
and
set
over
against
them
on
the
right
hand
and
the
learned
doctor
took
his
stand
on
the
left
deodonato
prayed
the
judges
that
they
would
perpend
carefully
and
anxiously
of
the
question
using
all
lore
research
wisdom
discretion
and
justice
whether
fusbius
had
proposed
marriage
unto
the
maiden
or
no
thus
shalt
our
mind
be
informed
and
we
shall
deal
profitably
with
this
matter
concluded
duke
deodonato
upon
which
arose
great
debate
for
there
was
one
part
of
the
learned
men
which
leant
upon
the
letter
and
found
no
invitation
to
marriage
in
the
words
of
fusbius
while
another
part
would
have
it
that
in
all
things
the
spirit
and
mind
of
the
utterer
must
be
regarded
and
that
it
sorted
not
with
the
years
virtues
learning
and
position
of
the
said
most
learned
doctor
to
suppose
that
he
had
spoken
such
words
and
sealed
the
same
with
a
kiss
save
under
the
firm
impression
thought
and
conviction
that
he
was
offering
his
hand
in
marriage
which
said
impression
thought
and
conviction
were
fully
and
reasonably
declared
and
evident
in
his
actions
manner
bearing
air
and
conduct
this
is
very
perplexing
said
duke
deodonato
and
he
knit
his
brows
for
as
he
gazed
upon
the
beauty
of
the
damsel
it
seemed
to
him
a
thing
unnatural
undesirable
unpalatable
unpleasant
and
unendurable
that
she
should
wed
fusbius
yet
if
such
were
the
law
duke
deodonato
sighed
and
he
glanced
at
the
damsel
and
it
chanced
that
the
damsel
glanced
at
duke
deodonato
and
seeing
that
he
was
a
proper
man
and
comely
and
that
his
eye
spoke
his
admiration
of
her
she
blushed
and
her
cheek
that
had
gone
white
when
those
of
the
judges
who
favored
the
learned
doctor
were
speaking
went
red
as
a
rose
again
and
she
strove
to
order
her
hair
and
to
conceal
the
rent
that
was
in
her
robe
and
duke
deodonato
sighed
again
my
lord
he
said
to
the
president
we
have
heard
these
wise
and
erudite
men
and
forasmuch
as
the
matter
is
difficult
they
are
divided
among
themselves
and
the
staff
whereon
we
leant
is
broken
speak
therefore
your
mind
then
the
president
of
the
council
looked
earnestly
at
duke
deodonato
but
the
duke
veiled
his
face
with
his
hand
answer
truly
said
he
without
fear
or
favor
so
shall
you
fulfil
our
pleasure
and
the
president
looking
round
upon
the
company
said
it
is
your
highness
by
all
reasonable
honest
just
proper
and
honorable
intendment
as
good
sound
full
and
explicit
an
offer
of
marriage
as
hath
ever
been
had
in
this
duchy
so
be
it
said
duke
deodonato
and
fusbius
smiled
in
triumph
while
the
maiden
grew
pale
again
and
pursued
the
president
it
binds
controls
and
rules
every
man
woman
and
child
in
these
your
highness
dominions
and
hath
the
force
of
law
over
all
so
be
it
said
deodonato
again
saving
added
the
president
your
highness
only
there
was
a
movement
among
the
company
for
pursued
the
president
by
the
ancient
laws
customs
manners
and
observances
of
the
duchy
no
decree
or
law
shall
in
any
way
whatsoever
impair
alter
lessen
or
derogate
from
the
high
rights
powers
and
prerogatives
of
your
highness
whom
may
heaven
long
preserve
although
therefore
it
be
by
and
pursuant
to
your
highness
decree
the
sure
right
of
every
man
in
this
duchy
to
be
accepted
in
marriage
of
any
damsel
whom
he
shall
invite
thereunto
yet
is
this
right
in
all
respects
subject
to
and
controlled
by
the
natural
legal
inalienable
unalterable
and
sovereign
prerogative
of
your
highness
to
marry
what
damsel
so
ever
it
shall
be
your
pleasure
to
bid
share
your
throne
hence
i
in
obedience
to
your
highness
commands
pronounce
and
declare
that
this
damsel
is
lawfully
and
irrevocably
bound
and
affianced
to
the
learned
fusbius
unless
and
until
it
shall
please
your
highness
yourself
to
demand
her
hand
in
marriage
may
what
i
have
spoken
please
your
highness
and
the
president
sat
down
duke
deodonato
sat
awhile
in
thought
and
there
was
silence
in
the
hall
then
he
spoke
let
all
withdraw
saving
the
damsel
only
and
they
one
and
all
withdrew
and
duke
deodonato
was
left
alone
with
the
damsel
then
he
arose
and
gazed
long
on
the
damsel
but
the
damsel
would
not
look
on
duke
deodonato
how
are
you
called
lady
asked
duke
deodonato
i
am
called
dulcissima
said
she
well
named
said
deodonato
softly
and
he
went
to
the
damsel
and
he
laid
his
hand
full
gently
on
her
robe
and
he
said
dulcissima
you
have
the
prettiest
face
in
all
the
duchy
and
i
will
have
no
wife
but
you
and
duke
deodonato
kissed
the
damsel
the
damsel
forbore
to
strike
duke
deodonato
as
she
had
struck
fusbius
again
her
cheek
went
red
and
again
pale
and
she
said
i
wed
no
man
on
compulsion
madam
i
am
your
sovereign
said
duke
deodonato
and
his
eyes
were
on
the
damsel
if
you
were
an
archangel
cried
the
damsel
our
house
is
not
wont
to
be
scorned
of
ladies
said
deodonato
am
i
crooked
or
baseborn
or
a
fool
this
day
in
your
duchy
women
are
slaves
and
men
their
masters
by
your
will
said
she
it
is
the
order
of
nature
said
deodonato
it
is
not
my
pleasure
said
the
damsel
then
deodonato
laid
his
hand
on
his
silver
bell
for
he
was
very
angry
fusbius
waits
without
said
he
i
will
wed
him
and
kill
him
cried
dulcissima
deodonato
gazed
on
her
you
had
no
chance
of
using
the
pins
said
he
and
the
rent
in
your
gown
is
very
sore
and
upon
this
the
eyes
of
the
damsel
lost
their
fire
and
sought
the
floor
and
she
plucked
at
her
girdle
and
would
not
look
on
deodonato
and
they
said
outside
it
is
very
still
in
the
hall
of
the
duke
then
said
deodonato
dulcissima
what
would
you
that
you
repeal
your
decrees
said
she
deodonato
brow
grew
dark
he
did
not
love
to
go
back
what
i
have
decreed
i
have
decreed
said
he
and
what
i
have
resolved
i
have
resolved
said
she
deodonato
drew
near
to
her
and
if
i
repeal
the
decrees
said
he
you
will
do
well
said
she
and
you
will
wed
whom
i
will
said
she
deodonato
turned
to
the
window
and
for
a
space
he
looked
out
and
the
damsel
smoothed
her
hair
and
drew
her
robe
where
it
was
whole
across
the
rent
and
she
looked
on
deodonato
as
he
stood
and
her
bosom
rose
and
fell
and
she
prayed
a
prayer
that
no
man
heard
or
if
he
heard
might
be
so
base
as
to
tell
but
she
saw
the
dark
locks
of
hair
and
his
form
straight
as
an
arrow
and
tall
as
a
wand
in
the
window
and
again
outside
they
said
it
is
strangely
still
in
the
hall
of
the
duke
then
deodonato
turned
and
he
pressed
with
his
hand
on
the
silver
bell
and
straightway
the
hall
was
filled
with
the
councillors
the
judges
and
the
halberdiers
attentive
to
hear
the
will
of
deodonato
and
the
fate
of
the
damsel
and
the
small
eyes
of
fusbius
glowed
and
the
calm
eyes
of
the
president
smiled
my
cousins
gentlemen
and
my
faithful
guard
said
deodonato
time
which
is
heaven
mighty
instrument
brings
counsel
say
what
the
duke
has
done
shall
any
man
undo
then
cried
they
all
save
one
no
man
and
the
president
said
saving
the
duke
the
decrees
which
i
made
said
deodonato
i
unmake
henceforth
let
men
and
maidens
in
my
duchy
marry
or
not
marry
as
they
will
and
god
give
them
joy
of
it
and
all
save
fusbius
cried
amen
but
fusbius
cried
your
highness
it
is
demonstrated
beyond
cavil
ay
to
the
satisfaction
of
your
highness
this
is
very
tedious
said
deodonato
let
him
speak
no
more
and
again
he
drew
near
to
dulcissima
and
there
before
them
all
he
fell
on
his
knee
and
a
murmur
ran
through
the
hall
madam
said
deodonato
if
you
love
me
wed
me
and
if
you
love
me
not
depart
in
peace
and
in
honor
and
i
deodonato
will
live
my
life
alone
then
the
damsel
trembled
and
barely
did
deodonato
catch
her
words
there
are
many
men
here
said
she
it
is
not
given
to
princes
said
deodonato
to
be
alone
nevertheless
if
you
will
leave
me
alone
and
the
damsel
bent
low
so
that
the
breath
of
her
mouth
stirred
the
hair
on
deodonato
head
and
he
shivered
as
he
knelt
my
prince
and
my
king
said
she
and
deodonato
shot
to
his
feet
and
before
them
all
he
kissed
her
and
turning
spoke
as
i
have
wooed
let
every
man
in
this
duchy
woo
as
i
have
won
let
every
man
that
is
worthy
win
for
unless
he
so
woo
and
unless
he
so
win
vain
is
his
wooing
and
vain
is
his
winning
and
a
fig
for
his
wedding
say
i
deodonato
i
that
was
deodonato
and
now
am
deodonato
and
dulcissima
and
a
great
cheer
rang
out
in
the
hall
and
fusbius
fled
to
the
door
and
they
tore
his
gown
as
he
went
and
cursed
him
for
a
knave
but
the
president
raised
his
voice
aloud
and
cried
may
heaven
preserve
your
highnesses
and
here
a
blessing
on
all
windows
and
that
is
the
reason
why
you
will
find
if
you
travel
there
as
i
trust
you
may
for
nowhere
are
the
ladies
fairer
or
the
men
so
gallant
more
windows
in
the
duchy
of
deodonato
than
anywhere
in
the
wide
world
besides
for
the
more
windows
the
wider
the
view
and
the
wider
the
view
the
more
pretty
damsels
do
you
see
and
the
more
pretty
damsels
you
see
the
more
jocund
a
thing
is
that
is
what
the
men
of
the
duchy
love
and
not
least
duke
deodonato
whom
with
his
bride
dulcissima
may
heaven
long
preserve
