a
foregone
conclusion
by

dean

a
foregone
conclusion
i
as
don
ippolito
passed
down
the
long
narrow
or
footway
leading
from
the
campo
san
stefano
to
the
grand
canal
in
venice
he
peered
anxiously
about
him
now
turning
for
a
backward
look
up
the
calle
where
there
was
no
living
thing
in
sight
but
a
cat
on
a
garden
gate
now
running
a
quick
eye
along
the
palace
walls
that
rose
vast
on
either
hand
and
notched
the
slender
strip
of
blue
sky
visible
overhead
with
the
lines
of
their
jutting
balconies
chimneys
and
cornices
and
now
glancing
toward
the
canal
where
he
could
see
the
noiseless
black
boats
meeting
and
passing
there
was
no
sound
in
the
calle
save
his
own
footfalls
and
the
harsh
scream
of
a
parrot
that
hung
in
the
sunshine
in
one
of
the
loftiest
windows
but
the
note
of
a
peasant
crying
pots
of
pinks
and
roses
in
the
campo
came
softened
to
don
ippolito
s
sense
and
he
heard
the
gondoliers
as
they
hoarsely
jested
together
and
gossiped
with
the
canal
between
them
at
the
next
gondola
station
the
first
tenderness
of
spring
was
in
the
air
though
down
in
that
calle
there
was
yet
enough
of
the
wintry
rawness
to
chill
the
tip
of
don
ippolito
s
sensitive
nose
which
he
rubbed
for
comfort
with
a
handkerchief
of
dark
blue
calico
and
polished
for
ornament
with
a
handkerchief
of
white
linen
he
restored
each
to
a
different
pocket
in
the
sides
of
the
ecclesiastical
or
gown
reaching
almost
to
his
ankles
and
then
clutched
the
pocket
in
which
he
had
replaced
the
linen
handkerchief
as
if
to
make
sure
that
something
he
prized
was
safe
within
he
paused
abruptly
and
looking
at
the
doors
he
had
passed
went
back
a
few
paces
and
stood
before
one
over
which
hung
slightly
tilted
forward
an
oval
sign
painted
with
the
effigy
of
an
eagle
a
bundle
of
arrows
and
certain
thunderbolts
and
bearing
the
legend
consulate
of
the
united
states
in
neat
characters
don
ippolito
gave
a
quick
sigh
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
seized
the
and
jerked
it
so
sharply
that
it
seemed
to
thrust
out
like
a
part
of
the
mechanism
the
head
of
an
old
at
the
window
above
him
who
is
there
demanded
this
head
friends
answered
don
ippolito
in
a
rich
sad
voice
and
what
do
you
command
further
asked
the
old
woman
don
ippolito
paused
apparently
searching
for
his
voice
before
he
inquired
is
it
here
that
the
consul
of
america
lives
is
he
perhaps
at
home
i
don
t
know
i
will
go
ask
do
me
that
pleasure
dear
said
don
ippolito
and
remained
knotting
his
fingers
before
the
closed
door
presently
the
old
woman
returned
and
looking
out
long
enough
to
say
the
consul
is
at
home
drew
some
inner
bolt
by
a
wire
running
to
the
lock
that
let
the
door
start
open
then
waiting
to
hear
don
ippolito
close
it
again
she
called
out
from
her
height
favor
me
he
climbed
the
dim
stairway
to
the
point
where
she
stood
and
followed
her
to
a
door
which
she
flung
open
into
an
apartment
so
brightly
lit
by
a
window
looking
on
the
sunny
canal
that
he
blinked
as
he
entered
signor
console
said
the
old
woman
behold
the
gentleman
who
desired
to
see
you
and
at
the
same
time
don
ippolito
having
removed
his
broad
stiff
hat
came
forward
and
made
a
beautiful
bow
he
had
lost
for
the
moment
the
trepidation
which
had
marked
his
approach
to
the
consulate
and
bore
himself
with
graceful
dignity
it
was
in
the
first
year
of
the
war
and
from
a
motive
of
patriotism
common
at
that
time
ferris
one
of
my
many
predecessors
in
office
at
venice
had
just
been
crossing
his
two
silken
gondola
flags
above
the
consular
bookcase
where
with
their
gilt
staves
and
their
vivid
stars
and
stripes
they
made
a
very
pretty
effect
he
filliped
a
little
dust
from
his
coat
and
begged
don
ippolito
to
be
seated
with
the
air
of
putting
even
a
venetian
priest
on
a
footing
of
equality
with
other
men
under
the
folds
of
the
national
banner
ferris
had
the
prejudice
of
all
italian
sympathizers
against
the
priests
but
for
this
he
could
hardly
have
found
anything
in
don
ippolito
to
alarm
dislike
his
face
was
a
little
thin
and
the
chin
was
delicate
the
nose
had
a
fine
dantesque
curve
but
its
final
droop
gave
a
melancholy
cast
to
a
countenance
expressive
of
a
gentle
and
kindly
spirit
the
eyes
were
large
and
dark
and
full
of
a
dreamy
warmth
don
ippolito
s
prevailing
tint
was
that
transparent
blueishness
which
comes
from
much
shaving
of
a
heavy
black
beard
his
forehead
and
temples
were
marble
white
he
had
a
tonsure
the
size
of
a
dollar
he
sat
silent
for
a
little
space
and
softly
questioned
the
consul
s
face
with
his
dreamy
eyes
apparently
he
could
not
gather
courage
to
speak
of
his
business
at
once
for
he
turned
his
gaze
upon
the
window
and
said
a
beautiful
position
signor
yes
it
s
a
pretty
place
answered
ferris
warily
so
much
pleasanter
here
on
the
canalazzo
than
on
the
campos
or
the
little
oh
without
here
there
must
be
constant
amusement
in
watching
the
boats
great
stir
great
variety
great
life
and
now
the
fine
season
commences
and
the
signor
console
s
countrymen
will
be
coming
to
venice
perhaps
added
don
ippolito
with
a
polite
dismay
and
an
air
of
sudden
anxiety
to
escape
from
his
own
purpose
i
may
be
disturbing
or
detaining
the
signor
console
no
said
ferris
i
am
quite
at
leisure
for
the
present
in
what
can
i
have
the
honor
of
serving
you
don
ippolito
heaved
a
long
ineffectual
sigh
and
taking
his
linen
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
wiped
his
forehead
with
it
and
rolled
it
upon
his
knee
he
looked
at
the
door
and
all
round
the
room
and
then
rose
and
drew
near
the
consul
who
had
officially
seated
himself
at
his
desk
i
suppose
that
the
signor
console
gives
passports
he
asked
sometimes
replied
ferris
with
a
clouding
face
don
ippolito
seemed
to
note
the
gathering
distrust
and
to
be
helpless
against
it
he
continued
hastily
could
the
signor
console
give
a
passport
for
america
to
me
are
you
an
american
citizen
demanded
the
consul
in
the
voice
of
a
man
whose
suspicions
are
fully
roused
american
citizen
yes
subject
of
the
american
no
surely
i
have
not
that
happiness
i
am
an
austrian
subject
returned
don
ippolito
a
little
bitterly
as
if
the
last
words
were
an
unpleasant
morsel
in
the
mouth
then
i
can
t
give
you
a
passport
said
ferris
somewhat
more
gently
you
know
he
explained
that
no
government
can
give
passports
to
foreign
subjects
that
would
be
an
but
i
thought
that
to
go
to
america
an
american
passport
would
be
in
america
returned
the
consul
with
proud
compassion
they
don
t
care
a
fig
for
passports
you
go
and
you
come
and
nobody
meddles
to
be
sure
he
faltered
just
now
on
account
of
the
secessionists
they
require
you
to
show
a
passport
at
new
york
but
he
continued
more
boldly
american
passports
are
usually
for
europe
and
besides
all
the
american
passports
in
the
world
wouldn
t
get
over
the
frontier
at
peschiera
must
have
a
passport
from
the
austrian
lieutenancy
of
don
ippolito
nodded
his
head
softly
several
times
and
said
precisely
and
then
added
with
an
indescribable
weariness
patience
signor
console
i
ask
your
pardon
for
the
trouble
i
have
given
and
he
made
the
consul
another
low
bow
whether
ferris
s
curiosity
was
piqued
and
feeling
himself
on
the
safe
side
of
his
visitor
he
meant
to
know
why
he
had
come
on
such
an
errand
or
whether
he
had
some
kindlier
motive
he
could
hardly
have
told
himself
but
he
said
i
m
very
sorry
perhaps
there
is
something
else
in
which
i
could
be
of
use
to
ah
i
hardly
know
cried
don
ippolito
i
really
had
a
kind
of
hope
in
coming
to
your
i
am
not
an
excellency
interrupted
ferris
conscientiously
many
excuses
but
now
it
seems
a
mere
bestiality
i
was
so
ignorant
about
the
other
matter
that
doubtless
i
am
also
quite
deluded
in
as
to
that
of
course
i
can
t
say
answered
ferris
but
i
hope
why
listen
signore
said
don
ippolito
placing
his
hand
over
that
pocket
in
which
he
kept
his
linen
handkerchief
i
had
something
that
it
had
come
into
my
head
to
offer
your
honored
government
for
its
advantage
in
this
deplorable
oh
responded
ferris
with
a
falling
countenance
he
had
received
so
many
offers
of
help
for
his
honored
government
from
sympathizing
foreigners
hardly
a
week
passed
but
a
sabre
came
clanking
up
his
dim
staircase
with
a
herr
graf
or
a
herr
baron
attached
who
appeared
in
the
spotless
panoply
of
his
austrian
captaincy
or
lieutenancy
to
accept
from
the
consul
a
in
the
federal
armies
on
condition
that
the
consul
would
pay
his
expenses
to
washington
or
at
least
assure
him
of
an
exalted
post
and
reimbursement
of
all
outlays
from
president
lincoln
as
soon
as
he
arrived
they
were
beautiful
men
with
the
complexion
of
blonde
girls
their
uniforms
fitted
like
kid
gloves
the
pale
blue
or
pure
white
or
huzzar
black
of
their
coats
was
ravishingly
set
off
by
their
red
or
gold
trimmings
and
they
were
hard
to
make
understand
that
brigadiers
of
american
birth
swarmed
at
washington
and
that
if
they
went
thither
they
must
go
as
soldiers
of
fortune
at
their
own
risk
but
they
were
very
polite
they
begged
pardon
when
they
knocked
their
scabbards
against
the
consul
s
furniture
at
the
door
they
each
made
him
a
magnificent
obeisance
said
servus
in
their
great
voices
and
were
shown
out
by
the
old
marina
abhorrent
of
their
uniforms
and
doubtful
of
the
consul
s
political
sympathies
only
yesterday
she
had
called
him
up
at
an
unwonted
hour
to
receive
the
visit
of
a
courtly
gentleman
who
addressed
him
as
monsieur
le
ministre
and
offered
him
at
a
bargain
ten
thousand
stand
of
probably
obsolescent
muskets
belonging
to
the
late
duke
of
parma
shabby
hungry
incapable
exiles
of
all
nations
religions
and
politics
beset
him
for
places
of
honor
and
emolument
in
the
service
of
the
union
revolutionists
out
of
business
and
the
minions
of
banished
despots
were
alike
willing
to
be
fed
clothed
and
dispatched
to
washington
with
swords
consecrated
to
the
perpetuity
of
the
republic
i
have
here
said
don
ippolito
too
intent
upon
showing
whatever
it
was
he
had
to
note
the
change
in
the
consul
s
mood
the
model
of
a
weapon
of
my
contrivance
which
i
thought
the
government
of
the
north
could
employ
successfully
in
cases
where
its
batteries
were
in
danger
of
capture
by
the
spaniards
spaniards
we
have
no
war
with
spain
cried
the
consul
yes
yes
i
know
don
ippolito
made
haste
to
explain
but
those
of
south
america
being
spanish
by
descent
but
we
are
not
fighting
the
south
americans
we
are
fighting
our
own
southern
states
i
am
sorry
to
oh
many
excuses
i
am
afraid
i
don
t
understand
said
don
ippolito
meekly
whereupon
ferris
enlightened
him
in
a
formula
of
which
he
was
beginning
to
be
weary
against
european
misconception
of
the
american
situation
don
ippolito
nodded
his
head
contritely
and
when
ferris
had
ended
he
was
so
much
abashed
that
he
made
no
motion
to
show
his
invention
till
the
other
added
but
no
matter
i
suppose
the
contrivance
would
work
as
well
against
the
southerners
as
the
south
americans
let
me
see
it
please
and
then
don
ippolito
with
a
gratified
smile
drew
from
his
pocket
the
neatly
finished
model
of
a
cannon
you
perceive
signor
console
he
said
with
new
dignity
that
this
is
nothing
very
new
as
a
though
i
ask
you
to
observe
this
little
improvement
for
restoring
the
breech
to
its
place
which
is
original
the
grand
feature
of
my
invention
however
is
this
secret
chamber
in
the
breech
which
is
intended
to
hold
an
explosive
of
high
potency
with
a
fuse
coming
out
below
the
gunner
finding
his
piece
in
danger
ignites
this
fuse
and
takes
refuge
in
flight
at
the
moment
the
enemy
seizes
the
gun
the
contents
of
the
secret
chamber
explode
demolishing
the
piece
and
destroying
its
the
dreamy
warmth
in
don
ippolito
s
deep
eyes
kindled
to
a
flame
a
dark
red
glowed
in
his
thin
cheeks
he
drew
a
box
from
the
folds
of
his
drapery
and
took
snuff
in
a
great
whiff
as
if
inhaling
the
sulphurous
fumes
of
battle
or
titillating
his
nostrils
with
grains
of
gunpowder
he
was
at
least
in
full
enjoyment
of
the
poetic
power
of
his
invention
and
no
doubt
had
before
his
eyes
a
vivid
picture
of
a
score
of
secessionists
surprised
and
blown
to
atoms
in
the
very
moment
of
triumph
behold
signor
console
he
said
it
s
certainly
very
curious
said
ferris
turning
the
fearful
toy
over
in
his
hand
and
admiring
the
neat
workmanship
of
it
did
you
make
this
model
yourself
surely
answered
the
priest
with
a
joyous
pride
i
have
no
money
to
spend
upon
artisans
and
besides
as
you
might
infer
signore
i
am
not
very
well
seen
by
my
superiors
and
associates
on
account
of
these
little
amusements
of
mine
so
keep
them
as
much
as
i
can
to
don
ippolito
laughed
nervously
and
then
fell
silent
with
his
eyes
intent
upon
the
consul
s
face
what
do
you
think
signore
he
presently
resumed
if
this
invention
were
brought
to
the
notice
of
your
generous
government
would
it
not
patronize
my
labors
i
have
read
that
america
is
the
land
of
enterprises
who
knows
but
your
government
might
invite
me
to
take
service
under
it
in
some
capacity
in
which
i
could
employ
those
little
gifts
that
heaven
he
paused
again
apparently
puzzled
by
the
compassionate
smile
on
the
consul
s
lips
but
tell
me
signore
how
this
invention
appears
to
have
you
had
any
practical
experience
in
gunnery
asked
ferris
why
certainly
neither
have
i
continued
ferris
but
i
was
wondering
whether
the
explosive
in
this
secret
chamber
would
not
become
so
heated
by
the
frequent
discharges
of
the
piece
as
to
go
off
prematurely
sometimes
and
kill
our
own
artillerymen
instead
of
waiting
for
the
secessionists
don
ippolito
s
countenance
fell
and
a
dull
shame
displaced
the
exultation
that
had
glowed
in
it
his
head
sunk
on
his
breast
and
he
made
no
attempt
at
reply
so
that
it
was
again
ferris
who
spoke
you
see
i
don
t
really
know
anything
more
of
the
matter
than
you
do
and
i
don
t
undertake
to
say
whether
your
invention
is
disabled
by
the
possibility
i
suggest
or
not
haven
t
you
any
acquaintances
among
the
military
to
whom
you
could
show
your
model
no
answered
don
ippolito
coldly
i
don
t
consort
with
the
military
besides
what
would
be
thought
of
a
he
asked
with
a
bitter
stress
on
the
word
who
exhibited
such
an
invention
as
that
to
an
officer
of
our
paternal
government
i
suppose
it
would
certainly
surprise
the
somewhat
said
ferris
with
a
laugh
may
i
ask
he
pursued
after
an
interval
whether
you
have
occupied
yourself
with
other
inventions
i
have
attempted
a
great
many
replied
don
ippolito
in
a
tone
of
dejection
are
they
all
of
this
warlike
temper
pursued
the
consul
no
said
don
ippolito
blushing
a
little
they
are
nearly
all
of
peaceful
intention
it
was
the
wish
to
produce
something
of
utility
which
set
me
about
this
cannon
those
good
friends
of
mine
who
have
done
me
the
honor
of
looking
at
my
attempts
had
blamed
me
for
the
uselessness
of
my
inventions
they
allowed
that
they
were
ingenious
but
they
said
that
even
if
they
could
be
put
in
operation
they
would
not
be
what
the
world
cared
for
perhaps
they
were
right
i
know
very
little
of
the
world
concluded
the
priest
sadly
he
had
risen
to
go
yet
seemed
not
quite
able
to
do
so
there
was
no
more
to
say
but
if
he
had
come
to
the
consul
with
high
hopes
it
might
well
have
unnerved
him
to
have
all
end
so
blankly
he
drew
a
long
sibilant
breath
between
his
shut
teeth
nodded
to
himself
thrice
and
turning
to
ferris
with
a
melancholy
bow
said
signor
console
i
thank
you
infinitely
for
your
kindness
i
beg
your
pardon
for
the
disturbance
and
i
take
my
i
am
sorry
said
ferris
let
us
see
each
other
again
in
regard
to
the
inventions
well
you
must
have
he
dropped
into
some
proverbial
phrases
which
the
obliging
latin
tongues
supply
so
abundantly
for
the
races
who
must
often
talk
when
they
do
not
feel
like
thinking
and
he
gave
a
start
when
don
ippolito
replied
in
english
yes
but
hope
deferred
maketh
the
heart
it
was
not
that
it
was
so
uncommon
to
have
italians
innocently
come
out
with
their
whole
slender
stock
of
english
to
him
for
the
sake
of
practice
as
they
told
him
but
there
were
peculiarities
in
don
ippolito
s
accent
for
which
he
could
not
account
what
he
exclaimed
do
you
know
english
i
have
studied
it
a
little
by
myself
answered
don
ippolito
pleased
to
have
his
english
recognized
and
then
lapsing
into
the
safety
of
italian
he
added
and
i
had
also
the
help
of
an
english
ecclesiastic
who
sojourned
some
months
in
venice
last
year
for
his
health
and
who
used
to
read
with
me
and
teach
me
the
pronunciation
he
was
from
dublin
this
oh
said
ferris
with
relief
i
see
and
he
perceived
that
what
had
puzzled
him
in
don
ippolito
s
english
was
a
fine
brogue
superimposed
upon
his
italian
accent
for
some
time
i
have
had
this
idea
of
going
to
america
and
i
thought
that
the
first
thing
to
do
was
to
equip
myself
with
the
um
said
ferris
that
was
practical
at
any
rate
and
he
mused
awhile
by
and
by
he
continued
more
kindly
than
he
had
yet
spoken
i
wish
i
could
ask
you
to
sit
down
again
but
i
have
an
engagement
which
i
must
make
haste
to
keep
are
you
going
out
through
the
campo
pray
wait
a
minute
and
i
will
walk
with
ferris
went
into
another
room
through
the
open
door
of
which
don
ippolito
saw
the
paraphernalia
of
a
painter
s
studio
an
easel
with
a
picture
on
it
a
chair
with
a
palette
and
brushes
and
crushed
and
twisted
tubes
of
colors
a
lay
figure
in
one
corner
on
the
walls
scraps
of
stamped
leather
rags
of
tapestry
desultory
sketches
on
paper
ferris
came
out
again
brushing
his
hat
the
signor
console
amuses
himself
with
painting
i
see
said
don
ippolito
courteously
not
at
all
replied
ferris
putting
on
his
gloves
i
am
a
painter
by
profession
and
i
amuse
myself
with
consuling
footnote
since
these
words
of
ferris
were
first
printed
i
have
been
told
that
a
more
eminent
painter
namely
rubens
made
very
much
the
same
reply
to
very
much
the
same
remark
when
spanish
ambassador
in
england
the
ambassador
of
his
catholic
majesty
i
see
amuses
himself
by
painting
sometimes
said
a
visitor
who
found
him
at
his
easel
i
amuse
myself
by
playing
the
ambassador
sometimes
answered
rubens
in
spite
of
the
similarity
of
the
speeches
i
let
that
of
ferris
stand
for
i
am
satisfied
that
he
did
not
know
how
unhandsomely
rubens
had
taken
the
words
out
of
his
mouth
and
as
so
open
a
matter
needed
no
explanation
he
said
no
more
about
it
nor
is
it
quite
necessary
to
tell
how
as
he
was
one
day
painting
in
new
york
it
occurred
to
him
to
make
use
of
a
congressional
friend
and
ask
for
some
italian
consulate
he
did
not
care
which
that
of
venice
happened
to
be
vacant
the
income
was
a
few
hundred
dollars
as
no
one
else
wanted
it
no
question
was
made
of
ferris
s
fitness
for
the
post
and
he
presently
found
himself
possessed
of
a
commission
requesting
the
emperor
of
austria
to
permit
him
to
enjoy
and
exercise
the
office
of
consul
of
the
ports
of
the
kingdom
to
which
the
president
of
the
united
states
appointed
him
from
a
special
trust
in
his
abilities
and
integrity
he
proceeded
at
once
to
his
post
of
duty
called
upon
the
ship
s
chandler
with
whom
they
had
been
left
for
the
consular
archives
and
began
to
paint
some
venetian
subjects
he
and
don
ippolito
quitted
the
consulate
together
leaving
marina
to
digest
with
her
noonday
porridge
the
wonder
that
he
should
be
walking
amicably
forth
with
a
priest
the
same
spectacle
was
presented
to
the
gaze
of
the
campo
where
they
paused
in
friendly
converse
and
were
seen
to
part
with
many
politenesses
by
the
doctors
of
the
neighborhood
lounging
away
their
leisure
as
the
venetian
fashion
is
at
the
local
pharmacy
the
apothecary
craned
forward
over
his
counter
and
peered
through
the
open
door
what
is
that
blessed
consul
of
america
doing
with
a
priest
the
consul
of
america
with
a
priest
demanded
a
grave
old
man
a
physician
with
a
beautiful
silvery
beard
and
a
most
reverend
and
senatorial
presence
but
one
of
the
worst
tongues
in
venice
oh
he
added
with
a
laugh
after
scrutiny
of
the
two
through
his
glasses
it
s
that
don
ippolito
rondinelli
he
isn
t
priest
enough
to
hurt
the
consul
perhaps
he
s
been
selling
him
a
perpetual
motion
for
the
use
of
his
government
which
needs
something
of
the
kind
just
now
or
maybe
he
s
been
posing
to
him
for
a
picture
he
would
make
a
very
pretty
joseph
give
him
potiphar
s
wife
in
the
background
said
the
doctor
who
if
not
maligned
would
have
needed
much
more
to
make
a
joseph
of
him
ii
ferris
took
his
way
through
the
devious
footways
where
the
shadow
was
chill
and
through
the
broad
campos
where
the
sun
was
tenderly
warm
and
the
towers
of
the
church
rose
against
the
azure
of
the
vernal
heaven
as
he
went
along
he
frowned
in
a
helpless
perplexity
with
the
case
of
don
ippolito
whom
he
had
begun
by
doubting
for
a
spy
with
some
incomprehensible
motive
and
had
ended
by
pitying
with
a
certain
degree
of
amusement
and
a
deep
sense
of
the
futility
of
his
compassion
he
presently
began
to
think
of
him
with
a
little
disgust
as
people
commonly
think
of
one
whom
they
pity
and
yet
can
not
help
and
he
made
haste
to
cast
off
the
hopeless
burden
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
struck
his
stick
on
the
smooth
and
let
his
eyes
rove
up
and
down
the
fronts
of
the
houses
for
the
sake
of
the
pretty
faces
that
glanced
out
of
the
casements
he
was
a
young
man
and
it
was
spring
and
this
was
venice
he
made
himself
joyfully
part
of
the
city
and
the
season
he
was
glad
of
the
narrowness
of
the
streets
of
the
jostling
and
pushing
he
crouched
into
an
arched
doorway
to
let
a
pass
with
her
copper
buckets
dripping
at
the
end
of
the
yoke
balanced
on
her
shoulder
and
he
returned
her
smiles
and
excuses
with
others
as
broad
and
gay
he
brushed
by
the
swelling
hoops
of
ladies
and
stooped
before
the
unwieldy
burdens
of
porters
who
as
they
staggered
through
the
crowd
with
a
thrust
hero
and
a
shove
there
forgave
themselves
laughing
with
we
are
in
venice
signori
and
he
stood
aside
for
the
files
of
soldiers
clanking
heavily
over
the
pavement
then
muskets
kindling
to
a
blaze
in
the
sunlit
campos
and
quenched
again
in
the
damp
shadows
of
the
calles
his
ear
was
taken
by
the
vibrant
jargoning
of
the
boatmen
as
they
pushed
their
craft
under
the
bridges
he
crossed
and
the
keen
notes
of
the
canaries
and
the
songs
of
the
blackbirds
whose
cages
hung
at
lattices
far
overhead
heaps
of
oranges
topped
by
the
fairest
cut
in
halves
gave
their
color
at
frequent
intervals
to
the
dusky
corners
and
recesses
and
the
cry
of
the
venders
oranges
of
palermo
rose
above
the
clatter
of
feet
and
the
clamor
of
other
voices
at
a
little
shop
where
butter
and
eggs
and
milk
abounded
together
with
early
flowers
of
various
sorts
he
bought
a
bunch
of
hyacinths
blue
and
white
and
yellow
and
he
presently
stood
smelling
these
while
he
waited
in
the
hotel
parlor
for
the
ladies
to
whom
he
had
sent
his
card
he
turned
at
the
sound
of
drifting
drapery
and
could
not
forbear
placing
the
hyacinths
in
the
hand
of
miss
florida
vervain
who
had
come
into
the
room
to
receive
him
she
was
a
girl
of
about
seventeen
years
who
looked
older
she
was
tall
rather
than
short
and
rather
full
though
it
could
not
be
said
that
she
erred
in
point
of
solidity
in
the
attitudes
of
shy
hauteur
into
which
she
constantly
fell
there
was
a
touch
of
defiant
awkwardness
which
had
a
certain
fascination
she
was
blonde
with
a
throat
and
hands
of
milky
whiteness
there
was
a
suggestion
of
freckles
on
her
regular
face
where
a
quick
color
came
and
went
though
her
cheeks
were
habitually
somewhat
pale
her
eyes
were
very
blue
under
their
level
brows
and
the
lashes
were
even
lighter
in
color
than
the
masses
of
her
fair
gold
hair
the
edges
of
the
lids
were
touched
with
the
faintest
red
the
late
colonel
vervain
of
the
united
states
army
whose
complexion
his
daughter
had
inherited
was
an
officer
whom
it
would
not
have
been
peaceable
to
cross
in
any
purpose
or
pleasure
and
miss
vervain
seemed
sometimes
a
little
burdened
by
the
passionate
nature
which
he
had
left
her
together
with
the
tropical
name
he
had
bestowed
in
honor
of
the
state
where
he
had
fought
the
seminoles
in
his
youth
and
where
he
chanced
still
to
be
stationed
when
she
was
born
she
had
the
air
of
being
embarrassed
in
presence
of
herself
and
of
having
an
anxious
watch
upon
her
impulses
i
do
not
know
how
otherwise
to
describe
the
effort
of
proud
helpless
femininity
which
would
have
struck
the
close
observer
in
miss
vervain
delicious
she
said
in
a
deep
voice
which
conveyed
something
of
this
anxiety
in
its
guarded
tones
and
yet
was
not
wanting
in
a
kind
of
frankness
did
you
mean
them
for
me
ferris
i
didn
t
but
i
do
answered
ferris
i
bought
them
in
ignorance
but
i
understand
now
what
they
were
meant
for
by
nature
and
in
fact
the
hyacinths
with
their
smooth
textures
and
their
pure
colors
harmonized
well
with
miss
vervain
as
she
bent
her
face
over
them
and
inhaled
their
full
rich
perfume
i
will
put
them
in
water
she
said
if
you
ll
excuse
me
a
moment
mother
will
be
down
before
she
could
return
her
mother
rustled
into
the
parlor
vervain
was
gracefully
fragilely
unlike
her
daughter
she
entered
with
a
gentle
and
gliding
step
peering
about
through
her
glasses
and
laughing
triumphantly
when
she
had
determined
ferris
s
exact
position
where
he
stood
with
a
smile
shaping
his
full
brown
beard
and
glancing
from
his
hazel
eyes
she
was
dressed
in
perfect
taste
with
reference
to
her
matronly
years
and
the
lingering
evidences
of
her
widowhood
and
she
had
an
unaffected
naturalness
of
manner
which
even
at
her
age
of
could
not
be
called
less
than
charming
she
spoke
in
a
trusting
caressing
tone
to
which
no
man
at
least
could
respond
unkindly
so
very
good
of
you
to
take
all
this
trouble
ferris
she
said
giving
him
a
friendly
hand
and
i
suppose
you
are
letting
us
encroach
upon
very
valuable
time
i
m
quite
ashamed
to
take
it
but
isn
t
it
a
heavenly
day
what
call
a
perfect
day
just
right
every
way
none
of
those
disagreeable
extremes
it
s
so
unpleasant
to
have
it
too
hot
for
instance
i
m
the
greatest
person
for
moderation
ferris
and
i
carry
the
principle
into
everything
but
i
do
think
the
breakfasts
at
these
italian
hotels
are
too
light
altogether
i
like
our
american
breakfasts
don
t
you
i
ve
been
telling
florida
i
can
t
stand
it
we
really
must
make
some
arrangement
to
be
sure
you
oughtn
t
to
think
of
such
a
thing
as
eating
in
a
place
like
venice
all
poetry
but
a
sound
mind
in
a
sound
body
say
we
re
perfectly
wild
over
it
don
t
you
think
it
s
a
place
that
grows
upon
you
very
much
ferris
all
those
associations
it
does
seem
too
much
and
the
gondolas
everywhere
but
i
m
always
afraid
the
gondoliers
cheat
us
and
in
the
stores
i
never
feel
safe
a
moment
not
a
moment
i
do
think
the
venetians
are
lacking
in
truthfulness
a
little
i
don
t
believe
they
understand
our
american
fairdealing
and
sincerity
i
shouldn
t
want
to
do
them
injustice
but
i
really
think
they
take
advantages
in
bargaining
now
such
a
thing
even
as
corals
florida
is
extremely
fond
of
them
and
we
bought
a
set
yesterday
in
the
piazza
and
i
we
paid
too
much
for
them
florida
said
vervain
for
her
daughter
had
reentered
the
room
and
stood
with
some
shawls
and
wraps
upon
her
arm
patiently
waiting
for
the
conclusion
of
the
elder
lady
s
speech
i
wish
you
would
bring
down
that
set
of
corals
i
d
like
ferris
to
give
an
unbiased
opinion
i
m
sure
we
were
i
don
t
know
anything
about
corals
vervain
interposed
ferris
well
but
you
ought
to
see
this
set
for
the
beauty
of
the
color
they
re
really
exquisite
i
m
sure
it
will
gratify
your
artistic
miss
vervain
hesitated
with
a
look
of
desire
to
obey
and
of
doubt
whether
to
force
the
pleasure
upon
ferris
won
t
it
do
another
time
mother
she
asked
faintly
the
gondola
is
waiting
for
vervain
gave
a
frailish
start
from
the
chair
into
which
she
had
sunk
oh
do
let
us
be
off
at
once
then
she
said
and
when
they
stood
on
the
of
the
hotel
what
gloomy
things
these
gondolas
are
she
added
while
the
gondolier
with
one
foot
on
the
gunwale
of
the
boat
received
the
ladies
shawls
and
then
crooked
his
arm
for
them
to
rest
a
hand
on
in
stepping
aboard
i
wonder
they
don
t
paint
them
some
cheerful
blue
or
pink
vervain
asked
ferris
i
knew
you
were
coming
to
that
question
they
all
do
but
we
needn
t
have
the
top
on
at
all
if
it
depresses
your
spirits
we
shall
be
just
warm
enough
in
the
open
well
have
it
off
then
it
sends
the
cold
chills
over
me
to
look
at
it
what
byron
call
it
yes
it
s
time
for
byron
now
it
was
very
good
of
you
not
to
mention
him
before
vervain
but
i
knew
he
had
to
come
he
called
it
a
coffin
clapped
in
a
exactly
said
vervain
i
always
feel
as
if
i
were
going
to
my
own
funeral
when
i
get
into
it
and
i
ve
certainly
had
enough
of
funerals
never
to
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
another
as
long
as
i
she
settled
herself
luxuriously
upon
the
leathern
cushions
when
the
cabin
was
removed
death
had
indeed
been
near
her
very
often
father
and
mother
had
been
early
lost
to
her
and
the
brothers
and
sisters
orphaned
with
her
had
faded
and
perished
one
after
another
as
they
ripened
to
men
and
women
she
had
seen
four
of
her
own
children
die
her
husband
had
been
dead
six
years
all
these
bereavements
had
left
her
what
they
had
found
her
she
had
truly
grieved
and
as
she
said
she
had
hardly
ever
been
out
of
black
since
she
could
remember
i
never
was
in
colors
when
i
was
a
girl
she
went
on
indulging
many
obituary
memories
as
the
gondola
dipped
and
darted
down
the
canal
and
i
was
married
in
my
mourning
for
my
last
sister
it
did
seem
a
little
too
much
when
she
went
ferris
i
was
too
young
to
feel
it
so
much
about
the
others
but
we
were
nearly
of
the
same
age
and
that
makes
a
difference
don
t
you
know
first
a
brother
and
then
a
sister
it
was
very
strange
how
they
kept
going
that
way
i
seemed
to
break
the
charm
when
i
got
married
though
to
be
sure
there
was
no
brother
left
after
miss
vervain
heard
her
mother
s
mortuary
prattle
with
a
face
from
which
no
impatience
of
it
could
be
inferred
and
ferris
made
no
comment
on
what
was
oddly
various
in
character
and
manner
for
vervain
touched
upon
the
gloomiest
facts
of
her
history
with
a
certain
impersonal
statistical
interest
they
were
rowing
across
the
lagoon
to
the
island
of
san
lazzaro
where
for
reasons
of
her
own
she
intended
to
venerate
the
convent
in
which
byron
studied
the
armenian
language
preparatory
to
writing
his
great
poem
in
it
if
her
pilgrimage
had
no
very
earnest
motive
it
was
worthy
of
the
fact
which
it
was
designed
to
honor
the
lagoon
was
of
a
perfect
shining
smoothness
broken
by
the
shallows
over
which
the
ebbing
tide
had
left
the
trailed
like
long
disheveled
hair
the
fishermen
as
they
waded
about
staking
their
nets
or
stooped
to
gather
the
small
of
the
shallows
showed
legs
as
brown
and
tough
as
those
of
the
apostles
in
titian
s
assumption
here
and
there
was
a
boat
with
a
boy
or
an
old
man
asleep
in
the
bottom
of
it
the
gulls
sailed
high
white
flakes
against
the
illimitable
blue
of
the
heavens
the
air
though
it
was
of
early
spring
and
in
the
shade
had
a
salty
pungency
was
here
almost
languorously
warm
in
the
motionless
splendors
and
rich
colors
of
the
scene
there
was
a
melancholy
before
which
vervain
fell
fitfully
silent
now
and
then
ferris
briefly
spoke
calling
miss
vervain
s
notice
to
this
or
that
and
she
briefly
responded
as
they
passed
the
of
san
servolo
a
maniac
standing
at
an
open
window
took
his
black
velvet
from
his
white
hair
bowed
low
three
times
and
kissed
his
hand
to
the
ladies
the
lido
in
front
of
them
stretched
a
brown
strip
of
sand
with
white
villages
shining
out
of
it
on
their
left
the
public
gardens
showed
a
mass
of
hovering
green
far
beyond
and
above
the
ghostlike
snows
of
the
alpine
heights
haunted
the
misty
horizon
it
was
chill
in
the
shadow
of
the
convent
when
they
landed
at
san
lazzaro
and
it
was
cool
in
the
parlor
where
they
waited
for
the
monk
who
was
to
show
them
through
the
place
but
it
was
still
and
warm
in
the
gardened
court
where
the
bees
murmured
among
the
crocuses
and
hyacinths
under
the
noonday
sun
miss
vervain
stood
looking
out
of
the
window
upon
the
lagoon
while
her
mother
drifted
about
the
room
peering
at
the
objects
on
the
wall
through
her
eyeglasses
she
was
praising
a
chinese
painting
of
fish
on
when
a
young
monk
entered
with
a
cordial
greeting
in
english
for
ferris
she
turned
and
saw
them
shaking
hands
but
at
the
same
moment
her
eyeglasses
abandoned
her
nose
with
a
vigorous
leap
she
gave
an
amiable
laugh
and
groping
for
them
over
her
dress
bowed
at
random
as
ferris
presented
padre
girolamo
i
ve
been
admiring
this
painting
so
much
padre
girolamo
she
said
with
instant
and
taking
the
monk
into
the
easy
familiarity
of
her
friendship
by
the
tone
with
which
she
spoke
his
name
some
of
the
brothers
did
it
i
oh
no
said
the
monk
it
s
a
chinese
painting
we
hung
it
up
there
because
it
was
given
to
us
and
was
well
now
do
you
know
returned
vervain
i
it
was
chinese
their
things
so
odd
but
really
in
an
armenian
convent
it
s
very
misleading
i
don
t
think
you
ought
to
leave
it
there
it
certainly
does
throw
people
off
the
track
she
added
subduing
the
expression
to
something
very
by
the
winning
appeal
with
which
she
used
it
oh
but
if
they
put
up
armenian
paintings
in
chinese
convents
said
ferris
you
re
joking
cried
vervain
looking
at
him
with
a
graciously
amused
air
there
no
chinese
convents
to
be
sure
those
rebels
are
a
kind
of
christians
she
added
thoughtfully
but
there
can
t
be
many
of
them
left
poor
things
hundreds
of
them
executed
at
a
time
that
way
it
s
perfectly
sickening
to
read
of
it
and
you
can
t
help
it
you
know
but
they
say
they
haven
t
really
so
much
feeling
as
we
have
not
so
she
walked
by
the
side
of
the
young
friar
as
he
led
the
way
to
such
parts
of
the
convent
as
are
open
to
visitors
and
ferris
came
after
with
her
daughter
who
he
fancied
met
his
attempts
at
talk
with
sudden
and
more
than
usual
hauteur
what
a
fool
he
said
to
himself
is
she
afraid
i
shall
be
wanting
to
make
love
to
her
and
he
followed
in
rather
a
sulky
silence
the
course
of
vervain
and
her
guide
the
library
the
chapel
and
the
museum
called
out
her
friendliest
praises
and
in
the
last
she
praised
the
mummy
on
show
there
at
the
expense
of
one
she
had
seen
in
new
york
but
when
padre
girolamo
pointed
out
the
desk
in
the
refectory
from
which
one
of
the
brothers
read
while
the
rest
were
eating
she
took
him
to
task
oh
but
i
can
t
think
that
s
at
all
good
for
the
digestion
you
know
using
the
brain
that
way
whilst
you
re
at
table
i
really
hope
you
don
t
listen
too
attentively
it
would
be
better
for
you
in
the
long
run
even
in
a
religious
point
of
view
but
now
byron
you
show
me
his
cell
the
monk
deprecated
the
of
such
a
cell
and
glanced
in
perplexity
at
ferris
who
came
to
his
relief
you
couldn
t
have
seen
his
cell
if
he
d
had
one
vervain
they
don
t
admit
ladies
to
the
what
nonsense
answered
vervain
apparently
regarding
this
as
another
of
ferris
s
pleasantries
but
padre
girolamo
silently
confirmed
his
statement
and
she
briskly
assailed
the
rule
as
a
disrespect
to
the
sex
which
reflected
even
upon
the
virgin
the
object
as
he
was
forced
to
allow
of
their
high
veneration
he
smiled
patiently
and
confessed
that
vervain
had
all
the
reasons
on
her
side
at
the
polyglot
where
she
handsomely
bought
every
kind
of
armenian
book
and
pamphlet
and
thus
repaid
in
the
only
way
possible
the
trouble
their
visit
had
given
he
did
not
offer
to
take
leave
of
them
but
after
speaking
with
ferris
of
whom
he
seemed
an
old
friend
he
led
them
through
the
garden
environing
the
convent
to
a
little
pavilion
perched
on
the
wall
that
defends
the
island
from
the
tides
of
the
lagoon
a
presently
followed
them
bearing
a
tray
with
coffee
toasted
rusk
and
a
jar
of
that
conserve
of
which
is
the
convent
s
delicate
hospitality
to
favored
guests
vervain
cried
out
over
the
poetic
confection
when
padre
girolamo
told
her
what
it
was
and
her
daughter
suffered
herself
to
express
a
guarded
pleasure
the
amiable
matron
brushed
the
crumbs
of
the
from
her
lap
when
the
lunch
was
ended
and
fitting
on
her
glasses
leaned
forward
for
a
better
look
at
the
monk
s
face
i
m
perfectly
delighted
she
said
you
must
be
very
happy
here
i
suppose
you
yes
answered
the
monk
rapturously
so
happy
that
i
should
be
content
never
to
leave
san
lazzaro
i
came
here
when
i
was
very
young
and
the
greater
part
of
my
life
has
been
passed
on
this
little
island
it
is
my
home
my
do
you
never
go
away
oh
yes
sometimes
to
constantinople
sometimes
to
london
and
and
you
ve
never
been
to
america
yet
well
now
i
ll
tell
you
you
ought
to
go
you
would
like
it
i
know
and
our
people
would
give
you
a
very
cordial
reception
the
monk
appealed
once
more
to
ferris
with
a
look
ferris
broke
into
a
laugh
i
don
t
believe
padre
girolamo
would
come
in
quality
of
distinguished
foreigner
vervain
and
i
don
t
think
he
d
know
what
to
do
with
one
of
our
cordial
well
he
ought
to
go
to
america
any
way
he
can
t
really
know
anything
about
us
till
he
s
been
there
just
think
how
ignorant
the
english
are
of
our
country
you
come
won
t
you
i
should
be
delighted
to
welcome
you
at
my
house
in
providence
rhode
island
is
a
small
state
but
there
s
a
great
deal
of
wealth
there
and
very
good
society
in
providence
it
s
quite
you
know
said
vervain
expressively
she
rose
as
she
spoke
and
led
the
way
back
to
the
gondola
she
told
padre
girolamo
that
they
were
to
be
some
weeks
in
venice
and
made
him
promise
to
breakfast
with
them
at
their
hotel
she
smiled
and
nodded
to
him
after
the
boat
had
pushed
off
and
kept
him
bowing
on
the
what
a
lovely
place
and
what
a
perfectly
heavenly
morning
you
given
us
ferris
i
we
never
can
thank
you
enough
for
it
and
now
do
you
know
what
i
m
thinking
of
perhaps
you
can
help
me
it
was
byron
s
studying
there
put
me
in
mind
of
it
how
soon
do
the
mosquitoes
come
about
the
end
of
june
responded
ferris
mechanically
staring
with
helpless
mystification
at
vervain
very
well
then
there
s
no
reason
why
we
shouldn
t
stay
in
venice
till
that
time
we
are
both
very
fond
of
the
place
and
we
d
quite
concluded
this
morning
to
stop
here
till
the
mosquitoes
came
you
know
ferris
my
daughter
had
to
leave
school
much
earlier
than
she
ought
for
my
health
has
obliged
me
to
travel
a
great
deal
since
i
lost
my
husband
and
i
must
have
her
with
me
for
we
re
all
that
there
is
of
us
we
haven
t
a
chick
or
a
child
that
s
related
to
us
anywhere
but
wherever
we
stop
even
for
a
few
weeks
i
contrive
to
get
her
some
kind
of
instruction
i
feel
the
need
of
it
so
much
in
my
own
case
for
to
tell
you
the
truth
ferris
i
married
too
young
i
suppose
i
should
do
the
same
thing
over
again
if
it
was
to
be
done
over
but
don
t
you
see
my
mind
wasn
t
properly
formed
and
then
following
my
husband
about
from
pillar
to
post
and
my
first
baby
born
when
i
was
nineteen
well
it
wasn
t
education
at
any
rate
whatever
else
it
was
and
i
ve
determined
that
florida
though
we
are
such
a
pair
of
wanderers
shall
not
have
my
regrets
i
got
teachers
for
her
in
england
the
english
are
not
anything
like
so
disagreeable
at
home
as
they
are
in
traveling
and
we
stayed
there
two
years
and
i
did
in
france
and
i
did
in
germany
and
now
italian
here
we
are
in
italy
and
i
think
we
ought
to
improve
the
time
florida
knows
a
good
deal
of
italian
already
for
her
music
teacher
in
france
was
an
italian
and
he
taught
her
the
language
as
well
as
music
what
she
wants
now
i
should
say
is
to
perfect
her
accent
and
get
facility
i
think
she
ought
to
have
some
one
come
every
day
and
read
and
converse
an
hour
or
two
with
vervain
leaned
back
in
her
seat
and
looked
at
ferris
who
said
feeling
that
the
matter
was
referred
to
him
i
think
without
presuming
to
say
what
miss
vervain
s
need
of
instruction
is
that
your
idea
is
a
very
good
he
mused
in
silence
his
wonder
that
so
much
addlepatedness
as
was
at
once
observable
in
vervain
should
exist
along
with
so
much
it
s
certainly
very
good
in
the
abstract
he
added
with
a
glance
at
the
daughter
as
if
the
sense
must
be
hers
she
did
not
meet
his
glance
at
once
but
with
an
impatient
recognition
of
the
heat
that
was
now
great
for
the
warmth
with
which
she
was
dressed
she
pushed
her
sleeve
from
her
wrist
showing
its
delicious
whiteness
and
letting
her
fingers
trail
through
the
cool
water
she
dried
them
on
her
handkerchief
and
then
bent
her
eyes
full
upon
him
as
if
challenging
him
to
think
this
no
clearly
the
sense
does
not
come
from
her
said
ferris
to
himself
it
is
impossible
to
think
well
of
the
mind
of
a
girl
who
treats
one
with
tacit
contempt
yes
resumed
vervain
it
s
certainly
very
good
in
the
abstract
but
oh
dear
me
you
ve
no
idea
of
the
difficulties
in
the
way
i
may
speak
frankly
with
you
ferris
for
you
are
here
as
the
representative
of
the
country
and
you
naturally
sympathize
with
the
difficulties
of
americans
abroad
the
teachers
will
fall
in
love
with
their
mother
began
miss
vervain
and
then
she
checked
herself
ferris
gave
a
vengeful
laugh
really
vervain
though
i
sympathize
with
you
in
my
official
capacity
i
must
own
that
as
a
man
and
a
brother
i
can
t
help
feeling
a
little
sorry
for
those
poor
fellows
to
be
sure
they
are
to
be
pitied
of
course
and
feel
for
them
i
did
when
i
was
a
girl
for
the
same
thing
used
to
happen
then
i
don
t
know
why
florida
should
be
subjected
to
such
embarrassments
too
it
does
seem
sometimes
as
if
it
were
something
in
the
blood
they
all
get
the
idea
that
you
have
money
you
then
i
should
say
that
it
might
be
something
in
the
pocket
suggested
ferris
with
a
look
at
miss
vervain
in
whose
silent
suffering
as
he
imagined
it
he
found
a
malicious
consolation
for
her
scorn
well
whatever
it
is
replied
vervain
it
s
too
vexatious
of
course
going
to
new
places
that
way
as
we
re
always
doing
and
only
going
to
stay
for
a
limited
time
perhaps
you
can
t
pick
and
choose
and
even
when
you
get
an
elderly
teacher
they
re
as
bad
as
any
it
really
is
too
trying
now
when
i
was
talking
with
that
nice
monk
of
yours
at
the
convent
there
i
couldn
t
help
thinking
how
perfectly
delightful
it
would
be
if
florida
could
have
for
a
teacher
why
couldn
t
she
he
told
me
that
he
would
come
to
take
breakfast
or
lunch
with
us
but
not
dinner
for
he
always
had
to
be
at
the
convent
before
nightfall
well
he
might
come
to
give
the
lessons
sometime
in
the
middle
of
the
you
couldn
t
manage
it
vervain
i
know
you
couldn
t
answered
ferris
earnestly
i
m
sure
the
armenians
never
do
anything
of
the
kind
they
re
all
very
busy
men
engaged
in
ecclesiastical
or
literary
work
and
they
couldn
t
give
the
why
not
there
was
but
byron
went
to
them
and
he
studied
armenian
not
italian
with
them
padre
girolamo
speaks
perfect
italian
for
all
that
i
can
see
but
i
doubt
if
he
d
undertake
to
impart
the
native
accent
which
is
what
you
want
in
fact
the
scheme
is
altogether
well
said
vervain
i
m
exceedingly
sorry
i
had
quite
set
my
heart
on
it
i
never
took
such
a
fancy
to
any
one
in
such
a
short
time
it
seemed
to
be
a
case
of
love
at
first
sight
on
both
sides
said
ferris
padre
girolamo
doesn
t
shower
those
syruped
indiscriminately
upon
thanks
returned
vervain
it
s
very
good
of
you
to
say
so
ferris
and
it
s
very
gratifying
all
round
but
don
t
you
see
it
doesn
t
serve
the
present
purpose
what
teachers
do
you
know
of
she
had
been
by
marriage
so
long
in
the
service
of
the
united
states
that
she
still
regarded
its
agents
as
part
of
her
own
domestic
economy
consuls
she
everywhere
employed
as
functionaries
specially
appointed
to
look
after
the
interests
of
american
ladies
traveling
without
protection
in
the
week
which
had
passed
since
her
arrival
in
venice
there
had
been
no
day
on
which
she
did
not
appeal
to
ferris
for
help
or
sympathy
or
advice
she
took
amiable
possession
of
him
at
once
and
she
had
established
an
amusing
sort
of
intimacy
with
him
to
which
the
haughty
trepidations
of
her
daughter
set
certain
bounds
but
in
which
the
demand
that
he
should
find
her
a
suitable
italian
teacher
seemed
trivially
matter
of
course
yes
i
know
several
teachers
he
said
after
thinking
awhile
but
they
re
all
open
to
the
objection
of
being
human
and
besides
they
all
do
things
in
a
set
kind
of
way
and
i
m
afraid
they
wouldn
t
enter
into
the
spirit
of
any
scheme
of
instruction
that
departed
very
widely
from
he
paused
and
vervain
gave
a
sketch
of
the
different
professional
masters
whom
she
had
employed
in
the
various
countries
of
her
sojourn
and
a
disquisition
upon
their
several
lives
and
characters
fortifying
her
statements
by
reference
of
doubtful
points
to
her
daughter
this
occupied
some
time
and
ferris
listened
to
it
all
with
an
abstracted
air
at
last
he
said
with
a
smile
there
was
an
italian
priest
came
to
see
me
this
morning
who
astonished
me
by
knowing
english
with
a
brogue
that
he
d
learned
from
an
english
priest
straight
from
dublin
perhaps
might
do
vervain
he
s
professionally
pledged
you
know
not
to
give
the
kind
of
annoyance
you
ve
suffered
from
in
teachers
he
would
do
as
well
as
padre
girolamo
i
do
you
really
are
you
in
earnest
well
no
i
believe
i
m
not
i
haven
t
the
least
idea
he
would
do
he
belongs
to
the
church
militant
he
came
to
me
with
the
model
of
a
cannon
he
s
invented
and
he
wanted
a
passport
to
go
to
america
so
that
he
might
offer
his
cannon
to
our
how
curious
said
vervain
and
her
daughter
looked
frankly
into
ferris
s
face
but
i
know
it
s
one
of
your
you
overpraise
me
vervain
if
i
could
make
such
jokes
as
that
priest
was
i
should
set
up
for
a
humorist
at
once
he
had
the
touch
of
pathos
that
they
say
all
true
pieces
of
humor
ought
to
have
he
went
on
instinctively
addressing
himself
to
miss
vervain
who
did
not
repulse
him
he
made
me
melancholy
and
his
face
haunts
me
i
should
like
to
paint
him
priests
are
generally
such
a
snuffy
common
lot
and
i
dare
say
he
concluded
he
s
sufficiently
commonplace
too
though
he
didn
t
look
it
spare
your
romance
miss
the
young
lady
blushed
resentfully
i
see
as
little
romance
as
joke
in
it
she
said
it
was
a
cannon
returned
ferris
without
taking
any
notice
of
her
and
with
a
sort
of
absent
laugh
that
would
make
it
very
lively
for
the
southerners
if
they
had
it
poor
fellow
i
suppose
he
came
with
high
hopes
of
me
and
expected
me
to
receive
his
invention
with
eloquent
praises
i
ve
no
doubt
he
figured
himself
furnished
not
only
with
a
passport
but
with
a
letter
from
me
to
president
lincoln
and
foresaw
his
own
triumphal
entry
into
washington
and
his
honorable
interviews
with
the
admiring
generals
of
the
union
forces
to
whom
he
should
display
his
wonderful
cannon
too
bad
isn
t
it
and
why
didn
t
you
give
him
the
passport
and
the
letter
asked
vervain
oh
that
s
a
state
secret
returned
ferris
and
you
think
he
won
t
do
for
our
purpose
i
don
t
well
i
m
not
so
sure
of
it
tell
me
something
more
about
i
don
t
know
anything
more
about
him
besides
there
isn
t
the
gondola
had
already
entered
the
canal
and
was
swiftly
approaching
the
hotel
oh
yes
there
is
pleaded
vervain
laying
her
hand
on
his
arm
i
want
you
to
come
in
and
dine
with
us
we
dine
thank
you
i
can
t
affairs
of
the
nation
you
know
rebel
privateer
on
the
canal
of
the
really
vervain
leaned
towards
ferris
for
sharper
scrutiny
of
his
face
her
glasses
sprang
from
her
nose
and
precipitated
themselves
into
his
bosom
allow
me
he
said
with
burlesque
politeness
withdrawing
them
from
the
recesses
of
his
waistcoat
and
gravely
presenting
them
miss
vervain
burst
into
a
helpless
laugh
then
she
turned
toward
her
mother
with
a
kind
of
indignant
tenderness
and
gently
arranged
her
shawl
so
that
it
should
not
drop
off
when
she
rose
to
leave
the
gondola
she
did
not
look
again
at
ferris
who
resisted
vervain
s
entreaties
to
remain
and
took
leave
as
soon
as
the
gondola
landed
the
ladies
went
to
their
room
where
florida
lifted
from
the
table
a
vase
of
hyacinths
and
stepping
out
upon
the
balcony
flung
the
flowers
into
the
canal
as
she
put
down
the
empty
vase
the
lingering
perfume
of
the
banished
flowers
haunted
the
air
of
the
room
why
florida
said
her
mother
those
were
the
flowers
that
ferris
gave
you
did
you
fancy
they
had
begun
to
decay
the
smell
of
hyacinths
when
they
re
a
little
old
is
dreadful
but
i
can
t
imagine
a
gentleman
s
giving
you
flowers
that
were
at
all
oh
mother
don
t
speak
to
me
cried
miss
vervain
passionately
clasping
her
hands
to
her
face
now
i
see
that
i
ve
been
saying
something
to
vex
you
my
darling
and
seating
herself
beside
the
young
girl
on
the
sofa
she
fondly
took
down
her
hands
do
tell
me
what
it
was
was
it
about
your
teachers
falling
in
love
with
you
you
know
they
did
florida
pestachiavi
and
schulze
both
and
that
horrid
old
did
you
think
i
liked
any
better
on
that
account
to
have
you
talk
it
over
with
a
stranger
asked
florida
still
angrily
that
s
true
my
dear
said
vervain
penitently
but
if
it
worried
you
why
didn
t
you
do
something
to
stop
me
give
me
a
hint
or
just
a
little
knock
somewhere
no
mother
i
d
rather
not
then
you
d
have
come
out
with
the
whole
thing
to
prove
that
you
were
right
it
s
better
to
let
it
go
said
florida
with
a
fierce
laugh
half
sob
but
it
s
strange
that
you
can
t
remember
how
such
things
torment
i
suppose
it
s
my
weak
health
dear
answered
the
mother
i
didn
t
use
to
be
so
but
now
i
don
t
really
seem
to
have
the
strength
to
be
sensible
i
know
it
s
silly
as
well
as
you
the
talk
just
seems
to
keep
going
on
of
itself
slipping
out
slipping
out
but
you
needn
t
mind
ferris
won
t
think
you
could
ever
have
done
anything
out
of
the
way
i
m
sure
you
don
t
act
with
as
if
you
d
ever
encouraged
anybody
i
think
you
re
too
haughty
with
him
florida
and
now
his
he
s
detestable
he
s
conceited
and
presuming
beyond
all
endurance
i
don
t
care
what
he
thinks
of
me
but
it
s
his
manner
towards
you
that
i
can
t
i
suppose
it
s
rather
free
said
vervain
but
then
you
know
my
dear
i
shall
be
soon
getting
to
be
an
old
lady
and
besides
i
always
feel
as
if
consuls
were
a
kind
of
one
of
the
family
he
s
been
very
obliging
since
we
came
i
don
t
know
what
we
should
have
done
without
him
and
i
don
t
object
to
a
little
ease
of
manner
in
the
gentlemen
i
never
he
makes
fun
of
you
cried
florida
and
there
at
the
convent
she
said
bursting
into
angry
tears
he
kept
exchanging
glances
with
that
monk
as
if
he
he
s
insulting
and
i
hate
him
do
you
mean
that
he
thought
your
mother
ridiculous
florida
asked
vervain
gravely
you
must
have
misunderstood
his
looks
indeed
you
must
i
can
t
imagine
why
he
should
i
remember
that
i
talked
particularly
well
during
our
whole
visit
my
mind
was
active
for
i
felt
unusually
strong
and
i
was
interested
in
everything
it
s
nothing
but
a
fancy
of
yours
or
your
prejudice
florida
but
it
s
odd
now
i
ve
sat
down
for
a
moment
how
worn
out
i
feel
and
vervain
fitted
on
her
glasses
but
even
then
felt
uncertainly
about
for
the
empty
vase
on
the
table
before
her
it
isn
t
a
goblet
mother
said
florida
i
ll
get
you
some
do
and
then
throw
a
shawl
over
me
i
m
sleepy
and
a
nap
before
dinner
will
do
me
good
i
don
t
see
why
i
m
so
drowsy
of
late
i
suppose
it
s
getting
into
the
sea
air
here
at
venice
though
it
s
mountain
air
that
makes
you
drowsy
but
you
re
quite
mistaken
about
ferris
he
isn
t
capable
of
anything
really
rude
besides
there
wouldn
t
have
been
any
sense
in
the
young
girl
brought
the
water
and
then
knelt
beside
the
sofa
on
which
she
arranged
the
pillows
under
her
mother
and
covered
her
with
soft
wraps
she
laid
her
cheek
against
the
thinner
face
don
t
mind
anything
i
ve
said
mother
let
s
talk
of
something
the
mother
drew
some
loose
threads
of
the
daughter
s
hair
through
her
slender
fingers
but
said
little
more
and
presently
fell
into
a
deep
slumber
florida
gently
lifted
her
head
away
and
remained
kneeling
before
the
sofa
looking
into
the
sleeping
face
with
an
expression
of
strenuous
compassionate
devotion
mixed
with
a
vague
alarm
and
and
a
certain
wondering
anxiety
iii
don
ippolito
had
slept
upon
his
interview
with
ferris
and
now
sat
in
his
laboratory
amidst
the
many
witnesses
of
his
inventive
industry
with
the
model
of
the
cannon
on
the
workbench
before
him
he
had
neatly
mounted
it
on
wheels
that
its
completeness
might
do
him
the
greater
credit
with
the
consul
when
he
should
show
it
him
but
the
carriage
had
been
broken
in
his
pocket
on
the
way
home
by
an
unlucky
thrust
from
the
burden
of
a
porter
and
the
poor
toy
lay
there
disabled
as
if
to
dramatize
that
premature
explosion
in
the
secret
chamber
his
heart
was
in
these
inventions
of
his
which
had
as
yet
so
grudgingly
repaid
his
affection
for
their
sake
he
had
stinted
himself
of
many
needful
things
the
meagre
stipend
which
he
received
from
the
patrimony
of
his
church
eked
out
with
the
money
paid
him
for
baptisms
funerals
and
marriages
and
for
masses
by
people
who
had
friends
to
be
prayed
out
of
purgatory
would
at
best
have
barely
sufficed
to
support
him
but
he
denied
himself
everything
save
the
necessary
decorums
of
dress
and
lodging
he
fasted
like
a
saint
and
slept
hard
as
a
hermit
that
he
might
spend
upon
these
ungrateful
creatures
of
his
brain
they
were
the
work
of
his
own
hands
and
so
he
saved
the
expense
of
their
construction
but
there
were
many
little
outlays
for
materials
and
for
tools
which
he
could
not
avoid
and
with
him
a
little
was
all
they
not
only
famished
him
they
isolated
him
his
superiors
in
the
church
and
his
brother
priests
looked
with
doubt
or
ridicule
upon
the
labors
for
which
he
shunned
their
company
while
he
gave
up
the
other
social
joys
few
and
small
which
a
priest
might
know
in
the
venice
of
that
day
when
all
generous
spirits
regarded
him
with
suspicion
for
his
cloth
s
sake
and
church
and
state
were
alert
to
detect
disaffection
or
indifference
in
him
but
bearing
these
things
willingly
and
living
as
frugally
as
he
might
he
had
still
not
enough
and
he
had
been
fain
to
assume
the
instruction
of
a
young
girl
of
old
and
noble
family
in
certain
branches
of
polite
learning
which
a
young
lady
of
that
sort
might
fitly
know
the
family
was
not
so
rich
as
it
was
old
and
noble
and
don
ippolito
was
paid
from
its
purse
rather
than
its
pride
but
the
slender
salary
was
a
help
these
patricians
were
very
good
to
him
many
a
time
he
dined
with
them
and
so
spared
the
cost
of
his
own
pottage
at
home
they
always
gave
him
coffee
when
he
came
and
that
was
a
saving
at
the
proper
seasons
little
presents
from
them
were
not
wanting
in
a
word
his
condition
was
not
privation
he
did
his
duty
as
a
teacher
faithfully
and
the
only
trouble
with
it
was
that
the
young
girl
was
growing
into
a
young
woman
and
that
he
could
not
go
on
teaching
her
forever
in
an
evil
hour
as
it
seemed
to
don
ippolito
that
made
the
years
she
had
been
his
pupil
shrivel
to
a
mere
pinch
of
time
there
came
from
a
young
count
of
the
friuli
visiting
venice
an
offer
of
marriage
and
don
ippolito
lost
his
place
it
was
hard
but
he
bade
himself
have
patience
and
he
composed
an
ode
for
the
nuptials
of
his
late
pupil
which
together
with
a
brief
sketch
of
her
ancestral
history
he
had
elegantly
printed
according
to
the
italian
usage
and
distributed
among
the
family
friends
he
also
made
a
sonnet
to
the
bridegroom
and
these
literary
tributes
were
handsomely
acknowledged
he
managed
a
whole
year
upon
the
proceeds
and
kept
a
cheerful
spirit
till
the
last
soldo
was
spent
inventing
one
thing
after
another
and
giving
much
time
and
money
to
a
new
principle
of
steam
propulsion
which
as
applied
without
steam
to
a
small
boat
on
the
canal
before
his
door
failed
to
work
though
it
had
no
logical
excuse
for
its
delinquency
he
tried
to
get
other
pupils
but
he
got
none
and
he
began
to
dream
of
going
to
america
he
pinned
his
faith
in
all
sorts
of
magnificent
possibilities
to
the
names
of
franklin
fulton
and
morse
he
was
so
ignorant
of
our
politics
and
geography
as
to
suppose
us
at
war
with
the
south
american
spaniards
but
he
knew
that
english
was
the
language
of
the
north
and
he
applied
himself
to
the
study
of
it
heaven
only
knows
what
kind
of
inventor
s
utopia
our
poor
country
appeared
to
him
in
these
dreams
of
his
and
i
can
but
dimly
figure
it
to
myself
but
he
might
very
naturally
desire
to
come
to
a
land
where
the
spirit
of
invention
is
recognized
and
fostered
and
where
he
could
hope
to
find
that
comfort
of
incentive
and
companionship
which
our
artists
find
in
italy
the
idea
of
the
cannon
had
occurred
to
him
suddenly
one
day
in
one
of
his
reveries
and
he
had
made
haste
to
realize
it
carefully
studying
the
form
and
general
effect
of
the
austrian
cannon
under
the
gallery
of
the
ducal
palace
to
the
high
embarrassment
of
the
croat
sentry
who
paced
up
and
down
there
and
who
did
not
feel
free
to
order
off
a
priest
as
he
would
a
civilian
don
ippolito
s
model
was
of
admirable
finish
he
even
painted
the
carriage
yellow
and
black
because
that
of
the
original
was
so
and
colored
the
piece
to
look
like
brass
and
he
lost
a
day
while
the
paint
was
drying
after
he
was
otherwise
ready
to
show
it
to
the
consul
he
had
parted
from
ferris
with
some
gleams
of
comfort
caught
chiefly
from
his
kindly
manner
but
they
had
died
away
before
nightfall
and
this
morning
he
could
not
rekindle
them
he
had
had
his
coffee
served
to
him
on
the
bench
as
his
frequent
custom
was
but
it
stood
untasted
in
the
little
copper
pot
beside
the
dismounted
cannon
though
it
was
now
ten
o
clock
and
it
was
full
time
he
had
breakfasted
for
he
had
risen
early
to
perform
the
matin
service
for
three
peasant
women
two
beggars
a
cat
and
a
paralytic
nobleman
in
the
ancient
and
beautiful
church
to
which
he
was
attached
he
had
tried
to
go
about
his
wonted
occupations
but
he
was
still
sitting
idle
before
his
bench
while
his
servant
gossiped
from
her
balcony
to
the
mistress
of
the
next
house
across
a
calle
so
deep
and
narrow
that
it
opened
like
a
mountain
chasm
beneath
them
it
were
well
if
the
master
read
his
breviary
a
little
more
instead
of
always
maddening
himself
with
those
blessed
inventions
that
eat
more
soldi
than
a
christian
and
never
come
to
anything
there
he
sits
before
his
table
as
if
he
were
nailed
to
his
chair
and
lets
his
coffee
cool
and
god
knows
i
was
ready
to
drink
it
warm
two
hours
ago
and
never
looks
at
me
if
i
open
the
door
twenty
times
to
see
whether
he
has
finished
holy
patience
you
have
not
even
the
advantage
of
fasting
to
the
glory
of
god
in
this
house
though
you
keep
lent
the
year
round
it
s
the
devil
s
lent
say
eh
diana
there
goes
the
bell
who
now
adieu
lusetta
to
meet
again
dear
farewell
she
ran
to
another
window
and
admitted
the
visitor
it
was
ferris
and
she
went
to
announce
him
to
her
master
by
the
title
he
had
given
while
he
amused
his
leisure
in
the
darkness
below
by
falling
over
a
with
a
loud
clattering
of
his
cane
on
the
copper
lid
after
which
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
priest
begging
him
to
remain
at
his
convenience
a
moment
till
he
could
descend
and
show
him
the
way
upstairs
his
eyes
were
not
yet
used
to
the
obscurity
of
the
narrow
entry
in
which
he
stood
when
he
felt
a
cold
hand
laid
on
his
and
passively
yielded
himself
to
its
guidance
he
tried
to
excuse
himself
for
intruding
upon
don
ippolito
so
soon
but
the
priest
in
far
suppler
italian
overwhelmed
him
with
lamentations
that
he
should
be
so
unworthy
the
honor
done
him
and
ushered
his
guest
into
his
apartment
he
plainly
took
it
for
granted
that
ferris
had
come
to
see
his
inventions
in
compliance
with
the
invitation
he
had
given
him
the
day
before
and
he
made
no
affectation
of
delay
though
after
the
excitement
of
the
greetings
was
past
it
was
with
a
quiet
dejection
that
he
rose
and
offered
to
lead
his
visitor
to
his
laboratory
the
whole
place
was
an
outgrowth
of
himself
it
was
his
history
as
well
as
his
character
it
recorded
his
quaint
and
childish
tastes
his
restless
endeavors
his
partial
and
halting
successes
the
in
which
he
had
paused
with
ferris
was
painted
to
look
like
a
where
the
vines
sprang
from
the
floor
and
flourishing
up
the
trellised
walls
with
many
a
wanton
tendril
and
flaunting
leaf
displayed
their
lavish
clusters
of
white
and
purple
all
over
the
ceiling
it
touched
ferris
when
don
ippolito
confessed
that
this
decoration
had
been
the
distraction
of
his
own
vacant
moments
to
find
that
it
was
like
certain
he
had
seen
in
remote
corners
of
venice
before
the
doors
of
degenerate
palaces
or
forming
the
entrances
of
restaurants
and
did
not
seem
at
all
to
have
been
studied
from
in
the
country
he
perceived
the
archaic
striving
for
exact
truth
and
he
successfully
praised
the
mechanical
skill
and
love
of
reality
with
which
it
was
done
but
he
was
silenced
by
a
collection
of
paintings
in
don
ippolito
s
parlor
where
he
had
been
made
to
sit
down
a
moment
hard
they
were
in
line
fixed
in
expression
and
opaque
in
color
these
copies
of
famous
masterpieces
saints
of
either
sex
ascensions
assumptions
martyrdoms
and
what
not
and
they
were
not
quite
comprehensible
till
don
ippolito
explained
that
he
had
made
them
from
such
prints
of
the
subjects
as
he
could
get
and
had
colored
them
after
his
own
fancy
all
this
in
a
city
whose
art
had
been
the
glory
of
the
world
for
nigh
half
a
thousand
years
struck
ferris
as
yet
more
comically
pathetic
than
the
frescoed
he
stared
about
him
for
some
sort
of
escape
from
the
pictures
and
his
eye
fell
upon
a
piano
and
a
melodeon
placed
end
to
end
in
a
right
angle
don
ippolito
seeing
his
look
of
inquiry
sat
down
and
briefly
played
the
same
air
with
a
hand
upon
each
instrument
ferris
smiled
don
ippolito
you
are
another
da
vinci
a
universal
bagatelles
bagatelles
said
the
priest
pensively
but
he
rose
with
greater
spirit
than
he
had
yet
shown
and
preceded
the
consul
into
the
little
room
that
served
him
for
a
smithy
it
seemed
from
some
peculiarities
of
shape
to
have
once
been
an
oratory
but
it
was
now
begrimed
with
smoke
and
dust
from
the
forge
which
don
ippolito
had
set
up
in
it
the
embers
of
a
recent
fire
the
bellows
the
pincers
the
hammers
and
the
other
implements
of
the
trade
gave
it
a
sinister
effect
as
if
the
place
of
prayer
had
been
invaded
by
mocking
imps
or
as
if
some
hapless
mortal
in
contract
with
the
evil
powers
were
here
searching
by
the
help
of
the
adversary
for
the
forbidden
secrets
of
the
metals
and
of
fire
in
those
days
ferris
was
an
uncompromising
enemy
of
the
theatricalization
of
italy
or
indeed
of
anything
but
the
fancy
of
the
young
priest
at
work
in
this
place
appealed
to
him
all
the
more
potently
because
of
the
sort
of
tragic
innocence
which
seemed
to
characterize
don
ippolito
s
expression
he
longed
intensely
to
sketch
the
picture
then
and
there
but
he
had
strength
to
rebuke
the
fancy
as
something
that
could
not
make
itself
intelligible
without
the
help
of
such
accessories
as
he
despised
and
he
victoriously
followed
the
priest
into
his
larger
workshop
where
his
inventions
complete
and
incomplete
were
stored
and
where
he
had
been
seated
when
his
visitor
arrived
the
high
windows
and
the
frescoed
ceiling
were
festooned
with
dusty
cobwebs
litter
of
shavings
and
whittlings
strewed
the
floor
mechanical
implements
and
contrivances
were
everywhere
and
don
ippolito
s
listlessness
seemed
to
return
upon
him
again
at
the
sight
of
the
familiar
disorder
conspicuous
among
other
objects
lay
the
illogically
unsuccessful
model
of
the
new
principle
of
steam
propulsion
untouched
since
the
day
when
he
had
lifted
it
out
of
the
canal
and
carried
it
indoors
through
the
ranks
of
grinning
spectators
from
a
shelf
above
it
he
took
down
models
of
a
and
a
perpetual
motion
fantastic
researches
in
the
impossible
i
never
expected
results
from
these
experiments
with
which
i
nevertheless
once
pleased
myself
he
said
and
turned
impatiently
to
various
pieces
of
portable
furniture
chairs
tables
bedsteads
which
by
folding
up
their
legs
and
tops
condensed
themselves
into
flat
boxes
developing
handles
at
the
side
for
convenience
in
carrying
they
were
painted
and
varnished
and
were
in
all
respects
complete
they
had
indeed
won
favorable
mention
at
an
exposition
of
the
provincial
society
of
arts
and
industries
and
ferris
could
applaud
their
ingenuity
sincerely
though
he
had
his
tacit
doubts
of
their
usefulness
he
fell
silent
again
when
don
ippolito
called
his
notice
to
a
photographic
camera
so
contrived
with
straps
and
springs
that
you
could
snatch
by
its
help
whatever
joy
there
might
be
in
taking
your
own
photograph
and
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
of
a
submarine
boat
a
a
movable
bridge
or
the
very
many
other
principles
and
ideas
to
which
don
ippolito
s
cunning
hand
had
given
shape
more
or
less
imperfect
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
all
however
perfect
or
imperfect
had
some
fatal
defect
they
were
aspirations
toward
the
impossible
or
realizations
of
the
trivial
and
superfluous
yet
for
all
this
they
strongly
appealed
to
the
painter
as
the
stunted
fruit
of
a
talent
denied
opportunity
instruction
and
sympathy
as
he
looked
from
them
at
last
to
the
questioning
face
of
the
priest
and
considered
out
of
what
disheartened
and
solitary
patience
they
must
have
come
in
this
city
dead
hundreds
of
years
to
all
such
endeavor
he
could
not
utter
some
glib
phrases
of
compliment
that
he
had
on
his
tongue
if
don
ippolito
had
been
taken
young
he
might
perhaps
have
amounted
to
something
though
this
was
questionable
but
at
thirty
as
he
looked
now
with
his
undisciplined
purposes
and
his
head
full
of
vagaries
of
which
these
things
were
the
tangible
witness
ferris
let
his
eyes
drop
again
they
fell
upon
the
ruin
of
the
cannon
and
he
said
don
ippolito
it
s
very
good
of
you
to
take
the
trouble
of
showing
me
these
matters
and
i
hope
you
ll
pardon
the
ungrateful
return
if
i
can
not
offer
any
definite
opinion
of
them
now
they
are
rather
out
of
my
way
i
confess
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
i
could
order
an
experimental
copy
of
your
cannon
here
for
trial
by
my
government
but
i
can
t
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
it
was
not
altogether
the
wish
to
see
these
inventions
of
yours
that
brought
me
here
oh
said
don
ippolito
with
a
mortified
air
i
am
afraid
that
i
have
wearied
the
signor
not
at
all
not
at
all
ferris
made
haste
to
answer
with
a
frown
at
his
own
awkwardness
but
your
speaking
english
yesterday
perhaps
what
i
was
thinking
of
is
quite
foreign
to
your
tastes
and
he
hesitated
with
a
look
of
perplexity
while
don
ippolito
stood
before
him
in
an
attitude
of
expectation
pressing
the
points
of
his
fingers
together
and
looking
curiously
into
his
face
the
case
is
this
resumed
ferris
desperately
there
are
two
american
ladies
friends
of
mine
sojourning
in
venice
who
expect
to
be
here
till
midsummer
they
are
mother
and
daughter
and
the
young
lady
wants
to
read
and
speak
italian
with
somebody
a
few
hours
each
day
the
question
is
whether
it
is
quite
out
of
your
way
or
not
to
give
her
lessons
of
this
kind
i
ask
it
quite
at
a
venture
i
suppose
no
harm
is
done
at
any
rate
and
he
looked
at
don
ippolito
with
apologetic
perturbation
no
said
the
priest
there
is
no
harm
on
the
contrary
i
am
at
this
moment
in
a
position
to
consider
it
a
great
favor
that
you
do
me
in
offering
me
this
employment
i
accept
it
with
the
greatest
pleasure
oh
he
cried
breaking
by
a
sudden
impulse
from
the
composure
with
which
he
had
begun
to
speak
you
don
t
know
what
you
do
for
me
you
lift
me
out
of
despair
before
you
came
i
had
reached
one
of
those
passes
that
seem
the
last
bound
of
endeavor
but
you
give
me
new
life
now
i
can
go
on
with
my
experiment
i
can
attest
my
gratitude
by
possessing
your
native
country
of
the
weapon
i
had
designed
for
it
i
am
sure
of
the
principle
some
slight
improvement
perhaps
the
use
of
some
different
explosive
would
get
over
that
difficulty
you
suggested
he
said
eagerly
yes
something
can
be
done
god
bless
you
my
dear
little
son
i
mean
perdoni
my
dear
wait
not
so
fast
said
ferris
with
a
laugh
yet
a
little
annoyed
that
a
question
so
purely
tentative
as
his
should
have
met
at
once
such
a
definite
response
are
you
quite
sure
you
can
do
what
they
want
he
unfolded
to
him
as
fully
as
he
understood
it
vervain
s
scheme
don
ippolito
entered
into
it
with
perfect
intelligence
he
said
that
he
had
already
had
charge
of
the
education
of
a
young
girl
of
noble
family
and
he
could
therefore
the
more
confidently
hope
to
be
useful
to
this
american
lady
a
light
of
joyful
hope
shone
in
his
dreamy
eyes
the
whole
man
changed
he
assumed
the
hospitable
and
caressing
host
he
conducted
ferris
back
to
his
parlor
and
making
him
sit
upon
the
hard
sofa
that
was
his
hard
bed
by
night
he
summoned
his
servant
and
bade
her
serve
them
coffee
she
closed
her
lips
firmly
and
waved
her
finger
before
her
face
to
signify
that
there
was
no
more
coffee
then
he
bade
her
fetch
it
from
the
caffè
and
he
listened
with
a
sort
of
rapt
inattention
while
ferris
again
returned
to
the
subject
and
explained
that
he
had
approached
him
without
first
informing
the
ladies
and
that
he
must
regard
nothing
as
final
it
was
at
this
point
that
don
ippolito
who
had
understood
so
clearly
what
vervain
wanted
appeared
a
little
slow
to
understand
and
ferris
had
a
doubt
whether
it
was
from
subtlety
or
from
simplicity
that
the
priest
seemed
not
to
comprehend
the
impulse
on
which
he
had
acted
he
finished
his
coffee
in
this
perplexity
and
when
he
rose
to
go
don
ippolito
followed
him
down
to
the
and
preserved
him
from
a
second
encounter
with
the
but
don
ippolito
remember
i
make
no
engagement
for
the
ladies
whom
you
must
see
before
anything
is
settled
said
ferris
surely
surely
answered
the
priest
and
he
remained
smiling
at
the
door
till
the
american
turned
the
next
corner
then
he
went
back
to
his
and
took
up
the
broken
model
from
the
bench
but
he
could
not
work
at
it
now
he
could
not
work
at
anything
he
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
floor
could
he
really
have
been
so
stupid
because
his
mind
was
on
his
ridiculous
cannon
wondered
ferris
as
he
sauntered
frowning
away
and
he
tried
to
prepare
his
own
mind
for
his
meeting
with
the
vervains
to
whom
he
must
now
go
at
once
he
felt
abused
and
victimized
yet
it
was
an
amusing
experience
and
he
found
himself
able
to
interest
both
of
the
ladies
in
it
the
younger
had
received
him
as
coldly
as
the
forms
of
greeting
would
allow
but
as
he
talked
she
drew
nearer
him
with
a
reluctant
haughtiness
which
he
noted
he
turned
the
more
conspicuously
towards
vervain
well
to
make
a
long
story
short
he
said
i
couldn
t
discourage
don
ippolito
he
refused
to
be
dismayed
as
i
should
have
been
at
the
notion
of
teaching
miss
vervain
i
didn
t
arrange
with
him
not
to
fall
in
love
with
her
as
his
secular
predecessors
have
done
it
seemed
superfluous
but
you
can
mention
it
to
him
if
you
like
in
fact
said
ferris
suddenly
addressing
the
daughter
you
might
make
the
stipulation
yourself
miss
she
looked
at
him
a
moment
with
a
sort
of
defenseless
pain
that
made
him
ashamed
and
then
walked
away
from
him
towards
the
window
with
a
frank
resentment
that
made
him
smile
as
he
continued
but
i
suppose
you
would
like
to
have
some
explanation
of
my
motive
in
precipitating
don
ippolito
upon
you
in
this
way
when
i
told
you
only
yesterday
that
he
wouldn
t
do
at
all
in
fact
i
think
myself
that
i
ve
behaved
rather
for
a
representative
of
the
country
but
i
ll
tell
you
and
you
won
t
be
surprised
to
learn
that
i
acted
from
mixed
motives
i
m
not
at
all
sure
that
he
ll
do
i
ve
had
awful
misgivings
about
it
since
i
left
him
and
i
m
glad
of
the
chance
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
when
i
came
to
think
the
matter
over
last
night
the
fact
that
he
had
taught
himself
english
with
the
help
of
an
irishman
for
the
pronunciation
seemed
to
promise
that
he
d
have
the
right
sort
of
sympathy
with
your
scheme
and
it
showed
that
he
must
have
something
practical
about
him
too
and
here
s
where
the
selfish
admixture
comes
in
i
didn
t
have
your
interests
solely
in
mind
when
i
went
to
see
don
ippolito
i
hadn
t
been
able
to
get
rid
of
him
he
stuck
in
my
thought
i
fancied
he
might
be
glad
of
the
pay
of
a
teacher
and
i
had
half
a
notion
to
ask
him
to
let
me
paint
him
it
was
an
even
chance
whether
i
should
try
to
secure
him
for
miss
vervain
or
for
art
as
they
call
it
miss
vervain
won
because
she
could
pay
him
and
i
didn
t
see
how
art
could
i
can
bring
him
round
any
time
and
that
s
the
whole
inconsequent
business
my
consolation
is
that
i
ve
left
you
perfectly
free
there
s
nothing
thanks
said
vervain
then
it
s
all
settled
you
can
bring
him
as
soon
as
you
like
to
our
new
place
we
ve
taken
that
apartment
we
looked
at
the
other
day
and
we
re
going
into
it
this
afternoon
here
s
the
landlord
s
letter
she
added
drawing
a
paper
out
of
her
pocket
if
he
s
cheated
us
i
suppose
you
can
see
justice
done
i
didn
t
want
to
trouble
you
you
re
a
woman
of
business
vervain
said
ferris
the
man
s
a
perfect
jew
or
a
perfect
christian
one
ought
to
say
in
venice
we
true
believers
do
gouge
so
much
more
infamously
here
and
you
let
him
get
you
in
black
and
white
before
you
come
to
me
well
he
continued
as
he
glanced
at
the
paper
you
ve
done
it
he
makes
you
pay
one
half
too
much
however
it
s
cheap
enough
twice
as
cheap
as
your
but
i
don
t
care
for
cheapness
i
hate
to
be
imposed
upon
what
s
to
be
done
about
it
nothing
if
he
has
your
letter
as
you
have
his
it
s
a
bargain
and
you
must
stand
to
a
bargain
oh
nonsense
now
ferris
this
is
merely
a
note
of
mutual
yes
that
s
one
way
of
looking
at
it
the
civil
tribunal
would
call
it
a
binding
agreement
of
the
closest
tenure
if
you
want
to
go
to
law
about
i
go
to
law
about
oh
no
you
won
t
unless
you
mean
to
spend
your
remaining
days
and
all
your
substance
in
venice
come
you
haven
t
done
so
badly
vervain
i
don
t
call
four
rooms
completely
furnished
for
housekeeping
with
that
lovely
garden
at
all
dear
at
eleven
francs
a
day
besides
the
landlord
is
a
man
of
excellent
feeling
sympathetic
and
obliging
and
a
perfect
gentleman
though
he
is
such
an
outrageous
scoundrel
he
ll
cheat
you
of
course
in
whatever
he
can
you
must
look
out
for
that
but
he
ll
do
you
any
sort
of
little
neighborly
kindness
said
ferris
getting
to
the
door
before
vervain
could
intercept
him
i
ll
come
to
your
new
place
this
evening
to
see
how
you
are
florida
said
vervain
this
is
i
wouldn
t
mind
it
mother
we
pay
very
little
after
yes
but
we
pay
too
much
that
s
what
i
can
t
bear
and
as
you
said
yesterday
i
don
t
think
ferris
s
manners
are
quite
respectful
to
he
only
told
you
the
truth
i
think
he
advised
you
for
the
best
the
matter
couldn
t
be
helped
but
i
call
it
a
want
of
feeling
to
speak
the
truth
so
we
won
t
have
to
complain
of
that
in
our
landlord
it
seems
said
florida
perhaps
not
in
our
priest
either
she
added
yes
that
kind
of
ferris
said
vervain
it
was
thoroughly
thoughtful
and
considerate
what
i
call
an
instance
of
true
delicacy
i
m
really
quite
curious
to
see
him
don
ippolito
how
very
odd
to
call
a
priest
i
should
have
said
padre
don
always
makes
you
think
of
a
spanish
cavalier
don
rodrigo
something
like
they
went
on
to
talk
desultorily
of
don
ippolito
and
what
he
might
be
like
in
speaking
of
him
the
day
before
ferris
had
hinted
at
some
mysterious
sadness
in
him
and
to
hint
of
sadness
in
a
man
always
interests
women
in
him
whether
they
are
old
or
young
the
old
have
suffered
the
young
forebode
suffering
their
interest
in
don
ippolito
had
not
been
diminished
by
what
ferris
had
told
them
of
his
visit
to
the
priest
s
house
and
of
the
things
he
had
seen
there
for
there
had
always
been
the
same
strain
of
pity
in
his
laughing
account
and
he
had
imparted
none
of
his
doubts
to
them
they
did
not
talk
as
if
it
were
strange
that
ferris
should
do
what
he
had
yesterday
said
he
would
not
do
perhaps
as
women
they
could
not
find
such
a
thing
strange
but
it
vexed
him
more
and
more
as
he
went
about
all
afternoon
thinking
of
his
inconsistency
and
wondering
whether
he
had
not
acted
rashly
iv
the
palace
in
which
vervain
had
taken
an
apartment
fronted
on
a
broad
campo
and
hung
its
empty
marble
balconies
from
gothic
windows
above
a
silence
scarcely
to
be
matched
elsewhere
in
venice
the
local
pharmacy
the
caffè
the
grocery
the
fruiterer
s
the
other
shops
with
which
every
venetian
campo
is
furnished
had
each
a
certain
life
about
it
but
it
was
a
silent
life
and
at
midday
a
woman
clacking
across
the
flags
in
her
shoes
made
echoes
whose
garrulity
was
interrupted
by
no
other
sound
in
the
early
morning
when
the
lid
of
the
public
cistern
in
the
centre
of
the
campo
was
unlocked
there
was
a
clamor
of
voices
and
a
clangor
of
copper
vessels
as
the
housewives
of
the
neighborhood
and
the
local
force
of
frinlan
drew
their
day
s
supply
of
water
and
on
that
sort
of
special
parochial
holiday
called
a
the
campo
hummed
and
clattered
and
shrieked
with
a
multitude
celebrating
the
day
around
the
stands
where
pumpkin
seeds
and
roast
pumpkin
and
were
sold
and
before
the
movable
kitchen
where
cakes
were
fried
in
caldrons
of
oil
and
uproariously
offered
to
the
crowd
by
the
cook
who
did
not
suffer
himself
to
be
embarrassed
by
the
rival
drama
of
adjoining
but
continued
to
bellow
forth
his
bargains
all
day
long
and
far
into
the
night
when
the
flames
under
his
kettles
painted
his
visage
a
fine
crimson
the
sagra
once
over
however
the
campo
relapsed
into
its
habitual
silence
and
no
one
looking
at
the
front
of
the
palace
would
have
thought
of
it
as
a
place
for
foreign
sojourners
but
it
was
not
on
this
side
that
the
landlord
tempted
his
tenants
his
principal
notice
of
lodgings
to
let
was
affixed
to
the
of
the
palace
which
opened
on
a
smaller
channel
so
near
the
grand
canal
that
no
wandering
eye
could
fail
to
see
it
the
portal
was
a
tall
arch
of
venetian
gothic
tipped
with
a
carven
flame
steps
of
white
istrian
stone
descended
to
the
level
of
the
lowest
ebb
irregularly
embossed
with
barnacles
and
dabbling
long
fringes
of
soft
green
in
the
rising
and
falling
tide
swarms
of
and
beetles
played
over
the
edges
of
the
steps
and
crabs
scuttled
into
deeper
water
at
the
approach
of
a
gondola
a
length
of
brick
wall
to
which
patches
of
stucco
still
clung
stretched
from
the
gate
on
either
hand
under
cover
of
an
ivy
that
flung
its
mesh
of
shining
green
from
within
where
there
lurked
a
lovely
garden
stately
spacious
for
venice
and
full
of
a
delicious
surprise
for
whoso
opened
upon
it
in
the
midst
it
had
a
broken
fountain
with
a
marble
naiad
standing
on
a
shell
and
looking
saucier
than
the
sculptor
meant
from
having
lost
the
point
of
her
nose
nymphs
and
fauns
and
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
her
kinsfolk
coquetted
in
and
out
among
the
greenery
in
flirtation
not
to
be
embarrassed
by
the
fracture
of
an
arm
or
the
casting
of
a
leg
or
so
one
lady
had
no
head
but
she
was
the
boldest
of
all
in
this
garden
there
were
some
mulberry
and
pomegranate
trees
several
of
which
hung
about
the
fountain
with
seats
in
their
shade
and
for
the
rest
there
seemed
to
be
mostly
roses
and
oleanders
with
other
shrubs
of
a
kind
that
made
the
greatest
show
of
blossom
and
cost
the
least
for
tendance
a
wide
terrace
stretched
across
the
rear
of
the
palace
dropping
to
the
garden
path
by
a
flight
of
balustraded
steps
and
upon
this
terrace
opened
the
long
windows
of
vervain
s
parlor
and
her
landlord
owned
only
the
first
story
and
the
basement
of
the
palace
in
some
corner
of
which
he
cowered
with
his
servants
his
taste
for
pictures
and
and
his
little
branch
of
inquiry
into
venetian
history
whatever
it
was
ready
to
let
himself
or
anything
he
had
for
hire
at
a
moment
s
notice
but
very
pleasant
gentle
and
unobtrusive
a
cheat
and
a
liar
but
of
a
kind
heart
and
sympathetic
manners
under
his
protection
vervain
set
up
her
impermanent
household
gods
the
apartment
was
taken
only
from
week
to
week
and
as
she
freely
explained
to
the
hovering
about
with
offers
of
service
she
knew
herself
too
well
ever
to
unpack
anything
that
would
not
spoil
by
remaining
packed
she
made
her
trunks
yield
all
the
appliances
necessary
for
an
invalid
s
comfort
and
then
left
them
in
a
state
to
be
strapped
and
transported
to
the
station
within
half
a
day
after
the
desire
of
change
or
the
exigencies
of
her
feeble
health
caused
her
going
everything
for
housekeeping
was
furnished
with
the
rooms
there
was
a
gondolier
and
a
sort
of
in
the
employ
of
the
landlord
of
whom
vervain
hired
them
and
she
caressingly
dismissed
the
padrone
at
an
early
moment
after
her
arrival
with
the
charge
to
find
a
maid
for
herself
and
daughter
as
if
she
had
been
waiting
at
the
next
door
this
maid
appeared
promptly
and
being
venetian
and
in
domestic
service
her
name
was
of
course
nina
vervain
now
said
to
florida
that
everything
was
perfect
and
contentedly
began
her
life
in
venice
by
telling
ferris
when
he
came
in
the
evening
that
he
could
bring
don
ippolito
the
day
after
the
morrow
if
he
liked
she
and
florida
sat
on
the
terrace
waiting
for
them
on
the
morning
named
when
ferris
with
the
priest
in
his
clerical
best
came
up
the
garden
path
in
the
sunny
light
don
ippolito
s
best
was
a
little
he
had
faltered
a
while
before
leaving
home
over
the
sad
choice
between
a
shabby
cylinder
hat
of
obsolete
fashion
and
his
priestly
beaver
and
had
at
last
put
on
the
latter
with
a
sigh
he
had
made
his
servant
polish
the
buckles
of
his
shoes
and
instead
of
a
band
of
linen
round
his
throat
he
wore
a
strip
of
cloth
covered
with
small
white
beads
edged
above
and
below
with
a
single
row
of
pale
blue
ones
as
he
mounted
the
steps
with
ferris
vervain
came
forward
a
little
to
meet
them
while
florida
rose
and
stood
beside
her
chair
in
a
sort
of
proud
suspense
and
timidity
the
elder
lady
was
in
that
black
from
which
she
had
so
seldom
been
able
to
escape
but
the
daughter
wore
a
dress
of
delicate
green
in
which
she
seemed
a
part
of
the
young
season
that
everywhere
clothed
itself
in
the
same
tint
the
sunlight
fell
upon
her
blonde
hair
melting
into
its
light
gold
her
level
brows
frowned
somewhat
with
the
glance
of
scrutiny
which
she
gave
the
dark
young
priest
who
was
making
his
stately
bow
to
her
mother
and
trying
to
answer
her
english
greetings
in
the
same
tongue
my
daughter
said
vervain
and
don
ippolito
made
another
low
bow
and
then
looked
at
the
girl
with
a
sort
of
frank
and
melancholy
wonder
as
she
turned
and
exchanged
a
few
words
with
ferris
who
was
assailing
her
seriousness
and
hauteur
with
unabashed
levity
of
compliment
a
quick
light
flashed
and
fled
in
her
cheek
as
she
talked
and
the
fringes
of
her
serious
asking
eyes
swept
slowly
up
and
down
as
she
bent
them
upon
him
a
moment
before
she
broke
abruptly
not
coquettishly
away
from
him
and
moved
towards
her
mother
while
ferris
walked
off
to
the
other
end
of
the
terrace
with
a
laugh
vervain
and
the
priest
were
trying
each
other
in
french
and
not
making
great
advance
he
explained
to
florida
in
italian
and
she
answered
him
hesitatingly
whereupon
he
praised
her
italian
in
set
phrase
thank
you
said
the
girl
sincerely
i
have
tried
to
learn
i
hope
she
added
as
before
you
can
make
me
see
how
little
i
the
deprecating
wave
of
the
hand
with
which
don
ippolito
appealed
to
her
from
herself
seemed
arrested
midway
by
his
perception
of
some
novel
quality
in
her
he
said
gravely
that
he
should
try
to
be
of
use
and
then
the
two
stood
silent
come
ferris
called
out
vervain
breakfast
is
ready
and
i
want
you
to
take
me
too
much
honor
said
the
painter
coming
forward
and
offering
his
arm
and
vervain
led
the
way
indoors
i
suppose
i
ought
to
have
taken
don
ippolito
s
arm
she
confided
in
but
the
fact
is
our
french
is
so
unlike
that
we
don
t
understand
each
other
very
oh
returned
ferris
i
ve
known
italians
and
americans
whom
frenchmen
themselves
couldn
t
you
see
it
s
an
american
breakfast
said
vervain
with
a
critical
glance
at
the
table
before
she
sat
down
all
but
hot
bread
you
have
and
don
ippolito
was
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
confronted
by
a
breakfast
of
hot
eggs
and
toast
fried
potatoes
and
coffee
with
milk
with
a
choice
of
tea
he
subdued
all
signs
of
the
wonder
he
must
have
felt
and
beyond
cutting
his
meat
into
little
bits
before
eating
it
did
nothing
to
betray
his
strangeness
to
the
feast
the
breakfast
had
passed
off
very
pleasantly
with
occasional
lapses
we
break
down
under
the
burden
of
so
many
languages
said
ferris
it
is
an
de
let
us
fix
upon
a
common
maccheronic
may
i
trouble
you
for
a
poco
piú
di
sugar
dans
mon

vervain
what
do
you
think
of
the
bellazza
de
ce
weather
magnifique
don
ippolito
how
ridiculous
said
vervain
in
a
tone
of
fond
admiration
aside
to
don
ippolito
who
smiled
but
shrank
from
contributing
to
the
new
tongue
very
well
then
said
the
painter
i
shall
stick
to
my
native
bergamask
for
the
future
and
don
ippolito
may
translate
for
the
foreign
he
ended
by
speaking
english
with
everybody
don
ippolito
eked
out
his
speeches
to
vervain
in
that
tongue
with
a
little
french
florida
conscious
of
ferris
s
ironical
observance
used
an
embarrassed
but
defiant
italian
with
the
priest
i
m
so
pleased
said
vervain
rising
when
ferris
said
that
he
must
go
and
florida
shook
hands
with
both
guests
thank
you
vervain
i
could
have
gone
before
if
i
d
thought
you
would
have
liked
it
answered
the
painter
oh
nonsense
now
returned
the
lady
you
know
what
i
mean
i
m
perfectly
delighted
with
him
she
continued
getting
ferris
to
one
side
and
i
he
must
have
a
good
accent
so
very
kind
of
you
will
you
arrange
with
him
about
the
pay
such
a
thanks
then
i
needn
t
say
anything
to
him
about
that
i
m
so
glad
i
had
him
to
breakfast
the
first
day
though
florida
thought
not
of
course
one
needn
t
keep
it
up
but
seriously
it
isn
t
an
ordinary
case
you
ferris
laughed
at
her
with
a
sort
of
affectionate
disrespect
and
said
don
ippolito
lingered
for
a
while
to
talk
over
the
proposed
lessons
and
then
went
after
more
elaborate
adieux
vervain
remained
thoughtful
a
moment
before
she
said
that
was
rather
droll
what
mother
his
cutting
his
meat
into
small
bites
before
he
began
to
eat
but
perhaps
it
s
the
venetian
custom
at
any
rate
my
dear
he
s
a
gentleman
in
virtue
of
his
profession
and
i
couldn
t
do
less
than
ask
him
to
breakfast
he
has
beautiful
manners
and
if
he
must
take
snuff
i
suppose
it
s
neater
to
carry
two
handkerchiefs
though
it
does
look
odd
i
wish
he
wouldn
t
take
i
don
t
see
why
we
need
care
mother
at
any
rate
we
can
not
help
that
s
true
my
dear
and
his
nails
now
when
they
re
spread
out
on
a
book
you
know
to
keep
it
open
won
t
it
be
unpleasant
they
seem
to
have
just
such
fingernails
all
over
europe
except
in
oh
yes
i
know
it
i
dare
say
we
shouldn
t
care
for
it
in
him
if
he
didn
t
seem
so
very
nice
otherwise
how
handsome
he
is
it
was
understood
that
don
ippolito
should
come
every
morning
at
ten
o
clock
and
read
and
talk
with
miss
vervain
for
an
hour
or
two
but
vervain
s
hospitality
was
too
aggressive
for
the
letter
of
the
agreement
she
oftener
had
him
to
breakfast
at
nine
for
as
she
explained
to
ferris
she
could
not
endure
to
have
him
feel
that
it
was
a
mere
mercenary
transaction
and
there
was
no
limit
fixed
for
the
lessons
on
these
days
when
she
could
she
had
ferris
come
too
and
she
missed
him
when
he
did
not
come
i
like
that
bluntness
of
his
she
professed
to
her
daughter
and
i
don
t
mind
his
making
light
of
me
you
are
so
apt
to
be
heavy
if
you
re
not
made
light
of
occasionally
i
certainly
shouldn
t
want
a
to
be
so
respectful
and
obedient
as
you
are
my
the
painter
honestly
returned
her
fondness
and
with
not
much
greater
reason
he
saw
that
she
took
pleasure
in
his
talk
and
enjoyed
it
even
when
she
did
not
understand
it
and
this
is
a
kind
of
flattery
not
easy
to
resist
besides
there
was
very
little
ladies
society
in
venice
in
those
times
and
ferris
after
trying
the
little
he
could
get
at
had
gladly
denied
himself
its
pleasures
and
consorted
with
the
young
men
he
met
at
the
caffè
s
or
in
the
piazza
but
when
the
vervains
came
they
recalled
to
him
the
younger
days
in
which
he
had
delighted
in
the
companionship
of
women
after
so
long
disuse
it
was
charming
to
be
with
a
beautiful
girl
who
neither
regarded
him
with
distrust
nor
expected
him
to
ask
her
in
marriage
because
he
sat
alone
with
her
rode
out
with
her
in
a
gondola
walked
with
her
read
with
her
all
young
men
like
a
house
in
which
no
ado
is
made
about
their
coming
and
going
and
vervain
perfectly
understood
the
art
of
letting
him
make
himself
at
home
he
perceived
with
amusement
that
this
amiable
lady
who
never
did
an
ungraceful
thing
nor
wittingly
said
an
ungracious
one
was
very
much
of
a
bohemian
at
heart
the
gentlest
and
most
blameless
of
the
tribe
but
still
lawless
whether
from
her
campaigning
married
life
or
the
rovings
of
her
widowhood
or
by
natural
disposition
and
that
miss
vervain
was
inclined
to
be
conventionally
strict
but
with
her
irregular
training
was
at
a
loss
for
rules
by
which
to
check
her
mother
s
little
waywardnesses
her
anxious
perplexity
at
times
together
with
her
heroic
obedience
and
unswerving
loyalty
to
her
mother
had
something
pathetic
as
well
as
amusing
in
it
he
saw
her
tried
almost
to
tears
by
her
mother
s
helpless
frankness
for
vervain
was
apparently
one
of
those
ladies
whom
the
intolerable
surprise
of
having
anything
come
into
their
heads
causes
instantly
to
say
or
do
it
and
he
observed
that
she
never
tried
to
pass
off
her
endurance
with
any
feminine
arts
but
seemed
to
defy
him
to
think
what
he
would
of
it
perhaps
she
was
not
able
to
do
otherwise
he
thought
of
her
at
times
as
a
person
wholly
abandoned
to
the
truth
her
pride
was
on
the
alert
against
him
she
may
have
imagined
that
he
was
covertly
smiling
at
her
and
she
no
doubt
tasted
the
ironical
flavor
of
much
of
his
talk
and
behavior
for
in
those
days
he
liked
to
qualify
his
devotion
to
the
vervains
with
a
certain
nonchalant
slight
which
while
the
mother
openly
enjoyed
it
filled
the
daughter
with
anger
and
apprehension
quite
at
random
she
visited
points
of
his
informal
manner
with
unmeasured
reprisal
others
for
which
he
might
have
blamed
himself
she
passed
over
with
strange
caprice
sometimes
this
attitude
of
hers
provoked
him
and
sometimes
it
disarmed
him
but
whether
they
were
at
feud
or
keeping
an
armed
truce
or
as
now
and
then
happened
were
in
an
which
he
found
very
charming
the
thing
that
he
always
contrived
to
treat
with
silent
respect
and
forbearance
in
miss
vervain
was
that
sort
of
aggressive
tenderness
with
which
she
hastened
to
shield
the
foibles
of
her
mother
that
was
something
very
good
in
her
pride
he
finally
decided
at
the
same
time
he
did
not
pretend
to
understand
the
curious
filial
which
it
involved
another
thing
in
her
that
puzzled
him
was
her
devoutness
vervain
could
with
difficulty
be
got
to
church
but
her
daughter
missed
no
service
of
the
english
ritual
in
the
old
palace
where
the
british
and
american
tourists
assembled
once
a
week
with
their
in
one
pocket
and
their
in
the
other
and
buried
the
tomahawk
under
the
altar
ferris
was
often
sent
with
her
and
then
his
thoughts
which
were
a
young
man
s
wandered
from
the
service
to
the
beautiful
girl
at
his
side
the
golden
head
that
punctiliously
bowed
itself
at
the
proper
places
in
the
liturgy
the
full
lips
that
murmured
the
responses
the
silken
lashes
that
swept
her
pale
cheeks
as
she
perused
the
morning
lesson
he
knew
that
the
vervains
were
not
episcopalians
when
at
home
for
vervain
had
told
him
so
and
that
florida
went
to
the
english
service
because
there
was
no
other
he
conjectured
that
perhaps
her
touch
of
ritualism
came
from
mere
love
of
any
form
she
could
make
sure
of
the
servants
in
vervain
s
lightly
ordered
household
with
the
sympathetic
quickness
of
the
italians
learned
to
use
him
as
the
next
friend
of
the
family
and
though
they
may
have
had
their
decorous
surprise
at
his
untrammeled
footing
they
probably
excused
the
whole
relation
as
a
phase
of
that
foreign
eccentricity
to
which
their
nation
is
so
amiable
if
they
were
not
able
to
cast
the
same
mantle
of
charity
over
don
ippolito
s
allegiance
and
doubtless
they
had
their
reserves
concerning
such
frankly
familiar
treatment
of
so
dubious
a
character
as
priest
still
as
a
priest
they
stood
somewhat
in
awe
of
him
they
had
the
spontaneous
loyalty
of
their
race
to
the
people
they
served
and
they
never
intimated
by
a
look
that
they
found
it
strange
when
don
ippolito
freely
came
and
went
vervain
had
quite
adopted
him
into
her
family
while
her
daughter
seemed
more
at
ease
with
him
than
with
ferris
and
treated
him
with
a
grave
politeness
which
had
something
also
of
compassion
and
of
reverence
in
it
ferris
observed
that
she
was
always
particularly
careful
of
his
supposable
sensibilities
as
a
roman
catholic
and
that
the
priest
was
oddly
indifferent
to
this
deference
as
if
it
would
have
mattered
very
little
to
him
whether
his
church
was
spared
or
not
he
had
a
way
of
lightly
avoiding
ferris
fancied
not
only
religious
points
on
which
they
could
disagree
but
all
phases
of
religion
as
matters
of
indifference
at
such
times
miss
vervain
relaxed
her
reverential
attitude
and
used
him
with
something
like
rebuke
as
if
it
did
not
please
her
to
have
the
representative
of
even
an
alien
religion
slight
his
office
as
if
her
respect
were
for
his
priesthood
and
her
compassion
for
him
personally
that
was
rather
hard
for
don
ippolito
ferris
thought
and
waited
to
see
him
snubbed
outright
some
day
when
he
should
behave
without
sufficient
gravity
the
blossoms
came
and
went
upon
the
pomegranate
and
almond
trees
in
the
garden
and
some
of
the
earliest
roses
were
in
their
prime
everywhere
was
so
full
leaf
that
the
wantonest
of
the
strutting
nymphs
was
forced
into
a
sort
of
decent
seclusion
but
the
careless
naiad
of
the
fountain
burnt
in
sunlight
that
subtly
increased
its
fervors
day
by
day
and
it
was
no
longer
beginning
to
be
warm
it
was
warm
when
one
morning
ferris
and
miss
vervain
sat
on
the
steps
of
the
terrace
waiting
for
don
ippolito
to
join
them
at
breakfast
by
this
time
the
painter
was
well
on
with
the
picture
of
don
ippolito
which
the
first
sight
of
the
priest
had
given
him
a
longing
to
paint
and
he
had
been
just
now
talking
of
it
with
miss
vervain
but
why
do
you
paint
him
simply
as
a
priest
she
asked
i
should
think
you
would
want
to
make
him
the
centre
of
some
famous
or
romantic
scene
she
added
gravely
looking
into
his
eyes
as
he
sat
with
his
head
thrown
back
against
the
balustrade
no
i
doubt
if
you
answered
ferris
or
you
d
see
that
a
venetian
priest
doesn
t
need
any
tawdry
accessories
what
do
you
want
somebody
administering
the
extreme
unction
to
a
victim
of
the
council
of
ten
a
priest
stepping
into
a
confessional
at
the
frari
tomb
of
canova
in
the
distance
perspective
of
one
of
the
naves
and
so
forth
with
his
eye
on
a
pretty
devotee
coming
up
to
unburden
her
conscience
i
ve
no
patience
with
the
follies
people
think
and
say
about
venice
florida
stared
in
haughty
question
at
the
painter
you
re
no
worse
than
the
rest
he
continued
with
indifference
to
her
anger
at
his
bluntness
you
all
think
that
there
can
be
no
picture
of
venice
without
a
gondola
or
a
bridge
of
sighs
in
it
have
you
ever
read
the
merchant
of
venice
or
othello
there
isn
t
a
boat
nor
a
bridge
nor
a
canal
mentioned
in
either
of
them
and
yet
they
breathe
and
pulsate
with
the
very
life
of
venice
i
m
going
to
try
to
paint
a
venetian
priest
so
that
you
ll
know
him
without
a
bit
of
conventional
venice
near
it
was
shakespeare
who
wrote
those
plays
said
florida
ferris
bowed
in
mock
suffering
from
her
sarcasm
you
d
better
have
some
sort
of
symbol
in
your
picture
of
a
venetian
priest
or
people
will
wonder
why
you
came
so
far
to
paint
father
o
i
don
t
say
i
shall
succeed
ferris
answered
in
fact
i
ve
made
one
failure
already
and
i
m
pretty
well
on
with
a
second
but
the
principle
is
right
all
the
same
i
don
t
expect
everybody
to
see
the
difference
between
don
ippolito
and
father
o
brien
at
any
rate
what
i
m
going
to
paint
is
the
lingering
pagan
in
the
man
the
renunciation
first
of
the
inherited
nature
and
then
of
a
personality
that
would
have
enjoyed
the
world
i
want
to
show
that
baffled
aspiration
apathetic
despair
and
rebellious
longing
which
you
caten
in
his
face
when
he
s
off
his
guard
and
that
suppressed
look
which
is
the
characteristic
expression
of
all
austrian
venice
then
said
ferris
laughing
i
must
work
in
that
small
suspicion
of
jesuit
which
there
is
in
every
priest
but
it
s
quite
possible
i
may
make
a
father
o
brien
of
you
won
t
make
a
don
ippolito
of
him
said
florida
after
serious
consideration
of
his
face
to
see
whether
he
was
quite
in
earnest
if
you
put
all
that
into
him
he
has
the
simplest
and
openest
look
in
the
world
she
added
warmly
and
there
s
neither
pagan
nor
martyr
nor
rebel
in
ferris
laughed
again
excuse
me
i
don
t
think
you
know
i
can
convince
florida
rose
and
looking
down
the
garden
path
said
he
s
coming
and
as
don
ippolito
drew
near
his
face
lighting
up
with
a
joyous
and
innocent
smile
she
continued
absently
he
s
got
on
new
stockings
and
a
different
coat
and
the
stockings
were
indeed
new
and
the
hat
was
not
the
accustomed
but
a
new
silk
cylinder
with
a
very
worldly
curling
brim
don
ippolito
s
coat
also
was
of
a
more
mundane
cut
than
the
talare
he
wore
a
waistcoat
and
meeting
the
stockings
at
the
knee
with
a
sprightly
buckle
his
person
showed
no
traces
of
the
snuff
with
which
it
used
to
be
so
plentifully
dusted
in
fact
he
no
longer
took
snuff
in
the
presence
of
the
ladies
the
first
week
he
had
noted
an
inexplicable
uneasiness
in
them
when
he
drew
forth
that
blue
cotton
handkerchief
after
the
solace
of
a
pinch
shortly
afterwards
being
alone
with
florida
he
saw
her
give
a
nervous
start
at
its
appearance
he
blushed
violently
and
put
it
back
into
the
pocket
from
which
he
had
half
drawn
it
and
whence
it
never
emerged
again
in
her
presence
the
contessina
his
former
pupil
had
not
shown
any
aversion
to
don
ippolito
s
snuff
or
his
blue
handkerchief
but
then
the
contessina
had
never
rebuked
his
by
the
tints
of
rose
and
ivory
with
which
miss
vervain
s
hands
bewildered
him
it
was
a
little
droll
how
anxiously
he
studied
the
ways
of
these
americans
and
conformed
to
them
as
far
as
he
knew
his
english
grew
rapidly
in
their
society
and
it
happened
sometimes
that
the
only
italian
in
the
day
s
lesson
was
what
he
read
with
florida
for
she
always
yielded
to
her
mother
s
wish
to
talk
and
vervain
preferred
the
ease
of
her
native
tongue
he
was
americanizing
in
that
good
lady
s
hands
as
fast
as
she
could
transform
him
and
he
listened
to
her
with
trustful
reverence
as
to
a
woman
of
striking
though
eccentric
mind
yet
he
seemed
finally
to
refer
every
point
to
florida
as
if
with
an
intuition
of
steadier
and
stronger
character
in
her
and
now
as
he
ascended
the
terrace
steps
in
his
modified
costume
he
looked
intently
at
her
she
swept
him
from
head
to
foot
with
a
glance
and
then
gravely
welcomed
him
with
unchanged
countenance
at
the
same
moment
vervain
came
out
through
one
of
the
long
windows
and
adjusting
her
glasses
said
with
a
start
why
my
dear
don
ippolito
i
shouldn
t
have
known
you
indeed
madama
asked
the
priest
with
a
painful
smile
is
it
so
great
a
change
we
can
wear
this
dress
as
well
as
the
other
if
we
why
of
course
it
s
very
becoming
and
all
that
but
it
does
look
so
out
of
character
vervain
said
leading
the
way
to
the
it
s
like
seeing
a
military
man
in
a
civil
it
must
be
a
great
relief
to
lay
aside
the
uniform
now
and
then
mother
said
florida
as
they
sat
down
i
can
remember
that
papa
used
to
be
glad
to
get
out
of
perfectly
wild
assented
vervain
but
he
never
seemed
the
same
person
soldiers
and
clergymen
are
so
much
more
stylish
in
their
own
dress
not
stylish
exactly
but
taking
don
t
you
know
there
don
ippolito
interposed
ferris
you
had
better
put
on
your
talare
and
your
nicchio
again
your
dress
isn
t
acceptable
you
the
painter
spoke
in
italian
but
don
ippolito
answered
with
certain
blunders
which
it
would
be
tedious
to
reproduce
in
his
patient
conscientious
english
half
sadly
half
playfully
and
glancing
at
florida
before
he
turned
to
vervain
you
are
as
rigid
as
the
rest
of
the
world
madama
i
thought
you
would
like
this
dress
but
it
seems
that
you
think
it
a
masquerade
as
madamigella
says
it
is
a
relief
to
lay
aside
the
uniform
now
and
then
for
us
who
fight
the
spiritual
enemies
as
well
as
for
the
other
soldiers
there
was
one
time
when
i
was
younger
and
in
the
subdiaconate
orders
that
i
put
off
the
priest
s
dress
altogether
and
wore
citizen
s
clothes
not
an
abbate
s
suit
like
this
we
were
in
padua
another
young
priest
and
i
my
nearest
and
only
friend
and
for
a
whole
night
we
walked
about
the
streets
in
that
dress
meeting
the
students
as
they
strolled
singing
through
the
moonlight
we
went
to
the
theatre
and
to
the
caffè
we
smoked
cigars
all
the
time
laughing
and
trembling
to
think
of
the
tonsure
under
our
hats
but
in
the
morning
we
had
to
put
on
the
stockings
and
the
talare
and
the
nicchio
don
ippolito
gave
a
melancholy
laugh
he
had
thrust
the
corner
of
his
napkin
into
his
collar
seeing
that
ferris
had
not
his
so
he
twitched
it
out
and
made
a
feint
of
its
having
been
all
the
time
in
his
lap
every
one
was
silent
as
if
something
shocking
had
been
said
florida
looked
with
grave
rebuke
at
don
ippolito
whose
story
affected
ferris
like
that
of
some
girl
s
adventure
in
men
s
clothes
he
was
in
terror
lest
vervain
should
be
going
to
say
it
was
like
that
she
was
going
to
say
something
he
made
haste
to
forestall
her
and
turn
the
talk
on
other
things
the
next
day
the
priest
came
in
his
usual
dress
and
he
did
not
again
try
to
escape
from
it
vi
one
afternoon
as
don
ippolito
was
posing
to
ferris
for
his
picture
of
a
venetian
priest
the
painter
asked
to
make
talk
have
you
hit
upon
that
new
explosive
yet
which
is
to
utilize
your
cannon
or
are
you
engaged
upon
something
altogether
new
no
answered
the
other
uneasily
i
have
not
touched
the
cannon
since
that
day
you
saw
it
at
my
house
and
as
for
other
things
i
have
not
been
able
to
put
my
mind
to
them
i
have
made
a
few
trifles
which
i
have
ventured
to
offer
the
ferris
had
noticed
the
ingenious
which
don
ippolito
had
presented
to
florida
and
the
footstool
contrived
with
springs
and
hinges
so
that
it
would
fold
up
into
the
compass
of
an
ordinary
portfolio
which
vervain
carried
about
with
her
an
odd
look
which
the
painter
caught
at
and
missed
came
into
the
priest
s
face
as
he
resumed
i
suppose
it
is
the
distraction
of
my
new
occupation
and
of
the
new
acquaintances
so
very
strange
to
me
in
every
way
that
i
have
made
in
your
amiable
which
hinders
me
from
going
about
anything
in
earnest
now
that
their
munificence
has
enabled
me
to
pursue
my
aims
with
greater
advantages
than
ever
before
but
this
idle
mood
will
pass
and
in
the
mean
time
i
am
very
happy
they
are
real
angels
and
madama
is
a
true
mrs
vervain
is
rather
peculiar
said
the
painter
retiring
a
few
paces
from
his
picture
and
quizzing
it
through
his
eyes
she
is
a
woman
who
has
had
affliction
enough
to
turn
a
stronger
head
than
hers
could
ever
have
been
he
added
kindly
but
she
has
the
best
heart
in
the
world
in
fact
he
burst
forth
she
is
the
most
extraordinary
combination
of
perfect
fool
and
perfect
lady
i
ever
excuse
me
i
don
t
understand
blankly
faltered
don
ippolito
no
and
i
m
afraid
i
couldn
t
explain
to
you
answered
ferris
there
was
a
silence
for
a
time
broken
at
last
by
don
ippolito
who
asked
why
do
you
not
marry
madamigella
he
seemed
not
to
feel
that
there
was
anything
out
of
the
way
in
the
question
and
ferris
was
too
well
used
to
the
childlike
directness
of
the
most
maneuvering
of
races
to
be
surprised
yet
he
was
displeased
as
he
would
not
have
been
if
don
ippolito
were
not
a
priest
he
was
not
of
the
type
of
priests
whom
the
american
knew
from
the
prejudice
and
distrust
of
the
italians
he
was
alienated
from
his
clerical
fellows
by
all
the
objects
of
his
life
and
by
a
reciprocal
dislike
about
other
priests
there
were
various
scandals
but
don
ippolito
was
like
that
pretty
of
the
piazza
of
whom
it
was
venetianly
answered
when
one
asked
if
so
sweet
a
face
were
not
innocent
oh
yes
she
is
mad
he
was
of
a
purity
so
blameless
that
he
was
reputed
by
the
that
in
venice
turns
its
searching
light
upon
whomever
you
mention
and
from
his
own
association
with
the
man
ferris
perceived
in
him
an
apparent
such
as
no
man
can
have
but
the
rarest
of
italians
he
was
the
albino
of
his
species
a
gray
crow
a
white
fly
he
was
really
this
or
he
knew
how
to
seem
it
with
an
art
far
beyond
any
common
deceit
it
was
the
half
expectation
of
coming
sometime
upon
the
lurking
duplicity
in
don
ippolito
that
continually
enfeebled
the
painter
in
his
attempts
to
portray
his
venetian
priest
and
that
gave
its
undecided
unsatisfactory
character
to
the
picture
before
him
its
weak
hardness
its
provoking
superficiality
he
expressed
the
traits
of
melancholy
and
loss
that
he
imagined
in
him
yet
he
always
was
tempted
to
leave
the
picture
with
a
touch
of
something
sinister
in
it
some
airy
and
subtle
shadow
of
selfish
design
he
stared
hard
at
don
ippolito
while
this
perplexity
filled
his
mind
for
the
hundredth
time
then
he
said
stiffly
i
don
t
know
i
don
t
want
to
marry
anybody
besides
he
added
relaxing
into
a
smile
of
helpless
amusement
it
s
possible
that
miss
vervain
might
not
want
to
marry
as
to
that
replied
don
ippolito
you
never
can
tell
all
young
girls
desire
to
be
married
i
suppose
he
continued
with
a
sigh
she
is
very
beautiful
is
she
not
it
is
seldom
that
we
see
such
a
blonde
in
italy
our
blondes
are
dark
they
have
auburn
hair
and
blue
eyes
but
their
complexions
are
thick
miss
vervain
is
blonde
as
the
morning
light
the
sun
s
gold
is
in
her
hair
his
noonday
whiteness
in
her
dazzling
throat
the
flush
of
his
coming
is
on
her
lips
she
might
utter
the
dawn
you
re
a
poet
don
ippolito
laughed
the
painter
what
property
of
the
sun
is
in
her
eyes
his
fire
ah
that
is
her
greatest
charm
those
strange
eyes
of
hers
they
seem
full
of
tragedies
she
looks
made
to
be
the
heroine
of
some
stormy
romance
and
yet
how
simply
patient
and
good
she
is
yes
said
ferris
who
often
responded
in
english
to
the
priest
s
italian
and
he
added
half
musingly
in
his
own
tongue
after
a
moment
but
i
don
t
think
it
would
be
safe
to
count
upon
her
i
m
afraid
she
has
a
bad
temper
at
any
rate
i
always
expect
to
see
smoke
somewhere
when
i
look
at
those
eyes
of
hers
she
has
wonderful
however
and
i
don
t
exactly
understand
why
perhaps
people
of
strong
impulses
have
strong
wills
to
overrule
them
it
seems
no
more
than
is
it
the
custom
asked
don
ippolito
after
a
moment
for
the
american
young
ladies
always
to
address
their
mammas
as
no
that
seems
to
be
a
peculiarity
of
miss
vervain
s
it
s
a
little
formality
that
i
should
say
served
to
hold
vervain
in
do
you
mean
that
it
repulses
her
not
at
all
i
don
t
think
i
could
explain
said
ferris
with
a
certain
air
of
regretting
to
have
gone
so
far
in
comment
on
the
vervains
he
added
recklessly
don
t
you
see
that
vervain
sometimes
does
and
says
things
that
embarrass
her
daughter
and
that
miss
vervain
seems
to
try
to
restrain
her
i
thought
returned
don
ippolito
meditatively
that
the
signorina
was
always
very
tenderly
submissive
to
her
yes
so
she
is
said
the
painter
dryly
and
looked
in
annoyance
from
the
priest
to
the
picture
and
from
the
picture
to
the
priest
after
a
minute
don
ippolito
said
they
must
be
very
rich
to
live
as
they
i
don
t
know
about
that
replied
ferris
americans
spend
and
save
in
ways
different
from
the
italians
i
dare
say
the
vervains
find
venice
very
cheap
after
london
and
paris
and
perhaps
said
don
ippolito
if
they
were
rich
you
would
be
in
a
position
to
marry
i
should
not
marry
miss
vervain
for
her
money
answered
the
painter
sharply
no
but
if
you
loved
her
the
money
would
enable
you
to
marry
listen
to
me
don
ippolito
i
never
said
that
i
loved
miss
vervain
and
i
don
t
know
how
you
feel
warranted
in
speaking
to
me
about
the
matter
why
do
you
do
so
i
why
i
could
not
but
imagine
that
you
must
love
her
is
there
anything
wrong
in
speaking
of
such
things
is
it
contrary
to
the
american
custom
i
ask
pardon
from
my
heart
if
i
have
done
anything
there
is
no
offense
said
the
painter
with
a
laugh
and
i
don
t
wonder
you
thought
i
ought
to
be
in
love
with
miss
vervain
she
beautiful
and
i
believe
she
s
good
but
if
men
had
to
marry
because
women
were
beautiful
and
good
there
isn
t
one
of
us
could
live
single
a
day
besides
i
m
the
victim
of
another
passion
i
m
laboring
under
an
unrequited
affection
for
then
you
do
love
her
asked
don
ippolito
eagerly
so
far
as
i
m
advised
at
present
no
i
don
it
is
strange
said
the
priest
absently
but
with
a
glowing
face
he
quitted
the
painter
s
and
walked
swiftly
homeward
with
a
triumphant
buoyancy
of
step
a
subtle
content
diffused
itself
over
his
face
and
a
joyful
light
burnt
in
his
deep
eyes
he
sat
down
before
the
piano
and
organ
as
he
had
arranged
them
and
began
to
strike
their
keys
in
unison
this
seemed
to
him
for
the
first
time
childish
then
he
played
some
lively
bars
on
the
piano
alone
they
sounded
too
light
and
trivial
and
he
turned
to
the
other
instrument
as
the
plaint
of
the
reeds
arose
it
filled
his
sense
like
a
solemn
and
transfigured
the
place
the
notes
swelled
to
the
ample
vault
of
a
church
and
at
the
high
altar
he
was
celebrating
the
mass
in
his
sacerdotal
robes
he
suddenly
caught
his
fingers
away
from
the
keys
his
breast
heaved
he
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
vii
ferris
stood
cleaning
his
palette
after
don
ippolito
was
gone
scraping
the
colors
together
with
his
knife
and
neatly
buttering
them
on
the
palette
s
edge
while
he
wondered
what
the
priest
meant
by
pumping
him
in
that
way
nothing
he
supposed
and
yet
it
was
odd
of
course
she
had
a
bad
temper
he
put
on
his
hat
and
coat
and
strolled
vaguely
forth
and
in
an
hour
or
two
came
by
a
roundabout
course
to
the
gondola
station
nearest
his
own
house
there
he
stopped
and
after
an
absent
contemplation
of
the
boats
from
which
the
gondoliers
were
clamoring
for
his
custom
he
stepped
into
one
and
ordered
the
man
to
row
him
to
a
gate
on
a
small
canal
opposite
the
gate
opened
at
his
ringing
into
the
garden
of
the
vervains
florida
was
sitting
alone
on
a
bench
near
the
fountain
it
was
no
longer
a
ruined
fountain
the
naiad
held
a
pipe
above
her
head
and
from
this
rose
a
willowy
spray
high
enough
to
catch
some
colors
of
the
sunset
then
striking
into
the
garden
and
fell
again
in
a
mist
around
her
making
her
almost
modest
what
does
this
mean
asked
ferris
carelessly
taking
the
young
girl
s
hand
i
thought
this
lady
s
occupation
was
don
ippolito
repaired
the
fountain
for
the
landlord
and
he
agreed
to
pay
for
filling
the
tank
that
feeds
it
said
florida
he
seems
to
think
it
a
hard
bargain
for
he
only
lets
it
play
about
half
an
hour
a
day
but
he
says
it
s
very
ingeniously
mended
he
didn
t
believe
it
could
be
done
it
pretty
it
is
indeed
said
the
painter
with
a
singular
desire
going
through
him
like
a
pang
likewise
to
do
something
for
miss
vervain
did
you
go
to
don
ippolito
s
house
the
other
day
to
see
his
traps
yes
we
were
very
much
interested
i
was
sorry
that
i
knew
so
little
about
inventions
do
you
think
there
are
many
practical
ideas
amongst
his
things
i
hope
there
are
he
seemed
so
proud
and
pleased
to
show
them
shouldn
t
you
think
he
had
some
real
inventive
talent
yes
i
think
he
has
but
i
know
as
little
about
the
matter
as
you
he
sat
down
beside
her
and
picking
up
a
twig
from
the
gravel
pulled
the
bark
off
in
silence
then
miss
vervain
he
said
knitting
his
brows
as
he
always
did
when
he
had
something
on
his
conscience
and
meant
to
ease
it
at
any
cost
i
m
the
dog
that
fetches
a
bone
and
carries
a
bone
i
talked
don
ippolito
over
with
you
the
other
day
and
now
i
ve
been
talking
you
over
with
him
but
i
ve
the
grace
to
say
that
i
m
ashamed
of
why
need
you
be
ashamed
asked
florida
you
said
no
harm
of
him
did
you
of
us
not
exactly
but
i
don
t
think
it
was
quite
my
business
to
discuss
you
at
all
i
think
you
can
t
let
people
alone
too
much
for
my
part
if
i
try
to
characterize
my
friends
i
fail
to
do
them
perfect
justice
of
course
and
yet
the
imperfect
result
remains
representative
of
them
in
my
mind
it
limits
them
and
fixes
them
and
i
can
t
get
them
back
again
into
the
undefined
and
the
ideal
where
they
really
belong
one
ought
never
to
speak
of
the
faults
of
one
s
friends
it
mutilates
them
they
can
never
be
the
same
so
you
have
been
talking
of
my
faults
said
florida
breathing
quickly
perhaps
you
could
tell
me
of
them
to
my
i
should
have
to
say
that
unfairness
was
one
of
them
but
that
is
common
to
the
whole
sex
i
never
said
i
was
talking
of
your
faults
i
declared
against
doing
so
and
you
immediately
infer
that
my
motive
is
remorse
i
don
t
know
that
you
have
any
faults
they
may
be
virtues
in
disguise
there
is
a
charm
even
in
unfairness
well
i
did
say
that
i
thought
you
had
a
quick
temper
florida
colored
violently
but
now
i
see
that
i
was
mistaken
said
ferris
with
a
laugh
may
i
ask
what
else
you
said
demanded
the
young
girl
haughtily
oh
that
would
be
a
betrayal
of
confidence
said
ferris
unaffected
by
her
hauteur
then
why
have
you
mentioned
the
matter
to
me
at
all
i
wanted
to
clear
my
conscience
i
suppose
and
sin
again
i
wanted
to
talk
with
you
about
don
florida
looked
with
perplexity
at
ferris
s
face
while
her
own
slowly
cooled
and
paled
what
did
you
want
to
say
of
him
she
asked
calmly
i
hardly
know
how
to
put
it
that
he
puzzles
me
to
begin
with
you
know
i
feel
somewhat
responsible
for
of
course
i
never
should
have
thought
of
him
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
your
mother
s
talk
that
morning
coming
back
from
san
i
know
said
florida
with
a
faint
blush
and
yet
don
t
you
see
it
was
as
much
a
fancy
of
mine
a
weakness
for
the
man
himself
as
the
desire
to
serve
your
mother
that
prompted
me
to
bring
him
to
yes
i
see
answered
the
young
girl
i
acted
in
the
teeth
of
a
bitter
venetian
prejudice
against
priests
all
my
friends
here
they
re
mostly
young
men
with
the
modern
italian
ideas
or
old
liberals
hate
and
despise
the
priests
they
believe
that
priests
are
full
of
guile
and
deceit
that
they
are
spies
for
the
austrians
and
altogether
don
ippolito
is
welcome
to
report
our
most
secret
thoughts
to
the
police
said
florida
whose
look
of
rising
alarm
relaxed
into
a
smile
oh
cried
the
painter
how
you
leap
to
conclusions
i
never
intimated
that
don
ippolito
was
a
spy
on
the
contrary
it
was
his
difference
from
other
priests
that
made
me
think
of
him
for
a
moment
he
seems
to
be
as
much
cut
off
from
the
church
as
from
the
world
and
yet
he
is
a
priest
with
a
priest
s
education
what
if
i
should
have
been
altogether
mistaken
he
is
either
one
of
the
openest
souls
in
the
world
as
you
have
insisted
or
he
is
one
of
the
i
should
not
be
afraid
of
him
in
any
case
said
florida
but
i
can
t
believe
any
wrong
of
ferris
frowned
in
annoyance
i
don
t
want
you
to
i
don
t
myself
i
ve
bungled
the
matter
as
i
might
have
known
i
would
i
was
trying
to
put
into
words
an
undefined
uneasiness
of
mine
a
quite
formless
desire
to
have
you
possessed
of
the
whole
case
as
it
had
come
up
in
my
mind
i
ve
made
a
mess
of
it
said
ferris
rising
with
a
rueful
air
besides
i
ought
to
have
spoken
to
oh
no
cried
florida
eagerly
springing
to
her
feet
beside
him
don
t
little
things
wear
upon
my
mother
so
i
m
glad
you
didn
t
speak
to
her
i
don
t
misunderstand
you
i
think
i
expressed
myself
badly
she
added
with
an
anxious
face
i
thank
you
very
much
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
by
ferris
s
impulse
they
both
began
to
move
down
the
garden
path
toward
the
the
sunset
had
faded
out
of
the
fountain
but
it
still
lit
the
whole
heaven
in
whose
vast
blue
depths
hung
light
whiffs
of
pinkish
cloud
as
ethereal
as
the
draperies
that
floated
after
miss
vervain
as
she
walked
with
a
splendid
grace
beside
him
no
awkwardness
now
or
in
her
as
she
turned
to
ferris
and
asked
in
her
deep
tones
to
which
some
latent
feeling
imparted
a
slight
tremor
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
the
sense
of
her
willingness
to
be
bidden
by
him
gave
him
a
delicious
thrill
he
looked
at
the
superb
creature
so
proud
so
helpless
so
much
a
woman
so
much
a
child
and
he
caught
his
breath
before
he
answered
her
gauzes
blew
about
his
feet
in
the
light
breeze
that
lifted
the
foliage
she
was
a
little
and
in
her
eagerness
she
drew
closer
to
him
fixing
her
eyes
full
upon
his
with
a
bold
innocence
good
heavens
miss
vervain
he
cried
with
a
sudden
blush
it
isn
t
a
serious
matter
i
m
a
fool
to
have
spoken
to
you
don
t
do
anything
let
things
go
on
as
before
it
isn
t
for
me
to
instruct
i
should
have
been
very
glad
of
your
advice
she
said
with
a
disappointed
almost
wounded
manner
keeping
her
eyes
upon
him
it
seems
to
me
we
are
always
going
wrong
she
stopped
short
with
a
flush
and
then
a
pallor
ferris
returned
her
look
with
one
of
comical
dismay
this
apparent
readiness
of
miss
vervain
s
to
be
taken
command
of
daunted
him
on
second
thoughts
i
wish
you
d
dismiss
all
my
stupid
talk
from
your
mind
he
said
i
feel
as
if
i
d
been
guiltily
trying
to
set
you
against
a
man
whom
i
like
very
much
and
have
no
reason
not
to
trust
and
who
thinks
me
so
much
his
friend
that
he
couldn
t
dream
of
my
making
any
sort
of
trouble
for
him
it
would
break
his
heart
i
m
afraid
if
you
treated
him
in
a
different
way
from
that
in
which
you
ve
treated
him
till
now
it
s
really
touching
to
listen
to
his
gratitude
to
you
and
your
mother
it
s
only
conceivable
on
the
ground
that
he
has
never
had
friends
before
in
the
world
he
seems
like
another
man
or
the
same
man
come
to
life
and
it
isn
t
his
fault
that
he
s
a
priest
i
suppose
he
added
with
a
sort
of
final
throe
that
a
venetian
family
wouldn
t
use
him
with
the
frank
hospitality
you
ve
shown
not
because
they
distrusted
him
at
all
perhaps
but
because
they
would
be
afraid
of
other
venetian
this
ultimate
drop
of
venom
helplessly
distilled
did
not
seem
to
rankle
in
miss
vervain
s
mind
she
walked
now
with
her
face
turned
from
his
and
she
answered
coldly
we
shall
not
be
troubled
we
don
t
care
for
venetian
they
were
at
the
gate
said
ferris
abruptly
i
m
won
t
you
wait
and
see
my
mother
asked
florida
with
her
awkward
again
upon
her
no
thanks
said
ferris
gloomily
i
haven
t
time
i
just
dropped
in
for
a
moment
to
blast
an
innocent
man
s
reputation
and
destroy
a
young
lady
s
peace
of
then
you
needn
t
go
yet
answered
florida
coldly
for
you
haven
t
well
i
ve
done
my
worst
returned
ferris
drawing
the
bolt
he
went
away
hanging
his
head
in
amazement
and
disgust
at
himself
for
his
clumsiness
and
bad
taste
it
seemed
to
him
a
contemptible
part
first
to
embarrass
them
with
don
ippolito
s
acquaintance
if
it
was
an
embarrassment
and
then
try
to
sneak
out
of
his
responsibility
by
these
tardy
cautions
and
if
it
was
not
going
to
be
an
embarrassment
it
was
folly
to
have
approached
the
matter
at
all
what
had
he
wanted
to
do
and
with
what
motive
he
hardly
knew
as
he
battled
the
ground
over
and
over
again
nothing
comforted
him
save
the
thought
that
bad
as
it
was
to
have
spoken
to
miss
vervain
it
must
have
been
infinitely
worse
to
speak
to
her
mother
viii
it
was
late
before
ferris
forgot
his
chagrin
in
sleep
and
when
he
woke
the
next
morning
the
sun
was
making
the
solid
green
blinds
at
his
window
odorous
of
their
native
pine
woods
with
its
heat
and
thrusting
a
golden
spear
at
the
heart
of
don
ippolito
s
effigy
where
he
had
left
it
on
the
easel
marina
brought
a
letter
with
his
coffee
the
letter
was
from
vervain
and
it
entreated
him
to
come
to
lunch
at
twelve
and
then
join
them
on
an
excursion
of
which
they
had
all
often
talked
up
the
canal
of
the
brenta
don
ippolito
has
got
his
permission
think
of
his
not
being
able
to
go
to
the
mainland
without
the
patriarch
s
leave
and
can
go
with
us
so
i
try
to
make
this
hasty
arrangement
you
come
it
all
depends
upon
yes
so
it
seems
groaned
the
painter
and
went
in
the
garden
he
found
don
ippolito
and
florida
at
the
fountain
where
he
had
himself
parted
with
her
the
evening
before
and
he
observed
with
a
guilty
relief
that
don
ippolito
was
talking
to
her
in
the
happy
unconsciousness
habitual
with
him
florida
cast
at
the
painter
a
swift
glance
of
latent
appeal
and
intelligence
which
he
refused
and
in
the
same
instant
she
met
him
with
another
look
as
if
she
now
saw
him
for
the
first
time
and
gave
him
her
hand
in
greeting
it
was
a
beautiful
hand
he
could
not
help
worshipping
its
lovely
forms
and
the
lily
whiteness
and
softness
of
the
back
the
rose
of
the
palm
and
she
idly
resumed
the
great
venetian
fan
which
hung
from
her
waist
by
a
chain
don
ippolito
has
been
talking
about
the
villeggiatura
on
the
brenta
in
the
old
days
she
explained
oh
yes
said
the
painter
they
used
to
have
merry
times
in
the
villas
then
and
it
was
worth
while
being
a
priest
or
at
least
an
abbate
di
casa
i
should
think
you
would
sigh
for
a
return
of
those
good
old
days
don
ippolito
just
imagine
if
you
were
abbate
di
casa
with
some
patrician
family
about
the
close
of
the
last
century
you
might
be
the
instructor
companion
and
spiritual
adviser
of
illustrissima
at
the
theatres
and
masquerades
all
winter
and
at
this
season
instead
of
going
up
the
brenta
for
a
day
s
pleasure
with
us
barbarous
yankees
you
might
be
setting
out
with
illustrissima
and
all
the
strissimi
and
strissime
big
and
little
for
a
spring
villeggiatura
there
you
would
be
going
in
a
gilded
barge
with
songs
and
fiddles
and
dancing
instead
of
a
common
gondola
and
you
would
stay
a
month
walking
going
to
parties
and
caffès
drinking
chocolate
and
lemonade
gaming
sonneteering
and
butterflying
about
it
was
doubtless
a
beautiful
life
answered
the
priest
with
simple
indifference
but
i
never
have
thought
of
it
with
regret
because
i
have
been
preoccupied
with
other
ideas
than
those
of
social
pleasures
though
perhaps
they
were
no
florida
had
watched
don
ippolito
s
face
while
ferris
was
speaking
and
she
now
asked
gravely
but
don
t
you
think
their
life
nowadays
is
more
becoming
to
the
clergy
why
madamigella
what
harm
was
there
in
those
gayeties
i
suppose
the
bad
features
of
the
old
life
are
exaggerated
to
they
couldn
t
have
been
worse
than
the
amusements
of
the
english
parsons
about
the
same
time
said
ferris
besides
the
abbate
di
casa
had
a
charm
of
his
own
the
charm
of
all
things
which
whatever
you
may
say
of
them
are
somehow
elegant
and
refined
or
at
least
refer
to
elegance
and
refinement
i
don
t
say
they
re
ennobling
but
they
re
fascinating
i
don
t
respect
them
but
i
love
them
when
i
think
about
the
past
of
venice
i
don
t
care
so
much
to
see
any
of
the
heroically
historical
things
but
i
should
like
immensely
to
have
looked
in
at
the
ridotto
when
the
place
was
at
its
gayest
with
wigs
and
masks
hoops
and
fans
and
rapiers
bows
and
courtesies
whispers
and
glances
i
dare
say
i
should
have
found
don
ippolito
there
in
some
becoming
florida
looked
from
the
painter
to
the
priest
and
back
to
the
painter
as
ferris
spoke
and
then
she
turned
a
little
anxiously
toward
the
terrace
and
a
shadow
slipped
from
her
face
as
her
mother
came
rustling
down
the
steps
catching
at
her
drapery
and
shaking
it
into
place
the
young
girl
hurried
to
meet
her
lifted
her
arms
for
what
promised
an
embrace
and
with
firm
hands
set
the
elder
lady
s
bonnet
straight
with
her
forehead
i
m
always
getting
it
on
askew
vervain
said
for
greeting
to
ferris
how
do
you
do
don
ippolito
but
i
suppose
you
think
i
ve
kept
you
long
enough
to
get
it
on
straight
for
once
so
i
have
i
a
fuss
and
i
don
t
deny
it
at
my
time
of
life
it
s
much
harder
to
make
yourself
shipshape
than
it
is
when
you
re
younger
i
tell
florida
that
anybody
would
take
for
the
lady
she
does
seem
to
give
so
little
care
to
getting
up
an
and
yet
she
has
the
effect
of
a
stylish
young
person
in
the
bloom
of
youth
observed
ferris
with
a
touch
of
caricature
we
had
better
lunch
with
our
things
on
said
vervain
and
then
there
needn
t
be
any
delay
in
starting
i
thought
we
would
have
it
here
she
added
as
nina
and
the
appeared
with
trays
of
dishes
and
cups
so
that
we
can
start
in
a
real
picnicky
spirit
i
knew
you
d
think
it
a
womanish
lunch
ferris
don
ippolito
likes
what
we
do
and
so
i
ve
provided
you
with
a
chicken
salad
and
i
m
going
to
ask
you
for
a
taste
of
it
i
m
really
there
was
salad
for
all
in
fact
and
it
was
quite
one
o
clock
before
the
lunch
was
ended
and
wraps
of
just
the
right
thickness
and
thinness
were
chosen
and
the
party
were
comfortably
placed
under
the
striped
linen
canopy
of
the
gondola
which
they
had
from
a
public
station
the
being
engaged
that
day
they
rowed
through
the
narrow
canal
skirting
the
garden
out
into
the
expanse
before
the
giudecca
and
then
struck
across
the
lagoon
towards
fusina
past
the
of
san
giorgio
in
alga
whose
beautiful
tower
has
flushed
and
darkened
in
so
many
pictures
of
venetian
sunsets
and
past
the
austrian
lagoon
forts
with
their
coronets
of
guns
threatening
every
point
and
the
croatian
sentinels
pacing
to
and
fro
on
their
walls
they
stopped
long
enough
at
one
of
the
customs
barges
to
declare
to
the
swarthy
amiable
officers
the
innocence
of
their
freight
and
at
the
mouth
of
the
canal
of
the
brenta
they
paused
before
the
station
while
a
policeman
came
out
and
scanned
them
he
bowed
to
don
ippolito
s
cloth
and
then
they
began
to
push
up
the
sluggish
canal
shallow
and
overrun
with
weeds
and
mosses
into
the
heart
of
the
land
the
spring
which
in
venice
comes
in
the
softening
air
and
the
perpetual
azure
of
the
heavens
was
renewed
to
their
senses
in
all
its
miraculous
loveliness
the
garden
of
the
vervains
had
indeed
confessed
it
in
opulence
of
leaf
and
bloom
but
there
it
seemed
somehow
only
like
a
novel
effect
of
the
artifice
which
had
been
able
to
create
a
garden
in
that
city
of
stone
and
sea
here
a
vernal
world
suddenly
opened
before
them
with
fields
of
green
under
a
dome
of
perfect
blue
against
its
walls
only
the
soft
curves
of
hills
were
traced
and
near
at
hand
the
tender
forms
of
trees
the
long
garland
of
vines
that
festoons
all
italy
seemed
to
begin
in
the
neighboring
orchards
the
meadows
waved
their
tall
grasses
in
the
sun
and
broke
in
poppies
as
the
break
in
iridescent
spray
the
maize
shook
its
gleaming
blades
in
the
light
the
poplars
marched
in
stately
procession
on
either
side
of
the
straight
white
road
to
padua
till
they
vanished
in
the
long
perspective
the
blossoms
had
fallen
from
the
trees
many
weeks
before
but
the
air
was
full
of
the
vague
sweetness
of
the
perfect
spring
which
here
and
there
gathered
and
defined
itself
as
the
spicy
odor
of
the
grass
cut
on
the
shore
of
the
canal
and
drying
in
the
mellow
heat
of
the
sun
the
voyagers
spoke
from
time
to
time
of
some
peculiarity
of
the
villas
that
succeeded
each
other
along
the
canal
don
ippolito
knew
a
few
of
them
the
gondoliers
knew
others
but
after
all
their
names
were
nothing
these
haunts
of
splendor
and
idleness
weary
of
themselves
and
unable
to
escape
are
sadder
than
anything
in
venice
and
they
belonged
as
far
as
the
americans
were
concerned
to
a
world
as
strange
as
any
to
which
they
should
go
in
another
life
the
world
of
a
faded
fashion
and
an
alien
history
some
of
the
villas
were
kept
in
a
sort
of
repair
some
were
even
maintained
in
the
state
of
old
but
the
most
showed
marks
of
greater
or
less
decay
and
here
and
there
one
was
falling
to
ruin
they
had
gardens
about
them
tangled
and
a
population
of
decrepit
statues
in
the
rococo
taste
strolled
in
their
walks
or
simpered
from
their
gates
two
or
three
houses
seemed
to
be
occupied
the
rest
stood
empty
each
close
latticed
to
the
brooding
heat
and
silent
in
its
dusty
the
had
no
fixed
plan
for
the
day
further
than
to
ascend
the
canal
and
by
and
by
take
a
carriage
at
some
convenient
village
and
drive
to
the
famous
villa
pisani
at
strà
these
houses
are
very
well
said
don
ippolito
who
had
visited
the
villa
once
and
with
whom
it
had
remained
a
memory
almost
as
signal
as
that
night
in
padua
when
he
wore
civil
dress
but
it
is
at
strà
you
see
something
really
worthy
of
the
royal
splendor
of
the
patricians
of
venice
royal
the
villa
is
now
one
of
the
palaces
of
the
of
austria
who
does
not
find
it
less
imperial
than
his
other
don
ippolito
had
celebrated
the
villa
at
strà
in
this
strain
ever
since
they
had
spoken
of
going
up
the
brenta
now
it
was
the
magnificent
conservatories
and
orangeries
that
he
sang
now
the
vast
garden
with
its
statued
walks
between
rows
of
clipt
cedars
and
firs
now
the
stables
with
their
stalls
for
numberless
horses
now
the
palace
itself
with
its
frescoed
halls
and
treasures
of
art
and
vertu
his
enthusiasm
for
the
villa
at
strà
had
become
an
amiable
jest
with
the
americans
ferris
laughed
at
his
fresh
outburst
he
declared
himself
tired
of
the
gondola
and
he
asked
florida
to
disembark
with
him
and
walk
under
the
trees
of
a
pleasant
street
running
on
one
side
between
the
villas
and
the
canal
we
are
going
to
find
something
much
grander
than
the
villa
pisani
he
boasted
with
a
look
at
don
ippolito
as
they
sauntered
along
the
path
together
they
came
now
and
then
to
a
stately
palace
like
that
of
the
contarini
where
the
lions
that
give
their
name
to
one
branch
of
the
family
crouch
in
stone
before
the
grand
portal
but
most
of
the
houses
were
interesting
only
from
their
unstoried
possibilities
to
the
imagination
they
were
generally
of
stucco
and
glared
with
fresh
whitewash
through
the
foliage
of
their
gardens
when
a
peasant
s
cottage
broke
their
line
it
gave
with
its
barns
and
and
its
beds
of
a
homely
relief
from
the
decaying
gentility
of
the
villas
what
a
pity
miss
vervain
said
the
painter
that
the
blessings
of
this
world
should
be
so
unequally
divided
why
should
all
this
sketchable
adversity
be
lavished
upon
the
neighborhood
of
a
city
that
is
so
rich
as
venice
in
picturesque
dilapidation
it
s
pretty
hard
on
us
americans
and
forces
people
of
sensibility
into
exile
what
wouldn
t
cultivated
persons
give
for
a
stretch
of
this
street
in
the
suburbs
of
boston
or
of
your
own
providence
i
suppose
the
new
yorkers
will
be
setting
up
something
of
the
kind
one
of
these
days
and
giving
it
a
french
name
they
ll
call
it
bords
du
there
was
one
of
them
carried
back
a
gondola
the
other
day
to
put
on
a
pond
in
their
new
park
but
the
worst
of
it
is
you
can
t
take
home
the
sentiment
of
these
i
thought
it
was
the
business
of
painters
to
send
home
the
sentiment
of
them
in
pictures
said
florida
ferris
talked
to
her
in
this
way
because
it
was
his
way
of
talking
it
always
surprised
him
a
little
that
she
entered
into
the
spirit
of
it
he
was
not
quite
sure
that
she
did
he
sometimes
thought
she
waited
till
she
could
seize
upon
a
point
to
turn
against
him
and
so
give
herself
the
air
of
having
comprehended
the
whole
he
laughed
oh
yes
a
poor
little
fragmentary
reproduction
of
their
sentiment
which
is
as
moonlight
unto
sunlight
and
as
water
unto
wine
when
compared
with
the
real
thing
suppose
i
made
a
picture
of
this
very
bit
ourselves
in
the
foreground
looking
at
the
garden
over
there
where
that
amusing
vandal
of
an
owner
has
just
had
his
statues
painted
white
would
our
friends
at
home
understand
it
a
whole
history
must
be
left
unexpressed
i
could
only
hint
at
an
entire
situation
of
course
people
with
a
taste
for
olives
would
get
the
flavor
but
even
they
would
wonder
that
i
chose
such
an
unsuggestive
bit
why
it
is
just
the
most
maddeningly
suggestive
thing
to
be
found
here
and
if
i
may
put
it
modestly
for
my
share
in
it
i
think
we
two
young
americans
looking
on
at
this
supreme
excess
of
the
rococo
are
the
very
essence
of
the
sentiment
of
the
scene
but
what
would
the
honored
connoisseurs
the
good
folks
who
get
themselves
up
on
ruskin
and
try
so
honestly
hard
to
have
some
little
ideas
about
art
make
of
us
to
be
sure
they
might
justifiably
praise
the
grace
of
your
pose
if
i
were
so
lucky
as
to
catch
it
and
your
way
of
putting
your
hand
under
the
elbow
of
the
arm
that
holds
your
parasol
florida
seemed
disdainfully
to
keep
her
attitude
and
the
painter
smiled
but
they
wouldn
t
know
what
it
all
meant
and
couldn
t
imagine
that
we
were
inspired
by
this
rascally
little
villa
to
sigh
longingly
over
the
wicked
excuse
me
interrupted
florida
with
a
touch
of
trouble
in
her
proud
manner
i
m
not
sighing
over
it
for
one
and
i
don
t
want
it
back
i
m
glad
that
i
m
american
and
that
there
is
no
past
for
me
i
can
t
understand
how
you
and
don
ippolito
can
speak
so
tolerantly
of
what
no
one
can
respect
she
added
in
almost
an
aggrieved
tone
if
miss
vervain
wanted
to
turn
the
talk
upon
don
ippolito
ferris
by
no
means
did
he
had
had
enough
of
that
subject
yesterday
he
got
as
lightly
away
from
it
as
he
could
oh
don
ippolito
s
a
pagan
i
tell
you
and
i
m
a
painter
and
the
rococo
is
my
weakness
i
wish
i
could
paint
it
but
i
can
t
i
m
a
hundred
years
too
late
i
couldn
t
even
paint
myself
in
the
act
of
sentimentalizing
while
he
talked
he
had
been
making
a
few
lines
in
a
small
pocket
with
a
furtive
glance
or
two
at
florida
when
they
returned
to
the
boat
he
busied
himself
again
with
the
book
and
presently
he
handed
it
to
vervain
why
it
s
florida
cried
the
lady
how
very
nicely
you
do
sketch
thanks
vervain
you
re
always
flattering
no
but
seriously
i
that
i
had
paid
more
attention
to
my
drawing
when
i
was
a
girl
and
now
florida
she
won
t
touch
a
pencil
i
wish
you
d
talk
to
her
oh
people
who
are
pictures
needn
t
trouble
themselves
to
be
painters
said
ferris
with
a
little
burlesque
vervain
began
to
look
at
the
sketch
through
her
tubed
hand
the
painter
made
a
grimace
but
you
ve
made
her
too
proud
ferris
she
doesn
t
look
like
yes
she
does
to
those
unworthy
of
her
kindness
i
have
taken
miss
vervain
in
the
act
of
scorning
the
rococo
and
its
humble
admirer
me
with
i
m
sure
don
t
know
what
you
mean
ferris
but
i
can
t
think
that
this
proud
look
is
habitual
with
florida
and
i
ve
heard
people
say
very
good
judges
that
an
artist
oughtn
t
to
perpetuate
a
temporary
expression
something
like
it
can
t
be
helped
now
vervain
the
sketch
is
irretrievably
immortal
i
m
sorry
but
it
s
too
oh
stuff
as
if
you
couldn
t
turn
up
the
corners
of
the
mouth
a
little
or
and
give
her
the
appearance
of
laughing
at
me
never
don
ippolito
said
vervain
turning
to
the
priest
who
had
been
listening
intently
to
all
this
trivial
talk
what
do
you
think
of
this
sketch
he
took
the
book
with
an
eager
hand
and
perused
the
sketch
as
if
trying
to
read
some
secret
there
after
a
minute
he
handed
it
back
with
a
light
sigh
apparently
of
relief
but
said
nothing
well
asked
vervain
oh
i
ask
pardon
no
it
isn
t
my
idea
of
madamigella
it
seems
to
me
that
her
likeness
must
be
sketched
in
color
those
lines
are
true
but
they
need
color
to
subdue
them
they
go
too
far
they
are
more
than
you
re
quite
right
don
ippolito
said
ferris
then
don
t
think
she
always
has
this
proud
look
pursued
vervain
the
painter
fancied
that
florida
quelled
in
herself
a
movement
of
impatience
he
looked
at
her
with
an
amused
smile
not
always
no
answered
don
ippolito
sometimes
her
face
expresses
the
greatest
meekness
in
the
but
not
at
the
present
moment
thought
ferris
fascinated
by
the
stare
of
angry
pride
which
the
girl
bent
upon
the
unconscious
priest
though
i
confess
that
i
should
hardly
know
how
to
characterize
her
habitual
expression
added
don
ippolito
thanks
said
florida
peremptorily
i
m
tired
of
the
subject
it
isn
t
an
important
oh
yes
it
is
my
dear
said
vervain
at
least
it
s
important
to
me
if
it
isn
t
to
you
for
i
m
your
mother
and
really
if
i
thought
you
looked
like
this
as
a
general
thing
to
a
casual
observer
i
should
consider
it
a
reflection
upon
ferris
gave
a
provoking
laugh
as
she
continued
sweetly
i
must
insist
don
ippolito
now
did
you
ever
see
florida
look
so
the
girl
leaned
back
and
began
to
wave
her
fan
slowly
to
and
fro
before
her
face
i
never
saw
her
look
so
with
you
dear
madama
said
the
priest
with
an
anxious
glance
at
florida
who
let
her
fan
fall
folded
into
her
lap
and
sat
still
he
went
on
with
priestly
smoothness
and
a
touch
of
something
like
invoked
authority
such
as
a
man
might
show
who
could
dispense
indulgences
and
inflict
penances
no
one
could
help
seeing
her
devotedness
to
you
and
i
have
admired
from
the
first
an
obedience
and
tenderness
that
i
have
never
known
equaled
in
all
her
relations
to
you
madamigella
has
seemed
to
me
florida
started
forward
you
are
not
asked
to
comment
on
my
behavior
to
my
mother
you
are
not
invited
to
speak
of
my
conduct
at
all
she
burst
out
with
sudden
violence
her
visage
flaming
and
her
blue
eyes
burning
upon
don
ippolito
who
shrank
from
the
astonishing
rudeness
as
from
a
blow
in
the
face
what
is
it
to
you
how
i
treat
my
mother
she
sank
back
again
upon
the
cushions
and
opening
the
fan
with
a
clash
swept
it
swiftly
before
her
florida
said
her
mother
gravely
ferris
turned
away
in
cold
disgust
like
one
who
has
witnessed
a
cruelty
done
to
some
helpless
thing
don
ippolito
s
speech
was
not
fortunate
at
the
best
but
it
might
have
come
from
a
foreigner
s
misapprehension
and
at
the
worst
it
was
and
the
girl
is
a
perfect
brute
as
i
thought
in
the
beginning
the
painter
said
to
himself
how
could
i
have
ever
thought
differently
i
shall
have
to
tell
don
ippolito
that
i
m
ashamed
of
her
and
disclaim
all
responsibility
pah
i
wish
i
was
out
of
the
pleasure
of
the
day
was
dead
it
could
not
rally
from
that
stroke
they
went
on
to
strà
as
they
had
planned
but
the
glory
of
the
villa
pisani
was
eclipsed
for
don
ippolito
he
plainly
did
not
know
what
to
do
he
did
not
address
florida
again
whose
savagery
he
would
not
probably
have
known
how
to
resent
if
he
had
wished
to
resent
it
vervain
prattled
away
to
him
with
unrelenting
kindness
ferris
kept
near
him
and
with
affectionate
zeal
tried
to
make
him
talk
of
the
villa
but
neither
the
frescoes
nor
the
orangeries
nor
the
nor
the
stables
nor
the
gardens
could
rouse
him
from
the
listless
daze
in
which
he
moved
though
ferris
found
them
all
as
wonderful
as
he
had
said
amidst
this
heavy
embarrassment
no
one
seemed
at
ease
but
the
author
of
it
she
did
not
to
be
sure
speak
to
don
ippolito
but
she
followed
her
mother
as
usual
with
her
assiduous
cares
and
she
appeared
tranquilly
unconscious
of
the
sarcastic
civility
with
which
ferris
rendered
her
any
service
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
they
got
back
to
their
boat
and
began
to
descend
the
canal
towards
venice
and
long
before
they
reached
fusina
the
day
had
passed
a
sunset
of
melancholy
red
streaked
with
level
lines
of
murky
cloud
stretched
across
the
flats
behind
them
and
faintly
tinged
with
its
reflected
light
the
eastern
horizon
which
the
towers
and
domes
of
venice
had
not
yet
begun
to
break
the
twilight
came
and
then
through
the
overcast
heavens
the
moon
shone
dim
a
light
blossomed
here
and
there
in
the
villas
distant
voices
called
musically
a
cow
lowed
a
dog
barked
the
rich
sweet
breath
of
the
vernal
land
mingled
its
odors
with
the
sultry
air
of
the
neighboring
lagoon
the
wayfarers
spoke
little
the
time
hung
heavy
on
all
no
doubt
to
ferris
it
was
a
burden
almost
intolerable
to
hear
the
creak
of
the
oars
and
the
breathing
of
the
gondoliers
keeping
time
together
at
last
the
boat
stopped
in
front
of
the
in
fusina
a
soldier
with
a
sword
at
his
side
and
a
lantern
in
his
hand
came
out
and
briefly
parleyed
with
the
gondoliers
they
stepped
ashore
and
he
marched
them
into
the
station
before
him
we
have
nothing
left
to
wish
for
now
said
ferris
breaking
into
an
ironical
laugh
what
does
it
all
mean
asked
vervain
i
think
i
had
better
go
we
will
go
with
you
said
vervain
pazienza
replied
ferris
the
ladies
rose
but
don
ippolito
remained
seated
aren
t
you
going
too
don
ippolito
asked
vervain
thanks
madama
but
i
prefer
to
stay
lamentable
cries
and
shrieks
as
if
the
prisoners
had
immediately
been
put
to
the
torture
came
from
the
station
as
ferris
opened
the
door
a
lamp
of
petroleum
lighted
the
scene
and
shone
upon
the
figures
of
two
fishermen
who
bewailed
themselves
unintelligibly
in
the
vibrant
accents
of
chiozza
and
from
time
to
time
advanced
upon
the
gondoliers
and
shook
their
heads
and
beat
their
breasts
at
them
a
few
reclined
upon
benches
about
the
room
and
surveyed
the
spectacle
with
mild
impassibility
ferris
politely
asked
one
of
them
the
cause
of
the
detention
why
you
see
signore
answered
the
guard
amiably
these
honest
men
accuse
your
gondoliers
of
having
stolen
a
rope
out
of
their
boat
at
it
was
my
blood
you
know
howled
the
elder
of
the
fishermen
tossing
his
arms
wildly
abroad
it
was
my
own
heart
he
cried
letting
the
last
vowel
die
away
and
rise
again
in
mournful
refrain
while
he
stared
tragically
into
ferris
s
face
what
the
matter
asked
vervain
putting
up
her
glasses
and
trying
with
graceful
futility
to
focus
the
melodrama
nothing
said
ferris
our
gondoliers
have
had
the
heart
s
blood
of
this
respectable
dervish
that
is
to
say
they
have
stolen
a
rope
belonging
to
gondoliers
i
don
t
believe
it
they
ve
no
right
to
keep
us
here
all
night
tell
them
you
re
the
american
i
d
rather
not
try
my
dignity
on
these
underlings
vervain
there
s
no
american
squadron
here
that
i
could
order
to
bombard
fusina
if
they
didn
t
mind
me
but
i
ll
see
what
i
can
do
further
in
quality
of
courteous
foreigner
can
you
perhaps
tell
me
how
long
you
will
be
obliged
to
detain
us
here
he
asked
of
the
guard
again
i
am
very
sorry
to
detain
you
at
all
signore
but
what
can
i
do
the
commissary
is
unhappily
absent
he
may
be
here
the
guard
renewed
his
apathetic
contemplation
of
the
gondoliers
who
did
not
speak
a
word
the
windy
lamentation
of
the
fishermen
rose
and
fell
fitfully
presently
they
went
out
of
doors
and
poured
forth
their
wrongs
to
the
moon
the
room
was
close
and
with
some
trouble
ferris
persuaded
vervain
to
return
to
the
gondola
florida
seconding
his
arguments
with
gentle
good
sense
it
seemed
a
long
time
till
the
commissary
came
but
his
coming
instantly
simplified
the
situation
perhaps
because
he
had
never
been
able
to
befriend
a
consul
in
trouble
before
he
befriended
ferris
to
the
utmost
he
had
met
him
with
rather
a
browbeating
air
but
after
a
glance
at
his
card
he
gave
a
kind
of
roar
of
deprecation
and
apology
he
had
the
ladies
and
don
ippolito
in
out
of
the
gondola
and
led
them
to
an
upper
chamber
where
he
made
them
all
repose
their
honored
persons
upon
his
sofas
he
ordered
up
his
housekeeper
to
make
them
coffee
which
he
served
with
his
own
hands
excusing
its
hurried
feebleness
and
he
stood
by
rubbing
his
palms
together
and
smiling
while
they
refreshed
themselves
they
need
never
tell
me
again
that
the
austrians
are
tyrants
said
vervain
in
undertone
to
the
consul
it
was
not
easy
for
ferris
to
remind
his
host
of
the
malefactors
but
he
brought
himself
to
this
ungraciousness
the
commissary
begged
pardon
and
asked
him
to
accompany
him
below
where
he
confronted
the
accused
and
the
accusers
the
tragedy
was
acted
over
again
with
effectiveness
by
the
chiozzotti
the
gondoliers
maintaining
the
calm
of
conscious
innocence
ferris
felt
outraged
by
the
charge
against
them
listen
you
others
the
prisoners
said
the
commissary
your
padrone
is
anxious
to
return
to
venice
and
i
wish
to
inflict
no
further
displeasures
upon
him
restore
their
rope
to
these
honest
men
and
go
about
your
the
injured
gondoliers
spoke
in
low
tones
together
then
one
of
them
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
went
out
he
came
back
in
a
moment
and
laid
a
rope
before
the
commissary
is
that
the
rope
he
asked
we
found
it
floating
down
the
canal
and
picked
it
up
that
we
might
give
it
to
the
rightful
owner
but
now
i
wish
to
heaven
we
had
let
it
sink
to
the
bottom
of
the
oh
a
beautiful
story
wailed
the
chiozzoti
they
flung
themselves
upon
the
rope
and
lugged
it
off
to
their
boat
and
the
gondoliers
went
out
too
the
commissary
turned
to
ferris
with
an
amiable
smile
i
am
sorry
that
those
rogues
should
escape
said
the
american
oh
said
the
italian
they
are
poor
fellows
it
is
a
little
matter
i
am
glad
to
have
served
he
took
leave
of
his
involuntary
guests
with
effusion
following
them
with
a
lantern
to
the
gondola
vervain
to
whom
ferris
gave
an
account
of
this
trial
as
they
set
out
again
on
their
return
had
no
mind
save
for
the
magical
effect
of
his
consular
quality
upon
the
commissary
and
accused
him
of
a
vain
and
culpable
modesty
ah
said
the
diplomatist
there
s
nothing
like
knowing
just
when
to
produce
your
dignity
there
are
some
officials
who
know
too
little
like
those
guards
and
there
are
some
who
know
too
much
like
the
commissary
s
superiors
but
he
is
just
in
that
golden
mean
of
ignorance
where
he
supposes
a
consul
is
a
person
of
vervain
disputed
this
and
ferris
submitted
in
silence
presently
as
they
skirted
the
shore
to
get
their
bearings
for
the
route
across
the
lagoon
a
fierce
voice
in
venetian
shouted
from
the
darkness
indrio
indrio
back
back
and
a
gleam
of
the
moon
through
the
pale
watery
clouds
revealed
the
figure
of
a
gendarme
on
the
nearest
point
of
land
the
gondoliers
bent
to
their
oars
and
sent
the
boat
swiftly
out
into
the
lagoon
there
for
example
is
a
person
who
would
be
quite
insensible
to
my
greatness
even
if
i
had
the
consular
seal
in
my
pocket
to
him
we
are
possible
smugglers
footnote
under
the
austrians
venice
was
a
free
port
but
everything
carried
there
to
the
mainland
was
liable
to
duty
and
i
must
say
he
continued
taking
out
his
watch
and
staring
hard
at
it
that
if
i
were
a
disinterested
person
and
heard
his
suspicion
met
with
the
explanation
that
we
were
a
little
party
out
here
for
pleasure
at
half
past
twelve
i
should
say
he
was
right
at
any
rate
we
won
t
engage
him
in
controversy
quick
quick
he
added
to
the
gondoliers
glancing
at
the
receding
shore
and
then
at
the
first
of
the
lagoon
forts
which
they
were
approaching
a
dim
shape
moved
along
the
top
of
the
wall
and
seemed
to
linger
and
scrutinize
them
as
they
drew
nearer
the
challenge
da
rang
out
the
gondoliers
eagerly
answered
with
the
one
word
of
german
known
to
their
craft
and
struggled
to
urge
the
boat
forward
the
oar
of
the
gondolier
in
front
slipped
from
the
high
rowlock
and
fell
out
of
his
hand
into
the
water
the
gondola
lurched
and
then
suddenly
ran
aground
on
the
shallow
the
sentry
halted
dropped
his
gun
from
his
shoulder
and
ordered
them
to
go
on
while
the
gondoliers
clamored
back
in
the
high
key
of
fear
and
one
of
them
screamed
out
to
his
passengers
to
do
something
saying
that
a
few
weeks
before
a
sentinel
had
fired
upon
a
fisherman
and
killed
him
what
s
that
he
s
talking
about
demanded
vervain
if
we
don
t
get
on
it
will
be
that
man
s
duty
to
fire
on
us
he
has
no
choice
she
said
nerved
and
interested
by
the
presence
of
this
danger
the
gondoliers
leaped
into
the
water
and
tried
to
push
the
boat
off
it
would
not
move
and
without
warning
don
ippolito
who
had
sat
silent
since
they
left
fusina
stepped
over
the
side
of
the
gondola
and
thrusting
an
oar
under
its
bottom
lifted
it
free
of
the
shallow
oh
how
very
unnecessary
cried
vervain
as
the
priest
and
the
gondoliers
clambered
back
into
the
boat
he
will
take
his
death
of
it
s
ridiculous
said
ferris
you
ought
to
have
told
these
worthless
rascals
what
to
do
don
ippolito
you
ve
got
yourself
wet
for
nothing
it
s
too
bad
it
s
nothing
said
don
ippolito
taking
his
seat
on
the
little
prow
deck
and
quietly
dripping
where
the
water
would
not
incommode
the
others
oh
here
cried
vervain
gathering
some
shawls
together
make
him
wrap
those
about
him
he
ll
die
i
know
he
will
with
that
reeking
skirt
of
his
if
you
must
go
into
the
water
i
wish
you
had
worn
your
abbate
s
dress
how
you
don
ippolito
the
gondoliers
set
their
oars
but
before
they
had
given
a
stroke
they
were
arrested
by
a
sharp
halt
from
the
fort
another
figure
had
joined
the
sentry
and
stood
looking
at
them
well
said
ferris
what
i
wonder
that
s
an
officer
if
i
had
a
little
german
about
me
i
might
state
the
situation
to
he
felt
a
light
touch
on
his
arm
i
can
speak
german
said
florida
timidly
then
you
had
better
speak
it
now
said
ferris
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
in
a
steady
voice
briefly
explained
the
whole
affair
the
figures
listened
motionless
then
the
last
comer
politely
replied
begging
her
to
be
in
no
uneasiness
made
her
a
shadowy
salute
and
vanished
the
sentry
resumed
his
walk
and
took
no
further
notice
of
them
brava
said
ferris
while
vervain
babbled
her
satisfaction
i
will
buy
a
german
ollendorff
the
language
is
indispensable
to
a
pleasure
excursion
in
the
florida
made
no
reply
but
devoted
herself
to
restoring
her
mother
to
that
state
of
defense
against
the
discomforts
of
the
time
and
place
which
the
common
agitation
had
impaired
she
seemed
to
have
no
sense
of
the
presence
of
any
one
else
don
ippolito
did
not
speak
again
save
to
protect
himself
from
the
anxieties
and
reproaches
of
vervain
renewed
and
reiterated
at
intervals
she
drowsed
after
a
while
and
whenever
she
woke
she
thought
they
had
just
touched
her
own
landing
by
fits
it
was
cloudy
and
moonlight
they
began
to
meet
peasants
boats
going
to
the
rialto
market
at
last
they
entered
the
canal
of
the
zattere
then
they
slipped
into
a
narrow
way
and
presently
stopped
at
vervain
s
gate
this
time
she
had
not
expected
it
don
ippolito
gave
her
his
hand
and
entered
the
garden
with
her
while
ferris
lingered
behind
with
florida
helping
her
put
together
the
wraps
strewn
about
the
gondola
wait
she
commanded
as
they
moved
up
the
garden
walk
i
want
to
speak
with
you
about
don
ippolito
what
shall
i
do
to
him
for
my
rudeness
you
tell
me
you
she
said
in
a
fierce
whisper
gripping
the
arm
which
ferris
had
given
to
help
her
up
the
you
are
older
than
i
am
thanks
i
was
afraid
you
were
going
to
say
wiser
i
should
think
your
own
sense
of
justice
your
own
sense
of
decency
say
it
say
it
cried
the
girl
passionately
it
was
indecent
indecent
that
was
it
would
tell
you
what
to
do
concluded
the
painter
dryly
she
flung
away
the
arm
to
which
she
had
been
clinging
and
ran
to
where
the
priest
stood
with
her
mother
at
the
foot
of
the
terrace
stairs
don
ippolito
she
cried
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
am
sorry
i
want
to
ask
your
pardon
how
can
you
ever
forgive
me
for
what
i
she
instinctively
stretched
her
hand
towards
him
oh
said
the
priest
with
an
indescribable
long
trembling
sigh
he
caught
her
hand
in
his
held
it
tight
and
then
pressed
it
for
an
instant
against
his
breast
ferris
made
a
little
start
forward
now
that
s
right
florida
said
her
mother
as
the
four
stood
in
the
pale
estranging
moonlight
i
m
sure
don
ippolito
can
t
cherish
any
resentment
if
he
does
he
must
come
in
and
wash
it
out
with
a
glass
of
wine
that
s
a
good
old
fashion
i
want
you
to
have
the
wine
at
any
rate
don
ippolito
it
ll
keep
you
from
taking
cold
you
really
thanks
madama
i
can
not
lose
more
time
now
i
must
go
home
at
once
good
before
vervain
could
frame
a
protest
or
lay
hold
of
him
he
bowed
and
hurried
out
of
the
how
perfectly
absurd
for
him
to
get
into
the
water
in
that
way
she
said
looking
mechanically
in
the
direction
in
which
he
had
vanished
well
vervain
it
isn
t
best
to
be
too
grateful
to
people
said
ferris
but
i
think
we
must
allow
that
if
we
were
in
any
danger
sticking
there
in
the
mud
don
ippolito
got
us
out
of
it
by
putting
his
shoulder
to
the
of
course
assented
vervain
in
fact
continued
ferris
i
suppose
we
may
say
that
under
providence
we
probably
owe
our
lives
to
don
ippolito
s
and
miss
vervain
s
knowledge
of
german
at
any
rate
it
s
what
i
shall
always
mother
don
t
you
think
you
had
better
go
in
asked
florida
gently
her
gentleness
ignored
the
presence
the
existence
of
ferris
i
m
afraid
you
will
be
sick
after
all
this
there
vervain
it
ll
be
no
use
offering
a
glass
of
wine
i
m
sent
away
you
see
said
ferris
and
miss
vervain
is
quite
right
good
oh
night
ferris
said
vervain
giving
her
hand
thank
you
so
florida
did
not
look
towards
him
she
gathered
her
mother
s
shawl
about
her
shoulders
for
the
twentieth
time
that
day
and
softly
urged
her
in
doors
while
ferris
let
himself
out
into
the
campo
ix
florida
began
to
prepare
the
bed
for
her
mother
s
lying
down
what
are
you
doing
that
for
my
dear
asked
vervain
i
can
t
go
to
bed
at
but
mother
no
florida
and
i
mean
it
you
are
too
headstrong
i
should
think
you
would
see
yourself
how
you
suffer
in
the
end
by
giving
way
to
your
violent
temper
what
a
day
you
have
made
for
us
i
was
very
wrong
murmured
the
proud
girl
meekly
and
then
the
mortification
of
an
apology
you
might
have
spared
yourself
it
didn
t
mortify
me
i
didn
t
care
for
no
i
really
believe
you
are
too
haughty
to
mind
humbling
yourself
and
don
ippolito
had
been
so
uniformly
kind
to
us
i
begin
to
believe
that
ferris
caught
your
true
character
in
that
sketch
but
your
pride
will
be
broken
some
day
won
t
you
let
me
help
you
undress
mother
you
can
talk
to
me
while
you
re
undressing
you
must
try
to
get
some
yes
i
am
all
unstrung
why
couldn
t
you
have
let
him
come
in
and
talk
awhile
it
would
have
been
the
best
way
to
get
me
quieted
down
but
no
you
must
always
have
your
own
way
don
t
twitch
me
my
dear
i
d
rather
undress
myself
you
pretend
to
be
very
careful
of
me
i
wonder
if
you
really
care
for
oh
mother
you
are
all
i
have
in
the
world
vervain
began
to
whimper
you
talk
as
if
i
were
any
better
off
have
i
anybody
besides
you
and
i
have
lost
so
don
t
think
of
those
things
now
vervain
tenderly
kissed
the
young
girl
you
are
good
to
your
mother
don
ippolito
was
right
no
one
ever
saw
you
offer
me
disrespect
or
unkindness
there
there
don
t
cry
my
darling
i
think
i
better
lie
down
and
i
ll
let
you
undress
she
suffered
herself
to
be
helped
into
bed
and
florida
went
softly
about
the
room
putting
it
in
order
and
drawing
the
curtains
closer
to
keep
out
the
near
dawn
her
mother
talked
a
little
while
and
presently
fell
from
incoherence
to
silence
and
so
to
sleep
florida
looked
hesitatingly
at
her
for
a
moment
and
then
set
her
candle
on
the
floor
and
sank
wearily
into
an
beside
the
bed
her
hands
fell
into
her
lap
her
head
drooped
sadly
forward
the
light
flung
the
shadow
of
her
face
grotesquely
exaggerated
and
foreshortened
upon
the
ceiling
by
and
by
a
bird
piped
in
the
garden
the
shriek
of
a
swallow
made
itself
heard
from
a
distance
the
vernal
day
was
beginning
to
stir
from
the
light
brief
drowse
of
the
vernal
night
a
crown
of
angry
red
formed
upon
the
candle
wick
which
toppled
over
in
the
socket
and
guttered
out
with
a
sharp
hiss
florida
started
from
her
chair
a
streak
of
sunshine
pierced
shutter
and
curtain
her
mother
was
supporting
herself
on
one
elbow
in
the
bed
and
looking
at
her
as
if
she
had
just
called
to
her
mother
did
you
speak
asked
the
girl
vervain
turned
her
face
away
she
sighed
deeply
stretched
her
thin
hands
on
the
pillow
and
seemed
to
be
sinking
sinking
down
through
the
bed
she
ceased
to
breathe
and
lay
in
a
dead
faint
florida
felt
rather
than
saw
it
all
she
did
not
cry
out
nor
call
for
help
she
brought
water
and
cologne
and
bathed
her
mother
s
face
and
then
chafed
her
hands
vervain
slowly
revived
she
opened
her
eyes
then
closed
them
she
did
not
speak
but
after
a
while
she
began
to
fetch
her
breath
with
the
long
and
even
respirations
of
sleep
florida
noiselessly
opened
the
door
and
met
the
servant
with
a
tray
of
coffee
she
put
her
finger
to
her
lip
and
motioned
her
not
to
enter
asking
in
a
whisper
what
time
is
it
nina
i
forgot
to
wind
my
it
s
nine
o
clock
signorina
and
i
thought
you
would
be
tired
this
morning
and
would
like
your
coffee
in
bed
oh
misericordia
cried
the
girl
still
in
whisper
with
a
glance
through
the
doorway
you
haven
t
been
in
bed
at
all
my
mother
doesn
t
seem
well
i
sat
down
beside
her
and
fell
asleep
in
my
chair
without
knowing
ah
poor
little
thing
then
you
must
drink
your
coffee
at
once
it
yes
yes
said
florida
closing
the
door
and
pointing
to
a
table
in
the
next
room
put
it
down
here
i
will
serve
myself
nina
go
call
the
gondola
please
i
am
going
out
at
once
and
i
want
you
to
go
with
me
tell
checa
to
come
here
and
stay
with
my
mother
till
i
come
she
poured
out
a
cup
of
coffee
with
a
trembling
hand
and
hastily
drank
it
then
bathing
her
eyes
she
went
to
the
glass
and
bestowed
a
touch
or
two
upon
yesterday
s
toilet
studied
the
effect
a
moment
and
turned
away
she
ran
back
for
another
look
and
the
next
moment
she
was
walking
down
to
the
where
she
found
nina
waiting
her
in
the
gondola
a
rapid
course
brought
them
to
ferris
s
landing
ring
she
said
to
the
gondolier
and
say
that
one
of
the
american
ladies
wishes
to
see
the
ferris
was
standing
on
the
balcony
over
her
where
he
had
been
watching
her
approach
in
mute
wonder
why
miss
vervain
he
called
down
what
in
the
world
is
the
matter
i
don
t
know
i
want
to
see
you
said
florida
looking
up
with
a
wistful
face
i
ll
come
yes
please
or
no
i
had
better
come
up
yes
nina
and
i
will
come
ferris
met
them
at
the
lower
door
and
led
them
to
his
apartment
nina
sat
down
in
the
outer
room
and
florida
followed
the
painter
into
his
studio
though
her
face
was
so
wan
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
never
seen
it
lovelier
and
he
had
a
strange
pride
in
her
being
there
though
the
disorder
of
the
place
ought
to
have
humbled
him
she
looked
over
it
with
a
certain
childlike
timid
curiosity
and
something
of
that
lofty
compassion
with
which
young
ladies
regard
the
haunts
of
men
when
they
come
into
them
by
chance
in
doing
this
she
had
a
haughty
slow
turn
of
the
head
that
fascinated
him
i
hope
he
said
you
don
t
mind
the
smell
which
was
a
mingled
one
of
and
the
woman
s
putting
my
office
to
rights
and
it
s
all
in
a
cloud
of
dust
so
i
have
to
bring
you
in
florida
sat
down
on
a
chair
fronting
the
easel
and
found
herself
looking
into
the
sad
eyes
of
don
ippolito
ferris
brusquely
turned
the
back
of
the
canvas
toward
her
i
didn
t
mean
you
to
see
that
it
isn
t
ready
to
show
yet
he
said
and
then
he
stood
expectantly
before
her
he
waited
for
her
to
speak
for
he
never
knew
how
to
take
miss
vervain
he
was
willing
enough
to
make
light
of
her
grand
moods
but
now
she
was
too
evidently
unhappy
for
mocking
at
the
same
time
he
did
not
care
to
invoke
a
snub
by
a
prematurely
sympathetic
demeanor
his
mind
ran
on
the
events
of
the
day
before
and
he
thought
this
visit
probably
related
somehow
to
don
ippolito
but
his
visitor
did
not
speak
and
at
last
he
said
i
hope
there
s
nothing
wrong
at
home
miss
vervain
it
s
rather
odd
to
have
yesterday
last
night
and
next
morning
all
run
together
as
they
have
been
for
me
in
the
last
hours
i
trust
vervain
is
turning
the
whole
thing
into
a
good
solid
it
s
about
it
s
about
i
came
to
see
you
said
florida
hoarsely
i
mean
she
hurried
on
to
say
that
i
want
to
ask
you
who
is
the
best
doctor
here
then
it
was
not
about
don
ippolito
is
your
mother
sick
asked
ferris
eagerly
she
must
have
been
fearfully
tired
by
that
unlucky
expedition
of
ours
i
hope
there
s
nothing
serious
no
no
but
she
is
not
well
she
is
very
frail
you
know
you
must
have
noticed
how
frail
she
is
said
florida
tremulously
ferris
had
noticed
that
all
his
countrywomen
past
their
girlhood
seemed
to
be
sick
he
did
not
know
how
or
why
he
supposed
it
was
all
right
it
was
so
common
in
vervain
s
case
though
she
talked
a
great
deal
about
her
he
had
noticed
it
rather
less
than
usual
she
had
so
great
spirit
he
recalled
now
that
he
thought
her
at
times
rather
a
shadowy
presence
and
that
occasionally
it
had
amused
him
that
so
slight
a
structure
should
hang
together
as
it
did
not
only
successfully
but
triumphantly
he
said
yes
he
knew
that
vervain
was
not
strong
and
florida
continued
it
s
only
advice
that
i
want
for
her
but
i
think
we
had
better
see
some
one
or
know
some
one
that
we
could
go
to
in
need
we
are
so
far
from
any
one
we
know
or
help
of
any
she
seemed
to
be
trying
to
account
to
herself
rather
than
to
ferris
for
what
she
was
doing
we
mustn
t
let
anything
pass
unnoticed
she
looked
at
him
entreatingly
but
a
shadow
as
of
some
wounding
memory
passed
over
her
face
and
she
said
no
more
i
ll
go
with
you
to
a
doctor
s
said
ferris
kindly
no
please
i
won
t
trouble
it
s
no
i
don
t
you
to
go
with
me
please
i
d
rather
go
ferris
looked
at
her
perplexedly
as
she
rose
just
give
me
the
address
and
i
shall
manage
best
by
myself
i
m
used
to
doing
as
you
like
wait
a
ferris
wrote
the
address
there
he
said
giving
it
to
her
but
isn
t
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
yes
answered
florida
with
awkward
hesitation
and
a
look
at
him
you
must
have
all
sorts
of
people
applying
to
you
as
a
consul
and
you
look
after
their
affairs
and
try
to
forget
them
well
said
ferris
i
wish
you
wouldn
t
remember
that
i
ve
asked
this
favor
of
you
that
you
d
consider
it
a
consular
service
with
all
my
heart
answered
ferris
thinking
for
the
third
or
fourth
time
how
very
young
miss
vervain
was
you
are
very
good
you
are
kinder
than
i
have
any
right
said
florida
smiling
piteously
i
only
mean
don
t
speak
of
it
to
my
mother
not
she
added
but
what
i
want
her
to
know
everything
i
do
but
it
would
worry
her
if
she
thought
i
was
anxious
about
her
oh
i
wish
i
wouldn
she
began
a
hasty
search
for
her
handkerchief
he
saw
her
lips
tremble
and
his
soul
trembled
with
them
in
another
moment
she
said
briskly
with
a
sort
of
airy
sob
i
don
t
want
you
to
come
down
she
drifted
out
of
the
room
and
down
the
stairs
the
falling
into
her
wake
ferris
filled
his
pipe
and
went
out
on
his
balcony
again
and
stood
watching
the
gondola
in
its
course
toward
the
address
he
had
given
and
smoking
thoughtfully
it
was
really
the
same
girl
who
had
given
poor
don
ippolito
that
cruel
slap
in
the
face
yesterday
but
that
seemed
no
more
out
of
reason
than
her
sudden
generous
exaggerated
remorse
both
were
of
a
piece
with
her
coming
to
him
for
help
now
holding
him
at
a
distance
flinging
herself
upon
his
sympathy
and
then
trying
to
snub
him
and
breaking
down
in
the
effort
it
was
all
of
a
piece
and
the
piece
was
bad
yes
she
had
an
ugly
temper
and
yet
she
had
magnanimous
traits
too
these
contradictions
which
in
his
reverie
he
felt
rather
than
formulated
made
him
smile
as
he
stood
on
his
balcony
bathed
by
the
morning
air
and
sunlight
in
fresh
strong
ignorance
of
the
whole
mystery
of
women
s
nerves
these
caprices
even
charmed
him
he
reflected
that
he
had
gone
on
doing
the
vervains
one
favor
after
another
in
spite
of
florida
s
childish
petulancies
and
he
resolved
that
he
would
not
stop
now
her
whims
should
be
nothing
to
him
as
they
had
been
nothing
hitherto
it
is
flattering
to
a
man
to
be
indispensable
to
a
woman
so
long
as
he
is
not
obliged
to
it
miss
vervain
s
dependent
relation
to
himself
in
this
visit
gave
her
a
grace
in
ferris
s
eyes
which
she
had
wanted
before
in
the
mean
time
he
saw
her
gondola
stop
turn
round
and
come
back
to
the
canal
that
bordered
the
vervain
garden
another
change
of
mind
thought
ferris
complacently
and
rising
superior
to
the
whole
fitful
sex
he
released
himself
from
uneasiness
on
vervain
s
account
but
in
the
evening
he
went
to
ask
after
her
he
first
sent
his
card
to
florida
having
written
on
it
i
hope
vervain
is
better
don
t
let
me
come
in
if
it
s
any
he
looked
for
a
moment
at
what
he
had
written
dimly
conscious
that
it
was
patronizing
and
when
he
entered
he
saw
that
miss
vervain
stood
on
the
defensive
and
from
some
willfulness
meant
to
make
him
feel
that
he
was
presumptuous
in
coming
it
did
not
comfort
him
to
consider
that
she
was
very
young
mother
will
be
in
directly
said
florida
in
a
tone
that
relegated
their
morning
s
interview
to
the
age
of
fable
vervain
came
in
smiling
and
cordial
apparently
better
and
not
worse
for
yesterday
s
misadventures
oh
i
pick
up
quickly
she
explained
i
m
an
old
campaigner
you
know
perhaps
a
little
old
now
years
do
make
a
difference
and
you
ll
find
it
out
as
you
get
on
i
suppose
so
said
ferris
not
caring
to
have
vervain
treat
him
so
much
like
a
boy
even
at
i
found
it
pleasant
to
take
a
nap
this
afternoon
how
does
one
stand
it
at
seventeen
miss
vervain
he
asked
i
haven
t
felt
the
need
of
sleep
replied
florida
indifferently
and
he
felt
shelved
as
an
old
fellow
he
had
an
empty
frivolous
visit
to
his
thinking
vervain
asked
if
he
had
seen
don
ippolito
and
wondered
that
the
priest
had
not
come
about
all
day
she
told
a
long
story
and
at
the
end
tapped
herself
on
the
mouth
with
her
fan
to
punish
a
yawn
ferris
rose
to
go
vervain
wondered
again
in
the
same
words
why
don
ippolito
had
not
been
near
them
all
day
because
he
s
a
wise
man
said
ferris
with
bitterness
and
knows
when
to
time
his
vervain
did
not
notice
his
bitterness
but
something
made
florida
follow
him
to
the
outer
door
why
it
s
moonlight
she
exclaimed
and
she
glanced
at
him
as
though
she
had
some
purpose
of
atonement
in
her
mind
but
he
would
not
have
it
yes
there
s
a
moon
he
said
moodily
good
night
answered
florida
and
she
impulsively
offered
him
her
hand
he
thought
that
it
shook
in
his
but
it
was
probably
the
agitation
of
his
own
nerves
a
soreness
that
had
been
lifted
from
his
heart
came
back
he
walked
home
disappointed
and
defeated
he
hardly
knew
why
or
in
what
he
did
not
laugh
now
to
think
how
she
had
asked
him
that
morning
to
forget
her
coming
to
him
for
help
he
was
outraged
that
he
should
have
been
repaid
in
this
sort
and
the
rebuff
with
which
his
sympathy
had
just
been
met
was
vulgar
there
was
no
other
name
for
it
but
vulgarity
yet
he
could
not
relate
this
quality
to
the
face
of
the
young
girl
as
he
constantly
beheld
it
in
his
homeward
walk
it
did
not
defy
him
or
repulse
him
it
looked
up
at
him
wistfully
as
from
the
gondola
that
morning
nevertheless
he
hardened
his
heart
the
vervains
should
see
him
next
when
they
had
sent
for
him
after
all
one
is
not
so
very
old
at
x
don
ippolito
has
come
signorina
said
nina
the
next
morning
approaching
florida
where
she
sat
in
an
attitude
of
listless
patience
in
the
garden
don
ippolito
echoed
the
young
girl
in
a
weary
tone
she
rose
and
went
into
the
house
and
they
met
with
the
constraint
which
was
but
too
natural
after
the
events
of
their
last
parting
it
is
hard
to
tell
which
has
most
to
overcome
in
such
a
case
the
forgiver
or
the
forgiven
pardon
rankles
even
in
a
generous
soul
and
the
memory
of
having
pardoned
embarrasses
the
sensitive
spirit
before
the
object
of
its
clemency
humbling
and
making
it
ashamed
it
would
be
well
i
suppose
if
there
need
be
nothing
of
the
kind
between
human
creatures
who
can
not
sustain
such
a
relation
without
mutual
distrust
it
is
not
so
ill
with
them
when
apart
but
when
they
meet
they
must
be
cold
and
shy
at
first
now
i
see
what
you
two
are
thinking
about
said
vervain
and
a
faint
blush
tinged
the
cheek
of
the
priest
as
she
thus
paired
him
off
with
her
daughter
you
are
thinking
about
what
happened
the
other
day
and
you
had
better
forget
it
there
is
no
use
brooding
over
these
matters
dear
me
if
had
stopped
to
brood
over
every
little
unpleasant
thing
that
happened
i
wonder
where
i
should
be
now
by
the
way
where
were
all
day
yesterday
don
ippolito
i
did
not
come
to
disturb
you
because
i
thought
you
must
be
very
tired
besides
i
was
quite
oh
yes
those
inventions
of
yours
i
think
you
are
ingenious
but
you
mustn
t
apply
too
closely
now
really
yesterday
after
all
you
had
been
through
it
was
too
much
for
the
she
tapped
herself
on
the
forehead
with
her
fan
i
was
not
busy
with
my
inventions
madama
answered
don
ippolito
who
sat
in
the
womanish
attitude
priests
get
from
their
drapery
and
fingered
the
cord
round
his
hat
i
have
scarcely
touched
them
of
late
but
our
parish
takes
part
in
the
procession
of
corpus
domini
in
the
piazza
and
i
had
my
share
of
the
oh
to
be
sure
when
is
it
to
be
we
must
all
go
our
nina
has
been
telling
florida
of
the
grand
sights
little
children
dressed
up
like
john
the
baptist
leading
lambs
i
suppose
it
s
a
great
event
with
the
priest
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
opened
both
his
hands
so
that
his
hat
slid
to
the
floor
bumping
and
tumbling
some
distance
away
he
recovered
it
and
sat
down
again
it
s
an
observance
he
said
coldly
and
shall
you
be
in
the
procession
i
shall
be
there
with
the
other
priests
of
my
delightful
cried
vervain
we
shall
be
looking
out
for
you
i
shall
feel
greatly
honored
to
think
i
actually
know
some
one
in
the
procession
i
m
going
to
give
you
a
little
nod
you
won
t
think
it
very
wrong
she
saved
him
from
the
embarrassment
he
might
have
felt
in
replying
by
an
abrupt
lapse
from
all
apparent
interest
in
the
subject
she
turned
to
her
daughter
and
said
with
a
querulous
accent
i
wish
you
would
throw
the
afghan
over
my
feet
florida
and
make
me
a
little
comfortable
before
you
begin
your
reading
this
at
the
same
time
she
feebly
disposed
herself
among
the
sofa
cushions
on
which
she
reclined
and
waited
for
some
final
touches
from
her
daughter
then
she
said
i
m
just
going
to
close
my
eyes
but
i
shall
hear
every
word
you
are
getting
a
beautiful
accent
my
dear
i
know
you
are
i
should
think
goldoni
must
have
a
very
smooth
agreeable
style
hasn
t
he
now
in
italian
they
began
to
read
the
comedy
after
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
vervain
opened
her
eyes
and
said
but
before
you
commence
florida
i
wish
you
d
play
a
little
to
get
me
quieted
down
i
feel
so
very
flighty
i
suppose
it
s
this
sirocco
and
i
believe
i
ll
lie
down
in
the
next
florida
followed
her
to
repeat
the
arrangements
for
her
comfort
then
she
returned
and
sitting
down
at
the
piano
struck
with
a
sort
of
soft
firmness
a
few
low
soothing
chords
out
of
which
a
lulling
melody
grew
with
her
fingers
still
resting
on
the
keys
she
turned
her
stately
head
and
glanced
through
the
open
door
at
her
mother
don
ippolito
she
asked
softly
is
there
anything
in
the
air
of
venice
that
makes
people
very
drowsy
i
have
never
heard
that
i
wonder
continued
the
young
girl
absently
why
my
mother
wants
to
sleep
so
perhaps
she
has
not
recovered
from
the
fatigues
of
the
other
night
suggested
the
priest
perhaps
said
florida
sadly
looking
toward
her
mother
s
door
she
turned
again
to
the
instrument
and
let
her
fingers
wander
over
the
keys
with
a
drooping
head
presently
she
lifted
her
face
and
smoothed
back
from
her
temples
some
straggling
tendrils
of
hair
without
looking
at
the
priest
she
asked
with
the
bluntness
that
characterized
her
why
don
t
you
like
to
walk
in
the
procession
of
corpus
domini
don
ippolito
s
color
came
and
went
and
he
answered
evasively
i
have
not
said
that
i
did
not
like
to
do
no
that
is
true
said
florida
letting
her
fingers
drop
again
on
the
keys
don
ippolito
rose
from
the
sofa
where
he
had
been
sitting
beside
her
while
they
read
and
walked
the
length
of
the
room
then
he
came
towards
her
and
said
meekly
madamigella
i
did
not
mean
to
repel
any
interest
you
feel
in
me
but
it
was
a
strange
question
to
ask
a
priest
as
i
remembered
i
was
when
you
asked
don
t
you
always
remember
that
demanded
the
girl
still
without
turning
her
head
no
sometimes
i
am
suffered
to
forget
it
he
said
with
a
tentative
accent
she
did
not
respond
and
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
walked
away
in
silence
she
let
her
hands
fall
into
her
lap
and
sat
in
an
attitude
of
expectation
as
don
ippolito
came
near
her
again
he
paused
a
second
time
it
is
in
this
house
that
i
forget
my
priesthood
he
began
and
it
is
the
first
of
your
kindnesses
that
you
suffer
me
to
do
so
your
good
mother
there
and
you
how
shall
i
repay
you
it
cut
me
to
the
heart
that
you
should
ask
forgiveness
of
me
when
you
did
though
i
was
hurt
by
your
rebuke
oh
had
you
not
the
right
to
rebuke
me
if
i
abused
the
delicate
unreserve
with
which
you
had
always
treated
me
but
believe
me
i
meant
no
wrong
his
voice
shook
and
florida
broke
in
you
did
nothing
wrong
it
was
i
who
was
cruel
for
no
no
no
you
shall
not
say
that
he
returned
and
why
should
i
have
cared
for
a
few
words
when
all
your
acts
had
expressed
a
trust
of
me
that
is
like
heaven
to
my
soul
she
turned
now
and
looked
at
him
and
he
went
on
ah
i
see
you
do
not
understand
how
could
you
know
what
it
is
to
be
a
priest
in
this
most
unhappy
city
to
be
haunted
by
the
strict
espionage
of
all
your
own
class
to
be
shunned
as
a
spy
by
all
who
are
not
of
it
but
you
two
have
not
put
up
that
barrier
which
everywhere
shuts
me
out
from
my
kind
you
have
been
willing
to
see
the
man
in
me
and
to
let
me
forget
the
i
do
not
know
what
to
say
to
you
don
ippolito
i
am
only
a
foreigner
a
girl
and
i
am
very
ignorant
of
these
things
said
florida
with
a
slight
alarm
i
am
afraid
that
you
may
be
saying
what
you
will
be
sorry
oh
never
do
not
fear
for
me
if
i
am
frank
with
you
it
is
my
refuge
from
the
passionate
vibration
of
his
voice
increased
as
if
it
must
break
in
tears
she
glanced
towards
the
other
room
with
a
little
movement
or
stir
ah
you
needn
t
be
afraid
of
listening
to
me
cried
the
priest
bitterly
i
will
not
wake
her
said
florida
calmly
after
an
instant
see
how
you
speak
the
thing
you
mean
always
always
always
you
could
not
deny
that
you
meant
to
wake
her
for
you
have
the
habit
of
the
truth
do
you
know
what
it
is
to
have
the
habit
of
a
lie
it
is
to
be
a
priest
do
you
know
what
it
is
to
seem
to
say
to
do
the
thing
you
are
not
think
not
will
not
to
leave
what
you
believe
unspoken
what
you
will
undone
what
you
are
unknown
it
is
to
be
a
priest
don
ippolito
spoke
in
italian
and
he
uttered
these
words
in
a
voice
carefully
guarded
from
every
listener
but
the
one
before
his
face
do
you
know
what
it
is
when
such
a
moment
as
this
comes
and
you
would
fling
away
the
whole
fabric
of
falsehood
that
has
clothed
your
life
do
you
know
what
it
is
to
keep
still
so
much
of
it
as
will
help
you
to
unmask
silently
and
secretly
it
is
to
be
a
priest
his
voice
had
lost
its
vehemence
and
his
manner
was
strangely
subdued
and
cold
the
sort
of
gentle
apathy
it
expressed
together
with
a
certain
sad
impersonal
surprise
at
the
difference
between
his
own
and
the
happier
fortune
with
which
he
contrasted
it
was
more
touching
than
any
tragic
demonstration
as
if
she
felt
the
fascination
of
the
pathos
which
she
could
not
fully
analyze
the
young
girl
sat
silent
after
a
time
in
which
she
seemed
to
be
trying
to
think
it
all
out
she
asked
in
a
low
deep
murmur
why
did
you
become
a
priest
then
it
is
a
long
story
said
don
ippolito
i
will
not
trouble
you
with
it
now
some
other
no
now
answered
florida
in
english
if
you
hate
so
to
be
a
priest
i
can
t
understand
why
you
should
have
allowed
yourself
to
become
one
we
should
be
very
unhappy
if
we
could
not
respect
you
not
trust
you
as
we
have
done
and
how
could
we
if
we
knew
you
were
not
true
to
yourself
in
being
what
you
are
madamigella
said
the
priest
i
never
dared
believe
that
i
was
in
the
smallest
thing
necessary
to
your
happiness
is
it
true
then
that
you
care
for
my
being
rather
this
than
that
that
you
are
in
the
least
grieved
by
any
wrong
of
mine
i
scarcely
know
what
you
mean
how
could
we
help
being
grieved
by
what
you
have
said
to
me
thanks
but
why
do
you
care
whether
a
priest
of
my
church
loves
his
calling
or
not
you
a
protestant
it
is
that
you
are
sorry
for
me
as
an
unhappy
man
is
it
not
yes
it
is
that
and
more
i
am
no
catholic
but
we
are
both
christians
don
ippolito
gave
the
faintest
movement
of
his
shoulders
and
i
can
not
endure
to
think
of
your
doing
the
things
you
must
do
as
a
priest
and
yet
hating
to
be
a
priest
it
is
terrible
are
all
the
priests
of
your
faith
devotees
they
can
not
be
but
are
none
of
yours
so
oh
god
forbid
that
i
should
say
that
i
have
known
real
saints
among
them
that
friend
of
mine
in
padua
of
whom
i
once
told
you
became
such
and
died
an
angel
fit
for
paradise
and
i
suppose
that
my
poor
uncle
is
a
saint
too
in
his
your
uncle
a
priest
you
have
never
mentioned
him
to
no
said
don
ippolito
after
a
certain
pause
he
began
abruptly
we
are
of
the
people
my
family
and
in
each
generation
we
have
sought
to
honor
our
blood
by
devoting
one
of
the
race
to
the
church
when
i
was
a
child
i
used
to
divert
myself
by
making
little
figures
out
of
wood
and
pasteboard
and
i
drew
rude
copies
of
the
pictures
i
saw
at
church
we
lived
in
the
house
where
i
live
now
and
where
i
was
born
and
my
mother
let
me
play
in
the
small
chamber
where
i
now
have
my
forge
it
was
anciently
the
oratory
of
the
noble
family
that
occupied
the
whole
palace
i
contrived
an
altar
at
one
end
of
it
i
stuck
my
pictures
about
the
walls
and
i
ranged
the
puppets
in
the
order
of
worshippers
on
the
floor
then
i
played
at
saying
mass
and
preached
to
them
all
day
long
my
mother
was
a
widow
she
used
to
watch
me
with
tears
in
her
eyes
at
last
one
day
she
brought
my
uncle
to
see
me
i
remember
it
all
far
better
than
yesterday
is
it
not
the
will
of
god
she
asked
my
uncle
called
me
to
him
and
asked
me
whether
i
should
like
to
be
a
priest
in
good
earnest
when
i
grew
up
shall
i
then
be
able
to
make
as
many
little
figures
as
i
like
and
to
paint
pictures
and
carve
an
altar
like
that
in
your
church
i
demanded
my
uncle
answered
that
i
should
have
real
men
and
women
to
preach
to
as
he
had
and
would
not
that
be
much
finer
in
my
heart
i
did
not
think
so
for
i
did
not
care
for
that
part
of
it
i
only
liked
to
preach
to
my
puppets
because
i
had
made
them
but
said
oh
yes
as
children
do
i
kept
on
contriving
the
toys
that
i
played
with
and
i
grew
used
to
hearing
it
told
among
my
mates
and
about
the
neighborhood
that
i
was
to
be
a
priest
i
can
not
remember
any
other
talk
with
my
mother
and
i
do
not
know
how
or
when
it
was
decided
whenever
i
thought
of
the
matter
i
thought
that
will
be
very
well
the
priests
have
very
little
to
do
and
they
gain
a
great
deal
of
money
with
their
masses
and
i
shall
be
able
to
make
whatever
i
i
only
considered
the
office
then
as
a
means
to
gratify
the
passion
that
has
always
filled
my
soul
for
inventions
and
works
of
mechanical
skill
and
ingenuity
my
inclination
was
purely
secular
but
i
was
as
inevitably
becoming
a
priest
as
if
i
had
been
born
to
be
but
you
were
not
forced
there
was
no
pressure
upon
you
no
there
was
merely
an
absence
so
far
as
they
were
concerned
of
any
other
idea
i
think
they
meant
justly
and
assuredly
they
meant
kindly
by
me
i
grew
in
years
and
the
time
came
when
i
was
to
begin
my
studies
it
was
my
uncle
s
influence
that
placed
me
in
the
seminary
of
the
salute
and
there
i
repaid
his
care
by
the
utmost
diligence
but
it
was
not
the
theological
studies
that
i
loved
it
was
the
mathematics
and
their
practical
application
and
among
the
classics
i
loved
best
the
poets
and
the
historians
yes
i
can
see
that
i
was
always
a
mundane
spirit
and
some
of
those
in
charge
of
me
at
once
divined
it
i
think
they
used
to
take
us
to
walk
you
have
seen
the
little
creatures
in
their
priest
s
gowns
which
they
put
on
when
they
enter
the
school
with
a
couple
of
young
priests
at
the
head
of
the
file
and
once
for
an
uncommon
pleasure
they
took
us
to
the
arsenal
and
let
us
see
the
shipyards
and
the
museum
you
know
the
wonderful
things
that
are
there
the
flags
and
the
guns
captured
from
the
turks
the
strange
weapons
of
all
devices
the
famous
suits
of
armor
i
came
back
i
wept
that
i
must
leave
the
place
but
i
set
to
work
the
best
i
could
to
carve
out
in
wood
an
invention
which
the
model
of
one
of
the
antique
galleys
had
suggested
to
me
they
found
it
nothing
can
be
concealed
outside
of
your
own
breast
in
such
a
school
and
they
carried
me
with
my
contrivance
before
the
superior
he
looked
kindly
but
gravely
at
me
my
son
said
he
do
you
wish
to
be
a
priest
surely
reverend
father
i
answered
in
alarm
why
not
because
these
things
are
not
for
priests
their
thoughts
must
be
upon
other
things
consider
well
of
it
my
son
while
there
is
yet
time
he
said
and
he
addressed
me
a
long
and
serious
discourse
upon
the
life
on
which
i
was
to
enter
he
was
a
just
and
conscientious
and
affectionate
man
but
every
word
fell
like
burning
fire
in
my
heart
at
the
end
he
took
my
poor
plaything
and
thrust
it
down
among
the
coals
of
his
it
made
the
scaldino
smoke
and
he
bade
me
carry
it
out
with
me
and
so
turned
again
to
his
book
my
mother
was
by
this
time
dead
but
i
could
hardly
have
gone
to
her
if
she
had
still
been
living
these
things
are
not
for
priests
kept
repeating
itself
night
and
day
in
my
brain
i
was
in
despair
i
was
in
a
fury
to
see
my
uncle
i
poured
out
my
heart
to
him
and
tried
to
make
him
understand
the
illusions
and
vain
hopes
in
which
i
had
lived
he
received
coldly
my
sorrow
and
the
reproaches
which
i
did
not
spare
him
he
bade
me
consider
my
inclinations
as
so
many
temptations
to
be
overcome
for
the
good
of
my
soul
and
the
glory
of
god
he
warned
me
against
the
scandal
of
attempting
to
withdraw
now
from
the
path
marked
out
for
me
i
said
that
i
never
would
be
a
priest
and
what
will
you
do
he
asked
alas
what
could
i
do
i
went
back
to
my
prison
and
in
due
course
i
became
a
priest
it
was
not
without
sufficient
warning
that
i
took
one
order
after
another
but
my
uncle
s
words
what
will
you
do
made
me
deaf
to
these
admonitions
all
that
is
now
past
i
no
longer
resent
nor
hate
i
seem
to
have
lost
the
power
but
those
were
days
when
my
soul
was
filled
with
bitterness
something
of
this
must
have
showed
itself
to
those
who
had
me
in
their
charge
i
have
heard
that
at
one
time
my
superiors
had
grave
doubts
whether
i
ought
to
be
allowed
to
take
orders
my
examination
in
which
the
difficulties
of
the
sacerdotal
life
were
brought
before
me
with
the
greatest
clearness
was
severe
i
do
not
know
how
i
passed
it
it
must
have
been
in
grace
to
my
uncle
i
spent
the
next
ten
days
in
a
convent
to
meditate
upon
the
step
i
was
about
to
take
poor
helpless
friendless
wretch
madamigella
even
yet
i
can
not
see
how
i
was
to
blame
that
i
came
forth
and
received
the
first
of
the
holy
orders
and
in
their
time
the
second
and
the
third
i
was
a
priest
but
no
more
a
priest
at
heart
than
those
venetian
conscripts
whom
you
saw
carried
away
last
week
are
austrian
soldiers
i
was
bound
as
they
are
bound
by
an
inexorable
and
inevitable
law
you
have
asked
me
why
i
became
a
priest
perhaps
i
have
not
told
you
why
but
i
have
told
you
how
i
have
given
you
the
slight
outward
events
not
the
processes
of
my
mind
and
that
is
all
that
i
can
do
if
the
guilt
was
mine
i
have
suffered
for
it
if
it
was
not
mine
still
i
have
suffered
for
it
some
ban
seems
to
have
rested
upon
whatever
i
have
attempted
my
work
oh
i
know
it
well
enough
has
all
been
cursed
with
futility
my
labors
are
miserable
failures
or
contemptible
successes
i
have
had
my
unselfish
dreams
of
blessing
mankind
by
some
great
discovery
or
invention
but
my
life
has
been
barren
barren
barren
and
save
for
the
kindness
that
i
have
known
in
this
house
and
that
would
not
let
me
despair
it
would
now
be
without
he
ceased
and
the
girl
who
had
listened
with
her
proud
looks
transfigured
to
an
aspect
of
grieving
pity
fetched
a
long
sigh
oh
i
am
sorry
for
you
she
said
more
sorry
than
i
know
how
to
tell
but
you
must
not
lose
courage
you
must
not
give
up
don
ippolito
resumed
with
a
melancholy
smile
there
are
doubtless
temptations
enough
to
be
false
under
the
best
of
conditions
in
this
world
but
something
i
do
not
know
what
or
whom
perhaps
no
more
my
uncle
or
my
mother
than
i
for
they
were
only
as
the
past
had
made
them
caused
me
to
begin
by
living
a
lie
do
you
not
see
yes
yes
reluctantly
assented
the
girl
perhaps
who
knows
that
is
why
no
good
has
come
of
me
nor
can
come
my
uncle
s
piety
and
repute
have
always
been
my
efficient
help
he
is
the
principal
priest
of
the
church
to
which
i
am
attached
and
he
has
had
infinite
patience
with
me
my
ambition
and
my
attempted
inventions
are
a
scandal
to
him
for
he
is
a
priest
of
those
like
the
holy
father
who
believe
that
all
the
wickedness
of
the
modern
world
has
come
from
the
devices
of
science
my
indifference
to
the
things
of
religion
is
a
terror
and
a
sorrow
to
him
which
he
combats
with
prayers
and
penances
he
starves
himself
and
goes
cold
and
faint
that
god
may
have
mercy
and
turn
my
heart
to
the
things
on
which
his
own
is
fixed
he
loves
my
soul
but
not
me
and
we
are
scarcely
florida
continued
to
look
at
him
with
steadfast
compassionate
eyes
it
seems
very
strange
almost
like
some
dream
she
murmured
that
you
should
be
saying
all
this
to
me
don
ippolito
and
i
do
not
know
why
i
should
have
asked
you
the
pity
of
this
virginal
heart
must
have
been
very
sweet
to
the
man
on
whom
she
looked
it
his
eyes
worshipped
her
as
he
answered
her
devoutly
it
was
due
to
the
truth
in
you
that
i
should
seem
to
you
what
i
indeed
you
make
me
ashamed
she
cried
with
a
blush
it
was
selfish
of
me
to
ask
you
to
speak
and
now
after
what
you
have
told
me
i
am
so
helpless
and
i
know
so
very
little
that
i
don
t
understand
how
to
comfort
or
encourage
you
but
surely
you
can
somehow
help
yourself
are
men
that
seem
so
strong
and
able
just
as
powerless
as
women
after
all
when
it
comes
to
real
trouble
is
a
man
i
can
not
answer
i
am
only
a
priest
said
don
ippolito
coldly
letting
his
eyes
drop
to
the
gown
that
fell
about
him
like
a
woman
s
skirt
yes
but
a
priest
should
be
a
man
and
so
much
more
a
priest
don
ippolito
shrugged
his
shoulders
no
no
cried
the
girl
your
own
schemes
have
all
failed
you
say
then
why
do
you
not
think
of
becoming
a
priest
in
reality
and
getting
the
good
there
must
be
in
such
a
calling
it
is
singular
that
i
should
venture
to
say
such
a
thing
to
you
and
it
must
seem
presumptuous
and
ridiculous
for
me
a
protestant
but
our
ways
are
so
she
paused
coloring
deeply
then
controlled
herself
and
added
with
grave
composure
if
you
were
to
pray
to
what
madamigella
asked
the
priest
sadly
to
what
she
echoed
opening
her
eyes
full
upon
him
to
god
don
ippolito
made
no
answer
he
let
his
head
fall
so
low
upon
his
breast
that
she
could
see
the
sacerdotal
tonsure
you
must
excuse
me
she
said
blushing
again
i
did
not
mean
to
wound
your
feelings
as
a
catholic
i
have
been
very
bold
and
intrusive
i
ought
to
have
remembered
that
people
of
your
church
have
different
ideas
that
the
saints
don
ippolito
looked
up
with
pensive
irony
oh
the
poor
saints
i
don
t
understand
you
said
florida
very
gravely
i
mean
that
i
believe
in
the
saints
as
little
as
you
but
you
believe
in
your
church
i
have
no
there
was
a
silence
in
which
don
ippolito
again
dropped
his
head
upon
his
breast
florida
leaned
forward
in
her
eagerness
and
murmured
you
believe
in
god
the
priest
lifted
his
eyes
and
looked
at
her
beseechingly
i
do
not
know
he
whispered
she
met
his
gaze
with
one
of
dumb
bewilderment
at
last
she
said
sometimes
you
baptize
little
children
and
receive
them
into
the
church
in
the
name
of
god
poor
creatures
come
to
you
and
confess
their
sins
and
you
absolve
them
or
order
them
to
do
penances
and
sometimes
when
people
are
dying
you
must
stand
by
their
and
give
them
the
last
consolations
of
religion
it
is
oh
moaned
the
girl
and
fixed
on
don
ippolito
a
long
look
of
wonder
and
reproach
which
he
met
with
eyes
of
silent
anguish
it
is
terrible
madamigella
he
said
rising
i
know
it
i
would
fain
have
lived
for
i
think
i
was
made
so
but
now
you
see
how
black
and
deadly
a
lie
my
life
is
it
is
worse
than
you
could
have
imagined
is
it
not
it
is
worse
than
the
life
of
the
cruelest
bigot
for
he
at
least
believes
in
worse
far
worse
but
at
least
dear
young
lady
he
went
on
piteously
believe
me
that
i
have
the
grace
to
abhor
myself
it
is
not
much
it
is
very
very
little
but
it
is
something
do
not
wholly
condemn
me
condemn
oh
i
am
sorry
for
you
with
my
whole
heart
only
why
must
you
tell
me
all
this
no
no
you
are
not
to
blame
i
made
you
speak
i
made
you
put
yourself
to
not
that
dearest
madamigella
i
would
unsay
nothing
now
if
i
could
unless
to
take
away
the
pain
i
have
given
you
it
has
been
more
a
relief
than
a
shame
to
have
all
this
known
to
you
and
even
if
you
should
despise
me
i
don
t
despise
you
that
isn
t
for
me
but
oh
i
wish
that
i
could
help
you
don
ippolito
shook
his
head
you
can
not
help
me
but
i
thank
you
for
your
compassion
i
shall
never
forget
he
lingered
irresolutely
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
shall
we
go
on
with
the
reading
madamigella
no
we
will
not
read
any
more
she
answered
then
i
relieve
you
of
the
disturbance
madamigella
he
said
and
after
a
moment
s
hesitation
he
bowed
sadly
and
went
she
mechanically
followed
him
to
the
door
with
some
little
gestures
and
movements
of
a
desire
to
keep
him
from
going
yet
let
him
go
and
so
turned
back
and
sat
down
with
her
hands
resting
noiseless
on
the
keys
of
the
piano
xi
the
next
morning
don
ippolito
did
not
come
but
in
the
afternoon
the
postman
brought
a
letter
for
vervain
couched
in
the
priest
s
english
begging
her
indulgence
until
after
the
day
of
corpus
christi
up
to
which
time
he
said
he
should
be
too
occupied
for
his
visits
of
ordinary
this
letter
reminded
vervain
that
they
had
not
seen
ferris
for
three
days
and
she
sent
to
ask
him
to
dinner
but
he
returned
an
excuse
and
he
was
not
to
be
had
to
breakfast
the
next
morning
for
the
asking
he
was
in
open
rebellion
vervain
had
herself
rowed
to
the
consular
landing
and
sent
up
her
gondolier
with
another
invitation
to
dinner
the
painter
appeared
on
the
balcony
in
the
linen
blouse
which
he
wore
at
his
work
and
looked
down
with
a
frown
on
the
smiling
face
of
vervain
for
a
moment
without
speaking
then
i
ll
come
he
said
gloomily
come
with
me
then
returned
vervain
i
shall
have
to
keep
you
i
don
t
mind
that
you
ll
be
ready
in
five
florida
met
the
painter
with
such
gentleness
that
he
felt
his
resentment
to
have
been
a
stupid
caprice
for
which
there
was
no
ground
in
the
world
he
tried
to
recall
his
fading
sense
of
outrage
but
he
found
nothing
in
his
mind
but
penitence
the
sort
of
distraught
humility
with
which
she
behaved
gave
her
a
novel
fascination
the
dinner
was
good
as
vervain
s
dinners
always
were
and
there
was
a
compliment
to
the
painter
in
the
presence
of
a
favorite
dish
when
he
saw
this
well
vervain
what
is
it
he
asked
you
needn
t
pretend
that
you
re
treating
me
so
well
for
nothing
you
want
we
want
nothing
but
that
you
should
not
neglect
your
friends
we
have
been
utterly
deserted
for
three
or
four
days
don
ippolito
has
not
been
here
either
but
has
some
excuse
he
has
to
get
ready
for
corpus
christi
he
s
going
to
be
in
the
is
he
to
appear
with
his
flying
machine
or
his
portable
or
his
automatic
camera
for
shame
cried
vervain
beaming
reproach
florida
s
face
clouded
and
ferris
made
haste
to
say
that
he
did
not
know
these
inventions
were
sacred
and
that
he
had
no
wish
to
blaspheme
them
you
know
well
enough
what
i
meant
answered
vervain
and
now
we
want
you
to
get
us
a
window
to
look
out
on
the
oh
what
you
want
is
it
i
thought
you
merely
wanted
me
not
to
neglect
my
well
do
you
call
that
neglecting
them
mrs
vervain
vervain
what
a
mind
you
have
is
there
anything
else
you
want
me
to
go
with
you
for
example
we
don
t
insist
you
can
take
us
to
the
window
and
leave
us
if
you
this
clemency
is
indeed
unexpected
replied
ferris
i
m
really
quite
unworthy
of
he
was
going
on
with
the
badinage
customary
between
vervain
and
himself
when
florida
protested
mother
i
think
we
abuse
ferris
s
i
know
it
my
dear
i
know
it
cheerfully
assented
vervain
it
s
perfectly
shocking
but
what
are
we
to
do
we
must
abuse
we
had
better
stay
at
home
i
d
much
rather
not
go
said
the
girl
tremulously
why
miss
vervain
said
ferris
gravely
i
m
very
sorry
if
you
ve
misunderstood
my
joking
i
ve
never
yet
seen
the
procession
to
advantage
and
i
d
like
very
much
to
look
on
with
he
could
not
tell
whether
she
was
grateful
for
his
words
or
annoyed
she
resolutely
said
no
more
but
her
mother
took
up
the
strain
and
discoursed
long
upon
it
arranging
all
the
particulars
of
their
meeting
and
going
together
ferris
was
a
little
piqued
and
began
to
wonder
why
miss
vervain
did
not
stay
at
home
if
she
did
not
want
to
go
to
be
sure
she
went
everywhere
with
her
mother
but
it
was
strange
with
her
habitual
violent
submissiveness
that
she
should
have
said
anything
in
opposition
to
her
mother
s
wish
or
purpose
after
dinner
vervain
frankly
withdrew
for
her
nap
and
florida
seemed
to
make
a
little
haste
to
take
some
sewing
in
her
hand
and
sat
down
with
the
air
of
a
woman
willing
to
detain
her
visitor
ferris
was
not
such
a
stoic
as
not
to
be
dimly
flattered
by
this
but
he
was
too
much
of
a
man
to
be
fully
aware
how
great
an
advance
it
might
seem
i
suppose
we
shall
see
most
of
the
priests
of
venice
and
what
they
are
like
in
the
procession
she
said
do
you
remember
speaking
to
me
about
priests
the
other
day
ferris
yes
i
remember
it
very
well
i
think
i
overdid
it
and
i
couldn
t
perceive
afterwards
that
i
had
shown
any
motive
but
a
desire
to
make
trouble
for
don
i
never
thought
that
answered
florida
seriously
what
you
said
was
true
wasn
t
it
yes
it
was
and
it
wasn
t
and
i
don
t
know
that
it
differed
from
anything
else
in
the
world
in
that
respect
it
is
true
that
there
is
a
great
distrust
of
the
priests
amongst
the
italians
the
young
men
hate
them
or
think
they
do
or
say
they
do
most
educated
men
in
middle
life
are
materialists
and
of
course
unfriendly
to
the
priests
there
are
even
women
who
are
skeptical
about
religion
but
i
suspect
that
the
largest
number
of
all
those
who
talk
loudest
against
the
priests
are
really
subject
to
them
you
must
consider
how
very
intimately
they
are
bound
up
with
every
family
in
the
most
solemn
relations
of
do
you
think
the
priests
are
generally
bad
men
asked
the
young
girl
shyly
i
don
t
indeed
i
don
t
see
how
things
could
hang
together
if
it
were
so
there
must
be
a
great
basis
of
sincerity
and
goodness
in
them
when
all
is
said
and
done
it
seems
to
me
that
at
the
worst
they
re
merely
professional
people
poor
fellows
who
have
gone
into
the
church
for
a
living
you
know
it
isn
t
often
now
that
the
sons
of
noble
families
take
orders
the
priests
are
mostly
of
humble
origin
not
that
they
re
necessarily
the
worse
for
that
the
patricians
used
to
be
just
as
bad
in
another
i
wonder
said
florida
with
her
head
on
one
side
considering
her
seam
why
there
is
always
something
so
dreadful
to
us
in
the
idea
of
a
they
seem
a
kind
of
alien
creature
to
us
protestants
i
can
t
make
out
whether
they
seem
so
to
catholics
or
not
but
we
have
a
repugnance
to
all
doomed
people
haven
t
we
and
a
priest
is
a
man
under
sentence
of
death
to
the
natural
ties
between
himself
and
the
human
race
he
is
dead
to
us
that
makes
him
dreadful
the
spectre
of
our
dearest
friend
father
or
mother
would
be
terrible
and
yet
added
ferris
musingly
a
nun
isn
t
no
answered
the
girl
that
s
because
a
woman
s
life
even
in
the
world
seems
to
be
a
constant
giving
up
no
a
nun
isn
t
unnatural
but
a
priest
she
was
silent
for
a
time
in
which
she
sewed
swiftly
then
she
suddenly
dropped
her
work
into
her
lap
and
pressing
it
down
with
both
hands
she
asked
do
you
believe
that
priests
themselves
are
ever
skeptical
about
religion
i
suppose
it
must
happen
now
and
then
in
the
best
days
of
the
church
it
was
a
fashion
to
doubt
you
know
i
ve
often
wanted
to
ask
our
friend
don
ippolito
something
about
these
matters
but
i
didn
t
see
how
it
could
be
ferris
did
not
note
the
change
that
passed
over
florida
s
face
and
he
continued
our
acquaintance
hasn
t
become
so
intimate
as
i
hoped
it
might
but
you
only
get
to
a
certain
point
with
italians
they
like
to
meet
you
on
the
street
maybe
they
haven
t
any
yes
it
must
sometimes
happen
as
you
say
replied
florida
with
a
quick
sigh
reverting
to
the
beginning
of
ferris
s
answer
but
is
it
any
worse
for
a
false
priest
than
for
a
hypocritical
minister
it
s
bad
enough
for
either
but
it
s
worse
for
the
priest
you
see
miss
vervain
a
minister
doesn
t
set
up
for
so
much
he
doesn
t
pretend
to
forgive
us
our
sins
and
he
doesn
t
ask
us
to
confess
them
he
doesn
t
offer
us
the
veritable
body
and
blood
in
the
sacrament
and
he
doesn
t
bear
allegiance
to
the
visible
and
tangible
vicegerent
of
christ
upon
earth
a
hypocritical
parson
may
be
absurd
but
a
skeptical
priest
is
yes
oh
yes
i
see
murmured
the
girl
with
a
grieving
face
are
they
always
to
blame
for
it
they
must
be
induced
sometimes
to
enter
the
church
before
they
ve
seriously
thought
about
it
and
then
don
t
know
how
to
escape
from
the
path
that
has
been
marked
out
for
them
from
their
childhood
should
you
think
such
a
priest
as
that
was
to
blame
for
being
a
skeptic
she
asked
very
earnestly
no
said
ferris
with
a
smile
at
her
seriousness
i
should
think
such
a
skeptic
as
that
was
to
blame
for
being
a
shouldn
t
you
be
very
sorry
for
him
pursued
florida
still
more
solemnly
i
should
indeed
if
i
liked
him
if
i
didn
t
i
m
afraid
i
shouldn
t
said
ferris
but
he
saw
that
his
levity
jarred
upon
her
come
miss
vervain
you
re
not
going
to
look
at
those
fat
monks
and
sleek
priests
in
the
procession
as
so
many
incorporate
tragedies
are
you
you
ll
spoil
my
pleasure
if
you
do
i
dare
say
they
ll
be
all
of
them
devout
believers
accepting
everything
down
to
the
animalcula
in
the
holy
if
were
that
kind
of
a
priest
persisted
the
girl
without
heeding
his
jests
what
should
you
do
upon
my
word
i
don
t
know
i
can
t
imagine
it
why
he
continued
think
what
a
helpless
creature
a
priest
is
in
everything
but
his
priesthood
more
helpless
than
a
woman
even
the
only
thing
he
could
do
would
be
to
leave
the
church
and
how
could
he
do
that
he
s
in
the
world
but
he
isn
t
of
it
and
i
don
t
see
what
he
could
do
with
it
or
it
with
him
if
an
italian
priest
were
to
leave
the
church
even
the
liberals
who
distrust
him
now
would
despise
him
still
more
do
you
know
that
they
have
a
pleasant
fashion
of
calling
the
protestant
converts
apostates
the
first
thing
for
such
a
priest
would
be
exile
but
i
m
not
supposably
the
kind
of
priest
you
mean
and
i
don
t
think
just
such
a
priest
supposable
i
dare
say
if
a
priest
found
himself
drifting
into
doubt
he
d
try
to
avoid
the
disagreeable
subject
and
if
he
couldn
t
he
d
philosophize
it
some
way
and
wouldn
t
let
his
skepticism
worry
then
you
mean
that
they
haven
t
consciences
like
us
they
have
consciences
but
not
like
us
the
italians
are
kinder
people
than
we
are
but
they
re
not
so
just
and
i
should
say
that
they
don
t
think
truth
the
chief
good
of
life
they
believe
there
are
pleasanter
and
better
things
perhaps
they
re
no
no
you
don
t
believe
that
you
know
you
don
t
said
florida
anxiously
and
you
haven
t
answered
my
oh
yes
i
have
i
ve
told
you
it
wasn
t
a
supposable
but
suppose
it
well
if
i
must
answered
ferris
with
a
laugh
with
my
unfortunate
bringing
up
i
couldn
t
say
less
than
that
such
a
man
ought
to
get
out
of
his
priesthood
at
any
hazard
he
should
cease
to
be
a
priest
if
it
cost
him
kindred
friends
good
fame
country
everything
i
don
t
see
how
there
can
be
any
living
in
such
a
lie
though
i
know
there
is
in
all
reason
it
ought
to
eat
the
soul
out
of
a
man
and
leave
him
helpless
to
do
or
be
any
sort
of
good
but
there
seems
to
be
something
i
don
t
know
what
it
is
that
is
above
all
reason
of
ours
something
that
saves
each
of
us
for
good
in
spite
of
the
bad
that
s
in
us
it
s
very
good
practice
for
a
man
who
wants
to
be
modest
to
come
and
live
in
a
latin
country
he
learns
to
suspect
his
own
topping
virtues
and
to
be
lenient
to
the
novel
combinations
of
right
and
wrong
that
he
sees
but
as
for
our
insupposable
priest
yes
i
should
say
decidedly
he
ought
to
get
out
of
it
by
all
florida
fell
back
in
her
chair
with
an
aspect
of
such
relief
as
comes
to
one
from
confirmation
on
an
important
point
she
passed
her
hand
over
the
sewing
in
her
lap
but
did
not
speak
ferris
went
on
with
a
doubting
look
at
her
for
he
had
been
shy
of
introducing
don
ippolito
s
name
since
the
day
on
the
brenta
and
he
did
not
know
what
effect
a
recurrence
to
him
in
this
talk
might
have
i
ve
often
wondered
if
our
own
clerical
friend
were
not
a
little
shaky
in
his
faith
i
don
t
think
nature
meant
him
for
a
priest
he
always
strikes
me
as
an
extremely
person
i
doubt
if
he
s
ever
put
the
question
whether
he
is
what
he
professes
to
be
squarely
to
himself
he
s
such
a
mere
florida
changed
her
posture
slightly
and
looked
down
at
her
sewing
she
asked
but
shouldn
t
you
abhor
him
if
he
were
a
skeptical
priest
ferris
shrugged
his
shoulders
oh
i
don
t
find
it
such
an
easy
matter
to
abhor
people
it
would
be
interesting
he
continued
musingly
to
have
such
a
dreamer
waked
up
once
and
suddenly
confronted
with
what
he
recognized
as
perfect
truthfulness
and
couldn
t
help
contrasting
himself
with
but
it
would
be
a
little
would
you
rather
have
him
left
as
he
was
asked
florida
lifting
her
eyes
to
his
as
a
moralist
no
as
a
humanitarian
yes
miss
vervain
he
d
be
much
happier
as
he
what
time
ought
we
to
be
ready
for
you
tomorrow
demanded
the
girl
in
a
tone
of
decision
we
ought
to
be
in
the
piazza
by
nine
o
clock
said
ferris
carelessly
accepting
the
change
of
subject
and
he
told
her
of
his
plan
for
seeing
the
procession
from
a
window
of
the
old
procuratie
when
he
rose
to
go
he
said
lightly
perhaps
after
all
we
may
see
the
type
of
tragical
priest
we
ve
been
talking
about
who
can
tell
i
say
his
nose
will
be
perhaps
answered
florida
with
unheeding
gravity
xii
the
day
was
one
of
those
which
can
come
to
the
world
only
in
early
june
at
venice
the
heaven
was
without
a
cloud
but
a
blue
haze
made
mystery
of
the
horizon
where
the
lagoon
and
sky
met
unseen
the
breath
of
the
sea
bathed
in
freshness
the
city
at
whose
feet
her
tides
sparkled
and
slept
the
great
square
of
mark
was
transformed
from
a
mart
from
a
to
a
temple
the
shops
under
the
colonnades
that
inclose
it
upon
three
sides
were
shut
the
caffès
before
which
the
circles
of
idle
and
ordinarily
spread
out
into
the
piazza
were
repressed
to
the
limits
of
their
own
doors
the
stands
of
the
the
baskets
of
those
that
sold
oranges
of
palermo
and
black
cherries
of
padua
had
vanished
from
the
base
of
the
church
of
mark
which
with
its
dim
splendor
of
mosaics
and
its
carven
luxury
of
pillar
and
arch
and
finial
rose
like
the
ineffably
rich
and
beautiful
of
the
vaster
temple
whose
inclosure
it
completed
before
it
stood
the
three
great
red
like
painted
tapers
before
an
altar
and
from
them
hung
the
austrian
flags
of
red
and
white
and
yellow
and
black
in
the
middle
of
the
square
stood
the
austrian
military
band
motionless
encircling
their
leader
with
his
staff
uplifted
during
the
night
a
light
colonnade
of
wood
roofed
with
blue
cloth
had
been
put
up
around
the
inside
of
the
piazza
and
under
this
now
paused
the
long
pomp
of
the
ecclesiastical
procession
the
priests
of
all
the
venetian
churches
in
their
richest
vestments
followed
in
their
order
by
facchini
in
white
sandals
and
gay
robes
with
caps
of
scarlet
white
green
and
blue
who
bore
huge
painted
candles
and
silken
banners
displaying
the
symbol
or
the
portrait
of
the
titular
saints
of
the
several
churches
and
supported
the
canopies
under
which
the
host
of
each
was
elevated
before
the
clergy
went
a
company
of
austrian
soldiers
and
behind
the
facchini
came
a
long
array
of
religious
societies
boys
in
uniforms
old
paupers
in
holiday
dress
little
naked
urchins
with
shepherds
crooks
and
bits
of
fleece
about
their
loins
like
john
the
baptist
in
the
wilderness
little
girls
with
angels
wings
and
crowns
the
monks
of
the
various
orders
and
civilian
penitents
of
all
sorts
in
cloaks
or
hooded
or
bareheaded
and
carrying
each
a
lighted
taper
the
corridors
under
the
imperial
palace
and
the
new
and
old
procuratie
were
packed
with
spectators
from
every
window
up
and
down
the
fronts
of
the
palaces
gay
stuffs
were
flung
the
startled
doves
of
mark
perched
upon
the
cornices
or
fluttered
uneasily
to
and
fro
above
the
crowd
the
baton
of
the
band
leader
descended
with
a
crash
of
martial
music
the
priests
chanted
the
sang
shrill
a
vast
noise
of
shuffling
feet
arose
mixed
with
the
rustling
of
the
sheets
of
tinsel
attached
to
the
banners
and
candles
in
the
procession
the
whole
strange
gorgeous
picture
came
to
life
after
all
her
plans
and
preparations
vervain
had
not
felt
well
enough
that
morning
to
come
to
the
spectacle
which
she
had
counted
so
much
upon
seeing
but
she
had
therefore
insisted
the
more
that
her
daughter
should
go
and
ferris
now
stood
with
florida
alone
at
a
window
in
the
old
procuratie
well
what
do
you
think
miss
vervain
he
asked
when
their
senses
had
somewhat
accustomed
themselves
to
the
noise
of
the
procession
do
you
say
now
that
venice
is
too
gloomy
a
city
to
have
ever
had
any
possibility
of
gayety
in
her
i
never
said
that
answered
florida
opening
her
eyes
upon
him
neither
did
i
returned
ferris
but
i
ve
often
thought
it
and
i
m
not
sure
now
but
i
m
right
there
s
something
extremely
melancholy
to
me
in
all
this
i
don
t
care
so
much
for
what
one
may
call
the
deplorable
superstition
expressed
in
the
spectacle
but
the
mere
splendid
sight
and
the
music
are
enough
to
make
one
shed
tears
i
don
t
know
anything
more
affecting
except
a
procession
of
gondolas
and
barges
on
the
grand
canal
it
s
phantasmal
it
s
the
spectral
resurrection
of
the
old
dead
forms
into
the
present
it
s
not
even
the
ghost
it
s
the
corpse
of
other
ages
that
s
haunting
venice
the
city
ought
to
have
been
destroyed
by
napoleon
when
he
destroyed
the
republic
and
thrown
overboard
mark
winged
lion
bucentaur
and
all
there
is
no
land
like
america
for
true
cheerfulness
and
think
of
our
fourth
of
julys
and
our
state
fairs
selah
ferris
looked
into
the
girl
s
serious
face
with
twinkling
eyes
he
liked
to
embarrass
her
gravity
with
his
antic
speeches
and
enjoyed
her
endeavors
to
find
an
earnest
meaning
in
them
and
her
evident
trouble
when
she
could
find
none
i
m
curious
to
know
how
our
friend
will
look
he
began
again
as
he
arranged
the
cushion
on
the
for
florida
s
greater
comfort
in
watching
the
spectacle
but
it
won
t
be
an
easy
matter
to
pick
him
out
in
this
masquerade
i
fancy
as
well
as
the
other
acts
of
devotion
seems
rather
out
of
character
with
don
ippolito
and
i
can
t
imagine
his
putting
much
soul
into
it
however
very
few
of
the
clergy
appear
to
do
that
look
at
those
holy
men
with
their
eyes
to
the
wind
they
are
wondering
who
is
the
at
the
window
florida
listened
to
his
persiflage
with
an
air
of
sad
distraction
she
was
intent
upon
the
procession
as
it
approached
from
the
other
side
of
the
piazza
and
she
replied
at
random
to
his
comments
on
the
different
bodies
that
formed
it
it
s
very
hard
to
decide
which
are
my
favorites
he
continued
surveying
the
long
column
through
an
my
religious
disadvantages
have
been
such
that
i
don
t
care
much
for
priests
or
monks
or
young
john
the
baptists
or
small
female
cherubim
but
i
do
like
little
with
voices
of
pins
and
needles
and
hair
cut
i
should
like
if
it
were
consistent
with
the
consular
dignity
to
go
down
and
rub
their
heads
i
m
fond
also
of
i
find
those
paupers
make
one
in
love
with
destitute
and
dependent
age
by
their
aspect
of
irresponsible
enjoyment
see
how
briskly
each
of
them
topples
along
on
the
leg
that
he
hasn
t
got
in
the
grave
how
attractive
likewise
are
the
civilian
devotees
in
those
imperishable
of
theirs
observe
their
high
collars
of
the
era
of
the
holy
alliance
they
and
their
fathers
and
their
grandfathers
before
them
have
worn
those
in
a
hundred
years
from
now
their
posterity
will
keep
holiday
in
them
i
should
like
to
know
the
elixir
by
which
the
of
civil
employees
render
themselves
immortal
those
penitents
in
the
cloaks
and
cowls
are
not
bad
either
miss
vervain
come
they
add
a
very
pretty
touch
of
mystery
to
this
spectacle
they
re
the
sort
of
thing
that
painters
are
expected
to
paint
in
venice
that
people
sigh
over
as
so
peculiarly
venetian
if
you
ve
a
single
sentiment
about
you
miss
vervain
now
is
the
time
to
produce
but
i
haven
t
i
m
afraid
i
have
no
sentiment
at
all
answered
the
girl
ruefully
but
this
makes
me
dreadfully
why
that
s
just
what
i
was
saying
a
while
ago
excuse
me
miss
vervain
but
your
sadness
lacks
novelty
it
s
a
sort
of
don
t
please
she
pleaded
yet
more
earnestly
i
was
just
thinking
i
don
t
know
why
such
an
awful
thought
should
come
to
me
that
it
might
all
be
a
mistake
after
all
perhaps
there
might
not
be
any
other
world
and
every
bit
of
this
power
and
display
of
the
church
church
as
well
as
the
rest
might
be
only
a
cruel
blunder
a
dreadful
mistake
perhaps
there
isn
t
even
any
god
do
you
think
there
is
i
don
t
it
said
ferris
gravely
i
it
but
i
don
t
wonder
that
this
sight
makes
you
doubt
great
god
how
far
it
is
from
christ
look
there
at
those
troops
who
go
before
the
followers
of
the
lamb
their
trade
is
murder
in
a
minute
if
a
dozen
men
called
out
long
live
the
king
of
italy
it
would
be
the
duty
of
those
soldiers
to
fire
into
the
helpless
crowd
look
at
the
silken
and
gilded
pomp
of
the
servants
of
the
carpenter
s
son
look
at
those
miserable
monks
voluntary
prisoners
beggars
aliens
to
their
kind
look
at
those
penitents
who
think
that
they
can
get
forgiveness
for
their
sins
by
carrying
a
candle
round
the
square
and
it
is
nearly
two
thousand
years
since
the
world
turned
christian
it
is
pretty
slow
but
i
suppose
god
lets
men
learn
him
from
their
own
experience
of
evil
i
imagine
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
a
sort
of
republic
and
that
god
draws
men
to
him
only
through
their
perfect
yes
yes
it
must
be
so
answered
florida
staring
down
on
the
crowd
with
unseeing
eyes
but
i
can
t
fix
my
mind
on
it
i
keep
thinking
the
whole
time
of
what
we
were
talking
about
yesterday
i
never
could
have
dreamed
of
a
priest
s
disbelieving
but
now
i
can
t
dream
of
anything
else
it
seems
to
me
that
none
of
these
priests
or
monks
can
believe
anything
their
faces
look
false
and
sly
and
bad
of
them
no
no
miss
vervain
said
ferris
smiling
at
her
despair
you
push
matters
a
little
beyond
as
a
woman
has
a
right
to
do
of
course
i
don
t
think
their
faces
are
bad
by
any
means
some
of
them
are
dull
and
torpid
and
some
are
frivolous
just
like
the
faces
of
other
people
but
i
ve
been
noticing
the
number
of
good
kind
friendly
faces
and
they
re
in
the
majority
just
as
they
are
amongst
other
people
for
there
are
very
few
souls
altogether
out
of
drawing
in
my
opinion
i
ve
even
caught
sight
of
some
faces
in
which
there
was
a
real
rapture
of
devotion
and
now
and
then
a
very
innocent
one
here
for
instance
is
a
man
i
should
like
to
bet
on
if
he
d
only
look
the
priest
whom
ferris
indicated
was
slowly
advancing
toward
the
space
immediately
under
their
window
he
was
dressed
in
robes
of
high
ceremony
and
in
his
hand
he
carried
a
lighted
taper
he
moved
with
a
gentle
tread
and
the
droop
of
his
slender
figure
intimated
a
sort
of
despairing
weariness
while
most
of
his
fellows
stared
carelessly
or
curiously
about
them
his
face
was
downcast
and
averted
suddenly
the
procession
paused
and
a
hush
fell
upon
the
vast
assembly
then
the
silence
was
broken
by
the
rustle
and
stir
of
all
those
thousands
going
down
upon
their
knees
as
the
lifted
his
hands
to
bless
them
the
priest
upon
whom
ferris
and
florida
had
fixed
their
eyes
faltered
a
moment
and
before
he
knelt
his
next
neighbor
had
to
pluck
him
by
the
skirt
then
he
too
knelt
hastily
mechanically
lifting
his
head
and
glancing
along
the
front
of
the
old
procuratie
his
face
had
that
weariness
in
it
which
his
figure
and
movement
had
suggested
and
it
was
very
pale
but
it
was
yet
more
singular
for
the
troubled
innocence
which
its
traits
expressed
there
whispered
ferris
that
s
what
i
call
an
uncommonly
good
florida
raised
her
hand
to
silence
him
and
the
heavy
gaze
of
the
priest
rested
on
them
coldly
at
first
then
a
light
of
recognition
shot
into
his
eyes
and
a
flush
suffused
his
pallid
visage
which
seemed
to
grow
the
more
haggard
and
desperate
his
head
fell
again
and
he
dropped
the
candle
from
his
hand
one
of
those
beggars
who
went
by
the
side
of
the
procession
to
gather
the
drippings
of
the
tapers
restored
it
to
him
why
said
ferris
aloud
it
s
don
ippolito
did
you
know
him
at
first
xiii
the
ladies
were
sitting
on
the
terrace
when
don
ippolito
came
next
morning
to
say
that
he
could
not
read
with
miss
vervain
that
day
nor
for
several
days
after
alleging
in
excuse
some
priestly
duties
proper
to
the
time
vervain
began
to
lament
that
she
had
not
been
able
to
go
to
the
procession
of
the
day
before
i
meant
to
have
kept
a
sharp
lookout
for
you
florida
saw
you
and
so
did
ferris
but
it
isn
t
at
all
the
same
thing
you
know
florida
has
no
faculty
for
describing
and
now
i
shall
probably
go
away
from
venice
without
seeing
you
in
your
real
character
don
ippolito
suffered
this
and
more
in
meek
silence
he
waited
his
opportunity
with
unfailing
politeness
and
then
with
gentle
punctilio
took
his
leave
well
come
again
as
soon
as
your
duties
will
let
you
don
ippolito
cried
vervain
we
shall
miss
you
dreadfully
and
i
begrudge
every
one
of
your
readings
that
florida
the
priest
passed
with
the
sliding
step
which
his
impeding
drapery
imposed
down
the
garden
walk
and
was
to
the
gate
when
florida
who
had
stood
watching
him
said
to
her
mother
i
must
speak
to
him
again
and
lightly
descended
the
steps
and
swiftly
glided
in
pursuit
don
ippolito
she
called
he
already
had
his
hand
upon
the
gate
but
he
turned
and
rapidly
went
back
to
meet
her
she
stood
in
the
walk
where
she
had
stopped
when
her
voice
arrested
him
breathing
quickly
their
eyes
met
a
painful
shadow
overcast
the
face
of
the
young
girl
who
seemed
to
be
trying
in
vain
to
speak
vervain
put
on
her
glasses
and
peered
down
at
the
two
with
curiosity
well
madamigella
said
the
priest
at
last
what
do
you
command
me
he
gave
a
faint
patient
sigh
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
oh
she
began
vehemently
i
wish
there
was
some
one
who
had
the
right
to
speak
to
you
no
one
answered
don
ippolito
has
so
much
the
right
as
i
saw
you
yesterday
she
began
again
and
i
thought
of
what
you
had
told
me
don
yes
i
thought
of
it
too
answered
the
priest
i
have
thought
of
it
ever
but
haven
t
you
thought
of
any
hope
for
yourself
must
you
still
go
on
as
before
how
can
you
go
back
now
to
those
things
and
pretend
to
think
them
holy
and
all
the
time
have
no
heart
or
faith
in
them
it
s
terrible
what
would
you
madamigella
demanded
don
ippolito
with
a
moody
shrug
it
is
my
profession
my
trade
you
know
you
might
say
to
the
prisoner
he
added
bitterly
it
is
terrible
to
see
you
chained
yes
it
is
terrible
oh
i
don
t
reject
your
compassion
but
what
can
i
do
sit
down
with
me
here
said
florida
in
her
blunt
way
and
sank
upon
the
stone
seat
beside
the
walk
she
clasped
her
hands
together
in
her
lap
with
some
strong
bashful
emotion
while
don
ippolito
obeying
her
command
waited
for
her
to
speak
her
voice
was
scarcely
more
than
a
hoarse
whisper
when
she
began
i
don
t
know
how
to
begin
what
i
want
to
say
i
am
not
fit
to
advise
any
one
i
am
so
young
and
so
very
ignorant
of
the
i
too
know
little
of
the
world
said
the
priest
as
much
to
himself
as
to
her
it
may
be
all
wrong
all
wrong
besides
she
said
abruptly
how
do
i
know
that
you
are
a
good
man
don
ippolito
how
do
i
know
that
you
ve
been
telling
me
the
truth
it
may
be
all
a
kind
of
trap
he
looked
blankly
at
her
this
is
in
venice
and
you
may
be
leading
me
on
to
say
things
to
you
that
will
make
trouble
for
my
mother
and
me
you
may
be
a
spy
oh
no
no
no
cried
the
priest
springing
to
his
feet
with
a
kind
of
moan
and
a
shudder
god
forbid
he
swiftly
touched
her
hand
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
and
then
kissed
them
an
action
of
inexpressible
humility
madamigella
i
swear
to
you
by
everything
you
believe
good
that
i
would
rather
die
than
be
false
to
you
in
a
single
breath
or
oh
i
know
it
i
know
it
she
murmured
i
don
t
see
how
i
could
say
such
a
cruel
not
cruel
no
madamigella
not
cruel
softly
pleaded
don
ippolito
but
but
is
there
escape
for
you
they
looked
steadfastly
at
each
other
for
a
moment
and
then
don
ippolito
spoke
yes
he
said
very
gravely
there
is
one
way
of
escape
i
have
often
thought
of
it
and
once
i
thought
i
had
taken
the
first
step
towards
it
but
it
is
beset
with
many
great
obstacles
and
to
be
a
priest
makes
one
timid
and
he
lapsed
into
his
musing
melancholy
with
the
last
words
but
she
would
not
suffer
him
to
lose
whatever
heart
he
had
begun
to
speak
with
that
s
nothing
she
said
you
must
think
again
of
that
way
of
escape
and
never
turn
from
it
till
you
have
tried
it
only
take
the
first
step
and
you
can
go
on
friends
will
rise
up
everywhere
and
make
it
easy
for
you
come
she
implored
him
fervently
you
must
he
bent
his
dreamy
eyes
upon
her
if
i
should
take
this
only
way
of
escape
and
it
seemed
desperate
to
all
others
would
you
still
be
my
friend
i
should
be
your
friend
if
the
whole
world
turned
against
would
you
be
my
friend
he
asked
eagerly
in
lower
tones
and
with
signs
of
an
inward
struggle
if
this
way
of
escape
were
for
me
to
be
no
longer
a
priest
oh
yes
yes
why
not
cried
the
girl
and
her
face
glowed
with
heroic
sympathy
and
defiance
it
is
from
this
ignorance
in
women
of
the
insuperable
difficulties
of
doing
right
that
men
take
fire
and
accomplish
the
sublime
impossibilities
our
sense
of
details
our
fatal
habits
of
reasoning
paralyze
us
we
need
the
impulse
of
the
pure
ideal
which
we
can
get
only
from
them
these
two
were
alike
children
as
regarded
the
world
but
he
had
a
man
s
dark
prevision
of
the
means
and
she
a
heavenly
scorn
of
everything
but
the
end
to
be
achieved
he
drew
a
long
breath
then
it
does
not
seem
terrible
to
you
terrible
no
i
don
t
see
how
you
can
rest
till
it
is
done
is
it
true
then
that
you
urge
me
to
this
step
which
indeed
i
have
so
long
desired
to
take
yes
it
is
true
listen
don
ippolito
it
is
the
very
thing
that
i
hoped
you
would
do
but
i
wanted
you
to
speak
of
it
first
you
must
have
all
the
honor
of
it
and
i
am
glad
you
thought
of
it
before
you
will
never
regret
it
she
smiled
radiantly
upon
him
and
he
kindled
at
her
enthusiasm
in
another
moment
his
face
darkened
again
but
it
will
cost
much
he
murmured
no
matter
cried
florida
such
a
man
as
you
ought
to
leave
the
priesthood
at
any
risk
or
hazard
you
should
cease
to
be
a
priest
if
it
cost
you
kindred
friends
good
fame
country
everything
she
blushed
with
irrelevant
consciousness
why
need
you
be
downhearted
with
your
genius
once
free
you
can
make
country
and
fame
and
friends
everywhere
leave
venice
there
are
other
places
think
how
inventors
succeed
in
america
in
america
exclaimed
the
priest
ah
how
long
i
have
desired
to
be
there
you
must
go
you
will
soon
be
famous
and
honored
there
and
you
shall
not
be
a
stranger
even
at
the
first
do
you
know
that
we
are
going
home
very
soon
yes
my
mother
and
i
have
been
talking
of
it
we
are
both
homesick
and
you
see
that
she
is
not
well
you
shall
come
to
us
there
and
make
our
house
your
home
till
you
have
formed
some
plans
of
your
own
everything
will
be
easy
god
good
she
said
in
a
breaking
voice
and
you
may
be
sure
he
will
befriend
some
one
answered
don
ippolito
with
tears
in
his
eyes
has
already
been
very
good
to
me
i
thought
it
was
you
but
i
will
call
it
god
hush
you
mustn
t
say
such
things
but
you
must
go
now
take
time
to
think
but
not
too
much
time
only
be
true
to
they
rose
and
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
with
an
instinctive
gesture
of
appeal
he
stood
bewildered
then
thanks
madamigella
thanks
he
said
and
caught
her
fragrant
hand
to
his
lips
he
loosed
it
and
lifted
both
his
arms
by
a
blind
impulse
in
which
he
arrested
himself
with
a
burning
blush
and
turned
away
he
did
not
take
leave
of
her
with
his
wonted
formalities
but
hurried
abruptly
toward
the
gate
a
panic
seemed
to
seize
her
as
she
saw
him
open
it
she
ran
after
him
don
ippolito
don
ippolito
she
said
coming
up
to
him
and
stammered
and
faltered
i
don
t
know
i
am
frightened
you
must
do
nothing
from
me
i
can
not
let
you
i
m
not
fit
to
advise
you
it
must
be
wholly
from
your
own
conscience
oh
no
don
t
look
so
i
be
your
friend
whatever
happens
but
if
what
you
think
of
doing
has
seemed
so
terrible
to
you
perhaps
it
more
terrible
than
i
can
understand
if
it
is
the
only
way
it
is
right
but
is
there
no
other
what
i
mean
is
have
you
no
one
to
talk
all
this
over
with
i
mean
can
t
you
speak
of
it
to
to
ferris
he
is
so
true
and
honest
and
i
was
going
to
him
said
don
ippolito
with
a
dim
trouble
in
his
face
oh
i
am
so
glad
of
that
remember
i
don
t
take
anything
back
no
matter
what
happens
i
will
be
your
friend
but
he
will
tell
you
just
what
to
don
ippolito
bowed
and
opened
the
gate
florida
went
back
to
her
mother
who
asked
her
what
in
the
world
have
you
and
don
ippolito
been
talking
about
so
earnestly
what
makes
you
so
pale
and
out
of
breath
i
have
been
wanting
to
tell
you
mother
said
florida
she
drew
her
chair
in
front
of
the
elder
lady
and
sat
down
xiv
don
ippolito
did
not
go
directly
to
the
painter
s
he
walked
toward
his
house
at
first
and
then
turned
aside
and
wandered
out
through
the
noisy
and
populous
district
of
canaregio
to
the
campo
di
marte
a
squad
of
cavalry
which
had
been
going
through
some
exercises
there
was
moving
off
the
parade
ground
a
few
infantry
soldiers
were
strolling
about
under
the
trees
don
ippolito
walked
across
the
field
to
the
border
of
the
lagoon
where
he
began
to
pace
to
and
fro
with
his
head
sunk
in
deep
thought
he
moved
rapidly
but
sometimes
he
stopped
and
stood
still
in
the
sun
whose
heat
he
did
not
seem
to
feel
though
a
perspiration
bathed
his
pale
face
and
stood
in
drops
on
his
forehead
under
the
shadow
of
his
nicchio
some
little
dirty
children
of
the
poor
with
which
this
region
swarms
looked
at
him
from
the
sloping
shore
of
the
campo
di
giustizia
where
the
executions
used
to
take
place
and
a
small
boy
began
to
mock
his
movements
and
pauses
but
was
arrested
by
one
of
the
girls
who
shook
him
and
gesticulated
warningly
at
this
point
the
long
railroad
bridge
which
connects
venice
with
the
mainland
is
in
full
sight
and
now
from
the
reverie
in
which
he
continued
whether
he
walked
or
stood
still
don
ippolito
was
roused
by
the
whistle
of
an
outward
train
he
followed
it
with
his
eye
as
it
streamed
along
over
the
arches
and
struck
out
into
the
flat
salt
marshes
beyond
when
the
distance
hid
it
he
put
on
his
hat
which
he
had
unknowingly
removed
and
turned
his
rapid
steps
toward
the
railroad
station
arrived
there
he
lingered
in
the
vestibule
for
half
an
hour
watching
the
people
as
they
bought
their
tickets
for
departure
and
had
their
baggage
examined
by
the
customs
officers
and
weighed
and
registered
by
the
railroad
porters
who
passed
it
through
the
wicket
shutting
out
the
train
while
the
passengers
gathered
up
their
smaller
parcels
and
took
their
way
to
the
he
followed
a
group
of
english
people
some
paces
in
this
direction
and
then
returned
to
the
wicket
through
which
he
looked
long
and
wistfully
at
the
train
the
baggage
was
all
passed
through
the
doors
of
the
were
thrown
open
with
harsh
proclamation
by
the
guards
and
the
passengers
flocked
into
the
carriages
whistles
and
bells
were
sounded
and
the
train
crept
out
of
the
station
a
man
in
the
company
s
uniform
approached
the
unconscious
priest
and
striking
his
hands
softly
together
said
with
a
pleasant
smile
your
servant
don
ippolito
are
you
expecting
some
one
ah
good
day
answered
the
priest
with
a
little
start
no
he
added
i
was
not
looking
for
any
i
see
said
the
other
amusing
yourself
as
usual
with
the
machinery
excuse
the
freedom
don
ippolito
but
you
ought
to
have
been
of
our
profession
ha
ha
when
you
have
the
leisure
i
should
like
to
show
you
the
drawing
of
an
american
locomotive
which
a
friend
of
mine
has
sent
me
from
nuova
york
it
is
very
different
from
ours
very
curious
but
monstrous
in
size
you
know
prodigious
may
i
come
with
it
to
your
house
some
evening
you
will
do
me
a
great
pleasure
said
don
ippolito
he
gazed
dreamily
in
the
direction
of
the
vanished
train
was
that
the
train
for
milan
he
asked
presently
exactly
said
the
man
does
it
go
all
the
way
to
milan
oh
no
it
stops
at
peschiera
where
the
passengers
have
their
passports
examined
and
then
another
train
backs
down
from
desenzano
and
takes
them
on
to
milan
and
after
that
continued
the
man
with
animation
if
you
are
on
the
way
to
england
for
example
another
train
carries
you
to
susa
and
there
you
get
the
diligence
over
the
mountain
to
michel
where
you
take
railroad
again
and
so
on
up
through
paris
to
and
then
by
steamer
to
folkestone
and
then
by
railroad
to
london
and
to
liverpool
it
is
at
liverpool
that
you
go
on
board
the
steamer
for
america
and
piff
in
ten
days
you
are
in
nuova
york
my
friend
has
written
me
all
about
ah
yes
your
friend
does
he
like
it
there
in
america
passably
passably
the
americans
have
no
manners
but
they
are
good
devils
they
are
governed
by
the
irish
and
the
wine
is
dear
but
he
likes
america
yes
he
likes
it
nuova
york
is
a
fine
city
but
immense
you
know
eight
times
as
large
as
venice
is
your
friend
prosperous
there
ah
heigh
that
is
the
prettiest
part
of
the
story
he
has
made
himself
rich
he
is
employed
by
a
large
house
to
make
designs
for
mantlepieces
and
marble
tables
and
tombs
and
he
has
listen
six
hundred
francs
a
month
oh
per
bacco
cried
don
ippolito
honestly
but
you
spend
a
great
deal
there
still
it
is
magnificent
is
it
not
if
it
were
not
for
that
blessed
war
there
now
that
would
be
the
place
for
you
don
ippolito
he
tells
me
the
americans
are
actually
mad
for
inventions
your
servant
excuse
the
freedom
you
know
said
the
man
bowing
and
moving
away
nothing
dear
nothing
answered
the
priest
he
walked
out
of
the
station
with
a
light
step
and
went
to
his
own
house
where
he
sought
the
room
in
which
his
inventions
were
stored
he
had
not
touched
them
for
weeks
they
were
all
dusty
and
many
were
cobwebbed
he
blew
the
dust
from
some
and
bringing
them
to
the
light
examined
them
critically
finding
them
mostly
disabled
in
one
way
or
other
except
the
models
of
the
portable
furniture
which
he
polished
with
his
handkerchief
and
set
apart
surveying
them
from
a
distance
with
a
look
of
hope
he
took
up
the
cannon
and
then
suddenly
put
it
down
again
with
a
little
shiver
and
went
to
the
threshold
of
the
perverted
oratory
and
glanced
in
at
his
forge
veneranda
had
carelessly
left
the
window
open
and
the
draught
had
carried
the
ashes
about
the
floor
on
the
lay
the
tools
which
he
had
used
in
mending
the
broken
pipe
of
the
fountain
at
casa
vervain
and
had
not
used
since
the
place
seemed
chilly
even
on
that
summer
s
day
he
stood
in
the
doorway
with
clenched
hands
then
he
called
veneranda
chid
her
for
leaving
the
window
open
and
bade
her
close
it
and
so
quitted
the
house
and
left
her
muttering
ferris
seemed
surprised
to
see
him
when
he
appeared
at
the
consulate
near
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
and
seated
himself
in
the
place
where
he
was
wont
to
pose
for
the
painter
were
you
going
to
give
me
a
sitting
asked
the
latter
hesitating
the
light
is
horrible
just
now
with
this
glare
from
the
canal
not
that
i
manage
much
better
when
it
s
good
i
don
t
get
on
with
you
don
ippolito
there
are
too
many
of
you
i
shouldn
t
have
known
you
in
the
procession
don
ippolito
did
not
respond
he
rose
and
went
toward
his
portrait
on
the
easel
and
examined
it
long
with
a
curious
minuteness
then
he
returned
to
his
chair
and
continued
to
look
at
it
i
suppose
that
it
resembles
me
a
great
deal
he
said
and
yet
i
do
not
like
that
i
hardly
know
what
is
the
fault
it
is
as
i
should
be
if
i
were
like
other
priests
perhaps
i
know
it
s
not
good
said
the
painter
it
conventional
in
spite
of
everything
but
here
s
that
first
sketch
i
made
of
he
took
up
a
canvas
facing
the
wall
and
set
it
on
the
easel
the
character
in
this
charcoal
sketch
was
vastly
sincerer
and
sweeter
ah
said
don
ippolito
with
a
sigh
and
smile
of
relief
that
is
immeasurably
better
i
wish
i
could
speak
to
you
dear
friend
in
a
mood
of
yours
as
sympathetic
as
this
picture
records
of
some
matters
that
concern
me
very
nearly
i
have
just
come
from
the
railroad
seeing
some
friends
off
asked
the
painter
indifferently
hovering
near
the
sketch
with
a
bit
of
charcoal
in
his
hand
and
hesitating
whether
to
give
it
a
certain
touch
he
glanced
with
eyes
at
the
priest
don
ippolito
sighed
again
i
hardly
know
i
was
seeing
off
my
hopes
my
desires
my
prayers
that
followed
the
train
to
america
the
painter
put
down
his
charcoal
dusted
his
fingers
and
looked
at
the
priest
without
saying
anything
do
you
remember
when
i
first
came
to
you
asked
don
ippolito
certainly
said
ferris
is
it
of
that
matter
you
want
to
speak
to
me
i
m
very
sorry
to
hear
it
for
i
don
t
think
it
practical
practical
cried
the
priest
hotly
nothing
is
practical
till
it
has
been
tried
and
why
should
i
not
go
to
america
because
you
can
t
get
your
passport
for
one
thing
answered
the
painter
dryly
i
have
thought
of
that
rejoined
don
ippolito
more
patiently
i
can
get
a
passport
for
france
from
the
austrian
authorities
here
and
at
milan
there
must
be
ways
in
which
i
could
change
it
for
one
from
my
own
king
it
was
by
this
title
that
patriotic
venetians
of
those
days
spoke
of
victor
emmanuel
that
would
carry
me
out
of
france
into
ferris
pondered
a
moment
that
is
quite
true
he
said
why
hadn
t
you
thought
of
that
when
you
first
came
to
me
i
can
not
tell
i
didn
t
know
that
i
could
even
get
a
passport
for
france
till
the
other
both
were
silent
while
the
painter
filled
his
pipe
well
he
said
presently
i
m
very
sorry
i
m
afraid
you
re
dooming
yourself
to
many
bitter
disappointments
in
going
to
america
what
do
you
expect
to
do
there
why
with
my
inventions
i
suppose
interrupted
the
other
putting
a
lighted
match
to
his
pipe
that
a
painter
must
be
a
very
poor
sort
of
american
first
thought
is
of
coming
to
italy
so
i
know
very
little
directly
about
the
fortunes
of
my
inventive
or
whether
an
inventor
has
any
prospect
of
making
a
living
but
once
when
i
was
at
washington
i
went
into
the
patent
office
where
the
models
of
the
inventions
are
deposited
the
building
is
about
as
large
as
the
ducal
palace
and
it
is
full
of
them
the
people
there
told
me
nothing
was
commoner
than
for
the
same
invention
to
be
repeated
over
and
over
again
by
different
inventors
some
few
succeed
and
then
they
have
lawsuits
with
the
infringers
of
their
patents
some
sell
out
their
inventions
for
a
trifle
to
companies
that
have
capital
and
that
grow
rich
upon
them
the
great
number
can
never
bring
their
ideas
to
the
public
notice
at
all
you
can
judge
for
yourself
what
your
chances
would
be
you
have
asked
me
why
you
should
not
go
to
america
well
because
i
think
you
would
starve
i
am
used
to
that
said
don
ippolito
and
besides
until
some
of
my
inventions
became
known
i
could
give
lessons
in
oh
bravo
said
ferris
you
prefer
instant
death
then
but
madamigella
seemed
to
believe
that
my
success
as
an
inventor
would
be
assured
ferris
gave
a
very
ironical
laugh
miss
vervain
must
have
been
about
twelve
years
old
when
she
left
america
even
a
lady
s
knowledge
of
business
at
that
age
is
limited
when
did
you
talk
with
her
about
it
you
had
not
spoken
of
it
to
me
of
late
and
i
thought
you
were
more
contented
than
you
used
to
it
is
true
said
the
priest
sometimes
within
the
last
two
months
i
have
almost
forgotten
and
what
has
brought
it
so
forcibly
to
your
mind
again
that
is
what
i
so
greatly
desire
to
tell
you
replied
don
ippolito
with
an
appealing
look
at
the
painter
s
face
he
moistened
his
parched
lips
a
little
waiting
for
further
question
from
the
painter
to
whom
he
seemed
a
man
fevered
by
some
strong
emotion
and
at
that
moment
not
quite
wholesome
ferris
did
not
speak
and
don
ippolito
began
again
even
though
i
have
not
said
so
in
words
to
you
dear
friend
has
it
not
appeared
to
you
that
i
have
no
heart
in
my
vocation
yes
i
have
sometimes
fancied
that
i
had
no
right
to
ask
you
some
day
i
will
tell
you
when
i
have
the
courage
to
go
all
over
it
again
it
is
partly
my
own
fault
but
it
is
more
my
miserable
fortune
but
wherever
the
wrong
lies
it
has
at
last
become
intolerable
to
me
i
can
not
endure
it
any
longer
and
live
i
must
go
away
i
must
fly
from
ferris
shrank
from
him
a
little
as
men
instinctively
do
from
one
who
has
set
himself
upon
some
desperate
attempt
do
you
mean
don
ippolito
that
you
are
going
to
renounce
your
priesthood
don
ippolito
opened
his
hands
and
let
his
priesthood
drop
as
it
were
to
the
ground
you
never
spoke
of
this
before
when
you
talked
of
going
to
america
though
to
be
sure
yes
yes
replied
don
ippolito
with
vehemence
but
now
an
angel
has
appeared
and
shown
me
the
blackness
of
my
life
ferris
began
to
wonder
if
he
or
don
ippolito
were
not
perhaps
mad
an
angel
yes
the
priest
went
on
rising
from
his
chair
an
angel
whose
immaculate
truth
has
mirrored
my
falsehood
in
all
its
vileness
and
distortion
to
whom
if
it
destroys
me
i
can
not
devote
less
than
a
truthfulness
like
hers
hers
hers
cried
the
painter
with
a
sudden
pang
whose
don
t
speak
in
these
riddles
whom
do
you
mean
whom
can
i
mean
but
only
one
madamigella
miss
vervain
do
you
mean
to
say
that
miss
vervain
has
advised
you
to
renounce
your
priesthood
in
as
many
words
she
has
bidden
me
forsake
it
at
any
risk
at
the
cost
of
kindred
friends
good
fame
country
the
painter
passed
his
hand
confusedly
over
his
face
these
were
his
own
words
the
words
he
had
used
in
speaking
with
florida
of
the
supposed
skeptical
priest
he
grew
very
pale
may
i
ask
he
demanded
in
a
hard
dry
voice
how
she
came
to
advise
such
a
step
i
can
hardly
tell
something
had
already
moved
her
to
learn
from
me
the
story
of
my
life
to
know
that
i
was
a
man
with
neither
faith
nor
hope
her
pure
heart
was
torn
by
the
thought
of
my
wrong
and
of
my
error
i
had
never
seen
myself
in
such
deformity
as
she
saw
me
even
when
she
used
me
with
that
divine
compassion
i
was
almost
glad
to
be
what
i
was
because
of
her
angelic
pity
for
me
the
tears
sprang
to
don
ippolito
s
eyes
but
ferris
asked
in
the
same
tone
as
before
was
it
then
that
she
bade
you
be
no
longer
a
priest
no
not
then
patiently
replied
the
other
she
was
too
greatly
overwhelmed
with
my
calamity
to
think
of
any
cure
for
it
it
was
that
she
uttered
those
words
words
which
i
shall
never
forget
which
will
support
and
comfort
me
whatever
happens
the
painter
was
biting
hard
upon
the
stem
of
his
pipe
he
turned
away
and
began
ordering
the
and
pencils
on
a
table
against
the
wall
putting
them
close
together
in
very
neat
straight
rows
presently
he
said
perhaps
miss
vervain
also
advised
you
to
go
to
america
yes
answered
the
priest
reverently
she
had
thought
of
everything
she
has
promised
me
a
refuge
under
her
mother
s
roof
there
until
i
can
make
my
inventions
known
and
i
shall
follow
them
at
follow
them
they
are
going
she
told
me
madama
does
not
grow
better
they
are
homesick
they
but
you
must
know
all
this
already
oh
not
at
all
not
at
all
said
the
painter
with
a
very
bitter
smile
you
are
telling
me
news
pray
go
there
is
no
more
she
made
me
promise
to
come
to
you
and
listen
to
your
advice
before
i
took
any
step
i
must
not
trust
to
her
alone
she
said
but
if
i
took
this
step
then
through
whatever
happened
she
would
be
my
friend
ah
dear
friend
may
i
speak
to
you
of
the
hope
that
these
words
gave
me
you
have
seen
have
you
not
you
must
have
seen
that
the
priest
faltered
and
ferris
stared
at
him
helpless
when
the
next
words
came
he
could
not
find
any
strangeness
in
the
fact
which
yet
gave
him
so
great
a
shock
he
found
that
to
his
nether
consciousness
it
had
been
long
familiar
ever
since
that
day
when
he
had
first
jestingly
proposed
don
ippolito
as
miss
vervain
s
teacher
grotesque
tragic
impossible
it
had
still
been
the
of
all
his
reveries
or
so
now
it
seemed
to
have
been
don
ippolito
anxiously
drew
nearer
to
him
and
laid
an
imploring
touch
upon
his
arm
i
love
her
what
gasped
the
painter
you
you
i
a
priest
priest
priest
cried
don
ippolito
violently
from
this
day
i
am
no
longer
a
priest
from
this
hour
i
am
a
man
and
i
can
offer
her
the
honorable
love
of
a
man
the
truth
of
a
most
sacred
marriage
and
fidelity
to
death
ferris
made
no
answer
he
began
to
look
very
coldly
and
haughtily
at
don
ippolito
whose
heat
died
away
under
his
stare
and
who
at
last
met
it
with
a
glance
of
tremulous
perplexity
his
hand
had
dropped
from
ferris
s
arm
and
he
now
moved
some
steps
from
him
what
is
it
dear
friend
he
besought
him
is
there
something
that
offends
you
i
came
to
you
for
counsel
and
you
meet
me
with
a
repulse
little
short
of
enmity
i
do
not
understand
do
i
intend
anything
wrong
without
knowing
it
oh
i
conjure
you
to
speak
plainly
wait
wait
a
minute
said
ferris
waving
his
hand
like
a
man
tormented
by
a
passing
pain
i
am
trying
to
think
what
you
say
is
i
can
not
imagine
it
not
imagine
it
not
imagine
it
and
why
is
she
not
beautiful
and
good
without
and
young
and
yet
wise
beyond
her
years
and
true
and
yet
angelically
kind
it
is
all
as
you
say
god
knows
but
a
priest
oh
always
that
accursed
word
and
at
heart
what
is
a
priest
then
but
a
man
a
wretched
masked
imprisoned
banished
man
has
he
not
blood
and
nerves
like
you
has
he
not
eyes
to
see
what
is
fair
and
ears
to
hear
what
is
sweet
can
he
live
near
so
divine
a
flower
and
not
know
her
grace
not
inhale
the
fragrance
of
her
soul
not
adore
her
beauty
oh
great
god
and
if
at
last
he
would
tear
off
his
stifling
mask
escape
from
his
prison
return
from
his
exile
would
you
gainsay
him
no
said
the
painter
with
a
kind
of
groan
he
sat
down
in
a
tall
carven
gothic
chair
the
furniture
of
one
of
his
pictures
and
rested
his
head
against
its
high
back
and
looked
at
the
priest
across
the
room
excuse
me
he
continued
with
a
strong
effort
i
am
ready
to
befriend
you
to
the
utmost
of
my
power
what
was
it
you
wanted
to
ask
me
i
have
told
you
truly
what
i
thought
of
your
scheme
of
going
to
america
but
i
may
very
well
be
mistaken
was
it
about
that
miss
vervain
desired
you
to
consult
me
his
voice
and
manner
hardened
again
in
spite
of
him
or
did
she
wish
me
to
advise
you
about
the
renunciation
of
your
priesthood
you
must
have
thought
that
carefully
over
for
yes
i
do
not
think
you
could
make
me
see
that
as
a
greater
difficulty
than
it
has
appeared
to
he
paused
with
a
confused
and
daunted
air
as
if
some
important
point
had
slipped
his
mind
but
i
must
take
the
step
the
burden
of
the
double
part
i
play
is
unendurable
is
it
not
you
know
better
than
but
if
you
were
such
a
man
as
i
with
neither
love
for
your
vocation
nor
faith
in
it
should
you
not
cease
to
be
a
priest
if
you
ask
me
in
that
way
yes
answered
the
painter
but
i
advise
you
nothing
i
could
not
counsel
another
in
such
a
but
you
think
and
feel
as
i
do
said
the
priest
and
i
am
right
i
do
not
say
you
are
ferris
was
silent
while
don
ippolito
moved
up
and
down
the
room
with
his
sliding
step
like
some
tall
gaunt
unhappy
girl
neither
could
put
an
end
to
this
interview
so
full
of
intangible
inconclusive
misery
ferris
drew
a
long
breath
and
then
said
steadily
don
ippolito
i
suppose
you
did
not
speak
idly
to
me
of
your
your
feeling
for
miss
vervain
and
that
i
may
speak
plainly
to
you
in
surely
answered
the
priest
pausing
in
his
walk
and
fixing
his
eyes
upon
the
painter
it
was
to
you
as
the
friend
of
both
that
i
spoke
of
my
love
and
my
hope
which
is
oftener
my
then
you
have
not
much
reason
to
believe
that
she
returns
your
feeling
ah
how
could
she
consciously
return
it
i
have
been
hitherto
a
priest
to
her
and
the
thought
of
me
would
have
been
impurity
but
hereafter
if
i
can
prove
myself
a
man
if
i
can
win
my
place
in
the
world
no
even
now
why
should
she
care
so
much
for
my
escape
from
these
bonds
if
she
did
not
care
for
me
more
than
she
knew
have
you
ever
thought
of
that
extravagant
generosity
of
miss
vervain
s
character
it
is
divine
has
it
seemed
to
you
that
if
such
a
woman
knew
herself
to
have
once
wrongly
given
you
pain
her
atonement
might
be
as
headlong
and
excessive
as
her
offense
that
she
could
have
no
reserves
in
her
reparation
don
ippolito
looked
at
ferris
but
did
not
interpose
miss
vervain
is
very
religious
in
her
way
and
she
is
truth
itself
are
you
sure
that
it
is
not
concern
for
what
seems
to
her
your
terrible
position
that
has
made
her
show
so
much
anxiety
on
your
account
do
i
not
know
that
well
have
i
not
felt
the
balm
of
her
most
heavenly
pity
and
may
she
not
be
only
trying
to
appeal
to
something
in
you
as
high
as
the
impulse
of
her
own
heart
as
high
cried
don
ippolito
almost
angrily
can
there
be
any
higher
thing
in
heaven
or
on
earth
than
love
for
such
a
woman
yes
both
in
heaven
and
on
earth
answered
ferris
i
do
not
understand
you
said
don
ippolito
with
a
puzzled
stare
ferris
did
not
reply
he
fell
into
a
dull
reverie
in
which
he
seemed
to
forget
don
ippolito
and
the
whole
affair
at
last
the
priest
spoke
again
have
you
nothing
to
say
to
me
signore
i
what
is
there
to
say
returned
the
other
blankly
do
you
know
any
reason
why
i
should
not
love
her
save
that
i
am
have
been
a
priest
no
i
know
none
said
the
painter
wearily
ah
exclaimed
don
ippolito
there
is
something
on
your
mind
that
you
will
not
speak
i
beseech
you
not
to
let
me
go
wrong
i
love
her
so
well
that
i
would
rather
die
than
let
my
love
offend
her
i
am
a
man
with
the
passions
and
hopes
of
a
man
but
without
a
man
s
experience
or
a
man
s
knowledge
of
what
is
just
and
right
in
these
relations
if
you
can
be
my
friend
in
this
so
far
as
to
advise
or
warn
me
if
you
can
be
her
friend
ferris
abruptly
rose
and
went
to
his
balcony
and
looked
out
upon
the
grand
canal
the
palace
opposite
had
not
changed
in
the
last
as
on
many
another
summer
day
he
saw
the
black
boats
going
by
a
heavy
barge
from
the
sile
with
the
captain
s
family
at
dinner
in
the
shade
of
a
matting
on
the
roof
moved
sluggishly
down
the
middle
current
a
party
of
americans
in
a
gondola
with
their
and
in
their
hands
pointed
out
to
each
other
the
eagle
on
the
consular
arms
they
were
all
like
sights
in
a
mirror
or
things
in
a
world
turned
upside
down
ferris
came
back
and
looked
dizzily
at
the
priest
trying
to
believe
that
this
unhuman
sacerdotal
phantasm
had
been
telling
him
that
it
loved
a
beautiful
young
girl
of
his
own
race
faith
and
language
will
you
not
answer
me
signore
meekly
demanded
don
ippolito
in
this
matter
replied
the
painter
i
can
not
advise
or
warn
you
the
whole
affair
is
beyond
my
conception
i
mean
no
unkindness
but
i
can
not
consult
with
you
about
it
there
are
reasons
why
i
should
not
the
mother
of
miss
vervain
is
here
with
her
and
i
do
not
feel
that
her
interests
in
such
a
matter
are
in
my
hands
if
they
come
to
me
for
help
that
is
different
what
do
you
wish
you
tell
me
that
you
are
resolved
to
renounce
the
priesthood
and
go
to
america
and
i
have
answered
you
to
the
best
of
my
power
you
tell
me
that
you
are
in
love
with
miss
vervain
what
can
i
have
to
say
about
that
don
ippolito
stood
listening
with
a
patient
and
then
a
wounded
air
nothing
he
answered
proudly
i
ask
your
pardon
for
troubling
you
with
my
affairs
your
former
kindness
emboldened
me
too
much
i
shall
not
trespass
again
it
was
my
ignorance
which
i
pray
you
to
excuse
i
take
my
leave
he
bowed
and
moved
out
of
the
room
and
a
dull
remorse
filled
the
painter
as
he
heard
the
outer
door
close
after
him
but
he
could
do
nothing
if
he
had
given
a
wound
to
the
heart
that
trusted
him
it
was
in
an
anguish
which
he
had
not
been
able
to
master
and
whose
causes
he
could
not
yet
define
it
was
all
a
shapeless
torment
it
held
him
like
the
memory
of
some
hideous
nightmare
prolonging
its
horror
beyond
sleep
it
seemed
impossible
that
what
had
happened
should
have
happened
it
was
long
as
he
sat
in
the
chair
from
which
he
had
talked
with
don
ippolito
before
he
could
reason
about
what
had
been
said
and
then
the
worst
phase
presented
itself
first
he
could
not
help
seeing
that
the
priest
might
have
found
cause
for
hope
in
the
girl
s
behavior
toward
him
her
violent
resentments
and
her
equally
violent
repentances
her
fervent
interest
in
his
unhappy
fortunes
and
her
anxiety
that
he
should
at
once
forsake
the
priesthood
her
urging
him
to
go
to
america
and
her
promising
him
a
home
under
her
mother
s
roof
there
why
might
it
not
all
be
in
fact
a
proof
of
her
tenderness
for
him
she
might
have
found
it
necessary
to
be
thus
coarsely
explicit
with
him
for
a
man
in
don
ippolito
s
relation
to
her
could
not
otherwise
have
imagined
her
interest
in
him
but
her
making
use
of
ferris
to
confirm
her
own
purposes
by
his
words
her
repeating
them
so
that
they
should
come
back
to
him
from
don
ippolito
s
lips
her
letting
another
man
go
with
her
to
look
upon
the
procession
in
which
her
priestly
lover
was
to
appear
in
his
sacerdotal
panoply
these
things
could
not
be
accounted
for
except
by
that
strain
of
insolent
passionate
defiance
which
he
had
noted
ill
her
from
the
beginning
why
should
she
first
tell
don
ippolito
of
their
going
away
well
i
wish
him
joy
of
his
bargain
said
ferris
aloud
and
rising
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
tried
to
cast
off
all
care
of
a
matter
that
did
not
concern
him
but
one
does
not
so
easily
cast
off
a
matter
that
does
not
concern
one
he
found
himself
haunted
by
certain
tones
and
looks
and
attitudes
of
the
young
girl
wholly
alien
to
the
character
he
had
just
constructed
for
her
they
were
trusting
unconscious
far
beyond
anything
he
had
yet
known
in
women
and
they
appealed
to
him
now
with
a
maddening
pathos
she
was
standing
there
before
don
ippolito
s
picture
as
on
that
morning
when
she
came
to
ferris
looking
anxiously
at
him
her
innocent
beauty
troubled
with
some
hidden
care
hallowing
the
place
ferris
thought
of
the
young
fellow
who
told
him
that
he
had
spent
three
months
in
a
dull
german
town
because
he
had
the
room
there
that
was
once
occupied
by
the
girl
who
had
refused
him
the
painter
remembered
that
the
young
fellow
said
he
had
just
read
of
her
marriage
in
an
american
newspaper
why
did
miss
vervain
send
don
ippolito
to
him
was
it
some
scheme
of
her
secret
love
for
the
priest
or
mere
coarse
resentment
of
the
cautions
ferris
had
once
hinted
a
piece
of
vulgar
bravado
but
if
she
had
acted
throughout
in
pure
simplicity
in
unwise
goodness
of
heart
if
don
ippolito
were
altogether
and
nothing
but
her
unknowing
pity
had
given
him
grounds
of
hope
he
himself
had
suggested
this
to
the
priest
and
how
with
a
different
motive
he
looked
at
it
in
his
own
behalf
a
great
load
began
slowly
to
lift
itself
from
ferris
s
heart
which
could
ache
now
for
this
most
unhappy
priest
but
if
his
conjecture
were
just
his
duty
would
be
different
he
must
not
coldly
acquiesce
and
let
things
take
their
course
he
had
introduced
don
ippolito
to
the
vervains
he
was
in
some
sort
responsible
for
him
he
must
save
them
if
possible
from
the
painful
consequences
of
the
priest
s
hallucination
but
how
to
do
this
was
by
no
means
clear
he
blamed
himself
for
not
having
been
franker
with
don
ippolito
and
tried
to
make
him
see
that
the
vervains
might
regard
his
passion
as
a
presumption
upon
their
kindness
to
him
an
abuse
of
their
hospitable
friendship
and
yet
how
could
he
have
done
this
without
outrage
to
a
sensitive
and
soul
for
a
moment
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
must
seek
don
ippolito
and
repair
his
fault
but
they
had
hardly
parted
as
friends
and
his
action
might
be
easily
misconstrued
if
he
shrank
from
the
thought
of
speaking
to
him
of
the
matter
again
it
appeared
yet
more
impossible
to
bring
it
before
the
vervains
like
a
man
of
the
imaginative
temperament
as
he
was
he
exaggerated
the
probable
effect
and
pictured
their
dismay
in
colors
that
made
his
interference
seem
a
ludicrous
enormity
in
fact
it
would
have
been
an
awkward
business
enough
for
one
not
hampered
by
his
intricate
obligations
he
felt
bound
to
the
vervains
the
ignorant
young
girl
and
the
mother
but
if
he
ought
to
go
to
them
and
tell
them
what
he
knew
to
which
of
them
ought
he
to
speak
and
how
in
an
anguish
of
perplexity
that
made
the
sweat
stand
in
drops
upon
his
forehead
he
smiled
to
think
it
just
possible
that
vervain
might
take
the
matter
seriously
and
wish
to
consider
the
propriety
of
florida
s
accepting
don
ippolito
but
if
he
spoke
to
the
daughter
how
should
he
approach
the
subject
don
ippolito
tells
me
he
loves
you
and
he
goes
to
america
with
the
expectation
that
when
he
has
made
his
fortune
with
a
patent
you
will
marry
should
he
say
something
to
this
purport
and
in
heaven
s
name
what
right
had
he
ferris
to
say
anything
at
all
the
horrible
absurdity
the
inexorable
delicacy
of
his
position
made
him
laugh
on
the
other
hand
besides
he
was
bound
to
don
ippolito
who
had
come
to
him
as
the
nearest
friend
of
both
and
confided
in
him
he
remembered
with
a
tardy
poignant
intelligence
how
in
their
first
talk
of
the
vervains
don
ippolito
had
taken
pains
to
inform
himself
that
ferris
was
not
in
love
with
florida
could
he
be
less
manly
and
generous
than
this
poor
priest
and
violate
the
sanctity
of
his
confidence
ferris
groaned
aloud
no
contrive
it
as
he
would
call
it
by
what
fair
name
he
chose
he
could
not
commit
this
treachery
it
was
the
more
impossible
to
him
because
in
this
agony
of
doubt
as
to
what
he
should
do
he
now
at
least
read
his
own
heart
clearly
and
had
no
longer
a
doubt
what
was
in
it
he
pitied
her
for
the
pain
she
must
suffer
he
saw
how
her
simple
goodness
her
blind
sympathy
with
don
ippolito
and
only
this
must
have
led
the
priest
to
the
mistaken
pass
at
which
he
stood
but
ferris
felt
that
the
whole
affair
had
been
fatally
carried
beyond
his
reach
he
could
do
nothing
now
but
wait
and
endure
there
are
cases
in
which
a
man
must
not
protect
the
woman
he
loves
this
was
one
the
afternoon
wore
away
in
the
evening
he
went
to
the
piazza
and
drank
a
cup
of
coffee
at
florian
s
then
he
walked
to
the
public
gardens
where
he
watched
the
crowd
till
it
thinned
in
the
twilight
and
left
him
alone
he
hung
upon
the
parapet
looking
off
over
the
lagoon
that
at
last
he
perceived
to
be
flooded
with
moonlight
he
desperately
called
a
gondola
and
bade
the
man
row
him
to
the
public
landing
nearest
the
vervains
and
so
walked
up
the
calle
and
entered
the
palace
from
the
campo
through
the
court
that
on
one
side
opened
into
the
garden
vervain
was
alone
in
the
room
where
he
had
always
been
accustomed
to
find
her
daughter
with
her
and
a
chill
as
of
the
impending
change
fell
upon
him
he
felt
how
pleasant
it
had
been
to
find
them
together
with
a
vain
piercing
regret
he
felt
how
much
like
home
the
place
had
been
to
him
vervain
indeed
was
not
changed
she
was
even
more
than
ever
herself
though
all
that
she
said
imported
change
she
seemed
to
observe
nothing
unwonted
in
him
and
she
began
to
talk
in
her
way
of
things
that
she
could
not
know
were
so
near
his
heart
now
ferris
i
have
a
little
surprise
for
you
guess
what
it
is
i
m
not
good
at
guessing
i
d
rather
not
know
what
it
is
than
have
to
guess
it
said
ferris
trying
to
be
light
under
his
heavy
trouble
you
won
t
try
once
even
well
you
re
going
to
be
rid
of
us
soon
i
we
are
going
yes
i
knew
that
said
ferris
quietly
don
ippolito
told
me
so
and
is
that
all
you
have
to
say
isn
t
it
rather
sad
isn
t
it
sudden
come
ferris
do
be
a
little
complimentary
for
once
it
s
sudden
and
i
can
assure
you
it
s
sad
enough
for
me
replied
the
painter
in
a
tone
which
could
not
leave
any
doubt
of
his
sincerity
well
so
it
is
for
us
quavered
vervain
you
have
been
very
very
good
to
us
she
went
on
more
collectedly
and
we
shall
never
forget
it
florida
has
been
speaking
of
it
too
and
she
s
extremely
grateful
and
thinks
we
ve
quite
imposed
upon
i
suppose
we
have
but
as
i
always
say
you
re
the
representative
of
the
country
here
however
that
s
neither
here
nor
there
we
have
no
relatives
on
the
face
of
the
earth
you
know
but
i
have
a
good
many
old
friends
in
providence
and
we
re
going
back
there
we
both
think
i
shall
be
better
at
home
for
i
m
sorry
to
say
mr
ferns
that
though
i
don
t
complain
of
venice
it
s
really
a
beautiful
place
and
all
that
not
the
least
exaggerated
still
i
don
t
think
it
s
done
my
health
much
good
or
at
least
i
don
t
seem
to
gain
don
t
you
know
i
don
t
seem
to
i
m
very
sorry
to
hear
it
yes
i
m
sure
you
are
but
you
see
don
t
you
that
we
must
go
we
are
going
next
week
when
we
ve
once
made
up
our
minds
there
s
no
object
in
prolonging
the
vervain
adjusted
her
glasses
with
the
thumb
and
finger
of
her
right
hand
and
peered
into
ferris
s
face
with
a
gay
smile
but
the
greatest
part
of
the
surprise
is
she
resumed
lowering
her
voice
a
little
that
don
ippolito
is
going
with
ah
cried
ferris
sharply
i
i
should
surprise
you
laughed
vervain
we
ve
been
having
a
regular
confab
i
mean
about
it
here
and
he
s
all
on
fire
to
go
to
america
though
it
must
be
kept
a
great
secret
on
his
account
poor
fellow
he
s
to
join
us
in
france
and
then
he
can
easily
get
into
england
with
us
you
know
he
s
to
give
up
being
a
priest
and
is
going
to
devote
himself
to
invention
when
he
gets
to
america
now
what
you
think
of
it
ferris
quite
strikes
you
dumb
doesn
t
it
triumphed
vervain
i
suppose
it
s
what
you
would
call
a
wild
goose
chase
i
used
to
pick
up
all
those
phrases
but
we
shall
carry
it
ferris
gasped
as
though
about
to
speak
but
said
nothing
don
ippolito
s
been
here
the
whole
afternoon
continued
vervain
or
rather
ever
since
about
five
o
clock
he
took
dinner
with
us
and
we
ve
been
talking
it
over
and
over
he
s
enthusiastic
about
it
and
yet
he
breaks
down
every
little
while
and
seems
quite
to
despair
of
the
undertaking
but
florida
won
t
let
him
do
that
and
really
it
s
funny
the
way
he
defers
to
her
judgment
you
know
always
regard
florida
as
such
a
mere
child
and
seems
to
take
every
word
she
says
for
gospel
but
shedding
tears
now
it
s
dreadful
in
a
man
isn
t
it
i
wish
don
ippolito
wouldn
t
do
that
it
makes
one
creep
i
can
t
feel
that
it
s
manly
can
you
ferris
found
voice
to
say
something
about
those
things
being
different
with
the
latin
races
well
at
any
rate
said
vervain
i
m
glad
that
don
t
shed
tears
as
a
general
now
florida
you
d
think
she
was
the
man
all
through
this
business
she
s
so
perfectly
heroic
about
it
that
is
outwardly
for
i
can
see
women
can
in
each
other
ferris
just
where
she
s
on
the
point
of
breaking
down
all
the
while
has
she
ever
spoken
to
you
about
don
ippolito
she
does
think
so
highly
of
your
opinion
she
does
me
too
much
honor
said
ferris
with
ghastly
irony
oh
i
don
t
think
so
returned
vervain
she
told
me
this
morning
that
she
d
made
don
ippolito
promise
to
speak
to
you
about
it
but
he
didn
t
mention
having
done
so
and
i
hated
don
t
you
know
to
ask
him
in
fact
florida
had
told
me
beforehand
that
i
mustn
t
she
said
he
must
be
left
entirely
to
himself
in
that
matter
and
vervain
looked
suggestively
at
ferris
he
spoke
to
me
about
it
said
ferris
then
why
in
the
world
did
you
let
me
run
on
i
suppose
you
advised
him
against
i
certainly
well
there
s
where
i
think
woman
s
intuition
is
better
than
man
s
the
painter
silently
bowed
his
head
yes
i
m
quite
woman
s
rights
in
that
respect
said
vervain
oh
without
doubt
answered
ferris
aimlessly
i
m
perfectly
delighted
she
went
on
at
the
idea
of
don
ippolito
s
giving
up
the
priesthood
and
i
ve
told
him
he
must
get
married
to
some
good
american
girl
you
ought
to
have
seen
how
the
poor
fellow
blushed
but
really
you
know
there
are
lots
of
nice
girls
that
would
at
him
so
handsome
and
and
a
ferris
could
only
stare
helplessly
at
vervain
who
continued
yes
i
think
he
s
a
genius
and
i
m
determined
that
he
shall
have
a
chance
i
suppose
we
ve
got
a
job
on
our
hands
but
i
m
not
sorry
i
ll
introduce
him
into
society
and
if
he
needs
money
he
shall
have
it
what
does
god
give
us
money
for
ferris
but
to
help
our
so
miserable
as
he
was
from
head
to
foot
that
it
seemed
impossible
he
could
endure
more
ferris
could
not
forbear
laughing
at
this
burst
of
piety
what
are
you
laughing
at
asked
vervain
who
had
cheerfully
joined
him
something
i
ve
been
saying
well
you
won
t
have
me
to
laugh
at
much
longer
i
do
wonder
whom
you
ll
have
ferris
s
merriment
died
away
in
something
like
a
groan
and
when
vervain
again
spoke
it
was
in
a
tone
of
sudden
querulousness
i
florida
would
come
she
went
to
bolt
the
after
don
ippolito
i
wanted
her
to
but
she
ought
to
have
been
back
long
ago
it
s
odd
you
didn
t
meet
them
coming
in
she
must
be
in
the
garden
somewhere
i
suppose
she
s
sorry
to
be
leaving
it
but
i
need
her
would
you
be
so
very
kind
ferris
as
to
go
and
ask
her
to
come
to
me
ferris
rose
heavily
from
the
chair
in
which
he
seemed
to
have
grown
ten
years
older
he
had
hardly
heard
anything
that
he
did
not
know
already
but
the
clear
vision
of
the
affair
with
which
he
had
come
to
the
vervains
was
hopelessly
confused
and
darkened
he
could
make
nothing
of
any
phase
of
it
he
did
not
know
whether
he
cared
now
to
see
florida
or
not
he
mechanically
obeyed
vervain
and
stepping
out
upon
the
terrace
slowly
descended
the
stairway
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
into
the
garden
xv
florida
and
don
ippolito
had
paused
in
the
pathway
which
parted
at
the
fountain
and
led
in
one
direction
to
the
and
in
the
other
out
through
the
into
the
campo
now
you
must
not
give
way
to
despair
again
she
said
to
him
you
will
succeed
i
am
sure
for
you
will
deserve
it
is
all
your
goodness
madamigella
sighed
the
priest
and
at
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
am
afraid
that
all
the
hope
and
courage
i
have
are
also
you
shall
never
want
for
hope
and
courage
then
we
believe
in
you
and
we
honor
your
purpose
and
we
will
be
your
steadfast
friends
but
now
you
must
think
only
of
the
present
of
how
you
are
to
get
away
from
venice
oh
i
can
understand
how
you
must
hate
to
leave
it
what
a
beautiful
night
you
mustn
t
expect
such
moonlight
as
this
in
america
don
it
beautiful
is
it
not
said
the
priest
kindling
from
her
but
i
think
we
venetians
are
never
so
conscious
of
the
beauty
of
venice
as
you
strangers
i
don
t
know
i
only
know
that
now
since
we
have
made
up
our
minds
to
go
and
fixed
the
day
and
hour
it
is
more
like
leaving
my
own
country
than
anything
else
i
ve
ever
felt
this
garden
i
seem
to
have
spent
my
whole
life
in
it
and
when
we
are
settled
in
providence
i
m
going
to
have
mother
send
back
for
some
of
these
statues
i
suppose
signor
cavaletti
wouldn
t
mind
our
robbing
his
place
of
them
if
he
were
paid
enough
at
any
rate
we
must
have
this
one
that
belongs
to
the
fountain
you
shall
be
the
first
to
set
the
fountain
playing
over
there
don
ippolito
and
then
we
ll
sit
down
on
this
stone
bench
before
it
and
imagine
ourselves
in
the
garden
of
casa
vervain
at
no
no
let
me
be
the
last
to
set
it
playing
here
said
the
priest
quickly
stooping
to
the
pipe
at
the
foot
of
the
figure
and
then
we
will
sit
down
here
and
imagine
ourselves
in
the
garden
of
casa
vervain
at
florida
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
you
mustn
t
do
it
she
said
simply
the
padrone
doesn
t
like
to
waste
the
oh
we
ll
pray
the
saints
to
rain
it
back
on
him
some
day
cried
don
ippolito
with
willful
levity
and
the
stream
leaped
into
the
moonlight
and
seemed
to
hang
there
like
a
tangled
skein
of
silver
but
how
shall
i
shut
it
off
when
you
are
gone
asked
the
young
girl
looking
ruefully
at
the
floating
threads
of
splendor
oh
i
will
shut
it
off
before
i
go
answered
don
ippolito
let
it
play
a
moment
he
continued
gazing
rapturously
upon
it
while
the
moon
painted
his
lifted
face
with
a
pallor
that
his
black
robes
heightened
he
fetched
a
long
sighing
breath
as
if
he
inhaled
with
that
respiration
all
the
rich
odors
of
the
flowers
blanched
like
his
own
visage
in
the
white
lustre
as
if
he
absorbed
into
his
heart
at
once
the
wide
glory
of
the
summer
night
and
the
beauty
of
the
young
girl
at
his
side
it
seemed
a
supreme
moment
with
him
he
looked
as
a
man
might
look
who
has
climbed
out
of
lifelong
defeat
into
a
single
instant
of
release
and
triumph
florida
sank
upon
the
bench
before
the
fountain
indulging
his
caprice
with
that
sacred
motherly
tolerance
some
touch
of
which
is
in
all
womanly
yielding
to
men
s
will
and
which
was
perhaps
present
in
greater
degree
in
her
feeling
towards
a
man
more
than
ordinarily
orphaned
and
unfriended
is
providence
your
native
city
asked
don
ippolito
abruptly
after
a
little
silence
oh
no
i
was
born
at
augustine
in
ah
yes
i
forgot
madama
has
told
me
about
it
providence
is
city
but
the
two
are
near
together
no
said
florida
compassionately
they
are
a
thousand
miles
a
thousand
miles
what
a
vast
country
yes
it
s
a
whole
ah
a
world
indeed
cried
the
priest
softly
i
shall
never
comprehend
you
never
will
answered
the
young
girl
gravely
if
you
do
not
think
about
it
more
practically
practically
lightly
retorted
the
priest
what
a
word
with
you
americans
that
is
the
consul
s
word
then
you
have
been
to
see
him
asked
florida
with
eagerness
i
wanted
to
ask
you
yes
i
went
to
consult
the
oracle
as
you
bade
don
ippolito
and
he
was
averse
to
my
going
to
america
he
said
it
was
not
oh
murmured
the
girl
i
think
continued
the
priest
with
vehemence
that
signor
ferris
is
no
longer
my
did
he
treat
you
coldly
harshly
she
asked
with
a
note
of
indignation
in
her
voice
did
he
know
that
i
that
you
came
perhaps
he
was
right
perhaps
i
shall
indeed
go
to
ruin
there
ruin
ruin
do
i
not
ruin
here
what
did
he
say
what
did
he
tell
you
no
no
not
now
madamigella
i
do
not
want
to
think
of
that
man
now
i
want
you
to
help
me
once
more
to
realize
myself
in
america
where
i
shall
never
have
been
a
priest
where
i
shall
at
least
battle
with
the
world
come
let
us
forget
him
the
thought
of
him
palsies
all
my
hope
he
could
not
see
me
save
in
this
robe
in
this
figure
that
i
oh
it
was
strange
it
was
not
like
him
it
was
cruel
what
did
he
say
in
everything
but
words
he
bade
me
despair
he
bade
me
look
upon
all
that
makes
life
dear
and
noble
as
impossible
to
me
oh
how
perhaps
he
did
not
understand
you
no
he
did
not
understand
you
what
did
you
say
to
him
don
ippolito
tell
me
she
leaned
towards
him
in
anxious
emotion
as
she
spoke
the
priest
rose
and
stretched
out
his
arms
as
if
he
would
gather
something
of
courage
from
the
infinite
space
in
his
visage
were
the
sublimity
and
the
terror
of
a
man
who
puts
everything
to
the
risk
how
will
it
really
be
with
me
yonder
he
demanded
as
it
is
with
other
men
whom
their
past
life
if
it
has
been
guiltless
does
not
follow
to
that
new
world
of
freedom
and
justice
why
should
it
not
be
so
demanded
florida
did
say
it
would
not
need
it
be
known
there
that
i
have
been
a
priest
or
if
i
tell
it
will
it
make
me
appear
a
kind
of
monster
different
from
other
men
no
no
she
answered
fervently
your
story
would
gain
friends
and
honor
for
you
everywhere
in
america
did
a
moment
a
moment
cried
don
ippolito
catching
his
breath
will
it
ever
be
possible
for
me
to
win
something
more
than
honor
and
friendship
there
she
looked
up
at
him
askingly
confusedly
if
i
am
a
man
and
the
time
should
ever
come
that
a
face
a
look
a
voice
shall
be
to
me
what
they
are
to
other
men
will
remember
it
against
me
that
i
have
been
a
priest
when
i
tell
her
say
to
her
madamigella
how
dear
she
is
to
me
offer
her
my
life
s
devotion
ask
her
to
be
my
wife
florida
rose
from
the
seat
and
stood
confronting
him
in
a
helpless
silence
which
he
seemed
not
to
notice
suddenly
he
clasped
his
hands
together
and
desperately
stretched
them
towards
her
oh
my
hope
my
trust
my
life
if
it
were
you
that
i
loved
what
shuddered
the
girl
recoiling
with
almost
a
shriek
don
ippolito
gave
a
low
cry
half
sob
his
words
his
words
it
is
true
i
can
not
escape
i
am
doomed
i
must
die
as
i
have
lived
he
dropped
his
face
into
his
hands
and
stood
with
his
head
bowed
before
her
neither
spoke
for
a
long
time
or
moved
then
florida
said
absently
in
the
husky
murmur
to
which
her
voice
fell
when
she
was
strongly
moved
yes
i
see
it
all
how
it
has
been
and
was
silent
again
staring
as
if
a
procession
of
the
events
and
scenes
of
the
past
months
were
passing
before
her
and
presently
she
moaned
to
herself
oh
oh
oh
and
wrung
her
hands
the
foolish
fountain
kept
capering
and
babbling
on
all
at
once
now
as
a
flame
flashes
up
and
then
expires
it
leaped
and
dropped
extinct
at
the
foot
of
the
statue
its
going
out
seemed
somehow
to
leave
them
in
darkness
and
under
cover
of
that
gloom
she
drew
nearer
the
priest
and
by
such
approaches
as
one
makes
toward
a
fancied
apparition
when
his
fear
will
not
let
him
fly
but
it
seems
better
to
suffer
the
worst
from
it
at
once
than
to
live
in
terror
of
it
ever
after
she
lifted
her
hands
to
his
and
gently
taking
them
away
from
his
face
looked
into
his
hopeless
eyes
oh
don
ippolito
she
grieved
what
shall
i
say
to
you
what
can
i
do
for
you
now
but
there
was
nothing
to
do
the
whole
edifice
of
his
dreams
his
wild
imaginations
had
fallen
into
dust
at
a
word
no
magic
could
rebuild
it
the
end
that
never
seems
the
end
had
come
he
let
her
keep
his
cold
hands
and
presently
he
returned
the
entreaty
of
her
tears
with
his
wan
patient
smile
you
can
not
help
me
there
is
no
help
for
an
error
like
mine
sometime
if
ever
the
thought
of
me
is
a
greater
pain
than
it
is
at
this
moment
you
can
forgive
me
yes
you
can
do
that
for
but
who
will
ever
forgive
me
she
cried
for
my
blindness
oh
you
must
believe
that
i
never
thought
i
never
dreamt
i
know
it
well
it
was
your
fatal
truth
that
did
it
truth
too
high
and
fine
for
me
to
have
discerned
save
through
such
agony
as
you
too
loved
my
soul
like
the
rest
and
you
would
have
had
me
no
priest
for
the
reason
that
they
would
have
had
me
a
priest
i
see
it
but
you
had
no
right
to
love
my
soul
and
not
me
you
a
woman
a
woman
must
not
love
only
the
soul
of
a
yes
yes
piteously
explained
the
girl
but
you
were
a
priest
to
me
that
is
true
madamigella
i
was
always
a
priest
to
you
and
now
i
see
that
i
never
could
be
otherwise
ah
the
wrong
began
many
years
before
we
met
i
was
trying
to
blame
you
a
little
blame
me
blame
me
do
but
there
is
no
blame
think
that
it
was
another
way
of
asking
your
forgiveness
o
my
god
my
god
my
god
he
released
his
hands
from
her
and
uttered
this
cry
under
his
breath
with
his
face
lifted
towards
the
heavens
when
he
looked
at
her
again
he
said
madamigella
if
my
share
of
this
misery
gives
me
the
right
to
ask
of
you
oh
ask
anything
of
me
i
will
give
everything
do
everything
he
faltered
and
then
you
do
not
love
me
he
said
abruptly
is
there
some
one
else
that
you
love
she
did
not
answer
is
it
he
she
hid
her
face
i
knew
it
groaned
the
priest
i
knew
that
too
and
he
turned
away
don
ippolito
don
ippolito
oh
poor
poor
don
ippolito
cried
the
girl
springing
towards
him
is
the
way
you
leave
me
where
are
you
going
what
will
you
do
now
did
i
not
say
i
am
going
to
die
a
is
there
nothing
that
you
will
let
me
be
to
you
hope
for
you
nothing
said
don
ippolito
after
a
moment
what
could
you
he
seized
the
hands
imploringly
extended
towards
him
and
clasped
them
together
and
kissed
them
both
adieu
he
whispered
then
he
opened
them
and
passionately
kissed
either
palm
adieu
adieu
a
great
wave
of
sorrow
and
compassion
and
despair
for
him
swept
through
her
she
flung
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
pulled
his
head
down
upon
her
heart
and
held
it
tight
there
weeping
and
moaning
over
him
as
over
some
hapless
harmless
thing
that
she
had
unpurposely
bruised
or
killed
then
she
suddenly
put
her
hands
against
his
breast
and
thrust
him
away
and
turned
and
ran
ferris
stepped
back
again
into
the
shadow
of
the
tree
from
which
he
had
just
emerged
and
clung
to
its
trunk
lest
he
should
fall
another
seemed
to
creep
out
of
the
court
in
his
person
and
totter
across
the
white
glare
of
the
campo
and
down
the
blackness
of
the
calle
in
the
intersected
spaces
where
the
moonlight
fell
this
alien
miserable
man
saw
the
figure
of
a
priest
gliding
on
before
him
xvi
florida
swiftly
mounted
the
terrace
steps
but
she
stopped
with
her
hand
on
the
door
panting
and
turned
and
walked
slowly
away
to
the
end
of
the
terrace
drying
her
eyes
with
dashes
of
her
handkerchief
and
ordering
her
hair
some
coils
of
which
had
been
loosened
by
her
flight
then
she
went
back
to
the
door
waited
and
softly
opened
it
her
mother
was
not
in
the
parlor
where
she
had
left
her
and
she
passed
noiselessly
into
her
own
room
where
some
trunks
stood
open
and
against
the
wall
she
began
to
gather
up
the
pieces
of
dress
that
lay
upon
the
bed
and
chairs
and
to
fold
them
with
mechanical
carefulness
and
put
them
in
the
boxes
her
mother
s
voice
called
from
the
other
chamber
is
that
you
florida
yes
mother
answered
the
girl
but
remained
kneeling
before
one
of
the
boxes
with
that
pale
green
robe
in
her
hand
which
she
had
worn
on
the
morning
when
ferris
had
first
brought
don
ippolito
to
see
them
she
smoothed
its
folds
and
looked
down
at
it
without
making
any
motion
to
pack
it
away
and
so
she
lingered
while
her
mother
advanced
with
one
question
after
another
what
are
you
doing
florida
where
are
you
why
didn
t
you
come
to
me
and
finally
stood
in
the
doorway
oh
you
re
packing
do
you
know
florida
i
m
getting
very
impatient
about
going
i
wish
we
could
be
off
at
a
tremor
passed
over
the
young
girl
and
she
started
from
her
languid
posture
and
laid
the
dress
in
the
trunk
so
do
i
mother
i
would
give
the
world
if
we
could
go
yes
but
we
can
t
you
see
i
m
afraid
we
ve
undertaken
a
great
deal
my
dear
it
s
quite
a
weight
upon
mind
already
and
i
don
t
know
what
it
be
if
we
were
free
now
i
should
say
go
by
all
means
but
we
couldn
t
arrange
it
with
don
ippolito
on
our
florida
waited
a
moment
before
she
replied
then
she
said
coldly
don
ippolito
is
not
going
with
us
not
going
with
us
why
he
is
not
going
to
america
he
will
not
leave
venice
he
is
to
remain
a
priest
said
florida
doggedly
vervain
sat
down
in
the
chair
that
stood
beside
the
door
not
going
to
america
not
leave
venice
remain
a
priest
florida
you
astonish
me
but
i
am
not
the
least
surprised
not
the
least
in
the
world
i
thought
don
ippolito
would
give
out
all
along
he
is
not
what
i
should
call
fickle
exactly
but
he
is
weak
or
timid
rather
he
is
a
good
man
but
he
lacks
courage
resolution
i
always
doubted
if
he
would
succeed
in
america
he
is
too
much
of
a
dreamer
but
this
really
goes
a
little
beyond
anything
i
never
expected
this
what
did
he
say
florida
how
did
he
excuse
himself
i
hardly
know
very
little
what
was
there
to
say
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
did
you
try
to
reason
with
him
florida
no
answered
the
girl
drearily
i
am
glad
of
that
i
think
you
had
said
quite
enough
already
you
owed
it
to
yourself
not
to
do
so
and
he
might
have
misinterpreted
it
these
foreigners
are
very
different
from
americans
no
doubt
we
should
have
had
a
time
of
it
if
he
had
gone
with
us
it
must
be
for
the
best
i
m
sure
it
was
ordered
so
but
all
that
doesn
t
relieve
don
ippolito
from
the
charge
of
black
ingratitude
and
want
of
consideration
for
us
he
s
quite
made
fools
of
he
was
not
to
blame
it
was
a
very
great
step
for
him
and
if
i
know
that
but
he
ought
not
to
have
talked
of
it
he
ought
to
have
known
his
own
mind
fully
before
speaking
that
s
the
only
safe
way
well
then
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
our
going
florida
drew
a
long
breath
and
rose
to
go
on
with
the
work
of
packing
have
you
been
crying
florida
well
of
course
you
can
t
help
feeling
sorry
for
such
a
man
there
s
a
great
deal
of
good
in
don
ippolito
a
great
deal
but
when
you
come
to
my
age
you
won
t
cry
so
easily
my
dear
it
s
very
trying
said
vervain
she
sat
awhile
in
silence
before
she
asked
will
he
come
here
morning
her
daughter
looked
at
her
with
a
glance
of
terrified
inquiry
do
have
your
wits
about
you
my
dear
we
can
t
go
away
without
saying
to
him
and
we
can
t
go
away
without
paying
paying
him
yes
paying
him
paying
him
for
your
lessons
it
s
always
been
very
awkward
he
hasn
t
been
like
other
teachers
you
know
more
like
a
guest
or
friend
of
the
family
he
never
seemed
to
want
to
take
the
money
and
of
late
i
ve
been
letting
it
run
along
because
i
hated
so
to
offer
it
till
now
it
s
quite
a
sum
i
suppose
he
needs
it
poor
fellow
and
how
to
get
it
to
him
is
the
question
he
may
not
come
as
usual
and
i
couldn
t
trust
it
to
the
padrone
we
might
send
it
to
him
in
a
draft
from
paris
but
i
d
rather
pay
him
before
we
go
besides
it
would
be
rather
rude
going
away
without
seeing
him
vervain
thought
a
moment
then
i
ll
tell
you
she
resumed
if
he
doesn
t
happen
to
come
here
morning
we
can
stop
on
our
way
to
the
station
and
give
him
the
florida
did
not
answer
don
t
you
think
that
would
be
a
good
plan
i
don
t
know
replied
the
girl
in
a
dull
way
why
florida
if
you
think
from
anything
don
ippolito
said
that
he
would
rather
not
see
us
again
that
it
would
be
painful
to
him
why
we
could
ask
ferris
to
hand
him
the
oh
no
no
no
mother
cried
florida
hiding
her
face
that
would
be
too
horribly
indelicate
well
perhaps
it
wouldn
t
be
quite
good
taste
said
vervain
perturbedly
but
you
needn
t
express
yourself
so
violently
my
dear
it
s
not
a
matter
of
life
and
death
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
we
must
stop
at
don
ippolito
s
house
i
suppose
don
t
you
think
so
yes
faintly
assented
the
daughter
vervain
yawned
well
i
can
t
think
anything
more
about
it
i
m
too
stupid
but
that
s
the
way
we
shall
do
will
you
help
me
to
bed
my
dear
i
shall
be
good
for
nothing
she
went
on
talking
of
don
ippolito
s
change
of
purpose
till
her
head
touched
the
pillow
from
which
she
suddenly
lifted
it
again
and
called
out
to
her
daughter
who
had
passed
into
the
next
room
but
ferris
why
didn
t
he
come
back
with
you
come
back
with
me
why
yes
child
i
sent
him
out
to
call
you
just
before
you
came
in
this
don
ippolito
business
put
him
quite
out
of
my
head
didn
t
you
see
him
oh
what
s
that
nothing
i
dropped
my
you
re
sure
you
didn
t
set
anything
on
fire
no
it
went
dead
light
it
again
and
do
look
now
is
everything
right
it
s
queer
he
didn
t
come
back
to
he
couldn
t
find
you
what
do
you
suppose
became
of
him
i
don
t
know
it
s
very
perplexing
i
wish
ferris
were
not
so
odd
it
quite
borders
on
affectation
i
don
t
know
what
to
make
of
it
we
must
send
word
to
him
the
very
first
thing
morning
that
we
re
going
and
ask
him
to
come
to
see
florida
made
no
reply
she
sat
staring
at
the
black
space
of
the
doorway
into
her
mother
s
room
vervain
did
not
speak
again
after
a
while
her
daughter
softly
entered
her
chamber
shading
the
candle
with
her
hand
and
seeing
that
she
slept
softly
withdrew
closed
the
door
and
went
about
the
work
of
packing
again
when
it
was
all
done
she
flung
herself
upon
her
bed
and
hid
her
face
in
the
pillow
the
next
morning
was
spent
in
bestowing
those
interminable
last
touches
which
the
packing
of
ladies
baggage
demands
and
in
taking
leave
with
largess
in
which
vervain
shone
of
all
the
people
in
the
house
and
out
of
it
who
had
so
much
as
touched
a
hat
to
the
vervains
during
their
sojourn
the
whole
was
not
a
vast
sum
nor
did
the
sundry
extortions
of
the
padrone
come
to
much
though
the
honest
man
racked
his
brain
to
invent
injuries
to
his
apartments
and
furniture
being
unmurmuringly
paid
he
gave
way
to
his
real
goodwill
for
his
tenants
in
many
little
useful
offices
at
the
end
he
persisted
in
sending
them
to
the
station
in
his
own
gondola
and
could
with
difficulty
be
kept
from
going
with
them
vervain
had
early
sent
a
message
to
ferris
but
word
came
back
a
first
and
a
second
time
that
he
was
not
at
home
and
the
forenoon
wore
away
and
he
had
not
appeared
a
certain
indignation
sustained
her
till
the
gondola
pushed
out
into
the
canal
and
then
it
yielded
to
an
intolerable
regret
that
she
should
not
see
him
i
go
without
saying
to
ferris
florida
she
said
at
last
and
it
s
no
use
asking
me
he
may
have
been
wanting
a
little
in
politeness
but
he
s
been
good
all
along
and
we
owe
him
too
much
not
to
make
an
effort
to
thank
him
before
we
go
we
really
must
stop
a
moment
at
his
florida
who
had
regarded
her
mother
s
efforts
to
summon
ferris
to
them
with
passive
coldness
turned
a
look
of
agony
upon
her
but
in
a
moment
she
bade
the
gondolier
stop
at
the
consulate
and
dropping
her
veil
over
her
face
fell
back
in
the
shadow
of
the
vervain
sentimentalized
their
departure
a
little
but
her
daughter
made
no
comment
on
the
scene
they
were
leaving
the
gondolier
rang
at
ferris
s
door
and
returned
with
the
answer
that
he
was
not
at
home
vervain
gave
way
to
despair
oh
dear
oh
dear
this
is
too
bad
what
shall
we
do
we
ll
lose
the
train
mother
if
we
loiter
in
this
way
said
florida
well
wait
i
leave
a
message
at
could
you
be
she
wrote
on
her
card
we
called
to
say
we
ve
changed
our
plans
and
we
re
going
i
shall
write
you
a
nice
scolding
letter
from
verona
we
re
going
over
the
brenner
for
your
behavior
last
night
who
will
keep
you
straight
when
i
m
gone
you
ve
been
very
very
kind
florida
joins
me
in
a
thousand
thanks
regrets
and
there
i
haven
t
said
anything
after
all
she
fretted
with
tears
in
her
eyes
the
gondolier
carried
the
card
again
to
the
door
where
ferris
s
servant
let
down
a
basket
by
a
string
and
fished
it
up
if
don
ippolito
shouldn
t
be
in
said
vervain
as
the
boat
moved
on
again
i
don
t
know
what
i
do
with
this
money
it
will
be
awkward
beyond
the
gondola
slipped
from
the
canalazzo
into
the
network
of
the
smaller
canals
where
the
dense
shadows
were
as
old
as
the
palaces
that
cast
them
and
stopped
at
the
landing
of
a
narrow
quay
the
gondolier
dismounted
and
rang
at
don
ippolito
s
door
there
was
no
response
he
rang
again
and
again
at
last
from
a
window
of
the
uppermost
story
the
head
of
the
priest
himself
peered
out
the
gondolier
touched
his
hat
and
said
it
is
the
ladies
who
ask
for
you
don
it
was
a
minute
before
the
door
opened
and
the
priest
and
blinking
in
the
strong
light
came
with
a
stupefied
air
across
the
quay
to
the
well
don
ippolito
cried
vervain
rising
and
giving
him
her
hand
which
she
first
waved
at
the
trunks
and
bags
piled
up
in
the
vacant
space
in
the
front
of
the
boat
what
do
you
think
of
this
we
are
really
going
immediately
can
change
our
minds
too
and
i
don
t
think
it
would
have
been
too
much
she
added
with
a
friendly
smile
if
we
had
gone
without
saying
to
you
what
in
the
world
does
it
all
mean
your
giving
up
that
grand
project
of
yours
so
suddenly
she
sat
down
again
that
she
might
talk
more
at
her
ease
and
seemed
thoroughly
happy
to
have
don
ippolito
before
her
again
it
finally
appeared
best
madama
he
said
quietly
after
a
quick
keen
glance
at
florida
who
did
not
lift
her
veil
well
perhaps
you
re
partly
right
but
i
can
t
help
thinking
that
you
with
your
talent
would
have
succeeded
in
america
inventors
do
get
on
there
in
the
most
surprising
way
there
s
the
screw
company
of
providence
it
s
such
a
simple
thing
and
now
the
shares
are
worth
eight
hundred
are
you
well
don
ippolito
quite
well
i
thought
you
looked
rather
pale
but
i
believe
you
re
always
a
little
pale
you
mustn
t
work
too
hard
we
shall
miss
you
a
great
deal
don
thanks
yes
we
shall
be
quite
lost
without
you
and
i
wanted
to
say
this
to
you
don
ippolito
that
if
ever
you
change
your
mind
again
and
conclude
to
come
to
america
you
must
write
to
me
and
let
me
help
you
just
as
i
had
intended
to
the
priest
shivered
as
if
cold
and
gave
another
look
at
florida
s
veiled
face
you
are
too
good
he
said
yes
i
really
think
i
am
replied
vervain
playfully
considering
that
you
were
going
to
let
me
leave
venice
without
even
trying
to
say
to
me
i
think
i
m
very
good
vervain
s
mood
became
overcast
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
i
hope
you
re
sorry
to
have
us
going
don
ippolito
for
you
know
how
very
highly
i
prize
your
acquaintance
it
was
rather
cruel
of
you
i
she
seemed
not
to
remember
that
he
could
not
have
known
of
their
change
of
plan
don
ippolito
looked
imploringly
into
her
face
and
made
a
touching
gesture
of
deprecation
but
did
not
speak
i
m
really
afraid
you
re
well
and
i
think
it
s
too
bad
of
us
to
be
going
resumed
vervain
but
it
can
t
be
helped
now
we
are
all
packed
don
t
you
see
but
i
want
to
ask
one
favor
of
you
don
ippolito
and
that
is
said
vervain
covertly
taking
a
little
from
her
pocket
that
you
ll
leave
these
inventions
of
yours
for
a
while
and
give
yourself
a
vacation
you
need
rest
of
mind
go
into
the
country
somewhere
do
that
s
what
s
preying
upon
you
but
we
must
really
be
off
now
shake
hands
with
florida
i
m
going
to
be
the
last
to
part
with
you
she
said
with
a
tearful
smile
don
ippolito
and
florida
extended
their
hands
neither
spoke
and
as
she
sank
back
upon
the
seat
from
which
she
had
half
risen
she
drew
more
closely
the
folds
of
the
veil
which
she
had
not
lifted
from
her
face
vervain
gave
a
little
sob
as
don
ippolito
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
and
she
had
some
difficulty
in
leaving
with
him
the
rouleau
which
she
tried
artfully
to
press
into
his
palm
she
said
don
t
drop
it
and
attempted
to
close
his
fingers
over
it
but
he
let
it
lie
carelessly
in
his
open
hand
as
the
gondola
moved
off
and
there
it
still
lay
as
he
stood
watching
the
boat
slip
under
a
bridge
at
the
next
corner
and
disappear
while
he
stood
there
gazing
at
the
empty
arch
a
man
of
a
wild
and
savage
aspect
approached
it
was
said
that
this
man
s
brain
had
been
turned
by
the
death
of
his
brother
who
was
betrayed
to
the
austrians
after
the
revolution
of
by
his
wife
s
confessor
he
advanced
with
swift
strides
and
at
the
moment
he
reached
don
ippolito
s
side
he
suddenly
turned
his
face
upon
him
and
cursed
him
through
his
clenched
teeth
dog
of
a
priest
don
ippolito
as
if
his
whole
race
had
renounced
him
in
the
maniac
s
words
uttered
a
desolate
cry
and
hiding
his
face
in
his
hands
tottered
into
his
house
the
rouleau
had
dropped
from
his
palm
it
rolled
down
the
shelving
marble
of
the
quay
and
slipped
into
the
water
the
young
beggar
who
had
held
vervain
s
gondola
to
the
shore
while
she
talked
looked
up
and
down
the
deserted
quay
and
at
the
doors
and
windows
then
he
began
to
take
off
his
clothes
for
a
bath
xvii
ferris
returned
at
nightfall
to
his
house
where
he
had
not
been
since
daybreak
and
flung
himself
exhausted
upon
the
bed
his
face
was
burnt
red
with
the
sun
and
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
he
fell
into
a
doze
and
dreamed
that
he
was
still
at
malamocco
whither
he
had
gone
that
morning
in
a
sort
of
craze
with
some
fishermen
who
were
to
cast
their
nets
there
then
he
was
rowing
back
to
venice
across
the
lagoon
that
seemed
a
molten
fire
under
the
keel
he
woke
with
a
heavy
groan
and
bade
marina
fetch
him
a
light
she
set
it
on
the
table
and
handed
him
the
card
vervain
had
left
he
read
it
and
read
it
again
and
then
he
laid
it
down
and
putting
on
his
hat
he
took
his
cane
and
went
out
do
not
wait
for
me
marina
he
said
i
may
be
late
go
to
he
returned
at
midnight
and
lighting
his
candle
took
up
the
card
and
read
it
once
more
he
could
not
tell
whether
to
be
glad
or
sorry
that
he
had
failed
to
see
the
vervains
again
he
took
it
for
granted
that
don
ippolito
was
to
follow
he
would
not
ask
himself
what
motive
had
hastened
their
going
the
reasons
were
all
that
he
should
never
more
look
upon
the
woman
so
hatefully
lost
to
him
but
a
strong
instinct
of
his
heart
struggled
against
them
he
lay
down
in
his
clothes
and
began
to
dream
almost
before
he
began
to
sleep
he
woke
early
and
went
out
to
walk
he
did
not
rest
all
day
once
he
came
home
and
found
a
letter
from
vervain
postmarked
verona
reiterating
her
lamentations
and
adieux
and
explaining
that
the
priest
had
relinquished
his
purpose
and
would
not
go
to
america
at
all
the
deeper
mystery
in
which
this
news
left
him
was
not
less
sinister
than
before
in
the
weeks
that
followed
ferris
had
no
other
purpose
than
to
reduce
the
days
to
hours
the
hours
to
minutes
the
burden
that
fell
upon
him
when
he
woke
lay
heavy
on
his
heart
till
night
and
oppressed
him
far
into
his
sleep
he
could
not
give
his
trouble
certain
shape
what
was
mostly
with
him
was
a
formless
loss
which
he
could
not
resolve
into
any
definite
shame
or
wrong
at
times
what
he
had
seen
seemed
to
him
some
baleful
trick
of
the
imagination
some
lurid
and
foolish
illusion
but
he
could
do
nothing
he
could
not
ask
himself
what
the
end
was
to
be
he
kept
indoors
by
day
trying
to
work
trying
to
read
marveling
somewhat
that
he
did
not
fall
sick
and
die
at
night
he
set
out
on
long
walks
which
took
him
he
cared
not
where
and
often
detained
him
till
the
gray
lights
of
morning
began
to
tremble
through
the
nocturnal
blue
but
even
by
night
he
shunned
the
neighborhood
in
which
the
vervains
had
lived
their
landlord
sent
him
a
package
of
trifles
they
had
left
behind
but
he
refused
to
receive
them
sending
back
word
that
he
did
not
know
where
the
ladies
were
he
had
half
expected
that
vervain
though
he
had
not
answered
her
last
letter
might
write
to
him
again
from
england
but
she
did
not
the
vervains
had
passed
out
of
his
world
he
knew
that
they
had
been
in
it
only
by
the
torment
they
had
left
him
he
wondered
in
a
listless
way
that
he
should
see
nothing
of
don
ippolito
once
at
midnight
he
fancied
that
the
priest
was
coming
towards
him
across
a
campo
he
had
just
entered
he
stopped
and
turned
back
into
the
calle
when
the
priest
came
up
to
him
it
was
not
don
ippolito
in
these
days
ferris
received
a
dispatch
from
the
department
of
state
informing
him
that
his
successor
had
been
appointed
and
directing
him
to
deliver
up
the
consular
flags
seals
archives
and
other
property
of
the
united
states
no
reason
for
his
removal
was
given
but
as
there
had
never
been
any
reason
for
his
appointment
he
had
no
right
to
complain
the
balance
was
exactly
dressed
by
this
simple
device
of
our
civil
service
he
determined
not
to
wait
for
the
coming
of
his
successor
before
giving
up
the
consular
effects
and
he
placed
them
at
once
in
the
keeping
of
the
worthy
who
had
so
often
transferred
them
from
departing
to
arriving
consuls
then
being
quite
ready
at
any
moment
to
leave
venice
he
found
himself
in
nowise
eager
to
go
but
he
began
in
a
desultory
way
to
pack
up
his
sketches
and
studies
one
morning
as
he
sat
idle
in
his
dismantled
studio
marina
came
to
tell
him
that
an
old
woman
waiting
at
the
door
below
wished
to
speak
with
him
well
let
her
come
up
said
ferris
wearily
and
presently
marina
returned
with
a
very
beldam
who
stared
hard
at
him
while
he
frowningly
puzzled
himself
as
to
where
he
had
seen
that
malign
visage
before
well
he
said
harshly
i
come
answered
the
old
woman
on
the
part
of
don
ippolito
rondinelli
who
desires
so
much
to
see
your
ferris
made
no
response
while
the
old
woman
knotted
the
fringe
of
her
shawl
with
quaking
hands
and
presently
added
with
a
tenderness
in
her
voice
which
oddly
discorded
with
the
hardness
of
her
face
he
has
been
very
sick
poor
thing
with
a
fever
but
now
he
is
in
his
senses
again
and
the
doctors
say
he
will
get
well
i
hope
so
but
he
is
still
very
weak
he
tried
to
write
two
lines
to
you
but
he
had
not
the
strength
so
he
bade
me
bring
you
this
word
that
he
had
something
to
say
which
it
greatly
concerned
you
to
hear
and
that
he
prayed
you
to
forgive
his
not
coming
to
revere
you
for
it
was
impossible
and
that
you
should
have
the
goodness
to
do
him
this
favor
to
come
to
find
him
the
quickest
you
the
old
woman
wiped
her
eyes
with
the
corner
of
her
shawl
and
her
chin
wobbled
pathetically
while
she
shot
a
glance
of
baleful
dislike
at
ferris
who
answered
after
a
long
dull
stare
at
her
tell
him
i
ll
he
did
not
believe
that
don
ippolito
could
tell
him
anything
that
greatly
concerned
him
but
he
was
worn
out
with
going
round
in
the
same
circle
of
conjecture
and
so
far
as
he
could
be
glad
he
was
glad
of
this
chance
to
face
his
calamity
he
would
go
but
not
at
once
he
would
think
it
over
he
would
go
when
he
had
got
some
grasp
of
the
matter
the
old
woman
lingered
tell
him
i
ll
come
repeated
ferris
impatiently
a
thousand
excuses
but
my
poor
master
has
been
very
sick
the
doctors
say
he
will
get
well
i
hope
so
but
he
is
very
weak
indeed
a
little
shock
a
little
disappointment
is
the
signore
very
much
occupied
this
morning
he
greatly
desired
he
prayed
that
if
such
a
thing
were
possible
in
the
goodness
of
your
excellency
but
i
am
offending
the
signore
what
do
you
want
demanded
ferris
the
old
wretch
set
up
a
pitiful
whimper
and
tried
to
possess
herself
of
his
hand
she
kissed
his
instead
that
you
will
return
with
me
she
besought
him
oh
i
ll
go
groaned
the
painter
i
might
as
well
go
first
as
last
he
added
in
english
there
stop
that
enough
enough
i
tell
you
didn
t
i
say
i
was
going
with
you
he
cried
to
the
old
woman
god
bless
you
she
mumbled
and
set
off
before
him
down
the
stairs
and
out
of
the
door
she
looked
so
miserably
old
and
weary
that
he
called
a
gondola
to
his
landing
and
made
her
get
into
it
with
him
it
tormented
don
ippolito
s
idle
neighborhood
to
see
veneranda
arrive
in
such
state
and
a
passionate
excitement
arose
at
the
caffè
where
the
person
of
the
consul
was
known
when
ferris
entered
the
priest
s
house
with
her
he
had
not
often
visited
don
ippolito
but
the
quaintness
of
the
place
had
been
so
vividly
impressed
upon
him
that
he
had
a
certain
familiarity
with
the
of
the
anteroom
the
paintings
of
the
parlor
and
the
puerile
arrangement
of
the
piano
and
melodeon
veneranda
led
him
through
these
rooms
to
the
chamber
where
don
ippolito
had
first
shown
him
his
inventions
they
were
all
removed
now
and
on
a
bed
set
against
the
wall
opposite
the
door
lay
the
priest
with
his
hands
on
his
breast
and
a
faint
smile
on
his
lips
so
peaceful
so
serene
that
the
painter
stopped
with
a
sudden
awe
as
if
he
had
unawares
come
into
the
presence
of
death
advance
advance
whispered
the
old
woman
near
the
head
of
the
bed
sat
a
priest
wearing
the
red
stockings
of
a
canonico
his
face
was
fanatically
stern
but
he
rose
and
bowed
courteously
to
ferris
the
stir
of
his
robes
roused
don
ippolito
he
slowly
and
weakly
turned
his
head
and
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
painter
he
made
a
helpless
gesture
of
salutation
with
his
thin
hand
and
began
to
excuse
himself
for
the
trouble
he
had
given
with
a
gentle
politeness
that
touched
the
painter
s
heart
through
all
the
complex
resentments
that
divided
them
it
was
indeed
a
strange
ground
on
which
the
two
men
met
ferris
could
not
have
described
don
ippolito
as
his
enemy
for
the
priest
had
wittingly
done
him
no
wrong
he
could
not
have
logically
hated
him
as
a
rival
for
till
it
was
too
late
he
had
not
confessed
to
his
own
heart
the
love
that
was
in
it
he
knew
no
evil
of
don
ippolito
he
could
not
accuse
him
of
any
betrayal
of
trust
or
violation
of
confidence
he
felt
merely
that
this
hapless
creature
lying
so
deathlike
before
him
had
profaned
however
involuntarily
what
was
sacredest
in
the
world
to
him
beyond
this
all
was
chaos
he
had
heard
of
the
priest
s
sickness
with
a
fierce
hardening
of
the
heart
yet
as
he
beheld
him
now
he
began
to
remember
things
that
moved
him
to
a
sort
of
remorse
he
recalled
again
the
simple
loyalty
with
which
don
ippolito
had
first
spoken
to
him
of
miss
vervain
and
tried
to
learn
his
own
feeling
toward
her
he
thought
how
trustfully
at
their
last
meeting
the
priest
had
declared
his
love
and
hope
and
how
when
he
had
coldly
received
his
confession
don
ippolito
had
solemnly
adjured
him
to
be
frank
with
him
and
ferris
could
not
that
pity
for
himself
as
the
prey
of
fantastically
cruel
chances
which
he
had
already
vaguely
felt
began
now
also
to
include
the
priest
ignoring
all
but
that
compassion
he
went
up
to
the
bed
and
took
the
weak
chill
nerveless
hand
in
his
own
the
canonico
rose
and
placed
his
chair
for
ferris
beside
the
pillow
on
which
lay
a
brass
crucifix
and
then
softly
left
the
room
exchanging
a
glance
of
affectionate
intelligence
with
the
sick
man
i
might
have
waited
a
little
while
said
don
ippolito
weakly
speaking
in
a
hollow
voice
that
was
the
shadow
of
his
old
deep
tones
but
you
will
know
how
to
forgive
the
impatience
of
a
man
not
yet
quite
master
of
himself
i
thank
you
for
coming
i
have
been
very
sick
as
you
see
i
did
not
think
to
live
i
did
not
care
i
am
very
weak
now
let
me
say
to
you
quickly
what
i
want
to
say
dear
friend
continued
don
ippolito
fixing
his
eyes
upon
the
painter
s
face
i
spoke
to
her
that
night
after
i
had
parted
from
the
priest
s
voice
was
now
firm
the
painter
turned
his
face
away
i
spoke
without
hope
proceeded
don
ippolito
and
because
i
must
i
spoke
in
vain
all
was
lost
all
was
past
in
a
the
coil
of
suspicions
and
misgivings
and
fears
in
which
ferris
had
lived
was
suddenly
without
a
clew
he
could
not
look
upon
the
pallid
visage
of
the
priest
lest
he
should
now
at
last
find
there
that
subtle
expression
of
deceit
the
whirl
of
his
thoughts
kept
him
silent
don
ippolito
went
on
even
if
i
had
never
been
a
priest
i
would
still
have
been
impossible
to
her
she
he
stopped
as
if
for
want
of
strength
to
go
on
all
at
once
he
cried
listen
and
he
rapidly
recounted
the
story
of
his
life
ending
with
the
fatal
tragedy
of
his
love
when
it
was
told
he
said
calmly
but
now
everything
is
over
with
me
on
earth
i
thank
the
infinite
compassion
for
the
sorrows
through
which
i
have
passed
i
also
have
proved
the
miraculous
power
of
the
church
potent
to
save
in
all
he
gathered
the
crucifix
in
his
spectral
grasp
and
pressed
it
to
his
lips
many
merciful
things
have
befallen
me
on
this
bed
of
sickness
my
uncle
whom
the
long
years
of
my
darkness
divided
from
me
is
once
more
at
peace
with
me
even
that
poor
old
woman
whom
i
sent
to
call
you
and
who
had
served
me
as
i
believed
with
hate
for
me
as
a
false
priest
in
her
heart
has
devoted
herself
day
and
night
to
my
helplessness
she
has
grown
decrepit
with
her
cares
and
vigils
yes
i
have
had
many
and
signal
marks
of
the
divine
pity
to
be
grateful
he
paused
breathing
quickly
and
then
added
they
tell
me
that
the
danger
of
this
sickness
is
past
but
none
the
less
i
have
died
in
it
when
i
rise
from
this
bed
it
shall
be
to
take
the
vows
of
a
carmelite
ferris
made
no
answer
and
don
ippolito
resumed
i
have
told
you
how
when
i
first
owned
to
her
the
falsehood
in
which
i
lived
she
besought
me
to
try
if
i
might
not
find
consolation
in
the
holy
life
to
which
i
had
been
devoted
when
you
see
her
dear
friend
will
you
not
tell
her
that
i
came
to
understand
that
this
comfort
this
refuge
awaited
me
in
the
cell
of
the
carmelite
i
have
brought
so
much
trouble
into
her
life
that
i
would
fain
have
her
know
i
have
found
peace
where
she
bade
me
seek
it
that
i
have
mastered
my
affliction
by
reconciling
myself
to
it
tell
her
that
but
for
her
pity
and
fear
for
me
i
believe
that
i
must
have
died
in
my
it
was
perhaps
inevitable
from
ferris
s
protestant
association
of
monks
and
convents
and
penances
chiefly
with
the
machinery
of
fiction
that
all
this
affected
him
as
unreally
as
talk
in
a
his
heart
was
cold
as
he
answered
i
am
glad
that
your
mind
is
at
rest
concerning
the
doubts
which
so
long
troubled
you
not
all
men
are
so
easily
pacified
but
as
you
say
it
is
the
privilege
of
your
church
to
work
miracles
as
to
miss
vervain
i
am
sorry
that
i
can
not
promise
to
give
her
your
message
i
shall
never
see
her
again
excuse
me
he
continued
but
your
servant
said
there
was
something
you
wished
to
say
that
concerned
me
you
will
never
see
her
again
cried
the
priest
struggling
to
lift
himself
upon
his
elbow
and
falling
back
upon
the
pillow
oh
bereft
oh
deaf
and
blind
it
was
that
she
loved
she
confessed
it
to
me
that
wait
said
ferris
trying
to
steady
his
voice
and
failing
i
was
with
vervain
that
night
she
sent
me
into
the
garden
to
call
her
daughter
and
i
saw
how
miss
vervain
parted
from
the
man
she
did
not
love
i
saw
it
was
a
horrible
thing
to
have
said
it
he
felt
now
that
he
had
spoken
a
sense
of
the
indelicacy
the
shamefulness
seemed
to
alienate
him
from
all
high
concern
in
the
matter
and
to
leave
him
a
mere
eavesdropper
his
face
flamed
the
wavering
hopes
the
wavering
doubts
alike
died
in
his
heart
he
had
fallen
below
the
dignity
of
his
own
trouble
you
saw
you
saw
softly
repeated
the
priest
without
looking
at
him
and
without
any
show
of
emotion
apparently
the
convalescence
that
had
brought
him
perfect
clearness
of
reason
had
left
his
sensibilities
still
somewhat
dulled
he
closed
his
lips
and
lay
silent
at
last
he
asked
very
gently
and
how
shall
i
make
you
believe
that
what
you
saw
was
not
a
woman
s
love
but
an
angel
s
heavenly
pity
for
me
does
it
seem
hard
to
believe
this
of
her
yes
answered
the
painter
doggedly
it
is
and
yet
it
is
the
very
truth
oh
you
do
not
know
her
you
never
knew
her
in
the
same
moment
that
she
denied
me
her
love
she
divined
the
anguish
of
my
soul
and
with
that
embrace
she
sought
to
console
me
for
the
friendlessness
of
a
whole
life
past
and
to
come
but
i
know
that
i
waste
my
words
on
you
he
cried
bitterly
you
never
would
see
me
as
i
was
you
would
find
no
singleness
in
me
and
yet
i
had
a
heart
as
full
of
loyalty
to
you
as
love
for
her
in
what
have
i
been
false
to
you
you
never
were
false
to
me
answered
ferris
and
god
knows
i
have
been
true
to
you
and
at
what
cost
we
might
well
curse
the
day
we
met
don
ippolito
for
we
have
only
done
each
other
harm
but
i
never
meant
you
harm
and
now
i
ask
you
to
forgive
me
if
i
can
not
believe
you
i
can
not
yet
i
am
of
another
race
from
you
slow
to
suspect
slow
to
trust
give
me
a
little
time
let
me
see
you
again
i
want
to
go
away
and
think
i
don
t
question
your
truth
i
m
afraid
you
don
t
know
i
m
afraid
that
the
same
deceit
has
tricked
us
both
i
must
come
to
you
can
i
he
rose
and
stood
beside
the
couch
surely
surely
answered
the
priest
looking
into
ferris
s
troubled
eyes
with
calm
meekness
you
will
do
me
the
greatest
pleasure
yes
come
again
you
know
he
said
with
a
sad
smile
referring
to
his
purpose
of
taking
vows
that
my
time
in
the
world
is
short
adieu
to
meet
again
he
took
ferris
s
hand
hanging
weak
and
hot
by
his
side
and
drew
him
gently
down
by
it
and
kissed
him
on
either
bearded
cheek
it
is
our
custom
you
know
among
the
canonico
in
the
anteroom
bowed
austerely
to
him
as
he
passed
through
the
old
woman
refused
with
a
harsh
nothing
the
money
he
offered
her
at
the
door
he
bitterly
upbraided
himself
for
the
doubts
he
could
not
banish
and
he
still
flushed
with
shame
that
he
should
have
declared
his
knowledge
of
a
scene
which
ought
at
its
worst
to
have
been
inviolable
by
his
speech
he
scarcely
cared
now
for
the
woman
about
whom
these
miseries
grouped
themselves
he
realized
that
a
fantastic
remorse
may
be
stronger
than
a
jealous
love
he
longed
for
the
morrow
to
come
that
he
might
confess
his
shame
and
regret
but
a
reaction
to
this
violent
repentance
came
before
the
night
fell
as
the
sound
of
the
priest
s
voice
and
the
sight
of
his
wasted
face
faded
from
the
painter
s
sense
he
began
to
see
everything
in
the
old
light
again
then
what
don
ippolito
had
said
took
a
character
of
ludicrous
of
insolent
improbability
after
dark
ferris
set
out
upon
one
of
his
long
rambling
walks
he
walked
hard
and
fast
to
try
if
he
might
not
still
by
mere
fatigue
of
body
the
anguish
that
filled
his
soul
but
whichever
way
he
went
he
came
again
and
again
to
the
house
of
don
ippolito
and
at
last
he
stopped
there
leaning
against
the
parapet
of
the
quay
and
staring
at
the
house
as
though
he
would
spell
from
the
senseless
stones
the
truth
of
the
secret
they
sheltered
far
up
in
the
chamber
where
he
knew
that
the
priest
lay
the
windows
were
dimly
lit
as
he
stood
thus
with
his
upturned
face
haggard
in
the
moonlight
the
soldier
commanding
the
austrian
patrol
which
passed
that
way
halted
his
squad
and
seemed
about
to
ask
him
what
he
wanted
there
ferris
turned
and
walked
swiftly
homeward
but
he
did
not
even
lie
down
his
misery
took
the
shape
of
an
intent
that
would
not
suffer
him
to
rest
he
meant
to
go
to
don
ippolito
and
tell
him
that
his
story
had
failed
of
its
effect
that
he
was
not
to
be
fooled
so
easily
and
without
demanding
anything
further
to
leave
him
in
his
lie
at
the
earliest
hour
when
he
might
hope
to
be
admitted
he
went
and
rang
the
bell
furiously
the
door
opened
and
he
confronted
the
priest
s
servant
i
want
to
see
don
ippolito
said
ferris
abruptly
it
can
not
be
she
began
i
tell
you
i
must
cried
ferris
raising
his
voice
i
tell
madman
fiercely
whispered
the
old
woman
shaking
both
her
open
hands
in
his
face
he
s
dead
he
died
last
night
xviii
the
terrible
stroke
sobered
ferris
he
woke
from
his
long
debauch
of
hate
and
jealousy
and
despair
for
the
first
time
since
that
night
in
the
garden
he
faced
his
fate
with
a
clear
mind
death
had
set
his
seal
forever
to
a
testimony
which
he
had
been
able
neither
to
refuse
nor
to
accept
in
abject
sorrow
and
shame
he
thanked
god
that
he
had
been
kept
from
dealing
that
last
cruel
blow
but
if
don
ippolito
had
come
back
from
the
dead
to
repeat
his
witness
ferris
felt
that
the
miracle
could
not
change
his
own
passive
state
there
was
now
but
one
thing
in
the
world
for
him
to
do
to
see
florida
to
confront
her
with
his
knowledge
of
all
that
had
been
and
to
abide
by
her
word
whatever
it
was
at
the
worst
there
was
the
war
whose
drums
had
already
called
to
him
for
a
refuge
he
thought
at
first
that
he
might
perhaps
overtake
the
vervains
before
they
sailed
for
america
but
he
remembered
that
they
had
left
venice
six
weeks
before
it
seemed
impossible
that
he
could
wait
but
when
he
landed
in
new
york
he
was
tormented
in
his
impatience
by
a
strange
reluctance
and
hesitation
a
fantastic
light
fell
upon
his
plans
a
sense
of
its
wildness
enfeebled
his
purpose
what
was
he
going
to
do
had
he
come
four
thousand
miles
to
tell
florida
that
don
ippolito
was
dead
or
was
he
going
to
say
i
have
heard
that
you
love
me
but
i
don
t
believe
it
is
it
true
he
pushed
on
to
providence
stifling
these
antic
misgivings
as
he
might
and
without
allowing
himself
time
to
falter
from
his
intent
he
set
out
to
find
vervain
s
house
he
knew
the
street
and
the
number
for
she
had
often
given
him
the
address
in
her
invitations
against
the
time
when
he
should
return
to
america
as
he
drew
near
the
house
a
tender
trepidation
filled
him
and
silenced
all
other
senses
in
him
his
heart
beat
thickly
the
universe
included
only
the
fact
that
he
was
to
look
upon
the
face
he
loved
and
this
fact
had
neither
past
nor
future
but
a
terrible
foreboding
as
of
death
seized
him
when
he
stood
before
the
house
and
glanced
up
at
its
front
and
round
upon
the
dusty
and
neglected
of
the
with
a
cold
hand
he
rang
and
rang
again
and
no
answer
came
at
last
a
man
lounged
up
to
the
fence
from
the
next
guess
you
won
t
make
anybody
hear
he
said
casually
doesn
t
vervain
live
in
this
house
asked
ferris
finding
a
husky
voice
in
his
throat
that
sounded
to
him
like
some
other
s
voice
lost
there
she
used
to
but
she
isn
t
at
home
family
s
in
they
had
not
come
back
yet
thanks
said
ferris
mechanically
and
he
went
away
he
laughed
to
himself
at
this
keen
irony
of
fortune
he
was
prepared
for
the
confirmation
of
his
doubts
he
was
ready
for
relief
from
them
heaven
knew
but
this
blank
that
the
turn
of
the
wheel
had
brought
this
nothing
the
vervains
were
as
lost
to
him
as
if
europe
were
in
another
planet
how
should
he
find
them
there
besides
he
was
poor
he
had
no
money
to
get
back
with
if
he
had
wanted
to
return
he
took
the
first
train
to
new
york
and
hunted
up
a
young
fellow
of
his
acquaintance
who
in
the
days
of
peace
had
been
one
of
the
governor
s
aides
he
was
still
holding
this
place
and
was
an
ardent
recruiter
he
hailed
with
rapture
the
expression
of
ferris
s
wish
to
go
into
the
war
look
here
he
said
after
a
moment
s
thought
didn
t
you
have
some
rank
as
a
consul
yes
replied
ferris
with
a
dreary
smile
i
have
been
equivalent
to
a
commander
in
the
navy
and
a
colonel
in
the
army
i
don
t
mean
both
but
good
cried
his
friend
we
must
strike
high
the
colonelcies
are
rather
inaccessible
just
at
present
and
so
are
the
but
a
majorship
now
oh
no
don
t
pleaded
ferris
make
me
a
corporal
or
a
cook
i
shall
not
be
so
mischievous
to
our
own
side
then
and
when
the
other
fellows
shoot
me
i
shall
not
be
so
much
of
a
oh
they
won
t
you
expostulated
his
friend
he
got
ferris
a
commission
as
second
lieutenant
and
lent
him
money
to
buy
a
uniform
ferris
s
regiment
was
sent
to
a
part
of
the
southwest
where
he
saw
a
good
deal
of
fighting
and
fever
and
ague
at
the
end
of
two
years
spent
alternately
in
the
field
and
the
hospital
he
was
riding
out
near
the
camp
one
morning
in
unusual
spirits
when
two
men
in
butternut
fired
at
him
one
had
the
mortification
to
miss
him
the
bullet
of
the
other
struck
him
in
the
arm
there
was
talk
of
amputation
at
first
but
the
case
was
finally
managed
without
in
ferris
s
state
of
health
it
was
quite
the
same
an
end
of
his
soldiering
he
came
north
sick
and
maimed
and
poor
he
smiled
now
to
think
of
confronting
florida
in
any
imperative
or
challenging
spirit
but
the
current
of
his
hopeless
melancholy
turned
more
and
more
towards
her
he
had
once
at
a
desperate
venture
written
to
her
at
providence
but
he
had
got
no
answer
he
asked
of
a
providence
man
among
the
artists
in
new
york
if
he
knew
the
vervains
the
providence
man
said
that
he
did
know
them
a
little
when
he
was
much
younger
they
had
been
abroad
a
great
deal
he
believed
in
a
dim
way
that
they
were
still
in
europe
the
young
one
he
added
used
to
have
a
temper
of
her
own
indeed
said
ferris
stiffly
the
one
fast
friend
whom
he
found
in
new
york
was
the
governor
s
dashing
aide
the
enthusiasm
of
this
recruiter
of
regiments
had
not
ceased
with
ferris
s
departure
for
the
front
the
number
of
disabled
officers
forbade
him
to
lionize
any
one
of
them
but
he
befriended
ferris
he
made
a
feint
of
discovering
the
open
secret
of
his
poverty
and
asked
how
he
could
help
him
i
don
t
know
said
ferris
it
looks
like
a
hopeless
case
to
oh
no
it
isn
t
retorted
his
friend
as
cheerfully
and
confidently
as
he
had
promised
him
that
he
should
not
be
shot
didn
t
you
bring
back
any
pictures
from
venice
with
you
i
brought
back
a
lot
of
sketches
and
studies
i
m
sorry
to
say
that
i
loafed
a
good
deal
there
i
used
to
feel
that
i
had
eternity
before
me
and
i
was
a
theorist
and
a
purist
and
an
idiot
generally
there
are
none
of
them
fit
to
be
never
mind
let
s
look
at
they
hunted
out
ferris
s
property
from
a
closet
in
the
studio
of
a
sculptor
with
whom
he
had
left
them
and
who
expressed
a
polite
pleasure
in
handing
them
over
to
ferris
rather
than
to
his
heirs
and
assigns
well
i
m
not
sure
that
i
share
your
satisfaction
old
fellow
said
the
painter
ruefully
but
he
unpacked
the
sketches
their
inspection
certainly
revealed
a
disheartening
condition
of
and
i
can
t
do
anything
to
help
the
matter
for
the
present
groaned
ferris
stopping
midway
in
the
business
and
making
as
if
to
shut
the
case
again
hold
on
said
his
friend
what
s
this
why
this
isn
t
so
it
was
the
study
of
don
ippolito
as
a
venetian
priest
which
ferris
beheld
with
a
stupid
amaze
remembering
that
he
had
meant
to
destroy
it
and
wondering
how
it
had
got
where
it
was
but
not
really
caring
much
it
s
worse
than
you
can
imagine
said
he
still
looking
at
it
with
this
apathy
no
matter
i
want
you
to
sell
it
to
me
come
i
can
t
replied
ferris
piteously
it
would
be
flat
then
put
it
into
the
the
sculptor
who
had
gone
back
to
scraping
the
chin
of
the
famous
public
man
on
whose
bust
he
was
at
work
stabbed
him
to
the
heart
with
his
and
turned
to
ferris
and
his
friend
he
slanted
his
broad
red
beard
for
a
sidelong
look
at
the
picture
and
said
i
know
what
you
mean
ferris
it
s
hard
and
it
s
feeble
in
some
ways
and
it
looks
a
little
too
much
like
experimenting
but
it
isn
t
so
don
t
be
fulsome
responded
ferris
jadedly
he
was
thinking
in
a
thoroughly
vanquished
mood
what
a
end
of
the
whole
business
it
was
that
poor
don
ippolito
should
come
to
his
rescue
in
this
fashion
and
as
it
were
offer
to
succor
him
in
his
extremity
he
perceived
the
shamefulness
of
suffering
such
help
it
would
be
much
better
to
starve
but
he
felt
cowed
and
he
had
not
courage
to
take
arms
against
this
sarcastic
destiny
which
had
pursued
him
with
a
mocking
smile
from
one
lower
level
to
another
he
rubbed
his
forehead
and
brooded
upon
the
picture
at
least
it
would
be
some
comfort
to
be
rid
of
it
and
don
ippolito
was
dead
and
to
whom
could
it
mean
more
than
the
face
of
it
his
friend
had
his
way
about
framing
it
and
it
was
got
into
the
exhibition
the
offered
it
the
hospitalities
of
an
obscure
corner
but
it
was
there
and
it
stood
its
chance
nobody
seemed
to
know
that
it
was
there
however
unless
confronted
with
it
by
ferris
s
friend
and
then
no
one
seemed
to
care
for
it
much
less
want
to
buy
it
ferris
saw
so
many
much
worse
pictures
sold
all
around
it
that
he
began
gloomily
to
respect
it
at
first
it
had
shocked
him
to
see
it
on
the
academy
s
wall
but
it
soon
came
to
have
no
other
relation
to
him
than
that
of
creatureship
like
a
poem
in
which
a
poet
celebrates
his
love
or
laments
his
dead
and
sells
for
a
price
his
pride
as
well
as
his
poverty
was
set
on
having
the
picture
sold
he
had
nothing
to
do
and
he
used
to
lurk
about
and
see
if
it
would
not
interest
somebody
at
last
but
it
remained
unsold
throughout
may
and
well
into
june
long
after
the
crowds
had
ceased
to
frequent
the
exhibition
and
only
chance
visitors
from
the
country
straggled
in
by
twos
and
threes
one
warm
dusty
afternoon
when
he
turned
into
the
academy
out
of
fourth
avenue
the
empty
hall
echoed
to
no
footfall
but
his
own
a
group
of
weary
women
who
wore
that
look
of
wanting
lunch
which
characterizes
all
at
home
and
abroad
stood
faint
before
a
certain
large
venetian
subject
which
ferris
abhorred
and
the
very
name
of
which
he
spat
out
of
his
mouth
with
loathing
for
its
unreality
he
passed
them
with
a
sombre
glance
as
he
took
his
way
toward
the
retired
spot
where
his
own
painting
hung
a
lady
whose
crapes
would
have
betrayed
to
her
own
sex
the
latest
touch
of
paris
stood
a
little
way
back
from
it
and
gazed
fixedly
at
it
the
pose
of
her
head
her
whole
attitude
expressed
a
quiet
dejection
without
seeing
her
face
one
could
know
its
air
of
pensive
wistfulness
ferris
resolved
to
indulge
himself
in
a
near
approach
to
this
unwonted
spectacle
of
interest
in
his
picture
at
the
sound
of
his
steps
the
lady
slowly
turned
a
face
of
somewhat
heavily
molded
beauty
and
from
thick
pale
hair
and
level
brows
stared
at
him
with
the
sad
eyes
of
florida
vervain
she
looked
fully
the
last
two
years
older
as
though
she
were
listening
to
the
sound
of
his
steps
in
the
dark
instead
of
having
him
there
visibly
before
her
she
kept
her
eyes
upon
him
with
a
dreamy
unrecognition
yes
it
is
i
said
ferris
as
if
she
had
spoken
she
recovered
herself
and
with
a
subdued
sorrowful
quiet
in
her
old
directness
she
answered
i
supposed
you
must
be
in
new
york
and
she
indicated
that
she
had
supposed
so
from
seeing
this
picture
ferris
felt
the
blood
mounting
to
his
head
do
you
think
it
is
like
he
asked
no
she
said
it
isn
t
just
to
him
it
attributes
things
that
didn
t
belong
to
him
and
it
leaves
out
a
great
i
could
scarcely
have
hoped
to
please
you
in
a
portrait
of
don
ferris
saw
the
red
light
break
out
as
it
used
on
the
girl
s
pale
cheeks
and
her
eyes
dilate
angrily
he
went
on
recklessly
he
sent
for
me
after
you
went
away
and
gave
me
a
message
for
you
i
never
promised
to
deliver
it
but
i
will
do
so
now
he
asked
me
to
tell
you
when
we
met
that
he
had
acted
on
your
desire
and
had
tried
to
reconcile
himself
to
his
calling
and
his
religion
he
was
going
to
enter
a
carmelite
florida
made
no
answer
but
she
seemed
to
expect
him
to
go
on
and
he
was
constrained
to
do
so
he
never
carried
out
his
purpose
ferris
said
with
a
keen
glance
at
her
he
died
the
night
after
i
saw
died
the
fan
and
the
parasol
and
the
two
or
three
light
packages
she
had
been
holding
slid
down
one
by
one
and
lay
at
her
feet
thank
you
for
bringing
me
his
last
words
she
said
but
did
not
ask
him
anything
more
ferris
did
not
offer
to
gather
up
her
things
he
stood
irresolute
presently
he
continued
with
a
downcast
look
he
had
had
a
fever
but
they
thought
he
was
getting
well
his
death
must
have
been
he
stopped
and
resumed
fiercely
resolved
to
have
the
worst
out
i
went
to
him
with
no
toward
him
the
next
day
after
i
saw
him
but
i
came
too
late
that
was
god
s
mercy
to
me
i
hope
you
have
your
consolation
miss
it
maddened
him
to
see
her
so
little
moved
and
he
meant
to
make
her
share
his
remorse
did
he
blame
me
for
anything
she
asked
no
said
ferris
with
a
bitter
laugh
he
praised
i
am
glad
of
that
returned
florida
for
i
have
thought
it
all
over
many
times
and
i
know
that
i
was
not
to
blame
though
at
first
i
blamed
myself
i
never
intended
him
anything
but
good
that
is
consolation
ferris
but
you
she
added
you
seem
to
make
yourself
my
judge
well
and
what
do
blame
me
for
i
have
a
right
to
know
what
is
in
your
the
thing
that
was
in
his
mind
had
rankled
there
for
two
years
in
many
a
black
reverie
of
those
that
alternated
with
his
moods
of
abject
and
perfect
trust
of
her
he
had
confronted
her
and
flung
it
out
upon
her
in
one
stinging
phrase
but
he
was
now
suddenly
at
a
loss
the
words
would
not
come
his
torment
fell
dumb
before
her
in
her
presence
the
cause
was
unspeakable
her
lips
had
quivered
a
little
in
making
that
demand
and
there
had
been
a
corresponding
break
in
her
voice
florida
florida
ferris
heard
himself
saying
i
loved
you
all
the
time
oh
indeed
did
you
love
me
she
cried
indignantly
while
the
tears
shone
in
her
eyes
and
was
that
why
you
left
a
helpless
young
girl
to
meet
that
trouble
alone
was
that
why
you
refused
me
your
advice
and
turned
your
back
on
me
and
snubbed
me
oh
many
thanks
for
your
love
she
dashed
the
gathered
tears
angrily
away
and
went
on
perhaps
you
knew
too
what
that
poor
priest
was
thinking
of
yes
said
ferris
stolidly
i
did
at
last
he
told
oh
then
you
acted
generously
and
nobly
to
let
him
go
on
it
was
kind
to
him
and
very
very
kind
to
me
what
could
i
do
demanded
ferris
amazed
and
furious
to
find
himself
on
the
defensive
his
telling
me
put
it
out
of
my
power
to
i
m
glad
that
you
can
satisfy
yourself
with
such
a
quibble
but
i
wonder
that
you
can
tell
woman
of
it
by
heavens
this
is
atrocious
cried
ferris
do
you
think
look
here
he
went
on
rudely
i
ll
put
the
case
to
you
and
you
shall
judge
it
remember
that
i
was
such
a
fool
as
to
be
in
love
with
you
suppose
don
ippolito
had
told
me
that
he
was
going
to
risk
everything
going
to
give
up
home
religion
friends
on
the
ten
thousandth
part
of
a
chance
that
you
might
some
day
care
for
him
i
did
not
believe
he
had
even
so
much
chance
as
that
but
he
had
always
thought
me
his
friend
and
he
trusted
me
was
it
a
quibble
that
kept
me
from
betraying
him
i
don
t
know
what
honor
is
among
women
but
no
could
have
done
it
i
confess
to
my
shame
that
i
went
to
your
house
that
night
longing
to
betray
him
and
then
suppose
your
mother
sent
me
into
the
garden
to
call
you
and
i
saw
what
has
made
my
life
a
hell
of
doubt
for
the
last
two
years
what
no
excuse
me
i
can
t
put
the
case
to
you
after
what
do
you
mean
asked
florida
i
don
t
understand
you
what
do
i
mean
you
don
t
understand
are
you
so
blind
as
that
or
are
you
making
a
fool
of
me
what
could
i
think
but
that
you
had
played
with
that
priest
s
heart
till
your
own
oh
cried
florida
with
a
shudder
starting
away
from
him
did
you
think
i
was
such
a
wicked
girl
as
that
it
was
no
defense
no
explanation
no
denial
it
simply
left
the
case
with
ferris
as
before
he
stood
looking
like
a
man
who
does
not
know
whether
to
bless
or
curse
himself
to
laugh
or
blaspheme
she
stooped
and
tried
to
pick
up
the
things
she
had
let
fall
upon
the
floor
but
she
seemed
not
able
to
find
them
he
bent
over
and
gathering
them
together
returned
them
to
her
with
his
left
hand
keeping
the
other
in
the
breast
of
his
coat
thanks
she
said
and
then
after
a
moment
have
you
been
hurt
she
asked
timidly
yes
said
ferris
in
a
sulky
way
i
have
had
my
he
glanced
down
at
his
arm
askance
it
s
rather
conventional
he
added
it
isn
t
much
of
a
hurt
but
then
i
wasn
t
much
of
a
the
girl
s
eyes
looked
reverently
at
the
conventional
arm
those
were
the
days
so
long
past
when
women
worshipped
men
for
such
things
but
she
said
nothing
and
as
ferris
s
eyes
wandered
to
her
he
received
a
novel
and
painful
impression
he
said
hesitatingly
i
have
not
asked
before
but
your
mother
miss
vervain
i
hope
she
is
well
she
is
dead
answered
florida
with
stony
quiet
they
were
both
silent
for
a
time
then
ferris
said
i
had
a
great
affection
for
your
yes
said
the
girl
she
was
fond
of
you
too
but
you
never
wrote
or
sent
her
any
word
it
used
to
grieve
her
unjust
reproach
went
to
his
heart
so
long
preoccupied
with
its
own
troubles
he
recalled
with
a
tender
remorse
the
old
venetian
days
and
the
kindliness
of
the
gracious
silly
woman
who
had
seemed
to
like
him
so
much
he
remembered
the
charm
of
her
perfect
ladylikeness
and
of
her
winning
desire
to
make
every
one
happy
to
whom
she
spoke
the
beauty
of
the
the
hospitable
soul
that
in
an
imaginably
better
world
than
this
will
outvalue
a
merely
intellectual
or
aesthetic
life
he
humbled
himself
before
her
memory
and
as
keenly
reproached
himself
as
if
he
could
have
made
her
hear
from
him
at
any
time
during
the
past
two
years
he
could
only
say
i
am
sorry
that
i
gave
your
mother
pain
i
loved
her
very
truly
i
hope
that
she
did
not
suffer
much
before
no
said
florida
it
was
a
peaceful
end
but
finally
it
was
very
sudden
she
had
not
been
well
for
many
years
with
that
sort
of
decline
i
used
sometimes
to
feel
troubled
about
her
before
we
came
to
venice
but
i
was
very
young
i
never
was
really
alarmed
till
that
day
i
went
to
i
remember
said
ferris
contritely
she
had
fainted
and
i
thought
we
ought
to
see
a
doctor
but
afterwards
because
i
thought
that
i
ought
not
to
do
so
without
speaking
to
her
i
did
not
go
to
the
doctor
and
that
day
we
made
up
our
minds
to
get
home
as
soon
as
we
could
and
she
seemed
so
much
better
for
a
while
and
then
everything
seemed
to
happen
at
once
when
we
did
start
home
she
could
not
go
any
farther
than
switzerland
and
in
the
fall
we
went
back
to
italy
we
went
to
sorrento
where
the
climate
seemed
to
do
her
good
but
she
was
growing
frailer
the
whole
time
she
died
in
march
i
found
some
old
friends
of
hers
in
naples
and
came
home
with
the
girl
hesitated
a
little
over
the
words
which
she
nevertheless
uttered
unbroken
while
the
tears
fell
quietly
down
her
face
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
angry
words
that
had
passed
between
her
and
ferris
to
remember
him
only
as
one
who
had
known
her
mother
while
she
went
on
to
relate
some
little
facts
in
the
history
of
her
mother
s
last
days
and
she
rose
into
a
higher
serener
atmosphere
inaccessible
to
his
resentment
or
his
regret
as
she
spoke
of
her
loss
the
simple
tale
of
sickness
and
death
inexpressibly
belittled
his
passionate
woes
and
made
them
look
theatrical
to
him
he
hung
his
head
as
they
turned
at
her
motion
and
walked
away
from
the
picture
of
don
ippolito
and
down
the
stairs
toward
the
the
people
before
the
other
venetian
picture
had
apparently
yielded
to
their
craving
for
lunch
and
had
vanished
i
have
very
little
to
tell
you
of
my
own
life
ferris
began
awkwardly
i
came
home
soon
after
you
started
and
i
went
to
providence
to
find
you
but
you
had
not
got
florida
stopped
him
and
looked
perplexedly
into
his
face
and
then
moved
on
then
i
went
into
the
army
i
wrote
once
to
i
never
got
your
letter
she
said
they
were
now
in
the
lower
hall
and
near
the
door
florida
said
ferris
abruptly
i
m
poor
and
disabled
i
ve
no
more
right
than
any
sick
beggar
in
the
street
to
say
it
to
you
but
i
loved
you
i
must
always
love
you
i
she
halted
him
again
and
you
said
she
grieved
that
you
doubted
me
you
said
that
i
had
made
your
life
a
yes
i
said
that
i
know
it
answered
ferris
you
thought
i
could
be
such
a
false
and
cruel
girl
as
that
yes
yes
i
thought
it
all
god
help
me
when
i
was
only
sorry
for
him
when
it
was
you
that
i
oh
i
know
it
answered
ferris
in
a
heartsick
hopeless
voice
he
knew
it
too
he
told
me
so
the
day
before
he
and
didn
t
you
believe
him
ferris
could
not
answer
do
you
believe
him
now
i
believe
anything
you
tell
me
when
i
look
at
you
i
can
t
believe
i
ever
doubted
why
because
because
i
love
oh
that
s
no
i
know
it
but
i
m
used
to
being
without
a
florida
looked
gravely
at
his
penitent
face
and
a
brave
red
color
mantled
her
own
while
she
advanced
an
unanswerable
argument
then
what
are
you
going
away
for
the
world
seemed
to
melt
and
float
away
from
between
them
it
returned
and
solidified
at
the
sound
of
the
janitor
s
steps
as
he
came
towards
them
on
his
round
through
the
empty
building
ferris
caught
her
hand
she
leaned
heavily
upon
his
arm
as
they
walked
out
into
the
street
it
was
all
they
could
do
at
the
moment
except
to
look
into
each
other
s
faces
and
walk
swiftly
on
at
last
after
how
long
a
time
he
did
not
know
ferris
cried
where
are
we
going
florida
why
i
don
t
know
she
replied
i
m
stopping
with
those
friends
of
ours
at
the
fifth
avenue
hotel
we
going
on
to
providence
we
landed
yesterday
and
we
stayed
to
do
some
shopping
and
may
i
ask
why
you
happened
to
give
your
first
moments
in
america
to
the
fine
arts
the
fine
arts
oh
i
thought
i
might
find
something
of
yours
there
at
the
hotel
she
presented
him
to
her
party
as
a
friend
whom
her
mother
and
she
had
known
in
italy
and
then
went
to
lay
aside
her
hat
the
providence
people
received
him
with
the
easy
warmth
of
manner
which
seems
to
have
floated
northward
as
far
as
their
city
on
the
gulf
stream
bathing
the
rhode
island
shores
the
matron
of
the
party
had
before
florida
came
back
an
outline
history
of
their
acquaintance
which
she
evolved
from
him
with
so
much
tact
that
he
was
not
conscious
of
parting
with
information
and
she
divined
indefinitely
more
when
she
saw
them
together
again
she
was
charming
but
to
ferris
s
thinking
she
had
a
fault
she
kept
him
too
much
from
florida
though
she
talked
of
nothing
else
and
at
the
last
she
was
discreetly
merciful
do
you
think
whispered
florida
very
close
against
his
face
when
they
parted
that
i
ll
have
a
bad
temper
i
hope
you
will
or
i
shall
be
killed
with
kindness
he
replied
she
stood
a
moment
nervously
buttoning
his
coat
across
his
breast
you
mustn
t
let
that
picture
be
sold
henry
she
said
and
by
this
touch
alone
did
she
express
any
sense
if
she
had
it
of
his
want
of
feeling
in
proposing
to
sell
it
he
winced
and
she
added
with
a
soft
pity
in
her
voice
he
did
bring
us
together
after
all
i
wish
you
had
believed
him
dear
so
do
i
said
ferris
most
humbly
people
are
never
equal
to
the
romance
of
their
youth
in
after
life
except
by
fits
and
ferris
especially
could
not
keep
himself
at
what
he
called
the
operatic
pitch
of
their
brief
betrothal
and
the
early
days
of
their
marriage
with
his
help
or
even
his
encouragement
his
wife
might
have
been
able
to
maintain
it
she
had
a
gift
for
idealizing
him
at
least
and
as
his
hurt
healed
but
slowly
and
it
was
a
good
while
before
he
could
paint
with
his
wounded
arm
it
was
an
easy
matter
for
her
to
believe
in
the
meanwhile
that
he
would
have
been
the
greatest
painter
of
his
time
but
for
his
honorable
disability
to
hear
her
you
would
suppose
no
one
else
had
ever
been
shot
in
the
service
of
his
country
it
was
fortunate
for
ferris
since
he
could
not
work
that
she
had
money
in
exalted
moments
he
had
thought
this
a
barrier
to
their
marriage
yet
he
could
not
recall
any
one
who
had
refused
the
hand
of
a
beautiful
girl
because
of
the
accident
of
her
wealth
and
in
the
end
he
silenced
his
scruples
it
might
be
said
that
in
many
other
ways
he
was
not
her
equal
but
one
ought
to
reflect
how
very
few
men
are
worthy
of
their
wives
in
any
sense
after
his
fashion
he
certainly
loved
her
always
even
when
she
tried
him
most
for
it
must
be
owned
that
she
really
had
that
hot
temper
which
he
had
dreaded
in
her
from
the
first
not
that
her
imperiousness
directly
affected
him
for
a
long
time
after
their
marriage
she
seemed
to
have
no
other
desire
than
to
lose
her
outwearied
will
in
his
there
was
something
a
little
pathetic
in
this
there
was
a
kind
of
bewilderment
in
her
gentleness
as
though
the
relaxed
tension
of
her
long
to
her
mother
left
her
without
a
full
motive
she
apparently
found
it
impossible
to
give
herself
with
a
satisfactory
degree
of
abandon
to
a
man
who
could
do
so
many
things
for
himself
when
her
children
came
they
filled
this
vacancy
and
afforded
her
scope
for
the
greatest
excesses
of
ferris
laughed
to
find
her
protecting
them
and
serving
them
with
the
same
tigerish
tenderness
the
same
haughty
humility
as
that
with
which
she
used
to
care
for
poor
vervain
and
he
perceived
that
this
was
merely
the
direction
away
from
herself
of
that
intense
arrogance
of
nature
which
but
for
her
power
and
need
of
loving
would
have
made
her
intolerable
what
she
chiefly
exacted
from
them
in
return
for
her
fierce
devotedness
was
the
truth
in
everything
she
was
content
that
they
should
be
rather
less
fond
of
her
than
of
their
father
whom
indeed
they
found
much
more
amusing
the
ferrises
went
to
europe
some
years
after
their
marriage
revisiting
venice
but
sojourning
for
the
most
part
in
florence
ferris
had
once
imagined
that
the
tragedy
which
had
given
him
his
wife
would
always
invest
her
with
the
shadow
of
its
sadness
but
in
this
he
was
mistaken
there
is
nothing
has
really
so
strong
a
digestion
as
love
and
this
is
very
lucky
seeing
what
manifold
experiences
love
has
to
swallow
and
assimilate
and
when
they
got
back
to
venice
ferris
found
that
the
customs
of
their
joint
life
exorcised
all
the
dark
associations
of
the
place
these
simply
formed
a
sombre
background
against
which
their
wedded
happiness
relieved
itself
they
talked
much
of
the
past
with
free
minds
unashamed
and
unafraid
if
it
is
a
little
shocking
it
is
nevertheless
true
and
true
to
human
nature
that
they
spoke
of
don
ippolito
as
if
he
were
a
part
of
their
love
ferris
had
never
ceased
to
wonder
at
what
he
called
the
unfathomable
innocence
of
his
wife
and
he
liked
to
go
over
all
the
points
of
their
former
life
in
venice
and
bring
home
to
himself
the
utter
simplicity
of
her
girlish
ideas
motives
and
designs
which
both
confounded
and
delighted
him
it
s
amazing
florida
he
would
say
it
s
perfectly
amazing
that
you
should
have
been
willing
to
undertake
the
job
of
importing
into
america
that
poor
fellow
with
his
whole
stock
of
helplessness
dreamery
and
unpracticality
what
you
about
why
i
ve
often
told
you
henry
i
thought
he
oughtn
t
to
continue
a
yes
yes
i
then
he
would
remain
lost
in
thought
softly
whistling
to
himself
on
one
of
these
occasions
he
asked
do
you
think
he
was
really
very
much
troubled
by
his
false
position
i
can
t
tell
now
he
seemed
to
be
that
story
he
told
you
of
his
childhood
and
of
how
he
became
a
priest
didn
t
it
strike
you
at
the
time
like
rather
a
melodramatic
history
no
no
how
can
you
say
such
things
henry
it
was
too
simple
not
to
be
well
well
perhaps
so
but
he
baffles
me
he
always
did
for
that
then
came
another
pause
while
ferris
lay
back
upon
the
gondola
cushions
getting
the
level
of
the
lido
just
under
his
do
you
think
he
was
very
much
of
a
skeptic
after
all
florida
ferris
turned
her
eyes
reproachfully
upon
her
husband
why
henry
how
strange
you
are
you
said
yourself
once
that
you
used
to
wonder
if
he
were
not
a
yes
i
know
but
for
a
man
who
had
lived
in
doubt
so
many
years
he
certainly
slipped
back
into
the
bosom
of
mother
church
pretty
suddenly
don
t
you
think
he
was
a
person
of
rather
light
feelings
i
can
t
talk
with
you
my
dear
if
you
go
on
in
that
i
don
t
mean
any
harm
i
can
see
how
in
many
things
he
was
the
soul
of
truth
and
honor
but
it
seems
to
me
that
even
the
life
he
lived
was
largely
imagined
i
mean
that
he
was
such
a
dreamer
that
once
having
fancied
himself
afflicted
at
being
what
he
was
he
could
go
on
and
suffer
as
keenly
as
if
he
really
were
troubled
by
it
why
mightn
t
it
be
that
all
his
doubts
came
from
anger
and
resentment
towards
those
who
made
him
a
priest
rather
than
from
any
examination
of
his
own
mind
i
don
t
say
it
so
but
i
don
t
believe
he
knew
quite
what
he
wanted
he
must
have
felt
that
his
failure
as
an
inventor
went
deeper
than
the
failure
of
his
particular
attempts
i
once
thought
that
perhaps
he
had
a
genius
in
that
way
but
i
question
now
whether
he
had
if
he
had
it
seems
to
me
he
had
opportunity
to
prove
it
certainly
as
a
priest
he
had
leisure
to
prove
it
but
when
that
sort
of
subconsciousness
of
his
own
inadequacy
came
over
him
it
was
perfectly
natural
for
him
to
take
refuge
in
the
supposition
that
he
had
been
baffled
by
ferris
remained
silently
troubled
i
don
t
know
how
to
answer
you
henry
but
i
think
that
you
re
judging
him
narrowly
and
not
harshly
i
feel
very
compassionate
towards
him
but
now
even
as
to
what
one
might
consider
the
most
real
thing
in
his
life
his
caring
for
you
it
seems
to
me
there
must
have
been
a
great
share
of
imagined
sentiment
in
it
it
was
not
a
passion
it
was
a
gentle
nature
s
dream
of
a
he
didn
t
die
of
a
dream
said
the
wife
no
he
died
of
a
he
had
got
well
of
the
that
s
very
true
my
dear
and
whatever
his
head
was
he
had
an
affectionate
and
faithful
heart
i
wish
i
had
been
gentler
with
him
i
must
often
have
bruised
that
sensitive
soul
god
knows
i
m
sorry
for
it
but
he
s
a
puzzle
he
s
a
puzzle
thus
lapsing
more
and
more
into
a
mere
problem
as
the
years
have
passed
don
ippolito
has
at
last
ceased
to
be
even
the
memory
of
a
man
with
a
passionate
love
and
a
mortal
sorrow
perhaps
this
final
effect
in
the
mind
of
him
who
has
realized
the
happiness
of
which
the
poor
priest
vainly
dreamed
is
not
the
least
tragic
phase
of
the
tragedy
of
don
ippolito
