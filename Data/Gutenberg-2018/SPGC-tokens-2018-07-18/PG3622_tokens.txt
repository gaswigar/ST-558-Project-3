when
the
duchess
was
dead
no
one
probably
ever
felt
himself
to
be
more
alone
in
the
world
than
our
old
friend
the
duke
of
omnium
when
the
duchess
died
when
this
sad
event
happened
he
had
ceased
to
be
prime
minister
during
the
first
nine
months
after
he
had
left
office
he
and
the
duchess
remained
in
england
then
they
had
gone
abroad
taking
with
them
their
three
children
the
eldest
lord
silverbridge
had
been
at
oxford
but
had
had
his
career
there
cut
short
by
some
more
than
ordinary
youthful
folly
which
had
induced
his
father
to
agree
with
the
college
authorities
that
his
name
had
better
be
taken
off
the
college
books
all
which
had
been
cause
of
very
great
sorrow
to
the
duke
the
other
boy
was
to
go
to
cambridge
but
his
father
had
thought
it
well
to
give
him
a
twelvemonth
run
on
the
continent
under
his
own
inspection
lady
mary
the
only
daughter
was
the
youngest
of
the
family
and
she
also
had
been
with
them
on
the
continent
they
remained
the
full
year
abroad
travelling
with
a
large
accompaniment
of
tutors
couriers
and
sometimes
friends
i
do
not
know
that
the
duchess
or
the
duke
had
enjoyed
it
much
but
the
young
people
had
seen
something
of
foreign
courts
and
much
of
foreign
scenery
and
had
perhaps
perfected
their
french
the
duke
had
gone
to
work
at
his
travels
with
a
full
determination
to
create
for
himself
occupation
out
of
a
new
kind
of
life
he
had
studied
dante
and
had
striven
to
arouse
himself
to
ecstatic
joy
amidst
the
loveliness
of
the
italian
lakes
but
through
it
all
he
had
been
aware
that
he
had
failed
the
duchess
had
made
no
such
resolution
had
hardly
perhaps
made
any
attempt
but
in
truth
they
had
both
sighed
to
be
back
among
the
they
had
both
suffered
much
among
the
trumpets
and
yet
they
longed
to
return
he
told
himself
from
day
to
day
that
though
he
had
been
banished
from
the
house
of
commons
still
as
a
peer
he
had
a
seat
in
parliament
and
that
though
he
was
no
longer
a
minister
still
he
might
be
useful
as
a
legislator
she
in
her
career
as
a
leader
of
fashion
had
no
doubt
met
with
some
trouble
with
some
trouble
but
with
no
disgrace
and
as
she
had
been
carried
about
among
the
lakes
and
mountains
among
the
pictures
and
statues
among
the
counts
and
countesses
she
had
often
felt
that
there
was
no
happiness
except
in
that
dominion
which
circumstances
had
enabled
her
to
achieve
once
and
might
enable
her
to
achieve
again
in
the
realms
of
london
society
then
in
the
early
spring
of
they
came
back
to
england
having
persistently
carried
out
their
project
at
any
rate
in
regard
to
time
lord
gerald
the
younger
son
was
at
once
sent
up
to
trinity
for
the
eldest
son
a
seat
was
to
be
found
in
the
house
of
commons
and
the
fact
that
a
dissolution
of
parliament
was
expected
served
to
prevent
any
prolonged
sojourn
abroad
lady
mary
palliser
was
at
that
time
nineteen
and
her
entrance
into
the
world
was
to
be
her
great
care
and
great
delight
in
march
they
spent
a
few
days
in
london
and
then
went
down
to
matching
priory
when
she
left
town
the
duchess
was
complaining
of
cold
sore
throat
and
debility
a
week
after
their
arrival
at
matching
she
was
dead
had
the
heavens
fallen
and
mixed
themselves
with
the
earth
had
the
people
of
london
risen
in
rebellion
with
french
ideas
of
equality
had
the
queen
persistently
declined
to
comply
with
the
constitutional
advice
of
her
ministers
had
a
majority
in
the
house
of
commons
lost
its
influence
in
the
country
the
utter
prostration
of
the
bereft
husband
could
not
have
been
more
complete
it
was
not
only
that
his
heart
was
torn
to
pieces
but
that
he
did
not
know
how
to
look
out
into
the
world
it
was
as
though
a
man
should
be
suddenly
called
upon
to
live
without
hands
or
even
arms
he
was
helpless
and
knew
himself
to
be
helpless
hitherto
he
had
never
specially
acknowledged
to
himself
that
his
wife
was
necessary
to
him
as
a
component
part
of
his
life
though
he
had
loved
her
dearly
and
had
in
all
things
consulted
her
welfare
and
happiness
he
had
at
times
been
inclined
to
think
that
in
the
exuberance
of
her
spirits
she
had
been
a
trouble
rather
than
a
support
to
him
but
now
it
was
as
though
all
outside
appliances
were
taken
away
from
him
there
was
no
one
of
whom
he
could
ask
a
question
for
it
may
be
said
of
this
man
that
though
throughout
his
life
he
had
had
many
honourable
and
right
honourable
friends
and
that
though
he
had
entertained
guests
by
the
score
and
though
he
had
achieved
for
himself
the
respect
of
all
good
men
and
the
thorough
admiration
of
some
few
who
knew
him
he
had
hardly
made
for
himself
a
single
intimate
friend
except
that
one
who
had
now
passed
away
from
him
to
her
he
had
been
able
to
say
what
he
thought
even
though
she
would
occasionally
ridicule
him
while
he
was
declaring
his
feelings
but
there
had
been
no
other
human
soul
to
whom
he
could
open
himself
there
were
one
or
two
whom
he
loved
and
perhaps
liked
but
his
loving
and
his
liking
had
been
exclusively
political
he
had
so
habituated
himself
to
devote
his
mind
and
his
heart
to
the
service
of
his
country
that
he
had
almost
risen
above
or
sunk
below
humanity
but
she
who
had
been
essentially
human
had
been
a
link
between
him
and
the
world
there
were
his
three
children
the
youngest
of
whom
was
now
nearly
nineteen
and
they
surely
were
links
at
the
first
moment
of
his
bereavement
they
were
felt
to
be
hardly
more
than
burdens
a
more
loving
father
there
was
not
in
england
but
nature
had
made
him
so
undemonstrative
that
as
yet
they
had
hardly
known
his
love
in
all
their
joys
and
in
all
their
troubles
in
all
their
desires
and
all
their
disappointments
they
had
ever
gone
to
their
mother
she
had
been
conversant
with
everything
about
them
from
the
boys
bills
and
the
girl
gloves
to
the
innermost
turn
in
the
heart
and
the
disposition
of
each
she
had
known
with
the
utmost
accuracy
the
nature
of
the
scrapes
into
which
lord
silverbridge
had
precipitated
himself
and
had
known
also
how
probable
it
was
that
lord
gerald
would
do
the
same
the
results
of
such
scrapes
she
of
course
deplored
and
therefore
she
would
give
good
counsel
pointing
out
how
imperative
it
was
that
such
should
be
avoided
but
with
the
spirit
that
produced
the
scrapes
she
fully
sympathised
the
father
disliked
the
spirit
almost
worse
than
the
results
and
was
therefore
often
irritated
and
unhappy
and
the
difficulties
about
the
girl
were
almost
worse
to
bear
than
those
about
the
boys
she
had
done
nothing
wrong
she
had
given
no
signs
of
extravagance
or
other
juvenile
misconduct
but
she
was
beautiful
and
young
how
was
he
to
bring
her
out
into
the
world
how
was
he
to
decide
whom
she
should
or
whom
she
should
not
marry
how
was
he
to
guide
her
through
the
shoals
and
rocks
which
lay
in
the
path
of
such
a
girl
before
she
can
achieve
matrimony
it
was
the
fate
of
the
family
that
with
a
world
of
acquaintance
they
had
not
many
friends
from
all
close
connection
with
relatives
on
the
side
of
the
duchess
they
had
been
dissevered
by
old
feelings
at
first
and
afterwards
by
want
of
any
similitude
in
the
habits
of
life
she
had
when
young
been
repressed
by
male
and
female
guardians
with
an
iron
hand
such
repression
had
been
needed
and
had
been
perhaps
salutary
but
it
had
not
left
behind
it
much
affection
and
then
her
nearest
relatives
were
not
sympathetic
with
the
duke
he
could
obtain
no
assistance
in
the
care
of
his
girl
from
that
source
nor
could
he
even
do
it
from
his
own
cousins
wives
who
were
his
nearest
connections
on
the
side
of
the
pallisers
they
were
women
to
whom
he
had
ever
been
kind
but
to
whom
he
had
never
opened
his
heart
when
in
the
midst
of
the
stunning
sorrow
of
the
first
week
he
tried
to
think
of
all
this
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
nobody
there
had
been
one
lady
a
very
dear
ally
staying
in
the
house
with
them
when
the
duchess
died
this
was
finn
the
wife
of
phineas
finn
who
had
been
one
of
the
duke
colleagues
when
in
office
how
it
had
come
to
pass
that
finn
and
the
duchess
had
become
singularly
bound
together
has
been
told
elsewhere
but
there
had
been
close
bonds
so
close
that
when
the
duchess
on
their
return
from
the
continent
had
passed
through
london
on
her
way
to
matching
ill
at
the
time
and
very
comfortless
it
had
been
almost
a
thing
of
course
that
finn
should
go
with
her
and
as
she
had
sunk
and
then
despaired
and
then
died
it
was
this
woman
who
had
always
been
at
her
side
who
had
ministered
to
her
and
had
listened
to
the
fears
and
the
wishes
and
hopes
she
had
expressed
respecting
the
children
at
matching
amidst
the
ruins
of
the
old
priory
there
is
a
parish
and
there
in
accordance
with
her
own
wish
almost
within
sight
of
her
own
she
was
buried
on
the
day
of
the
funeral
a
dozen
relatives
came
pallisers
and
who
on
such
an
occasion
were
bound
to
show
themselves
as
members
of
the
family
with
them
and
his
two
sons
the
duke
walked
across
to
the
graveyard
and
then
walked
back
but
even
to
those
who
stayed
the
night
at
the
house
he
hardly
spoke
by
noon
on
the
following
day
they
had
all
left
him
and
the
only
stranger
in
the
house
was
finn
on
the
afternoon
of
the
day
after
the
funeral
the
duke
and
his
guest
met
almost
for
the
first
time
since
the
sad
event
there
had
been
just
a
pressure
of
the
hand
just
a
glance
of
compassion
just
some
murmur
of
deep
sorrow
but
there
had
been
no
real
speech
between
them
now
he
had
sent
for
her
and
she
went
down
to
him
in
the
room
in
which
he
commonly
sat
at
work
he
was
seated
at
his
table
when
she
entered
but
there
was
no
book
open
before
him
and
no
pen
ready
to
his
hand
he
was
dressed
of
course
in
black
that
indeed
was
usual
with
him
but
now
the
tailor
by
his
funereal
art
had
added
some
deeper
dye
of
blackness
to
his
appearance
when
he
rose
and
turned
to
her
she
thought
that
he
had
at
once
become
an
old
man
his
hair
was
grey
in
parts
and
he
had
never
accustomed
himself
to
use
that
skill
in
managing
his
outside
person
by
which
many
men
are
able
to
preserve
for
themselves
a
look
if
not
of
youth
at
any
rate
of
freshness
he
was
thin
of
an
adust
complexion
and
had
acquired
a
habit
of
stooping
which
when
he
was
not
excited
gave
him
an
appearance
of
age
all
that
was
common
to
him
but
now
it
was
so
much
exaggerated
that
he
who
was
not
yet
fifty
might
have
been
taken
to
be
over
sixty
he
put
out
his
hand
to
greet
her
as
she
came
up
to
him
silverbridge
he
said
tells
me
that
you
go
back
to
london
i
thought
it
would
be
best
duke
my
presence
here
can
be
of
no
comfort
to
you
i
will
not
say
that
anything
can
be
of
comfort
but
of
course
it
is
right
that
you
should
go
i
can
have
no
excuse
for
asking
you
to
remain
while
there
was
yet
a
hope
for
her
then
he
stopped
unable
to
say
a
word
further
in
that
direction
and
yet
there
was
no
sign
of
a
tear
and
no
sound
of
a
sob
of
course
i
would
stay
duke
if
i
could
be
of
any
service
finn
will
expect
you
to
return
to
him
perhaps
it
would
be
better
that
i
should
say
that
i
would
stay
were
it
not
that
i
know
that
i
can
be
of
no
real
service
what
do
you
mean
by
that
mrs
finn
lady
mary
should
have
with
her
at
such
a
time
some
other
friend
there
was
none
other
whom
her
mother
loved
as
she
loved
you
none
none
this
he
said
almost
with
energy
there
was
no
one
lately
duke
with
whom
circumstances
caused
her
mother
to
be
so
closely
intimate
but
even
that
perhaps
was
unfortunate
i
never
thought
so
that
is
a
great
compliment
but
as
to
lady
mary
will
it
not
be
as
well
that
she
should
have
with
her
as
soon
as
possible
someone
perhaps
someone
of
her
own
kindred
if
it
be
possible
or
if
not
that
at
least
one
of
her
own
kind
who
is
there
whom
do
you
mean
i
mean
no
one
it
is
hard
duke
to
say
what
i
do
mean
but
perhaps
i
had
better
try
there
will
be
probably
there
have
been
some
among
your
friends
who
have
regretted
the
great
intimacy
which
chance
produced
between
me
and
my
lost
friend
while
she
was
with
us
no
such
feeling
would
have
sufficed
to
drive
me
from
her
she
had
chosen
for
herself
and
if
others
disapproved
her
choice
that
was
nothing
to
me
but
as
regards
lady
mary
it
will
be
better
i
think
that
from
the
beginning
she
should
be
taught
to
look
for
friendship
and
guidance
to
those
to
those
who
are
more
naturally
connected
with
her
i
was
not
thinking
of
any
guidance
said
the
duke
of
course
not
but
with
one
so
young
where
there
is
intimacy
there
will
be
guidance
there
should
be
somebody
with
her
it
was
almost
the
last
thought
that
occupied
her
mother
mind
i
could
not
tell
her
duke
but
i
can
tell
you
that
i
can
not
with
advantage
to
your
girl
be
that
somebody
cora
wished
it
her
wishes
probably
were
sudden
and
hardly
fixed
who
should
it
be
then
asked
the
father
after
a
pause
who
am
i
duke
that
i
should
answer
such
a
question
after
that
there
was
another
pause
and
then
the
conference
was
ended
by
a
request
from
the
duke
that
finn
would
stay
at
matching
for
yet
two
days
longer
at
dinner
they
all
met
the
father
the
three
children
and
finn
how
far
the
young
people
among
themselves
had
been
able
to
throw
off
something
of
the
gloom
of
death
need
not
here
be
asked
but
in
the
presence
of
their
father
they
were
sad
and
sombre
almost
as
he
was
on
the
next
day
early
in
the
morning
the
younger
lad
returned
to
his
college
and
lord
silverbridge
went
up
to
london
where
he
was
supposed
to
have
his
home
perhaps
you
would
not
mind
reading
these
letters
the
duke
said
to
finn
when
she
again
went
to
him
in
compliance
with
a
message
from
him
asking
for
her
presence
then
she
sat
down
and
read
two
letters
one
from
lady
cantrip
and
the
other
from
a
jeffrey
palliser
each
of
which
contained
an
invitation
for
his
daughter
and
expressed
a
hope
that
lady
mary
would
not
be
unwilling
to
spend
some
time
with
the
writer
lady
cantrip
letter
was
long
and
went
minutely
into
circumstances
if
lady
mary
would
come
to
her
she
would
abstain
from
having
other
company
in
the
house
till
her
young
friend
spirits
should
have
somewhat
recovered
themselves
nothing
could
be
more
kind
or
proposed
in
a
sweeter
fashion
there
had
however
been
present
to
the
duke
mind
as
he
read
it
a
feeling
that
a
proposition
to
a
bereaved
husband
to
relieve
him
of
the
society
of
an
only
daughter
was
not
one
which
would
usually
be
made
to
a
father
in
such
a
position
a
child
company
would
probably
be
his
best
solace
but
he
knew
at
this
moment
he
painfully
remembered
that
he
was
not
as
are
other
men
he
acknowledged
the
truth
of
this
but
he
was
not
the
less
grieved
and
irritated
by
the
reminder
the
letter
from
jeffrey
palliser
was
to
the
same
effect
but
was
much
shorter
if
it
would
suit
mary
to
come
to
them
for
a
month
or
six
weeks
at
their
place
in
gloucestershire
they
would
both
be
delighted
i
should
not
choose
her
to
go
there
said
the
duke
as
finn
refolded
the
latter
letter
my
cousin
wife
is
a
very
good
woman
but
mary
would
not
be
happy
with
her
lady
cantrip
is
an
excellent
friend
for
her
excellent
i
know
no
one
whom
i
esteem
more
than
lady
cantrip
would
you
wish
her
to
go
there
duke
there
came
a
wistful
piteous
look
over
the
father
face
why
should
he
be
treated
as
no
other
father
would
be
treated
why
should
it
be
supposed
that
he
would
desire
to
send
his
girl
away
from
him
but
yet
he
felt
that
it
would
be
better
that
she
should
go
it
was
his
present
purpose
to
remain
at
matching
through
a
portion
of
the
summer
what
could
he
do
to
make
a
girl
happy
what
comfort
would
there
be
in
his
companionship
i
suppose
she
ought
to
go
somewhere
he
said
i
had
not
thought
of
it
said
finn
i
understood
you
to
say
replied
the
duke
almost
angrily
that
she
ought
to
go
to
someone
who
would
take
care
of
her
i
was
thinking
of
some
friend
coming
to
her
who
would
come
who
is
there
that
i
could
possibly
ask
you
will
not
stay
i
certainly
would
stay
if
it
were
for
her
good
i
was
thinking
duke
that
perhaps
you
might
ask
the
greys
to
come
to
you
they
would
not
come
he
said
after
a
pause
when
she
was
told
that
it
was
for
her
sake
she
would
come
i
think
then
there
was
another
pause
i
could
not
ask
them
he
said
for
his
sake
i
could
not
have
it
put
to
her
in
that
way
perhaps
mary
had
better
go
to
lady
cantrip
perhaps
i
had
better
be
alone
here
for
a
time
i
do
not
think
that
i
am
fit
to
have
any
human
being
here
with
me
in
my
sorrow
chapter
ii
lady
mary
palliser
it
may
as
well
be
said
at
once
that
finn
knew
something
of
lady
mary
which
was
not
known
to
the
father
and
which
she
was
not
yet
prepared
to
make
known
to
him
the
last
winter
abroad
had
been
passed
at
rome
and
there
lady
mary
palliser
had
become
acquainted
with
a
certain
tregear
francis
oliphant
tregear
the
duchess
who
had
been
in
constant
correspondence
with
her
friend
had
asked
questions
by
letter
as
to
tregear
of
whom
she
had
only
known
that
he
was
the
younger
son
of
a
cornish
gentleman
who
had
become
lord
silverbridge
friend
at
oxford
in
this
there
had
certainly
been
but
little
to
recommend
him
to
the
intimacy
of
such
a
girl
as
lady
mary
palliser
nor
had
the
duchess
when
writing
ever
spoken
of
him
as
a
probable
suitor
for
her
daughter
hand
she
had
never
connected
the
two
names
together
but
finn
had
been
clever
enough
to
perceive
that
the
duchess
had
become
fond
of
tregear
and
would
willingly
have
heard
something
to
his
advantage
and
she
did
hear
something
to
his
advantage
something
also
to
his
disadvantage
at
his
death
this
young
man
would
inherit
a
property
amounting
to
about
fifteen
hundred
a
year
and
i
am
told
said
finn
that
he
is
quite
likely
to
spend
his
money
before
it
comes
to
him
there
had
been
nothing
more
written
specially
about
tregear
but
finn
had
feared
not
only
that
the
young
man
loved
the
girl
but
that
the
young
man
love
had
in
some
imprudent
way
been
fostered
by
the
mother
then
there
had
been
some
fitful
confidence
during
those
few
days
of
acute
illness
why
should
not
the
girl
have
the
man
if
he
were
lovable
and
the
duchess
referred
to
her
own
early
days
when
she
had
loved
and
to
the
great
ruin
which
had
come
upon
her
heart
when
she
had
been
severed
from
the
man
she
had
loved
not
but
that
it
has
been
all
for
the
best
she
had
said
not
but
that
plantagenet
has
been
to
me
all
that
a
husband
should
be
only
if
she
can
be
spared
what
i
suffered
let
her
be
spared
even
when
these
things
had
been
said
to
her
finn
had
found
herself
unable
to
ask
questions
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
inquire
whether
the
girl
had
in
truth
given
her
heart
to
this
young
tregear
the
one
was
nineteen
and
the
other
as
yet
but
but
though
she
asked
no
questions
she
almost
knew
that
it
must
be
so
and
she
knew
also
that
the
father
as
yet
was
quite
in
the
dark
on
the
matter
how
was
it
possible
that
in
such
circumstances
she
should
assume
the
part
of
the
girl
confidential
friend
and
monitress
were
she
to
do
so
she
must
immediately
tell
the
father
everything
in
such
a
position
no
one
could
be
a
better
friend
than
lady
cantrip
and
finn
had
already
almost
made
up
her
mind
that
should
lady
cantrip
occupy
the
place
she
would
tell
her
ladyship
all
that
had
passed
between
herself
and
the
duchess
on
the
subject
of
what
hopes
she
might
have
or
what
fears
about
her
girl
the
duchess
had
said
no
word
to
her
husband
but
when
she
had
believed
that
the
things
of
the
world
were
fading
away
from
her
and
when
he
was
sitting
by
her
bedside
dumb
because
at
such
a
moment
he
knew
not
how
to
express
the
tenderness
of
his
heart
holding
her
hand
and
trying
so
to
listen
to
her
words
that
he
might
collect
and
remember
every
wish
she
had
murmured
something
about
the
ultimate
division
of
the
great
wealth
with
which
she
herself
had
been
endowed
she
had
never
she
said
even
tried
to
remember
what
arrangements
had
been
made
by
lawyers
but
she
hoped
that
mary
might
be
so
circumstanced
that
if
her
happiness
depended
on
marrying
a
poor
man
want
of
money
need
not
prevent
it
the
duke
suspecting
nothing
believing
this
to
be
a
not
unnatural
expression
of
maternal
interest
had
assured
her
that
mary
fortune
would
be
ample
finn
made
the
proposition
to
lady
mary
in
respect
to
lady
cantrip
invitation
lady
mary
was
very
like
her
mother
especially
in
having
exactly
her
mother
tone
of
voice
her
quick
manner
of
speech
and
her
sharp
intelligence
she
had
also
her
mother
eyes
large
and
round
and
almost
blue
full
of
life
and
full
of
courage
eyes
which
never
seemed
to
quail
and
her
mother
dark
brown
hair
never
long
but
very
copious
in
its
thickness
she
was
however
taller
than
her
mother
and
very
much
more
graceful
in
her
movement
and
she
could
already
assume
a
personal
dignity
of
manner
which
had
never
been
within
her
mother
reach
she
had
become
aware
of
a
certain
brusqueness
of
speech
in
her
mother
a
certain
aptitude
to
say
sharp
things
without
thinking
whether
the
sharpness
was
becoming
to
the
position
which
she
held
and
taking
advantage
of
the
example
the
girl
had
already
learned
that
she
might
gain
more
than
she
would
lose
by
controlling
her
words
papa
wants
me
to
go
to
lady
cantrip
she
said
i
think
he
would
like
it
just
for
the
present
lady
mary
though
there
had
been
the
closest
possible
intimacy
between
the
duchess
and
finn
this
had
hardly
been
so
as
to
the
intercourse
between
finn
and
the
children
of
finn
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
she
was
perhaps
fastidiously
afraid
of
appearing
to
take
advantage
of
her
friendship
with
the
duke
family
she
would
tell
herself
that
though
circumstances
had
compelled
her
to
be
the
closest
and
nearest
friend
of
a
duchess
still
her
natural
place
was
not
among
dukes
and
their
children
and
therefore
in
her
intercourse
with
the
girl
she
did
not
at
first
assume
the
manner
and
bearing
which
her
position
in
the
house
would
have
seemed
to
warrant
hence
the
lady
mary
why
does
he
want
to
send
me
away
mrs
finn
it
is
not
that
he
wants
to
send
you
away
but
that
he
thinks
it
will
be
better
for
you
to
be
with
some
friend
here
you
must
be
so
much
alone
why
do
you
stay
but
i
suppose
finn
wants
you
to
be
back
in
london
it
is
not
that
only
or
to
speak
the
truth
not
that
at
all
finn
could
come
here
if
it
were
suitable
or
for
a
week
or
two
he
might
do
very
well
without
me
but
there
are
other
reasons
there
is
no
one
whom
your
mother
respected
more
highly
than
lady
cantrip
i
never
heard
her
speak
a
word
of
lady
cantrip
both
he
and
she
are
your
father
intimate
friends
does
papa
want
to
be
alone
here
it
is
you
not
himself
of
whom
he
is
thinking
therefore
i
must
think
of
him
finn
i
do
not
wish
him
to
be
alone
i
am
sure
it
would
be
better
that
i
should
stay
with
him
he
feels
that
it
would
not
be
well
that
you
should
live
without
the
companionship
of
some
lady
then
let
him
find
some
lady
you
would
be
the
best
because
he
knows
you
so
well
i
however
am
not
afraid
of
being
alone
i
am
sure
he
ought
not
to
be
here
quite
by
himself
if
he
bids
me
go
i
must
go
and
then
of
course
i
shall
go
where
he
sends
me
but
i
wo
say
that
i
think
it
best
that
i
should
go
and
certainly
i
do
not
want
to
go
to
lady
cantrip
this
she
said
with
great
decision
as
though
the
matter
was
one
on
which
she
had
altogether
made
up
her
mind
then
she
added
in
a
lower
voice
why
does
papa
speak
to
me
about
it
he
is
thinking
only
of
what
may
be
best
for
you
it
would
be
best
for
me
to
stay
near
him
whom
else
has
he
got
all
this
finn
repeated
to
the
duke
as
closely
as
she
could
and
then
of
course
the
father
was
obliged
to
speak
to
his
daughter
do
send
me
away
papa
she
said
at
once
your
life
here
mary
will
be
inexpressibly
sad
it
must
be
sad
anywhere
i
can
not
go
to
college
like
gerald
or
live
anywhere
just
as
i
please
like
silverbridge
do
you
envy
them
that
sometimes
papa
only
i
shall
think
more
of
poor
mamma
by
being
alone
and
i
should
like
to
be
thinking
of
her
always
he
shook
his
head
mournfully
i
do
not
mean
that
i
shall
always
be
unhappy
as
i
am
now
no
my
dear
you
are
too
young
for
that
it
is
only
the
old
who
suffer
in
that
way
you
will
suffer
less
if
i
am
with
you
wo
you
papa
i
do
not
want
to
go
to
lady
cantrip
i
hardly
remember
her
at
all
she
is
very
good
oh
yes
that
is
what
they
used
to
say
to
mamma
about
lady
midlothian
papa
pray
do
not
send
me
to
lady
cantrip
of
course
it
was
decided
that
she
should
not
go
to
lady
cantrip
at
once
or
to
jeffrey
palliser
and
after
a
short
interval
of
doubt
it
was
decided
also
that
finn
should
remain
at
matching
for
at
least
a
fortnight
the
duke
declared
that
he
would
be
glad
to
see
finn
but
she
knew
that
in
his
present
mood
the
society
of
any
one
man
to
whom
he
would
feel
himself
called
upon
to
devote
his
time
would
be
a
burden
to
him
and
she
plainly
said
that
finn
had
better
not
come
to
matching
at
present
there
are
old
associations
she
said
which
will
enable
you
to
bear
with
me
as
you
will
with
your
butler
or
your
groom
but
you
are
not
as
yet
quite
able
to
make
yourself
happy
with
company
this
he
bore
with
perfect
equanimity
and
then
as
it
were
handed
over
his
daughter
to
finn
care
very
quickly
there
came
to
be
close
intimacy
between
finn
and
lady
mary
for
a
day
or
two
the
elder
woman
though
the
place
she
filled
was
one
of
absolute
confidence
rather
resisted
than
encouraged
the
intimacy
she
always
remembered
that
the
girl
was
the
daughter
of
a
great
duke
and
that
her
position
in
the
house
had
sprung
from
circumstances
which
would
not
perhaps
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
at
large
have
recommended
her
for
such
friendship
she
knew
the
reader
may
possibly
know
that
nothing
had
ever
been
purer
nothing
more
disinterested
than
her
friendship
but
she
knew
also
no
one
knew
better
that
the
judgment
of
men
and
women
does
not
always
run
parallel
with
facts
she
entertained
too
a
conviction
in
regard
to
herself
that
hard
words
and
hard
judgments
were
to
be
expected
from
the
world
were
to
be
accepted
by
her
without
any
strong
feeling
of
injustice
because
she
had
been
elevated
by
chance
to
the
possession
of
more
good
things
than
she
had
merited
she
weighed
all
this
with
a
very
fine
balance
and
even
after
the
encouragement
she
had
received
from
the
duke
was
intent
on
confining
herself
to
some
position
about
the
girl
inferior
to
that
which
such
a
friend
as
lady
cantrip
might
have
occupied
but
the
girl
manner
and
the
girl
speech
about
her
own
mother
overcame
her
it
was
the
unintentional
revelation
of
the
duchess
constant
reference
to
her
the
way
in
which
lady
mary
would
assert
that
mamma
used
always
to
say
this
of
you
mamma
always
knew
that
you
would
think
so
and
so
mamma
used
to
say
that
you
had
told
her
it
was
the
feeling
thus
conveyed
that
the
mother
who
was
now
dead
had
in
her
daily
dealings
with
her
own
child
spoken
of
her
as
her
nearest
friend
which
mainly
served
to
conquer
the
deference
of
manner
which
she
had
assumed
then
gradually
there
came
confidences
and
at
last
absolute
confidence
the
whole
story
about
tregear
was
told
yes
she
loved
tregear
she
had
given
him
her
heart
and
had
told
him
so
then
my
dear
your
father
ought
to
know
it
said
finn
no
not
yet
mamma
knew
it
did
she
know
all
that
you
have
told
me
yes
all
and
tregear
spoke
to
her
and
she
said
that
papa
ought
not
to
be
told
quite
yet
finn
could
not
but
remember
that
the
friend
she
had
lost
was
not
among
women
the
one
best
able
to
give
a
girl
good
counsel
in
such
a
crisis
why
not
yet
dear
well
because
it
is
very
hard
to
explain
in
the
first
place
because
tregear
himself
does
not
wish
it
that
is
a
very
bad
reason
the
worst
in
the
world
of
course
you
will
say
so
of
course
everybody
would
say
so
but
when
there
is
one
person
whom
one
loves
better
than
all
the
rest
for
whom
one
would
be
ready
to
die
to
whom
one
is
determined
that
everything
shall
be
devoted
surely
the
wishes
of
a
person
so
dear
as
that
ought
to
have
weight
not
in
persuading
you
to
do
that
which
is
acknowledged
to
be
wrong
what
wrong
i
am
going
to
do
nothing
wrong
the
very
concealment
of
your
love
is
wrong
after
that
love
has
been
not
only
given
but
declared
a
girl
position
in
such
matters
is
so
delicate
especially
that
of
such
a
girl
as
you
i
know
all
about
that
said
lady
mary
with
something
almost
approaching
to
scorn
in
her
tone
of
course
i
have
to
be
delicate
i
do
quite
know
what
the
word
means
i
am
not
a
bit
ashamed
of
being
in
love
with
tregear
he
is
a
gentleman
highly
educated
very
clever
of
an
old
family
older
i
believe
than
papa
and
he
is
manly
and
handsome
just
what
a
young
man
ought
to
be
only
he
is
not
rich
if
he
be
all
that
you
say
ought
you
not
to
trust
your
papa
if
he
approve
of
it
he
could
give
you
money
of
course
he
must
be
told
but
not
now
he
is
nearly
about
dear
mamma
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
care
about
anything
of
that
kind
at
present
and
then
it
is
tregear
that
should
speak
to
him
first
not
now
mary
how
do
you
mean
not
now
if
you
had
a
mother
you
would
talk
to
her
about
it
mamma
knew
if
she
were
still
living
she
would
tell
your
father
but
she
did
tell
him
though
she
did
know
she
did
mean
to
tell
him
quite
yet
she
wanted
to
see
tregear
here
in
england
first
of
course
i
shall
do
nothing
till
papa
does
know
you
will
not
see
him
how
can
i
see
him
here
he
will
not
come
here
if
you
mean
that
you
do
not
correspond
with
him
here
for
the
first
time
the
girl
blushed
oh
mary
if
you
are
writing
to
him
your
father
ought
to
know
it
i
have
not
written
to
him
but
when
he
heard
how
ill
poor
mamma
was
then
he
wrote
to
me
twice
you
may
see
his
letters
it
is
all
about
her
no
one
worshipped
mamma
as
he
did
gradually
the
whole
story
was
told
these
two
young
persons
considered
themselves
to
be
engaged
but
had
agreed
that
their
engagement
should
not
be
made
known
to
the
duke
till
something
had
occurred
or
some
time
had
arrived
as
to
which
tregear
was
to
be
the
judge
in
finn
opinion
nothing
could
be
more
unwise
and
she
said
much
to
induce
the
girl
to
confess
everything
to
her
father
at
once
but
in
all
her
arguments
she
was
opposed
by
the
reference
to
her
mother
mamma
knew
it
and
it
did
certainly
seem
to
finn
as
though
the
mother
had
assented
to
this
imprudent
concealment
when
she
endeavoured
in
her
own
mind
to
make
excuse
for
her
friend
she
felt
almost
sure
that
the
duchess
with
all
her
courage
had
been
afraid
to
propose
to
her
husband
that
their
daughter
should
marry
a
commoner
without
an
income
but
in
thinking
of
all
that
there
could
now
be
nothing
gained
what
ought
she
to
do
at
once
the
girl
in
telling
her
had
exacted
no
promise
of
secrecy
nor
would
she
have
given
any
such
promise
but
yet
she
did
not
like
the
idea
of
telling
the
tale
behind
the
girl
back
it
was
evident
that
lady
mary
had
considered
herself
to
be
safe
in
confiding
her
story
to
her
mother
old
friend
lady
mary
no
doubt
had
had
her
confidences
with
her
mother
confidences
from
which
it
had
been
intended
by
both
that
the
father
should
be
excluded
and
now
she
seemed
naturally
to
expect
that
this
new
ally
should
look
at
this
great
question
as
her
mother
had
looked
at
it
the
father
had
been
regarded
as
a
great
outside
power
which
could
hardly
be
overcome
but
which
might
be
evaded
or
made
inoperative
by
stratagem
it
was
not
that
the
daughter
did
not
love
him
she
loved
him
and
venerated
him
highly
the
veneration
perhaps
being
stronger
than
the
love
the
duchess
too
had
loved
him
dearly
more
dearly
in
late
years
than
in
her
early
life
but
her
husband
to
her
had
always
been
an
outside
power
which
had
in
many
cases
to
be
evaded
lady
mary
though
she
did
not
express
all
this
evidently
thought
that
in
this
new
friend
she
had
found
a
woman
whose
wishes
and
aspirations
for
her
would
be
those
which
her
mother
had
entertained
but
finn
was
much
troubled
in
her
mind
thinking
that
it
was
her
duty
to
tell
the
story
to
the
duke
it
was
not
only
the
daughter
who
had
trusted
her
but
the
father
also
and
the
father
confidence
had
been
not
only
the
first
but
by
far
the
holier
of
the
two
and
the
question
was
one
so
important
to
the
girl
future
happiness
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
peril
of
her
present
position
was
very
great
mary
she
said
one
morning
when
the
fortnight
was
nearly
at
an
end
your
father
ought
to
know
all
this
i
should
feel
that
i
had
betrayed
him
were
i
to
go
away
leaving
him
in
ignorance
you
do
not
mean
to
say
that
you
will
tell
said
the
girl
horrified
at
the
idea
of
such
treachery
i
wish
that
i
could
induce
you
to
do
so
every
day
that
he
is
kept
in
the
dark
is
an
injury
to
you
i
am
doing
nothing
what
harm
can
come
it
is
not
as
though
i
were
seeing
him
every
day
this
harm
will
come
your
father
of
course
will
know
that
you
became
engaged
to
tregear
in
italy
and
that
a
fact
so
important
to
him
has
been
kept
back
from
him
if
there
is
anything
in
that
the
evil
has
been
done
already
of
course
poor
mamma
did
mean
to
tell
him
she
can
not
tell
him
now
and
therefore
you
ought
to
do
what
she
would
have
done
i
can
not
break
my
promise
to
him
him
always
meant
tregear
i
have
told
him
that
i
would
not
do
so
till
i
had
his
consent
and
i
will
not
this
was
very
dreadful
to
finn
and
yet
she
was
most
unwilling
to
take
upon
herself
the
part
of
a
stern
elder
and
declare
that
under
the
circumstances
she
must
tell
the
tale
the
story
had
been
told
to
her
under
the
supposition
that
she
was
not
a
stern
elder
that
she
was
regarded
as
the
special
friend
of
the
dear
mother
who
was
gone
that
she
might
be
trusted
to
assist
against
the
terrible
weight
of
parental
authority
she
could
not
endure
to
be
regarded
at
once
as
a
traitor
by
this
young
friend
who
had
sweetly
inherited
the
affection
with
which
the
duchess
had
regarded
her
and
yet
if
she
were
to
be
silent
how
could
she
forgive
herself
the
duke
certainly
ought
to
know
at
once
said
she
repeating
her
words
merely
that
she
might
gain
some
time
for
thinking
and
pluck
up
courage
to
declare
her
purpose
should
she
resolve
on
betraying
the
secret
if
you
tell
him
now
i
will
never
forgive
you
said
lady
mary
i
am
bound
in
honour
to
see
that
your
father
knows
a
thing
which
is
of
such
vital
importance
to
him
and
to
you
having
heard
all
this
i
have
no
right
to
keep
it
from
him
if
tregear
really
loves
you
lady
mary
smiled
at
the
doubt
implied
by
this
suggestion
he
ought
to
feel
that
for
your
sake
there
should
be
no
secret
from
your
father
then
she
paused
a
moment
to
think
will
you
let
me
see
tregear
myself
and
talk
to
him
about
it
to
this
lady
mary
at
first
demurred
but
when
she
found
that
in
no
other
way
could
she
prevent
finn
from
going
at
once
to
the
duke
and
telling
him
everything
she
consented
under
directions
she
wrote
a
note
to
her
lover
which
finn
saw
and
then
undertook
to
send
it
with
a
letter
from
herself
to
tregear
address
in
london
the
note
was
very
short
and
was
indeed
dictated
by
the
elder
lady
with
some
dispute
however
as
to
certain
terms
in
which
the
younger
lady
had
her
way
it
was
as
follows
dearest
frank
i
wish
you
to
see
finn
who
as
you
know
was
dear
mamma
most
particular
friend
please
go
to
her
as
she
will
ask
you
to
do
when
you
hear
what
she
says
i
think
you
ought
to
do
what
she
advises
yours
for
ever
and
always
this
finn
sent
enclosed
in
an
envelope
with
a
few
words
from
herself
asking
the
gentleman
to
call
upon
her
in
park
lane
on
a
day
and
at
an
hour

francis
oliphant
tregear
francis
oliphant
tregear
was
a
young
man
who
might
not
improbably
make
a
figure
in
the
world
should
circumstances
be
kind
to
him
but
as
to
whom
it
might
be
doubted
whether
circumstances
would
be
sufficiently
kind
to
enable
him
to
use
serviceably
his
unquestionable
talents
and
great
personal
gifts
he
had
taught
himself
to
regard
himself
as
a
young
english
gentleman
of
the
first
water
qualified
by
his
birth
and
position
to
live
with
all
that
was
most
noble
and
most
elegant
and
he
could
have
lived
in
that
sphere
naturally
and
gracefully
were
it
not
that
the
part
of
the
sphere
which
he
specially
affected
requires
wealth
as
well
as
birth
and
intellect
wealth
he
had
not
and
yet
he
did
not
abandon
the
sphere
as
a
consequence
of
all
this
it
was
possible
that
the
predictions
of
his
friends
as
to
that
figure
which
he
was
to
make
in
the
world
might
be
disappointed
he
had
been
educated
at
eton
from
whence
he
had
been
sent
to
christ
church
and
both
at
school
and
at
college
had
been
the
most
intimate
friend
of
the
son
and
heir
of
a
great
and
wealthy
duke
he
and
lord
silverbridge
had
been
always
together
and
they
who
were
interested
in
the
career
of
the
young
nobleman
had
generally
thought
he
had
chosen
his
friend
well
tregear
had
gone
out
in
honours
having
been
a
man
his
friend
silverbridge
we
know
had
been
allowed
to
take
no
degree
at
all
but
the
terrible
practical
joke
by
which
the
whole
front
of
the
dean
house
had
been
coloured
scarlet
in
the
middle
of
the
night
had
been
carried
on
without
any
assistance
from
tregear
the
two
young
men
had
then
been
separated
for
a
year
but
immediately
after
taking
his
degree
tregear
at
the
invitation
of
lord
silverbridge
had
gone
to
italy
and
had
there
completely
made
good
his
footing
with
the
duchess
with
what
effect
on
another
member
of
the
palliser
family
the
reader
already
knows
the
young
man
was
certainly
clever
when
the
duchess
found
that
he
could
talk
without
any
shyness
that
he
could
speak
french
fluently
and
that
after
a
month
in
italy
he
could
chatter
italian
at
any
rate
without
reticence
or
shame
when
she
perceived
that
all
the
women
liked
the
lad
society
and
impudence
and
that
all
the
young
men
were
anxious
to
know
him
she
was
glad
to
find
that
silverbridge
had
chosen
so
valuable
a
friend
and
then
he
was
beautiful
to
look
at
putting
her
almost
in
mind
of
another
man
on
whom
her
eyes
had
once
loved
to
dwell
he
was
dark
with
hair
that
was
almost
black
but
yet
was
not
black
with
clear
brown
eyes
a
nose
as
regular
as
apollo
and
a
mouth
in
which
was
ever
to
be
found
that
expression
of
manliness
which
of
all
characteristics
is
the
one
which
women
love
the
best
he
was
five
feet
ten
in
height
he
was
always
well
dressed
and
yet
always
so
dressed
as
to
seem
to
show
that
his
outside
garniture
had
not
been
matter
of
trouble
to
him
before
the
duchess
had
dreamed
what
might
take
place
between
this
young
man
and
her
daughter
she
had
been
urgent
in
her
congratulations
to
her
son
as
to
the
possession
of
such
a
friend
for
though
she
now
and
then
would
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
outer
man
which
would
remind
her
of
that
other
beautiful
one
whom
she
had
known
in
her
youth
and
though
as
these
glimpses
came
she
would
remember
how
poor
in
spirit
and
how
unmanly
that
other
one
had
been
though
she
would
confess
to
herself
how
terrible
had
been
the
which
that
other
one
had
brought
upon
herself
still
she
was
able
completely
to
assure
herself
that
this
man
though
not
superior
in
external
grace
was
altogether
different
in
mind
and
character
she
was
old
enough
now
to
see
all
this
and
to
appreciate
it
young
tregear
had
his
own
ideas
about
the
politics
of
the
day
and
they
were
ideas
with
which
she
sympathised
though
they
were
antagonistic
to
the
politics
of
her
life
he
had
his
ideas
about
books
too
as
to
manners
of
life
as
to
art
and
even
ethics
whether
or
no
in
all
this
there
was
not
much
that
was
superficial
only
she
was
not
herself
deep
enough
to
discover
nor
would
she
have
been
deterred
from
admiring
him
had
she
been
told
that
it
was
tinsel
such
were
the
acquirements
such
the
charms
that
she
loved
here
was
a
young
man
who
dared
to
speak
and
had
always
something
ready
to
be
spoken
who
was
not
afraid
of
beauty
nor
daunted
by
superiority
of
rank
who
if
he
had
not
money
could
carry
himself
on
equal
terms
among
those
who
had
in
this
way
he
won
the
duchess
heart
and
having
done
that
was
it
odd
that
he
should
win
the
heart
of
the
daughter
also
his
father
was
a
cornwall
squire
of
comfortable
means
having
joined
the
property
of
his
wife
to
his
own
for
the
period
of
his
own
life
she
had
possessed
land
also
in
cornwall
supposed
to
be
worth
fifteen
hundred
a
year
and
his
own
paternal
estate
at
polwenning
was
said
to
be
double
that
value
being
a
prudent
man
he
lived
at
home
as
a
country
gentleman
and
thus
was
able
in
his
county
to
hold
his
head
as
high
as
richer
men
but
frank
tregear
was
only
his
second
son
and
though
frank
would
hereafter
inherit
his
mother
fortune
he
was
by
no
means
now
in
a
position
to
assume
the
right
of
living
as
an
idle
man
yet
he
was
idle
the
elder
brother
who
was
considerably
older
than
frank
was
an
odd
man
much
addicted
to
quarrelling
with
his
family
and
who
spent
his
time
chiefly
in
travelling
about
the
world
frank
mother
who
was
not
the
mother
of
the
heir
also
would
sometimes
surmise
in
frank
hearing
that
the
entire
property
must
ultimately
come
to
him
that
other
tregear
who
was
now
supposed
to
be
investigating
the
mountains
of
crim
tartary
would
surely
never
marry
and
frank
was
the
favourite
also
with
his
father
who
paid
his
debts
at
oxford
with
not
much
grumbling
who
was
proud
of
his
friendship
with
a
future
duke
who
did
not
urge
as
he
ought
to
have
urged
that
vital
question
of
a
profession
and
who
when
he
allowed
his
son
four
hundred
pounds
a
year
was
almost
content
with
that
son
protestations
that
he
knew
how
to
live
as
a
poor
man
among
rich
men
without
chagrin
and
without
trouble
such
was
the
young
man
who
now
in
lieu
of
a
profession
had
taken
upon
himself
the
responsibility
of
an
engagement
with
lady
mary
palliser
he
was
tolerably
certain
that
should
he
be
able
to
overcome
the
parental
obstacles
which
he
would
no
doubt
find
in
his
path
money
would
be
forthcoming
sufficient
for
the
purposes
of
matrimonial
life
the
duke
wealth
was
fabulous
and
as
a
great
part
of
it
if
not
the
greater
had
come
from
his
wife
there
would
probably
be
ample
provision
for
the
younger
children
and
when
the
duchess
had
found
out
how
things
were
going
and
had
yielded
to
her
daughter
after
an
opposition
which
never
had
the
appearance
even
of
being
in
earnest
she
had
taken
upon
herself
to
say
that
she
would
use
her
influence
to
prevent
any
great
weight
of
trouble
from
pecuniary
matters
frank
tregear
young
and
bright
and
full
of
hearty
ambitions
was
certainly
not
the
man
to
pursue
a
girl
simply
because
of
her
fortune
nor
was
he
weak
enough
to
be
attracted
simply
by
the
glitter
of
rank
but
he
was
wise
enough
with
worldly
wisdom
to
understand
thoroughly
the
comforts
of
a
good
income
and
he
was
sufficiently
attached
to
high
position
to
feel
the
advantage
of
marrying
a
daughter
of
the
duke
of
omnium
when
the
duchess
was
leaving
italy
it
had
been
her
declared
purpose
to
tell
her
husband
the
story
as
soon
as
they
were
at
home
in
england
and
it
was
on
this
understanding
that
frank
tregear
had
explained
to
the
girl
that
he
would
not
as
yet
ask
her
father
for
his
permission
to
be
received
into
the
family
as
a
suitor
everyone
concerned
had
felt
that
the
duke
would
not
easily
be
reconciled
to
such
a
and
that
the
duchess
should
be
the
one
to
bell
the
cat
there
was
one
member
of
the
family
who
had
hitherto
been
in
the
matter
lord
silverbridge
had
vacillated
between
loyalty
to
his
friend
and
a
certain
feeling
as
to
the
impropriety
of
such
a
match
for
his
sister
he
was
aware
that
something
very
much
better
should
be
expected
for
her
and
still
was
unable
to
explain
his
objections
to
tregear
he
had
not
at
first
been
admitted
into
confidence
either
by
his
sister
or
by
tregear
but
had
questioned
his
friend
when
he
saw
what
was
going
on
certainly
i
love
your
sister
tregear
had
said
do
you
object
lord
silverbridge
was
the
weaker
of
the
two
and
much
subject
to
the
influence
of
his
friend
but
he
could
on
occasion
be
firm
and
he
did
at
first
object
but
he
did
not
object
strongly
and
allowed
himself
at
last
to
be
content
with
declaring
that
the
duke
would
never
give
his
consent
while
tregear
was
with
his
love
or
near
her
his
hopes
and
fears
were
sufficient
to
occupy
his
mind
and
immediately
on
his
return
all
the
world
was
nothing
to
him
except
as
far
as
the
world
was
concerned
with
lady
mary
palliser
he
had
come
back
to
england
somewhat
before
the
ducal
party
and
the
pleasures
and
occupations
of
london
life
had
not
abated
his
love
but
enabled
him
to
feel
that
there
was
something
in
life
over
and
beyond
his
love
whereas
to
lady
mary
down
at
matching
there
had
been
nothing
over
and
beyond
her
love
except
the
infinite
grief
and
desolation
produced
by
her
mother
death
tregear
when
he
received
the
note
from
finn
was
staying
at
the
duke
house
in
carlton
terrace
silverbridge
was
there
and
on
leaving
matching
had
asked
the
duke
permission
to
have
his
friend
with
him
the
duke
at
that
time
was
not
well
pleased
with
his
son
as
to
a
matter
of
politics
and
gave
his
son
friend
credit
for
the
evil
counsel
which
had
produced
this
displeasure
but
still
he
had
not
refused
his
assent
to
this
proposition
had
he
done
so
silverbridge
would
probably
have
gone
elsewhere
and
though
there
was
a
matter
in
respect
to
tregear
of
which
the
duke
disapproved
it
was
not
a
matter
as
he
thought
which
would
have
justified
him
in
expelling
the
young
man
from
his
house
the
young
man
was
a
strong
conservative
and
now
silverbridge
had
declared
his
purpose
of
entering
the
house
of
commons
if
he
did
enter
it
as
one
of
the
conservative
party
this
had
been
a
terrible
blow
to
the
duke
and
he
believed
that
it
all
came
from
this
young
tregear
still
he
must
do
his
duty
and
not
more
than
his
duty
he
knew
nothing
against
tregear
that
a
tregear
should
be
a
conservative
was
perhaps
natural
enough
at
any
rate
was
not
disgraceful
that
he
should
have
his
political
creed
sufficiently
at
heart
to
be
able
to
persuade
another
man
was
to
his
credit
he
was
a
gentleman
well
educated
superior
in
many
things
to
silverbridge
himself
there
were
those
who
said
that
silverbridge
had
redeemed
himself
from
contempt
from
that
sort
of
contempt
which
might
be
supposed
to
await
a
young
nobleman
who
had
painted
scarlet
the
residence
of
the
head
of
his
college
by
the
fact
of
his
having
chosen
such
a
friend
the
duke
was
essentially
a
just
man
and
though
at
the
very
moment
in
which
the
request
was
made
his
heart
was
half
crushed
by
his
son
apostasy
he
gave
the
permission
asked
you
know
mrs
finn
tregear
said
to
his
friend
one
morning
at
breakfast
i
remember
her
all
my
life
she
used
to
be
a
great
deal
with
my
grandfather
i
believe
he
left
her
a
lot
of
diamonds
and
money
and
that
she
would
have
them
i
do
know
whether
the
diamonds
are
not
locked
up
somewhere
now
so
that
she
can
take
them
when
she
pleases
what
a
singular
woman
it
was
odd
but
she
had
some
fad
about
it
what
makes
you
ask
about
mrs
finn
she
wants
me
to
go
and
see
her
what
about
i
think
i
have
heard
your
mother
speak
of
her
as
though
she
loved
her
dearly
said
tregear
i
do
know
about
loving
her
dearly
they
were
intimate
and
finn
used
to
be
with
her
very
much
when
she
was
in
the
country
she
was
at
matching
just
now
when
my
poor
mother
died
why
does
she
want
to
see
you
she
has
written
to
me
from
matching
she
wants
to
see
me
well
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
do
not
know
what
she
has
to
say
to
me
though
i
can
guess
what
do
you
guess
it
is
something
about
your
sister
you
will
have
to
give
that
up
tregear
i
think
not
yes
you
will
my
father
will
never
stand
it
i
do
know
what
there
is
to
stand
i
am
not
noble
nor
am
i
rich
but
i
am
as
good
a
gentleman
as
he
is
my
dear
fellow
said
the
young
lord
you
know
very
well
what
i
think
about
all
that
a
fellow
is
not
any
better
to
me
because
he
has
got
a
title
nor
yet
because
he
owns
half
a
county
but
men
have
their
ideas
and
feelings
about
it
my
father
is
a
rich
man
and
of
course
he
want
his
daughter
to
marry
a
rich
man
my
father
is
noble
and
he
want
his
daughter
to
marry
a
nobleman
you
very
well
marry
mary
without
his
permission
and
therefore
you
had
better
let
it
alone
i
have
even
asked
his
permission
as
yet
even
my
mother
was
afraid
to
speak
to
him
about
it
and
i
never
knew
her
to
be
afraid
to
say
anything
else
to
him
i
shall
not
be
afraid
said
tregear
looking
grimly
i
should
that
the
difference
between
us
he
ca
very
well
eat
me
nor
even
bite
you
nor
will
he
abuse
you
but
he
can
look
at
you
and
he
can
say
a
word
or
two
which
you
will
find
it
very
hard
to
bear
my
governor
is
the
quietest
man
i
know
but
he
has
a
way
of
making
himself
disagreeable
when
he
wishes
that
i
never
saw
equalled
at
any
rate
i
had
better
go
and
see
your
mrs
finn
then
tregear
wrote
a
line
to
finn
and
made
his
appointment
chapter
iv
park
lane
from
the
beginning
of
the
affair
tregear
had
found
the
necessity
of
bolstering
himself
up
inwardly
in
his
great
attempt
by
mottoes
proverbs
and
instigations
to
courage
addressed
to
himself
none
but
the
brave
deserve
the
fair
de
et
encore
de
et
toujours
de
he
was
a
man
naturally
of
good
heart
in
such
matters
who
was
not
afraid
of
his
nor
yet
of
women
his
sisters
but
in
this
affair
he
knew
very
much
persistence
would
be
required
of
him
and
that
even
with
such
persistence
he
might
probably
fail
unless
he
should
find
a
more
than
ordinary
constancy
in
the
girl
that
the
duke
could
not
eat
him
indeed
that
nobody
could
eat
him
as
long
as
he
carried
himself
as
an
honest
man
and
a
gentleman
was
to
him
an
inward
assurance
on
which
he
leaned
much
and
yet
he
was
conscious
almost
with
a
feeling
of
shame
that
in
italy
he
had
not
spoken
to
the
duke
about
his
daughter
because
he
was
afraid
lest
the
duke
might
eat
him
in
such
an
affair
he
should
have
been
careful
from
the
first
to
keep
his
own
hands
thoroughly
clean
had
it
not
been
his
duty
as
a
gentleman
to
communicate
with
the
father
if
not
before
he
gained
the
girl
heart
at
any
rate
as
soon
as
he
knew
he
had
done
so
he
had
left
italy
thinking
that
he
would
certainly
meet
the
duchess
and
her
daughter
in
london
and
that
then
he
might
go
to
the
duke
as
though
this
love
of
his
had
arisen
from
the
sweetness
of
those
meetings
in
london
but
all
these
ideas
had
been
dissipated
by
the
great
misfortune
of
the
death
of
lady
mother
from
all
this
he
was
driven
to
acknowledge
to
himself
that
his
silence
in
italy
had
been
wrong
that
he
had
been
weak
in
allowing
himself
to
be
guided
by
the
counsel
of
the
duchess
and
that
he
had
already
armed
the
duke
with
one
strong
argument
against
him
he
did
not
doubt
but
that
finn
would
be
opposed
to
him
of
course
he
could
not
doubt
but
that
all
the
world
would
now
be
opposed
to
him
except
the
girl
herself
he
would
find
no
other
friend
so
generous
so
romantic
so
unworldly
as
the
duchess
had
been
it
was
clear
to
him
that
lady
mary
had
told
the
story
of
her
engagement
to
finn
and
that
finn
had
not
as
yet
told
it
to
the
duke
from
this
he
was
justified
in
regarding
finn
as
the
friend
the
request
made
was
that
he
should
at
once
do
something
which
finn
was
to
suggest
he
could
hardly
have
been
so
requested
and
that
in
terms
of
such
warm
affection
had
it
been
finn
intention
to
ask
him
to
desist
altogether
from
his
courtship
this
woman
was
regarded
by
lady
mary
as
her
mother
dearest
friend
it
was
therefore
incumbent
on
him
now
to
induce
her
to
believe
in
him
as
the
duchess
had
believed
he
knocked
at
the
door
of
finn
little
house
in
park
lane
a
few
minutes
before
the
time
appointed
and
found
himself
alone
when
he
was
shown
into
the
he
had
heard
much
of
this
lady
though
he
had
never
seen
her
and
had
heard
much
also
of
her
husband
there
had
been
a
kind
of
mystery
about
her
people
did
not
quite
understand
how
it
was
that
she
had
been
so
intimate
with
the
duchess
nor
why
the
late
duke
had
left
to
her
an
enormous
legacy
which
as
yet
had
never
been
claimed
there
was
supposed
too
to
have
been
something
especially
romantic
in
her
marriage
with
her
present
husband
it
was
believed
also
that
she
was
very
rich
the
rumours
of
all
these
things
together
had
made
her
a
person
of
note
and
tregear
when
he
found
himself
alone
in
the
looked
round
about
him
as
though
a
special
interest
was
to
be
attached
to
the
belongings
of
such
a
woman
it
was
a
pretty
room
somewhat
dark
because
the
curtains
were
almost
closed
across
the
windows
but
furnished
with
a
pretty
taste
and
now
in
these
early
april
days
filled
with
flowers
i
have
to
apologise
tregear
for
keeping
you
waiting
she
said
as
she
entered
the
room
i
fear
i
was
before
my
time
i
know
that
i
am
after
mine
a
few
minutes
said
the
lady
he
told
himself
that
though
she
was
not
a
young
woman
yet
she
was
attractive
she
was
dark
and
still
wore
her
black
hair
in
curls
such
as
are
now
seldom
seen
with
ladies
perhaps
the
reduced
light
of
the
chamber
had
been
regulated
with
some
regard
to
her
complexion
and
to
her
age
the
effect
however
was
good
and
frank
tregear
felt
at
once
interested
in
her
you
have
just
come
up
from
matching
he
said
yes
only
the
day
before
yesterday
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
come
to
me
so
soon
of
course
i
came
when
you
sent
for
me
i
am
afraid
the
duke
felt
his
loss
severely
how
should
he
not
such
a
loss
as
it
was
few
people
knew
how
much
he
trusted
her
and
how
dearly
he
loved
her
silverbridge
has
told
me
that
he
is
awfully
cut
up
you
have
seen
lord
silverbridge
then
just
at
present
i
am
living
with
him
at
carlton
terrace
in
the
duke
house
she
asked
with
some
surprise
yes
in
the
duke
house
silverbridge
and
i
have
been
very
intimate
of
course
the
duke
knows
that
i
am
there
is
there
any
chance
of
his
coming
to
town
not
yet
i
fear
he
is
determined
to
be
alone
i
wish
it
were
otherwise
as
i
am
sure
he
would
better
bear
his
sorrow
if
he
would
go
about
among
other
men
no
doubt
he
would
suffer
less
said
tregear
then
there
was
a
pause
each
wished
that
the
other
should
introduce
the
matter
which
both
knew
was
to
be
the
subject
of
their
conversation
but
tregear
would
not
begin
when
i
left
them
all
at
florence
he
said
i
little
thought
that
i
should
never
see
her
again
you
had
been
intimate
with
them
mr
tregear
yes
i
think
i
may
say
i
have
been
intimate
with
them
i
had
been
at
eton
and
at
christ
church
with
silverbridge
and
we
have
always
been
much
together
i
have
understood
that
have
you
and
the
duke
been
good
friends
we
have
never
been
enemies
i
suppose
not
that
the
duke
i
think
does
not
much
care
about
young
people
i
hardly
know
what
he
used
to
do
with
himself
when
i
dined
with
them
i
saw
him
but
i
did
not
often
do
that
i
think
he
used
to
read
a
good
deal
and
walk
about
alone
we
were
always
riding
lady
mary
used
to
ride
oh
yes
and
lord
silverbridge
and
lord
gerald
and
the
duchess
used
to
drive
one
of
us
would
always
be
with
her
and
so
you
became
intimate
with
the
whole
family
so
i
became
intimate
with
the
whole
family
and
especially
so
with
lady
mary
this
she
said
in
her
sweetest
possible
tone
and
with
a
most
gracious
smile
especially
so
with
lady
mary
he
replied
it
will
be
very
good
of
you
tregear
if
you
endure
and
forgive
all
this
from
me
who
am
a
perfect
stranger
to
you
but
you
are
not
a
perfect
stranger
to
her
that
is
it
of
course
now
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
explain
to
you
exactly
what
my
footing
with
her
is
when
the
duchess
returned
and
when
i
found
her
to
be
so
ill
as
she
passed
through
london
i
went
down
with
her
into
the
country
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
so
i
understand
and
there
she
died
in
my
arms
i
will
not
try
to
harass
you
by
telling
you
what
those
few
days
were
how
absolutely
he
was
struck
to
the
ground
how
terrible
was
the
grief
of
the
daughter
how
the
boys
were
astonished
by
the
feeling
of
their
loss
after
a
few
days
they
went
away
it
was
i
think
their
father
wish
that
they
should
go
and
i
too
was
going
away
and
had
felt
indeed
directly
her
spirit
had
parted
from
her
that
i
was
only
in
the
way
in
his
house
but
i
stayed
at
his
request
because
he
did
not
wish
his
daughter
to
be
alone
i
can
easily
understand
that
mrs
finn
i
wanted
her
to
go
to
lady
cantrip
who
had
invited
her
but
she
would
not
in
that
way
we
were
thrown
together
in
the
closest
intercourse
for
two
or
three
weeks
then
she
told
me
the
story
of
your
engagement
that
was
natural
i
suppose
surely
so
think
of
her
position
left
as
she
is
without
a
mother
it
was
incumbent
on
her
to
tell
someone
there
was
however
one
other
person
in
whom
it
would
have
been
much
better
that
she
should
have
confided
what
person
her
father
i
rather
fancy
that
it
is
i
who
ought
to
tell
him
as
far
as
i
understand
these
things
tregear
which
indeed
is
very
imperfectly
i
think
it
is
natural
that
a
girl
should
at
once
tell
her
mother
when
a
gentleman
has
made
her
understand
that
he
loves
her
she
did
so
mrs
finn
and
i
suppose
that
generally
the
mother
would
tell
the
father
she
did
not
no
and
therefore
the
position
of
the
young
lady
is
now
one
of
great
embarrassment
the
duchess
has
gone
from
us
and
we
must
now
make
up
our
minds
as
to
what
had
better
be
done
it
is
out
of
the
question
that
lady
mary
should
be
allowed
to
consider
herself
to
be
engaged
and
that
the
father
should
be
kept
in
ignorance
of
her
position
she
paused
for
his
reply
but
as
he
said
nothing
she
continued
either
you
must
tell
the
duke
or
she
must
do
so
or
i
must
do
so
i
suppose
she
told
you
in
confidence
no
doubt
she
told
it
me
presuming
that
i
would
not
betray
her
but
i
shall
if
that
be
a
betrayal
the
duke
must
know
it
it
will
be
infinitely
better
that
he
should
know
it
through
you
or
through
her
than
through
me
but
he
must
be
told
i
ca
quite
see
why
said
tregear
for
her
sake
whom
i
suppose
you
love
certainly
i
love
her
in
order
that
she
may
not
suffer
i
wonder
you
do
not
see
it
tregear
perhaps
you
have
a
sister
i
have
no
sister
as
it
happens
but
you
can
imagine
what
your
feelings
would
be
should
you
like
to
think
of
a
sister
as
being
engaged
to
a
man
without
the
knowledge
of
any
of
her
family
it
was
not
so
the
duchess
knew
it
the
present
condition
of
things
is
altogether
an
accident
it
is
an
accident
that
must
be
brought
to
an
end
of
course
it
must
be
brought
to
an
end
i
am
not
such
a
fool
as
to
suppose
that
i
can
make
her
my
wife
without
telling
her
father
i
mean
at
once
mr
tregear
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
rather
dictating
to
me
mrs
finn
i
owe
you
an
apology
of
course
for
meddling
in
your
affairs
at
all
but
as
it
will
be
more
conducive
to
your
success
that
the
duke
should
hear
this
from
you
than
from
me
and
as
i
feel
that
i
am
bound
by
my
duty
to
him
and
to
lady
mary
to
see
that
he
be
not
left
in
ignorance
i
think
that
i
am
doing
you
a
service
i
do
not
like
to
have
a
constraint
put
upon
me
that
tregear
is
what
gentlemen
i
fancy
very
often
feel
in
regard
to
ladies
but
the
constraint
of
which
you
speak
is
necessary
for
their
protection
are
you
unwilling
to
see
the
duke
he
was
very
unwilling
but
he
would
not
confess
so
much
he
gave
various
reasons
for
delay
urging
repeatedly
that
the
question
of
his
marriage
was
one
which
he
could
not
press
upon
the
duke
so
soon
after
the
death
of
the
duchess
and
when
she
assured
him
that
this
was
a
matter
of
importance
so
great
that
even
the
death
of
the
man
wife
should
not
be
held
by
him
to
justify
delay
he
became
angry
and
for
awhile
insisted
that
he
must
be
allowed
to
follow
his
own
judgment
but
he
gave
her
a
promise
that
he
would
see
the
duke
before
a
week
was
over
nevertheless
he
left
the
house
in
dudgeon
having
told
finn
more
than
once
that
she
was
taking
advantage
of
lady
confidence
they
hardly
parted
as
friends
and
her
feeling
was
on
the
whole
hostile
to
him
and
to
his
love
it
could
not
she
thought
be
for
the
happiness
of
such
a
one
as
lady
mary
that
she
should
give
herself
to
one
who
seemed
to
have
so
little
to
recommend
him
he
when
he
had
left
her
was
angry
with
his
own
weakness
he
had
not
only
promised
that
he
would
make
his
application
to
the
duke
but
that
he
would
do
so
within
the
period
of
a
week
who
was
she
that
she
should
exact
terms
from
him
after
this
fashion
and
prescribe
days
and
hours
and
now
because
this
strange
woman
had
spoken
to
him
he
was
compelled
to
make
a
journey
down
to
the
duke
country
house
and
seek
an
interview
in
which
he
would
surely
be
snubbed
this
occurred
on
a
wednesday
and
he
resolved
that
he
would
go
down
to
matching
on
the
next
monday
he
said
nothing
of
his
plan
to
any
one
and
not
a
word
passed
between
him
and
lord
silverbridge
about
lady
mary
during
the
first
two
or
three
days
but
on
the
saturday
silverbridge
appeared
at
breakfast
with
a
letter
in
his
hand
the
governor
is
coming
up
to
town
he
said
immediately
in
the
course
of
next
week
he
says
that
he
thinks
he
shall
be
here
on
wednesday
it
immediately
struck
tregear
that
this
sudden
journey
must
have
some
reference
to
lady
mary
and
her
engagement
do
you
know
why
he
is
coming
because
of
these
vacancies
in
parliament
why
should
that
bring
him
up
i
suppose
he
hopes
to
be
able
to
talk
me
into
obedience
he
wants
me
to
stand
for
the
county
as
a
liberal
of
course
i
intend
to
stand
for
the
borough
as
a
conservative
and
i
have
told
them
so
down
at
silverbridge
i
am
very
sorry
to
annoy
him
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
but
what
the
deuce
is
a
fellow
to
do
if
a
man
has
got
political
convictions
of
his
own
of
course
he
must
stick
to
them
this
the
young
lord
said
with
a
good
deal
of
as
though
he
by
the
light
of
his
own
reason
had
ascertained
on
which
side
the
truth
lay
in
political
contests
of
the
day
there
is
a
good
deal
to
be
said
on
both
sides
of
the
question
my
boy
at
this
particular
moment
tregear
felt
that
the
duke
ought
to
be
propitiated
you
would
have
me
give
up
my
convictions
a
seat
in
parliament
is
a
great
thing
i
can
probably
secure
that
whichever
side
i
take
i
thought
you
were
so
devilish
hot
against
the
radicals
so
i
am
but
then
you
are
as
it
were
bound
by
family
allegiance
i
be
shot
if
i
am
one
never
knows
how
to
understand
you
nowadays
it
used
to
be
a
great
doctrine
with
you
that
nothing
should
induce
a
man
to
vote
against
his
political
opinions
so
it
is
if
he
has
really
got
any
however
as
your
father
is
coming
to
london
i
need
not
go
down
to
matching
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
were
going
to
matching
i
had
intended
to
beard
the
lion
in
his
country
den
but
now
the
lion
will
find
me
in
his
own
town
den
and
i
must
beard
him
here
then
tregear
wrote
a
most
chilling
note
to
finn
informing
her
with
great
precision
that
as
the
duke
of
omnium
intended
to
be
in
town
one
day
next
week
he
would
postpone
the
performance
of
his
promise
for
a
day
or
two
beyond
the
allotted
time
chapter
v
it
is
impossible
down
at
matching
lady
mary
life
was
very
dull
after
finn
had
left
her
she
had
a
horse
to
ride
but
had
no
one
to
ride
with
her
she
had
a
carriage
in
which
to
be
driven
but
no
one
to
be
driven
with
her
and
no
special
places
whither
to
go
her
father
would
walk
daily
for
two
hours
and
she
would
accompany
him
when
he
encouraged
her
to
do
so
but
she
had
an
idea
that
he
preferred
taking
his
walks
alone
and
when
they
were
together
there
was
no
feeling
of
confidence
between
them
there
could
be
none
on
her
part
as
she
knew
that
she
was
keeping
back
information
which
he
was
entitled
to
possess
on
this
matter
she
received
two
letters
from
finn
in
the
first
of
which
she
was
told
that
tregear
intended
to
present
himself
at
matching
within
a
few
days
and
was
advised
in
the
same
letter
not
to
endeavour
to
see
her
lover
on
that
occasion
and
then
in
the
second
she
was
informed
that
this
interview
with
her
father
was
to
be
sought
not
at
matching
but
in
london
from
this
latter
letter
there
was
of
course
some
disappointment
though
some
feeling
of
relief
had
he
come
there
she
might
possibly
have
seen
him
after
the
interview
but
she
would
have
been
subjected
to
the
immediate
sternness
of
her
father
anger
that
she
would
now
escape
she
would
not
be
called
on
to
meet
him
just
when
the
first
blow
had
fallen
upon
him
she
was
quite
sure
that
he
would
disapprove
of
the
thing
she
was
quite
sure
that
he
would
be
very
angry
she
knew
that
he
was
a
peculiarly
just
man
and
yet
she
thought
that
in
this
he
would
be
unjust
had
she
been
called
upon
to
sing
the
praises
of
her
father
she
would
have
insisted
above
all
things
on
the
absolute
integrity
of
his
mind
and
yet
knowing
as
she
did
that
he
would
be
opposed
to
her
marriage
with
tregear
she
assured
herself
every
day
and
every
hour
that
he
had
no
right
to
make
any
such
objection
the
man
she
loved
was
a
gentleman
and
an
honest
man
by
no
means
a
fool
and
subject
to
no
vices
her
father
had
no
right
to
demand
that
she
should
give
her
heart
to
a
rich
man
or
to
one
of
high
rank
rank
as
for
rank
she
told
herself
that
she
had
the
most
supreme
contempt
for
it
she
thought
that
she
had
seen
it
near
enough
already
to
be
sure
that
it
ought
to
have
no
special
allurements
what
was
it
doing
for
her
simply
restraining
her
choice
among
comparatively
a
few
who
seemed
to
her
by
no
means
the
best
endowed
of
god
creatures
of
one
thing
she
was
very
sure
that
under
no
pressure
whatsoever
would
she
abandon
her
engagement
with
tregear
that
to
her
had
become
a
bond
almost
as
holy
as
matrimony
itself
could
be
she
had
told
the
man
that
she
loved
him
and
after
that
there
could
be
no
retreat
he
had
kissed
her
and
she
had
returned
his
caress
he
had
told
her
that
she
was
his
as
his
arm
was
round
her
and
she
had
acknowledged
that
it
was
so
that
she
belonged
to
him
and
could
not
be
taken
away
from
him
all
this
was
to
her
a
compact
so
sacred
that
nothing
could
break
it
but
a
desire
on
his
part
to
have
it
annulled
no
other
man
had
ever
whispered
a
word
of
love
to
her
of
no
other
man
had
an
idea
entered
her
mind
that
it
could
be
pleasant
to
join
her
lot
in
life
with
his
with
her
it
had
been
all
new
and
all
sacred
love
with
her
had
that
religion
which
nothing
but
freshness
can
give
it
that
freshness
that
bloom
may
last
through
a
long
life
but
every
change
impairs
it
and
after
many
changes
it
has
perished
for
ever
there
was
no
question
with
her
but
that
she
must
bear
her
father
anger
should
he
be
angry
put
up
with
his
continued
opposition
should
he
resolutely
oppose
her
bear
all
that
the
countesses
of
the
world
might
say
to
her
for
it
was
thus
that
she
thought
of
lady
cantrip
now
any
retrogression
was
beyond
her
power
she
was
walking
with
her
father
when
she
first
heard
of
his
intended
visit
to
london
at
that
time
she
had
received
finn
first
letter
but
not
the
second
i
suppose
you
see
silverbridge
she
said
she
knew
then
that
frank
tregear
was
living
with
her
brother
i
am
going
up
on
purpose
to
see
him
he
is
causing
me
much
annoyance
is
he
extravagant
it
is
not
that
at
present
he
winced
even
as
he
said
this
for
he
had
in
truth
suffered
somewhat
from
demands
made
upon
him
for
money
which
had
hurt
him
not
so
much
by
their
amount
as
by
their
nature
lord
silverbridge
had
taken
upon
himself
to
own
a
horse
or
two
very
much
to
his
father
chagrin
and
was
at
this
moment
part
proprietor
of
an
animal
supposed
to
stand
well
for
the
derby
the
fact
was
not
announced
in
the
papers
with
his
lordship
name
but
his
father
was
aware
of
it
and
did
not
like
it
the
better
because
his
son
held
the
horse
in
partnership
with
a
certain
major
tifto
who
was
well
known
in
the
sporting
world
what
is
it
papa
of
course
he
ought
to
go
into
parliament
i
think
he
wishes
it
himself
yes
but
how
by
a
piece
of
extreme
good
fortune
west
barsetshire
is
open
to
him
the
two
seats
are
vacant
together
there
is
hardly
another
agricultural
county
in
england
that
will
return
a
liberal
and
i
fear
i
am
not
asserting
too
much
in
saying
that
no
other
liberal
could
carry
the
seat
but
one
of
our
family
you
used
to
sit
for
silverbridge
papa
yes
i
did
in
those
days
the
county
returned
four
conservatives
i
can
not
explain
it
all
to
you
but
it
is
his
duty
to
contest
the
county
on
the
liberal
side
but
if
he
is
a
conservative
himself
papa
asked
lady
mary
who
had
had
some
political
ideas
suggested
to
her
own
mind
by
her
lover
it
is
all
rubbish
it
has
come
from
that
young
man
tregear
with
whom
he
has
been
associating
but
papa
said
lady
mary
who
felt
that
even
in
this
matter
she
was
bound
to
be
firm
on
what
was
now
her
side
of
the
question
i
suppose
it
is
as
as
as
respectable
to
be
a
conservative
as
a
liberal
i
do
know
that
at
all
said
the
duke
angrily
i
thought
that
the
two
sides
were
she
was
going
to
express
an
opinion
that
the
two
parties
might
be
supposed
to
stand
as
equal
in
the
respect
of
the
country
when
he
interrupted
her
the
pallisers
have
always
been
liberal
it
will
be
a
blow
to
me
indeed
if
silverbridge
deserts
his
colours
i
know
that
as
yet
he
himself
has
had
no
deep
thoughts
on
the
subject
that
unfortunately
he
does
not
give
himself
much
to
thinking
and
that
in
this
matter
he
is
being
talked
over
by
a
young
man
whose
position
in
life
has
hardly
justified
the
great
intimacy
which
has
existed
this
was
very
far
from
being
comfortable
to
her
but
of
course
she
said
nothing
in
defence
of
tregear
politics
nor
at
present
was
she
disposed
to
say
anything
as
to
his
position
in
life
though
at
some
future
time
she
might
not
be
so
silent
a
few
days
later
they
were
again
walking
together
when
he
spoke
to
her
about
herself
i
can
not
bear
that
you
should
be
left
here
alone
while
i
am
away
he
said
you
will
not
be
long
gone
i
suppose
only
for
three
or
four
days
now
i
shall
not
mind
that
papa
but
very
probably
i
may
have
to
go
into
barsetshire
would
you
not
be
happier
if
you
would
let
me
write
to
lady
cantrip
and
tell
her
that
you
will
go
to
her
no
papa
i
think
not
there
are
times
when
one
feels
that
one
ought
to
be
almost
alone
do
you
feel
that
i
do
not
wish
you
to
feel
it
nor
would
you
do
so
long
if
you
had
other
people
around
you
with
me
it
is
different
i
am
an
old
man
and
can
not
look
for
new
pleasures
in
society
it
has
been
the
fault
of
my
life
to
be
too
much
alone
i
do
not
want
to
see
my
children
follow
me
in
that
it
is
so
very
short
a
time
as
yet
said
she
thinking
of
her
mother
death
but
i
think
that
you
should
be
with
somebody
with
some
woman
who
would
be
kind
to
you
i
like
to
see
you
with
books
but
books
alone
should
not
be
sufficient
at
your
age
how
little
she
thought
did
he
know
of
the
state
either
of
her
heart
or
mind
do
you
dislike
lady
cantrip
i
do
not
know
her
i
ca
say
that
i
dislike
a
person
whom
i
think
i
ever
spoke
to
and
never
saw
above
once
or
twice
but
how
can
i
say
that
i
like
her
she
did
however
know
that
lady
cantrip
was
a
countess
all
over
and
would
be
shocked
at
the
idea
of
a
daughter
of
a
duke
of
omnium
marrying
the
younger
son
of
a
country
squire
nothing
further
was
then
said
on
the
matter
and
when
the
duke
went
to
town
lady
mary
was
left
quite
alone
with
an
understanding
that
if
he
went
into
barsetshire
he
should
come
back
and
take
her
with
him
he
arrived
at
his
own
house
in
carlton
terrace
about
five
in
the
afternoon
and
immediately
went
to
his
study
intending
to
dine
and
spend
the
evening
there
alone
his
son
had
already
pleaded
an
engagement
for
that
afternoon
but
had
consented
to
devote
the
following
morning
to
his
father
wishes
of
the
other
sojourner
in
his
house
the
duke
had
thought
nothing
but
the
other
sojourner
had
thought
very
much
of
the
duke
frank
tregear
was
fully
possessed
of
that
courage
which
induces
a
man
who
knows
that
he
must
be
thrown
over
a
precipice
to
choose
the
first
possible
moment
for
his
fall
he
had
sounded
silverbridge
about
this
change
in
his
politics
and
had
found
his
friend
quite
determined
not
to
go
back
to
the
family
doctrine
such
being
the
case
the
duke
and
hardness
and
general
severity
would
probably
be
enhanced
by
his
interview
with
his
son
tregear
therefore
thinking
that
nothing
could
be
got
by
delay
sent
his
name
in
to
the
duke
before
he
had
been
an
hour
in
the
house
and
asked
for
an
interview
the
servant
brought
back
word
that
his
grace
was
fatigued
but
would
see
tregear
if
the
matter
in
question
was
one
of
importance
frank
heart
quailed
for
a
moment
but
only
for
a
moment
he
took
up
a
pen
and
wrote
a
note
my
dear
duke
of
omnium
if
your
grace
can
spare
a
moment
i
think
you
will
find
that
what
i
have
to
say
will
justify
the
intrusion
your
very
faithful
servant
tregear
of
course
the
duke
admitted
him
there
was
but
one
idea
in
his
head
as
to
what
was
coming
his
son
had
taken
this
way
of
making
some
communication
to
him
respecting
his
political
creed
some
overture
or
some
demand
was
to
be
preferred
through
tregear
if
so
it
was
proof
of
a
certain
anxiety
as
to
the
matter
on
his
son
part
which
was
not
displeasing
to
him
but
he
was
not
left
long
in
this
mistake
after
tregear
had
entered
the
room
sir
he
said
speaking
quite
at
once
as
soon
as
the
door
was
closed
behind
him
but
still
speaking
very
slowly
looking
beautiful
as
apollo
as
he
stood
upright
before
his
sir
i
have
come
to
you
to
ask
you
to
give
me
the
hand
of
your
daughter
the
few
words
had
been
all
arranged
beforehand
and
were
now
spoken
without
any
appearance
of
fear
or
shame
no
one
hearing
them
would
have
imagined
that
an
almost
penniless
young
gentleman
was
asking
in
marriage
the
daughter
of
the
richest
and
greatest
nobleman
in
england
the
hand
of
my
daughter
said
the
duke
rising
from
his
chair
i
know
how
very
great
is
the
prize
said
frank
and
how
unworthy
i
am
of
it
but
as
she
thinks
me
worthy
she
what
she
lady
mary
she
think
you
worthy
yes
your
grace
i
do
not
believe
it
on
hearing
this
frank
simply
bowed
his
head
i
beg
your
pardon
tregear
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
i
do
not
believe
you
i
never
yet
gave
the
lie
to
a
gentleman
and
i
hope
i
never
may
be
driven
to
do
so
but
there
must
be
some
mistake
in
this
i
am
complying
with
lady
mary
wishes
in
asking
your
permission
to
enter
your
house
as
her
suitor
the
duke
stood
for
a
moment
biting
his
lips
in
silence
i
can
not
believe
it
he
said
at
last
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
believe
it
there
must
be
some
mistake
my
daughter
lady
mary
palliser
again
the
young
man
bowed
his
head
what
are
your
pretensions
simply
her
regard
of
course
it
is
impossible
you
are
not
so
ignorant
but
that
you
must
have
known
as
much
when
you
came
to
me
there
was
so
much
scorn
in
his
words
and
in
the
tone
in
which
they
were
uttered
that
tregear
in
his
turn
was
becoming
angry
he
had
prepared
himself
to
bow
humbly
before
the
great
man
before
the
duke
before
the
croesus
before
the
late
prime
minister
before
the
man
who
was
to
be
regarded
as
certainly
one
of
the
most
exalted
of
the
earth
but
he
had
not
prepared
himself
to
be
looked
at
as
the
duke
looked
at
him
the
truth
my
lord
duke
is
this
he
said
that
your
daughter
loves
me
and
that
we
are
engaged
to
each
other
as
far
as
that
engagement
can
be
made
without
your
sanction
as
her
father
it
can
not
have
been
made
at
all
said
the
duke
i
can
only
hope
we
can
both
of
us
only
hope
that
a
little
time
may
soften
it
is
out
of
the
question
there
must
be
an
end
of
this
altogether
you
must
neither
see
her
nor
hear
from
her
nor
in
any
way
communicate
with
her
it
is
altogether
impossible
i
believe
sir
that
you
have
no
means
very
little
at
present
duke
how
did
you
think
you
were
to
live
but
it
is
altogether
unnecessary
to
speak
of
such
a
matter
as
that
there
are
so
many
reasons
to
make
this
impossible
that
it
would
be
useless
to
discuss
one
as
being
more
important
than
others
has
any
other
one
of
my
family
known
of
this
this
he
added
wishing
to
ascertain
whether
lord
silverbridge
had
disgraced
himself
by
lending
his
hand
to
such
a
disposition
of
his
sister
oh
yes
said
tregear
who
has
known
it
the
duchess
sir
we
had
all
her
sympathy
and
approval
i
do
not
believe
a
word
of
it
said
the
duke
becoming
extremely
red
in
the
face
he
was
forced
to
do
now
that
which
he
had
just
declared
that
he
had
never
done
in
his
life
driven
by
the
desire
of
his
heart
to
acquit
the
wife
he
had
lost
of
the
terrible
imprudence
worse
than
imprudence
of
which
she
was
now
accused
that
is
the
second
time
my
lord
that
you
have
found
it
necessary
to
tell
me
that
you
have
not
believed
direct
assertions
which
i
made
you
but
luckily
for
me
the
two
assertions
are
capable
of
the
earliest
and
most
direct
proof
you
will
believe
lady
mary
and
she
will
confirm
me
in
the
one
and
the
other
the
duke
was
almost
beside
himself
with
emotion
and
grief
he
did
know
though
now
at
this
moment
he
was
most
loath
to
own
to
himself
that
it
was
so
that
his
dear
wife
had
been
the
most
imprudent
of
women
and
he
recognised
in
her
encouragement
of
this
most
pernicious
courtship
if
she
had
encouraged
it
a
repetition
of
that
romantic
folly
by
which
she
had
so
nearly
brought
herself
to
shipwreck
in
her
own
early
life
if
it
had
been
so
even
whether
it
had
been
so
or
not
he
had
been
wrong
to
tell
the
man
that
he
did
not
believe
him
and
the
man
had
rebuked
him
with
dignity
at
any
rate
it
is
impossible
he
repeated
i
can
not
allow
that
it
is
impossible
that
is
for
me
to
judge
sir
i
trust
that
you
will
excuse
me
when
i
say
that
i
also
must
hold
myself
to
be
in
some
degree
a
judge
in
the
matter
if
you
were
in
my
place
you
would
feel
i
could
not
possibly
be
in
your
place
if
your
grace
were
in
my
place
you
would
feel
that
as
long
as
you
were
assured
by
the
young
lady
that
your
affection
was
valued
by
her
you
would
not
be
deterred
by
the
opposition
of
her
father
that
you
should
yield
to
me
of
course
i
do
not
expect
that
lady
mary
should
be
persistent
in
her
present
feelings
when
she
knows
your
mind
perhaps
i
have
no
right
to
hope
but
should
she
be
so
persistent
as
to
make
you
feel
that
her
happiness
depends
as
mine
does
on
our
marriage
then
i
shall
believe
that
you
will
yield
at
last
never
said
the
duke
never
i
shall
never
believe
that
my
daughter
happiness
can
be
assured
by
a
step
which
i
should
regard
as
disgraceful
to
her
disgraceful
is
a
violent
word
my
lord
it
is
the
only
word
that
will
express
my
meaning
and
one
which
i
must
be
bold
enough
to
say
you
are
not
justified
in
using
should
she
become
my
wife
no
one
in
england
would
think
she
had
disgraced
herself
the
queen
would
receive
her
on
her
marriage
all
your
friends
would
hold
out
their
hands
to
us
presuming
that
we
had
your
goodwill
but
you
would
not
have
it
her
disgrace
would
not
depend
upon
that
my
lord
should
your
daughter
so
dispose
of
herself
as
to
disgrace
herself
which
i
think
to
be
impossible
your
countenance
could
not
set
her
right
nor
can
the
withdrawal
of
your
countenance
condemn
her
before
the
world
if
she
does
that
with
herself
which
any
other
lady
might
do
and
remain
a
lady
the
duke
when
he
heard
this
even
in
the
midst
of
his
wrath
which
was
very
violent
and
in
the
midst
of
his
anger
which
was
very
acute
felt
that
he
had
to
deal
with
a
man
with
one
whom
he
could
not
put
off
from
him
into
the
gutter
and
there
leave
as
buried
in
the
mud
and
there
came
too
a
feeling
upon
him
which
he
had
no
time
to
analyse
but
of
which
he
was
part
aware
that
this
terrible
indiscretion
on
the
part
of
his
daughter
and
of
his
late
wife
was
less
wonderful
than
it
had
at
first
appeared
to
be
but
not
on
that
account
was
he
the
less
determined
to
make
the
young
man
feel
that
his
parental
opposition
would
be
invincible
it
is
quite
impossible
sir
i
do
not
think
that
i
need
say
anything
more
then
while
tregear
was
meditating
whether
to
make
any
reply
the
duke
asked
a
question
which
had
better
have
been
left
unasked
the
asking
of
it
diminished
somewhat
from
that
ducal
almost
godlike
superiority
which
he
had
assumed
and
showed
the
curiosity
of
a
mere
man
has
anybody
else
been
aware
of
this
he
said
still
wishing
to
know
whether
he
had
cause
for
anger
against
silverbridge
in
the
matter
finn
is
aware
of
it
answered
tregear
mrs
finn
exclaimed
the
duke
as
though
he
had
been
stung
by
an
adder
this
was
the
woman
whom
he
had
prayed
to
remain
awhile
with
his
daughter
after
his
wife
had
been
laid
in
her
grave
in
order
that
there
might
be
someone
near
whom
he
could
trust
and
this
very
woman
whom
he
had
so
trusted
whom
in
his
early
associations
with
her
he
had
disliked
and
distrusted
but
had
taught
himself
both
to
like
and
to
trust
because
his
wife
had
loved
her
this
woman
was
the
who
had
managed
matters
between
tregear
and
his
daughter
his
wife
had
been
too
much
subject
to
her
influence
that
he
had
always
known
and
now
in
this
last
act
of
her
life
she
had
allowed
herself
to
be
persuaded
to
give
up
her
daughter
by
the
baneful
wiles
of
this
most
pernicious
woman
such
were
the
workings
of
the
duke
mind
when
the
young
man
told
him
that
finn
was
acquainted
with
the
whole
affair
as
the
reader
is
aware
nothing
could
have
been
more
unjust
i
mentioned
her
name
said
tregear
because
i
thought
she
had
been
a
friend
of
the
family
that
will
do
sir
i
have
been
greatly
pained
as
well
as
surprised
by
what
i
have
heard
of
the
real
state
of
the
case
i
can
form
no
opinion
till
i
see
my
daughter
you
of
course
will
hold
no
further
intercourse
with
her
he
paused
as
though
for
a
promise
but
tregear
did
not
feel
himself
called
upon
to
say
a
word
in
one
direction
or
in
the
other
it
will
be
my
care
that
you
shall
not
do
so
sir
tregear
who
during
the
interview
had
been
standing
then
bowed
turned
upon
his
heel
and
left
the
room
the
duke
seated
himself
and
crossing
his
arms
upon
his
chest
sat
for
an
hour
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
why
was
it
that
for
him
such
a
world
of
misery
had
been
prepared
what
wrong
had
he
done
of
what
imprudence
had
he
been
guilty
that
at
every
turn
of
life
something
should
occur
so
grievous
as
to
make
him
think
himself
the
most
wretched
of
men
no
man
had
ever
loved
his
wife
more
dearly
than
he
had
done
and
yet
now
in
that
very
excess
of
tenderness
which
her
death
had
occasioned
he
was
driven
to
accuse
her
of
a
great
sin
against
himself
in
that
she
had
kept
from
him
her
knowledge
of
this
affair
for
when
he
came
to
turn
the
matter
over
in
his
mind
he
did
believe
tregear
statement
as
to
her
encouragement
then
too
he
had
been
proud
of
his
daughter
he
was
a
man
so
reticent
and
undemonstrative
in
his
manner
that
he
had
never
known
how
to
make
confidential
friends
of
his
children
in
his
sons
hitherto
he
had
not
taken
pride
they
were
gallant
handsome
boys
with
a
certain
dash
of
cleverness
more
like
their
mother
than
their
father
but
they
had
not
as
yet
done
anything
as
he
would
have
had
them
do
it

the

in
the
perfection
of
her
beauty
in
the
quiescence
of
her
manner
in
the
nature
of
her
studies
and
in
the
general
dignity
of
her
bearing
had
seemed
to
be
all
that
he
had
desired
and
now
she
had
engaged
herself
behind
his
back
to
the
younger
son
of
a
little
county
squire

his
anger
against

was
hotter

tifto
major
tifto
had
lately
become
a
member
of
the
beargarden
club
under
the
auspices
of
his
friend
lord
silverbridge
it
was
believed
by
those
who
had
made
some
inquiry
into
the
matter
that
the
major
had
really
served
a
campaign
as
a
volunteer
in
the
carlist
army
in
the
north
of
spain
when
therefore
it
was
declared
by
someone
that
he
was
not
a
major
at
all
his
friends
were
able
to
contradict
the
assertion
and
to
impute
it
to
slander
instances
were
brought
up
declared
by
these
friends
to
be
innumerable
but
which
did
in
truth
amount
to
three
or
four
of
english
gentlemen
who
had
come
home
from
a
former
carlist
war
bearing
the
title
of
colonel
without
any
contradiction
or
invidious
remark
had
this
gallant
officer
appeared
as
colonel
tifto
perhaps
less
might
have
been
said
about
it
there
was
a
little
lack
of
courage
in
the
title
which
he
did
choose
but
it
was
accepted
at
last
and
as
major
tifto
he
was
proposed
seconded
and
elected
at
the
beargarden
but
he
had
other
points
in
his
favour
besides
the
friendship
of
lord
silverbridge
points
which
had
probably
led
to
that
friendship
he
was
without
doubt
one
of
the
best
horsemen
in
england
there
were
some
who
said
that
across
country
he
was
the
very
best
and
that
as
a
judge
of
a
hunter
few
excelled
him
of
late
years
he
had
crept
into
credit
as
a
no
one
supposed
that
he
had
much
capital
to
work
with
but
still
when
he
lost
a
bet
he
paid
it
soon
after
his
return
from
spain
he
was
chosen
as
master
of
the
runnymede
and
was
thus
enabled
to
write
the
letters
after
his
name
the
gentlemen
who
rode
with
the
runnymede
were
not
very
liberal
in
their
terms
and
had
lately
been
compelled
to
change
their
master
rather
more
frequently
than
was
good
for
that
hunt
but
now
they
had
fitted
themselves
well
how
he
was
to
hunt
the
country
five
days
a
fortnight
finding
servants
and
horses
and
feeding
the
hounds
for
eight
hundred
pounds
a
year
no
one
could
understand
but
major
tifto
not
only
undertook
to
do
it
but
did
it
and
he
actually
succeeded
in
obtaining
for
the
runnymede
a
degree
of
popularity
which
for
many
years
previous
it
had
not
possessed
such
a
man
even
though
no
one
did
know
anything
of
his
father
or
mother
though
no
one
had
ever
heard
him
speak
of
a
brother
or
a
sister
though
it
was
believed
that
he
had
no
real
income
was
felt
by
many
to
be
the
very
man
for
the
beargarden
and
when
his
name
was
brought
up
at
the
committee
lord
silverbridge
was
able
to
say
so
much
in
his
favour
that
only
two
blackballs
were
given
against
him
under
the
mild
rule
of
the
club
three
would
have
been
necessary
to
exclude
him
and
therefore
major
tifto
was
now
as
good
a
member
as
any
one
else
he
was
a
little
man
for
those
who
like
such
good
looks
he
was
and
with
regular
and
yet
not
inexpressive
features
but
his
eyes
were
small
and
never
tranquil
and
rarely
capable
of
looking
at
the
person
who
was
speaking
to
him
he
had
small
glossy
whiskers
with
the
moustache
and
the
tuft
on
his
chin
which
were
to
be
seen
anywhere
his
face
still
bore
the
freshness
of
youth
which
was
a
marvel
to
many
who
declared
that
from
facts
within
their
knowledge
tifto
must
be
far
on
the
wrong
side
of
forty
at
a
first
glance
you
would
hardly
have
called
him
thirty
no
doubt
when
on
close
inspection
you
came
to
look
into
his
eyes
you
could
see
the
hand
of
time
even
if
you
believed
the
common
assertion
that
he
painted
which
it
was
very
hard
to
believe
of
a
man
who
passed
the
most
of
his
time
in
the
or
on
a
yet
the
paint
on
his
cheeks
would
not
enable
him
to
move
with
the
elasticity
which
seemed
to
belong
to
all
his
limbs
he
rode
flat
races
and
steeple
chases
if
jump
races
may
still
be
so
called
and
with
his
own
hounds
and
with
the
queen
did
incredible
things
on
horseback
he
could
jump
over
chairs
too
the
backs
of
four
chairs
in
a
after
dinner
a
feat
which
no
gentleman
of
could
perform
even
though
he
painted
himself
ever
so
so
much
in
praise
of
major
tifto
honesty
has
compelled
the
present
chronicler
to
say
but
there
were
traits
of
character
in
which
he
fell
off
a
little
even
in
the
estimation
of
those
whose
pursuits
endeared
him
to
them
he
could
not
refrain
from
boasting
and
especially
from
boasting
about
women
his
desire
for
glory
in
that
direction
knew
no
bounds
and
he
would
sometimes
mention
names
and
bring
himself
into
trouble
it
was
told
of
him
that
at
one
period
of
his
life
when
misfortune
had
almost
overcome
him
when
sorrow
had
produced
prostration
and
prostration
some
expression
of
truth
he
had
owned
to
a
friend
his
own
conviction
that
could
he
have
kept
his
tongue
from
talking
of
women
he
might
have
risen
to
prosperity
in
his
profession
from
these
misfortunes
he
had
emerged
and
no
doubt
had
often
reflected
on
what
he
himself
had
then
said
but
we
know
that
the
drunkard
though
he
hates
drunkenness
can
not
but
drink
that
the
gambler
can
not
keep
from
the
dice
major
tifto
still
lied
about
women
and
could
not
keep
his
tongue
from
the
subject
he
would
boast
too
about
other
matters
much
to
his
own
disadvantage
he
was
too
very
deep
and
some
men
who
could
put
up
with
his
other
failings
could
not
endure
that
whatever
he
wanted
to
do
he
would
attempt
round
three
corners
though
he
could
ride
straight
he
could
do
nothing
else
straight
he
was
full
of
mysteries
if
he
wanted
to
draw
charter
wood
he
would
take
his
hounds
out
of
the
street
at
egham
directly
in
the
other
direction
if
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
ride
lord
pottlepot
horse
for
the
great
leamington
handicap
he
would
be
sure
to
tell
even
his
intimate
friends
that
he
was
almost
determined
to
take
the
baronet
offer
of
a
mount
this
he
would
do
even
where
there
was
no
possible
turn
in
the
betting
to
be
affected
by
such
falsehood
so
that
his
companions
were
apt
to
complain
that
there
was
no
knowing
where
to
have
tifto
and
then
they
who
were
old
enough
in
the
world
to
have
had
some
experience
in
men
had
perceived
that
peculiar
quality
of
his
eyes
which
never
allowed
him
to
look
any
one
in
the
face
that
major
tifto
should
make
money
by
selling
horses
was
perhaps
a
necessity
of
his
position
no
one
grumbled
at
him
because
he
did
so
or
thought
that
such
a
pursuit
was
incompatible
with
his
character
as
a
sporting
gentleman
but
there
were
some
who
considered
that
they
had
suffered
unduly
under
his
hands
and
in
their
bargains
with
him
had
been
made
to
pay
more
than
a
proper
amount
of
tax
for
the
advantages
of
his
general
assistance
when
a
man
has
perhaps
made
fifty
pounds
by
using
a
straight
tip
as
to
a
horse
at
newmarket
in
doing
which
he
had
of
course
encountered
some
risks
he
feels
he
ought
not
to
be
made
to
pay
the
amount
back
into
the
pockets
of
the
tipper
and
at
the
same
time
to
find
himself
saddled
with
the
possession
of
a
perfectly
useless
animal
in
this
way
there
were
rocks
in
the
course
through
which
tifto
was
called
on
to
steer
his
bark
of
course
he
was
anxious
when
preying
upon
his
acquaintances
to
spare
those
who
were
useful
friends
to
him
now
and
again
he
would
sell
a
serviceable
animal
at
a
fair
price
and
would
endeavour
to
make
such
sale
in
favour
of
someone
whose
countenance
would
be
a
rock
to
him
he
knew
his
business
well
but
yet
there
would
be
mistakes
now
at
this
very
moment
was
the
culmination
of
the
major
life
he
was
master
of
the
runnymede
hounds
he
was
partner
with
the
eldest
son
of
a
duke
in
the
possession
of
that
magnificent
colt
the
prime
minister
and
he
was
a
member
of
the
beargarden
he
was
a
man
who
had
often
been
despondent
about
himself
but
was
now
disposed
to
be
a
little
triumphant
he
had
finished
his
season
well
with
the
runnymede
and
were
it
not
that
let
him
work
as
he
would
his
expenses
always
exceeded
his
means
he
would
have
been
fairly
comfortable
at
eight
lord
silverbridge
and
his
friend
met
in
the
of
the
beargarden
have
you
been
here
before
asked
the
lord
not
in
here
my
lord
i
just
looked
in
at
the
last
night
glasslough
and
nidderdale
were
there
i
thought
we
should
have
got
up
a
rubber
but
they
did
seem
to
see
it
there
is
whist
here
generally
you
find
out
all
about
it
before
long
perhaps
they
are
a
little
afraid
of
you
i
the
worst
hand
at
cards
i
suppose
in
england
a
dash
at
loo
for
about
an
hour
and
cuts
at
blind
hookey
about
my
form
i
know
i
drop
more
than
i
pick
up
if
i
knew
what
i
was
about
i
should
never
touch
a
card
horses
eh
tifto
horses
yes
they
pretty
good
claret
here
eh
silverbridge
he
could
never
hit
off
his
familiarity
quite
right
he
had
his
young
friend
at
first
and
now
brought
out
the
name
with
a
hesitating
twang
which
the
young
nobleman
appreciated
but
then
the
young
nobleman
was
quite
aware
that
the
major
was
a
friend
for
club
purposes
and
sporting
purposes
and
not
for
home
use
everything
of
that
kind
is
pretty
good
here
said
the
lord
you
were
saying
horses
i
dare
say
you
do
better
with
them
than
with
cards
if
i
did
i
do
know
where
i
should
be
seeing
what
a
lot
pass
through
my
hands
in
the
year
any
one
of
our
fellows
who
has
a
horse
to
sell
thinks
that
i
am
bound
to
buy
him
and
i
do
buy
last
may
i
had
hunters
on
my
hands
how
many
of
them
have
you
got
now
three
three
of
that
lot
though
a
goodish
many
have
come
up
since
but
what
does
it
amount
to
when
i
have
anything
that
is
very
good
some
fellow
that
i
like
gets
him
from
me
after
paying
for
him
after
paying
for
him
yes
i
do
mean
that
i
make
a
fellow
a
present
but
the
man
who
buys
has
a
deal
the
best
of
it
did
you
ever
get
anything
better
than
that
spotted
chestnut
in
your
life
what
old
sarcinet
you
had
her
for
one
hundred
and
sixty
pounds
now
if
you
were
on
your
oath
what
is
she
worth
she
suits
me
major
and
of
course
i
should
sell
her
i
rather
think
not
i
knew
what
that
mare
was
well
enough
a
dealer
would
have
had
three
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
for
her
i
could
have
got
the
money
easily
if
i
had
taken
her
down
into
the
shires
and
ridden
her
a
day
or
two
myself
i
gave
you
what
you
asked
yes
you
did
it
is
often
that
i
take
less
than
i
ask
but
the
fact
is
about
horses
i
do
know
whether
i
should
do
better
if
i
never
owned
an
animal
at
all
but
those
i
want
for
my
own
use
when
i
am
dealing
with
a
man
i
call
a
friend
i
ca
bear
to
make
money
of
him
i
do
think
fellows
give
me
all
the
credit
they
should
do
for
sticking
to
them
the
major
as
he
said
this
leaned
back
in
his
chair
put
his
hand
up
to
his
moustache
and
looked
sadly
away
into
the
vacancy
of
the
room
as
though
he
was
meditating
sorrowfully
on
the
ingratitude
of
the
world
i
suppose
it
all
right
about
cream
cheese
asked
the
lord
well
it
ought
to
be
and
now
the
major
spoke
like
an
oracle
leaning
forward
on
the
table
uttering
his
words
in
a
low
voice
but
very
plainly
so
that
not
a
syllable
might
be
lost
when
you
remember
how
he
ran
at
the
craven
with
lb
on
him
that
it
took
archbishop
all
he
knew
to
beat
him
with
only
and
what
the
lot
at
chester
are
likely
to
be
i
do
think
that
there
can
be
seven
to
one
against
him
i
should
be
very
glad
to
take
it
off
your
hands
only
the
figures
are
a
little
too
heavy
for
me
i
suppose
sunflower
be
the
best
animal
there
not
a
doubt
of
it
if
he
all
right
and
if
his
temper
will
stand
think
what
a
course
chester
is
for
an
brute
like
that
and
then
he
the
most
uncertain
horse
in
training
there
are
times
he
wo
feed
from
what
i
hear
i
should
wonder
if
he
turn
up
at
all
solomon
says
he
all
right
you
wo
get
solomon
to
take
four
to
one
against
him
nor
yet
four
and
a
half
i
suppose
you
go
down
my
lord
well
yes
if
there
nothing
else
doing
just
then
i
do
know
how
it
may
be
about
this
electioneering
business
i
shall
go
and
smoke
upstairs
at
the
beargarden
there
were
i
was
going
to
say
two
but
in
truth
the
house
was
a
all
over
it
was
however
the
custom
of
those
who
habitually
played
cards
to
have
their
cigars
and
coffee
upstairs
into
this
sanctum
major
tifto
had
not
yet
been
introduced
but
now
he
was
taken
there
under
lord
wing
there
were
already
four
or
five
assembled
among
whom
was
adolphus
longstaff
a
young
man
of
about
years
of
age
who
spent
very
much
of
his
time
at
the
beargarden
do
you
know
my
friend
tifto
said
the
lord
tifto
this
is
longstaff
whom
men
within
the
walls
of
this
asylum
sometimes
call
dolly
whereupon
the
major
bowed
and
smiled
graciously
i
have
heard
of
major
tifto
said
dolly
who
has
not
said
lord
nidderdale
another
young
man
who
made
one
of
the
company
again
the
major
bowed
last
season
i
was
always
intending
to
get
down
to
your
country
and
have
a
day
with
the
tiftoes
said
dolly
do
they
call
your
hounds
the
tiftoes
they
shall
be
called
so
if
you
like
said
the
major
and
why
did
you
come
it
always
was
such
a
grind
train
down
from
paddington
every
day
at
ten
that
all
very
well
if
you
happen
to
be
up
well
silverbridge
how
the
prime
minister
how
is
he
tifto
asked
the
noble
partner
i
do
think
there
a
man
in
england
just
at
present
enjoying
a
very
much
better
state
of
health
said
the
major
pleasantly
safe
to
run
asked
dolly
safe
to
run
why
should
he
be
safe
to
run
i
mean
sure
to
start
i
think
we
mean
him
to
start
do
we
silverbridge
said
the
major
there
was
something
perhaps
in
the
tone
in
which
the
last
remark
was
made
which
jarred
a
little
against
the
young
lord
dignity
at
any
rate
he
got
up
and
declared
his
purpose
of
going
to
the
opera
he
should
look
in
he
said
and
hear
a
song
from
mdlle
stuffa
mdlle
stuffa
was
the
nightingale
of
the
season
and
lord
silverbridge
when
he
had
nothing
else
to
do
would
sometimes
think
that
he
was
fond
of
music
soon
after
he
was
gone
major
tifto
had
some
lit
his
third
cigar
and
began
to
feel
the
glory
of
belonging
to
the
beargarden
with
lord
silverbridge
to
whom
it
was
essentially
necessary
that
he
should
make
himself
agreeable
at
all
times
he
was
somewhat
overweighted
as
it
were
though
he
attempted
an
easy
familiarity
he
was
a
little
afraid
of
lord
silverbridge
with
dolly
longstaff
he
felt
that
he
might
be
comfortable
not
perhaps
understanding
that
gentleman
character
with
lord
nidderdale
he
had
previously
been
acquainted
and
had
found
him
to
be
so
as
he
sipped
his
whisky
he
became
confidential
and
comfortable
i
never
thought
so
much
about
her
good
looks
he
said
they
were
talking
of
the
singer
the
charms
of
whose
voice
had
carried
lord
silverbridge
away
did
you
ever
see
her
off
the
stage
asked
nidderdale
oh
dear
yes
she
does
not
go
about
very
much
i
fancy
said
someone
i
dare
say
not
said
tifto
but
she
and
i
have
had
a
day
or
two
together
for
all
that
you
must
have
been
very
much
favoured
said
dolly
we
been
pals
ever
since
she
has
been
over
here
said
tifto
with
an
enormous
lie
how
do
you
get
on
with
her
husband
asked
dolly
in
the
simplest
voice
as
though
not
in
the
least
surprised
at
his
statement
husband
exclaimed
the
major
who
was
not
possessed
of
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
suppress
all
signs
of
his
ignorance
ah
said
dolly
you
are
not
probably
aware
that
your
pal
has
been
married
to
thomas
jones
for
the
last
year
and
a
half
soon
after
that
major
tifto
left
the
club
with
considerably
enhanced
respect
for
longstaff
chapter
vii
conservative
convictions
lord
silverbridge
had
engaged
himself
to
be
with
his
father
the
next
morning
at
nine
and
he
entered
the
a
very
few
minutes
after
that
hour
he
had
made
up
his
mind
as
to
what
he
would
say
to
his
father
he
meant
to
call
himself
a
conservative
and
to
go
into
the
house
of
commons
under
that
denomination
all
the
men
among
whom
he
lived
were
conservatives
it
was
a
matter
on
which
as
he
thought
his
father
could
have
no
right
to
control
him
down
in
barsetshire
as
well
as
up
in
london
there
was
some
little
difference
of
opinion
in
this
matter
the
people
of
silverbridge
declared
that
they
would
prefer
to
have
a
conservative
member
as
indeed
they
had
one
for
the
last
session
they
had
loyally
returned
the
duke
himself
while
he
was
a
commoner
but
they
had
returned
him
as
being
part
and
parcel
of
the
omnium
appendages
that
was
all
over
now
as
a
constituency
they
were
not
endowed
with
advanced
views
and
thought
that
a
conservative
would
suit
them
best
that
being
so
and
as
they
had
been
told
that
the
duke
son
was
a
conservative
they
fancied
that
by
electing
him
they
would
be
pleasing
everybody
but
in
truth
by
so
doing
they
would
by
no
means
please
the
duke
he
had
told
them
on
previous
occasions
that
they
might
elect
whom
they
pleased
and
felt
no
anger
because
they
had
elected
a
conservative
they
might
send
up
to
parliament
the
most
antediluvian
old
tory
they
could
find
in
england
if
they
wished
only
not
his
son
not
a
palliser
as
a
tory
or
conservative
and
then
though
the
little
town
had
gone
back
in
the
ways
of
the
world
the
county
or
the
division
of
the
county
had
made
so
much
progress
that
a
liberal
candidate
recommended
by
him
would
almost
certainly
be
returned
it
was
just
the
occasion
on
which
a
palliser
should
show
himself
ready
to
serve
his
country
there
would
be
an
expense
but
he
would
think
nothing
of
expense
in
such
a
matter
ten
thousand
pounds
spent
on
such
an
object
would
not
vex
him
the
very
contest
would
have
given
him
new
life
all
this
lord
silverbridge
understood
but
had
said
to
himself
and
to
all
his
friends
that
it
was
a
matter
in
which
he
did
not
intend
to
be
controlled
the
duke
had
passed
a
very
unhappy
night
he
had
told
himself
that
any
such
marriage
as
that
spoken
of
was
out
of
the
question
he
believed
that
the
matter
might
be
so
represented
to
his
girl
as
to
make
her
feel
that
it
was
out
of
the
question
he
hardly
doubted
but
that
he
could
stamp
it
out
though
he
should
have
to
take
her
away
into
some
further
corner
of
the
world
he
would
stamp
it
out
but
she
when
this
foolish
passion
of
hers
should
have
been
thus
stamped
out
could
never
be
the
pure
the
bright
the
unsullied
unsoiled
thing
of
the
possession
of
which
he
had
thought
so
much
he
had
never
spoken
of
his
hopes
about
her
even
to
his
wife
but
in
the
silence
of
his
very
silent
life
he
had
thought
much
of
the
day
when
he
would
give
her
to
some
noble
youth
noble
with
all
gifts
of
nobility
including
rank
and
wealth
who
might
be
fit
to
receive
her
now
even
though
no
one
else
should
know
it
and
all
would
know
it
she
would
be
the
girl
who
had
condescended
to
love
young
tregear
his
own
duchess
she
whose
loss
to
him
now
was
as
though
he
had
lost
half
his
limbs
had
not
she
in
the
same
way
loved
a
tregear
or
worse
than
a
tregear
in
her
early
days
ah
yes
and
though
his
cora
had
been
so
much
to
him
had
he
not
often
felt
had
he
not
been
feeling
all
his
days
that
fate
had
robbed
him
of
the
sweetest
joy
that
is
given
to
man
in
that
she
had
not
come
to
him
loving
him
with
her
early
spring
of
love
as
she
had
loved
that
poor
how
infinite
had
been
his
regrets
how
often
had
he
told
himself
that
with
all
that
fortune
had
given
him
still
fortune
had
been
unjust
to
him
because
he
had
been
robbed
of
that
not
to
save
his
life
could
he
have
whispered
a
word
of
this
to
any
one
but
he
had
felt
it
he
had
felt
it
for
years
dear
as
she
had
been
she
had
not
been
quite
what
she
should
have
been
but
for
that
and
now
this
girl
of
his
who
was
so
much
dearer
to
him
than
anything
else
left
to
him
was
doing
exactly
as
her
mother
had
done
the
young
man
might
be
stamped
out
he
might
be
made
to
vanish
as
that
other
young
man
had
vanished
but
the
fact
that
he
had
been
there
cherished
in
the
girl
heart
that
could
not
be
stamped
out
he
struggled
gallantly
to
acquit
the
memory
of
his
wife
he
could
best
do
that
by
leaning
with
the
full
weight
of
his
mind
on
the
presumed
iniquity
of
finn
had
he
not
known
from
the
first
that
the
woman
was
an
adventuress
and
had
he
not
declared
to
himself
over
and
over
again
that
between
such
a
one
and
himself
there
should
be
no
intercourse
no
common
feeling
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
talked
into
an
intimacy
to
be
talked
almost
into
an
affection
and
this
was
the
result
and
how
should
he
treat
this
matter
in
his
coming
interview
with
his
son
or
should
he
make
an
allusion
to
it
at
first
it
seemed
as
though
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
give
his
mind
to
that
other
subject
how
could
he
enforce
the
merits
of
political
liberalism
and
the
duty
of
adhering
to
the
old
family
party
while
his
mind
was
entirely
preoccupied
with
his
daughter
it
had
suddenly
become
almost
indifferent
to
him
whether
silverbridge
should
be
a
conservative
or
a
liberal
but
as
he
dressed
he
told
himself
that
as
a
man
he
ought
to
be
able
to
do
a
plain
duty
marked
out
for
him
as
this
had
been
by
his
own
judgment
without
regard
to
personal
suffering
the
hedger
and
ditcher
must
make
his
hedge
and
clean
his
ditch
even
though
he
be
tormented
by
rheumatism
his
duty
by
his
son
he
must
do
even
though
his
heart
were
torn
to
pieces
during
breakfast
he
tried
to
be
gracious
and
condescended
to
ask
his
son
a
question
about
prime
minister
racing
was
an
amusement
to
which
english
noblemen
had
been
addicted
for
many
ages
and
had
been
held
to
be
serviceable
rather
than
disgraceful
if
conducted
in
a
noble
fashion
he
did
not
credit
tifto
with
much
nobility
he
knew
but
little
about
the
major
he
would
much
have
preferred
that
his
son
should
have
owned
a
horse
alone
if
he
must
have
anything
to
do
with
ownership
would
it
not
be
better
to
buy
the
other
share
asked
the
duke
it
would
take
a
deal
of
money
sir
the
major
would
ask
a
couple
of
thousand
i
should
think
that
is
a
great
deal
and
then
the
major
is
a
very
useful
man
he
thoroughly
understands
the
turf
i
hope
he
does
live
by
it
oh
no
he
does
live
by
it
that
is
he
has
a
great
many
irons
in
the
fire
i
do
not
mind
a
young
man
owning
a
horse
if
he
can
afford
the
expense
as
you
perhaps
can
do
but
i
hope
you
do
bet
nothing
to
speak
of
nothing
to
speak
of
is
so
apt
to
grow
into
that
which
has
to
be
spoken
of
so
much
the
father
said
at
breakfast
hardly
giving
his
mind
to
the
matter
discussed
his
mind
being
on
other
things
but
when
their
breakfast
was
eaten
then
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
begin
silverbridge
he
said
i
hope
you
have
thought
better
of
what
we
were
talking
about
as
to
these
coming
elections
well
sir
of
course
i
have
thought
about
it
and
you
can
do
as
i
would
have
you
you
see
sir
a
man
political
opinion
is
a
kind
of
thing
he
get
rid
of
you
can
hardly
as
yet
have
any
very
confirmed
political
opinion
you
are
still
young
and
i
do
not
suppose
that
you
have
thought
much
about
politics
well
sir
i
think
i
have
i
got
my
own
ideas
we
got
to
protect
our
position
as
well
as
we
can
against
the
radicals
and
communists
i
can
not
admit
that
at
all
silverbridge
there
is
no
great
political
party
in
this
country
anxious
either
for
communism
or
for
revolution
but
putting
all
that
aside
for
the
present
do
you
think
that
a
man
political
opinions
should
be
held
in
regard
to
his
own
individual
interests
or
to
the
much
wider
interests
of
others
whom
we
call
the
public
to
his
own
interest
said
the
young
man
with
decision
it
is
simply
then
his
own
and
his
class
the
people
will
look
after
themselves
and
we
must
look
after
ourselves
we
are
so
few
and
they
are
so
many
that
we
shall
have
quite
enough
to
do
then
the
duke
gave
his
son
a
somewhat
lengthy
political
lecture
which
was
intended
to
teach
him
that
the
greatest
benefit
of
the
greatest
number
was
the
object
to
which
all
political
studies
should
tend
the
son
listened
to
it
with
attention
and
when
it
was
over
expressed
his
opinion
that
there
was
a
great
deal
in
what
his
father
had
said
i
trust
if
you
will
consider
it
said
the
duke
that
you
will
not
find
yourself
obliged
to
desert
the
school
of
politics
in
which
your
father
has
not
been
an
inactive
supporter
and
to
which
your
family
has
belonged
for
many
generations
i
could
not
call
myself
a
liberal
said
the
young
politician
why
not
because
i
am
a
conservative
and
you
wo
stand
for
the
county
on
the
liberal
interest
i
should
be
obliged
to
tell
them
that
i
should
always
give
a
conservative
vote
then
you
refuse
to
do
what
i
ask
i
do
not
know
how
i
can
help
refusing
if
you
wanted
me
to
grow
a
couple
of
inches
taller
i
could
do
it
even
though
i
should
be
ever
so
anxious
to
oblige
you
but
a
very
young
man
as
you
are
may
have
so
much
deference
for
his
elders
as
to
be
induced
to
believe
that
he
has
been
in
error
oh
yes
of
course
you
can
not
but
be
aware
that
the
political
condition
of
the
country
is
the
one
subject
to
which
i
have
devoted
the
labour
of
my
life
i
know
that
very
well
and
of
course
i
know
how
much
they
all
think
of
you
then
my
opinion
might
go
for
something
with
you
so
it
does
sir
i
should
have
doubted
at
all
only
for
that
little
still
you
see
as
the
thing
is
how
am
i
to
help
myself
you
believe
that
you
must
be
right
you
who
have
never
given
an
hour
study
to
the
subject
no
sir
in
comparison
with
a
great
many
men
i
know
that
i
am
a
fool
perhaps
it
is
because
i
know
that
that
i
am
a
conservative
the
radicals
are
always
saying
that
a
conservative
must
be
a
fool
then
a
fool
ought
to
be
a
conservative
hereupon
the
father
got
up
from
his
chair
and
turned
round
facing
the
fire
with
his
back
to
his
son
he
was
becoming
very
angry
but
endeavoured
to
restrain
his
anger
the
matter
in
dispute
between
them
was
of
so
great
importance
that
he
could
hardly
be
justified
in
abandoning
it
in
consequence
of
arguments
so
trifling
in
themselves
as
these
which
his
son
adduced
as
he
stood
there
for
some
minutes
thinking
of
it
all
he
was
tempted
again
and
again
to
burst
out
in
wrath
and
threaten
the
lad
to
threaten
him
as
to
money
as
to
his
amusements
as
to
the
general
tenure
of
his
life
the
pity
was
so
great
that
the
lad
should
be
so
stubborn
and
so
foolish
he
would
never
ask
his
son
to
be
a
slave
to
the
liberal
party
as
he
had
been
but
that
a
palliser
should
not
be
a
liberal
and
his
son
as
the
first
recreant
palliser
was
wormwood
to
him
as
he
stood
there
he
more
than
once
clenched
his
fist
in
eager
desire
to
turn
upon
the
young
man
but
he
restrained
himself
telling
himself
that
in
justice
he
should
not
be
angry
for
such
offence
as
this
to
become
a
conservative
when
the
path
to
liberalism
was
so
fairly
open
might
be
the
part
of
a
fool
but
could
not
fairly
be
imputed
as
a
crime
to
endeavour
to
be
just
was
the
study
of
his
life
and
in
no
condition
of
life
can
justice
be
more
imperatively
due
than
from
a
father
to
his
son
you
mean
to
stand
for
silverbridge
he
said
at
last
not
if
you
object
sir
this
made
it
worse
it
became
now
still
more
difficult
for
him
to
scold
the
young
man
you
are
aware
that
i
should
not
meddle
in
any
way
that
was
what
i
supposed
they
will
return
a
conservative
at
any
rate
it
is
not
that
i
care
about
said
the
duke
sadly
upon
my
word
sir
i
am
very
sorry
to
vex
you
but
what
would
you
have
me
do
i
will
give
up
parliament
altogether
if
you
say
that
you
wish
it
no
i
do
not
wish
that
you
would
have
me
tell
a
lie
no
what
can
i
do
then
learn
what
there
is
to
learn
from
some
master
fit
to
teach
you
there
are
so
many
masters
i
believe
it
to
be
that
most
arrogant
young
man
who
was
with
me
yesterday
who
has
done
this
evil
you
mean
frank
tregear
i
do
mean
mr
tregear
he
a
conservative
of
course
and
of
course
he
and
i
have
been
much
together
was
he
with
you
yesterday
sir
yes
he
was
what
was
that
about
asked
lord
silverbridge
in
a
voice
that
almost
betrayed
fear
for
he
knew
very
well
what
cause
had
produced
the
interview
he
has
been
speaking
to
me
when
the
duke
had
got
so
far
as
this
he
paused
finding
himself
to
be
hardly
able
to
declare
the
disgrace
which
had
fallen
upon
himself
and
his
family
as
he
did
tell
the
story
both
his
face
and
his
voice
were
altered
so
that
the
son
in
truth
was
scared
he
has
been
speaking
to
me
about
your
sister
did
you
know
of
this
i
knew
there
was
something
between
them
and
you
encouraged
it
no
sir
just
the
contrary
i
have
told
him
that
i
was
quite
sure
it
would
never
do
and
why
did
you
not
tell
me
well
sir
that
was
hardly
my
business
was
it
not
to
guard
the
honour
of
your
sister
you
see
sir
how
many
things
have
happened
all
at
once
what
things
my
dear
mother
sir
thought
well
of
him
the
duke
uttered
a
deep
sigh
and
turned
again
round
to
the
fire
i
always
told
him
that
you
would
never
consent
i
should
think
not
it
has
come
so
suddenly
i
should
have
spoken
to
you
about
it
as
soon
as
as
soon
as
he
had
meant
to
say
as
soon
as
the
grief
for
the
loss
of
his
wife
had
been
in
some
degree
appeased
but
he
could
not
speak
the
words
the
duke
however
perfectly
understood
him
in
the
meantime
they
were
not
seeing
each
other
nor
writing
i
think
not
finn
has
known
it
all
mrs
finn
certainly
she
has
known
it
all
through
i
do
not
see
how
it
can
have
been
so
he
told
me
so
himself
said
the
duke
unwittingly
putting
words
into
tregear
mouth
which
tregear
had
never
uttered
there
must
be
an
end
of
this
i
will
speak
to
your
sister
in
the
meantime
the
less
i
think
you
see
of
tregear
the
better
of
course
it
is
out
of
the
question
he
should
be
allowed
to
remain
in
this
house
you
will
make
him
understand
that
at
once
if
you
please
oh
certainly
said
silverbridge
chapter
viii
he
is
a
gentleman
the
duke
returned
to
matching
an
almost
man
he
had
intended
to
go
down
into
barsetshire
in
reference
to
the
coming
elections
not
with
the
view
of
interfering
in
any
unlordly
or
rather
unpeerlike
fashion
but
thinking
that
if
his
eldest
son
were
to
stand
for
the
county
in
a
proper
constitutional
spirit
as
the
eldest
son
of
so
great
a
county
magnate
ought
to
do
his
presence
at
gatherum
castle
among
his
own
people
might
probably
be
serviceable
and
would
certainly
be
gracious
there
would
be
no
question
of
entertainment
his
bereavement
would
make
that
impossible
but
there
would
come
from
his
presence
a
certain
savour
of
proprietorship
and
a
sense
of
power
which
would
be
beneficial
to
his
son
and
would
not
as
the
duke
thought
be
contrary
to
the
spirit
of
the
constitution
but
all
this
was
now
at
an
end
he
told
himself
that
he
did
not
care
how
the
elections
might
go
that
he
did
not
care
much
how
anything
might
go
silverbridge
might
stand
for
silverbridge
if
he
so
pleased
he
would
give
neither
assistance
nor
obstruction
either
in
the
county
or
in
the
borough
he
wrote
to
this
effect
to
his
agent
morton
but
at
the
same
time
desired
that
gentleman
to
pay
lord
silverbridge
electioneering
expenses
feeling
it
to
be
his
duty
as
a
father
to
do
so
much
for
his
son
but
though
he
endeavoured
to
engage
his
thoughts
in
these
parliamentary
matters
though
he
tried
to
make
himself
believe
that
this
political
apostasy
was
the
trouble
which
vexed
him
in
truth
that
other
misery
was
so
crushing
as
to
make
the
affairs
of
his
son
insignificant
how
should
he
express
himself
to
her
that
was
the
thought
present
to
his
mind
as
he
went
down
to
matching
should
he
content
himself
with
simply
telling
her
that
such
a
wish
on
her
part
was
disgraceful
and
that
it
could
never
be
fulfilled
or
should
he
argue
the
matter
with
her
endeavouring
as
he
did
so
to
persuade
her
gently
that
she
was
wrong
to
place
her
affections
so
low
and
so
to
obtain
from
her
an
assurance
that
the
idea
should
be
abandoned
the
latter
course
would
be
infinitely
the
better
if
only
he
could
accomplish
it
but
he
was
conscious
of
his
own
hardness
of
manner
and
was
aware
that
he
had
never
succeeded
in
establishing
confidence
between
himself
and
his
daughter
it
was
a
thing
for
which
he
had
longed
as
a
plain
girl
might
long
to
possess
the
charms
of
an
acknowledged
beauty
as
a
poor
little
fellow
five
feet
in
height
might
long
to
have
a
cubit
added
to
his
stature
though
he
was
angry
with
her
how
willingly
would
he
take
her
into
his
arms
and
assure
her
of
his
forgiveness
how
anxious
he
would
be
to
make
her
understand
that
nothing
should
be
spared
by
him
to
add
beauty
and
grace
to
her
life
only
as
a
matter
of
course
tregear
must
be
abandoned
but
he
knew
of
himself
that
he
would
not
know
how
to
begin
to
be
tender
and
forgiving
he
knew
that
he
would
not
know
how
not
to
be
stern
and
hard
but
he
must
find
out
the
history
of
it
all
no
doubt
the
man
had
been
his
son
friend
and
had
joined
his
party
in
italy
at
his
instance
but
yet
he
had
come
to
entertain
an
idea
that
finn
had
been
the
great
promoter
of
the
sin
and
he
thought
that
tregear
had
told
him
that
that
lady
had
been
concerned
with
the
matter
from
the
beginning
in
all
this
there
was
a
craving
in
his
heart
to
lessen
the
amount
of
culpable
responsibility
which
might
seem
to
attach
itself
to
the
wife
he
had
lost
he
reached
matching
about
eight
and
ordered
his
dinner
to
be
brought
to
him
in
his
own
study
when
lady
mary
came
to
welcome
him
he
kissed
her
forehead
and
bade
her
come
to
him
after
his
dinner
shall
i
not
sit
with
you
papa
whilst
you
are
eating
it
she
asked
but
he
merely
told
her
that
he
would
not
trouble
her
to
do
that
even
in
saying
this
he
was
so
unusually
tender
to
her
that
she
assured
herself
that
her
lover
had
not
as
yet
told
his
tale
the
duke
meals
were
not
generally
feasts
for
a
lucullus
no
man
living
perhaps
cared
less
what
he
ate
or
knew
less
what
he
drank
in
such
matters
he
took
what
was
provided
for
him
making
his
dinner
off
the
first
bit
of
meat
that
was
brought
and
simply
ignoring
anything
offered
to
him
afterwards
and
he
would
drink
what
wine
the
servant
gave
him
mixing
it
whatever
it
might
be
with
seltzer
water
he
had
never
been
much
given
to
the
pleasures
of
the
table
but
this
habit
of
simplicity
had
grown
on
him
of
late
till
the
duchess
used
to
tell
him
that
his
wants
were
so
few
that
it
was
a
pity
he
was
not
a
hermit
vowed
to
poverty
very
shortly
a
message
was
brought
to
lady
mary
saying
that
her
father
wished
to
see
her
she
went
at
once
and
found
him
seated
on
a
sofa
which
stood
close
along
the
bookshelves
on
one
side
of
the
room
the
table
had
already
been
cleared
and
he
was
alone
he
not
only
was
alone
but
had
not
even
a
pamphlet
or
newspaper
in
his
hand
then
she
knew
that
tregear
must
have
told
the
story
as
this
occurred
to
her
her
legs
almost
gave
way
under
her
come
and
sit
down
mary
he
said
pointing
to
the
seat
on
the
sofa
beside
himself
she
sat
down
and
took
one
of
his
hands
within
her
own
then
as
he
did
not
begin
at
once
she
asked
a
question
will
silverbridge
stand
for
the
county
papa
no
my
dear
but
for
the
town
yes
my
dear
and
he
wo
be
a
liberal
i
am
afraid
not
it
is
a
cause
of
great
unhappiness
to
me
but
i
do
not
know
that
i
should
be
justified
in
any
absolute
opposition
a
man
is
entitled
to
his
own
opinion
even
though
he
be
a
very
young
man
i
am
so
sorry
that
it
should
be
so
papa
because
it
vexes
you
i
have
many
things
to
vex
me
things
to
break
my
heart
poor
mamma
she
exclaimed
yes
that
above
all
others
but
life
and
death
are
in
god
hands
and
even
though
we
may
complain
we
can
alter
nothing
but
whatever
our
sorrows
are
while
we
are
here
we
must
do
our
duty
i
suppose
he
may
be
a
good
member
of
parliament
though
he
has
turned
conservative
i
am
not
thinking
about
your
brother
i
am
thinking
about
you
the
poor
girl
gave
a
little
start
on
the
sofa
do
you
know
mr
tregear
he
added
yes
papa
of
course
i
know
him
you
used
to
see
him
in
italy
i
believe
i
did
i
understand
that
he
was
there
as
a
friend
of
silverbridge
his
most
intimate
friend
papa
i
dare
say
he
came
to
me
in
london
yesterday
and
told
me
oh
mary
can
it
be
true
yes
papa
she
said
covered
up
to
her
forehead
with
blushes
and
with
her
eyes
turned
down
in
the
ordinary
affairs
of
life
she
was
a
girl
of
great
courage
who
was
not
given
to
be
shaken
from
her
constancy
by
the
pressure
of
any
present
difficulty
but
now
the
terror
inspired
by
her
father
voice
almost
overpowered
her
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
have
engaged
yourself
to
that
young
man
without
my
approval
of
course
you
were
to
have
been
asked
papa
is
that
in
accordance
with
your
idea
of
what
should
be
the
conduct
of
a
young
lady
in
your
position
nobody
meant
to
conceal
anything
from
you
papa
it
has
been
so
far
concealed
and
yet
this
young
man
has
the
to
come
to
me
and
to
demand
your
hand
as
though
it
were
a
matter
of
course
that
i
should
accede
to
so
trivial
a
request
it
is
as
a
matter
of
course
quite
impossible
you
understand
that
do
you
not
when
she
did
not
answer
him
at
once
he
repeated
the
question
i
ask
you
whether
you
do
not
feel
that
it
is
altogether
impossible
no
papa
she
said
in
the
lowest
possible
whisper
but
still
in
such
a
whisper
that
he
could
hear
the
word
and
with
so
much
clearness
that
he
could
judge
from
her
voice
of
the
obstinacy
of
her
mind
then
mary
it
becomes
my
duty
to
tell
you
that
it
is
quite
impossible
i
will
not
have
it
thought
of
there
must
be
an
end
of
it
why
papa
why
i
am
astonished
that
you
should
ask
me
why
i
should
not
have
allowed
him
papa
to
go
to
you
unless
i
had
unless
i
had
loved
him
then
you
must
conquer
your
love
it
is
disgraceful
and
must
be
conquered
disgraceful
yes
i
am
sorry
to
use
such
a
word
to
my
own
child
but
it
is
so
if
you
will
promise
to
be
guided
by
me
in
this
matter
if
you
will
undertake
not
to
see
him
any
more
i
will
if
not
forget
it
at
any
rate
pardon
it
and
be
silent
i
will
excuse
it
because
you
were
young
and
were
thrown
imprudently
in
his
way
there
has
i
believe
been
someone
at
work
in
the
matter
with
whom
i
ought
to
be
more
angry
than
with
you
say
that
you
will
obey
me
and
there
is
nothing
within
a
father
power
that
i
will
not
do
for
you
to
make
your
life
happy
it
was
thus
that
he
strove
not
to
be
stern
his
heart
indeed
was
tender
enough
but
there
was
nothing
tender
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
or
in
the
glance
of
his
eye
though
he
was
very
positive
in
what
he
said
yet
he
was
shy
and
shamefaced
even
with
his
own
daughter
he
too
had
blushed
when
he
told
her
that
she
must
conquer
her
love
that
she
should
be
told
that
she
had
disgraced
herself
was
terrible
to
her
that
her
father
should
speak
of
her
marriage
with
this
man
as
an
event
that
was
impossible
made
her
very
unhappy
that
he
should
talk
of
pardoning
her
as
for
some
great
fault
was
in
itself
a
misery
but
she
had
not
on
that
account
the
least
idea
of
giving
up
her
lover
young
as
she
was
she
had
her
own
peculiar
theory
on
that
matter
her
own
code
of
conduct
and
honour
from
which
she
did
not
mean
to
be
driven
of
course
she
had
not
expected
that
her
father
would
yield
at
the
first
word
he
no
doubt
would
wish
that
she
should
make
a
more
exalted
marriage
she
had
known
that
she
would
have
to
encounter
opposition
though
she
had
not
expected
to
be
told
that
she
had
disgraced
herself
as
she
sat
there
she
resolved
that
under
no
pretence
would
she
give
up
her
lover
but
she
was
so
far
abashed
that
she
could
not
find
words
to
express
herself
he
too
had
been
silent
for
a
few
moments
before
he
again
asked
her
for
her
promise
will
you
tell
me
mary
that
you
will
not
see
him
again
i
do
think
that
i
can
say
that
papa
why
not
oh
papa
how
can
i
when
of
all
the
people
in
the
world
i
love
him
the
best
it
is
not
without
a
pang
that
any
one
can
be
told
that
she
who
is
of
all
the
dearest
has
some
other
one
who
to
her
is
the
dearest
such
pain
fathers
and
mothers
have
to
bear
and
though
i
think
the
arrow
is
never
so
blunted
but
that
it
leaves
something
of
a
wound
behind
there
is
in
most
cases
if
not
a
perfect
salve
still
an
ample
consolation
the
mother
knows
that
it
is
good
that
her
child
should
love
some
man
better
than
all
the
world
beside
and
that
she
should
be
taken
away
to
become
a
wife
and
a
mother
and
the
father
when
that
delight
of
his
eyes
ceases
to
assure
him
that
he
is
her
nearest
and
dearest
though
he
abandon
the
treasure
of
that
nearestness
and
dearestness
with
a
soft
melancholy
still
knows
that
it
is
as
it
should
be
of
course
that
other
him
is
the
person
she
loves
the
best
in
the
world
were
it
not
so
how
evil
a
thing
it
would
be
that
she
should
marry
him
were
it
not
so
with
reference
to
some
him
how
void
would
her
life
be
but
now
to
the
poor
duke
the
wound
had
no
salve
no
consolation
when
he
was
told
that
this
young
tregear
was
the
owner
of
his
girl
sweet
love
was
the
treasure
of
her
heart
he
shrank
as
though
arrows
with
sharp
points
were
pricking
him
all
over
i
will
not
hear
of
such
love
he
said
what
am
i
to
say
papa
say
that
you
will
obey
me
then
she
sat
silent
do
you
not
know
that
he
is
not
fit
to
be
your
husband
no
papa
then
you
can
not
have
thought
much
either
of
your
position
or
of
mine
he
is
a
gentleman
papa
so
is
my
private
secretary
there
is
not
a
clerk
in
one
of
our
public
offices
who
does
not
consider
himself
to
be
a
gentleman
the
curate
of
the
parish
is
a
gentleman
and
the
medical
man
who
comes
here
from
bradstock
the
word
is
too
vague
to
carry
with
it
any
meaning
that
ought
to
be
serviceable
to
you
in
thinking
of
such
a
matter
i
do
not
know
any
other
way
of
dividing
people
said
she
showing
thereby
that
she
had
altogether
made
up
her
mind
as
to
what
ought
to
be
serviceable
to
her
you
are
not
called
upon
to
divide
people
that
division
requires
so
much
experience
that
you
are
bound
in
this
matter
to
rely
upon
those
to
whom
your
obedience
is
due
i
can
not
but
think
you
must
have
known
that
you
were
not
entitled
to
give
your
love
to
any
man
without
being
assured
that
the
man
would
be
approved
of
by
by
by
me
he
was
going
to
say
your
parents
but
was
stopped
by
the
remembrance
of
his
wife
imprudence
she
saw
it
all
and
was
too
noble
to
plead
her
mother
authority
but
she
was
not
too
dutiful
to
cast
a
reproach
upon
him
when
he
was
so
stern
to
her
you
have
been
so
little
with
me
papa
that
is
true
he
said
after
a
pause
that
is
true
it
has
been
a
fault
and
i
will
mend
it
it
is
a
reason
for
forgiveness
and
i
will
forgive
you
but
you
must
tell
me
that
there
shall
be
an
end
to
this
no
papa
what
do
you
mean
that
as
i
love
tregear
and
as
i
have
told
him
so
and
as
i
have
promised
him
i
will
be
true
to
him
i
can
not
let
there
be
an
end
to
it
you
do
not
suppose
that
you
will
be
allowed
to
see
him
again
i
hope
so
most
assuredly
not
do
you
write
to
him
no
papa
never
never
since
we
have
been
back
in
england
you
must
promise
me
that
you
will
not
write
she
paused
a
moment
before
she
answered
him
and
now
she
was
looking
him
full
in
the
face
i
shall
not
write
to
him
i
do
not
think
i
shall
write
to
him
but
i
will
not
promise
not
promise
me
your
father
no
papa
it
might
be
that
that
i
should
do
it
you
would
not
wish
me
so
to
guard
you
that
you
should
have
no
power
of
sending
a
letter
but
by
permission
i
should
not
like
that
but
it
will
have
to
be
so
if
i
do
write
i
will
tell
you
and
show
me
what
you
write
no
papa
not
that
but
i
will
tell
you
what
i
have
written
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
this
bargaining
was
altogether
derogatory
to
his
parental
authority
and
by
no
means
likely
to
impress
upon
her
mind
the
conviction
that
tregear
must
be
completely
banished
from
her
thoughts
he
began
already
to
find
how
difficult
it
would
be
for
him
to
have
the
charge
of
such
a
daughter
how
impossible
that
he
should
conduct
such
a
charge
with
sufficient
firmness
and
yet
with
sufficient
tenderness
at
present
he
had
done
no
good
he
had
only
been
made
more
wretched
than
ever
by
her
obstinacy
surely
he
must
pass
her
over
to
the
charge
of
some
lady
but
of
some
lady
who
would
be
as
determined
as
was
he
himself
that
she
should
not
throw
herself
away
by
marrying
tregear
there
shall
be
no
writing
he
said
no
visiting
no
communication
of
any
kind
as
you
refuse
to
obey
me
now
you
had
better
go
to
your
room
chapter
ix
in
medias
res
perhaps
the
method
of
rushing
at
once
in
medias
res
is
of
all
the
ways
of
beginning
a
story
or
a
separate
branch
of
a
story
the
least
objectionable
the
reader
is
made
to
think
that
the
gold
lies
so
near
the
surface
that
he
will
be
required
to
take
very
little
trouble
in
digging
for
it
and
the
writer
is
enabled
at
any
rate
for
a
time
and
till
his
neck
has
become
as
it
were
warm
to
the
collar
to
throw
off
from
him
the
difficulties
and
dangers
the
tedium
and
prolixity
of
description
this
rushing
in
medias
res
has
doubtless
the
charm
of
ease
certainly
when
i
threw
her
from
the
garret
window
to
the
stony
pavement
below
i
did
not
anticipate
that
she
would
fall
so
far
without
injury
to
life
or
limb
when
a
story
has
been
begun
after
this
fashion
without
any
prelude
without
description
of
the
garret
or
of
the
pavement
or
of
the
lady
thrown
or
of
the
speaker
a
great
amount
of
trouble
seems
to
have
been
saved
the
mind
of
the
reader
fills
up
the
blanks
if
erroneously
still
satisfactorily
he
knows
at
least
that
the
heroine
has
encountered
a
terrible
danger
and
has
escaped
from
it
with
almost
incredible
good
fortune
that
the
demon
of
the
piece
is
a
bold
demon
not
ashamed
to
speak
of
his
own
iniquity
and
that
the
heroine
and
the
demon
are
so
far
united
that
they
have
been
in
a
garret
together
but
there
is
the
drawback
on
the
system
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
avoid
the
necessity
of
doing
sooner
or
later
that
which
would
naturally
be
done
at
first
it
answers
perhaps
for
chapters
and
to
carry
the
reader
pleasantly
for
chapters
is
a
great
matter
but
after
that
a
certain
nebulous
darkness
gradually
seems
to
envelope
the
characters
and
the
incidents
is
all
this
going
on
in
the
country
or
is
it
in
town
or
perhaps
in
the
colonies
how
old
was
she
was
she
tall
is
she
fair
is
she
in
her
form
and
gait
and
after
all
how
high
was
the
garret
window
i
have
always
found
that
the
details
would
insist
on
being
told
at
last
and
that
by
rushing
in
medias
res
i
was
simply
presenting
the
cart
before
the
horse
but
as
readers
like
the
cart
the
best
i
will
do
it
once
again
trying
it
only
for
a
branch
of
my
story
and
will
endeavour
to
let
as
little
as
possible
of
the
horse
be
seen
afterwards
and
so
poor
frank
has
been
turned
out
of
heaven
said
lady
mabel
grex
to
young
lord
silverbridge
who
told
you
that
i
have
said
nothing
about
it
to
anybody
of
course
he
told
me
himself
said
the
young
beauty
i
am
aware
that
in
the
word
beauty
and
perhaps
also
in
the
word
young
a
little
bit
of
the
horse
is
appearing
and
i
am
already
sure
that
i
shall
have
to
show
his
head
and
neck
even
if
not
his
very
tail
poor
frank
did
you
hear
it
all
i
heard
nothing
lady
mab
and
know
nothing
you
know
that
your
awful
governor
wo
let
him
stay
any
longer
in
carlton
terrace
yes
i
know
that
and
why
not
would
lord
grex
allow
percival
to
have
his
friends
living
here
earl
grex
was
lady
mabel
father
lord
percival
was
the
son
and
the
earl
lived
in
belgrave
square
all
these
are
little
bits
of
the
horse
certainly
not
in
the
first
place
i
am
here
that
makes
a
difference
certainly
of
course
it
makes
a
difference
they
would
be
wanting
to
make
love
to
me
no
doubt
i
should
i
know
and
therefore
it
would
do
for
you
to
live
here
and
then
papa
is
living
here
himself
and
then
the
permission
never
has
been
given
i
suppose
frank
did
not
go
there
at
first
without
the
duke
knowing
it
i
daresay
that
i
had
mentioned
it
you
might
as
well
tell
me
all
about
it
we
are
cousins
you
know
frank
tregear
through
his
mother
family
was
second
cousin
to
lady
mabel
as
was
also
lord
silverbridge
one
of
the
grexes
having
at
some
remote
period
married
a
palliser
this
is
another
bit
of
the
horse
the
governor
merely
seemed
to
think
that
he
would
like
to
have
his
own
house
to
himself
like
other
people
what
an
ass
tregear
was
to
say
anything
to
you
about
it
i
do
think
he
was
an
ass
at
all
of
course
he
had
to
tell
us
that
he
was
changing
his
residence
he
says
that
he
is
going
to
take
a
back
bedroom
somewhere
near
the
seven
dials
he
has
got
very
nice
rooms
in
duke
street
have
you
seen
him
then
of
course
i
have
poor
fellow
i
wish
he
had
a
little
money
he
is
so
nice
and
now
lord
silverbridge
do
you
mean
to
say
that
there
is
not
something
in
the
wind
about
lady
mary
if
there
were
i
should
not
talk
about
it
said
lord
silverbridge
you
are
a
very
innocent
young
gentleman
and
you
are
a
very
interesting
young
lady
you
ought
to
think
me
so
for
i
interest
myself
very
much
about
you
was
the
duke
very
angry
about
your
not
standing
for
the
county
he
was
vexed
i
do
think
it
is
so
odd
that
a
man
should
be
expected
to
be
this
or
that
in
politics
because
his
father
happened
to
be
so
before
him
i
do
understand
how
he
should
expect
that
you
should
remain
with
a
party
so
utterly
snobbish
and
down
in
the
world
as
the
radicals
everybody
that
is
worth
anything
is
leaving
them
he
has
not
left
them
no
i
do
suppose
he
could
but
you
have
i
never
belonged
to
them
lady
mab
and
never
will
i
hope
i
always
told
papa
that
you
would
certainly
be
one
of
us
all
this
took
place
in
the
of
lord
house
there
was
no
lady
grex
alive
but
there
lived
with
the
earl
a
certain
elderly
lady
reported
to
be
in
some
distant
way
a
cousin
of
the
family
named
miss
cassewary
who
in
the
matter
of
looking
after
lady
mab
did
what
was
supposed
to
be
absolutely
necessary
she
now
entered
the
room
with
her
bonnet
on
having
just
returned
from
church
what
was
the
text
asked
lady
mab
at
once
if
you
had
gone
to
church
as
you
ought
to
have
done
my
dear
you
would
have
heard
it
but
as
i
did
i
do
think
the
text
alone
will
do
you
any
good
and
probably
you
forget
it
no
i
do
my
dear
how
do
you
do
lord
silverbridge
he
is
a
conservative
miss
cass
of
course
he
is
i
am
quite
sure
that
a
young
nobleman
of
so
much
taste
and
intellect
would
take
the
better
side
you
forget
that
all
you
are
saying
is
against
my
father
and
my
family
miss
cassewary
i
dare
say
it
was
different
when
your
father
was
a
young
man
and
your
father
too
was
not
very
long
since
at
the
head
of
a
government
which
contained
many
conservatives
i
do
look
upon
your
father
as
a
radical
though
perhaps
i
should
not
be
justified
in
calling
him
a
conservative
well
certainly
not
i
think
but
now
it
is
necessary
that
all
noblemen
in
england
should
rally
to
the
defence
of
their
order
miss
cassewary
was
a
great
politician
and
was
one
of
those
who
are
always
foreseeing
the
ruin
of
their
country
my
dear
i
will
go
and
take
my
bonnet
off
perhaps
you
will
have
tea
when
i
come
down
do
you
go
said
lady
mabel
when
silverbridge
got
up
to
take
his
departure
i
always
do
when
tea
comes
but
you
are
going
to
dine
here
not
that
i
know
of
in
the
first
place
nobody
has
asked
me
in
the
second
place
i
am
engaged
thirdly
i
do
care
about
having
to
talk
politics
to
miss
cass
and
fourthly
i
hate
family
dinners
on
sunday
in
the
first
place
i
ask
you
secondly
i
know
you
were
going
to
dine
with
frank
tregear
at
the
club
thirdly
i
want
you
to
talk
to
me
and
not
to
miss
cass
and
fourthly
you
are
an
uncivil
young
young
young
i
should
say
cub
if
i
dared
to
tell
me
that
you
do
like
dining
with
me
any
day
of
the
week
of
course
you
know
what
i
mean
is
that
i
do
like
troubling
your
father
leave
that
to
me
i
shall
tell
him
you
are
coming
and
frank
too
of
course
you
can
bring
him
then
he
can
talk
to
me
when
papa
goes
down
to
his
club
and
you
can
arrange
your
politics
with
miss
cass
so
it
was
settled
and
at
eight
lord
silverbridge
reappeared
in
belgrave
square
with
frank
tregear
earl
grex
was
a
nobleman
of
very
ancient
family
the
grexes
having
held
the
parish
of
grex
in
yorkshire
from
some
time
long
prior
to
the
conquest
in
saying
all
this
i
am
i
know
allowing
the
horse
to
appear
wholesale
but
i
find
that
he
can
not
be
kept
out
i
may
as
well
go
on
to
say
that
the
present
earl
was
better
known
at
newmarket
and
the
beaufort
where
he
spent
a
large
part
of
his
life
in
playing
whist
than
in
the
house
of
lords
he
was
a
handsome
old
man
who
through
a
long
life
of
pleasure
had
greatly
impaired
a
fortune
which
for
an
earl
had
never
been
magnificent
and
who
now
strove
hard
but
not
always
successfully
to
remedy
that
evil
by
gambling
as
he
could
no
longer
eat
and
drink
as
he
had
used
to
do
and
as
he
cared
no
longer
for
the
light
that
lies
in
a
eye
there
was
not
much
left
to
him
in
the
world
but
cards
and
racing
nevertheless
he
was
a
handsome
old
man
of
polished
manners
when
he
chose
to
use
them
a
staunch
conservative
and
much
regarded
by
his
party
for
whom
in
his
early
life
he
had
done
some
work
in
the
house
of
commons
silverbridge
is
all
very
well
he
had
said
but
i
do
see
why
that
young
tregear
is
to
dine
here
every
night
of
his
life
this
is
the
second
time
since
he
has
been
up
in
town
papa
he
was
here
last
week
i
know
silverbridge
would
come
without
him
that
d
nonsense
said
the
earl
miss
cassewary
gave
a
start
not
we
may
presume
because
she
was
shocked
for
she
could
not
be
much
shocked
having
heard
the
same
word
from
the
same
lips
very
often
but
she
thought
it
right
always
to
enter
a
protest
then
the
two
young
men
were
announced
frank
tregear
having
been
known
by
the
family
as
a
boy
was
frank
to
all
of
them
as
was
lady
mabel
mabel
to
him
somewhat
to
the
disgust
of
the
father
and
not
altogether
with
the
approbation
of
miss
cass
but
lady
mabel
had
declared
that
she
would
not
be
guilty
of
the
folly
of
changing
old
habits
silverbridge
being
silverbridge
to
all
his
own
people
hardly
seemed
to
have
a
christian
name
his
godfathers
and
godmothers
had
indeed
called
him
plantagenet
but
having
only
become
acquainted
with
the
family
since
his
oxford
days
he
was
lord
silverbridge
to
lady
mabel
lady
mabel
had
not
as
yet
become
mabel
to
him
but
as
by
her
very
intimate
friends
she
was
called
mab
had
allowed
herself
to
be
addressed
by
him
as
lady
mab
there
was
thus
between
them
all
considerable
intimacy
i
deuced
glad
to
hear
it
said
the
earl
when
dinner
was
announced
for
though
he
could
not
eat
much
lord
grex
was
always
impatient
when
the
time
of
eating
was
at
hand
then
he
walked
down
alone
lord
silverbridge
followed
with
his
daughter
and
frank
tregear
gave
his
arm
to
miss
cassewary
if
that
woman
ca
clear
her
soup
better
than
that
she
might
as
well
go
to
the
d
said
the
earl
upon
which
remark
no
one
in
the
company
made
any
observation
as
there
were
two
in
the
room
when
it
was
made
the
cook
probably
had
the
advantage
of
it
it
may
be
almost
unnecessary
to
add
that
though
the
earl
had
polished
manners
for
certain
occasions
he
would
sometimes
throw
them
off
in
the
bosom
of
his
own
family
my
lord
said
miss
cassewary
she
always
called
him
my
lord
lord
silverbridge
is
going
to
stand
for
the
duke
borough
in
the
conservative
interest
i
did
know
the
duke
had
a
borough
said
the
earl
he
had
one
till
he
thought
it
proper
to
give
it
up
said
the
son
taking
his
father
part
and
you
are
going
to
pay
him
off
for
what
he
has
done
by
standing
against
him
it
just
the
sort
of
thing
for
a
son
to
do
in
these
days
if
i
had
a
borough
percival
would
go
down
and
make
radical
speeches
there
there
is
a
better
conservative
in
england
than
percival
said
lady
mabel
bridling
up
nor
a
worse
son
said
the
father
i
believe
he
would
do
anything
he
could
lay
his
hand
on
to
oppose
me
during
the
past
week
there
had
been
some
little
difference
of
opinion
between
the
father
and
the
son
as
to
the
signing
of
a
deed
my
father
does
not
take
it
in
bad
part
at
all
said
silverbridge
perhaps
he
ratting
himself
said
the
earl
when
a
man
lends
himself
to
a
coalition
he
is
as
good
as
half
gone
i
do
not
think
that
in
all
england
there
is
so
thorough
a
liberal
as
my
father
said
lord
silverbridge
and
when
i
say
that
he
take
this
badly
i
do
mean
that
it
does
vex
him
i
know
it
vexes
him
but
he
does
quarrel
with
me
he
even
wrote
down
to
barsetshire
to
say
that
all
my
expenses
at
silverbridge
were
to
be
paid
i
call
that
very
bad
politics
said
the
earl
it
seems
to
me
to
be
very
grand
said
frank
perhaps
sir
you
do
know
what
is
good
or
what
is
bad
in
politics
said
the
earl
trying
to
snub
his
guest
but
it
was
difficult
to
snub
frank
i
know
a
gentleman
when
i
see
him
i
think
he
said
of
course
silverbridge
is
right
to
be
a
conservative
nobody
has
a
stronger
opinion
about
that
than
i
have
but
the
duke
is
behaving
so
well
that
if
i
were
he
i
should
almost
regret
it
and
so
i
do
said
silverbridge
when
the
ladies
were
gone
the
old
earl
turned
himself
round
to
the
fire
having
filled
his
glass
and
pushed
the
bottles
away
from
him
as
though
he
meant
to
leave
the
two
young
men
to
themselves
he
sat
leaning
with
his
head
on
his
hand
looking
the
picture
of
woe
it
was
now
only
nine
and
there
would
be
no
whist
at
the
beaufort
till
eleven
there
was
still
more
than
an
hour
to
be
endured
before
the
brougham
would
come
to
fetch
him
i
suppose
we
shall
have
a
majority
said
frank
trying
to
rouse
him
who
does
mean
asked
the
earl
the
conservatives
of
whom
i
take
the
liberty
to
call
myself
one
it
sounded
as
though
you
were
a
very
influential
member
of
the
party
i
consider
myself
to
be
one
of
the
party
and
so
i
say
upstairs
in
the
miss
cassewary
did
her
duty
loyally
it
was
quite
right
that
young
ladies
and
young
gentlemen
should
be
allowed
to
talk
together
and
very
right
indeed
that
such
a
young
gentleman
as
lord
silverbridge
should
be
allowed
to
talk
to
such
a
young
lady
as
lady
mabel
what
could
be
so
nice
as
a
marriage
between
the
heir
of
the
house
of
omnium
and
lady
mabel
grex
lady
mabel
looked
indeed
to
be
the
elder
but
they
were
in
truth
the
same
age
all
the
world
acknowledged
that
lady
mabel
was
very
clever
and
very
beautiful
and
fit
to
be
a
duchess
even
the
earl
when
miss
cassewary
hinted
at
the
matter
to
him
grunted
an
assent
lady
mabel
had
already
refused
one
or
two
not
ineligible
offers
and
it
was
necessary
that
something
should
be
done
there
had
been
at
one
time
a
fear
in
miss
cassewary
bosom
lest
her
charge
should
fall
too
deeply
in
love
with
frank
tregear
but
miss
cassewary
knew
that
whatever
danger
there
might
have
been
in
that
respect
had
passed
away
frank
was
willing
to
talk
to
her
while
mabel
and
lord
silverbridge
were
in
a
corner
together
i
shall
be
on
tenterhooks
now
till
i
know
how
it
is
to
be
at
silverbridge
said
the
young
lady
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
feel
so
much
interest
of
course
i
feel
an
interest
are
not
you
one
of
us
when
is
it
to
be
they
say
that
the
elections
will
be
over
before
the
derby
and
which
do
you
care
for
the
most
i
should
like
to
pull
off
the
derby
i
own
from
what
papa
says
i
should
think
the
other
event
is
the
more
probable
does
the
earl
stand
to
win
on
prime
minister
i
never
know
anything
about
his
betting
but
you
know
his
way
he
said
you
were
going
to
drop
a
lot
of
money
like
a
i
ca
quite
tell
you
what
he
likened
you
to
the
earl
may
be
mistaken
you
are
not
betting
much
i
hope
not
plunging
but
i
have
a
little
money
on
do
get
into
a
way
of
betting
why
what
difference
does
it
make
to
you
is
that
kind
lord
silverbridge
i
meant
to
say
that
if
i
did
make
a
mess
of
it
you
would
care
about
it
yes
i
should
i
should
care
very
much
i
dare
say
you
could
lose
a
great
deal
of
money
and
care
nothing
about
it
indeed
i
could
not
what
would
be
a
great
deal
of
money
to
me
but
you
would
want
to
get
it
back
again
and
in
that
way
you
would
be
regularly
on
the
turf
and
why
not
i
want
to
see
better
things
from
you
you
ought
not
to
preach
against
the
turf
lady
mab
because
of
papa
but
i
am
not
preaching
against
the
turf
if
i
were
such
as
you
are
i
would
have
a
horse
or
two
myself
a
man
in
your
position
should
do
a
little
of
everything
you
should
hunt
and
have
a
yacht
and
stalk
deer
and
keep
your
own
trainer
at
newmarket
i
wish
you
say
all
that
to
my
father
of
course
i
mean
if
you
can
afford
it
i
like
a
man
to
like
pleasure
but
i
despise
a
man
who
makes
a
business
of
his
pleasures
when
i
hear
that
this
man
is
the
best
in
london
and
that
man
the
best
i
always
know
that
they
can
do
nothing
else
and
then
i
despise
them
you
need
despise
me
because
i
do
nothing
well
said
he
as
he
got
up
to
take
his
leave
i
do
so
hope
you
get
the
seat
and
win
the
derby
these
were
her
last
words
to
him
as
she
wished
him
chapter
x
why
not
like
romeo
if
i
feel
like
romeo
that
nonsense
miss
cass
and
i
shall
said
lady
mabel
they
were
together
on
the
morning
after
the
little
described
in
the
last
chapter
in
a
small
back
which
was
supposed
to
be
lady
mabel
own
and
the
servant
had
just
announced
the
fact
that
tregear
was
below
then
i
shall
go
down
too
said
miss
cassewary
you
do
nothing
of
the
kind
will
you
please
to
tell
me
what
it
is
you
are
afraid
of
do
you
think
that
frank
is
going
to
make
love
to
me
again
no
or
that
if
i
chose
that
he
should
i
would
let
you
stop
me
he
is
in
love
with
somebody
else
and
perhaps
i
am
too
and
we
are
two
paupers
my
lord
would
not
approve
of
it
if
you
know
what
my
lord
approves
of
and
what
he
disapproves
you
understand
him
a
great
deal
better
than
i
do
and
if
you
mind
what
he
approves
or
disapproves
you
care
for
his
opinion
a
great
deal
more
than
i
do
my
cousin
is
here
now
to
talk
to
me
about
his
own
affairs
and
i
mean
to
see
him
alone
then
she
left
the
little
room
and
went
down
to
that
in
which
frank
was
waiting
for
her
without
the
company
of
miss
cassewary
do
you
really
mean
she
said
after
they
had
been
together
for
some
minutes
that
you
had
the
courage
to
ask
the
duke
for
his
hand
why
not
i
believe
you
would
dare
do
anything
i
could
very
well
take
it
without
asking
him
as
i
am
not
acquainted
with
the
young
lady
i
do
know
how
that
might
be
and
if
i
took
her
so
i
should
have
to
take
her
which
would
suit
would
it
it
would
suit
for
her
whose
comforts
and
happiness
are
much
more
to
me
than
my
own
no
doubt
of
course
you
are
terribly
in
love
very
thoroughly
in
love
i
think
i
am
for
the
tenth
time
i
should
say
for
the
second
only
i
do
regard
myself
as
a
monument
of
constancy
but
i
think
i
am
less
fickle
than
some
other
people
meaning
me
not
especially
frank
that
is
and
almost
unmanly
and
false
also
when
have
i
been
fickle
you
say
that
there
was
one
before
with
you
i
say
that
there
has
never
really
been
one
with
me
at
all
no
one
knows
that
better
than
yourself
i
can
not
afford
to
be
in
love
till
i
am
quite
sure
that
the
man
is
fit
to
be
and
will
be
my
husband
i
doubt
sometimes
whether
you
are
capable
of
being
in
love
with
any
one
i
think
i
am
she
said
very
gently
but
i
am
at
any
rate
capable
of
not
being
in
love
till
i
wish
it
come
frank
do
not
quarrel
with
me
you
know
you
ought
to
know
that
i
should
have
loved
you
had
it
not
been
that
such
love
would
have
been
bad
for
both
of
us
it
is
a
kind
of
i
do
not
understand
because
you
are
not
a
woman
why
did
you
twit
me
with
changing
my
love
because
i
am
a
woman
ca
you
forgive
as
much
as
that
to
me
certainly
only
you
must
not
think
that
i
have
been
false
because
i
now
love
her
so
dearly
i
do
not
think
you
are
false
i
would
do
anything
to
help
you
if
there
were
anything
i
could
do
but
when
you
spoke
so
like
a
romeo
of
your
love
why
not
like
a
romeo
if
i
feel
like
a
romeo
but
i
doubt
whether
romeo
talked
much
to
rosaline
of
his
love
for
juliet
but
you
shall
talk
to
me
of
yours
for
lady
mary
and
i
will
listen
to
you
patiently
and
encourage
you
and
will
not
even
think
of
those
former
vows
the
former
vows
were
foolish
oh
of
course
you
at
least
used
to
say
so
i
say
so
now
and
they
shall
be
as
though
they
had
been
never
spoken
so
you
bearded
the
duke
in
his
den
and
asked
him
for
lady
mary
hand
just
as
though
you
had
been
a
young
duke
yourself
and
owned
half
a
county
just
the
same
and
what
did
he
say
he
swore
that
it
was
of
course
i
knew
all
that
before
how
will
it
be
now
you
will
not
give
it
up
certainly
not
and
lady
mary
one
human
being
can
perhaps
never
answer
for
another
with
perfect
security
but
you
feel
sure
of
her
i
do
he
i
should
think
can
be
very
imperious
and
so
can
she
the
pallisers
are
all
obstinate
is
silverbridge
obstinate
she
asked
as
a
bull
if
he
takes
it
into
his
head
to
be
so
i
should
have
thought
it
no
because
he
is
so
soft
in
his
manner
and
often
finds
it
easier
to
be
led
by
others
than
to
direct
himself
then
she
remained
silent
for
a
few
seconds
they
were
both
thinking
of
the
same
thing
and
both
wishing
to
speak
of
it
but
the
words
came
to
her
first
i
wonder
what
he
thinks
of
me
whereupon
tregear
only
smiled
i
suppose
he
has
spoken
to
you
about
me
why
do
you
ask
why
and
why
should
i
tell
you
suppose
he
should
have
said
to
me
in
the
confidence
of
friendship
that
he
thinks
you
ugly
and
stupid
i
am
sure
he
has
not
said
that
he
has
eyes
to
see
and
ears
to
hear
but
though
i
am
neither
ugly
nor
stupid
he
need
like
me
do
you
want
him
to
like
you
yes
i
do
oh
yes
you
may
laugh
but
if
i
did
not
think
that
i
could
be
a
good
wife
to
him
i
would
not
take
his
hand
even
to
become
duchess
of
omnium
do
you
mean
that
you
love
him
mabel
no
i
do
not
mean
that
but
i
would
learn
to
love
him
you
do
not
believe
that
here
he
smiled
again
and
shook
his
head
it
is
as
i
said
before
because
you
are
not
a
woman
and
do
not
understand
how
women
are
trammelled
do
you
think
ill
of
me
because
i
say
this
no
indeed
do
not
think
ill
of
me
if
you
can
help
it
because
you
are
almost
the
only
friend
that
i
can
trust
i
almost
trust
dear
old
cass
but
not
quite
she
is
and
i
shock
her
as
for
other
women
there
is
one
anywhere
to
whom
i
would
say
a
word
only
think
how
a
girl
such
as
i
am
is
placed
or
indeed
any
girl
you
if
you
see
a
woman
that
you
fancy
can
pursue
her
can
win
her
and
triumph
or
lose
her
and
gnaw
your
heart
at
any
rate
you
can
do
something
you
can
tell
her
that
you
love
her
can
tell
her
so
again
and
again
even
though
she
should
scorn
you
you
can
set
yourself
about
the
business
you
have
taken
in
hand
and
can
work
hard
at
it
what
can
a
girl
do
girls
work
hard
too
sometimes
of
course
they
do
but
everybody
feels
that
they
are
sinning
against
their
sex
of
love
such
as
a
man
is
a
woman
ought
to
know
nothing
how
can
she
love
with
passion
when
she
should
never
give
her
love
till
it
has
been
asked
and
not
then
unless
her
friends
tell
her
that
the
thing
is
suitable
love
such
as
that
to
me
is
out
of
the
question
but
as
it
is
fit
that
i
should
be
married
i
wish
to
be
married
well
and
you
will
love
him
after
a
fashion
yes
after
a
very
sterling
fashion
i
will
make
his
wishes
my
wishes
his
ways
my
ways
his
party
my
party
his
home
my
home
his
ambition
my
ambition
his
honour
my
honour
as
she
said
this
she
stood
up
with
her
hands
clenched
and
head
erect
and
her
eyes
flashing
do
you
not
know
me
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
i
should
be
loyal
to
him
yes
i
think
that
you
would
be
loyal
whether
i
loved
him
or
not
he
should
love
me
and
you
think
that
silverbridge
would
do
yes
i
think
that
silverbridge
would
do
you
no
doubt
will
say
that
i
am
flying
high
not
too
high
why
should
you
not
fly
high
if
i
can
justify
myself
surely
i
can
not
accuse
you
it
is
hardly
the
same
thing
frank
of
course
there
is
not
a
girl
in
london
to
whom
lord
silverbridge
would
not
be
the
best
match
that
she
could
make
he
has
the
choice
of
us
all
most
girls
would
think
twice
before
refusing
him
very
few
would
think
twice
before
accepting
him
perhaps
he
wishes
to
add
to
his
wealth
by
marrying
richly
as
his
father
did
no
thought
on
that
subject
will
ever
trouble
him
that
will
be
all
as
it
happens
as
soon
as
he
takes
a
sufficient
fancy
to
a
girl
he
will
ask
her
straight
off
i
do
not
say
that
he
might
not
change
afterwards
but
he
would
mean
it
at
the
time
if
he
had
once
said
the
word
to
me
he
should
not
change
but
then
what
right
have
i
to
expect
it
what
has
he
ever
said
about
me
very
little
but
had
he
said
much
i
should
not
tell
you
you
are
my
friend
but
you
are
his
too
and
he
perhaps
is
more
to
you
than
i
am
as
his
friend
it
may
be
your
duty
to
tell
him
all
that
i
am
saying
if
so
i
have
been
wrong
do
you
think
that
i
shall
do
that
mabel
i
do
not
know
men
are
so
strong
in
their
friendships
mine
with
you
is
the
older
and
the
sweeter
though
we
may
not
be
more
than
friends
i
will
say
that
it
is
the
more
tender
in
my
heart
of
hearts
i
do
not
think
that
silverbridge
could
do
better
thanks
for
that
frank
i
shall
tell
him
nothing
of
you
that
can
set
him
against
you
and
you
would
be
glad
to
see
me
his
wife
she
said
as
you
must
be
somebody
wife
and
not
mine
i
can
not
be
yours
frank
can
i
and
not
mine
he
repeated
i
will
endeavour
to
be
glad
who
can
explain
his
feelings
in
such
a
matter
though
i
most
truly
love
the
girl
i
hope
to
marry
yet
my
heart
goes
back
to
former
things
and
opens
itself
to
past
regrets
i
know
it
all
she
whispered
but
you
and
i
must
be
too
wise
to
permit
ourselves
to
be
tormented
by
such
foolish
melancholy
as
he
said
this
he
took
her
hand
half
with
the
purpose
of
bidding
her
but
partly
with
the
idea
of
giving
some
expression
to
the
tenderness
of
his
feelings
but
as
he
did
so
the
door
was
opened
and
the
old
earl
shambled
into
the
room
what
the
deuce
are
you
doing
here
he
said
i
have
been
talking
to
lady
mabel
for
about
an
hour
indeed
i
do
not
know
for
how
long
papa
he
is
going
to
be
married
when
she
said
this
frank
tregear
turned
round
and
looked
at
her
almost
in
anger
going
to
be
married
is
he
who
is
the
fortunate
woman
i
do
think
he
will
let
me
tell
you
not
yet
i
think
said
frank
gloomily
there
is
nothing
settled
the
old
earl
looked
puzzled
but
lady
mabel
craft
had
been
successful
if
this
objectionable
young
had
come
there
to
talk
about
his
marriage
with
another
young
woman
the
conversation
must
have
been
innocent
where
is
miss
cassewary
asked
the
earl
i
asked
her
not
to
come
down
with
me
because
frank
wished
to
speak
to
me
about
his
own
affairs
you
have
no
objection
to
his
coming
papa
there
had
been
objections
raised
to
any
intimacy
with
frank
tregear
but
all
that
was
now
nearly
two
years
since
he
had
been
assured
over
and
over
again
by
miss
cassewary
that
he
need
not
be
afraid
of
frank
tregear
and
had
in
a
sort
of
way
assented
to
the
young
man
visits
i
think
he
might
find
something
better
to
do
with
his
time
than
hanging
about
here
all
day
frank
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
having
shaken
hands
both
with
the
daughter
and
father
took
his
hat
and
departed
who
is
the
girl
asked
the
earl
you
heard
him
say
that
i
was
not
to
tell
has
she
got
money
i
believe
she
will
have
a
great
deal
then
she
is
a
great
fool
for
her
pains
said
the
earl
shambling
off
again
lady
mabel
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
afternoon
alone
endeavouring
to
recall
to
her
mind
all
that
she
had
said
to
frank
tregear
and
questioning
herself
as
to
the
wisdom
and
truth
of
her
own
words
she
had
intended
to
tell
the
truth
but
hardly
perhaps
the
whole
truth
the
life
which
was
before
her
which
it
was
necessary
that
she
should
lead
seemed
to
her
to
be
so
difficult
she
could
not
clearly
see
her
way
to
be
pure
and
good
and
feminine
and
at
the
same
time
wise
she
had
been
false
now
so
far
false
that
she
had
told
her
friend
that
she
had
never
been
in
love
but
she
was
in
love
in
love
with
him
frank
tregear
she
knew
it
as
thoroughly
as
it
was
possible
for
her
to
know
anything
and
had
acknowledged
it
to
herself
a
score
of
times
but
she
could
not
marry
him
and
it
was
expected
nay
almost
necessary
that
she
should
marry
someone
to
that
someone
how
good
she
would
be
how
she
would
strive
by
duty
and
attention
and
if
possible
by
affection
to
make
up
for
that
misfortune
of
her
early
love
and
so
i
hope
that
i
have
brought
my
cart
in
to
its
appointed
place
in
the
front
without
showing
too
much
of
the
horse
chapter
xi
cruel
for
two
or
three
days
after
the
first
scene
between
the
duke
and
his
daughter
that
scene
in
which
she
was
forbidden
either
to
see
or
to
write
to
her
lover
not
a
word
was
said
at
matching
about
tregear
nor
were
any
steps
taken
towards
curtailing
her
liberty
of
action
she
had
said
she
would
not
write
to
him
without
telling
her
father
and
the
duke
was
too
proud
of
the
honour
of
his
family
to
believe
it
to
be
possible
that
she
should
deceive
him
nor
was
it
possible
not
only
would
her
own
idea
of
duty
prevent
her
from
writing
to
her
lover
although
she
had
stipulated
for
the
right
to
do
so
in
some
possible
emergency
but
carried
far
beyond
that
in
her
sense
of
what
was
right
and
wrong
she
felt
it
now
incumbent
on
her
to
have
no
secret
from
her
father
at
all
the
secret
as
long
as
it
had
been
a
secret
had
been
a
legacy
from
her
mother
and
had
been
kept
at
her
lover
instance
during
that
period
of
mourning
for
her
mother
in
which
it
would
she
thought
have
been
indecorous
that
there
should
be
any
question
of
love
or
of
giving
in
marriage
it
had
been
a
burden
to
her
though
a
necessary
burden
she
had
been
very
clear
that
the
revelation
should
be
made
to
her
father
when
it
was
made
by
her
lover
that
had
been
done
and
now
it
was
open
to
her
to
live
without
any
secrecy
as
was
her
nature
she
meant
to
cling
to
her
lover
she
was
quite
sure
of
that
nothing
could
divide
her
from
him
but
his
death
or
hers
or
falseness
on
his
part
but
as
to
marriage
that
would
not
be
possible
till
her
father
had
assented
and
as
to
seeing
the
man
ah
yes
if
she
could
do
so
with
her
father
assent
she
would
not
be
ashamed
to
own
her
great
desire
to
see
him
she
would
tell
her
father
that
all
her
happiness
depended
upon
seeing
him
she
would
not
be
coy
in
speaking
of
her
love
but
she
would
obey
her
father
she
had
a
strong
idea
that
she
would
ultimately
prevail
an
idea
also
that
that
ultimately
should
not
be
postponed
to
some
undefined
period
of
her
life
as
she
intended
to
belong
to
frank
tregear
she
thought
it
expedient
that
he
should
have
the
best
of
her
days
as
well
as
what
might
be
supposed
to
be
the
worst
and
she
therefore
resolved
that
it
would
be
her
duty
to
make
her
father
understand
that
though
she
would
certainly
obey
him
she
would
look
to
be
treated
humanely
by
him
and
not
to
be
made
miserable
for
an
indefinite
term
of
years
the
first
word
spoken
between
them
on
the
subject
the
first
word
after
that
discussion
began
with
him
and
was
caused
by
his
feeling
that
her
present
life
at
matching
must
be
sad
and
lonely
lady
cantrip
had
again
written
that
she
would
be
delighted
to
take
her
but
lady
cantrip
was
in
london
and
must
be
in
london
at
any
rate
when
parliament
should
again
be
sitting
a
london
life
would
perhaps
at
present
hardly
suit
lady
mary
then
a
plan
had
been
prepared
which
might
be
convenient
the
duke
had
a
house
at
richmond
on
the
river
called
the
horns
that
should
be
lent
to
lady
cantrip
and
mary
should
there
be
her
guest
so
it
was
settled
between
the
duke
and
lady
cantrip
but
as
yet
lady
mary
knew
nothing
of
the
arrangement
i
think
i
shall
go
up
to
town
said
the
duke
to
his
daughter
for
long
i
shall
be
gone
only
one
night
it
is
on
your
behalf
that
i
am
going
on
my
behalf
papa
i
have
been
writing
to
lady
cantrip
not
about
mr
tregear
no
not
about
tregear
said
the
father
with
a
mixture
of
anger
and
solemnity
in
his
tone
it
is
my
desire
to
regard
tregear
as
though
he
did
not
exist
that
is
not
possible
papa
i
have
alluded
to
the
inconvenience
of
your
position
here
why
is
it
inconvenient
you
are
too
young
to
be
without
a
companion
it
is
not
fit
that
you
should
be
so
much
alone
i
do
not
feel
it
it
is
very
melancholy
for
you
and
can
not
be
good
for
you
they
will
go
down
to
the
horns
so
that
you
will
not
be
absolutely
in
london
and
you
will
find
lady
cantrip
a
very
nice
person
i
do
care
for
new
people
just
now
papa
she
said
but
to
this
he
paid
but
little
heed
nor
was
she
prepared
to
say
that
she
would
not
do
as
he
directed
when
therefore
he
left
matching
she
understood
that
he
was
going
to
prepare
a
temporary
home
for
her
nothing
further
was
said
about
tregear
she
was
too
proud
to
ask
that
no
mention
of
his
name
should
be
made
to
lady
cantrip
and
he
when
he
left
the
house
did
not
think
that
he
would
find
himself
called
upon
to
allude
to
the
subject
but
when
lady
cantrip
made
some
inquiry
about
the
girl
and
her
habits
asking
what
were
her
ordinary
occupations
how
she
was
accustomed
to
pass
her
hours
to
what
she
chiefly
devoted
herself
then
at
last
with
much
difficulty
the
duke
did
bring
himself
to
tell
the
story
perhaps
it
is
better
you
should
know
it
all
he
said
as
he
told
it
poor
girl
yes
duke
upon
the
whole
it
is
better
that
i
should
know
it
all
said
lady
cantrip
of
course
he
will
not
come
here
oh
dear
i
hope
not
nor
to
the
horns
i
hope
he
will
never
see
her
again
anywhere
said
the
duke
poor
girl
have
i
not
been
right
is
it
not
best
to
put
an
end
to
such
a
thing
at
once
certainly
at
once
if
it
has
to
be
put
an
end
to
and
can
be
put
an
end
to
it
must
be
put
an
end
to
said
the
duke
very
decidedly
do
you
not
see
that
it
must
be
so
who
is
mr
tregear
i
suppose
they
were
allowed
to
be
together
he
was
unfortunately
intimate
with
silverbridge
who
took
him
over
to
italy
he
has
nothing
not
even
a
profession
lady
cantrip
could
not
but
smile
when
she
remembered
the
immense
wealth
of
the
man
who
was
speaking
to
her
and
the
duke
saw
the
smile
and
understood
it
you
will
understand
what
i
mean
lady
cantrip
if
this
young
man
were
in
other
respects
suitable
of
course
i
could
find
an
income
for
them
but
he
is
nothing
just
an
idle
seeker
for
pleasure
without
the
means
of
obtaining
it
that
is
very
bad
as
for
rank
continued
the
duke
energetically
i
do
not
think
that
i
am
specially
wedded
to
it
i
have
found
myself
as
willing
to
associate
with
those
who
are
without
it
as
with
those
who
have
it
but
for
my
child
i
would
wish
her
to
mate
with
one
of
her
own
class
it
would
be
best
when
a
young
man
comes
to
me
who
though
i
believe
him
to
be
what
is
called
a
gentleman
has
neither
rank
nor
means
nor
profession
nor
name
and
asks
for
my
daughter
surely
i
am
right
to
say
that
such
a
marriage
shall
not
be
thought
of
was
i
not
right
demanded
the
duke
persistently
but
it
is
a
pity
that
it
should
be
so
it
is
a
pity
that
they
should
ever
have
come
together
it
is
indeed
indeed
to
be
lamented
and
i
will
own
at
once
that
the
fault
was
not
hers
though
i
must
be
firm
in
this
you
are
not
to
suppose
that
i
am
angry
with
her
i
have
myself
been
to
blame
this
he
said
with
a
resolution
that
as
he
and
his
wife
had
been
one
flesh
all
faults
committed
by
her
should
now
that
she
was
dead
be
accepted
by
him
as
his
faults
it
had
not
occurred
to
me
that
as
yet
she
would
love
any
man
has
it
gone
deep
with
her
duke
i
fear
that
all
things
go
deep
with
her
poor
girl
but
they
shall
be
kept
apart
as
long
as
your
great
kindness
is
continued
to
her
they
shall
be
kept
apart
i
do
not
think
that
i
should
be
found
good
at
watching
a
young
lady
she
will
require
no
watching
then
of
course
they
will
not
meet
she
had
better
know
that
you
have
told
me
she
shall
know
it
and
let
her
know
also
that
anything
i
can
do
to
make
her
happy
shall
be
done
but
duke
there
is
but
one
cure
time
you
mean
yes
time
but
i
did
not
mean
time
then
she
smiled
as
she
went
on
you
must
not
suppose
that
i
am
speaking
against
my
own
sex
if
i
say
that
she
will
not
forget
tregear
till
someone
else
has
made
himself
agreeable
to
her
we
must
wait
till
she
can
go
out
a
little
into
society
then
she
will
find
out
that
there
are
others
in
the
world
besides
tregear
it
so
often
is
the
case
that
a
girl
love
means
her
sympathy
for
him
who
has
chanced
to
be
nearest
to
her
the
duke
as
he
went
away
thought
very
much
of
what
lady
cantrip
had
said
to
him
particularly
of
those
last
words
till
some
one
else
has
made
himself
agreeable
to
her
was
he
to
send
his
girl
into
the
world
in
order
that
she
might
find
a
lover
there
was
something
in
the
idea
which
was
thoroughly
distasteful
to
him
he
had
not
given
his
mind
much
to
the
matter
but
he
felt
that
a
woman
should
be
sought
for
sought
for
and
extracted
cunningly
as
it
were
from
some
and
not
sent
out
into
a
market
to
be
exposed
as
for
sale
in
his
own
personal
history
there
had
been
a
misfortune
a
misfortune
the
sense
of
which
he
could
never
at
any
moment
have
expressed
to
any
ears
the
memory
of
which
had
been
always
buried
in
his
own
bosom
but
a
misfortune
in
that
no
such
cunning
extraction
on
his
part
had
won
for
him
the
woman
to
whose
hands
had
been
confided
the
strings
of
his
heart
his
wife
had
undergone
that
process
of
extraction
before
he
had
seen
her
and
his
marriage
with
her
had
been
a
matter
of
sagacious
bargaining
he
was
now
told
that
his
daughter
must
be
sent
out
among
young
men
in
order
that
she
might
become
sufficiently
fond
of
some
special
one
to
be
regardless
of
tregear
there
was
a
feeling
that
in
doing
so
she
must
lose
something
of
the
freshness
of
the
bloom
of
her
innocence
how
was
this
transfer
of
her
love
to
be
effected
let
her
go
here
because
she
will
meet
the
heir
of
this
wealthy
house
who
may
probably
be
smitten
by
her
charms
or
there
because
that
other
young
lordling
would
make
a
fit
husband
for
her
let
us
contrive
to
throw
her
into
the
arms
of
this
man
or
put
her
into
the
way
of
that
man
was
his
girl
to
be
exposed
to
this
surely
that
method
of
bargaining
to
which
he
had
owed
his
own
wife
would
be
better
than
that
let
it
be
said
only
he
himself
most
certainly
could
not
be
the
person
to
say
it
let
it
be
said
to
some
man
of
rank
and
means
and
fairly
good
character
here
is
a
wife
for
you
with
so
many
thousand
pounds
with
beauty
as
you
can
see
for
yourself
with
rank
and
belongings
of
the
highest
very
good
in
every
respect
only
that
as
regards
her
heart
she
thinks
she
has
given
it
to
a
young
man
named
tregear
no
marriage
there
is
possible
but
perhaps
the
young
lady
might
suit
you
it
was
thus
he
had
been
married
there
was
an
absence
in
it
of
that
romance
which
though
he
had
never
experienced
it
in
his
own
life
was
always
present
to
his
imagination
his
wife
had
often
ridiculed
him
because
he
could
only
live
among
figures
and
official
details
but
to
her
had
not
been
given
the
power
of
looking
into
a
man
heart
and
feeling
all
that
was
there
yes
in
such
bargaining
for
a
wife
in
such
bargaining
for
a
husband
there
could
be
nothing
of
the
tremulous
delicacy
of
feminine
romance
but
it
would
be
better
than
standing
at
a
stall
in
the
market
till
the
sufficient
purchaser
should
come
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
the
delicacy
the
innocence
the
romance
the
bloom
might
all
be
preserved
if
he
would
give
his
girl
to
the
man
whom
she
said
she
loved
could
he
have
modelled
her
future
course
according
to
his
own
wishes
he
would
have
had
her
live
a
gentle
life
for
the
next
three
years
with
a
pencil
perhaps
in
her
hand
or
a
before
her
and
then
come
forth
cleaned
as
it
were
by
such
quarantine
from
the
impurity
to
which
she
had
been
subjected
when
he
was
back
at
matching
he
at
once
told
his
daughter
what
he
had
arranged
for
her
and
then
there
took
place
a
prolonged
discussion
both
as
to
his
view
of
her
future
life
and
as
to
her
own
you
did
tell
her
then
about
mr
tregear
she
asked
as
she
is
to
have
charge
of
you
for
a
time
i
thought
it
best
perhaps
it
is
perhaps
you
were
afraid
no
i
was
not
afraid
he
said
angrily
you
need
not
be
afraid
i
shall
do
nothing
elsewhere
that
i
would
not
do
here
and
nothing
anywhere
without
telling
you
i
know
i
can
trust
you
but
papa
i
shall
always
intend
to
marry
mr
tregear
no
he
exclaimed
yes
always
i
want
you
to
understand
exactly
how
it
is
nothing
you
can
do
can
separate
me
from
him
mary
that
is
very
wicked
it
can
not
be
wicked
to
tell
the
truth
papa
i
mean
to
try
to
do
all
that
you
tell
me
i
shall
not
see
him
or
write
to
him
unless
there
should
be
some
very
particular
reason
and
if
i
did
see
him
or
write
to
him
i
would
tell
you
and
of
course
i
should
not
think
of
of
marrying
without
your
leave
but
i
shall
expect
you
to
let
me
marry
him
never
then
i
shall
think
you
are
cruel
and
you
will
break
my
heart
you
should
not
call
your
father
cruel
i
hope
you
will
not
be
cruel
i
can
never
permit
you
to
marry
this
man
it
would
be
altogether
improper
i
can
not
allow
you
to
say
that
i
am
cruel
because
i
do
what
i
feel
to
be
my
duty
you
will
see
other
people
a
great
many
perhaps
and
will
learn
to
to
to
forget
him
never
i
will
not
forget
him
i
should
hate
myself
if
i
thought
it
possible
what
would
love
be
worth
if
it
could
be
forgotten
in
that
way
as
he
heard
this
he
reflected
whether
his
own
wife
this
mother
had
ever
forgotten
her
early
love
for
that
burgo
fitzgerald
whom
in
her
girlhood
she
had
wished
to
marry
when
he
was
leaving
her
she
called
him
back
again
there
is
one
other
thing
i
think
i
ought
to
say
papa
if
lady
cantrip
speaks
to
me
about
tregear
i
can
only
tell
her
what
i
have
told
you
i
shall
never
give
him
up
when
he
heard
this
he
turned
angrily
from
her
almost
stamping
his
foot
upon
the
ground
when
she
quietly
left
the
room
cruel
she
had
told
him
that
he
would
be
cruel
if
he
opposed
her
love
he
thought
he
knew
of
himself
that
he
could
not
be
cruel
even
to
a
fly
even
to
a
political
opponent
there
could
be
no
cruelty
without
dishonesty
and
did
he
not
always
struggle
to
be
honest
cruel
to
his
own
daughter
chapter
xii
at
richmond
the
pity
of
it
the
pity
of
it
it
was
thus
that
lady
cantrip
looked
at
it
from
what
the
girl
father
had
said
to
her
she
was
disposed
to
believe
that
the
malady
had
gone
deep
with
her
all
things
go
deep
with
her
he
had
said
and
she
too
from
other
sources
had
heard
something
of
this
girl
she
was
afraid
that
it
would
go
deep
it
was
a
thousand
pities
then
she
asked
herself
whether
the
marriage
ought
to
be
regarded
as
impossible
the
duke
had
been
very
positive
had
declared
again
and
again
that
it
was
quite
impossible
had
so
expressed
himself
as
to
make
her
aware
that
he
intended
her
to
understand
that
he
would
not
yield
whatever
the
sufferings
of
the
girl
might
be
but
lady
cantrip
knew
the
world
well
and
was
aware
that
in
such
matters
daughters
are
apt
to
be
stronger
than
their
fathers
he
had
declared
tregear
to
be
a
young
man
with
very
small
means
and
intent
on
such
pleasures
as
require
great
means
for
their
enjoyment
no
worse
character
could
be
given
to
a
gentleman
who
had
proposed
himself
as
a
but
lady
cantrip
thought
it
possible
that
the
duke
might
be
mistaken
in
this
she
had
never
seen
tregear
but
she
fancied
that
she
had
heard
his
name
and
that
the
name
had
been
connected
with
a
character
different
from
that
which
the
duke
had
given
him
lady
cantrip
who
at
this
time
was
a
woman
not
much
above
forty
had
two
daughters
both
of
whom
were
married
the
younger
about
a
year
since
had
become
the
wife
of
lord
nidderdale
a
young
man
who
had
been
long
about
town
a
cousin
of
the
late
duchess
the
heir
to
a
marquisate
and
a
member
of
parliament
the
marriage
had
not
been
considered
to
be
very
brilliant
but
the
husband
was
himself
and
pleasant
and
lady
cantrip
was
fond
of
him
in
the
first
place
she
went
to
him
for
information
oh
yes
i
know
him
he
one
of
our
set
at
the
beargarden
not
your
set
now
i
hope
she
said
laughing
well
i
do
see
so
much
of
them
as
i
used
to
do
tregear
is
not
a
bad
fellow
at
all
he
always
with
silverbridge
when
silverbridge
does
what
tregear
tells
him
he
goes
along
pretty
straight
but
unfortunately
there
another
man
called
tifto
and
when
tifto
is
in
the
ascendant
then
silverbridge
is
apt
to
get
a
little
astray
he
not
in
debt
then
who
tregear
i
should
think
he
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
owe
a
penny
to
any
one
is
he
a
betting
man
oh
dear
no
quite
the
other
way
up
he
a
severe
sarcastic
bookish
sort
of
fellow
a
chap
who
knows
everything
and
turns
up
his
nose
at
people
who
know
nothing
has
he
got
anything
of
his
own
not
much
i
should
say
if
he
had
had
any
money
he
would
have
married
lady
mab
grex
last
year
lady
cantrip
was
inclined
from
what
she
now
learned
to
think
that
the
duke
must
be
wrong
about
the
young
man
but
before
lady
mary
joined
her
she
made
further
inquiry
she
too
knew
lady
mabel
and
knowing
lady
mabel
she
knew
miss
cassewary
she
contrived
to
find
herself
alone
with
miss
cassewary
and
asked
some
further
questions
about
tregear
he
is
a
cousin
of
my
lord
said
miss
cass
so
i
thought
i
wonder
what
sort
of
a
young
man
he
is
he
is
a
good
deal
with
lord
silverbridge
then
miss
cassewary
spoke
her
opinion
very
plainly
if
lord
silverbridge
had
nobody
worse
about
him
than
tregear
he
would
not
come
to
much
harm
i
suppose
he
not
very
well
off
no
certainly
not
he
will
have
a
property
of
some
kind
i
believe
when
his
mother
dies
i
think
very
well
of
tregear
only
i
wish
that
he
had
a
profession
but
why
are
you
asking
about
him
lady
cantrip
nidderdale
was
talking
to
me
about
him
and
saying
that
he
was
so
much
with
lord
silverbridge
lord
silverbridge
is
going
into
parliament
now
and
as
it
were
beginning
the
world
and
it
would
be
a
thousand
pities
that
he
should
get
into
bad
hands
it
may
however
be
doubted
whether
miss
cassewary
was
hoodwinked
by
this
little
story
early
in
the
second
week
in
may
the
duke
brought
his
daughter
up
to
the
horns
and
at
the
same
time
expressed
his
intention
of
remaining
in
london
when
he
did
so
lady
mary
at
once
asked
whether
she
might
not
be
with
him
but
he
would
not
permit
it
the
house
in
london
would
he
said
be
more
gloomy
even
than
matching
i
am
quite
ashamed
of
giving
you
so
much
trouble
lady
mary
said
to
her
new
friend
we
are
delighted
to
have
you
my
dear
but
i
know
that
you
have
been
obliged
to
leave
london
because
i
am
with
you
there
is
nothing
i
like
so
much
as
this
place
which
your
father
has
been
kind
enough
to
lend
us
as
for
london
there
is
nothing
now
to
make
me
like
being
there
both
my
girls
are
married
and
therefore
i
regard
myself
as
an
old
woman
who
has
done
her
work
do
you
think
this
place
very
much
nicer
than
london
at
this
time
of
the
year
i
do
know
london
at
all
i
had
only
just
been
brought
out
when
poor
mamma
went
abroad
the
life
they
led
was
very
quiet
and
must
probably
have
been
felt
to
be
dull
by
lady
cantrip
in
spite
of
her
old
age
and
desire
for
retirement
but
the
place
itself
was
very
lovely
may
of
all
the
months
of
the
year
is
in
england
the
most
insidious
the
most
dangerous
and
the
most
inclement
a
greatcoat
can
not
be
endured
and
without
a
greatcoat
who
can
endure
a
may
wind
and
live
but
of
all
months
it
is
the
prettiest
the
grasses
are
then
the
greenest
and
the
young
foliage
of
the
trees
while
it
has
all
the
glory
and
all
the
colour
of
spring
vegetation
does
not
hide
the
form
of
the
branches
as
do
the
heavy
masses
of
the
larger
leaves
which
come
in
the
advancing
summer
and
of
all
villas
near
london
the
horns
was
the
sweetest
the
broad
green
lawn
swept
down
to
the
very
margin
of
the
thames
which
absolutely
washed
the
fringe
of
grass
when
the
tide
was
high
and
here
along
the
bank
was
a
row
of
flowering
ashes
the
drooping
boughs
of
which
in
places
touched
the
water
it
was
one
of
those
spots
which
when
they
are
first
seen
make
the
beholder
feel
that
to
be
able
to
live
there
and
look
at
it
always
would
be
happiness
enough
for
life
at
the
end
of
the
week
there
came
a
visitor
to
see
lady
mary
a
very
pretty
carriage
was
driven
up
to
the
door
of
the
horns
and
the
servant
asked
for
lady
mary
palliser
the
owner
of
that
carriage
was
finn
now
it
must
be
explained
to
the
reader
that
there
had
never
been
any
friendship
between
finn
and
lady
cantrip
though
the
ladies
had
met
each
other
the
great
political
intimacy
which
had
existed
between
the
duke
and
lord
cantrip
had
created
some
intimacy
also
between
their
wives
the
duchess
and
lady
cantrip
had
been
friends
after
a
fashion
but
finn
had
never
been
cordially
accepted
by
those
among
whom
lady
cantrip
chiefly
lived
when
therefore
the
name
was
announced
the
servant
expressly
stating
that
the
visitor
had
asked
for
lady
mary
lady
cantrip
who
was
with
her
guest
had
to
bethink
herself
what
she
would
do
the
duke
who
was
at
this
time
very
full
of
wrath
against
finn
had
not
mentioned
this
lady
name
when
delivering
up
the
charge
of
his
daughter
to
lady
cantrip
at
this
moment
it
occurred
to
her
that
not
improbably
finn
would
cease
to
be
included
in
the
intimacies
of
the
palliser
family
from
the
time
of
the
death
of
the
duchess
that
the
duke
would
not
care
to
maintain
the
old
relations
and
that
he
would
be
as
little
anxious
to
do
it
for
his
daughter
as
for
himself
if
so
could
it
be
right
that
finn
should
come
down
here
to
a
house
which
was
now
in
the
occupation
of
a
lady
with
whom
she
was
not
on
inviting
terms
in
order
that
she
might
thus
force
herself
on
the
duke
daughter
finn
had
not
left
her
carriage
but
had
sent
in
to
ask
if
lady
mary
could
see
her
in
all
this
there
was
considerable
embarrassment
she
looked
round
at
her
guest
who
had
at
once
risen
from
her
chair
would
you
wish
to
see
her
asked
lady
cantrip
oh
yes
certainly
have
you
seen
her
since
since
you
came
home
from
italy
oh
dear
yes
she
was
down
at
matching
when
poor
mamma
died
and
papa
persuaded
her
to
remain
afterwards
of
course
i
will
see
her
then
the
servant
was
desired
to
ask
finn
to
come
in
and
while
this
was
being
done
lady
cantrip
retired
finn
embraced
her
young
friend
and
asked
after
her
welfare
and
after
the
welfare
of
the
house
in
which
she
was
staying
a
house
with
which
finn
herself
had
been
well
acquainted
and
said
pretty
little
things
in
her
own
quiet
pretty
way
before
she
spoke
of
the
matter
which
had
really
brought
her
to
the
horns
on
that
day
i
have
had
a
correspondence
with
your
father
mary
indeed
and
unfortunately
one
that
has
been
far
from
agreeable
to
me
i
am
sorry
for
that
mrs
finn
so
am
i
very
sorry
i
may
say
with
perfect
truth
that
there
is
no
man
in
the
world
except
my
own
husband
for
whom
i
feel
so
perfect
an
esteem
as
i
do
for
your
father
if
it
were
not
that
i
do
not
like
to
be
carried
away
by
strong
language
i
would
speak
of
more
than
esteem
through
your
dear
mother
i
have
watched
his
conduct
closely
and
have
come
to
think
that
there
is
perhaps
no
other
man
at
the
same
time
so
just
and
so
patriotic
now
he
is
very
angry
with
me
and
most
unjustly
angry
is
it
about
me
yes
it
is
about
you
had
it
not
been
altogether
about
you
i
would
not
have
troubled
you
and
about
yes
about
tregear
also
when
i
tell
you
that
there
has
been
a
correspondence
i
must
explain
that
i
have
written
one
long
letter
to
the
duke
and
that
in
answer
i
have
received
a
very
short
one
that
has
been
the
whole
correspondence
here
is
your
father
letter
to
me
then
she
brought
out
of
her
pocket
a
note
which
lady
mary
read
covered
with
blushes
as
she
did
so
the
note
was
as
follows
the
duke
of
omnium
understands
from
finn
letter
that
finn
while
she
was
the
duke
guest
at
matching
was
aware
of
a
certain
circumstance
affecting
the
duke
honour
and
happiness
which
circumstance
she
certainly
did
not
communicate
to
the
duke
the
duke
thinks
that
the
trust
which
had
been
placed
in
finn
should
have
made
such
a
communication
imperative
the
duke
feels
that
no
further
correspondence
between
himself
and
finn
on
the
matter
could
lead
to
any
good
result
do
you
understand
it
asked
finn
i
think
so
it
simply
means
this
that
when
at
matching
he
had
thought
me
worthy
of
having
for
a
time
the
charge
of
you
and
of
your
welfare
that
he
had
trusted
me
who
was
the
friend
of
your
dear
mother
to
take
for
a
time
in
regard
to
you
the
place
which
had
been
so
unhappily
left
vacant
by
her
death
and
it
means
also
that
i
deceived
him
and
betrayed
that
trust
by
being
privy
to
an
engagement
on
your
part
of
which
he
disapproves
and
of
which
he
was
not
then
aware
i
suppose
he
does
mean
that
yes
lady
mary
that
is
what
he
means
and
he
means
further
to
let
me
know
that
as
i
did
so
foully
betray
the
trust
which
he
had
placed
in
me
that
as
i
had
consented
to
play
the
part
of
assistant
to
you
in
that
secret
engagement
therefore
he
casts
me
off
as
altogether
unworthy
of
his
esteem
and
acquaintance
it
is
as
though
he
had
told
me
in
so
many
words
that
among
women
he
had
known
none
more
vile
or
more
false
than
i
not
that
mrs
finn
yes
that
all
of
that
he
tells
me
that
and
then
says
that
there
shall
be
no
more
words
spoken
or
written
about
it
i
can
hardly
submit
to
so
stern
a
judgment
you
know
the
truth
lady
mary
do
not
call
me
lady
mary
do
not
quarrel
with
me
if
your
father
has
quarrelled
with
me
it
would
not
be
fit
that
you
and
i
should
be
friends
your
duty
to
him
would
forbid
it
i
should
not
have
come
to
you
now
did
i
not
feel
that
i
am
bound
to
justify
myself
the
thing
of
which
i
am
accused
is
so
repugnant
to
me
that
i
am
obliged
to
do
something
and
to
say
something
even
though
the
subject
itself
be
one
on
which
i
would
so
willingly
be
silent
what
can
i
do
mrs
finn
it
was
tregear
who
first
told
me
that
your
father
was
angry
with
me
he
knew
what
i
had
done
and
why
and
he
was
bound
to
tell
me
in
order
that
i
might
have
an
opportunity
of
setting
myself
right
with
the
duke
then
i
wrote
and
explained
everything
how
you
had
told
me
of
the
engagement
and
how
i
had
then
urged
tregear
that
he
should
not
keep
such
a
matter
secret
from
your
father
in
answer
to
my
letter
i
have
received
that
shall
i
write
and
tell
papa
he
should
be
made
to
understand
that
from
the
moment
in
which
i
heard
of
the
engagement
i
was
urgent
with
you
and
with
tregear
that
he
should
be
informed
of
it
you
will
remember
what
passed
i
remember
it
all
i
did
not
conceive
it
to
be
my
duty
to
tell
the
duke
myself
but
i
did
conceive
it
to
be
my
duty
to
see
he
should
be
told
now
he
writes
as
though
i
had
known
the
secret
from
the
first
and
as
though
i
had
been
concealing
it
from
him
at
the
very
moment
in
which
he
was
asking
me
to
remain
at
matching
on
your
behalf
that
i
consider
to
be
hard
and
unjust
i
can
not
deny
what
he
says
i
did
know
of
it
while
i
was
at
matching
for
it
was
at
matching
that
you
told
me
but
he
implies
that
i
knew
it
before
when
you
told
me
your
story
i
did
feel
that
it
was
my
duty
to
see
that
the
matter
was
not
kept
longer
from
him
and
i
did
my
duty
now
your
father
takes
upon
himself
to
rebuke
me
and
takes
upon
himself
at
the
same
time
to
forbid
me
to
write
to
him
again
i
will
tell
him
all
mrs
finn
let
him
understand
this
i
do
not
wish
to
write
to
him
again
after
what
has
passed
i
can
not
say
i
wish
to
see
him
again
but
i
think
he
should
acknowledge
to
me
that
he
has
been
mistaken
he
need
not
then
fear
that
i
shall
trouble
him
with
any
reply
but
i
shall
know
that
he
has
acquitted
me
of
a
fault
of
which
i
can
not
bear
to
think
i
should
be
accused
then
she
took
a
somewhat
formal
though
still
an
affectionate
farewell
of
the
girl
i
want
to
see
papa
as
soon
as
possible
said
lady
mary
when
she
was
again
with
lady
cantrip
the
reason
for
her
wish
was
soon
given
and
then
the
whole
story
told
you
do
not
think
that
she
should
have
gone
to
papa
at
once
lady
mary
asked
it
was
a
point
of
moral
law
on
which
the
elder
woman
who
had
had
girls
of
her
own
found
it
hard
to
give
an
immediate
answer
it
certainly
is
expedient
that
parents
should
know
at
once
of
any
engagement
by
which
their
daughters
may
seek
to
contract
themselves
it
is
expedient
that
they
should
be
able
to
prevent
any
secret
contracts
lady
cantrip
felt
strongly
that
finn
having
accepted
the
confidential
charge
of
the
daughter
could
not
without
gross
betrayal
of
trust
allow
herself
to
be
the
depositary
of
such
a
secret
but
she
did
not
allow
herself
said
lady
mary
pleading
for
her
friend
but
she
left
the
house
without
telling
him
my
dear
but
it
was
because
of
what
she
did
that
he
was
told
that
is
true
but
i
doubt
whether
she
should
have
left
him
an
hour
in
ignorance
but
it
was
i
who
told
her
she
would
have
betrayed
me
she
was
not
a
fit
recipient
for
your
confidence
mary
but
i
do
not
wish
to
accuse
her
she
seems
to
be
a
woman
and
i
think
that
your
papa
has
been
hard
upon
her
and
mamma
knew
it
always
said
mary
to
this
lady
cantrip
could
give
no
answer
whatever
cause
for
anger
the
duke
might
have
against
finn
there
had
been
cause
for
much
more
against
his
wife
but
she
had
freed
herself
from
all
accusation
by
death
lady
mary
wrote
to
her
father
declaring
that
she
was
most
particularly
anxious
to
see
him
and
talk
to
him
about

xiii

no
advantage
whatever
was
obtained
by
lady
mary
interview
with
her
father
he
persisted
that
finn
had
been
untrue
to
him
when
she
left
matching
without
telling
him
all
that
she
knew
of
his
engagement
with
tregear
no
doubt
by
degrees
that
idea
which
he
at
first
entertained
was
expelled
from
his
head
the
idea
that
she
had
been
cognisant
of
the
whole
thing
before
she
came
to
matching
but
even
this
was
done
so
slowly
that
there
was
no
moment
at
which
he
became
aware
of
any
lessened
feeling
of
indignation
to
his
thinking
she
had
betrayed
her
trust
and
he
could
not
be
got
by
his
daughter
to
say
that
he
would
forgive
her
he
certainly
could
not
be
got
to
say
that
he
would
apologise
for
the
accusation
he
had
made
it
was
nothing
less
that
his
daughter
asked
and
he
could
hardly
refrain
himself
from
anger
when
she
asked
it
there
should
not
have
been
a
moment
he
said
before
she
came
to
me
and
told
me
all
poor
lady
mary
position
was
certainly
uncomfortable
enough
the
great
sin
the
sin
which
was
so
great
that
to
have
known
it
for
a
day
without
revealing
it
was
in
itself
a
damning
sin
on
the
part
of
finn
was
lady
mary
sin
and
she
differed
so
entirely
from
her
father
as
to
think
that
this
sin
of
her
own
was
a
virtue
and
that
to
have
spoken
of
it
to
him
would
have
been
on
the
part
of
finn
a
treachery
so
deep
that
no
woman
ought
to
have
forgiven
it
when
he
spoke
of
a
matter
which
deeply
affected
his
honour
she
could
hardly
refrain
from
asserting
that
his
honour
was
quite
safe
in
his
daughter
hands
and
when
in
his
heart
he
declared
that
it
should
have
been
finn
first
care
to
save
him
from
disgrace
lady
mary
did
break
out
papa
there
could
be
no
disgrace
that
for
a
moment
shall
be
laid
aside
he
said
with
that
manner
by
which
even
his
peers
in
council
had
never
been
able
not
to
be
awed
but
if
you
communicate
with
finn
at
all
you
must
make
her
understand
that
i
regard
her
conduct
as
inexcusable
nothing
had
been
gained
and
poor
lady
mary
was
compelled
to
write
a
few
lines
which
were
to
her
most
painful
in
writing
my
dear
finn
i
have
seen
papa
and
he
thinks
that
you
ought
to
have
told
him
when
i
told
you
it
occurs
to
me
that
that
would
have
been
a
cruel
thing
to
do
and
most
unfair
to
tregear
who
was
quite
willing
to
go
to
papa
and
had
only
put
off
doing
so
because
of
poor
mamma
death
as
i
had
told
mamma
of
course
it
was
right
that
he
should
tell
papa
then
i
told
you
because
you
were
so
kind
to
me
i
am
so
sorry
that
i
have
got
you
into
this
trouble
but
what
can
i
do
i
told
him
i
must
write
to
you
i
suppose
it
is
better
that
i
should
although
what
i
have
to
say
is
so
unpleasant
i
hope
it
will
all
blow
over
in
time
because
i
love
you
dearly
you
may
be
quite
sure
of
one
thing
that
i
shall
never
change
in
this
assurance
the
writer
was
alluding
not
to
her
friendship
for
her
friend
but
her
love
for
her
lover
and
so
the
friend
understood
her
i
hope
things
will
be
settled
some
day
and
then
we
may
be
able
to
meet
your
very
affectionate
friend
mary
palliser
finn
when
she
received
this
was
alone
in
her
house
in
park
lane
her
husband
was
down
in
the
north
of
england
on
this
subject
she
had
not
spoken
to
him
fearing
that
he
would
feel
himself
bound
to
take
some
steps
to
support
his
wife
under
the
treatment
she
had
received
even
though
she
must
quarrel
with
the
duke
she
was
most
anxious
that
her
husband
should
not
be
compelled
to
do
so
their
connection
had
been
political
rather
than
personal
there
were
many
reasons
why
there
should
be
no
open
cause
of
disruption
between
them
but
her
husband
was
and
were
all
this
to
be
told
him
and
that
letter
shown
to
him
which
the
duke
had
written
there
would
be
words
between
him
and
the
duke
which
would
probably
make
impossible
any
further
connection
between
them
it
troubled
her
very
much
she
was
by
no
means
not
alive
to
the
honour
of
the
duke
friendship
throughout
her
intimacy
with
the
duchess
she
had
abstained
from
pressing
herself
on
him
not
because
she
had
been
indifferent
about
him
but
that
she
had
perceived
that
she
might
make
her
way
with
him
better
by
standing
aloof
than
by
thrusting
herself
forward
and
she
had
known
that
she
had
been
successful
she
could
tell
herself
with
pride
that
her
conduct
towards
him
had
been
always
such
as
would
become
a
lady
of
high
spirit
and
fine
feeling
she
knew
that
she
had
deserved
well
of
him
that
in
all
her
intercourse
with
him
with
his
uncle
and
with
his
wife
she
had
given
much
and
had
taken
little
she
was
the
last
woman
in
the
world
to
let
a
word
on
such
a
matter
pass
her
lips
but
not
the
less
was
she
conscious
of
her
merit
towards
him
and
she
had
been
led
to
act
as
she
had
done
by
sincere
admiration
for
the
man
in
all
their
political
troubles
she
had
understood
him
better
than
the
duchess
had
done
looking
on
from
a
distance
she
had
understood
the
man
character
as
it
had
come
to
her
both
from
his
wife
and
from
her
own
husband
that
he
was
unjust
to
her
cruelly
unjust
she
was
quite
sure
he
accused
her
of
intentional
privity
to
a
secret
which
it
behoved
him
to
know
and
of
being
a
party
to
that
secrecy
whereas
from
the
moment
in
which
she
had
heard
the
secret
she
had
determined
that
it
must
be
made
known
to
him
she
felt
that
she
had
deserved
his
good
opinion
in
all
things
but
in
nothing
more
than
in
the
way
in
which
she
had
acted
in
this
matter
and
yet
he
had
treated
her
with
an
imperious
harshness
which
amounted
to
insolence
what
a
letter
it
was
that
he
had
written
to
her
the
very
tips
of
her
ears
tingled
with
heat
as
she
read
it
again
to
herself
none
of
the
ordinary
courtesies
of
had
been
preserved
either
in
the
beginning
or
in
the
end
it
was
worse
even
than
if
he
had
called
her
madam
without
an
epithet
the
duke
understands
the
duke
thinks
the
duke
feels
feels
that
he
should
not
be
troubled
with
either
letters
or
conversation
the
upshot
of
it
all
being
that
the
duke
declared
her
to
have
shown
herself
unworthy
of
being
treated
like
a
lady
and
this
after
all
that
she
had
done
she
would
not
bear
it
that
at
present
was
all
that
she
could
say
to
herself
she
was
not
angry
with
lady
mary
she
did
not
doubt
but
that
the
girl
had
done
the
best
in
her
power
to
bring
her
father
to
reason
but
because
lady
mary
had
failed
she
finn
was
not
going
to
put
up
with
so
grievous
an
injury
and
she
was
forced
to
bear
all
this
alone
there
was
none
with
whom
she
could
communicate
no
one
from
whom
she
could
ask
advice
she
would
not
bring
her
husband
into
a
quarrel
which
might
be
prejudicial
to
his
position
as
a
member
of
his
political
party
there
was
no
one
else
to
whom
she
would
tell
the
secret
of
lady
mary
love
and
yet
she
could
not
bear
this
injustice
done
to
her
then
she
wrote
as
follows
to
the

her

it
to

chapter
xiv
the
new
member
for
silverbridge
lord
silverbridge
was
informed
that
it
would
be
right
that
he
should
go
down
to
silverbridge
a
few
days
before
the
election
to
make
himself
known
to
the
electors
as
the
day
for
the
election
drew
near
it
was
understood
that
there
would
be
no
other
candidate
the
conservative
side
was
the
popular
side
among
the
tradesmen
of
silverbridge
silverbridge
had
been
proud
to
be
honoured
by
the
services
of
the
heir
of
the
house
of
omnium
even
while
that
heir
had
been
a
liberal
had
regarded
it
as
so
much
a
matter
of
course
that
the
borough
should
be
at
his
disposal
that
no
question
as
to
politics
had
ever
arisen
while
he
retained
the
seat
and
had
the
duke
chosen
to
continue
to
send
them
liberals
one
after
another
when
he
went
into
the
house
of
lords
there
would
have
been
no
question
as
to
the
fitness
of
the
man
or
men
so
sent
silverbridge
had
been
supposed
to
be
a
liberal
as
a
matter
of
course
because
the
pallisers
were
liberals
but
when
the
matter
was
remitted
to
themselves
when
the
duke
declared
that
he
would
not
interfere
any
more
for
it
was
thus
that
the
borough
had
obtained
its
freedom
then
the
borough
began
to
feel
conservative
predilections
if
his
grace
really
does
mean
us
to
do
just
what
we
please
ourselves
which
is
a
thing
we
never
thought
of
asking
from
his
grace
then
we
find
having
turned
the
matter
over
among
ourselves
that
we
are
upon
the
whole
conservative
in
this
spirit
the
borough
had
elected
a
certain
fletcher
but
in
doing
so
the
borough
had
still
a
shade
of
fear
that
it
would
offend
the
duke
the
house
of
palliser
gatherum
castle
the
duke
of
omnium
and
this
special
duke
himself
were
all
so
great
in
the
eyes
of
the
borough
that
the
first
and
only
strong
feeling
in
the
borough
was
the
one
of
duty
the
borough
did
not
altogether
enjoy
being
enfranchised
but
when
the
duke
had
spoken
once
twice
and
thrice
then
with
a
hesitating
heart
the
borough
returned
fletcher
now
fletcher
was
wanted
elsewhere
having
been
persuaded
to
stand
for
the
county
and
it
was
a
comfort
to
the
borough
that
it
could
resettle
itself
beneath
the
warmth
of
the
wings
of
the
pallisers
so
the
matter
stood
when
lord
silverbridge
was
told
that
his
presence
in
the
borough
for
a
few
hours
would
be
taken
as
a
compliment
hitherto
no
one
knew
him
at
silverbridge
during
his
boyhood
he
had
not
been
much
at
gatherum
castle
and
had
done
his
best
to
eschew
the
place
since
he
had
ceased
to
be
a
boy
all
the
pallisers
took
a
pride
in
gatherum
castle
but
they
all
disliked
it
oh
yes
i
go
down
he
said
to
morton
who
was
up
in
town
i
need
go
to
the
great
barrack
i
suppose
the
great
barrack
was
the
castle
i
put
up
at
the
inn
morton
begged
the
heir
to
come
to
his
own
house
but
silverbridge
declared
that
he
would
prefer
the
inn
and
so
the
matter
was
settled
he
was
to
meet
sundry
politicians
sprugeon
and
sprout
and
du
boung
who
would
like
to
be
thanked
for
what
they
had
done
but
who
was
to
go
with
him
he
would
naturally
have
asked
tregear
but
from
tregear
he
had
for
the
last
week
or
two
been
not
perhaps
estranged
but
separated
he
had
been
much
taken
up
with
racing
he
had
gone
down
to
chester
with
major
tifto
and
under
the
major
auspicious
influences
had
won
a
little
money
and
now
he
was
very
anxiously
preparing
himself
for
the
newmarket
second
spring
meeting
he
had
therefore
passed
much
of
his
time
with
major
tifto
and
when
this
visit
to
silverbridge
was
pressed
on
him
he
thoughtlessly
asked
tifto
to
go
with
him
tifto
was
delighted
lord
silverbridge
was
to
be
met
at
silverbridge
by
various
politicians
from
the
neighbourhood
and
major
tifto
was
greatly
elated
by
the
prospect
of
such
an
introduction
into
the
political
world
but
no
sooner
had
the
offer
been
made
by
lord
silverbridge
than
he
saw
his
own
indiscretion
tifto
was
very
well
for
chester
or
newmarket
very
well
perhaps
for
the
beargarden
but
not
very
well
for
an
electioneering
expedition
an
idea
came
to
the
young
nobleman
that
if
it
should
be
his
fate
to
represent
silverbridge
in
parliament
for
the
next
twenty
years
it
would
be
well
that
silverbridge
should
entertain
respecting
him
some
exalted
estimation
that
silverbridge
should
be
taught
to
regard
him
as
a
fit
son
of
his
father
and
a
worthy
specimen
of
the
british
political
nobility
struck
by
serious
reflections
of
this
nature
he
did
open
his
mind
to
tregear
i
am
very
fond
of
tifto
he
said
but
i
do
know
whether
he
just
the
sort
of
fellow
to
take
down
to
an
election
i
should
think
not
said
tregear
very
decidedly
he
a
very
good
fellow
you
know
said
silverbridge
i
do
know
an
honester
man
than
tifto
anywhere
i
dare
say
or
rather
i
do
dare
say
i
know
nothing
about
the
major
honesty
and
i
doubt
whether
you
do
he
rides
very
well
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
nothing
on
earth
therefore
i
advise
you
not
to
take
him
to
silverbridge
you
need
preach
you
may
call
it
what
you
like
tifto
would
not
hold
his
tongue
and
there
is
nothing
he
could
say
there
which
would
not
be
to
your
prejudice
will
you
go
if
you
wish
it
said
tregear
what
will
the
governor
say
that
must
be
your
in
a
political
point
of
view
i
shall
not
disgrace
you
i
shall
hold
my
tongue
and
look
like
a
gentleman
neither
of
which
is
in
tifto
power
and
so
it
was
settled
that
on
the
day
but
one
after
this
conversation
lord
silverbridge
and
tregear
should
go
together
to
silverbridge
but
the
major
when
on
the
same
night
his
noble
friend
altered
plans
were
explained
to
him
did
not
bear
the
disappointment
with
equanimity
is
that
a
little
strange
he
said
becoming
very
red
in
the
face
what
do
you
call
strange
said
the
lord
well
i
made
all
my
arrangements
when
a
man
has
been
asked
to
do
a
thing
like
that
he
does
like
to
be
put
off
the
truth
is
tifto
when
i
came
to
think
of
it
i
saw
that
going
down
to
these
fellows
about
parliament
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
ought
to
have
a
political
atmosphere
and
not
a
racing
or
a
betting
or
a
hunting
atmosphere
there
is
a
man
in
london
who
cares
more
about
politics
than
i
do
and
not
very
many
perhaps
who
understand
them
better
to
tell
you
the
truth
my
lord
i
think
you
are
throwing
me
over
i
make
it
up
to
you
said
silverbridge
meaning
to
be
kind
i
go
down
to
newmarket
with
you
and
stick
to
you
like
wax
no
doubt
you
do
that
said
tifto
who
like
a
fool
failed
to
see
where
his
advantage
lay
i
can
be
useful
at
newmarket
and
so
you
stick
to
me
look
here
major
tifto
said
silverbridge
if
you
are
dissatisfied
you
and
i
can
easily
separate
ourselves
i
am
not
dissatisfied
said
the
little
man
almost
crying
then
do
talk
as
though
you
were
as
to
silverbridge
i
shall
not
want
you
there
when
i
asked
you
i
was
only
thinking
what
would
be
pleasant
to
both
of
us
but
since
that
i
have
remembered
that
business
must
be
business
even
this
did
not
reconcile
the
angry
little
man
who
as
he
turned
away
declared
within
his
own
little
bosom
that
he
would
take
it
out
of
silverbridge
for
that
lord
silverbridge
and
tregear
went
down
to
the
borough
together
and
on
the
journey
something
was
said
about
lady
mary
and
something
also
about
lady
mabel
from
the
first
you
know
said
lady
brother
i
never
thought
it
would
answer
why
not
answer
because
i
knew
the
governor
would
not
have
it
money
and
rank
and
those
sort
of
things
are
not
particularly
charming
to
me
but
still
things
should
go
together
it
is
all
very
well
for
you
and
me
to
be
pals
but
of
course
it
will
be
expected
that
mary
should
marry
some
some
swell
some
swell
if
you
will
have
it
you
mean
to
call
yourself
a
swell
yes
i
do
said
silverbridge
with
considerable
resolution
you
ought
not
to
make
yourself
disagreeable
because
you
understand
all
about
it
as
well
as
anybody
chance
has
made
me
the
eldest
son
of
a
duke
and
heir
to
an
enormous
fortune
chance
has
made
my
sister
the
daughter
of
a
duke
and
an
heiress
also
my
intimacy
with
you
ought
to
be
proof
at
any
rate
to
you
that
i
do
on
that
account
set
myself
up
above
other
fellows
but
when
you
come
to
talk
of
marriage
of
course
it
is
a
serious
thing
but
you
have
told
me
more
than
once
that
you
have
no
objection
on
your
own
score
nor
have
i
you
are
only
saying
what
the
duke
will
think
i
am
telling
you
that
it
is
impossible
and
i
told
you
so
before
you
and
she
will
be
kept
apart
and
so
and
so
she
forget
me
something
of
that
kind
of
course
i
have
to
trust
to
her
for
that
if
she
forgets
me
well
and
good
she
need
forget
you
lord
bless
me
you
talk
as
though
the
thing
were
not
done
every
day
you
hear
some
morning
that
she
is
going
to
marry
some
fellow
who
has
a
lot
of
money
and
a
good
position
and
what
difference
will
it
make
then
whether
she
has
forgotten
you
or
not
it
might
almost
have
been
supposed
that
the
young
man
had
been
acquainted
with
his
mother
history
after
this
there
was
a
pause
and
there
arose
conversation
about
other
things
and
a
cigar
was
smoked
then
tregear
returned
once
more
to
the
subject
there
is
one
thing
i
wish
to
say
about
it
all
what
is
that
i
want
you
to
understand
that
nothing
else
will
turn
me
away
from
my
intention
but
such
a
marriage
on
her
part
as
that
of
which
you
speak
nothing
that
your
father
can
do
will
turn
me
she
ca
marry
without
his
leave
perhaps
not
that
he
never
give
and
i
do
suppose
you
look
forward
to
waiting
till
his
death
if
he
sees
that
her
happiness
really
depends
on
it
he
will
give
his
leave
it
all
depends
on
that
if
i
judge
your
father
rightly
just
as
as
other
people
the
man
who
holds
out
is
not
the
man
of
the
firmest
opinion
but
the
man
of
the
hardest
heart
somebody
will
talk
mary
over
if
so
the
thing
is
over
it
all
depends
on
her
then
he
went
on
to
tell
his
friend
that
he
had
spoken
of
his
engagement
to
lady
mabel
i
have
mentioned
it
to
no
soul
but
to
your
father
and
to
her
why
to
her
because
we
were
friends
together
as
children
i
never
had
a
sister
but
she
has
been
more
like
a
sister
to
me
than
any
one
else
do
you
object
to
her
knowing
it
not
particularly
it
seems
to
me
now
that
everybody
knows
everything
there
are
no
longer
any
secrets
but
she
is
a
special
friend
of
yours
said
silverbridge
and
of
yours
said
tregear
well
yes
in
a
sort
of
way
she
is
the
jolliest
girl
i
know
take
her
all
round
for
beauty
intellect
good
sense
and
fun
at
the
same
time
i
do
know
any
one
equal
to
her
it
a
pity
you
did
fall
in
love
with
her
we
knew
each
other
too
early
for
that
and
then
she
has
not
a
shilling
i
should
think
myself
dishonest
if
i
did
not
tell
you
that
i
could
not
afford
to
love
any
girl
who
had
money
a
man
must
live
and
a
woman
too
at
the
station
they
were
met
by
sprugeon
and
sprout
who
with
many
apologies
for
the
meanness
of
such
entertainment
took
them
up
to
the
george
and
vulture
which
was
supposed
for
the
nonce
to
be
the
conservative
hotel
in
the
town
here
they
were
met
by
other
men
of
importance
in
the
borough
and
among
them
by
du
boung
now
sprout
and
sprugeon
were
conservatives
but
du
boung
was
a
strong
liberal
we
are
all
of
us
particularly
glad
to
see
your
lordship
among
us
said
du
boung
i
have
told
his
lordship
how
perfectly
satisfied
you
are
to
see
the
borough
in
his
lordship
hands
said
sprugeon
i
am
sure
it
could
not
be
in
better
said
du
boung
for
myself
i
am
quite
willing
to
postpone
any
peculiar
shade
of
politics
to
the
advantage
of
having
your
father
son
as
our
representative
this
du
boung
said
with
much
intention
of
imparting
both
grace
and
dignity
to
the
occasion
he
thought
that
he
was
doing
a
great
thing
for
the
house
of
omnium
and
that
the
house
of
omnium
ought
to
know
it
that
very
kind
of
you
said
lord
silverbridge
who
had
not
read
as
carefully
as
he
should
have
done
the
letters
which
had
been
sent
to
him
and
did
not
therefore
quite
understand
the
position
du
boung
had
intended
to
stand
himself
said
sprout
but
retired
in
your
lordship
favour
said
sprugeon
in
doing
which
i
considered
that
i
studied
the
interest
of
the
borough
said
du
boung
i
thought
you
gave
it
up
because
there
was
hardly
a
footing
for
a
liberal
said
his
lordship
very
imprudently
the
borough
was
always
liberal
till
the
last
election
said
du
boung
drawing
himself
up
the
borough
wishes
on
this
occasion
to
be
magnanimous
said
sprout
probably
having
on
his
mind
some
confusion
between
magnanimity
and
unanimity
as
your
lordship
is
coming
among
us
the
borough
is
anxious
to
sink
politics
altogether
for
the
moment
said
sprugeon
there
had
no
doubt
been
a
compact
between
the
sprugeon
and
sprout
party
and
the
du
boung
party
in
accordance
with
which
it
had
been
arranged
that
du
boung
should
be
entitled
to
a
certain
amount
of
glorification
in
the
presence
of
lord
silverbridge
and
it
was
in
compliance
with
that
wish
on
the
part
of
the
borough
my
lord
said
du
boung
as
to
which
my
own
feelings
were
quite
as
strong
as
that
of
any
other
gentleman
in
the
borough
that
i
conceived
it
to
be
my
duty
to
give
way
his
lordship
is
quite
aware
how
much
he
owes
to
du
boung
said
tregear
whereupon
lord
silverbridge
bowed
and
now
what
are
we
to
do
said
lord
silverbridge
then
there
was
a
little
whispering
between
sprout
and
sprugeon
perhaps
du
boung
said
sprugeon
his
lordship
had
better
call
first
on
dr
tempest
perhaps
said
the
injured
brewer
as
it
is
to
be
a
party
affair
after
all
i
had
better
retire
from
the
scene
i
thought
all
that
was
to
be
given
up
said
tregear
oh
certainly
said
sprout
suppose
we
go
to
walker
first
i
up
to
anything
said
lord
silverbridge
but
of
course
everybody
understands
that
i
am
a
conservative
oh
dear
yes
said
sprugeon
we
are
all
aware
of
that
said
sprout
and
very
glad
we
all
of
us
been
to
hear
it
said
the
landlord
though
there
are
some
in
the
borough
who
could
have
wished
my
lord
that
you
had
stuck
to
the
old
palliser
politics
said
du
boung
but
i
have
stuck
to
the
palliser
politics
just
at
present
i
think
that
order
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
should
be
maintained
hear
hear
said
the
landlord
and
now
as
i
have
expressed
my
views
generally
i
am
willing
to
go
anywhere
then
we
go
to
walker
first
said
sprugeon
now
it
was
understood
that
in
the
borough
among
those
who
really
had
opinions
of
their
own
walker
the
old
attorney
stood
first
as
a
liberal
and
tempest
the
old
rector
first
as
a
conservative
i
am
glad
to
see
your
lordship
in
the
town
which
gives
you
its
name
said
walker
who
was
a
hale
old
gentleman
with
hair
over
seventy
years
of
age
i
proposed
your
father
for
this
borough
on
i
think
six
or
seven
different
occasions
they
used
to
go
in
and
out
then
whenever
they
changed
their
offices
we
hope
you
propose
lord
silverbridge
now
said
sprugeon
oh
well
yes
he
his
father
son
and
i
never
knew
anything
but
good
of
the
family
i
wish
you
were
going
to
sit
on
the
same
side
my
lord
times
are
changed
a
little
perhaps
said
his
lordship
the
matter
is
not
to
be
discussed
now
said
the
old
attorney
i
understand
that
only
i
hope
you
excuse
me
if
i
say
that
a
man
ought
to
get
up
very
early
in
the
morning
if
he
means
to
see
further
into
politics
than
your
father
very
early
indeed
said
du
boung
shaking
his
head
that
all
right
said
lord
silverbridge
i
propose
you
my
lord
i
need
not
wish
you
success
because
there
is
no
one
to
stand
against
you
then
they
went
to
tempest
who
was
also
an
old
man
yes
my
lord
i
shall
be
proud
to
second
you
said
the
rector
i
did
think
that
i
should
ever
do
that
to
one
of
your
name
in
silverbridge
i
hope
you
think
i
made
a
change
for
the
better
said
the
candidate
you
come
over
to
my
school
of
course
and
i
suppose
i
am
bound
to
think
that
a
change
for
the
better
nevertheless
i
have
a
kind
of
idea
that
certain
people
ought
to
be
tories
and
that
other
certain
people
ought
to
be
whigs
what
does
your
father
say
about
it
my
father
wishes
me
to
be
in
the
house
and
that
he
has
not
quarrelled
with
me
you
may
know
by
the
fact
that
had
there
been
a
contest
he
would
have
paid
my
expenses
a
father
generally
has
to
do
that
whether
he
approves
of
what
his
son
is
about
or
not
said
the
caustic
old
gentleman
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
they
all
went
back
to
the
hotel
and
sprugeon
with
sprout
and
the
landlord
drank
a
glass
of
sherry
at
the
candidate
expense
wishing
him
political
long
life
and
prosperity
there
was
no
one
else
whom
it
was
thought
necessary
that
the
candidate
should
visit
and
the
next
day
he
returned
to
town
with
the
understanding
that
on
the
day
appointed
in
the
next
week
he
should
come
back
again
to
be
elected
and
on
the
day
appointed
the
two
young
men
again
went
to
silverbridge
and
after
he
had
been
declared
duly
elected
the
new
member
of
parliament
made
his
first
speech
there
was
a
meeting
in
the
and
many
were
assembled
anxious
to
hear
not
the
opinions
for
which
probably
nobody
cared
much
but
the
tone
of
his
voice
and
to
see
his
manner
of
what
sort
was
the
eldest
son
of
the
man
of
whom
the
neighbourhood
had
been
so
proud
for
the
county
was
in
truth
proud
of
their
duke
of
this
son
whom
they
had
now
made
a
member
of
parliament
they
at
present
only
knew
that
he
had
been
sent
away
from
oxford
not
so
very
long
ago
for
painting
the
house
scarlet
the
speech
was
not
very
brilliant
he
told
them
that
he
was
very
much
obliged
to
them
for
the
honour
they
had
done
him
though
he
could
not
follow
exactly
his
father
political
opinions
he
would
always
have
before
his
eyes
his
political
honesty
and
independence
he
broke
down
two
or
three
times
and
blushed
and
repeated
himself
and
knocked
his
words
a
great
deal
too
quickly
one
on
the
top
of
another
but
it
was
taken
very
well
and
was
better
than
was
expected
when
it
was
over
he
wrote
a
line
to
the
duke
my
dear
father
i
am
member
of
parliament
for
silverbridge
as
you
used
to
be
in
the
days
which
i
can
first
remember
i
hope
you
wo
think
that
it
does
not
make
me
unhappy
to
have
differed
from
you
indeed
it
does
i
do
think
that
anybody
has
ever
done
so
well
in
politics
as
you
have
but
when
a
man
does
take
up
an
opinion
i
do
see
how
he
can
help
himself
of
course
i
could
have
kept
myself
quiet
but
then
you
wished
me
to
be
in
the
house
they
were
all
very
civil
to
me
at
silverbridge
but
there
was
very
little
said

affectionate
son

chapter
xv
the
duke
receives
a
letter
and
writes
one
the
duke
when
he
received
finn
note
demanding
an
interview
thought
much
upon
the
matter
before
he
replied
she
had
made
her
demand
as
though
the
duke
had
been
no
more
than
any
other
gentleman
almost
as
though
she
had
a
right
to
call
upon
him
to
wait
upon
her
he
understood
and
admired
the
courage
of
this
but
nevertheless
he
would
not
go
to
her
he
had
trusted
her
with
that
which
of
all
things
was
the
most
sacred
to
him
and
she
had
deceived
him
he
wrote
to
her
as
follows
the
duke
of
omnium
presents
his
compliments
to
finn
as
the
duke
thinks
that
no
good
could
result
either
to
finn
or
to
himself
from
an
interview
he
is
obliged
to
say
that
he
would
rather
not
do
as
finn
has
requested
but
for
the
strength
of
this
conviction
the
duke
would
have
waited
upon
finn
most
willingly
finn
when
she
received
this
was
not
surprised
she
had
felt
sure
that
such
would
be
the
nature
of
the
duke
answer
but
she
was
also
sure
that
if
such
an
answer
did
come
she
would
not
let
the
matter
rest
the
accusation
was
so
bitter
to
her
that
she
would
spare
nothing
in
defending
herself
nothing
in
labour
and
nothing
in
time
she
would
make
him
know
that
she
was
in
earnest
as
she
could
not
succeed
in
getting
into
his
presence
she
must
do
this
by
letter
and
she
wrote
her
letter
taking
two
days
to
think
of
her
words
may
my
dear
duke
of
omnium
as
you
will
not
come
to
me
i
must
trouble
your
grace
to
read
what
i
fear
will
be
a
long
letter
for
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
i
should
explain
my
conduct
to
you
that
you
have
condemned
me
i
am
sure
you
will
not
deny
nor
that
you
have
punished
me
as
far
as
the
power
of
punishment
was
in
your
hands
if
i
can
succeed
in
making
you
see
that
you
have
judged
me
wrongly
i
think
you
will
admit
your
error
and
beg
my
pardon
you
are
not
one
who
from
your
nature
can
be
brought
easily
to
do
this
but
you
are
one
who
will
certainly
do
it
if
you
can
be
made
to
feel
that
by
not
doing
so
you
would
be
unjust
i
am
myself
so
clear
as
to
my
own
rectitude
of
purpose
and
conduct
and
am
so
well
aware
of
your
perspicuity
that
i
venture
to
believe
that
if
you
will
read
this
letter
i
shall
convince
you
before
i
go
any
further
i
will
confess
that
the
matter
is
one
i
was
going
to
say
almost
of
life
and
death
to
me
circumstances
not
of
my
own
seeking
have
for
some
years
past
thrown
me
so
closely
into
intercourse
with
your
family
that
now
to
be
cast
off
and
to
be
put
on
one
side
as
a
disgraced
person
and
that
so
quickly
after
the
death
of
her
who
loved
me
so
dearly
and
who
was
so
dear
to
me
is
such
an
affront
as
i
can
not
bear
and
hold
up
my
head
afterwards
i
have
come
to
be
known
as
her
whom
your
uncle
trusted
and
loved
as
her
whom
your
wife
trusted
and
loved
obscure
as
i
was
before
and
as
her
whom
may
i
not
say
you
yourself
trusted
as
there
was
much
of
honour
and
very
much
of
pleasure
in
this
so
also
was
there
something
of
misfortune
friendships
are
safest
when
the
friends
are
of
the
same
standing
i
have
always
felt
there
was
danger
and
now
the
thing
i
feared
has
come
home
to
me
now
i
will
plead
my
case
i
fancy
that
when
first
you
heard
that
i
had
been
cognisant
of
your
engagement
you
imagined
that
i
was
aware
of
it
before
i
went
to
matching
had
i
been
so
i
should
have
been
guilty
of
that
treachery
of
which
you
accuse
me
i
did
know
nothing
of
it
till
lady
mary
told
me
on
the
day
before
i
left
matching
that
she
should
tell
me
was
natural
enough
her
mother
had
known
it
and
for
the
moment
if
i
am
not
assuming
too
much
in
saying
so
i
was
filling
her
mother
place
but
in
reference
to
you
i
could
not
exercise
the
discretion
which
a
mother
might
have
used
and
i
told
her
at
once
most
decidedly
that
you
must
be
made
acquainted
with
the
fact
then
lady
mary
expressed
to
me
her
wish
not
that
this
matter
should
be
kept
any
longer
from
you
for
that
it
should
be
told
she
was
as
anxious
as
i
was
myself
but
that
it
should
be
told
to
you
by
tregear
it
was
not
for
me
to
raise
any
question
as
to
tregear
fitness
or
unfitness
as
to
which
indeed
i
could
know
nothing
all
i
could
do
was
to
say
that
if
tregear
would
make
the
communication
at
once
i
should
feel
that
i
had
done
my
duty
the
upshot
was
that
tregear
came
to
me
immediately
on
my
return
to
london
and
agreeing
with
me
that
it
was
imperative
that
you
be
informed
went
to
you
and
did
inform
you
in
all
of
that
if
i
have
told
the
story
truly
where
has
been
my
offence
i
suppose
you
will
believe
me
but
your
daughter
can
give
evidence
as
to
every
word
that
i
have
written
i
think
that
you
have
got
it
into
your
mind
that
i
have
befriended
tregear
suit
and
that
having
received
this
impression
you
hold
it
with
the
tenacity
which
is
usual
to
you
there
never
was
a
greater
mistake
i
went
to
matching
as
the
friend
of
my
dear
friend
but
i
stayed
there
at
your
request
as
your
friend
had
i
been
when
you
asked
me
to
do
so
a
participator
in
that
secret
i
could
not
have
honestly
remained
in
the
position
you
assigned
to
me
had
i
done
so
i
should
have
deserved
your
ill
opinion
as
it
is
i
have
not
deserved
it
and
your
condemnation
of
me
has
been
altogether
unjust
should
i
not
now
receive
from
you
a
full
withdrawal
of
all
charge
against
me
i
shall
be
driven
to
think
that
after
all
the
insight
which
circumstances
have
given
me
into
your
character
i
have
nevertheless
been
mistaken
in
the
reading
of
it
i
remain
dear
duke
of
omnium
yours
truly
finn
i
find
on
looking
over
my
letter
that
i
must
add
one
word
further
it
might
seem
that
i
am
asking
for
a
return
of
your
friendship
such
is
not
my
purpose
neither
can
you
forget
that
you
have
accused
me
nor
can
i
what
i
expect
is
that
you
should
tell
me
that
you
in
your
conduct
to
me
have
been
wrong
and
that
i
in
mine
to
you
have
been
right
i
must
be
enabled
to
feel
that
the
separation
between
us
has
come
from
injury
done
to
me
and
not
by
me
he
did
read
the
letter
more
than
once
and
read
it
with
tingling
ears
and
hot
cheeks
and
a
knitted
brow
as
the
letter
went
on
and
as
the
woman
sense
of
wrong
grew
hot
from
her
own
telling
of
her
own
story
her
words
became
stronger
and
still
stronger
till
at
last
they
were
almost
insolent
in
their
strength
were
it
not
that
they
came
from
one
who
did
think
herself
to
have
been
wronged
then
certainly
they
would
be
insolent
a
sense
of
injury
a
burning
conviction
of
wrong
sustained
will
justify
language
which
otherwise
would
be
unbearable
the
duke
felt
that
and
though
his
ears
were
tingling
and
his
brow
knitted
he
could
have
forgiven
the
language
if
only
he
could
have
admitted
the
argument
he
understood
every
word
of
it
when
she
spoke
of
tenacity
she
intended
to
charge
him
with
obstinacy
though
she
had
dwelt
but
lightly
on
her
own
services
she
had
made
her
thoughts
on
the
matter
clear
enough
i
finn
who
am
nobody
have
done
much
to
succour
and
assist
you
the
duke
of
omnium
and
this
is
the
return
which
i
have
received
and
then
she
told
him
to
his
face
that
unless
he
did
something
which
it
would
be
impossible
that
he
should
do
she
would
revoke
her
opinion
of
his
honesty
he
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
her
opinion
about
his
honesty
was
nothing
to
him
but
he
failed
her
opinion
was
very
much
to
him
though
in
his
anger
he
had
determined
to
throw
her
off
from
him
he
knew
her
to
be
one
whose
good
opinion
was
worth
having
not
a
word
of
overt
accusation
had
been
made
against
his
wife
every
allusion
to
her
was
full
of
love
but
yet
how
heavy
a
charge
was
really
made
that
such
a
secret
should
be
kept
from
him
the
father
was
acknowledged
to
be
a
heinous
fault
but
the
wife
had
known
the
secret
and
had
kept
it
from
him
the
father
and
then
how
wretched
a
thing
it
was
for
him
that
any
one
should
dare
to
write
to
him
about
the
wife
that
had
been
taken
away
from
him
in
spite
of
all
her
faults
her
name
was
so
holy
to
him
that
it
had
never
once
passed
his
lips
since
her
death
except
in
low
whispers
to
himself
low
whispers
made
in
the
perfect
seclusion
of
his
own
chamber
cora
cora
he
had
murmured
so
that
the
sense
of
the
sound
and
not
the
sound
itself
had
come
to
him
from
his
own
lips
and
now
this
woman
wrote
to
him
about
her
freely
as
though
there
were
nothing
sacred
no
religion
in
the
memory
of
her
it
was
not
for
me
to
raise
any
question
as
to
fitness
was
it
not
palpable
to
all
the
world
that
he
was
unfit
unfit
how
could
a
man
be
more
unfit
he
was
asking
for
the
hand
of
one
who
was
second
only
to
royalty
who
was
possessed
of
everything
who
was
beautiful
rich
who
was
the
daughter
of
the
duke
of
omnium
and
he
had
absolutely
nothing
of
his
own
to
offer
but
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
at
last
come
to
the
consideration
of
the
actual
point
as
to
which
she
had
written
to
him
so
forcibly
he
tried
to
set
himself
to
the
task
in
perfect
honesty
he
certainly
had
condemned
her
he
had
condemned
her
and
had
no
doubt
punished
her
to
the
extent
of
his
power
and
if
he
could
be
brought
to
see
that
he
had
done
this
unjustly
then
certainly
must
he
beg
her
pardon
and
when
he
considered
it
all
he
had
to
own
that
her
intimacy
with
his
uncle
and
his
wife
had
not
been
so
much
of
her
seeking
as
of
theirs
it
grieved
him
now
that
it
should
have
been
so
but
so
it
was
and
after
all
this
after
the
affectionate
surrender
of
herself
to
his
wife
caprices
which
the
woman
had
made
he
had
turned
upon
her
and
driven
her
away
with
ignominy
that
was
all
true
as
he
thought
of
it
he
became
hot
and
was
conscious
of
a
quivering
feeling
round
his
heart
these
were
bonds
indeed
but
they
were
bonds
of
such
a
nature
as
to
be
capable
of
being
rescinded
and
cut
away
altogether
by
absolute
bad
conduct
if
he
could
make
it
good
to
himself
that
in
a
matter
of
such
magnitude
as
the
charge
of
his
daughter
she
had
been
untrue
to
him
and
had
leagued
herself
against
him
with
an
unworthy
lover
then
then
all
bonds
would
be
rescinded
then
would
his
wrath
be
altogether
justified
then
would
it
have
been
impossible
that
he
should
have
done
aught
else
than
cast
her
out
as
he
thought
of
this
he
felt
sure
that
she
had
betrayed
him
how
great
would
be
the
ignominy
to
him
should
he
be
driven
to
own
to
himself
that
she
had
not
betrayed
him
there
should
not
have
been
a
moment
he
said
to
himself
over
and
over
again
not
a
moment
yes
she
certainly
had
betrayed
him
there
might
still
be
safety
for
him
in
that
confident
assertion
of
not
a
moment
but
had
there
been
anything
of
that
conspiracy
of
which
he
had
certainly
at
first
judged
her
to
be
guilty
she
had
told
her
story
and
had
then
appealed
to
lady
mary
for
evidence
after
five
minutes
of
perfect
stillness
but
five
minutes
of
misery
five
minutes
during
which
great
beads
of
perspiration
broke
out
from
him
and
stood
upon
his
brow
he
had
to
confess
to
himself
that
he
did
not
want
any
evidence
he
did
believe
her
story
when
he
allowed
himself
to
think
she
had
been
in
league
with
tregear
he
had
wronged
her
he
wiped
away
the
beads
from
his
brow
and
again
repeated
to
himself
those
words
which
were
now
his
only
comfort
there
should
not
have
been
a
moment
not
a
moment
it
was
thus
and
only
thus
that
he
was
enabled
to
assure
himself
that
there
need
be
no
acknowledgment
of
wrong
done
on
his
part
having
settled
this
in
his
own
mind
he
forced
himself
to
attend
a
meeting
at
which
his
assistance
had
been
asked
as
to
a
complex
question
on
law
reform
the
duke
endeavoured
to
give
himself
up
entirely
to
the
matter
but
through
it
all
there
was
the
picture
before
him
of
finn
waiting
for
an
answer
to
her
letter
if
he
should
confirm
himself
in
his
opinion
that
he
had
been
right
then
would
any
answer
be
necessary
he
might
just
acknowledge
the
letter
after
the
fashion
which
has
come
up
in
official
life
than
which
silence
is
an
insult
much
more
bearable
but
he
did
not
wish
to
insult
nor
to
punish
her
further
he
would
willingly
have
withdrawn
the
punishment
under
which
she
was
groaning
could
he
have
done
so
without
or
he
might
write
as
she
had
done
advocating
his
own
cause
with
all
his
strength
using
that
last
one
strong
argument
there
should
not
have
been
a
moment
but
there
would
be
something
repulsive
to
his
personal
dignity
in
the
continued
correspondence
which
this
would
produce
the
duke
of
omnium
regrets
to
say
in
answer
to
finn
letter
that
he
thinks
no
good
can
be
attained
by
a
prolonged
correspondence
such
or
of
such
kind
he
thought
must
be
his
answer
but
would
this
be
a
fair
return
for
the
solicitude
shown
by
her
to
his
uncle
for
the
love
which
had
made
her
so
patient
a
friend
to
his
wife
for
the
nobility
of
her
own
conduct
in
many
things
then
his
mind
reverted
to
certain
jewels
supposed
to
be
of
enormous
value
which
were
still
in
his
possession
though
they
were
the
property
of
this
woman
they
had
been
left
to
her
by
his
uncle
and
she
had
obstinately
refused
to
take
them
now
they
were
lying
packed
in
the
cellars
of
certain
bankers
but
still
they
were
in
his
custody
what
should
he
now
do
in
this
matter
hitherto
perhaps
once
in
every
six
months
he
had
notified
to
her
that
he
was
keeping
them
as
her
curator
and
she
had
always
repeated
that
it
was
a
charge
from
which
she
could
not
relieve
him
it
had
become
almost
a
joke
between
them
but
how
could
he
joke
with
a
woman
with
whom
he
had
quarrelled
after
this
internecine
fashion
what
if
he
were
to
consult
lady
cantrip
he
could
not
do
so
without
a
pang
that
would
be
very
bitter
to
him
but
any
agony
would
be
better
than
that
arising
from
a
fear
that
he
had
been
unjust
to
one
who
had
deserved
well
of
him
no
doubt
lady
cantrip
would
see
it
in
the
same
light
as
he
had
done
and
then
he
would
be
able
to
support
himself
by
the
assurance
that
that
which
he
had
judged
to
be
right
was
approved
of
by
one
whom
the
world
would
acknowledge
to
be
a
good
judge
on
such
a
matter
when
he
got
home
he
found
his
son
letter
telling
him
of
the
election
at
silverbridge
there
was
something
in
it
which
softened
his
heart
to
the
young
man
or
perhaps
it
was
that
in
the
midst
of
his
many
discomforts
he
wished
to
find
something
which
at
least
was
not
painful
to
him
that
his
son
and
his
heir
should
insist
on
entering
political
life
in
opposition
to
him
was
of
course
a
source
of
pain
but
putting
that
aside
the
thing
had
been
done
pleasantly
enough
and
the
young
member
letter
had
been
written
with
some
good
feeling
so
he
answered
the
letter
as
pleasantly
as
he
knew
how
my
dear
silverbridge
i
am
glad
that
you
are
in
parliament
and
am
glad
also
that
you
should
have
been
returned
by
the
old
borough
though
i
would
that
you
could
have
reconciled
yourself
to
adhering
to
the
politics
of
your
family
but
there
is
nothing
disgraceful
in
such
a
change
and
i
am
able
to
congratulate
you
as
a
father
should
a
son
and
to
wish
you
long
life
and
success
as
a
legislator
there
are
one
or
two
things
i
would
ask
you
to
remember
and
firstly
this
that
as
you
have
voluntarily
undertaken
certain
duties
you
are
bound
as
an
honest
man
to
perform
them
as
scrupulously
as
though
you
were
paid
for
doing
them
there
was
no
obligation
in
you
to
seek
the
post
but
having
sought
it
and
acquired
it
you
can
not
neglect
the
work
attached
to
it
without
being
untrue
to
the
covenant
you
have
made
it
is
necessary
that
a
young
member
of
parliament
should
bear
this
in
his
mind
and
especially
a
member
who
has
not
worked
his
way
up
to
notoriety
outside
the
house
because
to
him
there
will
be
great
facility
for
idleness
and
neglect
and
then
i
would
have
you
always
remember
the
purport
for
which
there
is
a
parliament
elected
in
this
happy
and
free
country
it
is
not
that
some
men
may
shine
there
that
some
may
acquire
power
or
that
all
may
plume
themselves
on
being
the
elect
of
the
nation
it
often
appears
to
me
that
some
members
of
parliament
so
regard
their
success
in
life
as
the
fellows
of
our
colleges
do
too
often
thinking
that
their
fellowships
were
awarded
for
their
comfort
and
not
for
the
furtherance
of
any
object
as
education
or
religion
i
have
known
gentlemen
who
have
felt
that
in
becoming
members
of
parliament
they
had
achieved
an
object
for
themselves
instead
of
thinking
that
they
had
put
themselves
in
the
way
of
achieving
something
for
others
a
member
of
parliament
should
feel
himself
to
be
the
servant
of
his
country
and
like
every
other
servant
he
should
serve
if
this
be
distasteful
to
a
man
he
need
not
go
into
parliament
if
the
harness
gall
him
he
need
not
wear
it
but
if
he
takes
the
trappings
then
he
should
draw
the
coach
you
are
there
as
the
guardian
of
your
that
they
may
be
safe
that
they
may
be
prosperous
that
they
may
be
well
governed
and
lightly
burdened
above
all
that
they
may
be
free
if
you
can
not
feel
this
to
be
your
duty
you
should
not
be
there
at
all
and
i
would
have
you
remember
also
that
the
work
of
a
member
of
parliament
can
seldom
be
of
that
brilliant
nature
which
is
of
itself
charming
and
that
the
young
member
should
think
of
such
brilliancy
as
being
possible
to
him
only
at
a
distance
it
should
be
your
first
care
to
sit
and
listen
so
that
the
forms
and
methods
of
the
house
may
as
it
were
soak
into
you
gradually
and
then
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
speaking
in
the
house
is
but
a
very
small
part
of
a
member
work
perhaps
that
part
which
he
may
lay
aside
altogether
with
the
least
strain
on
his
conscience
a
good
member
of
parliament
will
be
good
upstairs
in
the
committee
rooms
good
to
make
and
to
keep
a
house
good
to
vote
for
his
party
if
it
may
be
nothing
better
but
for
the
measures
also
which
he
believes
to
be
for
the
good
of
his
country
gradually
if
you
will
give
your
thoughts
to
it
and
above
all
your
time
the
theory
of
legislation
will
sink
into
your
mind
and
you
will
find
that
there
will
come
upon
you
the
ineffable
delight
of
having
served
your
country
to
the
best
of
your
ability
it
is
the
only
pleasure
in
life
which
has
been
enjoyed
without
alloy
by
your
affectionate
father
omnium
the
duke
in
writing
this
letter
was
able
for
a
few
moments
to
forget
finn
and
to
enjoy
the
work
which
he
had
on
hand
chapter
xvi
poor
boy
the
new
member
for
silverbridge
when
he
entered
the
house
to
take
the
oath
was
supported
on
the
right
and
left
by
two
staunch
old
tories
monk
had
seen
him
a
few
minutes
previously
monk
who
of
all
liberals
was
the
firmest
and
than
whom
no
one
had
been
more
staunch
to
the
duke
and
had
congratulated
him
on
his
election
expressing
at
the
same
time
some
gentle
regrets
i
only
wish
you
could
have
come
among
us
on
the
other
side
he
said
but
i
could
said
the
young
lord
i
am
sure
nothing
but
a
conscientious
feeling
would
have
separated
you
from
your
father
friends
said
the
old
liberal
and
then
they
were
parted
and
the
member
for
silverbridge
was
bustled
up
to
the
table
between
two
staunch
tories
of
what
else
was
done
on
that
occasion
nothing
shall
be
said
here
no
political
work
was
required
from
him
except
that
of
helping
for
an
hour
or
two
to
crowd
the
government
benches
but
we
will
follow
him
as
he
left
the
house
there
were
one
or
two
others
quite
as
anxious
as
to
his
political
career
as
any
staunch
old
liberal
at
any
rate
one
other
he
had
promised
that
as
soon
as
he
could
get
away
from
the
house
he
would
go
to
belgrave
square
and
tell
lady
mabel
grex
all
about
it
when
he
reached
the
square
it
was
past
seven
but
lady
mabel
and
miss
cassewary
were
still
in
the
there
seemed
to
be
a
great
deal
of
bustle
and
i
did
understand
much
about
it
said
the
member
but
you
heard
the
speeches
these
were
the
speeches
made
on
the
proposing
and
seconding
of
the
address
oh
yes
lupton
did
it
very
well
lord
george
did
seem
to
be
quite
so
good
then
sir
timothy
beeswax
made
a
speech
and
then
monk
after
that
i
saw
other
fellows
going
away
so
i
bolted
too
if
i
were
a
member
of
parliament
i
would
never
leave
it
while
the
house
was
sitting
said
miss
cassewary
if
all
were
like
that
there
would
be
seats
for
them
to
sit
upon
said
silverbridge
a
persistent
member
will
always
find
a
seat
continued
the
positive
old
lady
i
am
sure
that
lord
silverbridge
means
to
do
his
duty
said
lady
mabel
oh
yes
i
thought
a
good
deal
about
it
and
i
mean
to
try
as
long
as
a
man
is
called
upon
to
speak
i
do
see
why
it
be
easy
enough
i
so
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
of
course
after
a
little
time
you
will
speak
i
should
so
like
to
hear
you
make
your
first
speech
if
i
thought
you
were
there
i
sure
i
should
not
make
it
at
all
just
at
this
period
miss
cassewary
saying
something
as
to
the
necessity
of
dressing
and
cautioning
her
young
friend
that
there
was
not
much
time
to
be
lost
left
the
room
dressing
does
not
take
me
more
than
ten
minutes
said
lady
mabel
miss
cassewary
declared
this
to
be
nonsense
but
she
nevertheless
left
the
room
whether
she
would
have
done
so
if
lord
silverbridge
had
not
been
lord
silverbridge
but
had
been
some
young
man
with
whom
it
would
not
have
been
expedient
that
lady
mabel
should
fall
in
love
may
perhaps
be
doubted
but
then
it
may
be
taken
as
certain
that
under
such
circumstances
lady
mabel
herself
would
not
have
remained
she
had
quite
realised
the
duties
of
life
had
had
her
little
romance
and
had
acknowledged
that
it
was
foolish
i
do
so
hope
that
you
will
do
well
she
said
going
back
to
the
parliamentary
duties
i
do
think
i
shall
ever
do
much
i
shall
never
be
like
my
father
i
do
see
why
not
there
never
was
anybody
like
him
i
am
always
amusing
myself
but
he
never
cared
for
amusement
you
are
very
young
as
far
as
i
can
learn
he
was
just
as
he
is
now
at
my
age
my
mother
has
told
me
that
long
before
she
married
him
he
used
to
spend
all
his
time
in
the
house
i
wonder
whether
you
would
mind
reading
the
letter
he
wrote
me
when
he
heard
of
my
election
then
he
took
the
epistle
out
of
his
pocket
and
handed
it
to
lady
mabel
he
means
all
that
he
says
he
always
does
that
and
he
really
hopes
that
you
will
put
your
shoulder
to
the
wheel
even
though
you
must
do
so
in
opposition
to
him
that
makes
no
difference
i
think
my
father
is
a
very
fine
fellow
shall
you
do
all
that
he
tells
you
well
i
suppose
not
except
that
he
advises
me
to
hold
my
tongue
i
think
that
i
shall
do
that
i
mean
to
go
down
there
you
know
and
i
daresay
i
shall
be
much
the
same
as
others
has
he
talked
to
you
much
about
it
no
he
never
talks
much
every
now
and
then
he
will
give
me
a
downright
lecture
or
he
will
write
me
a
letter
like
that
but
he
never
talks
to
any
of
us
how
very
odd
yes
he
is
odd
he
seems
to
be
fretful
when
we
are
with
him
a
good
many
things
make
him
unhappy
your
poor
mother
death
that
first
and
then
there
are
other
things
i
suppose
he
like
the
way
i
came
to
an
end
at
oxford
you
were
a
boy
then
of
course
i
was
very
sorry
for
it
though
i
hated
oxford
it
was
neither
one
thing
nor
another
you
were
your
own
master
and
yet
you
were
not
now
you
must
be
your
own
master
i
suppose
so
you
must
marry
and
become
a
lord
of
the
treasury
when
i
was
a
child
i
acted
as
a
child
you
know
all
about
that
oh
yes
and
now
i
must
throw
off
childish
things
you
mean
that
i
must
paint
any
man
house
eh
lady
mab
that
and
the
rest
of
it
you
are
a
legislator
now
so
is
popplecourt
who
took
his
seat
in
the
house
of
lords
two
or
three
months
ago
he
the
biggest
young
fool
i
know
out
he
even
paint
a
house
he
is
not
an
elected
legislator
it
makes
all
the
difference
i
quite
agree
with
what
the
duke
says
lord
popplecourt
ca
help
himself
whether
he
an
idle
young
scamp
or
not
he
must
be
a
legislator
but
when
a
man
goes
in
for
it
himself
as
you
have
done
he
should
make
up
his
mind
to
be
useful
i
shall
vote
with
my
party
of
course
more
than
that
much
more
than
that
if
you
did
care
for
politics
you
could
have
taken
a
line
of
your
own
when
she
said
this
she
knew
that
he
had
been
talked
into
what
he
had
done
by
tregear
by
tregear
who
had
ambition
and
intelligence
and
capacity
for
forming
an
opinion
of
his
own
if
you
do
not
do
it
for
your
own
sake
you
will
for
the
sake
of
those
who
who
who
are
your
friends
she
said
at
last
not
feeling
quite
able
to
tell
him
that
he
must
do
it
for
the
sake
of
those
who
loved
him
there
are
not
very
many
i
suppose
who
care
about
it
your
father
oh
yes
my
father
and
tregear
tregear
has
got
his
own
fish
to
fry
are
there
none
others
do
you
think
we
care
nothing
about
it
here
miss
cassewary
well
miss
cassewary
a
man
might
have
a
worse
friend
than
miss
cassewary
and
my
father
i
do
suppose
lord
grex
cares
a
straw
about
me
indeed
he
does
a
great
many
straws
and
so
do
i
do
you
think
i
do
care
a
straw
about
it
i
do
know
why
you
should
because
it
is
my
nature
to
be
earnest
a
girl
comes
out
into
the
world
so
young
that
she
becomes
serious
and
steady
as
it
were
so
much
sooner
than
a
man
does
i
always
think
that
nobody
is
so
full
of
chaff
as
you
are
lady
mab
i
am
not
chaffing
now
in
recommending
you
to
go
to
work
in
the
world
like
a
man
as
she
said
this
they
were
sitting
on
the
same
sofa
but
with
some
space
between
them
when
miss
cassewary
had
left
the
room
lord
silverbridge
was
standing
but
after
a
little
he
had
fallen
into
the
seat
at
the
extreme
corner
and
had
gradually
come
a
little
nearer
to
her
now
in
her
energy
she
put
out
her
hand
meaning
perhaps
to
touch
lightly
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
meaning
perhaps
not
quite
to
touch
him
at
all
but
as
she
did
so
he
put
out
his
hand
and
took
hold
of
hers
she
drew
it
away
not
seeming
to
allow
it
to
remain
in
his
grasp
for
a
moment
but
she
did
so
not
angrily
or
hurriedly
or
with
any
flurry
she
did
it
as
though
it
were
natural
that
he
should
take
her
hand
and
as
natural
that
she
should
recover
it
indeed
i
have
hardly
more
than
ten
minutes
left
for
dressing
she
said
rising
from
her
seat
if
you
will
say
that
you
care
about
it
you
yourself
i
will
do
my
best
as
he
made
this
declaration
blushes
covered
his
cheeks
and
forehead
i
do
care
about
it
very
much
i
myself
said
lady
mabel
not
blushing
at
all
then
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
lady
maid
putting
her
head
in
declared
that
my
lord
had
come
in
and
had
already
been
some
time
in
his
lord
silverbridge
she
said
quite
gaily
and
rather
more
aloud
than
would
have
been
necessary
had
she
not
intended
that
the
maid
also
should
hear
her
poor
boy
she
said
to
herself
as
she
was
dressing
poor
boy
then
when
the
evening
was
over
she
spoke
to
herself
again
about
him
dear
sweet
boy
and
then
she
sat
and
thought
how
was
it
that
she
was
so
old
a
woman
while
he
was
so
little
more
than
a
child
how
fair
he
was
how
far
removed
from
conceit
how
capable
of
being
made
into
a
man
in
the
process
of
time
what
might
not
be
expected
from
him
if
he
could
be
kept
in
good
hands
for
the
next
ten
years
but
in
whose
hands
what
would
she
be
in
ten
years
she
who
already
seemed
to
know
the
town
and
all
its
belongings
so
well
and
yet
she
was
as
young
in
years
as
he
he
as
she
knew
had
passed
his
birthday
and
so
had
she
that
was
all
it
might
be
good
for
her
that
she
should
marry
him
she
was
ambitious
and
such
a
marriage
would
satisfy
her
ambition
through
her
father
fault
and
her
brother
she
was
likely
to
be
poor
this
man
would
certainly
be
rich
many
of
those
who
were
buzzing
around
her
from
day
to
day
were
distasteful
to
her
from
among
them
she
knew
that
she
could
not
take
a
husband
let
their
rank
and
wealth
be
what
it
might
she
was
too
fastidious
too
proud
too
prone
to
think
that
things
should
be
with
her
as
she
liked
them
this
last
was
in
all
things
pleasant
to
her
though
he
was
but
a
boy
there
was
a
certain
boyish
manliness
about
him
the
very
way
in
which
he
had
grasped
at
her
hand
and
had
then
blushed
at
his
own
daring
had
gone
far
with
her
how
gracious
he
was
to
look
at
dear
sweet
boy
love
him
no
she
did
not
know
that
she
loved
him
that
dream
was
over
she
was
sure
however
that
she
liked
him
but
how
would
it
be
with
him
it
might
be
well
for
her
to
become
his
wife
but
could
it
be
well
for
him
that
he
should
become
her
husband
did
she
not
feel
that
it
would
be
better
for
him
that
he
should
become
a
man
before
he
married
at
all
perhaps
so
but
then
if
she
desisted
would
others
desist
if
she
did
not
put
out
her
bait
would
there
not
be
other
hooks
others
and
worse
would
not
such
a
one
so
soft
so
easy
so
prone
to
be
caught
and
so
desirable
for
the
catching
be
sure
to
be
made
prey
of
by
some
snare
but
could
she
love
him
that
a
woman
should
not
marry
a
man
without
loving
him
she
partly
knew
but
she
thought
she
knew
also
that
there
must
be
exceptions
she
would
do
her
very
best
to
love
him
that
other
man
should
be
banished
from
her
very
thoughts
she
would
be
such
a
wife
to
him
that
he
should
never
know
that
he
lacked
anything
poor
boy
sweet
dear
boy
he
as
he
went
away
to
his
dinner
had
his
thoughts
also
about
her
of
all
the
girls
he
knew
she
was
the
jolliest
and
of
all
his
friends
she
was
the
pleasantest
as
she
was
anxious
that
he
should
go
to
work
in
the
house
of
commons
he
would
go
to
work
there
as
for
loving
her
well
of
course
he
must
marry
someone
and
why
not
lady
mab
as
well
as
any
one
else
chapter
xvii
the
derby
an
attendance
at
the
newmarket
second
spring
meeting
had
unfortunately
not
been
compatible
with
the
silverbridge
election
major
tifto
had
therefore
been
obliged
to
look
after
the
affair
alone
a
very
useful
mare
as
tifto
had
been
in
the
habit
of
calling
a
leggy
thoroughbred
brute
named
coalition
was
on
this
occasion
confided
to
the
major
sole
care
and
judgment
but
coalition
failed
as
coalitions
always
do
and
tifto
had
to
report
to
his
noble
patron
that
they
had
not
pulled
off
the
event
it
had
been
a
match
for
four
hundred
pounds
made
indeed
by
lord
silverbridge
but
made
at
the
suggestion
of
tifto
and
now
tifto
wrote
in
a
very
bad
humour
about
it
it
had
been
altogether
his
lordship
fault
in
submitting
to
carry
two
pounds
more
than
tifto
had
thought
to
be
fair
and
equitable
the
match
had
been
lost
would
lord
silverbridge
be
so
good
as
to
pay
the
money
to
green
griffin
and
debit
him
tifto
with
the
share
of
his
loss
we
must
acknowledge
that
the
unpleasant
tone
of
the
major
letter
was
due
quite
as
much
to
the
he
had
received
in
reference
to
that
journey
to
silverbridge
as
to
the
loss
of
the
race
within
that
little
body
there
was
a
heart
and
that
heart
had
been
greatly
wounded
by
his
lordship
treatment
tifto
had
felt
himself
to
have
been
treated
like
a
servant
hardly
an
excuse
had
even
been
made
he
had
been
simply
told
that
he
was
not
wanted
he
was
apt
sometimes
to
tell
himself
that
he
knew
on
which
side
his
bread
was
buttered
but
perhaps
he
hardly
knew
how
best
to
keep
the
butter
going
there
was
a
little
pride
about
him
which
was
antagonistic
to
the
best
interests
of
such
a
trade
as
his
perhaps
it
was
well
that
he
should
inwardly
suffer
when
injured
but
it
could
not
be
well
that
he
should
declare
to
such
men
as
nidderdale
and
dolly
longstaff
and
popplecourt
that
he
did
mean
to
put
up
with
that
sort
of
thing
he
certainly
should
not
have
spoken
in
this
strain
before
tregear
of
all
men
living
he
hated
and
feared
him
the
most
and
he
knew
that
no
other
man
loved
silverbridge
as
did
tregear
had
he
been
thinking
of
his
instead
of
giving
way
to
the
mighty
anger
of
his
little
bosom
he
would
have
hardly
declared
openly
at
the
club
that
he
would
let
lord
silverbridge
know
that
he
did
not
mean
to
stand
any
man
airs
but
these
extravagances
were
due
perhaps
to
and
that
kind
of
intoxication
which
comes
to
certain
men
from
momentary
triumphs
tifto
could
always
be
got
to
make
a
fool
of
himself
when
surrounded
by
three
or
four
men
of
rank
who
for
the
occasion
would
talk
to
him
as
an
equal
he
almost
declared
that
coalition
had
lost
his
match
because
he
had
not
been
taken
down
to
silverbridge
tifto
is
in
a
deuce
of
a
way
with
you
said
dolly
longstaff
to
the
young
member
i
know
all
about
it
said
silverbridge
who
had
had
an
interview
with
his
partner
since
the
race
if
you
do
take
care
he
dismiss
you
silverbridge
did
not
care
much
about
this
knowing
that
words
of
wisdom
did
not
ordinarily
fall
from
the
mouth
of
dolly
longstaff
but
he
was
more
moved
when
his
friend
tregear
spoke
to
him
i
wish
you
knew
the
kind
of
things
that
fellow
tifto
says
behind
your
back
as
if
i
cared
but
you
ought
to
care
do
you
care
what
every
fellow
says
about
you
i
care
very
much
what
those
say
whom
i
choose
to
live
with
me
whatever
tifto
might
say
about
me
would
be
quite
indifferent
to
me
because
we
have
nothing
in
common
but
you
and
he
are
bound
together
we
have
a
horse
or
two
in
common
that
all
but
that
is
a
great
deal
the
truth
is
he
a
nasty
brawling
boasting
little
reptile
silverbridge
of
course
did
not
acknowledge
that
this
was
true
but
he
felt
it
and
almost
repented
of
his
trust
in
tifto
but
still
prime
minister
stood
very
well
for
the
derby
he
was
second
favourite
the
odds
against
him
being
only
four
to
one
the
glory
of
being
part
owner
of
a
probable
winner
of
the
derby
was
so
much
to
him
that
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
be
altogether
angry
with
tifto
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
horse
present
condition
was
due
entirely
to
tifto
care
tifto
spent
in
these
few
days
just
before
the
race
the
greatest
part
of
his
time
in
the
close
vicinity
of
the
horse
only
running
up
to
london
now
and
then
as
a
fish
comes
up
to
the
surface
for
a
breath
of
air
it
was
impossible
that
lord
silverbridge
should
separate
himself
from
the
major
at
any
rate
till
after
the
epsom
meeting
he
had
paid
the
money
for
the
match
without
a
word
of
reproach
to
his
partner
but
still
with
a
feeling
that
things
were
not
quite
as
they
ought
to
be
in
money
matters
his
father
had
been
liberal
but
not
very
definite
he
had
been
told
that
he
ought
not
to
spend
above
two
thousand
pounds
a
year
and
had
been
reminded
that
there
was
a
house
for
him
to
use
both
in
town
and
in
the
country
but
he
had
been
given
to
understand
also
that
any
application
made
to
morton
if
not
very
unreasonable
would
be
attended
with
success
a
solemn
promise
had
been
exacted
from
him
that
he
would
have
no
dealings
with
and
then
he
had
been
set
afloat
there
had
been
a
rather
frequent
correspondence
with
morton
who
had
once
or
twice
submitted
a
total
of
the
money
paid
on
behalf
of
his
correspondent
lord
silverbridge
who
imagined
himself
to
be
anything
but
extravagant
had
wondered
how
the
figures
could
mount
up
so
rapidly
but
the
money
needed
was
always
forthcoming
and
the
raising
of
objections
never
seemed
to
be
carried
back
beyond
morton
his
promise
to
his
father
about
the
had
been
scrupulously
kept
as
long
as
ready
money
can
be
made
to
be
forthcoming
without
any
charge
for
interest
a
young
man
must
be
very
foolish
who
will
prefer
to
borrow
it
at
per
cent
now
had
come
the
night
before
the
derby
and
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
the
young
lord
was
much
fluttered
by
the
greatness
of
the
coming
struggle
tifto
having
seen
his
horse
conveyed
to
epsom
had
come
up
to
london
in
order
that
he
might
dine
with
his
partner
and
hear
what
was
being
said
about
the
race
at
the
beargarden
the
party
dining
there
consisted
of
silverbridge
dolly
longstaff
popplecourt
and
tifto
nidderdale
was
to
have
joined
them
but
he
told
them
on
the
day
before
with
a
sigh
that
domestic
duties
were
too
strong
for
him
lady
nidderdale
or
if
not
lady
nidderdale
herself
then
lady
nidderdale
mother
was
so
far
potent
over
the
young
nobleman
as
to
induce
him
to
confine
his
derby
jovialities
to
the
derby
day
another
guest
had
also
been
expected
the
reason
for
whose
must
be
explained
somewhat
at
length
lord
gerald
palliser
the
duke
second
son
was
at
this
time
at
cambridge
being
almost
as
popular
at
trinity
as
his
brother
had
been
at
christ
church
it
was
to
him
quite
a
matter
of
course
that
he
should
see
his
horse
run
for
the
derby
but
unfortunately
in
this
very
year
a
stand
was
being
made
by
the
university
pundits
against
a
practice
which
they
thought
had
become
too
general
for
the
last
year
or
two
it
had
been
considered
almost
as
much
a
matter
of
course
that
a
cambridge
undergraduate
should
go
to
the
derby
as
that
a
member
of
parliament
should
do
so
against
this
three
or
four
rigid
disciplinarians
had
raised
their
voices
and
as
a
result
no
young
man
up
at
trinity
could
get
leave
to
be
away
on
the
derby
pretext
lord
gerald
raged
against
the
restriction
very
loudly
he
at
first
proclaimed
his
intention
of
ignoring
the
college
authorities
altogether
of
course
he
would
be
expelled
but
the
order
itself
was
to
his
thinking
so
absurd
the
idea
that
he
should
not
see
his
brother
horse
run
was
so
extravagant
that
he
argued
that
his
father
could
not
be
angry
with
him
for
incurring
dismissal
in
so
excellent
a
cause
but
his
brother
saw
things
in
a
different
light
he
knew
how
his
father
had
looked
at
him
when
he
had
been
sent
away
from
oxford
and
he
counselled
moderation
gerald
should
see
the
derby
but
should
not
encounter
that
heaviest
wrath
of
all
which
comes
from
a
man
not
sleeping
beneath
his
college
roof
there
was
a
train
which
left
cambridge
at
an
early
hour
and
would
bring
him
into
london
in
time
to
accompany
his
friends
to
the
and
another
train
a
special
which
would
take
him
down
after
dinner
so
that
he
and
others
should
reach
cambridge
before
the
college
gates
were
shut
the
dinner
at
the
beargarden
was
very
joyous
of
course
the
state
of
the
betting
in
regard
to
prime
minister
was
the
subject
generally
popular
for
the
night
lupton
came
in
a
gentleman
well
known
in
all
fashionable
circles
parliamentary
social
and
racing
who
was
rather
older
than
his
company
on
this
occasion
but
still
not
so
much
so
as
to
be
found
to
be
an
incumbrance
lord
glasslough
too
and
others
joined
them
and
a
good
deal
was
said
about
the
horse
i
never
keep
these
things
dark
said
tifto
of
course
he
an
uncertain
horse
most
horses
are
said
lupton
just
so
lupton
what
i
mean
is
the
minister
has
got
a
bit
of
temper
but
if
he
likes
to
do
his
best
i
do
think
any
in
england
can
get
his
nose
past
him
for
half
a
mile
he
be
nowhere
with
the
provence
filly
said
glasslough
i
speaking
of
a
derby
distance
my
lord
that
a
kind
of
thing
nobody
really
knows
said
lupton
i
seen
him
his
gallops
said
the
little
man
who
in
his
moments
of
excitement
would
sometimes
fall
away
from
that
exact
pronunciation
which
had
been
one
of
the
studies
of
his
life
and
have
measured
his
stride
i
think
i
know
what
pace
means
of
course
i
not
going
to
answer
for
the
he
a
temper
but
if
things
go
favourably
no
animal
that
ever
showed
on
the
downs
was
more
likely
to
do
the
trick
is
there
any
gentleman
here
who
would
like
to
bet
me
fifteen
to
one
in
hundreds
against
the
two
events
the
derby
and
the
leger
the
desired
odds
were
at
once
offered
by
lupton
and
the
bet
was
booked
this
gave
rise
to
other
betting
and
before
the
evening
was
over
lord
silverbridge
had
taken
to
one
against
his
horse
to
such
an
extent
that
he
stood
to
lose
twelve
hundred
pounds
the
champagne
which
he
had
drunk
and
the
news
that
quousque
the
first
favourite
had
so
gone
to
pieces
that
now
there
was
a
question
which
was
the
first
favourite
had
so
inflated
him
that
had
he
been
left
alone
he
would
almost
have
wagered
even
money
on
his
horse
in
the
midst
of
his
excitement
there
came
to
him
a
feeling
that
he
was
allowing
himself
to
do
just
that
which
he
had
intended
to
avoid
but
then
the
occasion
was
so
peculiar
how
often
can
it
happen
to
a
man
in
his
life
that
he
shall
own
a
favourite
for
the
derby
the
affair
was
one
in
which
it
was
almost
necessary
that
he
should
risk
a
little
money
tifto
when
he
got
into
his
bed
was
altogether
happy
he
had
added
to
his
champagne
and
feared
nothing
if
prime
minister
should
win
the
derby
he
would
be
able
to
pay
all
that
he
owed
and
to
make
a
start
with
money
in
his
pocket
and
then
there
would
be
attached
to
him
all
the
infinite
glory
of
being
the
owner
of
a
winner
of
the
derby
the
horse
was
run
in
his
name
thoughts
as
to
great
successes
crowded
themselves
upon
his
heated
brain
what
might
not
be
open
to
him
parliament
the
jockey
club
the
mastership
of
one
of
the
crack
shire
packs
might
it
not
come
to
pass
that
he
should
some
day
become
the
great
authority
in
england
upon
races
racehorses
and
hunters
if
he
could
be
the
winner
of
a
derby
and
leger
he
thought
that
glasslough
and
lupton
would
snub
him
no
longer
that
even
tregear
would
speak
to
him
and
that
his
pal
the
duke
son
would
never
throw
him
aside
again
lord
silverbridge
had
bought
a
drag
with
all
its
appendages
there
was
a
coach
the
four
bay
horses
the
harness
and
the
two
regulation
grooms
when
making
this
purchase
he
had
condescended
to
say
a
word
to
his
father
on
the
subject
everybody
belongs
to
the
club
now
said
the
son
i
never
did
said
the
duke
ah
if
i
could
be
like
you
the
duke
had
said
that
he
would
think
about
it
and
then
had
told
morton
that
he
was
to
pay
the
bill
for
this
new
toy
he
had
thought
about
it
and
had
assured
himself
that
driving
a
coach
and
four
was
at
present
regarded
as
a
fitting
amusement
for
young
men
of
rank
and
wealth
he
did
not
understand
it
himself
it
seemed
to
him
to
be
as
unnatural
as
though
a
gentleman
should
turn
blacksmith
and
make
horseshoes
for
his
amusement
driving
four
horses
was
hard
work
but
the
same
might
be
said
of
rowing
there
were
men
he
knew
who
would
spend
their
days
standing
at
a
lathe
making
little
boxes
for
their
recreation
he
did
not
sympathise
with
it
but
the
fact
was
so
and
this
driving
of
coaches
was
regarded
with
favour
he
had
been
a
little
touched
by
that
word
his
son
had
spoken
ah
if
i
could
be
like
you
so
he
had
given
the
permission
the
drag
horses
harness
and
grooms
had
come
into
the
possession
of
lord
silverbridge
and
now
they
were
put
into
requisition
to
take
their
triumphant
owner
and
his
party
down
to
epsom
dolly
longstaff
team
was
sent
down
to
meet
them
gerald
palliser
who
had
come
up
from
cambridge
that
morning
was
allowed
to
drive
the
first
stage
out
of
town
to
compensate
him
for
the
cruelty
done
to
him
by
the
university
pundits
tifto
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
with
a
white
hat
and
a
blue
veil
and
a
new
coat
was
by
no
means
the
least
happy
of
the
party
how
that
race
was
run
and
how
both
prime
minister
and
quousque
were
beaten
by
an
outsider
named
fishknife
prime
minister
however
coming
in
a
good
second
the
present
writer
having
no
aptitude
in
that
way
can
not
describe
such
however
were
the
facts
and
then
dolly
longstaff
and
lord
silverbridge
drove
the
coach
back
to
london
the
coming
back
was
not
so
triumphant
though
the
young
fellows
bore
their
failure
well
dolly
longstaff
had
lost
a
pot
of
money
silverbridge
would
have
to
draw
upon
that
inexhaustible
morton
for
something
over
two
thousand
pounds
in
regard
to
which
he
had
no
doubt
as
to
the
certainty
with
which
the
money
would
be
forthcoming
but
he
feared
that
it
would
give
rise
to
special
notice
from
his
father
even
the
poor
younger
brother
had
lost
a
couple
of
hundred
pounds
for
which
he
would
have
to
make
his
own
special
application
to
morton
but
tifto
felt
it
more
than
any
one
the
horse
ought
to
have
won
fishknife
had
been
favoured
by
such
a
series
of
accidents
that
the
whole
affair
had
been
a
miracle
tifto
had
these
circumstances
at
his
fingers
ends
and
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
and
evening
explained
them
accurately
to
all
who
would
listen
to
him
he
had
this
to
say
on
his
own
behalf
that
before
the
party
had
left
the
course
their
horse
stood
first
favourite
for
the
leger
but
tifto
was
unhappy
as
he
came
back
to
town
and
in
spite
of
the
lunch
which
had
been
very
glorious
sat
moody
and
sometimes
even
silent
within
his
gay
apparel
it
was
the
unfairest
start
i
ever
saw
said
tifto
almost
getting
up
from
his
seat
on
the
coach
so
as
to
address
dolly
and
silverbridge
on
the
box
what
the
is
the
good
of
that
said
dolly
from
the
take
your
licking
and
do
squeal
that
all
very
well
i
can
take
my
licking
as
well
as
another
man
but
one
has
to
look
to
the
causes
of
these
things
i
never
saw
peppermint
ride
so
badly
before
he
got
round
the
corner
i
wished
been
on
the
horse
myself
i
do
believe
it
was
peppermint
fault
a
bit
said
silverbridge
well
perhaps
not
only
i
did
think
that
i
was
a
pretty
good
judge
of
riding
then
tifto
again
settled
down
into
silence
but
though
much
money
had
been
lost
and
a
great
deal
of
disappointment
had
to
be
endured
by
our
party
in
reference
to
the
derby
the
most
injurious
and
most
deplorable
event
in
the
history
had
not
occurred
yet
dinner
had
been
ordered
at
the
beargarden
at
seven
an
hour
earlier
than
would
have
been
named
had
it
not
been
that
lord
gerald
must
be
at
the
eastern
counties
railway
station
at
nine
an
hour
and
a
half
for
dinner
and
a
cigar
afterwards
and
half
an
hour
to
get
to
the
railway
station
would
not
be
more
than
time
enough
but
of
all
men
alive
dolly
longstaff
was
the
most
unpunctual
he
did
not
arrive
till
eight
the
others
were
not
there
before
seven
and
it
was
nearly
eight
before
any
of
them
sat
down
at
eight
silverbridge
began
to
be
very
anxious
about
his
brother
and
told
him
that
he
ought
to
start
without
further
delay
a
hansom
cab
was
waiting
at
the
door
but
lord
gerald
still
delayed
he
knew
he
said
that
the
special
would
not
start
till
nine
there
were
a
lot
of
fellows
who
were
dining
about
everywhere
and
they
would
never
get
to
the
station
by
the
hour
fixed
it
became
apparent
to
the
elder
brother
that
gerald
would
stay
altogether
unless
he
were
forced
to
go
and
at
last
he
did
get
up
and
pushed
the
young
fellow
out
drive
like
the
very
devil
he
said
to
the
cabman
explaining
to
him
something
of
the
circumstances
the
cabman
did
do
his
best
but
a
cab
can
not
be
made
to
travel
from
the
beargarden
which
as
all
the
world
knows
is
close
to
james
street
to
liverpool
street
in
the
city
in
ten
minutes
when
lord
gerald
reached
the
station
the
train
had
started
at
twenty
minutes
to
ten
the
young
man
reappeared
at
the
club
why
on
earth
did
you
take
a
special
for
yourself
exclaimed
silverbridge
they
would
give
me
one
after
that
it
was
apparent
to
all
of
them
that
what
had
just
happened
had
done
more
to
ruffle
our
temper
than
his
failure
and
loss
at
the
races
i
would
have
had
it
happen
for
any
money
you
could
name
said
the
elder
brother
to
the
younger
as
he
took
him
home
to
carlton
terrace
if
they
do
send
me
down
what
the
odds
said
the
younger
brother
who
was
not
quite
as
sober
as
he
might
have
been
after
what
happened
to
me
it
will
almost
break
the
heart
said
the
heir
chapter
xviii
one
of
the
results
of
the
derby
on
the
following
morning
at
about
eleven
silverbridge
and
his
brother
were
at
breakfast
at
an
hotel
in
jermyn
street
they
had
slept
in
carlton
terrace
but
lord
gerald
had
done
so
without
the
knowledge
of
the
duke
lord
silverbridge
as
he
was
putting
himself
to
bed
had
made
up
his
mind
to
tell
the
story
to
the
duke
at
once
but
when
the
morning
came
his
courage
failed
him
the
two
young
men
therefore
slunk
out
of
the
house
and
as
there
was
no
breakfasting
at
the
beargarden
they
went
to
this
hotel
they
were
both
rather
gloomy
but
the
elder
brother
was
the
more
sad
of
the
two
i
give
anything
i
have
in
the
world
he
said
that
you
had
come
up
at
all
things
have
been
so
unfortunate
why
the
deuce
would
you
go
when
i
told
you
who
on
earth
would
have
thought
that
they
have
been
so
punctual
they
never
are
punctual
on
the
great
eastern
it
was
an
infernal
shame
i
think
i
shall
go
at
once
to
harnage
and
tell
him
all
about
it
harnage
was
lord
gerald
tutor
but
you
been
in
ever
so
many
rows
before
well
i
been
gated
and
once
when
they
gated
me
i
came
right
upon
harnage
on
the
bridge
at
king
what
sort
of
a
fellow
is
he
he
used
to
be
now
he
has
taken
ever
so
many
crotchets
into
his
head
it
was
he
who
began
all
this
about
none
of
the
men
going
to
the
derby
did
you
ask
him
yourself
for
leave
yes
and
when
i
told
him
about
your
owning
prime
minister
he
got
savage
and
declared
that
was
the
very
reason
why
i
should
go
you
did
tell
me
that
i
was
determined
i
would
go
i
was
going
to
be
made
a
child
of
at
last
it
was
decided
that
the
two
brothers
should
go
down
to
cambridge
together
silverbridge
would
be
able
to
come
back
to
london
the
same
evening
so
as
to
take
his
drag
down
to
the
oaks
on
the
friday
a
duty
from
which
even
his
present
misery
would
not
deter
him
they
reached
cambridge
at
about
three
and
lord
silverbridge
at
once
called
at
the
master
lodge
and
sent
in
his
card
the
master
of
trinity
is
so
great
that
he
can
not
be
supposed
to
see
all
comers
but
on
this
occasion
lord
silverbridge
was
fortunate
with
much
trepidation
he
told
his
story
such
being
the
circumstances
could
anything
be
done
to
moderate
the
vials
of
wrath
which
must
doubtless
be
poured
out
over
the
head
of
his
unfortunate
brother
why
come
to
me
said
the
master
from
what
you
say
yourself
it
is
evident
that
you
know
that
this
must
rest
with
the
college
tutor
i
thought
sir
if
you
would
say
a
word
do
you
think
it
would
be
right
that
i
should
interfere
for
one
special
man
and
that
a
man
of
special
rank
nobody
thinks
that
would
count
for
anything
but
but
what
asked
the
master
if
you
knew
my
father
sir
everybody
knows
your
father
every
englishman
i
mean
of
course
i
know
your
father
as
a
public
man
and
i
know
how
much
the
country
owes
to
him
yes
it
does
but
it
is
not
that
i
mean
if
you
knew
how
this
would
would
would
break
his
heart
then
there
came
a
tear
into
the
young
man
eye
and
there
was
something
almost
like
a
tear
in
the
eye
of
the
old
man
too
of
course
it
was
my
fault
i
got
him
to
come
he
had
the
slightest
intention
of
staying
i
think
you
will
believe
what
i
say
about
that
sir
i
believe
every
word
you
say
my
lord
i
got
into
a
row
at
oxford
i
daresay
you
heard
there
never
was
anything
so
stupid
that
was
a
great
grief
to
my
father
a
very
great
grief
it
is
so
hard
upon
him
because
he
never
did
anything
foolish
himself
you
should
try
to
imitate
him
silverbridge
shook
his
head
or
at
least
not
to
grieve
him
that
is
it
he
has
got
over
the
affair
about
me
as
i
the
eldest
son
i
got
into
parliament
and
he
thinks
perhaps
that
all
has
been
forgotten
an
eldest
son
may
i
fancy
be
a
greater
ass
than
his
younger
brother
the
master
could
not
but
smile
as
he
thought
of
the
selection
which
had
been
made
of
a
legislator
but
if
gerald
is
sent
down
i
do
know
how
he
get
over
it
and
now
the
tears
absolutely
rolled
down
the
young
man
face
so
that
he
was
forced
to
wipe
them
from
his
eyes
the
master
was
much
moved
that
a
young
man
should
pray
for
himself
would
be
nothing
to
him
the
discipline
of
the
college
was
not
in
his
hands
and
such
prayers
would
avail
nothing
with
him
nor
would
a
brother
praying
simply
for
a
brother
avail
much
a
father
asking
for
his
son
might
be
resisted
but
the
brother
asking
pardon
for
the
brother
on
behalf
of
the
father
was
almost
irresistible
but
this
man
had
long
been
in
a
position
in
which
he
knew
that
no
such
prayers
should
ever
prevail
at
all
in
the
first
place
it
was
not
his
business
if
he
did
anything
it
would
only
be
by
asking
a
favour
when
he
knew
that
no
favour
should
be
granted
and
a
favour
which
he
of
all
men
should
not
ask
because
to
him
of
all
men
it
could
not
be
refused
and
then
the
very
altitude
of
the
great
statesman
whom
he
was
invited
to
befriend
the
position
of
this
duke
who
had
been
so
powerful
and
might
be
powerful
again
was
against
any
such
interference
of
himself
he
might
be
sure
that
he
would
certainly
have
done
this
as
readily
for
any
jones
as
for
the
duke
of
omnium
but
were
he
to
do
it
it
would
be
said
of
him
that
it
had
been
done
because
the
man
was
duke
of
omnium
there
are
positions
exalted
beyond
the
reach
of
benevolence
because
benevolence
would
seem
to
be
your
father
if
he
were
here
said
he
would
know
that
i
could
not
interfere
and
will
he
be
sent
down
i
do
not
know
all
the
circumstances
from
your
own
showing
the
case
seems
to
be
one
of
great
insubordination
to
tell
the
truth
lord
silverbridge
i
ought
not
to
have
spoken
to
you
on
the
subject
at
all
you
mean
that
i
should
not
have
spoken
to
you
well
i
did
not
say
so
and
if
you
have
been
indiscreet
i
can
pardon
that
i
wish
i
could
have
served
you
but
i
fear
that
it
is
not
in
my
power
then
lord
silverbridge
took
his
leave
and
going
to
his
brother
rooms
waited
there
till
lord
gerald
had
returned
from
his
interview
with
the
tutor
it
all
up
said
he
chucking
down
his
cap
striving
to
be
at
his
ease
i
may
pack
up
and
go
just
where
i
please
he
says
that
on
no
account
will
he
have
anything
more
to
do
with
me
i
asked
him
what
i
was
to
do
and
he
said
that
the
governor
had
better
take
my
name
off
the
books
of
the
college
i
did
ask
whether
i
could
go
over
to
maclean
who
is
maclean
one
of
the
other
tutors
but
the
brute
only
smiled
he
thought
you
meant
it
for
chaff
well
i
suppose
i
did
mean
to
show
him
that
i
was
not
going
to
be
exterminated
by
him
he
will
write
to
the
governor
and
you
will
have
to
talk
to
the
governor
yes
as
lord
silverbridge
went
back
that
afternoon
to
london
he
thought
very
much
of
that
talking
to
the
governor
never
yet
had
he
been
able
to
say
anything
very
pleasant
to
the
governor
he
had
himself
been
always
in
disgrace
at
eton
and
had
been
sent
away
from
oxford
he
had
introduced
tregear
into
the
family
which
of
all
the
troubles
perhaps
was
the
worst
he
had
changed
his
politics
he
had
spent
more
money
than
he
ought
to
have
done
and
now
at
this
very
moment
must
ask
for
a
large
sum
and
he
had
brought
gerald
up
to
see
the
derby
thereby
causing
him
to
be
sent
away
from
cambridge
and
through
it
all
there
was
present
to
him
a
feeling
that
by
no
words
which
he
could
use
would
he
be
able
to
make
his
father
understand
how
deeply
he
felt
all
this
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
see
the
duke
that
evening
and
the
next
morning
he
was
sent
for
before
he
was
out
of
bed
he
found
his
father
at
breakfast
with
the
tutor
letter
before
him
do
you
know
anything
about
this
asked
the
duke
very
calmly
gerald
ran
up
to
see
the
derby
and
in
the
evening
missed
the
train
harnage
tells
me
that
he
had
been
expressly
ordered
not
to
go
to
these
races
i
suppose
he
was
sir
then
there
was
silence
between
them
for
some
minutes
you
might
as
well
sit
down
and
eat
your
breakfast
said
the
father
then
lord
silverbridge
did
sit
down
and
poured
himself
out
a
cup
of
tea
there
was
no
servant
in
the
room
and
he
dreaded
to
ring
the
bell
is
there
anything
you
want
asked
the
duke
there
was
a
small
dish
of
fried
bacon
on
the
table
and
some
cold
mutton
on
the
sideboard
silverbridge
declaring
that
he
had
everything
that
was
necessary
got
up
and
helped
himself
to
the
cold
mutton
then
again
there
was
silence
during
which
the
duke
crunched
his
toast
and
made
an
attempt
at
reading
the
newspaper
but
soon
pushing
that
aside
he
again
took
up
harnage
letter
silverbridge
watched
every
motion
of
his
father
as
he
slowly
made
his
way
through
the
slice
of
cold
mutton
it
seems
that
gerald
is
to
be
sent
away
altogether
i
fear
so
sir
he
has
profited
by
your
example
at
oxford
did
you
persuade
him
to
come
to
these
races
i
am
afraid
i
did
though
you
knew
the
orders
which
had
been
given
i
thought
it
was
meant
that
he
should
not
be
away
the
night
he
had
asked
permission
to
go
to
the
derby
and
had
been
positively
refused
did
you
know
that
silverbridge
sat
for
some
moments
considering
he
could
not
at
first
quite
remember
what
he
had
known
and
what
he
had
not
known
perhaps
he
entertained
some
faint
hope
that
the
question
would
be
allowed
to
pass
unanswered
he
saw
however
from
his
father
eye
that
that
was
impossible
and
then
he
did
remember
it
all
i
suppose
i
did
know
it
and
you
were
willing
to
imperil
your
brother
position
in
life
and
my
happiness
in
order
that
he
might
see
a
horse
of
which
i
believe
you
call
yourself
part
owner
run
a
race
i
thought
there
would
be
no
risk
if
he
got
back
the
same
night
i
do
suppose
there
is
any
good
in
my
saying
it
but
i
never
was
so
sorry
for
anything
in
all
my
life
i
feel
as
if
i
could
go
and
hang
myself
that
is
absurd
and
unmanly
said
the
duke
the
expression
of
sorrow
as
it
had
been
made
might
be
absurd
and
unmanly
but
nevertheless
it
had
touched
him
he
was
severe
because
he
did
not
know
how
far
his
severity
wounded
it
is
a
great
blow
another
great
blow
races
a
congregation
of
all
the
worst
blackguards
in
the
country
mixed
with
the
greatest
fools
lord
cantrip
was
there
said
silverbridge
and
i
saw
sir
timothy
beeswax
if
the
presence
of
sir
timothy
be
an
allurement
to
you
i
pity
you
indeed
i
have
nothing
further
to
say
about
it
you
have
ruined
your
brother
he
had
been
driven
to
further
anger
by
this
reference
to
one
man
whom
he
respected
and
to
another
whom
he
despised
do
say
that
sir
what
am
i
to
say
let
him
be
an
attaché
or
something
of
that
sort
do
you
believe
it
possible
that
he
should
pass
any
examination
i
think
that
my
children
between
them
will
bring
me
to
the
grave
you
had
better
go
now
i
suppose
you
will
want
to
be
at
the
races
again
then
the
young
man
crept
out
of
the
room
and
going
to
his
own
part
of
the
house
shut
himself
up
alone
for
nearly
an
hour
what
had
he
better
do
to
give
his
father
some
comfort
should
he
abandon
racing
altogether
sell
his
share
of
prime
minister
and
coalition
and
go
in
hard
and
strong
for
committees
debates
and
divisions
should
he
get
rid
of
his
drag
and
resolve
to
read
up
parliamentary
literature
he
was
resolved
upon
one
thing
at
any
rate
he
would
not
go
to
the
oaks
that
day
and
then
he
was
resolved
on
another
thing
he
would
call
on
lady
mab
grex
and
ask
her
advice
he
felt
so
disconsolate
and
insufficient
for
himself
that
he
wanted
advice
from
someone
whom
he
could
trust
he
found
tifto
dolly
longstaff
and
one
or
two
others
at
the
stables
from
whence
it
was
intended
that
the
drag
should
start
they
were
waiting
and
rather
angry
because
they
had
been
kept
waiting
but
the
news
when
it
came
was
very
sad
indeed
you
would
mind
taking
the
team
down
and
back
yourself
would
you
dolly
he
said
to
longstaff
you
are
going
said
dolly
assuming
a
look
of
much
heroic
horror
no
i
am
not
going
what
up
asked
popplecourt
that
rather
sudden
is
it
asked
the
major
well
yes
i
suppose
it
is
sudden
it
throwing
us
over
a
little
is
it
not
that
i
see
you
got
the
trap
and
the
horses
yes
we
got
the
trap
and
the
horses
said
dolly
and
i
vote
we
make
a
start
as
you
are
not
going
yourself
perhaps
i
better
drive
your
horses
said
tifto
dolly
will
take
the
team
said
his
lordship
yes
decidedly
i
will
take
the
team
said
dolly
there
is
a
deal
of
driving
wanted
on
the
road
to
epsom
but
a
man
should
know
how
to
hold
his
reins
this
of
course
gave
rise
to
some
angry
words
but
silverbridge
did
not
stop
to
hear
them
the
poor
duke
had
no
one
to
whom
he
could
go
for
advice
and
consolation
when
his
son
left
him
he
turned
to
his
newspaper
and
tried
to
read
it
in
vain
his
mind
was
too
ill
at
ease
to
admit
of
political
matters
he
was
greatly
grieved
by
this
new
misfortune
as
to
gerald
and
by
lord
silverbridge
propensity
to
racing
but
though
these
sorrows
were
heavy
there
was
a
sorrow
heavier
than
these
lady
cantrip
had
expressed
an
opinion
almost
in
favour
of
tregear
and
had
certainly
expressed
an
opinion
in
favour
of
finn
the
whole
affair
in
regard
to
finn
had
been
explained
to
her
and
she
had
told
the
duke
that
according
to
her
thinking
finn
had
behaved
well
when
the
duke
with
an
energy
which
was
by
no
means
customary
with
him
had
asked
that
question
on
the
answer
to
which
so
much
depended
should
there
have
been
a
moment
lost
lady
cantrip
had
assured
him
that
not
a
moment
had
been
lost
finn
had
at
once
gone
to
work
and
had
arranged
that
the
whole
affair
should
be
told
to
him
the
duke
in
the
proper
way
i
think
she
did
said
lady
cantrip
what
i
myself
should
have
done
in
similar
circumstances
if
lady
cantrip
was
right
then
must
his
apology
to
finn
be
ample
and
abject
perhaps
it
was
this
feeling
which
at
the
moment
was
most
vexatious
to
him
chapter
xix
no
my
lord
i
do
not
between
two
and
three
lord
silverbridge
in
spite
of
his
sorrow
found
himself
able
to
eat
his
lunch
at
his
club
the
place
was
deserted
the
beargarden
world
having
gone
to
the
races
as
he
sat
eating
cold
lamb
and
drinking
he
did
confirm
himself
in
certain
modified
resolutions
which
might
be
more
probably
kept
than
those
sterner
laws
of
absolute
renunciation
to
which
he
had
thought
of
pledging
himself
in
his
morning
condition
his
father
had
spoken
in
very
strong
language
against
racing
saying
that
those
who
went
were
either
fools
or
rascals
he
was
sure
that
this
was
exaggerated
half
the
house
of
lords
and
of
the
house
of
commons
were
to
be
seen
at
the
derby
but
no
doubt
there
were
many
rascals
and
fools
and
he
could
not
associate
with
the
legislators
without
finding
himself
among
the
fools
and
rascals
he
would
as
soon
as
he
could
separate
himself
from
the
major
and
he
would
not
bet
it
was
on
that
side
of
the
sport
that
the
rascals
and
the
fools
showed
themselves
of
what
service
could
betting
be
to
him
whom
providence
had
provided
with
all
things
wanted
to
make
life
pleasant
as
to
the
drag
his
father
had
in
a
certain
measure
approved
of
that
and
he
would
keep
the
drag
as
he
must
have
some
relaxation
but
his
great
effort
of
all
should
be
made
in
the
house
of
commons
he
would
endeavour
to
make
his
father
perceive
that
he
had
appreciated
that
letter
he
would
always
be
in
the
house
soon
after
four
and
would
remain
there
for
if
possible
as
long
as
the
speaker
sat
in
the
chair
he
had
already
begun
to
feel
that
there
was
a
difficulty
in
keeping
his
seat
upon
those
benches
the
there
would
be
so
much
longer
than
elsewhere
an
irresistible
desire
of
sauntering
out
would
come
upon
him
there
were
men
the
very
sound
of
whose
voices
was
already
odious
to
him
there
had
come
upon
him
a
feeling
in
regard
to
certain
orators
that
when
once
they
had
begun
there
was
no
reason
why
they
should
ever
stop
words
of
some
sort
were
always
forthcoming
like
spiders
webs
he
did
not
think
that
he
could
learn
to
take
a
pleasure
in
sitting
in
the
house
but
he
hoped
that
he
might
be
man
enough
to
do
it
though
it
was
not
pleasant
he
would
begin
instead
of
going
to
the
oaks
but
before
he
went
to
the
house
he
would
see
lady
mabel
grex
and
here
it
may
be
well
to
state
that
in
making
his
resolutions
as
to
a
better
life
he
had
considered
much
whether
it
would
not
be
well
for
him
to
take
a
wife
his
father
had
once
told
him
that
when
he
married
the
house
in
carlton
terrace
should
be
his
own
i
will
be
a
lodger
if
you
will
have
me
said
the
duke
or
if
your
wife
should
not
like
that
i
will
find
a
lodging
elsewhere
this
had
been
in
the
sadness
and
tenderness
which
had
immediately
followed
the
death
of
the
duchess
marriage
would
steady
him
were
he
a
married
man
tifto
would
of
course
disappear
upon
the
whole
he
thought
it
would
be
good
that
he
should
marry
and
if
so
who
could
be
so
nice
as
lady
mabel
that
his
father
would
be
contented
with
lady
mab
he
was
inclined
to
believe
there
was
no
better
blood
in
england
and
lady
mabel
was
known
to
be
clever
beautiful
and
in
her
peculiar
circumstances
very
wise
he
was
aware
however
of
a
certain
drawback
lady
mabel
as
his
wife
would
be
his
superior
and
in
some
degree
his
master
though
not
older
she
was
wiser
than
he
and
not
only
wiser
but
more
powerful
also
and
he
was
not
quite
sure
but
that
she
regarded
him
as
a
boy
he
thought
that
she
did
love
him
or
would
do
so
if
he
asked
her
but
that
her
love
would
be
bestowed
upon
him
as
on
an
inferior
creature
he
was
already
jealous
of
his
own
dignity
and
fearful
lest
he
should
miss
the
glory
of
being
loved
by
this
lovely
one
for
his
own
sake
for
his
own
manhood
and
his
own
gifts
and
his
own
character
and
yet
his
attraction
to
her
was
so
great
that
now
in
the
day
of
his
sorrow
he
could
think
of
no
solace
but
what
was
to
be
found
in
her
company
not
at
the
oaks
she
said
as
soon
as
he
was
shown
into
the
no
not
at
the
oaks
lord
grex
is
there
i
suppose
oh
yes
that
is
a
matter
of
course
why
are
you
a
recreant
the
house
sits
how
virtuous
is
it
coming
to
that
that
when
the
house
sits
you
will
never
be
absent
that
the
kind
of
life
i
going
to
lead
you
have
heard
about
gerald
about
your
brother
yes
you
have
heard
not
a
word
i
hope
there
is
no
misfortune
but
indeed
there
is
a
most
terrible
misfortune
then
he
told
the
whole
story
how
gerald
had
been
kept
in
london
and
how
he
had
gone
down
to
cambridge
all
in
vain
how
his
father
had
taken
the
matter
to
heart
telling
him
that
he
had
ruined
his
brother
and
how
he
in
consequence
had
determined
not
to
go
to
the
races
then
he
said
continued
silverbridge
that
his
children
between
them
would
bring
him
to
his
grave
that
was
terrible
very
terrible
but
what
did
he
mean
by
that
asked
lady
mabel
anxious
to
hear
something
about
lady
mary
and
tregear
well
of
course
what
i
did
at
oxford
made
him
unhappy
and
now
there
is
this
affair
of
gerald
he
did
not
allude
to
your
sister
yes
he
did
you
have
heard
of
all
that
tregear
told
you
he
told
me
something
of
course
my
father
does
not
like
it
do
you
approve
of
it
no
said
he
curtly
and
sturdily
why
not
you
like
tregear
certainly
i
like
tregear
he
is
the
friend
among
men
whom
i
like
the
best
i
have
only
two
real
friends
who
are
they
she
asked
sinking
her
voice
very
low
he
is
one
and
you
are
the
other
you
know
that
i
hoped
that
i
was
one
she
said
but
if
you
love
tregear
so
dearly
why
do
you
not
approve
of
him
for
your
sister
i
always
knew
it
would
not
do
but
why
not
mary
ought
to
marry
a
man
of
higher
standing
of
higher
rank
you
mean
the
daughters
of
dukes
have
married
commoners
before
it
is
not
exactly
that
i
do
like
to
talk
of
it
in
that
way
i
knew
it
would
make
my
father
unhappy
in
point
of
fact
he
ca
marry
her
what
is
the
good
of
approving
of
a
thing
that
is
impossible
i
wish
i
knew
your
sister
is
she
firm
indeed
she
is
i
am
not
so
sure
that
you
are
no
said
he
after
considering
awhile
nor
am
i
but
she
is
not
like
gerald
or
me
she
is
more
obstinate
less
fickle
perhaps
yes
if
you
choose
to
call
it
fickle
i
do
know
that
i
am
fickle
if
i
were
in
love
with
a
girl
i
should
be
true
to
her
are
you
sure
of
that
quite
sure
if
i
were
really
in
love
with
her
i
certainly
should
not
change
it
is
possible
that
i
might
be
bullied
out
of
it
but
she
will
not
be
bullied
out
of
it
mary
no
that
is
just
it
she
will
stick
to
it
if
he
does
i
would
if
i
were
she
where
will
you
find
any
young
man
equal
to
frank
tregear
perhaps
you
mean
to
cut
poor
mary
out
that
is
a
nice
thing
for
you
to
say
lord
silverbridge
frank
is
my
cousin
as
indeed
you
are
also
but
it
so
happens
that
i
have
seen
a
great
deal
of
him
all
my
life
and
though
i
do
want
to
cut
your
sister
out
as
you
so
prettily
say
i
love
him
well
enough
to
understand
that
any
girl
whom
he
loves
ought
to
be
true
to
him
so
far
what
she
said
was
very
well
but
she
afterwards
added
a
word
which
might
have
been
wisely
omitted
frank
and
i
are
almost
beggars
what
an
accursed
thing
money
is
he
exclaimed
jumping
up
from
his
chair
i
do
agree
with
you
at
all
it
is
a
very
comfortable
thing
how
is
anybody
who
has
got
it
to
know
if
anybody
cares
for
him
you
must
find
that
out
there
is
such
a
thing
i
suppose
as
real
sympathy
you
tell
me
to
my
face
that
you
and
tregear
would
have
been
lovers
only
that
you
are
both
poor
i
never
said
anything
of
the
kind
and
that
he
is
to
be
passed
on
to
my
sister
because
it
is
supposed
that
she
will
have
some
money
you
are
putting
words
into
my
mouth
which
i
never
spoke
and
ideas
into
my
mind
which
i
never
thought
and
of
course
i
feel
the
same
about
myself
how
can
a
fellow
help
it
i
wish
you
had
a
lot
of
money
i
know
it
is
very
kind
of
you
but
why
well
i
ca
explain
myself
he
said
blushing
as
was
his
wont
i
daresay
it
would
make
any
difference
it
would
make
a
great
difference
to
me
as
it
is
having
none
and
knowing
as
i
do
that
papa
and
percival
are
getting
things
into
a
worse
mess
every
day
i
am
obliged
to
hope
that
i
may
some
day
marry
a
man
who
has
got
an
income
i
suppose
so
said
he
still
blushing
but
frowning
at
the
same
time
you
see
i
can
be
very
frank
with
a
real
friend
but
i
am
sure
of
myself
in
this
that
i
will
never
marry
a
man
i
do
not
love
a
girl
need
love
a
man
unless
she
likes
it
i
suppose
she
does
tumble
into
love
as
she
does
into
the
fire
it
would
not
suit
me
to
marry
a
poor
man
and
so
i
do
mean
to
fall
in
love
with
a
poor
man
but
you
do
mean
to
fall
in
love
with
a
rich
one
that
remains
to
be
seen
lord
silverbridge
the
rich
man
will
at
any
rate
have
to
fall
in
love
with
me
first
if
you
know
of
any
one
you
need
not
tell
him
to
be
too
sure
because
he
has
a
good
income
there
popplecourt
he
his
own
master
and
fool
as
he
is
he
knows
how
to
keep
his
money
i
do
want
a
fool
you
must
do
better
for
me
than
lord
popplecourt
what
do
you
say
to
dolly
longstaff
he
would
be
just
the
man
only
he
never
would
take
the
trouble
to
come
out
and
be
married
or
glasslough
i
afraid
he
is
cross
and
would
let
me
have
my
own
way
i
can
only
think
of
one
other
but
you
would
not
take
him
then
you
had
better
not
mention
him
it
is
no
good
crowding
the
list
with
impossibles
i
was
thinking
of
myself
you
are
certainly
one
of
the
impossibles
why
lady
mab
for
twenty
reasons
you
are
too
young
and
you
are
bound
to
oblige
your
father
and
you
are
to
be
wedded
to
parliament
at
any
rate
for
the
next
ten
years
and
altogether
it
would
do
for
a
great
many
reasons
i
suppose
you
do
like
me
well
enough
what
a
question
to
ask
no
my
lord
i
do
not
there
that
what
you
may
call
an
answer
do
you
pretend
to
look
offended
because
if
you
do
i
shall
laugh
at
you
if
you
may
have
your
joke
surely
i
may
have
mine
i
do
see
any
joke
in
it
but
i
do
suppose
i
were
to
say
the
other
thing
oh
lord
silverbridge
you
do
me
so
much
honour
and
now
i
come
to
think
about
it
there
is
no
one
in
the
world
i
am
so
fond
of
as
you
would
that
suit
you
exactly
but
it
would
suit
me
there
papa
do
run
away
it
ever
so
much
past
five
said
the
legislator
and
i
had
intended
to
be
in
the
house
more
than
an
hour
ago
give
my
love
to
miss
cassewary
certainly
miss
cassewary
is
your
most
devoted
friend
wo
you
bring
your
sister
to
see
me
some
day
when
she
is
in
town
i
will
i
should
so
like
to
know
her
as
he
hurried
down
to
the
house
in
a
hansom
he
thought
over
it
all
and
told
himself
that
he
feared
it
would
not
do
she
might
perhaps
accept
him
but
if
so
she
would
do
it
simply
in
order
that
she
might
become
duchess
of
omnium
she
might
he
thought
have
accepted
him
then
had
she
chosen
he
had
spoken
plainly
enough
but
she
had
laughed
at
him
he
felt
that
if
she
loved
him
there
ought
to
have
been
something
of
that
feminine
tremor
of
that
doubting
hesitating
of
which
he
had
perhaps
read
in
novels
and
which
his
own
instincts
taught
him
to
desire
but
there
had
been
no
tremor
nor
hesitating
no
my
lord
i
do
not
she
had
said
when
he
asked
her
to
her
face
whether
she
liked
him
well
enough
to
be
his
wife
no
my
lord
i
do
not
it
was
not
the
refusal
conveyed
in
these
words
which
annoyed
him
he
did
believe
that
if
he
were
to
press
his
suit
with
the
usual
forms
she
would
accept
him
but
it
was
that
there
should
be
such
a
total
absence
of
trepidation
in
her
words
and
manner
before
her
he
blushed
and
hesitated
and
felt
that
he
did
not
know
how
to
express
himself
if
she
would
only
have
done
the
same
then
there
would
have
been
an
equality
then
he
could
have
seized
her
in
his
arms
and
sworn
that
never
never
never
would
he
care
for
any
one
but
her
in
truth
he
saw
everything
as
it
was
only
too
truly
though
she
might
choose
to
marry
him
if
he
pressed
his
request
she
would
never
subject
herself
to
him
as
he
would
have
the
girl
do
whom
he
loved
she
was
his
superior
and
in
every
word
uttered
between
them
showed
that
it
was
so
but
yet
how
beautiful
she
was
how
much
more
beautiful
than
any
other
thing
he
had
ever
seen
he
sat
on
one
of
the
high
seats
behind
sir
timothy
beeswax
and
sir
orlando
drought
listening
or
pretending
to
listen
to
the
speeches
of
three
or
four
gentlemen
respecting
sugar
thinking
of
all
this
till
seven
and
then
he
went
to
dine
with
the
proud
consciousness
of
having
done
his
duty
the
forms
and
methods
of
the
house
were
he
flattered
himself
soaking
into
him
gradually
as
his
father
had
desired
the
theory
of
legislation
was
sinking
into
his
mind
the
welfare
of
the
nation
depended
chiefly
on
sugar
but
he
thought
that
after
all
his
own
welfare
must
depend
on
the
possession
of
mab
grex
chapter
xx
then
he
will
come
again
lady
mabel
when
her
young
lover
left
her
was
for
a
time
freed
from
the
necessity
of
thinking
about
him
by
her
father
he
had
returned
from
the
oaks
in
a
very
bad
humour
lord
grex
had
been
very
badly
treated
by
his
son
whom
he
hated
worse
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
on
the
derby
day
he
had
won
a
large
sum
of
money
which
had
been
to
him
at
the
time
a
matter
of
intense
delight
for
he
was
in
great
want
of
money
but
on
this
day
he
had
discovered
that
his
son
and
heir
had
lost
more
than
he
had
won
and
an
arrangement
had
been
suggested
to
him
that
his
winnings
should
go
to
pay
losings
this
was
a
mode
of
settling
affairs
to
which
the
earl
would
not
listen
for
a
moment
had
he
possessed
the
power
of
putting
a
veto
upon
it
but
there
had
been
a
transaction
lately
between
him
and
his
son
with
reference
to
the
cutting
off
a
certain
entail
under
which
money
was
to
be
paid
to
lord
percival
this
money
had
not
yet
been
forthcoming
and
therefore
the
earl
was
constrained
to
assent
this
was
very
distasteful
to
the
earl
and
he
came
home
therefore
in
a
bad
humour
and
said
a
great
many
disagreeable
things
to
his
daughter
you
know
papa
if
i
could
do
anything
i
would
this
she
said
in
answer
to
a
threat
which
he
had
made
often
before
and
now
repeated
of
getting
rid
altogether
of
the
house
in
belgrave
square
whenever
he
made
this
threat
he
did
not
scruple
to
tell
her
that
the
house
had
to
be
kept
up
solely
for
her
welfare
i
do
see
why
the
deuce
you
do
get
married
you
have
to
do
it
sooner
or
later
that
was
not
a
pleasant
speech
for
a
daughter
to
hear
from
her
father
as
to
that
she
said
it
must
come
or
not
as
chance
will
have
it
if
you
want
me
to
sign
anything
i
will
sign
it
for
she
had
been
asked
to
sign
papers
or
in
other
words
to
surrender
rights
but
for
that
other
matter
it
must
be
left
to
myself
then
he
had
been
very
disagreeable
indeed
they
dined
out
together
of
course
with
all
the
luxury
that
wealth
can
give
there
was
a
carriage
to
take
them
backwards
and
forwards
to
the
next
square
such
as
an
earl
should
have
she
was
splendidly
dressed
as
became
an
earl
daughter
and
he
was
brilliant
with
some
star
which
had
been
accorded
to
him
by
his
sovereign
grateful
minister
in
return
for
staunch
parliamentary
support
no
one
looking
at
them
could
have
imagined
that
such
a
father
could
have
told
such
a
daughter
that
she
must
marry
herself
out
of
the
way
because
as
an
unmarried
girl
she
was
a
burden
during
the
dinner
she
was
very
gay
to
be
gay
was
the
habit
we
may
almost
say
the
work
of
her
life
it
so
chanced
that
she
sat
between
sir
timothy
beeswax
who
in
these
days
was
a
very
great
man
indeed
and
that
very
dolly
longstaff
whom
silverbridge
in
his
irony
had
proposed
to
her
as
a
fitting
suitor
for
her
hand
is
lord
silverbridge
a
cousin
of
yours
asked
sir
timothy
a
very
distant
one
he
has
come
over
to
us
you
know
it
is
such
a
triumph
i
was
so
sorry
to
hear
it
this
however
as
the
reader
knows
was
a
fib
sorry
said
sir
timothy
surely
lord
grex
daughter
must
be
a
conservative
oh
yes
i
am
a
conservative
because
i
was
born
one
i
think
that
people
in
politics
should
remain
as
they
are
born
unless
they
are
very
wise
indeed
when
men
come
to
be
statesmen
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
of
course
they
can
change
backwards
and
forwards
i
hope
that
is
not
intended
for
me
lady
mabel
certainly
not
i
do
know
enough
about
it
to
be
personal
that
however
was
again
not
quite
true
but
i
have
the
greatest
possible
respect
for
the
duke
and
i
think
it
a
pity
that
he
should
be
made
unhappy
by
his
son
do
you
like
the
duke
well
yes
in
a
way
he
is
a
most
respectable
man
and
has
been
a
good
public
servant
all
our
lot
are
ruined
you
know
said
dolly
talking
of
the
races
who
are
your
lot
mr
longstaff
i
one
myself
i
suppose
so
i
utterly
smashed
then
there
percival
i
hope
he
has
not
lost
much
of
course
you
know
he
my
brother
oh
laws
so
he
is
i
always
put
my
foot
in
it
well
he
has
lost
a
lot
and
so
have
silverbridge
and
tifto
perhaps
you
do
know
tifto
i
have
not
the
pleasure
of
knowing
mr
tifto
he
is
a
major
i
think
you
like
major
tifto
he
a
sort
of
racing
coach
to
silverbridge
you
ought
to
know
tifto
and
tregear
is
pretty
nearly
cleared
out
tregear
frank
tregear
i
told
he
has
been
hit
very
heavy
i
hope
he
not
a
friend
of
yours
lady
mabel
indeed
he
is
a
very
dear
friend
and
a
cousin
that
what
i
hear
he
very
much
with
silverbridge
you
know
i
can
not
think
that
tregear
has
lost
money
i
hope
he
has
i
know
i
have
i
wish
someone
would
stick
up
for
me
and
say
that
it
was
impossible
but
that
is
not
tregear
way
of
living
i
can
understand
that
lord
silverbridge
or
percival
should
lose
money
or
me
or
you
if
you
like
to
say
so
or
tifto
i
do
know
anything
about
mr
tifto
major
tifto
or
major
tifto
what
does
it
signify
no
of
course
we
inferior
people
may
lose
our
money
just
as
we
please
but
a
man
who
can
look
as
clever
as
tregear
ought
to
win
always
i
told
you
just
now
that
he
was
a
friend
of
mine
but
do
you
think
that
he
does
look
clever
there
could
be
no
question
but
that
tregear
when
he
disliked
his
company
could
show
his
dislike
by
his
countenance
and
it
was
not
improbable
that
he
had
done
so
in
the
presence
of
adolphus
longstaff
now
tell
the
truth
lady
mabel
does
he
not
look
conceited
sometimes
he
generally
looks
as
if
he
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
which
is
more
than
some
other
people
do
of
course
he
is
a
great
deal
more
clever
than
i
am
i
know
that
but
i
do
think
even
he
can
be
so
clever
as
he
looks
you
so
stupid
that
what
you
ought
to
say
now
sometimes
longstaff
i
deny
myself
the
pleasure
of
saying
what
i
think
when
all
this
was
over
she
was
very
angry
with
herself
for
the
anxiety
she
had
expressed
about
tregear
this
longstaff
was
she
thought
exactly
the
man
to
report
all
she
had
said
in
the
public
room
at
the
club
but
she
had
been
annoyed
by
what
she
had
heard
as
to
her
friend
she
knew
that
he
of
all
men
should
keep
himself
free
from
such
follies
those
others
had
as
it
were
a
right
to
make
fools
of
themselves
it
had
seemed
so
natural
that
the
young
men
of
her
own
class
should
dissipate
their
fortunes
and
their
reputations
by
every
kind
of
extravagance
her
father
had
done
so
and
she
had
never
even
ventured
to
hope
that
her
brother
would
not
follow
her
father
example
but
tregear
if
he
gave
way
to
such
follies
as
these
would
soon
fall
headlong
into
a
pit
from
which
there
would
be
no
escape
and
if
he
did
fall
she
knew
herself
well
enough
to
be
aware
that
she
could
not
stifle
nor
even
conceal
the
misery
which
this
would
occasion
her
as
long
as
he
stood
well
before
the
world
she
would
be
well
able
to
assume
indifference
but
were
he
to
be
precipitated
into
some
bottomless
misfortunes
then
she
could
only
throw
herself
after
him
she
could
see
him
marry
and
smile
and
perhaps
even
like
his
wife
and
while
he
was
doing
so
she
could
also
marry
and
resolve
that
the
husband
whom
she
took
should
be
made
to
think
that
he
had
a
loving
wife
but
were
frank
to
die
then
must
she
fall
upon
his
body
as
though
he
had
been
known
by
all
the
world
to
be
her
lover
something
of
this
feeling
came
upon
her
now
when
she
heard
that
he
had
been
betting
and
had
been
unfortunate
she
had
been
unable
so
to
subdue
herself
as
to
seem
to
be
perfectly
careless
about
it
she
had
begun
by
saying
that
she
had
not
believed
it
but
she
had
believed
it
it
was
so
natural
that
tregear
should
have
done
as
the
others
did
with
whom
he
lived
but
then
the
misfortune
would
be
to
him
so
terrible
so
irremediable
the
reader
however
may
as
well
know
at
once
that
there
was
not
a
word
of
truth
in
the
assertion
after
the
dinner
she
went
home
alone
there
were
other
festivities
to
be
attended
had
she
pleased
to
attend
them
and
poor
miss
cassewary
was
dressed
ready
to
go
with
her
as
chaperone
but
miss
cassewary
was
quite
satisfied
to
be
allowed
to
go
to
bed
in
lieu
of
montacute
jones
great
ball
and
she
had
gone
to
her
bedroom
when
lady
mabel
went
to
her
i
am
glad
you
are
alone
she
said
because
i
want
to
speak
to
you
is
anything
wrong
everything
is
wrong
papa
says
he
must
give
up
this
house
he
says
that
almost
always
when
he
comes
back
from
the
races
and
very
often
when
he
comes
back
from
the
club
percival
has
lost
ever
so
much
i
do
think
my
lord
will
hamper
himself
for
your
brother
i
ca
explain
it
but
there
is
some
horrible
money
complication
it
is
hard
upon
you
and
me
who
am
i
said
miss
cassewary
about
the
dearest
friend
that
ever
a
poor
girl
had
it
is
hard
upon
you
and
upon
me
i
have
given
up
everything
and
what
good
have
i
done
it
is
hard
my
dear
but
after
all
i
do
not
care
much
for
all
that
the
thing
has
been
going
on
so
long
that
one
is
used
to
it
what
is
it
then
ah
yes
what
is
it
how
am
i
to
tell
you
surely
you
can
tell
me
said
the
old
woman
putting
out
her
hand
so
as
to
caress
the
arm
of
the
younger
one
i
could
tell
no
one
else
i
am
sure
of
that
frank
tregear
has
taken
to
gambling
like
the
rest
of
them
who
says
so
he
has
lost
a
lot
of
money
at
these
races
a
man
who
sat
next
me
at
dinner
one
of
those
stupid
fools
that
one
meets
everywhere
told
me
so
he
is
one
of
the
beargarden
set
and
of
course
he
knows
all
about
it
did
he
say
how
much
how
is
he
to
pay
anything
of
all
things
that
men
do
this
is
the
worst
a
man
who
would
think
himself
disgraced
for
ever
if
he
accepted
a
present
of
money
will
not
scruple
to
use
all
his
wits
to
rob
his
friend
of
everything
that
he
has
by
studying
the
run
of
cards
or
by
watching
the
paces
of
some
brutes
of
horses
and
they
consider
themselves
to
be
fine
gentlemen
a
real
gentleman
should
never
want
the
money
out
of
another
man
pocket
should
never
think
of
money
at
all
i
do
know
how
that
is
to
be
helped
my
dear
you
have
got
to
think
of
money
yes
i
have
to
think
of
it
and
do
think
of
it
and
because
i
do
so
i
am
not
what
i
call
a
gentleman
no
my
dear
you
a
lady
psha
you
know
what
i
mean
i
might
have
had
the
feelings
of
a
gentleman
as
well
as
the
best
man
that
ever
was
born
i
have
but
i
have
never
done
anything
so
mean
as
gambling
now
i
have
got
something
else
to
tell
you
what
is
it
you
do
frighten
me
so
when
you
look
like
that
you
may
well
be
frightened
for
if
this
all
comes
round
i
shall
very
soon
be
able
to
dispense
with
you
altogether
his
royal
highness
lord
silverbridge
what
do
you
mean
mabel
he
next
door
to
a
royal
highness
at
any
rate
and
a
much
more
topping
man
than
most
of
them
well
then
his
serene
highness
the
heir
of
the
duke
of
omnium
has
done
me
the
inexpressible
honour
of
asking
me
to
marry
him
no
you
may
well
say
no
and
to
tell
the
truth
exactly
he
did
then
why
do
you
say
he
did
i
do
think
he
did
quite
ask
me
but
he
gave
me
to
understand
that
he
would
do
so
if
i
gave
him
any
encouragement
did
he
mean
it
yes
poor
boy
he
meant
it
with
a
word
with
a
look
he
would
have
been
down
there
kneeling
he
asked
me
whether
i
liked
him
well
enough
what
do
you
think
i
did
what
did
you
do
i
spared
him
out
of
sheer
downright
christian
charity
i
said
to
myself
your
neighbours
be
selfish
unto
him
as
you
would
he
should
do
unto
you
that
is
think
of
his
welfare
though
i
had
him
in
my
net
i
let
him
go
shall
i
go
to
heaven
for
doing
that
i
do
know
said
miss
cassewary
who
was
so
much
perturbed
by
the
news
she
had
heard
as
to
be
unable
to
come
to
any
opinion
on
the
point
just
raised
or
may
i
rather
go
to
the
other
place
from
how
much
embarrassment
should
i
have
relieved
my
father
what
a
friend
i
should
have
made
for
percival
how
much
i
might
have
been
able
to
do
for
frank
and
then
what
a
wife
i
should
have
made
him
i
think
you
would
he
never
get
another
half
so
good
and
he
be
sure
to
get
one
before
long
it
is
a
sort
of
tenderness
that
is
quite
inefficacious
he
will
become
a
prey
as
i
should
have
made
him
a
prey
but
where
is
there
another
who
will
treat
him
so
well
i
can
not
bear
to
hear
you
speak
of
yourself
in
that
way
but
it
is
true
i
know
the
sort
of
girl
he
should
marry
in
the
first
place
she
should
be
two
years
younger
and
four
years
fresher
she
should
be
able
not
only
to
like
him
and
love
him
but
to
worship
him
how
well
i
can
see
her
she
should
have
fair
hair
and
bright
eyes
with
the
sweetest
complexion
and
the
prettiest
little
dimples
two
inches
shorter
than
me
and
the
delight
of
her
life
should
be
to
hang
with
two
hands
on
his
arm
she
should
have
a
feeling
that
her
silverbridge
is
an
apollo
upon
earth
to
me
he
is
a
rather
foolish
but
very
very
young
man
anything
rather
than
a
god
if
i
thought
that
he
would
get
the
fresh
young
girl
with
the
dimples
then
i
ought
to
abstain
if
he
was
in
earnest
said
miss
cassewary
throwing
aside
all
this
badinage
and
thinking
of
the
main
point
if
he
was
in
earnest
he
will
come
again
he
was
quite
in
earnest
then
he
will
come
again
i
do
think
he
will
said
lady
mabel
i
told
him
that
i
was
too
old
for
him
and
i
tried
to
laugh
him
out
of
it
he
does
not
like
being
laughed
at
he
has
been
saved
and
he
will
know
it
but
if
he
should
come
again
i
shall
not
spare
him
again
no
not
twice
i
felt
it
to
be
hard
to
do
so
once
because
i
so
nearly
love
him
there
are
so
many
of
them
who
are
odious
to
me
as
to
whom
the
idea
of
marrying
them
seems
to
be
mixed
somehow
with
an
idea
of
suicide
oh
mabel
but
he
is
as
sweet
as
a
rose
if
i
were
his
sister
or
his
servant
or
his
dog
i
could
be
devoted
to
him
i
can
fancy
that
his
comfort
and
his
success
and
his
name
should
be
everything
to
me
that
is
what
a
wife
ought
to
feel
but
i
could
never
feel
him
to
be
my
superior
that
is
what
a
wife
ought
in
truth
to
feel
think
of
those
two
young
men
and
the
difference
between
them
well
do
look
like
that
at
me
i
often
give
way
and
i
dare
say
after
all
i
shall
live
to
be
the
duchess
of
omnium
then
she
kissed
her
friend
and
went
away
to
her
own
room
chapter
xxi
sir
timothy
beeswax
there
had
lately
been
a
great
conservative
reaction
in
the
country
brought
about
in
part
by
the
industry
and
good
management
of
gentlemen
who
were
strong
on
that
side
but
due
also
in
part
to
the
blunders
and
quarrels
of
their
opponents
that
these
opponents
should
have
blundered
and
quarrelled
being
men
active
and
in
earnest
was
to
have
been
expected
such
blunderings
and
quarrellings
have
been
a
matter
of
course
since
politics
have
been
politics
and
since
religion
has
been
religion
when
men
combine
to
do
nothing
how
should
there
be
disagreement
when
men
combine
to
do
much
how
should
there
not
be
disagreement
thirty
men
can
sit
still
each
as
like
the
other
as
peas
but
put
your
thirty
men
up
to
run
a
race
and
they
will
soon
assume
different
forms
and
in
doing
nothing
you
can
hardly
do
amiss
let
the
doers
of
nothing
have
something
of
action
forced
upon
them
and
they
too
will
blunder
and
quarrel
the
wonder
is
that
there
should
ever
be
in
a
reforming
party
enough
of
consentaneous
action
to
carry
any
reform
the
reforming
or
liberal
party
in
british
politics
had
thus
stumbled
and
stumbled
till
it
fell
and
now
there
had
been
a
great
conservative
reaction
many
of
the
most
liberal
constituencies
in
the
country
had
been
untrue
to
their
old
political
convictions
and
as
the
result
lord
drummond
was
prime
minister
in
the
house
of
lords
with
sir
timothy
beeswax
acting
as
first
man
in
the
house
of
commons
it
can
not
be
denied
that
sir
timothy
had
his
good
points
as
a
politician
he
was
industrious
patient
intelligent
courageous
and
determined
long
before
he
had
had
a
seat
in
the
house
when
he
was
simply
making
his
way
up
to
the
probability
of
a
seat
by
making
a
reputation
as
an
advocate
he
had
resolved
that
he
would
be
more
than
an
more
than
a
judge
more
as
he
thought
it
than
a
chief
justice
but
at
any
rate
something
different
this
plan
he
had
all
but
gained
and
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
he
had
been
moved
by
a
grand
and
manly
ambition
but
there
were
drawbacks
to
the
utility
and
beauty
of
sir
character
as
a
statesman
he
had
no
idea
as
to
the
necessity
or
of
any
measure
whatever
in
reference
to
the
of
the
country
it
may
indeed
be
said
that
all
such
ideas
were
to
him
absurd
and
the
fact
that
they
should
be
held
by
his
friends
and
supporters
was
an
inconvenience
he
was
not
in
accord
with
those
who
declare
that
a
parliament
is
a
collection
of
windbags
which
puff
and
blow
and
crack
to
the
annoyance
of
honest
men
but
to
him
parliament
was
a
debating
place
by
having
a
majority
in
which
and
by
no
other
means
he
or
another
might
become
the
great
man
of
the
day
by
no
other
than
parliamentary
means
could
such
a
one
as
he
come
to
be
the
chief
man
and
this
use
of
parliament
either
on
his
own
behalf
or
on
behalf
of
others
had
been
for
so
many
years
present
to
his
mind
that
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
absurd
in
an
institution
supported
for
such
a
purpose
parliament
was
a
club
so
eligible
in
its
nature
that
all
englishmen
wished
to
belong
to
it
they
who
succeeded
were
acknowledged
to
be
the
cream
of
the
land
they
who
dominated
in
it
were
the
cream
of
the
cream
those
two
who
were
elected
to
be
the
chiefs
of
the
two
parties
had
more
of
cream
in
their
composition
than
any
others
but
he
who
could
be
the
chief
of
the
strongest
party
and
who
therefore
in
accordance
with
the
prevailing
arrangements
of
the
country
should
have
the
power
of
making
dukes
and
bestowing
garters
and
appointing
bishops
he
who
by
attaining
the
first
seat
should
achieve
the
right
of
snubbing
all
before
him
whether
friends
or
foes
he
according
to
the
feelings
of
sir
timothy
would
have
gained
an
elysium
of
creaminess
not
to
be
found
in
any
other
position
on
the
earth
surface
no
man
was
more
warmly
attached
to
parliamentary
government
than
sir
timothy
beeswax
but
i
do
not
think
that
he
ever
cared
much
for
legislation
parliamentary
management
was
his
forte
there
have
been
various
rocks
on
which
men
have
shattered
their
barks
in
their
attempts
to
sail
successfully
into
the
harbours
of
parliamentary
management
there
is
the
great
senator
who
declares
to
himself
that
personally
he
will
have
neither
friend
nor
foe
there
is
his
country
before
him
and
its
welfare
within
his
bosom
is
the
fire
of
patriotism
and
within
his
mind
the
examples
of
all
past
time
he
knows
that
he
can
be
just
he
teaches
himself
to
be
eloquent
and
he
strives
to
be
wise
but
he
will
not
bend
and
at
last
in
some
great
solitude
though
closely
surrounded
by
those
whose
love
he
had
neglected
to
acquire
he
breaks
his
heart
then
there
is
he
who
seeing
the
misfortune
of
that
great
one
tells
himself
that
patriotism
judgment
industry
and
eloquence
will
not
suffice
for
him
unless
he
himself
can
be
loved
to
do
great
things
a
man
must
have
a
great
following
and
to
achieve
that
he
must
be
popular
so
he
smiles
and
learns
the
necessary
wiles
he
is
all
for
his
country
and
his
friends
but
for
his
friends
first
he
too
must
be
eloquent
and
well
instructed
in
the
ways
of
parliament
must
be
wise
and
diligent
but
in
all
that
he
does
and
all
that
he
says
he
must
first
study
his
party
it
is
well
with
him
for
a
time
but
he
has
closed
the
door
of
his
elysium
too
rigidly
those
without
gradually
become
stronger
than
his
friends
within
and
so
he
falls
but
may
not
the
door
be
occasionally
opened
to
an
outsider
so
that
the
exterior
force
be
diminished
we
know
how
great
is
the
pressure
of
water
and
how
the
peril
of
an
overwhelming
weight
of
it
may
be
removed
by
opening
the
way
for
a
small
current
there
comes
therefore
the
statesman
who
acknowledges
to
himself
that
he
will
be
pregnable
that
as
a
statesman
he
should
have
enemies
is
a
matter
of
course
against
moderate
enemies
he
will
hold
his
own
but
when
there
comes
one
immoderately
forcible
violently
inimical
then
to
that
man
he
will
open
his
bosom
he
will
tempt
into
his
camp
with
an
offer
of
high
command
any
foe
that
may
be
worth
his
purchase
this
too
has
answered
well
but
there
is
a
nemesis
the
loyalty
of
officers
so
procured
must
be
open
to
suspicion
the
man
who
has
said
bitter
things
against
you
will
never
sit
at
your
feet
in
contented
submission
nor
will
your
friend
of
old
standing
long
endure
to
be
superseded
by
such
converts
all
these
dangers
sir
timothy
had
seen
and
studied
and
for
each
of
them
he
had
hoped
to
be
able
to
provide
an
antidote
love
can
not
do
all
fear
may
do
more
fear
acknowledges
a
superior
love
desires
an
equal
love
is
to
be
created
by
benefits
done
and
means
gratitude
which
we
all
know
to
be
weak
but
hope
which
refers
itself
to
benefits
to
come
is
of
all
our
feelings
the
strongest
and
sir
timothy
had
parliamentary
doctrines
concealed
in
the
depths
of
his
own
bosom
more
important
even
than
these
the
statesman
who
falls
is
he
who
does
much
and
thus
injures
many
the
statesman
who
stands
the
longest
is
he
who
does
nothing
and
injures
no
one
he
soon
knew
that
the
work
which
he
had
taken
in
hand
required
all
the
art
of
a
great
conjuror
he
must
be
possessed
of
tricks
so
marvellous
that
not
even
they
who
sat
nearest
to
him
might
know
how
they
were
performed
for
the
executive
or
legislative
business
of
the
country
he
cared
little
the
one
should
be
left
in
the
hands
of
men
who
liked
work
of
the
other
there
should
be
little
or
if
possible
none
but
parliament
must
be
managed
and
his
party
of
patriotism
he
did
not
know
the
meaning
few
perhaps
do
beyond
a
feeling
that
they
would
like
to
lick
the
russians
or
to
get
the
better
of
the
americans
in
a
matter
of
fisheries
or
frontiers
but
he
invented
a
conjuring
phraseology
which
no
one
understood
but
which
many
admired
he
was
ambitious
that
it
should
be
said
of
him
that
he
was
the
cleverest
of
his
party
he
knew
himself
to
be
clever
but
he
could
only
be
the
cleverest
by
saying
and
doing
that
which
no
one
could
understand
if
he
could
become
master
of
some
great
system
which
could
be
made
to
be
graceful
to
the
ears
and
eyes
of
many
which
might
for
awhile
seem
to
have
within
it
some
attribute
which
should
have
all
but
divine
power
of
mastering
the
loaves
and
fishes
then
would
they
who
followed
him
believe
in
him
more
firmly
than
other
followers
who
had
believed
in
their
leaders
when
you
see
a
young
woman
read
a
closed
book
placed
on
her
dorsal
vertebræ
if
you
do
believe
that
she
so
reads
it
you
think
that
she
is
endowed
with
a
wonderful
faculty
and
should
you
also
be
made
to
believe
that
the
same
young
woman
had
direct
communication
with
abraham
by
means
of
some
invisible
wire
you
would
be
apt
to
do
a
great
many
things
as
that
young
woman
might
tell
you
conjuring
when
not
known
to
be
conjuring
is
very
effective
much
no
doubt
of
sir
timothy
power
had
come
from
his
praiseworthy
industry
though
he
cared
nothing
for
the
making
of
laws
though
he
knew
nothing
of
finance
though
he
had
abandoned
his
legal
studies
still
he
worked
hard
and
because
he
had
worked
harder
in
a
special
direction
than
others
around
him
therefore
he
was
enabled
to
lead
them
the
management
of
a
party
is
a
very
great
work
in
itself
and
when
to
that
is
added
the
management
of
the
house
of
commons
a
man
has
enough
upon
his
hands
even
though
he
neglects
altogether
the
ordinary
pursuits
of
a
statesman
those
around
sir
timothy
were
fond
of
their
party
but
they
were
for
the
most
part
men
who
had
not
condescended
to
put
their
shoulders
to
the
wheel
as
he
had
done
had
there
been
any
very
great
light
among
them
had
there
been
a
pitt
or
a
peel
sir
timothy
would
have
probably
become
and
have
made
his
way
to
the
bench
but
there
had
been
no
pitt
and
no
peel
and
he
had
seen
his
opening
he
had
studied
the
ways
of
members
parliamentary
practice
had
become
familiar
to
him
he
had
shown
himself
to
be
ready
at
all
hours
to
fight
the
battle
of
the
party
he
had
joined
and
no
man
knew
so
well
as
did
sir
timothy
how
to
elevate
a
simple
legislative
attempt
into
a
good
faction
fight
he
had
so
mastered
his
tricks
of
conjuring
that
no
one
could
get
to
the
bottom
of
them
and
had
assumed
a
look
of
preternatural
gravity
which
made
many
young
members
think
that
sir
timothy
was
born
to
be
a
king
of
men
there
were
no
doubt
some
among
his
older
supporters
who
felt
their
thraldom
grievously
there
were
some
lords
in
the
upper
house
and
some
sons
of
the
lords
in
the
lower
with
pedigrees
going
back
far
enough
for
pride
who
found
it
irksome
to
recognise
sir
timothy
as
a
master
no
doubt
he
had
worked
very
hard
and
had
worked
for
them
no
doubt
he
knew
how
to
do
the
work
and
they
did
not
there
was
no
other
man
among
them
to
whom
the
lead
could
be
conveniently
transferred
but
yet
they
were
uncomfortable
and
perhaps
a
little
ashamed
it
had
arisen
partly
from
this
cause
that
there
had
been
something
of
a
at
the
last
general
election
when
the
houses
met
the
ministers
had
indeed
a
majority
but
a
much
lessened
majority
the
old
liberal
constituencies
had
returned
to
an
expression
of
their
real
feeling
this
reassertion
of
the
progress
of
the
tide
this
recovery
from
the
partial
ebb
which
checks
the
violence
of
every
flow
is
common
enough
in
politics
but
at
the
present
moment
there
were
many
who
said
that
all
this
had
been
accelerated
by
a
feeling
in
the
country
that
sir
timothy
was
hardly
all
that
the
country
required
as
the
leader
of
the
country
party
chapter
xxii
the
duke
in
his
study
it
was
natural
that
at
such
a
time
when
success
greater
than
had
been
expected
had
attended
the
efforts
of
the
liberals
when
some
dozen
unexpected
votes
had
been
acquired
the
leading
politicians
of
that
party
should
have
found
themselves
compelled
to
look
about
them
and
see
how
these
good
things
might
be
utilised
in
february
they
certainly
had
not
expected
to
be
called
to
power
in
the
course
of
the
existing
session
perhaps
they
did
not
expect
it
yet
there
was
still
a
conservative
majority
though
but
a
small
majority
but
the
strength
of
the
minority
consisted
not
in
the
fact
that
the
majority
against
them
was
small
but
that
it
was
decreasing
how
quickly
does
the
snowball
grow
into
hugeness
as
it
is
rolled
on
but
when
the
change
comes
in
the
weather
how
quickly
does
it
melt
and
before
it
is
gone
become
a
thing
ugly
weak
and
formless
where
is
the
individual
who
does
not
assert
to
himself
that
he
would
be
more
loyal
to
a
falling
than
to
a
rising
friend
such
is
perhaps
the
nature
of
each
one
of
us
but
when
any
large
number
of
men
act
together
the
falling
friend
is
apt
to
be
deserted
there
was
a
general
feeling
among
politicians
that
lord
drummond
ministry
or
sir
timothy
was
failing
and
the
liberals
though
they
could
not
yet
count
the
votes
by
which
they
might
hope
to
be
supported
in
power
nevertheless
felt
that
they
ought
to
be
looking
to
their
arms
there
had
been
a
coalition
they
who
are
well
read
in
the
political
literature
of
their
country
will
remember
all
about
that
it
had
perhaps
succeeded
in
doing
that
for
which
it
had
been
intended
the
queen
government
had
been
carried
on
for
two
or
three
years
the
duke
of
omnium
had
been
the
head
of
that
ministry
but
during
those
years
had
suffered
so
much
as
to
have
become
utterly
ashamed
of
the
coalition
so
much
as
to
have
said
often
to
himself
that
under
no
circumstances
would
he
again
join
any
ministry
at
this
time
there
was
no
idea
of
another
coalition
that
is
a
state
of
things
which
can
not
come
about
frequently
which
can
only
be
reproduced
by
men
who
have
never
hitherto
felt
the
mean
insipidity
of
such
a
condition
but
they
who
had
served
on
the
liberal
side
in
that
coalition
must
again
put
their
shoulders
to
the
wheel
of
course
it
was
in
every
man
mouth
that
the
duke
must
be
induced
to
forget
his
miseries
and
once
more
to
take
upon
himself
the
duties
of
an
active
servant
of
the
state
but
they
who
were
most
anxious
on
the
subject
such
men
as
lord
cantrip
monk
our
old
friend
phineas
finn
and
a
few
others
were
almost
afraid
to
approach
him
at
the
moment
when
the
coalition
was
broken
up
he
had
been
very
bitter
in
spirit
apparently
almost
arrogant
holding
himself
aloof
from
his
late
colleagues
and
since
that
troubles
had
come
to
him
which
had
aggravated
the
soreness
of
his
heart
his
wife
had
died
and
he
had
suffered
much
through
his
children
what
lord
silverbridge
had
done
at
oxford
was
matter
of
general
conversation
and
also
what
he
had
not
done
that
the
heir
of
the
family
should
have
become
a
renegade
in
politics
was
supposed
greatly
to
have
affected
the
father
now
lord
gerald
had
been
expelled
from
cambridge
and
silverbridge
was
on
the
turf
in
conjunction
with
major
tifto
something
too
had
oozed
out
into
general
ears
about
lady
mary
something
which
should
have
been
kept
secret
as
the
grave
it
had
therefore
come
to
pass
that
it
was
difficult
even
to
address
the
duke
there
was
one
man
and
but
one
who
could
do
this
with
ease
to
himself
and
that
man
was
at
last
put
into
motion
at
the
instance
of
the
leaders
of
the
party
the
old
duke
of
bungay
wrote
the
following
letter
to
the
duke
of
omnium
the
letter
purported
to
be
an
excuse
for
the
writer
own
defalcation
but
the
chief
object
of
the
writer
was
to
induce
the
younger
duke
once
more
to
submit
to
harness
longroyston
june
dear
duke
of
omnium
how
quickly
the
things
come
round
i
had
thought
that
i
should
never
again
have
been
called
upon
even
to
think
of
the
formation
of
another
liberal
ministry
and
now
though
it
was
but
yesterday
that
we
were
all
telling
ourselves
that
we
were
thoroughly
manumitted
from
our
labours
by
the
altered
opinions
of
the
country
sundry
of
our
old
friends
are
again
putting
their
heads
together
did
they
not
do
so
they
would
neglect
a
manifest
duty
nothing
is
more
essential
to
the
political
of
the
country
than
that
the
leaders
on
both
sides
in
politics
should
be
prepared
for
their
duties
but
for
myself
i
am
bound
at
last
to
put
in
the
old
plea
with
a
determination
that
it
shall
be
respected
solve
senescentem
it
is
now
if
i
calculate
rightly
exactly
fifty
years
since
i
first
entered
public
life
in
obedience
to
the
advice
of
lord
grey
i
had
then
already
sat
five
years
in
the
house
of
commons
i
assisted
humbly
in
the
emancipation
of
the
roman
catholics
and
have
learned
by
the
legislative
troubles
of
just
half
a
century
that
those
whom
we
then
invited
to
sit
with
us
in
parliament
have
been
in
all
things
our
worst
enemies
but
what
then
had
we
benefited
only
those
who
love
us
would
not
the
sinners
also
or
even
the
tories
have
done
as
much
as
that
but
such
memories
are
of
no
avail
now
i
write
to
say
that
after
so
much
of
active
political
life
i
will
at
last
retire
my
friends
when
they
see
me
inspecting
a
pigsty
or
picking
a
peach
are
apt
to
remind
me
that
i
can
still
stand
on
my
legs
and
with
more
of
compliment
than
of
kindness
will
argue
therefore
that
i
ought
still
to
undertake
active
duties
in
parliament
i
can
select
my
own
hours
for
pigs
and
peaches
and
should
i
through
the
dotage
of
age
make
mistakes
as
to
the
breeding
of
the
one
or
the
flavour
of
the
other
the
harm
done
will
not
go
far
in
politics
i
have
done
my
work
what
you
and
others
in
the
arena
do
will
interest
me
more
than
all
other
things
of
this
world
i
think
and
hope
to
my
dying
day
but
i
will
not
trouble
the
workers
with
the
querulousness
of
old
age
so
much
for
myself
and
now
let
me
as
i
go
say
a
parting
word
to
him
with
whom
in
politics
i
have
been
for
many
years
more
in
accord
than
with
any
other
leading
man
as
nothing
but
age
or
infirmity
would
to
my
own
mind
have
justified
me
in
retiring
so
do
i
think
that
you
who
can
plead
neither
age
nor
infirmity
will
find
yourself
at
last
to
want
if
you
permit
yourself
to
be
driven
from
the
task
either
by
pride
or
by
indifference
i
should
express
my
feelings
better
were
i
to
say
by
pride
and
diffidence
i
look
to
our
old
friendship
to
the
authority
given
to
me
by
my
age
and
to
the
thorough
goodness
of
your
heart
for
pardon
in
thus
accusing
you
that
little
men
should
have
ventured
to
you
has
hurt
your
pride
that
these
little
men
should
have
been
able
to
do
so
has
created
your
diffidence
put
you
to
a
piece
of
work
that
a
man
may
do
you
have
less
false
pride
as
to
the
way
in
which
you
may
do
it
than
any
man
i
have
known
and
let
the
way
be
open
to
you
as
little
diffidence
as
any
but
in
this
political
mill
of
ours
in
england
a
man
can
not
always
find
the
way
open
to
do
things
it
does
not
often
happen
that
an
english
statesman
can
go
in
and
make
a
great
score
off
his
own
bat
but
not
the
less
is
he
bound
to
play
the
game
and
to
go
to
the
wicket
when
he
finds
that
his
time
has
come
there
are
i
think
two
things
for
you
to
consider
in
this
matter
and
two
only
the
first
is
your
capacity
and
the
other
is
your
duty
a
man
may
have
found
by
experience
that
he
is
unfitted
for
public
life
you
and
i
have
known
men
in
regard
to
whom
we
have
thoroughly
wished
that
such
experience
had
been
reached
but
this
is
a
matter
in
which
a
man
who
doubts
himself
is
bound
to
take
the
evidence
of
those
around
him
the
whole
party
is
most
anxious
for
your
if
this
be
so
and
i
make
you
the
assurance
from
most
conclusive
evidence
you
are
bound
to
accept
the
common
consent
of
your
political
friends
on
that
matter
you
perhaps
think
that
at
a
certain
period
of
your
life
you
failed
they
all
agree
with
me
that
you
did
not
fail
it
is
a
matter
on
which
you
should
be
bound
by
our
opinion
rather
than
by
your
own
as
to
that
matter
of
duty
i
shall
have
less
difficulty
in
carrying
you
with
me
though
this
renewed
task
may
be
personally
disagreeable
to
you
even
though
your
tastes
should
lead
you
to
some
other
life
which
i
think
is
not
the
case
still
if
your
country
wants
you
you
should
serve
your
country
it
is
a
work
as
to
which
such
a
one
as
you
has
no
option
of
most
of
those
who
choose
public
life
it
may
be
said
that
were
they
not
there
there
would
be
others
as
serviceable
but
when
a
man
such
as
you
has
shown
himself
to
be
necessary
as
long
as
health
and
age
permit
he
can
not
recede
without
breach
of
manifest
duty
the
work
to
be
done
is
so
important
the
numbers
to
be
benefited
are
so
great
that
he
can
not
be
justified
in
even
remembering
that
he
has
a
self
as
i
have
said
before
i
trust
that
my
own
age
and
your
goodness
will
induce
you
to
pardon
this
great
interference
but
whether
pardoned
or
not
i
shall
always
be
your
most
affectionate
friend
bungay
the
duke
our
duke
on
reading
this
letter
was
by
no
means
pleased
by
its
contents
he
could
ill
bear
to
be
reminded
either
of
his
pride
or
of
his
diffidence
and
yet
the
accusations
which
others
made
against
him
were
as
nothing
to
those
with
which
he
charged
himself
he
would
do
this
till
at
last
he
was
forced
to
defend
himself
against
himself
by
asking
himself
whether
he
could
be
other
than
as
god
had
made
him
it
is
the
last
and
the
poorest
makeshift
of
a
defence
to
which
a
man
can
be
brought
in
his
own
court
was
it
his
fault
that
he
was
so
that
all
things
hurt
him
when
some
coarse
man
said
to
him
that
which
ought
not
to
have
been
said
was
it
his
fault
that
at
every
word
a
penknife
had
stabbed
him
other
men
had
borne
these
buffets
without
shrinking
and
had
shown
themselves
thereby
to
be
more
useful
much
more
efficacious
but
he
could
no
more
imitate
them
than
he
could
procure
for
himself
the
skin
of
a
rhinoceros
or
the
tusk
of
an
elephant
and
this
shrinking
was
what
men
called
pride
was
the
pride
of
which
his
old
friend
wrote
have
i
ever
been
haughty
unless
in
my
own
defence
he
asked
himself
remembering
certain
passages
of
humility
in
his
life
and
certain
passages
of
haughtiness
also
and
the
duke
told
him
also
that
he
was
diffident
of
course
he
was
diffident
was
it
not
one
and
the
same
thing
the
very
pride
of
which
he
was
accused
was
no
more
than
that
shrinking
which
comes
from
the
want
of
trust
in
oneself
he
was
a
shy
man
all
his
friends
and
all
his
enemies
knew
that
it
was
thus
that
he
still
discoursed
with
himself
a
shy
timid
shrinking
man
of
course
he
was
diffident
then
why
urge
him
on
to
tasks
for
which
he
was
by
nature
unfitted
and
yet
there
was
much
in
his
old
friend
letter
which
moved
him
there
were
certain
words
which
he
kept
on
repeating
to
himself
he
can
not
be
justified
in
even
remembering
that
he
has
a
self
it
was
a
hard
thing
to
say
of
any
man
but
yet
a
true
thing
of
such
a
man
as
his
correspondent
had
described
his
correspondent
had
spoken
of
a
man
who
should
know
himself
to
be
capable
of
serving
the
state
if
a
man
were
capable
and
was
sure
within
his
own
bosom
of
his
own
capacity
it
would
be
his
duty
but
what
if
he
were
not
so
satisfied
what
if
he
felt
that
any
labours
of
his
would
be
vain
and
all
useless
his
friend
had
told
him
that
on
that
matter
he
was
bound
to
take
the
opinion
of
others
perhaps
so
but
if
so
had
not
that
opinion
been
given
to
him
very
plainly
when
he
was
told
that
he
was
both
proud
and
diffident
that
he
was
called
upon
to
serve
his
country
by
good
service
if
such
were
within
his
power
he
did
acknowledge
freely
but
not
that
he
should
allow
himself
to
be
stuck
up
as
a
ninepin
only
to
be
knocked
down
there
are
politicians
for
whom
such
occupation
seems
to
be
proper
and
who
like
it
too
a
little
office
a
little
power
a
little
rank
a
little
pay
a
little
niche
in
the
ephemeral
history
of
the
year
will
reward
many
men
adequately
for
being
knocked
down
and
yet
he
loved
power
and
even
when
thinking
of
all
this
allowed
his
mind
from
time
to
time
to
run
away
into
a
dreamland
of
prosperous
political
labours
he
thought
what
it
would
be
to
be
an
prime
minister
with
a
loyal
majority
with
a
unanimous
cabinet
with
a
grateful
people
and
an
appreciative
sovereign
how
well
might
a
man
spend
himself
night
and
day
even
to
death
in
the
midst
of
labours
such
as
these
half
an
hour
after
receiving
the
duke
letter
he
suddenly
jumped
up
and
sat
himself
down
at
his
desk
he
felt
it
to
be
necessary
that
he
should
at
once
write
to
his
old
friend
and
the
more
necessary
that
he
should
do
so
at
once
because
he
had
resolved
that
he
would
do
so
before
he
had
made
up
his
mind
on
the
chief
subject
of
that
letter
it
did
not
suit
him
to
say
either
that
he
would
or
that
he
would
not
do
as
his
friend
advised
him
the
reply
was
made
in
a
very
few
words
as
to
myself
he
said
after
expressing
his
regret
that
the
duke
should
find
it
necessary
to
retire
from
public
life
as
to
myself
pray
understand
that
whatever
i
may
do
i
shall
never
cease
to
be
grateful
for
your
affectionate
and
counsels
then
his
mind
recurred
to
a
more
immediate
and
for
the
moment
a
heavier
trouble
he
had
as
yet
given
no
answer
to
that
letter
from
finn
which
the
reader
will
perhaps
remember
it
might
indeed
be
passed
over
without
an
answer
but
to
him
that
was
impossible
she
had
accused
him
in
the
very
strongest
language
of
injustice
and
had
made
him
understand
that
if
he
were
unjust
to
her
then
would
he
be
most
ungrateful
he
looking
at
the
matter
with
his
own
lights
had
thought
that
he
had
been
right
but
had
resolved
to
submit
the
question
to
another
person
as
judge
in
the
matter
he
had
chosen
lady
cantrip
and
lady
cantrip
had
given
judgment
against
him
he
had
pressed
lady
cantrip
for
a
decided
opinion
and
she
had
told
him
that
she
in
the
same
position
would
have
done
just
as
finn
had
done
he
had
constituted
lady
cantrip
his
judge
and
had
resolved
that
her
judgment
should
be
final
he
declared
to
himself
that
he
did
not
understand
it
if
a
man
house
be
on
fire
do
you
think
of
certain
rules
of
etiquette
before
you
bid
him
send
for
the
engines
if
a
wild
beast
be
loose
do
you
go
through
some
ceremony
before
you
caution
the
wanderers
abroad
there
should
not
have
been
a
moment
but
nevertheless
it
was
now
necessary
that
he
should
conform
himself
to
the
opinion
of
lady
cantrip
and
in
doing
so
he
must
apologise
for
the
bitter
scorn
with
which
he
had
allowed
himself
to
treat
his
wife
most
loyal
and
loving
friend
the
few
words
to
the
duke
had
not
been
difficult
but
this
letter
seemed
to
be
an
herculean
task
it
was
made
infinitely
more
difficult
by
the
fact
that
lady
cantrip
had
not
seemed
to
think
that
this
marriage
was
impossible
young
people
when
they
have
set
their
minds
upon
it
do
so
generally
prevail
at
last
these
had
been
her
words
and
they
discomforted
him
greatly
she
had
thought
the
marriage
to
be
possible
had
she
not
almost
expressed
an
opinion
that
they
ought
to
be
allowed
to
marry
and
if
so
would
it
not
be
his
duty
to
take
his
girl
away
from
lady
cantrip
as
to
the
idea
that
young
people
because
they
have
declared
themselves
to
be
in
love
were
to
have
just
what
they
wanted
with
that
he
did
not
agree
at
all
lady
cantrip
had
told
him
that
young
people
generally
did
prevail
at
last
he
knew
the
story
of
one
young
person
whose
position
in
her
youth
had
been
very
much
the
same
as
that
of
his
daughter
now
and
she
had
not
prevailed
and
in
her
case
had
not
the
opposition
which
had
been
made
to
her
wishes
been
most
fortunate
that
young
person
had
become
his
wife
his
glencora
his
duchess
had
she
been
allowed
to
have
her
own
way
when
she
was
a
child
what
would
have
been
her
fate
ah
what
then
he
had
to
think
of
it
all
might
she
not
have
been
alive
now
and
perhaps
happier
than
she
had
ever
been
with
him
and
had
he
remained
always
unmarried
devoted
simply
to
politics
would
not
the
troubles
of
the
world
have
been
lighter
on
him
but
what
had
that
to
do
with
it
in
these
matters
it
was
not
the
happiness
of
this
or
that
individual
which
should
be
considered
there
is
a
propriety
in
things
and
only
by
an
adherence
to
that
propriety
on
the
part
of
individuals
can
the
general
welfare
be
maintained
a
king
in
this
country
or
the
heir
or
the
possible
heir
to
the
throne
is
debarred
from
what
might
possibly
be
a
happy
marriage
by
regard
to
the
good
of
his
subjects
to
the
duke
thinking
the
maintenance
of
the
aristocracy
of
the
country
was
second
only
in
importance
to
the
maintenance
of
the
crown
how
should
the
aristocracy
be
maintained
if
its
wealth
were
allowed
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
an
adventurer
such
were
the
opinions
with
regard
to
his
own
order
of
one
who
was
as
truly
liberal
in
his
ideas
as
any
man
in
england
and
who
had
argued
out
these
ideas
to
their
consequences
as
by
the
spread
of
education
and
increase
of
general
every
proletaire
was
brought
nearer
to
a
duke
so
by
such
action
would
the
duke
be
brought
nearer
to
a
proletaire
such
of
the
classes
was
the
object
to
which
all
this
man
political
action
tended
and
yet
it
was
a
dreadful
thing
to
him
that
his
own
daughter
should
desire
to
marry
a
man
so
much
beneath
her
own
rank
and
fortune
as
frank
tregear
he
would
not
allow
himself
to
believe
that
the
young
people
could
ever
prevail
but
nevertheless
as
the
idea
of
the
thing
had
not
alarmed
lady
cantrip
as
it
had
him
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
make
some
apology
to
finn
each
moment
of
procrastination
was
a
prick
to
his
conscience
he
now
therefore
dragged
out
from
the
secrecy
of
some
close
drawer
finn
letter
and
read
it
through
to
himself
once
again
yes
it
was
true
that
he
had
condemned
her
and
that
he
had
punished
her
though
he
had
done
nothing
to
her
and
said
nothing
and
written
but
very
little
still
he
had
punished
her
most
severely
she
had
written
as
though
the
matter
was
almost
one
of
life
and
death
to
her
he
could
understand
that
too
his
uncle
conduct
to
this
woman
and
his
wife
had
created
the
intimacy
which
had
existed
through
their
efforts
she
had
become
almost
as
one
of
the
family
and
now
to
be
dismissed
like
a
servant
who
had
misbehaved
herself
and
then
her
arguments
in
her
own
defence
were
all
so
good
if
only
that
which
lady
cantrip
had
laid
down
as
law
was
to
be
held
as
law
he
was
aware
now
that
she
had
had
no
knowledge
of
the
matter
till
his
daughter
had
told
her
of
the
engagement
at
matching
then
it
was
evident
also
that
she
had
sent
this
tregear
to
him
immediately
on
her
return
to
london
and
at
the
end
of
the
letter
she
accused
him
of
what
she
had
been
pleased
to
call
his
usual
tenacity
in
believing
ill
of
her
he
had
been
obstinate
too
obstinate
in
this
respect
but
he
did
not
love
her
the
better
for
having
told
him
of
it
at
last
he
did
put
his
apology
into
words
my
dear
finn
i
believe
i
had
better
acknowledge
to
you
at
once
that
i
have
been
wrong
in
my
judgment
as
to
your
conduct
in
a
certain
matter
you
tell
me
that
i
owe
it
to
you
to
make
this
acknowledgment
and
i
make
it
the
subject
is
as
you
may
imagine
so
painful
that
i
will
spare
myself
if
possible
any
further
allusion
to
it
i
believe
i
did
you
a
wrong
and
therefore
i
write
to
ask
your
pardon
i
should
perhaps
apologise
also
for
delay
in
my
reply
i
have
had
much
to
think
of
in
this
matter
and
have
many
others
also
on
my
mind
believe
me
to
be
yours
faithfully
omnium
it
was
very
short
and
as
being
short
was
infinitely
less
troublesome
at
the
moment
than
a
fuller
epistle
but
he
was
angry
with
himself
knowing
that
it
was
too
short
feeling
that
it
was
ungracious
he
should
have
expressed
a
hope
that
he
might
soon
see
her
again
only
he
had
no
such
wish
there
had
been
times
at
which
he
had
liked
her
but
he
knew
that
he
did
not
like
her
now
and
yet
he
was
bound
to
be
her
friend
if
he
could
only
do
some
great
thing
for
her
and
thus
satisfy
his
feeling
of
indebtedness
towards
her
but
all
the
favours
had
been
from
her
to
him
and
his
chapter
xxiii
frank
tregear
wants
a
friend
six
or
seven
weeks
had
passed
since
tregear
had
made
his
communication
to
the
duke
and
during
that
time
he
had
heard
not
a
word
about
the
girl
he
loved
he
knew
indeed
that
she
was
at
the
horns
and
probably
had
reason
to
suppose
that
she
was
being
guarded
there
as
it
were
out
of
his
reach
this
did
not
surprise
him
nor
did
he
regard
it
as
a
hardship
it
was
to
be
expected
that
she
should
be
kept
out
of
his
sight
but
this
was
a
state
of
things
to
which
as
he
thought
there
should
not
be
more
than
a
moderate
amount
of
submission
six
weeks
was
not
a
very
long
period
but
it
was
perhaps
long
enough
for
evincing
that
respect
which
he
owed
to
the
young
lady
father
something
must
be
done
some
day
how
could
he
expect
her
to
be
true
to
him
unless
he
took
some
means
of
showing
himself
to
be
true
to
her
in
these
days
he
did
not
live
very
much
with
her
brother
he
not
only
disliked
but
distrusted
major
tifto
and
had
so
expressed
himself
as
to
give
rise
to
angry
words
silverbridge
had
said
that
he
knew
how
to
take
care
of
himself
tregear
had
replied
that
he
had
his
doubts
on
that
matter
then
the
member
of
parliament
had
declared
that
at
any
rate
he
did
not
intend
to
be
taken
care
of
by
frank
tregear
in
such
a
state
of
things
it
was
not
possible
that
there
should
be
any
close
confidence
as
to
lady
mary
nor
does
it
often
come
to
pass
that
the
brother
is
the
confidant
of
the
sister
lover
brothers
hardly
like
their
sisters
to
have
lovers
though
they
are
often
well
satisfied
that
their
sisters
should
find
husbands
tregear
want
of
rank
and
wealth
added
something
to
this
feeling
in
the
mind
of
this
brother
so
that
silverbridge
though
he
felt
himself
to
be
deterred
by
friendship
from
any
open
opposition
still
was
almost
inimical
it
wo
do
you
know
he
had
said
to
his
brother
gerald
shaking
his
head
tregear
however
was
determined
to
be
active
in
the
matter
to
make
some
effort
to
speak
to
somebody
but
how
to
make
an
effort
and
to
whom
should
he
speak
thinking
of
all
this
he
remembered
that
finn
had
sent
for
him
and
had
told
him
to
go
with
his
love
story
to
the
duke
she
had
been
almost
severe
with
him
but
after
the
interview
was
over
he
had
felt
that
she
had
acted
well
and
wisely
he
therefore
determined
that
he
would
go
to
finn
she
had
as
yet
received
no
answer
from
the
duke
though
nearly
a
fortnight
had
elapsed
since
she
had
written
her
letter
during
that
time
she
had
become
very
angry
she
felt
that
he
was
not
treating
her
as
a
gentleman
should
treat
a
lady
and
certainly
not
as
the
husband
of
her
late
friend
should
have
treated
the
friend
of
his
late
wife
she
had
a
proud
consciousness
of
having
behaved
well
to
the
pallisers
and
now
this
head
of
the
pallisers
was
rewarding
her
by
evil
treatment
she
had
been
generous
he
was
ungenerous
she
had
been
honest
he
was
deficient
even
in
that
honesty
for
which
she
had
given
him
credit
and
she
had
been
unable
to
obtain
any
of
that
consolation
which
could
have
come
to
her
from
talking
of
her
wrongs
she
could
not
complain
to
her
husband
because
there
were
reasons
that
made
it
essential
that
her
husband
should
not
quarrel
with
the
duke
she
was
hot
with
indignation
at
the
very
moment
in
which
tregear
was
announced
he
began
by
apologising
for
his
intrusion
and
she
of
course
assured
him
that
he
was
welcome
after
the
liberty
which
i
took
with
you
tregear
i
am
only
too
well
pleased
that
you
should
come
to
see
me
i
am
afraid
he
said
that
i
was
a
little
rough
a
little
warm
but
that
was
to
be
expected
a
gentleman
never
likes
to
be
interfered
with
on
such
a
matter
the
position
was
and
is
difficult
mrs
finn
and
i
am
bound
to
acknowledge
the
very
ready
way
in
which
you
did
what
i
asked
you
to
do
and
now
finn
what
is
to
come
next
ah
something
must
be
done
you
know
of
course
that
the
duke
did
not
receive
me
with
any
great
favour
i
did
not
suppose
he
would
nor
did
i
of
course
he
would
object
to
such
a
marriage
but
a
man
in
these
days
can
not
dictate
to
his
daughter
what
husband
she
should
marry
perhaps
he
can
dictate
to
her
what
husband
she
shall
not
marry
hardly
that
he
may
put
impediments
in
the
way
and
the
duke
will
do
so
but
if
i
am
happy
enough
to
have
won
the
affections
of
his
daughter
so
as
to
make
it
essential
to
her
happiness
that
she
should
become
my
wife
he
will
give
way
what
am
i
to
say
mr
tregear
just
what
you
think
why
should
i
be
made
to
say
what
i
think
on
so
delicate
a
matter
or
of
what
use
would
be
my
thoughts
remember
how
far
i
am
removed
from
her
you
are
his
friend
not
at
all
no
one
less
so
as
she
said
this
she
could
not
hinder
the
colour
from
coming
into
her
face
i
was
her
friend
lady
glencora
but
with
the
death
of
my
friend
there
was
an
end
of
all
that
you
were
staying
with
him
at
his
request
you
told
me
so
yourself
i
shall
never
stay
with
him
again
but
all
that
tregear
is
of
no
matter
i
do
not
mean
to
say
a
word
against
him
not
a
word
but
if
you
wish
to
interest
any
one
as
being
the
duke
friend
then
i
can
assure
you
i
am
the
last
person
in
london
to
whom
you
should
come
i
know
no
one
to
whom
the
duke
is
likely
to
entertain
feelings
so
little
kind
as
towards
me
this
she
said
in
a
peculiarly
solemn
way
that
startled
tregear
but
before
he
could
answer
her
a
servant
entered
the
room
with
a
letter
she
recognised
at
once
the
handwriting
here
was
the
answer
for
which
she
had
been
so
long
waiting
in
silent
expectation
she
could
not
keep
it
unread
till
he
was
gone
will
you
allow
me
a
moment
she
whispered
and
then
she
opened
the
envelope
as
she
read
the
few
words
her
eyes
became
laden
with
tears
they
quite
sufficed
to
relieve
the
injured
pride
which
had
sat
so
heavy
at
her
heart
i
believe
i
did
you
a
wrong
and
therefore
i
ask
your
pardon
it
was
so
like
what
she
had
believed
the
man
to
be
she
could
not
be
longer
angry
with
him
and
yet
the
very
last
words
she
had
spoken
were
words
complaining
of
his
conduct
this
is
from
the
duke
she
said
putting
the
letter
back
into
its
envelope
oh
indeed
it
is
odd
that
it
should
have
come
while
you
were
here
is
it
is
it
about
lady
mary
no
at
least
not
directly
i
perhaps
spoke
more
harshly
about
him
than
i
should
have
done
the
truth
is
i
had
expected
a
line
from
him
and
it
had
not
come
now
it
is
here
but
i
do
not
suppose
i
shall
ever
see
much
of
him
my
intimacy
was
with
her
but
i
would
not
wish
you
to
remember
what
i
said
just
now
if
if
if
what
finn
you
mean
perhaps
if
i
should
ever
be
allowed
to
call
myself
his
it
may
seem
to
you
to
be
arrogant
but
it
is
an
honour
which
i
expect
to
win
faint
heart
you
know
mr
tregear
exactly
one
has
to
tell
oneself
that
very
often
you
will
help
me
certainly
not
she
said
as
though
she
were
much
startled
how
can
i
help
you
by
telling
me
what
i
should
do
i
suppose
if
i
were
to
go
down
to
richmond
i
should
not
be
admitted
if
you
ask
me
i
think
not
not
to
see
lady
mary
lady
cantrip
would
perhaps
see
you
she
is
acting
the
part
of
duenna
as
i
should
do
also
if
lady
mary
were
staying
with
me
you
suppose
that
if
she
were
here
i
would
let
her
see
you
in
my
house
without
her
father
leave
i
suppose
not
certainly
not
and
therefore
i
conceive
that
lady
cantrip
will
not
do
so
either
i
wish
she
were
here
it
would
be
of
no
use
i
should
be
a
dragon
in
guarding
her
i
wish
you
would
let
me
feel
that
you
were
like
a
sister
to
me
in
this
matter
but
i
am
not
your
sister
nor
yet
your
aunt
nor
yet
your
grandmother
what
i
mean
is
that
i
can
not
be
on
your
side
can
you
not
no
tregear
think
how
long
i
have
known
these
other
people
but
just
now
you
said
that
he
was
your
enemy
i
did
say
so
but
as
i
have
unsaid
it
since
you
as
a
gentleman
will
not
remember
my
words
at
any
rate
i
can
not
help
you
in
this
i
shall
write
to
her
it
can
be
nothing
to
me
if
you
write
she
will
show
your
letter
either
to
her
father
or
to
lady
cantrip
but
she
will
read
it
first
i
can
not
tell
how
that
may
be
in
fact
i
am
the
very
last
person
in
the
world
to
whom
you
should
come
for
assistance
in
this
matter
if
i
gave
any
assistance
to
anybody
i
should
be
bound
to
give
it
to
the
duke
i
can
not
understand
that
mrs
finn
nor
can
i
explain
it
but
it
would
be
so
i
shall
always
be
very
glad
to
see
you
and
i
do
feel
that
we
ought
to
be
friends
because
i
took
such
a
liberty
with
you
but
in
this
matter
i
can
not
help
you
when
she
said
this
he
had
to
take
his
leave
it
was
impossible
that
he
should
further
press
his
case
upon
her
though
he
would
have
been
very
glad
to
extract
from
her
some
kindly
word
it
is
such
a
help
in
a
difficulty
to
have
somebody
who
will
express
even
a
hope
that
the
difficulty
is
perhaps
not
invincible
he
had
no
one
to
comfort
him
in
this
matter
there
was
one
dear
friend
as
a
friend
dearer
than
any
other
to
whom
he
might
go
and
who
would
after
some
fashion
bid
him
prosper
mabel
would
encourage
him
she
had
said
that
she
would
do
so
but
in
making
that
promise
she
had
told
him
that
romeo
would
not
have
spoken
of
his
love
for
juliet
to
rosaline
whom
he
had
loved
before
he
saw
juliet
no
doubt
she
had
gone
on
to
tell
him
that
he
might
come
to
her
and
talk
freely
of
his
love
for
lady
mary
but
after
what
had
been
said
before
he
felt
that
he
could
not
do
so
without
leaving
a
sting
behind
when
a
man
love
goes
well
with
him
so
well
as
to
be
in
some
degree
oppressive
to
him
even
by
its
prosperity
when
the
young
lady
has
jumped
into
his
arms
and
the
father
and
mother
have
been
quite
willing
then
he
wants
no
confidant
he
does
not
care
to
speak
very
much
of
the
matter
which
among
his
friends
is
apt
to
become
a
subject
for
raillery
when
you
call
a
man
benedick
he
does
not
come
to
you
with
ecstatic
descriptions
of
the
beauty
and
the
wit
of
his
beatrice
but
no
one
was
likely
to
call
him
benedick
in
reference
to
lady
mary
in
spite
of
his
manner
in
spite
of
his
apparent
this
man
was
very
soft
within
less
than
two
years
back
he
had
been
willing
to
sacrifice
all
the
world
for
his
cousin
mabel
and
his
cousin
mabel
had
told
him
that
he
was
wrong
it
does
not
pay
to
sacrifice
the
world
for
love
so
cousin
mabel
had
said
and
had
added
something
as
to
its
being
necessary
that
she
should
marry
a
rich
man
and
expedient
that
he
should
marry
a
rich
woman
he
had
thought
much
about
it
and
had
declared
to
himself
that
on
no
account
would
he
marry
a
woman
for
her
money
then
he
had
encountered
lady
mary
palliser
there
had
been
no
doubt
no
resolution
after
that
no
thinking
about
it
but
downright
love
there
was
nothing
left
of
real
regret
for
his
cousin
in
his
bosom
she
had
been
right
that
love
had
been
impossible
but
this
would
be
possible
ah
so
deliciously
possible
if
only
her
father
and
mother
would
assist
the
mother
imprudent
in
this
as
in
all
things
had
assented
the
reader
knows
the
rest
it
was
in
every
way
possible
she
will
have
money
enough
the
duchess
had
said
if
only
her
father
can
be
brought
to
give
it
you
so
tregear
had
set
his
heart
upon
it
and
had
said
to
himself
that
the
thing
was
to
be
done
then
his
friend
the
duchess
had
died
and
the
real
difficulties
had
commenced
from
that
day
he
had
not
seen
his
love
or
heard
from
her
how
was
he
to
know
whether
she
would
be
true
to
him
and
where
was
he
to
seek
for
that
sympathy
which
he
felt
to
be
so
necessary
to
him
a
wild
idea
had
come
into
his
head
that
finn
would
be
his
friend
but
she
had
repudiated
him
he
went
straight
home
and
at
once
wrote
to
the
girl
the
letter
was
a
simple
and
as
such
need
not
be
given
here
in
what
sweetest
language
he
could
find
he
assured
her
that
even
though
he
should
never
be
allowed
to
see
her
or
to
hear
from
her
that
still
he
should
cling
to
her
and
then
he
added
this
passage
if
your
love
for
me
be
what
i
think
it
to
be
no
one
can
have
a
right
to
keep
us
apart
pray
be
sure
that
i
shall
not
change
if
you
change
let
me
know
it
but
i
shall
as
soon
expect
the
heavens
to
fall
chapter
xxiv
she
must
be
made
to
obey
lady
mary
palliser
down
at
the
horns
had
as
much
liberty
allowed
to
her
as
is
usually
given
to
young
ladies
in
these
very
free
days
there
was
indeed
no
restriction
placed
upon
her
at
all
had
tregear
gone
down
to
richmond
and
asked
for
the
young
lady
and
had
lady
cantrip
at
the
time
been
out
and
the
young
lady
at
home
it
would
have
depended
altogether
upon
the
young
lady
whether
she
would
have
seen
her
lover
or
not
nevertheless
lady
cantrip
kept
her
eyes
open
and
when
the
letter
came
from
tregear
she
was
aware
that
the
letter
had
come
but
the
letter
found
its
way
into
lady
mary
hands
and
was
read
in
the
seclusion
of
her
own
i
wonder
whether
you
would
mind
reading
that
she
said
very
shortly
afterwards
to
lady
cantrip
what
answer
ought
i
to
make
do
you
think
any
answer
ought
to
be
made
my
dear
oh
yes
i
must
answer
him
would
your
papa
wish
it
i
told
papa
that
i
would
not
promise
not
to
write
to
him
i
think
i
told
him
that
he
should
see
any
letters
that
there
were
but
if
i
show
them
to
you
i
suppose
that
will
do
as
well
you
had
better
keep
your
word
to
him
absolutely
i
am
not
afraid
of
doing
so
if
you
mean
that
i
can
not
bear
to
give
him
pain
but
this
is
a
matter
in
which
i
mean
to
have
my
own
way
mean
to
have
your
own
way
said
lady
cantrip
much
surprised
by
the
determined
tone
of
the
young
lady
certainly
i
do
i
want
you
to
understand
so
much
i
suppose
papa
can
keep
us
from
marrying
for
ever
and
ever
if
he
pleases
but
he
never
will
make
me
say
that
i
will
give
up
tregear
and
if
he
does
not
yield
i
shall
think
him
cruel
why
should
he
wish
to
make
me
unhappy
all
my
life
he
certainly
does
not
wish
that
my
dear
but
he
will
do
it
i
can
not
go
against
your
father
mary
no
i
suppose
not
i
shall
write
to
tregear
and
then
i
will
show
you
what
i
have
written
papa
shall
see
it
too
if
he
pleases
i
will
do
nothing
secret
but
i
will
never
give
up
mr
tregear
lord
cantrip
came
down
to
richmond
that
evening
and
his
wife
told
him
that
in
her
opinion
it
would
be
best
that
the
duke
should
allow
the
young
people
to
marry
and
should
give
them
money
enough
to
live
upon
is
not
that
a
strong
order
asked
the
earl
the
countess
acknowledged
that
it
was
a
strong
order
but
suggested
that
for
the
happiness
of
them
all
it
might
as
well
be
done
at
first
as
at
last
the
next
morning
lady
mary
showed
her
a
copy
of
the
reply
which
she
had
already
sent
to
her
lover
dear
frank
you
may
be
quite
sure
that
i
shall
never
give
you
up
i
will
not
write
more
at
present
because
papa
does
not
wish
me
to
do
so
i
shall
show
papa
your
letter
and
my
answer
your
own
most
affectionate
mary
has
it
gone
asked
the
countess
i
put
it
myself
into
the
pillar
then
lady
cantrip
felt
that
she
had
to
deal
with
a
very
young
lady
indeed
that
afternoon
lady
cantrip
asked
lady
mary
whether
she
might
be
allowed
to
take
the
two
letters
up
to
town
with
the
express
purpose
of
showing
them
to
the
duke
oh
yes
said
mary
i
think
it
would
be
so
much
the
best
give
papa
my
kindest
love
and
tell
him
from
me
that
if
he
wants
to
make
his
poor
little
girl
happy
he
will
forgive
her
and
be
kind
to
her
in
all
this
then
the
countess
made
some
attempt
to
argue
the
matter
there
were
proprieties
high
rank
might
be
a
blessing
or
might
be
the
reverse
as
people
thought
of
it
but
all
men
acknowledged
that
much
was
due
to
it
noblesse
oblige
it
was
often
the
case
in
life
that
women
were
called
upon
by
circumstances
to
sacrifice
their
inclinations
what
right
had
a
gentleman
to
talk
of
marriage
who
had
no
means
these
things
she
said
and
very
many
more
but
it
was
to
no
purpose
the
young
lady
asserted
that
as
the
gentleman
was
a
gentleman
there
need
be
no
question
as
to
rank
and
that
in
regard
to
money
there
need
be
no
difficulty
if
one
of
them
had
sufficient
but
you
have
none
but
what
your
father
may
give
you
said
lady
cantrip
papa
can
give
it
us
without
any
trouble
said
lady
mary
this
child
had
a
clear
idea
of
what
she
thought
to
be
her
own
rights
being
the
child
of
rich
parents
she
had
the
right
to
money
being
a
woman
she
had
a
right
to
a
husband
having
been
born
free
she
had
a
right
to
choose
one
for
herself
having
had
a
man
love
given
to
her
she
had
a
right
to
keep
it
one
does
know
which
she
is
most
like
her
father
or
her
mother
lady
cantrip
said
afterwards
to
her
husband
she
has
his
cool
determination
and
her
obstinacy
she
did
show
the
letters
to
the
duke
and
in
answer
to
a
word
or
two
from
him
explained
that
she
could
not
take
upon
herself
to
debar
her
guest
from
the
use
of
the
post
but
she
will
write
nothing
without
letting
you
know
it
she
ought
to
write
nothing
at
all
what
she
feels
is
much
worse
than
what
she
writes
if
there
were
no
intercourse
she
would
forget
him
ah
i
do
know
said
the
countess
sorrowfully
i
thought
so
once
all
children
are
determined
as
long
as
they
are
allowed
to
have
their
own
way
i
mean
to
say
that
it
is
the
nature
of
her
character
to
be
obstinate
most
girls
are
prone
to
yield
they
have
not
character
enough
to
stand
against
opposition
i
am
not
speaking
now
only
of
affairs
like
this
it
would
be
the
same
with
her
in
any
thing
have
you
not
always
found
it
so
then
he
had
to
acknowledge
to
himself
that
he
had
never
found
out
anything
in
reference
to
his
daughter
character
she
had
been
properly
educated
at
least
he
hoped
so
he
had
seen
her
grow
up
pretty
sweet
affectionate
always
obedient
to
him
the
most
charming
plaything
in
the
world
on
the
few
occasions
in
which
he
had
allowed
himself
to
play
but
as
to
her
actual
disposition
he
had
never
taken
any
trouble
to
inform
himself
she
had
been
left
to
her
mother
as
other
girls
are
left
and
his
sons
had
been
left
to
their
tutors
and
now
he
had
no
control
over
any
of
them
she
must
be
made
to
obey
like
others
he
said
at
last
speaking
through
his
teeth
there
was
something
in
this
which
almost
frightened
lady
cantrip
she
could
not
bear
to
hear
him
say
that
the
girl
must
be
made
to
yield
with
that
spirit
of
despotic
power
under
which
women
were
restrained
in
years
now
passed
if
she
could
have
spoken
her
own
mind
it
would
have
been
to
this
effect
let
us
do
what
we
can
to
lead
her
away
from
this
desire
of
hers
and
in
order
that
we
may
do
so
let
us
tell
her
that
her
marriage
with
tregear
is
out
of
the
question
but
if
we
do
not
succeed
say
in
the
course
of
the
next
twelve
months
let
us
give
way
let
us
make
it
a
matter
of
joy
that
the
young
man
himself
is
so
acceptable
and
that
was
her
idea
and
with
that
she
would
have
indoctrined
the
duke
had
she
been
able
but
his
was
different
she
must
be
made
to
obey
he
said
and
as
he
said
it
he
seemed
to
be
indifferent
as
to
the
sorrow
which
such
enforced
obedience
might
bring
upon
his
child
in
answer
to
this
she
could
only
shake
her
head
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
do
you
think
we
ought
to
yield
not
at
once
certainly
but
at
last
what
can
you
do
duke
if
she
be
as
firm
as
you
can
you
bear
to
see
her
pine
away
in
her
misery
girls
do
not
do
like
that
he
said
girls
like
men
are
very
different
they
generally
will
yield
to
external
influences
english
girls
though
they
become
the
most
loving
wives
in
the
world
do
not
generally
become
so
riven
by
an
attachment
as
to
become
deep
sufferers
when
it
is
disallowed
but
here
i
fear
we
have
to
deal
with
one
who
will
suffer
after
this
fashion
why
should
she
not
be
like
others
it
may
be
so
we
will
try
but
you
see
what
she
says
in
her
letter
to
him
she
writes
as
though
your
authority
were
to
be
nothing
in
that
matter
of
giving
up
in
all
that
she
says
to
me
there
is
the
same
spirit
if
she
is
firm
duke
you
must
yield
never
she
shall
never
marry
him
with
my
sanction
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
and
lady
cantrip
went
her
way
but
the
duke
though
he
could
say
nothing
more
continued
to
think
of
it
hour
after
hour
he
went
down
to
the
house
of
lords
to
listen
to
a
debate
in
which
it
was
intended
to
cover
the
ministers
with
heavy
disgrace
but
the
duke
could
not
listen
even
to
his
own
friends
he
could
listen
to
nothing
as
he
thought
of
the
condition
of
his
children
he
had
been
asked
whether
he
could
bear
to
see
his
girl
suffer
as
though
he
were
indifferent
to
the
sufferings
of
his
child
did
he
not
know
of
himself
that
there
was
no
father
who
would
do
more
for
the
welfare
of
his
daughter
was
he
not
sure
of
the
tenderness
of
his
own
heart
in
all
that
he
was
doing
was
he
governed
by
anything
but
a
sense
of
duty
was
it
personal
pride
or
love
of
personal
aggrandisement
he
thought
that
he
could
assure
himself
that
he
was
open
to
no
such
charge
would
he
not
die
for
her
or
for
them
if
he
could
so
serve
them
surely
this
woman
had
accused
him
most
wrongfully
when
she
had
intimated
that
he
could
see
his
girl
suffer
without
caring
for
it
in
his
indignation
he
determined
for
awhile
that
he
would
remove
her
from
the
custody
of
lady
cantrip
but
then
where
should
he
place
her
he
was
aware
that
his
own
house
would
be
like
a
grave
to
a
girl
just
fit
to
come
out
into
the
world
in
this
coming
autumn
she
must
go
somewhere
with
someone
he
himself
in
his
present
frame
of
mind
would
be
but
a
sorry
travelling
companion
lady
cantrip
had
said
that
the
best
hope
of
escape
would
lie
in
the
prospect
of
another
lover
the
prescription
was
disagreeable
but
it
had
availed
in
the
case
of
his
own
wife
before
he
had
ever
seen
her
as
lady
glencora
mccloskie
she
had
been
desirous
of
giving
herself
and
all
her
wealth
to
one
burgo
fitzgerald
who
had
been
altogether
unworthy
the
duke
could
remember
well
how
a
certain
old
lady
midlothian
had
first
hinted
to
him
that
lady
glencora
property
was
very
large
and
had
then
added
that
the
young
lady
herself
was
very
beautiful
and
he
could
remember
how
his
uncle
the
late
duke
who
had
seldom
taken
much
trouble
in
merely
human
affairs
had
said
a
word
or
two
i
have
heard
a
whisper
about
you
and
lady
glencora
mccloskie
nothing
could
be
better
the
result
had
been
undoubtedly
good
his
cora
and
all
her
money
had
been
saved
from
a
worthless
spendthrift
he
had
found
a
wife
who
he
now
thought
had
made
him
happy
and
she
had
found
at
any
rate
a
respectable
husband
the
idea
when
picked
to
pieces
is
not
a
nice
idea
let
us
look
out
for
a
husband
for
this
girl
so
that
we
may
get
her
married
out
of
the
way
of
her
lover
it
is
not
nice
but
it
had
succeeded
in
one
case
and
why
should
it
not
succeed
in
another
but
how
was
it
to
be
done
who
should
do
it
whom
should
he
select
to
play
the
part
which
he
had
undertaken
in
that
other
arrangement
no
worse
person
could
be
found
than
himself
for
managing
such
an
affair
when
the
idea
had
first
been
raised
he
had
thought
that
lady
cantrip
would
do
it
all
but
now
he
was
angry
with
lady
cantrip
how
was
it
to
be
done
how
should
it
be
commenced
how
had
it
been
commenced
in
his
own
case
he
did
not
in
the
least
know
how
he
had
been
chosen
was
it
possible
that
his
uncle
who
was
the
proudest
man
in
england
should
have
condescended
to
make
a
bargain
with
an
old
dowager
whom
everybody
had
despised
and
in
what
way
had
he
been
selected
no
doubt
he
had
been
known
to
be
the
to
a
dukedom
and
to
ducal
revenues
in
his
case
old
lady
midlothian
had
begun
the
matter
with
him
it
occurred
to
him
that
in
royal
marriages
such
beginnings
are
quite
common
but
who
should
be
the
happy
man
then
he
began
to
count
up
the
requisite
attributes
he
must
be
of
high
rank
and
an
eldest
son
and
the
possessor
of
or
the
heir
to
a
good
estate
he
did
despise
himself
when
he
found
that
he
put
these
things
first
as
a
matter
of
course
nevertheless
he
did
put
them
first
he
was
ejecting
this
other
man
because
he
possessed
none
of
these
attributes
he
hurried
himself
on
to
add
that
the
man
must
be
of
good
character
and
such
as
a
young
girl
might
learn
to
love
but
yet
he
was
aware
that
he
added
these
things
for
his
conscience
sake
tregear
character
was
good
and
certainly
the
girl
loved
him
but
was
it
not
clear
to
all
who
knew
anything
of
such
matters
that
francis
tregear
should
not
have
dared
even
to
think
of
marrying
the
daughter
of
the
duke
of
omnium
who
should
be
the
happy
man
there
were
so
many
who
evidently
were
unfit
young
lord
percival
was
heir
to
a
ruined
estate
and
a
beggared
peerage
lord
glasslough
was
odious
to
all
men
there
were
three
or
four
others
of
whom
he
thought
that
he
knew
some
fatal
objection
but
when
he
remembered
lord
popplecourt
there
seemed
to
be
no
objection
which
need
be
fatal
lord
popplecourt
was
a
young
peer
whose
father
had
died
two
years
since
and
whose
estates
were
large
and
unembarrassed
the
late
lord
who
had
been
a
whig
of
the
old
fashion
had
been
the
duke
friend
they
had
been
at
oxford
and
in
the
house
of
commons
together
and
lord
popplecourt
had
always
been
true
to
his
party
as
to
the
son
the
duke
remembered
to
have
heard
lately
that
he
was
not
given
to
waste
his
money
he
drove
a
coach
about
london
a
good
deal
but
had
as
yet
not
done
anything
very
foolish
he
had
taken
his
degree
at
oxford
thereby
showing
himself
to
be
better
than
silverbridge
he
had
also
taken
his
seat
in
the
house
of
lords
and
had
once
opened
his
mouth
he
had
not
indeed
appeared
often
again
but
at
lord
popplecourt
age
much
legislation
is
not
to
be
expected
from
a
young
peer
then
he
thought
of
the
man
appearance
popplecourt
was
not
specially
attractive
whereas
tregear
was
a
very
handsome
man
but
so
also
had
been
burgo
fitzgerald
almost
abnormally
beautiful
while
he
plantagenet
palliser
as
he
was
then
had
been
quite
as
insignificant
in
appearance
as
lord
popplecourt
lord
popplecourt
might
possibly
do
but
then
how
should
the
matter
be
spoken
of
to
the
young
man
after
all
would
it
not
be
best
that
he
should
trust
lady
cantrip
chapter
xxv
a
family
lord
silverbridge
had
paid
all
his
derby
losses
without
any
difficulty
they
had
not
been
very
heavy
for
a
man
in
his
position
and
the
money
had
come
without
remonstrance
when
asking
for
it
he
was
half
ashamed
of
himself
but
could
still
find
consolation
by
remembering
how
much
worse
had
befallen
many
young
men
whom
he
knew
he
had
never
plunged
in
fact
he
had
made
the
most
prudent
book
in
the
world
and
had
so
managed
affairs
that
even
now
the
horse
which
had
been
beaten
was
worth
more
than
all
he
had
lost
and
paid
this
is
getting
serious
he
had
said
to
his
partner
when
on
making
out
a
rough
account
he
had
brought
the
major
in
a
debtor
to
him
of
more
than
a
thousand
pounds
the
major
had
remarked
that
as
he
was
of
the
horses
his
partner
had
good
security
for
the
money
then
something
of
an
unwritten
arrangement
was
made
the
prime
minister
was
now
one
of
the
favourites
for
the
leger
if
the
horse
won
that
race
there
would
be
money
enough
for
everything
if
that
race
were
lost
then
there
should
be
a
settlement
by
the
transfer
of
the
stud
to
the
younger
partner
he
safe
to
pull
it
off
said
the
major
at
this
time
both
his
sons
were
living
with
the
duke
in
london
it
had
been
found
impracticable
to
send
lord
gerald
back
to
cambridge
the
doors
of
trinity
were
closed
against
him
but
some
interest
had
been
made
in
his
favour
and
he
was
to
be
transferred
to
oxford
all
the
truth
had
been
told
and
there
had
been
a
feeling
that
the
lad
should
be
allowed
another
chance
he
could
not
however
go
to
his
new
alma
mater
till
after
the
long
vacation
in
the
meantime
he
was
to
be
taken
by
a
tutor
down
to
a
cottage
on
dartmoor
and
there
be
made
to
read
with
such
amusement
in
the
meantime
as
might
be
got
from
fishing
and
playing
cricket
with
the
west
devon
county
club
it
is
a
very
bright
for
the
summer
his
brother
had
said
to
him
but
it
better
than
breaking
out
on
the
loose
altogether
you
be
a
credit
to
the
family
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
then
i
give
up
the
borough
to
you
but
mind
you
stick
to
the
liberals
i
made
an
ass
of
myself
however
in
these
early
days
of
june
lord
gerald
had
not
yet
got
his
tutor
though
the
father
and
the
two
young
men
were
living
together
they
did
not
see
very
much
of
each
other
the
duke
breakfasted
at
nine
and
the
repast
was
a
very
simple
one
when
they
failed
to
appear
he
did
not
scold
but
would
simply
be
disappointed
at
dinner
they
never
met
it
was
supposed
that
lord
gerald
passed
his
mornings
in
reading
and
some
little
attempts
were
made
in
that
direction
it
is
to
be
feared
they
did
not
come
to
much
silverbridge
was
very
kind
to
gerald
feeling
an
increased
tenderness
for
him
on
account
of
that
cambridge
mishap
now
they
were
much
together
and
occasionally
by
a
strong
effort
would
grace
their
father
with
their
company
it
was
not
often
that
he
either
reproached
them
or
preached
to
them
though
he
could
not
live
with
them
on
almost
equal
terms
as
some
fathers
can
live
with
their
sons
though
he
could
not
laugh
at
their
fun
or
make
them
laugh
at
his
wit
he
knew
that
it
would
have
been
better
both
for
him
and
them
if
he
had
possessed
this
capacity
though
the
life
which
they
lived
was
distasteful
to
him
though
racehorses
were
an
abomination
to
him
and
the
driving
of
coaches
a
folly
and
a
manifest
waste
of
time
still
he
recognised
these
things
as
being
if
not
necessary
yet
unavoidable
evils
to
gerald
he
would
talk
about
oxford
avoiding
all
allusions
to
past
cambridge
misfortunes
but
in
the
presence
of
silverbridge
whose
oxford
career
had
been
so
peculiarly
unfortunate
he
would
make
no
allusion
to
either
of
the
universities
to
his
eldest
son
he
would
talk
of
parliament
which
of
all
subjects
would
have
been
the
most
congenial
had
they
agreed
in
politics
as
it
was
he
could
speak
more
freely
to
him
on
that
than
any
other
matter
one
thursday
night
as
the
two
brothers
went
to
bed
on
returning
from
the
beargarden
at
a
not
very
late
hour
they
agreed
that
they
would
give
the
governor
a
turn
the
next
morning
by
which
they
meant
that
they
would
drag
themselves
out
of
bed
in
time
to
breakfast
with
him
the
worst
of
it
is
that
he
never
will
let
them
get
anything
to
eat
said
gerald
but
silverbridge
explained
that
he
had
taken
that
matter
into
his
own
hands
and
had
specially
ordered
broiled
salmon
and
stewed
kidneys
he
wo
like
it
you
know
said
gerald
sure
he
thinks
it
wicked
to
eat
anything
but
toasted
bacon
before
lunch
at
a
very
little
after
nine
silverbridge
was
in
the
and
there
found
his
father
i
suppose
gerald
is
not
up
yet
said
the
duke
almost
crossly
oh
yes
he
is
sir
he
be
here
directly
have
you
seen
him
this
morning
no
i
have
seen
him
but
i
know
he
be
here
he
said
he
would
last
night
you
speak
of
it
as
if
it
were
an
undertaking
no
not
that
sir
but
we
are
not
always
quite
up
to
time
no
indeed
you
are
not
perhaps
you
sit
late
at
the
house
sometimes
i
do
said
the
young
member
with
a
feeling
almost
akin
to
shame
as
he
remembered
all
the
hours
spent
at
the
beargarden
i
have
had
gerald
there
in
the
gallery
sometimes
it
is
just
as
well
he
should
know
what
is
being
done
quite
as
well
i
should
wonder
if
he
gets
a
seat
some
day
i
do
know
how
that
may
be
he
wo
change
as
i
have
done
he
stick
to
your
side
indeed
i
think
he
do
better
in
the
house
than
i
shall
he
has
more
gift
of
the
gab
that
is
not
the
first
thing
requisite
i
know
all
that
sir
i
read
your
letter
more
than
once
and
i
showed
it
to
him
there
was
something
sweet
and
pleasant
in
the
young
man
manner
by
which
the
father
could
hardly
not
be
captivated
they
had
now
sat
down
and
the
servant
had
brought
in
the
unusual
accessories
for
a
morning
feast
what
is
all
that
asked
the
duke
gerald
and
i
are
so
awfully
hungry
of
a
morning
said
the
son
apologising
well
it
a
very
good
thing
to
be
hungry
that
is
if
you
can
get
plenty
to
eat
salmon
is
it
i
do
think
i
have
any
myself
kidneys
not
for
me
i
think
i
take
a
bit
of
fried
bacon
i
also
am
hungry
but
not
awfully
hungry
you
never
seem
to
me
to
eat
anything
sir
eating
is
an
occupation
from
which
i
think
a
man
takes
the
more
pleasure
the
less
he
considers
it
a
rural
labourer
who
sits
on
the
with
his
bread
and
cheese
and
an
onion
has
more
enjoyment
out
of
it
than
any
lucullus
but
he
likes
a
good
deal
of
it
i
do
not
think
he
ever
himself
which
lucullus
does
i
have
envied
a
ploughman
his
power
his
dura
ilia
but
never
an
epicure
the
appreciative
skill
of
his
palate
if
gerald
does
not
make
haste
he
will
have
to
exercise
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
upon
that
fish
i
will
leave
a
bit
for
him
sir
and
here
he
is
you
are
twenty
minutes
late
gerald
my
father
says
that
bread
and
cheese
and
onions
would
be
better
for
you
than
salmon
and
stewed
kidneys
no
silverbridge
i
said
no
such
thing
but
that
if
he
were
a
hedger
and
ditcher
the
bread
and
cheese
and
onions
would
be
as
good
i
should
not
mind
trying
them
at
all
said
gerald
only
one
never
does
have
such
things
for
breakfast
last
winter
a
lot
of
us
skated
to
ely
and
we
ate
two
or
three
loaves
of
bread
and
a
whole
cheese
at
a
and
as
for
beer
we
drank
the
public
dry
it
was
because
for
the
time
you
had
been
a
hedger
and
ditcher
proby
was
a
ditcher
i
know
when
he
went
right
through
into
one
of
the
dykes
just
push
on
that
dish
silverbridge
it
no
good
you
having
the
trouble
of
helping
me
times
i
do
think
things
are
a
bit
the
nicer
because
they
cost
a
lot
of
money
i
suppose
that
is
what
you
mean
sir
something
of
that
kind
gerald
not
to
have
money
for
your
wants
that
must
be
troublesome
very
bad
indeed
said
silverbridge
shaking
his
head
wisely
as
a
member
of
parliament
might
do
who
felt
that
something
should
be
done
to
put
down
such
a
lamentable
state
of
things
i
do
complain
said
gerald
no
fellow
ever
had
less
right
to
complain
but
i
never
felt
that
i
had
quite
enough
of
course
it
was
my
own
fault
i
should
say
so
my
boy
but
then
there
are
a
great
many
like
you
let
their
means
be
what
they
may
they
never
have
quite
enough
to
be
in
any
difficulty
with
regard
to
money
to
owe
what
you
can
not
pay
or
even
to
have
to
abstain
from
things
which
you
have
told
yourself
are
necessary
to
yourself
or
to
those
who
depend
on
you
creates
a
feeling
of
meanness
that
is
what
i
have
always
felt
said
silverbridge
i
can
not
bear
to
think
that
i
should
like
to
have
a
thing
and
that
i
can
not
afford
it
you
do
not
quite
understand
me
i
fear
the
only
case
in
which
you
can
be
justified
in
desiring
that
which
you
can
not
afford
is
when
the
thing
is
necessary
as
bread
may
be
or
clothes
as
when
a
fellow
wants
a
lot
of
new
breeches
before
he
has
paid
his
tailor
bill
as
when
a
poor
man
said
the
duke
impressively
may
long
to
give
his
wife
a
new
gown
or
his
children
boots
to
keep
their
feet
from
the
mud
and
snow
then
he
paused
a
moment
but
the
serious
tone
of
his
voice
and
the
energy
of
his
words
had
sent
gerald
headlong
among
his
kidneys
i
say
that
in
such
cases
money
must
be
regarded
as
a
blessing
a
note
will
do
so
much
said
silverbridge
but
beyond
that
it
ought
to
have
no
power
of
conferring
happiness
and
certainly
can
not
drive
away
sorrow
not
though
you
build
palaces
out
into
the
deep
can
that
help
you
you
read
your
horace
i
hope
eodum
quo
dominus
minæ
i
recollect
that
said
gerald
black
care
sits
behind
the
horseman
even
though
he
have
a
groom
riding
after
him
beautiful
with
exquisite
boots
as
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
look
out
into
the
world
i
suppose
you
know
it
as
well
as
anybody
said
silverbridge
who
was
simply
desirous
of
making
himself
pleasant
to
the
dear
old
governor
as
far
as
my
experience
goes
the
happiest
man
is
he
who
being
above
the
troubles
which
money
brings
has
his
hands
the
fullest
of
work
if
i
were
to
name
the
class
of
men
whose
lives
are
spent
with
the
most
thorough
enjoyment
i
think
i
should
name
that
of
barristers
who
are
in
large
practice
and
also
in
parliament
is
it
a
great
grind
sir
asked
silverbridge
a
very
great
grind
as
you
call
it
and
there
may
be
the
grind
and
not
the
success
but
he
had
now
got
up
from
his
seat
at
the
table
and
was
standing
with
his
back
against
the
and
as
he
went
on
with
his
lecture
as
the
word
but
came
from
his
lips
he
struck
the
fingers
of
one
hand
lightly
on
the
palm
of
the
other
as
he
had
been
known
to
do
at
some
happy
flight
of
oratory
in
the
house
of
commons
but
it
is
the
grind
that
makes
the
happiness
to
feel
that
your
hours
are
filled
to
overflowing
that
you
can
barely
steal
minutes
enough
for
sleep
that
the
welfare
of
many
is
entrusted
to
you
that
the
world
looks
on
and
approves
that
some
good
is
always
being
done
to
others
above
all
things
some
good
to
your
country
that
is
happiness
for
myself
i
can
conceive
none
other
books
suggested
gerald
as
he
put
the
last
morsel
of
the
last
kidney
into
his
mouth
yes
books
cicero
and
ovid
have
told
us
that
to
literature
only
could
they
look
for
consolation
in
their
banishment
but
then
they
speak
of
a
remedy
for
sorrow
not
of
a
source
of
joy
no
young
man
should
dare
to
neglect
literature
at
some
period
of
his
life
he
will
surely
need
consolation
and
he
may
be
certain
that
should
he
live
to
be
an
old
man
there
will
be
none
other
except
religion
but
for
that
feeling
of
which
creates
happiness
hard
work
and
hard
work
alone
can
give
it
to
you
books
are
hard
work
themselves
sometimes
said
gerald
as
for
money
continued
the
father
not
caring
to
notice
this
interruption
if
it
be
regarded
in
any
other
light
than
as
a
shield
against
want
as
a
rampart
under
the
protection
of
which
you
may
carry
on
your
battle
it
will
fail
you
i
was
born
a
rich
man
few
people
have
cared
so
little
about
it
as
you
said
the
elder
son
and
you
both
of
you
have
been
born
to
be
rich
this
assertion
did
not
take
the
elder
brother
by
surprise
it
was
a
matter
of
course
but
lord
gerald
who
had
never
as
yet
heard
anything
as
to
his
future
destiny
from
his
father
was
interested
by
the
statement
when
i
think
of
all
this
of
what
constitutes
happiness
i
am
almost
tempted
to
grieve
that
it
should
be
so
if
a
large
fortune
were
really
a
bad
thing
said
gerald
a
man
could
i
suppose
get
rid
of
it
no
it
is
a
thing
of
which
a
man
can
not
get
rid
unless
by
shameful
means
it
is
a
burden
which
he
must
carry
to
the
end
does
anybody
wish
to
get
rid
of
it
as
sindbad
did
of
the
old
man
asked
gerald
pertinaciously
at
any
rate
i
have
enjoyed
the
kidneys
you
assured
us
just
now
that
the
bread
and
cheese
at
ely
were
just
as
good
the
duke
as
he
said
this
looked
as
though
he
knew
that
he
had
taken
all
the
wind
out
of
his
adversary
sails
though
you
add
carriage
to
carriage
you
will
not
be
carried
more
comfortably
a
second
horse
out
hunting
is
a
comfort
said
silverbridge
then
at
any
rate
do
desire
a
third
for
show
but
such
comforts
will
cease
to
be
joys
when
they
become
matters
of
course
that
a
boy
who
does
not
see
a
pudding
once
a
year
should
enjoy
a
pudding
when
it
comes
i
can
understand
but
the
daily
pudding
or
the
pudding
twice
a
day
is
soon
no
more
than
simple
daily
bread
which
will
or
will
not
be
sweet
as
it
shall
or
shall
not
have
been
earned
then
he
went
slowly
to
the
door
but
as
he
stood
with
the
handle
of
it
in
his
hand
he
turned
round
and
spoke
another
word
when
hereafter
gerald
you
may
chance
to
think
of
that
bread
and
cheese
at
ely
always
remember
that
you
had
skated
from
cambridge
the
two
brothers
then
took
themselves
to
some
remote
part
of
the
house
where
arrangements
had
been
made
for
smoking
and
there
they
finished
the
conversation
i
was
very
glad
to
hear
what
he
said
about
you
old
boy
this
of
course
came
from
silverbridge
i
did
quite
understand
him
he
meant
you
to
understand
that
you
would
be
like
other
younger
brothers
then
what
i
have
will
be
taken
from
you
there
is
lots
for
three
or
four
of
us
i
do
agree
that
if
a
fellow
has
as
much
as
he
can
spend
he
ought
not
to
want
anything
more
morton
was
telling
me
the
other
day
something
about
the
settled
estates
i
sat
in
that
office
with
him
all
one
morning
i
could
not
understand
it
all
but
i
observed
that
he
said
nothing
about
the
scotch
property
you
be
a
laird
and
i
wish
you
joy
with
all
my
heart
the
governor
will
tell
you
all
about
it
before
long
going
to
have
two
eldest
sons
what
an
unnatural
piece
of
cruelty
to
me
and
so
unnecessary
why
he
says
that
a
property
is
no
better
than
a
burden
but
i
try
and
bear
it
chapter
xxvi
dinner
at
the
beargarden
the
duke
was
in
the
gallery
of
the
house
of
commons
which
is
devoted
to
the
use
of
peers
and
silverbridge
having
heard
that
his
father
was
there
had
come
up
to
him
it
was
then
about
five
and
the
house
had
settled
down
to
business
prayers
had
been
read
petitions
had
been
presented
and
ministers
had
gone
through
their
course
of
baiting
with
that
equanimity
and
air
of
superiority
which
always
belongs
to
a
occupant
of
the
treasury
bench
the
duke
was
very
anxious
that
his
son
should
attend
to
his
parliamentary
duties
but
he
was
too
proud
a
man
and
too
generous
to
come
to
the
house
as
a
spy
it
was
his
present
habit
always
to
be
in
his
own
place
when
the
lords
were
sitting
and
to
remain
there
while
the
lords
sat
it
was
not
for
many
reasons
an
altogether
satisfactory
occupation
but
it
was
the
best
which
his
life
afforded
him
he
would
never
however
come
across
into
the
other
house
without
letting
his
son
know
of
his
coming
and
lord
silverbridge
had
on
this
occasion
been
on
the
and
had
come
up
to
his
father
at
once
do
let
me
take
you
away
said
the
duke
if
you
are
particularly
interested
in
your
chief
defence
for
sir
timothy
beeswax
was
defending
some
measure
of
legal
reform
in
which
he
was
said
to
have
fallen
into
trouble
i
can
hear
it
up
here
you
know
sir
hardly
if
you
are
talking
to
me
to
tell
the
truth
it
a
matter
i
do
care
much
about
they
got
into
some
mess
as
to
the
number
of
judges
and
what
they
ought
to
do
finn
was
saying
that
they
had
so
arranged
that
there
was
one
judge
who
never
could
possibly
do
anything
if
finn
said
so
it
would
probably
be
so
with
some
little
allowance
for
irish
exaggeration
he
is
a
clever
man
with
less
of
his
country
hyperbole
than
others
but
still
not
without
his
share
you
know
him
well
i
suppose
yes
as
one
man
does
know
another
in
the
political
world
but
he
is
a
friend
of
yours
i
do
mean
an
friend
which
is
great
bosh
but
you
know
him
at
home
oh
yes
certainly
he
has
been
staying
with
me
at
matching
in
public
life
such
intimacies
come
from
politics
you
do
care
very
much
about
him
then
the
duke
paused
a
moment
before
he
answered
yes
i
do
and
in
what
i
said
just
now
perhaps
i
wronged
him
i
have
been
under
obligations
to
finn
in
a
matter
as
to
which
he
behaved
very
well
i
have
found
him
to
be
a
gentleman
if
you
come
across
him
in
the
house
i
would
wish
you
to
be
courteous
to
him
i
have
not
seen
him
since
we
came
from
abroad
i
have
been
able
to
see
nobody
but
if
ever
again
i
should
entertain
my
friends
at
my
table
finn
would
be
one
who
would
always
be
welcome
there
this
he
said
with
a
sadly
serious
air
as
though
wishing
that
his
words
should
be
noted
at
the
present
moment
he
was
remembering
that
he
owed
recompense
to
finn
and
was
making
an
effort
to
pay
the
debt
but
your
leader
is
striking
out
into
unwonted
eloquence
surely
we
ought
to
listen
to
him
sir
timothy
was
a
fluent
speaker
and
when
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
was
possessed
of
great
plenty
of
words
and
he
was
gifted
with
that
peculiar
power
which
enables
a
man
to
have
the
last
word
in
every
encounter
a
power
which
we
are
apt
to
call
repartee
which
is
in
truth
the
readiness
which
comes
from
continual
practice
you
shall
meet
two
men
of
whom
you
shall
know
the
one
to
be
endowed
with
the
brilliancy
of
true
genius
and
the
other
to
be
possessed
of
but
moderate
parts
and
shall
find
the
former
never
able
to
hold
his
own
against
the
latter
in
a
debate
the
man
of
moderate
parts
will
seem
to
be
greater
than
the
man
of
genius
but
this
skill
of
tongue
this
glibness
of
speech
is
hardly
an
affair
of
intellect
at
all
it
is
as
is
style
to
the
writer
not
the
wares
which
he
has
to
take
to
market
but
the
vehicle
in
which
they
may
be
carried
of
what
avail
to
you
is
it
to
have
filled
granaries
with
corn
if
you
can
not
get
your
corn
to
the
consumer
now
sir
timothy
was
a
great
vehicle
but
he
had
not
in
truth
much
corn
to
send
he
could
turn
a
laugh
against
an
adversary
no
man
better
he
could
seize
at
the
moment
every
advantage
which
the
opportunity
might
give
him
the
treasury
bench
on
which
he
sat
and
the
big
box
on
the
table
before
him
were
to
him
fortifications
of
which
he
knew
how
to
use
every
stone
the
cheers
and
the
jeers
of
the
house
had
been
so
measured
by
him
that
he
knew
the
value
and
force
of
every
sound
politics
had
never
been
to
him
a
study
but
to
parliamentary
strategy
he
had
devoted
all
his
faculties
no
one
knew
so
well
as
sir
timothy
how
to
make
arrangements
for
business
so
that
every
detail
should
be
troublesome
to
his
opponents
he
could
foresee
a
month
beforehand
that
on
a
certain
day
a
royal
concert
would
make
the
house
empty
and
would
generously
give
that
day
to
a
less
observant
adversary
he
knew
how
to
blind
the
eyes
of
members
to
the
truth
those
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
house
would
find
themselves
checkmated
by
his
astuteness
when
with
all
their
pieces
on
the
board
there
should
be
none
which
they
could
move
and
this
to
him
was
government
it
was
to
these
purposes
that
he
conceived
that
a
great
statesman
should
devote
himself
parliamentary
management
that
in
his
mind
was
under
this
constitution
of
ours
the
one
act
essential
for
government
in
all
this
he
was
very
great
but
when
it
might
fall
to
his
duty
either
to
suggest
or
to
defend
any
real
piece
of
proposed
legislation
he
was
less
happy
on
this
occasion
he
had
been
driven
to
take
the
matter
in
hand
because
he
had
previously
been
concerned
in
it
as
a
lawyer
he
had
allowed
himself
to
wax
angry
as
he
endeavoured
to
answer
certain
personal
criticisms
now
sir
timothy
was
never
stronger
than
when
he
simulated
anger
his
mock
indignation
was
perhaps
his
most
powerful
weapon
but
real
anger
is
a
passion
which
few
men
can
use
with
judgment
and
now
sir
timothy
was
really
angry
and
condescended
to
speak
of
our
old
friend
phineas
who
had
made
the
onslaught
as
a
bellicose
irishman
there
was
an
story
as
to
our
friend
having
once
been
seduced
into
fighting
a
duel
and
those
who
wished
to
decry
him
sometimes
alluded
to
the
adventure
sir
timothy
had
been
called
to
order
but
the
speaker
had
ruled
that
bellicose
irishman
was
not
beyond
the
latitude
of
parliamentary
animadversion
then
sir
timothy
had
repeated
the
phrase
with
emphasis
and
the
duke
hearing
it
in
the
gallery
had
made
his
remark
as
to
the
unwonted
eloquence
of
his
son
parliamentary
chief
surely
we
ought
to
listen
to
him
said
the
duke
and
for
a
short
time
they
did
listen
sir
timothy
is
not
a
man
i
like
you
know
said
the
son
feeling
himself
obliged
to
apologise
for
his
subjection
to
such
a
chief
i
never
particularly
loved
him
myself
they
say
that
he
is
a
sort
of
necessity
a
conservative
fate
said
the
duke
well
yes
he
is
so
so
awfully
clever
we
all
feel
that
we
could
not
get
on
without
him
when
you
were
in
he
was
one
of
your
party
oh
yes
he
was
one
of
us
i
have
no
right
to
complain
of
you
for
using
him
but
when
you
say
you
could
not
get
on
without
him
does
it
not
occur
to
you
that
should
he
let
us
say
be
taken
up
to
heaven
you
would
have
to
get
on
without
him
then
he
would
be
out
of
the
way
sir
what
you
mean
perhaps
is
that
you
do
not
know
how
to
get
rid
of
him
of
course
i
do
pretend
to
understand
much
about
it
but
they
all
think
that
he
does
know
how
to
keep
the
party
together
i
do
think
we
are
proud
of
him
hardly
that
he
is
awfully
useful
a
man
has
to
look
out
so
sharp
to
be
always
ready
for
those
other
fellows
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
but
i
mean
your
side
i
understand
who
the
other
fellows
are
and
it
is
everybody
who
will
go
through
such
a
grind
a
man
to
do
it
must
be
always
ready
he
has
so
many
little
things
to
think
of
as
far
as
i
can
see
we
all
feel
that
we
could
not
get
along
very
well
without
him
upon
the
whole
the
duke
was
pleased
with
what
he
heard
from
his
son
the
young
man
ideas
about
politics
were
boyish
but
they
were
the
ideas
of
a
boy
silverbridge
had
picked
up
some
of
the
ways
of
the
place
though
he
had
not
yet
formed
any
sound
political
opinions
then
sir
timothy
finished
a
long
speech
with
a
flowery
peroration
in
which
he
declared
that
if
parliament
were
desirous
of
keeping
the
realms
of
her
majesty
free
from
the
invasions
of
foreigners
it
must
be
done
by
maintaining
the
dignity
of
the
judicial
bench
there
were
some
clamours
at
this
and
although
it
was
now
phineas
finn
who
had
been
called
a
bellicose
irishman
was
able
to
say
a
word
or
two
the
right
honourable
gentleman
no
doubt
means
said
phineas
that
we
must
carry
ourselves
with
some
increased
external
dignity
the
world
is
bewigging
itself
and
we
must
buy
a
bigger
wig
than
any
we
have
got
in
order
to
confront
the
world
with
proper
turveydrop
and
deportment
will
suffice
for
us
against
any
odds
about
seven
the
house
became
very
empty
where
are
you
going
to
dine
sir
asked
silverbridge
the
duke
with
something
like
a
sigh
said
he
supposed
he
should
dine
at
home
you
never
were
at
the
beargarden
were
you
sir
asked
silverbridge
suddenly
never
said
the
duke
come
and
dine
with
me
i
am
not
a
member
of
the
club
we
do
care
at
all
about
that
anybody
can
take
in
anybody
does
not
that
make
it
promiscuous
well
no
i
do
know
that
it
does
it
seems
to
go
on
very
well
i
daresay
there
are
some
cads
there
sometimes
but
i
do
know
where
one
does
meet
cads
there
are
plenty
in
the
house
of
commons
there
is
something
in
that
silverbridge
which
makes
me
think
that
you
have
not
realised
the
difference
between
private
and
public
life
in
the
former
you
choose
your
own
associates
and
are
responsible
for
your
choice
in
the
latter
you
are
concerned
with
others
for
the
good
of
the
state
and
though
even
for
the
state
sake
you
would
not
willingly
be
closely
allied
with
those
whom
you
think
dishonest
the
outward
manners
and
fashions
of
life
need
create
no
barriers
i
should
not
turn
up
my
nose
at
the
house
of
commons
because
some
constituency
might
send
them
an
illiterate
shoemaker
but
i
might
probably
find
the
illiterate
shoemaker
an
unprofitable
companion
for
my
private
hours
i
do
think
there
will
be
any
shoemakers
at
the
beargarden
even
if
there
were
i
would
go
and
dine
with
you
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
the
place
where
you
i
suppose
pass
many
hours
i
find
it
a
very
good
shop
to
dine
at
the
place
at
the
house
is
so
stuffy
and
nasty
besides
one
likes
to
get
away
for
a
little
time
certainly
i
never
was
an
advocate
for
living
in
the
house
one
should
always
change
the
atmosphere
then
they
got
into
a
cab
and
went
to
the
club
silverbridge
was
a
little
afraid
of
what
he
was
doing
the
invitation
had
come
from
him
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
and
he
hardly
ventured
to
think
that
his
father
would
accept
it
and
now
he
did
not
quite
know
how
the
duke
would
go
through
the
ceremony
the
other
fellows
would
all
come
and
stare
at
a
man
whom
they
had
all
been
taught
to
regard
as
the
most
of
men
but
he
was
especially
anxious
to
make
things
pleasant
for
his
father
what
shall
i
order
said
the
son
as
he
took
the
duke
into
a
to
wash
his
hands
the
duke
suggested
that
anything
sufficient
for
his
son
would
certainly
be
sufficient
for
him
nothing
especial
occurred
during
the
dinner
which
the
duke
appeared
to
enjoy
very
much
yes
i
think
it
is
very
good
soup
he
said
i
do
think
they
ever
give
me
any
soup
at
home
then
the
son
expressed
his
opinion
that
unless
his
father
looked
about
rather
more
sharply
they
very
soon
would
provide
no
dinner
at
all
remarking
that
experience
had
taught
him
that
the
less
people
demanded
the
more
they
were
sat
upon
the
duke
did
like
his
dinner
or
rather
he
liked
the
feeling
that
he
was
dining
with
his
son
a
report
that
the
duke
of
omnium
was
with
lord
silverbridge
soon
went
round
the
room
and
they
who
were
justified
by
some
previous
acquaintance
came
up
to
greet
him
to
all
who
did
so
he
was
very
gracious
and
was
specially
so
to
lord
popplecourt
who
happened
to
pass
close
by
the
table
i
think
he
is
a
fool
whispered
silverbridge
as
soon
as
popplecourt
had
passed
what
makes
you
think
so
we
thought
him
an
ass
at
eton
he
has
done
pretty
well
however
oh
yes
in
a
way
somebody
has
told
me
that
he
is
a
careful
man
about
his
property
i
believe
he
is
all
that
said
silverbridge
then
i
do
see
why
you
should
think
him
a
fool
to
this
silverbridge
made
no
reply
partly
perhaps
because
he
had
nothing
to
say
but
hindered
also
by
the
coming
in
of
tregear
this
was
an
accident
the
possibility
of
which
had
not
crossed
him
unfortunately
too
the
duke
back
was
turned
so
that
tregear
as
he
walked
up
the
room
could
not
see
who
was
sitting
at
his
table
tregear
coming
up
stood
close
to
the
duke
elbow
before
he
recognised
the
man
and
spoke
some
word
or
two
to
silverbridge
how
do
you
do
tregear
said
the
duke
turning
round
oh
my
lord
i
did
not
know
that
it
was
you
you
hardly
would
i
am
quite
a
stranger
here
silverbridge
and
i
came
up
from
the
house
together
and
he
has
been
hospitable
enough
to
give
me
a
dinner
i
will
tell
you
an
odd
thing
for
a
london
man
tregear
i
have
not
dined
at
a
london
club
for
fifteen
years
before
this
i
hope
you
like
it
sir
said
silverbridge
very
much
indeed
tregear
i
suppose
you
have
to
go
to
your
dinner
now
then
they
went
into
one
of
the
rooms
upstairs
to
have
coffee
the
son
declining
to
go
into
the
and
assuring
his
father
that
he
did
not
in
the
least
care
about
a
cigar
after
dinner
you
would
be
smothered
sir
the
duke
did
as
he
was
bidden
and
went
upstairs
there
was
in
truth
a
strong
reason
for
avoiding
the
publicity
of
the
when
bringing
his
father
to
the
club
he
had
thought
nothing
about
tregear
but
he
had
thought
about
tifto
as
he
entered
he
had
seen
tifto
at
a
table
dining
alone
and
had
bobbed
his
head
at
him
then
he
had
taken
the
duke
to
the
further
end
of
the
room
and
had
trusted
that
fear
would
keep
the
major
in
his
place
fear
had
kept
the
major
in
his
place
when
the
major
learned
who
the
stranger
was
he
had
become
silent
and
reserved
before
the
father
and
son
had
finished
their
dinner
tifto
had
gone
to
his
cigar
and
so
that
danger
was
over
by
george
there
silverbridge
has
got
his
governor
to
dinner
said
tifto
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
looking
round
as
though
he
were
announcing
some
confusion
of
the
heavens
and
earth
why
should
lord
silverbridge
have
his
father
to
dine
with
him
asked
lupton
i
believe
i
know
silverbridge
as
well
as
any
man
and
by
george
it
is
the
very
last
thing
of
the
kind
that
i
should
have
expected
there
have
been
no
end
of
quarrels
there
has
been
no
quarrel
at
all
said
tregear
who
had
then
just
entered
the
room
nothing
on
earth
would
make
silverbridge
quarrel
with
his
father
and
i
think
it
would
break
the
duke
heart
to
quarrel
with
his
son
tifto
endeavoured
to
argue
the
matter
out
but
tregear
having
made
the
assertion
on
behalf
of
his
friend
would
not
allow
himself
to
be
enticed
into
further
speech
nevertheless
there
was
a
good
deal
said
by
others
during
which
the
major
drank
two
glasses
of
in
the
he
had
been
struck
with
awe
by
the
duke
presence
and
had
certainly
no
idea
of
presenting
himself
personally
to
the
great
man
but
bacchus
lent
him
aid
and
when
the
discussion
was
over
and
the
whisky
had
been
swallowed
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
would
go
upstairs
and
ask
to
be
introduced
in
the
meantime
the
duke
and
his
son
were
seated
in
close
conversation
on
one
of
the
upstairs
sofas
it
was
a
rule
at
the
beargarden
that
men
might
smoke
all
over
the
house
except
in
the
but
there
was
one
small
chamber
called
the
library
in
which
the
practice
was
not
often
followed
the
room
was
generally
deserted
and
at
this
moment
the
father
and
son
were
the
only
occupants
a
club
said
the
duke
as
he
sipped
his
coffee
is
a
comfortable
and
economical
residence
a
man
gets
what
he
wants
and
gets
it
cheap
but
it
has
its
drawbacks
you
always
see
the
same
fellows
said
silverbridge
a
man
who
lives
much
at
a
club
is
apt
to
fall
into
a
selfish
mode
of
life
he
is
taught
to
think
that
his
own
comfort
should
always
be
the
first
object
a
man
can
never
be
happy
unless
his
first
objects
are
outside
himself
personal
begets
a
sense
of
meanness
which
sticks
to
a
man
even
when
he
has
got
beyond
all
hope
of
rescue
it
is
for
that
reason
among
others
that
marriage
is
so
desirable
a
man
should
marry
i
suppose
unless
a
man
has
on
his
shoulders
the
burden
of
a
wife
and
children
he
should
i
think
feel
that
he
has
shirked
out
of
school
he
is
not
doing
his
share
of
the
work
of
the
commonwealth
pitt
was
not
married
sir
no
and
a
great
many
other
good
men
have
remained
unmarried
do
you
mean
to
be
another
pitt
i
do
intend
to
be
a
prime
minister
i
would
not
recommend
you
to
entertain
that
ambition
pitt
perhaps
hardly
had
time
for
marriage
you
may
be
more
lucky
i
suppose
i
shall
marry
some
day
i
should
be
glad
to
see
you
marry
early
said
the
duke
speaking
in
a
low
voice
almost
solemnly
but
in
his
quietest
sweetest
tone
of
voice
you
are
peculiarly
situated
though
as
yet
you
are
only
the
heir
to
the
property
and
honours
of
our
family
still
were
you
married
almost
everything
would
be
at
your
disposal
there
is
so
much
which
i
should
only
be
too
ready
to
give
up
to
you
i
ca
bear
to
hear
you
talking
of
giving
up
anything
said
silverbridge
energetically
then
the
father
looked
round
the
room
furtively
and
seeing
that
the
door
was
shut
and
that
they
were
assuredly
alone
he
put
out
his
hand
and
gently
stroked
the
young
man
hair
it
was
almost
a
caress
as
though
he
would
have
said
to
himself
were
he
my
daughter
i
would
kiss
him
there
is
much
i
would
fain
give
up
he
said
if
you
were
a
married
man
the
house
in
carlton
terrace
would
be
fitter
for
you
than
for
me
i
have
disqualified
myself
for
taking
that
part
in
society
which
should
be
filled
by
the
head
of
our
family
you
who
have
inherited
so
much
from
your
mother
would
if
you
married
pleasantly
do
all
that
right
well
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
asked
a
straightforward
question
very
quickly
you
have
never
thought
of
any
one
yet
i
suppose
silverbridge
had
thought
very
much
of
somebody
he
was
quite
aware
that
he
had
almost
made
an
offer
to
lady
mabel
she
certainly
had
not
given
him
any
encouragement
but
the
very
fact
that
she
had
not
done
so
allured
him
the
more
he
did
believe
that
he
was
thoroughly
in
love
with
lady
mabel
she
had
told
him
that
he
was
too
young
but
he
was
older
than
lady
mab
herself
by
a
week
she
was
beautiful
that
was
certain
it
was
acknowledged
by
all
that
she
was
clever
as
for
blood
of
which
he
believed
his
father
thought
much
there
was
perhaps
none
better
in
england
he
had
heard
it
said
of
her
as
he
now
well
remembered
in
his
father
presence
that
she
had
behaved
remarkably
well
in
trying
circumstances
she
had
no
fortune
everybody
knew
that
but
then
he
did
not
want
fortune
would
not
this
be
a
good
opportunity
for
breaking
the
matter
to
his
father
you
have
never
thought
of
any
one
said
the
duke
again
very
sweetly
very
softly
but
i
have
lord
silverbridge
as
he
made
the
announcement
blushed
up
to
the
eyes
then
there
came
over
the
father
something
almost
of
fear
if
he
was
to
be
told
how
would
it
be
if
he
could
not
approve
yes
i
have
said
silverbridge
recovering
himself
if
you
wish
it
i
will
tell
you
who
it
is
nay
my
boy
as
to
that
consult
your
own
feelings
are
you
sure
of
yourself
oh
yes
have
you
spoken
to
her
well
yes
in
part
she
has
not
accepted
me
if
you
mean
that
rather
the
contrary
now
the
duke
would
have
been
very
unwilling
to
say
that
his
son
would
certainly
be
accepted
by
any
girl
in
england
to
whom
he
might
choose
to
offer
his
hand
but
when
the
idea
of
a
doubt
was
suggested
to
him
it
did
seem
odd
that
his
son
should
ask
in
vain
what
other
young
man
was
there
who
could
offer
so
much
and
who
was
at
the
same
time
so
likely
to
be
loved
for
his
own
sake
he
smiled
however
and
was
silent
i
suppose
i
may
as
well
out
with
it
continued
silverbridge
you
know
lady
mabel
grex
lady
mabel
grex
yes
i
know
her
is
there
any
objection
is
she
not
your
senior
no
sir
no
she
is
younger
than
i
am
her
father
is
not
a
man
i
esteem
but
she
has
always
been
so
good
then
the
duke
was
again
silent
have
you
not
heard
that
sir
i
think
i
have
is
not
that
a
great
deal
a
very
great
deal
to
be
good
must
of
all
qualities
be
the
best
she
is
very
beautiful
i
think
so
sir
of
course
she
has
no
money
it
is
not
needed
it
is
not
needed
i
have
no
objection
to
make
if
you
are
sure
of
your
own
mind
i
am
quite
sure
of
that
sir
then
i
will
raise
no
objection
lady
mabel
grex
her
father
i
fear
is
not
a
worthy
man
i
hear
that
he
is
a
gambler
he
is
so
poor
that
makes
it
worse
silverbridge
a
man
who
gambles
because
he
has
money
that
he
can
afford
to
lose
is
to
my
thinking
a
fool
but
he
who
gambles
because
he
has
none
is
well
let
us
hope
the
best
of
him
you
may
give
her
my
love
she
has
not
accepted
me
but
should
she
do
so
you
may
she
almost
rejected
me
but
i
am
not
sure
that
she
was
in
earnest
and
i
mean
to
try
again
just
at
that
moment
the
door
was
opened
and
major
tifto
walked
into
the
room
chapter
xxvii
major
tifto
and
the
duke
i
beg
your
pardon
silverbridge
said
the
major
entering
the
room
but
i
was
looking
for
longstaff
he
is
here
said
silverbridge
who
did
not
wish
to
be
interrupted
by
his
racing
friend
your
father
i
believe
said
tifto
he
was
red
in
the
face
but
was
in
other
respects
perhaps
improved
in
appearance
by
his
liquor
in
his
more
sober
moments
he
was
not
always
able
to
assume
that
appearance
of
equality
with
his
companions
which
it
was
the
ambition
of
his
soul
to
achieve
but
a
second
glass
of
would
always
enable
him
to
cock
his
tail
and
bark
before
the
company
with
all
the
courage
of
my
lady
pug
would
you
do
me
the
great
honour
to
introduce
me
to
his
grace
silverbridge
was
not
prone
to
turn
his
back
upon
a
friend
because
he
was
low
in
the
world
he
had
begun
to
understand
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
by
connecting
himself
with
the
major
but
at
the
club
he
always
defended
his
partner
though
he
not
unfrequently
found
himself
obliged
to
snub
the
major
himself
he
always
countenanced
the
little
master
of
hounds
and
was
true
to
his
own
idea
of
standing
to
a
fellow
nevertheless
he
did
not
wish
to
introduce
his
friend
to
his
father
the
duke
saw
it
all
at
a
glance
and
felt
that
the
introduction
should
be
made
perhaps
said
he
getting
up
from
his
chair
this
is
major
tifto
yes
my
lord
duke
i
am
major
tifto
the
duke
bowed
graciously
my
father
and
i
were
engaged
about
private
matters
said
silverbridge
i
beg
ten
thousand
pardons
exclaimed
the
major
i
did
not
intend
to
intrude
i
think
we
had
done
said
the
duke
pray
sit
down
major
tifto
the
major
sat
down
though
now
i
bethink
myself
i
have
to
beg
your
pardon
that
i
a
stranger
should
ask
you
to
sit
down
in
your
own
club
do
mention
it
my
lord
duke
i
am
so
unused
to
clubs
that
i
forgot
where
i
was
quite
so
my
lord
duke
i
hope
you
think
that
silverbridge
is
looking
well
yes
yes
i
think
so
silverbridge
bit
his
lips
and
turned
his
face
away
to
the
door
we
did
make
a
very
good
thing
of
our
derby
nag
the
other
day
perhaps
your
grace
has
heard
all
that
i
did
hear
that
the
horse
in
which
you
are
both
interested
had
failed
to
win
the
race
yes
he
did
the
prime
minister
we
call
him
your
grace
out
of
compliment
to
a
certain
ministry
which
i
wish
it
was
going
on
instead
of
the
seedy
lot
we
got
in
i
think
my
lord
duke
that
any
one
you
may
ask
will
tell
you
that
i
know
what
running
is
well
i
can
assure
you
your
grace
that
is
that
since
i
seen
i
never
seen
a
fitter
than
him
when
he
got
his
canter
that
morning
it
was
nearly
even
betting
not
that
i
or
silverbridge
were
fools
enough
to
put
on
anything
at
that
rate
but
i
never
saw
a
so
bad
ridden
i
do
mean
to
say
anything
my
lord
duke
against
the
man
but
if
that
fellow
had
been
squared
or
else
was
drunk
or
else
was
off
his
head
that
must
have
won
my
lord
duke
i
do
not
know
anything
about
racing
major
tifto
i
suppose
not
your
grace
but
as
i
and
silverbridge
are
together
in
this
matter
i
thought
i
just
let
your
grace
know
that
we
ought
to
have
had
a
very
good
thing
i
thought
that
perhaps
your
grace
might
like
to
know
that
tifto
you
are
making
an
ass
of
yourself
said
silverbridge
making
an
ass
of
myself
exclaimed
the
major
yes
considerably
i
think
you
are
a
little
hard
upon
your
friend
said
the
duke
with
an
attempt
at
a
laugh
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
he
should
know
how
utterly
indifferent
i
am
to
everything
connected
with
the
turf
i
thought
my
lord
duke
you
might
care
about
learning
how
silverbridge
was
going
on
this
the
poor
little
man
said
almost
with
a
whine
his
partner
roughness
had
knocked
out
of
him
nearly
all
the
courage
which
bacchus
had
given
him
so
i
do
anything
that
interests
him
interests
me
but
perhaps
of
all
his
pursuits
racing
is
the
one
to
which
i
am
least
able
to
lend
an
attentive
ear
that
every
horse
has
a
head
and
that
all
did
have
tails
till
they
were
is
the
extent
of
my
stable
knowledge
very
good
indeed
my
lord
duke
very
good
indeed
ha
ha
ha
all
horses
have
heads
and
all
have
tails
heads
and
tails
upon
my
word
that
is
the
best
thing
i
have
heard
for
a
long
time
i
will
do
myself
the
honour
of
wishing
your
grace
silverbridge
then
he
left
the
room
having
been
made
supremely
happy
by
what
he
considered
to
have
been
the
duke
joke
nevertheless
he
would
remember
the
snubbing
and
would
be
even
with
silverbridge
some
day
did
lord
silverbridge
think
that
he
was
going
to
look
after
his
lordship
and
do
this
always
on
the
square
and
then
be
snubbed
for
doing
it
i
am
very
sorry
that
he
should
have
come
in
to
trouble
you
said
the
son
he
has
not
troubled
me
much
i
do
not
know
whether
he
has
troubled
you
if
you
are
coming
down
to
the
house
again
i
will
walk
with
you
silverbridge
of
course
had
to
go
down
to
the
house
again
and
they
started
together
that
man
did
not
trouble
me
silverbridge
but
the
question
is
whether
such
an
acquaintance
must
not
be
troublesome
to
you
i
not
very
proud
of
him
sir
but
i
think
one
ought
to
be
proud
of
one
friends
he
is
my
friend
in
that
way
at
all
in
what
way
then
he
understands
racing
he
is
the
partner
of
your
pleasure
then
the
man
in
whose
society
you
love
to
enjoy
the
recreation
of
the
it
is
sir
because
he
understands
it
i
thought
that
a
gentleman
on
the
turf
would
have
a
trainer
for
that
purpose
not
a
companion
you
mean
to
imply
that
you
can
save
money
by
leaguing
yourself
with
major
tifto
no
sir
indeed
if
you
associate
with
him
not
for
pleasure
then
it
surely
must
be
for
profit
that
you
should
do
the
former
would
be
to
me
so
surprising
that
i
must
regard
it
as
impossible
that
you
should
do
the
latter
is
i
think
a
reproach
this
he
said
with
no
tone
of
anger
in
his
voice
so
gently
that
silverbridge
at
first
hardly
understood
it
but
gradually
all
that
was
meant
came
in
upon
him
and
he
felt
himself
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
he
is
bad
he
said
at
last
whether
he
be
bad
i
will
not
say
but
i
am
sure
that
you
can
gain
nothing
by
his
companionship
i
will
get
rid
of
him
said
silverbridge
after
a
considerable
pause
i
can
not
do
so
at
once
but
i
will
do
it
it
will
be
better
i
think
tregear
has
been
telling
me
the
same
thing
is
he
objectionable
to
mr
tregear
asked
the
duke
oh
yes
tregear
can
not
bear
him
you
treated
him
a
great
deal
better
than
tregear
ever
does
i
do
not
deny
that
he
is
entitled
to
be
treated
well
but
so
also
is
your
groom
let
us
say
no
more
about
him
and
so
it
is
to
be
mabel
grex
i
did
not
say
so
sir
how
can
i
answer
for
her
only
it
was
so
pleasant
for
me
to
know
that
you
would
approve
if
it
should
come
off
yes
i
will
approve
when
she
has
accepted
you
but
i
do
think
she
will
if
she
should
tell
her
that
i
will
go
to
her
at
once
it
will
be
much
to
have
a
new
daughter
very
much
that
you
should
have
a
wife
where
would
she
like
to
live
oh
sir
we
have
got
as
far
as
that
yet
i
dare
say
not
i
dare
say
not
said
the
duke
gatherum
is
always
thought
to
be
dull
she
would
like
gatherum
i
sure
have
you
asked
her
no
sir
but
nobody
ever
did
like
gatherum
i
suppose
not
and
yet
silverbridge
what
a
sum
of
money
it
cost
i
believe
it
did
all
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
the
duke
no
doubt
was
thinking
of
certain
scenes
passed
at
the
great
house
in
question
which
scenes
had
not
been
delightful
to
him
no
i
do
suppose
she
would
wish
to
live
at
gatherum
the
horns
was
given
expressly
by
my
uncle
to
your
dear
mother
and
i
should
like
mary
to
have
the
place
certainly
you
should
live
among
your
tenantry
i
do
care
so
very
much
for
matching
it
is
the
one
place
you
do
like
sir
however
we
can
manage
all
that
carlton
terrace
i
do
not
particularly
like
but
it
is
a
good
house
and
there
you
should
hang
up
your
hat
when
in
london
when
it
is
settled
let
me
know
at
once
but
if
it
should
never
be
settled
i
will
ask
no
questions
but
if
it
be
settled
tell
me
then
in
palace
yard
he
was
turning
to
go
but
before
he
did
so
he
said
another
word
leaning
on
his
son
shoulder
i
do
not
think
that
mabel
grex
and
major
tifto
would
do
well
together
at
all
there
shall
be
an
end
to
that
sir
god
bless
you
my
boy
said
the
duke
lord
silverbridge
sat
in
the
house
or
to
speak
more
accurately
in
the
of
the
house
for
about
an
hour
thinking
over
all
that
had
passed
between
himself
and
his
father
he
certainly
had
not
intended
to
say
anything
about
lady
mab
but
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
it
had
all
come
out
now
at
any
rate
it
was
decided
for
him
that
he
must
in
set
terms
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
the
scene
which
had
just
occurred
had
made
him
thoroughly
sick
of
major
tifto
he
must
get
rid
of
the
major
and
there
could
be
no
way
of
doing
this
at
once
so
easy
and
so
little
open
to
observation
as
marriage
if
he
were
but
once
engaged
to
mabel
grex
the
dismissal
of
tifto
would
be
quite
a
matter
of
course
he
would
see
lady
mabel
again
on
the
morrow
and
ask
her
in
direct
language
to
be
his
wife
chapter
xxviii
montacute
jones
it
was
known
to
all
the
world
that
montacute
jones
first
great
was
to
come
off
on
wednesday
june
at
roehampton
montacute
jones
who
lived
in
grosvenor
place
and
had
a
country
house
in
gloucestershire
and
a
place
for
young
men
to
shoot
at
in
scotland
also
kept
a
suburban
elysium
at
roehampton
in
order
that
she
might
give
two
every
year
when
it
is
said
that
all
these
costly
luxuries
appertained
to
montacute
jones
it
is
to
be
understood
that
they
did
in
truth
belong
to
jones
of
whom
nobody
heard
much
but
of
jones
that
is
montacute
jones
everybody
heard
a
great
deal
she
was
an
old
lady
who
devoted
her
life
to
the
amusement
of
not
only
her
friends
but
very
many
who
were
not
her
friends
no
doubt
she
was
fond
of
lords
and
countesses
and
worked
very
hard
to
get
round
her
all
the
rank
and
fashion
of
the
day
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
she
was
a
worldly
old
woman
but
no
more
old
woman
lived
in
london
and
everybody
liked
to
be
asked
to
her
on
this
occasion
there
was
to
be
a
considerable
infusion
of
royal
blood
german
belgian
french
spanish
and
of
native
growth
everybody
who
was
asked
would
go
and
everybody
had
been
asked
who
was
anybody
lord
silverbridge
had
been
asked
and
lord
silverbridge
intended
to
be
there
lady
mary
his
sister
could
not
even
be
asked
because
her
mother
was
hardly
more
than
three
months
dead
but
it
is
understood
in
the
world
that
women
mourn
longer
than
men
silverbridge
had
mounted
a
private
hansom
cab
in
which
he
could
be
taken
about
rapidly
and
as
he
said
himself
without
being
shut
up
in
a
coffin
in
this
vehicle
he
had
himself
taken
to
roehampton
purporting
to
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
he
had
not
as
yet
seen
his
sister
since
she
had
been
with
lady
cantrip
he
would
on
this
day
come
back
by
the
horns
he
was
well
aware
that
lady
mab
would
be
at
the
what
place
could
be
better
for
putting
the
question
he
had
to
ask
he
was
by
no
means
so
confident
as
the
heir
to
so
many
good
things
might
perhaps
have
been
without
overdue
entering
through
the
house
into
the
lawn
he
encountered
montacute
jones
who
with
a
seat
behind
her
on
the
terrace
surrounded
by
flowers
was
going
through
the
immense
labour
of
receiving
her
guests
how
very
good
of
you
to
come
all
this
way
lord
silverbridge
to
eat
my
strawberries
how
very
good
of
you
to
ask
me
i
did
not
come
to
eat
your
strawberries
but
to
see
your
friends
you
ought
to
have
said
you
came
to
see
me
you
know
have
you
met
miss
boncassen
yet
the
american
beauty
no
is
she
here
yes
and
she
particularly
wants
to
be
introduced
to
you
you
betray
me
will
you
certainly
not
i
am
as
true
as
steel
she
wanted
she
said
to
see
if
the
eldest
son
of
the
duke
of
omnium
really
did
look
like
any
other
man
then
i
do
want
to
see
her
said
silverbridge
with
a
look
of
vexation
there
you
are
wrong
for
there
was
real
downright
fun
in
the
way
she
said
it
there
they
are
and
i
shall
introduce
you
then
montacute
jones
absolutely
left
her
post
for
a
minute
or
two
and
taking
the
young
lord
down
the
steps
of
the
terrace
did
introduce
him
to
boncassen
who
was
standing
there
amidst
a
crowd
and
to
miss
boncassen
the
daughter
boncassen
was
an
american
who
had
lately
arrived
in
england
with
the
object
of
carrying
out
certain
literary
pursuits
in
which
he
was
engaged
within
the
british
museum
he
was
an
american
who
had
nothing
to
do
with
politics
and
nothing
to
do
with
trade
he
was
a
man
of
wealth
and
a
man
of
letters
and
he
had
a
daughter
who
was
said
to
be
the
prettiest
young
woman
either
in
europe
or
in
america
at
the
present
time
isabel
boncassen
was
certainly
a
very
pretty
girl
i
wish
that
my
reader
would
believe
my
simple
assurance
but
no
such
simple
assurance
was
ever
believed
and
i
doubt
even
whether
any
description
will
procure
for
me
from
the
reader
that
amount
of
faith
which
i
desire
to
achieve
but
i
must
make
the
attempt
general
opinion
generally
considered
miss
boncassen
to
be
small
but
she
was
in
truth
something
above
the
average
height
of
english
women
she
was
slight
without
that
look
of
slimness
which
is
common
to
girls
and
especially
to
american
girls
that
her
figure
was
perfect
the
reader
must
believe
on
my
word
as
any
detailed
description
of
her
arms
feet
bust
and
waist
would
be
altogether
ineffective
her
hair
was
dark
brown
and
plentiful
but
it
added
but
little
to
her
charms
which
depended
on
other
matters
perhaps
what
struck
the
beholder
first
was
the
excessive
brilliancy
of
her
complexion
no
pink
was
ever
pinker
no
alabaster
whiteness
was
ever
more
like
alabaster
but
under
and
around
and
through
it
all
there
was
a
constantly
changing
hue
which
gave
a
vitality
to
her
countenance
which
no
fixed
colours
can
produce
her
eyes
too
were
full
of
life
and
brilliancy
and
even
when
she
was
silent
her
mouth
would
speak
nor
was
there
a
fault
within
the
oval
of
her
face
upon
which
the
hypercritics
of
mature
age
could
set
a
finger
her
teeth
were
excellent
both
in
form
and
colour
but
were
seen
but
seldom
who
does
not
know
that
look
of
ubiquitous
ivory
produced
by
teeth
which
are
too
perfect
in
a
face
which
is
otherwise
poor
her
nose
at
the
base
spread
a
little
so
that
it
was
not
purely
grecian
but
who
has
ever
seen
a
nose
to
be
eloquent
and
expressive
which
did
not
so
spread
it
was
i
think
the
vitality
of
her
countenance
the
way
in
which
she
could
speak
with
every
feature
the
command
which
she
had
of
pathos
of
humour
of
sympathy
of
satire
the
assurance
which
she
gave
by
every
glance
of
her
eye
every
elevation
of
her
brow
every
curl
of
her
lip
that
she
was
alive
to
all
that
was
going
on
it
was
all
this
rather
than
those
feminine
charms
which
can
be
catalogued
and
labelled
that
made
all
acknowledge
that
she
was
beautiful
lord
silverbridge
said
boncassen
speaking
a
little
through
his
nose
i
am
proud
to
make
your
acquaintance
sir
your
father
is
a
man
for
whom
we
in
our
country
have
a
great
respect
i
think
sir
you
must
be
proud
of
such
a
father
oh
yes
no
doubt
said
silverbridge
awkwardly
then
boncassen
continued
his
discourse
with
the
gentlemen
around
him
upon
this
our
friend
turned
to
the
young
lady
have
you
been
long
in
england
miss
boncassen
long
enough
to
have
heard
about
you
and
your
father
she
said
speaking
with
no
slightest
twang
i
hope
you
have
not
heard
any
evil
of
me
well
i
sure
you
ca
have
heard
much
good
i
know
you
did
win
the
derby
you
been
long
enough
to
hear
that
do
you
suppose
we
do
interest
ourselves
about
the
derby
in
new
york
why
when
we
arrived
at
queenstown
i
was
leaning
over
the
taffrail
so
that
i
might
ask
the
first
man
on
board
the
tender
whether
the
prime
minister
had
won
and
he
said
he
had
i
ca
conceive
why
you
of
all
men
should
call
your
horse
by
such
a
name
if
my
father
had
been
president
of
the
united
states
i
think
i
call
a
horse
president
i
did
name
the
horse
i
have
changed
it
but
is
it
not
very
impudent
in
me
to
be
finding
fault
with
you
the
first
time
i
have
ever
seen
you
shall
you
have
a
horse
at
ascot
there
will
be
something
going
i
suppose
nothing
that
i
care
about
lord
silverbridge
had
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
go
to
no
races
with
tifto
before
the
leger
the
leger
would
be
an
affair
of
such
moment
as
to
demand
his
presence
after
that
should
come
the
complete
rupture
between
him
and
tifto
then
there
was
a
movement
among
the
elders
and
lord
silverbridge
soon
found
himself
walking
alone
with
miss
boncassen
it
seemed
to
her
to
be
quite
natural
to
do
so
and
there
certainly
was
no
reason
why
he
should
decline
anything
so
pleasant
it
was
thus
that
he
had
intended
to
walk
with
mabel
grex
only
as
yet
he
had
not
found
her
oh
yes
said
miss
boncassen
when
they
had
been
together
about
twenty
minutes
we
shall
be
here
all
the
summer
and
all
the
fall
and
all
the
winter
indeed
father
means
to
read
every
book
in
the
british
museum
before
he
goes
back
he
have
something
to
do
he
reads
by
steam
and
he
has
two
or
three
young
men
with
him
to
take
it
all
down
and
make
other
books
out
of
it
just
as
you
see
a
lady
take
a
lace
shawl
and
turn
it
all
about
till
she
has
trimmed
a
petticoat
with
it
it
is
the
same
lace
all
through
and
so
i
tell
father
it
the
same
knowledge
but
he
puts
it
where
more
people
will
find
it
the
lady
endeavours
to
do
the
same
with
the
lace
that
depends
on
whether
people
look
up
or
down
father
however
is
a
very
learned
man
you
must
suppose
that
i
am
laughing
at
him
he
is
going
to
write
a
very
learned
book
only
everybody
will
be
dead
before
it
can
be
half
finished
they
still
went
on
together
and
then
he
gave
her
his
arm
and
took
her
into
the
place
where
the
strawberries
and
cream
were
prepared
as
he
was
going
in
he
saw
mabel
grex
walking
with
tregear
and
she
bowed
to
him
pleasantly
and
playfully
is
that
lady
a
great
friend
of
yours
asked
miss
boncassen
a
very
great
friend
indeed
she
is
very
beautiful
and
clever
as
well
and
good
as
gold
dear
me
do
tell
me
who
it
is
that
owns
all
these
qualities
lady
mabel
grex
she
is
daughter
of
lord
grex
that
man
with
her
is
my
particular
friend
his
name
is
frank
tregear
and
they
are
cousins
i
am
so
glad
they
are
cousins
why
glad
because
his
being
with
her
wo
make
you
unhappy
supposing
i
was
in
love
with
her
which
i
am
not
do
you
suppose
it
would
make
me
jealous
to
see
her
with
another
man
in
our
country
it
would
not
a
young
lady
may
walk
about
with
a
young
gentleman
just
as
she
might
with
another
young
lady
but
i
thought
it
was
different
here
do
you
know
judging
by
english
ways
i
believe
i
am
behaving
very
improperly
in
walking
about
with
you
so
long
ought
i
not
to
tell
you
to
go
away
pray
do
not
as
i
am
going
to
stay
here
so
long
i
wish
to
behave
well
to
english
eyes
people
know
who
you
are
and
discount
all
that
if
the
difference
be
very
marked
they
do
for
instance
i
wear
a
hideous
long
bit
of
cloth
over
my
face
in
constantinople
because
i
am
a
woman
but
when
the
discrepancies
are
small
then
they
have
to
be
attended
to
so
i
sha
walk
about
with
you
any
more
oh
yes
you
will
said
silverbridge
who
began
to
think
that
he
liked
walking
about
with
miss
boncassen
certainly
not
there
is
sprottle
he
is
father
secretary
he
will
take
me
back
can
not
i
take
you
back
as
well
as
mr
sprottle
indeed
no
i
am
not
going
to
monopolise
such
a
man
as
you
do
you
think
that
i
do
understand
that
everybody
will
be
making
remarks
upon
the
american
girl
who
wo
leave
the
son
of
the
duke
of
omnium
alone
there
is
your
particular
friend
lady
mabel
and
here
is
my
particular
friend
mr
sprottle
may
i
come
and
call
certainly
father
will
only
be
too
proud
and
i
shall
be
prouder
mother
will
be
the
proudest
of
all
mother
very
seldom
goes
out
till
we
get
a
house
we
are
at
the
langham
thank
you
sprottle
i
think
we
go
and
find
father
lord
silverbridge
found
himself
close
to
lady
mabel
and
tregear
and
also
to
miss
cassewary
who
had
now
joined
lady
mabel
he
had
been
much
struck
with
the
american
beauty
but
was
not
on
that
account
the
less
anxious
to
carry
out
his
great
plan
it
was
essentially
necessary
that
he
should
do
so
at
once
because
the
matter
had
been
settled
between
him
and
his
father
he
was
anxious
to
assure
her
that
if
she
would
consent
then
the
duke
would
be
ready
to
pour
out
all
kinds
of
paternal
blessings
on
their
heads
come
and
take
a
turn
among
the
haycocks
he
said
frank
declares
said
lady
mabel
that
the
hay
is
hired
for
the
occasion
i
wonder
whether
that
is
true
anybody
can
see
said
tregear
that
it
has
not
been
cut
off
the
grass
it
stands
upon
if
i
could
find
montacute
jones
i
ask
her
where
she
got
it
said
lady
mabel
are
you
coming
asked
silverbridge
impatiently
i
do
think
i
am
i
have
been
walking
round
the
haycocks
till
i
am
tired
of
them
anywhere
else
then
there
is
anywhere
else
what
have
you
done
with
your
american
beauty
the
truth
is
lord
silverbridge
you
ask
me
for
my
company
when
she
wo
give
you
hers
any
longer
does
it
look
like
it
miss
cassewary
i
do
think
lord
silverbridge
is
the
man
to
forget
an
old
friend
for
a
new
one
not
though
the
new
friend
be
as
lovely
as
miss
boncassen
i
do
know
that
i
ever
saw
a
prettier
girl
said
tregear
i
quite
admit
it
said
lady
mabel
but
that
is
no
salve
for
my
injured
feelings
i
have
heard
so
much
about
miss
boncassen
beauty
for
the
last
week
that
i
mean
to
get
up
a
company
of
british
females
limited
for
the
express
purpose
of
putting
her
down
who
is
miss
boncassen
that
we
are
all
to
be
put
on
one
side
for
her
of
course
he
knew
that
she
was
joking
but
he
hardly
knew
how
to
take
her
joke
there
is
a
manner
of
joking
which
carries
with
it
much
serious
intention
he
did
feel
that
lady
mabel
was
not
gracious
to
him
because
he
had
spent
half
an
hour
with
this
new
beauty
and
he
was
half
inclined
to
be
angry
with
her
was
it
fitting
that
she
should
be
cross
with
him
seeing
that
he
was
resolved
to
throw
at
her
feet
all
the
good
things
that
he
had
in
the
world
bother
miss
boncassen
he
said
you
might
as
well
come
and
take
a
turn
with
a
fellow
come
along
miss
cassewary
said
she
we
will
go
round
the
haycocks
yet
once
again
so
they
turned
and
the
two
ladies
accompanied
lord
silverbridge
but
this
was
not
what
he
wanted
he
could
not
say
what
he
had
to
say
in
the
presence
of
miss
cassewary
nor
could
he
ask
her
to
take
herself
off
in
another
direction
nor
could
he
take
himself
off
now
that
he
had
joined
himself
to
these
two
ladies
he
must
make
with
them
the
tour
of
the
gardens
all
this
made
him
cross
these
kind
of
things
are
a
great
bore
he
said
i
dare
say
you
would
rather
be
in
the
house
of
commons
or
better
still
at
the
beargarden
you
mean
to
be
when
you
say
that
lady
mab
you
ask
us
to
come
and
walk
with
you
and
then
you
tell
us
that
we
are
bores
i
did
nothing
of
the
kind
i
should
have
thought
that
you
would
be
particularly
pleased
with
yourself
for
coming
here
seeing
that
you
have
made
miss
boncassen
acquaintance
to
be
allowed
to
walk
half
an
hour
alone
with
the
acknowledged
beauty
of
the
two
hemispheres
ought
to
be
enough
even
for
lord
silverbridge
that
is
nonsense
lady
mab
nothing
gives
so
much
zest
to
admiration
as
novelty
a
republican
charmer
must
be
exciting
after
all
the
blasées
habituées
of
the
london
how
can
you
talk
such
nonsense
mabel
said
miss
cassewary
but
it
is
so
i
feel
that
people
must
be
sick
of
seeing
me
i
know
i
am
very
often
sick
of
seeing
them
here
is
something
fresh
and
not
only
unlike
but
so
much
more
lovely
i
quite
acknowledge
that
i
may
be
jealous
but
no
one
can
say
that
i
am
spiteful
i
wish
that
some
republican
adonis
or
apollo
would
crop
up
so
that
we
might
have
our
turn
but
i
do
think
the
republican
gentlemen
are
equal
to
the
republican
ladies
do
you
lord
silverbridge
i
have
thought
about
it
sprottle
for
instance
i
have
not
the
pleasure
of
knowing
mr
sprottle
now
we
been
round
the
haycocks
and
really
lord
silverbridge
i
do
think
we
have
gained
much
by
it
those
forced
marches
never
do
any
good
and
so
they
parted
he
was
thinking
with
a
bitter
spirit
of
the
of
his
morning
work
when
he
again
found
himself
close
to
miss
boncassen
in
the
crowd
of
departing
people
on
the
terrace
mind
you
keep
your
word
she
said
and
then
she
turned
to
her
father
lord
silverbridge
has
promised
to
call
boncassen
will
be
delighted
to
make
his
acquaintance
he
got
into
his
cab
and
was
driven
off
towards
richmond
as
he
went
he
began
to
think
of
the
two
young
women
with
whom
he
had
passed
his
morning
mabel
had
certainly
behaved
badly
to
him
even
if
she
suspected
nothing
of
his
object
did
she
not
owe
it
to
their
friendship
to
be
more
courteous
to
him
than
she
had
been
and
if
she
suspected
that
object
should
she
not
at
any
rate
have
given
him
the
opportunity
or
could
it
be
that
she
was
really
jealous
of
the
american
girl
no
that
idea
he
rejected
instantly
it
was
not
compatible
with
the
innate
modesty
of
his
disposition
but
no
doubt
the
american
girl
was
very
lovely
merely
as
a
thing
to
be
looked
at
she
was
superior
to
mabel
he
did
feel
that
as
to
mere
personal
beauty
she
was
in
truth
superior
to
anything
he
had
ever
seen
before
and
she
was
clever
too
and
whereas
mabel
had
been
both
and
unpleasant
chapter
xxix
the
lovers
meet
lord
silverbridge
found
his
sister
alone
i
particularly
want
you
said
he
to
come
and
call
on
mabel
grex
she
wishes
to
know
you
and
i
am
sure
you
would
like
her
but
i
have
been
out
anywhere
yet
she
said
i
do
feel
as
though
i
wanted
to
go
anywhere
nevertheless
she
was
very
anxious
to
know
lady
mabel
grex
of
whom
she
had
heard
much
a
girl
if
she
has
had
a
former
love
passage
says
nothing
of
it
to
her
new
lover
but
a
man
is
not
so
reticent
frank
tregear
had
perhaps
not
told
her
everything
but
he
had
told
her
something
i
was
very
fond
of
her
very
fond
of
her
he
had
said
and
so
i
am
still
he
had
added
as
you
are
my
love
of
loves
she
is
my
friend
of
friends
lady
mary
had
been
satisfied
by
the
assurance
but
had
become
anxious
to
see
the
friend
of
friends
she
resisted
at
first
her
brother
entreaties
she
felt
that
her
father
in
delivering
her
over
to
the
seclusion
of
the
horns
had
intended
to
preclude
her
from
showing
herself
in
london
she
was
conscious
that
she
was
being
treated
with
cruelty
and
had
a
certain
pride
in
her
martyrdom
she
would
obey
her
father
to
the
letter
she
would
give
him
no
right
to
call
her
conduct
in
question
but
he
and
any
other
to
whom
he
might
entrust
the
care
of
her
should
be
made
to
know
that
she
thought
him
cruel
he
had
his
power
to
which
she
must
submit
but
she
also
had
hers
to
which
it
was
possible
he
might
be
made
to
submit
i
do
not
know
that
papa
would
wish
me
to
go
she
said
but
it
is
just
what
he
would
wish
he
thinks
a
good
deal
about
mabel
why
should
he
think
about
her
at
all
i
ca
exactly
explain
said
silverbridge
but
he
does
if
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
mabel
grex
is
anything
particular
to
you
and
that
papa
approves
of
it
i
will
go
all
round
the
world
to
see
her
but
he
had
not
meant
to
tell
her
this
the
request
had
been
made
at
lady
mabel
instance
when
his
sister
had
spoken
of
her
father
possible
objection
then
he
had
become
eager
in
explaining
the
duke
feeling
not
remembering
that
such
anxiety
might
betray
himself
at
that
moment
lady
cantrip
came
in
and
the
question
was
referred
to
her
she
did
not
see
any
objection
to
such
a
visit
and
expressed
her
opinion
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
that
mary
should
be
taken
out
she
should
begin
to
go
somewhere
said
lady
cantrip
and
so
it
was
decided
on
the
next
friday
he
would
come
down
early
in
his
hansom
and
drive
her
up
to
belgrave
square
then
he
would
take
her
to
carlton
terrace
and
lady
cantrip
carriage
should
pick
her
up
there
and
bring
her
home
he
would
arrange
it
all
what
did
you
think
of
the
american
beauty
asked
lady
cantrip
when
that
was
settled
i
thought
she
was
a
beauty
so
i
perceived
you
had
eyes
for
nobody
else
said
lady
cantrip
who
had
been
at
the
somebody
introduced
her
to
me
and
then
i
had
to
walk
about
the
grounds
with
her
that
the
kind
of
thing
one
always
does
in
those
places
just
so
that
is
what
places
are
meant
for
i
suppose
but
it
was
not
apparently
a
great
infliction
lord
silverbridge
had
to
explain
that
it
was
not
an
infliction
that
it
was
a
privilege
seeing
that
miss
boncassen
was
both
clever
and
lovely
but
that
it
did
not
mean
anything
in
particular
when
he
took
his
leave
he
asked
his
sister
to
go
out
into
the
grounds
with
him
for
a
moment
this
she
did
almost
unwillingly
fearing
that
he
was
about
to
speak
to
her
of
tregear
but
he
had
no
such
purpose
on
his
mind
of
course
you
know
he
began
all
that
was
nonsense
you
were
saying
about
mabel
i
did
not
know
i
was
afraid
you
might
blurt
out
something
before
her
i
should
not
be
so
imprudent
girls
do
make
such
fools
of
themselves
sometimes
they
are
always
thinking
about
people
being
in
love
but
it
is
the
truth
that
my
father
said
to
me
the
other
day
how
very
much
he
liked
what
he
had
heard
of
her
and
that
he
would
like
you
to
know
her
on
that
same
evening
silverbridge
wrote
from
the
beargarden
the
shortest
possible
note
to
lady
mabel
telling
her
what
he
had
arranged
i
and
mary
propose
to
call
in
b
square
on
friday
at
two
i
must
be
early
because
of
the
house
you
will
give
us
lunch
there
was
no
word
of
endearment
none
even
of
those
ordinary
words
which
people
who
hate
each
other
use
to
one
another
but
he
received
the
next
day
at
home
a
much
more
note
from
her
dear
lord
silverbridge
you
are
so
good
you
always
do
just
what
you
think
people
will
like
best
nothing
could
please
me
so
much
as
seeing
your
sister
of
whom
of
course
i
have
heard
very
very
much
there
shall
be
nobody
here
but
miss
cass
yours
most
sincerely
how
i
do
wish
i
were
a
man
his
sister
said
to
him
when
they
were
in
the
hansom
together
you
have
a
great
deal
more
trouble
but
i
have
a
hansom
of
my
own
and
go
where
i
pleased
how
would
you
like
to
be
shut
up
at
a
place
like
the
horns
you
can
go
out
if
you
like
it
not
like
you
papa
thinks
it
the
proper
place
for
me
to
live
in
and
so
i
must
live
there
i
do
think
a
woman
ever
chooses
how
or
where
she
shall
live
herself
you
are
not
going
to
take
up
woman
rights
i
hope
i
think
i
shall
if
i
stay
at
the
horns
much
longer
what
would
papa
say
if
he
heard
that
i
was
going
to
give
a
lecture
at
an
institute
the
governor
has
had
so
many
things
to
bear
that
a
trifle
such
as
that
would
make
but
little
difference
poor
papa
he
was
dreadfully
cut
up
about
gerald
and
then
he
is
so
good
he
said
more
to
me
about
gerald
than
he
ever
did
about
my
own
little
misfortune
at
oxford
but
to
gerald
himself
he
said
almost
nothing
now
he
has
forgiven
me
because
he
thinks
i
am
constant
at
the
house
and
are
you
not
so
much
as
he
thinks
i
do
go
there
for
his
sake
he
has
been
so
good
about
my
changing
sides
i
think
you
were
quite
right
there
i
am
beginning
to
think
i
was
quite
wrong
what
did
it
matter
to
me
i
suppose
it
did
make
papa
unhappy
of
course
it
did
and
then
this
affair
of
yours
as
soon
as
this
was
said
lady
mary
at
once
hardened
her
heart
against
her
father
whether
silverbridge
was
or
was
not
entitled
to
his
own
political
opinions
seeing
that
the
pallisers
had
for
ages
been
known
as
staunch
whigs
and
liberals
might
be
a
matter
for
question
but
that
she
had
a
right
to
her
own
lover
she
thought
that
there
could
be
no
question
as
they
were
sitting
in
the
cab
he
could
hardly
see
her
face
but
he
was
aware
that
she
was
in
some
fashion
arming
herself
against
opposition
i
am
sure
that
this
makes
him
very
unhappy
continued
silverbridge
it
can
not
be
altered
she
said
it
will
have
to
be
altered
nothing
can
alter
it
he
might
die
indeed
or
so
might
i
or
he
might
see
that
it
is
no
good
and
change
his
mind
suggested
silverbridge
of
course
that
is
possible
said
lady
mary
very
curtly
showing
plainly
by
her
manner
that
the
subject
was
one
which
she
did
not
choose
to
discuss
any
further
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
come
to
me
said
lady
mabel
kissing
her
new
acquaintance
i
have
heard
so
much
about
you
and
i
also
of
you
i
you
know
am
one
of
your
brother
stern
mentors
there
are
three
or
four
of
us
determined
to
make
him
a
pattern
young
legislator
miss
cassewary
is
another
only
she
is
not
quite
so
stern
as
i
am
he
ought
to
be
very
much
obliged
but
he
is
not
not
a
bit
are
you
lord
silverbridge
not
so
much
as
i
ought
to
be
perhaps
of
course
there
is
an
opposing
force
there
are
the
and
the
drag
and
major
tifto
no
doubt
you
have
heard
of
major
tifto
the
major
is
the
who
wo
let
christian
go
to
the
strait
gate
i
am
afraid
he
has
read
his
pilgrim
progress
but
we
shall
prevail
lady
mary
and
he
will
get
to
the
beautiful
city
at
last
what
is
the
beautiful
city
he
asked
a
seat
in
the
cabinet
i
suppose
or
that
general
respect
which
a
young
nobleman
achieves
when
he
has
shown
himself
able
to
sit
on
a
bench
for
six
consecutive
hours
without
appearing
to
go
to
sleep
then
they
went
to
lunch
and
lady
mary
did
find
herself
to
be
happy
with
her
new
acquaintance
her
life
since
her
mother
death
had
been
so
sad
that
this
short
escape
from
it
was
a
relief
to
her
now
for
awhile
she
found
herself
almost
gay
there
was
an
easy
liveliness
about
lady
mabel
a
grain
of
humour
and
playfulness
conjoined
which
made
her
feel
at
home
at
once
and
it
seemed
to
her
as
though
her
brother
was
at
home
he
called
the
girl
lady
mab
and
queen
mab
and
once
plain
mabel
and
the
old
woman
he
called
miss
cass
it
surely
she
thought
must
be
the
case
that
lady
mabel
and
her
brother
were
engaged
come
upstairs
into
my
own
room
it
is
nicer
than
this
said
lady
mabel
and
they
went
from
the
into
a
pretty
little
with
which
silverbridge
was
very
well
acquainted
have
you
heard
of
miss
boncassen
mary
said
she
had
heard
something
of
miss
boncassen
great
beauty
everybody
is
talking
about
her
your
brother
met
her
at
montacute
jones
and
was
made
a
conquest
of
instantly
i
was
made
a
conquest
of
at
all
said
silverbridge
then
he
ought
to
have
been
made
a
conquest
of
i
should
be
if
i
were
a
man
i
think
she
is
the
loveliest
person
to
look
at
and
the
nicest
person
to
listen
to
that
i
ever
came
across
we
all
feel
that
as
far
as
this
season
is
concerned
we
are
cut
out
but
we
do
mind
it
so
much
because
she
is
a
foreigner
then
just
as
she
said
this
the
door
was
opened
and
frank
tregear
was
announced
everybody
there
present
knew
as
well
as
does
the
reader
what
was
the
connexion
between
tregear
and
lady
mary
palliser
and
each
knew
that
the
other
knew
it
it
was
therefore
impossible
for
them
not
to
feel
themselves
guilty
among
themselves
the
two
lovers
had
not
seen
each
other
since
they
had
been
together
in
italy
now
they
were
brought
face
to
face
in
this
unexpected
manner
and
nobody
except
tregear
was
at
first
quite
sure
whether
somebody
had
not
done
something
to
arrange
the
meeting
mary
might
naturally
suspect
that
lady
mabel
had
done
this
in
the
interest
of
her
friend
tregear
and
silverbridge
could
not
but
suspect
that
it
was
so
lady
mabel
who
had
never
before
met
the
other
girl
could
hardly
refrain
from
thinking
that
there
had
been
some
underhand
communication
and
miss
cassewary
was
clearly
of
opinion
that
there
had
been
some
understanding
silverbridge
was
the
first
to
speak
halloo
tregear
i
did
know
that
we
were
to
see
you
nor
i
that
i
should
see
you
said
he
then
of
course
there
was
a
shaking
of
hands
all
round
in
the
course
of
which
ceremony
he
came
to
mary
the
last
she
gave
him
her
hand
but
had
not
a
word
to
say
to
him
if
i
had
known
that
you
were
here
he
said
i
should
not
have
come
but
i
need
hardly
say
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
even
in
this
way
then
the
two
girls
were
convinced
that
the
meeting
was
accidental
but
miss
cass
still
had
her
doubts
conversation
became
at
once
very
difficult
tregear
seated
himself
near
but
not
very
near
to
lady
mary
and
made
some
attempt
to
talk
to
both
the
girls
at
once
lady
mabel
plainly
showed
that
she
was
not
at
her
ease
whereas
mary
seemed
to
be
stricken
dumb
by
the
presence
of
her
lover
silverbridge
was
so
much
annoyed
by
a
feeling
that
this
interview
was
a
treason
to
his
father
that
he
sat
cudgelling
his
brain
to
think
how
he
should
bring
it
to
an
end
miss
cassewary
was
dumbfounded
by
the
occasion
she
was
the
one
elder
in
the
company
who
ought
to
see
that
no
wrong
was
committed
she
was
not
directly
responsible
to
the
duke
of
omnium
but
she
was
thoroughly
permeated
by
a
feeling
that
it
was
her
duty
to
take
care
that
there
should
be
no
clandestine
love
meetings
in
lord
grex
house
at
last
silverbridge
jumped
up
from
his
chair
upon
my
word
tregear
i
think
you
had
better
go
said
he
so
do
i
said
miss
cassewary
if
it
is
an
accident
of
course
it
is
an
accident
said
tregear
angrily
looking
round
at
mary
who
blushed
up
to
her
eyes
i
did
not
mean
to
doubt
it
said
the
old
lady
but
as
it
has
occurred
mabel
do
you
think
that
he
had
better
go
he
wo
bite
anybody
miss
cass
she
would
not
have
come
if
she
had
expected
it
said
silverbridge
certainly
not
said
mary
speaking
for
the
first
time
but
now
he
is
here
then
she
stopped
herself
rose
from
the
sofa
sat
down
and
then
rising
again
stepped
up
to
her
lover
who
rose
at
the
same
moment
and
threw
herself
into
his
arms
and
put
up
her
lips
to
be
kissed
this
wo
do
at
all
said
silverbridge
miss
cassewary
clasped
her
hands
together
and
looked
up
to
heaven
she
probably
had
never
seen
such
a
thing
done
before
lady
mabel
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
and
though
in
all
this
there
was
much
to
cause
her
anguish
still
in
her
heart
of
hearts
she
admired
the
brave
girl
who
could
thus
show
her
truth
to
her
lover
now
go
said
mary
through
her
sobs
my
own
one
ejaculated
tregear
yes
yes
yes
always
your
own
go
go
go
she
was
weeping
and
sobbing
as
she
said
this
and
hiding
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
he
stood
for
a
moment
irresolute
and
then
left
the
room
without
a
word
of
adieu
to
any
one
you
have
behaved
very
badly
said
the
brother
she
has
behaved
like
an
angel
said
mabel
throwing
her
arms
round
mary
as
she
spoke
like
an
angel
if
there
had
been
a
girl
whom
you
loved
and
who
loved
you
would
you
not
have
wished
it
would
you
not
have
worshipped
her
for
showing
that
she
was
not
ashamed
of
her
love
i
am
not
a
bit
ashamed
said
mary
and
i
say
that
you
have
no
cause
no
one
knows
him
as
i
do
how
good
he
is
and
how
worthy
immediately
after
that
silverbridge
took
his
sister
away
and
lady
mabel
escaping
from
miss
cass
was
alone
she
loves
him
almost
as
i
have
loved
him
she
said
to
herself
i
wonder
whether
he
can
love
her
as
he
did
me
chapter
xxx
what
came
of
the
meeting
not
a
word
was
said
in
the
cab
as
lord
silverbridge
took
his
sister
to
carlton
terrace
and
he
was
leaving
her
without
any
reference
to
the
scene
which
had
taken
place
when
an
idea
struck
him
that
this
would
be
cruel
mary
he
said
i
was
very
sorry
for
all
that
it
was
not
my
doing
i
suppose
it
was
nobody
doing
but
i
am
very
sorry
that
it
occurred
i
think
that
you
should
have
controlled
yourself
no
she
almost
shouted
i
think
so
no
if
you
mean
by
controlling
myself
holding
my
tongue
he
is
the
man
i
love
whom
i
have
promised
to
marry
but
mary
do
ladies
generally
embrace
their
lovers
in
public
no
nor
should
i
never
did
such
a
thing
in
my
life
before
but
as
he
was
there
i
had
to
show
that
i
was
not
ashamed
of
him
do
you
think
i
should
have
done
it
if
you
all
had
not
been
there
then
again
she
burst
into
tears
he
did
not
quite
know
what
to
make
of
it
mabel
grex
had
declared
that
she
had
behaved
like
an
angel
but
yet
as
he
thought
of
what
he
had
seen
he
shuddered
with
vexation
i
was
thinking
of
the
governor
he
said
he
shall
be
told
everything
that
you
met
tregear
certainly
and
that
i
kissed
him
i
will
do
nothing
that
i
am
ashamed
to
tell
everybody
he
will
be
very
angry
i
can
not
help
it
he
should
not
treat
me
as
he
is
doing
tregear
is
a
gentleman
why
did
he
let
him
come
why
did
you
bring
him
but
it
is
of
no
use
the
thing
is
settled
papa
can
break
my
heart
but
he
can
not
make
me
say
that
i
am
not
engaged
to
mr
tregear
on
that
night
mary
told
the
whole
of
her
story
to
lady
cantrip
there
was
nothing
that
she
tried
to
conceal
i
got
up
she
said
and
threw
my
arms
round
him
is
he
not
all
the
world
to
me
had
it
been
planned
asked
lady
cantrip
no
no
nothing
had
been
planned
they
are
cousins
and
very
intimate
and
he
goes
there
constantly
now
i
want
you
to
tell
papa
all
about
it
lady
cantrip
began
to
think
that
it
had
been
an
evil
day
for
her
when
she
had
agreed
to
take
charge
of
this
very
determined
young
lady
but
she
consented
at
once
to
write
to
the
duke
as
the
girl
was
in
her
hands
she
must
take
care
not
to
lay
herself
open
to
reproaches
as
this
objectionable
lover
had
either
contrived
a
meeting
or
had
met
her
without
contriving
it
was
necessary
that
the
duke
should
be
informed
i
would
rather
you
wrote
the
letter
said
lady
mary
but
pray
tell
him
that
all
along
i
have
meant
him
to
know
all
about
it
till
lady
cantrip
seated
herself
at
her
she
did
not
know
how
great
the
difficulty
would
be
it
can
not
in
any
circumstance
be
easy
to
write
to
a
father
as
to
his
daughter
love
for
an
objectionable
lover
but
the
duke
character
added
much
to
the
severity
of
the
task
and
then
that
embrace
she
knew
that
the
duke
would
be
struck
with
horror
as
he
read
of
such
a
tale
and
she
found
herself
almost
struck
with
horror
as
she
attempted
to
write
it
when
she
came
to
the
point
she
found
she
could
not
write
it
i
fear
there
was
a
good
deal
of
warmth
shown
on
both
sides
she
said
feeling
that
she
was
calumniating
the
man
as
to
whose
warmth
she
had
heard
nothing
it
is
quite
clear
she
added
that
this
is
not
a
passing
fancy
on
her
part
it
was
impossible
that
the
duke
should
be
made
to
understand
exactly
what
had
occurred
that
silverbridge
had
taken
mary
he
did
understand
and
that
they
had
together
gone
to
lord
grex
house
he
understood
also
that
the
meeting
had
taken
place
in
the
presence
of
silverbridge
and
of
lady
mabel
no
doubt
it
was
all
an
accident
lady
cantrip
wrote
how
could
it
be
an
accident
you
had
mary
up
in
town
on
friday
he
said
to
his
son
on
the
following
sunday
morning
yes
sir
and
that
friend
of
yours
came
in
yes
sir
do
you
not
know
what
my
wishes
are
certainly
i
do
but
i
could
not
help
his
coming
you
do
not
suppose
that
anybody
had
planned
it
i
hope
not
it
was
simply
an
accident
such
an
accident
as
must
occur
over
and
over
again
unless
mary
is
to
be
locked
up
who
talks
of
locking
anybody
up
what
right
have
you
to
speak
in
that
way
i
only
meant
that
of
course
they
will
stumble
across
each
other
in
london
i
think
i
will
go
abroad
said
the
duke
he
was
silent
for
awhile
and
then
repeated
his
words
i
think
i
will
go
abroad
not
for
long
i
hope
sir
yes
to
live
there
why
should
i
stay
here
what
good
can
i
do
here
everything
i
see
and
everything
i
hear
is
a
pain
to
me
the
young
man
of
course
could
not
but
go
back
in
his
mind
to
the
last
interview
which
he
had
had
with
his
father
when
the
duke
had
been
so
gracious
and
apparently
so
well
pleased
is
there
anything
else
wrong
except
about
mary
silverbridge
asked
i
am
told
that
gerald
owes
about
fifteen
hundred
pounds
at
cambridge
so
much
as
that
i
knew
he
had
a
few
horses
there
it
is
not
the
money
but
the
absence
of
principle
that
a
young
man
should
have
no
feeling
that
he
ought
to
live
within
certain
prescribed
means
do
you
know
what
you
have
had
from
mr
morton
not
exactly
sir
it
is
different
with
you
but
a
man
let
him
be
who
he
may
should
live
within
certain
means
as
for
your
sister
i
think
she
will
break
my
heart
silverbridge
found
it
to
be
quite
impossible
to
say
anything
in
answer
to
this
are
you
going
to
church
asked
the
duke
i
was
not
thinking
of
doing
so
particularly
do
you
not
ever
go
yes
sometimes
i
will
go
with
you
now
if
you
like
it
sir
i
had
thought
of
going
but
my
mind
is
too
much
harassed
i
do
not
see
why
you
should
not
go
but
silverbridge
though
he
had
been
willing
to
sacrifice
his
morning
to
his
father
for
it
was
i
fear
in
that
way
that
he
had
looked
at
it
did
not
see
any
reason
for
performing
a
duty
which
his
father
himself
omitted
and
there
were
various
matters
also
which
harassed
him
on
the
previous
evening
after
dinner
he
had
allowed
himself
to
back
the
prime
minister
for
the
leger
to
a
very
serious
amount
in
fact
he
had
plunged
and
now
stood
to
lose
some
twenty
thousand
pounds
on
the
doings
of
the
last
night
and
he
had
made
these
bets
under
the
influence
of
major
tifto
it
was
the
remembrance
of
this
after
the
promise
made
to
his
father
that
annoyed
him
the
most
he
was
imbued
with
a
feeling
that
it
behoved
him
as
a
man
to
pull
himself
together
as
he
would
have
said
himself
and
to
live
in
accordance
with
certain
rules
he
could
make
the
rules
easily
enough
but
he
had
never
yet
succeeded
in
keeping
any
one
of
them
he
had
determined
to
sever
himself
from
tifto
and
in
doing
that
had
intended
to
sever
himself
from
affairs
of
the
turf
generally
this
resolution
was
not
yet
a
week
old
it
was
on
that
evening
that
he
had
resolved
that
tifto
should
no
longer
be
his
companion
and
now
he
had
to
confess
to
himself
that
because
he
had
drunk
three
or
four
glasses
of
champagne
he
had
been
induced
by
tifto
to
make
those
wretched
bets
and
he
had
told
his
father
that
he
intended
to
ask
mabel
grex
to
be
his
wife
he
had
so
committed
himself
that
the
offer
must
now
be
made
he
did
not
specially
regret
that
though
he
wished
that
he
had
been
more
reticent
what
a
fool
a
man
is
to
blurt
out
everything
he
said
to
himself
a
wife
would
be
a
good
thing
for
him
and
where
could
he
possibly
find
a
better
wife
than
mabel
grex
in
beauty
she
was
no
doubt
inferior
to
miss
boncassen
there
was
something
about
miss
boncassen
which
made
it
impossible
to
forget
her
but
miss
boncassen
was
an
american
and
on
many
accounts
out
of
the
question
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
he
would
fall
in
love
with
miss
boncassen
but
still
it
seemed
hard
to
him
that
this
intention
of
marriage
should
stand
in
his
way
of
having
a
good
time
with
miss
boncassen
for
a
few
weeks
no
doubt
there
were
objections
to
marriage
it
clipped
a
fellow
wings
but
then
if
he
were
married
he
might
be
sure
that
tifto
would
be
laid
aside
it
was
such
a
great
thing
to
have
got
his
father
assured
consent
to
a
marriage
it
meant
complete
independence
in
money
matters
then
his
mind
ran
away
to
a
review
of
his
father
affairs
it
was
a
genuine
trouble
to
him
that
his
father
should
be
so
unhappy
of
all
the
griefs
which
weighed
upon
the
duke
mind
that
in
reference
to
his
sister
was
the
heaviest
the
money
which
gerald
owed
at
cambridge
would
be
nothing
if
that
other
sorrow
could
be
conquered
nor
had
tifto
and
his
own
extravagance
caused
the
duke
any
incurable
wounds
if
tregear
could
be
got
out
of
the
way
his
father
he
thought
might
be
reconciled
to
other
things
he
felt
very
about
his
father
but
he
had
no
remorse
in
regard
to
his
sister
as
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
speak
very
seriously
to
tregear
he
had
wandered
into
james
park
and
had
lighted
by
this
time
cigarettes
one
after
another
as
he
sat
on
one
of
the
benches
he
was
a
handsome
youth
all
but
six
feet
high
with
light
hair
with
round
blue
eyes
and
with
all
that
aristocratic
look
which
had
belonged
so
peculiarly
to
the
late
duke
but
which
was
less
conspicuous
in
the
present
head
of
the
family
he
was
a
young
man
whom
you
would
hardly
pass
in
a
crowd
without
observing
but
of
whom
you
would
say
after
due
observation
that
he
had
not
as
yet
put
off
all
his
childish
ways
he
now
sat
with
his
legs
stretched
out
with
his
cane
in
his
hands
looking
down
upon
the
water
he
was
trying
to
think
he
worked
hard
at
thinking
but
the
bench
was
hard
and
upon
the
whole
he
was
not
satisfied
with
his
position
he
had
just
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
look
up
tregear
when
tregear
himself
appeared
on
the
path
before
him
tregear
exclaimed
silverbridge
silverbridge
exclaimed
tregear
what
on
earth
makes
you
walk
about
here
on
a
sunday
morning
what
on
earth
makes
you
sit
there
that
i
should
walk
here
which
i
often
do
does
not
seem
to
me
odd
but
that
i
should
find
you
is
marvellous
do
you
often
come
never
was
here
in
my
life
before
i
strolled
in
because
i
had
things
to
think
of
questions
to
be
asked
in
parliament
notices
of
motions
amendments
in
committee
and
that
kind
of
thing
go
on
old
fellow
or
perhaps
major
tifto
has
made
important
revelations
d
major
tifto
with
all
my
heart
said
tregear
sit
down
here
said
silverbridge
as
it
happened
at
the
moment
when
you
came
up
i
was
thinking
of
you
that
was
kind
and
i
was
determined
to
go
to
you
all
this
about
my
sister
must
be
given
up
must
be
given
up
it
can
never
lead
to
any
good
i
mean
that
there
never
can
be
a
marriage
then
he
paused
but
tregear
was
determined
to
hear
him
out
it
is
making
my
father
so
miserable
that
you
would
pity
him
if
you
could
see
him
i
dare
say
i
should
when
i
see
people
unhappy
i
always
pity
them
what
i
would
ask
you
to
think
of
is
this
if
i
were
to
commission
you
to
tell
your
sister
that
everything
between
us
should
be
given
up
would
not
she
be
so
unhappy
that
you
would
have
to
pity
her
she
would
get
over
it
and
so
will
your
father
he
has
a
right
to
have
his
own
opinion
on
such
a
matter
and
so
have
i
and
so
has
she
his
rights
in
this
matter
are
very
clear
and
very
potential
i
am
quite
ready
to
admit
that
we
can
not
marry
for
many
years
to
come
unless
he
will
provide
the
money
you
are
quite
at
liberty
to
tell
him
that
i
say
so
i
have
no
right
to
ask
your
father
for
a
penny
and
i
will
never
do
so
the
power
is
all
in
his
hands
as
far
as
i
know
my
own
purposes
i
shall
not
make
any
immediate
attempt
even
to
see
her
we
did
meet
as
you
saw
the
other
day
by
the
merest
chance
after
that
do
you
think
that
your
sister
wishes
me
to
give
her
up
as
for
supposing
that
girls
are
to
have
what
they
wish
that
is
nonsense
for
young
men
i
suppose
equally
so
life
ought
to
be
a
life
of
no
doubt
perhaps
it
might
be
my
duty
to
retire
from
this
affair
if
by
doing
so
i
should
sacrifice
only
myself
the
one
person
of
whom
i
am
bound
to
think
in
this
matter
is
the
girl
i
love
that
is
just
what
she
would
say
about
you
i
hope
so
in
that
way
you
support
each
other
if
it
were
any
other
man
circumstanced
just
like
you
are
and
any
other
girl
placed
like
mary
you
would
be
the
first
to
say
that
the
man
was
behaving
badly
i
do
like
to
use
hard
language
to
you
but
in
such
a
case
you
would
be
the
first
to
say
of
another
man
that
he
was
looking
after
the
girl
money
silverbridge
as
he
said
this
looked
forward
steadfastly
on
to
the
water
regretting
much
that
cause
for
quarrel
should
have
arisen
but
thinking
that
tregear
would
find
himself
obliged
to
quarrel
but
tregear
after
a
few
moments
silence
having
thought
it
out
determined
that
he
would
not
quarrel
i
think
i
probably
might
he
said
laying
his
hand
on
silverbridge
arm
i
think
i
perhaps
might
express
such
an
opinion
well
then
i
have
to
examine
myself
and
find
out
whether
i
am
guilty
of
the
meanness
which
i
might
perhaps
be
too
ready
to
impute
to
another
i
have
done
so
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
i
am
not
drawn
to
your
sister
by
any
desire
for
her
money
i
did
not
seek
her
because
she
was
a
rich
man
daughter
nor
because
she
is
a
rich
daughter
will
i
give
her
up
she
shall
be
mistress
of
the
occasion
nothing
but
a
word
from
her
shall
induce
me
to
leave
her
but
a
word
from
her
if
it
comes
from
her
own
lips
shall
do
so
then
he
took
his
friend
hand
in
his
and
having
grasped
it
walked
away
without
saying
another
word
chapter
xxxi
miss
boncassen
no
thrice
within
the
next
three
weeks
did
lord
silverbridge
go
forth
to
ask
mabel
to
be
his
wife
but
thrice
in
vain
on
one
occasion
she
would
talk
on
other
things
on
the
second
miss
cassewary
would
not
leave
her
on
the
third
the
conversation
turned
in
a
very
disagreeable
way
on
miss
boncassen
as
to
whom
lord
silverbridge
could
not
but
think
that
lady
mabel
said
some
very
things
it
was
no
doubt
true
that
he
during
the
last
three
weeks
had
often
been
in
miss
boncassen
company
that
he
had
danced
with
her
ridden
with
her
taken
her
to
the
house
of
lords
and
to
the
house
of
commons
and
was
now
engaged
to
attend
upon
her
at
a
up
above
maidenhead
but
mabel
had
certainly
no
right
to
complain
had
he
not
thrice
during
the
same
period
come
there
to
lay
his
coronet
at
her
feet
and
now
at
this
very
moment
was
it
not
her
fault
that
he
was
not
going
through
the
ceremony
i
suppose
she
said
laughing
that
it
is
all
settled
what
is
all
settled
about
you
and
the
american
beauty
i
am
not
aware
that
anything
particular
has
been
settled
then
it
ought
to
be
ought
it
for
her
sake
i
mean
that
is
so
like
an
english
woman
said
lord
silverbridge
because
you
can
not
understand
a
manner
of
life
a
little
different
from
your
own
you
will
impute
evil
i
have
imputed
no
evil
lord
silverbridge
and
you
have
no
right
to
say
so
if
you
mean
to
assert
said
miss
cass
that
the
manners
of
american
young
ladies
are
freer
than
those
of
english
young
ladies
it
is
you
that
are
taking
away
their
characters
i
do
say
it
would
be
at
all
bad
continued
lady
mabel
she
is
a
beautiful
girl
and
very
clever
and
would
make
a
charming
duchess
and
then
it
would
be
such
a
delicious
change
to
have
an
american
duchess
she
would
be
a
duchess
well
countess
with
duchessship
before
her
in
the
remote
future
would
it
be
a
change
miss
cass
oh
decidedly
said
miss
cass
and
very
much
for
the
better
quite
a
case
of
new
blood
you
know
pray
do
suppose
that
i
mean
to
object
everybody
who
talks
about
it
approves
i
have
heard
a
dissentient
voice
only
as
it
has
gone
so
far
and
as
english
people
are
too
stupid
you
know
to
understand
all
these
new
ways
do
you
think
perhaps
no
i
do
think
i
do
think
anything
except
that
you
are
very
then
he
got
up
and
after
making
formal
adieux
to
both
the
ladies
left
the
house
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
lady
mabel
began
to
laugh
but
the
least
apprehensive
ears
would
have
perceived
that
the
laughter
was
affected
miss
cassewary
did
not
laugh
at
all
but
sat
bolt
upright
and
looked
very
serious
upon
my
honour
said
the
younger
lady
he
is
the
most
beautifully
human
being
i
ever
knew
in
my
life
then
i
would
laugh
at
him
how
can
one
help
it
but
of
course
i
do
it
with
a
purpose
what
purpose
i
think
he
is
making
a
fool
of
himself
if
somebody
does
not
interfere
he
will
go
so
far
that
he
will
not
be
able
to
draw
back
without
misbehaving
i
thought
said
miss
cassewary
in
a
very
low
voice
almost
whispering
i
thought
that
he
was
looking
for
a
wife
elsewhere
you
need
not
think
of
that
again
said
lady
mab
jumping
up
from
her
seat
i
had
thought
of
it
too
but
as
i
told
you
before
i
spared
him
he
did
not
really
mean
it
with
me
nor
does
he
mean
it
with
this
american
girl
such
young
men
seldom
mean
they
drift
into
matrimony
but
she
will
not
spare
him
it
would
be
a
national
triumph
all
the
states
would
sing
a
pæan
of
glory
fancy
a
new
york
belle
having
compassed
a
duke
i
do
think
it
possible
it
would
be
too
horrid
i
think
it
quite
possible
as
for
me
i
could
teach
myself
to
think
it
best
as
it
is
were
i
not
so
sure
that
i
should
be
better
for
him
than
so
many
others
but
i
should
love
him
why
not
love
him
he
is
such
a
boy
i
should
always
treat
him
like
a
boy
spoiling
him
and
petting
him
but
never
respecting
him
do
run
away
with
any
idea
that
i
should
refuse
him
from
conscientious
motives
if
he
were
really
to
ask
me
i
too
should
like
to
be
a
duchess
i
should
like
to
bring
all
this
misery
at
home
to
an
end
but
you
did
refuse
him
not
exactly
because
he
never
asked
me
for
the
moment
i
was
weak
and
so
i
let
him
have
another
chance
i
shall
not
have
been
a
good
friend
to
him
if
it
ends
in
his
marrying
this
yankee
lord
silverbridge
went
out
of
the
house
in
a
very
ill
humour
which
however
left
him
when
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
he
found
himself
up
at
maidenhead
with
miss
boncassen
miss
boncassen
at
any
rate
did
not
laugh
at
him
and
then
she
was
so
pleasant
so
full
of
common
sense
and
so
completely
intelligent
i
like
you
she
had
said
because
i
feel
that
you
will
not
think
that
you
ought
to
make
love
to
me
there
is
nothing
i
hate
so
much
as
the
idea
that
a
young
man
and
a
young
woman
ca
be
acquainted
with
each
other
without
some
such
tomfoolery
as
that
this
had
exactly
expressed
his
own
feeling
nothing
could
be
so
pleasant
as
his
intimacy
with
isabel
boncassen
boncassen
seemed
to
be
a
homely
person
with
no
desire
either
to
speak
or
to
be
spoken
to
she
went
out
but
seldom
and
on
those
rare
occasions
did
not
in
any
way
interfere
with
her
daughter
boncassen
filled
a
prouder
situation
everybody
knew
that
miss
boncassen
was
in
england
because
it
suited
boncassen
to
spend
many
hours
in
the
british
museum
but
still
the
daughter
hardly
seemed
to
be
under
control
from
the
father
she
went
alone
where
she
liked
talked
to
those
she
liked
and
did
what
she
liked
some
of
the
young
ladies
of
the
day
thought
that
there
was
a
good
deal
to
be
said
in
favour
of
the
freedom
which
she
enjoyed
there
is
however
a
good
deal
to
be
said
against
it
all
young
ladies
can
not
be
miss
boncassens
with
such
an
assurance
of
admirers
as
to
be
free
from
all
fear
of
loneliness
there
is
a
comfort
for
a
young
lady
in
having
a
to
which
she
may
retreat
in
case
of
need
in
american
circles
where
girls
congregate
without
their
mothers
there
is
a
danger
felt
by
young
men
that
if
a
lady
be
once
taken
in
hand
there
will
be
no
possibility
of
getting
rid
of
her
no
mamma
to
whom
she
may
be
taken
and
under
whose
wings
she
may
be
dropped
my
dear
said
an
old
gentleman
the
other
day
walking
through
an
american
and
addressing
himself
to
a
girl
whom
he
knew
well
my
dear
but
the
girl
bowed
and
passed
on
still
clinging
to
the
arm
of
the
young
man
who
accompanied
her
but
the
old
gentleman
was
cruel
and
possessed
of
a
determined
purpose
my
dear
said
he
again
catching
the
young
man
tight
by
the
collar
and
holding
him
fast
do
be
afraid
i
got
him
he
sha
desert
you
i
hold
him
here
till
you
have
told
me
how
your
father
does
the
young
lady
looked
as
if
she
did
like
it
and
the
sight
of
her
misery
gave
rise
to
a
feeling
that
after
all
mammas
perhaps
may
be
a
comfort
but
in
her
present
phase
of
life
miss
boncassen
suffered
no
misfortune
of
this
kind
it
had
become
a
privilege
to
be
allowed
to
attend
upon
miss
boncassen
and
the
feeling
of
this
privilege
had
been
enhanced
by
the
manner
in
which
lord
silverbridge
had
devoted
himself
to
her
fashion
of
course
makes
fashion
had
not
lord
silverbridge
been
so
very
much
struck
by
the
charm
of
the
young
lady
lords
glasslough
and
popplecourt
would
not
perhaps
have
found
it
necessary
to
run
after
her
as
it
was
even
that
most
unenergetic
of
young
men
dolly
longstaff
was
moved
to
profound
admiration
on
this
occasion
they
were
all
up
the
river
at
maidenhead
boncassen
had
looked
about
for
some
means
of
returning
the
civilities
offered
to
him
and
had
been
instigated
by
montacute
jones
to
do
it
after
this
fashion
there
was
a
magnificent
banquet
spread
in
a
on
the
river
bank
there
were
boats
and
there
was
a
band
and
there
was
a
sward
for
dancing
there
was
and
which
nobody
used
and
better
still
long
shady
secluded
walks
in
which
gentlemen
might
stroll
and
ladies
too
if
they
were
kind
enough
the
whole
thing
had
been
arranged
by
montacute
jones
as
the
day
was
fine
as
many
of
the
old
people
had
abstained
from
coming
as
there
were
plenty
of
young
men
of
the
best
sort
and
as
nothing
had
been
spared
in
reference
to
external
comforts
the
party
promised
to
be
a
success
every
most
lovely
girl
in
london
of
course
was
there
except
lady
mabel
grex
lady
mabel
was
in
the
habit
of
going
everywhere
but
on
this
occasion
she
had
refused
boncassen
invitation
i
do
want
to
see
her
triumphs
she
had
said
to
miss
cass
everybody
went
down
by
railway
of
course
and
innumerable
flies
and
carriages
had
been
provided
to
take
them
to
the
scene
of
action
some
immediately
got
into
boats
and
rowed
themselves
up
from
the
bridge
which
as
the
thermometer
was
standing
at
eighty
in
the
shade
was
an
inconsiderate
proceeding
i
do
think
i
am
quite
up
to
that
said
dolly
longstaff
when
it
was
proposed
to
him
to
take
an
oar
miss
amazon
will
do
it
she
rows
so
well
and
is
so
strong
whereupon
miss
amazon
not
at
all
abashed
did
take
the
oar
and
as
lord
silverbridge
was
on
the
seat
behind
her
with
the
other
oar
she
probably
enjoyed
her
task
what
a
very
nice
sort
of
person
lady
cantrip
is
this
was
said
to
silverbridge
by
that
generally
silent
young
nobleman
lord
popplecourt
the
remark
was
the
more
singular
because
lady
cantrip
was
not
at
the
party
and
the
more
so
again
because
as
silverbridge
thought
there
could
be
but
little
in
common
between
the
countess
who
had
his
sister
in
charge
and
the
young
lord
beside
him
who
was
not
fast
only
because
he
did
not
like
to
risk
his
money
well
yes
i
dare
say
she
is
i
thought
so
peculiarly
i
was
at
that
place
at
richmond
yesterday
the
devil
you
were
what
were
you
doing
at
the
horns
lady
cantrip
grandmother
was
i
do
quite
know
what
she
was
but
something
to
us
i
know
i
got
a
picture
of
her
at
popplecourt
lady
cantrip
wanted
to
ask
me
something
about
it
and
so
i
went
down
i
was
so
glad
to
make
acquaintance
with
your
sister
you
saw
mary
did
you
oh
yes
i
lunched
there
i
to
go
down
and
meet
the
duke
some
day
meet
the
duke
why
not
no
reason
on
earth
only
i
ca
imagine
the
governor
going
to
richmond
for
his
dinner
well
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
i
hope
you
get
on
well
with
him
i
was
so
much
struck
with
your
sister
yes
i
dare
say
said
silverbridge
turning
away
into
the
path
where
he
saw
miss
boncassen
standing
with
some
other
ladies
it
certainly
did
not
occur
to
him
that
popplecourt
was
to
be
brought
forward
as
a
suitor
for
his
sister
hand
i
believe
this
is
the
most
lovely
place
in
the
world
miss
boncassen
said
to
him
we
are
so
much
the
more
obliged
to
you
for
bringing
us
here
we
do
bring
you
you
allow
us
to
come
with
you
and
see
all
that
is
pretty
and
lovely
is
it
not
your
party
father
will
pay
the
bill
i
suppose
as
far
as
that
goes
and
mother
name
was
put
on
the
cards
but
of
course
we
know
what
that
means
it
is
because
you
and
a
few
others
like
you
have
been
so
kind
to
us
that
we
are
able
to
be
here
at
all
everybody
i
should
think
must
be
kind
to
you
i
do
have
a
good
time
pretty
much
but
nowhere
so
good
as
here
i
fear
that
when
i
get
back
i
shall
not
like
new
york
i
have
heard
you
say
miss
boncassen
that
americans
were
more
likeable
than
the
english
have
you
well
yes
i
think
i
have
said
so
and
i
think
it
is
so
i
sooner
have
to
dance
with
a
bank
clerk
in
new
york
than
with
a
bank
clerk
here
do
you
ever
dance
with
bank
clerks
oh
dear
yes
at
least
i
suppose
so
i
dance
with
whoever
comes
up
we
have
got
lords
in
america
you
know
you
have
got
gentlemen
plenty
of
them
but
they
are
not
so
easily
defined
as
lords
i
do
like
lords
do
you
oh
yes
and
ladies
countesses
i
mean
and
women
of
that
sort
your
lady
mabel
grex
is
not
here
why
would
she
come
perhaps
you
did
ask
her
oh
yes
i
did
especially
for
your
sake
she
is
not
my
lady
mabel
grex
said
lord
silverbridge
with
unnecessary
energy
but
she
will
be
what
makes
you
think
that
you
are
devoted
to
her
much
more
to
you
miss
boncassen
that
is
nonsense
lord
silverbridge
not
at
all
it
is
also
untrue
surely
i
must
be
the
best
judge
of
that
myself
not
a
doubt
a
judge
not
only
whether
it
be
true
but
if
true
whether
expedient
or
even
possible
what
did
i
say
to
you
when
we
first
began
to
know
each
other
what
did
you
say
that
i
liked
knowing
you
that
was
frank
enough
that
i
liked
knowing
you
because
i
knew
that
there
would
be
no
tomfoolery
of
then
she
paused
but
he
did
not
quite
know
how
to
go
on
with
the
conversation
at
once
and
she
continued
her
speech
when
you
condescend
to
tell
me
that
you
are
devoted
to
me
as
though
that
were
the
kind
of
thing
that
i
expect
to
have
said
when
i
take
a
walk
with
a
young
man
in
a
wood
is
not
that
the
tomfoolery
of
she
stopped
and
looked
at
him
so
that
he
was
obliged
to
answer
then
why
do
you
ask
me
if
i
am
devoted
to
lady
mabel
would
not
that
be
tomfoolery
too
no
if
i
thought
so
i
would
not
have
asked
the
question
i
did
specially
invite
her
to
come
here
because
i
thought
you
would
like
it
you
have
got
to
marry
somebody
some
day
perhaps
and
why
not
her
if
you
come
to
that
why
not
you
he
felt
himself
to
be
getting
into
deep
waters
as
he
said
this
but
he
had
a
meaning
to
express
if
only
he
could
find
the
words
to
express
it
i
do
say
whether
it
is
tomfoolery
as
you
call
it
or
not
but
whatever
it
is
you
began
it
yes
yes
i
see
you
punish
me
for
my
unpremeditated
impertinence
in
suggesting
that
you
are
devoted
to
lady
mabel
by
the
premeditated
impertinence
of
pretending
to
be
devoted
to
me
stop
a
moment
i
can
not
follow
that
then
she
laughed
i
will
swear
that
i
did
not
intend
to
be
impertinent
i
hope
not
i
am
devoted
to
you
lord
silverbridge
i
think
you
are
stop
stop
do
not
say
it
well
i
wo
not
now
but
there
has
been
no
tomfoolery
may
i
ask
a
question
lord
silverbridge
you
will
not
be
angry
i
would
not
have
you
angry
with
me
i
will
not
be
angry
he
said
are
you
not
engaged
to
marry
lady
mabel
grex
no
then
i
beg
your
pardon
i
was
told
that
you
were
engaged
to
her
and
i
thought
your
choice
was
so
fortunate
so
happy
i
have
seen
no
girl
here
that
i
admire
half
so
much
she
almost
comes
up
to
my
idea
of
what
a
young
woman
should
be
almost
now
i
am
sure
that
if
not
engaged
to
her
you
must
be
in
love
with
her
or
my
praise
would
have
sufficed
though
one
knows
a
lady
mabel
grex
one
may
become
acquainted
with
a
miss
boncassen
there
are
moments
in
which
stupid
people
say
clever
things
obtuse
people
say
sharp
things
and
people
say
things
lord
silverbridge
she
said
i
did
not
expect
that
from
you
expect
what
i
meant
it
simply
i
have
no
doubt
you
meant
it
simply
we
americans
think
ourselves
sharp
but
i
have
long
since
found
out
that
we
may
meet
more
than
our
matches
over
here
i
think
we
will
go
back
mother
means
to
try
to
get
up
a
quadrille
you
will
dance
with
me
i
think
not
i
have
been
walking
with
you
and
i
had
better
dance
with
someone
else
you
can
let
me
have
one
dance
i
think
not
there
will
not
be
many
are
you
angry
with
me
yes
i
am
there
but
as
she
said
this
she
smiled
the
truth
is
i
thought
i
was
getting
the
better
of
you
and
you
turned
round
and
gave
me
a
pat
on
the
head
to
show
me
that
you
could
be
master
when
it
pleased
you
you
have
defended
your
intelligence
at
the
expense
of
your
i
be
shot
if
i
know
what
it
all
means
he
said
just
as
he
was
parting
with
her
chapter
xxxii
miss
boncassen
no
lord
silverbridge
made
up
his
mind
that
as
he
could
not
dance
with
miss
boncassen
he
would
not
dance
at
all
he
was
not
angry
at
being
rejected
and
when
he
saw
her
stand
up
with
dolly
longstaff
he
felt
no
jealousy
she
had
refused
to
dance
with
him
not
because
she
did
not
like
him
but
because
she
did
not
wish
to
show
that
she
liked
him
he
could
understand
that
though
he
had
not
quite
followed
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
her
little
accusations
against
him
she
had
flattered
him
without
any
intention
of
flattery
on
her
part
she
had
spoken
of
his
intelligence
and
had
complained
that
he
had
been
too
sharp
to
her
mabel
grex
when
most
sweet
to
him
when
most
loving
always
made
him
feel
that
he
was
her
inferior
she
took
no
trouble
to
hide
her
conviction
of
his
youthfulness
this
was
anything
but
flattering
miss
boncassen
on
the
other
hand
professed
herself
to
be
almost
afraid
of
him
there
shall
be
no
tomfoolery
of
she
had
said
but
what
if
it
were
not
tomfoolery
at
all
what
if
it
were
good
genuine
earnest
he
certainly
was
not
pledged
to
lady
mabel
as
regarded
his
father
there
would
be
a
difficulty
in
the
first
place
he
had
been
fool
enough
to
tell
his
father
that
he
was
going
to
make
an
offer
to
mabel
grex
and
then
his
father
would
surely
refuse
his
consent
to
a
marriage
with
an
american
stranger
in
such
case
there
would
be
no
unlimited
income
no
immediate
pleasantness
of
magnificent
life
such
as
he
knew
would
be
poured
out
upon
him
if
he
were
to
marry
mabel
grex
as
he
thought
of
this
however
he
told
himself
that
he
would
not
sell
himself
for
money
and
magnificence
he
could
afford
to
be
independent
and
gratify
his
own
taste
just
at
this
moment
he
was
of
opinion
that
isabel
boncassen
would
be
the
sweeter
companion
of
the
two
he
had
sauntered
down
to
the
place
where
they
were
dancing
and
stood
by
saying
a
few
words
to
boncassen
why
are
you
not
dancing
my
lord
she
asked
there
are
enough
without
me
i
guess
you
young
aristocrats
are
never
of
doing
much
with
your
own
arms
and
legs
i
do
know
about
that
polo
you
know
for
the
legs
and
for
the
arms
is
hard
work
enough
but
it
must
always
be
something
and
after
all
it
of
much
account
our
young
men
like
to
have
quite
a
time
at
dancing
it
all
came
through
her
nose
and
she
looked
so
common
what
would
the
duke
say
to
her
or
mary
or
even
gerald
the
father
was
by
no
means
so
objectionable
he
was
a
tall
straight
ungainly
man
who
always
wore
black
clothes
he
had
dark
stiff
short
hair
a
long
nose
and
a
forehead
that
was
both
high
and
broad
ezekiel
boncassen
was
the
very
man
from
his
appearance
for
a
president
of
the
united
states
and
there
were
men
who
talked
of
him
for
that
high
office
that
he
had
never
attended
to
politics
was
supposed
to
be
in
his
favour
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
the
most
learned
man
in
the
states
and
reputation
itself
often
suffices
to
give
a
man
dignity
of
manner
he
too
spoke
through
his
nose
but
the
peculiar
twang
coming
from
a
man
would
be
supposed
to
be
virile
and
incisive
from
a
woman
lord
silverbridge
thought
it
to
be
unbearable
but
as
to
isabel
had
she
been
born
within
the
confines
of
some
lordly
park
in
hertfordshire
she
could
not
have
been
more
completely
free
from
the
abomination
i
am
sorry
that
you
should
not
be
enjoying
yourself
said
boncassen
coming
to
his
wife
relief
nothing
could
have
been
nicer
to
tell
the
truth
i
am
standing
idle
by
way
of
showing
my
anger
against
your
daughter
who
would
not
dance
with
me
i
am
sure
she
would
have
felt
herself
honoured
said
boncassen
who
is
the
gentleman
with
her
asked
the
mother
a
particular
friend
of
mine
dolly
longstaff
dolly
ejaculated
boncassen
everybody
calls
him
so
his
real
name
i
believe
to
be
adolphus
is
he
is
he
just
anybody
asked
the
anxious
mother
he
is
a
very
great
deal
as
people
go
here
everybody
knows
him
he
is
asked
everywhere
but
he
goes
nowhere
the
greatest
compliment
paid
to
you
here
is
his
presence
nay
my
lord
there
are
the
countess
montague
and
the
marchioness
of
capulet
and
lord
tybalt
and
they
go
everywhere
they
are
nobodies
it
is
a
charity
to
even
invite
them
but
to
have
had
dolly
longstaff
once
is
a
triumph
for
life
laws
said
boncassen
looking
hard
at
the
young
man
who
was
dancing
what
has
he
done
he
never
did
anything
in
his
life
i
suppose
he
very
rich
i
do
know
i
should
think
not
i
do
know
anything
about
his
riches
but
i
can
assure
you
that
having
had
him
down
here
will
quite
give
a
character
to
the
day
in
the
meantime
dolly
longstaff
was
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
some
part
of
the
character
assigned
to
him
by
lord
silverbridge
was
true
he
very
rarely
did
go
anywhere
and
yet
was
asked
to
a
great
many
places
he
was
a
young
man
though
not
a
very
young
man
with
a
fortune
of
his
own
and
the
expectation
of
a
future
fortune
few
men
living
could
have
done
less
for
the
world
than
dolly
longstaff
and
yet
he
had
a
position
of
his
own
now
he
had
taken
it
into
his
head
to
fall
in
love
with
miss
boncassen
this
was
an
accident
which
had
probably
never
happened
to
him
before
and
which
had
disturbed
him
much
he
had
known
miss
boncassen
a
week
or
two
before
lord
silverbridge
had
seen
her
having
by
some
chance
dined
out
and
sat
next
to
her
from
that
moment
he
had
become
changed
and
had
gone
hither
and
thither
in
pursuit
of
the
american
beauty
his
passion
having
become
suspected
by
his
companions
had
excited
their
ridicule
nevertheless
he
had
persevered
and
now
he
was
absolutely
dancing
with
the
lady
out
in
the
open
air
if
this
goes
on
your
friends
will
have
to
look
after
you
and
put
you
somewhere
lupton
had
said
to
him
in
one
of
the
intervals
of
the
dance
dolly
had
turned
round
and
scowled
and
suggested
that
if
lupton
would
mind
his
own
affairs
it
would
be
as
well
for
the
world
at
large
at
the
present
crisis
dolly
was
very
much
excited
when
the
dance
was
over
as
a
matter
of
course
he
offered
the
lady
his
arm
and
as
a
matter
of
course
she
accepted
it
you
take
a
turn
wo
you
he
said
it
must
be
a
very
short
turn
she
said
as
i
am
expected
to
make
myself
busy
oh
bother
that
it
bothers
me
but
it
has
to
be
done
you
have
set
everything
going
now
they
begin
dancing
again
without
your
telling
them
i
hope
so
and
i
got
something
i
want
to
say
dear
me
what
is
it
they
were
now
on
a
path
close
to
the
riverside
in
which
there
were
many
loungers
would
you
mind
coming
up
to
the
temple
he
said
what
temple
oh
such
a
beautiful
place
the
temple
of
the
winds
i
think
they
call
it
or
venus
or
or
arthur
de
bever
was
she
a
goddess
it
is
something
built
to
her
memory
such
a
view
of
the
river
i
was
here
once
before
and
they
took
me
up
there
everybody
who
comes
here
goes
and
sees
arthur
de
bever
they
ought
to
have
told
you
let
us
go
then
said
miss
boncassen
only
it
must
not
be
long
five
minutes
will
do
it
all
then
he
walked
rather
quickly
up
a
flight
of
rural
steps
lovely
spot
is
it
yes
indeed
that
maidenhead
bridge
that
somebody
place
and
now
got
something
to
say
to
you
you
not
going
to
murder
me
now
you
got
me
up
here
alone
said
miss
boncassen
laughing
murder
you
said
dolly
throwing
himself
into
an
attitude
that
was
intended
to
express
devoted
affection
oh
no
i
am
glad
of
that
miss
boncassen
longstaff
if
you
sigh
like
that
you
burst
yourself
i
what
burst
yourself
and
she
nodded
her
head
at
him
then
he
clapped
his
hands
together
and
turned
his
head
away
from
her
towards
the
little
temple
i
wonder
whether
she
knows
what
love
is
he
said
as
though
he
were
addressing
himself
to
arthur
de
bever
no
she
do
said
miss
boncassen
but
i
do
he
shouted
turning
back
towards
her
i
do
if
any
man
were
ever
absolutely
actually
really
in
love
i
am
the
man
are
you
indeed
longstaff
is
it
pleasant
pleasant
pleasant
oh
it
could
be
so
pleasant
but
who
is
the
lady
perhaps
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
mean
to
say
you
do
know
have
the
least
idea
in
life
let
me
tell
you
then
that
it
could
only
be
one
person
it
never
was
but
one
person
it
never
could
have
been
but
one
person
it
is
you
then
he
put
his
hand
well
on
his
heart
me
said
miss
boncassen
choosing
to
be
ungrammatical
in
order
that
he
might
be
more
absurd
of
course
it
is
you
do
you
think
that
i
should
have
brought
you
all
the
way
up
here
to
tell
you
that
i
was
in
love
with
anybody
else
i
thought
i
was
brought
to
see
de
somebody
and
the
view
not
at
all
said
dolly
emphatically
then
you
have
deceived
me
i
will
never
deceive
you
only
say
that
you
will
love
me
and
i
will
be
as
true
to
you
as
the
north
pole
is
that
true
to
me
you
know
what
i
mean
but
if
i
do
love
you
yes
you
do
do
i
i
beg
your
pardon
said
dolly
i
did
mean
to
say
that
of
course
a
man
should
make
sure
of
a
thing
not
in
this
case
longstaff
because
really
i
entertain
no
such
feeling
but
you
can
if
you
please
just
let
me
tell
you
who
i
am
that
will
do
no
good
whatever
mr
longstaff
let
me
tell
you
at
any
rate
i
have
a
very
good
income
of
my
own
as
it
is
money
can
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
but
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
can
afford
it
you
might
perhaps
have
thought
that
i
wanted
your
money
i
will
attribute
nothing
evil
to
you
longstaff
only
it
is
quite
out
of
the
question
that
i
should
respond
as
i
suppose
you
wish
me
to
and
therefore
pray
do
not
say
anything
further
she
went
to
the
head
of
the
little
steps
but
he
interrupted
her
you
ought
to
hear
me
he
said
i
have
heard
you
i
can
give
you
as
good
a
position
as
any
man
without
a
title
in
england
longstaff
i
rather
fancy
that
wherever
i
may
be
i
can
make
a
position
for
myself
at
any
rate
i
shall
not
marry
with
the
view
of
getting
one
if
my
husband
were
an
english
duke
i
should
think
myself
nothing
unless
i
was
something
as
isabel
boncassen
when
she
said
this
she
did
not
bethink
herself
that
lord
silverbridge
would
in
the
course
of
nature
become
an
english
duke
but
the
allusion
to
an
english
duke
told
intensely
on
dolly
who
had
suspected
that
he
had
a
noble
rival
english
dukes
are
so
easily
got
he
said
very
likely
not
i
might
have
expressed
my
meaning
better
had
i
said
an
english
prince
that
quite
out
of
the
question
said
dolly
they
ca
do
it
by
act
of
parliament
except
in
a
way
that
would
suit
you
at
all
longstaff
you
must
forgive
me
if
i
say
that
of
all
the
gentlemen
i
have
ever
met
in
this
country
or
in
any
other
you
are
the
most
obtuse
this
she
brought
out
in
little
disjointed
sentences
not
with
any
hesitation
but
in
a
way
to
make
every
word
she
uttered
more
clear
to
an
intelligence
which
she
did
not
believe
to
be
bright
but
in
this
belief
she
did
some
injustice
to
dolly
he
was
quite
alive
to
the
disgrace
of
being
called
obtuse
and
quick
enough
to
avenge
himself
at
the
moment
am
i
said
he
how
you
must
be
when
you
think
me
a
fool
because
i
have
fallen
in
love
with
such
a
one
as
yourself
i
like
you
for
that
she
replied
laughing
and
withdraw
the
epithet
as
not
being
applicable
now
we
are
quits
and
can
forget
and
forgive
only
let
there
be
the
forgetting
never
said
dolly
with
his
hand
again
on
his
heart
then
let
it
be
a
little
dream
of
your
youth
that
you
once
met
a
pretty
american
girl
who
was
foolish
enough
to
refuse
all
that
you
would
have
given
her
so
pretty
so
awfully
pretty
thereupon
she
curtsied
i
have
seen
all
the
handsome
women
in
england
going
for
the
last
ten
years
and
there
has
not
been
one
who
has
made
me
think
that
it
would
be
worth
my
while
to
get
off
my
perch
for
her
and
now
you
would
desert
your
perch
for
me
i
have
already
but
you
can
get
up
again
let
it
be
all
a
dream
i
know
men
like
to
have
had
such
dreams
and
in
order
that
the
dream
may
be
pleasant
the
last
word
between
us
shall
be
kind
such
admiration
from
such
a
one
as
you
is
an
honour
and
i
will
reckon
it
among
my
honours
but
it
can
be
no
more
than
a
dream
then
she
gave
him
her
hand
it
shall
be
so
shall
it
not
then
she
paused
it
must
be
so
mr
longstaff
must
it
that
and
no
more
now
i
wish
to
go
down
will
you
come
with
me
it
will
be
better
do
you
think
it
is
going
to
rain
dolly
looked
up
at
the
clouds
i
wish
it
would
with
all
my
heart
i
know
you
are
not
so
it
would
spoil
all
you
have
spoiled
all
no
no
i
have
spoiled
nothing
it
will
only
be
a
little
dream
about
strange
american
girl
who
really
did
make
me
feel
queer
for
half
an
hour
look
at
that
a
great
big
drop
and
the
cloud
has
come
over
us
as
black
as
erebus
do
hurry
down
he
was
leading
the
way
what
shall
we
do
for
carriages
to
get
us
to
the
inn
there
the
it
will
hold
about
half
of
us
and
think
what
it
will
be
to
be
in
there
waiting
till
the
rain
shall
be
over
everybody
has
been
so
and
now
they
will
be
so
cross
the
rain
was
falling
in
big
heavy
drops
slow
and
far
between
but
almost
black
with
their
size
and
the
heaviness
of
the
cloud
which
had
gathered
over
them
made
everything
black
will
you
have
my
arm
said
silverbridge
who
saw
miss
boncassen
scudding
along
with
dolly
longstaff
following
as
fast
as
he
could
oh
dear
no
i
have
got
to
mind
my
dress
there
i
have
gone
right
into
a
puddle
oh
dear
so
she
ran
on
and
silverbridge
followed
close
behind
her
leaving
dolly
longstaff
in
the
distance
it
was
not
only
miss
boncassen
who
got
her
feet
into
a
puddle
and
splashed
her
stockings
many
did
so
who
were
not
obliged
by
their
position
to
maintain
under
their
misfortunes
the
storm
had
come
on
with
such
unexpected
quickness
that
there
had
been
a
general
stampede
to
the
as
isabel
had
said
there
was
comfortable
room
for
not
more
than
half
of
them
in
a
few
minutes
people
were
crushed
who
never
ought
to
be
crushed
a
countess
for
whom
sofas
were
hardly
good
enough
was
seated
on
the
corner
of
a
table
till
some
younger
and
less
gorgeous
lady
could
be
made
to
give
way
and
the
marchioness
was
declaring
she
was
as
wet
through
as
though
she
had
been
dragged
in
a
river
boncassen
was
so
absolutely
quelled
as
to
have
retired
into
the
kitchen
attached
to
the
boncassen
with
all
his
country
pluck
and
pride
was
proving
to
a
knot
of
gentlemen
round
him
on
the
verandah
that
such
treachery
in
the
weather
was
a
thing
unknown
in
his
happier
country
miss
boncassen
had
to
do
her
best
to
console
the
splashed
ladies
oh
jones
is
it
not
a
pity
what
can
i
do
for
you
we
must
bear
it
my
dear
it
often
does
rain
but
why
on
this
special
day
should
it
come
down
out
of
buckets
i
never
was
so
wet
in
all
my
life
said
dolly
longstaff
poking
in
his
head
there
somebody
smoking
said
the
countess
angrily
there
was
a
crowd
of
men
smoking
out
on
the
verandah
i
never
knew
anything
so
nasty
the
countess
continued
leaving
it
in
doubt
whether
she
spoke
of
the
rain
or
the
smoke
or
the
party
generally
damp
gauzes
splashed
stockings
trampled
muslins
and
features
which
have
perhaps
known
something
of
rouge
and
certainly
encountered
something
of
rain
may
be
made
but
can
only
by
supreme
high
breeding
be
made
compatible
with
to
be
moist
muddy
rumpled
and
smeared
when
by
the
very
nature
of
your
position
it
is
your
duty
to
be
up
to
the
pellucidity
of
crystal
to
be
spotless
as
the
lily
to
be
crisp
as
the
and
as
clear
in
complexion
as
a
rose
is
it
not
o
gentle
readers
felt
to
be
a
disgrace
it
came
to
pass
therefore
that
many
were
now
very
cross
carriages
were
ordered
under
the
idea
that
some
improvement
might
be
made
at
the
inn
which
was
nearly
a
mile
distant
very
few
however
had
their
own
carriages
and
there
was
jockeying
for
the
vehicles
in
the
midst
of
all
this
silverbridge
remained
as
near
to
miss
boncassen
as
circumstances
would
admit
you
are
not
waiting
for
me
she
said
yes
i
am
we
might
as
well
go
up
to
town
together
leave
me
with
father
and
mother
like
the
captain
of
a
ship
i
must
be
the
last
to
leave
the
wreck
but
i
be
the
gallant
sailor
of
the
day
who
always
at
the
risk
of
his
life
sticks
to
the
skipper
to
the
last
moment
not
at
all
just
because
there
will
be
no
gallantry
but
come
and
see
us
and
find
out
whether
we
have
got
through
it
alive
chapter
xxxiii
the
langham
hotel
what
an
abominable
climate
boncassen
had
said
when
they
were
quite
alone
at
maidenhead
my
dear
you
did
think
you
were
to
bring
new
york
along
with
you
when
you
came
here
replied
her
husband
i
wish
i
was
going
back
that
a
foolish
thing
to
say
people
here
are
very
kind
and
you
are
seeing
a
great
deal
more
of
the
world
than
you
would
ever
see
at
home
i
am
having
a
very
good
time
what
do
you
say
bell
i
wish
i
could
have
kept
my
stockings
clean
but
what
about
the
young
men
young
men
are
pretty
much
the
same
everywhere
i
guess
they
never
have
their
wits
about
them
they
never
mean
what
they
say
because
they
do
understand
the
use
of
words
they
are
generally
half
impudent
and
half
timid
when
in
love
they
do
not
at
all
understand
what
has
befallen
them
what
they
want
they
try
to
compass
as
a
cow
does
when
it
stands
stretching
out
its
head
towards
a
stack
of
hay
which
it
can
not
reach
indeed
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
young
man
for
a
man
is
not
really
a
man
till
he
is
but
take
them
at
their
worst
they
are
a
deal
too
good
for
us
for
they
become
men
some
day
whereas
we
must
only
be
women
to
the
end
my
word
bella
exclaimed
the
mother
you
have
managed
to
be
tolerably
heavy
upon
god
creatures
taking
them
in
a
lump
said
the
father
boys
girls
and
cows
something
has
gone
wrong
with
you
besides
the
rain
nothing
on
earth
sir
except
the
boredom
some
young
man
has
been
talking
to
you
bella
one
or
two
mother
and
i
got
to
be
thinking
if
any
one
of
them
should
ask
me
to
marry
him
and
if
moved
by
some
evil
destiny
i
were
to
take
him
whether
i
should
murder
him
or
myself
or
run
away
with
one
of
the
others
could
you
bear
with
him
till
according
to
your
own
theory
he
would
grow
out
of
his
folly
said
the
father
being
a
woman
no
the
present
moment
is
always
everything
to
me
when
that
horrid
old
harridan
halloaed
out
that
somebody
was
smoking
i
thought
i
should
have
died
it
was
very
bad
just
then
awful
said
boncassen
shaking
her
head
i
did
seem
to
feel
it
much
said
the
father
one
does
look
to
have
everything
just
what
one
wants
always
if
i
did
i
should
go
nowhere
but
my
total
life
would
be
less
enjoyable
if
ever
you
do
get
married
bell
you
should
remember
that
i
mean
to
get
married
some
day
so
that
i
should
be
made
love
to
any
longer
i
hope
it
will
have
that
effect
said
the
father
mr
boncassen
ejaculated
the
mother
what
i
say
is
true
i
hope
it
will
have
that
effect
it
had
with
you
my
dear
i
do
know
that
people
did
think
of
me
as
much
as
of
anybody
else
even
though
i
was
married
then
my
dear
i
never
knew
it
miss
boncassen
though
she
had
behaved
serenely
and
with
good
temper
during
the
process
of
dolly
proposal
had
not
liked
it
she
had
a
very
high
opinion
of
herself
and
was
certainly
entitled
to
have
it
by
the
undisguised
admiration
of
all
that
came
near
her
she
was
not
more
indifferent
to
the
admiration
of
young
men
than
are
other
young
ladies
but
she
was
not
proud
of
the
admiration
of
dolly
longstaff
she
was
here
among
strangers
whose
ways
were
unknown
to
her
whose
rank
and
standing
in
the
world
were
vague
to
her
and
wonderful
in
their
dimness
she
knew
that
she
was
associating
with
men
very
different
from
those
at
home
where
young
men
were
supposed
to
be
under
the
necessity
of
earning
their
bread
at
new
york
she
would
dance
as
she
had
said
with
bank
clerks
she
was
not
prepared
to
admit
that
a
young
london
lord
was
better
than
a
new
york
bank
clerk
judging
the
men
on
their
own
individual
merits
she
might
find
the
bank
clerk
to
be
the
better
of
the
two
but
a
certain
sweetness
of
the
aroma
of
rank
was
beginning
to
permeate
her
republican
senses
the
softness
of
a
life
in
which
no
occupation
was
compulsory
had
its
charms
for
her
though
she
had
complained
of
the
insufficient
intelligence
of
young
men
she
was
alive
to
the
delight
of
having
nothings
said
to
her
pleasantly
all
this
had
affected
her
so
strongly
that
she
had
almost
felt
that
a
life
among
these
english
luxuries
would
be
a
pleasant
life
like
most
americans
who
do
not
as
yet
know
the
country
she
had
come
with
an
inward
feeling
that
as
an
american
and
a
republican
she
might
probably
be
despised
there
is
not
uncommonly
a
savageness
of
about
americans
which
arises
from
a
too
great
anxiety
to
be
admitted
to
fellowship
with
britons
she
had
felt
this
and
conscious
of
reputation
already
made
by
herself
in
the
social
life
of
new
york
she
had
half
trusted
that
she
would
be
well
received
in
london
and
had
half
convinced
herself
that
she
would
be
rejected
she
had
not
been
rejected
she
must
have
become
quite
aware
of
that
she
had
dropped
very
quickly
the
idea
that
she
would
be
scorned
ignorant
as
she
had
been
of
english
life
she
perceived
that
she
had
at
once
become
popular
and
this
had
been
so
in
spite
of
her
homeliness
and
her
father
awkwardness
by
herself
and
by
her
own
gifts
she
had
done
it
she
had
found
out
concerning
herself
that
she
had
that
which
would
commend
her
to
other
society
than
that
of
the
fifth
avenue
those
lords
of
whom
she
had
heard
were
as
plenty
with
her
as
blackberries
young
lord
silverbridge
of
whom
she
was
told
that
of
all
the
young
lords
of
the
day
he
stood
first
in
rank
and
wealth
was
peculiarly
her
friend
her
brain
was
firmer
than
that
of
most
girls
but
even
her
brain
was
a
little
turned
she
never
told
herself
that
it
would
be
well
for
her
to
become
the
wife
of
such
a
one
in
her
more
thoughtful
moments
she
told
herself
that
it
would
not
be
well
but
still
the
allurement
was
strong
upon
her
park
lane
was
sweeter
than
the
fifth
avenue
lord
silverbridge
was
nicer
than
the
bank
clerk
but
dolly
longstaff
was
not
she
would
certainly
prefer
the
bank
clerk
to
dolly
longstaff
and
yet
dolly
longstaff
was
the
one
among
her
english
admirers
who
had
come
forward
and
spoken
out
she
did
not
desire
that
any
one
should
come
forward
and
speak
out
but
it
was
an
annoyance
to
her
that
this
special
man
should
have
done
so
the
waiter
at
the
langham
understood
american
ways
perfectly
and
when
a
young
man
called
between
three
and
four
asking
for
boncassen
said
that
miss
boncassen
was
at
home
the
young
man
took
off
his
hat
brushed
up
his
hair
and
followed
the
waiter
up
to
the
the
door
was
opened
and
the
young
man
was
announced
mr
longstaff
miss
boncassen
was
rather
disgusted
she
had
had
enough
of
this
english
lover
why
should
he
have
come
after
what
had
occurred
yesterday
he
ought
to
have
felt
that
he
was
absolved
from
the
necessity
of
making
personal
inquiries
i
am
glad
to
see
that
you
got
home
safe
she
said
as
she
gave
him
her
hand
and
you
too
i
hope
well
so
so
with
my
clothes
a
good
deal
damaged
and
my
temper
rather
worse
i
am
so
sorry
it
should
not
rain
on
such
days
mother
has
gone
to
church
oh
indeed
i
like
going
to
church
myself
sometimes
do
you
now
i
know
what
would
make
me
like
to
go
to
church
and
father
is
at
the
athenæum
he
goes
there
to
do
a
little
light
reading
in
the
library
on
sunday
afternoon
i
shall
never
forget
yesterday
miss
boncassen
you
would
if
your
clothes
had
been
spoilt
as
mine
were
money
will
repair
that
well
yes
but
when
i
had
a
petticoat
flounced
particularly
to
order
i
do
like
to
see
it
there
are
emotions
of
the
heart
which
money
ca
touch
just
so
emotions
of
the
heart
that
the
very
phrase
she
was
determined
if
possible
to
prevent
a
repetition
of
the
scene
which
had
taken
place
up
at
de
bever
temple
all
my
emotions
are
about
my
dress
all
well
yes
all
i
guess
i
do
care
much
for
eating
and
drinking
in
saying
this
she
actually
contrived
to
produce
something
of
a
nasal
twang
eating
and
drinking
said
dolly
of
course
they
are
necessities
and
so
are
clothes
but
new
things
are
such
ducks
trowsers
may
be
said
dolly
then
she
took
a
prolonged
gaze
at
him
wondering
whether
he
was
or
was
not
such
a
fool
as
he
looked
how
funny
you
are
she
said
a
man
does
not
generally
feel
funny
after
going
through
what
i
suffered
yesterday
miss
boncassen
would
you
mind
ringing
the
bell
must
it
be
done
quite
at
once
quite
quite
she
said
i
can
do
it
myself
for
the
matter
of
that
and
she
rang
the
bell
somewhat
violently
dolly
sank
back
again
into
his
seat
remarking
in
his
usual
apathetic
way
that
he
had
intended
to
obey
her
behest
but
had
not
understood
that
she
was
in
so
great
a
hurry
i
am
always
in
a
hurry
she
said
i
like
things
to
be
done
sharp
and
she
hit
the
table
a
crack
please
bring
me
some
iced
water
this
of
course
was
addressed
to
the
waiter
and
a
glass
for
mr
longstaff
none
for
me
thank
you
perhaps
you
like
soda
and
brandy
oh
dear
no
nothing
of
the
kind
but
i
am
so
much
obliged
to
you
all
the
same
as
the
was
in
fact
standing
in
the
room
and
as
the
waiter
had
only
to
hand
the
glass
all
this
created
but
little
obstacle
still
it
had
its
effect
and
dolly
when
the
man
had
retired
felt
that
there
was
a
difficulty
in
proceeding
i
have
called
he
began
that
has
been
so
kind
of
you
but
mother
has
gone
to
church
i
am
very
glad
that
she
has
gone
to
church
because
i
wish
to
oh
laws
there
a
horse
has
tumbled
down
in
the
street
i
heard
it
he
has
got
up
again
said
dolly
looking
leisurely
out
of
the
window
but
as
i
was
saying
i
do
think
that
the
water
we
americans
drink
can
be
good
it
makes
the
women
become
ugly
so
young
you
will
never
become
ugly
she
got
up
and
curtsied
to
him
and
then
still
standing
made
him
a
speech
longstaff
it
would
be
absurd
of
me
to
pretend
not
to
understand
what
you
mean
but
i
wo
have
any
more
of
it
whether
you
are
making
fun
of
me
or
whether
you
are
in
earnest
it
is
just
the
same
making
fun
of
you
it
does
not
signify
i
do
care
which
it
is
but
i
wo
have
it
there
a
gentleman
should
be
allowed
to
express
his
feelings
and
to
explain
his
position
you
have
expressed
and
explained
more
than
enough
and
i
wo
have
any
more
if
you
will
sit
down
and
talk
about
something
else
or
else
go
away
there
shall
be
an
end
of
it
but
if
you
go
on
i
will
ring
the
bell
again
what
can
a
man
gain
by
going
on
when
a
girl
has
spoken
as
i
have
done
they
were
both
at
this
time
standing
up
and
he
was
now
as
angry
as
she
was
i
paid
you
the
greatest
compliment
a
man
can
pay
a
woman
he
began
very
well
if
i
remember
rightly
i
thanked
you
for
it
yesterday
if
you
wish
it
i
will
thank
you
again
but
it
is
a
compliment
which
becomes
very
much
the
reverse
if
it
be
repeated
too
often
you
are
sharp
enough
to
understand
that
i
have
done
everything
in
my
power
to
save
us
both
from
this
trouble
what
makes
you
so
fierce
miss
boncassen
what
makes
you
so
foolish
i
suppose
it
must
be
something
peculiar
to
american
ladies
just
that
something
peculiar
to
american
ladies
they
like
well
i
do
want
to
say
anything
more
that
can
be
called
fierce
at
this
moment
the
door
was
again
opened
and
lord
silverbridge
was
announced
halloa
dolly
are
you
here
it
seems
that
i
am
and
i
am
here
too
said
miss
boncassen
smiling
her
prettiest
none
the
worse
for
yesterday
troubles
i
hope
a
good
deal
the
worse
i
have
been
explaining
all
that
to
longstaff
who
has
been
quite
sympathetic
with
me
about
my
things
a
terrible
pity
that
shower
said
dolly
for
you
said
silverbridge
because
if
i
remember
right
miss
boncassen
was
walking
with
you
but
i
was
rather
glad
of
it
lord
silverbridge
i
regarded
it
as
a
direct
interposition
of
providence
because
you
would
not
dance
with
me
any
news
silverbridge
asked
dolly
nothing
particular
they
say
that
coalheaver
ca
run
for
the
leger
what
the
matter
asked
dolly
vigorously
broke
down
at
ascot
but
i
daresay
it
a
lie
sure
to
be
a
lie
said
dolly
what
do
you
think
of
madame
scholzdam
miss
boncassen
i
am
not
a
good
judge
never
heard
anything
equal
to
it
yet
in
this
world
said
dolly
i
wonder
whether
that
true
about
coalheaver
tifto
says
so
which
at
the
present
moment
asked
miss
boncassen
is
the
greater
favourite
with
the
public
madame
scholzdam
or
coalheaver
coalheaver
is
a
horse
miss
boncassen
oh
a
horse
perhaps
i
ought
to
say
a
colt
oh
a
colt
do
you
suppose
dolly
that
miss
boncassen
does
know
all
that
asked
silverbridge
he
supposes
that
my
american
ferocity
has
never
been
sufficiently
softened
for
the
reception
of
polite
erudition
you
two
have
been
quarrelling
i
fear
i
never
quarrel
with
a
woman
said
dolly
nor
with
a
man
in
my
presence
i
hope
said
miss
boncassen
somebody
does
seem
to
have
got
out
of
bed
at
the
wrong
side
said
silverbridge
i
did
said
miss
boncassen
i
got
out
of
bed
at
the
wrong
side
i
am
cross
i
ca
get
over
the
spoiling
of
my
flounces
i
think
you
had
better
both
go
away
and
leave
me
if
i
could
walk
about
the
room
for
half
an
hour
and
stamp
my
feet
i
should
get
better
silverbridge
thought
that
as
he
had
come
last
he
certainly
ought
to
be
left
last
miss
boncassen
felt
that
at
any
rate
longstaff
should
go
dolly
felt
that
his
manhood
required
him
to
remain
after
what
had
taken
place
he
was
not
going
to
leave
the
field
vacant
for
another
therefore
he
made
no
effort
to
move
that
seems
rather
hard
upon
me
said
silverbridge
you
told
me
to
come
i
told
you
to
come
and
ask
after
us
all
you
have
come
and
asked
after
us
and
have
been
informed
that
we
are
very
bad
what
more
can
i
say
you
accuse
me
of
getting
out
of
bed
the
wrong
side
and
i
own
that
i
did
i
meant
to
say
that
dolly
longstaff
had
done
so
and
i
say
it
was
silverbridge
said
dolly
we
are
very
agreeable
together
are
we
upon
my
word
i
think
you
better
both
go
silverbridge
immediately
got
up
from
his
chair
upon
which
dolly
also
moved
what
the
mischief
is
up
asked
silverbridge
when
they
were
under
the
porch
together
the
truth
is
you
never
can
tell
what
you
are
to
do
with
those
american
girls
i
suppose
you
have
been
making
up
to
her
nothing
in
earnest
she
seemed
to
me
to
like
admiration
so
i
told
her
i
admired
her
what
did
she
say
then
upon
my
word
you
seem
to
be
very
great
at
perhaps
you
had
better
go
back
and
ask
her
i
will
next
time
i
see
her
then
he
stepped
into
his
cab
and
in
a
loud
voice
ordered
the
man
to
drive
him
to
the
zoo
but
when
he
had
gone
a
little
way
up
portland
place
he
stopped
the
driver
and
desired
he
might
be
taken
back
again
to
the
hotel
as
he
left
the
vehicle
he
looked
round
for
dolly
but
dolly
had
certainly
gone
then
he
told
the
waiter
to
take
his
card
to
miss
boncassen
and
explain
that
he
had
something
to
say
which
he
had
forgotten
so
you
have
come
back
again
said
miss
boncassen
laughing
of
course
i
have
you
did
suppose
i
was
going
to
let
that
fellow
get
the
better
of
me
why
should
i
be
turned
out
because
he
had
made
an
ass
of
himself
who
said
he
made
an
ass
of
himself
but
he
had
had
he
no
by
no
means
said
she
after
a
little
pause
tell
me
what
he
had
been
saying
indeed
i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
kind
if
i
told
you
all
he
said
then
i
should
have
to
tell
the
next
man
all
that
you
may
say
would
that
be
fair
i
should
not
mind
said
silverbridge
i
dare
say
not
because
you
have
nothing
particular
to
say
but
the
principle
is
the
same
lawyers
and
doctors
and
parsons
talk
of
privileged
communications
why
should
not
a
young
lady
have
her
privileged
communications
but
i
have
something
particular
to
say
i
hope
not
why
should
you
hope
not
i
hate
having
things
said
particularly
nobody
likes
conversation
so
well
as
i
do
but
it
should
never
be
particular
i
was
going
to
tell
you
that
i
came
back
to
london
yesterday
in
the
same
carriage
with
old
lady
clanfiddle
and
that
she
swore
that
no
consideration
on
earth
would
ever
induce
her
to
go
to
maidenhead
again
that
is
particular
she
went
on
to
say
you
wo
tell
of
me
will
you
it
shall
all
be
privileged
she
went
on
to
say
that
americans
could
be
expected
to
understand
english
manners
perhaps
they
may
be
all
the
better
for
that
then
i
spoke
up
i
swore
i
was
awfully
in
love
with
you
you
did
i
did
that
you
were
out
and
away
the
finest
girl
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
of
course
you
understand
that
her
two
daughters
were
there
and
that
as
for
manners
unless
the
rain
could
be
attributed
to
american
manners
i
did
not
think
anything
had
gone
wrong
what
about
the
smoking
i
told
her
they
were
all
englishmen
and
that
if
she
had
been
giving
the
party
herself
they
would
have
smoked
just
as
much
you
must
understand
that
she
never
does
give
any
parties
how
could
you
be
so
there
was
ever
so
much
more
of
it
and
it
ended
in
her
telling
me
that
i
was
a
schoolboy
i
found
out
the
cause
of
it
all
a
great
spout
of
rain
had
come
upon
her
daughter
hat
and
that
had
produced
a
most
melancholy
catastrophe
i
would
have
given
her
mine
willingly
an
american
hat
to
be
worn
by
lady
violet
clanfiddle
it
came
from
paris
last
week
sir
but
must
have
been
contaminated
by
american
contact
now
lord
silverbridge
said
she
getting
up
if
i
had
a
stick
whip
you
it
was
such
fun
and
you
come
here
and
tell
it
all
to
me
of
course
i
do
it
was
a
deal
too
good
to
keep
it
to
myself
manners
as
he
said
this
he
almost
succeeded
in
looking
like
lady
clanfiddle
at
that
moment
boncassen
entered
the
room
and
was
immediately
appealed
to
by
his
daughter
father
you
must
turn
lord
silverbridge
out
of
the
room
dear
me
if
i
must
of
course
i
must
but
why
he
is
saying
everything
horrid
he
can
about
americans
after
this
they
settled
down
for
a
few
minutes
to
general
conversation
and
then
lord
silverbridge
again
took
his
leave
when
he
was
gone
isabel
boncassen
almost
regretted
that
the
something
particular
which
he
had
threatened
to
say
had
not
been
less
comic
in
its
nature
chapter
xxxiv
lord
popplecourt
when
the
reader
was
told
that
lord
popplecourt
had
found
lady
cantrip
very
agreeable
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
reader
was
disgusted
lord
popplecourt
would
certainly
not
have
given
a
second
thought
to
lady
cantrip
unless
he
had
been
specially
flattered
and
why
should
such
a
man
have
been
flattered
by
a
woman
who
was
in
all
respects
his
superior
the
reader
will
understand
it
had
been
settled
by
the
wisdom
of
the
elders
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
that
lord
popplecourt
should
marry
lady
mary
palliser
the
mutual
assent
which
leads
to
marriage
should
no
doubt
be
spontaneous
who
does
not
feel
that
young
love
should
speak
from
its
first
doubtful
unconscious
spark
a
spark
which
any
breath
of
air
may
quench
or
cherish
till
it
becomes
a
flame
which
nothing
can
satisfy
but
the
union
of
the
two
lovers
no
one
should
be
told
to
love
or
bidden
to
marry
this
man
or
that
woman
the
theory
of
this
is
plain
to
us
all
and
till
we
have
sons
or
daughters
whom
we
feel
imperatively
obliged
to
control
the
theory
is
unassailable
but
the
duty
is
so
imperative
the
duke
had
taught
himself
to
believe
that
as
his
wife
would
have
been
thrown
away
on
the
world
had
she
been
allowed
to
marry
burgo
fitzgerald
so
would
his
daughter
be
thrown
away
were
she
allowed
to
marry
tregear
therefore
the
theory
of
spontaneous
love
must
in
this
case
be
set
aside
therefore
the
spark
would
that
it
had
been
no
more
must
be
quenched
therefore
there
could
be
no
union
of
two
lovers
but
simply
a
prudent
and
perhaps
splendid
marriage
lord
popplecourt
was
a
man
in
possession
of
a
large
estate
which
was
unencumbered
his
rank
in
the
peerage
was
not
high
but
his
barony
was
of
an
old
date
and
if
things
went
well
with
him
something
higher
in
rank
might
be
open
to
him
he
had
good
looks
of
that
sort
which
recommend
themselves
to
pastors
and
masters
to
elders
and
betters
he
had
regular
features
he
looked
as
though
he
were
steady
he
was
not
impatient
nor
rollicking
silverbridge
was
also
but
his
good
looks
were
such
as
would
give
a
pang
to
the
hearts
of
anxious
mothers
of
daughters
tregear
was
the
handsomest
man
of
the
three
but
then
he
looked
as
though
he
had
no
betters
and
did
not
care
for
his
elders
lord
popplecourt
though
a
very
young
man
had
once
stammered
through
words
in
the
house
of
lords
and
had
been
known
to
dine
with
the
benevolent
funds
lord
silverbridge
had
declared
him
to
be
a
fool
no
one
thought
him
to
be
bright
but
in
the
eyes
of
the
duke
and
of
lady
cantrip
he
had
his
good
qualities
but
the
work
was
very
disagreeable
it
was
the
more
hard
upon
lady
cantrip
because
she
did
not
believe
in
it
if
it
could
be
done
it
would
be
expedient
but
she
felt
very
strongly
that
it
could
not
be
done
no
doubt
that
lady
glencora
had
been
turned
from
her
evil
destiny
but
lady
glencora
had
been
younger
than
her
daughter
was
now
and
possessed
of
less
character
nor
was
lady
cantrip
blind
to
the
difference
between
a
poor
man
with
a
bad
character
such
as
that
burgo
had
been
and
a
poor
man
with
a
good
character
such
as
was
tregear
nevertheless
she
undertook
to
aid
the
work
and
condescended
to
pretend
to
be
so
interested
in
the
portrait
of
some
common
ancestor
as
to
persuade
the
young
man
to
have
it
photographed
in
order
that
the
bringing
down
of
the
photograph
might
lead
to
something
he
took
the
photograph
and
lady
cantrip
said
very
much
to
him
about
his
grandmother
who
was
the
old
lady
in
question
she
could
she
said
just
remember
the
features
of
the
dear
old
woman
she
was
not
habitually
a
hypocrite
and
she
hated
herself
for
what
she
was
doing
and
yet
her
object
was
simply
good
to
bring
together
two
young
people
who
might
advantageously
marry
each
other
the
mere
talking
about
the
old
woman
would
be
of
no
service
she
longed
to
bring
out
the
offer
plainly
and
say
there
is
lady
mary
palliser
do
you
think
she
make
a
good
wife
for
you
but
she
could
not
as
yet
bring
herself
to
be
so
indelicately
plain
you
have
seen
the
duke
since
she
asked
he
spoke
to
me
only
yesterday
in
the
house
i
like
the
duke
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
say
so
it
would
be
for
your
advantage
that
he
should
like
you
that
is
if
you
mean
to
take
a
part
in
politics
i
suppose
i
shall
said
popplecourt
there
is
much
else
to
do
you
do
go
to
races
he
shook
his
head
i
am
glad
of
that
said
lady
cantrip
nothing
is
so
bad
as
the
turf
i
fear
lord
silverbridge
is
devoting
himself
to
the
turf
i
do
think
it
can
be
good
for
any
man
to
have
much
to
do
with
major
tifto
i
suppose
silverbridge
knows
what
he
about
here
was
an
opportunity
which
might
have
been
used
it
would
have
been
so
easy
for
her
to
glide
from
the
imperfections
of
the
brother
to
the
perfections
of
the
sister
but
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
do
it
quite
at
once
she
approached
the
matter
however
as
nearly
as
she
could
without
making
her
grand
proposition
she
shook
her
head
sadly
in
reference
to
silverbridge
and
then
spoke
of
the
duke
his
father
is
so
anxious
about
him
i
dare
say
i
do
know
any
man
who
is
more
painfully
anxious
about
his
children
he
feels
the
responsibility
so
much
since
his
wife
death
there
is
lady
mary
she
all
right
i
should
say
all
right
oh
yes
but
when
a
girl
is
possessed
of
so
many
things
rank
beauty
intelligence
large
fortune
will
lady
mary
have
much
a
large
portion
of
her
mother
money
i
should
say
when
all
these
things
are
joined
together
a
father
of
course
feels
most
anxious
as
to
their
disposal
i
suppose
she
is
clever
very
clever
said
lady
cantrip
i
think
a
girl
may
be
too
clever
you
know
said
lord
popplecourt
perhaps
she
may
but
i
know
more
who
are
too
foolish
i
am
so
much
obliged
to
you
for
the
photograph
do
mention
it
i
really
did
mean
that
you
should
send
a
man
down
on
that
occasion
the
two
young
people
did
not
see
each
other
lady
mary
did
not
come
down
and
lady
cantrip
lacked
the
courage
to
send
for
her
as
it
was
might
it
not
be
possible
that
the
young
man
should
be
induced
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
the
young
lady
without
any
further
explanation
but
between
young
people
can
not
well
take
place
unless
they
be
brought
together
there
was
a
difficulty
in
bringing
them
together
at
richmond
the
duke
had
indeed
spoken
of
meeting
lord
popplecourt
at
dinner
there
but
this
was
to
have
followed
the
proposition
which
lady
cantrip
should
make
to
him
she
could
not
yet
make
the
proposition
and
therefore
she
hardly
knew
how
to
arrange
the
dinner
she
was
obliged
at
last
to
let
the
lover
go
away
without
arranging
anything
when
the
duke
should
have
settled
his
autumn
plans
then
an
attempt
must
be
made
to
induce
lord
popplecourt
to
travel
in
the
same
direction
that
evening
lady
cantrip
said
a
few
words
to
mary
respecting
the
proposed
suitor
there
is
nothing
i
have
such
a
horror
of
as
gambling
she
said
it
is
dreadful
i
am
very
glad
to
think
that
nidderdale
does
not
do
anything
of
that
sort
it
was
perhaps
on
the
cards
that
nidderdale
should
do
things
of
which
she
knew
nothing
i
hope
silverbridge
does
not
bet
i
do
think
he
does
there
lord
popplecourt
quite
a
young
man
with
everything
at
his
own
disposal
and
a
very
large
estate
think
of
the
evil
he
might
do
if
he
were
given
that
way
does
he
gamble
not
at
all
it
must
be
such
a
comfort
to
his
mother
he
looks
to
me
as
though
he
never
would
do
anything
said
lady
mary
then
the
subject
was
dropped
it
was
a
week
after
this
towards
the
end
of
july
that
the
duke
wrote
a
line
to
lady
cantrip
apologising
for
what
he
had
done
but
explaining
that
he
had
asked
lord
popplecourt
to
dine
at
the
horns
on
a
certain
sunday
he
had
he
said
been
assured
by
lord
cantrip
that
such
an
arrangement
would
be
quite
convenient
it
was
clear
from
his
letter
that
he
was
much
in
earnest
of
course
there
was
no
reason
why
the
dinner
should
not
be
eaten
only
the
speciality
of
the
invitation
to
lord
popplecourt
must
not
be
so
glaring
that
he
himself
should
be
struck
by
the
strangeness
of
it
there
must
be
a
little
party
made
up
lord
nidderdale
and
his
wife
were
therefore
bidden
to
come
down
and
silverbridge
who
at
first
consented
rather
unwillingly
and
lady
mabel
grex
as
to
whom
the
duke
made
a
special
request
that
she
might
be
asked
this
last
invitation
was
sent
express
from
lady
mary
and
included
miss
cass
so
the
party
was
made
up
the
careful
reader
will
perceive
that
there
were
to
be
ten
of
them
is
it
odd
papa
wanting
to
have
lady
mabel
mary
said
to
lady
cantrip
does
he
not
know
her
my
dear
he
hardly
ever
spoke
to
her
i
tell
you
what
i
expect
silverbridge
is
going
to
marry
her
why
should
he
i
do
know
why
he
should
she
is
very
beautiful
and
very
clever
but
if
so
papa
must
know
all
about
it
it
does
seem
so
odd
that
papa
of
all
people
should
turn
or
even
that
he
should
think
of
it
so
much
is
thrown
upon
him
now
said
lady
cantrip
poor
papa
then
she
remembered
herself
and
spoke
with
a
little
start
of
course
i
am
not
thinking
of
myself
arranging
a
marriage
is
very
different
from
preventing
any
one
from
marrying
whatever
he
may
think
to
be
his
duty
he
will
be
sure
to
do
it
said
the
elder
lady
very
solemnly
lady
mabel
was
surprised
by
the
invitation
but
she
was
not
slow
to
accept
it
papa
will
be
here
and
will
be
so
glad
to
meet
you
lady
mary
had
said
why
should
the
duke
of
omnium
wish
to
meet
her
silverbridge
will
be
here
too
mary
had
gone
on
to
say
it
is
just
a
family
party
papa
you
know
is
not
going
anywhere
nor
am
i
by
all
this
lady
mabel
thoughts
were
much
stirred
and
her
bosom
somewhat
moved
and
silverbridge
also
was
moved
by
it
of
course
he
could
not
but
remember
that
he
had
pledged
himself
to
his
father
to
ask
lady
mabel
to
be
his
wife
he
had
faltered
since
she
had
been
he
thought
unkind
to
him
or
at
any
rate
indifferent
he
had
surely
said
enough
to
her
to
make
her
know
what
he
meant
and
yet
she
had
taken
no
trouble
to
meet
him
half
way
and
then
isabel
boncassen
had
intervened
now
he
was
asked
to
dinner
in
a
most
unusual
manner
of
all
the
guests
invited
lord
popplecourt
was
perhaps
the
least
disturbed
he
was
quite
alive
to
the
honour
of
being
noticed
by
the
duke
of
omnium
and
alive
also
to
the
flattering
courtesy
shown
to
him
by
lady
cantrip
but
justice
would
not
be
done
him
unless
it
were
acknowledged
that
he
had
as
yet
flattered
himself
with
no
hopes
in
regard
to
lady
mary
palliser
he
when
he
prepared
himself
for
his
journey
down
to
richmond
thought
much
more
of
the
duke
than
of
the
duke
daughter
oh
yes
i
can
drive
you
down
if
you
like
that
kind
of
thing
silverbridge
said
to
him
on
the
saturday
evening
and
bring
me
back
if
you
will
come
when
i
am
coming
i
hate
waiting
for
a
fellow
suppose
we
leave
at
ten
i
wo
fix
any
time
but
if
we
ca
make
it
suit
there
be
the
governor
carriage
will
the
duke
go
down
in
his
carriage
i
suppose
so
it
quicker
and
less
trouble
than
the
railway
then
lord
popplecourt
reflected
that
he
would
certainly
come
back
with
the
duke
if
he
could
so
manage
it
and
there
floated
before
his
eyes
visions
of
all
of
which
might
owe
their
origin
to
this
proposed
drive
up
from
richmond
at
six
on
the
sunday
evening
silverbridge
called
for
lord
popplecourt
upon
my
word
said
he
i
did
ever
expect
to
see
you
in
my
cab
why
not
me
especially
because
you
not
one
of
our
lot
you
sooner
have
tifto
i
dare
say
no
i
would
tifto
is
not
at
all
a
pleasant
companion
though
he
understands
horses
you
going
in
for
heavy
politics
i
suppose
not
particularly
heavy
if
not
why
on
earth
does
my
governor
take
you
up
you
wo
mind
my
smoking
i
dare
say
after
this
there
was
no
conversation
between
them
chapter
xxxv
do
you
think
it
was
pretty
to
see
the
duke
reception
of
lady
mabel
i
knew
your
mother
many
years
ago
he
said
when
i
was
young
myself
her
mother
and
my
mother
were
first
cousins
and
dear
friends
he
held
her
hand
as
he
spoke
and
looked
at
her
as
though
he
meant
to
love
her
lady
mabel
saw
that
it
was
so
could
it
be
possible
that
the
duke
had
heard
anything
that
he
should
wish
to
receive
her
she
had
told
herself
and
had
told
miss
cassewary
that
though
she
had
spared
silverbridge
yet
she
knew
that
she
would
make
him
a
good
wife
if
the
duke
thought
so
also
then
surely
she
need
not
doubt
i
knew
we
were
cousins
she
said
and
have
been
so
proud
of
the
connection
lord
silverbridge
does
come
and
see
us
sometimes
soon
after
that
silverbridge
and
popplecourt
came
in
if
the
story
of
the
old
woman
in
the
portrait
may
be
taken
as
evidence
of
a
family
connexion
between
lady
cantrip
and
lord
popplecourt
everybody
there
was
more
or
less
connected
with
everybody
else
nidderdale
had
been
a
first
cousin
of
lady
glencora
and
he
had
married
a
daughter
of
lady
cantrip
they
were
manifestly
a
family
party
thanks
to
the
old
woman
in
the
picture
it
is
a
point
of
conscience
among
the
perhaps
not
ten
thousand
but
say
one
thousand
of
bluest
blood
that
everybody
should
know
who
everybody
is
our
duke
though
he
had
not
given
his
mind
much
to
the
pursuit
had
nevertheless
learned
his
lesson
it
is
a
knowledge
which
the
possession
of
the
blue
blood
itself
produces
there
are
countries
with
bluer
blood
than
our
own
in
which
to
be
without
such
knowledge
is
a
crime
when
the
old
lady
in
the
portrait
had
been
discussed
popplecourt
was
close
to
lady
mary
they
two
had
no
idea
why
such
vicinity
had
been
planned
the
duke
knew
of
course
and
lady
cantrip
lady
cantrip
had
whispered
to
her
daughter
that
such
a
marriage
would
be
suitable
and
the
daughter
had
hinted
it
to
her
husband
lord
cantrip
of
course
was
not
in
the
dark
lady
mabel
had
expressed
a
hint
on
the
matter
to
miss
cass
who
had
not
repudiated
it
even
silverbridge
had
suggested
to
himself
that
something
of
the
kind
might
be
in
the
wind
thinking
that
if
so
none
of
them
knew
much
about
his
sister
mary
but
popplecourt
himself
was
divinely
innocent
his
ideas
of
marriage
had
as
yet
gone
no
farther
than
a
conviction
that
girls
generally
were
things
which
would
be
pressed
on
him
and
against
which
he
must
arm
himself
with
some
shield
marriage
would
have
to
come
no
doubt
but
not
the
less
was
it
his
duty
to
live
as
though
it
were
a
pit
towards
which
he
would
be
tempted
by
female
allurements
but
that
a
net
should
be
spread
over
him
here
he
was
much
too
to
imagine
very
hot
he
said
to
lady
mary
we
found
it
warm
in
church
i
dare
say
i
came
down
here
with
your
brother
in
his
hansom
cab
what
a
very
odd
thing
to
have
a
hansom
cab
i
should
like
one
should
you
indeed
particularly
if
i
could
drive
it
myself
silverbridge
does
at
night
when
he
thinks
people
wo
see
him
drive
the
cab
in
the
streets
what
does
he
do
with
his
man
puts
him
inside
he
was
out
once
without
the
man
and
took
up
a
fare
an
old
woman
he
said
and
when
she
was
going
to
pay
him
he
touched
his
hat
and
said
he
never
took
money
from
ladies
do
you
believe
that
oh
yes
i
call
that
good
fun
because
it
did
no
harm
he
had
his
lark
the
lady
was
taken
where
she
wanted
to
go
and
she
saved
her
money
suppose
he
had
upset
her
said
lord
popplecourt
looking
as
an
old
philosopher
might
have
looked
when
he
had
found
some
clenching
answer
to
another
philosopher
argument
the
real
cabman
might
have
upset
her
worse
said
lady
mary
do
you
feel
it
odd
that
we
should
meet
here
said
lord
silverbridge
to
his
neighbour
lady
mabel
anything
unexpected
is
odd
said
lady
mabel
it
seemed
to
her
to
be
very
odd
unless
certain
people
had
made
up
their
minds
as
to
the
expediency
of
a
certain
event
that
is
what
you
call
logic
is
it
anything
unexpected
is
odd
lord
silverbridge
i
wo
be
laughed
at
you
have
been
at
oxford
and
ought
to
know
what
logic
is
that
at
any
rate
is
he
replied
turning
very
red
in
the
face
you
do
think
i
meant
it
oh
lord
silverbridge
say
that
you
do
think
i
meant
it
you
can
not
think
i
would
willingly
wound
you
indeed
indeed
i
was
not
thinking
it
had
in
truth
been
an
accident
she
could
not
speak
aloud
because
they
were
closely
surrounded
by
others
but
she
looked
up
in
his
face
to
see
whether
he
were
angry
with
her
say
that
you
do
not
think
i
meant
it
i
do
not
think
you
meant
it
i
would
not
say
a
word
to
hurt
you
oh
for
more
than
i
can
tell
you
it
is
all
bosh
of
course
he
said
laughing
but
i
do
not
like
to
hear
the
old
place
named
i
have
always
made
a
fool
of
myself
some
men
do
it
and
do
care
about
it
but
i
do
it
and
yet
it
makes
me
miserable
if
that
be
so
you
will
soon
give
over
making
what
you
call
a
fool
of
yourself
for
myself
i
like
the
idea
of
wild
oats
i
look
upon
them
like
measles
only
you
should
have
a
doctor
ready
when
the
disease
shows
itself
what
sort
of
a
doctor
ought
i
to
have
ah
you
must
find
out
that
yourself
that
sort
of
feeling
which
makes
you
feel
miserable
that
is
a
doctor
itself
or
a
wife
or
a
wife
if
you
can
find
a
good
one
there
are
wives
you
know
who
aggravate
the
disease
if
i
had
a
fast
husband
i
should
make
him
faster
by
being
fast
myself
there
is
nothing
i
envy
so
much
as
the
power
of
doing
things
women
can
do
that
too
but
they
go
to
the
dogs
we
are
dreadfully
restricted
if
you
like
champagne
you
can
have
a
bucketful
i
am
obliged
to
pretend
that
i
only
want
a
very
little
you
can
bet
thousands
i
must
confine
myself
to
gloves
you
can
flirt
with
any
woman
you
please
i
must
wait
till
somebody
comes
and
put
up
with
it
if
nobody
does
come
plenty
come
no
doubt
but
i
want
to
pick
and
choose
a
man
turns
the
girls
over
one
after
another
as
one
does
the
papers
when
one
is
fitting
up
a
room
or
rolls
them
out
as
one
rolls
out
the
carpets
a
very
careful
young
man
like
lord
popplecourt
might
reject
a
young
woman
because
her
hair
did
suit
the
colour
of
his
furniture
i
do
think
that
i
shall
choose
my
wife
as
i
would
papers
and
carpets
the
duke
who
sat
between
lady
cantrip
and
her
daughter
did
his
best
to
make
himself
agreeable
the
conversation
had
been
political
to
the
usual
feminine
extent
and
had
consisted
chiefly
of
sarcasms
from
lady
cantrip
against
sir
timothy
beeswax
that
england
should
put
up
with
such
a
man
lady
cantrip
had
said
is
to
me
shocking
there
used
to
be
a
feeling
in
favour
of
gentlemen
to
this
the
duke
had
responded
by
asserting
that
sir
timothy
had
displayed
great
aptitude
for
parliamentary
life
and
knew
the
house
of
commons
better
than
most
men
he
said
nothing
against
his
foe
and
very
much
in
his
foe
praise
but
lady
cantrip
perceived
that
she
had
succeeded
in
pleasing
him
when
the
ladies
were
gone
the
politics
became
more
serious
that
unfortunate
quarrel
is
to
go
on
the
same
as
ever
i
suppose
said
the
duke
addressing
himself
to
the
two
young
men
who
had
seats
in
the
house
of
commons
they
were
both
on
the
conservative
side
in
politics
the
three
peers
present
were
all
liberals
till
next
session
i
think
sir
said
silverbridge
sir
timothy
though
he
did
lose
his
temper
has
managed
it
well
said
lord
cantrip
phineas
finn
lost
his
temper
worse
than
sir
timothy
said
lord
nidderdale
but
yet
i
think
he
had
the
feeling
of
the
house
with
him
said
the
duke
i
happened
to
be
present
in
the
gallery
at
the
time
yes
said
nidderdale
because
he
up
the
fact
is
if
you
up
in
a
genial
sort
of
way
the
house
will
forgive
anything
if
i
were
to
murder
my
grandmother
and
when
questioned
about
it
were
to
acknowledge
that
i
had
done
it
then
lord
nidderdale
stood
up
and
made
his
speech
as
he
might
have
made
it
in
the
house
of
commons
regret
to
say
sir
that
the
old
woman
did
get
in
my
way
when
i
was
in
a
passion
unfortunately
i
had
a
heavy
stick
in
my
hand
and
i
did
strike
her
over
the
head
nobody
can
regret
it
so
much
as
i
do
nobody
can
feel
so
acutely
the
position
in
which
i
am
placed
i
have
sat
in
this
house
for
many
years
and
many
gentlemen
know
me
well
i
think
sir
that
they
will
acknowledge
that
i
am
a
man
not
deficient
in
filial
piety
or
general
humanity
sir
i
am
sorry
for
what
i
did
in
a
moment
of
heat
i
have
now
spoken
the
truth
and
i
shall
leave
myself
in
the
hands
of
the
house
my
belief
is
i
should
get
such
a
round
of
applause
as
i
certainly
shall
never
achieve
in
any
other
way
it
is
not
only
that
a
popular
man
may
do
it
like
phineas
finn
but
the
most
unpopular
man
in
the
house
may
make
himself
liked
by
owning
freely
that
he
has
done
something
that
he
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
nidderdale
unwonted
eloquence
was
received
in
good
part
by
the
assembled
legislators
taking
it
altogether
said
the
duke
i
know
of
no
assembly
in
any
country
in
which
prevails
so
generally
in
which
the
members
behave
to
each
other
so
well
in
which
rules
are
so
universally
followed
or
in
which
the
president
is
so
thoroughly
sustained
by
the
feeling
of
the
members
i
hear
men
say
that
it
is
quite
what
it
used
to
be
said
silverbridge
nothing
will
ever
be
quite
what
it
used
to
be
changes
for
the
worse
i
mean
men
are
doing
all
kinds
of
things
just
because
the
rules
of
the
house
allow
them
if
they
be
within
rule
said
the
duke
i
do
know
who
is
to
blame
them
in
my
time
if
any
man
stretched
a
rule
too
far
the
house
would
not
put
up
with
it
that
just
it
said
nidderdale
the
house
puts
up
with
anything
now
there
is
a
great
deal
of
good
feeling
no
doubt
but
there
no
earnestness
about
anything
i
think
you
are
more
earnest
than
we
but
then
you
are
such
horrid
bores
and
each
earnest
man
is
in
earnest
about
something
that
nobody
else
cares
for
when
they
were
again
in
the
lord
popplecourt
was
seated
next
to
lady
mary
where
are
you
going
this
autumn
he
asked
i
do
know
in
the
least
papa
said
something
about
going
abroad
you
wo
be
at
custins
custins
was
lord
cantrip
country
seat
in
dorsetshire
i
know
nothing
about
myself
as
yet
but
i
do
think
i
shall
go
anywhere
unless
papa
goes
too
lady
cantrip
has
asked
me
to
be
at
custins
in
the
middle
of
october
they
say
it
is
about
the
best
in
england
do
you
shoot
much
a
great
deal
i
shall
be
in
scotland
on
the
twelfth
i
and
reginald
dobbes
have
a
place
together
i
shall
get
to
my
own
partridges
on
the
of
september
i
always
manage
that
popplecourt
is
in
suffolk
and
i
do
think
any
man
in
england
can
beat
me
for
partridges
what
do
you
do
with
all
you
slay
leadenhall
market
i
make
it
pay
or
very
nearly
then
i
shall
run
back
to
scotland
for
the
end
of
the
stalking
and
i
can
easily
manage
to
be
at
custins
by
the
middle
of
october
i
never
touch
my
own
pheasants
till
november
why
are
you
so
abstemious
the
birds
are
heavier
and
it
answers
better
but
if
i
thought
you
would
be
at
custins
it
would
be
much
nicer
lady
mary
again
told
him
that
as
yet
she
knew
nothing
of
her
father
autumn
movements
but
at
the
same
time
the
duke
was
arranging
his
autumn
movements
or
at
any
rate
those
of
his
daughter
lady
cantrip
had
told
him
that
the
desirable
had
promised
to
go
to
custins
and
suggested
that
he
and
mary
should
also
be
there
in
his
daughter
name
he
promised
but
he
would
not
bind
himself
would
it
not
be
better
that
he
should
be
absent
now
that
the
doing
of
this
thing
was
brought
nearer
to
him
so
that
he
could
see
and
feel
its
details
he
was
disgusted
by
it
and
yet
it
had
answered
so
well
with
his
wife
is
lord
popplecourt
intimate
here
lady
mabel
asked
her
friend
lord
silverbridge
i
do
know
i
am
not
lady
cantrip
seems
to
think
a
great
deal
about
him
i
dare
say
i
do
your
father
seems
to
like
him
that
possible
too
they
going
back
to
london
together
in
the
governor
carriage
my
father
will
talk
high
politics
all
the
way
and
popplecourt
will
agree
with
everything
he
is
intended
to
to
you
know
what
i
mean
i
ca
say
that
i
do
to
cut
out
poor
frank
it
quite
possible
poor
frank
you
had
a
great
deal
better
say
poor
popplecourt
or
poor
governor
or
poor
lady
cantrip
but
a
hundred
countesses
ca
make
your
sister
marry
a
man
she
does
like
just
that
they
do
go
the
right
way
about
it
what
would
you
do
leave
her
alone
let
her
find
out
gradually
that
what
she
wants
ca
be
done
and
so
linger
on
for
years
said
lady
mabel
reproachfully
i
say
nothing
about
that
the
man
is
my
friend
and
you
ought
to
be
proud
of
him
i
never
knew
anybody
yet
that
was
proud
of
his
friends
i
like
him
well
enough
but
i
can
quite
understand
that
the
governor
should
object
yes
we
all
know
that
said
she
sadly
what
would
your
father
say
if
you
wanted
to
marry
someone
who
a
shilling
i
should
object
myself
without
waiting
for
my
father
but
then
neither
have
i
a
shilling
if
i
had
money
do
you
think
i
would
like
to
give
it
to
the
man
i
loved
but
this
is
a
case
of
giving
somebody
else
money
they
wo
make
her
give
it
up
by
bringing
such
a
young
ass
as
that
down
here
if
my
father
has
persistency
enough
to
let
her
cry
her
eyes
out
succeed
and
break
her
heart
could
you
do
that
certainly
not
but
then
i
soft
i
ca
refuse
ca
you
not
if
the
person
who
asks
me
is
in
my
good
books
you
try
me
what
shall
i
ask
for
anything
give
me
that
ring
off
your
finger
she
said
he
at
once
took
it
off
his
hand
of
course
you
know
i
am
in
joke
you
do
imagine
that
i
would
take
it
from
you
he
still
held
it
towards
her
lord
silverbridge
i
expect
that
with
you
i
may
say
a
foolish
word
without
being
brought
to
sorrow
by
it
i
know
that
that
ring
belonged
to
your
and
to
fifty
pallisers
before
what
would
it
matter
and
it
would
be
wholly
useless
to
me
as
i
could
not
wear
it
of
course
it
would
be
too
big
said
he
replacing
the
ring
on
his
own
finger
but
when
i
talk
of
any
one
being
in
my
good
books
i
do
mean
a
thing
like
that
do
you
know
there
is
nobody
on
earth
i
there
he
paused
and
blushed
and
she
sat
motionless
looking
at
him
expecting
with
her
colour
too
somewhat
raised
whom
i
like
so
well
as
i
do
you
it
was
a
lame
conclusion
she
felt
it
to
be
lame
but
as
regarded
him
the
lameness
at
the
moment
had
come
from
a
timidity
which
forbade
him
to
say
the
word
love
even
though
he
had
meant
to
say
it
she
recovered
herself
instantly
i
do
believe
it
she
said
i
do
think
that
we
are
real
friends
would
you
not
take
a
ring
from
a
real
friend
not
that
ring
nor
a
ring
at
all
after
i
had
asked
for
it
in
joke
you
understand
it
all
but
to
go
back
to
what
we
were
talking
about
if
you
can
do
anything
for
frank
pray
do
you
know
it
will
break
her
heart
a
man
of
course
bears
it
better
but
he
does
not
perhaps
suffer
the
less
it
is
all
his
life
to
him
he
can
do
nothing
while
this
is
going
on
are
you
not
true
enough
to
your
friendship
to
exert
yourself
for
him
silverbridge
put
his
hand
up
and
rubbed
his
head
as
though
he
were
vexed
your
aid
would
turn
everything
in
his
favour
you
do
not
know
my
father
is
he
so
inexorable
it
is
not
that
mabel
but
he
is
so
unhappy
i
can
not
add
to
his
unhappiness
by
taking
part
against
him
in
another
part
of
the
room
lady
cantrip
was
busy
with
lord
popplecourt
she
had
talked
about
pheasants
and
had
talked
about
grouse
had
talked
about
moving
the
address
in
the
house
of
lords
in
some
coming
session
and
the
great
value
of
political
alliances
early
in
life
till
the
young
peer
began
to
think
that
lady
cantrip
was
the
nicest
of
women
then
after
a
short
pause
she
changed
the
subject
do
you
think
lady
mary
very
beautiful
uncommon
said
his
lordship
and
her
manners
so
perfect
she
has
all
her
mother
ease
without
any
of
that
you
know
what
i
mean
quite
so
said
his
lordship
and
then
she
has
got
so
much
in
her
has
she
though
i
do
know
any
girl
of
her
age
so
thoroughly
well
educated
the
duke
seems
to
take
to
you
well
yes
the
duke
is
very
kind
do
you
think
eh
you
have
heard
of
her
mother
fortune
tremendous
she
will
have
i
take
it
quite
a
third
of
it
whatever
i
say
sure
you
will
take
in
confidence
but
she
is
a
dear
dear
girl
and
i
am
anxious
for
her
happiness
almost
as
though
she
belonged
to
me
lord
popplecourt
went
back
to
town
in
the
duke
carriage
but
was
unable
to
say
a
word
about
politics
his
mind
was
altogether
filled
with
the
wonderful
words
that
had
been
spoken
to
him
could
it
be
that
lady
mary
had
fallen
violently
in
love
with
him
he
would
not
at
once
give
himself
up
to
the
pleasing
idea
having
so
thoroughly
grounded
himself
in
the
belief
that
female
nets
were
to
be
avoided
but
when
he
got
home
he
did
think
favourably
of
it
the
daughter
of
a
duke
and
such
a
duke
so
lovely
a
girl
and
with
such
gifts
and
then
a
fortune
which
would
make
a
material
addition
to
his
own
large
property
chapter
xxxvi
lodge
we
all
know
that
very
clever
distich
concerning
the
great
fleas
and
the
little
fleas
which
tells
us
that
no
animal
is
too
humble
to
have
its
parasite
even
major
tifto
had
his
inferior
friend
this
was
a
certain
captain
green
for
the
friend
also
affected
military
honours
he
was
a
man
somewhat
older
than
tifto
of
whose
antecedents
no
one
was
supposed
to
know
anything
it
was
presumed
of
him
that
he
lived
by
betting
and
it
was
boasted
by
those
who
wished
to
defend
his
character
that
when
he
lost
he
paid
his
money
like
a
gentleman
tifto
during
the
last
year
or
two
had
been
anxious
to
support
captain
green
and
had
always
made
use
of
this
argument
where
the
d
he
gets
his
money
i
do
know
but
when
he
loses
there
it
is
major
tifto
had
a
little
box
of
his
own
in
the
neighbourhood
of
egham
at
which
he
had
a
set
of
stables
a
little
bigger
than
his
house
and
a
set
of
kennels
a
little
bigger
than
his
stables
it
was
here
he
kept
his
horses
and
hounds
and
himself
too
when
business
connected
with
his
sporting
life
did
not
take
him
to
town
it
was
now
the
middle
of
august
and
he
had
come
to
lodge
there
to
look
after
his
establishments
to
make
arrangements
for
and
to
prepare
for
the
autumn
racing
campaign
on
this
occasion
captain
green
was
enjoying
his
hospitality
and
assisting
him
by
sage
counsels
behind
the
little
box
was
a
little
garden
a
garden
that
was
very
little
but
still
thus
close
to
the
parlour
window
there
was
room
for
a
small
table
to
be
put
on
the
and
for
a
couple
of
armchairs
here
the
major
and
the
captain
were
seated
about
eight
one
evening
with
convivial
good
things
within
their
reach
the
good
things
were
and
pipes
the
two
gentlemen
had
not
dressed
strictly
for
dinner
they
had
spent
a
great
part
of
the
day
handling
the
hounds
and
the
horses
dressing
wounds
curing
sores
and
ministering
to
canine
ailments
and
had
been
detained
over
their
work
too
long
to
think
of
their
toilet
as
it
was
they
had
an
eye
to
business
the
stables
at
one
corner
and
the
kennels
at
the
other
were
close
to
the
little
garden
and
the
doings
of
a
man
and
a
boy
who
were
still
at
work
among
the
animals
could
be
directed
from
the
armchairs
on
which
the
two
sportsmen
were
sitting
it
must
be
explained
that
ever
since
the
silverbridge
election
there
had
been
a
growing
feeling
in
tifto
mind
that
he
had
been
by
his
partner
the
feeling
was
strengthened
by
the
admirable
condition
of
prime
minister
surely
more
consideration
had
been
due
to
a
man
who
had
produced
such
a
state
of
things
i
would
quarrel
with
him
but
i
make
him
pay
his
way
said
the
prudent
captain
as
for
that
of
course
he
does
pay
his
share
who
does
all
the
work
that
true
the
fact
is
tifto
you
do
make
enough
out
of
it
when
a
small
man
like
you
has
to
deal
with
a
big
man
like
that
he
may
take
it
out
of
him
in
one
of
two
ways
but
he
must
be
deuced
clever
if
he
can
get
it
both
ways
what
are
you
driving
at
asked
tifto
who
did
not
like
being
called
a
small
man
feeling
himself
to
be
every
inch
a
master
of
foxhounds
why
this
look
at
that
d
fellow
fretting
that
with
a
switch
if
you
ca
strap
a
without
a
stick
in
your
hand
do
you
strap
him
at
all
you
then
there
came
a
volley
of
abuse
out
of
the
captain
mouth
in
the
middle
of
which
the
man
threw
down
the
rubber
he
was
using
and
walked
away
you
come
back
halloed
tifto
jumping
up
from
his
seat
with
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
then
there
was
a
general
quarrel
between
the
man
and
his
two
masters
in
which
the
man
at
last
was
victorious
and
the
horse
was
taken
into
the
stable
in
an
unfinished
condition
all
very
well
to
say
rid
of
him
but
where
am
i
to
get
anybody
better
it
has
come
to
such
a
pass
that
now
if
you
speak
to
a
fellow
he
walks
out
of
the
yard
they
then
returned
to
the
state
of
affairs
as
it
was
between
tifto
and
lord
silverbridge
what
i
was
saying
is
this
continued
the
captain
if
you
choose
to
put
yourself
up
to
live
with
a
fellow
like
that
on
equal
terms
one
gentleman
with
another
you
mean
put
it
so
it
do
quite
hit
it
off
but
put
it
so
why
then
you
get
your
wages
when
you
take
his
arm
and
call
him
silverbridge
i
do
want
wages
from
any
man
said
the
indignant
major
that
comes
from
not
knowing
what
wages
is
i
do
want
wages
if
i
do
a
thing
i
like
to
be
paid
for
it
you
are
paid
for
it
after
one
fashion
i
prefer
the
other
do
you
mean
he
should
give
me
a
salary
i
have
it
out
of
him
some
way
what
the
good
of
young
chaps
of
that
sort
if
they
are
made
to
pay
you
got
this
young
swell
in
tow
he
going
to
be
about
the
richest
man
in
england
and
what
the
deuce
better
are
you
for
it
tifto
sat
meditating
thinking
of
the
wisdom
which
was
being
spoken
the
same
ideas
had
occurred
to
him
the
happy
chance
which
had
made
him
intimate
with
lord
silverbridge
had
not
yet
enriched
him
what
is
the
good
of
chaps
of
that
sort
if
they
are
not
made
to
pay
the
words
were
wise
words
but
yet
how
glorious
he
had
been
when
he
was
elected
at
the
beargarden
and
had
entered
the
club
as
the
special
friend
of
the
heir
of
the
duke
of
omnium
after
a
short
pause
captain
green
pursued
his
discourse
you
said
salary
i
did
mention
the
word
salary
and
wages
is
one
a
salary
is
a
nice
thing
if
it
paid
regular
i
had
a
salary
once
myself
for
looking
after
a
stud
of
at
newmarket
only
the
gentleman
broke
up
and
it
never
went
very
far
was
that
marley
bullock
yes
that
was
marley
bullock
he
abroad
somewhere
now
with
nothing
a
year
paid
quarterly
to
live
on
i
think
he
does
a
little
at
cards
he
had
a
good
bit
of
money
once
but
most
of
it
was
gone
when
he
came
my
way
you
did
make
by
him
i
did
lose
nothing
i
did
have
a
lot
of
under
me
without
getting
something
out
of
it
what
am
i
to
do
asked
tifto
i
can
sell
him
a
horse
now
and
again
but
if
i
give
him
anything
good
there
is
much
to
come
out
of
that
very
little
i
should
say
do
he
put
his
money
on
his
not
very
free
i
think
he
coming
out
freer
now
what
did
he
stand
to
win
on
the
derby
a
thousand
or
two
perhaps
there
may
be
something
got
handsome
out
of
that
said
the
captain
not
venturing
to
allow
his
voice
to
rise
above
a
whisper
major
tifto
looked
hard
at
him
but
said
nothing
of
course
you
must
see
your
way
i
do
quite
understand
race
are
expensive
animals
and
races
generally
is
expensive
that
true
when
so
much
is
dropped
somebody
has
to
pick
it
up
that
what
i
always
said
to
myself
i
as
honest
as
another
man
that
of
course
said
the
major
civilly
but
if
i
do
keep
my
mouth
shut
somebody
have
my
teeth
out
of
my
head
every
one
for
himself
and
god
for
us
all
i
suppose
a
deal
of
money
flying
about
he
put
a
lot
of
money
on
this
of
yours
for
the
leger
if
he
managed
right
there
more
to
be
got
out
of
that
than
calling
him
silverbridge
and
walking
business
is
business
i
do
know
whether
i
make
myself
understood
the
gentleman
did
not
quite
make
himself
understood
but
tifto
endeavoured
to
read
the
riddle
he
must
in
some
way
make
money
out
of
his
friend
lord
silverbridge
hitherto
he
had
contented
himself
with
the
brilliancy
of
the
connection
but
now
his
brilliant
friend
had
taken
to
snubbing
him
and
had
on
more
than
one
occasion
made
himself
disagreeable
it
seemed
to
him
that
captain
green
counselled
him
to
put
up
with
that
but
counselled
him
at
the
same
time
to
pick
up
some
of
his
friend
money
he
did
think
that
he
could
ask
lord
silverbridge
for
a
salary
he
who
was
a
master
of
and
a
member
of
the
beargarden
then
his
friend
had
suggested
something
about
the
young
lord
bets
he
was
endeavouring
to
unriddle
all
this
with
a
brain
that
was
already
somewhat
muddled
with
alcohol
when
captain
green
got
up
from
his
chair
and
standing
over
the
major
spoke
his
last
words
for
that
night
as
from
an
oracle
square
is
all
very
well
as
long
as
others
are
square
to
you
but
when
they
are
then
i
say
square
be
d
square
what
comes
of
it
work
your
heart
out
and
then
it
no
good
the
major
thought
about
it
much
that
night
and
was
thinking
about
it
still
when
he
awoke
on
the
next
morning
he
would
like
to
make
lord
silverbridge
pay
for
his
late
insolence
it
would
answer
his
purpose
to
make
a
little
money
as
he
told
himself
in
any
honest
way
at
the
present
moment
he
was
in
want
of
money
and
on
looking
into
his
affairs
declared
to
himself
that
he
had
certainly
impoverished
himself
by
his
devotion
to
lord
silverbridge
interests
at
breakfast
on
the
following
morning
he
endeavoured
to
bring
his
friend
back
to
the
subject
but
the
captain
was
cross
rather
than
oracular
everybody
he
said
ought
to
know
his
own
business
he
going
to
meddle
or
make
what
he
had
said
had
been
taken
amiss
this
was
hard
upon
tifto
who
had
taken
nothing
amiss
square
be
d
there
was
a
great
deal
in
the
lesson
there
enunciated
which
demanded
consideration
hitherto
the
major
had
fought
his
battles
with
a
certain
adherence
to
squareness
if
his
angles
had
not
all
been
perfect
angles
still
there
had
always
been
an
attempt
at
geometrical
accuracy
he
might
now
and
again
have
told
a
lie
about
a
horse
but
who
that
deals
in
horses
has
not
done
that
he
had
been
alive
to
the
value
of
underhand
information
from
but
who
wo
use
a
tip
if
he
can
get
it
he
had
lied
about
the
expense
of
his
hounds
in
order
to
enhance
the
subscription
of
his
members
those
were
things
which
everybody
did
in
his
line
but
green
had
meant
something
beyond
this
as
far
as
he
could
see
out
in
the
world
at
large
nobody
was
square
you
had
to
keep
your
mouth
shut
or
your
teeth
would
be
stolen
out
of
it
he
did
look
into
a
paper
without
seeing
that
on
all
sides
of
him
men
had
abandoned
the
idea
of
squareness
chairmen
directors
members
of
parliament
ambassadors
all
the
world
as
he
told
himself
were
trying
to
get
on
by
their
wits
he
did
see
why
he
should
be
more
square
than
anybody
else
why
had
silverbridge
taken
him
down
to
scotland
for
the
grouse
chapter
xxxvii
grex
far
away
from
all
known
places
in
the
northern
limit
of
the
craven
district
on
the
borders
of
westmorland
but
in
yorkshire
there
stands
a
large
rambling
most
picturesque
old
house
called
grex
the
people
around
call
it
the
castle
but
it
is
not
a
castle
it
is
an
old
brick
building
supposed
to
have
been
erected
in
the
days
of
james
the
first
having
oriel
windows
twisted
chimneys
long
galleries
gable
ends
a
quadrangle
of
which
the
house
surrounds
three
sides
terraces
and
but
it
is
so
sadly
out
of
repair
as
to
be
altogether
unfit
for
the
residence
of
a
gentleman
and
his
family
it
stands
not
in
a
park
for
the
land
about
it
is
divided
into
paddocks
by
low
stone
walls
but
in
the
midst
of
lovely
scenery
the
ground
rising
all
round
it
in
low
irregular
hills
or
fells
and
close
to
it
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
back
of
the
house
there
is
a
small
dark
lake
not
serenely
lovely
as
are
some
of
the
lakes
in
westmorland
but
attractive
by
the
darkness
of
its
waters
and
the
gloom
of
the
woods
around
it
this
is
the
country
seat
of
earl
grex
which
however
he
had
not
visited
for
some
years
gradually
the
place
had
got
into
such
a
condition
that
his
absence
is
not
surprising
an
owner
of
grex
with
large
means
at
his
disposal
and
with
a
taste
for
the
picturesque
to
gratify
one
who
could
afford
to
pay
for
memories
and
who
was
willing
to
pay
dearly
for
such
luxuries
might
no
doubt
restore
grex
but
the
earl
had
neither
the
money
nor
the
taste
lord
grex
had
latterly
never
gone
near
the
place
nor
was
his
son
lord
percival
fond
of
looking
upon
the
ruin
of
his
property
but
lady
mabel
loved
it
with
a
fond
love
with
all
her
lightness
of
spirit
she
was
prone
to
memories
prone
to
melancholy
prone
at
times
almost
to
seek
the
gratification
of
sorrow
year
after
year
when
the
london
season
was
over
she
would
come
down
to
grex
and
spend
a
week
or
two
amidst
its
desolation
she
was
now
going
on
to
a
seat
in
scotland
belonging
to
montacute
jones
called
killancodlem
but
she
was
in
the
meanwhile
passing
a
desolate
fortnight
at
grex
in
company
with
miss
cassewary
the
gardens
were
let
and
being
let
of
course
were
not
kept
in
further
order
than
as
profit
might
require
the
man
who
rented
them
lived
in
the
big
house
with
his
wife
and
they
on
such
occasions
as
this
would
cook
and
wait
upon
lady
mabel
lady
mabel
was
at
the
home
of
her
ancestors
and
the
faithful
miss
cass
was
with
her
but
at
the
moment
and
at
the
spot
at
which
the
reader
shall
see
her
miss
cass
was
not
with
her
she
was
sitting
on
a
rock
about
twelve
feet
above
the
lake
looking
upon
the
black
water
and
on
another
rock
a
few
feet
from
her
was
seated
frank
tregear
no
she
said
you
should
not
have
come
nothing
can
justify
it
of
course
as
you
are
here
i
could
not
refuse
to
come
out
with
you
to
make
a
fuss
about
it
would
be
the
worst
of
all
but
you
should
not
have
come
why
not
whom
does
it
hurt
it
is
a
pleasure
to
me
if
it
be
the
reverse
to
you
i
will
go
men
are
so
unmanly
they
take
such
mean
advantages
you
know
it
is
a
pleasure
to
me
to
see
you
i
had
hoped
so
but
it
is
a
pleasure
i
ought
not
to
have
at
least
not
here
that
is
what
i
do
not
understand
said
he
in
london
where
the
earl
could
bark
at
me
if
he
happened
to
find
me
i
could
see
the
inconvenience
of
it
but
here
where
there
is
nobody
but
miss
cass
there
are
a
great
many
others
there
are
the
rooks
and
stones
and
old
women
all
of
which
have
ears
but
of
what
is
there
to
be
ashamed
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
to
me
so
pleasant
as
the
companionship
of
my
friends
then
go
after
silverbridge
i
mean
to
do
so
but
i
am
taking
you
by
the
way
it
is
all
unmanly
she
said
rising
from
her
stone
you
know
that
it
is
so
friends
do
you
mean
to
say
that
it
would
make
no
difference
whether
you
were
here
with
me
or
with
miss
cass
the
greatest
difference
in
the
world
because
she
is
an
old
woman
and
i
am
a
young
one
and
because
in
intercourse
between
young
men
and
young
women
there
is
something
dangerous
to
the
women
and
therefore
pleasant
to
the
men
i
never
heard
anything
more
unjust
you
can
not
think
i
desire
anything
injurious
to
you
i
do
think
so
she
was
still
standing
and
spoke
now
with
great
vehemence
i
do
think
so
you
force
me
to
throw
aside
the
reticence
i
ought
to
keep
would
it
help
me
in
my
prospects
if
your
friend
lord
silverbridge
knew
that
i
was
here
how
should
he
know
but
if
he
did
do
you
suppose
that
i
want
to
have
visits
paid
to
me
of
which
i
am
afraid
to
speak
would
you
dare
to
tell
lady
mary
that
you
had
been
sitting
alone
with
me
on
the
rocks
at
grex
certainly
i
would
then
it
would
be
because
you
have
not
dared
to
tell
her
certain
other
things
which
have
gone
before
you
have
sworn
to
her
no
doubt
that
you
love
her
better
than
all
the
world
i
have
and
you
have
taken
the
trouble
to
come
here
to
tell
me
that
to
wound
me
to
the
core
by
saying
so
to
show
me
that
though
i
may
still
be
sick
you
have
recovered
that
is
if
you
ever
suffered
go
your
way
and
let
me
go
mine
i
do
not
want
you
mabel
i
do
not
want
you
i
know
you
will
not
help
me
but
you
need
not
destroy
me
you
know
that
you
are
wronging
me
no
you
understand
it
all
though
you
look
so
calm
i
hate
your
lady
mary
palliser
there
but
if
by
anything
i
could
do
i
could
secure
her
to
you
i
would
do
it
because
you
want
it
she
will
be
your
probably
never
it
will
never
be
so
why
do
you
hate
her
there
again
you
are
so
little
of
a
man
that
you
can
ask
me
why
then
she
turned
away
as
though
she
intended
to
go
down
to
the
marge
of
the
lake
but
he
rose
up
and
stopped
her
let
us
have
this
out
mabel
before
we
go
he
said
unmanly
is
a
heavy
word
to
hear
from
you
and
you
have
used
it
a
dozen
times
it
is
because
i
have
thought
it
a
thousand
times
go
and
get
her
if
you
can
but
why
tell
me
about
it
you
said
you
would
help
me
so
i
would
as
i
would
help
you
do
anything
you
might
want
but
you
can
hardly
think
that
after
what
has
passed
i
can
wish
to
hear
about
her
it
was
you
spoke
of
her
i
told
you
you
should
not
be
here
because
of
her
and
because
of
me
and
i
tell
you
again
i
hate
her
do
you
think
i
can
hear
you
speak
of
her
as
though
she
were
the
only
woman
you
had
ever
seen
without
feeling
it
did
you
ever
swear
that
you
loved
any
one
else
certainly
i
have
so
sworn
have
you
ever
said
that
nothing
could
alter
that
love
indeed
i
have
but
it
is
altered
it
has
all
gone
it
has
been
transferred
to
one
who
has
more
advantages
of
beauty
youth
wealth
and
position
oh
mabel
mabel
but
it
is
so
when
you
say
this
do
you
not
think
of
yourself
yes
but
i
have
never
been
false
to
any
one
you
are
false
to
me
have
i
not
offered
to
face
all
the
world
with
you
you
would
not
offer
it
now
no
he
said
after
a
pause
not
now
were
i
to
do
so
i
should
be
false
you
bade
me
take
my
love
elsewhere
and
i
did
so
with
the
greatest
ease
we
agreed
it
should
be
so
and
you
have
done
the
same
that
is
false
look
me
in
the
face
and
tell
me
whether
you
do
not
know
it
to
be
false
and
yet
i
am
told
that
i
am
injuring
you
with
silverbridge
oh
so
unmanly
again
of
course
i
have
to
marry
who
does
not
know
it
do
you
want
to
see
me
begging
my
bread
about
the
streets
you
have
bread
or
if
not
you
might
earn
it
if
you
marry
for
money
the
accusation
is
altogether
unjustifiable
allow
me
to
finish
what
i
have
to
say
if
you
marry
for
money
you
will
do
that
which
is
in
itself
bad
and
which
is
also
unnecessary
what
other
course
would
you
recommend
me
to
take
no
one
goes
into
the
gutter
while
there
is
a
clean
path
open
if
there
be
no
escape
but
through
the
gutter
one
has
to
take
it
you
mean
that
my
duty
to
you
should
have
kept
me
from
marrying
all
my
life
not
that
but
a
little
while
frank
just
a
little
while
your
bloom
is
not
fading
your
charms
are
not
running
from
you
have
you
not
a
strength
which
i
can
not
have
do
you
not
feel
that
you
are
a
tree
standing
firm
in
the
ground
while
i
am
a
bit
of
ivy
that
will
be
trodden
in
the
dirt
unless
it
can
be
made
to
cling
to
something
you
should
not
liken
yourself
to
me
frank
if
i
could
do
you
any
good
good
what
is
the
meaning
of
good
if
you
love
it
is
good
to
be
loved
again
it
is
good
not
to
have
your
heart
torn
in
pieces
you
know
that
i
love
you
he
was
standing
close
to
her
and
put
out
his
hand
as
though
he
would
twine
his
arm
round
her
waist
not
for
worlds
she
said
it
belongs
to
that
palliser
girl
and
as
i
have
taught
myself
to
think
that
what
there
is
left
of
me
may
perhaps
belong
to
some
other
one
worthless
as
it
is
i
will
keep
it
for
him
i
love
you
but
there
can
be
none
of
that
softness
of
love
between
us
then
there
was
a
pause
but
as
he
did
not
speak
she
went
on
but
remember
frank
our
position
is
not
equal
you
have
got
over
your
little
complaint
it
probably
did
not
go
deep
with
you
and
you
have
found
a
cure
perhaps
there
is
a
satisfaction
in
finding
that
two
young
women
love
you
you
are
trying
to
be
cruel
to
me
why
else
should
you
be
here
you
know
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
with
all
my
strength
and
that
i
would
give
the
world
to
cure
myself
knowing
this
you
come
and
talk
to
me
of
your
passion
for
this
other
girl
i
had
hoped
we
might
both
talk
rationally
as
friends
friends
frank
tregear
i
have
been
bold
enough
to
tell
you
i
love
you
but
you
are
not
my
friend
and
can
not
be
my
friend
if
i
have
before
asked
you
to
help
me
in
this
mean
catastrophe
of
mine
in
my
attack
upon
that
poor
boy
i
withdraw
my
request
i
think
i
will
go
back
to
the
house
now
i
will
walk
back
to
ledburgh
if
you
wish
it
without
going
to
the
house
again
no
i
will
have
nothing
that
looks
like
being
ashamed
you
ought
not
to
have
come
but
you
need
not
run
away
then
they
walked
back
to
the
house
together
and
found
miss
cassewary
on
the
terrace
we
have
been
to
the
lake
said
mabel
and
have
been
talking
of
old
days
i
have
but
one
ambition
now
in
the
world
of
course
miss
cassewary
asked
what
the
remaining
ambition
was
to
get
money
enough
to
purchase
this
place
from
the
ruins
of
the
grex
property
if
i
could
own
the
house
and
the
lake
and
the
paddocks
about
and
had
enough
income
to
keep
one
servant
and
bread
for
us
to
eat
of
course
including
you
miss
cass
my
dear
but
i
am
not
sure
i
should
like
it
yes
you
would
frank
would
come
and
see
us
perhaps
once
a
year
i
do
suppose
anybody
else
cares
about
the
place
but
to
me
it
is
the
dearest
spot
in
the
world
so
she
went
on
in
almost
high
spirits
though
alluding
to
the
general
decadence
of
the
grex
family
till
tregear
took
his
leave
i
wish
he
had
not
come
said
miss
cassewary
when
he
was
gone
why
should
you
wish
that
there
is
not
so
much
here
to
amuse
me
that
you
should
begrudge
me
a
stray
visitor
i
do
think
that
i
grudge
you
anything
in
the
way
of
pleasure
my
dear
but
still
he
should
not
have
come
my
lord
if
he
knew
it
would
be
angry
then
let
him
be
angry
papa
does
not
do
so
much
for
me
that
i
am
bound
to
think
of
him
at
every
turn
but
i
am
or
rather
i
am
bound
to
think
of
myself
if
i
take
his
bread
bread
well
i
do
take
his
bread
and
i
take
it
on
the
understanding
that
i
will
be
to
you
what
a
mother
might
be
or
an
aunt
well
and
if
so
had
i
a
mother
living
would
not
frank
tregear
have
come
to
visit
her
and
in
visiting
her
would
he
not
have
seen
me
and
should
we
not
have
walked
out
together
not
after
all
that
has
come
and
gone
but
you
are
not
a
mother
nor
yet
an
aunt
and
you
have
to
do
just
what
i
tell
you
and
do
i
know
that
you
trust
me
in
all
things
and
am
i
not
trustworthy
i
think
you
are
trustworthy
i
know
what
my
duty
is
and
i
mean
to
do
it
no
one
shall
ever
have
to
say
of
me
that
i
have
given
way
to
i
help
his
coming
you
know
that
same
night
after
miss
cassewary
had
gone
to
bed
when
the
moon
was
high
in
the
heavens
and
the
world
around
her
was
all
asleep
lady
mabel
again
wandered
out
to
the
lake
and
again
seated
herself
on
the
same
rock
and
there
she
sat
thinking
of
her
past
life
and
trying
to
think
of
that
before
her
it
is
so
much
easier
to
think
of
the
past
than
of
the
future
to
remember
what
has
been
than
to
resolve
what
shall
be
she
had
reminded
him
of
the
offer
which
he
had
made
and
repeated
to
her
more
than
once
to
share
with
her
all
his
chances
in
life
there
would
have
been
almost
no
income
for
them
all
the
world
would
have
been
against
her
she
would
have
caused
his
ruin
her
light
on
the
matter
had
been
so
clear
that
it
had
not
taken
her
very
long
to
decide
that
such
a
thing
must
not
be
thought
of
she
had
at
last
been
quite
stern
in
her
decision
now
she
was
because
she
found
that
he
had
left
her
in
very
truth
oh
yes
she
would
marry
the
boy
if
she
could
so
arrange
since
that
meeting
at
richmond
he
had
sent
her
the
ring
reset
she
was
to
meet
him
down
in
scotland
within
a
week
or
two
from
the
present
time
montacute
jones
had
managed
that
he
had
all
but
offered
to
her
a
second
time
at
richmond
but
all
that
would
not
serve
to
make
her
happy
she
declared
to
herself
that
she
did
not
wish
to
see
frank
tregear
again
but
still
it
was
a
misery
to
her
that
his
heart
should
in
truth
be
given
to
another
woman
chapter
xxxviii
almost
at
the
last
moment
silverbridge
and
his
brother
gerald
were
induced
to
join
lord
popplecourt
in
scotland
the
party
perhaps
might
more
properly
be
called
the
party
of
reginald
dobbes
who
was
a
man
knowing
in
such
matters
it
was
he
who
made
the
party
up
popplecourt
and
silverbridge
were
to
share
the
expense
between
them
each
bringing
three
guns
silverbridge
brought
his
brother
and
frank
tregear
having
refused
a
most
piteous
petition
on
the
subject
from
major
tifto
with
popplecourt
of
course
came
reginald
dobbes
who
was
in
truth
to
manage
everything
and
lord
nidderdale
whose
wife
had
generously
permitted
him
this
recreation
the
shooting
was
in
the
west
of
perthshire
known
as
and
comprised
an
enormous
acreage
of
forest
and
moor
dobbes
declared
that
nothing
like
it
had
as
yet
been
produced
in
scotland
everything
had
been
made
to
give
way
to
deer
and
grouse
the
thing
had
been
managed
so
well
that
the
tourist
nuisance
had
been
considerably
abated
there
was
hardly
a
potato
patch
left
in
the
district
nor
a
head
of
cattle
to
be
seen
there
were
no
inhabitants
remaining
or
so
few
that
they
could
be
absorbed
in
or
cognate
duties
reginald
dobbes
who
was
very
great
at
grouse
and
supposed
to
be
capable
of
outwitting
a
deer
by
venatical
wiles
more
perfectly
than
any
other
sportsman
in
great
britain
regarded
as
the
nearest
thing
there
was
to
a
paradise
on
earth
could
he
have
been
allowed
to
pass
one
or
two
special
laws
for
his
own
protection
there
might
still
have
been
improvement
he
would
like
the
right
to
have
all
intruders
thrashed
by
the
gillies
within
an
inch
of
their
lives
and
he
would
have
had
a
clause
in
his
lease
against
the
making
of
any
new
roads
opening
of
footpaths
or
building
of
bridges
he
had
seen
somewhere
in
print
a
plan
for
running
a
railway
from
callender
to
fort
augustus
right
through
if
this
were
done
in
his
time
the
beauty
of
the
world
would
be
over
reginald
dobbes
was
a
man
of
about
forty
strong
active
about
five
feet
ten
in
height
with
broad
shoulders
and
legs
he
was
not
a
handsome
man
having
a
protrusive
nose
high
and
long
upper
lip
but
there
was
a
manliness
about
his
face
which
redeemed
it
sport
was
the
business
of
his
life
and
he
thoroughly
despised
all
who
were
not
sportsmen
he
fished
and
shot
and
hunted
during
nine
or
ten
months
of
the
year
filling
up
his
time
as
best
he
might
with
coaching
polo
and
he
regarded
it
as
a
great
duty
to
keep
his
body
in
the
firmest
possible
condition
all
his
eating
and
all
his
drinking
was
done
upon
a
system
and
he
would
consider
himself
to
be
guilty
of
weak
were
he
to
allow
himself
to
break
through
sanitary
rules
but
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
his
whole
life
was
one
of
he
could
walk
his
thirty
miles
with
his
gun
on
his
shoulder
as
well
now
as
he
could
ten
years
ago
and
being
sure
of
this
was
thoroughly
contented
with
himself
he
had
a
patrimony
amounting
to
perhaps
a
year
which
he
husbanded
so
as
to
enjoy
all
his
amusements
to
perfection
no
one
had
ever
heard
of
his
sponging
on
his
friends
of
money
he
rarely
spoke
sport
being
in
his
estimation
the
only
subject
worthy
of
a
man
words
such
was
reginald
dobbes
who
was
now
to
be
the
master
of
the
shooting
at
was
but
twelve
miles
from
killancodlem
montacute
jones
highland
seat
and
it
was
this
vicinity
which
first
induced
lord
silverbridge
to
join
the
party
mabel
grex
was
to
be
at
killancodlem
and
determined
as
he
still
was
to
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
he
would
make
this
his
opportunity
of
real
opportunity
there
had
been
none
at
richmond
since
he
had
had
his
ring
altered
and
had
sent
it
to
her
there
had
come
but
a
word
or
two
of
answer
what
am
i
to
say
you
unkindest
of
men
to
keep
it
or
to
send
it
back
would
make
me
equally
miserable
i
shall
keep
it
till
you
are
married
and
then
give
it
to
your
wife
this
affair
of
the
ring
had
made
him
more
intent
than
ever
after
that
he
heard
that
isabel
boncassen
would
also
be
at
killancodlem
having
been
induced
to
join
montacute
jones
swarm
of
visitors
though
he
was
dangerously
devoid
of
experience
still
he
felt
that
this
was
unfortunate
he
intended
to
marry
mabel
grex
and
he
could
assure
himself
that
he
thoroughly
loved
her
nevertheless
he
liked
making
love
to
isabel
boncassen
he
was
quite
willing
to
marry
and
settle
down
and
looked
forward
with
satisfaction
to
having
mabel
grex
for
his
wife
but
it
would
be
pleasant
to
have
a
run
of
flirting
and
before
this
settlement
and
he
had
certainly
never
seen
any
one
with
whom
this
would
be
so
delightful
as
with
miss
boncassen
but
that
the
two
ladies
should
be
at
the
same
house
was
unfortunate
he
and
gerald
reached
late
on
the
evening
of
august
and
found
reginald
dobbes
alone
that
was
on
wednesday
popplecourt
and
nidderdale
ought
to
have
made
their
appearance
on
that
morning
but
had
telegraphed
to
say
that
they
would
be
detained
two
days
on
their
route
tregear
whom
hitherto
dobbes
had
never
seen
had
left
his
arrival
uncertain
this
carelessness
on
such
matters
was
very
offensive
to
dobbes
who
loved
discipline
and
exactitude
he
ought
to
have
received
the
two
young
men
with
open
arms
because
they
were
punctual
but
he
had
been
somewhat
angered
by
what
he
considered
the
extreme
youth
of
lord
gerald
boys
who
could
not
shoot
were
he
thought
putting
themselves
forward
before
their
time
and
silverbridge
himself
was
by
no
means
a
shot
such
a
one
as
silverbridge
had
to
be
endured
because
from
his
position
and
wealth
he
could
facilitate
such
arrangements
as
these
it
was
much
to
have
to
do
with
a
man
who
would
not
complain
if
an
extra
fifty
pounds
were
wanted
but
he
ought
to
have
understood
that
he
was
bound
in
honour
to
bring
down
competent
friends
of
shooting
dobbes
had
been
able
to
learn
nothing
lord
gerald
was
a
lad
from
the
universities
and
dobbes
hated
university
lads
popplecourt
and
nidderdale
were
known
to
be
efficient
they
were
men
who
could
work
hard
and
do
their
part
of
the
required
slaughter
dobbes
proudly
knew
that
he
could
make
up
for
some
deficiency
by
his
own
prowess
but
he
could
not
struggle
against
three
bad
guns
what
was
the
use
of
so
perfecting
as
to
make
it
the
best
bit
of
ground
for
grouse
and
deer
in
scotland
if
the
men
who
came
there
failed
by
their
own
incapacity
to
bring
up
the
grand
total
of
killed
to
a
figure
which
would
render
dobbes
and
famous
throughout
the
whole
shooting
world
he
had
been
hard
at
work
on
other
matters
dogs
had
gone
amiss
or
guns
and
he
had
been
made
angry
by
the
champagne
which
popplecourt
caused
to
be
sent
down
he
knew
what
champagne
meant
and
not
much
of
it
was
the
liquor
which
reginald
dobbes
loved
in
the
mountains
do
you
call
this
a
very
ugly
country
silverbridge
asked
as
soon
as
he
arrived
now
it
is
the
case
that
the
traveller
who
travels
into
argyllshire
perthshire
and
inverness
expects
to
find
lovely
scenery
and
it
was
also
true
that
the
country
through
which
they
had
passed
for
the
last
twenty
miles
had
been
not
only
bleak
and
barren
but
uninteresting
and
ugly
it
was
all
rough
open
moorland
never
rising
into
mountains
and
graced
by
no
running
streams
by
no
forest
scenery
almost
by
no
foliage
the
lodge
itself
did
indeed
stand
close
upon
a
little
river
and
was
reached
by
a
bridge
that
crossed
it
but
there
was
nothing
pretty
either
in
the
river
or
the
bridge
it
was
a
placid
black
little
streamlet
which
in
that
portion
of
its
course
was
hurried
by
no
steepness
had
no
broken
rocks
in
its
bed
no
trees
on
its
low
banks
and
played
none
of
those
gambols
which
make
running
water
beautiful
the
bridge
was
a
simple
low
construction
with
a
low
parapet
carrying
an
ordinary
roadway
up
to
the
hall
door
the
lodge
itself
was
as
ugly
as
a
house
could
be
white
of
two
stories
with
the
door
in
the
middle
and
windows
on
each
side
with
a
slate
roof
and
without
a
tree
near
it
it
was
in
the
middle
of
the
shooting
and
did
not
create
a
town
around
itself
as
do
sumptuous
mansions
to
the
great
detriment
of
that
seclusion
which
is
favourable
to
game
look
at
killancodlem
dobbes
had
been
heard
to
say
a
very
fine
house
for
ladies
to
flirt
in
but
if
you
find
a
deer
within
six
miles
of
it
i
will
eat
him
first
and
shoot
him
afterwards
there
was
a
spartan
simplicity
about
which
pleased
the
spartan
mind
of
reginald
dobbes
ugly
do
you
call
it
infernally
ugly
said
lord
gerald
what
did
you
expect
to
find
a
big
hotel
and
a
lot
of
cockneys
if
you
come
after
grouse
you
must
come
to
what
the
grouse
thinks
pretty
nevertheless
it
is
ugly
said
silverbridge
who
did
not
choose
to
be
sat
upon
i
have
been
at
shootings
in
scotland
before
and
sometimes
they
are
not
ugly
this
i
call
beastly
whereupon
reginald
dobbes
turned
upon
his
heel
and
walked
away
can
you
shoot
he
said
afterwards
to
lord
gerald
i
can
fire
off
a
gun
if
you
mean
that
said
gerald
you
have
never
shot
much
not
what
you
call
very
much
i
not
so
old
as
you
are
you
know
everything
must
have
a
beginning
dobbes
wished
the
beginning
might
have
taken
place
elsewhere
but
there
had
been
some
truth
in
the
remark
what
on
earth
made
you
tell
him
crammers
like
that
asked
silverbridge
as
the
brothers
sat
together
afterwards
smoking
on
the
wall
of
the
bridge
because
he
made
an
ass
of
himself
asking
me
whether
i
could
shoot
on
the
next
morning
they
started
at
seven
dobbes
had
determined
to
be
cross
because
as
he
thought
the
young
men
would
certainly
keep
him
waiting
and
was
cross
because
by
their
punctuality
they
robbed
him
of
any
just
cause
for
offence
during
the
morning
on
the
moor
they
were
hardly
ever
near
enough
each
other
for
much
conversation
and
very
little
was
said
according
to
arrangement
made
they
returned
to
the
house
for
lunch
it
being
their
purpose
not
to
go
far
from
home
till
their
numbers
were
complete
as
they
came
over
the
bridge
and
put
down
their
guns
near
the
door
dobbes
spoke
the
first
word
they
had
heard
from
his
lips
why
did
you
tell
me
such
an
infernal
i
would
say
lie
only
perhaps
you
might
like
it
i
told
you
no
lie
said
gerald
you
only
missed
two
birds
all
the
morning
and
you
have
shot
that
uncommonly
good
sport
what
have
you
done
only
forty
and
dobbes
seemed
for
the
moment
to
be
gratified
by
his
own
inferiority
you
are
a
deuced
sight
better
than
your
brother
gerald
about
the
best
shot
i
know
said
silverbridge
why
did
he
tell
because
you
were
angry
when
we
said
the
place
was
ugly
i
see
all
about
it
said
dobbes
nevertheless
when
a
fellow
comes
to
shoot
he
should
complain
because
a
place
is
pretty
what
you
want
is
a
decent
house
as
near
as
you
can
have
it
to
your
ground
if
there
is
anything
in
scotland
to
beat
i
do
know
where
to
find
it
shooting
is
shooting
you
know
and
touring
is
touring
upon
that
he
took
very
kindly
to
lord
gerald
who
even
after
the
arrival
of
the
other
men
was
second
only
in
skill
to
dobbes
himself
with
nidderdale
who
was
an
old
companion
he
got
on
very
well
nidderdale
ate
and
drank
too
much
and
refused
to
be
driven
beyond
a
certain
amount
of
labour
but
was
in
other
respects
obedient
and
knew
what
he
was
about
popplecourt
was
disagreeable
but
he
was
a
fairly
good
shot
and
understood
what
was
expected
of
him
silverbridge
was
so
that
even
his
manifest
faults
shooting
carelessly
lying
in
bed
and
wanting
his
dinner
were
if
not
forgiven
at
least
endured
but
tregear
was
an
abomination
he
could
shoot
well
enough
and
was
active
and
when
he
was
at
the
work
seemed
to
like
it
but
he
would
stay
away
whole
days
by
himself
and
when
spoken
to
would
answer
in
a
manner
which
seemed
to
dobbes
to
be
flat
mutiny
we
are
not
doing
it
for
our
bread
said
tregear
i
do
know
what
you
mean
there
no
duty
in
killing
a
certain
number
of
these
animals
they
had
been
driving
deer
on
the
day
before
and
were
to
continue
the
work
on
the
day
in
question
i
not
paid
fifteen
shillings
a
week
for
doing
it
i
suppose
if
you
undertake
to
do
a
thing
you
mean
to
do
it
of
course
you
not
wanted
we
can
make
the
double
party
without
you
then
why
the
mischief
should
you
growl
at
me
because
i
think
a
man
should
do
what
he
undertakes
to
do
a
man
who
gets
tired
after
three
days
work
of
this
kind
would
become
tired
if
he
were
earning
his
bread
who
says
i
am
tired
i
came
here
to
amuse
myself
amuse
yourself
and
as
long
as
it
amuses
me
i
shall
shoot
and
when
it
does
not
i
shall
give
it
up
this
vexed
the
governor
of
much
he
had
learned
to
regard
himself
as
the
arbiter
of
the
fate
of
men
while
they
were
sojourning
under
the
same
autumnal
roof
as
himself
but
a
defalcation
which
occurred
immediately
afterwards
was
worse
silverbridge
declared
his
intention
of
going
over
one
morning
to
killancodlem
reginald
dobbes
muttered
a
curse
between
his
teeth
which
was
visible
by
the
anger
on
his
brow
to
all
the
party
i
shall
be
back
you
know
said
silverbridge
a
lot
of
men
and
women
who
pretend
to
come
there
for
shooting
said
dobbes
angrily
but
do
all
the
mischief
they
can
one
must
go
and
see
one
friends
you
know
some
girl
said
dobbes
but
worse
happened
than
the
evil
so
lightly
mentioned
silverbridge
did
go
over
to
killancodlem
and
presently
there
came
back
a
man
with
a
cart
who
was
to
return
with
a
certain
not
small
proportion
of
his
luggage
it
hardly
honest
you
know
said
reginald
dobbes
chapter
xxxix
killancodlem
dobbes
was
probably
right
in
his
opinion
that
hotels
tourists
and
congregations
of
men
are
detrimental
to
shooting
was
in
all
respects
suited
for
sport
killancodlem
though
it
had
the
name
of
a
certainly
was
not
so
men
going
there
took
their
guns
gamekeepers
were
provided
and
gillies
and
in
a
moderate
quantity
game
on
certain
grand
days
a
deer
or
two
might
be
shot
and
would
be
very
much
talked
about
afterwards
but
a
glance
at
the
place
would
suffice
to
show
that
killancodlem
was
not
intended
for
sport
it
was
a
fine
castellated
mansion
with
beautiful
though
narrow
grounds
standing
in
the
valley
of
the
archay
river
with
a
mountain
behind
and
the
river
in
front
between
the
gates
and
the
river
there
was
a
public
road
on
which
a
ran
with
horns
and
the
noise
of
many
tourists
a
mile
beyond
the
castle
was
the
famous
killancodlem
hotel
which
made
up
a
hundred
and
twenty
beds
and
at
which
half
as
many
more
guests
would
sleep
on
occasions
under
the
tables
and
there
was
the
killancodlem
halfway
between
the
two
at
they
had
to
send
nine
miles
for
their
letters
and
newspapers
at
killancodlem
there
was
and
a
and
dancing
every
night
the
costumes
of
the
ladies
were
lovely
and
those
of
the
gentlemen
who
were
wonderful
in
knickerbockers
picturesque
hats
and
variegated
stockings
hardly
less
so
and
then
there
were
carriages
and
and
paths
had
been
made
hither
and
thither
through
the
rocks
and
hills
for
the
sake
of
the
scenery
scenery
to
hear
dobbes
utter
the
single
word
was
as
good
as
a
play
was
it
for
such
cockney
purposes
as
those
that
scotland
had
been
created
fit
mother
for
grouse
and
deer
silverbridge
arrived
just
before
lunch
and
was
soon
made
to
understand
that
it
was
impossible
that
he
should
go
back
that
day
jones
was
very
great
on
that
occasion
you
are
afraid
of
reginald
dobbes
she
said
severely
i
think
i
am
rather
of
course
you
are
how
came
it
to
pass
that
you
of
all
men
should
submit
yourself
to
such
a
tyrant
good
shooting
you
know
said
silverbridge
but
you
dare
not
call
an
hour
your
own
or
your
soul
dobbes
and
i
are
sworn
enemies
we
both
like
scotland
and
unfortunately
we
have
fallen
into
the
same
neighbourhood
he
looks
upon
me
as
the
genius
of
sloth
i
regard
him
as
the
incarnation
of
tyranny
he
once
said
there
should
be
no
women
in
scotland
just
an
old
one
here
and
there
who
would
know
how
to
cook
grouse
i
offered
to
go
and
cook
his
grouse
any
friend
of
mine
continued
jones
who
comes
down
to
without
staying
a
day
or
two
with
me
will
never
be
my
friend
any
more
i
do
not
hesitate
to
tell
you
lord
silverbridge
that
i
call
for
your
surrender
in
order
that
i
may
show
my
power
over
reginald
dobbes
are
you
a
dobbite
not
said
silverbridge
then
be
a
montacute
or
a
boncassenite
if
as
is
possible
you
prefer
a
young
woman
to
an
old
one
at
this
moment
isabel
boncassen
was
standing
close
to
them
killancodlem
against
for
ever
said
miss
boncassen
waving
her
handkerchief
as
a
matter
of
course
a
messenger
was
sent
back
to
for
the
young
lord
wearing
apparel
the
whole
of
that
afternoon
he
spent
playing
with
miss
boncassen
lady
mabel
was
asked
to
join
the
party
but
she
refused
having
promised
to
take
a
walk
to
a
distant
waterfall
where
the
codlem
falls
into
the
archay
a
gentleman
in
knickerbockers
was
to
have
gone
with
her
and
two
other
young
ladies
but
when
the
time
came
she
was
weary
she
said
and
she
sat
almost
the
entire
afternoon
looking
at
the
game
from
a
distance
silverbridge
played
well
but
not
so
well
as
the
pretty
american
with
them
were
joined
two
others
somewhat
inferior
so
that
silverbridge
and
miss
boncassen
were
on
different
sides
they
played
game
after
game
and
miss
boncassen
side
always
won
very
little
was
said
between
silverbridge
and
miss
boncassen
which
did
not
refer
to
the
game
but
lady
mabel
looking
on
told
herself
that
they
were
making
love
to
each
other
before
her
eyes
and
why
should
they
she
asked
herself
that
question
in
perfect
good
faith
why
should
they
not
be
lovers
was
ever
anything
prettier
than
the
girl
in
her
country
dress
active
as
a
fawn
and
as
graceful
or
could
anything
be
more
handsome
more
attractive
to
a
girl
more
or
better
bred
in
his
playful
emulation
than
silverbridge
when
youth
and
pleasure
meet
to
chase
the
glowing
hours
with
flying
feet
she
said
to
herself
over
and
over
again
but
why
had
he
sent
her
the
ring
she
would
certainly
give
him
back
the
ring
and
bid
him
bestow
it
at
once
upon
miss
boncassen
inconstant
boy
then
she
would
get
up
and
wander
away
for
a
time
and
rebuke
herself
what
right
had
she
even
to
think
of
inconstancy
could
she
be
so
irrational
so
unjust
as
to
be
sick
for
his
love
as
to
be
angry
with
him
because
he
seemed
to
prefer
another
was
she
not
well
aware
that
she
herself
did
not
love
him
but
that
she
did
love
another
man
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
marry
him
in
order
that
she
might
be
a
duchess
and
because
she
could
give
herself
to
him
without
any
of
that
horror
which
would
be
her
fate
in
submitting
to
matrimony
with
one
or
another
of
the
young
men
around
her
there
might
be
disappointment
if
he
escaped
her
there
would
be
bitter
disappointment
but
seeing
how
it
was
had
she
any
further
ground
for
hope
she
certainly
had
no
ground
for
anger
it
was
thus
within
her
own
bosom
she
put
questions
to
herself
and
yet
all
this
before
her
was
simply
a
game
of
play
in
which
the
girl
and
the
young
man
were
as
eager
for
victory
as
though
they
were
children
they
were
thinking
neither
of
love
nor
that
the
girl
should
be
so
lovely
was
no
doubt
a
pleasure
to
him
and
perhaps
to
her
also
that
he
should
be
joyous
to
look
at
and
sweet
of
voice
but
he
could
he
have
been
made
to
tell
all
the
truth
within
him
would
have
still
owned
that
it
was
his
purpose
to
make
mabel
his
wife
when
the
game
was
over
and
the
propositions
made
for
further
matches
and
the
like
miss
boncassen
said
that
she
would
betake
herself
to
her
own
room
i
never
worked
so
hard
in
my
life
before
she
said
and
i
feel
like
a
navvie
i
could
drink
beer
out
of
a
jug
and
eat
bread
and
cheese
i
wo
play
with
you
any
more
lord
silverbridge
because
i
am
beginning
to
think
it
is
unladylike
to
exert
myself
are
you
not
glad
you
came
over
said
lady
mabel
to
him
as
he
was
going
off
the
ground
almost
without
seeing
her
pretty
well
he
said
is
not
that
better
than
stalking
yes
with
miss
boncassen
she
plays
uncommonly
well
and
so
do
you
ah
she
has
such
an
eye
for
distances
and
you
what
have
you
an
eye
for
will
you
answer
me
a
question
well
yes
i
think
so
truly
certainly
if
i
do
answer
it
do
you
not
think
her
the
most
beautiful
creature
you
ever
saw
in
your
life
he
pushed
back
his
cap
and
looked
at
her
without
making
any
immediate
answer
i
do
now
tell
me
what
you
think
i
think
that
perhaps
she
is
i
knew
you
would
say
so
you
are
so
honest
that
you
could
not
bring
yourself
to
tell
a
fib
even
to
me
about
that
come
here
and
sit
down
for
a
moment
of
course
he
sat
down
by
her
you
know
that
frank
came
to
see
me
at
grex
he
never
mentioned
it
dear
me
how
odd
it
was
odd
said
he
in
a
voice
which
showed
that
he
was
angry
she
could
hardly
explain
to
herself
why
she
told
him
this
at
the
present
moment
it
came
partly
from
jealousy
as
though
she
had
said
to
herself
though
he
may
neglect
me
he
shall
know
that
there
is
someone
who
does
not
and
partly
from
an
eager
feeling
that
she
would
have
nothing
concealed
there
were
moments
with
her
in
which
she
thought
that
she
could
arrange
her
future
life
in
accordance
with
certain
wise
rules
over
which
her
heart
should
have
no
influence
there
were
others
many
others
in
which
her
feelings
completely
got
the
better
of
her
and
now
she
told
herself
that
she
would
be
afraid
of
nothing
there
should
be
no
deceit
no
lies
he
went
to
see
you
at
grex
said
silverbridge
why
should
he
not
have
come
to
me
at
grex
only
it
is
so
odd
that
he
did
not
mention
it
it
seems
to
me
that
he
is
always
having
secrets
with
you
of
some
kind
poor
frank
there
is
no
one
else
who
would
come
to
see
me
at
that
tumbledown
old
place
but
i
have
another
thing
to
say
to
you
you
have
behaved
badly
to
me
have
i
yes
sir
after
my
folly
about
that
ring
you
should
have
known
better
than
to
send
it
to
me
you
must
take
it
back
again
you
shall
do
exactly
what
you
said
you
would
you
shall
give
it
to
my
wife
when
i
have
one
that
did
very
well
for
me
to
say
in
a
note
i
did
not
want
to
send
my
anger
to
you
over
a
distance
of
two
or
three
hundred
miles
by
the
postman
but
now
that
we
are
together
you
must
take
it
back
i
will
do
no
such
thing
said
he
sturdily
you
speak
as
though
this
were
a
matter
in
which
you
can
have
your
own
way
i
mean
to
have
mine
about
that
any
lady
then
must
be
forced
to
take
any
present
that
a
gentleman
may
send
her
allow
me
to
assure
you
that
the
usages
of
society
do
not
run
in
that
direction
here
is
the
ring
i
knew
that
you
would
come
over
to
see
well
to
see
someone
here
and
i
have
kept
it
ready
in
my
pocket
i
came
over
to
see
you
lord
silverbridge
but
we
know
that
in
certain
employments
all
things
are
fair
he
looked
at
her
not
knowing
what
were
the
employments
to
which
she
alluded
at
any
rate
you
will
oblige
me
by
by
by
not
being
troublesome
and
putting
this
little
trinket
into
your
pocket
never
nothing
on
earth
shall
make
me
do
it
at
killancodlem
they
did
not
dine
till
eight
twilight
was
now
stealing
on
these
two
who
were
still
out
in
the
garden
all
the
others
having
gone
in
to
dress
she
looked
round
to
see
that
no
other
eyes
were
watching
them
as
she
still
held
the
ring
it
is
there
she
said
putting
it
on
the
bench
between
them
then
she
prepared
to
rise
from
the
seat
so
that
she
might
leave
it
with
him
but
he
was
too
quick
for
her
and
was
away
at
a
distance
before
she
had
collected
her
dress
and
from
a
distance
he
spoke
again
if
you
choose
that
it
shall
be
lost
so
be
it
you
had
better
take
it
said
she
following
him
slowly
but
he
would
not
turn
back
nor
would
she
they
met
again
in
the
hall
for
a
moment
i
should
be
sorry
it
should
be
lost
said
he
because
it
belonged
to
my
and
i
had
hoped
that
i
might
live
to
see
it
very
often
you
can
fetch
it
she
said
as
she
went
to
her
room
he
however
would
not
fetch
it
she
had
accepted
it
and
he
would
not
take
it
back
again
let
the
fate
of
the
gem
be
what
it
might
but
to
the
feminine
and
more
cautious
mind
the
very
value
of
the
trinket
made
its
position
out
there
on
the
bench
within
the
grasp
of
any
dishonest
gardener
a
burden
to
her
she
could
not
reconcile
it
to
her
conscience
that
it
should
be
so
left
the
diamond
was
a
large
one
and
she
had
heard
it
spoken
of
as
a
stone
of
great
value
so
much
so
that
silverbridge
had
been
blamed
for
wearing
it
ordinarily
she
had
asked
for
it
in
joke
regarding
it
as
a
thing
which
could
not
be
given
away
she
could
not
go
down
herself
and
take
it
up
again
but
neither
could
she
allow
it
to
remain
as
she
went
to
her
room
she
met
jones
already
coming
from
hers
you
will
keep
us
all
waiting
said
the
hostess
oh
no
nobody
ever
dressed
so
quickly
but
jones
will
you
do
me
a
favour
certainly
and
will
you
let
me
explain
something
anything
you
like
from
a
hopeless
engagement
down
to
a
broken
garter
i
am
suffering
neither
from
one
or
the
other
but
there
is
a
most
valuable
ring
lying
out
in
the
garden
will
you
send
for
it
then
of
course
the
story
had
to
be
told
you
will
i
hope
understand
how
i
came
to
ask
for
it
foolishly
it
was
because
it
was
the
one
thing
which
i
was
sure
he
would
not
give
away
why
not
take
it
ca
you
understand
i
would
for
the
world
but
you
will
be
good
enough
wo
you
to
see
that
there
is
nothing
else
in
it
nothing
of
love
nothing
in
the
least
he
and
i
are
excellent
friends
we
are
cousins
and
intimate
and
all
that
i
thought
i
might
have
had
my
joke
and
now
i
am
punished
for
it
as
for
love
do
you
see
he
is
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
miss
boncassen
this
was
very
imprudent
on
the
part
of
lady
mabel
who
had
she
been
capable
of
clinging
fast
to
her
policy
would
not
now
in
a
moment
of
strong
feeling
have
done
so
much
to
raise
obstacles
in
her
own
way
but
you
will
send
for
it
wo
you
and
have
it
put
on
his
when
he
went
to
bed
lord
silverbridge
found
it
on
his
table
but
before
that
time
came
he
had
twice
danced
with
miss
boncassen
lady
mabel
having
refused
to
dance
with
him
no
she
said
i
am
angry
with
you
you
ought
to
have
felt
that
it
did
not
become
you
as
a
gentleman
to
subject
me
to
inconvenience
by
throwing
upon
me
the
charge
of
that
diamond
you
may
be
foolish
enough
to
be
indifferent
about
its
value
but
as
you
have
mixed
me
up
with
it
i
can
not
afford
to
have
it
lost
it
is
yours
no
sir
it
is
not
mine
nor
will
it
ever
be
mine
but
i
wish
you
to
understand
that
you
have
offended
me
this
made
him
so
unhappy
for
the
time
that
he
almost
told
the
story
to
miss
boncassen
if
i
were
to
give
you
a
ring
he
said
would
not
you
accept
it
what
a
question
what
i
mean
is
do
you
think
all
those
conventional
rules
about
men
and
women
are
absurd
as
a
progressive
american
of
course
i
am
bound
to
think
all
conventional
rules
are
an
abomination
if
you
had
a
brother
and
i
gave
him
a
stick
he
take
it
not
across
his
back
i
hope
or
if
i
gave
your
father
a
book
he
take
books
to
any
extent
i
should
say
and
why
not
you
a
ring
who
said
i
would
but
after
all
this
you
must
try
me
i
was
not
thinking
of
it
i
so
glad
of
that
well
if
you
promise
that
you
never
offer
me
one
i
promise
that
i
take
it
when
it
comes
but
what
does
all
this
mean
it
is
not
worth
talking
about
you
have
offered
somebody
a
ring
and
somebody
has
taken
it
may
i
guess
i
had
rather
you
did
not
i
could
you
know
never
mind
about
that
now
come
and
have
a
turn
i
am
bound
not
to
give
you
a
ring
but
you
are
bound
to
accept
anything
else
i
may
offer
no
lord
silverbridge
not
at
all
nevertheless
we
have
a
turn
that
night
before
he
went
up
to
his
room
he
had
told
isabel
boncassen
that
he
loved
her
and
when
he
spoke
he
was
telling
her
the
truth
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
mabel
had
become
hard
to
him
and
had
over
and
over
again
rejected
the
approaches
to
tenderness
which
he
had
attempted
to
make
in
his
intercourse
with
her
even
though
she
were
to
accept
him
what
would
that
be
worth
to
him
if
she
did
not
love
him
so
many
things
had
been
added
together
why
had
tregear
gone
to
grex
and
having
gone
there
why
had
he
kept
his
journey
a
secret
tregear
he
knew
was
engaged
to
his
sister
but
for
all
that
there
was
a
closer
intimacy
between
mabel
and
tregear
than
between
mabel
and
himself
and
surely
she
might
have
taken
his
ring
and
then
isabel
boncassen
was
so
perfect
since
he
had
first
met
her
he
had
heard
her
loveliness
talked
of
on
all
sides
it
seemed
to
be
admitted
everywhere
that
so
beautiful
a
creature
had
never
before
been
seen
in
london
there
is
even
a
certain
dignity
attached
to
that
which
is
praised
by
all
lips
miss
boncassen
as
an
american
girl
had
she
been
judged
to
be
beautiful
only
by
his
own
eyes
might
perhaps
have
seemed
to
him
to
be
beneath
his
serious
notice
in
such
a
case
he
might
have
felt
himself
unable
to
justify
so
extraordinary
a
choice
but
there
was
an
acclamation
of
assent
as
to
this
girl
then
came
the
dancing
the
one
dance
after
another
the
pressure
of
the
hand
the
entreaty
that
she
would
not
just
on
this
occasion
dance
with
any
other
man
the
attendance
on
her
when
she
took
her
glass
of
wine
the
whispered
encouragement
of
montacute
jones
the
and
yet
conduct
of
the
girl
i
shall
not
dance
at
all
again
she
said
when
he
asked
her
to
stand
up
for
another
think
of
all
that
this
morning
but
you
will
play
i
thought
you
were
going
of
course
i
shall
stay
now
he
said
and
as
he
said
it
he
put
his
hand
on
her
hand
which
was
on
his
arm
she
drew
it
away
at
once
i
love
you
so
dearly
he
whispered
to
her
so
dearly
lord
silverbridge
i
do
i
do
can
you
say
that
you
will
love
me
in
return
i
can
not
she
said
slowly
i
have
never
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
i
hardly
know
now
whether
you
are
in
earnest
indeed
indeed
i
am
then
i
will
say
and
think
about
it
everybody
is
going
we
will
have
our
game
at
any
rate
when
he
went
to
his
room
he
found
the
ring
on
his
chapter
xl
and
then
on
the
next
morning
miss
boncassen
did
not
appear
at
breakfast
word
came
that
she
had
been
so
fatigued
by
the
as
not
to
be
able
to
leave
her
bed
i
have
been
to
her
said
montacute
jones
whispering
to
lord
silverbridge
as
though
he
were
particularly
interested
there
nothing
really
the
matter
she
will
be
down
to
lunch
i
was
afraid
she
might
be
ill
said
silverbridge
who
was
now
hardly
anxious
to
hide
his
admiration
oh
no
nothing
of
that
sort
but
she
will
not
be
able
to
play
again
it
was
your
fault
you
should
not
have
made
her
dance
last
night
after
that
jones
said
a
word
about
it
all
to
lady
mabel
i
hope
the
duke
will
not
be
angry
with
me
why
should
he
be
angry
with
you
i
do
suppose
he
will
approve
of
it
and
perhaps
he
say
i
brought
them
together
on
purpose
soon
afterwards
mabel
asked
silverbridge
to
walk
with
her
to
the
waterfall
she
had
worked
herself
into
such
a
state
of
mind
that
she
hardly
knew
what
to
do
what
to
wish
or
how
to
act
at
one
moment
she
would
tell
herself
that
it
was
better
in
every
respect
that
she
should
cease
to
think
of
being
duchess
of
omnium
it
was
not
fit
that
she
should
think
of
it
she
herself
cared
but
little
for
the
young
man
and
he
she
would
tell
herself
now
appeared
to
care
as
little
for
her
and
yet
to
be
duchess
of
omnium
but
was
it
not
clear
that
he
was
absolutely
in
love
with
this
other
girl
she
had
played
her
cards
so
badly
that
the
game
was
now
beyond
her
powers
then
other
thoughts
would
come
was
it
beyond
her
powers
had
he
not
told
her
in
london
that
he
loved
her
had
he
not
given
her
the
ring
which
she
well
knew
he
valued
ah
if
she
could
but
have
been
aware
of
all
that
had
passed
between
silverbridge
and
the
duke
how
different
would
have
been
her
feelings
and
then
would
it
not
be
so
much
better
for
him
that
he
should
marry
her
one
of
his
own
class
than
this
american
girl
of
whom
nobody
knew
anything
and
then
to
be
the
daughter
of
the
duke
of
omnium
to
be
the
future
duchess
to
escape
from
all
the
cares
which
her
father
vices
and
follies
had
brought
upon
her
to
have
come
to
an
end
of
all
her
troubles
would
it
not
be
sweet
she
had
made
her
mind
up
to
nothing
when
she
asked
him
to
walk
up
to
the
waterfall
there
was
present
to
her
only
the
glimmer
of
an
idea
that
she
ought
to
caution
him
not
to
play
with
the
american
feelings
she
knew
herself
to
be
aware
that
when
the
time
for
her
own
action
came
her
feminine
feelings
would
get
the
better
of
her
purpose
she
could
not
craftily
bring
him
to
the
necessity
of
bestowing
himself
upon
her
had
that
been
within
the
compass
of
her
powers
opportunities
had
not
been
lacking
to
her
on
such
occasions
she
had
always
spared
him
and
should
the
opportunity
come
again
again
she
would
spare
him
but
she
might
perhaps
do
some
good
not
to
herself
that
was
now
out
of
the
question
but
to
him
by
showing
him
how
wrong
he
was
in
trifling
with
this
girl
feelings
and
so
they
started
for
their
walk
he
of
course
would
have
avoided
it
had
it
been
possible
when
men
in
such
matters
have
two
strings
to
their
bow
much
inconvenience
is
felt
when
the
two
become
entangled
silverbridge
no
doubt
had
come
over
to
killancodlem
for
the
sake
of
making
love
to
mabel
grex
and
instead
of
doing
so
he
had
made
love
to
isabel
boncassen
and
during
the
watches
of
the
night
and
as
he
had
dressed
himself
in
the
morning
and
while
jones
had
been
whispering
to
him
her
little
bulletin
as
to
the
state
of
the
young
lady
health
he
had
not
repented
himself
of
the
change
mabel
had
been
he
thought
so
little
gracious
to
him
that
he
would
have
given
up
that
notion
earlier
but
for
his
indiscreet
declaration
to
his
father
on
the
other
hand
making
love
to
isabel
boncassen
seemed
to
him
to
possess
some
divine
afflatus
of
joy
which
made
it
of
all
imaginable
occupations
the
sweetest
and
most
charming
she
had
admitted
of
no
embrace
indeed
he
had
attempted
none
unless
that
touch
of
the
hand
might
be
so
called
from
which
she
had
immediately
withdrawn
her
conduct
had
been
such
that
he
had
felt
it
to
be
incumbent
on
him
at
the
very
moment
to
justify
the
touch
by
a
declaration
of
love
then
she
had
told
him
that
she
would
not
promise
to
love
him
in
return
and
yet
it
had
been
so
sweet
so
heavenly
sweet
during
the
morning
he
had
almost
forgotten
mabel
when
jones
told
him
that
isabel
would
keep
her
room
he
longed
to
ask
for
leave
to
go
and
make
some
inquiry
at
the
door
she
would
not
play
with
him
well
he
did
not
now
care
much
for
that
after
what
he
had
said
to
her
she
must
at
any
rate
give
him
some
answer
she
had
been
so
gracious
to
him
that
his
hopes
ran
very
high
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
fancy
that
she
might
be
gracious
to
him
because
he
was
heir
to
the
dukedom
of
omnium
she
herself
was
so
infinitely
superior
to
all
wealth
to
all
rank
to
all
sublunary
arrangements
conventions
and
considerations
that
there
was
no
room
for
confidence
of
that
nature
but
he
was
confident
because
her
smile
had
been
sweet
and
her
eyes
bright
and
because
he
was
conscious
though
unconsciously
conscious
of
something
of
the
sympathy
of
love
but
he
had
to
go
to
the
waterfall
with
mabel
lady
mabel
was
always
dressed
perfectly
having
great
gifts
of
her
own
in
that
direction
there
was
a
freshness
about
her
which
made
her
morning
costume
more
charming
than
that
of
the
evening
and
never
did
she
look
so
well
as
when
arrayed
for
a
walk
on
this
occasion
she
had
certainly
done
her
best
but
he
poor
blind
idiot
saw
nothing
of
this
the
white
gauzy
fabric
which
had
covered
isabel
satin
petticoat
on
the
previous
evening
still
filled
his
eyes
those
perfect
boots
the
little
glimpses
of
stockings
above
them
the
skirt
the
jacket
fitting
but
never
binding
that
lovely
body
and
waist
the
jaunty
hat
with
its
small
fresh
feathers
all
were
nothing
to
him
nor
was
the
bright
honest
face
beneath
the
hat
anything
to
him
now
for
it
was
an
honest
face
though
misfortunes
which
had
come
had
somewhat
marred
the
honesty
of
the
heart
at
first
the
conversation
was
about
indifferent
things
killancodlem
and
jones
and
reginald
dobbes
they
had
gone
along
the
as
far
as
the
and
had
turned
up
through
the
wood
and
reached
a
seat
whence
there
was
a
beautiful
view
down
upon
the
archay
before
a
word
was
said
affecting
either
miss
boncassen
or
the
ring
you
got
the
ring
safe
she
said
oh
yes
how
could
you
be
so
foolish
as
to
risk
it
i
did
not
regard
it
as
mine
you
had
accepted
it
i
thought
but
if
i
had
and
then
repented
of
my
fault
in
doing
so
should
you
not
have
been
willing
to
help
me
in
setting
myself
right
with
myself
of
course
after
what
had
passed
it
was
a
trouble
to
me
when
it
came
what
was
i
to
do
for
a
day
or
two
i
thought
i
would
take
it
not
as
liking
to
take
it
but
as
getting
rid
of
the
trouble
in
that
way
then
i
remembered
its
value
its
history
the
fact
that
all
who
knew
you
would
want
to
know
what
had
become
of
it
and
i
felt
that
it
should
be
given
back
there
is
only
one
person
to
whom
you
must
give
it
who
is
that
he
said
quickly
your
wife
or
to
her
who
is
to
become
your
wife
no
other
woman
can
be
justified
in
accepting
such
a
present
there
has
been
a
great
deal
more
said
about
it
than
it
worth
said
he
not
anxious
at
the
present
moment
to
discuss
any
matrimonial
projects
with
her
shall
we
go
on
to
the
fall
then
she
got
up
and
led
the
way
till
they
came
to
the
little
bridge
from
which
they
could
see
the
falls
of
the
codlem
below
them
i
call
that
very
pretty
he
said
i
thought
you
would
like
it
i
never
saw
anything
of
that
kind
more
jolly
do
you
care
for
scenery
mabel
very
much
i
know
no
pleasure
equal
to
it
you
have
never
seen
grex
is
it
like
this
not
in
the
least
it
is
wilder
than
this
and
there
are
not
so
many
trees
but
to
my
eyes
it
is
very
beautiful
i
wish
you
had
seen
it
perhaps
i
may
some
day
that
is
not
likely
now
she
said
the
house
is
in
ruins
if
i
had
just
money
enough
to
keep
it
for
myself
i
think
i
could
live
alone
there
and
be
happy
you
alone
of
course
you
mean
to
marry
mean
to
marry
do
persons
marry
because
they
mean
it
with
nineteen
men
out
of
twenty
the
idea
of
marrying
them
would
convey
the
idea
of
hating
them
you
can
mean
to
marry
no
doubt
you
do
mean
it
i
suppose
i
shall
some
day
how
very
well
the
house
looks
from
here
it
was
incumbent
upon
him
at
the
present
moment
to
turn
the
conversation
but
when
she
had
a
project
in
her
head
it
was
not
so
easy
to
turn
her
away
yes
indeed
she
said
very
well
but
as
i
was
saying
you
can
mean
to
marry
anybody
can
mean
it
but
you
can
carry
out
a
purpose
what
are
you
thinking
of
doing
now
upon
my
honour
mabel
that
is
unfair
are
we
not
friends
i
think
so
dear
friends
i
hope
so
then
may
i
not
tell
you
what
i
think
if
you
do
not
mean
to
marry
that
american
young
lady
you
should
not
raise
false
hopes
false
hopes
he
had
hopes
but
he
had
never
thought
that
isabel
could
have
any
false
hopes
certainly
do
you
not
know
that
everyone
was
looking
at
you
last
night
certainly
not
and
that
that
old
woman
is
going
about
talking
of
it
as
her
doing
pretending
to
be
afraid
of
your
father
whereas
nothing
would
please
her
better
than
to
humble
a
family
so
high
as
yours
humble
exclaimed
lord
silverbridge
do
you
think
your
father
would
like
it
would
you
think
that
another
man
would
be
doing
well
for
himself
by
marrying
miss
boncassen
i
do
said
he
energetically
then
you
must
be
very
much
in
love
with
her
i
say
nothing
about
that
if
you
are
so
much
in
love
with
her
that
you
mean
to
face
the
displeasure
of
all
your
friends
i
do
not
say
what
i
mean
i
could
talk
more
freely
to
you
than
to
any
one
else
but
i
wo
talk
about
that
even
to
you
as
regards
miss
boncassen
i
think
that
any
man
might
marry
her
without
discredit
i
wo
have
it
said
that
she
can
be
inferior
to
me
or
to
anybody
there
was
a
steady
manliness
in
this
which
took
lady
mabel
by
surprise
she
was
convinced
that
he
intended
to
offer
his
hand
to
the
girl
and
now
was
actuated
chiefly
by
a
feeling
that
his
doing
so
would
be
an
outrage
to
all
english
propriety
if
a
word
might
have
an
effect
it
would
be
her
duty
to
speak
that
word
i
think
you
are
wrong
there
lord
silverbridge
i
am
sure
i
am
right
what
have
you
yourself
felt
about
your
sister
and
mr
tregear
it
is
altogether
different
altogether
frank
wife
will
be
simply
his
wife
mine
should
i
outlive
my
father
will
be
duchess
of
omnium
but
your
father
i
have
heard
you
speak
with
bitter
regret
of
this
affair
of
lady
mary
because
it
vexes
him
would
your
marriage
with
an
american
lady
vex
him
less
why
should
it
vex
him
at
all
is
she
vulgar
or
ill
to
look
at
or
stupid
think
of
her
mother
i
am
not
going
to
marry
her
mother
nor
for
the
matter
of
that
am
i
going
to
marry
her
you
are
taking
all
that
for
granted
in
a
most
unfair
way
how
can
i
help
it
after
what
i
saw
yesterday
i
will
not
talk
any
more
about
it
we
had
better
go
down
or
we
shall
get
no
lunch
lady
mabel
as
she
followed
him
tried
to
make
herself
believe
that
all
her
sorrow
came
from
regret
that
so
fine
a
scion
of
the
british
nobility
should
throw
himself
away
upon
an
american
adventuress
the
guests
were
still
at
lunch
when
they
entered
the
and
isabel
was
seated
close
to
jones
silverbridge
at
once
went
up
to
her
and
place
was
made
for
him
as
though
he
had
almost
a
right
to
be
next
to
her
miss
boncassen
herself
bore
her
honours
well
seeming
to
regard
the
little
change
at
table
as
though
it
was
of
no
moment
i
became
so
eager
about
that
game
she
said
that
i
went
on
too
long
i
hope
you
are
now
none
the
worse
at
six
this
morning
i
thought
i
should
never
use
my
legs
again
were
you
awake
at
six
said
silverbridge
with
pitying
voice
that
was
it
i
could
not
sleep
now
i
begin
to
hope
that
sooner
or
later
i
shall
unstiffen
during
every
moment
at
every
word
that
he
uttered
he
was
thinking
of
the
declaration
of
love
which
he
had
made
to
her
but
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
the
matter
had
not
dwelt
on
her
mind
when
they
drew
their
chairs
away
from
the
table
he
thought
that
not
a
moment
was
to
be
lost
before
some
further
explanation
of
their
feelings
for
each
other
should
be
made
was
not
the
matter
which
had
been
so
far
discussed
of
vital
importance
for
both
of
them
and
glorious
as
she
was
above
all
other
women
the
offer
which
he
had
made
must
have
some
weight
with
her
he
did
not
think
that
he
proposed
to
give
more
than
she
deserved
but
still
that
which
he
was
so
willing
to
give
was
not
a
little
or
was
it
possible
that
she
had
not
understood
his
meaning
if
so
he
would
not
willingly
lose
a
moment
before
he
made
it
plain
to
her
but
she
seemed
content
to
hang
about
with
the
other
women
and
when
she
sauntered
about
the
grounds
seated
herself
on
a
with
lady
mabel
and
discussed
with
great
eloquence
the
general
beauty
of
scottish
scenery
an
hour
went
on
in
this
way
could
it
be
that
she
knew
that
he
had
offered
to
make
her
his
wife
during
this
time
he
went
and
returned
more
than
once
but
still
she
was
there
on
the
same
talking
to
those
who
came
in
her
way
then
on
a
sudden
she
got
up
and
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
come
and
take
a
turn
with
me
she
said
lord
silverbridge
do
you
remember
anything
of
last
night
remember
i
thought
for
a
while
this
morning
that
i
would
let
it
pass
as
though
it
had
been
mere
trifling
it
would
have
wanted
two
to
let
it
pass
in
that
way
he
said
almost
indignantly
on
hearing
this
she
looked
up
at
him
and
there
came
over
her
face
that
brilliant
smile
which
to
him
was
perhaps
the
most
potent
of
her
spells
what
do
you
mean
by
wanting
two
i
must
have
a
voice
in
that
as
well
as
you
and
what
is
your
voice
my
voice
is
this
i
told
you
last
night
that
i
loved
you
this
morning
i
ask
you
to
be
my
wife
it
is
a
very
clear
voice
she
said
almost
in
a
whisper
but
in
a
tone
so
serious
that
it
startled
him
it
ought
to
be
clear
he
said
doggedly
do
you
think
i
do
know
that
do
you
think
that
if
i
liked
you
well
last
night
i
do
like
you
better
now
but
do
you
like
me
that
is
just
the
thing
i
am
going
to
say
nothing
about
isabel
just
the
one
thing
i
will
not
allude
to
now
you
must
listen
to
me
certainly
i
know
a
great
deal
about
you
we
americans
are
an
inquiring
people
and
i
have
found
out
pretty
much
everything
his
mind
misgave
him
as
he
felt
she
had
ascertained
his
former
purpose
respecting
mabel
you
she
said
among
young
men
in
england
are
about
the
foremost
and
therefore
as
i
think
about
the
foremost
in
the
world
and
you
have
all
personal
gifts
youth
and
spirits
well
i
will
not
go
on
and
name
the
others
you
are
no
doubt
supposed
to
be
entitled
to
the
best
and
sweetest
of
god
feminine
creatures
you
are
she
whether
you
be
entitled
to
me
or
not
i
can
not
yet
say
now
i
will
tell
you
something
of
myself
my
father
father
came
to
new
york
as
a
labourer
from
holland
and
worked
upon
the
quays
in
that
city
then
he
built
houses
and
became
rich
and
was
almost
a
miser
with
the
good
sense
however
to
educate
his
only
son
what
my
father
is
you
see
to
me
he
is
sterling
gold
but
he
is
not
like
your
people
my
dear
mother
is
not
at
all
like
your
ladies
she
is
not
a
lady
in
your
sense
though
with
her
unselfish
devotion
to
others
she
is
something
infinitely
better
for
myself
i
am
well
meaning
to
speak
honestly
i
will
call
myself
pretty
and
smart
i
think
i
know
how
to
be
true
i
am
sure
you
do
but
what
right
have
you
to
suppose
i
shall
know
how
to
be
a
duchess
i
am
sure
you
will
now
listen
to
me
go
to
your
friends
and
ask
them
ask
that
lady
mabel
ask
your
father
ask
that
lady
cantrip
and
above
all
ask
yourself
and
allow
me
to
require
you
to
take
three
months
to
do
this
do
not
come
to
see
me
for
three
months
and
then
what
may
happen
then
i
can
not
tell
for
i
want
three
months
also
to
think
of
it
myself
till
then
she
gave
him
her
hand
and
left
it
in
his
for
a
few
seconds
he
tried
to
draw
her
to
him
but
she
resisted
him
still
smiling
then
she
left
him
chapter
xli
ischl
it
was
a
custom
with
finn
almost
every
autumn
to
go
off
to
vienna
where
she
possessed
considerable
property
and
there
to
inspect
the
circumstances
of
her
estate
sometimes
her
husband
would
accompany
her
and
he
did
so
in
this
year
of
which
we
are
now
speaking
one
morning
in
september
they
were
together
at
an
hotel
at
ischl
whither
they
had
come
from
vienna
when
as
they
went
through
the
hall
into
the
courtyard
they
came
in
the
very
doorway
upon
the
duke
of
omnium
and
his
daughter
the
duke
and
lady
mary
had
just
arrived
having
passed
through
the
mountains
from
the
district
and
were
about
to
take
up
their
residence
in
the
hotel
for
a
few
days
they
had
travelled
very
slowly
for
lady
mary
had
been
ill
and
the
duke
had
expressed
his
determination
to
see
a
doctor
at
ischl
there
is
no
greater
mistake
than
in
supposing
that
only
the
young
blush
but
the
blushes
of
middle
life
are
luckily
not
seen
through
the
tan
which
has
come
from
the
sun
and
the
gas
and
the
work
and
the
wiles
of
the
world
both
the
duke
and
phineas
blushed
and
though
their
blushes
were
hidden
that
peculiar
glance
of
the
eye
which
always
accompanies
a
blush
was
visible
enough
from
one
to
the
other
the
elder
lady
kept
her
countenance
admirably
and
the
younger
one
had
no
occasion
for
blushing
she
at
once
ran
forward
and
kissed
her
friend
the
duke
stood
with
his
hat
off
waiting
to
give
his
hand
to
the
lady
and
then
took
that
of
his
late
colleague
how
odd
that
we
should
meet
here
he
said
turning
to
finn
odd
enough
to
us
that
your
grace
should
be
here
she
said
because
we
had
heard
nothing
of
your
intended
coming
it
is
so
nice
to
find
you
said
lady
mary
we
are
this
moment
come
do
say
that
you
are
this
moment
going
at
this
moment
we
are
only
going
as
far
as
halstadt
and
are
coming
back
to
dinner
of
course
they
will
dine
with
us
will
they
not
papa
the
duke
said
that
he
hoped
they
would
to
declare
that
you
are
engaged
at
an
hotel
unless
there
be
some
real
engagement
is
almost
an
impossibility
there
was
no
escape
and
before
they
were
allowed
to
get
into
their
carriage
they
had
promised
they
would
dine
with
the
duke
and
his
daughter
i
do
know
that
it
is
especially
a
bore
finn
said
to
her
husband
in
the
carriage
you
may
be
quite
sure
that
of
whatever
trouble
there
may
be
in
it
he
has
much
more
than
his
share
his
share
should
be
the
whole
said
her
husband
no
one
else
has
done
anything
wrong
when
the
duke
apology
had
reached
her
so
that
there
was
no
longer
any
ground
for
absolute
hostility
then
she
had
told
the
whole
story
to
her
husband
he
at
first
was
very
indignant
what
right
had
the
duke
to
expect
that
any
ordinary
friend
should
act
duenna
over
his
daughter
in
accordance
with
his
caprices
this
was
said
and
much
more
of
the
kind
but
any
humour
towards
quarrelling
which
phineas
finn
might
have
felt
for
a
day
or
two
was
quieted
by
his
wife
prudence
a
man
she
said
can
do
no
more
than
apologise
after
that
there
is
no
room
for
reproach
at
dinner
the
conversation
turned
at
first
on
british
politics
in
which
finn
was
quite
able
to
take
her
part
phineas
was
decidedly
of
opinion
that
sir
timothy
beeswax
and
lord
drummond
could
not
live
another
session
and
on
this
subject
a
good
deal
was
said
later
in
the
evening
the
duke
found
himself
sitting
with
finn
in
the
broad
verandah
over
the
hotel
garden
while
lady
mary
was
playing
to
phineas
within
how
do
you
think
she
is
looking
asked
the
father
of
course
i
see
that
she
has
been
she
tells
me
that
she
was
far
from
well
at
salzburg
yes
indeed
for
three
or
four
days
she
frightened
me
much
she
suffered
terribly
from
headaches
nervous
headaches
so
they
said
there
i
feel
quite
angry
with
myself
because
i
did
not
bring
a
doctor
with
us
the
trouble
and
ceremony
of
such
an
accompaniment
is
no
doubt
disagreeable
and
i
suppose
seemed
when
you
started
to
be
unnecessary
quite
unnecessary
does
she
complain
again
now
she
did
a
little
the
next
day
lady
mary
could
not
leave
her
bed
and
the
duke
in
his
sorrow
was
obliged
to
apply
to
finn
after
what
had
passed
on
the
previous
day
finn
of
course
called
and
was
shown
at
once
up
to
her
young
friend
room
there
she
found
the
girl
in
great
pain
lying
with
her
two
thin
hands
up
to
her
head
and
hardly
able
to
utter
more
than
a
word
shortly
after
that
finn
was
alone
with
the
duke
and
then
there
took
place
a
conversation
between
them
which
the
lady
thought
to
be
very
remarkable
had
i
better
send
for
a
doctor
from
england
he
asked
in
answer
to
this
finn
expressed
her
opinion
that
such
a
measure
was
hardly
necessary
that
the
gentleman
from
the
town
who
had
been
called
in
seemed
to
know
what
he
was
about
and
that
the
illness
lamentable
as
it
was
did
not
seem
to
be
in
any
way
dangerous
one
can
not
tell
what
it
comes
from
said
the
duke
dubiously
young
people
i
fancy
are
often
subject
to
such
maladies
it
must
come
from
something
wrong
that
may
be
said
of
all
sickness
and
therefore
one
tries
to
find
out
the
cause
she
says
that
she
is
unhappy
these
last
words
he
spoke
slowly
and
in
a
low
voice
to
this
finn
could
make
no
reply
she
did
not
doubt
but
that
the
girl
was
unhappy
and
she
knew
well
why
but
the
source
of
lady
mary
misery
was
one
to
which
she
could
not
very
well
allude
you
know
all
the
misery
about
that
young
man
that
is
a
trouble
that
requires
time
to
cure
it
she
said
not
meaning
to
imply
that
time
would
cure
it
by
enabling
the
girl
to
forget
her
lover
but
because
in
truth
she
had
not
known
what
else
to
say
if
time
will
cure
it
time
they
say
cures
all
sorrows
but
what
should
i
do
to
help
time
there
is
no
sacrifice
i
would
not
make
no
sacrifice
of
myself
i
mean
i
would
devote
myself
to
her
leave
everything
else
on
one
side
we
purpose
being
back
in
england
in
october
but
i
would
remain
here
if
i
thought
it
better
for
her
comfort
i
can
not
tell
duke
neither
can
i
but
you
are
a
woman
and
might
know
better
than
i
do
it
is
so
hard
that
a
man
should
be
left
with
a
charge
of
which
from
its
very
nature
he
can
not
understand
the
duties
then
he
paused
but
she
could
find
no
words
which
would
suit
at
the
moment
it
was
almost
incredible
to
her
that
after
what
had
passed
he
should
speak
to
her
at
all
as
to
the
condition
of
his
daughter
i
can
not
you
know
he
said
very
seriously
encourage
a
hope
that
she
should
be
allowed
to
marry
that
man
i
do
not
know
you
yourself
finn
felt
that
when
she
told
you
about
it
at
matching
i
felt
that
you
would
disapprove
of
it
disapprove
of
it
how
could
it
be
otherwise
of
course
you
felt
that
there
are
ranks
in
life
in
which
the
first
comer
that
suits
a
maiden
eye
may
be
accepted
as
a
fitting
lover
i
will
not
say
but
that
they
who
are
born
to
such
a
life
may
be
the
happier
they
are
i
am
sure
free
from
troubles
to
which
they
are
incident
whom
fate
has
called
to
a
different
sphere
but
duty
is
duty
and
whatever
pang
it
may
cost
duty
should
be
performed
certainly
certainly
certainly
certainly
he
said
her
word
but
then
duke
one
has
to
be
so
sure
what
duty
requires
in
many
matters
this
is
easy
enough
and
the
only
difficulty
comes
from
temptation
there
are
cases
in
which
it
is
so
hard
to
know
is
this
one
of
them
i
think
so
then
the
maiden
should
in
any
class
of
life
be
allowed
to
take
the
man
that
just
suits
her
eye
as
he
said
this
his
mind
was
intent
on
his
glencora
and
on
burgo
fitzgerald
i
have
not
said
so
a
man
may
be
bad
vicious
a
spendthrift
eaten
up
by
bad
habits
then
he
frowned
thinking
that
she
also
had
her
mind
intent
on
his
glencora
and
on
that
burgo
fitzgerald
and
being
most
unwilling
to
have
the
difference
between
burgo
and
frank
tregear
pointed
out
to
him
nor
have
i
said
she
continued
that
even
were
none
of
these
faults
apparent
in
the
character
of
a
suitor
the
lady
should
in
all
cases
be
advised
to
accept
a
young
man
because
he
has
made
himself
agreeable
to
her
there
may
be
discrepancies
there
are
said
he
still
with
a
low
voice
but
with
infinite
energy
insurmountable
discrepancies
i
only
said
that
this
was
a
case
in
which
it
might
be
difficult
for
you
to
see
your
duty
plainly
why
should
it
be
you
would
not
have
her
break
her
heart
then
he
was
silent
for
awhile
turning
over
in
his
mind
the
proposition
which
now
seemed
to
have
been
made
to
him
if
the
question
came
to
that
should
she
be
allowed
to
break
her
heart
and
die
or
should
he
save
her
from
that
fate
by
sanctioning
her
marriage
with
tregear
if
the
choice
could
be
put
to
him
plainly
by
some
supernal
power
what
then
would
he
choose
if
duty
required
him
to
prevent
this
marriage
his
duty
could
not
be
altered
by
the
fact
that
his
girl
would
avenge
herself
upon
him
by
dying
if
such
a
marriage
were
in
itself
wrong
that
wrong
could
not
be
made
right
by
the
fear
of
such
a
catastrophe
was
it
not
often
the
case
that
duty
required
that
someone
should
die
and
yet
as
he
thought
of
it
thought
that
the
someone
whom
his
mind
had
suggested
was
the
one
female
creature
now
left
belonging
to
him
he
put
his
hand
up
to
his
brow
and
trembled
with
agony
if
he
knew
if
in
truth
he
believed
that
such
would
be
the
result
of
firmness
on
his
part
then
he
would
be
infirm
then
he
must
yield
sooner
than
that
he
must
welcome
this
tregear
to
his
house
but
why
should
he
think
that
she
would
die
this
woman
had
now
asked
him
whether
he
would
be
willing
to
break
his
girl
heart
it
was
a
frightful
question
but
he
could
see
that
it
had
come
naturally
in
the
sequence
of
the
conversation
which
he
had
forced
upon
her
did
girls
break
their
hearts
in
such
emergencies
was
it
not
all
romance
men
have
died
and
worms
have
eaten
them
but
not
for
love
he
remembered
it
all
and
carried
on
the
argument
in
his
mind
though
the
pause
was
but
for
a
minute
there
might
be
suffering
no
doubt
the
higher
the
duties
the
keener
the
pangs
but
would
it
become
him
to
be
deterred
from
doing
right
because
she
for
a
time
might
find
that
she
had
made
the
world
bitter
to
herself
and
were
there
not
feminine
wiles
tricks
by
which
women
learn
to
have
their
way
in
opposition
to
the
judgment
of
their
lords
and
masters
he
did
not
think
that
his
mary
was
wilfully
guilty
of
any
scheme
the
suffering
he
knew
was
true
suffering
but
not
the
less
did
it
become
him
to
be
on
his
guard
against
attacks
of
this
nature
no
he
said
at
last
i
would
not
have
her
break
her
heart
if
i
understand
what
such
words
mean
they
are
generally
i
think
used
fantastically
you
would
not
wish
to
see
her
overwhelmed
by
sorrow
wish
it
what
a
question
to
ask
a
father
i
must
be
more
plain
in
my
language
duke
though
such
a
marriage
be
distasteful
to
you
it
might
perhaps
be
preferable
to
seeing
her
sorrowing
always
why
should
it
i
have
to
sorrow
always
we
are
told
that
man
is
born
to
sorrow
as
surely
as
the
sparks
fly
upwards
then
i
can
say
nothing
further
you
think
i
am
cruel
if
i
am
to
say
what
i
really
think
i
shall
offend
you
no
not
unless
you
mean
offence
i
shall
never
do
that
to
you
duke
when
you
talk
as
you
do
now
you
hardly
know
yourself
you
think
you
could
see
her
suffering
and
not
be
moved
by
it
but
were
it
to
be
continued
long
you
would
give
way
though
we
know
that
there
is
an
infinity
of
grief
in
this
life
still
we
struggle
to
save
those
we
love
from
grieving
if
she
be
steadfast
enough
to
cling
to
her
affection
for
this
man
then
at
last
you
will
have
to
yield
he
looked
at
her
frowning
but
did
not
say
a
word
then
it
will
perhaps
be
a
comfort
for
you
to
know
that
the
man
himself
is
trustworthy
and
honest
there
was
a
terrible
rebuke
in
this
but
still
as
he
had
called
it
down
upon
himself
he
would
not
resent
it
even
in
his
heart
thank
you
he
said
rising
from
his
chair
perhaps
you
will
see
her
again
this
afternoon
of
course
she
assented
and
as
the
interview
had
taken
place
in
his
rooms
she
took
her
leave
this
which
finn
had
said
to
him
was
all
to
the
same
effect
as
that
which
had
come
from
lady
cantrip
only
it
was
said
with
a
higher
spirit
both
the
women
saw
the
matter
in
the
same
light
there
must
be
a
fight
between
him
and
his
girl
but
she
if
she
could
hold
out
for
a
certain
time
would
be
the
conqueror
he
might
take
her
away
and
try
what
absence
would
do
or
he
might
have
recourse
to
that
specific
which
had
answered
so
well
in
reference
to
his
own
wife
but
if
she
continued
to
sorrow
during
absence
and
if
she
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
other
lover
then
he
must
at
last
give
way
he
had
declared
that
he
was
willing
to
sacrifice
himself
meaning
thereby
that
if
a
lengthened
visit
to
the
cities
of
china
or
a
prolonged
sojourn
in
the
western
states
of
america
would
wean
her
from
her
love
he
would
go
to
china
or
to
the
western
states
at
present
his
had
been
carried
no
farther
than
vienna
during
their
travels
hitherto
tregear
name
had
not
once
been
mentioned
the
duke
had
come
away
from
home
resolved
not
to
mention
it
and
she
was
minded
to
keep
it
in
reserve
till
some
seeming
catastrophe
should
justify
a
declaration
of
her
purpose
but
from
first
to
last
she
had
been
sad
and
latterly
she
had
been
ill
when
asked
as
to
her
complaint
she
would
simply
say
that
she
was
not
happy
to
go
on
with
this
through
the
chinese
cities
could
hardly
be
good
for
either
of
them
she
would
not
wake
herself
to
any
enthusiasm
in
regard
to
scenery
costume
pictures
or
even
discomforts
wherever
she
was
taken
it
was
all
barren
to
her
as
their
plans
stood
at
present
they
were
to
return
to
england
so
as
to
enable
her
to
be
at
custins
by
the
middle
of
october
had
he
taught
himself
to
hope
that
any
good
could
be
done
by
prolonged
travelling
he
would
readily
have
thrown
over
custins
and
lord
popplecourt
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
trust
much
to
the
popplecourt
scheme
but
the
same
contrivance
had
answered
on
that
former
occasion
when
he
spoke
to
her
about
their
plans
she
expressed
herself
quite
ready
to
go
back
to
england
when
he
suggested
those
chinese
cities
her
face
became
very
long
and
she
was
immediately
attacked
by
paroxysms
of
headaches
i
think
i
should
take
her
to
some
place
on
the
seashore
in
england
said
finn
custins
is
close
to
the
sea
he
replied
it
is
lord
place
in
dorsetshire
it
was
partly
settled
that
she
was
to
go
there
i
suppose
she
likes
lady
cantrip
why
should
she
not
she
has
not
said
a
word
to
me
to
the
contrary
i
only
fear
she
would
feel
that
she
was
being
sent
there
as
to
a
convent
what
ought
i
to
do
then
how
can
i
venture
to
answer
that
what
she
would
like
best
i
think
would
be
to
return
to
matching
with
you
and
to
settle
down
in
a
quiet
way
for
the
winter
the
duke
shook
his
head
that
would
be
worse
than
travelling
she
would
still
have
headaches
and
still
tell
him
that
she
was
unhappy
of
course
i
do
not
know
what
your
plans
are
and
pray
believe
me
that
i
should
not
obtrude
my
advice
if
you
did
not
ask
me
i
know
it
he
said
i
know
how
good
you
are
and
how
reasonable
i
know
how
much
you
have
to
forgive
oh
no
and
if
i
have
not
said
so
as
i
should
have
done
it
has
not
been
from
want
of
feeling
i
do
believe
you
did
what
you
thought
best
when
mary
told
you
that
story
at
matching
why
should
your
grace
go
back
to
that
only
that
i
may
acknowledge
my
indebtedness
to
you
and
say
to
you
somewhat
fuller
than
i
could
do
in
my
letter
that
i
am
sorry
for
the
pain
which
i
gave
you
all
that
is
over
now
and
shall
be
forgotten
then
he
spoke
of
his
immediate
plans
he
would
at
once
go
back
to
england
by
slow
stages
by
very
slow
stages
staying
a
day
or
two
at
salzburg
at
ratisbon
at
nuremberg
at
frankfort
and
so
on
in
this
way
he
would
reach
england
about
the
of
october
and
mary
would
then
be
ready
to
go
to
custins
by
the
time
appointed
in
a
day
or
two
lady
mary
was
better
it
is
terrible
while
it
lasts
she
said
speaking
to
finn
of
her
headache
but
when
it
has
gone
then
i
am
quite
well
only
she
added
after
a
pause
only
i
can
never
be
happy
again
while
papa
thinks
as
he
does
now
then
there
was
a
party
made
up
before
they
separated
for
an
excursion
to
the
hintersee
and
the
obersee
on
this
occasion
lady
mary
seemed
to
enjoy
herself
as
she
liked
the
companionship
of
finn
against
lady
cantrip
she
never
said
a
word
but
lady
cantrip
was
always
a
duenna
to
her
whereas
finn
was
a
friend
while
the
duke
and
phineas
were
discussing
politics
together
thoroughly
enjoying
the
weakness
of
lord
drummond
and
the
iniquity
of
sir
timothy
which
they
did
with
augmented
vehemence
from
their
ponies
backs
the
two
women
in
lower
voices
talked
over
their
own
affairs
i
dare
say
you
will
be
happy
at
custins
said
finn
no
i
shall
not
there
will
be
people
there
whom
i
do
know
and
i
do
want
to
know
have
you
heard
anything
about
him
mrs
finn
finn
turned
round
and
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
almost
angrily
then
her
heart
relented
do
you
mean
mr
tregear
yes
mr
tregear
i
think
i
heard
that
he
was
shooting
with
lord
silverbridge
i
am
glad
of
that
said
mary
it
will
be
pleasant
for
both
of
them
i
am
very
glad
they
should
be
together
while
i
know
that
i
feel
that
we
are
not
altogether
separated
i
will
never
give
it
up
finn
never
never
it
is
no
use
taking
me
to
china
in
that
finn
quite
agreed
with
her
chapter
xlii
again
at
killancodlem
silverbridge
remained
at
under
the
dominion
of
reginald
dobbes
till
the
second
week
in
september
popplecourt
nidderdale
and
gerald
palliser
were
there
also
very
obedient
and
upon
the
whole
efficient
tregear
was
intractable
occasional
and
untrustworthy
he
was
the
cause
of
much
trouble
to
dobbes
he
would
entertain
a
most
heterodox
and
injurious
idea
that
as
he
had
come
to
for
amusement
he
was
not
bound
to
do
anything
that
did
not
amuse
him
he
would
not
understand
that
in
sport
as
in
other
matters
there
was
an
ambition
driving
a
man
on
to
excel
always
and
be
ahead
of
others
in
spite
of
this
dobbes
had
cause
for
much
triumph
it
was
going
to
be
the
greatest
thing
ever
done
by
six
guns
in
scotland
as
for
gerald
whom
he
had
regarded
as
a
boy
and
who
had
offended
him
by
saying
that
was
ugly
he
was
ready
to
go
round
the
world
for
him
he
had
indoctrinated
gerald
with
all
his
ideas
of
a
sportsman
even
to
a
contempt
for
champagne
and
a
conviction
that
tobacco
should
be
moderated
the
three
lords
too
had
proved
themselves
efficient
and
the
thing
was
going
to
be
a
success
but
just
when
a
day
was
of
vital
importance
when
it
was
essential
that
there
should
be
a
strong
party
for
a
drive
silverbridge
found
it
absolutely
necessary
that
he
should
go
over
to
killancodlem
she
has
gone
said
nidderdale
who
the
is
she
asked
silverbridge
almost
angrily
everybody
knows
who
she
is
said
popplecourt
it
will
be
a
good
thing
when
some
she
has
got
hold
of
you
my
boy
so
as
to
keep
you
in
your
proper
place
if
you
can
not
withstand
that
sort
of
attraction
you
ought
not
to
go
in
for
shooting
at
all
said
dobbes
i
should
wonder
at
his
going
continued
nidderdale
if
we
did
all
know
that
the
american
is
no
longer
there
she
has
gone
to
bath
i
think
they
say
i
suppose
it
jones
herself
said
popplecourt
my
dear
boys
said
silverbridge
you
may
be
quite
sure
that
when
i
say
that
i
am
going
to
killancodlem
i
mean
to
go
to
killancodlem
and
that
no
chaff
about
young
ladies
which
i
think
very
disgusting
will
stop
me
i
shall
be
sorry
if
dobbes
roll
of
the
killed
should
be
lessened
by
a
single
hand
seeing
that
his
ambition
sets
that
way
considering
the
amount
of
slaughter
we
have
perpetrated
i
really
think
that
we
need
not
be
over
anxious
after
this
nothing
further
was
said
tregear
who
knew
that
mabel
grex
was
still
at
killancodlem
had
not
spoken
in
truth
mabel
had
sent
for
lord
silverbridge
and
this
had
been
her
letter
dear
lord
silverbridge
montacute
jones
is
cut
to
the
heart
because
you
have
not
been
over
to
see
her
again
and
she
says
that
it
is
lamentable
to
think
that
such
a
man
as
reginald
dobbes
should
have
so
much
power
over
you
only
twelve
miles
she
says
and
he
knows
that
we
are
here
i
told
her
that
you
knew
miss
boncassen
was
gone
but
though
miss
boncassen
has
left
us
we
are
a
very
pleasant
party
and
surely
you
must
be
tired
of
such
a
place
as
if
only
for
the
sake
of
getting
a
good
dinner
once
in
a
way
do
come
over
again
i
shall
be
here
yet
for
ten
days
as
they
will
not
let
me
go
back
to
grex
i
do
know
where
i
could
be
more
happy
i
have
been
asked
to
go
to
custins
and
suppose
i
shall
turn
up
there
some
time
in
the
autumn
and
now
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
expect
i
do
expect
that
you
will
come
over
to
see
me
i
did
see
her
the
other
day
you
will
say
and
she
did
not
make
herself
pleasant
i
know
that
how
was
i
to
make
myself
pleasant
when
i
found
myself
so
completely
snuffed
out
by
your
american
beauty
now
she
is
away
and
richard
will
be
himself
do
come
because
in
truth
i
want
to
see
you
yours
always
sincerely
mabel
grex
on
receiving
this
he
at
once
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
killancodlem
but
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
why
it
was
that
she
had
asked
him
he
was
sure
of
two
things
sure
in
the
first
place
that
she
had
intended
to
let
him
know
that
she
did
not
care
about
him
and
then
sure
that
she
was
aware
of
his
intention
in
regard
to
miss
boncassen
everybody
at
killancodlem
had
seen
it
to
his
disgust
but
still
that
it
was
so
had
been
manifest
and
he
had
consoled
himself
feeling
that
it
would
matter
nothing
should
he
be
accepted
she
had
made
an
attempt
to
talk
him
out
of
his
purpose
could
it
be
that
she
thought
it
possible
a
second
attempt
might
be
successful
if
so
she
did
not
know
him
she
had
in
truth
thought
not
only
that
this
but
that
something
further
than
this
might
be
possible
of
course
the
prize
loomed
larger
before
her
eyes
as
the
prospects
of
obtaining
it
became
less
she
could
not
doubt
that
he
had
intended
to
offer
her
his
hand
when
he
had
spoken
to
her
of
his
love
in
london
then
she
had
stopped
him
had
spared
him
as
she
had
told
her
friend
certainly
she
had
then
been
swayed
by
some
feeling
that
it
would
be
ungenerous
in
her
to
seize
greedily
the
first
opportunity
he
had
given
her
but
he
had
again
made
an
effort
he
surely
would
not
have
sent
her
the
ring
had
he
not
intended
her
to
regard
him
as
her
lover
when
she
received
the
ring
her
heart
had
beat
very
high
then
she
had
sent
that
little
note
saying
that
she
would
keep
it
till
she
could
give
it
to
his
wife
when
she
wrote
that
she
had
intended
the
ring
should
be
her
own
and
other
things
pressed
upon
her
mind
why
had
she
been
asked
to
the
dinner
at
richmond
why
was
she
invited
to
custins
little
hints
had
reached
her
of
the
duke
goodwill
towards
her
if
on
that
side
the
marriage
were
approved
why
should
she
destroy
her
own
hopes
then
she
had
seen
him
with
miss
boncassen
and
in
her
pique
had
forced
the
ring
back
upon
him
during
that
long
game
on
the
lawn
her
feelings
had
been
very
bitter
of
course
the
girl
was
the
lovelier
of
the
two
all
the
world
was
raving
of
her
beauty
and
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
the
charm
of
her
wit
and
manner
and
then
she
had
no
touch
of
that
blasé
way
of
life
of
which
lady
mabel
was
conscious
herself
it
was
natural
that
it
should
be
so
and
was
she
mabel
grex
the
girl
to
stand
in
his
way
and
to
force
herself
upon
him
if
he
loved
another
certainly
not
though
there
might
be
a
triple
ducal
coronet
to
be
had
but
were
there
not
other
considerations
could
it
be
well
that
the
heir
of
the
house
of
omnium
should
marry
an
american
girl
as
to
whose
humble
birth
whispers
were
already
afloat
as
his
friend
would
it
not
be
right
that
she
should
tell
him
what
the
world
would
say
as
his
friend
therefore
she
had
given
him
her
counsel
when
he
was
gone
the
whole
thing
weighed
heavily
upon
her
mind
why
should
she
lose
the
prize
if
it
might
still
be
her
own
to
be
duchess
of
omnium
she
had
read
of
many
of
the
other
sex
and
of
one
or
two
of
her
own
who
by
settled
resolution
had
achieved
greatness
in
opposition
to
all
obstacles
was
this
thing
beyond
her
reach
to
hunt
him
and
catch
him
and
marry
him
to
his
own
injury
that
would
be
impossible
to
her
she
was
sure
of
herself
there
but
how
infinitely
better
would
this
be
for
him
would
she
not
have
all
his
family
with
her
and
all
the
world
of
england
in
how
short
a
time
would
he
not
repent
his
marriage
with
miss
boncassen
whereas
were
she
his
wife
she
would
so
stir
herself
for
his
joys
for
his
good
for
his
honour
that
there
should
be
no
possibility
of
repentance
and
he
certainly
had
loved
her
why
else
had
he
followed
her
and
spoken
such
words
to
her
of
course
he
had
loved
her
but
then
there
had
come
this
blaze
of
beauty
and
had
carried
off
not
his
heart
but
his
imagination
because
he
had
yielded
to
such
fascination
was
she
to
desert
him
and
also
to
desert
herself
from
day
to
day
she
thought
of
it
and
then
she
wrote
that
letter
she
hardly
knew
what
she
would
do
what
she
might
say
but
she
would
trust
to
the
opportunity
to
do
and
say
something
if
you
have
no
room
for
me
he
said
to
jones
you
must
scold
lady
mab
she
has
told
me
that
you
told
her
to
invite
me
of
course
i
did
do
you
think
i
would
not
sleep
in
the
stables
and
give
you
up
my
own
bed
if
there
were
no
other
it
is
so
good
of
you
to
come
so
good
of
you
jones
to
ask
me
so
very
kind
to
come
when
all
the
attraction
has
gone
then
he
blushed
and
stammered
and
was
just
able
to
say
that
his
only
object
in
life
was
to
pour
out
his
adoration
at
the
feet
of
montacute
jones
herself
there
was
a
certain
lady
fawn
a
pretty
mincing
married
woman
of
about
with
a
husband
much
older
who
liked
mild
flirtations
with
mild
young
men
i
am
afraid
we
lost
your
great
attraction
she
whispered
to
him
certainly
not
as
long
as
lady
fawn
is
here
he
said
seating
himself
close
to
her
on
a
garden
bench
and
seizing
suddenly
hold
of
her
hand
she
gave
a
little
scream
and
a
jerk
and
so
relieved
herself
from
him
you
see
said
he
people
do
make
such
mistakes
about
a
man
feelings
lord
silverbridge
it
quite
true
but
i
tell
you
all
about
it
another
time
and
so
he
left
her
all
these
little
troubles
his
experience
in
the
house
the
necessity
of
snubbing
tifto
the
choice
of
a
wife
and
his
battle
with
reginald
dobbes
were
giving
him
by
degrees
age
and
flavour
lady
mabel
had
fluttered
about
him
on
his
first
coming
and
had
been
very
gracious
doing
the
part
of
an
old
friend
there
is
to
be
a
big
shooting
she
said
in
the
presence
of
jones
if
it
is
to
come
to
that
he
said
i
might
as
well
go
back
to
dobbydom
you
may
shoot
if
you
like
said
lady
mabel
i
have
even
brought
a
gun
with
me
then
we
have
a
walk
a
whole
lot
of
us
she
said
in
the
evening
about
an
hour
before
dinner
silverbridge
and
lady
mabel
were
seated
together
on
the
bank
of
a
little
stream
which
ran
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
but
on
a
spot
not
more
than
a
furlong
from
the
she
had
brought
him
there
but
she
had
done
so
without
any
definite
scheme
she
had
made
no
plan
of
campaign
for
the
evening
having
felt
relieved
when
she
found
herself
able
to
postpone
the
project
of
her
attack
till
the
morrow
of
course
there
must
be
an
attack
but
how
it
should
be
made
she
had
never
had
the
courage
to
tell
herself
the
great
women
of
the
world
the
semiramises
the
pocahontas
the
ida
pfeiffers
and
the
charlotte
cordays
had
never
been
wanting
to
themselves
when
the
moment
for
action
came
now
she
was
pleased
to
have
this
opportunity
added
to
her
this
pleasant
minute
in
which
some
soft
preparatory
word
might
be
spoken
but
the
great
effort
should
be
made
on
the
morrow
is
not
this
nicer
than
shooting
with
mr
dobbes
she
asked
a
great
deal
nicer
of
course
i
am
bound
to
say
so
but
in
truth
i
want
to
find
out
what
you
really
like
men
are
so
different
you
need
not
pay
me
any
compliment
you
know
that
well
enough
i
like
you
better
than
dobbes
if
you
mean
that
even
so
much
is
something
but
i
am
fond
of
shooting
only
a
man
may
have
enough
of
it
too
much
if
he
is
subject
to
dobbes
as
dobbes
likes
them
to
be
gerald
likes
it
did
you
think
it
odd
she
said
after
a
pause
that
i
should
ask
you
to
come
over
again
was
it
odd
he
replied
that
is
as
you
may
take
it
there
is
certainly
no
other
man
in
the
world
to
whom
i
would
have
done
it
not
to
tregear
yes
she
said
yes
to
tregear
could
i
have
been
as
sure
of
a
welcome
for
him
as
i
am
for
you
frank
is
in
all
respects
the
same
as
a
brother
to
me
that
would
not
have
seemed
odd
i
mean
to
myself
and
has
this
been
odd
to
yourself
yes
not
that
anybody
else
has
felt
it
so
only
i
and
perhaps
you
you
felt
it
so
not
especially
i
thought
you
were
a
very
good
fellow
i
have
always
thought
that
except
when
you
made
me
take
back
the
ring
does
that
still
fret
you
no
man
likes
to
take
back
a
thing
it
makes
him
seem
to
have
been
awkward
and
stupid
in
giving
it
it
was
the
value
you
should
have
left
me
to
judge
of
that
if
i
have
offended
you
i
will
beg
your
pardon
give
me
anything
else
anything
but
that
and
i
will
take
it
but
why
not
that
said
he
now
that
you
have
fitted
it
for
a
lady
finger
it
should
go
to
your
wife
no
one
else
should
have
it
upon
this
he
brought
the
ring
once
more
out
of
his
pocket
and
again
offered
it
to
her
no
anything
but
that
that
your
wife
must
have
then
he
put
the
ring
back
again
it
would
have
been
nicer
for
you
had
miss
boncassen
been
here
in
saying
this
she
followed
no
plan
it
came
rather
from
pique
it
was
almost
as
though
she
had
asked
him
whether
miss
boncassen
was
to
have
the
ring
what
makes
you
say
that
but
it
would
yes
it
would
he
replied
stoutly
turning
round
as
he
lay
on
the
ground
and
facing
her
has
it
come
to
that
come
to
what
you
ask
me
a
question
and
i
answer
you
truly
you
can
not
be
happy
without
her
i
did
not
say
so
you
ask
me
whether
i
should
like
to
have
her
here
and
i
say
yes
what
would
you
think
of
me
if
i
said
no
my
being
here
is
not
enough
this
should
not
have
been
said
of
course
but
the
little
speech
came
from
the
exquisite
pain
of
the
moment
she
had
meant
to
have
said
hardly
anything
she
had
intended
to
be
happy
with
him
just
touching
lightly
on
things
which
might
lead
to
that
attack
which
must
be
made
on
the
morrow
but
words
will
often
lead
whither
the
speaker
has
not
intended
so
it
was
now
and
in
the
soreness
of
her
heart
she
spoke
my
being
here
is
not
enough
it
would
be
enough
he
said
jumping
on
his
feet
if
you
understood
all
and
would
be
kind
to
me
i
will
at
any
rate
be
kind
to
you
she
replied
as
she
sat
upon
the
bank
looking
at
the
running
water
i
have
asked
miss
boncassen
to
be
my
wife
and
she
has
accepted
no
not
as
yet
she
is
to
take
three
months
to
think
of
it
of
course
i
love
her
best
of
all
if
you
will
sympathise
with
me
in
that
then
i
will
be
as
happy
with
you
as
the
day
is
long
no
said
she
i
can
not
i
will
not
very
well
there
should
be
no
such
marriage
if
you
have
told
me
in
confidence
of
course
i
have
told
you
in
confidence
it
will
go
no
farther
but
there
can
be
no
sympathy
between
us
it
it
it
is
not
is
not
then
she
burst
into
tears
mabel
no
sir
no
no
what
did
you
mean
but
never
mind
i
have
no
questions
to
ask
not
a
word
to
say
why
should
i
only
this
that
such
a
marriage
will
disgrace
your
family
to
me
it
is
no
more
than
to
anybody
else
but
it
will
disgrace
your
family
how
she
got
back
to
the
house
she
hardly
knew
nor
did
he
that
evening
they
did
not
again
speak
to
each
other
and
on
the
following
morning
there
was
no
walk
to
the
mountains
before
dinner
he
drove
himself
back
to
and
when
he
was
taking
his
leave
she
shook
hands
with
him
with
her
usual
pleasant
smile
chapter
xliii
what
happened
at
doncaster
the
leger
this
year
was
to
be
run
on
the
september
and
while
lord
silverbridge
was
amusing
himself
with
the
deer
at
and
at
killancodlem
with
the
more
easily
pursued
young
ladies
the
indefatigable
major
was
hard
at
work
in
the
stables
this
came
a
little
hard
on
him
there
was
the
to
be
looked
after
which
made
his
presence
at
runnymede
necessary
and
then
that
fellow
silverbridge
would
not
have
the
horses
trained
anywhere
but
at
newmarket
how
was
he
to
be
in
two
places
at
once
yet
he
was
in
two
places
almost
at
once
in
the
morning
at
egham
and
bagshot
and
sitting
on
the
same
evening
at
the
at
newmarket
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
prime
minister
gradually
had
he
and
captain
green
come
to
understand
each
other
and
though
they
did
at
last
understand
each
other
tifto
would
talk
as
though
there
were
no
such
correct
intelligence
when
for
instance
he
would
abuse
lord
silverbridge
for
being
on
such
occasions
the
captain
remark
would
generally
be
short
that
be
blowed
he
would
say
implying
that
that
state
of
things
between
the
two
partners
in
which
such
complaints
might
be
natural
had
now
been
brought
to
an
end
but
on
one
occasion
about
a
week
before
the
race
he
spoke
out
a
little
plainer
what
the
use
of
your
going
on
with
all
that
before
me
it
settled
what
you
got
to
do
i
do
know
that
anything
is
settled
said
the
major
ai
it
i
thought
it
was
if
it
ai
you
find
yourself
in
the
wrong
box
you
as
straight
a
tip
as
a
man
need
wish
for
but
if
you
back
out
you
come
to
grief
your
money
all
on
the
other
way
already
on
the
friday
before
the
race
silverbridge
dined
with
tifto
at
the
beargarden
on
the
next
morning
they
went
down
to
newmarket
to
see
the
horse
get
a
gallop
and
came
back
the
same
evening
during
all
this
time
tifto
was
more
than
ordinarily
pleasant
to
his
patron
the
horse
and
the
certainty
of
the
horse
success
were
the
only
subjects
mooted
it
is
what
i
say
repeated
tifto
but
look
at
the
betting
you
ca
get
five
to
four
against
him
they
tell
me
that
if
you
want
to
do
anything
on
the
sunday
the
pull
will
be
the
other
way
i
stand
to
lose
over
already
said
silverbridge
almost
frightened
by
the
amount
but
how
much
are
you
on
to
win
said
tifto
i
suppose
you
could
sell
your
bets
for
down
i
wish
i
knew
how
to
do
it
said
silverbridge
but
this
was
an
arrangement
which
if
made
just
now
would
not
suit
the
views
they
went
to
newmarket
and
there
they
met
captain
green
tifto
said
the
young
lord
i
wo
have
that
fellow
with
us
when
the
horse
is
galloping
there
is
an
honester
man
or
a
man
who
understands
a
paces
better
in
all
england
said
tifto
i
wo
have
him
standing
alongside
of
me
on
the
heath
said
his
lordship
i
do
know
how
i
to
help
it
if
he
there
i
send
the
horse
in
that
all
then
tifto
found
it
best
to
say
a
few
words
to
captain
green
but
the
captain
also
said
a
few
words
to
himself
d
young
fool
he
do
know
what
he
dropping
into
which
assertion
if
you
lay
aside
the
unnecessary
expletive
was
true
to
the
letter
lord
silverbridge
was
a
young
fool
and
did
not
at
all
know
into
what
a
mess
he
was
being
dropped
by
the
united
experience
perspicuity
and
energy
of
the
man
whose
company
on
the
heath
he
had
declined
the
horse
was
quite
a
picture
to
look
at
pook
the
trainer
assured
his
lordship
that
for
health
and
condition
he
had
never
seen
anything
better
stout
all
over
said
pook
and
not
an
ounce
of
what
you
may
call
flesh
and
bright
just
feel
his
coat
my
lord
that
that
is
not
dressing
nor
yet
macassar
and
then
there
were
various
evidences
produced
of
his
pace
how
he
had
beaten
that
horse
giving
him
two
pounds
how
he
had
been
beaten
by
that
but
only
on
a
mile
course
the
leger
distance
was
just
the
thing
for
prime
minister
how
by
a
lucky
chance
that
marvellous
quick
rat
of
a
thing
that
had
won
the
derby
had
not
been
entered
for
the
autumn
race
how
coalheaver
was
known
to
have
had
bad
feet
he
a
stout
no
doubt
is
the
said
pook
and
why
the
have
stuck
to
him
but
he
be
nowhere
on
wednesday
they
beginning
to
see
it
now
my
lord
i
wish
they
was
so
in
the
course
of
the
day
however
they
met
a
gentleman
who
was
of
a
different
opinion
he
said
loudly
that
he
looked
on
the
heaver
as
the
best
in
england
of
course
as
matters
stood
he
going
to
back
the
heaver
at
even
money
but
he
take
to
thirty
in
hundreds
between
the
two
all
this
ended
in
the
bet
being
accepted
and
duly
booked
by
lord
silverbridge
and
in
this
way
silverbridge
added
two
thousand
four
hundred
pounds
to
his
responsibilities
but
there
was
worse
than
this
coming
on
the
sunday
afternoon
he
went
down
to
doncaster
of
course
in
company
with
the
major
he
was
alive
to
the
necessity
of
ridding
himself
of
the
major
but
it
had
been
acknowledged
that
that
duty
could
not
be
performed
till
after
this
race
had
been
run
as
he
sat
opposite
to
his
friend
on
their
journey
to
doncaster
he
thought
of
this
in
the
train
it
should
be
done
immediately
on
their
return
to
london
after
the
race
but
the
horse
his
prime
minister
was
by
this
time
so
dear
to
him
that
he
intended
if
possible
to
keep
possession
of
the
animal
when
they
reached
doncaster
the
were
all
occupied
with
prime
minister
the
horse
and
pook
had
arrived
that
day
from
newmarket
via
cambridge
and
peterborough
tifto
silverbridge
and
pook
visited
him
together
three
times
that
afternoon
and
evening
and
the
captain
also
visited
the
horse
though
not
in
company
with
lord
silverbridge
to
do
pook
justice
no
one
could
be
more
careful
when
the
captain
came
round
with
the
major
pook
was
there
but
captain
green
did
not
enter
the
box
had
no
wish
to
do
so
was
of
opinion
that
on
such
occasions
no
one
whose
business
did
not
carry
him
there
should
go
near
a
horse
his
only
object
seemed
to
be
to
compliment
pook
as
to
his
care
skill
and
good
fortune
it
was
on
the
tuesday
evening
that
the
chief
mischief
was
done
there
was
a
club
at
which
many
of
the
dined
and
there
lord
silverbridge
spent
his
evening
he
was
the
hero
of
the
hour
and
everybody
flattered
him
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
his
head
was
turned
they
dined
at
eight
and
much
wine
was
drunk
no
one
was
tipsy
but
many
were
elated
and
much
confidence
in
their
favourite
animals
was
imparted
to
men
who
had
been
sufficiently
cautious
before
dinner
then
cigars
and
became
common
and
our
young
friend
was
not
more
abstemious
than
others
large
sums
were
named
and
at
last
in
three
successive
bets
lord
silverbridge
backed
his
horse
for
more
than
forty
thousand
pounds
as
he
was
making
the
second
bet
lupton
came
across
to
him
and
begged
him
to
hold
his
hand
it
will
be
a
nasty
sum
for
you
to
lose
and
winning
it
will
be
nothing
to
you
he
said
silverbridge
took
it
but
said
that
he
knew
what
he
was
about
these
men
will
pay
whispered
lupton
but
you
ca
be
quite
sure
what
they
at
the
young
man
brow
was
covered
with
perspiration
he
was
smoking
quick
and
had
already
smoked
more
than
was
good
for
him
all
right
he
said
i
mind
what
i
about
lupton
could
do
no
more
and
retired
before
the
night
was
over
bets
had
been
booked
to
the
amount
stated
and
the
duke
son
who
had
promised
that
he
would
never
plunge
stood
to
lose
about
seventy
thousand
pounds
upon
the
race
while
this
was
going
on
tifto
sat
not
far
from
his
patron
but
completely
silent
during
the
day
and
early
in
the
evening
a
few
sparks
of
the
glory
which
scintillated
from
the
favourite
horse
flew
in
his
direction
but
he
was
on
this
occasion
unlike
himself
and
though
the
horse
was
to
be
run
in
his
name
had
very
little
to
say
in
the
matter
not
a
boast
came
out
of
his
mouth
during
dinner
or
after
dinner
he
was
so
moody
that
his
partner
who
was
generally
anxious
to
keep
him
quiet
more
than
once
endeavoured
to
encourage
him
but
he
was
unable
to
rouse
himself
it
was
still
within
his
power
to
run
straight
to
be
on
the
square
if
not
with
captain
green
at
any
rate
with
lord
silverbridge
but
to
do
so
he
must
make
a
clean
breast
with
his
lordship
and
confess
the
intended
sin
as
he
heard
all
that
was
being
done
his
conscience
troubled
him
sorely
with
pitch
of
this
sort
he
had
never
soiled
himself
before
he
was
to
have
three
thousand
pounds
from
green
and
then
there
would
be
the
bets
he
himself
had
laid
against
the
horse
by
green
assistance
it
would
be
the
making
of
him
of
what
use
had
been
all
his
square
work
to
him
and
then
silverbridge
had
behaved
so
badly
to
him
but
still
as
he
sat
there
during
the
evening
he
would
have
given
a
hand
to
have
been
free
from
the
attempt
he
had
had
no
conception
before
that
he
could
become
subject
to
such
misery
from
such
a
cause
he
would
make
it
straight
with
silverbridge
this
very
night
but
that
silverbridge
was
ever
lighting
fresh
cigars
and
ever
having
his
glass
refilled
it
was
clear
to
him
that
on
this
night
silverbridge
could
not
be
made
to
understand
anything
about
it
and
the
deed
in
which
he
himself
was
to
be
the
chief
actor
was
to
be
done
very
early
in
the
following
morning
at
last
he
slunk
away
to
bed
on
the
following
morning
the
morning
of
the
day
on
which
the
race
was
to
be
run
the
major
tapped
at
his
patron
door
about
seven
of
course
there
was
no
answer
though
the
knock
was
repeated
when
young
men
overnight
drink
as
much
as
silverbridge
had
done
and
smoke
as
many
cigars
they
are
apt
not
to
hear
knocks
at
their
door
made
at
seven
nor
was
his
lordship
servant
up
so
that
tifto
had
no
means
of
getting
at
him
except
by
personal
invasion
of
the
sanctity
of
his
bedroom
but
there
was
no
time
not
a
minute
to
be
lost
now
within
this
minute
that
was
pressing
on
him
tifto
must
choose
his
course
he
opened
the
door
and
was
standing
at
the
young
man
head
what
the
d
does
this
mean
said
his
lordship
angrily
as
soon
as
his
visitor
had
succeeded
in
waking
him
tifto
muttered
something
about
the
horse
which
silverbridge
failed
to
understand
the
young
man
condition
was
by
no
means
pleasant
his
mouth
was
furred
by
the
fumes
of
tobacco
his
head
was
aching
he
was
heavy
with
sleep
and
this
intrusion
seemed
to
him
to
be
a
final
indignity
offered
to
him
by
the
man
whom
he
now
hated
what
business
have
you
to
come
in
here
he
said
leaning
on
his
elbow
i
do
care
a
straw
for
the
horse
if
you
have
anything
to
say
send
my
servant
get
out
oh
very
well
said
tifto
and
tifto
got
out
it
was
about
an
hour
afterwards
that
tifto
returned
and
on
this
occasion
a
groom
from
the
stables
and
the
young
lord
own
servant
and
two
or
three
other
men
were
with
him
tifto
had
been
made
to
understand
that
the
news
now
to
be
communicated
must
be
communicated
by
himself
whether
his
lordship
were
angry
or
not
indeed
after
what
had
been
done
his
lordship
anger
was
not
of
much
moment
in
his
present
visit
he
was
only
carrying
out
the
pleasant
little
plan
which
had
been
arranged
for
him
by
captain
green
what
the
mischief
is
up
said
silverbridge
rising
in
his
bed
then
tifto
told
his
story
sullenly
doggedly
but
still
in
a
perspicuous
manner
and
with
words
which
admitted
of
no
doubt
but
before
he
told
the
story
he
had
excluded
all
but
himself
and
the
groom
he
and
the
groom
had
taken
the
horse
out
of
the
stable
it
being
the
animal
nature
to
eat
his
corn
better
after
slight
exercise
and
while
doing
so
a
nail
had
been
picked
up
is
it
much
asked
silverbridge
jumping
still
higher
in
his
bed
then
he
was
told
that
it
was
very
much
that
the
iron
had
driven
itself
into
the
horse
frog
and
that
there
was
actually
no
possibility
that
the
horse
should
run
on
that
day
he
ca
walk
my
lord
said
the
groom
in
that
authoritative
voice
which
grooms
use
when
they
desire
to
have
their
own
way
and
to
make
their
masters
understand
that
they
at
any
rate
are
not
to
have
theirs
where
is
pook
asked
silverbridge
but
pook
was
also
still
in
bed
it
was
soon
known
to
lord
silverbridge
as
a
fact
that
in
very
truth
the
horse
could
not
run
then
sick
with
headache
with
a
stomach
suffering
unutterable
things
he
had
as
he
dressed
himself
to
think
of
his
seventy
thousand
pounds
of
course
the
money
would
be
forthcoming
but
how
would
his
father
look
at
him
how
would
it
be
between
him
and
his
father
now
after
such
a
misfortune
how
would
he
be
able
to
break
that
other
matter
to
the
duke
and
say
that
he
had
changed
his
mind
about
his
marriage
that
he
was
going
to
abandon
lady
mabel
grex
and
give
his
hand
and
a
future
duchess
coronet
to
an
american
girl
whose
grandfather
had
been
a
porter
a
nail
in
his
foot
well
he
had
heard
of
such
things
before
he
knew
that
such
accidents
had
happened
what
an
ass
must
he
have
been
to
risk
such
a
sum
on
the
and
safety
of
an
animal
who
might
any
day
pick
up
a
nail
in
his
foot
then
he
thought
of
the
caution
which
lupton
had
given
him
what
good
would
the
money
have
done
him
had
he
won
it
what
more
could
he
have
than
he
now
enjoyed
but
to
lose
such
a
sum
of
money
with
all
his
advantages
of
wealth
he
felt
himself
to
be
as
forlorn
and
wretched
as
though
he
had
nothing
left
in
the
world
before
him
chapter
xliv
how
it
was
done
the
story
was
soon
about
the
town
and
was
the
one
matter
for
discussion
in
all
racing
quarters
about
the
town
it
was
about
england
about
all
europe
it
had
travelled
to
america
and
the
indies
to
australia
and
the
chinese
cities
before
two
hours
were
over
before
the
race
was
run
the
accident
was
discussed
and
something
like
the
truth
surmised
in
cairo
calcutta
melbourne
and
san
francisco
but
at
doncaster
it
was
so
a
matter
that
down
to
the
tradesmen
daughters
and
the
boys
at
the
the
town
was
divided
into
two
parties
one
party
believing
it
to
have
been
a
plant
and
the
other
holding
that
the
cause
had
been
natural
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
the
ring
as
a
rule
belonged
to
the
former
party
the
ring
always
suspects
it
did
not
behove
even
those
who
would
win
by
the
transaction
to
stand
up
for
its
honesty
the
intention
had
been
to
take
the
horse
round
a
portion
of
the
outside
of
the
course
near
to
which
his
stable
stood
a
boy
rode
him
and
the
groom
and
tifto
went
with
him
at
a
certain
spot
on
their
return
tifto
had
exclaimed
that
the
horse
was
going
lame
in
his
off
as
to
this
exclamation
the
boy
and
the
two
men
were
agreed
the
boy
was
then
made
to
dismount
and
run
for
pook
and
as
he
started
tifto
commenced
to
examine
the
horse
foot
the
boy
saw
him
raise
the
off
he
himself
had
not
found
the
horse
lame
under
him
but
had
been
so
hustled
and
hurried
out
of
the
saddle
by
tifto
and
the
groom
that
he
had
not
thought
on
that
matter
till
he
was
questioned
so
far
the
story
told
by
tifto
and
the
groom
was
corroborated
by
the
boy
except
as
to
the
horse
actual
lameness
so
far
the
story
was
believed
by
all
men
except
in
regard
to
the
actual
lameness
and
so
far
it
was
true
then
according
to
tifto
and
the
groom
the
other
foot
was
looked
at
but
nothing
was
seen
this
other
foot
the
near
was
examined
by
the
groom
who
declared
himself
to
be
so
flurried
by
the
lameness
of
such
a
horse
at
such
a
time
that
he
hardly
knew
what
he
saw
or
what
he
did
not
see
at
any
rate
then
in
his
confusion
he
found
no
cause
of
lameness
but
the
horse
was
led
into
the
stable
as
lame
as
a
tree
here
tifto
found
the
nail
inserted
into
the
very
cleft
of
the
frog
of
the
near
and
so
inserted
that
he
could
not
extract
it
till
the
farrier
came
that
the
farrier
had
extracted
the
nail
from
the
part
of
the
foot
indicated
was
certainly
a
fact
then
there
was
the
nail
only
those
who
were
most
peculiarly
privileged
were
allowed
to
see
the
nail
but
it
was
buzzed
about
the
racing
quarters
that
the
head
of
the
nail
an
old
rusty
straight
and
nail
bore
on
it
the
mark
of
a
recent
hammer
in
answer
to
this
it
was
alleged
that
the
blacksmith
in
extracting
the
nail
with
his
pincers
had
of
course
operated
on
its
head
had
removed
certain
particles
of
rust
and
might
easily
have
given
it
the
appearance
of
having
been
struck
but
in
answer
to
this
the
farrier
who
was
a
sharp
fellow
and
quite
beyond
suspicion
in
the
matter
declared
that
he
had
very
particularly
looked
at
the
nail
before
he
extracted
it
had
looked
at
it
with
the
feeling
on
his
mind
that
something
base
might
too
probably
have
been
done
and
that
he
was
ready
to
swear
that
the
clear
mark
on
the
head
of
the
nail
was
there
before
he
touched
it
and
then
not
in
the
stable
but
lying
under
the
little
away
from
the
there
was
found
a
small
piece
of
broken
iron
bar
about
a
foot
long
which
might
have
answered
for
a
hammer
a
rusty
bit
of
iron
and
amidst
the
rust
of
this
was
found
such
traces
as
might
have
been
left
had
it
been
used
in
striking
such
a
nail
there
were
some
who
declared
that
neither
on
the
nail
nor
on
the
iron
could
they
see
anything
and
among
these
was
the
major
but
lupton
brought
a
strong
to
bear
and
the
world
of
examiners
was
satisfied
that
the
marks
were
there
it
seemed
however
to
be
agreed
that
nothing
could
be
done
silverbridge
would
not
lend
himself
at
all
to
those
who
suspected
mischief
he
was
miserable
enough
but
in
this
great
trouble
he
would
not
separate
himself
from
tifto
i
do
believe
a
word
of
all
that
he
said
to
lupton
it
ought
to
be
investigated
at
any
rate
said
lupton
pook
may
do
as
he
likes
but
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
then
tifto
came
to
him
swaggering
tifto
had
to
go
through
a
considerable
amount
of
acting
for
which
he
was
not
very
well
adapted
the
captain
would
have
done
it
better
he
would
have
endeavoured
to
put
himself
altogether
into
the
same
boat
with
his
partner
and
would
have
imagined
neither
suspicion
or
enmity
on
his
partner
part
till
suspicion
or
enmity
had
been
shown
but
tifto
who
had
not
expected
that
the
matter
would
be
allowed
to
pass
over
without
some
inquiry
began
by
assuming
that
silverbridge
would
think
evil
of
him
tifto
who
at
this
moment
would
have
given
all
that
he
had
in
the
world
not
to
have
done
the
deed
who
now
hated
the
instigator
of
the
deed
and
felt
something
almost
akin
to
love
for
silverbridge
found
himself
to
be
forced
by
circumstances
to
defend
himself
by
swaggering
i
do
understand
all
this
that
going
on
my
lord
he
said
neither
do
i
replied
silverbridge
any
horse
is
subject
to
an
accident
i
am
i
suppose
as
great
a
sufferer
as
you
are
and
a
deuced
sight
less
able
to
bear
it
who
has
said
anything
to
the
contrary
as
for
bearing
it
we
must
take
it
as
it
comes
both
of
us
you
may
as
well
know
now
as
later
that
i
have
done
with
racing
for
ever
what
do
you
tell
me
that
for
you
can
do
as
you
like
and
i
can
do
as
i
like
about
that
if
i
had
had
my
way
about
the
horse
this
never
would
have
happened
taking
a
horse
out
at
that
time
in
the
morning
before
a
race
why
you
went
with
him
yourself
yes
by
pook
orders
you
allowed
pook
to
do
just
as
he
pleased
i
should
like
to
know
what
money
pook
has
got
on
it
and
which
way
he
laid
it
this
disgusted
silverbridge
so
much
that
he
turned
away
and
would
have
no
more
to
say
to
tifto
before
one
at
which
hour
it
was
stated
nominally
that
the
races
would
commence
general
opinion
had
formed
itself
and
general
opinion
had
nearly
hit
the
truth
general
opinion
declared
that
the
nail
had
been
driven
in
wilfully
that
it
had
been
done
by
tifto
himself
and
that
tifto
had
been
instigated
by
captain
green
captain
green
perhaps
his
part
a
little
his
intimacy
with
the
major
was
well
known
and
yet
in
all
this
turmoil
he
kept
himself
apart
as
though
he
had
no
interest
in
the
matter
i
have
got
my
little
money
on
and
what
little
i
have
i
lose
he
said
in
answer
to
inquiries
but
everyone
knew
that
he
could
not
but
have
a
great
interest
in
a
race
as
to
which
the
half
owner
of
the
favourite
was
a
peculiarly
intimate
friend
of
his
own
had
he
come
down
to
the
stables
and
been
seen
about
the
place
with
tifto
it
might
have
been
better
as
it
was
though
he
was
very
quiet
his
name
was
soon
mixed
up
in
the
matter
there
was
one
man
who
asserted
it
as
a
fact
known
to
himself
that
green
and
villiers
one
gilbert
villiers
were
in
partnership
together
it
was
very
well
known
that
gilbert
villiers
would
win
two
thousand
five
hundred
pounds
from
lord
silverbridge
then
minute
investigation
was
made
into
the
betting
of
certain
individuals
of
course
there
would
be
great
plunder
and
where
would
the
plunder
go
who
would
get
the
money
which
poor
silverbridge
would
lose
it
was
said
that
one
at
least
of
the
large
bets
made
on
that
tuesday
evening
could
be
traced
to
the
same
villiers
though
not
actually
made
by
him
more
would
be
learned
when
the
should
come
but
there
was
quite
enough
already
to
show
that
there
were
many
men
determined
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
all
if
possible
there
came
upon
silverbridge
in
his
trouble
a
keen
sense
of
his
position
and
a
feeling
of
the
dignity
which
he
ought
to
support
he
clung
during
great
part
of
the
morning
to
lupton
lupton
was
much
his
senior
and
they
had
never
been
intimate
but
now
there
was
comfort
in
his
society
i
am
afraid
you
are
hit
heavily
said
lupton
something
over
seventy
thousand
pounds
looking
at
what
will
be
your
property
it
is
of
course
nothing
but
if
if
what
if
you
go
to
the
jews
for
it
then
it
will
become
a
great
deal
i
shall
certainly
not
do
that
then
you
may
regard
it
as
a
trifle
said
lupton
no
i
ca
it
is
not
a
trifle
i
must
tell
my
father
he
find
the
money
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
he
will
but
i
feel
at
present
that
i
would
rather
change
places
with
the
poorest
gentleman
i
know
than
have
to
tell
him
i
have
done
with
races
lupton
if
so
this
will
have
been
a
happy
day
for
you
a
man
in
your
position
can
hardly
make
money
by
it
but
he
may
lose
so
much
if
a
man
really
likes
the
amusement
as
i
do
and
risks
no
more
than
what
he
has
in
his
pocket
that
may
be
very
well
at
any
rate
i
have
done
with
it
nevertheless
he
went
to
see
the
race
run
and
everybody
seemed
to
be
touched
with
pity
for
him
he
carried
himself
well
saying
as
little
as
he
could
of
his
own
horse
and
taking
or
affecting
to
take
great
interest
in
the
race
after
the
race
he
managed
to
see
all
those
to
whom
he
had
lost
heavy
stakes
having
to
own
to
himself
as
he
did
so
that
not
one
of
them
was
a
gentleman
to
whom
he
should
like
to
give
his
hand
to
them
he
explained
that
his
father
was
abroad
that
probably
his
liabilities
could
not
be
settled
till
after
his
return
he
however
would
consult
his
father
agent
and
would
then
appear
on
they
were
all
full
of
the
blandest
courtesies
there
was
not
one
of
them
who
had
any
doubt
as
to
getting
his
money
unless
the
whole
thing
might
be
disputed
on
the
score
of
tifto
villany
even
then
payment
could
not
be
disputed
unless
it
was
proved
that
he
who
demanded
the
money
had
been
one
of
the
actual
conspirators
after
having
seen
his
creditors
he
went
away
up
alone
to
london
when
in
london
he
went
to
carlton
terrace
and
spent
the
night
in
absolute
solitude
it
had
been
his
plan
to
join
gerald
for
some
at
matching
and
then
to
go
yachting
till
such
time
as
he
should
be
enabled
to
renew
his
suit
to
miss
boncassen
early
in
november
he
would
again
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
these
had
been
his
plans
but
now
it
seemed
that
everything
was
changed
and
yachting
must
be
out
of
the
question
till
this
terrible
load
was
taken
off
his
shoulders
soon
after
his
arrival
at
the
house
two
telegrams
followed
him
from
doncaster
one
was
from
gerald
what
is
all
this
about
prime
minister
is
it
a
sell
i
am
so
unhappy
the
other
was
from
lady
mabel
for
among
other
luxuries
montacute
jones
had
her
own
at
killancodlem
can
this
be
true
we
are
all
so
miserable
i
do
hope
it
is
not
much
from
which
he
learned
that
his
misfortune
was
already
known
to
all
his
friends
and
now
what
was
he
to
do
he
ate
his
supper
and
then
without
hesitating
for
a
moment
feeling
that
if
he
did
hesitate
the
task
would
not
be
done
on
that
night
he
sat
down
and
wrote
the
following
letter
carlton
terrace
my
dear
moreton
i
have
just
come
up
from
doncaster
you
have
probably
heard
what
has
been
prime
minister
fate
i
do
know
whether
any
horse
has
ever
been
such
a
favourite
for
the
leger
early
in
the
morning
he
was
taken
out
and
picked
up
a
nail
the
consequence
was
he
could
not
run
now
i
must
come
to
the
bad
part
of
my
story
i
have
lost
seventy
thousand
pounds
it
is
no
use
beating
about
the
bush
the
sum
is
something
over
that
what
am
i
to
do
if
i
tell
you
that
i
shall
give
up
racing
altogether
i
dare
say
you
will
not
believe
me
it
is
a
sort
of
thing
a
man
always
says
when
he
wants
money
but
i
feel
now
i
can
not
help
saying
it
but
what
shall
i
do
perhaps
if
it
be
not
too
much
trouble
you
will
come
up
to
town
and
see
me
you
can
send
me
a
word
by
the
wires
you
may
be
sure
of
this
i
shall
make
no
attempt
to
raise
the
money
elsewhere
unless
i
find
that
my
father
will
not
help
me
you
will
understand
that
of
course
it
must
be
paid
you
will
understand
also
what
i
must
feel
about
telling
my
father
but
i
shall
do
so
at
once
i
only
wait
till
i
can
hear
from
you
yours
faithfully
silverbridge
during
the
next
day
two
despatches
reached
lord
silverbridge
both
of
them
coming
as
he
sat
down
to
his
solitary
dinner
the
first
consisted
of
a
short
but
very
civil
note
messrs
comfort
and
criball
present
their
compliments
to
the
earl
of
silverbridge
and
beg
to
offer
their
apologies
for
interfering
but
desire
to
inform
his
lordship
that
should
cash
be
wanting
to
any
amount
in
consequence
of
the
late
races
they
will
be
happy
to
accommodate
his
lordship
on
most
reasonable
terms
at
a
moment
notice
upon
his
lordship
single
bond
lord
silverbridge
may
be
sure
of
absolute
secrecy
crasham
court
crutched
friars
the
other
despatch
was
a
telegram
from
moreton
saying
that
he
would
be
in
carlton
terrace
by
noon
on
the
following
day
chapter
xlv
there
shall
not
be
another
word
about
it
early
in
october
the
duke
was
at
matching
with
his
daughter
and
phineas
finn
and
his
wife
were
both
with
them
on
the
day
after
they
parted
at
ischl
the
first
news
respecting
prime
minister
had
reached
him
namely
that
his
son
horse
had
lost
the
race
this
would
not
have
annoyed
him
at
all
but
that
the
papers
which
he
read
contained
some
vague
charge
of
swindling
against
somebody
and
hinted
that
lord
silverbridge
had
been
a
victim
even
this
would
not
have
troubled
him
might
in
some
sort
have
comforted
him
were
it
not
made
evident
to
him
that
his
son
had
been
closely
associated
with
swindlers
in
these
transactions
if
it
were
a
mere
question
of
money
that
might
be
settled
without
difficulty
even
though
the
sum
lost
might
have
grown
out
of
what
he
might
have
expected
into
some
few
thousands
still
he
would
bear
it
without
a
word
if
only
he
could
separate
his
boy
from
bad
companions
then
came
moreton
letter
telling
the
whole
at
the
meeting
which
took
place
between
silverbridge
and
his
agent
at
carlton
terrace
it
was
settled
that
moreton
should
write
the
letter
silverbridge
tried
and
found
that
he
could
not
do
it
he
did
not
know
how
to
humiliate
himself
sufficiently
and
yet
could
not
keep
himself
from
making
attempts
to
prove
that
according
to
all
recognised
chances
his
bets
had
been
good
bets
moreton
was
better
able
to
accomplish
the
task
he
knew
the
duke
mind
a
very
large
discretion
had
been
left
in
hands
in
regard
to
moneys
which
might
be
needed
on
behalf
of
that
dangerous
heir
so
large
that
he
had
been
able
to
tell
lord
silverbridge
that
if
the
money
was
in
truth
lost
according
to
jockey
club
rules
it
should
all
be
forthcoming
on
the
certainly
without
assistance
from
messrs
comfort
and
criball
the
duke
had
been
nervously
afraid
of
such
men
of
business
as
comfort
and
criball
and
from
the
earliest
days
of
his
had
been
on
his
guard
against
them
let
any
sacrifice
be
made
so
that
his
son
might
be
kept
clear
from
comforts
and
criballs
to
moreton
he
had
been
very
explicit
his
own
pecuniary
resources
were
so
great
that
they
could
bear
some
ravaging
without
serious
detriment
it
was
for
his
son
character
and
standing
in
the
world
for
his
future
respectability
and
dignity
that
his
fears
were
so
keen
and
not
for
his
own
money
by
one
so
excitable
so
fond
of
pleasure
as
lord
silverbridge
some
ravaging
would
probably
be
made
let
it
be
met
by
ready
money
such
had
been
the
duke
instructions
to
his
own
trusted
man
of
business
and
acting
on
these
instructions
moreton
was
able
to
tell
the
heir
that
the
money
should
be
forthcoming
moreton
after
detailing
the
extent
and
the
nature
of
the
loss
and
the
steps
which
he
had
decided
upon
taking
went
on
to
explain
the
circumstances
as
best
he
could
he
had
made
some
inquiry
and
felt
no
doubt
that
a
gigantic
swindle
had
been
perpetrated
by
major
tifto
and
others
the
swindle
had
been
successful
moreton
had
consulted
certain
gentlemen
of
high
character
versed
in
affairs
of
the
turf
he
mentioned
lupton
among
others
and
had
been
assured
that
though
the
swindle
was
undoubted
the
money
had
better
be
paid
it
was
thought
to
be
impossible
to
connect
the
men
who
had
made
the
bets
with
the
perpetrators
of
the
fraud
and
if
lord
silverbridge
were
to
abstain
from
paying
his
bets
because
his
own
partner
had
ruined
the
animal
which
belonged
to
them
jointly
the
feeling
would
be
against
him
rather
than
in
his
favour
in
fact
the
jockey
club
could
not
sustain
him
in
such
refusal
therefore
the
money
would
be
paid
moreton
with
some
expressions
of
doubt
trusted
that
he
might
be
thought
to
have
exercised
a
wise
discretion
then
he
went
on
to
express
his
own
opinion
in
regard
to
the
lasting
effect
which
the
matter
would
have
upon
the
young
man
i
think
said
he
that
his
lordship
is
heartily
sickened
of
racing
and
that
he
will
never
return
to
it
the
duke
was
of
course
very
wretched
when
these
tidings
first
reached
him
though
he
was
a
rich
man
and
of
all
men
the
least
careful
of
his
riches
still
he
felt
that
seventy
thousand
pounds
was
a
large
sum
of
money
to
throw
away
among
a
nest
of
swindlers
and
then
it
was
excessively
grievous
to
him
that
his
son
should
have
been
mixed
up
with
such
men
wishing
to
screen
his
son
even
from
his
own
anger
he
was
careful
to
remember
that
the
promise
made
that
tifto
should
be
dismissed
was
not
to
take
effect
till
after
this
race
had
been
run
there
had
been
no
deceit
in
that
but
then
silverbridge
had
promised
that
he
would
not
plunge
there
are
however
promises
which
from
their
very
nature
may
be
broken
without
falsehood
plunging
is
a
doubtful
word
and
the
path
down
to
it
like
all
doubtful
paths
is
slippery
and
easy
if
that
assurance
with
which
moreton
ended
his
letter
could
only
be
made
true
he
could
bring
himself
to
forgive
even
this
offence
the
boy
must
be
made
to
settle
himself
in
life
the
duke
resolved
that
his
only
revenge
should
be
to
press
on
that
marriage
with
mabel
grex
at
coblenz
on
their
way
home
the
duke
and
his
daughter
were
caught
up
by
and
finn
and
the
matter
of
the
young
man
losses
was
discussed
phineas
had
heard
all
about
it
and
was
loud
in
denunciations
against
tifto
captain
green
gilbert
villiers
and
others
whose
names
had
reached
him
the
money
he
thought
should
never
have
been
paid
the
duke
however
declared
that
the
money
would
not
cause
a
moment
regret
if
only
the
whole
thing
could
be
got
rid
of
at
that
cost
it
had
reached
finn
ears
that
tifto
was
already
at
loggerheads
with
his
associates
there
was
some
hope
that
the
whole
thing
might
be
brought
to
light
by
this
means
for
all
that
the
duke
cared
nothing
if
only
silverbridge
and
tifto
could
for
the
future
be
kept
apart
as
far
as
he
and
his
were
concerned
good
would
have
been
done
rather
than
harm
while
they
were
in
this
way
together
on
the
rhine
it
was
decided
that
very
soon
after
their
return
to
england
phineas
and
finn
should
go
down
to
matching
when
the
duke
arrived
in
london
his
sons
were
not
there
gerald
had
gone
back
to
oxford
and
silverbridge
had
merely
left
an
address
then
his
sister
wrote
him
a
very
short
letter
papa
will
be
so
glad
if
you
will
come
to
matching
do
come
of
course
he
came
and
presented
himself
some
few
days
after
the
duke
arrival
but
he
dreaded
this
meeting
with
his
father
which
however
let
it
be
postponed
for
ever
so
long
must
come
at
last
in
reference
to
this
he
made
a
great
resolution
that
he
would
go
instantly
as
soon
as
he
might
be
sent
for
when
the
summons
came
he
started
but
though
he
was
by
courtesy
an
earl
and
by
fact
was
not
only
a
man
but
a
member
of
parliament
though
he
was
half
engaged
to
marry
one
young
lady
and
ought
to
have
been
engaged
to
marry
another
though
he
had
come
to
an
age
at
which
pitt
was
a
great
minister
and
pope
a
great
poet
still
his
heart
was
in
his
boots
as
a
schoolboy
might
be
when
he
was
driven
up
to
the
house
at
matching
in
two
minutes
before
he
had
washed
the
dust
from
his
face
and
hands
he
was
with
his
father
i
am
glad
to
see
you
silverbridge
said
the
duke
putting
out
his
hand
i
hope
i
see
you
well
sir
fairly
well
thank
you
travelling
i
think
agrees
with
me
i
miss
not
my
comforts
but
a
certain
knowledge
of
how
things
are
going
on
which
comes
to
us
i
think
through
our
skins
when
we
are
at
home
a
feeling
of
absence
pervades
me
otherwise
i
like
it
and
you
what
have
you
been
doing
shooting
a
little
said
silverbridge
in
a
mooncalf
tone
shooting
a
great
deal
if
what
i
see
in
the
newspapers
be
true
about
reginald
dobbes
and
his
party
i
presume
it
is
a
religion
to
offer
up
hecatombs
to
the
autumnal
gods
who
must
surely
take
a
keener
delight
in
blood
and
slaughter
than
those
bloodthirsty
gods
of
old
you
should
talk
to
gerald
about
that
sir
has
gerald
been
so
great
at
his
sacrifices
how
will
that
suit
with
plato
what
does
simcox
say
of
course
they
were
all
to
have
a
holiday
just
at
that
time
but
gerald
is
reading
i
fancy
that
gerald
is
clever
and
he
is
a
great
nimrod
as
to
hunting
nimrod
i
fancy
got
his
game
in
any
way
that
he
could
compass
it
i
do
not
doubt
but
that
he
trapped
foxes
with
a
rifle
at
deer
say
for
four
hundred
yards
i
would
back
gerald
against
any
man
of
his
age
in
england
or
scotland
as
for
backing
silverbridge
do
not
you
think
that
we
had
better
have
done
with
that
this
was
said
hardly
in
a
tone
of
reproach
with
something
even
of
banter
in
it
and
as
the
question
was
asked
the
duke
was
smiling
but
in
a
moment
all
that
sense
of
joyousness
which
the
young
man
had
felt
in
singing
his
brother
praises
was
expelled
his
face
fell
and
he
stood
before
his
father
almost
like
a
culprit
we
might
as
well
have
it
out
about
this
racing
continued
the
duke
something
has
to
be
said
about
it
you
have
lost
an
enormous
sum
of
money
the
duke
tone
in
saying
this
became
terribly
severe
such
at
least
was
its
sound
in
his
son
ears
he
did
not
mean
to
be
severe
but
when
he
did
speak
of
that
which
displeased
him
his
voice
naturally
assumed
that
tone
of
indignation
with
which
in
days
of
yore
he
had
been
wont
to
denounce
the
public
extravagance
of
his
opponents
in
the
house
of
commons
the
father
paused
but
the
son
could
not
speak
at
the
moment
and
worse
than
that
continued
the
duke
you
have
lost
it
in
as
bad
company
as
you
could
have
found
had
you
picked
all
england
through
lupton
and
sir
henry
playfair
and
lord
stirling
were
in
the
room
when
the
bets
were
made
were
the
gentlemen
you
name
concerned
with
major
tifto
no
sir
who
can
tell
with
whom
he
may
be
in
a
room
though
rooms
of
that
kind
are
i
think
best
avoided
then
the
duke
paused
again
but
silverbridge
was
now
sobbing
so
that
he
could
hardly
speak
i
am
sorry
that
you
should
be
so
grieved
continued
the
father
but
such
delights
can
not
i
think
lead
to
much
real
joy
it
is
for
you
sir
said
the
son
rubbing
his
eyes
with
the
hand
which
supported
his
head
my
grief
in
the
matter
might
soon
be
cured
how
shall
i
cure
it
i
will
do
anything
to
cure
it
let
major
tifto
and
the
horses
go
they
are
gone
said
silverbridge
energetically
jumping
from
his
chair
as
he
spoke
i
will
never
own
a
horse
again
or
a
part
of
a
horse
i
will
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
races
you
will
believe
me
i
will
believe
anything
that
you
tell
me
i
wo
say
i
will
not
go
to
another
race
because
no
no
i
would
not
have
you
hamper
yourself
nor
shall
you
bind
yourself
by
any
further
promises
you
have
done
with
racing
indeed
indeed
i
have
sir
then
the
father
came
up
to
the
son
and
put
his
arms
round
the
young
man
shoulders
and
embraced
him
of
course
it
made
me
unhappy
i
knew
it
would
but
if
you
are
cured
of
this
evil
the
money
is
nothing
what
is
it
all
for
but
for
you
and
your
brother
and
sister
it
was
a
large
sum
but
that
shall
not
grieve
me
the
thing
itself
is
so
dangerous
that
if
with
that
much
of
loss
we
can
escape
i
will
think
that
we
have
made
not
a
bad
market
who
owns
the
horse
now
the
horses
shall
be
sold
for
anything
they
may
fetch
so
that
we
may
get
clear
of
this
dirt
and
the
major
i
know
nothing
of
him
i
have
not
seen
him
since
that
day
has
he
claims
on
you
not
a
shilling
it
is
all
the
other
way
let
it
go
then
be
quit
of
him
however
it
may
be
send
a
messenger
so
that
he
may
understand
that
you
have
abandoned
racing
altogether
moreton
might
perhaps
see
him
that
his
father
should
forgive
so
readily
and
yet
himself
suffer
so
deeply
affected
the
son
feelings
so
strongly
that
for
a
time
he
could
hardly
repress
his
sobs
and
now
there
shall
not
be
a
word
more
said
about
it
said
the
duke
suddenly
silverbridge
in
his
confusion
could
make
no
answer
there
shall
not
be
another
word
said
about
it
said
the
duke
again
and
now
what
do
you
mean
to
do
with
yourself
immediately
i
stay
here
sir
as
long
as
you
do
finn
and
warburton
and
i
have
still
a
few
coverts
to
shoot
that
a
good
reason
for
staying
anywhere
i
meant
that
i
would
remain
while
you
remained
sir
that
at
any
rate
is
a
good
reason
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
but
we
go
to
custins
next
week
there
a
deal
of
shooting
to
be
done
at
gatherum
said
the
heir
you
speak
of
it
as
if
it
were
the
business
of
your
life
on
which
your
bread
depended
one
ca
expect
game
to
be
kept
up
if
nobody
goes
to
shoot
it
ca
one
i
did
know
i
should
have
thought
that
the
less
was
shot
the
more
there
would
be
to
shoot
but
i
am
ignorant
in
such
matters
silverbridge
then
broke
forth
into
a
long
explanation
as
to
coverts
gamekeepers
poachers
breeding
and
the
expectations
of
the
neighbourhood
at
large
in
the
middle
of
which
he
was
interrupted
by
the
duke
i
am
afraid
my
dear
boy
that
i
am
too
old
to
learn
but
as
it
is
so
manifestly
a
duty
go
and
perform
it
like
a
man
who
will
go
with
you
i
will
ask
finn
to
be
one
he
will
be
very
hard
upon
you
in
the
way
of
politics
i
can
answer
him
better
than
i
can
you
sir
lupton
said
he
would
come
for
a
day
or
two
he
stand
to
me
after
that
his
father
stopped
him
as
he
was
about
to
leave
the
room
one
more
word
silverbridge
do
you
remember
what
you
were
saying
when
you
walked
down
to
the
house
with
me
from
your
club
that
night
silverbridge
remembered
very
well
what
he
had
said
he
had
undertaken
to
ask
mabel
grex
to
be
his
wife
and
had
received
his
father
ready
approval
to
the
proposition
but
at
this
moment
he
was
unwilling
to
refer
to
that
matter
i
have
thought
about
it
very
much
since
that
said
the
duke
i
may
say
that
i
have
been
thinking
of
it
every
day
if
there
were
anything
to
tell
me
you
would
let
me
know
would
you
not
yes
sir
then
there
is
nothing
to
be
told
i
hope
you
have
not
changed
your
mind
silverbridge
paused
a
moment
trusting
that
he
might
be
able
to
escape
the
making
of
any
answer
but
the
duke
evidently
intended
to
have
an
answer
it
appeared
to
me
sir
that
it
did
not
seem
to
suit
her
said
the
young
man
he
could
not
now
say
that
mabel
had
shown
a
disposition
to
reject
his
offer
because
as
they
had
been
sitting
by
the
brookside
at
killancodlem
even
he
with
all
his
had
been
forced
to
see
what
were
her
wishes
her
confusion
and
too
evident
despair
when
she
heard
of
the
offer
to
the
american
girl
had
plainly
told
her
tale
he
could
not
now
plead
to
his
father
that
mabel
grex
would
refuse
his
offer
but
his
when
first
he
found
that
he
had
lost
himself
in
love
for
the
american
had
been
based
on
that
idea
he
had
done
his
best
to
make
mabel
understand
him
if
he
had
not
actually
offered
to
her
he
had
done
the
next
thing
to
it
and
he
had
run
after
her
till
he
was
ashamed
of
such
running
she
had
given
him
no
encouragement
and
therefore
he
had
been
justified
no
doubt
he
must
have
been
mistaken
that
he
now
perceived
but
still
he
felt
himself
to
be
justified
it
was
impossible
that
he
should
explain
all
this
to
his
father
one
thing
he
certainly
could
not
say
just
at
present
after
his
folly
in
regard
to
those
heavy
debts
he
could
not
at
once
risk
his
renewed
anger
by
proposing
to
him
an
american
that
must
stand
over
at
any
rate
till
the
girl
had
accepted
him
positively
i
am
afraid
it
wo
come
off
sir
he
said
at
last
then
i
am
to
presume
that
you
have
changed
your
mind
i
told
you
when
we
were
speaking
of
it
that
i
was
not
confident
she
has
not
i
ca
explain
it
all
sir
but
i
fear
it
wo
come
off
then
the
duke
who
had
been
sitting
got
up
from
his
chair
and
with
his
back
to
the
fire
made
a
final
little
speech
we
decided
just
now
silverbridge
that
nothing
more
should
be
said
about
that
unpleasant
racing
business
and
nothing
more
shall
be
said
by
me
but
you
must
not
be
surprised
if
i
am
anxious
to
see
you
settled
in
life
no
young
man
could
be
more
bound
by
duty
to
marry
early
than
you
are
in
the
first
place
you
have
to
repair
the
injury
done
by
my
inaptitude
for
society
you
have
explained
to
me
that
it
is
your
duty
to
have
the
barsetshire
coverts
properly
shot
and
i
have
acceded
to
your
views
surely
it
must
be
equally
your
duty
to
see
your
barsetshire
neighbours
and
you
are
a
young
man
every
feature
of
whose
character
would
be
improved
by
matrimony
as
far
as
means
are
concerned
you
are
almost
as
free
to
make
arrangements
as
though
you
were
already
the
head
of
the
family
no
sir
i
could
never
bring
myself
to
dictate
to
a
son
in
regard
to
his
choice
of
a
wife
but
i
will
own
that
when
you
told
me
that
you
had
chosen
i
was
much
gratified
try
and
think
again
when
you
are
pausing
amidst
your
sacrifices
at
gatherum
whether
that
be
possible
if
it
be
not
still
i
would
wish
you
to
bear
in
mind
what
is
my
idea
as
to
your
duty
silverbridge
said
that
he
would
bear
this
in
mind
and
then
escaped
from
the
room
chapter
xlvi
lady
mary
dream
when
the
duke
and
his
daughter
reached
custins
they
found
a
large
party
assembled
and
were
somewhat
surprised
at
the
crowd
lord
and
lady
nidderdale
were
there
which
might
have
been
expected
as
they
were
part
of
the
family
with
lord
popplecourt
had
come
his
recent
friend
adolphus
longstaff
that
too
might
have
been
natural
and
miss
boncassen
were
there
also
who
at
this
moment
were
quite
strangers
to
the
duke
and
lupton
the
duke
also
found
lady
chiltern
whose
had
more
than
once
sat
in
the
same
cabinet
with
himself
and
monk
who
was
generally
spoken
of
as
the
head
of
the
coming
liberal
government
and
the
ladies
adelaide
and
flora
fitzhoward
the
still
unmarried
but
not
very
juvenile
daughters
of
the
duke
of
bungay
these
with
a
few
others
made
a
large
party
and
rather
confused
the
duke
who
had
hardly
reflected
that
discreet
and
profitable
was
more
likely
to
go
on
among
numbers
than
if
the
two
young
people
were
thrown
together
with
no
other
companions
lord
popplecourt
had
been
made
to
understand
what
was
expected
of
him
and
after
some
hesitation
had
submitted
himself
to
the
conspiracy
there
would
not
be
less
at
any
rate
than
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
and
the
connexion
would
be
made
with
one
of
the
highest
families
in
great
britain
though
lady
cantrip
had
said
very
few
words
those
words
had
been
expressive
and
the
young
bachelor
peer
had
given
in
his
adhesion
some
vague
tale
had
been
told
him
not
about
tregear
as
tregear
name
had
not
been
mentioned
but
respecting
some
dream
of
a
young
man
who
had
flitted
across
the
girl
path
during
her
mother
lifetime
all
girls
have
such
dreams
lady
cantrip
had
suggested
whereupon
lord
popplecourt
said
that
he
supposed
it
was
so
but
a
softer
purer
more
unsullied
flower
never
waited
on
its
stalk
till
the
proper
fingers
should
come
to
pluck
it
said
lady
cantrip
rising
to
unaccustomed
poetry
on
behalf
of
her
friend
the
duke
lord
popplecourt
accepted
the
poetry
and
was
ready
to
do
his
best
to
pluck
the
flower
soon
after
the
duke
arrival
lord
popplecourt
found
himself
in
one
of
the
with
lady
cantrip
and
his
proposed
a
hint
had
been
given
him
that
he
might
as
well
be
home
early
from
shooting
so
as
to
be
in
the
way
as
the
hour
in
which
he
was
to
make
himself
specially
agreeable
both
to
the
father
and
to
the
daughter
had
drawn
nigh
he
became
somewhat
nervous
and
now
at
this
moment
was
not
altogether
comfortable
though
he
had
been
concerned
in
no
such
matter
before
he
had
an
idea
that
love
was
a
soft
kind
of
thing
which
ought
to
steal
on
one
unawares
and
come
and
go
without
trouble
in
his
case
it
came
upon
him
with
a
rough
demand
for
immediate
hard
work
he
had
not
previously
thought
that
he
was
to
be
subjected
to
such
labours
and
at
this
moment
almost
resented
the
interference
with
his
ease
he
was
already
a
little
angry
with
lady
cantrip
but
at
the
same
time
felt
himself
to
be
so
much
in
subjection
to
her
that
he
could
not
rebel
the
duke
himself
when
he
saw
the
young
man
was
hardly
more
comfortable
he
had
brought
his
daughter
to
custins
feeling
that
it
was
his
duty
to
be
with
her
but
he
would
have
preferred
to
leave
the
whole
operation
to
the
care
of
lady
cantrip
he
hardly
liked
to
look
at
the
fish
whom
he
wished
to
catch
for
his
daughter
whenever
this
aspect
of
affairs
presented
itself
to
him
he
would
endeavour
to
console
himself
by
remembering
the
past
success
of
a
similar
transaction
he
thought
of
his
own
first
interview
with
his
wife
you
have
heard
he
had
said
what
our
friends
wish
she
had
pouted
her
lips
and
when
gently
pressed
had
at
last
muttered
with
her
shoulder
turned
to
him
that
she
supposed
it
was
to
be
so
very
much
more
coercion
had
been
used
to
her
then
than
either
himself
or
lady
cantrip
had
dared
to
apply
to
his
daughter
he
did
not
think
that
his
girl
in
her
present
condition
of
mind
would
signify
to
lord
popplecourt
that
she
supposed
it
was
to
be
so
now
that
the
time
for
the
transaction
was
present
he
felt
almost
sure
it
would
never
be
transacted
but
still
he
must
go
on
with
it
were
he
now
to
abandon
his
scheme
would
it
not
be
tantamount
to
abandoning
everything
so
he
wreathed
his
face
in
smiles
or
made
some
attempt
at
it
as
he
greeted
the
young
man
i
hope
you
and
lady
mary
had
a
pleasant
journey
abroad
said
lord
popplecourt
lord
popplecourt
being
aware
that
he
had
been
chosen
as
a
felt
himself
called
upon
to
be
familiar
as
well
as
pleasant
i
often
thought
of
you
and
lady
mary
and
wondered
what
you
were
about
we
were
visiting
lakes
and
mountains
churches
and
picture
galleries
cities
and
said
the
duke
does
lady
mary
like
that
sort
of
thing
i
think
she
was
pleased
with
what
she
saw
she
has
been
abroad
a
great
deal
before
i
believe
it
depends
so
much
on
whom
you
meet
when
abroad
this
was
unfortunate
because
it
recalled
tregear
to
the
duke
mind
we
saw
very
few
people
whom
we
knew
he
said
i
been
shooting
in
scotland
with
silverbridge
and
gerald
and
reginald
dobbes
and
nidderdale
and
that
fellow
tregear
who
is
so
thick
with
silverbridge
indeed
i
told
that
lord
gerald
is
going
to
be
the
great
shot
of
his
day
said
lady
cantrip
it
is
a
distinction
said
the
duke
bitterly
he
did
not
beat
me
by
so
much
continued
popplecourt
i
think
tregear
did
the
best
with
his
rifle
one
morning
he
potted
three
dobbes
was
disgusted
he
hated
tregear
is
it
stupid
men
getting
together
in
that
way
asked
lady
cantrip
nidderdale
is
always
jolly
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
said
the
and
gerald
is
a
regular
brick
the
duke
bowed
silverbridge
used
always
to
be
going
off
to
killancodlem
where
there
were
a
lot
of
ladies
he
is
very
sweet
you
know
on
this
american
girl
whom
you
have
here
again
the
duke
winced
dobbes
is
awfully
good
as
to
making
out
the
shooting
but
then
he
is
a
tyrant
nevertheless
i
agree
with
him
if
you
mean
to
do
a
thing
you
should
do
it
certainly
said
the
duke
but
you
should
make
up
your
mind
first
whether
the
thing
is
worth
doing
just
so
said
popplecourt
and
as
grouse
and
deer
together
are
about
the
best
things
out
most
of
us
made
up
our
minds
that
it
was
worth
doing
but
that
fellow
tregear
would
argue
it
out
he
said
a
gentleman
ought
to
play
billiards
as
well
as
a
marker
i
think
he
was
right
said
the
duke
do
you
know
tregear
duke
i
have
met
him
with
my
son
do
you
like
him
i
have
seen
very
little
of
him
i
can
not
say
i
do
he
thinks
so
much
of
himself
of
course
he
is
very
intimate
with
silverbridge
and
that
is
all
that
any
one
knows
of
him
the
duke
bowed
almost
haughtily
though
why
he
bowed
he
could
hardly
have
explained
to
himself
lady
cantrip
bit
her
lips
in
disgust
he
just
the
fellow
continued
popplecourt
to
think
that
some
princess
has
fallen
in
love
with
him
then
the
duke
left
the
room
you
had
better
not
talk
to
him
about
tregear
said
lady
cantrip
why
not
i
do
know
whether
he
approves
of
the
intimacy
between
him
and
lord
silverbridge
i
should
think
not
a
man
without
any
position
or
a
shilling
in
the
world
the
duke
is
peculiar
if
a
subject
is
distasteful
to
him
he
does
not
like
it
to
be
mentioned
you
had
better
not
mention
mr
tregear
lady
cantrip
as
she
said
this
blushed
inwardly
at
her
own
hypocrisy
it
was
of
course
contrived
at
dinner
that
lord
popplecourt
should
take
out
lady
mary
it
is
impossible
to
discover
how
such
things
get
wind
but
there
was
already
an
idea
prevalent
at
custins
that
lord
popplecourt
had
matrimonial
views
and
that
these
views
were
looked
upon
favourably
you
may
be
quite
sure
of
it
lupton
lady
adelaide
fitzhoward
had
said
i
make
a
bet
they
married
before
this
time
next
year
it
will
be
a
terrible
case
of
beauty
and
the
beast
said
lupton
lady
chiltern
had
whispered
a
suspicion
of
the
same
kind
and
had
expressed
a
hope
that
the
lover
would
be
worthy
of
the
girl
and
dolly
longstaff
had
chaffed
his
friend
popplecourt
on
the
subject
popplecourt
having
laid
himself
open
by
indiscreet
allusions
to
dolly
love
for
miss
boncassen
everybody
ca
have
it
as
easily
arranged
for
him
as
you
a
duke
daughter
and
a
pot
of
money
without
so
much
as
the
trouble
of
asking
for
it
what
do
you
know
about
the
duke
children
that
what
it
is
to
be
a
lord
and
not
to
have
a
father
popplecourt
tried
to
show
that
he
was
disgusted
but
he
felt
himself
all
the
more
strongly
bound
to
go
on
with
his
project
it
was
therefore
a
matter
of
course
that
these
lovers
would
be
sent
out
of
the
room
together
you
give
your
arm
to
mary
lady
cantrip
said
dropping
the
ceremonial
prefix
lady
mary
of
course
went
out
as
she
was
bidden
though
everybody
else
knew
it
no
idea
of
what
was
intended
had
yet
come
across
her
mind
the
lover
immediately
reverted
to
the
austrian
tour
expressing
a
hope
that
his
neighbour
had
enjoyed
herself
nothing
i
like
so
much
myself
said
he
remembering
some
of
the
duke
words
as
mountains
cities
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
there
such
a
lot
of
interest
about
it
did
you
ever
see
a
well
not
exactly
a
but
i
have
on
my
property
in
staffordshire
i
very
fond
of
coal
i
hope
you
like
coal
i
like
salt
a
great
deal
better
to
look
at
but
which
do
you
think
pays
best
i
do
mind
telling
you
though
it
a
kind
of
thing
i
never
talk
about
to
strangers
the
royalties
from
the
blogownie
and
toodlem
mines
go
up
regularly
two
thousand
pounds
every
year
i
thought
we
were
talking
about
what
was
pretty
to
look
at
so
we
were
i
as
fond
of
pretty
things
as
anybody
do
you
know
reginald
dobbes
no
i
do
is
he
pretty
he
used
to
be
so
angry
with
silverbridge
because
silverbridge
would
say
was
ugly
was
ugly
just
a
plain
house
on
a
moor
that
sounds
ugly
i
suppose
your
family
like
pretty
things
i
hope
so
i
do
i
know
lord
popplecourt
endeavoured
to
look
as
though
he
intended
her
to
understand
that
she
was
the
pretty
thing
which
he
most
particularly
liked
she
partly
conceived
his
meaning
and
was
disgusted
accordingly
on
the
other
side
of
her
sat
boncassen
to
whom
she
had
been
introduced
in
the
and
who
had
said
a
few
words
to
her
about
some
norwegian
poet
she
turned
round
to
him
and
asked
him
some
questions
about
the
skald
and
so
getting
into
conversation
with
him
managed
to
turn
her
shoulder
to
her
suitor
on
the
other
side
of
him
sat
lady
rosina
de
courcy
to
whom
as
being
an
old
woman
and
an
old
maid
he
felt
very
little
inclined
to
be
courteous
she
said
a
word
asking
him
whether
he
did
not
think
the
weather
was
treacherous
he
answered
her
very
curtly
and
sat
bolt
upright
looking
forward
on
the
table
and
taking
his
dinner
as
it
came
to
him
he
had
been
put
there
in
order
that
lady
mary
palliser
might
talk
to
him
and
he
regarded
interference
on
the
part
of
that
old
american
as
being
ungentlemanlike
but
the
old
american
disregarded
him
and
went
on
with
his
quotations
from
the
scandinavian
bard
but
boncassen
sat
next
to
lady
cantrip
and
when
at
last
he
was
called
upon
to
give
his
ear
to
the
countess
lady
mary
was
again
vacant
for
popplecourt
attentions
are
you
very
fond
of
poetry
he
asked
very
fond
so
am
i
which
do
you
like
best
tennyson
or
shakespeare
they
are
very
unlike
yes
they
are
unlike
or
moore
melodies
i
am
very
fond
of
in
death
i
shall
calm
recline
i
think
this
equal
to
anything
reginald
dobbes
would
have
it
that
poetry
is
all
bosh
then
i
think
that
reginald
dobbes
must
be
all
bosh
himself
there
was
a
man
there
named
tregear
who
had
brought
some
books
then
there
was
a
pause
lady
mary
had
not
a
word
to
say
dobbes
used
to
declare
that
he
was
always
pretending
to
read
poetry
tregear
never
pretends
anything
do
you
know
him
asked
the
rival
he
is
my
brother
most
particular
friend
ah
yes
i
dare
say
silverbridge
has
talked
to
you
about
him
i
think
he
a
sort
of
fellow
to
this
there
was
not
a
word
of
reply
where
did
your
brother
pick
him
up
they
were
at
oxford
together
i
must
say
i
think
he
gives
himself
airs
because
you
know
nobody
i
do
know
anything
of
the
kind
said
lady
mary
becoming
very
red
and
as
he
is
my
brother
most
particular
friend
his
very
friend
of
friends
i
think
you
had
better
not
abuse
him
to
me
i
do
think
the
duke
is
very
fond
of
him
i
do
care
who
is
fond
of
him
i
am
very
fond
of
silverbridge
and
i
wo
hear
his
friend
of
i
dare
say
he
had
some
books
with
him
he
is
not
at
all
the
sort
of
a
man
to
go
to
a
place
and
satisfy
himself
with
doing
nothing
but
killing
animals
do
you
know
him
lady
mary
i
have
seen
him
and
of
course
i
have
heard
a
great
deal
of
him
from
silverbridge
i
would
rather
not
talk
any
more
about
him
you
seem
to
be
very
fond
of
tregear
he
said
angrily
it
is
no
business
of
yours
lord
popplecourt
whether
i
am
fond
of
anybody
or
not
i
have
told
you
that
tregear
is
my
friend
and
that
ought
to
be
enough
lord
popplecourt
was
a
young
man
possessed
of
a
certain
amount
of
ingenuity
it
was
said
of
him
that
he
knew
on
which
side
his
bread
was
buttered
and
that
if
you
wished
to
take
him
in
you
must
get
up
early
after
dinner
and
during
the
night
he
pondered
a
good
deal
on
what
he
had
heard
lady
cantrip
had
told
him
there
had
been
a
dream
what
was
he
to
believe
about
that
dream
had
he
not
better
avoid
the
error
of
putting
too
fine
a
point
upon
it
and
tell
himself
at
once
that
a
dream
in
this
instance
meant
a
lover
lady
mary
had
already
been
troubled
by
a
lover
he
was
disposed
to
believe
that
young
ladies
often
do
have
objectionable
lovers
and
that
things
get
themselves
right
afterwards
young
ladies
can
be
made
to
understand
the
beauty
of
almost
as
readily
as
young
gentlemen
there
would
be
the
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
and
there
was
the
girl
beautiful
and
thoroughly
but
what
if
this
tregear
and
the
dream
were
one
and
the
same
if
so
had
he
not
received
plenty
of
evidence
that
the
dream
had
not
yet
passed
away
a
remnant
of
affection
for
the
dream
would
not
have
been
a
fatal
barrier
had
not
the
girl
been
so
fierce
with
him
in
defence
of
her
dream
he
remembered
too
what
the
duke
had
said
about
tregear
and
lady
cantrip
advice
to
him
to
be
silent
in
respect
to
this
man
and
then
do
girls
generally
defend
their
brothers
friends
as
she
had
defended
tregear
he
thought
not
putting
all
these
things
together
on
the
following
morning
he
came
to
an
uncomfortable
belief
that
tregear
was
the
dream
soon
after
that
he
found
himself
near
to
dolly
longstaff
as
they
were
shooting
you
know
that
fellow
tregear
do
you
oh
lord
yes
he
is
silverbridge
pal
did
you
ever
hear
anything
about
him
what
sort
of
thing
was
he
ever
ever
in
love
with
any
one
i
fancy
he
used
to
be
awfully
spooney
on
mab
grex
i
remember
hearing
that
they
were
to
have
been
married
only
that
neither
of
them
had
sixpence
oh
lady
mabel
grex
that
a
horse
of
another
colour
and
which
is
the
horse
of
your
colour
i
have
got
a
horse
said
lord
popplecourt
going
away
to
his
own
corner
chapter
xlvii
miss
boncassen
idea
of
heaven
it
was
generally
known
that
dolly
longstaff
had
been
heavily
smitten
by
the
charms
of
miss
boncassen
but
the
world
hardly
gave
him
credit
for
the
earnestness
of
his
affection
dolly
had
never
been
known
to
be
in
earnest
in
anything
but
now
he
was
in
very
truth
in
love
he
had
agreed
to
be
popplecourt
companion
at
custins
because
he
had
heard
that
miss
boncassen
would
be
there
he
had
thought
over
the
matter
with
more
consideration
than
he
had
ever
before
given
to
any
subject
he
had
gone
so
far
as
to
see
his
own
man
of
business
with
a
view
of
ascertaining
what
settlements
he
could
make
and
what
income
he
might
be
able
to
spend
he
had
told
himself
over
and
over
again
that
he
was
not
the
sort
of
fellow
that
ought
to
marry
but
it
was
all
of
no
avail
he
confessed
to
himself
that
he
was
completely
bowled
over
knocked
off
his
pins
is
a
fellow
to
have
no
chance
he
said
to
miss
boncassen
at
custins
if
i
understand
what
a
fellow
means
i
am
afraid
not
no
man
alive
was
ever
more
in
earnest
than
i
am
well
longstaff
i
do
not
suppose
that
you
have
been
trying
to
take
me
in
all
this
time
i
hope
you
do
not
think
ill
of
me
i
may
think
well
of
a
great
many
gentlemen
without
wishing
to
marry
them
but
does
love
go
for
nothing
said
dolly
putting
his
hand
upon
his
heart
perhaps
there
are
so
many
that
love
you
not
above
or
so
you
can
make
a
joke
of
it
when
i
but
i
do
think
miss
boncassen
you
at
all
realise
what
i
feel
as
to
settlements
and
all
that
your
father
could
do
what
he
likes
with
me
my
father
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
i
do
know
what
settlements
mean
we
never
think
anything
of
settlements
in
our
country
if
two
young
people
love
each
other
they
go
and
get
married
let
us
do
the
same
here
but
the
two
young
people
do
love
each
other
look
here
longstaff
it
my
opinion
that
a
young
woman
ought
not
to
be
pestered
pestered
you
force
me
to
speak
in
that
way
i
given
you
an
answer
ever
so
many
times
i
will
not
be
made
to
do
it
over
and
over
again
it
that
d
fellow
silverbridge
he
exclaimed
almost
angrily
on
hearing
this
miss
boncassen
left
the
room
without
speaking
another
word
and
dolly
longstaff
found
himself
alone
he
saw
what
he
had
done
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
after
that
he
could
hardly
venture
to
persevere
again
here
at
custins
he
weighed
it
over
in
his
mind
for
a
long
time
almost
coming
to
a
resolution
in
favour
of
hard
drink
he
had
never
felt
anything
like
this
before
he
was
so
uncomfortable
that
he
could
eat
his
luncheon
though
in
accordance
with
his
usual
habit
he
had
breakfasted
off
and
a
morsel
of
devilled
toast
he
did
not
know
himself
in
his
changed
character
i
wonder
whether
she
understands
that
i
have
four
thousand
pounds
a
year
of
my
own
and
shall
have
twelve
thousand
pounds
more
when
my
governor
goes
she
was
so
headstrong
that
it
was
impossible
to
explain
anything
to
her
i
off
to
london
he
said
to
popplecourt
that
afternoon
nonsense
you
said
you
stay
for
ten
days
all
the
same
i
going
at
once
i
sent
to
bridport
for
a
trap
and
i
shall
sleep
at
dorchester
what
the
meaning
of
it
all
i
had
some
words
with
somebody
do
mind
asking
any
more
not
with
the
duke
the
duke
no
i
have
spoken
to
him
or
lord
cantrip
i
wish
you
would
ask
questions
if
you
quarrelled
with
anybody
you
ought
to
consult
a
friend
it
nothing
of
that
kind
then
it
a
lady
it
the
american
girl
do
i
tell
you
i
do
want
to
talk
about
it
i
going
i
told
lady
cantrip
that
my
mother
was
well
and
wants
to
see
me
stop
your
time
out
i
suppose
i
do
know
you
got
it
all
square
no
doubt
i
wish
i
a
handle
to
my
name
i
never
cared
for
it
before
i
sorry
you
so
down
in
the
mouth
why
do
you
try
again
the
thing
is
to
stick
to
like
wax
if
ten
times
of
asking
wo
do
go
in
twenty
times
dolly
shook
his
head
despondently
what
can
you
do
when
a
girl
walks
out
of
the
room
and
slams
the
door
in
your
face
she
get
it
hot
and
heavy
before
she
has
done
i
know
what
she
after
she
might
as
well
cry
for
the
moon
and
so
dolly
got
into
the
trap
and
went
to
bridport
and
slept
that
night
at
the
hotel
at
dorchester
lord
popplecourt
though
he
could
give
such
excellent
advice
to
his
friend
had
been
able
as
yet
to
do
very
little
in
his
own
case
he
had
been
a
week
at
custins
and
had
said
not
a
word
to
denote
his
passion
day
after
day
he
had
prepared
himself
for
the
encounter
but
the
lady
had
never
given
him
the
opportunity
when
he
sat
next
to
her
at
dinner
she
would
be
very
silent
if
he
stayed
at
home
on
a
morning
she
was
not
visible
during
the
short
evenings
he
could
never
get
her
attention
and
he
made
no
progress
with
the
duke
the
duke
had
been
very
courteous
to
him
at
richmond
but
here
he
was
monosyllabic
and
almost
sullen
once
or
twice
lord
popplecourt
had
a
little
conversation
with
lady
cantrip
dear
girl
said
her
ladyship
she
is
so
little
given
to
seeking
admiration
i
dare
say
girls
are
so
different
lord
popplecourt
with
some
of
them
it
seems
that
a
gentleman
need
have
no
trouble
in
explaining
what
it
is
that
he
wishes
i
do
think
lady
mary
is
like
that
at
all
not
in
the
least
any
one
who
addresses
her
must
be
prepared
to
explain
himself
fully
nor
ought
he
to
hope
to
get
much
encouragement
at
first
i
do
not
think
that
lady
mary
will
bestow
her
heart
till
she
is
sure
she
can
give
it
with
safety
there
was
an
amount
of
falsehood
in
this
which
was
proof
at
any
rate
of
very
strong
friendship
on
the
part
of
lady
cantrip
after
a
few
days
lady
mary
became
more
intimate
with
the
american
and
his
daughter
than
with
any
others
of
the
party
perhaps
she
liked
to
talk
about
the
scandinavian
poets
of
whom
boncassen
was
so
fond
perhaps
she
felt
sure
that
her
transatlantic
friend
would
not
make
love
to
her
perhaps
it
was
that
she
yielded
to
the
various
allurements
of
miss
boncassen
miss
boncassen
saw
the
duke
of
omnium
for
the
first
time
at
custins
and
there
had
the
first
opportunity
of
asking
herself
how
such
a
man
as
that
would
receive
from
his
son
and
heir
such
an
announcement
as
lord
silverbridge
would
have
to
make
him
should
she
at
the
end
of
three
months
accept
his
offer
she
was
quite
aware
that
lord
silverbridge
need
not
repeat
the
offer
unless
he
were
so
pleased
but
she
thought
that
he
would
come
again
he
had
so
spoken
that
she
was
sure
of
his
love
and
had
so
spoken
as
to
obtain
hers
yes
she
was
sure
that
she
loved
him
she
had
never
seen
anything
like
him
before
so
glorious
in
his
beauty
so
gentle
in
his
manhood
so
powerful
and
yet
so
little
imperious
so
great
in
condition
and
yet
so
little
confident
in
his
own
greatness
so
bolstered
up
with
external
advantages
and
so
little
apt
to
trust
anything
but
his
own
heart
and
his
own
voice
in
asking
for
her
love
he
had
put
forward
no
claim
but
his
own
love
she
was
glad
he
was
what
he
was
she
counted
at
their
full
value
all
his
natural
advantages
to
be
an
english
duchess
oh
yes
her
ambition
understood
it
all
but
she
loved
him
because
in
the
expression
of
his
love
no
hint
had
fallen
from
him
of
the
greatness
of
the
benefits
which
he
could
confer
upon
her
yes
she
would
like
to
be
a
duchess
but
not
to
be
a
duchess
would
she
become
the
wife
of
a
man
who
should
begin
his
courtship
by
assuming
a
superiority
now
the
chances
of
society
had
brought
her
into
the
company
of
his
nearest
friends
she
was
in
the
house
with
his
father
and
with
his
sister
now
and
again
the
duke
spoke
a
few
words
to
her
and
always
did
so
with
a
peculiar
courtesy
but
she
was
sure
that
the
duke
had
heard
nothing
of
his
son
courtship
and
she
was
equally
sure
that
the
matter
had
not
reached
lady
mary
ears
she
perceived
that
the
duke
and
her
father
would
often
converse
together
boncassen
would
discuss
republicanism
generally
and
the
duke
would
explain
that
theory
of
monarchy
as
it
prevails
in
england
which
but
very
few
americans
have
ever
been
made
to
understand
all
this
miss
boncassen
watched
with
pleasure
she
was
still
of
opinion
that
it
would
not
become
her
to
force
her
way
into
a
family
which
would
endeavour
to
repudiate
her
she
would
not
become
this
young
man
wife
if
all
connected
with
the
young
man
were
resolved
to
reject
the
contact
but
if
she
could
conquer
them
then
then
she
thought
that
she
could
put
her
little
hand
into
that
young
man
grasp
with
a
happy
heart
it
was
in
this
frame
of
mind
that
she
laid
herself
out
not
unsuccessfully
to
win
the
esteem
of
lady
mary
palliser
i
do
not
know
whether
you
approve
it
lady
cantrip
said
to
the
duke
but
mary
has
become
very
intimate
with
our
new
american
friend
at
this
time
lady
cantrip
had
become
very
nervous
so
as
almost
to
wish
that
lady
mary
difficulties
might
be
unravelled
elsewhere
than
at
custins
they
seem
to
be
sensible
people
said
the
duke
i
do
know
when
i
have
met
a
man
with
higher
ideas
on
politics
than
mr
boncassen
his
daughter
is
popular
with
everybody
a
nice
ladylike
girl
said
the
duke
and
appears
to
have
been
well
educated
it
was
now
near
the
end
of
october
and
the
weather
was
peculiarly
fine
perhaps
in
our
climate
october
would
of
all
months
be
the
most
delightful
if
something
of
its
charms
were
not
detracted
from
by
the
feeling
that
with
it
will
depart
the
last
relics
of
the
delights
of
summer
the
leaves
are
still
there
with
their
gorgeous
colouring
but
they
are
going
the
last
rose
still
lingers
on
the
bush
but
it
is
the
last
the
woodland
walks
are
still
pleasant
to
the
feet
but
caution
is
heard
on
every
side
as
to
the
coming
winter
the
park
at
custins
which
was
spacious
had
many
woodland
walks
attached
to
it
from
which
through
vistas
of
the
timber
distant
glimpses
of
the
sea
were
caught
within
half
a
mile
of
the
house
the
woods
were
reached
and
within
a
mile
the
open
sea
was
in
sight
and
yet
the
wanderers
might
walk
for
miles
without
going
over
the
same
ground
here
without
other
companions
lady
mary
and
miss
boncassen
found
themselves
one
afternoon
and
here
the
latter
told
her
story
to
her
lover
sister
i
so
long
to
tell
you
something
she
said
is
it
a
secret
asked
lady
mary
well
yes
it
is
if
you
will
keep
it
so
i
would
rather
you
should
keep
it
a
secret
but
i
will
tell
you
then
she
stood
still
looking
into
the
other
face
i
wonder
how
you
will
take
it
what
can
it
be
your
brother
has
asked
me
to
be
his
wife
silverbridge
yes
lord
silverbridge
you
are
astonished
lady
mary
was
very
much
astonished
so
much
astonished
that
words
escaped
from
her
which
she
regretted
afterwards
i
thought
there
was
someone
else
who
else
lady
mabel
grex
but
i
know
nothing
i
think
not
said
miss
boncassen
slowly
i
have
seen
them
together
and
i
think
not
there
might
be
somebody
though
i
think
not
her
but
why
do
i
say
that
why
do
i
malign
him
and
make
so
little
of
myself
there
is
no
one
else
lady
mary
is
he
not
true
i
think
he
is
true
i
am
sure
he
is
true
and
he
has
asked
me
to
be
his
wife
what
did
you
say
well
what
do
you
think
what
is
it
probable
that
such
a
girl
as
i
would
say
when
such
a
man
as
your
brother
asks
her
to
be
his
wife
is
he
not
such
a
man
as
a
girl
would
love
oh
yes
is
he
not
handsome
as
a
god
mary
stared
at
her
with
all
her
eyes
and
sweeter
than
any
god
those
pagan
races
knew
and
is
he
not
and
loving
and
has
he
not
that
perfection
of
manly
dash
without
which
i
do
not
think
i
could
give
my
heart
to
any
man
then
you
have
accepted
him
and
his
rank
and
his
wealth
the
highest
position
in
all
the
world
in
my
eyes
i
do
not
think
you
should
take
him
for
that
does
it
not
all
help
can
you
put
yourself
in
my
place
why
should
i
refuse
him
no
not
for
that
i
would
not
take
him
for
that
but
if
i
love
him
because
he
is
all
that
my
imagination
tells
me
that
a
man
ought
to
be
if
to
be
his
wife
seems
to
me
to
be
the
greatest
bliss
that
could
happen
to
a
woman
if
i
feel
that
i
could
die
to
serve
him
that
i
could
live
to
worship
him
that
his
touch
would
be
sweet
to
me
his
voice
music
his
strength
the
only
support
in
the
world
on
which
i
would
care
to
lean
what
then
is
it
so
yes
it
is
so
it
is
after
that
fashion
that
i
love
him
he
is
my
hero
and
not
the
less
so
because
there
is
none
higher
than
he
among
the
nobles
of
the
greatest
land
under
the
sun
would
you
have
me
for
a
sister
lady
mary
could
not
answer
all
at
once
she
had
to
think
of
her
father
and
then
she
thought
of
her
own
lover
why
should
not
silverbridge
be
as
well
entitled
to
his
choice
as
she
considered
herself
to
be
and
yet
how
would
it
be
with
her
father
silverbridge
would
in
process
of
time
be
the
head
of
the
family
would
it
be
proper
that
he
should
marry
an
american
you
would
not
like
me
for
a
sister
i
was
thinking
of
my
father
for
myself
i
like
you
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
said
to
him
if
you
will
i
told
him
that
he
must
ask
his
friends
that
i
would
not
be
his
wife
to
be
rejected
by
them
all
nor
will
i
though
it
be
heaven
i
will
not
creep
there
through
a
hole
if
i
can
not
go
in
with
my
head
upright
i
will
not
go
even
there
then
she
turned
round
as
though
she
were
prepared
in
her
emotion
to
walk
back
to
the
house
alone
but
lady
mary
ran
after
her
and
having
caught
her
put
her
arm
round
her
waist
and
kissed
her
i
at
any
rate
will
love
you
said
lady
mary
i
will
do
as
i
have
said
continued
miss
boncassen
i
will
do
as
i
have
said
though
i
love
your
brother
down
to
the
ground
he
shall
not
marry
me
without
his
father
consent
then
they
returned
close
together
but
very
little
more
was
said
between
them
when
lady
mary
entered
the
house
she
was
told
that
lady
cantrip
wished
to
see
her
in
her
own
room
chapter
xlviii
the
party
at
custins
is
broken
up
the
message
was
given
to
lady
mary
after
so
solemn
a
fashion
that
she
was
sure
some
important
communication
was
to
be
made
to
her
her
mind
at
that
moment
had
been
filled
with
her
new
friend
story
she
felt
that
she
required
some
time
to
meditate
before
she
could
determine
what
she
herself
would
wish
but
when
she
was
going
to
her
own
room
in
order
that
she
might
think
it
over
she
was
summoned
to
lady
cantrip
my
dear
said
the
countess
i
wish
you
to
do
something
to
oblige
me
of
course
i
will
lord
popplecourt
wants
to
speak
to
you
who
lord
popplecourt
what
can
lord
popplecourt
have
to
say
to
me
can
you
not
guess
lord
popplecourt
is
a
young
nobleman
standing
very
high
in
the
world
possessed
of
ample
means
just
in
that
position
in
which
it
behoves
such
a
man
to
look
about
for
a
wife
lady
mary
pressed
her
lips
together
and
clenched
her
two
hands
can
you
not
imagine
what
such
a
gentleman
may
have
to
say
then
there
was
a
pause
but
she
made
no
immediate
answer
i
am
to
tell
you
my
dear
that
your
father
would
approve
of
it
approve
of
what
he
approves
of
lord
popplecourt
as
a
suitor
for
your
hand
how
can
he
why
not
mary
of
course
he
has
made
it
his
business
to
ascertain
all
particulars
as
to
lord
popplecourt
character
and
property
papa
knows
that
i
love
somebody
else
my
dear
mary
that
is
all
vanity
i
do
think
that
papa
can
want
to
see
me
married
to
a
man
when
he
knows
that
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
oh
mary
when
he
knows
continued
mary
who
would
not
be
put
down
that
i
love
another
man
with
all
my
heart
what
will
lord
popplecourt
say
if
i
tell
him
that
if
he
says
anything
to
me
i
shall
tell
him
lord
popplecourt
he
cares
for
nothing
but
his
of
course
if
you
bid
me
see
him
i
will
but
it
can
do
no
good
i
despise
him
and
if
he
troubles
me
i
shall
hate
him
as
for
marrying
him
i
would
sooner
die
this
minute
after
this
lady
cantrip
did
not
insist
on
the
interview
she
expressed
her
regret
that
things
should
be
as
they
were
explained
in
sweetly
innocent
phrases
that
in
a
certain
rank
of
life
young
ladies
could
not
always
marry
the
gentlemen
to
whom
their
fancies
might
attach
them
but
must
not
unfrequently
postpone
their
youthful
inclinations
to
the
will
of
their
elders
or
in
less
delicate
language
that
though
they
might
love
in
one
direction
they
must
marry
in
another
and
then
expressed
a
hope
that
her
dear
mary
would
think
over
these
things
and
try
to
please
her
father
why
does
he
not
try
to
please
me
said
mary
then
lady
cantrip
was
obliged
to
see
lord
popplecourt
a
necessity
which
was
a
great
nuisance
to
her
yes
she
understands
what
you
mean
but
she
is
not
prepared
for
it
yet
you
must
wait
awhile
i
do
see
why
i
am
to
wait
she
is
very
young
and
so
are
you
indeed
there
is
plenty
of
time
there
is
somebody
else
i
suppose
i
told
you
said
lady
cantrip
in
her
softest
voice
that
there
has
been
a
dream
across
her
path
it
that
tregear
i
am
not
prepared
to
mention
names
said
lady
cantrip
astonished
that
he
should
know
so
much
but
indeed
you
must
wait
i
do
see
it
lady
cantrip
what
can
i
say
more
if
you
think
that
such
a
girl
as
lady
mary
palliser
the
daughter
of
the
duke
of
omnium
possessed
of
fortune
beauty
and
every
good
gift
is
to
come
like
a
bird
to
your
call
you
will
find
yourself
mistaken
all
that
her
friends
can
do
for
you
will
be
done
the
rest
must
remain
with
yourself
during
that
evening
lord
popplecourt
endeavoured
to
make
himself
pleasant
to
one
of
the
fitzhoward
young
ladies
and
on
the
next
morning
he
took
his
leave
of
custins
i
will
never
interfere
again
in
reference
to
anybody
else
child
as
long
as
i
live
lady
cantrip
said
to
her
husband
that
night
lady
mary
was
very
much
tempted
to
open
her
heart
to
miss
boncassen
it
would
be
delightful
to
her
to
have
a
friend
but
were
she
to
engage
miss
boncassen
sympathies
on
her
behalf
she
must
of
course
sympathise
with
miss
boncassen
in
return
and
what
if
after
all
silverbridge
were
not
devoted
to
the
american
beauty
what
if
it
should
turn
out
that
he
was
going
to
marry
lady
mabel
grex
i
wish
you
would
call
me
isabel
her
friend
said
to
her
it
is
so
odd
since
i
have
left
new
york
i
have
never
heard
my
name
from
any
lips
except
father
and
mother
has
not
silverbridge
ever
called
you
by
your
christian
name
i
think
not
i
am
sure
he
never
has
but
he
had
though
it
had
passed
by
her
at
the
moment
without
attention
it
all
came
from
him
so
suddenly
and
yet
i
expected
it
but
it
was
too
sudden
for
christian
names
and
pretty
talk
i
do
not
even
know
what
his
name
is
plantagenet
but
we
always
call
him
silverbridge
plantagenet
is
very
much
prettier
i
shall
always
call
him
plantagenet
but
i
recall
that
you
will
not
remember
that
against
me
i
will
remember
nothing
that
you
do
not
wish
i
mean
that
if
if
all
the
grandeurs
of
all
the
pallisers
could
consent
to
put
up
with
poor
me
if
heaven
were
opened
to
me
with
a
straight
gate
so
that
i
could
walk
out
of
our
republic
into
your
aristocracy
with
my
head
erect
with
the
stars
and
stripes
waving
proudly
round
me
till
i
had
been
accepted
into
the
shelter
of
the
omnium
griffins
then
i
would
call
him
there
one
palliser
would
welcome
you
would
you
dear
then
i
will
love
you
so
dearly
may
i
call
you
mary
of
course
you
may
mary
is
the
prettiest
name
under
the
sun
but
plantagenet
is
so
grand
which
of
the
kings
did
you
branch
off
from
i
know
nothing
about
it
from
none
of
them
i
should
think
there
is
some
story
about
a
sir
guy
who
was
a
king
friend
i
never
trouble
myself
about
it
i
hate
aristocracy
do
you
dear
yes
said
mary
full
of
her
own
grievances
it
is
an
abominable
bondage
and
i
do
not
see
that
it
does
any
good
at
all
i
think
it
is
so
glorious
said
the
american
there
is
no
such
mischievous
nonsense
in
all
the
world
as
equality
that
is
what
father
says
what
men
ought
to
want
is
liberty
it
is
terrible
to
be
tied
up
in
a
small
circle
said
the
daughter
what
do
you
mean
lady
mary
i
thought
you
were
to
call
me
mary
what
i
mean
is
this
suppose
that
silverbridge
loves
you
better
than
all
the
world
i
hope
he
does
i
think
he
does
and
suppose
he
can
not
marry
you
because
of
his
aristocracy
but
he
can
i
thought
you
were
saying
yourself
saying
what
that
he
could
not
marry
me
no
indeed
but
that
under
certain
circumstances
i
would
not
marry
him
you
do
suppose
that
i
think
he
would
be
disgraced
if
so
i
would
go
away
at
once
and
he
should
never
again
see
my
face
or
hear
my
voice
i
think
myself
good
enough
for
the
best
man
god
ever
made
but
if
others
think
differently
and
those
others
are
so
closely
concerned
with
him
and
would
be
so
closely
concerned
with
me
as
to
trouble
our
joint
lives
then
will
i
neither
subject
him
to
such
sorrow
nor
will
i
encounter
it
myself
it
all
comes
from
what
you
call
aristocracy
no
dear
but
from
the
prejudices
of
an
aristocracy
to
tell
the
truth
mary
the
more
difficult
a
place
is
to
get
into
the
more
the
right
of
going
in
is
valued
if
everybody
could
be
a
duchess
and
a
palliser
i
should
not
perhaps
think
so
much
about
it
i
thought
it
was
because
you
loved
him
so
i
do
i
love
him
entirely
i
have
said
not
a
word
of
that
to
him
but
i
do
if
i
know
at
all
what
love
is
but
if
you
love
a
star
the
pride
you
have
in
your
star
will
enhance
your
love
though
you
know
that
you
must
die
of
your
love
still
you
must
love
your
star
and
yet
mary
could
not
tell
her
tale
in
return
she
could
not
show
the
reverse
picture
that
she
being
a
star
was
anxious
to
dispose
of
herself
after
the
fashion
of
poor
human
rushlights
it
was
not
that
she
was
ashamed
of
her
love
but
that
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
yield
altogether
in
reference
to
the
great
descent
which
silverbridge
would
have
to
make
on
the
day
after
this
the
last
day
of
the
duke
sojourn
at
custins
the
last
also
of
the
boncassens
visit
it
came
to
pass
that
the
duke
and
boncassen
with
lady
mary
and
isabel
were
all
walking
in
the
woods
together
and
it
so
happened
when
they
were
at
a
little
distance
from
the
house
each
of
the
girls
was
walking
with
the
other
girl
father
isabel
had
calculated
what
she
would
say
to
the
duke
should
a
time
for
speaking
come
to
her
she
could
not
tell
him
of
his
son
love
she
could
not
ask
his
permission
she
could
not
explain
to
him
all
her
feelings
or
tell
him
what
she
thought
of
her
proper
way
of
getting
into
heaven
that
must
come
afterwards
if
it
should
ever
come
at
all
but
there
was
something
that
she
could
tell
we
are
so
different
from
you
she
said
speaking
of
her
own
country
and
yet
so
like
said
the
duke
smiling
your
language
your
laws
your
habits
but
still
there
is
such
a
difference
i
do
not
think
there
is
a
man
in
the
whole
union
more
respected
than
father
i
dare
say
not
many
people
think
that
if
he
would
only
allow
himself
to
be
put
in
nomination
he
might
be
the
next
president
the
choice
i
am
sure
would
do
your
country
honour
and
yet
his
father
was
a
poor
labourer
who
earned
his
bread
among
the
shipping
at
new
york
that
kind
of
thing
would
be
impossible
here
my
dear
young
lady
there
you
wrong
us
do
i
certainly
a
prime
minister
with
us
might
as
easily
come
from
the
same
class
here
you
think
so
much
of
rank
you
are
a
duke
but
a
prime
minister
can
make
a
duke
and
if
a
man
can
raise
himself
by
his
own
intellect
to
that
position
no
one
will
think
of
his
father
or
his
grandfather
the
sons
of
merchants
have
with
us
been
prime
ministers
more
than
once
and
no
englishmen
ever
were
more
honoured
among
their
countrymen
our
peerage
is
being
continually
recruited
from
the
ranks
of
the
people
and
hence
it
gets
its
strength
is
it
so
there
is
no
greater
mistake
than
to
suppose
that
inferiority
of
birth
is
a
barrier
to
success
in
this
country
she
listened
to
this
and
to
much
more
on
the
same
subject
with
attentive
ears
not
shaken
in
her
ideas
as
to
the
english
aristocracy
in
general
but
thinking
that
she
was
perhaps
learning
something
of
his
own
individual
opinions
if
he
were
more
liberal
than
others
on
that
liberality
might
perhaps
be
based
her
own
happiness
and
fortune
he
in
all
this
was
quite
unconscious
of
the
working
of
her
mind
nor
in
discussing
such
matters
generally
did
he
ever
mingle
his
own
private
feelings
his
own
pride
of
race
and
name
his
own
ideas
of
what
was
due
to
his
ancient
rank
with
the
political
creed
by
which
his
conduct
in
public
life
was
governed
the
peer
who
sat
next
to
him
in
the
house
of
lords
whose
grandmother
had
been
a
washerwoman
and
whose
father
an
innkeeper
was
to
him
every
whit
as
good
a
peer
as
himself
and
he
would
as
soon
sit
in
counsel
with
monk
whose
father
had
risen
from
a
mechanic
to
be
a
merchant
as
with
any
nobleman
who
could
count
ancestors
against
himself
but
there
was
an
inner
feeling
in
his
bosom
as
to
his
own
family
his
own
name
his
own
children
and
his
own
personal
self
which
was
kept
altogether
apart
from
his
grand
political
theories
it
was
a
subject
on
which
he
never
spoke
but
the
feeling
had
come
to
him
as
a
part
of
his
birthright
and
he
conceived
that
it
would
pass
through
him
to
his
children
after
the
same
fashion
it
was
this
which
made
the
idea
of
a
marriage
between
his
daughter
and
tregear
intolerable
to
him
and
which
would
operate
as
strongly
in
regard
to
any
marriage
which
his
son
might
contemplate
lord
grex
was
not
a
man
with
whom
he
would
wish
to
form
any
intimacy
he
was
we
may
say
a
wretched
unprincipled
old
man
bad
all
round
and
such
the
duke
knew
him
to
be
but
the
blue
blood
and
the
rank
were
there
and
as
the
girl
was
good
herself
he
would
have
been
quite
contented
that
his
son
should
marry
the
daughter
of
lord
grex
that
one
and
the
same
man
should
have
been
in
one
part
of
himself
so
unlike
the
other
part
that
he
should
have
one
set
of
opinions
so
contrary
to
another
set
poor
isabel
boncassen
did
not
understand
chapter
xlix
the
major
fate
the
affair
of
prime
minister
and
the
nail
was
not
allowed
to
fade
away
into
obscurity
through
september
and
october
it
was
made
matter
for
pungent
inquiry
the
jockey
club
was
alive
pook
was
very
instant
with
many
pookites
anxious
to
free
themselves
from
suspicion
sporting
men
declared
that
the
honour
of
the
turf
required
that
every
detail
of
the
case
should
be
laid
open
but
by
the
end
of
october
though
every
detail
had
been
surmised
nothing
had
in
truth
been
discovered
nobody
doubted
but
that
tifto
had
driven
the
nail
into
the
horse
foot
and
that
green
and
gilbert
villiers
had
shared
the
bulk
of
the
plunder
they
had
gone
off
on
their
travels
together
and
the
fact
that
each
of
them
had
been
in
possession
of
about
twenty
thousand
pounds
was
proved
but
then
there
is
no
law
against
two
gentlemen
having
such
a
sum
of
money
it
was
notorious
that
captain
green
and
gilbert
villiers
had
enriched
themselves
to
this
extent
by
the
failure
of
prime
minister
but
yet
nothing
was
proved
that
the
major
had
either
himself
driven
in
the
nail
or
seen
it
done
all
racing
men
were
agreed
he
had
been
out
with
the
horse
in
the
morning
and
had
been
the
first
to
declare
that
the
animal
was
lame
and
he
had
been
with
the
horse
till
the
farrier
had
come
but
he
had
concocted
a
story
for
himself
he
did
not
dispute
that
the
horse
had
been
lamed
by
the
machinations
of
green
and
villiers
with
the
assistance
of
the
groom
no
doubt
he
said
these
men
who
had
been
afraid
to
face
an
inquiry
had
contrived
and
had
carried
out
the
iniquity
how
the
lameness
had
been
caused
he
could
not
pretend
to
say
the
groom
who
was
at
the
horse
head
and
who
evidently
knew
how
these
things
were
done
might
have
struck
a
nerve
in
the
foot
with
his
boot
but
when
the
horse
was
got
into
the
stable
he
tifto
so
he
declared
at
once
ran
out
to
send
for
the
farrier
during
the
minutes
so
occupied
the
operation
must
have
been
made
with
the
nail
that
was
tifto
story
and
as
he
kept
his
ground
there
were
some
few
who
believed
it
but
though
the
story
was
so
far
good
he
had
at
moments
been
imprudent
and
had
talked
when
he
should
have
been
silent
the
whole
matter
had
been
a
torment
to
him
in
the
first
place
his
conscience
made
him
miserable
as
long
as
it
had
been
possible
to
prevent
the
evil
he
had
hoped
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
to
lord
silverbridge
up
to
this
period
of
his
life
everything
had
been
square
with
him
he
had
betted
square
and
had
ridden
square
and
had
run
horses
square
he
had
taken
a
pride
in
this
as
though
it
had
been
a
great
virtue
it
was
not
without
great
inward
grief
that
he
had
deprived
himself
of
the
consolations
of
these
reflections
but
when
he
had
approached
his
noble
partner
his
noble
partner
snubbed
him
at
every
turn
and
he
did
the
deed
his
reward
was
to
be
three
thousand
pounds
and
he
got
his
money
the
money
was
very
much
to
him
would
perhaps
have
been
almost
enough
to
comfort
him
in
his
misery
had
not
those
other
rascals
got
so
much
more
when
he
heard
that
the
groom
fee
was
higher
than
his
own
it
almost
broke
his
heart
green
and
villiers
men
of
infinitely
lower
standing
men
at
whom
the
beargarden
would
not
have
looked
had
absolutely
netted
fortunes
on
which
they
could
live
in
comfort
no
doubt
they
had
run
away
while
tifto
still
stood
his
ground
but
he
soon
began
to
doubt
whether
to
have
run
away
with
twenty
thousand
pounds
was
not
better
than
to
remain
with
such
small
plunder
as
had
fallen
to
his
lot
among
such
faces
as
those
which
now
looked
upon
him
then
when
he
had
drunk
a
few
glasses
of
he
said
something
very
foolish
as
to
his
power
of
punishing
that
swindler
green
an
attempt
had
been
made
to
induce
silverbridge
to
delay
the
payment
of
his
bets
but
he
had
been
very
eager
that
they
should
be
paid
under
the
joint
auspices
of
lupton
and
moreton
the
horses
were
sold
and
the
establishment
was
annihilated
with
considerable
loss
but
with
great
despatch
the
duke
had
been
urgent
the
jockey
club
and
the
racing
world
and
the
horsey
fraternity
generally
might
do
what
seemed
to
them
good
so
that
silverbridge
was
extricated
from
the
matter
silverbridge
was
extricated
and
the
duke
cared
nothing
for
the
rest
but
silverbridge
could
not
get
out
of
the
mess
quite
so
easily
as
his
father
wished
two
questions
arose
about
major
tifto
outside
the
racing
world
but
within
the
domain
of
the
world
of
sport
and
pleasure
generally
as
to
one
of
which
it
was
impossible
that
silverbridge
should
not
express
an
opinion
the
first
question
had
reference
to
the
mastership
of
the
runnymede
hounds
in
this
our
young
friend
was
not
bound
to
concern
himself
the
other
affected
the
beargarden
club
and
as
lord
silverbridge
had
introduced
the
major
he
could
hardly
forbear
from
the
expression
of
an
opinion
there
was
a
meeting
of
the
subscribers
to
the
hunt
in
the
last
week
of
october
at
that
meeting
major
tifto
told
his
story
there
he
was
to
answer
any
charge
which
might
be
brought
against
him
if
he
had
made
money
by
losing
the
race
where
was
it
and
whence
had
it
come
was
it
not
clear
that
a
conspiracy
might
have
been
made
without
his
knowledge
and
clear
also
that
the
real
conspirators
had
levanted
he
had
not
levanted
the
hounds
were
his
own
he
had
undertaken
to
hunt
the
country
for
this
season
and
they
had
undertaken
to
pay
him
a
certain
sum
of
money
he
should
expect
and
demand
that
sum
of
money
if
they
chose
to
make
any
other
arrangement
for
the
year
following
they
could
do
so
then
he
sat
down
and
the
meeting
was
adjourned
the
secretary
having
declared
that
he
would
not
act
in
that
capacity
any
longer
nor
collect
the
funds
a
farmer
had
also
asserted
that
he
and
his
friends
had
resolved
that
major
tifto
should
not
ride
over
their
fields
on
the
next
day
the
major
had
his
hounds
out
and
some
of
the
london
men
with
a
few
of
the
neighbours
joined
him
gates
were
locked
but
the
hounds
ran
and
those
who
chose
to
ride
managed
to
follow
them
there
are
men
who
will
stick
to
their
sport
though
apollyon
himself
should
carry
the
horn
who
cares
whether
the
lady
who
fills
a
theatre
be
or
be
not
a
moral
young
woman
or
whether
the
bandmaster
who
keeps
such
excellent
time
in
a
ball
has
or
has
not
paid
his
debts
there
were
men
of
this
sort
who
supported
major
tifto
but
then
there
was
a
general
opinion
that
the
runnymede
hunt
would
come
to
an
end
unless
a
new
master
could
be
found
then
in
the
first
week
in
november
a
special
meeting
was
called
at
the
beargarden
at
which
lord
silverbridge
was
asked
to
attend
it
is
impossible
that
he
should
be
allowed
to
remain
in
the
club
this
was
said
to
lord
silverbridge
by
lupton
either
he
must
go
or
the
club
must
be
broken
up
silverbridge
was
very
unhappy
on
the
occasion
he
had
at
last
been
reasoned
into
believing
that
the
horse
had
been
made
the
victim
of
foul
play
but
he
persisted
in
saying
that
there
was
no
conclusive
evidence
against
tifto
the
matter
was
argued
with
him
tifto
had
laid
bets
against
the
horse
tifto
had
been
with
green
tifto
could
not
have
been
absent
from
the
horse
above
two
minutes
the
thing
could
not
have
been
arranged
without
tifto
as
he
had
brought
tifto
into
the
club
and
had
been
his
partner
on
the
turf
it
was
his
business
to
look
into
the
matter
but
for
all
that
said
he
i
not
going
to
jump
on
a
man
when
he
down
unless
i
feel
sure
that
he
guilty
then
the
meeting
was
held
and
tifto
himself
appeared
when
the
accusation
was
made
by
lupton
who
proposed
that
he
should
be
expelled
he
burst
into
tears
the
whole
story
was
repeated
the
nail
and
the
hammer
and
the
lameness
and
the
moments
were
counted
up
and
poor
tifto
bets
and
friendship
with
green
were
made
apparent
and
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
club
an
old
gentleman
who
had
been
connected
with
the
turf
all
his
life
and
who
would
not
have
scrupled
by
square
betting
to
rob
his
dearest
friend
of
his
last
shilling
seconded
the
proposition
telling
all
the
story
over
again
then
major
tifto
was
asked
whether
he
wished
to
say
anything
i
got
to
say
that
i
here
said
tifto
still
crying
and
if
i
done
anything
of
that
kind
of
course
i
have
gone
with
the
rest
of
i
put
it
to
lord
silverbridge
to
say
whether
i
that
sort
of
fellow
then
he
sat
down
upon
this
there
was
a
pause
and
the
club
was
manifestly
of
opinion
that
lord
silverbridge
ought
to
say
something
i
think
that
major
tifto
should
not
have
betted
against
the
horse
said
silverbridge
i
can
explain
that
said
the
major
let
me
explain
that
everybody
knows
that
i
a
man
of
small
means
i
wanted
to
i
only
wanted
to
lupton
shook
his
head
why
have
you
not
shown
me
your
book
i
told
you
before
that
it
was
stolen
green
got
hold
of
it
i
did
win
a
little
i
never
said
i
did
but
what
has
that
to
do
with
hammering
a
nail
into
a
horse
foot
i
have
always
been
true
to
you
lord
silverbridge
and
you
ought
to
stick
up
for
me
now
i
will
have
nothing
further
to
do
with
the
matter
said
silverbridge
one
way
or
the
other
and
he
walked
out
of
the
room
and
out
of
the
club
the
affair
was
ended
by
a
magnanimous
declaration
on
the
part
of
major
tifto
that
he
would
not
remain
in
a
club
in
which
he
was
suspected
and
by
a
consent
on
the
part
of
the
meeting
to
receive
the
major
instant
resignation
chapter
l
the
duke
arguments
the
duke
before
he
left
custins
had
an
interview
with
lady
cantrip
at
which
that
lady
found
herself
called
upon
to
speak
her
mind
freely
i
do
think
she
cares
about
lord
popplecourt
lady
cantrip
said
i
am
sure
i
do
know
why
she
should
said
the
duke
who
was
often
very
aggravating
even
to
his
friend
but
as
we
had
thought
she
ought
to
do
as
she
is
told
said
the
duke
remembering
how
obedient
his
glencora
had
been
has
he
spoken
to
her
i
think
not
then
how
can
we
tell
i
asked
her
to
see
him
but
she
expressed
so
much
dislike
that
i
could
not
press
it
i
am
afraid
duke
that
you
will
find
it
difficult
to
deal
with
her
i
have
found
it
very
difficult
as
you
have
trusted
me
so
much
yes
i
have
trusted
you
and
do
trust
you
i
hope
you
understand
that
i
appreciate
your
kindness
perhaps
then
you
will
let
me
say
what
i
think
certainly
lady
cantrip
mary
is
a
very
peculiar
girl
with
great
gifts
but
but
what
she
is
obstinate
perhaps
it
would
be
fairer
to
say
that
she
has
great
firmness
of
character
it
is
within
your
power
to
separate
her
from
tregear
it
would
be
foreign
to
her
character
to
to
leave
you
except
with
your
approbation
you
mean
she
will
not
run
away
she
will
do
nothing
without
your
permission
but
she
will
remain
unmarried
unless
she
be
allowed
to
marry
mr
tregear
what
do
you
advise
then
that
you
should
yield
as
regards
money
you
could
give
them
what
they
want
let
him
go
into
public
life
you
could
manage
that
for
him
he
is
conservative
what
does
that
matter
when
the
question
is
one
of
your
happiness
everybody
tells
me
that
he
is
clever
and
well
conducted
he
betrayed
nothing
by
his
face
as
this
was
said
to
him
but
as
he
got
into
the
carriage
he
was
a
miserable
man
it
is
very
well
to
tell
a
man
that
he
should
yield
but
there
is
nothing
so
wretched
to
a
man
as
yielding
young
people
and
women
have
to
yield
but
for
such
a
man
as
this
to
yield
is
in
itself
a
misery
in
this
matter
the
duke
was
quite
certain
of
the
propriety
of
his
judgment
to
yield
would
be
not
only
to
mortify
himself
but
to
do
wrong
at
the
same
time
he
had
convinced
himself
that
the
popplecourt
arrangement
would
come
to
nothing
nor
had
he
and
lady
cantrip
combined
been
able
to
exercise
over
her
the
sort
of
power
to
which
lady
glencora
had
been
subjected
if
he
persevered
and
he
still
was
sure
almost
sure
that
he
would
persevere
his
object
must
be
achieved
after
a
different
fashion
there
must
be
infinite
suffering
suffering
both
to
him
and
to
her
could
she
have
been
made
to
consent
to
marry
someone
else
terrible
as
the
rupture
might
have
been
she
would
have
reconciled
herself
at
last
to
her
new
life
so
it
had
been
with
his
glencora
after
a
time
now
the
misery
must
go
on
from
day
to
day
beneath
his
eyes
with
the
knowledge
on
his
part
that
he
was
crushing
all
joy
out
of
her
young
life
and
the
conviction
on
her
part
that
she
was
being
treated
with
continued
cruelty
by
her
father
it
was
a
terrible
prospect
but
if
it
was
manifestly
his
duty
to
act
after
this
fashion
must
he
not
do
his
duty
if
he
were
to
find
that
by
persevering
in
this
course
he
would
doom
her
to
death
or
perchance
to
madness
what
then
if
it
were
right
he
must
still
do
it
he
must
still
do
it
if
the
weakness
incident
to
his
human
nature
did
not
rob
him
of
the
necessary
firmness
if
every
foolish
girl
were
indulged
all
restraint
would
be
lost
and
there
would
be
an
end
to
those
rules
as
to
birth
and
position
by
which
he
thought
his
world
was
kept
straight
and
then
mixed
with
all
this
was
his
feeling
of
the
young
man
arrogance
in
looking
for
such
a
match
here
was
a
man
without
a
shilling
whose
manifest
duty
it
was
to
go
to
work
so
that
he
might
earn
his
bread
who
instead
of
doing
so
had
hoped
to
raise
himself
to
wealth
and
position
by
entrapping
the
heart
of
an
unwary
girl
there
was
something
to
the
thinking
base
in
this
and
much
more
base
because
the
unwary
girl
was
his
own
daughter
that
such
a
man
as
tregear
should
make
an
attack
upon
him
and
select
his
rank
his
wealth
and
his
child
as
the
by
which
he
intended
to
rise
what
could
be
so
mean
as
that
a
man
should
seek
to
live
by
looking
out
for
a
wife
with
money
but
what
so
impudent
so
arrogant
so
unblushingly
disregardful
of
propriety
as
that
he
should
endeavour
to
select
his
victim
from
such
a
family
as
that
of
the
pallisers
and
that
he
should
lay
his
impious
hand
on
the
very
daughter
of
the
duke
of
omnium
but
together
with
all
this
there
came
upon
him
moments
of
ineffable
tenderness
he
felt
as
though
he
longed
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
tell
her
that
if
she
were
unhappy
so
would
he
be
unhappy
too
to
make
her
understand
that
a
hard
necessity
had
made
this
sorrow
common
to
them
both
he
thought
that
if
she
would
only
allow
it
he
could
speak
of
her
love
as
a
calamity
which
had
befallen
them
as
from
the
hand
of
fate
and
not
as
a
fault
if
he
could
make
a
partnership
in
misery
with
her
so
that
each
might
believe
that
each
was
acting
for
the
best
then
he
could
endure
all
that
might
come
but
as
he
was
well
aware
she
regarded
him
as
being
simply
cruel
to
her
she
did
not
understand
that
he
was
performing
an
imperative
duty
she
had
set
her
heart
upon
a
certain
object
and
having
taught
herself
that
in
that
way
happiness
might
be
reached
had
no
conception
that
there
should
be
something
in
the
world
some
idea
of
personal
dignity
more
valuable
to
her
than
the
fruition
of
her
own
desires
and
yet
every
word
he
spoke
to
her
was
affectionate
he
knew
that
she
was
bruised
and
if
it
might
be
possible
he
would
pour
oil
into
her
wounds
even
though
she
would
not
recognise
the
hand
which
relieved
her
they
slept
one
night
in
town
where
they
encountered
silverbridge
soon
after
his
retreat
from
the
beargarden
i
can
not
quite
make
up
my
mind
sir
about
that
fellow
tifto
he
said
to
his
father
i
hope
you
have
made
up
your
mind
that
he
is
no
fit
companion
for
yourself
that
over
everybody
understands
that
sir
is
anything
more
necessary
i
do
like
feeling
that
he
has
been
they
have
made
him
resign
the
club
and
i
fancy
they
wo
have
him
at
the
hunt
he
has
lost
no
money
by
you
oh
no
then
i
think
you
may
be
indifferent
from
all
that
i
hear
i
think
he
must
have
won
money
which
will
probably
be
a
consolation
to
him
i
think
they
have
been
hard
upon
him
continued
silverbridge
of
course
he
is
not
a
good
man
nor
a
gentleman
nor
possessed
of
very
high
feelings
but
a
man
is
not
to
be
sacrificed
altogether
for
that
there
are
so
many
men
who
are
not
gentlemen
and
so
many
gentlemen
who
are
bad
fellows
i
have
no
doubt
lupton
knew
what
he
was
about
replied
the
duke
on
the
next
morning
the
duke
and
lady
mary
went
down
to
matching
and
as
they
sat
together
in
the
carriage
after
leaving
the
railway
the
father
endeavoured
to
make
himself
pleasant
to
his
daughter
i
suppose
we
shall
stay
at
matching
now
till
christmas
he
said
i
hope
so
whom
would
you
like
to
have
here
i
do
want
any
one
papa
you
will
be
very
sad
without
somebody
would
you
like
the
finns
if
you
please
papa
i
like
her
he
never
talks
anything
but
politics
he
is
none
the
worse
for
that
mary
i
wonder
whether
lady
mabel
grex
would
come
lady
mabel
grex
do
you
not
like
her
oh
yes
i
like
her
but
what
made
you
think
of
her
papa
perhaps
silverbridge
would
come
to
us
then
lady
mary
thought
that
she
knew
a
great
deal
more
about
that
than
her
father
did
is
he
fond
of
lady
mabel
papa
well
i
do
know
there
are
secrets
which
should
not
be
told
i
think
they
are
very
good
friends
i
would
not
have
her
asked
unless
it
would
please
you
i
like
her
very
much
papa
and
perhaps
we
might
get
the
boncassens
to
come
to
us
i
did
say
a
word
to
him
about
it
now
as
mary
felt
difficulty
was
heaping
itself
upon
difficulty
i
have
seldom
met
a
man
in
whose
company
i
could
take
more
pleasure
than
in
that
of
boncassen
and
the
young
lady
seems
to
be
worthy
of
her
father
mary
was
silent
feeling
the
complication
of
the
difficulties
do
you
not
like
her
asked
the
duke
very
much
indeed
said
mary
then
let
us
fix
a
day
and
ask
them
if
you
will
come
to
me
after
dinner
with
an
almanac
we
will
arrange
it
of
course
you
will
invite
that
miss
cassewary
too
the
complication
seemed
to
be
very
bad
indeed
in
the
first
place
was
it
not
clear
that
she
lady
mary
ought
not
to
be
a
party
to
asking
miss
boncassen
to
meet
her
brother
at
matching
would
it
not
be
imperative
on
her
part
to
tell
her
father
the
whole
story
and
yet
how
could
she
do
that
it
had
been
told
her
in
confidence
and
she
remembered
what
her
own
feelings
had
been
when
finn
had
suggested
the
propriety
of
telling
the
story
which
had
been
told
to
her
and
how
would
it
be
possible
to
ask
lady
mabel
to
come
to
matching
to
meet
miss
boncassen
in
the
presence
of
silverbridge
if
the
party
could
be
made
up
without
silverbridge
things
might
run
smoothly
as
she
was
thinking
of
this
in
her
own
room
thinking
also
how
happy
she
could
be
if
one
other
name
might
be
added
to
the
list
of
guests
the
duke
had
gone
alone
into
his
library
there
a
pile
of
letters
reached
him
among
which
he
found
one
marked
private
and
addressed
in
a
hand
which
he
did
not
recognise
this
he
opened
suddenly
with
a
conviction
that
it
would
contain
a
thorn
and
turning
over
the
page
found
the
signature
to
it
was
francis
tregear
the
man
name
was
wormwood
to
him
he
at
once
felt
that
he
would
wish
to
have
his
dinner
his
fragment
of
a
dinner
brought
to
him
in
that
solitary
room
and
that
he
might
remain
secluded
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
but
still
he
must
read
the
letter
and
he
read
it
my
dear
lord
duke
if
my
mode
of
addressing
your
grace
be
too
familiar
i
hope
you
will
excuse
it
it
seems
to
me
that
if
i
were
to
use
one
more
distant
i
should
myself
be
detracting
something
from
my
right
to
make
the
claim
which
i
intend
to
put
forward
you
know
what
my
feelings
are
in
reference
to
your
daughter
i
do
not
pretend
to
suppose
that
they
should
have
the
least
weight
with
you
but
you
know
also
what
her
feelings
are
for
me
a
man
seems
to
be
vain
when
he
expresses
his
conviction
of
a
woman
love
for
himself
but
this
matter
is
so
important
to
her
as
well
as
to
me
that
i
am
compelled
to
lay
aside
all
pretence
if
she
do
not
love
me
as
i
love
her
then
the
whole
thing
drops
to
the
ground
then
it
will
be
for
me
to
take
myself
off
from
out
of
your
notice
and
from
hers
and
to
keep
to
myself
whatever
i
may
have
to
undergo
but
if
she
be
as
steadfast
in
this
matter
as
i
am
if
her
happiness
be
fixed
on
marrying
me
as
mine
is
on
marrying
her
then
i
think
i
am
entitled
to
ask
you
whether
you
are
justified
in
keeping
us
apart
i
know
well
what
are
the
discrepancies
speaking
from
my
own
feeling
i
regard
very
little
those
of
rank
i
believe
myself
to
be
as
good
a
gentleman
as
though
my
forefathers
had
sat
for
centuries
past
in
the
house
of
lords
i
believe
that
you
would
have
thought
so
also
had
you
and
i
been
brought
in
contact
on
any
other
subject
the
discrepancy
in
regard
to
money
is
i
own
a
great
trouble
to
me
having
no
wealth
of
my
own
i
wish
that
your
daughter
were
so
circumstanced
that
i
could
go
out
into
the
world
and
earn
bread
for
her
i
know
myself
so
well
that
i
dare
say
positively
that
her
money
if
it
be
that
she
will
have
money
had
no
attractions
for
me
when
i
first
became
acquainted
with
her
and
adds
nothing
now
to
the
persistency
with
which
i
claim
her
hand
but
i
venture
to
ask
whether
you
can
dare
to
keep
us
apart
if
her
happiness
depends
on
her
love
for
me
it
is
now
more
than
six
months
since
i
called
upon
you
in
london
and
explained
my
wishes
you
will
understand
me
when
i
say
that
i
can
not
be
contented
to
sit
idle
trusting
simply
to
the
assurance
which
i
have
of
her
affection
did
i
doubt
it
my
way
would
be
more
clear
i
should
feel
in
that
case
that
she
would
yield
to
your
wishes
and
i
should
then
as
i
have
said
before
just
take
myself
out
of
the
way
but
if
it
be
not
so
then
i
am
bound
to
do
something
on
her
behalf
as
well
as
my
own
what
am
i
to
do
any
endeavour
to
meet
her
clandestinely
is
against
my
instincts
and
would
certainly
be
rejected
by
her
a
secret
correspondence
would
be
equally
distasteful
to
both
of
us
whatever
i
do
in
this
matter
i
wish
you
to
know
that
i
do
it
yours
always
most
faithfully
and
with
the
greatest
respect
francis
tregear
he
read
the
letter
very
carefully
and
at
first
was
simply
astonished
by
what
he
considered
to
be
the
unparalleled
arrogance
of
the
young
man
in
regard
to
rank
this
young
gentleman
thought
himself
to
be
as
good
as
anybody
else
in
regard
to
money
he
did
acknowledge
some
inferiority
but
that
was
a
misfortune
and
could
not
be
helped
not
only
was
the
letter
arrogant
but
the
fact
that
he
should
dare
to
write
any
letter
on
such
a
subject
was
proof
of
most
unpardonable
arrogance
the
duke
walked
about
the
room
thinking
of
it
till
he
was
almost
in
a
passion
then
he
read
the
letter
again
and
was
gradually
pervaded
by
a
feeling
of
its
manliness
its
arrogance
remained
but
with
its
arrogance
there
was
a
certain
boldness
which
induced
respect
whether
i
am
such
a
as
you
would
like
or
not
it
is
your
duty
to
accept
me
if
by
refusing
to
do
so
you
will
render
your
daughter
miserable
that
was
tregear
argument
he
himself
might
be
prepared
to
argue
in
answer
that
it
was
his
duty
to
reject
such
a
even
though
by
rejecting
him
he
might
make
his
daughter
miserable
he
was
not
shaken
but
with
his
condemnation
of
the
young
man
there
was
mingled
something
of
respect
he
continued
to
digest
the
letter
before
the
hour
of
dinner
and
when
the
almanac
was
brought
to
him
he
fixed
on
certain
days
the
boncassens
he
knew
would
be
free
from
engagements
in
ten
days
time
as
to
lady
mabel
he
seemed
to
think
it
almost
certain
that
she
would
come
i
believe
she
is
always
going
about
from
one
house
to
another
at
this
time
of
the
year
said
mary
i
think
she
will
come
to
us
if
it
be
possible
said
the
duke
and
you
must
write
to
silverbridge
and
what
about
and
mrs
finn
she
promised
she
would
come
again
you
know
they
are
at
their
own
place
in
surrey
they
will
come
unless
they
have
friends
with
them
they
have
no
shooting
and
nothing
brings
people
together
now
except
shooting
i
suppose
there
are
things
here
to
be
shot
and
be
sure
you
write
to
silverbridge
chapter
li
the
duke
guests
the
duke
of
omnium
presents
his
compliments
to
francis
tregear
and
begs
to
acknowledge
the
receipt
of
tregear
letter
of
the
duke
has
no
other
communication
to
make
to
tregear
and
must
beg
to
decline
any
further
correspondence
this
was
the
reply
which
the
duke
wrote
to
the
applicant
for
his
daughter
hand
and
he
wrote
it
at
once
he
had
acknowledged
to
himself
that
tregear
had
shown
a
certain
manliness
in
his
appeal
but
not
on
that
account
was
such
a
man
to
have
all
that
he
demanded
it
seemed
to
the
duke
that
there
was
no
alternative
between
such
a
note
as
that
given
above
and
a
total
surrender
but
the
post
did
not
go
out
during
the
night
and
the
note
lay
hidden
in
the
duke
private
drawer
till
the
morning
there
was
still
that
locus
poenitentiæ
which
should
be
accorded
to
all
letters
written
in
anger
during
the
day
he
thought
over
it
all
constantly
not
in
any
spirit
of
yielding
not
descending
a
single
step
from
that
altitude
of
conviction
which
made
him
feel
that
it
might
be
his
duty
absolutely
to
sacrifice
his
daughter
but
asking
himself
whether
it
might
not
be
well
that
he
should
explain
the
whole
matter
at
length
to
the
young
man
he
thought
he
could
put
the
matter
strongly
it
was
not
by
his
own
doing
that
he
belonged
to
an
aristocracy
which
if
all
exclusiveness
were
banished
from
it
must
cease
to
exist
but
being
what
he
was
having
been
born
to
such
privileges
and
such
limitations
was
he
not
bound
in
duty
to
maintain
a
certain
exclusiveness
he
would
appeal
to
the
young
man
himself
to
say
whether
marriage
ought
to
be
free
between
all
classes
of
the
community
and
if
not
between
all
who
was
to
maintain
the
limits
but
they
to
whom
authority
in
such
matters
is
given
so
much
in
regard
to
rank
and
then
he
would
ask
this
young
man
whether
he
thought
it
fitting
that
a
young
man
whose
duty
according
to
all
known
principles
it
must
be
to
earn
his
bread
should
avoid
that
manifest
duty
by
taking
a
wife
who
could
maintain
him
as
he
roamed
about
his
park
alone
he
felt
that
he
could
write
such
a
letter
as
would
make
an
impression
even
upon
a
lover
but
when
he
had
come
back
to
his
study
other
reflections
came
to
his
aid
though
he
might
write
the
most
appropriate
letter
in
the
world
would
there
not
certainly
be
a
reply
as
to
conviction
had
he
ever
known
an
instance
of
a
man
who
had
been
convinced
by
an
adversary
of
course
there
would
be
a
reply
and
replies
and
to
such
a
correspondence
there
would
be
no
visible
end
words
when
once
written
remain
or
may
remain
in
testimony
for
ever
so
at
last
when
the
moment
came
he
sent
off
those
three
lines
with
his
uncourteous
compliments
and
his
demand
that
there
should
be
no
further
correspondence
at
dinner
he
endeavoured
to
make
up
for
this
harshness
by
increased
tenderness
to
his
daughter
who
was
altogether
ignorant
of
the
correspondence
have
you
written
your
letters
dear
she
said
she
had
written
them
i
hope
the
people
will
come
if
it
will
make
you
comfortable
papa
it
is
for
your
sake
i
wish
them
to
be
here
i
think
that
lady
mabel
and
miss
boncassen
are
just
such
girls
as
you
would
like
i
do
like
them
only
only
what
miss
boncassen
is
an
american
is
that
an
objection
according
to
my
ideas
it
is
desirable
to
become
acquainted
with
persons
of
various
nations
i
have
heard
no
doubt
many
stories
of
the
awkward
manners
displayed
by
american
ladies
if
you
look
for
them
you
may
probably
find
american
women
who
are
not
polished
i
do
not
think
i
shall
calumniate
my
own
country
if
i
say
the
same
of
english
women
it
should
be
our
object
to
select
for
our
own
acquaintances
the
best
we
can
find
of
all
countries
it
seems
to
me
that
miss
boncassen
is
a
young
lady
with
whom
any
other
young
lady
might
be
glad
to
form
an
acquaintance
this
was
a
little
sermon
which
mary
was
quite
contented
to
endure
in
silence
she
was
in
truth
fond
of
the
young
american
beauty
and
had
felt
a
pleasure
in
the
intimacy
which
the
girl
had
proposed
to
her
but
she
thought
it
inexpedient
that
miss
boncassen
lady
mabel
and
silverbridge
should
be
at
matching
together
therefore
she
made
a
reply
to
her
father
sermon
which
hardly
seemed
to
go
to
the
point
at
issue
she
is
so
beautiful
she
said
very
beautiful
said
the
duke
but
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
my
girl
need
not
be
jealous
of
any
girl
beauty
mary
laughed
and
shook
her
head
what
is
it
then
perhaps
silverbridge
might
admire
her
i
have
no
doubt
he
would
or
does
for
i
am
aware
that
they
have
met
but
why
should
he
not
admire
her
i
do
know
said
lady
mary
sheepishly
i
fancy
that
there
is
no
danger
in
that
direction
i
think
silverbridge
understands
what
is
expected
from
him
had
not
silverbridge
plainly
shown
that
he
understood
what
was
expected
from
him
when
he
selected
lady
mabel
nothing
could
have
been
more
proper
and
the
duke
had
been
altogether
satisfied
that
in
such
a
matter
there
should
have
been
a
change
in
so
short
a
time
did
not
occur
to
him
poor
mary
was
now
completely
silenced
she
had
been
told
that
silverbridge
understood
what
was
expected
from
him
and
of
course
could
not
fail
to
carry
home
to
herself
an
accusation
that
she
failed
to
understand
what
was
expected
from
her
she
had
written
her
letters
but
had
not
as
yet
sent
them
those
to
finn
and
to
the
two
young
ladies
had
been
easy
enough
could
and
finn
come
to
matching
on
the
of
november
papa
says
that
you
promised
to
return
and
thinks
this
time
will
perhaps
suit
you
and
then
to
lady
mabel
do
come
if
you
can
and
papa
particularly
says
that
he
hopes
miss
cassewary
will
come
also
to
miss
boncassen
she
had
written
a
long
letter
but
that
too
had
been
written
very
easily
i
write
to
you
instead
of
your
mamma
because
i
know
you
you
must
tell
her
that
and
then
she
will
not
be
angry
i
am
only
papa
messenger
and
i
am
to
say
how
much
he
hopes
that
you
will
come
on
the
boncassen
is
to
bring
the
whole
british
museum
if
he
wishes
then
there
was
a
little
postscript
which
showed
that
there
was
already
considerable
intimacy
between
the
two
young
ladies
we
wo
have
either
or
lord
not
a
word
was
said
about
lord
silverbridge
there
was
not
even
an
initial
to
indicate
his
name
but
the
letter
to
her
brother
was
more
difficult
in
her
epistles
to
those
others
she
had
so
framed
her
words
as
if
possible
to
bring
them
to
matching
but
in
writing
to
her
brother
she
was
anxious
so
to
write
as
to
deter
him
from
coming
she
was
bound
to
obey
her
commands
he
had
desired
that
silverbridge
should
be
asked
to
come
and
he
was
asked
to
come
but
she
craftily
endeavoured
so
to
word
the
invitation
that
he
should
be
induced
to
remain
away
it
is
all
papa
doing
she
said
and
i
am
glad
that
he
should
like
to
have
people
here
i
have
asked
the
finns
with
whom
papa
seems
to
have
made
up
everything
warburton
will
be
here
of
course
and
i
think
moreton
is
coming
he
seems
to
think
that
a
certain
amount
of
shooting
ought
to
be
done
then
i
have
invited
lady
mabel
grex
and
miss
cassewary
all
of
papa
choosing
and
the
boncassens
now
you
will
know
whether
the
set
will
suit
you
papa
has
particularly
begged
that
you
will
come
apparently
because
of
lady
mabel
i
do
at
all
know
what
that
means
perhaps
you
do
as
i
like
lady
mabel
i
hope
she
will
come
surely
silverbridge
would
not
run
himself
into
the
jaws
of
the
lion
when
he
heard
that
he
was
specially
expected
by
his
father
to
come
to
matching
in
order
that
he
might
make
himself
agreeable
to
one
young
lady
he
would
hardly
venture
to
come
seeing
that
he
would
be
bound
to
make
love
to
another
young
lady
to
mary
great
horror
all
the
invitations
were
accepted
and
finn
were
quite
at
the
duke
disposal
that
she
had
expected
the
boncassens
would
all
come
this
was
signified
in
a
note
from
isabel
which
covered
four
sides
of
the
paper
and
was
full
of
fun
but
under
her
signature
had
been
written
a
few
words
not
in
fun
words
which
lady
mary
perfectly
understood
i
wonder
i
wonder
i
wonder
did
the
duke
when
inviting
her
know
anything
of
his
son
inclinations
would
he
be
made
to
know
them
now
during
this
visit
and
what
would
he
say
when
he
did
know
them
that
the
boncassens
would
come
was
a
matter
of
course
but
mary
had
thought
that
lady
mabel
would
refuse
she
had
told
lady
mabel
that
the
boncassens
had
been
asked
and
to
her
thinking
it
had
not
been
improbable
that
the
young
lady
would
be
unwilling
to
meet
her
rival
at
matching
but
the
invitation
was
accepted
but
it
was
her
brother
ready
acquiescence
which
troubled
mary
chiefly
he
wrote
as
though
there
were
no
doubt
about
the
matter
of
course
there
is
a
deal
of
shooting
to
be
done
he
said
and
i
consider
myself
bound
to
look
after
it
there
ought
not
to
be
less
than
four
guns
particularly
if
warburton
is
to
be
one
of
them
i
like
warburton
very
much
and
i
think
he
shoots
badly
to
ingratiate
himself
with
the
governor
i
wonder
whether
the
governor
would
get
leave
for
gerald
for
a
week
he
has
been
sticking
to
his
work
like
a
brick
if
not
would
he
mind
my
bringing
someone
you
ask
the
governor
and
let
me
know
i
be
there
on
the
i
wonder
whether
they
let
me
hear
what
goes
on
among
them
about
politics
i
sure
there
is
not
one
of
them
hates
sir
timothy
worse
than
i
do
lady
mab
is
a
brick
and
i
glad
you
have
asked
her
i
do
think
come
as
she
likes
shutting
herself
up
at
grex
miss
boncassen
is
another
brick
and
if
you
can
manage
about
gerald
i
will
say
that
you
are
a
third
this
would
have
been
all
very
well
had
she
not
known
that
secret
could
it
be
that
miss
boncassen
had
been
mistaken
she
was
forced
to
write
again
to
say
that
her
father
did
not
think
it
right
that
gerald
should
be
brought
away
from
his
studies
for
the
sake
of
shooting
and
that
the
necessary
fourth
gun
would
be
there
in
the
person
of
one
barrington
erle
then
she
added
lady
mabel
grex
is
coming
and
so
is
miss
boncassen
but
to
this
she
received
no
reply
though
silverbridge
had
written
to
his
sister
in
his
usual
careless
style
he
had
considered
the
matter
much
the
three
months
were
over
he
had
no
idea
of
any
hesitation
on
his
part
he
had
asked
her
to
be
his
wife
and
he
was
determined
to
go
on
with
his
suit
had
he
ever
been
enabled
to
make
the
same
request
to
mabel
grex
or
had
she
answered
him
when
he
did
half
make
it
in
a
serious
manner
he
would
have
been
true
to
her
he
had
not
told
his
father
or
his
sister
or
his
friends
as
isabel
had
suggested
he
would
not
do
so
till
he
should
have
received
some
more
certain
answer
from
her
but
in
respect
to
his
love
he
was
prepared
to
be
quite
as
obstinate
as
his
sister
it
was
a
matter
for
his
own
consideration
and
he
would
choose
for
himself
the
three
months
were
over
and
it
was
now
his
business
to
present
himself
to
the
lady
again
that
lady
mabel
should
also
be
at
matching
would
certainly
be
a
misfortune
he
thought
it
probable
that
she
knowing
that
isabel
boncassen
and
he
would
be
there
together
would
refuse
the
invitation
surely
she
ought
to
do
so
that
was
his
opinion
when
he
wrote
to
his
sister
when
he
heard
afterwards
that
she
intended
to
be
there
he
could
only
suppose
that
she
was
prepared
to
accept
the
circumstances
as
they
stood
chapter
lii
miss
boncassen
tells
the
truth
on
the
of
the
month
all
the
guests
came
rattling
in
at
matching
one
after
another
the
boncassens
were
the
first
but
lady
mabel
with
miss
cassewary
followed
them
quickly
then
came
the
finns
and
with
them
barrington
erle
lord
silverbridge
was
the
last
he
arrived
by
a
train
which
reached
the
station
at
and
only
entered
the
house
as
his
father
was
taking
boncassen
into
the
he
dressed
himself
in
ten
minutes
and
joined
the
party
as
they
had
finished
their
fish
i
am
awfully
sorry
he
said
rushing
up
to
his
father
but
i
thought
that
i
should
just
hit
it
there
is
no
occasion
for
awe
said
the
duke
as
a
sufficiency
of
dinner
is
left
but
how
you
should
have
hit
it
as
you
say
seeing
that
the
train
is
not
due
at
bridstock
till
i
do
not
know
i
done
it
often
sir
said
silverbridge
taking
the
seat
left
vacant
for
him
next
to
lady
mabel
we
had
a
political
caucus
of
the
party
all
the
members
who
could
be
got
together
in
london
at
sir
timothy
and
i
was
bound
to
attend
we
all
heard
of
that
said
phineas
finn
and
we
pretty
well
know
all
the
points
of
sir
timothy
eloquence
said
barrington
erle
i
am
not
going
to
tell
any
of
the
secrets
i
have
no
doubt
that
there
were
reporters
present
and
you
will
see
the
whole
of
it
in
the
papers
then
silverbridge
turned
to
his
neighbour
well
lady
mab
and
how
are
you
this
long
time
but
how
are
you
think
what
you
have
gone
through
since
we
were
at
killancodlem
do
talk
of
it
i
suppose
it
is
not
to
be
talked
of
though
upon
the
whole
it
has
happened
very
luckily
i
have
got
rid
of
the
accursed
horses
and
my
governor
has
shown
what
a
brick
he
can
be
i
do
think
there
is
another
man
in
england
who
would
have
done
as
he
did
there
are
not
many
who
could
there
are
fewer
who
would
when
they
came
into
my
bedroom
that
morning
and
told
me
that
the
horse
could
not
run
i
thought
i
should
have
broken
my
heart
seventy
thousand
pounds
gone
seventy
thousand
pounds
and
the
honour
and
glory
of
winning
the
race
and
then
the
feeling
that
one
had
been
so
awfully
swindled
of
course
i
had
to
look
as
though
i
did
not
care
a
straw
about
it
and
to
go
and
see
the
race
with
a
jaunty
air
and
a
cigar
in
my
mouth
that
is
what
i
call
hard
work
but
you
did
it
i
tried
i
wish
i
could
explain
to
you
my
state
of
mind
that
day
in
the
first
place
the
money
had
to
be
got
though
it
was
to
go
into
the
hands
of
swindlers
still
it
had
to
be
paid
i
do
know
how
your
father
and
percival
get
on
together
but
i
felt
very
like
the
prodigal
son
it
is
very
different
with
papa
i
suppose
so
i
felt
very
like
hanging
myself
when
i
was
alone
that
evening
and
now
everything
is
right
again
i
am
glad
that
everything
is
right
she
said
with
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
everything
i
have
done
with
racing
at
any
rate
the
feeling
of
being
in
the
power
of
a
lot
of
low
blackguards
is
so
terrible
i
did
love
the
poor
brute
so
dearly
and
now
what
have
you
been
doing
just
nothing
and
have
seen
nobody
i
went
back
to
grex
after
leaving
killancodlem
and
shut
myself
up
in
my
misery
why
misery
why
misery
what
a
question
for
you
to
ask
though
i
love
grex
i
am
not
altogether
fond
of
living
alone
and
though
grex
has
its
charms
they
are
of
a
melancholy
kind
and
when
i
think
of
the
state
of
our
family
affairs
that
is
not
reassuring
your
father
has
just
paid
seventy
thousand
pounds
for
you
my
father
has
been
good
enough
to
take
something
less
than
a
quarter
of
that
sum
from
me
but
still
it
was
all
that
i
was
ever
to
have
girls
do
want
money
do
they
when
i
look
forward
it
seems
to
me
that
a
time
will
come
when
i
shall
want
it
very
much
you
will
marry
he
said
she
turned
round
for
a
moment
and
looked
at
him
full
in
the
face
after
such
a
fashion
that
he
did
not
dare
to
promise
her
further
comfort
in
that
direction
things
always
do
come
right
somehow
let
us
hope
so
only
nothing
has
ever
come
right
with
me
yet
what
is
frank
doing
i
have
seen
him
since
he
left
and
your
sister
she
whispered
i
know
nothing
about
it
at
all
and
you
i
have
told
you
everything
about
myself
as
for
me
i
think
of
nothing
but
politics
now
i
have
told
you
about
my
racing
experiences
just
at
present
shooting
is
up
before
christmas
i
shall
go
into
chiltern
country
for
a
little
hunting
you
can
hunt
here
i
sha
stay
long
enough
to
make
it
worth
while
to
have
my
horses
down
if
tregear
will
go
with
me
to
the
brake
i
can
mount
him
for
a
day
or
two
but
i
dare
say
you
know
more
of
his
plans
than
i
do
he
went
to
see
you
at
grex
and
you
did
not
i
was
not
asked
nor
was
he
then
all
i
can
say
is
replied
silverbridge
speaking
in
a
low
voice
but
with
considerable
energy
that
he
can
use
a
freedom
with
lady
mabel
grex
upon
which
i
can
not
venture
i
believe
you
begrudge
me
his
friendship
if
you
had
no
one
else
belonging
to
you
with
whom
you
could
have
any
sympathy
would
not
you
find
comfort
in
a
relation
who
could
be
almost
as
near
to
you
as
a
brother
i
do
not
grudge
him
to
you
yes
you
do
and
what
business
have
you
to
interfere
none
at
all
certainly
i
will
never
do
it
again
do
say
that
lord
silverbridge
you
ought
to
have
more
mercy
on
me
you
ought
to
put
up
with
anything
from
me
knowing
how
much
i
suffer
i
will
put
up
with
anything
said
he
do
do
and
now
i
will
try
to
talk
to
mr
erle
miss
boncassen
was
sitting
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
between
monk
and
phineas
finn
and
throughout
the
dinner
talked
mock
politics
with
the
greatest
liveliness
silverbridge
when
he
entered
the
room
had
gone
round
the
table
and
had
shaken
hands
with
everyone
but
there
had
been
no
other
greeting
between
him
and
isabel
nor
had
any
sign
passed
from
one
to
the
other
no
such
greeting
or
sign
had
been
possible
nothing
had
been
left
undone
which
she
had
expected
or
hoped
but
though
she
was
lively
nevertheless
she
kept
her
eye
upon
her
lover
and
lady
mabel
lady
mary
had
said
that
she
thought
her
brother
was
in
love
with
lady
mabel
could
it
be
possible
in
her
own
land
she
had
heard
absurd
stories
stories
which
seemed
to
her
to
be
absurd
of
the
treachery
of
lords
and
countesses
of
the
baseness
of
aristocrats
of
the
iniquities
of
high
life
in
london
but
her
father
had
told
her
that
go
where
she
might
she
would
find
people
in
the
main
to
be
very
like
each
other
it
had
seemed
to
her
that
nothing
could
be
more
ingenuous
than
this
young
man
had
been
in
the
declaration
of
his
love
no
simplest
republican
could
have
spoken
more
plainly
but
now
at
this
moment
she
could
not
doubt
but
that
her
lover
was
very
intimate
with
this
other
girl
of
course
he
was
free
when
she
had
refused
to
say
a
word
to
him
of
her
own
love
or
want
of
love
she
had
necessarily
left
him
his
liberty
when
she
had
put
him
off
for
three
months
of
course
he
was
to
be
his
own
master
but
what
must
she
think
of
him
if
it
were
so
and
how
could
he
have
the
courage
to
face
her
in
his
father
house
if
he
intended
to
treat
her
in
such
a
fashion
but
of
all
this
she
showed
nothing
nor
was
there
a
tone
in
her
voice
which
betrayed
her
she
said
her
last
word
to
monk
with
so
sweet
a
smile
that
that
old
bachelor
wished
he
were
younger
for
her
sake
in
the
evening
after
dinner
there
was
music
it
was
discovered
that
miss
boncassen
sang
divinely
and
both
lady
mabel
and
lady
mary
accompanied
her
erle
and
warburton
and
monk
all
of
whom
were
unmarried
stood
by
enraptured
but
lord
silverbridge
kept
himself
apart
and
interested
himself
in
a
description
which
boncassen
gave
him
of
their
young
men
and
their
young
ladies
in
the
states
he
had
hardly
spoken
to
miss
boncassen
till
he
offered
her
sherry
or
before
she
retired
for
the
night
she
refused
his
courtesy
with
her
usual
smile
but
showed
no
more
emotion
than
though
they
two
had
now
met
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
he
had
quite
made
up
his
mind
as
to
what
he
would
do
when
the
opportunity
should
come
in
his
way
he
would
simply
remind
her
that
the
three
months
were
passed
but
he
was
shy
of
talking
to
her
in
the
presence
of
lady
mabel
and
his
father
he
was
quite
determined
that
the
thing
should
be
done
at
once
but
he
certainly
wished
that
lady
mabel
had
not
been
there
in
what
she
had
said
to
him
at
the
she
had
made
him
understand
that
she
would
be
a
trouble
to
him
he
remembered
her
look
when
he
told
her
she
would
marry
it
was
as
though
she
had
declared
to
him
that
it
was
he
who
ought
to
be
her
husband
it
referred
back
to
that
proffer
of
love
which
he
had
once
made
to
her
of
course
all
this
was
disagreeable
of
course
it
made
things
difficult
for
him
but
not
the
less
was
it
a
thing
quite
assured
that
he
would
press
his
suit
to
miss
boncassen
when
he
was
talking
to
boncassen
he
was
thinking
of
nothing
else
when
he
was
offering
isabel
the
glass
of
sherry
he
was
telling
himself
that
he
would
find
his
opportunity
on
the
morrow
though
now
at
that
moment
it
was
impossible
that
he
should
make
a
sign
she
as
she
went
to
bed
asked
herself
whether
it
were
possible
that
there
should
be
such
treachery
whether
it
were
possible
that
he
should
pass
it
all
by
as
though
he
had
never
said
a
word
to
her
during
the
whole
of
the
next
day
which
was
sunday
he
was
equally
silent
immediately
after
breakfast
on
the
monday
shooting
commenced
and
he
could
not
find
a
moment
in
which
to
speak
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
purposely
kept
out
of
his
way
with
mabel
he
did
find
himself
for
a
few
minutes
alone
and
was
then
interrupted
by
his
sister
and
isabel
i
hope
you
have
killed
a
lot
of
things
said
miss
boncassen
pretty
well
among
us
all
what
an
odd
amusement
it
seems
going
out
to
commit
wholesale
slaughter
however
it
is
the
proper
thing
no
doubt
quite
the
proper
thing
said
lord
silverbridge
and
that
was
all
on
the
next
morning
he
dressed
himself
for
shooting
and
then
sent
out
the
party
without
him
he
had
heard
he
said
of
a
young
horse
for
sale
in
the
neighbourhood
and
had
sent
to
desire
that
it
might
be
brought
to
him
and
now
he
found
his
occasion
come
and
play
a
game
of
billiards
he
said
to
isabel
as
the
three
girls
with
the
other
ladies
were
together
in
the
she
got
up
very
slowly
from
her
seat
and
very
slowly
crept
away
to
the
door
then
she
looked
round
as
though
expecting
the
others
to
follow
her
none
of
them
did
follow
her
mary
felt
that
she
ought
to
do
so
but
knowing
all
that
she
knew
did
not
dare
and
what
good
could
she
have
done
by
one
such
interruption
lady
mabel
would
fain
have
gone
too
but
neither
did
she
quite
dare
had
there
been
no
special
reason
why
she
should
or
should
not
have
gone
with
them
the
thing
would
have
been
easy
enough
when
two
people
go
to
play
billiards
a
third
may
surely
accompany
them
but
now
lady
mabel
found
that
she
could
not
stir
finn
boncassen
and
miss
cassewary
were
all
in
the
room
but
none
of
them
moved
silverbridge
led
the
way
quickly
across
the
hall
and
isabel
boncassen
followed
him
very
slowly
when
she
entered
the
room
she
found
him
standing
with
a
cue
in
his
hand
he
at
once
shut
the
door
and
walking
up
to
her
dropped
the
butt
of
the
cue
on
the
floor
and
spoke
one
word
well
he
said
what
does
mean
the
three
months
are
over
certainly
they
are
and
i
have
been
a
model
of
patience
perhaps
your
patience
is
more
remarkable
than
your
constancy
is
not
lady
mabel
grex
in
the
ascendant
just
now
what
do
you
mean
by
that
why
do
you
ask
that
you
told
me
to
wait
for
three
months
i
have
waited
and
here
i
am
how
very
very
downright
you
are
is
not
that
the
proper
thing
i
thought
i
was
downright
but
you
beat
me
hollow
yes
the
three
months
are
over
and
now
what
have
you
got
to
say
he
put
down
his
cue
and
stretched
out
his
arms
as
though
he
were
going
to
take
her
and
hold
her
to
his
heart
no
no
not
that
she
said
laughing
but
if
you
will
speak
i
will
hear
you
you
know
what
i
said
before
will
you
love
me
isabel
and
you
know
what
i
said
before
do
they
know
that
you
love
me
does
your
father
know
it
and
your
sister
why
did
they
ask
me
to
come
here
nobody
knows
it
but
say
that
you
love
me
and
everyone
shall
know
it
at
once
yes
one
person
knows
it
why
did
you
mention
lady
mabel
name
she
knows
it
did
you
tell
her
yes
i
went
again
to
killancodlem
after
you
were
gone
and
then
i
told
her
but
why
her
come
lord
silverbridge
you
are
straightforward
with
me
and
i
will
be
the
same
with
you
you
have
told
lady
mabel
i
have
told
lady
mary
my
sister
yes
your
sister
and
i
am
sure
she
disapproves
it
she
did
not
say
so
but
i
am
sure
it
is
so
and
then
she
told
me
something
what
did
she
tell
you
has
there
never
been
reason
to
think
that
you
intended
to
offer
your
hand
to
lady
mabel
grex
did
she
tell
you
so
you
should
answer
my
question
lord
silverbridge
it
is
surely
one
which
i
have
a
right
to
ask
then
she
stood
waiting
for
his
reply
keeping
herself
at
some
little
distance
from
him
as
though
she
were
afraid
that
he
would
fly
upon
her
and
indeed
there
seemed
to
be
cause
for
such
fear
from
the
frequent
gestures
of
his
hands
why
do
you
not
answer
me
has
there
been
reason
for
such
expectations
yes
there
has
there
has
i
thought
of
it
not
knowing
myself
before
i
had
seen
you
you
shall
know
it
all
if
you
will
only
say
that
you
love
me
i
should
like
to
know
it
all
first
you
do
know
it
all
almost
i
have
told
you
that
she
knows
what
i
said
to
you
at
killancodlem
is
not
that
enough
and
she
approves
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
lady
mabel
is
my
friend
but
not
my
guardian
has
she
a
right
to
expect
that
she
should
be
your
wife
no
certainly
not
why
should
you
ask
all
this
do
you
love
me
come
isabel
say
that
you
love
me
will
you
call
me
vain
if
i
say
that
i
almost
think
you
do
you
can
not
doubt
about
my
love
not
now
no
not
now
you
need
why
wo
you
be
as
honest
to
me
if
you
hate
me
say
so
but
if
you
love
me
i
do
not
hate
you
lord
silverbridge
and
is
that
all
you
asked
me
the
question
but
you
do
love
me
by
george
i
thought
you
would
be
more
honest
and
straightforward
then
she
dropped
her
badinage
and
answered
him
seriously
i
thought
i
had
been
honest
and
straightforward
when
i
found
that
you
were
in
earnest
at
killancodlem
why
did
you
ever
doubt
me
when
i
felt
that
you
were
in
earnest
then
i
had
to
be
in
earnest
too
and
i
thought
so
much
about
it
that
i
lay
awake
nearly
all
that
night
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
thought
tell
me
something
that
i
should
like
to
hear
i
will
tell
you
the
truth
it
possible
i
said
to
myself
such
a
man
as
that
can
want
me
to
be
his
wife
he
an
englishman
of
the
highest
rank
and
the
greatest
wealth
and
one
that
any
girl
in
the
world
would
love
psha
he
exclaimed
that
is
what
i
said
to
myself
then
she
paused
and
looking
into
her
face
he
saw
that
there
was
a
glimmer
of
a
tear
in
each
eye
one
that
any
girl
must
love
when
asked
for
her
love
because
he
is
so
sweet
so
good
and
so
pleasant
i
know
that
you
are
chaffing
then
i
went
on
asking
myself
questions
and
is
it
possible
that
i
who
by
all
his
friends
will
be
regarded
as
a
nobody
who
am
an
american
with
merely
human
workaday
blood
in
my
veins
that
such
a
one
as
i
should
become
his
wife
then
i
told
myself
that
it
was
not
possible
it
was
not
in
accordance
with
the
fitness
of
things
all
the
dukes
in
england
would
rise
up
against
it
and
especially
that
duke
whose
would
be
imperative
why
should
he
rise
up
against
it
you
know
he
will
but
i
will
go
on
with
my
story
of
myself
when
i
had
settled
that
in
my
mind
i
just
cried
myself
to
sleep
it
had
been
a
dream
i
had
come
across
one
who
in
his
own
self
seemed
to
combine
all
that
i
had
ever
thought
of
as
being
lovable
in
a
man
isabel
and
in
his
outward
circumstances
soared
as
much
above
my
thoughts
as
the
heaven
is
above
the
earth
and
he
had
whispered
to
me
soft
loving
heavenly
words
no
no
you
shall
not
touch
me
but
you
shall
listen
to
me
in
my
sleep
i
could
be
happy
again
and
not
see
the
barriers
but
when
i
woke
i
made
up
my
mind
he
comes
to
me
again
i
said
it
should
be
that
he
should
come
to
me
again
i
will
tell
him
that
he
shall
be
my
heaven
on
earth
if
if
if
the
of
his
friends
would
not
make
that
heaven
a
hell
to
both
of
us
i
did
not
tell
you
quite
all
that
you
told
me
nothing
but
that
i
was
to
come
again
in
three
months
i
said
more
than
that
i
bade
you
ask
your
father
now
you
have
come
again
you
can
not
understand
a
girl
fears
and
doubts
how
should
you
i
thought
perhaps
you
would
not
come
when
i
saw
you
whispering
to
that
beauty
and
remembered
what
i
was
myself
i
thought
that
you
would
not
come
then
you
must
love
me
love
you
oh
my
darling
no
no
no
she
said
as
she
retreated
from
him
round
the
corner
of
the
and
stood
guarding
herself
from
him
with
her
little
hands
you
ask
if
i
love
you
you
are
entitled
to
know
the
truth
from
the
sole
of
your
foot
to
the
crown
of
your
head
i
love
you
as
i
think
a
man
would
wish
to
be
loved
by
the
girl
he
loves
you
have
come
across
my
life
and
have
swallowed
me
up
and
made
me
all
your
own
but
i
will
not
marry
you
to
be
rejected
by
your
people
no
nor
shall
there
be
a
kiss
between
us
till
i
know
that
it
will
not
be
so
may
i
speak
to
your
father
for
what
good
i
have
not
spoken
to
father
or
mother
because
i
have
known
that
it
must
depend
upon
your
father
lord
silverbridge
if
he
will
tell
me
that
i
shall
be
his
daughter
i
will
become
your
wife
oh
with
such
perfect
joy
with
such
perfect
truth
if
it
can
never
be
so
then
let
us
be
torn
apart
with
whatever
struggle
still
at
once
in
that
case
i
will
get
myself
back
to
my
own
country
as
best
i
may
and
will
pray
to
god
that
all
this
may
be
forgotten
then
she
made
her
way
round
to
the
door
leaving
him
fixed
to
the
spot
in
which
she
had
been
standing
but
as
she
went
she
made
a
little
prayer
to
him
do
not
delay
my
fate
it
is
all
in
all
to
me
and
so
he
was
left
alone
in
the
chapter
liii
then
i
am
as
proud
as
a
queen
during
the
next
day
or
two
the
shooting
went
on
without
much
interruption
from
the
was
not
prosperous
all
round
poor
lady
mary
had
nothing
to
comfort
her
could
she
have
been
allowed
to
see
the
letter
which
her
lover
had
written
to
her
father
the
comfort
would
have
been
if
not
ample
still
very
great
mary
told
herself
again
and
again
that
she
was
quite
sure
of
tregear
but
it
was
hard
upon
her
that
she
could
not
be
made
certain
that
her
certainty
was
well
grounded
had
she
known
that
tregear
had
written
though
she
had
not
seen
a
word
of
his
letter
it
would
have
comforted
her
but
she
had
heard
nothing
of
the
letter
in
june
last
she
had
seen
him
by
chance
for
a
few
minutes
in
lady
mabel
since
that
she
had
not
heard
from
him
or
of
him
that
was
now
more
than
five
months
since
how
could
her
love
serve
her
how
could
her
very
life
serve
her
if
things
were
to
go
on
like
that
how
was
she
to
bear
it
thinking
of
this
she
resolved
she
almost
resolved
that
she
would
go
boldly
to
her
father
and
desire
that
she
might
be
given
up
to
her
lover
her
brother
though
more
triumphant
for
how
could
he
fail
to
triumph
after
such
words
as
isabel
had
spoken
to
him
still
felt
his
difficulties
very
seriously
she
had
imbued
him
with
a
strong
sense
of
her
own
firmness
and
she
had
declared
that
she
would
go
away
and
leave
him
altogether
if
the
duke
should
be
unwilling
to
receive
her
he
knew
that
the
duke
would
be
unwilling
the
duke
who
certainly
was
not
handy
in
those
duties
of
which
seemed
to
have
fallen
upon
him
at
the
death
of
his
wife
showed
by
a
hundred
little
signs
his
anxiety
that
his
son
and
heir
should
arrange
his
affairs
with
lady
mabel
these
signs
were
manifest
to
mary
were
disagreeably
manifest
to
silverbridge
were
unfortunately
manifest
to
lady
mabel
herself
they
were
manifest
to
finn
who
was
clever
enough
to
perceive
that
the
inclinations
of
the
young
heir
were
turned
in
another
direction
and
gradually
they
became
manifest
to
isabel
boncassen
the
host
himself
as
host
was
courteous
to
all
his
guests
they
had
been
of
his
own
selection
and
he
did
his
best
to
make
himself
pleasant
to
them
all
but
he
selected
two
for
his
peculiar
notice
and
those
two
were
miss
boncassen
and
lady
mabel
while
he
would
himself
walk
and
talk
and
argue
after
his
own
peculiar
fashion
with
the
american
beauty
explaining
to
her
matters
political
and
social
till
he
persuaded
her
to
promise
to
read
his
pamphlet
upon
decimal
coinage
he
was
always
making
awkward
efforts
to
throw
silverbridge
and
lady
mabel
together
the
two
girls
saw
it
all
and
knew
well
how
the
matter
was
knew
that
they
were
rivals
and
knew
each
the
ground
on
which
she
herself
and
on
which
the
other
stood
but
neither
was
satisfied
with
her
advantage
or
nearly
satisfied
isabel
would
not
take
the
prize
without
the
consent
and
mabel
could
not
have
it
without
that
other
consent
if
you
want
to
marry
an
english
duke
she
once
said
to
isabel
in
that
anger
which
she
was
unable
to
restrain
there
is
the
duke
himself
i
never
saw
a
man
more
absolutely
in
love
but
i
do
not
want
to
marry
an
english
duke
said
isabel
and
i
pity
any
girl
who
has
any
idea
of
marriage
except
that
which
comes
from
a
wish
to
give
back
love
for
love
through
it
all
the
father
never
suspected
the
real
state
of
his
mind
he
was
too
simple
to
think
it
possible
that
the
purpose
which
silverbridge
had
declared
to
him
as
they
walked
together
from
the
beargarden
had
already
been
thrown
to
the
winds
he
did
not
like
to
ask
why
the
thing
was
not
settled
young
men
he
thought
were
sometimes
shy
and
young
ladies
not
always
ready
to
give
immediate
encouragement
but
when
he
saw
them
together
he
concluded
that
matters
were
going
in
the
right
direction
it
was
however
an
opinion
which
he
had
all
to
himself
during
the
three
or
four
days
which
followed
the
scene
in
the
isabel
kept
herself
out
of
her
lover
way
she
had
explained
to
him
that
which
she
wished
him
to
do
and
she
left
him
to
do
it
day
by
day
she
watched
the
circumstances
of
the
life
around
her
and
knew
that
it
had
not
been
done
she
was
sure
that
it
could
not
have
been
done
while
the
duke
was
explaining
to
her
the
beauty
of
quints
and
expatiating
on
the
horrors
of
twelve
pennies
and
twelve
inches
and
twelve
ounces
variegated
in
some
matters
by
sixteen
and
fourteen
he
could
not
know
that
she
was
ambitious
of
becoming
his
while
he
was
opening
out
to
her
the
mysteries
of
the
house
of
lords
and
explaining
how
it
came
to
pass
that
while
he
was
a
member
of
one
house
of
parliament
his
son
should
be
sitting
as
a
member
of
another
how
it
was
that
a
nobleman
could
be
a
commoner
and
how
a
peer
of
one
part
of
the
empire
could
sit
as
the
representative
of
a
borough
in
another
part
she
was
an
apt
scholar
had
there
been
a
question
of
any
other
young
man
marrying
her
he
would
probably
have
thought
that
no
other
young
man
could
have
done
better
silverbridge
was
discontented
with
himself
the
greatest
misfortune
was
that
lady
mabel
should
be
there
while
she
was
present
to
his
father
eyes
he
did
not
know
how
to
declare
his
altered
wishes
every
now
and
then
she
would
say
to
him
some
little
word
indicating
her
feelings
of
the
absurdity
of
his
passion
i
declare
i
do
know
whether
it
is
you
or
your
father
that
miss
boncassen
most
affects
she
said
but
to
this
and
to
other
similar
speeches
he
would
make
no
answer
she
had
extracted
his
secret
from
him
at
killancodlem
and
might
use
it
against
him
if
she
pleased
in
his
present
frame
of
mind
he
was
not
disposed
to
joke
with
her
upon
the
subject
on
that
second
sunday
the
boncassens
were
to
return
to
london
on
the
following
tuesday
he
found
himself
alone
with
isabel
father
the
american
had
been
brought
out
at
his
own
request
to
see
the
stables
and
had
been
accompanied
round
the
premises
by
silverbridge
and
by
warburton
by
isabel
and
by
lady
mary
as
they
got
out
into
the
park
the
party
were
divided
and
silverbridge
found
himself
with
boncassen
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
proper
thing
for
a
young
man
in
love
was
to
go
not
to
his
own
father
but
to
the
lady
father
why
should
not
he
do
as
others
always
did
isabel
no
doubt
had
suggested
a
different
course
but
that
which
isabel
had
suggested
was
at
the
present
moment
impossible
to
him
now
at
this
instant
without
a
moment
forethought
he
determined
to
tell
his
story
to
isabel
father
as
any
other
lover
might
tell
it
to
any
other
father
i
am
very
glad
to
find
ourselves
alone
boncassen
he
said
boncassen
bowed
and
showed
himself
prepared
to
listen
though
so
many
at
matching
had
seen
the
whole
play
boncassen
had
seen
nothing
of
it
i
do
know
whether
you
are
aware
of
what
i
have
got
to
say
i
can
not
quite
say
that
i
am
my
lord
but
whatever
it
is
i
am
sure
i
shall
be
delighted
to
hear
it
i
want
to
marry
your
daughter
said
silverbridge
isabel
had
told
him
that
he
was
downright
and
in
such
a
matter
he
had
hardly
as
yet
learned
how
to
express
himself
with
those
paraphrases
in
which
the
world
delights
boncassen
stood
stock
still
and
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
pulled
off
his
hat
the
proper
thing
is
to
ask
your
permission
to
go
on
with
it
you
want
to
marry
my
daughter
yes
that
is
what
i
have
got
to
say
is
she
aware
of
your
intention
quite
aware
i
believe
i
may
say
that
if
other
things
go
straight
she
will
consent
and
your
father
the
duke
he
knows
nothing
about
it
as
yet
really
this
takes
me
quite
by
surprise
i
am
afraid
you
have
not
given
enough
thought
to
the
matter
i
have
been
thinking
about
it
for
the
last
three
months
said
lord
silverbridge
marriage
is
a
very
serious
thing
of
course
it
is
and
men
generally
like
to
marry
their
equals
i
do
know
about
that
i
do
think
that
counts
for
much
people
do
always
know
who
are
their
equals
that
is
quite
true
if
i
were
speaking
to
you
or
to
your
father
theoretically
i
should
perhaps
be
unwilling
to
admit
superiority
on
your
side
because
of
your
rank
and
wealth
i
could
make
an
argument
in
favour
of
any
equality
with
the
best
briton
that
ever
lived
as
would
become
a
republican
that
is
just
what
i
mean
but
when
the
question
becomes
one
of
practising
a
question
for
our
lives
for
our
happiness
for
our
own
conduct
then
knowing
what
must
be
the
feelings
of
an
aristocracy
in
such
a
country
as
this
i
am
prepared
to
admit
that
your
father
would
be
as
well
justified
in
objecting
to
a
marriage
between
a
child
of
his
and
a
child
of
mine
as
i
should
be
in
objecting
to
one
between
my
child
and
the
son
of
some
mechanic
in
our
native
city
he
would
be
a
gentleman
said
silverbridge
that
is
a
word
of
which
i
do
quite
know
the
meaning
i
do
said
silverbridge
confidently
but
you
could
not
define
it
if
a
man
be
well
educated
and
can
keep
a
good
house
over
his
head
perhaps
you
may
call
him
a
gentleman
but
there
are
many
such
with
whom
your
father
would
not
wish
to
be
so
closely
connected
as
you
propose
but
i
may
have
your
sanction
boncassen
again
took
off
his
hat
and
walked
along
thoughtfully
i
hope
you
do
object
to
me
personally
my
dear
young
lord
your
father
has
gone
out
of
his
way
to
be
civil
to
me
am
i
to
return
his
courtesy
by
bringing
a
great
trouble
upon
him
he
seems
to
be
very
fond
of
miss
boncassen
will
he
continue
to
be
fond
of
her
when
he
has
heard
this
what
does
isabel
say
she
says
the
same
as
you
of
course
why
of
course
except
that
it
is
evident
to
you
as
it
is
to
me
that
she
could
not
with
propriety
say
anything
else
i
think
she
would
would
like
it
you
know
she
would
like
to
be
your
wife
well
yes
if
it
were
all
serene
i
think
she
would
consent
i
dare
say
she
would
consent
if
it
were
all
serene
why
should
she
not
do
not
try
her
too
hard
lord
silverbridge
you
say
you
love
her
i
do
indeed
then
think
of
the
position
in
which
you
are
placing
her
you
are
struggling
to
win
her
heart
silverbridge
as
he
heard
this
assured
himself
that
there
was
no
need
for
any
further
struggling
in
that
direction
perhaps
you
have
won
it
yet
she
may
feel
that
she
can
not
become
your
wife
she
may
well
say
to
herself
that
this
which
is
offered
to
her
is
so
great
that
she
does
not
know
how
to
refuse
it
and
may
yet
have
to
say
at
the
same
time
that
she
can
not
accept
it
without
disgrace
you
would
not
put
one
that
you
love
into
such
a
position
as
for
disgrace
that
is
nonsense
i
beg
your
pardon
mr
boncassen
would
it
be
no
disgrace
that
she
should
be
known
here
in
england
to
be
your
wife
and
that
none
of
those
of
your
rank
of
what
would
then
be
her
own
rank
should
welcome
her
into
her
new
world
that
would
be
out
of
the
question
if
your
own
father
refused
to
welcome
her
would
not
others
follow
suit
you
do
know
my
father
you
seem
to
know
him
well
enough
to
fear
that
he
would
object
yes
that
is
true
what
more
do
i
want
to
know
if
she
were
once
my
wife
he
would
not
reject
her
of
all
human
beings
he
is
in
truth
the
kindest
and
most
affectionate
and
therefore
you
would
try
him
after
this
fashion
no
my
lord
i
can
not
see
my
way
through
these
difficulties
you
can
say
what
you
please
to
him
as
to
your
own
wishes
but
you
must
not
tell
him
that
you
have
any
sanction
from
me
that
evening
the
story
was
told
to
boncassen
and
the
matter
was
discussed
among
the
family
isabel
in
talking
to
them
made
no
scruple
of
declaring
her
own
feelings
and
though
in
speaking
to
lord
silverbridge
she
had
spoken
very
much
as
her
father
had
done
afterwards
yet
in
this
family
conclave
she
took
her
lover
part
that
is
all
very
well
father
she
said
i
told
him
the
same
thing
myself
but
if
he
is
man
enough
to
be
firm
i
shall
not
throw
him
over
not
for
all
the
dukes
in
europe
i
shall
not
stay
here
to
be
pointed
at
i
will
go
back
home
if
he
follows
me
then
i
shall
choose
to
forget
all
about
his
rank
if
he
loves
me
well
enough
to
show
that
he
is
in
earnest
i
shall
not
disappoint
him
for
the
sake
of
pleasing
his
father
to
this
neither
nor
boncassen
was
able
to
make
any
efficient
answer
boncassen
dear
good
woman
could
see
no
reason
why
two
young
people
who
loved
each
other
should
not
be
married
at
once
dukes
and
duchesses
were
nothing
to
her
if
they
could
be
happy
in
england
then
let
them
come
and
live
in
new
york
she
did
understand
that
anybody
could
be
too
good
for
her
daughter
was
there
not
an
idea
that
boncassen
would
be
the
next
president
and
was
not
the
president
of
the
united
states
as
good
as
the
queen
of
england
lord
silverbridge
when
he
left
boncassen
wandered
about
the
park
by
himself
king
cophetua
married
the
beggar
daughter
he
was
sure
of
that
king
cophetua
probably
had
not
a
father
and
the
beggar
probably
was
not
but
the
discrepancy
in
that
case
was
much
greater
he
intended
to
persevere
trusting
much
to
a
belief
that
when
once
he
was
married
his
father
would
come
round
his
father
always
did
come
round
but
the
more
he
thought
of
it
the
more
impossible
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
should
ask
his
consent
at
the
present
moment
lady
mabel
presence
in
the
house
was
an
insuperable
obstacle
he
thought
that
he
could
do
it
if
he
and
his
father
were
alone
together
or
comparatively
alone
he
must
be
prepared
for
an
opposition
at
any
rate
of
some
days
which
opposition
would
make
his
father
quite
unable
to
entertain
his
guests
while
it
lasted
but
as
he
could
not
declare
his
wishes
to
his
father
and
was
thus
disobeying
isabel
behests
he
must
explain
the
difficulty
to
her
he
felt
already
that
she
would
despise
him
for
his
cowardice
that
she
would
not
perceive
the
difficulties
in
his
way
or
understand
that
he
might
injure
his
cause
by
precipitation
then
he
considered
whether
he
might
not
possibly
make
some
bargain
with
his
father
how
would
it
be
if
he
should
consent
to
go
back
to
the
liberal
party
on
being
allowed
to
marry
the
girl
he
loved
as
far
as
his
political
feelings
were
concerned
he
did
not
think
that
he
would
much
object
to
make
the
change
there
was
only
one
thing
certain
that
he
must
explain
his
condition
to
miss
boncassen
before
she
went
he
found
no
difficulty
now
in
getting
the
opportunity
she
was
equally
anxious
and
as
well
disposed
to
acknowledge
her
anxiety
after
what
had
passed
between
them
she
was
not
desirous
of
pretending
that
the
matter
was
one
of
small
moment
to
herself
she
had
told
him
that
it
was
all
the
world
to
her
and
had
begged
him
to
let
her
know
her
fate
as
quickly
as
possible
on
that
last
monday
morning
they
were
in
the
grounds
together
and
lady
mabel
who
was
walking
with
finn
saw
them
pass
through
a
little
gate
which
led
from
the
gardens
into
the
priory
ruins
it
all
means
nothing
mabel
said
with
a
little
laugh
to
her
companion
if
so
i
am
sorry
for
the
young
lady
said
finn
do
you
think
that
one
always
has
to
be
sorry
for
the
young
ladies
young
ladies
generally
have
a
bad
time
of
it
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
gentleman
who
had
always
to
roll
a
stone
to
the
top
of
a
hill
but
it
would
always
come
back
upon
him
that
gentleman
i
believe
never
succeeded
said
finn
the
young
ladies
i
suppose
do
sometimes
in
the
meantime
isabel
and
silverbridge
were
among
the
ruins
together
this
is
where
the
old
pallisers
used
to
be
buried
he
said
oh
indeed
and
married
i
suppose
i
dare
say
they
had
a
priest
of
their
own
no
doubt
which
must
have
been
convenient
this
block
of
a
fellow
without
any
legs
left
is
supposed
to
represent
sir
guy
he
ran
away
with
heiresses
they
say
i
wish
things
were
as
easily
done
now
nobody
should
have
run
away
with
me
i
have
no
idea
of
going
on
such
a
journey
except
on
terms
of
equality
just
step
and
step
alike
then
she
took
hold
of
his
arm
and
put
out
one
foot
are
you
ready
i
am
very
willing
but
are
you
ready
for
a
straightforward
walk
off
to
church
before
all
the
world
none
of
your
private
chaplains
such
as
sir
guy
had
at
his
command
just
the
registrar
if
there
is
nothing
better
so
that
it
be
public
before
all
the
world
i
wish
we
could
start
this
instant
but
we
ca
can
we
no
dear
so
many
things
have
to
be
settled
and
what
have
you
settled
on
since
you
last
spoke
to
me
i
have
told
your
father
everything
yes
i
know
that
what
good
does
that
do
father
is
not
a
duke
of
omnium
no
one
supposed
that
he
would
object
but
he
did
said
silverbridge
yes
as
i
do
for
the
same
reason
because
he
would
not
have
his
daughter
creep
in
at
a
hole
but
to
your
own
father
you
have
not
ventured
to
speak
then
he
told
his
story
as
best
he
knew
how
it
was
not
that
he
feared
his
father
but
that
he
felt
that
the
present
moment
was
not
fit
he
wishes
you
to
marry
that
lady
mabel
grex
she
said
he
nodded
his
head
and
you
will
marry
her
never
i
might
have
done
so
had
i
not
seen
you
i
should
have
done
so
if
she
had
been
willing
but
now
i
never
can
never
never
her
hand
had
dropped
from
his
arm
but
now
she
put
it
up
again
for
a
moment
so
that
he
might
feel
the
pressure
of
her
fingers
say
that
you
believe
me
i
think
i
do
you
know
i
love
you
i
think
you
do
i
am
sure
i
hope
you
do
if
you
do
then
i
am
a
miserable
wretch
with
all
my
heart
i
do
then
i
am
as
proud
as
a
queen
you
will
tell
him
soon
as
soon
as
you
are
gone
as
soon
as
we
are
alone
together
i
will
and
then
i
will
follow
you
to
london
now
shall
we
not
say
my
own
she
whispered
you
will
let
me
have
one
kiss
her
hand
was
in
his
and
she
looked
about
as
though
to
see
that
no
eyes
were
watching
them
but
then
as
the
thoughts
came
rushing
to
her
mind
she
changed
her
purpose
no
she
said
what
is
it
but
a
trifle
it
is
nothing
in
itself
but
i
have
bound
myself
to
myself
by
certain
promises
and
you
must
not
ask
me
to
break
them
you
are
as
sweet
to
me
as
i
can
be
to
you
but
there
shall
be
no
kissing
till
i
know
that
i
shall
be
your
wife
now
take
me
back
chapter
liv
i
do
think
she
is
a
snake
on
the
following
day
tuesday
the
boncassens
went
and
then
there
were
none
of
the
guests
left
but
finn
and
lady
mabel
grex
with
of
course
miss
cassewary
the
duke
had
especially
asked
both
finn
and
lady
mabel
to
remain
the
former
through
his
anxiety
to
show
his
repentance
for
the
injustice
he
had
formerly
done
her
and
the
latter
in
the
hope
that
something
might
be
settled
as
soon
as
the
crowd
of
visitors
should
have
gone
he
had
never
spoken
quite
distinctly
to
mabel
he
had
felt
that
the
manner
in
which
he
had
learned
his
son
purpose
that
which
once
had
been
his
purpose
forbade
him
to
do
so
but
he
had
so
spoken
as
to
make
lady
mabel
quite
aware
of
his
wish
he
would
not
have
told
her
how
sure
he
was
that
silverbridge
would
keep
no
more
racehorses
how
he
trusted
that
silverbridge
had
done
with
betting
how
he
believed
that
the
young
member
would
take
a
real
interest
in
the
house
of
commons
had
he
not
intended
that
she
should
take
a
special
interest
in
the
young
man
and
then
he
had
spoken
about
the
house
in
london
it
was
to
be
made
over
to
silverbridge
as
soon
as
silverbridge
should
marry
and
there
was
gatherum
castle
gatherum
was
rather
a
trouble
than
otherwise
he
had
ever
felt
it
to
be
so
but
had
nevertheless
always
kept
it
open
perhaps
for
a
month
in
the
year
his
uncle
had
always
resided
there
for
a
fortnight
at
christmas
when
silverbridge
was
married
it
would
become
the
young
man
duty
to
do
something
of
the
same
kind
gatherum
was
the
white
elephant
of
the
family
and
silverbridge
must
enter
in
upon
his
share
of
the
trouble
he
did
not
know
that
in
saying
all
this
he
was
offering
his
son
as
a
husband
to
lady
mabel
but
she
understood
it
as
thoroughly
as
though
he
had
spoken
the
words
but
she
knew
the
son
mind
also
he
had
indeed
himself
told
her
all
his
mind
of
course
i
love
her
best
of
all
he
had
said
when
he
told
her
of
it
she
had
been
so
overcome
that
she
had
wept
in
her
despair
had
wept
in
his
presence
she
had
declared
to
him
her
secret
that
it
had
been
her
intention
to
become
his
wife
and
then
he
had
rejected
her
it
had
all
been
shame
and
sorrow
and
disappointment
to
her
and
she
could
not
but
remember
that
there
had
been
a
moment
when
she
might
have
secured
him
by
a
word
a
look
would
have
done
it
a
touch
of
her
finger
on
that
morning
she
had
known
then
that
he
had
intended
to
be
in
earnest
that
he
only
waited
for
encouragement
she
had
not
given
it
because
she
had
not
wished
to
grasp
too
eagerly
at
the
prize
and
now
the
prize
was
gone
she
had
said
that
she
had
spared
him
but
then
she
could
afford
to
joke
thinking
that
he
would
surely
come
back
to
her
she
had
begun
her
world
with
so
fatal
a
mistake
when
she
was
quite
young
when
she
was
little
more
than
a
child
but
still
not
a
child
she
had
given
all
her
love
to
a
man
whom
she
soon
found
that
it
would
be
impossible
she
should
ever
marry
he
had
offered
to
face
the
world
with
her
promising
to
do
the
best
to
smooth
the
rough
places
and
to
soften
the
stones
for
her
feet
but
she
young
as
she
was
had
felt
that
both
he
and
she
belonged
to
a
class
which
could
hardly
endure
poverty
with
contentment
the
grinding
need
for
money
the
absolute
necessity
of
luxurious
living
had
been
pressed
upon
her
from
her
childhood
she
had
seen
it
and
acknowledged
it
and
had
told
him
with
precocious
wisdom
that
that
which
he
offered
to
do
for
her
sake
would
be
a
folly
for
them
both
she
had
not
stinted
the
assurance
of
her
love
but
had
told
him
that
they
must
both
turn
aside
and
learn
to
love
elsewhere
he
had
done
so
with
too
complete
readiness
she
had
dreamed
of
a
second
love
which
should
obliterate
the
first
which
might
still
leave
to
her
the
memory
of
the
romance
of
her
early
passion
then
this
boy
had
come
in
her
way
with
him
all
her
ambition
might
have
been
satisfied
she
desired
high
rank
and
great
wealth
with
him
she
might
have
had
it
all
and
then
too
though
there
would
always
be
the
memory
of
that
early
passion
yet
she
could
in
another
fashion
love
this
youth
he
was
pleasant
to
her
and
gracious
and
she
had
told
herself
that
if
it
should
be
so
that
this
great
fortune
might
be
hers
she
would
atone
to
him
fully
for
that
past
romance
by
the
devotion
of
her
life
the
cup
had
come
within
the
reach
of
her
fingers
but
she
had
not
grasped
it
her
happiness
her
triumphs
her
great
success
had
been
there
present
to
her
and
she
had
dallied
with
her
fortune
there
had
been
a
day
on
which
he
had
been
all
but
at
her
feet
and
on
the
next
he
had
been
prostrate
at
the
feet
of
another
he
had
even
dared
to
tell
her
so
saying
of
that
american
that
of
course
he
loved
her
the
best
over
and
over
again
since
that
she
had
asked
herself
whether
there
was
no
chance
though
he
had
loved
that
other
one
best
she
would
take
him
if
it
were
possible
when
the
invitation
came
from
the
duke
she
would
not
lose
a
chance
she
had
told
him
that
it
was
impossible
that
he
the
heir
to
the
duke
of
omnium
should
marry
an
american
all
his
family
all
his
friends
all
his
world
would
be
against
him
and
then
he
was
so
young
and
as
she
thought
so
easily
led
he
was
lovable
and
prone
to
love
but
surely
his
love
could
not
be
very
strong
or
he
would
not
have
changed
so
easily
she
did
not
hesitate
to
own
to
herself
that
this
american
was
very
lovely
she
too
herself
was
beautiful
she
too
had
a
reputation
for
grace
loveliness
and
feminine
charm
she
knew
all
that
but
she
knew
also
that
her
attractions
were
not
so
bright
as
those
of
her
rival
she
could
not
smile
or
laugh
and
throw
sparks
of
brilliance
around
her
as
did
the
american
girl
miss
boncassen
could
be
graceful
as
a
nymph
in
doing
the
awkwardest
thing
when
she
had
pretended
to
walk
stiffly
along
to
some
imaginary
marriage
ceremony
with
her
foot
stuck
out
before
her
with
her
chin
in
the
air
and
one
arm
akimbo
silverbridge
had
been
all
afire
with
admiration
lady
mabel
understood
it
all
the
american
girl
must
be
taken
away
from
out
of
the
reach
of
the
young
man
senses
and
then
the
struggle
must
be
made
lady
mabel
had
not
been
long
at
matching
before
she
learned
that
she
had
much
in
her
favour
she
perceived
that
the
duke
himself
had
no
suspicion
of
what
was
going
on
and
that
he
was
strongly
disposed
in
her
favour
she
unravelled
it
all
in
her
own
mind
there
must
have
been
some
agreement
between
the
father
and
the
son
when
the
son
had
all
but
made
his
offer
to
her
more
than
once
she
was
to
speak
openly
to
the
duke
to
tell
him
all
that
silverbridge
had
said
to
her
and
all
that
he
had
not
said
and
to
ask
the
father
help
in
scheming
against
that
rival
but
she
could
not
find
the
words
with
which
to
begin
and
then
might
he
not
despise
her
and
despising
her
reject
her
were
she
to
declare
her
desire
to
marry
a
man
who
had
given
his
heart
to
another
woman
and
so
when
the
duke
asked
her
to
remain
after
the
departure
of
the
other
guests
she
decided
that
it
would
be
best
to
bide
her
time
the
duke
as
she
assented
kissed
her
hand
and
she
knew
that
this
sign
of
grace
was
given
to
his
intended
in
all
this
she
her
thoughts
and
her
prospects
to
her
old
friend
miss
cassewary
that
girl
has
gone
at
last
she
said
to
miss
cass
i
fear
she
has
left
her
spells
behind
her
my
dear
of
course
she
has
the
venom
out
of
the
snake
tooth
will
poison
all
the
blood
but
still
the
poor
bitten
wretch
does
not
always
die
i
do
think
she
is
a
snake
do
be
moral
cass
she
is
a
snake
in
my
sense
she
has
got
her
weapons
and
of
course
it
is
natural
enough
that
she
should
use
them
if
i
want
to
be
duchess
of
omnium
why
should
she
i
hate
to
hear
you
talk
of
yourself
in
that
way
because
you
have
enough
of
the
old
school
about
you
to
like
conventional
falsehood
this
young
man
did
in
fact
ask
me
to
be
his
wife
of
course
i
meant
to
accept
him
but
i
did
then
comes
this
convict
granddaughter
not
a
convict
you
know
what
i
mean
had
he
been
a
convict
it
would
have
been
all
the
same
i
take
upon
myself
to
say
that
had
the
world
been
informed
that
an
alliance
had
been
arranged
between
the
eldest
son
of
the
duke
of
omnium
and
the
daughter
of
earl
grex
the
world
would
have
been
satisfied
every
unmarried
daughter
of
every
peer
in
england
would
have
envied
me
but
it
would
have
been
comme
il
faut
certainly
my
dear
but
what
would
be
the
feeling
as
to
the
convict
granddaughter
you
do
suppose
that
i
would
approve
it
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
these
days
young
men
do
just
what
they
please
he
shall
do
what
he
pleases
but
he
must
be
made
to
be
pleased
with
me
so
much
she
said
to
miss
cassewary
but
she
did
not
divulge
any
plan
the
boncassens
had
just
gone
off
to
the
station
and
silverbridge
was
out
shooting
if
anything
could
be
done
here
at
matching
it
must
be
done
quickly
as
silverbridge
would
soon
take
his
departure
she
did
not
know
it
but
in
truth
he
was
remaining
in
order
that
he
might
as
he
said
have
all
this
out
with
the
governor
she
tried
to
realise
for
herself
some
plan
but
when
the
evening
came
nothing
was
fixed
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
just
as
the
sun
was
setting
the
duke
joined
her
in
the
gardens
and
spoke
to
her
more
plainly
than
he
had
ever
spoken
before
has
silverbridge
come
home
he
asked
i
have
not
seen
him
i
hope
you
and
mary
get
on
well
together
i
think
so
duke
i
am
sure
we
should
if
we
saw
more
of
each
other
i
sincerely
hope
you
may
there
is
nothing
i
wish
for
mary
so
much
as
that
she
should
have
a
sister
and
there
is
no
one
whom
i
would
be
so
glad
to
hear
her
call
by
that
name
as
yourself
how
could
he
have
spoken
plainer
the
ladies
were
all
together
in
the
when
silverbridge
came
bursting
in
rather
late
where
the
governor
he
asked
turning
to
his
sister
dressing
i
should
think
but
what
is
the
matter
i
want
to
see
him
i
must
be
off
to
cornwall
morning
to
cornwall
said
miss
cassewary
why
to
cornwall
asked
lady
mabel
but
mary
connecting
cornwall
with
frank
tregear
held
her
peace
i
ca
explain
it
all
now
but
i
must
start
very
early
then
he
went
off
to
his
father
study
and
finding
the
duke
still
there
explained
the
cause
of
his
intended
journey
the
member
for
polpenno
had
died
and
frank
tregear
had
been
invited
to
stand
for
the
borough
he
had
written
to
his
friend
to
ask
him
to
come
and
assist
in
the
struggle
years
ago
there
used
to
be
always
a
tregear
in
for
polpenno
said
silverbridge
but
he
is
a
younger
son
i
do
know
anything
about
it
said
silverbridge
but
as
he
has
asked
me
to
go
i
think
i
ought
to
do
it
the
duke
who
was
by
no
means
the
man
to
make
light
of
the
political
obligations
of
friendship
raised
no
objection
i
wish
said
he
that
something
could
have
been
arranged
between
you
and
mabel
before
you
went
the
young
man
stood
in
the
gloom
of
the
dark
room
aghast
this
was
certainly
not
the
moment
for
explaining
everything
to
his
father
i
have
set
my
heart
very
much
upon
it
and
you
ought
to
be
gratified
by
knowing
that
i
quite
approve
your
choice
all
that
had
been
years
ago
in
last
june
before
montacute
jones
before
that
day
in
the
rain
at
maidenhead
before
the
brightness
of
killancodlem
before
the
glories
of
miss
boncassen
had
been
revealed
to
him
there
is
no
time
for
that
kind
of
thing
now
he
said
weakly
i
thought
that
when
you
were
here
together
i
must
dress
now
sir
but
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
when
i
get
back
from
cornwall
i
will
come
back
direct
to
matching
and
will
explain
everything
so
he
escaped
it
was
clear
to
lady
mabel
that
there
was
no
opportunity
now
for
any
scheme
whatever
might
be
possible
must
be
postponed
till
after
this
cornish
business
had
been
completed
perhaps
it
might
be
better
so
she
had
thought
that
she
would
appeal
to
himself
that
she
would
tell
him
of
his
father
wishes
of
her
love
for
him
of
the
authority
which
he
had
once
given
her
for
loving
him
and
of
the
absolute
impossibility
of
his
marriage
with
the
american
she
thought
that
she
could
do
it
if
not
efficiently
at
any
rate
effectively
but
it
could
not
be
done
on
the
very
day
on
which
the
american
had
gone
it
came
out
in
the
course
of
the
evening
that
he
was
going
to
assist
frank
tregear
in
his
canvass
the
matter
was
not
spoken
of
openly
as
tregear
name
could
hardly
be
mentioned
but
everybody
knew
it
and
it
gave
occasion
to
mabel
for
a
few
words
apart
with
silverbridge
i
am
so
glad
you
are
going
to
him
she
said
in
a
little
whisper
of
course
i
go
when
he
wishes
me
i
do
know
that
i
can
do
him
any
good
the
greatest
good
in
the
world
your
name
will
go
so
far
it
will
be
everything
to
him
to
be
in
parliament
and
when
are
we
to
meet
again
she
said
i
shall
turn
up
somewhere
he
replied
as
he
gave
her
his
hand
to
wish
her
on
the
following
morning
the
duke
proposed
to
lady
mabel
that
she
should
stay
at
matching
for
yet
another
fortnight
or
even
for
a
month
if
it
might
be
possible
lady
mabel
whose
father
was
still
abroad
was
not
sorry
to
accept
the
invitation
chapter
lv
polpenno
polwenning
the
seat
of
tregear
frank
father
was
close
to
the
borough
of
polpenno
so
close
that
the
gates
of
the
grounds
opened
into
the
town
as
silverbridge
had
told
his
father
many
of
the
tregear
family
had
sat
for
the
borough
then
there
had
come
changes
and
strangers
had
made
themselves
welcome
by
their
money
when
the
vacancy
now
occurred
a
deputation
waited
upon
squire
tregear
and
asked
him
to
stand
the
deputation
would
guarantee
that
the
expense
should
not
exceed
a
certain
limited
sum
tregear
for
himself
had
no
such
ambition
his
eldest
son
was
abroad
and
was
not
at
all
such
a
man
as
one
would
choose
to
make
into
a
member
of
parliament
after
much
consideration
in
the
family
frank
was
invited
to
present
himself
to
the
constituency
frank
aspirations
in
regard
to
lady
mary
palliser
were
known
at
polwenning
and
it
was
thought
that
they
would
have
a
better
chance
of
success
if
he
could
write
the
letters
after
his
name
frank
acceded
and
as
he
was
starting
wrote
to
ask
the
assistance
of
his
friend
lord
silverbridge
at
that
time
there
were
only
nine
days
more
before
the
election
and
carbottle
the
liberal
candidate
was
already
living
in
great
style
at
the
camborne
arms
and
tregear
and
an
elder
sister
of
frank
who
quite
acknowledged
herself
to
be
an
old
maid
were
very
glad
to
welcome
frank
friend
on
the
first
morning
of
course
they
discussed
the
candidates
prospects
my
best
chance
of
success
said
frank
arises
from
the
fact
that
carbottle
is
fatter
than
the
people
here
seem
to
approve
if
his
purse
be
fat
said
old
tregear
that
will
carry
off
any
personal
defect
lord
silverbridge
asked
whether
the
candidate
was
not
too
fat
to
make
speeches
miss
tregear
declared
that
he
had
made
three
speeches
daily
for
the
last
week
and
that
williams
the
rector
who
had
heard
him
declared
him
to
be
a
godless
dissenter
tregear
thought
that
it
would
be
much
better
that
the
place
should
be
disfranchised
altogether
than
that
such
a
horrid
man
should
be
brought
into
the
neighbourhood
a
godless
dissenter
she
said
holding
up
her
hands
in
dismay
frank
thought
that
they
had
better
abstain
from
allusion
to
their
opponent
religion
then
tregear
made
a
little
speech
we
used
he
said
to
endeavour
to
get
someone
to
represent
us
in
parliament
who
would
agree
with
us
on
vital
subjects
such
as
the
church
of
england
and
the
necessity
of
religion
now
it
seems
to
be
considered
to
make
any
allusion
to
such
subjects
from
which
it
may
be
seen
that
this
old
tregear
was
very
conservative
indeed
when
the
old
people
were
gone
to
bed
the
two
young
men
discussed
the
matter
i
hope
you
get
in
said
silverbridge
and
if
i
can
do
anything
for
you
of
course
i
will
it
is
always
good
to
have
a
real
member
along
with
one
said
tregear
but
i
begin
to
think
i
am
a
very
shaky
conservative
myself
i
am
sorry
for
that
sir
timothy
is
such
a
beast
said
silverbridge
is
that
your
notion
of
a
political
opinion
are
you
to
be
this
or
that
in
accordance
with
your
own
liking
or
disliking
for
some
particular
man
one
is
supposed
to
have
opinions
of
one
own
your
father
would
be
down
on
a
man
because
he
is
a
dissenter
of
course
my
father
is
it
does
seem
so
hard
to
me
said
silverbridge
to
find
any
difference
between
the
two
sets
you
who
are
a
true
conservative
are
much
more
like
to
my
father
who
is
a
liberal
than
to
your
own
who
is
on
the
same
side
as
yourself
it
may
be
so
and
still
i
may
be
a
good
conservative
it
seems
to
me
in
the
house
to
mean
nothing
more
than
choosing
one
set
of
companions
or
choosing
another
there
are
some
awful
cads
who
sit
along
with
monk
fellows
that
make
you
sick
to
hear
them
and
whom
i
could
be
civil
to
but
i
do
think
there
is
anybody
i
hate
so
much
as
old
beeswax
he
has
a
contemptuous
way
with
his
nose
which
makes
me
long
to
pull
it
and
you
mean
to
go
over
in
order
that
you
may
be
justified
in
doing
so
i
think
i
soar
a
little
higher
said
tregear
oh
of
course
you
a
clever
fellow
said
silverbridge
not
without
a
touch
of
sarcasm
a
man
may
soar
higher
than
that
without
being
very
clever
if
the
party
that
calls
itself
liberal
were
to
have
all
its
own
way
who
is
there
that
does
believe
that
the
church
would
go
at
once
then
all
distinction
between
boroughs
the
house
of
lords
immediately
afterwards
and
after
that
the
crown
those
are
not
my
governor
ideas
your
governor
could
help
himself
a
liberal
party
with
plenipotentiary
power
must
go
on
right
away
to
the
logical
conclusion
of
its
arguments
it
is
only
the
conservative
feeling
of
the
country
which
saves
such
men
as
your
father
from
being
carried
headlong
to
ruin
by
their
own
machinery
you
have
read
french
revolution
yes
i
have
read
that
was
it
so
there
there
were
a
lot
of
honest
men
who
thought
they
could
do
a
deal
of
good
by
making
everybody
equal
a
good
many
were
made
equal
by
having
their
heads
cut
off
that
why
i
mean
to
be
member
for
polpenno
and
to
send
carbottle
back
to
london
carbottle
probably
does
want
to
cut
anybody
head
off
i
dare
say
he
as
conservative
as
anybody
but
he
wants
to
be
a
member
of
parliament
and
as
he
has
thought
much
about
anything
he
is
quite
willing
to
lend
a
hand
to
communism
radicalism
socialism
chopping
people
heads
off
or
anything
else
that
all
very
well
said
silverbridge
but
where
should
we
have
been
if
there
had
been
no
liberals
robespierre
and
his
pals
cut
off
a
lot
of
heads
but
louis
xiv
and
louis
xv
locked
up
more
in
prison
and
so
he
had
the
last
word
in
the
argument
the
whole
of
the
next
morning
was
spent
in
canvassing
and
the
whole
of
the
afternoon
in
the
evening
there
was
a
great
meeting
at
the
polwenning
assembly
room
which
at
the
present
moment
was
in
the
hands
of
the
conservative
party
here
frank
tregear
made
an
oration
in
which
he
declared
his
political
convictions
the
whole
speech
was
said
at
the
time
to
be
very
good
but
the
portion
of
it
which
was
apparently
esteemed
the
most
had
direct
reference
to
carbottle
who
was
carbottle
why
had
he
come
to
polpenno
who
had
sent
for
him
why
carbottle
rather
than
anybody
else
did
not
the
people
of
polpenno
think
that
it
might
be
as
well
to
send
carbottle
back
to
the
place
from
whence
he
had
come
these
questions
which
seemed
to
silverbridge
to
be
as
easy
as
they
were
attractive
almost
made
him
desirous
of
making
a
speech
himself
then
williams
the
rector
followed
a
gentleman
who
had
many
staunch
friends
and
many
bitter
enemies
in
the
town
he
addressed
himself
chiefly
to
that
bane
of
the
whole
country
as
he
conceived
them
the
godless
dissenters
and
was
felt
by
tregear
to
be
injuring
the
cause
by
every
word
he
spoke
it
was
necessary
that
williams
should
liberate
his
own
mind
and
therefore
he
persevered
with
the
godless
dissenters
at
great
length
not
explaining
however
how
a
man
who
thought
enough
about
his
religion
to
be
a
dissenter
could
be
godless
or
how
a
godless
man
should
care
enough
about
religion
to
be
a
dissenter
williams
was
heard
with
impatience
and
then
there
was
a
clamour
for
the
young
lord
he
was
the
son
of
an
minister
and
therefore
of
course
he
could
speak
he
was
himself
a
member
of
parliament
and
therefore
could
speak
he
had
boldly
severed
himself
from
the
faulty
political
tenets
of
his
family
and
therefore
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
was
peculiarly
entitled
to
speak
when
a
man
goes
electioneering
he
must
speak
at
a
to
refuse
is
possible
or
in
any
assembly
convened
for
a
purpose
a
gentleman
may
declare
that
he
is
not
prepared
for
the
occasion
but
in
such
an
emergency
as
this
a
man
and
a
member
of
parliament
can
not
plead
that
he
is
not
prepared
a
son
of
a
former
prime
minister
who
had
already
taken
so
strong
a
part
in
politics
as
to
have
severed
himself
from
his
father
not
prepared
to
address
the
voters
of
a
borough
whom
he
had
come
to
canvass
the
plea
was
so
absurd
that
he
was
thrust
on
to
his
feet
before
he
knew
what
he
was
about
it
was
in
truth
his
first
public
speech
at
silverbridge
he
had
attempted
to
repeat
a
few
words
and
in
his
failure
had
been
covered
by
the
sprugeons
and
the
sprouts
but
now
he
was
on
his
legs
in
a
great
room
in
an
unknown
town
with
all
the
aristocracy
of
the
place
before
him
his
eyes
at
first
swam
a
little
and
there
was
a
moment
in
which
he
thought
he
would
run
away
but
on
that
morning
as
he
was
dressing
there
had
come
to
his
mind
the
idea
of
the
possibility
of
such
a
moment
as
this
and
a
few
words
had
occurred
to
him
my
friend
frank
tregear
he
began
rushing
at
once
at
his
subject
is
a
very
good
fellow
and
i
hope
you
elect
him
then
he
paused
not
remembering
what
was
to
come
next
but
the
sentiment
which
he
had
uttered
appeared
to
his
auditors
to
be
so
good
in
itself
and
so
that
they
filled
up
a
long
pause
with
continued
clappings
and
exclamations
yes
continued
the
young
member
of
parliament
encouraged
by
the
kindness
of
the
crowd
i
have
known
frank
tregear
ever
so
long
and
i
do
think
you
could
find
a
better
member
of
parliament
anywhere
there
were
many
ladies
present
and
they
thought
that
the
duke
son
was
just
the
person
who
ought
to
come
electioneering
among
them
his
voice
was
much
pleasanter
to
their
ears
than
that
of
old
williams
the
women
waved
their
handkerchiefs
and
the
men
stamped
their
feet
here
was
an
orator
come
among
them
you
all
know
all
about
it
just
as
well
as
i
do
continued
the
orator
and
i
am
sure
you
feel
that
he
ought
to
be
member
for
polpenno
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
that
as
far
as
the
opinion
of
the
audience
went
there
ca
be
a
better
fellow
than
frank
tregear
and
i
ask
you
all
to
give
three
cheers
for
the
new
member
ten
times
three
cheers
were
given
and
the
carbottleites
outside
the
door
who
had
come
to
report
what
was
going
on
at
the
tregear
meeting
were
quite
of
opinion
that
this
eldest
son
of
the
former
prime
minister
was
a
tower
of
strength
i
do
know
anything
about
carbottle
continued
silverbridge
who
was
almost
growing
to
like
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
perhaps
he
a
good
fellow
too
no
no
no
a
very
bad
fellow
indeed
was
heard
from
different
parts
of
the
room
i
do
know
anything
about
him
i
was
at
school
with
carbottle
this
was
taken
as
a
stroke
of
the
keenest
wit
and
was
received
with
infinite
cheering
silverbridge
was
in
the
pride
of
his
youth
and
carbottle
was
sixty
at
the
least
nothing
could
have
been
funnier
he
seems
to
be
a
stout
old
party
but
i
do
think
he
the
man
for
polpenno
i
think
you
return
frank
tregear
i
was
at
school
with
him
and
i
tell
you
that
you
find
a
better
fellow
anywhere
than
frank
tregear
then
he
sat
down
and
i
am
afraid
he
felt
that
he
had
made
the
speech
of
the
evening
we
are
so
much
obliged
to
you
lord
silverbridge
miss
tregear
said
as
they
were
walking
home
together
that
just
the
sort
of
thing
that
the
people
like
so
reassuring
you
know
what
williams
says
about
the
dissenters
is
of
course
true
but
it
is
reassuring
i
hope
i
did
make
a
fool
of
myself
silverbridge
said
when
he
was
alone
with
tregear
probably
with
some
little
pride
in
his
heart
i
ought
to
say
that
you
did
seeing
that
you
praised
me
so
violently
but
whatever
it
was
it
was
well
taken
i
do
know
whether
they
will
elect
me
but
had
you
come
down
as
a
candidate
i
am
quite
sure
they
would
have
elected
you
silverbridge
was
hardly
satisfied
with
this
he
wished
to
have
been
told
that
he
had
spoken
well
he
did
not
however
resent
his
friend
coldness
perhaps
after
all
i
did
make
a
fool
of
myself
he
said
to
himself
as
he
went
to
bed
on
the
next
day
after
breakfast
it
was
found
to
be
raining
heavily
canvassing
was
of
course
the
business
of
the
hour
and
canvassing
is
a
business
which
can
not
be
done
indoors
it
was
soon
decided
that
the
rain
should
go
for
nothing
could
an
agreement
have
been
come
to
with
the
carbottleites
it
might
have
been
decided
that
both
parties
should
abstain
but
as
that
was
impossible
the
tregear
party
could
not
afford
to
lose
the
day
as
carbottle
by
reason
of
his
fatness
and
natural
slowness
would
perhaps
be
specially
averse
to
walking
about
in
the
slush
and
mud
it
might
be
that
they
would
gain
something
so
after
breakfast
they
started
with
umbrellas
tregear
silverbridge
newcomb
the
curate
pinebott
the
conservative
attorney
with
four
or
five
followers
who
were
armed
with
books
and
pencils
and
who
ticked
off
on
the
list
of
the
voters
the
names
of
the
friendly
the
doubtful
and
the
inimical
parliamentary
canvassing
is
not
a
pleasant
occupation
perhaps
nothing
more
disagreeable
more
squalid
more
revolting
to
the
senses
more
opposed
to
personal
dignity
can
be
conceived
the
same
words
have
to
be
repeated
over
and
over
again
in
the
cottages
hovels
and
lodgings
of
poor
men
and
women
who
only
understand
that
the
time
has
come
round
in
which
they
are
to
be
flattered
instead
of
being
the
flatterers
i
think
i
am
right
in
supposing
that
your
husband
principles
are
conservative
mrs
bubbs
i
do
know
nothing
about
it
you
better
call
again
and
see
bubbs
hissel
certainly
i
will
do
so
i
should
at
all
like
to
leave
the
borough
without
seeing
bubbs
i
hope
we
shall
have
your
influence
mrs
bubbs
i
do
know
nothing
about
it
my
folk
at
home
allays
vote
buff
and
i
think
bubbs
ought
to
go
buff
too
only
mind
this
bubbs
do
never
come
home
to
his
dinner
you
must
come
arter
six
and
i
hope
he
to
have
for
his
trouble
he
wo
have
my
word
to
vote
unless
he
have
such
is
the
conversation
in
which
the
candidate
takes
a
part
while
his
cortège
at
the
door
is
criticising
his
very
imperfect
mode
of
securing
bubbs
good
wishes
then
he
goes
on
to
the
next
house
and
the
same
thing
with
some
variation
is
endured
again
some
guide
philosopher
and
friend
who
accompanies
him
and
who
is
the
chief
of
the
cortège
has
calculated
on
his
behalf
that
he
ought
to
make
twenty
such
visitations
an
hour
and
to
call
on
two
hundred
constituents
in
the
course
of
the
day
as
he
is
always
falling
behind
in
his
number
he
is
always
being
driven
on
by
his
philosopher
till
he
comes
to
hate
the
poor
creatures
to
whom
he
is
forced
to
address
himself
with
a
most
cordial
hatred
it
is
a
nuisance
to
which
no
man
should
subject
himself
in
any
weather
but
when
it
rains
there
is
superadded
a
squalor
and
an
ill
humour
to
all
the
party
which
makes
it
almost
impossible
for
them
not
to
quarrel
before
the
day
is
over
to
talk
politics
to
bubbs
under
any
circumstances
is
bad
but
to
do
so
with
the
conviction
that
the
moisture
is
penetrating
from
your
greatcoat
through
your
shirt
to
your
bones
and
that
while
so
employed
you
are
breathing
the
steam
from
those
seven
other
wet
men
at
the
door
is
abominable
to
have
to
go
through
this
is
enough
to
take
away
all
the
pride
which
a
man
might
otherwise
take
from
becoming
a
member
of
parliament
but
to
go
through
it
and
then
not
to
become
a
member
is
base
indeed
to
go
through
it
and
to
feel
that
you
are
probably
paying
at
the
rate
of
a
hundred
pounds
a
day
for
the
privilege
is
most
disheartening
silverbridge
as
he
backed
up
tregear
in
the
uncomfortable
work
congratulated
himself
on
the
comfort
of
having
a
sprugeon
and
a
sprout
who
could
manage
his
borough
for
him
without
a
contest
they
worked
on
that
day
all
the
morning
till
one
when
they
took
luncheon
all
reeking
with
wet
at
the
king
head
so
that
a
little
money
might
be
legitimately
spent
in
the
cause
then
at
two
they
sallied
out
again
vainly
endeavouring
to
make
their
twenty
calls
within
the
hour
about
four
when
it
was
beginning
to
be
dusk
they
were
very
tired
and
silverbridge
had
ventured
to
suggest
that
as
they
were
all
wet
through
and
as
there
was
to
be
another
meeting
in
the
assembly
room
that
night
and
as
nobody
in
that
part
of
the
town
seemed
to
be
at
home
they
might
perhaps
be
allowed
to
adjourn
for
the
present
he
was
thinking
how
nice
it
would
be
to
have
a
glass
of
hot
and
then
lounge
till
but
the
philosophers
received
the
proposition
with
stern
disdain
was
his
lordship
aware
that
carbottle
had
been
out
all
day
from
eight
in
the
morning
and
was
still
at
work
that
the
carbottleites
had
already
sent
for
lanterns
and
were
determined
to
go
on
till
eight
among
the
artisans
who
would
then
have
returned
from
their
work
when
a
man
had
put
his
hand
to
the
plough
the
philosophers
thought
that
that
man
should
complete
the
furrow
the
philosophers
view
had
just
carried
the
day
the
discussion
having
been
held
under
seven
or
eight
wet
umbrellas
at
the
corner
of
a
dirty
little
lane
leading
into
the
high
street
when
suddenly
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
carbottle
cortège
made
its
appearance
the
philosophers
at
once
informed
them
that
on
such
occasions
it
was
customary
that
the
rival
candidates
should
be
introduced
it
will
take
ten
minutes
said
the
philosophers
but
then
it
will
take
them
ten
minutes
too
upon
this
tregear
as
being
the
younger
of
the
two
crossed
over
the
road
and
the
introduction
was
made
there
was
something
comfortable
in
it
to
the
tregear
party
as
no
imagination
could
conceive
anything
more
wretched
than
the
appearance
of
carbottle
he
was
a
very
stout
man
of
sixty
and
seemed
to
be
almost
carried
along
by
his
companions
he
had
pulled
his
up
and
his
hat
down
till
very
little
of
his
face
was
visible
and
in
attempting
to
look
at
tregear
and
silverbridge
he
had
to
lift
up
his
chin
till
the
rain
ran
off
his
hat
on
to
his
nose
he
had
an
umbrella
in
one
hand
and
a
stick
in
the
other
and
was
wet
through
to
his
very
skin
what
were
his
own
feelings
can
not
be
told
but
his
philosophers
guides
and
friends
would
allow
him
no
rest
very
hard
work
tregear
he
said
shaking
his
head
very
hard
indeed
mr
carbottle
then
the
two
parties
went
on
each
their
own
way
without
another
word
chapter
lvi
the
news
is
sent
to
matching
there
were
nine
days
of
this
work
during
which
lord
silverbridge
became
very
popular
and
made
many
speeches
tregear
did
not
win
half
so
many
hearts
or
recommend
himself
so
thoroughly
to
the
political
predilections
of
the
borough
but
nevertheless
he
was
returned
it
would
probably
be
unjust
to
attribute
this
success
chiefly
to
the
young
lord
eloquence
it
certainly
was
not
due
to
the
strong
religious
feelings
of
the
rector
it
is
to
be
feared
that
even
the
thoughtful
political
convictions
of
the
candidate
did
not
altogether
produce
the
result
it
was
that
chief
man
among
the
guides
and
friends
that
leading
philosopher
who
would
not
allow
anybody
to
go
home
from
the
rain
and
who
kept
his
eyes
so
sharply
open
to
the
pecuniary
doings
of
the
carbottleites
that
carbottle
guides
and
friends
had
hardly
dared
to
spend
a
shilling
it
was
he
who
had
in
truth
been
efficacious
in
every
attempt
they
had
made
to
spend
their
money
they
had
been
looked
into
and
circumvented
as
carbottle
had
been
brought
down
to
polpenno
on
purpose
that
he
might
spend
money
as
he
had
nothing
but
his
money
to
recommend
him
and
as
he
had
not
spent
it
the
free
and
independent
electors
of
the
borough
had
not
seen
their
way
to
vote
for
him
therefore
the
conservatives
were
very
elate
with
their
triumph
there
was
a
great
conservative
reaction
but
the
electioneering
guide
philosopher
and
friend
in
the
humble
retirement
of
his
own
home
he
was
a
tailor
in
the
town
whose
assistance
at
such
periods
had
long
been
in
requisition
he
knew
very
well
how
the
seat
had
been
secured
ten
shillings
a
head
would
have
sent
three
hundred
true
liberals
to
the
the
mode
of
distributing
the
money
had
been
arranged
but
the
conservative
tailor
had
been
too
acute
and
not
could
be
passed
the
tailor
got
pounds
for
his
work
and
that
was
smuggled
in
among
the
bills
for
printing
williams
however
was
sure
that
he
had
so
opened
out
the
iniquities
of
the
dissenters
as
to
have
convinced
the
borough
yes
every
salem
and
zion
and
ebenezer
in
his
large
parish
would
be
closed
it
is
a
great
thing
for
the
country
said
williams
he
make
a
capital
member
said
silverbridge
clapping
his
friend
on
the
back
i
hope
he
never
forget
said
williams
that
he
owes
his
seat
to
the
protestant
and
principles
which
have
sunk
so
deeply
into
the
minds
of
the
thoughtful
portion
of
the
inhabitants
of
this
borough
whom
should
they
elect
but
a
tregear
said
the
mother
feeling
that
her
rector
took
too
much
of
the
praise
to
himself
i
think
you
have
done
more
for
us
than
any
one
else
whispered
miss
tregear
to
the
young
lord
what
you
said
was
so
reassuring
the
father
before
he
went
to
bed
expressed
to
his
son
with
some
trepidation
a
hope
that
all
this
would
lead
to
no
great
permanent
increase
of
expenditure
that
evening
before
he
went
to
bed
lord
silverbridge
wrote
to
his
father
an
account
of
what
had
taken
place
at
polpenno
polwenning
december
my
dear
father
among
us
all
we
have
managed
to
return
tregear
i
am
afraid
you
will
not
be
quite
pleased
because
it
will
be
a
vote
lost
to
your
party
but
i
really
think
that
he
is
just
the
fellow
to
be
in
parliament
if
he
were
on
your
side
i
sure
he
the
kind
of
man
you
like
to
bring
into
office
he
is
always
thinking
about
those
sort
of
things
he
says
that
if
there
were
no
conservatives
such
liberals
as
you
and
monk
would
be
destroyed
by
the
jacobins
there
is
something
in
that
whether
a
man
is
a
conservative
or
not
himself
i
suppose
there
ought
to
be
conservatives
the
duke
as
he
read
this
made
a
memorandum
in
his
own
mind
that
he
would
explain
to
his
son
that
every
carriage
should
have
a
drag
to
its
wheels
but
that
an
ambitious
soul
would
choose
to
be
the
coachman
rather
than
the
drag
it
was
beastly
work
the
duke
made
another
memorandum
to
instruct
his
son
that
no
gentleman
above
the
age
of
a
schoolboy
should
allow
himself
to
use
such
a
word
in
such
a
sense
we
had
to
go
about
in
the
rain
up
to
our
knees
in
mud
for
eight
or
nine
days
always
saying
the
same
thing
and
of
course
all
that
we
said
was
bosh
another
memorandum
or
rather
two
one
as
to
the
slang
and
another
as
to
the
expediency
of
teaching
something
to
the
poor
voters
on
such
occasions
our
only
comfort
was
that
the
carbottle
people
were
quite
as
badly
off
as
us
another
memorandum
as
to
the
grammar
the
absence
of
christian
charity
did
not
at
the
moment
affect
the
duke
i
made
ever
so
many
speeches
till
at
last
it
seemed
to
be
quite
easy
here
there
was
a
very
grave
memorandum
speeches
easy
to
young
speakers
are
generally
very
difficult
to
old
listeners
but
of
course
it
was
all
bosh
this
required
no
separate
memorandum
i
have
promised
to
go
up
to
town
with
tregear
for
a
day
or
two
after
that
i
will
stick
to
my
purpose
of
going
to
matching
again
i
will
be
there
about
the
and
will
then
stay
over
christmas
after
that
i
am
going
into
the
brake
country
for
some
hunting
it
is
such
a
shame
to
have
a
lot
of
horses
and
never
to
ride
them
your
most
affectionate
son
silverbridge
the
last
sentence
gave
rise
in
the
duke
mind
to
the
necessity
of
a
very
elaborate
memorandum
on
the
subject
of
amusements
generally
by
the
same
post
another
letter
went
from
polpenno
to
matching
which
also
gave
rise
to
some
mental
memoranda
it
was
as
follows
my
dear
mabel
i
am
a
member
of
the
british
house
of
commons
i
have
sometimes
regarded
myself
as
being
one
of
the
most
peculiarly
unfortunate
men
in
the
world
and
yet
now
i
have
achieved
that
which
all
commoners
in
england
think
to
be
the
greatest
honour
within
their
reach
and
have
done
so
at
an
age
at
which
very
few
achieve
it
but
the
sons
of
the
wealthy
and
the
powerful
i
now
come
to
my
misfortunes
i
know
that
as
a
poor
man
i
ought
not
to
be
a
member
of
parliament
i
ought
to
be
earning
my
bread
as
a
lawyer
or
a
doctor
i
have
no
business
to
be
what
i
am
and
when
i
am
forty
i
shall
find
that
i
have
eaten
up
all
my
good
things
instead
of
having
them
to
eat
i
have
one
chance
before
me
you
know
very
well
what
that
is
tell
her
that
my
pride
in
being
a
member
of
parliament
is
much
more
on
her
behalf
than
on
my
own
the
man
who
dares
to
love
her
ought
at
any
rate
to
be
something
in
the
world
if
it
might
be
if
ever
it
may
be
i
should
wish
to
be
something
for
her
sake
i
am
sure
you
will
be
glad
of
my
success
yourself
for
my
own
sake
your
affectionate
friend
and
cousin
francis
tregear
the
first
mental
memorandum
in
regard
to
this
came
from
the
assertion
that
he
at
forty
would
have
eaten
up
all
his
good
things
no
he
being
a
man
might
make
his
way
to
good
things
though
he
was
not
born
to
them
he
surely
would
win
his
good
things
for
himself
but
what
good
things
were
in
store
for
her
what
chance
of
success
was
there
for
her
but
the
reflection
which
was
the
most
bitter
to
her
of
all
came
from
her
assurance
that
his
love
for
that
other
girl
was
so
genuine
even
when
he
was
writing
to
her
there
was
no
spark
left
of
the
old
romance
some
hint
of
a
recollection
of
past
feelings
some
reference
to
the
former
passion
might
have
been
allowed
to
him
she
as
a
woman
as
a
woman
all
whose
fortune
must
depend
on
marriage
could
indulge
in
no
such
allusions
but
surely
he
need
not
have
been
so
hard
but
still
there
was
another
memorandum
at
the
present
moment
she
would
do
all
that
he
desired
as
far
as
it
was
in
her
power
she
was
anxious
that
he
should
marry
lady
mary
palliser
though
so
anxious
also
that
something
of
his
love
should
remain
with
herself
she
was
quite
willing
to
convey
that
message
if
it
might
be
done
without
offence
to
the
duke
she
was
there
with
the
object
of
ingratiating
herself
with
the
duke
she
must
not
impede
her
favour
with
the
duke
by
making
herself
the
medium
of
any
secret
communications
between
mary
and
her
lover
but
how
should
she
serve
tregear
without
risk
of
offending
the
duke
she
read
the
letter
again
and
again
and
thinking
it
to
be
a
good
letter
she
determined
to
show
it
to
the
duke
tregear
has
got
in
at
polpenno
she
said
on
the
day
on
which
she
and
the
duke
had
received
their
letters
so
i
hear
from
silverbridge
it
will
be
a
good
thing
for
him
i
suppose
i
do
not
know
said
the
duke
coldly
he
is
my
cousin
and
i
have
always
been
interested
in
his
welfare
that
is
natural
and
a
seat
in
parliament
will
give
him
something
to
do
certainly
it
ought
said
the
duke
i
do
not
think
that
he
is
an
idle
man
to
this
the
duke
made
no
answer
he
did
not
wish
to
be
made
to
talk
about
tregear
may
i
tell
you
why
i
say
all
this
she
asked
softly
pressing
her
hand
on
the
duke
arm
ever
so
gently
to
this
the
duke
assented
but
still
coldly
because
i
want
to
know
what
i
ought
to
do
would
you
mind
reading
that
letter
of
course
you
will
remember
that
frank
and
i
have
been
brought
up
almost
as
brother
and
sister
the
duke
took
the
letter
in
his
hand
and
did
read
it
very
slowly
what
he
says
about
young
men
without
means
going
into
parliament
is
true
enough
this
was
not
encouraging
but
as
the
duke
went
on
reading
mabel
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
argue
the
matter
he
had
to
read
the
last
paragraph
twice
before
he
understood
it
he
did
read
it
twice
and
then
folding
the
letter
very
slowly
gave
it
back
to
his
companion
what
ought
i
to
do
asked
lady
mabel
as
you
and
i
my
dear
are
friends
i
think
that
any
carrying
of
a
message
to
mary
would
be
breaking
confidence
i
think
that
you
should
not
speak
to
mary
about
mr
tregear
then
he
changed
the
subject
lady
mabel
of
course
understood
that
after
that
she
could
not
say
a
word
to
mary
about
the
election
at
polpenno
chapter
lvii
the
meeting
at
the
bobtailed
fox
it
was
now
the
middle
of
december
and
matters
were
not
comfortable
in
the
runnymede
country
the
major
with
much
pluck
had
carried
on
his
operations
in
opposition
to
the
wishes
of
the
resident
members
of
the
hunt
the
owners
of
coverts
had
protested
and
farmers
had
sworn
that
he
should
not
ride
over
their
lands
there
had
even
been
some
talk
among
the
younger
men
of
thrashing
him
if
he
persevered
but
he
did
persevere
and
had
managed
to
have
one
or
two
good
runs
now
it
was
the
fortune
of
the
runnymede
hunt
that
many
of
those
who
rode
with
the
hounds
were
strangers
to
the
country
men
who
came
down
by
train
from
london
gentlemen
of
perhaps
no
great
distinction
who
could
ride
hard
but
as
to
whom
it
was
thought
that
as
they
did
not
provide
the
land
to
ride
over
or
the
fences
to
be
destroyed
or
the
coverts
for
the
foxes
or
the
greater
part
of
the
subscription
they
ought
not
to
oppose
those
by
whom
all
these
things
were
supplied
but
the
major
knowing
where
his
strength
lay
had
managed
to
get
a
party
to
support
him
the
contract
to
hunt
the
country
had
been
made
with
him
in
last
march
and
was
good
for
one
year
having
the
kennels
and
the
hounds
under
his
command
he
did
hunt
the
country
but
he
did
so
amidst
a
storm
of
contumely
and
ill
will
at
last
it
was
decided
that
a
general
meeting
of
the
members
of
the
hunt
should
be
called
together
with
the
express
object
of
getting
rid
of
the
major
the
gentlemen
of
the
neighbourhood
felt
that
the
major
was
not
to
be
borne
and
the
farmers
were
very
much
stronger
against
him
than
the
gentlemen
it
had
now
become
a
settled
belief
among
sporting
men
in
england
that
the
major
had
with
his
own
hands
driven
the
nail
into
the
horse
foot
was
it
to
be
endured
that
the
runnymede
farmers
should
ride
to
hounds
under
a
master
who
had
been
guilty
of
such
an
iniquity
as
that
the
staines
and
egham
gazette
which
had
always
supported
the
runnymede
hunt
declared
in
very
plain
terms
that
all
who
rode
with
the
major
were
enjoying
their
sport
out
of
the
plunder
which
had
been
extracted
from
lord
silverbridge
then
a
meeting
was
called
for
saturday
the
december
to
be
held
at
that
sporting
little
inn
the
bobtailed
fox
the
members
of
the
hunt
were
earnestly
called
upon
to
attend
it
was
so
said
the
printed
document
which
was
issued
the
only
means
by
which
the
hunt
could
be
preserved
if
gentlemen
who
were
interested
did
not
put
their
shoulders
to
the
wheel
the
runnymede
hunt
must
be
regarded
as
a
thing
of
the
past
one
of
the
documents
was
sent
to
the
major
with
an
intimation
that
if
he
wished
to
attend
no
objection
would
be
made
to
his
presence
the
chair
would
be
taken
at
twelve
punctually
by
that
popular
and
old
sportsman
mahogany
topps
was
ever
the
master
of
a
hunt
treated
in
such
a
way
his
presence
not
objected
to
as
a
rule
the
master
of
a
hunt
does
not
attend
hunt
meetings
because
the
matter
to
be
discussed
is
generally
that
of
the
money
to
be
subscribed
for
him
as
to
which
it
is
as
well
he
should
not
hear
the
pros
and
cons
but
it
is
presumed
that
he
is
to
be
the
hero
of
the
hour
and
that
he
is
to
be
treated
to
his
face
and
spoken
of
behind
his
back
with
love
admiration
and
respect
but
now
this
master
was
told
his
presence
would
be
allowed
and
then
this
meeting
was
summoned
for
twelve
on
a
when
as
all
the
world
knew
the
hounds
were
to
meet
at
eleven
twelve
miles
off
was
ever
anything
so
base
said
the
major
to
himself
but
he
resolved
that
he
would
be
equal
to
the
occasion
he
immediately
issued
cards
to
all
the
members
stating
that
on
that
day
the
meet
had
been
changed
from
croppingham
bushes
which
was
ever
so
much
on
the
other
side
of
bagshot
to
the
bobtailed
fox
for
the
benefit
of
the
hunt
at
large
said
the
card
and
that
the
hounds
would
be
there
at
one
whatever
might
happen
he
must
show
a
spirit
in
all
this
there
were
one
or
two
of
the
london
brigade
who
stood
fast
to
him
cock
your
tail
tifto
said
one
supporter
and
show
you
are
afraid
of
nothing
so
tifto
cocked
his
tail
and
went
to
the
meeting
in
his
best
new
scarlet
coat
with
his
whitest
breeches
his
pinkest
boots
and
his
neatest
little
bows
at
his
knees
he
entered
the
room
with
his
horn
in
his
hand
as
a
symbol
of
authority
and
took
off
his
to
salute
the
assembly
with
a
jaunty
air
he
had
taken
two
glasses
of
cherry
brandy
and
as
long
as
the
stimulant
lasted
would
no
doubt
be
able
to
support
himself
with
audacity
old
topps
in
rising
from
his
chair
did
not
say
very
much
he
had
been
hunting
in
the
runnymede
country
for
nearly
fifty
years
and
had
never
seen
anything
so
sad
as
this
before
it
made
him
he
knew
very
unhappy
as
for
foxes
there
were
always
plenty
of
foxes
in
his
coverts
his
friend
jawstock
on
the
right
would
explain
what
all
this
was
about
all
he
wanted
was
to
see
the
runnymede
hunt
properly
kept
up
then
he
sat
down
and
jawstock
rose
to
his
legs
jawstock
was
a
gentleman
well
known
in
the
runnymede
country
who
had
himself
been
instrumental
in
bringing
major
tifto
into
these
parts
there
is
often
someone
in
a
hunting
country
who
never
becomes
a
master
of
hounds
himself
but
who
has
almost
as
much
to
say
about
the
business
as
the
master
himself
sometimes
at
hunt
meetings
he
is
rather
unpopular
as
he
is
always
inclined
to
talk
but
there
are
occasions
on
which
his
services
are
felt
to
be
valuable
as
were
jawstock
at
present
he
was
about
years
of
age
was
not
much
given
to
riding
owned
no
coverts
himself
and
was
not
a
man
of
wealth
but
he
understood
the
nature
of
hunting
knew
all
its
laws
and
was
a
judge
of
horses
of
hounds
and
of
men
and
could
say
a
thing
when
he
had
to
say
it
jawstock
sat
on
the
right
hand
of
topps
and
a
place
was
left
for
the
master
opposite
the
task
to
be
performed
was
neither
easy
nor
pleasant
it
was
necessary
that
the
orator
should
accuse
the
gentleman
opposite
to
him
a
man
with
whom
he
himself
had
been
very
intimate
of
iniquity
so
gross
and
so
mean
that
nothing
worse
can
be
conceived
you
are
a
swindler
a
cheat
a
rascal
of
the
very
deepest
dye
a
rogue
so
mean
that
it
is
revolting
to
be
in
the
same
room
with
you
that
was
what
jawstock
had
to
say
and
he
said
it
looking
round
the
room
occasionally
appealing
to
topps
who
on
these
occasions
would
lift
up
his
hands
in
horror
but
never
letting
his
eye
fall
for
a
moment
on
the
major
jawstock
told
his
story
i
did
not
see
it
done
said
he
i
know
nothing
about
it
i
never
was
at
doncaster
in
my
life
but
you
have
evidence
of
what
the
jockey
club
thinks
the
master
of
our
hunt
has
been
banished
from
racecourses
here
there
was
considerable
opposition
and
a
few
short
but
excited
little
dialogues
were
maintained
throughout
all
which
tifto
restrained
himself
like
a
spartan
at
any
rate
he
has
been
thoroughly
disgraced
continued
jawstock
as
a
sporting
man
he
has
been
driven
out
of
the
beargarden
club
he
resigned
in
disgust
at
their
treatment
said
a
friend
of
the
major
then
let
him
resign
in
disgust
at
ours
said
jawstock
for
we
wo
have
him
here
cæsar
would
keep
a
wife
who
was
suspected
of
infidelity
nor
will
the
runnymede
country
endure
a
master
of
hounds
who
is
supposed
to
have
driven
a
nail
into
a
horse
foot
two
or
three
other
gentlemen
had
something
to
say
before
the
major
was
allowed
to
speak
the
upshot
of
the
discourse
of
all
of
them
being
the
same
the
major
must
go
then
the
major
got
up
and
certainly
as
far
as
attention
went
he
had
full
justice
done
him
however
clamorous
they
might
intend
to
be
afterwards
that
amount
of
fair
play
they
were
all
determined
to
afford
him
the
major
was
not
excellent
at
speaking
but
he
did
perhaps
better
than
might
have
been
expected
this
is
a
very
disagreeable
position
he
said
very
disagreeable
indeed
as
for
the
nail
in
the
horse
foot
i
know
no
more
about
it
than
the
babe
unborn
but
i
got
two
things
to
say
and
i
say
what
are
the
most
consequence
first
these
hounds
belong
to
me
here
he
paused
and
a
loud
contradiction
came
from
many
parts
of
the
room
jawstock
however
proposed
that
the
major
should
be
heard
to
the
end
i
say
they
belong
to
me
repeated
the
major
if
anybody
tries
his
hand
at
anything
else
the
law
will
soon
set
that
to
rights
but
that
are
of
much
consequence
what
i
got
to
say
is
this
let
the
matter
be
referred
if
that
had
a
nail
run
into
his
foot
and
i
do
say
he
had
who
was
the
man
most
injured
why
lord
silverbridge
everybody
knows
that
i
suppose
he
dropped
well
on
to
eighty
thousand
pounds
i
propose
to
leave
it
to
him
let
him
say
he
ought
to
know
more
about
it
than
any
one
he
and
i
were
partners
in
the
horse
his
lordship
are
very
sweet
upon
me
just
at
present
nobody
need
fear
that
he
do
me
a
good
turn
i
say
leave
it
to
him
in
this
matter
the
major
had
certainly
been
well
advised
a
rumour
had
become
prevalent
among
sporting
circles
that
silverbridge
had
refused
to
condemn
the
major
it
was
known
that
he
had
paid
his
bets
without
delay
and
that
he
had
to
some
extent
declined
to
take
advice
from
the
leaders
of
the
jockey
club
the
major
friends
were
informed
that
the
young
lord
had
refused
to
vote
against
him
at
the
club
was
it
not
more
than
probable
that
if
this
matter
were
referred
to
him
he
would
refuse
to
give
a
verdict
against
his
late
partner
the
major
sat
down
put
on
his
cap
and
folded
his
arms
akimbo
with
his
horn
sticking
out
from
his
left
hand
for
a
time
there
was
general
silence
broken
however
by
murmurs
in
different
parts
of
the
room
then
jawstock
whispered
something
into
the
ear
of
the
chairman
and
topps
rising
from
his
seat
suggested
to
tifto
that
he
should
retire
i
think
so
said
jawstock
the
proposition
you
have
made
can
be
discussed
only
in
your
absence
then
the
major
held
a
consultation
with
one
of
his
friends
and
after
that
did
retire
when
he
was
gone
the
real
hubbub
of
the
meeting
commenced
there
were
some
there
who
understood
the
nature
of
lord
silverbridge
feelings
in
the
matter
he
would
be
the
last
man
in
england
to
declare
him
guilty
said
jawstock
whatever
my
lord
says
he
sha
ride
across
my
land
said
a
farmer
in
the
background
i
do
think
any
gentleman
ever
made
a
fairer
proposition
since
anything
was
anything
said
a
friend
of
the
major
a
gentleman
who
kept
livery
stables
in
long
acre
we
wo
have
him
here
said
another
farmer
whereupon
topps
shook
his
head
sadly
i
do
think
any
gentleman
ought
to
be
condemned
without
a
said
one
of
tifto
admirers
and
where
you
to
get
any
one
to
hunt
the
country
like
him
i
do
know
as
any
body
is
prepared
to
say
we
manage
that
said
a
young
gentleman
from
the
neighbourhood
of
bagshot
who
thought
that
he
could
hunt
the
country
himself
quite
as
well
as
major
tifto
he
must
go
from
here
that
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
said
jawstock
put
it
to
the
vote
jawstock
said
the
keeper
topps
who
had
had
great
experience
in
public
meetings
hereupon
expressed
an
opinion
that
they
might
as
well
go
to
a
vote
no
doubt
he
was
right
if
the
matter
was
one
which
must
sooner
or
later
be
decided
in
that
manner
jawstock
looked
round
the
room
trying
to
calculate
what
might
be
the
effect
of
a
show
of
hands
the
majority
was
with
him
but
he
was
well
aware
that
of
this
majority
some
few
would
be
drawn
away
by
the
apparent
justice
of
tifto
proposition
and
what
was
the
use
of
voting
let
them
vote
as
they
might
it
was
out
of
the
question
that
tifto
should
remain
master
of
the
hunt
but
the
chairman
had
acceded
and
on
such
occasions
it
is
difficult
to
go
against
the
chairman
then
there
came
a
show
of
hands
first
for
those
who
desired
to
refer
the
matter
to
lord
silverbridge
and
afterwards
for
direct
enemies
for
those
who
were
anxious
to
banish
tifto
out
of
hand
without
reference
to
any
one
at
last
the
matter
was
settled
to
the
great
annoyance
of
jawstock
and
the
farmers
the
meeting
voted
that
lord
silverbridge
should
be
invited
to
give
his
opinion
as
to
the
innocence
or
guilt
of
his
late
partner
the
major
friends
carried
the
discussion
out
to
him
as
he
sat
on
horseback
as
though
he
had
altogether
gained
the
battle
and
was
secure
in
his
position
as
master
of
the
runnymede
hunt
for
the
next
dozen
years
but
at
the
same
time
there
came
a
message
from
mahogany
topps
it
was
now
two
and
topps
expressed
a
hope
that
major
tifto
would
not
draw
the
country
on
the
present
occasion
the
major
thinking
that
it
might
be
as
well
to
conciliate
his
enemies
rode
solemnly
and
slowly
home
to
tallyho
lodge
in
the
middle
of
his
hounds
chapter
lviii
the
major
is
deposed
when
silverbridge
undertook
to
return
with
tregear
to
london
instead
of
going
off
direct
to
matching
it
is
to
be
feared
that
he
was
simply
actuated
by
a
desire
to
postpone
his
further
visit
to
his
father
house
he
had
thought
that
lady
mabel
would
surely
be
gone
before
his
task
at
polpenno
was
completed
as
soon
as
he
should
again
find
himself
in
his
father
presence
he
would
at
once
declare
his
intention
of
marrying
isabel
boncassen
but
he
could
not
see
his
way
to
doing
it
while
lady
mabel
should
be
in
the
house
i
think
you
will
find
mabel
still
at
matching
said
tregear
on
their
way
up
she
will
wait
for
you
i
fancy
i
do
know
why
she
should
wait
for
me
said
silverbridge
almost
angrily
i
thought
that
you
and
she
were
fast
friends
i
suppose
we
are
after
a
fashion
she
might
wait
for
you
perhaps
i
think
she
would
if
i
could
go
there
you
are
much
thicker
with
her
than
i
ever
was
you
went
to
see
her
at
grex
when
nobody
else
was
there
is
miss
cassewary
nobody
next
door
to
it
said
silverbridge
half
jealous
of
the
favours
shown
to
tregear
i
thought
said
tregear
that
there
would
be
a
closer
intimacy
between
you
and
her
i
do
know
why
you
should
think
so
had
you
never
any
such
idea
yourself
i
have
any
now
so
there
may
be
an
end
of
it
i
do
think
a
fellow
ought
to
be
on
such
a
subject
then
i
am
very
sorry
for
mabel
said
tregear
this
was
uttered
solemnly
so
that
silverbridge
found
himself
debarred
from
making
any
flippant
answer
he
could
not
altogether
defend
himself
he
had
been
quite
justified
he
thought
in
changing
his
mind
but
he
did
not
like
to
own
that
he
had
changed
it
so
quickly
i
think
we
had
better
not
talk
any
more
about
it
he
said
after
pausing
for
a
few
moments
after
that
nothing
more
was
said
between
them
on
the
subject
up
in
town
silverbridge
spent
two
or
three
days
pleasantly
enough
while
a
thunderbolt
was
being
prepared
for
him
or
rather
in
truth
two
thunderbolts
during
these
days
he
was
much
with
tregear
and
though
he
could
not
speak
freely
of
his
own
matrimonial
projects
still
he
was
brought
round
to
give
some
sort
of
assent
to
the
engagement
between
tregear
and
his
sister
this
new
position
which
his
friend
had
won
for
himself
did
in
some
degree
operate
on
his
judgment
it
was
not
perhaps
that
he
himself
imagined
that
tregear
as
a
member
of
parliament
would
be
worthier
but
that
he
fancied
that
such
would
be
the
duke
feelings
the
duke
had
declared
that
tregear
was
nobody
that
could
hardly
be
said
of
a
man
who
had
a
seat
in
the
house
of
commons
certainly
could
not
be
said
by
so
staunch
a
politician
as
the
duke
but
had
he
known
of
those
two
thunderbolts
he
would
not
have
enjoyed
his
time
at
the
beargarden
the
thunderbolts
fell
upon
him
in
the
shape
of
two
letters
which
reached
his
hands
at
the
same
time
and
were
as
follows
the
bobtailed
fox
egham
december
my
lord
at
a
meeting
held
in
this
house
in
reference
to
the
hunting
of
the
runnymede
country
it
was
proposed
that
the
management
of
the
hounds
should
be
taken
out
of
the
hands
of
major
tifto
in
consequence
of
certain
conduct
of
which
it
is
alleged
that
he
was
guilty
at
the
last
doncaster
races
major
tifto
was
present
and
requested
that
your
lordship
opinion
should
be
asked
as
to
his
guilt
i
do
not
know
myself
that
we
are
warranted
in
troubling
your
lordship
on
the
subject
i
am
however
commissioned
by
the
majority
of
the
gentlemen
who
were
present
to
ask
you
whether
you
think
that
major
tifto
conduct
on
that
occasion
was
of
such
a
nature
as
to
make
him
unfit
to
be
the
depositary
of
that
influence
authority
and
intimacy
which
ought
to
be
at
the
command
of
a
master
of
hounds
i
feel
myself
bound
to
inform
your
lordship
that
the
hunt
generally
will
be
inclined
to
place
great
weight
upon
your
opinion
but
that
it
does
not
undertake
to
reinstate
major
tifto
even
should
your
opinion
be
in
his
favour
i
have
the
honour
to
be
my
lord
your
lordship
most
obedient
servant
jeremiah
jawstock
juniper
lodge
staines
jawstock
when
he
had
written
this
letter
was
proud
of
his
own
language
but
still
felt
that
the
application
was
a
very
lame
one
why
ask
any
man
for
an
opinion
and
tell
him
at
the
same
time
that
his
opinion
might
probably
not
be
taken
and
yet
no
other
alternative
had
been
left
to
him
the
meeting
had
decided
that
the
application
should
be
made
but
jawstock
was
well
aware
that
let
the
young
lord
answer
be
what
it
might
the
major
would
not
be
endured
as
master
in
the
runnymede
country
jawstock
felt
that
the
passage
in
which
he
explained
that
a
master
of
hounds
should
be
a
depositary
of
influence
and
intimacy
was
good
but
yet
the
application
was
lame
very
lame
lord
silverbridge
as
he
read
it
thought
that
it
was
very
unfair
it
was
a
most
disagreeable
thunderbolt
then
he
opened
the
second
letter
of
which
he
well
knew
the
handwriting
it
was
from
the
major
tifto
letters
were
very
legible
but
the
writing
was
cramped
showing
that
the
operation
had
been
performed
with
difficulty
silverbridge
had
hoped
that
he
might
never
receive
another
epistle
from
his
late
partner
the
letter
as
follows
had
been
drawn
out
for
tifto
in
rough
by
the
keeper
in
long
acre
my
dear
lord
silverbridge
i
venture
respectfully
to
appeal
to
your
lordship
for
an
act
of
justice
nobody
has
more
of
a
englishman
feeling
of
fair
play
between
man
and
man
than
your
lordship
and
as
you
and
me
have
been
a
good
deal
together
and
your
lordship
ought
to
know
me
pretty
well
i
venture
to
appeal
to
your
lordship
for
a
good
word
all
that
story
from
doncaster
has
got
down
into
the
country
where
i
am
nobody
could
have
been
more
sorry
than
me
that
your
lordship
dropped
your
money
would
not
i
have
been
prouder
than
anything
to
have
a
horse
in
my
name
win
the
race
was
it
likely
i
should
lame
him
anyways
i
did
and
i
do
think
your
lordship
thinks
it
was
me
of
course
your
lordship
and
me
is
two
now
but
that
do
alter
the
facts
what
i
want
is
your
lordship
to
send
me
a
line
just
stating
your
lordship
opinion
that
i
did
do
it
and
did
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
which
i
did
there
was
a
meeting
at
the
bobtailed
fox
yesterday
and
the
gentlemen
was
all
of
one
mind
to
go
by
what
your
lordship
would
say
i
could
desire
nothing
fairer
so
i
hope
your
lordship
will
stand
to
me
now
and
write
something
that
will
pull
me
through
with
all
respects
i
beg
to
remain
your
lordship
most
dutiful
servant
tifto
there
was
something
in
this
letter
which
the
major
himself
did
not
quite
approve
there
was
an
absence
of
familiarity
about
it
which
annoyed
him
he
would
have
liked
to
call
upon
his
late
partner
to
declare
that
a
more
honourable
man
than
major
tifto
had
never
been
known
on
the
turf
but
he
felt
himself
to
be
so
far
down
in
the
world
that
it
was
not
safe
for
him
to
hold
an
opinion
of
his
own
even
against
the
keeper
silverbridge
was
for
a
time
in
doubt
whether
he
should
answer
the
letters
at
all
and
if
so
how
he
should
answer
them
in
regard
to
jawstock
and
the
meeting
at
large
he
regarded
the
application
as
an
impertinence
but
as
to
tifto
himself
he
vacillated
much
between
pity
contempt
and
absolute
condemnation
everybody
had
assured
him
that
the
man
had
certainly
been
guilty
the
fact
that
he
had
made
bets
against
their
joint
horse
bets
as
to
which
he
had
said
nothing
till
after
the
race
was
over
had
been
admitted
by
himself
and
yet
it
was
possible
that
the
man
might
not
be
such
a
rascal
as
to
be
unfit
to
manage
the
runnymede
hounds
having
himself
got
rid
of
tifto
he
would
have
been
glad
that
the
poor
wretch
should
have
been
left
with
his
hunting
honours
but
he
did
not
think
that
he
could
write
to
his
late
partner
any
letter
that
would
preserve
those
honours
to
him
at
tregear
advice
he
referred
the
matter
to
lupton
lupton
was
of
opinion
that
both
the
letters
should
be
answered
but
that
the
answer
to
each
should
be
very
short
there
is
a
prejudice
about
the
world
just
at
present
said
lupton
in
favour
of
answering
letters
i
do
see
why
i
am
to
be
subjected
to
an
annoyance
because
another
man
has
taken
a
liberty
but
it
is
better
to
submit
to
public
opinion
public
opinion
thinks
that
letters
should
be
answered
then
lupton
dictated
the
answers
lord
silverbridge
presents
his
compliments
to
jawstock
and
begs
to
say
that
he
does
not
feel
himself
called
upon
to
express
any
opinion
as
to
major
tifto
conduct
at
doncaster
that
was
the
first
the
second
was
rather
less
simple
but
not
much
longer
sir
i
do
not
feel
myself
called
upon
to
express
any
opinion
either
to
you
or
to
others
as
to
your
conduct
at
doncaster
having
received
a
letter
on
the
subject
from
jawstock
i
have
written
to
him
to
this
effect
your
obedient
servant
silverbridge
to
tifto
tallyho
lodge
poor
tifto
when
he
got
this
very
curt
epistle
was
he
did
not
dare
to
show
it
day
after
day
he
told
the
keeper
that
he
had
received
no
reply
and
at
last
asserted
that
his
appeal
had
remained
altogether
unanswered
even
this
he
thought
was
better
than
acknowledging
the
rebuff
which
had
reached
him
as
regarded
the
meeting
which
had
been
held
and
any
further
meetings
which
might
be
held
at
the
bobtailed
fox
he
did
not
see
the
necessity
as
he
explained
to
the
keeper
of
acknowledging
that
he
had
written
any
letter
to
lord
silverbridge
the
letter
to
jawstock
was
of
course
brought
forward
another
meeting
at
the
bobtailed
fox
was
convened
but
in
the
meantime
hunting
had
been
discontinued
in
the
runnymede
country
the
major
with
all
his
pluck
with
infinite
cherry
brandy
could
not
do
it
men
who
had
a
few
weeks
since
been
on
very
friendly
terms
and
who
had
called
each
other
dick
and
harry
when
the
squabble
first
began
were
now
talking
of
punching
each
other
heads
special
whips
had
been
procured
by
men
who
intended
to
ride
and
special
bludgeons
by
the
young
farmers
who
intended
that
nobody
should
ride
as
long
as
major
tifto
kept
the
hounds
it
was
said
that
the
police
would
interfere
it
was
whispered
that
the
hounds
would
be
shot
though
topps
jawstock
and
others
declared
that
no
crime
so
heinous
as
that
had
ever
been
contemplated
in
the
runnymede
country
the
difficulties
were
too
many
for
poor
tifto
and
the
hounds
were
not
brought
out
again
under
his
influence
a
second
meeting
was
summoned
and
an
invitation
was
sent
to
the
major
similar
to
that
which
he
had
before
received
but
on
this
occasion
he
did
not
appear
nor
were
there
many
of
the
gentlemen
down
from
london
this
second
meeting
might
almost
have
been
called
select
mahogany
topps
was
there
of
course
in
the
chair
and
jawstock
took
the
place
of
honour
and
of
difficulty
on
his
right
hand
there
was
the
young
gentleman
from
bagshot
who
considered
himself
quite
fit
to
take
tifto
place
if
somebody
else
would
pay
the
bills
and
settle
the
money
and
there
was
the
sporting
old
parson
from
croppingham
three
or
four
other
members
of
the
hunt
were
present
and
perhaps
farmers
ready
to
declare
that
major
tifto
should
never
be
allowed
to
cross
their
fields
again
but
there
was
no
opposition
jawstock
read
the
young
lord
note
and
declared
that
it
was
quite
as
much
as
he
expected
he
considered
that
the
note
short
as
it
was
must
be
decisive
major
tifto
in
appealing
to
lord
silverbridge
had
agreed
to
abide
by
his
answer
and
that
answer
was
now
before
them
jawstock
ventured
to
propose
that
major
tifto
should
be
declared
to
be
no
longer
master
of
the
runnymede
hounds
the
parson
from
croppingham
seconded
the
proposition
and
major
tifto
was
formally
deposed
chapter
lix
no
one
can
tell
what
may
come
to
pass
then
lord
silverbridge
necessarily
went
down
to
matching
knowing
that
he
must
meet
mabel
grex
why
should
she
have
prolonged
her
visit
no
doubt
it
might
be
very
pleasant
for
her
to
be
his
guest
at
matching
but
she
had
been
there
above
a
month
he
could
understand
that
his
father
should
ask
her
to
remain
his
father
was
still
brooding
over
that
foolish
communication
which
had
been
made
to
him
on
the
night
of
the
dinner
at
the
beargarden
his
father
was
still
intending
to
take
mabel
to
his
arms
as
a
but
lady
mabel
herself
knew
that
it
could
not
be
so
the
whole
truth
had
been
told
to
her
why
should
she
remain
at
matching
for
the
sake
of
being
mixed
up
in
a
scene
the
acting
of
which
could
not
fail
to
be
disagreeable
to
her
he
found
the
house
very
quiet
and
nearly
empty
finn
was
there
with
the
two
girls
and
warburton
had
come
back
miss
cassewary
had
gone
to
a
brother
house
other
guests
to
make
christmas
merry
there
were
none
as
he
looked
round
at
the
large
rooms
he
reflected
that
he
himself
was
there
only
for
a
special
purpose
it
was
his
duty
to
break
the
news
of
his
intended
marriage
to
his
father
as
he
stood
before
the
fire
thinking
how
best
he
might
do
this
it
occurred
to
him
that
a
letter
from
a
distance
would
have
been
the
ready
and
simple
way
but
then
it
had
occurred
to
him
also
when
at
a
distance
that
a
declaration
of
his
purpose
face
to
face
was
the
simplest
and
readiest
way
if
you
have
to
go
headlong
into
the
water
you
should
take
your
plunge
without
hesitating
so
he
told
himself
making
up
his
mind
that
he
would
have
it
all
out
that
evening
at
dinner
lady
mabel
sat
next
to
his
father
and
he
could
watch
the
special
courtesy
with
which
the
duke
treated
the
girl
whom
he
was
so
desirous
of
introducing
to
his
house
silverbridge
could
not
talk
about
the
election
at
polpenno
because
all
conversation
about
tregear
was
interdicted
in
the
presence
of
his
sister
he
could
say
nothing
as
to
the
runnymede
hunt
and
the
two
thunderbolts
which
had
fallen
on
him
as
major
tifto
was
not
a
subject
on
which
he
could
expatiate
in
the
presence
of
his
father
he
asked
a
few
questions
about
the
shooting
and
referred
with
great
regret
to
his
absence
from
the
brake
country
i
am
sure
cassewary
could
spare
you
for
another
fortnight
the
duke
said
to
his
neighbour
alluding
to
a
visit
which
she
now
intended
to
make
if
so
he
would
have
to
spare
me
altogether
said
mabel
for
i
must
meet
my
father
in
london
in
the
middle
of
january
could
you
not
put
it
off
to
another
year
you
would
think
i
had
taken
root
and
was
growing
at
matching
of
all
our
products
you
would
be
the
most
delightful
and
the
most
charming
and
we
would
hope
the
most
permanent
said
the
courteous
duke
after
being
here
so
long
i
need
hardly
say
that
i
like
matching
better
than
any
place
in
the
world
i
suppose
it
is
the
contrast
to
grex
grex
was
a
palace
said
the
duke
before
a
wall
of
this
house
had
been
built
grex
is
very
old
and
very
wild
and
very
uncomfortable
but
i
love
it
dearly
matching
is
the
very
reverse
of
grex
not
i
hope
in
your
affections
i
did
not
mean
that
i
think
one
likes
a
contrast
but
i
must
go
say
on
the
first
of
january
to
pick
up
miss
cassewary
it
was
certain
therefore
that
she
was
going
on
the
first
of
january
how
would
it
be
if
he
put
off
the
telling
of
his
story
for
yet
another
week
till
she
should
be
gone
then
he
looked
around
and
bethought
himself
that
the
time
would
hang
very
heavy
with
him
and
his
father
would
daily
expect
from
him
a
declaration
exactly
opposed
to
that
which
he
had
to
make
he
had
no
horses
to
ride
as
he
went
on
listening
he
almost
convinced
himself
that
the
proper
thing
to
do
would
be
to
go
back
to
london
and
thence
write
to
his
father
he
made
no
confession
to
his
father
on
that
night
on
the
next
morning
there
was
a
heavy
fall
of
snow
but
nevertheless
everybody
managed
to
go
to
church
the
duke
as
he
looked
at
lady
mabel
tripping
along
over
the
swept
paths
in
her
furs
and
short
petticoats
and
boots
thought
that
his
son
was
a
lucky
fellow
to
have
the
chance
of
winning
the
love
of
such
a
girl
no
remembrance
of
miss
boncassen
came
across
his
mind
as
he
saw
them
close
together
it
was
so
important
that
silverbridge
should
marry
and
thus
be
kept
from
further
follies
and
it
was
so
momentous
to
the
fortunes
of
the
palliser
family
generally
that
he
should
marry
well
in
thinking
so
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
the
granddaughter
of
an
american
labourer
might
be
offered
to
him
a
young
lady
fit
to
be
duchess
of
omnium
was
not
to
be
found
everywhere
but
this
girl
he
thought
as
he
saw
her
walking
briskly
and
strongly
through
the
snow
with
every
mark
of
health
about
her
with
every
sign
of
high
breeding
very
beautiful
exquisite
in
manner
gracious
as
a
goddess
was
fit
to
be
a
duchess
silverbridge
at
this
moment
was
walking
close
to
her
side
in
good
looks
in
gracious
manner
in
high
breeding
her
equal
in
worldly
gifts
infinitely
her
superior
surely
she
would
not
despise
him
silverbridge
at
the
moment
was
expressing
a
hope
that
the
sermon
would
not
be
very
long
after
lunch
mabel
came
suddenly
behind
the
chair
on
which
silverbridge
was
sitting
and
asked
him
to
take
a
walk
with
her
was
she
not
afraid
of
the
snow
perhaps
you
are
she
said
laughing
i
do
not
mind
it
in
the
least
when
they
were
but
a
few
yards
from
the
front
door
she
put
her
hand
upon
his
arm
and
spoke
to
him
as
though
she
had
arranged
the
walk
with
reference
to
that
special
question
and
now
tell
me
all
about
frank
she
had
arranged
everything
she
had
a
plan
before
her
now
and
had
determined
in
accordance
with
that
plan
that
she
would
say
nothing
to
disturb
him
on
this
occasion
if
she
could
succeed
in
bringing
him
into
good
humour
with
herself
that
should
be
sufficient
for
now
tell
me
everything
about
frank
frank
is
member
of
parliament
for
polpenno
that
is
all
that
is
so
like
a
man
and
so
unlike
a
woman
what
did
he
say
what
did
he
do
how
did
he
look
what
did
you
say
what
did
you
do
how
did
you
look
we
looked
very
miserable
when
we
got
wet
through
walking
about
all
day
in
the
rain
was
that
necessary
quite
necessary
we
looked
so
mean
and
draggled
that
nobody
would
have
voted
for
us
only
that
poor
carbottle
looked
meaner
and
more
draggled
the
duke
says
you
made
ever
so
many
speeches
i
should
think
i
did
it
is
very
easy
to
make
speeches
down
at
a
place
like
that
tregear
spoke
like
a
book
he
spoke
well
awfully
well
he
told
them
that
all
the
good
things
that
had
ever
been
done
in
parliament
had
been
carried
by
the
tories
he
went
back
to
pitt
time
and
had
it
all
at
his
fingers
ends
and
quite
true
that
just
what
it
was
not
it
was
all
a
crammer
but
it
did
as
well
i
am
glad
he
is
a
member
do
you
think
the
duke
will
come
round
a
little
now
when
tregear
and
the
election
had
been
sufficiently
discussed
they
came
by
degrees
to
major
tifto
and
the
two
thunderbolts
silverbridge
when
he
perceived
that
nothing
was
to
be
said
about
isabel
boncassen
or
his
own
freedom
in
the
matter
of
was
not
sorry
to
have
a
friend
from
whom
he
could
find
sympathy
for
himself
in
his
own
troubles
with
some
encouragement
from
mabel
the
whole
story
was
told
was
it
not
a
great
impertinence
she
asked
it
was
an
awful
bore
what
could
i
say
i
was
not
going
to
pronounce
judgment
against
the
poor
devil
i
daresay
he
was
good
enough
for
mr
jawstock
but
i
suppose
he
did
cheat
horribly
i
daresay
he
did
a
great
many
of
them
do
cheat
but
what
of
that
i
was
not
bound
to
give
him
a
character
bad
or
good
certainly
not
he
had
not
been
my
servant
it
was
such
a
letter
i
show
it
you
when
we
get
in
asking
whether
tifto
was
fit
to
be
the
depositary
of
the
intimacy
of
the
runnymede
hunt
and
then
tif
letter
i
almost
wept
over
that
how
could
he
have
had
the
audacity
to
write
at
all
he
said
that
and
me
had
been
a
good
deal
together
unfortunately
that
was
true
even
now
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
he
lamed
the
horse
himself
everybody
thinks
he
did
percival
says
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
percival
knows
nothing
about
it
three
of
the
gang
ran
away
and
he
stood
his
ground
that
about
all
we
do
know
what
did
you
say
to
him
i
had
to
address
him
as
sir
and
beg
him
not
to
write
to
me
any
more
of
course
they
mean
to
get
rid
of
him
and
i
could
do
him
any
good
poor
tifto
upon
the
whole
i
think
i
hate
jawstock
worse
than
tifto
lady
mabel
was
content
with
her
afternoon
work
when
they
had
been
at
matching
before
the
polpenno
election
there
had
apparently
been
no
friendship
between
them
at
any
rate
no
confidential
friendship
miss
boncassen
had
been
there
and
he
had
had
neither
ears
nor
eyes
for
any
one
else
but
now
something
like
the
feeling
of
old
days
had
been
restored
she
had
not
done
much
towards
her
great
object
but
then
she
had
known
that
nothing
could
be
done
till
he
should
again
be
in
a
good
humour
with
her
on
the
sunday
the
monday
and
the
tuesday
they
were
again
together
in
some
of
these
interviews
silverbridge
described
the
polpenno
people
and
told
her
how
miss
tregear
had
been
reassured
by
his
eloquence
he
also
read
to
her
the
jawstock
and
tifto
correspondence
and
was
complimented
by
her
as
to
his
prudence
and
foresight
to
tell
the
truth
i
consulted
lupton
he
said
not
liking
to
take
credit
for
wisdom
which
had
not
been
his
own
then
they
talked
about
grex
and
killancodlem
about
gerald
and
the
shooting
about
love
for
tregear
and
about
the
work
of
the
coming
session
on
all
these
subjects
they
were
comfortable
and
confidential
miss
boncassen
name
never
having
been
as
yet
so
much
as
mentioned
but
still
the
real
work
was
before
her
she
had
not
hoped
to
bring
him
round
to
kneel
once
more
at
her
feet
by
such
gentle
measures
as
these
she
had
not
dared
to
dream
that
he
could
in
this
way
be
taught
to
forget
the
past
autumn
and
all
its
charms
she
knew
well
that
there
was
something
very
difficult
before
her
but
if
that
difficult
thing
might
be
done
at
all
these
were
the
preparations
which
must
be
made
for
the
doing
of
it
it
was
arranged
that
she
should
leave
matching
on
saturday
the
first
day
of
the
new
year
things
had
gone
on
in
the
manner
described
till
the
thursday
had
come
the
duke
had
been
impatient
but
had
restrained
himself
he
had
seen
that
they
were
much
together
and
that
they
were
apparently
friends
he
too
told
himself
that
there
were
two
more
days
and
that
before
the
end
of
those
days
everything
might
be
pleasantly
settled
it
had
become
a
matter
of
course
that
silverbridge
and
mabel
should
walk
together
in
the
afternoon
he
himself
had
felt
that
there
was
danger
in
this
not
danger
that
he
should
be
untrue
to
isabel
but
that
he
should
make
others
think
that
he
was
true
to
mabel
but
he
excused
himself
on
the
plea
that
he
and
mabel
had
been
intimate
friends
were
still
intimate
friends
and
that
she
was
going
away
in
a
day
or
two
mary
who
watched
it
all
was
sure
that
misery
was
being
prepared
for
someone
she
was
aware
that
by
this
time
her
father
was
anxious
to
welcome
mabel
as
his
she
strongly
suspected
that
something
had
been
said
between
her
father
and
her
brother
on
the
subject
but
then
she
had
isabel
direct
assurance
that
silverbridge
was
engaged
to
her
now
when
isabel
back
was
turned
silverbridge
and
mabel
were
always
together
on
the
thursday
after
lunch
they
were
again
out
together
it
had
become
so
much
a
habit
that
the
walk
repeated
itself
without
an
effort
it
had
been
part
of
mabel
scheme
that
it
should
be
so
during
all
this
morning
she
had
been
thinking
of
her
scheme
it
was
all
but
hopeless
so
much
she
had
declared
to
herself
but
forlorn
hopes
do
sometimes
end
in
splendid
triumphs
that
which
she
might
gain
was
so
much
and
what
could
she
lose
the
sweet
bloom
of
her
maiden
shame
that
she
told
herself
with
bitterest
inward
tears
was
already
gone
from
her
frank
tregear
at
any
rate
knew
where
her
heart
had
been
given
frank
tregear
knew
that
having
lost
her
heart
to
one
man
she
was
anxious
to
marry
another
he
knew
that
she
was
willing
to
accept
the
coronet
of
a
duchess
as
her
consolation
that
bloom
of
her
maiden
shame
of
which
she
quite
understood
the
sweetness
the
charm
the
value
was
gone
when
she
had
brought
herself
to
such
a
state
that
any
human
being
should
know
that
loving
one
man
she
should
be
willing
to
marry
another
the
sweet
treasure
was
gone
from
her
its
aroma
was
fled
it
behoved
her
now
to
be
ambitious
cautious
and
if
possible
successful
when
first
she
had
so
resolved
success
seemed
to
be
easily
within
her
reach
of
all
the
golden
youths
that
crossed
her
path
no
one
was
so
pleasant
to
her
eye
to
her
ear
to
her
feelings
generally
as
this
duke
young
heir
there
was
a
coming
manliness
about
him
which
she
liked
and
she
liked
even
the
slight
want
of
present
manliness
putting
aside
frank
tregear
she
could
go
nearer
to
loving
him
than
any
other
man
she
had
ever
seen
with
him
she
would
not
be
turned
from
her
duties
by
disgust
by
dislike
or
dismay
she
could
even
think
that
the
time
would
come
when
she
might
really
love
him
then
she
had
all
but
succeeded
and
she
might
have
succeeded
altogether
had
she
been
but
a
little
more
prudent
but
she
had
allowed
her
great
prize
to
escape
from
her
fingers
but
the
prize
was
not
yet
utterly
beyond
her
grasp
to
recover
it
to
recover
even
the
smallest
chance
of
recovering
it
there
would
be
need
of
great
exertion
she
must
be
bold
sudden
unwomanlike
and
yet
with
such
display
of
woman
charm
that
he
at
least
should
discover
no
want
she
must
be
false
but
false
with
such
perfect
deceit
that
he
must
regard
her
as
a
pearl
of
truth
if
anything
could
lure
him
back
it
must
be
his
conviction
of
her
passionate
love
and
she
must
be
strong
so
strong
as
to
overcome
not
only
his
weakness
but
all
that
was
strong
in
him
she
knew
that
he
did
love
that
other
girl
and
she
must
overcome
even
that
and
to
do
this
she
must
prostrate
herself
at
his
feet
as
since
the
world
began
it
has
been
man
province
to
prostrate
himself
at
the
feet
of
the
woman
he
loves
to
do
this
she
must
indeed
bid
adieu
to
the
sweet
bloom
of
her
maiden
shame
but
had
she
not
done
so
already
when
by
the
side
of
the
brook
at
killancodlem
she
had
declared
to
him
plainly
enough
her
despair
at
hearing
that
he
loved
that
other
girl
though
she
were
to
grovel
at
his
feet
she
could
not
speak
more
plainly
than
she
had
spoken
then
she
could
not
tell
her
story
now
more
plainly
than
she
had
done
then
but
though
the
chances
were
small
perchance
she
might
tell
it
more
effectually
perhaps
this
will
be
our
last
walk
she
said
come
down
to
the
seat
over
the
river
why
should
it
be
the
last
you
be
here
there
are
so
many
slips
in
such
things
she
said
laughing
you
may
get
a
letter
from
your
constituents
that
will
want
all
the
day
to
answer
or
your
father
may
have
a
political
communication
to
make
to
me
but
at
any
rate
come
so
they
went
to
the
seat
it
was
a
spot
in
the
park
from
whence
there
was
a
distant
view
over
many
lands
and
low
beneath
the
bench
which
stood
on
the
edge
of
a
steep
bank
ran
a
stream
which
made
a
sweeping
bend
in
this
place
so
that
a
reach
of
the
little
river
might
be
seen
both
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
though
the
sun
was
shining
the
snow
under
their
feet
was
hard
with
frost
it
was
an
air
such
as
one
sometimes
finds
in
england
and
often
in
america
though
the
cold
was
very
perceptible
though
water
in
the
shade
was
freezing
at
this
moment
there
was
no
feeling
of
damp
no
sense
of
bitter
wind
it
was
a
sweet
and
jocund
air
such
as
would
make
young
people
prone
to
run
and
skip
you
are
not
going
to
sit
down
with
all
the
snow
on
the
bench
said
silverbridge
on
their
way
thither
she
had
not
said
a
word
that
would
disturb
him
she
had
spoken
to
him
of
the
coming
session
and
had
managed
to
display
to
him
the
interest
which
she
took
in
his
parliamentary
career
in
doing
this
she
had
flattered
him
to
the
top
of
his
bent
if
he
would
return
to
his
father
politics
then
would
she
too
become
a
renegade
would
he
speak
in
the
next
session
she
hoped
he
would
speak
and
if
he
did
might
she
be
there
to
hear
him
she
was
cautious
not
to
say
a
word
of
frank
tregear
understanding
something
of
that
strange
jealousy
which
could
exist
even
when
he
who
was
jealous
did
not
love
the
woman
who
caused
it
no
she
said
i
do
not
think
we
can
sit
but
still
i
like
to
be
here
with
you
all
that
some
day
will
be
your
own
then
she
stretched
her
hands
out
to
the
far
view
some
of
it
i
suppose
i
do
think
it
is
all
ours
as
for
that
if
we
cared
for
extent
of
acres
one
ought
to
go
to
barsetshire
is
that
larger
twice
as
large
i
believe
and
yet
none
of
the
family
like
being
there
the
rental
is
very
well
and
the
borough
she
said
leaning
on
his
arm
and
looking
up
into
his
face
what
a
happy
fellow
you
ought
to
be
bar
tifto
and
mr
jawstock
you
have
got
rid
of
tifto
and
all
those
troubles
very
easily
thanks
to
the
governor
yes
indeed
i
do
love
your
father
so
dearly
so
do
i
rather
may
i
tell
you
something
about
him
as
she
asked
the
question
she
was
standing
very
close
to
him
leaning
upon
his
arm
with
her
left
hand
crossed
upon
her
right
had
others
been
there
of
course
she
would
not
have
stood
in
such
a
guise
she
knew
that
and
he
knew
it
too
of
course
there
was
something
in
it
of
declared
affection
of
that
kind
of
love
which
most
of
us
have
been
happy
enough
to
give
and
receive
without
intending
to
show
more
than
true
friendship
will
allow
at
special
moments
do
tell
me
anything
about
him
i
sha
like
to
hear
ah
that
is
so
hard
to
know
i
wish
you
would
like
to
hear
it
what
can
it
be
i
can
not
tell
you
now
why
not
and
why
did
you
offer
because
oh
silverbridge
he
certainly
as
yet
did
not
understand
it
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
she
would
know
what
were
his
father
wishes
perhaps
he
was
slow
of
comprehension
as
he
urged
her
to
tell
him
what
this
was
about
his
father
what
can
you
tell
me
about
him
that
i
should
not
like
to
hear
you
do
not
know
oh
silverbridge
i
think
you
know
then
there
came
upon
him
a
glimmering
of
the
truth
you
do
know
and
she
stood
apart
looking
him
full
in
the
face
i
do
not
know
what
you
can
have
to
tell
me
no
no
it
is
not
i
that
should
tell
you
but
yet
it
is
so
silverbridge
what
did
you
say
to
me
when
you
came
to
me
that
morning
in
the
square
what
did
i
say
was
i
not
entitled
to
think
that
you
loved
me
to
this
he
had
nothing
to
reply
but
stood
before
her
silent
and
frowning
think
of
it
silverbridge
was
it
not
so
and
because
i
did
not
at
once
tell
you
all
the
truth
because
i
did
not
there
say
that
my
heart
was
all
yours
were
you
right
to
leave
me
you
only
laughed
at
me
no
no
no
i
never
laughed
at
you
how
could
i
laugh
when
you
were
all
the
world
to
me
ask
frank
he
knew
ask
miss
cass
she
knew
and
can
you
say
you
did
not
know
you
you
you
yourself
can
any
girl
suppose
that
such
words
as
these
are
to
mean
nothing
when
they
have
been
spoken
you
knew
i
loved
you
no
no
you
must
have
known
it
i
will
never
believe
but
that
you
knew
it
why
should
your
father
be
so
sure
of
it
he
never
was
sure
of
it
yes
silverbridge
yes
there
is
not
one
in
the
house
who
does
not
see
that
he
treats
me
as
though
he
expected
me
to
be
his
son
wife
do
you
not
know
that
he
wishes
it
he
fain
would
not
have
answered
this
but
she
paused
for
his
answer
and
then
repeated
her
question
do
you
not
know
that
he
wishes
it
i
think
he
does
said
silverbridge
but
it
can
never
be
so
oh
silverbridge
oh
my
loved
one
do
not
say
that
to
me
do
not
kill
me
at
once
now
she
placed
her
hands
one
on
each
arm
as
she
stood
opposite
to
him
and
looked
up
into
his
face
you
said
you
loved
me
once
why
do
you
desert
me
now
have
you
a
right
to
treat
me
like
that
when
i
tell
you
that
you
have
all
my
heart
the
tears
were
now
streaming
down
her
face
and
they
were
not
counterfeit
tears
you
know
he
said
submitting
to
her
hands
but
not
lifting
his
arm
to
embrace
her
what
do
i
know
that
i
have
given
all
i
have
to
give
to
another
as
he
said
this
he
looked
away
sternly
over
her
shoulder
to
the
distance
that
american
girl
she
exclaimed
starting
back
with
some
show
of
sternness
also
on
her
brow
yes
that
american
girl
said
silverbridge
then
she
recovered
herself
immediately
indignation
natural
indignation
would
not
serve
her
turn
in
the
present
emergency
you
know
that
can
not
be
you
ought
to
know
it
what
will
your
father
say
you
have
not
dared
to
tell
him
that
is
so
natural
she
added
trying
to
appease
his
frown
how
possibly
can
it
be
told
to
him
i
will
not
say
a
word
against
her
no
do
not
do
that
but
there
are
fitnesses
of
things
which
such
a
one
as
you
can
not
disregard
without
preparing
for
yourself
a
whole
life
of
repentance
look
here
mabel
well
i
will
tell
you
the
truth
well
i
would
sooner
lose
all
the
rank
i
have
the
rank
that
i
am
to
have
all
these
lands
that
you
have
been
looking
on
my
wealth
my
seat
in
parliament
everything
that
fortune
has
done
for
me
i
would
give
them
all
up
sooner
than
lose
her
now
at
any
rate
he
was
a
man
she
was
sure
of
that
now
this
was
more
very
much
more
not
only
than
she
had
expected
from
him
but
more
than
she
had
thought
it
possible
that
his
character
should
have
produced
his
strength
reduced
her
to
weakness
and
i
am
nothing
she
said
yes
indeed
you
are
lady
mabel
grex
whom
all
women
envy
and
whom
all
men
honour
the
poorest
wretch
this
day
under
the
sun
do
not
say
that
you
should
take
shame
to
say
that
i
do
take
shame
and
i
do
say
it
sir
do
you
not
feel
what
you
owe
me
do
you
not
know
that
you
have
made
me
the
wretch
i
am
how
did
you
dare
to
talk
to
me
as
you
did
talk
when
you
were
in
london
you
tell
me
that
i
am
lady
mabel
grex
and
yet
you
come
to
me
with
a
lie
on
your
lips
with
such
a
lie
as
that
you
must
have
taken
me
for
some
nursemaid
on
whom
you
had
condescended
to
cast
your
eye
it
can
not
be
that
even
you
should
have
dared
to
treat
lady
mabel
grex
after
such
a
fashion
as
that
and
now
you
have
cast
your
eye
on
this
other
girl
you
can
never
marry
her
i
shall
endeavour
to
do
so
you
can
never
marry
her
she
said
stamping
her
foot
she
had
now
lost
all
the
caution
which
she
had
taught
herself
for
the
prosecution
of
her
scheme
all
the
care
with
which
she
had
burdened
herself
now
she
was
natural
enough
no
you
can
never
marry
her
you
could
not
show
yourself
after
it
in
your
clubs
or
in
parliament
or
in
the
world
come
home
do
you
say
no
i
will
not
go
to
your
home
it
is
not
my
home
cold
of
course
i
am
cold
cold
through
to
the
heart
i
can
not
leave
you
alone
here
he
said
for
she
had
now
turned
from
him
and
was
walking
with
hurried
steps
and
short
turns
on
the
edge
of
the
bank
which
at
this
place
was
almost
a
precipice
you
have
left
me
utterly
in
the
cold
more
desolate
than
i
am
here
even
though
i
should
spend
the
night
among
the
trees
but
i
will
go
back
and
will
tell
your
father
everything
if
my
father
were
other
than
he
is
if
my
brother
were
better
to
me
you
would
not
have
done
this
if
you
had
a
legion
of
brothers
it
would
have
been
the
same
he
said
turning
sharp
upon
her
they
walked
on
together
but
without
a
word
till
the
house
was
in
sight
then
she
looked
round
at
him
and
stopped
him
on
the
path
as
she
caught
his
eye
silverbridge
she
said
lady
mabel
call
me
mabel
at
any
rate
call
me
mabel
if
i
have
said
anything
to
offend
you
i
beg
your
pardon
i
am
not
offended
but
unhappy
if
you
are
unhappy
what
must
i
be
what
have
i
to
look
forward
to
give
me
your
hand
and
say
that
we
are
friends
certainly
we
are
friends
he
said
as
he
gave
her
his
hand
who
can
tell
what
may
come
to
pass
to
this
he
would
make
no
answer
as
it
seemed
to
imply
that
some
division
between
himself
and
isabel
boncassen
might
possibly
come
to
pass
you
will
not
tell
any
one
that
i
love
you
i
tell
such
a
thing
as
that
but
never
forget
it
yourself
no
one
can
tell
what
may
come
to
pass
lady
mabel
at
once
went
up
to
her
room
she
had
played
her
scene
but
was
well
aware
that
she
had
played
it
altogether
unsuccessfully
chapter
lx
lord
gerald
in
further
trouble
when
silverbridge
got
back
to
the
house
he
was
by
no
means
well
pleased
with
himself
in
the
first
place
he
was
unhappy
to
think
that
mabel
was
unhappy
and
that
he
had
made
her
so
and
then
she
had
told
him
that
he
would
not
have
dared
to
have
acted
as
he
had
done
but
that
her
father
and
her
brother
were
careless
to
defend
her
he
had
replied
fiercely
that
a
legion
of
brothers
ready
to
act
on
her
behalf
would
not
have
altered
his
conduct
but
not
the
less
did
he
feel
that
he
had
behaved
badly
to
her
it
could
not
now
be
altered
he
could
not
now
be
untrue
to
isabel
but
certainly
he
had
said
a
word
or
two
to
mabel
which
he
could
not
remember
without
regret
he
had
not
thought
that
a
word
from
him
could
have
been
so
powerful
now
when
that
word
was
recalled
to
his
memory
by
the
girl
to
whom
it
had
been
spoken
he
could
not
quite
acquit
himself
and
mabel
had
declared
to
him
that
she
would
at
once
appeal
to
his
father
there
was
an
absurdity
in
this
at
which
he
could
not
but
smile
that
the
girl
should
complain
to
his
father
because
he
would
not
marry
her
but
even
in
doing
this
she
might
cause
him
great
vexation
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
ask
her
not
to
tell
her
story
to
the
duke
he
must
take
all
that
as
it
might
come
while
he
was
thinking
of
all
this
in
his
own
room
a
servant
brought
him
two
letters
from
the
first
which
he
opened
he
soon
perceived
that
it
contained
an
account
of
more
troubles
it
was
from
his
brother
gerald
and
was
written
from
auld
reikie
the
name
of
a
house
in
scotland
belonging
to
lord
nidderdale
people
dear
silver
i
have
got
into
a
most
awful
scrape
that
fellow
percival
is
here
and
dolly
longstaff
and
nidderdale
and
popplecourt
and
jack
hindes
and
perry
who
is
in
the
coldstreams
and
one
or
two
more
and
there
has
been
a
lot
of
cards
and
i
have
lost
ever
so
much
money
i
mind
it
so
much
but
percival
has
won
it
all
a
fellow
i
hate
and
now
i
owe
him
three
thousand
four
hundred
pounds
he
has
just
told
me
he
is
hard
up
and
that
he
wants
the
money
before
the
week
is
over
he
ca
be
hard
up
because
he
has
won
from
everybody
but
of
course
i
had
to
tell
him
that
i
would
pay
him
can
you
help
me
of
course
i
know
that
i
have
been
a
fool
percival
knows
what
he
is
about
and
plays
regularly
for
money
when
i
began
i
did
think
that
i
could
lose
above
twenty
or
thirty
pounds
but
it
got
on
from
one
thing
to
another
and
when
i
woke
this
morning
i
felt
i
did
know
what
to
do
with
myself
you
ca
think
how
the
luck
went
against
me
everybody
says
that
they
never
saw
such
cards
and
now
do
tell
me
how
i
am
to
get
out
of
it
could
you
manage
it
with
moreton
of
course
i
will
make
it
all
right
with
you
some
day
moreton
always
lets
you
have
whatever
you
want
but
perhaps
you
could
do
this
without
letting
the
governor
know
i
would
rather
anything
than
that
there
is
some
money
owing
at
oxford
also
which
of
course
he
must
know
i
was
thinking
that
perhaps
i
might
get
it
from
some
of
those
fellows
in
london
there
are
people
called
comfort
and
criball
who
let
men
have
money
constantly
i
know
two
or
three
up
at
oxford
who
have
had
it
from
them
of
course
i
could
go
to
them
as
you
could
do
for
in
spite
of
what
the
governor
said
to
us
up
in
london
one
day
there
is
nothing
that
must
come
to
me
but
you
could
do
anything
in
that
way
and
of
course
i
would
stand
to
it
i
know
you
wo
throw
me
over
because
you
always
have
been
such
a
brick
but
above
all
things
do
tell
the
governor
percival
is
such
a
nasty
fellow
otherwise
i
should
mind
it
he
spoke
this
morning
as
though
i
was
treating
him
badly
though
the
money
was
only
lost
last
night
and
he
looked
at
me
in
a
way
that
made
me
long
to
kick
him
i
told
him
not
to
flurry
himself
and
that
he
should
have
his
money
if
he
speaks
to
me
like
that
again
i
will
kick
him
i
will
be
at
matching
as
soon
as
possible
but
i
can
not
go
till
this
is
settled
nid
meaning
lord
nidderdale
is
a
brick
your
affectionate
brother
gerald
the
other
was
from
nidderdale
and
referred
to
the
same
subject
dear
silverbridge
here
has
been
a
terrible
nuisance
last
night
some
of
the
men
got
to
playing
cards
and
gerald
lost
a
terribly
large
sum
to
percival
i
did
all
that
i
could
to
stop
it
because
i
saw
that
percival
was
going
in
for
a
big
thing
i
fancy
that
he
got
as
much
from
dolly
longstaff
as
he
did
from
gerald
but
it
wo
matter
much
to
dolly
or
if
it
does
nobody
cares
gerald
told
me
he
was
writing
to
you
about
it
so
i
am
not
betraying
him
what
is
to
be
done
of
course
percival
is
behaving
badly
he
always
does
i
ca
turn
him
out
of
the
house
and
he
seems
to
intend
to
stick
to
gerald
till
he
has
got
the
money
he
has
taken
a
cheque
from
dolly
dated
two
months
hence
i
am
in
an
awful
funk
for
fear
gerald
should
pitch
into
him
he
will
in
a
minute
if
anything
rough
is
said
to
him
i
suppose
the
straightest
thing
would
be
to
go
to
the
duke
at
once
but
gerald
wo
hear
of
it
i
hope
you
wo
think
me
wrong
to
tell
you
if
i
could
help
him
i
would
you
know
what
a
bad
doctor
i
am
for
that
sort
of
complaint
yours
always
nidderdale
the
had
rung
before
silverbridge
had
come
to
an
end
of
thinking
of
this
new
vexation
and
he
had
not
as
yet
made
up
his
mind
what
he
had
better
do
for
his
brother
there
was
one
thing
as
to
which
he
was
determined
that
it
should
not
be
done
by
him
nor
if
he
could
prevent
it
by
gerald
there
should
be
no
dealings
with
comfort
and
criball
the
duke
had
succeeded
at
any
rate
in
filling
his
son
mind
with
a
horror
of
aid
of
that
sort
nidderdale
had
suggested
that
the
straightest
thing
would
be
to
go
direct
to
the
duke
that
no
doubt
would
be
straight
and
efficacious
the
duke
would
not
have
allowed
a
boy
of
his
to
be
a
debtor
to
lord
percival
for
a
day
let
the
debt
have
been
contracted
how
it
might
but
gerald
had
declared
against
this
course
and
silverbridge
himself
would
have
been
most
unwilling
to
adopt
it
how
could
he
have
told
that
story
to
the
duke
while
there
was
that
other
infinitely
more
important
story
of
his
own
which
must
be
told
at
once
in
the
midst
of
all
these
troubles
he
went
down
to
dinner
lady
mabel
said
the
duke
tells
me
that
you
two
have
been
to
see
sir
guy
she
was
standing
close
to
the
duke
and
whispered
a
word
into
his
ear
you
said
you
would
call
me
mabel
yes
sir
said
silverbridge
and
i
have
made
up
my
mind
that
sir
guy
never
stayed
there
very
long
in
winter
it
was
awfully
cold
i
had
furs
on
said
mabel
what
a
lovely
spot
it
is
even
in
this
weather
then
dinner
was
announced
she
had
not
been
cold
she
could
still
feel
the
tingling
heat
of
her
blood
as
she
had
implored
him
to
love
her
silverbridge
felt
that
he
must
write
to
his
brother
by
the
first
post
the
communication
was
of
a
nature
that
would
bear
no
delay
if
his
hands
had
been
free
he
would
himself
have
gone
off
to
auld
reikie
at
last
he
made
up
his
mind
the
first
letter
he
wrote
was
neither
to
nidderdale
nor
to
gerald
but
to
lord
percival
himself
dear
percival
gerald
writes
me
word
that
he
has
lost
to
you
at
cards
and
he
wants
me
to
get
him
the
money
it
is
a
terrible
nuisance
and
he
has
been
an
ass
but
of
course
i
shall
stand
to
him
for
anything
he
wants
i
got
in
my
pocket
and
i
do
know
any
one
who
has
that
is
among
our
set
but
i
send
you
my
for
the
amount
and
will
promise
to
get
you
the
money
in
two
months
i
suppose
that
will
be
sufficient
and
that
you
will
not
bother
gerald
any
more
about
it
yours
truly
silverbridge
then
he
copied
this
letter
and
enclosed
the
copy
in
another
which
he
wrote
to
his
brother
dear
gerald
what
an
ass
you
have
been
but
i
do
suppose
you
are
worse
than
i
was
at
doncaster
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
such
people
as
comfort
and
criball
that
is
the
sure
way
to
the
d
as
for
telling
moreton
that
is
only
a
polite
and
roundabout
way
of
telling
the
governor
he
would
immediately
ask
the
governor
what
was
to
be
done
you
will
see
what
i
have
done
of
course
i
must
tell
the
governor
before
the
end
of
february
as
i
can
not
get
the
money
in
any
other
way
but
that
i
will
do
it
does
seem
hard
upon
him
not
that
the
money
will
hurt
him
much
but
that
he
would
so
like
to
have
a
son
i
suppose
percival
wo
make
any
bother
about
the
he
be
a
fool
if
he
does
i
would
kick
him
if
i
were
you
unless
he
says
anything
very
bad
you
would
be
sure
to
come
to
grief
somehow
he
is
a
beast
your
affectionate
brother
silverbridge
with
these
letters
that
special
grief
was
removed
from
his
mind
for
awhile
looking
over
the
dark
river
of
possible
trouble
which
seemed
to
run
between
the
present
moment
and
the
time
at
which
the
money
must
be
procured
he
thought
that
he
had
driven
off
this
calamity
of
gerald
to
infinite
distance
but
into
that
dark
river
he
must
now
plunge
almost
at
once
on
the
next
day
he
managed
so
that
there
should
be
no
walk
with
mabel
in
the
evening
he
could
see
that
the
duke
was
uneasy
but
not
a
word
was
said
to
him
on
the
following
morning
lady
mabel
took
her
departure
when
she
went
from
the
door
both
the
duke
and
silverbridge
were
there
to
bid
her
farewell
she
smiled
and
was
as
gracious
as
though
everything
had
gone
according
to
her
heart
delight
dear
duke
i
am
so
obliged
to
you
for
your
kindness
she
said
as
she
put
up
her
cheek
for
him
to
kiss
then
she
gave
her
hand
to
silverbridge
of
course
you
will
come
and
see
me
in
town
and
she
smiled
upon
them
all
having
courage
enough
to
keep
down
all
her
sufferings
come
in
here
a
moment
silverbridge
said
the
father
as
they
returned
into
the
house
together
how
is
it
now
between
you
and
her
chapter
lxi
bone
of
my
bone
how
is
it
now
between
you
and
her
that
was
the
question
which
the
duke
put
to
his
son
as
soon
as
he
had
closed
the
door
of
the
study
lady
mabel
had
just
been
dismissed
from
the
front
door
on
her
journey
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
her
intended
no
such
question
would
have
been
asked
had
not
silverbridge
himself
declared
to
his
father
his
purpose
of
making
lady
mabel
his
wife
on
that
subject
the
duke
without
such
authority
would
not
have
interfered
but
he
had
been
consulted
had
acceded
and
had
encouraged
the
idea
by
excessive
liberality
on
his
part
he
had
never
dropped
it
out
of
his
mind
for
a
moment
but
when
he
found
that
the
girl
was
leaving
his
house
without
any
explanation
then
he
became
restless
and
inquisitive
they
say
that
perfect
love
casteth
out
fear
if
it
be
so
the
love
of
children
to
their
parents
is
seldom
altogether
perfect
and
perhaps
had
better
not
be
quite
perfect
with
this
young
man
it
was
not
that
he
feared
anything
which
his
father
could
do
to
him
that
he
believed
that
in
consequence
of
the
declaration
which
he
had
to
make
his
comforts
and
pleasures
would
be
curtailed
or
his
independence
diminished
he
knew
his
father
too
well
to
dread
such
punishment
but
he
feared
that
he
would
make
his
father
unhappy
and
he
was
conscious
that
he
had
so
often
sinned
in
that
way
he
had
stumbled
so
frequently
though
in
action
he
would
so
often
be
thoughtless
yet
he
understood
perfectly
the
effect
which
had
been
produced
on
his
father
mind
by
his
conduct
he
had
it
at
heart
to
be
good
to
the
governor
to
gratify
that
most
loving
of
all
possible
friends
who
as
he
knew
well
was
always
thinking
of
his
welfare
and
yet
he
never
had
been
good
to
the
governor
nor
had
gerald
and
to
all
this
was
added
his
sister
determined
perversity
it
was
thus
he
feared
his
father
he
paused
for
a
moment
while
the
duke
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
looking
at
him
i
afraid
that
it
is
all
over
sir
he
said
all
over
i
am
afraid
so
why
is
it
all
over
has
she
refused
you
well
sir
it
is
quite
that
then
he
paused
again
it
was
so
difficult
to
begin
about
isabel
boncassen
i
am
sorry
for
that
said
the
duke
almost
hesitating
very
sorry
you
will
understand
i
hope
that
i
should
make
no
inquiry
in
such
a
matter
unless
i
had
felt
myself
warranted
in
doing
so
by
what
you
had
yourself
told
me
in
london
i
understand
all
that
i
have
been
very
anxious
about
it
and
have
even
gone
so
far
as
to
make
some
preparations
for
what
i
had
hoped
would
be
your
early
marriage
preparations
exclaimed
silverbridge
thinking
of
church
bells
bride
cake
and
wedding
presents
as
to
the
property
i
am
so
anxious
that
you
should
enjoy
all
the
settled
independence
which
can
belong
to
an
english
gentleman
i
never
plough
or
sow
i
know
no
more
of
sheep
and
bulls
than
of
the
extinct
animals
of
earlier
ages
i
would
not
have
it
so
with
you
i
would
fain
see
you
surrounded
by
those
things
which
ought
to
interest
a
nobleman
in
this
country
why
is
it
all
over
with
lady
mabel
grex
the
young
man
looked
imploringly
at
his
father
as
though
earnestly
begging
that
nothing
more
might
be
said
about
mabel
i
had
changed
my
mind
before
i
found
out
that
she
was
really
in
love
with
me
he
could
not
say
that
he
could
not
hint
that
he
might
still
have
mabel
if
he
would
the
only
thing
for
him
was
to
tell
everything
about
isabel
boncassen
he
felt
that
in
doing
this
he
must
begin
with
himself
i
have
rather
changed
my
mind
sir
he
said
since
we
were
walking
together
in
london
that
night
have
you
quarrelled
with
lady
mabel
oh
dear
no
i
am
very
fond
of
mabel
only
not
just
like
that
not
just
like
what
i
had
better
tell
the
whole
truth
at
once
certainly
tell
the
truth
silverbridge
i
can
not
say
that
you
are
bound
in
duty
to
tell
the
whole
truth
even
to
your
father
in
such
a
matter
but
i
mean
to
tell
you
everything
mabel
did
not
seem
to
care
for
me
much
in
london
and
then
i
saw
someone
someone
i
liked
better
then
he
stopped
but
as
the
duke
did
not
ask
any
questions
he
plunged
on
it
was
miss
boncassen
miss
boncassen
yes
sir
said
silverbridge
with
a
little
access
of
decision
the
american
young
lady
yes
sir
do
you
know
anything
of
her
family
i
think
i
know
all
about
her
family
it
is
not
much
in
the
way
of
family
you
have
not
spoken
to
her
about
it
yes
sir
i
have
settled
it
all
with
her
on
condition
settled
it
with
her
that
she
is
to
be
your
wife
yes
sir
on
condition
that
you
will
approve
did
you
go
to
her
silverbridge
with
such
a
stipulation
as
that
it
was
not
like
that
how
was
it
then
she
stipulated
she
will
marry
me
if
you
will
consent
it
was
she
then
who
thought
of
my
wishes
and
my
feeling
not
you
i
knew
that
i
loved
her
what
is
a
man
to
do
when
he
feels
like
that
of
course
i
meant
to
tell
you
the
duke
was
now
looking
very
black
i
thought
you
liked
her
sir
liked
her
i
did
like
her
i
do
like
her
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
do
you
think
i
like
none
but
those
with
whom
i
should
think
it
fitting
to
ally
myself
in
marriage
is
there
to
be
no
duty
in
such
matters
no
restraint
no
feeling
of
what
is
due
to
your
own
name
and
to
others
who
bear
it
the
lad
out
there
who
is
sweeping
the
walks
can
marry
the
first
girl
that
pleases
his
eye
if
she
will
take
him
perhaps
his
lot
is
the
happier
because
he
owns
such
liberty
have
you
the
same
freedom
i
suppose
i
have
by
law
do
you
recognise
no
duty
but
what
the
laws
impose
upon
you
should
you
be
disposed
to
eat
and
drink
in
bestial
excess
because
the
laws
would
not
hinder
you
should
you
lie
and
sleep
all
the
day
the
law
would
say
nothing
should
you
neglect
every
duty
which
your
position
imposes
on
you
the
law
could
not
interfere
to
such
a
one
as
you
the
law
can
be
no
guide
you
should
so
live
as
not
to
come
near
the
law
or
to
have
the
law
to
come
near
to
you
from
all
evil
against
which
the
law
bars
you
you
should
be
barred
at
an
infinite
distance
by
honour
by
conscience
and
nobility
does
the
law
require
patriotism
philanthropy
public
service
purity
of
purpose
devotion
to
the
needs
of
others
who
have
been
placed
in
the
world
below
you
the
law
is
a
great
thing
because
men
are
poor
and
weak
and
bad
and
it
is
great
because
where
it
exists
in
its
strength
no
tyrant
can
be
above
it
but
between
you
and
me
there
should
be
no
mention
of
law
as
the
guide
of
conduct
speak
to
me
of
honour
of
duty
and
of
nobility
and
tell
me
what
they
require
of
you
silverbridge
listened
in
silence
and
with
something
of
true
admiration
in
his
heart
but
he
felt
the
strong
necessity
of
declaring
his
own
convictions
on
one
special
point
here
at
once
in
this
new
crisis
of
the
conversation
that
accident
in
regard
to
the
colour
of
the
dean
lodge
had
stood
in
the
way
of
his
logical
studies
so
that
he
was
unable
to
put
his
argument
into
proper
shape
but
there
belonged
to
him
a
certain
natural
astuteness
which
told
him
that
he
must
put
in
his
rejoinder
at
this
particular
point
i
think
i
am
bound
in
honour
and
in
duty
to
marry
miss
boncassen
he
said
and
if
i
understand
what
you
mean
by
nobility
just
as
much
because
you
have
promised
not
only
for
that
i
have
promised
and
therefore
i
am
bound
she
has
well
she
has
said
that
she
loves
me
and
therefore
of
course
i
am
bound
but
it
is
not
only
that
what
do
you
mean
i
suppose
a
man
ought
to
marry
the
woman
he
loves
if
he
can
get
her
no
no
not
so
not
always
so
do
you
think
that
love
is
a
passion
that
can
not
be
withstood
but
here
we
are
both
of
one
mind
sir
when
i
saw
how
you
seemed
to
take
to
her
take
to
her
can
i
not
interest
myself
in
human
beings
without
wishing
to
make
them
flesh
of
my
flesh
bone
of
my
bone
what
am
i
to
think
of
you
it
was
but
the
other
day
that
all
that
you
are
now
telling
me
of
miss
boncassen
you
were
telling
me
of
lady
mabel
grex
here
poor
silverbridge
bit
his
lips
and
shook
his
head
and
looked
down
upon
the
ground
this
was
the
weak
part
of
his
case
he
could
not
tell
his
father
the
whole
story
about
mabel
that
she
had
coyed
his
love
so
that
he
had
been
justified
in
thinking
himself
free
from
any
claim
in
that
direction
when
he
had
encountered
the
infinitely
sweeter
charms
of
isabel
boncassen
you
are
weak
as
water
said
the
unhappy
father
i
am
not
weak
in
this
did
you
not
say
exactly
the
same
about
lady
mabel
there
was
a
pause
so
that
he
was
driven
to
reply
i
found
her
as
i
thought
indifferent
and
then
i
changed
my
mind
indifferent
what
does
she
think
about
it
now
does
she
know
of
this
how
does
it
stand
between
you
two
at
the
present
moment
she
knows
that
i
am
engaged
to
miss
boncassen
does
she
approve
of
it
why
should
i
ask
her
sir
i
have
not
asked
her
then
why
did
you
tell
her
she
could
not
but
have
spoken
her
mind
when
you
told
her
there
must
have
been
much
between
you
when
this
was
talked
of
the
unfortunate
young
man
was
obliged
to
take
some
time
before
he
could
answer
this
appeal
he
had
to
own
that
his
father
had
some
justice
on
his
side
but
at
the
same
time
he
could
reveal
nothing
of
mabel
secret
i
told
her
because
we
were
friends
i
did
not
ask
her
approval
but
she
did
disapprove
she
thought
that
your
son
should
not
marry
an
american
girl
without
family
of
course
she
would
feel
that
now
i
have
told
you
what
she
said
and
i
hope
you
will
ask
me
no
further
questions
about
her
i
can
not
make
lady
mabel
my
wife
though
for
the
matter
of
that
i
ought
not
to
presume
that
she
would
take
me
if
i
wished
it
i
had
intended
to
ask
you
to
consent
to
my
marriage
with
miss
boncassen
i
can
not
give
you
my
consent
then
i
am
very
unhappy
how
can
i
believe
as
to
your
unhappiness
when
you
would
have
said
the
same
about
lady
mabel
grex
a
few
weeks
ago
nearly
eight
months
said
silverbridge
what
is
the
difference
it
is
not
the
time
but
the
disposition
of
the
man
i
can
not
give
you
my
consent
the
young
lady
sees
it
in
the
right
light
and
that
will
make
your
escape
easy
i
do
not
want
to
escape
she
has
indicated
the
cause
which
will
separate
you
i
will
not
be
separated
from
her
said
silverbridge
who
was
beginning
to
feel
that
he
was
subjugated
to
tyranny
if
he
chose
to
marry
isabel
no
one
could
have
a
right
to
hinder
him
i
can
only
hope
that
you
will
think
better
of
it
and
that
when
next
you
speak
to
me
on
that
or
any
other
subject
you
will
answer
me
with
less
arrogance
this
rebuke
was
terrible
to
the
son
whose
mind
at
the
present
moment
was
filled
with
two
ideas
that
of
constancy
to
isabel
boncassen
and
then
of
respect
and
affection
for
his
father
indeed
sir
he
said
i
am
not
arrogant
and
if
i
have
answered
improperly
i
beg
your
pardon
but
my
mind
is
made
up
about
this
and
i
thought
you
had
better
know
how
it
is
i
do
not
see
that
i
can
say
anything
else
to
you
now
i
think
of
going
to
harrington
this
afternoon
then
the
duke
with
further
very
visible
annoyance
asked
where
harrington
was
it
was
explained
that
harrington
was
lord
chiltern
seat
lord
chiltern
being
the
master
of
the
brake
hounds
that
it
was
his
son
purpose
to
remain
six
weeks
among
the
brake
hounds
but
that
he
should
stay
only
a
day
or
two
with
lord
chiltern
then
it
appeared
that
silverbridge
intended
to
put
himself
up
at
a
hunting
inn
in
the
neighbourhood
and
the
duke
did
not
at
all
like
the
plan
that
his
son
should
choose
to
live
at
an
inn
when
the
comforts
of
an
english
country
house
were
open
to
him
was
distasteful
and
almost
offensive
to
the
duke
and
the
matter
was
not
improved
when
he
was
made
to
understand
that
all
this
was
to
be
done
for
the
sake
of
hunting
there
had
been
the
shooting
in
scotland
then
the
racing
ah
alas
yes
the
racing
and
the
betting
at
doncaster
then
the
shooting
at
matching
had
been
made
to
appear
to
be
the
chief
reason
why
he
himself
had
been
living
in
his
own
house
and
now
his
son
was
going
away
to
live
at
an
inn
in
order
that
more
time
might
be
devoted
to
hunting
why
ca
you
hunt
here
at
home
if
you
must
hunt
it
is
all
woodland
said
silverbridge
i
thought
you
wanted
woods
lord
chiltern
is
always
troubling
me
about
trumpington
wood
this
breeze
about
the
hunting
enabled
the
son
to
escape
without
any
further
allusion
to
miss
boncassen
he
did
escape
and
proceeded
to
turn
over
in
his
mind
all
that
had
been
said
his
tale
had
been
told
a
great
burden
was
thus
taken
off
his
shoulders
he
could
tell
isabel
so
much
and
thus
free
himself
from
the
suspicion
of
having
been
afraid
to
declare
his
purpose
she
should
know
what
he
had
done
and
should
be
made
to
understand
that
he
had
been
firm
he
had
he
thought
been
very
firm
and
gave
himself
some
credit
on
that
head
his
father
no
doubt
had
been
firm
too
but
that
he
had
expected
his
father
had
said
much
all
that
about
honour
and
duty
had
been
very
good
but
this
was
certain
that
when
a
young
man
had
promised
a
young
woman
he
ought
to
keep
his
word
and
he
thought
that
there
were
certain
changes
going
on
in
the
management
of
the
world
which
his
father
did
not
quite
understand
fathers
never
do
quite
understand
the
changes
which
are
manifest
to
their
sons
some
years
ago
it
might
have
been
improper
that
an
american
girl
should
be
elevated
to
the
rank
of
an
english
duchess
but
now
all
that
was
altered
the
duke
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
alone
and
was
not
happy
in
his
solitude
all
that
silverbridge
had
told
him
was
sad
to
him
he
had
taught
himself
to
think
that
he
could
love
lady
mabel
as
an
affectionate
father
wishes
to
love
his
son
wife
he
had
set
himself
to
wish
to
like
her
and
had
been
successful
being
most
anxious
that
his
son
should
marry
he
had
prepared
himself
to
be
more
than
ordinarily
liberal
to
be
in
every
way
gracious
his
children
were
now
everything
to
him
and
among
his
children
his
son
and
heir
was
the
chief
from
the
moment
in
which
he
had
heard
from
silverbridge
that
lady
mabel
was
chosen
he
had
given
himself
up
to
considering
how
he
might
best
promote
their
interests
how
he
might
best
enable
them
to
live
with
that
dignity
and
splendour
which
he
himself
had
unwisely
despised
that
the
son
who
was
to
come
after
him
should
be
worthy
of
the
place
assigned
to
his
name
had
been
of
personal
objects
the
nearest
to
his
heart
there
had
been
failures
but
still
there
had
been
left
room
for
hope
the
boy
had
been
unfortunate
at
eton
but
how
many
unfortunate
boys
had
become
great
men
he
had
disgraced
himself
by
his
folly
at
college
but
though
some
lads
will
be
men
at
twenty
others
are
then
little
more
than
children
the
fruit
that
ripens
the
soonest
is
seldom
the
best
then
had
come
tifto
and
the
racing
mania
nothing
could
be
worse
than
tifto
and
but
from
that
evil
silverbridge
had
seemed
to
be
made
free
by
the
very
disgust
which
the
vileness
of
the
circumstance
had
produced
perhaps
tifto
driving
a
nail
into
his
horse
foot
had
on
the
whole
been
serviceable
that
apostasy
from
the
political
creed
of
the
pallisers
had
been
a
blow
much
more
felt
than
the
loss
of
the
seventy
thousand
pounds
but
even
under
that
blow
he
had
consoled
himself
by
thinking
that
a
conservative
patriotic
nobleman
may
serve
his
country
even
as
a
conservative
in
the
midst
of
this
he
had
felt
that
the
surest
resource
for
his
son
against
evil
would
be
in
an
early
marriage
if
he
would
marry
becomingly
then
might
everything
still
be
made
pleasant
if
his
son
would
marry
becomingly
nothing
which
a
father
could
do
should
be
wanting
to
add
splendour
and
dignity
to
his
son
life
in
thinking
of
all
this
he
had
by
no
means
regarded
his
own
mode
of
life
with
favour
he
knew
how
jejune
his
life
had
been
how
devoid
of
other
interests
than
that
of
the
public
service
to
which
he
had
devoted
himself
he
was
thinking
of
this
when
he
told
his
son
that
he
had
neither
ploughed
and
sowed
or
been
the
owner
of
sheep
or
oxen
he
often
thought
of
this
when
he
heard
those
around
him
talking
of
the
sports
which
though
he
condemned
them
as
the
employments
of
a
life
he
now
regarded
wistfully
hopelessly
as
far
as
he
himself
was
concerned
as
proper
recreations
for
a
man
of
wealth
silverbridge
should
have
it
all
if
he
could
arrange
it
the
one
thing
necessary
was
a
fitting
wife
and
the
fitting
wife
had
been
absolutely
chosen
by
silverbridge
himself
it
may
be
conceived
therefore
that
he
was
again
unhappy
he
had
already
been
driven
to
acknowledge
that
these
children
of
his
thoughtless
restless
though
they
seemed
to
be
still
had
a
will
of
their
own
in
all
which
how
like
they
were
to
their
mother
with
her
however
his
word
though
it
might
be
resisted
had
never
lost
its
authority
when
he
had
declared
that
a
thing
should
not
be
done
she
had
never
persisted
in
saying
that
she
would
do
it
but
with
his
children
it
was
otherwise
what
power
had
he
over
silverbridge
or
for
the
matter
of
that
even
over
his
daughter
they
had
only
to
be
firm
and
he
knew
that
he
must
be
conquered
i
thought
that
you
liked
her
silverbridge
had
said
to
him
how
utterly
unconscious
thought
the
duke
must
the
young
man
have
been
of
all
that
his
position
required
of
him
when
he
used
such
an
argument
liked
her
he
did
like
her
she
was
clever
accomplished
beautiful
as
far
as
he
knew
endowed
with
all
good
qualities
would
not
many
an
old
roman
have
said
as
much
for
some
favourite
greek
slave
for
some
freedman
whom
he
would
admit
to
his
very
heart
but
what
old
roman
ever
dreamed
of
giving
his
daughter
to
the
son
of
a
greek
bondsman
had
he
done
so
what
would
have
become
of
the
name
of
a
roman
citizen
and
was
it
not
his
duty
to
fortify
and
maintain
that
higher
smaller
more
precious
pinnacle
of
rank
on
which
fortune
had
placed
him
and
his
children
like
her
yes
he
liked
her
certainly
he
had
by
no
means
always
found
that
he
best
liked
the
companionship
of
his
own
order
he
had
liked
to
feel
around
him
the
free
battle
of
the
house
of
commons
he
liked
the
power
of
attack
and
defence
in
carrying
on
which
an
english
politician
cares
nothing
for
rank
he
liked
to
remember
that
the
son
of
any
tradesman
might
by
his
own
merits
become
a
peer
of
parliament
he
would
have
liked
to
think
that
his
son
should
share
all
these
tastes
with
him
yes
he
liked
isabel
boncassen
but
how
different
was
that
liking
from
a
desire
that
she
should
be
bone
of
his
bone
and
flesh
of
his
flesh
chapter
lxii
the
brake
country
what
does
your
father
mean
to
do
about
trumpington
wood
that
was
the
first
word
from
lord
chiltern
after
he
had
shaken
hands
with
his
guest
is
it
all
right
yet
all
right
no
how
can
a
wood
like
that
be
all
right
without
a
man
about
the
place
who
knows
anything
of
the
nature
of
a
fox
in
your
grandfather
time
my
you
mean
well
your
they
used
to
trap
the
foxes
there
there
was
a
fellow
named
fothergill
who
used
to
come
there
for
shooting
now
it
is
worse
than
ever
nobody
shoots
there
because
there
is
nothing
to
shoot
there
is
a
keeper
every
scamp
is
allowed
to
go
where
he
pleases
and
of
course
there
is
a
fox
in
the
whole
place
my
huntsman
laughs
at
me
when
i
ask
him
to
draw
it
as
the
indignant
master
of
the
brake
hounds
said
this
the
very
fire
flashed
from
his
eyes
my
dear
said
lady
chiltern
expostulating
lord
silverbridge
has
been
in
the
house
above
half
an
hour
what
does
that
matter
when
a
thing
has
to
be
said
it
had
better
be
said
at
once
phineas
finn
was
staying
at
harrington
with
his
intimate
friends
the
chilterns
as
were
also
a
certain
and
maule
both
of
whom
were
addicted
to
hunting
the
lady
whose
maiden
name
had
been
palliser
being
a
cousin
to
lord
silverbridge
on
that
day
also
a
certain
and
spooner
dined
at
harrington
and
spooner
were
both
very
much
given
to
hunting
as
seemed
to
be
necessarily
the
case
with
everybody
admitted
to
that
house
spooner
was
a
gentleman
who
might
be
on
the
wrong
side
of
fifty
with
a
red
nose
very
vigorous
and
submissive
in
regard
to
all
things
but
his
wife
was
perhaps
something
more
than
half
his
age
a
stout
handsome
woman
she
had
been
the
penniless
daughter
of
a
retired
officer
but
yet
had
managed
to
ride
on
whatever
animal
any
one
would
lend
her
then
spooner
who
had
for
many
years
been
part
and
parcel
of
the
brake
hunt
and
who
was
much
in
want
of
a
wife
had
luckily
for
her
cast
his
eyes
upon
miss
leatherside
it
was
thought
that
upon
the
whole
she
made
him
a
good
wife
she
hunted
four
days
a
week
and
he
could
afford
to
keep
horses
for
her
she
never
flirted
and
wanted
no
one
to
open
gates
tom
spooner
himself
was
not
always
so
forward
as
he
used
to
be
but
his
wife
was
always
there
and
would
tell
him
all
that
he
did
not
see
himself
and
she
was
a
good
housewife
taking
care
that
nothing
should
be
spent
lavishly
except
upon
the
stable
of
him
too
and
of
his
health
she
was
careful
never
scrupling
to
say
a
word
in
season
when
he
was
likely
to
hurt
himself
either
among
the
fences
or
among
the
decanters
you
ai
so
young
as
you
were
tom
do
think
of
doing
it
this
she
would
say
to
him
with
a
loud
voice
when
she
would
find
him
pausing
at
a
fence
then
she
would
hop
over
herself
and
he
would
go
round
she
was
quite
a
providence
to
him
as
her
mother
old
leatherside
would
say
she
was
hardly
the
woman
that
one
would
have
expected
to
meet
as
a
friend
in
the
of
lady
chiltern
lord
chiltern
was
perhaps
a
little
rough
but
lady
chiltern
was
all
that
a
mother
a
wife
and
a
lady
ought
to
be
she
probably
felt
that
some
little
apology
ought
to
be
made
for
spooner
i
hope
you
like
hunting
she
said
to
silverbridge
best
of
all
things
said
he
enthusiastically
because
you
know
this
is
castle
nimrod
in
which
nothing
is
allowed
to
interfere
with
the
one
great
business
of
life
it
like
that
is
it
quite
like
that
lord
chiltern
has
taken
up
hunting
as
his
duty
in
life
and
he
does
it
with
his
might
and
main
not
to
have
a
good
day
is
a
misery
to
him
not
for
himself
but
because
he
feels
that
he
is
responsible
we
had
one
blank
day
last
year
and
i
thought
that
he
never
would
recover
it
it
was
that
unfortunate
trumpington
wood
how
he
will
hate
me
not
if
you
will
praise
the
hounds
judiciously
and
then
there
is
a
spooner
coming
here
he
is
the
he
understands
all
about
the
foxes
and
all
about
the
farmers
he
has
got
a
wife
does
she
understand
anything
she
understands
him
she
is
coming
too
they
have
not
been
married
long
and
he
never
goes
anywhere
without
her
does
she
ride
well
yes
i
never
go
out
myself
now
because
i
have
so
much
of
it
all
at
home
but
i
fancy
she
does
ride
a
good
deal
she
will
talk
hunting
too
if
chiltern
were
to
leave
the
country
i
think
they
ought
to
make
her
master
perhaps
you
think
her
rather
odd
but
really
she
is
a
very
good
woman
i
am
sure
i
shall
like
her
i
hope
you
will
you
know
finn
he
is
here
he
and
my
husband
are
very
old
friends
and
adelaide
maule
is
your
cousin
she
hunts
too
and
so
does
maule
only
not
quite
so
energetically
i
think
that
is
all
we
shall
have
immediately
after
that
all
the
guests
came
in
at
once
and
a
discussion
was
heard
as
they
were
passing
through
the
hall
no
that
was
it
said
spooner
loudly
i
do
care
what
dick
said
dick
rabbit
was
the
first
whip
and
seemed
to
have
been
much
exercised
with
the
matter
now
under
dispute
the
fox
never
went
into
grobby
gorse
at
all
i
was
there
and
saw
sappho
give
him
a
line
down
the
bank
i
think
he
must
have
gone
into
the
gorse
my
dear
said
her
husband
the
earth
was
open
you
know
i
tell
you
she
did
you
were
there
and
you
ca
know
sure
it
was
a
vixen
by
her
running
we
ought
to
have
killed
that
fox
my
lord
then
spooner
made
her
obeisance
to
her
hostess
perhaps
she
was
rather
slow
in
doing
this
but
the
greatness
of
the
subject
had
been
the
cause
these
are
matters
so
important
that
the
ordinary
civilities
of
the
world
should
not
stand
in
their
way
what
do
you
say
chiltern
asked
the
husband
i
say
that
spooner
is
very
often
wrong
and
that
dick
rabbit
is
very
often
right
about
a
fox
it
was
a
pretty
run
said
phineas
just
minutes
said
spooner
up
to
grobby
gorse
asserted
spooner
the
hounds
never
hunted
a
yard
after
that
dick
hurried
them
into
the
gorse
and
the
old
hound
would
stick
to
his
line
when
she
found
that
no
one
believed
her
this
was
on
a
monday
evening
and
the
brake
hounds
went
out
generally
five
days
a
week
you
hunt
i
suppose
lady
chiltern
said
to
silverbridge
i
hope
so
you
must
hunt
indeed
there
is
nothing
else
to
do
chiltern
has
taken
such
a
dislike
to
that
he
shoot
pheasants
himself
we
do
hunt
on
wednesdays
or
sundays
and
then
everybody
lies
in
bed
here
is
maule
he
lies
in
bed
on
other
mornings
as
well
and
spends
the
rest
of
his
day
riding
about
the
country
looking
for
the
hounds
does
he
ever
find
them
what
did
become
of
you
all
said
maule
as
he
took
his
place
at
the
you
ca
have
drawn
any
of
the
coverts
regularly
then
we
found
our
foxes
without
drawing
them
said
the
master
we
chopped
one
at
bromleys
said
spooner
i
went
there
then
you
ought
to
have
known
better
said
spooner
when
a
man
loses
the
hounds
in
that
country
he
ought
to
go
direct
to
wood
if
you
had
come
on
to
brackett
you
have
seen
as
good
a
minutes
as
ever
you
wished
to
ride
when
the
ladies
went
out
of
the
room
spooner
gave
a
parting
word
of
advice
to
her
husband
and
to
the
host
now
tom
do
you
drink
lord
chiltern
look
after
him
and
do
let
him
have
then
there
began
an
altogether
different
phase
of
hunting
conversation
as
long
as
the
ladies
were
there
it
was
all
very
well
to
talk
of
hunting
as
an
amusement
good
sport
a
thirty
minutes
or
so
the
delight
of
having
a
friend
in
a
ditch
or
the
glory
of
a
rail
were
fitting
subjects
for
a
lighter
hour
but
now
the
business
of
the
night
was
to
begin
the
difficulties
the
enmities
the
precautions
the
resolutions
the
resources
of
the
brake
hunt
were
to
be
discussed
and
from
thence
the
conversation
of
these
devotees
strayed
away
to
the
perils
at
large
to
which
hunting
in
these
modern
days
is
subjected
not
the
perils
of
broken
necks
and
crushed
ribs
which
can
be
reduced
to
an
average
and
so
an
end
made
of
that
small
matter
but
the
perils
from
outsiders
the
perils
from
prejudices
the
perils
from
more
modern
sports
the
perils
from
the
perils
from
extended
population
the
perils
from
increasing
railroads
the
perils
from
literary
ignorances
the
perils
from
intruding
cads
the
perils
from
indifferent
magnates
the
duke
of
omnium
for
instance
and
that
peril
of
perils
the
peril
of
decrease
of
funds
and
increase
of
expenditure
the
jaunty
gentleman
who
puts
on
his
dainty
breeches
and
his
pair
of
boots
and
on
his
single
horse
rides
out
on
a
pleasant
morning
to
some
neighbouring
meet
thinking
himself
a
sportsman
has
but
a
faint
idea
of
the
troubles
which
a
few
staunch
workmen
endure
in
order
that
he
may
not
be
made
to
think
that
his
boots
and
his
breeches
and
his
horse
have
been
in
vain
a
word
or
two
further
was
at
first
said
about
that
unfortunate
wood
for
which
silverbridge
at
the
present
felt
himself
responsible
finn
said
that
he
was
sure
the
duke
would
look
to
it
if
silverbridge
would
mention
it
chiltern
simply
groaned
silverbridge
said
nothing
remembering
how
many
troubles
he
had
on
hand
at
this
moment
then
by
degrees
their
solicitude
worked
itself
round
to
the
cares
of
a
neighbouring
hunt
the
had
lost
their
master
one
captain
glomax
was
going
and
the
county
had
been
driven
to
the
necessity
of
advertising
for
a
successor
when
hunting
comes
to
that
said
lord
chiltern
one
begins
to
think
that
it
is
in
a
bad
way
it
may
always
be
observed
that
when
speak
seriously
of
their
sport
they
speak
despondingly
everything
is
going
wrong
perhaps
the
same
thing
may
be
remarked
in
other
pursuits
farmers
are
generally
on
the
verge
of
ruin
trade
is
always
bad
the
church
is
in
danger
the
house
of
lords
is
worth
a
dozen
years
purchase
the
throne
totters
an
itinerant
master
with
a
never
can
carry
on
a
country
said
spooner
you
ought
really
to
have
a
gentleman
of
property
in
the
county
said
lord
chiltern
in
a
tone
his
father
acres
lay
elsewhere
it
should
be
someone
who
has
a
real
stake
in
the
country
replied
spooner
whom
the
farmers
can
respect
glomax
understood
hunting
no
doubt
but
the
farmers
did
care
for
him
if
you
have
the
farmers
with
you
you
ca
have
hunting
then
he
filled
a
glass
of
port
if
you
do
approve
of
glomax
what
do
you
think
of
a
man
like
major
tifto
asked
maule
that
was
in
the
runnymede
said
spooner
contemptuously
who
is
major
tifto
asked
lord
chiltern
he
is
the
man
said
silverbridge
boldly
who
owned
prime
minister
with
me
when
he
did
win
the
leger
last
september
there
was
a
deuce
of
a
row
said
maule
then
spooner
who
read
his
bell
life
and
field
very
religiously
and
who
never
missed
an
article
in
bayley
proceeded
to
give
them
an
account
of
everything
that
had
taken
place
in
the
runnymede
hunt
it
mattered
but
little
that
he
was
wrong
in
all
his
details
narrations
always
are
the
result
to
which
he
came
was
nearly
right
when
he
declared
that
the
major
had
been
turned
off
that
a
committee
had
been
appointed
and
that
topps
and
jawstock
had
been
threatened
with
a
lawsuit
that
comes
said
lord
chiltern
solemnly
of
employing
men
like
major
tifto
in
places
for
which
they
are
radically
unfit
i
dare
say
major
tifto
knew
how
to
handle
a
pack
of
hounds
perhaps
almost
as
well
as
my
huntsman
fowler
but
i
do
think
a
county
would
get
on
very
well
which
appointed
fowler
master
of
hounds
he
is
an
honest
man
and
therefore
would
be
better
than
tifto
but
it
would
not
do
it
is
a
position
in
which
a
man
should
at
any
rate
be
a
gentleman
if
he
be
not
all
those
who
should
be
concerned
in
maintaining
the
hunt
will
turn
their
backs
upon
him
when
i
take
my
hounds
over
this
ground
and
that
man
ground
certainly
without
doing
him
any
good
i
have
to
think
of
a
great
many
things
i
have
to
understand
that
those
whom
i
can
not
compensate
by
money
i
have
to
compensate
by
courtesy
when
i
shake
hands
with
a
farmer
and
express
my
obligation
to
him
because
he
does
not
lock
his
gates
he
is
gratified
i
think
any
decent
farmer
would
care
much
for
shaking
hands
with
major
tifto
if
we
fall
into
that
kind
of
thing
there
must
soon
be
an
end
of
hunting
major
tiftos
are
cheap
no
doubt
but
in
hunting
as
in
most
other
things
cheap
and
nasty
go
together
if
men
do
choose
to
put
their
hands
in
their
pockets
they
had
better
say
so
and
give
the
thing
up
altogether
if
you
wo
take
any
more
wine
we
go
to
the
ladies
silverbridge
the
trap
will
start
from
the
door
morning
precisely
at
grantingham
cross
is
fourteen
miles
then
they
all
left
their
chairs
but
as
they
did
so
spooner
finished
the
bottle
of
i
never
heard
chiltern
speak
so
much
like
a
book
before
said
spooner
to
his
wife
as
she
drove
him
home
that
night
the
next
morning
everybody
was
ready
for
a
start
at
nine
except
maule
as
to
whom
his
wife
declared
that
she
had
left
him
in
bed
when
she
came
down
to
breakfast
he
can
never
get
there
if
we
do
take
him
said
lord
chiltern
who
was
in
truth
the
most
man
in
the
world
five
minutes
were
allowed
him
and
then
he
came
down
with
a
large
sandwich
in
one
hand
and
a
in
the
other
with
which
he
was
prepared
to
complete
his
toilet
what
the
deuce
makes
you
always
in
such
a
hurry
were
the
first
words
he
spoke
as
lord
chiltern
got
on
the
box
the
master
knew
him
too
well
to
argue
the
point
well
he
always
is
in
a
hurry
said
the
sinner
when
his
wife
accused
him
of
ingratitude
where
spooner
asked
the
master
when
he
saw
spooner
without
her
husband
at
the
meet
i
knew
how
it
would
be
when
i
saw
the
she
said
in
a
whisper
that
could
be
heard
all
round
he
has
got
it
this
time
sharp
in
his
great
toe
we
sha
find
at
grantingham
they
were
cutting
wood
there
last
week
if
i
were
you
my
lord
i
go
away
to
the
spinnies
at
once
i
must
draw
the
country
regularly
muttered
the
master
the
country
was
drawn
regularly
but
in
vain
till
about
two
not
only
was
there
no
fox
at
grantingham
wood
but
none
even
at
the
spinnies
and
at
two
fowler
with
an
anxious
face
held
a
consultation
with
his
more
anxious
master
trumpington
wood
lay
on
their
right
and
that
no
doubt
would
have
been
the
proper
draw
i
suppose
we
must
try
it
said
lord
chiltern
old
fowler
looked
very
sour
you
might
as
well
look
for
a
fox
under
my
wife
bed
my
lord
i
dare
say
we
should
find
one
there
said
one
of
the
wags
of
the
hunt
fowler
shook
his
head
feeling
that
this
was
no
time
for
joking
it
ought
to
be
drawn
said
chiltern
of
course
you
know
best
my
lord
i
would
touch
it
never
no
more
let
all
know
what
the
duke
wood
is
this
is
lord
silverbridge
the
duke
son
said
chiltern
laughing
i
beg
your
lordship
pardon
said
fowler
taking
off
his
cap
we
shall
have
a
good
time
coming
some
day
let
me
trot
off
to
michaelmas
daisies
my
lord
i
be
there
in
thirty
minutes
in
the
neighbouring
parish
of
michael
de
dezier
there
was
a
favourite
little
gorse
which
among
had
acquired
this
unreasonable
name
after
a
little
consideration
the
master
yielded
and
away
they
trotted
you
cross
the
ford
fowler
asked
spooner
oh
yes
we
could
draw
the
daisies
this
afternoon
if
we
did
it
be
up
to
the
horses
bellies
those
who
do
like
it
can
go
round
they
never
be
there
in
time
fowler
there
a
many
as
do
mind
that
you
wo
be
one
to
stay
behind
the
water
was
up
to
the
horses
bellies
but
nevertheless
spooner
was
at
the
gorse
side
when
the
daisies
were
drawn
they
found
and
were
away
in
a
minute
it
was
all
done
so
quickly
that
fowler
who
had
alone
gone
into
the
gorse
had
hardly
time
to
get
out
with
his
hounds
the
fox
ran
right
back
as
though
he
were
making
for
the
duke
pernicious
wood
in
the
first
field
or
two
there
was
a
succession
of
gates
and
there
was
not
much
to
do
in
the
way
of
jumping
then
the
fox
keeping
straight
ahead
deviated
from
the
line
by
which
they
had
come
making
for
the
brook
by
a
more
direct
course
the
ruck
of
the
horsemen
understanding
the
matter
very
well
left
the
hounds
and
went
to
the
right
riding
for
the
ford
the
ford
was
of
such
a
nature
that
but
one
horse
could
pass
it
at
a
time
and
that
one
had
to
scramble
through
deep
mud
there
be
the
devil
to
pay
there
said
lord
chiltern
going
straight
with
his
hounds
phineas
finn
and
dick
rabbit
were
close
after
him
old
fowler
had
craftily
gone
to
the
ford
but
spooner
who
did
not
intend
to
be
shaken
off
followed
the
master
and
close
with
her
was
lord
silverbridge
lord
chiltern
has
got
it
right
she
said
he
ca
do
it
among
these
bushes
as
she
spoke
the
master
put
his
horse
at
the
bushes
and
then
disappeared
the
lady
had
been
right
there
was
no
ground
at
that
spot
to
take
off
from
and
the
bushes
had
impeded
him
lord
chiltern
got
over
but
his
horse
was
in
the
water
dick
rabbit
and
poor
phineas
finn
were
stopped
in
their
course
by
the
necessity
of
helping
the
master
in
his
trouble
but
spooner
the
judicious
spooner
rode
at
the
stream
where
it
was
indeed
a
little
wider
but
at
a
place
in
which
the
horse
could
see
what
he
was
about
and
where
he
could
jump
from
and
to
firm
ground
lord
silverbridge
followed
her
gallantly
they
both
jumped
the
brook
well
and
then
were
together
you
beat
me
in
pace
said
the
lady
as
he
rode
alongside
of
her
take
the
fence
ahead
straight
and
then
turn
sharp
to
your
right
with
all
her
faults
spooner
was
a
thorough
sportsman
he
did
take
the
fence
ahead
or
rather
tried
to
do
so
it
was
a
bank
and
a
double
ditch
not
very
great
in
itself
but
requiring
a
horse
to
land
on
the
top
and
go
off
with
a
second
spring
our
young
friend
nag
not
quite
understanding
the
nature
of
the
impediment
endeavoured
to
swallow
it
whole
as
men
say
and
came
down
in
the
further
ditch
silverbridge
came
down
on
his
head
but
the
horse
pursued
his
course
across
a
field
this
was
very
disagreeable
he
was
not
in
the
least
hurt
but
it
became
his
duty
to
run
after
his
horse
a
very
few
furrows
of
that
work
suffice
to
make
a
man
think
that
hunting
altogether
is
a
beastly
sort
of
thing
spooner
horse
who
had
shown
himself
to
be
a
little
less
quick
of
foot
than
his
own
had
known
all
about
the
bank
and
the
double
ditch
and
had
apparently
of
his
own
accord
turned
down
to
the
right
either
seeing
or
hearing
the
hounds
and
knowing
that
the
ploughed
ground
was
to
be
avoided
but
his
rider
soon
changed
his
course
she
went
straight
after
the
riderless
horse
and
when
silverbridge
had
reduced
himself
to
utter
speechlessness
by
his
exertions
brought
him
back
his
steed
i
am
i
am
i
am
so
sorry
he
struggled
to
say
and
then
as
she
held
his
horse
for
him
he
struggled
up
into
the
saddle
keep
down
this
furrow
said
spooner
and
we
shall
be
with
them
in
the
second
field
there
nobody
near
them
yet
chapter
lxiii
i
seen
like
that
before
on
this
occasion
silverbridge
stayed
only
a
few
days
at
harrington
having
promised
tregear
to
entertain
him
at
the
baldfaced
stag
it
was
here
that
his
horses
were
standing
and
he
now
intended
by
limiting
himself
to
one
horse
a
day
to
mount
his
friend
for
a
couple
of
weeks
it
was
settled
at
last
that
tregear
should
ride
his
friend
horse
one
day
hire
the
next
and
so
on
i
wonder
what
you
think
of
mrs
spooner
he
said
why
should
i
think
anything
of
her
because
i
doubt
whether
you
ever
saw
such
a
woman
before
she
does
nothing
but
hunt
then
i
certainly
sha
want
to
see
her
again
and
she
talks
as
i
never
heard
a
lady
talk
before
then
i
do
care
if
i
never
see
her
at
all
but
she
is
the
most
plucky
and
most
human
being
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
after
all
hunting
is
very
good
fun
very
if
you
do
do
it
so
often
as
to
be
sick
of
it
long
as
i
have
known
you
i
do
think
i
ever
saw
you
ride
yet
we
used
to
have
hunting
down
in
cornwall
and
thought
we
did
it
pretty
well
and
i
have
ridden
in
south
wales
which
i
can
assure
you
is
an
easy
thing
to
do
but
you
must
expect
much
from
me
they
were
both
out
the
monday
and
tuesday
in
that
week
and
then
again
on
the
thursday
without
anything
special
in
the
way
of
sport
lord
chiltern
who
had
found
silverbridge
to
be
a
young
man
after
his
own
heart
was
anxious
that
he
should
come
back
to
harrington
and
bring
tregear
with
him
but
to
this
tregear
would
not
assent
alleging
that
he
should
feel
himself
to
be
a
burden
both
to
lord
and
lady
chiltern
on
the
friday
tregear
did
not
go
out
saying
that
he
would
avoid
the
expense
and
on
that
day
there
was
a
good
run
it
is
always
the
way
said
silverbridge
if
you
miss
a
day
it
is
sure
to
be
the
best
thing
of
the
season
an
hour
and
a
quarter
with
hardly
anything
you
could
call
a
check
it
is
the
only
very
good
thing
i
have
seen
since
i
have
been
here
spooner
was
with
them
all
through
and
i
suppose
you
were
with
mrs
spooner
i
was
far
off
i
wish
you
had
been
there
on
the
next
day
the
meet
was
at
the
kennels
close
to
harrington
and
silverbridge
drove
his
friend
over
in
a
gig
the
master
and
lady
chiltern
spooner
and
spooner
maule
and
maule
phineas
finn
and
a
host
of
others
condoled
with
the
unfortunate
young
man
because
he
had
not
seen
the
good
thing
yesterday
we
had
it
a
little
faster
once
or
twice
said
spooner
with
deliberation
but
never
for
so
long
then
it
was
straight
as
a
line
and
a
real
open
kill
no
changing
you
know
we
did
go
through
the
daisies
but
i
swear
to
its
being
the
same
fox
all
of
which
set
tregear
wondering
how
could
she
swear
to
her
fox
and
if
they
had
changed
what
did
it
matter
and
if
it
had
been
a
little
crooked
why
would
it
have
been
less
enjoyable
and
was
she
really
so
exact
a
judge
of
pace
as
she
pretended
to
be
i
afraid
we
sha
have
anything
like
that
she
continued
the
wind
in
the
west
and
i
never
do
like
a
westerly
wind
a
little
to
the
north
said
her
husband
looking
round
the
compass
my
dear
said
the
lady
you
never
know
where
the
wind
comes
from
now
do
you
think
of
taking
off
your
comforter
i
wo
have
it
tregear
was
riding
his
friend
favourite
hunter
a
thoroughbred
bay
horse
very
much
more
than
up
to
his
rider
weight
and
supposed
to
be
peculiarly
good
at
timber
water
or
any
kind
of
fence
however
high
or
however
broad
they
found
at
a
covert
near
the
kennels
and
killed
their
fox
after
a
burst
of
a
few
minutes
they
found
again
and
having
lost
their
fox
all
declared
that
there
was
not
a
yard
of
scent
i
always
know
what
a
west
wind
means
said
spooner
then
they
lunched
and
smoked
and
trotted
about
with
an
apparent
acknowledgement
that
there
was
much
to
be
done
it
was
not
right
that
they
should
expect
much
after
so
good
a
thing
as
they
had
had
yesterday
at
two
spooner
had
been
sent
home
by
his
providence
and
spooner
was
calculating
that
she
would
be
able
to
ride
her
horse
again
on
the
tuesday
when
on
a
sudden
the
hounds
were
on
a
fox
it
turned
out
afterwards
that
dick
rabbit
had
absolutely
ridden
him
up
among
the
stubble
and
that
the
hounds
had
nearly
killed
him
before
he
had
gone
a
yard
but
the
astute
animal
making
the
best
use
of
his
legs
till
he
could
get
the
advantage
of
the
first
ditch
ran
and
crept
and
jumped
absolutely
through
the
pack
then
there
was
shouting
and
yelling
and
riding
the
men
who
were
idly
smoking
threw
away
their
cigars
those
who
were
loitering
at
a
distance
lost
their
chance
but
the
real
sportsmen
always
on
the
alert
always
thinking
of
the
business
in
hand
always
mindful
that
there
may
be
at
any
moment
a
fox
just
before
the
hounds
had
a
glorious
opportunity
of
getting
well
away
among
these
no
one
was
more
intent
or
when
the
moment
came
better
away
than
spooner
silverbridge
had
been
talking
to
her
and
had
the
full
advantage
of
her
care
tregear
was
riding
behind
with
lord
chiltern
who
had
been
pressing
him
to
come
with
his
friend
to
harrington
as
soon
as
the
shouting
was
heard
chiltern
was
off
like
a
rocket
it
was
not
only
that
he
was
anxious
to
get
well
away
but
that
a
sense
of
duty
compelled
him
to
see
how
the
thing
was
being
done
old
fowler
certainly
was
a
little
slow
and
dick
rabbit
with
the
true
instinct
of
a
whip
was
a
little
apt
to
bustle
a
fox
back
into
covert
and
then
when
a
run
commences
with
a
fast
rush
riders
are
apt
to
the
hounds
and
then
the
hounds
will
the
fox
all
of
which
has
to
be
seen
to
by
a
master
who
knows
his
business
tregear
followed
and
being
mounted
on
a
fast
horse
was
soon
as
forward
as
a
judicious
rider
would
desire
now
runks
do
you
press
on
and
spoil
it
all
said
spooner
to
the
objectionable
son
of
old
runks
the
vet
from
rufford
but
young
runks
did
press
on
till
the
master
spoke
a
word
the
word
shall
not
be
repeated
but
it
was
efficacious
at
that
moment
there
had
been
a
check
as
there
is
generally
after
a
short
spurt
when
fox
hounds
and
horsemen
get
off
together
and
not
always
in
the
order
in
which
they
have
been
placed
here
there
is
too
much
bustle
and
the
pack
becomes
disconcerted
but
it
enabled
fowler
to
get
up
and
by
dint
of
growling
at
the
men
and
conciliating
his
hounds
he
soon
picked
up
the
scent
if
they
all
stand
still
for
two
minutes
and
be
to
them
he
muttered
aloud
to
himself
they
to
ride
arter
they
might
go
then
and
some
of
soon
be
nowhere
but
in
spite
of
fowler
denunciations
there
was
of
course
another
rush
runks
had
slunk
away
but
by
making
a
little
distance
was
now
again
ahead
of
the
hounds
and
unfortunately
there
was
with
him
lord
chiltern
was
very
wrath
when
he
like
that
said
spooner
to
tregear
it
always
well
to
give
him
a
wide
berth
but
as
the
hounds
were
now
running
fast
it
was
necessary
that
even
in
taking
this
precaution
due
regard
should
be
had
to
the
fox
line
he
back
for
harrington
bushes
said
spooner
and
as
she
said
so
she
rode
at
a
bank
with
a
rail
at
the
top
of
it
perhaps
a
high
with
a
deep
drop
into
the
field
beyond
it
was
not
a
very
nice
place
but
it
was
apparently
the
only
available
spot
in
the
fence
she
seemed
to
know
it
well
for
as
she
got
close
to
it
she
brought
her
horse
almost
to
a
stand
and
so
took
it
the
horse
cleared
the
rail
seemed
just
to
touch
the
bank
on
the
other
side
while
she
threw
herself
back
almost
on
to
his
crupper
and
so
came
down
with
perfect
ease
but
she
knowing
that
it
would
not
be
easy
to
all
horses
paused
a
moment
to
see
what
would
happen
tregear
was
next
to
her
and
was
intending
to
fly
the
fence
but
when
he
saw
spooner
pull
her
horse
and
pause
he
also
had
to
pull
his
horse
this
he
did
so
as
to
enable
her
to
take
her
leap
without
danger
or
encumbrance
from
him
but
hardly
so
as
to
bring
his
horse
to
the
bank
in
the
same
way
it
may
be
doubted
whether
the
animal
he
was
riding
would
have
known
enough
and
been
quiet
enough
to
have
performed
the
acrobatic
manoeuvre
which
had
carried
spooner
so
pleasantly
over
the
peril
he
had
some
idea
of
this
for
the
thought
occurred
to
him
that
he
would
turn
and
ride
fast
at
the
jump
but
before
he
could
turn
he
saw
that
silverbridge
was
pressing
on
him
it
was
thus
his
only
resource
to
do
as
spooner
had
done
he
was
too
close
to
the
rail
but
still
he
tried
it
the
horse
attempted
to
jump
caught
his
foot
against
the
bar
and
of
course
went
over
this
probably
would
have
been
nothing
had
not
silverbridge
with
his
rushing
beast
been
immediately
after
them
when
the
young
lord
saw
that
his
friend
was
down
it
was
too
late
for
him
to
stop
his
course
his
horse
was
determined
to
have
the
fence
and
did
have
it
he
touched
nothing
and
would
have
skimmed
in
glory
over
the
next
field
had
he
not
come
right
down
on
tregear
and
tregear
steed
there
they
were
four
of
them
two
men
and
two
horses
in
one
confused
heap
the
first
person
with
them
was
spooner
who
was
off
her
horse
in
a
minute
and
silverbridge
too
was
very
soon
on
his
legs
he
at
any
rate
was
unhurt
and
the
two
horses
were
up
before
spooner
was
out
of
her
saddle
but
tregear
did
not
move
what
are
we
to
do
said
lord
silverbridge
kneeling
down
over
his
friend
oh
spooner
what
are
we
to
do
the
hunt
had
passed
on
and
no
one
else
was
immediately
with
them
but
at
this
moment
dick
rabbit
who
had
been
left
behind
to
bring
up
his
hounds
appeared
above
the
bank
leave
your
horse
and
come
down
said
spooner
here
is
a
gentleman
who
has
hurt
himself
dick
would
leave
his
horse
but
was
soon
on
the
scene
having
found
his
way
through
another
part
of
the
fence
no
he
ai
dead
said
dick
i
seen
like
that
before
and
they
wur
dead
but
he
had
a
hawful
squeege
then
he
passed
his
hand
over
the
man
neck
and
chest
there
a
lot
of
is
broke
said
he
we
must
get
him
into
farmer
tooby
after
awhile
he
was
got
into
farmer
tooby
when
that
surgeon
came
who
is
always
in
attendance
on
a
the
surgeon
declared
that
he
had
broken
his
two
of
his
ribs
and
his
left
arm
and
then
one
of
the
animals
had
struck
him
on
the
chest
as
he
raised
himself
a
little
brandy
was
poured
down
his
throat
but
even
under
that
operation
he
gave
no
sign
of
life
no
missis
he
dead
said
dick
to
tooby
no
more
he
wo
die
this
bout
but
he
got
it
very
nasty
that
night
silverbridge
was
sitting
by
his
friend
bedside
at
ten
in
lord
chiltern
house
tregear
had
spoken
a
few
words
and
the
bones
had
been
set
but
the
doctor
had
not
felt
himself
justified
in
speaking
with
that
assurance
which
dick
had
expressed
the
whole
body
had
been
bruised
by
the
horse
which
had
fallen
on
him
the
agony
of
silverbridge
was
extreme
for
he
knew
that
it
had
been
his
doing
you
were
a
little
too
close
spooner
had
said
to
him
but
nobody
saw
it
and
we
hold
our
tongues
silverbridge
however
would
not
hold
his
tongue
he
told
everybody
how
it
had
happened
how
he
had
been
unable
to
stop
his
horse
how
he
had
jumped
upon
his
friend
and
perhaps
killed
him
i
do
know
what
i
am
to
do
i
am
so
miserable
he
said
to
lady
chiltern
with
the
tears
running
down
his
face
the
two
remained
at
harrington
and
their
luggage
was
brought
over
from
the
baldfaced
stag
the
accident
had
happened
on
a
saturday
on
the
sunday
there
was
no
comfort
on
the
monday
the
recollection
and
mind
were
and
the
doctor
thought
that
perhaps
with
great
care
his
constitution
would
pull
him
through
on
that
day
the
consternation
at
harrington
was
so
great
that
spooner
would
not
go
to
the
meet
she
came
over
from
spoon
hall
and
spent
a
considerable
part
of
the
day
in
the
sick
room
it
sure
to
come
right
if
it
above
the
vitals
she
said
expressing
an
opinion
which
had
come
from
much
experience
that
is
she
added
unless
the
neck
broke
when
poor
old
jack
stubbs
drove
his
head
into
his
cap
and
dislocated
his
wertebury
of
course
it
was
all
up
with
him
the
patient
heard
this
and
was
seen
to
smile
on
the
tuesday
there
arose
the
question
of
family
communication
as
the
accident
would
make
its
way
into
the
papers
a
message
had
been
sent
to
polwenning
to
say
that
various
bones
had
been
broken
but
that
the
patient
was
upon
the
whole
doing
well
then
there
had
been
different
messages
backwards
and
forwards
in
all
of
which
there
had
been
an
attempt
to
comfort
old
tregear
but
on
the
tuesday
letters
were
written
silverbridge
sitting
in
his
friend
room
sent
a
long
account
of
the
accident
to
tregear
giving
a
list
of
the
injuries
done
your
sister
whispered
the
poor
fellow
from
his
pillow
yes
yes
yes
i
will
and
mabel
grex
silverbridge
nodded
assent
and
again
went
to
the
he
did
write
to
his
sister
and
in
plain
words
told
her
everything
the
doctor
says
he
is
not
now
in
danger
then
he
added
a
postscript
as
long
as
i
am
here
i
will
let
you
know
how
he
is
chapter
lxiv
i
believe
him
to
be
a
worthy
young
man
lady
mary
and
finn
were
alone
when
the
tidings
came
from
silverbridge
the
duke
had
been
absent
having
gone
to
spend
an
unpleasant
week
in
barsetshire
mary
had
taken
the
opportunity
of
his
absence
to
discuss
her
own
prospects
at
full
length
my
dear
said
finn
i
will
not
express
an
opinion
how
can
i
after
all
that
has
passed
i
have
told
the
duke
the
same
i
can
not
be
heart
and
hand
with
either
without
being
false
to
the
other
but
still
lady
mary
continued
to
talk
about
tregear
i
do
think
papa
has
a
right
to
treat
me
in
this
way
she
said
he
would
be
allowed
to
kill
me
and
this
is
killing
me
while
there
is
life
there
is
hope
said
finn
yes
while
there
is
life
there
is
hope
but
one
does
want
to
grow
old
first
there
is
no
danger
of
that
yet
mary
i
feel
very
old
what
is
the
use
of
life
without
something
to
make
it
sweet
i
am
not
even
allowed
to
hear
anything
that
he
is
doing
if
he
were
to
ask
me
i
think
i
would
go
away
with
him
he
would
not
be
foolish
enough
for
that
because
he
does
not
suffer
as
i
do
he
has
his
borough
and
his
public
life
and
a
hundred
things
to
think
of
i
have
got
nothing
but
him
i
know
he
is
true
quite
as
true
as
i
am
but
it
is
i
that
have
the
suffering
in
all
this
a
man
can
never
be
like
a
girl
papa
ought
not
to
make
me
suffer
like
this
that
took
place
on
the
monday
on
the
tuesday
finn
received
a
letter
from
her
husband
giving
his
account
of
the
accident
as
far
as
i
can
learn
he
said
silverbridge
will
write
about
it
then
he
went
on
to
give
a
by
no
means
good
account
of
the
state
of
the
patient
the
doctor
had
declared
him
to
be
out
of
immediate
danger
and
had
set
the
broken
bones
as
tidings
would
be
sent
on
the
next
day
she
had
better
say
nothing
about
the
accident
to
lady
mary
this
letter
reached
matching
on
tuesday
and
made
the
position
of
finn
very
disagreeable
she
was
bound
to
carry
herself
as
though
nothing
was
amiss
knowing
as
she
did
so
the
condition
of
mary
lover
on
the
evening
of
that
day
lady
mary
was
more
lively
than
usual
though
her
liveliness
was
hardly
of
a
happy
nature
i
do
know
what
papa
can
expect
i
heard
him
say
a
hundred
times
that
to
be
in
parliament
is
the
highest
place
a
gentleman
can
fill
and
now
frank
is
in
parliament
finn
looked
at
her
with
beseeching
eyes
as
though
begging
her
not
to
speak
of
tregear
and
then
to
think
of
their
having
that
lord
popplecourt
there
i
shall
always
hate
lady
cantrip
for
it
was
her
place
that
she
should
have
thought
it
possible
lord
popplecourt
such
a
creature
hyperion
to
a
satyr
is
it
true
oh
that
papa
should
have
thought
it
possible
then
she
got
up
and
walked
about
the
room
beating
her
hands
together
all
this
time
finn
knew
that
tregear
was
lying
at
harrington
with
half
his
bones
broken
and
in
danger
of
his
life
on
the
next
morning
lady
mary
received
her
letters
there
were
two
lying
before
her
plate
when
she
came
into
breakfast
one
from
her
father
and
the
other
from
silverbridge
she
read
that
from
the
duke
first
while
finn
was
watching
her
papa
will
be
home
on
saturday
she
said
he
declares
that
the
people
in
the
borough
are
quite
delighted
with
silverbridge
for
a
member
and
he
is
quite
jocose
used
to
be
delighted
with
me
once
he
says
i
suppose
everybody
changes
then
she
began
to
pour
out
the
tea
before
she
opened
her
brother
letter
finn
eyes
were
still
on
her
anxiously
i
wonder
what
silverbridge
has
got
to
say
about
the
brake
hunt
then
she
opened
her
letter
oh
oh
she
exclaimed
frank
has
killed
himself
killed
himself
not
that
it
is
not
so
bad
as
that
you
had
heard
it
before
how
is
he
mary
oh
heavens
i
can
not
read
it
do
you
read
it
tell
me
all
tell
me
the
truth
what
am
i
to
do
where
shall
i
go
then
she
threw
up
her
hands
and
with
a
loud
scream
fell
on
her
knees
with
her
head
upon
the
chair
in
the
next
moment
finn
was
down
beside
her
on
the
floor
read
it
why
do
you
not
read
it
if
you
will
not
read
it
give
it
to
me
finn
did
read
the
letter
which
was
very
short
but
still
giving
by
no
means
an
unfavourable
account
of
the
patient
i
am
sorry
to
say
he
has
broken
ever
so
many
bones
and
we
were
very
much
frightened
about
him
then
the
writer
went
into
details
from
which
a
reader
who
did
not
read
the
words
carefully
might
well
imagine
that
the
man
life
was
still
in
danger
finn
did
read
it
all
and
did
her
best
to
comfort
her
friend
it
has
been
a
bad
accident
she
said
but
it
is
clear
that
he
is
getting
better
men
do
so
often
break
their
bones
and
then
seem
to
think
nothing
of
it
afterwards
silverbridge
says
it
was
his
fault
what
does
he
mean
i
suppose
he
was
riding
too
close
to
tregear
and
that
they
came
down
together
of
course
it
is
distressing
but
i
do
not
think
you
need
make
yourself
positively
unhappy
about
it
would
you
not
be
unhappy
if
it
were
mr
finn
said
mary
jumping
up
from
her
knees
i
shall
go
to
him
i
should
go
mad
if
i
were
to
remain
here
and
know
nothing
about
it
but
what
silverbridge
will
tell
me
i
will
telegraph
to
mr
finn
finn
wo
care
men
are
so
heartless
they
write
about
each
other
just
as
though
it
did
not
signify
in
the
least
whether
anybody
were
dead
or
alive
i
shall
go
to
him
you
can
not
do
that
i
do
care
now
what
anybody
may
think
i
choose
to
be
considered
as
belonging
to
him
and
if
papa
were
here
i
would
say
the
same
it
was
of
course
not
difficult
to
make
her
understand
that
she
could
not
go
to
harrington
but
it
was
by
no
means
easy
to
keep
her
tranquil
she
would
send
a
telegram
herself
this
was
debated
for
a
long
time
till
at
last
lady
mary
insisted
that
she
was
not
subject
to
finn
authority
if
papa
were
here
even
then
i
would
send
it
and
she
did
send
it
in
her
own
name
regardless
of
the
fact
pointed
out
to
her
by
finn
that
the
people
at
the
would
thus
know
her
secret
it
is
no
secret
she
said
i
do
want
it
to
be
a
secret
the
telegram
went
in
the
following
words
i
have
heard
it
i
am
so
wretched
send
me
one
word
to
say
how
you
are
she
got
an
answer
back
with
tregear
own
name
to
it
on
that
afternoon
do
not
be
unhappy
i
am
doing
well
silverbridge
is
with
me
on
the
thursday
gerald
came
home
from
scotland
he
had
arranged
his
little
affair
with
lord
percival
not
however
without
some
difficulty
lord
percival
had
declared
he
did
not
understand
in
an
affair
of
that
kind
he
had
always
thought
that
gentlemen
did
not
play
for
stakes
which
they
could
not
pay
at
once
this
was
not
said
to
gerald
himself
or
the
result
would
have
been
calamitous
nidderdale
was
the
and
at
last
arranged
it
not
however
till
he
had
pointed
out
that
percival
having
won
so
large
a
sum
of
money
from
a
lad
under
years
of
age
was
very
lucky
in
receiving
substantial
security
for
its
payment
gerald
had
chosen
the
period
of
his
father
absence
for
his
return
it
was
necessary
that
the
story
of
the
gambling
debt
should
be
told
the
duke
in
february
silverbridge
had
explained
that
to
him
and
he
had
quite
understood
it
he
indeed
would
be
up
at
oxford
in
february
and
in
that
case
the
first
horror
of
the
thing
would
be
left
to
poor
silverbridge
thinking
of
this
gerald
felt
that
he
was
bound
to
tell
his
father
himself
he
resolved
that
he
would
do
so
but
was
anxious
to
postpone
the
evil
day
he
lingered
therefore
in
scotland
till
he
knew
that
his
father
was
in
barsetshire
on
his
arrival
he
was
told
of
tregear
accident
oh
gerald
have
you
heard
said
his
sister
he
had
not
as
yet
heard
and
then
the
history
was
repeated
to
him
mary
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
her
own
feelings
she
was
as
open
with
her
brother
as
she
had
been
with
finn
i
suppose
he
get
over
it
said
gerald
is
that
all
you
say
she
asked
what
can
i
say
better
i
suppose
he
will
fellows
always
do
get
over
that
kind
of
thing
herbert
de
burgh
smashed
both
his
thighs
and
now
he
can
move
about
again
of
course
with
crutches
gerald
how
can
you
be
so
unfeeling
i
do
know
what
you
mean
i
always
liked
tregear
and
i
am
very
sorry
for
him
if
you
would
take
it
a
little
quieter
i
think
it
would
be
better
i
could
not
take
it
quietly
how
can
i
take
it
quietly
when
he
is
more
than
all
the
world
to
me
you
should
keep
that
to
yourself
yes
and
so
let
people
think
that
i
did
care
till
i
broke
my
heart
i
shall
say
just
the
same
to
papa
when
he
comes
home
after
that
the
brother
and
sister
were
not
on
very
good
terms
with
each
other
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
on
the
saturday
there
was
a
letter
from
silverbridge
to
finn
tregear
was
better
but
was
unhappy
because
it
had
been
decided
that
he
could
not
be
moved
for
the
next
month
this
entailed
two
misfortunes
on
him
first
that
of
being
the
enforced
guest
of
persons
who
were
not
or
hitherto
had
not
been
his
own
friends
and
then
his
absence
from
the
first
meeting
of
parliament
when
a
gentleman
has
been
in
parliament
some
years
he
may
be
able
to
reconcile
himself
to
an
obligatory
vacation
with
a
calm
mind
but
when
the
honours
and
glory
are
new
and
the
tedium
of
the
benches
has
not
yet
been
experienced
then
such
an
accident
is
felt
to
be
a
grievance
but
the
young
member
was
out
of
danger
and
was
as
silverbridge
declared
in
the
very
best
quarters
which
could
be
provided
for
a
man
in
such
a
position
phineas
finn
told
him
all
the
politics
spooner
related
to
him
on
sundays
and
wednesdays
all
the
hunting
details
while
lady
chiltern
read
to
him
light
literature
because
he
was
not
allowed
to
hold
a
book
in
his
hand
i
wish
it
were
me
said
gerald
i
wish
i
were
there
to
read
to
him
said
mary
then
the
duke
came
home
mary
said
he
i
have
been
distressed
to
hear
of
this
accident
this
seemed
to
her
to
be
the
kindest
word
she
had
heard
from
him
for
a
long
time
i
believe
him
to
be
a
worthy
young
man
i
am
sorry
that
he
should
be
the
cause
of
so
much
sorrow
to
you
and
to
me
of
course
i
was
sorry
for
his
accident
she
replied
after
pausing
awhile
but
now
that
he
is
better
i
will
not
call
him
a
cause
of
sorrow
to
me
then
the
duke
said
nothing
further
about
tregear
nor
did
she
so
you
have
come
at
last
he
said
to
gerald
that
was
the
first
greeting
to
which
the
son
responded
by
an
awkward
smile
but
in
the
course
of
the
evening
he
walked
straight
up
to
his
father
i
have
something
to
tell
you
sir
said
he
something
to
tell
me
something
that
will
make
you
very
angry
chapter
lxv
do
you
ever
think
what
money
is
gerald
told
his
story
standing
bolt
upright
and
looking
his
father
full
in
the
face
as
he
told
it
you
lost
three
thousand
four
hundred
pounds
at
one
sitting
to
lord
percival
at
cards
yes
sir
in
lord
nidderdale
house
yes
sir
nidderdale
was
playing
it
was
his
fault
who
were
playing
percival
and
dolly
longstaff
and
jack
hindes
and
popplecourt
was
playing
at
first
lord
popplecourt
yes
sir
but
he
went
away
when
he
began
to
lose
three
thousand
four
hundred
pounds
how
old
are
you
i
am
just
you
are
beginning
the
world
well
gerald
what
is
the
engagement
which
silverbridge
has
made
with
lord
percival
to
pay
him
the
money
at
the
end
of
next
month
what
had
silverbridge
to
do
with
it
nothing
sir
i
wrote
to
silverbridge
because
i
did
know
what
to
do
i
knew
he
would
stand
to
me
who
is
to
stand
to
either
of
you
if
you
go
on
thus
i
do
not
know
to
this
gerald
of
course
made
no
reply
but
an
idea
came
across
his
mind
that
he
knew
who
would
stand
both
to
himself
and
his
brother
how
did
silverbridge
mean
to
get
the
money
he
said
he
would
ask
you
but
i
thought
that
i
ought
to
tell
you
is
that
all
all
what
sir
are
there
other
debts
to
this
gerald
made
no
reply
other
gambling
debts
no
sir
not
a
shilling
of
that
kind
i
have
never
played
before
does
it
ever
occur
to
you
that
going
on
at
that
rate
you
may
very
soon
lose
all
the
fortune
that
will
ever
come
to
you
you
were
not
yet
of
age
and
you
lost
three
thousand
four
hundred
pounds
at
cards
to
a
man
whom
you
probably
knew
to
be
a
professed
gambler
the
duke
seemed
to
wait
for
a
reply
but
poor
gerald
had
not
a
word
to
say
can
you
explain
to
me
what
benefit
you
proposed
to
yourself
when
you
played
for
such
stakes
as
that
i
hoped
to
win
back
what
i
had
lost
facilis
descensus
averni
said
the
duke
shaking
his
head
noctes
atque
dies
patet
atri
janua
ditis
no
doubt
he
thought
that
as
his
son
was
at
oxford
admonitions
in
latin
would
serve
him
better
than
in
his
native
tongue
but
gerald
when
he
heard
the
grand
hexameter
rolled
out
in
his
father
grandest
tone
entertained
a
comfortable
feeling
that
the
worst
of
the
interview
was
over
win
back
what
you
had
lost
do
you
think
that
that
is
the
common
fortune
of
young
gamblers
when
they
fall
among
those
who
are
more
experienced
than
themselves
one
goes
on
sir
without
reflecting
go
on
without
reflecting
yes
and
where
to
where
to
oh
gerald
where
to
whither
will
such
progress
without
reflection
take
you
he
means
to
the
devil
the
lad
said
inwardly
to
himself
without
moving
his
lips
there
is
but
one
goal
for
such
going
on
as
that
i
can
pay
three
thousand
four
hundred
pounds
for
you
certainly
i
think
it
hard
that
i
should
have
to
do
so
but
i
can
do
it
and
i
will
do
it
thank
you
sir
murmured
gerald
but
how
can
i
wash
your
young
mind
clean
from
the
foul
stain
which
has
already
defiled
it
why
did
you
sit
down
to
play
was
it
to
win
the
money
which
these
men
had
in
their
pockets
not
particularly
it
can
not
be
that
a
rational
being
should
consent
to
risk
the
money
he
has
himself
to
risk
even
the
money
which
he
has
not
himself
without
a
desire
to
win
that
which
as
yet
belongs
to
his
opponents
you
desired
to
win
i
suppose
i
did
hope
to
win
and
why
why
did
you
want
to
extract
their
property
from
their
pockets
and
to
put
it
into
your
own
that
the
footpad
on
the
road
should
have
such
desire
when
with
his
pistol
he
stops
the
traveller
on
his
journey
we
all
understand
and
we
know
what
we
think
of
the
footpad
and
what
we
do
to
him
he
is
a
poor
creature
who
from
his
youth
upwards
has
had
no
good
thing
done
for
him
uneducated
an
outcast
whom
we
should
pity
more
than
we
despise
him
we
take
him
as
a
pest
which
we
can
not
endure
and
lock
him
up
where
he
can
harm
us
no
more
on
my
word
gerald
i
think
that
the
gentleman
who
sits
down
with
the
deliberate
intention
of
extracting
money
from
the
pockets
of
his
antagonists
who
lays
out
for
himself
that
way
of
repairing
the
shortcomings
of
fortune
who
looks
to
that
resource
as
an
aid
to
his
means
is
worse
much
worse
than
the
public
robber
he
is
meaner
more
cowardly
and
has
i
think
in
his
bosom
less
of
the
feelings
of
an
honest
man
and
he
probably
has
been
educated
as
you
have
been
he
calls
himself
a
gentleman
he
should
know
black
from
white
it
is
considered
terrible
to
cheat
at
cards
there
was
nothing
of
that
sir
the
man
who
plays
and
cheats
has
fallen
low
indeed
i
understand
that
sir
he
who
plays
that
he
may
make
an
income
but
does
not
cheat
has
fallen
nearly
as
low
do
you
ever
think
what
money
is
the
duke
paused
so
long
collecting
his
own
thoughts
and
thinking
of
his
own
words
that
gerald
found
himself
obliged
to
answer
cheques
and
sovereigns
and
he
replied
with
much
hesitation
money
is
the
reward
of
labour
said
the
duke
or
rather
in
the
shape
it
reaches
you
it
is
your
representation
of
that
reward
you
may
earn
it
yourself
or
as
is
i
am
afraid
more
likely
to
be
the
case
with
you
you
may
possess
it
honestly
as
prepared
for
you
by
the
labour
of
others
who
have
stored
it
up
for
you
but
it
is
a
commodity
of
which
you
are
bound
to
see
that
the
source
is
not
only
clean
but
noble
you
would
not
let
lord
percival
give
you
money
he
would
do
that
sir
i
am
sure
nor
would
you
take
it
there
is
nothing
so
comfortable
as
money
but
nothing
so
defiling
if
it
be
come
by
unworthily
nothing
so
comfortable
but
nothing
so
noxious
if
the
mind
be
allowed
to
dwell
upon
it
constantly
if
a
man
have
enough
let
him
spend
it
freely
if
he
wants
it
let
him
earn
it
honestly
let
him
do
something
for
it
so
that
the
man
who
pays
it
to
him
may
get
its
value
but
to
think
that
it
may
be
got
by
gambling
to
hope
to
live
after
that
fashion
to
sit
down
with
your
fingers
almost
in
your
neighbour
pockets
with
your
eye
on
his
purse
trusting
that
you
may
know
better
than
he
some
studied
calculations
as
to
the
pips
concealed
in
your
hands
praying
to
the
only
god
you
worship
that
some
special
card
may
be
vouchsafed
to
you
that
i
say
is
to
have
left
far
far
behind
you
all
nobility
all
gentleness
all
manhood
write
me
down
lord
percival
address
and
i
will
send
him
the
money
then
the
duke
wrote
a
cheque
for
the
money
claimed
and
sent
it
with
a
note
as
follows
the
duke
of
omnium
presents
his
compliments
to
lord
percival
the
duke
has
been
informed
by
lord
gerald
palliser
that
lord
percival
has
won
at
cards
from
him
the
sum
of
three
thousand
four
hundred
pounds
the
duke
now
encloses
a
cheque
for
that
amount
and
requests
that
the
document
which
lord
percival
holds
from
lord
silverbridge
as
security
for
the
amount
may
be
returned
to
lord
gerald
let
the
noble
gambler
have
his
prey
he
was
little
solicitous
about
that
if
he
could
only
so
operate
on
the
mind
of
this
son
so
operate
on
the
minds
of
both
his
sons
as
to
make
them
see
the
foolishness
of
folly
the
ugliness
of
what
is
mean
the
squalor
and
dirt
of
ignoble
pursuits
then
he
could
easily
pardon
past
faults
if
it
were
half
his
wealth
what
would
it
signify
if
he
could
teach
his
children
to
accept
those
lessons
without
which
no
man
can
live
as
a
gentleman
let
his
rank
be
the
highest
known
let
his
wealth
be
as
the
sands
his
fashion
unrivalled
the
word
or
two
which
his
daughter
had
said
to
him
declaring
that
she
still
took
pride
in
her
lover
love
and
then
this
new
misfortune
on
gerald
part
upset
him
greatly
he
almost
sickened
of
politics
when
he
thought
of
his
domestic
bereavement
and
his
domestic
misfortunes
how
completely
had
he
failed
to
indoctrinate
his
children
with
the
ideas
by
which
his
own
mind
was
fortified
and
controlled
nothing
was
so
base
to
him
as
a
gambler
and
they
had
both
commenced
their
career
by
gambling
from
their
young
boyhood
nothing
had
seemed
so
desirable
to
him
as
that
they
should
be
accustomed
by
early
training
to
devote
themselves
to
the
service
of
their
country
he
saw
other
young
noblemen
around
him
who
at
eighteen
were
known
as
debaters
at
their
colleges
or
at
were
already
deep
in
politics
social
science
and
educational
projects
what
good
would
all
his
wealth
or
all
his
position
do
for
his
children
if
their
minds
could
rise
to
nothing
beyond
the
shooting
of
deer
and
the
hunting
of
foxes
there
was
young
lord
buttercup
the
son
of
the
earl
of
woolantallow
only
a
few
months
older
than
silverbridge
who
was
already
a
junior
lord
and
as
constant
at
his
office
or
during
the
session
on
the
treasury
bench
as
though
there
were
not
a
pack
of
hounds
or
a
in
great
britain
lord
buttercup
too
had
already
written
an
article
in
the
fortnightly
on
the
subject
of
turkish
finance
how
long
would
it
be
before
silverbridge
would
write
an
article
or
gerald
sign
his
name
in
the
service
of
the
public
and
then
those
proposed
marriages
as
to
which
he
was
beginning
to
know
that
his
children
would
be
too
strong
for
him
anxious
as
he
was
that
both
his
sons
should
be
permeated
by
liberal
politics
studious
as
he
had
ever
been
to
teach
them
that
the
highest
duty
of
those
high
in
rank
was
to
use
their
authority
to
elevate
those
beneath
them
still
he
was
hardly
less
anxious
to
make
them
understand
that
their
second
duty
required
them
to
maintain
their
own
position
it
was
by
feeling
this
second
duty
by
feeling
it
and
performing
it
that
they
would
be
enabled
to
perform
the
rest
and
now
both
silverbridge
and
his
girl
were
bent
upon
marriages
by
which
they
would
depart
out
of
their
own
order
let
silverbridge
marry
whom
he
might
he
could
not
be
other
than
heir
to
the
honours
of
his
family
but
by
his
marriage
he
might
either
support
or
derogate
from
these
honours
and
now
having
at
first
made
a
choice
that
was
good
he
had
altered
his
mind
from
simple
freak
captivated
by
a
pair
of
bright
eyes
and
an
arch
smile
and
without
a
feeling
in
regard
to
his
family
was
anxious
to
take
to
his
bosom
the
granddaughter
of
an
american
and
then
his
girl
of
whose
beauty
he
was
so
proud
from
whose
manners
and
tastes
and
modes
of
life
he
had
expected
to
reap
those
good
things
in
a
feminine
degree
which
his
sons
as
young
men
seemed
so
little
fitted
to
give
him
by
slow
degrees
he
had
been
brought
round
to
acknowledge
that
the
young
man
was
worthy
tregear
conduct
had
been
felt
by
the
duke
to
be
manly
the
letter
he
had
written
was
a
good
letter
and
then
he
had
won
for
himself
a
seat
in
the
house
of
commons
when
forced
to
speak
of
him
to
this
girl
he
had
been
driven
by
justice
to
call
him
worthy
but
how
could
he
serve
to
support
and
strengthen
that
nobility
the
endurance
and
perpetuation
of
which
should
be
the
peculiar
care
of
every
palliser
and
yet
as
the
duke
walked
about
his
room
he
felt
that
his
opposition
either
to
the
one
marriage
or
to
the
other
was
vain
of
course
they
would
marry
according
to
their
wills
that
same
night
gerald
wrote
to
his
brother
before
he
went
to
bed
as
follows
dear
silver
i
was
awfully
obliged
to
you
for
sending
me
the
for
that
brute
percival
he
only
sneered
when
he
took
it
and
would
have
said
something
disagreeable
but
that
he
saw
that
i
was
in
earnest
i
know
he
did
say
something
to
nid
only
i
ca
find
out
what
nid
is
an
fellow
and
as
i
saw
did
want
to
have
a
rumpus
but
now
what
do
you
think
i
done
directly
i
got
home
i
told
the
governor
all
about
it
as
i
was
in
the
train
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
i
went
slap
at
it
if
there
is
anything
that
never
does
any
good
it
craning
i
did
it
all
at
one
rush
just
as
though
i
was
swallowing
a
dose
of
physic
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
all
that
the
governor
said
because
it
was
really
what
is
a
fellow
to
get
by
playing
high
a
fellow
like
you
and
me
i
want
any
of
that
beast
money
i
do
suppose
he
had
any
but
one
dander
gets
up
and
one
does
like
to
be
done
and
so
it
goes
on
i
shall
cut
that
kind
of
thing
altogether
you
should
have
heard
the
governor
spouting
latin
and
then
the
way
he
sat
upon
percival
without
mentioning
the
fellow
name
i
do
think
it
mean
to
set
yourself
to
work
to
win
money
at
cards
and
it
is
awfully
mean
to
lose
more
than
you
have
got
to
pay
then
at
the
end
the
governor
said
he
send
the
beast
a
cheque
for
the
amount
you
know
his
way
of
finishing
up
just
like
two
fellows
fighting
when
one
has
awfully
punished
the
other
he
goes
up
and
shakes
hands
with
him
he
did
pitch
into
me
not
abusing
me
nor
even
saying
a
word
about
the
money
which
he
at
once
promised
to
pay
but
laying
it
on
to
gambling
with
a
regular
and
then
there
was
an
end
of
it
he
just
asked
the
fellow
address
and
said
that
he
would
send
him
the
money
i
will
say
this
i
do
think
there
a
greater
brick
than
the
governor
out
anywhere
i
am
awfully
sorry
about
tregear
i
ca
quite
make
out
how
it
happened
i
suppose
you
were
too
near
him
and
melrose
always
does
rush
at
his
fences
one
fellow
should
be
too
near
another
fellow
only
it
so
often
happens
that
it
ca
be
helped
it
just
like
anything
else
if
nothing
comes
of
it
then
it
all
right
but
if
anybody
comes
to
grief
then
he
has
got
to
be
pitched
into
do
you
remember
when
i
nearly
cut
over
old
sir
simon
slobody
did
i
hear
about
it
i
am
awfully
glad
you
did
smash
up
tregear
altogether
because
of
mary
i
am
quite
sure
it
is
no
good
anybody
setting
up
his
back
against
that
it
one
of
the
things
that
have
got
to
be
you
always
have
said
that
he
is
a
good
fellow
if
so
what
the
harm
at
any
rate
it
has
got
to
be
your
affectionate
brother
gerald
i
go
up
in
about
a
week
chapter
lxvi
the
three
attacks
during
the
following
week
the
communications
between
harrington
and
matching
were
very
frequent
there
were
no
further
direct
messages
between
tregear
and
lady
mary
but
she
heard
daily
of
his
progress
the
duke
was
conscious
of
the
special
interest
which
existed
in
his
house
as
to
the
condition
of
the
young
man
but
after
his
arrival
not
a
word
was
spoken
for
some
days
between
him
and
his
daughter
on
the
subject
then
gerald
went
back
to
his
college
and
the
duke
made
his
preparations
for
going
up
to
town
and
making
some
attempt
at
parliamentary
activity
it
was
by
no
concert
that
an
attack
was
made
upon
him
from
three
quarters
at
once
as
he
was
preparing
to
leave
matching
on
the
sunday
morning
during
church
time
for
on
that
day
lady
mary
went
to
her
devotions
alone
finn
was
closeted
for
an
hour
with
the
duke
in
his
study
i
think
you
ought
to
be
aware
she
said
to
the
duke
that
though
i
trust
mary
implicitly
and
know
her
to
be
thoroughly
high
principled
i
can
not
be
responsible
for
her
if
i
remain
with
her
here
i
do
not
quite
follow
your
meaning
of
course
there
is
but
one
matter
on
which
there
can
probably
be
any
difference
between
us
if
she
should
choose
to
write
to
tregear
or
to
send
him
a
message
or
even
to
go
to
him
i
could
not
prevent
it
go
to
him
exclaimed
the
horrified
duke
i
merely
suggest
such
a
thing
in
order
to
make
you
understand
that
i
have
absolutely
no
control
over
her
what
control
have
i
nay
i
can
not
define
that
you
are
her
father
and
she
acknowledges
your
authority
she
regards
me
as
a
friend
and
as
such
treats
me
with
the
sweetest
affection
nothing
can
be
more
gratifying
than
her
manner
to
me
personally
it
ought
to
be
so
she
has
thoroughly
won
my
heart
but
still
i
know
that
if
there
were
a
difference
between
us
she
would
not
obey
me
why
should
she
because
you
hold
my
deputed
authority
oh
duke
that
goes
for
very
little
anywhere
no
one
can
depute
authority
it
comes
too
much
from
personal
accidents
and
too
little
from
reason
or
law
to
be
handed
over
to
others
besides
i
fear
that
on
one
matter
concerning
her
you
and
i
are
not
agreed
i
shall
be
sorry
if
it
be
so
i
feel
that
i
am
bound
to
tell
you
my
opinion
oh
yes
you
think
that
in
the
end
lady
mary
will
allow
herself
to
be
separated
from
tregear
i
think
that
in
the
end
they
will
become
man
and
wife
this
seemed
to
the
duke
to
be
not
quite
so
bad
as
it
might
have
been
any
speculation
as
to
results
were
very
different
from
an
expressed
opinion
as
to
propriety
were
he
to
tell
the
truth
as
to
his
own
mind
he
might
perhaps
have
said
the
same
thing
but
one
is
not
to
relax
in
one
endeavours
to
prevent
that
which
is
wrong
because
one
fears
that
the
wrong
may
be
ultimately
perpetrated
let
that
be
as
it
may
he
said
it
can
not
alter
my
duty
nor
mine
duke
if
i
may
presume
to
think
that
i
have
a
duty
in
this
matter
that
you
should
encounter
the
burden
of
the
duty
binds
me
to
you
for
ever
if
it
be
that
they
will
certainly
be
married
one
day
who
has
said
that
who
has
admitted
that
if
it
be
so
if
it
seems
to
me
that
it
must
be
so
then
how
can
i
be
anxious
to
prolong
her
sufferings
she
does
suffer
terribly
upon
this
the
duke
frowned
but
there
was
more
of
tenderness
in
his
frown
than
in
the
hard
smile
which
he
had
hitherto
worn
i
do
not
know
whether
you
see
it
all
he
well
remembered
all
that
he
had
seen
when
he
and
mary
were
travelling
together
i
see
it
and
i
do
not
pass
half
an
hour
with
her
without
sorrowing
for
her
on
hearing
this
he
sighed
and
turned
his
face
away
girls
are
so
different
there
are
many
who
though
they
be
genuinely
in
love
though
their
natures
are
sweet
and
affectionate
are
not
strong
enough
to
support
their
own
feelings
in
resistance
to
the
will
of
those
who
have
authority
over
them
had
it
been
so
with
his
wife
at
this
moment
all
the
former
history
passed
through
his
mind
they
yield
to
that
which
seems
to
be
inevitable
and
allow
themselves
to
be
fashioned
by
the
purposes
of
others
it
is
well
for
them
often
that
they
are
so
plastic
whether
it
would
be
better
for
her
that
she
should
be
so
i
will
not
say
it
would
be
better
said
the
duke
doggedly
but
such
is
not
her
nature
she
is
as
determined
as
ever
i
may
be
determined
too
but
if
at
last
it
will
be
of
no
use
if
it
be
her
fate
either
to
be
married
to
this
man
or
die
of
a
broken
heart
what
justifies
you
in
saying
that
how
can
you
torture
me
by
such
a
threat
if
i
think
so
duke
i
am
justified
of
late
i
have
been
with
her
daily
almost
hourly
i
do
not
say
that
this
will
kill
her
now
in
her
youth
it
is
not
often
i
fancy
that
women
die
after
that
fashion
but
a
broken
heart
may
bring
the
sufferer
to
the
grave
after
a
lapse
of
many
years
how
will
it
be
with
you
if
she
should
live
like
a
ghost
beside
you
for
the
next
twenty
years
and
you
should
then
see
her
die
faded
and
withered
before
her
time
all
her
life
gone
without
a
joy
because
she
had
loved
a
man
whose
position
in
life
was
displeasing
to
you
would
the
ground
on
which
the
sacrifice
had
been
made
then
justify
itself
to
you
in
thus
performing
your
duty
to
your
order
would
you
feel
satisfied
that
you
had
performed
that
to
your
child
she
had
come
there
determined
to
say
it
all
to
liberate
her
own
soul
as
it
were
but
had
much
doubted
the
spirit
in
which
the
duke
would
listen
to
her
that
he
would
listen
to
her
she
was
sure
and
then
if
he
chose
to
cast
her
out
she
would
endure
his
wrath
it
would
not
be
to
her
now
as
it
had
been
when
he
accused
her
of
treachery
but
nevertheless
bold
as
she
was
and
independent
he
had
imbued
her
as
he
did
all
those
around
him
with
so
strong
a
sense
of
his
personal
dignity
that
when
she
had
finished
she
almost
trembled
as
she
looked
in
his
face
since
he
had
asked
her
how
she
could
justify
to
herself
the
threats
which
she
was
using
he
had
sat
still
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
her
now
when
she
had
done
he
was
in
no
hurry
to
speak
he
rose
slowly
and
walking
towards
the
fireplace
stood
with
his
back
towards
her
looking
down
upon
the
fire
she
was
the
first
to
speak
again
shall
i
leave
you
now
she
said
in
a
low
voice
perhaps
it
will
be
better
he
answered
his
voice
too
was
very
low
in
truth
he
was
so
moved
that
he
hardly
knew
how
to
speak
at
all
then
she
rose
and
was
already
on
her
way
to
the
door
when
he
followed
her
one
moment
if
you
please
he
said
almost
sternly
i
am
under
a
debt
of
gratitude
to
you
of
which
i
can
not
express
my
sense
in
words
how
far
i
may
agree
with
you
and
where
i
may
disagree
i
will
not
attempt
to
point
out
to
you
now
oh
no
but
all
that
you
have
troubled
yourself
to
think
and
to
feel
in
this
matter
and
all
that
true
friendship
has
compelled
you
to
say
to
me
shall
be
written
down
in
the
tablets
of
my
memory
duke
my
child
has
at
any
rate
been
fortunate
in
securing
the
friendship
of
such
a
friend
then
he
turned
back
to
the
fireplace
and
she
was
constrained
to
leave
the
room
without
another
word
she
had
determined
to
make
the
best
plea
in
her
power
for
mary
and
while
she
was
making
the
plea
had
been
almost
surprised
by
her
own
vehemence
but
the
greater
had
been
her
vehemence
the
stronger
she
thought
would
have
been
the
duke
anger
and
as
she
had
watched
the
workings
of
his
face
she
had
felt
for
a
moment
that
the
vials
of
his
wrath
were
about
to
be
poured
out
upon
her
even
when
she
left
the
room
she
almost
believed
that
had
he
not
taken
those
moments
for
consideration
at
the
fireplace
his
parting
words
would
have
been
different
but
as
it
was
there
could
be
no
question
now
of
her
departure
no
power
was
left
to
her
of
separating
herself
from
lady
mary
though
the
duke
had
not
as
yet
acknowledged
himself
to
be
conquered
there
was
no
doubt
to
her
now
but
that
he
would
be
conquered
and
she
either
here
or
in
london
must
be
the
nearest
friend
up
to
the
day
when
she
should
be
given
over
to
tregear
that
was
one
of
the
three
attacks
which
were
made
upon
the
duke
before
he
went
up
to
his
parliamentary
duties
the
second
was
as
follows
among
the
letters
on
the
following
morning
one
was
brought
to
him
from
tregear
it
is
hoped
that
the
reader
will
remember
the
lover
former
letter
and
the
very
unsatisfactory
answer
which
had
been
sent
to
it
nothing
could
have
been
colder
less
propitious
or
more
inveterately
hostile
than
the
reply
as
he
lay
in
bed
with
his
broken
bones
at
harrington
he
had
ample
time
for
thinking
over
all
this
he
knew
every
word
of
the
duke
distressing
note
by
heart
and
had
often
lashed
himself
to
rage
as
he
had
repeated
it
but
he
could
effect
nothing
by
showing
his
anger
he
must
go
on
and
still
do
something
since
the
writing
of
that
letter
he
had
done
something
he
had
got
his
seat
in
parliament
and
he
had
secured
the
interest
of
his
friend
silverbridge
this
had
been
partially
done
at
polwenning
but
the
accident
in
the
brake
country
had
completed
the
work
the
brother
had
at
last
declared
himself
in
his
friend
favour
of
course
i
should
be
glad
to
see
it
he
had
said
while
sitting
by
tregear
bedside
the
worst
is
that
everything
does
seem
to
go
against
the
poor
governor
then
tregear
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
write
another
letter
personally
he
was
not
in
the
best
condition
for
doing
this
as
he
was
lying
in
bed
with
his
left
arm
tied
up
and
with
straps
and
bandages
all
round
his
body
but
he
could
sit
up
in
bed
and
his
right
hand
and
arm
were
free
so
he
declared
to
lady
chiltern
his
purpose
of
writing
a
letter
she
tried
to
dissuade
him
gently
and
offered
to
be
his
secretary
but
when
he
assured
her
that
no
secretary
could
write
this
letter
for
him
she
understood
pretty
well
what
would
be
the
subject
of
the
letter
with
considerable
difficulty
tregear
wrote
his
letter
my
lord
duke
on
this
occasion
he
left
out
the
epithet
which
he
had
before
used
your
grace
reply
to
my
last
letter
was
not
encouraging
but
in
spite
of
your
prohibition
i
venture
to
write
to
you
again
if
i
had
the
slightest
reason
for
thinking
that
your
daughter
was
estranged
from
me
i
would
not
persecute
either
you
or
her
but
if
it
be
true
that
she
is
as
devoted
to
me
as
i
am
to
her
can
i
be
wrong
in
pleading
my
cause
is
it
not
evident
to
you
that
she
is
made
of
such
stuff
that
she
will
not
be
controlled
in
her
choice
even
by
your
will
i
have
had
an
accident
in
the
and
am
now
writing
from
lord
chiltern
house
where
i
am
confined
to
bed
but
i
think
you
will
understand
me
when
i
say
that
even
in
this
helpless
condition
i
feel
myself
constrained
to
do
something
of
course
i
ask
for
nothing
from
you
on
my
own
behalf
but
on
her
behalf
may
i
not
add
my
prayers
to
hers
i
have
the
honour
to
be
your
grace
very
faithful
servant
francis
tregear
this
coming
alone
would
perhaps
have
had
no
effect
the
duke
had
desired
the
young
man
not
to
address
him
again
and
the
young
man
had
disobeyed
him
no
mere
courtesy
would
now
have
constrained
him
to
send
any
reply
to
this
further
letter
but
coming
as
it
did
while
his
heart
was
still
throbbing
with
the
effects
of
finn
words
it
was
allowed
to
have
a
certain
force
the
argument
used
was
a
true
argument
his
girl
was
devoted
to
the
man
who
sought
her
hand
finn
had
told
him
that
sooner
or
later
he
must
yield
unless
he
was
prepared
to
see
his
child
wither
and
fade
at
his
side
he
had
once
thought
that
he
would
be
prepared
even
for
that
he
had
endeavoured
to
strengthen
his
own
will
by
arguing
with
himself
that
when
he
saw
a
duty
plainly
before
him
he
should
cleave
to
that
let
the
results
be
what
they
might
but
that
picture
of
her
face
withered
and
wan
after
twenty
years
of
sorrowing
had
had
its
effect
upon
his
heart
he
even
made
excuses
within
his
own
breast
in
the
young
man
favour
he
was
in
parliament
now
and
what
may
not
be
done
for
a
young
man
in
parliament
altogether
the
young
man
appeared
to
him
in
a
light
different
from
that
through
which
he
had
viewed
the
presumptuous
arrogant
utterly
unjustifiable
suitor
who
had
come
to
him
now
nearly
a
year
since
in
carlton
terrace
he
went
to
breakfast
with
tregear
letter
in
his
pocket
and
was
then
gracious
to
finn
and
tender
to
his
daughter
when
do
you
go
papa
mary
asked
i
shall
take
the
train
i
have
ordered
the
carriage
at
a
quarter
before
eleven
may
i
go
to
the
train
with
you
papa
certainly
i
shall
be
delighted
papa
mary
said
as
soon
as
she
found
herself
seated
beside
her
father
in
the
carriage
my
dear
oh
papa
and
she
threw
herself
on
to
his
breast
he
put
his
arm
round
her
and
kissed
her
as
he
would
have
had
so
much
delight
in
doing
as
he
would
have
done
so
often
before
had
there
not
been
this
ground
of
discord
she
was
very
sweet
to
him
it
had
never
seemed
to
him
that
she
had
disgraced
herself
by
loving
tregear
but
that
a
great
misfortune
had
fallen
upon
her
silverbridge
when
he
had
gone
into
a
racing
partnership
with
tifto
and
gerald
when
he
had
played
for
money
which
he
did
not
possess
had
degraded
themselves
in
his
estimation
he
would
not
have
used
such
a
word
but
it
was
his
feeling
they
were
less
noble
less
pure
than
they
might
have
been
had
they
kept
themselves
free
from
such
stain
but
this
girl
whether
she
should
live
and
fade
by
his
side
or
whether
she
should
give
her
hand
to
some
fitting
noble
suitor
or
even
though
she
might
at
last
become
the
wife
of
this
man
who
loved
her
would
always
have
been
pure
it
was
sweet
to
him
to
have
something
to
caress
now
in
the
solitude
of
his
life
as
years
were
coming
on
him
he
felt
how
necessary
it
was
that
he
should
have
someone
who
would
love
him
since
his
wife
had
left
him
he
had
been
debarred
from
these
caresses
by
the
necessity
of
showing
his
antagonism
to
her
dearest
wishes
it
had
been
his
duty
to
be
stern
in
all
his
words
to
his
daughter
he
had
been
governed
by
a
conviction
that
he
never
ought
to
allow
the
duty
of
separating
her
from
her
lover
to
be
absent
from
his
mind
he
was
not
prepared
to
acknowledge
that
that
duty
had
ceased
but
yet
there
had
crept
over
him
a
feeling
that
as
he
was
half
conquered
why
should
he
not
seek
some
recompense
in
his
daughter
love
papa
she
said
you
do
not
hate
me
hate
you
my
darling
because
i
am
disobedient
oh
papa
i
can
not
help
it
he
should
not
have
come
he
should
not
have
been
let
to
come
he
had
not
a
word
to
say
to
her
he
could
not
as
yet
bring
himself
to
tell
her
that
it
should
be
as
she
desired
much
less
could
he
now
argue
with
her
as
to
the
impossibility
of
such
a
marriage
as
he
had
done
on
former
occasions
when
the
matter
had
been
discussed
he
could
only
press
his
arm
tightly
round
her
waist
and
be
silent
it
can
not
be
altered
now
papa
look
at
me
tell
me
that
you
love
me
have
you
doubted
my
love
no
papa
but
i
would
do
anything
to
make
you
happy
anything
that
i
could
do
papa
you
do
not
want
me
to
marry
lord
popplecourt
i
would
not
have
you
marry
any
man
without
loving
him
i
never
can
love
anybody
else
that
is
what
i
wanted
you
to
know
papa
to
this
he
made
no
reply
nor
was
there
anything
else
said
upon
the
subject
before
the
carriage
drove
up
to
the
railway
station
do
not
get
out
dear
he
said
seeing
that
her
eyes
had
been
filled
with
tears
it
is
not
worth
while
god
bless
you
my
child
you
will
be
up
in
london
i
hope
in
a
fortnight
and
we
must
try
to
make
the
house
a
little
less
dull
for
you
and
so
he
had
encountered
the
third
attack
lady
mary
as
she
was
driven
home
recovered
her
spirits
wonderfully
not
a
word
had
fallen
from
her
father
which
she
could
use
hereafter
as
a
refuge
from
her
embarrassments
he
had
made
her
no
promise
he
had
assented
to
nothing
but
there
had
been
something
in
his
manner
in
his
gait
in
his
eye
in
the
pressure
of
his
arm
which
made
her
feel
that
her
troubles
would
soon
be
at
an
end
i
do
love
you
so
much
she
said
to
finn
late
on
that
afternoon
i
am
glad
of
that
dear
i
shall
always
love
you
because
you
have
been
on
my
side
all
through
no
mary
that
is
not
so
i
know
it
is
so
of
course
you
have
to
be
wise
because
you
are
older
and
papa
would
not
have
you
here
with
me
if
you
were
not
wise
but
i
know
you
are
on
my
side
and
papa
knows
it
too
and
someone
else
shall
know
it
some
day
chapter
lxvii
he
is
such
a
beast
lord
silverbridge
remained
hunting
in
the
brake
country
till
a
few
days
before
the
meeting
of
parliament
and
had
he
been
left
to
himself
he
would
have
had
another
week
in
the
country
and
might
probably
have
overstayed
the
opening
day
but
he
had
not
been
left
to
himself
in
the
last
week
in
january
an
important
despatch
reached
his
hands
from
no
less
important
a
person
than
sir
timothy
beeswax
suggesting
to
him
that
he
should
undertake
the
duty
of
seconding
the
address
in
the
house
of
commons
when
the
proposition
first
reached
him
it
made
his
hair
stand
on
end
he
had
never
yet
risen
to
his
feet
in
the
house
he
had
spoken
at
those
election
meetings
in
cornwall
and
had
found
it
easy
enough
after
the
first
or
second
time
he
had
thought
it
good
fun
but
he
knew
that
standing
up
in
the
house
of
commons
would
be
different
from
that
then
there
would
be
the
dress
i
should
so
hate
to
fig
myself
out
and
look
like
a
guy
he
said
to
tregear
to
whom
of
course
he
confided
the
offer
that
was
made
to
him
tregear
was
very
anxious
that
he
should
accept
it
a
man
should
never
refuse
anything
of
that
kind
which
comes
in
his
way
tregear
said
it
is
only
because
i
am
the
governor
son
silverbridge
pleaded
partly
so
perhaps
but
if
it
be
altogether
so
what
of
that
take
the
goods
the
gods
provide
you
of
course
all
these
things
which
our
ambition
covets
are
easier
to
duke
sons
than
to
others
but
not
on
that
account
should
a
duke
son
refuse
them
a
man
when
he
sees
a
rung
vacant
on
the
ladder
should
always
put
his
feet
there
i
tell
you
what
said
silverbridge
if
i
thought
this
was
all
fair
sailing
i
do
it
i
should
feel
certain
that
i
should
come
a
cropper
but
still
i
try
it
as
you
say
a
fellow
should
try
but
it
all
meant
as
a
blow
at
the
governor
old
beeswax
thinks
that
if
he
can
get
me
up
to
swear
that
he
and
his
crew
are
real
hands
that
will
hit
the
governor
hard
it
as
much
as
saying
to
the
governor
chap
belongs
to
me
not
to
you
that
a
thing
i
wo
go
in
for
then
tregear
counselled
him
to
write
to
his
father
for
advice
and
at
the
same
time
to
ask
sir
timothy
to
allow
him
a
day
or
two
for
consideration
this
counsel
he
took
his
letter
reached
his
father
two
days
before
he
left
matching
in
answer
to
it
there
came
first
a
telegram
begging
silverbridge
to
be
in
london
on
the
monday
and
then
a
letter
in
which
the
duke
expressed
himself
as
being
anxious
to
see
his
son
before
giving
a
final
answer
to
the
question
thus
it
was
that
silverbridge
had
been
taken
away
from
his
hunting
isabel
boncassen
however
was
now
in
london
and
from
her
it
was
possible
that
he
might
find
consolation
he
had
written
to
her
soon
after
reaching
harrington
telling
her
that
he
had
had
it
all
out
with
the
governor
there
is
a
good
deal
that
i
can
only
tell
you
when
i
see
you
he
said
then
he
assured
her
with
many
protestations
that
he
was
and
always
would
be
till
death
altogether
her
own
most
loving
to
this
he
had
received
an
answer
by
return
of
post
she
would
be
delighted
to
see
him
up
in
town
as
would
her
father
and
mother
they
had
now
got
a
comfortable
house
in
brook
street
and
then
she
signed
herself
his
sincere
friend
isabel
silverbridge
thought
that
it
was
cold
and
remembered
certain
scraps
in
another
feminine
handwriting
in
which
more
passion
was
expressed
perhaps
this
was
the
way
with
american
young
ladies
when
they
were
in
love
yes
said
the
duke
i
am
glad
that
you
have
come
up
at
once
as
sir
timothy
should
have
his
answer
without
further
delay
but
what
shall
i
say
the
duke
though
he
had
already
considered
the
matter
very
seriously
nevertheless
took
a
few
minutes
to
consider
it
again
the
offer
said
he
must
be
acknowledged
as
very
flattering
but
the
circumstances
are
not
usual
it
can
not
often
be
the
case
that
a
minister
should
ask
the
son
of
his
keenest
political
opponent
to
render
him
such
a
service
but
however
we
will
put
that
aside
not
quite
sir
for
the
present
we
will
put
that
on
one
side
not
looking
at
the
party
which
you
may
be
called
upon
to
support
having
for
the
moment
no
regard
to
this
or
that
line
in
politics
there
is
no
opening
to
the
real
duties
of
parliamentary
life
which
i
would
sooner
see
accorded
to
you
than
this
but
if
i
were
to
break
down
talking
to
his
father
he
could
not
quite
venture
to
ask
what
might
happen
if
he
were
to
come
a
cropper
none
but
the
brave
deserve
the
fair
said
the
duke
slapping
his
hands
upon
the
table
why
if
we
fail
fail
but
screw
your
courage
to
the
sticking
place
and
we
not
fail
what
high
point
would
ever
be
reached
if
caution
such
as
that
were
allowed
to
prevail
what
young
men
have
done
before
can
not
you
do
i
have
no
doubt
of
your
capacity
none
have
you
sir
said
silverbridge
considerably
gratified
and
also
surprised
none
in
the
least
but
perhaps
some
of
your
diligence
i
could
learn
it
by
heart
sir
if
you
mean
that
but
i
do
mean
that
or
rather
i
mean
much
more
than
that
you
have
first
to
realise
in
your
mind
the
thing
to
be
said
and
then
the
words
in
which
you
should
say
it
before
you
come
to
learning
by
heart
some
of
them
i
suppose
would
tell
me
what
to
say
no
doubt
with
your
inexperience
it
would
be
unfit
that
you
should
be
left
entirely
to
yourself
but
i
would
wish
you
to
know
perhaps
i
should
say
to
feel
that
the
sentiments
to
be
expressed
by
you
were
just
i
should
have
to
praise
sir
timothy
not
that
necessarily
but
you
would
have
to
advocate
that
course
in
parliament
which
sir
timothy
and
his
friends
have
taken
and
propose
to
take
but
i
hate
him
like
poison
there
need
be
no
personal
feeling
in
the
matter
i
remember
that
when
i
moved
the
address
in
your
house
mildmay
was
prime
minister
a
man
for
whom
my
regard
and
esteem
were
unbounded
who
had
been
in
political
matters
the
preceptor
of
my
youth
whom
as
a
patriotic
statesman
i
almost
worshipped
whom
i
now
remember
as
a
man
whose
departure
from
the
arena
of
politics
left
the
country
very
destitute
no
one
has
sprung
up
since
like
to
him
or
hardly
second
to
him
but
in
speaking
on
so
large
a
subject
as
the
policy
of
a
party
i
thought
it
beneath
me
to
eulogise
a
man
the
same
policy
reversed
may
keep
you
silent
respecting
sir
timothy
i
need
of
course
say
what
i
think
about
him
i
suppose
you
do
agree
with
sir
timothy
as
to
his
general
policy
on
no
other
condition
can
you
undertake
such
a
duty
of
course
i
have
voted
with
him
so
i
have
observed
not
so
regularly
perhaps
as
roby
would
have
desired
roby
was
the
conservative
whip
and
i
suppose
the
people
at
silverbridge
expect
me
to
support
him
i
hardly
know
how
that
may
be
they
used
to
be
contented
with
my
poor
services
no
doubt
they
feel
they
have
changed
for
the
better
you
should
say
that
sir
i
am
bound
to
suppose
that
they
think
so
because
when
the
matter
was
left
in
their
own
hands
they
at
once
elected
a
conservative
you
need
not
fear
that
you
will
offend
them
by
seconding
the
address
they
will
probably
feel
proud
to
see
their
young
member
brought
forward
on
such
an
occasion
as
i
shall
be
proud
to
see
my
son
you
would
if
it
were
on
the
other
side
sir
yes
silverbridge
yes
i
should
be
very
proud
if
it
were
on
the
other
side
but
there
is
a
useful
old
adage
which
bids
us
not
cry
for
spilt
milk
you
have
a
right
to
your
opinions
though
perhaps
i
may
think
that
in
adopting
what
i
must
call
new
opinions
you
were
a
little
precipitate
we
can
not
act
together
in
politics
but
not
the
less
on
that
account
do
i
wish
to
see
you
take
an
active
and
useful
part
on
that
side
to
which
you
have
attached
yourself
as
he
said
this
he
rose
from
his
seat
and
spoke
with
emphasis
as
though
he
were
addressing
some
imaginary
speaker
or
a
house
of
legislators
around
i
shall
be
proud
to
hear
you
second
the
address
if
you
do
it
as
gracefully
and
as
fitly
as
i
am
sure
you
may
if
you
will
give
yourself
the
trouble
i
shall
hear
you
do
it
with
infinite
satisfaction
even
though
i
shall
feel
at
the
same
time
anxious
to
answer
all
your
arguments
and
to
disprove
all
your
assertions
i
should
be
listening
no
doubt
to
my
opponent
but
i
should
be
proud
to
feel
that
i
was
listening
to
my
son
my
advice
to
you
is
to
do
as
sir
timothy
has
asked
you
he
is
such
a
beast
sir
said
silverbridge
pray
do
not
speak
in
that
way
on
matters
so
serious
i
do
not
think
you
quite
understand
it
sir
perhaps
not
can
you
enlighten
me
i
believe
he
has
done
this
only
to
annoy
you
the
duke
who
had
again
seated
himself
and
was
leaning
back
in
his
chair
raised
himself
up
placed
his
hands
on
the
table
before
him
and
looked
his
son
hard
in
the
face
the
idea
which
silverbridge
had
just
expressed
had
certainly
occurred
to
himself
he
remembered
well
all
the
circumstances
of
the
time
when
he
and
sir
timothy
beeswax
had
been
members
of
the
same
government
and
he
remembered
how
animosities
had
grown
and
how
treacherous
he
had
thought
the
man
from
the
moment
in
which
he
had
read
the
minister
letter
to
the
young
member
he
had
felt
that
the
offer
had
too
probably
come
from
a
desire
to
make
the
political
separation
between
himself
and
his
son
complete
but
he
had
thought
that
in
counselling
his
son
he
was
bound
to
ignore
such
a
feeling
and
it
certainly
had
not
occurred
to
him
that
silverbridge
would
be
astute
enough
to
perceive
the
same
thing
what
makes
you
fancy
that
said
the
duke
striving
to
conceal
by
his
manner
but
not
altogether
successful
in
concealing
the
gratification
which
he
certainly
felt
well
sir
i
am
not
sure
that
i
can
explain
it
of
course
it
is
putting
you
in
a
different
boat
from
me
you
have
already
chosen
your
boat
perhaps
he
thinks
i
may
get
out
again
i
dislike
the
skipper
so
much
that
i
am
not
sure
that
i
shall
not
oh
silverbridge
that
is
such
a
fault
so
much
is
included
in
that
which
is
unstatesmanlike
unpatriotic
almost
dishonest
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
would
be
this
or
that
in
politics
according
to
your
personal
liking
for
an
individual
when
you
do
trust
the
leader
you
ca
believe
very
firmly
in
the
followers
said
silverbridge
doggedly
i
wo
say
sir
what
i
may
do
though
i
dare
say
that
what
i
think
is
not
of
much
account
i
do
think
a
good
deal
about
it
i
am
glad
of
that
and
as
i
think
it
not
at
all
improbable
that
i
may
go
back
again
if
you
do
mind
it
i
will
refuse
of
course
after
that
the
duke
had
no
further
arguments
to
use
in
favour
of
sir
timothy
proposition
chapter
lxviii
brook
street
silverbridge
had
now
a
week
on
his
hands
which
he
felt
he
might
devote
to
the
lady
of
his
love
it
was
a
comfort
to
him
that
he
need
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
address
to
have
to
go
day
after
day
to
the
treasury
in
order
that
he
might
learn
his
lesson
would
have
been
disagreeable
to
him
he
did
not
quite
know
how
the
lesson
would
have
been
communicated
but
fancied
it
would
have
come
from
old
roby
whom
he
did
not
love
much
better
than
sir
timothy
then
the
speech
must
have
been
composed
and
afterwards
submitted
to
someone
probably
to
old
roby
again
by
whom
no
doubt
it
would
be
cut
and
slashed
and
made
quite
a
different
speech
than
he
had
intended
if
he
had
not
praised
sir
timothy
himself
roby
or
whatever
other
tutor
might
have
been
assigned
to
him
would
have
put
the
praise
in
and
then
how
many
hours
it
would
have
taken
to
learn
the
horrid
thing
by
heart
he
proudly
felt
that
he
had
not
been
prompted
by
idleness
to
decline
the
task
but
not
the
less
was
he
glad
to
have
shuffled
the
burden
from
off
his
shoulders
early
the
next
morning
he
was
in
brook
street
having
sent
a
note
to
say
he
would
call
and
having
even
named
the
hour
and
yet
when
he
knocked
at
the
door
he
was
told
with
the
utmost
indifference
by
a
london
footman
that
miss
boncassen
was
not
at
home
also
that
boncassen
was
not
at
home
also
that
boncassen
was
not
at
home
when
he
asked
at
what
hour
miss
boncassen
was
expected
home
the
man
answered
him
just
as
though
he
had
been
anybody
else
that
he
knew
nothing
about
it
he
turned
away
in
disgust
and
had
himself
driven
to
the
beargarden
in
his
misery
he
had
recourse
to
and
a
pint
of
champagne
for
his
lunch
halloa
old
fellow
what
is
this
i
hear
about
you
said
nidderdale
coming
in
and
sitting
opposite
to
him
i
do
know
what
you
have
heard
you
are
going
to
second
the
address
what
made
them
pick
you
out
from
the
lot
of
us
it
is
just
what
i
am
not
going
to
do
i
saw
it
all
in
the
papers
i
dare
say
and
yet
it
is
true
i
should
wonder
if
they
ask
you
at
this
moment
a
waiter
handed
a
large
official
letter
to
lord
nidderdale
saying
that
the
messenger
who
had
brought
it
was
waiting
for
an
answer
in
the
hall
the
letter
bore
the
important
signature
of
beeswax
on
the
corner
of
the
envelope
and
so
disturbed
lord
nidderdale
that
he
called
at
once
for
a
glass
of
when
opened
it
was
found
to
be
very
nearly
a
counterpart
of
that
which
silverbridge
had
received
down
in
the
country
there
was
however
added
a
little
prayer
that
lord
nidderdale
would
at
once
come
down
to
the
treasury
chambers
they
must
be
very
hard
up
said
lord
nidderdale
but
i
shall
do
it
cantrip
is
always
at
me
to
do
something
and
you
see
if
i
butter
them
up
properly
then
having
fortified
himself
with
and
a
glass
of
brown
sherry
he
went
away
at
once
to
the
treasury
chambers
silverbridge
felt
himself
a
little
better
after
his
lunch
better
still
when
he
had
smoked
a
couple
of
cigarettes
walking
about
the
empty
and
as
he
walked
he
collected
his
thoughts
she
could
hardly
have
meant
to
slight
him
no
doubt
her
letter
down
to
him
at
harrington
had
been
very
cold
no
doubt
he
had
been
in
being
sent
away
so
unceremoniously
from
the
door
but
yet
she
could
hardly
intend
that
everything
between
them
should
be
over
even
an
american
girl
could
not
be
so
unreasonable
as
that
he
remembered
the
passionate
way
in
which
she
had
assured
him
of
her
love
all
that
could
not
have
been
forgotten
he
had
done
nothing
by
which
he
could
have
forfeited
her
esteem
she
had
desired
him
to
tell
the
whole
affair
to
her
father
and
he
had
done
so
boncassen
might
perhaps
have
objected
it
might
be
that
this
american
was
so
prejudiced
against
english
aristocrats
as
to
desire
no
commerce
with
them
there
were
not
many
englishmen
who
would
not
have
welcomed
him
as
but
americans
might
be
different
still
still
isabel
would
hardly
have
shown
her
obedience
to
her
father
in
this
way
she
was
too
independent
to
obey
her
father
in
a
matter
concerning
her
own
heart
and
if
he
had
not
been
the
possessor
of
her
heart
at
that
last
interview
then
she
must
have
been
false
indeed
so
he
got
once
more
into
his
hansom
and
had
himself
taken
back
to
brook
street
boncassen
was
in
the
alone
i
am
so
sorry
said
the
lady
but
boncassen
has
i
think
just
gone
out
indeed
and
where
is
isabel
isabel
is
downstairs
that
is
if
she
has
gone
out
too
she
did
talk
of
going
with
her
father
to
the
museum
she
is
getting
quite
bookish
she
has
got
a
ticket
and
goes
there
and
has
all
the
things
brought
to
her
just
like
the
other
learned
folks
i
am
anxious
to
see
her
mrs
boncassen
my
if
she
has
gone
out
it
will
be
a
pity
she
was
only
saying
yesterday
she
would
wonder
if
you
should
turn
up
of
course
i
turned
up
boncassen
i
was
here
an
hour
ago
was
it
you
who
called
and
asked
all
them
questions
my
we
make
out
who
it
was
the
man
said
it
was
a
flurried
young
gentleman
who
would
leave
a
card
but
who
wanted
to
see
boncassen
most
especial
it
was
isabel
i
wanted
to
see
did
i
leave
a
card
no
i
think
i
did
i
felt
so
almost
at
home
that
i
did
think
of
a
card
that
very
kind
of
you
lord
silverbridge
i
hope
you
are
going
to
be
my
friend
mrs
boncassen
i
am
sure
i
do
know
lord
silverbridge
isabel
is
most
used
to
having
her
own
way
i
guess
i
think
when
hearts
are
joined
almost
nothing
ought
to
stand
between
them
but
boncassen
does
have
doubts
he
do
wish
as
isabel
should
force
herself
anywhere
but
here
she
is
and
now
she
can
speak
for
herself
whereupon
not
only
did
isabel
enter
the
room
but
at
the
same
time
boncassen
most
discreetly
left
it
it
must
be
confessed
that
american
mothers
are
not
afraid
of
their
daughters
silverbridge
when
the
door
was
closed
stood
looking
at
the
girl
for
a
moment
and
thought
that
she
was
more
lovely
than
ever
she
was
dressed
for
walking
she
still
had
on
her
fur
jacket
but
had
taken
off
her
hat
i
was
in
the
parlour
downstairs
she
said
when
you
came
in
with
papa
and
we
were
going
out
together
but
when
i
heard
who
was
here
i
made
him
go
alone
was
i
not
good
he
had
not
thought
of
a
word
to
say
or
a
thing
to
do
but
he
felt
as
he
looked
at
her
that
the
only
thing
in
the
world
worth
living
for
was
to
have
her
for
his
own
for
a
moment
he
was
half
abashed
then
in
the
next
she
was
close
in
his
arms
with
his
lips
pressed
to
hers
he
had
been
so
sudden
that
she
had
been
unable
at
any
rate
thought
that
she
had
been
unable
to
repress
him
lord
silverbridge
she
said
i
told
you
i
would
not
have
it
you
have
offended
me
isabel
yes
isabel
isabel
is
offended
with
you
why
did
you
do
it
why
did
he
do
it
it
seemed
to
him
to
be
the
most
unnecessary
question
i
want
you
to
know
how
i
love
you
will
that
tell
me
that
only
tells
me
how
little
you
think
of
me
then
it
tells
you
a
falsehood
for
i
am
thinking
of
you
always
and
i
always
think
of
you
as
being
the
best
and
dearest
and
sweetest
thing
in
the
world
and
now
i
think
you
dearer
and
sweeter
than
ever
upon
this
she
tried
to
frown
but
her
frown
at
once
broke
out
into
a
smile
when
i
wrote
to
say
that
i
was
coming
why
did
you
not
stay
at
home
for
me
this
morning
i
got
no
letter
lord
silverbridge
why
did
you
get
it
that
i
can
not
say
lord
silverbridge
isabel
if
you
are
so
formal
you
will
kill
me
lord
silverbridge
if
you
are
so
forward
you
will
offend
me
then
it
turned
out
that
no
letter
from
him
had
reached
the
house
and
as
the
letter
had
been
addressed
to
bruton
street
instead
of
brook
street
the
failure
on
the
part
of
the
was
not
surprising
whether
or
no
she
were
offended
or
he
killed
he
remained
with
her
the
whole
of
that
afternoon
of
course
i
love
you
she
said
do
you
suppose
i
should
be
here
with
you
if
i
did
not
or
that
you
could
have
remained
in
the
house
after
what
you
did
just
now
i
am
not
given
to
run
into
rhapsodies
quite
so
much
as
you
are
and
being
a
woman
perhaps
it
is
as
well
that
i
do
but
i
think
i
can
be
quite
as
true
to
you
as
you
are
to
me
i
am
so
much
obliged
to
you
for
that
he
said
grasping
at
her
hand
but
i
am
sure
that
rhapsodies
wo
do
any
good
now
i
tell
you
my
mind
you
know
mine
said
silverbridge
i
will
take
it
for
granted
that
i
do
your
mind
is
to
marry
me
will
ye
nill
ye
as
the
people
say
he
answered
this
by
merely
nodding
his
head
and
getting
a
little
nearer
to
her
that
is
all
very
well
in
its
way
and
i
am
not
going
to
say
but
what
i
am
gratified
then
he
did
grasp
her
hand
if
it
pleases
you
to
hear
me
say
so
lord
silverbridge
not
lord
then
i
shall
call
you
plantagenet
only
it
sounds
so
horribly
historical
why
are
you
not
thomas
or
abraham
but
if
it
will
please
you
to
hear
me
say
so
i
am
ready
to
acknowledge
that
nothing
in
all
my
life
ever
came
near
to
the
delight
i
have
in
your
love
hereupon
he
almost
succeeded
in
getting
his
arm
round
her
waist
but
she
was
strong
and
seized
his
hand
and
held
it
and
i
speak
no
rhapsodies
i
tell
you
a
truth
which
i
want
you
to
know
and
to
keep
in
your
heart
so
that
you
may
be
always
always
sure
of
it
i
never
will
doubt
it
but
that
marrying
will
ye
nill
ye
will
not
suit
me
there
is
so
much
wanted
for
happiness
in
life
i
will
do
all
that
i
can
yes
even
though
it
be
hazardous
i
am
willing
to
trust
you
if
you
were
as
other
men
are
if
you
could
do
as
you
please
as
lower
men
may
do
i
would
leave
father
and
mother
and
my
own
country
that
i
might
be
your
wife
i
would
do
that
because
i
love
you
but
what
will
my
life
be
here
if
they
who
are
your
friends
turn
their
backs
upon
me
what
will
your
life
be
if
through
all
that
you
continue
to
love
me
that
will
all
come
right
and
what
will
your
life
be
or
mine
she
said
going
on
with
her
own
thoughts
without
seeming
to
have
heard
his
last
words
if
in
such
a
condition
as
that
you
did
not
continue
to
love
me
i
should
always
love
you
it
might
be
very
hard
and
if
once
felt
to
be
hard
then
impossible
you
have
not
looked
at
it
as
i
have
done
why
should
you
even
with
a
wife
that
was
a
trouble
to
you
oh
isabel
his
arm
was
now
round
her
waist
but
she
continued
speaking
as
though
she
were
not
aware
of
the
embrace
yes
a
trouble
i
shall
not
be
always
just
what
i
am
now
now
i
can
be
bright
and
pretty
and
hold
my
own
with
others
because
i
am
so
but
are
you
sure
i
am
not
that
i
am
such
stuff
as
an
english
lady
should
be
made
of
if
in
ten
time
you
found
that
others
did
not
think
so
that
worse
again
you
did
not
think
so
yourself
would
you
be
true
to
me
then
i
will
always
be
true
to
you
she
gently
extricated
herself
as
though
she
had
done
so
that
she
might
better
turn
round
and
look
into
his
face
oh
my
own
one
who
can
say
of
himself
that
it
would
be
so
how
could
it
be
so
when
you
would
have
all
the
world
against
you
you
would
still
be
what
you
are
with
a
clog
round
your
leg
while
at
home
in
parliament
among
your
friends
at
your
clubs
you
would
be
just
what
you
are
you
would
be
that
lord
silverbridge
who
had
all
good
things
at
his
disposal
except
that
he
had
been
unfortunate
in
his
marriage
but
what
should
i
be
though
she
paused
he
could
not
answer
her
not
yet
there
was
a
solemnity
in
her
speech
which
made
it
necessary
that
he
should
hear
her
to
the
end
i
too
have
my
friends
in
my
own
country
it
is
no
disgrace
to
me
there
that
my
grandfather
worked
on
the
quays
no
one
holds
her
head
higher
than
i
do
or
is
more
sure
of
being
able
to
hold
it
i
have
there
that
assurance
of
esteem
and
honour
which
you
have
here
i
would
lose
it
all
to
do
you
a
good
but
i
will
not
lose
it
to
do
you
an
injury
i
do
know
about
injuries
he
said
getting
up
and
walking
about
the
room
but
i
am
sure
of
this
you
will
have
to
be
my
wife
if
your
father
will
take
me
by
the
hand
and
say
that
i
shall
be
his
daughter
i
will
risk
all
the
rest
even
then
it
might
not
be
wise
but
we
love
each
other
too
well
not
to
run
some
peril
do
you
think
that
i
want
anything
better
than
to
preside
in
your
home
to
soften
your
cares
to
welcome
your
joys
to
be
the
mother
perhaps
of
your
children
and
to
know
that
you
are
proud
that
i
should
be
so
no
my
darling
i
can
see
a
paradise
only
only
i
may
not
be
fit
to
enter
it
i
must
use
some
judgment
better
than
my
own
sounder
dear
than
yours
tell
the
duke
what
i
say
tell
him
with
what
language
a
son
may
use
to
his
father
and
remember
that
all
you
ask
for
yourself
you
will
ask
doubly
for
me
i
will
ask
him
so
that
he
can
not
refuse
me
if
you
do
i
shall
be
contented
and
now
go
i
have
said
ever
so
much
and
i
am
tired
isabel
oh
my
love
yes
isabel
your
love
i
am
that
at
any
rate
for
the
present
and
proud
to
be
so
as
a
queen
well
if
it
must
be
this
once
as
i
have
been
so
hard
to
you
then
she
gave
him
her
cheek
to
kiss
but
of
course
he
took
more
than
she
gave
when
he
got
out
into
the
street
it
was
dark
and
there
was
still
standing
the
faithful
cab
but
he
felt
that
at
the
present
moment
it
would
be
impossible
to
sit
still
and
he
dismissed
the
equipage
he
walked
rapidly
along
brook
street
into
park
lane
and
from
thence
to
the
park
hardly
knowing
whither
he
went
in
the
enthusiasm
of
the
moment
he
walked
back
to
the
marble
arch
and
thence
round
by
the
drive
to
the
guard
house
and
the
bridge
over
the
serpentine
by
the
knightsbridge
barracks
to
hyde
park
corner
though
he
should
give
up
everything
and
go
and
live
in
her
own
country
with
her
he
would
marry
her
his
politics
his
hunting
his
address
to
the
queen
his
horses
his
guns
his
father
wealth
and
his
own
rank
what
were
they
all
to
isabel
boncassen
in
meeting
her
he
had
met
the
one
human
being
in
all
the
world
who
could
really
be
anything
to
him
either
in
friendship
or
in
love
when
she
had
told
him
what
she
would
do
for
him
to
make
his
home
happy
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
all
other
delights
must
fade
away
from
him
for
ever
how
odious
were
tifto
and
his
racehorses
how
unmeaning
the
noise
of
his
club
how
terrible
the
tedium
of
those
parliamentary
benches
he
could
not
tell
his
love
as
she
had
told
hers
he
acknowledged
to
himself
that
his
words
could
not
be
as
her
words
nor
his
intellect
as
hers
but
his
heart
could
be
as
true
she
had
spoken
to
him
of
his
name
his
rank
and
all
his
outside
world
around
him
he
would
make
her
understand
at
last
that
they
were
nothing
to
him
in
comparison
with
her
when
he
had
got
round
to
hyde
park
corner
he
felt
that
he
was
almost
compelled
to
go
back
again
to
brook
street
in
no
other
place
could
there
be
anything
to
interest
him
nowhere
else
could
there
be
light
or
warmth
or
joy
but
what
would
she
think
of
him
to
go
back
hot
and
soiled
with
mud
in
order
that
he
might
say
one
more
adieu
that
possibly
he
might
ravish
one
more
kiss
would
hardly
be
manly
he
must
postpone
all
that
for
the
morrow
on
the
morrow
of
course
he
would
be
there
but
his
work
was
all
before
him
that
prayer
had
to
be
made
to
his
father
or
rather
some
wonderful
effort
of
eloquence
must
be
made
by
which
his
father
might
be
convinced
that
this
girl
was
so
infinitely
superior
to
anything
of
feminine
creation
that
had
ever
hitherto
been
seen
or
heard
of
that
all
ideas
as
to
birth
country
rank
or
name
ought
in
this
instance
to
count
for
nothing
he
did
believe
himself
that
he
had
found
such
a
pearl
that
no
question
of
setting
need
be
taken
into
consideration
if
the
duke
would
not
see
it
the
fault
would
be
in
the
duke
eyes
or
perhaps
in
his
own
words
but
certainly
not
in
the
pearl
then
he
compared
her
to
poor
lady
mabel
and
in
doing
so
did
arrive
at
something
near
the
truth
in
his
inward
delineation
of
the
two
characters
lady
mabel
with
all
her
grace
with
all
her
beauty
with
all
her
talent
was
a
creature
of
efforts
or
as
it
might
be
called
a
manufactured
article
she
strove
to
be
graceful
to
be
lovely
to
be
agreeable
and
clever
isabel
was
all
this
and
infinitely
more
without
any
struggle
when
he
was
most
fond
of
mabel
most
anxious
to
make
her
his
wife
there
had
always
been
present
to
him
a
feeling
that
she
was
old
though
he
knew
her
age
to
a
day
and
knew
her
to
be
younger
than
himself
yet
she
was
old
something
had
gone
of
her
native
bloom
something
had
been
scratched
and
chipped
from
the
first
fair
surface
and
this
had
been
repaired
by
varnish
and
veneering
though
he
had
loved
her
he
had
never
been
altogether
satisfied
with
her
but
isabel
was
as
young
as
hebe
he
knew
nothing
of
her
actual
years
but
he
did
know
that
to
have
seemed
younger
or
to
have
seemed
older
to
have
seemed
in
any
way
different
from
what
she
was
would
have
been
to
be
less
perfect
chapter
lxix
pert
poppet
on
a
sunday
morning
while
lord
silverbridge
was
alone
in
a
certain
apartment
in
the
house
in
carlton
terrace
which
was
called
his
own
the
name
was
brought
him
of
a
gentleman
who
was
anxious
to
see
him
he
had
seen
his
father
and
had
used
all
the
eloquence
of
which
he
was
master
but
not
quite
with
the
effect
which
he
had
desired
his
father
had
been
very
kind
but
he
too
had
been
eloquent
and
had
as
is
often
the
case
with
orators
been
apparently
more
moved
by
his
own
words
than
by
those
of
his
adversary
if
he
had
not
absolutely
declared
himself
as
irrevocably
hostile
to
miss
boncassen
he
had
not
said
a
word
that
might
be
supposed
to
give
token
of
assent
silverbridge
therefore
was
moody
contemplative
and
desirous
of
solitude
nothing
that
the
duke
had
said
had
shaken
him
he
was
still
sure
of
his
pearl
and
quite
determined
that
he
would
wear
it
various
thoughts
were
running
through
his
brain
what
if
he
were
to
abdicate
the
title
and
become
a
republican
he
was
inclined
to
think
that
he
could
not
abdicate
but
he
was
quite
sure
that
no
one
could
prevent
him
from
going
to
america
and
calling
himself
palliser
that
his
father
would
forgive
him
and
accept
the
brought
to
him
were
he
in
the
first
place
to
marry
without
sanction
he
felt
quite
sure
what
was
there
that
his
father
would
not
forgive
but
then
isabel
would
not
assent
to
this
he
was
turning
it
all
in
his
head
and
ever
and
anon
trying
to
relieve
his
mind
by
clarissa
which
he
was
reading
in
conformity
with
his
father
advice
when
the
gentleman
card
was
put
into
his
hand
whatever
does
he
want
here
he
said
to
himself
and
then
he
ordered
that
the
gentleman
might
be
shown
up
the
gentleman
in
question
was
our
old
friend
dolly
longstaff
dolly
longstaff
and
silverbridge
had
been
intimate
as
young
men
are
but
they
were
not
friends
nor
as
far
as
silverbridge
knew
had
dolly
ever
set
his
foot
in
that
house
before
well
dolly
said
he
what
the
matter
now
i
suppose
you
are
surprised
to
see
me
i
did
think
that
you
were
ever
up
so
early
it
was
at
this
time
almost
noon
oh
come
now
that
nonsense
i
can
get
up
as
early
as
anybody
else
i
have
changed
all
that
for
the
last
four
months
i
was
at
breakfast
this
morning
very
soon
after
ten
what
a
miracle
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
well
yes
there
is
of
course
you
are
surprised
to
see
me
you
never
were
here
before
and
therefore
it
is
odd
it
is
odd
i
felt
that
myself
and
when
i
tell
you
what
i
have
come
about
you
will
think
it
more
odd
i
know
i
can
trust
you
with
a
secret
that
depends
dolly
what
i
mean
is
i
know
you
are
there
are
ever
so
many
fellows
that
are
one
most
intimate
friends
that
would
say
anything
on
earth
they
could
that
was
i
hope
they
are
not
my
friends
oh
yes
they
are
think
of
glasslough
or
popplecourt
or
hindes
if
they
knew
anything
about
you
that
you
did
want
to
have
known
about
a
young
lady
or
anything
of
that
kind
do
you
think
they
tell
everybody
a
man
ca
tell
anything
he
does
know
that
true
i
had
thought
of
that
myself
but
then
there
a
particular
reason
for
my
telling
you
this
it
is
about
a
young
lady
you
wo
tell
will
you
no
i
wo
but
i
ca
see
why
on
earth
you
should
come
to
me
you
are
ever
so
many
years
older
than
i
am
i
had
thought
of
that
too
but
you
are
just
the
person
i
must
tell
i
want
you
to
help
me
these
last
words
were
said
in
a
whisper
and
dolly
as
he
said
them
had
drawn
nearer
to
his
friend
silverbridge
remained
in
suspense
saying
nothing
by
way
of
encouragement
dolly
either
in
love
with
his
own
mystery
or
doubtful
of
his
own
purpose
sat
still
looking
eagerly
at
his
companion
what
the
mischief
is
it
asked
silverbridge
impatiently
i
have
quite
made
up
my
own
mind
that
a
good
thing
at
any
rate
i
am
not
what
you
would
have
called
a
marrying
sort
of
man
i
should
have
said
no
but
i
suppose
most
men
do
marry
sooner
or
later
that
just
what
i
said
to
myself
it
has
to
be
done
you
know
there
are
three
different
properties
coming
to
me
at
least
one
has
come
already
you
a
lucky
fellow
i
made
up
my
mind
and
when
i
say
a
thing
i
mean
to
do
it
but
what
can
i
do
that
just
what
i
coming
to
if
a
man
does
marry
i
think
he
ought
to
be
attached
to
her
to
this
as
a
broad
proposition
silverbridge
was
ready
to
accede
but
regarding
dolly
as
a
sort
of
fellow
one
of
those
men
who
marry
because
it
is
convenient
to
have
a
house
kept
for
them
he
simply
nodded
his
head
i
am
awfully
attached
to
her
dolly
went
on
to
say
that
all
right
of
course
there
are
fellows
who
marry
girls
for
their
money
known
men
who
have
married
their
grandmothers
not
really
that
kind
of
thing
when
a
woman
is
old
it
does
not
much
matter
who
she
is
but
my
one
she
not
old
nor
rich
well
i
do
know
about
that
but
i
not
after
her
money
pray
understand
that
it
because
i
downright
fond
of
her
she
an
american
a
what
said
silverbridge
startled
you
know
her
that
the
reason
i
come
to
you
it
miss
boncassen
a
dark
frown
came
across
the
young
man
face
that
all
this
should
be
said
to
him
was
disgusting
that
an
owl
like
that
should
dare
to
talk
of
loving
miss
boncassen
was
offensive
to
him
it
because
you
know
her
that
i
come
to
you
she
thinks
that
you
after
her
dolly
as
he
said
this
lifted
himself
quickly
up
in
his
seat
and
nodded
his
head
mysteriously
as
he
looked
into
his
companion
face
it
was
as
much
as
though
he
should
say
i
see
you
are
surprised
but
so
it
is
then
he
went
on
she
does
the
pert
poppet
this
was
almost
too
much
for
silverbridge
but
still
he
contained
himself
she
wo
look
at
me
because
she
has
got
it
into
her
head
that
perhaps
some
day
she
may
be
duchess
of
omnium
that
of
course
is
out
of
the
question
upon
my
word
all
this
seems
to
me
to
be
so
very
very
distasteful
that
i
think
you
had
better
say
nothing
more
about
it
it
is
distasteful
said
dolly
but
the
truth
is
i
am
so
downright
what
you
may
call
enamoured
do
talk
such
stuff
as
that
here
said
silverbridge
jumping
up
i
wo
have
it
but
i
am
there
is
nothing
i
would
do
to
get
her
of
course
a
good
match
for
her
i
got
three
separate
properties
and
when
the
governor
goes
off
i
shall
have
a
clear
fifteen
thousand
a
year
oh
bother
of
course
that
nothing
to
you
but
it
is
a
very
tidy
income
for
a
commoner
and
how
is
she
to
do
better
i
do
know
how
she
could
do
much
worse
said
silverbridge
in
a
transport
of
rage
then
he
pulled
his
moustache
in
vexation
angry
with
himself
that
he
should
have
allowed
himself
to
say
even
a
word
on
so
preposterous
a
supposition
isabel
boncassen
and
dolly
longstaff
it
was
titania
and
bottom
over
again
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
he
should
get
rid
of
this
intruder
and
he
began
to
be
afraid
that
he
could
not
do
this
without
using
language
which
would
be
uncivil
upon
my
word
he
said
i
think
you
had
better
not
talk
about
it
any
more
the
young
lady
is
one
for
whom
i
have
a
very
great
respect
i
mean
to
marry
her
said
dolly
thinking
thus
to
vindicate
himself
you
might
as
well
think
of
marrying
one
of
the
stars
one
of
the
stars
or
a
royal
princess
well
perhaps
that
is
your
opinion
but
i
ca
say
that
i
agree
with
you
i
do
see
why
she
should
take
me
i
can
give
her
a
position
which
you
may
call
al
out
of
the
peerage
i
can
bring
her
into
society
i
can
make
an
english
lady
of
her
you
ca
make
anything
of
her
except
to
insult
her
and
me
too
by
talking
of
her
i
do
quite
understand
this
said
the
unfortunate
lover
getting
up
from
his
seat
very
likely
she
wo
have
me
perhaps
she
has
told
you
so
she
never
mentioned
your
name
to
me
in
her
life
i
do
suppose
she
remembers
your
existence
but
i
say
that
there
can
be
no
insult
in
such
a
one
as
me
asking
such
a
one
as
her
to
be
my
wife
to
say
that
she
does
remember
my
existence
is
absurd
why
should
i
be
troubled
with
all
this
because
i
think
you
making
a
fool
of
her
and
because
i
honest
that
why
said
dolly
with
much
energy
there
was
something
in
this
which
partly
reconciled
silverbridge
to
his
despised
rival
there
was
a
touch
of
truth
about
the
man
though
he
was
so
utterly
mistaken
in
his
ideas
i
want
you
to
give
over
in
order
that
i
may
try
again
i
do
think
you
ought
to
keep
a
girl
from
her
promotion
merely
for
the
fun
of
a
flirtation
perhaps
you
fond
of
her
but
you
marry
her
i
am
fond
of
her
and
i
shall
after
a
minute
pause
silverbridge
resolved
that
he
would
be
magnanimous
miss
boncassen
is
going
to
be
my
wife
he
said
your
wife
yes
my
wife
and
now
i
think
you
will
see
that
nothing
further
can
be
said
about
this
matter
duchess
of
omnium
she
will
be
lady
silverbridge
oh
of
course
she
be
that
first
then
i
got
nothing
further
to
say
i
not
going
to
enter
myself
to
run
against
you
only
i
should
have
believed
it
if
anybody
else
had
told
me
such
is
my
good
fortune
oh
ah
yes
of
course
that
is
one
way
of
looking
at
it
well
silverbridge
i
tell
you
what
i
shall
do
i
shall
hook
it
no
no
not
you
yes
i
shall
i
dare
say
you
wo
believe
me
but
i
got
such
a
feeling
about
me
here
as
he
said
this
he
laid
his
hand
upon
his
heart
that
if
i
stayed
i
should
go
in
for
hard
drinking
i
shall
take
the
great
asiatic
tour
i
know
a
fellow
that
wants
to
go
but
he
has
got
any
money
i
dare
say
i
shall
be
off
before
the
end
of
next
month
you
do
know
any
fellow
that
would
buy
hunters
do
you
silverbridge
shook
his
head
said
dolly
in
a
melancholy
tone
i
am
sure
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
telling
me
if
i
known
you
meant
it
i
should
have
meddled
of
course
duchess
of
omnium
look
here
dolly
i
have
told
you
what
i
should
not
have
told
any
one
but
i
wanted
to
screen
the
young
lady
name
it
was
so
kind
of
you
do
not
repeat
it
it
is
a
kind
of
thing
that
ladies
are
particular
about
they
choose
their
own
time
for
letting
everybody
know
then
dolly
promised
to
be
as
mute
as
a
fish
and
took
his
departure
silverbridge
had
felt
towards
the
end
of
the
interview
that
he
had
been
arrogant
to
the
unfortunate
man
particularly
in
saying
that
the
young
lady
would
not
remember
the
existence
of
such
a
suitor
and
had
also
recognised
a
certain
honesty
in
the
purpose
which
had
not
been
the
less
honest
because
it
was
so
absurd
actuated
by
the
consciousness
of
this
he
had
swallowed
his
anger
and
had
told
the
whole
truth
nevertheless
things
had
been
said
which
were
horrible
to
him
this
buffoon
of
a
man
had
called
his
isabel
a
pert
poppet
how
was
he
to
get
over
the
remembrance
of
such
an
offence
and
then
the
wretch
had
declared
that
he
was
enamoured
there
was
sacrilege
in
the
term
when
applied
by
such
a
man
to
isabel
boncassen
he
had
thoughts
of
days
to
come
when
everything
would
be
settled
when
he
might
sit
close
to
her
and
call
her
pretty
names
when
he
might
in
sweet
familiarity
tell
her
that
she
was
a
little
yankee
and
a
fierce
republican
and
chaff
her
about
the
stars
and
stripes
and
then
as
he
pictured
the
scene
to
himself
in
his
imagination
she
would
lean
upon
him
and
would
give
him
back
his
chaff
and
would
call
him
an
aristocrat
and
would
laugh
at
his
titles
as
he
thought
of
all
this
he
would
be
proud
with
the
feeling
that
such
privileges
would
be
his
own
and
now
this
wretched
man
had
called
her
a
pert
poppet
there
was
a
sanctity
about
her
a
divinity
which
made
it
almost
a
profanity
to
have
talked
about
her
at
all
to
such
a
one
as
dolly
longstaff
she
was
his
holy
of
holies
at
which
vulgar
eyes
should
not
even
be
allowed
to
gaze
it
had
been
a
most
unfortunate
interview
but
this
was
clear
that
as
he
had
announced
his
engagement
to
such
a
one
as
dolly
longstaff
the
matter
now
would
admit
of
no
delay
he
would
explain
to
his
father
that
as
tidings
of
the
engagement
had
got
abroad
honour
to
the
young
lady
would
compel
him
to
come
forward
openly
as
her
suitor
at
once
if
this
argument
might
serve
him
then
perhaps
this
intrusion
would
not
have
been
altogether
a
misfortune
chapter
lxx
love
may
be
a
great
misfortune
silverbridge
when
he
reached
brook
street
that
day
was
surprised
to
find
that
a
large
party
was
going
to
lunch
there
isabel
had
asked
him
to
come
and
he
had
thought
her
the
dearest
girl
in
the
world
for
doing
so
but
now
his
gratitude
for
that
favour
was
considerably
abated
he
did
not
care
just
now
for
the
honour
of
eating
his
lunch
in
the
presence
of
gotobed
the
american
minister
whom
he
found
there
already
in
the
with
gotobed
nor
with
ezekiel
sevenkings
the
great
american
poet
from
the
far
west
who
sat
silent
and
stared
at
him
in
an
unpleasant
way
when
sir
timothy
beeswax
was
announced
with
lady
beeswax
and
her
daughter
his
gratification
certainly
was
not
increased
and
the
last
comer
who
did
not
arrive
indeed
till
they
were
all
seated
at
the
table
almost
made
him
start
from
his
chair
and
take
his
departure
suddenly
that
last
comer
was
no
other
than
adolphus
longstaff
as
it
happened
he
was
seated
next
to
dolly
with
lady
beeswax
on
the
other
side
of
him
whereas
his
holy
of
holies
was
on
the
other
side
of
dolly
the
arrangement
made
seemed
to
him
to
have
been
monstrous
he
had
endeavoured
to
get
next
to
isabel
but
she
had
so
manoeuvred
that
there
should
be
a
vacant
chair
between
them
he
had
not
much
regarded
this
because
a
vacant
chair
may
be
pushed
on
one
side
but
before
he
had
made
all
his
calculations
dolly
longstaff
was
sitting
there
he
almost
thought
that
dolly
winked
at
him
in
triumph
that
very
dolly
who
an
hour
ago
had
promised
to
take
himself
off
upon
his
asiatic
travels
sir
timothy
and
the
minister
kept
up
the
conversation
very
much
between
them
sir
timothy
flattering
everything
that
was
american
and
the
minister
finding
fault
with
very
many
things
that
were
english
now
and
then
boncassen
would
put
in
a
word
to
soften
the
severe
honesty
of
his
countryman
or
to
correct
the
euphemistic
falsehoods
of
sir
timothy
the
poet
seemed
always
to
be
biding
his
time
dolly
ventured
to
whisper
a
word
to
his
neighbour
it
was
but
to
say
that
the
frost
had
broken
up
but
silverbridge
heard
it
and
looked
daggers
at
everyone
then
lady
beeswax
expressed
to
him
a
hope
that
he
was
going
to
do
great
things
in
parliament
this
session
i
do
mean
to
go
near
the
place
he
said
not
at
all
conveying
any
purpose
to
which
he
had
really
come
but
driven
by
the
stress
of
the
moment
to
say
something
that
should
express
his
general
hatred
of
everybody
lupton
was
there
on
the
other
side
of
isabel
and
was
soon
engaged
with
her
in
a
pleasant
familiar
conversation
then
silverbridge
remembered
that
he
had
always
thought
lupton
to
be
a
most
conceited
prig
nobody
gave
himself
so
many
airs
or
was
so
careful
as
to
the
dyeing
of
his
whiskers
it
was
astonishing
that
isabel
should
allow
herself
to
be
amused
by
such
an
antiquated
coxcomb
when
they
had
finished
eating
they
moved
about
and
changed
their
places
boncassen
being
rather
anxious
to
stop
the
flood
of
american
eloquence
which
came
from
his
friend
gotobed
british
viands
had
become
subject
to
his
criticism
and
gotobed
had
declared
to
lupton
that
he
did
believe
that
london
could
produce
a
dish
of
squash
or
tomatoes
he
was
quite
sure
you
have
sweet
corn
then
there
had
been
a
moving
of
seats
in
which
the
minister
was
shuffled
off
to
lady
beeswax
and
the
poet
found
himself
by
the
side
of
isabel
do
you
not
regret
our
mountains
and
our
prairies
said
the
poet
our
great
waters
and
our
green
savannahs
i
think
more
perhaps
of
fifth
avenue
said
miss
boncassen
silverbridge
who
at
this
moment
was
being
interrogated
by
sir
timothy
heard
every
word
of
it
i
was
so
sorry
lord
silverbridge
said
sir
timothy
that
you
could
not
accede
to
our
little
request
i
did
not
quite
see
my
way
said
silverbridge
with
his
eye
upon
isabel
so
i
understood
but
i
hope
that
things
will
make
themselves
clearer
to
you
shortly
there
is
nothing
that
i
desire
so
much
as
the
support
of
young
men
such
as
yourself
the
very
cream
i
may
say
of
the
whole
country
it
is
to
the
young
conservative
thoughtfulness
and
the
truly
british
spirit
of
our
springing
aristocracy
that
i
look
for
that
reaction
which
i
am
sure
will
at
last
carry
us
safely
over
the
rocks
and
shoals
of
communistic
propensities
i
should
wonder
if
it
did
said
silverbridge
they
did
think
that
he
was
going
to
remain
down
there
talking
politics
to
an
old
humbug
like
sir
timothy
when
the
sun
and
moon
and
all
the
stars
had
gone
up
into
the
for
at
that
moment
isabel
was
making
her
way
to
the
door
but
sir
timothy
had
buttonholed
him
of
course
it
is
late
now
to
say
anything
further
about
the
address
we
have
arranged
that
not
quite
as
i
would
have
wished
for
i
had
set
my
heart
upon
initiating
you
into
the
rapturous
pleasure
of
parliamentary
debate
but
i
hope
that
a
good
time
is
coming
and
pray
remember
this
lord
silverbridge
there
is
no
member
sitting
on
our
side
of
the
house
and
i
need
hardly
say
on
the
other
whom
i
would
go
farther
to
oblige
than
your
father
son
i
sure
that
very
kind
said
silverbridge
absolutely
using
a
little
force
as
he
disengaged
himself
then
he
at
once
followed
the
ladies
upstairs
passing
the
poet
on
the
stairs
you
have
hardly
spoken
to
me
he
whispered
to
isabel
he
knew
that
to
whisper
to
her
now
with
the
eyes
of
many
upon
him
with
the
ears
of
many
open
was
an
absurdity
but
he
could
not
refrain
himself
there
are
so
many
to
be
entertained
as
people
say
i
do
think
i
ought
to
have
to
entertain
you
she
answered
laughing
no
one
heard
her
but
silverbridge
yet
she
did
not
seem
to
whisper
she
left
him
however
at
once
and
was
soon
engaged
in
conversation
with
sir
timothy
a
convivial
lunch
i
hold
to
be
altogether
bad
but
the
worst
of
its
many
evils
is
that
vacillating
mind
which
does
not
know
when
to
take
its
owner
off
silverbridge
was
on
this
occasion
quite
determined
not
to
take
himself
off
at
all
as
it
was
only
a
lunch
the
people
must
go
and
then
he
would
be
left
with
isabel
but
the
vacillation
of
the
others
was
distressing
to
him
lupton
went
and
poor
dolly
got
away
apparently
without
a
word
but
the
beeswaxes
and
the
gotobeds
would
not
go
and
the
poet
sat
staring
immovably
in
the
meanwhile
silverbridge
endeavoured
to
make
the
time
pass
lightly
by
talking
to
boncassen
he
had
been
so
determined
to
accept
isabel
with
all
her
adjuncts
that
he
had
come
almost
to
like
boncassen
and
would
certainly
have
taken
her
part
violently
had
any
one
spoken
ill
of
her
in
his
presence
then
suddenly
he
found
that
the
room
was
nearly
empty
the
beeswaxes
and
the
gotobeds
were
gone
and
at
last
the
poet
himself
with
a
final
glare
of
admiration
at
isabel
had
taken
his
departure
when
silverbridge
looked
round
isabel
also
was
gone
then
too
boncassen
had
left
the
room
suddenly
at
the
same
instant
boncassen
entered
by
another
door
and
the
two
men
were
alone
together
my
dear
lord
silverbridge
said
the
father
i
want
to
have
a
few
words
with
you
of
course
there
was
nothing
for
him
but
to
submit
you
remember
what
you
said
to
me
down
at
matching
oh
yes
i
remember
that
you
did
me
the
great
honour
of
expressing
a
wish
to
make
my
child
your
wife
i
was
asking
for
a
very
great
favour
that
also
for
there
is
no
greater
favour
i
could
do
to
any
man
than
to
give
him
my
daughter
nevertheless
you
were
doing
me
a
great
honour
and
you
did
it
as
you
do
everything
with
an
honest
grace
that
went
far
to
win
my
heart
i
am
not
at
all
surprised
sir
that
you
should
have
won
hers
the
young
man
as
he
heard
this
could
only
blush
and
look
foolish
if
i
know
my
girl
neither
your
money
nor
your
title
would
go
for
anything
i
think
much
more
of
her
love
boncassen
than
i
do
of
anything
else
in
the
world
but
love
my
lord
may
be
a
great
misfortune
as
he
said
this
the
tone
of
his
voice
was
altered
and
there
was
a
melancholy
solemnity
not
only
in
his
words
but
in
his
countenance
i
take
it
that
young
people
when
they
love
rarely
think
of
more
than
the
present
moment
if
they
did
so
the
bloom
would
be
gone
from
their
romance
but
others
have
to
do
this
for
them
if
isabel
had
come
to
me
saying
that
she
loved
a
poor
man
there
would
not
have
been
much
to
disquiet
me
a
poor
man
may
earn
bread
for
himself
and
his
wife
and
if
he
failed
i
could
have
found
them
bread
nor
had
she
loved
somewhat
below
her
own
degree
should
i
have
opposed
her
so
long
as
her
husband
had
been
an
educated
man
there
might
have
been
no
future
punishment
to
fear
i
do
think
she
could
have
done
that
said
silverbridge
at
any
rate
she
has
not
done
so
but
how
am
i
to
look
upon
this
that
she
has
done
i
do
my
best
for
her
mr
boncassen
i
believe
you
would
but
even
your
love
ca
make
her
an
englishwoman
you
can
make
her
a
duchess
not
that
sir
but
you
ca
give
her
a
parentage
fit
for
a
duchess
not
fit
at
least
in
the
opinion
of
those
with
whom
you
will
pass
your
life
with
whom
or
perhaps
without
whom
she
will
be
destined
to
pass
her
life
if
she
becomes
your
wife
unfortunately
it
does
not
suffice
that
you
should
think
it
fit
though
you
loved
each
other
as
well
as
any
man
and
woman
that
ever
were
brought
into
each
other
arms
by
the
beneficence
of
god
you
can
not
make
her
happy
unless
you
can
assure
her
the
respect
of
those
around
her
all
the
world
will
respect
her
her
conduct
yes
i
think
the
world
your
world
would
learn
to
do
that
i
do
not
think
it
could
help
itself
but
that
would
not
suffice
i
may
respect
the
man
who
cleans
my
boots
but
he
would
be
a
wretched
man
if
he
were
thrown
on
me
for
society
i
would
not
give
him
my
society
will
your
duchesses
and
your
countesses
give
her
theirs
certainly
they
will
i
do
not
ask
for
it
as
thinking
it
to
be
of
more
value
than
that
of
others
but
were
she
to
become
your
wife
she
would
be
so
abnormally
placed
as
to
require
it
for
her
comfort
she
would
have
become
a
lady
of
high
rank
not
because
she
loves
rank
but
because
she
loves
you
yes
yes
yes
said
silverbridge
hardly
himself
knowing
why
he
became
impetuous
but
having
removed
herself
into
that
position
being
as
she
would
be
a
countess
or
a
duchess
or
what
not
how
could
she
be
happy
if
she
were
excluded
from
the
community
of
countesses
and
duchesses
they
are
not
like
that
said
silverbridge
i
will
not
say
that
they
are
but
i
do
not
know
having
anglican
tendencies
i
have
been
wont
to
contradict
my
countrymen
when
they
have
told
me
of
the
narrow
exclusiveness
of
your
nobles
having
found
your
nobles
and
your
commoners
all
alike
in
their
courtesy
which
is
a
cold
word
in
their
hospitable
friendships
i
would
now
not
only
contradict
but
would
laugh
to
scorn
any
such
charge
so
far
he
spoke
somewhat
loudly
and
then
dropped
his
voice
as
he
concluded
were
it
anything
less
than
the
happiness
of
my
child
that
is
in
question
what
am
i
to
say
sir
i
only
know
this
i
am
not
going
to
lose
her
you
are
a
fine
fellow
i
was
going
to
say
that
i
wished
you
were
an
american
so
that
isabel
need
not
lose
you
but
my
boy
i
have
told
you
that
i
do
not
know
how
it
might
be
of
all
whom
you
know
who
could
best
tell
me
the
truth
on
such
a
subject
who
is
there
whose
age
will
have
given
him
experience
whose
rank
will
have
made
him
familiar
with
this
matter
who
from
friendship
to
you
would
be
least
likely
to
decide
against
your
wishes
who
from
his
own
native
honesty
would
be
most
sure
to
tell
the
truth
you
mean
my
father
said
silverbridge
i
do
mean
your
father
happily
he
has
taken
no
dislike
to
the
girl
herself
i
have
seen
enough
of
him
to
feel
sure
that
he
is
devoted
to
his
own
children
indeed
he
is
a
just
and
a
liberal
man
one
i
should
say
not
carried
away
by
prejudices
well
my
girl
and
i
have
just
put
our
heads
together
and
we
have
come
to
a
conclusion
if
the
duke
of
omnium
will
tell
us
that
she
would
be
safe
as
your
wife
safe
from
the
contempt
of
those
around
her
you
shall
have
her
and
i
shall
rejoice
to
give
her
to
you
not
because
you
are
lord
silverbridge
not
because
of
your
rank
and
wealth
but
because
you
are
that
individual
human
being
whom
i
now
hold
by
the
hand
when
the
american
had
come
to
an
end
silverbridge
was
too
much
moved
to
make
any
immediate
answer
he
had
an
idea
in
his
own
mind
that
the
appeal
was
not
altogether
fair
his
father
was
a
just
man
just
affectionate
and
liberal
but
then
it
will
so
often
happen
that
fathers
do
not
want
their
sons
to
marry
those
very
girls
on
whom
the
sons
have
set
their
hearts
he
could
only
say
that
he
would
speak
to
his
father
again
on
the
subject
let
him
tell
me
that
he
is
contented
said
boncassen
and
i
will
tell
him
that
i
am
contented
now
my
friend
silverbridge
begged
that
he
might
be
allowed
to
see
isabel
before
he
was
turned
out
but
isabel
had
left
the
house
in
company
with
her
mother
chapter
lxxi
what
am
i
to
say
sir
when
silverbridge
left
boncassen
house
he
was
resolved
to
go
to
his
father
without
an
hour
delay
and
represent
to
the
duke
exactly
how
the
case
stood
he
would
be
urgent
piteous
submissive
and
eloquent
in
any
other
matter
he
would
promise
to
make
whatever
arrangements
his
father
might
desire
he
would
make
his
father
understand
that
all
his
happiness
depended
on
this
marriage
when
once
married
he
would
settle
down
even
at
gatherum
castle
if
the
duke
should
wish
it
he
would
not
think
of
he
would
desert
the
beargarden
he
would
learn
by
heart
and
only
do
as
much
shooting
and
hunting
as
would
become
a
young
nobleman
in
his
position
all
this
he
would
say
as
eagerly
and
as
pleasantly
as
it
might
be
said
but
he
would
add
to
all
this
an
assurance
of
his
unchangeable
intention
it
was
his
purpose
to
marry
isabel
boncassen
if
he
could
do
this
with
his
father
good
will
so
best
but
at
any
rate
he
would
marry
her
the
world
at
this
time
was
altogether
busy
with
political
rumours
and
it
was
supposed
that
sir
timothy
beeswax
would
do
something
very
clever
it
was
supposed
also
that
he
would
sever
himself
from
some
of
his
present
companions
on
that
point
everybody
was
agreed
and
on
that
point
only
everybody
was
right
lord
drummond
who
was
the
titular
prime
minister
and
sir
timothy
had
during
a
considerable
part
of
the
last
session
and
through
the
whole
vacation
so
belarded
each
other
with
praise
in
all
their
public
expressions
that
it
was
quite
manifest
that
they
had
quarrelled
when
any
body
of
statesmen
make
public
asseverations
by
one
or
various
voices
that
there
is
no
discord
among
them
not
a
dissentient
voice
on
any
subject
people
are
apt
to
suppose
that
they
can
not
hang
together
much
longer
it
is
the
man
who
has
no
peace
at
home
that
declares
abroad
that
his
wife
is
an
angel
he
who
lives
on
comfortable
terms
with
the
partner
of
his
troubles
can
afford
to
acknowledge
the
ordinary
rubs
of
life
old
mildmay
who
was
prime
minister
for
so
many
years
and
whom
his
party
worshipped
used
to
say
that
he
had
never
found
a
gentleman
who
had
quite
agreed
with
him
all
round
but
sir
timothy
has
always
been
in
exact
accord
with
all
his
colleagues
till
he
has
left
them
or
they
him
never
had
there
been
such
concord
as
of
late
and
men
clubs
and
newspapers
now
protested
that
as
a
natural
consequence
there
would
soon
be
a
but
not
on
that
account
would
it
perhaps
be
necessary
that
sir
timothy
should
resign
or
not
necessary
that
his
resignation
should
be
permanent
the
conservative
majority
had
dwindled
but
still
there
was
a
majority
it
certainly
was
the
case
that
lord
drummond
could
not
get
on
without
sir
timothy
but
might
it
not
be
possible
that
sir
timothy
should
get
on
without
lord
drummond
if
so
he
must
begin
his
action
in
this
direction
by
resigning
he
would
have
to
place
his
resignation
no
doubt
with
infinite
regret
in
the
hands
of
lord
drummond
but
if
such
a
step
were
to
be
taken
now
just
as
parliament
was
about
to
assemble
what
would
become
of
the
speech
of
the
address
and
of
the
noble
peers
and
noble
and
other
commoners
who
were
to
propose
and
second
it
in
the
two
houses
of
parliament
there
were
those
who
said
that
such
a
trick
played
at
the
last
moment
would
be
very
shabby
but
then
again
there
were
those
who
foresaw
that
the
shabbiness
would
be
made
to
rest
anywhere
rather
than
on
the
shoulders
of
sir
timothy
if
it
should
turn
out
that
he
had
striven
manfully
to
make
things
run
smoothly
that
the
incompetence
or
the
chancellor
obstinacy
or
this
or
that
secretary
peculiarity
of
temper
had
done
it
all
might
not
sir
timothy
then
be
able
to
emerge
from
the
confused
flood
and
swim
along
pleasantly
with
his
head
higher
than
ever
above
the
waters
in
these
great
matters
parliamentary
management
goes
for
so
much
if
a
man
be
really
clever
and
handy
at
his
trade
if
he
can
work
hard
and
knows
what
he
is
about
if
he
can
give
and
take
and
be
not
or
if
he
can
ask
pardon
for
a
peccadillo
and
seem
to
be
sorry
with
a
good
grace
if
above
all
things
he
be
able
to
surround
himself
with
the
prestige
of
success
then
so
much
will
be
forgiven
him
great
gifts
of
eloquence
are
hardly
wanted
or
a
patriotism
which
is
capable
of
strong
indignation
a
party
has
to
be
managed
and
he
who
can
manage
it
best
will
probably
be
its
best
leader
the
subordinate
task
of
legislation
and
of
executive
government
may
well
fall
into
the
inferior
hands
of
less
astute
practitioners
it
was
admitted
on
both
sides
that
there
was
no
man
like
sir
timothy
for
managing
the
house
or
coercing
a
party
and
there
was
therefore
a
general
feeling
that
it
would
be
a
pity
that
sir
timothy
should
be
squeezed
out
he
knew
all
the
little
secrets
of
the
business
could
arrange
let
the
cause
be
what
it
might
to
get
a
full
house
for
himself
and
his
friends
and
empty
benches
for
his
opponents
could
foresee
a
thousand
little
things
to
which
even
a
walpole
would
have
been
blind
which
a
pitt
would
not
have
condescended
to
regard
but
with
which
his
familiarity
made
him
a
very
comfortable
leader
of
the
house
of
commons
there
were
various
ideas
prevalent
as
to
the
politics
of
the
coming
session
but
the
prevailing
idea
was
in
favour
of
sir
timothy
the
duke
was
at
longroyston
the
seat
of
his
old
political
ally
the
duke
of
bungay
and
had
been
absent
from
sunday
the
till
the
morning
of
friday
the
on
which
day
parliament
was
to
meet
on
that
morning
at
about
noon
a
letter
came
to
the
son
saying
that
his
father
had
returned
and
would
be
glad
to
see
him
silverbridge
was
going
to
the
house
on
that
day
and
was
not
without
his
own
political
anxieties
if
lord
drummond
remained
in
he
thought
that
he
must
for
the
present
stand
by
the
party
which
he
had
adopted
if
however
sir
timothy
should
become
prime
minister
there
would
be
a
loophole
for
escape
there
were
some
three
or
four
besides
himself
who
detested
sir
timothy
and
in
such
case
he
might
perhaps
have
company
in
his
desertion
all
this
was
on
his
mind
but
through
all
this
he
was
aware
that
there
was
a
matter
of
much
deeper
moment
which
required
his
energies
when
his
father
message
was
brought
to
him
he
told
himself
at
once
that
now
was
the
time
for
his
eloquence
well
silverbridge
said
the
duke
how
are
matters
going
on
with
you
there
seemed
to
be
something
in
his
father
manner
more
than
ordinarily
jocund
and
with
me
sir
i
do
mean
to
ask
any
party
secrets
if
you
and
sir
timothy
understand
each
other
of
course
you
will
be
discreet
i
ca
be
discreet
sir
because
i
do
know
anything
about
him
when
i
heard
said
the
duke
smiling
of
your
being
in
close
conference
with
sir
timothy
i
sir
yes
you
boncassen
told
me
that
you
and
he
were
so
deeply
taken
up
with
each
other
at
his
house
that
nobody
could
get
a
word
with
either
of
you
have
you
seen
mr
boncassen
asked
the
son
whose
attention
was
immediately
diverted
from
his
father
political
badinage
yes
i
have
seen
him
i
happened
to
meet
him
where
i
was
dining
last
sunday
and
he
walked
home
with
me
he
was
so
intent
upon
what
he
was
saying
that
i
fear
he
allowed
me
to
take
him
out
of
his
way
what
was
he
talking
about
said
silverbridge
all
his
preparations
all
his
eloquence
all
his
method
now
seemed
to
have
departed
from
him
he
was
talking
about
you
said
the
duke
he
had
told
me
that
he
wanted
to
see
you
what
did
he
say
sir
i
suppose
you
can
guess
what
he
said
he
wished
to
know
what
i
thought
of
the
offer
you
have
made
to
his
daughter
the
great
subject
had
come
up
so
easily
so
readily
that
he
was
almost
aghast
when
he
found
himself
in
the
middle
of
it
and
yet
he
must
speak
of
the
matter
and
that
at
once
i
hope
you
raised
no
objection
sir
he
said
the
objection
came
mainly
from
him
and
i
am
bound
to
say
that
every
word
that
fell
from
him
was
spoken
with
wisdom
but
still
he
asked
you
to
consent
by
no
means
he
told
me
his
opinion
and
then
he
asked
me
a
question
i
am
sure
he
did
not
say
that
we
ought
not
to
be
married
he
did
say
that
he
thought
you
ought
not
to
be
married
if
if
what
sir
if
there
were
probability
that
his
daughter
would
not
be
well
received
as
your
wife
then
he
asked
me
what
would
be
my
reception
of
her
silverbridge
looked
up
into
his
father
face
with
beseeching
imploring
eyes
as
though
everything
now
depended
on
the
next
few
words
that
he
might
utter
i
shall
think
it
an
unwise
marriage
continued
the
duke
silverbridge
when
he
heard
this
at
once
knew
that
he
had
gained
his
cause
his
father
had
spoken
of
the
marriage
as
a
thing
that
was
to
happen
a
joyous
light
dawned
in
his
eyes
and
the
look
of
pain
went
from
his
brow
all
which
the
duke
was
not
slow
to
perceive
i
shall
think
it
an
unwise
marriage
he
continued
repeating
his
words
but
i
was
bound
to
tell
him
that
were
miss
boncassen
to
become
your
wife
she
would
also
become
my
daughter
oh
sir
i
told
him
why
the
marriage
would
be
distasteful
to
me
whether
i
may
be
wrong
or
right
i
think
it
to
be
for
the
good
of
our
country
for
the
good
of
our
order
for
the
good
of
our
individual
families
that
we
should
support
each
other
by
marriage
it
is
not
as
though
we
were
a
narrow
class
already
too
closely
bound
together
by
family
alliances
the
room
for
choice
might
be
wide
enough
for
you
without
going
across
the
atlantic
to
look
for
her
who
is
to
be
the
mother
of
your
children
to
this
boncassen
replied
that
he
was
to
look
solely
to
his
daughter
happiness
he
meant
me
to
understand
that
he
cared
nothing
for
my
feelings
why
should
he
that
which
to
me
is
deep
wisdom
is
to
him
an
empty
prejudice
he
asked
me
then
how
others
would
receive
her
i
am
sure
that
everybody
would
like
her
said
silverbridge
i
like
her
i
like
her
very
much
i
am
so
glad
but
still
all
this
is
a
sorrow
to
me
when
however
he
put
that
question
to
me
about
the
world
around
her
as
to
those
among
whom
her
lot
would
be
cast
i
could
not
say
that
i
thought
she
would
be
rejected
oh
no
the
idea
of
rejecting
isabel
she
has
a
brightness
and
a
grace
all
her
own
continued
the
duke
which
will
ensure
her
acceptance
in
all
societies
yes
yes
it
is
just
that
sir
you
will
be
a
nine
days
wonder
the
foolish
young
nobleman
who
chose
to
marry
an
american
i
think
it
will
be
just
the
other
way
up
sir
among
the
men
but
her
place
will
i
think
be
secure
to
her
that
is
what
i
told
mr
boncassen
it
is
all
right
with
him
then
now
if
you
call
it
all
right
you
will
understand
of
course
that
you
are
acting
in
opposition
to
my
advice
and
my
wishes
what
am
i
to
say
sir
exclaimed
silverbridge
almost
in
despair
when
i
love
the
girl
better
than
my
life
and
when
you
tell
me
that
she
can
be
mine
if
i
choose
to
take
her
when
i
have
asked
her
to
be
my
wife
and
have
got
her
to
say
that
she
likes
me
when
her
father
has
given
way
and
all
the
rest
of
it
would
it
be
possible
that
i
should
say
now
that
i
will
give
her
up
my
opinion
is
to
go
for
nothing
in
anything
the
duke
as
he
said
this
knew
that
he
was
expressing
aloud
a
feeling
which
should
have
been
restrained
within
his
own
bosom
it
was
natural
that
there
should
have
been
such
plaints
the
same
suffering
must
be
encountered
in
regard
to
tregear
and
his
daughter
in
every
way
he
had
been
thwarted
in
every
direction
he
was
driven
to
yield
and
yet
now
he
had
to
undergo
rebuke
from
his
own
son
because
one
of
those
inward
plaints
would
force
itself
from
his
lips
of
course
this
girl
was
to
be
taken
in
among
the
pallisers
and
treated
with
an
idolatrous
love
as
perfect
as
though
all
the
blood
of
all
the
howards
were
running
in
her
veins
what
further
inch
of
ground
was
there
for
a
fight
and
if
the
fight
were
over
why
should
he
rob
his
boy
of
one
sparkle
from
off
the
joy
of
his
triumph
silverbridge
was
now
standing
before
him
abashed
by
that
plaint
inwardly
sustained
no
doubt
by
the
conviction
of
his
great
success
but
subdued
by
his
father
wailing
however
perhaps
we
had
better
let
that
pass
said
the
duke
with
a
long
sigh
then
silverbridge
took
his
hand
and
looked
up
in
his
face
i
most
sincerely
hope
that
she
may
make
you
a
good
and
loving
wife
said
the
duke
and
that
she
may
do
her
duty
by
you
in
that
not
easy
sphere
of
life
to
which
she
will
be
called
i
am
quite
sure
she
will
said
silverbridge
whose
ideas
as
to
isabel
duties
were
confined
at
present
to
a
feeling
that
she
would
now
have
to
give
him
kisses
without
stint
what
i
have
seen
of
her
personally
recommends
her
to
me
said
the
duke
some
girls
are
fools
that
quite
true
sir
who
think
that
the
world
is
to
be
nothing
but
dancing
and
going
to
parties
many
have
been
doing
it
for
so
many
years
said
silverbridge
that
they
ca
understand
that
there
should
be
an
end
of
it
a
wife
ought
to
feel
the
great
responsibility
of
her
position
i
hope
she
will
and
the
sooner
she
begins
the
better
said
silverbridge
stoutly
and
now
said
the
duke
looking
at
his
watch
we
might
as
well
have
lunch
and
go
down
to
the
house
i
will
walk
with
you
if
you
please
it
will
be
about
time
for
each
of
us
then
the
son
was
forced
to
go
down
and
witness
the
somewhat
faded
ceremony
of
seeing
parliament
opened
by
three
lords
sitting
in
commission
before
the
throne
whereas
but
for
such
stress
as
his
father
had
laid
upon
him
he
would
have
disregarded
his
parliamentary
duties
and
have
rushed
at
once
up
to
brook
street
as
it
was
he
was
so
handed
over
from
one
political
pundit
to
another
was
so
buttonholed
by
sir
timothy
so
chaffed
as
to
the
address
by
phineas
finn
and
at
last
so
occupied
with
the
whole
matter
that
he
was
compelled
to
sit
in
his
place
till
he
had
heard
nidderdale
make
his
speech
this
the
young
scotch
lord
did
so
well
and
received
so
much
praise
for
the
doing
of
it
and
looked
so
well
in
his
uniform
that
silverbridge
almost
regretted
the
opportunity
he
had
lost
at
seven
the
sitting
was
over
the
speeches
though
full
of
interest
having
been
shorter
than
usual
they
had
been
full
of
interest
but
nobody
understood
in
the
least
what
was
going
to
happen
i
do
know
anything
about
the
prime
minister
said
lupton
as
he
left
the
house
with
our
hero
and
another
not
very
staunch
supporter
of
the
government
but
i
back
sir
timothy
to
be
the
leader
of
the
house
on
the
last
day
of
the
session
against
all
comers
i
do
think
it
much
matters
who
is
prime
minister
nowadays
at
seven
silverbridge
was
at
the
door
in
brook
street
yes
miss
boncassen
was
at
home
the
servant
thought
that
she
was
upstairs
dressing
then
silverbridge
made
his
way
without
further
invitation
into
the
there
he
remained
alone
for
ten
minutes
at
last
the
door
opened
and
boncassen
entered
dear
lord
silverbridge
who
ever
dreamed
of
seeing
you
i
thought
all
you
parliament
gentlemen
were
going
through
your
ceremonies
isabel
had
a
ticket
and
went
down
and
saw
your
father
where
is
isabel
she
gone
gone
where
on
earth
has
she
gone
to
asked
silverbridge
as
though
fearing
lest
she
had
been
carried
off
to
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
then
boncassen
explained
within
the
last
three
minutes
montacute
jones
had
called
and
carried
isabel
off
to
the
play
jones
was
up
in
town
for
a
week
and
this
had
been
a
very
old
engagement
i
hope
you
did
not
want
her
very
particularly
said
boncassen
but
i
did
most
particularly
said
lord
silverbridge
the
door
was
opened
and
boncassen
entered
the
room
i
beg
your
pardon
for
coming
at
such
a
time
said
the
lover
but
i
did
so
want
to
see
isabel
i
rather
think
she
wants
to
see
you
said
the
father
i
shall
go
to
the
theatre
after
her
that
might
be
awkward
particularly
as
i
doubt
whether
anybody
knows
what
theatre
they
are
gone
to
can
i
receive
a
message
for
her
my
lord
this
was
certainly
not
what
lord
silverbridge
had
intended
you
know
perhaps
that
i
have
seen
the
duke
oh
yes
and
i
have
seen
him
everything
is
settled
that
is
the
only
message
she
will
want
to
hear
when
she
comes
home
she
is
a
happy
girl
and
i
am
proud
to
think
that
i
should
live
to
call
such
a
grand
young
briton
as
you
my
then
the
american
took
the
young
man
two
hands
and
shook
them
cordially
while
boncassen
bursting
into
tears
insisted
on
kissing
him
indeed
she
is
a
happy
girl
said
she
but
i
hope
isabel
wo
be
carried
away
too
high
and
mighty
chapter
lxxii
carlton
terrace
three
days
after
this
it
was
arranged
that
isabel
should
be
taken
to
carlton
terrace
to
be
accepted
there
into
the
full
good
graces
of
her
future
and
to
go
through
the
pleasant
ceremony
of
seeing
the
house
in
which
it
was
to
be
her
destiny
to
live
as
mistress
what
can
be
more
interesting
to
a
girl
than
this
first
visit
to
her
future
home
and
now
isabel
boncassen
was
to
make
her
first
visit
to
the
house
in
carlton
terrace
which
the
duke
had
already
declared
his
purpose
of
surrendering
to
the
young
couple
she
was
going
among
very
grand
things
so
grand
that
those
whose
affairs
in
life
are
less
magnificent
may
think
that
her
mind
should
have
soared
altogether
above
chairs
and
tables
and
reposed
itself
among
diamonds
gold
and
silver
ornaments
rich
necklaces
the
old
masters
and
alabaster
statuary
but
dukes
and
duchesses
must
sit
upon
chairs
or
at
any
rate
on
sofas
as
well
as
their
poorer
brethren
and
probably
have
the
same
regard
for
their
comfort
isabel
was
not
above
her
future
furniture
or
the
rooms
that
were
to
be
her
rooms
or
the
stairs
which
she
would
have
to
tread
or
the
pillow
on
which
her
head
must
rest
she
had
never
yet
seen
even
the
outside
of
the
house
in
which
she
was
to
live
and
was
now
prepared
to
make
her
visit
with
as
much
enthusiasm
as
though
her
future
abode
was
to
be
prepared
for
her
in
a
small
house
in
a
small
street
beyond
islington
but
the
duke
was
no
doubt
more
than
the
house
the
more
than
the
tables
isabel
in
the
ordinary
way
of
society
he
had
already
known
almost
with
intimacy
she
the
while
had
been
well
aware
that
if
all
things
could
possibly
be
made
to
run
smoothly
with
her
this
lordly
host
who
was
so
pleasantly
courteous
to
her
would
become
her
but
she
had
known
also
that
he
in
his
courtesy
had
been
altogether
unaware
of
any
such
intention
on
her
part
and
that
she
would
now
present
herself
to
him
in
an
aspect
very
different
from
that
in
which
she
had
hitherto
been
regarded
she
was
well
aware
that
the
duke
had
not
wished
to
take
her
into
his
family
would
not
himself
have
chosen
her
for
his
son
wife
she
had
seen
enough
to
make
her
sure
that
he
had
even
chosen
another
bride
for
his
heir
she
had
been
too
clever
not
to
perceive
that
lady
mabel
grex
had
been
not
only
selected
but
almost
accepted
as
though
the
thing
had
been
certain
she
had
learned
nearly
the
whole
truth
from
silverbridge
who
was
not
good
at
keeping
a
secret
from
one
to
whom
his
heart
was
open
that
story
had
been
all
but
read
by
her
with
exactness
i
can
not
lose
you
now
she
had
said
to
him
leaning
on
his
arm
i
can
not
afford
to
lose
you
now
but
i
fear
that
someone
else
is
losing
you
to
this
he
answered
nothing
but
simply
pressed
her
closer
to
his
side
someone
else
she
continued
who
perhaps
may
have
reason
to
think
that
you
have
injured
her
no
he
said
boldly
no
there
is
no
such
person
for
he
had
never
ceased
to
assure
himself
that
in
all
that
matter
with
mabel
grex
he
had
been
guilty
of
no
treachery
there
had
been
a
moment
indeed
in
which
she
might
have
taken
him
but
she
had
chosen
to
let
it
pass
from
her
all
of
which
or
nearly
all
of
which
isabel
now
saw
and
had
seen
also
that
the
duke
had
been
a
consenting
party
to
that
other
arrangement
she
had
reason
therefore
to
doubt
the
manner
of
her
acceptance
but
she
had
been
accepted
she
had
made
such
acceptance
by
him
a
stipulation
in
her
acceptance
of
his
son
she
was
sure
of
the
ground
on
which
she
trod
and
was
determined
to
carry
herself
if
not
with
pride
yet
with
dignity
there
might
be
difficulties
before
her
but
it
should
not
be
her
fault
if
she
were
not
as
good
a
countess
and
when
time
would
have
it
so
as
good
a
duchess
as
another
the
visit
was
made
not
quite
in
the
fashion
in
which
silverbridge
himself
had
wished
his
idea
had
been
to
call
for
isabel
in
his
cab
and
take
her
down
to
carlton
terrace
mother
must
go
with
me
she
had
said
then
he
looked
blank
as
he
could
look
when
he
was
disappointed
as
he
had
looked
when
she
would
not
talk
to
him
at
the
lunch
when
she
told
him
that
it
was
not
her
business
to
entertain
him
do
be
selfish
she
added
laughing
do
you
think
that
mother
will
not
want
to
have
seen
the
house
that
i
am
to
live
in
she
shall
come
afterwards
as
often
as
she
likes
what
paying
me
morning
visits
from
new
york
she
must
come
now
if
you
please
love
me
love
my
mother
i
am
awfully
fond
of
her
said
silverbridge
who
felt
that
he
really
had
behaved
well
to
the
old
lady
so
am
i
and
therefore
she
shall
go
and
see
the
house
now
you
are
as
good
as
gold
and
do
everything
just
as
i
tell
you
but
a
good
time
is
coming
when
i
shall
have
to
do
everything
that
you
tell
me
then
it
was
arranged
that
and
miss
boncassen
were
to
be
taken
down
to
the
house
in
their
own
carriage
and
were
to
be
received
at
the
door
by
lord
silverbridge
another
arrangement
had
also
been
made
isabel
was
to
be
taken
to
the
duke
immediately
upon
her
arrival
and
to
be
left
for
awhile
with
him
alone
so
that
he
might
express
himself
as
he
might
find
fit
to
do
to
this
child
it
was
a
matter
to
him
of
such
importance
that
nothing
remaining
to
him
in
his
life
could
equal
it
it
was
not
simply
that
she
was
to
be
the
wife
of
his
son
though
that
in
itself
was
a
consideration
very
sacred
had
it
been
gerald
who
was
bringing
to
him
a
bride
the
occasion
would
have
had
less
of
awe
but
this
girl
this
american
girl
was
to
be
the
mother
and
grandmother
of
future
dukes
of
omnium
the
ancestress
it
was
to
be
hoped
of
all
future
dukes
of
omnium
by
what
she
might
be
by
what
she
might
have
in
her
of
mental
fibre
of
high
or
low
quality
of
true
or
untrue
womanliness
were
to
be
fashioned
those
who
in
days
to
come
might
be
amongst
the
strongest
and
most
faithful
bulwarks
of
the
constitution
an
england
without
a
duke
of
omnium
or
at
any
rate
without
any
duke
what
would
it
be
and
yet
he
knew
that
with
bad
dukes
his
country
would
be
in
worse
stress
than
though
she
had
none
at
all
an
aristocracy
yes
but
an
aristocracy
that
shall
be
of
the
very
best
he
believed
himself
thoroughly
in
his
order
but
if
his
order
or
many
of
his
order
should
become
as
was
now
lord
grex
then
he
thought
that
his
order
not
only
must
go
to
the
wall
but
that
in
the
cause
of
humanity
it
had
better
do
so
with
all
this
daily
hourly
always
in
his
mind
this
matter
of
the
choice
of
a
wife
for
his
heir
was
to
him
of
solemn
importance
when
they
arrived
silverbridge
was
there
and
led
them
first
of
all
into
the
my
said
boncassen
as
she
looked
around
her
i
thought
that
our
fifth
avenue
parlours
whipped
everything
in
the
way
of
city
houses
what
a
nice
little
room
for
darby
and
joan
to
sit
down
to
eat
a
in
said
isabel
it
a
beastly
great
barrack
said
silverbridge
but
the
best
of
it
is
that
we
never
use
it
we
have
a
cosy
little
place
for
darby
and
joan
you
see
now
come
to
the
governor
i
got
to
leave
you
with
him
oh
me
i
am
in
such
a
fright
he
ca
eat
you
said
boncassen
and
he
wo
even
bite
said
silverbridge
i
should
not
mind
that
because
i
could
bite
again
but
if
he
looks
as
though
he
thought
i
should
do
i
shall
drop
my
belief
is
that
he
almost
as
much
in
love
with
you
as
i
am
said
silverbridge
as
he
took
her
to
the
door
of
the
duke
room
here
we
are
sir
my
dear
said
the
duke
rising
up
and
coming
to
her
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
it
is
good
of
you
to
come
to
me
then
he
took
her
in
both
his
hands
and
kissed
her
forehead
and
her
lips
she
as
she
put
her
face
up
to
him
stood
quite
still
in
his
embrace
but
her
eyes
were
bright
with
pleasure
shall
i
leave
her
said
silverbridge
for
a
few
minutes
do
keep
her
too
long
for
i
want
to
take
her
all
over
the
house
a
few
minutes
and
then
i
will
bring
her
up
to
the
upon
this
the
door
was
closed
and
isabel
was
alone
with
her
new
father
and
so
my
dear
you
are
to
be
my
child
if
you
will
have
me
come
here
and
sit
down
by
me
your
father
has
already
told
you
that
has
he
not
he
has
told
me
that
you
had
consented
and
silverbridge
has
said
as
much
i
would
sooner
hear
it
from
you
than
from
either
of
them
then
hear
it
from
me
you
shall
be
my
child
and
if
you
will
love
me
you
shall
be
very
dear
to
me
you
shall
be
my
own
child
as
dear
as
my
own
i
must
either
love
his
wife
very
dearly
or
else
i
must
be
an
unhappy
man
and
she
must
love
me
dearly
or
i
must
be
unhappy
i
will
love
you
she
said
pressing
his
hand
and
now
let
me
say
some
few
words
to
you
only
let
there
be
no
bitterness
in
them
to
your
young
heart
when
i
say
that
i
take
you
to
my
heart
you
may
be
sure
that
i
do
so
thoroughly
you
shall
be
as
dear
to
me
and
as
near
as
though
you
had
been
all
english
shall
i
there
shall
no
difference
be
made
my
boy
wife
shall
be
my
daughter
in
very
deed
but
i
had
not
wished
it
to
be
so
i
knew
that
but
could
i
have
given
him
up
he
at
any
rate
could
not
give
you
up
there
were
little
prejudices
you
can
understand
that
oh
yes
we
who
wear
black
coats
could
not
bring
ourselves
readily
to
put
on
scarlet
garments
nor
should
we
sit
comfortably
with
our
legs
crossed
like
turks
i
am
your
scarlet
coat
and
your
turk
she
said
with
feigned
in
her
voice
but
with
a
sparkle
of
mirth
in
her
eye
but
when
i
have
once
got
into
my
scarlet
coat
i
can
be
very
proud
of
it
and
when
i
am
once
seated
in
my
divan
i
shall
find
it
of
all
postures
the
easiest
do
you
understand
me
i
think
so
not
a
shade
of
any
prejudice
shall
be
left
to
darken
my
mind
there
shall
be
no
feeling
but
that
you
are
in
truth
his
chosen
wife
after
all
neither
can
country
nor
race
nor
rank
nor
wealth
make
a
good
woman
education
can
do
much
but
nature
must
have
done
much
also
do
not
expect
too
much
of
me
i
will
so
expect
that
all
shall
be
taken
for
the
best
you
know
i
think
that
i
have
liked
you
since
i
first
saw
you
i
know
that
you
have
always
been
good
to
me
i
have
liked
you
from
the
first
that
you
are
lovely
perhaps
is
no
merit
though
to
speak
the
truth
i
am
well
pleased
that
silverbridge
should
have
found
so
much
beauty
that
is
all
a
matter
of
taste
i
suppose
she
said
laughing
but
there
is
much
that
a
young
woman
may
do
for
herself
which
i
think
you
have
done
a
silly
girl
though
she
had
been
a
second
helen
would
hardly
have
satisfied
me
or
perhaps
him
said
isabel
or
him
and
it
is
in
that
feeling
that
i
find
my
chief
satisfaction
that
he
should
have
had
the
sense
to
have
liked
such
a
one
as
you
better
than
others
now
i
have
said
it
as
not
being
one
of
us
i
did
at
first
object
to
his
choice
as
being
what
you
are
yourself
i
am
altogether
reconciled
to
it
do
not
keep
him
long
waiting
i
do
not
think
he
likes
to
be
kept
waiting
for
anything
i
dare
say
not
i
dare
say
not
and
now
there
is
one
thing
else
then
the
duke
unlocked
a
little
drawer
that
was
close
to
his
hand
and
taking
out
a
ring
put
it
on
her
finger
it
was
a
bar
of
diamonds
perhaps
a
dozen
of
them
fixed
in
a
little
circlet
of
gold
this
must
never
leave
you
he
said
it
never
shall
having
come
from
you
it
was
the
first
present
that
i
gave
to
my
wife
and
it
is
the
first
that
i
give
to
you
you
may
imagine
how
sacred
it
is
to
me
on
no
other
hand
could
it
be
worn
without
something
which
to
me
would
be
akin
to
sacrilege
now
i
must
not
keep
you
longer
or
silverbridge
will
be
storming
about
the
house
he
of
course
will
tell
me
when
it
is
to
be
but
do
not
you
keep
him
long
waiting
then
he
kissed
her
and
led
her
up
into
the
when
he
had
spoken
a
word
of
greeting
to
boncassen
he
left
them
to
their
own
devices
after
that
they
spent
the
best
part
of
an
hour
in
going
over
the
house
but
even
that
was
done
in
a
manner
unsatisfactory
to
silverbridge
wherever
isabel
went
there
boncassen
went
also
there
might
have
been
some
fun
in
showing
even
the
back
kitchens
to
his
by
herself
but
there
was
none
in
wandering
about
those
vast
underground
regions
with
a
stout
lady
who
was
really
interested
with
the
cooking
apparatus
and
the
the
bedrooms
one
after
another
became
tedious
to
him
when
boncassen
would
make
communications
respecting
each
of
them
to
her
daughter
that
is
gerald
room
said
silverbridge
you
have
never
seen
gerald
he
is
such
a
brick
boncassen
was
charmed
with
the
whips
and
sticks
and
in
gerald
room
and
expressed
an
opinion
that
young
men
in
the
states
mostly
carried
their
about
with
them
to
the
universities
when
she
was
told
that
he
had
another
collection
of
at
matching
and
another
at
oxford
she
thought
that
he
was
a
very
extravagant
young
man
isabel
who
had
heard
all
about
the
gambling
in
scotland
looked
round
at
her
lover
and
smiled
well
my
dear
said
boncassen
as
they
took
their
leave
it
is
a
very
grand
house
and
i
hope
with
all
my
heart
you
may
have
your
health
there
and
be
happy
but
i
do
know
that
you
be
any
happier
because
it
so
big
wait
till
you
see
gatherum
said
silverbridge
that
i
own
does
make
me
unhappy
it
has
been
calculated
that
three
months
at
gatherum
castle
would
drive
a
philosopher
mad
in
all
this
there
had
been
a
certain
amount
of
disappointment
for
silverbridge
but
on
that
evening
before
dinner
in
brook
street
he
received
compensation
as
the
day
was
one
somewhat
peculiar
in
its
nature
he
decided
that
it
should
be
kept
altogether
as
a
holiday
and
he
did
not
therefore
go
down
to
the
house
and
not
going
to
the
house
of
course
he
spent
the
time
with
the
boncassens
you
know
you
ought
to
go
isabel
said
to
him
when
they
found
themselves
alone
together
in
the
back
of
course
i
ought
then
go
do
you
think
i
would
keep
a
briton
from
his
duties
not
though
the
constitution
should
fall
in
ruins
do
you
suppose
that
a
man
wants
no
rest
after
inspecting
all
the
pots
and
pans
in
that
establishment
a
woman
i
believe
could
go
on
doing
that
kind
of
thing
all
day
long
you
should
remember
at
least
that
the
woman
was
interesting
herself
about
your
pots
and
pans
and
now
bella
tell
me
what
the
governor
said
to
you
then
she
showed
him
the
ring
did
he
give
you
that
she
nodded
her
head
in
assent
i
did
not
think
he
would
ever
have
parted
with
that
it
was
your
mother
she
wore
it
always
i
almost
think
that
i
never
saw
her
hand
without
it
he
would
not
have
given
you
that
unless
he
had
meant
to
be
very
good
to
you
he
was
very
good
to
me
silverbridge
i
have
a
great
deal
to
do
to
learn
to
be
your
wife
i
teach
you
yes
you
teach
me
but
will
you
teach
me
right
there
is
something
almost
awful
in
your
father
serious
dignity
and
solemn
appreciation
of
the
responsibilities
of
his
position
will
you
ever
come
to
that
i
shall
never
be
a
great
man
as
he
is
it
seems
to
me
that
life
to
him
is
a
load
which
he
does
not
object
to
carry
but
which
he
knows
must
be
carried
with
a
great
struggle
i
suppose
it
ought
to
be
so
with
everyone
yes
she
said
but
the
higher
you
put
your
foot
on
the
ladder
the
more
constant
should
be
your
thought
that
your
stepping
requires
care
i
fear
that
i
am
climbing
too
high
you
ca
come
down
now
my
young
woman
i
have
to
go
on
now
and
do
it
as
best
i
can
i
will
try
to
do
my
best
i
will
try
to
do
my
best
i
told
him
so
and
now
i
tell
you
so
i
will
try
to
do
my
best
perhaps
after
all
i
am
only
a
poppet
she
said
half
an
hour
afterwards
for
silverbridge
had
told
her
of
that
terrible
mistake
made
by
poor
dolly
longstaff
brute
he
exclaimed
not
at
all
and
when
we
are
settled
down
in
the
real
way
i
shall
hope
to
see
longstaff
very
often
i
daresay
he
call
me
a
pert
poppet
and
i
shall
not
remind
him
of
the
word
but
i
shall
always
think
of
it
and
remembering
the
way
in
which
my
character
struck
an
educated
englishman
who
was
not
altogether
towards
me
i
may
hope
to
improve
myself
chapter
lxxiii
i
have
never
loved
you
silverbridge
had
now
been
in
town
three
or
four
weeks
and
lady
mabel
grex
had
also
been
in
london
all
that
time
and
yet
he
had
not
seen
her
she
had
told
him
that
she
loved
him
and
had
asked
him
plainly
to
make
her
his
wife
he
had
told
her
that
he
could
not
do
so
that
he
was
altogether
resolved
to
make
another
woman
his
wife
then
she
had
rebuked
him
and
had
demanded
from
him
how
he
had
dared
to
treat
her
as
he
had
done
his
conscience
was
clear
he
had
his
own
code
of
morals
as
to
such
matters
and
had
as
he
regarded
it
kept
within
the
law
but
she
thought
that
she
was
badly
treated
and
had
declared
that
she
was
now
left
out
in
the
cold
for
ever
through
his
treachery
then
her
last
word
had
been
almost
the
worst
of
all
who
can
tell
what
may
come
to
pass
showing
too
plainly
that
she
would
not
even
now
give
up
her
hope
before
the
month
was
up
she
wrote
to
him
as
follows
dear
lord
silverbridge
why
do
you
not
come
and
see
me
are
friends
so
plentiful
with
you
that
one
so
staunch
as
i
may
be
thrown
over
but
of
course
i
know
why
you
do
not
come
put
all
that
aside
and
come
i
can
not
hurt
you
i
have
learned
to
feel
that
certain
things
which
the
world
regards
as
too
awful
to
be
talked
of
except
in
the
way
of
scandal
may
be
discussed
and
then
laid
aside
just
like
other
subjects
what
though
i
wear
a
wig
or
a
wooden
leg
i
may
still
be
fairly
comfortable
among
my
companions
unless
i
crucify
myself
by
trying
to
hide
my
misfortune
it
is
not
the
presence
of
the
skeleton
that
crushes
us
not
even
that
will
hurt
us
much
if
we
let
him
go
about
the
house
as
he
lists
it
is
the
everlasting
effort
which
the
horror
makes
to
peep
out
of
his
cupboard
that
robs
us
of
our
ease
at
any
rate
come
and
see
me
of
course
i
know
that
you
are
to
be
married
to
miss
boncassen
who
does
not
know
it
the
trumpeters
have
been
at
work
for
the
last
week
your
very
sincere
friend
mabel
he
wished
that
she
had
not
written
of
course
he
must
go
to
her
and
though
there
was
a
word
or
two
in
her
letter
which
angered
him
his
feelings
towards
her
were
kindly
had
not
that
american
angel
flown
across
the
atlantic
to
his
arms
he
could
have
been
well
content
to
make
her
his
wife
but
the
interview
at
the
present
moment
could
hardly
be
other
than
painful
she
could
she
said
talk
of
her
own
misfortunes
but
the
subject
would
be
very
painful
to
him
it
was
not
to
him
a
skeleton
to
be
locked
out
of
sight
but
it
had
been
a
misfortune
and
the
sooner
that
such
misfortunes
could
be
forgotten
the
better
he
knew
what
she
meant
about
trumpeters
she
had
intended
to
signify
that
isabel
in
her
pride
had
boasted
of
her
matrimonial
prospects
of
course
there
had
been
trumpets
are
there
not
always
trumpets
when
a
marriage
is
contemplated
magnificent
enough
to
be
called
an
alliance
as
for
that
he
himself
had
blown
the
trumpets
he
had
told
everybody
that
he
was
going
to
be
married
to
miss
boncassen
isabel
had
blown
no
trumpets
in
her
own
straightforward
way
she
had
told
the
truth
to
whom
it
concerned
of
course
he
would
go
and
see
lady
mabel
but
he
trusted
that
for
her
own
sake
nothing
would
be
said
about
trumpets
so
you
have
come
at
last
mabel
said
when
he
entered
the
room
no
miss
cassewary
is
not
here
as
i
wanted
to
see
you
alone
i
got
her
to
go
out
this
morning
why
did
you
not
come
before
you
said
in
your
letter
that
you
knew
why
but
in
saying
so
i
was
accusing
you
of
cowardice
was
i
not
it
was
not
cowardice
why
then
did
you
not
come
i
thought
you
would
hardly
wish
to
see
me
so
soon
after
what
passed
that
is
honest
at
any
rate
you
felt
that
i
must
be
too
much
ashamed
of
what
i
said
to
be
able
to
look
you
in
the
face
not
that
exactly
any
other
man
would
have
felt
the
same
but
no
other
man
would
be
honest
enough
to
tell
me
so
i
do
not
think
that
ever
in
your
life
you
have
constrained
yourself
to
the
civility
of
a
lie
i
hope
not
to
be
civil
and
false
is
often
better
than
to
be
harsh
and
true
i
may
be
soothed
by
the
courtesy
and
yet
not
deceived
by
the
lie
but
what
i
told
you
in
my
letter
which
i
hope
you
have
destroyed
i
will
destroy
it
do
it
was
not
intended
for
the
partner
of
your
future
joys
as
i
told
you
then
i
can
talk
freely
why
not
we
know
it
both
of
us
how
your
conscience
may
be
i
can
not
tell
but
mine
is
clear
from
that
soil
with
which
you
think
it
should
be
smirched
i
think
nothing
of
the
sort
yes
silverbridge
you
do
you
have
said
to
yourself
this
that
girl
has
determined
to
get
me
and
she
has
not
scrupled
as
to
how
she
would
do
it
no
such
idea
has
ever
crossed
my
mind
but
you
have
never
told
yourself
of
the
encouragement
which
you
gave
me
such
condemnation
as
i
have
spoken
of
would
have
been
just
if
my
efforts
had
been
sanctioned
by
no
words
no
looks
no
deeds
from
you
did
you
give
me
warrant
for
thinking
that
you
were
my
lover
that
theory
by
which
he
had
justified
himself
to
himself
seemed
to
fall
away
from
him
under
her
questioning
he
could
not
now
remember
his
words
to
her
in
those
old
days
before
miss
boncassen
had
crossed
his
path
but
he
did
know
that
he
had
once
intended
to
make
her
understand
that
he
loved
her
she
had
not
understood
him
or
understanding
had
not
accepted
his
words
and
therefore
he
had
thought
himself
free
but
it
now
seemed
that
he
had
not
been
entitled
so
to
regard
himself
there
she
sat
looking
at
him
waiting
for
his
answer
and
he
who
had
been
so
sure
that
he
had
committed
no
sin
against
her
had
not
a
word
to
say
to
her
i
want
your
answer
to
that
lord
silverbridge
i
have
told
you
that
i
would
have
no
skeleton
in
the
cupboard
down
at
matching
and
before
that
at
killancodlem
i
appealed
to
you
asking
you
to
take
me
as
your
wife
hardly
that
altogether
that
i
will
have
nothing
denied
that
i
have
done
nor
will
i
be
ashamed
of
anything
i
did
do
so
even
after
this
infatuation
i
thought
then
that
one
so
volatile
might
perhaps
fly
back
again
i
shall
not
do
that
said
he
frowning
at
her
you
need
trouble
yourself
with
no
assurance
my
friend
let
us
understand
each
other
now
i
am
not
now
supposing
that
you
can
fly
back
again
you
have
found
your
perch
and
you
must
settle
on
it
like
a
good
domestic
fowl
again
he
scowled
if
she
were
too
hard
upon
him
he
would
certainly
turn
upon
her
no
you
will
not
fly
back
again
now
but
was
i
or
was
i
not
justified
when
you
came
to
killancodlem
in
thinking
that
my
lover
had
come
there
how
can
i
tell
it
is
my
own
justification
i
am
thinking
of
i
see
all
that
but
we
can
not
both
be
justified
did
you
mean
me
to
suppose
that
you
were
speaking
to
me
words
in
earnest
when
there
sitting
in
that
very
spot
you
spoke
to
me
of
your
love
did
i
speak
of
my
love
did
you
speak
of
your
love
and
now
silverbridge
for
if
there
be
an
english
gentleman
on
earth
i
think
that
you
are
one
as
a
gentleman
tell
me
this
did
you
not
even
tell
your
father
that
i
should
be
your
wife
i
know
you
did
did
he
tell
you
men
such
as
you
and
he
who
can
not
even
lie
with
your
eyelids
who
will
not
condescend
to
cover
up
a
secret
by
a
moment
of
feigned
inanimation
have
many
voices
he
did
tell
me
but
he
broke
no
confidence
he
told
me
but
did
not
mean
to
tell
me
now
you
also
have
told
me
i
did
i
told
him
so
and
then
i
changed
my
mind
i
know
you
changed
your
mind
men
often
do
a
pinker
pink
a
whiter
white
a
finger
that
will
press
you
just
half
an
ounce
the
closer
a
cheek
that
will
consent
to
let
itself
come
just
a
little
nearer
no
no
no
it
was
because
isabel
had
not
easily
consented
to
such
approaches
trifles
such
as
these
will
do
it
and
some
such
trifles
have
done
it
with
you
it
would
be
beneath
me
to
make
comparisons
where
i
might
seem
to
be
the
gainer
i
grant
her
beauty
she
is
very
lovely
she
has
succeeded
i
have
succeeded
but
i
am
justified
and
you
are
condemned
is
it
not
so
tell
me
like
a
man
you
are
justified
and
you
are
condemned
when
you
told
me
that
i
should
be
your
wife
and
then
told
your
father
the
same
story
was
i
to
think
it
all
meant
nothing
have
you
deceived
me
i
did
not
mean
it
have
you
deceived
me
what
you
can
not
deny
it
and
yet
have
not
the
manliness
to
own
it
to
a
poor
woman
who
can
only
save
herself
from
humiliation
by
extorting
the
truth
from
you
oh
mabel
i
am
so
sorry
it
should
be
so
i
believe
you
are
with
a
sorrow
that
will
last
till
she
is
again
sitting
close
to
you
nor
silverbridge
do
i
wish
it
to
be
longer
no
no
no
your
fault
after
all
has
not
been
great
you
deceived
but
did
not
mean
to
deceive
me
never
never
and
i
fancy
you
have
never
known
how
much
you
bore
about
with
you
your
modesty
has
been
so
perfect
that
you
have
not
thought
of
yourself
as
more
than
other
men
you
have
forgotten
that
you
have
had
in
your
hand
the
disposal
to
some
one
woman
of
a
throne
in
paradise
i
do
suppose
you
thought
of
that
but
i
did
why
should
i
tell
falsehoods
now
i
have
determined
that
you
should
know
everything
but
i
could
better
confess
to
you
my
own
sins
when
i
had
shown
that
you
too
have
not
been
innocent
not
think
of
it
do
not
men
think
of
high
titles
and
great
wealth
and
power
and
place
and
if
men
why
should
not
women
do
not
men
try
to
get
them
and
are
they
not
even
applauded
for
their
energy
a
woman
has
but
one
way
to
try
i
tried
i
do
not
think
it
was
all
for
that
how
shall
i
answer
that
without
a
confession
which
even
i
am
not
hardened
enough
to
make
in
truth
silverbridge
i
have
never
loved
you
he
drew
himself
up
slowly
before
he
answered
her
and
gradually
assumed
a
look
very
different
from
that
easy
boyish
smile
which
was
customary
to
him
i
am
glad
of
that
he
said
why
are
you
glad
now
i
can
have
no
regrets
you
need
have
none
it
was
necessary
to
me
that
i
should
have
my
little
triumph
that
i
should
show
you
that
i
knew
how
far
you
had
wronged
me
but
now
i
wish
that
you
should
know
everything
i
have
never
loved
you
there
is
an
end
of
it
then
but
i
have
liked
you
so
well
so
much
better
than
all
others
a
dozen
men
have
asked
me
to
marry
them
and
though
they
might
be
nothing
till
they
made
that
request
then
they
became
things
of
horror
to
me
but
you
were
not
a
thing
of
horror
i
could
have
become
your
wife
and
i
think
that
i
could
have
learned
to
love
you
it
is
best
as
it
is
i
ought
to
say
so
too
but
i
have
a
doubt
i
should
have
liked
to
be
duchess
of
omnium
and
perhaps
i
might
have
fitted
the
place
better
than
one
who
can
as
yet
know
but
little
of
its
duties
or
its
privileges
i
may
perhaps
think
that
that
other
arrangement
would
have
been
better
even
for
you
i
can
take
care
of
myself
in
that
i
should
have
married
you
without
loving
you
but
i
should
have
done
so
determined
to
serve
you
with
a
devotion
which
a
woman
who
does
love
hardly
thinks
necessary
i
would
have
so
done
my
duty
that
you
should
never
have
guessed
that
my
heart
had
been
in
the
keeping
of
another
man
another
man
yes
of
course
if
there
had
been
no
other
man
why
not
you
am
i
so
hard
do
you
think
that
i
can
love
no
one
are
you
not
such
a
one
that
a
girl
would
naturally
love
were
she
not
preoccupied
that
a
woman
should
love
seems
as
necessary
as
that
a
man
should
not
a
man
can
love
too
no
hardly
he
can
admire
and
he
can
like
and
he
can
fondle
and
be
fond
he
can
admire
and
approve
and
perhaps
worship
he
can
know
of
a
woman
that
she
is
part
of
himself
the
most
sacred
part
and
therefore
will
protect
her
from
the
very
winds
but
all
that
will
not
make
love
it
does
not
come
to
a
man
that
to
be
separated
from
a
woman
is
to
be
dislocated
from
his
very
self
a
man
has
but
one
centre
and
that
is
himself
a
woman
has
two
though
the
second
may
never
be
seen
by
her
may
live
in
the
arms
of
another
may
do
all
for
that
other
that
man
can
do
for
woman
still
still
though
he
be
half
the
globe
asunder
from
her
still
he
is
to
her
the
half
of
her
existence
if
she
really
love
there
is
i
fancy
no
end
of
it
to
the
end
of
time
i
shall
love
frank
tregear
tregear
who
else
he
is
engaged
to
mary
of
course
he
is
why
not
to
her
or
whomsoever
else
he
might
like
best
he
is
as
true
i
doubt
not
to
your
sister
as
you
are
to
your
american
beauty
or
as
you
would
have
been
to
me
had
fancy
held
he
used
to
love
me
you
were
always
friends
always
dear
friends
and
he
would
have
loved
me
if
a
man
were
capable
of
loving
but
he
could
sever
himself
from
me
easily
just
when
he
was
told
to
do
so
i
thought
that
i
could
do
the
same
but
i
can
not
a
jackal
is
born
a
jackal
and
not
a
lion
and
can
not
help
himself
so
is
a
woman
born
a
woman
they
are
clinging
parasite
things
which
can
not
but
adhere
though
they
destroy
themselves
by
adhering
do
not
suppose
that
i
take
a
pride
in
it
i
would
give
one
of
my
eyes
to
be
able
to
disregard
him
time
will
do
it
yes
time
that
brings
wrinkles
and
and
rheumatism
though
i
have
so
hated
those
men
as
to
be
unable
to
endure
them
still
i
want
some
man
house
and
his
name
some
man
bread
and
wine
some
man
jewels
and
titles
and
woods
and
parks
and
gardens
if
i
can
get
them
time
can
help
a
man
in
his
sorrow
if
he
begins
at
forty
to
make
speeches
or
to
win
races
or
to
breed
oxen
he
can
yet
live
a
prosperous
life
time
is
but
a
poor
consoler
for
a
young
woman
who
has
to
be
married
oh
mabel
and
now
let
there
be
not
a
word
more
about
it
i
know
that
i
can
trust
you
indeed
you
may
though
you
will
tell
her
everything
else
you
will
not
tell
her
this
no
not
this
and
surely
you
will
not
tell
your
sister
i
shall
tell
no
one
it
is
because
you
are
so
true
that
i
have
dared
to
trust
you
i
had
to
justify
myself
and
then
to
confess
had
i
at
that
one
moment
taken
you
at
your
word
you
would
never
have
known
anything
of
all
this
is
a
tide
in
the
affairs
of
men
but
i
let
the
flood
go
by
i
shall
not
see
you
again
now
before
you
are
married
but
come
to
me
afterwards
chapter
lxxiv
let
us
drink
a
glass
of
wine
together
silverbridge
pondered
it
all
much
as
he
went
home
what
a
terrible
story
was
that
he
had
heard
the
horror
to
him
was
chiefly
in
this
that
she
should
yet
be
driven
to
marry
some
man
without
even
fancying
that
she
could
love
him
and
this
was
lady
mabel
grex
who
on
his
own
first
entrance
into
london
life
now
not
much
more
than
twelve
months
ago
had
seemed
to
him
to
stand
above
all
other
girls
in
beauty
charm
and
popularity
as
he
opened
the
door
of
the
house
with
his
who
should
be
coming
out
but
frank
tregear
frank
tregear
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
but
still
with
an
unmistakable
look
of
general
satisfaction
when
on
earth
did
you
come
up
asked
silverbridge
tregear
told
him
that
he
had
arrived
on
the
previous
evening
from
harrington
and
why
the
doctor
would
not
have
let
you
come
if
he
could
have
helped
it
when
he
found
he
could
not
help
it
he
did
let
me
come
i
am
nearly
all
right
if
i
had
been
nearly
all
wrong
i
should
have
had
to
come
and
what
are
you
doing
here
well
if
you
allow
me
i
go
back
with
you
for
a
moment
what
do
you
think
i
have
been
doing
have
you
seen
my
sister
yes
i
have
seen
your
sister
and
i
have
done
better
than
that
i
have
seen
your
father
lord
silverbridge
behold
your
you
do
mean
to
say
that
it
is
arranged
i
do
what
did
he
say
he
made
me
understand
by
most
unanswerable
arguments
that
i
had
no
business
to
think
of
such
a
thing
i
did
not
fight
the
point
with
him
but
simply
stood
there
as
conclusive
evidence
of
my
business
he
told
me
that
we
should
have
nothing
to
live
on
unless
he
gave
us
an
income
i
assured
him
that
i
would
never
ask
him
for
a
shilling
i
can
not
allow
her
to
marry
a
man
without
an
income
he
said
i
know
his
way
so
well
i
had
just
two
facts
to
go
upon
that
i
would
not
give
her
up
and
that
she
would
not
give
me
up
when
i
pointed
that
out
he
tore
his
hair
in
a
mild
way
and
said
that
he
did
not
understand
that
kind
of
thing
at
all
and
yet
he
gave
way
of
course
he
did
they
say
that
when
a
king
of
old
would
consent
to
see
a
petitioner
for
his
life
he
was
bound
by
his
royalty
to
mercy
so
it
was
with
the
duke
then
very
early
in
the
argument
he
forgot
himself
and
called
her
mary
i
knew
he
had
thrown
up
the
sponge
then
how
did
he
give
way
at
last
he
asked
me
what
were
my
ideas
about
life
in
general
i
said
that
i
thought
parliament
was
a
good
sort
of
thing
that
i
was
lucky
enough
to
have
a
seat
and
that
i
should
take
lodgings
somewhere
in
westminster
till
what
he
asked
something
is
settled
i
replied
then
he
turned
away
from
me
and
remained
silent
i
see
lady
mary
i
asked
you
may
see
her
he
replied
as
he
rang
the
bell
then
when
the
servant
was
gone
he
stopped
me
love
her
too
dearly
to
see
her
grieve
he
said
hope
you
will
show
that
you
can
be
worthy
of
her
then
i
made
some
sort
of
protestation
and
went
upstairs
while
i
was
with
mary
there
came
a
message
to
me
telling
me
to
come
to
dinner
the
boncassens
are
all
dining
here
then
we
shall
be
a
family
party
so
far
i
suppose
i
may
say
it
is
settled
when
he
will
let
us
marry
heaven
only
knows
mary
declares
that
she
will
not
press
him
i
certainly
can
not
do
so
it
is
all
a
matter
of
money
he
wo
care
about
that
but
he
may
perhaps
think
that
a
little
patience
will
do
us
good
you
will
have
to
soften
him
then
silverbridge
told
all
that
he
knew
about
himself
he
was
to
be
married
in
may
was
to
go
to
matching
for
a
week
or
two
after
his
wedding
was
then
to
see
the
session
to
an
end
and
after
that
to
travel
with
his
wife
in
the
united
states
i
do
suppose
we
shall
be
allowed
to
run
about
the
world
together
so
soon
as
that
said
tregear
but
i
am
too
well
satisfied
with
my
day
work
to
complain
did
he
say
what
he
meant
to
give
her
oh
dear
no
nor
even
that
he
meant
to
give
her
anything
i
should
not
dream
of
asking
a
question
about
it
nor
when
he
makes
any
proposition
shall
i
think
of
having
any
opinion
of
my
own
he
make
it
all
right
for
her
sake
you
know
my
chief
object
as
regards
him
is
that
he
should
not
think
that
i
have
been
looking
after
her
money
well
i
suppose
we
shall
all
meet
at
dinner
when
tregear
left
him
silverbridge
went
to
his
father
room
he
was
anxious
that
they
should
understand
each
other
as
to
engagement
i
thought
you
were
at
the
house
said
the
duke
i
was
going
there
but
i
met
tregear
at
the
door
he
tells
me
you
have
accepted
him
for
mary
i
wish
that
he
had
never
seen
her
do
you
think
that
a
man
can
be
thwarted
in
everything
and
not
feel
it
i
thought
you
had
reconciled
yourself
to
isabel
if
it
were
that
alone
i
could
do
so
the
more
easily
because
personally
she
wins
upon
me
and
this
man
too
it
is
not
that
i
find
fault
with
himself
he
is
in
all
respects
a
gentleman
i
hope
so
but
yet
had
he
a
right
to
set
his
heart
there
where
he
could
make
his
fortune
having
none
of
his
own
he
did
not
think
of
that
he
should
have
thought
of
it
a
man
does
not
allow
himself
to
love
without
any
consideration
or
purpose
you
say
that
he
is
a
gentleman
a
gentleman
should
not
look
to
live
on
means
brought
to
him
by
a
wife
you
say
that
he
did
not
he
did
not
think
of
it
a
gentleman
should
do
more
than
not
think
of
it
he
should
think
that
it
shall
not
be
so
a
man
should
own
his
means
or
should
earn
them
how
many
men
sir
do
neither
yes
i
know
said
the
duke
such
a
doctrine
nowadays
is
caviare
to
the
general
one
must
live
as
others
live
around
one
i
suppose
i
could
not
see
her
suffer
it
was
too
much
for
me
when
i
became
convinced
that
this
was
no
temporary
passion
no
romantic
love
which
time
might
banish
that
she
was
of
such
a
temperament
that
she
could
not
change
then
i
had
to
give
way
gerald
i
suppose
will
bring
me
some
for
his
wife
oh
sir
you
should
not
say
that
to
me
no
i
should
not
have
said
it
to
you
i
beg
your
pardon
silverbridge
then
he
paused
a
moment
turning
over
certain
thoughts
within
his
own
bosom
perhaps
after
all
it
is
well
that
a
pride
of
which
i
am
conscious
should
be
rebuked
and
it
may
be
that
the
rebuke
has
come
in
such
a
form
that
i
should
be
thankful
i
know
that
i
can
love
isabel
that
to
me
will
be
everything
and
this
young
man
has
nothing
that
should
revolt
me
i
think
he
has
been
wrong
but
now
that
i
have
said
it
i
will
let
all
that
pass
from
me
he
will
dine
with
us
silverbridge
then
went
up
to
see
his
sister
so
you
have
settled
your
little
business
mary
oh
silverbridge
you
will
wish
me
joy
certainly
why
not
papa
is
so
stern
with
me
of
course
he
has
given
way
and
of
course
i
am
grateful
but
he
looks
at
me
as
though
i
had
done
something
to
be
forgiven
take
the
good
the
gods
provide
you
mary
that
will
all
come
right
but
i
have
not
done
anything
wrong
have
i
that
is
a
matter
of
opinion
how
can
i
answer
about
you
when
i
quite
know
whether
i
have
done
anything
wrong
or
not
myself
i
am
going
to
marry
the
girl
i
have
chosen
that
enough
for
me
but
you
did
change
we
need
not
say
anything
about
that
but
i
have
never
changed
papa
just
told
me
that
he
would
consent
and
that
i
might
write
to
him
so
i
did
write
and
he
came
but
papa
looks
at
me
as
though
i
had
broken
his
heart
i
tell
you
what
it
is
mary
you
expect
too
much
from
him
he
has
not
had
his
own
way
with
either
of
us
and
of
course
he
feels
it
as
tregear
had
said
there
was
quite
a
family
party
in
carlton
terrace
though
as
yet
the
family
was
not
bound
together
by
family
ties
all
the
boncassens
were
there
the
father
the
mother
and
the
promised
bride
boncassen
bore
himself
with
more
ease
than
any
one
in
the
company
having
at
his
command
a
gift
of
manliness
which
enabled
him
to
regard
this
marriage
exactly
as
he
would
have
done
any
other
america
was
not
so
far
distant
but
what
he
would
be
able
to
see
his
girl
occasionally
he
liked
the
young
man
and
he
believed
in
the
comfort
of
wealth
therefore
he
was
satisfied
but
when
the
marriage
was
spoken
of
or
written
of
as
an
alliance
then
he
would
say
a
hard
word
or
two
about
dukes
and
lords
in
general
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
he
was
happy
and
at
his
ease
so
much
could
not
be
said
for
his
wife
with
whom
the
duke
attempted
to
place
himself
on
terms
of
family
equality
but
in
doing
this
he
failed
to
hide
the
attempt
even
from
her
and
she
broke
down
under
it
had
he
simply
walked
into
the
room
with
her
as
he
would
have
done
on
any
other
occasion
and
then
remarked
that
the
frost
was
keen
or
the
thaw
disagreeable
it
would
have
been
better
for
her
but
when
he
told
her
that
he
hoped
she
would
often
make
herself
at
home
in
that
house
and
looked
as
he
said
it
as
though
he
were
asking
her
to
take
a
place
among
the
goddesses
of
olympus
she
was
troubled
as
to
her
answer
oh
my
lord
duke
she
said
when
i
think
of
isabel
living
here
and
being
called
by
such
a
name
it
almost
upsets
me
isabel
had
all
her
father
courage
but
she
was
more
sensitive
and
though
she
would
have
borne
her
honours
well
was
oppressed
by
the
feeling
that
the
weight
was
too
much
for
her
mother
she
could
not
keep
her
ear
from
listening
to
her
mother
words
or
her
eye
from
watching
her
mother
motions
she
was
prepared
to
carry
her
mother
everywhere
as
other
girls
have
to
be
taken
with
their
belongings
so
must
i
if
i
be
taken
at
all
this
she
had
said
plainly
enough
there
should
be
no
division
between
her
and
her
mother
but
still
knowing
that
her
mother
was
not
quite
at
ease
she
was
hardly
at
ease
herself
silverbridge
came
in
at
the
last
moment
and
of
course
occupied
a
chair
next
to
isabel
as
the
house
was
sitting
it
was
natural
that
he
should
come
up
in
a
flurry
i
left
phineas
he
said
pounding
away
in
his
old
style
at
sir
timothy
isabel
you
must
come
down
some
day
and
hear
sir
timothy
badgered
i
must
be
back
again
about
ten
well
gerald
how
are
they
all
at
lazarus
he
made
an
effort
to
be
free
and
easy
but
even
he
soon
found
that
it
was
an
effort
gerald
had
come
up
from
oxford
for
the
occasion
that
he
might
make
acquaintance
with
the
boncassens
he
had
taken
isabel
in
to
dinner
but
had
been
turned
out
of
his
place
when
his
brother
came
in
he
had
been
a
little
confused
by
the
first
impression
made
upon
him
by
boncassen
and
had
involuntarily
watched
his
father
silver
is
going
to
have
an
odd
sort
of
a
he
said
afterwards
to
mary
who
remarked
in
reply
that
this
would
not
signify
as
the
would
be
in
new
york
tregear
part
was
very
difficult
to
play
he
could
not
but
feel
that
though
he
had
succeeded
still
he
was
as
yet
looked
upon
askance
silverbridge
had
told
him
that
by
degrees
the
duke
would
be
won
round
but
that
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
he
should
swallow
at
once
all
his
regrets
the
truth
of
this
could
not
but
be
accepted
the
immediate
inconvenience
however
was
not
the
less
felt
each
and
everyone
there
knew
the
position
of
each
and
everyone
but
tregear
felt
it
difficult
to
act
up
to
his
he
could
not
play
the
lover
openly
as
did
silverbridge
mary
herself
was
disposed
to
be
very
silent
the
tedium
of
her
dull
life
had
been
removed
her
determination
had
been
rewarded
all
that
she
had
wanted
had
been
granted
to
her
and
she
was
happy
but
she
was
not
prepared
to
show
off
her
happiness
before
others
and
she
was
aware
that
she
was
thought
to
have
done
evil
by
introducing
her
lover
into
her
august
family
but
it
was
the
duke
who
made
the
greatest
efforts
and
with
the
least
success
he
had
told
himself
again
and
again
that
he
was
bound
by
every
sense
of
duty
to
swallow
all
regrets
he
had
taken
himself
to
task
on
this
matter
he
had
done
so
even
out
loud
to
his
son
he
had
declared
that
he
would
let
it
all
pass
from
him
but
who
does
not
know
how
hard
it
is
for
a
man
in
such
matters
to
keep
his
word
to
himself
who
has
not
said
to
himself
at
the
very
moment
of
his
own
delinquency
now
it
is
now
at
this
very
instant
of
time
that
i
should
crush
and
quench
and
kill
the
evil
spirit
within
me
it
is
now
that
i
should
abate
my
greed
or
smother
my
or
abandon
my
hatred
it
is
now
and
here
that
i
should
drive
out
the
fiend
as
i
have
sworn
to
myself
that
i
would
do
and
yet
has
failed
that
it
would
be
done
would
be
done
at
last
by
this
man
was
very
certain
when
silverbridge
assured
his
sister
that
it
would
come
all
right
very
soon
he
had
understood
his
father
character
but
it
could
not
be
completed
quite
at
once
had
he
been
required
to
take
isabel
only
to
his
heart
it
would
have
been
comparatively
easy
there
are
men
who
do
not
seem
at
first
sight
very
susceptible
to
feminine
attractions
who
nevertheless
are
dominated
by
the
grace
of
flounces
who
succumb
to
petticoats
unconsciously
and
who
are
half
in
love
with
every
woman
merely
for
her
womanhood
so
it
was
with
the
duke
he
had
given
way
in
regard
to
isabel
with
less
than
half
the
effort
that
frank
tregear
was
likely
to
cost
him
you
were
not
at
the
house
sir
said
silverbridge
when
he
felt
that
there
was
a
pause
no
not
then
there
was
a
pause
again
i
think
that
we
shall
beat
cambridge
this
year
to
a
moral
said
gerald
who
was
sitting
at
the
round
table
opposite
to
his
father
boncassen
who
was
next
to
him
asked
in
irony
probably
rather
than
in
ignorance
whether
the
victory
was
to
be
achieved
by
mathematical
or
classical
proficiency
gerald
turned
and
looked
at
him
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
have
never
heard
of
the
university
papa
you
have
disgraced
yourself
for
ever
said
isabel
have
i
my
dear
yes
i
have
heard
of
them
but
i
thought
lord
gerald
protestation
was
too
great
for
a
mere
aquatic
triumph
now
you
are
poking
your
fun
at
me
said
gerald
well
he
may
said
the
duke
sententiously
we
have
laid
ourselves
very
open
to
having
fun
poked
at
us
in
this
matter
i
think
sir
said
tregear
that
they
are
learning
to
do
the
same
sort
of
thing
at
the
american
universities
oh
indeed
said
the
duke
in
a
solemn
dry
funereal
tone
and
then
all
the
little
life
which
gerald
remark
about
the
had
produced
was
quenched
at
once
the
duke
was
not
angry
with
tregear
for
his
little
word
of
defence
but
he
was
not
able
to
bring
himself
into
harmony
with
this
one
guest
and
was
almost
savage
to
him
without
meaning
it
he
was
continually
asking
himself
why
destiny
had
been
so
hard
upon
him
as
to
force
him
to
receive
there
at
his
table
as
his
a
man
who
was
distasteful
to
him
and
he
was
endeavouring
to
answer
the
question
taking
himself
to
task
and
telling
himself
that
his
destiny
had
done
him
no
injury
and
that
the
pride
which
had
been
wounded
was
a
false
pride
he
was
making
a
brave
fight
but
during
the
fight
he
was
hardly
fit
to
be
the
genial
father
and
of
young
people
who
were
going
to
be
married
to
one
another
but
before
the
dinner
was
over
he
made
a
great
effort
tregear
he
said
and
even
that
was
an
effort
for
he
had
never
hitherto
mentioned
the
man
name
without
the
formal
mister
tregear
as
this
is
the
first
time
you
have
sat
at
my
table
let
me
be
and
ask
you
to
drink
a
glass
of
wine
with
me
the
glass
of
wine
was
drunk
and
the
ceremony
afforded
infinite
satisfaction
at
least
to
one
person
there
mary
could
not
keep
herself
from
some
expression
of
joy
by
pressing
her
finger
for
a
moment
against
her
lover
arm
he
though
not
usually
given
to
such
manifestations
blushed
up
to
his
eyes
but
the
feeling
produced
on
the
company
was
solemn
rather
than
jovial
everyone
there
understood
it
all
boncassen
could
read
the
duke
mind
down
to
the
last
line
even
boncassen
was
aware
that
an
act
of
reconciliation
had
been
intended
when
the
governor
drank
that
glass
of
wine
it
seemed
as
though
half
the
marriage
ceremony
had
been
performed
gerald
said
to
his
brother
that
evening
when
the
duke
glass
was
replaced
on
the
table
he
himself
was
conscious
of
the
solemnity
of
what
he
had
done
and
was
half
ashamed
of
it
when
the
ladies
had
gone
upstairs
the
conversation
became
political
and
lively
the
duke
could
talk
freely
about
the
state
of
things
to
boncassen
and
was
able
gradually
to
include
tregear
in
the
badinage
with
which
he
attacked
the
conservatism
of
his
son
and
so
the
passed
well
upstairs
the
two
girls
immediately
came
together
leaving
boncassen
to
chew
the
cud
of
the
grandeur
around
her
in
the
sleepy
comfort
of
an
and
so
everything
is
settled
for
both
of
us
said
isabel
of
course
i
knew
it
was
to
be
settled
for
you
you
told
me
so
at
custins
i
did
not
know
it
myself
then
i
only
told
you
that
he
had
asked
me
and
you
hardly
believed
me
i
certainly
believed
you
but
you
knew
about
lady
mabel
grex
i
only
suspected
something
and
now
i
know
it
was
a
mistake
it
has
never
been
more
than
a
suspicion
and
why
when
we
were
at
custins
did
you
not
tell
me
about
yourself
i
had
nothing
to
tell
i
can
understand
that
but
is
it
not
joyful
that
it
should
all
be
settled
only
poor
lady
mabel
you
have
got
no
lady
mabel
to
trouble
your
conscience
from
which
it
was
evident
that
silverbridge
had
not
told
all
chapter
lxxv
the
major
story
by
the
end
of
march
isabel
was
in
paris
whither
she
had
forbidden
her
lover
to
follow
her
silverbridge
was
therefore
reduced
to
the
shifts
of
a
bachelor
life
in
which
his
friends
seemed
to
think
that
he
ought
now
to
take
special
delight
perhaps
he
did
not
take
much
delight
in
them
he
was
no
doubt
impatient
to
commence
that
steady
married
life
for
which
he
had
prepared
himself
but
nevertheless
just
at
present
he
lived
a
good
deal
at
the
beargarden
where
was
he
to
live
the
boncassens
were
in
paris
his
sister
was
at
matching
with
a
houseful
of
other
pallisers
and
his
father
was
again
deep
in
politics
of
course
he
was
much
in
the
house
of
commons
but
that
also
was
stupid
indeed
everything
would
be
stupid
till
isabel
came
back
perhaps
dinner
was
more
comfortable
at
the
club
than
at
the
house
and
then
as
everybody
knew
it
was
a
good
thing
to
change
the
scene
therefore
he
dined
at
the
club
and
though
he
would
keep
his
hansom
and
go
down
to
the
house
again
in
the
course
of
the
evening
he
spent
many
long
hours
at
the
beargarden
there
very
soon
be
an
end
of
this
as
far
as
you
are
concerned
said
lupton
to
him
one
evening
as
they
were
sitting
in
the
after
dinner
the
sooner
the
better
as
far
as
this
place
is
concerned
this
place
is
as
good
as
any
other
for
the
matter
of
that
i
like
the
beargarden
since
we
got
rid
of
two
or
three
not
very
charming
characters
you
mean
my
poor
friend
tifto
said
silverbridge
no
i
was
not
thinking
of
tifto
there
were
one
or
two
here
who
were
quite
as
bad
as
tifto
i
wonder
what
has
become
of
that
poor
devil
i
do
know
in
the
least
you
heard
of
that
row
about
the
hounds
and
his
letter
to
you
he
wrote
to
me
and
i
answered
him
as
you
know
but
whither
he
vanished
or
what
he
is
doing
or
how
he
is
living
i
have
not
the
least
idea
gone
to
join
those
other
fellows
abroad
i
should
say
among
them
they
got
a
lot
of
money
as
the
duke
ought
to
remember
he
is
not
with
them
said
silverbridge
as
though
he
were
in
some
degree
mourning
over
the
fate
of
his
unfortunate
friend
i
suppose
captain
green
was
the
leader
in
all
that
now
it
is
all
done
and
gone
i
own
to
a
certain
regard
for
the
major
he
was
true
to
me
till
he
thought
i
snubbed
him
i
would
not
let
him
go
down
to
silverbridge
with
me
i
always
thought
that
i
drove
the
poor
major
to
his
malpractices
at
this
moment
dolly
longstaff
sauntered
into
the
room
and
came
up
to
them
it
may
be
remembered
that
dolly
had
declared
his
purpose
of
emigrating
as
soon
as
he
heard
that
the
duke
heir
had
serious
thoughts
of
marrying
the
lady
whom
he
loved
he
withdrew
at
once
from
the
contest
but
as
he
did
so
he
acknowledged
that
there
could
be
no
longer
a
home
for
him
in
the
country
which
isabel
was
to
inhabit
as
the
wife
of
another
man
gradually
however
better
thoughts
returned
to
him
after
all
what
was
she
but
a
pert
poppet
he
determined
that
marriage
clips
a
fellow
wings
confoundedly
and
so
he
set
himself
to
enjoy
life
after
his
old
fashion
there
was
perhaps
a
little
swagger
as
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
and
addressed
the
happy
lover
i
be
shot
if
i
did
meet
tifto
at
the
corner
of
the
street
tifto
yes
tifto
he
looked
awfully
seedy
with
a
greatcoat
buttoned
up
to
his
chin
a
shabby
hat
and
old
gloves
did
he
speak
to
you
asked
silverbridge
no
nor
i
to
him
he
had
time
to
think
whether
he
would
speak
or
not
and
you
may
be
sure
i
did
nothing
further
was
said
about
the
man
but
silverbridge
was
uneasy
and
silent
when
his
cigar
was
finished
he
got
up
saying
that
he
should
go
back
to
the
house
as
he
left
the
club
he
looked
about
him
as
though
expecting
to
see
his
old
friend
and
when
he
had
passed
through
the
first
street
and
had
got
into
the
haymarket
there
he
was
the
major
came
up
to
him
touched
his
hat
asked
to
be
allowed
to
say
a
few
words
i
do
think
it
can
do
any
good
said
silverbridge
the
man
had
not
attempted
to
shake
hands
with
him
or
affected
familiarity
but
seemed
to
be
thoroughly
humiliated
i
do
think
i
can
be
of
any
service
to
you
and
therefore
i
had
rather
decline
i
do
want
you
to
be
of
any
service
my
lord
then
what
the
good
i
have
something
to
say
may
i
come
to
you
then
silverbridge
allowed
himself
to
make
an
appointment
and
an
hour
was
named
at
which
tifto
might
call
in
carlton
terrace
he
felt
that
he
almost
owed
some
reparation
to
the
wretched
man
whom
he
had
unfortunately
admitted
among
his
friends
whom
he
had
used
and
to
whom
he
had
been
uncourteous
exactly
at
the
hour
named
the
major
was
shown
into
his
room
dolly
had
said
that
he
was
shabby
but
the
man
was
altered
rather
than
shabby
he
still
had
rings
on
his
fingers
and
studs
in
his
shirt
and
a
jewelled
pin
in
his
cravat
but
he
had
shaven
off
his
moustache
and
the
tuft
from
his
chin
and
his
hair
had
been
cut
short
and
in
spite
of
his
jewellery
there
was
a
look
about
him
i
got
something
that
i
particularly
want
to
say
to
you
my
lord
silverbridge
would
not
shake
hands
with
him
but
could
not
refrain
from
offering
him
a
chair
well
you
can
say
it
now
yes
but
it
is
so
very
easy
to
be
said
there
are
some
things
though
you
want
to
say
them
ever
so
you
do
quite
know
how
to
do
it
you
have
your
choice
major
tifto
you
can
speak
or
hold
your
tongue
then
there
was
a
pause
during
which
silverbridge
sat
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
trying
to
look
unconcerned
but
if
you
got
it
here
and
feel
it
as
i
do
the
poor
man
as
he
said
this
put
his
hand
upon
his
heart
you
ca
sleep
in
your
bed
till
it
out
i
did
that
thing
that
they
said
i
did
what
thing
why
the
nail
it
was
i
lamed
the
horse
i
am
sorry
for
it
i
can
say
nothing
else
you
ai
so
sorry
for
it
as
i
am
oh
no
you
can
never
be
that
my
lord
after
all
what
does
it
matter
to
you
very
little
i
meant
that
i
was
sorry
for
your
sake
i
believe
you
are
my
lord
for
though
you
could
be
rough
you
was
always
kind
now
i
will
tell
you
everything
and
then
you
can
do
as
you
please
i
wish
to
do
nothing
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
the
matter
is
over
it
made
me
sick
of
horses
and
i
do
not
wish
to
have
to
think
of
it
again
nevertheless
my
lord
i
got
to
tell
it
it
was
green
who
put
me
up
to
it
he
did
it
just
for
the
plunder
as
god
is
my
judge
it
was
not
for
the
money
i
did
it
then
it
was
revenge
it
was
the
devil
got
hold
of
me
my
lord
up
to
that
i
had
always
been
square
square
as
a
die
i
got
to
think
that
your
lordship
was
upsetting
i
do
know
whether
your
lordship
remembers
but
you
did
put
me
down
once
or
twice
rather
uncommon
i
hope
i
was
not
unjust
i
do
say
you
was
my
lord
but
i
got
a
feeling
on
me
that
you
wanted
to
get
rid
of
me
and
i
all
the
time
doing
the
best
i
could
for
the
i
did
do
the
best
i
could
up
to
that
very
morning
at
doncaster
well
it
was
green
put
me
up
to
it
i
do
say
i
was
to
get
nothing
but
it
was
so
much
more
than
i
could
have
got
by
the
winning
and
i
lost
pretty
nearly
all
that
i
did
get
do
you
remember
my
lord
and
now
the
major
sank
his
voice
to
a
whisper
when
i
come
up
to
your
bedroom
that
morning
i
remember
it
the
first
time
yes
i
remember
it
because
i
came
twice
my
lord
when
i
came
first
it
had
been
done
you
turned
me
out
that
is
true
major
tifto
you
was
very
rough
then
was
you
rough
a
man
bedroom
is
generally
supposed
to
be
private
yes
my
lord
that
true
i
ought
to
have
sent
your
man
in
first
i
came
then
to
confess
it
all
before
it
was
done
then
why
could
you
let
the
horse
alone
i
was
in
their
hands
and
then
you
was
so
rough
with
me
so
i
said
to
myself
i
might
as
well
do
it
and
i
did
it
what
do
you
want
me
to
say
as
far
as
my
forgiveness
goes
you
have
it
that
saying
a
great
deal
my
lord
a
great
deal
said
tifto
now
in
tears
but
i
ai
said
it
all
yet
he
here
in
london
who
here
green
he
here
he
does
think
that
i
know
but
i
could
lay
my
hand
on
him
there
is
no
human
being
alive
major
tifto
whose
presence
or
absence
could
be
a
matter
of
more
indifference
to
me
i
tell
you
what
i
do
my
lord
i
go
before
any
judge
or
magistrate
or
in
the
country
and
tell
the
truth
i
wo
ask
even
for
a
pardon
they
shall
punish
me
and
him
too
in
that
state
of
mind
that
any
change
would
be
for
the
better
but
he
he
ought
to
have
it
heavy
it
wo
be
done
by
me
major
tifto
look
here
major
tifto
you
have
come
here
to
confess
that
you
have
done
me
a
great
injury
yes
i
have
and
you
say
you
are
sorry
for
it
indeed
i
am
and
i
have
forgiven
you
there
is
only
one
way
in
which
you
can
show
your
gratitude
hold
your
tongue
about
it
let
it
be
as
a
thing
done
and
gone
the
money
has
been
paid
the
horse
has
been
sold
the
whole
thing
has
gone
out
of
my
mind
and
i
do
want
to
have
it
brought
back
again
and
nothing
is
to
be
done
to
green
i
should
say
nothing
on
that
score
and
he
has
got
they
say
thousand
pounds
clear
money
it
is
a
pity
but
it
can
not
be
helped
i
will
have
nothing
further
to
do
with
it
of
course
i
can
not
bind
you
but
i
have
told
you
my
wishes
the
poor
wretch
was
silent
but
still
it
seemed
as
though
he
did
not
wish
to
go
quite
yet
if
you
have
said
what
you
have
got
to
say
major
tifto
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
my
time
is
engaged
and
must
that
be
all
what
else
i
am
in
such
a
state
of
mind
lord
silverbridge
that
it
would
be
a
satisfaction
to
tell
it
all
even
against
myself
i
ca
prevent
you
then
tifto
got
up
from
his
chair
as
though
he
were
going
i
wish
i
knew
what
i
was
going
to
do
with
myself
i
do
know
that
i
can
help
you
major
tifto
i
suppose
not
my
lord
i
have
twenty
pounds
left
in
all
the
world
it
the
only
thing
that
was
square
that
ever
i
did
in
all
my
life
your
lordship
could
do
anything
for
me
we
was
very
much
together
at
one
time
my
lord
yes
major
tifto
we
were
of
course
i
was
a
villain
but
it
was
only
once
and
your
lordship
was
so
rough
to
me
i
am
not
saying
but
what
i
was
a
villain
think
of
what
i
did
for
myself
by
that
one
piece
of
wickedness
master
of
hounds
member
of
the
club
and
the
horse
would
have
run
in
my
name
and
won
the
leger
and
everybody
knew
as
your
lordship
and
me
was
together
in
him
then
he
burst
out
into
a
paroxysm
of
tears
and
sobbing
the
young
lord
certainly
could
not
take
the
man
into
partnership
again
nor
could
he
restore
to
him
either
the
hounds
or
his
club
or
his
clean
hands
nor
did
he
know
in
what
way
he
could
serve
the
man
except
by
putting
his
hand
into
his
pocket
which
he
did
tifto
accepted
the
gratuity
and
ultimately
became
an
annual
pensioner
on
his
former
noble
partner
living
on
the
allowance
made
him
in
some
obscure
corner
of
south
wales
chapter
lxxvi
on
deportment
frank
tregear
had
come
up
to
town
at
the
end
of
february
he
remained
in
london
with
an
understanding
that
he
was
not
to
see
lady
mary
again
till
the
easter
holidays
he
was
then
to
pay
a
visit
to
matching
and
to
enter
in
it
may
be
presumed
on
the
full
fruition
of
his
advantages
as
accepted
suitor
all
this
had
been
arranged
with
a
good
deal
of
precision
as
though
there
had
still
been
a
hope
left
that
lady
mary
might
change
her
mind
of
course
there
was
no
such
hope
when
the
duke
asked
the
young
man
to
dine
with
him
when
he
invited
him
to
drink
that
memorable
glass
of
wine
when
the
young
man
was
allowed
in
the
presence
of
the
boncassens
to
sit
next
lady
mary
it
was
of
course
settled
but
the
father
probably
found
some
relief
in
yielding
by
slow
degrees
i
would
rather
that
there
should
be
no
correspondence
till
then
he
had
said
both
to
tregear
and
to
his
daughter
and
they
had
promised
there
should
be
no
correspondence
at
easter
they
would
meet
after
easter
mary
was
to
come
up
to
london
to
be
present
at
her
brother
wedding
to
which
also
tregear
had
been
formally
invited
and
it
was
hoped
that
then
something
might
be
settled
as
to
their
own
marriage
tregear
with
the
surgeon
permission
took
his
seat
in
parliament
he
was
introduced
by
two
leading
members
on
the
conservative
side
but
immediately
afterwards
found
himself
seated
next
to
his
friend
silverbridge
on
the
top
bench
behind
the
ministers
the
house
was
very
full
as
there
was
a
feverish
report
abroad
that
sir
timothy
beeswax
intended
to
make
a
statement
no
one
quite
knew
what
the
statement
was
to
be
but
every
politician
in
the
house
and
out
of
it
thought
that
he
knew
that
the
statement
would
be
a
bid
for
higher
power
on
the
part
of
sir
timothy
himself
if
there
had
been
dissensions
in
the
cabinet
the
secret
of
them
had
been
well
kept
to
tregear
who
was
not
as
yet
familiar
with
the
house
there
was
no
special
appearance
of
activity
but
silverbridge
could
see
that
there
was
more
than
wonted
animation
that
the
treasury
bench
should
be
full
at
this
time
was
a
thing
of
custom
a
whole
broadside
of
questions
would
be
fired
off
one
after
another
like
a
rattle
of
musketry
down
the
ranks
when
as
nearly
as
possible
the
report
of
each
gun
is
made
to
follow
close
upon
that
of
the
gun
before
with
this
exception
that
in
such
case
each
little
sound
is
intended
to
be
as
like
as
possible
to
the
preceding
whereas
with
the
rattle
of
the
questions
and
answers
each
question
and
each
answer
becomes
a
little
more
authoritative
and
less
courteous
than
the
last
the
treasury
bench
was
ready
for
its
usual
responsive
firing
as
the
questioners
were
of
course
in
their
places
the
opposition
front
bench
was
also
crowded
and
those
behind
were
nearly
equally
full
there
were
many
peers
in
the
gallery
and
a
general
feeling
of
sensation
prevailed
all
this
silverbridge
had
been
long
enough
in
the
house
to
appreciate
but
to
tregear
the
house
was
simply
the
house
it
odd
enough
we
should
have
a
row
the
very
first
day
you
come
said
silverbridge
you
think
there
will
be
a
row
beeswax
has
something
special
to
say
he
not
here
yet
you
see
they
left
about
six
inches
for
him
there
between
roper
and
sir
orlando
you
have
the
privilege
of
looking
just
down
on
the
top
of
his
head
when
he
does
come
i
sha
stay
much
longer
after
that
where
are
you
going
i
do
mean
but
i
should
not
have
been
here
now
in
this
very
place
i
mean
but
i
want
to
stick
to
you
just
at
first
i
shall
move
down
below
the
gangway
and
not
improbably
creep
over
to
the
other
side
before
long
you
do
mean
it
i
think
i
shall
i
begin
to
feel
i
made
a
mistake
in
coming
to
this
side
at
all
i
think
i
have
after
all
it
is
not
very
important
what
is
not
important
i
think
it
very
important
perhaps
it
may
be
to
you
and
perhaps
you
may
be
able
to
keep
it
up
but
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
less
excuse
i
seem
to
have
for
deserting
the
old
ways
of
the
family
what
is
there
in
those
fellows
down
there
to
make
a
fellow
feel
that
he
ought
to
bind
himself
to
them
neck
and
heels
their
principles
yes
their
principles
i
believe
i
have
some
vague
idea
as
to
supporting
property
and
land
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
i
do
know
that
anybody
wants
to
attack
anything
somebody
soon
would
want
to
attack
it
if
there
were
no
defenders
i
suppose
there
is
an
outside
power
the
people
or
public
opinion
or
whatever
they
choose
to
call
it
and
the
country
will
have
to
go
very
much
as
that
outside
power
chooses
here
in
parliament
everybody
will
be
as
conservative
as
the
outside
will
let
them
i
do
think
it
matters
on
which
side
you
sit
but
it
does
matter
that
you
should
have
to
act
with
those
who
go
against
the
grain
with
you
i
never
heard
a
worse
political
argument
in
my
life
i
dare
say
not
however
here
sir
timothy
when
he
looks
in
that
way
all
buckram
deportment
and
solemnity
i
know
he
going
to
pitch
into
somebody
at
this
moment
the
leader
of
the
house
came
in
from
behind
the
speaker
chair
and
took
his
place
between
roper
and
sir
orlando
drought
silverbridge
had
been
right
in
saying
that
sir
timothy
air
was
solemn
when
a
man
has
to
declare
a
solemn
purpose
on
a
solemn
occasion
in
a
solemn
place
it
is
needful
that
he
should
be
solemn
himself
and
though
the
solemnity
which
befits
a
man
best
will
be
that
which
the
importance
of
the
moment
may
produce
without
thought
given
by
himself
to
his
own
outward
person
still
who
is
there
can
refrain
himself
from
some
attempt
who
can
boast
who
that
has
been
versed
in
the
ways
and
duties
of
high
places
that
he
has
kept
himself
free
from
all
study
of
grace
of
feature
of
attitude
of
gait
or
even
of
dress
for
most
of
our
bishops
for
most
of
our
judges
of
our
statesmen
our
orators
our
generals
for
many
even
of
our
doctors
and
our
parsons
even
our
attorneys
our
and
certainly
our
butlers
and
our
coachmen
turveydrop
the
great
professor
of
deportment
has
done
much
but
there
should
always
be
the
art
to
underlie
and
protect
the
art
the
art
that
can
hide
the
art
the
really
clever
archbishop
the
really
potent
chief
justice
the
man
who
as
a
politician
will
succeed
in
becoming
a
king
of
men
should
know
how
to
carry
his
buckram
without
showing
it
it
was
in
this
that
sir
timothy
perhaps
failed
a
little
there
are
men
who
look
as
though
they
were
born
to
wear
blue
ribbons
it
has
come
probably
from
study
but
it
seems
to
be
natural
sir
timothy
did
not
impose
on
those
who
looked
at
him
as
do
these
men
you
could
see
a
little
of
the
paint
you
could
hear
the
crumple
of
the
starch
and
the
padding
you
could
trace
something
of
uneasiness
in
the
composed
grandeur
of
the
brow
turveydrop
the
spectator
would
say
to
himself
but
after
all
it
may
be
a
question
whether
a
man
be
open
to
reproach
for
not
doing
that
well
which
the
greatest
among
us
if
we
could
find
one
great
enough
would
not
do
at
all
for
i
think
we
must
hold
that
true
personal
dignity
should
be
achieved
must
if
it
be
quite
true
have
been
achieved
without
any
personal
effort
though
it
be
evinced
in
part
by
the
carriage
of
the
body
that
carriage
should
be
the
fruit
of
the
operation
of
the
mind
even
when
it
be
assisted
by
external
garniture
such
as
special
clothes
and
wigs
and
ornaments
such
garniture
should
have
been
prescribed
by
the
sovereign
or
by
custom
and
should
not
have
been
selected
by
the
wearer
in
regard
to
speech
a
man
may
study
all
that
which
may
make
him
suasive
but
if
he
go
beyond
that
he
will
trench
on
those
histrionic
efforts
which
he
will
know
to
be
wrong
because
he
will
be
ashamed
to
acknowledge
them
it
is
good
to
be
beautiful
but
it
should
come
of
god
and
not
of
the
hairdresser
and
personal
dignity
is
a
great
possession
but
a
man
should
struggle
for
it
no
more
than
he
would
for
beauty
many
however
do
struggle
for
it
and
with
such
success
that
though
they
do
not
achieve
quite
the
real
thing
still
they
get
something
on
which
they
can
bolster
themselves
up
and
be
mighty
others
older
men
than
silverbridge
saw
as
much
as
did
our
young
friend
but
they
were
more
complaisant
and
more
reasonable
they
too
heard
the
crackle
of
the
buckram
and
were
aware
that
the
last
touch
of
awe
had
come
upon
that
brow
just
as
its
owner
was
emerging
from
the
shadow
of
the
speaker
chair
but
to
them
it
was
a
thing
of
course
a
real
cæsar
is
not
to
be
found
every
day
nor
can
we
always
have
a
pitt
to
control
our
debates
that
kind
of
thing
that
last
touch
has
its
effect
of
course
it
is
all
paint
but
how
would
the
poor
girl
look
before
the
gaslights
if
there
were
no
paint
the
house
of
commons
likes
a
little
deportment
on
occasions
if
a
special
man
looks
bigger
than
you
you
can
console
yourself
by
reflecting
that
he
also
looks
bigger
than
your
fellows
sir
timothy
probably
knew
what
he
was
about
and
did
himself
on
the
whole
more
good
than
harm
by
his
little
tricks
as
soon
as
sir
timothy
had
taken
his
seat
rattler
got
up
from
the
opposition
bench
to
ask
him
some
question
on
a
matter
of
finance
the
brewers
were
anxious
about
publican
licences
could
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
say
a
word
on
the
matter
notice
had
of
course
been
given
and
the
questioner
had
stated
a
quarter
of
an
hour
previously
that
he
would
postpone
his
query
till
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
was
in
the
house
sir
timothy
rose
from
his
seat
and
in
his
blandest
manner
began
by
apologising
for
his
late
appearance
he
was
sorry
that
he
had
been
prevented
by
public
business
from
being
in
his
place
to
answer
the
honourable
gentleman
question
in
its
proper
turn
and
even
now
he
feared
that
he
must
decline
to
give
any
answer
which
could
be
supposed
to
be
satisfactory
it
would
probably
be
his
duty
to
make
a
statement
to
the
house
on
the
following
day
a
statement
which
he
was
not
quite
prepared
to
make
at
the
present
moment
but
in
the
existing
state
of
things
he
was
unwilling
to
make
any
reply
to
any
question
by
which
he
might
seem
to
bind
the
government
to
any
opinion
then
he
sat
down
and
rising
again
not
long
afterwards
when
the
house
had
gone
through
certain
formal
duties
he
moved
that
it
should
be
adjourned
till
the
next
day
then
all
the
members
trooped
out
and
with
the
others
tregear
and
lord
silverbridge
so
that
is
the
end
of
your
first
day
of
parliament
said
silverbridge
what
does
it
all
mean
let
us
go
to
the
carlton
and
hear
what
the
fellows
are
saying
on
that
evening
both
the
young
men
dined
at
boncassen
house
though
tregear
had
been
cautioned
not
to
write
to
lady
mary
and
though
he
was
not
to
see
her
before
easter
still
it
was
so
completely
understood
that
he
was
about
to
become
her
husband
that
he
was
entertained
in
that
capacity
by
all
those
who
were
concerned
in
the
family
and
so
they
will
all
go
out
said
boncassen
that
seems
to
be
the
general
idea
said
the
expectant
when
two
men
want
to
be
first
and
neither
will
give
way
they
very
well
get
on
in
the
same
boat
together
then
he
expatiated
angrily
on
the
treachery
of
sir
timothy
and
tregear
in
a
more
moderate
way
joined
in
the
same
opinion
upon
my
word
young
men
i
doubt
whether
you
are
right
said
boncassen
whether
it
can
be
possible
that
a
man
should
have
risen
to
such
a
position
with
so
little
patriotism
as
you
attribute
to
our
friend
i
will
not
pretend
to
say
i
should
think
that
in
england
it
was
impossible
but
of
this
i
am
sure
that
the
facility
which
exists
here
for
a
minister
or
ministers
to
go
out
of
office
without
disturbance
of
the
crown
is
a
great
blessing
you
say
the
other
party
will
come
in
that
is
most
probable
said
silverbridge
with
us
the
other
party
never
comes
in
never
has
a
chance
of
coming
in
except
once
in
four
years
when
the
president
is
elected
that
one
event
binds
us
all
for
four
years
but
you
do
change
your
ministers
said
tregear
a
secretary
may
quarrel
with
the
president
or
he
may
have
the
gout
or
be
convicted
of
peculation
and
yet
you
think
yourselves
more
nearly
free
than
we
are
i
am
not
so
sure
of
that
we
have
had
a
pretty
difficult
task
that
of
carrying
on
a
government
in
a
new
country
which
is
nevertheless
more
populous
than
almost
any
old
country
the
influxions
are
so
rapid
that
every
ten
years
the
nature
of
the
people
is
changed
it
is
easy
and
though
i
think
on
the
whole
we
done
pretty
well
i
am
not
going
to
boast
that
washington
is
as
yet
the
seat
of
a
political
paradise
chapter
lxxvii
mabel
when
tregear
first
came
to
town
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
and
bandages
all
round
him
in
order
that
he
might
be
formally
accepted
by
the
duke
he
had
himself
taken
to
one
other
house
besides
the
house
in
carlton
terrace
he
went
to
belgrave
square
to
announce
his
fate
to
lady
mabel
grex
but
lady
mabel
grex
was
not
there
the
earl
was
ill
at
brighton
and
lady
mabel
had
gone
down
to
nurse
him
the
old
woman
who
came
to
him
in
the
hall
told
him
that
the
earl
was
very
ill
he
had
been
attacked
by
the
gout
but
in
spite
of
the
gout
and
in
spite
of
the
doctors
he
had
insisted
on
being
taken
to
his
club
then
he
had
been
removed
to
brighton
under
the
doctor
advice
chiefly
in
order
that
he
might
be
kept
out
of
the
way
of
temptation
now
he
was
supposed
to
be
very
ill
indeed
my
lord
is
so
imprudent
said
the
old
woman
shaking
her
old
head
in
real
unhappiness
for
though
the
earl
had
been
a
tyrant
to
everyone
near
him
yet
when
a
poor
woman
becomes
old
it
is
something
to
have
a
tyrant
to
protect
her
my
lord
always
had
been
imprudent
tregear
knew
that
it
had
been
the
theory
of
my
lord
life
that
to
eat
and
drink
and
die
was
better
than
to
abstain
and
live
then
tregear
wrote
to
his
friend
as
follows
my
dear
mabel
i
am
up
in
town
again
as
you
will
perceive
although
i
am
still
in
a
helpless
condition
and
hardly
able
to
write
even
this
letter
i
called
and
was
very
sorry
to
hear
so
bad
an
account
of
your
father
had
i
been
able
to
travel
i
should
have
come
down
to
you
when
i
am
able
i
will
do
so
if
you
would
wish
to
see
me
in
the
meantime
pray
tell
me
how
he
is
and
how
you
are
my
news
is
this
the
duke
has
accepted
me
it
is
great
news
to
me
and
i
hope
will
be
acceptable
to
you
i
do
believe
that
if
ever
a
friend
has
been
anxious
for
a
friend
welfare
you
have
been
anxious
for
mine
as
i
have
been
and
ever
shall
be
for
yours
of
course
this
thing
will
be
very
much
to
me
i
will
not
speak
now
of
my
love
for
the
girl
who
is
to
become
my
wife
you
might
again
call
me
romeo
nor
do
i
like
to
say
much
of
what
may
now
be
pecuniary
prospects
i
did
not
ask
mary
to
become
my
wife
because
i
supposed
she
would
be
rich
but
i
could
not
have
married
her
or
any
one
else
who
had
not
money
what
are
the
duke
intentions
i
have
not
the
slightest
idea
nor
shall
i
ask
him
i
am
to
go
down
to
matching
at
easter
and
shall
endeavour
to
have
some
time
fixed
i
suppose
the
duke
will
say
something
about
money
if
he
does
not
i
shall
not
pray
write
to
me
at
once
and
tell
me
when
i
shall
see
you
your
affectionate
cousin
tregear
in
answer
to
this
there
came
a
note
in
a
very
few
words
she
congratulated
him
not
very
warmly
but
expressed
a
hope
that
she
might
see
him
soon
but
she
told
him
not
to
come
to
brighton
the
earl
was
better
but
very
cross
and
she
would
be
up
in
town
before
long
towards
the
end
of
the
month
it
became
suddenly
known
in
london
that
lord
grex
had
died
at
brighton
there
was
a
garter
to
be
given
away
and
everybody
was
filled
with
regret
that
such
an
ornament
to
the
peerage
should
have
departed
from
them
the
conservative
papers
remembered
how
excellent
a
politician
he
had
been
in
his
younger
days
and
the
world
was
informed
that
the
family
of
grex
of
grex
was
about
the
oldest
in
great
britain
of
which
authentic
records
were
in
existence
then
there
came
another
note
from
lady
mabel
to
tregear
i
shall
be
in
town
on
the
in
the
old
house
with
miss
cassewary
and
will
see
you
if
you
can
come
on
the
come
early
at
eleven
if
you
can
on
the
day
named
and
at
the
hour
fixed
he
was
in
belgrave
square
he
had
known
this
house
since
he
was
a
boy
and
could
well
remember
how
when
he
first
entered
it
he
had
thought
with
some
awe
of
the
grandeur
of
the
earl
the
earl
had
then
not
paid
much
attention
to
him
but
he
had
become
very
much
taken
by
the
grace
and
of
the
girl
who
had
owned
him
as
a
cousin
you
are
my
cousin
frank
she
had
said
i
am
so
glad
to
have
a
cousin
he
could
remember
the
words
now
as
though
they
had
been
spoken
only
yesterday
then
there
had
quickly
grown
to
be
friendship
between
him
and
this
as
he
thought
sweetest
of
all
girls
at
that
time
he
had
just
gone
to
eton
but
before
he
left
eton
they
had
sworn
to
love
each
other
and
so
it
had
been
and
the
thing
had
grown
till
at
last
just
when
he
had
taken
his
degree
two
matters
had
been
settled
between
them
the
first
was
that
each
loved
the
other
irretrievably
irrevocably
passionately
the
second
that
it
was
altogether
out
of
the
question
that
they
should
ever
marry
each
other
it
is
but
fair
to
tregear
to
say
that
this
last
decision
originated
with
the
lady
he
had
told
her
that
he
certainly
would
hold
himself
engaged
to
marry
her
at
some
future
time
but
she
had
thrown
this
aside
at
once
how
was
it
possible
she
said
that
two
such
beings
brought
up
in
luxury
and
taught
to
enjoy
all
the
good
things
of
the
world
should
expect
to
live
and
be
happy
together
without
an
income
he
offered
to
go
to
the
bar
but
she
asked
him
whether
he
thought
it
well
that
such
a
one
as
she
should
wait
say
a
dozen
years
for
such
a
process
when
the
time
comes
i
should
be
an
old
woman
and
you
would
be
a
wretched
man
she
released
him
declared
her
own
purpose
of
marrying
well
and
then
though
there
had
been
a
moment
in
which
her
own
assurance
of
her
own
love
had
been
passionate
enough
she
went
so
far
as
to
tell
him
that
she
was
we
have
been
two
foolish
children
but
we
can
not
be
children
any
longer
she
said
there
must
be
an
end
of
it
what
had
hitherto
been
the
result
of
this
the
reader
knows
and
tregear
knew
also
he
had
taken
the
privilege
given
to
him
and
had
made
so
complete
a
use
of
it
that
he
had
in
truth
transferred
his
heart
as
well
as
his
allegiance
where
is
the
young
man
who
can
not
do
so
how
few
are
there
who
do
not
do
so
when
their
first
fit
of
passion
has
come
on
them
at
and
he
had
thought
that
she
would
do
the
same
but
gradually
he
found
that
she
had
not
done
so
did
not
do
so
could
not
do
so
when
she
first
heard
of
lady
mary
she
had
not
reprimanded
him
but
she
could
not
keep
herself
from
showing
the
bitterness
of
her
disappointment
though
she
would
still
boast
of
her
own
strength
and
of
her
own
purpose
yet
it
was
too
clear
to
him
that
she
was
wounded
and
very
sore
she
would
have
liked
him
to
remain
single
at
any
rate
till
she
herself
were
married
but
the
permission
had
been
hardly
given
before
he
availed
himself
of
it
and
then
he
talked
to
her
not
only
of
the
brilliancy
of
his
prospects
which
she
could
have
forgiven
but
of
his
love
his
love
then
she
had
refused
one
offer
after
another
and
he
had
known
it
all
there
was
nothing
in
which
she
was
concerned
that
she
did
not
tell
him
then
young
silverbridge
had
come
across
her
and
she
had
determined
that
he
should
be
her
husband
she
had
been
nearly
successful
so
nearly
that
at
moments
she
had
felt
sure
of
success
but
the
prize
had
slipped
from
her
through
her
own
fault
she
knew
well
enough
that
it
was
her
own
fault
when
a
girl
submits
to
play
such
a
game
as
that
she
should
not
stand
on
too
nice
scruples
she
had
told
herself
this
many
a
time
since
but
the
prize
was
gone
all
this
tregear
knew
and
knowing
it
almost
dreaded
the
coming
interview
he
could
not
without
actual
cruelty
have
avoided
her
had
he
done
so
before
he
could
not
have
continued
to
do
so
now
when
she
was
left
alone
in
the
world
her
father
had
not
been
much
to
her
but
still
his
presence
had
enabled
her
to
put
herself
before
the
world
as
being
somebody
now
she
would
be
almost
nobody
and
she
had
lost
her
rich
prize
while
he
out
of
the
same
treasury
as
it
were
had
won
his
the
door
was
opened
to
him
by
the
same
old
woman
and
he
was
shown
at
a
funereal
pace
up
into
the
which
he
had
known
so
well
he
was
told
that
lady
mabel
would
be
down
to
him
directly
as
he
looked
about
him
he
could
see
that
already
had
been
commenced
that
work
of
division
of
spoil
which
is
sure
to
follow
the
death
of
most
of
us
things
were
already
gone
which
used
to
be
familiar
to
his
eyes
and
the
room
though
not
dismantled
had
been
deprived
of
many
of
its
little
prettinesses
and
was
ugly
in
about
ten
minutes
she
came
down
to
him
with
so
soft
a
step
that
he
would
not
have
been
aware
of
her
entrance
had
he
not
seen
her
form
in
the
mirror
then
when
he
turned
round
to
greet
her
he
was
astonished
by
the
blackness
of
her
appearance
she
looked
as
though
she
had
become
ten
years
older
since
he
had
last
seen
her
as
she
came
up
to
him
she
was
grave
and
almost
solemn
in
her
gait
but
there
was
no
sign
of
any
tears
why
should
there
have
been
a
tear
women
weep
and
men
too
not
from
grief
but
from
emotion
indeed
grave
and
slow
as
was
her
step
and
serious
almost
solemn
as
was
her
gait
there
was
something
of
a
smile
on
her
mouth
as
she
gave
him
her
hand
and
yet
her
face
was
very
sad
declaring
to
him
too
plainly
something
of
the
hopelessness
of
her
heart
and
so
the
duke
has
consented
she
said
he
had
told
her
that
in
his
letter
but
since
that
her
father
had
died
and
she
had
been
left
he
did
not
as
yet
know
how
far
impoverished
but
he
feared
with
no
pleasant
worldly
prospects
before
her
yes
mabel
that
i
suppose
will
be
settled
i
have
been
so
shocked
to
hear
all
this
it
has
been
very
sad
has
it
not
sit
down
frank
you
and
i
have
a
good
deal
to
say
to
each
other
now
that
we
have
met
it
was
no
good
your
going
down
to
brighton
he
would
not
have
seen
you
and
at
last
i
never
left
him
was
percival
there
she
only
shook
her
head
that
was
dreadful
it
was
not
percival
fault
he
would
not
see
him
nor
till
the
last
hour
or
two
would
he
believe
in
his
own
danger
nor
was
he
ever
frightened
for
a
moment
not
even
then
was
he
good
to
you
good
to
me
well
he
liked
my
being
there
poor
papa
it
had
gone
so
far
with
him
that
he
could
not
be
good
to
any
one
i
think
that
he
felt
that
it
would
be
unmanly
not
to
be
the
same
to
the
end
he
would
not
see
percival
when
it
was
suggested
he
would
only
ask
what
good
percival
could
do
him
i
did
send
for
him
at
last
in
my
terror
but
he
did
not
see
his
father
alive
when
he
did
come
he
only
told
me
how
badly
his
father
had
treated
him
it
was
very
dreadful
i
did
so
feel
for
you
i
am
sure
you
did
and
will
after
all
frank
i
think
that
the
pious
godly
people
have
the
best
of
it
in
this
world
let
them
be
ever
so
covetous
ever
so
false
ever
so
the
mere
fact
that
they
must
keep
up
appearances
makes
them
comfortable
to
those
around
them
poor
papa
was
not
comfortable
to
me
a
little
hypocrisy
a
little
sacrifice
to
the
feelings
of
the
world
may
be
such
a
blessing
i
am
sorry
that
you
should
feel
it
so
yes
it
is
sad
but
you
everything
is
smiling
with
you
let
us
talk
about
your
plans
another
time
will
do
for
that
i
had
come
to
hear
about
your
own
affairs
there
they
are
she
said
pointing
round
the
room
i
have
no
other
affairs
you
see
that
i
am
going
from
here
and
where
are
you
going
she
shook
her
head
with
whom
will
you
live
with
miss
cass
two
old
maids
together
i
know
nothing
further
but
about
money
that
is
if
i
am
justified
in
asking
what
would
you
not
be
justified
in
asking
do
you
not
know
that
i
would
tell
you
every
secret
of
my
heart
if
my
heart
had
a
secret
it
seems
that
i
have
given
up
what
was
to
have
been
my
fortune
there
was
a
claim
of
on
grex
but
i
have
abandoned
it
and
there
is
nothing
there
will
be
scrapings
they
tell
me
unless
percival
refuses
to
agree
this
house
is
mortgaged
but
not
for
its
value
and
there
are
some
jewels
but
all
that
is
detestable
a
mere
grovelling
among
mean
hundreds
whereas
you
you
will
soar
among
oh
mabel
do
not
say
hard
things
to
me
no
indeed
why
should
i
i
who
have
been
preaching
that
comfortable
doctrine
of
hypocrisy
i
will
say
nothing
hard
but
i
would
sooner
talk
of
your
good
things
than
of
my
evil
ones
i
would
not
then
you
must
talk
about
them
for
my
sake
how
was
it
that
the
duke
came
round
at
last
i
hardly
know
she
sent
for
me
a
fine
girl
these
pallisers
have
more
courage
about
them
than
one
expects
from
their
outward
manner
silverbridge
has
plenty
of
it
i
remember
telling
you
he
could
be
obstinate
and
i
remember
that
i
did
not
believe
you
now
i
know
it
he
has
the
sort
of
pluck
which
enables
a
man
to
break
a
girl
heart
or
to
destroy
a
girl
hopes
without
wincing
he
can
tell
a
girl
to
her
face
that
she
can
go
to
the
mischief
for
him
there
are
so
many
men
who
ca
do
that
from
cowardice
though
their
hearts
be
ever
so
well
inclined
have
changed
my
mind
there
is
something
great
in
the
courage
of
a
man
who
can
say
that
to
a
woman
in
so
many
words
most
of
them
when
they
escape
escape
by
lies
and
subterfuges
or
they
run
away
and
wo
allow
themselves
to
be
heard
of
they
trust
to
a
chapter
of
accidents
and
leave
things
to
arrange
themselves
but
when
a
man
can
look
a
girl
in
the
face
with
those
seemingly
soft
eyes
and
say
with
that
seemingly
soft
mouth
have
changed
my
mind
though
she
would
look
him
dead
in
return
if
she
could
still
she
must
admire
him
are
you
speaking
of
silverbridge
now
of
course
i
am
speaking
of
silverbridge
i
suppose
i
ought
to
hide
it
all
and
not
to
tell
you
but
as
you
are
the
only
person
i
do
tell
you
must
put
up
with
me
yes
when
i
taxed
him
with
his
falsehood
for
he
had
been
false
he
answered
me
with
those
very
words
have
changed
my
mind
he
could
not
lie
to
speak
the
truth
was
a
necessity
to
him
even
at
the
expense
of
his
gallantry
almost
of
his
humanity
has
he
been
false
to
you
mabel
of
course
he
has
but
there
is
nothing
to
quarrel
about
if
you
mean
that
people
do
not
quarrel
now
about
such
things
a
girl
has
to
fight
her
own
battle
with
her
own
pluck
and
her
own
wits
as
with
these
weapons
she
is
generally
stronger
than
her
enemy
she
succeeds
sometimes
although
everything
else
is
against
her
i
think
i
am
courageous
but
his
courage
beat
mine
i
craned
at
the
first
fence
when
he
was
willing
to
swallow
my
bait
my
hand
was
not
firm
enough
to
strike
the
hook
in
his
jaws
had
i
not
quailed
then
i
think
i
should
have
him
it
is
horrid
to
hear
you
talk
like
this
she
was
leaning
over
from
her
seat
looking
black
as
she
was
so
much
older
than
her
wont
with
something
about
her
of
that
unworldly
serious
thoughtfulness
which
a
mourning
garb
always
gives
and
yet
her
words
were
so
worldly
so
unfeminine
i
have
got
to
tell
the
truth
to
somebody
it
was
so
just
as
i
have
said
of
course
i
did
not
love
him
how
could
i
love
him
after
what
has
passed
but
there
need
have
been
nothing
much
in
that
i
suppose
that
dukes
eldest
sons
often
get
married
for
love
miss
boncassen
loves
him
i
dare
say
the
beggar
daughter
loved
king
cophetua
when
you
come
to
distances
such
as
that
there
can
be
love
the
very
fact
that
a
man
should
have
descended
so
far
in
quest
of
beauty
the
flattery
of
it
alone
will
produce
love
when
the
angels
came
after
the
daughters
of
men
of
course
the
daughters
of
men
loved
them
the
distance
between
him
and
me
is
not
great
enough
to
have
produced
that
sort
of
worship
there
was
no
reason
why
lady
mabel
grex
should
not
be
good
enough
wife
for
the
son
of
the
duke
of
omnium
certainly
not
and
therefore
i
was
not
struck
as
by
the
shining
of
a
light
from
heaven
i
can
not
say
i
loved
him
frank
i
am
beyond
worshipping
even
an
angel
from
heaven
then
i
do
not
know
that
you
could
blame
him
he
said
very
seriously
just
so
and
as
i
have
chosen
to
be
honest
i
have
told
him
everything
but
i
had
my
revenge
first
i
would
have
said
nothing
you
would
have
recommended
delicacy
no
doubt
you
think
that
women
should
be
delicate
let
them
suffer
what
they
may
a
woman
should
not
let
it
be
known
that
she
has
any
human
nature
in
her
i
had
him
on
the
hip
and
for
a
moment
i
used
my
power
he
had
certainly
done
me
a
wrong
he
had
asked
for
my
love
and
with
the
delicacy
which
you
commend
i
had
not
at
once
grasped
at
all
that
such
a
request
conveyed
then
as
he
told
me
so
frankly
changed
his
mind
did
he
not
wrong
me
he
should
not
have
raised
false
hopes
he
told
me
that
he
had
changed
his
mind
i
think
i
loved
him
then
as
nearly
as
ever
i
did
because
he
looked
me
full
in
the
face
then
i
told
him
i
had
never
cared
for
him
and
that
he
need
have
nothing
on
his
conscience
but
i
doubt
whether
he
was
glad
to
hear
it
men
are
so
vain
i
have
talked
too
much
of
myself
and
so
you
are
to
be
the
duke
and
she
will
have
hundreds
of
thousands
thousands
perhaps
but
i
do
not
think
very
much
about
it
i
feel
that
he
will
provide
for
her
and
that
you
having
secured
her
can
creep
under
his
wing
like
an
additional
ducal
chick
it
is
very
comfortable
the
duke
will
be
quite
a
providence
to
you
i
wonder
that
all
young
gentlemen
do
not
marry
heiresses
it
is
so
easy
and
you
have
got
your
seat
in
parliament
too
oh
your
luck
when
i
look
back
upon
it
all
it
seems
so
hard
to
me
it
was
for
you
for
you
that
i
used
to
be
anxious
now
it
is
i
who
have
not
an
inch
of
ground
to
stand
upon
then
he
approached
her
and
put
out
his
hand
to
her
no
she
said
putting
both
her
hands
behind
her
back
for
god
sake
let
there
be
no
tenderness
but
is
it
not
cruel
think
of
my
advantages
at
that
moment
when
you
and
i
agreed
that
our
paths
should
be
separate
my
fortune
then
had
not
been
made
quite
shipwreck
by
my
father
and
brother
i
had
before
me
all
that
society
could
offer
i
was
called
handsome
and
clever
where
was
there
a
girl
more
likely
to
make
her
way
to
the
top
you
may
do
so
still
no
no
i
can
not
and
you
at
least
should
not
tell
me
so
i
did
not
know
then
the
virulence
of
the
malady
which
had
fallen
on
me
i
did
not
know
then
that
because
of
you
other
men
would
be
abhorrent
to
me
i
thought
that
i
was
as
as
you
have
proved
yourself
how
cruel
you
can
be
have
i
done
anything
to
interfere
with
you
have
i
said
a
word
even
to
that
young
lad
when
i
might
have
said
a
word
yes
to
him
i
did
say
something
but
i
waited
and
would
not
say
it
while
a
word
could
hurt
you
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
told
him
just
everything
that
has
ever
happened
between
you
and
me
you
did
yes
because
i
saw
that
i
could
trust
him
i
told
him
because
i
wanted
him
to
be
quite
sure
that
i
had
never
loved
him
but
frank
i
have
put
no
spoke
in
your
wheel
there
has
not
been
a
moment
since
you
told
me
of
your
love
for
this
rich
young
lady
in
which
i
would
not
have
helped
you
had
help
been
in
my
power
whomever
i
may
have
harmed
i
have
never
harmed
you
am
i
not
as
clear
from
blame
towards
you
no
frank
you
have
done
me
the
terrible
evil
of
ceasing
to
love
me
it
was
at
your
own
bidding
certainly
but
if
i
were
to
bid
you
to
cut
my
throat
would
you
do
it
was
it
not
you
who
decided
that
we
could
not
wait
for
each
other
and
should
it
not
have
been
for
you
to
decide
that
you
would
wait
you
also
would
have
married
it
almost
angers
me
that
you
should
not
see
the
difference
a
girl
unless
she
marries
becomes
nothing
as
i
have
become
nothing
now
a
man
does
not
want
a
pillar
on
which
to
lean
a
man
when
he
has
done
as
you
had
done
with
me
and
made
a
girl
heart
all
his
own
even
though
his
own
heart
had
been
flexible
and
plastic
as
yours
is
should
have
been
true
to
her
at
least
for
a
while
did
it
never
occur
to
you
that
you
owed
something
to
me
i
have
always
owed
you
very
much
there
should
have
been
some
touch
of
chivalry
if
not
of
love
to
make
you
feel
that
a
second
passion
should
have
been
postponed
for
a
year
or
two
you
could
wait
without
growing
old
you
might
have
allowed
yourself
a
little
space
to
dwell
i
was
going
to
say
on
the
sweetness
of
your
memories
but
they
were
not
sweet
frank
they
were
not
sweet
to
you
these
rebukes
mabel
will
rob
them
of
their
sweetness
for
a
time
it
is
gone
all
gone
she
said
shaking
her
head
gone
from
me
because
i
have
been
so
easily
deserted
gone
from
you
because
the
change
has
been
so
easy
to
you
how
long
was
it
frank
after
you
had
left
me
before
you
were
basking
happily
in
the
smiles
of
lady
mary
palliser
it
was
not
very
long
as
months
go
say
days
frank
i
have
to
defend
myself
and
i
will
do
so
with
truth
it
was
not
very
long
as
months
go
but
why
should
it
have
been
less
long
whether
for
months
or
days
i
had
to
cure
myself
of
a
wound
to
put
a
plaster
on
a
scratch
frank
and
the
sooner
a
man
can
do
that
the
more
manly
he
is
is
it
a
sign
of
strength
to
wail
under
a
sorrow
that
can
not
be
cured
or
of
truth
to
perpetuate
the
appearance
of
a
woe
has
it
been
an
appearance
with
me
i
am
speaking
of
myself
now
i
am
driven
to
speak
of
myself
by
the
bitterness
of
your
words
it
was
you
who
decided
you
accepted
my
decision
easily
because
it
was
based
not
only
on
my
unfitness
for
such
a
marriage
but
on
yours
when
i
saw
that
there
would
be
perhaps
some
years
of
misery
for
you
of
course
i
accepted
your
decision
the
sweetness
had
been
very
sweet
to
me
oh
frank
was
it
ever
sweet
to
you
and
the
triumph
of
it
had
been
very
great
i
had
been
assured
of
the
love
of
her
who
among
all
the
high
ones
of
the
world
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
highest
then
came
your
decision
do
you
really
believe
that
i
could
abandon
the
sweetness
that
i
could
be
robbed
of
my
triumph
that
i
could
think
i
could
never
again
be
allowed
to
put
my
arm
round
your
waist
never
again
to
feel
your
cheek
close
to
mine
that
i
should
lose
all
that
had
seemed
left
to
me
among
the
gods
without
feeling
it
frank
frank
she
said
rising
to
her
feet
and
stretching
out
her
hands
as
though
she
were
going
to
give
him
back
all
these
joys
of
course
i
felt
it
i
did
not
then
know
what
was
before
me
when
he
said
this
she
sank
back
immediately
upon
her
seat
i
was
wretched
enough
i
had
lost
a
limb
and
could
not
walk
my
eyes
and
must
always
hereafter
be
blind
my
fitness
to
be
among
men
and
must
always
hereafter
be
secluded
it
is
so
that
a
man
is
stricken
down
when
some
terrible
trouble
comes
upon
him
but
it
is
given
to
him
to
retrick
his
beams
you
have
retricked
yours
yes
and
the
strong
man
will
show
his
strength
by
doing
it
quickly
mabel
i
sorrowed
for
myself
greatly
when
that
word
was
spoken
partly
because
i
thought
that
your
love
could
so
easily
be
taken
from
me
and
since
i
have
found
that
it
has
not
been
so
i
have
sorrowed
for
you
also
but
i
do
not
blame
myself
and
and
i
will
not
submit
to
have
blame
even
from
you
she
stared
him
in
the
face
as
he
said
this
a
man
should
never
submit
to
blame
but
if
he
has
deserved
it
who
is
to
be
the
judge
but
why
should
we
contest
this
you
do
not
really
wish
to
trample
on
me
no
not
that
nor
to
disgrace
me
nor
to
make
me
feel
myself
disgraced
in
my
own
judgment
then
there
was
a
pause
for
some
moments
as
though
he
had
left
her
without
another
word
to
say
shall
i
go
now
he
asked
oh
frank
i
fear
that
my
presence
only
makes
you
unhappy
then
what
will
your
absence
do
when
shall
i
see
you
again
but
no
i
will
not
see
you
again
not
for
many
days
not
for
years
why
should
i
frank
is
it
wicked
that
i
should
love
you
he
could
only
shake
his
head
in
answer
to
this
if
it
be
so
wicked
that
i
must
be
punished
for
it
eternally
still
i
love
you
i
can
never
never
never
love
another
you
can
not
understand
it
oh
god
that
i
had
never
understood
it
myself
i
think
i
think
that
i
would
go
with
you
now
anywhere
facing
all
misery
all
judgments
all
disgrace
you
know
do
you
not
that
if
it
were
possible
i
should
not
say
so
but
as
i
know
that
you
would
not
stir
a
step
with
me
i
do
say
so
i
know
it
is
not
meant
it
is
meant
though
it
could
not
be
done
frank
i
must
not
see
her
not
for
awhile
not
for
years
i
do
not
wish
to
hate
her
but
how
can
i
help
it
do
you
remember
when
she
flew
into
your
arms
in
this
room
i
remember
it
of
course
you
do
it
is
your
great
joy
now
to
remember
that
and
such
like
she
must
be
very
good
though
i
hate
her
do
not
say
that
you
hate
her
mabel
though
i
hate
her
she
must
be
good
it
was
a
fine
and
a
brave
thing
to
do
i
have
done
it
but
never
before
the
world
like
that
have
i
frank
oh
frank
i
shall
never
do
it
again
go
now
and
do
not
touch
me
let
us
both
pray
that
in
ten
years
we
may
meet
as
passionless
friends
he
came
to
her
hardly
knowing
what
he
meant
but
purposing
as
though
by
instinct
to
take
her
hand
as
he
parted
from
her
but
she
putting
both
her
hands
before
her
face
and
throwing
herself
on
to
the
sofa
buried
her
head
among
the
cushions
is
there
not
to
be
another
word
he
said
lying
as
she
did
she
still
was
able
to
make
a
movement
of
dissent
and
he
left
her
muttering
just
one
word
between
his
teeth
mabel
chapter
lxxviii
the
duke
returns
to
office
that
farewell
took
place
on
the
friday
morning
tregear
as
he
walked
out
of
the
square
knew
now
that
he
had
been
the
cause
of
a
great
shipwreck
at
first
when
that
passionate
love
had
been
declared
he
could
hardly
remember
whether
with
the
fullest
passion
by
him
or
by
her
he
had
been
as
a
god
walking
upon
air
that
she
who
seemed
to
be
so
much
above
him
should
have
owned
that
she
was
all
his
own
seemed
then
to
be
world
enough
for
him
for
a
few
weeks
he
lived
a
hero
to
himself
and
was
able
to
tell
himself
that
for
him
the
glory
of
a
passion
was
sufficient
in
those
halcyon
moments
no
common
human
care
is
allowed
to
intrude
itself
to
one
who
has
thus
entered
in
upon
the
heroism
of
romance
his
own
daily
work
his
dinners
clothes
income
father
and
mother
sisters
and
brothers
his
own
street
and
house
are
nothing
hunting
shooting
rowing
even
speeches
in
parliament
if
they
perchance
have
been
attained
to
all
become
leather
or
prunella
the
heavens
have
been
opened
to
him
and
he
walks
among
them
like
a
god
so
it
had
been
with
tregear
then
had
come
the
second
phase
of
his
passion
which
is
also
not
uncommon
to
young
men
who
soar
high
in
their
first
assaults
he
was
told
that
it
would
not
do
and
was
not
so
told
by
a
parent
but
by
the
young
lady
herself
and
she
had
spoken
so
reasonably
that
he
had
yielded
and
had
walked
away
with
that
sudden
feeling
of
a
vile
return
to
his
own
mean
belongings
to
his
lodgings
and
his
income
which
not
a
few
ambitious
young
men
have
experienced
but
she
had
convinced
him
then
had
come
the
journey
to
italy
and
the
reader
knows
all
the
rest
he
certainly
had
not
derogated
in
transferring
his
affections
but
it
may
be
doubted
whether
in
his
second
love
he
had
walked
among
the
stars
as
in
the
first
a
man
can
hardly
mount
twice
among
the
stars
but
he
had
been
as
eager
and
as
true
and
he
had
succeeded
without
any
flaw
on
his
conscience
it
had
been
agreed
when
that
first
disruption
took
place
that
he
and
mabel
should
be
friends
and
as
to
a
friend
he
had
told
her
of
his
hopes
when
first
she
had
mingled
something
of
sarcasm
with
her
congratulations
though
it
had
annoyed
him
it
had
hardly
made
him
unhappy
when
she
called
him
romeo
and
spoke
of
herself
as
rosaline
he
took
her
remark
as
indicating
some
petulance
rather
than
an
enduring
love
that
had
been
womanly
and
he
could
forgive
it
he
had
his
other
great
and
solid
happiness
to
support
him
then
he
had
believed
that
she
would
soon
marry
if
not
silverbridge
then
some
other
fitting
young
nobleman
and
that
all
would
be
well
but
now
things
were
very
far
from
well
the
storm
which
was
now
howling
round
her
afflicted
him
much
perhaps
the
bitterest
feeling
of
all
was
that
her
love
should
have
been
so
much
stronger
so
much
more
enduring
than
his
own
he
could
not
but
remember
how
in
his
first
agony
he
had
blamed
her
because
she
had
declared
that
they
should
be
severed
he
had
then
told
himself
that
such
severing
would
be
to
him
impossible
and
that
had
her
nature
been
as
high
as
his
it
would
have
been
as
impossible
to
her
which
nature
must
he
now
regard
as
the
higher
she
had
done
her
best
to
rid
herself
of
the
load
of
her
passion
and
had
failed
but
he
had
freed
himself
with
convenient
haste
all
that
he
had
said
as
to
the
manliness
of
conquering
grief
had
been
wise
enough
but
still
he
could
not
quit
himself
of
some
feeling
of
disgrace
in
that
he
had
changed
and
she
had
not
he
tried
to
comfort
himself
with
reflecting
that
mary
was
all
his
own
that
in
that
matter
he
had
been
victorious
and
happy
but
for
an
hour
or
two
he
thought
more
of
mabel
than
of
mary
when
the
time
came
in
which
he
could
employ
himself
he
called
for
silverbridge
and
they
walked
together
across
the
park
to
westminster
silverbridge
was
gay
and
full
of
eagerness
as
to
the
coming
ministerial
statement
but
tregear
could
not
turn
his
mind
from
the
work
of
the
morning
i
do
seem
to
care
very
much
about
it
he
said
at
last
i
do
care
very
much
said
silverbridge
what
difference
will
it
make
i
breakfasted
with
the
governor
this
morning
and
i
have
not
seen
him
in
such
good
spirits
since
well
for
a
long
time
the
date
to
which
silverbridge
would
have
referred
had
he
not
checked
himself
was
that
of
the
evening
on
which
it
had
been
agreed
between
him
and
his
father
that
mabel
grex
should
be
promoted
to
the
seat
of
highest
honour
in
the
house
of
palliser
but
that
was
a
matter
which
must
henceforward
be
buried
in
silence
he
did
not
say
as
much
but
i
feel
perfectly
sure
that
he
and
monk
have
arranged
a
new
government
i
do
see
any
matter
for
joy
in
that
to
conservatives
like
you
and
me
he
is
my
father
and
as
he
is
going
to
be
your
i
should
have
thought
that
you
might
have
been
pleased
oh
yes
if
he
likes
it
but
i
have
heard
so
often
of
the
crushing
cares
of
office
and
i
had
thought
that
of
all
living
men
he
had
been
the
most
crushed
by
them
all
that
had
to
be
done
in
the
house
of
commons
on
that
afternoon
was
finished
before
five
by
five
the
house
and
all
the
purlieus
of
the
house
were
deserted
and
yet
at
four
immediately
after
prayers
there
had
been
such
a
crowd
that
members
had
been
unable
to
find
seats
tregear
and
silverbridge
having
been
early
had
succeeded
but
those
who
had
been
less
careful
were
obliged
to
listen
as
best
they
could
in
the
galleries
the
stretching
out
of
necks
and
the
holding
of
hands
behind
the
ears
did
not
last
long
sir
timothy
had
not
had
much
to
say
but
what
he
did
say
was
spoken
with
a
dignity
which
seemed
to
anticipate
future
exaltation
rather
than
present
downfall
there
had
arisen
a
question
in
regard
to
revenue
he
need
hardly
tell
them
that
it
was
that
question
in
reference
to
brewers
licences
to
which
the
honourable
gentleman
opposite
had
alluded
on
the
previous
day
as
to
which
unfortunately
he
was
not
in
accord
with
his
noble
friend
the
prime
minister
under
the
circumstances
it
was
hardly
possible
that
they
should
at
once
proceed
to
business
and
he
therefore
moved
that
the
house
should
stand
adjourned
till
tuesday
next
that
was
the
whole
statement
not
very
long
afterwards
the
prime
minister
made
another
statement
in
the
house
of
lords
as
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
had
very
suddenly
resigned
and
had
thereby
broken
up
the
ministry
he
had
found
himself
compelled
to
place
his
resignation
in
the
hands
of
her
majesty
then
that
house
was
also
adjourned
on
that
afternoon
all
the
clubs
were
alive
with
admiration
at
the
great
cleverness
displayed
by
sir
timothy
in
this
transaction
it
was
not
only
that
he
had
succeeded
in
breaking
up
the
ministry
and
that
he
had
done
this
without
incurring
violent
disgrace
but
he
had
so
done
it
as
to
throw
all
the
reproach
upon
his
late
unfortunate
colleague
it
was
thus
that
lupton
explained
it
sir
timothy
had
been
at
the
pains
to
ascertain
on
what
matters
connected
with
the
revenue
lord
drummond
or
lord
drummond
closest
advisers
had
opinions
of
their
own
opinions
strong
enough
not
to
be
abandoned
and
having
discovered
that
he
also
discovered
arguments
on
which
to
found
an
exactly
contrary
opinion
but
as
the
revenue
had
been
entrusted
specially
to
his
unworthy
hands
he
was
entitled
to
his
own
opinion
on
this
matter
the
majority
of
the
house
said
lupton
and
the
entire
public
will
no
doubt
give
him
credit
for
great
all
this
happened
on
the
friday
during
the
saturday
it
was
considered
probable
that
the
cabinet
would
come
to
terms
with
itself
and
that
internal
wounds
would
be
healed
the
general
opinion
was
that
lord
drummond
would
give
way
but
on
the
sunday
morning
it
was
understood
that
lord
drummond
would
not
yield
it
was
reported
that
lord
drummond
was
willing
to
purchase
his
separation
from
sir
timothy
even
at
the
expense
of
his
office
that
sir
timothy
should
give
way
seemed
to
be
impossible
had
he
done
so
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
recover
the
respect
of
the
house
then
it
was
rumoured
that
two
or
three
others
had
gone
with
sir
timothy
and
on
monday
morning
it
was
proclaimed
that
the
prime
minister
was
not
in
a
condition
to
withdraw
his
resignation
on
the
tuesday
the
house
met
and
monk
announced
still
from
the
opposition
benches
that
he
had
that
morning
been
with
the
queen
then
there
was
another
adjournment
and
all
the
liberals
knew
that
the
gates
of
paradise
were
again
about
to
be
opened
to
them
this
is
only
interesting
to
us
as
affecting
the
happiness
and
character
of
our
duke
he
had
consented
to
assist
monk
in
forming
a
government
and
to
take
office
under
monk
leadership
he
had
had
many
contests
with
himself
before
he
could
bring
himself
to
this
submission
he
knew
that
if
anything
could
once
again
make
him
contented
it
would
be
work
he
knew
that
if
he
could
serve
his
country
it
was
his
duty
to
serve
it
and
he
knew
also
that
it
was
only
by
the
adhesion
of
such
men
as
himself
that
the
traditions
of
his
party
could
be
maintained
but
he
had
been
prime
minister
and
he
was
sure
he
could
never
be
prime
minister
again
there
are
in
all
matters
certain
little
almost
hidden
signs
by
which
we
can
measure
within
our
own
bosoms
the
extent
of
our
successes
and
our
failures
our
duke
friends
had
told
him
that
his
ministry
had
been
serviceable
to
the
country
but
no
one
had
ever
suggested
to
him
that
he
would
again
be
asked
to
fill
the
place
which
he
had
filled
he
had
stopped
a
gap
he
would
beforehand
have
declared
himself
willing
to
serve
his
country
even
in
this
way
but
having
done
so
having
done
that
and
no
more
than
that
he
felt
that
he
had
failed
he
had
in
his
soreness
declared
to
himself
that
he
would
never
more
take
office
he
had
much
to
do
to
overcome
this
promise
to
himself
but
when
he
had
brought
himself
to
submit
he
was
certainly
a
happier
man
there
was
no
going
to
see
the
queen
that
on
the
present
occasion
was
done
simply
by
monk
but
on
the
wednesday
morning
his
name
appeared
in
the
list
of
the
new
cabinet
as
president
of
the
council
he
was
perhaps
a
little
fidgety
a
little
too
anxious
to
employ
himself
and
to
be
employed
a
little
too
desirous
of
immediate
work
but
still
he
was
happy
and
gracious
to
those
around
him
i
suppose
you
like
that
particular
office
silverbridge
said
to
him
well
yes
not
best
of
all
you
know
and
he
smiled
as
he
made
this
admission
you
mean
prime
minister
no
indeed
i
do
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
premier
should
always
sit
in
your
house
no
silverbridge
if
i
could
have
my
way
which
is
of
course
impossible
for
i
can
not
put
off
my
honours
i
would
return
to
my
old
place
i
would
return
to
the
exchequer
where
the
work
is
hard
and
certain
where
a
man
can
do
or
at
any
rate
attempt
to
do
some
special
thing
a
man
there
if
he
sticks
to
that
and
does
not
travel
beyond
it
need
not
be
popular
need
not
be
a
partisan
need
not
be
eloquent
need
not
be
a
courtier
he
should
understand
his
profession
as
should
a
lawyer
or
a
doctor
if
he
does
that
thoroughly
he
can
serve
his
country
without
recourse
to
that
parliamentary
strategy
for
which
i
know
that
i
am
unfit
you
ca
do
that
in
the
house
of
lords
sir
no
no
i
wish
the
title
could
have
passed
over
my
head
silverbridge
and
gone
to
you
at
once
i
think
we
both
should
have
been
suited
better
but
there
are
things
which
one
should
not
consider
even
in
this
place
i
may
perhaps
do
something
shall
you
attack
us
very
bitterly
i
am
the
only
man
who
does
not
mean
to
make
any
change
how
so
i
shall
stay
where
i
am
on
the
government
side
of
the
house
are
you
clear
about
that
my
boy
quite
clear
such
changes
should
not
be
made
without
very
much
consideration
i
have
already
written
to
them
at
silverbridge
and
have
had
three
or
four
answers
de
boung
says
that
the
borough
is
more
than
grateful
sprout
regrets
it
much
and
suggests
a
few
consideration
sprugeon
seems
to
think
it
does
not
signify
that
is
hardly
complimentary
no
not
to
me
but
he
is
very
civil
to
the
family
as
long
as
a
palliser
represents
the
borough
sprugeon
thinks
that
it
does
not
matter
much
on
which
side
he
may
sit
i
have
had
my
little
vagary
and
i
do
think
that
i
shall
change
again
i
suppose
it
is
your
republican
that
has
done

chapter
lxxix
the
first
wedding
as
easter
sunday
fell
on
the
april
and
as
the
arrangement
of
the
new
cabinet
with
its
inferior
offices
was
not
completed
till
the
of
that
month
there
was
only
just
time
for
the
new
elections
before
the
holidays
monk
sat
on
his
bench
so
comfortably
that
he
hardly
seemed
ever
to
have
been
off
it
and
phineas
finn
resumed
the
peculiar
ministerial
tone
of
voice
just
as
though
he
had
never
allowed
himself
to
use
the
free
and
indignant
strains
of
opposition
as
to
a
majority
nothing
as
yet
was
known
about
that
some
few
besides
silverbridge
might
probably
transfer
themselves
to
the
government
none
of
the
ministers
lost
their
seats
at
the
new
elections
the
opposite
party
seemed
for
a
while
to
have
been
paralysed
by
the
defection
of
sir
timothy
and
men
who
liked
a
quiet
life
were
able
to
comfort
themselves
with
the
reflection
that
nothing
could
be
done
this
session
for
our
lovers
this
was
convenient
neither
of
them
would
have
allowed
their
parliamentary
energies
to
have
interfered
at
such
a
crisis
with
his
domestic
affairs
but
still
it
was
well
to
have
time
at
command
the
day
for
the
marriage
of
isabel
and
silverbridge
had
been
now
fixed
that
was
to
take
place
on
the
wednesday
after
easter
and
was
to
be
celebrated
by
special
royal
favour
in
the
chapel
at
whitehall
all
the
pallisers
would
be
there
and
all
the
relations
of
all
the
pallisers
all
the
ambassadors
and
of
course
all
the
americans
in
london
it
would
be
a
wretched
grind
as
silverbridge
said
but
it
had
to
be
done
in
the
meantime
the
whole
party
including
the
new
president
of
the
council
were
down
at
matching
even
isabel
though
it
must
be
presumed
that
she
had
much
to
do
in
looking
after
her
bridal
garments
was
able
to
be
there
for
a
day
or
two
but
tregear
was
the
person
to
whom
this
visit
was
of
the
greatest
importance
he
had
been
allowed
to
see
lady
mary
in
london
but
hardly
to
do
more
than
see
her
with
her
he
had
been
alone
for
about
five
minutes
and
then
cruel
circumstances
circumstances
however
which
were
not
permanently
cruel
had
separated
them
all
their
great
difficulties
had
been
settled
and
no
doubt
they
were
happy
tregear
though
he
had
been
as
it
were
received
into
grace
by
that
glass
of
wine
still
had
not
entered
into
the
intimacies
of
the
house
this
he
felt
himself
he
had
been
told
that
he
had
better
restrain
himself
from
writing
to
mary
and
he
had
restrained
himself
he
had
therefore
no
immediate
opportunity
of
creeping
into
that
perfect
intimacy
with
the
house
and
household
which
is
generally
accorded
to
a
promised
on
this
occasion
he
travelled
down
alone
and
as
he
approached
the
house
he
who
was
not
by
nature
timid
felt
himself
to
be
somewhat
cowed
that
the
duke
should
not
be
cold
to
him
was
almost
impossible
of
course
he
was
there
in
opposition
to
the
duke
wishes
even
silverbridge
had
never
quite
liked
the
match
of
course
he
was
to
have
all
that
he
desired
of
course
he
was
the
most
fortunate
of
men
of
course
no
man
had
ever
stronger
reason
to
be
contented
with
the
girl
he
loved
but
still
his
heart
was
a
little
low
as
he
was
driven
up
to
the
door
the
first
person
whom
he
saw
was
the
duke
himself
who
as
the
fly
from
the
station
arrived
was
returning
from
his
walk
you
are
welcome
to
matching
he
said
taking
off
his
hat
with
something
of
ceremony
this
was
said
before
the
servants
but
tregear
was
then
led
into
the
study
and
the
door
was
closed
i
never
do
anything
by
halves
tregear
he
said
since
it
is
to
be
so
you
shall
be
the
same
to
me
as
though
you
had
come
under
other
auspices
of
yourself
personally
i
hear
all
that
is
good
consider
yourself
at
home
here
and
in
all
things
use
me
as
your
friend
tregear
endeavoured
to
make
some
reply
but
could
not
find
words
that
were
fitting
i
think
that
the
young
people
are
out
continued
the
duke
warburton
will
help
you
to
find
them
if
you
like
to
go
upon
the
search
the
words
had
been
very
gracious
but
still
there
was
something
in
the
manner
of
the
man
which
made
tregear
find
it
almost
impossible
to
regard
him
as
he
might
have
regarded
another
he
had
often
heard
the
duke
spoken
of
as
a
man
who
could
become
awful
if
he
pleased
almost
without
an
effort
he
had
been
told
of
the
man
mingled
simplicity
courtesy
and
against
which
no
impudence
or
raillery
could
prevail
and
now
he
seemed
to
understand
it
he
was
not
driven
to
go
under
the
private
secretary
escort
in
quest
of
the
young
people
mary
had
understood
her
business
much
better
than
that
if
you
please
sir
lady
mary
is
in
the
little
said
a
young
girl
to
him
as
soon
as
the
duke
door
was
closed
this
was
lady
mary
own
maid
who
had
been
on
the
for
the
fly
lady
mary
had
known
all
details
as
to
the
arrival
of
the
trains
and
the
length
of
the
journey
from
the
station
and
had
not
been
walking
with
the
other
young
people
when
the
duke
had
intercepted
her
lover
even
that
delay
she
had
thought
was
hard
the
discreet
maid
opened
the
door
of
the
little
and
discreetly
closed
it
instantly
at
last
she
said
throwing
herself
into
his
arms
yes
at
last
on
this
occasion
time
did
not
envy
them
the
long
afternoons
of
spring
had
come
and
as
tregear
had
reached
the
house
between
four
and
five
they
were
able
to
go
out
together
before
the
sun
set
no
she
said
when
he
came
to
inquire
as
to
her
life
during
the
last
twelve
months
you
had
not
much
to
be
afraid
of
as
to
my
forgetting
but
when
everything
was
against
me
one
thing
was
not
against
you
you
ought
to
have
been
sure
of
that
and
so
i
was
and
yet
i
felt
that
i
ought
not
to
have
been
sure
sometimes
in
my
solitude
i
used
to
think
that
i
myself
had
been
wrong
i
began
to
doubt
whether
under
any
circumstances
i
could
have
been
justified
in
asking
your
father
daughter
to
be
my
wife
because
of
his
rank
not
so
much
his
rank
as
his
money
ought
that
to
be
considered
a
poor
man
who
marries
a
rich
woman
will
always
be
suspected
because
people
are
so
mean
and
and
because
they
think
that
money
is
more
than
anything
else
it
should
be
nothing
at
all
in
such
matters
i
do
know
how
it
can
be
anything
they
have
been
saying
that
to
me
all
along
as
though
one
were
to
stop
to
think
whether
one
was
rich
or
poor
tregear
when
this
was
said
could
not
but
remember
that
at
a
time
not
very
much
prior
to
that
at
which
mary
had
not
stopped
to
think
neither
for
a
while
had
he
and
mabel
i
suppose
it
was
worse
for
me
than
for
you
she
added
i
hope
not
but
it
was
frank
and
therefore
i
ought
to
have
it
made
up
to
me
now
it
was
very
bad
to
be
alone
here
particularly
when
i
felt
that
papa
always
looked
at
me
as
though
i
were
a
sinner
he
did
not
mean
it
but
he
could
not
help
looking
at
me
like
that
and
there
was
nobody
to
whom
i
could
say
a
word
it
was
pretty
much
the
same
with
me
yes
but
you
were
not
offending
a
father
who
could
not
keep
himself
from
looking
reproaches
at
you
i
was
like
a
boy
at
school
who
had
been
put
into
coventry
and
then
they
sent
me
to
lady
cantrip
was
that
very
bad
i
do
believe
that
if
i
were
a
young
woman
with
a
mind
i
should
feel
myself
very
much
indebted
to
lady
cantrip
she
had
a
terrible
task
of
it
but
i
could
not
teach
myself
to
like
her
i
believe
she
knew
all
through
that
i
should
get
my
way
at
last
that
ought
to
have
made
you
friends
but
yet
she
tried
everything
she
could
and
when
i
told
her
about
that
meeting
up
at
lord
grex
she
was
so
shocked
do
you
remember
that
do
i
remember
it
were
not
you
shocked
this
question
was
not
to
be
answered
by
any
word
i
was
she
continued
it
was
an
awful
thing
to
do
but
i
was
determined
to
show
them
all
that
i
was
in
earnest
do
you
remember
how
miss
cassewary
looked
miss
cassewary
knew
all
about
it
i
daresay
she
did
and
so
i
suppose
did
mabel
grex
i
had
thought
that
perhaps
i
might
make
mabel
a
confidante
but
then
she
looked
up
into
his
face
but
what
you
like
mabel
do
you
not
i
do
i
like
her
very
very
much
perhaps
you
have
liked
her
too
well
for
that
eh
frank
too
well
for
what
that
she
should
have
heard
all
that
i
had
to
say
about
you
with
sympathy
if
so
i
am
so
sorry
you
need
not
fear
that
i
have
ever
for
a
moment
been
untrue
either
to
her
or
you
i
am
sure
you
have
not
to
me
poor
mabel
then
they
took
me
to
custins
that
was
worst
of
all
i
can
not
quite
tell
you
what
happened
there
of
course
he
asked
her
but
as
she
had
said
she
could
not
quite
tell
him
about
lord
popplecourt
the
next
morning
the
duke
asked
his
guest
in
a
playful
tone
what
was
his
christian
name
it
could
hardly
be
that
he
should
not
have
known
but
yet
he
asked
the
question
francis
oliphant
said
tregear
those
are
two
christian
names
i
suppose
but
what
do
they
call
you
at
home
frank
whispered
mary
who
was
with
them
then
i
will
call
you
frank
if
you
will
allow
me
the
use
of
christian
names
is
i
think
pleasant
and
hardly
common
enough
among
us
i
almost
forget
my
own
boy
name
because
the
practice
has
grown
up
of
calling
him
by
a
title
i
am
going
to
call
him

abraham
is
a
good
name
only
i
do
not
think
he
got
it
from
his
godfathers
and
godmothers
who
can
call
a
man
plantagenet
i
should
as
soon
think
of
calling
my
coeur
de
lion
so
he
is
said
mary
whereupon
the
duke
kissed
the
two
girls
and
went
his
way
showing
that
by
this
time
he
had
adopted
the
one
and
the
proposed
husband
of
the
other
into
his
heart
the
day
before
the
duke
started
for
london
to
be
present
at
the
grand
marriage
he
sent
for
frank
i
suppose
said
he
that
you
would
wish
that
some
time
should
be
fixed
for
your
own
marriage
to
this
the
accepted
suitor
of
course
assented
but
before
we
can
do
that
something
must
be
settled
about
money
tregear
when
he
heard
this
became
hot
all
over
and
felt
that
he
could
not
restrain
his
blushes
such
must
be
the
feeling
of
a
man
when
he
finds
himself
compelled
to
own
to
a
girl
father
that
he
intends
to
live
upon
her
money
and
not
upon
his
own
i
do
not
like
to
be
troublesome
continued
the
duke
or
to
ask
questions
which
might
seem
to
be
impertinent
oh
no
of
course
i
feel
my
position
i
can
only
say
that
it
was
not
because
your
daughter
might
probably
have
money
that
i
first
sought
her
love
it
shall
be
so
received
and
now
but
perhaps
it
will
be
best
that
you
should
arrange
all
this
with
my
man
of
business
moreton
shall
be
instructed
moreton
lives
near
my
place
in
barsetshire
but
is
now
in
london
if
you
will
call
on
him
he
shall
tell
you
what
i
would
suggest
i
hope
you
will
find
that
your
affairs
will
be
comfortable
and
now
as
to
the
time
isabel
wedding
was
declared
by
the
newspapers
to
have
been
one
of
the
most
brilliant
remembered
in
the
metropolis
there
were
six
bridesmaids
of
whom
of
course
mary
was
one
and
of
whom
poor
lady
mabel
grex
was
equally
of
course
not
another
poor
lady
mabel
was
at
this
time
with
miss
cassewary
at
grex
paying
what
she
believed
would
be
a
last
visit
to
the
old
family
home
among
the
others
were
two
american
girls
brought
into
that
august
society
for
the
sake
of
courtesy
rather
than
of
personal
love
and
there
were
two
other
palliser
girls
and
a
scotch
mccloskie
cousin
the
breakfast
was
of
course
given
by
boncassen
at
his
house
in
brook
street
where
the
bridal
presents
were
displayed
and
not
only
were
they
displayed
but
a
list
of
them
with
an
approximating
statement
as
to
their
value
appeared
in
one
or
two
of
the
next
day
newspapers
as
to
which
terrible
sin
against
good
taste
neither
was
or
boncassen
guilty
but
in
these
days
in
which
such
splendid
things
were
done
on
so
very
splendid
a
scale
a
young
lady
can
not
herself
lay
out
her
friends
gifts
so
as
to
be
properly
seen
by
her
friends
some
hand
is
needed
even
for
that
and
hence
comes
this
public
information
on
affairs
which
should
surely
be
private
in
our
grandmothers
time
the
happy
bride
happy
mother
herself
compounded
the
cake
or
at
any
rate
the
trusted
housekeeper
but
we
all
know
that
terrible
tower
of
silver
which
now
stands
with
its
appendages
of
flags
and
spears
on
the
modern
wedding
it
will
come
to
pass
with
some
of
us
soon
that
we
must
deny
ourselves
the
pleasure
of
having
young
friends
because
their
marriage
presents
are
so
costly
poor
boncassen
had
not
perhaps
a
happy
time
with
her
august
guests
on
that
morning
but
when
she
retired
to
give
isabel
her
last
kiss
in
privacy
she
did
feel
proud
to
think
that
her
daughter
would
some
day
be
an
english
duchess
chapter
lxxx
the
second
wedding
november
is
not
altogether
an
hymeneal
month
but
it
was
not
till
november
that
lady
mary
palliser
became
the
wife
of
frank
tregear
it
was
postponed
a
little
perhaps
in
order
that
the
silverbridges
as
they
were
now
called
might
be
present
the
silverbridges
who
were
now
quite
darby
and
joan
had
gone
to
the
states
when
the
session
had
been
brought
to
a
close
early
in
august
and
had
remained
there
nearly
three
months
isabel
had
taken
infinite
pleasure
in
showing
her
english
husband
to
her
american
friends
and
the
american
friends
had
no
doubt
taken
a
pride
in
seeing
so
glorious
a
british
husband
in
the
hands
of
an
american
wife
everything
was
new
to
silverbridge
and
he
was
happy
in
his
new
possession
she
too
enjoyed
it
infinitely
and
so
it
happened
that
they
had
been
unwilling
to
curtail
their
sojourn
but
in
november
they
had
to
return
because
mary
had
declared
that
her
marriage
should
be
postponed
till
it
could
be
graced
by
the
presence
of
her
elder
brother
the
marriage
of
silverbridge
had
been
august
there
had
been
a
manifest
intention
that
it
should
be
so
nobody
knew
with
whom
this
originated
boncassen
had
probably
been
told
that
it
ought
to
be
so
and
boncassen
had
been
willing
to
pay
the
bill
external
forces
had
perhaps
operated
the
duke
had
simply
been
passive
and
obedient
there
had
however
been
a
general
feeling
that
the
bride
of
the
heir
of
the
house
of
omnium
should
be
produced
to
the
world
amidst
a
blare
of
trumpets
and
a
glare
of
torches
so
it
had
been
but
both
the
duke
and
mary
were
determined
that
this
other
wedding
should
be
different
it
was
to
take
place
at
matching
and
none
would
be
present
but
they
who
were
staying
in
the
house
or
who
lived
around
such
as
tenants
and
dependants
four
clergymen
united
their
forces
to
tie
isabel
to
her
husband
one
of
whom
was
a
bishop
one
a
canon
and
the
two
others
royal
chaplains
but
there
was
only
to
be
the
vicar
of
the
parish
at
matching
and
indeed
there
were
no
guests
in
the
house
except
the
two
bridesmaids
and
and
finn
as
to
finn
mary
had
made
a
request
and
then
the
duke
had
suggested
that
the
husband
should
be
asked
to
accompany
his
wife
it
was
very
pretty
the
church
itself
is
pretty
standing
in
the
park
close
to
the
ruins
of
the
old
priory
not
above
three
hundred
yards
from
the
house
and
they
all
walked
taking
the
broad
pathway
through
the
ruins
going
under
that
figure
of
sir
guy
which
silverbridge
had
pointed
out
to
isabel
when
they
had
been
whispering
there
together
the
duke
led
the
way
with
his
girl
upon
his
arm
the
two
bridesmaids
followed
then
silverbridge
and
his
wife
with
phineas
and
his
wife
gerald
and
the
bridegroom
accompanied
them
belonging
as
it
were
to
the
same
party
it
was
very
rustic
almost
improper
this
is
altogether
wrong
you
know
said
gerald
you
should
appear
coming
from
some
other
part
of
the
world
as
if
you
were
almost
unexpected
you
ought
not
to
have
been
in
the
house
at
all
and
certainly
should
have
gone
under
some
disguise
there
had
been
rich
presents
too
on
this
occasion
but
they
were
shown
to
none
except
to
finn
and
the
bridesmaids
and
perhaps
to
the
favoured
servants
in
the
house
at
any
rate
there
was
nothing
said
of
them
in
the
newspapers
one
present
there
was
given
not
to
the
bride
but
to
the
bridegroom
which
he
showed
to
no
one
except
to
her
this
came
to
him
only
on
the
morning
of
his
marriage
and
the
envelope
containing
it
bore
the
postmark
of
sedbergh
he
knew
the
handwriting
well
before
he
opened
the
parcel
it
contained
a
small
with
his
crest
and
with
it
there
were
but
a
few
words
written
on
a
scrap
of
paper
i
pray
that
you
may
be
happy
this
was
to
have
been
given
to
you
long
ago
but
i
kept
it
back
because
of
that
decision
he
showed
the
ring
to
mary
and
told
her
it
had
come
from
lady
mabel
but
the
scrap
of
paper
no
one
saw
but
himself
perhaps
the
matter
most
remarkable
in
the
wedding
was
the
hilarity
of
the
duke
one
who
did
not
know
him
well
might
have
said
that
he
was
a
man
with
few
cares
and
who
now
took
special
joy
in
the
happiness
of
his
children
who
was
thoroughly
contented
to
see
them
marry
after
their
own
hearts
and
yet
as
he
stood
there
on
the
giving
his
daughter
to
that
new
son
and
looking
first
at
his
girl
and
then
at
his
married
son
he
was
reminding
himself
of
all
that
he
had
suffered
after
the
breakfast
which
was
by
no
means
a
grand
repast
and
at
which
the
cake
did
not
look
so
like
an
silver
castle
as
that
other
construction
had
done
the
happy
couple
were
sent
away
in
a
modest
chariot
to
the
railway
station
and
not
above
slippers
were
thrown
after
them
there
were
enough
for
luck
or
perhaps
there
might
have
been
luck
even
without
them
for
the
wife
thoroughly
respected
her
husband
as
did
the
husband
his
wife
finn
when
she
was
alone
with
phineas
said
a
word
or
two
about
frank
tregear
when
she
first
told
me
of
her
engagement
i
did
not
think
it
possible
that
she
should
marry
him
but
after
he
had
been
with
me
i
felt
sure
that
he
would
succeed
well
sir
said
silverbridge
to
the
duke
when
they
were
out
together
in
the
park
that
afternoon
what
do
you
think
about
him
i
think
he
is
a
manly
young
man
he
is
certainly
that
and
then
he
knows
things
and
understands
them
it
was
never
a
surprise
to
me
that
mary
should
have
been
so
fond
of
him
i
do
not
know
that
one
ought
to
be
surprised
at
anything
perhaps
what
surprised
me
most
was
that
he
should
have
looked
so
high
there
seemed
to
be
so
little
to
justify
it
but
now
i
will
accept
that
as
courage
which
i
before
regarded
as
arrogance
