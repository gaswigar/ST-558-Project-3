the
last
dream
of
bwona
khubla
from
steaming
lowlands
down
by
the
equator
where
monstrous
orchids
blow
where
beetles
big
as
mice
sit
on
the
and
fireflies
glide
about
by
night
like
little
moving
stars
the
travelers
went
three
days
through
forests
of
cactus
till
they
came
to
the
open
plains
where
the
oryx
are
and
glad
they
were
when
they
came
to
the
where
only
one
white
man
had
gone
before
which
the
natives
know
as
the
camp
of
bwona
khubla
and
found
the
water
there
it
lies
three
days
from
the
nearest
other
water
and
when
bwona
khubla
had
gone
there
three
years
ago
what
with
malaria
with
which
he
was
shaking
all
over
and
what
with
disgust
at
finding
the
dry
he
had
decided
to
die
there
and
in
that
part
of
the
world
such
decisions
are
always
fatal
in
any
case
he
was
overdue
to
die
but
hitherto
his
amazing
resolution
and
that
terrible
strength
of
character
that
so
astounded
his
porters
had
kept
him
alive
and
moved
his
safari
on
he
had
had
a
name
no
doubt
some
common
name
such
as
hangs
as
likely
as
not
over
scores
of
shops
in
london
but
that
had
gone
long
ago
and
nothing
identified
his
memory
now
to
distinguish
it
from
the
memories
of
all
the
other
dead
but
bwona
khubla
the
name
the
kikuyus
gave
him
there
is
not
doubt
that
he
was
a
fearful
man
a
man
that
was
dreaded
still
for
his
personal
force
when
his
arm
was
no
longer
able
to
lift
the
kiboko
when
all
his
men
knew
he
was
dying
and
to
this
day
though
he
is
dead
though
his
temper
was
embittered
by
malaria
and
the
equatorial
sun
nothing
impaired
his
will
which
remained
a
compulsive
force
to
the
very
last
impressing
itself
upon
all
and
after
the
last
from
what
the
kikuyus
say
the
country
must
have
had
powerful
laws
that
drove
bwona
khubla
out
whatever
country
it
was
on
the
morning
of
the
day
that
they
were
to
come
to
the
camp
of
bwona
khubla
all
the
porters
came
to
the
travelers
tents
asking
for
dow
dow
is
the
white
man
medicine
that
cures
all
evils
the
nastier
it
tastes
the
better
it
is
they
wanted
down
this
morning
to
keep
away
devils
for
they
were
near
the
place
where
bwona
khubla
died
the
travelers
gave
them
quinine
by
sunset
the
came
to
campini
bwona
khubla
and
found
water
there
had
they
not
found
water
many
of
them
must
have
died
yet
none
felt
any
gratitude
to
the
place
it
seemed
too
ominous
too
full
of
doom
too
much
harassed
almost
by
unseen
irresistible
things
and
all
the
natives
came
again
for
dow
as
soon
as
the
tents
were
pitched
to
protect
them
from
the
last
dreams
of
bwona
khubla
which
they
say
had
stayed
behind
when
the
last
safari
left
taking
bwona
khubla
body
back
to
the
edge
of
civilization
to
show
to
the
white
men
there
that
they
had
not
killed
him
for
the
white
men
might
not
know
that
they
durst
not
kill
bwona
khubla
and
the
travelers
gave
them
more
quinine
so
much
being
bad
for
the
nerves
and
that
night
by
the
there
was
no
pleasant
talk
all
talking
at
once
of
meat
they
had
eaten
and
cattle
that
each
one
owned
but
a
gloomy
silence
hung
by
every
fire
and
the
little
canvas
shelters
they
told
the
white
men
that
bwona
khubla
city
of
which
he
had
thought
at
the
last
and
where
the
natives
believed
he
was
once
a
king
of
which
he
had
raved
till
the
loneliness
rang
with
his
raving
had
settled
down
all
about
them
and
they
were
afraid
for
it
was
so
strange
a
city
and
wanted
more
dow
and
the
two
travelers
gave
them
more
quinine
for
they
saw
real
fear
in
their
faces
and
knew
they
might
run
away
and
leave
them
alone
in
that
place
that
they
too
had
come
to
fear
with
an
almost
equal
dread
though
they
knew
not
why
and
as
the
night
wore
on
their
feeling
of
boding
deepened
although
they
had
shared
three
bottles
or
so
of
champagne
that
they
meant
to
keep
for
days
when
they
killed
a
lion
this
is
the
story
that
each
of
those
two
men
tell
and
which
their
porters
corroborate
but
then
a
kikuyu
will
always
say
whatever
he
thinks
is
expected
of
him
the
travelers
were
both
in
bed
and
trying
to
sleep
but
not
able
to
do
so
because
of
an
ominous
feeling
that
mournfullest
of
all
the
cries
of
the
wild
the
hyæna
like
a
damned
soul
lamenting
strangely
enough
had
ceased
the
night
wore
on
to
the
hour
when
bwona
khubla
had
died
three
or
four
years
ago
dreaming
and
raving
of
his
city
and
in
the
hush
a
sound
softly
arose
like
a
wind
at
first
then
like
the
roar
of
beasts
then
unmistakably
the
sound
of
motors
motors
and
motor
busses
and
then
they
saw
clearly
and
unmistakably
they
say
in
that
lonely
desolation
where
the
equator
comes
up
out
of
the
forest
and
climbs
over
jagged
hills
they
say
they
saw
london
there
could
have
been
no
moon
that
night
but
they
say
there
was
a
multitude
of
stars
mists
had
come
rolling
up
at
evening
about
the
pinnacles
of
unexplored
red
peaks
that
clustered
round
the
camp
but
they
say
the
mist
must
have
cleared
later
on
at
any
rate
they
swear
they
could
see
london
see
it
and
hear
the
roar
of
it
both
say
they
saw
it
not
as
they
knew
it
at
all
not
debased
by
hundreds
of
thousands
of
lying
advertisements
but
transfigured
all
its
houses
magnificent
its
chimneys
rising
grandly
into
pinnacles
its
vast
squares
full
of
the
most
gorgeous
trees
transfigured
and
yet
london
its
windows
were
warm
and
happy
shining
at
night
the
lamps
in
their
long
rows
welcomed
you
the
were
gracious
jovial
places
yet
it
was
london
they
could
smell
the
smells
of
london
hear
london
songs
and
yet
it
was
never
the
london
that
they
knew
it
was
as
though
they
had
looked
on
some
strange
woman
face
with
the
eyes
of
her
lover
for
of
all
the
towns
of
the
earth
or
cities
of
song
of
all
the
spots
there
be
unhallowed
or
hallowed
it
seemed
to
those
two
men
then
that
the
city
they
saw
was
of
all
places
the
most
to
be
desired
by
far
they
say
a
barrel
organ
played
quite
near
them
they
say
a
coster
was
singing
they
admit
that
he
was
singing
out
of
tune
they
admit
a
cockney
accent
and
yet
they
say
that
that
song
had
in
it
something
that
no
earthly
song
had
ever
had
before
and
both
men
say
that
they
would
have
wept
but
that
there
was
a
feeling
about
their
heartstrings
that
was
far
too
deep
for
tears
they
believe
that
the
longing
of
this
masterful
man
that
was
able
to
rule
a
safari
by
raising
a
hand
had
been
so
strong
at
the
last
that
it
had
impressed
itself
deeply
upon
nature
and
had
caused
a
mirage
that
may
not
fade
wholly
away
perhaps
for
several
years
i
tried
to
establish
by
questions
the
truth
or
reverse
of
this
story
but
the
two
men
tempers
had
been
so
spoiled
by
africa
that
they
were
not
up
to
they
would
not
even
say
if
their
were
still
burning
they
say
that
they
saw
the
london
lights
all
round
them
from
eleven
till
midnight
they
could
hear
london
voices
and
the
sound
of
the
traffic
clearly
and
over
all
a
little
misty
perhaps
but
unmistakably
london
arose
the
great
metropolis
after
midnight
london
quivered
a
little
and
grew
more
indistinct
the
sound
of
the
traffic
began
to
dwindle
away
voices
seemed
farther
off
ceased
altogether
and
all
was
quiet
once
more
where
the
mirage
shimmered
and
faded
and
a
bull
rhinoceros
coming
down
through
the
stillness
snorted
and
watered
at
the
carlton
club
how
the
office
of
postman
fell
vacant
in
the
duties
of
postman
at
carried
amuel
sleggins
farther
afield
than
the
village
farther
afield
than
the
last
house
in
the
lane
right
up
to
the
big
bare
wold
and
the
house
where
no
one
went
no
one
that
is
but
the
three
grim
men
that
dwelt
there
and
the
secretive
wife
of
one
and
once
a
year
when
the
queer
green
letter
came
amuel
sleggins
the
postman
the
green
letter
always
came
just
as
the
leaves
were
turning
addressed
to
the
eldest
of
the
three
grim
men
with
a
wonderful
chinese
stamp
and
the
otford
and
amuel
sleggins
carried
it
up
to
the
house
he
was
not
afraid
to
go
for
he
always
took
the
letter
had
done
so
for
seven
years
yet
whenever
summer
began
to
draw
to
a
close
amuel
sleggins
was
ill
at
ease
and
if
there
was
a
touch
of
autumn
about
shivered
unduly
so
that
all
folk
wondered
and
then
one
day
a
wind
would
blow
from
the
east
and
the
wild
geese
would
appear
having
left
the
sea
flying
high
and
crying
strangely
and
pass
till
they
were
no
more
than
a
thin
black
line
in
the
sky
like
a
magical
stick
flung
up
by
a
doer
of
magic
twisting
and
twirling
away
and
the
leaves
would
turn
on
the
trees
and
the
mists
be
white
on
the
marshes
and
the
sun
set
large
and
red
and
autumn
would
step
down
quietly
that
night
from
the
wold
and
the
next
day
the
strange
green
letter
would
come
from
china
his
fear
of
the
three
grim
men
and
that
secretive
woman
and
their
lonely
secluded
house
or
else
the
cadaverous
cold
of
the
dying
season
rather
braced
amuel
when
the
time
was
come
and
he
would
step
out
bolder
upon
the
day
that
he
feared
than
he
had
perhaps
for
weeks
he
longed
on
that
day
for
a
letter
for
the
last
house
in
the
lane
there
he
would
dally
and
talk
awhile
and
look
on
faces
before
his
last
tramp
over
the
lonely
wold
to
end
at
the
dreaded
door
of
the
queer
grey
house
called
when
he
came
to
the
door
of
he
would
give
the
postman
knock
as
though
he
came
on
ordinary
rounds
to
a
house
of
every
day
although
no
path
led
up
to
it
although
the
skins
of
weasels
hung
thickly
from
upper
windows
and
scarcely
had
his
postman
knock
rung
through
the
dark
of
the
house
when
the
eldest
of
the
three
grim
men
would
always
run
to
the
door
o
what
a
face
had
he
there
was
more
slyness
in
it
than
ever
his
beard
could
hide
he
would
put
out
a
gristly
hand
and
into
it
amuel
sleggins
would
put
the
letter
from
china
and
rejoice
that
his
duty
was
done
and
would
turn
and
stride
away
and
the
fields
lit
up
before
him
but
ominous
eager
and
low
murmuring
arose
in
the
for
seven
years
this
was
so
and
no
harm
had
come
to
sleggins
seven
times
he
had
gone
to
and
as
often
come
safely
away
and
then
he
needs
must
marry
perhaps
because
she
was
young
perhaps
because
she
was
fair
or
because
she
had
shapely
ankles
as
she
came
one
day
through
the
marshes
among
the
milkmaid
flowers
shoeless
in
spring
less
things
than
these
have
brought
men
to
their
ends
and
been
the
nooses
with
which
fate
snared
them
running
with
marriage
curiosity
entered
his
house
and
one
day
as
they
walked
with
evening
through
the
meadows
one
summer
evening
she
asked
him
of
where
he
only
went
and
what
the
folks
were
like
that
no
one
else
had
seen
all
this
he
told
her
and
then
she
asked
him
of
the
green
letter
from
china
that
came
with
autumn
and
what
the
letter
contained
he
read
to
her
all
the
rules
of
the
inland
revenue
he
told
her
he
did
not
know
that
it
was
not
right
that
he
should
know
he
lectured
her
on
the
sin
of
inquisitiveness
he
quoted
parson
and
in
the
end
she
said
that
she
must
know
they
argued
concerning
this
for
many
days
days
of
the
ending
of
summer
of
shortening
evenings
and
as
they
argued
autumn
grew
nearer
and
nearer
and
the
green
letter
from
china
and
at
last
he
promised
that
when
the
green
letter
came
he
would
take
it
as
usual
to
the
lonely
house
and
then
hide
somewhere
near
and
creep
to
the
window
at
nightfall
and
hear
what
the
grim
folk
said
perhaps
they
might
read
aloud
the
letter
from
china
and
before
he
had
time
to
repent
of
that
promise
a
cold
wind
came
one
night
and
the
woods
turned
golden
the
plover
went
in
bands
at
evening
over
the
marshes
the
year
had
turned
and
there
came
the
letter
from
china
never
before
had
amuel
felt
such
misgivings
as
he
went
his
postman
rounds
never
before
had
he
so
much
feared
the
day
that
took
him
up
to
the
wold
and
the
lonely
house
while
snug
by
the
fire
his
wife
looked
pleasurably
forward
to
curiosity
gratification
and
hoped
to
have
news
ere
nightfall
that
all
the
gossips
of
the
village
would
envy
one
consolation
only
had
amuel
as
he
set
out
with
a
shiver
there
was
a
letter
that
day
for
the
last
house
in
the
lane
long
did
he
tarry
there
to
look
at
their
cheery
faces
to
hear
the
sound
of
their
laughter
you
did
not
hear
laughter
in
and
when
the
last
topic
had
been
utterly
talked
out
and
no
excuse
for
lingering
remained
he
heaved
a
heavy
sigh
and
plodded
grimly
away
and
so
came
late
to
he
gave
his
postman
knock
on
the
shut
oak
door
heard
it
reverberate
through
the
silent
house
saw
the
grim
elder
man
and
his
gristly
hand
gave
up
the
green
letter
from
china
and
strode
away
there
is
a
clump
of
trees
growing
all
alone
in
the
wold
desolate
mournful
by
day
by
night
full
of
ill
omen
far
off
from
all
other
trees
as
from
other
houses
near
it
stands
not
today
did
amuel
stride
briskly
on
with
all
the
new
winds
of
autumn
blowing
cheerily
past
him
till
he
saw
the
village
before
him
and
broke
into
song
but
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
sight
of
the
house
he
turned
and
stooping
behind
a
fold
of
the
ground
ran
back
to
the
desolate
wood
there
he
waited
watching
the
evil
house
just
too
far
to
hear
voices
the
sun
was
low
already
he
chose
the
window
at
which
he
meant
to
eavesdrop
a
little
barred
one
at
the
back
close
to
the
ground
and
then
the
pigeons
came
in
for
a
great
distance
there
was
no
other
wood
so
numbers
shelter
there
though
the
clump
is
small
and
of
so
evil
a
look
if
they
notice
that
the
first
one
frightened
amuel
he
felt
that
it
might
be
a
spirit
escaped
from
torture
in
some
dim
parlour
of
the
house
that
he
watched
his
nerves
were
strained
and
he
feared
foolish
fears
then
he
grew
used
to
them
and
the
sun
set
then
and
the
aspect
of
everything
altered
and
he
felt
strange
fears
again
behind
him
was
a
hollow
in
the
wold
he
watched
it
darkening
and
before
him
he
saw
the
house
through
the
trunks
of
the
trees
he
waited
for
them
to
light
their
lamps
so
that
they
could
not
see
when
he
would
steal
up
softly
and
crouch
by
the
little
back
window
but
though
every
bird
was
home
though
the
night
grew
chilly
as
tombs
though
a
star
was
out
still
there
shone
no
yellow
light
from
any
window
amuel
waited
and
shuddered
he
did
not
dare
to
move
till
they
lit
their
lamps
they
might
be
watching
the
damp
and
the
cold
so
strangely
affected
him
that
autumn
evening
and
the
remnants
of
sunset
the
stars
and
the
wold
and
the
whole
vault
of
the
sky
seemed
like
a
hall
that
they
had
prepared
for
fear
he
began
to
feel
a
dread
of
prodigious
things
and
still
no
light
shone
in
the
evil
house
it
grew
so
dark
that
he
decided
to
move
and
make
his
way
to
the
window
in
spite
of
the
stillness
and
though
the
house
was
dark
he
rose
and
while
standing
arrested
by
pains
that
cramped
his
limbs
he
heard
the
door
swing
open
on
the
far
side
of
the
house
he
had
just
time
to
hide
behind
the
trunk
of
a
pine
when
the
three
grim
men
approached
him
and
the
woman
hobbled
behind
right
to
the
ominous
clump
of
trees
they
came
as
though
they
loved
their
blackness
passed
through
within
a
yard
or
two
of
the
postman
and
squatted
down
on
their
haunches
in
a
ring
in
the
hollow
behind
the
trees
they
lit
a
fire
in
the
hollow
and
laid
a
kid
on
the
fire
and
by
the
light
of
it
amuel
saw
brought
forth
from
an
untanned
pouch
the
letter
that
came
from
china
the
elder
opened
it
with
his
gristly
hand
and
intoning
words
that
amuel
did
not
know
drew
out
from
it
a
green
powder
and
sprinkled
it
on
the
fire
at
once
a
flame
arose
and
a
wonderful
savour
the
flames
rose
higher
and
flickered
turning
the
trees
all
green
and
amuel
saw
the
gods
coming
to
snuff
the
savour
while
the
three
grim
men
prostrated
themselves
by
their
fire
and
the
horrible
woman
that
was
the
spouse
of
one
he
saw
the
gods
coming
gauntly
over
the
wold
beheld
the
gods
of
old
england
hungrily
snuffing
the
savour
odin
balder
and
thor
the
gods
of
the
ancient
people
beheld
them
eye
to
eye
clear
and
close
in
the
twilight
and
the
office
of
postman
fell
vacant
in
the
prayer
of
boob
aheera
in
the
harbour
between
the
liner
and
the
palms
as
the
huge
passengers
came
up
from
dinner
at
moonrise
each
in
his
canoe
ali
kareeb
ahash
and
boob
aheera
passed
within
knife
thrust
so
urgent
was
the
purpose
of
ali
kareeb
ahash
that
he
did
not
lean
over
as
his
enemy
slid
by
did
not
tarry
then
to
settle
that
long
account
but
that
boob
aheera
made
no
attempt
to
reach
him
was
a
source
of
wonder
to
ali
he
pondered
it
till
the
liner
electric
lights
shone
far
away
behind
him
with
one
blaze
and
the
canoe
was
near
to
his
destination
and
pondered
it
in
vain
for
all
that
the
eastern
subtlety
of
his
mind
was
able
to
tell
him
clearly
was
that
it
was
not
like
boob
aheera
to
pass
him
like
that
that
boob
aheera
could
have
dared
to
lay
such
a
cause
as
his
before
the
diamond
idol
ali
had
not
conceived
yet
as
he
drew
near
to
the
golden
shrine
in
the
palms
that
none
that
come
by
the
great
ships
ever
found
he
began
to
see
more
clearly
in
his
mind
that
this
was
where
boob
had
gone
on
that
hot
night
and
when
he
beached
his
canoe
his
fears
departed
giving
place
to
the
resignation
with
which
he
always
viewed
destiny
for
there
on
the
white
sea
sand
were
the
tracks
of
another
canoe
the
edges
all
fresh
and
ragged
boob
aheera
had
been
before
him
ali
did
not
blame
himself
for
being
late
the
thing
had
been
planned
before
the
beginning
of
time
by
gods
that
knew
their
business
only
his
hate
of
boob
aheera
increased
his
enemy
against
whom
he
had
come
to
pray
and
the
more
his
hate
increased
the
more
clearly
he
saw
him
until
nothing
else
could
be
seen
by
the
eye
of
his
mind
but
the
dark
lean
figure
the
little
lean
legs
the
grey
beard
and
neat
of
boob
aheera
his
enemy
that
the
diamond
idol
should
have
granted
the
prayers
of
such
a
one
he
did
not
as
yet
imagine
he
hated
him
merely
for
his
presumptuousness
in
approaching
the
shrine
at
all
for
approaching
it
before
him
whose
cause
was
righteous
for
many
an
old
past
wrong
but
most
of
all
for
the
expression
of
his
face
and
the
general
look
of
the
man
as
he
has
swept
by
in
his
canoe
with
his
double
paddle
going
in
the
moonlight
ali
pushed
through
the
steaming
vegetation
the
place
smelt
of
orchids
there
is
no
track
to
the
shrine
though
many
go
if
there
were
a
track
the
white
man
would
one
day
find
it
and
parties
would
row
to
see
it
whenever
a
liner
came
in
and
photographs
would
appear
in
weekly
papers
with
accounts
of
it
underneath
by
men
who
had
never
left
london
and
all
the
mystery
would
be
gone
away
and
there
would
be
nothing
novel
in
this
story
ali
had
scarcely
gone
a
hundred
yards
through
cactus
and
creeper
underneath
the
palms
when
he
came
to
the
golden
shrine
that
nothing
guards
except
the
deeps
of
the
forest
and
found
the
diamond
idol
the
diamond
idol
is
five
inches
high
and
its
base
a
good
inch
square
and
it
has
a
greater
lustre
than
those
diamonds
that
moses
bought
last
year
for
his
wife
when
he
offered
her
an
earldom
or
the
diamonds
and
jael
his
wife
had
answered
buy
the
diamonds
and
be
just
plain
mr
fortescue
purer
than
those
was
its
luster
and
carved
as
they
carve
not
in
europe
and
the
men
thereby
are
poor
and
held
to
be
fearless
yet
they
do
not
sell
that
idol
and
i
may
say
here
that
if
any
one
of
my
readers
should
ever
come
by
ship
to
the
winding
harbour
where
the
forts
of
the
portuguese
crumble
in
infinite
greenery
where
the
baobab
stands
like
a
corpse
here
and
there
in
the
palms
if
he
goes
ashore
where
no
one
has
any
business
to
go
and
where
no
one
so
far
as
i
know
has
gone
from
a
liner
before
though
it
little
more
than
a
mile
or
so
from
the
pier
and
if
he
finds
a
golden
shrine
which
is
near
enough
to
the
shore
and
a
diamond
in
it
carved
in
the
shape
of
a
god
it
is
better
to
leave
it
alone
and
get
back
safe
to
the
ship
than
to
sell
that
diamond
idol
for
any
price
in
the
world
ali
kareeb
ahash
went
into
the
golden
shrine
and
when
he
raised
his
head
from
the
seven
obeisances
that
are
the
due
of
the
idol
behold
it
glowed
with
such
a
lustre
as
only
it
wears
after
answering
recent
prayer
no
native
of
those
parts
mistakes
the
tone
of
the
idol
they
know
its
varying
shades
as
a
tracker
knows
blood
the
moon
was
streaming
in
through
the
open
door
and
ali
saw
it
clearly
no
one
had
been
that
night
but
boob
aheera
the
fury
of
ali
rose
and
surged
to
his
heart
he
clutched
his
knife
till
the
hilt
of
it
bruised
his
hand
yet
he
did
not
utter
the
prayer
that
he
had
made
ready
about
boob
aheera
liver
for
he
saw
that
boob
aheera
prayers
were
acceptable
to
the
idol
and
knew
that
divine
protection
was
over
his
enemy
what
boob
aheera
prayer
was
he
did
not
know
but
he
went
back
to
the
beach
as
fast
as
one
can
go
through
cacti
and
creepers
that
climb
to
the
tops
of
the
palms
and
as
fast
as
his
canoe
could
carry
him
he
went
down
the
winding
harbour
till
the
liner
shone
beside
him
as
he
passed
and
he
heard
the
sound
of
its
band
rise
up
and
die
and
he
landed
and
came
that
night
into
boob
aheera
hut
and
there
he
offered
himself
as
his
enemy
slave
and
boob
aheera
slave
he
is
to
this
day
and
his
master
has
protection
from
the
idol
and
ali
rows
to
the
liners
and
goes
on
board
to
sell
rubies
made
of
glass
and
thin
suits
for
the
tropics
and
ivory
napkin
rings
and
manchester
kimonos
and
little
lovely
shells
and
the
passengers
abuse
him
because
of
his
prices
and
yet
they
should
not
for
all
the
money
cheated
by
ali
kareeb
ahash
goes
to
boob
aheera
his
master
east
and
west
it
was
dead
of
night
and
midwinter
a
frightful
wind
was
bringing
sleet
from
the
east
the
long
sere
grasses
were
wailing
two
specks
of
light
appeared
on
the
desolate
plain
a
man
in
a
hansom
cab
was
driving
alone
in
north
china
alone
with
the
driver
and
the
dejected
horse
the
driver
wore
a
good
waterproof
cape
and
of
course
an
oiled
silk
hat
but
the
man
in
the
cab
wore
nothing
but
evening
dress
he
did
not
have
the
glass
door
down
because
the
horse
fell
so
frequently
the
sleet
had
put
his
cigar
out
and
it
was
too
cold
to
sleep
the
two
lamps
flared
in
the
wind
by
the
uncertain
light
of
a
candle
lamp
that
flickered
inside
the
cab
a
manchu
shepherd
that
saw
the
vehicle
pass
where
he
watched
his
sheep
on
the
plain
in
fear
of
the
wolves
for
the
first
time
saw
evening
dress
and
though
he
saw
if
dimly
and
what
he
saw
was
wet
it
was
like
a
backward
glance
of
a
thousand
years
for
as
his
civilization
is
so
much
older
than
ours
they
have
presumably
passed
through
all
that
kind
of
thing
he
watched
it
stoically
not
wondering
at
a
new
thing
if
indeed
it
be
new
to
china
meditated
on
it
awhile
in
a
manner
strange
to
us
and
when
he
had
added
to
his
philosophy
what
little
could
be
derived
from
the
sight
of
this
hansom
cab
returned
to
his
contemplation
of
that
night
chances
of
wolves
and
to
such
occasional
thoughts
as
he
drew
at
times
for
his
comfort
out
of
the
legends
of
china
that
have
been
preserved
for
such
uses
and
on
such
a
night
their
comfort
was
greatly
needed
he
thought
of
the
legend
of
a
more
fair
than
the
flowers
are
without
an
equal
amongst
daughters
of
men
humanly
lovely
to
look
on
although
her
sire
was
a
dragon
yet
one
who
traced
his
descent
from
gods
of
the
elder
days
and
so
it
was
that
she
went
in
all
her
ways
divine
like
the
earliest
ones
of
her
race
who
were
holier
than
the
emperor
she
had
come
down
one
day
out
of
her
little
land
a
grassy
valley
hidden
amongst
the
mountains
by
the
way
of
the
mountain
passes
she
came
down
and
the
rocks
of
the
rugged
pass
rang
like
little
bells
about
her
as
her
bare
feet
went
by
like
silver
bells
to
please
her
and
the
sound
was
like
the
sound
of
the
dromedaries
of
a
prince
when
they
come
home
at
evening
their
silver
bells
are
ringing
and
the
are
glad
she
had
come
down
to
pick
the
enchanted
poppy
that
grew
and
grows
to
this
day
if
only
men
might
find
it
in
a
field
at
the
feet
of
the
mountains
if
one
should
pick
it
happiness
would
come
to
all
yellow
men
victory
without
fighting
good
wages
and
ceaseless
ease
she
came
down
all
fair
from
the
mountains
and
as
the
legend
pleasantly
passed
through
his
mind
in
the
bitterest
hour
of
the
night
which
comes
before
dawn
two
lights
appeared
and
another
hansom
went
by
the
man
in
the
second
cab
was
dressed
the
same
as
the
first
he
was
wetter
than
the
first
for
the
sleet
had
fallen
all
night
but
evening
dress
is
evening
dress
all
the
world
over
the
driver
wore
the
same
oiled
hat
the
same
waterproof
cape
as
the
other
and
when
the
cab
had
passed
the
darkness
swirled
back
where
the
two
small
lamps
had
been
and
the
slush
poured
into
the
and
nothing
remained
but
the
speculations
of
the
shepherd
to
tell
that
a
hansom
cab
had
been
in
that
part
of
china
presently
even
these
ceased
and
he
was
back
with
the
early
legends
again
in
contemplation
of
serener
things
and
the
storm
and
the
cold
and
the
darkness
made
one
last
effort
and
shook
the
bones
of
that
shepherd
and
rattled
the
teeth
in
the
head
that
mused
on
the
flowery
fables
and
suddenly
it
was
morning
you
saw
the
outlines
of
the
sheep
all
of
a
sudden
the
shepherd
counted
them
no
wolf
had
come
you
could
see
them
all
quite
clearly
and
in
the
pale
light
of
the
earliest
morning
the
third
hansom
appeared
with
its
lamps
still
burning
looking
ridiculous
in
the
daylight
they
came
out
of
the
east
with
the
sleet
and
were
all
going
due
westwards
and
the
occupant
of
the
third
cab
also
wore
evening
dress
calmly
that
manchu
shepherd
without
curiosity
still
less
with
wonder
but
as
one
who
would
see
whatever
life
has
to
show
him
stood
for
four
hours
to
see
if
another
would
come
the
sleet
and
the
east
wind
continued
and
at
the
end
of
four
hours
another
came
the
driver
was
urging
it
on
as
fast
as
he
could
as
though
he
were
making
the
most
of
the
daylight
his
cabby
cape
was
flapping
wildly
about
him
inside
the
cab
a
man
in
evening
dress
was
being
jolted
up
and
down
by
the
unevenness
of
the
plain
this
was
of
course
that
famous
race
from
pittsburg
to
piccadilly
going
round
by
the
long
way
that
started
one
night
after
dinner
from
flagdrop
house
and
was
won
by
kagg
driving
the
honourable
alfred
fortescue
whose
father
it
will
be
remembered
was
hagar
dermstein
and
became
by
letters
patent
sir
edgar
fortescue
and
finally
lord
george
the
manchu
shepherd
stood
there
till
evening
and
when
he
saw
that
no
more
cabs
would
come
turned
homeward
in
search
of
food
and
the
rice
prepared
for
him
was
hot
and
good
all
the
more
after
the
bitter
coldness
of
that
sleet
and
when
he
had
consumed
it
her
perused
his
experience
turning
over
again
in
his
mind
each
detail
of
the
cabs
he
had
seen
and
from
that
his
thoughts
slipped
calmly
to
the
glorious
history
of
china
going
back
to
the
indecorous
times
before
calmness
came
and
beyond
those
times
to
the
happy
days
of
the
earth
when
the
gods
and
dragons
were
here
and
china
was
young
and
lighting
his
opium
pipe
and
casting
his
thoughts
easily
forward
he
looked
to
the
time
when
the
dragons
shall
come
again
and
for
a
long
while
then
his
mind
reposed
itself
in
such
a
dignified
calm
that
no
thought
stirred
there
at
all
from
which
when
he
was
aroused
he
cast
off
his
lethargy
as
a
man
emerges
from
the
baths
refreshed
cleansed
and
contented
and
put
away
from
his
musings
the
things
he
had
seen
on
the
plain
as
being
evil
and
of
the
nature
of
dreams
or
futile
illusion
the
results
of
activity
which
troubleth
calm
and
then
he
turned
his
mind
toward
the
shape
of
god
the
one
the
ineffable
who
sits
by
the
lotus
lily
whose
shape
is
the
shape
of
peace
and
denieth
activity
and
went
out
his
thanks
to
him
that
he
had
cast
all
bad
customs
westward
out
of
china
as
a
woman
throws
household
dirt
out
of
her
basket
far
out
into
neighbouring
gardens
from
thankfulness
he
turned
to
calm
again
and
out
of
calm
to
sleep
a
pretty
quarrel
on
one
of
those
unattained
and
unattainable
pinnacles
that
are
known
as
the
bleaks
of
eerie
an
eagle
was
looking
east
with
a
hopeful
presage
of
blood
for
he
knew
and
rejoiced
in
the
knowledge
that
eastward
over
the
dells
the
dwarfs
were
risen
in
ulk
and
gone
to
war
with
the
the
are
they
that
were
born
of
earthly
women
but
their
sires
are
the
elder
gods
who
walked
of
old
among
men
disguised
they
would
go
through
the
villages
sometimes
in
summer
evenings
cloaked
and
unknown
of
men
but
the
younger
maidens
knew
them
and
always
ran
to
them
singing
for
all
that
their
elders
said
in
evenings
long
ago
they
had
danced
to
the
woods
of
the
their
children
dwelt
beyond
the
dells
of
the
bracken
in
the
cool
and
heathery
lands
and
were
now
at
war
with
the
dwarfs
dour
and
grim
were
the
and
had
the
faults
of
both
parents
and
would
not
mix
with
men
but
claimed
the
right
of
their
fathers
and
would
not
play
human
games
but
forever
were
prophesying
and
yet
were
more
frivolous
than
their
mothers
were
whom
the
fairies
had
long
since
buried
in
wild
wood
gardens
with
more
than
human
rites
and
being
irked
at
their
lack
of
rights
and
ill
content
with
the
land
and
having
no
power
at
all
over
the
wind
and
snow
and
caring
little
for
the
powers
they
had
the
became
idle
greasy
and
slow
and
the
contemptuous
dwarfs
despised
them
ever
the
dwarfs
were
contemptuous
of
all
things
savouring
of
heaven
and
of
everything
that
was
even
partly
divine
they
were
so
it
has
been
said
of
the
seed
of
man
but
being
squat
and
hairy
like
to
the
beasts
they
praised
all
beastly
things
and
bestiality
was
shown
reverence
among
them
so
far
as
reverence
was
theirs
to
show
so
most
of
all
they
despised
the
discontent
of
the
who
dreamed
of
the
courts
of
heaven
and
power
over
wind
and
snow
for
what
better
said
the
dwarfs
could
do
than
nose
in
the
earth
for
roots
and
cover
their
faces
with
mire
and
run
with
the
cheerful
goats
and
be
even
as
they
now
in
their
idleness
caused
by
their
discontent
the
seed
of
the
gods
and
the
maidens
grew
more
discontented
still
and
only
spake
of
or
cared
for
heavenly
things
until
the
contempt
of
the
dwarfs
who
heard
of
all
these
doings
was
bridled
no
longer
and
it
must
needs
be
war
they
burned
spice
dipped
in
blood
and
dried
before
the
chief
of
their
witches
sharpening
their
axes
and
made
war
on
the
they
passed
by
night
over
the
oolnar
mountains
each
dwarf
with
his
good
axe
the
old
flint
of
his
fathers
a
night
when
no
moon
shone
and
they
went
unshod
and
swiftly
to
come
on
the
in
the
darkness
beyond
the
dells
of
ulk
lying
fat
and
idle
and
contemptible
and
before
it
was
light
they
found
the
heathery
lands
and
the
lying
lazy
all
over
the
side
of
a
hill
the
dwarfs
stole
towards
them
warily
in
the
darkness
now
the
art
that
the
gods
love
most
is
the
art
of
war
and
when
the
seed
of
the
gods
and
those
nimble
maidens
awoke
and
found
it
was
war
it
was
almost
as
much
to
them
as
the
godlike
pursuits
of
heaven
enjoyed
in
the
marble
courts
or
power
over
wind
and
snow
they
all
drew
out
at
once
their
swords
of
tempered
bronze
cast
down
to
them
centuries
since
on
stormy
nights
when
their
fathers
drew
them
and
faced
the
dwarfs
and
casting
their
idleness
from
them
fell
on
them
sword
to
axe
and
the
dwarfs
fought
hard
that
night
and
bruised
the
sorely
hacking
with
those
huge
axes
that
had
not
spared
the
oaks
yet
for
all
the
weight
of
their
blows
and
the
cunning
of
their
adventure
one
point
they
had
overlooked
were
as
the
fight
rolled
on
towards
morning
the
fighters
were
fewer
and
fewer
yet
for
all
the
blows
of
the
dwarfs
men
fell
upon
one
side
only
dawn
came
and
the
were
fighting
against
no
more
than
six
and
the
hour
that
follows
dawn
and
the
last
of
the
dwarfs
was
gone
and
when
the
light
was
clear
on
that
peak
of
the
bleaks
of
eerie
the
eagle
left
his
crag
and
flew
grimly
east
and
found
it
was
as
he
had
hoped
in
the
matter
of
blood
but
the
lay
down
in
their
heathery
lands
for
once
content
though
so
far
from
the
courts
of
heaven
and
even
half
forgot
their
heavenly
rights
and
sighed
no
more
for
power
over
wind
and
snow
how
the
gods
avenged
meoul
ki
ning
meoul
ki
ning
was
on
his
way
with
a
lily
from
the
lotus
ponds
of
esh
to
offer
it
to
the
goddess
of
abundance
in
her
temple
aoul
keroon
and
on
the
road
from
the
pond
to
the
little
hill
and
the
temple
aoul
keroon
ap
ariph
his
enemy
shot
him
with
an
arrow
from
a
bow
that
he
had
made
out
of
bamboo
and
took
his
pretty
lily
up
the
hill
and
offered
it
to
the
goddess
of
abundance
in
her
temple
aoul
keroon
and
the
goddess
was
pleased
with
the
gift
as
all
women
are
and
sent
pleasant
dreams
to
ap
ariph
for
seven
nights
straight
from
the
moon
and
on
the
seventh
night
the
gods
held
conclave
together
on
the
cloudy
peaks
they
held
it
above
narn
ktoon
and
pti
so
high
their
peak
arises
that
no
man
heard
their
voices
they
spake
on
that
cloudy
mountain
not
the
highest
hamlet
heard
them
what
doth
the
goddess
of
abundance
but
naming
her
lling
as
they
name
her
what
doth
she
sending
sweet
dreams
for
seven
nights
to
ap
ariph
and
the
gods
sent
for
their
seer
who
is
all
eyes
and
feet
running
to
and
fro
on
the
earth
observing
the
ways
of
men
seeing
even
their
littlest
doings
never
deeming
a
doing
too
little
but
knowing
the
web
of
the
gods
is
woven
of
littlest
things
he
it
is
that
sees
the
cat
in
the
garden
of
parakeets
the
thief
in
the
upper
chamber
the
sin
of
the
child
with
the
honey
the
women
talking
indoors
and
the
small
hut
innermost
things
standing
before
the
gods
he
told
them
the
case
of
ap
ariph
and
the
wrongs
of
meoul
ki
ning
and
the
rape
of
the
lotus
lily
he
told
of
the
cutting
and
making
of
ap
ariph
bamboo
bow
of
the
shooting
of
meoul
ki
ning
and
of
how
the
arrow
hit
him
and
the
smile
on
the
face
of
lling
when
she
came
by
the
lotus
bloom
and
the
gods
were
wroth
with
ap
ariph
and
swore
to
avenge
ki
ning
and
the
ancient
one
of
the
gods
he
that
is
older
than
earth
called
up
the
thunder
at
once
and
raised
his
arms
and
cried
out
on
the
high
windy
mountain
and
prophesied
on
those
rocks
with
runes
that
were
older
than
speech
and
sang
in
his
wrath
old
songs
that
he
had
learned
in
storm
from
the
sea
when
only
that
peak
of
the
gods
in
the
whole
of
the
earth
was
dry
and
he
swore
that
ap
ariph
should
die
that
night
and
the
thunder
raged
about
him
and
the
tears
of
lling
were
vain
the
lightning
stroke
of
the
gods
leaping
earthward
seeking
ap
ariph
passed
near
to
his
house
but
missed
him
a
certain
vagabond
was
down
from
the
hills
singing
songs
in
the
street
near
by
the
house
of
ap
ariph
songs
of
a
former
folk
that
dwelt
once
they
say
in
those
valleys
and
begging
for
rice
and
curds
it
was
him
the
lightning
hit
and
the
gods
were
satisfied
and
their
wrath
abated
and
their
thunder
rolled
away
and
the
great
black
clouds
dissolved
and
the
ancient
one
of
the
gods
went
back
to
his
sleep
and
morning
came
and
the
birds
and
the
light
shone
on
the
mountain
and
the
peak
stood
clear
to
see
the
serene
home
of
the
gods
the
gift
of
the
gods
there
was
once
a
man
who
sought
a
boon
of
the
gods
for
peace
was
over
the
world
and
all
things
savoured
of
sameness
and
the
man
was
weary
at
heart
and
sighed
for
the
tents
and
the
warfields
therefore
he
sought
a
boon
of
the
ancient
gods
and
appearing
before
them
he
said
to
them
ancient
gods
there
is
peace
in
the
land
where
i
dwell
and
indeed
to
the
uttermost
parts
and
we
are
full
weary
of
peace
o
ancient
gods
grant
us
war
and
the
ancient
gods
made
him
a
war
and
the
man
went
forth
with
his
sword
and
behold
it
was
even
war
and
the
man
remembered
the
little
things
that
he
knew
and
thought
of
the
quiet
days
that
there
used
to
be
and
at
night
on
the
hard
ground
dreamed
of
the
things
of
peace
and
dearer
and
dearer
grew
the
wonted
things
the
dull
but
easeful
things
of
the
days
of
peace
and
remembering
these
he
began
to
regret
the
war
and
sought
once
more
a
boon
of
the
ancient
gods
and
appearing
before
them
he
said
o
ancient
gods
indeed
but
a
man
loves
best
the
days
of
peace
therefore
take
back
your
war
and
give
us
peace
for
indeed
of
all
your
blessedness
peace
is
best
and
the
man
returned
again
to
the
haunts
of
peace
but
in
a
while
the
man
grew
weary
of
peace
of
the
things
that
he
used
to
know
and
the
savour
of
sameness
again
and
sighing
again
for
the
tents
and
appearing
once
more
to
the
gods
he
said
to
them
ancient
gods
we
do
not
love
your
peace
for
indeed
the
days
are
dull
and
a
man
is
best
at
war
and
the
gods
made
him
a
war
and
there
were
drums
again
the
smoke
of
campfires
again
wind
in
the
waste
again
the
sound
of
horses
of
war
burning
cities
again
and
the
things
that
wanderers
know
and
the
thoughts
of
that
man
went
home
to
the
ways
of
peace
moss
upon
lawns
again
light
in
old
spires
again
sun
upon
gardens
again
flowers
in
pleasant
woods
and
sleep
and
the
paths
of
peace
and
once
more
the
man
appeared
to
the
ancient
gods
and
sought
from
them
one
more
boon
and
said
to
them
ancient
gods
indeed
but
the
world
and
we
are
of
war
and
long
for
the
ancient
ways
and
the
paths
of
peace
so
the
gods
took
back
their
war
and
gave
him
peace
but
the
man
took
counsel
one
day
and
communed
long
with
himself
and
said
to
himself
behold
the
wishes
i
wish
which
the
gods
grant
are
not
to
be
much
desired
and
if
the
gods
should
one
day
grant
a
wish
and
never
revoke
it
which
is
a
way
of
the
gods
i
should
be
sorely
tried
because
of
my
wish
my
wishes
are
dangerous
wishes
and
not
to
be
desired
and
therefore
he
wrote
an
anonymous
letter
to
the
gods
writing
o
ancient
gods
this
man
that
hath
four
times
troubled
you
with
his
wishes
wishing
for
peace
and
war
is
a
man
that
hath
no
reverence
for
the
gods
speaking
ill
of
them
on
days
when
they
do
not
hear
and
speaking
well
of
them
on
holy
days
and
at
the
appointed
hours
when
the
gods
are
hearkening
to
prayer
therefore
grant
no
more
wishes
to
this
impious
man
and
the
days
of
peace
wore
on
and
there
arose
again
from
the
earth
like
mist
in
the
autumn
from
the
fields
that
generations
have
ploughed
the
savour
of
sameness
again
and
the
man
went
forth
one
morning
and
appeared
once
more
to
the
gods
and
cried
o
ancient
gods
give
us
but
one
war
again
for
i
would
be
back
to
the
camps
and
debateable
borders
of
lands
and
the
gods
said
we
hear
not
well
of
your
way
of
life
yea
ill
things
have
come
to
our
hearing
so
that
we
grant
no
more
the
wishes
you
wish
the
sack
of
emeralds
one
bad
october
night
in
the
high
wolds
beyond
wiltshire
with
a
north
wind
chaunting
of
winter
with
the
old
leaves
letting
go
their
hold
one
by
one
from
branches
and
dropping
down
to
decay
with
a
mournful
sound
of
owls
and
in
fearsome
loneliness
there
trudged
in
broken
boots
and
in
wet
and
windy
rags
an
old
man
stooping
low
under
a
sack
of
emeralds
it
were
easy
to
see
had
you
been
travelling
late
on
that
inauspicious
night
that
the
burden
of
the
sack
was
far
too
great
for
the
poor
old
man
that
bore
it
and
had
you
flashed
a
lantern
in
his
face
there
was
a
look
there
of
hopelessness
and
fatigue
that
would
have
told
you
it
was
no
wish
of
his
that
kept
him
tottering
on
under
that
bloated
sack
when
the
menacing
look
of
the
night
and
its
cheerless
sounds
and
the
cold
and
the
weight
of
the
sack
had
all
but
brought
him
to
the
door
of
death
and
he
had
dropped
his
sack
onto
the
road
and
was
dragging
it
on
behind
him
just
as
he
felt
that
his
final
hour
was
come
and
come
which
was
worse
as
he
held
the
accursed
sack
just
then
he
saw
the
bulk
and
the
black
shape
of
the
sign
of
the
lost
shepherd
loom
up
by
the
ragged
way
he
opened
the
door
and
staggered
into
the
light
and
sank
on
a
bench
with
his
huge
sack
beside
him
all
this
you
had
seen
had
you
been
on
that
lonely
road
so
late
on
those
bitter
wolds
with
their
outlines
vast
and
mournful
in
the
dark
and
their
little
clumps
of
trees
sad
with
october
but
neither
you
nor
i
were
out
that
night
i
did
not
see
the
poor
old
man
and
his
sack
until
he
sank
down
all
of
a
heap
in
the
lighted
inn
and
yon
the
blacksmith
was
there
and
the
carpenter
willie
losh
and
jackers
the
postman
son
and
they
gave
him
a
glass
of
beer
and
the
old
man
drank
it
up
still
hugging
his
emeralds
and
at
last
they
asked
him
what
he
had
in
his
sack
the
question
he
clearly
dreaded
and
he
only
clasped
yet
tighter
the
sodden
sack
and
mumbled
he
had
potatoes
potatoes
said
yon
the
blacksmith
potatoes
said
willie
losh
and
when
he
heard
the
doubt
that
was
in
their
voices
the
old
man
shivered
and
moaned
potatoes
did
you
say
said
the
postman
son
and
they
all
three
rose
and
tried
to
peer
at
the
sack
that
the
wayfarer
so
zealously
sheltered
and
from
the
old
man
fierceness
i
had
said
that
had
it
not
been
for
that
foul
night
on
the
roads
and
the
weight
he
had
carried
so
far
and
the
fearful
winds
of
october
he
had
fought
with
the
blacksmith
the
carpenter
and
the
postman
son
all
three
till
he
beat
them
away
from
his
sack
and
weary
and
wet
as
he
was
he
fought
them
hard
i
should
no
doubt
have
interfered
and
yet
the
three
men
meant
no
harm
to
the
wayfarer
but
resented
the
reticence
that
he
displayed
to
them
though
they
had
given
him
beer
it
was
to
them
as
though
a
master
key
had
failed
to
open
a
cupboard
and
as
for
me
curiosity
held
me
down
to
my
chair
and
forbade
me
to
interfere
on
behalf
of
the
sack
for
the
old
man
furtive
ways
and
the
night
out
of
which
he
came
and
the
hour
of
his
coming
and
the
look
of
his
sack
all
made
me
long
as
much
to
know
what
he
had
as
even
the
blacksmith
the
carpenter
and
the
postman
son
and
then
they
found
the
emeralds
they
were
all
bigger
than
hazel
nuts
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
them
and
the
old
man
screamed
come
come
we
not
thieves
said
the
blacksmith
we
not
thieves
said
the
carpenter
we
not
thieves
said
the
postman
son
and
with
awful
fear
on
his
face
the
wayfarer
closed
his
sack
whimpering
over
his
emeralds
and
furtively
glancing
round
as
though
the
loss
of
his
secret
were
and
utterly
deadly
thing
and
then
they
asked
him
to
give
them
just
one
each
just
one
huge
emerald
each
because
they
had
given
him
a
glass
of
beer
then
to
see
the
wayfarer
shrink
against
his
sack
and
guard
it
with
clutching
fingers
one
would
have
said
that
he
was
a
selfish
man
were
it
not
for
the
terror
that
was
freezing
his
face
i
have
seen
men
look
sheer
at
death
with
far
less
fear
and
they
took
their
emerald
all
three
one
enormous
emerald
each
while
the
old
man
hopelessly
struggled
till
he
saw
his
three
emeralds
go
and
fell
to
the
floor
and
wept
a
pitiable
sodden
heap
and
about
that
time
i
began
to
hear
far
off
down
the
windy
road
by
which
that
sack
had
come
faintly
at
first
and
slowly
louder
and
louder
the
click
clack
clop
of
a
lame
horse
coming
nearer
click
clack
clop
and
a
loose
shoe
rattling
the
sound
of
a
horse
too
weary
to
be
out
upon
such
a
night
too
lame
to
be
out
at
all
click
clack
clop
and
all
of
a
sudden
the
old
wayfarer
heard
it
heard
it
above
the
sound
of
his
won
sobbing
and
at
once
went
white
to
the
lips
such
sudden
fear
as
blanched
him
in
a
moment
struck
right
to
the
hearts
of
all
there
they
muttered
to
him
that
it
was
only
their
play
they
hastily
whispered
excuses
they
asked
him
what
was
wrong
but
seemed
scarcely
to
hope
for
an
answer
nor
did
he
speak
but
sat
with
a
frozen
stare
all
at
once
a
monument
to
terror
nearer
and
nearer
came
the
click
clack
clop
and
when
i
saw
the
expression
of
that
man
face
and
how
its
horror
deepened
as
the
ominous
sound
drew
nearer
then
i
knew
that
something
was
wrong
and
looking
for
the
last
time
upon
all
four
i
saw
the
wayfarer
by
his
sack
and
the
other
three
crowding
round
to
put
their
huge
emeralds
back
then
even
on
such
a
night
i
slipped
away
from
the
inn
outside
the
bitter
wind
roared
in
my
ears
and
close
in
the
darkness
the
horse
went
click
clack
clop
and
as
soon
as
my
eyes
could
see
at
all
in
the
night
i
saw
a
man
in
a
huge
hat
looped
up
in
front
wearing
a
sword
in
a
scabbard
shabby
and
huge
and
looking
blacker
than
the
darkness
riding
on
a
lean
horse
slowly
up
to
the
inn
whether
his
were
the
emeralds
or
who
he
was
or
why
he
rode
a
lame
horse
on
such
a
night
i
did
not
stop
to
discover
but
went
at
once
from
the
inn
as
he
strode
in
his
great
black
riding
coat
up
to
the
door
and
that
was
the
last
that
was
ever
seen
of
the
wayfarer
the
blacksmith
the
carpenter
or
the
postman
son
the
old
brown
coat
my
friend
douglas
ainslie
tells
me
that
sir
james
barrie
once
told
him
this
story
the
story
or
rather
the
fragment
was
as
follows
a
man
strolling
into
an
auction
somewhere
abroad
i
think
it
must
have
been
france
for
they
bid
in
francs
found
they
were
selling
old
clothes
and
following
some
idle
whim
he
soon
found
himself
bidding
for
an
old
coat
a
man
bid
against
him
he
bid
against
the
man
up
and
up
went
the
price
till
the
old
coat
was
knocked
down
to
him
for
twenty
pounds
as
he
went
away
with
the
coat
he
saw
the
other
bidder
looking
at
him
with
an
expression
of
fury
that
as
far
as
the
story
goes
but
how
ainslie
asked
me
did
the
matter
develop
and
why
that
furious
look
i
at
once
made
enquiries
at
a
reliable
source
and
have
ascertained
that
the
name
was
peters
who
thus
oddly
purchased
a
coat
and
that
he
took
it
to
the
rue
de
rivoli
to
a
hotel
where
he
lodged
from
the
little
low
dark
auction
room
by
the
seine
in
which
he
concluded
the
bargain
there
he
examined
it
off
and
on
all
day
and
much
of
the
next
morning
a
light
brown
overcoat
with
tails
without
discovering
any
excuse
far
less
a
reason
for
having
spent
twenty
pounds
on
so
worn
a
thing
and
late
next
morning
to
his
sitting
room
looking
out
on
the
gardens
of
the
tuileries
the
man
with
the
furious
look
was
ushered
in
grim
he
stood
silent
and
angry
till
the
guiding
waiter
went
not
till
then
did
he
speak
and
his
words
came
clear
and
brief
welling
up
from
deep
emotions
how
did
you
dare
to
bid
against
me
his
name
was
santiago
and
for
many
moments
peters
found
no
excuse
to
offer
no
apology
nothing
in
extenuation
lamely
at
last
weakly
knowing
his
argument
to
be
of
no
avail
he
muttered
something
to
the
intent
that
santiago
could
have
outbid
him
no
said
the
stranger
we
do
want
all
the
town
in
this
this
is
a
matter
between
you
and
me
he
paused
then
added
in
his
fierce
curt
way
a
thousand
pounds
no
more
almost
dumbly
peters
accepted
the
offer
and
pocketing
the
thousand
pounds
that
was
paid
him
and
apologizing
for
the
inconvenience
he
had
unwittingly
caused
tried
to
show
the
stranger
out
but
santiago
strode
swiftly
on
before
him
taking
the
coat
and
was
gone
there
followed
between
peters
and
his
second
thoughts
another
long
afternoon
of
bitter
reproaches
why
ever
had
he
let
go
so
thoughtlessly
of
a
garment
that
so
easily
fetched
a
thousand
pounds
and
the
more
he
brooded
on
this
the
more
clearly
did
he
perceive
that
he
had
lost
an
unusual
opportunity
of
a
first
class
investment
of
a
speculative
kind
he
knew
men
perhaps
better
than
he
knew
materials
and
though
he
could
not
see
in
that
old
brown
coat
the
value
of
so
much
as
a
thousand
pounds
he
saw
far
more
than
that
in
the
eager
need
for
it
an
afternoon
of
brooding
over
lost
opportunities
led
to
a
night
of
remorse
and
scarcely
had
day
dawned
when
he
ran
to
his
to
see
if
he
still
had
safe
the
card
of
santiago
and
there
was
the
neat
and
perfumed
de
with
parisian
address
in
the
corner
that
morning
he
sought
him
out
and
found
santiago
seated
at
a
table
with
chemicals
and
magnifying
glasses
beside
him
examining
as
it
lay
spread
wide
before
him
the
old
brown
coat
and
peters
fancied
he
wore
a
puzzled
air
they
came
at
once
to
business
peters
was
rich
and
asked
santiago
to
name
his
price
and
that
small
dark
man
admitted
financial
straits
and
so
was
willing
to
sell
for
thirty
thousand
pounds
a
little
bargaining
followed
the
price
came
down
and
the
old
brown
coat
changed
hands
once
more
for
twenty
thousand
pounds
let
any
who
may
be
inclined
to
doubt
my
story
understand
that
in
the
city
as
any
respectable
company
promoter
will
tell
them
twenty
thousand
pounds
is
invested
almost
daily
with
less
return
for
it
than
an
old
tail
coat
and
whatever
doubts
peters
felt
that
day
about
the
wisdom
of
his
investment
there
before
him
lay
that
tangible
return
that
something
that
may
be
actually
fingered
and
seen
which
is
so
often
denied
to
the
investor
in
gold
mines
and
other
selected
investments
yet
as
the
days
wore
on
and
the
old
coat
grew
no
younger
nor
any
more
wonderful
nor
the
least
useful
but
more
and
more
like
an
ordinary
old
coat
peters
began
once
more
to
doubt
his
astuteness
before
the
week
was
out
his
doubts
had
grown
acute
and
then
one
morning
santiago
returned
a
man
he
said
had
just
arrived
from
spain
a
friend
unexpected
all
of
a
sudden
in
paris
from
whom
he
might
borrow
money
and
would
peters
resell
the
coat
for
thirty
thousand
pounds
it
was
then
that
peters
seeing
his
opportunity
cast
aside
the
pretence
that
he
had
maintained
for
so
long
of
knowing
something
about
the
mysterious
coat
and
demanded
to
know
its
properties
santiago
swore
that
he
knew
not
and
repeatedly
swore
the
same
by
many
sacred
names
but
when
peters
as
often
threatened
not
to
sell
santiago
at
last
drew
out
a
thin
cigar
and
lighting
it
and
settling
himself
in
a
chair
told
all
he
knew
of
the
coat
he
had
been
on
its
tracks
for
weeks
with
suspicions
growing
all
the
time
that
it
was
no
ordinary
coat
and
at
last
he
had
run
it
to
earth
in
that
auction
room
but
would
not
bid
for
it
more
than
twenty
pounds
for
fear
of
letting
every
one
into
the
secret
what
the
secret
was
he
swore
he
did
not
know
but
this
much
he
knew
all
along
that
the
weight
of
the
coat
was
absolutely
nothing
and
he
had
discovered
by
testing
it
with
acids
that
the
brown
stuff
of
which
the
coat
was
made
was
neither
cloth
nor
silk
nor
any
known
material
and
would
neither
burn
nor
tear
he
believed
it
to
be
some
undiscovered
element
and
the
properties
of
the
coat
which
he
was
convinced
were
marvellous
he
felt
sure
of
discovering
within
another
week
by
means
of
experiments
with
his
chemicals
again
he
offered
thirty
thousand
pounds
to
be
paid
within
two
or
three
days
if
all
went
well
and
then
they
started
haggling
together
as
business
men
will
and
all
the
morning
went
by
over
the
gardens
of
the
tuileries
and
the
afternoons
came
on
and
only
by
two
they
arrived
at
an
understanding
on
a
basis
as
they
called
it
of
thirty
thousand
guineas
and
the
old
tail
coat
was
brought
out
and
spread
on
the
table
and
they
examined
it
together
and
chatted
about
its
properties
all
the
more
friendly
for
their
strenuous
argument
and
santiago
was
rising
up
to
go
and
peters
pleasantly
holding
out
his
hand
when
a
step
was
heard
on
the
stair
it
echoed
up
to
the
room
the
door
opened
and
an
elderly
labouring
man
came
stumping
in
he
walked
with
difficulty
almost
like
a
bather
who
has
been
swimming
and
floating
all
morning
and
misses
the
buoyancy
of
the
water
when
he
has
come
to
land
he
stumped
up
to
the
table
without
speaking
and
there
at
once
caught
sight
of
the
old
brown
coat
why
he
said
that
be
my
old
coat
and
without
another
word
he
put
it
on
in
the
fierce
glare
of
his
eyes
as
he
fitted
on
that
coat
carefully
fastening
the
buttons
buttoning
up
the
flap
of
a
pocket
here
unbuttoning
one
there
neither
peters
nor
santiago
found
a
word
to
say
they
sat
there
wondering
how
they
had
dared
to
bid
for
that
brown
tail
coat
how
they
had
dared
to
buy
it
even
to
touch
it
they
sat
there
silent
without
a
single
excuse
and
with
no
word
more
the
old
labourer
stumped
across
the
room
opened
wide
the
double
window
that
looked
on
the
tuileries
gardens
and
flashing
back
over
his
shoulder
one
look
that
was
full
of
scorn
stumped
away
up
through
the
air
at
an
angle
of
forty
degrees
peters
and
santiago
saw
him
bear
to
his
left
from
the
window
passing
diagonally
over
the
rue
de
rivoli
and
over
a
corner
of
the
tuileries
gardens
they
saw
him
clear
the
louvre
and
thence
they
dumbly
watched
him
still
slanting
upwards
stepping
out
with
a
firmer
and
more
confident
stride
as
he
dwindled
and
dwindled
away
with
his
old
brown
coat
neither
spoke
till
he
was
no
more
than
a
speck
in
the
sky
far
away
over
paris
going
south
eastwards
well
i
am
blowed
said
peters
but
santiago
sadly
shook
his
head
i
knew
it
was
a
good
coat
he
said
i
it
was
a
good
coat
an
archive
of
the
older
mysteries
it
is
told
in
the
archive
of
the
older
mysteries
of
china
that
one
of
the
house
of
tlang
was
cunning
with
sharpened
iron
and
went
to
the
green
jade
mountains
and
carved
a
green
jade
god
and
this
was
in
the
cycle
of
the
dragon
the
year
and
for
nearly
a
hundred
years
men
doubted
the
green
jade
god
and
then
they
worshipped
him
for
a
thousand
years
and
after
that
they
doubted
him
again
and
the
green
jade
god
made
a
miracle
and
whelmed
the
green
jade
mountains
sinking
them
down
one
evening
at
sunset
into
the
earth
so
that
there
is
only
a
marsh
where
the
green
jade
mountains
were
and
the
marsh
is
full
of
the
lotus
by
the
side
of
this
lotus
marsh
just
as
it
glitters
at
evening
walks
li
la
ting
the
chinese
girl
to
bring
the
cows
home
she
goes
behind
them
singing
of
the
river
lo
lang
ho
and
thus
she
sings
of
the
river
even
of
lo
lang
ho
she
sings
that
he
is
indeed
of
all
rivers
the
greatest
born
of
more
ancient
mountains
than
even
the
wise
men
know
swifter
than
hares
more
deep
than
the
sea
the
master
of
other
rivers
perfumed
even
as
roses
and
fairer
than
the
sapphires
around
the
neck
of
a
prince
and
then
she
would
pray
to
the
river
lo
lang
ho
master
of
rivers
and
rival
of
the
heaven
at
dawn
to
bring
her
down
in
a
boat
of
light
bamboo
a
lover
rowing
out
of
the
inner
land
in
a
garment
of
yellow
silk
with
turquoises
at
his
waist
young
and
merry
and
idle
with
a
face
as
yellow
as
gold
and
a
ruby
in
his
cap
with
lanterns
shining
at
dusk
thus
she
would
pray
of
an
evening
to
the
river
lo
lang
ho
as
she
went
behind
the
cows
at
the
edge
of
the
lotus
marshes
and
the
green
jade
god
under
the
lotus
marshes
was
jealous
of
the
lover
that
the
maiden
li
la
ting
would
pray
for
of
an
evening
to
the
river
lo
lang
ho
and
he
cursed
the
river
after
the
manner
of
gods
and
turned
it
into
a
narrow
and
evil
smelling
stream
and
all
this
happened
a
thousand
years
ago
and
lo
lang
ho
is
but
a
reproach
among
travelers
and
the
story
of
that
great
river
is
forgotten
and
what
became
of
the
maiden
no
tale
saith
though
all
men
think
she
became
a
goddess
of
jade
to
sit
and
smile
at
a
lotus
on
a
lotus
carven
of
stone
by
the
side
of
the
green
jade
god
far
under
the
marshes
upon
the
peaks
of
the
mountains
but
women
know
that
her
ghost
still
haunts
the
lotus
marshes
on
glittering
evenings
singing
of
lo
lang
ho
a
city
of
wonder
past
the
upper
corner
of
a
precipice
the
moon
rode
into
view
night
had
for
some
while
now
hooded
the
marvelous
city
they
had
planned
it
to
be
symmetrical
its
maps
were
orderly
near
in
two
dimensions
that
is
length
and
breadth
its
streets
met
and
crossed
each
other
with
regular
exactitude
with
all
the
dullness
of
the
science
of
man
the
city
had
laughed
as
it
were
and
shaken
itself
free
and
in
the
third
dimension
had
soared
away
to
consort
with
all
the
careless
irregular
things
that
know
not
man
for
their
master
yet
even
there
even
at
those
altitudes
man
had
still
clung
to
his
symmetry
still
claimed
that
these
mountains
were
houses
in
orderly
rows
the
thousand
windows
stood
watching
each
other
precisely
all
orderly
all
alike
lest
any
should
guess
by
day
that
there
might
be
mystery
here
so
they
stood
in
the
daylight
the
sun
set
still
they
were
orderly
as
scientific
and
regular
as
the
labour
of
only
man
and
the
bees
the
mists
darken
at
evening
and
first
the
woolworth
building
goes
away
sheer
home
and
away
from
any
allegiance
to
man
to
take
his
place
among
mountains
for
i
saw
him
stand
with
the
lower
slopes
invisible
in
the
gloaming
while
only
his
pinnacles
showed
up
in
the
clearer
sky
thus
only
mountains
stand
still
all
the
windows
of
the
other
buildings
stood
in
their
regular
rows
all
side
by
side
in
silence
not
yet
changed
as
though
waiting
one
furtive
moment
to
step
from
the
schemes
of
man
to
slip
back
to
mystery
and
romance
again
as
cats
do
when
they
steal
on
velvet
feet
away
from
familiar
hearths
in
the
dark
of
the
moon
night
fell
and
the
moment
came
someone
lit
a
window
far
up
another
shone
with
its
orange
glow
window
by
window
and
yet
not
nearly
all
surely
if
modern
man
with
his
clever
schemes
held
any
sway
here
still
he
would
have
turned
one
switch
and
lit
them
all
together
but
we
are
back
with
the
older
man
of
whom
far
songs
tell
he
whose
spirit
is
kin
to
strange
romances
and
mountains
one
by
one
the
windows
shine
from
the
precipices
some
twinkle
some
are
dark
man
orderly
schemes
have
gone
and
we
are
amongst
vast
heights
lit
by
inscrutable
beacons
i
have
seen
such
cities
before
and
i
have
told
of
them
in
book
of
here
in
new
york
a
poet
met
a
welcome
beyond
the
fields
we
know
publisher
note
beyond
the
fields
we
know
in
the
lands
of
dream
lies
the
valley
of
the
yann
where
the
mighty
river
of
that
name
rising
in
the
hills
of
hap
idleing
its
way
by
massive
amethyst
cliffs
forests
and
ancient
mysterious
cities
comes
to
the
gates
of
yann
and
passes
to
the
sea
some
years
since
a
poet
visiting
that
land
voyaged
down
the
yann
on
a
trading
bark
named
the
of
the
and
returning
safe
to
ireland
set
down
in
a
tale
that
is
called
days
on
the
the
wonders
of
that
voyage
now
the
tale
being
one
of
marvellous
beauty
found
its
way
into
a
volume
we
call
dreamer
where
it
may
be
found
to
this
day
with
other
wondrous
tales
of
that
same
poet
as
the
days
went
by
the
lure
of
the
river
and
pleasant
memories
of
his
shipmates
bore
in
with
a
constant
urge
on
the
soul
of
the
poet
that
he
might
once
more
journey
beyond
the
fields
we
know
and
come
to
the
floor
of
yann
and
one
day
it
fell
out
that
turning
into
street
that
leads
up
from
the
embankment
toward
the
strand
and
which
you
and
i
always
do
go
by
and
perhaps
never
see
in
passing
he
found
the
door
which
one
enters
on
the
way
to
the
land
of
dream
twice
of
late
has
lord
dunsany
entered
that
door
in
street
and
returned
to
the
valley
of
the
yann
and
each
time
come
back
with
a
tale
one
of
his
search
for
the
of
the
river
the
other
of
the
mighty
hunter
who
avenged
the
destruction
of
perdóndaris
where
on
his
earlier
voyage
the
captain
tied
up
his
ship
and
traded
within
the
city
that
all
may
be
clear
to
those
who
read
these
new
tales
and
to
whom
no
report
has
previously
come
beyond
the
fields
we
know
the
publishers
reprint
in
this
volume
days
on
the
idle
days
on
the
yann
so
i
came
down
through
the
wood
to
the
bank
of
yann
and
found
as
had
been
prophesied
the
ship
of
the
about
to
loose
her
cable
the
captain
sate
upon
the
white
deck
with
his
scimitar
lying
beside
him
in
its
jewelled
scabbard
and
the
sailors
toiled
to
spread
the
nimble
sails
to
bring
the
ship
into
the
central
stream
of
yann
and
all
the
while
sang
ancient
soothing
songs
and
the
wind
of
the
evening
descending
cool
from
the
snowfields
of
some
mountainous
abode
of
distant
gods
came
suddenly
like
glad
tidings
to
an
anxious
city
into
the
sails
and
so
we
came
into
the
central
stream
whereat
the
sailors
lowered
the
greater
sails
but
i
had
gone
to
bow
before
the
captain
and
to
inquire
concerning
the
miracles
and
appearances
among
men
of
the
most
holy
gods
of
whatever
land
he
had
come
from
and
the
captain
answered
that
he
came
from
fair
belzoond
and
worshipped
gods
that
were
the
least
and
humblest
who
seldom
sent
the
famine
or
the
thunder
and
were
easily
appeased
with
little
battles
and
i
told
how
i
came
from
ireland
which
is
of
europe
whereat
the
captain
and
all
the
sailors
laughed
for
they
said
there
are
no
such
places
in
all
the
land
of
dreams
when
they
had
ceased
to
mock
me
i
explained
that
my
fancy
mostly
dwelt
in
the
desert
of
about
a
beautiful
city
called
golthoth
the
damned
which
was
sentinelled
all
round
by
wolves
and
their
shadows
and
had
been
utterly
desolate
for
years
and
years
because
of
a
curse
which
the
gods
once
spoke
in
anger
and
could
never
since
recall
and
sometimes
my
dreams
took
me
as
far
as
pungar
vees
the
red
walled
city
where
the
fountains
are
which
trades
with
the
isles
and
thul
when
i
said
this
they
complimented
me
upon
the
abode
of
my
fancy
saying
that
though
they
had
never
seen
these
cities
such
places
might
well
be
imagined
for
the
rest
of
that
evening
i
bargained
with
the
captain
over
the
sum
that
i
should
pay
him
for
my
fare
if
god
and
the
tide
of
yann
should
bring
us
safely
as
far
as
the
cliffs
by
the
sea
which
are
named
the
gate
of
yann
and
now
the
sun
had
set
and
all
the
colours
of
the
world
and
heaven
had
held
a
festival
with
him
and
slipped
one
by
one
away
before
the
imminent
approach
of
night
the
parrots
had
all
flown
home
to
the
jungle
on
either
bank
the
monkeys
in
rows
in
safety
on
high
branches
of
the
trees
were
silent
and
asleep
the
fireflies
in
the
deeps
of
the
forest
were
going
up
and
down
and
the
great
stars
came
gleaming
out
to
look
on
the
face
of
yann
then
the
sailors
lighted
lanterns
and
hung
them
round
the
ship
and
the
light
flashed
out
on
a
sudden
and
dazzled
yann
and
the
ducks
that
fed
along
his
marshy
banks
all
suddenly
arose
and
made
wide
circles
in
the
upper
air
and
saw
the
distant
reaches
of
the
yann
and
the
white
mist
that
softly
cloaked
the
jungle
before
they
returned
again
into
their
marshes
and
then
the
sailors
knelt
on
the
decks
and
prayed
not
all
together
but
five
or
six
at
a
time
side
by
side
there
kneeled
down
together
five
or
six
for
there
only
prayed
at
the
same
time
men
of
different
faiths
so
that
no
god
should
hear
two
men
praying
to
him
at
once
as
soon
as
any
one
had
finished
his
prayer
another
of
the
same
faith
would
take
his
place
thus
knelt
the
row
of
five
or
six
with
bended
heads
under
the
fluttering
sail
while
the
central
stream
of
the
river
yann
took
them
on
towards
the
sea
and
their
prayers
rose
up
from
among
the
lanterns
and
went
towards
the
stars
and
behind
them
in
the
after
end
of
the
ship
the
helmsman
prayed
aloud
the
helmsman
prayer
which
is
prayed
by
all
who
follow
his
trade
upon
the
river
yann
of
whatever
faith
they
be
and
the
captain
prayed
to
his
little
lesser
gods
to
the
gods
that
bless
belzoond
and
i
too
felt
that
i
would
pray
yet
i
liked
not
to
pray
to
a
jealous
god
there
where
the
frail
affectionate
gods
whom
the
heathen
love
were
being
humbly
invoked
so
i
bethought
me
instead
of
sheol
nugganoth
whom
the
men
of
the
jungle
have
long
since
deserted
who
is
now
unworshipped
and
alone
and
to
him
i
prayed
and
upon
us
praying
the
night
came
suddenly
down
as
it
comes
upon
all
men
who
pray
at
evening
and
upon
all
men
who
do
not
yet
our
prayers
comforted
our
own
souls
when
we
thought
of
the
great
night
to
come
and
so
yann
bore
us
magnificently
onwards
for
he
was
elate
with
molten
snow
that
the
poltiades
had
brought
him
from
the
hills
of
hap
and
the
marn
and
migris
were
swollen
full
with
floods
and
he
bore
us
in
his
might
past
kyph
and
pir
and
we
saw
the
lights
of
goolunza
soon
we
all
slept
except
the
helmsman
who
kept
the
ship
in
the
midstream
of
yann
when
the
sun
rose
the
helmsman
ceased
to
sing
for
by
song
he
cheered
himself
in
the
lonely
night
when
the
song
ceased
we
suddenly
all
awoke
and
another
took
the
helm
and
the
helmsman
slept
we
knew
that
soon
we
should
come
to
mandaroon
we
made
a
meal
and
mandaroon
appeared
then
the
captain
commanded
and
the
sailors
loosed
again
the
greater
sails
and
the
ship
turned
and
left
the
stream
of
yann
and
came
into
a
harbour
beneath
the
ruddy
walls
of
mandaroon
then
while
the
sailors
went
and
gathered
fruits
i
came
alone
to
the
gate
of
mandaroon
a
few
huts
were
outside
it
in
which
lived
the
guard
a
sentinel
with
a
long
white
beard
was
standing
in
the
gate
armed
with
a
rusty
pike
he
wore
large
spectacles
which
were
covered
with
dust
through
the
gate
i
saw
the
city
a
deathly
stillness
was
over
all
of
it
the
ways
seemed
untrodden
and
moss
was
thick
on
doorsteps
in
the
huddled
figures
lay
asleep
a
scent
of
incense
and
burned
poppies
and
there
was
a
hum
of
the
echoes
of
distant
bells
i
said
to
the
sentinel
in
the
tongue
of
the
region
of
yann
why
are
they
all
asleep
in
this
still
city
he
answered
none
may
ask
questions
in
this
gate
for
fear
they
wake
the
people
of
the
city
for
when
the
people
of
this
city
wake
the
gods
will
die
and
when
the
gods
die
men
may
dream
no
more
and
i
began
to
ask
him
what
gods
that
city
worshipped
but
he
lifted
his
pike
because
none
might
ask
questions
there
so
i
left
him
and
went
back
to
the
of
the
certainly
mandaroon
was
beautiful
with
her
white
pinnacles
peering
over
her
ruddy
walls
and
the
green
of
her
copper
roofs
when
i
came
back
again
to
the
of
the
i
found
the
sailors
were
returned
to
the
ship
soon
we
weighed
anchor
and
sailed
out
again
and
so
came
once
more
to
the
middle
of
the
river
and
now
the
sun
was
moving
towards
his
heights
and
there
had
reached
us
on
the
river
yann
the
song
of
those
countless
myriads
of
choirs
that
attend
him
in
his
progress
round
the
world
for
the
little
creatures
that
have
many
legs
had
spread
their
gauze
wings
easily
on
the
air
as
a
man
rests
his
elbows
on
a
balcony
and
gave
jubilant
ceremonial
praises
to
the
sun
or
else
they
moved
together
on
the
air
in
wavering
dances
intricate
and
swift
or
turned
aside
to
avoid
the
onrush
of
some
drop
of
water
that
a
breeze
had
shaken
from
a
jungle
orchid
chilling
the
air
and
driving
it
before
it
as
it
fell
whirring
in
its
rush
to
the
earth
but
all
the
while
they
sang
triumphantly
for
the
day
is
for
us
they
said
whether
our
great
and
sacred
father
the
sun
shall
bring
up
more
life
like
us
from
the
marshes
or
whether
all
the
world
shall
end
and
there
sang
all
those
whose
notes
are
known
to
human
ears
as
well
as
those
whose
far
more
numerous
notes
have
never
been
heard
by
man
to
these
a
rainy
day
had
been
as
an
era
of
war
that
should
desolate
continents
during
all
the
lifetime
of
a
man
and
there
came
out
also
from
the
dark
and
steaming
jungle
to
behold
and
rejoice
in
the
sun
the
huge
and
lazy
butterflies
and
they
danced
but
danced
idly
on
the
ways
of
the
air
as
some
haughty
queen
of
distant
conquered
lands
might
in
her
poverty
and
exile
dance
in
some
encampment
of
the
gipsies
for
the
mere
bread
to
live
by
but
beyond
that
would
never
abate
her
pride
to
dance
for
a
fragment
more
and
the
butterflies
sung
of
strange
and
painted
things
of
purple
orchids
and
of
lost
pink
cities
and
the
monstrous
colours
of
the
jungle
decay
and
they
too
were
among
those
whose
voices
are
not
discernible
by
human
ears
and
as
they
floated
above
the
river
going
from
forest
to
forest
their
splendour
was
matched
by
the
inimical
beauty
of
the
birds
who
darted
out
to
pursue
them
or
sometimes
they
settled
on
the
white
and
blooms
of
the
plant
that
creeps
and
clambers
about
the
trees
of
the
forest
and
their
purple
wings
flashed
out
on
the
great
blossoms
as
when
the
caravans
go
from
nurl
to
thace
the
gleaming
silks
flash
out
upon
the
snow
where
the
crafty
merchants
spread
them
one
by
one
to
astonish
the
mountaineers
of
the
hills
of
noor
but
upon
men
and
beasts
the
sun
sent
a
drowsiness
the
river
monsters
along
the
river
marge
lay
dormant
in
the
slime
the
sailors
pitched
a
pavilion
with
golden
tassels
for
the
captain
upon
the
deck
and
then
went
all
but
the
helmsman
under
a
sail
that
they
had
hung
as
an
awning
between
two
masts
then
they
told
tales
to
one
another
each
of
his
own
city
or
of
the
miracles
of
his
god
until
all
were
fallen
asleep
the
captain
offered
me
the
shade
of
his
pavilion
with
the
gold
tassels
and
there
we
talked
for
a
while
he
telling
me
that
he
was
taking
merchandise
to
perdóndaris
and
that
he
would
take
back
to
fair
belzoond
things
appertaining
to
the
affairs
of
the
sea
then
as
i
watched
through
the
pavilion
opening
the
brilliant
birds
and
butterflies
that
crossed
and
recrossed
over
the
river
i
fell
asleep
and
dreamed
that
i
was
a
monarch
entering
his
capital
underneath
arches
of
flags
and
all
the
musicians
of
the
world
were
there
playing
melodiously
their
instruments
but
no
one
cheered
in
the
afternoon
as
the
day
grew
cooler
again
i
awoke
and
found
the
captain
buckling
on
his
scimitar
which
he
had
taken
off
him
while
he
rested
and
now
we
were
approaching
the
wide
court
of
astahahn
which
opens
upon
the
river
strange
boats
of
antique
design
were
chained
there
to
the
steps
as
we
neared
it
we
saw
the
open
marble
court
on
three
sides
of
which
stood
the
city
fronting
on
colonnades
and
in
the
court
and
along
the
colonnades
the
people
of
that
city
walked
with
solemnity
and
care
according
to
the
rites
of
ancient
ceremony
all
in
that
city
was
of
ancient
device
the
carving
on
the
houses
which
when
age
had
broken
it
remained
unrepaired
was
of
the
remotest
times
and
everywhere
were
represented
in
stone
beasts
that
have
long
since
passed
away
from
earth
the
dragon
the
griffin
and
the
hippogriffin
and
the
different
species
of
gargoyle
nothing
was
to
be
found
whether
material
or
custom
that
was
new
in
astahahn
now
they
took
no
notice
at
all
of
us
as
we
went
by
but
continued
their
processions
and
ceremonies
in
the
ancient
city
and
the
sailors
knowing
their
custom
took
no
notice
of
them
but
i
called
as
we
came
near
to
one
who
stood
beside
the
water
edge
asking
him
what
men
did
in
astahahn
and
what
their
merchandise
was
and
with
whom
they
traded
he
said
here
we
have
fettered
and
manacled
time
who
would
otherwise
slay
the
gods
i
asked
him
what
gods
they
worshipped
in
that
city
and
he
said
all
those
gods
whom
time
has
not
yet
slain
then
he
turned
from
me
and
would
say
no
more
but
busied
himself
in
behaving
in
accordance
with
ancient
custom
and
so
according
to
the
will
of
yann
we
drifted
onwards
and
left
astahahn
and
we
found
in
greater
quantities
such
birds
as
prey
on
fishes
and
they
were
very
wonderful
in
their
plumage
and
they
came
not
out
of
the
jungle
but
flew
with
their
long
necks
stretched
out
before
them
and
their
legs
lying
on
the
wind
behind
straight
up
the
river
over
the
and
now
the
evening
began
to
gather
in
a
thick
white
mist
had
appeared
over
the
river
and
was
softly
rising
higher
it
clutched
at
the
trees
with
long
impalpable
arms
it
rose
higher
and
higher
chilling
the
air
and
white
shapes
moved
away
into
the
jungle
as
though
the
ghosts
of
shipwrecked
mariners
were
searching
stealthily
in
the
darkness
for
the
spirits
of
evil
that
long
ago
had
wrecked
them
on
the
yann
as
the
sun
sank
behind
the
field
of
orchids
that
grew
on
the
matted
summit
of
the
jungle
the
river
monsters
came
wallowing
out
of
the
slime
in
which
they
had
reclined
during
the
heat
of
the
day
and
the
great
beasts
of
the
jungle
came
down
to
drink
the
butterflies
a
while
since
were
gone
to
rest
in
little
narrow
tributaries
that
we
passed
night
seemed
already
to
have
fallen
though
the
sun
which
had
disappeared
from
us
had
not
yet
set
and
now
the
birds
of
the
jungle
came
flying
home
far
over
us
with
the
sunlight
glistening
pink
upon
their
breasts
and
lowered
their
pinions
as
soon
as
they
saw
the
yann
and
dropped
into
the
trees
and
the
widgeon
began
to
go
up
the
river
in
great
companies
all
whistling
and
then
would
suddenly
wheel
and
all
go
down
again
and
there
shot
by
us
the
small
and
teal
and
we
heard
the
manifold
cries
of
flocks
of
geese
which
the
sailors
told
me
had
recently
come
in
from
crossing
over
the
lispasian
ranges
every
year
they
come
by
the
same
way
close
by
the
peak
of
mluna
leaving
it
to
the
left
and
the
mountain
eagles
know
the
way
they
come
and
men
say
the
very
hour
and
every
year
they
expect
them
by
the
same
way
as
soon
as
the
snows
have
fallen
upon
the
northern
plains
but
soon
it
grew
so
dark
that
we
saw
these
birds
no
more
and
only
heard
the
whirring
of
their
wings
and
of
countless
others
besides
until
they
all
settled
down
along
the
banks
of
the
river
and
it
was
the
hour
when
the
birds
of
the
night
went
forth
then
the
sailors
lit
the
lanterns
for
the
night
and
huge
moths
appeared
flapping
about
the
ship
and
at
moments
their
gorgeous
colours
would
be
revealed
by
the
lanterns
then
they
would
pass
into
the
night
again
where
all
was
black
and
again
the
sailors
prayed
and
thereafter
we
supped
and
slept
and
the
helmsman
took
our
lives
into
his
care
when
i
awoke
i
found
that
we
had
indeed
come
to
perdóndaris
that
famous
city
for
there
it
stood
upon
the
left
of
us
a
city
fair
and
notable
and
all
the
more
pleasant
for
our
eyes
to
see
after
the
jungle
that
was
so
long
with
us
and
we
were
anchored
by
the
marketplace
and
the
captain
merchandise
was
all
displayed
and
a
merchant
of
perdóndaris
stood
looking
at
it
and
the
captain
had
his
scimitar
in
his
hand
and
was
beating
with
it
in
anger
upon
the
deck
and
the
splinters
were
flying
up
from
the
white
planks
for
the
merchant
had
offered
him
a
price
for
his
merchandise
that
the
captain
declared
to
be
an
insult
to
himself
and
his
country
gods
whom
he
now
said
to
be
great
and
terrible
gods
whose
curses
were
to
be
dreaded
but
the
merchant
waved
his
hands
which
were
of
great
fatness
showing
his
pink
palms
and
swore
that
of
himself
he
thought
not
at
all
but
only
of
the
poor
folk
in
the
huts
beyond
the
city
to
whom
he
wished
to
sell
the
merchandise
for
as
low
a
price
as
possible
leaving
no
remuneration
for
himself
for
the
merchandise
was
mostly
the
thick
toomarund
carpets
that
in
the
winter
keep
the
wind
from
the
floor
and
tollub
which
the
people
smoke
in
pipes
therefore
the
merchant
said
if
he
offered
a
piffek
more
the
poor
folk
must
go
without
their
toomarunds
when
the
winter
came
and
without
their
tollub
in
the
evenings
or
else
he
and
his
aged
father
must
starve
together
thereat
the
captain
lifted
his
scimitar
to
his
own
throat
saying
that
he
was
now
a
ruined
man
and
that
nothing
remained
to
him
but
death
and
while
he
was
carefully
lifting
he
beard
with
his
left
hand
the
merchant
eyed
the
merchandise
again
and
said
that
rather
than
see
so
worthy
a
captain
die
a
man
for
whom
he
had
conceived
an
especial
love
when
first
he
saw
the
manner
in
which
he
handled
his
ship
he
and
his
aged
father
should
starve
together
and
therefore
he
offered
fifteen
piffeks
more
when
he
said
this
the
captain
prostrated
himself
and
prayed
to
his
gods
that
they
might
yet
sweeten
this
merchant
bitter
heart
to
his
little
lesser
gods
to
the
gods
that
bless
belzoond
at
last
the
merchant
offered
yet
five
piffeks
more
then
the
captain
wept
for
he
said
that
he
was
deserted
of
his
gods
and
the
merchant
also
wept
for
he
said
that
he
was
thinking
of
his
aged
father
and
of
how
soon
he
would
starve
and
he
hid
his
weeping
face
with
both
his
hands
and
eyed
the
tollub
again
between
his
fingers
and
so
the
bargain
was
concluded
and
the
merchant
took
the
toomarund
and
tollub
paying
for
them
out
of
a
great
clinking
purse
and
these
were
packed
up
into
bales
again
and
three
of
the
merchant
slaves
carried
them
upon
their
heads
into
the
city
and
all
the
while
the
sailors
had
sat
silent
in
a
crescent
upon
the
deck
eagerly
watching
the
bargain
and
now
a
murmur
of
satisfaction
arose
among
them
and
they
began
to
compare
it
among
themselves
with
other
bargains
that
they
had
known
and
i
found
out
from
them
that
there
are
seven
merchants
in
perdóndaris
and
that
they
had
all
come
to
the
captain
one
by
one
before
the
bargaining
began
and
each
had
warned
him
privately
against
the
others
and
to
all
the
merchants
the
captain
had
offered
the
wine
of
his
own
country
that
they
make
in
fair
belzoond
but
could
in
no
wise
persuade
them
to
it
but
now
that
the
bargain
was
over
and
the
sailors
were
seated
at
the
first
meal
of
the
day
the
captain
appeared
among
them
with
a
cask
of
that
wine
and
we
broached
it
with
care
and
all
made
merry
together
and
the
captain
was
glad
in
his
heart
because
he
knew
that
he
had
much
honour
in
the
eyes
of
his
men
because
of
the
bargain
that
he
had
made
so
the
sailors
drank
the
wine
of
their
native
land
and
soon
their
thoughts
were
back
in
fair
belzoond
and
the
little
neighbouring
cities
of
durl
and
duz
but
for
me
the
captain
poured
into
a
little
glass
some
heavy
yellow
wine
from
a
small
jar
which
he
kept
apart
among
his
sacred
things
thick
and
sweet
it
was
even
like
honey
yet
there
was
in
its
heart
a
mighty
ardent
fire
which
had
authority
over
souls
of
men
it
was
made
the
captain
told
me
with
great
subtlety
by
the
secret
craft
of
a
family
of
six
who
lived
in
a
hut
on
the
mountains
of
hian
min
once
in
these
mountains
he
said
he
followed
the
spoor
of
a
bear
and
he
came
suddenly
on
a
man
of
that
family
who
had
hunted
the
same
bear
and
he
was
at
the
end
of
a
narrow
way
with
precipice
all
about
him
and
his
spear
was
sticking
in
the
bear
and
the
wound
not
fatal
and
he
had
no
other
weapon
and
the
bear
was
walking
towards
the
man
very
slowly
because
his
wound
irked
him
yet
he
was
now
very
close
and
what
the
captain
did
he
would
not
say
but
every
year
as
soon
as
the
snows
are
hard
and
travelling
is
easy
on
the
hian
min
that
man
comes
down
to
the
market
in
the
plains
and
always
leaves
for
the
captain
in
the
gate
of
fair
belzoond
a
vessel
of
that
priceless
secret
wine
and
as
i
sipped
the
wine
and
the
captain
talked
i
remembered
me
of
stalwart
noble
things
that
i
had
long
since
resolutely
planned
and
my
soul
seemed
to
grow
mightier
within
me
and
to
dominate
the
whole
tide
of
the
yann
it
may
be
that
i
then
slept
or
if
i
did
not
i
do
not
now
minutely
recollect
every
detail
of
that
morning
occupations
towards
evening
i
awoke
and
wishing
to
see
perdóndaris
before
we
left
in
the
morning
and
being
unable
to
wake
the
captain
i
went
ashore
alone
certainly
perdóndaris
was
a
powerful
city
it
was
encompassed
by
a
wall
of
great
strength
and
altitude
having
in
it
hollow
ways
for
troops
to
walk
in
and
battlements
along
it
all
the
way
and
fifteen
strong
towers
on
it
in
every
mile
and
copper
plaques
low
down
where
men
could
read
them
telling
in
all
the
languages
of
those
parts
of
the
earth
one
language
on
each
plaque
the
tale
of
how
an
army
once
attacked
perdóndaris
and
what
befell
that
army
then
i
entered
perdóndaris
and
found
all
the
people
dancing
clad
in
brilliant
silks
and
playing
on
the
as
they
danced
for
a
fearful
thunderstorm
had
terrified
them
while
i
slept
and
the
fires
of
death
they
said
had
danced
over
perdóndaris
and
now
the
thunder
had
gone
leaping
away
large
and
black
and
hideous
they
said
over
the
distant
hills
and
had
turned
round
snarling
at
them
showing
his
gleaming
teeth
and
had
stamped
as
he
went
upon
the
hilltops
until
they
rang
as
though
they
had
been
bronze
and
often
and
again
they
stopped
in
their
merry
dances
and
prayed
to
the
god
they
knew
not
saying
o
god
that
we
know
not
we
thank
thee
for
sending
the
thunder
back
to
his
hills
and
i
went
on
and
came
to
the
and
lying
there
upon
the
marble
pavement
i
saw
the
merchant
fast
asleep
and
breathing
heavily
with
his
face
and
the
palms
of
his
hands
towards
the
sky
and
slaves
were
fanning
him
to
keep
away
the
flies
and
from
the
i
came
to
a
silver
temple
and
then
to
a
palace
of
onyx
and
there
were
many
wonders
in
perdóndaris
and
i
would
have
stayed
and
seen
them
all
but
as
i
came
to
the
outer
wall
of
the
city
i
suddenly
saw
in
it
a
huge
ivory
gate
for
a
while
i
paused
and
admired
it
then
i
came
nearer
and
perceived
the
dreadful
truth
the
gate
was
carved
out
of
one
solid
piece
i
fled
at
once
through
the
gateway
and
down
to
the
ship
and
even
as
i
ran
i
thought
that
i
heard
far
off
on
the
hills
behind
me
the
tramp
of
the
fearful
beast
by
whom
that
mass
of
ivory
was
shed
who
was
perhaps
even
then
looking
for
his
other
tusk
when
i
was
on
the
ship
again
i
felt
safer
and
i
said
nothing
to
the
sailors
of
what
i
had
seen
and
now
the
captain
was
gradually
awakening
now
night
was
rolling
up
from
the
east
and
north
and
only
the
pinnacles
of
the
towers
of
perdóndaris
still
took
the
fallen
sunlight
then
i
went
to
the
captain
and
told
him
quietly
of
the
thing
i
had
seen
and
he
questioned
me
at
once
about
the
gate
in
a
low
voice
that
the
sailors
might
not
know
and
i
told
him
how
the
weight
of
the
thing
was
such
that
it
could
not
have
been
brought
from
afar
and
the
captain
knew
that
it
had
not
been
there
a
year
ago
we
agreed
that
such
a
beast
could
never
have
been
killed
by
any
assault
of
man
and
that
the
gate
must
have
been
a
fallen
tusk
and
one
fallen
near
and
recently
therefore
he
decided
that
it
were
better
to
flee
at
once
so
he
commanded
and
the
sailors
went
to
the
sails
and
others
raised
the
anchor
to
the
deck
and
just
as
the
highest
pinnacle
of
marble
lost
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
we
left
perdóndaris
that
famous
city
and
night
came
down
and
cloaked
perdóndaris
and
hid
it
from
our
eyes
which
as
things
have
happened
will
never
see
it
again
for
i
have
heard
since
that
something
swift
and
wonderful
has
suddenly
wrecked
perdóndaris
in
a
day
towers
and
walls
and
people
and
the
night
deepened
over
the
river
yann
a
night
all
white
with
stars
and
with
the
night
there
arose
the
helmsman
song
as
soon
as
he
had
prayed
he
began
to
sing
to
cheer
himself
all
through
the
lonely
night
but
first
he
prayed
praying
the
helmsman
prayer
and
this
is
what
i
remember
of
it
rendered
into
english
with
a
very
feeble
equivalent
of
the
rhythm
that
seemed
so
resonant
in
those
tropic
nights
to
whatever
god
may
hear
wherever
there
be
sailors
whether
of
river
or
sea
whether
their
way
be
dark
or
whether
through
storm
whether
their
perils
be
of
beast
or
of
rock
or
from
enemy
lurking
on
land
or
pursuing
on
sea
wherever
the
tiller
is
cold
or
the
helmsman
stiff
wherever
sailors
sleep
or
helmsman
watch
guard
guide
and
return
us
to
the
old
land
that
has
known
us
to
the
far
homes
that
we
know
to
all
the
gods
that
are
to
whatever
god
may
hear
so
he
prayed
and
there
was
silence
and
the
sailors
laid
them
down
to
rest
for
the
night
the
silence
deepened
and
was
only
broken
by
the
ripples
of
yann
that
lightly
touched
our
prow
sometimes
some
monster
of
the
river
coughed
silence
and
ripples
ripples
and
silence
again
and
then
his
loneliness
came
upon
the
helmsman
and
he
began
to
sing
and
he
sang
the
market
songs
of
durl
and
duz
and
the
old
of
belzoond
many
a
song
he
sang
telling
to
spacious
and
exotic
yann
the
little
tales
and
trifles
of
his
city
of
durl
and
the
songs
welled
up
over
the
black
jungle
and
came
into
the
clear
cold
air
above
and
the
great
bands
of
stars
that
looked
on
yann
began
to
know
the
affairs
of
durl
and
duz
and
of
the
shepherds
that
dwelt
in
the
fields
between
and
the
flocks
that
they
had
and
the
loves
that
they
had
loved
and
all
the
little
things
that
they
hoped
to
do
and
as
i
lay
wrapped
up
in
skins
and
blankets
listening
to
those
songs
and
watching
the
fantastic
shapes
of
the
great
trees
like
to
black
giants
stalking
through
the
night
i
suddenly
fell
asleep
when
i
awoke
great
mists
were
trailing
away
from
the
yann
and
the
flow
of
the
river
was
tumbling
now
tumultuously
and
little
waves
appeared
for
yann
had
scented
from
afar
the
ancient
crags
of
glorm
and
knew
that
their
ravines
lay
cool
before
him
wherein
he
should
meet
the
merry
wild
irillion
rejoicing
from
fields
of
snow
so
he
shook
off
from
him
the
torpid
sleep
that
had
come
upon
him
in
the
hot
and
scented
jungle
and
forgot
its
orchids
and
its
butterflies
and
swept
on
turbulent
expectant
strong
and
soon
the
snowy
peaks
of
the
hills
of
glorm
came
glittering
into
view
and
now
the
sailors
were
waking
up
from
sleep
soon
we
all
ate
and
then
the
helmsman
laid
him
down
to
sleep
while
a
comrade
took
his
place
and
they
all
spread
over
him
their
choicest
furs
and
in
a
while
we
heard
the
sound
that
the
irillion
made
as
she
came
down
dancing
from
the
fields
of
snow
and
then
we
saw
the
ravine
in
the
hills
of
glorm
lying
precipitous
and
smooth
before
us
into
which
we
were
carried
by
the
leaps
of
yann
and
now
we
left
the
steamy
jungle
and
breathed
the
mountain
air
the
sailors
stood
up
and
took
deep
breaths
of
it
and
thought
of
their
own
acroctian
hills
on
which
were
durl
and
duz
below
them
in
the
plains
stands
fair
belzoond
a
great
shadow
brooded
between
the
cliffs
of
glorm
but
the
crags
were
shining
above
us
like
gnarled
moons
and
almost
lit
the
gloom
louder
and
louder
came
the
irillion
song
and
the
sound
of
her
dancing
down
from
the
fields
of
snow
and
soon
we
saw
her
white
and
full
of
mists
and
wreathed
with
rainbows
delicate
and
small
that
she
had
plucked
up
near
the
mountain
summit
from
some
celestial
garden
of
the
sun
then
she
went
away
seawards
with
the
huge
grey
yann
and
the
ravine
widened
and
opened
upon
the
world
and
our
rocking
ship
came
through
to
the
light
of
day
and
all
that
morning
and
all
the
afternoon
we
passed
through
the
marshes
of
pondoovery
and
yann
widened
there
and
flowed
solemnly
and
slowly
and
the
captain
bade
the
sailors
beat
on
bells
to
overcome
the
dreariness
of
the
marshes
at
last
the
irusian
mountains
came
in
sight
nursing
the
villages
of
and
blut
and
the
wandering
streets
of
mlo
where
priests
propitiate
the
avalanche
with
wine
and
maize
then
the
night
came
down
over
the
plains
of
tlun
and
we
saw
the
lights
of
cappadarnia
we
heard
the
pathnites
beating
upon
drums
as
we
passed
imaut
and
golzunda
then
all
but
the
helmsman
slept
and
villages
scattered
along
the
banks
of
the
yann
heard
all
that
night
in
the
unknown
tongue
the
little
songs
of
cities
that
they
know
not
i
awoke
before
dawn
with
a
feeling
that
i
was
unhappy
before
i
remembered
why
then
i
recalled
that
by
the
evening
of
the
approaching
day
according
to
all
forseen
probabilities
we
should
come
to
and
i
should
part
from
the
captain
and
his
sailors
and
i
had
liked
the
man
because
he
had
given
me
of
his
yellow
wine
that
was
set
apart
among
his
sacred
things
and
many
a
story
he
had
told
me
about
his
fair
belzoond
between
the
acrotian
hills
and
the
hian
min
and
i
had
liked
the
ways
that
his
sailors
had
and
the
prayers
that
they
prayed
at
evening
side
by
side
grudging
not
one
another
their
alien
gods
and
i
had
a
liking
too
for
the
tender
way
in
which
they
often
spoke
of
durl
and
duz
for
it
is
good
that
men
should
love
their
native
cities
and
the
little
hills
that
hold
those
cities
up
and
i
had
come
to
know
who
would
meet
them
when
they
returned
to
their
homes
and
where
they
thought
the
meetings
would
take
place
some
in
a
valley
of
the
acrotian
hills
where
the
road
comes
up
from
yann
others
in
the
gateway
of
one
or
another
of
the
three
cities
and
others
by
the
fireside
in
the
home
and
i
thought
of
the
danger
that
had
menaced
us
all
alike
outside
perdóndaris
a
danger
that
as
things
have
happened
was
very
real
and
i
thought
too
of
the
helmsman
cheery
song
in
the
cold
and
lonely
night
and
how
he
had
held
our
lives
in
his
careful
hands
and
as
i
thought
of
this
the
helmsman
ceased
to
sing
and
i
looked
up
and
saw
a
pale
light
had
appeared
in
the
sky
and
the
lonely
night
had
passed
and
the
dawn
widened
and
the
sailors
awoke
and
soon
we
saw
the
tide
of
the
sea
himself
advancing
resolute
between
yann
borders
and
yann
sprang
lithely
at
him
and
they
struggled
a
while
then
yann
and
all
that
was
his
were
pushed
back
northwards
so
that
the
sailors
had
to
hoist
the
sails
and
the
wind
being
favourable
we
still
held
onwards
and
we
passed
góndara
and
narl
and
hoz
and
we
saw
memorable
holy
golnuz
and
heard
the
pilgrims
praying
when
we
awoke
after
the
midday
rest
we
were
coming
near
to
nen
the
last
of
the
cities
in
the
river
yann
and
the
jungle
was
all
about
us
once
again
and
about
nen
but
the
great
mloon
ranges
stood
up
over
all
things
and
watched
the
city
from
beyond
the
jungle
here
we
anchored
and
the
captain
and
i
went
up
into
the
city
and
found
that
the
wanderers
had
come
into
nen
and
the
wanderers
were
a
weird
dark
tribe
that
once
in
every
seven
years
came
down
from
the
peaks
of
mloon
having
crossed
by
a
pass
that
is
known
to
them
from
some
fantastic
land
that
lies
beyond
and
the
people
of
nen
were
all
outside
their
houses
and
all
stood
wondering
at
their
own
streets
for
the
men
and
women
of
the
wanderers
had
crowded
all
the
ways
and
every
one
was
doing
some
strange
thing
some
danced
astounding
dances
that
they
had
learned
from
the
desert
wind
rapidly
curving
and
swirling
till
the
eye
could
follow
no
longer
others
played
upon
instruments
beautiful
wailing
tunes
that
were
full
of
horror
which
souls
had
taught
them
lost
by
night
in
the
desert
that
strange
far
desert
from
which
the
wanderers
came
none
of
their
instruments
were
such
as
were
known
in
nen
nor
in
any
part
of
the
region
of
the
yann
even
the
horns
out
of
which
some
were
made
were
of
beasts
that
none
had
seen
along
the
river
for
they
were
barbed
at
the
tips
and
they
sang
in
the
language
of
none
songs
that
seemed
to
be
akin
to
the
mysteries
of
night
and
to
the
unreasoned
fear
that
haunts
dark
places
bitterly
all
the
dogs
of
nen
distrusted
them
and
the
wanderers
told
one
another
fearful
tales
for
though
no
one
in
nen
knew
aught
of
their
language
yet
they
could
see
the
fear
on
the
listeners
faces
and
as
the
tale
wound
on
the
whites
of
their
eyes
showed
vividly
in
terror
as
the
eyes
of
some
little
beast
whom
the
hawk
has
seized
then
the
teller
of
the
tale
would
smile
and
stop
and
another
would
tell
his
story
and
the
teller
of
the
first
tale
lips
would
chatter
with
fear
and
if
some
deadly
snake
chanced
to
appear
the
wanderers
would
greet
him
like
a
brother
and
the
snake
would
seem
to
give
his
greetings
to
them
before
he
passed
on
again
once
that
most
fierce
and
lethal
of
tropic
snakes
the
giant
lythra
came
out
of
the
jungle
and
all
down
the
street
the
central
street
of
nen
and
none
of
the
wanderers
moved
away
from
him
but
they
all
played
sonorously
on
drums
as
though
he
had
been
a
person
of
much
honour
and
the
snake
moved
through
the
midst
of
them
and
smote
none
even
the
wanderers
children
could
do
strange
things
for
if
any
one
of
them
met
with
a
child
of
nen
the
two
would
stare
at
each
other
in
silence
with
large
grave
eyes
then
the
wanderers
child
would
slowly
draw
from
his
turban
a
live
fish
or
snake
and
the
children
of
nen
could
do
nothing
of
that
kind
at
all
much
i
should
have
wished
to
stay
and
hear
the
hymn
with
which
they
greet
the
night
that
is
answered
by
the
wolves
on
the
heights
of
mloon
but
it
was
now
time
to
raise
the
anchor
again
that
the
captain
might
return
from
upon
the
landward
tide
so
we
went
on
board
and
continued
down
the
yann
and
the
captain
and
i
spoke
little
for
we
were
thinking
of
our
parting
which
should
be
for
long
and
we
watched
instead
the
splendour
of
the
westerning
sun
for
the
sun
was
a
ruddy
gold
but
a
faint
mist
cloaked
the
jungle
lying
low
and
into
it
poured
the
smoke
of
the
little
jungle
cities
and
the
smoke
of
them
met
together
in
the
mist
and
joined
into
one
haze
which
became
purple
and
was
lit
by
the
sun
as
the
thoughts
of
men
become
hallowed
by
some
great
and
sacred
thing
sometimes
one
column
from
a
lonely
house
would
rise
up
higher
than
the
cities
smoke
and
gleam
by
itself
in
the
sun
and
now
as
the
sun
last
rays
were
nearly
level
we
saw
the
sight
that
i
had
come
to
see
for
from
two
mountains
that
stood
on
either
shore
two
cliffs
of
pink
marble
came
out
into
the
river
all
glowing
in
the
light
of
the
low
sun
and
they
were
quite
smooth
and
of
mountainous
altitude
and
they
nearly
met
and
yann
went
tumbling
between
them
and
found
the
sea
and
this
was
the
gate
of
yann
and
in
the
distance
through
that
barrier
gap
i
saw
the
azure
indescribable
sea
where
little
went
gleaming
by
and
the
sunset
and
the
brief
twilight
came
and
the
exultation
of
the
glory
of
was
gone
yet
still
the
pink
cliffs
glowed
the
fairest
marvel
that
the
eye
this
in
a
land
of
wonders
and
soon
the
twilight
gave
place
to
the
coming
out
of
stars
and
the
colours
of
went
dwindling
away
and
the
sight
of
those
cliffs
was
to
me
as
some
chord
of
music
that
a
master
hand
had
launched
from
the
violin
and
which
carries
to
heaven
of
faëry
the
tremulous
spirits
of
men
and
now
by
the
shore
they
anchored
and
went
no
farther
for
they
were
sailors
of
the
river
and
not
of
the
sea
and
knew
the
yann
but
not
the
tides
beyond
and
the
time
was
come
when
the
captain
and
i
must
part
he
to
go
back
again
to
his
fair
belzoond
in
sight
of
the
distant
peaks
of
the
hian
min
and
i
to
find
my
way
by
strange
means
back
to
those
hazy
fields
that
all
poets
know
wherein
stand
small
mysterious
cottages
through
whose
windows
looking
westwards
you
may
see
the
fields
of
men
and
looking
eastwards
see
glittering
elfin
mountains
tipped
with
snow
going
range
on
range
into
the
region
of
myth
and
beyond
it
into
the
kingdom
of
fantasy
which
pertain
to
the
lands
of
dream
long
we
should
meet
no
more
for
my
fancy
is
weakening
as
the
years
slip
by
and
i
go
ever
more
seldom
into
the
lands
of
dream
then
we
clasped
hands
uncouthly
on
his
part
for
it
is
not
the
method
of
greeting
in
his
country
and
he
commended
my
soul
to
the
care
of
his
own
gods
to
his
little
lesser
gods
the
humble
ones
to
the
gods
that
bless
belzoond
a
shop
in
street
i
said
i
must
go
back
to
yann
again
and
see
if
of
the
still
plies
up
and
down
and
whether
her
bearded
captain
commands
her
still
or
whether
he
sits
in
the
gate
of
fair
belzoond
drinking
at
evening
the
marvellous
yellow
wine
that
the
mountaineer
brings
down
from
the
hian
min
and
i
wanted
to
see
the
sailors
again
who
came
from
durl
and
duz
and
to
hear
from
their
lips
what
befell
perdóndaris
when
its
doom
came
up
without
warning
from
the
hills
and
fell
on
that
famous
city
and
i
wanted
to
hear
the
sailors
pray
at
night
each
to
his
own
god
and
to
feel
the
wind
of
the
evening
coolly
arise
when
the
sun
went
flaming
away
from
that
exotic
river
for
i
thought
never
again
to
see
the
tide
of
yann
but
when
i
gave
up
politics
not
long
ago
the
wings
of
my
fancy
strengthened
though
they
had
erstwhile
drooped
and
i
had
hopes
of
coming
behind
the
east
once
more
where
yann
like
a
proud
white
goes
through
the
lands
of
dream
yet
i
had
forgotten
the
way
to
those
little
cottages
on
the
edge
of
the
fields
we
know
whose
upper
windows
though
dim
with
antique
cobwebs
look
out
on
the
fields
we
know
not
and
are
the
of
all
adventure
in
all
the
lands
of
dream
i
therefore
made
enquiries
and
so
i
came
to
be
directed
to
the
shop
of
a
dreamer
who
lives
not
far
from
the
embankment
in
the
city
among
so
many
streets
as
there
are
in
the
city
it
is
little
wonder
that
there
is
one
that
has
never
been
seen
before
it
is
named
street
and
runs
out
of
the
strand
if
you
look
very
closely
now
when
you
enter
this
man
shop
you
do
not
go
straight
to
the
point
but
you
ask
him
to
sell
you
something
and
if
it
is
anything
with
which
he
can
supply
you
he
hands
it
you
and
wishes
you
it
is
his
way
and
many
have
been
deceived
by
asking
for
some
unlikely
thing
such
as
the
from
which
was
taken
one
of
those
single
pearls
that
made
the
gates
of
heaven
in
revelations
and
finding
that
the
old
man
had
it
in
stock
he
was
comatose
when
i
went
into
the
shop
his
heavy
lids
almost
covered
his
little
eyes
he
sat
and
his
mouth
was
open
i
said
i
want
some
of
abama
and
pharpah
rivers
of
damascus
how
much
he
said
two
and
a
half
yards
of
each
to
be
delivered
to
my
flat
that
is
very
tiresome
he
muttered
very
tiresome
we
do
not
stock
it
in
that
quantity
then
i
will
take
all
you
have
i
said
he
rose
laboriously
and
looked
among
some
bottles
i
saw
one
labelled
nilos
river
of
ægyptos
and
others
holy
ganges
phlegethon
jordan
i
was
almost
afraid
he
had
it
when
i
heard
him
mutter
again
this
is
very
tiresome
and
presently
he
said
we
are
out
of
it
then
i
said
i
wish
you
to
tell
me
the
way
to
those
little
cottages
in
whose
upper
chambers
poets
look
out
upon
the
fields
we
know
not
for
i
wish
to
go
into
the
land
of
dream
and
to
sail
once
more
upon
mighty
yann
at
that
he
moved
heavily
and
slowly
in
carpet
slippers
panting
as
he
went
to
the
back
part
of
his
shop
and
i
went
with
him
this
was
a
dingy
full
of
idols
the
near
end
was
dingy
and
dark
but
at
the
far
end
was
a
blue
cærulean
glow
in
which
stars
seemed
to
be
shining
and
the
heads
of
the
idols
glowed
this
said
the
fat
old
man
in
carpet
slippers
is
the
heaven
of
the
gods
who
sleep
i
asked
him
what
gods
slept
and
he
mentioned
names
that
i
had
never
heard
as
well
as
names
that
i
knew
all
those
he
said
that
are
not
worshipped
now
are
asleep
then
does
time
not
kill
the
gods
i
said
to
him
and
he
answered
no
but
for
three
or
four
thousand
years
a
god
is
worshipped
and
for
three
or
four
he
sleeps
only
time
is
wakeful
always
but
they
that
teach
us
of
new
gods
i
said
to
him
are
they
not
new
they
hear
the
old
ones
stirring
in
their
sleep
being
about
to
wake
because
the
dawn
is
breaking
and
the
priests
crow
these
are
the
happy
prophets
unhappy
are
they
that
hear
some
old
god
speak
while
he
sleeps
still
being
deep
in
slumber
and
prophesy
and
prophesy
and
no
dawn
comes
they
are
those
that
men
stone
saying
where
this
stone
shall
hit
you
and
this
then
shall
time
never
slay
the
gods
i
said
and
he
answered
they
shall
die
by
the
bedside
of
the
last
man
then
time
shall
go
mad
in
his
solitude
and
shall
not
know
his
hours
from
his
centuries
of
years
and
they
shall
clamour
round
him
crying
for
recognition
and
he
shall
lay
his
stricken
hands
on
their
heads
and
stare
at
them
blindly
and
say
children
i
do
not
know
you
one
from
another
and
at
these
words
of
time
empty
worlds
shall
reel
and
for
some
while
then
i
was
silent
for
my
imagination
went
out
into
those
far
years
and
looked
back
at
me
and
mocked
me
because
i
was
the
creature
of
a
day
suddenly
i
was
aware
by
the
old
man
heavy
breathing
that
he
had
gone
to
sleep
it
was
not
an
ordinary
shop
i
feared
lest
one
of
his
gods
should
wake
and
call
for
him
i
feared
many
things
it
was
so
dark
and
one
or
two
of
those
idols
were
something
more
than
grotesque
i
shook
the
old
man
hard
by
one
of
his
arms
tell
me
the
way
to
the
cottages
i
said
on
the
edge
of
the
fields
we
know
i
do
think
we
can
do
that
he
said
then
supply
me
i
said
with
the
goods
that
brought
him
to
his
senses
he
said
you
go
out
by
the
back
door
and
turn
to
the
right
and
he
opened
a
little
old
dark
door
in
the
wall
through
which
i
went
and
he
wheezed
and
shut
the
door
the
back
of
the
shop
was
of
incredible
age
i
saw
in
antique
characters
upon
a
mouldering
board
licensed
to
sell
weasels
and
jade
earrings
the
sun
was
setting
now
and
shone
on
little
golden
spires
that
gleamed
along
the
roof
which
had
long
ago
been
thatched
and
with
a
wonderful
straw
i
saw
that
the
whole
of
street
had
the
same
strange
appearance
when
looked
at
from
behind
the
pavement
was
the
same
as
the
pavement
of
which
i
was
weary
and
of
which
so
many
thousand
miles
lay
the
other
side
of
those
houses
but
the
street
was
of
most
pure
untrampled
grass
with
such
marvellous
flowers
in
it
that
they
lured
downward
from
great
heights
the
flocks
of
butterflies
as
they
traveled
by
going
i
know
not
whence
the
other
side
of
the
street
there
was
pavement
again
but
no
houses
of
any
kind
and
what
there
was
in
place
of
them
i
did
not
stop
to
see
for
i
turned
to
my
right
and
walked
along
the
back
of
street
till
i
came
to
the
open
fields
and
the
gardens
of
the
cottages
that
i
sought
huge
flowers
went
up
out
of
these
gardens
like
slow
rockets
and
burst
into
purple
blooms
and
stood
there
huge
and
radiant
on
stalks
and
softly
sang
strange
songs
others
came
up
beside
them
and
bloomed
and
began
singing
too
a
very
old
witch
came
out
of
her
cottage
by
the
back
door
and
into
the
garden
in
which
i
stood
what
are
these
wonderful
flowers
i
said
to
her
hush
hush
she
said
i
am
putting
the
poets
to
bed
these
flowers
are
their
dreams
and
in
a
lower
voice
i
said
what
wonderful
songs
are
they
singing
and
she
said
be
still
and
listen
and
i
listened
and
found
they
were
singing
of
my
own
childhood
and
of
things
that
happened
there
so
far
away
that
i
had
quite
forgotten
them
till
i
heard
the
wonderful
song
why
is
the
song
so
faint
i
said
to
her
dead
voices
she
said
dead
voices
and
turned
back
again
to
her
cottage
saying
dead
voices
still
but
softly
for
fear
that
she
should
wake
the
poets
they
sleep
so
badly
while
they
live
she
said
i
stole
on
tiptoe
upstairs
to
the
little
room
from
whose
windows
looking
one
way
we
see
the
fields
we
know
and
looking
another
those
hilly
lands
that
i
sought
almost
i
feared
not
to
find
them
i
looked
at
once
toward
the
mountains
of
faëry
the
afterglow
of
the
sunset
flamed
on
them
their
avalanches
flashed
on
their
violet
slopes
coming
down
tremendous
from
emerald
peaks
of
ice
and
there
was
the
old
gap
in
the
hills
above
the
precipice
of
amethyst
whence
one
sees
the
lands
of
dream
all
was
still
in
the
room
where
the
poets
slept
when
i
came
quietly
down
the
old
witch
sat
by
a
table
with
a
lamp
knitting
a
splendid
cloak
of
gold
and
green
for
a
king
that
had
been
dead
a
thousand
years
is
it
any
use
i
said
to
the
king
that
is
dead
that
you
sit
and
knit
him
a
cloak
of
gold
and
green
who
knows
she
said
what
a
silly
question
to
ask
said
her
old
black
cat
who
lay
curled
by
the
fluttering
fire
already
the
stars
were
shining
on
that
romantic
land
when
i
closed
the
witch
door
already
the
were
mounting
guard
for
the
night
around
those
magical
cottages
i
turned
and
trudged
for
the
gap
in
the
mountains
already
when
i
arrived
some
colour
began
to
show
in
the
amethyst
precipice
below
the
gap
although
it
was
not
yet
morning
i
heard
a
rattling
and
sometimes
caught
a
flash
from
those
golden
dragons
far
away
below
me
that
are
the
triumph
of
the
goldsmiths
of
sirdoo
and
were
given
life
by
the
ritual
incantations
of
the
conjurer
amargrarn
on
the
edge
of
the
opposite
cliff
too
near
i
thought
for
safety
i
saw
the
ivory
palace
of
singanee
that
mighty
small
lights
appeared
in
windows
the
slaves
were
awake
and
beginning
with
heavy
eyelids
the
work
of
the
day
and
now
a
ray
of
sunlight
topped
the
world
others
than
i
must
describe
how
it
swept
from
the
amethyst
cliff
the
shadow
of
the
black
one
that
opposed
it
how
that
one
shaft
of
sunlight
pierced
the
amethyst
for
leagues
and
how
the
rejoicing
colour
leaped
up
to
welcome
the
light
and
shot
back
a
purple
glow
on
the
walls
of
the
palace
of
ivory
while
down
in
that
incredible
ravine
the
golden
dragons
still
played
in
the
darkness
at
this
moment
a
female
slave
came
out
by
a
door
of
the
palace
and
tossed
a
of
sapphires
over
the
edge
and
when
day
was
manifest
on
those
marvellous
heights
and
the
flare
of
the
amethyst
precipice
filled
the
abyss
then
the
arose
in
his
ivory
palace
and
took
his
terrific
spear
and
going
out
by
a
landward
door
went
forth
to
avenge
perdóndaris
i
turned
then
and
looked
upon
the
lands
of
dream
and
the
thin
white
mist
that
never
rolls
quite
away
was
shifting
in
the
morning
rising
like
isles
above
it
i
saw
the
hills
of
hap
and
the
city
of
copper
old
deserted
bethmoora
and
utnar
véhi
and
kyph
and
mandaroon
and
the
wandering
leagues
of
yann
rather
i
guessed
than
saw
the
hian
min
whose
imperturbable
and
aged
heads
scarce
recognize
for
more
than
clustered
mounds
the
round
acroctian
hills
that
are
heaped
about
their
feet
and
that
shelter
as
i
remembered
durl
and
duz
but
most
clearly
i
discerned
that
ancient
wood
through
which
one
going
down
to
the
bank
of
yann
whenever
the
moon
is
old
may
come
on
of
the
anchored
there
waiting
three
days
for
travellers
as
has
been
prophesied
of
her
and
as
it
was
now
that
season
i
hurried
down
from
the
gap
in
the
hills
by
an
elfin
path
that
was
coeval
with
fable
and
came
by
means
of
it
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
black
though
the
darkness
was
in
that
ancient
wood
the
beasts
that
moved
in
it
were
blacker
still
it
is
very
seldom
that
any
dreamer
travelling
in
lands
of
dream
is
ever
seized
by
these
beasts
and
yet
i
ran
for
if
a
spirit
is
seized
in
the
lands
of
dream
his
body
may
survive
it
for
many
years
and
well
know
the
beasts
that
mouthed
him
far
away
and
the
look
in
their
little
eyes
and
the
smell
of
their
breath
that
is
why
the
recreation
field
at
hanwell
is
so
dreadfully
trodden
into
restless
paths
and
so
i
came
at
last
to
the
flood
of
proud
tremendous
yann
with
whom
there
tumbled
streams
from
incredible
lands
with
these
he
went
by
singing
singing
he
carried
and
whole
trees
fallen
in
unvisited
forests
and
swept
them
mightily
by
but
no
sign
was
there
either
out
in
the
river
or
in
the
olden
anchorage
near
by
of
the
ship
i
came
to
see
and
i
built
myself
a
hut
and
roofed
it
over
with
the
huge
abundant
leaves
of
a
marvellous
weed
and
ate
the
meat
that
grows
on
the
and
waited
there
three
days
and
all
day
long
the
river
tumbled
by
and
all
night
long
the
sang
on
and
the
huge
fireflies
had
no
other
care
than
to
pour
past
in
torrents
of
dancing
sparks
and
nothing
rippled
the
surface
of
the
yann
by
day
and
nothing
disturbed
the
by
night
i
know
not
what
i
feared
for
the
ship
i
sought
and
its
friendly
captain
who
came
from
fair
belzoond
and
its
cheery
sailors
out
of
durl
and
duz
all
day
long
i
looked
for
it
on
the
river
and
listened
for
it
by
night
until
the
dancing
fireflies
danced
me
to
sleep
three
times
only
in
those
three
nights
the
was
scared
and
stopped
his
song
and
each
time
i
awoke
with
a
start
and
found
no
ship
and
saw
that
he
was
only
scared
by
the
dawn
those
indescribable
dawns
upon
the
yann
came
up
like
flames
in
some
land
over
the
hills
where
a
magician
burns
by
secret
means
enormous
amethysts
in
a
copper
pot
i
used
to
watch
them
in
wonder
while
no
bird
sang
till
all
of
a
sudden
the
sun
came
over
a
hill
and
every
bird
but
one
began
to
sing
and
the
slept
fast
till
out
of
an
opening
eye
he
saw
the
stars
i
would
have
waited
three
more
days
but
on
the
third
day
i
had
gone
in
my
loneliness
to
see
the
very
spot
where
first
i
met
of
the
at
her
anchorage
with
her
bearded
captain
sitting
on
the
deck
and
as
i
looked
at
the
black
mud
of
the
harbour
and
pictured
in
my
mind
that
band
of
sailors
whom
i
had
not
seen
for
two
years
i
saw
an
old
hulk
peeping
from
the
mud
the
lapse
of
centuries
seemed
partly
to
have
rotted
and
partly
to
have
buried
in
the
mud
all
but
the
prow
of
the
boat
and
on
the
prow
i
faintly
saw
a
name
i
read
it
slowly
it
was
of
the
and
then
i
knew
that
while
in
ireland
and
london
two
years
had
barely
passed
over
my
head
ages
had
gone
over
the
region
of
yann
and
wrecked
and
rotted
that
once
familiar
ship
and
buried
years
ago
the
bones
of
the
youngest
of
my
friends
who
so
often
sang
to
me
of
durl
and
duz
or
told
the
of
belzoond
for
beyond
the
world
we
know
there
roars
a
hurricane
of
centuries
whose
echo
only
troubles
though
sorely
our
fields
while
elsewhere
there
is
calm
i
stayed
a
moment
by
that
battered
hulk
and
said
a
prayer
for
whatever
may
be
immortal
of
those
who
were
wont
to
sail
it
down
the
yann
and
i
prayed
for
them
to
the
gods
to
whom
they
loved
to
pray
to
the
little
lesser
gods
that
bless
belzoond
then
leaving
the
hut
that
i
built
to
those
ravenous
years
i
turned
my
back
to
the
yann
and
entering
the
forest
at
evening
just
as
its
orchids
were
opening
their
petals
to
perfume
the
night
came
out
of
it
in
the
morning
and
passed
that
day
along
the
amethyst
gulf
by
the
gap
in
the
mountains
i
wondered
if
singanee
that
mighty
had
returned
again
with
his
spear
to
his
lofty
ivory
palace
or
if
his
doom
had
been
one
with
that
of
perdóndaris
i
saw
a
merchant
at
a
small
back
door
selling
new
sapphires
as
i
passed
the
palace
then
i
went
on
and
came
as
twilight
fell
to
those
small
cottages
where
the
elfin
mountains
are
in
sight
of
the
fields
we
know
and
i
went
to
the
old
witch
that
i
had
seen
before
and
she
sat
in
her
parlour
with
a
red
shawl
round
her
shoulders
still
knitting
the
golden
cloak
and
faintly
through
one
of
her
windows
the
elfin
mountains
shone
and
i
saw
again
through
another
the
fields
we
know
tell
me
something
i
said
of
this
strange
land
how
much
do
you
know
she
said
do
you
know
that
dreams
are
illusion
of
course
i
do
i
said
every
one
knows
that
oh
no
they
do
she
said
the
mad
do
know
it
that
is
true
i
said
and
do
you
know
she
said
that
life
is
illusion
of
course
it
is
not
i
said
life
is
real
life
is
earnest
at
that
the
witch
and
her
cat
who
had
not
moved
from
her
old
place
by
the
hearth
burst
into
laughter
i
stayed
some
time
for
there
was
much
that
i
wished
to
ask
but
when
i
saw
that
the
laughter
would
not
stop
i
turned
and
went
away
the
avenger
of
perdóndaris
i
was
rowing
on
the
thames
not
many
days
after
my
return
from
the
yann
and
drifting
eastwards
with
the
fall
of
the
tide
away
from
westminster
bridge
near
which
i
had
hired
my
boat
all
kinds
of
things
were
on
the
water
with
me
sticks
drifting
and
huge
boats
and
i
was
watching
so
absorbed
the
traffic
of
that
great
river
that
i
did
not
notice
i
had
come
to
the
city
until
i
looked
up
and
saw
that
part
of
the
embankment
that
is
nearest
to
street
and
then
i
suddenly
wondered
what
befell
singanee
for
there
was
a
stillness
about
his
ivory
palace
when
i
passed
it
by
which
made
me
think
that
he
had
not
then
returned
and
though
i
had
seen
him
go
forth
with
his
terrific
spear
and
mighty
though
he
was
yet
his
was
a
fearful
quest
for
i
knew
that
it
was
none
other
than
to
avenge
perdóndaris
by
slaying
that
monster
with
the
single
tusk
who
had
overthrown
it
suddenly
in
a
day
so
i
tied
up
my
boat
as
soon
as
i
came
to
some
steps
and
landed
and
left
the
embankment
and
about
the
third
street
i
came
to
i
began
to
look
for
the
opening
of
street
it
is
very
narrow
you
hardly
notice
it
at
first
but
there
it
was
and
soon
i
was
in
the
old
man
shop
but
a
young
man
leaned
over
the
counter
he
had
no
information
to
give
me
about
the
old
man
he
was
sufficient
in
himself
as
to
the
little
old
door
in
the
back
of
the
shop
we
know
nothing
about
that
sir
so
i
had
to
talk
to
him
and
humour
him
he
had
for
sale
on
the
counter
an
instrument
for
picking
up
a
lump
of
sugar
in
a
new
way
he
was
pleased
when
i
looked
at
it
and
he
began
to
praise
it
i
asked
him
what
was
the
use
of
it
and
he
said
that
it
was
of
no
use
but
that
it
had
only
been
invented
a
week
ago
and
was
quite
new
and
was
made
of
real
silver
and
was
being
very
much
bought
but
all
the
while
i
was
straying
towards
the
back
of
the
shop
when
i
enquired
about
the
idols
there
he
said
that
they
were
some
of
the
season
novelties
and
were
a
choice
selection
of
mascots
and
while
i
made
a
pretence
of
selecting
one
i
suddenly
saw
the
wonderful
old
door
i
was
through
it
at
once
and
the
young
after
me
no
one
was
more
surprised
than
he
when
he
saw
the
street
of
grass
and
the
purple
flowers
on
it
he
ran
across
in
his
on
to
the
opposite
pavement
and
only
just
stopped
in
time
for
the
world
ended
there
looking
downward
over
the
pavement
edge
he
saw
instead
of
accustomed
white
clouds
and
a
wide
blue
sky
i
led
him
to
the
old
back
door
of
the
shop
looking
pale
and
in
need
of
air
and
pushed
him
lightly
and
he
went
limply
through
for
i
thought
the
air
was
better
for
him
on
the
side
of
the
street
that
he
knew
as
soon
as
the
door
was
shut
on
that
astonished
man
i
turned
to
the
right
and
went
along
the
street
till
i
saw
the
gardens
and
the
cottages
and
a
little
red
patch
moving
in
a
garden
which
i
knew
to
be
the
old
witch
wearing
her
shawl
come
for
a
change
of
illusion
again
she
said
i
have
come
from
london
i
said
and
i
want
to
see
singanee
i
want
to
go
to
his
ivory
palace
over
the
elfin
mountains
where
the
amethyst
precipice
is
nothing
like
changing
your
illusions
she
said
or
you
grow
tired
london
a
fine
place
but
one
wants
to
see
the
elfin
mountains
sometimes
then
you
know
london
i
said
of
course
i
do
she
said
i
can
dream
as
well
as
you
you
are
not
the
only
person
that
can
imagine
london
men
were
toiling
dreadfully
in
her
garden
it
was
in
the
heat
of
the
day
and
they
were
digging
with
spades
she
suddenly
turned
from
me
to
beat
one
of
them
over
the
back
with
a
long
black
stick
that
she
carried
even
my
poets
go
to
london
sometimes
she
said
to
me
why
did
you
beat
that
man
i
said
to
make
him
work
she
answered
but
he
is
tired
i
said
of
course
he
is
said
she
and
i
looked
and
saw
that
the
earth
was
difficult
and
dry
and
that
every
spadeful
that
the
tired
men
lifted
was
full
of
pearls
but
some
men
sat
quite
still
and
watched
the
butterflies
that
flitted
about
the
garden
and
the
old
witch
did
not
beat
them
with
her
stick
and
when
i
asked
her
who
the
diggers
were
she
said
these
are
my
poets
they
are
digging
for
pearls
and
when
i
asked
her
what
so
many
pearls
were
for
she
said
to
me
to
feed
the
pigs
of
course
but
do
the
pigs
like
pearls
i
said
to
her
of
course
they
do
she
said
and
i
would
have
pressed
the
matter
further
but
the
old
black
cat
had
come
out
of
the
cottage
and
was
looking
at
me
whimsically
and
saying
nothing
so
that
i
knew
i
was
asking
silly
questions
and
i
asked
instead
why
some
of
the
poets
were
idle
and
were
watching
butterflies
without
being
beaten
and
she
said
the
butterflies
know
where
the
pearls
are
hidden
and
they
are
waiting
for
one
to
alight
above
the
buried
treasure
they
can
not
dig
until
they
know
where
to
dig
and
all
of
a
sudden
a
faun
came
out
of
a
rhododendron
forest
and
began
to
dance
upon
a
disk
of
bronze
in
which
a
fountain
was
set
and
the
sound
of
his
two
hooves
dancing
on
the
bronze
was
beautiful
as
bells
said
the
witch
and
all
the
poets
threw
down
their
spades
and
followed
her
into
the
house
and
i
followed
them
but
the
witch
and
all
of
us
followed
the
black
cat
who
arched
his
back
and
lifted
his
tail
and
walked
along
the
of
blue
enamelled
tiles
and
through
the
porch
and
the
open
oaken
door
and
into
a
little
room
where
tea
was
ready
and
in
the
garden
the
flowers
began
to
sing
and
the
fountain
tinkled
on
the
disk
of
bronze
and
i
learned
that
the
fountain
came
from
an
otherwise
unknown
sea
and
sometimes
it
threw
gilded
fragments
up
from
the
wrecks
of
galleons
foundered
in
storms
of
some
sea
that
was
nowhere
in
the
world
or
battered
to
bits
in
wars
waged
with
we
know
not
whom
some
said
that
it
was
salt
because
of
the
sea
and
others
that
it
was
salt
with
mariners
tears
and
some
of
the
poets
took
large
flowers
out
of
vases
and
threw
their
petals
all
about
the
room
and
others
talked
two
at
a
time
and
other
sang
why
they
are
only
children
after
all
i
said
only
children
repeated
the
old
witch
who
was
pouring
out
cowslip
wine
children
said
the
old
black
cat
and
every
one
laughed
at
me
i
sincerely
apologize
i
said
i
did
not
mean
to
say
it
i
did
not
intend
to
insult
any
one
why
he
knows
nothing
at
all
said
the
old
black
cat
and
everybody
laughed
till
the
poets
were
put
to
bed
and
then
i
took
one
look
at
the
fields
we
know
and
turned
to
the
other
window
that
looks
on
the
elfin
mountains
and
the
evening
looked
like
a
sapphire
and
i
saw
my
way
though
the
fields
were
growing
dim
and
when
i
found
it
i
went
downstairs
and
through
the
witch
parlour
and
out
of
doors
and
came
that
night
to
the
palace
of
singanee
lights
glittered
through
every
crystal
slab
and
all
were
uncurtained
in
the
palace
of
ivory
the
sounds
were
those
of
a
triumphant
dance
very
haunting
indeed
was
the
booming
of
a
bassoon
and
like
the
dangerous
advance
of
some
galloping
beast
were
the
blows
wielded
by
a
powerful
man
on
the
huge
sonourous
drum
it
seemed
to
me
as
i
listened
that
the
contest
of
singanee
with
the
more
than
elephantine
destroyer
of
perdóndaris
had
already
been
set
to
music
and
as
i
walked
in
the
dark
along
the
amethyst
precipice
i
suddenly
saw
across
it
a
curved
white
bridge
it
was
one
ivory
tusk
and
i
knew
it
for
the
triumph
of
singanee
i
knew
at
once
that
this
curved
mass
of
ivory
that
had
been
dragged
by
ropes
to
bridge
the
abyss
was
the
twin
of
the
ivory
gate
that
once
perdóndaris
had
and
had
itself
been
the
destruction
of
that
once
famous
city
towers
and
walls
and
people
already
men
had
begun
to
hollow
it
and
to
carve
human
figures
along
its
sides
i
walked
across
it
and
half
way
across
at
the
bottom
of
the
curve
i
met
a
few
of
the
carvers
fast
asleep
on
the
opposite
cliff
by
the
palace
lay
the
thickest
end
of
the
tusk
and
i
came
down
a
ladder
which
leaned
against
the
tusk
for
they
had
not
yet
carved
steps
outside
the
ivory
palace
it
was
as
i
had
supposed
and
the
sentry
at
the
gate
slept
heavily
and
though
i
asked
of
him
permission
to
enter
the
palace
he
only
muttered
a
blessing
on
singanee
and
fell
asleep
again
it
was
evident
that
he
had
been
drinking
bak
inside
the
ivory
hall
i
met
with
servitors
who
told
me
that
any
stranger
was
welcome
there
that
night
because
they
extolled
the
triumph
of
singanee
and
they
offered
me
bak
to
drink
to
commemorate
the
splendour
but
i
did
not
know
its
power
nor
whether
a
little
or
much
prevailed
over
a
man
so
i
said
that
i
was
under
an
oath
to
a
god
to
drink
nothing
beautiful
and
they
asked
me
if
he
could
not
be
appeased
by
a
prayer
and
i
said
in
nowise
and
went
towards
the
dance
and
they
commiserated
me
and
abused
that
god
bitterly
thinking
to
please
me
thereby
and
then
they
fell
to
drinking
bak
to
the
glory
of
singanee
outside
the
curtains
that
hung
before
the
dance
there
stood
a
chamberlain
and
when
i
told
him
that
though
a
stranger
there
yet
i
was
well
known
to
mung
and
sish
and
kib
the
gods
of
pegana
whose
signs
i
made
he
bade
me
ample
welcome
therefore
i
questioned
him
about
my
clothes
asking
if
they
were
not
unsuitable
to
so
august
an
occasion
and
he
swore
by
the
spear
that
had
slain
the
destroyer
of
perdóndaris
that
singanee
would
think
it
a
shameful
thing
that
any
stranger
not
unknown
to
the
gods
should
enter
the
dancing
hall
unsuitably
clad
and
therefore
he
led
me
to
another
room
and
took
silken
robes
out
of
an
old
of
black
and
seamy
oak
with
green
copper
hasps
that
were
set
with
a
few
pale
sapphires
and
requested
me
to
choose
a
suitable
robe
and
i
chose
a
bright
green
robe
with
an
of
light
blue
which
was
seen
here
and
there
and
a
light
blue
i
also
wore
a
cloak
that
was
dark
purple
with
two
thin
strips
of
along
the
border
and
a
row
of
large
dark
sapphires
sewn
along
the
purple
between
them
it
hung
down
from
my
shoulders
behind
me
nor
would
the
chamberlain
of
singanee
let
me
take
any
less
than
this
for
he
said
that
not
even
a
stranger
on
that
night
could
be
allowed
to
stand
in
the
way
of
his
munificence
which
he
was
pleased
to
exercise
in
honour
of
his
victory
as
soon
as
i
was
attired
we
went
to
the
dancing
hall
and
the
first
thing
that
i
saw
in
that
tall
scintillant
chamber
was
the
huge
form
of
singanee
standing
among
the
dancers
and
the
heads
of
the
men
no
higher
than
his
waist
bare
were
the
huge
arms
that
had
held
the
spear
that
had
avenged
perdóndaris
the
chamberlain
led
me
to
him
and
i
bowed
and
said
that
i
gave
thanks
to
the
gods
to
whom
he
looked
for
protection
and
he
said
that
he
had
heard
my
gods
well
spoken
of
by
those
accustomed
to
pray
but
this
he
said
only
of
courtesy
for
he
knew
not
whom
they
were
singanee
was
simply
dressed
and
only
wore
on
his
head
a
plain
gold
band
to
keep
his
hair
from
falling
over
his
forehead
the
ends
of
the
gold
were
tied
in
the
back
with
a
bow
of
purple
silk
but
all
his
queens
wore
crowns
of
great
magnificence
though
whether
they
were
crowned
as
the
queens
of
singanee
or
whether
queens
were
attracted
there
from
the
thrones
of
distant
lands
by
the
wonder
of
him
and
the
splendour
i
did
not
know
all
there
wore
silken
robes
of
brilliant
colours
and
the
feet
of
all
were
bare
and
very
shapely
for
the
custom
of
boots
was
unknown
in
those
regions
and
when
they
saw
that
my
big
toes
were
deformed
in
the
manner
of
europeans
turning
inwards
towards
the
others
instead
of
being
straight
one
or
two
asked
sympathetically
if
an
accident
had
befallen
me
and
rather
than
tell
them
truly
that
deforming
out
big
toes
was
our
custom
and
our
pleasure
i
told
them
that
i
was
under
the
curse
of
a
malignant
god
at
whose
feet
i
had
neglected
to
offer
berries
in
infancy
and
to
some
extent
i
justified
myself
for
convention
is
a
god
though
his
ways
are
evil
and
had
i
told
them
the
truth
i
would
not
have
been
understood
they
gave
me
a
lady
to
dance
with
who
was
of
marvellous
beauty
she
gold
me
that
her
name
was
saranoora
a
princess
from
the
north
who
had
been
sent
as
tribute
to
the
palace
of
singanee
and
partly
she
danced
as
europeans
dance
and
partly
as
the
fairies
of
the
waste
who
lure
as
legend
has
it
lost
travellers
to
their
doom
and
if
i
could
get
thirty
heathen
men
out
of
fantastic
lands
with
their
long
black
hair
and
little
elfin
eyes
and
instruments
of
music
even
unknown
to
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
and
if
i
could
make
them
play
those
tunes
that
i
heard
in
the
ivory
palace
on
some
lawn
gentle
reader
at
evening
near
your
house
then
you
would
understand
the
beauty
of
saranoora
and
the
blaze
of
light
and
colour
in
that
stupendous
hall
and
the
lithesome
movement
of
those
mysterious
queens
that
danced
round
singanee
then
gentle
reader
you
would
be
gentle
no
more
but
the
thoughts
that
run
like
leopards
over
the
far
free
lands
would
come
leaping
into
your
head
even
were
it
london
yes
even
in
london
you
would
rise
up
then
and
beat
your
hands
on
the
wall
with
its
pretty
pattern
of
flowers
in
the
hope
that
the
bricks
might
break
and
reveal
the
way
to
that
palace
of
ivory
by
the
amethyst
gulf
where
the
golden
dragons
are
for
there
have
been
men
who
have
burned
prisons
down
that
the
prisoners
might
escape
and
even
such
incendiaries
those
dark
musicians
are
who
dangerously
burn
down
custom
that
the
pining
thoughts
may
go
free
let
your
elders
have
no
fear
have
no
fear
i
will
not
play
those
tunes
in
any
streets
we
know
i
will
not
bring
those
strange
musicians
here
i
will
only
whisper
the
way
to
the
lands
of
dream
and
only
a
few
frail
feet
shall
find
the
way
and
i
shall
dream
alone
of
the
beauty
of
saranoora
and
sometimes
sigh
we
danced
on
and
on
at
the
will
of
the
thirty
musicians
but
when
the
stars
were
paling
and
the
wind
that
knew
the
dawn
was
ruffling
up
the
edge
of
the
skirts
of
night
then
saranoora
the
princess
of
the
north
led
me
out
into
a
garden
dark
groves
of
trees
were
there
which
filled
the
night
with
perfume
and
guarded
mysteries
from
the
arising
dawn
there
floated
over
us
wandering
in
that
garden
the
triumphant
melody
of
those
dark
musicians
whose
origin
was
unguessed
even
by
those
that
dwelt
there
and
knew
the
lands
of
dream
for
only
a
moment
once
sang
the
for
the
festival
of
that
night
had
scared
him
and
he
was
silent
for
only
a
moment
once
we
heard
him
singing
in
some
far
grove
because
the
musicians
rested
and
our
bare
feet
made
no
sound
for
a
moment
we
heard
that
bird
of
which
once
our
nightingale
dreamed
and
handed
on
the
tradition
to
his
children
and
saranoora
told
me
that
they
have
named
the
bird
the
sister
of
song
but
for
the
musicians
who
presently
played
again
she
said
they
had
no
name
for
no
one
knew
who
they
were
or
from
what
country
then
some
one
sang
quite
near
us
in
the
darkness
to
an
instrument
of
strings
telling
of
singanee
and
his
battle
against
the
monster
and
soon
we
saw
him
sitting
on
the
ground
and
singing
to
the
night
of
that
that
had
found
the
thumping
heart
of
the
destroyer
of
perdóndaris
and
we
stopped
awhile
and
asked
him
who
had
seen
so
memorable
a
struggle
and
he
answered
none
but
singanee
and
he
whose
tusk
had
scattered
perdóndaris
and
now
the
last
was
dead
and
when
we
asked
him
if
singanee
had
told
him
of
the
struggle
he
said
that
that
proud
hunter
would
say
no
word
about
it
and
that
therefore
his
mighty
deed
was
given
to
the
poets
and
become
their
trust
forever
and
he
struck
again
his
instrument
of
strings
and
sang
on
when
the
strings
of
pearls
that
hung
down
from
her
neck
began
to
gleam
all
over
saranoora
i
knew
that
dawn
was
near
and
that
that
memorable
night
was
all
but
gone
and
at
last
we
left
the
garden
and
came
to
the
abyss
to
see
the
sunrise
shine
on
the
amethyst
cliff
and
at
first
it
lit
up
the
beauty
of
saranoora
and
then
it
topped
the
world
and
blazed
upon
those
cliffs
of
amethyst
until
it
dazzled
our
eyes
and
we
turned
from
it
and
saw
the
workman
going
out
along
the
tusk
to
hollow
it
and
to
carve
a
balustrade
of
fair
professional
figures
and
those
who
had
drunken
bak
began
to
awake
and
to
open
their
dazzled
eyes
at
the
amethyst
precipice
and
to
rub
them
and
turn
them
away
and
now
those
wonderful
kingdoms
of
song
that
the
dark
musicians
established
all
night
by
magical
chords
dropped
back
again
to
the
sway
of
that
ancient
silence
who
ruled
before
the
gods
and
the
musicians
wrapped
their
cloaks
about
them
and
covered
up
their
marvellous
instruments
and
stole
away
to
the
plains
and
no
one
dared
ask
them
whither
they
went
or
why
they
dwelt
there
or
what
god
they
served
and
the
dance
stopped
and
all
the
queens
departed
and
then
the
female
slave
came
out
again
by
a
door
and
emptied
her
basket
of
sapphires
down
the
abyss
as
i
saw
her
do
before
beautiful
saranoora
said
that
those
great
queens
would
never
wear
their
sapphires
more
than
once
and
that
every
day
at
noon
a
merchant
from
the
mountains
sold
new
ones
for
that
evening
yet
i
suspected
that
something
more
than
extravagance
lay
at
the
back
of
that
seemingly
wasteful
act
of
tossing
sapphires
into
an
abyss
for
thee
were
in
the
depths
of
it
those
two
dragons
of
gold
of
whom
nothing
seemed
to
be
known
and
i
thought
and
i
think
so
still
that
singanee
terrific
though
he
was
in
war
with
the
elephants
from
whose
tusks
he
had
built
his
palace
well
knew
and
even
feared
those
dragons
in
the
abyss
and
perhaps
valued
those
priceless
jewels
less
than
he
valued
his
queens
and
that
he
to
whom
so
many
lands
paid
beautiful
tribute
out
of
their
dread
of
his
spear
himself
paid
tribute
to
the
golden
dragons
whether
those
dragons
had
wings
i
could
not
see
nor
if
they
had
could
i
tell
if
they
could
bear
that
weight
of
solid
gold
from
the
abyss
nor
by
what
paths
they
could
crawl
from
it
did
i
know
and
i
know
not
what
use
to
a
golden
dragon
should
sapphires
be
or
a
queen
only
it
seemed
strange
to
me
that
so
much
wealth
of
jewels
should
be
thrown
by
command
of
a
man
who
had
nothing
to
fear
to
fall
flashing
and
changing
their
colours
at
dawn
into
an
abyss
i
do
not
know
how
long
we
lingered
there
watching
the
sunrise
on
those
miles
of
amethyst
and
it
is
strange
that
that
great
and
famous
wonder
did
not
move
me
more
than
it
did
but
my
mind
was
dazzled
by
the
fame
of
it
and
my
eyes
were
actually
dazzled
by
the
blaze
and
as
often
happens
i
thought
more
of
little
things
and
remember
watching
the
daylight
in
the
solitary
sapphire
that
saranoora
had
and
that
she
wore
upon
her
finger
in
a
ring
then
the
dawn
wind
being
all
about
her
she
said
that
she
was
cold
and
turned
back
into
the
ivory
palace
and
i
feared
that
we
might
never
meet
again
for
time
moves
differently
over
the
lands
of
dream
than
over
the
fields
we
know
like
going
different
ways
and
bearing
drifting
ships
and
at
the
doorway
of
the
ivory
palace
i
turned
to
say
farewell
and
yet
i
found
no
words
that
were
suitable
to
say
and
often
now
when
i
stand
in
other
lands
i
stop
and
think
of
many
things
to
have
said
yet
all
i
said
was
perhaps
we
shall
meet
again
and
she
said
that
it
was
likely
that
we
should
often
meet
for
that
this
was
a
little
thing
for
the
gods
to
permit
not
knowing
that
the
gods
of
the
lands
of
dream
have
little
power
upon
the
fields
we
know
then
she
went
in
through
the
doorway
and
having
exchanged
for
my
own
clothes
again
the
raiment
that
the
chamberlain
had
given
me
i
turned
from
the
hospitality
of
mighty
singanee
and
set
my
face
towards
the
fields
we
know
i
crossed
that
enormous
tusk
that
had
been
the
end
of
perdóndaris
and
met
the
artists
carving
it
as
i
went
and
some
by
way
of
greeting
as
i
passed
extolled
singanee
and
in
answer
i
gave
honour
to
his
name
daylight
had
not
yet
penetrated
wholly
to
the
bottom
of
the
abyss
but
the
darkness
was
giving
place
to
a
purple
haze
and
i
could
faintly
see
one
golden
dragon
there
then
looking
once
towards
the
ivory
palace
and
seeing
no
one
at
the
windows
i
turned
sorrowfully
away
and
going
by
the
way
that
i
knew
passed
through
the
gap
in
the
mountains
and
down
their
slopes
till
i
came
again
in
sight
of
the
witch
cottage
and
as
i
went
to
the
upper
window
to
look
for
the
fields
we
know
the
witch
spoke
to
me
but
i
was
cross
as
one
newly
waked
from
sleep
and
i
would
not
answer
her
then
the
cat
questioned
me
as
to
whom
i
had
met
and
i
answered
him
that
in
the
fields
we
know
cats
kept
their
place
and
did
not
speak
to
man
and
then
i
came
downstairs
and
walked
straight
out
of
the
door
heading
for
street
you
are
going
the
wrong
way
the
witch
called
through
the
window
and
indeed
i
had
sooner
gone
back
to
the
ivory
palace
again
but
i
had
no
right
to
trespass
any
further
on
the
hospitality
of
singanee
and
one
can
not
stay
always
in
the
lands
of
dream
and
what
knowledge
had
that
old
witch
of
the
call
of
the
fields
we
know
or
the
little
though
many
snares
that
bind
our
feet
therein
so
i
paid
no
heed
to
her
but
kept
on
and
came
to
street
i
saw
the
house
with
the
green
door
some
way
up
the
street
but
thinking
that
the
near
end
of
the
street
was
closer
to
the
embankment
where
i
had
left
my
boat
i
tried
the
first
door
i
came
to
a
cottage
thatched
like
the
rest
with
little
golden
spires
along
the
and
strange
birds
sitting
there
and
preening
marvellous
feathers
the
door
opened
and
to
my
surprise
i
found
myself
in
what
seemed
like
a
shepherd
cottage
a
man
who
was
sitting
on
a
log
of
wood
in
a
little
low
dark
room
said
something
to
me
in
an
alien
language
i
muttered
something
and
hurried
through
to
the
street
the
house
was
thatched
in
front
as
well
as
behind
there
were
not
golden
spires
in
front
no
marvellous
birds
but
there
was
no
pavement
there
was
a
row
of
houses
byres
and
barns
but
no
other
sign
of
a
town
far
off
i
saw
one
or
two
little
villages
yet
there
was
the
river
and
no
doubt
the
thames
for
it
was
the
width
of
the
thames
and
had
the
curves
of
it
if
you
can
imagine
the
thames
in
that
particular
spot
without
a
city
around
it
without
any
bridges
and
the
embankment
fallen
in
i
saw
that
there
had
happened
to
me
permanently
and
in
the
light
of
day
some
such
thing
as
happens
to
a
man
but
to
a
child
more
often
when
he
awakes
before
morning
in
some
strange
room
and
sees
a
high
grey
window
where
the
door
ought
to
be
and
unfamiliar
objects
in
wrong
places
and
though
knowing
where
he
is
yet
knows
not
how
it
can
be
that
the
place
should
look
like
that
a
flock
of
sheep
came
by
me
presently
looking
the
same
as
ever
but
the
man
who
led
them
had
a
wild
strange
look
i
spoke
to
him
and
he
did
not
understand
me
then
i
went
down
to
the
river
to
see
if
my
boat
was
there
and
at
the
very
spot
where
i
had
left
it
in
the
mud
for
the
tide
was
low
i
saw
a
piece
of
blackened
wood
that
might
have
been
part
of
a
boat
but
i
could
not
tell
i
began
to
feel
that
i
had
missed
the
world
it
would
be
a
strange
thing
to
travel
from
far
away
to
see
london
and
not
be
able
to
find
it
among
all
the
roads
that
lead
there
but
i
seemed
to
have
travelled
in
time
and
to
have
missed
it
among
the
centuries
and
when
as
i
wandered
over
the
grassy
hills
i
came
on
a
wattled
shrine
that
was
thatched
with
straw
and
saw
a
lion
in
it
more
worn
with
time
than
even
the
sphinx
at
gizeh
and
when
i
knew
it
for
one
of
the
four
in
trafalgar
square
then
i
saw
that
i
was
stranded
far
away
in
the
future
with
many
centuries
of
treacherous
years
between
me
and
anything
that
i
had
known
and
then
i
sat
on
the
grass
by
the
worn
paws
of
the
lion
to
think
out
what
to
do
and
i
decided
to
go
back
through
street
and
since
there
was
nothing
left
to
keep
me
any
more
to
the
fields
we
know
to
offer
myself
as
a
servant
in
the
palace
of
singanee
and
to
see
again
the
face
of
saranoora
and
those
famous
wonderful
amethystine
dawns
upon
the
abyss
where
the
golden
dragons
play
and
i
stayed
no
longer
to
look
for
remains
of
the
ruins
of
london
for
there
is
little
pleasure
in
seeing
wonderful
things
if
there
is
no
one
at
all
to
hear
of
them
and
to
wonder
so
i
returned
at
once
to
street
the
little
row
of
huts
and
saw
no
other
record
that
london
had
been
except
that
one
stone
lion
i
went
to
the
right
house
this
time
it
was
very
much
altered
and
more
like
one
of
those
huts
that
one
sees
on
salisbury
plain
than
a
shop
in
the
city
of
london
but
i
found
it
by
counting
the
houses
in
the
street
for
it
was
still
a
row
of
houses
though
pavement
and
city
were
gone
and
it
was
still
a
shop
a
very
different
shop
to
the
one
i
knew
but
things
were
for
sale
there
shepherd
crooks
food
and
rude
axes
and
a
man
with
long
hair
was
there
who
was
clad
in
skins
i
did
not
speak
to
him
for
i
did
not
know
his
language
he
said
to
me
something
that
sounded
like
everkike
it
conveyed
no
meaning
to
me
but
when
he
looked
towards
one
of
his
buns
light
suddenly
dawned
in
my
mind
and
i
knew
that
england
was
even
england
still
and
that
still
she
was
not
conquered
and
that
though
they
had
tired
of
london
they
still
held
to
their
land
for
the
words
that
the
man
had
said
were
av
er
kike
and
then
i
knew
that
that
very
language
that
was
carried
to
distant
lands
by
the
old
triumphant
cockney
was
spoken
still
in
his
birthplace
and
that
neither
his
politics
nor
his
enemies
had
destroyed
him
after
all
these
thousand
years
i
had
always
disliked
the
cockney
dialect
and
with
the
arrogance
of
the
irishman
who
hears
from
rich
and
poor
the
english
of
the
splendour
of
elizabeth
and
yet
when
i
heard
those
words
my
eyes
felt
sore
as
with
impending
tears
it
should
be
remembered
how
far
away
i
was
i
think
i
was
silent
for
a
little
while
suddenly
i
saw
that
the
man
who
kept
the
shop
was
asleep
that
habit
was
strangely
like
the
ways
of
a
man
who
if
he
were
then
alive
would
be
if
i
could
judge
from
the
look
of
the
lion
over
a
thousand
years
old
but
then
how
old
was
i
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
time
moves
over
the
lands
of
dream
swifter
or
slower
than
over
the
fields
we
know
for
the
dead
and
the
long
dead
live
again
in
our
dreams
and
a
dreamer
passes
through
the
events
of
days
in
a
single
moment
of
the
clock
yet
logic
did
not
aid
me
and
my
mind
was
puzzled
while
the
old
man
slept
and
strangely
like
in
face
he
was
to
the
old
man
who
had
shown
me
first
the
little
old
backdoor
i
went
to
the
far
end
of
his
wattled
shop
there
was
a
door
of
a
sort
on
leather
hinges
i
pushed
it
open
and
there
i
was
again
under
the
at
the
back
of
the
shop
at
least
the
back
of
street
had
not
changed
fantastic
and
remote
though
this
grass
street
was
with
its
purple
flowers
and
the
golden
spires
and
the
world
ending
at
its
opposite
pavement
yet
i
breathed
more
happily
to
see
something
again
that
i
had
seen
before
i
thought
i
had
lost
forever
the
world
i
knew
and
now
that
i
was
at
the
back
of
street
again
i
felt
the
loss
less
than
when
i
was
standing
where
familiar
things
ought
to
be
and
i
turned
my
mind
to
what
was
left
me
in
the
vast
lands
of
dream
and
thought
of
saranoora
and
when
i
saw
the
cottages
again
i
felt
less
lonely
even
at
the
thought
of
the
cat
though
he
generally
laughed
at
the
things
i
said
and
the
first
thing
that
i
saw
when
i
saw
the
witch
was
that
i
had
lost
the
world
and
was
going
back
for
the
rest
of
my
days
to
the
palace
of
singanee
and
the
first
thing
that
she
said
was
why
you
been
through
the
wrong
door
quite
kindly
for
she
saw
how
unhappy
i
looked
and
i
said
yes
but
it
all
the
same
street
the
whole
street
altered
and
london
gone
and
the
people
i
used
to
know
and
the
houses
i
used
to
rest
in
and
everything
and
i
tired
what
did
you
want
to
go
through
the
wrong
door
for
she
said
o
that
made
no
difference
i
said
o
did
it
she
said
in
a
contradictory
way
well
i
wanted
to
get
to
the
near
end
of
the
street
so
as
to
find
my
boat
quickly
by
the
embankment
and
now
my
boat
and
the
embankment
and
and
some
people
are
always
in
such
a
hurry
said
the
old
black
cat
and
i
felt
too
unhappy
to
be
angry
and
i
said
nothing
more
and
the
old
witch
said
now
which
way
do
you
want
to
go
and
she
was
talking
rather
like
a
nurse
to
a
small
child
and
i
said
i
have
nowhere
to
go
and
she
said
would
you
rather
go
home
or
go
to
the
ivory
palace
of
singanee
and
i
said
i
got
a
headache
and
i
do
want
to
go
anywhere
and
i
tired
of
the
lands
of
dream
then
suppose
you
try
going
in
through
the
right
door
she
said
that
no
good
i
said
everyone
dead
and
gone
and
selling
buns
there
what
do
you
know
about
time
she
said
nothing
answered
the
old
black
cat
though
nobody
spoke
to
him
run
along
said
the
old
witch
so
i
turned
and
trudged
away
to
street
again
i
was
very
tired
what
does
he
know
about
anything
said
the
old
black
cat
behind
me
i
knew
what
he
was
going
to
say
next
he
waited
a
moment
and
then
said
nothing
when
i
looked
over
my
shoulder
he
was
strutting
back
to
the
cottage
and
when
i
got
to
street
i
listlessly
opened
the
door
through
which
i
had
just
now
come
i
saw
no
use
in
doing
it
i
just
did
wearily
as
i
was
told
and
the
moment
i
got
inside
i
saw
it
was
just
the
same
as
of
old
and
the
sleepy
old
man
was
there
who
sold
idols
and
i
bought
a
vulgar
thing
that
i
did
not
want
for
the
sheer
joy
of
seeing
accustomed
things
and
when
i
turned
from
street
which
was
just
the
same
as
ever
the
first
thing
that
i
saw
was
a
taximeter
running
into
a
hansom
cab
and
i
took
off
my
hat
and
cheered
and
i
went
to
the
embankment
and
there
was
my
boat
and
the
stately
river
full
of
dirty
accustomed
things
and
i
rowed
back
and
bought
a
penny
paper
i
had
been
away
it
seemed
for
one
day
and
i
read
it
from
cover
to
cover
patent
remedies
for
incurable
illnesses
and
all
and
i
determined
to
walk
as
soon
as
i
was
rested
in
all
the
streets
that
i
knew
and
to
call
on
all
the
people
that
i
had
ever
met
and
to
be
content
for
long
with
the
fields
we
know
