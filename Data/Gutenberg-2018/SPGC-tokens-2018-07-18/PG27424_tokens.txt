introduction
upon
being
asked
by
a
reader
whether
the
verses
contained
in
this
book
were
true
illustration
and
is
it
true
it
is
not
true
and
if
it
were
it
would
do
for
people
such
as
me
and
you
who
pretty
nearly
all
day
long
are
doing
something
rather
wrong
because
if
things
were
really
so
you
would
have
perished
long
ago
and
i
would
not
have
lived
to
write
the
noble
lines
that
meet
your
sight
nor
survived
to
draw
the
nicest
things
you
ever
saw
b
jim
ran
away
from
his
nurse
and
was
eaten
by
a
illustration
there
was
a
boy
whose
name
was
jim
his
friends
were
very
good
to
him
they
gave
him
tea
and
cakes
and
jam
and
slices
of
delicious
ham
and
chocolate
with
pink
inside
and
little
tricycles
to
ride
and
illustration
read
him
stories
through
and
through
and
even
took
him
to
the
zoo
but
there
it
was
the
dreadful
fate
befell
him
which
i
now
relate
you
know
at
least
you
to
know
for
i
have
often
told
you
so
that
children
never
are
allowed
to
leave
their
nurses
in
a
crowd
now
this
was
jim
especial
foible
he
ran
away
when
he
was
able
and
on
this
inauspicious
day
he
slipped
his
hand
and
ran
away
he
had
gone
a
yard
when
illustration
bang
with
open
jaws
a
lion
sprang
and
hungrily
began
to
eat
the
boy
beginning
at
his
feet
now
just
imagine
how
it
feels
when
first
your
toes
and
then
your
heels
and
then
by
gradual
degrees
your
shins
and
ankles
calves
and
knees
are
slowly
eaten
bit
by
bit
illustration
no
wonder
jim
detested
it
no
wonder
that
he
shouted
hi
the
honest
keeper
heard
his
cry
though
very
fat
illustration
he
almost
ran
to
help
the
little
gentleman
ponto
he
ordered
as
he
came
for
ponto
was
the
lion
name
ponto
he
cried
illustration
with
angry
frown
let
go
sir
down
sir
put
it
down
the
lion
made
a
sudden
stop
he
let
the
dainty
morsel
drop
and
slunk
reluctant
to
his
cage
snarling
with
disappointed
rage
but
when
he
bent
him
over
jim
the
honest
illustration
eyes
were
dim
the
lion
having
reached
his
head
the
miserable
boy
was
dead
illustration
when
nurse
informed
his
parents
they
were
more
concerned
than
i
can
say
his
mother
as
she
dried
her
eyes
said
well
it
gives
me
no
surprise
he
would
not
do
as
he
was
told
his
father
who
was
bade
all
the
children
round
attend
to
james
miserable
end
and
always
keep
of
nurse
for
fear
of
finding
something
worse
henry
king
chewed
bits
of
string
and
was
early
cut
off
in
dreadful
the
chief
defect
of
henry
king
was
illustration
chewing
little
bits
of
string
at
last
he
swallowed
some
which
tied
itself
in
ugly
knots
inside
illustration
physicians
of
the
utmost
fame
were
called
at
once
but
when
they
came
they
answered
illustration
as
they
took
their
fees
there
is
no
cure
for
this
disease
henry
will
very
soon
be
dead
his
parents
stood
about
his
bed
lamenting
his
untimely
death
when
henry
with
his
latest
breath
cried
oh
my
friends
be
warned
by
me
illustration
that
breakfast
dinner
lunch
and
tea
are
all
the
human
frame
requires
with
that
the
wretched
child
expires
matilda
told
lies
and
was
burned
to
matilda
told
such
dreadful
lies
illustration
it
made
one
gasp
and
stretch
one
eyes
her
aunt
who
from
her
earliest
youth
had
kept
a
strict
regard
for
truth
illustration
attempted
to
believe
matilda
the
effort
very
nearly
killed
her
and
would
have
done
so
had
not
she
discovered
this
infirmity
for
once
towards
the
close
of
day
matilda
growing
tired
of
play
and
finding
she
was
left
alone
went
tiptoe
illustration
to
the
telephone
and
summoned
the
immediate
aid
of
london
noble
within
an
hour
the
gallant
band
were
pouring
in
on
every
hand
from
putney
hackney
downs
and
bow
with
courage
high
and
hearts
they
galloped
roaring
through
the
town
illustration
matilda
house
is
burning
down
inspired
by
british
cheers
and
loud
proceeding
from
the
frenzied
crowd
they
ran
their
ladders
through
a
score
of
windows
on
the
ball
room
floor
and
took
peculiar
pains
to
souse
the
pictures
up
and
down
the
house
illustration
until
matilda
aunt
succeeded
in
showing
them
they
were
not
needed
and
even
then
she
had
to
pay
to
get
the
men
to
go
away
it
happened
that
a
few
weeks
later
her
aunt
was
off
to
the
theatre
to
see
that
interesting
play
second
illustration
she
had
refused
to
take
her
niece
to
hear
this
entertaining
piece
a
deprivation
just
and
wise
to
punish
her
for
telling
lies
that
night
a
fire
break
out
you
should
have
heard
matilda
shout
you
should
have
heard
her
scream
and
bawl
and
throw
the
window
up
and
call
to
people
passing
in
the
street
the
rapidly
increasing
heat
encouraging
her
to
obtain
their
confidence
but
all
in
vain
for
every
time
she
shouted
fire
illustration
they
only
answered
little
liar
and
therefore
when
her
aunt
returned
matilda
and
the
house
were
burned
illustration
franklin
hyde
caroused
in
the
dirt
and
was
corrected
by
his
illustration
his
uncle
came
on
franklin
hyde
carousing
in
the
dirt
he
shook
him
hard
from
side
to
side
and
illustration
hit
him
till
it
hurt
exclaiming
with
a
final
thud
take
illustration
that
abandoned
boy
for
playing
with
disgusting
mud
as
though
it
were
a
toy
moral
from
franklin
hyde
adventure
learn
to
pass
your
leisure
time
in
cleanly
merriment
and
turn
from
mud
and
ooze
and
slime
and
every
form
of
nastiness
but
on
the
other
hand
children
in
ordinary
dress
may
always
play
with
sand
illustration
godolphin
horne
was
cursed
with
the
sin
of
pride
and
became
a
illustration
godolphin
horne
was
nobly
born
he
held
the
human
race
in
scorn
and
lived
with
all
his
sisters
where
his
father
lived
in
berkeley
square
and
oh
the
lad
was
deathly
proud
he
never
shook
your
hand
or
bowed
but
merely
smirked
and
nodded
illustration
thus
how
perfectly
ridiculous
alas
that
such
affected
tricks
should
flourish
in
a
child
of
six
for
such
was
young
godolphin
age
just
then
the
court
required
a
page
whereat
illustration
the
lord
high
chamberlain
the
kindest
and
the
best
of
men
he
went
and
illustration
took
a
perfectly
enormous
book
called
qualified
to
be
attendant
on
his
and
murmured
as
he
scanned
the
list
to
see
that
no
one
should
be
missed
illustration
william
coutts
has
got
the
flue
illustration
and
billy
higgs
would
never
do
illustration
and
guy
de
vere
is
far
too
young
illustration
and
was
father
hung
and
as
for
alexander
byng
i
think
i
know
the
kind
of
thing
a
churchman
cleanly
nobly
born
come
let
us
say
godolphin
horne
but
hardly
had
he
said
the
word
when
murmurs
of
dissent
were
heard
the
king
of
iceland
eldest
son
said
thank
you
i
am
taking
none
the
aged
duchess
of
athlone
remarked
in
her
tone
i
doubt
if
he
is
what
we
need
with
which
the
bishops
all
agreed
and
even
lady
mary
flood
kind
and
oh
so
good
said
no
he
would
do
at
all
he
make
us
feel
a
lot
too
small
the
chamberlain
said
well
well
well
no
doubt
you
right
one
can
not
tell
he
took
his
gold
and
diamond
pen
and
illustration
scratched
godolphin
out
again
so
now
godolphin
is
the
boy
who
blacks
the
boots
at
the
savoy
illustration
algernon
played
with
a
loaded
gun
and
on
missing
his
sister
was
reprimanded

his
young
algernon
the
doctor
son
was
illustration
playing
with
a
loaded
gun
he
pointed
it
towards
his
sister
aimed
very
carefully
but

missed
her

was
standing
near

reprimanded

gun
hildebrand
was
frightened
by
a
passing
motor
and
was
brought
to
illustration
oh
murder
what
was
that
papa
my
child
it
was
a
a
most
ingenious
toy
illustration
designed
to
captivate
and
charm
much
rather
than
to
rouse
alarm
in
any
english
boy
what
would
your
great
grandfather
who
illustration
was
to
general
brue
and
lost
a
leg
at
illustration
waterloo
and
illustration
and
illustration
ligny
too
and
died
at
trafalgar
illustration
what
would
he
have
remarked
to
hear
his
young
descendant
shriek
with
fear
because
he
happened
to
be
near
a
harmless

do
not
fret
about
it

and
purchase
some
lord
lundy
was
too
freely
moved
to
tears
and
thereby
ruined
his
political
illustration
lord
lundy
from
his
earliest
years
was
far
too
freely
moved
to
tears
for
instance
if
his
mother
said
lundy
it
time
to
go
to
bed
he
bellowed
like
a
little
turk
or
if
illustration
his
father
lord
dunquerque
said
hi
in
a
commanding
tone
hi
lundy
leave
the
cat
alone
lord
lundy
letting
go
its
tail
would
raise
so
terrible
a
wail
as
moved
his
grandpapa
the
illustration
duke
to
utter
the
severe
rebuke
when
i
sir
was
a
little
boy
an
animal
was
not
a
toy
his
father
elder
sister
who
was
married
to
a
parvenoo
illustration
confided
to
her
husband
drat
the
miserable
peevish
brat
why
do
they
drown
the
little
beast
suggestions
which
to
say
the
least
are
not
what
we
expect
to
hear
from
daughters
of
an
english
peer
his
grandmamma
his
mother
mother
who
had
some
dignity
or
other
the
garter
or
no
matter
what
i
ca
remember
all
the
lot
said
oh
that
i
were
brisk
and
spry
to
give
him
that
for
which
to
cry
an
empty
wish
alas
for
she
illustration
was
blind
and
nearly
the
illustration
dear
old
butler
thought
but
there
i
really
neither
know
nor
care
for
what
the
dear
old
butler
thought
in
my
opinion
butlers
ought
to
know
their
place
and
not
to
play
the
old
retainer
night
and
day
i
getting
tired
and
so
are
you
let
cut
the
poem
into
two
lord
lundy
it
happened
to
lord
lundy
then
as
happens
to
so
many
men
towards
the
age
of
they
shoved
him
into
politics
in
which
profession
he
commanded
the
income
that
his
rank
demanded
in
turn
as
secretary
for
india
the
colonies
and
war
but
very
soon
his
friends
began
to
doubt
if
he
were
quite
the
man
thus
if
a
member
rose
to
say
as
members
do
from
day
to
day
illustration
arising
out
of
that
reply
illustration
lord
lundy
would
begin
to
cry
a
hint
at
harmless
little
jobs
would
shake
him
with
convulsive
sobs
while
as
for
revelations
these
would
simply
bring
him
to
his
knees
and
leave
him
whimpering
like
a
child
it
drove
his
colleagues
raving
wild
they
let
him
sink
from
post
to
post
from
fifteen
hundred
at
the
most
to
eight
and
barely
six
and
then
to
be
curator
of
big
ben
and
finally
there
came
a
threat
to
oust
him
from
the
cabinet
the
duke
his
aged
bore
the
shame
till
he
could
bear
no
more
he
rallied
his
declining
powers
summoned
the
youth
to
brackley
towers
and
bitterly
addressed
him
thus
sir
you
have
disappointed
us
we
had
intended
you
to
be
the
next
prime
minister
but
three
the
stocks
were
sold
the
press
was
squared
the
middle
class
was
quite
prepared
but
as
it
is
my
language
fails

out
and

the
aged
patriot
groaned
and
died
and
gracious

lundy
cried

given
to
this
furious
sport

would
deliberately
go

and
slam
the
door
like
to
make
her
illustration
uncle
jacob
start
she
was
not
really
bad
at
heart
but
only
rather
rude
and
wild
she
was
an
aggravating
child
it
happened
that
a
marble
bust
of
abraham
was
standing
just
above
the
door
this
little
lamb
had
carefully
prepared
to
slam
and
down
it
came
it
knocked
her
flat
it
laid
her
out
she
looked
like
that
illustration
her
funeral
sermon
which
was
long
and
followed
by
a
sacred
song
mentioned
her
virtues
it
is
true
but
dwelt
upon
her
vices
too
and
showed
the
dreadful
end
of
one
who
goes
and
slams
the
door
for
fun
the
children
who
were
brought
to
hear
the
awful
tale
from
far
and
near
were
much
impressed
and
inly
swore
they
never
more
would
slam
the
door
as
often
they
had
done
before

exploded

loud
report
the
lights
went
out

the
room

filled
with
reeking
smoke
and
in
the
darkness
shrieks
and
yells
were
mingled
with
electric
bells
and
falling
masonry
and
groans
and
crunching
as
of
broken
bones
and
dreadful
shrieks
when
worst
of
all
the

never
lost
his

made
no

he
was
extremely
fond
of
sums

preferred
the

sought
when
it

twice
an
