to

bigelow
in
memory
of
the
delightful
experiences
in
the
heart
of
japan
this
volume
is
affectionately
inscribed
by
the
author
preface
in
an
exceedingly
interesting
article
on
the
early
study
of
the
dutch
in
japan
by
professor
mitsukuri
the
author
has
occasion
to
refer
to
the
uncle
of
one
of
the
three
famous
japanese
scholars
who
translated
into
japanese
a
dutch
book
on
anatomy
he
says
this
uncle
miyada
was
almost
eccentric
in
his
disposition
he
held
it
to
be
a
solemn
duty
to
learn
any
art
or
accomplishment
that
might
be
going
out
of
the
world
and
then
describe
it
so
fully
that
it
might
be
preserved
to
the
nephew
was
faithful
to
his
uncle
s
instructions
and
though
following
medicine
for
his
profession
he
took
it
upon
himself
to
learn
hitoyogiri
certain
kind
of
music
which
was
forgotten
even
went
so
far
as
to
study
a
kind
of
dramatic
though
not
animated
by
miyada
s
spirit
when
i
set
about
the
task
of
collecting
the
material
embodied
in
this
work
i
feel
now
that
the
labor
has
not
been
altogether
in
vain
as
it
may
result
in
preserving
many
details
of
the
japanese
house
of
them
trivial
perhaps
in
a
few
decades
of
years
may
be
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
obtain
whether
this
has
been
accomplished
or
not
the
praiseworthy
ambition
of
the
old
japanese
scholar
might
well
be
imitated
by
the
ethnological
student
in
his
investigations
nothing
can
be
of
greater
importance
than
the
study
of
those
nations
and
peoples
who
are
passing
through
profound
changes
and
readjustments
as
a
result
of
their
compulsory
contact
with
the
vigorous
selfish
and
mercantile
nations
of
the
west
accompanied
on
their
part
by
a
propagandism
in
some
respects
equally
mercenary
and
selfish
thanks
to
the
activity
of
a
number
of
students
of
various
nationalities
in
the
employ
of
the
japanese
government
and
more
especially
to
the
scholarly
of
the
english
legation
in
japan
much
information
has
been
obtained
concerning
this
interesting
people
which
might
otherwise
have
been
lost
if
investigators
and
students
would
bear
in
mind
the
precept
of
miyada
and
seize
upon
those
features
in
social
of
etiquette
frames
ceremonies
and
other
manners
and
are
the
first
to
change
in
any
contact
with
alien
races
a
very
important
work
would
be
accomplished
for
the
future
sociologist
the
native
japanese
student
might
render
the
greatest
service
in
this
work
by
noting
down
from
the
older
persons
before
it
is
too
late
the
social
features
and
habits
of
his
own
people
as
they
were
before
the
late
revolution
profound
changes
have
already
taken
place
in
japan
and
other
changes
are
still
in
progress
as
an
indication
of
the
rapidity
of
some
of
these
changes
reference
might
be
made
to
an
interesting
memoir
by
mcclatchie
on
the
feudal
mansions
of
yedo
and
though
this
was
written
but
ten
years
after
the
revolution
of
he
speaks
of
the
fortified
mansions
where
dwelt
the
feudal
nobles
of
japan
as
in
many
cases
deserted
ruined
and
fallen
into
decay
and
he
describes
observances
and
manners
connected
with
the
such
as
etiquette
of
the
gates
exchange
of
yashiki
rules
relating
to
fires
which
were
then
obsolete
at
the
time
of
his
writing
though
in
full
force
but
a
few
years
before
i
shall
be
particularly
grateful
for
any
facts
concerning
the
japanese
house
beyond
those
recorded
in
this
book
or
which
may
be
already
in
my
possession
as
also
for
the
correction
of
any
errors
which
may
have
unavoidably
been
made
in
the
text
should
a
second
edition
of
this
work
be
called
for
such
new
information
and
corrections
will
be
incorporated
therein
with
due
acknowledgments
i
wish
to
express
my
gratitude
to
bigelow
whose
delightful
companionship
i
enjoyed
during
the
collection
of
many
of
the
facts
and
sketches
contained
in
this
volume
and
whose
hearty
sympathy
and
judicious
advice
were
of
the
greatest
service
to
me
to
professor
and
fenollosa
also
my
thanks
are
especially
due
for
unnumbered
kindnesses
during
my
last
visit
to
japan
i
would
also
here
return
my
thanks
to
a
host
of
japanese
friends
who
have
at
various
times
in
season
and
out
of
season
granted
me
the
privilege
of
sketching
their
homes
and
examining
their
dwellings
from
top
to
bottom
in
quest
of
material
for
this
volume
who
furthermore
have
answered
questions
translated
terms
hunted
up
information
and
in
many
ways
aided
me
that
it
may
be
truly
said
that
had
this
assistance
been
withheld
but
little
of
my
special
work
could
have
been
accomplished
any
effort
to
recall
the
names
of
all
these
friends
would
lead
to
the
unavoidable
omission
of

november
introduction
within
twenty
years
there
has
gradually
appeared
in
our
country
a
variety
of
japanese
objects
conspicuous
for
their
novelty
and
beauty
pottery
and
porcelain
forms
in
wood
and
metal
curious
shaped
boxes
quaint
ivory
carvings
fabrics
in
cloth
and
paper
and
a
number
of
other
objects
as
perplexing
in
their
purpose
as
the
inscriptions
which
they
often
bore
most
of
these
presented
technicalities
in
their
work
as
enigmatical
as
were
their
designs
strange
caprices
in
their
ornamentation
which
though
violating
our
hitherto
recognized
proprieties
of
decoration
surprised
and
yet
delighted
us
the
utility
of
many
of
the
objects
we
were
at
loss
to
understand
yet
somehow
they
gradually
found
lodgment
in
our
rooms
even
displacing
certain
other
objects
which
we
had
been
wont
to
regard
as
decorative
and
our
rooms
looked
all
the
prettier
for
their
substitution
we
found
it
difficult
to
formulate
the
principles
upon
which
such
art
was
based
and
yet
were
compelled
to
recognize
its
merit
violations
of
perspective
and
colors
in
juxtaposition
or
coalescing
that
before
we
had
regarded
as
inharmonious
were
continually
reminding
us
of
japan
and
her
curious
people
slowly
our
methods
of
decoration
became
imbued
with
these
ways
so
new
to
us
and
yet
so
many
centuries
old
to
the
people
among
whom
these
arts
had
originated
gradually
yet
surely
these
arts
at
first
so
little
understood
modified
our
own
methods
of
ornamentation
until
frescos
and
carpets
dishes
and
metal
work
and
christmas
cards
and
even
railroad
advertisements
were
decorated
modelled
and
designed
after
japanese
style
it
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
many
of
our
best
artists
like
coleman
vedder
lafarge
and
others
long
fore
recognized
the
transcendent
merit
of
japanese
decorative
art
it
was
however
somewhat
remarkable
that
the
public
at
large
should
come
so
universally
to
recognize
it
and
in
so
short
a
time
not
only
our
own
commercial
nation
but
france
musical
germany
and
even
conservative
england
yielded
to
this
invasion
not
that
new
designs
were
evolved
by
us
on
the
contrary
we
were
content
to
adopt
japanese
designs
outright
oftentimes
with
a
mixture
of
incongruities
that
would
have
driven
japanese
decorator
stark
mad
designs
appropriate
for
the
metal
mounting
of
a
sword
blazed
out
on
our
ceilings
motives
fror
a
heavy
bronze
formed
the
theme
for
the
decoration
of
friable
pottery
and
suggestions
from
light
crape
were
woven
into
hot
carpets
to
be
trodden
upon
even
with
this
mongrel
admixture
it
was
a
relief
by
any
means
to
have
driven
out
of
our
dwelling
the
nightmares
and
horrors
of
design
we
had
before
endured
so
meekly
objects
for
example
as
a
child
in
dead
brass
kneeling
in
perpetual
supplication
on
a
dead
brass
cushion
while
adroitly
balancing
on
its
head
a
receptacle
for
kerosene
oil
and
a
whole
regiment
of
shapes
equally
monstrous
our
walls
no
longer
assailed
us
with
designs
that
wearied
our
eyes
and
exasperated
our
brains
by
their
inanities
we
were
no
longer
doomed
to
wipe
our
feet
on
cupids
horns
of
plenty
restless
tigers
or
scrolls
of
architectural
magnitudes
under
the
benign
influence
of
this
new
spirit
it
came
to
be
realized
that
it
was
not
always
necessary
to
tear
a
flower
in
bits
to
recognize
its
decorative
value
and
that
the
simplest
objects
in
spray
of
bamboo
a
pine
cone
a
cherry
the
were
quite
sufficient
to
satisfy
our
craving
for
the
beautiful
the
japanese
exhibit
at
the
centennial
exposition
in
philadelphia
came
to
us
as
a
new
revelation
and
the
charming
onslaught
of
that
unrivalled
display
completed
the
victory
it
was
then
that
the
japanese
craze
took
firm
hold
of
us
books
on
japan
rapidly
multiplied
especially
books
on
decorative
art
but
it
was
found
that
such
rare
art
could
be
properly
represented
only
in
the
most
costly
fashion
and
with
plates
of
marvellous
elaboration
what
the
japanese
were
able
to
do
with
their
primitive
methods
of
and
a
few
colors
required
the
highest
genius
of
our
artists
and
and
even
then
the
subtile
spirit
which
the
artist
sought
for
could
not
be
caught
the
more
intelligent
among
our
collectors
soon
recognized
that
the
objects
from
japan
divided
themselves
into
two
groups
one
represented
by
a
few
objects
having
great
intrinsic
merit
with
a
refinement
and
reserve
of
decoration
the
other
group
characterized
by
a
more
florid
display
and
less
delicacy
of
treatment
forming
by
far
the
larger
number
consisting
chiefly
of
forms
in
pottery
porcelain
lacquer
and
metal
work
these
last
were
made
by
the
japanese
expressly
for
the
foreign
market
many
of
them
having
no
place
in
their
economy
and
with
few
exceptions
being
altogether
too
gaudy
and
violent
to
suit
the
japanese
taste
our
country
became
flooded
with
them
even
the
village
grocery
displayed
them
side
by
side
with
articles
manufactured
at
home
for
the
same
class
of
customers
and
equally
out
of
place
in
the
greater
marts
of
the
country
to
us
however
these
objects
were
always
pretty
and
were
moreover
so
much
cheaper
with
all
their
high
duties
and
importer
s
profits
than
the
stuff
to
which
we
had
been
accustomed
that
they
helped
us
out
amazingly
at
every
recurring
christmas
of
the
better
class
of
objects
nearly
all
of
them
were
originally
intended
either
for
personal
use
or
adornment
as
clasps
little
ivory
carvings
sectional
fans
etc
or
mere
objects
of
household
use
such
as
hanging
bronze
and
pottery
vases
incense
burners
lacquer
cabinets
dishes
etc
naturally
great
curiosity
was
awakened
to
know
more
about
the
social
life
of
this
remarkable
people
and
particularly
was
it
desirable
to
know
the
nature
of
the
house
that
sheltered
such
singular
and
beautiful
works
of
art
in
response
to
the
popular
demand
book
after
book
appeared
but
with
some
noteworth
exceptions
they
repeated
the
same
information
usually
prefaced
by
an
account
of
the
more
than
special
privileges
accorded
to
their
authors
by
the
japanese
government
followed
by
history
of
the
japanese
empire
from
its
first
emperor
down
the
present
time
concise
enough
but
interminable
with
its
mythologies
wars
decays
restorations
etc
then
we
had
the
record
of
an
itinerary
of
a
few
weeks
at
some
treaty
port
or
of
a
brief
sojourn
in
the
country
where
to
illustrate
the
bravery
of
the
author
imaginary
dangers
were
conjured
up
a
wild
guess
at
the
ethnical
enigma
erroneous
conceptions
of
japanese
character
and
customs
whole
illustrated
by
sketches
derived
from
previous
works
on
the
same
subject
or
from
japanese
sources
often
without
due
credit
being
given
and
finally
we
were
given
a
forecast
of
the
future
of
japan
with
an
account
of
the
progress
its
public
were
making
in
adopting
outside
customs
with
no
warning
of
the
acts
of
their
arts
would
be
compelled
to
perform
in
the
presence
of
so
many
influences
alien
to
their
nature
as
an
illustration
of
this
could
the
force
of
absurdity
go
further
than
the
attempt
to
introduce
the
italian
school
of
painting
this
in
the
land
of
a
kano
or
the
melancholy
act
of
a
foreign
employé
of
one
of
the
colleges
in
tokio
in
inducing
or
compelling
all
its
pupils
to
wear
hot
woollen
scotch
caps
a
lot
of
handsome
boys
with
graceful
and
picturesque
dress
into
a
mob
of
ridiculous
monkeys
in
these
books
on
japan
we
look
in
vain
for
any
but
the
most
general
description
of
what
a
japanese
home
really
is
even
rein
s
work
so
apparently
monographic
dismisses
the
house
and
garden
in
a
few
pages
the
present
work
is
an
attempt
to
fill
this
deficiency
by
describing
not
only
the
variety
of
dwellings
seen
in
japan
but
by
specializing
more
in
detail
the
variety
of
structure
seen
within
the
building
in
the
following
pages
occasion
has
often
led
to
criticism
and
comparison
aside
from
any
question
of
justice
it
would
seem
as
if
criticism
to
be
of
any
value
should
be
comparative
that
is
to
say
in
any
running
commentary
on
japanese
ways
and
conditions
the
parallel
ways
and
conditions
of
one
s
own
people
should
be
as
frankly
pointed
out
or
at
least
recognized
when
one
enters
your
city
is
fairly
clean
and
of
its
filthy
streets
the
assumption
is
that
the
streets
of
his
own
city
are
clean
and
when
these
are
found
to
dirty
beyond
measure
the
value
of
the
complaint
or
criticism
is
at
once
lost
and
the
author
immediately
set
down
as
a
wilful
maligner
either
we
should
follow
the
dictum
of
the
great
moral
teacher
and
hesitate
to
behold
the
mote
in
others
eyes
or
else
in
so
doing
we
should
consider
the
beam
in
our
own
this
duty
however
even
to
fair
and
unprejudiced
minds
becomes
a
matter
of
great
difficulty
it
is
extraordinary
how
blind
one
may
be
to
the
faults
and
crimes
of
his
own
people
and
how
reluctant
to
admit
them
we
sing
heroic
with
energy
and
enthusiasm
and
are
amazed
to
find
numbers
in
a
japanese
audience
disapproving
because
of
the
bloody
deeds
celebrated
in
such
an
exultant
way
we
read
daily
our
papers
the
details
of
the
most
crimes
and
often
of
the
most
abhorrent
and
unnatural
ones
and
yet
we
make
no
special
reflections
on
the
conditions
of
society
where
such
things
are
possible
or
put
ourselves
much
out
of
the
way
to
arouse
the
people
to
a
due
sense
of
the
degradation
and
stain
on
the
community
at
large
because
of
such
things
but
we
go
to
another
country
and
perhaps
find
a
new
species
of
vice
its
novelty
at
once
arrests
our
attention
and
forthwith
we
howl
at
the
enormity
of
the
crime
and
the
degradation
of
the
nation
in
which
such
a
crime
could
originate
send
home
the
most
exaggerated
accounts
malign
the
people
without
stint
and
then
prate
to
them
about
christian
charity
in
the
study
of
another
people
one
should
if
possible
look
through
colorless
glasses
though
if
one
is
to
err
in
this
respect
it
were
better
that
his
spectacles
should
be
than
grimed
with
the
smoke
of
prejudice
the
student
of
ethnology
as
a
matter
of
policy
if
he
can
put
himself
in
no
more
generous
attitude
had
better
err
in
looking
kindly
and
favorably
at
a
people
whose
habits
and
customs
he
is
about
to
study
it
is
human
nature
the
world
over
to
resist
adverse
criticism
and
when
one
is
prowling
about
with
his
eyes
darkened
by
the
opaquest
of
uncorrected
provincial
glasses
he
is
repelled
on
all
sides
nothing
is
accessible
to
him
he
can
rarely
get
more
than
a
superficial
glance
at
matters
whereas
if
he
tries
honestly
to
seek
out
the
better
attributes
of
a
people
he
is
only
too
welcome
to
proceed
with
any
investigation
he
wishes
to
make
even
customs
and
ways
that
appear
offensive
are
freely
revealed
to
him
knowing
that
he
will
not
wilfully
distort
and
render
more
painful
what
is
at
the
outset
admitted
on
all
hands
to
be
bad
we
repeat
that
such
investigation
must
be
approached
in
a
spirit
of
sympathy
otherwise
much
is
lost
or
misunderstood
this
is
not
only
true
as
to
social
customs
but
also
as
to
studies
in
other
lines
of
research
as
well
professor
fenollosa
the
greatest
authority
on
japanese
pictorial
art
says
most
truthfully
that
it
is
not
enough
to
approach
these
delicate
children
of
the
spirit
with
the
eye
of
mere
curiosity
or
the
cold
rigid
standard
of
an
alien
school
one
s
heart
must
be
large
enough
to
learn
to
love
as
the
japanese
artist
loves
before
the
veil
can
be
lifted
to
the
full
splendor
of
their
hidden
in
this
spirit
i
have
endeavored
to
give
an
account
of
japanese
homes
and
their
surroundings
i
might
have
dealt
only
with
the
huts
of
the
poorest
with
the
squalor
of
their
inmates
and
given
a
meagre
picture
of
japanese
life
or
a
study
might
have
been
made
of
the
homes
of
the
wealthy
exclusively
which
would
have
been
equally
it
seemed
to
me
however
that
a
description
of
the
homes
of
the
middle
classes
with
occasional
reference
to
those
of
the
higher
and
lower
types
would
perhaps
give
a
fairer
picture
of
the
character
and
structure
of
japanese
homes
and
houses
than
had
i
pursued
either
of
the
other
courses
i
may
have
erred
in
looking
through
spectacles
tinted
with
rose
but
if
so
i
have
no
apology
to
make
living
for
some
time
among
a
people
with
whom
i
have
had
only
the
most
friendly
relations
and
to
whom
i
still
owe
a
thousand
debts
of
gratitude
it
would
be
only
a
contemptible
and
jaundiced
temperament
that
could
under
such
circumstances
write
otherwise
than
kindly
or
fail
to
make
generous
allowance
for
what
appear
to
others
as
grave
faults
and
omissions
in
regard
to
japanese
houses
there
are
many
features
not
to
my
liking
and
in
the
ordinary
language
of
travellers
i
might
speak
of
these
houses
as
huts
and
hovels
cold
and
cheerless
and
give
such
a
generic
description
of
them
as
would
include
under
one
category
all
the
houses
on
the
pacific
coast
from
kamtchatka
to
java
faults
these
houses
have
and
in
criticising
them
i
have
endeavored
to
make
my
reflections
comparative
and
i
have
held
up
for
comparison
much
that
is
objectionable
in
our
own
houses
as
well
as
the
work
done
by
our
own
artisans
but
judging
from
the
rage
and
disgust
expressed
in
certain
english
publications
where
one
writer
speaks
of
much
of
the
work
for
wage
as
positively
despicable
and
another
of
the
miseries
entailed
by
the
unscientific
builder
my
comparison
may
legitimately
extend
to
england
also
in
the
present
volume
the
attempt
has
been
made
to
describe
the
japanese
house
and
its
immediate
surroundings
in
general
and
in
detail
no
one
realizes
better
than
the
author
the
meagreness
in
certain
portions
of
this
work
it
is
believed
however
that
with
the
many
illustrations
and
the
classification
of
the
much
will
be
made
clear
that
before
was
vague
the
figures
are
in
every
case
by
one
of
the
relief
processes
of
the
author
s
drawings
and
with
few
exceptions
are
from
his
own
sketches
made
on
the
spot
so
that
whatever
they
lack
in
artistic
merit
they
make
up
in
being
more
or
less
accurate
drawings
of
the
objects
and
features
depicted
the
material
has
been
gleaned
from
an
illustrated
daily
journal
kept
by
the
author
during
three
successive
residences
in
that
delightful
country
embracing
travels
by
land
from
the
northwest
coast
of
yezo
to
the
southernmost
parts
of
satsuma
the
openness
and
accessibility
of
the
japanese
house
are
a
distinguishing
feature
of
japan
and
no
foreigner
visits
that
country
without
bringing
away
delightful
memories
of
the
peculiarly
characteristic
dwellings
of
the
japanese
on
the
occasion
of
the
author
s
last
visit
to
japan
he
also
visited
china
anam
singapore
and
java
and
made
studies
of
the
houses
of
these
various
countries
with
special
reference
to
the
japanese
house
and
its
possible
affinities

the

a
bird
view
of
a
large
city
in
japan
presents
an
appearance
quite
unlike
that
presented
by
any
large
assemblage
of
buildings
at
home
a
view
of
tokio
for
example
from
some
elevated
point
reveals
a
vast
sea
of
roofs
gray
of
the
shingles
and
dark
of
the
tiles
with
dull
reflections
from
their
surfaces
giving
a
sombre
effect
to
the
whole
the
even
expanse
is
broken
here
and
there
by
the
buildings
with
their
ponderous
tiled
roofs
and
ridges
and
pure
white
or
walls
these
though
in
color
adding
to
the
sombre
appearance
form
with
the
exception
of
the
temples
one
of
the
most
conspicuous
features
in
the
general
monotony
the
temples
are
indeed
conspicuous
as
they
tower
far
above
the
pigmy
dwellings
which
surround
them
their
great
black
roofs
with
massive
ridges
and
ribs
and
grand
sweeps
and
white
or
red
gables
render
them
striking
objects
from
whatever
point
they
are
viewed
green
masses
of
springing
from
the
numerous
gardens
add
some
life
to
this
gray
sea
of
domiciles
it
is
a
curious
sight
to
look
over
a
vast
city
of
nearly
a
million
inhabitants
and
detect
no
chimney
with
its
streak
of
blue
smoke
there
is
of
course
no
church
spire
with
its
usual
architectural
inanities
with
the
absence
of
chimneys
and
the
almost
universal
use
of
charcoal
for
heating
purposes
the
cities
have
an
atmosphere
of
remarkable
clearness
and
purity
so
clear
indeed
is
the
atmosphere
that
one
may
look
over
the
city
and
see
distinctly
revealed
the
minuter
details
of
the
landscape
beyond
the
great
canopy
of
smoke
and
fumes
that
forever
shroud
some
of
our
great
cities
is
a
feature
happily
unknown
in
japan
having
got
such
a
bird
view
of
one
city
we
have
seen
them
all
minor
variations
consisting
for
the
most
part
in
the
inequalities
of
the
sites
upon
which
they
rest
a
view
of
kioto
for
example
as
seen
from
some
high
point
is
remarkably
beautiful
and
varied
as
the
houses
creep
out
between
the
hills
that
hem
it
in
in
nagasaki
the
houses
literally
rise
in
tiers
from
the
water
s
edge
to
the
hills
immediately
back
there
to
become
blended
with
the
city
of
the
dead
which
caps
their
summits
a
view
of
nagasaki
from
the
harbor
is
one
of
surpassing
interest
and
beauty

in

the

barely
separated
by
the

which
cross
like

in

direction
and
the
peculiarly
inflammable

of

the
rapidity
with
which
a
conflagration
spreads
when
once
fairly
under
way
in

the

are
stretched
along
the
sides
of
a

nearly

the

have

between

some
villages
which
from
their
situation
have
no
chance
of
expanding
become
densely
crowded
such
for
example
is
the
case
of
enoshima
near
yokohama
wherein
the
main
street
runs
directly
from
the
shore
by
means
of
a

of
steps
at
intervals
to
a
flight
of
stone
steps
which
lead
to

and

is
flanked
on
both
sides
by

and

ravine
of
which
the
street
forms
the
central
axis
is
densely
crowded
with
houses
the
narrowest

leading
to
the
houses
in
the
rear
a
fire
once
started
would
inevitably
result
in
the
destruction
of
every
house
in
the
village
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
one
may
ride
long
distances
in
the
country
without
passing
a
single
dwelling
and
then
abruptly
enter
a
village
the
entrance
to
a
village
is
often
marked
by
a
high
mound
of
earth
on
each
side
of
the
road
generally
surmounted
by
a
tree
or
perhaps
the
evidences
of
an
old
barrier
are
seen
in
the
remains
of
or
a
having
passed
through
the
village
one
enters
the
country
again
with
its
and
cultivated
tracts
as
abruptly
as
he
had
left
it
the
villages
vary
greatly
in
their
appearance
some
are
extremely
trim
and
pretty
with
neat
in
front
of
the
houses
and
an
air
of
taste
and
comfort
everywhere
apparent
other
villages
present
marked
evidences
of
poverty
squalid
houses
with
dirty
children
swarming
about
them
indeed
the
most
striking
contrasts
are
seen
between
the
various
villages
one
passes
through
in
a
long
overland
trip
in
japan
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
a
more
dreary
and
dismal
sight
than
the
appearance
of
some
of
these
village
streets
on
a
rainy
night
no
lighted
window
cheers
the
traveller
only
lines
of
light
glimmer
through
the
chinks
of
the
wooden
shutters
with
which
every
house
is
closed
at
night
on
pleasant
evenings
when
the
paper
screens
alone
are
closed
a
ride
through
a
village
street
is
often
rendered
highly
amusing
by
the
grotesque
which
the
inmates
are
unconsciously
projecting
in
their
movements
to
and
fro

from

in
the
cities
the
quarters
for
the
wealthier
classes
are
not
so
sharply
defined
as
with
us
though
the
love
for
pleasant
outlooks
and
beautiful
scenery
tends
to
enhance
the
value
of
certain
districts
and
consequently
to
bring
together
the
wealthier

in
nearly
all
the
cities
however
you
will
find
the
houses
of
the
wealthy
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
habitations
of
the
poorest
in
tokio
one
may
find
streets
or
narrow
alleys
lined
with
a
continuous
row
of
the
cheapest
shelters
and
here
dwell
the
poorest
people
though
squalid
and
dirty
as
such
places
appear
to
the
japanese
they
are
immaculate
in
comparison
with
the
unutterable
filth
and
misery
of
similar
quarters
in
nearly
all
the
great
cities
of
christendom
certainly
a
rich
man
in
japan
would
not
as
a
general
thing
buy
up
the
land
about
his
house
to
keep
the
poorer
classes
at
a
distance
for
the
reason
that
their
presence
would
not
be
objectionable
since
poverty
in
japan
is
not
associated
with
the
impossible
manners
of
a
similar
class
at
home
before
proceeding
with
a
special
description
of
japanese
homes
a
general
description
of
the
house
may
render
the
chapters
that
are
to
follow
a
little
more
intelligible
the
first
sight
of
a
japanese
house
is
a
house
of
the
people
certainly
disappointing
from
the
infinite
variety
and
charming
character
of
their
various
works
of
art
as
we
had
seen
them
at
home
we
were
anticipating
new
delights
and
surprises
in
the
character
of
the
house
nor
were
we
on
more
intimate
acquaintance
to
be
disappointed
as
an
american
familiar
with
houses
of
certain
types
with
conditions
among
them
signifying
poverty
and
shiftlessness
and
other
conditions
signifying
refinement
and
wealth
i
was
not
competent
to
judge
the
relative
merits
of
a
japanese
house
the
first
sight
then
of
a
japanese
house
is
disappointing
it
is
unsubstantial
in
appearance
and
there
is
a
meagreness
of
color
being
unpainted
it
suggests
poverty
and
this
absence
of
paint
with
the
gray
and
often
color
of
the
boards
leads
one
to
compare
it
with
similar
unpainted
buildings
at
home
these
are
usually
barns
and
sheds
in
the
country
and
the
houses
of
the
poorer
people
in
the
city
with
one
s
eye
accustomed
to
the
bright
contrasts
of
american
houses
with
their
white
or
light
painted
surfaces
rectangular
windows
black
from
the
shadows
within
with
glints
of
light
reflected
from
the
glass
front
door
with
its
pretentious
steps
and
portico
warm
red
chimneys
surmounting
all
and
a
general
trimness
of
appearance
outside
which
is
by
no
means
always
correlated
with
like
conditions
within
is
too
apt
at
the
outset
to
form
a
low
estimate
of
a
japanese
house
an
american
finds
it
difficult
indeed
to
consider
such
a
structure
as
a
dwelling
when
so
many
features
are
absent
that
go
to
make
up
a
dwelling
at
home
doors
or
windows
such
as
he
had
been
familiar
with
no
attic
or
cellar
no
chimneys
and
within
no
and
of
course
no
customary
mantle
no
permanently
enclosed
rooms
and
as
for
furniture
no
beds
or
tables
chairs
or
similar
articles
least
so
it
appears
at
first
sight
one
of
the
chief
points
of
difference
in
a
japanese
house
as
compared
with
ours
lies
in
the
treatment
of
partitions
and
outside
walls
in
our
houses
these
are
solid
and
permanent
and
when
the
frame
is
built
the
partitions
form
part
of
the
framework
in
the
japanese
house
on
the
contrary
there
are
two
or
more
sides
that
have
no
permanent
walls
within
also
there
are
but
few
partitions
which
have
similar
stability
in
their
stead
are
slight
sliding
screens
which
run
in
appropriate
grooves
in
the
floor
and
overhead
these
grooves
mark
the
limit
of
each
room
the
screens
may
be
opened
by
sliding
them
back
or
they
may
be
entirely
removed
thus
throwing
a
number
of
rooms
into
one
great
apartment
in
the
same
way
the
whole
side
of
a
house
may
be
flung
open
to
sunlight
and
air
for
communication
between
the
rooms
therefore
swinging
doors
are
not
necessary
as
a
substitute
for
windows
the
outside
screens
or
are
covered
with
white
paper
allowing
the
light
to
be
diffused
through
the
house
where
external
walls
appear
they
are
of
wood
unpainted
or
painted
black
and
if
of
plaster

or
dark
slate
colored
in
certain
classes
of
buildings

outside
wall
to
a
height
of
several
feet
from
the
ground
and
sometimes
even
the
entire
wall
may
be
tiled
the
interspaces
being
pointed
with
white
plaster
the
roof
may
be
either
lightly
shingled
heavily
tiled
or
thickly
thatched
it
has
a
moderate
pitch
and
as
a
general
thing
the
slope
is
not
so
steep
as
in
our
roofs
nearly
all
the
houses
have
a
verandah
which
is
protected
by
the
eaves
of
the
roof
or
by
a
light
supplementary
roof
projecting
from
beneath
the
eaves
while
most
houses
of
the
better
class
have
a
definite
porch
and
vestibule
or
in
houses
of
the
poorer
class
this
entrance
is
not
separate
from
the
living
room
and
since
the
interior
of
the
house
is
accessible
from
two
or
three
sides
one
may
enter
it
from
any
point
the
floor
is
raised
a
foot
and
a
half
or
more
from
the
ground
and
is
covered
with
thick
straw
mats
rectangular
in
shape
of
uniform
size
with
sharp
square
edges
and
so
closely
fitted
that
the
floor
upon
which
they
rest
is
completely
hidden
the
rooms
are
either
square
or
rectangular
and
are
made
with
absolute
reference
to
the
number
of
mats
they
are
to
contain
with
the
exception
of
the
few
rooms

projections
or
bays

side
a

less
deep

divided
into

which
is
slightly
raised
above
the

or
some
other
object
the

has

and
a

to

ascend

beneath
them
a

this
is
usually
closed

known
to
the
foreigners
as

have
one
or
two
small
windows
and
one

closed

such

in

to
convey
some
idea
of
the
details
connected
with
the
structure
and
inside
finish
of
the
japanese
house
there
is
no
object
in
japan
that
seems
to
excite
more
diverse
and
adverse
criticism
among
foreigners
than
does
the
japanese
house
it
is
a
constant
source
of
perplexity
and
annoyance
to
most
of
them
an
englishman
particularly
whom
emerson
says
he
finds
to
be
him
of
all
men
who
stands
firmest
in
his
shoes
recognizes
but
little
merit
in
the
apparently
frail
and
perishable
nature
of
these
structures
he
naturally
dislikes
the
anomaly
of
a
house
of
the
lightest
description
oftentimes
sustaining
a
roof
of
the
most
ponderous
character
and
fairly
loathes
a
structure
that
has
no
or
at
least
a
truss
while
the
glaring
absurdity
of
a
house
that
persists
in
remaining
upright
without
a
foundation
or
at
least
without
his
kind
of
a
foundation
makes
him
furious
the
mistake
made
by
most
writers
in
criticising
japanese
structure
and
indeed
many
other
matters
connected
with
that
country
is
that
these
writers
do
not
regard
such
matters
from
a
japanese
they
do
not
consider
that
the
nation
is
poor
and
that
the
masses
are
in
poverty
nor
do
they
consider
that
for
this
reason
a
japanese
builds
such
a
house
as
he
can
afford
and
one
that
after
all
is
as
thoroughly
adapted
to
his
habits
and
wants
as
ours
is
to
our
habits
and
wants
the
observation
of
a
japanese
has
shown
him
that
from
generation
to
generation
the
houses
of
his
people
have
managed
to
sustain
themselves
and
if
in
his
travels
abroad
he
has
chanced
to
visit
england
he
will
probably
recall
the
fact
that
he
saw
more
dilapidated
tenements
down
shanties
cracked
walls
and
toppling
fences
in
a
single
day
in
that
virtuous
country
where
there
are
no
typhoons
or
earthquakes
than
he
would
see
in
a
year
s
travel
in
his
own
country
when
one
of
these
foreign
critical
writers
contemplates
the
framework
of
a
japanese
house
and
particularly
the
of
the
roof
and
finds
no
attempt
at
trussing
and
bracing
he
is
seized
with
an
eager
desire
to
go
among
these
people
as
a
missionary
of
trusses
and
braces
is
so
obvious
that
much
wood
might
be
saved
in
regard
to
the
japanese
however
it
is
probable
that
the
extra
labor
of
constructing
braces
and
trusses
would
not
compensate
for
the
difference
saved
in
the
wood
rein
in
his
really
admirable
book
on
japan
says
the
japanese
house
lacks
chiefly
solidity
and
if
he
means
comfort
for
himself
and
his
people
one
can
understand
him
if
he
means
comfort
for
the
japanese
then
he
has
not
the
faintest
conception
of
the
solid
comfort
a
japanese
gets
out
of
his
house
rein
also
complains
of
the
evil
odors
of
the
closet
arrangements
though
his
complaints
refer
more
particularly
to
the
crowded
inns
which
are
often
in
an
exceedingly
filthy
condition
as
regards
these
necessary
conveniences
one
is
led
to
inquire
what
the
japanese
would
think
of
similar
features
in
germany
where
in
the
larger
cities
the
closet
may
be
seen
opening
directly
into
the
front
hall
and
in
some
cases
even
from
the
bad
as
some
of
these
conditions
are
in
japan
they
are
mild
in
comparison
with
like
features
in
germany
the
filthy
state
of
the
larger
cities
in
this
respect
may
be
indicated
by
the
fact
that
the
of
munich
a
few
years
ago
was
and
kaulbach
died
of
cholera
in
that
city
in
indeed
the
presence
of
certain
features
in
every
at
home
and
abroad
are
looked
upon
as
surpassingly
filthy
by
every
japanese
they
truly
are
rein
and
other
writers
speak
of
the
want
of
privacy
in
japanese
dwellings
forgetting
that
privacy
is
only
necessary
in
the
midst
of
vulgar
and
impertinent
people
class
of
which
japan
has
the
minimum
and
the
called
civilized
english
and
american
the
maximum
for
my
part
i
find
much
to
admire
in
a
japanese
house
and
some
things
not
to
my
comfort
the
sitting
posture
on
the
floor
is
painful
until
one
gets
accustomed
to
it
and
naturally
i
find
that
our
chairs
are
painful

found
the

in

extremely
cold

i
question
whether
their
cold
rooms
in

are
not
more
conducive
to
health
than
are
our
apartments
with
our
blistering
stoves
hot
furnaces
or

as
to
the
odors
arising
from
the
closet
in
certain
country
inns
who
does
not
recall
similar
offensive
features
in
many
of
our
country
inns
at
home
with
the
addition
of
slovenly
yards
and
reeking
piggeries
i
question
too
whether
these
odors
are
more
injurious
to
the
health
than
is
the
stifling
air
from
a
damp
and
noisome
cellar
which
not
only
filters
through
our
floors

is
often
served
to
us

s
description
of
the

the
best

stifling

only
too
true
of
many
of
our
american
houses
both
in
the
country
and

whether
the
japanese

is
right
or
wrong
in
its

answers
admirably
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
intended
a

is
certainly
beyond
the
means
of
a
majority
of
this
people
as
indeed
it
is
with
us
and
not
being
able
to
build
such
a
dwelling
they
have
from
necessity
gone
to
the
other
extreme
and
built
a
house
whose
very
structure
enables
it
to
be
rapidly
demolished
in
the
path
of
a
conflagration

even
the

be
quickly

left

for

the
efforts
of
the
firemen
in
checking
the
progress
of
a
conflagration
consist
mainly
in
tearing
down
these
adjustable
structures
and
in
this
connection
it
may
be
interesting
to
record
the
curious
fact
that
oftentimes
at
a
fire
the
streams
are
turned
not
upon
the
flames
but
upon
the
men
engaged
in
tearing
down
the

however
that
are
imperatively
demanded

are
such
modifications
as
shall
render
the

less
inflammable
while
these
inflammable
houses
may
be
well
enough
in
the
suburbs
or
in
country
villages
they
are
certainly
quite
out
of
place
in
cities
and
here
indeed
the
authorities
are
justified
in
imposing
such
restrictions
as
shall
not
bear
too
heavily
upon
the
people
the
japanese
should
clearly
understand
that
insuperable
difficulties
are
to
be
encountered
in
any
attempt
to
modify
their
style
of
dwellings
and
that
many
of
such
proposed
modifications
are
neither
judicious
nor
desirable
that
slight
changes
for
safety
may
be
effected
however
there
can
be
no

agency

be

have
specified
certain

within
which
shingled

where

existed

have
compelled
the
substitution

lead

results

as
to
altering

it
is
not

impracticable
but
impossible
if
such

are
effected

the

adhering

were
perfectly
acquainted

they
knew
that
its

would
introduce
complexity

therefore
they
wisely
rejected
it

in
rough
framing
and
similar
work
being
done
by
the
carpenter
proper
great
care
is
taken
to
secure
wood
that
matches
in
grain
and
color
and
this
can
be
done
only
by
getting
material
that
has
come
from
the
same
log
in
the
lumberyard
one
notices
boards
of
uniform
lengths
tied
up
in
bundles
fact
tied
up
in
precisely
the
same
position
that
the
wood
occupied
in
the
trunk
before
it
was
sawed
into
boards
so
with
other
wood
material
pieces
are
kept
together
in
the
same
manner
one
never
sees
in
a
a
promiscuous
pile
of
boards
but
each
log
having
been
cut
into
boards
is
securely
tied
without
displacement
as
the
rooms
are
made
in
sizes
corresponding
to
the
number
of
mats
they
are
to
contain
the
beams
uprights
rafters
boards
for
the
ceiling
and
all
strips
are
got
out
in
sizes
to
accommodate
these
various
dimensions
the
dimensions
of
the
mats
from
one
end
of
the
empire
to
the
other
are
approximately
three
feet
wide
and
six
feet
long
and
these
are
fitted
compactly
on
the
floor
the
architect
marks
on
his
plan
the
number
of
mats
each
room
is
to
contain
number
defining
the
size
of
the
room
hence
the
lumber
used
must
be
of
definite
lengths
and
the
carpenter
is
sure
to
find
these
lengths
at
the
it
follows
from
this
that
but
little
waste
occurs
in
the
construction
of
a
japanese
house
far
different
is
it
with
us
in
our
extravagant
and
senseless
methods
of
in
our
country
a
man
after
building
a
wooden
house
finds
his
cellar
and
shed
choked
to
repletion
with
the
waste
of
his
new
house
and
for
a
year
or
more
at
least
has
the
grim
comfort
of
feeding
his
fireplaces
and
kitchen
stove
with
rough
and
finished
woods
which
have
cost

the
ordinary
ceiling
in
a
japanese
house
consists
of
wide
thin
boards
with
their
edges
slightly
overlapping
these
boards
at
first
sight
appear
to
be
supported
by
narrow
strips
of
wood
like
slender
beams
upon
which
the
boards
rest
on
reflection
however
it
soon
becomes
apparent
that
these
diminutive
measuring
in
section
an
inch
square
or
less
are
altogether
inadequate
to
support
the
ceiling
thin
and
light
as
the
boards
composing
it
really
are
as
one
examines
the
ceiling
he
finds
no
trace
of
pin
or
nail
and
finally
comes
to
wonder
how
the
strips
and
boards
are
held
in
place
and
why
the
whole
ceiling
does
not
sag
the
explanation
is
that
the
strips
upon
which
the
boards
are
to
rest
are
first
stretched
across
the
room
at
distances
apart
varying
from
ten
to
eighteen
inches
the
ends
of
these
strips
are
supported
by
a
moulding
which
is
secured
to
the
uprights
of
the
wall
in
cheap
houses
this
moulding
in
section
is
angular
notches
are
cut
in
the
uprights
and
into
these
notches
the
sharp
edge
of
the
angular
moulding
rests
and
is
secured
the
moulding
is
cut
in
this
way
to
economize
material
the
strips
having
been
adjusted
they
are
brought
to
a
uniform
level
but
crowning
slightly
is
the
centre
is
a
little
higher
than
the
sides
are
held
in
place
either
by
a
long
board
being
placed
temporarily
beneath
them
and
propped
up
from
the
floor
below
or
else
a
long
stick
is
placed
beneath
them
which
is
supported
by
a
stout
string
from
the
rafters
above
a
low
staging
is
then
erected
on
the
floor
the
stud
of
the
room
rarely
being
over
seven
or
eight
feet
and
the
carpenter
standing
between
the
while
elevated
upon
the
staging
adjusts
the
boards
one
after
the
other
as
they
are
passed
up
to
him
the
first
board
is
placed
against
the
wall
its
edge
fitting
into
a
groove
in
the
uprights
the
next
board
is
placed
with
its
edge
on
the
first
board
and
then
nailed
from
above
with
wooden
or
bamboo
pegs
to
the
thus
it
is
that
no
nail
or
peg
holes
appear
in
the
ceiling
from
below
board
after
board
is
thus
placed
in
position
each
board
lapping
slightly
over
the
one
before
it
and
each
in
turn
being
slightly
nailed
to
the
strips
each
board
has
a
deep
wide
groove
ploughed
out
near
its
lapping
edge
so
that
it
bends
very
readily
and
is
thus
brought
down
on
the
strip
below
when
the
boards
are
carried
in
this
manner
half
way
across
the
room
a
long
narrow
and
thick
piece
of
wood
say
six
feet
in
length
is
placed
on
the
last
board
laid
within
an
inch
of
its
free
edge
and
parallel
to
it
this
piece
is
firmly
nailed
to
the
board
upon
which
it
rests
and
into
the
below
to
the
edge
of
this
piece
two
or
three
long
strips
of
wood
are
nailed
vertically

upper
ends
being
nailed
to
the
nearest
rafters
above
in
this
way
is
the
ceiling
suspended
after
this
has
been
done
the
remaining
boards
of
the
ceiling
are
placed
in
position
and
secured
one
after
another
until
the
last
is
reached
to
secure
the
last
one
in
position
the
carpenter
gets
down
from
his
position
and
adopts
other
methods
one
method
is
to
place
this
board
on
the
last
one
secured
and
weight
it
with
a
few
heavy
stones
and
then
it
is
moved
along
from
below
and
placed
in
position
where
it
remains
quite
as
firm
as
if
it
had
been
lightly
nailed
in
case
there
is
a
closet
in
the
room
or
a
recess
the
last
board
is
sawed
into
two
or
three
lengths

are
placed

taken
to

sections
come
directly
over

that
from
below

appearance
is
that
of
a
continuous
board
the
sections
are
so
arranged
as
to
length
that
the
last
piece
comes
in
the
closet

we
have
been
thus
explicit
in

the

because
so
few
even
among
the
japanese
seem
to
understand
precisely
the
manner
in
which
it
is
suspended
in
long
rooms
one
is
oftentimes
surprised
to
see
boards
of
great
width
composing
the
ceiling

apparently
continuous

one
end
of
the
room
to
the
other

appears
to
be
a

in

the

is
accomplished
by
taking
two
adjacent
boards
in

boards
as
previously
figured

them
so

sometimes
a
number
of
lengths
of
board
may
be
continued
in
this
way
and
yet
from

will
be
readily

in

country
a
carpenter
has
to
ransack
a
to
find
wood
of
a
similar
grain
and
color
and
even
then
he
generally
fails
to
get
wood
of
precisely
the
same
kind
the
permanent
partitions
within
the
house
are
made
in
various
ways

one
method

bamboos

are
nailed
quite
close

put
considerable
pains
are
taken
as
to
the
plastering
the
plasterer
brings
to
the
house
samples
of
sands
and
clays
so
that
one
may
select
from
these

methods

will
be

a
somewhat
extended
experience
with
the
common
everyday
carpenter
at
home
leads
me
to
say
without
fear
of
contradiction
that
in
matters
pertaining
to
their
craft
the
japanese
carpenters
are
superior
to
american
not
only
do
they
show
their
superiority
in
their
work
but
in
their
versatile
ability
in
making
new
things
one
is
amazed
to
see
how
patiently
a
japanese
carpenter
or
will
struggle
over
plans
not
only
drawn
in
ways
new
and
strange
to
him
but
of
objects
equally
new
struggle
successfully
it
is
a
notorious
fact
that
most
of
the
carpenters
in
our
smaller
towns
and
villages
are
utterly
incompetent
to
carry
out
any
special
demand
made
upon
them
outside
the
building
of
the
conventional
house
and
ordinary
roof
they
stand
bewildered
in
the
presence
of
a
or
cornice
outside
the
prescribed
ruts
with
which
they
and
their
fathers
were
familiar
indeed
in
most
cases
their
fathers
were
not
carpenters
nor
will
their
children
be
and
herein
alone
the
japanese
carpenter
has
an
immense
advantage
over
the
american
for
his
trade
as
well
as
other
trades
have
been
perpetuated
through
generations
of
families
the
little
children
have
been
brought
up
amidst
the
odor
of
fragrant
shavings
with
childish
hands
performed
the
duties
of
an
adjustable
vise
or
clamp
and
with
the
same
tools
which
when
children
they
have
handed
to
their
fathers
they
have
in
later
days
earned
their
daily
rice
when
i
see
one
of
our
carpenters
ponderous
made
of
polished
woods
inlaid
with
brass
decorations
and
filled
to
repletion
with
several
hundred
dollars
worth
of
highly
polished
and
elaborate
implements
and
contemplate
the
work
often
done
with
them
everything
binding
that
should
go
loose
and
everything
rattling
that
should
be
tight
and
much
work
that
has
to
be
done
twice
over
with
an
indication
everywhere
of
a
poverty
of
ideas
then
recall
the
japanese
carpenter
with
his
ridiculously
light
and
flimsy
containing
a
meagre
assortment
of
rude
and
primitive
tools
the
carpentry
of
the
two
people
i
am
forced
to
the
conviction
that
civilization
and
modern
appliances
count
as
nothing
unless
accompanied
with
a
moiety
of
brains
and
some
little
taste
and
wit
it
is
a
very
serious
fact
that
no
one
in
our
country
is
acquiring
faithfully
the
carpenter
s
trade
much
of
this
lamentable
condition
of
things
is
no
doubt
due
to
the
fact
that
has
supplanted
the
of
former
times
doors
blinds
sashes
mouldings
are
now
turned
out
by
the
cord
and
mile
and
all
done
in
such
greedy
haste
and
with
the
greenest
of
lumber
that
if
it
does
not
tumble
to
pieces
in
transportation
it
is
sure
to
do
so
very
soon
after
entering
into
the
nevertheless
the
miserable
truth
yet
remains
that
any
man
who
has
nailed
up
a
few
boxes
or
stood
in
front
of
a
circular
saw
for
a
few
months
feels
competent
to
exercise
all
the
duties
of
that
most
honorable
craft
building
of
a
house
it
may
be
interesting
in
this
connection
to
mention
a
few
of
the
principal
tools
one
commonly
sees
in
use
among
the
japanese
carpenters
after
having
seen
the
good
and
serviceable
carpentry
the
perfect
joints
and
complex
mortises
done
by
good
japanese
workmen
one
is
astonished
to
find
that
they
do
their
work
without
the
aid
of
certain
appliances
considered
indispensable
by
similar
craftsmen
in
our
country
they
have
no
bench
no
vise
no
and
no
and
as
for
machinery
they
have
absolutely
nothing
with
many
places
which
could
be
utilized
for
the
old
country
has
not
occurred
to
them
their
tools
appear
to
be
roughly
made
and
of
primitive
design
though
evidently
of
the
steel
the
only
substitute
for
the
carpenter
s
bench
is
a
plank
on
the
floor
or
on
two
horses
a
square
firm
upright
post
is
the
nearest
approach
to
a
bench
and

for
to
this
beam
a
block
of
wood
to
be
sawed
into
pieces

firmly
held
a
big
wooden
wedge
is
bound
firmly
to
the
post
with
a
stout
rope
and
this
driven
down
with
vigorous
blows
till
it
pinches
the
block
which
is
to
be
cut
into
the
desired
proportions

of
the

the
japanese
carpenter
handles
them
quite
differently
from
our
workman
for
instance
he
draws
the
plane
towards
him
instead
of
pushing
it
from
him
the
planes
are
very
implements
their
bodies
instead
of
being
thick
blocks
of

are
quite
wide
and
thin
e
and
the
blades
are
inclined
at
a
greater
angle
than
the

in

in
some

however
the

stands
vertical
this
is
used

of
the

scrapers

giving
wood
a
smooth
finish

might
be

advantage
by
our

substitute
for
the
piece
of
glass
or
thin
plate
of

with
which
they
usually
scrape
the

cylindrical
handle
as
long

itself

our

engage
one
hand
in
holding
the

the

on

his

and
stooping
over
with
his

hands

the

cuts

of
working

could
never

in

offered
in

that
in

shaken

earthquakes
no
stately
structures
or
buildings
of
lofty
proportions
can
endure
nevertheless
many
such

do
exist

were

to

says
with

in

is
less
aimed
at
than
the
general
effect
resulting
from
the
grandeur
and
harmony
of
the
proportions
of
the
buildings
in
this
respect
some
of
the
seigniorial
residences
of
japan
deserve
to
figure
among
the
architectural
monuments
of
eastern
in
regard
to
the
architecture
of
japan
as
to
other
matters
one
must
put
himself
in
an
attitude
of
sympathy
with
her
people
or
at
least
he
must
become
awakened
to
a
sympathetic
appreciation
of
their
work
and
the
conditions
under
which
it
has
arisen
above
all
he
must
rid
himself
of
all
preconceived
ideas
as
to
what
a
house
should
be
and
judge
the
work
of
a
japanese
builder
solely
from
the
japanese
architectural
edifices
such
as
we
recognize
as
architectural
do
not
exist
outside
her
temples
and
castles
some
reason
for
this
condition
of
things
may
be
looked
for
in
the
fact
that
the
vast
majority
of
the
japanese
are
poor
poor
and
further
in
the
fact
that
the
idea
of
buildings
with
the
exception
of
the
yashiki
barracks
has
never
entered
a
japanese
mind
family
with
few
exceptions
managing
to
have
a
house
of
its
own
as
a
result
of
this
a
vast
number
of
the
houses
are
shelters
merely
and
are
such
from
necessity
though
even
among
these
poorer
shelters
little
bits
of
temple
architecture
creep
in
as
scanty
however
in
that
respect
as
are
similar
features
in

at

which
may
have
a
bit
of
grecian
suggestion
in
the

or
of
doric
in

in
considering
the

of
the

moreover
one
should
take
into
account
their
methods
of
worship
and
precisely
what
use
the
worshippers
make
of
these
remarkable
edifices
and
so
with
intelligent
sympathy
finally
aroused
in
all
these
matters
they
begin
to
wear
a
new

before
now

locked

tied

to

must
be
inspiring

description
and
the
contrast
between
these

renders
the
former
all
the
more
grand
and
impressive
foreigners
though
familiar
with
the
cathedral
architecture
of
europe
must
yet
see
much
to
admire
in
these
buildings
even
in
the
smaller
towns
and
villages
where
one
might
least
expect
to
find
such
structures
the
traveller
sometimes
encounters
these
stately
edifices
their
surroundings
are
invariably
picturesque
no
sterile
lot
or
worthless
outside
the
village
will
suit
these
simple
people
but
the
most
charming
and
beautiful
place
is
always
selected
as
a
site
for
their
temples
of
worship
whatever
may
be
said
regarding
the
architecture
of
japan
the
foreigner
at
least
finds
it
difficult
to
recognize
any
distinct
types
of
architecture
among
the
houses
or
to
distinguish
any
radical
differences
in
the
various
kinds
of
dwellings
he
sees
in
his
travels
through
the
country
it
may
be
possible
that
these
exist
for
one
soon
gets
to
recognize
the
differences
between
the
ancient
and
modern
house
there
are
also
marked
differences
between
the
compact
house
of
the
merchant
in
the
city
and
the
country
house
but
as
for
special
types
of
architecture
that
would
parallel
the
different
styles
found
in
our
country
there
are
none
everywhere
one
notices
minor
details
of
finish
and
ornament
which
he
sees
more
fully
developed
in
the
temple
architecture
and
which
is
evidently
derived
from
this
source
and
if
it
can
be
shown
as
it
unquestionably
can
that
these
features
were
brought
into
the
country
by
the
priests
who
brought
one
of
the
two
great
religions
then
we
can
trace
many
features
of
architectural
detail
to
their
home
and
to
the
avenues
through
which
they
came
in
connection
with
the
statement
just
made
that
it
is
difficult
to
recognize
any
special
types
of
architecture
in
japanese
dwellings
it
may
be
interesting
to
mention
that
we
found
it
impossible
to
get
books
in
their
language
treating
of
house
architecture
doubtless
books
of
this
nature
exist
they
must
exist
but
though
the
writer
had
a
japanese
bookseller
and
a
number
of
intelligent
friends
among
the
japanese
looking
for
such
books
he
never
had
the
good
fortune
to
secure
any
books
in
abundance
can
be
got
treating
of
temple
architecture
from
the
plans
of
the
framing
to
the
completed
structure
also
of
or
gateways
etc
plans
of
buildings
for
their
ceremonies
and
endless
designs
for
the
inside
finish
of
a
house
recesses
screens
and
indeed
all
the
delicate
work
easily
obtainable
but
a
book
which
shall
show
the
plans
and
elevations
of
the
ordinary
dwelling
the
writer
has
never
yet
seen
a
number
of
friends
have
given
him
the
plans
of
their
houses
as
made
by
the
carpenter
but
there
were
no
elevations
or
details
of
outside
finish
represented
it
would
seem
as
if
for
the
ordinary
houses
at
least
it
were
only
necessary
to
detail
in
plan
the
number
and
size
of
the
rooms
leaving
the
rest
of
the
structure
to
be
completed
in
any
way
by
the
carpenter
so
long
as
he
contrived
to
keep
the
rain
out
if
there
is
no
attempt
at
architectural
display
in
the
of
japan
the
traveller
is
at
least
spared
those
miserable
experiences
he
so
often
encounters
in
his
own
country
where
to
a
few
houses
of
good
taste
he
is
sure
to
pass
hundreds
of
perforated
wooden
boxes
with
angular
roofs
and
red
chimneys
unrelieved
by
a
single
moulding
and
now
and
then
to
meet
with
one
of
those
abominations
as
well
as
with
other
forms
equally
grotesque
and
equally
offending
good
taste
owing
to
the
former
somewhat
isolated
life
of
the
different
provinces
the
style
of
building
in
japan
varies
considerably
and
this
is
more
particularly
marked
in
the
design
of
the
roof
and
ridge
though
the
japanese
are
conservative
in
many
things
concerning
the
house
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
changes
have
taken
place
in
the
house
architecture
within
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
at
all
events
houses
of
the
olden
times
have
much
heavier
beams
in
their
frame
and
wider
planks
in
their
structure
than
have
the
houses
of
more
recent
times
a
probable
reason
is
that
wood
was
much
cheaper
in
past
times
or
it
is
possible
that
experience
has
taught
them
that
sufficiently
strong
houses
can
be
made
with
lighter
material
the
japanese
dwellings
are
always
of
wood
usually
of
one
story
and
unpainted
rarely
does
a
house
strike
one
as
being
specially
marked
or
better
looking
than
its
neighbors
more
substantial
certainly
some
of
them
are
and
yet
there
is
a
sameness
about
them
which
becomes
wearisome
particularly
is
this
the
case
with
the
long
uninteresting
row
of
houses
that
border
a
village
street
their
picturesque
roofs
alone
save
them
from
becoming
monotonous
a
closer
study
however
reveals
some
marked
differences
between
the
country
and
city
houses
as
well
as
between
those
of
different
provinces
the
country
house
if
anything
more
than
a
shelter
from
the
elements
is
larger
and
more
substantial
than
the
city
house
and
with
its
ponderous
thatched
roof
and
elaborate
ridge
is
always
picturesque
one
sees
much
larger
houses
in
the
north
of
grand
proportions
and
an
amplitude
of
space
beneath
that
farther
south
occurs
only
under
the
roofs
of
temples
we
speak
now
of
the
houses
of
the
better
classes
for
the
poor
laborer
and
fisherman
as
well
as
their
prototypes
in
the
city
possess
houses
that
are
little
better
than
shanties
built
as
a
friend
has
forcibly
expressed
it
of
chips
paper
and
but
even
these
huts
clustered
together
as
they
oftentimes
are
in
the
larger
cities
are
palatial
in
contrast
to
the
shattered
and
filthy
condition
of
a
like
class
of
tenements
in
many
of
the
cities
of
christian
countries
in
travelling
through
the
country
the
absence
of
a
middle
class
as
indicated
by
the
dwellings
is
painfully
apparent
it
is
true
that
you
pass
now
and
then
large
comfortable
houses
with
their
broad
thatched
roofs
showing
evidences
of
wealth
and
abundance
in
the
numerous
and
outbuildings
surrounding
them
but
where
you
find
one
of
these
you
pass
hundreds
which
are
barely
more
than
shelters
for
their
inmates
and
within
the
few
necessary
articles
render
the
evidences
of
poverty
all
the
more
apparent
though
the
people
that
inhabit
such
shelters
are
very
poor
they
appear
contented
and
cheerful
notwithstanding
their
poverty
other
classes
who
though
not
are
yet
poor
in
every
sense
of
the
word
occupy
dwellings
of
the
simplest
character
many
of
the
dwellings
are
often
diminutive
in
size
and
as
one
looks
in
at
a
tiny
cottage
containing
two
or
three
rooms
at
the
most
the
entire
house
hardly
bigger
than
a
room
at
home
and
observes
a
family
of
three
or
four
persons
living
quietly
and
in
a
cleanly
manner
in
this
limited
space
he
learns
that
in
japan
at
least
poverty
and
constricted
quarters
are
not
always
correlated
with
coarse
manners
filth

crime

absence
of
all
jogs
and
recesses
save
the
and
companion
recess
in
the
best
room
are
noticeable
features
these
recesses
vary
in
depth
from
two
to
three
feet
or
more
depending
on
the
size
of
the
room
and
are
almost
invariably
in
that
side
of
the
room
which
runs
at
a
right
angle
with
the
verandah
or
if
in
the
second
story
at
a
right
angle
with
the
balcony
the
division
between
the
recesses
consists
of
a
light
partition
partly
or
wholly
closed
which
generally
separates
the
recesses
into
two
equal
bays
the
bay
nearest
the
verandah
is
called
the
in
this
recess
hang
one
or
two
pictures
usually
one
and
on
its
floor
which
is
slightly
raised
above
the
level
of
the
mats
of
the
main
floor
stands
a
vase
or
some
other
ornament
the
companion
bay
has
usually
a
little
closet
or
cupboard
closed
by
sliding
screens
and
one
or
two
shelves
above
and
also
another
long
shelf
near
its
ceiling
all
closed
by
sliding
screens
at
the
risk
of
some
repetition
more
special
reference
will
be
made
farther
on
to
these
peculiar
and
eminently
characteristic
features
of
the
japanese
house
fig
in
fig
in
in
my
remarks
on
japanese
in
chapter
allusion
was
made
to
the
movable
partitions
dividing
the
rooms
consisting
of
light
frames
of
wood
covered
with
paper
these
are
nearly
six
feet
in
height
and
about
three
feet
in
width
the
of
a
house
as
we
have
already
said
is
arranged
with
special
reference
to
the
sliding
screens
as
well
as
to
the
number
of
mats
which
are
to
cover
the
floor
in
each
corner
of
the
room
is
a
square
post
and
within
eighteen
inches
or
two
feet
of
the
ceiling
ran
from
post
to
post
these
have
grooves
on
their
under
side
in
which
the
screens
are
to
run
not
only
are
most
of
the
partitions
between
the
rooms
made
up
of
sliding
screens
but
a
large
portion
of
the
exterior
partitions
as
well
are
composed
of
these
light
and
adjustable
devices
a
house
may
have
a
suite
of
three
or
four
rooms
in
a
line
and
the
outside
partitions
be
made
up
entirely
of
these
movable
screens
and
the
necessary
posts
to
support
the
roof
posts
coming
in
the
corners
of
the
rooms
and
marking
the
divisions
between
the
rooms
the
outer
screens
are
covered
with
white
paper
and
when
closed
a
subdued
and
diffused
light
enters
the
room
they
may
be
quickly
removed
leaving
the
entire
front
of
the
house
open
to
the
air
and
sunshine
the
screens
between
the
rooms
are
covered
with
a
thick
paper
which
may
be
left
plain
or
ornamented
with
sketchy
or
elaborate
drawings
the
almost
entire
absence
of
swinging
doors
is
at
once
noticeable
though
now
and
then
one
sees
them
in
other
portions
of
the
house
the
absence
of
all
paint
varnish
oil
or
filling
which
too
often
defaces
our
rooms
at
home
is
at
once
remarked
and
the
ridiculous
absurdity
of
covering
a
good
grained
with
paint
and
then
with
brush
and
comb
trying
to
imitate
nature
by
scratching
in
a
series
of
lines
the
japanese
are
never
guilty
of
on
the
contrary
the
wood
is
left
in
just
the
condition
in
which
it
leaves
the
s
plane
with
a
simple
surface
smooth
but
not
polished
polished
surfaces
occur
however
which
will
be
referred
to
in
the
proper
place
oftentimes
in
some
of
the
parts
the
original
surface
of
the
wood
is
left
sometimes
with
the
bark
retained
whenever
the
japanese
workman
can
leave
a
bit
of
nature
in
this
way
he
is
delighted
to
do
so
he
is
sure
to
avail
himself
of
all
curious
features
in
wood
it
may
be
the
effect
of
some
fungoid
growth
which
marks
a
bamboo
curiously
or
the
sinuous
tracks
produced
by
the
larvae
of
some
beetle
that
oftentimes
traces
the
surface
of
wood
just
below
the
bark
with
curious
designs
or
a
knot
or
burl
his
eye
never
misses
these
features
in
finishing
a
room
the
floors
are
often
roughly
made
for
the
reason
that
straw
mats
two
or
three
inches
in
thickness
cover
them
completely
in
our
remarks
on
construction
allusion
has
already
been
made
to
the
dimensions
of
these
mats
before
proceeding
further
into
the
details
of
the
rooms
it
will
be
well
to
examine
the
plans
of
a
few
dwellings
copied
directly
from
the
architect
s
drawings
the
first
plan
given
is
that
of
a
house
built
in
tokio
a
few
years
ago
in
which
the
writer
has
spent
many
pleasant
hours
the
main
house
measures
by
feet
the
l
measures
fifteen
by
feet
the
solid
black
squares
represent
the
heavier
upright
beams
which
support
the
roof
the
solid
black
circles
represent
the
support
for
the
l
as
well
as
for
the
verandah
roof
the
areas
marked
with
close
parallel
lines
indicate
the
verandah
while
the
double
parallel
lines
indicate
the
sliding
screens
solid
black
lines
showing
the
permanent
partitions
the
kitchen
bathroom
and
certain
platforms
are
indicated
by
parallel
lines
somewhat
wider
apart
than
those
that
indicate
the
verandah
the
lines
running
obliquely
indicate
an
area
where
the
boards
run
towards
a
central
gutter
slightly
depressed
below
the
common
level
of
the
floor
here
stands
the
large
earthen
or
the
wooden
and
water
spilled
upon
the
floor
finds
its
way
out
of
the
house
by
the
gutter
the
small
areas
on
the
outside
of
the
house
shaded
in
section
represent
the
closets
or
cases
in
which
the
or
wooden
shutters
which
so
effectually
close
the
house
at
night
are
stowed
away
in
the
the
house
contains
a
vestibule
a
hall
seven
rooms
not
including
the
kitchen
and
nine
closets
these
rooms
if
named
after
our
nomenclature
would
be
as
follows
study
library
parlor
room
servants
and
kitchen
as
no
room
contains
any
article
of
furniture
like
a
bed
consisting
of
wadded
comforters
being
made
up
temporarily
upon
the
soft
mats
is
obvious
that
the
bedding
can
be
placed
in
any
room
in
the
house
the
absence
of
nearly
all
furniture
gives
one
an
uninterrupted
sweep
of
the
floor
so
that
the
entire
floor
can
be
covered
with
sleepers
if
necessary
great
convenience
certainly
when
one
has
to
entertain
unexpectedly
a
crowd
of
guests
certain
closets
are
used
as
receptacles
for
the
comforters
where
they
are
stowed
away
during
the
time
the
absence
of
all
barns
and
other
is
particularly
noticeable
and
as
the
house
has
no
cellar
one
wonders
where
the
fuel
is
stowed
in
certain
areas
of
the
kitchen
floor
the
planks
are
removable
the
edges
of
special
planks
being
notched
to
admit
the
finger
so
that
they
can
be
lifted
up
one
by
one
and
beneath
them
a
large
space
is
revealed
in
which
wood
and
charcoal
are
kept
in
the
vestibule
which
has
an
earth
floor
is
a
narrow
area
of
wood
flush
with
the
floor
within
and
in
this
also
the
boards
may
be
lifted
up
in
a
similar
way
disclosing
a
space
below
wherein
the
wooden
clogs
and
umbrellas
may
be
stowed
out
of
sight
these
arrangements
in
the
hall
are
seen
in
the
houses
of
the
moderately
people
but
not
so
far
as
i
know
in
the

the

each
room
accommodates
the
number
of
mats
mentioned
the
last
three
named
rooms
are
bordered
by
the
verandah
the
expense
of
this
house
complete
was
about
one
thousand
dollars
the
land
upon
which
it
stood
contained
about
square
feet
and
was
valued
at
three
hundred
and
thirty
dollars
upon
this
the
government
demanded
a
tax
of
five
dollars
the
house
furnished
with
these
mats
requires
little
else
with
which
to
begin
a
comfortable
house
fit
for
the
habitation
of
a
family
of
four
or
five
may
be
built
for
a
far
less
sum
of
money
and
the
fewness
and
cheapness
of
the
articles
necessary
to
furnish
it
surpass
belief
in
mentioning
such
a
modest
house
and
furnishing
the
reader
must
not
imagine
that
the
family
are
constrained
for
want
of
room
or
stinted
in
the
necessary
furniture
on
the
contrary
they
are
enabled
to
live
in
the
most
comfortable
manner
their
wants
are
few
and
their
tastes
are
simple
and
refined
they
live
without
the
slightest
ostentation
no
false
display
leads
them
into
criminal
debt
the
monstrous
bills
for
carpets

furniture

dishes
often
entailed
upon
young
at

in
any
attempt
at
premonition
even
of
such
bills
often
preventing
marriage
social
miseries
that
the
japanese
happily
know
but
little
about
simple
as
the
house
just
given
appears
to
be
there
is
quite
as
much
variety
in
the
arrangement
of
their
rooms
as
with
us
there
are
cheap
types
of
houses
in
japan
as
in
our
country
where
room
follows
room
in
a
certain
sequence
but
the
slightest
attention
to
these
matters
will
not
only
show
great
variety
in
their
plans
but
equally
great
variety
in
the
ornamental
finishing
of
their
apartments
the
plan
shown
in
is
that
of
the
house
represented
in
figs
and
the
details
are
figured
as
in
the
previous
plan
this
house
has
on
the
seven
rooms
besides
the
kitchen
hall
and
the
kitchen
and
are
indicated
as
in
the
former
plan
by
their
floors
being
ruled
in
wide
parallel
lines
lines
running
obliquely
as
in
the
former
case
indicating
the
or
the
owner
of
this
house
has
often
welcomed
me
to
its
soft
mats
and
quiet
atmosphere
and
in
the
enjoyment
of
them
i
have
often
wondered
as
to
the
impressions
one
would
get
if
he
could
be
suddenly
transferred
from
his
own
home
to
this
unpretentious
house
with
its
quaint
and
pleasant
surroundings
the
general
nakedness
or
rather
emptiness
of
the
apartments
would
be
the
first
thing
noticed
then
gradually
the
perfect
harmony
of
the
tinted
walls
with
the
wood
finish
would
be
observed
the
orderly
adjusted
screens
with
their
curious
or
conventional
designs
on
the
paper
of
so
subdued
and
intangible
a
character
that
special
attention
must
be
directed
to
them
to
perceive
their
nature
the
clean
and
comfortable
mats
everywhere
smoothly
covering
the
floor
the
natural
woods
composing
the
ceiling
and
the
structural
finishing
of
the
room
everywhere
apparent
the
customary
recesses
with
their
cupboard
and
shelves
and
the
lintel
with
its
elaborate
lattice
or
carving
above
these
would
leave
lasting
impressions
of
the
exquisite
taste
and
true
refinement
of
the
japanese
i
noticed
that
a
peculiarly
agreeable
odor
of
the
wood
used
in
the
structure
of
this
house
seemed
to
fill
the
air
of
the
rooms
with
a
a
delicate
perfume
and
in
this
connection
i
was
led
to
think
of
the
rooms
i
had
seen
in
america
encumbered
with
chairs
bureaus
tables
bedsteads
and
of
the
dusty
carpets
and
suffocating
hot
with
some
frantic
design
and
perforated
with
a
pair
of
quadrangular
openings
wholly
or
partially
closed
against
light
and
air
recalling
this
labyrinth
of
varnished
furniture
i
could
but
remember
how
much
work
is
entailed
upon
some
one
properly
to
attend
to
such
a
room
and
enjoying
by
contrast
the
fresh
air
and
broad
flood
of
light
limited
only
by
the
dimensions
of
the
room
which
this
japanese
house
afforded
i
could
not
recall
with
any
pleasure
the
stifling
apartments
with
which
i
had
been
familiar
at
home

if
a
foreigner
is
not
satisfied
with
the
severe
simplicity
and
what
might
at
first
strike
him
as
a
meagreness
in
the
appointments
of
a
japanese
house
and
is
nevertheless
a
man
of
taste
he
is
compelled
to
admit
that
its
paucity
of
furniture
and
carpets
spares
one
the
misery
of
certain
painful
feelings
that
incongruities
always
produce
he
recalls
with
satisfaction
certain
works
on
household
art
in
which
it
is
maintained
that
a
table
with
carved
cherubs
beneath
against
whose
absurd
contours
one
knocks
his
legs
is
an
abomination
and
that
carpets
which
have
depicted
upon
them
winged
angels
lions
or
tigers
worse
still
a
simpering
and
reddened
maiden
being
made
love
to
by
an
equally
ruddy
shepherd
hardly
the
proper
surfaces
to
tread
upon
with
comfort
though
one
may
take
a
certain
grim
delight
in
wiping
his
soiled
boots
upon
them
in
the
japanese
house
the
traveller
is
at
least
not
exasperated
with
such
a
medley
of
dreadful
things
he
is
certainly
spared
the
pains
that
civilized
styles
of
appointing
and
furnishing
often
produce
lowell
truthfully
remarks
on
the
waste
and
aimlessness
of
our
american
luxury
which
is
an
abject
enslavement
to
tawdry
we
are
digressing
however
in
the
plan
referred
to
an
idea
of
the
size
of
the
rooms
may
be
formed
by
observing
the
number
of
mats
in
each
room
and
recalling
the
size
of
the
mats
which
is
about
three
feet
by
six
it
will
be
seen
that
the
rooms
are
small
much
smaller
than
those
of
a
similar
class
of
american
houses
though
appearing
more
roomy
from
the
absence
of
furniture
the
three
rooms
bordering
the
verandah
and
facing
the
garden
are
readily
thrown
into
one
and
thus
a
continuous
apartment
is
secured
measuring
feet
in
length
by
twelve
in
width
and
this
is
uninterrupted
with
the
exception
of
one
small
partition
in
the
manner
of
building
one
recognizes
the
propriety
of
constructive
art
as
being
in
better
taste
and
in
a
japanese
house
one
sees
this
principle
carried
out
to
perfection
the
ceiling
of
boards
the
corner
posts
and
middle
posts
and
transverse
ties
are
in
plain
sight
the
corner
posts
which
support
the
roof
play
their
part
as
a
decorative
feature
as
they
pass
stoutly
upward
from
the
ground
beneath
a
fringe
of
rafters
rib
the
lower
surface
of
the
wide
overhanging
eaves
and
these
in
turn
rest
firmly
on
an
unhewn
beam
which
runs
as
a
girder
from
one
side
of
the
verandah
to
the
other
the
house
is
simply
charming
in
all
its
appointments
and
as
a
during
the
many
long
hot
months
it
is
incomparable
in
the
raw
and
rainy
days
of
winter
however
it
is
not
so
pleasant
at
least
to
a
foreigner
i
question
whether
to
a
japanese
it
is
more
unpleasant
than
the
ordinary
houses
at
home
are
with
us
with
some
of
the
apartments
hot
and
stifling
and
things
cracking
with
the
furnace
heat
while
other
parts
are
splitting
with
the
cold
with
gas
from
the
furnace
and
chimneys
that
often
refuse
to
draw
and
an
impalpable
though
tangible
soot
and
settling
on
every
object
and
many
other
abominations
that
are
too
well
known
the
japanese
do
not
suffer
from
the
cold
as
we
do
moreover
when
in
the
house
they
clothe
themselves
much
more
warmly
and
for
what
little
artificial
warmth
they
desire
small
receptacles
containing
charcoal
are
provided
over
which
they
warm
themselves
at
the
same
time
keeping
their
feet
warm
as
a
hen
does
her
eggs
by
sitting
on
them
their
indifference
to
cold
is
seen
in
the
fact
that
in
their
the
rooms
will
often
be
entirely
open
to
the
garden
which
may
be
glistening
with
a
fresh
snowfall
their
winters
are
of
course
much
milder
than
our
northern
winters
at
such
seasons
however
an
american
misses
in
japan
the
cheerful
open
fireplace
around
which
the
family
in
his
own
country
is
wont
to
gather
indeed
with
the
social
character
of
our
family
life
a
japanese
house
to
us
would
be
in
winter
comfortless
to
the
last
degree
the
differences
between
the
houses
of
the
nobles
and
the
are
quite
as
great
as
the
differences
between
these
latter
houses
and
the
rude
shelters
of
the
peasant
class
the
differences
between
the
interior
finish
of
the
houses
of
the
first
two
mentioned
classes
are
perhaps
not
so
marked
as
in
both
cases
clean
simplicity
of
style
and
purity
of
finish
are
aimed
at
but
the
house
of
the
noble
is
marked
by
a
grander
entrance
a
far
greater
extent
of
rooms
and
passages

the
punctilious
way
in
which

by
the
daimio
is
indicated
by
a
curious
modification
of
the
floor
of
one
of
a
suite
of
rooms
which
is
raised
a
few
inches
above

a
more
minute
description
of
the
mats
may
be
given
at
this
point
a
brief
allusion
has
already
been
made
to
them
in
the
remarks
on
construction
these
mats
or
are
made
very
carefully
of
straw
matted
and
bound
together
with
stout
string
to
the
thickness
of
two
inches
or
more
upper
surface
being
covered
with
a
precisely
like
the
canton
matting
we
are
familiar
with
though
in
the
better
class
of
mats
of
a
little
finer
quality
the
edges
are
trimmed
true
and
square
and
the
two
longer
sides
are
bordered
on
the
upper
surface
and
edge
with
a
strip
of
black
linen
an
inch
or
more
in
width
the
making
of
mats
is
quite
a
separate
trade
from
that
of
making
the
with
which
they
are
covered
the
may
often
be
seen
at
work
in
front
of
his
door
crouching
down
to
a
low
frame
upon
which
the
mat
rests
fig
fig
as
we
have
before
remarked
the
architect
invariably
plans
his
rooms
to
accommodate
a
certain
number
of
mats
and
since
these
mats
have
a
definite
size
any
indication
on
the
plan
of
the
number
of
mats
a
room
is
to
contain
gives
at
once
its
dimensions
also
the
mats
are
laid
in
the
following
numbers
three
four
and
six
eight
ten

fourteen
sixteen
and
so
on
in
the
room
the
mats
are
laid
side
by
side
in
the
room
the
mats
may
be
laid
side
by
side
or
two
mats
in
one
way
and
the
third
mat
crosswise
at
the
end
in
the
four
and
mat
room
the
mats
are
laid
with
the
in
one
corner
the
six
and
eight
mat
rooms
are
the
most
rooms
and
this
gives
some
indication
of
the
small
size
of
the
ordinary
japanese
room
and
house
room
being
about
nine
feet
by
twelve
the
room
being
twelve
by
twelve
and
the
room
being

the
accompanying
sketch
shows
the
usual
arrangements
for
these
mats
fig

mats
in

in
adjusting
mats
to
the
floor
the
corners
of
four
mats
are
never
allowed
to
come
together
but
are
arranged
so
that
the
corners
of
two
mats
abut
against
the
side
of
a
third
they
are
supposed
to
be
arranged
in
the
direction
of
a
spiral
see
dotted
line
in
the
edges
of
the
longer
sides
of
the
ordinary
mats
are
bound
with
a
narrow
strip
of
black
linen
as
before
remarked
in
the
houses
of
the
nobles
this
border
strip
has
figures
worked
into
it
in
black
and
white
as
may
be
seen
by
reference
to
japanese
illustrated
books
showing
interiors
these
mats
fit
tightly
and
the
floor
upon
which
they
rest
never
being
in
sight
is
generally
made
of
rough
boards
with
open
joints
the
mat
as
you
step
upon
it
yields
slightly
to
the
pressure
of
the
foot
and
old
mats
get
to
be
slightly
uneven
and
somewhat
hard
from
continual
use
from
the
nature
of
this
floor
shoes
are
never
worn
upon
it
japanese
invariably
leaving
their
wooden
clogs
outside
the
house
either
on
the
or
on
the
at
the
entrance
the
wearing
of
one
s
shoes
in
the
house
is
one
of
the
many
coarse
and
rude
ways
in
which
a
foreigner
is
likely
to
offend
these
people
the
hard
heels
of
a
boot
or
shoe
not
only
leave
deep
indentations
in
the
upper
matting
but
oftentimes
break
through
happily
however
the
act
of
removing
one
s
shoes
on
entering
the
house
is
one
of
the
very
few
customs
that
foreigners
recognize
necessity
of
compliance
being
too
obvious
to
dispute
in
or
during
a
rain
of
long
duration
the
mats
become
damp
and
musty
and
when
a
day
of
sunshine
comes
they
are
taken
up
and
stacked
like
cards
in
front
of
the
house
to
dry
they
are
also
removed
at
times
and
well
beaten
their
very
nature
affords
abundant
for
fleas
which
are
the
unmitigated
misery
of
foreigners
who
travel
in
japan
though
even
this
annoyance
is
generally
absent
in
private
houses
of
the
better
classes
as
is
the
case
with
similar
pests
in
our
country
upon
these
mats

people
eat
sleep
and
die

represent
the
bed

sometimes

the

of
the
legs

sides

toes

the
upper
and
outer
part
of
the
instep

directly

the
mats

a
woman
in
the
attitude

sitting
in
old
people
one
often
notices
a
callosity
on
that
part
of
the
foot
which
comes
in
contact
with
the
mat
and
but
for
a
knowledge
of
the
customs
of
the
people
in
this
matter
might
well
wonder
how
such
a
hardening
of
the
flesh
could
occur
in
such
an
odd
place
this
position
is
so
painful
to
a
foreigner
that
it
is
only
with
a
great
deal
of
practice
he
can
become
accustomed
to
it
even
the
japanese
who
have
been
abroad
for
several
years
find
it
excessively
difficult
and
painful
to
resume
this
habit
in
this
attitude
the
japanese
receive
their
company
is
unknown
but
bows
of
various
degrees
of
profundity
are
made
by
placing
the
hands
together
upon
the
mats
and
bowing
until
the
head
oftentimes
touches
the

this
ceremony

reference
has
already
been
made
to
the
sliding
screens
and
as
they
form
so
important
and
distinct
a
feature
in
the
japanese
house
a
more
special
description
of
them
is
necessary
in
our
american
houses
a
lintel
is
the
horizontal
beam
placed
over
the
door
this
is
cased
with
wood
and
has
a
jamb
or
recess
corresponding
to
the
vertical
recesses
into
which
the
door
shuts
for
the
sake
of
clearness
we
may
imagine
a
lintel
running
entirely
across
the
room
from
one
corner
to
the
other
and
this
is
the
of
the
japanese
room
the
beam
is
not
cased
on
its
under
surface
run
two
deep
and
closely
parallel
grooves
and
directly
beneath
this
on
the
floor
a
surface
of
wood
shows
in
which
are
two
exceedingly
shallow
grooves
this
surface
is
level
with
the
mats
and
in
these
grooves
the
screens
run
the
grooves
in
the
are
made
deep
in
order
that
the
screens
may
be
lifted
out
of
the
and
then
dropped
from
the
upper
ones
and
thus
removed
in
this
way
a
suite
of
rooms
can
be
quickly
turned
into
one
by
the
removal
of
the
screens
the
grooves
are
sufficiently
wide
apart
to
permit
the
screens
being
pushed
by
each
other
from
the
adjustable
nature
of
these
sliding
partitions
one
may
have
the
opening
between
the
rooms
of
any
width
he
desires
fig
through
verandah
and
fig
through
verandah
and
there
are
two
forms
of
these
sliding
screens
one
kind
called
forming
the
partitions
between
rooms
the
other
kind
called
coming
on
the
outer
sides
of
the
rooms
next
to
the
verandah
and
forming
the
substitutes
for
windows
the
forming
the
movable
partitions
between
the
rooms
are
covered
on
both
sides
with
thick
paper
and
as
it
was
customary
in
past
times
to
use
chinese
paper
for
this
purpose
these
devices
are
also
called
kami
the
frame
is
not
unlike
the
frame
used
for
the
outside
screens
consisting
of
thin
vertical
and
horizontal
strips
of
wood
forming
a
grating
with
the
meshes
four
or
five
inches
in
width
and
two
inches
in
height
the
outside
frame
or
border
is
usually
left
plain
as
is
the
case
with
most
of
their
it
is
not
uncommon
however
to
see
these
frames
lacquered
the
material
used
for
covering
them
consists
of
a
stout
thick
and
durable
paper
and
this
is
often
richly
decorated
sometimes
a
continuous
scene
will
stretch
like
a
panorama
across
the
whole
side
of
a
room
the
old
castles
contain
some
celebrated
paintings
on
these
by
famous
artists
the
use
of
heavy
in
combination
with
the
paintings
produces
a
decorative
effect
rich
beyond
description
in
the
commoner
houses
the
are
often
undecorated
save
by
the
paper
which
covers
them
and
the
material
for
this
purpose
is
infinite
in
its
variety
kinds
being
curiously
wrinkled
other
kinds
seeming
to
have
interwoven
in
their
texture
the
delicate
green
threads
of
some
weed
while
other
kinds
still
will
have
the
rich
brown
sheaths
of
bamboo
shoots
worked
into
the
paper
producing
a
quaint
and
pleasing
effect
often
the
paper
is
perfectly
plain
and
if
by
chance
an
artist
friend
comes
to
the
house
he
is
asked
to
leave
some
little
sketch
upon
these
surfaces
as
a
memento
of
his
visit
others
perhaps
may
have
already
covered
portions
of
the
surface
with
some
landscape
or
spray
of
flowers
in
old
inns
one
has
often
pointed
out
to
him
the
work
of
some
famous
artist
who
probably
paid
his
score
in
this
way
while
the
are
almost
invariably
covered
with
thick
and
opaque
paper
it
occurs
sometimes
that
light
is
required

a

upper
and

third
of
the
retains
its

paper

which
light
enters

it
can
be
with
paper
when
required
this
is
often
made
in
ornamental
patterns
geometrical
or
natural
designs
being
common
in
summer
another
kind
of
frame
may
be
substituted
in
the
termed
a
in
which
a
kind
of
rush
called
takes
the
place

the
size
of
an
ordinary
straw
and
having
a
warm
brown
tint
this
is
employed
in
many
ways
in
the
decoration
of
interiors
and
the
use
of
so
fragile

one
of
the
many
indications

the
one
shown
in

the
opening
which
leads
from
the

to

delights
in

find
full
play

the
details

a
room
in
so
far
as
a
description
of

were
concerned
since
a
general
idea
of
the
interior
could
not

understood
without
clearly
understanding
the
nature
of
those
objects
which
form
inseparable
elements
of
every
japanese
room
and
which
are
so
unlike
anything
to
which
we
are
accustomed
having
given
these
features
it
may
be
well
to
glance
at
a
general
view
of
the
few
typical
rooms
before
examining
farther
into
the
details
of
their
finish
the
room
shown
in
gives
a
fair
idea
of
the
appearance
of
the
with
its
two
bays

recesses

which
the
is
a

recess

at

its

supposed
to
have
been
anciently
used

the
let
us
pause
for
a
moment
to
consider
the
peculiar
features
of
this
room
the
partition
separating
the
two
recesses
has
for
its
post
a
stick
of
timber
from
which
the
bark
only
has
been
removed
and
this
post
or
as
it
is
called
is
almost
invariably
a
stick
of
wood
in
its
natural
state
or
with
the
bark
only
removed
and
if
it
is
gnarled
or
tortuous
in
grain
or
if
it
presents
knots
or
burls
it
is
all
the
more
desirable
sometimes
the
post
may
be
hewn
in
such
a
way
that
in
section
it
has
an
octagonal
form
cutting
being
done
in
broad
scarfs
giving
it
a
peculiar
appearance
as
shown
in
sometimes
the
post
may
have
one
or
two
branches
above
which
are
worked
into
the
structure
as
an
ornamental
feature
the
ceiling
of
the
is
usually
if
not
always
flush
with
the
ceiling
of
the
room

that
of

much
lower
the
floor
of
the
is
higher
than
that
of
the
and
its
sill
may
be
rough
or
finished
and
even
when
finished
squarely
some
natural
surface
may
be
left
through
the
curvature
of
the
stick
from
which
it
has
been
hewn
and
which
had
been
selected
for
this
very
peculiarity
feature
by
the
way
that
our
carpenters
would
regard
as
a
blemish

floor

every

shown
in

the
of
this

this
room
illustrates
very
clearly
a
peculiar
feature
in
japanese
decoration
of
avoiding
as
far
as
possible
symmetry
here
are
two
rooms
of
the
same
size
and
shape
the
only
difference
consisting
in
the
farther
room
having
two
recesses
while
the
room
nearer
has
a
large
closet
closed
by
sliding
screens
it
will
be
observed
however
that
in
the
farther
room
the
narrow
strips
of
wood
upon
which
the
boards
of
the
ceiling
rest
run
parallel
to
the
while
in
the
nearer
room
the
strips
run
at
right
angles
the
mats
in
the
two
rooms
while
arranged
in
the
usual
manner
for
an
room
are
placed
in
opposite
ways
that
is
to
say
as
the
mats
in
front
of
the
and
are
always
parallel
to
these
recesses
the
other
mats
are
arranged
in
accordance
with
these
in
the
room
coming
next
the
arrangement
of
mats
while
being
the
same
have
the
two
mats
running
parallel
to
the
line
dividing
the
rooms
and
of
course
the
other
mats
in
accordance
with
these
this
asymmetry
is
carried
out
of
course
in
the
two
recesses
which
are
unlike
in
every
detail
floors
as
well
as
the
lower
borders
of
their
hanging
partitions
being
at
different
levels
and
in
the
details
of
the
symmetrical
arrangement
is
almost
invariably
avoided
the
little
closet
on
the
floor
being
at
one
side
while
a
shelf
supported
on
a
single
prop
runs
from
the
corner
of
this
closet
to
the
other
side
of
the
recess
and
if
another
shelf
is
added
this
is
arranged
in
an
equally
unsymmetrical
manner
in
fact
everywhere
in
mats
ceiling
and
other
details
a
symmetry
is
carefully
avoided
how
different
has
been
the
treatment
of
similar
features
in
the
finish
of
american
rooms
everywhere
in
our
apartments
halls
inside
and
out
a
monotonous
symmetry
is
elaborated
to
the
minutest
particular
even
to
bracket
and
notch
in
pairs
the
fireplace
is
in
the
middle
of
the
room
the
mantel
and
all
the
work
about
this
opening
duplicated
with
painful
accuracy
on
each
side
of
a
median
line
every
ornament
on
the
is
in
pairs
and
these
are
arranged
in
the
same
way
a
single
object
like
a
french
clock
is
adjusted
in
the
dead
centre
of
this
shelf
so
that
each
half
of
the
mantel
shall
get
its
half
of
a
clock
a
pair
of
andirons
below
and
portraits
of
ancestral
progenitors
on
each
side
above
keep
up
this
intolerable
monotony
and
opposite
two
windows
with
draped
curtains
parted
right
and
left
and
a
symmetrical
table
or
cabinet
between
the
two
are
in
rigid
adherence
to
this
senseless
scheme
and
outside
the
monotony
is
still
more
dreadful
even
to
the
fences
and
indeed
false
windows
are
introduced
in
adherence
to
this
inane
persistency
in
traditional
methods
within
ten
years
some
progress
has
been
made
among
the
better
class
of
american
houses
in
breaking
away
from
this
false
and
tiresome
idea
and
our
houses
look
all
the
prettier
for
these
changes
in
decoration
as
well
we
have
made
great
strides
in
the
same
direction

to
the
influence
of
japanese
methods

the
general
description

how
very

of
the
various
forms
of

connected
with
these
observances
and
indeed
another
volume
might
be
filled
with
the
minor
details
associated
with
their
different
schools

the
party
comes
about
by
the
host
inviting
a
company
of
four
to
attend
the
and
in
their
presence
making
the
tea
in
a
bowl
after
certain
prescribed
forms
and
offering
it
to
the
guests
to
be
more
explicit
as
to
the
mode
of
conducting
this
ceremony
tea
is
first
prepared
by
grinding
it
to
a
fine
almost
impalpable
powder
this
may
be
done
by
a
servant
before
the
assemblage
of
the
guests
or
may
be
ordered
ground
from
a
tea
shop
indeed
the
host
may
grind
it
himself
this
material
always
freshly
ground
for
each
party
is
usually
kept
in
a
little
earthen
jar
having
an
ivory
cover
of
the
collector
may
also
be
used
for
this
purpose
the
principal
utensils
used
in
the
ceremony
consist
of
a
or
made
of
pottery
or
use
may
be
made
of
a
depression
in
the
floor
partially
filled
with
ashes
in
which
the
charcoal
may
be
placed
an
iron
kettle
to
boil
the
water
in
a
bamboo
dipper
of
the
most
delicate
construction
to
dip
out
the
water
a
jar
from
which
to

the
water

a
bowl
in

the
tea
is
made

powdered
tea
a
bamboo
stirrer
not
unlike
certain
forms
of
beaters
by
which
the
tea
is
briskly
stirred
after
the
hot
water
has
been
added
a
square
silk
cloth
with
which
to
wipe
the
jar
and
spoon
properly

little
rest
for
the
cover

pottery
or

of
bamboo
a
shallow
vessel
in
which
the
rinsings
of
the

poured
after
washing
a
brush
consisting
of
three
feathers
of
the
eagle
or
some
other
large
bird
to
dust
the
edge
of
the

finally
a
shallow
basket
in
which
is
not
only
charcoal
to
replenish
the
fire
but
a
pair
of
metal
rods
or
to
handle
the
coal
two
interrupted
metal
rings
by
which
the
kettle
is
lifted
off
the
fire
a
circular
mat
upon
which
the
kettle
is
placed
and
a
small
box
containing
incense
or
bits
of
wood
that
give
out
a
peculiar
fragrance
when
burned
with
the
exception
of
the
and
an
iron
kettle
all
these
utensils
have
to
be
brought
in
by
the
host
with
great
formality
and
in
a
certain
sequence
and
placed
with
great
precision
upon
the
mats
after
the
prescribed
rules
of
certain
schools
in
the
making
of
the
tea
the
utensils
are
used
in
a
most
exact
and
formal
manner
the
making
of
the
tea
watched
by
one
knowing
nothing
about
the
ceremony
seems
as
grotesque
a
performance
as
one
can
well
imagine
many
of
the
forms
connected
with
it
seem
uselessly
absurd
and
yet
having
taken
many
lessons
in
the
art
of
i
found
that
with
few
exceptions
it
was
natural
and
easy
and
the
guests
assembled
on
such
an
occasion
though
at
first
sight
appearing
stiff
are
always
perfectly
at
their
ease
the
proper
placing
of
the
utensils
and
the
sequence
in
handling
them
and
making
the
tea
are
all
natural
and
easy
movements
as
i
have
said
the
light
wiping
of
the
and
the
washing
of
the
bowl
and
its
wiping
with
so
many
peripheral
jerks
the
dropping
of
the
stirrer
against
the
side
of
the
bowl
with
a
click
in
rinsing
and
a
few
of
the
other
usual
movements
are
certainly
grotesquely
formal
enough
but
i
question
whether
the
etiquette
of
a
ceremonious
at
home
with
the
decorum
observed
in
the
proper
use
of
each
utensil
does
not
strike
a
japanese
as
equally
odd
and
incomprehensible
when
experienced
by
him
for
the
first
time
this
very
brief
and
imperfect
allusion
has
been
made
in
order
to
explain
that
so
highly
do
the
japanese
regard
this
ceremony
that
little
isolated
houses
are
specially
constructed
for
the
express
purpose
of
entertaining
if
no
house
is
allotted
for
the
purpose
then
a
special
room
is
fitted
for
it
many
books
are
devoted
to
the
exposition
of
the
different
schools
of
illustrated
with
diagrams
showing
the
various
ways
of
placing
the
utensils
plans
of
the
and
all
the
details
involved
in
the
observances
the
have
had
a
profound
influence
on
many
japanese
arts
particularly
have
they
affected
the
pottery
of
japan
for
the
rigid
simplicity
approaching
an
affected
roughness
and
poverty
which
characterizes
the
and
many
of
the
utensils
used
in
the
ceremony
has
left
its
impress
upon
many
forms
of
pottery
it
has
also
had
an
influence
on
even
the
few
rustic
and
simple
adornments
allowed
in
the
room
and
has
held
its
sway
over
the
gardens
gateways
and
fences
surrounding
the
house
indeed
it
has
had
an
effect
on
the
japanese
almost
equal
to
that
of
calvinistic
doctrines
on
the
early
puritans
the
one
suppressed
the
exuberance
of
an
people
and
brought
many
of
their
decorative
impulses
down
to
a
restful
purity
and
simplicity
but
in
the
case
of
the
puritans
and
their
immediate
descendants
who
had
but
little
of
the
to
spare
their
sombre
dogmas
crushed
the
little
love
for
art
that
might
have
dawned
and
rendered
intolerably
woful
and
sepulchral
the
lives
and
homes
of
our
ancestors
and
when
some
faint
groping
for
art
and
adornment
here
and
there
appeared
it
manifested
itself
only
in
wretched
samplers
and
hideous

it

at
that

extremely
ornate

the
owner
of

had
built
it
some
thirty
years

had
intended
carrying
out
chinese

he
had
got
his
ideas

them

certain
it

that
although

had
worked

a
number
of
features
actually
brought

i
must
say
that
in
my
limited
observations
in

country
i
saw
nothing
approaching
such
an
interior

the
effect
of
the
room
was
certainly
charming
and
the
most
elaborate
finish
with
expensive
woods
had
been
employed
in
its
construction
it
seemed
altogether
too
ornamental

the

unique

the

the

an

the

the
fact
that
old

not

represent

special

got
from
this
scholar
the
first
rational
explanation
of
the
meaning
of
the
two
narrow
bands
which
hang
down
from
the
upper
part
of
the
usual
form
of
a
japanese
picture
that
these
were
survivals
of
useful
appendages
organs
so
to
speak
there
could
be
no
doubt
me
that
in
former
times
the
pictures
mainly
of
a
religious
character
were
suspended
from
a
frame
long
bands
trailed
down
behind
the
picture
and
shorter
ones
so
as
not
to
obscure
it
hung
down

when
the
picture
was
rolled
up
it
was
held
in
position
by
tying
these
bands
when
the
custom
came
to
hang
these
pictures
permanently
against
the
wall
the
long
bands
were
finally
discarded
while
the
shorter
ones
in
front
survived
in
old
books
there
are
illustrated
methods
by
which
screens
hanging
on

were
tied

the
short

curiously
enough
the
bands
on
a
are
called

which
literally
means
this
is
the
explanation
given
me
but
it
is
quite
probable
that
large
pictures
hanging
against
the
walls
when
disturbed
by
the
wind
were
tied
up

true
that
the

to
cover
are
small
yet
the
designs
which
may
be

designs

have
a
strength
and
prominence
not
shown

the

as
we
have
seen
is
a
beam
that
runs
entirely
across
the
side
of
the
room
at
the
height
of
nearly
six
feet
from
the
floor
on
its
under
surface
are
the
grooves
in
which
the
run
between
this
beam
and
the
ceiling
is
a
space
of
two
feet
or
more
depending
of
course
upon
the
height
of
the
room
the
height
of
the
beam
itself
from
the
floor
a
nearly
constant
factor
is
always
lower
than
are
our
doorways
because
the
average
height
of
the
japanese
people
is
less
than
ours
and
aggravatingly
low
to
many
foreigners
is
this
beam
as
can
be
attested
by
those
who
have
cracked
their
heads
against
it
in
passing
from
one
room
to
another
the
space
between
the
and
the

is
called
the
and
offers
another
field
for
the
exercise
of
that
decorative
faculty
which
comes
so
naturally
to
the
japanese
this
space
may
be
occupied
simply
by
a
closed
plastered
partition
just
as
in
our
houses
we
invariably
fill
up
a
similar
space
which
comes
over
wide
folding
doors
between
a
suite
of
rooms
in

it
is

to

this
space

noticed
that
in
quite
old
houses
the
was
of
this
description
in
an
old
house
at
yatsushiro
in
higo
i
saw
a
very
beautiful
form
of
this
nature
the
was
divided
into
two
panels
and
the
design
was
continuous
from
one
panel
to
the
other

represented
a
rustic
method
of
conducting
water

means
of
wooden
troughs
propped
up

decay

remarkably
well

the
plank
out
of
which
the
design
was
wrought
must
have
been
less
than
an
inch
in
thickness
and
yet
the
effect
of
relief
was
surprising
a
white
substance
like
chalk
filled
the
interstices
of
the
carving
giving
the
appearance
that
at
one
time
the
whole
design
had
been
whitened
and
the
coloring
matter
had
subsequently
worn
away
the
house
was
quite
old
and
the
work
had
been
done
by
a
local
artist
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
and
one
well
worth
calling
attention
to
that
in
the
smaller
towns
and
villages
in
regions
far
apart
there
seem
to
be
artistic
workmen
capable
of
designing
and
executing
these
graceful
and
artistic
carvings
such
they
certainly
are
everywhere
throughout
the
empire
we
find
good
work
of
all
kinds
and
evidence
that
workmen
of
all
crafts
have
their
trades
served
them
are
employed
at
home
in
other
words
the
people
everywhere
appreciate
artistic
designs
and
the
proper
execution
of
them
and
consequently
men
capable
in
their
various
lines
find
their
services
in
demand
wherever
they
may
be
i
do
not
mean
to
imply
by
this
general
statement
that
good
workmen
in
japan
are
not
drawn
to
the
larger
cities
for
employment
but
rather
that
the
smaller
towns
and
villages
everywhere
are
not
destitute
of
such
a
class
and
that
the
distribution
of
such
artisans
is
far
more
wide
and
general
than
with
us
and
how
different
such
conditions
are
with
us
may
be
seen
in
the
fact
that
there
are
hundreds
of
towns
and
thousands
of
villages
in
our
country
where
the
carpenter
is
just
capable
of
making
a
shelter
from
the
weather
and
if
he
attempts
to
beautify
we
will
not
awaken
the
recollection
of
those
startling
horrors
of
petticoat
scallops
fringing
the
eaves
and
every
opening
and
rendered
if
possible
more
hideous
by
the
painter
throughout
the
breadth
and
length
of
that
land
of
million
people
men
capable
of
artistic
work
and
people
capable
of
appreciating
such
work
abound
in
our
land
of
millions
one
has
to
seek
the
great
centres
of
population
for
similar
work
elsewhere
the
good
work
and
its
appreciation
are
exceptional
at
nagoya
in
the
house
of
a
poor
man
i

a
simple
and
ingenious

two
thin
boards
one
of
light
and
the
other
of

cedar
had
been
cut
in
the
form

contours
these
were
placed
in
juxtaposition

from

side
the
appearance
of

was
conveyed

are
many
suggestions

one
of
the

that
strike
a

now
of

the
reason
of
this
is
that
the
people
have
never
developed
the
miserly
spirit
of
hoarding

rubbish
with
the
idea
that
some
day
it
may
come
into

this
spirit
when
developed

mania

necessary
articles

polish
applied
to
its
surface
but
found
none
inquiry
brought
out
the
curious
information
that
the
water
from
the
bath
is
often
used
to
moisten
the
cloth
with
which
the
wood
is
wiped

evidently
the
sebaceous
secretions

the

had
much
to

nevertheless
i
dare
to

that
there

no

by

assertion
i
do
not

to
suggest
that
we
shall
forthwith
proceed
to
establish
baths
after
the
japanese
style
and
take
them
after
the
japanese
fashion
the
japanese
as
well
as
other
eastern
people
have
for
centuries
been
accustomed
to
see
nakedness
without
its
provoking
among
them
the
slightest
attention
or
in
any
way
suggesting
immodesty
with
us
on
the
contrary
the
effect
has
been
different

the
dire
result
is
seen
in
the
almost
utter
extinction
in
our
country
of
the
classical
drama
and
the
substitution
therefor
of
and
burlesques
anything
in
fact
that
shall
present
to
the
vulgar
gaze
of
thousands
the
female
form
in
scanty
apparel
a
turkish
woman
looks
upon
her
christian
sister
as
not
only
immodest
and
vulgar
but
absolutely
immoral
because
she
unblushingly
parades
the
public
street
with
a
naked
face
but
the
christian
woman
knows
that
the
established
customs
of
her
country
sanction
such
an
exposure
as
entirely
proper
a
girl
who
in
our
country
would
deem
it
immodest
to
appear
among
the
members
of
her
own
family
in
a
de
chambre
and
yet
under
the
glare
of
a
bright
in
the

of
scores
of
strangers

committing
an
act
which
to
a
turkish
woman
would
appear
inexplicable
to
a
japanese
the
sight
of
our
dazzling
with
girls
in
dresses
clasped
in
the
arms
of
their
partners
and
whirling
to
the
sound
of
exciting
music
must
seem
the
wildest
debauch
imaginable
for
in

lower
classes

and

parties

boys

known
there
no
no
friendly
kiss
if
the
japanese
visitor
in
this
country
is
a
minded
and
witless
scribbler
he
will
probably
startle
his
friends
at
home
with
accounts
of
the
grossly
immoral
character
of
christians
unfamiliar
as
he
is
with
the
corner
loafer
eying
every
girl
that
walks
by
or
with
that
class
which
throng
our
walks
with
the
sole
purpose
of
staring
at
the
girls
who
are
there
for
the
purpose
of
being
stared
at
what
must
he
think
of
our
people
when
he
visits
our
summer
resorts
at
the
seaside
and
sees
a
young
swarms
of
over
the
sand
under
a
bright
sun
clad
only
in
a
single
wrapper
which
when
wet
clings
to
her
form
and
renders
her
an
object
of
contemplation
to
a
battalion
of
young
men
who
fringe
the
beach
in
japan
among
the
lower
classes
the
sexes
bathe
together
but
with
a
modesty
and
propriety
that
are
inconceivable
to
a
foreigner
until
he
has
witnessed
it
though
naked
there
is
no
indecent
exposure
of
the
person
while
in
the
bath
they
are
absorbed
in
their
work
and
though
chatting
and
laughing
seem
utterly
unmindful
of
each
other
the
grossest
libels
have
been
written
about
the
japanese
in
reference
to
their
custom
of
public
bathing
and
i
hazard
the
statement
without
fear
of
contradiction
that
an
intelligent
japanese
seeing
many
of
our
customs
for
the
first
time
without
knowing
the
conditions
under
which
they
had
grown
up
would
find
infinitely
more
to
condemn
as
immodest
than
an
intelligent
foreigner
would
find
in
seeing
for
the
first
time
certain
japanese
customs
with
the
same
ignorance
at
the
outset
as
to
what
such
customs
implied
if
cleanliness
is
next
to
godliness
then
verily
the
japanese
are
a
godly
race
the
simple
statement
without
qualification
that
numbers
of
japanese
in
their
public
baths
bathe
in
the
same
water
would
seem
a
filthy
habit
certainly
if
such
a
statement
were
really
true
in
regard
to
our
own
lower
classes
it
would
be
a
most
filthy
habit
when
it
is
understood
however
that
the
japanese
working
as
the
carpenters
masons
and
bathe
two
or
three
times
a
day
and
must
of
necessity
enter
the
bath
in
a
state
of
cleanliness
such
as
our
workmen
rarely
if
ever
attain
the
statement
loses
some
of
its
force
when
it
is
further
added
that
these
people
do
not
wash
in
the
baths
but
boil
or
soak
in
them
for
a
while
and
then
upon
a
platform
with
an
extra
bucket
of
water
and
a
towel
wash
and
dry
themselves
the
filthy
character
of
this
performance
assumes
quite
another
aspect
a
japanese
familiar
with
his
airy
and
like
theatres
his
public
readings
under
an
open
structure
or
gatherings
in
a
room
in
which
one
or
all
sides
may
be
open
to
the
air
even
in
would
look
upon
the
usual
public
gatherings
of
our
people
in
schoolrooms
and
other
closed
apartments
wherein
the
air
often
becomes
so
foul
that
people
faint
and
struggle
to
the
door
to
get
a
breath
of
fresh
air
japanese
i
say
would
justly
look
upon
such
practices
as
filthy
to
the
last
degree
and
what
he
say
to
one
of
our
great
political
meetings
for
example
where
a
vast
unwashed
herd
of
perspiring
and
excited
people
actually
bathe
their
delicate
membranous
lungs
in
the
combined
breath
of
hundreds
the
public
baths
however
do
not
concern
us
it
may
be
well
to
contrast
our
country
with
japan
in
this
respect
where
in
the
latter
country
every
village
and
every
town
and
in
the
city
nearly
every
square
possess
public
baths
where
for
the
price
of
a
cent
or
two
one
may
find
conveniences
for
a
hot
bath
while
in
our
country
public
baths
are
only
found
in
the
larger
cities
and
few
of
these
even
can
boast
of
such
a
luxury
as
for
the
private
houses
in
our
country
where
bathing
is
customary
an
inquiry
shows
that
few
possess
the
convenience
of
a
tub
among
the
masses
of
our
people
a
wash
may
or
may
not
be
enforced
when
it
is
this
performance
usually
takes
place
in
the
kitchen
with
hot
water
furnished
from
the
kettle
but
in
japan
nearly
every
house
among
the
higher
and
middle
classes
possesses
the
most
ample
arrangements
for
hot
baths
and
even
among
the
poorer
classes
in
the
country
as
well
as

as
an
illustration
of
the
value
of
this

for
agricultural
purposes
i
was
told
that
in

in
the
renting
of
the
poorer
tenement
houses
if
three
persons
occupied
a
room
together
the
sewage
paid
the
rent
of

and
if
five
occupied
the

room
no
rent
was
charged
indeed
the
immense
value
and
importance
of
this
material
is
so
great
to
the
japanese
farmer
who
depends
entirely
upon
it
for
the
enrichment
of
his
soil
that
in
the
country
personal
conveniences
for
travellers
are
always
arranged

in
shape
of
buckets
or
sunk
in
the
ground
judging
by
our
standards
of
modesty
in
regard
to
these
matters
there
would
appear
to
be
no
evidence
of
delicacy
among
the
japanese
respecting
them
or
to
be
more
just
perhaps
should
say
that
there
is
among
them
no
affectation
of
false
modesty
feeling
which
seems
to
have
developed
among
the
people
more
exclusively
and
among
some
of
them
to
such
ridiculous
heights
of
absurdity
as
often
to
be
fraught
with
grave
consequences
but
among
the
japanese
it
would
seem
as
if
the
publicity
given
by
them
to
the
collecting
of
this
important
fertilizer
had
dulled
all
sensitiveness
on
their
part
if
it
ever
existed
concerning
this
matter
indeed
privacy
in
this
matter
would
be
impossible
when
it
is
considered
that
in
in
tokio
for
nearly
a
million
of
inhabitants
this
material
is
carried
off
daily
to
the
farms
outside
the
vessels
in
which
it
is
conveyed
being
long
cylindrical
buckets
borne
by
men
and
horses
if
sensitive
persons
are
offended
by
these
conditions
they
must
admit
that
the
secret
of
sewage
disposal
has
been
effectually
solved
by
the
japanese
for
centuries
so
that
nothing
goes
to
waste
and
of
equal
importance
too
is
it
that
of
that
class
of
diseases
which
scourge
our
communities
as
a
result
of
our
ineffectual
efforts
in
disposing
of
sewage
the
japanese
happily
know
but
little
in
that
country
there
are
no
deep
vaults
with
long
accumulations
contaminating
the
ground
or
underground
pipes
conducting
sewage
to
shallow
bays
and
inlets
there
to
fester
and
vitiate
the
air
and
spread
sickness
and
death
on
the
other
hand
it
must
be
admitted
that
their
water
supply
is
very
seriously
affected
by
this
sewage
being
washed
into
rivers
and
wells
from
the
where
it
is
deposited
and
the
scourge
of
cholera
which
almost
yearly
spreads
its
desolating
shadow
over
many
of
their
southern
towns
is
due
to
the
almost
universal
cultivation
of
the
land
by
irrigation
methods
and
the
consequent
distribution
of
sewage
through
these
surface
avenues
renders
it

protect
the

is
not

absolutely
useless

so

is
difficult
to
conceive
of
a

without
some
such
distinctive
characters
to
its
portal
in
the
ordinary
japanese
house
however
we
often
look
in

for
such
indications
in
the
common
class
of
their
houses

even
in

idea
of
this

its
relation
to

are
various
ways
of
treating
this

it
is
always
supported
on
wooden
posts
rough

hewn

partly
buried
in

the

almost
invariably
left
open
as
will
be
seen
by
reference
to
figs
and
pages
though
in
kioto
houses
it
is
sometimes
filled
up
by
simple
boarding
or
panelling
and
here
and
there
are
one
or
more
panels
which
run
back
and
forth
in
grooves
so
that
one
can
go
beneath
the
house
if
necessary
the
planks
composing
the
floor
of
the
verandah
may
be
narrow
or
wide
usually
however
they
are
quite
narrow
and
run
parallel
with
the
edge
of
the
verandah
though
in
some
cages
they
are
wide
planks
running
at
right
angles
when
this
platform
turns
a
corner
the
ends
of
the
planks
may
be
mitred
as
in
a
or
square
as
in

in
which
latter
case
the
ends
project

the
edges

chamfered

rounded

in
this
style
a
considerable

left

the
effect

this

picturesque

that
in

special
names
either
derived
from
their
form
or
the
substances
from
which
they
are
made
thus
a
little
ornamental
fence
that
juts
out
from
the
side
of
a
house
or
wall
is
called
a
meaning
sleeve
and
fence
the
form
of
the
fence
having
a
fanciful
resemblance
to
the
curious
long
sleeve
of
a
japanese
dress
a
fence
made
out
of
bamboo
is
called
a
while
a
fence
made
out
of
the
perfumed
wood
from
which
the
toothpicks
are
made
is
called
a
and
so
on
there
are
many
different
groups
of
japanese
fences
under
one
group
may
be
mentioned
all
those
enclosing
the
ground
upon
which
the
house
stands
in
the
city
these
are
often
quite
tall
usually
built
of
boards
and
supported
on
solid
frames
resting
on
a
foundation
of
stone
in
the
country
such
fences
are
hardly
more
than
trellises
of
bamboo
and
these
of
the
lightest
description
many
of
the
fences
are
strictly
ornamental
consisting
either
of
light
trellises
bounding
certain
areas
or
forming
little
screens
jutting
from
the
side
of
the
house
or
from
the
side
of
more
durable
fences
or
walls
of
these
the
designs
are

let
us
examine
more
in

some
of
the
principal
japanese
types
of
fences
a
simple
consists
as
with
us
of
an
upper
and
lower
to
which
the
boards
are
nailed
a
useful
modification
of
the
ordinary
consists
in
having
the
upper
and
lower
rails
of
thick
board
three
or
four
inches
wide
and
nailed
sideways
to
the
the
are
nailed
to
these
rails
alternately
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
a
pretty
effect
is
produced
by
the
interrupted
appearance
of
the
rails
and
a
useful
purpose
also
is
subserved
by
lessening
the
pressure
of
the
wind
which
so
often
blows
with
great
violence
since
by
securing
the
boards
in
this
way
interspaces
occur
between
the
boards
the
width
of
the
rails
illustrates
a
portion
of
this
kind
of
fence
with
its
appearance
in
section
as
seen
from

feature

fences
might
be
imitated
with
advantage

fences
are
made
by
mortising
each
stake
which
consists
of
a
stout
square
piece
and
running
the
rail
through
the
mortises
thus
made
and
then
pinning
each
stake
in
position
in
many
fences
of
this
kind
there
are
two
rails
near
together
while
the
lower
ends
of
the
stakes
are
secured
to
a
or
sill
which
is
raised
an
inch
or
two
from
the
ground
by
stone
props
at
intervals
by
this
treatment
the
sill
is
preserved
both
from
the
ravages
of
insects
and
the
dampness
of
the
ground
gives
the
appearance
of
this
kind
of
fence
such
fences
are
made
more
secure
by
driving
into
the
ground
additional
posts
at
a
distance
of
two
feet
or
more
and
binding
them

a

that
the

was
curious
to
know
how
such
a
design
was
burned
in
this
formal
pattern

learned
that
a
long
stout
rope
or
band
of
straw
soaked
in
water
was
first
wound
around
the
post
in
a
wide
spiral

directions

a

hot
coals
being
prepared
the
post
was
exposed
to
this
heat

the

not
protected
by

wet
became
charred

simple
yet
ingenious
way
of
getting

garden

house
presents
features
that
never
enter
into
similar
places
in
america
with
us
it
is
either
modelled
after
certain
french
styles
or
it
is
simply
beds
of
flowers
in
patches
or
formal
plats
or
narrow
beds
bordering
the
paths
and
even
these
attempts
are
generally
made
on
large
areas
only
the
smaller
gardens
seen
around
our
ordinary
dwellings
are
with
few
exceptions
a
tangle
of
bushes
or
wretched
attempts
to
crowd
as
many
different
kinds
of
flowers
as
possible
into
a
given
area
and
when
winter
comes
there
is
nothing
left
but
a
harvest
of
dead
stalks
and
a
lot
of
trellises
painted
green
it
is
no
wonder
then
that
as
our
people
have
gradually
become
awakened
within
recent
years
to
some
idea
of
fitness
and
harmony
of
color
the
conventional
has
been
hopelessly
abandoned

now
green
grass
grows
over
the
graves
of
most
of
these
futile
attempts
to
defy
nature

grass
substitute
has
at
least
the
merit
of
not
being
offensive
to
the
eye
and
of
requiring
but
little
care
save
that
of
the
strenuous
pushing
of
the
mechanical
this
substitute
is
however
a
confession
of
inability
and
ignorance
much
as
if
a
decorator
after
having
struggled
in
vain
with
his
fresco
designs
upon
some
ceiling
should
give
up
in
disgust
and
paint
the
entire
surface

color
the
secret
in
a
japanese
garden
is
that
they
do
not
attempt
too
much
that
reserve
and
sense
of
propriety
which
characterize
this
people

all
their
decorative
and
other
artistic
work
are
here

impossible

these

the
training
of
vines
and
trees
about
the
window
is
often
delightfully
conceived
we
recall
the
circular
window
of
one
that
presented
a
most
beautiful
appearance
three
sides
of
the

closed
by
permanent
plaster
partitions
tinted
a
rich

with
a
very
thatched
roof
throwing
its

on
the

in

partition
opposite

a
perfectly
circular
window

a
close
grating
of
brown
rush
over
and
around
this
being
on
the
sunny
had
been
carefully
trained
outside
a
vine
with
rich
green
leaves
so
that
the
window
was
more
or
less
shaded
by
it
the
effect
of
the
sunlight
falling
upon
the
vine
was
exquisite
beyond
description
when
two
or
three
leaves
interposed
between
the
sun
s
rays
the
color
was
a
rich
dark
green
where
here
and
there
over
the
whole
mass
a
single
leaf
only
interrupted
the
light
there
were
bright
green
flashes
like
emerald
gems
at
points
the
dazzling
sunlight
glinted
like
sparks
in
a
few
places
the
vine
and
leaves
had
been
coaxed
through
the
grating
of
rushes
and
these
were
consequently
in
deep
shadow
i
did
not
attempt
to
sketch
it
as
no
drawing
could
possibly
convey
an
idea
of
the
exceeding
richness
and
charm
of
the
effect

the
cool
and
shaded
room

the
lattice

rush
the
capacious
round
opening
and
above
all
the
effect
of
the
various
rich
greens
was
greatly
heightened
as
the
wind
tremulously
shifted
the
leafy
screens
without
and
thus
changed
the
arrangement
of
the
emerald
colors
within
my
attention
was
first
attracted
to
it
by
noticing
a
number
of
japanese
peering
at
it
through
an
open
fence
and
admiring
in
rapt
delight
this
charming
conception
such
a
room

might
easily
be
arranged

being
utilized

all

material
has
been
transported
here
by
man
from
distances
to
be
measured
by

and
that
a

a

existed
where

have
for
gardens

effects
the
smallest

being
utilized
for
this
purpose
as
an
illustration
of
this
i

an
experience
in
a
cheap
inn

i
was
forced
to
take
a
meal
or
go
hungry
till
late
at
night

immediate
surroundings

itself
being
poorly
furnished
the

hard
and
uneven
and
the
attendants
very
cheaply
dressed
in
the
room
where
our
meal
was
served
there
was
a
circular
window
through
which
could
be
seen
a
curious
stone
lantern
and
a
the
branches
of
which
stretched
across
the
opening

beyond
a
fine
view
of
some
high
mountains
was
to
be
had
from
where
we
sat
on
the
mats
there
were
all
the
evidences
of
a
fine
garden
outside
and
wondering
how
so
poor
a
house
could
sustain
so
fine
a
garden
i
went
to
the
window
to
investigate
what
was
my
surprise
to
find
that
the
extent
of
ground
from
which
the
lantern
and
sprung
was
just
three
feet
in
width
then
came
a
low
fence
and
beyond
this
stretched
the
of
a
neighboring
farmer
at
home
such
a
narrow
strip
of
land
would
in
all
likelihood
have
been
the
receptacle
for
broken
glass
and
tin
cans
and
a
thoroughfare
for
erratic
cats
here
however
everything
was
clean

neat
this
narrow

for
no
other
purpose

been
utilized

the
benefit
of

has
been
made
to
the
ponds
and
brooks
as
desirable
features
in
where
water
is
not
obtainable
for
the

or
possibly
for
the
ingenuity
of
the
idea
the
japanese
sometimes
make
a
deceptive
pond
which
is
absolutely
destitute
of
water
so
perfectly
however
are
the
various
features
of
the
pond
carried
out
that
the
effect
of

is

will

love
of
flowers
is
a
national
trait
of
the
japanese
it
would
be
safe
to
say
that
in
no
other
part
of
the
world
is
the
love
of
flowers
so
universally
shown
as
in

one
of
the
most
common
themes
and

decorative
art
in
all
its
branches

are
selected

the
leading

charming

objects
are

fairs

arrangement
of
flowers
forms
a
part
of
the
polite
education
of
the
japanese
and
special
rules
and
methods
for
their
appropriate
display
have
their
schools
and
teachers
within
the
house
there
are
special
places
where
it
is
proper
to
display
flowers
in
the
as
we
have
said
is
generally
a
vase
of
bronze
or
pottery
in
which
flowers
are
placed
the
heterogeneous
mass
of
color
comprised
in
a
jumble
of
flowers
as
is
too
often
the
case
with
us
but
a
few
flowers
of
one
kind
or
a
big
branch
of
cherry
or
plum
blossoms
are
quite
enough
to
satisfy
the
refined
tastes
of
these
people
here
as
in
other
matters
the
japanese
show
their
sense
of
propriety
and
infinite
refinement
they
most
thoroughly
abominate
our
slovenly
methods
whereby
a
clump
of
flowers
of
heterogeneous
colors
are
packed
and
jammed
together
with
no
room
for
green
leaves
this
we
call
a
bouquet
and
very
properly
since
it
resembles
a
ball
variegated
worsted
ball
these
people
believe
in
the
healthy
contrast
of
rough
brown
stem
and
green
leaves
to
show
off
by
texture
and
color
the
matchless
of
the
delicate
petals
we
however
in
our
stupidity
are
too
often
accustomed
to
tear
off
the
flowers
that
nature
has
so
deftly
arranged
on
their
own
wood
stems
and
then
with
thread
and
bristling
wire
to
fabricate
a
feeble
resemblance
to
the
milliner
s
honest
counterfeit
of
cloth
and
paper
and
by
such
treatment
at
the
end
of
a
few
hours
we
have
a
mass
equally
lifeless
in
their
too
they
show
the
most
perfect
knowledge
of
contrasts
to
any
one
of
taste
it
is
unnecessary
to
show
how
inappropriate
our
gilt
and
often
brilliantly
colored
are
for
the
objects
they
are
to
hold
by
employing
such
receptacles
all
effects
of

and
pleasing
contrasts
are
effectually

always
recognized
the
importance
of
observing

contrasts
between

few
years
have
been
forced
for

of
better
receptacles
to
arrange
flowers
in
german

these
vessels
were
certainly
inappropriate
enough

looked
vastly
prettier
in

they
ever
could

the
frightful

now

have
never
chanced
to
see
one
in
use
in
the
chapter
on

various
forms
of
vases
are
shown
in
the
my
interest
in
japanese
homes
was
first
aroused
by
wishing
to
know
precisely
what
use
the
japanese
made
of
a
class
of
objects
with
which
i
had
been
familiar
in
the
art
museums
and
private
collections
at
home
furthermore
a
study
of
their
houses
led
me
to
search
for
those
evidences
of
household
decoration
which
might
possibly
parallel
the
hanging
baskets
corner
brackets
and
especially
ornaments
made
of
birch
bark
fungi
moss
and
the
like
with
which
our
humbler
homes
are
often
garnished
it
was
delightful
to
find
that
the
japanese
were
susceptible
to
the
charms
embodied
in
these
bits
of
nature
and
that
they
too
used
them
in
similar
decorative
ways
at
the
outset
search
for
an
object
aside
from
the
bare
rooms
seemed
fruitless
enough
at
first
sight
these
rooms
appeared
absolutely
barren
in
passing
from
one
room
to
another
one
got
the
idea
that
the
house
was
to
be
let
picture
to
yourself
a
room
with
no
and
accompanying
mantel
shelf
of
shelves
for
the
support
of
pretty
objects
no
windows
with
their
convenient
interspaces
for
the
suspension
of
pictures
or
brackets
no
table
rarely
even
cabinets
to
hold
bindings
and
curious
no
upon
which
to
array
the
rich
pottery
or
glistening
porcelain
no
chairs
desks
or
bedsteads
and
consequently
no
opportunity
for
the
display
of
elaborate
carvings
or
rich
cloth
coverings
indeed
one
might
well
wonder
in
what
way
this
people
displayed
their
pretty
objects
for
household
decorations
after
studying
the
japanese
home
for
a
while
however
one
comes
to
realize
that
display
as
such
is
out
of
the
question
with
them
and
to
recognize
that
a
severe
simplicity
is
really
one
of
the
great
charms
of
a
japanese
room
absolute
cleanliness
and
refinement
with
very
few
objects
in
sight
upon
which
the
eye
may
rest
contentedly
are
the
main
features
in
household
adornment
which
the
japanese
strive
after
and
which
they
attain
with
a
simplicity
and
effectiveness
that
we
can
never
hope
to
reach
our
rooms
seem
to
them
like
a
curiosity
shop
and
stuffy
to
the
last
degree
such
a
maze
of
vases
pictures
plaques
bronzes
with
shelves
brackets
cabinets
and
tables
loaded
down
with
is
quite
enough
to
drive
a
japanese
frantic
we
parade
in
the
most
unreasoning
manner
every
object
of
this
nature
in
our
possession
and
with
the
periodical
recurrence
of
birthday
and
christmas
holidays
and
the
consequent
influx
of
new
things
the
less
pretty
ones
already
on
parade
are
banished
to
the
chambers
above
to
make
room
for
the
new
ones
and
as
these
in
turn
get
crowded
out
they
rise
to
the
garret
there
to
be
providentially
broken
up
by
the
children
or
to
be
preserved
for
future
antiquarians
to
contemplate
and
to
ponder
over
the
condition
of
art
in
this
age
our
walls
are
hung
with
large
which
were
intended
to
hold
food
heavy
bronzes
which
in
a
japanese
room
are
made
to
rest
solidly
on
the
floor
and
to
hold
great
woody
branches
of
the
plum
or
cherry
with
their
wealth
of
blossoms
are
with
us
often
placed
on
high
shelves
or
perched
in
some
perilous
position
over
the
door
the
ignorant
display
is
more
rarely
seen
of
thrusting
a
piece
of
statuary
into
the
window
so
that
the
neighbor
across
the
way
may
see
it
when
a
silhouette
cut
out
of
stiff
pasteboard
would
in
this
position
answer
all
the
purposes
so
far
as
the
inmates
are
concerned
how
often
we
destroy
an
artist
s
best
efforts
by
exposing
his
picture
against
some
glaring
fresco
or
distracting
and
still
not
content
with
the
accumulated
misery
of
such
a
room
we
allow
the
upholsterer
and
furnisher
to
provide
us
with
a
gorgeously
framed
mirror
from
which
we
may
have
flashed
back
at
us
the
contents
of
the
room
reversed
or
more
dreadful
still
a
reverberation
of
these
horrors
through
opposite
reflecting
surfaces
futile
effort
of
nature
to
sicken
us
of
the
whole
thing
by
endless
repetition
that
we
in
america
are
not
exceptional
in
these
matters
of
questionable
furnishing
one
may
learn
by
listening
to
an
english
authority
on
this
subject
who
has
done
more
than
any
other
writer
in
calling
attention
not
only
to
violations
of
true
taste
in
household
adornment
but
who
points
out
in
a
most
rational
way
the
correct
paths
to
follow
not
only
to
avoid
that
which
is
offensive
and
pretentious
but
to
arrive
at
better
methods
and
truer
principles
in
matters
of
taste
we
refer
to
charles
eastlake
and
his
timely
work
entitled
hints
on
household
in
his
animadversions
on
the
commonplace
taste
shown
in
the
furnishing
of
english
houses
he
says
it
pervades
and
vitiates
the
judgment
by
which
we
are
accustomed
to
select
and
approve
the
objects
of
use
which
we
see
around
us
it
crosses
our
path
in
the
brussels
carpet
of
our
it
is
about
our
bed
in
the
shape
of
gaudy
chintz
it
compels
us
to
rest
on
chairs
and
to
sit
at
tables
which
are
designed
in
accordance
with
the
worst
principles
of
construction
and
invested
with
shapes
confessedly
unpicturesque
it
sends
us
from
birmingham
which
is
as
vulgar
in
form
as
it
is
flimsy
in
execution
it
decorates
the
finest
modern
porcelain
with
the
most
objectionable
character
of
ornament
it
lines
our
walls
with
silly
representations
of
vegetable
life
or
with
a
mass
of
uninteresting
diaper
it
bids
us
in
short
furnish
our
houses
after
the
same
fashion
as
we
dress
ourselves
that
is
with
no
more
sense
of
real
beauty
than
if
art
were
a
dead
let
us
contrast
our
tastes
in
these
matters
with
those
of
the
japanese
and
perhaps
profit
by
the
lesson
in
the
previous
chapters
sufficient
details
have
been
given
for
one
to
grasp
the
structural
features
of
a
japanese
room
let
us
now
observe
that
the
general
tone
and
color
of
a
japanese
apartment
are
subdued
its
atmosphere
is
restful
and
only
after
one
has
sat
on
the
mats
for
some
time
do
the
unostentatious
fittings
of
the
apartment
attract
one
s
notice
the
papers
of
the
of
neutral
tints
the
plastered
surfaces
when
they
occur
equally
tinted
in
similar
tones
warm
browns
and
predominating
the
ceiling
with
the
rich
color
of
that
wood
the
everywhere
modestly
conspicuous
and
always
presenting
the
natural
colors
undefiled
by
the
painter
s
miseries
all
combine
to
render
the
room
quiet
and
refined
to
the
last
degree
the
floor
in
bright
contrast
is
covered
with
its
cool
straw
matting
uniform
bright
surface
set
off
by
the
rectangular
black
borders
of
the
mats
it
is
such
an
infinite
comfort
to
find
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
that
empire
the
floors
covered
with
the
unobtrusive
straw
matting
monotonous
some
would
think
yes
it
has
the
monotony
of
fresh
air
and
of
pure
water
such
a
room
requires
but
little
adornment
in
the
shape
of
extraneous
objects
indeed
there
are
but
few
places
where
such
objects
can
be
placed
but
observe
that
while
in
our
rooms
one
is
at
liberty
to
cover
his
wall
with
pictures
without
the
slightest
regard
to
light
or
effect
the
japanese
room
has
a
recess
clean
and
free
from
the
floor
to
the
hooded
partition
that
spans
it
above
and
this
recess
is
placed
at
right
angles
to
the
source
of
light
furthermor
it
is
exalted
as
the
place
of
highest
honor
in
the
here
and
here
alone
hangs
the
picture
not
a
varnished
affair
to
see
which
one
has
to
perambulate
the
apartment
with
head
awry
to
get
a
vantage
point
of
vision
but
a
picture
which
may
be
seen
in
its
proper
light
from
any
point
of
the
room
in
the
there
is
usually
but
one

exposed
as
we
have

or
more

to
the
height
of

may
sometimes
be
seen
a
long
narrow

framed
in
a

secured
to
a

of
the
frame
may
not
be

is
customary
to
interpose

a

is
often
substituted
for
the
iron

shown
in
the
sketch
the
picture
may
be
a
landscape
or
a
spray
of
flowers
but
more
often
it
consists
of
a
few
chinese
characters
embodying
some
bit
of
poetry
moral

sentiment
usually
the
characters
have
been

by

distinguished
man

in

of

might

our
artists
to
know
what

to
select
for
a

on
so
awkward
and
limited
surface
it
offers
no
trouble
to
the
japanese
decorator
he
simply
takes
a

of
some
good
subject

might
get

open

find
their

to

rolled
up
stowed
away
in
its
silk
covering
and
box
and
another
one
is
unrolled
in
this
way
a
picture
never
becomes
monotonous
the
listless
and
indifferent
way
in
which
an
american
will
often
regard
his
own
pictures
when
showing
them
to
a
friend
indicates
that
his
pictures
have
been
so
long
on
his
walls
that
they
no
longer
arouse
any
attention
or
delight
it
is
true
one
never
wearies
in
contemplating
the
work
of
the
great
masters
but
one
should
remember
that
all
pictures
are
not
masterpieces
and
that
by
constant
exposure
the
effect
of
a
picture
becomes
seriously
impaired
the
way
in
which
pictures
with
us
are
crowded
on
the
walls
of
them
of
necessity
in
the
worst
possible
light
or
no
light
at
all
when
the
windows
are
muffled
with
heavy
curtains
that
the
main
interest
centres
in
their
embossed
gilt
frames
which
are
conspicuous
in
all
lights
the
principle
of
constant
exposure
is
certainly
wrong
a
good
picture
is
all
the
more
enjoyable
if
it
is
not
forever
staring
one
in
the
face
who
wants
to
contemplate
a
burning
tropical
sunset
on
a
full
stomach
or
a
drizzling
northern
mist
on
an
empty
one
and
yet
these
are
the
experiences
which
we
are
often
compelled
to
endure
why
not
modify
our
rooms
and
have
a
bay
or
recess
alcove
in
the
best
possible
light
which
one
or
two
good
pictures
may
be
properly
hung
with
fitting
accompaniments
in
the
way
of
a
few
flowers
or
a
bit
of
pottery
or
bronze
we
have
never
modified
the
interior
arrangement
of
our
house
in
the
slightest
degree
from
the
time
when
it
was
shaped
in
the
most
economical
way
as
a
shelter
in
which
to
eat
sleep
and
die
rectangular
kennel
with
necessary
holes
for
light
and
necessary
holes
to
get
in
and
out
by
at
the
same
time
its
inmates
were
saturated
with
a
religion
so
austere
and
sombre
that
the
possession
of
a
picture
was
for
a
long
time
looked
upon
as
savoring
of
worldliness
and
vanity
unless
indeed
the
subject
suggested
the
other
world
by
a
vision
of
hexapodous
angels
or
of
the
transient
to
that
world
in
the
guise
of
a
tombstone
and
willows
or
an
immediate
departure
thereto
in
the
shape
of
a
scene
among
the
japanese
all
collections
of
pottery
and
other
are
in
the
same
way
as
the
pictures
carefully
enclosed
in
brocade
bags
and
boxes
and
stowed
away
to
be
unpacked
only
when
appreciative
friends
come
to
the
house
and
then
the
host
enjoys
them
with
equal
delight
aside
from
the
heightened
enjoyment
sure
to
be
evoked
by
the
japanese
method
one
is
spared
an
infinite
amount
of
chagrin
and
misery
in
having
an
unsophisticated
friend
become
enthusiastic
over
the
wrong
thing
or
mistake
a
rare
etching
of
dante
for
a
north
american
savage
or
manifest
a
thrill
of
delight
over
an
object
because
he
learns
incidentally
that
its
value
corresponds
with
his
yearly
grocery
bill
nothing
is
more
striking
in
a
japanese
room
than
the
harmonies
and
contrasts
between
the
colors
of
the
various
objects
and
the
room
itself
between
the
picture
and
the
brocades
with
which
it
is
mounted
and
the
quiet
and
subdued
color
of
the
in
which
it
is
hung
there
is
always
the
most
refined
harmony
and
such
a
background
for
the
delicious
and
healthy
contrasts
of
color
when
a
spray
of
bright
cherry
blossoms
enlivens
the
quiet
tones
of
this
honored
place
the
general
tone
of
the
room
sets
off
to
perfection
the
simplest
spray
of
flowers
a
quiet
picture
a
rough
bit
of
pottery
or
an
old
bronze
and
at
the
same
time
a
costly
and
magnificent
piece
of
gold
lacquer
blazes
out
like
a
gem
from
these
simple
surroundings
yet
the
harmony
is
not
disturbed
it
is
an
interesting
fact
that
the
efforts
at
harmonious
and
decorative
effects
which
have
been
made
by
famous
artists
and
decorators
in
this
country
and
in
england
have
been
strongly
imbued
by
the
japanese
spirit
and
every
success
attained
is
a
confirmation
of
the
correctness
of
japanese
taste

now
more
quiet
and
unobtrusive
the
merit
of
simplicity
and
reserve
where
it
belongs
and
a
fitness
everywhere
are
becoming
more
widely
recognized

is
rare
to
see
cabinets

conveniences

the
display

great
collectors

many
other
groups

objects

are
rarely

this
description
of

homes

their

i
have
to
regret
that
neither
time
strength
nor
opportunity
enabled
me
to
make
it
more
complete
by
a
description
accompanied
by
sketches
of
the
residences
of
the
highest
classes
in
japan
indeed
it
is
a
question
whether
any
of
the
old
residences
of
the
daimios
remain
in
the
condition
in
which
they
were
twenty
years
ago
or
before
the
revolution
even
where
the
buildings
remain
as
in
the
castles
of
nagoya
and
kumamoto
busy
clerks
and
secretaries
are
seen
sitting
in
chairs
and
writing
at
tables
in
foreign
style
and
though
in
some
cases
the
beautifully
decorated
with
the
elaborately
carved
and
rich
are
still
preserved
in
the
castle
of
nagoya
as
well
as
in
many
others
doubtless
introduction
of
varnished
furniture
and
foreign
carpets
in
some
of
the
apartments
has
brought
sad
discord
into
the
former
harmonies
of
the
place
in
tokio
a
number
of
former
daimios
have
built
houses
in
foreign
style
though
these
somehow
or
other
usually
lack
the
peculiar
comforts
of
our
homes
why
a
japanese
should
build
a
house
in
foreign
style
was
somewhat
of
a
puzzle
to
me
until
i
saw
the
character
of
their
homes
and
the
manner
in
which
a
foreigner
in
some
cases
was
likely
to
behave
on
entering
a
japanese
house
if
he
did
not
walk
into
it
with
his
boots
on
he
was
sure
to
be
seen
stalking
about
in
his
stockinged
feet
bumping
his
head
at
intervals
against
the
or
burning
holes
in
the
mats
in
his
clumsy
attempts
to
pick
up
coals
from
the
with
which
to
light
his
cigar
not
being
able
to
sit
on
the
mats
properly
he
sprawls
about
in
attitudes
confessedly
as
rude
as
if
a
japanese
in
our
apartments
were
to
perch
his
legs
on
the
table
if
he
will
not
take
off
his
boots
he
possibly
finds
his
way
to
the
garden
where
he
wanders
about
indenting
the
paths
with
his
or
leaving
scars
on
the
verandah
possibly
washing
his
hands
in
the
and
generally
making
himself
the
cause
of
much
discomfort
to
the
inmates
it
was
a
happy
idea
when
those
japanese
who
from
their
prominence
in
the
affairs
of
the
country
were
compelled
to
entertain
the
foreign
barbarian
conceived
the
idea
of
erecting
a
cage
in
foreign
fashion
to
hold
temporarily
the
menageries
which
they
were
often
compelled
to
receive
seriously
however
the
inelastic
character
of
most
foreigners
and
their
inability
to
adapt
themselves
to
their
surroundings
have
rendered
the
erection
of
buildings
in
foreign
style
for
their
entertainment
not
only
a
convenience
but
an
absolute
necessity
it
must
be
admitted
that
for
the
activities
of
business
especially
the
foreign
style
of
office
and
shop
is
not
only
more
convenient
but
unquestionably
superior
the
former
daimio
of
chikuzen
was
one
of
the
first
i
believe
to
build
a
house
in
foreign
style
in
tokio
and
this
building
is
a
good
typical
example
of
an
american
house
attached
however
to
this
house
is
a
wing
containing
a
number
of
rooms
in
native
style
page
shows
one
of
these
rooms
the
former
daimio
of
hizen
also
lives
in
a
foreign
house
and
there
are
many
houses
in
tokio
built
by
japanese
after
foreign
plans
in
an
earlier
portion
of
this
work
an
allusion
was
made
to
the
absence
of
those
architectural
monuments
which
are
so
characteristic
of
european
countries
the
castles
of
the
daimios
which
are
lofty
and
imposing
structures
have
already
been
referred
to
there
are
fortresses
also
of
great
extent
and
solidity
the
one
at
osaka
erected
by
hideyoshi
on
an
eminence
near
the
city
and
though
the
wooden
structures
formerly
surmounting
the
walls
were
destroyed
by
iyeyasŭ
in
the
stone
battlements
as
they
stand
must
be
considered
as
among
the
marvels
of
engineering
skill
and
the
colossal
masses
of
rock
seem
all
the
more
colossal
after
one
has
become
familiar
with
the
tiny
and
perishable
dwellings
of
the
country
in
the
walls
of
this
fortress
are
single
blocks
of
great
heights
too
above
the
surrounding
level
of
the
in
some
cases
from
thirty
to
feet
in
length
and
at
least
fifteen
feet
in
height
these
huge
blocks
have
been
transported
long
distances
from
the
mountains
many
miles
away
from
the
city
attention
is
called
to
the
existence
of
these
remarkable
monuments
as
an
evidence
that
the
japanese
are
quite
competent
to
erect
such
buildings
if
the
national
taste
had
inclined
them
in
that
way
so
far
as
i
know
a
national
impulse
has
never
led
the
japanese
to
commemorate
great
deeds
in
the
nation
s
life
by
enduring
monuments
of
stone
the
reason
may
be
that
the
plucky
little
nation
has
always
been
successful
in
repelling
invasion
and
a
peculiar
quality
in
their
temperament
has
prevented
them
from
perpetuating
in
a
public
way
either
by
monuments
or
by
the
naming
of
streets
and
bridges
the
memories
of
victories
won
by
one
section
of
the
country
over
another
rev
griffis

an
interesting
article
on
the
streets
and
names

yedo

noticing
the
almost
total
absence
of
the
names
of
great
victories
or
historic
battlefields
in
the
naming
of
the
streets
and
bridges
in
tokio
says
it
would
have
been
an
unwise
policy
in
the
great
unifier
of
japan
iyeyasŭ
to
have
given
to
the
streets
in
the
capital
of
a
nation
finally
united

peaceful
union
any
name
that
would
be
a
constant
source
of
humiliation
that
would
keep
alive
bitter
memories
or

would
irritate
wounds
the
anomalous
absence
of
such
names
proves
at
once
the
sagacity
of

a
glimpse
of
the
japanese
house
as
it
was
a
thousand
years
or
more
ago
satow
claims
that
the
ancient
japanese
rituals
are
the
oldest
specimens
of
ancient
indigenous
japanese
literature
extant
excepting
only
perhaps
the
poetry
contained
in
the
kojiki
and
nihongi
and
chamberlain
says
the
kojiki
is
the
earliest
authentic
connected
literary
product
of
that
large
division
of
the
human
race
which
has
been
variously
denominated
turanian
scythian
and
altaïc
and
it
if
even
precedes
by
at
least
a
century
the
most
ancient
extant
literary
compositions
of
the
allusions
to
in
the
kojiki
though
brief
are
suggestive
and
carry
us
back
without
question
to
the
condition
of
the
japanese
house
in
the
seventh
and
eighth
centuries
satow
in
his
translation
of
the
rituals
says
that
the
period
when
this
service
was
first
instituted
was
certainly
before
the
tenth
century
and
probably
earlier
from
these
records
he
ascertains
that
the
palace
of
the
japanese
sovereign
was
a
wooden
hut
with
its
pillars
planted
in
the
ground
instead
of
being
erected
upon
broad
flat
stones
as
in
modern
buildings
the
whole
consisting
of
posts
beams
rafters
and
was
tied
together
with
cords
made
by
twisting
the
long
fibrous
stems
of
climbing
plants
as
pueraria
thunbergiana
kuzu
and
wistaria
sinensis
fuji
the
floor
must
have
been
low
down
so
that
the
occupants
of
the
building
as
they
squatted
or
lay
on
their
mats
were
exposed
to
the
stealthy
attacks
of
venomous
snakes
which
were
probably
far
more
numerous
in
the
earliest
ages
when
the
country
was
for
the
most
part
uncultivated
than
at
the
present
seems
some
reason
to
think
that
the
here
translated
floor
was
originally
nothing
but
a
couch
which
ran
around
the
sides
of
the
hut
the
rest
of
the
space
being
simply
a
and
that
the
size
of
the
couch
was
gradually
increased
until
it
occupied
the
whole
interior
the
rafters
projected
upward
beyond
the
crossing
each
other
as
is
seen
in
the
roofs
of
modern
temples
whether
their
architecture
be
in
conformity
with
early
traditions
in
which
case
all
the
rafters
are
so
crossed
or
modified
in
accordance
with
more
advanced
principles
of
construction
and
the
crossed
rafters
retained
only
as
ornaments
at
the
two
ends
of
the
ridge
the
roof
was
thatched
and
perhaps
had
a
gable
at
each
end
with
a
hole
to
allow
the
smoke
of
the
to
escape
that
it
was
possible
for
birds
flying
in
and
perching
on
the
beams
overhead
to
defile
the
food
or
the
fire
with
which
it
was
from
the
kojiki
we
learn
that
even
in
those
early
days
the
house
was
sufficiently
differentiated
to
present
forms
referred
to
as
temples
or
palaces
houses
of
the
people
storehouses
and
rude
huts
that
the
temples

were
more
than
rude
huts
is
shown
by
references
to
the
verandah
the
great
roof
stout
pillars
and
high
they
were
at
least
two
stories
high
as
we
read
of
people
gazing
from
an
upper
story
the
peasants
were
not
allowed
to
build

a
raised

a
roof
the
upper
portion
or
ridge
of
which
was
raised
above
the

and
having
a
different

this
indicates
the
existence
at
that
time
of
different
kinds
of
roofs
or
ridges

were
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
the

in
the
japanese
country

of

were
buried
deep
in
the
ground
and
not
as
in
the
present
house
resting
on
a
stone
foundation
the
allusions
in
the
kojiki
where
it
says
and
if
thou
goest
in
a

along
that
road
there
will
appear
a

again
the

were
shattered

the
existence
of

at
that
time
a
curious
reference
is
also
made
to
using
cormorants
feathers
for
thatch
there
were
front
doors
and
back
doors
doors
to
be
raised
and
windows
and

it
is
mentioned
that
through
the
awkwardness
of
the
carpenter
the
farther
fin
of
the
great
roof
is
bent
down
at
the
corner
indicating
wide
eaves
the
corners
of
which
might
easily
be
called
within

house
were
mats
of
sedge

silk
and
ornamental

the

the

had
back

other

some
of
these
gates
at
least
had
a
structure
above

we
read
in

kojiki
come
under
the
metal
gate
we
will
stand

the

fences
are
also
alluded
to
the
latrine
is
mentioned
several
times
as
being
away
from
the
house
and
having
been
placed
over
running
water
whence
doubtless
the
name
that
is
this
feature
is
specially
characteristic
of
the
latrine
from
siam
to
java
this
suggestion
of
early
finities
with
the
malay
people
is
seen
in
an
ancient
japanese
classic
dating
from
the
tenth
century
entitled
or
tales
of
japan
translated
by
chamberlain
in
which
we
read
now
in
olden
days
the
people
dwelt
in
houses
raised
on
platforms
built
out
in
the
river
in
the
kojiki
we
also
read
they
made
in
the
middle
of
the
river
hi
a
black
plaited
bridge
and
respectfully
offered
a
temporary
palace
to
dwell
the
translator
says
the
significance
of
this
passage
is
they
built
as
a
temporary
abode
for
the
prince
a
house
in
the
river
hi
whether
with
its
foundations
actually
in
the
water
or
on
an
island
is
left
undetermined
connecting
it
with
the

a
bridge
made
of
branches
of
trees
twisted
together
and
with
their
bark
left
on
them
this
is
here
the
import
of
the
word
the
kojiki
mentions
a
boat

this
be
some
kind
of
a
catamaran

is
also
made

point
of

though
not
the
most
ancient
has
some
interesting
matter
concerning
the
character
of
the
ancient
house
he
says
japanese
antiquarians
tell
us
that
in
early
times
before
carpenters
tools
had
been
invented
the
dwellings
of
the
people
who
inhabited
these
islands
were
constructed
of
young
trees
with
the
bark
on
fastened
together
with
ropes
made
of
the
rush
suge
maritimus
or
perhaps
with
the
tough
shoots
of
the
wistaria
fuji
and
thatched
with
the
grass
called
in
modern
buildings
the
uprights
of
a
house
stand
upon
large
stones
laid
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
but
this
precaution
against
decay
had
not
occurred
to
the
ancients
who
planted
the
uprights
in
holes
dug
in
the
the
of
the
hut
was
oblong
with
four
corner
uprights
and
one
in
the
middle
of
each
of
the
four
sides
in
the
sides
which
formed
the
ends
being
long
enough
to
support
the
other
trees
were
fastened
horizontally
from
corner
to
corner
set
near
the
ground
one
near
the
top
and
one
set
on
the

the
latter
of
which
formed
what
we
call
the
two
large
rafters
whose
upper
ends
crossed
each
other
were
laid
from
the

the
heads
of
the
taller
uprights
the
rested
in
the
fork
formed
by
the
upper
ends
of
the
rafters
crossing
each
other
horizontal
poles
were
then
laid
along
each
slope
of
the
roof
one
pair
being
fastened
close
up
to
the
exterior
angle
of
the
fork
the
rafters
were
slender
poles
or
bamboos
passed
over
the
pole

fastened
down
on

end

in

keep
this
in

place
two
trees
were
laid
along
the

in
the

two
trees
were
placed
short
logs
at
equal
distances

passed

bound
the
ridge
of
the
roof
firmly
together
the
walls
and
doors
were
constructed
of
rough
matting
it
is
evident
that
some
tool
must
have
been
used
to
cut
the
trees
to
the
required
length
and
for
this
purpose
a
sharpened
stone
was
probably
employed
such
stone
implements
have
been
found
imbedded
in
the

in
various
parts
of
japan
in
company
with
stone
and
clubs

of
the
ancient
style
of
building
may
even

be
seen

remote

so
much
in

of

in
the
proper
position
projecting
from
the
inside
of
the
shingling
but
in
the
majority
of
cases
they
merely
consist
of
two
pieces
of

in
the

folding
doors
turning
not

hinges
but
on
what
are
i
believe
technically
called
the
primeval
hut
had
no
flooring
but
we
find
that
the
shrine
has
a
wooden
floor
raised
some
feet
above
the
ground
which
arrangement
necessitates
a
sort
of
balcony
all
round
and
a
flight
of
steps
up
to
the
entrance
the
transformation
is
completed
in
some
cases
by
the
addition
of
a
quantity
of
ornamental
in
coming
down
to
somewhat
later
times
we
find
a
charming
bit
of
description
of
the
house
in
an
ancient
japanese
classic
entitled
nikki
or
tosa
diary
translated
by
aston
this
diary
was
written
in
the
middle
of
the
tenth
century
and
is
the
record
of
a
court
noble
who
lived
in
kioto
but
who
was
absent
from
his
home
five
or
six
years
as
prefect
of
tosa
the
diary
was
a
record
of
his
journey
home
and
the
first
entry
in
it
was
in
the
fourth
year
of
shohei
which
according
to
our
reckoning
must
have
been
in
the
early
part
of
or
nearly
one
thousand
years
ago
during
his
absence
from
home
news
had
come
to
him
of
the
death
of
his
little
daughter
nine
years
old
and
he
says
with
the
joyful
thought
home
to
kioto
there
mingles
the
bitter
reflection
that
there
is
one
who
never
will
the
journey
home
was
mostly
by
sea
and
finally
having
entered
the
osaka
river
and
spent
several
days
in
struggling
against
the
strong
current
he
reaches
yamazaki
from
which
place
he
starts
for
kioto
he
expresses
great
delight
in
recognizing
the
old
familiar
landmarks
as
he
rides
along
he
mentions
the
children
s
playthings
and
sweetmeats
in
the
shops
as
looking
exactly
as
when
he
went
away
and
wonders
whether
he
will
find
as
little
change
in
the
hearts
of
his
friends
he
had
purposely
left
yamazaki
in
the
evening
in
order
that
it
might
be
night
when
he
reached
his
own
aston
translates
his
account
of
the
state
in
which
he
found
it
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
when
i
reached
my
house
and
entered
the
gate
so
that
its
condition
was
plainly
to
be
seen
it
was
decayed
and
ruined
beyond
all
description
even
than
i
had
been
told
the
house
of
the
man
in
whose
charge
i
left
it
was
in
an
equally
dilapidated
condition
the
fence
between
the
two
houses
had
been
broken
down
so
that
both
seemed
but
one
and
he
appeared
to
have
fulfilled
his
charge
by
looking
in
through
the
gaps
and
yet
i
had
supplied
him
by
every
opportunity
with
the
means
of
keeping
it
in
repair
however
i
would
not
allow
him
to
be
told
this
in
an
angry
tone
but
in
spite
of
my
vexation
offered
him
an
acknowledgment
for
his
trouble
there
was
in
one
place
something
like
a
pond
where
water
had
collected
in
a
hollow
by
the
side
of
which
grew
a
it
had
lost
half
its
branches
and
looked
as
if
a
thousand
years
had
passed
during
the
five
or
six
years
of
my
absence
younger
trees
had
grown
up
round
it
and
the
whole
place
was
in
a
most
neglectful
condition
so
that
every
a
one
said
that
it
was
pitiful
to
see
among
other
sad
thoughts
that
rose
spontaneously
to
my
mind
was
the
how
sorrowful
one
who
was
born
in
this
house
but
who
did
not
return
here
along
with
me
my
passengers
were
chatting
merrily
with
their
children
in
their
arms
but
i
meanwhile
still
unable
to
contain
my
grief
privately
repeated
these
lines
to
one
who
knew
my
in
this
pathetic
account
one
gets
a
glimpse
of
the
house
as
it
appeared
nearly
a
thousand
years
ago
the
broken
fence
between
the
houses
the
gateway
probably
a
conspicuous
structure
then
as
it
is
in
a
dilapidated
condition
and
the
neglected
garden
with
a
tangle
of
young
trees
growing
up
show
the
existence
in
those
early
days
of
features
similar
to
those
which
exist
the
history
of
house
development
in
japan
if
it
should
ever
be
revealed
will
probably
show
a
slow
but
steady
progress
from
the
rude
hut
of
the
past
to
the
curious
and
artistic
house
of
house
as
thoroughly
a
product
of
japan
as
is
that
of
the
chinese
korean
or
malay
a
product
of
those
respective
peoples
and
differing
from
all
quite
as
much
as
they
differ
from
one
another
a
few
features
have
been
introduced
from
abroad
but
these
have
been
trifling
as
compared
to
the
wholesale
imitation
of
foreign
styles
of
architecture
by
our
ancestors
the
english
and
until
within
a
few
years
we
have
followed
england
s
example
in
perpetuating
the
legacy
it
left
us
in
the
shape
of
badly
imitated
foreign
architecture
classical
and
otherwise
as
a
result
we
have
scattered
over
the
land
among
a
few
public
buildings
of
good
taste
a
countless
number
of
proportioned
ugly
and
entirely
inappropriate
buildings
for
public
use
had
the
exuberant
fancies
of
the
village
architect
revelled
in
woodsheds
or
buildings
the
harm
would
have
been
trifling
but
the
desire
for
pretentious
show
which
seems
to
characterize
the
average
american
has
led
to
the
erection
of
these
architectural
horrors
on
the
most
conspicuous
sites
thus
the
public
taste
is
vitiated
the
japanese
while
developing
an
original
type
of
house
have
adopted
the
serviceable
tile
from
korea
and
probably
also
the
economical
transverse
framing
and
vertical
struts
from
china
and
bits
of
temple
architecture
for
external
adornments
as
to
their
temple
architecture
which
came
in
with
one
of
their
religions
they
had
the
good
sense
to
leave
it
comparatively
as
it
was
brought
to
them
indeed
the
temples
seem
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
country
and
its
people
what
shall
we
say
however
to
the
taste
displayed
by
the
english
who
in
the
most
servile
manner
have
copied
foreign
styles
of
architecture
utterly
unsuited
to
their
climate
and
people
in
the
space
of
an
english
block
one
may
see
not
only
grecian
roman
italian
and
egyptian
as
well
as
other
styles
of
architecture
but
audaciously
attempted
crosses
between
some
of
these
and
the
resulting
hybrids
have
in
consequence
rendered
the
modern
english
town
the
most
unpicturesque
muddle
of
buildings
in
christendom
outside
our
own
country
chapter
ix
the
neighboring
house
having
got
a
glimpse
and
a
slight
glimpse
only
of
the
ancient
house
in
japan
it
may
be
of
interest
to
consider
briefly
the
character
of
the
house
in
neighboring
islands
forming
part
of
the
japanese
empire
and
also
of
the
house
in
that
country
which
comes
nearest
to
japan
korea
and
from
which
country
in
the
past
there
have
been
many
both
peaceful
and
compulsory
invasions
in
the
fact
that
when
hideyoshi
returned
from
korea
nearly
three
hundred
years
ago
after
his
great
invasion
of
that
country
he
brought
back
with
him
to
japan
colonies
of
potters
and
other
artisans
the
ainos
of
yezo
naturally
claim
our
attention
first
because
it
is
believed
that
they
were
the
aboriginal
people
of
japan
proper
and
were
afterwards
displaced
by
the
japanese
displacement
similar
to
that
of
our
north
american
savages
by
the
english
colonists
whether
the
ainos
are
autochthonous
or
not
will
not
be
discussed
here
that
they
are
a
savage
race
without
written
language
race
which
formerly
occupied
the
northern
part
of
the
main
island
of
japan
and
were
gradually
forced
back
to
yezo
where
they
still
live
in
scattered
communities
facts
which
are
unquestionable
how
far
the
aino
house
represents
the
ancient
aino
house
and
how
many
features
of
the
japanese
house
are
engrafted
upon
it
are
points
difficult
to
determine
the
ainos
that
i
saw
in
the
ishikari

from
shiraoi
south
on
the
east
coast

spoke

lacquer

small
pipes
drank
and
within
their
huts
possessed
lacquer
boxes
and
other
conveniences
in
which
to
stow
away
their
clothing
which
had
probably
been
given
them
in
past
times
by
the
japanese
and
which
were
heirlooms
on
the
other
hand
they
retained
their
own
language
their
long
narrow
used
the
small
bow
the
poisoned
arrow
and
had
an
of
their
own
adhered
to
their
ancestral
forms
of
worship
and
their
peculiar
methods
of
design
and
were
quite
as
persistent
in
clinging
to
many
of
their
customs
as
are
our
own
western
tribes
of
indians
that
they
are
susceptible
to
change
is
seen
in
the
presence
of
a
young
aino
at
the

school
in

give
an
idea
of
the
appearance
of
two
aino
houses
of
the
better
kind
but
perhaps
can
not
be
taken
as
a
type
of
the
aino
house
farther
north
on
the
island
let
us
now
glance
at
the
house
of
the
natives
of
the
hachijô
islanders
as
described
by
dickins
and
mr
satow
from
their
communication
the
following
account
is
taken
as
may
readily
be
supposed
there
are
no
shops
or
inns
on
the
island
but
fair
accommodation
for
travellers
can
be
obtained
at
the
farmers
houses
these
are
for
the
most
part
cottages
of
two
or
three
rooms
with
a
spacious
kitchen
constructed
with
the
timber
of
cuspidata
and
with
plank
walls
where
on
the
mainland
it
is
usual
to
have
plastered
wattles
the
roof
is
invariably
of
thatch
with
a
very
high
pitch
we
were
told
by
the
extreme
dampness
of
the
climate
which
renders
it
desirable
to
allow
as
little
rain
as
possible
to
soak
into
the
straw
many
of
the
more
prosperous
farmers
have
a
second
building
devoted
to
the
rearing
of
silkworms
which
takes
its
name
from
the
purpose
to
which
it
is
destined
there
are
also
sheds
for
cattle
usually
consisting
of
a
thatched
roof
resting
on
walls
formed
of
rough
lastly
each
enclosure
possesses
a
wooden
godown
raised
some
four
feet
from
the
ground
on
stout
wooden
posts
crowned
with
broad
caps
to
prevent
the
mice
from
gaining
an
entrance
the
style
resembles
that
of
the
storehouses
constructed
by
the
ainos
and
the
house
and
belonging
to
it
are
usually
surrounded
by
a
stone
wall
or
rather
bank
of
stones
and
earth
often
six
feet
high
designed
to
protect
the
buildings
from
the
violent
gales
which
at
certain
seasons
sweep
over
the
island
and
which
as
we
learned
frequently
do
serious
injury
to
the
by
the
quantity
of
salt
spray
which
they
carry
a
long
distance
inland
from
the
from
this
general
description
of
the
house
which
incidentally
accompanies
a
very
interesting
sketch
of
the
physical
peculiarities
of
the
island
its
geology
botany
and
the
customs
and
dialect
of
the
people
we
get
no
idea
of
the
special
features
the
house
to
the
fireplace
or
whether
there
be
or
ordinary
windows
matted
floor
or
any
of
those
details
which
would
render
a
comparison
with
the
japanese
house
of
value
as
satow
found
in
the
language
of
the
hachijô
islander
a
number
of
words
which
appeared
to
be
survivals
of
archaic
japanese
and
also
among
their
customs
the
curious
one
which
existed
up
to
within
very
recent
times
of
erecting
parturition
houses
feature
which
is
alluded
to
in
the
very
earliest
records
of
japan
minute
description
of
the
hachijô
house
with
sketches
might
possibly
lead
to
some
facts
of
interest
the
loochoo
or
riukiu
islands
now
known
as
okinawa
shima
lie
nearly
midway
between
the
southern
part
of
japan
and
the
island
of
formosa
the
people
of
this
group
differ
but
little
from
the
japanese
language
according
to
satow
and
brunton
having
in
it
words
that
appear
obsolete
in
japan
in
many
customs
there
is
a
curious
admixture
of
chinese
and
japanese
ways
and
brunton
sees
in
the
loochooan
bridge
and
other
structures
certain
resemblances
to
chinese
methods
the
following
extract
regarding
the
house
of
the
loochooans
is
taken
from
an
account
of
a
visit
to
these
islands
by
ernest
satow
published
in
the
first
volume
of
the
transactions
of
the
asiatic
society
of
japan
the
houses
of
the
loochooans
are
built
in
japanese
fashion
with
the
floor
raised
three
or
four
feet
from
the
ground
and
have
mostly
only
one
story
on
account
of
the
violent
winds
which
prevail
they
are
roofed
with
tiles
of
a
chinese
fashion
very
strong
and
thick
the
buildings
in
which
they
store
their
rice
are
built
of
wood
and
thatched
with
straw
they
are
supported
on
wooden
posts
about
five
feet
high
and
resemble
the
granaries
of
the
ainos
though
constructed
with
much
greater
another
extract
is
here
given
in
regard
to
the
house
of
the
loochooans
by
brunton
published
in
the
transactions
of
the
asiatic
society
of
japan
the
streets
in
the
towns
present
a
most
desolate
appearance
on
each
side
of
these
is
a
blank
stone
wall
of
about
ten
or
twelve
feet
high
with
openings
in
them
here
and
there
sufficiently
wide
to
admit
of
access
to
the
houses
which
are
behind
every
house
is
surrounded
by
a
wall
and
from
the
street
they
convey
the
impression
of
being
prisons
rather
than
ordinary
the
houses
of
the
classes
are
situated
in
a
yard
which
is
surrounded
by
a
wall
ten
or
twelve
feet
high
as
has
been
already
mentioned
they
are
similar
to
the
ordinary
japanese
houses
with
raised
floors
laid
with
mats
and
sliding
screens
of
paper
they
are
built
of
wood
and
present
no
peculiar
differences
from
the
japanese
style
of
construction
the
roofs
are
laid
with
tiles
which
however
are
quite
different
in
shape
from
the
japanese
tiles
over
the
joint
between
two
concave
tiles
a
convex
one
is
laid
and
these
are
all
in
cross
sections
the
tiles
are
made
at
nafa
and
are
red
in
color
they
appeared
of
good
quality
the
houses
of
the
poorer
classes
are
of
very
primitive
character
the
roof
is
covered
with
a
thick
thatch
and
is
supported
by
four
corner
uprights
about
five
feet
high
the
walls
consist
of
sheets
of
a
species
of
netting
made
of
small
bamboo
which
contain
between
them
a
thickness
of
about
six
inches
of
straw
this
encloses
the
whole
sides
of
the
house
width
of
about
two
feet
being
left
in
one
side
as
an
entrance
there
is
no
flooring
in
the
houses
of
any
description
and
there
is
generally
laid
over
the
mud
inside
a
mat
on
which
the
inmates
lie
or
considering
the
presence
for
so
many
centuries
of
strong
chinese
influence
which
brunton
sees
in
the
loochooans
it
is
rather
surprising
to
find
so
many
features
of
the
japanese
house
present
in
their
dwellings
indeed
brunton
goes
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
loochooan
house
presents
no
peculiar
differences
from
the
japanese
style
of
construction
and
as
he
has
paid
special
attention
to
the
constructive
features
of
japanese
buildings
we
must
believe
that
had
differences
existed
they
would
have
been
noted
by
him
it
seems
to
me
that
the
wide
distribution
of
certain
identical
features
in
japanese
from
the
extreme
north
of
japan
to
the
loochoo
islands
is
something
remarkable
here
is
a
people
who
for
centuries
lived
almost
independent
provincial
lives
the
northern
and
southern
provinces
speaking
different
dialects
even
the
character
of
the
people
varying
and
yet
from
awomori
in
the
north
to
the
southernmost
parts
of
satsuma
and
even
farther
south
to
the
loochoos
the
use
of
shōji
mats
and
thin
seems
universal
the
standing
on
four
posts
are
referred
to
in
the
description
of
the
hachijô
islanders
as
well
as
in
that
of
the
loochooans
as
resembling
those
constructed
by
the
ainos
yet
these
resemblances
must
not
be
taken
as
indicating
a
community
of
origin
but
simply
as
the
result
of
necessity
for
travellers
in
kamtchatka
and
farther
west
speak
of
the
same
kind
of
and
farther
south
they
may
be
seen
in
singapore
and
java
fact
in
every
country
town
in
new
england
and
indeed
all
over
the
united
states
the
same
kind
of
storehouse
is
seen
probably
all
over
the
world
a
on
four
legs
even
to
the
inverted
box
or
pan
on
each
leg
may
be
found
through
the
courtesy
of
percival
lowell
i
am
enabled
to
see
advanced
sheets
of
his
work
on
korea
entitled
the
land
of
the
morning
calm
and
from
this
valuable
work
the
author
has
permitted
me
to
gather
many
interesting
facts
concerning
the
korean
dwellings
the
houses
are
of
one
story
a
flight
of
two
or
three
steps
leads
to
a
narrow
piazza
or
very
wide
sill
which
encircles
the
entire
building
the
apartment
within
is
only
limited
by
the
size
of
the
building
in
other
words
there
is
only
one
room
under
the
roof
the
better
class
of
dwellings
however
consist
of
groups
of
these
buildings
the
house
is
of
wood
and
rests
upon
a
stone
foundation
this
foundation
consists
of
a
series
of
connecting
chambers
or
flues
and
at
one
side
is
a
large
fireplace
or
oven
in
which
the
fire
is
built
the
products
of
combustion
circulate
through
this
labyrinth
of
chambers
and
find
egress
not
by
a
chimney
but
by
an
outlet
on
the
opposite
side
in
this
way
the
room
above
is
warmed
there
are
three
different
types
of
this
foundation
in
the
best
type
a
single
slab
of
stone
is
supported
by
a
number
of
stout
stone
pillars
upon
this
stone
floor
is
spread
a
layer
of
earth
and
upon
this
earth
is
spread
paper
like
a
carpet
in
another
arrangement
ridges
of
earth
and
small
stones
run
lengthwise
from
front
to
back
on
top
of
this
the
same
arrangement
is
made
of
stone
earth
and
in
the
third
type
representing
a
still
poorer
class
the
oven
and
flues
are
hollowed
out
of
the
earth
alone
lowell
remarks
that
the
idea
is
a
good
one
if
it
were
only
accompanied
by
proper
ventilation
unfortunately
he
says
the
room
above
is
no
better
than
a
box
in
which
the
occupant
is
slowly
roasted
another
disadvantage
is
experienced
in
the
impossibility
of
warming
a
room
at
once
he
says
the
room
does
not
even
begin
to
get
warm
until
you
have
passed
through
an
agonizing
interval
of
expectancy
then
it
takes
what
seems
forever
to
reach
a
comfortable
temperature
passes
this
brief
second
of
happiness
before
you
have
had
time
to
realize
that
it
has
attained
it
and
continues
mounting
to
unknown
degrees
in
a
truly
alarming
manner
beyond
the
possibility
of
this
curious
and
ingenious
method
of
warming
houses
is
said
to
have
been
introduced
from
china
some
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
a
house
of
the
highest
order
is
simply
a
roof
supported
on
eight
or
more
posts
according
to
the
size
of
the
building
and
this
with
a
foundation
represents
the
only
fixed
structure
in
summer
it
presents
a
appearance
in
winter
however
it
appears
solid
and
compact
as
a
series
of
pair
between
each
two
posts
it
completely
these
are
prettily
latticed
open
outward
and
are
fastened
from
within
by
a
hook
and
knob
by
a
curious
arrangement
these
doors
can
be
removed
from
their
hinges
the
upper
parts
only
remaining
attached
and
fastened
up
by
hooks
to
the
ceiling
this
kind
of
a
house
and
room
is
used
as
a
banqueting
hall
and
a
room
for
general
entertainment
it
may
be
compared
to
our
are
constructed
on
quite
a
different
plan
instead
of
continuous
doors
the
sides
are
composed
of
permanent
walls
and
doors
the
wall
is
of
wood
except
that
in
the
poorer
house
it
consists
of
mud
says
lowell
in
these
buildings
we
have
an
elaborate
system
of
aperture
closers
species
of
three
skins
only
that
they
are
for
consecutive
not
simultaneous
use
the
outer
is
the
above
mentioned
the
other
two
are
a
couple
of
pairs
of
sliding
panels
survivors
in
korea
of
the
once
common
sliding
screens
such
as
are
used
in
japan
one
of
the
pairs
is
covered
with
dark
green
paper
and
is
for
night
use
the
other
is
of
the
natural
yellowish
color
of
the
paper
and
is
used
by
day
when
not
wanted
they
slide
back
into
grooves
inside
the
wall
whence
they
are
pulled
out
again
by
ribbons
fastened
near
the
middle
of
the
outer
edge
all
screens
of
this
sort
whether
in
houses
or
palanquins
are
provided
unlike
the
japanese
with
these
conveniences
for
tying
the
two
halves
of
each
pair
together
and
thus
enabling
easier
the
within
is
paper
covers
the
ceiling
lines
the
wall
spreads
the
floor
as
you
sit
in
your
room
your
eye
falls
upon
nothing
but
paper
and
the
very
light
that
enables
you
to
see
anything
at
all
sifts
in
through
the
same
it
will
be
seen
by
these
brief
extracts
how
dissimilar
the
korean
house
is
to
that
of
the
japanese
and
this
dissimilarity
is
fully
sustained
by
an
examination
of
the
photographs
which
lowell
made
in
korea
and
which
show
among
other
things
low
houses
with
square
openings
for
windows
closed
by
frames
covered
with
paper
the
frames
hung
from
above
and
opening
outside
and
the
roof
tiled
also
curious
thatched
roofs
in
which
the
slopes
are
uneven
and
rounding
and
their
ridges
curiously
knotted
or
braided
differing
in
every
respect
from
the
many
forms
of
thatched
roof
in
japan
the
chinese
house
as
i
saw
it
in
shanghai
and
its
suburbs
and
at
canton
as
well
as
up
the
river
shows
differences
from
the
japanese
house
quite
as
striking
as
those
of
the
korean
house
here
one
sees
in
the
cities
at
least
solid
houses
with
kitchen
range
built
into
the
wall
and
chimney
equally
permanent
with
tiled
ridges
enclosed
floors
of
stone
upon
which
the
shoes
are
worn
from
the
street
doorways
with
doors
on
hinges
window
openings
closed
by
swinging
frames
fitted
with
the
translucent
shells
of
placuna
or
white
paper
the
latter
usually
in
a
dilapidated
condition
and
for
furniture
they
have
tables
chairs
bedsteads
drawers
babies
chairs
cradles
and
thel
like
the
of
china
in
those
regions
that
i
visited
were
equally
unlike
similar
houses
in
japan
from
this
superficial
glance
at
the
character
of
the
house
in
the
outlying
islands
of
the
japanese
empire
as
well
as
at
the
houses
of
the
neighboring
countries
korea
and
china
i
think
it
will
be
conceded
that
the
japanese
house
is
typically
a
product
of
the
people
with
just
those
features
from
abroad
incorporated
in
it
that
one
might
look
for
considering
the
proximity
to
japan
of
china
and
korea
when
we
remember
that
these
three
great
civilizations
of
the
mongoloid
race
approximate
within
the
radius
of
a
few
hundred
miles
and
that
they
have
been
in
more
or
less
intimate
contact
since
early
historic
times
we
can
not
wonder
that
the
germs
of
japanese
art
and
letters
should
have
been
adopted
from
the
continent
in
precisely
the
same
way
our
ancestors
the
english
drew
from
their
continent
the
material
for
their
language
art
music
architecture
and
many
other
important
factors
in
their
civilization
and
if
history
speaks
truly
their
refinement
even
in
language
and
etiquette
was
imported
but
while
japan
like
england
has
modified
and
developed
the
germs
ingrafted
from
a
greater
and
older
civilization
it
has
ever
preserved
the
elasticity
of
youth
and
seized
upon
the
good
things
of
our
civilization
as
steam
electricity
and
modern
methods
of
study
and
research
utilized
them
promptly
far
different
is
it
from
the
mother
country
where
the
improvements
and
methods
of
other
nations
get
but
tardy
recognition
it
seems
to
give
certain
english
writers
peculiar
delight
to
stigmatize
the
japanese
as
a
nation
of
imitators
and
copyists
from
the
contemptuous
manner
in
which
disparagements
of
this
nature
are
flung
into
the
faces
of
the
japanese
who
are
engaged
in
their
heroic
work
of
establishing
sound
methods
of
government
and
education
one
would
think
that
in
england
had
originated
the
characters
by
which
the
english
people
write
the
paper
upon
which
they
print
the
figures
by
which
they
reckon
the
compass
by
which
they
navigate
the
gunpowder
by
which
they
subjugate
the
religion
with
which
they
worship
indeed
when
one
looks
over
the
long
list
of
countries
upon
which
england
has
drawn
for
the
arts
of
music
painting
sculpture
architecture
printing
engraving
and
a
host
of
other
things
it
certainly
comes
with
an
from
natives
of
that
country
to
taunt
the
japanese
with
being
imitators
it
would
be
obviously
absurd
to
suggest
as
a
model
for
our
own
houses
such
a
structure
as
a
japanese
house
leaving
out
the
fact
that
it
is
not
adapted
to
the
rigor
of
our
climate
or
to
the
habits
of
our
people
its
fragile
and
delicate
fittings
if
adopted
by
us
would
be
reduced
to
a
mass
of
kindlings
in
a
week
by
the
rude
knocks
it
would
receive
and
as
for
exposing
on
our
public
thoroughfares
the
delicate
labyrinth
of
carvings
often
seen
on
panel
and
post
in
japan
the
vandalism
of
our
country
would
render
futile
all
such
attempts
to
civilize
and
refine
fortunately
in
that
land
which
we
had
in
our
former
ignorance
and
prejudice
regarded
as
uncivilized
the
malevolent
form
of
the
called
vandal
is
unknown
believing
that
the
japanese
show
infinitely
greater
refinement
in
their
methods
of
than
we
do
and
convinced
that
their
tastes
are
normally
artistic
i
have
endeavored
to
emphasize
my
convictions
by
holding
up
in
contrast
our
usual
methods
of
and
outside
embellishments
by
so
doing
i
do
not
mean
to
imply
that
we
do
not
have
in
america
interiors
that
show
the
most
perfect
refinement
and
taste
or
that
in
japan
on
the
other
hand
interiors
may
not
be
found
in
which
good
taste
is
wanting
i
do
not
expect
to
do
much
good
in
thus
pointing
out
what
i
believe
to
be
better
methods
resting
on
more
refined
standards
there
are
some
i
am
sure
who
will
approve

the

professor
huxley
has
said
in
one
of
his
lectures
that
if
all
the
books
in
the
world
were
destroyed
with
the
exception
of
the
philosophical
transactions
it
is
safe
to
say
that
the
foundations
of
physical
science
would
remain
unshaken
and
that
the
vast
intellectual
progress
of
the
last
two
centuries
would
be
largely
though
incompletely
in
a
similar
way
it
might
almost
be
said
of
the
japan
mail
that
if
all
the
books
which
have
been
written
by
foreigners
upon
japan
were
destroyed
and
files
of

alone
preserved

shows
that

it

be
if
it
increased

though

that

nevertheless
the
complaints
that
go
up
in

show
the
existence

those
people
who
are
accustomed
to
go
without

says
in
many
parts
of
india
there
is
a
profound
suspicion
of
the
irreligiousness
of
clothing
the
fakir
is
distressed
even
by
the
regulation
rag
upon
which
the
government
modestly
insists
and
a
fully

fakir
would

expressed
the
belief
that
india
would

that
if
a

degree
of

the

has
gradually
become
in
the

associated
with
morality

the
traditions
of

may
have
equally
connected

with

than
with

purity

says
the
cleanliness
of

is
one
of
his
most
commendable
qualities
it
is
apparent
in
his
body
in
his
house
in
his
workshop
and
no
less
in
the
great
carefulness
and
exemplary
exactness
with
which
he
looks
after
his
from
the
name
which
means
literally
bed
of

it
is
supposed
that
in
ancient
times
the
bed
was
made
or
placed
in
this
recess
in
this
connection
it
may
be
interesting
to
mention
the
various
names
applied
to

the
japanese

of
the

the
a
convenience
for
washing
the
hands
being
always
near

is
a
very
common
name
for
this
place
the
word
riyo
though
not
applied
to
this
place
has
the
same
meaning
it
implies
reserve
these
words
with
their
meanings
certainly
indicate
a
great
degree
of
refinement

delicacy

terms
applied

korschelt
has
made
an
extremely
valuable
contribution
to
the
asiatic
society

japan
on
the
of
tokio
aided
by
japanese
students
he
has
made
many
analyses
of
and
waters
from
the
city
supply
and
shows
that
contrary
to
the
conclusions
of
professor
atkinson
the
wells
are
on
the
whole
much
purer
than
those
on
lower
ground
korschelt
also
calls
attention
to
the
great
number
of
artesian
wells
sunk
in
tokio
by
means
of
bamboo
tubes
driven
into
the
ground
the
ordinary
form
of
well
is
carried
down
thirty
or
forty
feet
in
the
usual
way
and
then
at
the
bottom
bamboo
tubes
are
driven
to
great
depths
ranging
from
one
hundred
to
two
hundred
feet
and
more
he
speaks
of
a
number
of
these
wells
in
tokio
and
the
suburbs
as
overflowing
there
is
one
well
not
far
from
the
tokio
daigaku
which
overflows
and
a
very
remarkable
sight
it
is
to
see
the
water
pouring
over
a
high
curb
and
flooding
the
ground
in
the
vicinity
he
shows
that
pure
water
may
be
reached
in
most
parts
of
tokio
by
means
of
artesian
wells
and
to
this
source
the

must
ultimately
look
