notes
william
harrison
ainsworth
was
born
in
king
street
manchester
february
in
a
house
that
has
long
since
been
demolished
his
father
was
a
solicitor
in
good
practice
and
the
son
had
all
the
advantages
that
educational
facilities
could
afford
he
was
sent
to
the
manchester
and
in
one
of
his
early
novels
has
left
an
interesting
and
accurate
picture
of
its
then
condition
which
may
be
contrasted
with
that
of
an
earlier
period
left
by
the
english
at
sixteen
a
brilliant
handsome
youth
with
more
taste
for
romance
and
the
drama
than
for
the
dry
details
of
the
law
he
was
articled
to
a
leading
solicitor
of
manchester
the
closest
friend
of
his
youth
was
a
james
crossley
who
was
some
years
older
but
shared
his
intellectual
taste
and
literary
enthusiasm
a
drama
written
for
private
theatricals
in
his
father
house
was
printed
in
and
he
also
contributed
to
the
the
and
the
he
even
started
a
periodical
which
received
the
name
of
and
died
at
the
sixth
number
many
of
the
fugitive
pieces
of
these
early
days
were
collected
in
volumes
now
exceedingly
rare
december
tales
london
which
is
not
wholly
from
his
pen
the
works
of
cheviot
tichburn
london
manchester
dedicated
to
charles
lamb
and
a
summer
evening
tale
london
sir
john
chiverton
appeared
in
and
for
forty
years
was
regarded
as
one
of
his
early
works
but
john
partington
aston
has
also
claimed
to
be
its
author
in
all
probability
both
of
these
young
men
joined
in
the
production
of
the
novel
which
attracted
the
attention
of
sir
walter
scott
on
the
death
of
his
father
in
ainsworth
went
to
london
to
finish
his
legal
education
but
whatever
intentions
he
may
have
formed
of
humdrum
study
and
determined
attention
to
the
details
of
a
profession
in
which
he
had
no
interest
were
dissipated
by
contact
with
the
literary
world
of
the
metropolis
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
john
ebers
who
at
that
time
combined
the
duties
of
manager
of
the
opera
house
with
the
business
of
a
publisher
he
it
was
who
issued
sir
john
chiverton
and
the
verses
forming
its
dedication
are
understood
to
have
been
addressed
to
anne
frances
fanny
ebers
whom
ainsworth
married
october
ainsworth
had
then
to
decide
upon
a
career
and
acting
upon
the
suggestion
of
ebers
his
he
began
business
as
a
publisher
but
after
an
experience
of
about
eighteen
months
he
abandoned
it
in
this
brief
interval
he
introduced
the
hon
norton
and
ude
the
cook
to
the
discerning
though
unequal
admiration
of
the
british
public
he
was
introduced
to
sir
walter
scott
who
wrote
the
bonnets
of
bonnie
dundee
for
an
annual
issued
by
him
ainsworth
gave
him
twenty
guineas
for
it
which
sir
walter
accepted
but
laughingly
handed
over
to
the
little
daughter
of
lockhart
in
whose
london
house
they
had
met
ainsworth
literary
aspirations
still
burned
with
undiminished
ardor
and
several
plans
were
formed
only
to
be
abandoned
and
when
in
the
summer
of
he
visited
switzerland
and
italy
he
was
as
far
as
ever
from
the
fulfilment
of
his
desires
in
he
visited
chesterfield
and
began
the
novel
of
rookwood
in
which
he
successfully
applied
the
method
of
radcliffe
to
english
scenes
and
characters
the
finest
passage
is
that
relating
turpin
ride
to
york
which
is
a
marvel
of
descriptive
writing
it
was
written
apparently
in
a
glow
of
inspiration
in
less
than
a
day
and
a
half
the
feat
he
says
for
feat
it
was
being
the
composition
of
a
hundred
novel
pages
in
less
than
hours
was
achieved
at
elms
a
house
i
then
occupied
at
kilburn
the
success
of
rookwood
was
marked
and
immediate
ainsworth
at
a
bound
reached
popularity
this
was
in
and
in
he
published
crichton
which
is
a
fine
piece
of
historical
romance
the
critics
who
had
objected
to
the
romantic
glamor
cast
over
the
career
of
dick
turpin
were
still
further
horrified
at
the
manner
in
which
that
vulgar
rascal
jack
sheppard
was
elevated
into
a
hero
of
romance
the
outcry
was
not
entirely
without
justification
nor
was
it
without
effect
on
the
novelist
who
thenceforward
avoided
this
perilous
ground
jack
sheppard
appeared
in
of
which
ainsworth
became
editor
in
march
at
a
monthly
salary
of
the
story
is
powerfully
written
in
he
received
from
the
for
old
paul
and
he
in
had
from
the
same
source
another
for
the
lancashire
witches
in
he
began
the
publication
of
which
came
to
an
end
in
when
he
acquired
the
monthly
which
he
edited
for
many
years
this
was
the
heyday
of
ainsworth
reputation
alike
in
literature
and
in
society
his
home
at
kensal
manor
house
became
famous
for
its
hospitality
and
dickens
thackeray
landseer
clarkson
stanfield
talfourd
jerrold
and
cruikshank
were
among
his
guests
the
list
of
his
principal
historical
novels
with
their
dates
of
issue
may
now
be
given

all
met
with
a
certain
amount
of
success
but
those
of
later
years
did
not
attain
the
striking
popularity
of
his
earlier
efforts
many
have
been
translated
into
various
modern
languages
and
the
editions
of
his
various
works
are
so
numerous
that
some
pages
of
the
british
museum
catalogue
are
devoted
to
his
works
the
scenery
and
history
of
his
native
country
had
a
perennial
interest
for
him
and
a
certain
group
of
his
novels
that
is
the
lancashire
witches
guy
fawkes
the
manchester
rebels
may
almost
be
said
to
form
a
novelist
history
of
lancashire
from
the
pilgrimage
of
grace
until
the
early
part
of
the
present
century
probably
no
more
vivid
account
has
been
written
of
the
great
fire
and
plague
of
london
than
that
given
in
old
st
paul
the
charm
of
ainsworth
novels
is
not
at
all
dependent
upon
the
analysis
of
motives
or
subtle
description
of
character
of
this
he
has
little
or
nothing
but
he
realizes
vividly
a
scene
or
an
incident
and
conveys
the
impression
with
great
force
and
directness
to
the
reader
mind
ainsworth
came
upon
the
reading
world
at
a
happy
moment
people
were
weary
of
the
inanities
of
the
fashionable
novel
and
were
ready
to
listen
to
one
who
had
a
power
of
vivacious
narrative
in
when
he
was
in
his
year
a
pleasant
tribute
of
respect
and
admiration
was
paid
to
him
in
his
native
town
the
mayor
of
manchester
entertained
him
at
a
banquet
in
the
town
hall
september
as
an
expression
of
the
high
esteem
in
which
he
is
held
by
his
and
of
his
services
to
literature
in
proposing
ainsworth
health
the
mayor
gave
a
curious
instance
of
the
popularity
of
his
writings
in
our
manchester
public
free
libraries
there
are
two
hundred
and
fifty
volumes
of
ainsworth
different
works
during
the
last
twelve
months
these
volumes
have
been
read
seven
thousand
six
hundred
and
sixty
times
mostly
by
the
artisan
class
of
readers
and
this
means
that
twenty
volumes
of
his
works
are
being
perused
in
manchester
by
readers
of
the
free
libraries
every
day
all
the
year
through
it
was
well
that
this
pleasant
recognition
was
not
longer
delayed
the
contrast
was
pathetically
great
between
the
tall
handsome
dandified
figure
presented
in
the
portraits
of
him
by
pickersgill
and
maclise
and
the
bent
and
feeble
old
man
who
stood
by
and
acknowledged
the
plaudits
of
those
who
had
assembled
to
honor
him
his
last
published
work
was
stanley
brereton
which
he
dedicated
to
his
hospitable
entertainer
he
died
at
reigate
january
leaving
a
widow
and
also
three
daughters
by
his
first
marriage
he
was
buried
at
kensal
green
cemetery
with
the
exception
of
george
gleig
he
was
the
last
survivor
of
the
brilliant
group
who
wrote
for
the
early
numbers
of
and
though
he
died
in
harness
had
outlived
nearly
all
the
associates
of
the
days
when
he
first
achieved
fame
my
when
i
inscribed
this
romance
to
you
my
dear
mother
on
its
first
appearance
i
was
satisfied
that
whatever
reception
it
might
meet
with
elsewhere
at
your
hands
it
would
be
sure
of
indulgence
since
then
the
approbation
your
partiality
would
scarcely
have
withheld
has
been
liberally
accorded
by
the
public
and
i
have
the
satisfaction
of
reflecting
that
in
following
the
dictates
of
affection
which
prompted
me
to
select
the
dearest
friend
i
had
in
the
world
as
the
subject
of
a
dedication
i
have
not
overstepped
the
limits
of
prudence
nor
in
connecting
your
honored
name
with
this
trifling
production
involved
you
in
a
failure
which
had
it
occurred
would
have
given
you
infinitely
more
concern
than
myself
after
a
lapse
of
three
years
during
which
my
little
bark
fanned
by
pleasant
and
prosperous
breezes
has
sailed
more
than
once
securely
into
port
i
again
commit
it
to
the
waters
with
more
confidence
than
heretofore
and
with
a
firmer
reliance
that
if
it
should
be
found
after
many
days
it
may
prove
a
slight
memorial
of
the
warmest
filial
regard
exposed
to
trials
of
no
ordinary
difficulty
and
visited
by
domestic
affliction
of
no
common
severity
you
my
dear
mother
have
borne
up
against
the
ills
of
life
with
a
fortitude
and
resignation
which
those
who
know
you
best
can
best
appreciate
but
which
none
can
so
well
understand
or
so
thoroughly
appreciate
as
myself
suffering
is
the
lot
of
all
submission
under
the
dispensation
is
permitted
to
few
and
it
is
my
fervent
hope
that
my
own
children
may
emulate
your
virtues
if
they
are
happily
spared
your
sorrows
during
a
visit
to
chesterfield
in
the
autumn
of
the
year
i
first
conceived
the
notion
of
writing
this
story
wishing
to
describe
somewhat
minutely
the
trim
gardens
the
picturesque
domains
the
groves
the
gloomy
chambers
and
gloomier
galleries
of
an
ancient
hall
with
which
i
was
acquainted
i
resolved
to
attempt
a
story
in
the
bygone
style
of
radcliffe
which
had
always
inexpressible
charms
for
me
substituting
an
old
english
squire
an
old
english
manorial
residence
and
an
old
english
highwayman
for
the
italian
marchese
the
castle
and
the
brigand
of
the
great
mistress
of
romance
while
revolving
this
subject
i
happened
one
evening
to
enter
the
spacious
cemetery
attached
to
the
church
with
the
queer
twisted
steeple
which
like
the
uplifted
tail
of
the
renowned
dragon
of
wantley
to
whom
houses
and
churches
were
as
capons
and
turkeys
seems
to
menace
the
good
town
of
chesterfield
with
destruction
here
an
incident
occurred
on
the
opening
of
a
vault
which
it
is
needless
to
relate
but
which
supplied
me
with
a
hint
for
the
commencement
of
my
romance
as
well
as
for
the
ballad
entitled
the
coffin
upon
this
hint
i
immediately
acted
and
the
earlier
chapters
of
the
book
together
with
the
description
of
the
ancestral
mansion
of
the
rookwoods
were
completed
before
i
quitted
chesterfield
another
and
much
larger
portion
of
the
work
was
written
during
a
residence
at
rottingdean
in
sussex
in
the
latter
part
of
and
owes
its
inspiration
to
many
delightful
walks
over
the
south
downs
was
pleasant
occupation
then
the
ride
to
york
was
completed
in
one
day
and
one
night
this
feat
for
a
feat
it
was
being
the
composition
of
a
hundred
ordinary
novel
pages
in
less
than
hours
was
achieved
at
the
elms
a
house
i
then
occupied
at
kilburn
well
do
i
remember
the
fever
into
which
i
was
thrown
during
the
time
of
composition
my
pen
literally
scoured
over
the
pages
so
thoroughly
did
i
identify
myself
with
the
flying
highwayman
that
once
started
i
found
it
impossible
to
halt
animated
by
kindred
enthusiasm
i
cleared
every
obstacle
in
my
path
with
as
much
facility
as
turpin
disposed
of
the
impediments
that
beset
his
flight
in
his
company
i
mounted
the
dashed
through
the
bustling
village
swept
over
the
desolate
heath
threaded
the
silent
street
plunged
into
the
eddying
stream
and
kept
an
onward
course
without
pause
without
hindrance
without
fatigue
with
him
i
shouted
sang
laughed
exulted
wept
nor
did
i
retire
to
rest
till
in
imagination
i
heard
the
bell
of
york
minster
toll
forth
the
knell
of
poor
black
bess
the
supernatural
occurrence
forming
the
groundwork
of
one
of
the
ballads
which
i
have
made
the
harbinger
of
doom
to
the
house
of
rookwood
is
ascribed
by
popular
superstition
to
a
family
resident
in
sussex
upon
whose
estate
the
fatal
tree
a
gigantic
lime
with
mighty
arms
and
huge
girth
of
trunk
as
described
in
the
song
is
still
carefully
preserved
cuckfield
place
to
which
this
singular
piece
of
timber
is
attached
is
i
may
state
for
the
benefit
of
the
curious
the
real
rookwood
hall
for
i
have
not
drawn
upon
imagination
but
upon
memory
in
describing
the
seat
and
domains
of
that
fated
family
the
general
features
of
the
venerable
structure
several
of
its
chambers
the
old
garden
and
in
particular
the
noble
park
with
its
spreading
prospects
its
picturesque
views
of
the
hall
like
bits
of
radcliffe
as
the
poet
shelley
once
observed
of
the
same
scene
its
deep
glades
through
which
the
deer
come
lightly
tripping
down
its
uplands
slopes
brooks
brakes
coverts
and
groves
are
carefully
delineated
the
superstition
of
a
fallen
branch
affording
a
presage
of
approaching
death
is
not
peculiar
to
the
family
i
have
mentioned
many
other
old
houses
have
been
equally
favored
in
fact
there
is
scarcely
an
ancient
family
in
the
kingdom
without
a
boding
sign
for
instance
the
breretons
of
brereton
in
cheshire
were
warned
by
the
appearance
of
stocks
of
trees
floating
like
the
swollen
bodies
of
men
upon
the
surface
of
a
sombre
lake
called
blackmere
from
the
inky
color
of
its
waters
adjoining
their
residence
and
numerous
other
examples
might
be
given
the
of
the
breretons
is
alluded
to
by
drayton
in
the
it
has
been
well
observed
by
barry
cornwall
that
the
songs
which
occur
in
dramas
are
more
natural
than
those
which
proceed
from
the
author
in
person
with
equal
force
does
the
reasoning
apply
to
the
romance
which
may
be
termed
the
drama
of
the
closet
it
would
seem
strange
on
a
first
view
that
an
author
should
be
more
at
home
in
an
assumed
character
than
his
own
but
experience
shows
the
position
to
be
correct
conscious
he
is
no
longer
individually
associated
with
his
work
the
writer
proceeds
with
all
the
freedom
of
irresponsibility
his
idiosyncrasy
is
merged
in
that
of
the
personages
he
represents
he
thinks
with
their
thoughts
sees
with
their
eyes
speaks
with
their
tongues
his
strains
are
such
as
he
himself
would
not
perhaps
could
not
have
originated
in
this
light
he
may
be
said
to
bring
to
his
subject
not
one
mind
but
several
he
becomes
not
one
poet
but
many
for
each
actor
in
his
drama
has
a
share
and
an
important
share
in
the
lyrical
to
which
he
gives
birth
this
it
is
which
has
imparted
any
verve
variety
or
dramatic
character
they
possess
to
the
ballads
contained
in
this
production
turpin
i
look
upon
as
the
real
songster
of
black
bess
to
jerry
juniper
i
am
unquestionably
indebted
for
a
flash
melody
which
without
his
hint
would
never
have
been
written
while
to
the
sexton
i
owe
the
solitary
gleam
of
light
i
have
been
enabled
to
throw
upon
the
horrors
and
mystery
of
the
churchyard
as
i
have
casually
alluded
to
the
flash
song
of
jerry
juniper
i
may
perhaps
be
allowed
to
make
a
few
observations
upon
this
branch
of
versification
it
is
somewhat
curious
with
a
dialect
so
racy
idiomatic
and
plastic
as
our
own
cant
that
its
metrical
capabilities
should
have
been
so
little
essayed
the
french
have
numerous
ranging
from
the
time
of
charles
bourdigné
and
villon
down
to
that
of
vidocq
and
victor
hugo
the
last
of
whom
has
enlivened
the
horrors
of
his
jour
by
a
festive
song
of
this
class
the
spaniards
possess
a
large
collection
of
de
by
various
authors
amongst
whom
quevedo
holds
a
distinguished
place
we
on
the
contrary
have
scarcely
any
slang
songs
of
merit
with
a
race
of
depredators
so
melodious
and
convivial
as
our
highwaymen
this
is
the
more
to
be
wondered
at
had
they
no
bards
amongst
their
bands
was
there
no
minstrel
at
hand
to
record
their
exploits
i
can
only
call
to
mind
one
robber
who
was
a
poet
delany
and
was
an
irishman
this
barrenness
i
have
shown
is
not
attributable
to
the
poverty
of
the
soil
but
to
the
want
of
due
cultivation
materials
are
at
hand
in
abundance
but
there
have
been
few
operators
dekker
beaumont
and
fletcher
and
ben
jonson
have
all
dealt
largely
in
this
jargon
but
not
lyrically
and
one
of
the
earliest
and
best
specimens
of
a
occurs
in
brome
and
in
the
of
bamfylde
moore
there
is
a
solitary
ode
addressed
by
the
mendicant
fraternity
to
their
monarch
but
it
has
little
humor
and
can
scarcely
be
called
a
genuine
this
ode
brings
us
down
to
our
own
time
to
the
effusions
of
the
illustrious
pierce
egan
to
tom
moore
flights
of
to
john
jackson

to

quite

and
here
as
the
candidates
are
so
few
and
their
pretensions
so
humble
i
ca
help
putting
in
my
claim
for
praise
i
venture
to
affirm
that
i
have
done
something
more
than
has
been
accomplished
by
my
predecessors
or
contemporaries
with
the
significant
language
under
consideration
i
have
written
a
purely
flash
song
of
which
the
great
and
peculiar
merit
consists
in
its
being
utterly
incomprehensible
to
the
uninformed
understanding
while
its
meaning
must
be
perfectly
clear
and
perspicuous
to
the
practised
of
or
i
have
moreover
been
the
first
to
introduce
and
naturalize
amongst
us
a
measure
which
though
common
enough
in
the
argotic
minstrelsy
of
france
has
been
hitherto
utterly
unknown
to
our
poetry
some
years
afterwards
the
song
alluded
to
better
known
under
the
title
of
my
dolly
pals
fake
away
sprang
into
extraordinary
popularity
being
set
to
music
by
rodwell
and
chanted
by
glorious
paul
bedford
and
clever
little
keeley
before
quitting
the
subject
of
these
songs
i
may
mention
that
they
probably
would
not
have
been
written
at
all
if
one
of
the
earliest
of
them
a
chance
experiment
had
not
excited
the
warm
approbation
of
my
friend
charles
ollier
author
of
the
striking
romance
of
ferrers
this
induced
me
to
prosecute
the
vein
accidentally
opened
turpin
was
the
hero
of
my
boyhood
i
had
always
a
strange
passion
for
highwaymen
and
have
listened
by
the
hour
to
their
exploits
as
narrated
by
my
father
and
especially
to
those
of
dauntless
dick
that
chief
minion
of
the
moon
one
of
turpin
adventures
in
particular
the
ride
to
hough
green
which
took
deep
hold
of
my
fancy
i
have
recorded
in
song
when
a
boy
i
have
often
lingered
by
the
side
of
the
deep
old
road
where
this
robbery
was
committed
to
cast
wistful
glances
into
its
mysterious
windings
and
when
night
deepened
the
shadows
of
the
trees
have
urged
my
horse
on
his
journey
from
a
vague
apprehension
of
a
visit
from
the
ghostly
highwayman
and
then
there
was
the
bollin
with
its
shelvy
banks
which
turpin
cleared
at
a
bound
the
broad
meadows
over
which
he
winged
his
flight
the
pleasant
of
the
pleasant
old
inn
at
hough
where
he
produced
his
watch
to
the
cheshire
squires
with
whom
he
was
upon
terms
of
intimacy
all
brought
something
of
the
gallant
robber
to
mind
no
wonder
in
in
selecting
a
highwayman
for
a
character
in
a
tale
i
should
choose
my
old
favorite
dick
turpin
in
reference
to
two
of
the
characters
here
introduced
and
drawn
from
personages
living
at
the
time
the
tale
was
written
it
may
be
mentioned
that
poor
jerry
juniper
met
his
death
from
an
accident
at
chichester
while
he
was
proceeding
to
goodwood
races
and
that
the
knight
of
malta
tom
a
brewer
of
truro
the
sir
william
courtenay
who
played
the
strange
tricks
at
canterbury
chronicled
in
a
song
given
in
these
pages
after
his
release
from
banning
heath
asylum
was
shot
through
the
head
while
leading
on
a
mob
of
riotous
kentish
yeomen
whom
he
had
persuaded
that
he
was
the
messiah
if
the
design
of
romance
be
what
it
has
been
held
the
exposition
of
a
useful
truth
by
means
of
an
interesting
story
i
fear
i
have
but
imperfectly
fulfilled
the
office
imposed
upon
me
having
as
i
will
freely
confess
had
throughout
an
eye
rather
to
the
amusement
than
his
edification
one
wholesome
moral
however
may
i
trust
be
gathered
from
the
perusal
of
this
tale
namely
that
without
due
governance
of
the
passions
high
aspirations
and
generous
emotions
will
little
avail
their
possessor
the
impersonations
of
the
tempter
the
tempted
and
the
better
influence
may
be
respectively
discovered
by
those
who
care
to
cull
the
honey
from
the
flower
in
the
sexton
in
luke
and
in
sybil
the
chief
object
i
had
in
view
in
making
the
present
essay
was
to
see
how
far
the
infusion
of
a
warmer
and
more
genial
current
into
the
veins
of
old
romance
would
succeed
in
reviving
her
fluttering
and
feeble
pulses
the
attempt
has
succeeded
beyond
my
most
sanguine
expectation
romance
if
i
am
not
mistaken
is
destined
shortly
to
undergo
an
important
change
modified
by
the
german
and
french
writers
by
hoffman
tieck
hugo
dumas
balzac
and
paul
lecroix
bibliophile
the
structure
commenced
in
our
own
land
by
horace
walpole
monk
lewis
radcliffe
and
maturin
but
left
imperfect
and
inharmonious
requires
now
that
the
rubbish
which
choked
up
its
approach
is
removed
only
the
hand
of
the
skilful
architect
to
its
entire
renovation
and
perfection
and
now
having
said
my
say
i
must
bid
you
worthy

farewell

wedding
it
has
been
observed
and
i
am
apt
to
believe
it
is
an
observation
which
will
generally
be
found
true
that
before
a
terrible
truth
comes
to
light
there
are
certain
murmuring
whispers
fly
before
it
and
prepare
the
minds
of
men
for
the
reception

of

let
me
know
therefore
fully
the
intent
of
this
thy
dismal
preparation
this
talk
fit
for
a
charnel
webster
within
a
sepulchral
vault
and
at
midnight
two
persons
were
seated
the
chamber
was
of
singular
construction
and
considerable
extent
the
roof
was
of
solid
stone
masonry
and
rose
in
a
wide
semicircular
arch
to
the
height
of
about
seventeen
feet
measured
from
the
centre
of
the
ceiling
to
the
ground
floor
while
the
sides
were
divided
by
slight
into
ranges
of
low
narrow
catacombs
the
entrance
to
each
cavity
was
surrounded
by
an
arch
resting
upon
slender
granite
pillars
and
the
intervening
space
was
filled
up
with
a
variety
of
tablets
escutcheons
shields
and
inscriptions
recording
the
titles
and
heraldic
honors
of
the
departed
there
were
no
doors
to
the
niches
and
within
might
be
seen
piles
of
coffins
packed
one
upon
another
till
the
floor
groaned
with
the
weight
of
lead
against
one
of
the
pillars
upon
a
hook
hung
a
rack
of
tattered
hatchments
and
in
the
centre
of
the
tomb
might
be
seen
the
effigies
of
sir
ranulph
de
rokewode
the
builder
of
the
mausoleum
and
the
founder
of
the
race
who
slept
within
its
walls
this
statue
wrought
in
black
marble
differed
from
most
monumental
in
that
its
posture
was
erect
and
lifelike
sir
ranulph
was
represented
as
sheathed
in
a
complete
suit
of
mail
decorated
with
his
emblazoned
and
gilded
surcoat
his
arm
leaning
upon
the
pommel
of
a
weighty
the
attitude
was
that
of
stern
repose
a
helmet
rested
upon
the
brow
the
beaver
was
raised
and
revealed
harsh
but
commanding
features
the
golden
spur
of
knighthood
was
fixed
upon
the
heel
and
at
the
feet
enshrined
in
a
costly
sarcophagus
of
marble
dug
from
the
same
quarry
as
the
statue
rested
the
mortal
remains
of
one
of
the
sternest
knights
to
his
mortal
foe
that
ever
put
speare
in
the
rest
streaming
in
a
wavering
line
upon
the
roof
the
sickly
flame
of
a
candle
partially
fell
upon
the
human
figures
before
alluded
to
throwing
them
into
darkest
relief
and
casting
their
opaque
and
fantastical
shadows
along
the
ground
an
old
coffin
upon
a
bier
we
have
said
served
the
mysterious
twain
for
a
seat
between
them

a
bottle
and
a
glass

that
whatever
might
be
the
ulterior
object
of
their
stealthy
communion

immediate
comfort
of
the
creature

not
been
altogether
overlooked
at
the
feet
of

of
the
personages

laid
a
mattock
a
horn
lantern
from
which
the
candle
had
been
removed

crowbar
and
a
bunch
of
keys
near
to
these
implements
of
a
vocation
which
the
reader
will
readily
surmise
rested
a
strange
superannuated
terrier
with
a
wiry
back
and
frosted
muzzle
a
head
minus
an
ear
and
a
leg
wanting
a
paw
his
master
for
such
we
shall
suppose
him
was
an
old
man
with
a
lofty
forehead
covered
with
a
singularly
shaped
nightcap
and
clothed
as
to
his
lower
limbs
with
tight
ribbed
gray
worsted
hose
ascending
externally
after
a
bygone
fashion
considerably
above
the
knee
the
old
man
elbow
rested
upon
the
handle
of
his
spade
his
wrist
supported
his
chin
and
his
gray
glassy
eyes
glimmering
like
in
the
were
fixed
upon
his
companion
with
a
glance
of
searching
scrutiny
the
object
of
his
investigation
a
much
more
youthful
and
interesting
person
seemed
lost
in
reverie
and
alike
insensible
to
time
place
and
the
object
of
the
meeting
with
both
hands
grasped
round
the
barrel
of
a
and
his
face
leaning
upon
the
same
support
the
features
were
entirely
concealed
from
view
the
light
too
being
at
the
back
and
shedding
its
rays
over
rather
than
upon
his
person
aided
his
disguise
yet
even
thus
imperfectly
defined
the
outline
of
the
head
and
the
proportions
of
the
figure
were
eminently
striking
and
symmetrical
attired
in
a
rough
forester
costume
of
the
mode
of
and
of
the
roughest
texture
and
rudest
make
his
wild
garb
would
have
determined
his
rank
as
sufficiently
humble
in
the
scale
of
society
had
not
a
certain
loftiness
of
manner
and
bold
though
reckless
deportment
argued
pretensions
on
the
part
of
the
wearer
to
a
more
elevated
station
in
life
and
contradicted
in
a
great
measure
the
impression
produced
by
the
homely
appearance
of
his
habiliments
a
cap
of
shaggy
brown
fur
fancifully
but
not
ungracefully
fashioned
covered
his
head
from
beneath
which
dropping
in
natural
clusters
over
his
neck
and
shoulders
a
cloud
of
raven
hair
escaped
subsequently
when
his
face
was
more
fully
revealed
it
proved
to
be
that
of
a
young
man
of
dark
aspect
and
grave
melancholy
expression
of
countenance
approaching
even
to
the
stern
when
at
rest
though
sufficiently
animated
and
earnest
when
engaged
in
conversation
or
otherwise
excited
his
features
were
regular
delicately
formed
and
might
be
characterized
as
singularly
handsome
were
it
not
for
a
want
of
roundness
in
the
contour
of
the
face
which
gave
the
lineaments
a
thin
worn
look
totally
distinct
however
from
haggardness
or
emaciation
the
nose
was
delicate
and
fine
the
nostril
especially
so
the
upper
lip
was
short
curling
graceful
and
haughtily
expressive
as
to
complexion
his
skin
had
a
truly
spanish
warmth
and
intensity
of
coloring
his
figure
when
raised
was
tall
and
masculine
and
though
slight
exhibited
great
personal
vigor
we
will
now
turn
to
his
companion
the
old
man
with
the
great
gray
glittering
eyes
peter
bradley
of
rookwood
comitatû
ebor
where
he
had
exercised
the
vocation
of
sexton
for
the
best
part
of
a
life
already
drawn
out
to
the
full
span
ordinarily
allotted
to
mortality
was
an
odd
caricature
of
humanity
his
figure
was
lean
and
almost
as
lank
as
a
skeleton
his
bald
head
reminded
one
of
a
bleached
skull
allowing
for
the
overhanging
and
hoary
brows
and
sunken
within
their
sockets
his
gray
orbs
gleamed
with
intolerable
lustre
few
could
endure
his
gaze
and
aware
of
his
power
peter
seldom
failed
to
exercise
it
he
had
likewise
another
habit
which
as
it
savored
of
insanity
made
him
an
object
of
commiseration
with
some
while
it
rendered
him
yet
more
obnoxious
to
others
the
habit
we
allude
to
was
the
indulgence
of
wild
screaming
laughter
at
times
when
all
merriment
should
be
checked
and
when
the
exhibition
of
levity
must
proceed
from
utter
disregard
of
human
grief
and
suffering
or
from
mental
alienation
wearied
with
the
prolonged
silence
peter
at
length
condescended
to
speak
his
voice
was
harsh
and
grating
as
a
rusty
hinge
another
glass
said
he
pouring
out
a
modicum
of
the
pale
fluid
his
companion
shook
his
head
it
will
keep
out
the
cold
continued
the
sexton
pressing
the
liquid
upon
him
and
you
who
are
not
so
much
accustomed
as
i
am
to
the
damps
of
a
vault
may
suffer
from
them
besides
added
he
sneeringly
it
will
give
you
courage
his
companion
answered
not
but
the
flash
of
his
eye
resented
the
implied
reproach
nay
never
stare
at
me
so
hard
luke
continued
the
sexton
i
doubt
neither
your
courage
nor
your
firmness
but
if
you
wo
drink
i
will
here
to
the
rest
eternal
of
sir
piers
rookwood
you
say
amen
to
that
pledge
or
you
are
neither
grandson
of
mine
nor
offspring
of
his
loins
why
should
i
reverence
his
memory
answered
luke
bitterly
refusing
the
proffered
potion
who
showed
no
fatherly
love
for
me
he
disowned
in
life
in
death
i
disown
sir
piers
rookwood
was
no
father
of
mine
he
was
as
certainly
your
father
as
susan
bradley
your
mother
was
my
daughter
rejoined
the
sexton
and
surely
cried
luke
impetuously
need
not
boast
of
the
connection
is
not
for
you
old
man
to
couple
their
names
together
to
exult
in
your
daughter
disgrace
and
your
own
dishonor
shame
shame
speak
not
of
them
in
the
same
breath
if
you
would
not
have
me
invoke
curses
on
the
dead
have
no
reverence
whatever
may
have
for
the
seducer
for
the
murderer
of
my
mother
you
have
choice
store
of
epithets
in
sooth
good
grandson
rejoined
peter
with
a
chuckling
laugh
sir
piers
a
murderer
tush
exclaimed
luke
indignantly
affect
not
ignorance
you
have
better
knowledge
than
i
have
of
the
truth
or
falsehood
of
the
dark
tale
that
has
gone
abroad
respecting
my
mother
fate
and
unless
report
has
belied
you
foully
had
substantial
reasons
for
keeping
sealed
lips
on
the
occasion
but
to
change
this
painful
subject
added
he
with
a
sudden
alteration
of
manner
at
what
hour
did
sir
piers
rookwood
die
on
thursday
last
in
the
the
exact
hour
i
know
not
replied
the
sexton
of
what
ailment
neither
do
i
know
that
his
end
was
sudden
yet
not
without
a
warning
sign
what
warning
inquired
luke
neither
more
nor
less
than
the
of
the
house
you
look
astonished
is
it
possible
you
have
never
heard
of
the
ominous
and
the
fatal
bough
why
is
a
common
tale
hereabouts
and
has
been
for
centuries
any
old
crone
would
tell
it
you
peradventure
you
seen
the
old
avenue
of
leading
to
the
hall
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
length
and
as
noble
a
row
of
timber
as
any
in
the
west
riding
of
yorkshire
well
there
is
one
tree
the
last
on
the
left
hand
before
you
come
to
the
larger
than
all
the
rest
a
huge
piece
of
timber
with
broad
spreading
branches
and
of
i
know
not
what
girth
in
the
trunk
that
tree
is
in
some
mysterious
manner
connected
with
the
family
of
rookwood
and
immediately
previous
to
the
death
of
one
of
that
line
a
branch
is
sure
to
be
shed
from
the
parent
stem
prognosticating
his
doom
but
you
shall
hear
the
legend
and
in
a
strange
sepulchral
tone
not
inappropriate
however
to
his
subject
peter
chanted
the
following
ballad
the
legend
of
the
amid
the
grove
above
with
old
and
tall
the
avenue
that
leads
unto
the
rookwood
ancient
hall
high
the
rest
its
towering
crest
one
tree
rears
to
the
sky
and
wide
like
mighty
wings
its
arms
umbrageously
seven
yards
its
base
would
scarce
embrace
a
goodly
tree
i
ween
with
silver
bark
and
foliage
dark
of
melancholy
green
and
mid
its
boughs
two
ravens
house
and
build
from
year
to
year
their
black
brood
hatch
their
black
brood
watch
then
screaming
disappear
in
that
old
tree
when
playfully
the
summer
breezes
sigh
its
leaves
are
stirred
and
there
is
heard
a
low
and
plaintive
cry
and
when
in
shrieks
the
storm
blast
speaks
its
reverend
boughs
among
sad
wailing
moans
like
human
groans
the
concert
harsh
prolong
but
whether
gale
or
calm
prevail
or
threatening
cloud
hath
fled
by
hand
of
fate
predestinate
a
limb
that
tree
will
shed
a
verdant
bough
untouched
i
trow
by
axe
or
tempest
breath
to
rookwood
head
an
omen
dread
of
death
some
think
that
tree
instinct
must
be
with
preternatural
power
like
bell
death
note
to
knell
at
fate
appointed
hour
while
some
avow
that
on
its
bough
are
fearful
traces
seen
red
as
the
stains
from
human
veins
commingling
with
the
green
others
again
there
are
maintain
that
on
the
shattered
bark
a
print
is
made
where
fiends
have
laid
their
scathing
talons
dark
that
ere
it
falls
the
raven
calls
thrice
from
that
wizard
bough
and
that
each
cry
doth
signify
what
space
the
fates
allow
in
olden
days
the
legend
says
as
grim
sir
ranulph
a
wretched
hag
her
footsteps
drag
beneath
his
lordly
wood
his
bloodhounds
twain
he
called
amain
and
straightway
gave
her
chase
was
never
seen
in
forest
green
so
fierce
so
fleet
a
race
with
eyes
of
flame
to
ranulph
came
each
red
and
ruthless
hound
while
mangled
torn
a
sight
forlorn
the
hag
lay
on
the
ground
where
she
lay
was
turned
the
clay
and
limb
and
reeking
bone
within
the
earth
with
ribald
mirth
by
ranulph
grim
were
thrown
and
while
as
yet
the
soil
was
wet
with
that
poor
witch
gore
a
stake
did
ranulph
take
and
pierced
her
bosom
core
and
strange
to
tell
what
next
befell
that
branch
at
once
took
root
and
richly
fed
within
its
bed
strong
suckers
forth
did
shoot
from
year
to
year
fresh
boughs
appear
it
waxes
huge
in
size
and
with
wild
glee
this
prodigy
sir
ranulph
grim
espies
one
day
when
he
beneath
that
tree
reclined
in
joy
and
pride
a
branch
was
found
upon
the
ground
the
next
sir
ranulph
died
and
from
that
hour
a
fatal
power
has
ruled
that
wizard
tree
to
ranulph
line
a
warning
sign
of
doom
and
destiny
for
when
a
bough
is
found
i
trow
beneath
its
shade
to
lie
ere
suns
shall
rise
thrice
in
the
skies
a
rookwood
sure
shall
die
and
such
an
omen
preceded
sir
piers
demise
said
luke
who
had
listened
with
some
attention
to
his
grandsire
song
unquestionably
replied
the
sexton
not
longer
ago
than
tuesday
morning
i
happened
to
be
sauntering
down
the
avenue
i
have
just
described
i
know
not
what
took
me
thither
at
that
early
hour
but
i
wandered
leisurely
on
till
i
came
nigh
the
wizard
great
heaven
what
a
surprise
awaited
me
a
huge
branch
lay
right
across
the
path
it
had
evidently
just
fallen
for
the
leaves
were
green
and
unwithered
the
sap
still
oozed
from
the
splintered
wood
and
there
was
neither
trace
of
knife
nor
hatchet
on
the
bark
i
looked
up
among
the
boughs
to
mark
the
spot
from
whence
it
had
been
torn
by
the
hand
of
fate
for
no
human
hand
had
done
it
and
saw
the
pair
of
ancestral
ravens
perched
amid
the
foliage
and
croaking
as
those
carrion
fowl
are
wont
to
do
when
they
scent
a
carcass
afar
off
just
then
a
livelier
sound
saluted
my
ears
the
cheering
cry
of
a
pack
of
hounds
resounded
from
the
courts
and
the
great
gates
being
thrown
open
out
issued
sir
piers
attended
by
a
troop
of
his
roystering
companions
all
on
horseback
and
all
making
the
welkin
ring
with
their
vociferations
sir
piers
laughed
as
loudly
as
the
rest
but
his
mirth
was
speedily
checked
no
sooner
had
his
horse
old
rook
his
favorite
steed
who
never
swerved
at
stake
or
pale
before
set
eyes
upon
the
accursed
branch
than
he
started
as
if
the
fiend
stood
before
him
and
rearing
backwards
flung
his
rider
from
the
saddle
at
this
moment
with
loud
screams
the
wizard
ravens
took
flight
sir
piers
was
somewhat
hurt
by
the
fall
but
he
was
more
frightened
than
hurt
and
though
he
tried
to
put
a
bold
face
on
the
matter
it
was
plain
that
his
efforts
to
recover
himself
were
fruitless
titus
tyrconnel
and
that
wild
fellow
jack
palmer
who
has
lately
come
to
the
hall
and
of
whom
you
know
something
tried
to
rally
him
but
it
would
not
do
he
broke
up
the
day
sport
and
returned
dejectedly
to
the
hall
before
departing
however
he
addressed
a
word
to
me
in
private
respecting
you
and
pointed
with
a
melancholy
shake
of
the
head
to
the
fatal
branch
is
my
said
he
gloomily
and
so
it
proved
two
days
afterwards
his
doom
was
accomplished
and
do
you
place
faith
in
this
idle
legend
asked
luke
with
affected
indifference
although
it
was
evident
from
his
manner
that
he
himself
was
not
so
entirely
free
from
a
superstitious
feeling
of
credulity
as
he
would
have
it
appear
certes
replied
the
sexton
i
were
more
difficult
to
be
convinced
than
the
unbelieving
disciple
else
thrice
hath
it
occurred
to
my
own
knowledge
and
ever
with
the
same
result
first
with
sir
reginald
secondly
with
thy
own
mother
and
lastly
as
i
have
just
told
thee
with
sir
piers
i
thought
you
said
even
now
that
this
death
omen
if
such
it
be
was
always
confined
to
the
immediate
family
of
rookwood
and
not
to
mere
inmates
of
the
mansion
to
the
heads
only
of
that
house
be
they
male
or
female
then
how
could
it
apply
to
my
mother
was
of
that
house
was
a
wife
who
shall
say
she
was
rejoined
the
sexton
who
shall
say
she
so
cried
luke
repeating
the
words
with
indignant
emphasis
who
will
avouch
a
smile
cold
as
a
wintry
sunbeam
played
upon
the
sexton
rigid
lips
i
will
bear
this
no
longer
cried
luke
anger
me
not
or
look
to
yourself
in
a
word
have
you
anything
to
tell
me
respecting
her
if
not
let
me
begone
i
have
but
i
will
not
be
hurried
by
a
boy
like
you
replied
peter
doggedly
go
if
you
will
and
take
the
consequences
my
lips
are
sealed
forever
and
i
have
much
to
say
much
that
it
behoves
you
to
know
be
brief
then
when
you
sought
me
out
this
morning
in
my
retreat
with
the
gipsy
gang
at
davenham
wood
you
bade
me
meet
you
in
the
porch
of
rookwood
church
at
midnight
i
was
true
to
my
appointment
and
i
will
keep
my
promise
replied
the
sexton
draw
closer
that
i
may
whisper
in
thine
ear
of
every
rookwood
who
lies
around
us
and
all
that
ever
bore
the
name
except
sir
piers
himself
who
lies
in
state
at
the
hall
are
here
not
one
mark
what
i
say
not
one
male
branch
of
the
house
but
has
been
suspected
of
what
of
murder
returned
the
sexton
in
a
hissing
whisper
murder
echoed
luke
recoiling
there
is
one
dark
stain
one
foul
blot
on
all
blood
blood
hath
been
spilt
by
all
ay
and
blood
theirs
was
no
common
crime
even
murder
hath
its
degrees
theirs
was
of
the
first
class
their
wives
you
can
not
mean
that
ay
their
wives
i
do
you
have
heard
it
then
ha
ha
is
a
trick
they
had
did
you
ever
hear
the
old
saying
mate
ever
brook
would
a
rook
of
the
rookwood
a
merry
saying
it
is
and
true
no
woman
ever
stood
in
a
rookwood
way
but
she
was
speedily
removed
that
certain
they
had
all
save
poor
sir
piers
the
knack
of
stopping
a
troublesome
woman
tongue
and
practised
it
to
perfection
a
rare
art
eh
what
have
the
misdeeds
of
his
ancestry
to
do
with
sir
piers
muttered
luke
much
less
with
my
mother
everything
if
he
could
not
rid
himself
of
his
wife
and
she
is
a
match
for
the
devil
himself
the
might
be
more
readily
set
aside
have
you
absolute
knowledge
of
aught
asked
luke
his
voice
tremulous
with
emotion
nay
i
but
hinted
such
hints
are
worse
than
open
speech
let
me
know
the
worst
did
he
kill
her
and
luke
glared
at
the
sexton
as
if
he
would
have
penetrated
his
secret
soul
but
peter
was
not
easily
fathomed
his
cold
bright
eye
returned
gaze
steadfastly
as
he
answered
composedly
i
have
said
all
i
know
but
not
all
you
thoughts
should
not
always
find
utterance
else
we
might
often
endanger
our
own
safety
and
that
of
others
an
idle
subterfuge
and
from
you
worse
than
idle
i
will
have
an
answer
yea
or
nay
was
it
poison
was
it
steel
enough
she
died
no
it
is
not
enough
when
where
in
her
sleep
in
her
bed
why
that
was
natural
a
wrinkling
smile
crossed
the
sexton
brow
what
means
that
horrible
gleam
of
laughter
exclaimed
luke
grasping
the
shoulder
of
the
man
of
graves
with
such
force
as
nearly
to
annihilate
him
speak
or
i
will
strangle
you
she
died
you
say
in
her
sleep
she
did
so
replied
the
sexton
shaking
off
luke
hold
and
was
it
to
tell
me
that
i
had
a
mother
murder
to
avenge
that
you
brought
me
to
the
tomb
of
her
destroyer
when
he
is
beyond
the
reach
of
my
vengeance
luke
exhibited
so
much
frantic
violence
of
manner
and
gesture
that
the
sexton
entertained
some
little
apprehension
that
his
intellects
were
unsettled
by
the
shock
of
the
intelligence
it
was
therefore
in
what
he
intended
for
a
soothing
tone
that
he
attempted
to
solicit
his
grandson
attention
i
will
hear
nothing
more
interrupted
luke
and
the
vaulted
chamber
rang
with
his
passionate
lamentations
am
i
the
sport
of
this
mocking
fiend
cried
he
to
whom
my
agony
is
derision
my
despair
a
source
of
enjoyment
beneath
whose
withering
glance
my
spirit
shrinks
who
with
insinuations
tortures
my
soul
awakening
fancies
that
goad
me
on
to
dark
and
desperate
deeds
dead
mother
upon
thee
i
call
if
in
thy
grave
thou
canst
hear
the
cry
of
thy
most
wretched
son
yearning
to
avenge
thee
answer
me
if
thou
hast
the
power
let
me
have
some
token
of
the
truth
or
falsity
of
these
wild
suppositions
that
i
may
wrestle
against
this
demon
but
no
added
he
in
accents
of
despair
no
ear
listens
to
me
save
his
to
whom
my
wretchedness
is
food
for
mockery
could
the
dead
hear
thee
thy
mother
might
do
so
returned
the
sexton
she
lies
within
this
space
luke
staggered
back
as
if
struck
by
a
sudden
shot
he
spoke
not
but
fell
with
a
violent
shock
against
a
pile
of
coffins
at
which
he
caught
for
support
what
have
i
done
he
exclaimed
recoiling
a
thundering
crash
resounded
through
the
vault
one
of
the
coffins
dislodged
from
its
position
by
his
fall
tumbled
to
the
ground
and
alighting
upon
its
side
split
asunder
great
heavens
what
is
this
cried
luke
as
a
dead
body
clothed
in
all
the
hideous
apparel
of
the
tomb
rolled
forth
to
his
feet
it
is
your
mother
corpse
answered
the
sexton
coldly
i
brought
you
hither
to
behold
it
but
you
have
anticipated
my
intentions
my
mother
shrieked
luke
dropping
upon
his
knees
by
the
body
and
seizing
one
of
its
chilly
hands
as
it
lay
upon
the
floor
with
the
face
upwards
the
sexton
took
the
candle
from
the
sconce
can
this
be
death
shouted
luke
impossible
oh
god
she
stirs
she
moves
the
light
quick
i
see
her
stir
this
is
dreadful
do
not
deceive
yourself
said
the
sexton
in
a
tone
which
betrayed
more
emotion
than
was
his
wont
is
the
bewilderment
of
fancy
she
will
never
stir
again
and
he
shaded
the
candle
with
his
hand
so
as
to
throw
the
light
full
upon
the
face
of
the
corpse
it
was
motionless
as
that
of
an
image
carved
in
stone
no
trace
of
corruption
was
visible
upon
the
rigid
yet
exquisite
tracery
of
its
features
a
profuse
cloud
of
raven
hair
escaped
from
its
swathements
in
the
fall
hung
like
a
dark
veil
over
the
bosom
and
person
of
the
dead
and
presented
a
startling
contrast
to
the
waxlike
hue
of
the
skin
and
the
pallid
cereclothes
flesh
still
adhered
to
the
hand
though
it
mouldered
into
dust
within
the
gripe
of
luke
as
he
pressed
the
fingers
to
his
lips
the
shroud
was
disposed
like
about
her
person
and
from
without
its
folds
a
few
withered
flowers
had
fallen
a
strong
aromatic
odor
of
a
pungent
nature
was
diffused
around
giving
evidence
that
the
art
by
which
the
ancient
egyptians
endeavored
to
rescue
their
kindred
from
decomposition
had
been
resorted
to
to
preserve
the
fleeting
charms
of
the
unfortunate
susan
bradley
a
pause
of
awful
silence
succeeded
broken
only
by
the
convulsive
respiration
of
luke
the
sexton
stood
by
apparently
an
indifferent
spectator
of
the
scene
of
horror
his
eye
wandered
from
the
dead
to
the
living
and
gleamed
with
a
peculiar
and
indefinable
expression
half
apathy
half
abstraction
for
one
single
instant
as
he
scrutinized
the
features
of
his
daughter
his
brow
contracted
by
anger
immediately
afterwards
was
elevated
in
scorn
but
otherwise
you
would
have
sought
in
vain
to
read
the
purport
of
that
cold
insensible
glance
which
dwelt
for
a
brief
space
on
the
face
of
the
mother
and
settled
eventually
upon
her
son
at
length
the
withered
flowers
attracted
his
attention
he
stooped
to
pick
up
one
of
them
faded
as
the
hand
that
gathered
ye
as
the
bosom
on
which
ye
were
strewn
he
murmured
no
sweet
smell
left
but
faugh
holding
the
dry
leaves
to
the
flame
of
the
candle
they
were
instantly
ignited
and
the
momentary
brilliance
played
like
a
smile
upon
the
features
of
the
dead
peter
observed
the
effect
such
was
thy
life
he
exclaimed
a
brief
bright
sparkle
followed
by
dark
utter
extinction
saying
which
he
flung
the
expiring
ashes
of
the
floweret
from
his
hand
skeleton
you
are
very
cold
i
fear
you
are
not
well
after
your
travel
ha
oh
horrible
let
her
have
lights
enough
what
witchcraft
doth
he
practise
that
he
hath
left
a
dead
hand
here
of
the
sexton
waning
candle
now
warned
him
of
the
progress
of
time
and
having
completed
his
arrangements
he
addressed
himself
to
luke
intimating
his
intention
of
departing
but
receiving
no
answer
and
remarking
no
signs
of
life
about
his
grandson
he
began
to
be
apprehensive
that
he
had
fallen
into
a
swoon
drawing
near
to
luke
he
took
him
gently
by
the
arm
thus
disturbed
luke
groaned
aloud
i
am
glad
to
find
you
can
breathe
if
it
be
only
after
that
melancholy
fashion
said
the
sexton
but
come
i
have
wasted
time
enough
already
you
must
indulge
your
grief
elsewhere
leave
me
sighed
luke
what
here
it
were
as
much
as
my
office
is
worth
you
can
return
some
other
night
but
go
you
must
now
at
least
if
you
take
on
thus
i
never
calculated
upon
a
scene
like
this
or
it
had
been
long
ere
i
brought
you
hither
so
come
away
yet
stay
but
first
lend
me
a
hand
to
replace
the
body
in
the
coffin
touch
it
not
exclaimed
luke
she
shall
not
rest
another
hour
within
these
accursed
walls
i
will
bear
her
hence
myself
and
sobbing
hysterically
he
relapsed
into
his
former
insensibility
poh
this
is
worse
than
midsummer
madness
said
peter
the
lad
is
crazed
with
grief
and
all
about
a
mother
who
has
been
years
in
her
grave
i
will
put
her
out
of
the
way
myself
saying
which
he
proceeded
as
noiselessly
as
possible
to
raise
the
corpse
in
his
arms
and
deposited
it
softly
within
its
former
tenement
carefully
as
he
executed
his
task
he
could
not
accomplish
it
without
occasioning
a
slight
accident
to
the
fragile
frame
insensible
as
he
was
luke
had
not
relinquished
the
hold
he
maintained
of
his
hand
and
when
peter
lifted
the
body
the
ligaments
connecting
the
hand
with
the
arm
were
suddenly
snapped
asunder
it
would
appear
afterwards
that
this
joint
had
been
tampered
with
and
partially
dislocated
without
however
entering
into
further
particulars
in
this
place
it
may
be
sufficient
to
observe
that
the
hand
detached
from
the
socket
at
the
wrist
remained
within
the
gripe
of
luke
while
ignorant
of
the
mischief
he
had
occasioned
the
sexton
continued
his
labors
unconsciously
until
the
noise
which
he
of
necessity
made
in
stamping
with
his
heel
upon
the
plank
recalled
his
grandson
to
sensibility
the
first
thing
that
the
latter
perceived
upon
collecting
his
faculties
were
the
skeleton
fingers
twined
within
his
own
what
have
you
done
with
the
body
why
have
you
left
this
with
me
demanded
he
it
was
not
my
intention
to
have
done
so
answered
the
sexton
suspending
his
occupation
i
have
just
made
fast
the
lid
but
it
is
easily
undone
you
had
better
restore
it
never
returned
luke
staring
at
the
bony
fragment
pshaw
of
what
advantage
is
a
dead
hand
is
an
unlucky
keepsake
and
will
lead
to
mischief
the
only
use
i
ever
heard
of
such
a
thing
being
turned
to
was
in
the
case
of
ben
who
was
hanged
in
irons
for
murder
on
hardchase
heath
on
the
york
road
and
whose
hand
was
cut
off
at
the
wrist
the
first
night
to
make
a
hand
of
glory
or
dead
candle
hast
never
heard
what
the
old
song
says
and
without
awaiting
his
grandson
response
peter
broke
into
the
following
wild
strain
the
hand
of
glory
from
the
corse
that
hangs
on
the
roadside
tree
a
murderer
corse
it
needs
must
be
sever
the
right
hand
carefully
sever
the
hand
that
the
deed
hath
done
ere
the
flesh
that
clings
to
the
bones
be
gone
in
its
dry
veins
must
blood
be
none
those
ghastly
fingers
white
and
cold
within
a
enfold
count
the
mystic
count
of
seven
name
the
governors
of
heaven
then
in
earthen
vessel
place
them
and
with
encase
them
bleach
them
in
the
noonday
sun
till
the
marrow
melt
and
run
till
the
flesh
is
pale
and
wan
as
a
cloud
as
an
unpolluted
shroud
next
within
their
chill
embrace
the
dead
man
awful
candle
place
of
murderer
fat
must
that
candle
be
you
may
scoop
it
beneath
the
roadside
tree
of
wax
and
of
lapland
sisame
its
wick
must
be
twisted
of
hair
of
the
dead
by
the
crow
and
her
brood
on
the
wild
waste
shed
wherever
that
terrible
light
shall
burn
vainly
the
sleeper
may
toss
and
turn
his
leaden
lids
shall
he
unclose
so
long
as
that
magical
taper
glows
life
and
treasures
shall
he
command
who
knoweth
the
charm
of
the
glorious
hand
but
of
black
cat
gall
let
him
aye
have
care
and
of
venomous
blood
beware
peace
thundered
luke
extending
his
mother
hand
towards
the
sexton
what
seest
thou
i
see
something
shine
hold
it
nigher
the
light
ha
that
is
strange
truly
how
came
that
ring
there
ask
of
sir
piers
ask
of
her
shouted
luke
with
a
wild
burst
of
exulting
laughter
ha
ha
ha
is
a
and
look
the
finger
is
bent
it
must
have
been
placed
upon
it
in
her
lifetime
there
is
no
deception
in
this
no
trickery
ha
it
would
seem
not
the
sinew
must
have
been
contracted
in
life
the
tendons
are
pulled
down
so
tightly
that
the
ring
could
not
be
withdrawn
without
breaking
the
finger
you
are
sure
that
coffin
contains
her
body
as
sure
as
i
am
that
this
carcass
is
my
own
the
hand
is
hers
can
any
doubt
exist
wherefore
should
it
it
was
broken
from
the
arm
by
accident
within
this
moment
i
noticed
not
the
occurrence
but
it
must
have
been
so
then
it
follows
that
she
was
wedded
and
i
am
not
illegitimate
for
your
own
sake
i
am
glad
of
it
my
heart
will
burst
oh
could
i
but
establish
the
fact
of
this
marriage
her
wrongs
would
be
indeed
avenged
listen
to
me
luke
said
the
sexton
solemnly
i
told
you
when
i
appointed
this
midnight
interview
i
had
a
secret
to
communicate
that
secret
is
now
revealed
that
secret
was
your
mother
marriage
and
it
was
known
to
you
during
her
lifetime
it
was
but
i
was
sworn
to
secrecy
you
have
proofs
then
i
have
nothing
beyond
sir
piers
word
and
he
is
silent
now
by
whom
was
the
ceremony
performed
by
a
romish
priest
a
jesuit
one
father
checkley
at
that
time
an
inmate
of
the
hall
for
sir
piers
though
he
afterwards
abjured
it
at
that
time
professed
the
catholic
faith
and
this
checkley
officiated
as
his
confessor
and
counsellor
as
the
partner
of
his
pleasures
and
the
prompter
of
his
iniquities
he
was
your
father
evil
genius
is
he
still
alive
i
know
not
after
your
mother
death
he
left
the
hall
i
have
said
he
was
a
jesuit
and
i
may
add
that
he
was
mixed
up
in
dark
political
intrigues
in
which
your
father
was
too
feeble
a
character
to
take
much
share
but
though
too
weak
to
guide
he
was
a
pliant
instrument
and
this
checkley
knew
he
moulded
him
according
to
his
wishes
i
can
not
tell
you
what
was
the
nature
of
their
plots
suffice
it
they
were
such
as
if
discovered
would
have
involved
your
father
in
ruin
he
was
saved
however
by
his
wife
and
her
reward
groaned
luke
was
death
replied
peter
coldly
what
jesuit
ever
forgave
a
wrong
real
or
imaginary
your
mother
i
ought
to
have
said
was
a
protestant
hence
there
was
a
difference
of
religious
opinion
the
worst
of
differences
that
can
exist
between
husband
and
wife
checkley
vowed
her
destruction
and
he
kept
his
vow
he
was
enamored
of
her
beauty
but
while
he
burnt
with
adulterous
desire
he
was
consumed
by
fiercest
hate
contending
and
yet
passions
as
you
may
have
reason
hereafter
to
discover
go
on
said
luke
grinding
his
teeth
i
have
done
returned
peter
from
that
hour
your
father
love
for
his
supposed
mistress
and
unacknowledged
wife
declined
and
with
his
waning
love
declined
her
health
i
will
not
waste
words
in
describing
the
catastrophe
that
awaited
her
union
it
will
be
enough
to
say
she
was
found
one
morning
a
corpse
within
her
bed
whatever
suspicions
were
attached
to
sir
piers
were
quieted
by
checkley
who
distributed
gold
largely
and
discreetly
the
body
was
embalmed
by
barbara
lovel
the
gipsy
queen
my
exclaimed
luke
in
a
tone
of
extreme
astonishment
ah
replied
peter
from
her
you
may
learn
all
particulars
you
have
now
seen
what
remains
of
your
mother
you
are
in
possession
of
the
secret
of
your
birth
the
path
is
before
you
and
if
you
would
arrive
at
honor
you
must
pursue
it
steadily
turning
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
opposition
you
will
meet
at
each
step
but
fresh
lights
may
be
thrown
upon
this
difficult
case
it
is
in
vain
to
hope
for
evidence
even
should
the
caitiff
priest
be
living
he
is
himself
too
deeply
implicated
ha
peter
stopped
for
at
this
moment
the
flame
of
the
candle
suddenly
expired
and
the
speakers
were
left
in
total
darkness
something
like
a
groan
followed
the
conclusion
of
the
sexton
discourse
it
was
evident
that
it
proceeded
not
from
his
grandson
as
an
exclamation
burst
from
him
at
the
same
instant
luke
stretched
out
his
arm
a
cold
hand
seemed
to
press
against
his
own
communicating
a
chill
like
death
to
his
frame
who
is
between
us
he
ejaculated
the
devil
cried
the
sexton
leaping
from
the
with
an
agility
that
did
him
honor
is
aught
between
us
i
will
discharge
my
gun
its
flash
will
light
us
do
so
hastily
rejoined
peter
but
not
in
this
direction
get
behind
me
cried
luke
and
he
pulled
the
trigger
a
blaze
of
vivid
light
illumined
the
darkness
still
nothing
was
visible
save
the
warrior
figure
which
was
seen
for
a
moment
and
then
vanished
like
a
ghost
the
rattled
against
the
further
end
of
the
vault
let
us
go
hence
ejaculated
the
sexton
who
had
rushed
to
the
door
and
thrown
it
wide
open
mole
mole
cried
he
and
the
dog
sprang
after
him
i
could
have
sworn
i
felt
something
said
luke
whence
issued
that
groan
ask
not
whence
replied
peter
reach
me
my
mattock
and
spade
and
the
lantern
they
are
behind
you
and
stay
it
were
better
to
bring
away
the
bottle
take
them
and
leave
me
here
alone
in
the
vault
no
no
luke
i
have
not
told
you
half
i
know
concerning
that
mystic
statue
it
is
said
to
move
to
walk
to
raise
its
axe
be
warned
i
pray
leave
me
or
abide
if
you
will
my
coming
in
the
church
if
there
is
aught
that
may
be
revealed
to
my
ear
alone
i
will
not
shrink
from
it
though
the
dead
themselves
should
arise
to
proclaim
the
mystery
it
may
be
but
go
there
are
your
tools
and
he
shut
the
door
with
a
jar
that
shook
the
sexton
frame
peter
after
some
muttered
murmurings
at
the
hardihood
and
madness
as
he
termed
it
of
his
grandson
disposed
his
lanky
limbs
to
repose
upon
a
cushioned
bench
without
the
communion
railing
as
the
pale
moonlight
fell
upon
his
gaunt
and
cadaverous
visage
he
looked
like
some
unholy
thing
suddenly
annihilated
by
the
presiding
influence
of
that
sacred
spot
mole
crouched
himself
in
a
ring
at
his
master
feet
peter
had
not
dozed
many
minutes
when
he
was
aroused
by
luke
return
the
latter
was
very
pale
and
the
damp
stood
in
big
drops
upon
his
brow
have
you
made
fast
the
door
inquired
the
sexton
here
is
the
key
what
have
you
seen
he
next
demanded
luke
made
no
answer
at
that
moment
the
church
clock
struck
two
breaking
the
stillness
with
an
iron
clang
luke
raised
his
eyes
a
ray
of
moonlight
streaming
obliquely
through
the
painted
window
fell
upon
the
gilt
lettering
of
a
black
mural
entablature
the
lower
part
of
the
inscription
was
in
the
shade
but
the
emblazonment
and
the
words
orate
pro
anima
reginaldi
rookwood
equitis
aurati
were
clear
and
distinct
luke
trembled
he
knew
not
why
as
the
sexton
pointed
to
it
you
have
heard
of
the
handwriting
upon
the
wall
said
peter
look
there
kingdom
hath
been
taken
from
him
ha
ha
listen
to
me
of
all
thy
monster
race
of
all
the
race
of
rookwood
i
should
say
no
demon
ever
stalked
the
earth
more
terrible
than
him
whose
tablet
you
now
behold
by
him
a
brother
was
betrayed
by
him
a
brother
wife
was
dishonored
love
honor
friendship
were
with
him
as
words
he
regarded
no
ties
he
defied
and
set
at
naught
all
human
laws
and
obligations
and
yet
he
was
religious
or
esteemed
so
received
the
and
died
full
of
years
and
honors
hugging
salvation
to
his
sinful
heart
and
after
death
he
has
yon
lying
epitaph
to
record
his
virtues
virtues
ha
ha
ask
him
who
preaches
to
the
kneeling
throng
gathering
within
this
holy
place
what
shall
be
the
murderer
portion
and
he
will
answer
and
yet
sir
reginald
was
the
awful
question
where
is
thy
brother
broke
not
his
tranquil
slumbers
luke
i
have
told
you
much
but
not
all
you
know
not
as
yet
nor
shall
you
know
your
destiny
but
you
shall
be
the
avenger
of
infamy
and
blood
i
have
a
sacred
charge
committed
to
my
keeping
which
hereafter
i
may
delegate
to
you
you
be
sir
luke
rookwood
but
the
conditions
must
be
mine
to
propose
no
more
said
luke
my
brain
reels
i
am
faint
let
us
quit
this
place
and
get
into
the
fresh
air
and
striding
past
his
grandsire
he
traversed
the
aisles
with
hasty
steps
peter
was
not
slow
to
follow
the
key
was
applied
and
they
emerged
into
the
churchyard
the
grassy
mounds
were
bathed
in
the
moonbeams
and
the
two
throwing
their
black
jagged
shadows
over
the
grave
hills
looked
like
evil
spirits
brooding
over
the
repose
of
the
righteous
the
sexton
noticed
the
deathly
paleness
of
luke
countenance
but
he
fancied
it
might
proceed
from
the
tinge
of
the
sallow
moonlight
i
will
be
with
you
at
your
cottage
ere
daybreak
said
luke
and
turning
an
angle
of
the
church
he
disappeared
from
view
so
exclaimed
peter
gazing
after
him
the
train
is
laid
the
spark
has
been
applied
the
explosion
will
soon
follow
the
hour
is
fast
approaching
when
i
shall

stimulant
in
a
short
time
i
may
not
require
it
draining
the
bottle
to
the
last
drop
he
flung
it
from
him
and
commenced
chanting
in
a
high
key
and
cracked
voice
a
wild
ditty
the
words
of
which
ran
as

the

quitted
the
churchyard
peter
had
not
been
gone
many
seconds
when
a
dark
figure
muffled
in
a
wide
black
mantle
emerged
from
among
the
tombs
surrounding
the
church
gazed
after
him
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
with
a
menacing
gesture
retreated
behind
the
ivied
buttresses
of
the
gray
old
pile
ralph
hearest

there
i

you
have
stolen
my
deer
devil
of
luke
first
impulse
had
been
to
free
himself
from
the
restraint
imposed
by
his
grandsire
society
he
longed
to
commune
with
himself
leaping
the
small
which
defended
the
churchyard
from
a
deep
green
lane
he
hurried
along
in
a
direction
contrary
to
that
taken
by
the
sexton
making
the
best
of
his
way
until
he
arrived
at
a
gap
in
the
hazel
hedge
which
overhung
the
road
heedless
of
the
impediments
thrown
in
his
way
by
the
undergrowth
of
a
rough
ring
fence
he
struck
through
the
opening
that
presented
itself
and
climbing
over
the
paling
trod
presently
upon
the
elastic
sward
of
rookwood
park
a
few
minutes
rapid
walking
brought
him
to
the
summit
of
a
rising
ground
crowned
with
aged
oaks
and
as
he
passed
beneath
their
broad
shadows
his
troubled
spirit
soothed
by
the
quietude
of
the
scene
in
part
resumed
its
serenity
luke
yielded
to
the
gentle
influence
of
the
time
and
hour
the
stillness
of
the
spot
allayed
the
irritation
of
his
frame
and
the
dewy
chillness
cooled
the
fever
of
his
brow
leaning
for
support
against
the
gnarled
trunk
of
one
of
the
trees
he
gave
himself
up
to
contemplation
the
events
of
the
last
hour
of
his
whole
existence
passed
in
rapid
review
before
him
the
thought
of
the
wayward
vagabond
life
he
had
led
of
the
wild
adventures
of
his
youth
of
all
he
had
been
of
all
he
had
of
all
he
had
endured
crowded
his
mind
and
then
like
the
passing
of
a
cloud
flitting
across
the
autumnal
moon
and
occasionally
obscuring
the
smiling
landscape
before
him
his
soul
was
shadowed
by
the
remembrance
of
the
awful
revelations
of
the
last
hour
and
the
fearful
knowledge
he
had
acquired
of
his
mother
fate
of
his
father
guilt
the
eminence
on
which
he
stood
was
one
of
the
highest
points
of
the
park
and
commanded
a
view
of
the
hall
which
might
be
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
discernible
through
a
broken
vista
of
trees
its
whitened
walls
glimmering
in
the
moonlight
and
its
tall
chimney
spiring
far
from
out
the
round
masses
of
wood
in
which
it
lay
embosomed
the
ground
gradually
sloped
in
that
direction
occasionally
rising
into
swells
studded
with
magnificent
timber
dipping
into
smooth
dells
or
stretching
out
into
level
glades
until
it
suddenly
sank
into
a
deep
declivity
that
formed
an
effectual
division
without
the
intervention
of
a
or
other
barrier
between
the
chase
and
the
a
slender
stream
strayed
through
this
ravine
having
found
its
way
thither
from
a
small
reservoir
hidden
in
the
higher
plantations
to
the
left
and
further
on
in
the
open
ground
and
in
a
line
with
the
hall
though
of
course
much
below
the
level
of
the
building
assisted
by
many
local
springs
and
restrained
by
a
variety
of
natural
and
artificial
embankments
this
brook
spread
out
into
an
expansive
sheet
of
water
crossed
by
a
rustic
bridge
the
only
communication
between
the
parks
the
pool
found
its
outlet
into
the
meads
below
and
even
at
that
distance
and
in
that
still
hour
you
might
almost
catch
the
sound
of
the
brawling
waters
as
they
dashed
down
the
weir
in
a
foaming
cascade
while
far
away
in
the
spreading
valley
the
serpentine
meanderings
of
the
slender
current
might
be
traced
glittering
like
silvery
threads
in
the
moonshine
the
mild
beams
of
the
queen
of
night
then
in
her
meridian
trembled
upon
the
topmost
branches
of
the
tall
timber
quivering
like
diamond
spray
upon
the
outer
foliage
and
penetrating
through
the
interstices
of
the
trees
fell
upon
the
light
wreaths
of
vapor
then
beginning
to
arise
from
the
surface
of
the
pool
steeping
them
in
misty
splendor
and
lending
to
this
part
of
the
picture
a
character
of
dreamy
and
unearthly
beauty
all
else
was
in
unison
no
sound
interrupted
the
silence
of
solitude
except
the
hooting
of
a
large
gray
owl
that
scared
at
his
approach
or
in
search
of
prey
winged
its
spectral
flight
in
continuous
and
mazy
circles
round
his
head
uttering
at
each
wheel
its
startling
whoop
or
a
deep
distant
bay
that
ever
and
anon
boomed
upon
the
ear
proceeding
from
a
pack
of
hounds
kennelled
in
a
shed
adjoining
the
pool
before
mentioned
but
which
was
shrouded
from
view
by
the
rising
mist
no
living
objects
presented
themselves
save
a
herd
of
deer
crouched
in
a
covert
of
brown
fern
beneath
the
shadow
of
a
few
stunted
trees
immediately
below
the
point
of
land
on
which
luke
stood
and
although
their
branching
antlers
could
scarcely
be
detected
from
the
ramifications
of
the
wood
itself
they
escaped
not
his
practised
ken
how
often
murmured
luke
in
years
gone
by
have
i
traversed
these
moonlit
glades
and
wandered
amidst
these
woodlands
on
nights
heavenly
as
this
ay
and
to
some
purpose
as
yon
thinned
herd
might
testify
every
dingle
every
dell
every
rising
brow
every
bosky
vale
and
shelving
covert
have
been
as
familiar
to
my
track
as
to
that
of
the
fleetest
and
freest
of
their
number
scarce
a
tree
amidst
the
thickest
of
yon
outstretching
forest
with
which
i
can
not
claim
acquaintance
is
long
since
i
have
seen
them
by
heavens
is
beautiful
and
it
is
all
my
own
can
i
forget
that
it
was
here
i
first
emancipated
myself
from
thraldom
can
i
forget
the
boundless
feeling
of
delight
that
danced
within
my
veins
when
i
first
threw
off
the
yoke
of
servitude
and
roved
unshackled
unrestrained
amidst
these
woods
the
wild
intoxicating
bliss
still
tingles
to
my
heart
and
they
are
all
my
own
my
own
softly
what
have
we
there
luke
attention
was
arrested
by
an
object
which
could
not
fail
to
interest
him
sportsman
as
he
was
a
snorting
bray
was
heard
and
a
lordly
stag
stalked
slowly
and
majestically
from
out
the
copse
luke
watched
the
actions
of
the
noble
animal
with
great
interest
drawing
back
into
the
shade
a
hundred
yards
or
thereabouts
might
be
between
him
and
the
buck
it
was
within
range
of
ball
luke
mechanically
grasped
his
gun
yet
his
hand
had
scarcely
raised
the
piece
half
way
to
his
shoulder
when
he
dropped
it
again
to
its
rest
what
am
i
about
to
do
he
mentally
ejaculated
why
for
mere
pastime
should
i
take
away
yon
noble
creature
life
when
his
carcass
would
be
utterly
useless
to
me
yet
such
is
the
force
of
habit
that
i
can
scarce
resist
the
impulse
that
tempted
me
to
fire
and
i
have
known
the
time
and
that
not
long
since
when
i
should
have
shown
no
such
unconscious
of
the
danger
it
had
escaped
the
animal
moved
forward
with
the
same
stately
step
suddenly
it
stopped
with
ears
pricked
as
if
some
sound
had
smote
them
at
that
instant
the
click
of
a
was
heard
at
a
little
distance
to
the
right
the
piece
had
missed
fire
an
instantaneous
report
from
another
gun
succeeded
and
with
a
bound
high
in
air
the
buck
fell
upon
his
back
struggling
in
the
agonies
of
death
luke
had
at
once
divined
the
cause
he
was
aware
that
poachers
were
at
hand
he
fancied
that
he
knew
the
parties
nor
was
he
deceived
in
his
conjecture
two
figures
issued
instantly
from
a
covert
on
the
right
and
making
to
the
spot
the
first
who
reached
it
put
an
end
to
the
struggles
by
plunging
a
knife
into
its
throat
the
affrighted
herd
took
to
their
heels
and
were
seen
darting
swiftly
down
the
chase
one
of
the
twain
meantime
was
occupied
in
feeling
for
the
deer
fat
when
he
was
approached
by
the
other
who
pointed
in
the
direction
of
the
house
the
former
raised
himself
from
his
kneeling
posture
and
both
appeared
to
listen
attentively
luke
fancied
he
heard
a
slight
sound
in
the
distance
whatever
the
noise
proceeded
from
it
was
evident
the
were
alarmed
they
laid
hold
of
the
buck
and
dragging
it
along
concealed
the
carcass
among
the
tall
fern
they
then
retreated
halting
for
an
instant
to
deliberate
within
a
few
yards
of
luke
who
was
concealed
from
their
view
by
the
trunk
of
the
tree
behind
which
he
had
ensconced
his
person
they
were
so
near
that
he
lost
not
a
word
of
their
muttered
conference
the
game
spoiled
this
time
rob
rust
any
how
growled
one
in
an
angry
tone
the
hawks
are
upon
us
and
we
must
leave
this
brave
buck
to
take
care
of
himself
curse
him
who
thought
of
hugh
quitting
his
bed
respect
for
his
late
master
might
have
kept
him
quiet
the
night
before
the
funeral
but
look
out
lad
dost
see
ay
thanks
to
old
oliver
yonder
they
are
returned
the
other
one
two
three
and
a
muzzled
bouser
to
boot
there
hugh
at
the
head
on
shall
we
stand
and
show
fight
i
have
half
a
mind
for
it
no
no
replied
the
first
speaker
that
will
never
do
rob
no
fighting
why
run
the
risk
of
being
grabb
for
a
haunch
of
venison
had
luke
bradley
or
jack
palmer
been
with
us
it
might
have
been
another
affair
as
it
is
it
wo
pay
besides
we
that
to
do
at
the
hall
night
that
may
make
men
of
us
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
we
pledged
ourselves
to
jack
palmer
and
we
ca
be
off
in
honor
it
wo
do
to
be
snabbled
in
the
nick
of
it
so
let
make
for
the
prad
in
the
lane
keep
in
the
shade
as
much
as
you
can
come
along
my
hearty
and
away
the
two
worthies
scampered
down
the
shall
i
follow
thought
luke
and
run
the
risk
of
falling
into
the
keeper
hand
just
at
this
crisis
too
no
but
if
i
am
found
here
i
shall
be
taken
for
one
of
the
gang
something
must
be
done
ha
devil
take
them
here
they
are
already
further
time
was
not
allowed
him
for
reflection
a
hoarse
baying
was
heard
followed
by
a
loud
cry
from
the
keepers
the
dog
had
scented
out
the
game
and
as
secrecy
was
no
longer
necessary
his
muzzle
had
been
removed
to
rush
forth
now
were
certain
betrayal
to
remain
was
almost
equally
assured
detection
and
doubting
whether
he
should
obtain
credence
if
he
delivered
himself
over
in
that
garb
and
armed
luke
at
once
rejected
the
idea
just
then
it
flashed
across
his
recollection
that
his
gun
had
remained
unloaded
and
he
applied
himself
eagerly
to
repair
this
negligence
when
he
heard
the
dog
in
full
cry
making
swiftly
in
his
direction
he
threw
himself
upon
the
ground
where
the
fern
was
thickest
but
this
seemed
insufficient
to
baffle
the
sagacity
of
the
hound
the
animal
had
got
his
scent
and
was
baying
close
at
hand
the
keepers
were
drawing
nigh
luke
gave
himself
up
for
lost
the
dog
however
stopped
where
the
two
poachers
had
halted
and
was
there
completely
at
fault
snuffing
the
ground
he
bayed
wheeled
round
and
then
set
off
with
renewed
barking
upon
their
track
hugh
badger
and
his
comrades
loitered
an
instant
at
the
same
place
looked
warily
round
and
then
as
luke
conjectured
followed
the
course
taken
by
the
hound
swift
as
thought
luke
arose
and
keeping
as
much
as
possible
under
cover
of
the
trees
started
in
a
cross
line
for
the
lane
rapid
as
was
his
flight
it
was
not
without
a
witness
one
of
the
assistants
who
had
lagged
behind
gave
the
in
a
loud
voice
luke
pressed
forward
with
redoubled
energy
endeavoring
to
gain
the
shelter
of
the
plantation
and
this
he
could
readily
have
accomplished
had
no
impediment
been
in
his
way
but
his
rage
and
vexation
were
boundless
when
he
heard
the
keeper
cry
echoed
by
shouts
immediately
below
him
and
the
tongue
of
the
hound
resounding
in
the
hollow
he
turned
sharply
round
steering
a
middle
course
and
still
aiming
at
the
fence
it
was
evident
from
the
cheers
of
his
pursuers
that
he
was
in
full
view
and
he
heard
them
encouraging
and
directing
the
dog
luke
had
gained
the
park
palings
along
which
he
rushed
in
the
vain
quest
of
some
practicable
point
of
egress
for
the
fence
was
higher
in
this
part
of
the
park
than
elsewhere
owing
to
the
inequality
of
the
ground
he
had
cast
away
his
gun
as
useless
but
even
without
that
incumbrance
he
dared
not
hazard
the
delay
of
climbing
the
palings
at
this
juncture
a
deep
breathing
was
heard
close
behind
him
he
threw
a
glance
over
his
shoulder
within
a
few
yards
was
a
ferocious
bloodhound
with
whose
savage
nature
luke
was
well
acquainted
the
breed
some
of
which
he
had
already
seen
having
been
maintained
at
the
hall
ever
since
the
days
of
grim
old
sir
ranulph
the
eyes
of
the
hound
were
glaring
his
tongue
was
hanging
out
and
a
row
of
keen
white
fangs
was
displayed
like
the
teeth
of
a
shark
there
was
a
growl
a
leap
and
the
dog
was
close
upon
him
luke
courage
was
undoubted
but
his
heart
failed
him
as
he
heard
the
roar
of
the
remorseless
brute
and
felt
that
he
could
not
avoid
an
encounter
with
the
animal
his
resolution
was
instantly
taken
he
stopped
short
with
such
suddenness
that
the
dog
when
in
the
act
of
springing
flew
past
him
with
great
violence
and
the
time
momentary
as
it
was
occupied
by
the
animal
in
recovering
himself
enabled
luke
to
drop
on
his
knee
and
to
place
one
arm
like
a
buckler
before
his
face
while
he
held
the
other
in
readiness
to
grapple
his
adversary
uttering
a
fierce
yell
the
hound
returned
to
the
charge
darting
at
luke
who
received
the
assault
without
flinching
and
in
spite
of
a
severe
laceration
of
the
arm
he
seized
his
foe
by
the
throat
and
hurling
him
upon
the
ground
jumped
with
all
his
force
upon
his
belly
there
was
a
yell
of
agony
the
contest
was
ended
and
luke
was
at
liberty
to
pursue
his
flight
unmolested
brief
as
had
been
the
interval
required
for
this
combat
it
had
been
sufficient
to
bring
the
pursuers
within
sight
of
the
fugitive
hugh
badger
who
from
the
acclivity
had
witnessed
the
fate
of
his
favorite
with
a
loud
oath
discharged
the
contents
of
his
gun
at
the
head
of
its
destroyer
it
was
fortunate
for
luke
that
at
this
instant
he
stumbled
over
the
root
of
a
tree
the
shot
rattled
in
the
leaves
as
he
fell
and
the
keeper
concluding
that
he
had
at
least
winged
his
bird
descended
more
leisurely
towards
him
as
he
lay
upon
the
ground
luke
felt
that
he
was
wounded
whether
by
the
teeth
of
the
dog
from
a
stray
shot
or
from
bruises
inflicted
by
the
fall
he
could
not
determine
but
smarting
with
pain
he
resolved
to
wreak
his
vengeance
upon
the
first
person
who
approached
him
he
vowed
not
to
be
taken
with
life
to
strangle
any
who
should
lay
hands
upon
him
at
that
moment
he
felt
a
pressure
at
his
breast
it
was
the
dead
hand
of
his
mother
luke
shuddered
the
fire
of
revenge
was
quenched
he
mentally
cancelled
his
rash
oath
yet
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
surrender
at
discretion
and
without
further
effort
the
keeper
and
his
assistants
were
approaching
the
spot
where
he
lay
and
searching
for
his
body
hugh
badger
was
foremost
and
within
a
yard
of
him
confound
the
rascal
cried
hugh
he
not
half
killed
he
seems
to
breathe
the
words
were
scarcely
out
of
his
mouth
ere
the
speaker
was
dashed
backwards
and
lay
sprawling
upon
the
sod
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
as
an
indian
chief
might
rush
upon
his
foes
luke
arose
dashing
himself
with
great
violence
against
hugh
who
happened
to
stand
in
his
way
and
before
the
startled
assistants
who
were
either
too
much
taken
by
surprise
or
unwilling
to
draw
a
trigger
could
in
any
way
lay
hands
upon
him
exerting
all
the
remarkable
activity
which
he
possessed
he
caught
hold
of
a
projecting
branch
of
a
tree
and
swung
himself
at
a
single
bound
fairly
over
the
paling
hugh
badger
was
shortly
on
his
legs
swearing
lustily
at
his
defeat
directing
his
men
to
skirt
alongside
the
fence
and
make
for
a
particular
part
of
the
plantation
which
he
named
and
snatching
a
loaded
from
one
of
them
he
clambered
over
the
pales
and
guided
by
the
crashing
branches
and
other
sounds
conveyed
to
his
quick
ear
he
was
speedily
upon
luke
track
the
plantation
through
which
the
chase
now
took
place
was
not
as
might
be
supposed
a
continuation
of
the
ring
fence
which
luke
had
originally
crossed
on
his
entrance
into
the
park
though
girded
by
the
same
line
of
paling
but
in
reality
a
close
pheasant
preserve
occupying
the
banks
of
a
ravine
which
after
a
deep
and
tortuous
course
terminated
in
the
declivity
heretofore
described
as
forming
the
park
boundary
luke
plunged
into
the
heart
of
this
defile
fighting
his
way
downwards
in
the
direction
of
the
brook
his
progress
was
impeded
by
a
thick
undergrowth
of
brier
and
other
matted
vegetation
as
well
as
by
the
entanglements
thrown
in
his
way
by
the
taller
bushes
of
thorn
and
hazel
the
entwined
and
elastic
branches
of
which
in
their
recoil
galled
and
fretted
him
by
inflicting
smart
blows
on
his
face
and
hands
this
was
a
hardship
he
usually
little
regarded
but
upon
the
present
occasion
it
had
the
effect
by
irritating
his
temper
of
increasing
the
thirst
of
vengeance
raging
in
his
bosom
through
the
depths
of
the
ravine
welled
the
shallow
stream
before
alluded
to
and
hugh
badger
had
no
sooner
reached
its
sedgy
margin
than
he
lost
all
trace
of
the
fugitive
he
looked
cautiously
round
listened
intently
and
inclined
his
ear
to
catch
the
faintest
echo
all
was
still
not
a
branch
shook
not
a
leaf
rustled
hugh
looked
aghast
he
had
made
sure
of
getting
a
glimpse
and
perhaps
a
stray
shot
at
the
poaching
rascal
as
he
termed
him
in
the
open
space
which
he
was
sure
the
fellow
was
aiming
to
reach
and
now
all
at
once
he
had
disappeared
like
a
or
a
boggart
of
the
clough
however
he
could
not
be
far
off
and
hugh
endeavored
to
obtain
some
clue
to
guide
him
in
his
quest
he
was
not
long
in
detecting
recent
marks
deeply
indented
in
the
mud
on
the
opposite
bank
hugh
leaped
thither
at
once
further
on
some
rushes
were
trodden
down
and
there
were
other
indications
of
the
course
the
fugitive
had
taken
hark
forward
shouted
hugh
in
the
joy
of
his
heart
at
this
discovery
and
like
a
dog
he
followed
up
with
alacrity
the
scent
he
had
opened
the
brook
presented
still
fewer
impediments
to
expedition
than
the
thick
copse
and
the
keeper
pursued
the
wanderings
of
the
petty
current
occasionally
splashing
into
the
stream
here
and
there
the
print
of
a
foot
on
the
soil
satisfied
him
he
was
in
the
right
path
at
length
he
became
aware
from
the
crumbling
soil
that
the
object
of
his
pursuit
had
scaled
the
bank
and
he
forthwith
moderated
his
pace
halting
he
perceived
what
he
took
to
be
a
face
peeping
at
him
from
behind
a
knot
of
alders
that
overhung
the
steep
and
shelving
bank
immediately
above
him
his
gun
was
instantly
at
his
shoulder
come
down
you
infernal
scoundrel
cried
hugh
or
blow
you
to
shivers
no
answer
was
returned
expostulation
was
vain
and
fearful
of
placing
himself
at
a
disadvantage
if
he
attempted
to
scale
the
bank
hugh
fired
without
further
parley
the
sharp
discharge
rolled
in
echoes
down
the
ravine
and
a
pheasant
scared
by
the
sound
answered
the
challenge
from
a
neighboring
tree
hugh
was
an
unerring
marksman
and
on
this
occasion
his
aim
had
been
steadily
taken
the
result
was
not
precisely
such
as
he
had
anticipated
a
fur
cap
shaken
by
the
shot
from
the
bough
on
which
it
hung
came
rolling
down
the
bank
proclaiming
the
that
had
been
practised
upon
the
keeper
little
time
was
allowed
him
for
reflection
before
he
could
reload
he
felt
himself
collared
by
the
iron
arm
of
luke
hugh
badger
was
a
man
of
great
personal
strength
with
a
prodigious
width
of
chest
and
a
frame
like
a
hercules
and
energetic
as
was
luke
assault
he
maintained
his
ground
without
flinching
the
struggle
was
desperate
luke
was
of
slighter
proportion
though
exceeding
the
keeper
in
stature
by
the
head
and
shoulders
this
superiority
availed
him
little
it
was
rather
a
disadvantage
in
the
conflict
that
ensued
the
gripe
fastened
upon
hugh
throat
was
like
that
of
a
clenched
vice
but
luke
might
as
well
have
grappled
the
neck
of
a
bull
as
that
of
the
stalwart
keeper
defending
himself
with
his
hobnail
boots
with
which
he
inflicted
several
severe
blows
upon
luke
shins
and
struggling
vehemently
hugh
succeeded
in
extricating
himself
from
his
throttling
grasp
he
then
closed
with
his
foe
and
they
were
locked
together
like
a
couple
of
bears
at
play
straining
tugging
and
practising
every
sleight
and
stratagem
coming
within
the
scope
of
feet
knees
and
thighs
now
tripping
now
jerking
now
advancing
now
retreating
they
continued
the
strife
but
all
with
doubtful
result
victory
at
length
seemed
to
declare
itself
in
favor
of
the
sturdy
keeper
aware
of
his
strength
it
was
luke
chief
endeavor
to
keep
his
lower
limbs
disengaged
and
to
trust
more
to
skill
than
force
for
ultimate
success
to
prevent
this
was
hugh
grand
object
guarding
himself
against
every
feint
he
ultimately
succeeded
in
firmly
grappling
his
agile
assailant
luke
spine
was
almost
broken
by
the
shock
when
he
suddenly
gave
way
and
without
losing
his
balance
drew
his
adversary
forward
kicking
his
right
leg
from
under
him
with
a
crash
like
that
of
an
uprooted
oak
hugh
fell
with
his
foe
upon
him
into
the
bed
of
the
rivulet
not
a
word
had
been
spoken
during
the
conflict
a
convulsive
groan
burst
from
hugh
hardy
breast
his
hand
sought
his
girdle
but
in
vain
his
knife
was
gone
gazing
upwards
his
dancing
vision
encountered
the
glimmer
of
the
blade
the
weapon
had
dropped
from
its
case
in
the
fall
luke
brandished
it
before
his
eyes
villain
gasped
hugh
ineffectually
struggling
to
free
himself
you
will
not
murder
me
and
his
efforts
to
release
himself
became
desperate
no
answered
luke
flinging
the
uplifted
knife
into
the
brook
i
will
not
do
though
thou
hast
twice
aimed
at
my
life
but
i
will
silence
thee
at
all
events
saying
which
he
dealt
the
keeper
a
blow
on
the
head
that
terminated
all
further
resistance
on
his
part
leaving
the
inert
mass
to
choke
up
the
current
with
whose
waters
the
blood
oozing
from
the
wound
began
to
commingle
luke
prepared
to
depart
his
perils
were
not
yet
past
guided
by
the
firing
the
report
of
which
alarmed
them
the
keeper
assistants
hastened
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
presenting
themselves
directly
in
the
path
luke
was
about
to
take
he
had
either
to
retrace
his
steps
or
face
a
double
enemy
his
election
was
made
at
once
he
turned
and
fled
for
an
instant
the
men
tarried
with
their
bleeding
companion
they
then
dragged
him
from
the
brook
and
with
loud
oaths
followed
in
pursuit
threading
for
a
second
time
the
bosky
labyrinth
luke
sought
the
source
of
the
stream
this
was
precisely
the
course
his
enemies
would
have
desired
him
to
pursue
and
when
they
beheld
him
take
it
they
felt
confident
of
his
capture
the
sides
of
the
hollow
became
more
and
more
abrupt
as
they
advanced
though
they
were
less
covered
with
brushwood
the
fugitive
made
no
attempt
to
climb
the
bank
but
still
pressed
forward
the
road
was
tortuous
and
wound
round
a
jutting
point
of
rock
now
he
was
a
fair
mark
no
he
had
swept
swiftly
by
and
was
out
of
sight
before
a
gun
could
be
raised
they
reached
the
same
point
he
was
still
before
them
but
his
race
was
nearly
run
steep
slippery
rocks
shelving
down
to
the
edges
of
a
small
deep
pool
of
water
the
source
of
the
stream
formed
an
apparently
insurmountable
barrier
in
that
direction
rooted
heaven
knows
how
in
some
reft
or
fissure
of
the
rock
grew
a
wild
ash
throwing
out
a
few
boughs
over
the
solitary
pool
this
was
all
the
support
luke
could
hope
for
should
he
attempt
to
scale
the
rock
the
rock
was
sheer
the
pool
deep
yet
still
he
hurried
on
he
reached
the
muddy
embankment
mounted
its
sides
and
seemed
to
hesitate
the
keepers
were
now
within
a
hundred
yards
of
him
both
guns
were
discharged
and
sudden
as
the
reports
with
a
dead
splashless
plunge
like
a
diving
otter
the
fugitive
dropped
into
the
water
the
pursuers
were
at
the
brink
they
gazed
at
the
pool
a
few
bubbles
floated
upon
its
surface
and
burst
the
water
was
slightly
discolored
with
sand
no
ruddier
stain
crimsoned
the
tide
no
figure
rested
on
the
naked
rock
no
hand
clung
to
the
motionless
tree
devil
take
the
rascal
growled
one
i
hope
he
har
escaped
us
arter
all
noa
noa
he
be
fast
enough
never
fear
rejoined
the
other
sticking
like
a
snig
at
the
bottom
o
the
pond
and
dang
him
he
deserves
it
for
he
slipped
out
of
our
fingers
like
a
snig
often
enough
but
come
let
be
stumping
and
give
poor
hugh
badger
a
helping
hand
whereupon
they
returned
to
the
assistance
of
the
wounded
and
discomfited
keeper
i
am
right
against
my
house
seat
of
my
ancestors
rookwood
place
was
a
fine
old
irregular
pile
of
considerable
size
presenting
a
rich
picturesque
outline
with
its
innumerable
its
fantastical
coigns
and
tall
crest
of
twisted
chimneys
there
was
no
uniformity
of
style
about
the
building
yet
the
general
effect
was
pleasing
and
beautiful
its
very
irregularity
constituted
a
charm
nothing
except
convenience
had
been
consulted
in
its
construction
additions
had
from
time
to
time
been
made
to
it
but
everything
dropped
into
its
proper
place
and
without
apparent
effort
or
design
grew
into
an
ornament
and
heightened
the
beauty
of
the
whole
it
was
in
short
one
of
those
glorious
manorial
houses
that
sometimes
unexpectedly
greet
us
in
our
wanderings
and
gladden
us
like
the
discovery
of
a
hidden
treasure
some
such
ancestral
hall
we
have
occasionally
encountered
in
quarters
in
our
native
county
of
lancaster
or
in
its
smiling
sister
shire
and
never
without
feelings
of
intense
delight
rejoicing
to
behold
the
freshness
of
its
antiquity
and
the
greenness
of
its
old
age
for
be
it
observed
in
passing
a
cheshire
or
lancashire
hall
though
it
be
with
its
often
renovated
black
and
white
squares
fancifully
filled
up
with
trefoils
and
quatrefoils
rosettes
and
other
figures
seems
to
bear
its
years
so
lightly
that
its
age
so
far
from
detracting
from
its
beauty
only
lends
it
a
grace
and
the
same
mansion
to
all
outward
appearance
fresh
and
perfect
as
it
existed
in
the
days
of
good
queen
bess
may
be
seen
in
admirable
preservation
in
the
days
of
the
youthful
victoria
such
is
bramall
such
moreton
and
many
another
we
might
instance
the
former
of
these
houses
may
perhaps
be
instanced
as
the
best
specimen
of
its
class
and
its
class
in
our
opinion
the
best
to
be
met
with
in
cheshire
considered
with
reference
either
to
the
finished
decoration
of
its
exterior
rich
in
the
chequered
coloring
we
have
alluded
to
preserved
with
a
care
and
neatness
almost
dutch
or
to
the
consistent
taste
exhibited
by
its
possessor
to
the
restoration
and
maintenance
of
all
its
original
and
truly
national
beauty
within
doors
as
an
illustration
of
old
english
hospitality
that
real
hearty
hospitality
for
which
the
squirearchy
of
this
country
was
once
so
famous
ah
why
have
they
bartered
it
for
other
customs
less
substantially
it
may
be
mentioned
that
a
road
conducted
the
passenger
directly
through
the
great
hall
of
this
house
literally
of
entertainment
where
if
he
listed
strong
ale
and
other
refreshments
awaited
his
acceptance
and
courted
his
stay
well
might
old
king
the
cheshire
historian
in
the
pride
of
his
honest
heart
exclaim
know
divers
men
who
are
but
farmers
that
in
their
housekeeping
may
compare
with
a
lord
or
baron
in
some
countries
beyond
the
seas
yea
although
i
named
a
higher
degree
i
were
able
to
justify
we
have
no
such
golden
farmers
in
these
degenerate
days
the
mansion
was
originally
built
by
sir
ranulph
de
rookwood
or
as
it
was
then
written
rokewode
the
first
of
the
name
a
stout
yorkist
who
flourished
in
the
reign
of
edward
and
received
the
fair
domain
and
broad
lands
upon
which
the
edifice
was
raised
from
his
sovereign
in
reward
for
good
service
retiring
thither
in
the
decline
of
life
at
the
close
of
the
wars
of
the
roses
to
sequestrate
himself
from
scenes
of
strife
and
to
consult
his
spiritual
weal
in
the
erection
and
endowment
of
the
neighboring
church
it
was
of
mixed
architecture
and
combined
the
peculiarities
of
each
successive
era
retaining
some
of
the
sterner
features
of
earlier
days
the
period
ere
yet
the
embattled
peculiar
to
the
reigns
of
the
later
henrys
had
been
merged
into
the
graceful
and
peaceable
hall
the
residence
of
the
rookwoods
had
early
anticipated
the
gentler
characteristics
of
a
later
day
though
it
could
boast
little
of
that
exuberance
of
external
ornament
luxuriance
of
design
and
prodigality
of
beauty
which
under
the
sway
of
the
virgin
queen
distinguished
the
residence
of
the
wealthier
english
landowner
and
rendered
the
hall
of
elizabeth
properly
so
called
the
pride
and
boast
of
our
domestic
architecture
the
site
selected
by
sir
ranulph
for
his
habitation
had
been
already
occupied
by
a
vast
fabric
of
oak
which
he
in
part
removed
though
some
vestiges
might
still
be
traced
of
that
ancient
pile
a
massive
edifice
succeeded
with
gate
and
tower
court
and
moat
complete
substantial
enough
one
would
have
thought
to
have
endured
for
centuries
but
even
this
ponderous
structure
grew
into
disuse
and
sir
ranulph
successors
remodelling
repairing
almost
rebuilding
the
whole
mansion
in
the
end
so
metamorphosed
its
aspect
that
at
last
little
of
its
original
and
distinctive
character
remained
still
as
we
said
before
it
was
a
fine
old
house
though
some
changes
had
taken
place
for
the
worse
which
could
not
be
readily
pardoned
by
the
eye
of
taste
as
for
instance
the
deep
embayed
windows
had
dwindled
into
modernized
casements
of
lighter
construction
the
wide
porch
with
its
flight
of
steps
leading
to
the
great
hall
of
entrance
had
yielded
to
a
narrow
door
and
the
broad
quadrangular
court
was
succeeded
by
a
gravel
drive
yet
despite
all
these
changes
the
house
of
the
rookwoods
for
an
old
house
and
after
all
what
is
like
an
old
house
was
no
undesirable
or
uncongenial
abode
for
any
worshipful
country
gentleman
who
had
a
great
estate
the
hall
was
situated
near
the
base
of
a
gently
declining
hill
terminating
a
noble
avenue
of
limes
and
partially
embosomed
in
an
immemorial
wood
of
the
same
timber
which
had
given
its
name
to
the
family
that
dwelt
amongst
its
shades
descending
the
avenue
at
the
point
of
access
afforded
by
a
road
that
wound
down
the
towards
a
village
distant
about
half
a
mile
as
you
advanced
the
eye
was
first
arrested
by
a
singular
octagonal
turret
of
brick
of
more
recent
construction
than
the
house
and
in
all
probability
occupying
the
place
where
the
gateway
stood
of
yore
this
tower
rose
to
a
height
corresponding
with
the
roof
of
the
mansion
and
was
embellished
on
the
side
facing
the
house
with
a
flamingly
gilt
dial
peering
like
an
impudent
observer
at
all
that
passed
within
doors
two
apartments
which
it
contained
were
appropriated
to
the
despoiled
of
its
martial
honors
the
gateway
still
displayed
the
achievements
of
the
family
the
rook
and
the
fatal
branch
carved
in
granite
which
had
resisted
the
storms
of
two
centuries
though
stained
green
with
moss
and
mapped
over
with
lichens
to
the
left
overgrown
with
ivy
and
peeping
from
out
a
tuft
of
trees
appeared
the
hoary
summit
of
a
dovecot
indicating
the
near
neighborhood
of
an
ancient
barn
contemporary
with
the
earliest
and
of
a
little
world
of
offices
and
outbuildings
buried
in
the
thickness
of
the
foliage
to
the
right
was
the
garden
the
pleasaunce
of
the
place
formal
precise
artificial
yet
exquisite
for
commend
us
to
the
bygone
beautiful
english
garden
a
not
that
mixture
of
park
meadow
and
wilderness
brought
up
to
one
very
windows
which
since
the
days
of
the
innovators
kent
and
his
bold
associates
capability
brown
and
has
obtained
so
largely
this
a
garden
there
might
be
seen
the
stately
terraces
such
as
watteau
and
our
own
wilson
in
his
earlier
works
painted
the
trim
alleys
exhibiting
all
the
triumphs
of

and
a
hundred
luxuries
besides
suggested
and
contrived
by
art
to
render

most
enjoyable
and
to
enhance
the
recreative
delights
of
for
such
a
garden

be
with

sacrifice
of

and
convenience
epicurus
to
the
world
had
taught
that
pleasure
was
the
chiefest
good
and
was
perhaps
i
th
right
if
rightly
understood
his
life
he
to
his
doctrine
brought
and
in
his
garden
shade
that
sovereign
pleasure
all
these
delights
might
once
have
been
enjoyed
but
at
the
time
of
which
we
write
this
fair
garden
was
for
the
most
part
a
waste
and
unregarded
the
gay
parterres
were
disfigured
with
weeds
grass
grew
on
the
gravel
walk
several
of
the
urns
were
overthrown
the
hour
upon
the
dial
was
untold
the
fountain
was
choked
up
and
the
lawn
only
rescued
it
would
seem
from
the
general
fate
that
it
might
answer
the
purpose
of
a
as
the
implements
of
that
game
scattered
about
plainly
testified
diverging
from
the
garden
to
the
house
we
have
before
remarked
that
the
more
ancient
and
characteristic
features
of
the
place
had
been
for
the
most
part
destroyed
less
by
the
hand
of
time
than
to
suit
the
tastes
of
different
proprietors
this
however
was
not
so
observable
in
the
eastern
wing
which
overlooked
the
garden
here
might
be
discerned
many
indications
of
its
antiquity
the
strength
and
solidity
of
the
walls
which
had
not
been
as
elsewhere
masked
with
brickwork
the
low
tudor
arches
the
mullioned
bars
of
the
windows
all
attested
its
age
this
wing
was
occupied
by
an
upper
and
lower
gallery
communicating
with
suites
of
chambers
for
the
most
part
deserted
excepting
one
or
two
which
were
used
as
dormitories
and
another
little
room
on
the
with
an
oriel
window
opening
upon
the
lawn
and
commanding
the
prospect
beyond
a
favorite
resort
of
the
late

the
interior
was
curious
for
his
honeycomb
ceiling
deeply
moulded
in
plaster
with
the
arms
and
alliances
of
the
rookwoods
in
the
centre
was
the
royal
blazon

elizabeth
who
had
once
honored
the
hall
with
a
visit
during
a
progress

was
also
displayed
upon
the
immense
plate
of
iron

formed
the

return
for
a
moment
to
the
garden
which
we
linger
about
as
a
bee
around
a
flower
below
the
lawn
there
was
another
terrace
edged
by
a
low
balustrade
of
stone
commanding
a
lovely
view
of
park
water
and
woodland
high
waved
in
the
foreground
and
an
extensive
sweep

distant
horizon

changed
his
wives
as
easily
as
a
woman
changes
her

he
threw

the
second
head
the

disemboweled

victor
hugo
from
the
house
to
its
inhabitants
the
transition
is
natural
besides
the
connexion
between
them
there
were
many
points
of
resemblance
many
family
features
in
common
there
was
the
same
melancholy
grandeur
the
same
character
of
romance
the
same
fantastical
display
nor
were
the
secret
passages
peculiar
to
the
one
wanting
to
the
history
of
the
other
both
had
their
mysteries
one
blot
there
was
in
the
otherwise
proud
escutcheon
of
the
rookwoods
that
dimmed
its
splendor
and
made
pale
its
pretensions
their
sun
was
eclipsed
in
blood
from
its
rising
to
its
meridian
and
so
it
seemed
would
be
its
setting
this
foul
reproach
attached
to
all
the
race
none
escaped
it
traditional
rumors
were
handed
down
from
father
to
son
throughout
the
county
and
like
all
other
rumors
had
taken
to
themselves
wings
and
flown
abroad
their
crimes
became
a
how
was
it
they
escaped
punishment
how
came
they
to
evade
the
hand
of
justice
proof
was
ever
wanting
justice
was
ever
baffled
they
were
a
stern
and
people
of
indomitable
pride
and
resolution
with
for
the
most
part
force
of
character
sufficient
to
enable
them
to
breast
difficulties
and
dangers
that
would
have
overwhelmed
ordinary
individuals
no
quality
is
so
advantageous
to
its
possessor
as
firmness
and
the
determined
energy
of
the
rookwoods
bore
them
harmless
through
a
sea
of
trouble
besides
they
were
wealthy
lavish
even
to
profusion
and
gold
will
do
much
if
skilfully
administered
yet
despite
all
this
a
dark
ominous
cloud
settled
over
their
house
and
men
wondered
when
the
vengeance
of
heaven
so
long
delayed
would
fall
and
consume
it
possessed
of
considerable
landed
property
once
extending
over
nearly
half
the
west
riding
of
yorkshire
the
family
increased
in
power
and
importance
for
an
uninterrupted
series
of
years
until
the
outbreak
of
that
intestine
discord
which
ended
in
the
civil
wars
when
the
espousal
of
the
royalist
party
with
sword
and
substance
by
sir
ralph
rookwood
the
then
lord
of
the
mansion
a
dissolute
depraved
personage
who
however
had
been
made
a
knight
of
the
bath
at
the
coronation
of
charles
ended
in
his
own
destruction
at
naseby
and
the
wreck
of
much
of
his
property
a
loss
which
the
gratitude
of
charles
on
his
restoration
did
not
fail
to
make
good
to
sir
ralph
youthful
heir
reginald
sir
ralph
rookwood
left
two
sons
reginald
and
alan
the
fate
of
the
latter
was
buried
in
obscurity
it
was
even
a
mystery
to
his
family
he
was
it
was
said
a
youth
of
much
promise
and
of
gentle
manners
who
having
made
an
imprudent
match
from
jealousy
or
some
other
motive
deserted
his
wife
and
fled
his
country
various
reasons
were
assigned
for
his
conduct
amongst
others
it
was
stated
that
the
object
of
jealous
suspicions
was
his
elder
brother
reginald
and
that
it
was
the
discovery
of
his
wife
infidelity
in
this
quarter
which
occasioned
his
sudden
disappearance
with
his
infant
daughter
some
said
he
died
abroad
others
that
he
had
appeared
again
for
a
brief
space
at
the
hall
but
all
now
concurred
in
a
belief
of
his
decease
of
his
child
nothing
was
known
his
inconstant
wife
after
enduring
for
some
years
the
agonies
of
remorse
abandoned
by
sir
reginald
and
neglected
by
her
own
relatives
put
an
end
to
her
existence
by
poison
this
is
all
that
could
be
gathered
of
the
story
or
the
misfortunes
of
alan
rookwood
the
young
sir
reginald
had
attended
charles
in
the
character
of
page
during
his
exile
and
if
he
could
not
requite
the
devotion
of
the
son
by
absolutely
reinstating
the
fallen
fortunes
of
the
father
the
monarch
could
at
least
accord
him
the
fostering
influence
of
his
favor
and
countenance
and
bestow
upon
him
certain
lucrative
situations
in
his
household
as
an
earnest
of
his
and
thus
much
he
did
remarkable
for
his
personal
attractions
in
youth
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
we
should
find
the
name
of
reginald
rookwood
recorded
in
the
scandalous
chronicles
of
the
day
as
belonging
to
a
cavalier
of
infinite
address
and
discretion
matchless
wit
and
marvellous
pleasantry
and
eminent
beyond
his
peers
for
his
successes
with
some
of
the
most
distinguished
beauties
who
ornamented
that
brilliant
and
voluptuous
court
a
career
of
elegant
dissipation
ended
in
matrimony
his
first
match
was
unpropitious
foiled
in
his
attempts
upon
the
chastity
of
a
lady
of
great
beauty
and
high
honor
he
was
rash
enough
to
marry
her
rash
we
say
for
from
that
fatal
hour
all
became
as
darkness
the
curtain
fell
upon
the
comedy
of
his
life
to
rise
to
tragic
horrors
when
passion
subsided
repentance
awoke
and
he
became
anxious
for
deliverance
from
the
fetters
he
had
so
heedlessly
imposed
on
himself
and
on
his
unfortunate
dame
the
hapless
lady
of
sir
reginald
was
a
fair
and
fragile
creature
floating
on
the
eddying
current
of
existence
and
hurried
in
destruction
as
the
summer
gossamer
is
swept
away
by
the
rude
breeze
and
lost
forever
so
beautiful
so
gentle
was
she
that
if
sorrow
had
not
made
sorrow
more
beautiful
than
beauty
self
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
say
whether
the
charm
of
softness
and
sweetness
was
more
to
be
admired
than
her
faultless
personal
attractions
but
when
a
tinge
of
melancholy
came
saddening
and
shading
the
once
smooth
and
smiling
brow
when
tears
dimmed
the
blue
beauty
of
those
deep
and
tender
eyes
when
hot
hectic
flushes
supplied
the
place
of
healthful
bloom
and
despair
took
possession
of
her
heart
then
was
it
seen
was
the
charm
of
lady
rookwood
if
charm
that
could
be
called
which
was
a
saddening
sight
to
see
and
melted
the
soul
within
him
all
acknowledged
that
exquisite
as
she
had
been
before
the
sad
sweet
lady
was
now
more
exquisite
still
seven
moons
had
waned
and
flown
seven
bitter
tearful
moons
and
each
day
lady
rookwood
situation
claimed
more
soothing
attention
at
the
hand
of
her
lord
about
this
time
his
wife
brother
whom
he
hated
returned
from
the
dutch
wars
struck
with
his
sister
altered
appearance
he
readily
divined
the
cause
indeed
all
tongues
were
eager
to
proclaim
it
to
him
passionately
attached
to
her
lionel
vavasour
implored
an
explanation
of
the
cause
of
his
sister
griefs
the
bewildered
lady
answered
evasively
attributing
her
looks
to
any
other
cause
than
her
husband
cruelty
and
pressing
her
brother
as
he
valued
her
peace
her
affection
never
to
allude
to
the
subject
again
the
fiery
youth
departed
he
next
sought
out
his
and
taxed
him
sharply
with
his
inhumanity
adding
threats
to
his
upbraidings
sir
reginald
listened
silently
and
calmly
when
the
other
had
finished
with
a
sarcastic
obeisance
he
replied
sir
i
am
much
beholden
for
the
trouble
you
have
taken
in
your
sister
behalf
but
when
she
entrusted
herself
to
my
keeping
she
relinquished
i
conceive
all
claim
on
guardianship
however
i
thank
you
for
the
trouble
you
have
taken
but
for
your
own
sake
i
would
venture
to
caution
you
against
a
repetition
of
interference
like
the
present
and
i
sir
caution
see
that
you
give
heed
to
my
words
or
by
the
heaven
above
us
i
will
enforce
attention
to
them
you
will
find
me
sir
as
prompt
at
all
times
to
defend
my
conduct
as
i
am
unalterable
in
my
purposes
your
sister
is
my
wife
what
more
would
you
have
were
she
a
harlot
you
should
have
her
back
and
welcome

some
scheme
and
take
her
with
you
hence
so

of
her
i
am
content
rookwood
you
are
a
villain
and
vavasour
spat
upon
his
cheek
sir
reginald
eyes
blazed
his
sword
started
from
its
scabbard
defend
yourself
he
exclaimed
furiously
attacking
vavasour
pass
after
pass
was
exchanged
fierce
thrusts
were
made
and
parried
feint
and
appeal
the
most
desperate
and
dexterous
were
resorted
to
their
swords
glanced
like
lightning
flashes
in
the
struggle
the
blades
became
entangled
there
was
a
moment
cessation
each
glanced
at
the
other
with
deadly
inextinguishable
hate
both
were
admirable
masters
of
the
art
of
defence
both
were
so
brimful
of
wrath
as
to
be
regardless
of
consequences
they
tore
back
their
weapons
vavasour
blade
shivered
he
was
at
the
mercy
of
his
adversary
an
adversary
who
knew
no
mercy
sir
reginald
passed
his
rapier
through
his
brother
body
the
hilt
struck
against
his
ribs
sir
reginald
ire
was
kindled
not
extinguished
by
the
deed
he
had
done
like
the
tiger
he
had
tasted
blood
like
the
tiger
he
thirsted
for
more
he
sought
his
home
he
was
greeted
by
his
wife
terrified
by
his
looks
she
yet
summoned
courage
sufficient
to
approach
him
she
embraced
his
arm
she
clasped
his
hand
sir
reginald
smiled
his
smile
was
cutting
as
his
dagger
edge
what
ails
you
sweetheart
said
he
i
know
not
your
smile
frightens
me
my
smile
frightens
you
fool
be
thankful
that
i
frown
not
oh

gentle
my
reginald
as
you
were
when
first
i
knew

so
coldly
but

may
for
one
instant
dream

silly
wench

have
endured
this
morning
on
your
account

brother
lionel
has
been
here
indeed
nay

not
so
he
insisted
on
knowing
the
reason
of
my
altered
appearance
and
no
doubt
you
made
him
acquainted
with
the
cause
you
told
him
version
of
the
story
not
a
word
as
i
hope
to
live
a
lie
by
my
truth
no

i
say
he
avouched
it
to
me
himself
impossible
he
could
not

not
disobey
me
sir
reginald
laughed
bitterly
he
would
not
i
am
sure
give
utterance
to
any
scandal
continued
lady
rookwood

say
this
but
to
try
me

your
hand

bloody

him
whose
blood
is
this
your
brother
spat
upon
my
check
i
have
washed
out
the
stain
replied
sir
reginald
coldly
then
it
his
blood
shrieked
lady
rookwood
pressing
her
hand
shuddering
before
her
eyes
is
he
dead
sir
reginald
turned
away
stay
she
cried
exerting
her
feeble
strength
to
retain
him
and
becoming
white
as
ashes

and
hear

you
have
killed
me
i
feel
by
your
cruelty

dripping
in
his
blood
and
i
have
kissed

clasped

and
now
continued
she
with
an
energy
that
shook
sir
reginald
i
hate
you
i
renounce
you
forever
may
my
dying
words
ring
in
your
ears
on
your
for
that
hour
come
you
can
not
shun
then

of

of
away
interrupted
sir
reginald
endeavoring
to
shake
her
off
i
will
away
i
will
cling
to
you
will
curse
you
my
unborn
child
shall
live
to
curse

to
requite

to
visit
my
wrongs
on
you
and
yours
weak
as
i
am
you
shall
not
cast
me
off
you
shall
learn
to
fear
even
i
fear
nothing
living
much
less
a
frantic
woman
fear
the
then
there
was
a
struggle
a
blow
and
the
wretched
lady
sank
shrieking
upon
the
floor
convulsions
seized
her
a
mother
pains
succeeded
fierce
and
fast
she
spoke
no
more
but
died
within
the
hour
giving
birth
to
a
female
child
eleanor
rookwood
became
her
father
idol
her
father
bane
all
the
love
he
had
to
bestow
was
centred
in
her
she
returned
it
not
she
fled
from
his
caresses
with
all
her
mother
beauty
she
had
all
her
father
pride
sir
reginald
every
thought
was
for
his
daughter
for
her
aggrandizement
in
vain
she
seemed
only
to
endure
him
and
while
his
affection
waxed
stronger
and
entwined
itself
round
her
alone
she
withered
beneath
his
embraces
as
the
shrub
withers
in
the
clasping
folds
of
the
parasite
plant
she
grew
towards
womanhood
suitors
thronged
around
her
gentle
and
noble
ones
sir
reginald
watched
them
with
a
jealous
eye
he
was
wealthy
powerful
high
in
royal
favor
and
could
make
his
own
election
he
did
so
for
the
first
time
eleanor
promised
obedience
to
his
wishes
they
accorded
with
her
own
humor
the
day
was
appointed
it
came
but
with
it
came
not
the
bride
she
had
fled
with
the
humblest
and
the
meanest
of
the
pretenders
to
her
hand
with
one
upon
whom
sir
reginald
supposed
she
had
not
deigned
to
cast
her
eyes
he
endeavored
to
forget
her
and
to
all
outward
seeming
was
successful
in
the
effort
but
he
felt
that
the
curse
was
upon
him
the
undying
flame
scorched
his
heart
once
and
once
only
they
met
again
in
france
whither
she
had
wandered
it
was
a
dread
encounter
terrible
to
both
but
most
so
to
sir
reginald
he
spoke
not
of
her
afterwards
shortly
after
the
death
of
his
first
wife
sir
reginald
had
made
proposals
to
a
dowager
of
distinction
with
a
handsome
jointure
one
of
his
early
attachments
and
was
without
scruple
accepted
the
power
of
the
family
might
then
be
said
to
be
at
its
zenith
and
but
for
certain
untoward
circumstances
and
the
growing
influence
of
his
enemies
sir
reginald
would
have
been
elevated
to
the
peerage
like
most
reformed
he
had
become
proportionately
avaricious
and
his
mind
seemed
engrossed
in
accumulating
wealth
in
the
meantime
his
second
wife
followed
her
predecessor
dying
it
was
said
of
vexation
and
disappointment
the
propensity
to
matrimony
always
a
distinguishing
characteristic
of
the
rookwoods
largely
displayed
itself
in
sir
reginald
another
dame
followed
equally
rich
younger
and
far
more
beautiful
than
her
immediate
predecessor
she
was
a
prodigious
flirt
and
soon
set
her
husband
at
defiance
sir
reginald
did
not
condescend
to
expostulate
it
was
not
his
way
he
effectually
prevented
any
recurrence
of
her
indiscretions
she
was
removed
and
with
her
expired
sir
waning
popularity
so
strong
was
the
expression
of
odium
against
him
that
he
thought
it
prudent
to
retire
to
his
mansion
in
the
country
and
there
altogether
seclude
himself
one
anomaly
in
sir
otherwise
utterly
selfish
character
was
uncompromising
devotion
to
the
house
of
stuart
and
shortly
after
the
abdication
of
james
he
followed
that
monarch
to
saint
germain
having
previously
mixed
largely
in
secret
political
intrigues
and
only
returned
from
the
french
court
to
lay
his
bones
with
those
of
his
ancestry
in
the
family
vault
at
rookwood
piers
my
old
master
kept
a
good
house
and
twenty
or
thirty
tall
men
about
him
and
in
faith
his
son
differs
not
much
he
will
have
metal
too
though
he
has
no
store
of
blades
he
will
have
plenty
of
vintners
pots
his
father
kept
a
good
house
for
honest
men
his
tenants
that
brought
him
in
part
and
his
son
keeps
a
bad
house
with
knaves
that
help
to
consume
all
is
but
the
change
of
time
why
should
any
man
repine
at
it
crickets
good
loving
and
lucky
worms
were
wont
to
feed
sing
and
rejoice
in
the
father
chimney
and
now
carrion
crows
build
in
the
kitchen
wilkins
of
enforced
sir
reginald
died
leaving
issue
three
children
a
daughter
the
eleanor
who
entirely
discountenanced
by
the
family
had
been
seemingly
forgotten
by
all
but
her
father
and
two
sons
by
his
third
wife
reginald
the
eldest
whose
military
taste
had
early
procured
him
the
command
of
a
company
of
horse
and
whose
politics
did
not
coalesce
with
those
of
his
sire
fell
during
his
father
lifetime
at
killiecrankie
under
the
banners
of
william
piers
therefore
the
second
son
succeeded
to
the
title
a
very
different
character
in
many
respects
from
his
father
and
brother
holding
in
supreme
dislike
courts
and
courtiers
party
warfare
political
intrigue
and
all
the
subtleties
of
jesuitical
diplomacy
neither
having
any
inordinate
relish
for
camps
or
campaigns
sir
piers
rookwood
yet
displayed
in
early
life
one
family
propensity
unremitting
devotion
to
the
sex
among
his
other
mistresses
was
the
unfortunate
susan
bradley
in
whom
by
some
he
was
supposed
to
have
been
clandestinely
united
in
early
youth
as
has
been
stated
sir
piers
professed
the
faith
of
rome
but
shortly
after
the
death
of
his
beautiful
mistress
or
wife
as
it
might
be
having
quarreled
with
his
father
confessor
checkley
he
publicly
abjured
his
heresies
sir
piers
subsequently
allied
himself
to
maud
only
daughter
of
sir
thomas
the
last
of
a
line
as
proud
and
intolerant
as
his
own
the
tables
were
then
turned
lady
rookwood
usurped
sovereign
sway
over
her
lord
and
sir
piers
a
cipher
in
his
own
house
scarce
master
of
himself
much
less
of
his
dame
endured
an
existence
so
miserable
that
he
was
often
heard
to
regret
in
his
cups
that
he
had
not
inherited
with
the
estate
of
his
forefathers
the
family
secret
of
shaking
off
the
matrimonial
yoke
when
found
to
press
too
hardly
at
the
onset
sir
piers
struggled
hard
to
burst
his
bondage
but
in
vain
he
was
fast
fettered
and
only
bruised
himself
like
the
caged
lark
against
the
bars
of
his
abandoning
all
further
effort
at
emancipation
he
gave
himself
up
to
the
usual
resource
of
a
weak
mind
debauchery
and
drank
so
deeply
to
drown
his
cares
that
in
the
end
his
hale
constitution
yielded
to
his
excesses
it
was
even
said
that
remorse
at
his
abandonment
of
the
faith
of
his
fathers
had
some
share
in
his
misery
and
that
his
old
spiritual
and
if
report
spoke
truly
sinful
adviser
father
checkley
had
visited
him
secretly
at
the
hall
sir
piers
was
observed
to
shudder
whenever
the
name
was
mentioned
sir
piers
rookwood
was
a
man
in
the
main
had
little
of
the
old
family
leaven
about
him
and
was
esteemed
by
his
associates
of
late
however
his
temper
became
soured
and
his
friends
deserted
him
for
between
his
domestic
annoyances
remorseful
feelings
and
the
inroads
already
made
upon
his
constitution
by
constant
inebriety
he
grew
so
desperate
and
insane
in
his
revels
and
committed
such
fearful
extravagances
that
even
his
boon
companions
shrank
from
his
orgies
fearful
were
the
scenes
between
him
and
lady
rookwood
upon
these
occasions
appalling
to
the
witnesses
dreadful
to
themselves
and
it
was
perhaps
their
frequent
recurrence
that
more
than
anything
else
banished
all
decent
society
from
the
hall
at
the
time
of
sir
piers
decease
which
brings
us
down
to
the
date
of
our
story
his
son
and
successor
ranulph
was
absent
on
his
travels
shortly
after
the
completion
of
his
academical
education
he
had
departed
to
make
the
tour
of
the
continent
and
had
been
absent
rather
better
than
a
year
he
had
quitted
his
father
in
displeasure
and
was
destined
never
again
to
see
his
face
while
living
the
last
intelligence
received
of
young
rookwood
was
from
bordeaux
whence
it
was
thought
he
had
departed
for
the
pyrenees
a
special
messenger
had
been
despatched
in
search
of
him
with
tidings
of
the
melancholy
event
but
as
it
was
deemed
improbable
by
lady
rookwood
that
her
son
could
return
within
any
reasonable
space
she
gave
directions
for
the
accomplishment
of
the
funeral
rites
of
her
husband
on
the
sixth
night
after
his
decease
it
being
the
custom
of
the
rookwoods
ever
to
inter
their
dead
at
midnight
intrusting
their
solemnization
entirely
to
the
care
of
one
of
sir
piers
titus
tyrconnel
for
which
she
was
greatly
scandalized
in
the
neighborhood
ranulph
rookwood
was
a
youth
of
goodly
promise
the
stock
from
which
he
sprang
would
on
neither
side
warrant
such
conclusion
but
it
sometimes
happens
that
from
the
darkest
elements
are
compounded
the
brightest
and
subtlest
substances
and
so
it
occurred
in
this
instance
fair
frank
and
free
generous
open
unsuspicious
he
seemed
the
very
opposite
of
all
his
race
their
antagonizing
principle
capriciously
indulgent
his
father
had
allowed
him
ample
means
neither
curbing
nor
restraining
his
expenditure
acceding
at
one
moment
to
every
inclination
and
the
next
irresolutely
opposing
it
it
was
impossible
therefore
for
him
in
such
a
state
of
things
to
act
decidedly
without
incurring
his
displeasure
and
the
only
measure
he
resolved
upon
which
was
to
absent
himself
for
a
time
was
conjectured
to
have
brought
about
the
result
he
had
endeavored
to
avoid
other
reasons
however
there
were
which
secretly
influenced
him
which
it
will
be
our
business
in
due
time
to
detail
how
croaks
the
raven
is
our
good
duchess
dead
dead
webster
the
time
of
the
sad
ceremonial
drew
nigh
the
hurrying
of
the
domestics
to
and
fro
the
multifarious
arrangements
for
the
night
the
distribution
of
the
melancholy
trappings
and
the
discussion
of
the
meats
furnished
abundant
occupation
within
doors
without
there
was
a
constant
stream
of
the
tenantry
thronging
down
the
avenue
mixed
with
an
occasional
horseman
once
or
twice
intercepted
by
a
large
lumbering
carriage
bringing
friends
of
the
deceased
some
really
anxious
to
pay
the
last
tribute
of
regard
but
the
majority
attracted
by
the
anticipated
spectacle
of
a
funeral
by
torchlight
there
were
others
indeed
to
whom
it
was
not
matter
of
choice
who
were
compelled
by
a
vassal
tenure
of
their
lands
held
of
the
house
of
rookwood
to
lend
a
shoulder
to
the
coffin
and
a
hand
to
the
torch
on
the
burial
of
its
lord
of
these
there
was
a
plentiful
muster
collected
in
the
hall
they
were
to
be
marshalled
by
peter
bradley
who
was
deemed
to
be
well
skilled
in
the
proceedings
having
been
present
at
two
solemnities
of
the
kind
that
mysterious
personage
however
had
not
made
his
appearance
to
the
great
dismay
of
the
assemblage
scouts
were
sent
in
search
of
him
but
they
returned
with
the
intelligence
that
the
door
of
his
habitation
was
fastened
and
its
inmate
apparently
absent
no
other
tidings
of
the
truant
sexton
could
be
obtained
it
was
a
sultry
august
evening
no
breeze
was
stirring
in
the
garden
no
cool
dews
refreshed
the
parched
and
heated
earth
yet
from
the
languishing
flowers
rich
sweets
exhaled
the
plash
of
a
fountain
fell
pleasantly
upon
the
ear
conveying
in
its
sound
a
sense
of
freshness
to
the
fervid
air
while
deep
and
drowsy
murmurs
hummed
heavily
beneath
the
trees
making
the
twilight
slumberously
musical
the
westering
sun
which
filled
the
atmosphere
with
flame
throughout
the
day
was
now
wildly
setting
and
as
he
sank
behind
the
hall
its
varied
and
picturesque
tracery
became
each
instant
more
darkly
and
distinctly
defined
against
the
crimson
sky
at
this
juncture
a
little
gate
communicating
with
the
chase
was
thrown
open
and
a
young
man
entered
the
garden
passing
through
the
shrubbery
and
hurrying
rapidly
forward
till
he
arrived
at
a
vista
opening
upon
the
house
the
spot
at
which
the
stranger
halted
was
marked
by
a
little
basin
scantily
supplied
with
water
streaming
from
a
lion
kingly
jaws
his
dress
was
and
dusty
and
his
whole
appearance
betokened
great
exhaustion
from
heat
and
fatigue
seating
himself
upon
an
adjoining
bench
he
threw
off
his
and
unclasped
his
collar
displaying
a
head
and
neck
and
a
countenance
which
besides
its
beauty
had
that
rare
nobility
of
feature
which
seldom
falls
to
the
lot
of
the
aristocrat
but
is
never
seen
in
one
of
an
inferior
order
a
restless
disquietude
of
manner
showed
that
he
was
suffering
from
of
mind
as
well
as
from
bodily
exertion
his
look
was
wild
and
hurried
his
black
ringlets
were
dashed
heedlessly
over
a
pallid
lofty
brow
upon
which
care
was
prematurely
written
while
his
large
melancholy
eyes
were
bent
with
a
look
almost
of
agony
upon
the
house
before
him
after
a
short
pause
and
as
if
struggling
against
violent
emotions
and
some
overwhelming
remembrance
the
youth
arose
and
plunged
his
hand
into
the
basin
applying
the
moist
element
to
his
burning
brow
apparently
becoming
more
calm
he
bent
his
steps
towards
the
hall
when
two
figures
suddenly
issuing
from
an
adjoining
copse
arrested
his
progress
neither
saw
him
muttering
a
hurried
farewell
one
of
the
figures
disappeared
within
the
shrubbery
and
the
other
confronting
the
stranger
displayed
the
harsh
features
and
gaunt
form
of
peter
bradley
had
peter
encountered
the
dead
sir
piers
in
corporeal
form
he
could
not
have
manifested
more
surprise
than
he
exhibited
for
an
instant
or
two
as
he
shrunk
back
from
the
stranger
path
irish
a
most
outrageous
roaring
fellow
with
a
swelled
red
face
inflamed
with
of
an
hour
or
two
prior
to
the
incident
just
narrated
in
a
small
cosy
apartment
of
the
hall
nominally
devoted
to
justiciary
business
by
its
late
owner
but
in
reality
used
as
a
sanctum
snuggery
or
a
singular
trio
were
assembled
fraught
with
the
ulterior
purpose
of
attending
the
obsequies
of
their
deceased
patron
and
friend
though
immediately
occupied
in
the
discussion
of
a
magnum
of
excellent
claret
the
bouquet
of
which
perfumed
the
air
like
the
fragrance
of
a
bed
of
violets
this
little
room
had
been
poor
sir
piers
favorite
retreat
it
was
in
fact
the
only
room
in
the
house
that
he
could
call
his
own
and
thither
would
he
often
with
pipe
and
punch
beguile
the
flagging
hours
secure
from
interruption
a
snug
apartment
it
was
wainscoted
with
rich
black
oak
with
a
fine
old
cabinet
of
the
same
material
and
a
line
or
two
of
crazy
bookshelves
laden
with
sundry
dusty
unconsulted
law
tomes
and
a
light
sprinkling
of
the
elder
divines
equally
neglected
the
only
book
indeed
sir
piers
ever
read
was
the
anatomie
of
melancholy
and
he
merely
studied
burton
because
the
quaint
racy
style
of
the
learned
old
hypochondriac
suited
his
humor
at
seasons
and
gave
a
zest
to
his
sorrows
such
as
the
olives
lent
to
his
wine
four
portraits
adorned
the
walls
those
of
sir
reginald
rookwood
and
his
wives
the
ladies
were
attired
in
the
flowing
drapery
of
charles
the
second
day
the
snow
of
their
radiant
bosoms
being
somewhat
sullied
by
and
the
vermeil
tinting
of
their
cheeks
darkened
by
the
fumes
of
tobacco
there
was
a
shepherdess
with
her
taper
crook
whose
large
languishing
eyes
ripe
pouting
lips
ready
to
melt
into
kisses
and
air
of
voluptuous
abandonment
scarcely
suited
the
innocent
simplicity
of
her
costume
she
was
portrayed
tending
a
flock
of
downy
sheep
with
azure
ribbons
round
their
necks
accompanied
by
one
of
those
invaluable
little
dogs
whose
length
of
ear
and
silkiness
of
skin
evinced
him
perfect
in
his
breeding
but
whose
indifference
to
his
charge
proved
him
to
be
as
much
out
of
character
with
his
situation
as
the
refined
and
luxuriant
charms
of
his
mistress
were
out
of
keeping
with
her
artless
attire
this
was
sir
piers
mother
the
third
wife
a
beautiful
woman
answering
to
the
notion
of
one
who
had
been
somewhat
of
a
flirt
in
her
day
next
to
her
was
a
magnificent
dame
with
the
throat
and
arm
of
a
juno
and
a
superb
bust
the
bust
was
then
what
the
bustle
is
now
a
paramount
attraction
whether
the
modification
be
an
improvement
we
leave
to
the
consideration
of
the
lovers
of
the
beautiful
this
was
the
dowager
lastly
there
was
the
lovely
and
eleanor
every
gentle
grace
belonging
to
this
unfortunate
lady
had
been
stamped
in
undying
beauty
on
the
canvas
by
the
hand
of
lely
breathing
a
spell
on
the
picture
almost
as
powerful
as
that
which
had
dwelt
around
the
exquisite
original
over
the
high
carved
mantelpiece
was
suspended
the
portrait
of
sir
reginald
it
had
been
painted
in
early
youth
the
features
were
beautiful
disdainful
with
a
fierceness
breaking
through
the
courtly
air
the
eyes
were
very
fine
black
as
midnight
and
piercing
as
those
of
cæsar
borgia
as
seen
in
wonderful
picture
in
the
borghese
palace
at
rome
they
seemed
to
fascinate
the
gazer
to
rivet
his
glances
to
follow
him
whithersoever
he
went
and
to
search
into
his
soul
as
did
the
dark
orbs
of
sir
reginald
in
his
lifetime
it
was
the
work
likewise
of
lely
and
had
all
the
fidelity
and
graceful
refinement
of
that
great
master
nor
was
the
haughty
countenance
of
sir
reginald
unworthy
the
patrician
painter
no
portrait
of
sir
piers
was
to
be
met
with
but
in
lieu
thereof
depending
from
a
pair
of
buck
horns
hung
the
worthy
knight
stained
scarlet
coat
the
same
in
which
he
had
ridden
forth
with
the
intent
to
hunt
on
the
eventful
occasion
detailed
by
peter
bradley
his
velvet
cap
his
whip
and
the
residue
of
his
equipment
for
the
chase
this
attire
was
reviewed
with
melancholy
interest
and
unaffected
emotion
by
the
company
as
reminding
them
forcibly
of
the
departed
of
which
it
seemed
a
portion
the
party
consisted
of
the
vicar
of
rookwood
polycarp
small
titus
tyrconnel
an
emigrant
and
empirical
professor
of
medicine
from
the
sister
isle
whose
convivial
habits
had
first
introduced
him
to
the
hall
and
afterwards
retained
him
there
and
codicil
coates
clerk
of
the
peace
bailiff
and
receiver
we
were
wrong
in
saying
that
tyrconnel
was
retained
he
was
an
impudent
intrusive
fellow
whom
having
once
gained
a
footing
in
the
house
it
was
impossible
to
dislodge
he
cared
for
no
insult
perceived
no
slight
and
professed
in
her
presence
the
profoundest
respect
for
lady
rookwood
in
short
he
was
ever
ready
to
do
anything
but
depart
sir
piers
was
one
of
those
people
who
can
not
dine
alone
he
disliked
a
solitary
repast
almost
as
much
as
a
with
his
lady
he
would
have
been
recognized
at
once
as
the
true
amphitryon
had
any
one
been
hardy
enough
to
play
the
part
of
jupiter
ever
ready
to
give
a
dinner
he
found
a
difficulty
arise
not
usually
experienced
on
such
occasions
there
was
no
one
upon
whom
to
bestow
it
he
had
the
best
of
wine
kept
an
excellent
table
was
himself
no
niggard
host
but
his
own
merits
and
those
of
his
were
forgotten
in
the
invariable
to
the
feast
and
the
best
of
wine
lost
its
flavor
when
the
last
bottle
found
its
way
to
the
guest
head
dine
alone
sir
piers
would
not
and
as
his
old
friends
forsook
him
he
plunged
lower
in
his
search
of
society
collecting
within
his
house
a
class
of
persons
whom
no
one
would
have
expected
to
meet
at
the
hall
nor
even
its
owner
have
chosen
for
his
companions
had
any
choice
remained
to
him
he
did
not
endure
this
state
of
things
without
much
outward
show
of
discontent
anything
for
a
quiet
life
was
his
constant
saying
and
like
the
generality
of
people
with
whom
those
words
form
a
favorite
maxim
he
led
the
most
uneasy
life
imaginable
endurance
to
excite
commiseration
must
be
uncomplaining
an
axiom
the
aggrieved
of
the
gentle
sex
should
remember
sir
piers
endured
but
he
grumbled
lustily
and
was
on
all
hands
voted
a
bore
domestic
grievances
especially
if
the
husband
be
the
plaintiff
being
the
most
intolerable
of
all
mentionable
miseries
no
wonder
that
his
friends
deserted
him
still
there
was
titus
tyrconnel
his
ears
and
lips
were
ever
open
to
pathos
and
to
punch
so
titus
kept
his
station
immediately
after
her
husband
demise
it
had
been
lady
rookwood
intention
to
clear
the
house
of
all
the
vermin
so
she
expressed
herself
that
had
so
long
infested
it
and
forcibly
to
eject
titus
and
one
or
two
other
intruders
of
the
same
class
but
in
consequence
of
certain
hints
received
from
coates
who
represented
the
absolute
necessity
of
complying
with
sir
piers
testamentary
instructions
which
were
particular
in
that
respect
she
thought
proper
to
defer
her
intentions
until
after
the
ceremonial
of
interment
should
be
completed
and
in
the
mean
time
strange
to
say
committed
its
arrangement
to
titus
tyrconnel
who
ever
ready
to
accommodate
accepted
nothing
loth
the
charge
and
acquitted
himself
admirably
well
in
his
undertaking
especially
as
he
said
in
the
aiting
and
drinking
department
the
most
essential
part
of
it
all
he
kept
open
house
open
open
cellar
resolved
that
his
patron
funeral
should
emulate
as
much
as
possible
an
irish
burial
on
a
grand
scale
the
finest
sight
in
his
opinion
in
the
whole
world
inflated
with
the
importance
of
his
office
inflamed
with
heat
sat
titus
like
a
robustious
alderman
after
a
civic
feast
the
natural
rubicundity
of
his
countenance
was
darkened
to
a
deep
purple
tint
like
that
of
a
peony
while
his
ludicrous
dignity
was
augmented
by
a
shining
suit
of
sables
in
which
his
portly
person
was
invested
the
first
magnum
had
been
discussed
in
solemn
silence
the
cloud
however
which
hung
over
the
conclave
disappeared
under
the
genial
influence
of
another
and
a
better
bottle
and
gave
place
to
a
denser
vapor
occasioned
by
the
introduction
of
the
pipe
and
its
accompaniments
ensconced
in
a
comfortable
old
chair
it
is
not
every
old
chair
that
comfortable
with
pipe
in
mouth
and
in
full
unbuttoned
ease
his
bushy
cauliflower
wig
laid
aside
by
reason
of
the
heat
reposed
small
small
indeed
was
somewhat
of
a
misnomer
as
applied
to
the
worthy
doctor
who
besides
being
no
diminutive
specimen
of
his
kind
entertained
no
insignificant
opinion
of
himself
his
height
was
certainly
not
remarkable
but
his
width
of
shoulder
his
sesquipedality
of
stomach
and
obesity
of
calf
these
were
unique
of
his
origin
we
know
nothing
but
presume
he
must
in
some
way
or
other
have
been
connected
with
the
numerous
family
of
the
smalls
who
according
to
christopher
north
form
the
predominant
portion
of
mankind
in
appearance
the
doctor
was
and
puffy
with
a
sodden
pasty
face
wherein
were
set
eyes
whose
obliquity
of
vision
was
in
some
measure
redeemed
by
their
expression
of
humor
he
was
accounted
a
man
of
parts
and
erudition
and
had
obtained
high
honors
at
his
university
rigidly
orthodox
he
abominated
the
very
names
of
papists
and
jacobites
amongst
which
heretical
herd
he
classed
his
companion
titus
tyrconnel
ireland
being
with
him
synonymous
with
superstition
and
catholicism
and
every
irishman
rebellious
and
schismatical
on
this
head
he
was
inclined
to
be
disputatious
his
prejudices
did
not
prevent
him
from
passing
the
claret
nor
from
laughing
as
heartily
as
a
plethoric
asthma
and
sense
of
the
decorum
due
to
the
occasion
would
permit
at
the
quips
and
quirks
of
the
irishman
who
he
admitted
notwithstanding
his
heresies
was
a
pleasant
fellow
in
the
main
and
when
in
addition
to
the
flattery
a
pipe
had
been
insinuated
by
the
officious
titus
at
the
precise
moment
that
small
yearned
for
his
afternoon
solace
yet
scrupled
to
ask
for
it
when
the
door
had
been
made
fast
and
the
first
whiff
exhaled
all
his
misgivings
vanished
and
he
surrendered
himself
to
the
soft
seduction
in
this
elysian
state
we
find
him
ah
you
may
say
that
small
said
titus
in
answer
to
some
observation
of
the
vicar
that
a
most
original
apothegm
we
all
of
us
hould
our
lives
by
a
thrid
och
many
the
sudden
finale
i
have
seen
many
the
fine
fellow
heels
tripped
up
unawares
when
least
expected
death
hangs
over
our
heads
by
a
single
hair
as
your
reverence
says
precisely
like
the
sword
of
dan
maclise
the
flatterer
of
dinnish
ready
to
fall
at
a
moment
notice
or
no
notice
at
all
eh
mr
coates
and
that
brings
me
back
again
to
sir
piers
poor
gentleman
ah
we
soon
see
the
like
of
him
again
poor
sir
piers
said
coates
a
small
man
in
a
scratch
wig
with
a
face
red
and
round
as
an
apple
and
almost
as
diminutive
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
his
should
so
much
have
hastened
his
lamented
demise
conviviality
replied
titus
no
such
thing
it
was
apoplexy
extravasation
of
extra
of
rum
and
water
you
mean
replied
coates
who
like
all
his
tribe
rejoiced
in
a
quibble
the
squire
ailment
continued
titus
was
a
sanguineous
effusion
as
we
call
it
positive
determination
of
blood
to
the
head
occasioned
by
a
low
way
he
got
into
just
before
his
attack
a
confirmed
case
of
hypochondriasis
as
that
book
sir
piers
was
so
fond
of
terms
the
blue
devils
he
neglected
the
bottle
which
in
a
man
who
has
been
a
hard
drinker
all
his
life
is
a
bad
sign
the
lowering
system
never
answers
never
doctor
i
just
trouble
you
for
small
in
a
fit
of
absence
had
omitted
to
pass
the
bottle
though
not
to
help
himself
had
he
stuck
to
holding
up
a
glass
ruby
bright
the
elixir
vitæ
the
grand
panacea
he
might
have
been
hale
and
hearty
at
this
present
moment
and
as
well
as
any
of
us
but
he
would
be
advised
to
my
thinking
as
that
was
the
case
he
have
been
all
the
better
for
a
little
of
your
reverence
sperretual
advice
and
his
conscience
having
been
relieved
by
confession
and
absolution
he
might
have
opened
a
fresh
account
with
an
aisy
heart
and
clane
breast
i
trust
sir
said
small
gravely
withdrawing
his
pipe
from
his
lips
that
sir
piers
rookwood
addressed
himself
to
a
higher
source
than
a
sinning
creature
of
clay
like
himself
for
remission
of
his
sins
but
if
there
was
any
load
of
secret
guilt
that
might
have
weighed
heavy
upon
his
conscience
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
he
refused
the
last
offices
of
the
church
and
died
incommunicate
i
was
denied
all
admittance
to
his
chamber
exactly
my
case
said
coates
pettishly
i
was
refused
entrance
though
my
business
was
of
the
utmost
importance
certain
dispositions
special
bequests
matter
connected
with
his
sister
for
though
the
estate
is
entailed
yet
still
there
are
charges
you
understand
me
very
strange
to
refuse
to
see
some
people
may
regret
it
may
live
to
regret
it
i
say
that
all
i
just
sent
up
a
package
to
lady
rookwood
which
was
not
to
be
delivered
till
after
sir
piers
death
odd
circumstance
that
been
in
my
custody
a
long
while
some
reason
to
think
sir
piers
meant
to
alter
his
will
ought
to
have
seen
sad
neglect
more
the
pity
but
it
was
none
of
poor
sir
piers
doing
replied
titus
he
had
no
will
of
his
own
poor
fellow
during
his
life
and
the
devil
a
will
was
he
likely
to
have
after
his
death
it
was
all
lady
rookwood
doing
added
he
in
a
whisper
i
his
medical
adviser
and
confidential
friend
was
ordered
out
of
the
room
and
although
i
knew
it
was
as
much
as
his
life
was
worth
to
leave
him
for
a
moment
in
that
state
i
was
forced
to
comply
and
would
you
believe
it
as
i
left
the
room
i
heard
high
words
yes
doctor
as
i
hope
to
be
saved
words
of
anger
from
her
at
that
awful
juncture
the
latter
part
of
this
speech
was
uttered
in
a
low
tone
and
very
mysterious
manner
the
speakers
drew
so
closely
together
that
the
bowls
of
their
pipes
formed
a
common
centre
whence
the
stems
radiated
a
momentary
silence
ensued
during
which
each
man
puffed
for
very
life
small
next
knocked
the
ashes
from
his
tube
and
began
to
replenish
it
coughing
significantly
coates
expelled
a
thin
curling
stream
of
vapor
from
a
minute
orifice
in
the
corner
of
his
almost
invisible
mouth
and
arched
his
eyebrows
in
a
singular
manner
as
if
he
dared
not
trust
the
expression
of
his
thoughts
to
any
other
feature
titus
shook
his
huge
head
and
upon
the
strength
of
a
bumper
which
he
swallowed
mustered
resolution
enough
to
unburden
his
bosom
by
my
sowl
said
he
mysteriously
i
seen
enough
lately
to
frighten
any
quiet
gentleman
out
of
his
senses
i
not
get
a
wink
of
sleep
i
fear
for
a
week
to
come
there
must
have
been
something
dreadful
upon
sir
piers
mind
sure
nay
there
no
use
in
mincing
the
matter
with
in
a
word
then
some
crime
too
deep
to
be
divulged
crime
echoed
coates
and
small
in
a
breath
ay
crime
repeated
titus
whist
not
so
loud
lest
any
one
should
overhear
us
poor
sir
piers
he
dead
now
i
sure
you
both
loved
him
as
i
did
and
pity
and
pardon
him
if
he
was
guilty
for
certain
am
i
that
no
soul
ever
took
its
flight
more
heavily
laden
than
did
that
of
our
poor
friend
och
it
was
a
terrible
ending
but
you
shall
hear
he
died
and
judge
for
yourselves
when
i
returned
to
his
room
after
lady
rookwood
departure
i
found
him
quite
delirious
i
knew
death
was
not
far
off
then
one
minute
he
was
in
the
chase
cheering
on
the
hounds
tallyho
cried
he
clears
that
fence
who
swims
that
stream
the
next
he
was
drinking
carousing
and
hurrahing
at
the
head
of
his
table
hip
hip
as
mad
and
wild
and
frantic
as
ever
he
used
to
be
when
wine
had
got
the
better
of
him
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
in
the
midst
of
his
shouting
he
stopped
exclaiming
here
again
who
let
her
in
the
door
is
fast
i
locked
it
myself
devil
why
did
you
open
it
you
have
betrayed
me
she
will
poison
me
and
i
can
not
resist
ha
another
who
who
is
that
her
face
is
white
her
hair
hangs
about
her
shoulders
is
she
alive
again
susan
susan
why
that
look
you
loved
me
well
too
well
you
will
not
drag
me
to
perdition
you
will
not
appear
against
me
no
no
no
it
is
not

doted

whom
i
loved

but

repented

sorrowed

prayed

for
me

not
too
late

will
do
justice

all

and
ink

will
confess

sister

rookwood
i
shall
die
before
i
can
tell
it
come
hither
said
he
to
me
is
a
dark
dreadful
secret
on
my
mind
it
must
forth
tell
my
sister
no
my
senses
swim
susan
is
near
me
fury
in
her
eyes
avenging
fury
keep
her
off
what
is
this
white
mass
in
my
arms
what
do
i
hold
is
it
the
corpse
by
my
side
as
it
lay
that
long
long
night
it
is
it
is
cold
stiff
stirless
as
then
white
horribly
white
as
when
the
moon
that
would
not
set
showed
all
its
ghastliness
ah
it
moves
embraces
me
stifles
suffocates
me
help
remove
the
pillow
i
can
not
breathe
i
choke
oh
and
now
i
am
coming
to
the
strangest
part
of
my
story
and
strange
as
it
may
sound
every
word
is
as
true
as
gospel
ahem
coughed
small
well
at
this
moment
this
terrible
moment
what
should
i
hear
but
a
tap
against
the
wainscot
holy
virgin
how
it
startled
me
my
heart
leapt
to
my
mouth
in
an
instant
and
then
went
thump
thump
against
my
ribs
but
i
said
nothing
though
you
may
be
sure
i
kept
my
ears
wide
open
and
then
presently
i
heard
the
tap
repeated
somewhat
louder
and
shortly
afterwards
a
third
i
should
still
have
said
nothing
but
sir
piers
heard
the
knock
and
raised
himself
at
the
summons
as
if
it
had
been
the
last
trumpet
in
cried
he
in
a
dying
voice
and
heaven
forgive
me
if
i
confess
that
i
expected
a
certain
person
whose
company
one
would
rather
dispense
with
upon
such
an
occasion
to
step
in
however
though
it
was
the
ould
gentleman
it
was
somebody
near
akin
to
him
for
a
door
i
had
never
seen
and
never
even
dreamed
of
opened
in
the
wall
and
in
stepped
peter
bradley
ay
you
may
well
stare
gentlemen
but
it
was
peter
looking
as
stiff
as
a
crowbar
and
as
blue
as
a
mattock
well
he
walked
straight
up
to
the
bed
of
the
dying
man
and
bent
his
great
diabolical
gray
eyes
upon
him
laughing
all
the
while
yes
laughing
you
know
the
cursed
grin
he
has
to
proceed
have
called
me
said
he
to
sir
piers
am
here
what
would
you
with
me
are
not
alone
groaned
the
dying
man
us
tyrconnel
leave
me
for
five
minutes
only
five
mark
me
go
thinks
i
i
shall
never
see
you
again
alive
and
true
enough
it
was
i
never
did
see
him
again
with
breath
in
his
body
without
more
ado
i
left
him
and
i
had
scarcely
reached
the
corridor
when
i
heard
the
door
bolted
behind
me
i
then
stopped
to
listen
and
i
sure
not
blame
me
when
i
say
i
clapped
my
eye
to
the
keyhole
for
i
suspected
something
wrong
but
heaven
save
us
that
crafty
gravedigger
had
taken
his
precautions
too
well
i
could
neither
see
nor
hear
anything
except
after
a
few
minutes
a
wild
unearthly
screech
and
then
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
i
not
expecting
it
was
precipitated
head
foremost
into
the
room
to
the
great
damage
of
my
nose
when
i
got
up
peter
had
vanished
i
suppose
as
he
came
and
there
was
poor
sir
piers
leaning
back
upon
the
pillow
with
his
hands
stretched
out
as
if
in
supplication
his
eyes
unclosed
and
staring
and
his
limbs
stark
and
stiff
a
profound
silence
succeeded
this
narrative
coates
would
not
venture
upon
a
remark
small
seemed
for
some
minutes
lost
in
painful
reflection
at
length
he
spoke
you
have
described
a
shocking
scene
tyrconnel
and
in
a
manner
that
convinces
me
of
its
fidelity
but
i
trust
you
will
excuse
me
as
a
friend
of
the
late
sir
piers
in
requesting
you
to
maintain
silence
in
future
on
the
subject
its
repetition
can
be
productive
of
no
good
and
may
do
infinite
harm
by
giving
currency
to
unpleasant
reports
and
harrowing
the
feelings
of
the
survivors
every
one
acquainted
with
sir
piers
history
must
be
aware
as
i
dare
say
you
are
already
of
an
occurrence
which
cast
a
shade
over
his
early
life
blighted
his
character
and
endangered
his
personal
safety
it
was
a
dreadful
accusation
but
i
believe
nay
i
am
sure
it
was
unfounded
dark
suspicions
attach
to
a
romish
priest
of
the
name
of
checkley
he
i
believe
is
beyond
the
reach
of
human
justice
erring
sir
piers
was
undoubtedly
but
i
trust
he
was
more
weak
than
sinful
i
have
reason
to
think
he
was
the
tool
of
others
especially
of
the
wretch
i
have
named
and
it
is
easy
to
perceive
how
that
incomprehensible
lunatic
peter
bradley
has
obtained
an
ascendancy
over
him
his
daughter
you
are
aware
was
sir
piers
mistress
our
friend
is
now
gone
and
with
him
let
us
bury
his
offences
and
the
remembrance
of
them
that
his
soul
was
heavily
laden
would
appear
from
your
account
of
his
last
moments
yet
i
fervently
trust
that
his
repentance
was
sincere
in
which
case
there
is
hope
of
forgiveness
for
him
what
time
soever
a
sinner
shall
repent
him
of
his
sins
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
i
will
blot
out
all
his
wickedness
out
of
my
remembrance
saith
the
lord
heaven
mercy
is
greater
than
man
sins
and
there
is
hope
of
salvation
even
for
sir
piers
i
trust
so
indeed
said
titus
with
emotion
and
as
to
repeating
a
syllable
of
what
i
have
just
said
devil
a
word
more
will
i
utter
on
the
subject
my
lips
shall
be
shut
and
sealed
as
close
as
one
of
coates
bonds
for
ever
and
a
day
but
i
thought
it
just
right
to
make
you
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
and
now
having
dismissed
the
bad
for
ever
i
am
ready
to
speak
of
sir
piers
good
qualities
and
not
few
they
were
what
was
there
becoming
a
gentleman
that
he
could
do
like
to
know
could
he
hunt
as
well
as
ever
a
one
in
the
county
and
had
he
as
good
a
pack
of
hounds
could
he
shoot
as
well
and
fish
as
well
and
drink
as
well
or
better
only
he
could
carry
his
wine
which
was
his
misfortune
not
his
fault
and
was
he
always
ready
to
ask
a
friend
to
dinner
with
him
and
did
he
give
him
a
good
dinner
when
he
came
barring
the
afterwards
and
had
he
everything
agreeable
about
him
except
his
wife
which
was
a
great
drawback
and
with
all
his
peculiarities
and
humors
was
he
as
a
man
as
needs
be
and
an
irishman
at
the
core
and
so
if
he
wer
dead
i
say
long
life
to
him
but
as
he
is
here
peace
to
his
memory
at
this
juncture
a
knocking
was
heard
at
the
door
which
some
one
without
had
vainly
tried
to
open
titus
rose
to
unclose
it
ushering
in
an
individual
known
at
the
hall
as
jack
palmer
english
sure
the
captain
the
finest
gentleman
on
the
road
jack
palmer
was
a
man
with
immense
bushy
red
whiskers
a
freckled
florid
complexion
and
sandy
hair
rather
inclined
to
scantiness
towards
the
scalp
of
the
head
which
garnished
the
nape
of
his
neck
with
a
ruff
of
crisp
little
curls
like
the
ring
on
a
monk
shaven
crown
notwithstanding
this
tendency
to
baldness
jack
could
not
be
more
than
thirty
though
his
looks
were
some
five
years
in
advance
his
face
was
one
of
those
inexplicable
countenances
which
appear
to
be
proper
to
a
peculiar
class
of
men
a
regular
newmarket
physiognomy
compounded
chiefly
of
cunning
and
assurance
not
low
cunning
nor
vulgar
assurance
but
crafty
sporting
subtlety
careless
as
to
results
indifferent
to
obstacles
ever
on
the
alert
for
the
main
chance
game
and
turf
all
over
eager
yet
easy
keen
yet
quiet
he
was
somewhat
showily
dressed
in
such
wise
that
he
looked
half
like
a
fine
gentleman
of
that
day
half
like
a
jockey
of
our
own
his
nether
man
appeared
in
buckskins
and
boots
with
tops
not
unconscious
of
the
saddle
while
the
airy
extravagance
of
his
riding
coat
the
richness
of
his
vest
the
pockets
of
which
were
beautifully
exuberant
according
to
the
mode
of
the
smart
luxuriance
of
his
cravat
and
a
certain
curious
taste
in
the
size
and
style
of
his
buttons
proclaimed
that
in
his
own
esteem
at
least
his
person
did
not
appear
altogether
unworthy
of
decoration
nor
in
justice
to
jack
can
we
allow
that
he
was
in
error
he
was
a
model
of
a
man
for
five
feet
ten
square
compact
capitally
built
in
every
particular
excepting
that
his
legs
were
slightly
imbowed
which
defect
probably
arose
from
his
being
almost
constantly
on
horseback
a
sort
of
exercise
in
which
jack
greatly
delighted
and
was
accounted
a
superb
rider
it
was
indeed
his
daring
horsemanship
upon
one
particular
occasion
when
he
had
outstripped
a
whole
field
that
had
procured
him
the
honor
of
an
invitation
to
rookwood
who
he
was
or
whence
he
came
was
a
question
not
easily
answered
jack
himself
evading
all
solution
to
the
inquiry
sir
piers
never
troubled
his
head
about
the
matter
he
was
a
deuced
good
fellow
rode
well
and
stood
on
no
sort
of
ceremony
that
was
enough
for
him
nobody
else
knew
anything
about
him
save
that
he
was
a
capital
judge
of
horseflesh
kept
a
famous
black
mare
and
attended
every
hunt
in
the
west
riding
that
he
could
sing
a
good
song
was
a
choice
companion
and
could
drink
three
bottles
without
feeling
the
worse
for
them
sensible
of
the
indecorum
that
might
attach
to
his
appearance
small
had
hastily
laid
down
his
pipe
and
arranged
his
wig
but
when
he
saw
who
was
the
intruder
with
a
grunt
of
defiance
he
resumed
his
occupation
without
returning
the
bow
of
the
latter
or
bestowing
further
notice
upon
him
nothing
discomposed
at
the
displeasure
jack
greeted
titus
cordially
and
carelessly
saluting
coates
threw
himself
into
a
chair
he
next
filled
a
tumbler
of
claret
and
drained
it
at
a
draught
have
you
ridden
far
jack
asked
titus
noticing
the
dusty
state
of
palmer
azure
attire
some
dozen
miles
replied
palmer
and
that
on
such
a
sultry
afternoon
as
the
present
makes
one
feel
thirstyish
i
as
dry
as
a
sandbed
famous
wine
this
beautiful
tipple
better
than
all
your
red
fustian
ah
how
poor
sir
piers
used
to
like
it
well
that
all
over
a
glass
like
this
might
do
him
good
in
his
present
quarters
afraid
i
intruding
but
the
fact
is
i
wanted
a
little
information
about
the
order
of
the
procession
and
missing
you
below
came
hither
in
search
of
you
you
to
be
chief
mourner
i
suppose
titus
your
part
eh
come
come
jack
no
joking
replied
titus
the
subject
too
serious
i
am
to
be
chief
mourner
and
i
expect
you
to
be
a
mourner
and
everybody
else
to
be
mourners
we
must
all
mourn
at
the
proper
time
there
be
a
power
of
people
at
the
church
there
a
power
of
people
here
already
returned
jack
if
they
all
attend
and
they
all
attend
or
what
is
the
eating
and
drinking
to
go
for
i
leave
a
soul
in
the
house
excepting
one
said
jack
archly
lady
rookwood
wo
attend
i
think
ay
excepting
her
ladyship
and
her
ladyship
abigail
all
the
rest
go
with
me
and
form
part
of
the
procession
you
go
too
of
course
at
what
time
do
you
start
twelve
precisely
as
the
clock
strikes
we
set
out
all
in
a
line
and
a
long
line
we
make
i
waiting
for
that
ould
rascal
peter
bradley
to
arrange
the
order
how
long
will
it
all
occupy
think
you
asked
jack
carelessly
that
i
ca
say
returned
titus
possibly
an
hour
more
or
less
but
we
shall
start
to
the
minute
that
is
if
we
can
get
all
together
so
do
be
out
of
the
way
and
hark
ye
jack
you
must
contrive
to
change
your
toggery
that
coat
wo
do
it
not
the
thing
at
all
at
all
never
fear
that
replied
palmer
but
who
were
those
in
the
carriages
is
it
the
last
carriage
you
mean
squire
forester
and
his
sons
dining
with
the
other
gentlefolk
in
the
great
room
to
be
out
of
the
way
oh
we
have
a
grand
and
by
patrick
i
must
be
looking
after
it
stay
a
minute
said
jack
let
have
a
cool
bottle
first
they
are
all
taking
care
of
themselves
below
and
peter
bradley
has
not
made
his
appearance
so
you
need
be
in
no
hurry
i
go
with
you
presently
shall
i
ring
for
the
claret
by
all
means
replied
titus
jack
accordingly
arose
and
a
butler
answering
the
summons
a
bottle
was
soon
placed
before
them
you
heard
of
the
affray
last
night
i
presume
said
jack
renewing
the
conversation
with
the
poachers
to
be
sure
i
did
was
i
called
in
to
examine
hugh
badger
wounds
the
first
thing
this
morning
and
a
deep
cut
there
was
just
over
the
eye
besides
other
bruises
is
the
wound
dangerous
inquired
palmer
not
exactly
mortal
if
you
mean
that
replied
the
irishman
dangerous
certainly
humph
exclaimed
jack
they
a
pretty
hardish
bout
of
it
i
understand
anything
been
heard
of
the
body
what
body
inquired
small
who
was
the
body
of
the
drowned
poacher
replied
jack
they
were
off
to
search
for
it
this
morning
found
it
not
they
exclaimed
titus
ha
ha
i
ca
help
laughing
for
the
life
and
of
me
a
capital
trick
he
played
capital
ha
ha
what
do
you
think
the
fellow
did
ha
ha
after
leading
the
devil
dance
all
around
the
park
killing
a
hound
as
savage
as
a
wolf
and
breaking
hugh
badger
head
which
is
as
hard
and
thick
as
a
butcher
block
what
does
the
fellow
do
but
dive
into
a
pool
with
a
great
rock
hanging
over
it
and
make
his
way
to
the
other
side
through
a
subterranean
cavern
which
nobody
knew
anything
about
till
they
came
to
drag
it
thinking
him
snugly
drowned
all
the
while
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
chorused
jack
bravo
he
a
lad
of
the
right
sort
ha
ha
he
who
inquired
the
attorney
why
the
poacher
to
be
sure
replied
jack
who
else
were
we
talking
about
beg
pardon
returned
coates
i
thought
you
might
have
heard
some
intelligence
we
got
an
eye
upon
him
we
know
who
it
was
indeed
exclaimed
jack
and
who
was
it
a
fellow
known
by
the
name
of
luke
bradley
zounds
cried
titus
you
do
say
it
was
he
murder
in
irish
that
bates
everything
why
he
was
sir
piers
natural
son
replied
the
attorney
he
has
not
been
heard
of
for
some
time
shockingly
incorrigible
rascal
impossible
to
do
anything
with
him
you
do
say
so
observed
jack
i
heard
sir
piers
speak
of
the
lad
and
by
his
account
he
as
fine
a
fellow
as
ever
crossed
back
only
a
little
wildish
and
unreasonable
as
the
best
of
us
may
be
wants
breaking
that
all
your
skittish
colt
makes
the
best
horse
and
so
would
he
to
speak
the
truth
i
glad
he
escaped
so
am
i
rejoined
titus
for
in
the
first
place
i
a
foolish
partiality
for
poachers
and
am
sorry
when
any
of
come
to
hurt
and
in
the
second
i
be
mighty
displeased
if
any
ill
had
happened
to
one
of
sir
piers
flesh
and
blood
as
this
young
chap
appears
to
be
appears
to
be
repeated
palmer
there
no
in
the
case
i
take
it
this
bradley
an
undoubted
offshoot
of
the
old
squire
his
mother
was
a
at
the
hall
i
rather
think
you
sir
continued
he
addressing
coates
perhaps
can
inform
us
of
the
real
facts
of
the
case
she
was
something
better
than
a
servant
replied
the
attorney
with
a
slight
cough
and
a
knowing
wink
i
remember
her
quite
well
though
i
was
but
a
boy
then
a
lovely
creature
and
so
taking
i
do
wonder
that
sir
piers
was
smitten
with
her
he
was
mad
after
the
women
in
those
days
and
pretty
sue
bradley
above
all
others
she
lived
with
him
quite
like
his
lady
so
i
heard
returned
jack
and
she
remained
with
him
till
her
death
let
me
see
was
there
something
rather
odd
in
the
way
in
which
she
died
rather
suddenish
and
unexpected
a
noise
made
about
it
at
the
time
eh
not
that
i
ever
heard
replied
coates
shaking
his
head
and
appearing
to
be
afflicted
with
an
instantaneous
ignorance
while
titus
affected
not
to
hear
the
remark
but
occupied
himself
with
his
small
snored
audibly
i
was
too
young
then
to
pay
any
attention
to
idle
rumors
continued
coates
it
a
long
time
ago
may
i
ask
the
reason
of
your
inquiry
nothing
further
than
simple
curiosity
replied
jack
enjoying
the
consternation
of
his
companions
it
is
as
you
say
a
long
while
since
but
it
singular
how
that
sort
of
thing
is
remembered
one
would
think
people
had
something
else
to
do
than
talk
of
one
private
affairs
for
ever
for
my
part
i
despise
such
tattle
but
there
persons
in
the
neighborhood
who
still
say
it
was
an
awkward
business
amongst
others
i
heard
that
this
very
luke
bradley
talks
in
pretty
plain
terms
about
it
does
he
indeed
said
coates
so
much
the
worse
for
him
let
me
once
lay
hands
upon
him
and
i
put
a
gag
in
his
mouth
that
shall
spoil
his
talking
in
the
future
that
precisely
the
point
i
desire
to
arrive
at
replied
jack
and
i
advise
you
by
all
means
to
accomplish
that
for
the
sake
of
the
family
nobody
likes
his
friends
to
be
talked
about
so
i
settle
the
matter
amicably
were
i
you
just
let
the
fellow
go
his
way
he
wo
return
here
again
in
a
hurry
i
be
bound
as
to
clapping
him
in
quod
he
might
prattle
turn
stag
turn
stag
replied
coates
what
the
deuce
is
that
in
my
opinion
he
has
stag
already
at
all
events
he
pay
for
his
night
sport
you
may
depend
upon
it
what
signifies
it
what
says
let
me
lay
hands
upon
him
that
all
well
well
said
jack
no
offence
i
only
meant
to
offer
a
suggestion
i
thought
the
family
young
sir
ranulph
i
mean
like
the
story
to
be
revived
as
to
lady
rookwood
she
do
i
suppose
care
much
about
idle
reports
indeed
if
i
been
rightly
informed
she
bears
this
youngster
no
particular
to
begin
with
and
has
tried
hard
to
get
him
out
of
the
country
but
as
you
say
what
it
signify
what
he
says
he
can
talk
sir
piers
is
dead
and
gone
humph
muttered
coates
peevishly
but
it
does
seem
a
little
hard
that
a
lad
should
swing
for
killing
a
bit
of
venison
in
his
own
father
park
which
he
a
right
to
do
cried
titus
he
had
no
natural
right
to
bruise
violently
assault
and
endanger
the
life
of
his
father
or
anybody
else
gamekeeper
retorted
coates
i
tell
you
sir
he
committed
a
capital
offence
and
if
he
taken
no
chance
of
that
i
hope
interrupted
jack
that
a
wish
i
ca
help
wishing
myself
said
titus
on
my
conscience
these
poachers
are
fine
boys
when
all
said
and
done
the
finest
of
all
boys
exclaimed
jack
with
a
kindred
enthusiasm
are
those
birds
of
the
night
and
minions
of
the
moon
whom
we
call
most
unjustly
poachers
they
are
after
all
only
making
a
business
of
what
we
make
a
pleasure
a
nightly
pursuit
of
what
is
to
us
a
daily
relaxation
there
the
main
distinction
as
to
the
rest
it
all
in
idea
they
merely
thin
an
overstocked
park
as
would
reduce
a
plethoric
patient
doctor
or
as
would
work
a
moneyed
client
if
you
got
him
into
chancery
mister
attorney
and
then
how
much
more
scientifically
and
systematically
they
set
to
work
than
we
amateurs
do
how
noiselessly
they
bag
a
hare
smoke
a
pheasant
or
knock
a
buck
down
with
an
how
independent
are
they
of
any
license
except
that
of
a
good
eye
and
a
swift
pair
of
legs
how
unnecessary
is
it
for
them
to
ask
permission
to
shoot
over
grounds
or
my
lord
that
preserves
they
are
free
of
every
cover
and
indifferent
to
any
alteration
in
the
game
laws
i
some
thoughts
when
everything
else
fails
of
taking
to
poaching
myself
in
my
opinion
a
poacher
a
highly
respectable
character
what
say
you
mr
coates
turning
very
gravely
to
that
gentleman
such
a
question
sir
replied
coates
bridling
up
scarcely
deserves
a
serious
answer
i
make
no
doubt
you
will
next
maintain
that
a
highwayman
is
a
gentleman
most
undoubtedly
replied
palmer
in
the
same
grave
tone
which
might
have
passed
for
banter
had
jack
ever
bantered
i
maintain
and
prove
it
i
do
see
how
he
can
be
otherwise
it
is
as
necessary
for
a
man
to
be
a
gentleman
before
he
can
turn
highwayman
as
it
is
for
a
doctor
to
have
his
diploma
or
an
attorney
his
certificate
some
of
the
finest
gentlemen
of
their
day
as
captain
lovelace
hind
hannum
and
dudley
were
eminent
on
the
road
and
they
set
the
fashion
ever
since
their
day
a
real
highwayman
would
consider
himself
disgraced
if
he
did
not
conduct
himself
in
every
way
like
a
gentleman
of
course
there
are
pretenders
in
this
line
as
in
everything
else
but
these
are
only
exceptions
and
prove
the
rule
what
are
the
distinguishing
characteristics
of
a
fine
gentleman
perfect
knowledge
of
the
world
perfect
independence
of
character
notoriety
command
of
cash
and
inordinate
success
with
the
women
you
grant
all
these
premises
first
then
it
is
part
of
a
highwayman
business
to
be
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
world
he
is
the
easiest
and
pleasantest
fellow
going
there
is
tom
king
for
example
he
is
the
handsomest
man
about
town
and
the
fellow
on
the
road
then
whose
inclinations
are
so
uncontrolled
as
the
highwayman
so
long
as
the
mopuses
last
who
produces
so
great
an
effect
by
so
few
words
and
deliver
is
sure
to
arrest
attention
every
one
is
captivated
by
an
address
so
as
to
money
he
wins
a
purse
of
a
hundred
guineas
as
easily
as
you
would
the
same
sum
from
the
faro
table
and
wherein
lies
the
difference
only
in
the
name
of
the
game
who
so
little
need
of
a
banker
as
he
all
he
has
to
apprehend
is
a
check
all
he
has
to
draw
is
a
trigger
as
to
the
women
they
dote
upon
him
not
even
your
is
so
successful
look
at
a
highwayman
mounted
on
his
flying
steed
with
his
pistols
in
his
holsters
and
his
mask
upon
his
face
what
can
be
a
more
gallant
sight
the
clatter
of
his
horse
heels
is
like
music
to
his
ear
he
is
in
full
quest
he
shouts
to
the
fugitive
horseman
to
stay
the
other
flies
all
the
faster
what
chase
can
be
half
so
exciting
as
that
suppose
he
overtakes
his
prey
which
ten
to
one
he
will
how
readily
his
summons
to
deliver
is
obeyed
how
satisfactory
is
the
appropriation
of
a
lusty
purse
or
corpulent
getting
the
brush
is
nothing
to
it
how
tranquilly
he
departs
takes
off
his
hat
to
his
accommodating
acquaintance
wishes
him
a
pleasant
journey
and
disappears
across
the
heath
england
sir
has
reason
to
be
proud
of
her
highwaymen
they
are
peculiar
to
her
clime
and
are
as
much
before
the
brigand
of
italy
the
contrabandist
of
spain
or
the
of
france
as
her
sailors
are
before
all
the
rest
of
the
world
the
day
will
never
come
i
hope
when
we
shall
degenerate
into
the
footpad
and
lose
our
even
the
french
borrow
from
us
they
have
only
one
highwayman
of
eminence
and
he
learnt
and
practised
his
art
in
england
and
who
was
he
may
i
ask
said
coates
claude
replied
jack
and
though
a
frenchman
he
was
a
deuced
fine
fellow
in
his
day
quite
a
macaroni
he
could
skip
and
twirl
like
a
figurant
warble
like
an
and
play
the
flageolet
better
than
any
man
of
his
day
he
always
carried
a
lute
in
his
pocket
along
with
his
snappers
and
then
his
dress
it
was
quite
beautiful
to
see
how
smartly
he
was
rigg
out
all
velvet
and
lace
and
even
with
his
vizard
on
his
face
the
ladies
used
to
cry
out
to
see
him
then
he
took
a
purse
with
the
air
and
grace
of
a
all
the
women
adored
him
and
that
bless
their
pretty
faces
was
the
best
proof
of
his
gentility
i
wish
he
not
been
a
mounseer
the
women
never
mistake
can
always
discover
the
true
gentlemen
and
they
were
all
of
every
degree
from
the
countess
to
the
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
him
but
he
was
taken
i
suppose
asked
coates
ay
responded
jack
the
women
were
his
undoing
as
they
been
many
a
brave
fellow
before
and
will
be
again
touched
by
which
reflection
jack
became
for
once
in
his
life
sentimental
and
sighed
poor
he
was
seized
at
the
in
by
the
bailiff
of
westminster
when
dead
drunk
his
liquor
having
been
drugged
by
his
dells
and
was
shortly
afterwards
hanged
at
tyburn
it
was
thousand
pities
said
coates
with
a
sneer
that
so
fine
a
gentleman
should
come
to
so
ignominious
an
end
quite
the
contrary
returned
jack
as
his
biographer
doctor
pope
properly
remarks
is
there
worthy
of
the
name
of
man
that
would
not
prefer
such
a
death
before
a
mean
solitary
inglorious
life
titus
as
we
upon
the
subject
if
you
like
i
sing
you
a
song
about
highwaymen
i
should
like
it
of
all
things
replied
titus
who
entertained
a
very
favorable
opinion
of
jack
vocal
powers
and
was
by
no
means
an
indifferent
performer
only
let
it
be
in
a
minor
key
jack
required
no
further
encouragement
but
disregarding
the
hints
and
looks
of
coates
sang
with
much
unction
the
following
ballad
to
a
good
old
tune
then
very
popular
the
merit
of
which
nobody
can
deny
a
chapter
of
highwaymen
of
every
rascal
of
every
kind
the
most
notorious
to
my
mind
was
the
cavalier
captain
gay
jemmy
hind
nobody
can
but
the
pleasantest
coxcomb
among
them
all
for
lute
coranto
and
madrigal
was
the
galliard
frenchman
claude
nobody
can
and
tobygloak
never
a
coach
could
rob
could
lighten
a
pocket
or
empty
a
fob
with
a
neater
hand
than
old
mob
old
mob
nobody
can
nor
did
housebreaker
ever
deal
harder
knocks
on
the
stubborn
lid
of
a
good
strong
box
than
that
prince
of
good
fellows
tom
cox
tom
cox
nobody
can
a
blither
fellow
on
broad
highway
did
never
with
oath
bid
traveller
stay
than
will
holloway
nobody
can
and
in
roguery
naught
could
exceed
the
tricks
of
gettings
and
grey
and
the
five
or
six
who
trod
in
the
steps
of
bold
neddy
wicks
nobody
can
nor
could
any
so
handily
break
a
lock
as
sheppard
who
stood
on
the
newgate
dock
and
nicknamed
the
jailers
around
him
nobody
can
nor
did
highwaymen
ever
before
possess
for
ease
for
security
danger
distress
such
a
mare
as
dick
turpin
black
bess
black
bess
nobody
can
a
capital
song
by
the
powers
cried
titus
as
jack
ditty
came
to
a
close
but
your
english
robbers
are
nothing
at
all
compared
with
our
tories
and
rapparees
nothing
at
all
they
were
the
gentlemen
they
were
the
boys
to
cut
a
throat
pshaw
exclaimed
jack
in
disgust
the
gentlemen
i
speak
of
never
maltreated
any
one
except
in
maybe
not
replied
titus
i
not
dispute
the
point
but
these
rapparees
were
true
brothers
of
the
blade
and
gentlemen
every
inch
i
just
sing
you
a
song
i
made
about
them
myself
but
meanwhile
let
forget
the
bottle
talking
dry
work
my
service
to
you
doctor
added
he
winking
at
the
somnolent
small
and
tossing
off
his
glass
titus
delivered
himself
with
much
joviality
of
the
following
ballad
the
words
of
which
he
adapted
to
the
tune
of
the
of
the
the
rapparees
let
the
englishman
boast
of
his
turpins
and
sheppards
as
cocks
of
the
walk
his
mulsacks
and
cheneys
and
swiftnecks
it
all
botheration
and
talk
compared
with
the
robbers
of
ireland
they
do
come
within
half
a
mile
there
never
were
yet
any
rascals
like
those
of
my
own
native
isle
first
and
foremost
comes
redmond
allowed
the
first
thief
of
the
world
that
the
broad
province
of
ulster
the
rapparee
banner
unfurled
och
he
was
an
elegant
fellow
as
ever
you
saw
in
your
life
at
fingering
the
blunderbuss
trigger
or
handling
the
knife
and
then
such
a
squadron
as
that
which
composed
meel
mactigh
jack
reilly
shan
bernagh
phil
galloge
and
arthur
never
were
any
boys
like
for
rows
and
sprees
not
a
did
they
leave
in
the
country
and
hence
they
were
called
next
comes
power
the
great
tory
of
munster
a
gentleman
born
every
inch
and
strong
jack
macpherson
of
leinster
a
who
broke
at
a
pinch
the
last
was
a
fellow
so
not
death
his
courage
could
damp
for
as
he
was
led
to
the
gallows
he
played
his
own
march
to
the
camp
paddy
fleming
dick
balf
and
mulhoni
i
think
are
the
next
on
my
list
all
adepts
in
the
beautiful
science
of
giving
a
pocket
a
twist
jemmy
carrick
must
follow
his
leaders
purney
who
put
in
a
huff
by
dancing
a
hornpipe
at
tyburn
and
bothering
the
hangman
for
snuff
there
paul
liddy
the
tory
whose
noddle
was
stuck
on
a
spike
and
billy
delaney

never
shall
meet

a
witch
was
anointed
and
warranted
safe
by
her
charm
no
hemp
that
was
ever
yet
twisted
his
wonderful
throttle
could
harm
and
lastly
there
cahir
na
cappul
the
handiest
rogue
of
them
all
who
only
need
whisper
a
word
and
your
horse
will
trot
out
of
his
stall
your
tit
is
not
safe
in
your
stable
though
you
or
your
groom
should
be
near
and
devil
a
bit
in
the
paddock
if
cahir
gets
of
his
ear
then
success
to
the
tories
of
ireland
the
generous
the
gallant
the
gay
with
them
the
best
of
england
are
not
to
be
named
the
same
day
and
were
further
proof
wanting
to
show
what
precedence
we
take
with
our
recollect
that
robbers
are
tories
while
those
of
country
are
whigs
bravissimo
cried
jack
drumming
upon
the
table
well
said
coates
we
had
enough
about
the
irish
highwaymen
in
all
conscience
but
there
a
rascal
on
our
side
of
the
channel
whom
you
have
only
incidentally
mentioned
and
who
makes
more
noise
than
them
all
put
together
who
that
asked
jack
with
some
curiosity
dick
turpin
replied
the
attorney
he
seems
to
me
quite
as
worthy
of
mention
as
any
of
the
hinds
the
or
the
you
have
either
of
you
enumerated
i
did
not
think
of
him
replied
palmer
smiling
though
if
i
had
he
scarcely
deserves
to
be
ranked
with
those
illustrious
heroes
gads
bobs
cried
titus
they
tell
me
turpin
keeps
the
best
nag
in
the
united
kingdom
and
can
ride
faster
and
further
in
a
day
than
any
other
man
in
a
week
so
i
heard
said
palmer
with
a
glance
of
satisfaction
i
should
like
to
try
a
run
with
him
i
warrant
me
i
not
be
far
behind
i
should
like
to
get
a
peep
at
him
quoth
titus
so
should
i
added
coates
vastly
you
may
both
of
you
be
gratified
gentlemen
said
palmer
talking
of
dick
turpin
they
say
is
like
speaking
of
the
devil
he
at
your
elbow
ere
the
word
well
out
of
your
mouth
he
may
be
within
hearing
at
this
moment
for
anything
we
know
to
the
contrary
body
o
me
ejaculated
coates
you
do
say
so
turpin
in
yorkshire
i
thought
he
confined
his
exploits
to
the
neighborhood
of
the
metropolis
and
made
epping
forest
his
headquarters
so
he
did
replied
jack
but
the
cave
is
all
up
now
the
whole
of
the
great
north
road
from
tottenham
cross
to
york
gates
comes
within
dick
present
range
and
saint
nicholas
only
knows
in
which
part
of
it
he
is
most
likely
to
be
found
he
shifts
his
quarters
as
often
and
as
readily
as
a
tartar
and
he
who
looks
for
him
may
chance
to
catch
a
tartar
ha
ha
it
a
disgrace
to
the
country
that
such
a
rascal
should
remain
unhanged
returned
coates
peevishly
government
ought
to
look
to
it
is
the
whole
kingdom
to
be
kept
in
a
state
of
agitation
by
a
single
highwayman
sir
robert
walpole
should
take
the
affair
into
his
own
hands
fudge
exclaimed
jack
emptying
his
glass
i
have
already
addressed
a
letter
to
the
editor
of
the
on
the
subject
said
coates
in
which
i
have
spoken
my
mind
pretty
plainly
and
i
repeat
it
is
perfectly
disgraceful
that
such
a
rascal
should
be
suffered
to
remain
at
large
you
do
happen
to
have
that
letter
by
you
i
suppose
said
jack
or
i
should
beg
the
favor
to
hear
it
i
am
not
acquainted
with
the
newspaper
to
which
you
allude
i
read
so
i
thought
replied
coates
with
a
sneer
that
the
reason
you
are
so
easily
mystified
but
luckily
i
have
the
paper
in
my
pocket
and
you
are
quite
welcome
to
my
opinions
here
it
is
added
he
drawing
forth
a
newspaper
i
shall
waive
my
preliminary
remarks
and
come
to
the
point
at
once
by
all
means
said
jack
thank
god
began
coates
in
an
authoritative
tone
i
was
born
in
a
country
that
hath
formerly
emulated
the
romans
in
their
public
spirit
as
is
evident
from
their
conquests
abroad
and
their
struggles
for
liberty
at
home
what
has
all
this
got
to
do
with
turpin
interposed
jack
you
will
hear
replied
the
attorney
no
interruptions
if
you
please
this
noble
principle
continued
he
with
great
emphasis
not
utterly
lost
i
can
not
think
at
present
so
active
as
it
ought
to
be
in
a
nation
so
jealous
of
her
liberty
good
exclaimed
jack
there
is
more
than
in
that
observation
mr
coates
suspicion
proceeded
coates
founded
on
a
late
instance
i
mean
the
flagrant
undisturbed
success
of
the
notorious
turpin
who
hath
robb
in
a
manner
scarce
ever
known
before
for
several
years
and
is
grown
so
insolent
and
impudent
as
to
threaten
particular
persons
and
become
openly
dangerous
to
the
lives
as
well
as
fortunes
of
the
people
of
england
better
and
better
shouted
jack
laughing
immoderately
pray
go
on
sir
a
fellow
continued
coates
is
known
to
be
a
thief
by
the
whole
kingdom
shall
for
so
long
a
time
continue
to
rob
us
and
not
only
rob
us
but
make
a
jest
of
us
ha
ha
ha
capital
excuse
me
sir
roared
jack
laughing
till
the
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
pray
pray
go
on
i
see
nothing
to
laugh
at
replied
coates
somewhat
offended
however
i
will
conclude
my
letter
since
i
have
begun
it
only
rob
us
but
make
a
jest
of
us
shall
defy
the
laws
and
laugh
at
justice
argues
a
want
of
public
spirit
which
should
make
every
particular
member
of
the
community
sensible
of
the
public
calamity
and
ambitious
of
the
honor
of
extirpating
such
a
notorious
highwayman
from
society
since
he
owes
his
long
successes
to
no
other
cause
than
his
immoderate
impudence
and
the
sloth
and
pusillanimity
of
those
who
ought
to
bring
him
to
justice
i
will
not
deny
continued
coates
that
professing
myself
as
i
do
to
be
a
staunch
new
whig
i
had
not
some
covert
political
object
in
penning
this
epistle
nevertheless
setting
aside
my
principles
right
observed
jack
you
whigs
new
or
old
always
set
aside
your
principles
setting
aside
any
political
feeling
i
may
entertain
continued
coates
disregarding
the
interruption
i
repeat
i
am
ambitious
of
extirpating
this
modern
cacus
this
autolycus
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
what
course
do
you
mean
to
pursue
asked
jack
for
i
suppose
you
do
not
expect
to
catch
this
as
you
call
him
by
a
line
in
the
newspapers
i
am
in
the
habit
of
keeping
my
own
counsel
sir
replied
coates
pettishly
and
to
be
plain
with
you
i
hope
to
finger
all
the
reward
myself
oons
is
there
a
reward
offered
for
turpin
apprehension
asked
titus
no
less
than
two
hundred
pounds
answered
coates
and
that
no
trifle
as
you
will
both
admit
have
you
not
seen
the
proclamation
mr
palmer
not
i
replied
jack
with
affected
indifference
nor
i
added
titus
with
some
appearance
of
curiosity
do
you
happen
to
have
by
you
too
i
always
carry
it
about
with
me
replied
coates
that
i
may
refer
to
it
in
case
of
emergency
my
father
christopher
or
kit
coates
as
he
was
familiarly
called
was
a
celebrated
he
apprehended
spicket
and
child
and
half
a
dozen
others
and
always
kept
their
descriptions
in
his
pocket
i
endeavor
to
tread
in
my
worthy
footsteps
i
hope
to
signalize
myself
by
capturing
a
highwayman
added
he
surveying
jack
more
narrowly
it
occurs
to
me
that
turpin
must
be
rather
like
you
mr
palmer
like
me
said
jack
regarding
coates
askance
like
me
how
am
i
to
understand
you
sir
eh
no
offence
none
whatever
sir
ah
stay
you
wo
object
to
my
comparing
the
description
that
do
no
harm
nobody
would
take
you
for
a
highwayman
nobody
whatever
ha
ha
singular
resemblance
he
he
these
things
happen
sometimes
not
very
often
though
but
here
is
turpin
description
in
the
having
been
represented
to
the
king
that
richard
turpin
did
on
wednesday
the
of
may
last
rob
on
his
majesty
highway
vavasour
mowbray
major
of
the
troop
of
horse
that
major
mowbray
is
a
nephew
of
the
late
sir
piers
and
cousin
of
the
present
baronet
commit
other
notorious
felonies
and
robberies
near
london
his
majesty
is
pleased
to
promise
his
most
gracious
pardon
to
any
of
his
accomplices
and
a
reward
of
two
hundred
pounds
to
any
person
or
persons
who
shall
discover
him
so
as
he
may
be
apprehended
and
odsbodikins
exclaimed
titus
a
noble
reward
i
should
like
to
lay
hands
upon
turpin
added
he
slapping
palmer
shoulder
i
wish
he
were
in
your
place
at
this
moment
jack
thank
you
replied
palmer
shifting
his
chair
continued
coates
born
at
thacksted
in
essex
is
about
you
sir
i
believe
are
about
thirty
added
he
addressing
palmer
thereabouts
said
jack
bluffly
but
what
has
my
age
to
do
with
that
of
turpin
nothing
nothing
at
all
answered
coates
suffer
me
however
to
proceed
by
trade
a
you
sir
i
believe
never
had
any
dealings
in
that
line
i
have
some
notion
how
to
dispose
of
a
troublesome
calf
returned
jack
but
turpin
though
described
as
a
butcher
is
i
understand
a
lineal
descendant
of
a
great
french
archbishop
of
the
same
name
who
wrote
the
chronicles
of
that
royal
robber
charlemagne
i
know
him
replied
coates
a
terrible
liar
the
modern
turpin
about
five
feet
nine
inches
exactly
your
height
sir
exactly
i
am
five
feet
ten
answered
jack
standing
bolt
upright
you
have
an
inch
then
in
your
favor
returned
the
unperturbed
attorney
deliberately
proceeding
with
his
examination
has
a
brown
complexion
marked
with
the
my
complexion
is
florid
my
face
without
a
seam
quoth
jack
those
whiskers
would
conceal
anything
replied
coates
with
a
grin
nobody
wears
whiskers
nowadays
except
a
highwayman
sir
said
jack
sternly
you
are
personal
i
do
mean
to
be
so
replied
coates
but
you
must
allow
the
description
tallies
with
your
own
in
a
remarkable
manner
hear
me
out
however
cheek
bones
are
broad
his
face
is
thinner
towards
the
bottom
his
visage
short
pretty
upright
and
broad
about
the
now
i
appeal
to
tyrconnel
if
all
this
does
not
sound
like
a
portrait
of
yourself
do
appeal
to
me
said
titus
hastily
upon
such
a
delicate
point
i
ca
say
that
i
approve
of
a
gentleman
being
likened
to
a
highwayman
but
if
ever
there
was
a
highwayman
i
wish
to
resemble
it
either
redmond
or
richard
turpin
and
may
the
devil
burn
me
if
i
know
which
of
the
two
is
the
greater
rascal
well
palmer
said
coates
i
repeat
i
mean
no
offence
likenesses
are
unaccountable
i
am
said
to
be
like
my
lord
north
whether
i
am
or
not
the
lord
knows
but
if
ever
i
meet
with
turpin
i
shall
bear
you
in
mind
he
he
ah
if
ever
i
have
the
good
luck
to
stumble
upon
him
i
a
plan
for
his
capture
which
fail
only
let
me
get
a
glimpse
of
him
that
all
you
shall
see
how
i
dispose
of
him
well
sir
we
see
observed
palmer
and
for
your
own
sake
i
wish
you
may
never
be
nearer
to
him
than
you
are
at
this
moment
with
his
friends
they
say
dick
turpin
can
be
as
gentle
as
a
lamb
with
his
foes
especially
with
a
limb
of
the
law
like
yourself
he
been
found
but
an
ugly
customer
i
once
saw
him
at
newmarket
where
he
was
collared
by
two
constable
culls
one
on
each
side
shaking
off
one
and
dealing
the
other
a
blow
in
the
face
with
his
whip
he
stuck
spurs
into
his
mare
and
though
the
whole
field
gave
chase
he
distanced
them
all
easily
and
how
came
you
not
to
try
your
pace
with
him
if
you
were
there
as
you
boasted
a
short
time
ago
asked
coates
so
i
did
and
stuck
closer
to
him
than
any
one
else
we
were
neck
and
neck
i
was
the
only
person
who
could
have
delivered
him
to
the
hands
of
justice
if
i
felt
inclined
zounds
cried
coates
if
i
had
a
similar
opportunity
it
should
be
neck
or
nothing
either
he
or
i
should
reach
the
first
i
take
him
dead
or
alive
take
turpin
cried
jack
with
a
sneer
i
engage
to
do
it
replied
coates
i
bet
you
a
hundred
guineas
i
take
him
if
i
ever
have
the
same
chance
done
exclaimed
jack
rapping
the
table
at
the
same
time
so
that
the
glasses
danced
upon
it
that
right
cried
titus
i
go
you
halves
what
the
matter
what
the
matter
exclaimed
small
awakened
from
his
doze
only
a
trifling
bet
about
a
highwayman
replied
titus
a
highwayman
echoed
small
eh
what
there
are
none
in
the
house
i
hope
i
hope
not
answered
coates
but
this
gentleman
has
taken
up
the
defence
of
the
notorious
dick
turpin
in
so
singular
a
manner
that
factu
fœdum
est
idem
est
et
dictu
returned
small
the
less
said
about
that
rascal
the
better
so
i
think
replied
jack
the
fact
is
as
you
say
sir
were
dick
here
he
would
i
am
sure
take
the
to
hide
further
discourse
was
cut
short
by
the
sudden
opening
of
the
door
followed
by
the
abrupt
entrance
of
a
tall
slender
young
man
who
hastily
advanced
towards
the
table
around
which
the
company
were
seated
his
appearance
excited
the
utmost
astonishment
in
the
whole
group
curiosity
was
exhibited
in
every
countenance
the
magnum
remained
poised
midway
in
the
hand
of
palmer
small
scorched
his
thumb
in
the
bowl
of
his
pipe
and
coates
was
almost
choked
by
swallowing
an
inordinate
whiff
of
vapor
young
sir
ranulph
ejaculated
he
as
soon
as
the
syncope
would
permit
him
sir
ranulph
here
echoed
palmer
rising
angels
and
ministers
exclaimed
small
odsbodikins
cried
titus
with
a
theatrical
start
this
is
more
than
i
expected
gentlemen
said
ranulph
do
not
let
my
unexpected
arrival
here
discompose
you
small
you
will
excuse
the
manner
of
my
greeting
and
you
coates
one
of
the
present
party
i
believe
was
my
father
medical
attendant
dr
tyrconnel
i
had
that
honor
replied
the
irishman
bowing
profoundly
i
am
tyrconnel
sir
ranulph
at
your
service
when
and
at
what
hour
did
my
father
breathe
his
last
sir
inquired
ranulph
poor
sir
piers
answered
titus
again
bowing
departed
this
life
on
thursday
last
the
hour
the
precise
minute
asked
ranulph
eagerly
troth
sir
ranulph
as
nearly
as
i
can
recollect
it
might
be
a
few
minutes
before
midnight
the
very
hour
exclaimed
ranulph
striding
towards
the
window
his
steps
were
arrested
as
his
eye
fell
upon
the
attire
of
his
father
which
as
we
have
before
noticed
hung
at
that
end
of
the
room
a
slight
shudder
passed
over
his
frame
there
was
a
momentary
pause
during
which
ranulph
continued
gazing
intently
at
the
apparel
the
very
dress
too
muttered
he
then
turning
to
the
assembly
who
were
watching
his
movements
with
surprise
doctor
said
he
addressing
small
i
have
something
for
your
private
ear
gentlemen
will
you
spare
us
the
room
for
a
few
minutes
on
my
conscience
said
tyrconnel
to
jack
palmer
as
they
quitted
the
sanctum
a
mighty
fine
boy
is
this
young
sir
ranulph
and
a
chip
of
the
ould
block
he
be
as
good
a
fellow
as
his
father
no
doubt
replied
palmer
shutting
the
door
but
what
the
devil
brought
him
back
just
in
the
nick
of
it
yes
francisco
he
hath
left
his
curse
upon
me
how
his
curse
i
dost
comprehend
what
that
word
carries
shot
from
a
father
angry
breath
unless
i
tear
poor
felisarda
from
my
heart
he
hath
pronounced
me
heir
to
all
his
curses
shirley
there
is
nothing
i
trust
my
dear
young
friend
and
quondam
pupil
said
small
as
the
door
was
closed
that
weighs
upon
your
mind
beyond
the
sorrow
naturally
incident
to
an
affliction
severe
as
the
present
forgive
my
apprehensions
if
i
am
wrong
you
know
the
affectionate
interest
i
have
ever
felt
for
you
an
interest
which
i
assure
you
is
nowise
diminished
and
which
will
excuse
my
urging
you
to
unburden
your
mind
to
me
assuring
yourself
that
whatever
may
be
your
disclosure
you
will
have
my
sincere
sympathy
and
commiseration
i
may
be
better
able
to
advise
with
you
should
counsel
be
necessary
than
others
from
my
knowledge
of
your
character
and
temperament
i
would
not
anticipate
evil
and
am
perhaps
unnecessarily
apprehensive
but
i
own
i
am
startled
at
the
incoherence
of
your
expressions
coupled
with
your
sudden
and
almost
mysterious
appearance
at
this
distressing
conjuncture
answer
me
has
your
return
been
the
result
of
mere
accident
is
it
to
be
considered
one
of
those
singular
circumstances
which
almost
look
like
fate
and
baffle
our
comprehension
or
were
you
nearer
home
than
we
expected
and
received
the
news
of
your
father
demise
through
some
channel
unknown
to
us
satisfy
my
curiosity
i
beg
of
you
upon
this
point
your
curiosity
my
dear
sir
replied
ranulph
gravely
and
sadly
will
not
be
decreased
when
i
tell
you
that
my
return
has
neither
been
the
work
of
chance
for
i
came
fully
anticipating
the
dread
event
which
i
find
realized
nor
has
it
been
occasioned
by
any
intelligence
derived
from
yourself
or
others
it
was
only
indeed
upon
my
arrival
here
that
i
received
full
confirmation
of
my
apprehensions
i
had
another
a
more
terrible
summons
to
return
what
summons
you
perplex
me
exclaimed
small
gazing
with
some
misgiving
into
the
face
of
his
young
friend
i
am
myself
perplexed
sorely
perplexed
returned
ranulph
i
have
much
to
relate
but
i
pray
you
bear
with
me
to
the
end
i
have
that
on
my
mind
which
like
guilt
must
be
revealed
speak
then
fearlessly
to
me
said
small
affectionately
pressing
ranulph
hand
and
assure
yourself
beforehand
of
my
sympathy
it
will
be
necessary
said
ranulph
to
preface
my
narrative
by
some
slight
allusion
to
certain
painful
events
and
yet
i
know
not
why
i
should
call
them
painful
excepting
in
their
consequences
which
influenced
my
conduct
in
my
final
interview
between
my
father
and
myself
an
interview
which
occasioned
my
departure
for
the
continent
and
which
was
of
a
character
so
dreadful
that
i
would
not
even
revert
to
it
were
it
not
a
necessary
preliminary
to
the
circumstance
i
am
about
to
detail
when
i
left
oxford
i
passed
a
few
weeks
alone
in
london
a
college
friend
whom
i
accidentally
met
introduced
me
during
a
promenade
in
james
park
to
some
acquaintances
of
his
own
who
were
taking
an
airing
in
the
mall
at
the
same
time
a
family
whose
name
was
mowbray
consisting
of
a
widow
lady
her
son
and
daughter
this
introduction
was
made
in
compliance
with
my
own
request
i
had
been
struck
by
the
singular
beauty
of
the
younger
lady
whose
countenance
had
a
peculiar
and
inexpressible
charm
to
me
from
its
marked
resemblance
to
the
portrait
of
the
lady
eleanor
rookwood
whose
charms
and
unhappy
fate
i
have
so
often
dwelt
upon
and
deplored
the
picture
is
there
continued
ranulph
pointing
to
it
look
at
it
and
you
have
the
fair
creature
i
speak
of
before
you
the
color
of
the
hair
the
tenderness
of
the
eyes
no
the
expression
is
not
so
sad
except
when
but
no
matter
i
recognized
her
features
at
once
it
struck
me
that
upon
the
mention
of
my
name
the
party
betrayed
some
surprise
especially
the
elder
lady
for
my
own
part
i
was
so
attracted
by
the
beauty
of
the
daughter
the
effect
of
which
upon
me
seemed
rather
the
fulfilment
of
a
predestined
event
originating
in
the
strange
fascination
which
the
family
portrait
had
wrought
in
my
heart
than
the
operation
of
what
is
called
at
first
sight
that
i
was
insensible
to
the
agitation
of
the
mother
in
vain
i
endeavored
to
rally
myself
my
efforts
at
conversation
were
fruitless
i
could
not
talk
all
i
could
do
was
silently
to
yield
to
the
soft
witchery
of
those
tender
eyes
my
admiration
increasing
each
instant
that
i
gazed
upon
them
i
accompanied
them
home
attracted
as
by
some
irresistible
spell
i
could
not
tear
myself
away
so
that
although
i
fancied
i
could
perceive
symptoms
of
displeasure
in
the
looks
of
both
the
mother
and
the
son
yet
regardless
of
consequences
i
ventured
uninvited
to
enter
the
house
in
order
to
shake
off
the
restraint
which
i
felt
my
society
imposed
i
found
it
absolutely
necessary
to
divest
myself
of
bashfulness
and
to
exert
such
conversational
powers
as
i
possessed
i
succeeded
so
well
that
the
discourse
soon
became
lively
and
animated
and
what
chiefly
delighted
me
was
that
for
whose
sake
i
had
committed
my
present
rudeness
became
radiant
with
smiles
i
had
been
all
eagerness
to
seek
for
some
explanation
of
the
resemblance
to
which
i
have
just
alluded
and
the
fitting
moment
had
i
conceived
arrived
i
called
attention
to
a
peculiar
expression
in
the
features
of
miss
mowbray
and
then
instanced
the
likeness
that
subsisted
between
her
and
my
ancestress
is
the
more
singular
i
said
turning
to
her
mother
there
could
have
been
no
affinity
that
i
am
aware
of
between
them
and
yet
the
likeness
is
really
surprising
is
not
so
singular
as
you
imagine
answered
mowbray
a
close
affinity
that
lady
rookwood
was
my
mother
eleanor
mowbray
resemble
her
ancestress
words
can
not
paint
my
astonishment
i
gazed
at
mowbray
considering
whether
i
had
not
misconstrued
her
speech
whether
i
had
not
so
shaped
the
sounds
as
to
suit
my
own
quick
and
passionate
conceptions
but
no
i
read
in
her
calm
collected
countenance
in
the
downcast
glance
and
sudden
sadness
of
eleanor
as
well
as
in
the
changed
and
haughty
demeanor
of
the
brother
that
i
had
heard
her
rightly
eleanor
mowbray
was
my
cousin
the
descendant
of
that
hapless
creature
whose
image
i
had
almost
worshipped
recovering
from
my
surprise
i
addressed
mowbray
endeavoring
to
excuse
my
ignorance
of
our
relationship
on
the
plea
that
i
had
not
been
given
to
understand
that
such
had
been
the
name
of
the
gentleman
she
had
espoused
was
it
answered
she
name
he
bore
at
rookwood
circumstances
forbade
it
then
from
the
hour
i
quitted
that
house
until
this
moment
excepting
one
interview
with
my
with
sir
reginald
rookwood
i
have
seen
none
of
my
family
have
held
no
communication
with
them
my
brothers
have
been
strangers
to
me
the
very
name
of
rookwood
has
been
unheard
unknown
nor
would
you
have
been
admitted
here
had
not
accident
occasioned
it
i
ventured
now
to
interrupt
her
and
to
express
a
hope
that
she
would
suffer
an
acquaintance
to
be
kept
up
which
had
so
fortunately
commenced
and
which
might
most
probably
bring
about
an
entire
reconciliation
between
the
families
i
was
so
earnest
in
my
expostulations
my
whole
soul
being
in
them
that
she
inclined
a
more
friendly
ear
to
me
eleanor
too
smiled
encouragement
love
lent
me
eloquence
and
at
length
as
a
token
of
my
success
and
her
own
relenting
mowbray
held
forth
her
hand
i
clasped
it
eagerly
it
was
the
happiest
moment
of
my
life
i
will
not
trouble
you
with
any
lengthened
description
of
eleanor
mowbray
i
hope
at
some
period
or
other
you
may
still
be
enabled
to
see
her
and
judge
for
yourself
for
though
adverse
circumstances
have
hitherto
conspired
to
separate
us
the
time
for
a
renewal
of
our
acquaintance
is
approaching
i
trust
for
i
am
not
yet
altogether
without
hope
but
this
much
i
may
be
allowed
to
say
that
her
rare
endowments
of
person
were
only
equalled
by
the
graces
of
her
mind
educated
abroad
she
had
all
the
vivacity
of
our
livelier
neighbors
combined
with
every
solid
qualification
which
we
claim
as
more
essentially
our
own
her
light
and
frolic
manner
was
french
certainly
but
her
gentle
sincere
heart
was
as
surely
english
the
foreign
accent
that
dwelt
upon
her
tongue
communicated
an
inexpressible
charm
even
to
the
language
which
she
spoke
i
will
not
dwell
too
long
upon
this
theme
i
feel
ashamed
of
my
own
prolixity
and
yet
i
am
sure
you
will
pardon
it
ah
those
bright
brief
days
too
quickly
were
they
fled
i
could
expatiate
upon
each
minute
recall
each
word
revive
each
look
it
may
not
be
i
must
hasten
on
darker
themes
await
me
my
love
made
rapid
progress
i
became
each
hour
more
enamored
of
my
cousin
my
whole
time
was
passed
near
her
indeed
i
could
scarcely
exist
in
absence
from
her
side
short
however
was
destined
to
be
my
indulgence
in
this
blissful
state
one
happy
week
was
its
extent
i
received
a
peremptory
summons
from
my
father
to
return
home
immediately
upon
commencing
this
acquaintance
i
had
written
to
my
father
explaining
every
particular
attending
it
this
i
should
have
done
of
my
own
free
will
but
i
was
urged
to
it
by
mowbray
unaccustomed
to
disguise
i
had
expatiated
upon
the
beauty
of
eleanor
and
in
such
terms
i
fear
that
i
excited
some
uneasiness
in
his
breast
his
letter
was
laconic
he
made
no
allusion
to
the
subject
upon
which
i
had
expatiated
when
writing
to
him
he
commanded
me
to
return
the
bitter
hour
was
at
hand
i
could
not
hesitate
to
comply
without
my
father
sanction
i
was
assured
mowbray
would
not
permit
any
continuance
of
my
acquaintance
of
eleanor
inclinations
i
fancied
i
had
some
assurance
but
without
her
mother
consent
to
whose
will
she
was
devoted
i
felt
had
i
even
been
inclined
to
urge
it
that
my
suit
was
hopeless
the
letter
which
i
had
received
from
my
father
made
me
more
than
doubt
whether
i
should
not
find
him
utterly
adverse
to
my
wishes
agonized
therefore
with
a
thousand
apprehensions
i
presented
myself
on
the
morning
of
my
departure
it
was
then
i
made
the
declaration
of
my
passion
to
eleanor
it
was
then
that
every
hope
was
confirmed
every
apprehension
realized
i
received
from
her
lips
a
confirmation
of
my
fondest
wishes
yet
were
those
hopes
blighted
in
the
bud
when
i
heard
at
the
same
time
that
their
consummation
was
dependent
on
the
will
of
two
others
whose
assenting
voices
she
feared
could
never
be
obtained
from
mowbray
i
received
a
more
decided
reply
all
her
haughtiness
was
aroused
her
farewell
words
assured
me
that
it
was
indifferent
to
her
whether
we
met
again
as
relatives
or
as
strangers
then
was
it
that
the
native
tenderness
of
eleanor
displayed
itself
in
an
outbreak
of
feeling
peculiar
to
a
heart
keenly
sympathetic
as
hers
she
saw
my
suffering
the
reserve
natural
to
her
sex
gave
way
she
flung
herself
into
my
arms
and
so
we
parted
with
a
heavy
foreboding
i
returned
to
rookwood
and
oppressed
with
the
gloomiest
anticipations
endeavored
to
prepare
myself
for
the
worst
i
arrived
my
reception
was
such
as
i
had
calculated
upon
and
to
increase
my
distress
my
parents
had
been
at
variance
i
will
not
pain
you
and
myself
with
any
recital
of
their
disagreement
my
mother
had
espoused
my
cause
chiefly
i
fear
with
the
view
of
thwarting
my
poor
father
inclinations
he
was
in
a
terrible
mood
exasperated
by
the
fiery
stimulants
he
had
swallowed
which
had
not
indeed
drowned
his
reason
but
roused
and
inflamed
every
dormant
emotion
to
violence
he
was
as
one
insane
it
was
evening
when
i
arrived
i
would
willingly
have
postponed
the
interview
till
the
morrow
it
could
not
be
he
insisted
upon
seeing
me
my
mother
was
present
you
know
the
restraint
she
usually
had
over
my
father
and
how
she
maintained
it
on
this
occasion
she
had
none
he
questioned
me
as
to
every
particular
probed
my
secret
soul
dragged
forth
every
latent
feeling
and
then
thundered
out
his
own
determination
that
eleanor
never
should
be
bride
of
mine
nor
would
he
receive
under
his
roof
her
mother
the
discountenanced
daughter
of
his
father
i
endeavored
to
remonstrate
with
him
he
was
deaf
to
my
entreaties
my
mother
added
sharp
and
stinging
words
to
my
expostulations
had
her
consent
she
said
more
was
needed
the
lands
were
entailed
i
should
at
no
distant
period
be
their
master
and
might
then
please
myself
this
i
mention
in
order
to
give
you
my
father
strange
answer
a
care
madam
replied
he
bridle
your
tongue
they
entailed
is
true
but
i
need
not
ask
consent
to
cut
off
that
entail
let
him
dare
to
disobey
me
in
this
particular
and
i
will
so
divert
the
channel
of
my
wealth
that
no
drop
shall
reach
him
i
will
but
why
threaten
let
him
do
it
and
approve
the
consequences
on
the
morrow
i
renewed
my
importunities
with
no
better
success
we
were
alone
said
he
waste
time
in
seeking
to
change
my
resolution
it
is
unalterable
i
have
many
motives
which
influence
me
they
are
inexplicable
but
imperative
eleanor
mowbray
never
can
be
yours
forget
her
as
speedily
as
may
be
and
i
pledge
myself
upon
whomsoever
else
your
choice
may
fix
i
will
offer
no
obstacle
why
exclaimed
i
with
vehemence
you
object
to
one
whom
you
have
never
beheld
at
least
consent
to
see
her
he
replied
tie
is
sundered
and
can
not
be
reunited
my
father
bound
me
by
an
oath
never
to
meet
in
friendship
with
my
sister
i
will
not
break
my
vow
i
will
not
violate
its
conditions
even
in
the
second
degree
we
never
can
meet
again
an
idle
prophecy
which
i
have
heard
has
said
when
a
rookwood
shall
marry
a
rookwood
the
end
of
the
house
draweth
that
i
regard
not
it
may
have
no
meaning
or
it
may
have
much
to
me
it
imports
nothing
further
than
that
if
you
wed
eleanor
every
acre
i
possess
shall
depart
from
you
and
assure
yourself
this
is
no
idle
threat
i
can
and
will
do
it
my
curse
shall
be
your
sole
inheritance
i
could
not
avoid
making
some
reply
representing
to
him
how
unjustifiable
such
a
procedure
was
to
me
in
a
case
where
the
happiness
of
my
life
was
at
stake
and
how
inconsistent
it
was
with
the
charitable
precepts
of
our
faith
to
allow
feelings
of
resentment
to
influence
his
conduct
my
remonstrances
as
in
the
preceding
meeting
were
ineffectual
the
more
i
spoke
the
more
intemperate
he
grew
i
therefore
desisted
but
not
before
he
had
ordered
me
to
quit
the
house
i
did
not
leave
the
neighborhood
but
saw
him
again
on
the
same
evening
our
last
interview
took
place
in
the
garden
i
then
told
him
that
i
had
determined
to
go
abroad
for
two
years
at
the
expiration
of
which
period
i
proposed
returning
to
england
trusting
that
his
resolution
might
then
be
changed
and
that
he
would
listen
to
my
request
for
the
fulfilment
of
which
i
could
never
cease
to
hope
time
i
hoped
might
befriend
me
he
approved
of
my
plan
of
travelling
requesting
me
not
to
see
eleanor
before
i
set
out
adding
in
a
melancholy
tone
may
never
meet
again
ranulph
in
this
life
in
that
case
farewell
forever
indulge
no
vain
hopes
eleanor
never
can
be
yours
but
upon
one
condition
and
to
that
you
would
never
consent
it
i
cried
is
no
condition
i
could
not
accede
to
boy
he
replied
know
not
what
you
say
that
pledge
you
would
never
fulfil
were
i
to
propose
it
to
you
but
no
should
i
survive
till
you
return
you
shall
learn
it
then
and
now
farewell
now
i
beseech
you
i
exclaimed
everything
what
you
will
no
more
replied
he
walking
towards
the
house
you
return
we
will
renew
this
subject
farewell
perhaps
forever
his
words
were
prophetic
that
parting
forever
i
remained
in
the
garden
till
nightfall
i
saw
my
mother
but
came
not
again
i
quitted
england
without
beholding
eleanor
did
you
not
acquaint
her
by
letter
with
what
had
occurred
and
your
consequent
intentions
asked
small
i
did
replied
ranulph
but
i
received
no
reply
my
earliest
inquiries
will
be
directed
to
ascertain
whether
the
family
are
still
in
london
it
will
be
a
question
for
our
consideration
whether
i
am
not
justified
in
departing
from
my
father
expressed
wishes
or
whether
i
should
violate
his
commands
in
so
doing
we
will
discuss
that
point
hereafter
replied
small
adding
as
he
noticed
the
growing
paleness
of
his
companion
you
are
too
much
exhausted
to
proceed
you
had
better
defer
the
remainder
of
your
story
to
a
future
period
no
replied
ranulph
swallowing
a
glass
of
water
i
am
exhausted
yet
i
can
not
rest
my
blood
is
in
a
fever
which
nothing
will
allay
i
shall
feel
more
easy
when
i
have
made
the
present
communication
i
am
approaching
the
sequel
of
my
narrative
you
are
now
in
possession
of
the
story
of
my
love
of
the
motive
of
my
departure
you
shall
learn
what
was
the
occasion
of
my
return
i
had
wandered
from
city
to
city
during
my
term
of
exile
consumed
by
hopeless
passion
with
little
that
could
amuse
though
surrounded
by
a
thousand
objects
of
interest
to
others
and
only
rendering
life
endurable
by
severest
study
or
most
active
exertion
my
steps
conducted
me
to
bordeaux
there
i
made
a
long
halt
enchanted
by
the
beauty
of
the
neighboring
scenery
my
fancy
was
smitten
by
the
situation
of
a
villa
on
the
banks
of
the
garonne
within
a
few
leagues
of
the
city
it
was
an
old
château
with
fine
gardens
bordering
the
blue
waters
of
the
river
and
commanding
a
multitude
of
enchanting
prospects
the
house
which
had
in
part
gone
to
decay
was
inhabited
by
an
aged
couple
who
had
formerly
been
servants
to
an
english
family
the
members
of
which
had
thus
provided
for
them
on
their
return
to
their
own
country
i
inquired
the
name
conceive
my
astonishment
to
find
that
this
château
had
been
the
residence
of
the
mowbrays
this
intelligence
decided
me
at
once
i
took
up
my
abode
in
the
house
and
a
new
and
unexpected
source
of
solace
and
delight
was
opened
to
me
i
traced
the
paths
she
had
traced
occupied
the
room
she
had
occupied
tended
the
flowers
she
had
tended
and
on
the
golden
summer
evenings
would
watch
the
rapid
waters
tinged
with
all
the
glorious
hues
of
sunset
sweeping
past
my
feet
and
think
how
had
watched
them
her
presence
seemed
to
pervade
the
place
i
was
now
comparatively
happy
and
anxious
to
remain
unmolested
wrote
home
that
i
was
leaving
bordeaux
for
the
pyrenees
on
my
way
to
spain
that
account
arrived
observed
small
one
night
continued
ranulph
is
now
the
sixth
since
the
occurrence
i
am
about
to
relate
i
was
seated
in
a
bower
that
overlooked
the
river
it
had
been
a
lovely
evening
so
lovely
that
i
lingered
there
wrapped
in
the
heavenly
contemplation
of
its
beauties
i
watched
each
rosy
tint
reflected
upon
the
surface
of
the
rapid
stream
now
fading
into
yellow
now
shining
silvery
white
i
noticed
the
mystic
mingling
of
twilight
with
darkness
of
night
with
day
till
the
bright
current
on
a
sudden
became
a
black
mass
of
waters
i
could
scarcely
discern
a
leaf
all
was
darkness
when
lo
another
change
the
moon
was
up
a
flood
of
light
deluged
all
around
the
stream
was
dancing
again
in
reflected
radiance
and
i
still
lingering
at
its
brink
i
had
been
musing
for
some
moments
with
my
head
resting
upon
my
hand
when
happening
to
raise
my
eyes
i
beheld
a
figure
immediately
before
me
i
was
astonished
at
the
sight
for
i
had
perceived
no
one
approach
had
heard
no
footstep
advance
towards
me
and
was
satisfied
that
no
one
besides
myself
could
be
in
the
garden
the
presence
of
the
figure
inspired
me
with
an
undefinable
awe
and
i
can
scarce
tell
why
but
a
thrilling
presentiment
convinced
me
that
it
was
a
supernatural
visitant
without
motion
without
life
without
substance
it
seemed
yet
still
the
outward
character
of
life
was
there
i
started
to
my
feet
god
what
did
i
behold
the
face
was
turned
to
me
my
father
face
and
what
an
aspect
what
a
look
time
can
never
efface
that
terrible
expression
it
is
graven
upon
my
memory
i
can
not
describe
it
it
was
not
anger
it
was
not
pain
it
was
as
if
an
eternity
of
woe
were
stamped
upon
its
features
it
was
too
dreadful
to
behold
i
would
fain
have
averted
my
gaze
my
eyes
were
fascinated
fixed
i
could
not
withdraw
them
from
the
ghastly
countenance
i
shrank
from
it
yet
stirred
not
i
could
not
move
a
limb
noiselessly
gliding
towards
me
the
apparition
approached
i
could
not
retreat
it
stood
obstinately
beside
me
i
became
as
one
the
phantom
shook
its
head
with
the
deepest
despair
and
as
the
word
sounded
hollowly
in
my
ears
it
gradually
melted
from
my
view
i
can
not
tell
how
i
recovered
from
the
swoon
into
which
i
fell
but
daybreak
saw
me
on
my
way
to
england
i
am
here
on
that
night
at
that
same
hour
my
father
died
it
was
after
all
then
a
supernatural
summons
that
you
received
said
small
undoubtedly
replied
ranulph
humph
the
coincidence
i
own
is
sufficiently
curious
returned
small
musingly
but
it
would
not
be
difficult
i
think
to
discover
a
satisfactory
explanation
of
the
delusion
there
was
no
delusion
replied
ranulph
coldly
the
figure
was
as
palpable
as
your
own
can
i
doubt
when
i
behold
this
result
could
any
deceit
have
been
practised
upon
me
at
that
distance
the
precise
time
moreover
agreeing
did
not
the
phantom
bid
me
return
i
returned
he
is
dead
i
have
gazed
upon
a
being
of
another
world
to
doubt
were
impious
after
that
look
whatever
my
opinions
may
be
my
dear
young
friend
returned
small
gravely
i
will
suspend
them
for
the
present
you
are
still
greatly
excited
let
me
advise
you
to
seek
some
repose
i
am
easier
replied
ranulph
but
you
are
right
i
will
endeavor
to
snatch
a
little
rest
something
within
tells
me
all
is
not
yet
accomplished
what
remains
i
shudder
to
think
of
it
i
will
rejoin
you
at
midnight
i
shall
myself
attend
the
solemnity
adieu
ranulph
quitted
the
room
small
sighingly
shook
his
head
and
having
lighted
his
pipe
was
presently
buried
in
a
profundity
of
smoke
and
metaphysical
speculation
de
your
unhappy
husband
is
dead
oh
he
a
happy
husband
now
he
owes
nature
nothing
and
look
upon
this
creature
as
his
wife
she
comes
not
like
a
widow
she
comes
armed
with
scorn
and
impudence
is
this
a
mourning
habit
white
the
progress
of
our
narrative
demands
our
presence
in
another
apartment
of
the
hall
a
large
lonesome
chamber
situate
in
the
eastern
wing
of
the
house
already
described
as
the
most
ancient
part
of
the
building
the
sombre
appearance
of
which
was
greatly
increased
by
the
dingy
discolored
tapestry
that
clothed
its
walls
the
record
of
the
patience
and
industry
of
a
certain
dame
dorothy
rookwood
who
flourished
some
centuries
ago
and
whose
skilful
needle
had
illustrated
the
slaughter
of
the
innocents
with
a
severity
of
and
sanguinary
minuteness
of
detail
truly
surprising
in
a
lady
so
amiable
as
she
was
represented
to
have
been
herod
glared
from
the
ghostly
woof
with
his
shadowy
legions
executing
their
murderous
purposes
grouped
like
a
troop
of
witches
around
him
mysterious
twilight
admitted
through
the
deep
dark
mullioned
windows
revealed
the
antique
furniture
of
the
room
which
still
boasted
a
sort
of
mildewed
splendor
more
imposing
perhaps
than
its
original
gaudy
magnificence
and
showed
the
lofty
hangings
and
tall
canopy
of
a
bedstead
once
a
couch
of
state
but
now
destined
for
the
repose
of
lady
rookwood
the
stiff
crimson
hangings
were
embroidered
in
gold
with
the
arms
and
cipher
of
elizabeth
from
whom
the
apartment
having
once
been
occupied
by
that
sovereign
obtained
the
name
of
the
queen
room
the
sole
tenant
of
this
chamber
was
a
female
in
whose
countenance
if
time
and
strong
emotion
had
written
strange
defeatures
they
had
not
obliterated
its
striking
beauty
and
classical
grandeur
of
expression
it
was
a
face
majestical
and
severe
pride
was
stamped
in
all
its
lines
and
though
each
passion
was
by
turns
developed
it
was
evident
that
all
were
subordinate
to
the
sin
by
which
the
angels
fell
the
contour
of
her
face
was
formed
in
the
purest
grecian
mould
and
might
have
been
a
model
for
medea
so
well
did
the
gloomy
grandeur
of
the
brow
the
severe
chiselling
of
the
lip
the
rounded
beauty
of
the
throat
and
the
faultless
symmetry
of
her
full
form
accord
with
the
beau
ideal
of
antique
perfection
shaded
by
smooth
folds
of
raven
hair
which
still
maintained
its
jetty
dye
her
lofty
forehead
would
have
been
displayed
to
the
greatest
advantage
had
it
not
been
at
this
moment
knit
and
deformed
by
excess
of
passion
if
that
passion
can
be
said
to
deform
which
only
calls
forth
strong
and
vehement
expression
her
figure
which
wanted
only
height
to
give
it
dignity
was
arrayed
in
the
garb
of
widowhood
and
if
she
exhibited
none
of
the
desolation
of
heart
which
such
a
bereavement
might
have
been
expected
to
awaken
she
was
evidently
a
prey
to
feelings
scarcely
less
harrowing
at
the
particular
time
of
which
we
speak
lady
rookwood
for
she
it
was
was
occupied
in
the
investigation
of
the
contents
of
an
escritoire
examining
the
papers
which
it
contained
with
great
deliberation
she
threw
each
aside
as
soon
as
she
had
satisfied
herself
of
its
purport
until
she
arrived
at
a
little
package
carefully
tied
up
with
black
ribbon
and
sealed
this
lady
rookwood
hastily
broke
open
and
drew
forth
a
small
miniature
it
was
that
of
a
female
young
and
beautiful
rudely
yet
faithfully
executed
faithfully
we
say
for
there
was
an
air
of
sweetness
and
simplicity
and
in
short
a
look
of
reality
and
nature
about
the
picture
it
is
seldom
indeed
that
we
mistake
a
likeness
even
if
we
are
unacquainted
with
the
original
that
attested
the
artist
fidelity
the
face
was
as
radiant
with
smiles
as
a
bright
day
with
sunbeams
the
portrait
was
set
in
gold
and
behind
it
was
looped
a
lock
of
the
darkest
and
finest
hair
underneath
the
miniature
was
written
in
sir
hand
the
words
a
slip
of
folded
paper
was
also
attached
to
it
lady
rookwood
scornfully
scrutinized
the
features
for
a
few
moments
and
then
unfolded
the
paper
at
the
sight
of
which
she
started
and
turned
pale
thank
god
she
cried
this
is
in
my
possession
while
i
hold
this
we
are
safe
were
it
not
better
to
destroy
this
evidence
at
once
no
no
not
it
shall
not
part
from
me
i
will
abide
return
this
document
will
give
me
a
power
over
him
such
as
i
could
never
otherwise
obtain
placing
the
marriage
certificate
for
such
it
was
within
her
breast
and
laying
the
miniature
upon
the
table
she
next
proceeded
deliberately
to
arrange
the
disordered
contents
of
the
box
all
outward
traces
of
emotion
had
ere
this
become
so
subdued
in
lady
rookwood
that
although
she
had
only
a
few
moments
previously
exhibited
the
extremity
of
passionate
indignation
she
now
apparently
without
effort
resumed
entire
composure
and
might
have
been
supposed
to
be
engaged
in
a
matter
of
little
interest
to
herself
it
was
a
dread
calm
which
they
who
knew
her
would
have
trembled
to
behold
from
these
letters
i
gather
exclaimed
she
that
their
wretched
offspring
knows
not
of
his
fortune
so
far
well
there
is
no
channel
whence
he
can
derive
information
and
my
first
care
shall
be
to
prevent
his
obtaining
any
clue
to
the
secret
of
his
birth
i
am
directed
to
provide
for
him
ha
ha
i
will
provide
a
grave
there
will
i
bury
him
and
his
secret
my
son
security
and
my
own
wrong
demand
it
i
must
choose
surer
hands
the
work
must
not
be
as
heretofore
and
now
i
bethink
me
he
is
in
the
neighborhood
connected
with
a
gang
of
poachers
is
as
i
could
wish
it
at
this
moment
a
knock
at
the
broke
upon
her
meditations
agnes
is
it
you
demanded
lady
rookwood
thus
summoned
the
old
attendant
entered
the
room
why
are
my
orders
disobeyed
asked
the
lady
in
a
severe
tone
of
voice
did
i
not
say
when
you
delivered
me
this
package
from
coates
which
he
himself
wished
to
present
that
i
would
not
be
disturbed
you
did
my
lady
but
speak
out
said
lady
rookwood
somewhat
more
mildly
perceiving
from
agnes
manner
that
she
had
something
of
importance
to
communicate
what
is
it
brings
you
hither
i
am
sorry
returned
agnes
to
disturb
your
ladyship
but
but
but
what
interrupted
lady
rookwood
impatiently
i
could
not
help
it
my
lady
he
would
have
me
come
he
said
he
was
resolved
to
see
your
ladyship
whether
you
would
or
not
would
see
me
ha
is
it
so
i
guess
his
errand
and
its
object
he
has
some
suspicion
no
that
can
not
be
he
would
not
dare
to
tamper
with
these
seals
agnes
i
will
see
him
but
he
swears
my
lady
that
he
will
not
leave
the
house
without
seeing
you
he
would
have
forced
his
way
into
your
presence
if
i
had
not
consented
to
announce
him
insolent
exclaimed
lady
rookwood
with
a
glance
of
indignation
force
his
way
i
promise
you
he
shall
not
display
an
equal
anxiety
to
repeat
the
visit
tell

will
see
him

lady

luke
bradley
your
ladyship
knows
whom
i
mean
he
here
now
yes
my
lady
and
looking
so
fierce
and
strange
i
was
quite
frightened
to
see
him
he
looked
so
like
his
his
his
father
you
would
say
speak
out
no
my
lady
his
grandfather
old
sir
reginald
he
the
very
image
of
him
but

not
your
ladyship

ring
the
and
when
he
comes
in
i
run
and
fetch
the
servants
he
dangerous
i
sure
i
have
no
fears
of
him
he
see
me
you
say
ay
exclaimed
luke
as
he
threw
open
the
door
and
shut
it
forcibly
after
him
striding
towards
lady
rookwood
nor
abide
longer
delay
it
was
an
instant
or
two
ere
lady
rookwood
thus
taken
by
surprise
could
command
speech
she
fixed
her
eyes
with
a
look
of
keen
and
angry
inquiry
upon
the
bold
intruder
who
nothing
daunted
confronted
her
glances
with
a
gaze
as
stern
and
steadfast
as
her
own
who
are
you
and
what
seek
you
exclaimed
lady
rookwood
after
a
brief
pause
and
in
spite
of
herself
her
voice
sounded
tremulously
what
would
you
have
that
you
venture
to
appear
before
me
at
this
season
and
in
this
fashion
i
might
have
chosen
a
fitter
opportunity
returned
luke
were
it
needed
my
business
will
not
brook
delay
you
must
be
pleased
to
overlook
this
intrusion
on
your
privacy
at
a
season
of
sorrow
like
the
present
as
to
the
fashion
of
my
visit
you
must
be
content
to
excuse
it
i
can
not
help
myself
i
may
amend
hereafter
who
i
am
you
are
able
i
doubt
not
to
divine
what
i
seek
you
shall
hear
when
this
old
woman
has
left
the
room
unless
you
would
have
a
witness
to
a
declaration
that
concerns
you
as
nearly
as
myself
an
indefinite
feeling
of
apprehension
had
from
the
first
instant
of
luke
entrance
crossed
lady
rookwood
mind
she
however
answered
with
some
calmness
what
you
can
have
to
say
is
of
small
moment
to
me
nor
does
it
signify
who
may
hear
it
it
shall
not
however
be
said
that
lady
rookwood
feared
to
be
alone
even
though
she
endangered
her
life
i
am
no
assassin
replied
luke
nor
have
sought
the
destruction
of
my
deadliest
foe
though
but
retributive
justice
to
have
done
so
lady
rookwood
started
nay
you
need
not
fear
me
replied
luke
my
revenge
will
be
otherwise
accomplished
go
said
lady
rookwood
to
agnes
yet
stay
without
in
the
antechamber
my
lady
said
agnes
scarcely
able
to
articulate
shall
i
hear
me
lady
rookwood
interrupted
luke
i
repeat
i
intend
you
no
injury
my
object
here
is
solely
to
obtain
a
private
conference
you
can
have
no
reason
for
denying
me
this
request
i
will
not
abuse
your
patience
mine
is
no
idle
mission
say
you
refuse
me
and
i
will
at
once
depart
i
will
find
other
means
of
communicating
with
you
less
direct
and
therefore
less
desirable
make
your
election
but
we
be
alone
undisturbed
summon
your
household
let
them
lay
hands
upon
me
and
i
will
proclaim
aloud
what
you
would
gladly
hide
even
from
yourself
leave
us
agnes
said
lady
rookwood
i
have
no
fear
of
this
man
i
can
deal
with
him
myself
should
i
see
occasion
agnes
said
luke
in
a
stern
deep
whisper
arresting
the
ancient
handmaiden
as
she
passed
him
stir
not
from
the
door
till
i
come
forth
have
you
forgotten
your
former
mistress
my
mother
have
you
forgotten
barbara
lovel
and
in
heaven
name
hush
replied
agnes
with
a
shudder
let
that
be
fresh
in
your
memory
move
not
a
footstep
whatever
you
may
hear
added
he
in
the
same
tone
as
before
i
will
not
i
will
not
and
agnes
departed
luke
felt
some
wavering
in
his
resolution
when
he
found
himself
alone
with
the
lady
whose
calm
collected
yet
haughty
demeanor
as
she
resumed
her
seat
prepared
for
his
communication
could
not
fail
to
inspire
him
with
a
certain
degree
of
awe
not
unconscious
of
her
advantage
nor
slow
to
profit
by
it
lady
rookwood
remained
perfectly
silent
with
her
eyes
steadily
fixed
upon
his
face
while
his
embarrassment
momentarily
increased
summoning
at
length
courage
sufficient
to
address
her
and
ashamed
of
his
want
of
nerve
he
thus
broke
forth
when
i
entered
this
room
you
asked
my
name
and
object
as
to
the
first
i
answer
to
the
same
designation
as
your
ladyship
i
have
long
borne
my
mother
name
i
now
claim
my
father
my
object
is
the
restitution
of
my
rights
soh
it
is
as
i
suspected
thought
lady
rookwood
involuntarily
casting
her
large
eyes
down
do
i
hear
you
rightly
exclaimed
she
aloud
your
name
is
sir
luke
rookwood
as
my
father
elder
born
by
right
of
right
to
that
title
if
a
glance
could
have
slain
him
luke
had
fallen
lifeless
at
the
feet
with
a
smile
of
ineffable
disdain
she
replied
i
know
not
why
i
hesitate
to
resent
this
indignity
even
for
an
instant
but
i
would
see
how
far
your
audacity
will
carry
you
the
name
you
bear
is
bradley
in
ignorance
i
have
done
so
replied
luke
i
am
the
son
of
her
whose
maiden
name
was
bradley
she
was
is
false
i
will
not
hear
it
she
was
cried
lady
rookwood
her
vehemence
getting
the
master
of
her
prudence
your
ladyship
anticipates
my
meaning
returned
luke
susan
bradley
was
the
first
wife
of
sir
piers
rookwood
his
minion
his
mistress
if
you
will
nought
else
is
it
new
to
you
that
a
village
wench
who
lends
herself
to
shame
should
be
beguiled
by
such
shallow
pretences
that
she
was
so
duped
i
doubt
not
but
it
is
too
late
now
to
complain
and
i
would
counsel
you
not
to
repeat
your
idle
boast
it
will
serve
no
other
purpose
trust
me
than
to
blazon
forth
your
own
your
mother
dishonor
lady
rookwood
sternly
answered
luke
my
mother
fame
is
as
free
from
dishonor
as
your
own
i
repeat
she
was
the
first
wife
of
sir
piers
and
that
i
her
child
am
first
in
the
inheritance
nay
sole
heir
to
the
estates
and
title
of
rookwood
to
the
exclusion
of
your
son
ponder
upon
that
intelligence
men
say
they
fear
you
as
a
thing
of
fear
you
not
there
been
days
when
the
rookwoods
held
their
dames
in
subjection
discern
you
nought
of
that
in
me
once
or
twice
during
this
speech
lady
rookwood
glances
had
wandered
towards
the
as
if
about
to
summon
aid
but
the
intention
was
abandoned
almost
as
soon
as
formed
probably
from
apprehension
of
the
consequences
of
any
such
attempt
she
was
not
without
alarm
as
to
the
result
of
the
interview
and
was
considering
how
she
could
bring
it
to
a
termination
without
endangering
herself
and
if
possible
secure
the
person
of
luke
when
the
latter
turning
sharply
round
upon
her
and
drawing
a
pistol
exclaimed
follow
me
whither
asked
she
in
alarm
to
the
chamber
of
death
why
there
what
would
you
do
villain
i
will
not
trust
my
life
with
you
i
will
follow
you
hesitate
not
as
you
value
your
life
do
aught
to
alarm
the
house
and
i
fire
your
safety
depends
upon
yourself
i
would
see
my
father
body
ere
it
be
laid
in
the
grave
i
will
not
leave
you
here
go
said
lady
rookwood
if
that
be
all
i
pledge
myself
you
shall
not
be
interrupted
i
will
not
take
your
pledge
your
presence
shall
be
my
surety
by
my
mother
unavenged
memory
if
you
play
me
false
though
all
your
satellites
stand
around
you
you
die
upon
the
spot
obey
me
and
you
are
safe
our
way
leads
to
the
room
by
the
private
staircase
we
shall
pass
unobserved
you
see
i
know
the
road
the
room
by
your
own
command
is
vacant
save
of
the
dead
we
shall
therefore
be
alone
this
done
i
depart
you
will
then
be
free
to
act
disobey
me
and
your
blood
be
upon
your
own
head
lead
on
said
lady
rookwood
pressing
towards
the
antechamber
the
door
i
mean
is
there
pointing
to
another
part
of
the
room
that
panel
ha
how
know
you
that
no
matter
follow
luke
touched
a
spring
and
the
panel
flying
open
disclosed
a
dim
recess
into
which
he
entered
and
seizing
lady
rookwood
hand
dragged
her
after
him
chamber
of
it
is
the
body
i
have
orders
given
that
here
it
should
be
laid
the
recess
upon
which
the
panel
opened
had
been
a
small
oratory
and
though
entirely
disused
still
retained
its
cushions
and
its
crucifix
there
were
two
other
entrances
to
this
place
of
prayer
the
one
communicating
with
a
further
bedchamber
the
other
leading
to
the
gallery
through
the
latter
after
closing
the
aperture
without
relinquishing
his
grasp
luke
passed
it
was
growing
rapidly
dark
and
at
the
brightest
seasons
this
gloomy
corridor
was
but
imperfectly
lighted
from
narrow
painted
and
windows
that
looked
into
the
old
quadrangular
courtyard
below
and
as
they
issued
from
the
oratory
a
dazzling
flash
of
lightning
a
storm
having
suddenly
arisen
momentarily
illumined
the
whole
length
of
the
passage
disclosing
the
retreating
figure
of
a
man
wrapped
in
a
large
sable
cloak
at
the
other
extremity
of
the
gallery
lady
rookwood
uttered
an
outcry
for
assistance
but
the
man
whoever
he
might
be
disappeared
in
the
instantaneously
succeeding
gloom
leaving
her
in
doubt
whether
or
not
her
situation
had
been
perceived
luke
had
seen
this
dark
figure
at
the
same
instant
and
not
without
apprehensions
lest
his
plans
should
be
defeated
he
griped
lady
rookwood
arm
still
more
strictly
and
placing
the
muzzle
of
the
pistol
to
her
breast
hurried
her
rapidly
forwards
all
was
now
in
total
obscurity
the
countenance
of
neither
could
be
perceived
as
they
trod
the
dark
passage
but
luke
unrelaxed
grasp
indicated
no
change
in
his
purposes
nor
did
the
slow
dignified
march
of
the
lady
betray
any
apprehension
on
her
part
descending
a
spiral
staircase
which
led
from
the
gallery
to
a
lower
story
their
way
now
lay
beneath
the
a
means
of
communication
little
used
their
tread
sounded
hollowly
on
the
flagged
floor
no
other
sound
was
heard
mounting
a
staircase
similar
to
the
one
they
had
just
descended
they
arrived
at
another
passage
a
few
paces
brought
them
to
the
door
luke
turned
the
handle
and
they
stood
within
the
chamber
of
the
dead
the
room
which
contained
the
remains
of
poor
sir
piers
was
arrayed
in
all
that
mockery
of
state
which
vainly
attempting
to
deride
death
is
itself
a
bitter
derision
of
the
living
it
was
the
one
devoted
to
the
principal
meals
of
the
day
a
strange
choice
but
convenience
had
dictated
its
adoption
by
those
with
whom
this
part
of
the
ceremonial
had
originated
and
long
custom
had
rendered
its
usage
for
this
purpose
almost
prescriptive
this
room
which
was
of
some
size
had
originally
formed
part
of
the
great
hall
from
which
it
was
divided
by
a
thick
screen
of
black
lustrously
varnished
oak
enriched
with
fanciful
figures
carved
in
bold
relief
the
walls
were
panelled
with
the
same
embrowned
material
and
sustained
sundry
portraits
of
the
members
of
the
family
in
every
possible
costume
from
the
steely
gear
of
sir
ranulph
down
to
the
flowing
attire
of
sir
reginald
most
of
the
race
were
ranged
around
the
room
and
seen
in
the
yellow
light
shed
upon
their
features
by
the
flambeaux
they
looked
like
an
array
of
stern
and
silent
witnesses
gazing
upon
their
departed
descendant
the
sides
of
the
chamber
were
hung
with
black
cloth
and
upon
a
bier
in
the
middle
of
the
room
rested
the
body
broad
escutcheons
decked
out
in
glowing
colors
pompously
set
forth
the
heraldic
honors
of
the
departed
tall
lights
burned
at
the
head
and
feet
and
fragrant
perfumes
diffused
their
odors
from
silver
censers
the
entrance
of
luke
and
his
unwilling
companion
had
been
abrupt
the
transition
from
darkness
to
the
glare
of
light
was
almost
blinding
and
they
had
advanced
far
into
the
room
ere
lady
rookwood
perceived
a
man
whom
she
took
to
be
one
of
the
mutes
leaning
over
the
bier
the
was
entirely
removed
and
the
person
whose
back
was
towards
them
appeared
to
be
wrapped
in
mournful
contemplation
of
the
sad
spectacle
before
him
suddenly
bursting
from
luke
hold
lady
rookwood
rushed
forward
with
a
scream
and
touched
the
man
shoulder
he
started
at
the
summons
and
disclosed
the
features
of
her
son
rapidly
as
her
own
act
luke
followed
he
levelled
a
pistol
at
her
head
but
his
hand
dropped
to
his
side
as
he
encountered
the
glance
of
ranulph
all
three
seemed
paralyzed
by
surprise
ranulph
in
astonishment
extended
his
arm
to
his
mother
who
placing
one
arm
over
his
shoulder
pointed
with
the
other
to
luke
the
latter
stared
sternly
and
inquiringly
at
both
yet
none
spoke
we
sorry
his
violent
act
has
drawn
blood
of
honor
and
stained
our
honors
thrown
ink
upon
the
forehead
of
our
fame
which
envious
spirits
will
dip
their
pens
into
after
our
death
and
blot
us
in
our
tombs
for
that
which
would
seem
treason
in
our
lives
is
laughter
when
we
dead
who
dares
now
whisper
that
dares
not
then
speak
out
and
even
proclaim
with
loud
words
and
broad
pens
our
closest
shame
revenger
with
that
quickness
of
perception
which
at
once
supplies
information
on
such
an
emergency
luke
instantly
conjectured
who
was
before
him
startled
as
he
was
he
yet
retained
his
composure
abiding
the
result
with
his
arms
folded
upon
his
breast
seize
him
cried
lady
rookwood
as
soon
as
she
could
command
her
speech
he
rushes
on
his
death
if
he
stirs
exclaimed
luke
pointing
his
pistol
bethink
you
where
you
are
villain
cried
ranulph
you
are
entrapped
in
your
own
toils
submit
yourself
to
our
mercy
resistance
is
vain
and
will
not
secure
your
safety
while
it
will
aggravate
your
offence
surrender
yourself
never
answered
luke
know
you
whom
you
ask
to
yield
how
should
i
answered
ranulph
by
that
instinct
which
tells
me
who
are
ask
lady
rookwood
she
can
inform
you
if
she
will
parley
not
with
him
seize
him
cried
lady
rookwood
he
is
a
robber
a
murderer
who
has
assailed
my
life
beware
said
luke
to
ranulph
who
was
preparing
to
obey
his
commands
i
am
no
robber
no
murderer
do
not
you
make
me
a
fratricide
fratricide
echoed
ranulph
heed
him
not
ejaculated
lady
rookwood
it
is
false
he
dares
not
harm
thee
for
his
soul
i
will
call
assistance
hold
mother
exclaimed
ranulph
detaining
lady
rookwood
this
man
may
be
what
he
represents
himself
before
we
proceed
to
extremities
i
would
question
him
i
would
not
have
mentioned
it
in
your
hearing
could
it
have
been
avoided
but
my
father
had
another
son
lady
rookwood
frowned
she
would
have
checked
him
but
luke
rejoined
you
have
spoken
the
truth
he
had
a
son
i
am
he
i
be
silent
i
command
you
said
lady
rookwood
death
cried
luke
in
a
loud
voice
why
should
i
be
silent
at
your
bidding
at
who
regard
no
laws
human
or
divine
who
pursue
your
own
fell
purposes
without
fear
of
god
or
man
waste
not
your
frowns
on
me
i
heed
them
not
do
you
think
i
am
like
a
tame
hound
to
be
cowed
to
silence
i
speak
ranulph
rookwood
the
name
you
bear
is
mine
and
by
a
right
as
good
as
is
your
own
from
his
loins
who
lies
a
corpse
before
us
i
sprang
no
brand
of
shame
is
on
my
birth
i
am
your
father
son
his
your
brother
hear
me
cried
he
rushing
to
the
bier
by
this
body
i
swear
that
i
have
avouched
the
truth
and
though
to
me
the
dead
sir
piers
rookwood
hath
never
been
what
a
father
should
be
to
a
son
though
i
have
never
known
his
smile
felt
his
caresses
or
received
his
blessing
yet
now
be
all
forgiven
all
forgotten
and
he
cast
himself
with
frantic
violence
upon
the
coffin
it
is
difficult
to
describe
the
feelings
with
which
ranulph
heard
avowal
amazement
and
dread
predominated
unable
to
stir
he
stood
gazing
on
in
silence
not
so
lady
rookwood
the
moment
for
action
was
arrived
addressing
her
son
in
a
low
tone
she
said
your
prey
is
within
your
power
secure
him
wherefore
rejoined
ranulph
if
he
be
my
brother
shall
i
raise
my
hand
against
him
wherefore
not
returned
lady
rookwood
an
accursed
deed
replied
ranulph
the
mystery
is
resolved
was
for
this
that
i
was
summoned
home
ha
what
say
you
summoned
by
whom
my
father
your
father
echoed
lady
rookwood
in
great
surprise
ay
my
dead
father
he
has
appeared
to
me
since
his
decease
ranulph
you
rave
you
are
distracted
with
grief
with
astonishment
no
mother
but
i
will
not
struggle
against
my
destiny
pshaw
your
destiny
is
rookwood
its
manors
its
lands
its
and
its
title
nor
shall
you
yield
it
to
a
churl
like
this
let
him
prove
his
rights
let
the
law
adjudge
them
to
him
and
we
will
yield
but
not
till
then
i
tell
thee
he
has
the
right
nor
can
he
maintain
it
he
is
a
deluded
dreamer
who
having
heard
some
idle
tale
of
his
birth
believes
it
because
it
chimes
with
his
wishes
i
treated
him
with
the
scorn
he
deserved
i
would
have
driven
him
from
my
presence
but
he
was
armed
as
you
see
and
forced
me
hither
perhaps
to
murder
me
a
deed
he
might
have
accomplished
had
it
not
been
for
your
intervention
his
life
is
already
forfeit
for
an
attempt
of
the
same
sort
last
night
why
else
came
he
hither
for
what
else
did
he
drag
me
to
this
spot
let
him
answer
that
i
answer
it
replied
luke
raising
himself
from
the
bier
his
face
was
ghastly
as
the
corpse
over
which
he
leaned
i
had
a
deed
to
do
which
i
wished
you
to
witness
it
was
a
wild
conception
but
the
means
by
which
i
have
acquired
the
information
of
my
rights
were
wild
ranulph
we
are
both
the
slaves
of
fate
you
have
received
your
summons
hither
i
have
had
mine
your
father
ghost
called
you
my
spectral
hand
beckoned
me
both
are
arrived
one
thing
more
remains
and
my
mission
is
completed
saying
which
he
drew
forth
the
skeleton
hand
and
having
first
taken
the
from
the
finger
he
placed
the
withered
limb
upon
the
left
breast
of
his
father
body
rest
there
he
cried
for
ever
will
you
suffer
that
said
lady
rookwood
tauntingly
to
her
son
no
replied
ranulph
such
profanation
of
the
dead
shall
not
be
endured
were
he
ten
times
my
brother
stand
aside
added
he
advancing
towards
the
bier
and
motioning
luke
away
withdraw
your
hand
from
my
father
body
and
remove
what
you
have
placed
upon
it
i
will
neither
remove
it
nor
suffer
it
to
be
removed
returned
luke
was
for
that
purpose
i
came
hither
was
to
that
hand
he
was
united
in
life
in
death
he
shall
not
be
divided
from
it
such
irreverence
shall
not
be
exclaimed
ranulph
seizing
luke
with
one
hand
and
snatching
at
the
cereclothes
with
the
other
remove
it
or
by
heaven
leave
go
your
hold
said
luke
in
a
voice
of
thunder
you
strive
in
vain
ranulph
ineffectually
attempted
to
push
him
backwards
and
shaking
away
the
grasp
that
was
fixed
upon
his
collar
seized
his
brother
wrist
so
as
to
prevent
the
accomplishment
of
his
purpose
in
this
unnatural
and
indecorous
strife
the
corpse
of
their
father
was
reft
of
its
covering
and
the
hand
discovered
lying
upon
the
pallid
breast
and
as
if
the
wanton
impiety
of
their
conduct
called
forth
an
immediate
rebuke
even
from
the
dead
a
frown
seemed
to
pass
over
sir
features
as
their
angry
glances
fell
in
that
direction
this
startling
effect
was
occasioned
by
the
approach
of
lady
rookwood
whose
shadow
falling
over
the
brow
and
visage
of
the
deceased
produced
the
appearance
we
have
described
simultaneously
quitting
each
other
with
a
deep
sense
of
shame
mingled
with
remorse
both
remained
their
eyes
fixed
upon
the
dead
whose
repose
they
had
violated
folding
the
graveclothes
decently
over
the
body
luke
prepared
to
depart
hold
cried
lady
rookwood
you
go
not
hence
my
brother
ranulph
will
not
oppose
my
departure
returned
luke
who
else
shall
prevent
it
that
will
i
cried
a
sharp
voice
behind
him
and
ere
he
could
turn
to
ascertain
from
whom
the
exclamation
proceeded
luke
felt
himself
grappled
by
two
nervous
assailants
who
snatching
the
pistol
from
his
hold
fast
pinioned
his
arms
this
was
scarcely
the
work
of
a
moment
and
he
was
a
prisoner
before
he
could
offer
any
resistance
a
strong
smile
of
exultation
evinced
lady
rookwood
satisfaction
bravo
my
lads
bravo
cried
coates
stepping
forward
for
he
it
was
under
whose
skilful
superintendence
the
seizure
had
been
effected
famously
managed
my
father
the
runners
could
have
done
it
better
hand
me
that
pistol
loaded
i
see
slugs
no
doubt
oh
he
a
precious
rascal
search
him
turn
his
pockets
inside
out
while
i
speak
to
her
ladyship
saying
which
the
brisk
attorney
enchanted
with
the
feat
he
had
performed
approached
lady
rookwood
with
a
profound
bow
and
an
amazing
smirk
of
just
in
time
to
prevent
mischief
said
he
hope
your
ladyship
does
not
suffer
any
inconvenience
from
the
alarm
beg
pardon
annoyance
i
meant
to
say
which
this
horrible
outrage
must
have
occasioned
excessively
disagreeable
this
sort
of
thing
to
a
lady
at
any
time
but
at
a
period
like
this
more
than
usually
provoking
however
we
have
the
villain
safe
enough
very
lucky
i
happened
to
be
in
the
way
perhaps
your
ladyship
would
like
to
know
how
i
discovered
not
now
replied
lady
rookwood
checking
the
volubility
of
the
man
of
law
i
thank
you
coates
for
the
service
you
have
rendered
me
you
will
now
add
materially
to
the
obligation
by
removing
the
prisoner
with
all
convenient
despatch
certainly
if
your
ladyship
wishes
it
shall
i
detain
him
a
close
prisoner
in
the
hall
for
the
night
or
remove
him
at
once
to
the
house
in
the
village
where
you
please
so
you
do
it
quickly
replied
lady
rookwood
noticing
with
great
uneasiness
the
agitated
manner
of
her
son
and
apprehensive
lest
in
the
presence
of
so
many
witnesses
he
might
say
or
do
something
prejudicial
to
their
interests
nor
were
her
fears
groundless
as
coates
was
about
to
return
to
the
prisoner
he
was
arrested
by
the
voice
of
ranulph
commanding
him
to
stay
coates
said
he
however
appearances
may
be
against
this
man
he
is
no
robber
you
must
therefore
release
him
eh
day
what
that
release
him
sir
ranulph
yes
sir
i
tell
you
he
came
here
neither
with
the
intent
to
rob
nor
to
offer
violence
that
is
false
ranulph
replied
lady
rookwood
i
was
dragged
hither
by
him
at
the
peril
of
my
life
he
is
coates
prisoner
on
another
charge
unquestionably
your
ladyship
is
perfectly
right
i
have
a
warrant
against
him
for
assaulting
hugh
badger
the
keeper
and
for
other
misdemeanors
i
will
myself
be
responsible
for
his
appearance
to
that
charge
replied
ranulph
now
sir
at
once
release
him
at
your
peril
exclaimed
lady
rookwood
well
really
muttered
the
astonished
attorney
this
is
the
most
perplexing
proceeding
i
ever
witnessed
ranulph
said
lady
rookwood
sternly
to
her
son
beware
how
you
thwart
me
yes
sir
ranulph
let
me
venture
to
advise
you
as
a
friend
not
to
thwart
her
ladyship
whispered
the
attorney
indeed
she
is
in
the
right
but
seeing
his
advice
unheeded
coates
withdrew
to
a
little
distance
i
will
not
see
injustice
done
to
my
father
son
replied
ranulph
in
a
low
tone
why
would
you
detain
him
why
returned
she
our
safety
demands
it
our
honor
our
honor
demands
his
instant
liberation
each
moment
he
remains
in
those
bonds
sullies
its
purity
i
will
free
him
myself
from
his
fetters
and
brave
my
curse
foolish
boy
you
incurred
your
miserable
anathema
for
a
lighter
cause
than
this
our
honor
cries
aloud
for
his
destruction
have
i
not
been
injured
in
the
nicest
point
a
woman
can
be
injured
shall
i
lend
my
name
to
mockery
and
scorn
by
base
acknowledgment
of
such
deceit
or
will
you
where
would
be
my
honor
then
stripped
of
my
fair
estates
my
son
myself
beggars
dependent
on
the
bounty
of
an
upstart
does
honor
ask
you
to
bear
this
it
is
a
phantom
sense
of
honor
unsubstantial
as
your
father
shade
of
which
you
just
now
spoke
that
would
prompt
you
to
do
otherwise
do
not
evoke
his
awful
spirit
mother
cried
ranulph
with
a
shudder
do
not
arouse
his
wrath
do
not
arouse
wrath
returned
lady
rookwood
i
am
the
more
to
be
feared
think
of
eleanor
mowbray
the
bar
between
your
nuptials
is
removed
would
you
raise
up
a
greater
impediment
enough
mother
more
than
enough
you
have
decided
though
not
convinced
me
detain
him
within
the
house
if
you
will
until
the
morrow
in
the
meantime
i
will
consider
over
my
line
of
conduct
is
this
then
your
resolve
it
is
coates
said
ranulph
calling
the
attorney
who
had
been
an
inquisitive
spectator
though
luckily
not
an
auditor
of
this
interview
unbind
the
prisoner
and
bring
him
hither
is
it
your
ladyship
pleasure
asked
coates
who
regretted
exceedingly
that
he
could
not
please
both
parties
lady
rookwood
signified
her
assent
by
a
slight
gesture
in
the
affirmative
your
bidding
shall
be
done
sir
ranulph
said
coates
bowing
and
departing
ranulph
echoed
lady
rookwood
with
strong
emphasis
marked
you
that
body
o
me
muttered
the
attorney
this
is
the
most
extraordinary
family
to
be
sure
make
way
gentlemen
if
you
please
added
he
pushing
through
the
crowd
towards
the
prisoner
having
described
what
took
place
between
lady
rookwood
and
her
son
in
one
part
of
the
room
we
must
now
briefly
narrate
some
incidental
occurrences
in
the
other
the
alarm
of
a
robber
having
been
taken
spread
with
great
celerity
through
the
house
and
almost
all
its
inmates
rushed
into
the
room
including
small
titus
tyrconnel
and
jack
palmer
odsbodikins
are
you
there
honey
said
titus
who
discovered
his
ally
the
bird
caught
you
see
caught
be
d
d
replied
jack
bluffly
so
i
see
all
his
own
fault
infernal
folly
to
come
here
at
such
a
time
as
this
however
it
be
helped
now
he
must
make
the
best
of
it
and
as
to
that
sneaking
if
i
do
serve
him
out
for
his
officiousness
one
of
these
days
my
name
not
jack
palmer
och
cushlamacree
did
i
ever
why
what
the
boy
to
you
jack
fair
play
a
jewel
and
surely
coates
only
did
his
duty
i
sorry
captured
for
his
relationship
to
sir
piers
and
because
i
think
be
tucked
up
for
his
pains
and
moreover
i
could
forgive
the
poaching
but
as
to
the
breaking
into
a
house
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
och
it
a
plaguy
bad
look
i
afraid
he
worse
than
i
thought
him
a
group
of
the
tenantry
many
of
whom
were
in
a
state
of
intoxication
had
in
the
meantime
formed
themselves
round
the
prisoner
whatever
might
be
the
nature
of
his
thoughts
no
apprehension
was
visible
in
luke
countenance
he
stood
erect
amidst
the
assemblage
his
tall
form
towering
above
them
all
and
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
movements
of
lady
rookwood
and
her
son
he
had
perceived
the
anguish
of
the
latter
and
the
vehemence
of
the
former
attributing
both
to
their
real
causes
the
taunts
and
jeers
threats
and
insolent
inquiries
of
the
hinds
who
thronged
around
him
passed
unheeded
yet
one
voice
in
his
ear
sharp
as
the
sting
of
a
serpent
made
him
start
it
was
that
of
the
sexton
you
have
done
well
said
peter
have
you
not
your
fetters
are
i
hope
to
your
liking
well
a
wilful
man
must
have
his
own
way
and
perhaps
the
next
time
you
will
be
content
to
follow
my
advice
you
must
now
free
yourself
the
best
way
you
can
from
these
moabites
and
i
promise
you
it
will
be
no
easy
matter
ha
ha
peter
withdrew
into
the
crowd
and
luke
vainly
endeavoring
to
discover
his
retreating
figure
caught
the
eye
of
jack
palmer
fixed
upon
himself
with
a
peculiar
and
very
significant
expression
at
this
moment
coates
made
his
appearance
bring
forward
the
prisoner
said
the
man
of
law
to
his
two
assistants
and
luke
was
accordingly
hurried
along
coates
using
his
best
efforts
to
keep
back
the
crowd
it
was
during
the
pressure
that
luke
heard
a
voice
whisper
in
his
ear
never
fear
all
right
and
turning
his
head
he
became
aware
of
the
propinquity
of
jack
palmer
the
latter
elevated
his
eyebrows
with
a
gesture
of
silence
and
luke
passed
on
as
if
nothing
had
occurred
he
was
presently
confronted
with
lady
rookwood
and
her
son
and
notwithstanding
the
efforts
of
coates
seconded
by
some
few
others
the
crowd
grew
dense
around
them
remove
his
fetters
said
ranulph
and
his
manacles
were
removed
you
will
consent
to
remain
here
a
prisoner
till
i
consent
to
nothing
replied
luke
i
am
in
your
hands
he
does
not
deserve
your
clemency
sir
ranulph
interposed
coates
let
him
take
his
own
course
said
lady
rookwood
he
will
reap
the
benefit
of
it
anon
will
you
pledge
yourself
not
to
depart
asked
ranulph
of
course
cried
the
attorney
to
be
sure
he
will
ha
ha
no
returned
luke
haughtily
i
will
not
and
you
will
detain
me
at
your
proper
peril
better
and
better
exclaimed
the
attorney
this
is
the
highest
joke
i
ever
heard
i
shall
detain
you
then
in
custody
until
proper
inquiries
can
be
made
said
ranulph
to
your
care
coates
and
to
that
of
tyrconnel
whom
i
must
request
to
lend
you
his
assistance
i
commit
the
charge
and
i
must
further
request
that
you
will
show
him
every
attention
which
his
situation
will
permit
remove
him
we
have
a
sacred
duty
to
the
dead
to
fulfil
to
which
even
justice
to
the
living
must
give
way
disperse
this
crowd
and
let
instant
preparations
be
made
for
the
completion
of
the
ceremonial
you
understand
me
sir
ranulph
rookwood
said
luke
sternly
as
he
departed
you
have
another
a
more
sacred
office
to
perform
fulfil
your
duty
to
your
father
son
away
with
him
cried
lady
rookwood
i
am
out
of
all
patience
with
this
trilling
follow
me
to
my
chamber
added
she
to
her
son
passing
towards
the
door
the
concourse
of
spectators
who
had
listened
to
this
extraordinary
scene
in
astonishment
made
way
for
her
instantly
and
she
left
the
room
accompanied
by
ranulph
the
prisoner
was
led
out
by
the
other
door
botheration
cried
titus
to
coates
as
they
followed
in
the
wake
why
did
he
choose
out
me
i
lose
the
funeral
entirely
by
his
arrangement
that
you
will
replied
palmer
shall
i
be
your
deputy
no
no
returned
coates
i
will
have
no
other
than
tyrconnel
it
was
sir
ranulph
express
wish
that
the
devil
of
it
returned
titus
and
i
who
was
to
have
been
chief
mourner
and
have
made
all
the
preparations
am
to
be
omitted
i
wish
sir
ranulph
had
stayed
till
what
could
bring
him
here
to
spoil
all
it
cursedly
provoking
cursed
provoking
echoed
jack
but
then
there
no
help
so
i
must
make
the
best
of
it
returned
the
irishman
body
o
me
said
coates
there
something
in
all
this
that
i
fathom
as
to
keeping
the
prisoner
that
all
moonshine
but
i
suppose
we
shall
know
the
whole
drift
of
it
ay
replied
jack
with
a
meaning
smile
thou
art
very
plain
my
trade
is
to
flatter
the
dead
not
the
living
i
am
a
webster

the

sowle
haywood
of
the
night
was
wild
and
stormy
the
day
had
been
sultry
with
a
lurid
sky
hanging
like
a
vast
galvanic
plate
over
the
face
of
nature
as
evening
drew
on
everything
betokened
the
coming
tempest
unerring
indications
of
its
approach
were
noted
by
the
weatherwise
at
the
hall
the
swallow
was
seen
to
skim
the
surface
of
the
pool
so
closely
that
he
ruffled
its
placid
mirror
as
he
passed
and
then
sharply
darting
round
and
round
with
twittering
scream
he
winged
his
rapid
flight
to
his
home
beneath
the
barn
eaves
the
kine
that
had
herded
to
the
margin
of
the
water
and
sought
by
splashing
to
relieve
themselves
from
the
keen
persecution
of
their
myriad
insect
tormentors
wended
stallwards
undriven
and
deeply
lowing
the
deer
that
at
twilight
had
trooped
thither
also
for
refreshment
suddenly
with
expanded
nostrils
snuffed
the
air
and
bounded
off
to
their
coverts
amidst
the
sheltering
fernbrake
the
rooks
obstreperous
of
wing
in
crowds
combined
cawed
in
a
way
that
as
plainly
as
words
could
have
done
bespoke
their
apprehension
and
were
seen
some
hovering
and
beating
the
air
with
flapping
pinion
others
shooting
upwards
in
mid
space
as
if
to
reconnoitre
the
weather
while
others
again
were
croaking
to
their
mates
in
loud
discordant
tone
from
the
highest
branches
of
the
all
seemingly
as
anxious
and
as
busy
as
mariners
before
a
gale
of
wind
at
sunset
the
hazy
vapors
which
had
obscured
the
horizon
throughout
the
day
rose
up
in
spiral
volumes
like
smoke
from
a
burning
forest
and
becoming
gradually
condensed
assumed
the
form
of
huge
billowy
masses
which
reflecting
the
sun
light
changed
as
the
sinking
orb
declined
from
purple
to
and
thence
to
ashy
angry
gray
night
rushed
onwards
like
a
sable
steed
there
was
a
dead
calm
the
stillness
was
undisturbed
save
by
an
intermittent
sighing
wind
which
hollow
as
a
murmur
from
the
grave
died
as
it
rose
at
once
the
gray
clouds
turned
to
an
inky
blackness
a
single
sharp
intensely
vivid
flash
shot
from
the
bosom
of
the
rack
sheer
downwards
and
struck
the
earth
with
a
report
like
that
of
a
piece
of
ordnance
in
ten
minutes
it
was
dunnest
night
and
a
rattling
the
progress
of
the
storm
was
watched
with
infinite
apprehension
by
the
crowd
of
tenantry
assembled
in
the
great
hall
and
loud
and
frequent
were
the
ejaculations
uttered
as
each
succeeding
peal
burst
over
their
heads
there
was
however
one
amongst
the
assemblage
who
seemed
to
enjoy
the
uproar
a
kindred
excitement
appeared
to
blaze
in
his
glances
as
he
looked
upon
the
storm
without
this
was
peter
bradley
he
stood
close
by
the
window
and
shaded
not
his
eyes
even
before
the
fiercest
flashes
a
grin
of
unnatural
exhilaration
played
upon
his
features
and
he
seemed
to
exult
in
and
to
court
the
tempestuous
horrors
which
affected
the
most
hardy
amongst
his
companions
with
consternation
and
made
all
shrink
trembling
into
the
recesses
of
the
room
conduct
was
not
unobserved
nor
his
reputation
for
unholy
dealing
forgotten
to
some
he
was
almost
as
much
an
object
of
dread
as
the
storm
itself
didst
ever
see
the
like
o
that
said
farmer
burtenshaw
one
of
the
guests
whose
round
honest
face
good
wine
had
recently
empurpled
but
fear
had
now
mottled
white
addressing
a
neighbor
didst
ever
hear
of
any
man
that
were
a
christian
laughing
in
the
very
face
o
a
with
the
lightnin
fit
to
put
out
his
eyes
and
the
rattle
above
ready
to
break
the
drums
o
his
ears
i
always
thought
peter
bradley
was
not
exactly
what
he
ought
to
be
and
now
i
am
sure
on
it
for
my
part
i
think
neighbor
burtenshaw
returned
the
other
that
this
great
burst
of
weather
all
of
his
raising
for
in
all
my
born
days
i
never
see
such
a
and
hope
never
to
see
the
like
of
it
again
i
heard
my
grandfather
tell
of
folk
as
could
command
wind
and
rain
and
mayhap
peter
may
have
the
power
we
all
know
he
can
do
more
nor
any
other
man
we
know
at
all
events
replied
burtenshaw
that
he
lives
like
no
other
man
that
he
spends
night
after
night
by
himself
in
that
dreary
churchyard
that
he
keeps
no
living
thing
except
an
old
terrier
dog
in
his
crazy
cottage
and
that
he
never
asks
a
body
into
his
house
from
one
year
end
to
another
i
never
crossed
his
threshold
these
twenty
years
but
continued
he
mysteriously
i
happened
to
pass
the
house
one
dark
dismal
night
and
there
what
dost
think
i
see
through
the
window
what
what
didst
see
peter
bradley
sitting
with
a
great
book
open
on
his
knees
it
were
a
bible
i
think
and
he
crying
like
a
child
art
sure
o
that
the
tears
were
falling
fast
upon
the
leaves
returned
burtenshaw
but
when
i
knocked
at
the
door
he
hastily
shut
up
the
book
and
ordered
me
to
be
gone
in
a
surly
tone
as
if
he
were
ashamed
of
being
caught
in
the
fact
i
thought
no
tear
had
ever
dropped
from
his
eye
said
the
other
why
he
laughed
when
his
daughter
susan
went
off
at
the
hall
and
when
she
died
folks
said
he
received
to
say
nought
about
it
were
a
bad
business
anyhow
and
now
that
his
grandson
luke
be
taken
in
the
fact
of
housebreaking
he
minds
it
no
more
not
he
than
if
nothing
had
happened
do
be
too
sure
of
that
replied
burtenshaw
he
may
be
scheming
summat
all
this
time
well
i
known
peter
bradley
now
these
years
and
excepting
that
one
night
i
never
saw
any
good
about
him
and
never
heard
of
nobody
who
could
tell
who
he
be
or
where
he
do
come
from
one
thing
certain
at
least
replied
the
other
farmer
he
were
never
born
at
rookwood
how
he
came
here
the
devil
only
knows
save
us
what
a
crash
this
storm
be
all
of
his
raising
i
tell
he
be
what
he
certainly
will
be
interposed
another
speaker
in
a
louder
tone
and
with
less
of
apprehension
in
his
manner
than
his
comrade
probably
from
his
nerves
being
better
fortified
with
strong
liquor
dost
thou
think
samuel
plant
as
how
providence
would
entrust
the
like
o
him
with
the
command
of
the
elements
no
no
it
rank
blasphemy
to
suppose
such
a
thing
and
i
too
much
of
the
true
catholic
and
apostate
church
about
me
to
stand
by
and
hear
that
said
maybe
then
he
gets
his
power
from
the
prince
of
darkness
replied
plant
no
man
else
could
go
on
as
he
does
only
look
at
him
he
seems
to
be
watching
for
the
thunderbowt
i
wish
he
may
catch
it
then
returned
the
other
that
an
evil
wish
simon
toft
and
thou
mayst
repent
it
not
i
replied
toft
it
would
be
a
good
clearance
to
the
neighborhood
to
get
rid
o
th
old
croaking
curmudgeon
whether
or
not
peter
overheard
the
conversation
we
pretend
not
to
say
but
at
that
moment
a
blaze
of
lightning
showed
him
staring
fiercely
at
the
group
as
i
live
he
overheard
you
simon
exclaimed
plant
i
would
be
in
your
skin
for
a
trifle
nor
i
added
burtenshaw
let
him
overhear
me
answered
toft
who
cares
he
shall
hear
summat
worth
listening
to
i
not
afraid
o
him
or
his
arts
were
they
as
black
as
beelzebuth
own
and
to
show
you
i
not
i
go
and
have
a
crack
with
him
on
the
spot
a
fool
for
thy
pains
if
thou
dost
friend
toft
returned
plant
that
all
i
can
say
be
advised
by
me
and
stay
here
seconded
burtenshaw
endeavoring
to
hold
him
back
but
toft
would
not
be
advised
kings
may
be
blest
but
he
was
glorious
all
the
ills
of
life
victorious
staggering
up
to
peter
he
laid
a
hard
grasp
upon
his
shoulder
and
thus
forcibly
soliciting
his
attention
burst
into
a
loud
but
peter
was
or
affected
to
be
too
much
occupied
to
look
at
him
what
dost
see
man
that
thou
starest
so
it
comes
it
comes
the
rain
the
rain
a
torrent
a
deluge
ha
ha
blessed
is
the
corpse
the
rain
rains
on
sir
piers
may
be
drenched
through
his
leaden
covering
by
such
a
downfall
as
that
splash
splash
fire
and
water
and
thunder
all
together
is
not
that
fine
ha
ha
the
heavens
will
weep
for
him
though
friends
shed
not
a
tear
when
did
a
great
man
heir
feel
sympathy
for
his
sire
decease
when
did
his
widow
mourn
when
doth
any
man
regret
his
fellow
never
he
rejoiceth
he
maketh
glad
in
his
inmost
heart
he
can
not
help
it
it
is
nature
we
all
pray
for
we
all
delight
in
each
other
destruction
we
were
created
to
do
so
or
why
else
should
we
act
thus
i
never
wept
for
any
man
death
but
i
have
often
laughed
natural
sympathy
out
on
the
phrase
the
distant
heavens
the
senseless
trees
the
impenetrable
stones
shall
regret
you
more
than
man
shall
bewail
your
death
with
more
sincerity
ay
is
well
rain
on
splash
splash
it
will
cool
the
down
down
buckets
and
pails
ha
ha
there
was
a
pause
during
which
the
sexton
almost
exhausted
by
the
frenzy
in
which
he
had
suffered
himself
to
be
involved
seemed
insensible
to
all
around
him
i
tell
you
what
said
burtenshaw
to
plant
i
have
always
thought
there
was
more
in
peter
bradley
nor
appears
on
the
outside
he
is
not
what
he
seems
to
be
take
my
word
on
it
lord
love
you
do
you
think
a
man
such
as
he
pretends
to
be
could
talk
in
that
sort
of
way
about
simpering
no
such
thing
when
peter
recovered
his
insane
merriment
broke
out
afresh
having
only
acquired
fury
by
the
pause
look
out
look
out
cried
he
hark
to
the
thunder
list
to
the
rain
marked
ye
that
flash
marked
ye
the
and
the
bird
upon
the
roof
is
the
rook
the
great
bird
of
the
house
that
hath
borne
away
the
soul
of
the
departed
there
there
can
you
not
see
it
it
sits
and
croaks
through
storm
and
rain
and
never
heeds
at
all
and
wherefore
should
it
heed
see
it
flaps
its
broad
black
wings
it
croaks
ha
ha
it
comes
it
comes
and
driven
it
might
be
by
the
terror
of
the
storm
from
more
secure
quarters
a
bird
at
this
instant
was
dashed
against
the
window
and
fell
to
the
ground
that
a
call
continued
peter
it
will
be
over
soon
and
we
must
set
out
the
dead
will
not
need
to
tarry
look
at
that
trail
of
fire
along
the
avenue
dost
see
yon
line
of
sparkles
like
a
rocket
tail
the
path
the
corpse
will
take
hermes
flickering
fire
robin
goodfellow
dancing
light
or
the
blue
flame
of
the
which
i
saw
flitting
to
the
churchyard
last
week
was
not
so
pretty
a
sight
ha
ha
you
asked
me
for
a
song
a
moment
ago
you
shall
have
one
now
without
asking
and
without
waiting
to
consult
the
inclinations
of
his
comrades
peter
broke
into
the
following
wild
strain
with
all
the
fervor
of
a
improvisatore
the
lambere
flamma
ταφος
et
circum
funera
pasci
through
the
midnight
gloom
did
a
pale
blue
light
to
the
churchyard
mirk
wing
its
lonesome
flight
thrice
it
floated
those
old
walls
round
thrice
it
paused
till
the
grave
it
found
over
the
sod
it
glanced
over
the
earth
it
danced
like
a
torch
in
the
quivering
never
was
seen
so
gay
a
thing
never
was
seen
so
blithe
a
sight
as
the
midnight
dance
of
that
blue
light
now
what
of
that
pale
blue
flame
dost
know
canst
tell
where
it
comes
from
or
where
it
will
go
is
it
the
soul
released
from
clay
over
the
earth
that
takes
its
way
and
tarries
a
moment
in
mirth
and
glee
where
the
corse
it
hath
quitted
interred
shall
be
or
is
it
the
trick
of
some
fanciful
sprite
that
taketh
in
mortal
mischance
delight
and
marketh
the
road
the
coffin
shall
go
and
the
spot
where
the
dead
shall
be
soon
laid
low
ask
him
who
can
answer
these
questions
aright
i
know
not
the
cause
of
that
pale
blue
light
i
ca
say
i
like
thy
song
master
peter
said
toft
as
the
sexton
finished
his
stave
but
if
thou
see
a
as
thou
thy
pale
blue
flame
whose
death
doth
it
betoken
eh
thine
own
returned
peter
sharply
mine
thou
lying
old
cheat
dost
dare
to
say
that
to
my
face
why
as
hale
and
hearty
as
ever
a
man
in
the
house
dost
think
there
no
life
and
vigor
in
this
arm
thou
drivelling
old
dotard
upon
which
toft
seized
peter
by
the
throat
with
an
energy
that
but
for
the
timely
intervention
of
the
company
who
rushed
to
his
assistance
the
prophet
might
himself
have
anticipated
the
doom
he
prognosticated
released
from
the
grasp
of
toft
who
was
held
back
by
the
bystanders
peter
again
broke
forth
into
his
eldritch
laugh
and
staring
right
into
the
face
of
his
adversary
with
eyes
glistening
and
hands
uplifted
as
if
in
the
act
of
calling
down
an
imprecation
on
his
head
he
screamed
in
a
shrill
and
discordant
voice
soh
you
will
not
take
my
warning
you
revile
me
you
flout
me
is
well
your
fate
shall
prove
a
warning
to
all
unbelievers
shall
remember
this
night
though
will
not
fool
fool
your
doom
has
long
been
sealed
i
saw
your
wraith
choose
out
its
last
lodgment
on
halloween
i
know
the
spot
your
grave
is
dug
already
ha
ha
and
with
renewed
laughter
peter
rushed
out
of
the
room
did
i
not
caution
thee
not
to
provoke
him
friend
toft
said
plant
it
ill
playing
with
but
do
let
him
fly
off
in
that
tantrum
one
of
ye
go
after
him
that
will
i
replied
burtenshaw
and
he
departed
in
search
of
the
sexton
i
advise
thee
to
make
it
up
with
peter
so
soon
as
thou
canst
neighbor
continued
plant
he
a
bad
friend
but
a
worse
enemy
why
what
harm
can
he
do
me
returned
toft
who
however
was
not
without
some
misgivings
if
i
must
die
i
ca
help
it
i
shall
go
none
the
sooner
for
him
even
if
he
speak
the
truth
which
i
do
think
he
do
and
if
i
must
i
go
unprepared
only
i
think
as
how
if
it
pleased
providence
i
could
have
wished
to
keep
my
old
missus
company
some
few
years
longer
and
see
those
bits
of
lasses
of
mine
grow
up
into
women
and
respectably
provided
for
but
his
will
be
done
i
leave
quite
penniless
and
there
one
eye
at
least
sure
wo
be
dry
at
my
departure
here
the
stout
heart
of
toft
gave
way
and
he
shed
some
few
natural
tears
which
however
he
speedily
brushed
away
i
tell
you
what
neighbors
continued
he
i
think
we
may
all
as
well
be
thinking
of
going
to
our
own
homes
for
to
my
mind
we
shall
never
reach
the
churchyard
that
never
will
exclaimed
a
voice
behind
him
and
toft
turning
round
again
met
the
glance
of
peter
come
come
master
peter
cried
the
farmer
this
be
ugly
jesting
ax
pardon
for
my
share
of
it
sorry
for
what
i
did
so
give
us
thy
hand
man
and
think
no
more
about
it
peter
extended
his
claw
and
the
parties
were
apparently
once
more
upon
terms
of
friendship
funeral
in
northern
customs
duty
was
exprest
to
friends
departed
by
their
funeral
feast
though
i
consulted
hollingshed
and
stow
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
know
who
to
refresh
the
attendants
to
the
grave
burnt
claret
first
or

durand
a
supply
of
spirits
was
here
introduced
lights
were
brought
at
the
same
time
and
placed
upon
a
long
oak
table
the
party
gathering
round
it
was
speedily
dissipated
and
even
the
storm
disregarded
in
the
copious
libations
that
ensued
at
this
juncture
a
loiterer
appeared
in
the
hall
his
movements
were
unnoticed
by
all
excepting
the
sexton
who
watched
his
proceedings
with
some
curiosity
the
person
walked
to
the
window
appearing
so
far
as
could
be
discovered
to
eye
the
storm
with
great
impatience
he
then
paced
the
hall
rapidly
backwards
and
forwards
and
peter
fancied
he
could
detect
sounds
of
disappointment
in
his
muttered
exclamations
again
he
returned
to
the
window
as
if
to
ascertain
the
probable
duration
of
the
shower
it
was
a
hopeless
endeavor
all
was
without
the
lightning
was
now
only
seen
at
long
intervals
but
the
rain
still
audibly
descended
in
torrents
apparently
seeing
the
impossibility
of
controlling
the
elements
the
person
approached
the
table
what
think
you
of
the
night
mr
palmer
asked
the
sexton
of
jack
for
he
was
the
anxious
investigator
of
the
weather
do
know
ca
say
set
in
i
think
cursed
unlucky
for
the
funeral
i
mean
we
shall
be
drowned
if
we
go
and
drunk
if
we
stay
rejoined
peter
but
never
fear
it
will
hold
up
depend
upon
it
long
before
we
can
start
where
have
they
put
the
prisoner
asked
he
with
a
sudden
change
of
manner
i
know
the
room
but
ca
describe
it
it
two
or
three
doors
down
the
lower
corridor
of
the
eastern
gallery
good
who
are
on
guard
titus
tyrconnel
and
that
coates
enough
come
come
master
peter
roared
toft
let
have
another
stave
give
us
one
of
your
odd
snatches
no
more
or
that
sort
of
thing
something
lively
something
jolly
ha
ha
a
good
move
shouted
jack
a
lively
song
from
lillibullero
from
a
ha
ha
my
songs
are
all
of
a
sort
returned
peter
i
am
seldom
asked
to
sing
a
second
time
however
you
are
welcome
to
the
merriest
i
have
and
preparing
himself
like
certain
other
accomplished
vocalists
with
a
few
preliminary
hems
and
haws
he
struck
forth
the
following
doleful
ditty
the
old
oak
coffin
sic
ego
componi
versus
in
ossa
tibullus
in
a
churchyard
upon
the
sward
a
coffin
there
was
laid
and
leaning
stood
beside
the
wood
a
sexton
on
his
spade
a
coffin
old
and
black
it
was
and
fashioned
curiously
with
quaint
device
of
carved
oak
in
hideous
fantasie
for
here
was
wrought
the
sculptured
thought
of
a
tormented
face
with
serpents
lithe
that
round
it
writhe
in
folded
strict
embrace
grim
visages
of
grinning
fiends
were
at
each
corner
set
and
emblematic
scrolls
and
bones
together
met
ah
welladay
that
sexton
gray
unto
himself
did
cry
beneath
that
lid
much
lieth
hid
much
awful
mysterie
it
is
an
ancient
coffin
from
the
abbey
that
stood
here
perchance
it
holds
an
abbot
bones
perchance
those
of
a
frere
in
digging
deep
where
monks
do
sleep
beneath
yon
cloister
shrined
that
coffin
old
within
the
mould
it
was
my
chance
to
find
the
costly
carvings
of
the
lid
i
scraped
full
carefully
in
hope
to
get
at
name
or
date
yet
nothing
could
i
see
with
pick
and
spade
i
plied
my
trade
for
sixty
years
and
more
yet
never
found
beneath
the
ground
shell
strange
as
that
before
full
many
coffins
have
i
seen
have
seen
them
deep
or
flat
fantastical
in
fashion
none
fantastical
as
that
and
saying
so
with
heavy
blow
the
lid
he
shattered
wide
and
pale
with
fright
a
ghastly
sight
that
sexton
gray
espied
a
miserable
sight
it
was
that
loathsome
corpse
to
see
the
last
last
dreary
darksome
stage
of
humanity
though
all
was
gone
save
reeky
bone
a
green
and
grisly
heap
with
scarce
a
trace
of
fleshly
face
strange
posture
did
it
keep
the
hands
were
clenched
the
teeth
were
wrenched
as
if
the
wretch
had
risen
after
death
had
his
breath
to
strive
and
burst
his
prison
the
neck
was
bent
the
nails
were
rent
no
limb
or
joint
was
straight
together
glued
with
blood
imbued
black
and
coagulate
and
as
the
sexton
stooped
him
down
to
lift
the
coffin
plank
his
fingers
were
defiled
all
with
slimy
substance
dank
ah
welladay
that
sexton
gray
unto
himself
did
cry
full
well
i
see
how
fate
decree
foredoomed
this
wretch
to
die
a
living
man
a
breathing
man
within
the
coffin
thrust
alack
alack
the
agony
ere
he
returned
to
dust
a
vision
drear
did
then
appear
unto
that
sexton
eyes
like
that
poor
wight
before
him
straight
he
in
a
coffin
lies
he
lieth
in
a
trance
within
that
coffin
close
and
fast
yet
though
he
sleepeth
now
he
feels
he
shall
awake
at
last
the
coffin
then
by
reverend
men
is
borne
with
footsteps
slow
where
tapers
shine
before
the
shrine
where
breathes
the
requiem
low
and
for
the
dead
the
prayer
is
said
for
the
soul
that
is
flown
then
all
is
drowned
in
hollow
sound
the
earth
is
him
thrown
he
draweth
breath
he
wakes
from
death
to
life
more
horrible
to
agony
such
agony
no
living
tongue
may
tell
die
die
he
must
that
wretched
one
he
struggles
strives
in
vain
no
more
heaven
light
nor
sunshine
bright
shall
he
behold
again
gramercy
lord
the
sexton
roared
awakening
suddenly
if
this
be
dream
yet
doth
it
seem
most
dreadful
so
to
die
oh
cast
my
body
in
the
sea
or
hurl
it
on
the
shore
but
nail
me
not
in
coffin
fast
no
grave
will
i
dig
more
it
was
not
difficult
to
discover
the
effect
produced
by
this
song
in
the
lengthened
faces
of
the
greater
part
of
the
audience
jack
palmer
however
laughed
loud
and
long
bravo
bravo
cried
he
that
suits
my
humor
exactly
i
ca
abide
the
thoughts
of
a
coffin
no
deal
box
for
me
a
gibbet
might
perhaps
serve
your
turn
as
well
muttered
the
sexton
adding
aloud
i
am
now
entitled
to
call
upon
you
a
song
a
song
ay
a
song
palmer
a
song
reiterated
the
hinds
yours
will
be
the
right
kind
of
thing
say
no
more
replied
jack
i
give
you
a
chant
composed
upon
dick
turpin
the
highwayman
it
no
great
shakes
to
be
sure
but
it
the
best
i
have
and
with
a
knowing
wink
at
the
sexton
he
commenced
in
the
true
nasal
whine
the
following
strain
one
foot
in
the
stirrup
or
turpin
first
fling
cum
esset
proposita
fuga
n
cicero
one
foot
in
the
stirrup
one
hand
in
the
rein
and
the
noose
be
my
portion
or
freedom
i
gain
oh
give
me
a
seat
in
my
saddle
once
more
and
these
bloodhounds
shall
find
that
the
chase
is
not
thus
muttered
dick
turpin
who
found
while
he
slept
that
the
philistines
old
on
his
slumbers
had
crept
had
entrapped
him
as
puss
on
her
form
you
ensnare
and
that
gone
were
his
snappers
and
gone
was
his
mare
how
dick
had
been
captured
is
readily
told
the
pursuit
had
been
hot
though
the
night
had
been
cold
so
at
daybreak
exhausted
he
sought
brief
repose
mid
the
thick
of
a
away
from
his
foes
but
in
vain
was
his
caution
in
vain
did
his
steed
ever
watchful
and
wakeful
in
moments
of
need
with
lip
and
with
hoof
on
her
master
cheek
press
he
slept
on
nor
heeded
the
warning
of
bess
zounds
cried
turpin
you
found
me
at
fault
and
the
highflying
highwayman
come
to
a
halt
you
have
turned
up
a
trump
for
i
weigh
well
my
weight
and
the
is
though
the
halter
fate
well
come
o
what
will
you
shall
own
when
all
past
that
dick
turpin
the
dauntless
was
game
to
the
last
but
before
we
go
further
i
hold
you
a
bet
that
one
foot
in
my
stirrup
you
wo
let
me
set
a
hundred
to
one
is
the
odds
will
stand
a
hundred
to
one
is
the
odds
command
here
a
handful
of
goldfinches
ready
to
fly
may
i
venture
a
foot
in
my
stirrup
to
try
as
he
carelessly
spoke
dick
directed
a
glance
at
his
courser
and
motioned
her
slyly
askance
you
might
tell
by
the
singular
toss
of
her
head
and
the
prick
of
her
ears
that
his
meaning
she
read
with
derision
at
first
was
dick
wager
received
and
his
error
at
starting
as
yet
unretrieved
but
when
from
his
pocket
the
shiners
he
drew
and
offered
to
make
up
the
hundred
to
two
there
were
havers
in
plenty
and
each
whispered
each
the
same
thing
though
varied
in
figure
of
speech
let
the
fool
act
his
folly
the
stirrup
of
bess
he
has
put
his
foot
already
we
guess
bess
was
brought
to
her
master
dick
steadfastly
gazed
at
the
eye
of
his
mare
then
his
foot
quick
upraised
his
toe
touched
the
stirrup
his
hand
grasped
the
rein
he
was
safe
on
the
back
of
his
courser
again
as
the
clarion
and
shrill
was
the
neigh
of
black
bess
as
she
answered
his
cry
beset
me
ye
bloodhounds
in
rear
and
in
van
my
foot
in
the
stirrup
and
catch
me
who
can
there
was
riding
and
gibing
mid
rabble
and
rout
and
the
old
woods
the
philistines
shout
there
was
hurling
and
whirling
brake
and
brier
but
the
course
of
dick
turpin
was
swift
as
heaven
fire
whipping
spurring
and
straining
would
nothing
avail
dick
laughed
at
their
curses
and
scoffed
at
their
wail
my
foot
in
the
stirrup
thus
rang
his
last
cry
bess
has
answered
my
call
now
her
mettle
we
try
uproarious
applause
followed
jack
song
when
the
joviality
of
the
mourners
was
interrupted
by
a
summons
to
attend
in
the
silence
was
at
once
completely
restored
and
in
the
best
order
they
could
assume
they
followed
their
leader
peter
bradley
jack
palmer
was
amongst
the
last
to
enter
and
remained
a
not
incurious
spectator
of
a
by
no
means
common
scene
preparations
had
been
made
to
give
due
solemnity
to
the
ceremonial
the
leaden
coffin
was
fastened
down
and
enclosed
in
an
outer
case
of
oak
upon
the
lid
of
which
stood
a
massive
silver
flagon
filled
with
burnt
claret
called
the
all
the
lights
were
removed
save
two
lofty
wax
flambeaux
which
were
placed
to
the
back
and
threw
a
lurid
glare
upon
the
group
immediately
about
the
body
consisting
of
ranulph
rookwood
and
some
other
friends
of
the
deceased
small
stood
in
front
of
the
bier
and
under
the
directions
of
peter
bradley
the
tenantry
and
household
were
formed
into
a
wide
across
the
chamber
there
was
a
hush
of
expectation
as
small
looked
gravely
round
and
even
jack
palmer
who
was
as
little
likely
as
any
man
to
yield
to
an
impression
of
the
kind
felt
himself
moved
by
the
scene
the
very
orthodox
small
as
is
well
known
to
our
readers
held
everything
savoring
of
the
superstitions
of
the
scarlet
woman
in
supreme
abomination
and
entertaining
such
opinions
it
can
scarcely
be
supposed
that
a
funeral
oration
would
find
much
favor
in
his
eyes
accompanied
as
it
was
with
the
accessories
of
censer
candle
and
cup
all
evidently
derived
from
that
period
when
under
the
pontiff
sway
the
shaven
priest
pronounced
his
benediction
the
dead
and
released
the
penitent
soul
from
purgatorial
flames
while
he
heavily
mulcted
the
price
of
his
redemption
from
the
possessions
of
his
successor
small
resented
the
idea
of
treading
in
such
steps
as
an
insult
to
himself
and
his
cloth
was
he
the
intolerant
of
papistry
to
tolerate
this
was
he
who
could
not
endure
the
odor
of
catholicism
to
have
his
nostrils
thus
polluted
his
garments
thus
defiled
by
actual
contact
with
it
it
was
not
to
be
thought
of
and
he
had
formally
signified
his
declination
to
coates
when
a
little
conversation
with
that
gentleman
and
certain
weighty
considerations
therein
held
forth
the
advowson
of
the
church
of
rookwood
residing
with
the
family
and
represented
by
him
as
well
as
the
placing
in
juxtaposition
of
penalties
to
be
incurred
by
refusal
that
the
scruples
of
small
gave
way
and
with
the
best
grace
he
could
muster
very
reluctantly
promised
compliance
with
these
feelings
it
will
be
readily
conceived
that
the
doctor
was
not
in
the
best
possible
frame
of
mind
for
the
delivery
of
his
exhortation
his
spirit
had
been
ruffled
by
a
variety
of
petty
annoyances
amongst
the
greatest
of
which
was
the
condition
to
which
the
good
cheer
had
reduced
his
clerk
zachariah
trundletext
whose
reeling
eye
pendulous
position
and
open
mouth
proclaimed
him
absolutely
incapable
of
office
zachariah
was
in
consequence
dismissed
and
small
commenced
his
discourse
unsupported
but
as
our
recording
it
would
not
probably
conduce
to
the
amusement
of
our
readers
whatever
it
might
to
their
edification
we
shall
pass
it
over
with
very
brief
mention
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
oration
was
so
thickly
interstrewn
with
lengthy
quotations
from
the
fathers
chrysostomus
hieronymus
ambrosius
basilius
bernardus
and
the
rest
with
whose
recondite
latinity
notwithstanding
the
clashing
of
their
opinions
with
his
own
the
doctor
was
intimately
acquainted
and
which
he
moreover
delighted
to
quote
that
his
auditors
were
absolutely
mystified
and
perplexed
and
probably
not
without
design
countenances
of
such
amazement
were
turned
towards
him
that
small
who
had
a
keen
sense
of
the
ludicrous
could
scarcely
forbear
smiling
as
he
proceeded
and
if
we
could
suspect
so
grave
a
personage
of
waggery
we
should
almost
think
that
by
way
of
retaliation
he
had
palmed
some
abstruse
monkish
epicedium
upon
his
astounded
auditors
the
oration
concluded
biscuits
and
confectionery
were
according
to
old
observance
handed
to
such
of
the
tenantry
as
chose
to
partake
of
them
the
serving
of
the
which
ought
to
have
formed
part
of
the
duties
of
zachariah
had
he
been
capable
of
office
fell
to
the
share
of
the
sexton
the
bowl
was
kissed
first
by
ranulph
with
lips
that
trembled
with
emotion
and
afterward
by
his
surrounding
friends
but
no
drop
was
tasted
a
circumstance
which
did
not
escape
observation
proceeding
to
the
tenantry
the
first
in
order
happened
to
be
farmer
toft
peter
presented
the
cup
and
as
toft
was
about
to
drain
a
deep
draught
of
the
wine
peter
whispered
in
his
ear
take
my
advice
for
once
friend
toft
and
do
let
a
bubble
of
the
liquid
pass
your
lips
for
every
drop
of
the
wine
you
drain
sir
piers
will
have
one
sin
the
less
and
you
a
load
the
heavier
on
your
conscience
didst
never
hear
of
for
what
else
was
this
custom
adopted
seest
thou
not
the
cup
brim
hath
not
yet
been
moistened
well
as
you
will
ha
ha
and
the
sexton
passed
onwards
his
work
being
nearly
completed
he
looked
around
for
jack
palmer
whom
he
had
remarked
during
the
oration
but
could
nowhere
discover
him
peter
was
about
to
place
the
flagon
now
almost
drained
of
its
contents
upon
its
former
when
small
took
it
from
his
hands
poculi
fundo
residuum

said
he
returning
the
empty
cup
to
the
sexton
my
task
here
is
ended
muttered
peter
but
not
elsewhere
foul

must
to
the

his
final
instructions
to
certain
of
the
household
who
were
to
form
part
of
the
procession
in
case
it
set
out
he
opened
the
hall
door
and
the
pelting
shower
dashing
heavily
in
his
face
took
his
way
up
the
avenue
screaming
as
he
strode
along
the
following
congenial
rhymes
ephialtes
i
ride

i
ride
by
night
through
the
moonless
air
on
a
courser
white
over
the

and
there
at
my
fantasy
my

withered
my
visage

my
locks
are
frore
and
my
bones

cold
the
wolf
will
howl
as

and
the
stare
for

at

and
the

i

astride
astride
astride

a

antic
shapes
i
take
the
stoutest
heart
at

quake
the

dreams
of
a

a
cask
of

the

recreant

by
his

his

to

nailed
the
goatherd
dreams

and
dizzily
reeling
downward
drops
the
murderer
feels
at
his
throat
a
knife
and
gasps
as
his
victim

astride

i
walked
about
the
mid
of
night
into
a
churchyard
webster
white
lights
streamed
through
the
chancel
window
as
the
sexton
entered
the
churchyard
darkly
defining
all
the
ramified
tracery
of
the
noble
gothic
arch
and
illumining
the
gorgeous
dyes
of
its
glass
profusely
decorated
with
the
armorial
bearings
of
the
founder
of
the
fane
and
the
many
alliances
of
his
descendants
the
sheen
of
their
blazonry
gleamed
bright
in
the
darkness
as
if
to
herald
to
his
last
home
another
of
the
line
whose
achievements
it
displayed
glowing
colorings
checkered
like
rainbow
tints
were
shed
upon
the
broken
leaves
of
the
adjoining
and
upon
the
rounded
grassy
tombs
opening
the
gate
as
he
looked
in
that
direction
peter
became
aware
of
a
dark
figure
enveloped
in
a
large
black
cloak
and
covered
with
a
slouched
hat
standing
at
some
distance
between
the
window
and
the
tree
and
so
intervening
as
to
receive
the
full
influence
of
the
stream
of
radiance
which
served
to
dilate
its
almost
superhuman
stature
the
sexton
stopped
the
figure
remained
stationary
there
was
something
singular
both
in
the
costume
and
situation
of
the
person
curiosity
was
speedily
aroused
and
familiar
with
every
inch
of
the
churchyard
he
determined
to
take
the
nearest
cut
and
to
ascertain
to
whom
the
mysterious
cloak
and
hat
belonged
making
his
way
over
the
undulating
graves
and
instinctively
rounding
the
headstones
that
intercepted
his
path
he
quickly
drew
near
the
object
of
his
inquiry
from
the
moveless
posture
it
maintained
the
figure
appeared
to
be
unconscious
of
peter
approach
to
his
eyes
it
seemed
to
expand
as
he
advanced
he
was
now
almost
close
upon
it
when
his
progress
was
arrested
by
a
violent
grasp
laid
on
his
shoulder
he
started
and
uttered
an
exclamation
of
alarm
at
this
moment
a
vivid
flash
of
lightning
illumined
the
whole
churchyard
and
peter
then
thought
he
beheld
at
some
distance
from
him
two
other
figures
bearing
upon
their
shoulders
a
huge
chest
or
it
might
be
a
coffin
the
garb
of
these
figures
so
far
as
it
could
be
discerned
through
the
drenching
rain
was
fantastical
in
the
extreme
the
foremost
seemed
to
have
a
long
white
beard
descending
to
his
girdle
little
leisure
however
was
allowed
peter
for
observation
the
vision
no
sooner
met
his
glance
than
it
disappeared
and
nothing
was
seen
but
the
glimmering
tombstones
nothing
heard
but
the
whistling
wind
and
the
shower
he
rubbed
his
eyes
the
muffled
figure
had
vanished
and
not
a
trace
could
be
discovered
of
the
mysterious
if
such
they
were
what
have
i
seen
mentally
ejaculated
peter
is
this
sorcery
or
treachery
or
both
no
would
visit
this
place
on
a
night
like
this
when
the
whole
neighborhood
is
aroused
can
it
be
a
vision
i
have
seen
pshaw
shall
i
juggle
myself
as
i
deceive
these
hinds
it
was
no
bearded
demon
that
i
beheld
but
the
gipsy
patrico
balthazar
i
knew
him
at
once
but
what
meant
that
muffled
figure
and
whose
arm
could
it
have
been
that
griped
my
shoulder
ha
what
if
lady
rookwood
should
have
given
orders
for
the
removal
of
susan
body
no
no
that
can
not
be
besides
i
have
the
keys
of
the
vault
and
there
are
hundreds
now
in
the
church
who
would
permit
no
such
desecration
i
am
perplexed
to
think
what
it
can
mean
but
i
will
to
the
vault
saying
which
he
hastened
to
the
church
porch
and
after
wringing
the
wet
from
his
clothes
as
a
might
shake
the
moisture
from
his
curly
hide
and
doffing
his
broad
felt
hat
he
entered
the
holy
edifice
the
interior
seemed
one
blaze
of
light
to
the
sexton
in
his
sudden
transition
from
outer
darkness
some
few
persons
were
assembled
probably
such
as
were
engaged
in
the
preparations
but
there
was
one
group
which
immediately
caught
his
attention
near
the
stood
three
persons
habited
in
deep
mourning
apparently
occupied
in
examining
the
various
monumental
carvings
that
enriched
the
walls
peter
office
led
him
to
that
part
of
the
church
about
to
descend
into
the
vaults
to
make
the
last
preparations
for
the
reception
of
the
dead
with
lantern
in
hand
keys
and
a
crowbar
he
approached
the
party
little
attention
was
paid
to
the
proceedings
till
the
harsh
grating
of
the
lock
attracted
their
notice
peter
started
as
he
beheld
the
face
of
one
of
the
three
and
relaxing
his
hold
upon
the
key
the
strong
bolt
shot
back
in
the
lock
there
was
a
whisper
amongst
the
party
a
light
step
was
heard
advancing
towards
him
and
ere
the
sexton
could
sufficiently
recover
his
surprise
or
force
open
the
door
a
female
figure
stood
by
his
side
the
keen
inquiring
stare
which
peter
bestowed
upon
the
countenance
of
the
young
lady
so
much
abashed
her
that
she
hesitated
in
her
purpose
of
addressing
him
and
hastily
retired
she
here
muttered
peter
nay
then
i
must
no
longer
withhold
the
dreaded
secret
from
luke
or
ranulph
may
indeed
wrest
his
possessions
from
him
reinforced
by
her
companions
an
elderly
lady
and
a
tall
handsome
man
whose
bearing
and
deportment
bespoke
him
to
be
a
soldier
the
fair
stranger
again
ventured
towards
peter
you
are
the
sexton
said
she
addressing
him
in
a
voice
sweet
and
musical
i
am
returned
peter
it
was
harmony
succeeded
by
dissonance
you
perhaps
can
tell
us
then
said
the
elderly
lady
whether
the
funeral
is
likely
to
take
place
we
thought
it
possible
that
the
storm
might
altogether
prevent
it
the
storm
is
over
as
nearly
as
maybe
replied
peter
the
body
will
soon
be
on
its
way
i
am
but
now
arrived
from
the
hall
indeed
exclaimed
the
lady
none
of
the
family
will
be
present
i
suppose
who
is
the
chief
mourner
young
sir
ranulph
answered
the
sexton
there
will
be
more
of
the
family
than
were
expected
is
sir
ranulph
returned
asked
the
young
lady
with
great
agitation
of
manner
i
thought
he
was
abroad
that
he
was
not
expected
are
you
sure
you
are
rightly
informed
i
parted
with
him
at
the
hall
not
ten
minutes
since
replied
peter
he
returned
from
france
most
unexpectedly
oh
mother
exclaimed
the
younger
lady
that
this
should
be
that
i
should
meet
him
here
why
did
we
come
let
us
depart
impossible
replied
her
mother
the
storm
forbids
it
this
information
is
so
strange
i
scarce
can
credit
it
are
you
sure
you
have
asserted
the
truth
said
she
addressing
peter
i
am
not
accustomed
to
be
doubted
answered
he
other
things
as
strange
have
happened
at
the
hall
what
mean
you
asked
the
gentleman
noticing
this
last
remark
you
would
not
need
to
ask
the
question
of
me
had
you
been
there
amongst
the
other
guests
retorted
peter
odd
things
i
tell
you
have
been
done
there
this
night
and
stranger
things
may
occur
before
the
morning
you
are
insolent
sirrah
i
comprehend
you
not
enough
i
can
comprehend
replied
peter
significantly
i
know
the
count
of
the
mourners
invited
to
this
ceremonial
and
i
am
aware
that
there
are
three
too
many
know
you
this
saucy
knave
mother
i
can
not
call
him
to
mind
though
i
fancy
i
have
seen
him
before
my
recollection
serves
me
better
lady
interposed
peter
i
remember
one
who
was
once
the
proud
heiress
of
rookwood
ay
proud
and
beautiful
then
the
house
was
filled
with
her
gallant
suitors
swords
were
crossed
for
her
hearts
bled
for
her
yet
she
favored
none
until
one
hapless
hour
sir
reginald
rookwood
a
daughter
sir
reginald
a
daughter
ha
i
see
i
am
right
well
he
is
dead
and
buried
and
reginald
his
son
is
dead
likewise
and
piers
is
on
his
road
hither
and
you
are
the
last
as
in
the
course
of
nature
you
might
have
been
the
first
and
now
that
they
are
all
gone
you
do
rightly
to
bury
your
grievances
with
them
silence
sirrah
exclaimed
the
gentleman
or
i
will
beat
your
brains
out
with
your
own
spade
no
let
him
speak
vavasour
said
the
lady
with
an
expression
of
anguish
he
has
awakened
thoughts
of
other
days
i
have
done
said
peter
and
must
to
work
will
you
descend
with
me
madam
into
the
sepulchre
of
your
ancestry
all
your
family
lie
within
ay
and
the
lady
eleanor
your
mother
amongst
the
number
mowbray
signified
her
assent
and
the
party
prepared
to
follow
him
the
sexton
held
the
lantern
so
as
to
throw
its
light
upon
the
steps
as
they
entered
the
gloomy
receptacle
of
the
departed
eleanor
half
repented
having
ventured
within
its
dreary
limits
so
much
did
the
appearance
of
the
yawning
catacombs
surcharged
with
mortality
and
above
all
the
ghostly
figure
of
the
grim
knight
affect
her
with
dread
as
she
looked
wistfully
around
she
required
all
the
support
her
brother
arm
could
afford
her
nor
was
mowbray
altogether
unmoved
and
all
the
family
are
here
interred
you
say
inquired
the
latter
all
replied
the
sexton
where
then
lies
sir
reginald
younger
brother
who
exclaimed
peter
starting
alan
rookwood
what
of
him
nothing
of
moment
but
i
thought
you
could
perhaps
inform
me
he
died
young
he
did
replied
peter
in
an
altered
tone
very
young
but
not
before
he
had
lived
to
an
old
age
of
wretchedness
do
you
know
his
story
madam
i
have
heard
it
from
your
father
lips
from
sir
reginald
rookwood
never
call
him
not
my
father
sirrah
even
i
will
not
have
him
named
so
to
me
your
pardon
madam
returned
the
sexton
great
cruelty
was
shown
to
the
lady
eleanor
and
may
well
call
forth
implacable
resentment
in
her
child
yet
methinks
the
wrong
he
did
his
brother
alan
was
the
foulest
stain
with
which
sir
reginald
black
soul
was
dyed
with
what
particular
wrong
dost
thou
charge
sir
reginald
demanded
major
mowbray
what
injury
did
he
inflict
upon
his
brother
alan
he
wronged
his
brother
honor
replied
the
sexton
he
robbed
him
of
his
wife
poisoned
his
existence
and
hurried
him
to
an
untimely
grave
eleanor
shudderingly
held
back
during
this
horrible
narration
the
hearing
of
which
she
would
willingly
have
shunned
had
it
been
possible
can
this
be
true
asked
the
major
too
true
my
son
replied
mowbray
sorrowfully
and
where
lies
the
unfortunate
alan
asked
major
mowbray
two
cross
roads
where
else
should
the
suicide
lie
evading
any
further
question
peter
hastily
traversed
the
vault
elevating
the
light
so
as
to
reveal
the
contents
of
each
cell
one
circumstance
filled
him
with
surprise
and
dismay
he
could
nowhere
perceive
the
coffin
of
his
daughter
in
vain
he
peered
into
every
catacomb
they
were
apparently
undisturbed
and
with
much
internal
marvelling
and
misgiving
peter
gave
up
the
search
that
vision
is
now
explained
muttered
he
the
body
is
removed
but
by
whom
death
can
i
doubt
it
must
be
lady
rookwood
who
else
can
have
any
interest
in
its
removal
she
has
acted
boldly
but
she
shall
yet
have
reason
to
repent
her
temerity
as
he
continued
his
search
his
companions
silently
followed
suddenly
he
stopped
and
signifying
that
all
was
finished
they
not
unwillingly
quitted
this
abode
of
horror
leaving
him
behind
them
it
is
a
dreadful
place
whispered
eleanor
to
her
mother
nor
would
i
have
visited
it
had
i
conceived
anything
of
its
horrors
and
that
strange
man
who
or
what
is
he
ay
who
is
he
repeated
major
mowbray
i
recollect
him
now
replied
mowbray
he
is
one
who
has
ever
been
connected
with
the
family
he
had
a
daughter
whose
beauty
was
her
ruin
it
is
a
sad
tale
i
can
not
tell
it
now
you
have
heard
enough
of
misery
and
guilt
but
that
may
account
for
his
bitterness
of
speech
he
was
a
dependent
upon
my
poor
brother
poor
man
replied
eleanor
if
he
has
been
unfortunate
i
pity
him
i
am
sorry
we
have
been
into
that
dreadful
place
i
am
very
faint
and
i
tremble
more
than
ever
at
the
thought
of
meeting
ranulph
rookwood
again
i
can
scarcely
support
myself
i
am
sure
i
shall
not
venture
to
look
upon
him
had
i
dreamed
of
the
likelihood
of
his
attending
the
ceremony
rest
assured
dear
eleanor
we
should
not
have
been
here
but
i
was
informed
there
was
no
possibility
of
his
return
compose
yourself
my
child
it
will
be
a
trying
time
to
both
of
us
but
it
is
now
inevitable
at
this
moment
the
bell
began
to
toll
the
procession
has
started
said
peter
as
he
passed
the
mowbrays
that
bell
announces
the
setting
out
see
yonder
persons
hurrying
to
the
door
exclaimed
eleanor
with
eagerness
and
trembling
violently
they
are
coming
oh
i
shall
never
be
able
to
go
through
with
it
dear
mother
peter
hastened
to
the
church
door
where
he
stationed
himself
in
company
with
a
host
of
others
equally
curious
flickering
lights
in
the
distance
shining
like
stars
through
the
trees
showed
them
that
the
procession
was
collecting
in
front
of
the
hall
the
rain
had
now
entirely
ceased
the
thunder
muttered
from
afar
and
the
lightning
seemed
only
to
lick
the
moisture
from
the
trees
the
bell
continued
to
toll
and
its
loud
booming
awoke
the
drowsy
echoes
of
the
valley
on
the
sudden
a
solitary
startling
concussion
of
thunder
was
heard
and
presently
a
man
rushed
down
from
the
belfry
with
the
tidings
that
he
had
seen
a
ball
of
fire
fall
from
a
cloud
right
over
the
hall
every
ear
was
on
the
alert
for
the
next
sound
none
was
heard
it
was
the
crisis
of
the
storm
still
the
funeral
procession
advanced
not
the
strong
sheen
of
the
torchlight
was
still
visible
from
the
bottom
of
the
avenue
now
disappearing
now
brightly
glimmering
as
if
the
bearers
were
hurrying
to
and
fro
amongst
the
trees
it
was
evident
that
much
confusion
prevailed
and
that
some
misadventure
had
occurred
each
man
muttered
to
his
neighbor
and
few
were
there
who
had
not
in
a
measure
surmised
the
cause
of
the
delay
at
this
juncture
a
person
without
his
hat
breathless
with
haste
and
almost
palsied
with
fright
rushed
through
the
midst
of
them
and
stumbling
over
the
threshold
fell
headlong
into
the
church
what
the
matter
master
plant
what
has
happened
tell
us
tell
us
exclaimed
several
voices
simultaneously
lord
have
mercy
upon
us
cried
plant
gasping
for
utterance
and
not
attempting
to
raise
himself
it
horrible
dreadful
oh
oh
what
has
happened
inquired
peter
approaching
the
fallen
man
and
dost
need
to
ask
peter
bradley
thou
who
foretold
it
all
but
i
will
not
say
what
i
think
though
my
tongue
itches
to
tell
thee
the
truth
be
satisfied
thy
wizard
lore
has
served
thee
right
he
is
dead
who
ranulph
rookwood
has
anything
befallen
him
or
the
prisoner
luke
bradley
asked
the
sexton
with
eagerness
a
scream
here
burst
forth
from
one
who
was
standing
behind
the
group
and
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
her
mother
to
withhold
her
eleanor
mowbray
rushed
forward
has
aught
happened
to
sir
ranulph
asked
she
noa
noa
not
to
sir
ranulph
he
be
with
the
body
heaven
be
thanked
for
that
exclaimed
eleanor
and
then
as
if
ashamed
of
her
own
vehemence
and
it
might
seem
apparent
indifference
to
another
fate
she
inquired
who
was
hurt
it
be
poor
neighbor
toft
that
be
killed
by
a
thunderbolt
replied
plant
exclamations
of
horror
burst
from
all
around
no
one
was
more
surprised
at
this
intelligence
than
the
sexton
like
many
other
seers
he
had
not
in
all
probability
calculated
upon
the
fulfilment
of
his
predictions
and
he
now
stared
aghast
at
the
extent
of
his
own
foreknowledge
i
tell
what
master
peter
said
plant
shaking
his
it
be
well
for
thee
thou
did
live
in
my
grandfather
time
or
ha
been
ducked
in
a
blanket
or
may
be
burnt
at
the
stake
like
ridley
and
latimer
as
we
read
on
but
however
that
may
be
ye
shall
hear
how
poor
toft
death
came
to
pass
and
nobody
can
tell
better
nor
i
seeing
i
were
near
to
him
poor
fellow
at
the
time
well
we
thought
as
how
the
storm
were
all
over
and
had
all
got
into
order
of
march
and
were
just
beginning
to
step
up
the
avenue
the
pushing
lustily
along
and
the
torches
shining
grandly
when
poor
simon
toft
who
could
never
travel
well
in
liquor
in
his
life
reeled
to
one
side
and
staggering
against
the
first
huge
sat
himself
down
beneath
it
thou
knowest
the
tree
i
mean
the
tree
of
fate
returned
peter
i
ought
methinks
to
know
it
well
i
were
just
stepping
aside
to
pick
him
up
when
all
at
once
there
comes
such
a
crack
of
thunder
and
whizzing
through
the
trees
flashed
a
great
globe
of
red
fire
so
bright
and
dazzlin
it
nearly
blinded
me
and
when
i
opened
my
eyes
winkin
and
waterin
i
see
that
which
blinded
me
more
even
than
the
flash
that
which
had
just
afore
been
poor
simon
but
which
was
now
a
mass
o
black
smouldering
ashes
clean
consumed
and
destroyed
his
clothes
rent
to
a
thousand
tatters
the
earth
and
stones
tossed
up
and
scattered
all
about
and
a
great
splinter
of
the
tree
lying
beside
him
heaven
will
be
done
said
the
sexton
this
is
an
awful
judgment
and
sathan
cast
down
for
this
is
a
spice
o
his
handiwork
muttered
plant
adding
as
he
slunk
away
if
ever
peter
bradley
do
come
to
the
blanket
dang
me
if
i
do
lend
a
helpin
hand
how
like
a
silent
stream
shaded
by
night
and
gliding
softly
with
our
windy
sighs
moves
the
whole
frame
of
this
solemnity
tears
sighs
and
blacks
filling
the
simile
whilst
i
the
only
murmur
in
this
grove
of
death
thus
hollowly
break
forth
fatal
word
being
given
that
the
funeral
train
was
fast
approaching
the
church
door
was
thrown
open
and
the
assemblage
divided
in
two
lines
to
allow
it
admission
meanwhile
a
striking
change
had
taken
place
even
in
this
brief
period
in
the
appearance
of
the
night
the
sky
heretofore
curtained
with
darkness
was
now
illumined
by
a
serene
soft
moon
which
floating
in
a
watery
halo
tinged
with
silvery
radiance
the
edges
of
a
few
ghostly
clouds
that
hurried
along
the
deep
and
starlit
skies
the
suddenness
of
the
change
could
not
fail
to
excite
surprise
and
admiration
mingled
with
regret
that
the
procession
had
not
been
delayed
until
the
present
time
slowly
and
mournfully
the
train
was
seen
to
approach
the
churchyard
winding
two
by
two
with
melancholy
step
around
the
corner
of
the
road
first
came
small
then
the
mutes
with
their
sable
panoply
next
the
next
those
who
sustained
the
coffin
bending
beneath
their
ponderous
burden
followed
by
sir
ranulph
and
a
long
line
of
attendants
all
plainly
to
be
distinguished
by
the
flashing
torchlight
there
was
a
slight
halt
at
the
gate
and
the
coffin
changed
supporters
ill
luck
betide
them
ejaculated
peter
could
they
find
no
other
place
except
that
to
halt
at
must
sir
piers
be
gatekeeper
till
next
yule
no
added
he
seeing
what
followed
it
will
be
poor
toft
after
all
following
close
upon
the
coffin
came
a
rude
shell
containing
as
peter
rightly
conjectured
the
miserable
remains
of
simon
toft
who
had
met
his
fate
in
the
manner
described
by
plant
the
bolt
of
death
glanced
from
the
tree
which
it
first
struck
and
reduced
the
unfortunate
farmer
to
a
heap
of
dust
universal
consternation
prevailed
and
doubts
were
entertained
as
to
what
course
should
be
pursued
it
was
judged
best
by
small
to
remove
the
remains
at
once
to
the
thus
unanointed
unaneled
with
all
his
imperfections
on
his
head
was
poor
simon
toft
in
one
brief
second
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
plunged
from
the
height
of
festivity
to
the
darkness
of
the
grave
and
so
horribly
disfigured
that
scarce
a
vestige
of
humanity
was
discernible
in
the
mutilated
mass
that
remained
of
him
truly
may
we
be
said
to
walk
in
blindness
and
amidst
deep
pitfalls
the
churchyard
was
thronged
by
the
mournful
train
the
long
array
of
dusky
figures
the
waving
torchlight
gleaming
ruddily
in
the
white
moonshine
now
glistening
upon
the
sombre
habiliments
of
the
bearers
and
on
their
shrouded
load
now
reflected
upon
the
jagged
branches
of
the
or
falling
upon
the
ivied
buttresses
of
the
ancient
church
constituted
no
unimpressive
picture
over
all
like
a
lamp
hung
in
the
still
sky
shone
the
moon
shedding
a
soothing
spiritual
lustre
over
the
scene
the
organ
broke
into
a
solemn
strain
as
the
coffin
was
borne
along
the
the
mourners
following
with
reverent
step
and
slow
it
was
deposited
near
the
mouth
of
the
vault
the
whole
assemblage
circling
around
it
small
proceeded
with
the
performance
of
that
magnificent
service
appointed
for
the
burial
of
the
dead
in
a
tone
as
remarkable
for
its
sadness
as
for
its
force
and
fervor
there
was
a
tear
in
every
eye
a
cloud
on
every
brow
brightly
illumined
as
was
the
whole
building
there
were
still
some
recesses
which
owing
to
the
intervention
of
heavy
pillars
were
thrown
into
shade
and
in
one
of
these
supported
by
her
mother
and
brother
stood
eleanor
a
weeping
witness
of
the
scene
she
beheld
the
coffin
silently
borne
along
she
saw
one
dark
figure
slowly
following
she
knew
those
pale
features
oh
how
pale
they
were
a
year
had
wrought
a
fearful
alteration
she
could
scarce
credit
what
she
beheld
he
must
indeed
have
suffered
deeply
suffered
and
her
heart
told
her
that
his
sorrows
had
been
for
her
many
a
wistful
look
besides
was
directed
to
the
principal
figure
in
this
ceremonial
ranulph
rookwood
he
was
a
prey
to
unutterable
anguish
of
soul
his
heart
bled
inwardly
for
the
father
he
had
lost
mechanically
following
the
body
down
the
aisle
he
had
taken
his
station
near
it
gazing
with
confused
vision
upon
the
bystanders
had
listened
with
a
sad
composure
to
the
expressive
delivery
of
small
until
he
read
man
walketh
in
a
vain
shadow
and
disquieteth
himself
in
vain
he
heapeth
up
riches
and
can
not
tell
who
shall
gather
verily
exclaimed
a
deep
voice
and
ranulph
looking
round
met
the
eyes
of
peter
bradley
fixed
full
upon
him
but
it
was
evidently
not
the
sexton
who
had
spoken
small
continued
the
service
he
arrived
at
this
verse
hast
set
our
misdeeds
before
thee
and
our
secret
sins
in
the
light
of
thy
even
so
exclaimed
the
voice
and
as
ranulph
raised
his
eyes
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
he
thought
he
saw
a
dark
figure
muffled
in
a
cloak
disappear
behind
one
of
the
pillars
he
bestowed
however
at
the
moment
little
thought
upon
this
incident
his
heart
melted
within
him
and
leaning
his
face
upon
his
hand
he
wept
aloud
command
yourself
i
entreat
of
you
my
dear
sir
ranulph
said
small
as
soon
as
the
service
was
finished
and
suffer
this
melancholy
ceremonial
to
be
completed
saying
which
he
gently
withdrew
ranulph
from
his
support
and
the
coffin
was
lowered
into
the
vault
ranulph
remained
for
some
time
in
the
extremity
of
sorrow
when
he
in
part
recovered
the
crowd
had
dispersed
and
few
persons
were
remaining
within
the
church
yet
near
him
stood
three
apparent
loiterers
they
advanced
towards
him
an
exclamation
of
surprise
and
joy
burst
from
his
lips
eleanor
ranulph
is
it
possible
do
i
indeed
behold
you
eleanor
no
other
word
was
spoken
they
rushed
into
each
other
arms
oh
sad
sad
is
the
lover
parting
no
pang
so
keen
but
if
life
hath
a
zest
more
exquisite
than
others
if
felicity
hath
one
drop
more
racy
than
the
rest
in
her
honeyed
cup
it
is
the
happiness
enjoyed
in
such
a
union
as
the
present
to
say
that
he
was
as
one
raised
from
the
depths
of
misery
by
some
angel
comforter
were
a
feeble
comparison
of
the
transport
of
ranulph
to
paint
the
thrilling
delight
of
eleanor
the
trembling
tenderness
the
fond
abandonment
which
vanquished
all
her
maiden
scruples
would
be
impossible
reluctantly
yielding
fearing
yet
complying
her
lips
were
sealed
in
one
long
loving
kiss
the
sanctifying
pledge
of
their
tried
affection
eleanor
dear
eleanor
exclaimed
ranulph
though
i
hold
you
within
my
arms
though
each
nerve
within
my
frame
assures
me
of
your
presence
though
i
look
into
those
eyes
which
seem
fraught
with
greater
endearment
than
ever
i
have
known
them
wear
though
i
see
and
feel
and
know
all
this
so
sudden
so
unlooked
for
is
the
happiness
that
i
could
almost
doubt
its
reality
say
to
what
blessed
circumstance
i
am
indebted
for
this
happiness
we
are
staying
not
far
hence
with
friends
dear
ranulph
and
my
mother
hearing
of
sir
piers
rookwood
death
and
wishing
to
bury
all
animosity
with
him
resolved
to
be
present
at
the
sad
ceremony
we
were
told
you
could
not
be
here
and
would
my
presence
have
prevented
your
attendance
eleanor
not
that
dear
ranulph
but
but
what
at
this
moment
the
advance
of
mowbray
offered
an
interruption
to
their
further
discourse
my
son
and
i
appear
to
be
secondary
in
your
regards
sir
ranulph
said
she
gravely
ranulph
mentally
echoed
the
young
man
what
will
think
when
she
knows
that
that
title
is
not
mine
i
dread
to
tell
her
he
then
added
aloud
with
a
melancholy
smile
i
crave
your
pardon
madam
the
delight
of
a
meeting
so
unexpected
with
your
daughter
must
plead
my
apology
none
is
wanting
sir
ranulph
said
major
mowbray
i
who
have
known
what
separation
from
my
sister
is
can
readily
excuse
your
feelings
but
you
look
i
have
indeed
experienced
much
mental
anxiety
said
ranulph
looking
at
eleanor
it
is
now
past
and
i
would
fain
hope
that
a
brighter
day
is
dawning
his
heart
answered
was
but
a
hope
you
were
unlooked
for
here
sir
ranulph
said
mowbray
by
us
at
least
we
were
told
you
were
abroad
you
were
rightly
informed
madam
replied
ranulph
i
only
arrived
this
evening
from
bordeaux
i
am
glad
you
are
returned
we
are
at
present
on
a
visit
with
your
neighbors
the
davenhams
at
braybrook
and
trust
we
shall
see
you
there
i
will
ride
over
replied
ranulph
there
is
much
on
which
i
would
consult
you
all
i
would
have
ventured
to
request
the
favor
of
your
company
at
rookwood
had
the
occasion
been
other
than
the
present
and
i
would
willingly
have
accepted
your
invitation
returned
mowbray
i
should
like
to
see
the
old
house
once
more
during
your
father
lifetime
i
could
not
approach
it
you
are
lord
of
broad
lands
sir
ranulph
a
goodly
inheritance
madam
and
a
proud
title
which
you
will
grace
well
i
doubt
not
the
first
the
noblest
of
our
house
was
he
from
whom
you
derive
your
name
you
are
the
third
sir
ranulph
the
first
founded
the
house
of
rookwood
the
next
advanced
it
is
for
you
to
raise
its
glory
to
its
height
alas
madam
i
have
no
such
thought
wherefore
not
you
are
young
wealthy
powerful
with
such
domains
as
those
of
rookwood
with
such
a
title
as
its
lord
can
claim
naught
should
be
too
high
for
your
aspirations
i
aspire
to
nothing
madam
but
your
daughter
hand
and
even
that
i
will
not
venture
to
solicit
until
you
are
acquainted
with
and
he
hesitated
with
what
asked
mowbray
in
surprise
a
singular
and
to
me
most
perplexing
event
has
occurred
replied
ranulph
which
may
materially
affect
my
future
fortunes
indeed
exclaimed
mowbray
does
it
relate
to
your
mother
excuse
my
answering
the
question
now
madam
replied
ranulph
you
shall
know
all
ay
dear
ranulph
said
eleanor
and
whatever
that
morrow
may
bring
forth
it
will
bring
happiness
to
me
if
you
are
bearer
of
the
tidings
i
shall
expect
your
coming
with
impatience
said
mowbray
and
i
added
major
mowbray
who
had
listened
thus
far
in
silence
would
offer
you
my
services
in
any
way
you
think
they
would
be
useful
command
me
as
you
think
fitting
i
thank
you
heartily
returned
ranulph
you
shall
learn
all
meanwhile
it
shall
be
my
business
to
investigate
the
truth
or
falsehood
of
the
statement
i
have
heard
ere
i
report
it
to
you
till
then
farewell
as
they
issued
from
the
church
it
was
gray
dawn
mowbray
carriage
stood
at
the
door
the
party
entered
it
and
accompanied
by
small
whom
he
found
within
in
the
vestry
ranulph
walked
towards
the
hall
where
a
fresh
surprise
awaited
him
which
is
the
place
where
we
to
be
concealed
this
inner
room
is
well
the
word
is
now
i
take
you
of
guarded
by
the
two
young
farmers
who
had
displayed
so
much
address
in
seizing
him
luke
meanwhile
had
been
conveyed
in
safety
to
the
small
chamber
in
the
eastern
wing
destined
by
coates
to
be
his
place
of
confinement
for
the
night
the
room
or
rather
closet
opening
from
another
room
was
extremely
well
adapted
for
the
purpose
having
no
perceptible
outlet
being
defended
on
either
side
by
thick
partition
walls
of
the
hardest
oak
and
at
the
extremity
by
the
solid
masonry
of
the
mansion
it
was
in
fact
a
remnant
of
the
building
anterior
to
the
first
sir
ranulph
day
and
the
narrow
limits
of
luke
cell
had
been
erected
long
before
the
date
of
his
earliest
progenitor
having
seen
their
prisoner
safely
bestowed
the
room
was
carefully
examined
every
board
sounded
every
crevice
and
corner
peered
into
by
the
curious
eye
of
the
little
lawyer
and
nothing
being
found
insecure
the
light
was
removed
the
door
locked
the
rustic
constables
dismissed
and
a
brace
of
pistols
having
been
loaded
and
laid
on
the
table
coates
pronounced
himself
thoroughly
satisfied
and
quite
comfortable
comfortable
titus
heaved
a
sigh
as
he
echoed
the
word
he
felt
anything
but
comfortable
his
heart
was
with
the
body
all
the
while
he
thought
of
the
splendor
of
the
funeral
the
torches
the
illumined
church
his
own
dignified
march
down
the
aisle
and
the
effect
he
expected
to
produce
amongst
the
bewildered
rustics
he
thought
of
all
these
things
and
cursed
luke
by
all
the
saints
in
the
calendar
the
sight
of
the
musty
old
apartment
hung
round
with
faded
arras
which
as
he
said
smelt
of
nothing
but
rats
and
ghosts
and
suchlike
varmint
did
not
serve
to
inspirit
him
and
the
proper
equilibrium
of
his
temper
was
not
completely
restored
until
the
appearance
of
the
butler
with
all
the
requisites
for
the
manufacture
of
punch
afforded
him
some
prospective
solace
and
what
are
they
about
now
tim
asked
titus
all
as
jolly
as
can
be
answered
the
domestic
small
is
just
about
to
pronounce
the
funeral
devil
take
it
ejaculated
titus
there
another
miss
could
i
just
slip
out
and
hear
that
on
no
account
said
coates
consider
sir
ranulph
is
there
well
well
rejoined
titus
heaving
a
deep
sigh
and
squeezing
a
lemon
are
you
sure
this
is
water
tim
you
know
i
mighty
particular
perfectly
aware
of
it
sir
ah
tim
do
you
recollect
the
way
i
used
to
brew
for
poor
sir
piers
with
a
bunch
of
red
currants
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
then
to
think
that
after
all
i
should
be
left
out
of
his
funeral
it
the
height
of
barbarity
tim
this
rum
of
yours
is
poor
stuff
there
no
punch
worth
the
trouble
of
drinking
except
a
glass
of
right
potheen
ten
degrees
over
proof
would
be
the
only
thing
to
drown
my
cares
any
such
thing
in
the
cellar
there
used
to
be
an
odd
bottle
or
so
tim
in
the
left
bin
near
the
door
i
a
notion
there
be
returned
timothy
i
try
the
bin
your
honor
mentions
and
if
i
can
lay
hands
upon
a
bottle
you
shall
have
it
you
may
depend
the
butler
departed
and
titus
emulating
coates
who
had
already
enveloped
himself
like
juno
at
the
approach
of
ixion
in
a
cloud
proceeded
to
light
his
pipe
luke
meanwhile
had
been
left
alone
without
light
he
had
much
to
meditate
upon
and
with
naught
to
check
the
current
of
his
thoughts
he
pensively
revolved
his
present
situation
and
future
prospects
the
future
was
gloomy
enough
the
present
fraught
with
danger
and
now
that
the
fever
of
excitement
was
passed
he
severely
reproached
himself
for
his
precipitancy
his
mind
by
degrees
assumed
a
more
tranquil
state
and
exhausted
with
his
great
previous
fatigue
he
threw
himself
upon
the
floor
of
his
and
addressed
himself
to
slumber
the
noise
he
made
induced
coates
to
enter
the
room
which
he
did
with
a
pistol
in
each
hand
followed
by
titus
with
a
pipe
and
candle
but
finding
all
safe
the
sentinels
retired
one
may
see
with
half
an
eye
that
you
not
used
to
a
my
friend
said
titus
as
the
door
was
locked
by
the
powers
he
a
tall
chap
anyhow
why
his
feet
almost
touch
the
door
i
should
say
that
room
was
a
matter
of
six
feet
long
mr
coates
exactly
six
feet
sir
well
that
a
good
guess
hang
that
ugly
rascal
tim
he
never
brought
the
whisky
but
i
be
even
with
him
could
you
just
see
to
the
prisoner
for
ten
minutes
mr
coates
not
ten
seconds
i
shall
report
you
if
you
stir
from
your
post
here
the
door
was
opened
and
tim
entered
with
the
whisky
arrah
by
my
soul
tim
and
here
you
are
at
last
uncork
it
man
and
give
us
a
thimbleful
blob
there
goes
the
stopper
here
a
glass
smacking
his
lips
whist
tim
another
drop
stuff
like
this
will
never
hurt
a
body
coates
try
it
no
i
thought
you
be
a
man
of
more
taste
i
must
limit
you
to
a
certain
quantity
replied
coates
or
you
will
not
be
fit
to

be
pleased
to

lighting
their
torches

grand
sight
and
off

titus

more
than
i

enough
of
this
watch
and

prisoner

back
in
an
hour
i
tell
you
what
tyrconnel
said
coates
coolly
taking
up
the
pistol
from
the
table
i
a
man
of
few
words
but
those
few
are
i
hope
to
the
purpose
and
i
have
you
to
know
if
you
stir
from
that
chair
or
attempt
to
leave
the
room
damme
but
i
send
a
brace
of
bullets
after
you
i
serious
i
assure
you
and
he
cocked
the
pistol
by
way
of
reply
to
this
menace
titus
deliberately
filled
a
stiff
glass
of
that
your
last
glass
said
the
inexorable
coates
to
return
once
more
to
luke
he
slept
uneasily
for
some
short
space
and
was
awakened
by
a
sound
which
reached
his
dreaming
ears
and
connected
itself
with
the
visions
that
slumber
was
weaving
around
him
it
was
some
moments
before
he
could
distinctly
remember
where
he
was
he
would
not
venture
to
sleep
again
though
he
felt
overwhelmed
by
drowsiness
there
was
a
fixed
pain
at
his
heart
as
if
circulation
were
suspended
changing
his
posture
he
raised
himself
upon
one
arm
he
then
became
aware
of
a
scratching
noise
somewhat
similar
to
the
sound
he
had
heard
in
his
dream
and
perceived
a
light
gleaming
through
a
crevice
in
the
oaken
partition
his
attention
was
immediately
arrested
and
placing
his
eye
close
to
the
chink
he
distinctly
saw
a
dark
lantern
burning
and
by
its
light
a
man
filing
some
implement
of
housebreaking
the
light
fell
before
the
hard
features
of
the
man
with
whose
countenance
luke
was
familiar
and
although
only
one
person
came
within
the
scope
of
his
view
luke
could
make
out
from
a
muttered
conversation
that
was
carried
on
that
he
had
a
companion
the
parties
were
near
to
him
and
though
speaking
in
a
low
tone
luke
quick
ear
caught
the
following
what
keeps
jack
palmer
i
wonder
said
he
of
the
file
we
all
ready
for
the
fakement
pops
primed
and
i
tell

what
rob
rust
made
my
as
sharp
as
a
razor
and
damme
if
lady
rookwood
offers
any
resistance
i
spoil
her
talking
in
future
i
promise
you
suppressed
laughter
from
rust
followed
this
speech
that
laugh
made
luke
blood
run
cold
within
his
veins
harkee
dick
wilder
you
a
and
stops
at
nothing
and
curse
me
if
i
think
any
more
of
it
than
yourself
but
jack
as
squeamish
of
bloodshed
as
young
miss
that
cries
at
her
cut
finger
it
the
safer
plan
say
what
you
will
nothing
but
will
stop
a
woman
tongue
i
shall
make
short
work
with
her
ladyship
anyhow
hist
here
jack
comes
a
footstep
crossed
in
the
room
and
presently
afterwards
exclamations
of
surprise
and
smothered
laughter
were
heard
from
the
parties
bravo
jack
famous
that
disguise
would
deceive
the
devil
himself
and
now
my
lads
said
the
newcomer
is
all
right

and
tight
nothing
forgotten

with
your
stamps
and
on
with
your
list
slippers
not
a
word
follow
me
and
for
your
lives
do
move
a
step
but
as
i
direct
you
the
word
must
be
piers
rookwood
we
overhaul
the
swag
here
this
crack
may
make
us
all
for
life
and
if
you
follow
my
directions
implicitly
we
do
the
trick
in
style
this
slum
must
be
our
rendezvous
when
all
over
for
hark
ye
my
lads
i
not
budge
an
inch
till
luke
bradley
be
set
free
he

old
friend
and
i
always

by
old
friends

do
the
same
for
one
of
you
if
you
were
in
the
same
scrape
so
damn
you
no
flinching
besides
i
owe
that
snivelling
coates
who
stands
sentry
a
grudge
and
i
pay
him
off
as
paul
did
the
ephesians
you
may
crop
his
ears
or
slit
his
tongue
as
you
would
a
magpie
or
any
other
chattering
varmint
make
him
sign
his
own
testament
or
treat
him
with
a
touch
of
your
act
if
you
think
proper
or
give
him
a
taste
of
blue
plumb
one
thing
only
i
stipulate
that
you
do
hurt
that
fat
broganeer
whatever
he
may
say
or
do
he
a
devilish
good
fellow
and
now
to
business
saying
which
they
noiselessly
departed
but
carefully
as
the
door
was
closed
luke
ear
could
detect
the
sound
his
blood
boiled
with
indignation
and
he
experienced
what
all
must
have
felt
who
have
been
similarly
situated
with
the
will
but
not
the
power
to
assist
another
a
sensation
almost
approaching
to
torture
at
this
moment
a
distant
scream
burst
upon
his
ears
another
he
hesitated
no
longer
with
all
his
force
he
thundered
at
the
door
what
do
you
want

cried
coates
from
without

i
do

something
here
luke
dashed
with
all
his
force
against
the
door
it
yielded
to
the
blow
and
he
stood
before
the
astonished
attorney
advance
a
footstep
villain
exclaimed
coates
presenting
both
his
pistols
and
i
lodge
a
brace
of
balls

your
head

exclaimed
titus
flinging
himself
upon
the
attorney
and
holding
both
his
arms
you
bullied
me
long
enough
i
sure
the
lad
in
the
right
luke
snatched
the
pistols
from
the
hands
of
coates
very
well
tyrconnel
very
well
sir
cried
the
attorney
boiling
with
wrath
and
spluttering
out
his
words
extremely
well

not
perhaps
aware
sir
what
you
have
done
but

word

titus
i
shall

repent
a
action

me
cried
luke
settle
your
disputes
hereafter
quick
or
we
shall
be
too
late
coates
bustled
after
him
and
titus
putting
the
neck
of
the
forbidden
whisky
bottle
to
his
lips
and
gulping
down
a
hasty
mouthful
snatched
up
a
rusty
poker
and
followed
the
party
with
more
alacrity
than
might
have
been
expected
from
so
portly
a
personage
well
gentlemen
is
a
fine
night
for
our
enterprise
dark
as
hell
and
blows
like
the
devil
you
have
no
creature
to
deal
with
but
the
ladies
and
i
can
assure
you
friend
there
a
great
deal
of
address
and
good
manners
in
robbing
a
lady
i
am
the
most
of
a
gentleman
that
way
that
ever
travelled
the
road
accompanied
by
her
son
lady
rookwood
on
quitting
the
chamber
of
the
dead
returned
to
her
own
room
she
then
renewed
all
her
arguments
had
recourse
to
passionate
supplications
to
violent
threats
but
without
effect
ranulph
maintained
profound
silence
passion
as
it
ever
doth
defeated
its
own
ends
and
lady
rookwood
seeing
the
ill
effect
her
anger
would
probably
produce
gradually
softened
the
asperity
of
her
manner
and
suffered
him
to
depart
left
to
herself
and
to
the
communings
of
her
own
troubled
spirit
her
fortitude
in
a
measure
forsook
her
under
the
pressure
of
the
difficulties
by
which
she
was
environed
there
was
no
plan
she
could
devise
no
scheme
adopt
unattended
with
peril
she
must
act
alone
with
promptitude
and
secrecy
to
win
her
son
over
was
her
chief
desire
and
that
at
all
hazards
she
was
resolved
to
do
but
how
she
knew
of
only
one
point
on
which
he
was
vulnerable
his
love
for
eleanor
mowbray
by
raising
doubts
in
his
mind
and
placing
fresh
difficulties
in
his
path
she
might
compel
him
to
acquiesce
in
her
machinations
as
a
necessary
means
of
accomplishing
his
own
object
this
she
hoped
to
effect
still
there
was
a
depth
of
resolution
in
the
placid
stream
of
character
which
she
had
often
noticed
with
apprehension
aware
of
his
firmness
she
dreaded
lest
his
sense
of
justice
should
be
stronger
than
his
passion
as
she
wove
these
webs
of
darkness
fear
hitherto
unknown
took
possession
of
her
soul
she
listened
to
the
howling
of
the
wind
to
the
vibration
of
the
rafters
to
the
thunder
roar
and
to
the
hissing
rain
till
she
who
never
trembled
at
the
thought
of
danger
became
filled
with
vague
uneasiness
lights
were
ordered
and
when
her
old
attendant
returned
lady
rookwood
fixed
a
look
so
wistful
upon
her
that
agnes
ventured
to
address
her
bless
you
my
lady
said
the
ancient
handmaiden
trembling
you
look
very
pale
and
no
wonder
i
feel
sick
at
heart
too
oh
i
shall
be
glad
when
they
return
from
the
church
and
happier
still
when
the
morning
dawns
i
ca
sleep
a
wink
ca
close
my
eyes
but
i
think
of
him
of
of
sir
piers
my
lady
for
though
he
dead
i
do
think
he
gone
how
why
my
lady
the
corruptible
part
of
him
gone
sure
enough
but
the
incorruptible
as
small
calls
it
the
sperrit
my
lady
it
might
be
my
fancy
your
ladyship
but
as
i
standing
here
when
i
went
back
into
the
room
just
now
for
the
lights
as
i
hope
to
live
i
thought
i
saw
sir
piers
in
the
room
you
are
crazed
agnes
no
my
lady
i
not
crazed
it
was
mere
fancy
no
doubt
oh
it
a
blessed
thing
to
live
with
an
easy
conscience
a
thrice
blessed
thing
to
with
an
easy
one
and
that
what
i
never
shall
i
afeard
poor
sir
piers
i
mumble
a
prayer
for
him
if
i
durst
leave
me
said
lady
rookwood
impatiently
and
agnes
quitted
the
room
what
if
the
dead
can
return
thought
lady
rookwood
all
men
doubt
it
yet
all
men
believe
it
would
not
believe
it
were
there
not
a
creeping
horror
that
overmasters
me
when
i
think
of
the
state
beyond
the
grave
that
intermediate
state
for
such
it
must
be
when
the
body
lieth
mouldering
in
the
ground
and
the
soul
survives
to
wander
unconfined
until
the
hour
of
doom
and
doth
the
soul
survive
when
disenthralled
is
it
dependent
on
the
body
does
it
perish
with
the
body
these
are
doubts
i
can
not
resolve
but
if
i
deemed
there
was
no
future
state
this
hand
should
at
once
liberate
me
from
my
own
weaknesses
my
fears
my
life
there
is
but
one
path
to
acquire
that
knowledge
which
once
taken
can
never
be
retraced
i
am
content
to
live
while
living
to
be
feared
it
may
be
hated
when
dead
to
be
contemned
yet
still
remembered
ha
what
sound
was
that
a
stifled
scream
agnes
without
there
she
is
full
of
fears
i
am
not
free
from
them
myself
but
i
will
shake
them
off
this
will
divert
their
channel
continued
she
drawing
from
her
bosom
the
marriage
certificate
this
will
arouse
the
torpid
current
of
my
blood
rookwood
to
susan
and
by
whom
was
it
solemnized
the
name
is
checkley
richard
checkley
ha
i
bethink
me
a
papist
priest
a
recusant
who
was
for
some
time
an
inmate
of
the
hall
i
have
heard
of
this
man
he
was
afterwards
imprisoned
but
escaped
he
is
either
dead
or
in
a
foreign
land
no
witnesses
is
well
methinks
sir
piers
rookwood
did
well
to
preserve
this
it
shall
light
his
funeral
pyre
would
he
could
now
behold
me
as
i
consume
it
she
held
the
paper
in
the
direction
of
the
candle
but
ere
it
could
touch
the
flame
it
dropped
from
her
hand
as
if
her
horrible
wish
had
been
granted
before
her
stood
the
figure
of
her
husband
lady
rookwood
started
not
no
sign
of
trepidation
or
alarm
save
the
sudden
stiffening
of
her
form
was
betrayed
her
bosom
ceased
to
palpitate
her
respiration
stopped
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
apparition
the
figure
appeared
to
regard
her
sternly
it
was
at
some
little
distance
within
the
shade
cast
by
the
lofty
bedstead
still
she
could
distinctly
discern
it
there
was
no
ocular
deception
it
was
attired
in
the
costume
sir
piers
was
wont
to
wear
a
hunting
dress
all
that
her
son
had
told
her
rushed
to
her
recollection
the
phantom
advanced
its
countenance
was
pale
and
wore
a
gloomy
frown
what
would
you
destroy
demanded
the
apparition
in
a
hollow
tone
the
evidence
of
what
your
marriage
with
yourself
accursed
woman
with
susan
bradley
what
that
i
hear
shouted
the
figure
in
an
altered
tone
married
to
her
then
luke
legitimate
and
heir
to
this
estate
whereupon
the
apparition
rushed
to
the
table
and
laid
a
very
substantial
grasp
upon
the
document
a
marriage
certificate
ejaculated
the
spectre
here
a
piece
of
luck
it
ai
often
in
our
lottery
life
we
draw
a
prize
like
this
one
way
or
the
other
it
must
turn
up
a
few
cool
thousands
restore
that
paper
villain
exclaimed
lady
rookwood
recovering
all
the
audacity
natural
to
her
character
the
instant
she
discovered
the
earthly
nature
of
the
intruder
restore
it
or
by
heaven
you
shall
rue
your
temerity
softly
softly
replied
the
with
one
hand
pushing
back
the
lady
while
the
other
conveyed
the
precious
document
to
the
custody
of
his
nether
man
softly
said
he
giving
the
buckskin
pocket
a
slap
two
words
to
that
my
lady
i
know
its
value
as
well
as
yourself
and
must
make
my
market
the
highest
offer
has
me
your
ladyship
but
a
poor
auctioneer
that
knocks
down
his
ware
when
only
one
bidder
is
present
luke
bradley
or
as
i
find
he
now
is
sir
luke
rookwood
may
come
down
more
handsomely
who
are
you
ruffian
and
to
what
end
is
this
masquerade
assumed
if
for
the
purpose
of
terrifying
me
into
compliance
with
the
schemes
of
that
madman
luke
bradley
whom
i
presume
to
be
your
confederate
your
labor
is
misspent
your
stolen
disguise
has
no
more
weight
with
me
than
his
forged
claims
forged
claims
egad
he
must
be
a
clever
hand
to
have
forged
that
certificate
your
ladyship
however
is
in
error
sir
luke
rookwood
is
no
associate
of
mine
i
am
his
late
father
friend
but
i
have
no
time
to
bandy
talk

money
have
you

house

alive
you
a
robber
then
not
i
a
a
collector
of
ha
ha
what
plate
have
you
got
nay
do
be
alarmed
take
it
quietly
these
things
ca
be
helped
better
make
up
your
mind
to
do
it
without
more
ado
much
the
best
plan
no
screaming
it
may
injure
your
lungs
and
can
alarm
nobody
your
maids
have
done
as
much
before
it
beneath
your
dignity
to
make
so
much
noise
so
you
will
not
heed
me
as
you
will
saying
which
he
deliberately
cut
the
and
drew
out
a
brace
of
pistols
at
the
same
time
agnes
shrieked
lady
rookwood
now
seriously
alarmed
i
must
caution
your
ladyship
to
be
silent
said
the
robber
who
as
our
readers
will
no
doubt
have
already
conjectured
was
no
other
than
the
redoubted
jack
palmer
agnes
is
already
disposed
of
said
he
cocking
a
pistol
however
like
your
deceased
and
master
i
may
appear
you
will
find
you
have
got
a
very
different
spirit
from
that
of
sir
piers
to
deal
with
i
am
naturally
the
politest
man
breathing
have
been
accounted
the
man
on
the
road
by
every
lady
whom
i
have
had
the
honor
of
addressing
and
i
should
be
sorry
to
sully
my
reputation
by
anything
like
rudeness
i
must
use
a
little
force
of
the
gentlest
kind
perhaps
you
will
permit
me
to
hand
you
to
a
chair
bless
me
what
a
wrist
your
ladyship
has
got
excuse
me
if
i
hurt
you
but
you
are
so
devilish
strong
what
ho
piers
rookwood
calls
ready
cried
a
voice
that
the
word
rejoined
another
ready
and
immediately
two
men
their
features
entirely
hidden
by
a
shroud
of
black
crape
accoutred
in
rough
attire
and
each
armed
with
pistols
rushed
into
the
room
lend
a
hand
said
jack
even
in
this
perilous
extremity
lady
rookwood
courage
did
not
desert
her
anticipating
their
purpose
ere
her
assailants
could
reach
her
she
extricated
herself
from
palmer
grasp
and
rushed
upon
the
foremost
so
unexpectedly
that
before
the
man
could
seize
her
she
snatched
a
pistol
from
his
hand
and
presented
it
at
the
group
with
an
aspect
like
that
of
a
tigress
at
bay
her
eye
wandering
from
one
to
the
other
as
if
selecting
a
mark
there
was
a
pause
of
a
few
seconds
in
which
the
men
glanced
at
the
lady
and
then
at
their
leader
jack
looked
blank
hem
said
he
coolly
this
is
something
new
disarmed
defied
by
a
petticoat
hark
ye
rob
rust
the
disgrace
rests
with
you
clear
your
character
by
securing
her
at
once
what
afraid
of
a
woman
a
woman
repeated
rust
in
a
surly
tone
devilish
like
a
woman
indeed
few
men
could
do
what
she
has
done
give
the
word
and
i
fire
as
to
seizing
her
that
more
than
i
engage
to
do
you
are
a
coward
cried
jack
i
will
steer
clear
of
blood
if
i
can
help
it
come
madam
surrender
like
the
more
sensible
part
of
your
sex
at
discretion
you
will
find
resistance
of
no
avail
and
he
stepped
boldly
towards
her
lady
rookwood
pulled
the
trigger
the
pistol
flashed
in
the
pan
she
flung
away
the
useless
weapon
without
a
word
ha
ha
said
jack
as
he
leisurely
stooped
to
pick
up
the
pistol
and
approached
her
ladyship
the
bullet
is
not
yet
cast
that
is
to
be
my
billet
here
said
he
dealing
rust
a
heavy
thump
upon
the
shoulder
with
the
of
the
piece
take
back
your
snapper
and
look
you
prick
the
touchhole
or
your
will
never
bite
for
you
and
now
madam
i
must
take
the
liberty
of
again
handing
you
to
a
seat
dick
wilder
the
cord
quick
it
distresses
me
to
proceed
to
such
lengths
with
your
ladyship
but
safe
bind
safe
find
as
coates
would
say
you
will
not
bind
me
ruffian
your
ladyship
is
very
much
mistaken
i
have
no
alternative
your
ladyship
wrist
is
far
too
dexterous
to
be
at
liberty
i
must
furthermore
request
of
your
ladyship
to
be
less
vociferous
you
interrupt
business
which
should
be
transacted
with
silence
and
deliberation
lady
rookwood
rage
and
vexation
at
this
indignity
were
beyond
all
bounds
resistance
however
was
useless
and
she
submitted
in
silence
the
cord
was
passed
tightly
round
her
arms
when
it
flashed
upon
her
recollection
for
the
first
time
that
coates
and
tyrconnel
who
were
in
charge
of
her
captive
in
the
lower
corridor
might
be
summoned
to
her
assistance
this
idea
no
sooner
crossed
her
mind
than
she
uttered
a
loud
and
prolonged
scream
cried
jack
civility
is
wasted
here
give
me
the
gag
rob
better
slit
her
at
once
replied
rust
drawing
his
clasped
knife

thwart
everything

say

ca

the
gag
exclaimed
wilder
savagely
leave
rob
rust
to
manage
her
he
silence
her
i
warrant
you
while
you
and
i
rummage
the
room
ay
leave
her
to
me
said
the
other
miscreant
go
about
your
business
and
take
no
heed
her
hands
are
fast
she
ca
scratch
do
it
with
a
single
gash
send
her
to
join
her
lord
whom
she
loved
so
well
before
he
under
ground
they
have
something
to
see
when
they
come
home
from
the
master
funeral
their
mistress
and
for
another
ho

shrieked
lady
rookwood
ay
ay
i
be

said
rust
brandishing
his
knife
before
her
eyes
i
not
be
long
about
it
leave
her
to
me
i
give
her
a
taste
of
sir
sydney
no
no
rust
no
bloodshed
said
jack
authoritatively
i
find
some
other
way
to
gag
the
jade
at
this
moment
a
noise
of
rapid
footsteps
was
heard
within
the
passage
assistance
comes
screamed
lady
rookwood
help
help
to
the
door
cried
jack
the
words
were
scarcely
out
of
his
mouth
before
luke
dashed
into
the
room
followed
by
coates
and
tyrconnel
palmer
and
his
companions
levelled
their
pistols
at
the
intruders
and
the
latter
would
have
fired
but
jack
keen
eye
having
discerned
luke
amongst
the
foremost
checked
further
hostilities
for
the
present
lady
rookwood
meanwhile
finding
herself
free
from
restraint
rushed
towards
her
deliverers
and
crouched
beneath
luke
protecting
arms
which
were
extended
pistol
in
hand
over
her
head
behind
them
stood
titus
tyrconnel
flourishing
the
poker
and
coates
who
upon
the
sight
of
so
much
warlike
preparation
began
somewhat
to
repent
having
rushed
so
precipitately
into
the
lion
den
luke
bradley
exclaimed
palmer
stepping
forward
luke
bradley
echoed
lady
rookwood
recoiling
and
staring
into
his
face
fear
nothing
madam
cried
luke
i
am
here
to
assist
you
i
will
defend
you
with
my
life
defend
exclaimed
lady
rookwood
doubtfully
even
cried
luke
strange
as
it
may
sound
holy
powers
protect
me
ejaculated
titus
as
i
live
it
is
sir
piers
himself
sir
piers
echoed
coates
catching
the
infection
of
terror
as
he
perceived
palmer
more
distinctly
what
is
the
dead
come
to
life
again
a
ghost
a
ghost
by
my
soul
cried
titus
it
the
first
ghost
i
ever
heard
of
that
committed
a
burglary
in
its
own
house
and
on
the
night
of
the
burial
too
but
who
the
devil
are
these
maybe
they
ghosts
likewise
they
are
said
palmer
in
a
hollow
tone
mimicking
the
voice
of
sir
piers
attendant
spirits
we
are
come
for
this
woman
her
time
is
out
so
no
more
palavering
titus

a
hand
to
take
her
to
the
churchyard
and
be
hanged
to
you

my
conscience

cried
titus
it
either
the
devil
or
sir
piers
we
be
only
in
the
way
here
he
only
just
settling
his
old
scores
with
his
lady
i
thought
it
would
come
to
this
long
ago
best
beat
a
retreat
jack
took
advantage
of
the
momentary
confusion
created
by
this
incidental
alarm
at
his
disguise
to
direct
rust
towards
the
door
by
which
the
new
comers
had
entered
and
this
being
accomplished
he
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
what
not
know
me
cried
he
not
know
your
old
friend
with
a
new
face
luke
nor
you
titus
nor

no
other
than

a
dozen

he
in
a
whisper

plunder
here
no

come
to
that
youngster
his
life

worth
thousands
to
us
then
turning
to
luke
he
continued
i
loth
to

you
yet
what

i
do
you
must
have
the
worst
of
it
if

throats

to
a
certainty
and
though
these
rascals
will
as
certainly
be
hanged
for
it
that
will
be
poor
satisfaction
to
the
sufferers
had
we
not
better
refer
the
matter
to
arbitration
i
for
fighting

out
said
titus

the
poker
round
his

a
flail
in

up

said
coates
lady
rookwood
had
apparently
listened
to
this
singular
conference
with
sullen
composure
though
in
reality
she
was
racked
with
anxiety
as
to
its
results
and
now
apprehending
that
palmer
was
about
to
make
an
immediate
disclosure
to

beaumont
and
fletcher
morning
i
had
a
sister
who
among
the
race
of
gipsies
was
the
fairest
fair
she
was
in
gentle
blood
and
gesture
to
her
beauty
brome
on
quitting
lady
rookwood
chamber
luke
speeded
along
the
gloomy
corridor
descended
the
spiral
stairs
and
swiftly
traversing
sundry
other
dark
passages
issued
from
a
door
at
the
back
of
the
house
day
was
just
beginning
to
break
his
first
object
had
been
to
furnish
himself
with
means
to
expedite
his
flight
and
perceiving
no
one
in
the
yard
he
directed
his
hasty
steps
towards
the
stable
the
door
was
fortunately
unfastened
and
entering
he
found
a
strong
roan
horse
which
he
knew
from
description
had
been
his
father
favorite
hunter
and
to
the
use
of
which
he
now
considered
himself
fully
entitled
the
animal
roused
himself
as
he
approached
shook
his
glossy
coat
and
neighed
as
if
he
recognized
the
footsteps
and
voice
thou
art
mistaken
old
fellow
said
luke
i
am
not
he
thou
thinkest
nevertheless
i
am
glad
thy
instinct
would
have
it
so
if
thou
bearest
my
father
son
as
thou
hast
borne
thy
old
master
many
a
field
for
many
a
day
he
need
not
fear
the
best
mounted
of
his
pursuers
soho
come
hither
rook
the
noble
steed
turned
at
the
call
luke
hastily
saddled
him
vaulted
upon
his
back
and
disregarding
every
impediment
in
the
shape
of
fence
or
ditch
shaped
his
course
across
the
field
towards
the
cottage
which
he
reached
just
as
its
owner
was
in
the
act
of
unlocking
his
door
peter
testified
his
delight
and
surprise
at
the
escape
of
his
grandson
by
a
greeting
of
chuckling
laughter
how
escaped
exclaimed
he
who
has
delivered
you
from
the
hands
of
the
moabites
ha
ha
but
why
do
i
ask
who
could
it
have
been
but
jack
palmer
my
own
hands
have
set
me
free
returned
luke
i
am
indebted
to
no
man
for
liberty
still
less
to
but
i
can
not
tarry
here
each
moment
is
precious
i
came
to
request
you
to
accompany
me
to
the
gipsy
encampment
will
you
go
or
not
and
mount
behind
you
replied
peter
i
like
not
the
manner
of
conveyance
farewell
then
and
luke
turned
to
depart
stay
that
is
sir
piers
horse
old
rook
i
care
not
if
i
do
ride
him
quick
then
mount
i
will
not
delay
you
a
moment
rejoined
the
sexton
opening
his
door
and
throwing
his
implements
into
the
cottage
back
mole
back
sir
cried
he
as
the
dog
rushed
out
to
greet
him
bring
your
steed
nigh
this
stone
grandson
luke
there
a
little
nearer
all
right
and
away
they
galloped
the
sexton
first
inquiries
were
directed
to
ascertain
how
luke
had
accomplished
his
escape
and
having
satisfied
himself
in
this
particular
he
was
content
to
remain
silent
musing
it
might
be
on
the
incidents
detailed
to
him
the
road
luke
chose
was
a
rough
unfrequented
lane
that
skirted
for
nearly
a
mile
the
palings
of
the
park
it
then
diverged
to
the
right
and
seemed
to
bear
towards
a
range
of
hills
rising
in
the
distance
high
hedges
impeded
the
view
on
either
hand
but
there
were
occasional
gaps
affording
glimpses
of
the
tract
of
country
through
which
he
was
riding
meadows
were
seen
steaming
with
heavy
dews
intersected
by
a
deep
channelled
stream
whose
course
was
marked
by
a
hanging
cloud
of
vapor
as
well
as
by
a
row
of
melancholy
that
stood
like
stripped
shivering
urchins
by
the
river
side
other
fields
succeeded
yellow
with
golden
grain
or
bright
with
flowering
clover
the
autumnal
crop
colored
with
every
shade
from
the
light
green
of
the
turnip
to
the
darker
verdure
of
the
bean
the
various
products
of
the
teeming
land
the
whole
was
backed
by
round
drowsy
masses
of
trees
luke
spoke
not
nor
abated
his
furious
course
till
the
road
began
to
climb
a
steep
ascent
he
then
drew
in
the
rein
and
from
the
heights
of
the
acclivity
surveyed
the
plain
over
which
he
had
passed
it
was
a
rich
agricultural
district
with
little
picturesque
beauty
but
much
of
true
english
endearing
loveliness
to
recommend
it
such
a
quiet
pleasing
landscape
in
short
as
one
views
at
such
a
season
of
the
year
from
every
eminence
in
every
county
of
our
merry
isle
the
picture
was
made
up
of
a
tract
of
land
filled
with
corn
ripe
for
the
sickle
or
studded
with
sheaves
of
the
same
golden
produce
enlivened
with
green
meadows
so
deeply
luxuriant
as
to
claim
the
scythe
for
the
second
time
each
divided
from
the
other
by
thick
hedgerows
the
uniformity
of
which
was
broken
ever
and
anon
by
some
towering
elm
tall
poplar
or
oak
many
old
farmhouses
with
their
broad
barns
and
crowded
haystacks
forming
little
villages
in
themselves
ornamented
the
landscape
at
different
points
and
by
their
substantial
look
evidenced
the
fertility
of
the
soil
and
the
thriving
condition
of
its
inhabitants
some
three
miles
distant
might
be
seen
the
scattered
hamlet
of
rookwood
the
dark
russet
thatch
of
its
houses
scarcely
perceptible
amidst
the
embrowned
foliage
of
the
surrounding
timber
the
site
of
the
village
was
however
pointed
out
by
the
square
tower
of
the
antique
church
that
crested
the
summit
of
the
adjoining
hill
and
although
the
hall
was
entirely
hidden
from
view
luke
readily
traced
out
its
locality
amidst
the
depths
of
the
dark
grove
in
which
it
was
embosomed
this
goodly
prospect
had
other
claims
to
attention
in
luke
eyes
besides
its
agricultural
or
pictorial
merit
it
was
or
he
deemed
it
was
his
own
far
as
his
eye
ranged
yea
even
beyond
the
line
of
vision
the
estates
of
rookwood
extended
do
you
see
that
house
below
us
in
the
valley
asked
peter
of
his
companion
i
do
replied
luke
a
snug
old
house
a
model
of
a
farm
everything
looks
comfortable
and
well
to
do
about
it
there
are
a
dozen
lusty
haystacks
or
thereabouts
and
the
great
barn
with
its
roof
yellowed
like
gold
looks
built
for
a
granary
and
there
are
stables
orchards
dovecots
and
fishponds
and
an
old
circular
garden
with
in
abundance
he
should
be
a
happy
man
and
a
wealthy
one
who
dwells
therein
he
dwells
therein
no
longer
returned
peter
he
died
last
night
how
know
you
that
none
are
stirring
in
the
house
as
yet
the
owner
of
that
house
simon
toft
replied
peter
was
last
night
struck
by
a
thunderbolt
he
was
one
of
the
at
your
father
funeral
they
are
sleeping
within
the
house
you
say
is
well
let
them
sleep
on
they
will
awaken
too
soon
wake
when
they
may
ha
ha
peace
cried
luke
you
blight
everything
even
this
smiling
landscape
you
would
turn
to
gloom
does
not
this
morn
awaken
a
happier
train
of
thoughts
within
your
mind
with
me
it
makes
amends
for
want
of
sleep
effaces
resentment
and
banishes
every
black
misgiving
is
a
joyous
thing
thus
to
scour
the
country
at
earliest
dawn
to
catch
all
the
spirit
and
freshness
of
the
morning
to
be
abroad
before
the
lazy
world
is
half
awake
to
make
the
most
of
a
brief
existence
and
to
have
spent
a
day
of
keen
enjoyment
almost
before
the
day
begins
with
some
i
like
to
anticipate
the
rising
of
the
glorious
luminary
to
watch
every
line
of
light
changing
as
at
this
moment
from
shuddering
gray
to
blushing
rose
see
how
the
heavens
are
dyed
who
would
exchange
yon
gorgeous
spectacle
continued
he
pointing
towards
the
east
and
again
urging
his
horse
to
full
speed
down
the
hill
endangering
the
sexton
seat
and
threatening
to
impale
him
upon
the
crupper
of
the
saddle
who
would
exchange
that
sight
and
the
exhilarating
feeling
of
this
fresh
morn
for
a
couch
of
eiderdown
and
a
headache
in
reversion
i
for
one
returned
the
sexton
sharply
would
willingly
exchange
it
for
that
or
any
other
couch
provided
it
rid
me
of
this
accursed
crupper
which
galls
me
sorely
moderate
your
pace
grandson
luke
or
i
must
throw
myself
off
the
horse
in
luke
slackened
his
charger
pace
in
compliance
with
the
sexton
wish
ah
well
continued
peter
restored
in
a
measure
to
comfort
now
i
can
contemplate
the
sunrise
which
you
laud
somewhat
at
mine
ease
is
a
fine
sight
i
doubt
not
to
the
eyes
of
youth
and
to
the
sanguine
soul
of
him
upon
whom
life
itself
is
dawning
is
i
dare
say
inspiriting
but
when
the
heyday
of
existence
is
past
when
the
blood
flows
sluggishly
in
the
veins
when
one
has
known
the
desolating
storms
which
the
brightest
sunrise
has
preceded
the
seared
heart
refuses
to
trust
its
false
glitter
and
like
the
experienced
sailor
sees
oft
in
the
brightest
skies
a
forecast
of
the
tempest
to
such
a
one
there
can
be
no
new
dawn
of
the
heart
no
sun
can
gild
its
cold
and
cheerless
horizon
no
breeze
can
revive
pulses
that
have
long
since
ceased
to
throb
with
any
chance
emotion
i
am
too
old
to
feel
freshness
in
this
nipping
air
it
chills
me
more
than
the
damps
of
night
to
which
i
am
accustomed
night
midnight
is
my
season
of
delight
nature
is
instinct
then
with
secrets
dark
and
dread
there
is
a
language
which
he
who
sleepeth
not
but
will
wake
and
watch
may
haply
learn
strange
organs
of
speech
hath
the
invisible
world
strange
language
doth
it
talk
strange
communion
hold
with
him
who
would
pry
into
its
mysteries
it
talks
by
bat
and
owl
by
the
and
by
each
crawling
thing
by
the
dust
of
graves
as
well
as
by
those
that
rot
therein
but
ever
doth
it
discourse
by
night
and
specially
when
the
moon
is
at
the
full
is
the
lore
i
have
then
learned
that
makes
that
season
dear
to
me
like
your
cat
mine
eye
expands
in
darkness
i
blink
at
the
sunshine
like
your
owl
cease
this
forbidding
strain
returned
luke
it
sounds
as
harshly
as
your
own
cry
let
your
thoughts
take
a
more
sprightly
turn
more
in
unison
with
my
own
and
the
fair
aspect
of
nature
shall
i
direct
them
to
the
gipsies
camp
then
said
peter
with
a
sneer
do
your
own
thoughts
tend
thither
you
are
not
altogether
in
the
wrong
replied
luke
i
thinking
of
the
gipsies
camp
and
of
one
who
dwells
amongst
its
tents
i
knew
it
replied
peter
did
you
hope
to
deceive
me
by
attributing
all
your
joyousness
of
heart
to
the
dawn
your
thoughts
have
been
wandering
all
this
while
upon
one
who
hath
i
will
engage
a
pair
of
eyes
an
olive
skin
and
yet
withal
a
clear
one
yet
comely
as
the
tents
of
kedar
as
the
curtains
of
solomon
a
mesh
of
jetty
hair
that
hath
entangled
you
in
its
network
ripe
lips
and
a
cunning
tongue
one
of
the
plagues
of
ha
ha
you
have
guessed
shrewdly
replied
luke
i
care
not
to
own
that
my
thoughts
were
so
occupied
i
was
assured
of
it
replied
the
sexton
and
what
may
be
the
name
of
her
towards
whom
your
imagination
was
straying
sibila
perez
replied
luke
her
father
was
a
spanish
gitano
she
is
known
amongst
her
people
by
her
mother
name
of
lovel
she
is
beautiful
of
course
ay
very
beautiful
but
no
matter
you
shall
judge
of
her
charms
anon
i
will
take
your
word
for
them
returned
the
sexton
and
you
love
her
passionately
you
are
not
married
asked
peter
hastily
not
as
yet
replied
luke
but
my
faith
is
plighted
heaven
be
praised
the
mischief
is
not
then
irreparable
i
would
have
you
married
though
not
to
a
gipsy
girl
and
whom
would
you
select
one
before
whom
sybil
beauty
would
pale
as
stars
at
day
approach
there
lives
not
such
a
one
trust
me
there
does
eleanor
mowbray
is
lovely
beyond
parallel
i
was
merely
speculating
upon
a
possibility
when
i
wished
her
yours
it
is
scarcely
likely
she
would
cast
her
eyes
upon
you
i
shall
not
heed
her
neglect
graced
with
my
title
i
doubt
not
were
it
my
pleasure
to
seek
a
bride
amongst
those
of
gentle
blood
i
should
not
find
all
indifferent
to
my
suit
possibly
not
yet
what
might
weigh
with
others
would
not
weigh
with
her
there
are
qualities
you
lack
which
she
has
discovered
in
another
in
whom
in
ranulph
rookwood
is
her
suitor
i
have
reason
to
think
so
and
you
would
have
me
abandon
my
own
betrothed
love
to
beguile
from
my
brother
his
destined
bride
that
were
to
imitate
the
conduct
of
my
grandsire
the
terrible
sir
reginald
towards
brother
alan
the
sexton
answered
not
and
luke
fancied
he
could
perceive
a
quivering
in
the
hands
that
grasped
his
body
for
support
there
was
a
brief
pause
in
their
conversation
and
who
is
eleanor
mowbray
asked
luke
breaking
the
silence
your
cousin
on
the
mother
side
a
rookwood
is
therefore
i
would
urge
your
union
with
her
there
is
a
prophecy
relating
to
your
house
which
seems
as
though
it
would
be
fulfilled
in
your
person
and
in
hers
when
the
stray
rook
shall
perch
on
the
topmost
bough
there
shall
be
clamor
and
screaming
i
trow
but
of
right
and
of
rule
of
the
ancient
nest
the
rook
that
with
rook
mates
shall
hold
him
possest
i
place
no
faith
in
such
fantasies
replied
luke
and
yet
the
lines
bear
strangely
upon
my
present
situation
their
application
to
yourself
and
eleanor
mowbray
is
unquestionable
replied
the
sexton
it
would
seem
so
indeed
rejoined
luke
and
he
again
sank
into
abstraction
from
which
the
sexton
did
not
care
to
arouse
him
the
aspect
of
the
country
had
materially
changed
since
their
descent
of
the
hill
in
place
of
the
district
which
lay
on
the
other
side
a
broad
brown
tract
of
waste
land
spread
out
before
them
covered
with
scattered
patches
of
gorse
stunted
fern
and
low
brushwood
presenting
an
unvaried
surface
of
unbaked
turf
the
shallow
coat
of
sod
was
manifested
by
the
stones
that
clattered
under
the
horse
hoofs
as
he
rapidly
traversed
the
arid
soil
clearing
with
ease
to
himself
though
not
without
discomfort
to
the
sexton
every
gravelly
trench
natural
chasm
or
other
inequality
of
ground
that
occurred
in
his
course
clinging
to
his
grandson
with
the
tenacity
of
a
bird
of
prey
peter
for
some
time
kept
his
station
in
security
but
unluckily
at
one
dike
rather
wider
than
the
rest
the
horse
owing
possibly
to
the
mismanagement
intentional
or
otherwise
of
luke
swerved
and
the
sexton
dislodged
from
his
high
estate
fell
at
the
edge
of
the
trench
and
rolled
incontinently
to
the
bottom
luke
drew
in
the
rein
to
inquire
if
any
bones
were
broken
and
peter
presently
upreared
his
dusty
person
from
the
abyss
and
without
condescending
to
make
any
reply
yet
muttering
curses
not
loud
but
deep
accepted
his
grandson
proffered
hand
and
remounted
while
thus
occupied
luke
fancied
he
heard
a
distant
shout
and
noting
whence
the
sound
proceeded
the
same
quarter
by
which
he
had
approached
the
heath
he
beheld
a
single
horseman
spurring
in
their
direction
at
the
top
of
his
speed
and
to
judge
from
the
rate
at
which
he
advanced
it
was
evident
he
was
anything
but
indifferently
mounted
apprehensive
of
pursuit
luke
expedited
the
sexton
ascent
and
that
accomplished
without
bestowing
further
regard
upon
the
object
of
his
solicitude
he
resumed
his
headlong
flight
he
now
thought
it
necessary
to
bestow
more
attention
on
his
choice
of
road
and
perfectly
acquainted
with
the
heath
avoided
all
unnecessary
hazardous
passes
in
spite
of
his
knowledge
of
the
ground
and
the
excellence
of
his
horse
the
stranger
sensibly
gained
upon
him
the
danger
however
was
no
longer
imminent
we
are
safe
cried
luke
the
limits
of
hardchase
are
past
in
a
few
seconds
we
shall
enter
davenham
wood
i
will
turn
the
horse
loose
and
we
will
betake
ourselves
to
flight
amongst
the
trees
i
will
show
you
a
place
of
concealment
he
can
not
follow
us
on
horseback
and
on
foot
i
defy
him
stay
cried
the
sexton
he
is
not
in
pursuit
he
takes
another
course
he
wheels
to
the
right
by
heaven
it
is
the
fiend
himself
upon
a
black
horse
come
for
ben
see
he
is
there
already
the
horseman
had
turned
as
the
sexton
stated
careering
towards
a
revolting
object
at
some
little
distance
on
the
right
hand
it
was
a
gibbet
with
its
grisly
burden
he
rode
swiftly
towards
it
and
reining
in
his
horse
took
off
his
hat
bowing
profoundly
to
the
carcase
that
swung
in
the
morning
breeze
just
at
that
moment
a
gust
of
air
catching
the
fleshless
skeleton
its
arms
seemed
to
be
waved
in
reply
to
the
salutation
a
solitary
crow
winged
its
flight
over
the
horseman
head
as
he
paused
after
a
moment
halt
he
wheeled
about
and
again
shouted
to
luke
waving
his
hat
as
i
live
said
the
latter
it
is
jack
palmer
dick
turpin
you
mean
rejoined
the
sexton
he
has
been
paying
his
respects
to
a
brother
blade
ha
ha
dick
will
never
have
the
honor
of
a
gibbet
he
is
too
tender
of
the
knife
did
you
mark
the
crow
but
here
he
comes
and
in
another
instant
turpin
was
by
their
side
gipsy
i
see
a
column
of
smoke
the
lofty
wood
that
skirts
the
wild
cowper
the
top
of
the
morning
to
you
said
turpin
as
he
rode
up
at
an
easy
canter
did
you
not
hear
my
halloo
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
you
on
the
hill
yonder
i
knew
you
both
two
miles
off
and
so
having
a
word
or
two
to
say
to
you
luke
bradley
before
i
leave
this
part
of
the
country
i
put
bess
to
it
and
she
soon
brought
me
within
hail
bless
her
black
skin
added
he
affectionately
patting
his
horse
neck
there
not
her
match
in
these
parts
or
in
any
other
she
wants
no
coaxing
to
do
her
work
no
bleeders
for
her
i
should
have
been
up
with
you
before
this
had
i
not
taken
a
cross
cut
to
look
at
poor
ben
one
night
when
mounted
on
my
mare
to
bagshot
heath
i
did
repair
and
saw
will
davies
hanging
there
upon
the
gibbet
bleak
and
bare
a
rustified
fustified
mustified
excuse
my
singing
the
sight
of
a
gibbet
always
puts
me
in
mind
of
the
golden
farmer
may
i
ask
whither
you
are
bound
comrades
comrades
whispered
the
sexton
to
luke
you
see
does
not
so
easily
forget
his
old
friends
i
have
business
that
will
not
admit
of
delay
rejoined
luke
and
to
speak
plainly
you
want
not
my
society
returned
turpin
i
guessed
as
much
natural
enough
you
have
got
an
inkling
of
your
good
fortune
you
have
found
out
you
are
a
rich
man
heir
not
a
poor
wench
bastard
no
offence
i
a
plain
spoken
man
as
you
will
find
if
you
know
it
not
already
i
have
no
objection
to
your
playing
these
fine
tricks
on
others
though
it
wo
answer
your
turn
to
do
so
with
me
sir
exclaimed
luke
sharply
sir
to
you
replied
turpin
sir
luke
as
i
suppose
you
would
now
choose
to
be
addressed
i
am
aware
of
all
a
nod
is
as
good
as
a
wink
to
me
last
night
i
learned
the
fact
of
sir
piers
marriage
from
lady
rookwood
ay
from
her
ladyship
you
stare
and
old
peter
there
opens
his
ogles
now
she
let
it
out
by
accident
and
i
am
in
possession
of
what
can
alone
substantiate
your
father
first
marriage
and
establish
your
claims
to
the
property
the
devil
cried
the
sexton
adding
in
a
whisper
to
luke
you
had
better
not
be
precipitate
in
dropping
so
obliging
an
acquaintance
you
are
jesting
said
luke
to
turpin
it
is
ill
jesting
before
breakfast
returned
dick
i
am
seldom
in
the
mood
for
a
joke
so
early
what
if
a
certain
marriage
certificate
had
fallen
into
my
hand
a
marriage
certificate
echoed
luke
and
the
sexton
simultaneously
the
only
existing
proof
of
the
union
of
sir
piers
rookwood
with
susan
bradley
continued
turpin
what
if
i
had
stumbled
upon
such
a
document
nay
more
if
i
knew
where
to
direct
you
to
it
peace
cried
luke
to
his
tormentor
and
then
addressing
turpin
if
what
you
say
be
true
my
quest
is
at
an
end
all
that
i
need
you
appear
to
possess
other
proofs
are
secondary
to
this
i
know
with
whom
i
have
to
deal
what
do
you
demand
for
that
certificate
we
will
talk
about
the
matter
after
breakfast
said
turpin
i
wish
to
treat
with
you
as
friend
with
friend
meet
me
on
those
terms
and
i
am
your
man
reject
my
offer
and
i
turn
my
mare
head
and
ride
back
to
rookwood
with
me
now
rest
all
your
hopes
i
have
dealt
fairly
with
you
and
i
expect
to
be
fairly
dealt
with
in
return
it
were
idle
to
say
now
i
have
an
opportunity
that
i
should
not
turn
this
luck
to
my
account
i
were
a
fool
to
do
otherwise
you
can
not
expect
it
and
then
i
have
rust
and
wilder
to
settle
with
though
i
have
left
them
behind
they
know
my
destination
we
have
been
old
associates
i
like
your
spirit
i
care
not
for
your
haughtiness
but
i
will
not
help
you
up
the
ladder
to
be
kicked
down
myself
now
you
understand
me
whither
are
you
bound
to
davenham
priory
the
gipsy
camp
the
gipsies
are
your
friends
they
are
i
am
alone
you
are
safe
you
pledge
your
word
that
all
shall
be
on
the
square
you
will
not
mention
to
one
of
that
canting
crew
what
i
have
told
you
with
one
exception
you
may
rely
upon
my
secrecy
whom
do
you
except
a
woman
bad
never
trust
a
petticoat
i
will
answer
for
her
with
my
life
and
for
your
granddad
there
he
will
answer
for
himself
said
peter
you
need
not
fear
treachery
in
me
honor
among
thieves
you
know
or
where
else
should
you
seek
it
rejoined
turpin
for
it
has
left
all
other
classes
of
society
your
highwayman
is
your
only
man
of
honor
i
will
trust
you
both
and
you
shall
find
you
may
trust
me
after
breakfast
as
i
said
before
we
will
bring
the
matter
to
a
conclusion
tip
us
your
daddle
sir
luke
and
i
am
satisfied
you
shall
rule
in
rookwood
i
engage
ere
a
week
be
flown
and
then
but
so
much
parleying
is
dull
work
let
make
the
best
of
our
way
to
breakfast
and
away
they
cantered
a
narrow
conducted
them
singly
through
the
defiles
of
a
thick
wood
their
route
lay
in
the
shade
and
the
air
felt
chilly
amidst
the
trees
the
sun
not
having
attained
sufficient
altitude
to
penetrate
its
depths
while
overhead
all
was
warmth
and
light
quivering
on
the
tops
of
the
timber
the
horizontal
sunbeams
created
in
their
refraction
brilliant
prismatic
colorings
and
filled
the
air
with
motes
like
golden
dust
our
horsemen
heeded
not
the
sunshine
or
the
shade
occupied
each
with
his
own
train
of
thought
they
silently
rode
on
davenham
wood
through
which
they
urged
their
course
had
in
the
olden
time
been
a
forest
of
some
extent
it
was
then
an
appendage
to
the
domains
of
rookwood
but
had
passed
from
the
hands
of
that
family
to
those
of
a
wealthy
adjoining
landowner
and
lawyer
sir
edward
davenham
in
the
keeping
of
whose
descendants
it
had
ever
after
continued
a
noble
wood
it
was
and
numbered
many
patriarchal
trees
ancient
oaks
with
broad
gnarled
limbs
which
the
storms
of
five
hundred
years
had
vainly
striven
to
uproot
and
which
were
now
sternly
decaying
gigantic
beech
trees
with
silvery
stems
shooting
smoothly
upwards
sustaining
branches
of
such
size
that
each
dissevered
would
in
itself
have
formed
a
tree
populous
with
leaves
and
variegated
with
rich
autumnal
tints
the
sprightly
sycamore
the
dark
chestnut
the
weird
the
majestic
elm
itself
festooned
with
ivy
every
variety
of
wood
dark
dense
and
intricate
composed
the
forest
through
which
they
rode
and
so
multitudinous
was
the
timber
so
closely
planted
so
entirely
filled
up
with
a
thick
matted
vegetation
which
had
been
allowed
to
collect
beneath
that
little
view
was
afforded
had
any
been
desired
by
the
parties
into
the
labyrinth
of
the
grove
tree
after
tree
clad
in
the
glowing
livery
of
the
season
was
passed
and
as
rapidly
succeeded
by
others
occasionally
a
bough
projected
over
their
path
compelling
the
riders
to
incline
their
heads
as
they
passed
but
heedless
of
such
difficulties
they
pressed
on
now
the
road
grew
lighter
and
they
became
at
once
sensible
of
the
genial
influence
of
the
sun
the
transition
was
as
agreeable
as
instantaneous
they
had
opened
upon
an
extensive
plantation
of
pines
whose
tall
branchless
stems
grew
up
like
a
forest
of
masts
and
freely
admitted
the
pleasant
sunshine
beneath
those
trees
the
soil
was
sandy
and
destitute
of
all
undergrowth
though
covered
with
brown
fibres
and
dry
cones
shed
by
the
pines
the
agile
squirrel
that
freest
denizen
of
the
grove
starting
from
the
ground
as
the
horsemen
galloped
on
sprang
up
the
nearest
tree
and
might
be
seen
angrily
gazing
at
the
disturbers
of
his
haunts
beating
the
branches
with
his
fore
feet
in
expression
of
displeasure
the
rabbit
darted
across
their
path
the
jays
flew
screaming
amongst
the
foliage
the
blue
cushat
scared
at
the
clatter
of
the
horses
hoofs
sped
on
swift
wing
into
quarters
secure
from
their
approach
while
the
pies
like
curious
village
gossips
congregated
to
peer
at
the
strangers
expressing
their
astonishment
by
loud
and
continuous
chattering
though
so
gentle
of
ascent
as
to
be
almost
imperceptible
it
was
still
evident
that
the
path
they
were
pursuing
gradually
mounted
a
and
when
at
length
they
reached
an
opening
the
view
disclosed
the
eminence
they
had
insensibly
won
pausing
for
a
moment
upon
the
brow
of
the
hill
luke
pointed
to
a
stream
that
wound
through
the
valley
and
tracing
its
course
indicated
a
particular
spot
amongst
the
trees
there
was
no
appearance
of
a
dwelling
house
no
cottage
roof
no
white
canvas
shed
to
point
out
the
tents
of
the
wandering
tribe
whose
abode
they
were
seeking
the
only
circumstance
betokening
that
it
had
once
been
the
haunt
of
man
were
a
few
gray
monastic
ruins
scarce
distinguishable
from
the
stony
barrier
by
which
they
were
surrounded
and
the
sole
evidence
that
it
was
still
frequented
by
human
beings
was
a
thin
column
of
pale
blue
smoke
that
arose
in
curling
wreaths
from
out
the
brake
the
vapor
beautifully
contrasting
with
the
green
umbrage
whence
it
issued
our
destination
is
yonder
exclaimed
luke
pointing
in
the
direction
of
the
vapor
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
cried
turpin
as
well
as
to
perceive
there
is
some
one
awake
that
smoke
holds
out
a
prospect
of
breakfast
no
smoke
without
fire
as
old
lady
scanmag
said
and
i
wager
a
trifle
that
fire
was
not
lighted
for
the
fayter
fellows
to
count
their
fingers
by
we
shall
find
three
sticks
and
a
black
pot
with
a
kid
seething
in
it
i
engage
these
gipsies
have
picked
out
a
prettyish
spot
to
quarter
in
quite
picturesque
as
one
may
say
and
but
for
that
smoke
which
looks
for
all
the
world
like
a
dutch
skipper
blowing
his
morning
cloud
no
one
need
know
of
their
vicinity
a
pretty
place
upon
my
soul
the
spot
in
sooth
merited
turpin
eulogium
it
was
a
little
valley
in
the
midst
of
wooded
hills
so
secluded
that
not
a
single
habitation
appeared
in
view
clothed
with
timber
to
the
very
summits
excepting
on
the
side
where
the
party
stood
which
verged
upon
the
declivity
these
mountainous
ridges
presented
a
broken
outline
of
foliage
variegated
with
tinted
masses
of
bright
orange
timber
and
deepest
green
four
hills
hemmed
in
the
valley
here
and
there
a
gray
slab
of
rock
might
be
discerned
amongst
the
wood
and
a
figured
conspicuously
upon
a
jutting
crag
immediately
below
them
deep
sunken
in
the
ravine
and
concealed
in
part
from
view
by
the
wild
herbage
and
dwarf
shrubs
ran
a
range
of
precipitous
rocks
severed
it
would
seem
by
some
diluvial
convulsion
from
the
opposite
mountain
side
as
a
corresponding
rift
was
there
visible
in
which
the
same
dip
of
strata
might
be
observed
together
with
certain
ribbed
cavities
matching
huge
bolts
of
rock
which
had
once
locked
these
stony
walls
together
washing
this
cliff
swept
a
clear
stream
well
known
and
well
regarded
as
it
waxed
in
width
by
the
honest
brethren
of
the
angle
who
seldom
however
tracked
it
to
its
rise
amongst
these
hills
the
stream
found
its
way
into
the
valley
through
a
chasm
far
to
the
left
and
rushed
thundering
down
the
mountain
side
in
a
boiling
cascade
the
valley
was
approached
in
this
direction
from
rookwood
by
an
unfrequented
which
luke
had
from
prudential
reasons
avoided
all
seemed
consecrated
to
silence
to
solitude
to
the
hush
of
nature
yet
this
quiet
scene
was
the
chosen
retreat
of
lawless
depredators
and
had
erstwhile
been
the
theatre
of
feudal
oppression
we
have
said
that
no
habitation
was
visible
that
no
dwelling
tenanted
by
man
could
be
seen
but
following
the
spur
of
the
furthest
mountain
hill
some
traces
of
a
stone
wall
might
be
discovered
and
upon
a
natural
platform
of
rock
stood
a
stern
square
tower
which
had
once
been
the
donjon
of
the
castle
the
lords
of
which
had
called
the
four
hills
their
own
a
then
had
crowned
each
eminence
every
vestige
of
which
had
however
long
since
disappeared
sequestered
in
the
vale
stood
the
priory
before
alluded
to
a
monastery
of
gray
friars
of
the
order
of
francis
some
of
the
venerable
walls
of
which
were
still
remaining
and
if
they
had
not
reverted
to
the
bat
and
the
owl
as
is
wont
to
be
the
fate
of
such
sacred
structures
their
cloistered
shrines
were
devoted
to
beings
whose
natures
partook
in
some
measure
of
the
instincts
of
those
creatures
of
the
night
a
people
whose
deeds
were
of
darkness
and
whose
eyes
shunned
the
light
here
the
gipsies
had
pitched
their
tent
and
though
the
place
was
often
in
part
deserted
by
the
vagrant
horde
yet
certain
of
the
tribe
who
had
grown
into
years
over
whom
barbara
lovel
held
queenly
sway
made
it
their
haunt
and
were
suffered
by
the
authorities
of
the
neighborhood
to
remain
unmolested
a
lenient
piece
of
policy
which
in
our
infinite
regard
for
the
weal
of
the
tawny
tribe
we
recommend
to
the
adoption
of
all
other
justices
and
knights
of
the
shire
bidding
his
grandsire
have
regard
to
his
seat
luke
leaped
a
high
bank
and
followed
by
turpin
began
to
descend
the
hill
peter
however
took
care
to
provide
for
himself
the
descent
was
so
perilous
and
the
footing
so
insecure
that
he
chose
rather
to
trust
to
such
conveyance
as
nature
had
furnished
him
with
than
to
hazard
his
neck
by
any
false
step
of
the
horse
he
contrived
therefore
to
slide
off
from
behind
shaping
his
own
course
in
a
more
secure
direction
he
who
has
wandered
amidst
the
alps
must
have
often
had
occasion
to
witness
the
wonderful
surefootedness
of
that
mountain
pilot
the
mule
he
must
have
remarked
how
with
tenacious
hoof
he
will
claw
the
rock
and
drag
himself
from
one
impending
fragment
to
another
with
perfect
security
to
his
rider
how
he
will
breast
the
roaring
currents
of
air
and
stand
unshrinking
at
the
verge
of
almost
unfathomable
ravines
but
it
is
not
so
with
the
horse
fleet
on
the
plain
careful
over
rugged
ground
he
is
timid
and
uncertain
on
the
and
the
risk
incurred
by
luke
and
turpin
in
their
descent
of
the
almost
perpendicular
sides
of
the
cliff
was
tremendous
peter
watched
them
in
their
descent
with
some
admiration
and
with
much
contempt
he
will
break
his
neck
of
a
surety
said
he
but
what
matters
it
as
well
now
as
hereafter
so
saying
he
approached
the
verge
of
the
precipice
where
he
could
see
them
more
distinctly
the
passage
along
which
luke
rode
had
never
before
been
traversed
by
horse
hoof
cut
in
the
rock
it
presented
a
steep
zigzag
path
amongst
the
cliffs
without
any
defence
for
the
foot
traveller
except
such
as
was
afforded
by
a
casual
clinging
shrub
and
no
protection
whatever
existed
for
a
horseman
the
possibility
of
any
one
attempting
the
passage
not
having
in
all
probability
entered
into
the
calculation
of
those
who
framed
it
added
to
this
the
steps
were
of
such
unequal
heights
and
withal
so
narrow
that
the
danger
was
proportionately
increased
ten
thousand
devils
cried
turpin
staring
downwards
is
this
the
best
road
you
have
got
you
will
find
one
more
easy
replied
luke
if
you
ride
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
down
the
wood
and
then
return
by
the
brook
side
you
will
meet
me
at
the
priory
no
answered
the
highwayman
boldly
if
you
go
i
go
too
it
shall
never
be
said
that
dick
turpin
was
afraid
to
follow
where
another
would
lead
proceed
luke
gave
his
horse
the
bridle
and
the
animal
slowly
and
steadily
commenced
the
descent
fixing
his
fore
legs
upon
the
steps
and
drawing
his
hinder
limbs
carefully
after
him
here
it
was
that
the
lightness
and
steadiness
of
turpin
mare
was
completely
shown
no
alpine
mule
could
have
borne
its
rider
with
more
apparent
ease
and
safety
turpin
encouraged
her
by
hand
and
word
but
she
needed
it
not
the
sexton
saw
them
and
tracking
their
giddy
descent
he
became
more
interested
than
he
anticipated
his
attention
was
suddenly
drawn
towards
luke
he
is
gone
cried
peter
he
falls
he
sinks
my
plans
are
all
defeated
the
last
link
is
snapped
no
added
he
recovering
his
wonted
composure
his
end
is
not
so
fated
rook
had
missed
his
footing
he
rolled
stumbling
down
the
precipice
a
few
yards
luke
fate
seemed
inevitable
his
feet
were
entangled
in
the
stirrup
he
could
not
free
himself
a
birch
tree
growing
in
a
chink
of
the
precipice
arrested
his
further
fall
but
for
this
timely
aid
all
had
been
over
here
luke
was
enabled
to
extricate
himself
from
the
stirrup
and
to
regain
his
feet
seizing
the
bridle
he
dragged
his
faulty
steed
back
again
to
the
road
you
have
had
a
narrow
escape
by
jove
said
turpin
who
had
been
thunderstruck
with
the
whole
proceeding
those
big
cattle
are
always
clumsy
devilish
lucky
it
no
worse
it
was
now
comparatively
smooth
travelling
but
they
had
not
as
yet
reached
the
valley
and
it
seemed
to
be
luke
object
to
take
a
circuitous
path
this
was
so
evident
that
turpin
could
not
help
commenting
upon
it
luke
evaded
the
question
the
crag
is
steep
there
said
he
besides
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
want
to
surprise
them
ho
ho
laughed
dick
surprise
them
eh
what
a
pity
the
birch
tree
was
in
the
way
you
would
have
done
it
properly
then
egad
another
surprise
dick
last
exclamation
was
caused
by
his
having
suddenly
come
upon
a
wide
gully
in
the
rock
through
which
dashed
a
headlong
torrent
crossed
by
a
single
plank
you
must
be
mad
to
have
taken
this
road
cried
turpin
gazing
down
into
the
roaring
depths
in
which
the
waterfall
raged
and
measuring
the
distance
of
the
pass
with
his
eye
so
so
bess
ay
look
at
it
wench
curse
me
luke
if
i
think
your
horse
will
do
it
and
therefore
turn
him
loose
but
dick
might
as
well
have
bidden
the
cataract
to
flow
backwards
luke
struck
his
heels
into
his
horse
sides
the
steed
galloped
to
the
brink
snorted
and
refused
the
leap
i
told
you
so
he
ca
do
it
said
turpin
well
if
you
are
obstinate
a
wilful
man
must
have
his
way
stand
aside
while
i
try
it
for
you
patting
bess
he
put
her
to
a
gallop
she
cleared
the
gulf
bravely
landing
her
rider
safely
upon
the
opposite
rock
now
then
cried
turpin
from
the
other
side
of
the
chasm
luke
again
urged
his
steed
encouraged
by
what
he
had
seen
this
time
the
horse
sprang
across
without
hesitation
the
next
instant
they
were
in
the
valley
for
some
time
they
rode
along
the
banks
of
the
stream
in
silence
a
sound
at
length
caught
the
quick
ears
of
the
highwayman
hist
cried
he
some
one
sings
do
you
hear
it
i
do
replied
luke
the
blood
rushing
to
his
cheeks
and
could
give
a
guess
at
the
singer
no
doubt
said
turpin
with
a
knowing
look
was
it
to
hear
yon
woodlark
that
you
nearly
broke
your
own
neck
and
put
mine
in
jeopardy
prithee
be
silent
whispered
luke
i
am
dumb
replied
turpin
i
like
a
sweet
voice
as
well
as
another
clear
as
the
note
of
a
bird
yet
melancholy
as
the
distant
dole
of
a
arose
the
sound
of
that
sweet
voice
from
the
wood
a
fragment
of
a
spanish
gipsy
song
it
warbled
luke
knew
it
well
thus
ran
the
romance
la
gitanilla
by
the
guadalquivir
ere
the
sun
be
flown
by
that
glorious
river
sits
a
maid
alone
like
the
sunset
splendor
of
that
current
bright
shone
her
dark
eyes
tender
as
its
witching
light
like
the
ripple
flowing
tinged
with
purple
sheen
darkly
richly
glowing
is
her
warm
cheek
seen
is
the
gitanilla
by
the
stream
doth
linger
in
the
hope
that
eve
will
her
lover
bring
her
see
the
sun
is
sinking
all
grows
dim
and
dies
see
the
waves
are
drinking
glories
of
the
skies
day
last
lustre
playeth
on
that
current
dark
yet
no
speck
betrayeth
his
long
bark
is
the
hour
of
meeting
nay
the
hour
is
past
swift
the
time
is
fleeting
fleeteth
hope
as
fast
still
the
gitanilla
by
the
stream
doth
linger
in
the
hope
that
night
will
her
lover
bring
her
the
tender
trembling
of
a
guitar
was
heard
in
accompaniment
of
the
ravishing
melodist
the
song
ceased
where
is
the
bird
asked
turpin
move
on
in
silence
and
you
shall
see
said
luke
and
keeping
upon
the
turf
so
that
his
horse
tread
became
inaudible
he
presently
arrived
at
a
spot
where
through
the
boughs
the
object
of
his
investigation
could
plainly
be
distinguished
though
he
himself
was
concealed
from
view
upon
a
platform
of
rock
rising
to
the
height
of
the
trees
nearly
perpendicularly
from
the
river
bed
appeared
the
figure
of
the
gipsy
maid
her
footstep
rested
on
the
extreme
edge
of
the
abrupt
cliff
at
whose
base
the
water
boiled
in
a
deep
whirlpool
and
the
bounding
chamois
could
not
have
been
more
lightly
poised
one
small
hand
rested
upon
her
guitar
the
other
pressed
her
brow
braided
hair
of
the
jettiest
dye
and
sleekest
texture
was
twined
around
her
brow
in
endless
twisted
folds
rowled
it
was
in
many
a
curious
fret
much
like
a
rich
and
curious
coronet
upon
whose
arches
twenty
cupids
lay
and
were
as
tied
or
loth
to
fly
away
and
so
exuberant
was
this
rarest
feminine
ornament
that
after
encompassing
her
brow
it
was
passed
behind
and
hung
down
in
long
thick
plaits
almost
to
her
feet
sparkling
as
the
sunbeams
that
played
upon
her
dark
yet
radiant
features
were
the
large
black
oriental
eyes
of
the
maiden
and
shaded
with
lashes
long
and
silken
hers
was
a
moorish
countenance
in
which
the
magnificence
of
the
eyes
eclipses
the
face
be
it
ever
so
beautiful
an
effect
to
be
observed
in
the
angelic
pictures
of
murillo
and
the
lovely
contour
is
scarcely
noticed
in
the
gaze
which
those
long
languid
luminous
orbs
attract
sybil
features
were
exquisite
yet
you
looked
only
at
her
eyes
they
were
the
loadstars
of
her
countenance
her
costume
was
singular
and
partook
like
herself
of
other
climes
like
the
andalusian
dame
her
choice
of
color
inclined
towards
black
as
the
material
of
most
of
her
dress
was
of
that
sombre
hue
a
bodice
of
embroidered
velvet
restrained
her
delicate
swell
a
rich
girdle
from
which
depended
a
silver
chain
sustaining
a
short
poniard
bound
her
waist
around
her
slender
throat
was
twined
a
costly
kerchief
and
the
rest
of
her
dress
was
calculated
to
display
her
slight
yet
faultless
figure
to
the
fullest
advantage
unconscious
that
she
was
the
object
of
regard
she
raised
her
guitar
and
essayed
to
touch
the
chords
she
struck
a
few
notes
and
resumed
her
romance
swift
that
stream
flows
on
swift
the
night
is
wearing
yet
she
is
not
gone
though
with
heart
despairing
her
song
died
away
her
hand
was
needed
to
brush
off
the
tears
that
were
gathering
in
her
large
dark
eyes
at
once
her
attitude
was
changed
the
hare
could
not
have
started
more
suddenly
from
her
form
she
heard
accents
well
known
concluding
the
melody
dips
an
hark
gently
on
the
river
is
her
lover
bark
on
the
guadalquivir
hark
a
song
she
hears
every
note
she
snatches
as
the
singer
nears
her
own
name
she
catches
now
the
gitanilla
stays
not
by
the
water
for
the
midnight
hour
hath
her
lover
brought
her
it
was
her
lover
voice
she
caught
the
sound
at
once
and
starting
as
the
roe
would
arouse
herself
at
the
hunter
approach
bounded
down
the
crag
and
ere
he
had
finished
the
refrain
was
by
his
side
flinging
the
bridle
to
turpin
luke
sprang
to
her
and
caught
her
in
his
arms
disengaging
herself
from
his
ardent
embrace
sybil
drew
back
abashed
at
the
sight
of
the
highwayman
heed
him
not
said
luke
it
is
a
friend
he
is
welcome
here
then
replied
sybil
but
where
have
you
tarried
so
long
dear
luke
continued
she
as
they
walked
to
a
little
distance
from
the
highwayman
what
hath
detained
you
the
hours
have
passed
wearily
since
you
departed
you
bring
good
news
good
news
my
girl
so
good
that
i
falter
even
in
the
telling
of
it
you
shall
know
all
anon
and
see
our
friend
yonder
grows
impatient
are
there
any
stirring
we
must
bestow
a
meal
upon
him
and
that
forthwith
he
is
one
of
those
who
brook
not
much
delay
i
came
not
to
spoil
a
love
meeting
said
turpin
who
had
witnessed
the
scene
but
in
sober
seriousness
if
there
is
a
stray
capon
to
be
met
with
in
the
land
of
egypt
i
shall
be
glad
to
make
his
acquaintance
methinks
i
scent
a
stew
afar
off
follow
me
said
sybil
your
wants
shall
be
supplied
stay
said
luke
there
is
one
other
of
our
party
whose
coming
we
must
abide
he
is
here
said
sybil
observing
the
sexton
at
a
distance
who
is
that
old
man
my
grandsire
peter
bradley
is
that
peter
bradley
asked
sybil
ay
you
may
well
ask
whether
that
old
who
ought
to
grin
in
a
glass
case
for
folks
to
stare
at
be
kith
and
kin
of
such
a
cove
as
your
fancy
man
luke
said
turpin
laughing
but
faith
he
is
though
he
is
your
grandsire
luke
said
sybil
i
like
him
not
his
glance
resembles
that
of
the
evil
eye
and
in
fact
the
look
which
peter
fixed
upon
her
was
such
as
the
rattlesnake
casts
upon
its
victim
and
sybil
felt
like
a
poor
fluttering
bird
under
the
fascination
of
that
venomous
reptile
she
could
not
remove
her
eyes
from
his
though
she
trembled
as
she
gazed
we
have
said
that
peter
orbs
were
like
those
of
the
toad
age
had
not
dimmed
their
brilliancy
in
his
harsh
features
you
could
only
read
bitter
scorn
or
withering
hate
but
in
his
eyes
resided
a
magnetic
influence
of
attraction
or
repulsion
sybil
underwent
the
former
feeling
in
a
disagreeable
degree
she
was
drawn
to
him
as
by
the
motion
of
a
whirlpool
and
involuntarily
clung
to
her
lover
it
is
the
evil
eye
dear
luke
tut
tut
dear
sybil
i
tell
you
it
is
my
grandsire
the
girl
says
rightly
however
rejoined
turpin
peter
has
a
confounded
ugly
look
about
the
ogles
and
stares
enough
to
put
a
modest
wench
out
of
countenance
come
come
my
old
earthworm
crawl
along
we
have
waited
for
you
long
enough
is
this
the
first
time
you
have
seen
a
pretty
lass
eh
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
seen
one
so
beautiful
said
peter
and
i
crave
her
pardon
if
my
freedom
has
offended
her
i
wonder
not
at
your
enchantment
grandson
luke
now
i
behold
the
object
of
it
but
there
is
one
piece
of
counsel
i
would
give
to
this
fair
maid
the
next
time
she
trusts
you
from
her
sight
i
would
advise
her
to
await
you
at
the
otherwise
the
chances
are
shrewdly
against
your
reaching
the
ground
with
neck
unbroken
there
was
something
notwithstanding
the
satirical
manner
in
which
peter
delivered
this
speech
calculated
to
make
a
more
favorable
impression
upon
sybil
than
his
previous
conduct
had
inspired
her
with
and
having
ascertained
from
luke
to
what
his
speech
referred
she
extended
her
hand
to
him
yet
not
without
a
shudder
as
it
was
enclosed
in
his
skinny
grasp
it
was
like
the
fingers
of
venus
in
the
grasp
of
a
skeleton
this
is
a
little
hand
said
peter
and
i
have
some
skill
myself
in
palmistry
shall
i
peruse
its
lines
not
now
in
the
devil
name
said
turpin
stamping
impatiently
we
shall
have
old
ruffin
himself
amongst
us
presently
if
peter
bradley
grows
gallant
leading
their
horses
the
party
took
their
way
through
the
trees
a
few
minutes
walking
brought
them
in
sight
of
the
gipsy
encampment
the
spot
selected
for
which
might
be
termed
the
eden
of
the
valley
it
was
a
small
green
plain
smooth
as
a
lawn
kept
ever
verdant
save
in
the
spots
where
the
frequent
fires
had
scorched
its
surface
by
the
flowing
stream
that
rushed
past
it
and
surrounded
by
an
amphitheatre
of
wooded
hills
here
might
be
seen
the
canvas
tent
with
its
patches
of
varied
coloring
the
hut
of
primitive
construction
the
kettle
slung
between
two
poles

other
movables
and
immovables
belonging
to
the
wandering
tribe
glimmering
through
the
trees
at
the
extremity
of
the
plain
appeared
the
walls
of
davenham
priory
though
much
had
gone
to
decay
enough
remained
to
recall
the
pristine
state
of
this
once
majestic
pile
and
the
long
though
broken
line
of
saxon
arches
that
still
marked
the
cloister
wall
the
piers
that
yet
supported
the
dormitory
the
enormous
arch
that
spanned
the
court
and
above
all
the
great
marigold
or
circular
window
which
terminated
the
chapel
and
which
though
now
despoiled
of
its
painted
honors
retained
like
the
skeleton
leaf
its
fibrous
intricacies
entire
all
eloquently
spoke
of
the
glories
of
the
past
while
they
awakened
reverence
and
admiration
for
the
still
enduring
beauty
of
the
present
towards
these
ruins
sybil
conducted
the
party
do
you
dwell
therein
asked
peter
pointing
towards
the
priory
that
is
my
dwelling
said
sybil
it
is
one
i
should
covet
more
than
a
modern
mansion
returned
the
sexton
i
love
those
old
walls
better
than
any
house
that
was
ever
fashioned
replied
sybil
as
they
entered
the
prior
close
as
it
was
called
several
swarthy
figures
made
their
appearance
from
the
tents
many
a
greeting
was
bestowed
upon
luke
in
the
wild
jargon
of
the
tribe
at
length
an
uncouth
dwarfish
figure
with
a
shock
head
of
black
hair
hopped
towards
them
he
seemed
to
acknowledge
luke
as
his
master
what
ho
grasshopper
said
luke
take
these
horses
and
see
that
they
lack
neither
dressing
nor
provender
and
hark
ye
grasshopper
added
turpin
i
give
you
a
special
charge
about
this
mare
neither
dress
nor
feed
her
till
i
see
both
done
myself
just
walk
her
for
ten
minutes
and
if
you
have
a
glass
of
ale
in
the
place
let
her
sip
it
your
bidding
shall
be
done
chirped
the
human
insect
as
he
fluttered
away
with
his
charges
a
motley
assemblage
of
varlets
women
and
children
whose
dusky
limbs
betrayed
their
lineage
in
strange
costume
and
of
wild
deportment
checked
the
path
muttering
welcome
upon
welcome
into
the
ear
of
luke
as
he
passed
as
it
was
evident
he
was
in
no
mood
for
converse
sybil
who
seemed
to
exercise
considerable
authority
over
the
crew
with
a
word
dispersed
them
and
they
herded
back
to
their
respective
habitations
a
low
door
admitted
luke
and
his
companions
into
what
had
once
been
the
garden
in
which
some
old
apple
and
were
still
standing
bearing
a
look
of
antiquity
almost
as
venerable
as
that
of
the
adjoining
fabric
another
open
door
gave
them
entrance
to
a
spacious
chamber
formerly
the
or
refectory
of
the
holy
brotherhood
and
a
goodly
room
it
had
been
though
now
its
slender
lanceolated
windows
were
stuffed
with
hay
to
keep
out
the
air
large
holes
told
where
huge
oaken
rafters
had
once
crossed
the
roof
and
a
yawning
aperture
marked
the
place
where
a
cheering
fire
had
formerly
blazed
as
regarded
this
latter
spot
the
good
old
custom
was
not
even
now
totally
abrogated
an
iron
plate
covered
with
crackling
wood
sustained
a
ponderous
black
caldron
the
rich
steam
from
which
gratefully
affected
the
olfactory
organs
of
the
highwayman
that
augurs
well
said
he
rubbing
his
hands
still
hungering
after
the
fleshpots
of
egypt
said
the
sexton
with
a
ghastly
smile
we
will
see
what
that
kettle
contains
said
luke
handassah
grace
exclaimed
sybil
calling
her
summons
was
answered
by
two
maidens
habited
not
unbecomingly
in
gipsy
gear
bring
the
best
our
larder
can
furnish
said
sybil
and
use
despatch
you
have
appetites
to
provide
for
sharpened
by
a
long
ride
in
the
open
air
and
by
a
night
fasting
said
luke
and
solitary
confinement
to
boot
and
a
night
of
business
added
turpin
and
plaguy
perplexing
business
into
the
bargain
and
the
night
of
a
funeral
too
doled
peter
and
that
funeral
a
father
let
us
have
breakfast
speedily
by
all
means
we
have
rare
appetites
an
old
oaken
table
it
might
have
been
the
upon
which
the
holy
friars
had
broken
their
morning
fast
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
the
ample
board
soon
groaned
beneath
the
weight
of
the
savory
caldron
the
unctuous
contents
of
which
proved
to
be
a
couple
of
dismembered
pheasants
an
equal
proportion
of
poultry
great
gouts
of
ham
mushrooms
onions
and
other
piquant
condiments
so
satisfactory
to
dick
turpin
that
upon
tasting
a
mouthful
he
absolutely
shed
tears
of
delight
the
dish
was
indeed
the
triumph
of
gipsy
cookery
and
so
sedulously
did
dick
apply
himself
to
his
mess
and
so
complete
was
his
abstraction
that
he
perceived
not
he
was
left
alone
it
was
only
when
about
to
wash
down
the
last
drumstick
of
the
last
fowl
with
a
can
of
excellent
ale
that
he
made
this
discovery
what
all
gone
and
peter
bradley
too
what
the
devil
does
this
mean
mused
he
i
must
not
muddle
my
brain
with
any
more
pharaoh
though
i
have
feasted
like
a
king
of
egypt
that
will
never
do
caution
dick
caution
suppose
i
shift
yon
brick
from
the
wall
and
place
this
precious
document
beneath
it
pshaw
luke
would
never
play
me
false
and
now
for
bess
bless
her
black
skin
she
wonder
where
i
been
so
long
it
not
my
way
to
leave
her
to
shift
for
herself
though
she
can
do
that
on
a
pinch
soliloquizing
thus
he
arose
and
walked
towards
the
door
the
wiving
vine
that
round
the
friendly
elm
twines
her
soft
limbs
and
weaves
a
leafy
mantle
for
her
supporting
lover
dares
not
venture
to
mix
her
humble
boughs
with
the
embraces
of
the
more
lofty
cedar
glapthorne
beneath
a
moldering
wall
whither
they
had
strayed
to
be
free
from
interruption
and
upon
a
carpet
of
the
greenest
moss
sat
sybil
and
her
lover
with
eager
curiosity
she
listened
to
his
tale
he
recounted
all
that
had
befallen
him
since
his
departure
he
told
her
of
the
awful
revelations
of
the
tomb
of
the
ring
that
like
a
talisman
had
conjured
up
a
thousand
brilliant
prospects
of
his
subsequent
perils
his
escapes
his
rencontre
with
lady
rookwood
his
visit
to
his
father
body
and
his
meeting
with
his
brother
all
this
she
heard
with
a
cheek
now
flushed
with
expectation
now
made
pale
with
apprehension
with
palpitating
bosom
and
suppressed
breath
but
when
taking
a
softer
tone
love
affection
happiness
inspired
the
theme
and
luke
sought
to
paint
the
bliss
that
should
be
theirs
in
his
new
estate
when
he
would
throw
his
fortune
into
her
lap
his
titles
at
her
feet
and
bid
her
wear
them
with
him
when
with
ennobled
hand
and
unchanged
heart
he
would
fulfil
the
troth
plighted
in
his
outcast
days
in
lieu
of
tender
grateful
acquiescence
the
features
of
sybil
became
overcast
the
soft
smile
faded
away
and
as
spring
sunshine
is
succeeded
by
the
sudden
shower
the
light
that
dwelt
in
her
sunny
orbs
grew
dim
with
tears
why
why
is
this
dear
sybil
said
luke
gazing
upon
her
in
astonishment
not
unmingled
with
displeasure
to
what
am
i
to
attribute
these
tears
you
do
not
surely
regret
my
good
fortune
not
on
your
own
account
dear
luke
returned
she
sadly
the
tears
i
shed
were
for
myself
the
first
the
only
tears
that
i
have
ever
shed
for
such
cause
and
added
she
raising
her
head
like
a
flower
surcharged
with
moisture
they
shall
be
the
last
this
is
inexplicable
dear
sybil
why
should
you
lament
for
yourself
if
not
for
me
does
not
the
sunshine
of
prosperity
that
now
shines
upon
me
gild
you
with
the
same
beam
did
i
not
even
now
affirm
that
the
day
that
saw
me
enter
the
hall
of
my
forefathers
should
dawn
upon
our
espousals
true
but
the
sun
that
shines
upon
you
to
me
wears
a
threatening
aspect
the
day
of
those
espousals
will
never
dawn
you
can
not
make
me
the
lady
of
rookwood
what
do
i
hear
exclaimed
luke
surprised
at
this
avowal
of
his
mistress
sadly
and
deliberately
delivered
not
wed
you
and
wherefore
not
is
it
the
rank
i
have
acquired
or
hope
to
acquire
that
displeases
you
speak
that
i
may
waste
no
further
time
in
thus
pursuing
the
shadows
of
happiness
while
the
reality
fleets
from
me
and
they
shadows
and
this
the
reality
dear
luke
question
your
secret
soul
and
you
will
find
it
otherwise
you
could
not
forego
your
triumph
it
is
not
likely
you
have
dwelt
too
much
upon
the
proud
title
which
will
be
yours
to
yield
it
to
another
when
it
may
be
won
so
easily
and
above
all
when
your
mother
reputation
and
your
own
stained
name
may
be
cleared
by
one
word
breathed
aloud
would
you
fail
to
utter
it
no
dear
luke
i
read
your
heart
you
would
not
and
if
i
could
forego
this
wherefore
is
it
that
you
refuse
to
be
a
sharer
in
my
triumph
why
will
you
render
my
honors
valueless
when
i
have
acquired
them
you
love
me
not
not
love
you
luke
approve
it
then
i
do
approve
it
bear
witness
the
sacrifice
i
am
about
to
make
of
all
my
hopes
at
the
shrine
of
my
idolatry
to
you
bear
witness
the
agony
of
this
hour
bear
witness
the
horror
of
the
avowal
that
i
never
can
be
yours
as
luke
bradley
i
would
joyfully
oh
how
joyfully
have
been
your
bride
as
sir
luke
rookwood
and
she
shuddered
as
she
pronounced
the
name
i
never
can
be
so
then
by
heaven
luke
bradley
will
i
remain
but
wherefore
wherefore
not
as
sir
luke
rookwood
because
replied
sybil
with
reluctance
because
i
am
no
longer
your
equal
the
gipsy
daughter
is
no
mate
for
sir
luke
rookwood
love
can
not
blind
me
dear
luke
it
can
not
make
me
other
than
i
am
it
can
not
exalt
me
in
my
own
esteem
nor
in
that
of
the
world
with
which
you
alas
too
soon
will
mingle
and
which
will
regard
even
me
as
no
matter
what
it
shall
not
scorn
me
as
your
bride
i
will
not
bring
shame
and
reproach
upon
you
oh
if
for
me
dear
luke
the
proud
ones
of
the
earth
were
to
treat
you
with
contumely
this
heart
would
break
with
agony
for
myself
i
have
pride
sufficient
perchance
too
much
perchance
is
pride
that
actuates
me
now
i
know
not
but
for
you
i
am
all
weakness
as
you
were
heretofore
i
would
have
been
to
you
the
tenderest
and
truest
wife
that
ever
breathed
as
you
are
now
hear
me
sybil
hear
out
dear
luke
one
other
motive
there
is
that
determines
my
present
conduct
which
were
all
else
surmounted
would
in
itself
suffice
ask
me
not
what
that
is
i
can
not
explain
it
for
your
own
sake
i
implore
you
be
satisfied
with
my
refusal
what
a
destiny
is
mine
exclaimed
luke
striking
his
forehead
with
his
clenched
hand
no
choice
is
left
me
either
way
i
destroy
my
own
happiness
on
the
one
hand
stands
love
on
the
other
ambition
yet
neither
will
conjoin
pursue
then
ambition
said
sybil
energetically
if
you
hesitate
forget
that
i
have
ever
existed
forget
you
have
ever
loved
forget
that
such
a
passion
dwells
within
the
human
heart
and
you
may
still
be
happy
though
you
are
great
and
do
you
deem
replied
luke
with
frantic
impatience
that
i
accomplish
this
that
i
forget
that
i
have
loved
you
that
i
forget
you
cost
what
it
will
the
effort
shall
be
made
yet
by
our
former
love
i
charge
you
tell
me
what
has
wrought
this
change
in
you
why
do
you
refuse
me
i
have
said
you
are
sir
luke
rookwood
returned
sybil
with
painful
emotion
does
that
name
import
nothing
imports
it
aught
of
ill
to
me
everything
of
ill
it
is
a
fated
house
its
line
are
all
predestined
to
what
demanded
luke
to
replied
sybil
with
solemn
emphasis
to
the
murder
of
their
wives
forgive
me
luke
if
i
have
dared
to
utter
this
yourself
compelled
me
to
it
amazement
horror
wrath
kept
luke
silent
for
a
few
moments
starting
to
his
feet
he
cried
and
can
you
suspect
me
of
a
crime
so
foul
think
you
because
i
shall
assume
the
name
that
i
shall
put
on
the
nature
likewise
of
my
race
do
you
believe
me
capable
of
aught
so
horrible
oh
no
i
believe
it
not
i
am
sure
you
would
not
do
it
your
soul
would
reject
with
horror
such
a
deed
but
if
fate
should
guide
your
hand
if
the
avenging
spirit
of
your
murdered
ancestress
should
point
to
the
steel
you
could
not
shun
it
then
in
heaven
name
to
what
do
you
allude
to
a
tradition
of
your
house
replied
sybil
listen
to
me
and
you
shall
hear
the
legend
and
with
a
pathos
that
produced
a
thrilling
effect
upon
luke
she
sang
the
following
ballad
the
legend
of
the
lady
of
rookwood
grim
ranulph
home
hath
at
midnight
come
from
the
long
wars
of
the
roses
and
the
squire
who
waits
at
his
ancient
gates
a
secret
dark
discloses
to
that
varlet
words
no
response
accords
his
lord
but
his
visage
stern
grows
ghastly
white
in
the
wan
moonlight
and
his
eyes
like
the
lean
wolf
burn
to
his
lady
bower
at
that
lonesome
hour
unannounced
is
sir
ranulph
gone
through
the
dim
corridor
through
the
hidden
door
he
glides
she
is
all
alone
full
of
holy
zeal
doth
his
young
dame
kneel
at
the
meek
madonna
feet
her
hands
are
pressed
on
her
gentle
breast
and
upturned
is
her
aspect
sweet
beats
ranulph
heart
with
a
joyful
start
as
he
looks
on
her
guiltless
face
and
the
raging
fire
of
his
jealous
ire
is
subdued
by
the
words
of
grace
his
own
name
shares
her
murmured
prayers
more
freely
can
he
breathe
but
ah
that
look
why
doth
he
pluck
his
poniard
from
its
sheath
on
a
footstool
thrown
lies
a
costly
gown
of
saye
and
of
minevere
a
mantle
fair
for
the
dainty
wear
of
a
migniard
cavalier
and
on
it
flung
to
a
bracelet
hung
a
picture
meets
his
eye
by
my
father
head
grim
ranulph
said
false
wife
thy
end
draws
nigh
from
off
its
chain
hath
the
fierce
knight
that
fond
and
fatal
pledge
his
dark
eyes
blaze
no
word
he
says
thrice
gleams
his
dagger
edge
her
blood
it
drinks
and
as
she
sinks
his
victim
hears
his
cry
for
kiss
impure
of
paramour
dost
thou
die
silent
he
stood
with
hands
embrued
in
gore
and
glance
of
flame
as
thus
her
plaint
in
accents
faint
made
his
dame
kind
heaven
can
tell
that
all
too
well
i
loved
thee
cruel
lord
but
now
with
hate
commensurate
assassin
abhorred
i
loved
thee
long
through
doubt
and
wrong
i
loved
thee
and
no
other
and
my
love
was
pure
for
my
paramour
for
alas
he
was
my
brother
the
red
red
rose
on
banner
glows
on
pennon
gleams
the
white
and
the
bitter
feud
that
ye
both
have
rued
forbids
ye
to
unite
my
bower
he
sought
what
time
he
thought
thy
jealous
vassals
slept
of
joy
we
dreamed
and
never
deemed
that
watch
those
vassals
kept
an
hour
flew
by
too
speedily
that
picture
was
his
boon
ah
little
thrift
to
me
that
gift
he
left
me
all
too
soon
wo
worth
the
hour
dark
fates
did
lower
when
our
hands
were
first
united
for
my
heart
firm
truth
tears
and
ruth
with
death
hast
thou
requited
in
prayer
sincere
full
many
a
year
of
my
wretched
life
i
spent
but
to
hell
control
would
i
give
my
soul
to
work
thy
chastisement
these
wild
words
said
low
drooped
her
head
and
froze
for
the
earth
did
gape
as
an
awful
shape
from
out
its
depths
arose
thy
prayer
is

hell
hath
concurred
cried
the
fiend
thy
soul
is
mine
like
fate
may
dread
each
dame
shall
wed
with
ranulph
or
his
line
within
the
tomb
to
await
her
doom
is
that
hapless
lady
sleeping
and
another
bride
by
ranulph
side
through
the
livelong
night
is
weeping
dame
declines
a
third
repines
and
fades
like
the
rest
away
her
lot
she
rues
whom
a
rookwood
woos
is
her
wedding
and
this
is
the
legend
of
my
ancestress
said
luke
as
sybil
strains
were
ended
it
is
replied
she
an
idle
tale
observed
luke
moodily
not
so
answered
sybil
has
not
the
curse
of
blood
clung
to
all
your
line
has
it
not
attached
to
your
father
to
sir
reginald
sir
ralph
sir
ranulph
to
all
which
of
them
has
escaped
it
and
when
i
tell
you
this
dear
luke
when
i
find
you
bear
the
name
of
this
accursed
race
can
you
wonder
if
i
shudder
at
adding
to
the
list
of
the
victims
of
that
ruthless
spirit
and
that
i
tremble
for
you
i
would
die
you
willingly
but
not
by
your
hand
i
would
not
that
my
blood
which
i
would
now
pour
out
for
you
as
freely
as
water
should
rise
up
in
judgment
against
you
for
myself
i
have
no
tears
for
a
thousand
my
mother
upon
her
told
me
i
should
never
be
yours
i
believed
her
not
for
i
was
happy
then
she
said
that
we
never
should
be
united
or
if
united
what
in
heaven
name
that
you
would
be
my
destroyer
how
could
i
credit
her
words
then
how
can
i
doubt
them
now
when
i
find
you
are
a
rookwood
and
think
not
dear
luke
that
i
am
ruled
by
selfish
fears
in
this
resolution
to
renounce
you
may
cost
me
my
life
but
the
deed
will
be
my
own
you
may
call
me
superstitious
credulous
i
have
been
nurtured
in
credulity
it
is
the
faith
of
my
fathers
there
are
those
methinks
who
have
an
insight
into
futurity
and
such
boding
words
have
been
spoken
that
be
they
true
or
false
i
will
not
risk
their
fulfilment
in
my
person
i
may
be
credulous
i
may
be
weak
i
may
be
erring
but
i
am
steadfast
in
this
bid
me
perish
at
your
feet
and
i
will
do
it
i
will
not
be
your
fate
i
will
not
be
the
wretched
instrument
of
your
perdition
i
will
love
worship
watch
serve
perish
for
you
but
i
not
wed
you
exhausted
by
the
vehemence
of
her
emotion
she
would
have
sunk
upon
the
ground
had
not
luke
caught
her
in
his
arms
pressing
her
to
his
bosom
he
renewed
his
passionate
protestations
every
argument
was
unavailing
sybil
appeared
inflexible
you
love
me
as
you
have
ever
loved
me
said
she
at
length
a
more
fervently
replied
luke
put
it
to
the
test
how
if
i
dare
to
do
so
consider
well
i
may
ask
too
much
name
it
if
it
be
not
to
surrender
you
by
my
mother
body
i
will
obey
you
i
would
propose
an
oath
ha
a
solemn
binding
oath
that
if
you
wed
me
not
you
will
not
wed
another
ha
do
you
start
have
i
appalled
you
i
start
i
will
take
it
hear
me
by
hold
exclaimed
a
voice
behind
them
do
not
forswear
yourself
and
immediately
afterwards
the
sexton
made
his
appearance
there
was
a
malignant
smile
upon
his
countenance
the
lovers
started
at
the
ominous
interruption
begone
cried
luke
take
not
that
oath
said
peter
and
i
leave
you
remember
the
counsel
i
gave
you
on
our
way
hither
what
counsel
did
he
give
you
luke
inquired
sybil
eagerly
of
her
lover
we
spoke
of
you
fond
girl
replied
peter
i
cautioned
him
against
the
match
i
knew
not
your
sentiments
or
i
had
spared
myself
the
trouble
you
have
judged
wisely
were
he
to
wed
you
ill
would
come
of
it
but
he
wed
another
must
cried
sybil
her
eyes
absolutely
emitting
sparkles
of
indignation
from
their
depths
and
unsheathing
as
she
spoke
the
short
poniard
which
she
wore
at
her
girdle
she
rushed
towards
peter
raising
her
hand
to
strike
wed
another
and
dare
you
counsel
this
put
up
your
dagger
fair
maiden
said
peter
calmly
had
i
been
younger
your
eyes
might
have
had
more
terrors
for
me
than
your
weapon
as
it
is
i
am
proof
against
both
you
would
not
strike
an
old
man
like
myself
and
of
your
lover
kin
sybil
uplifted
hand
fell
to
her
side
is
true
continued
the
sexton
i
dared
to
give
him
this
advice
and
when
you
have
heard
me
out
you
will
not
i
am
persuaded
think
me
so
unreasonable
as
at
first
i
may
appear
to
be
i
have
been
an
unseen
listener
to
your
converse
not
that
i
desire
to
pry
into
your
secrets
far
from
it
i
overheard
you
by
accident
i
applaud
your
resolution
but
if
you
are
inclined
to
sacrifice
all
for
your
weal
do
not
let
the
work
be
incomplete
bind
him
not
by
oaths
which
he
will
regard
as
spiders
webs
to
be
burst
through
at
pleasure
you
see
as
well
as
i
do
that
he
is
bent
on
being
lord
of
rookwood
and
in
truth
to
an
aspiring
mind
such
a
desire
is
natural
is
praiseworthy
it
will
be
pleasant
as
well
as
honorable
to
efface
the
stain
cast
upon
his
birth
it
will
be
an
act
of
filial
duty
in
him
to
restore
his
mother
good
name
and
i
her
father
laud
his
anxiety
on
that
score
though
to
speak
truth
fair
maid
i
am
not
so
rigid
as
your
nice
moralists
in
my
view
of
human
nature
and
can
allow
a
latitude
to
love
which
their
nicer
scruples
will
not
admit
it
will
be
a
proud
thing
to
triumph
over
his
implacable
foe
and
this
he
may
accomplish
without
marriage
interrupted
sybil
angrily
true
returned
peter
yet
not
maintain
it
may
win
it
but
not
wear
it
you
have
said
truly
the
house
of
rookwood
is
a
fated
house
and
it
hath
been
said
likewise
that
if
he
wed
not
one
of
his
own
kindred
that
if
rook
mate
not
with
rook
his
possessions
shall
pass
away
from
his
hands
listen
to
this
prophetic
quatrain
when
the
stray
rook
shall
perch
on
the
topmost
bough
there
shall
be
clamor
and
screeching
i
trow
but
of
right
to
and
rule
of
the
ancient
nest
the
rook
that
with
rook
mates
shall
hold
him
possest
you
hear
what
these
quaint
rhymes
say
luke
is
doubtless
the
stray
rook
and
a
fledgeling
hath
flown
hither
from
a
distant
country
he
must
take
her
to
his
mate
or
relinquish
her
and
ancient
nest
to
his
brother
for
my
own
part
i
disregard
such
sayings
i
have
little
faith
in
prophecy
and
divination
i
know
not
what
eleanor
mowbray
for
so
she
is
called
can
have
to
do
with
the
tenure
of
the
estates
of
rookwood
but
if
luke
rookwood
after
he
has
lorded
it
for
awhile
in
splendor
be
cast
forth
again
in
rags
and
wretchedness
let
him
not
blame
his
grandsire
for
his
own
want
of
caution
luke
i
implore
you
tell
me
said
sybil
who
had
listened
to
the
sexton
shuddering
as
it
were
beneath
the
chilly
influence
of
his
malevolent
glance
is
this
true
does
your
fate
depend
upon
eleanor
mowbray
who
is
she
what
has
she
to
do
with
rookwood
have
you
seen
her
do
you
love
her
i
have
never
seen
her
replied
luke
thank
heaven
for
that
cried
sybil
then
you
love
her
not
how
were
that
possible
returned
luke
do
i
not
say
i
have
not
seen
her
who
is
she
then
this
old
man
tells
me
she
is
my
cousin
she
is
betrothed
to
my
brother
ranulph
how
ejaculated
sybil
and
would
you
snatch
his
betrothed
from
your
brother
arms
would
you
do
him
this
grievous
wrong
is
it
not
enough
that
you
must
wrest
from
him
that
which
he
has
long
deemed
his
own
and
if
he
has
falsely
deemed
it
so
it
will
not
make
his
loss
the
less
bitter
if
you
do
thus
wrong
your
brother
do
not
look
for
happiness
do
not
look
for
respect
for
neither
will
be
your
portion
even
this
old
man
shrinks
aghast
at
such
a
deed
his
eyes
are
buried
on
the
ground
see
i
have
moved
even
and
in
truth
peter
did
appear
for
an
instant
strangely
moved
is
nothing
returned
he
mastering
his
emotion
by
a
strong
effort
what
is
all
this
to
me
i
never
had
a
brother
i
never
had
aught
wife
child
or
relative
that
loved
me
and
i
love
not
the
world
nor
the
things
of
the
world
nor
those
that
inhabit
the
world
but
i
know
what
sways
the
world
and
its
inhabitants
and
that
is
self
and
let
luke
reflect
on
this
the
key
to
rookwood
is
eleanor
mowbray
the
hand
that
grasps
hers
grasps
those
lands
thus
saith
the
prophecy
it
is
a
lying
prophecy
it
was
uttered
by
one
of
your
race
by
whom
by
barbara
lovel
said
peter
with
a
sneer
of
triumph
ha
heed
him
not
exclaimed
luke
as
sybil
recoiled
at
this
intelligence
i
am
yours
not
mine
not
mine
shrieked
she
but
oh
not
whither
go
you
cried
luke
as
sybil
half
bewildered
tore
herself
from
him
to
barbara
lovel
i
will
go
with
you
no
let
me
go
alone
i
have
much
to
ask
her
yet
tarry
not
with
this
old
man
dear
luke
or
close
your
ears
to
his
crafty
talk
avoid
him
oh
i
am
sick
at
heart
follow
me
not
i
implore
you
follow
me
not
and
with
distracted
air
she
darted
amongst
the
mouldering
cloisters
leaving
luke
stupefied
with
anguish
and
surprise
the
sexton
maintained
a
stern
and
stoical
composure
she
is
a
woman
after
all
muttered
he
all
her
resolves
melt
like
snow
in
the
sunshine
at
the
thought
of
a
rival
i
congratulate
you
grandson
luke
you
are
free
from
your
fetters
free
echoed
luke
quit
my
sight
i
loathe
to
look
upon
you
you
have
broken
the
truest
heart
that
ever
beat
in
woman
bosom
tut
tut
returned
peter
it
is
not
broken
yet
wait
till
we
hear
what
old
barbara
has
got
to
say
and
meanwhile
we
must
arrange
with
dick
turpin
the
price
of
that
certificate
the
knave
knows
its
value
well
come
be
a
man
this
is
worse
than
womanish
and
at
length
he
succeeded
half
by
force
and
half
by
persuasion
in
dragging
luke
away
with
him

like
a
dove
escaped
from
the
talons
of
the
falcon
sybil
fled
from
the
clutches
of
the
sexton
her
brain
was
in
a
whirl
her
blood
on
fire
she
had
no
distinct
perception
of
external
objects
no
definite
notion
of
what
she
herself
was
about
to
do
and
glided
more
like
a
flitting
spirit
than
a
living
woman
along
the
ruined
ambulatory
her
hair
had
fallen
in
disorder
over
her
face
she
stayed
not
to
adjust
it
but
tossed
aside
the
blinding
locks
with
frantic
impatience
she
felt
as
one
may
feel
who
tries
to
strain
his
nerves
shattered
by
illness
to
the
endurance
of
some
dreadful
yet
necessary
pain
sybil
loved
her
granddame
old
barbara
but
it
was
with
a
love
tempered
by
fear
barbara
was
not
a
person
to
inspire
esteem
or
to
claim
affection
she
was
regarded
by
the
wild
tribe
which
she
ruled
as
their
with
some
such
feeling
of
inexplicable
awe
as
is
entertained
by
the
african
slave
for
the
obeah
woman
they
acknowledged
her
power
unhesitatingly
obeyed
her
commands
and
shrank
with
terror
from
her
anathema
which
was
indeed
seldom
pronounced
but
when
uttered
was
considered
as
doom
her
tribe
she
looked
upon
as
her
flock
and
stretched
her
maternal
hand
over
all
ready
alike
to
cherish
or
chastise
and
having
already
survived
a
generation
that
which
succeeded
having
from
infancy
imbibed
a
superstitious
veneration
for
the
cunning
woman
as
she
was
called
the
sentiment
could
never
be
wholly
effaced
winding
her
way
she
knew
not
how
through
roofless
halls
over
disjointed
fragments
of
fallen
pillars
sybil
reached
a
flight
of
steps
a
door
studded
with
iron
nails
stayed
her
progress
it
was
an
old
strong
oaken
frame
surmounted
by
a
gothic
arch
in
the
keystone
of
which
leered
one
of
those
grotesque
demoniacal
faces
with
which
the
fathers
of
the
church
delighted
to
adorn
their
shrines
sybil
looked
up
her
glance
encountered
the
fantastical
visage
it
recalled
the
features
of
the
sexton
and
seemed
to
mock
her
to
revile
her
her
fortitude
at
once
deserted
her
her
fingers
were
upon
the
handle
of
the
door
she
hesitated
she
even
drew
back
with
the
intention
of
departing
for
she
felt
then
that
she
dared
not
face
barbara
it
was
too
late
she
had
moved
the
handle
a
deep
voice
from
within
called
to
her
by
name
she
dared
not
disobey
that
call
she
entered
the
room
in
which
sybil
found
herself
was
the
only
entire
apartment
now
existing
in
the
priory
it
had
survived
the
ravages
of
time
it
had
escaped
the
devastation
of
man
whose
ravages
outstrip
those
of
time
octagonal
lofty
yet
narrow
you
saw
at
once
that
it
formed
the
interior
of
a
turret
it
was
lighted
by
a
small
oriel
window
commanding
a
lovely
view
of
the
scenery
around
and
paneled
with
oak
richly
wrought
in
ribs
and
groins
and
from
overhead
depended
a
molded
ceiling
of
honeycomb
this
room
had
something
even
now
in
the
days
of
its
desecration
of
monastic
beauty
about
it
where
the
odor
of
sanctity
had
breathed
forth
the
fumes
of
idolatry
prevailed
but
imagination
ever
on
the
wing
flew
back
to
that
period
and
a
tradition
to
that
effect
warranted
the
supposition
when
perchance
it
had
been
the
sanctuary
and
the
privacy
of
the
prior
self
wrapped
in
a
cloak
composed
of
the
skins
of
various
animals
upon
a
low
pallet
covered
with
stained
scarlet
cloth
sat
barbara
around
her
head
was
coiffed
in
folds
like
those
of
an
asiatic
turban
a
rich
though
faded
shawl
and
her
waist
was
encircled
with
the
magic
zodiacal
zone
proper
to
the
sorceress
the
of
the
cingara
whence
the
name
zingaro
according
to
moncada
which
barbara
had
brought
from
spain
from
her
ears
depended
long
golden
drops
of
curious
antique
fashioning
and
upon
her
withered
fingers
which
looked
like
a
coil
of
lizards
were
hooped
a
multitude
of
silver
rings
of
the
purest
and
simplest
manufacture
they
seemed
almost
of
massive
unwrought
metal
her
skin
was
yellow
as
the
body
of
a
toad
corrugated
as
its
back
she
might
have
been
steeped
in
saffron
from
her
finger
tips
the
nails
of
which
were
of
the
same
hue
to
such
portions
of
her
neck
as
were
visible
and
which
was
puckered
up
like
the
throat
of
a
turtle
to
look
at
her
one
might
have
thought
the
embalmer
had
experimented
her
art
upon
herself
so
dead
so
bloodless
so
blackened
seemed
the
flesh
where
flesh
remained
leather
could
scarce
be
tougher
than
her
skin
she
seemed
like
an
animated
mummy
a
frame
so
tanned
appeared
calculated
to
endure
for
ages
and
perhaps
might
have
done
so
but
alas
the
soul
can
not
be
embalmed
no
oil
can
that
precious
lamp
and
that
vital
spark
was
fast
waning
was
evident
from
her
heavy
eyes
once
of
a
swimming
black
and
lengthy
as
a
witch
which
were
now
sinister
and
sunken
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
was
as
strongly
impregnated
as
a
museum
with
volatile
odors
emitted
from
the
stores
of
drugs
with
which
the
shelves
were
loaded
as
well
as
from
various
stuffed
specimens
of
birds
and
wild
animals

living
companion
was
a
monstrous
owl
which
perched
over
the
old
gipsy
head
hissed
a
token
of
recognition
as
sybil
advanced
from
a
hook
placed
in
the
plaster
roof
was
suspended
a
globe
of
crystal
glass
about
the
size
and
shape
of
a
large
gourd
filled
with
a
pure
pellucid
liquid
in
which
a
small
snake
the
egyptian
aspic
described
perpetual
gyrations
dim
were
the
eyes
of
barbara
yet
not
altogether
sightless
the
troubled
demeanor
of
her
grandchild
struck
her
as
she
entered
she
felt
the
hot
drops
upon
her
hand
as
sybil
stooped
to
kiss
it
she
heard
her
sobs
what
ails
you
child
said
barbara
in
a
voice
that
rattled
in
her
throat
and
hollow
as
the
articulation
of
a
phantom
have
you
heard
tidings
of
luke
bradley
has
any
ill
befallen
him
i
said
you
would
either
hear
of
him
or
see
him
this
morning
he
is
not
returned
i
see
what
have
you
heard
he
returned
replied
sybil
faintly
and
no
ill
hath
happened
to
him
he
returned
and
you
are
here
echoed
barbara
no
ill
hath
happened
to
thou
sayest
am
i
to
understand
there
is
to
sybil
answered
not
she
could
not
answer
i
see
i
see
said
barbara
more
gently
her
head
and
hand
shaking
with
paralytic
affection
a
quarrel
a
lover
quarrel
old
as
i
am
i
have
not
forgotten
my
feelings
as
a
girl
what
woman
ever
does
if
she
be
woman
and
you
like
your
poor
mother
are
a
wench
she
loved
her
husband
as
a
husband
should
be
loved
sybil
and
though
she
loved
me
well
she
loved
him
better
as
was
right
ah
it
was
a
bitter
day
when
she
left
me
for
spain
for
though
to
one
of
our
wandering
race
all
countries
are
alike
yet
the
soil
of
our
birth
is
dear
to
us
and
the
presence
of
our
kindred
dearer
well
well
i
will
not
think
of
that
she
is
gone
nay
take
it
not
so
to
heart
wench
luke
has
a
hasty
temper
is
not
the
first
time
i
have
told
you
so
he
will
not
bear
rebuke
and
you
have
questioned
him
too
shrewdly
touching
his
absence
is
it
not
so
heed
it
not
trust
me
you
will
have
him
seek
your
forgiveness
ere
the
shadows
shorten
the
noontide
sun
alas
alas
said
sybil
sadly
this
is
no
lover
quarrel
which
may
at
once
be
forgotten
and
forgiven
would
it
were
so
what
is
it
then
asked
barbara
and
without
waiting
sybil
answer
she
continued
with
vehemence
has
he
wronged
you
tell
me
girl
in
what
way
speak
that
i
may
avenge
you
if
your
wrong
requires
revenge
are
you
blood
of
mine
and
think
i
will
not
do
this
for
you
girl
none
of
the
blood
of
barbara
lovel
were
ever
unrevenged
when
richard
cooper
stabbed
my
francis
he
fled
to
flanders
to
escape
my
wrath
but
he
did
not
escape
it
i
pursued
him
thither
i
hunted
him
out
drove
him
back
to
his
own
country
and
brought
him
to
the
gallows
it
took
a
power
of
gold
what
matter
revenge
is
dearer
than
gold
and
as
it
was
with
richard
cooper
so
it
shall
be
with
luke
bradley
i
will
catch
him
though
he
run
i
will
trip
him
though
he
leap
i
will
reach
him
though
he
flee
afar
i
will
drag
him
hither
by
the
hair
of
his
head
added
she
with
a
livid
smile
and
clutching
at
the
air
with
her
hands
as
if
in
the
act
of
pulling
some
one
towards
her
he
shall
wed
you
within
the
hour
if
you
will
have
it
or
if
your
honor
need
that
it
should
be
so
my
power
is
not
departed
from
me
my
people
are
yet
at
my
command
i
am
still
their
queen
and
woe
to
him

sybil
affrighted
at

ancient
line

proud

ha
i

the
old
gipsy
raising

her
throat

sybil
gasping
with
horror

a
ring
upon

finger

desert
him
bethink
you
of
a
prophecy
you
uttered
a
prophecy
ha
and
with
slow
enunciation
sybil
pronounced
the
mystic
words
which
she
had
heard
repeated
by
the
sexton
as
she
spoke
a
gloom
like
that
of
a
began
to
gather
over
the
brow
of
the
old
gipsy
the
orbs
of
her
sunken
eyes
expanded
and
wrath
supplied
her
frame
with
vigor
she
arose

horoscope
i
have
watched
your
natal
star
it

under
the
baleful
influence
of
scorpion
and
fiery
saturn
sheds
his
lurid
glance
upon
it
let
me
see
your
hand
the
line
of
life
is
drawn
out
distinct
and
clear
it
runs
ha
what
means
that
intersection
beware
beware
my
sybil
act
as
i
tell
you
and
you
are
safe
i
will
make
another
trial
by
the
crystal
bowl
attend
muttering
some
strange
words
sounding
like
a
spell
barbara
with
the
bifurcate
hazel
staff
which
she
used
as
a
described
a
circle
upon
the
floor
within
this
circle
she
drew
other
lines
from
angle
to
angle
forming
seven
triangles
the
bases
of
which
constituted
the
sides
of
a
septilateral
figure
this
figure
she
studied
intently
for
a
few
moments
she
then
raised
her
wand
and
touched
the
owl
with
it
the
bird
unfolded
its
wings
and
arose
in
flight
then
slowly
circled
round
the
pendulous
globe
each
time
it
drew
nearer
until
at
length
it
touched
the
glassy
bowl
with
its
flapping
pinions
enough
ejaculated
barbara
and
at
another
motion
from
her
rod
the
bird
stayed
its
flight
and
returned
to
its
perch
barbara
arose
she
struck
the
globe
with
her
staff
the
pure
lymph
became
instantly
tinged
with
crimson
as
if
blood
had
been
commingled
with
it
the
little
serpent
could
be
seen
within
coiled
up
and
knotted
as
in
the
struggles
of
death
again
i
say
beware
ejaculated
barbara
solemnly
this
is
ominous
of
sybil
had
sunk
from
faintness
on
the
pallet
a
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
who
is
without
cried
barbara
is
i
balthazar
replied
a
voice
thou
mayest
enter
answered
barbara
and
an
old
man
with
a
long
beard
white
as
snow
reaching
to
his
girdle
and
a
costume
which
might
be
said
to
resemble
the
raiment
of
a
jewish
high
priest
made
his
appearance
this
venerable
personage
was
no
other
than
the
patrico
or
hierophant
of
the
canting
crew
i
come
to
tell
you
that
there
are
strangers
ladies
within
the
priory
said
the
patrico
gravely
i
have
searched
for
you
in
vain
continued
he
addressing
sybil
the
younger
of
them
seems
to
need
your
assistance
whence
come
they
exclaimed
barbara
they
have
ridden
i
understand
from
rookwood
answered
the
patrico
they
were
on
their
way
to
davenham
when
they
were
prevented
from
rookwood
echoed
sybil
their
names
did
you
hear
their
names
mowbray
is
the
name
of
both
they
are
a
mother
and
a
daughter
the
younger
is
called
eleanor
asked
sybil
with
an
acute
foreboding
of
calamity
eleanor
is
the
name
assuredly
replied
the
patrico
somewhat
surprised
i
heard
the
elder
whom
i
guess
to
be
her
mother
so
address
her
gracious
god
she
here
exclaimed
sybil
here
eleanor
mowbray
here
cried
barbara
within
my
power
not
a
moment
is
to
be
lost
balthazar
hasten
round
the
tents
not
a
man
must
leave
his
place
above
all
luke
bradley
see
that
these
mowbrays
are
detained
within
the
abbey
let
the
bell
be
sounded
quick
quick
leave
this
wench
to
me
she
is
not
well
i
have
much
to
do
away
with
thee
man
and
let
me
know
when
thou
hast
done
it
and
as
balthazar
departed
on
his
mission
with
a
glance
of
triumph
in
her
eyes
barbara
exclaimed
soh
no
sooner
hath
the
thought
possessed
me
than
the
means
of
accomplishment
appear
it
shall
be
done
at
once
i
will
tie
the
knot
i
will
untie
and
then
retie
it
this
weak
wench
must
be
nerved
to
the
task
added
she
regarding
the
senseless
form
of
sybil
here
is
that
will
stimulate
her
opening
the
cupboard
and
taking
a
small
phial
this
will
fortify
her
and
this
continued
she
with
a
ghastly
smile
laying
her
hand
upon
another
vessel
this
shall
remove
her
rival
when
all
is
fulfilled
this
liquid
shall
constrain
her
lover
to
be
her
titled
landed
husband
ha
ha
concert
sir
we
have
musicians
too
among
us
true
merry
beggars
indeed
that
being
within
the
reach
of
the
lash
for
singing
libellous
songs
at
london
were
fain
to
fly
into
one
cover
and
here
they
sing
all
our
poets
ditties
they
can
sing
anything
most
tunably
sir
but
psalms
what
they
may
do
hereafter
under
a
triple
tree
is
much
expected
but
they
live
very
civilly
and
genteelly
among
us
but
what
is
here
that
solemn
old
fellow
that
neither
speaks
of
himself
or
any
for
him
o
sir
the
rarest
man
of
all
he
is
a
prophet
see
how
he
holds
up
his
prognosticating
nose
he
is
divining
now
how
a
prophet
yes
sir
a
cunning
man
and
a
a
very
ancient
stroller
all
the
world
over
and
has
travelled
with
gipsies
and
is
a
patrico
merry
in
consequence
of
some
few
words
which
the
sexton
let
fall
in
the
presence
of
the
attendants
during
breakfast
more
perhaps
by
design
than
accident
it
was
speedily
rumored
throughout
the
camp
that
the
redoubted
richard
turpin
was
for
the
time
its
inmate
this
intelligence
produced
some
such
sensation
as
is
experienced
by
the
inhabitants
of
a
petty
town
on
the
sudden
arrival
of
a
prince
of
the
blood
a
or
other
illustrious
and
distinguished
personage
whose
fame
has
been
vaunted
abroad
amongst
his
fellowmen
by
rumor
and
her
thousand
tongues
and
who
like
our
highwayman
has
rendered
himself
sufficiently
notorious
to
be
an
object
of
admiration
and
emulation
amongst
his
contemporaries
all
started
up
at
the
news
the
upright
man
the
chief
of
the
crew
arose
from
his
chair
donned
his
gown
of
state
a
very
ancient
brocade
filched
most
probably
from
the
wardrobe
of
some
strolling
player
grasped
his
baton
of
office
a
stout
oaken
truncheon
and
sallied
forth
the
ruffler
who
found
his
representative
in
a
very
magnificently
equipped
and
by
no
means
knave
whose
chin
was
decorated
with
a
beard
as
lengthy
and
as
black
as
sultan
mahmoud
together
with
the
dexterous
hooker
issued
forth
from
the
hovel
which
they
termed
their
boozing
ken
eager
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
prince
of
the
the
limping
palliard
tore
the
bandages
from
his
mock
wounds
shouldered
his
crutch
and
trudged
hastily
after
them
the
unbuckled
his
strap
threw
away
his
timber
leg
and
leapt

up

all
bent
on
one
grand
object
that
of
having
a
peep
at
the
foremost
man
of
all
this
prigging
world
dick
turpin
at
the
period
of
which
we
treat
was
in
the
zenith
of
his
reputation
his
deeds
were
full
blown
his
exploits
were
in
every
mouth
and
a
heavy
price
was
set
upon
his
head
that
he
should
show
himself
thus
openly
where
he
might
be
so
easily
betrayed
excited
no
little
surprise
among
the
craftiest
of
the
crew
and
augured
an
excess
of
temerity
on
his
part
rash
daring
was
the
main
feature
of
character
like
our
great
nelson
he
knew
fear
only
by
name
and
when
he
thus
trusted
himself
in
the
hands
of
strangers
confident
in
himself
and
in
his
own
resources
he
felt
perfectly
easy
as
to
the
result
he
relied
also
in
the
continuance
of
his
good
fortune
which
had
as
yet
never
deserted
him
possessed
of
the
belief
that
his
hour
was
not
yet
come
he
cared
little
or
nothing
for
any
risk
he
might
incur
and
though
he
might
undoubtedly
have
some
presentiment
of
the
probable
termination
of
his
career
he
never
suffered
it
to
militate
against
his
present
enjoyment
which
proved
that
he
was
no
despicable
philosopher
turpin
was
the
the
last
of
a
race
which
we
were
almost
about
to
say
we
regret
is
now
altogether
extinct
several
successors
he
had
it
is
true
but
no
name
worthy
to
be
recorded
after
his
own
with
him
expired
the
chivalrous
spirit
which
animated
successively
the
bosoms
of
so
many
knights
of
the
road
with
him
died
away
that
passionate
love
of
enterprise
that
high
spirit
of
devotion
to
the
fair
sex
which
was
first
breathed
upon
the
highway
by
the
gay
gallant
claude
the
bayard
of
the
road
filou
sans
peur
et
sans
but
which
was
extinguished
at
last
by
the
cord
that
tied
the
heroic
turpin
to
the
remorseless
tree
it
were
a
subject
well
worthy
of
inquiry
to
trace
this
decline
and
fall
of
the
empire
of
the
tobymen
to
its
remoter
causes
to
ascertain
the
why
and
the
wherefore
that
with
so
many
captains
so
many
poor
curates
so
many
lieutenants
of
both
services
without
hopes
of
promotion
so
many
and
fashionable
novelists
so
many
damned
dramatists
and
damning
critics
so
many
edinburgh
and
quarterly
reviewers
so
many
detrimental
brothers
and
younger
sons
when
there
are
horses
to
be
hired
pistols
to
be
borrowed
purses
to
be
taken
and
mails
are
as
plentiful
as
partridges
it
were
worth
serious
investigation
we
repeat
to
ascertain
why
with
the
best
material
imaginable
for
a
new
race
of
highwaymen
we
have
none
not
even
an
amateur
why
do
not
some
of
these
choice
spirits
quit
the
of
and
take
to
the
road
the
air
of
the
heath
is
more
bracing
and
wholesome
we
should
conceive
than
that
of
any
hell
whatever
and
the
chances
of
success
incomparably
greater
we
throw
out
this
hint
without
a
doubt
of
seeing
it
followed
up
probably
the
solution
of
our
inquiry
may
be
that
the
supply
is
greater
than
the
demand
that
in
the
present
state
of
things
embryo
highwaymen
may
be
more
abundant
than
purses
and
then
have
we
not
the
with
such
an
system
of
conservation
it
is
vain
to
anticipate
a
change
the
highwaymen
we
fear
like
their
irish
brothers
the
rapparees
went
out
with
the
tories
they
were
averse
to
reform
and
eschewed
emancipation
lest
any
one
should
think
we
have
overrated
the
pleasures
of
the
highwayman
existence
they
shall
hear
what
the
right
villainous
jack
hall
a
celebrated
tobyman
of
his
day
has
got
to
say
on
the
subject
his
life
the
highwayman
has
generally
the
most
mirth
and
the
least
care
in
it
of
any
man
breathing
and
all
he
deals
for
is
clear
profit
he
has
that
point
of
good
conscience
that
he
always
sells
as
he
buys
a
good
pennyworth
which
is
something
rare
since
he
trades
with
so
small
a
stock
the
and
he
are
like
the
devil
and
the
doctor
they
live
by
one
another
and
like
traitors
is
best
to
keep
each
other
counsel
he
has
this
point
of
honesty
that
he
never
robs
the
house
he
frequents
turpin
had
the
same
scruples
respecting
the
hall
of
rookwood
in
sir
piers
lifetime
and
perhaps
pays
his
debts
better
than
some
others
for
he
holds
it
below
the
dignity
of
his
employment
to
commit
so
ungenteel
a
crime
as
insolvency
and
loves
to
pay
nobly
he
has
another
quality
not
much
amiss
that
he
takes
no
more
than
he
has
occasion
for
jack
we
think
was
a
little
mistaken
here
which
he
verifies
this
way
he
craves
no
more
while
that
lasts
he
is
a
less
nuisance
in
a
commonwealth
than
a
miser
because
the
money
he
engrosses
all
circulates
again
which
the
other
hoards
as
though
only
to
be
found
again
at
the
day
of
judgment
he
is
the
of
his
family
which
the
gallows
instead
of
the
parson
claims
as
its
due
he
has
reason
enough
to
be
bold
in
his
undertakings
for
though
all
the
world
threaten
him
he
stands
in
fear
of
but
one
man
in
it
and
the
hangman
and
with
him
too
he
is
generally
in
fee
however
i
can
not
affirm
he
is
so
valiant
that
he
dares
look
any
man
in
the
face
for
in
that
point
he
is
now
and
then
a
little
modest
newgate
may
be
said
to
be
his
where
he
frequently
lives
so
many
months
in
the
year
and
he
is
not
so
much
concerned
to
be
carried
thither
for
a
small
matter
if
only
for
the
benefit
of
renewing
his
acquaintance
there
he
holds
a
petit
larceny
as
light
as
a
nun
does
auricular
confession
though
the
priest
has
a
more
compassionate
character
than
the
hangman
every
man
in
this
community
is
esteemed
according
to
his
particular
quality
of
which
there
are
several
degrees
though
it
is
contrary
often
to
public
government
for
here
a
man
shall
be
valued
purely
for
his
merit
and
rise
by
it
too
though
it
be
but
to
a
halter
in
which
there
is
a
great
deal
of
glory
in
dying
like
a
hero
and
making
a
decent
figure
in
the
cart
to
the
last
two
staves
of
the
psalm
this
we
repeat
is
the
plain
statement
of
a
practical
man
and
again
we
throw
out
the
hint
for
adoption
all
we
regret
is
that
we
are
now
degenerated
from
the
grand
tobyman
to
the
cracksman
and
the
sneak
about
whom
there
are
no
redeeming
features
how
much
lower
the
next
generation
of
thieves
will
dive
it

gave
the
highwayman
his
de
the
last
of
this
race
for
we
must
persist
in
maintaining
that
he
the
last
turpin
like
the
setting
sun
threw
up
some
parting
rays
of
glory
and
tinged
the
far
highways
with
a
luster
that
may
yet
be
traced
like
a
cloud
of
dust
raised
by
his
horse
retreating
heels
unequalled
in
the
command
of
his
steed
the
most
singular
feat
that
the
whole
race
of
the
annals
of
horsemanship
has
to
record
and
of
which
we
may
have
more
to
say
hereafter
was
achieved
by
him
so
perfect
was
his
jockeyship
so
clever
his
management
of
the
animal
he
mounted
so
intimately
acquainted
was
he
with
every
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
metropolis
a
book
of
which
he
constructed
and
carried
constantly
about
his
person
as
well
as
with
many
other
parts
of
england
particularly
the
counties
of
chester
york
and
lancaster
that
he
outstripped
every
pursuer
and
baffled
all
attempts
at
capture
his
reckless
daring
his
restless
rapidity
for
so
suddenly
did
he
change
his
ground
and
renew
his
attacks
in
other
quarters
that
he
seemed
to
be
endowed
with
ubiquity
his
bravery
his
resolution
and
above
all
his
generosity
won
for
him
a
high
reputation
amongst
his
compatriots
and
even
elicited
applauses
from
those
upon
whom
he
levied
his
contributions
beyond
dispute
he
ruled
as
master
of
the
road
his
hands
were
as
yet
unstained
with
blood
he
was
ever
prompt
to
check
the
disposition
to
outrage
and
to
prevent
as
much
as
lay
in
his
power
the
commission
of
violence
by
his
associates
of
late
since
he
had
possessed
himself
of
his
favorite
mare
black
bess
his
robberies
had
been
perpetrated
with
a
suddenness
of
succession
and
at
distances
so
apparently
impracticable
that
the
idea
of
all
having
been
executed
by
one
man
was
rejected
as
an
impossibility
and
the
only
way
of
reconciling
the
description
of
the
horse
and
rider
which
tallied
in
each
instance
was
the
supposition
that
these
attacks
were
performed
by
confederates
similarly
mounted
and
similarly
accoutred
there
was
in
all
this
as
much
of
the
sacra
as
of
the
of
the
hungering
after
distinction
as
well
as
of
the
appetite
of
gain
enamored
of
his
vocation
turpin
delighted
to
hear
himself
designated
as
the
flying
highwayman
and
it
was
with
rapturous
triumph
that
he
found
his
feats
attributed
to
a
band
of
marauders
but
this
state
of
things
could
not
long
endure
his
secret
was
blown
the
vigilance
of
the
police
was
aroused
he
was
tracked
to
his
haunts
and
after
a
number
of
hairbreadth
which
he
only
effected
by
miracle
or
by
the
aid
of
his
mare
he
reluctantly
quitted
the
heathy
hills
of
bagshot
the
pampas
plains
of
hounslow
over
which
like
an
archetype
of
the
galloping
sir
francis
head
he
had
so
often
scoured
the
gorsy
commons
of
highgate
hampstead
and
finchley
the
marshy
fields
of
battersea
almost
all
of
which
he
had
been
known
to
visit
in
a
single
night
and
leaving
these
beaten
tracks
to
the
occupation
of
younger
and
less
practised
hands
he
bequeathed
to
them
at
the
same
time
his
own
reversionary
interest
in
the
gibbets
thereupon
erected
and
betook
himself
to
the
country
after
a
journey
of
more
or
less
success
our
adventurer
found
himself
at
rookwood
whither
he
had
been
invited
after
a
grand
by
its
hospitable
and
by
no
means
inquisitive
owner

of
faith
and
good
fellowship

no
part
of

character
he
had
his
lights
as
well
as
his
shades
and
as
long
as
sir
piers
lived
his
purse
and
coffers
would
have
been

from
molestation

so

know
are
longs
for
odd
and
even
a
bale
of

of
which

always
carried
with
him
beyond
this
excepting
a

a

the
mark
a

at
a
leap
or
some
such
trifle
to
which
the
most
scrupulous
could
not
raise
an
objection
dick
was
all
fair
and
but
when
poor
sir
piers
had
put
on
his
wooden
surtout
to
use
dick
own
expressive
metaphor
his
conscientious
scruples
evaporated
into
thin
air
lady
rookwood
was
nothing
to
him
there
was
excellent
booty
to
be
appropriated
the
wise
it
call
he
began
to
look
about
for
hands
and
having
accidentally
encountered
his
old
comrades
rust
and
wilder
they
were
let
into
the
business
which
was
imperfectly
accomplished
in
the
manner
heretofore
described
to
return
from
this
digression
when
turpin
presented
himself
at
the
threshold
of
the
door
on
his
way
to
inquire
after
his
mare
to
his
astonishment
he
found
it
closely
invested
a
cheering
shout
from
the
tawny
throng
succeeded
by
a
general
clapping
of
hands
and
attended
by
a
buzzing
susurration
of
applause
such
as
welcomes
the
entrance
of
a
popular
actor
upon
the
stage
greeted
the
appearance
of
the
highwayman
at
the
first
sight
of
the
crowd
he
was
a
little
startled
and
involuntarily
sought
for
his
pistols
but
the
demonstrations
of
admiration
were
too
unequivocal
to
be
for
a
moment
mistaken
his
hand
was
drawn
from
his
pocket
to
raise
his
hat
from
his
brow
thunders
of
applause
turpin
external
man
we
have
before
said
was
singularly
prepossessing
it
was
especially
so
in
the
eyes
of
sex
fair
we
certainly
can
not
say
upon
the
present
occasion
amongst
whom
not
a
single
dissentient
voice
was
to
be
heard
all
concurred
in
thinking
him
a
fine
fellow
could
plainly
read
his
high
courage
in
his
bearing
his
good
breeding
in
his
débonnaire
deportment
and
his
manly
beauty
in
his
extravagant
red
whiskers
dick
saw
the
effect
that
he
produced
he
was
at
home
in
a
moment
your
true
highwayman
has
ever
a
passion
for
effect
this
does
not
desert
him
at
the
gallows
it
rises
superior
to
death
itself
and
has
been
known
to
influence
the
manner
of
his
dangling
from
the
gibbet
to
hear
some
one
cry
there
goes
a
proper
handsome
man
saith
our
previously
quoted
authority
jack
hall
somewhat
ameliorates
the
terrible
thoughts
of
the
meagre
tyrant
death
and
to
go
in
a
dirty
shirt
were
enough
to
save
the
hangman
a
labor
and
make
a
man
die
with
grief
and
shame
at
being
in
that
deplorable
condition
with
a
gracious
smile
of
condescension
like
a
popular
orator
with
a
look
of
blarney
like
that
of
and
of
assurance
like
that
of
hume
he
surveyed
the
male
portion
of
the
spectators
tipped
a
knowing
wink
at
the
prettiest
brunettes
he
could
select
and
finally
cut
a
sort
of
fling
with
his
legs
that
brought
down
another
appeal
of
rapturous
applause
a
rank
scamp
cried
the
upright
man
and
this
exclamation
however
equivocal
it
may
sound
was
intended
on
his
part
to
be
highly
complimentary

word
for
it
returned
the
or
sham
sailor
look
at
his
rigging
see
how
he
flashes
his
sticks
those
are
the
tools
to
rake
a
he
as
clever
a
craft
as
i
seen
this
many
a
day
or
i
no
judge
the
women
were
equally
enchanted
equally
eloquent
in
the
expression
of
their
admiration
what
ogles
cried
a
mort
what
pins
said
an
autem
mort
or
married
woman
sharp
as
needles
said
a
dell
who
had
encountered
one
of
the
free
and
frolicsome
glances
which
our
highwayman
distributed
so
liberally
among
the
petticoats
it
was
at
this
crisis
dick
took
off
his
hat
cæsar
betrayed
his
baldness
a
thousand
pities
cried
the
men
compassionating
his
thinly
covered
skull
and
twisting
their
own
ringlets
glossy
and
luxuriant
though
unconscious
of
macassar
a
thousand
pities
that
so
fine
a
fellow
should
have
a
sconce
like
a
cocoanut
but
then
his
red
whiskers
rejoined
the
women
tired
of
the
uniformity
of
thick
black
heads
of
hair
what
a
warmth
of
coloring
they
impart
to
his
face
and
then
only
look
how
beautifully
bushy
they
make
his
cheeks
appear
la
fosseuse
and
the
court
of
the
queen
of
navarre
were
not
more
smitten
with
the
sieur
de
croix
jolly
pair
of
whiskers
the
hawk
eye
of
turpin
ranged
over
the
whole
assemblage
amidst
that
throng
of
dark
faces
there
was
not
one
familiar
to
him
before
him
stood
the
upright
man
zoroaster
so
was
he
called
a
sturdy
stalwart
rogue
whose
superior
strength
and
stature
as
has
not
unfrequently
been
the
case
in
the
infancy
of
governments
that
have
risen
to
more
importance
than
is
likely
to
be
the
case
with
that
of
lesser
egypt
had
been
the
means
of
his
elevation
to
his
present
dignified
position
zoroaster
literally
his
way
upwards
and
had
at
first
to
maintain
his
situation
by
the
strong
arm
but
he
now
was
enabled
to
repose
upon
his
laurels
to
smoke
the
calumet
of
peace
and
quaff
his
tipple
with
impunity
for
one
of
gipsy
blood
he
presented
an
unusually
jovial
countenance
his
eye
was
mirthful
his
lip
moist
as
if
from
oft
potations
his
cheek
mellow
as
an
orleans
plum
which
fruit
in
color
and
texture
it
mightily
resembled
strange
to
say
also
for
one
of
that
lithe
race
his
person
was
heavy
and
hebetudinous
the
consequence
no
doubt
of
habitual
intemperance
like
cribb
he
waxed
obese
upon
the
championship
there
was
a
kind
of
mock
state
in
his
carriage
as
he
placed
himself
before
turpin
and
with
his
left
hand
twisted
up
the
tail
of
his
while
the
right
thrust
his
truncheon
into
his
hip
which
was
infinitely
diverting
to
the
highwayman
turpin
attention
however
was
chiefly
directed
towards
his
neighbor
the
ruffler
in
whom
he
recognized
a
famous
impostor
of
the
day
with
whose
history
he
was
sufficiently
well
acquainted
to
be
able
at
once
to
identify
the
individual
we
have
before
stated
that
a
magnificent
beard
decorated
the
chin
of
this
worthy
but
this
was
not
all
his
costume
was
in
perfect
keeping
with
his
beard
and
consisted
of
a
very
tunic
upon
the
breast
of
which
was
embroidered
in
golden
wire
the
maltese
cross
while
over
his
shoulders
were
thrown
the
folds
of
an
ample
cloak
of
tyrian
hue
to
his
side
was
girt
a
long
and
doughty
sword
which
he
termed
in
his
knightly
phrase
excalibur
and
upon
his
profuse
hair
rested
a
hat
as
broad
in
the
brim
as
a
spanish
sombrero
exaggerated
as
this
description
may
appear
we
can
assure
our
readers
that
it
is
not
overdrawn
and
that
a
counterpart
of
the
sketch
we
have
given
of
the
ruffler
certainly
strutted
his
hour
upon
the
stage
of
human
life
and
that
the
very
ancient
and
discriminating
city
of
canterbury
to
which
be
all
honor
was
his
theatre
of
action
his
history
is
so
far
curious
that
it
exemplifies
more
strongly
than
a
thousand
discourses
could
do
how
prone
we
are
to
be
governed
by
appearances
and
how
easily
we
may
be
made
the
dupes
of
a
plausible
impostor
be
it
remembered
however
that
we
treat
of
the
eighteenth
century
before
the
march
of
intellect
had
commenced
we
are
much
too
knowing
to
be
similarly
practised
upon
in
these
enlightened
times
but
we
will
let
the
knight
of
malta
for
such
was
the
title
assumed
by
the
ruffler
tell
his
own
story
in
his
own
way
hereafter
contenting
ourselves
with
the
moral
precepts
we
have
already
deduced
from
it
next
to
the
knight
of
malta
stood
the
habited
in
his
sailor
gear
striped
shirt
and
dirty
canvas
trousers
and
adjoining
him
was
the
palliard
a
loathsome
tatterdemalion
his
dress
one
heap
of
rags
and
his
discolored
skin
one
mass
of
artificial
leprosy
and
imposthumes
as
turpin
eye
shifted
from
one
to
another
of
these
figures
he
chanced
upon
an
individual
who
had
been
long
endeavoring
to
arrest
his
attention
this
personage
was
completely
in
the
background
all
that
dick
could
discern
of
him
was
a
brown
curly
head
of
hair
carelessly
arranged
in
the
modern
mode
a
handsome
impudent
face
with
one
eye
closed
and
the
other
occupied
by
a
broken
through
which
as
a
substitute
for
a
lorgnette
the
individual
reconnoitered
him
a
cocked
hat
was
placed
in
a
very
manner
under
his
arm
and
he
held
an
ebony
cane
in
his
hand
very
much
in
the
style
of
a
as
the
french
have
it
of
the
present
day
this
glimpse
was
sufficient
to
satisfy
turpin
he
recognized
in
this
whimsical
personage
an
acquaintance
jerry
juniper
was
what
the
classical
captain
grose
would
designate
a
gentleman
with
three
outs
and
although
he
was
not
entirely
without
wit
nor
his
associates
avouched
without
money
nor
certainly
in
his
own
opinion
had
that
been
asked
without
manners
yet
was
he
assuredly
without
shoes
without
stockings
without
shirt
this
latter
deficiency
was
made
up
by
a
voluminous
cravat
tied
with
proportionately
large
bows
a
jaunty
pair
of
yellow
breeches
somewhat
faded
a
waistcoat
of
silver
brocade
richly
embroidered
somewhat
tarnished
and
a
velvet
coat
somewhat
chafed
completed
the
costume
of
this
beggar
brummell
this
mendicant
macaroni
jerry
juniper
was
a
character
well
known
at
the
time
as
a
constant
frequenter
of
all
races
fairs
regattas
and
all
of
which
he
attended
and
to
which
he
transported
himself
with
an
expedition
little
less
remarkable
than
that
of
turpin
you
met
him
at
epsom
at
ascot
at
newmarket
at
doncaster
at
the
roodee
of
chester
at
the
curragh
of
kildare
the
most
remote
as
well
as
the
most
adjacent
meeting
attracted
him
the
was
his
constant
haunt
and
in
more
senses
than
one
was
he
a
no
could
be
more
agile
more
nimble
scarcely
indeed
more
graceful
than
was
jerry
with
his
shoeless
and
stockingless
feet
and
the
manner
in
which
he
executed
a
pirouette
or
a
pas
before
a
line
of
carriages
seldom
failed
to
procure
him
golden
opinions
from
all
sorts
of
dames
with
the
ladies
it
must
be
owned
jerry
was
rather
upon
too
easy
terms
but
then
perhaps
the
ladies
were
upon
too
easy
terms
with
jerry
and
if
a
fair
one
condescended
to
jest
with
him
what
marvel
if
he
should
sometimes
slightly
transgress
the
laws
of
decorum
these
aberrations
however
were
trifling
altogether
he
was
so
well
known
and
knew
everybody
else
so
well
that
he
seldom
committed
himself
and
singular
to
say
could
on
occasions
even
be
serious
in
addition
to
his
other
faculties
no
one
cut
a
sly
joke
or
trolled
a
merry
ditty
better
than
jerry
his
peculiarities
in
short
were
on
the
pleasant
side
and
he
was
a
general
favorite
in
consequence
no
sooner
did
jerry
perceive
that
he
was
recognized
than
after
kissing
his
hand
with
the
air
of
a
to
the
highwayman
he
strove
to
edge
his
way
through
the
crowd
all
his
efforts
were
fruitless
and
tired
of
a
situation
in
the
rear
rank
so
inconsistent
he
conceived
with
his
own
importance
he
had
recourse
to
an
expedient
often
practised
with
success
in
harlequinades
and
not
unfrequently
in
real
life
where
a
flying
leap
is
occasionally
taken
over
our
heads
he
ran
back
a
few
yards
to
give
himself
an
impetus
returned
and
placing
his
hands
upon
the
shoulders
of
a
stalwart
vagabond
near
to
him
threw
a
summerset
upon
the
broad
cap
of
a
palliard
who
was
so
jammed
in
the
midst
that
he
could
not
have
stirred
to
avoid
the
shock
thence
without
pausing
he
vaulted
forwards
and
dropped
lightly
upon
the
ground
in
front
of
zoroaster
and
immediately
before
the
highwayman
dick
laughed
immoderately
at
jerry
manœuvre
he
shook
his
old
chum
cordially
by
the
hand
saying
in
a
whisper
what
the
devil
brings
you
here
jerry
i
might
retort
and
ask
you
that
question
captain
turpin
replied
jerry
it
is
odd
to
see
me
here
certainly
quite
out
of
my
element
lost
amongst
this
this
canting
crew
all
the
fault
of
a
pair
of
gipsy
eyes
bright
as
a
diamond
dark
as
a
sloe
you
comprehend
a
little
affair
ha
liable
to
these
things
bring
your
ear
closer
my
boy
be
upon
your
guard
keep
a
sharp
look
out
there
a
devil
of
a
reward
upon
your
head
i
wo
answer
for
all
those
rascals
thank
you
for
the
hint
jerry
replied
dick
in
the
same
tone
i
calculated
my
chances
pretty
nicely
when
i
came
here
but
if
i
should
perceive
any
symptoms
of
foul
play
any
attempt
to
snitch
or
nose
amongst
this
pack
of
peddlers
i
have
a
friend
or
two
at
hand
who
be
silent
upon
the
occasion
rest
assured
i
shall
have
my
eye
upon
the
gnarling
scoundrels
i
wo
be
sold
for
nothing
trust
you
for
that
returned
juniper
with
a
wink
stay
added
he
a
thought
strikes
me
i
have
a
scheme
which
may
perhaps
afford
you
some
fun
and
will
at
all
events
insure
your
safety
during
your
stay
what
is
it
asked
dick
just
amuse
yourself
with
a
flirtation
for
a
moment
or
two
with
that
pretty
damsel
who
has
been
casting
her
ogles
at
you
for
the
last
five
minutes
without
success
while
i
effect
a
and
as
turpin
nothing
loth
followed
his
advice
jerry
addressed
himself
to
zoroaster
after
a
little
conference
accompanied
by
that
worthy
and
the
knight
of
malta
the
trio
stepped
forward
from
the
line
and
approached
dick
when
juniper
assuming
some
such
attitude
as
our
admirable
jones
the
comedian
is
wont
to
display
delivered
himself
of
the
following
address
turpin
listened
with
the
gravity
of
one
of
the
distinguished
persons
alluded
to
at
the
commencement
of
the
present
chapter
upon
their
receiving
the
freedom
of
the
city
at
the
hands
of
a
mayor
and
corporation
thus
spoke
jerry
highest
of
rummest
of
rum
padders
and
most
scampish
of
scampsmen
we
in
the
name
of
barbara
our
most
tawny
queen
in
the
name
of
zoroaster
our
upright
man
dimber
damber
or
olli
campolli
by
all
which
titles
his
excellency
is
distinguished
in
our
own
respective
names
as
high
pads
and
low
pads
rum
gills
and
queer
gills
patricos
palliards
priggers
and
jarkmen
from
the
arch
rogue
to
the
needy
mizzler
fully
sensible
of
the
honor
you
have
conferred
upon
us
in
gracing
abbey
with
your
presence
and
conceiving
that
we
can
in
no
way
evince
our
sense
of
your
condescension
so
entirely
as
by
offering
you
the
freedom
of
our
crew
together
with
the
privileges
of
an
upright
man
which
you
may
be
aware
are
considerable
and
by
creating
you
an
honorary
member
of
the
vagrant
club
which
we
have
recently
established
and
in
so
doing
we
would
fain
express
the
sentiments
of
gratification
and
pride
which
we
experience
in
enrolling
among
our
members
one
who
has
extended
the
glory
of
roguery
so
widely
over
the
land
and
who
has
kicked
up
such
a
dust
upon
the
highways
of
england
as
most
effectually
to
blind
the
natives
one
who
is
in
himself
a
legion
of
highwaymen
awaiting
with
respectful
deference
the
acquiescence
of
captain
richard
turpin
we
beg
to
tender
him
the
freedom
of
our
crew
really
gentlemen
said
turpin
who
did
not
exactly
see
the
drift
of
this
harangue
you
do
me
a
vast
deal
of
honor
i
am
quite
at
a
loss
to
conceive
how
i
can
possibly
have
merited
so
much
attention
at
your
hands
and
indeed
i
feel
myself
so
unworthy
here
dick
received
an
expressive
wink
from
juniper
and
therefore
thought
it
prudent
to
alter
his
expression
could
i
suppose
myself
at
all
deserving
of
so
much
distinction
continued
the
modest
speaker
i
should
at
once
accept
your
very
obliging
offer
but
none
so
worthy
said
the
upright
man
ca
hear
of
a
refusal
said
the
knight
of
malta
refusal
impossible
reiterated
juniper
no
no
refusal
exclaimed
a
chorus
of
voices
dick
turpin
must
be
one
of
us
he
shall
be
our
dimber
damber
well
gentlemen
since
you
are
so
pressing
replied
turpin
even
so
be
it
i
be
your
dimber
damber
bravo
bravo
cried
the
mob
of
gentlemen
about
it
pals
at
once
said
the
knight
of
malta
flourishing
excalibur
by
thomas
à
becket
we
have
as
fine
a
scene
as
i
myself
ever
furnished
to
the
canterbury
lieges
about
what
asked
dick
your
matriculation
replied
jerry
there
are
certain
forms
to
be
gone
through
with
an
oath
to
be
taken
merely
a
trifle
we
have
a
jolly
booze
when
all
over
come
bing
avast
my
merry
pals
to
the
green
to
the
green
a
turpin
a
turpin
a
new
brother
a
turpin
a
turpin
a
new
brother
echoed
the
crew
i
brought
you
through
said
jerry
taking
advantage
of
the
uproar
that
ensued
to
whisper
to
his
chum
none
of
them
will
dare
to
lift
a
finger
against
you
now
they
are
all
your
friends
for
life
nevertheless
returned
turpin
i
should
be
glad
to
know
what
has
become
of
bess
if
it
your
prancer
you
are
wanting
chirped
a
fluttering
creature
whom
turpin
recognized
as
luke
groom
grasshopper
i
gave
her
a
fresh
loaf
and
a
stoup
of
stingo
as
you
bade
me
and
there
she
be
under
yon
tree
as
quiet
as
a
lamb
i
see
her
replied
turpin
just
tighten
her
girths
grasshopper
and
bring
her
after
me
and
thou
shalt
have
wherewithal
to
chirp
over
thy
cups
at
supper
away
bounded
the
elfin
dwarf
to
execute
his
behest
a
loud
shout
now
rent
the
skies
and
presently
afterwards
was
heard
the
vile
scraping
of
a
fiddle
accompanied
by
the
tattoo
of
a
drum
approaching
turpin
a
host
of
gipsies
elevated
the
highwayman
upon
their
shoulders
and
in
this
way
he
was
carried
to
the
centre
of
the
green
where
the
long
oaken
table
which
had
once
served
the
franciscans
for
refection
was
now
destined
for
the
stage
of
the
pageant
upon
this
table
three
drums
were
placed
and
turpin
was
requested
to
seat
himself
on
the
central
one
a
solemn
prelude
more
unearthly
than
the
incantation
in
the
freyschütz
was
played
by
the
orchestra
of
the
band
conducted
by
the
paganini
of
the
place
who
elicited
the
most
marvellous
notes
from
his
shell
a
couple
of
shawms
emitted
sepulchral
sounds
while
the
hollow
rolling
of
a
drum
broke
ever
and
anon
upon
the
ear
the
effect
was
prodigiously
fine
during
this
overture
the
patrico
and
the
upright
man
had
ascended
the
rostrum
each
taking
his
place
the
former
on
the
right
hand
of
turpin
the
latter
upon
his
left
below
them
stood
the
knight
of
malta
with
excalibur
drawn
in
his
hand
and
gleaming
in
the
sunshine
on
the
whole
dick
was
amused
with
what
he
saw
and
with
the
novel
situation
in
which
he
found
himself
placed
around
the
table
were
congregated
a
compact
mass
of
heads
so
compact
indeed
that
they
looked
like
one
creature
an
argus
with
each
eye
upturned
upon
the
highwayman
the
idea
struck
turpin
that
the
restless
mass
of
shreds
and
patches
of
vivid
hues
and
varied
tintings
singularly
though
accidentally
disposed
to
produce
such
an
effect
resembled
an
immense
or
it
might
be
a
turkey
carpet
spread
out
upon
the
grass
the
scene
was
a
joyous
one
it
was
a
brilliant
sunshiny
morning
freshened
and
purified
by
the
storm
of
the
preceding
night
the
air
breathed
a
balm
upon
the
nerves
and
senses
of
the
robber
the
wooded
hills
were
glittering
in
light
the
brook
was
flowing
swiftly
past
the
edge
of
the
verdant
slope
glancing
like
a
wreathed
snake
in
the
sunshine
its
quiet
song
lost
in
the
rude
harmony
of
the
mummers
as
were
the
thousand
twitterings
of
the
rejoicing
birds
the
rocks
bared
their
bosoms
to
the
sun
or
were
buried
in
gloom
the
shadows
of
the
pillars
and
arches
of
the
old
walls
of
the
priory
were
projected
afar
while
the
ramifications
of
the
magnificent
marigold
window
were
traced
as
if
by
a
pencil
upon
the
verdant
tablet
of
the
sod
the
overture
was
finished
with
the
appearance
of
the
principal
figures
in
this
strange
picture
the
reader
is
already
familiar
it
remains
only
to
give
him
some
idea
of
the
patrico
imagine
then
an
old
superannuated
goat
reared
upon
its
hind
legs
and
clad
in
a
white
sheet
disposed
in
folds
like
those
of
a
simar
about
its
limbs
and
you
will
have
some
idea
of
balthazar
the
patrico
this
resemblance
to
the
animal
before
mentioned
was
rendered
the
more
striking
by
his
huge
hanging
under
lip
his
lengthy
white
beard
and
a
sort
of
cap
covering
his
head
which
was
ornamented
with
a
pair
of
horns
such
as
are
to
be
seen
in
michael
angelo
tremendous
statue
of
moses
balthazar
besides
being
the
patrico
of
the
tribe
was
its
principal
professor
of
divination
and
had
been
the
and
faithful
minister
of
barbara
lovel
from
whose
secret
instructions
he
was
supposed
to
have
derived
much
of
his
magical
skill
placing
a
pair
of
spectacles
upon
his
prognosticating
nose
and
unrolling
a
vellum
skin
upon
which
strange
characters
were
written
balthazar
turning
to
turpin
thus
commenced
in
a
solemn
voice
thou
who
wouldst
our
brother
be
say
how
we
shall
enter
thee
name
the
name
that
thou
wilt
bear
ere
our
livery
thou
wear
i
see
no
reason
why
i
should
alter
my
designation
replied
the
noviciate
but
as
popes
change
their
titles
on
their
creation
there
can
be
no
objection
to
a
scampsman
following
so
excellent
an
example
let
me
be
known
as
the
night
hawk
the

returned
the
hierophant
proceeding
to

parchment

down
continued
he
after
some
hesitation
turpin
complied
you
must
repeat
the
or
oath
of
our
creed
after
my
dictation
said
the
patrico
and
turpin
signifying
his
assent
by
a
nod
balthazar
propounded
the
following
abjuration
oath
of
the
canting
crew
i

repeated
turpin
with
emphasis
zoroaster
said
the
patrico
to
the
upright
man
do
thy
part
of
this
ceremonial
zoroaster
obeyed
and
taking
excalibur
from
the
knight
of
malta
bestowed
a
hearty
thwack
with
the
blade
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
kneeling
highwayman
assisting
him
afterwards
to
arise
the
inauguration
was
complete
well
exclaimed
dick
i
glad
it
all
over
my
leg
feels
a
little
stiffish
i
not
much
given
to
kneeling
i
must
dance
it
off
saying
which
he
began
to
shuffle
upon
the
boards
i
tell
you
what
continued
he
most
reverend
patrico
that
same
of
yours
has
a
cursed
long
tail
i
could
scarce
swallow
it
all
and
it
strange
if
it
give
me
an
indigestion
as
to
you
sage
zory
from
the
dexterity
with
which
you
flourish
your
sword
i
should
say
you
had
practised
at
court
his
majesty
could
scarce
do
the
thing
better
when
slapping
some
fat
alderman
upon
the
shoulder
he
bids
him
arise
sir
richard
and
now
pals
added
he
glancing
round
as
i
am
one
of
you
let
have
a
booze
together
ere
i
depart
for
i
do
think
my
stay
will
be
long
in
the
land
of
egypt
this
suggestion
of
turpin
was
so
entirely
consonant
to
the
wishes
of
the
assemblage
that
it
met
with
universal
approbation
and
upon
a
sign
from
zoroaster
some
of
his
followers
departed
in
search
of
supplies
for
the
carousal
zoroaster
leaped
from
the
table
and
his
example
was
followed
by
turpin
and
more
leisurely
by
the
patrico
it
was
rather
early
in
the
day
for
a
drinking
bout
but
the
canting
crew
were
not
remarkably
particular
the
chairs
were
removed
and
the
jingling
of
glasses
announced
the
arrival
of
the
preliminaries
of
the
matutine
symposion
poles
canvas
and
cords
were
next
brought
and
in
almost
as
short
a
space
of
time
as
one
scene
is
substituted
for
another
in
a
theatrical
representation
a
tent
was
erected
benches
stools
and
chairs
appeared
with
equal
celerity
and
the
interior
soon
presented
an
appearance
like
that
of
a
booth
at
a
fair
a
keg
of
brandy
was
broached
and
the
health
of
the
new
brother
quaffed
in
brimmers
our
highwayman
returned
thanks
zoroaster
was
in
the
chair
the
knight
of
malta
acting
as
croupier
a
second
toast
was
proposed
the
tawny
queen
this
was
drunk
with
a
like
enthusiasm
and
with
a
like
allowance
of
the
potent
spirit
but
as
bumpers
of
brandy
are
not
to
be
repeated
with
impunity
it
became
evident
to
the
president
of
the
board
that
he
must
not
repeat
his
toasts
quite
so
expeditiously
to
create
a
temporary
diversion
therefore
he
called
for
a
song
the
dulcet
notes
of
the
fiddle
now
broke
through
the
clamor
and
in
answer
to
the
call
jerry
juniper
volunteered
the
following
jerry
juniper
chant
in
a
box
of
the
stone
jug
i
was
born
of
a
hempen
widow
the
kid
forlorn
away
and
my
father
as
i
heard
say
was

of
capers
gay
who
cut
his
last
fling
with
great
applause

doll
pals

who
cut
his
last
fling
with
great
applause
to
the
tune
of
a
hearty
choke
with
caper
sauce
the
knucks
in
quod
did
my
schoolmen
play
away
and
put
me
up
to
the
time
of
day
until
at
last
there
was
none
so
knowing
my
doll
pals
fake
until
at
last
there
was
none
so
knowing
no
such
sneaksman
or
buzgloak
going
fogles
and
fawnies
soon
went
their
way
to
the
spout
with
the
sneezers
in
grand
array
no
dummy

had
forks
so
fly
my
doll

a
reader
like
me
in
the
lay
soon
then
i
mounted
in
high
my
doll
pals
fake
soon
then
i
mounted
in
high
and
sported
my
flashiest
toggery
firmly
resolved
i
would
make
my
hay
away
while
mercury
star
shed
a
single
ray
and
was
there
seen
such
a
dashing
prig
my
doll
pals
fake
and
was
there
seen
such
a
dashing
prig
with
my
strummel
faked
in
the
newest
twig
with
my
fawnied
famms
and
my
onions
gay
away
my
thimble
of
ridge
and
my
driz
kemesa
all
my
togs
were
so
niblike
and
splash
my
doll
pals
fake
all
my
togs
were
so
niblike
and
splash
readily
the
queer
screens
i
then
could
smash
but
my
nuttiest
blowen
one
fine
day
away
to
the
beaks
did
her
fancy
man
betray
and
thus
was
i
bowled
out
at
last
my
doll
pals
fake
and
thus
was
i
bowled
out
at
last
and
into
the
jug
for
a
lag
was
cast
but
i
slipped
my
darbies
one
morn
in
may
away
and
gave
to

a
holiday
and
here
i

a
regular
rollicking
romany
my
doll
pals

much
laughter
and
applause
rewarded
jerry
attempt
to
please
and
though
the
meaning
of
his
chant
even
with
the
aid
of
the
numerous
notes
appended
to
it
may
not
be
quite
obvious
to
our
readers
we
can
assure
them
that
it
was
perfectly
intelligible
to
the
canting
crew
jerry
was
now
entitled
to
a
call
and
happening
at
the
moment
to
meet
the
fine
dark
eyes
of
a
sentimental
gipsy
one
of
that
better
class
of
mendicants
who
wandered
about
the
country
with
a
guitar
at
his
back
his
election
fell
upon
him
the
youth
without
prelude
struck
up
a
gipsy
serenade
merry
maid
merry
maid
wilt
thou
wander
with
me
we
will
roam
through
the
forest
the
meadow
and
lea
we
will
haunt
the
sunny
bowers
and
when
day
begins
to
flee
our
couch
shall
be
the
ferny
brake
our
canopy
the
tree
maid
merry
maid
come
and
wander
with
me
no
life
like
the
gipsy
so
joyous
and
free
merry
maid
merry
maid
though
a
roving
life
be
ours
we
will
laugh
away
the
laughing
and
quickly
fleeting
hours
our
hearts
are
free
as
is
the
free
and
open
sky
above
and
we
know
what
tamer
souls
know
not
how
lovers
ought
to
love
maid
merry
maid
come
and
wander
with
me
no
life
like
the
gipsy
so
joyous
and
free
zoroaster
now
removed
the
pipe
from
his
upright
lips
to
intimate
his
intention
of
proposing
a
toast
a
universal
knocking
of
knuckles
by
the
knucklers
was
followed
by
profound
silence
the
sage
spoke
the
city
of
canterbury
pals
said
he
and
may
it
never
want
a
knight
of
malta
the
toast
was
pledged
with
much
laughter
and
in
many
bumpers
the
knight
upon
whom
all
eyes
were
turned
rose
with
stately
bearing
and
majestic
motion
to
return
thanks
i
return
you
an
infinitude
of
thanks
brother
pals
said
he
glancing
round
the
assemblage
and
bowing
to
the
president
and
to
you
most
upright
zory
for
the
honor
you
have
done
me
in
associating
my
name
with
that
city
believe
me
i
sincerely
appreciate
the
compliment
and
echo
the
sentiment
from
the
bottom
of
my
soul
i
trust
it
never
want
a
knight
of
malta
in
return
for
your
consideration
but
a
poor
one
you
will
say
you
shall
have
a
ditty
which
i
composed
upon
the
occasion
of
my
pilgrimage
to
that
city
and
which
i
have
thought
proper
to
name
after
myself
the
knight
of
malta
canterbury
come
list
to
me
and
you
shall
have
without
a
hem
or
haw
sirs
a
canterbury
pilgrimage
much
better
than
old
chaucer
is
of
a
hoax
i
once
played
off
upon
that
city
clever
the
memory
of
which
i
hope
will
stick
to
it
for
ever
my
beard
and
purple
cloak
and
castor
for
the
knight
of
malta
to
execute
my
purpose
in
the
first
place
you
must
know
sirs
my
locks
i
let
hang
down
my
neck
my
beard
and
whiskers
grow
sirs
a
purple
cloak
i
next
clapped
on
a
sword
lagged
to
my
side
sirs
and
mounted
on
a
charger
black
i
to
the
town
did
ride
sirs
my
beard
two
pages
were
there
by
my
side
upon
two
little
ponies
decked
out
in
scarlet
uniform
as
spruce
as
macaronies
caparisoned
my
charger
was
as
grandly
as
his
master
and
my
long
and
curly
locks
i
wore
a
castor
my
beard
the
people
all
flocked
forth
amazed
to
see
a
man
so
hairy
oh
i
such
a
sight
had
before
been
seen
in
canterbury
my
flowing
robe
my
flowing
beard
my
horse
with
flowing
mane
sirs
they
stared
the
days
of
chivalry
they
thought
were
come
again
sirs
my
beard
i
told
them
a
long
rigmarole
romance
that
did
not
halt
a
jot
that
they
beheld
in
me
a
real
knight
of
malta
tom
à
becket
had
i
sworn
i
was
that
saint
and
martyr
hallowed
i
doubt
not
just
as
readily
the
bait
they
would
have
swallowed
my
beard
i
rode
about
and
speechified
and
everybody
gullied
the
diddled
and
the
magistracy
bullied
like
puppets
were
the
townsfolk
led
in
that
show
they
call
a
raree
the
gotham
sages
were
a
joke
to
those
of
canterbury
my
beard
the
theatre
i
next
engaged
where
i
addressed
the
crowd
sirs
and
on
retrenchment
and
reform
i
spouted
long
and
loud
sirs
on
tithes
and
on
taxation
i
enlarged
with
skill
and
zeal
sirs
who
so
able
as
a
malta
knight
the
malt
tax
to
repeal
sirs
my
beard
as
a
candidate
i
then
stepped
forth
to
represent
their
city
and
my
to
that
place
was
certainly
a
pity
for
surely
i
the
fittest
was
and
very
proper
very
to
represent
the
wisdom
and
the
wit
of
canterbury
my
beard
at
the
trial
of
some
smugglers
next
one
thing
i
rather
queer
did
and
the
justices
upon
the
bench
i
literally
for
i
swore
that
i
some
casks
did
see
though
proved
as
clear
as
day
sirs
that
i
happened
at
the
time
to
be
some
fifty
miles
away
sirs
my
beard
this
last
assertion
i
must
own
was
somewhat
of
a
blunder
and
for
perjury
indicted
they
compelled
me
to
knock
under
to
my
prosperous
career
this
slight
error
put
a
stop
sirs
and
thus
the
knight
of
malta
was
at
length
obliged
to
sirs
his
beard
and
purple
cloak
and
castor
to
the
knight
of
the
knight
sat
down
amidst
the
general
plaudits
of
the
company
the
party
meanwhile
had
been
increased
by
the
arrival
of
luke
and
the
sexton
the
former
who
was
in
no
mood
for
revelry
refused
to
comply
with
his
grandsire
solicitation
to
enter
and
remained
sullenly
at
the
door
with
his
arms
folded
and
his
eyes
fixed
upon
turpin
whose
movements
he
commanded
through
the
canvas
aperture
the
sexton
walked
up
to
dick
who
was
seated
at
the
post
of
honor
and
clapping
him
upon
the
shoulder
congratulated
him
upon
the
comfortable
position

three
appropriate
as
this
sentiment
was
it
did
not
appear
to
be
so
inviting
to
the
party
as
might
have
been
anticipated
and
the
shouts
soon
died
away
they
like
not
the
thoughts
of
the
gallows
said
turpin
to
peter
more
fools
they
a
mere
bugbear
to
frighten
children
believe
me
and
never
yet
alarmed
a
brave
man
the
gallows
pshaw
one
can
but
die
once
and
what
signifies
it
how
so
that
it
be
over
quickly
i
think
no
more
of
the
last
leap
into
eternity
than
clearing
a
gate
a
end
for
it
so
let
us
be
merry
and
make
the
most
of
our
time
and
that
true
philosophy
i
know
you
can
throw
off

he
turning
to

i
heard
you
sing
last
night
at
the

a

my

in

tip
me
a

of

if

a

of
you
are
brewing
sir
william
added
he
addressing
the
knight
of
malta
you
may
send
me
a
jorum
at
your
convenience
jerry
handed
the
highwayman
a
pipe
together
with
a
tumbler
of
the
beverage
which
the
knight
had
prepared
which
he
pronounced
excellent
and
while
the
huge
bowl
was
passed
round
to
the
company
a
prelude
of
shawms
announced
that
peter
was
ready
to
break
into
song
accordingly
after
the
symphony
was
ended
accompanied
at
intervals
by
a
single
instrument
peter
began
his
melody
in
a
key
so
high
that
the
utmost
exertions
of
the
failed
to
approach
its
altitudes
the
burden
of
his
minstrelsy
was
the
mandrake

the

are
its

to
see
green

as
the

though

anathema

at

astonishment
prevailed
amongst
the
crew
luke
himself
had
been
taken
by
surprise
when
turpin
discovered
him
at
the
door
of
the
tent
and
summoned
him
to
appear
he
reluctantly
complied
with
the
request
but
when
in
a
vein
dick
began
to
rally
him
upon
his
pretensions
he
would
most
gladly
have
retreated
had
it
been
in
his
power
it
was
then
too
late
he
felt
he
must
stand
the
ordeal
every
eye
was
fixed
upon
him
with
a
look
of
inquiry
zoroaster
took
his
everlasting
pipe
from
his
mouth
this
ai
true
asked
the
perplexed
magus
he
has
said
it
replied
luke
i
may
not
deny
it
this
was
sufficient
there
was
a
wild
hubbub

amongst
the

jerry

we

the

oliver

forth
to
the

is
the
scampsman
gone
his
matchless
prancer
riding
merrily
over
the

he
flies
fast

as

dick
who
began
to
feel
the
influence
of
these
morning
cups
i
vote
that
we
adjourn
believe
me
i
shall
always
bear
in
mind
that
i
am
a
brother
of
your
band
sir
luke
and
i
must
have
a
little
chat
together
ere
i
take
my
leave
adieu
and
taking
luke
by
the
arm
he
walked
out
of
the
tent
peter
bradley
rose
and
followed
them
at
the
door
they
found
the
dwarfish
grasshopper
with
black
bess
rewarding
the
urchin
for
his
trouble
and
slipping
the
bridle
of
his
mare
over
his
hand
turpin
continued
his
walk
over
the
green
for
a
few
minutes
he
seemed
to
be
lost
in
rumination
i
tell
you
what
sir
luke
said
he
i
should
like
to
do
a
generous
thing
and
make
you
a
present
of
this
bit
of
paper
but
one
ought
not
to
throw
away
one
luck
you
know
there
is
a
tide
in
the
affairs
of
thieves
as
the
player
coves
say
which
must
be
taken
at
the
flood
or
else
no
matter
your
old
dad
sir
piers
god
help
him
had
the
gingerbread
i
know
he
was
as
we
say
a
regular
cull
you
wo
feel
a
few
thousands
especially
at
starting
and
besides
there
are
two
others
rust
and
wilder
who
row
in
the
same
boat
with
me
and
must
therefore
come
in
for
their
share
of
the
all
this
considered
you
ca
complain
i
think
if
i
ask
five
thousand
for
it
that
old
harridan
lady
rookwood
offered
me
nearly
as
much
i
will
not
talk
to
you
of
fairness
said
luke
i
will
not
say
that
document
belongs
of
right
to
me
it
fell
by
accident
into
your
hands
having
possessed
yourself
of
it
i
blame
you
not
that
you
dispose
of
it
to
the
best
advantage
i
must
perforce
agree
to
your
terms
oh
no
replied
dick
it
quite
optional
lady
rookwood
will
give
as
much
and
make
no
mouths
about
it
soho
lass
what
makes
bess
prick
her
ears
in
that
fashion
ha
in
the
distance
that
jade
knows
the
sound
as
well
as
i
do
i
just
see
what
it
like
you
will
have
ten
minutes
for
reflection
who
knows
if
i
may
not
have
come
in
for
a
good
thing
here
at
that
instant
the
carriage
passed
the
angle
of
a
rock
some
three
hundred
yards
distant
and
was
seen
slowly
ascending
the
eager
as
a
hawk
after
his
quarry
turpin
dashed
after
it
in
vain
the
sexton
whom
he
nearly
overthrew
in
his
career
called
after
him
to
halt
he
sped
like
a
bolt
from
the
bow
may
the
devil
break
his
neck
cried
peter
as
he
saw
him
dash
through
the
brook
could
he
not
let
them
alone
this
must
not
be
said
luke
know
you
whose
carriage
it
is
it
is
a
shrine
that
holds
the
jewel
that
should
be
dearest
in
your
eyes
returned
peter
haste
and
arrest
the
spoiler
hand
whom
do
you
mean
asked
luke
eleanor
mowbray
replied
peter
she
is
there
to
the
rescue
away
eleanor
mowbray
echoed
luke
and
sybil
at
this
instant
a
was
heard
will
you
let
murder
be
done
and
upon
your
cousin
cried
peter
with
a
bitter
look
you
are
not
what
i
took
you
for
luke
answered
not
but
swift
as
the
hound
freed
from
the
leash
darted
in
the
direction
of
the
carriage
mischiefs
are
like
the
visits
of
franciscan
friars
they
never
come
to
prey
upon
us
single
law
the
course
of
our
tale
returns
now
to
eleanor
mowbray
after
she
had
parted
from
ranulph
rookwood
and
had
watched
him
disappear
beneath
the
arches
of
the
church
porch
her
heart
sank
and
drawing
herself
back
within
the
carriage
she
became
a
prey
to
the
most
poignant
affliction
in
vain
she
endeavored
to
shake
off
this
feeling
of
desolation
it
would
not
be
despair
had
taken
possession
of
her
the
magic
fabric
of
delight
melted
away
or
only
gleamed
to
tantalize
at
an
unreachable
distance
a
presentiment
that
ranulph
would
never
be
hers
had
taken
root
in
her
imagination
and
overshadowed
all
the
rest
while
eleanor
pursued
this
train
of
reflection
the
time
insensibly
wore
away
until
the
sudden
stoppage
of
the
carriage
aroused
the
party
from
their
meditation
major
mowbray
perceived
that
the
occasion
of
the
halt
was
the
rapid
advance
of
a
horseman
who
was
nearing
them
at
full
speed
the
appearance
of
the
rider
was
somewhat
singular
and
might
have
created
some
uneasiness
as
to
the
nature
of
his
approach
had
not
the
major
immediately
recognized
a
friend
he
was
nevertheless
greatly
surprised
to
see
him
and
turned
to
mowbray
to
inform
her
that
father
ambrose
to
his
infinite
astonishment
was
coming
to
meet
them
and
appeared
from
his
manner
to
be
the
bearer
of
unwelcome
tidings
father
ambrose
was
perhaps
the
only
being
whom
eleanor
disliked
she
had
felt
an
unaccountable
antipathy
towards
him
which
she
could
neither
extirpate
nor
control
during
their
long
and
close
intimacy
it
may
be
necessary
to
mention
that
her
religious
culture
had
been
in
accordance
with
the
tenets
of
the
romish
church
in
whose
faith
the
faith
of
her
ancestry
her
mother
had
continued
and
that
father
ambrose
with
whom
she
had
first
become
acquainted
during
the
residence
of
the
family
near
bordeaux
was
her
ghostly
adviser
and
confessor
an
englishman
by
birth
he
had
been
appointed
pastor
to
the
diocese
in
which
they
dwelt
and
was
consequently
a
frequent
visitor
almost
a
constant
inmate
of
the
château
yet
though
duty
and
respect
would
have
prompted
her
to
regard
the
father
with
affection
eleanor
could
never
conquer
the
feelings
of
dislike
and
distrust
which
she
had
at
first
entertained
towards
him
a
dislike
which
was
increased
by
the
strange
control
in
which
he
seemed
to
hold
her
mother
who
regarded
him
with
a
veneration
approaching
to
infatuation
it
was
therefore
with
satisfaction
that
she
bade
him
adieu
he
had
however
followed
his
friends
to
england
under
a
feigned
name
as
being
a
recusant
romish
priest
and
supposed
to
have
been
engaged
in
certain
jesuitical
plots
his
return
to
his
own
country
was
attended
with
considerable
risk
and
had
now
remained
domesticated
with
them
for
some
months
that
he
had
been
in
some
way
in
early
life
connected
with
a
branch
of
the
house
of
rookwood
eleanor
was
aware
she
fancied
he
might
have
been
engaged
in
political
intrigue
with
sir
reginald
which
would
have
well
accorded
with
his
ardent
ambitious
temperament
and
the
knowledge
of
this
circumstance
made
her
doubly
apprehensive
lest
the
nature
of
his
present
communication
should
have
reference
to
her
lover
towards
whose
cause
the
father
had
never
been
favorable
and
respecting
whose
situation
he
might
have
made
some
discovery
which
she
feared
he
might
use
to
ranulph
disadvantage
wrapped
in
a
long
black
cloak
with
a
hat
drawn
closely
over
his
brows
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
further
of
the
figure
and
features
beyond
the
circumstance
of
his
height
which
was
remarkable
until
he
had
reached
the
carriage
window
when
raising
his
hat
he
disclosed
a
head
that
titian
might
have
painted
and
which
arising
from
the
dark
drapery
looked
not
unlike
the
visage
of
some
grave
and
saturnine
venetian
there
was
a
venerable
expanse
of
forehead
thinly
scattered
with
hair
towering
over
black
brows
which
in
their
turn
shadowed
keen
penetrating
eyes
the
temples
were
hollow
and
blue
veins
might
be
traced
beneath
the
sallow
skin
the
were
high
and
there
was
something
in
the
face
that
spoke
of
while
the
thin
livid
lips
closely
compressed
and
the
austere
and
sinister
expression
of
his
countenance
showed
that
his
if
he
had
ever
practised
it
had
scarcely
prostrated
the
demon
of
pride
whose
dominion
might
still
be
traced
in
the
lines
and
furrows
of
his
haughty
physiognomy
the
father
looked
at
mowbray
and
then
glanced
suspiciously
at
eleanor
the
former
appeared
to
understand
him
you
would
say
a
word
to
me
in
private
said
mowbray
shall
i
descend
the
priest
bowed
assent
it
is
not
to
you
alone
that
my
mission
extends
said
he
gravely
you
are
all
in
part
concerned
your
son
had
better
alight
with
you
instantly
replied
the
major
if
you
will
give
your
horse
in
charge
to
the
postilion
we
will
attend
you
at
once
with
a
feeling
of
renewed
apprehension
connected
she
knew
not
why
with
ranulph
eleanor
beheld
her
relatives
descend
from
the
carriage
and
in
the
hope
of
gaining
some
clue
from
their
gestures
to
the
subject
of
their
conversation
she
watched
their
motions
as
narrowly
as
her
situation
permitted
from
the
earnest
manner
of
the
priest
and
the
interest
his
narrative
seemed
to
excite
in
his
hearers
it
was
evident
that
his
communication
was
of
importance
presently
accompanied
by
father
ambrose
mowbray
returned
to
the
carriage
while
the
major
mounting
the
priest
horse
after
bidding
a
hasty
adieu
to
his
sister
adding
with
a
look
that
belied
the
consolation
intended
to
be
conveyed
by
his
words
that
all
was
well
but
without
staying
to
offer
her
any
explanation
of
the
cause
of
his
sudden
departure
rode
back
the
way
they
had
just
traversed
and
in
the
direction
of
rookwood
bereft
of
the
only
person
to
whom
she
could
have
applied
for
information
though
dying
with
curiosity
and
anxiety
to
know
the
meaning
of
this
singular
interview
and
of
the
sudden
change
of
plans
which
she
felt
so
intimately
concerned
herself
eleanor
was
constrained
to
preserve
silence
as
after
their
entrance
into
the
carriage
her
mother
again
seemed
lost
in
painful
reflection
and
heeded
her
not
and
the
father
drawing
from
his
pocket
a
small
volume
appeared
intently
occupied
in
its
perusal
dear
mother
said
eleanor
at
length
turning
to
mowbray
my
brother
is
gone
to
rookwood
said
mowbray
in
a
tone
calculated
to
check
further
inquiry
but
eleanor
was
too
anxious
to
notice
it
and
wherefore
mother
said
she
may
i
not
be
informed
not
as
yet
my
child
not
as
yet
replied
mowbray
you
will
learn
all
sufficiently
early
the
priest
raised
his
eyes
from
the
book
to
watch
the
effect
of
this
speech
and
dropped
them
instantly
as
eleanor
turned
towards
him
she
had
been
about
to
appeal
to
him
but
having
witnessed
this
look
she
relinquished
her
purpose
and
endeavored
to
divert
her
tristful
thoughts
by
gazing
through
the
glimmering
medium
of
her
tears
upon
the
soothing
aspect
of
external
nature
that
aspect
which
in
sunshine
or
in
storm
has
ever
relief
in
store
for
a
heart
embittered
by
the
stormy
coldness
of
the
world
the
road
meanwhile
led
them
through
a
long
woody
valley
and
was
now
climbing
the
sides
of
a
steep
hill
they
were
soon
in
the
vicinity
of
the
priory
and
of
the
gipsies
encampment
the
priest
leaned
forward
and
whispered
something
in
mowbray
ear
who
looked
towards
the
ruined
shrine
part
of
the
mouldering
walls
being
visible
from
the
road
at
the
moment
the
clatter
of
a
horse
hoofs
and
the
sound
of
a
loud
voice
commanding
the
postilion
in
a
menacing
tone
to
stop
accompanied
by
a
volley
of
imprecations
interrupted
the
conference
and
bespoke
the
approach
of
an
unwelcome
intruder
and
one
whom
all
too
truly
feared
would
not
be
readily
dismissed
the
postilion
did
his
best
to
rid
them
of
the
assailant
perceiving
a
masked
horseman
behind
him
approaching
at
a
furious
rate
he
had
little
doubt
as
to
his
intentions
and
turpin
for
it
was
our
highwayman
soon
made
his
doubts
certainties
he
hallooed
to
him
to
stop
but
the
fellow
paid
no
attention
to
his
command
and
disregarded
even
the
pistol
which
he
saw
in
a
casual
glimpse
over
his
near
side
presented
at
his
person
clapping
spurs
into
his
horse
flanks
he
sought
succor
in
flight
turpin
was
by
his
side
in
an
instant
as
the
highwayman
endeavored
to
catch
his
reins
the
lad
suddenly
wheeled
the
carriage
right
upon
him
and
but
for
the
dexterity
of
turpin
and
the
clever
conduct
of
his
mare
would
inevitably
have
crushed
him
against
the
roadside
as
it
was
his
left
leg
was
slightly
grazed
irritated
at
this
turpin
fired
over
the
man
head
and
with
the
of
the
pistol
felled
him
from
his
seat
startled
by
the
sound
and
no
longer
under
the
governance
of
their
rider
the
horses
rushed
with
frantic
violence
towards
a
ditch
that
bounded
the
other
side
of
the
highway
down
which
the
carriage
was
precipitated
and
at
once
overturned
turpin
first
act
after
he
had
ascertained
that
no
mischief
had
been
occasioned
to
those
within
beyond
the
alarm
incident
to
the
shock
was
to
compel
the
postilion
who
had
by
this
time
gained
his
legs
to
release
the
horses
from
their
traces
this
done
with
the
best
grace
he
could
assume
and
adjusting
his
mask
he
opened
the
carriage
and
proceeded
to
liberate
the
captives
beg
pardon
said
he
as
soon
as
he
had
released
mowbray
excessively
sorry
upon
my
soul
to
have
been
the
cause
of
so
much
unnecessary
alarm
to
you
all
the
fault
i
assure
you
of
that
rascal
of
a
postilion
had
the
fellow
only
pulled
up
when
i
commanded
him
this
botheration
might
have
been
avoided
you
will
remember
that
when
you
pay
him
all
his
fault
i
assure
you
receiving
no
reply
he
proceeded
to
extricate
eleanor
with
whose
beauty
the
inflammable
highwayman
was
instantly
smitten
leaving
the
father
to
shift
for
himself
he
turned
to
address
some
observation
of
coarse
gallantry
to
her
but
she
eluded
his
grasp
and
flew
to
her
side
it
is
useless
sir
said
mowbray
as
turpin
drew
near
them
to
affect
ignorance
of
your
intentions
you
have
already
occasioned
us
serious
alarm
much
delay
and
inconvenience
i
trust
therefore
that
beyond
our
purses
to
which
though
scantily
supplied
you
are
welcome
we
shall
sustain
no
molestation
you
seem
to
have
less
of
the
ruffian
about
you
than
the
rest
of
your
lawless
race
and
are
not
i
should
hope
destitute
of
common
humanity
common
humanity
replied
turpin
bless
you
i
the
most
humane
creature
breathing
would
not
hurt
a
fly
much
less
a
lady
incivility
was
never
laid
to
my
charge
this
business
may
be
managed
in
a
few
seconds
and
as
soon
as
we
have
settled
the
matter
i
lend
your
stupid
a
hand
to
put
the
horses
to
the
carriage
again
and
get
the
wheels
out
of
the
ditch
you
have
a
banker
i
suppose
in
town
perhaps
in
the
country
but
i
do
like
country
bankers
besides
i
want
a
little
ready
cash
in
rumville
beg
pardon
london
i
mean
my
ears
have
been
so
stunned
with
those
romany
patterers
i
almost
in
flash
just
draw
me
a
check
i
pen
and
ink
always
ready
a
check
for
fifty
pounds
only
fifty
what
your
name
i
blank
checks
of
all
the
best
houses
in
my
pocket
that
and
a
kiss
from
the
pretty
lips
of
that
maid
winking
to
eleanor
will
fully
content
me
you
see
you
have
neither
an
exorbitant
nor
uncivil
personage
to
deal
with
eleanor
shrank
closer
towards
her
mother
exhausted
by
previous
agitation
of
the
night
greatly
frightened
by
the
shock
which
she
had
just
sustained
and
still
more
alarmed
by
the
words
and
gestures
of
the
highwayman
she
felt
that
she
was
momentarily
in
danger
of
fainting
and
with
difficulty
prevented
herself
from
falling
the
priest
who
had
succeeded
in
freeing
himself
from
the
carriage
now
placed
himself
between
turpin
and
the
ladies
be
satisfied
misguided
man
said
the
father
in
a
stern
voice
offering
a
purse
which
mowbray
hastily
extended
towards
him
with
the
crime
you
have
already
committed
and
seek
not
to
peril
your
soul
by
deeper
guilt
be
content
with
the
plunder
you
now
obtain
and
depart
for
by
my
holy
calling
i
affirm
to
you
that
if
you
advance
one
footstep
towards
the
further
molestation
of
these
ladies
it
shall
be
at
the
hazard
of
your
life
bravo
exclaimed
turpin
now
this
is
what
i
like
who
would
have
thought
the
old
had
so
much
pluck
in
him
sir
i
commend
you
for
your
courage
but
you
are
mistaken
i
am
the
quietest
man
breathing
and
never
harm
a
human
being
in
proof
of
which
only
look
at
your
rascal
of
a
postilion
whom
any
one
of
my
friends
would
have
sent
to
the
devil
for
half
the
trouble
he
gave
me
easy
as
i
am
i
never
choose
to
be
balked
in
my
humors
i
must
have
the
fifty
and
the
buss
and
then
i
off
as
soon
as
you
like
and
i
may
as
well
have
the
kiss
while
the
old
lady
signs
the
check
and
then
we
shall
have
the
seal
as
well
as
the
signature
poh
poh
no
nonsense
many
a
pretty
lass
has
thought
it
an
honor
to
be
kissed
by
turpin
eleanor
recoiled
with
deepest
disgust
as
she
saw
the
highwayman
thrust
aside
the
useless
opposition
of
the
priest
and
approach
her
he
had
removed
his
mask
his
face
flushed
with
insolent
triumph
was
turned
towards
her
despite
the
loathing
which
curdled
the
blood
within
her
veins
she
could
not
avert
her
eyes
he
drew
near
her
she
uttered
a
shrill
scream
at
that
moment
a
powerful
grasp
was
laid
upon
shoulder
he
turned
and
beheld
luke
save
me
save
me
cried
eleanor
addressing
the
new
comer
damnation
said
the
highwayman
what
has
brought
here
one
would
think
you
were
turned
assistant
to
all
distressed
damsels
quit
your
hold
or
by
the
god
above
us
you
will
repent
it
fool
exclaimed
luke
talk
thus
to
one
who
heeds
you
and
as
he
spoke
he
hurled
turpin
backwards
with
so
much
force
that
staggering
a
few
yards
the
highwayman
fell
to
the
ground
the
priest
stood
like
one
stunned
with
surprise
at
luke
sudden
appearance
and
subsequent
daring
action
luke
meanwhile
approached
eleanor
he
gazed
upon
her
with
curiosity
mixed
with
admiration
for
his
heart
told
him
she
was
very
fair
a
deathlike
paleness
had
spread
over
her
cheeks
yet
still
despite
the
want
of
color
she
looked
exquisitely
beautiful
and
her
large
blue
eyes
eloquently
thanked
her
deliverer
for
her
rescue
the
words
she
wanted
were
supplied
by
mowbray
who
thanked
him
in
appropriate
terms
when
they
were
interrupted
by
turpin
who
had
by
this
time
picked
himself
up
and
was
drawing
near
them
his
countenance
wore
a
fierce
expression
i
tell
you
what
said
he
luke
bradley
or
luke
rookwood
or
whatever
else
you
may
call
yourself
you
have
taken
a
damned
unfair
advantage
of
me
in
this
matter
and
deserve
nothing
better
at
my
hands
than
that
i
should
call
you
to
instant
account
for
it
and
curse
me
if
i
too
luke
bradley
interrupted
mowbray
are
you
that
individual
i
have
been
so
called
madam
replied
luke
father
ambrose
is
this
the
person
of
whom
you
spoke
eagerly
asked
the
lady
so
i
conclude
returned
the
priest
evasively
did
he
not
call
you
luke
rookwood
eagerly
demanded
eleanor
is
that
also
your
name
rookwood
is
my
name
fair
cousin
replied
luke
if
i
may
venture
to
call
you
so
and
ranulph
rookwood
is
my
brother
i
never
heard
he
had
a
brother
rejoined
eleanor
with
some
agitation
how
can
that
be
i
am
his
brother
nevertheless
replied
luke
moodily
his
elder
brother
eleanor
turned
to
her
mother
and
the
priest
with
a
look
of
imploring
anguish
she
saw
a
confirmation
of
the
truth
of
this
statement
in
their
glances
no
contradiction
was
offered
by
either
to
his
statement
both
indeed
appeared
in
some
mysterious
manner
prepared
for
it
this
then
was
the
dreaded
secret
this
was
the
cause
of
her
brother
sudden
departure
the
truth
flashed
with
lightning
swiftness
across
her
brain
chagrined
and
mortified
luke
remarked
that
glance
of
inquiry
his
pride
was
hurt
at
the
preference
thus
naturally
shown
towards
his
brother
he
had
been
struck
deeply
struck
with
her
beauty
he
acknowledged
the
truth
of
peter
words
eleanor
loveliness
was
without
parallel
he
had
seen
naught
so
fair
and
the
instant
he
beheld
her
he
felt
that
for
alone
could
he
cancel
his
vows
to
sybil
the
spirit
of
rivalry
and
jealousy
was
instantly
aroused
by
eleanor
exclamations
his
elder
brother
echoed
eleanor
dwelling
upon
his
words
and
addressing
luke
then
you
must
be
but
no
you
are
not
you
can
not
be
it
is
ranulph
title
it
is
not
yours
you
are
not
i
am
sir
luke
rookwood
replied
luke
proudly
ere
the
words
were
uttered
eleanor
had
fainted
assistance
is
at
hand
madam
if
you
will
accept
it
and
follow
me
said
luke
raising
the
insensible
girl
in
his
arms
and
bearing
her
down
the
hill
towards
the
encampment
whither
he
was
followed
by
mowbray
and
the
priest
between
whom
during
the
hurried
dialogue
we
have
detailed
very
significant
glances
had
been
exchanged
turpin
who
as
it
may
be
supposed
had
not
been
an
incurious
observer
of
the
scene
passing
burst
into
his
usual
loud
laugh
on
seeing
luke
bear
away
his
lovely
burden
cousin
ha
ha
said
he
so
the
wench
is
his
cousin
damme
i
half
suspect
he
has
fallen
in
love
with
his
cousin
and
if
so
miss
sybil
or
i
mistaken
will
look
as
yellow
as
a
guinea
if
that
little
spanish
devil
gets
it
into
her
pretty
jealous
pate
that
he
is
about
to
bring
home
a
new
mistress
we
shall
have
a
in
the
twinkling
of
a
however
i
sha
lose
sight
of
sir
luke
until
i
have
settled
my
accounts
with
him
hark
ye
boy
continued
he
addressing
the
postilion
remain
where
you
are
you
wo
be
wanted
yet
awhile
i
imagine
there
a
guinea
for
you
to
drink
dick
health
upon
which
he
mounted
his
mare
and
walked
her
easily
down
the
hill
and
so
that
be
dick
turpin
folks
talk
so
much
about
soliloquized
the
lad
looking
curiously
after
him
well
he
as
a
chap
as
need
be
blow
my
boots
if
he
ai
and
if
i
had
a
notion

were
he
i
have
pulled
up
at
first
call
without
more
ado
nothing
like
experience
i
shall
know
better
another
time
added
he
pocketing
the
douceur
rushing
swiftly
down
the
hill
luke
tarried
at
the
river
brink
to
sprinkle
some
of
the
cool
element
upon
the
pale
brow
of
eleanor
as
he
held
her
in
his
arms
thoughts
which
he
fain
would
have
stifled
in
their
birth
took
possession
of
his
heart
would
she
were
mine
murmured
he
yet
no
the
wish
is
unworthy
but
that
wish
returned
unbidden
eleanor
opened
her
eyes
she
was
still
too
weak
to
walk
without
support
and
luke
raising
her
once
more
in
his
arms
and
motioning
mowbray
to
follow
crossed
the
brook
by
means
of
and
conducted
his
charge
along
a
bypath
towards
the
priory
so
as
to
avoid
meeting
with
the
crew
assembled
upon
the
green
they
had
gained
one
of
the
roofless
halls
when
he
encountered
balthazar
astonished
at
the
sight
of
the
party
the
patrico
was
about
to
address
the
priest
as
an
acquaintance
when
his
more
orthodox
brother
raised
his
finger
to
his
lips
in
token
of
caution
the
action
passed
unobserved
hie
thee
to
sybil
said
luke
to
the
patrico
bid
her
haste
hither
say
that
this
maiden
that
miss
mowbray
is
here
and
requires
her
aid
fly
i
will
bear
her
to
the
refectory
as
balthazar
passed
the
priest
he
pointed
with
a
significant
glance
towards
a
chasm
in
the
wall
which
seemed
to
be
an
opening
to
some
subterraneous
chamber
the
father
again
made
a
gesture
of
silence
and
balthazar
hastened
upon
his
mission
luke
led
them
to
the
refectory
he
brought
a
chair
for
support
but
so
far
from
reviving
after
such
attention
as
could
be
afforded
her
she
appeared
to
become
weaker
he
was
about
to
issue
forth
in
search
of
sybil
when
to
his
surprise
he
found
the
door
fastened
you
can
not
pass
this
way
said
a
voice
which
luke
instantly
recognized
as
that
of
the
knight
of
malta
not
pass
echoed
luke
what
does
this
mean
our
orders
are
from

queen
returned
the
knight
at
this
instant
the
low
tone
of
a
muffled
bell
was
heard
ha
exclaimed
luke
some
danger
is
at
hand
his
heart
smote
him
as
he
thought
of
sybil
and
he
looked
anxiously
towards
eleanor
balthazar
rushed
into
the
room
where
is
sybil
cried
luke

patrico

barbara
lovel
as
she
suddenly
appeared
in
the
doorway
you
stir
not
excepting
at
my
pleasure
where
is
the
maiden
continued
she
looking
around
with
a
grim
smile
of
satisfaction
at
the
consternation
produced
by
her
appearance
ha
i
see
she
faints
here
is
a
cordial
that

rookwood
i
congratulate

upon
your
accession
of
dignity
turning
to
the
priest
who
was
evidently
overwhelmed
with
confusion
she
exclaimed

met

this
at
rookwood

barbara

it
is
long
since
my
poor
dwelling
has
been
so
highly
honored
but
i
must
not
delay
the
remedy

her
drink
of
this
said
she
handing
a
phial
to
mowbray
it
will
instantly
restore
her
it
is
poison
cried
luke
she
shall
not
drink
it
poison
reiterated
barbara
behold
and
she
drank
of
the
liquid
i
would
not
poison
your
bride
added
she
turning
to
luke
my
bride
echoed
luke
ay
your
bride
repeated
barbara
luke
recoiled
in
amazement
mowbray
almost
felt
inclined
to
believe
she
was
a
dreamer
so
visionary
did
the
whole
scene
appear
a
dense
crowd
of
witnesses
stood
at
the
entrance
foremost
amongst
them
was
the
sexton
suddenly
a
shriek
was
heard
and
the
crowd
opening
to
allow
her
passage
sybil
rushed
forward
well
go
thy
ways
old
nick
machiavel
there
will
never
be
the
peer
of
thee
for
wholesome
policy
and
good
counsel
thou
pains
to
chalk
men
out
the
dark
paths
and
hidden
plots
of
murther
and
deceit
and
no
man
has
the
grace
to
follow
thee
the
age
is
unthankful
thy
principles
are
quite
forsaken
and
worn
out
of
memory
shakerley
marmion
sybil
sudden
entrance
filled
the
group
that
surrounded
miss
mowbray
with
new
dismay
but
she
saw
them
not
her
soul
seemed
riveted
by
eleanor
towards
whom
she
rushed
and
while
her
eye
wandered
over
her
beauty
she
raised
the
braided
hair
from
her
brow
revealing
the
clear
polished
forehead
wonder
awe
devotion
pity
usurped
the
place
of
hatred
the
fierce
expression
that
had
lit
up
her
dark
orbs
was
succeeded
by
tender
commiseration
she
looked
an
imploring
appeal
at
barbara
ay
ay
returned
the
old
gipsy
extending
at
the
same
time
the
phial
i
understand
here
is
that
will
bring
the
blood
once
more
into
her
pallid
cheeks
and
kindle
the
fire
within
her
eyes
give
her
of
this
the
effect
of
the
potion
was
almost
instantaneous
amply
attesting
barbara
skill
in
its
concoction
stifled
respiration
first
proclaimed
eleanor
recovery
she
opened
her
large
and
languid
eyes
her
bosom
heaved
almost
to
bursting
her
pulses
throbbed
quickly
and
feverishly
and
as
the
stimulant
operated
the
wild
lustre
of
excitement
blazed
in
her
eyes
sybil
took
her
hand
to
chafe
it
the
eyes
of
the
two
maidens
met
they
gazed
upon
each
other
steadfastly
and
in
silence
eleanor
knew
not
whom
she
regarded
but
she
could
not
mistake
that
look
of
sympathy
she
could
not
mistake
the
tremulous
pressure
of
her
hand
she
felt
the
silent
trickling
tears
she
returned
the
sympathizing
glance
and
gazed
with
equal
wonder
upon
the
ministering
fairy
for
such
she
almost
seemed
that
knelt
before
her
as
her
looks
wandered
from
the
kindly
glance
of
sybil
to
the
withered
and
inauspicious
aspect
of
the
gipsy
queen
and
shifted
thence
to
the
dusky
figures
of
her
attendants
filled
with
renewed
apprehension
she
exclaimed
who
are
these
and
where
am
i
you
are
in
safety
replied
luke
this
is
the
ruined
priory
of
francis
and
those
strange
personages
are
a
horde
of
gipsies
you
need
fear
no
injury
from
them
my
deliverer
murmured
eleanor
when
all
at
once
the
recollection
that
he
had
avowed
himself
a
rookwood
and
the
elder
brother
of
ranulph
flashed
across
her
memory
gipsies
did
you
not
say
these
people
were
gipsies
your
own
attire
is
the
same
as
theirs
you
are
not
can
not
be
the
brother
of
ranulph
i
do
not
boast
the
same
mother
returned
luke
proudly
but
my
father
was
sir
piers
rookwood
and
i
am
his
elder
born
he
turned
away
dark
thoughts
swept
across
his
brain
maddened
by
the
beauty
of
eleanor
stung
by
her
slights
and
insensible
to
the
silent
agony
of
sybil
who
sought
in
vain
to
catch
his
eye
he
thought
of
nothing
but
of
revenge
and
the
accomplishment
of
his
purposes
all
within
was
a
wild
and
fearful
turmoil
his
better
principles
were
stifled
by
the
promptings
of
evil
methinks
cried
he
half
aloud
if
the
tempter
were
near
to
offer
the
maiden
to
me
even
at
the
peril
of
my
soul
welfare
i
could
not
resist
it
the
tempter
at
hand
he
is
seldom
absent
on
occasions
like
the
present
the
sexton
stood
beside
his
grandson
luke
started
he
eyed
peter
from
head
to
foot
almost
expecting
to
find
the
cloven
foot
supposed
to
be
proper
to
the
fiend
peter
grinned
in
ghastly
derision
soh
you
would
summon
hell
to
your
aid
and
lo
the
devil
is
at
your
elbow
well
she
is
yours
make
good
your
words
cried
luke
impatiently
softly
softly
returned
peter
moderate
yourself
and
your
wishes
shall
be
accomplished
your
own
desires
chime
with
those
of
others
nay
with
those
of
barbara
would
wed
you
to
miss
mowbray
you
stare
but
it
is
so
this
is
a
cover
for
some
deeper
plot
no
matter
it
shall
go
hard
despite
her
cunning
if
i
foil
her
not
at
her
own
weapons
there
is
more
mischief
in
that
old
woman
brain
than
was
ever
hatched
within
the
crocodile
egg
yet
she
shall
find
her
match
do
not
thwart
her
leave
all
to
me
she
is
about
it
now
added
he
noticing
barbara
and
mowbray
in
conference
together
be
patient
i
will
watch
her
and
he
quitted
his
grandson
for
the
purpose
of
scanning
more
closely
the
manœuvres
of
the
old
gipsy
barbara
meanwhile
had
not
remained
inactive
you
need
fear
no
relapse
in
your
daughter
i
will
answer
for
that
said
the
old
gipsy
to
mowbray
sybil
will
tend
her
quit
not
the
maiden
side
continued
she
addressing
her
grandchild
adding
in
a
whisper
be
cautious
alarm
her
not
mine
eye
will
be
upon
you
drop
not
a
word
so
saying
she
shuffled
to
a
little
distance
with
mowbray
keeping
sybil
in
view
and
watching
every
motion
as
the
panther
watches
the
gambols
of
a
fawn
know
you
who
speaks
to
you
said
the
old
crone
in
the
peculiar
low
and
confidential
tone
assumed
by
her
tribe
to
strangers
have
you
forgotten
the
name
of
barbara
lovel
i
have
no
distinct
remembrance
of
it
returned
mowbray
think
again
said
barbara
and
though
years
are
flown
you
may
perchance
recall
the
black
gipsy
woman
who
when
you
were
surrounded
with
gay
gallants
with
dancing
plumes
perused
your
palm
and
whispered
in
your
ear
the
favored
suitor
name
bide
with
me
a
moment
madam
said
barbara
seeing
that
mowbray
shrank
from
the
recollection
thus
conjured
up
i
am
old
very
old
i
have
survived
the
shows
of
flattery
and
being
vested
with
a
power
over
my
people
am
apt
perchance
to
take
too
much
upon
myself
with
others
the
old
gipsy
paused
here
and
then
assuming
a
more
familiar
tone
exclaimed
the
estates
of
rookwood
are
ample
woman
what
mean
you
they
should
have
been
yours
lady
and
would
have
been
but
for
that
marriage
you
would
have
beseemed
them
bravely
sir
reginald
was
wilful
and
erased
the
daughter
name
to
substitute
that
of
his
son
pity
it
is
that
so
fair
a
creature
as
miss
mowbray
should
lack
the
dower
her
beauty
and
her
birth
entitle
her
to
expect
pity
that
ranulph
rookwood
should
lose
his
title
at
the
moment
when
he
deemed
it
was
dropping
into
his
possession
pity
that
those
broad
lands
should
pass
away
from
you
and
your
children
as
they
will
do
if
ranulph
and
eleanor
are
united
they
never
shall
be
united
replied
mowbray
hastily
indeed
to
wed
your
child
to
beggary
said
barbara
mowbray
sighed
deeply
there
is
a
way
continued
the
old
crone
in
a
deep
whisper
by
which
the
estates
might
still
be
hers
and
yours
indeed
said
mowbray
eagerly
sir
piers
rookwood
had
two
sons
ha
the
elder
is
here
luke
sir
luke
he
brought
us
hither
he
loves
your
daughter
i
saw
his
gaze
of
passion
just
now
i
am
old
now
but
i
have
some
skill
in
lovers
glances
why
not
wed
her
to
him
i
read
hands
read
hearts
you
know
they
were
born
for
each
other
now
madam
do
you
understand
me
but
returned
mowbray
with
hesitation
though
i
might
wish
for
though
i
might
sanction
this
eleanor
is
betrothed
to
ranulph
she
loves
him
think
not
of
if
are
satisfied
she
can
not
judge
so
well
for
herself
as
you
can
for
her
she
is
a
child
and
knows
not
what
she
loves
her
affection
will
soon
be
luke
he
is
a
noble
youth
the
image
of
his
grandfather
your
father
sir
reginald
and
if
your
daughter
be
betrothed
to
any
one
was
to
the
heir
of
rookwood
that
was
an
essential
part
of
the
contract
why
should
the
marriage
not
take
place
at
once
and
here
here
how
were
that
possible
you
are
within
sacred
walls
i
will
take
you
where
an
altar
stands
there
is
no
lack
of
holy
priest
to
join
their
hands
together
your
companion
father
ambrose
as
you
call
him
will
do
the
office
fittingly
he
has
essayed
his
clerkly
skill
already
on
others
of
your
house
to
what
do
you
allude
mysterious
woman
asked
mowbray
with
anxiety
to
sir
piers
and
susan
bradley
returned
barbara
that
priest
united
them
indeed
he
never
told
me
this
he
dared
not
do
so
he
had
an
oath
which
bound
him
to
concealment
the
time
is
coming
when
greater
mysteries
will
be
revealed
is
strange
i
should
not
have
heard
of
this
before
said
mowbray
musingly
and
yet
i
might
have
guessed
as
much
from
his
obscure
hints
respecting
ranulph
i
see
it
all
now
i
see
the
gulf
into
which
i
might
have
been
plunged
but
i
am
warned
in
time
father
ambrose
continued
she
to
the
priest
who
was
pacing
the
chamber
at
some
little
distance
from
them
is
it
true
that
my
brother
was
wedded
by
you
to
susan
bradley
ere
the
priest
could
reply
the
sexton
presented
himself
ha
the
very
father
of
the
girl
said
mowbray
whom
i
met
within
our
family
vault
and
who
was
so
strangely
moved
when
i
spoke
to
him
of
alan
rookwood
is
he
here
likewise
alan
rookwood
echoed
barbara
upon
whom
a
light
seemed
suddenly
to
break
ha
what
said
he
of
him
raven
interposed
peter
fiercely
be
content
with
what
thou
knowest
of
the
living
and
trouble
not
the
repose
of
the
dead
let
them
rest
in
their
infamy
the
dead
echoed
barbara
with
a
chuckling
laugh
ha
ha
he
is
dead
then
and
what
became
of
his
fair
wife
his
brother
minion
was
a
foul
deed
i
grant
and
yet
there
was
expiation
blood
flowed
blood
silence
thou
night
hag
thundered
peter
or
i
will
have
thee
burned
at
the
stake
for
the
sorcery
thou
practisest
beware
added
he
in
a
deep
tone
i
am
thy
friend
barbara
withered
countenance
exhibited
for
an
instant
the
deepest
indignation
at
the
sexton
threat
the
malediction
trembled
on
her
tongue
she
raised
her
staff
to
smite
him
but
she
checked
the
action
in
the
same
tone
and
with
a
sharp
suspicious
look
she
replied
my
sayest
thou
see
that
it
prove
so
or
beware
of
and
with
a
malignant
scowl
the
gipsy
queen
slowly
shuffled
towards
her
satellites
who
were
stationed
at
the
door
no
marriage
i
esteem
it
where
the
friends
force
love
upon
their
children
where
the
virgin
is
not
so
truly
given
as
betrayed
i
would
not
have
betrothed
people
for
i
can
by
no
means
call
them
lovers
make
their
rites
no
wedlock
but
a
sacrifice
of
love
and
eleanor
mowbray
had
witnessed
her
mother
withdrawal
from
her
side
with
much
uneasiness
and
was
with
difficulty
prevented
by
sybil
from
breaking
upon
her
conference
with
the
gipsy
queen
barbara
dark
eye
was
fixed
upon
them
during
the
whole
of
the
interview
and
communicated
an
indefinite
sense
of
dread
to
eleanor
who
who
is
that
old
woman
asked
eleanor
under
her
breath
never
even
in
my
wildest
dreams
have
i
seen
aught
so
terrible
why
does
she
look
so
at
us
she
terrifies
me
and
yet
she
can
not
mean
me
ill
or
my
mother
we
have
never
injured
her
alas
sighed
sybil
you
sigh
exclaimed
eleanor
in
alarm
is
there
any
real
danger
then
help
us
to
avoid
it
quick
warn
my
mother
she
seems
agitated
oh
let
me
go
to
her
hush
whispered
sybil
maintaining
an
unmoved
demeanor
under
the
gaze
of
barbara
stir
not
as
you
value
your
life
you
know
not
where
you
are
or
what
may
befall
you
your
safety
depends
upon
your
composure
your
life
is
not
in
danger
but
what
is
dearer
than
life
your
love
is
threatened
with
a
fatal
blow
there
is
a
dark
design
to
wed
you
to
another
heavens
ejaculated
eleanor
and
to
whom
to
sir
luke
rookwood
i
would
die
sooner
marry
they
shall
kill
me
ere
they
force
me
to
it
could
you
not
love
him
love
him
i
have
only
seen
him
within
this
hour
i
knew
not
of
his
existence
he
rescued
me
from
peril
i
would
thank
him
i
would
love
him
if
i
could
for
ranulph
sake
and
yet
for
ranulph
sake
i
hate
him
speak
not
of
him
thus
to
me
said
sybil
angrily
if
love
him
not
love
him
oh
forgive
me
lady
pardon
my
impatience
my
heart
is
breaking
yet
it
has
not
ceased
to
beat
for
him
you
say
you
will
die
sooner
than
consent
to
this
forced
union
your
faith
shall
not
be
so
cruelly
attested
if
there
must
be
a
victim
i
will
be
the
sacrifice
god
grant
i
may
be
the
only
one
be
happy
as
happy
as
i
am
wretched
you
shall
see
what
the
love
of
a
gipsy
can
do
as
she
spoke
sybil
burst
into
a
flood
of
passionate
tears
eleanor
regarded
her
with
the
deepest
commiseration
but
the
feeling
was
transient
for
barbara
now
advancing
exclaimed
hence
to
your
mother
the
bridegroom
is
waiting
to
your
mother
girl
and
she
motioned
eleanor
fiercely
away
what
means
this
continued
the
old
gipsy
what
have
you
said
to
that
girl
did
i
not
caution
you
against
speech
with
her
and
you
have
dared
to
disobey
me
you
my
grandchild
the
daughter
of
my
agatha
with
whom
my
slightest
wish
was
law
i
abandon
you
i
curse
you
oh
curse
me
not
cried
sybil
add
not
to
my
despair
then
follow
my
advice
implicitly
cast
off
this
weakness
all
is
in
readiness
luke
shall
descend
into
the
vaulted
chapel
the
ceremony
shall
there
take
place
there
also
shall
eleanor
and
there
again
shall
you
be
wedded
take
this
phial
place
it
within
the
folds
of
your
girdle
when
all
is
over
i
will
tell
you
how
to

replied
sybil
as
she
departed
in
the
direction
of
luke
barbara
watched
her
join
him
and
then
turned
shortly
towards
mowbray
and
her
daughter

said
sybil

faithless
lover

laughter

by

dreadful

subject
to
the
power
of

wild
laughter

the
guilt
of

death

to

from
that
remorse
that

die
sybil
you
have
said
rightly
i
am
not
myself
i
know
not
what
demons
have
possession
of
my
soul
that
i
can
behold
your
agonies
without
remorse
that
your
matchless
affection
should
awaken
no
return
yet
so
it
is
since
the
fatal
moment
when
i
beheld
yon
maid
i
have
loved
her
no
more

can
part
with
you

wretch
that

receive
your
pardon

let
me
clasp
you
once
more
within
my
arms
may

live
to
happier
days
may
you
oh
to
die
thus
sobbed
sybil
disengaging
herself
from
his
embrace
live
to
happier
days
said
you
when
have
given
you
reason
to
doubt
for
an
instant
the
sincerity
of
love
that
you
should
insult
me
thus
then
live
with
me
live
for
me
if
you
can
love
me
still
i
will
live
as
your
slave
your
minion
your
wife
aught
you
will
have
me
be
you
have
raised
me
from
wretchedness
oh
continued
she
in
an
altered
tone
have
i
mistaken
your
meaning
did
you
utter
those
words
in
false
compassion
for
my
sufferings
speak
it
is
not
yet
too
late
all
may
be
well
my
fate
my
life
is
in
your
hands
if
you
love
me
yet
if
you
can
forsake
eleanor
speak
if
not
be
silent
luke
averted
his
head
enough
continued
sybil
in
a
voice
of
agony
i
understand
may
god
forgive
you
fare
you
well
we
shall
meet
no
more
do
we
part
for
ever
asked
luke
without
daring
to
regard
her
for
ever
answered
sybil
before
her
lover
could
reply
she
shot
from
his
side
and
plunging
amidst
the
dark
and
dense
assemblage
near
the
door
disappeared
from
view
an
instant
after
she
emerged
into
the
open
air
she
stood
within
the
roofless
hall
it
was
filled
with
sunshine
with
the
fresh
breath
of
morn
the
ivied
ruins
the
grassy
floor
the
blue
vault
of
heaven
seemed
to
greet
her
with
a
benignant
smile
all
was
and
rejoicing
all
save
her
heart
amid
such
brightness
her
sorrow
seemed
harsh
and
unnatural
as
she
felt
the
glad
influence
of
day
she
was
scarcely
able
to
refrain
from
tears
it
was
terrible
to
leave
this
beautiful
world
that
blue
sky
that
sunshine
and
all
she
loved
so
young
so
soon
entering
a
low
arch
that
yawned
within
the
wall
she
vanished
like
a
ghost
at
the
approach
of
morn
thou
hast
practised
on
her
with
foul
charms
abused
her
delicate
youth
with
drugs
and
minerals
shakspeare
to
return
to
eleanor
mowbray
in
a
state
of
mind
bordering
upon
distraction
she
rushed
to
her
mother
and
flinging
her
arms
wildly
round
her
neck
besought
her
to
protect
her
mowbray
gazed
anxiously
upon
the
altered
countenance
of
her
daughter
but
a
few
moments
relieved
her
from
much
of
her
the
expression
of
pain
gradually
subsided
and
the
look
of
vacuity
was
succeeded
by
one
of
frenzied
excitement
a
film
had
for
an
instant
or
two
dimmed
her
eyes
they
now
gleamed
with
unnatural
lustre
she
smiled
the
smile
was
singular
it
was
not
the
playful
pleasurable
lighting
up
of
the
face
that
it
used
to
be
but
it
a
smile
and
the
mother
heart
was
satisfied
mowbray
knew
not
to
what
circumstance
she
could
attribute
this
wondrous
change
she
looked
at
the
priest
he
was
more
apt
in
divining
the
probable
cause
of
the
sudden
alteration
in
eleanor
manner
what
if
she
has
swallowed
a
said
he
approaching
mowbray
and
speaking
in
a
whisper
i
have
heard
of
such
abominable
mixtures
indeed
the
holy
jerome
himself
relates
an
instance
of
similar
sorcery
in
his
life
of
hilarius
and
these
people
are
said
to
compound
them
it
may
be
so
replied
mowbray
in
the
same
tone
i
think
that
the
peculiar
softness
in
the
eye
is
more
than
natural
i
will
at
least
hazard
an
experiment
to
attest
the
truth
or
fallacy
of
my
supposition
returned
the
father
do
you
see
your
destined
bridegroom
yonder
continued
he
addressing
eleanor
she
followed
with
her
eyes
in
the
direction
which
father
ambrose
pointed
she
beheld
luke
we
know
not
how
to
describe
the
sensations
which
now
possessed
her
she
thought
not
of
ranulph
or
if
she
did
it
was
with
vague
indifference
wrapped
in
a
kind
of
mental
trance
she
yielded
to
the
pleasurable
impulse
that
directed
her
unsettled
fancies
towards
luke
for
some
moments
she
did
not
take
her
eyes
from
him
the
priest
and
mowbray
watched
her
in
silence
nothing
passed
between
the
party
till
luke
joined
them
eleanor
continued
gazing
at
him
and
the
seeming
tenderness
of
her
glance
emboldened
luke
to
advance
towards
her
the
soft
fire
that
dwelt
in
those
orbs
was
however
cold
as
the
shining
wing
of
the
luciola
luke
approached
her
he
took
her
hand
she
withdrew
it
not
he
kissed
it
still
she
withdrew
it
not
but
gazed
at
him
with
eyes
my
daughter
is
yours
sir
luke
rookwood
exclaimed
mowbray
what
says
the
maid
herself
asked
luke
eleanor
answered
not
her
eyes
were
still
fixed
on
him
she
will
not
refuse
me
her
hand
said
luke
the
victim
resisted
not
to
the
subterranean
shrine
cried
barbara
and
she
gave
the
preconcerted
signal
to
the
band
the
signal
was
repeated
by
the
gipsy
crew
we
may
here
casually
note
that
the
crew
had
been
by
no
means
uninterested
or
silent
spectators
of
passing
events
but
had
on
the
contrary
indulged
themselves
in
a
variety
of
conjectures
as
to
their
probable
issue
several
bets
were
pending
as
to
whether
it
would
be
a
match
or
not
after
all
zoroaster
took
long
odds
that
the
match
was
off
offering
a
to
in
other
words
a
guinea
to
a
that
sybil
would
be
the
bride
his
offer
was
taken
at
once
by
jerry
juniper
and
backed
by
the
knight
of
malta
ha
there
the
signal
cried
the
knight
i
trouble
you
for
the

and
i
added
jerry

for
another

fairly
spliced

the

minutes

answered
the
crew
here
a
torch
for
the
altar
of
hymen
said
the
knight
flashing
his
torch
in
the
eyes
of
the
patrico
as
he
passed
him
for
the
halter
of
haman
you
might
say
returned
balthazar
sulkily
it
well
if
some
of
us
do
swing
for
it
you
do
say
rejoined
the
perplexed
magus
swing
egad
i
fear
a
ticklish
business
but
there
no
fighting
shy
i
fear
with
barbara
present
and
then
there
that
infernal
it
will
be
so
cursedly
regular
if
you

done

balty
it
would
not
have

farden
luckily
there
will
be
no
vitnesses
to
snitch
upon
us
there
will
be
no
one
in
the
vault
besides
ourselves
there
will
be
a
silent
and
a
solemn
witness
returned
balthazar
and
one
whom
you
expect
not
eh
vot
that
you
say
a
spy
but
the
patrico
was
gone
make
way
there
make
way
pals
for
the
bride
and
bridegroom
cried
the
knight
of
malta
drawing
excalibur
and
preparing
to
lead
the
way
to
the
vault
the
train
began
to
move
eleanor
leaned
upon
the
arm
of
her
mother
beside
them
stalked
barbara
with
an
aspect
of
triumph
luke
followed
with
the
priest
one
by
one
the
assemblage
quitted
the
apartment
the
sexton
alone
lingered
the
moment
is
at
hand
said
he
musingly
when
all
shall
be
consummated
a
few
steps
brought
him
into
the
court
the
crowd
was
there
still
a
brief
delay
had
taken
place
the
knight
of
malta
then
entered
the
mouth
of
the
vault
he
held
his
torch
so
as
to
reveal
a
broken
flight
of
steps
conducting
it
would
seem
to
regions
of
perpetual
night
so
thought
eleanor
as
she
shudderingly
gazed
into
the
abyss
she
hesitated
she
trembled
she
refused
but
her
mother
entreaties
and
barbara
threatening
looks
induced
in
the
end
reluctant
compliance
at
length
the
place
was
empty
peter
was
about
to
follow
when
the
sound
of
a
horse
hoofs
broke
upon
his
ear
he
tarried
for
an
instant
and
the
mounted
figure
of
the
highwayman
burst
within
the
limits
of
the
court
ha
ha
old
earthworm
cried
dick
my
nestor
of
the
churchyard
alone
where
the
devil
are
all
the
folks
gone
where
sir
luke
and
his
cousin
eh
peter
hastily
explained
a
wedding
under
ground

fun

all
probability

peter
but
i

to
anticipate
my
destiny

must
and
shall
that
peremptory
you
will
be
the
gainer
by
it
sir
luke
will
reward
you
nobly
i
will
answer
for
him
you
can
serve
him
most
effectually
ranulph
rookwood
and
major
mowbray
are
expected
here
the
devil
they
are
but
how
or
why
i
have
not
time
to
explain
in
case
of
a
surprise
discharge
a
pistol
they
must
not
enter
the
vault
have
you
a
whistle
for
you
must
play
a
double
part
and
we
may
need
your
assistance
below
sir
luke
may
command
me
here
a
pipe
as
shrill
as
the
devil
own
if
it
will
summon
you
to
our
assistance
below
is
all
i
need
may
we
rely
on
you
when
did
dick
turpin
desert
his
friends
anywhere
on
this
side
the
styx
the
sound
of
that
whistle
will
reach
me
i
ride
about
the
court
and
stand
sentry
enough
replied
the
sexton
as
he
dived
under
ground
take
care
of
your
shins
shouted
dick
that
a
cursed
ugly
turn
but
he
used
to
the
dark
a
surprise
eh
i
just
give
a
look
to
my
snappers
flints
all
safe
now
i
ready
for
them
come
when
they
like
and
having
made
the
circuit
of
the
place
he
halted
near
the
mouth
of
the
subterranean
chapel
to
be
within
hearing
of
peter
whistle
and
throwing
his
right
leg
lazily
over
his
saddle
proceeded
coolly
to
light
a
short
pipe
the
luxury
of
the
cigar
being
then
unknown
humming
the
while
snatches
of
a
ballad
the
theme
of
which
was
his
own
calling
the
scampsman
quis
verè
rex
seneca
there
is
not
a
king
should
you
search
the
world
round
so
blithe
as
the
king
of
the
road
to
be
found
his
pistol
his
sceptre
his
saddle
his
throne
whence
he
levies
supplies
or
enforces
a
loan
to
this
monarch
the
highway
presents
a
wide
field
where
each
passing
subject
a
tribute
must
yield
his
palace
the
tavern
receives
him
at
night
where
sweet
lips
and
sound
liquor
crown
all
with
delight
the
soldier
and
sailor
both
robbers
by
trade
full
soon
on
the
shelf
if
disabled
are
laid
the
one
gets
a
patch
and
the
other
a
peg
but
while
luck
lasts
the
highwayman
shakes
a
loose
leg
most
fowl
rise
at
dawn
but
the
owl
wakes
at
and
a
jollier
bird
can
there
nowhere
be
seen
like
the
owl
our
snug
scampsman
his
snooze
takes
by
day
and
when
night
draws
her
curtain
scuds
after
his
prey
as
the
highwayman
life
is
the
fullest
of
zest
so
the
highwayman
death
is
the
briefest
and
best
he
dies
not
as
other
men
die
by
but
at
once
without
wincing
and
quite
at
his
ease
and
thus
for
the
present
we
leave
him
o
rare
dick
turpin
cyprian
lasciate
ogni
speranza
voi
ch
entrate
dante
cyprian
de
mulverton
fifth
prior
of
the
monastery
of
saint
francis
a
prelate
of
singular
sanctity
being
afflicted
in
his
latter
days
with
a
despondency
so
deep
that
neither
penance
nor
fasting
could
remove
it
vowed
never
again
to
behold
with
earthly
eyes
the
blessed
light
of
heaven
nor
to
dwell
longer
with
his
fellowmen
but
relinquishing
his
spiritual
dignity
the
world
forgetting
by
the
world
forgot
to
immure
himself
while
living
within
the
tomb
he
kept
his
vow
out
of
the
living
rock
that
sustained
the
saintly
structure
beneath
the
chapel
of
the
monastery
was
another
chapel
wrought
and
thither
after
bidding
an
eternal
farewell
to
the
world
and
bestowing
his
benediction
upon
his
flock
whom
he
committed
to
the
care
of
his
successor
the
holy
man
retired
never
save
at
midnight
and
then
only
during
the
performance
of
masses
for
his
soul
repose
did
he
ascend
from
his
cell
and
as
the
sole
light
allowed
within
the
dismal
dungeon
of
his
choice
was
that
of
a
sepulchral
lamp
as
none
spoke
with
him
when
in
his
retreat
save
in
muttered
syllables
what
effect
must
the
lustre
emanating
from
a
thousand
tapers
the
warm
and
pungent
odors
of
the
shrine
contrasted
with
the
earthy
vapors
of
his
and
the
solemn
swell
of
the
sanctus
have
had
upon
his
excited
senses
surely
they
must
have
seemed
like
a
foretaste
of
the
heaven
he
sought
to
gain
ascetic
to
the
severest
point
to
which
nature
endurance
could
be
stretched
cyprian
even
denied
himself
repose
he
sought
not
sleep
and
knew
it
only
when
it
stole
on
him
unawares
his
couch
was
the
flinty
rock
and
long
afterwards
when
the
zealous
resorted
to
the
sainted
prior
cell
and
were
shown
those
sharp
and
jagged
stones
they
marvelled
how
one
like
unto
themselves
could
rest
or
even
recline
upon
their
points
without
anguish
until
it
was
explained
to
them
that
doubtless
he
who
tempereth
the
wind
to
the
shorn
lamb
had
made
that
flinty
couch
soft
to
the
holy
sufferer
as
a
bed
of
down
his
limbs
were
clothed
in
a
garb
of
horsehair
of
the
coarsest
fabric
his
drink
was
the
dank
drops
that
oozed
from
the
porous
walls
of
his
cell
and
his
sustenance
such
morsels
as
were
bestowed
upon
him
by
the
poor
the
only
strangers
permitted
to
approach
him
no
fire
was
suffered
where
perpetual
winter
reigned
none
were
admitted
to
his
nightly
vigils
none
witnessed
any
act
of
penance
nor
were
any
groans
heard
to
issue
from
that
dreary
cave
but
the
knotted
thong
discovered
near
his
couch
too
plainly
betrayed
in
what
manner
those
long
lone
nights
were
spent
thus
did
a
year
roll
on
traces
of
his
sufferings
were
visible
in
his
failing
strength
he
could
scarcely
crawl
but
he
meekly
declined
assistance
he
appeared
not
as
had
been
his
wont
at
the
midnight
mass
the
door
of
his
cell
was
thrown
open
at
that
hour
the
light
streamed
down
like
a
glory
upon
his
reverend
head
he
heard
the
distant
reverberations
of
the
deep
and
breathed
odors
as
if
wafted
from
paradise
one
morn
it
chanced
that
they
who
sought
his
cell
found
him
with
his
head
upon
his
bosom
kneeling
before
the
image
of
the
virgin
patroness
of
his
shrine
fearing
to
disturb
his
devotions
they
stood
reverently
looking
on
and
thus
silently
did
they
tarry
for
an
hour
but
as
in
that
space
he
had
shown
no
signs
of
motion
fearing
the
worst
they
ventured
to
approach
him
he
was
cold
as
the
marble
before
which
he
knelt
in
the
act
of
humblest
intercession
it
may
be
in
the
hope
of
grace
had
cyprian
spirit
fled
blessed
are
they
who
die
in
the
lord
exclaimed
his
brethren
regarding
his
remains
with
deepest
awe
on
being
touched
the
body
fell
to
the
ground
it
was
little
more
than
a
skeleton
under
the
cloisters
of
the
holy
pile
were
his
bones
interred
with
a
degree
of
pomp
and
ostentation
that
little
accorded
with
the
lowliness
and
of
this
man
of
many
sorrows
this
chapel
at
the
time
of
which
we
treat
was
pretty
much
in
the
same
condition
as
it
existed
in
the
days
of
its
holy
inmate
hewn
out
of
the
entrails
of
the
rock
the
roof
the
vaults
the
floor
were
of
solid
granite
three
huge
cylindrical
pillars
carved
out
of
the
native
rock
rough
as
the
stems
of
gnarled
lent
support
to
the
ceiling
support
however
was
unneeded
an
earthquake
would
scarce
have
shaken
down
those
solid
rafters
only
in
one
corner
where
the
water
welled
through
a
crevice
of
the
rock
in
drops
that
fell
like
tears
was
decay
manifest
here
the
stone
worn
by
the
constant
dripping
had
in
some
places
given
way
in
shape
the
vault
was
circular
the
integral
between
each
massive
pillar
formed
a
pointed
arch
again
from
each
pillar
sprang
other
arches
which
crossed
by
diagonal
ogive
branches
weaving
one
into
the
other
and
radiating
from
the
centre
formed
those
beautifully
intricate
combinations
upon
which
the
eye
of
the
architectural
enthusiast
loves
to
linger
within
the
ring
formed
by
these
triple
columns
in
which
again
the
pillars
had
their
own
web
of
arches
was
placed
an
altar
of
stone
and
beside
it
a
crucifix
of
the
same
rude
material
here
also
stood
the
sainted
image
of
her
who
had
filled
the
prior
with
holy
aspirations
now
a
shapeless
stone
the
dim
lamp
that
like
a
star
struggling
with
the
thick
gloom
of
a
wintry
cell
had
shed
its
slender
radiance
over
the
brow
of
the
virgin
thecla
was
gone
but
around
the
keystone
of
the
central
arches
whence
a
chain
had
once
depended
might
be
traced
in
ancient
characters
half
effaced
by
time
the
inscription
sta
thecla
ora
pro
nobis
one
outlet
only
was
there
from
the
chapel
that
which
led
by
winding
steps
to
the
monastery
one
only
recess
the
prior
cell
the
former
faced
the
altar
the
latter
yawned
like
the
mouth
of
a
tomb
at
its
back
altogether
it
was
a
dreary
place
dumb
were
its
walls
as
when
they
refused
to
return
the
murmured
orisons
of
the
anchorite
one
uniform
sad
coloring
prevailed
throughout
the
gray
granite
was
grown
hoar
with
age
and
had
a
ghostly
look
the
columns
were
ponderous
and
projected
heavy
shadows
sorrow
and
superstition
had
their
tale
and
a
moral
gloom
deepened
the
darkness
of
the
spot
despair
which
had
inspired
its
construction
seemed
to
brood
therein
hope
shunned
its
inexorable
recesses
alone
within
this
dismal
sanctuary
with
hands
outstretched
towards
the
desecrated
image
of
its
tutelar
saint
knelt
sybil
all
was
darkness
neither
the
heavy
vapors
that
surrounded
her
nor
the
shrine
before
which
she
bent
were
visible
but
familiar
with
the
dreary
spot
she
knew
that
she
had
placed
herself
aright
her
touch
had
satisfied
her
that
she
bowed
before
the
altar
of
stone
that
her
benighted
vision
was
turned
towards
the
broken
image
of
the
saint
though
now
involved
in
gloom
the
most
profound
and
with
clasped
hands
and
streaming
eyes
in
low
and
mournful
tones
she
addressed
herself
in
the
following
hymn
to
the
tutelar
saint
of
the
spot
hymn
to
saint
thecla
in
my
trouble
in
my
anguish
in
the
depths
of
my
despair
as
in
grief
and
pain
i
languish
unto
thee
i
raise
my
prayer
sainted
virgin
martyr
maiden
let
thy
countenance
incline
upon
one
with
woes
kneeling
lowly
at
thy
shrine
that
in
agony
in
terror
in
her
blind
perplexity
wandering
weak
in
doubt
and
error
calleth
feebly
upon
thee
sinful
thoughts
sweet
saint
oppress
me
thoughts
that
will
not
be
dismissed
temptations
dark
possess
me
which
my
strength
may
not
resist
i
am
full
of
pain
and
weary
of
my
life
i
fain
would
die
unto
me
the
world
is
dreary
to
the
grave
for
rest
i
fly
for
rest
oh
could
i
borrow
thy
bright
wings
celestial
dove
they
should
waft
me
from
my
sorrow
where
peace
dwells
in
bowers
above
upon
one
with
woes
kneeling
lowly
at
thy
shrine
sainted
virgin
martyr
maiden
let
thy
countenance
incline
miserere

by
thy
loveliness
thy
purity
unpolluted
undefiled
that
in
serene
security
upon
earth
temptations
smiled
by
the
fetters
that
constrain
thee
by
thy
faith
by
the
fervor
that
sustain
thee
by
thine
death
by
thy
soul
divine
elation
thine
agonies
assuring
of
thy
sanctified
translation
to
beatitude
enduring
by
the
mystic
interfusion
of
thy
spirit
with
the
rays
that
in
ever
bright
profusion
round
the
throne
eternal
blaze
by
thy
portion
now
partaken
with
the
just
look
on
one
of
hope
forsaken
from
the
gates
of
mercy
thrust
upon
one
with
woes
kneeling
lowly
at

shrine
sainted
virgin

maiden
let
thy
countenance
incline
pro
me
mortis
horâ
sancta
virgo

kyrie
eleison
the
sweet
sad
voice
of
the
singer
died
faintly
away
the
sharpness
of
her
sorrow
was
assuaged
seldom
indeed
is
it
that
fervent
supplication
fails
to
call
down
solace
to
the
afflicted
sybil
became
more
composed
she
still
however
trembled
at
the
thoughts
of
what
remained
to
be
done
they
will
be
here
ere
my
prayer
is
finished
murmured
she
ere
the
end
is
accomplished
for
which
i
came
hither
alone
let
me
oh
let
me
make
my
peace
with
my
creator
ere
i
surrender
my
being
to
his
hands
and
then
let
them
deal
with
me
as
they
will
and
she
bowed
her
head
in
lowly
prayer
again
raising
her
hands
and
casting
her
eyes
towards
the
black
ceiling
she
implored
in
song
the
intercession
of
the
saintly
man
who
had
bequeathed
his
name
to
the
cell
hymn
to
saint
cyprian
hear
oh
hear
me
sufferer
holy
who
didst
make
thine
habitation
these
rocks
devoting
wholly
life
to
one
long
expiation
of
thy
guiltiness
and
solely
by
severe
mortification
didst
deliver
thee
oh
hear
me
in
my
dying
moments
cheer
me
by
thy
penance
aid
me
in
the
hour
of
trial
may
through
thee
my
prayers
prevailing
on
the
majesty
of
heaven
the
hosts
of
hell
assailing
my
soul
in
this
dark
hour
be
driven
so
my
spirit
when
exhaling
may
of
sinfulness
be
shriven
and
his
gift
unto
the
giver
may
be
rendered
pure
as
ever
by
thy
own
dark
dread
possession
aid
me
with
thine
intercession
scarcely
had
she
concluded
this
hymn
when
the
torch
of
the
knight
of
malta
in
part
dissipated
the
gloom
that
hung
around
the
chapel
i
will
not
die
i
must
not
i
am
contracted
to
a
young
gentleman
here
your
of
slowly
did
the
train
descend
solemnly
and
in
silence
as
if
the
rites
at
which
they
were
about
to
assist
had
been
those
of
funereal
and
not
of
nuptial
solemnization
indeed
to
look
upon
those
wild
and
fierce
faces
by
the
torchlight
which
lent
to
each
a
stern
and
savage
expression
to
see
those
scowling
visages
surrounding
a
bride
from
whose
pallid
cheeks
every
vestige
of
color
and
almost
of
animation
had
fled
and
a
bridegroom
with
a
countenance
yet
more
haggard
and
demeanor
yet
more
distracted
the
beholder
must
have
imagined
that
the
spectacle
was
some
horrible
ceremonial
practised
by
demons
rather
than
human
beings
the
arched
vault
the
pillars
the
torchlight
the
deep
shadows
and
the
wild
figures
formed
a
picture
worthy
of
rembrandt
or
salvator
is
sybil
within
the
chapel
asked
barbara
i
am
here
returned
a
voice
from
the
altar
why
do
we
tarry
said
the
gipsy
queen
we
are
all
assembled
to
the
altar
to
the
altar
shrieked
eleanor
oh
no
no
remember
my
threat
and
obey
muttered
barbara
you
are
in
my
power
now
a
convulsive
sob
was
all
the
answer
eleanor
could
make
our
number
is
not
complete
said
the
priest
who
had
looked
in
vain
for
the
sexton
peter
bradley
is
not
with
us
ha
exclaimed
barbara
let
him
be
sought
for
instantly
their
search
need
not
extend
beyond
this
spot
said
peter
stepping
forward
the
knight
of
malta
advanced
towards
the
altar
the
torchlight
reddened
upon
the
huge
stone
pillars
it
fell
upon
the
shrine
and
upon
the
ghastly
countenance
of
sybil
who
stood
beside
it
suddenly
as
the
light
approached
her
an
object
hitherto
hidden
from
view
was
revealed
sybil
uttered
a
prolonged
and
fearful
shriek
the
knight
recoiled
likewise
in
horror
and
a
simultaneous
cry
of
astonishment
burst
from
the
lips
of
the
foremost
of
the
group
all
crowded
forwards
and
universal
consternation
prevailed
amongst
the
assemblage
each
one
gazed
at
his
neighbor
anxious
to
learn
the
occasion
of
this
tumult
and
vague
fears
were
communicated
to
those
behind
from
the
terrified
glances
which
were
the
only
answers
returned
by
their
comrades
in
front
who
has
dared
to
bring
that
body
here
demanded
barbara
in
a
tone
in
which
anger
struggled
with
apprehension
pointing
at
the
same
time
to
the
ghastly
corpse
of
a
female
with
streaming
hair
at
the
feet
who
has
dared
to
do
this
i
say
quick
remove
it
what
do
you
stare
at
cravens
is
this
the
first
time
you
have
looked
upon
a
corpse
that
you
should
shrink
aghast
that
you
tremble
before
it
it
is
a
clod
ay
less
than
a
clod
away
with
it

say

cried
luke
lifting
a
cloud
of
black
hair
from
off
the
features
it
is
my
mother

daughter
exclaimed
the
sexton
what
vociferated
barbara
is

dead

to
do
honor
to
these
nuptials

peter
glancing
fiercely
at
barbara
i
may
anon
demand
that
question
of
you
how
came
this
body
here

of
richard
checkley
said
barbara
turning
to
the
priest

she
in
a
low
voice
this
is
your
handiwork
checkley
screamed
peter
is
that
richard
checkley

that
peace
thundered
barbara
will
none
remove
the
body
once
more
i
ask
you

the
dead
a
murmur
arose
balthazar
alone
ventured
to
approach
the
corpse
luke
started
to
his
feet
as
he
advanced
his
eyes
glaring
with
tiger
fury
back

man
cried
he
and
dare
not
any
of
you
to
lay
a
sacrilegious
finger
on
her

stretch
him

from

to
what
end
i
preserved
it
i
learn

now
it
is
here
and
he
held
forth
a

a
fatal
boon

ring
cried
sybil
such
a
ring
my
mother
on
her
said
should
be
mine
such
a
ring
she
said
should
wed
me
unto
whom
fiercely
demanded
luke
unto
death
she
solemnly
rejoined
luke
countenance
fell
he
turned
aside
deeply
abashed
unable
further
to
brook
her
gaze
while
in
accents
of
such
wildly
touching
pathos
as
sank
into
the
hearts
of
each
who
heard
her
hearts
few
of
them
framed
of
penetrable
stuff
the
despairing
maiden
burst
into
the
following
strain
the
ring
beware
thy
bridal
day
on
her
sighed
my
mother
beware
beware
i
say
death

wed
thee
and
no

be
from
a
finger
taken
from
one
that
like
to
thee
was
by
her
love
forsaken
for
a
ring
is
a
fatal
thing
her
griefs
who

it
are
partaken
beware

sent
a
token
cold
cold
fingers
bring
that
ring
soon
will
a
heart
be
broken
is
my
bridal
day
there
was
a
deep
profound
silence
as
the
last
melancholy
cadence
died
away
and
many
a
rugged
heart
was
melted
even
to
tears
eleanor
meanwhile
remained
in
a
state
of
passive
stupefaction
vacantly
gazing
at
sybil
upon
whom
alone
her
eyes
were
fixed
and
appearing
indistinctly
to
apprehend
the
meaning
of
her
song
this
is
my
bridal
day
murmured
she
in
a
low
tone
when
sybil
had
finished
said
not
that
sweet
voice
so
i
know
is
my
bridal
day
what
a
church
you
have
chosen
mother
a
tomb
a
sepulchre
but
is
meet
for
such
nuptials
as
mine
and
what
wedding
guests
was
that
pale
woman
in
her
dress
invited
here
by
you
tell
me
that
mother
my
god
her
senses
are
gone
cried
mowbray
why
did
i
venture
into
this
horrible
place
ask
not
now
madam
rejoined
the
priest
the
hour
for
consideration
is
past
we
must
act
let
the
marriage
proceed
at
all
hazards
we
will
then
take
means
to
extricate
ourselves
from
this
accursed
place
remove
that
horrible
object
said
mowbray
it
fascinates
the
vision
of
my
child
lend
me
your
hand
richard
checkley
said
peter
sternly
regarding
the
priest
no
no
replied
the
priest
shuddering
i
will
not
can
not
touch
it
do
you
alone
remove
it
peter
approached
luke
the
latter
now
offered
no
further
opposition
and
the
body
was
taken
away
the
eyes
of
eleanor
followed
it
into
the
dark
recesses
of
the
vault
and
when
she
could
no
longer
distinguish
the
white
flutter
of
the
cereclothes
her
laboring
bosom
seemed
torn
asunder
with
the
profound
sigh
that
burst
from
it
and
her
head
declined
upon
her
shoulder
let
me
see
that
ring
said
the
priest
addressing
luke
who
still
held
the
between
his
fingers
i
am
not
naturally
superstitious
said
mowbray
whether
my
mind
be
affected
with
the
horrors
of
this
place
i
know
not
but
i
have
a
dread
of
that
ring
she
shall
not
use
it
where
no
other
can
be
found
said
the
priest
with
a
significant
and
peculiar
look
at
mowbray
i
see
no
reason
why
this
should
be
rejected
i
should
not
have
suspected
you
madam
of
such
weakness
grant
there
were
evil
spell
or
charm
attached
to
it
which
trust
me
there
is
as
how
should
there
be
to
a
harmless
piece
of
gold
my
benediction
and
aspersion
with
holy
lymph
will
have
sufficient
power
to
exorcise
and
expel
it
to
remove
your
fears
it
shall
be
done
at
once
a
cup
containing
water
was
brought
together
with
a
plate
of
salt
which
condiment
the
devil
is
said
to
abhor
and
which
is
held
to
be
a
symbol
of
immortality
and
of
eternity
in
that
being
itself
incorruptible
it
preserves
all
else
from
corruption
and
with
the
customary
romish
formula
of
prayer
and
exorcism
the
priest
thrice
mingled
the
crystal
particles
with
the
pure
fluid
after
which
taking
the
ring
in
his
hand
with
much
solemnity
he
sprinkled
it
with
a
few
drops
of
the
water
which
he
had
blessed
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
upon
the
golden
circlet
uttered
another
and
more
potent
exorcism
to
eradicate
and
expel
every
device
of
satan
and
delivered
it
back
to
luke
she
may
wear
it
now
in
safety
said
the
sexton
with
strong
contempt
were
the
snake
himself
coiled
round
that
consecrated
bauble
the
prayers
of
the
devout
father
checkley
would
unclasp
his
lithest
folds
but
wherefore
do
we
tarry
now
naught
lies
between
us
and
the
altar
the
path
is
clear
the
bridegroom
grows
impatient
and
the
bride
asked
barbara
is
ready
replied
the
priest
madam
delay
not
longer
daughter
your
hand
eleanor
gave
her
hand
it
was
clammy
and
cold
supported
by
her
mother
she
moved
slowly
towards
the
altar
which
was
but
a
few
steps
from
where
they
stood
she
offered
no
resistance
but
did
not
raise
her
head
luke
was
by
her
side
then
for
the
first
time
did
the
enormity
of
the
cruel
dishonorable
act
he
was
about
to
commit
strike
him
with
its
full
force
he
saw
it
in
its
darkest
colors
it
was
one
of
those
terrible
moments
when
the
headlong
wheel
of
passion
stands
suddenly
still
there
is
yet
time
groaned
he
oh
let
me
not
damn
myself
perpetually
let
me
save
her
save
sybil
save
myself
they
were
at
the
altar
that
wild
wedding
train
high
over
head
the
torch
was
raised
the
red
light
flashed
on
bridegroom
and
on
bride
giving
to
the
pale
features
of
each
an
almost
livid
look
it
fell
upon
the
gaunt
aspect
of
the
sexton
and
lit
up
the
smile
of
triumphant
malice
that
played
upon
his
face
it
fell
upon
the
fantastical
habiliments
of
barbara
and
upon
the
haughty
but
perturbed
physiognomy
of
mowbray
it
fell
upon
the
salient
points
of
the
gothic
arches
upon
one
molded
pillar
upon
the
marble
image
of
the
virgin
thecla
and
on
the
scarcely
less
marble
countenance
of
sybil
who
stood
behind
the
altar
silent
immovable
the
effect
of
light
and
shade
on
other
parts
of
the
scene
upon
the
wild
drapery
and
harsh
lineaments
of
many
of
the
group
was
also
eminently
striking
just
as
the
priest
was
about
to
commence
the
marriage
service
a
yelling
chorus
which
the
gipsies
were
accustomed
to
sing
at
the
celebration
of
the
nuptials
of
one
of
their
own
tribe
burst
forth
nothing
could
be
more
horribly
discordant
than
their
song
wedding
chorus
of
gipsies
scrape
the
catgut
pass
the
liquor
let
your
quick
feet
move
the
quicker
dance
and
sing
in
jolly
chorus
bride
and
bridegroom
are
before
us
and
the
patrico
stands
us
to
unite
their
hands
he
ready
for
a
moment
pals
be
steady
cease
your
quaffing
dancing
laughing
leave
off
riot
and
be
quiet
while
is
doing
is
begun
all
is
over
two
are
one
the
patrico
has
link
daddy
hymen
torch
has
blink
amen
to
again
now
for
quaffing
now
for
laughing
liquor
flowing
for
our
bridals
are
no
bridles
and
our
altars
never
alter
from
the
flagon
never
flinch
we
in
the
jig
we
never
falter
no
that
not
way
for
are
staunch
lads
of
romany
for
our
wedding
then
hurrah
hurrah
hurrah
hurrah
this
uncouth
chorus
ended
the
marriage
proceeded
sybil
had
disappeared
had
she
fled
no
she
was
by
the
bride
eleanor
mechanically
took
her
place
a
faint
voice
syllabled
the
responses
you
could
scarcely
have
seen
miss
mowbray
lips
move
but
the
answers
were
given
and
the
priest
was
satisfied
he
took
the
ring
and
sprinkled
it
once
again
with
the
holy
water
in
the
form
of
the
cross
he
pronounced
the
prayer
domine
annulum
hunc
quem
nos
in
tuo
nomine
benedicimus
ut
quæ
eum
gestaverit
fidelitatem
integram
suo
sponso
tenens
in
pace
et
voluntate
tua
permaneat
atque
in
mutua
charitate
semper
he
was
about
to
return
the
ring
to
luke
when
the
torch
held
by
the
knight
of
malta
was
dashed
to
the
ground
by
some
unseen
hand
and
instantly
extinguished
the
wild
pageant
vanished
as
suddenly
as
the
figures
cast
by
a
upon
a
wall
disappear
when
the
glass
is
removed
a
wild
hubbub
succeeded
hoarsely
above
the
clamor
arose
the
voice
of
barbara
to
the
door
quickly
to
the
door
let
no
one
pass
i
will
find
out
the
author
of
this
mishap
anon
away
she
was
obeyed
several
of
the
crew
stationed
themselves
at
the
door
proceed
now
with
the
ceremony
continued
barbara
by
darkness
or
by
light
the
match
shall
be
completed
the
ring
was
then
placed
upon
the
finger
of
the
bride
and
as
luke
touched
it
he
shuddered
it
was
cold
as
that
of
the
corpse
which
he
had
clasped
but
now
the
prayer
was
said
the
blessing
given
the
marriage
was
complete
suddenly
there
issued
from
the
darkness
deep
tones
and
a
voice
solemnly
chanted
a
strain
which
all
knew
to
be
the
of
their
race
hymned
by
wailing
women
over
an
expiring
sister
the
music
seemed
to
float
in
the
air
the
fast
the
sand
of
life
is
falling
fast
her
latest
sigh
exhaling
fast
fast
is
she
dying
with
death
chills
her
limbs
are
shivering
with
death
gasp
the
lips
are
quivering
fast
her
soul
away
is
flying
the
it
fleeteth
and
the
skyey
wonders
greeteth
singing
loud
as
stars
it
meeteth
on
its
way
hark
the
sullen
tolling
hollowly
in
echoes
rolling
seems
to
say
she
will
ope
her
eyes
oh
never
quenched
their
dark
light
gone
for
ever
she
is
dead
the
marriage
group
yet
lingered
near
the
altar
awaiting
it
would
seem
permission
from
the
gipsy
queen
to
quit
the
cell
luke
stirred
not
clasped
in
his
own
the
cold
hand
of
his
bride
detained
him
and
when
he
would
have
moved
her
tightened
grasp
prevented
his
departure
mowbray
patience
was
exhausted
by
the
delay
she
was
not
altogether
free
from
apprehension
why
do
we
linger
here
she
whispered
to
the
priest
do
you
father
lead
the
way
the
crowd
is
dense
replied
checkley
they
resist
my
effort
are
we
prisoners
here
asked
mowbray
in
alarm
let
me
make
the
attempt
cried
luke
with
fiery
impatience
i
will
force
a
passage
out
quit
not
your
bride
whispered
peter
as
you
value
her
safety
heed
not
aught
else
she
alone
is
in
danger
suffer
her
not
to
be
withdrawn
from
your
hand
if
you
would
not
lose
her
remain
here
i
will
bring
the
matter
to
a
speedy
issue
enough
replied
luke
i
stir
not
hence
and
he
drew
his
bride
closer
towards
him
he
stooped
to
imprint
a
kiss
upon
her
lips
a
cold
shudder
ran
through
her
frame
as
he
touched
them
but
she
resisted
not
his
embrace
peter
attempt
to
effect
an
egress
was
as
unsuccessful
as
that
of
the
priest
presenting
excalibur
at
his
bosom
the
knight
of
malta
challenged
him
to
stand
you
can
not
pass
exclaimed
the
knight
our
orders
are
peremptory
what
am
i
to
understand
by
this
said
peter
angrily
why
are
we
detained
you
will
learn
all
anon
returned
barbara
in
the
meantime
you
are
my
prisoners
or
if
you
like
not
the
phrase
my
wedding
guests
the
wedding
is
complete
returned
the
sexton
the
bride
and
bridegroom
are
impatient
to
depart
and
we
the
guests
albeit
some
of
us
may
be
no
foes
to
darkness
desire
not
to
hold
our
nuptial
revels
here
sybil
wedding
has
not
taken
place
said
barbara
you
must
tarry
for
that
ha
now
it
comes
thought
peter
and
who
may
i
ask
said
he
aloud
amongst
this
goodly
company
is
to
be
her
bridegroom
the
best
amongst
them
returned
barbara
sir
luke
rookwood
he
has
a
bride
already
replied
peter
she
may
be
said
barbara
with
bitter
and
peculiar
emphasis
dost
understand
my
meaning
now
i
will
not
understand
it
said
peter
you
can
not
mean
to
destroy
her
who
now
stands
at
the
altar
she
who
now
stands
at
the
altar
must
make
way
for
a
successor
she
who
grasps
the
bridegroom
hand
shall
die
i
swear
it
by
the
oath
of
my
tribe
and
think
you
you
will
be
allowed
to
execute
your
murderous
intention
with
impunity
shrieked
mowbray
in
an
agony
of
terror
think
you
that
i
will
stand
by
and
see
my
child
slaughtered
before
my
face
that
my
friends
will
suffer
it
think
you
that
even
your
own
tribe
will
dare
to
execute
your
horrible
purpose
they
will
not
they
will
side
with
us
even
now
they
murmur
what
can
you
hope
to
gain
by
an
act
so
wild
and
dreadful
what
object
can
you
have
the
same
as
your
own
reiterated
barbara
the
advancement
of
my
child
sybil
is
as
dear
to
me
as
eleanor
is
to
you
she
is
my
child
the
daughter
of
my
best
beloved
daughter
i
have
sworn
to
marry
her
to
sir
luke
rookwood
the
means
are
in
my
power
i
will
keep
my
vow
i
will
wed
her
to
him
you
did
not
hesitate
to
tear
your
daughter
from
the
man
she
loved
to
give
her
to
the
man
she
hated
and
for
what
for
gold
for
power
for
rank
i
have
the
same
motive
i
love
my
child
and
she
loves
sir
luke
has
loved
him
long
and
truly
therefore
shall
she
have
him
what
to
me
is
child
or
feelings
except
they
are
subservient
to
my
wishes
she
stands
in
my
way
i
remove
her
who
placed
her
in
your
path
asked
the
sexton
did
you
not
lend
a
helping
hand
to
create
that
obstacle
yourself
i
did
replied
barbara
would
you
know
wherefore
i
will
tell
you
i
had
a
double
motive
for
it
there
is
a
curse
upon
the
house
of
rookwood
that
kills
the
first
fair
bride
each
generation
leads
to
the
altar
have
you
never
heard
of
it
i
have
and
did
that
idle
legend
sway
you
and
do
you
call
it
idle
well
i
had
another
motive
a
prophecy
by
yourself
uttered
replied
peter
even
so
replied
barbara
the
prophecy
is
fulfilled
the
stray
rook
is
found
the
rook
hath
with
rook
mated
luke
hath
wedded
eleanor
he
will
hold
possession
of
his
lands
the
prophecy
is
fulfilled
but
asked
peter
will
your
art
tell
you
how
and
why
he
shall
now
hold
possession
can
you
tell
me
that
my
art
goes
not
so
far
i
have
predicted
the
event
it
has
come
to
pass
i
am
satisfied
he
has
wedded
her
be
it
mine
to
free
him
from
that
yoke
and
barbara
laughed
exultingly
the
sexton
approached
the
old
crone
and
laid
his
hand
with
violence
upon
her
shoulder
hear
cried
he
and
i
will
tell
you
that
which
your
juggling
art
refuses
to
reveal
eleanor
mowbray
is
heir
to
the
lands
of
rookwood
the
estates
are
they
were
bequeathed
to
her
by
her
grandsire
sir
reginald
she
was
unborn
when
he
died
cried
mowbray
true
replied
peter
but
the
lands
were
left
to
your
issue
should
such
issue
be
born
and
did
sir
piers
my
brother
know
of
this
did
he
see
this
will
asked
mowbray
with
trembling
impatience
he
did
and
withheld
the
knowledge
of
it
from
you
and
yours
ah
why
knew
i
not
this
before
why
did
you
not
tell
me
ere
that
was
done
which
can
not
be
undone
i
have
sacrificed
my
child
because
it
did
not
chime
with
my
purposes
to
tell
you
replied
peter
coldly
it
is
false
it
is
false
cried
mowbray
her
anger
and
vexation
getting
the
better
of
her
fears
i
will
not
believe
it
who
are
you
that
pretend
to
know
the
secrets
of
our
house
one
of
that
house
replied
the
sexton
your
name
would
you
know
my
name
answered
peter
sternly
the
time
is
come
when
i
will
no
longer
conceal
it
i
am
alan
rookwood
my
father

exclaimed
mowbray

i
saw

one
fell
in

i
was
with
him
there
the
other
expired
in
his
bed
i
was
with
sir
piers
when
he
breathed
his
last
and
listened
to
his
death
agonies
was
i
who
counselled
him
to
keep
the
lands
from
you
and
from
your
child
and
he
withheld
them
one
only
amongst
the
race
whose
name
i
have
cast
off

i
loved
and
him
because
added
he
with
something
like
emotion
because
he

rookwood
and
even
he
shall
minister
to
my
vengeance
he
will
be
your
curse

daughter

for
he
loves

not
yet
he
is
her
husband
and

and
he
laughed
till
he
became
convulsed
with
the
paroxysm
of
fiendish
exultation
mine
ears
are
stunned
cried
mowbray
the
bride

said
barbara
advance
and
seize
her

rookwood
for
so
we
shall
henceforth
denominate
the
sexton
suddenly
grew
calm
he
raised
the
whistle
to
his
lips
and
blew
a
call
so
loud
and
shrill
that
those
who
were
advancing
hung
back
irresolute
there
was
a
rush
at
the
door
of
the
vault
the
sentinels
were
struck
down
and
with
pistols
in
each
hand
and
followed
by
two
assistants
dick
turpin
sprang
into
the
thick
of
the
crew

he
ready

several
voices

cried
turpin
laughing
loud
and
long
as
an
olympian
deity
has
this
simple
wench
outwitted

all
turned
the
tables
upon
the
whole
gang
of
plotters
eh

ha
the
next
time
you
wed
sir
luke
let
me
advise
you
not
to
choose
a
wife
in
the
dark
a
man
should
have
all
his
senses
about
him
on
these
occasions
make
love
when

liquor
in
marry
when
it
out
and
above
all
with
your
eyes
open
this
beats
ha
ha
ha
you
must
excuse
me
but
upon
my
soul
i
ca
help
it
and
his
laughter
seemed
inextinguishable
take
your
men
without
whispered
alan
rookwood
keep
watch
as
before
and
let
the
discharge
of
a
pistol
bespeak
the
approach
of
danger
as
agreed
upon
much
yet
remains
to
be
done
here
how
so
asked
dick
it
seems
to
me
the
job
entirely
settled
if
not
to
satisfaction
i
always
ready
to
oblige
my
friend
sir
luke
but
curse
me
if
i
lend
my
help
to
any
underhand
work
steer
clear
of
foul
play
or
dick
turpin
holds
no
hand
with
you
as
to
that
poor
wench
if
you
mean
her
any
harm
curse
me
if
i
will
no
harm
is
intended
her
replied
alan
i
applaud
your
magnanimity
added
he
sarcastically
such
sentiments
are
it
must
be
owned
in
excellent
keeping
with
your
conduct
in
keeping
or
not
replied
turpin
gravely
murder
is
altogether
out
of
my
line
and
i
wash
my
hands
of
it
a
shot
or
two
in
self
defence
is
another
matter
and
when
a
truce
to
this
interrupted
alan
the
girl
is
safe
will
you
mount
guard
again
if
that
be
the
case
certainly
replied
dick
i
shall
be
glad
to
get
back
to
bess
i
could
bring
her
with
me
into
this
black
hole
a
couple
of
shots
will
tell
you
is
ranulph
rookwood
but
mind
no
harm
to
the
gipsy
girl
to
lady
rookwood
i
should
say
she
a
jewel
take
my
word
for
it
which
sir
luke
must
be
mad
to
throw
away
and
calling
his
companions
he
departed
alan
rookwood
bent
his
steps
towards
the
gipsy
queen
dark
thoughts
gathered
quickly
his
brow
he
smiled
as
he
drew
nigh
to
barbara
a
smile
it
was
that
wrinkled
up
his
skin
even
to
the
hair
barbara
looked
at
him
at
first
with
distrust
but
as
he
developed
his
secret
purposes
that
smile
became
reflected
upon
her
own
features
their
conference
took
place
apart
we
willingly
leave
them
to
return
to
the
altar
mowbray
and
the
priest
were
still
there
both
were
occupied
in
ineffectual
endeavors
to
restore
eleanor
to
consciousness
she
recovered
from
her
swoon
but
it
was
evident
her
senses
still
wandered
and
vainly
did
mowbray
lavish
her
tenderest
caresses
upon
her
child
eleanor
returned
them
not
luke
meanwhile
had
given
vent
to
the
wildest
fury
he
shook
away
sybil
grasp
he
dashed
her
from
him
he
regarded
her
with
withering
glances
he
loaded
her
with
reproaches
she
bore
his
violence
with
meekest
submission
she
looked
imploringly
but
she
replied
not
to
his
taunts
again
she
clung
to
the
hem
of
his
garment
when
cast
aside
luke
appeared
unmoved
what
passed
within
we
pause
not
to
examine
he
grew
calmer
his
calmness
was
more
terrible
to
sybil
than
his
previous
wrath
had
been
you
are
my
wife
said
he
what
then
by
fraud
by
stratagem
you
have
obtained
that
title
and
perforce
must
keep
it
but
the
title
shall
you
retain
no
rights
of
wife
shall
ever
be
yours
it
will
be
in
your
power
to
call
yourself
lady
rookwood
you
will
be
so
in
name
in
nothing
else
i
shall
not
bear
it
long
murmured
sybil
luke
laughed
scornfully
so
you
said
before
replied
he
and
yet
i
see
not
why
you
are
likely
to
abandon
it
the
event
will
show
thus
far
you
have
deceived
me
and
i
place
no
further
faith
in
your
assertions
my
hand
was
yours
you
refused
it
when
i
would
give
it
to
another
you
grasp
it
clandestinely
am
i
to
believe
you
now
the
wind
will
change
the
vane
veer
with
it
it
will
not
veer
from
you
she
meekly
answered
why
did
you
step
between
me
and
my
bride
to
save
her
life
to
lay
down
mine
for
hers
an
idle
subterfuge
you
know
well
that
you
run
no
risk
of
being
called
upon
to
do
so
your
life
is
in
no
danger
the
sacrifice
was
unnecessary
i
could
have
dispensed
with
assistance
my
own
arm
would
have
sufficed
to
protect
eleanor
your
single
arm
would
not
have
prevailed
against
numbers
they
would
have
killed
you
likewise
tush
said
luke
fiercely
not
only
have
you
snatched
from
me
my
bride
you
have
robbed
me
of
my
fair
estates
of
all
save
of
my
barren
title
and
that
even
you
have
tarnished
true
true
sighed
sybil
i
knew
not
that
the
lands
were
hers
else
had
i
never
done
it
false
false
cried
luke
false
as
the
rest
will
be
ranulph
will
be
ranulph
i
shall
still
be
an
outcast
while
ranulph
will
riot
in
my
halls
will
press
her
to
his
bosom
cling
not
to
me
hence
or
i
will
spurn
you
from
me
i
am
undone
undone
by
you
accursed
one
oh
curse
me
not
your
words
cut
deep
enough
would
they
could
kill
you
cried
luke
with
savage
bitterness
you
have
placed
a
bar
between
me
and
my
prospects
which
nothing
can
now
remove
nothing
but
ha
and
his
countenance
assumed
a
deadly
hue
and
fearful
expression
by
heaven
you
almost
rouse
the
fell
spirit
which
it
is
said
dwells
within
the
breast
of
my
devoted
race
i
feel
as
if
i
could
stab
thee
no
no
shrieked
sybil
for
mercy
sake
for
your
own
sake
do
not
stab
me
it
is
not
too
late
i
will
repair
my
wrong
ever
deceiving
you
would
again
delude
me
you
can
not
repair
it
one
way
alone
remains
and
that
i
will
pursue
responded
sybil
sadly
but
firmly
never
cried
luke
you
shall
not
ha
exclaimed
he
as
he
found
his
arms
suddenly
pinioned
behind
him
what
new
treachery
is
this
by
whose
orders
am
i
thus
fettered
by
mine
said
alan
rookwood
stepping
forward
by
yours
echoed
luke
and
wherefore
release
me
be
patient
replied
alan
you
will
hear
all
anon
in
the
meantime
you
must
be
content
to
remain
my
prisoner
quit
not
your
hold
added
he
addressing
the
gipsies
who
kept
charge
of
luke
their
lives
shall
answer
for
their
obedience
said
barbara
upon
a
further
signal
from
alan
eleanor
was
torn
from
her
arms
and
a
bandage
passed
so
suddenly
over
mowbray
face
that
before
she
could
raise
a
cry
of
alarm
all
possibility
of
utterance
was
effectually
prevented
the
priest
alone
was
left
at
liberty
barbara
snatched
the
hand
of
eleanor
she
dragged
her
to
sybil
you
are
lady
rookwood
whispered
she
but
she
has
your
domains
i
give
her
to
you
she
is
the
between
thy
husband
and
his
rights
whispered
alan
rookwood
in
a
tone
of
horrible
irony
is
not
too
late
to
repair
your
away
tempter
cried
sybil
i
know
you
well
yet
continued
she
in
an
altered
tone
i
will
risk
all
for
him
i
have
done
him
wrong
one
mode
of
atonement
remains
and
horrible
though
it
be
i
will
embrace
it
let
me
not
pause
give
her
to
me
and
she
seized
upon
the
unresisting
hand
of
eleanor
do
you
need
my
aid
asked
barbara
no
replied
sybil
let
none
approach
us
a
clapping
of
hands
will
let
you
know
when
all
is
over
and
she
dragged
her
passive
victim
deeper
into
the
vault
sybil
sybil
cried
luke
struggling
with
frantic
violence
to
liberate
himself
hurt
her
not
i
was
rash
i
was
mad
i
am
calmer
now
she
hears
me
not
she
will
not
turn
god
of
heaven
she
will
murder
her
it
will
be
done
while
i
speak
i
am
the
cause
of
all
release
me
villains
would
that
i
had
died
ere
i
had
seen
this
day
at
a
signal
from
the
sexton
luke
also
was
blindfolded
he
ceased
to
struggle
but
his
laboring
breast
told
of
the
strife
within
miscreants
exclaimed
the
priest
who
had
hitherto
witnessed
the
proceedings
in
horror
why
do
not
these
rocks
fall
in
and
crush
you
and
your
iniquities
save
her
oh
save
her
have
you
no
pity
for
the
innocent
such
pity
have
we
replied
alan
rookwood
as
you
showed
my
daughter
she
was
as
innocent
as
eleanor
mowbray
and
yet
you
did
not
pity
heaven
is
my
witness
exclaimed
the
priest
that
i
never
injured
her
take
not
heaven
name
in
vain
cried
alan
who
stood
by
while
it
was
doing
whose
firmer
hand
lent
aid
to
the
murderer
trembling
efforts
whose
pressure
stifled
her
thrilling
screams
and
choked
her
cries
for
mercy
yours
yours
and
now
you
prate
to
me
of
pity
you
the
slayer
of
the
sleeping
and
the
innocent
is
false
exclaimed
the
priest
in
extremity
of
terror
false
echoed
alan
i
had
sir
piers
own
confession
he
told
me
all
you
had
designs
upon
sir
piers
which
his
wife
opposed
you
hated
her
you
were
in
the
confidence
of
both
how
did
you
keep
that
confidence
he
told
me
by
awakening
a
spirit
of
jealousy
and
pride
that
all
his
better
feelings
false
he
told
me
of
your
hellish
machinations
your
jesuitical
plots
your
schemes
he
was
too
weak
too
feeble
an
instrument
to
serve
you
you
left
him
but
not
before
had
left
him
false
ha
i
have
that
shall
instantly
convict
you
the
corpse
is
here
within
this
cell
who
brought
it
hither
the
priest
was
silent
he
seemed
confounded
by
alan
violence
i
will
answer
that
question
said
barbara
it
was
brought
hither
by
that
false
priest
his
agent
balthazar
has
betrayed
him
it
was
brought
hither
to
prevent
the
discovery
of
sir
luke
legitimacy
he
meant
to
make
his
own
terms
about
it
it
has
come
hither
to
proclaim
his
guilt
to
be
a
fearful
witness
against
him
then
turning
to
checkley
she
added
you
have
called
heaven
to
witness
your
innocence
you
shall
attest
it
by
oath
upon
that
body
and
should
aught
indicate
your
guilt
i
will
hang
you
as
i
would
a
dog
and
clear
off
one
long
score
with
justice
do
you
shrink
from
this
no
replied
the
priest
in
a
voice
hollow
and
broken
bring
me
to
the
body
seize
each
an
arm
said
barbara
addressing
zoroaster
and
the
knight
of
malta
and
lead
him
to
the
corse
i
will
administer
the
oath
said
alan
rookwood
sternly
no
not
you
stammered
the
priest
and
wherefore
not
asked
alan
if
you
are
innocent
you
need
fear
nothing
from
her
i
fear
nothing
from
the
replied
checkley
lead
on
we
will
now
return
to
sybil
she
was
alone
with
her
victim
they
were
near
the
mouth
of
the
cell
which
had
been
prior
cyprian
flinty
dormitory
and
were
almost
involved
in
darkness
a
broken
stream
of
light
glanced
through
the
pillars
eleanor
had
not
spoken
she
suffered
herself
to
be
dragged
thither
without
resistance
scarcely
conscious
it
would
seem
of
her
danger
sybil
gazed
upon
her
for
some
minutes
with
sorrow
and
surprise
she
comprehends
not
her
perilous
situation
murmured
sybil
she
knows
not
that
she
stands
upon
the
brink
of
the
grave
oh
would
that
she
could
pray
shall
i
her
murderess
pray
for
her
my
prayers
would
not
be
heard
and
yet
to
kill
her
unshriven
will
be
a
twofold
crime
let
me
not
look
on
her
my
hand
trembles
i
can
scarce
grasp
the
dagger
let
me
think
on
all
he
has
said
i
have
wronged
him
i
am
his
bane
his
curse
i
have
robbed
him
of
all
there
is
but
one
remedy
is
oh
god
she
recovers
i
can
not
do
it
now
it
was
a
fearful
moment
for
eleanor
revival
when
the
bright
steel
flashed
before
her
eyes
terror
at
once
restored
her
she
cast
herself
at
sybil
feet
spare
spare
me
cried
she
oh
what
a
dream
i
have
had
and
to
waken
thus
with
the
dagger
point
at
my
breast
you
will
not
kill
me
you
gentle
maid
who
promised
to
preserve
me
ah
no
i
am
sure
you
will
not
appeal
no
more
to
me
said
sybil
fiercely
make
your
peace
with
heaven
your
minutes
are
numbered
i
can
not
pray
said
eleanor
while
you
are
near
me
will
you
pray
if
i
retire
and
leave
you
no
no
i
dare
not
can
not
shrieked
eleanor
in
extremity
of
terror
oh
do
not
leave
me
or
let
me
go
if
you
stir
said
sybil
i
stab
you
to
the
heart
i
will
not
stir
i
will
kneel
here
forever
stab
me
as
i
kneel
as
i
pray
to
you
you
can
not
kill
me
while
i
cling
to
you
thus
while
i
kiss
your
hands
while
i
bedew
them
with
my
tears
those
tears
will
not
sully
them
like
my
blood
maiden
said
sybil
endeavoring
to
withdraw
her
hand
let
go
your
hold
your
sand
is
run
mercy
it
is
in
vain
close
your
eyes
no
i
will
fix
them
on
you
thus
you
can
not
strike
then
i
will
cling
to
you
embrace
you
your
nature
is
not
cruel
your
soul
is
full
of
pity
it
melts
those
tears
you
will
be
merciful
you
can
not
deliberately
kill
me
i
can
not
i
can
not
said
sybil
with
a
passionate
outburst
of
grief
take
your
life
on
one
condition
name
it
that
you
wed
sir
luke
rookwood
ah
exclaimed
eleanor
all
rushes
back
upon
me
at
that
name
the
whole
of
that
fearful
scene
passes
in
review
before
me
do
you
reject
my
proposal
i
dare
not
i
must
have
your
oath
swear
by
every
hope
of
eternity
that
you
will
wed
none
other
than
him
by
every
hope
i
swear
it
handassah
you
will
bear
this
maiden
oath
in
mind
and
witness
its
fulfilment
i
will
replied
the
gipsy
girl
stepping
forward
from
a
recess
in
which
she
had
hitherto
remained
unnoticed
enough
i
am
satisfied
tarry
with
me
stir
not
scream
not
whatever
you
may
see
or
hear
your
life
depends
upon
your
firmness
when
i
am
no
more
no
more
echoed
eleanor
in
horror
be
calm
said
sybil
when
i
am
dead
clap
your
hands
together
they
will
come
to
seek
you
they
will
find
me
in
your
stead
then
rush
to
him
to
sir
luke
rookwood
he
will
protect
you
say
to
him
hereafter
that
i
died
for
the
wrong
i
did
him
that
i
died
and
blessed
him
can
you
not
live
and
save
me
sobbed
eleanor
ask
it
not
while
i
live
your
life
is
in
danger
when
i
am
gone
none
will
seek
to
harm
you
fare
you
well
remember
your
oath
and
you
too
remember
it
handassah
remember
also
ha
that
groan
all
started
as
a
deep
groan
knelled
in
their
ears
whence
comes
that
sound
cried
sybil
hist
a
voice
it
is
that
of
the
priest
cried
eleanor
hark
he
groans
they
have
murdered
him
kind
heaven
receive
his
soul
pray
for
me
cried
sybil
pray
fervently
avert
your
face
down
on
your
knees
down
down
farewell
handassah
and
breaking
from
them
she
rushed
into
the
darkest
recesses
of
the
vault
we
must
now
quit
this
painful
scene
for
another
scarcely
less
painful
and
return
to
the
unfortunate
priest
checkley
had
been
brought
before
the
body
of
susan
rookwood
even
in
the
gloom
the
shimmer
of
the
white
cereclothes
and
the
pallid
features
of
the
corpse
were
ghastly
enough
the
torchlight
made
them
terrible
kneel
said
alan
rookwood
the
priest
complied
alan
knelt
beside
him
do
you
know
these

that
faith

torch
be
removed

innocence

be
more
deeply
attested
continued
he
as
the
light
was
withdrawn
this
proof

not
fail
entwine
your
fingers
round
her
throat
have
i
not
done
enough
your
hesitation
proves
your
guilt
said
alan
that
proof
is
wanting
then
returned
the
priest

hand
is
upon
her
throat
what
more
as

for
mercy
in
your
hour
of
need
swear
that
you
never
conspired
against
her
life
or
refused
her
mercy

swear

dead
convict
you
of
perjury

forsworn
yourself
said
alan

away
your
hand

what
is
this
exclaimed
the
priest
you
have
put
some
jugglery
upon
me
i
can
not
withdraw
my
hand
it
sticks
to
her
throat
as
though
glued
by
blood
tear
me
away
i
have
not
force
enough
to
liberate
myself
why
do
you
grin
at
me
the
corpse
grins
likewise
it
is
jugglery
i
am
innocent
you
would
take
away
my
life

away
i
say
the
veins
rise

blacken
they
are
filling
with
new
blood

things
around

fingers

alive

ravings
convict

for
jesu
sake

but

i
hold

groaned
the
priest
your
grasp
tightens
round
my
throat
your
hard
and
skinny
fingers
are
there
i
strangle
help
your
own
fears
strangle
you
my
hand
is
at
my
side
returned
alan
calmly
villain
you
lie
your
grasp
is
like
a
vice
the
strength
of
a
thousand
devils
is
in
your
hand
will
none
lend
help
i
never
pressed
so
hard
your
daughter
never
suffered
this
torture
never
never
i
choke
choke
oh
and
the
priest
rolled
heavily
backwards
there
was
a
deep
groan
a
convulsive
rattle
in
the
throat
and
all
was
still
he
is
dead
strangled
cried
several
voices
holding
down
the
torch
the
face
of
the
priest
was
blackened
and
contorted
his
eyeballs
protruded
from
their
sockets
his
tongue
was
nearly
bitten
through
in
the
desperate
efforts
he
had
made
to
release
himself
from
alan
gripe
his
hair
was
erect
with
horror
it
was
a
ghastly
sight
a
murmur
arose
amongst
the
gipsies
barbara
deemed
it
prudent
to
appease
them
he
was
guilty
cried
she
he
was
the
murderer
of
susan
rookwood
and
i
have
avenged
her
said
alan
sternly
the
dreadful
silence
that
followed
this
speech
was
broken
by
the
report
of
a
pistol
the
sound
though
startling
was
felt
almost
as
a
relief
we
are
beset
cried
alan
some
of
you
fly
to
reconnoitre
to
your
posts
cried
barbara
several
of
the
crew
flocked
to
the
entrance
unbind
the
prisoners
shouted
alan
mowbray
and
luke
were
accordingly
set
free
two
almost
simultaneous
reports
of
a
pistol
were
now
heard
is
ranulph
rookwood
said
alan
that
was
the
preconcerted
signal
ranulph
rookwood
echoed
eleanor
who
caught
the
exclamation
he
comes
to
save
me
remember
your
oath
gasped
a
dying
voice
he
is
no
longer
yours
alas
alas
sobbed
eleanor
tremblingly
a
moment
afterwards
a
faint
clapping
of
hands
reached
the
ears
of
barbara
all
is
over
muttered
she
ha
exclaimed
alan
rookwood
with
a
frightful
look
is
it
done
barbara
motioned
him
towards
the
further
end
of
the
vault
look
captain
here
comes
one
of
the
bloodhounds
of
justice
down
with
him
do
let
him
utter
a
word
silence
i
will
hear
him
schiller
gladly
do
we
now
exchange
the
dank
atmosphere
of
saint
cyprian
cell
and
the
horrors
which
have
detained
us
there
so
long
for
balmy
air
genial
sunshine
and
the
boon
companionship
of
dick
turpin
upon
regaining
the
verdant
ruins
of
the
ancient
priory
all
appeared
pretty
much
as
our
highwayman
had
left
it
dick
wended
towards
his
mare
black
bess
uttered
an
affectionate
whinnying
sound
as
he
approached
her
and
yielded
her
sleek
neck
to
his
caresses
no
bedouin
arab
ever
loved
his
horse
more
tenderly
than
turpin
be
a
hard
day
when
thou
and
i
part
murmured
he
affectionately
patting
her
soft
and
silky
cheeks
bess
thrust
her
nose
into
his
hand
biting
him
playfully
as
much
as
to
say
that
day
will
never
arrive
turpin
at
least
understood
the
appeal
in
that
sense
he
was
skilled
in
the
language
of
the
houyhnhnms
i
would
rather
lose
my
right
hand
than
should
happen
sighed
he
but
there
no
saying
the
best
of
friends
must
part
and
thou
and
i
may
be
one
day
separated
thy
destination
is
the
knacker
mine
perhaps
the
we
are
neither
of
us
cut
out
for
old
age
that
certain
curse
me
if
i
can
tell
how
it
is
since
i
been
in
that
vault
i
got
some
queer
crotchet
into
my
head
i
ca
help
likening
thee
to
that
poor
gipsy
wench
sybil
but
may
i
be
scragged
if
i
use
thee
as
her
lover
has
used
her
ha
exclaimed
he
drawing
a
pistol
with
a
suddenness
that
made
his
companions
rust
and
wilder
start
we
are
watched
see
you
not
how
yon
shadow
falls
from
behind
the
wall
i
do
replied
rust
the
varmint
shall
be
speedily
unearthed
said
wilder
rushing
to
the
spot
in
another
instant
the
shadow
manifested
itself
in
a
substantial
little
personage
booted
spurred
and
he
was
brought
before
our
highwayman
who
had
meanwhile
vaulted
into
his
saddle
mr
coates
cried
dick
bursting
into
a
loud
laugh
at
the
ridiculous
figure
presented
to
his
view
or
the
mud
deceives
me

does
not
deceive

the

rejoined
coates
unable
even
in
his
distress
to
resist
the
quibble

it
was
replied
turpin
readily
and
that

the

he
searching
the

pockets
a
brace
of
barkers
handing
a

of
pistols
to

a

and
a
pewter
sneezer

this
continued
dick
as
unfolding
another
leaf
of
the
he
chanced
upon
a
letter
my
lady
superscription
excuse

coates
i
must
have
a
peep
at

all
safe
with

a
moment
longer

take
charge

replied
coates

to
be
my
reader
bravo
cried
turpin
you
may
jest
now
with
impunity
coates
you
have
paid
dear
enough
for
your
jokes
and
when
should
a
man
be
allowed
to
be
pleasant
if
not
at
his
own
expense
ha
ha
what
this
exclaimed
he
opening
the
letter
a
ring
as
i
awake
and
from
her
ladyship
own
fair
finger
i
be
sworn
for
it
bears
her
cipher
ineffaceably
impressed
as
your
image
upon
her
heart
eh
coates
egad
you
are
a
lucky
dog
after
all
to
receive
a
favor
from
a
lady
ha
ha
meantime
i
take
care
of
it
for
you
continued
dick
slipping
the
ring
on
his
little
finger
turpin
we
have
before
remarked
had
a
turn
for
mimicry
and
it
was
with
an
irresistible
feeling
of
deferential
awe
creeping
over
him
that
coates
heard
the
contents
of
lady
rookwood
epistle
delivered
with
an
enunciation
as
peremptory
and
imperious
as
that
of
her
ladyship
self
the
letter
was
hastily
indited
in
a
clear
firm
hand
and
partook
of
its
writer
decision
of
character
dick
found
no
difficulty
in
deciphering
it
thus
ran
the
missive
assured
of
your
devotion
and
secrecy
i
commit
my
own
honor
and
that
of
my
son
to
your
charge
time
will
not
permit
me
to
see
you
or
i
would
not
write
but
i
place
myself
entirely
in
your
hands
you
will
not
dare
to
betray
my
confidence
to
the
point
a
major
mowbray
has
just
arrived
here
with
intelligence
that
the
body
of
susan
bradley
you
will
know
to
whom
i
allude
has
been
removed
from
our
family
vault
by
a
romish
priest
and
his
assistants
how
it
came
there
or
why
it
has
been
removed
i
know
not
it
is
not
my
present
purpose
to
inquire
suffice
it
that
it
now
lies
in
a
vault
beneath
the
ruins
of
davenham
priory
my
son
sir
ranulph
who
has
lent
a
credulous
ear
to
the
artful
tales
of
the
impostor
who
calls
this
woman
mother
is
at
present
engaged
in
arming
certain
of
the
household
and
of
the
tenantry
to
seize
upon
and
bring
away
this
body
as
resistance
is
apprehended
from
a
horde
of
gipsies
who
infest
the
ruins
now
mark
me
that
body
must
not
be
found
be
it
your
business
to
prevent
its
discovery
take
the
fleetest
horse
you
can
procure
spare
neither
whip
nor
spur
haste
to
the
priory
procure
by
any
means
and
at
any
expense
the
assistance
of
the
gipsies
find
out
the
body
conceal
it
destroy
it
do
what
you
will
so
my
son
find
it
not
fear
not
his
resentment
i
will
bear
you
harmless
of
the
consequences
with
him
you
will
act
upon
my
responsibility
i
pledge
my
honor
for
your
safety
use
all
despatch
and
calculate
upon
due
requital
from
maud
rookwood
haste
and
god
speed
you
god
speed
you
echoed
dick
in
his
own
voice
contemptuously
the
devil
drive
you
would
have
been
a
fitter
postscript
and
it
was
upon
this
precious
errand
you
came
mr
coates
precisely
replied
the
attorney
but
i
find
the
premises
preoccupied
fast
as
i
have
ridden
you
are
here
before
me
and
what
do
you
now
propose
to
do
asked
turpin
bargain
with
you
for
the
body
replied
coates
in
an
insinuating
tone
with
said
dick
do
you
take
me
for
a
resurrection
cove
for
a
dealer
in
dead
stock
eh
sirrah
i
take
you
for
one
sufficiently
in
a
general
way
to
his
own
interests
returned
coates
these
gentlemen
may
not
perhaps
be
quite
so
scrupulous
when
they
hear
my
proposals
be
silent
sir
interrupted
turpin
hist
i
hear
the
tramp
of
hoofs
without
hark
that
shout
make
your
own
terms
before
they
come
said
coates
leave
all
to
me
i
put
on
a
wrong
scent
to
the
devil
with
your
terms
cried
turpin
the
signal
and
he
pulled
the
trigger
of
one
of
coates
pistols
the
shot
of
which
rang
in
the
ears
of
the
astounded
attorney
as
it
whizzed
past
him
drag
him
into
the
mouth
of
the
vault
thundered
turpin
he
will
be
a
capital
cover
in
case
of
attack
look
to
your
sticks
and
be
on
the
alert
away
vainly
did
the
unfortunate
attorney
kick
and
struggle
swear
and
scream
his
hat
was
pushed
over
his
eyes
his
thrust
into
his
mouth
and
his
legs
tripped
from
under
him
thus
blind
dumb
and
he
was
hurried
into
the
entrance
of
the
cell
dick
meanwhile
dashed
to
the
arched
outlet
of
the
ruin
he
there
drew
in
the
rein
and
black
bess
stood
motionless
as
a
statue
many
a
fine
fellow
with
a
genius
extensive
enough
to
have
effected
universal
reformation
has
been
doomed
to
perish
by
the
halter
but
does
not
such
a
man
renown
extend
through
centuries
and
tens
of
centuries
while
many
a
prince
would
be
overlooked
in
history
were
it
not
the
historian
interest
to
increase
the
number
of
his
pages
nay
when
the
traveller
sees
a
gibbet
does
he
not
exclaim
that
fellow
was
no
fool
and
lament
the
hardship
of
the
times
schiller
turpin
quick
eye
ranged
over
the
spreading
sward
in
front
of
the
ancient
priory
and
his
brow
became
contracted
the
feeling
however
was
transient
the
next
instant
saw
him
the
same
easy
reckless
being
he
had
been
before
there
was
a
little
more
paleness
in
his
cheek
than
usual
but
his
look
was
keener
and
his
knees
involuntarily
clasped
the
saddle
more
firmly
no
other
symptom
of
anxiety
was
perceptible
it
would
be
no
impeachment
to
dick
valor
were
it
necessary
to
admit
that
a
slight
tremor
crossed
him
as
he
scanned
the
formidable
array
of
his
opponents
the
admission
is
needless
dick
himself
would
have
been
the
last
man
to
own
it
nor
shall
we
do
the
memory
of
our
undaunted
highwayman
any
such
injustice
turpin
was
intrepid
to
a
fault
he
was
rash
apt
to
run
into
risks
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
getting
out
of
them
danger
was
his
delight
and
the
degree
of
excitement
was
always
in
proportion
to
the
peril
incurred
after
the
first
glance
he
became
to
use
his
own
expressive
phrase
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
and
continued
as
long
as
they
permitted
him
like
a
skilful
commander
calmly
to
calculate
the
numerical
strength
of
his
adversaries
and
to
arrange
his
own
plan
of
resistance
this
troop
of
horsemen
for
such
it
was
might
probably
amount
in
the
aggregate
to
twenty
men
and
presented
an
appearance
like
that
of
a
strong
muster
at
a
rustic
due
allowance
being
made
for
the
various
weapons
of
offence
naked
sabers
firelocks
and
a
world
of
huge
which
the
present
carried
along
with
them
this
resemblance
was
heightened
by
the
presence
of
an
old
huntsman
and
a
gamekeeper
or
two
in
scarlet
and
green
jackets
and
a
few
yelping
hounds
that
had
followed
after
them
the
majority
of
the
crew
consisted
of
sturdy
yeomen
some
of
whom
mounted
upon
wild
unbroken
colts
had
pretty
lives
of
it
to
maintain
their
seats
and
curvetted
about
in
most
admired
disorder
others
were
seated
upon
more
docile
but
quite
as
provoking
specimens
of
the
breed
whose
sluggish
sides
reckless
alike
of
hobnailed
heel
or
ash
sapling
refused
to
obey
their
riders
intimations
to
move
while
others
again
brought
stiff
ponies
to
the
charge
obstinate
impracticable
little
brutes
who
seemed
to
prefer
revolving
on
their
own
axis
and
describing
absurd
rotatory
motions
to
proceeding
in
the
direct
and
proper
course
pointed
out
to
them
dick
could
scarcely
forbear
laughing
at
these
ridiculous
manœuvres
but
his
attention
was
chiefly
attracted
towards
three
individuals
who
were
evidently
the
leaders
of
this
warlike
expedition
in
the
thin
tall
figure
of
the
first
of
these
he
recognized
ranulph
rookwood
with
the
features
and
person
of
the
second
of
the
group
he
was
not
entirely
unacquainted
and
fancied
nor
incorrectly
fancied
that
his
military
bearing
or
as
he
would
have
expressed
it
the
cut
of
his
jib
could
belong
to
no
other
than
major
mowbray
whom
he
had
once
eased
of
a
purse
on
finchley
common
in
the
round
rosy
countenance
and
robustious
person
of
the
last
of
the
trio
he
discovered
his
ancient
ally
titus
tyrconnel
ah
titus
my
jewel
are
you
there
exclaimed
dick
as
he
distinguished
the
irishman
come
i
have
friend
among
them
whom
i
may
welcome
so
they
see
me
now
off
they
come
back
bess
back
slowly
wench
slowly
there
stand
and
bess
again
remained
motionless
the
report
of
turpin
pistol
reached
the
ears
of
the
troop
and
as
all
were
upon
the
alert
he
had
scarcely
presented
himself
at
the
gateway
when
a
loud
shout
was
raised
and
the
whole
cavalcade
galloped
towards
him
creating
as
may
be
imagined
the
wildest
disorder
each
horseman
yelling
as
he
neared
the
arch
and
got
involved
in
the
press
occasioned
by
the
unexpected
concentration
of
forces
at
that
point
while
oaths
and
blows
kicks
and
cuffs
were
reciprocated
with
such
hearty
that
had
turpin
ever
read
ariosto
or
cervantes
or
heard
of
the
discord
of
king
agramante
camp
this
must
have
struck
him
as
its
realization
as
it
was
entertaining
little
apprehension
of
the
result
he
shouted
encouragement
to
them
scarcely
however
had
the
foremost
horseman
disentangled
himself
from
the
crowd
and
struggling
to
the
door
was
in
the
act
of
levelling
his
pistol
at
turpin
head
when
a
ball
pierced
the
brain
of
his
charger
and
horse
and
man
rolled
to
the
ground
vowing
vengeance
a
second
succeeded
and
was
in
like
manner
compelled
to
bite
the
dust
that
will
let
old
peter
know
that
ranulph
rookwood
is
at
hand
exclaimed
dick
i
sha
throw
away
another
shot
the
scene
at
the
archway
was
now
one
of
complete
confusion
terrified
by
the
shots
some
of
the
boors
would
have
drawn
back
while
others
in
mid
career
advanced
and
propelled
them
forwards
it
was
like
the
meeting
of
two
tides
here
and
there
regardless
of
the
bit
and
scared
by
the
firing
a
wild
colt
broke
all
bounds
and
hurling
his
rider
in
the
air
darted
off
into
the
green
or
in
another
case
rushed
forward
and
encountering
the
prostrate
cattle
cumbering
the
entrance
to
the
priory
hall
stumbled
and
precipitated
his
master
at
the
very
feet
of
his
enemy
during
all
this
tumult
a
few
shots
were
fired
at
the
highwayman
which
without
doing
him
a
jot
of
mischief
tended
materially
to
increase
their
own
confusion
the
voice
of
turpin
was
now
heard
above
the
din
and
turmoil
to
sound
a
parley
and
as
he
appeared
disposed
to
offer
no
opposition
some
of
his
antagonists
ventured
to
raise
themselves
from
the
ground
and
to
approach
him
i
demand
to
be
led
to
sir
ranulph
rookwood
said
turpin
he
is
here
said
ranulph
riding
up
villain
you
are
my
prisoner
as
you
list
sir
ranulph
returned
dick
coolly
but
let
me
have
a
word
in
private
with
you
ere
you
do
aught
you
may
repent
hereafter
no
words
sir
deliver
up
your
arms
or
my
pistols
are
at
your
service
replied
dick
i
have
just
discharged
them
you
may
have
others
we
must
search
you
hold
cried
dick
if
you
will
not
listen
to
me
read
that
paper
and
he
handed
ranulph
his
mother
letter
to
coates
it
was
without
the
superscription
which
he
had
thrown
aside
my
mother
hand
exclaimed
ranulph
reddening
with
anger
as
he
hastily
perused
its
contents
and
she
sent
this
to
you
you
lie
villain
is
a
forgery
let
this
speak
for
me
returned
dick
holding
out
the
finger
upon
which
lady
rookwood
ring
was
placed
know
you
that
cipher
you
have
stolen
it
retorted
ranulph
my
mother
added
he
in
a
deep
stern
whisper
articulated
only
for
turpin
hearing
would
never
have
entrusted
her
honor
to
a
highwayman
keeping
she
has
entrusted
more
her
life
replied
dick
in
a
careless
tone
she
would
have
bribed
me
to
do
murder
murder
echoed
ranulph
aghast
ay
to
murder
your
brother
returned
dick
but
let
that
pass
you
have
read
that
note
i
have
acted
solely
upon
your
responsibility
lady
rookwood
is
pledged
for
my
safety
of
course
her
son
will
set
me
free
never
well
as
you
please
your
mother
is
in
my
power
betray
me
and
you
betray
her
no
more
returned
ranulph
sternly
go
your
ways
you
are
free
pledge
me
your
word
of
honor
i
am
safe
ranulph
had
scarcely
given
his
pledge
when
major
mowbray
rode
furiously
up
a
deep
flush
of
anger
burnt
upon
his
cheeks
his
sword
was
drawn
in
his
hand
he
glanced
at
turpin
as
if
he
would
have
felled
him
from
his
saddle
this
is
the
ruffian
cried
the
major
fiercely
by
whom
i
was
attacked
some
months
ago
and
for
whose
apprehension
the
reward
of
three
hundred
pounds
is
offered
by
his
majesty
proclamation
with
a
free
pardon
to
his
accomplices
this
is
richard
turpin
he
has
just
added
another
crime
to
his
many
offences
he
has
robbed
my
mother
and
sister
the
postboy
knew
him
the
moment
he
came
up
where
are
they
villain
whither
are
they
gone
answer
i
know
not
replied
turpin
calmly
did
not
the
lad
tell
you
they
were
rescued
rescued
by
whom
asked
ranulph
with
great
emotion
by
one
who
calls
himself
sir
luke
rookwood
answered
turpin
with
a
meaning
smile
by
him
ejaculated
ranulph
where
are
they
now
i
have
already
answered
that
question
said
dick
i
repeat
i
know
not
you
are
my
prisoner
cried
the
major
seizing
turpin
bridle
i
have
sir
ranulph
word
for
my
safety
rejoined
turpin
let
go
my
rein
how
is
this
asked
major
mowbray
incredulously
ask
me
not
release
him
replied
ranulph
ranulph
said
the
major
you
ask
an
impossibility
my
honor
my
duty
is
implicated
in
this
man
capture
the
honor
of
all
of
us
is
involved
in
his
deliverance
returned
ranulph
in
a
whisper
let
him
go
i
will
explain
all
hereafter
let
us
search
for
them
for
eleanor
surely
after
this
you
will
help
us
to
find
them
added
he
addressing
turpin
i
wish
with
all
my
soul
i
could
do
so
replied
the
highwayman
i
see
the
ladies
cross
the
brook
and
enter
these
old
ruins
interposed
the
postboy
who
had
now
joined
the
party
i
see
from
where
i
stood
on
the
and
as
i
kept
a
pretty
sharp
and
have
a
tolerably
bright
eye
of
my
own
i
do
think
as
how
they
ever
comed
out
again
some
one
is
hidden
within
yon
fissure
in
the
wall
exclaimed
ranulph
i
see
a
figure
move
and
he
flung
himself
from
his
horse
rushing
towards
the
mouth
of
the
cell
imitating
his
example
major
mowbray
followed
his
friend
sword
in
hand
the
game
begins
now
in
right
earnest
said
dick
to
himself
the
old
fox
will
be
soon
unearthed
i
must
look
to
my
snappers
and
he
thrust
his
hand
quietly
into
his
pocket
in
search
of
a
pistol
just
as
ranulph
and
the
major
reached
the
recess
they
were
startled
by
the
sudden
apparition
of
the
attorney
mr
coates
exclaimed
ranulph
in
surprise
what
do
you
here
sir
i
i
that
is
sir
ranulph
you
must
excuse
me
sir
particular
business
ca
say
returned
the
trembling
attorney
for
at
this
instant
his
eye
caught
that
of
turpin
and
the
ominous
reflexion
of
a
barrel
held
carelessly
towards
him
he
was
aware
also
that
on
the
other
hand
he
was
in
like
manner
the
mark
of
rust
and
wilder
those
polite
gentlemen
having
threatened
him
with
a
brace
of
slugs
in
his
brain
if
he
dared
to
betray
their
it
is
necessary
that
i
should
be
in
my
answers
murmured
he
is
there
any
one
within
that
place
besides
yourself
said
the
major
making
a
movement
thither
no
sir
nobody
at
all
answered
coates
hastily
fancying
at
the
same
time
that
he
heard
the
click
of
the
pistol
that
was
to
be
his
how
came
you
here
sir
demanded
ranulph
do
you
mean
in
this
identical
spot
replied
coates
evasively
you
can
have
no
difficulty
in
answering
that
question
said
the
major
sternly
pardon
me
sir
i
find
considerable
difficulty
in
answering
any
question
situated
as
i
am
have
you
seen
miss
mowbray
asked
ranulph
eagerly
or
my
mother
said
the
major
in
the
same
breath
neither
replied
coates
rather
relieved
by
these
questions
i
suspect
you
are
deceiving
us
sir
said
the
major
your
manner
is
confused
i
am
convinced
you
know
more
of
this
matter
than
you
choose
to
explain
and
if
you
do
not
satisfy
me
at
once
fully
and
explicitly
i
vow
to
heaven
and
the
major
sword
described
a
glittering
circle
round
his
head
are
you
privy
to
their
concealment
asked
ranulph
have
you
seen
aught
of
them
or
of
luke
bradley
speak
or
this
moment
is
your
last
said
the
major
if
it
my
last
i
speak
returned
coates
i
can
make
neither
head
nor
tail
of
your
questions
gentlemen
and
you
positively
assure
me
you
have
not
seen
mowbray
and
her
daughter
said
ranulph
turpin
here
winked
at
coates
the
attorney
understood
him
i
do
positively
assert
that
faltered
he
how
you
seen
them
shouted
ranulph
where
are
they
in
safety
speak
added
the
major
another
expressive
gesture
from
the
highwayman
communicated
to
the
attorney
the
nature
of
his
reply
without
sir
without
yonder
he
replied
i
will
show
you
myself
follow
gentlemen
follow
and
away
scampered
coates
without
once
venturing
to
look
behind
him
in
an
instant
the
ruined
hall
was
deserted
and
turpin
alone
left
behind
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
his
presence
had
been
forgotten
in
an
instant
afterwards
the
was
again
occupied
by
a
company
equally
numerous
rust
and
wilder
issued
from
their
followed
by
a
throng
of
the
gipsy
crew
where
is
sir
luke
rookwood
asked
turpin
he
remains
below
was
the
answer
returned
and
peter
bradley
stays
there
likewise
no
matter
now
make
ready
pals
give
one
shout
hurrah
hurrah
replied
the
crowd
at
the
top
of
their
voices
ranulph
rookwood
and
his
companions
heard
this
shout
coates
had
already
explained
the
stratagem
practised
upon
them
by
the
wily
highwayman
as
well
as
the
perilous
situation
in
which
he
himself
had
been
placed
and
they
were
in
the
act
of
returning
to
make
good
his
capture
when
the
loud
shouts
of
the
crew
arrested
them
from
the
clamor
it
was
evident
that
considerable
reinforcement
must
have
arrived
from
some
quarter
and
although
burning
to
be
avenged
upon
the
audacious
highwayman
the
major
felt
it
would
be
a
task
of
difficulty
and
that
extreme
caution
could
alone
ensure
success
with
difficulty
restraining
the
impatience
of
ranulph
who
could
scarcely
brook
these
few
minutes
of
needful
delay
major
mowbray
gave
particular
instructions
to
each
of
the
men
in
detail
and
caused
several
of
them
to
dismount
by
this
arrangement
coates
found
himself
accommodated
with
a
steed
and
a
pair
of
pistols
with
which
latter
he
vowed
to
wreak
his
vengeance
upon
some
of
his
recent
tormentors
after
a
short
space
of
time
occupied
in
this
manner
the
troop
slowly
advanced
towards
the
postern
in
much
better
order
than
upon
the
previous
occasion
but
the
stoutest
of
them
quailed
as
they
caught
sight
of
the
numerous
drawn
out
in
battle
array
within
the
abbey
walls
each
party
scanned
the
other
movements
in
silence
and
wonder
anxiously
awaiting
yet
in
a
measure
dreading
their
leader
signal
to
begin
that
signal
was
not
long
delayed
a
shot
from
the
ranks
of
rookwood
did
instant
and
bitter
execution
rob
rust
was
stretched
lifeless
upon
the
ground
nothing
more
was
needed
the
action
now
became
general
fire
arms
were
discharged
on
both
sides
without
much
damage
to
either
party
but
a
rush
being
made
by
a
detachment
of
horse
headed
by
major
mowbray
the
conflict
soon
became
more
serious
the
gipsies
after
the
first
fire
threw
aside
their
pistols
and
fought
with
long
knives
with
which
they
inflicted
desperate
gashes
both
on
men
and
horses
major
mowbray
was
slightly
wounded
in
the
thigh
and
his
steed
receiving
the
blow
intended
for
himself
stumbled
and
threw
his
rider
luckily
for
the
major
ranulph
rookwood
was
at
hand
and
with
the
of
a
pistol
felled
the
ruffian
to
the
earth
just
as
he
was
upon
the
point
of
repeating
the
thrust
turpin
meanwhile
had
taken
comparatively
a
small
share
in
the
conflict
he
seemed
to
content
himself
with
acting
upon
the
defensive
and
except
in
the
case
of
titus
tyrconnel
whom
espying
amidst
the
crowd
he
had
considerably
alarmed
by
sending
a
bullet
through
his
wig
he
did
not
fire
a
single
shot
he
also
succeeded
in
unhorsing
coates
by
hurling
with
great
dexterity
the
empty
pistol
at
his
head
though
apparently
unconcerned
in
the
skirmish
he
did
not
flinch
from
it
but
kept
his
ground
unyieldingly
a
charmed
life
he
seemed
to
bear
for
amid
the
shower
of
bullets
many
of
which
were
especially
aimed
at
himself
he
came
off
unhurt
he
that
born
to
be
hanged
will
never
be
drowned
that
certain
said
titus
it
no
use
trying
to
bring
him
down
but
by
jasus
spoiled
my
best
hat
and
wig
anyhow
there
a
hole
in
my
beaver
as
big
as
a
crown
piece
your
own
crown
safe
and
that
some
satisfaction
said
coates
whereas
mine
has
a
bump
on
it
as
large
as
a
swan
egg
ah
if
we
could
only
get
behind
him
the
strife
continued
to
rage
without
intermission
and
though
there
were
now
several
ghastly
evidences
of
its
fury
in
the
shape
of
wounded
men
and
slaughtered
or
disabled
horses
whose
gaping
wounds
flooded
the
turf
with
gore
it
was
still
difficult
to
see
upon
which
side
victory
would
eventually
declare
herself
the
gipsies
though
by
far
the
greater
sufferers
of
the
two
firmly
maintained
their
ground
drenched
in
the
blood
of
the
horses
they
had
wounded
and
brandishing
their
long
knives
they
presented
a
formidable
and
terrific
appearance
the
effect
of
which
was
not
at
all
diminished
by
their
wild
yells
and
savage
gesticulations
on
the
other
hand
headed
by
major
mowbray
and
ranulph
the
troop
of
yeomen
pressed
on
undauntedly
and
where
the
sturdy
farmers
could
get
a
firm
gripe
of
their
lithe
antagonists
or
deliver
a
blow
with
their
fists
they
seldom
failed
to
make
good
the
advantages
which
superior
weight
and
strength
gave
them
it
will
thus
be
seen
that
as
yet
they
were
pretty
well
matched
numbers
were
in
favor
of
the
gipsies
but
courage
was
equally
distributed
and
perhaps
what
is
emphatically
called
bottom
was
in
favor
of
the
rustics
be
this
as
it
may
from
what
had
already
occurred
there
was
every
prospect
of
a
very
serious
termination
to
the
fray
from
time
to
time
turpin
glanced
to
the
entrance
of
the
cell
in
the
expectation
of
seeing
sir
luke
rookwood
make
his
appearance
and
as
he
was
constantly
disappointed
in
his
expectation
he
could
not
conceal
his
chagrin
at
length
he
resolved
to
despatch
a
messenger
to
him
and
one
of
the
crew
accordingly
departed
upon
this
errand
he
returned
presently
with
a
look
of
blank
dismay
in
our
hasty
narrative
of
the
fight
we
have
not
paused
to
particularize
neither
have
we
enumerated
the
list
of
the
combatants
amongst
them
however
were
jerry
juniper
the
knight
of
malta
and
zoroaster
excalibur
as
may
be
conceived
had
not
been
idle
but
that
trenchant
blade
had
been
shivered
by
ranulph
rookwood
in
the
early
stage
of
the
business
and
the
knight
left
weaponless
zoroaster
who
was
not
merely
a
worshipper
of
fire
but
a
thorough
had
engaged
to
some
purpose
in
a
pugilistic
encounter
with
the
rustics
and
having
fought
several
rounds
now
bore
his
blushing
honors
thick
upon
him
jerry
like
turpin
had
remained
tolerably
quiescent
the
proper
moment
he
said
had
not
arrived
a
fatality
seemed
to
attend
turpin
immediate
companions
rust
was
the
first
who
fell
wilder
also
was
now
among
the
slain
things
were
precisely
in
this
condition
when
the
messenger
returned
a
marked
change
was
instantly
perceptible
in
turpin
manner
he
no
longer
looked
on
with
indifference
he
seemed
angry
and
distrustful
he
gnawed
his
lip
ever
a
sign
with
him
of
vexation
addressing
a
few
words
to
those
about
him
he
then
spoke
more
loudly
to
the
rest
of
the
crew
being
in
the
jargon
of
the
tawny
tribe
his
words
were
not
intelligible
to
the
opposite
party
but
their
import
was
soon
made
known
by
the
almost
instant
and
total
relinquishment
of
the
field
by
the
gipsies
they
took
to
their
heels
at
once
to
a
man
leaving
only
a
few
desperately
wounded
behind
them
and
flying
along
the
intricate
ruins
of
the
priory
baffled
all
pursuit
wherever
it
was
attempted
jerry
juniper
was
the
last
in
the
retreat
but
upon
receiving
a
hint
from
dick
he
vaulted
like
a
roe
over
the
heads
of
his
adversaries
and
made
good
his
escape
turpin
alone
remained
he
stood
like
a
lion
at
bay
quietly
regarding
the
huntsmen
hurtling
around
him
ranulph
rookwood
rode
up
and
bade
him
surrender
detain
me
not
cried
he
in
a
voice
of
thunder
if
you
would
save
her
who
is
dear
to
you
descend
into
that
vault
off
i
say
and
turpin
shook
away
with
ease
the
grasp
that
ranulph
had
laid
upon
him
villain
you
do
not
escape
me
this
time
said
major
mowbray
interposing
himself
between
turpin
and
the
outlet
major
mowbray
i
would
not
have
your
blood
upon
my
head
said
dick
let
me
pass
and
he
levelled
a
pistol
fire
if
you
dare
said
the
major
raising
his
sword
you
pass
not
i
will
die
rather
than
allow
you
to
escape
barricade
the
door
strike
him
down
if
he
attempts
to
pass
richard
turpin
i
arrest
you
in
the
name
you
hear
my
lads
in
his
majesty
name
i
command
you
to
assist
me
in
this
highwayman
capture
two
hundred
pounds
for
his
head
two
hundred
devils
exclaimed
dick
with
a
laugh
of
disdain
go
seek
your
mother
and
sister
within
yon
vault
major
mowbray
you
will
find
employment
enough
there
saying
which
he
suddenly
forced
bess
to
back
a
few
yards
then
striking
his
heels
sharply
into
her
sides
ere
his
purpose
could
be
divined
by
the
spectators
charged
and
cleared
the
lower
part
of
the
mouldering
priory
walls
this
feat
was
apparently
accomplished
with
no
great
effort
by
his
admirable
and
unequalled
mare
by
the
powers
cried
titus
and
he
given
us
the
slip
after
all
and
just
when
we
thought
to
make
sure
of
him
too
why
coates
that
wall
must
be
higher
than
a
gate
or
any
stone
wall
in
my
own
country
it
just
the
most
extraordinary
lepp
i
ever
set
eyes
on
the
devil
in
the
fellow
certainly
or
in
his
mare
returned
coates
but
if
he
escapes
me
i
forgive
him
i
know
whither
he
bound
off
to
london
with
my
bill
of
exchange
i
be
up
with
him
i
track
him
like
a
bloodhound
slowly
and
surely
as
my
father
the
used
to
follow
up
a
scent
recollect
the
hare
and
the
tortoise
the
race
is
not
always
to
the
swift
what
say
you
is
a
match
for
five
hundred
pounds
nay
for
five
thousand
for
there
is
a
certain
marriage
certificate
in
the
way
a
glorious
golden
venture
you
shall
go
halves
if
we
win
we
have
him
dead
or
alive
what
say
you
for
london
tyrconnel
shall
we
start
at
once
with
all
my
sowl
replied
titus
i
with
you
and
away
this
scoured
ranulph
meantime
plunged
into
the
vault
the
floor
was
slippery
and
he
had
nigh
stumbled
loud
and
deep
lamentations
and
a
wailing
sound
like
that
of
a
lament
for
the
dead
resounded
in
his
ears
a
light
at
the
further
extremity
of
the
vault
attracted
his
attention
he
was
filled
with
terrible
forebodings
but
the
worst
reality
was
not
so
terrible
as
suspense
he
rushed
towards
the
light
he
passed
the
massive
pillars
and
there
by
the
ruddy
torch
flame
discovered
two
female
figures
one
was
an
old
woman
fantastically
attired
wringing
her
hands
and
moaning
or
gibbering
wild
strains
in
broken
discordant
yet
pathetic
tones
the
other
was
mowbray
both
were
images
of
despair
before
them
lay
some
motionless
object
he
noticed
not
that
old
woman
he
scarcely
saw
mowbray
he
beheld
only
that
object
of
horror
it
was
the
lifeless
body
of
a
female
the
light
fell
imperfectly
upon
the
face
he
could
not
discern
the
features
but
the
veil
in
which
it
was
swathed
that
veil
was
eleanor
he
asked
no
more
with
a
wild
cry
he
rushed
forward
eleanor
my
beloved
shrieked
he
mowbray
started
at
his
voice
but
appeared
stunned
and
helpless
she
is
dead
said
ranulph
stooping
towards
the
body
dead
dead
ay
echoed
the
old
woman
in
accents
of
equal
anguish
dead
dead
but
this
is
eleanor
exclaimed
he
as
he
viewed
the
features
more
closely
this
face
though
beautiful
is
not
hers
this
dishevelled
hair
is
black
the
long
lashes
that
shade
her
cheek
are
of
the
same
hue
she
is
scarce
dead
the
hand
i
clasp
is
yet
warm
the
fingers
are
pliant
yet
she
is
dead
said
the
old
woman
in
a
broken
voice
she
is
slain
who
hath
slain
her
asked
ranulph
i
i
her
mother
slew
her
you
exclaimed
ranulph
and
where
is
eleanor
asked
he
was
she
not
here
better
she
were
here
now
even
though
she
were
as
that
poor
maid
groaned
mowbray
than
where
she
is
where
is
she
then
asked
ranulph
with
frantic
eagerness
fled
whither
i
know
not
with
whom
with
sir
luke
rookwood
with
alan
rookwood
they
have
borne
her
hence
ranulph
you
are
too
late
gone
cried
ranulph
fiercely
springing
to
his
feet
how
escaped
they
there
appears
to
be
but
one
entrance
to
this
vault
i
will
search
each
nook
and
cranny
is
vain
replied
mowbray
there
is
another
outlet
through
yon
cell
by
that
passage
they
escaped
too
true
too
true
shouted
ranulph
who
flew
to
examine
the
cell
and
wherefore
followed
you
not
the
stone
rolled
to
its
mouth
and
resisted
my
efforts
i
could
not
follow
torture
and
death
she
is
lost
to
me
for
ever
cried
ranulph
bitterly
no
exclaimed
barbara
clutching
his
arm
place
your
trust
in
me
and
i
will
find
her
for

ranulph

the
present
straggling
suburb
at
the
of
the
metropolis
known
as
kilburn
had
scarcely
been
called
into
existence
a
century
ago
and
an
ancient
hostel
with
a
few
detached
farmhouses
were
the
sole
habitations
to
be
found
in
the
present
populous
vicinage
the
place
of
refreshment
for
the
ruralizing
cockney
of
was
a
tenement
of
the
good
old
stamp
with
great
bay
windows
and
a
balcony
in
front
bearing
as
its
ensign
the
jovial
visage
of
the
lusty
knight
jack
falstaff
shaded
by
a
spreading
elm
a
circular
bench
embraced
the
aged
trunk
of
the
tree
sufficiently
tempting
no
doubt
to
incline
the
wanderer
on
those
dusty
ways
to
rest
and
be
thankful
and
to
cry
to
a
frothing
tankard
of
the
best
ale
to
be
obtained
within
the
chimes
of
bow
bells
upon
a
table
green
as
the
privet
and
holly
that
formed
the
walls
of
the
bower
in
which
it
was
placed
stood
a
great
china
bowl
one
of
those
leviathan
memorials
of
bygone
wassailry
which
we
may
sometimes
espy
reversed
in
token
of
its
desuetude
perched
on
the
top
of
an
old
japanned
closet
but
seldom
if
ever
encountered
in
its
proper
position
at
the
genial
board
all
the
appliances
of
festivity
were
at
hand
pipes
and
rummers
strewed
the
board
perfume
subtle
yet
mellow
as
of
pine
and
lime
exhaled
from
out
the
bowl
and
mingling
with
the
scent
of
a
neighboring
bed
of
mignonette
and
the
subdued
odor
of
the
indian
weed
formed
altogether
as
delectable
an
atmosphere
of
sweets
as
one
could
wish
to
inhale
on
a
melting
august
afternoon
so
at
least
thought
the
inmates
of
the
arbor
nor
did
they
by
any
means
confine
themselves
to
the
gratification
of
a
single
sense
the
ambrosial
contents
of
the
china
bowl
proved
as
delicious
to
the
taste
as
its
bouquet
was
grateful
to
the
smell
while
the
eyesight
was
soothed
by
reposing
on
the
smooth
sward
of
a
spread
out
immediately
before
it
or
in
dwelling
upon
gently
undulating
meads
terminating
at
about
a
mile
distance
in
the
woody
heights
of
hampstead
at
the
left
of
the
table
was
seated
or
rather
lounged
a
slender
young
man
with
dark
languid
eyes
sallow
complexion
and
features
wearing
that
peculiarly
pensive
expression
often
communicated
by
dissipation
an
expression
which
we
regret
to
say
is
sometimes
found
more
pleasing
than
it
ought
to
be
in
the
eyes
of
the
gentle
sex
habited
in
a
light
summer
fashioned
according
to
the
taste
of
the
time
of
plain
and
unpretending
material
and
rather
under
than
overdressed
he
had
perhaps
on
that
very
account
perfectly
the
air
of
a
gentleman
there
was
altogether
an
absence
of
pretension
about
him
which
combined
with
great
apparent
contrasted
very
forcibly
with
the
vulgar
assurance
of
his
showy
companions
the
figure
of
the
youth
was
slight
even
to
fragility
giving
little
outward
manifestation
of
the
vigor
of
frame
he
in
reality
possessed
this
spark
was
a
no
less
distinguished
personage
than
tom
king
a
noted
of
his
time
who
obtained
from
his
appearance
and
address
the
of
the
gentleman
highwayman
tom
was
indeed
a
pleasant
fellow
in
his
day
his
career
was
brief
but
brilliant
your
meteors
are
ever
momentary
he
was
a
younger
son
of
a
good
family
had
good
blood
in
his
veins
though
not
a
groat
in
his
pockets
according
to
the
old
song
when
he
arrived
at
man
estate
it
was
the
he
had
and
all
the
estate
he
was
ever
likely
to
have
nevertheless
if
he
had
no
income
he
contrived
as
he
said
to
live
as
if
he
had
the
mines
of
peru
at
his
control
a
miracle
not
solely
confined
to
himself
for
a
moneyless
man
he
had
rather
expensive
habits
he
kept
his
three
nags
and
if
fame
does
not
belie
him
a
like
number
of
mistresses
nay
if
we
are
to
place
any
faith
in
certain
scandalous
chronicles
to
which
we
have
had
access
he
was
for
some
time
the
favored
lover
of
a
celebrated
actress
who
for
the
time
supplied
him
with
the
means
of
keeping
up
his
showy
establishment
but
things
could
not
long
hold
thus
tom
was
a
model
of
infidelity
and
that
was
the
only
failing
his
mistress
could
not
overlook
she
dismissed
him
at
a
moment
notice
unluckily
too
he
had
other
propensities
which
contributed
to
involve
him
he
had
a
taste
for
the
turf
a
taste
for
play
was
well
known
in
the
hundreds
of
drury
and
cut
no
mean
figure
at
howell
and
the
faro
tables
he
was
the
glory
of
the
smyrna
and
other
chocolate
houses
of
the
day
and
it
was
at
this
time
he
fell
into
the
hands
of
certain
dexterous
sharpers
by
whom
he
was
at
first
plucked
and
subsequently
patronized
under
their
tuition
he
improved
wonderfully
he
turned
his
wit
and
talent
to
some
account
he
began
to
open
his
eyes
his
nine
days
blindness
was
over
the
dog
saw
but
in
spite
of
his
quickness
he
was
at
length
discovered
and
ejected
from
howell
in
a
manner
that
left
him
no
alternative
he
must
either
have
called
out
his
adversary
or
have
gone
out
himself
he
preferred
the
latter
and
took
to
the
road
and
in
his
new
line
he
was
eminently
successful
fortunately
he
had
no
scruples
to
get
over
tom
had
what
sir
walter
scott
happily
denominates
an
indistinct
notion
of
and
and
became
confirmed
in
the
opinion
that
everything
he
could
lay
hands
upon
constituted
lawful
spoil
and
then
even
those
he
robbed
admitted
that
he
was
the
most
gentlemanlike
highwayman
they
had
ever
the
fortune
to
meet
with
and
trusted
they
might
always
be
so
lucky
so
popular
did
he
become
upon
the
road
that
it
was
accounted
a
distinction
to
be
stopped
by
him
he
made
a
point
of
robbing
none
but
gentlemen
and
tom
shade
would
quarrel
with
us
were
we
to
omit
them
ladies
his
acquaintance
with
turpin
was
singular
and
originated
in
a
rencontre
struck
with
his
appearance
dick
presented
a
pistol
and
bade
king
deliver
the
latter
burst
into
a
laugh
and
an
explanation
immediately
ensued
thenceforward
they
became
sworn
brothers
the
pylades
and
orestes
of
the
road
and
though
seldom
seen
together
in
public
had
many
a
merry
moonlight
ride
in
company
tom
still
maintained
three
mistresses
his
valet
his
groom
tiger
we
should
have
called
him
and
many
a
change
of
clothes
besides
says
his
biographer
with
which
he
appeared
more
like
a
lord
than
a
highwayman
and
what
more
we
should
like
to
know
would
a
lord
wish
to
have
few
younger
sons
we
believe
can
boast
so
much
and
it
is
chiefly
on
their
account
with
some
remote
view
to
the
benefit
of
the
unemployed
youth
of
all
professions
that
we
have
enlarged
so
much
upon
tom
history
the
road
we
must
beg
to
repeat
is
still
open
the
chances
are
greater
than
they
ever
were
we
fully
believe
it
is
only
road
to
preferment
and
we
are
sadly
in
want
of
highwaymen
fancy
tom
lounging
at
carelessly
tapping
his
boots
on
the
steps
there
he
stands
is
he
not
a
devilish
gentlemanlike
sort
of
fellow
you
could
never
have
taken
him
for
a
highwayman
but
for
our
information
a
waiter
appears
supper
is
ordered
at
twelve
a
broiled
chicken
and
a
bottle
of
burgundy
his
groom
brings
his
nags
to
the
door
he
mounts
it
is
his
custom
to
ride
out
on
an
evening
he
is
less
liable
to
interruption
at
marylebone
fields
now
the
park
his
groom
leaves
him
he
has
a
mistress
in
the
neighborhood
he
is
absent
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
returns
gay
or
dispirited
as
his
luck
may
have
turned
out
at
twelve
he
is
at
supper
and
has
the
night
before
him
how
very
easy
all
this
seems
can
it
be
possible
we
have
no
tom
kings
to
return
to
tom
as
he
was
in
the
arbor
judging
from
his
manner
he
appeared
to
be
almost
insensible
to
the
presence
of
his
companions
and
to
be
scarcely
a
partaker
in
their
revelry
his
back
was
towards
his
immediate
neighbor
his
glass
sparkled
untouched
at
his
elbow
and
one
hand
beautifully
white
and
small

mark
of
his
birth
and
breeding

rested
upon
the
edge
of

thin
delicate
digits
palpably
demonstrative
of
his
faculty
of
adaptation
james
hardy
vaux
were
employed
with
a
silver
toothpick
in
other
respects
he
seemed
to
be
lost
in
reverie

in
all
probability
meditating
new
exploits

gipsies
but
a
much
more
personage
jerry
was
no
longer
a
gentleman
of
three
the
difficulty
would
now
have
been
to
say
what
he
was
without
snakelike
he
had
cast
his
slough
and
rejoiced
in
new
and
brilliant
investiture
his
were
speaking
garments
speaking
pockets
too
his
linen
was
of
the
finest
his
hose
of
the
smartest
gay
rings
glittered
on
his
fingers
a
crystal
underwent
graceful
manipulation
a
handsome
gold
repeater
was
sometimes
drawn
from
its
location
with
a
monstrous
bunch
of
onions
seals
depending
from
its
massive
chain
lace
adorned
his
wrists
and
shoes
of
which
they
had
been
long
unconscious
with
buckles
nearly
as
large
as
themselves
confined
his
feet
a
peruke
and
sword
completed
the
gear
of
the
transmogrified
jerry
or
as
he
now
chose
to
be
designated
count
albert
conyers
the
fact
was
that
jerry
after
the
apprehensive
that
the
country
would
be
too
hot
for
him
had
in
company
with
zoroaster
quitted
the
ranks
of
the
canting
crew
and
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
town
a
lucky
on
the
road
set
them
up
and
having
some
acquaintance
with
tom
king
the
party
on
their
arrival
sought
him
out
at
his
customary
haunt
and
enlisted
under
his
banners
tom
received
them
with
open
arms
gave
them
unlimited
use
of
his
wardrobe
and
only
required
a
little
trifling
assistance
in
return
he
had
a
grand
scheme
in
the
execution
of
which
they
could
mainly
assist
him
jerry
was
a
by
nature
and
could
a
flat
as
well
as
the
best
of
them
zoroaster
was
just
the
man
to
a
fight
or
in
the
language
of
the
to
a
no
two
could
serve
tom
purposes
better
he
welcomed
them
with
fraternal
affection
we
will
now
proceed
to
reconnoitre
jerry
opposite
neighbor
who
was
however
no
other
than
that
upright
man
the
magus
zoroaster
that
great
name
changed
as
was
juniper
the
magus
was
yet
more
whimsically
metamorphosed
some
traces
of
jerry
still
remained
but
not
a
vestige
was
left
of
the
original
dimber
damber
his
tawny
mother
had
not
known
her
son
this
alteration
however
was
not
owing
to
change
of
dress
it
was
the
result
of
the
punishment
he
had
received
at
the
at
the
priory
not
a
feature
was
in
its
place
his
swollen
lip
trespassed
upon
the
precincts
of
his
nose
his
nose
trod
hard
upon
his
cheek
while
his
cheek
again
not
to
be
behind
the
rest
rose
up
like
an
under
his
single
eye
single
we
say
for
alas
there
was
no
speculation
in
the
other
his
dexter
daylight
was
utterly
darkened
and
indeed
the
orb
that
remained
was
as
sanguinary
a
luminary
as
ever
struggled
through
a
london
fog
at
noonday
to
borrow
a
couplet
or
so
from
the
laureate
of
the
one
of
his
peepers
was
put
on
the
bankruptcy
list
with
his
shop
windows
shut
while
the
other
made
nearly
as
a
show
all
rimmed
round
with
black
like
the
in
woe
one
black
patch
decorated
his
cheek
another
adorned
his
chin
a
grinder
having
been
dislodged
his
pipe
took
possession
of
the
aperture
his
toggery
was
that
of
a
member
of
the
what
we
now
call
a
belcher
bound
his
throat
a
spotted
bandaged
his
and
shaded
his
right
peeper
while
a
white
beaver
crowned
the
occiput
of
the
magus
and
though
at
first
sight
there
would
appear
to
be
some
incongruity
in
the
association
of
such
a
battered
character
as
the
upright
man
with
his
smart
companions
the
reader
wonder
will
rapidly
diminish
when
he
reflects
that
any
distinguished
man
can
ever
find
a
ready
passport
to
the
most
exclusive
society
viewed
in
this
light
zoroaster
familiarity
with
his
acquaintance
occasioned
no
surprise
to
old
simon
carr
the
landlord
of
the
falstaff
who
was
a
man
of
discernment
in
his
way
and
knew
a
thing
or
two
despite
such
striking
evidences
to
the
contrary
the
magus
was
perfectly
at
his
ease
and
sacrificing
as
usual
to
the
god
of
flame
his
mithra
or
pipe
the
symbol
of
his
faith
was
zealously
placed
between
his
lips
and
never
did
his
chaldean
bactrian
persian
pamphylian
proconnesian
or
babylonian
namesake
whichever
of
the
six
was
the
true
zoroaster
bayle
respire
more
fervently
at
the
altar
of
fire
than
our
magus
at
the
end
of
his
enkindled
tube
in
his
creed
we
believe
zoroaster
was
a
dualist
and
believed
in
the
and
mystical
relation
of
the
principles
of
good
and
ill
his
pipe
being
his
yezdan
or
benign
influence
his
empty
pouch
his
ahreman
or
the
devil
we
shall
not
pause
to
examine
his
tenets
we
meddle
with
no
man
religious
opinions
and
shall
leave
the
magus
to
the
enjoyment
of
his
own
sentiments
be
they
what
they
may
one
guest
alone
remains
and
him
we
shall
briefly
dismiss
the
reader
we
imagine
will
scarcely
need
to
be
told
who
was
the
owner
of
those
keen
gray
eyes
those
exuberant
red
whiskers
that
airy
azure
frock
it
was
our
brave
of
the
roads
skilful
surveyor
of
highways
and
hedges
in
a
word
dick
turpin
dick
had
been
called
upon
to
act
as
president
of
the
board
and
an
excellent
president
he
made
sedulously
devoting
himself
to
the
due
administration
of
the
not
a
rummer
was
allowed
to
stand
empty
for
an
instant
toast
sentiment
and
anacreontic
song
succeeded
each
other
at
speedy
intervals
but
there
was
no
speechifying
no
politics
he
left
church
and
state
to
take
care
of
themselves
whatever
his
politics
might
be
dick
never
allowed
them
to
interfere
with
his
pleasures
his
maxim
was
to
make
the
most
of
the
passing
moment
the
vivimus
was
never
out
of
his
mind
a
precautionary
measure
which
we
recommend
to
the
adoption
of
all
gentlemen
of
the
like
or
any
other
precarious
profession
notwithstanding
all
dick
efforts
to
promote
conviviality
seconded
by
the
excellence
of
the
beverage
itself
conversation
somehow
or
other
began
to
flag
from
being
general
it
became
particular
tom
king
who
was
no
especially
at
that
time
of
day
fell
into
a
deep
reverie
your
gamesters
often
do
so
while
the
magus
who
had
smoked
himself
drowsy
was
composing
himself
to
a
doze
turpin
seized
this
opportunity
of
addressing
a
few
words
on
matters
of
business
to
jerry
juniper
or
as
he
now
chose
to
be
called
count
conyers
my
dear
count
said
dick
in
a
low
and
confidential
tone
you
are
aware
that
my
errand
to
town
is
accomplished
i
have
lawyer
coates
pocketed
the
here
is
continued
he
parenthetically
slapping
his
pockets
and
done
trick
in
prime
twig
for
tom
king
with
a
cool
thousand
in
hand
i
might
if
i
chose
rest
awhile
on
my
oars
but
a
quiet
life
do
suit
me
i
must
be
moving
so
i
shall
start
to
yorkshire
indeed
said
the
count
in
a
languid
tone
so
soon
i
have
nothing
to
detain
me
replied
dick
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
want
to
see
how
matters
stand
with
sir
luke
rookwood
i
should
be
sorry
if
he
went
to
the
wall
for
want
of
any
assistance
i
can
render
him
true
returned
the
count
one
would
regret
such
an
occurrence
certainly
but
i
fear
your
assistance
may
arrive
a
little
too
late
he
is
pretty
well
done
up
i
should
imagine
by
this
time
that
remains
to
be
seen
said
turpin
his
case
is
a
bad
one
to
be
sure
but
i
trust
not
utterly
hopeless
with
all
his
impetuosity
and
pride
i
like
the
fellow
and
will
help
him
if
i
can
it
will
be
a
difficult
game
to
set
him
on
his
legs
but
i
think
it
may
be
done
that
underground
marriage
was
sheer
madness
and
turned
out
as
ill
as
such
a
scheme
might
have
been
expected
to
do
poor
sybil
if
i
could
pipe
an
eye
for
anything
it
should
be
for
her
i
ca
get
her
out
of
my
head
give
me
a
pinch
of
snuff
such
thoughts
unman
one
as
to
the
priest
that
a
totally
different
affair
if
he
strangled
his
daughter
old
alan
did
right
to
take
the
law
into
his
own
hands
and
throttle
him
in
return
i
have
done
the
same
thing
myself
and
being
a
proscribed
jesuit
returned
as
i
understand
without
the
king
license
for
so
doing
why
father
checkley
murder
if
it
must
be
so
called
i
abide
hard
terms
wo
lie
very
heavy
at
alan
door
that
however
has
nothing
to
do
with
sir
luke
he
was
neither
accessory
nor
principal
still
he
will
be
in
danger
at
least
from
lady
rookwood
the
whole
county
of
york
i
make
no
doubt
is
up
in
arms
by
this
time
then
why
go
thither
asked
the
count
somewhat
ironically
for
my
part
i
a
strange
fancy
for
keeping
out
of
harm
way
as
long
as
possible
every
man
to
his
taste
returned
turpin
i
love
to
confront
danger
run
away
pshaw
always
meet
your
foe
true
replied
the
count
but
you
go
the
whole
distance
what
prudent
man
would
beard
the
lion
in
his
den
i
never
was
a
prudent
man
rejoined
dick
smiling
i
have
no
superfluous
caution
about
me
come
what
will
i
shall
try
to
find
out
this
luke
rookwood
and
offer
him
my
purse
such
as
it
is
and
it
is
now
better
lined
than
usual
a
hand
free
to
act
as
he
lists
and
a
head
which
imprudent
though
it
be
can
often
think
better
for
others
than
for
its
own
master
vastly
fine
exclaimed
the
count
with
an
sneer
i
hope
you
do
forget
that
the
marriage
certificate
which
you
hold
is
perfectly
valueless
now
the
estates
you
are
aware
are
no
longer
sir
luke
i
see
what
you
are
driving
at
count
returned
dick
coldly
but
he
will
need
it
to
establish
his
claim
to
the
title
and
he
shall
have
it
while
he
was
sir
luke
with
ten
thousand
a
year
i
drove
a
hard
bargain
and
would
have
stood
out
for
the
last
stiver
now
that
he
is
one
of
a
mere
knight
of
the
road
he
shall
have
it
and
welcome
perhaps
lady
rookwood
or
mowbray
might
be
inclined
to
treat
maliciously
insinuated
the
count
the
title
may
be
worth
something
to
ranulph
it
is
worth
more
to
luke
and
if
it
were
he
gets
it
are
you
satisfied
perfectly
replied
the
count
with
affected
and
i
will
now
let
you
into
a
secret
respecting
miss
mowbray
from
which
you
may
gather
something
for
your
guidance
in
this
matter
and
if
the
word
of
a
woman
is
at
all
to
be
trusted
though
individually
i
can
not
say
i
have
much
faith
in
it
sir
luke
planetary
hour
is
not
yet
completely
overcast
that
exactly
what
i
wish
to
know
my
dear
fellow
said
turpin
eagerly
you
have
already
told
me
you
were
witness
to
a
singular
interview
between
miss
mowbray
and
sir
luke
after
my
departure
from
the
priory
if
i
mistook
you
not
the
whole
business
will
hinge
upon
that
what
occurred
let
me
have
every
particular
the
whole
history
and
mystery
you
shall
have
it
with
pleasure
said
the
count
and
i
hope
it
may
tend
to
your
benefit
after
i
had
quitted
the
scene
of
action
at
the
priory
and
at
your
desire
left
the
rookwood
party
masters
of
the
field
i
fled
with
the
rest
of
the
crew
towards
the
rocks
there
we
held
a
council
of
war
for
a
short
time
some
were
for
returning
to
the
fight
but
this
was
negatived
entirely
and
in
the
end
it
was
agreed
that
those
who
had
wives
daughters
and
sisters
should
join
them
as
speedily
as
possible
at
their
retreat
in
the
grange
as
i
happened
to
have
none
of
these
attractive
ties
and
had
only
a
troublesome
mistress
who
i
thought
could
take
care
of
herself
i
did
not
care
to
follow
them
but
struck
deeper
into
the
wood
and
made
my
way
guided
by
destiny
i
suppose
towards
the
cave
the
cave
cried
dick
rubbing
his
hands
i
delight
in
a
cave
tom
king
and
i
once
had
a
cave
of
our
own
at
epping
and
i
have
another
one
of
these
fine
days
a
cave
is
as
proper
to
a
as
a
castle
to
a
baron
pray
go
on
the
cave
i
speak
of
continued
the
count
was
seldom
used
except
upon
great
emergencies
by
any
of
the
stop
hole
abbey
crew
it
was
a
sort
of
retiring
den
of
our
old
lioness
barbara
and
like
all
belonging
to
her
respected
by
her
dupes
however
the
cave
is
a
good
cave
for
all
that
is
well
concealed
by
brushwood
and
comfortably
lighted
from
a
crevice
in
the
rock
above
it
lies
near
the
brink
of
the
stream
amongst
the
woods
just
above
the
waterfall
and
is
somewhat
difficult
of
approach
i
know
something
of
the
situation
said
turpin
well
returned
the
count
not
to
lose
time
into
this
den
i
crept
and
expecting
to
find
it
vacant
you
may
imagine
my
surprise
on
discovering
that
it
was
already
occupied
and
that
sir
luke
rookwood
his
granddad
old
alan
miss
mowbray
and
worst
of
all
the
very
person
i
wished
most
to
avoid
my
old
flame
handassah
constituted
the
party
fortunately
they
did
not
perceive
my
entrance
and
i
took
especial
care
not
to
introduce
myself
retreat
however
was
for
the
moment
impracticable
and
i
was
compelled
to
be
a
listener
i
can
not
tell
what
had
passed
between
the
parties
before
my
arrival
but
i
heard
miss
mowbray
implore
sir
luke
to
conduct
her
to
her
mother
he
seemed
half
inclined
to
comply
with
her
entreaties
but
old
alan
shook
his
head
it
was
then
handassah
put
in
a
word
the
minx
was
ever
ready
at
that
not
said
she
she
will
wed
sir
ranulph
deliver
her
to
her
friends
i
beseech
you
sir
luke
and
woo
her
honorably
she
will
accept
you
sir
luke
stared
incredulously
and
grim
old
alan
smiled
has
sworn
to
be
yours
continued
handassah
it
by
every
hope
of
heaven
and
the
oath
has
been
sealed
by
blood
by
sybil
blood
she
speak
the
truth
asked
sir
luke
trembling
with
agitation
miss
mowbray
answered
not
will
not
deny
it
lady
said
handassah
heard
that
oath
proposed
i
saw
it
registered
you
can
not
deny
it
do
not
replied
miss
mowbray
with
much
anguish
of
manner
he
claim
me
i
am
his
he
will
claim
you
said
alan
rookwood
triumphantly
has
your
oath
no
matter
how
extorted
you
must
fulfil
your
vow
am
prepared
to
do
so
said
eleanor
if
you
would
not
utterly
destroy
me
let
this
maid
conduct
me
to
my
mother
to
my
friends
ranulph
asked
sir
luke
no
returned
miss
mowbray
in
accents
of
deepest
despair
my
mother
i
wish
not
to
behold
him
again
it
so
cried
sir
luke
remember
in
love
or
hate
you
are
mine
i
shall
claim
the
fulfilment
of
your
oath
farewell
handassah
will
lead
you
to
your
mother
miss
mowbray
bowed
her
head
but
returned
no
answer
while
followed
by
old
alan
sir
luke
departed
from
the
cavern
whither
went
they
demanded
turpin
that
i
know
not
replied
jerry
i
was
about
to
follow
when
i
was
prevented
by
the
abrupt
entrance
of
another
party
scarcely
i
think
could
the
two
rookwoods
have
made
good
their
retreat
when
shouts
were
heard
without
and
young
ranulph
and
major
mowbray
forced
their
way
sword
in
hand
into
the
cave
here
was
a
situation
for
i
mean
to
the
young
lady
i
make
no
doubt
it
was
pleasant
enough
but
my
neck
was
in
jeopardy
however
you
know
i
am
not
deficient
in
strength
and
upon
the
present
occasion
i
made
the
best
use
of
the
agility
with
which
nature
has
endowed
me
amidst
the
joyous
confusion
the
sobbings
and
embracings
and
congratulations
that
ensued
i
contrived
like
a
wild
cat
to
climb
the
rocky
sides
of
the
cave
and
concealed
myself
behind
a
jutting
fragment
of
stone
it
was
well
i
did
so
for
scarcely
was
i
hidden
when
in
came
old
barbara
followed
by
mowbray
and
a
dozen
others
barbara
ejaculated
dick
was
she
a
prisoner
no
replied
jerry
the
old
is
too
deep
for
that
she
had
betrayed
sir
luke
and
hoped
they
would
seize
him
and
his
granddad
but
the
birds
were
flown
i
glad
she
was
baulked
said
dick
was
any
search
made
after
them
ca
say
replied
jerry
i
could
only
indistinctly
catch
the
sounds
of
their
voices
from
my
lofty
retreat
before
they
left
the
cavern
i
made
out
that
mowbray
resolved
to
go
to
rookwood
and
to
take
her
daughter
thither
a
proceeding
to
which
the
latter
demurred
to
rookwood
said
dick
musingly
will
she
keep
her
oath
i
wonder
that
more
than
i
can
say
said
jerry
sipping
his
punch
is
a
deceitful
sex
is
a
deceitful
sex
indeed
echoed
dick
tossing
off
a
tumbler
for
one
sybil
we
meet
with
twenty
handassahs
eh
count
twenty
say
rather
a
hundred
replied
jerry
is
a
vile
sex
how
gloriously
the
sun
sets
when
i
was
a
boy
my
favorite
thought
was
that
i
should
live
and
die
like
yonder
glorious
orb
it
was
a
boyish
thought
true
captain
peace
base
calumniators
exclaimed
tom
king
aroused
from
his
toothpick
reverie
by
these
aspersions
of
the
best
part
of
creation
peace
i
say
none
shall
dare
abuse
that
dear
devoted
sex
in
the
hearing
of
their
champion
without
pricking
a
lance
with
him
in
their
behalf
what
do
you
either
of
you
who
abuse
woman
in
that
wholesale
style
know
of
her
nothing
less
than
nothing
and
yet
you
venture
upon
your
paltry
experience
to
lift
up
your
voices
and
decry
the
sex
now
i
know
her
and
upon
my
own
experience
avouch
that
as
a
sex
woman
compared
with
man
is
as
an
angel
to
a
devil
as
a
sex
woman
is
faithful
loving
is
that
make
her
otherwise
selfish
exacting
neglectful
men
we
teach
her
indifference
and
then
blame
her
apt
scholarship
we
spoil
our
own
hand
and
then
blame
the
cards
no
abuse
of
women
in
my
hearing
give
me
a
glass
of
grog
dick
sex
three
times
three
and
here
a
song
for
you
into
the
bargain
saying
which
in
a
mellow
plaintive
tone
tom
gave
the
following
pledge
of
the
highwayman
come

up
a

in

each
maiden

bright
eyes
were

at

sorrow
bemoaning
the
fate
of

to
each
lovely

bringeth

whom
with
manner
impassioned
we
tenderly
stop
and
to
whom
like
the
lover
addressing
his
dear
one
in
terms
of
entreaty
we
pop
how
oft
in
such
case
rosy
lips
have
proved
sweeter
than
the
rosiest
book
bright
eyes
saved
a
bright
ring
while
that
kiss
has
brought
off
a

a

as

dick
replenishing
king
rummer
while
he
laughed
heartily
at
his
ditty
i
sha
refuse
your

ah
tom
the
sex
you

your
undoing
do
as
you
please
but
curse
me
if
ever
i
pin
my
life
to
a
petticoat
i
as
soon
think
of
neglecting
the
four
cautions
the
four
cautions
said
king
what
are
they
did
you
never
hear
them
replied
dick
attend
then
and
be
edified
the
four
cautions
pay
attention
to
these
cautions
four
and
through
life
you
will
need
little
more
should
you
dole
out
your
days
to
threescore
beware
of
a
pistol
before
before
before
beware
of
a
pistol
before
and
when
backward
his
ears
are
inclined
and
his
tail
with
his
ham
is
combined
caution
two
you
will
bear
in
your
mind
beware
of
a
prancer
behind
behind
behind
beware
of
a
prancer

thirdly
when
in
the
park
you
may
ride
on
your
best
bit
of
blood
sir
astride
chatting
gay
to
your
old
friend
young
bride
beware
of
a
coach
at
the
side
at
the
side
at

beware
of
a
coach
at
the
side
lastly
whether
in
purple
or
gray
canter
ranter
grave
solemn
or

he
may
do
or
may
say
beware
of
a
priest
every
way
every
way
every

beware
of
a

every
way
well
said
tom
king
all
you
can
sing
or
say
do
alter
my
good
opinion
of
the
women
not
a
secret
have
i
from
the
girl
of
my
heart
she
could
have
sold
me
over
and
over
again
if
she
had
chosen
but
my
sweet
sue
is
not
the
wench
to
do
that
it
is
not
too
late
said
dick
your
delilah
may
yet
hand
you
over
to
the
philistines
then
i
shall
die
in
a
good
cause
said
king
but
the
tyburn
tree
has
no
terrors
for
me
let
better
men
swing
i
at
liberty
i
shall
never
come
to
the
unless
you
turn
topsman
dick
turpin
my
nativity
has
been
cast
and
the
stars
have
declared
i
am
to
die
by
the
hand
of
my
best
friend
and
that
you
eh
dick
it
sounds
like
it
replied
turpin
but
i
advise
you
not
to
become
too
intimate
with
jack
ketch
he
may
prove
your
best
friend
after
all
why
faith
that
true
replied
king
laughing
and
if
i
must
ride
backwards
up
holborn
hill
i
do
the
thing
in
style
and
honest
jack
ketch
shall
never
want
his
dues
a
man
should
always
die
game
we
none
of
us
know
how
soon
our
turn
may
come
but
come
when
it
will
shall
never
flinch
from
it
as
the
highwayman
life
is
the
fullest
of
zest
so
the
highwayman
death
is
the
briefest
and
best
he
dies
not
as
other
men
die
by
degrees
but
at
once
without
flinching
and
quite
at
his
ease
as
the
song
you
are
so
fond
of
says
when
i
die
it
will
not
be
of
consumption
and
if
the
surgeon
knife
must
come
near
me
it
will
be
after
death
there
some
comfort
in
that
reflection
at
all
events
true
replied
turpin
and
with
a
little
alteration
my
song
would
suit
you
capitally
there
is
not
a
king
should
you
search
the
world
round
so
blithe
as
the
king
king
tom
king
to
be
found
dear
woman
his
empire
each
girl
is
his
own
and
he
have
a
long
reign
if
he
let
alone
ha
ha
ha
ha
laughed
tom
and
now
dick
to
change
the
subject
you
are
off
i
understand
to
yorkshire
my
soul
you
are
a
wonderful
fellow
an
personified
here
and
everywhere
at
the
same
time
no
wonder
you
are
called
the
flying
highwayman
in
town
at
york
the
day
after
at
chester
the
devil
only
knows
where
you
will
pitch
your
quarters
a
week
hence
there
are
rumors
of
you
in
all
counties
at
the
same
moment
this
man
swears
you
robbed
him
at
hounslow
that
on
salisbury
plain
while
another
avers
you
monopolize
cheshire
and
yorkshire
and
that
it
is
safe
even
to
without
pops
in
your
pocket
i
heard
some
devilish
good
stories
of
you
at
day
the
fellow
who
told
them
to
me
little
thought
i
was
a
brother
blade
you
flatter
me
said
dick
smiling
complacently
but
it
no
merit
of
mine
black
bess
alone
enables
me
to
do
it
and
hers
be
the
credit
talking
of
being
everywhere
at
the
same
time
you
shall
hear
what
she
once
did
for
me
in
cheshire
meantime
a
glass
to
the
best
mare
in
england
you
wo
refuse
that
toast
tom
ah
if
your
mistress
is
only
as
true
to
you
as
my
nag
to
me
you
might
set
at
naught
the
tightest
hempen
cravat
that
was
ever
twisted
and
defy
your
best
friend
to
hurt
you
black
bess
and
god
bless
her
and
now
for
the
song
saying
which
with
much
emotion
turpin
chanted
the
following
rhymes
black
bess
let
the
lover
his
mistress
beauty
rehearse
and
laud
her
attractions
in
languishing
verse
be
it
mine
in
rude
strains
but
with
truth
to
express
the
love
that
i
bear
to
my
bonny
black
bess
from
the
west
was
her
dam
from
the
east
was
her
sire
from
the
one
came
her
swiftness
the
other
her
fire
no
peer
of
the
realm
better
blood
can
possess
than
flows
in
the
veins
of
my
bonny
black
bess
look
look
how
that
eyeball
grows
bright
as
a
brand
that
neck
proudly
arches
those
nostrils
expand
mark
that
wide
flowing
mane
of
which
each
silky
tress
might
adorn
prouder
beauties
though
none
like
black
bess
mark
that
skin
sleek
as
velvet
and
dusky
as
night
with
its
jet
undisfigured
by
one
lock
of
white
that
throat
branched
with
veins
prompt
to
charge
or
caress
now
is
she
not
beautiful
bonny
black
bess
over
highway
and
in
rough
and
smooth
weather
some
thousands
of
miles
have
we
journeyed
together
our
couch
the
same
straw
and
our
meal
the
same
mess
no
couple
more
constant
than
i
and
black
bess
by
moonlight
in
darkness
by
night
or
by
day
her
headlong
career
there
is
nothing
can
stay
she
cares
not
for
distance
she
knows
not
distress
can
you
show
me
a
courser
to
match
with
black
bess
egad
i
should
think
not
exclaimed
king
you
are
as
sentimental
on
the
subject
of
your
mare
as
i
am
when
i
think
of
my
darling
susan
but
pardon
my
interruption
pray
proceed
let
me
first
clear
my
throat
returned
dick
and
now
to
resume
once
it
happened
in
cheshire
near
dunham
i
popped
on
a
horseman
alone
whom
i
speedily
stopped
that
i
lightened
his
pockets
you
readily
guess
quick
work
makes
dick
turpin
when
mounted
on
bess
now
it
seems
the
man
knew
me
dick
turpin
said
he
you
shall
swing
for
this
job
as
you
live
d
see
i
laughed
at
his
threats
and
his
vows
of
redress
i
was
sure
of
an
then
with
black
bess
the
road
was
a
hollow
a
sunken
ravine
overshadowed
completely
by
wood
like
a
screen
i
clambered
the
bank
and
i
needs
must
confess
that
one
touch
of
the
spur
grazed
the
side
of
black
bess
brake
brook
meadow
and
plough
field
bess
fleetly
bestrode
as
the
crow
wings
her
flight
we
selected
our
road
we
arrived
at
hough
green
in
five
minutes
or
less
my
neck
it
was
saved
by
the
speed
of
black
bess
stepping
carelessly
forward
i
lounge
on
the
green
taking
excellent
care
that
by
all
i
am
seen
some
remarks
on
time
flight
to
the
squires
i
address
but
i
say
not
a
word
of
the
flight
of
black
bess
i
mention
the
hour
it
was
just
about
four
play
a
rubber
at
bowls
think
the
danger
is
when
athwart
my
next
game
like
a
checkmate
at
chess
comes
the
horsemen
in
search
of
the
rider
of
bess
what
matter
details
off
with
triumph
i
came
he
swears
to
the
hour
and
the
squires
swear
the
same
i
had
robbed
him
at
while
at
four
profess
i
was
quietly
bowling
all
thanks
to
black
bess
then
one
halloo
boys
one
loud
cheering
halloo
to
the
swiftest
of
coursers
the
gallant
the
true
for
the
sportsman
unborn

the
memory
bless
of
the
horse
of
the
highwayman
bonny
black
bess
loud
acclamations
rewarded
dick
performance
awakened
from
his
doze
zoroaster
beat
time
to
the
melody
the
only
thing
jerry
said
he
was
capable
of
in
his
present
shattered
condition
after
some
little
persuasion
the
magus
was
prevailed
upon
to
enliven
the
company
with
a
strain
which
he
trolled
forth
after
a
maudlin
manner
the
double
cross
though
all

in
a
tone
of
theatrical
valediction
as
i
said
before
the
best
friends

separate
we

soon
meet

or

king
i
afraid

chances

be
against

well
then
the
success
we
anticipate
if
you
prefer
it
rejoined
dick
i
have
only
to
observe
one
thing
more
namely
that
i
must
insist
upon
standing
sam
upon
the
present
occasion
not
a
word
i
wo
hear
a
syllable
landlord
i
say
what
oh
continued
dick
stepping
out
of
the
arbor
here
my
old
admiral
of
the
white
what
the
reckoning
to
pay
i
say
let
ye
know
directly
sir
replied
mine
host
of
the
falstaff
order
my
horse
the
black
mare
added
dick
and
mine
said
king
the
sorrel
colt
i
ride
with
you
a
mile
or
two
on
the
road
dick
perhaps
we
may
stumble
upon
something
very
likely
we
meet
at
twelve
at
jerry
said
king
if
nothing
happens
agreed
responded
juniper
what
say
you
to
a
rubber
at
bowls
in
the
mean
time
said
the
magus
taking
his
everlasting
pipe
from
his
lips
jerry
nodded
acquiescence
and
while
they
went
in
search
of
the
implements
of
the
game
turpin
and
king
sauntered
gently
on
the
green
it
was
a
delicious
evening
the
sun
was
slowly
declining
and
glowed
like
a
ball
of
fire
amid
the
thick
foliage
of
a
neighboring
elm
whether
like
the
robber
moor
tom
king
was
touched
by
this
glorious
sunset
we
pretend
not
to
determine
certain
it
was
that
a
shade
of
inexpressible
melancholy
passed
across
his
handsome
countenance
as
he
gazed
in
the
direction
of
hill
which
lying
to
the
west
of
the
green
upon
which
they
walked
stood
out
with
its
pointed
spire
and
lofty
college
against
the
ruddy
sky
he
spoke
not
but
dick
noticed
the
passing
emotion
what
ails
you
tom
said
he
with
much
kindness
of
manner
are
you
not
well
lad
yes
i
am
well
enough
said
king
i
know
not
what
came
over
me
but
looking
at
harrow
i
thought
of
my
school
days
and
what
i
was
and
that
bright
prospect
reminded
me
of
my
boyish
hopes
tut
tut
said
dick
this
is
idle
you
are
a
man
now
i
know
i
am
replied
tom
but
i
been
a
boy
had
i
any
faith
in
presentiments
i
should
say
this
is
the
last
sunset
i
shall
ever
see
here
comes
our
host
said
dick
smiling
i
no
presentiment
that
this
is
the
last
bill
i
shall
ever
pay
the
bill
was
brought
and
settled
as
turpin
paid
it
the
man
conduct
was
singular
and
awakened
his
suspicions
are
our
horses
ready
asked
dick
quickly
they
are
sir
said
the
landlord
let
us
be
gone
whispered
dick
to
king
i
do
like
this
manner
i
thought
i
heard
a
carriage
draw
up
at
the
inn
door
just
now
there
may
be
danger
be
fly
added
he
to
jerry
and
the
magus
now
sir
said
he
to
the
landlord
lead
the
way
keep
on
the
alert
tom
dick
hint
was
not
lost
upon
the
two
bowlers
they
watched
their
comrades
and
listened
intently
for
any
manifestation
of
alarm
was
this
well
done
jenny
while
turpin
and
king
are
walking
across
the
we
will
see
what
has
taken
place
outside
the
inn
tom
presentiments
of
danger
were
not
it
appeared
without
foundation
scarcely
had
the
ostler
brought
forth
our
two
highwaymen
steeds
when
a
escorted
by
two
or
three
horsemen
drove
furiously
up
to
the
door
the
sole
occupant
of
the
carriage
was
a
lady
whose
slight
and
pretty
figure
was
all
that
could
be
distinguished
her
face
being
closely
veiled
the
landlord
who
was
busied
in
casting
up
turpin
account
rushed
forth
at
the
summons
a
word
or
two
passed
between
him
and
the
horsemen
upon
which
the
former
countenance
fell
he
posted
in
the
direction
of
the
garden
and
the
horsemen
instantly
dismounted
we
have
him
now
sure
enough
said
one
of
them
a
very
small
man
who
looked
in
his
boots
like
buckle
equipped
for
the
oaks
by
the
powers
i
begin
to
think
so
replied
the
other
horseman
but
do
spoil
all
coates
by
being
too
precipitate
never
fear
that
tyrconnel
said
coates
for
it
was
the
gallant
attorney
he
sure
to
come
for
his
mare
that
a
certain
to
catch
him
eh
paterson
with
the
chief
constable
of
westminster
to
back
us
the
devil
in
it
if
we
are
not
a
match
for
him
and
for
tom
king
too
replied
the
chief
constable
since
his
blowen
peached
the
game
up
with
him
too
we
long
had
an
eye
upon
him
and
now
we
have
a
finger
he
one
of
your
dashing
trouts
to
whom
we
always
give
a
long
line
but
we
him
this
time
anyhow
if
you
look
after
dick
turpin
gemmen
i
make
sure
of
tom
i
rather
you
would
help
paterson
said
coates
never
mind
tom
king
another
time
will
do
for
him
no
such
thing
said
paterson
one
just
as
much
for
that
matter
as
i
take
tom
to
myself
and
surely
you
two
with
the
landlord
and
ostler
can
manage
turpin
amongst
you
i
do
know
that
said
coates
doubtfully
he
a
devil
of
a
fellow
to
deal
with
take
him
quietly
said
paterson
draw
the
chaise
out
of
the
way
lad
take
our
tits
to
one
side
and
place
their
nags
near
the
door
ostler
shall
you
be
able
to
see
him
where
you
are
asked
the
chief
constable
walking
to
the
carriage
and
touching
his
hat
to
the
lady
within
having
received
a
satisfactory
nod
from
the
bonnet
and
veil
he
returned
to
his
companions
and
now
gemmen
added
he
let
step
aside
a
little
do
use
your
too
soon
as
if
conscious
of
what
was
passing
around
her
and
of
the
danger
that
awaited
her
master
black
bess
exhibited
so
much
impatience
and
plunged
so
violently
that
it
was
with
difficulty
the
ostler
could
hold
her
the
devil
in
the
mare
said
he
what
the
matter
with
her
she
was
quiet
enough
a
few
minutes
since
soho
lass
stand
turpin
and
king
meanwhile
walked
quickly
through
the
house
preceded
by
the
host
who
conducted
them
and
not
without
some
inward
trepidation
towards
the
door
arrived
there
each
man
rushed
swiftly
to
his
horse
dick
was
in
the
saddle
in
an
instant
and
stamping
her
foot
on
the
ostler
leg
black
bess
compelled
the
man
yelling
with
pain
to
quit
his
hold
of
the
bridle
tom
king
was
not
equally
fortunate
before
he
could
mount
his
horse
a
loud
shout
was
raised
which
startled
the
animal
and
caused
him
to
swerve
so
that
tom
lost
his
footing
in
the
stirrup
and
fell
to
the
ground
he
was
instantly
seized
by
paterson
and
a
struggle
commenced
king
endeavoring
but
in
vain
to
draw
a
pistol
flip
him
dick
fire
or
i
taken
cried
king
fire
damn
you
why
do
you
fire
shouted
he
in
desperation
still
struggling
vehemently
with
paterson
who
was
a
strong
man
and
more
than
a
match
for
a
light
weight
like
king
i
ca
cried
dick
i
shall
hit
you
if
i
fire
take
your
chance
shouted
king
is
your
friendship
thus
urged
turpin
fired
the
ball
ripped
up
the
sleeve
of
coat
but
did
not
wound
him
again
cried
king
shoot
him
i
say
do
you
hear
me
fire
again
pressed
as
he
was
by
foes
on
every
side
himself
their
mark
for
both
coates
and
tyrconnel
had
fired
upon
him
and
were
now
mounting
their
steeds
to
give
chase
it
was
impossible
that
turpin
could
take
sure
aim
added
to
which
in
the
struggle
paterson
and
king
were
each
moment
changing
their
relative
positions
he
however
would
no
longer
hesitate
but
again
at
his
friend
request
fired
the
ball
lodged
itself
in
king
breast
he
fell
at
once
at
this
instant
a
shriek
was
heard
from
the
chaise
the
window
was
thrown
open
and
her
thick
veil
being
drawn
aside
the
features
of
a
very
pretty
female
now
impressed
with
terror
and
contrition
were
suddenly
exhibited
king
fixed
his
glazing
eyes
upon
her
susan
sighed
he
is
it
you
that
i
behold
yes
yes
is
she
sure
enough
said
paterson
you
see
what
you
and
such
like
have
brought
him
to
however
you
lose
your
reward
he
going
fast
enough
reward
gasped
king
reward
did
she
betray
me
ay
ay
sir
said
paterson
she
blowed
the
gaff
if
it
any
consolation
to
you
to
know
it
consolation
repeated
the
dying
man
perfidious
oh
the
prophecy
my
best
friend
turpin
i
die
by
his
hand
and
vainly
striving
to
raise
himself
he
fell
backwards
and
expired
alas
poor
tom
paterson
mr
paterson
cried
coates
leave
the
landlord
to
look
after
the
body
of
that
dying
ruffian
and
mount
with
us
in
pursuit
of
the
living
rascal
come
sir
quick
mount
despatch
you
see
he
is
yonder
he
seems
to
hesitate
we
shall
have
him
now
well
gemmen
i
ready
said
paterson
but
how
the
devil
came
you
to
let
him
escape
saint
patrick
only
knows
said
titus
he
as
slippery
as
an
eel
and
like
a
cat
turn
him
which
way
you
will
he
is
always
sure
to
alight
upon
his
legs
i
would
wonder
but
we
lose
him
now
after
all
though
he
has
such
a
small
start
that
mare
flies
like
the
wind
he
shall
have
a
tight
run
for
it
at
all
events
said
paterson
putting
spurs
into
his
horse
i
got
a
good
nag
under
me
and
you
are
neither
of
you
badly
mounted
he
only
three
hundred
yards
before
us
and
the
devil
in
it
if
we
ca
run
him
down
it
a
three
hundred
pound
job
coates
and
well
worth
a
race
you
shall
have
another
hundred
from
me
sir
if
you
take
him
said
coates
urging
his
steed
forward
thank
you
sir
thank
you
follow
my
directions
and
we
make
sure
of
him
said
the
constable
gently
gently
not
so
fast
up
the
hill
you
see
he
breathing
his
horse
all
in
good
time
coates
all
in
good
time
sir
and
maintaining
an
equal
distance
both
parties
cantered
leisurely
up
the
ascent
now
called
windmill
hill
we
shall
now
return
to
turpin
aghast
at
the
deed
he
had
accidentally
committed
dick
remained
for
a
few
moments
irresolute
he
perceived
that
king
was
mortally
wounded
and
that
all
attempts
at
rescue
would
be
fruitless
he
perceived
likewise
that
jerry
and
the
magus
had
effected
their
escape
from
the
as
he
could
detect
their
figures
stealing
along
the
he
hesitated
no
longer
turning
his
horse
he
galloped
slowly
off
little
heeding
the
pursuit
with
which
he
was
threatened
every
bullet
has
its
billet
said
dick
but
little
did
i
think
that
i
really
should
turn
poor
tom
executioner
to
the
devil
with
this
rascally
snapper
cried
he
throwing
the
pistol
over
the
hedge
i
could
never
have
used
it
again
is
strange
too
that
he
should
have
foretold
his
own
fate
devilish
strange
and
then
that
he
should
have
been
betrayed
by
the
very
blowen
he
trusted
that
a
lesson
if
i
wanted
any
but
trust
a
woman
not
i
the
length
of
my
little
finger
hue
and
six
gentlemen
upon
the
road
thus
seeing
gilpin
fly
with
postboy
scampering
in
the
rear
they
raised
the
hue
and
cry
stop
thief
stop
thief
a
highwayman
not
one
of
them
was
mute
and
all
and
each
that
passed
that
way
did
join
in
the
pursuit
arrived
at
the
brow
of
the
hill
whence
such
a
beautiful
view
of
the
country
surrounding
the
metropolis
is
obtained
turpin
turned
for
an
instant
to
reconnoitre
his
pursuers
coates
and
titus
he
utterly
disregarded
but
paterson
was
a
more
formidable
foe
and
he
well
knew
that
he
had
to
deal
with
a
man
of
experience
and
resolution
it
was
then
for
the
first
time
that
the
thoughts
of
executing
his
extraordinary
ride
to
york
first
flashed
across
him
his
bosom
throbbed
high
with
rapture
and
he
involuntarily
exclaimed
aloud
as
he
raised
himself
in
the
saddle
by
god
i
will
do
it
he
took
one
last
look
at
the
great
babel
that
lay
buried
in
a
world
of
trees
beneath
him
and
as
his
quick
eye
ranged
over
the
magnificent
prospect
lit
up
by
that
gorgeous
sunset
he
could
not
help
thinking
of
tom
king
last
words
poor
fellow
thought
dick
he
said
truly
he
will
never
see
another
sunset
aroused
by
the
approaching
clatter
of
his
pursuers
dick
struck
into
a
lane
which
lies
on
the
right
of
the
road
now
called
lane
and
set
off
at
a
good
pace
in
the
direction
of
hampstead
now
cried
paterson
put
your
tits
to
it
my
boys
we
must
not
lose
sight
of
him
for
a
second
in
these
lanes
accordingly
as
turpin
was
by
no
means
desirous
of
inconveniencing
his
mare
in
this
early
stage
of
the
business
and
as
the
ground
was
still
upon
an
ascent
the
parties
preserved
their
relative
distances
at
length
after
various
twistings
and
turnings
in
that
deep
and
devious
lane
after
scaring
one
or
two
farmers
and
riding
over
a
brood
or
two
of
ducks
dipping
into
the
verdant
valley
of
west
end
and
ascending
another
hill
turpin
burst
upon
the
gorsy
sandy
and
beautiful
heath
of
hampstead
shaping
his
course
to
the
left
dick
then
made
for
the
lower
part
of
the
heath
and
skirted
a
path
that
leads
towards
north
end
passing
the
summit
which
is
now
crested
by
a
clump
of
lofty
pines
it
was
here
that
the
chase
first
assumed
a
character
of
interest
being
open
ground
the
pursued
and
pursuers
were
in
full
view
of
each
other
and
as
dick
rode
swiftly
across
the
heath
with
the
shouting
trio
hard
at
his
heels
the
scene
had
a
very
animated
appearance
he
crossed
the
hill
the
hendon
road
passed
crackskull
common
and
dashed
along
the
cross
road
to
highgate
hitherto
no
advantage
had
been
gained
by
the
pursuers
they
had
not
lost
ground
but
still
they
had
not
gained
an
inch
and
much
spurring
was
required
to
maintain
their
position
as
they
approached
highgate
dick
slackened
his
pace
and
the
other
party
redoubled
their
efforts
to
avoid
the
town
dick
struck
into
a
narrow
path
at
the
right
and
rode
easily
down
the
hill
his
pursuers
were
now
within
a
hundred
yards
and
shouted
to
him
to
stand
pointing
to
a
gate
which
seemed
to
bar
their
further
progress
dick
unhesitatingly
charged
it
clearing
it
in
beautiful
style
not
so
with
coates
party
and
the
time
they
lost
in
unfastening
the
gate
which
none
of
them
chose
to
leap
enabled
dick
to
put
additional
space
betwixt
them
it
did
not
however
appear
to
be
his
intention
altogether
to
outstrip
his
pursuers
the
chase
seemed
to
give
him
excitement
which
he
was
willing
to
prolong
as
much
as
was
consistent
with
his
safety
scudding
rapidly
past
highgate
like
a
schooner
with
three
lumbering
indiamen
in
her
wake
dick
now
took
the
lead
along
a
narrow
lane
that
threads
the
fields
in
the
direction
of
hornsey
the
shouts
of
his
followers
had
brought
others
to
join
them
and
as
he
neared
crouch
end
traversing
the
lane
which
takes
its
name
from
and
in
which
a
house
frequented
by
that
gayest
of
robbers
stands
or
stood
a
highwayman
a
highwayman
rang
in
his
ears
in
a
discordant
chorus
of
many
voices
the
whole
neighborhood
was
alarmed
by
the
cries
and
by
the
tramp
of
horses
the
men
of
hornsey
rushed
into
the
road
to
seize
the
fugitive
and
women
held
up
their
babes
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
flying
cavalcade
which
seemed
to
gain
number
and
animation
as
it
advanced
suddenly
three
horsemen
appear
in
the
road
they
hear
the
uproar
and
the
din
a
highwayman
a
highwayman
cry
the
voices
stop
him
stop
him
but
it
is
no
such
easy
matter
with
a
pistol
in
each
hand
and
his
bridle
in
his
teeth
turpin
passed
boldly
on
his
fierce
looks
his
furious
steed
the
impetus
with
which
he
pressed
forward
bore
down
all
before
him
the
horsemen
gave
way
and
only
served
to
swell
the
list
of
his
pursuers
we
have
him
now
we
have
him
now
cried
paterson
exultingly
shout
for
your
lives
the
turnpike
man
will
hear
us
shout
again
again
the
fellow
has
heard
it
the
gate
is
shut
we
have
him
ha
ha
the
old
hornsey
was
a
high
gate
with
on
the
upper
rail
it
may
be
so
still
the
gate
was
swung
into
its
lock
and
like
a
tiger
in
his
lair
the
prompt
custodian
of
the
turnpike
trusts
ensconced
within
his
doorway
held
himself
in
readiness
to
spring
upon
the
runaway
but
dick
kept
steadily
on
he
coolly
calculated
the
height
of
the
gate
he
looked
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
nothing
better
offered
he
spoke
a
few
words
of
encouragement
to
bess
gently
patted
her
neck
then
struck
his
spurs
into
her
sides
and
cleared
the
spikes
by
an
inch
out
rushed
the
amazed
turnpike
man
thus
unmercifully
bilked
and
was
nearly
trampled
to
death
under
the
feet
of
horse
open
the
gate
fellow
and
be
expeditious
shouted
the
chief
constable
not
i
said
the
man
sturdily
unless
i
gets
my
dues
i
been
done
once
already
but
strike
me
stupid
if
i
done
a
second
time
do
you
perceive
that
a
highwayman
do
you
know
that
i
chief
constable
of
westminster
said
paterson
showing
his
staff
how
dare
you
oppose
me
in
the
discharge
of
my
duty
that
may
be
or
it
may
not
be
said
the
man
doggedly
but
you
pass
unless
i
gets
the
blunt
and
that
the
long
and
short
on
it
amidst
a
storm
of
oaths
coates
flung
down
a
crown
piece
and
the
gate
was
thrown
open
turpin
took
advantage
of
this
delay
to
breathe
his
mare
and
striking
into
a
at
duckett
green
cantered
easily
along
in
the
direction
of
tottenham
little
repose
was
allowed
him
yelling
like
a
pack
of
hounds
in
full
cry
his
pursuers
were
again
at
his
heels
he
had
now
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
the
long
straggling
town
of
tottenham
and
various
were
the
devices
of
the
populace
to
entrap
him
the
whole
place
was
up
in
arms
shouting
screaming
running
dancing
and
hurling
every
possible
description
of
missile
at
the
horse
and
her
rider
dick
merrily
responded
to
their
clamor
as
he
flew
past
and
laughed
at
the
brickbats
that
were
showered
thick
as
hail
and
quite
as
harmlessly
around
him
a
few
more
miles
hard
riding
tired
the
volunteers
and
before
the
chase
reached
edmonton
most
of
them
were
here
fresh
relays
were
gathered
and
a
strong
field
was
again
mustered
john
gilpin
himself
could
not
have
excited
more
astonishment
amongst
the
good
folks
of
edmonton
than
did
our
highwayman
as
he
galloped
through
their
town
unlike
the
men
of
tottenham
the
mob
received
him
with
acclamations
thinking
no
doubt
that
like
the
citizens
of
famous
london
town
he
rode
for
a
wager
presently
however
borne
on
the
wings
of
the
blast
came
the
cries
of
turpin
dick
turpin
and
the
hurrahs
were
changed
to
hootings
but
such
was
the
rate
at
which
our
highwayman
rode
that
no
serious
opposition
could
be
offered
to
him
a
man
in
a
unable
to
get
out
of
the
way
drew
himself
up
in
the
middle
of
the
road
turpin
treated
him
as
he
had
done
the
at
the
and
cleared
the
driver
and
his
little
wain
with
ease
this
was
a
capital
stroke
and
well
adapted
to
please
the
multitude
who
are
ever
taken
with
a
brilliant
action
hark
away
dick
resounded
on
all
hands
while
hisses
were
as
liberally
bestowed
upon
his
pursuers
short
the
peons
are
capital
horsemen
and
several
times
we
saw
them
at
a
gallop
throw
the
rein
on
the
horse
neck
take
from
one
pocket
a
bag
of
loose
tobacco
and
with
a
piece
of
paper
or
a
leaf
of
indian
corn
make
a
cigar
and
then
take
out
a
flint
and
steel
and
light
it
head
away
they
fly
past
scattered
cottages
swiftly
and
skimmingly
like
eagles
on
the
wing
along
the
enfield
highway
all
were
well
mounted
and
the
horses
now
thoroughly
warmed
had
got
into
their
paces
and
did
their
work
beautifully
none
of
coates
party
lost
ground
but
they
maintained
it
at
the
expense
of
their
steeds
which
were
streaming
like
while
black
bess
had
scarcely
turned
a
hair
turpin
the
reader
already
knows
was
a
crack
rider
he
was
crack
rider
of
england
of
his
time
and
perhaps
of
any
time
the
craft
and
mystery
of
jockeyship
was
not
so
well
understood
in
the
eighteenth
as
it
is
in
the
nineteenth
century
men
treated
their
horses
differently
and
few
rode
them
as
well
as
many
ride
now
when
every
youngster
takes
to
the
field
as
naturally
as
if
he
had
been
bred
a
guacho
dick
turpin
was
a
glorious
exception
to
the
rule
and
anticipated
a
later
age
he
rode
wonderfully
lightly
yet
sat
his
saddle
to
perfection
distributing
the
weight
so
exquisitely
that
his
horse
scarcely
felt
his
pressure
he
yielded
to
every
movement
made
by
the
animal
and
became
as
it
were
part
and
parcel
of
itself
he
took
care
bess
should
be
neither
strained
nor
wrung
freely
and
as
lightly
as
a
feather
was
she
borne
along
beautiful
was
it
to
see
her
action
to
watch
her
style
and
temper
of
covering
the
ground
and
many
a
meltonian
might
have
got
a
wrinkle
from
turpin
seat
and
conduct
we
have
before
stated
that
it
was
not
dick
object
to
from
his
pursuers
he
could
have
done
that
at
any
moment
he
liked
the
fun
of
the
chase
and
would
have
been
sorry
to
put
a
period
to
his
own
excitement
confident
in
his
mare
he
just
kept
her
at
such
speed
as
should
put
his
pursuers
completely
without
in
the
slightest
degree
inconveniencing
himself
some
judgment
of
the
speed
at
which
they
went
may
be
formed
when
we
state
that
little
better
than
an
hour
had
elapsed
and
nearly
twenty
miles
had
been
ridden
over
not
bad
travelling
that
methinks
we
hear
the
reader
exclaim
by
the
mother
that
bore
me
said
titus
as
they
went
along
in
this
slapping
style
titus
rode
a
big
powerful
horse
well
adapted
to
his
weight
but
which
required
a
plentiful
exercise
both
of
leg
and
arm
to
call
forth
all
his
action
and
keep
his
rider
alongside
his
companions
by
the
mother
that
bore
me
said
he
almost
thumping
the
wind
out
of
his
bucephalus
with
his
calves
after
the
irish
fashion
if
the
fellow
is
lighting
his
pipe
i
saw
the
sparks
fly
on
each
side
of
him
and
there
he
goes
like
a
smoky
chimney
on
a
frosty
morning
see
he
turns
his
impudent
phiz
with
the
pipe
in
his
mouth
are
we
to
stand
that
mr
coates
wait
awhile
sir
wait
awhile
said
coates
we
smoke
pæans
have
been
sung
in
honor
of
the
peons
of
the
pampas
by
the
sir
francis
but
what
the
gallant
major
extols
so
loudly
in
the
south
american
horsemen
the
lighting
of
a
cigar
when
in
mid
career
was
accomplished
with
equal
ease
by
our
english
highwayman
a
hundred
years
ago
nor
was
it
esteemed
by
him
any
extravagant
feat
either
flint
steel
and
tinder
were
bestowed
within
dick
ample
pouch
the
short
pipe
was
at
hand
and
within
a
few
seconds
there
was
a
stream
of
vapor
exhaling
from
his
lips
like
the
smoke
from
a
steamboat
shooting
down
the
river
and
tracking
his
still
rapid
course
through
the
air
i
let
see
what
i
think
of
said
dick
coolly
as
he
turned
his
head
it
was
now
gray
twilight
the
mists
of
coming
night
were
weaving
a
thin
curtain
over
the
rich
surrounding
landscape
all
the
sounds
and
hum
of
that
delicious
hour
were
heard
broken
only
by
the
regular
clatter
of
the
horses
hoofs
tired
of
shouting
the
chasers
now
kept
on
their
way
in
deep
silence
each
man
held
his
breath
and
plunged
his
spurs
rowel
deep
into
his
horse
but
the
animals
were
already
at
the
top
of
their
speed
and
incapable
of
greater
exertion
paterson
who
was
a
hard
rider
and
perhaps
a
thought
better
mounted
kept
the
lead
the
rest
followed
as
they
might
had
it
been
undisturbed
by
the
rush
of
the
cavalcade
the
scene
would
have
been
still
and
soothing
overhead
a
cloud
of
rooks
were
winging
their
garrulous
flight
to
the
ancestral
avenue
of
an
ancient
mansion
to
the
right
the
bat
was
on
the
wing
the
distant
lowing
of
a
herd
of
kine
saluted
the
ear
at
intervals
the
blithe
whistle
of
the
rustic
herdsman
and
the
merry
chime
of
waggon
bells
rang
pleasantly
from
afar
but
these
cheerful
sounds
which
make
the
still
twilight
hour
delightful
were
lost
in
the
tramp
of
the
horsemen
now
three
abreast
the
hind
fled
to
the
hedge
for
shelter
and
the
waggoner
pricked
up
his
ears
and
fancied
he
heard
the
distant
rumbling
of
an
earthquake
on
rush
the
pack
whipping
spurring
tugging
for
very
life
again
they
gave
voice
in
hopes
the
waggoner
might
succeed
in
stopping
the
fugitive
but
dick
was
already
by
his
side
harkee
my
tulip
cried
he
taking
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
as
he
passed
tell
my
friends
behind
they
will
hear
of
me
at
york
what
did
he
say
asked
paterson
coming
up
the
next
moment
that
you
find
him
at
york
replied
the
waggoner
at
york
echoed
coates
in
amaze
turpin
was
now
out
of
sight
and
although
our
trio
flogged
with
might
and
main
they
could
never
catch
a
glimpse
of
him
until
within
a
short
distance
of
ware
they
beheld
him
at
the
door
of
a
little
public
house
standing
with
his
bridle
in
his
hand
coolly
quaffing
a
tankard
of
ale
no
sooner
were
they
in
sight
than
dick
vaulted
into
the
saddle
and
rode
off
devil
seize
you
sir
why
did
you
stop
him
exclaimed
paterson
as
he
rode
up
my
horse
is
dead
lame
i
can
not
go
any
further
do
you
know
what
a
prize
you
have
missed
do
you
know
who
that
was
no
sir
i
do
said
the
publican
but
i
know
he
gave
his
mare
more
ale
than
he
took
himself
and
he
has
given
me
a
guinea
instead
of
a
shilling
he
a
regular
good
a
good
said
paterson
it
was
turpin
the
notorious
highwayman
we
are
in
pursuit
of
him
have
you
any
horses
our
cattle
are
all
blown

the
town

very
good
evening

the
publican
retreated
to
his
domicile
that

said
paterson
i
chalk
you
down
my
friend

may
rely
upon
it
thus
far

coates
but
curse
me
if
i
give
it
in
i
follow
him
to
the
world
end
first
right
sir
right
said
the
attorney
a
very
proper
spirit
constable
you
would
be
guilty
of
neglecting
your
duty
were
you
to
act
otherwise
you
must
recollect
my
father
paterson
christopher
or
kit
coates
a
name
as
well
known
at
the
old
bailey
as
jonathan
wild
you
recollect
him
eh
perfectly
well
sir
replied
the
chief
constable
the
greatest
though
i
say
it
continued

inherit
all
his
zeal

his
ardor

to
the
they
went
and
with
as
little
delay
as
circumstances
admitted
fresh
hacks
being
procured
accompanied
by
a
postilion
the
party
again
pursued
their
onward
course
encouraged
to
believe
they
were
still
in
the
right
scent
night
had
now
spread
her
mantle
over
the
earth
still
it
was
not
wholly
dark
a
few
stars
were
twinkling
in
the
deep
cloudless
heavens
and
a
pearly
radiance
in
the
eastern
horizon
heralded
the
rising
of
the
orb
of
night
a
gentle
breeze
was
stirring
the
dews
of
evening
had
already
fallen
and
the
air
felt
bland
and
dry
it
was
just
the
night
one
would
have
chosen
for
a
ride
if
one
ever
rode
by
choice
at
such
an
hour
and
to
turpin
whose
chief
excursions
were
conducted
by
night
it
appeared
little
less
than
heavenly
full
of
ardor
and
excitement
determined
to
execute
what
he
had
mentally
undertaken
turpin
held
on
his
solitary
course
everything
was
favorable
to
his
project
the
roads
were
in
admirable
condition
his
mare
was
in
like
order
she
was
inured
to
hard
work
had
rested
sufficiently
in
town
to
recover
from
the
fatigue
of
her
recent
journey
and
had
never
been
in
more
perfect
training
she
has
now
got
her

what
she

he

almost

by
her

started
forward
at
a
pace
which
few
horses
could
have
equalled
and
scarcely
any
have
sustained
so
long
even
dick
accustomed
as
he
was
to
her
magnificent

electrified
at
the
speed

was

along

hark
away

the
deep
and
solemn

through
which
they
were
rushing
rang
with
his
shouts
and
the
sharp
rattle
of

and
thus
he
held
his
way
while
in
the
words
of
the
ballad
fled
past

and
left
how

a
noble
steed
was
she
her
sire
was
blood
and
blood
her
dam
and
all
her
pedigree
as
to
her
pedigree
her
sire
was
a
desert
arab
renowned
in
his
day
and
brought
to
this
country
by
a
wealthy
traveller
her
dam
was
an
english
racer
as
her
child
bess
united
all
the
fire
and
gentleness
the
strength
and
hardihood
the
abstinence
and
endurance
of
fatigue
of
the
one
with
the
spirit
and
extraordinary
fleetness
of
the
other
how
turpin
became
possessed
of
her
is
of
little
consequence
we
never
heard
that
he
paid
a
heavy
price
for
her
though
we
doubt
if
any
sum
would
have
induced
him
to
part
with
her
in
color
she
was
perfectly
black
with
a
skin
smooth
on
the
surface
as
polished
jet
not
a
single
white
hair
could
be
detected
in
her
satin
coat
in
make
she
was
magnificent
every
point
was
perfect
beautiful
compact
modelled
in
little
for
strength
and
speed
arched
was
her
neck
as
that
of
the
swan
clean
and
fine
were
her
lower
limbs
as
those
of
the
gazelle
round
and
sound
as
a
drum
was
her
carcase
and
as
broad
as
a
shaft
her
width
of
chest
hers
were
the
clunes
breve
caput
arduaque
of
the
roman
bard
there
was
no
redundancy
of
flesh
is
true
her
flanks
might
to
please
some
tastes
have
been
rounder
and
her
shoulders
fuller
but
look
at
the
nerve
and
sinew
palpable
through
the
veined
limbs
she
was
built
more
for
strength
than
beauty
and
yet
she
beautiful
look
at
that
elegant
little
head
those
thin
tapering
ears
closely
placed
together
that
broad
snorting
nostril
which
seems
to
snuff
the
gale
with
disdain
that
eye
glowing
and
large
as
the
diamond
of
giamschid
is
she
not
beautiful
behold
her
paces
how
gracefully
she
moves
she
is
off
no
eagle
on
the
wing
could
skim
the
air
more
swiftly
is
she
not
superb
as
to
her
temper
the
lamb
is
not
more
gentle
a
child
might
guide
her
but
hark
back
to
dick
turpin
we
left
him
rattling
along
in
superb
style
and
in
the
highest
possible
glee
he
could
not
in
fact
be
otherwise
than
exhilarated
nothing
being
so
wildly
intoxicating
as
a
mad
gallop
we
seem
to
start
out
of
ourselves
to
be
endued
for
the
time
with
new
energies
our
thoughts
take
wings
rapid
as
our
steed
we
feel
as
if
his
fleetness
and
boundless
impulses
were
for
the
moment
our
own
we
laugh
we
exult
we
shout
for
very
joy
we
cry
out
with
mephistopheles
but
in
anything
but
a
sardonic
mood
what
i
enjoy
with
spirit
is
it
the
less
my
own
on
that
account
if
i
can
pay
for
six
horses
are
not
their
powers
mine
i
drive
along
and
am
a
proper
man
as
if
i
had
legs
these
were
turpin
sentiments
precisely
give
him
four
legs
and
a
wide
plain
and
he
needed
no
mephistopheles
to
bid
him
ride
to
perdition
as
fast
as
his
nag
could
carry
him
away
away
the
road
is
level
the
path
is
clear
press
on
thou
gallant
steed
no
obstacle
is
in
thy
way
and
lo
the
moon
breaks
forth
her
silvery
light
is
thrown
over
the
woody
landscape
dark
shadows
are
cast
athwart
the
road
and
the
flying
figures
of
thy
rider
and
thyself
are
traced
like
giant
phantoms
in
the
dust
away
away
our
breath
is
gone
in
keeping
up
with
this
tremendous
run
yet
dick
turpin
has
not
lost
his
wind
for
we
hear
his
cheering
cry
hark
he
sings
the
reader
will
bear
in
mind
that
oliver
means
the
moon
to
whiddle
is
to
blab
oliver
whiddles
oliver
whiddles
the
tattler
old
telling
what
best
had
been
left
untold
oliver
was
a
friend
of
mine
all
glims
i
hate
that
so
brightly

give
me
a
night
black
as

and
then
see
what
i
show
to
you
my
merry
men
oliver

who
cares
who
cares
if
down
upon
us
he
peers
and
stares
mind
him
who
will
with
his
great
white
face
boldly
ride
by
his
glim
to
the
chase
give
him
a
rowland
and
loudly
as
ever
shout
as
i
show
myself
stand
and
deliver

as
he
concluded
his
song
looking
up
at
the

old
noll
no
bad
fellow
either
i
would
be
without
his
white
face
for
a
trifle
he
as
good
as
a
lamp
to
guide
one
and
let
bess
only
hold
on
as
she
goes
now
and
i
do
it
with
ease
softly
wench
softly
dost
not
see
it
a
hill
we
rising
the
devil
in
the
mare
she
cares
for
nothing
and
as
they
ascended
the
hill
voice
once
more
awoke
the
echoes
of
night
will
davies
and
dick
turpin
hodiè

cràs
saint
augustin
one
night
when
mounted
on
my
mare
to
bagshot
heath
i
did
repair
and
saw
will
davies
hanging
there
upon
the
gibbet
bleak
and
bare
a
rustified
fustified
mustified
air
within
his
chains
bold
will
looked
blue
gone
were
his
sword
and
snappers
too
which
served
their
master
well
and
true
says
i
will
davies
how
are
you
your
rustified
fustified
mustified
air
says
he
dick
turpin
here
i
be
upon
the
gibbet
as
you
see
i
take
the
matter
easily
have
your
turn
as
well
as
me
your
air
says
i
that
very
true
my
lad
meantime
with
pistol
and
with
prad
i
quite
contented
as
i
am
and
heed
the
gibbet
not
a
d
n
its
rustified
fustified
mustified
air
poor
will
davies
sighed
dick
bagshot
ought
never
to
forget
him
for
never
more
shall
bagshot
see
a
highwayman
of
such
degree
appearance
and
gentility
as
will
who
hangs
upon
the
tree
his
rustified
fustified
mustified
air
well
mused
turpin
i
suppose
one
day
it
will
be
with
me
like
all
the
rest
of
and
that
i
shall
dance
a
long
lavolta
to
the
music
of
the
four
whistling
winds
as
my
betters
have
done
before
me
but
i
trust
whenever
the
and
scribblers
get
hold
of
me
they
at
least
put
no
cursed
nonsense
into
my
mouth
but
make
me
speak
as
i
have
ever
felt
like
a
man
who
never
either
feared
death
or
turned
his
back
upon
his
friend
in
the
mean
time
i
give
them
something
to
talk
about
this
ride
of
mine
shall
ring
in
their
ears
long
after
i
done
for
put
to
bed
with
a
mattock
and
tucked
up
with
a
spade
and
when
i
am
gone
boys
each
huntsman
shall
say
none
rode
like
dick
turpin
so
far
in
a
day
and
thou
too
brave
bess
thy
name
shall
be
linked
with
mine
and
we
go
down
to
posterity
together
and
what
added
he
despondingly
if
it
should
be
too
much
for
thee
what
if
but
no
matter
better
die
now
while
i
am
with
thee
than
fall
into
the
knacker
hands
better
die
with
all
thy
honors
upon
thy
head
than
drag
out
thy
old
age
at
the
hark
forward
lass
hark
forward
by
what
peculiar
instinct
is
it
that
this
noble
animal
the
horse
will
at
once
perceive
the
slightest
change
in
his
rider
physical
temperament
and
allow
himself
so
to
be
influenced
by
it
that
according
as
his
master
spirits
fluctuate
will
his
own
energies
rise
and
fall
wavering
from
walk
to
trot
from
canter
to
full
speed
how
is
it
we
ask
of
those
more
intimately
acquainted
with
the
metaphysics
of
the
houyhnhnm
than
we
pretend
to
be
do
the
saddle
or
the
rein
convey
like
metallic
tractors
vibrations
of
the
spirit
betwixt
the
two
we
know
not
but
this
much
is
certain
that
no
servant
partakes
so
much
of
the
character
of
his
master
as
the
horse
the
steed
we
are
wont
to
ride
becomes
a
portion
of
ourselves
he
thinks
and
feels
with
us
as
we
are
lively
he
is
sprightly
as
we
are
depressed
his
courage
droops
in
proof
of
this
let
the
reader
see
what
horses
some
men
make
we
say
because
in
such
hands
their
character
is
wholly
altered
partaking
in
a
measure
of
the
courage
and
the
firmness
of
the
hand
that
guides
them
and
of
the
resolution
of
the
frame
that
sways
them
what
their
rider
wills
they
do
or
strive
to
do
when
that
governing
power
is
relaxed
their
energies
are
relaxed
likewise
and
their
fine
sensibilities
supply
them
with
an
instant
knowledge
of
the
disposition
and
capacity
of
the
rider
a
gift
of
the
gods
is
the
gallant
steed
which
like
any
other
faculty
we
possess
to
use
or
to
abuse
to
command
or
to
neglect
rests
with
ourselves
he
is
the
best
general
test
of
our
own
black
bess
action
amply
verified
what
we
have
just
asserted
for
during
turpin
momentary
despondency
her
pace
was
perceptibly
diminished
and
her
force
retarded
but
as
he
revived
she
rallied
instantly
and
seized
apparently
with
a
kindred
enthusiasm
snorted
joyously
as
she
recovered
her
speed
now
was
it
that
the
child
of
the
desert
showed
herself
the
undoubted
offspring
of
the
hardy
loins
from
whence
she
sprung
full
fifty
miles
had
she
sped
yet
she
showed
no
symptoms
of
distress
if
possible
she
appeared
fresher
than
when
she
started
she
had
breathed
her
limbs
were
suppler
her
action
was
freer
easier
lighter
her
sire
who
upon
his
trackless
wilds
could
have
outstripped
the
pestilent
simoom
and
with
throat
unslaked
and
hunger
unappeased
could
thrice
have
seen
the
scorching
sun
go
down
had
not
greater
powers
of
endurance
his
vigor
was
her
heritage
her
dam
who
upon
the
velvet
sod
was
of
almost
unapproachable
swiftness
and
who
had
often
brought
her
owner
golden
assurances
of
her
worth
could
scarce
have
kept
pace
with
her
and
would
have
sunk
under
a
third
of
her
fatigue
but
bess
was
a
paragon
we
shall
look
upon
her
like
again
unless
we
can
prevail
upon
some
bedouin
chief
to
present
us
with
a
brood
mare
and
then
the
racing
world
shall
see
what
a
breed
we
will
introduce
into
this
country
eclipse
childers
or
hambletonian
shall
be
nothing
to
our
colts
and
even
the
railroad
slow
travelling
compared
with
the
speed
of
our
new
nags
but
to
return
to
bess
or
rather
to
go
along
with
her
for
there
is
no
halting
now
we
are
going
at
the
rate
of
twenty
knots
an
hour
sailing
before
the
wind
and
the
reader
must
either
keep
pace
with
us
or
drop
astern
bess
is
now
in
her
speed
and
dick
happy
happy
he
is
enraptured
maddened
furious
intoxicated
as
with
wine
pshaw
wine
could
never
throw
him
into
such
a
burning
delirium
its
choicest
juices
have
no
inspiration
like
this
its
fumes
are
slow
and
heady
this
is
ethereal
transporting
his
blood
spins
through
his
veins
winds
round
his
heart
mounts
to
his
brain
away
away
he
is
wild
with
joy
hall
cot
tree
tower
glade
mead
waste
or
woodland
are
seen
passed
left
behind
and
vanish
as
in
a
dream
motion
is
scarcely
perceptible
it
is
impetus
volition
the
horse
and
her
rider
are
driven
forward
as
it
were
by

a
hamlet
is
visible
in
the
moonlight
it
is
scarcely
discovered
ere
the
flints
sparkle
beneath
the
mare
hoofs
a
moment
clatter
upon
the
stones
and
it
is
left
behind
again
it
is
the
silent
smiling
country
now
they
are
buried
in
the
darkness
of
woods
now
sweeping
along
on
the
wide
plain
now
clearing
the
unopened
now
trampling
over
the
bridge
their
shadows
momently
reflected
in
the
placid
mirror
of
the
stream
now
scaling
the
a
thought
more
slowly
now
plunging
as
the
horses
of
phœbus
into
the
ocean
down
its
precipitous
sides
the
limits
of
two
shires
are
already
past
they
are
within
the
confines
of
a
third
they
have
entered
the
merry
county
of
huntingdon
they
have
surmounted
the
gentle
hill
that
slips
into
godmanchester
they
are
by
the
banks
of
the
rapid
ouse
the
bridge
is
past
and
as
turpin
rode
through
the
deserted
streets
of
huntingdon
he
heard
the
eleventh
hour
given
from
the
iron
tongue
of
mary
spire
in
four
hours
it
was
about
seven
when
he
started
dick
had
accomplished
full
sixty
miles
a
few
reeling
topers
in
the
streets
saw
the
horseman
flit
past
and
one
or
two
windows
were
thrown
open
but
peeping
tom
of
coventry
would
have
had
small
chance
of
beholding
the
unveiled
beauties
of
queen
godiva
had
she
ridden
at
the
rate
of
dick
turpin
he
was
gone
like
a
meteor
almost
as
soon
as
he
appeared
huntingdon
is
left
behind
and
he
is
once
more
surrounded
by
hedges
and
silent
slumbering
trees
broad
meadows
or
pasture
land
with
drowsy
cattle
or
low
bleating
sheep
lie
on
either
side
but
what
to
turpin
at
that
moment
is
nature
animate
or
inanimate
he
thinks
only
of
his
mare
his
future
fame
none
are
by
to
see
him
ride
no
stimulating
plaudits
ring
in
his
ears
no
thousand
hands
are
clapping
no
thousand
voices
huzzaing
no
handkerchiefs
are
waved
no
necks
strained
no
bright
eyes
rain
influence
upon
him
no
eagle
orbs
watch
his
motions
no
bells
are
rung
no
cup
awaits
his
achievement
no
sweepstakes
no
plate
but
his
will
be
renown
everlasting
renown
his
will
be
fame
which
will
not
die
with
him
which
will
keep
his
reputation
albeit
a
tarnished
one
still
in
the
mouths
of
men
he
wants
all
these
adventitious
excitements
but
he
has
that
within
which
is
a
greater
excitement
than
all
these
he
is
conscious
that
he
is
doing
a
deed
to
live
by
if
not
riding
for
he
is
riding
for
and
as
the
hero
may
perchance
feel
for
even
a
highwayman
may
feel
like
a
hero
when
he
willingly
throws
away
his
existence
in
the
hope
of
earning
a
glorious
name
turpin
cared
not
what
might
befall
himself
so
he
could
proudly
signalize
himself
as
the
first
of
his
land
witch
the
world
with
noble
horsemanship
what
need
had
he
of
spectators
the
eye
of
posterity
was
upon
him
he
felt
the
influence
of
that
argus
glance
which
has
made
many
a
poor
wight
spur
on
his
pegasus
with
not
half
so
good
a
chance
of
reaching
the
goal
as
dick
turpin
multitudes
yet
unborn
he
knew
would
hear
and
laud
his
deeds
he
trembled
with
excitement
and
bess
trembled
under
him
but
the
emotion
was
transient
on
on

fly
the

balmy

beautiful
with
a
bright
array
of
stars
and
a
golden
harvest
moon
which
seemed
to
diffuse
even
warmth
with
its
radiance
but
now
turpin
was
approaching
the
region
of
fog
and
fen
and
he
began
to
feel
the
influence
of
that
dank
atmosphere
the
intersecting
dykes
yawners
gullies
or
whatever
they
are
called
began
to
send
forth
their
steaming
vapors
and
chilled
the
soft
and
wholesome
air
obscuring
the
void
and
in
some
instances
as
it
were
choking
up
the
road
itself
with
vapor
but
fog
or
fen
was
the
same
to
bess
her
hoofs
rattled
merrily
along
the
road
and
she
burst
from
a
cloud
like
eöus
at
the
break
of
dawn
it
chanced
as
he
issued
from
a
fog
of
this
kind
that
turpin
burst
upon
the
york
stage
coach
it
was
no
uncommon
thing
for
the
coach
to
be
stopped
and
so
furious
was
the
career
of
our
highwayman
that
the
man
involuntarily
drew
up
his
horses
turpin
had
also
to
draw
in
the
rein
a
task
of
no
little
difficulty
as
charging
a
huge
lumbering
coach
with
its
full
complement
of
passengers
was
more
than
even
bess
could
accomplish
the
moon
shone
brightly
on
turpin
and
his
mare
he
was
unmasked
and
his
features
were
distinctly
visible
an
exclamation
was
uttered
by
a
gentleman
on
the
box
who
it
appeared
instantly
recognized
him
pull
up
draw
your
horses
across
the
road
cried
the
gentleman
that
dick
turpin
the
highwayman
his
capture
would
be
worth
three
hundred
pounds
to
you
added
he
addressing
the
coachman
and
is
of
equal
importance
to
me
stand
shouted
he
presenting
a
cocked
pistol
this
resolution
of
the
gentleman
was
not
apparently
agreeable
either
to
the
coachman
or
the
majority
of
the
passengers
the
name
of
turpin
acting
like
magic
upon
them
one
man
jumped
off
behind
and
was
with
difficulty
afterwards
recovered
having
tumbled
into
a
deep
ditch
at
the
roadside
an
old
gentleman
with
a
cotton
nightcap
who
had
popped
out
his
head
to
swear
at
the
coachman
drew
it
suddenly
back
a
faint
scream
in
a
female
key
issued
from
within
and
there
was
a
considerable
hubbub
on
the
roof
amongst
other
ominous
sounds
the
guard
was
heard
to
click
his
long
stop
the
york
stage
said
he
forcing
his
smoky
voice
through
a
world
of
shawl
the
fastest
coach
in
the
kingdom
vos
ever
such
atrocity
heard
of
i
say
joe
keep
them
ere
leaders
steady
we
shall
all
be
in
the
ditch
do
you
see
where
the
hind
wheels
are
who
whoop
i
say
the
gentleman
on
the
box
now
discharged
his
pistol
and
the
confusion
within
was
redoubled
the
white
nightcap
was
popped
out
like
a
head
and
as
quickly
popped
back
on
hearing
the
highwayman
voice
owing
to
the
plunging
of
the
horses
the
gentleman
had
missed
his
aim
prepared
for
such
emergencies
as
the
present
and
seldom
at
any
time
taken
aback
dick
received
the
fire
without
flinching
he
then
lashed
the
horses
out
of
his
course
and
rode
up
pistol
in
hand
to
the
gentleman
who
had
fired
major
mowbray
said
he
in
a
stern
tone
i
know
you
i
meant
not
either
to
assault
you
or
these
gentlemen
yet
you
have
attempted
my
life
sir
a
second
time
but
you
are
now
in
my
power
and
by
hell
if
you
do
not
answer
the
questions
i
put
to
you
nothing
earthly
shall
save
you
if
you
ask
aught
i
may
not
answer
fire
said
the
major
i
will
never
ask
life
from
such
as
you
have
you
seen
aught
of
sir
luke
rookwood
asked
dick
the
villain
you
mean
is
not
yet
secured
replied
the
major
but
we
have
traces
of
him
is
with
a
view
of
procuring
more
efficient
assistance
that
i
ride
to
town
they
have
not
met
then
since
said
dick
carelessly
met
whom
do
you
mean
your
sister
and
sir
luke
said
dick
my
sister
meet
him
cried
the
major
angrily
think
you
he
dares
show
himself
at
rookwood
ho
ho
laughed
dick
she
at
rookwood
then
a
thousand
thanks
major
good
night
to
you
gentlemen
take
that
with
you
and
remember
the
guard
cried
the
fellow
who
unable
to
take
aim
from
where
he
sat
had
crept
along
the
coach
roof
and
discharged
thence
one
of
his
large
at
what
he
took
to
be
the
highwayman
head
but
which
luckily
for
dick
was
his
hat
which
he
had
raised
to
salute
the
passengers
remember
you
said
dick
coolly
replacing
his
perforated
beaver
on
his
brow
you
may
rely
upon
it
my
fine
fellow
i
not
forget
you
the
next
time
we
meet
and
off
he
went
like
the
breath
of
the
whirlwind
take
my
horse
and
dash
a
bottle
of
wine
over
him
was
hot
work
schiller
we
will
now
make
inquiries
after
coates
and
his
party
of
whom
both
we
and
dick
turpin
have
for
some
time
lost
sight
with
unabated
ardor
the
vindictive
man
of
law
and
his
myrmidons
pressed
forward
a
tacit
compact
seemed
to
have
been
entered
into
between
the
highwayman
and
his
pursuers
that
he
was
to
fly
while
they
were
to
follow
like
bloodhounds
they
kept
steadily
upon
his
trail
nor
were
they
so
far
behind
as
dick
imagined
at
each
they
passed
they
obtained
fresh
horses
and
while
these
were
saddling
a
postboy
was
despatched
to
order
relays
at
the
next
station
in
this
manner
they
proceeded
after
the
first
stoppage
without
interruption
horses
were
in
waiting
for
them
as
they
bloody
with
spurring
fiery
hot
with
haste
and
their
jaded
hacks
arrived
turpin
had
been
heard
or
seen
in
all
quarters
waggoners
carters
trampers
all
had
seen
him
besides
strange
as
it
may
sound
they
placed
some
faith
in
his
word
york
they
believed
would
be
his
destination
at
length
the
coach
which
dick
had
encountered
hove
in
sight
there
was
another
stoppage
and
another
hubbub
the
old
gentleman
nightcap
was
again
manifested
and
suffered
a
sudden
occultation
as
upon
the
former
occasion
the
postboy
who
was
in
advance
had
halted
and
given
up
his
horse
to
major
mowbray
who
exchanged
his
seat
on
the
box
for
one
on
the
saddle
deeming
it
more
expedient
after
his
interview
with
turpin
to
return
to
rookwood
rather
than
to
proceed
to
town
the
postboy
was
placed
behind
coates
as
being
the
lightest
weight
and
thus
reinforced
the
party
pushed
forward
as
rapidly
as
heretofore
eighty
and
odd
miles
had
now
been
traversed
the
boundary
of
another
county
northampton
passed
yet
no
rest
nor
respite
had
dick
turpin
or
his
unflinching
mare
enjoyed
but
here
he
deemed
it
fitting
to
make
a
brief
halt
bordering
the
beautiful
domains
of
burleigh
house
stood
a
little
retired
hostelry
of
some
antiquity
which
bore
the
great
lord
treasurer
arms
with
this
house
dick
was
not
altogether
unacquainted
the
lad
who
acted
as
ostler
was
known
to
him
it
was
now
midnight
but
a
bright
and
beaming
night
to
the
door
of
the
stable
then
did
he
ride
and
knocked
in
a
peculiar
manner
reconnoitering
dick
through
a
broken
pane
of
glass
in
the
lintel
and
apparently
satisfied
with
his
scrutiny
the
lad
thrust
forth
a
head
of
hair
as
full
of
straw
as
mad
tom
is
represented
to
be
upon
the
stage
a
chuckle
of
welcome
followed
his
sleepy
salutation
glad
to
see
you
captain
turpin
said
he
can
i
do
anything
for
you
get
me
a
couple
of
bottles
of
brandy
and
a
beefsteak
said
dick
as
to
the
brandy
you
can
have
that
in
a
jiffy
but
the
steak
lord
love
you
the
old
ooman
wo
stand
it
at
this
time
but
there
a
cold
round
mayhap
a
slice
of
that
might
do
or
a
knuckle
of
ham
a
pest
on
your
knuckles
ralph
cried
dick
have
you
any
raw
meat
in
the
house
raw
meat
echoed
ralph
in
surprise
oh
yes
there
a
rare
rump
of
beef
you
can
have
a
cut
off
that
if
you
like
that
the
thing
i
want
said
dick
ungirthing
his
mare
give
me
the
scraper
there
i
can
get
a
whisp
of
straw
from
your
head
now
run
and
get
the
brandy
better
bring
three
bottles
uncork
and
let
me
have
half
a
pail
of
water
to
mix
with
the
spirit
a
pail
full
of
brandy
and
water
to
wash
down
a
raw
steak
my
eyes
exclaimed
ralph
opening
wide
his
sleepy
peepers
adding
as
he
went
about
the
execution
of
his
task
i
always
thought
them
as
they
call
themselves
rum
fellows
but
now
i
sartin
sure
on
it
the
most
sedulous
groom
could
not
have
bestowed
more
attention
upon
the
horse
of
his
heart
than
dick
turpin
now
paid
to
his
mare
he
scraped
chafed
and
dried
her
sounded
each
muscle
traced
each
sinew
pulled
her
ears
examined
the
state
of
her
feet
and
ascertaining
that
her
withers
were
finally
washed
her
from
head
to
foot
in
the
diluted
spirit
not
however
before
he
had
conveyed
a
thimbleful
of
the
liquid
to
his
own
parched
throat
and
replenished
what
falstaff
calls
a
which
he
had
about
him
while
ralph
was
engaged
in
rubbing
her
down
after
her
bath
dick
occupied
himself
not
in
dressing
the
raw
steak
in
the
manner
the
had
anticipated
but
in
rolling
it
round
the
bit
of
his
bridle
she
will
now
go
as
long
as
there
breath
in
her
body
said
he
putting
the
iron
within
her
mouth
the
saddle
being
once
more
replaced
after
champing
a
moment
or
two
at
the
bit
bess
began
to
snort
and
paw
the
earth
as
if
impatient
of
delay
and
acquainted
as
he
was
with
her
indomitable
spirit
and
power
her
condition
was
a
surprise
even
to
dick
himself
her
vigor
seemed
inexhaustible
her
vivacity
was
not
a
whit
diminished
but
as
she
was
led
into
the
open
space
her
step
became
as
light
and
free
as
when
she
started
on
her
ride
and
her
sense
of
sound
as
quick
as
ever
suddenly
she
pricked
her
ears
and
uttered
a
low
neigh
a
dull
tramp
was
audible
ha
exclaimed
dick
springing
into
his
saddle
they
come
who
come
captain
asked
ralph
the
road
takes
a
turn
here
do
it
asked
dick
sweeps
round
to
the
right
by
the
plantations
in
the
hollow
ay
ay
captain
answered
ralph
it
plain
you
knows
the
ground
what
lies
behind
yon
shed
a
stiff
fence
captain
a
rasper
beyond
that
a
steep
as
a
house
no
oss
as
was
ever
shoed
can
go
down
it
indeed
laughed
dick
a
loud
halloo
from
major
mowbray
who
seemed
advancing
upon
the
wings
of
the
wind
told
dick
that
he
was
discovered
the
major
was
a
superb
horseman
and
took
the
lead
of
his
party
striking
his
spurs
deeply
into
his
horse
and
giving
him
bridle
enough
the
major
seemed
to
shoot
forward
like
a
shell
through
the
air
the
burleigh
arms
retired
some
hundred
yards
from
the
road
the
space
in
front
being
occupied
by
a
neat
garden
with
low
clipped
edges
no
tall
timber
intervened
between
dick
and
his
pursuers
so
that
the
motions
of
both
parties
were
visible
to
each
other
dick
saw
in
an
instant
that
if
he
now
started
he
should
come
into
collision
with
the
major
exactly
at
the
angle
of
the
road
and
he
was
by
no
means
desirous
of
hazarding
such
a
rencontre
he
looked
wistfully
back
at
the
double
fence
come
into
the
stable
quick
captain
quick
exclaimed
ralph
the
stable
echoed
dick
hesitating
ay
the
stable
it
your
only
chance
do
you
see
he
turning
the
corner
and
they
are
all
coming
quick
sir
quick
dick
lowering
his
head
rode
into
the
tenement
the
door
of
which
was
unceremoniously
slapped
in
the
major
face
and
bolted
on
the
other
side
villain
cried
major
mowbray
thundering
at
the
door
come
forth
you
are
now
fairly
trapped
at
last
caught
like
the
woodcock
in
your
own
springe
we
have
you
open
the
door
i
say
and
save
us
the
trouble
of
forcing
it
you
can
not
escape
us
we
will
burn
the
building
down
but
we
will
have
you
what
dun
you
want
measter
cried
ralph
from
the
lintel
whence
he
reconnoitered
the
major
and
kept
the
door
fast
you
clean
there
be
none
here
we
soon
see
that
said
paterson
who
had
now
arrived
and
leaping
from
his
horse
the
chief
constable
took
a
short
run
to
give
himself
impetus
and
with
his
foot
burst
open
the
door
this
being
accomplished
in
dashed
the
major
and
paterson
but
the
stable
was
vacant
a
door
was
open
at
the
back
they
rushed
to
it
the
sharply
sloping
sides
of
a
hill
slipped
abruptly
downwards
within
a
yard
of
the
door
it
was
a
perilous
descent
to
the
horseman
yet
the
print
of
a
horse
heels
were
visible
in
the
dislodged
turf
and
scattered
soil
confusion
cried
the
major
he
has
escaped
us
he
is
yonder
said
paterson
pointing
out
turpin
moving
swiftly
through
the
steaming
meadow
see
he
makes
again
for
the
road
he
clears
the
fence
a
regular
throw
he
has
given
us
by
the
lord
nobly
done
by
heaven
cried
the
major
with
all
his
faults
i
honor
the
fellow
courage
and
admire
his
prowess
he
already
ridden
as
i
believe
never
man
rode
before
i
would
not
have
ventured
to
slide
down
that
wall
for
it
nothing
else
with
the
enemy
at
my
heels
what
say
you
gentlemen
have
you
had
enough
shall
we
let
him
go
or
as
far
as
chase
goes
i
do
care
if
we
bring
the
matter
to
a
conclusion
said
titus
i
do
think
as
it
is
that
i
shall
have
a
sate
to
sit
on
this
week
to
come
i
lost
leather
most
confoundedly
what
says
mr
coates
asked
paterson
i
look
to
him
then
mount
and
off
cried
coates
public
duty
requires
that
we
should
take
him
and
private
pique
returned
the
major
no
matter
the
end
is
the
same
justice
shall
be
satisfied
to
your
steeds
my
merry
men
all
hark
and
away
once
more
upon
the
move
titus
forgot
his
distress
and
addressed
himself
to
the
attorney
by
whose
side
he
rode
what
place
is
that
we
coming
to
asked
he
pointing
to
a
cluster
of
moonlit
spires
belonging
to
a
town
they
were
rapidly
approaching
stamford
replied
coates
stamford
exclaimed
titus
by
the
powers
then
we
ridden
a
matter
of
ninety
miles
why
the
great
deeds
of
redmond
were
nothing
to
this
i
remember
it
to
my
dying
day
and
with
reason
added
he
uneasily
shifting
his
position
on
the
saddle
how
fled
what
moonshine
faintly
showed
how
fled
what
darkness
hid
how
fled
the
earth
beneath
their
feet
the
heaven
above
their
head
and
dick
turpin
meanwhile
held
bravely
on
his
course
bess
was
neither
strained
by
her
gliding
passage
down
the
slippery
nor
shaken
by
the
fence
in
the
meadow
as
dick
said
it
took
a
devilish
deal
to
take
it
out
of
her
on
regaining
the
high
road
she
resumed
her
old
pace
and
once
more
they
were
distancing
time
swift
chariot
in
its
whirling
passage
the
earth
stamford
and
the
tongue
of
lincoln
fenny
shire
upon
which
it
is
situated
were
passed
almost
in
a
breath
rutland
is
won
and
passed
and
lincolnshire
once
more
entered
the
road
now
verged
within
a
bowshot
of
that
sporting
athens
corinth
perhaps
we
should
say
melton
mowbray
melton
was
then
unknown
to
fame
but
as
if
inspired
by
that
which
now
inspires
all
who
come
within
twenty
miles
of
this
charybdis
of
the
chase
bess
here
in
a
style
with
which
it
would
have
puzzled
the
best
leicestershire
squire
best
prad
to
have
kept
pace
the
spirit
she
imbibed
through
the
pores
of
her
skin
and
the
juices
of
the
meat
she
had
champed
seemed
to
have
communicated
preternatural
excitement
to
her
her
pace
was
absolutely
terrific
her
eyeballs
were
dilated
and
glowed
like
flaming
carbuncles
while
her
nostril
seemed
in
the
cold
moonshine
to
snort
forth
smoke
as
from
a
hidden
fire
fain
would
turpin
have
controlled
her
but
without
bringing
into
play
all
his
tremendous
nerve
no
check
could
be
given
her
headlong
course
and
for
once
and
the
only
time
in
her
submissive
career
bess
resolved
to
have
her
own
way
and
she
had
it
like
a
sensible
fellow
dick
conceded
the
point
there
was
something
even
of
conjugal
philosophy
in
his
upon
the
occasion
let
her
take
her
own
way
and
be
hanged
to
her
for
an
obstinate
jade
as
she
is
said
he
now
her
back
is
up
there
be
no
stopping
her
i
sure
she
rattles
away
like
a
woman
tongue
and
when
that
once
begins
we
all
know
what
chance
the
curb
has
best
to
let
her
have
it
out
or
rather
to
lend
her
a
lift
be
over
the
sooner
tantivy
lass
tantivy
i
know
which
of
us
will
tire
first
we
have
before
said
that
the
vehement
excitement
of
continued
swift
riding
produces
a
paroxysm
in
the
sensorium
amounting
to
delirium
dick
blood
was
again
on
fire
he
was
first
giddy
as
after
a
deep
draught
of
kindling
spirit
this
passed
off
but
the
spirit
was
still
in
his
veins
the
was
working
in
his
brain
all
his
ardor
his
eagerness
his
fury
returned
he
rode
like
one
insane
and
his
courser
partook
of
his
frenzy
she
bounded
she
leaped
she
tore
up
the
ground
beneath
her
while
dick
gave
vent
to
his
exultation
in
one
wild
prolonged
halloo
more
than
half
his
race
is
run
he
has
triumphed
over
every
difficulty
he
will
have
no
further
occasion
to
halt
bess
carries
her
forage
along
with
her
the
course
is
straightforward
success
seems
certain
the
goal
already
reached
the
path
of
glory
won
another
wild
halloo
to
which
the
echoing
woods
reply
and
away
away
away
thou
matchless
steed
yet
brace
fast
thy
sinews
hold
hold
thy
breath
for
alas
the
goal
is
not
yet
attained
but
forward
forward
on
they
go
high
snorts
the
straining
steed
thick
pants
the
rider
laboring
breath
as
headlong
on
they
speed
see
there
see
there
what
yonder
swings
and
creaks
whistling
rain
gibbet
and
steel
the
accursed
wheel
a
murderer
in
his
chain
and
as
the
eddying
currents
sweep
over
its
plains
in
howling
bleak
december
the
horse
and
her
rider
passed
over
what
remained
of
lincolnshire
grantham
is
gone
and
they
are
now
more
slowly
looking
up
the
ascent
of
gonerby
hill
a
path
well
known
to
turpin
where
often
in
bygone
nights
many
a
purse
had
changed
its
owner
with
that
feeling
of
independence
and
exhilaration
which
every
one
feels
we
believe
on
having
climbed
the
turpin
turned
to
gaze
around
there
was
triumph
in
his
eye
but
the
triumph
was
checked
as
his
glance
fell
upon
a
gibbet
near
him
to
the
right
on
the
round
point
of
hill
which
is
a
landmark
to
the
wide
vale
of
belvoir
pressed
as
he
was
for
time
dick
immediately
struck
out
of
the
road
and
approached
the
spot
where
it
stood
two
scarecrow
objects
covered
with
rags
and
rusty
links
of
chains
depended
from
the
tree
a
night
crow
screaming
around
the
carcases
added
to
the
hideous
effect
of
the
scene
nothing
but
the
living
highwayman
and
his
skeleton
brethren
was
visible
upon
the
solitary
spot
around
him
was
the
lonesome
waste
of
hill
the
moonlit
valley
beneath
his
feet
a
patch
of
bare
and
sod
above
the
wan
declining
moon
and
skies
flaked
with
ghostly
clouds
before
him
the
bleached
bodies
of
the
murderers
for
such
they
were
will
this
be
my
lot
i
marvel
said
dick
looking
upwards
with
an
involuntary
shudder
ay
marry
will
it
rejoined
a
crouching
figure
suddenly
springing
from
beside
a
tuft
of
briars
that
skirted
the
blasted
ground
dick
started
in
his
saddle
while
bess
reared
and
plunged
at
the
sight
of
this
unexpected
apparition
what
ho
thou
devil
dam
barbara
is
it
thou
exclaimed
dick
reassured
upon
discovering
it
was
the
gipsy
queen
and
no
spectre
whom
he
beheld
stand
still
bess
stand
lass
what
dost
thou
here
mother
of
darkness
art
gathering
mandrakes
for
thy
poisonous
messes
or
pilfering
flesh
from
the
dead
meddle
not
with
their
bones
or
i
will
drive
thee
hence
what
dost
thou
here
i
say
old
dam
of
the
gibbet
i
came
to
die
here
replied
barbara
in
a
feeble
tone
and
throwing
back
her
hood
she
displayed
features
as
ghastly
as
those
of
the
skeletons
above
her
indeed
replied
dick
you
made
choice
of
a
pleasant
spot
it
must
be
owned
but
you
not
die
yet
do
you
know
whose
bodies
these
are
asked
barbara
pointing
upwards
two
of
your
race
replied
dick
right
brethren
of
the
blade
two
of
my
sons
returned
barbara
my
twin
children
i
am
come
to
lay
my
bones
beneath
their
bones
my
sepulchre
shall
be
their
sepulchre
my
body
shall
feed
the
fowls
of
the
air
as
theirs
have
fed
them
and
if
ghosts
can
walk
we
scour
this
heath
together
i
tell
you
what
dick
turpin
said
the
hag
drawing
as
near
to
the
highwayman
as
bess
would
permit
her
dead
men
walk
and
ride
ay
there
a
comfort
for
you
i
seen
these
do
it
i
have
seen
them
fling
off
their
chains
and
dance
ay
dance
with
me
with
their
mother
no
revels
like
dead
revels
dick
i
shall
soon
join
you
will
not
lay
violent
hands
upon
yourself
mother
said
dick
with
difficulty
mastering
his
terror
no
replied
barbara
in
an
altered
tone
but
i
will
let
nature
do
her
task
would
she
could
do
it
more
quickly
such
a
life
as
mine
wo
go
out
without
a
long
struggle
what
have
i
to
live
for
now
all
are
gone
she
and
her
child
but
what
is
this
to
you
you
have
no
child
and
if
you
had
you
could
not
feel
like
a
father
no
matter
i
rave
listen
to
me
i
have
crawled
hither
to
die
is
five
days
since
i
beheld
you
and
during
that
time
food
has
not
passed
these
lips
nor
aught
of
moisture
save
heaven
dew
cooled
this
parched
throat
nor
shall
they
to
the
last
that
time
can
not
be
far
off
and
now
can
you
not
guess
i
mean
to
die
begone
and
leave
me
your
presence
troubles
me
i
would
breathe
my
last
breath
alone
with
none
to
witness
the
parting
pang
i
will
not
trouble
you
longer
mother
said
dick
turning
his
mare
nor
will
i
ask
your
blessing
my
blessing
scornfully
ejaculated
barbara
you
shall
have
it
if
you
will
but
you
will
find
it
a
curse
stay
a
thought
strikes
me
whither
are
you
going
to
seek
sir
luke
rookwood
replied
dick
know
you
aught
of
him
sir
luke
rookwood
you
seek
him
and
would
find
him
screamed
barbara
i
would
said
dick
and
you
find
him
said
barbara
and
that
ere
long
i
shall
again
behold
him
would
i
could
i
have
a
message
for
him
one
of
life
and
death
will
you
convey
it
to
him
i
will
said
the
highwayman
swear
by
those
bones
to
do
so
cried
barbara
pointing
with
her
skinny
fingers
to
the
gibbet
that
you
will
do
my
bidding
i
swear
cried
dick
fail
not
or
will
haunt
thee
to
thy
life
end
cried
barbara
adding
as
she
handed
a
sealed
package
to
the
highwayman
give
this
to
sir
luke
to
him
alone
i
would
have
sent
it
to
him
by
other
hands
ere
this
but
my
people
have
deserted
me
have
pillaged
my
stores
have
rifled
me
of
all
save
this
give
this
i
say
to
sir
luke
with
your
own
hands
you
have
sworn
it
and
will
obey
give
it
to
him
and
bid
him
think
of
sybil
as
he
opens
it
but
this
must
not
be
till
eleanor
is
in
his
power
and
she
must
be
present
when
the
seal
is
broken
it
relates
to
both
dare
not
to
tamper
with
it
or
my
curse
shall
pursue
you
that
packet
is
guarded
with
a
triple
spell
which
to
you
were
fatal
obey
me
and
my
dying
breath
shall
bless
thee
never
fear
said
dick
taking
the
packet
i
not
disappoint
you
mother
depend
upon
it
hence
cried
the
crone
and
as
she
watched
dick
figure
lessening
upon
the
waste
and
at
length
beheld
him
finally
disappear
down
the
she
sank
to
the
ground
her
frail
strength
being
entirely
exhausted
body
and
soul
may
now
part
in
peace
gasped
she
all
i
live
for
is
accomplished
and
ere
one
hour
had
elapsed
the
night
crow
was
perched
upon
her
still
breathing
frame
long
pondering
upon
this
singular
interview
dick
pursued
his
way
at
length
he
thought
fit
to
examine
the
packet
with
which
the
old
gipsy
had
entrusted
him
it
feels
like
a
casket
thought
he
it
ca
be
gold
but
then
it
may
be
jewels
though
they
do
rattle
and
it
ai
quite
heavy
enough
what
can
it
be
i
should
like
to
know
there
is
some
mystery
certain
about
it
but
i
will
not
break
the
seal
not
i
as
to
her
spell
that
i
do
value
a
rush
but
i
sworn
to
give
it
to
sir
luke
and
deliver
her
message
and
i
keep
my
word
if
i
can
he
shall
have
it
so
saying
he
replaced
it
in
his
pocket
phantom
i
speak
to
thee
though
hell
itself
should
gape
and
bid
me
hold
my
peace
time
presses
we
may
not
linger
in
our
course
we
must
fly
on
before
our
flying
highwayman
full
forty
miles
shall
we
pass
over
in
a
breath
two
more
hours
have
elapsed
and
he
still
urges
his
headlong
career
with
heart
resolute
as
ever
and
purpose
yet
unchanged
fair
newark
and
the
dashing
trent
most
loved
of
england
streams
are
gathered
to
his
laurels
broad
notts
and
its
heavy
paths
and
sweeping
glades
its
waste
forest
no
more
of
sherwood
past
bold
robin
hood
and
his
merry
men
his
marian
and
his
moonlight
rides
recalled
forgotten
left
behind
hurrah
hurrah
that
wild
halloo
that
waving
arm
that
enlivening
shout
what
means
it
he
is
once
more
upon
yorkshire
ground
his
horse
hoof
beats
once
more
the
soil
of
that
noble
shire
so
transported
was
dick
that
he
could
almost
have
flung
himself
from
the
saddle
to
kiss
the
dust
beneath
his
feet
thrice
fifty
miles
has
he
run
nor
has
the
morn
yet
dawned
upon
his
labors
hurrah
the
end
draws
nigh
the
goal
is
in
view
halloo
halloo
on
bawtrey
is
past
he
takes
the
lower
road
by
thorne
and
selby
he
is
skirting
the
waters
of
the
don
bess
now
began
to
manifest
some
slight
symptoms
of
distress
there
was
a
strain
in
the
carriage
of
her
throat
a
dulness
in
her
eye
a
laxity
in
her
ear
and
a
slight
stagger
in
her
gait
which
turpin
noticed
with
apprehension
still
she
went
on
though
not
at
the
same
gallant
pace
as
heretofore
but
as
the
tired
bird
still
battles
with
the
blast
upon
the
ocean
as
the
swimmer
still
stems
the
stream
though
spent
on
went
she
nor
did
turpin
dare
to
check
her
fearing
that
if
she
stopped
she
might
lose
her
force
or
if
she
fell
she
would
rise
no
more
it
was
now
that
gray
and
grimly
hour
ere
one
flicker
of
orange
or
rose
has
gemmed
the
east
and
when
unwearying
nature
herself
seems
to
snatch
brief
repose
in
the
roar
of
restless
cities
this
is
the
only
time
when
their
strife
is
hushed
midnight
is
awake
alive
the
streets
ring
with
laughter
and
with
rattling
wheels
at
the
third
hour
a
dead
deep
silence
prevails
the
streets
grow
dumb
they
are
deserted
of
all
save
the
few
guardians
of
the
night
and
the
skulking
robber
but
even
far
removed
from
the
haunts
of
men
and
hum
of
towns
it
is
the
same
nature
best
nurse
seems
to
weigh
nature
down
and
stillness
reigns
throughout
our
feelings
are
in
a
great
measure
influenced
by
the
hour
exposed
to
the
raw
crude
atmosphere
which
has
neither
the
nipping
wholesome
shrewdness
of
morn
nor
the
profound
chillness
of
night
the
frame
vainly
struggles
against
the
dull
miserable
sensations
engendered
by
the
damps
and
at
once
communicates
them
to
the
spirits
hope
forsakes
us
we
are
weary
exhausted
our
energy
is
dispirited
sleep
does
not
weigh
our
eyelids
down
we
stare
upon
the
vacancy
we
conjure
up
a
thousand
restless
disheartening
images
we
abandon
projects
we
have
formed
and
which
viewed
through
this
medium
appear
fantastical
chimerical
absurd
we
want
rest
refreshment
energy
we
will
not
say
that
turpin
had
all
these
misgivings
but
he
had
to
struggle
hard
with
himself
to
set
sleep
and
exhaustion
at
defiance
the
moon
had
set
the
stars
pinnacled
deep
in
the
intense
main
had
all
save
one
the
herald
of
the
dawn
withdrawn
their
luster
a
dull
mist
lay
on
the
stream
and
the
air
became
piercing
cold
chilled
fingers
could
scarcely
grasp
the
slackening
rein
while
his
eyes
irritated
by
the
keen
atmosphere
hardly
enabled
him
to
distinguish
surrounding
objects
or
even
to
guide
his
steed
it
was
owing
probably
to
this
latter
circumstance
that
bess
suddenly
floundered
and
fell
throwing
her
master
over
her
head
turpin
instantly
recovered
himself
his
first
thought
was
for
his
horse
but
bess
was
instantly
upon
her
legs
covered
with
dust
and
foam
sides
and
cheeks
and
with
her
large
eyes
glaring
wildly
almost
piteously
upon
her
master
art
hurt
lass
asked
dick
as
she
shook
herself
and
slightly
shivered
and
he
proceeded
to
the
horseman
scrutiny
nothing
but
a
shake
though
that
dull
eye
those
quivering
flanks
added
he
looking
earnestly
at
her
she
wo
go
much
further
and
i
must
give
it
up
what
give
up
the
race
just
when
it
won
no
that
ca
be
ha
well
thought
on
i
a
bottle
of
liquid
given
me
by
an
old
fellow
who
was
a
knowing
cove
and
famous
jockey
in
his
day
which
he
swore
would
make
a
horse
go
as
long
as
he
a
leg
to
carry
him
and
bade
me
keep
it
for
some
great
occasion
i
never
used
it
but
i
try
it
now
it
should
be
in
this
pocket
ah
bess
wench
i
fear
i
using
thee
after
all
as
sir
luke
did
his
mistress
that
i
thought
so
like
thee
no
matter
it
will
be
a
glorious
end
raising
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
dick
poured
the
contents
of
the
bottle
down
the
throat
of
his
mare
nor
had
he
to
wait
long
before
its
invigorating
effects
were
instantaneous
the
fire
was
kindled
in
the
glassy
orb
her
crest
was
once
more
erected
her
flank
ceased
to
quiver
and
she
neighed
loud
and
joyously
egad
the
old
fellow
was
right
cried
dick
the
drink
has
worked
wonders
what
the
devil
could
it
have
been
it
smells
like
spirit
added
he
examining
the
bottle
i
wish
i
left
a
taste
for
myself
but
here
that
will
do
as
well
and
he
drained
his
flask
of
the
last
drop
of
brandy
dick
limbs
were
now
become
so
excessively
stiff
that
it
was
with
difficulty
he
could
remount
his
horse
but
this
necessary
preliminary
being
achieved
by
the
help
of
a
stile
he
found
no
difficulty
in
resuming
his
accustomed
position
upon
the
saddle
we
know
not
whether
there
was
any
likeness
between
our
turpin
and
that
modern
hercules
of
the
sporting
world
osbaldeston
far
be
it
from
us
to
institute
any
comparison
though
we
can
not
help
thinking
that
in
one
particular
he
resembled
that
famous
squire
this
we
will
leave
to
our
reader
discrimination
dick
bore
his
fatigues
wonderfully
he
suffered
somewhat
of
that
martyrdom
which
according
to
tom
moore
occurs
to
weavers
and
from
sitting
too
long
but
again
on
his
courser
back
he
cared
not
for
anything
once
more
at
a
gallant
pace
he
traversed
the
banks
of
the
don
skirting
the
fields
of
flax
that
bound
its
sides
and
hurried
far
more
swiftly
than
its
current
to
its
confluence
with
the
aire
snaith
was
past
he
was
on
the
road
to
selby
when
dawn
first
began
to
break
here
and
there
a
twitter
was
heard
in
the
hedge
a
hare
ran
across
his
path
as
the
morning
self
and
the
mists
began
to
rise
from
the
earth
a
bar
of
gold
was
drawn
against
the
east
like
the
roof
of
a
gorgeous
palace
but
the
mists
were
heavy
in
this
world
of
rivers
and
their
tributary
streams
the
ouse
was
before
him
the
trent
and
aire
behind
the
don
and
derwent
on
either
hand
all
in
their
way
to
commingle
their
currents
ere
they
formed
the
giant
humber
amid
a
region
so
prodigal
of
water
no
wonder
the
dews
fell
thick
as
rain
here
and
there
the
ground
was
clear
but
then
again
came
a
volley
of
vapor
dim
and
palpable
as
smoke
while
involved
in
one
of
these
fogs
turpin
became
aware
of
another
horseman
by
his
side
it
was
impossible
to
discern
the
features
of
the
rider
but
his
figure
in
the
mist
seemed
gigantic
neither
was
the
color
of
his
steed
distinguishable
nothing
was
visible
except
the
outline
of
a
horse
and
his
rider
and
as
the
unknown
rode
upon
the
turf
that
edged
the
way
even
the
sound
of
the
horse
hoofs
was
scarcely
audible
turpin
gazed
not
without
superstitious
awe
once
or
twice
he
essayed
to
address
the
strange
horseman
but
his
tongue
clave
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
he
fancied
he
discovered
in
the
lineaments
of
the
stranger
a
wild
and
fantastic
resemblance
to
his
friend
tom
king
it
must
be
tom
thought
turpin
he
is
come
to
warn
me
of
my
approaching
end
i
will
speak
to
him
but
terror
his
speech
he
could
not
force
out
a
word
and
thus
side
by
side
they
rode
in
silence
quaking
with
fears
he
would
scarcely
acknowledge
to
himself
dick
watched
every
motion
of
his
companion
he
was
still
stern
erect
and
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
demon
on
his
phantom
steed
his
courser
seemed
in
the
indistinct
outline
to
be
huge
and
bony
and
as
he
snorted
furiously
in
the
fog
dick
heated
imagination
supplied
his
breath
with
a
due
proportion
of
flame
not
a
word
was
spoken
not
a
sound
heard
save
the
sullen
dead
beat
of
his
hoofs
upon
the
grass
it
was
intolerable
to
ride
thus
cheek
by
jowl
with
a
goblin
dick
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
put
spurs
to
his
horse
and
endeavored
to
escape
but
it
might
not
be
the
stranger
apparently
without
effort
was
still
by
his
side
and
feet
in
her
master
apprehensions
were
nailed
to
the
ground
however
the
atmosphere
became
clearer
bright
quivering
beams
burst
through
the
vaporous
shroud
and
then
it
was
that
dick
discovered
that
the
apparition
of
tom
king
was
no
other
than
luke
rookwood
he
was
mounted
on
his
old
horse
rook
and
looked
grim
and
haggard
as
a
ghost
vanishing
at
the
crowing
of
the
cock
sir
luke
rookwood
by
this
light
exclaimed
dick
in
astonishment
why
i
took
you
for
the
devil
no
doubt
returned
luke
smiling
sternly
and
were
sorry
to
find
yourself
so
hard
pressed
do
disquiet
yourself
i
am
still
flesh
and
blood
had
i
taken
you
for
one
of
mortal
mould
said
dick
you
should
have
soon
seen
where
i
have
put
you
in
the
race
that
confounded
fog
deceived
me
and
bess
acted
the
fool
as
well
as
myself
however
now
i
know
you
sir
luke
you
must
spur
alongside
for
the
hawks
are
on
the
wing
and
though
i
much
to
say
i
not
a
second
to
lose
and
dick
briefly
detailed
the
particulars
of
his
ride
concluding
with
his
rencontre
with
barbara
here
the
packet
said
he
just
as
i
got
it
you
must
keep
it
till
the
proper
moment
and
here
added
he
fumbling
in
his
pocket
for
another
paper
is
the
marriage
document
you
are
now
your
father
lawful
son
let
who
will
say

you
are
ever
master
of
miss
mowbray
hand

not
forget

luke
eagerly
grasping
the
certificate
but
she
never

be
mine
you
have
her
oath
i
have
what
more
is
needed
her
hand

wildly

my
affianced
bride
affianced
before
hell
if
not
before
heaven
i
have
sealed
the
contract

sybil
blood
and
it
shall
be
fulfilled
i
have
her
oath
her
oath
ha
ha
though
i
perish
in
the
attempt
i
will
wrest
her
from
ranulph
grasp
she
shall
never

his
i
would
stab
her
first
twice
have
i
failed
in
my
endeavors
to
bear
her
off
i
am
from
rookwood
even
now
night
i
shall
renew
the
attack
will
you
assist
me
night
interrupted
dick
nay
i
should
say
a
new
day
has
already
dawned
replied
luke
i
will
she
is
at
rookwood
she
languishes
there
at
present
attended
by
her
mother
and
her
lover
the
hall
is
watched
and
guarded
ranulph
is
ever
on
the
alert
but
we
will
storm
their
garrison
i
have
a
spy
within
its
walls
a
gipsy
girl
faithful
to
my
interests
from
her
i
have
learnt
that
there
is
a
plot
to
wed
eleanor
to
ranulph
and
that
the
marriage
is
to
take
place
privately
this
must
be
prevented
it
must
but
why
not
boldly
appear
in
person
at
the
hall
and
claim
her
why
not
i
am
a
proscribed
felon
a
price
is
set
upon
my
head
i
am
hunted
through
the
country
driven
to
concealment
and
dare
not
show
myself
for
fear
of
capture
what
could
i
do
now
they
would
load
me
with
fetters
bury
me
in
a
dungeon
and
wed
eleanor
to
ranulph
what
would
my
rights
avail
what
would
her
oath
signify
to
them
no
she
must
be
mine
by
force
she
shall
never
be
again
i
ask
you
will

the
hut

thorne
waste

it

was
one
of
your
haunts

dick
and
conkey
jem
its
keeper
into
the
bargain
he
is
a
knowing
file
i
join
you
at
the
hut
at
midnight
if

we

spite

the
thing

but
in
case
of
a
on
my
part
suppose
you
take
charge
of
my
purse
in
the
mean
time
luke
would
have
declined
this
offer
pshaw
said
dick
who
knows
what
may
happen
and
it
not
either
you
find
an
odd
hundred
or
so
in
that
silken
bag
it
not
often

highwayman

purse

we

the
trick

hut

snug
there
till
midnight
and
we
ride
over
to
rookwood
at
midnight
replied
sir
luke
wheeling
off
i
shall
expect
you
hawks
hallooed
dick
but
luke
had
vanished
in
another
instant
dick
was
scouring
the
plain
as
rapidly
as
ever
in
the
mean
time
as
dick
has
casually
alluded
to
the
hawks
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
inquire
how
they
had
flown
throughout
the
night
and
whether
they
were
still
in
chase
of
their
quarry
with
the
exception
of
titus
who
was
completely
done
up
at
grantham
having
got
as
he
said
a
complete
bellyful
of
it
they
were
still
on
the
wing
and
resolved
sooner
or
later
to
pounce
upon
their
prey
pursuing
the
same
system
as
heretofore
in
regard
to
the
major
mowbray
and
paterson
took
the
lead
but
the
irascible
and
invincible
attorney
was
not
far
in
their
rear
his
wrath
having
been
by
no
means
allayed
by
the
fatigue
he
had
undergone
at
bawtrey
they
held
a
council
of
war
for
a
few
minutes
being
doubtful
which
course
he
had
taken
their
incertitude
was
relieved
by
a
foot
traveller
who
had
heard
dick
loud
halloo
on
passing
the
boundary
of
nottinghamshire
and
had
seen
him
take
the
lower
road
they
struck
therefore
into
the
path
at
thorne
at
a
hazard
and
were
soon
satisfied
they
were
right
furiously
did
they
now
spur
on
they
reached
selby
changed
horses
at
the
inn
in
front
of
the
venerable
cathedral
church
and
learnt
from
the
postboy
that
a
toilworn
horseman
on
a
jaded
steed
had
ridden
through
the
town
about
five
minutes
before
them
and
could
not
be
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
advance
his
horse
was
so
dead
beat
said
the
lad
that
sure
he
can
not
have
got
far
and
if
you
look
sharp
i
be
bound
you
overtake
him
before
he
reaches
cawood
ferry
coates
was
transported
we
lodge
him
snug
in
york
castle
before
an
hour
paterson
cried
he
rubbing
his
hands
i
hope
so
sir
said
the
chief
constable
but
i
begin
to
have
some
qualms
now
gentlemen
shouted
the
postboy
come
along
i
soon
bring
you
to
him
the
sight
renewed
my
courser
feet
a
moment
staggering
feebly
fleet
a
moment
with
a
faint
low
neigh
he
answered
and
then
fell
with
gasps
and
glazing
eyes
he
lay
and
reeking
limbs
immovable
his
first
and
last
career
was
done
the
sun
had
just
the
high
eastern
hill
as
turpin
reached
the
ferry
of
cawood
and
his
beams
were
reflected
upon
the
deep
and
sluggish
waters
of
the
ouse
wearily
had
he
dragged
his
course
thither
wearily
and
slow
the
powers
of
his
gallant
steed
were
spent
and
he
could
scarcely
keep
her
from
sinking
it
was
now
midway
the
hours
of
five
and
six
nine
miles
only
lay
before
him
and
that
thought
again
revived
him
he
reached
the
water
edge
and
hailed
the
ferryboat
which
was
then
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
at
that
instant
a
loud
shout
smote
his
ear
it
was
the
halloo
of
his
pursuers
despair
was
in
his
look
he
shouted
to
the
boatman
and
bade
him
pull
fast
the
man
obeyed
but
he
had
to
breast
a
strong
stream
and
had
a
lazy
bark
and
heavy
sculls
to
contend
with
he
had
scarcely
left
the
shore
when
another
shout
was
raised
from
the
pursuers
the
tramp
of
their
steeds
grew
louder
and
louder
the
boat
had
scarcely
reached
the
middle
of
the
stream
his
captors
were
at
hand
quietly
did
he
walk
down
the
bank
and
as
cautiously
enter
the
water
there
was
a
plunge
and
steed
and
rider
were
swimming
down
the
river
major
mowbray
was
at
the
brink
of
the
stream
he
hesitated
an
instant
and
stemmed
the
tide
seized
as
it
were
by
a
mania
for
equestrian
distinction
coates
braved
the
torrent
not
so
paterson
he
very
coolly
took
out
his
bulldogs
and
watching
turpin
cast
up
in
his
own
mind
the
and
of
shooting
him
as
he
was
crossing
i
could
certainly
hit
him
thought
or
said
the
constable
but
what
of
that
a
dead
highwayman
is
worth
nothing
alive
he
i
shoot
him
but
i
make
a
pretence
and
he
fired
accordingly
the
shot
skimmed
over
the
water
but
did
not
as
it
was
intended
do
much
mischief
it
however
occasioned
a
mishap
which
had
nearly
proved
fatal
to
our
aquatic
attorney
alarmed
at
the
report
of
the
pistol
in
the
nervous
agitation
of
the
moment
coates
drew
in
his
rein
so
tightly
that
his
steed
instantly
sank
a
moment
or
two
afterwards
he
rose
shaking
his
ears
and
floundering
heavily
towards
the
shore
and
such
was
the
chilling
effect
of
this
sudden
immersion
that
coates
now
thought
much
more
of
saving
himself
than
of
capturing
turpin
dick
meanwhile
had
reached
the
opposite
bank
and
refreshed
by
her
bath
bess
scrambled
up
the
sides
of
the
stream
and
speedily
regained
the
road
i
shall
do
it
yet
shouted
dick
that
stream
has
saved
her
hark
away
lass
hark
away
bess
heard
the
cheering
cry
and
she
answered
to
the
call
she
roused
all
her
energies
strained
every
sinew
and
put
forth
all
her
remaining
strength
once
more
on
wings
of
swiftness
she
bore
him
away
from
his
pursuers
and
major
mowbray
who
had
now
gained
the
shore
and
made
certain
of
securing
him
beheld
him
spring
like
a
wounded
hare
from
beneath
his
very
hand
it
can
not
hold
out
said
the
major
it
is
but
an
expiring
flash
that
gallant
steed
must
soon
drop
she
be
regularly
booked
that
certain
said
the
postboy
we
shall
find
her
on
the
road
contrary
to
all
expectation
however
bess
held
on
and
set
pursuit
at
defiance
her
pace
was
swift
as
when
she
started
but
it
was
unconscious
and
mechanical
action
it
wanted
the
ease
the
lightness
the
life
of
her
former
riding
she
seemed
screwed
up
to
a
task
which
she
must
execute
there
was
no
flogging
no
gory
heel
but
the
heart
was
throbbing
tugging
at
the
sides
within
her
spirit
spurred
her
onwards
her
eye
was
glazing
her
chest
heaving
her
flank
quivering
her
crest
again
fallen
yet
she
held
on
she
is
dying
said
dick
i
feel
it
no
she
held
on
fulford
is
past
the
towers
and
pinnacles
of
york
burst
upon
him
in
all
the
freshness
the
beauty
and
the
glory
of
a
bright
clear
autumnal
morn
the
ancient
city
seemed
to
smile
a
welcome
a
greeting
the
noble
minster
and
its
serene
and
massive
pinnacles
crocketed
and
beautiful
mary
lofty
spire
tower
the
massive
mouldering
walls
of
the
adjacent
postern
the
grim
castle
and
clifford
neighboring
keep
all
beamed
upon
him
like
a
face
that
laughs
out
openly
it
is
done
it
is
won
cried
dick
hurrah
hurrah
and
the
sunny
air
was
cleft
with
his
shouts
bess
was
not
insensible
to
her
master
exultation
she
neighed
feebly
in
answer
to
his
call
and
reeled
forwards
it
was
a
piteous
sight
to
see
her
to
mark
her
staring
protruding
eyeball
her
shaking
flanks
but
while
life
and
limb
held
together
she
held
on
another
mile
is
past
york
is
near
hurrah
shouted
dick
but
his
voice
was
hushed
bess
tottered
fell
there
was
a
dreadful
gasp
a
parting
moan
a
snort
her
eye
gazed
for
an
instant
upon
her
master
with
a
dying
glare
then
grew
glassy
rayless
fixed
a
shiver
ran
through
her
frame
her
heart
had
burst
dick
eyes
were
blinded
as
with
rain
his
triumph
though
achieved
was
forgotten
his
own
safety
was
disregarded
he
stood
weeping
and
swearing
like
one
beside
himself
and
art
thou
gone
bess
cried
he
in
a
voice
of
agony
lifting
up
his
courser
head
and
kissing
her
lips
covered
with
foam
gone
gone
and
i
have
killed
the
best
steed
that
was
ever
crossed
and
for
what
added
dick
beating
his
brow
with
his
clenched
hand
for
what
for
what
at
this
moment
the
deep
bell
of
the
minster
clock
tolled
out
the
hour
of
six
i
am
answered
gasped
dick
was
to
hear
those
turpin
was
roused
from
the
state
of
stupefaction
into
which
he
had
fallen
by
a
smart
slap
on
the
shoulder
recalled
to
himself
by
the
blow
he
started
at
once
to
his
feet
while
his
hands
sought
his
pistols
but
he
was
spared
the
necessity
of
using
them
by
discovering
in
the
intruder
the
bearded
visage
of
the
gipsy
balthazar
the
patrico
was
habited
in
mendicant
weeds
and
sustained
a
large
wallet
upon
his
shoulders
so
it
all
over
with
the
best
mare
in
england
i
see
said
balthazar
i
can
guess
how
it
has
happened
you
are
pursued
i
am
said
dick
roughly
your
pursuers
are
at
hand
within
a
few
hundred
yards
then
why
stay
here
fly
while
you
can
never
never
cried
turpin
i
fight
it
out
here
by
bess
side
poor
lass
i
killed
her
but
she
has
done
it
ha
ha
we
have
won
what
and
his
utterance
was
again
choked
hark
i
hear
the
tramp
of
horse
and
shouts
cried
the
patrico
take
this
wallet
you
will
find
a
change
of
dress
within
it
dart
into
that
thick
copse
save
yourself
but
bess
i
can
not
leave
her
exclaimed
dick
with
an
agonizing
look
at
his
horse
and
what
did

true
said
dick
but
take
care
of
her

let
those

meddle
with
her

cried
the
patrico
leave
bess
to
me
possessing
himself
of
the
wallet
dick
disappeared
in
the
adjoining
copse
he
had
not
been
gone
many
seconds
when
major
mowbray
rode
up
who
is
this
exclaimed
the
major
flinging
himself
from
his
horse
and
seizing
the
patrico
this
is
not
turpin
certainly
not
replied
balthazar
coolly
i
am
not
exactly
the
figure
for
a
highwayman
where
is
he
what
has
become
of
him
asked
coates
in
despair
as
he
and
paterson
joined
the
major
escaped
i
fear
replied
the
major
have
you
seen
any
one
fellow
added
he
addressing
the
patrico
i
have
seen
no
one
replied
balthazar
i
am
only
this
instant
arrived
this
dead
horse
lying
in
the
road
attracted
my
attention
ha
exclaimed
paterson
leaping
from
his
steed
this
may
be
turpin
after
all
he
has
as
many
disguises
as
the
devil
himself
and
may
have
carried
that
goat
hair
in
his
pocket
saying
which
he
seized
the
patrico
by
the
beard
and
shook
it
with
as
little
reverence
as
the
gaul
handled
the
hirsute
chin
of
the
roman
senator
the
devil
hands
off
roared
balthazar
by
salamon
i
wo
stand
such
usage
do
you
think
a
beard
like
mine
is
the
growth
of
a
few
minutes
hands
off
i
say
regularly
done
said
paterson
removing
his
hold
of
the
chin
and
looking
as
blank
as
a
cartridge
ay
exclaimed
coates
all
owing
to
this
worthless
piece
of
carrion
if
it
were
not
that
i
hope
to
see
him
dangling
from
those
walls
pointing
towards
the
castle
i
should
wish
her
master
were
by
her
side
now
to
the
dogs
with
her
and
he
was
about
to
spurn
the
breathless
carcase
of
poor
bess
when
a
sudden
blow
dealt
by
the
patrico
staff
felled
him
to
the
ground
i
teach
you
to
molest
me
said
balthazar
about
to
attack
paterson
come
come
said
the
discomfited
chief
constable
no
more
of
this
it
plain
we
in
the
wrong
box
every
bone
in
my
body
aches
sufficiently
without
the
aid
of
your
cudgel
old
fellow
come
coates
take
my
arm
and
let
be
moving
we
had
an
infernal
long
ride
for
nothing
not
so
replied
coates
i
paid
pretty
dearly
for
it
however
let
us
see
if
we
can
get
any
breakfast
at
the
yonder
though
i
already
had
my
morning
draught
added
the
facetious
man
of
law
looking
at
his
dripping
apparel
poor
black

said
major
mowbray
wistfully
regarding
the
body
of
the
mare
as
it
lay
stretched
at
his
feet
thou
deservedst
a
better
fate
and
a
better
master
in
thee
dick
turpin
has
lost
his
best
friend
his
exploits
will
henceforth
want
the
coloring
of
romance
which
thy
unfailing
energies
threw
over
them
light
lie
the
ground
over
thee
thou
matchless
mare
to
the
the
party
proceeded
leaving
the
patrico
in
undisturbed
possession
of
the
lifeless
body
of
black
bess
major
mowbray
ordered
a
substantial
repast
to
be
prepared
with
all
possible
expedition
a
countryman
in
a
was
busily
engaged
at
his
meal
to
see
that
fellow
bolt
down
his
breakfast
one
would
think
he
had
fasted
for
a
month
said
coates
see
the
wholesome
effects
of
an
honest
industrious
life
paterson
i
envy
him
his
appetite
i
should
fall
to
with
more
zest
were
dick
turpin
in
his
place
the
countryman
looked
up
he
was
an
fellow
with
a
terrible
squint
and
a
strange
contorted
countenance
an
ugly
dog
exclaimed
paterson
what
a
devil
of
a
twist
he
has
got
what
that
you
says
about
dick
taarpin
measter
asked
the
countryman
with
his
mouth
half
full
of
bread
have
you
seen
aught
of
him
asked
coates
not
i
mumbled
the
rustic
but
i
hears
aw
the
folks
hereabouts
talk
on
him
they
say
as
how
he
sets
all
the
lawyers
and
constables
at
defiance
and
laughs
in
his
sleeve
at
their
efforts
to
cotch
him
ha
ha
he
gets
over
more
ground
in
a
day
than
they
do
in
a
week
ho
ho
that
all
over
now
said
coates
peevishly
he
has
cut
his
own
throat
ridden
his
famous
mare
to
death
the
countryman
almost
choked
himself
in
the
attempt
to
bolt
a
huge
mouthful
ay
indeed
measter
how
happened
that
asked
he
so
soon
as
he
recovered
speech
the
fool
rode
her
from
london
to
york
last
night
returned
coates
such
a
feat
was
never
performed
before
what
horse
could
be
expected
to
live
through
such
work
as
that
ah
he
were
a
foo
to
attempt
that
observed
the
countryman
but
you
followed
belike
we
did
and
took
him
arter
all
i
reckon
asked
the
rustic
squinting
more
horribly
than
ever
no
returned
coates
i
ca
say
we
did
but
we
have
him
yet
pretty
sure
he
ca
be
far
off
we
may
be
nearer
him
than
we
imagine
may
be
so
measter
returned
the
countryman
but
might
i
be
so
bold
as
to
ax
how
many
horses
you
used
i
the
chase
some
maybe
half
a
dozen
growled
paterson
we
had
twenty
at
the
least
and
i
one
mentally
ejaculated
turpin
for
he
was
the
countryman
it
was
an
ill
oath
better
broke
than
kept
the
laws
of
nature
and
of
nations
do
dispense
with
matters
of
divinity
in
such
a
case
tateham
hut
on
thorne
are
all
our
horses
and
our
arms
in
safety
they
feed
like
pluto
palfreys
under
ground
our
pistols
swords
and
other
furniture
are
safely
locked
up
at
our
rendezvous
of
prigs
the
hut
on
thorne
waste
to
which
we
have
before
incidentally
alluded
and
whither
we
are
now
about
to
repair
was
a
low
lone
hovel
situate
on
the
banks
of
the
deep
and
oozy
don
at
the
eastern
extremity
of
that
extensive
moor
ostensibly
its
owner
fulfilled
the
duties
of
ferryman
to
that
part
of
the
river
but
as
the
road
which
skirted
his
tenement
was
little
frequented
his
craft
was
for
the
most
part
allowed
to
sleep
undisturbed
in
her
moorings
in
reality
however
he
was
the
inland
agent
of
a
horde
of
smugglers
who
infested
the
neighboring
coast
his
cabin
was
their
rendezvous
and
not
unfrequently
it
was
said
the
depository
of
their
contraband
goods
conkey
jem
so
was
he
called
by
his
associates
on
account
of
the
slawkenbergian
promontory
which
decorated
his
countenance
had
been
an
old
hand
at
the
same
trade
but
having
returned
from
a
seven
leave
of
absence
from
his
own
country
procured
by
his
lawless
life
now
managed
matters
with
more
circumspection
and
prudence
and
had
never
since
been
detected
in
his
former
illicit
traffic
nor
though
so
marvellously
gifted
in
that
particular
himself
was
he
ever
known
to
upon
any
of
his
accomplices
or
in
other
words
to
betray
them
on
the
contrary
his
hut
was
a
sort
of
asylum
for
all
fugitives
from
justice
and
although
the
sanctity
of
his
walls
would
in
all
probability
have
been
little
regarded
had
any
one
been
detected
within
them
yet
strange
to
say
even
if
a
robber
had
been
tracked
as
it
often
chanced
to
jem
immediate
neighborhood
all
traces
of
him
were
sure
to
be
lost
at
the
ferryman
hut
and
further
search
was
useless
within
the
hut
presented
such
an
appearance
as
might
be
expected
from
its
owner
pursuits
and
its
own
unpromising
exterior
consisting
of
little
more
than
a
couple
of
rooms
the
rude
whitewashed
walls
exhibited
in
lieu
of
prints
of
more
pretension
a
gallery
of
ballads
celebrating
the
exploits
of
various
highwaymen
renowned
in
song
amongst
which
our
friend
dick
turpin
figured
conspicuously
upon
his
sable
steed
bess
being
represented
by
a
huge
rampant
black
patch
and
dick
with
a
pistol
considerably
longer
than
the
arm
that
sustained
it
next
to
this
curious
collection
was
a
a
a
an
and
other
piscatorial
apparatus
with
a
couple
of
sculls
and
a
indicative
of
jem
ferryman
office
suspended
by
various
hooks
the
whole
blackened
and
begrimed
by
there
being
no
legitimate
means
of
permitted
to
the
vapor
generated
by
the
hearthstone
the
only
window
indeed
in
the
hut
was
to
the
front
the
back
apartment
which
served
jem
for
dormitory
had
no
aperture
whatever
for
the
admission
of
light
except
such
as
was
afforded
through
the
door
of
communication
between
the
rooms
a
few
broken
chairs
with
a
couple
of
dirty
tables
formed
the
sum
total
of
the
furniture
notwithstanding
the
grotesque
effect
of
his
exaggerated
nasal
organ
jem
aspect
was
at
once
savage
and
repulsive
his
lank
black
hair
hung
about
his
inflamed
visage
in
wild
elf
locks
the
animal
predominating
throughout
his
eyes
were
small
red
and
wolfish
and
glared
suspiciously
from
beneath
his
scarred
and
tufted
eyebrows
while
certain
of
his
teeth
projected
like
the
tusks
of
a
boar
from
out
his
sensual
mouth
dwarfish
in
stature
and
deformed
in
person
jem
was
built
for
strength
and
what
with
his
width
of
shoulder
and
shortness
of
neck
his
figure
looked
as
square
and
as
solid
as
a
cube
his
throat
and
hirsute
chest
constantly
exposed
to
the
weather
had
acquired
a
glowing
tan
while
his
arms
uncovered
to
the
shoulders
and
clothed
with
fur
like
a
bear
hide
down
almost
to
the
tips
of
his
fingers
presented
a
knot
of
folded
muscles
the
concentrated
force
of
which
few
would
have
desired
to
encounter
in
action
it
was
now
on
the
stroke
of
midnight
and
jem
who
had
been
lying
extended
upon
the
floor
of
his
hovel
suddenly
aroused
by
that
warning
impulse
which
never
fails
to
awaken
one
of
his
calling
at
the
exact
moment
when
they
require
to
be
upon
the
alert
now
set
about
fanning
into
flame
the
expiring
fuel
upon
his
hearth
having
succeeded
in
igniting
further
portions
of
the
turf
jem
proceeded
to
examine
the
security
of
his
door
and
window
and
satisfied
that
lock
and
bolt
were
shot
and
that
the
shutter
was
carefully
closed
he
kindled
a
light
at
his
fire
and
walked
towards
his
bedroom
but
it
was
not
to
retire
for
the
night
that
the
ferryman
entered
his
dormitory
beside
his
crazy
couch
stood
a
litter
of
empty
bottles
and
a
beer
cask
crowding
the
chamber
the
latter
he
rolled
aside
and
pressing
his
foot
upon
the
plank
beneath
it
the
board
gave
way
and
a
opening
discovered
a
ladder
conducting
apparently
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
jem
leaned
over
the
abyss
and
called
in
hoarse
accents
to
some
one
below
an
answer
was
immediately
returned
and
a
light
became
soon
afterwards
visible
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
two
figures
next
ascended
the
first
who
set
foot
within
the
ferryman
chamber
was
alan
rookwood
the
other
as
the
reader
may
perhaps
conjecture
was
his
grandson
is
it
the
hour
asked
luke
as
he
sprang
from
out
the
ay
replied
jem
with
a
coarse
laugh
or
i
had
not
disturbed
myself
to
call
you
but
maybe
added
he
softening
his
manner
a
little
you
like
some
refreshments
before
you
start
a
stoup
of
nantz
will
put
you
in
cue
for
the
job
ha
ha
not
i
replied
luke
who
could
ill
tolerate
his
familiarity
give
me
to
drink
said
alan
walking
feebly
towards
the
fire
and
extending
his
skinny
fingers
before
it
i
am
chilled
by
the
damps
of
that
swampy
cave
the
natural
heat
within
me
is
nigh
extinguished
here
is
that
shall
put
fresh
marrow
into
your
old
bones
returned
jem
handing
him
a
tumbler
of
brandy
never
stint
it
i
be
sworn
be
the
better
o
for
you
look
desperate
queer
man
about
the
mazard
alan
was
in
sooth
a
ghastly
spectacle
the
events
of
the
last
few
days
had
wrought
a
fearful
change
his
countenance
was
almost
exanimate
and
when
with
shaking
hand
and
trembling
lips
he
had
drained
the
fiery
potion
to
the
dregs
a
terrible
grimace
was
excited
upon
his
features
such
as
is
produced
upon
the
corpse
by
the
action
of
the
galvanic
machine
even
jem
regarded
him
with
a
sort
of
apprehension
after
he
had
taken
breath
for
a
moment
alan
broke
out
into
a
fit
of
wild
and
immoderate
laughter
why
ay
said
he
this
is
indeed
to
grow
young
again
and
to
feel
fresh
fire
within
one
veins
who
would
have
thought
so
much
of
life
and
energy
could
reside
in
this
little
vessel
i
am
myself
once
more
and
not
the
same
soulless
pulseless
lump
of
clay
i
was
a
moment
or
two
back
the
damps
of
that
den
had
destroyed
me
and
the
solitude
the
i
had
the
visions
horrible
i
will
not
think
of
them
i
am
better
now
ready
to
execute
my
plans
plans
i
should
say
grandson
luke
are
our
horses
in
readiness
why
do
we
tarry
the
hour
is
arrived
and
i
would
not
that
my
courage
should
evaporate
ere
the
great
work
for
which
i
live
be
accomplished
that
done
i
ask
no
further
stimulant
let
us
away
we
tarry
but
for
turpin
said
luke
i
am
as
impatient
as
yourself
i
fear
some
mischance
must
have
befallen
him
or
he
would
have
been
true
to
his
appointment
do
you
not
think
so
he
added
addressing
the
ferryman
why
replied
jem
reluctantly
since
you
put
it
home
to
me
and
i
ca
conceal
it
no
longer
i
tell
you
what
i
did
tell
afore
for
fear
you
should
be
down
in
the
mouth
about
it
dick
turpin
can
do
nothing
for
you
he
grabb
turpin
apprehended
ejaculated
luke
ay
returned
jem
i
learnt
from
a
farmer
who
crossed
the
ferry
at
nightfall
that
he
were
grabb
this
morning
at
york
after
having
ridden
his
famous
prad
to
death
that
what
hurts
me
more
not
all
the
rest
though
i
fear
dick
will
scarce
cheat
the
nubbing
cheat
this
go
his
time
up
i
calculate
will
you
supply
his
place
and
accompany
us
asked
luke
of
the
ferryman
no
no
replied
jem
shaking
his
head
there
too
much
risk
and
too
little
profit
in
the
business
for
me
it
wo
pay
and
what
might
tempt
you
to
undertake
the
enterprise
asked
alan
more
than
you
have
to
offer
master
peter
replied
jem
who
had
not
been
enlightened
upon
the
subject
of
alan
real
name
or
condition
how
know
you
that
demanded
alan
name
your
demand
well
then
i
not
say
but
a
hundred
pounds
if
you
had
it
might
bribe
me
to
part
with
your
soul
to
the
devil
i
doubt
not
said
luke
fiercely
stamping
the
ground
let
us
be
gone
we
need
not
his
mercenary
aid
we
will
do
without
him
stay
said
alan
you
shall
have
the
hundred
provided
you
will
assure
us
of
your
services
cut
no
more
blarneyfied
whids
master
sexton
replied
jem
in
a
gruff
tone
if
i
to
go
i
must
have
the
chink
down
and
that
more
nor
either
of
you
can
do
i
thinking
give
me
your
purse
whispered
alan
to
his
grandson
pshaw
continued
he
do
you
hesitate
this
man
can
do
much
for
us
think
upon
eleanor
and
be
prudent
you
can
not
accomplish
your
task
unaided
taking
the
amount
from
the
purse
he
gave
it
to
the
ferryman
adding
if
we
succeed
the
sum
shall
be
doubled
and
now
let
us
set
out
during
alan
speech
jem
sharp
eyes
had
been
fastened
upon
the
purse
while
he
mechanically
clutched
the
which
were
given
to
him
he
could
not
remove
his
gaze
but
continued
staring
at
the
treasure
before
him
as
if
he
would
willingly
by
force
have
made
it
all
his
own
alan
saw
the
error
he
had
committed
in
exposing
the
contents
of
the
purse
to
the
avaricious
ferryman
and
was
about
to
restore
it
to
luke
when
the
bag
was
suddenly
snatched
from
his
grasp
and
himself
levelled
by
a
blow
upon
the
floor
conkey
jem
found
the
temptation
irresistible
knowing
himself
to
be
a
match
for
both
his
companions
and
imagining
he
was
secure
from
interruption
he
conceived
the
idea
of
making
away
with
them
and
possessing
himself
of
their
wealth
no
sooner
had
he
disposed
of
alan
than
he
assailed
luke
who
met
his
charge
half
way
with
the
vigor
and
alacrity
of
the
latter
the
reader
is
already
acquainted
but
he
was
no
match
for
the
herculean
strength
of
the
ferryman
who
with
the
ferocity
of
the
boar
he
so
much
resembled
thus
furiously
attacked
him
nevertheless
as
may
be
imagined
he
was
not
disposed
to
yield
up
his
life
tamely
he
saw
at
once
the
murderous
intentions
and
well
aware
of
his
prodigious
power
would
not
have
risked
a
close
struggle
could
he
have
avoided
it
snatching
the
from
the
wall
he
had
hurled
it
at
the
head
of
his
adversary
but
without
effect
in
the
next
instant
he
was
locked
in
a
clasp
terrible
as
that
of
a
polar
bear
in
spite
of
all
his
struggles
luke
was
speedily
hurled
to
the
ground
and
jem
who
had
thrown
himself
upon
him
was
apparently
searching
about
for
some
weapon
to
put
a
bloody
termination
to
the
conflict
when
the
trampling
of
a
horse
was
heard
at
the
door
three
taps
were
repeated
slowly
one
after
the
other
and
a
call
resounded
from
a
whistle
damnation
ejaculated
jem
gruffly
interrupted
and
he
seemed
irresolute
slightly
altering
his
position
on
luke
body
the
moment
was
fortunate
for
luke
and
in
all
probability
saved
his
life
he
extricated
himself
from
the
ferryman
grasp
regained
his
feet
and
what
was
of
more
importance
the
weapon
he
had
thrown
away
villain
cried
he
about
to
plunge
the
spear
with
all
his
force
into
his
enemy
side
you
shall
the
whistle
was
again
heard
without
do
you
hear
that
cried
jem
is
turpin
call
turpin
echoed
luke
dropping
the
point
of
his
weapon
unbar
the
door
you
treacherous
rascal
and
admit
him
well
say
no
more
about
it
sir
luke
said
jem
fawningly
i
knows
i
owes
you
my
life
and
i
thank
you
for
it
take
back
the
lowre
he
should
not
have
shown
it
me
it
was
that
as
did
all
the
mischief
unbar
the
door
and
parley
not
said
luke
contemptuously
jem
complied
with
pretended
alacrity
but
real
reluctance
casting
suspicious
glances
at
luke
as
he
withdrew
the
bolts
the
door
at
length
being
opened
haggard
exhausted
and
covered
with
dust
dick
turpin
staggered
into
the
hut
well
i
am
here
said
he
with
a
hollow
laugh
i
kept
my
word
ha
ha
i
been
damnably
put
to
it
but
here
i
am
ha
ha
and
he
sank
upon
one
of
the
stools
we
heard
you
were
apprehended
said
luke
i
am
glad
to
find
the
information
was
false
added
he
glancing
angrily
at
the
ferryman
whoever
told
you
that
told
you
a
lie
sir
luke
replied
dick
but
what
are
you
scowling
at
old
charon
and
you
sir
luke
why
do
you
glower
at
each
other
make
fast
the
door
bolt
it
cerberus
right
now
give
me
a
glass
of
brandy
and
then
i
talk
a
bumper
so
another
what
that
i
see
a
dead
man
old
peter
alan
i
mean
has
anything
happened
to
him
that
he
has
taken
his
measure
there
so
quietly
nothing
i
trust
said
luke
stooping
to
raise
up
his
grandsire
the
blow
has
stunned
him
the
blow
repeated
turpin
what
there
been
a
quarrel
then
i
thought
as
much
from
your
amiable
looks
at
each
other
come
come
we
must
have
no
differences
give
the
old
earthworm
a
taste
of
this
engage
it
will
bring
him
to
fast
enough
ay
rub
his
temples
with
it
if
you
rather
but
it
a
better
remedy
down
the
gullet
the
natural
course
and
hark
ye
jem
search
your
crib
quickly
and
see
if
you
have
any
within
it
and
any
more
in
the
cellar
i
as
hungry
as
a
hunter
and
as
thirsty
as
a
camel
out
with
your
toasting
iron
thrust
away
hayward
of
conkey
jem
went
in
search
of
such
provisions
as
his
hovel
afforded
turpin
meantime
lent
his
assistance
towards
the
revival
of
alan
rookwood
and
it
was
not
long
before
his
efforts
united
with
those
of
luke
were
successful
and
alan
restored
to
consciousness
he
was
greatly
surprised
to
find
the
highwayman
had
joined
them
and
expressed
an
earnest
desire
to
quit
the
hut
as
speedily
as
possible
that
shall
be
done
forthwith
my
dear
fellow
said
dick
but
if
you
had
fasted
as
long
as
i
have
done
and
gone
through
a
few
of
my
fatigues
into
the
bargain
you
would
perceive
without
difficulty
the
propriety
of
supping
before
you
started
here
comes
old
nosey
with
a
flitch
of
bacon
and
a
loaf
egad
i
can
scarce
wait
for
the
toasting
in
my
present
mood
i
could
almost
devour
a
grunter
in
the
sty
whereupon
he
applied
himself
to
the
loaf
and
to
a
bottle
of
stout
march
ale
which
jem
placed
upon
the
table
quaffing
copious
draughts
of
the
latter
while
the
ferryman
employed
himself
in
toasting
certain
rashers
of
the
flitch
upon
the
hissing
embers
luke
meanwhile
stalked
impatiently
about
the
room
he
had
laid
aside
his
tridental
spear
having
first
however
placed
a
pistol
within
his
breast
to
be
ready
for
instant
service
should
occasion
demand
it
as
he
could
now
put
little
reliance
upon
the
ferryman
fidelity
he
glanced
with
impatience
at
turpin
who
pursued
his
meal
with
steady
voracity
worthy
of
a
soldier
but
the
highwayman
returned
no
answer
to
his
looks
except
such
as
was
conveyed
by
the
incessant
clatter
of
his
masticating
jaws
during
the
progress
of
his
apparently
interminable
repast
ready
for
you
in
a
second
sir
luke
said
dick
all
right
now
capital
ale
charon
strong
as
styx
ha
ha
one
other
rasher
and
i
done
sorry
to
keep
you
ca
conceive
how
cleverly
i
put
the
winkers
upon
at
york
in
the
dress
of
a
countryman
all
owing
to
old
balty
the
patrico
an
old

old
pals
never
upon
me
eh
nosey
always
help
one
out
of
the
water
always
staunch
health
to
you
old
crony
jem
returned
a
sulky
response
as
he
placed
the
last
rasher
on
the
table
which
was
speedily
discussed
poor
bess
muttered
dick
as
he
quaffed
off
the
final
glass
of
ale
poor
lass
we
buried
her
by
the
roadside
beneath
the
trees
deep
deep
her
remains
shall
never
be
disturbed
alas
alas
my
bonny
black
bess
but
no
matter
her
name
is
yet
alive
her
deeds
will
survive
her
the
trial
is
over
and
now
continued
he
rising
from
his
seat
i
with
you
where
are
the
tits
in
the
stable
under
ground
growled
jem
alan
rookwood
in
the
mean
time
had
joined
his
grandson
and
they
conversed
an
instant
or
two
apart
my
strength
will
not
bear
me
through
the
night
said
he
that
fellow
has
thoroughly
disabled
me
you
must
go
without
me
to
the
hall
here
is
the
key
of
the
secret
passage
you
know
the
entrance
i
will
await
you
in
the
tomb
the
tomb
echoed
luke
ay
our
family
vault
returned
alan
with
a
ghastly
grin
it
is
the
only
place
of
security
for
me
now
let
me
see
there
let
me
know
that
my
vengeance
is
complete
that
i
triumph
in
my
death
over
him
the
accursed
through
you
my
grandson
have
a
rival
brother
a
successful
one
you
know
now
what
hatred
is
i
do
returned
luke
fiercely
but
not
such
hate
as
mine
which
through
a
life
a
long
life
hath
endured
intense
as
when
was
first
engendered
in
my
bosom
which
hath
spread
all
my
race
all
save
and
which
even
now
when
death
stares
me
in
the
face
when
the
spirit
pants
to
fly
from
its
burns
fiercely
as
ever
you
can
not
know
what
hate
like
that
may
be
you
must
have
wrongs
such
wrongs
as
first
my
hate
to
ranulph
is
bitter
as
your
own
to
sir
reginald
name
him
not
shrieked
alan
but
oh
to
think
upon
the
bride
he
robbed
me
of
the
young
the
beautiful
whom
i
loved
to
madness
whose
memory
is
a
barbed
shaft
yet
rankling
keen
as
ever
at
my
heart
god
of
justice
how
is
it
that
i
have
thus
long
survived
but
some
men
die
by
inches
my
dying
lips
shall
name
him
once
again
and
then
be
but
to
blend
his
name
with
curses
i
speak
of
him
no
more
said
luke
i
will
meet
you
in
the
vault
remember
is
her
wedding
day
with
ranulph
think
you
i
forget
it
bear
it
constantly
in
mind
dawn
must
see
her
or
you
have
her
oath
to
you
or
to
death
she
is
affianced
if
she
should
hesitate
in
her
election
do
not
you
hesitate
woman
will
is
fickle
her
scruples
of
conscience
will
be
readily
overcome
she
will
not
heed
her
vows
but
let
her
not
escape
you
cast
off
all
your
weakness
you
are
young
and
not
as
i
am
be
firm
and
added
he
with
a
look
of
terrible
meaning
if
all
else
should
fail
if
you
are
surrounded
if
you
can
not
bear
her
off
use
this
and
he
placed
a
dagger
in
luke
hands
it
has
avenged
me
ere
now
on
a
perjured
wife
it
will
avenge
you
of
a
forsworn
mistress
and
remove
all
obstacle
to
rookwood
luke
took
the
weapon
would
you
have
me
kill
her
demanded
he
sooner
than
she
should
be
ranulph
ay
aught
sooner
than
that
but
i
would
not
murder
both
both
echoed
alan
i
understand
you
not
sybil
and
eleanor
replied
luke
for
as
surely
as
i
live
death
will
lie
at
my
door
how
so
asked
alan
the
poison
was
true
replied
luke
with
terrible
emphasis
but
i
hearken
to
me
said
he
hollowly
whispering
in
his
grandsire
ears
methinks
i
am
not
long
for
this
world
i
have
seen
her
since
her
death
tut
tut
replied
alan
is
not
for
you
a
man
to
talk
thus
a
truce
to
these
womanish
fancies
womanish
or
not
returned
luke
either
my
fancy
has
deceived
me
or
i
beheld
her
distinctly
as
i
now
behold
you
within
yon
cave
while
you
were
sleeping
by
my
side
it
is
disordered
fancy
said
alan
rookwood
you
will
live
live
to
inherit
rookwood
live
to
see
them
fall
crushed
beneath
your
feet
for
myself
if
i
but
see
you
master
of
eleanor
hand
or
know
that
she
no
longer
lives
to
bless
your
rival
or
to
mar
your
prospects
i
care
not
how
soon
i
brave
my
threatened
doom
of
one
or
other
you
shall
be
resolved
said
luke
placing
the
dagger
within
his
vest
at
this
moment
a
trampling
of
a
horse
was
heard
before
the
hovel
and
in
another
instant
a
loud
knocking
resounded
from
the
door
the
ferryman
instantly
extinguished
the
light
motioning
his
companions
to
remain
silent
what
ho
shouted
a
voice
ferry
wanted
gad
zooks
exclaimed
dick
as
i
live
is
major
mowbray
major
mowbray
echoed
alan
in
amazement
what
doth
he
here
he
must
be
on
his
way
from
york
to
rookwood
i
conclude
said
dick
if
he
here
i
engage
the
others
are
not
far
off
scarcely
were
the
words
out
of
dick
mouth
when
further
clatter
was
heard
at
the
door
and
the
tones
of
coates
were
heard
in
key
demanding
admittance
let
us
retire
into
the
next
room
whispered
turpin
and
then
admit
them
by
all
means
conkey
and
hark
ye
manage
to
detain
them
a
few
seconds
i
do
it
said
jem
there
a
bit
of
a
hole
you
can
peep
through
another
loud
was
heard
at
the
door
threatening
to
burst
it
from
its
hinges
well
i
be
coming
said
jem
seeing
the
coast
was
clear
in
a
drowsy
yawning
tone
as
if
just
awakened
from
sleep
you
cross
the
river
none
the
faster
for
making
so
much
noise
with
these
words
he
unbarred
the
door
and
coates
and
paterson
who
it
appeared
were
proceeding
to
rookwood
entered
the
hovel
major
mowbray
remained
on
horseback
at
the
door
can
you
find
us
a
glass
of
brandy
to
keep
out
the
fog
said
coates
who
knew
something
of
our
ferryman
vocations
i
know
you
are
a
lad
of
amazing
may
be
i
can
master
if
i
choose
but
wo
the
other
gemman
walk
likewise
no
no
said
coates
major
mowbray
do
choose
to
dismount
well
as
you
please
said
jem
it
take
me
a
minute
or
two
to
get
the
punt
in
order
for
all
them
prads
the
brandy
in
the
first
place
said
coates
what
here
added
the
loquacious
attorney
noticing
the
remnants
of
turpin
repast
but
that
we
hurried
i
should
like
a
little
frizzled
bacon
myself
jem
opened
the
door
of
his
dormitory
with
the
greatest
caution
though
apparent
indifference
and
almost
instantly
returned
with
the
brandy
coates
filled
a
glass
for
paterson
and
then
another
for
himself
the
ferryman
left
the
house
apparently
to
prepare
his
boat
half
closing
the
door
after
him
by
my
faith
this
is
the
right
thing
paterson
said
the
attorney
we
may
be
sure
the
strength
of
this
was
never
tested
by
a
gauger
proof
take
another
thimbleful
we
twelve
miles
and
a
heavy
pull
to
go
through
ere
we
reach
rookwood
after
all
we
made
but
a
poor
work
of
it
master
constable
cursed
stupid
in
us
to
let
him
escape
i
only
wish
we
had
such
another
chance
ah
if
we
had
him
within
reach
now
how
we
would
spring
upon
him
secure
him
in
an
instant
i
should
glory
in
the
encounter
i
tell
you
what
paterson
if
ever
he
is
taken
i
shall
make
a
point
of
attending
his
execution
and
see
whether
he
dies
game
ha
ha
you
think
he
sure
to
swing
paterson
eh
why
yes
replied
the
chief
constable
i
wish
i
was
as
certain
of
my
reward
as
that
turpin
will
eventually
figure
at
the
your
reward
replied
coates
make
yourself
easy
on
that
score
my
boy
you
shall
have
your
dues
depend
upon
it
nay
for
the
matter
of
that
i
give
you
the
money
now
if
you
think
proper
nothing
like
time
present
said
paterson
we
make
all
square
at
once
well
then
said
coates
taking
out
a
you
shall
have
the
hundred
i
promised
you
wo
get
turpin
reward
the
three
hundred
pounds
but
that
ca
be
helped
you
shall
have
mine
always
a
man
of
my
word
paterson
continued
the
attorney
counting
out
the
money
my
father
the
was
a
man
of
his
word
before
me
no
doubt
said
the
chief
constable
i
shall
always
be
happy
to
serve
you
and
then
there
that
other
affair
said
the
attorney
mysteriously
still
occupied
in
doling
out
his
that
luke
bradley
case
the
fellow
i
mean
who
calls
himself
sir
luke
rookwood
ha
ha
a
rank
impostor
two
fives
that

i
was
saying

may
make
a
good
job
of
that
we
must
ferret
him
out
i
know
who
will
come
down
properly
for
that
and
if
we
could
only
tuck
him
up
with
his
brother
blade
why
it
would
be
worth
double
he
all
along
been
a
thorn
in
my
lady
rookwood
side

artful
scoundrel

coates
he

dick

said
dick
suddenly
snatching
the
whole
sum
from
paterson
hands
and
felling
the
chief
constable
with
a
blow
of
one
of
his
pistols
i
wish
i
was
as
sure
of
escaping
the
gallows
as
i
am
certain
that
paterson
has
got
his
reward
you
stare
sir
you
are
once
more
in
the
hands
of
the
philistines
see
who
is
at
your
elbow
coates
who
was
terrified
almost
out
of
his
senses
at
the
sight
of
turpin
scarcely
ventured
to
turn
his
head
but
when
he
did
so
he
was
perfectly
at
the
threatening
aspect
of
luke
who
held
a
cutlass
in
his
hand
which
he
had
picked
up
in
the
ferryman
bedroom
so
you
would
condemn
me
for
crimes
i
have
never
committed
said
luke
i
am
tempted
i
own
to
add
the
destruction
of
your
worthless
existence
to
their
number
mercy
for
god
sake
mercy
cried
coates
throwing
himself
at
feet
i
meant
not
what
i
said
hence
reptile
said
luke
pushing
him
aside
i
leave
you
to
be
dealt
upon
by
others
at
this
juncture
the
door
of
the
hut
was
flung
open
and
in
rushed
major
mowbray
sword
in
hand
followed
by
conkey
jem
there
he
stands
sir
cried
the
latter
upon
him
what
conkey
jem
turned
snitch
upon
his
pals
cried
dick
i
scarce
believe
my
own
ears
make
yourself
scarce
dick
growled
jem
the
jigger
open
and
the
boat
loose
leave
luke
to
his
fate
he
sold
never
vile
traitor
shouted
dick
is
thou
art
not
he
and
almost
ere
the
words
were
spoken
a
ball
was
lodged
in
the
brain
of
the
treacherous
ferryman
major
mowbray
meanwhile
had
rushed
furiously
upon
luke
who
met
his
assault
with
determined
calmness
the
strife
was
sharp
and
threatened
a
speedy
and
fatal
issue
on
the
major
side
it
was
a
desperate
attack
of
cut
and
thrust
which
luke
had
some
difficulty
in
parrying
but
as
yet
no
wounds
were
inflicted
soldier
as
was
the
major
luke
was
not
a
whit
inferior
to
him
in
his
knowledge
of
the
science
of
defence
and
in
the
exercise
of
the
broadsword
he
was
perhaps
the
more
skilful
of
the
two
upon
the
present
occasion
his
coolness
stood
him
in
admirable
stead
seeing
him
hard
pressed
turpin
would
have
come
to
his
assistance
but
luke
shouted
to
him
to
stand
aside
and
all
that
dick
could
do
amid
the
terrific
clash
of
steel
was
to
kick
the
tables
out
of
the
way
of
the
combatants
luke
aim
was
now
slightly
grazed
by
a
cut
made
by
the
major
which
he
had
parried
the
smart
of
the
wound
roused
his
ire
he
attacked
his
adversary
in
his
turn
with
so
much
vigor
and
good
will
that
driven
backwards
by
the
irresistible
assault
major
mowbray
stumbled
over
the
ferryman
body
which
happened
to
lie
in
his
way
and
his
sword
being
struck
from
his
grasp
his
life
became
at
once
at
his
assailant
disposal
luke
sheathed
his
sword
major
mowbray
said
he
sternly
your
life
is
in
my
power
i
spare
it
for
the
blood
that
is
between
us
for
your
sister
sake
i
would
not
raise
my
hand
against
her
brother
i
disclaim
your
kindred
with
me
villain
wrathfully
exclaimed
the
major
i
hold
you
no
otherwise
than
as
a
wretched
impostor
who
has
set
up
claims
he
can
not
justify
and
as
to
my
sister
if
you
dare
to
couple
her
name
and
the
major
made
an
ineffectual
attempt
to
raise
himself
and
to
regain
his
sword
which
turpin
however
removed
dare
echoed
luke
scornfully
hereafter
you
may
learn
to
fear
my
threats
and
acknowledge
the
extent
of
my
daring
and
in
that
confidence
i
give
you
life
listen
to
me
sir
i
am
bound
for
rookwood
i
have
private
access
to
the
house
to
your
sister
chamber
mark
you
that
i
shall
go
armed
attended
this
night
she
shall
be
mine
from
you
from
ranulph
from
lady
rookwood
from
all
will
i
bear
her
off
she
shall
be
mine
and
you
before
the
dawn
my
brother
or
and
luke
paused
what
further
villainy
remains
untold
inquired
the
major
fiercely
you
shall
bewail
your
sister
memory
replied
luke
gloomily
i
embrace
the
latter
alternative
with
rapture
replied
the
major
god
grant
her
firmness
to
resist
you
but
i
tremble
for
her
and
the
stern
soldier
groaned
aloud
in
his
agony
here
is
a
cord
to
bind
him
said
turpin
he
must
remain
a
prisoner
here
right
said
alan
rookwood
unless
but
enough
blood
has
been
shed
already
ay
marry
has
there
said
dick
and
i
had
rather
not
have
given
conkey
jem
a
taste
of
blue
plumb
had
there
been
any
other
mode
of
silencing
the
snitching
scoundrel
which
there
was
not
as
to
the
major
he
a
gallant
enemy
and
shall
have
fair
play
as
long
as
dick
turpin
stands
by
come
sir
added
he
to
the
major
as
he
bound
him
hand
and
foot
with
the
rope
i
do
it
as
gently
as
i
can
you
had
better
submit
with
a
good
grace
there
no
help
for
it
and
now
for
my
friend
paterson
who
was
so
anxious
to
furnish
me
with
a
hempen
cravat
before
my
neck
was
in
order
he
shall
have
an
extra
twist
of
the
rope
himself
to
teach
him
the
inconvenience
of
a
tight
neckcloth
when
he
recovers
saying
which
he
bound
paterson
in
such
a
manner
that
any
attempt
at
liberation
on
the
chief
constable
part
would
infallibly
strangle
him
as
to
you
coates
said
he
addressing
the
trembling
man
of
law
you
shall
proceed
to
rookwood
with
us
you
may
yet
be
useful
and
accommodate
you
with
a
seat
behind
my
own
saddle
a
distinction
i
never
yet
conferred
upon
any
of
your
tribe
recollect
the
countryman
at
the
at
york
ha
ha
come
along
sir
and
having
kicked
out
the
turf
fire
dick
prepared
to
depart
it
would
be
vain
to
describe
the
feelings
of
rage
and
despair
which
agitated
the
major
bosom
as
he
saw
the
party
quit
the
hovel
accompanied
by
coates
aware
as
he
was
of
their
destination
after
one
or
two
desperate
but
ineffectual
attempts
to
liberate
himself
by
which
he
only
increased
the
painful
constriction
of
his
bonds
without
in
the
slightest
degree
ameliorating
his
condition
he
resigned
himself
with
bitterest
forebodings
to
his
fate
there
was
no
one
even
to
sympathize
with
his
sufferings
beside
him
lay
the
gory
corpse
of
the
ferryman
and
at
a
little
distance
the
scarcely
more
animate
frame
of
the
chief
constable
and
here
we
must
leave
him
to
follow
for
a
short
space
the
course
of
luke
and
his
companions
concerning
themselves
little
about
their
own
steeds
the
party
took
those
which
first
offered
and
embarking
man
and
horse
in
the
boat
soon
pushed
across
the
waters
of
the
lutulent
don
arrived
at
the
opposite
banks
of
the
river
they
mounted
and
guided
by
luke
after
half
an
hour
sharp
riding
arrived
at
the
skirts
of
rookwood
park
entering
this
beautiful
sylvan
domain
they
rode
for
some
time
silently
among
the
trees
till
they
reached
the
knoll
whence
luke
beheld
the
hall
on
the
eventful
night
of
his
discovery
of
his
mother
wedding
ring
a
few
days
only
had
elapsed
but
during
that
brief
space
what
storms
had
swept
over
his
bosom
what
ravages
had
they
not
made
he
was
then
all
ardor
all
impetuosity
all
independence
the
future
presented
a
bright
unclouded
prospect
wealth
honors
and
happiness
apparently
awaited
him
it
was
still
the
same
exquisite
scene
hushed
holy
tranquil
even
solemn
as
upon
that
glorious
night
the
moon
was
out
silvering
wood
and
water
and
shining
on
the
white
walls
of
the
tranquil
mansion
nature
was
calm
serene
peaceful
as
ever
beneath
the
trees
he
saw
the
bounding
deer
upon
the
water
the
misty
wreaths
of
vapor
all
all
was
dreamy
delightful
soothing
all
save
his
heart
was
the
conflict
the
change
was
it
a
troubled
dream
with
the
dark
oppression
of
which
he
was
struggling
or
was
it
stern
waking
actual
life
that
moment
review
of
his
wild
career
was
terrible
he
saw
to
what
extremes
his
ungovernable
passions
had
hurried
him
he
saw
their
inevitable
consequences
he
saw
also
his
own
fate
but
he
rushed
madly
on
he
swept
round
the
park
keeping
under
the
covert
of
the
wood
till
he
arrived
at
the
avenue
leading
to
the
mansion
the
stems
of
the
aged
limes
gleamed
silvery
white
in
the
moonshine
luke
drew
in
the
rein
beneath
one
of
the
largest
of
the
trees
a
branch
has
fallen
said
he
as
his
grandsire
joined
him
ha
exclaimed
alan
a
branch
from
that
tree
it
bodes
ill
to
ranulph
whispered
luke
does
it
not
perchance
muttered
alan
is
a
vast
bough
we
meet
within
an
hour
said
luke
abruptly
within
the
tomb
of
our
ancestry
replied
alan
i
will
await
you
there
and
as
he
rode
away
alan
murmured
to
himself
the
following
verse
from
one
of
his
own
ballads
but
whether
gale
or
calm
prevail
or
threatening
cloud
hath
fled
by
hand
of
fate
predestinate
a
limb
that
tree
will
shed
a
verdant
bough
untouched
i
trow
by
axe
or
tempest
breath
to
rookwood
head
an
omen
dread
of
fast
approaching
death
i
have
heard
it
rumored
for
these
many
years
none
of
our
family
dies
but
there
is
seen
the
shape
of
an
old
woman
which
is
given
by
tradition
to
us
to
have
been
murthered
by
her
nephews
for
her
riches
such
a
figure
one
night
as
the
prince
sat
up
late
at
book
appeared
to
him
when
crying
out
for
help
the
gentleman
of
his
chamber
found
his
grace
all
in
a
cold
sweat
altered
much
in
face
and
language
since
which
apparition
he
hath
grown
worse
and
worse
and
much
i
fear
he
can
not
live
of
in
one
of
those
large
antique
rooms
belonging
to
the
suite
of
apartments
constituting
the
eastern
wing
of
rookwood
place
upon
the
same
night
as
that
in
which
the
events
just
detailed
took
place
and
it
might
be
about
the
same
time
sat
eleanor
and
her
new
attendant
the
gipsy
handassah
the
eyes
of
the
former
were
fixed
with
a
mixture
of
tenderness
and
pity
upon
the
lineaments
of
another
lovely
female
countenance
bearing
a
striking
resemblance
to
her
own
though
evidently
from
its
attire
and
bygone
costume
not
intended
for
her
depicted
upon
a
tablet
and
placed
upon
a
raised
frame
it
was
nigh
the
witching
hour
of
night
the
room
was
sombre
and
dusky
partially
dismantled
of
its
once
flowing
arras
and
the
lights
set
upon
the
table
feebly
illumined
its
dreary
extent
tradition
marked
it
out
as
the
chamber
in
which
many
of
the
hapless
dames
of
rookwood
had
expired
and
hence
superstition
claimed
it
as
her
peculiar
domain
the
room
was
reputed
to
be
haunted
and
had
for
a
long
space
shared
the
fate
of
haunted
rooms
complete
desertion
it
was
now
tenanted
by
one
too
young
too
pure
to
fear
aught
unearthly
eleanor
seemed
nevertheless
affected
by
the
profound
melancholy
of
the
picture
upon
which
she
gazed
at
length
handassah
observed
her
start
and
avert
her
eye
shudderingly
from
the
picture
take
it
hence
exclaimed
eleanor
i
have
looked
at
that
image
of
my
ancestors
till
it
has
seemed
endowed
with
life
till
its
eyes
have
appeared
to
return
my
gaze
and
weep
remove
it
handassah
handassah
silently
withdrew
the
tablet
placing
it
against
the
wall
of
the
chamber
not
there
not
there
cried
eleanor
turn
it
with
its
face
to
the
wall
i
can
not
bear
those
eyes
and
now
come
hither
girl
draw
nearer
for
i
know
not
what
of
sudden
dread
has
crossed
me
this
was
room
handassah
the
chamber
of
my
ancestress
of
all
the
ladies
rookwood
where
they
say
ha
did
you
not
hear
a
noise
a
rustle
in
the
tapestry
a
footstep
near
the
wall
why
you
look
as
startled
as
i
look
wench
stay
by
me
i
will
not
have
you
stir
from
my
side
was
mere
fancy
no
doubt
lady
said
handassah
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
arras
hist
exclaimed
eleanor
there
is
again
is
nothing
replied
handassah
but
her
looks
belied
her
words
well
i
will
command
myself
said
eleanor
endeavoring
to
regain
her
calmness
but
the
thoughts
of
the
lady
eleanor
for
was
an
eleanor
like
to
me
handassah
and
ah
even
more
and
unhappy
have
brought
a
whole
train
of
melancholy
fancies
into
my
mind
i
can
not
banish
them
nay
though
painful
to
me
i
recur
to
these
images
of
dread
with
a
species
of
fascination
as
if
in
their
fate
i
contemplated
mine
own
not
one
who
hath
wedded
a
rookwood
but
hath
rued
it
yet
you
will
wed
one
said
handassah
he
is
not
like
the
rest
said
eleanor
how
know
you
that
lady
asked
handassah
his
time
may
not
yet
be
come
see
what
will
bring
forth
you
are
averse
to
my
marriage
with
ranulph
handassah
i
was
sybil
handmaid
ere
i
was
yours
lady
i
bear
in
mind
a
solemn
compact
with
the
dead
which
this
marriage
will
violate
you
are
plighted
by
oath
to
another
if
he
should
demand
your
hand
but
he
has
not
demanded
it
would
you
accept
him
were
he
to
do
so
asked
handassah
suddenly
i
meant
not
that
replied
eleanor
my
oath
is
annulled
say
not
so
lady
cried
handassah
was
not
for
this
that
sybil
spared
your
life
i
love
you
but
i
loved
sybil
and
i
would
see
her
dying
behests
complied
with
it
may
not
be
handassah
replied
eleanor
why
from
a
phantom
sense
of
honor
am
i
to
sacrifice
my
whole
existence
to
one
who
neither
can
love
me
nor
whom
i
myself
could
love
am
i
to
wed
this
man
because
in
her
blind
idolatry
of
him
sybil
enforced
an
oath
upon
me
which
i
had
no
power
to
resist
and
which
was
mentally
cancelled
while
taken
recall
not
the
horrors
of
that
dreadful
cell
urge
not
the
subject
more
is
in
the
hope
that
i
may
be
freed
for
ever
from
this
persecution
that
i
have
consented
thus
early
to
wed
with
ranulph
this
will
set
fancied
claims
at
rest
for
ever
handassah
answered
not
but
bent
her
head
as
if
in
acquiescence
steps
were
now
heard
near
the
door
and
a
servant
ushered
in
small
and
mowbray
i
am
come
to
take
leave
of
you
for
the
night
my
dear
young
lady
said
the
doctor
but
before
i
start
for
the
vicarage
i
have
a
word
or
two
to
say
in
addition
to
the
advice
you
were
so
obliging
as
to
receive
from
me
this
morning
suppose
you
allow
your
attendant
to
retire
for
a
few
minutes
what
i
have
got
to
say
concerns
yourself
solely
your
mother
will
bear
us
company
there
continued
the
doctor
as
handassah
was
dismissed
i
am
glad
that
gipsy
has
taken
her
departure
i
ca
say
i
like
her
sharp
suspicious
manner
and
the
first
exercise
i
should
make
at
my
powers
were
i
to
be
your
husband
should
be
to
discharge
the
handmaiden
to
the
point
of
my
visit
we
are
alone
i
think
this
is
a
queer
old
house
miss
mowbray
and
this
is
the
queerest
part
of
it
walls
have
ears
they
say
and
there
are
so
many
holes
and
corners
in
this
mansion
that
one
ought
never
to
talk
secrets
above
one
breath
i
am
yet
to
learn
sir
said
eleanor
that
there
is
any
secret
to
be
communicated
why
not
much
i
own
replied
the
doctor
at
least
what
has
occurred
is
no
secret
in
the
house
by
this
time
what
do
you
think
happened
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
conjecture
nothing
to
ranulph
i
hope
nothing
of
consequence
i
trust
though
he
is
part
concerned
with
it
what
is
it
asked
eleanor
pray
satisfy
her
curiosity
doctor
interposed
mowbray
well
then
said
small
rather
more
gravely
the
fact
of
the
matter
stands
thus
lady
rookwood
who
as
you
know
was
not
the
meekest
wife
in
the
world
now
turns
out
by
no
means
the
gentlest
mother
and
has
within
this
hour
found
out
that
she
has
some
objection
to
your
union
with
her
son
you
alarm
me
doctor
do
alarm
yourself
at
all
it
will
be
got
over
without
difficulty
and
only
requires
a
little
management
ranulph
is
with
her
now
and
i
doubt
not
will
arrange
all
to
her
satisfaction
what
was
her
objection
asked
eleanor
was
it
any
one
founded
upon
my
obligation
to
luke
my
oath
tut
tut
dismiss
that
subject
from
your
mind
entirely
said
the
doctor
that
oath
is
no
more
binding
on
your
conscience
than
would
have
been
the
ties
of
marriage
had
you
been
wedded
by
yon
recusant
romish
priest
father
checkley
upon
whose
guilty
head
the
lord
be
merciful
bestow
not
a
thought
upon
it
my
anxiety
together
with
that
of
your
mother
is
to
see
you
now
as
speedily
as
may
be
wedded
to
ranulph
and
then
that
idle
question
is
set
at
rest
for
ever
and
therefore
even
if
such
a
thing
were
to
occur
as
that
lady
rookwood
should
not
yield
her
consent
to
your
marriage
as
that
consent
is
totally
unnecessary
we
must
go
through
the
ceremonial
without
it
the
grounds
of
lady
rookwood
objections
said
mowbray
ay
the
grounds
of
her
ladyship
objections
interposed
small
who
when
he
had
once
got
the
lead
liked
nobody
to
talk
but
himself
are
simply
these
and
exactly
the
sort
of
objections
one
would
expect
her
to
raise
she
can
not
bear
the
idea
of
abandoning
the
control
of
the
house
and
estates
to
other
hands
she
can
not
and
will
not
relinquish
her
station
as
head
of
the
establishment
which
ranulph
has
insisted
upon
as
your
right
i
thought
when
i
conversed
with
her
on
this
subject
that
she
was
changed
but
naturam
expellas
furcâ
tamen
usque
recurret
i
beg
your
pardon
she
is
and
always
will
be
the
same
why
did
not
ranulph
concede
the
point
to
her
i
wish
not
to
dwell
here
i
care
not
for
these
domains
for
this
mansion
they
have
no
charms
for
me
i
could
be
happy
with
ranulph
anywhere
happier
anywhere
than
here
the
doctor
squeezed
her
hand
in
reply
brushing
a
tear
from
his
eyes
why
did
he
not
concede
it
said
mowbray
proudly
because
the
choice
remained
not
with
him
it
was
not
his
to
concede
this
house
these
lands
all
all
are
yours
and
it
were
poor
requital
indeed
if
after
they
have
so
long
been
wrongfully
withheld
from
us
you
should
be
a
dependant
on
lady
rookwood
without
going
quite
so
far
as
that
madam
said
the
doctor
it
is
but
justice
to
your
daughter
that
she
should
be
put
in
full
possession
of
her
rights
nor
should
i
for
one
instant
advise
or
even
allow
her
to
inhabit
the
same
house
with
lady
rookwood
her
ladyship
peculiarities
of
temper
are
such
as
to
preclude
all
possibility
of
happiness
at
the
same
time
i
trust
by
management
always
by
management
madam
that
her
ladyship
quiet
departure
may
be
ensured
i
understand
that
all
such
legal
arrangements
in
the
way
of
settlements
as
could
be
entered
into
between
your
daughter
and
her
future
husband
are
completed
i
have
only
to
regret
the
absence
of
my
friend
coates
at
this
momentous
conjuncture
it
will
be
a
loss
to
him
but
he
inherits
from
his
father
a
taste
for
which
he
is
at
present
indulging
to
the
manifest
injury
of
his
legitimate
practice
hark
i
hear
ranulph
step
in
the
gallery
he
will
tell
us
the
result
of
his
final
interview
i
came
to
give
you
advice
my
dear
added
the
doctor
in
a
low
tone
to
eleanor
but
i
find
you
need
it
not
humbleth
himself
shall
be
exalted
i
am
glad
you
do
not
split
upon
the
rock
which
has
stranded
half
your
generation
at
this
moment
ranulph
rookwood
entered
the
room
followed
by
handassah
who
took
her
station
at
the
back
of
the
room
unperceived
by
the
rest
of
the
party
whose
attention
was
attracted
by
ranulph
agitated
manner
what
has
happened
asked
small
and
mowbray
in
the
same
breath
ranulph
hesitated
for
a
moment
in
his
answer
during
which
space
he
regarded
eleanor
with
the
deepest
anxiety
and
seemed
revolving
within
himself
how
he
could
frame
his
reply
in
such
way
as
should
be
least
painful
to
her
feelings
while
with
instinctive
apprehension
of
coming
misfortune
miss
mowbray
eagerly
seconded
the
inquiries
of
her
friends
it
is
with
great
pain
said
he
at
length
in
a
tone
of
despondency
not
unmingled
with
displeasure
that
i
am
obliged
to
descant
upon
the
infirmities
of
a
parent
and
to
censure
her
conduct
as
severely
as
i
may
do
now
i
feel
the
impropriety
of
such
a
step
and
i
would
willingly
avoid
it
could
i
do
so
in
justice
to
my
own
feelings
and
especially
at
a
moment
like
the
present
when
every
hope
of
my
life
is
fixed
upon
uniting
myself
to
you
dear
eleanor
by
ties
as
near
as
my
own
to
that
parent
but
the
interview
which
i
have
just
had
with
lady
rookwood
bitter
and
as
it
has
been
compels
me
to
reprobate
her
conduct
in
the
strongest
terms
as
harsh
unjust
and
dishonorable
and
if
i
could
wholly
throw
off
the
son
as
she
avows
she
has
thrown
off
the
mother
i
should
unhesitatingly
pronounce
it
as
little
short
of
dear
ranulph
said
eleanor
palpitating
with
apprehension
i
never
saw
you
so
much
moved
nor
with
so
much
reason
rejoined
ranulph
for
myself
i
could
endure
anything
but
for
and
does
your
dispute
relate
to
asked
eleanor
is
it
for
sake
you
have
braved
your
mother
displeasure
is
it
because
lady
rookwood
is
unwilling
to
resign
the
control
of
this
house
and
these
lands
to
that
you
have
parted
in
anger
with
her
was
this
the
cause
of
your
quarrel
it
was
the
origin
of
it
replied
ranulph
mother
said
eleanor
firmly
to
mowbray
go
with
me
to
lady
rookwood
chamber
wherefore
demanded
mowbray
question
me
not
dear
mother
or
let
me
go
alone
daughter
i
guess
your
meaning
said
mowbray
sternly
you
would
relinquish
your
claims
in
favor
of
lady
rookwood
is
it
not
so
since
you
oblige
me
to
answer
you
mother
said
eleanor
crimsoning
i
must
admit
that
you
have
guessed
my
meaning
to
lady
rookwood
as
to
yourself
i
would
be
a
daughter
as
far
as
is
consistent
with
my
duty
added
she
blushing
still
more
deeply
but
my
first
consideration
shall
be
my
husband
and
if
lady
rookwood
can
be
content
but
pray
question
me
not
further
accompany
me
to
her
chamber
eleanor
interposed
ranulph
dearest
eleanor
the
sacrifice
you
would
make
is
unnecessary
uncalled
for
you
do
not
know
my
mother
she
would
not
i
grieve
to
say
appreciate
the
generosity
of
your
motives
she
would
not
give
you
credit
for
your
feelings
she
would
only
resent
your
visit
as
an
intrusion
my
daughter
comprehends
you
sir
said
mowbray
haughtily
i
will
take
care
that
in
her
own
house
miss
mowbray
shall
remain
free
from
insult
mother
dear
mother
said
eleanor
do
not
wilfully
misunderstand
him
you
can
be
little
aware
madam
said
ranulph
calmly
yet
sadly
how
much
i
have
recently
endured
how
much
of
parental
anger
how
much
of
parental
malediction
i
have
incurred
to
save
you
and
your
daughter
from
the
indignity
you
apprehend
as
i
before
said
you
do
not
know
my
mother
nor
could
it
enter
into
any
imagination
to
conceive
the
extremities
to
which
the
violence
of
her
passion
will
when
her
schemes
are
thwarted
hurry
her
the
terms
upon
which
you
met
together
will
not
escape
your
recollection
nor
shall
i
need
to
recall
to
your
mind
her
haughtiness
her
coldness
that
coldness
has
since
ripened
into
distrust
and
the
match
which
she
was
at
first
all
anxiety
to
promote
she
would
now
utterly
set
aside
were
it
in
her
power
to
do
so
whence
this
alteration
in
her
views
has
arisen
i
have
no
means
of
ascertaining
it
is
not
my
mother
custom
to
give
a
reason
for
her
actions
or
her
wishes
it
is
to
express
them
i
have
perceived
as
the
time
has
drawn
nigh
for
the
fulfilment
of
my
dearest
hopes
that
her
unwillingness
has
increased
until
what
had
hitherto
been
confined
to
hints
has
been
openly
expressed
and
absolute
objections
raised
such
however
is
the
peculiarity
of
her
temper
that
i
trusted
even
at
the
eleventh
hour
i
should
be
able
to
work
a
change
alas
our
last
meeting
was
decisive
she
commanded
me
to
break
off
the
match
at
once
and
peremptorily
i
refused
pardon
me
madam
pardon
me
dearest
eleanor
if
i
thus
enter
into
particulars
it
is
absolutely
necessary
i
should
be
explicit
enraged
at
my
opposition
to
her
wishes
her
fury
became
ungovernable
with
appalling
imprecations
upon
the
memory
of
my
poor
father
and
upon
father
madam
whose
chief
offence
in
her
eyes
was
it
seems
the
disposition
of
his
property
to
eleanor
she
bade
me
be
gone
and
take
her
curses
as
my
wedding
portion
beneath
this
roof
beneath
roof
she
added
no
marriage
of
mine
should
take
place
i
might
go
hence
or
might
stay
as
i
thought
fitting
but
you
and
your
daughter
whom
she
characterized
as
intruders
should
not
remain
another
hour
within
her
house
to
this
wild
raving
i
answered
with
as
much
composure
as
i
could
command
that
she
entirely
mistook
her
own
position
and
that
so
far
from
the
odium
of
intrusion
resting
with
you
if
applicable
to
any
one
the
term
must
necessarily
affix
itself
on
those
who
through
ignorance
had
for
years
unjustly
deprived
the
rightful
owners
of
this
place
of
their
inheritance
upon
this
her
wrath
was
boundless
she
disowned
me
as
her
son
disclaimed
all
maternal
regard
and
heaped
upon
my
head
a
frightful
malediction
at
the
recollection
of
which
i
still
tremble
i
will
spare
you
further
details
of
this
dreadful
scene
to
me
it
is
most
distressing
for
however
firmly
resolved
i
may
be
to
pursue
a
line
of
conduct
which
every
sound
principle
within
me
dictates
as
the
correct
one
yet
i
can
not
be
insensible
to
the
awful
responsibility
i
shall
incur
in
bringing
down
a
mother
curse
upon
my
head
nor
to
the
jeopardy
in
which
her
own
excessive
violence
may
place
her
mowbray
listened
to
ranulph
explanation
in
haughty
displeasure
eleanor
with
throbbing
tearful
interest
small
with
mixed
feelings
of
anger
and
astonishment
lady
rookwood
conduct
said
the
doctor
is
you
must
forgive
me
my
dear
sir
ranulph
for
using
strong
expressions
outrageous
beyond
all
precedent
and
only
excusable
on
the
ground
of
insanity
to
which
i
wish
it
were
possible
we
could
attribute
it
there
is
however
too
much
method
in
her
madness
to
allow
us
to
indulge
any
such
notion
she
is
shrewd
dangerous
and
designing
and
since
she
has
resolved
to
oppose
this
match
she
will
leave
no
means
untried
to
do
so
i
scarcely
know
how
to
advise
you
under
the
circumstances
that
is
if
my
advice
were
asked
which
i
scarcely
think
it
likely
to
be
sir
said
mowbray
coldly
after
what
has
occurred
shall
think
it
my
duty
to
break
off
this
alliance
which
i
have
never
considered
to
be
so
desirable
that
its
rupture
will
occasion
me
an
instant
uneasiness
a
plague
on
all
these
rookwoods
muttered
small
one
would
think
all
the
pride
of
the
prince
of
darkness
were
centered
in
their
bosoms
but
madam
continued
the
benevolent
doctor
have
you
no
consideration
for
the
feelings
of
your
daughter
or
for
those
of
one
who
is
no
distant
relation
to
you
your
nephew
your
son
major
mowbray
is
if
i
mistake
not
most
eager
for
this
union
to
take
place
between
his
sister
and
his
friend
my
children
have
been
accustomed
to
yield
implicit
obedience
to
my
wishes
said
mowbray
and
major
mowbray
i
am
sure
will
see
the
propriety
of
the
step
i
am
about
to
take
i
am
content
at
least
to
abide
by
opinion
snubbed
again
mentally
ejaculated
the
doctor
with
a
shrug
of
despair
it
is
useless
attempting
to
work
upon
such
impracticable
material
ranulph
remained
mute
in
an
attitude
of
profound
melancholy
an
eloquent
interchange
of
glances
had
passed
between
him
and
eleanor
communicating
to
each
the
anxious
state
of
the
other
feelings
at
this
crisis
the
door
was
suddenly
opened
and
old
agnes
lady
rookwood
aged
attendant
rushed
into
the
room
and
sank
upon
her
knees
on
the
floor
her
limbs
shaking
her
teeth
chattering
and
every
feature
expressive
of
intense
terror
ranulph
went
instantly
towards
her
to
demand
the
cause
of
her
alarm
no
let
me
pray
cried
agnes
as
he
took
her
hand
in
the
attempt
to
raise
her
let
me
pray
while
there
is
yet
time
let
the
worthy
doctor
pray
beside
me
pray
for
an
overladen
soul
sir
pray
heartily
as
you
would
hope
for
mercy
yourself
ah
little
know
the
righteous
of
the
terrors
of
those
that
are
beyond
the
pale
of
mercy
the
lord
pardon
me
my
iniquities
and
absolve
whom
do
you
mean
asked
ranulph
in
agitation
you
do
not
allude
to
my
mother
you
have
no
longer
a
mother
young
man
said
agnes
solemnly
what
exclaimed
ranulph
is
she
dead
she
is
gone
gone
how
whither
exclaimed
all
their
amazement
increasing
each
instant
at
the
terror
of
the
old
woman
and
the
apparently
terrible
occasion
of
it
speak
exclaimed
ranulph
but
why
do
i
loiter
my
mother
perchance
is
dying
let
me
go
the
old
woman
maintained
her
clutching
grasp
which
was
strong
and
convulsive
as
that
of
one
struggling
betwixt
life
and
death
it
of
no
use
i
tell
you
it
all
over
said
she
the
dead
are
come
the
dead
are
come
and
she
is
gone
whither
whither
to
the
grave
to
the
tomb
said
agnes
in
a
deep
and
hollow
tone
and
with
a
look
that
froze
ranulph
soul
listen
to
me
ranulph
rookwood
my
child
my
nursling
listen
while
i
speak
we
were
alone
your
mother
and
i
after
that
scene
between
you
after
the
dark
denunciations
she
had
heaped
upon
the
dead
when
i
heard
a
low
and
gasping
kind
of
sob
and
there
i
saw
your
mother
staring
wildly
upon
the
vacancy
as
if
she
saw
that
of
which
i
dare
not
think
what
think
you
she
beheld
asked
ranulph
quaking
with
apprehension
that
which
had
been
your
father
returned
agnes
in
a
hollow
tone
do
doubt
me
sir
you
find
the
truth
of
what
i
say
anon
i
am
sure
he
was
there
there
was
a
thrilling
speechless
horror
in
the
very
sight
of
her
countenance
that
froze
my
old
blood
to
ice
to
the
ice
in
which
is
now
ough
ough
well
at
length
she
arose
with
her
eyes
still
fixed
and
passed
through
the
paneled
door
without
a
word
she
is
gone
what
madness
is
this
cried
ranulph
let
me
go
woman
is
that
ruffian
in
disguise
she
may
be
murdered
no
no
shrieked
agnes
it
was
no
disguise
she
is
gone
i
tell
you
the
room
was
empty
all
the
rooms
were
empty
the
passage
was
void
through
the
door
they
went
together
silently
silently
ghostlike
slow
ha
that
tomb
they
are
there
together
now
he
has
her
in
his
arms
see
they
are
here
they
glide
through
the
door
do
you
not
see
them
now
did
i
not
speak
the
truth
she
is
dead
ha
ha
and
with
a
frantic
and
bewildering
laugh
the
old
woman
fell
upon
her
face
ranulph
raised
her
from
the
floor
but
the
shock
of
what
she
had
beheld
had
been
too
much
for
her
she
was
dead
dower
of
now
art
thou
come
thou
ghastly
there
sits
in
thy
face
some
great
determination
mixed
with
some
fear
thus
it
lightens
into
action
i
am
come
to
kill
thee
of
ranulph
rookwood
was
for
some
moments
so
much
stunned
by
the
ghastly
fate
of
agnes
connected
as
it
appeared
to
be
with
a
supernatural
summons
similar
to
that
which
he
imagined
he
had
himself
received
that
he
was
incapable
of
stirring
from
the
spot
or
removing
his
gaze
from
the
rigid
features
of
the
corpse
which
even
in
death
wore
the
strong
impress
of
horror
and
despair
through
life
he
knew
that
agnes
his
own
nurse
had
been
his
mother
constant
and
faithful
attendant
the
unhesitating
agent
of
her
schemes
and
it
was
to
be
feared
from
the
remorse
she
had
exhibited
the
participator
of
her
crimes
and
ranulph
felt
he
knew
not
why
that
in
having
witnessed
her
terrible
end
he
beheld
the
ultimate
condition
of
his
own
parent
conquering
not
without
great
effort
the
horror
which
had
riveted
him
to
the
spot
he
turned
to
look
towards
eleanor
she
had
sunk
upon
a
chair
a
silent
witness
of
the
scene
mowbray
and
small
having
upon
the
first
alarm
given
by
agnes
respecting
lady
rookwood
departure
from
the
house
quitted
the
room
to
ascertain
the
truth
of
her
statement
ranulph
immediately
flew
to
eleanor
ranulph
said
she
though
almost
overcome
by
her
alarm
stay
not
an
instant
here
with
me
i
am
sure
from
that
poor
woman
dreadful
death
that
something
terrible
has
occurred
perhaps
to
lady
rookwood
go
to
her
chamber
tarry
not
i
entreat
of
you
but
will
you
can
you
remain
here
alone
with
that
body
asked
ranulph
i
shall
not
be
alone
handassah
is
within
call
nay
she
is
here
oh
what
an
eve
of
our
espousals
has
this
been
dear
ranulph
our
whole
life
is
a
troubled
volume
of
which
each
successive
leaf
grows
darker
fate
is
opposed
to
us
it
is
useless
to
contend
with
our
destiny
i
fear
we
shall
never
be
united
dismiss
me
not
with
words
like
those
dear
eleanor
returned
ranulph
fate
can
not
have
greater
woes
in
store
for
us
than
those
by
which
we
are
now
opposed
let
us
hope
that
we
are
now
at
that
point
whence
all
must
brighten
once
possessed
of
you
assured
of
thus
much
happiness
i
would
set
even
fate
at
defiance
and
you
will
be
mine
ranulph
dear
ranulph
your
suit
at
this
moment
is
desperate
i
dare
not
can
not
pledge
myself
you
yourself
heard
even
now
my
sentiments
and
i
can
not
marry
without
her
consent
your
mother
like
my
own
regards
not
the
feelings
of
her
children
forgive
my
boldness
eleanor
forgive
me
if
i
linger
now
when
duty
calls
me
hence
but
i
can
not
tear
myself
away
your
mother
may
return
my
hopes
be
crushed
for
even
your
love
for
me
seems
annihilated
in
her
presence
ranulph
your
vehemence
terrifies
me
rejoined
eleanor
i
implore
you
by
the
tender
affection
which
you
know
i
bear
you
not
to
urge
me
further
at
this
moment
recall
your
firmer
feelings
and
obtain
some
mastery
over
yourself
i
repeat
i
am
yours
only
if
i
am
bride
of
any
one
but
when
our
union
can
take
place
rests
not
with
myself
and
now
i
entreat
of
you
leave
me
you
are
mine
said
ranulph
with
fervor
mine
only
yours
only
replied
eleanor
be
this
the
earnest
of
my
happiness
exclaimed
ranulph
imprinting
a
long
and
impassioned
kiss
upon
her
lips
the
lovers
were
startled
from
their
embrace
by
a
profound
sigh
it
proceeded
from
handassah
who
unbidden
had
replaced
the
picture
of
the
lady
eleanor
upon
its
frame
the
augury
seemed
sinister
every
one
who
has
gazed
steadfastly
upon
a
portrait
must
have
noticed
the
peculiar
and
lifelike
character
which
under
certain
aspects
the
eyes
will
assume
seen
by
the
imperfect
light
upon
the
table
the
whole
character
of
the
countenance
of
the
lady
eleanor
seemed
changed
the
features
appeared
to
be
stamped
with
melancholy
and
the
eyes
to
be
fixed
with
pitying
tenderness
upon
her
descendants
both
gazed
at
each
other
and
at
the
picture
struck
with
the
same
sentiment
of
undefined
awe
beside
them
stood
the
dark
figure
of
the
gipsy
girl
watching
with
satisfaction
the
effect
of
her
handiwork
ranulph
was
aroused
from
his
abstraction
by
hearing
a
loud
outcry
in
mowbray
voice
hastily
committing
eleanor
to
the
care
of
her
attendant
he
left
the
room
handassah
followed
him
to
the
door
closed
it
after
him
and
then
locked
it
within
side
this
done
she
walked
back
hastily
towards
eleanor
exclaiming
in
a
tone
of
exultation
you
have
parted
with
him
forever
what
mean
you
girl
cried
eleanor
alarmed
at
her
manner
why
have
you
fastened
the
door
open
it
i
command
you
command
laughed
handassah
scornfully
what
if
i
refuse
your
mandate
what
if
in
my
turn
i
bid
obey
i
never
owned
but
one
mistress
if
i
have
bowed
my
neck
to
you
for
a
time
was
to
fulfil
her
dying
wishes
if
i
have
submitted
to
your
control
it
was
to
accomplish
what
i
have
now
accomplished
your
oath
remember
your
oath
the
hour
is
come
for
its
fulfilment
with
these
words
handassah
clapped
her
hands
a
panel
in
the
wall
opened
and
luke
stood
suddenly
before
them
silently
and
with
stern
deliberation
he
strode
towards
eleanor
and
seizing
one
of
her
hands
drew
her
forcibly
towards
him
eleanor
resisted
not
she
had
not
the
power
neither
did
she
scream
for
so
paralyzing
was
her
terror
that
for
the
moment
it
took
away
all
power
of
utterance
luke
neither
stirred
nor
spoke
but
still
maintaining
his
hold
gazed
searchingly
upon
her
features
while
eleanor
as
if
could
not
withdraw
her
eyes
from
him
nothing
more
terribly
impressive
could
be
conceived
than
luke
whole
appearance
harassed
and
exhausted
by
the
life
he
had
recently
led
deprived
almost
of
natural
rest
goaded
by
remorse
his
frame
was
almost
worn
to
the
bone
while
his
countenance
once
dark
and
swarthy
was
now
blanched
and
colorless
as
marble
this
pallid
and
deathlike
hue
was
in
all
probability
owing
to
the
loss
of
blood
he
had
sustained
from
the
wound
inflicted
by
major
mowbray
with
the
stains
of
which
his
apparel
was
dyed
for
though
staunched
the
effusion
had
been
sufficient
to
cause
great
faintness
his
dark
eyes
blazed
with
their
wonted
fire
nay
they
looked
darker
and
larger
from
his
exceeding
paleness
and
such
intense
mental
and
bodily
suffering
was
imprinted
upon
his
countenance
that
despite
its
fierceness
and
desperation
few
could
have
regarded
him
without
sympathy
real
desperation
has
so
much
of
agony
in
its
character
that
no
one
can
witness
it
unmoved
his
garb
was
not
that
in
which
the
reader
first
beheld
him
but
a
rich
dark
simple
suit
of
velvet
corresponding
more
with
his
real
rank
in
life
than
his
former
peasant
attire
but
it
was
disordered
by
his
recent
conflict
and
stained
with
bloody
testimonials
of
the
fray
while
his
long
sable
curls
once
his
pride
and
ornament
now
hung
in
intertangled
like
a
coil
of
wreathed
even
in
her
terror
as
she
dwelt
upon
his
noble
features
eleanor
could
not
help
admitting
that
she
beheld
the
undoubted
descendant
and
the
living
likeness
of
the
handsomest
and
most
distinguished
of
her
house
the
profligate
and
criminal
sir
reginald
as
her
eye
mechanically
following
this
train
of
thought
wandered
for
an
instant
to
the
haughty
portraiture
of
sir
reginald
which
formed
part
of
the
family
pictures
and
thence
to
those
of
his
unfortunate
lady
she
was
struck
with
the
fancy
that
by
some
terrible
fatality
the
tragic
horrors
of
bygone
days
were
to
be
again
enacted
in
their
persons
and
that
they
were
in
some
way
strangely
identified
with
their
unfortunate
progenitors
so
forcibly
was
this
idea
impressed
upon
her
features
that
luke
who
had
followed
the
direction
of
her
glances
became
instantly
aware
of
it
drawing
her
nearer
to
the
portrait
of
the
lady
eleanor
he
traced
the
resemblance
in
mute
wonder
thence
turning
towards
that
of
sir
reginald
he
proudly
exclaimed
you
doubted
once
my
lineage
maiden
can
you
gaze
on
those
features
which
would
almost
seem
to
be
a
reflection
of
mine
own
and
longer
hesitate
whose
descendant
i
am
i
glory
in
my
likeness
there
is
a
wild
delight
in
setting
human
emotions
at
naught
which
he
was
said
to
feel
which
i
feel
now
within
these
halls
i
seem
to
breathe
an
atmosphere
congenial
to
me
i
visit
what
i
oft
have
visited
in
my
dreams
or
as
in
a
state
of
methinks
as
i
gaze
on
you
i
could
almost
deem
myself
sir
reginald
and
you
his
bride
the
lady
eleanor
our
fates
were
parallel
was
united
to
her
lord
by
ties
of
hatred
by
a
bridal
so
are
you
to
me
and
she
could
escape
him
could
throw
off
her
bondage
nor
shall
you
i
claim
the
fulfilment
of
oath
you
are
never
never
shrieked
eleanor
struggling
to
disengage
herself
but
luke
laughed
at
her
feeble
efforts
handassah
stood
by
a
passive
spectatress
of
the
scene
with
her
arms
folded
upon
her
bosom
you
refuse
compliance
said
luke
scornfully
have
you
no
hopes
of
heaven
no
fears
of
perdition
that
you
dare
to
violate
your
vow
bethink
you
of
the
awful
nature
of
that
obligation
of
the
life
that
was
laid
down
to
purchase
it
of
the
blood
which
will
cry
out
for
vengeance
the
should
you
hesitate
by
that
sacrament
i
claim
you
as
my
own
you
are
mine
and
he
dragged
her
towards
the
opening
eleanor
uttered
a
long
and
terrific
scream
be
silent
on
your
life
added
he
searching
for
the
dagger
given
to
him
by
alan
rookwood
when
as
his
hand
sought
the
weapon
eleanor
escaped
from
his
grasp
and
fled
towards
the
door
but
handassah
had
anticipated
her
intention
the
key
was
withdrawn
from
the
lock
and
the
wretched
maiden
vainly
tried
to
open
it
at
this
instant
turpin
appeared
at
the
sliding
panel
quick
quick
cried
he
impatiently
despatch
in
the
devil
name
the
house
is
alarmed
i
hear
young
ranulph
voice
in
the
gallery
ranulph
shrieked
eleanor
then
i
am
saved
and
she
redoubled
her
outcries
for
assistance
luke
again
seized
his
victim
her
hands
clutched
so
convulsively
fast
in
her
despairing
energy
against
the
handle
of
the
door
that
he
could
not
tear
her
thence
by
this
time
ranulph
rookwood
who
had
caught
her
reiterated
screams
for
help
was
at
the
entrance
he
heard
her
struggles
he
heard
luke
threats
his
mockery
his
derisive
laughter
but
vainly
vainly
did
he
attempt
to
force
it
open
it
was
of
the
strongest
oak
and
the
bolts
resisted
all
his
efforts
a
board
alone
divided
him
from
his
mistress
he
could
hear
her
sobs
and
gasps
he
saw
from
the
action
of
the
handle
with
what
tenacity
she
clung
to
it
and
stung
to
frenzy
by
the
sight
he
hurled
himself
against
the
sturdy
plank
but
all
in
vain
at
length
the
handle
was
still
there
was
a
heavy
fall
upon
the
floor
a
stifled
scream
and
a
sound
as
of
a
body
being
dragged
along
the
thought
was
madness
to
the
panel
to
the
panel
cried
a
voice
it
was
that
of
turpin
from
within
the
panel
ha
echoed
ranulph
with
a
sudden
gleam
of
hope
i
may
yet
save
her
and
he
darted
along
the
corridor
with
the
swiftness
of
thought
luke
meanwhile
had
for
some
minutes
fruitlessly
exhausted
all
his
force
to
drag
eleanor
from
the
door
despair
gave
her
strength
she
clutched
at
the
door
but
she
felt
her
strength
failing
her
her
grasp
was
relaxing
and
then
the
maddening
thought
that
she
would
be
shortly
his
that
he
would
slay
her
while
the
idea
that
ranulph
was
so
near
and
yet
unable
to
protect
her
added
gall
even
to
her
bitterness
with
savage
delight
luke
exulted
in
the
lovers
tortures
he
heard
ineffectual
attempts
he
heard
his
groans
he
heard
their
mutual
cries
inflamed
by
jealousy
he
triumphed
in
his
power
of
vengeance
and
even
prolonged
the
torture
which
accident
had
given
him
the
means
of
inflicting
he
stood
like
the
inquisitor
who
marks
his
victim
anguish
on
the
rack
and
calculates
his
powers
of
further
endurance
but
he
could
no
longer
dally
even
with
this
horrible
gratification
his
companion
grew
impatient
eleanor
fair
long
tresses
had
escaped
from
their
confinement
in
the
struggle
and
fell
down
her
neck
in
disorder
twining
his
fingers
amidst
its
folds
luke
dragged
her
backwards
from
her
hold
and
incapable
of
further
resistance
her
strength
completely
exhausted
the
wretched
girl
fell
to
the
ground
luke
now
raised
her
almost
inanimate
form
in
his
arms
and
had
nigh
reached
the
aperture
when
a
crash
was
heard
in
the
panel
opposite
to
that
by
which
he
was
about
to
escape
and
communicating
with
a
further
apartment
it
was
thrown
open
and
ranulph
rookwood
presented
himself
at
the
narrow
partition
an
exclamation
of
joy
that
he
was
yet
in
time
escaped
his
lips
and
he
was
about
to
clear
the
partition
at
a
bound
and
to
precipitate
himself
upon
luke
when
as
suddenly
as
his
own
action
was
the
person
of
the
unfortunate
coates
wedged
into
the
aperture
traitor
cried
ranulph
regarding
coates
with
concentrated
fury
dare
you
to
oppose
me
hence
or
by
heaven
i
will
cut
you
down
is
impossible
ejaculated
the
attorney
for
your
own
sake
sir
ranulph
for
my
sake
i
entreat
implore
of
you
not
to
attempt
to
pass
this
way
try
the
other
door
ranulph
said
no
more
he
passed
his
sword
through
the
body
of
the
miserable
attorney
who
with
a
deep
groan
fell
the
only
obstacle
to
his
passage
being
thus
removed
he
at
once
leaped
into
the
room
the
brothers
were
now
confronted
together
but
little
of
brotherly
love
mingled
with
the
glances
which
they
threw
upon
each
other
gentle
but
withal
enthusiastic
temperament
had
kindled
under
his
present
excitement
like
flax
at
the
sudden
approach
of
flame
he
was
wild
with
frenzy
luke
was
calmer
but
his
fury
was
deadly
and
inextinguishable
the
meeting
was
terrible
on
both
sides
with
one
arm
luke
enfolded
eleanor
with
the
other
he
uplifted
the
dagger
its
point
was
towards
her
bosom
scowling
grim
defiance
at
ranulph
he
exclaimed
in
a
determined
tone
advance
a
footstep
and
my
dagger
descends
into
her
heart
ranulph
hesitated
uncertain
how
to
act
foaming
with
rage
yet
trembling
with
apprehension
ranulph
gasped
eleanor
life
without
you
were
valueless
advance
avenge
me
ranulph
still
hesitated
he
could
not
by
any
act
of
his
own
compromise
eleanor
safety
luke
saw
his
advantage
and
was
not
slow
to
profit
by
it
you
seal
her
destruction
if
you
stir
said
he
villain
returned
ranulph
between
his
ground
teeth
and
with
difficulty
commanding
sufficient
coolness
to
speak
with
deliberation
you
perceive
your
power
injure
her
and
nothing
earthly
shall
protect
you
free
her
and
take
your
life
and
liberty
nay
reward
if
you
will
you
can
not
otherwise
escape
me
escape
you
laughed
luke
disdainfully
stand
aside
and
let
me
pass
beware
added
he
sternly
how
you
oppose
me
i
would
not
have
a
brother
blood
upon
my
soul
nor
i
cried
ranulph
but
you
pass
not
and
he
placed
himself
full
in
luke
path
luke
however
steadily
moved
forward
holding
eleanor
between
himself
and
ranulph
so
as
to
shield
his
own
person
but
fancying
he
saw
an
opportunity
of
dealing
a
blow
without
injury
to
his
mistress
the
latter
was
about
to
hazard
the
thrust
when
his
arms
were
seized
behind
and
he
was
rendered
powerless
lost
lost
groaned
he
she
is
lost
to
me
forever
i
fear
that
but
too
true
said
turpin
for
it
was
the
highwayman
whose
grasp
confined
ranulph
must
i
see
her
borne
away
before
my
eyes
cried
ranulph
release
me
set
me
free
quite
impossible
at
present
returned
dick
mount
and
away
sir
luke
continued
he
never
mind
me
leave
me
to
shift
for
myself
eleanor
cried
ranulph
as
she
passed
close
by
his
side
ranulph
shrieked
eleanor
with
a
loud
scream
recalled
to
consciousness
by
his
voice
farewell
for
ever
ay
for
ever
responded
luke
triumphantly
you
meet
no
more
on
earth
he
was
about
to
pass
through
the
panel
when
eleanor
exerted
all
her
remaining
strength
in
a
last
futile
attempt
at
liberation
in
the
struggle
a
packet
fell
from
luke
bosom
handassah
stooped
to
pick
it
up
from
sybil
exclaimed
she
glancing
at
the
superscription
remember
my
promise
to
old
barbara
roared
dick
who
had
some
curiosity
as
the
reader
knows
to
learn
what
the
package
contained
the
time
is
arrived
eleanor
is
in
your
power
in
your
presence
give
me
the
packet
said
luke
resigning
eleanor
for
the
instant
to
handassah
custody
take
the
steel
and
grasp
her
firmly
handassah
who
though
slight
of
figure
was
of
singular
personal
strength
twined
her
arms
about
miss
mowbray
in
such
a
manner
as
to
preclude
all
possibility
of
motion
luke
tore
open
the
package
it
was
a
box
carefully
enclosed
in
several
folds
of
linen
and
lastly
within
a
sheet
of
paper
on
which
were
inscribed
these
words
the
dower
of
sybil
hastily
and
with
much
curiosity
luke
raised
the
lid
of
the
box
it
contained
one
long
silken
tress
of
blackest
hair
enviously
braided
it
was
sybil
his
first
impulse
was
to
cast
it
from
him
his
next
reproachfully
to
raise
it
to
his
lips
he
started
as
if
a
snake
had
stung
him
at
this
moment
a
loud
clamor
was
heard
in
the
gallery
in
the
next
the
door
was
assailed
by
violent
strokes
evidently
proceeding
from
some
weighty
instrument
impelled
by
the
united
strength
of
several
assailants
the
voice
of
turpin
rose
above
the
deafening
din
a
bullet
for
the
first
who
enters
shouted
he
quick
sir
luke
and
the
prize
is
safe
away
and
but
as
he
seconded
his
exhortation
with
a
glance
at
luke
he
broke
off
the
sentence
and
started
with
horror
and
amazement
ere
the
cause
of
his
alarm
could
be
expressed
the
door
was
burst
open
and
a
crowd
of
domestics
headed
by
major
mowbray
and
titus
tyrconnel
rushed
into
the
room
nay
then
the
game
up
exclaimed
dick
i
have
done
with
rookwood
and
springing
through
the
panel
he
was
seen
no
more
when
the
newcomers
first
looked
round
they
could
perceive
only
two
figures
besides
themselves
those
of
the
two
lovers
eleanor
having
sunk
pale
exhausted
and
almost
senseless
into
the
arms
of
ranulph
presently
however
a
ghastly
object
attracted
their
attention
all
rushed
towards
it
all
recoiled
as
soon
as
they
discovered
that
it
was
the
lifeless
body
of
luke
rookwood
his
limbs
were
stiff
like
those
of
a
corpse
which
has
for
hours
been
such
his
eyes
protruded
from
their
sockets
his
face
was
livid
and
blotched
all
bespoke
with
terrible
certainty
the
efficacy
of
the
poison
and
the
full
accomplishment
of
barbara
revenge
handassah
was
gone
probably
she
had
escaped
ere
turpin
fled
at
all
events
she
was
heard
of
no
more
at
rookwood
it
required
little
to
recall
the
senses
of
eleanor
shortly
she
revived
and
as
she
gazed
around
and
became
conscious
of
her
escape
she
uttered
exclamations
of
thanksgiving
and
sank
into
the
embraces
of
her
brother
meanwhile
mowbray
and
small
had
joined
the
assemblage
the
worthy
doctor
had
been
full
of
alarm
but
his
meditated
condolences
were
now
changed
to
congratulations
as
he
heard
the
particulars
of
the
terrible
scene
that
had
occurred
and
of
eleanor
singular
and
almost
providential
deliverance
after
what
has
befallen
madam
said
the
doctor
to
mowbray
slightly
coughing
you
can
no
longer
raise
any
objection
to
a
certain
union
eh
i
will
answer
for
my
mother
in
that
particular
said
major
mowbray
stepping
forward
she
will
answer
for
herself
my
son
said
mowbray
the
match
has
her
full
and
entire
consent
but
to
what
am
i
to
attribute
the
unexpected
happiness
of
your
return
to
a
chain
of
singular
circumstances
replied
the
major
which
i
will
hereafter
detail
to
you
suffice
it
to
say
that
but
for
this
gentleman
fortunate
arrival
added
he
looking
at
titus
tyrconnel
at
the
hut
on
thorne
waste
i
might
have
been
detained
a
prisoner
without
and
what
is
worse
without
provision
perhaps
for
days
and
to
add
to
my
distress
fully
acquainted
with
the
meditated
abduction
of
my
sister
it
was
excessively
lucky
for
me
tyrconnel
that
you
happened
to
pass
that
way
and
for
poor
paterson
likewise
arrah
by
my
sowl
major
and
you
may
say
that
with
safety
and
it
was
particularly
fortunate
that
we
stumbled
upon
the
tits
in
the
cellar
or
we
never
have
been
here
just
in
the
nick
of
it
i
begin
to
think
lost
all
chance
of
taking
dick
turpin
this
time
he
got
clean
away
i
am
not
sorry
for
his
escape
said
the
major
he
a
brave
fellow
and
i
respect
courage
wherever
i
find
it
even
in
a
highwayman
i
should
be
sorry
to
appear
as
a
witness
against
him
and
i
trust
it
will
never
be
my
fate
to
do
so
we
shall
not
pause
to
describe
the
affectionate
meeting
which
now
ensued
between
the
brother
and
sister
the
congratulations
upon
escape
from
peril
intermingled
with
the
tenderest
embraces
and
the
warmest
thanks
offered
to
ranulph
for
his
gallant
service
she
is
yours
my
dear
boy
said
the
major
and
though
you
are
a
rookwood
and
she
bears
the
name
of
eleanor
i
predict
that
contrary
to
the
usual
custom
of
our
families
in
such
cases
all
your
misfortunes
will
have
occurred
marriage
there
is
only
one
thing
said
small
with
a
very
peculiar
expression
which
might
almost
be
construed
into
could
we
suspect
the
benevolent
doctor
of
any
such
waggery
that
can
possibly
throw
a
shade
over
our
present
felicity
lady
rookwood
is
not
to
be
found
my
poor
mother
said
ranulph
starting
make
yourself
easy
said
the
doctor
i
doubt
not
we
shall
hear
of
her
my
only
apprehension
added
he
half
aside
is
that
she
may
be
heard
of
before
one
other
circumstance
afflicts
me
said
ranulph
poor
mr
coates
what
that
you
say
of
coates
sir
ranulph
exclaimed
titus
i
fear
he
was
killed
in
the
recent
affray
said
ranulph
let
some
one
search
for
the
body
kilt
echoed
titus
is
it
kilt
that
coates
is
ah
and
is
it
over
with
him
entirely
is
he
gone
to
rejoin
his
father
the
bring
me
to
his
remains
he
will
bring
them
to
you
himself
said
the
attorney
stepping
forward
luckily
sir
ranulph
said
the
incurable
punster
it
was
merely
the
that
your
sword
passed
through
the
remains
uninjured
so
that
you
did
not
act
as
my
to
eternity
body
o
me
i
as
many
lives
as
a
cat
ha
ha
ranulph
welcomed
the
facetious
man
of
law
with
no
little
satisfaction
we
think
it
unnecessary
to
enter
into
further
detail
another
chamber
was
prepared
for
eleanor
reception
to
which
she
was
almost
immediately
transported
the
remains
of
the
once
fierce
and
haughty
luke
now
stiff
and
stark
but
still
wearing
even
in
death
their
proud
character
were
placed
upon
the
bier
and
covered
with
the
pall
which
but
a
week
ago
had
furnished
forth
his
funeral
and
as
the
domestics
crowded
round
the
corpse
there
was
not
one
of
them
but
commented
upon
his
startling
resemblance
to
his
grandsire
sir
reginald
nor
amongst
the
superstitious
was
the
falling
of
the
fatal
bough
forgotten
tranquillity
was
at
length
restored
at
the
hall
throughout
the
night
and
during
the
next
day
ranulph
made
every
search
for
his
mother
but
no
tidings
could
be
learned
of
her
seriously
alarmed
he
then
caused
more
strict
and
general
inquiry
to
be
instituted
but
with
like
unsuccessful
effect
it
was
not
indeed
till
some
years
afterwards
that
her
fate
was
ascertained
so
now
is
ended
like
an
old
wife
webster
notwithstanding
the
obscurity
which
hung
over
the
fate
of
lady
rookwood
the
celebration
of
the
nuptials
of
sir
ranulph
and
eleanor
was
not
long
delayed
the
ceremony
took
place
at
the
parish
church
and
the
worthy
vicar
officiated
upon
the
occasion
it
was
a
joyous
sight
to
all
who
witnessed
it
and
not
few
were
they
who
did
so
for
the
whole
neighborhood
was
bidden
to
the
festival
the
old
avenue
was
thronged
with
bright
and
beaming
faces
rustic
maidens
decked
out
in
ribbons
of
splendor
and
stout
youths
in
their
best
holiday
trim
nor
was
the
lusty
yeoman
and
his
buxom
spouse
nor
yet
the
patriarch
of
the
village
nor
prattling
child
wanting
even
the
ancestral
rooks
seemed
to
participate
in
the
universal
merriment
and
returned
from
their
eyries
a
hoarse
greeting
like
a
lusty
chorus
of
laughter
to
the
frolic
train
the
churchyard
path
was
strewn
with
flowers
the
church
itself
a
complete
garland
never
was
there
seen
a
blither
wedding
the
sun
smiled
upon
the
bride
accounted
a
fortunate
omen
as
dark
lowering
skies
and
stormy
weather
had
within
the
memory
of
the
oldest
of
the
tenantry
inauspiciously
ushered
in
all
former
espousals
the
bride
had
recovered
her
bloom
and
beauty
while
the
melancholy
which
had
seemingly
settled
for
ever
upon
the
open
brow
of
the
bridegroom
had
now
given
place
to
a
pensive
shade
that
only
added
interest
to
his
expressive
features
and
as
in
simple
state
after
the
completion
of
the
sacred
rites
the
youthful
pair
walked
arm
in
arm
amongst
their
thronging
and
admiring
tenants
towards
the
hall
many
a
fervent
prayer
was
breathed
that
the
curse
of
the
house
of
rookwood
might
be
averted
from
their
heads
and
not
to
leave
a
doubt
upon
the
subject
we
can
add
that
these
aspirations
were
not
in
vain
but
that
the
day
which
dawned
so
brightly
was
one
of
serene
and
unclouded
happiness
to
its
close
after
the
ceremonial
the
day
was
devoted
to
festivity
crowded
with
company
from
the
ample
hall
to
the
kitchen
ingle
the
old
mansion
could
scarce
contain
its
numerous
guests
while
the
walls
resounded
with
hearty
peals
of
laughter
to
which
they
had
been
long
unaccustomed
the
tables
groaned
beneath
the
lordly
baron
of
beef
the
weighty
chine
the
castled
pasty
flanked
on
the
one
hand
with
neat
tongue
and
on
the
other
defended
by
a
mountainous
ham
an
excellent
de
and
every
other
substantial
appliance
of
ancient
hospitality
barrels
of
mighty
ale
were
broached
and
their
contents
widely
distributed
and
the
health
of
the
bride
and
bridegroom
was
enthusiastically
drunk
in
a
brimming
wassail
cup
of
spicy
wine
with
floating
toast
titus
tyrconnel
acted
as
master
of
the
ceremonies
and
was
coates
declared
in
his
so
much
was
he
elated
that
he
ventured
to
cut
some
of
his
old
jokes
upon
the
vicar
and
strange
to
say
without
incurring
the
resentment
of
small
to
retrace
the
darker
course
of
our
narrative
we
must
state
that
some
weeks
before
this
happy
event
the
remains
of
the
unfortunate
sir
luke
rookwood
had
been
gathered
to
those
of
his
fathers
the
document
that
attested
his
legitimacy
being
found
upon
his
person
the
claims
denied
to
him
in
life
were
conceded
in
death
and
he
was
interred
with
all
the
pomp
and
peculiar
solemnity
proper
to
one
of
the
house
within
the
tomb
of
his
ancestry
it
was
then
that
a
discovery
was
made
respecting
alan
rookwood
in
order
to
explain
which
we
must
again
revert
to
the
night
of
the
meditated
of
eleanor
after
quitting
his
grandson
in
the
avenue
alan
shaped
his
course
among
the
fields
in
the
direction
to
the
church
he
sought
his
own
humble
but
now
deserted
dwelling
the
door
had
been
forced
some
of
its
meagre
furniture
was
removed
and
the
dog
his
sole
companion
had
fled
poor
mole
said
he
thou
hast
found
i
trust
a
better
master
and
having
possessed
himself
of
what
he
came
in
search
namely
a
bunch
of
keys
and
his
lantern
deposited
in
an
cupboard
that
had
escaped
notice
he
quickly
departed
he
was
once
more
within
the
churchyard
once
more
upon
that
awful
stage
whereon
he
had
chosen
to
enact
for
a
long
season
his
late
fantastical
character
and
he
gazed
upon
the
church
tower
glistening
in
the
moonshine
the
green
and
undulating
hillocks
the
chequered
the
clustered
headstones
and
the
black
and
portentous
as
upon
old
familiar
faces
he
mused
for
a
few
moments
upon
the
scene
apparently
with
deep
interest
he
then
walked
beneath
the
shadows
of
one
of
the
yews
chanting
an
odd
stanza
or
so
of
one
of
his
wild
staves
wrapped
the
while
it
would
seem
in
affectionate
contemplation
of
the
of
his
song
the
churchyard
yew
metuendaque
succo
taxus
statius
a
noxious
tree
is
the
churchyard
yew
as
if
from
the
dead
its
sap
it
drew
dark
are
its
branches
and
dismal
to
see
like
plumes
at
death
latest
solemnity
spectral
and
jagged
and
black
as
the
wings
which
some
spirit
of
ill
a
sepulchre
flings
oh
a
terrible
tree
is
the
churchyard
yew
like
it
is
nothing
so
grimly
to
view
yet
this
baleful
tree
hath
a
core
so
sound
can
nought
so
tough
in
the
grove
be
found
from
it
were
fashioned
brave
english
bows
the
boast
of
our
isle
and
the
dread
of
its
foes
for
our
sturdy
sires
cut
their
stoutest
staves
from
the
branch
that
hung
their
fathers
graves
and
though
it
be
dreary
and
dismal
to
view
staunch
at
the
heart
is
the
churchyard
yew
his
ditty
concluded
alan
entered
the
churchyard
taking
care
to
leave
the
door
slightly
ajar
in
order
to
facilitate
his
grandson
entrance
for
an
instant
he
lingered
in
the
chancel
the
yellow
moonlight
fell
upon
the
monuments
of
his
race
and
directed
by
the
instinct
of
hate
alan
eye
rested
upon
the
gilded
entablature
of
his
perfidious
brother
reginald
and
muttering
curses
not
loud
but
deep
he
passed
on
having
lighted
his
lantern
in
no
tranquil
mood
he
descended
into
the
vault
observing
a
similar
caution
with
respect
to
the
portal
of
the
cemetery
which
he
left
partially
unclosed
with
the
key
in
the
lock
here
he
resolved
to
abide
luke
coming
the
reader
knows
what
probability
there
was
of
his
expectations
being
realized
for
a
while
he
paced
the
tomb
wrapped
in
gloomy
meditation
and
pondering
it
might
be
upon
the
result
of
luke
expedition
and
the
fulfilment
of
his
own
dark
schemes
scowling
from
time
to
time
beneath
his
bent
eyebrows
counting
the
grim
array
of
coffins
and
noticing
with
something
like
satisfaction
that
the
shell
which
contained
the
remains
of
his
daughter
had
been
restored
to
its
former
position
he
then
bethought
him
of
father
checkley
midnight
intrusion
upon
his
conference
with
luke
and
their
apprehension
of
a
supernatural
visitation
and
his
curiosity
was
stimulated
to
ascertain
by
what
means
the
priest
had
gained
admission
to
the
spot
unperceived
and
unheard
he
resolved
to
sound
the
floor
and
see
whether
any
secret
entrance
existed
and
hollowly
and
dully
did
the
hard
flagging
return
the
stroke
of
his
heel
as
he
pursued
his
scrutiny
at
length
the
metallic
ringing
of
an
iron
plate
immediately
behind
the
marble
effigy
of
sir
ranulph
resolved
the
point
there
it
was
that
the
priest
had
found
access
to
the
vault
but
alan
disappointment
was
excessive
when
he
discovered
that
the
plate
was
fastened
on
the
underside
and
all
communication
thence
with
the
churchyard
or
to
wherever
else
it
might
conduct
him
cut
off
but
the
present
was
not
the
season
for
further
investigation
and
tolerably
pleased
with
the
discovery
he
had
already
made
he
returned
to
his
silent
march
round
the
sepulchre
at
length
a
sound
like
the
sudden
shutting
of
the
church
door
broke
upon
the
profound
stillness
of
the
holy
edifice
in
the
hush
that
succeeded
a
footstep
was
distinctly
heard
threading
the
aisle
he
comes
he
comes
exclaimed
alan
joyfully
adding
an
instant
after
in
an
altered
voice
but
he
comes
alone
the
footstep
drew
near
to
the
mouth
of
the
vault
it
was
upon
the
stairs
alan
stepped
forward
to
greet
as
he
supposed
his
grandson
but
started
back
in
astonishment
and
dismay
as
he
encountered
in
his
stead
lady
rookwood
alan
retreated
while
the
lady
advanced
swinging
the
iron
door
after
her
which
closed
with
a
tremendous
clang
approaching
the
statue
of
the
first
sir
ranulph
she
paused
and
alan
then
remarked
the
singular
and
terrible
expression
of
her
eyes
which
appeared
to
be
fixed
upon
the
statue
or
upon
some
invisible
object
near
it
there
was
something
in
her
whole
attitude
and
manner
calculated
to
impress
the
deepest
terror
on
the
beholder
and
alan
gazed
upon
her
with
an
awe
which
momently
increased
lady
rookwood
bearing
was
as
proud
and
erect
as
we
have
formerly
described
it
to
have
been
her
brow
was
haughtily
bent
her
chiselled
lip
as
disdainfully
curled
but
the
staring
changeless
eye
and
the
sob
which
occasionally
escaped
her
betrayed
how
much
she
was
under
the
influence
of
mortal
terror
alan
watched
her
in
amazement
he
knew
not
how
the
scene
was
likely
to
terminate
nor
what
could
have
induced
her
to
visit
this
ghostly
spot
at
such
an
hour
and
alone
but
he
resolved
to
abide
the
issue
in
silence
profound
as
her
own
after
a
time
however
his
impatience
got
the
better
of
his
fears
and
scruples
and
he
spoke
what
doth
lady
rookwood
in
the
abode
of
the
dead
asked
he
at
length
she
started
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
but
still
kept
her
eye
fixed
upon
the
vacancy
hast
thou
not
beckoned
me
hither
and
am
i
not
come
returned
she
in
a
hollow
tone
and
now
thou
asketh
wherefore
i
am
here
i
am
here
because
as
in
thy
life
i
feared
thee
not
neither
in
death
do
i
fear
thee
i
am
here
because
what
seest
thou
interrupted
peter
with
terror
what
see
i
ha
ha
shouted
lady
rookwood
amidst
discordant
laughter
that
which
might
appal
a
heart
less
stout
than
mine
a
figure
with
veins
that
glow
as
with
a
subtle
and
consuming
flame
a
substance
yet
a
shadow
in
thy
living
likeness
ha
frown
if
thou
wilt
i
can
return
thy
glances
where
dost
thou
see
this
vision
demanded
alan
where
echoed
lady
rookwood
becoming
for
the
first
time
sensible
of
the
presence
of
a
stranger
ha
who
are
you
that
question
me
what
are
you
speak
no
matter
who
or
what
i
am
returned
alan
i
ask
you
what
you
behold
can
you
see
nothing
nothing
replied
alan
you
knew
sir
piers
rookwood
is
it
he
asked
alan
drawing
near
her
it
is
replied
lady
rookwood
i
have
followed
him
hither
and
i
will
follow
him
whithersoever
he
leads
me
were
it
to
what
doth
he
now
asked
alan
do
you
see
him
still
the
figure
points
to
that
sarcophagus
returned
lady
rookwood
can
you
raise
up
the
lid
no
replied
alan
my
strength
will
not
avail
to
lift
it
yet
let
the
trial
be
made
said
lady
rookwood
the
figure
points
there
still
my
own
arm
shall
aid
you
alan
watched
her
in
dumb
wonder
she
advanced
towards
the
marble
monument
and
beckoned
him
to
follow
he
reluctantly
complied
without
any
expectation
of
being
able
to
move
the
ponderous
lid
of
the
sarcophagus
at
lady
rookwood
renewed
request
he
applied
himself
to
the
task
what
was
his
surprise
when
beneath
their
united
efforts
he
found
the
ponderous
slab
slowly
revolve
upon
its
vast
hinges
and
with
little
further
difficulty
it
was
completely
elevated
though
it
still
required
the
exertion
of
all
alan
strength
to
prop
it
open
and
prevent
its
falling
back
what
does
it
contain
asked
lady
rookwood
a
warrior
ashes
returned
alan
there
is
a
rusty
dagger
upon
a
fold
of
faded
linen
cried
lady
rookwood
holding
down
the
light
it
is
the
weapon
with
which
the
first
dame
of
the
house
of
rookwood
was
stabbed
said
alan
with
a
grim
smile
which
whoso
findeth
in
the
tomb
shall
clutch
until
the
hour
of
doom
and
when
is
grasped
by
hand
of
clay
the
curse
of
blood
shall
pass
away
so
saith
the
rhyme
have
you
seen
enough
no
said
lady
rookwood
precipitating
herself
into
the
marble
coffin
that
weapon
shall
be
mine
come
forth
come
forth
cried
alan
my
arm
trembles
i
can
not
support
the
lid
i
will
have
it
though
i
grasp
it
to
eternity
shrieked
lady
rookwood
vainly
endeavoring
to
wrest
away
the
dagger
which
was
fastened
together
with
the
linen
upon
which
it
lay
by
some
adhesive
substance
to
the
bottom
of
the
shell
at
this
moment
alan
rookwood
happened
to
cast
his
eye
upward
and
he
then
beheld
what
filled
him
with
new
terror
the
axe
of
the
sable
statue
was
poised
above
its
head
as
in
the
act
to
strike
him
some
secret
machinery
it
was
evident
existed
between
the
sarcophagus
lid
and
this
mysterious
image
but
in
the
first
impulse
of
his
alarm
alan
abandoned
his
hold
of
the
slab
and
it
sunk
slowly
downwards
he
uttered
a
loud
cry
as
it
moved
lady
rookwood
heard
this
cry
she
raised
herself
at
the
same
moment
the
dagger
was
in
her
hand
she
pressed
it
against
the
lid
but
its
downward
force
was
too
great
to
be
withstood
the
light
was
within
the
sarcophagus
and
alan
could
discern
her
features
the
expression
was
terrible
she
uttered
one
shriek
and
the
lid
closed
for
ever
alan
was
in
total
darkness
the
light
had
been
enclosed
with
lady
rookwood
there
was
something
so
horrible
in
her
probable
fate
that
even
shuddered
as
he
thought
upon
it
exerting
all
his
remaining
strength
he
essayed
to
raise
the
lid
but
now
it
was
more
firmly
closed
than
ever
it
defied
all
his
power
once
for
an
instant
he
fancied
that
it
yielded
to
his
straining
sinews
but
it
was
only
his
hand
that
slided
upon
the
surface
of
the
marble
it
was
fixed
immovable
the
sides
and
lid
rang
with
the
strokes
which
the
unfortunate
lady
bestowed
upon
them
with
the
dagger
point
but
those
sounds
were
not
long
heard
presently
all
was
still
the
marble
ceased
to
vibrate
with
her
blows
alan
struck
the
lid
with
his
knuckles
but
no
response
was
returned
all
was
silent
he
now
turned
his
attention
to
his
own
situation
which
had
become
sufficiently
alarming
an
hour
must
have
elapsed
yet
luke
had
not
arrived
the
door
of
the
vault
was
closed
the
key
was
in
the
lock
and
on
the
outside
he
was
himself
a
prisoner
within
the
tomb
what
if
luke
should
return
what
if
he
were
slain
as
it
might
chance
in
the
enterprise
that
thought
flashed
across
his
brain
like
an
electric
shock
none
knew
of
his
retreat
but
his
grandson
he
might
perish
of
famine
within
this
desolate
vault
he
checked
this
notion
as
soon
as
it
was
formed
it
was
too
dreadful
to
be
indulged
in
a
thousand
circumstances
might
conspire
to
detain
luke
he
was
sure
to
come
yet
the
solitude
the
darkness
was
awful
almost
intolerable
the
dying
and
the
dead
were
around
him
he
dared
not
stir
another
hour
an
age
it
seemed
to
him
had
passed
still
luke
came
not
horrible
forebodings
crossed
him
but
he
would
not
surrender
himself
to
them
he
rose
and
crawled
in
the
direction
as
he
supposed
of
the
door
fearful
even
of
the
stealthy
sound
of
his
own
footsteps
he
reached
it
and
his
heart
once
more
throbbed
with
hope
he
bent
his
ear
to
the
key
he
drew
in
his
breath
he
listened
for
some
sound
but
nothing
was
to
be
heard
a
groan
would
have
been
almost
music
in
his
ears
another
hour
was
gone
he
was
now
a
prey
to
the
most
frightful
apprehensions
agitated
in
turns
by
the
wildest
emotions
of
rage
and
terror
he
at
one
moment
imagined
that
luke
had
abandoned
him
and
heaped
curses
upon
his
head
at
the
next
convinced
that
he
had
fallen
he
bewailed
with
equal
bitterness
his
grandson
fate
and
his
own
he
paced
the
tomb
like
one
distracted
he
stamped
upon
the
iron
plate
he
smote
with
his
hands
upon
the
door
he
shouted
and
the
vault
hollowly
echoed
his
lamentations
but
time
sand
ran
on
and
luke
arrived
not
alan
now
abandoned
himself
wholly
to
despair
he
could
no
longer
anticipate
his
grandson
coming
no
longer
hope
for
deliverance
his
fate
was
sealed
death
awaited
him
he
must
anticipate
his
slow
but
inevitable
stroke
enduring
all
the
grinding
horrors
of
starvation
the
contemplation
of
such
an
end
was
madness
but
he
was
forced
to
contemplate
it
now
and
so
appalling
did
it
appear
to
his
imagination
that
he
half
resolved
to
dash
out
his
brains
against
the
walls
of
the
sepulchre
and
put
an
end
at
once
to
his
tortures
and
nothing
except
a
doubt
whether
he
might
not
by
imperfectly
accomplishing
his
purpose
increase
his
own
suffering
prevented
him
from
putting
this
dreadful
idea
into
execution
his
dagger
was
gone
and
he
had
no
other
weapon
terrors
of
a
new
kind
now
assailed
him
the
dead
he
fancied
were
bursting
from
their
coffins
and
he
peopled
the
darkness
with
grisly
phantoms
they
were
around
about
him
on
each
side
whirling
and
rustling
gibbering
groaning
shrieking
laughing
and
lamenting
he
was
stunned
stifled
the
air
seemed
to
grow
suffocating
pestilential
the
wild
laughter
was
redoubled
the
horrible
troop
assailed
him
they
dragged
him
along
the
tomb
and
amid
their
howls
he
fell
and
became
insensible
when
he
returned
to
himself
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
collect
his
scattered
faculties
and
when
the
agonizing
consciousness
of
his
terrible
situation
forced
itself
upon
his
mind
he
had
nigh
relapsed
into
oblivion
he
arose
he
rushed
towards
the
door
he
knocked
against
it
with
his
knuckles
till
the
blood
streamed
from
them
he
scratched
against
it
with
his
nails
till
they
were
torn
off
by
the
roots
with
insane
fury
he
hurled
himself
against
the
iron
frame
it
was
in
vain
again
he
had
recourse
to
the
he
searched
for
it
he
found
it
he
laid
himself
upon
the
ground
there
was
no
interval
of
space
in
which
he
could
insert
a
finger
point
he
beat
it
with
his
clenched
hand
he
tore
it
with
his
teeth
he
jumped
upon
it
he
smote
it
with
his
heel
the
iron
returned
a
sullen
sound
he
again
essayed
the
lid
of
the
sarcophagus
despair
nerved
his
strength
he
raised
the
slab
a
few
inches
he
shouted
screamed
but
no
answer
was
returned
and
again
the
lid
fell
she
is
dead
cried
alan
why
have
i
not
shared
her
fate
but
mine
is
to
come
and
such
a
death
oh
oh
and
frenzied
at
the
thought
he
again
hurried
to
the
door
and
renewed
his
fruitless
attempts
to
escape
till
nature
gave
way
and
he
sank
upon
the
floor
groaning
and
exhausted
physical
suffering
now
began
to
take
the
place
of
his
mental
tortures
parched
and
consumed
with
a
fierce
internal
fever
he
was
tormented
by
unappeasable
thirst
of
all
human
ills
the
most
unendurable
his
tongue
was
dry
and
dusty
his
throat
inflamed
his
lips
had
lost
all
moisture
he
licked
the
humid
floor
he
sought
to
imbibe
the
nitrous
drops
from
the
walls
but
instead
of
allaying
his
thirst
they
increased
it
he
would
have
given
the
world
had
he
possessed
it
for
a
draught
of
cold
oh
to
have
died
with
his
lips
upon
some
bubbling
fountain
marge
but
to
perish
thus
nor
were
the
pangs
of
hunger
wanting
he
had
to
endure
all
the
horrors
of
famine
as
well
as
the
agonies
of
quenchless
thirst
in
this
dreadful
state
three
days
and
nights
passed
over
alan
fated
head
nor
night
nor
day
had
he
time
with
him
was
only
measured
by
its
duration
and
that
seemed
interminable
each
hour
added
to
his
suffering
and
brought
with
it
no
relief
during
this
period
of
prolonged
misery
reason
often
tottered
on
her
throne
sometimes
he
was
under
the
influence
of
the
wildest
passions
he
dragged
coffins
from
their
recesses
hurled
them
upon
the
ground
striving
to
break
them
open
and
drag
forth
their
loathsome
contents
upon
other
occasions
he
would
weep
bitterly
and
wildly
and
once
only
once
did
he
attempt
to
pray
but
he
started
from
his
knees
with
an
echo
of
infernal
laughter
as
he
deemed
ringing
in
his
ears
then
again
would
he
call
down
imprecations
upon
himself
and
his
whole
line
trampling
upon
the
pile
of
coffins
he
had
reared
and
lastly
more
subdued
would
creep
to
the
boards
that
contained
the
body
of
his
child
kissing
them
with
a
frantic
outbreak
of
affection
at
length
he
became
sensible
of
his
approaching
dissolution
to
him
the
thought
of
death
might
well
be
terrible
but
he
quailed
not
before
it
or
rather
seemed
in
his
latest
moments
to
resume
all
his
wonted
firmness
of
character
gathering
together
his
remaining
strength
he
dragged
himself
towards
the
niche
wherein
his
brother
sir
reginald
rookwood
was
deposited
and
placing
his
hand
upon
the
coffin
solemnly
exclaimed
my
curse
my
dying
curse
be
upon
thee
evermore
falling
with
his
face
upon
the
coffin
alan
instantly
expired
in
this
attitude
his
remains
were
discovered
our
tale
is
told
yet
perhaps
we
may
be
allowed
to
add
a
few
words
respecting
two
of
the
subordinate
characters
of
our
drama
melodrama
we
ought
to
say
namely
jerry
juniper
and
the
knight
of
malta
what
became
of
the
caper
merchant
son
after
his
flight
from
kilburn
wells
we
have
never
been
able
distinctly
to
ascertain
juniper
however
would
seem
to
be
a
sort
of
wandering
jew
for
certain
it
is
that
very
like
is
extant
still
and
to
be
met
with
at
jerry
old
haunts
indeed
we
have
no
doubt
of
encountering
him
at
the
ensuing
meetings
of
ascot
and
hampton
as
regards
the
knight
of
malta
knight
of
rhodes
he
should
have
been
we
are
sorry
to
state
that
the
career
of
the
ruffler
terminated
in
a
madhouse
and
thus
the
poor
knight
became
in
reality
a
according
to
the
custom
observed
in
those
establishments
the
knight
was
deprived
of
his
luxuriant
locks
and
the
loss
of
his
beard
rendered
his
case
incurable
but
in
the
mean
time
the
barber
of
the
place
made
his
fortune
by
retailing
the
materials
of
all
the
black
wigs
he
could
collect
to
the
impostor
dupes
such
is
the
latest
piece
of
intelligence
that
has
reached
us
of
the
of
canterbury
turpin
why
disguise
it
was
hanged
at
york
in
his
firmness
deserted
him
not
at
the
last
when
he
mounted
the
fatal
tree
his
left
leg
trembled
he
stamped
it
impatiently
down
and
after
a
brief
chat
with
the
hangman
threw
himself
suddenly
and
resolutely
from
the
ladder
his
sufferings
would
appear
to
have
been
slight
as
he
himself
sang
he
died
not
as
other
men
by
but
without
wincing
and
quite
at
his
ease
we
may
in
some
other
place
lay
before
the
reader
the
particulars
and
they
are
not
incurious
of
the
night
before
larry
was
stretched
the
remains
of
the
vagrant
highwayman
found
a
final
in
the
desecrated
churchyard
of
saint
george
without
the
fishergate
postern
a
green
and
grassy
cemetery
but
withal
a
melancholy
one
a
few
recent
tombs
mark
out
the
spots
where
some
of
the
victims
of
the
pestilence
of
have
been
interred
but
we
have
made
vain
search
for
grave
unless
as
is
more
than
probable
the
plain
stone
with
the
simple
initials
belongs
to
him
the
gyves
by
which
he
was
fettered
are
still
shown
at
york
castle
and
are
of
prodigious
weight
and
strength
and
though
the
herculean
robber
is
said
to
have
moved
in
them
with
ease
the
present
turnkey
was
scarcely
able
to
lift
the
ponderous
irons
an
old
woman
of
the
same
city
has
a
lock
of
hair

we
shall
perhaps
be
accused
of
dilating
too
much
upon
the
character
of
the
highwayman
and
we
plead
guilty
to
the
charge
but
we
found
it
impossible
to
avoid
running
a
little
into
extremes
our
earliest
associations
are
connected
with
sunny
scenes
in
cheshire
said
to
have
been
haunted
by
turpin
and
with
one
very
dear
to
us
from
whose
lips
now
alas
silent
we
have
listened
to
many
stories
of
his
exploits
he
was
a
sort
of
hero
we
have
had
a
singular
delight
in
recounting
his
feats
and
hairbreadth
escapes
and
if
the
reader
derives
only
half
as
much
pleasure
from
the
perusal
of
his
adventures
as
we
have
had
in
narrating
them
our
satisfaction
will
be
complete
perhaps
we
may
have
placed
him
in
too
favorable
a
point
of
view
and
yet
we
know
not
as
upon
those
of
more
important
personages
many
doubts
rest
upon
his
history
such
as
we
conceive
him
to
have
been
we
have
drawn
him
hoping
that
the
benevolent
reader
upon
finishing
our
tale
will
arrive
at
the
same
conclusion

not

in

was
thomas

the
reason
of
his
does
not
appear
he
was
not
particularly
scrupulous
as
to
his
mode
of
appropriation
one
of
his
sayings
is
however
on
record
he
told
a

he
robbed
that
the

of

woman
husband
begins
in

but
the
end
of

he

word

as
here
applied
must
not
be
confounded
with
the
term
of

distinction
now
in
general
use
in
the
political
world
it
simply
means
a
thief
on
a
grand
scale
something
more
than
a
of
unconsidered
trifles
or
rascal
we
have

redmond
was

of
which
are

curious
would
furnish
as
rich
for
the
novelist
as
they
have
already
done
for
the
some
of
them
are
however
sufficiently
well
narrated
in
a
pleasant
little
tome
published
at

entitled
history
of

we
are
also
in
possession
of
a
funeral
discourse
preached
at
the
obsequies
of
the
noble
and
renowned
henry
john
who
was
unfortunately
killed
by
the
the
of
those
days
in
the
induction
to
which
we
find
some
allusion
to
redmond
after
describing
the
thriving
condition
of
the
north
of
ireland
about
the
rev
lawrence
power
the
author
of
the
sermon
says
one
mischief
there
was
which
indeed
in
a
great
measure
destroyed
all
and
that
was
a
pack
of
insolent
bloody
outlaws
whom
they
here
call
these
had
so
riveted
themselves
in
these
parts
that
by
the
interest
they
had
among
the
natives
and
some
english
too
their
shame
be
it
they
exercise
a
kind
of
separate
sovereignty
in
three
or
four
counties
in
the
north
of
ireland
redmond
is
their
chief
and
has
been
these
many
years
a
cunning
dangerous
fellow
who
though
proclaimed
an
outlaw
with
the
rest
of
his
crew
and
sums
of
money
set
upon
their
heads
yet
he
reigns
still
and
keeps
all
in
subjection
so
far
that
credibly
reported
raises
more
in
a
year
by
contributions
de
france
than
the
king
land
taxes
and
come
to
and
thereby
is
enabled
to
bribe
clerks
and
if
not
their
masters
makes
all
too
much
truckle
to
agitation
it
seems
was
not
confined
to
our
own
days
but
the
finest
country
in
the
world
has
been
and
ever
will
be
the
same
the
old
game
is
played
under
a
new
color
the
only
difference
being
that
had
redmond
lived
in
our
time
he
would
in
all
probability
not
only
have
pillaged
a
county
but
it
in
parliament
the
spirit
of
the
rapparee
is
still
abroad
though
we
fear
there
is
little
of
the
left
about
it
we
recommend
this
note
to
the
serious
consideration
of
the
declaimers
against
the
sufferings
of
the
six
millions
here
titus
was
slightly

eminent
a
and
would
have
made
great
proficiency
in
learning
if
he
had
rightly
applied
his
time
he
composed
several
songs
and
put
tunes
to
them
and
by
his
skill
in
music
gained
the
favor
of
some
of
the
leading
musicians
in
the
country
who
endeavored
to
get
him
reprieved
of
the
the
particulars
of
the
execution
are
singular
when
he
was
brought
into
court
to
receive
sentence
of
death
the
judge
told
him
that
he
was
informed
he
should
say
there
was
not
a
rope
in
ireland
sufficient
to
hang
him
but
says
he
try
if
kilkenny
afford
one
strong
enough
to
do
your
business
and
if
that
will
not
do
you
shall
have
another
and
another
then
he
ordered
the
sheriff
to
choose
a
rope
and
delany
was
ordered
for
execution
the
next
day
the
sheriff
having
notice
of
his
mother
boasting
that
no
rope
could
hang
her
son
and
pursuant
to
the
judge
desire
provided
two
ropes
but
delany
broke
them
one
after
the
other
the
sheriff
was
then
in
a
rage
and
went
for
three
which
he
plaited
threefold
together
they
did
his
yet
the
sheriff
was
afraid
he
was
not
dead
and
in
a
passion
to
make
trial
stabbed
him
with
his
sword
in
the
soles
of
his
feet
and
at
last
cut
the
rope
after
he
was
cut
down
his
body
was
carried
into
the
courthouse
where
it
remained
in
the
coffin
for
two
days
standing
up
till
the
judge
and
all
the
spectators
were
fully
satisfied
that
he
was
stiff
and
dead
and
then
permission
was
given
to
his
friends
to
remove
the
corpse
and
bury

this

extraordinary
individual
who
in
the
lucid
intervals
of
a
understanding
imposed
himself
upon
the
credulous
inhabitants
of
canterbury
in
the
year
as
a
certain
sir
william
percy
honeywood
courtenay
knight
of
malta
and
contrived
for
there
was
considerable
method
in
his
madness
to
support
the
deception
during
a
long
period
the
anachronism
of
his
character
in
a
tale
the
data
of
which
is
nearly
a
century
back
will
perhaps
be
overlooked
when
it
is
considered
of
how
much
value
in
the
illustration
of
wise
saws
are
imposture
and
credulity
are
of
all
ages
and
the
courtenays
of
the
nineteenth
are
rivalled
by
the
tofts
and
andrés
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
subjoined
account
of
the
sir
william
courtenay
is
extracted
from
an
essay
on
his
character
and
reflections
on
his
trial
published
at
the
theatre
of
his
exploits
about
michaelmas
last
it
was
rumored
that
an
extraordinary
man
was
staying
at
the
rose
inn
of
this
city
canterbury
who
passed
under
the
name
of
count
rothschild
but
had
been
recently
known
in
london
by
the
name
of
thompson
this
would
have
been
sufficient
to
excite
attention
had
no
other
incidents
materially
added
to
the
excitement
his
costume
and
countenance
denoted
foreign
extraction
while
his
language
and
conversation
showed
that
he
was
well
acquainted
with
almost
every
part
of
this
kingdom
he
was
said
to
live
with
singular
frugality
notwithstanding
abundant
samples
of
wealth
and
professions
of
an
almost
unlimited
command
of
money
he
appeared
to
study
retirement
if
not
concealment
although
subsequent
events
have
proved
that
society
of
every
grade
beneath
the
middle
class
is
the
element
in
which
he
most
freely
breathes
often
decked
his
person
with
a
fine
suit
of
italian
clothing
and
sometimes
with
the
more
gay
and
imposing
costume
of
the
eastern
nations
yet
these
foreign
habits
were
for
months
scarcely
visible
beyond
the
limits
of
the
inn
of
his
abode
and
the
chapel
not
far
from
it
in
which
he
was
accustomed
to
offer
his
sabbath
this
place
was
the
first
to
which
he
made
a
public
and
frequent
resort
and
though
he
did
not
always
attempt
to
advance
towards
the
uppermost
seat
in
the
synagogue
he
attracted
attention
from
the
mere
singularity
of
his
appearance
such
was
the
eccentric
incongruous
individual
who
surprised
our
city
by
proposing
himself
as
a
third
candidate
for
its
representation
and
who
created
an
entertaining
contest
for
the
honor
long
after
the
sitting
candidates
had
composed
themselves
to
the
delightful
vision
of
an
inexpensive
and
unopposed
return
the
notion
of
representing
the
city
originated
beyond
all
doubt
in
the
fertile
brain
of
the
man
himself
it
would
seem
to
have
been
almost
as
sudden
a
thought
in
his
mind
as
it
was
a
sudden
and
surprising
movement
in
the
view
of
the
city
nor
have
we
been
able
to
ascertain
whether
his
sojourn
at
the
rose
was
the
cause
or
the
effect
of
his
offering
to
advocate
our
interests
in
parliament
whether
he
came
to
the
city
with
that
purpose
or
subsequently
formed
the
notion
when
he
saw
or
thought
he
saw
an
opening
for
a
stranger
of
enterprise
like
himself
as
the
county
election
drew
on
we
believe
between
the
nomination
on
barham
downs
and
the
voting
in
the
cattle
market
of
the
city
the
draught
of
a
certain
handbill
was
sent
to
a
printer
of
this
city
with
a
request
that
he
would
publish
it
without
delay
our
readers
will
not
be
surprised
that
he
instantly
declined
the
task
but
as
we
have
obtained
possession
of
the
copy
and
its
publication
can
now
do
no
injury
to
any
one
we
entertain
them
with
a
sight
of
this
delectable
sample
of
courtenay
prudence
and
politeness
yes

four
cowards
unfit
to

in

place
kent
and
knight
of

gentleman
desiring
to
know
the
reasons
why
lord
courtenay
so
publicly
exposes
backbiters
any
man
of
honor
shall
have
satisfaction
at
his
hands
and
in
a
public
way
according
to
the
laws
of
our
land
trial
by
combat
when
the
almighty
god
the
lord
of
hosts
is
his
name
can
decide
the
truth
whether
it
is
a
libel
or
not
i
worship
truth
as
my
god
and
will
die
for
it
and
upon
this
we
will
see
who
is
strongest
god
or
man
it
is
a
coincidence
too
curious
to
be
overlooked
that
this
doughty
champion
of
should
so
soon
have
removed
himself
from
public
life
by
an
act
of
deliberate
and
wanton
perjury
we
never
read
any
of
his
rhapsodies
periodical
or
occasional
till
the
publication
of
this
essay
imposed
the
task
upon
us
but
now
we
find
that
they
abound
in
strong
and
solemn
appeals
to
the
in
bold
proclamations
that
is
his
palladium
in
evidences
that
he
writes
and
raves
that
he
draws
his
sword
and
clenches
his
fist
that
he
expends
his
property
and
the
property
of
others
committed
to
his
hands
in
no
cause
but
that
of
his
famous
periodical
contains
much
vehement
declamation
in
defence
of
certain
doctrines
of
religion
which
he
terms
the
truth
of
the
sublime
system
of
christianity
and
for
which
alone
he
is
content
to
live
and
also
willing
to
die
all
who
deviate
from
his
standard
of
truth
whether
theological
or
moral
philosophical
or
political
he
appears
to
consider
as
neither
fit
for
life
nor
death
now
it
is
a
little
strange
his
warmest
followers
being
witness
that
such
an
advocate
of
truth
should
have
become
the
willing
victim
of
falsehood
the
ready
and
eager
martyr
of
the
worst
form
of
falsehood
perjury
the
decline
of
his
influence
between
the
city
and
county
elections
has
been
partly
attributed
and
not
without
reason
to
the
sudden
change
in
his
appearance
from
comparative
youth
to
advancing
if
not
extreme
age
the
hustings
of
the
city
he
shone
forth
in
all
the
dazzling
lustre
of
an
oriental
chief
and
such
was
the
effect
of
gay
clothing
on
the
meridian
of
life
that
his
admirers
especially
of
the
weaker
sex
would
insist
upon
it
that
he
had
not
passed
the
beautiful
of
may
there
were
indeed
some
suspicious
appearances
of
a
near
approach
to
forty
if
not
two
or
three
years
beyond
it
but
these
were
fondly
ascribed
to
his
foreign
travels
in
distant
and
insalubrious
climes
he
had
acquired
his
duskiness
of
complexion
and
his
strength
of
feature
and
violence
of
gesture
and
his
profusion
of
beard
in
egypt
and
syria
in
exploring
the
catacombs
of
the
one
country
and
bowing
at
the
shrines
of
the
other
on
the
other
hand
the
brilliancy
of
his
eye
the
melody
of
his
voice
and
the
elasticity
of
his
muscles
and
limbs
were
sufficient
arguments
in
favor
of
his
having
scarcely
passed
the
limit
that
separates
manhood
from
all
doubts
on
these
points
were
removed
when
the
crowd
of
his
fair
admirers
visited
him
at
the
retirement
of
his
inn
and
the
intervals
of
his
polling
these
interviews
we
allude
to
the
name
of
the
inn
and
not
to
anything
like
privacy
there
which
the
very
place
and
number
of
the
visitors
altogether
precluded
convinced
them
that
he
was
even
a
younger
and
lovelier
man
than
his
rather
boisterous
behavior
in
the
hall
would
allow
them
to
hope
in
fact
he
was
now
installed
by
acclamation
of
canterbury
as
well
as
malta
and
king
of
kent
as
well
as
it
became
dangerous
then
to
whisper
a
syllable
of
suspicion
against
his
wealth
or
rank
his
wisdom
or
beauty
and
all
who
would
not
bow
down
before
this
golden
image
were
deemed
worthy
of
no
better
fate
than
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
to
be
cast
into
a
burning
fiery
furnace
as
a
sequel
to
the
above
story
it
may
be
added
that
the
knight
of
malta
became
the
inmate
of
a
lunatic
asylum
and
on
his
liberation
was
shot
at
the
head
of
a
band
of
kentish
hinds
whom
he
had
persuaded
that
he
was
the
messiah
a
pipe
of
tobacco
a
drink
composed
of
beer
eggs
and
brandy
the
supposed
malignant
influence
of
this
plant
is
frequently
alluded
to
by
our
elder
dramatists
and
with
one
of
the
greatest
of
them
webster
as
might
be
expected
from
a
muse
revelling
like
a
ghoul
in
graves
and
sepulchres
it
is
an
especial
favorite
but
none
have
plunged
so
deeply
into
the
subject
as
sir
thomas
browne
he
tears
up
the
fable
root
and
branch
concerning
the
danger
ensuing
from
eradication
of
the
mandrake
the
learned
physician
thus
writes
the
last
assertion
is
that
there
follows
a
hazard
of
life
to
them
that
pull
it
up
that
some
evil
fate
pursues
them
and
that
they
live
not
very
long
hereafter
therefore
the
attempt
hereof
among
the
ancients
was
not
in
ordinary
way
but
as
pliny
informeth
when
they
intended
to
take
up
the
root
of
this
plant
they
took
the
wind
thereof
and
with
a
sword
describing
three
circles
about
it
they
digged
it
up
looking
toward
the
west
a
conceit
not
only
injurious
unto
truth
and
confutable
by
daily
experience
but
somewhat
derogatory
unto
the
providence
of
god
that
is
not
only
to
impose
so
destructive
a
quality
on
any
plant
but
to
conceive
a
vegetable
whose
parts
are
so
useful
unto
many
should
in
the
only
taking
up
prove
mortal
unto
any
this
were
to
introduce
a
second
forbidden
fruit
and
enhance
the
first
malediction
making
it
not
only
mortal
for
adam
to
taste
the
one
but
capital
for
his
posterity
to
eradicate
or
dig
up
the
other

for

it
is
matter
of
regret

not
to
