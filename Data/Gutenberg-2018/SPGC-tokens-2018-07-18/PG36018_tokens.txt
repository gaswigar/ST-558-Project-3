i
leaving
home
leaving
home
to
go
to
boarding
school
was
bad
enough
but
leaving
on
a
damp
cold
morning
before
dawn
seemed
to
be
about
the
worst
thing
that
could
befall
a
girl
of
fifteen
i
have
noticed
that
whatever
age
you
happen
to
be
seems
to
be
the
age
in
which
hardships
are
the
most
difficult
to
bear
anyhow
there
i
was
only
fifteen
facing
the
necessity
of
saying
early
morning
farewells
the
first
one
of
all
to
my
comfortable
bed
where
i
had
slept
off
and
on
principally
on
for
those
fifteen
years
and
now
i
and
my
bed
must
part
day
done
miss

the
doctor

stirrin
an
you

shine
and
kind
old
mammy
susan
leaned
yearningly
over
me
i
hate
to
wake
up
my
lamb
i
knowd
dis
day

far

i
jumped
out
of
bed
and
pulled
my
into
the
middle
of
the
floor
ready
for
my
daily
cold
sponge
bath
probably
i
had
inherited
the
habit
of
the
cold
bath
from
my
english
grandfather
along
with
the
big
law
chile
ca

and
i
had
had
this
discussion
about
my
cold
bath
every
morning
since
i
had
been
old
enough
to
bathe
myself
it
was
only
after
many
battles
that
she
had
stopped
sneaking
warm
water
into
my
big
can
that
morning
i
let
it
pass
although
the
water
was
lukewarm
mad
wif
yo
ole
mammy

lan

miss
page
do
you
let
be
drawed
down
inter
none
er
dem
pipes
and
mammy
susan
hurried
off
to
bring
in
the
all
too
early
breakfast
i
dressed
in
my
usual
haste
putting
on
my
nice
blue
traveling
suit
ordered
by
mail
from
new
york
it
was
quite
long
well
down
to
my
shoe
tops
and
i
felt
very
stylish
and
i
had
never
given
any
thought
to
my
appearance
and
no
one
else
in
my
life
seemed
to
have
except
cousin
sue
lee
and
mammy
i
do
know
just
what
cousin
sue
thought
about
me
but
mammy
thought
i
was
the
most
beautiful
creature
in
the
world
and
freely
told
me
so
that
morning
as
i
put
on
the
little
black
velvet
toque
also
purchased
by
mail
i
looked
at
myself
very
critically
in
the
mirror
page
allison
are
you
pretty
or
not
i
for
one
think
not
you
got
freckles
on
your
nose
and
your
mouth
is
simply
huge
i
like
to
say
something
about
your
eyes
to
take
the
conceit
out
of
you
but
they
look
so
like
father
that
i
feel
just
like
i
was
sassing
him
if
i
did
anyhow
i
glad
your
hair
curls
i
had
intended
to
sentimentalize
over
leaving
my
room
and
going
out
into
the
world
but
i
forgot
all
about
it
and
grabbing
my
suitcase
also
a
mail
order
i
raced
downstairs
as
mammy
susan
rang
the
breakfast
bell
father
was
already
in
the
standing
with
his
back
to
the
little
wood
fire
that
mammy
had
kindled
to
cheer
us
up
with
mammy
always
seemed
to
feel
that
when
we
were
in
any
distress
she
must
warm
us
and
feed
us
whether
we
were
cold
and
hungry
or
not
that
morning
we
were
neither
but
we
warmed
by
her
fire
and
tried
to
choke
down
a
great
deal
of
her
batter
bread
and
roe
herring
to
show
her
we
appreciated
her
efforts
father
looked
up
as
i
came
in
and
for
a
moment
regarded
me
in
speechless
amazement
why
honey
you
almost
took
my
breath
away
you
look
so
in
the
new
dress
and
hat
i
did
know
you
were
so
like
your
mother
child
and
he
drew
me
to
him
and
kissed
me
father
and
i
were
as
a
rule
not
very
demonstrative
but
i
clung
to
him
for
a
moment
and
he
held
me
close
with
his
long
wiry
arm
i
wish
i
could
take
you
to
gresham
honey
but
old
purdy
is
very
low
and
she
expects
me
to
be
with
her
at
the
end
that
all
right
father
do
you
worry
there
are
certain
to
be
other
girls
on
the
train
who
are
going
to
gresham
and
i
butt
in
on
them
i
answered
much
more
bravely
than
i
felt
it
did
seem
terribly
lonely
and
forlorn
to
be
going
off
and
installing
myself
in
boarding
school
i
think
it
fine
that
you
can
drive
me
over
to
milton
and
put
me
on
the
train
last
night
when
i
heard
such
a
knocking
at
the
door
i
was
afraid
i
would
see
you
in
the
morning
because
you
be
off
on
some
life
or
death
mission
what
was
the
matter
oh
just
sally
winn
bread
pills
had
given
out
and
she
was
afraid
she
would
not
last
through
the
night
without
them
father
always
took
me
into
his
confidence
about
the
bread
pills
he
administered
to
the
hypochondriacs
do
you
know
father
i
believe
if
you
charged
midnight
fees
for
those
and
prescriptions
that
sally
winn
and
some
more
just
like
her
would
at
least
wait
until
morning
to
die
oh
well
little
daughter
sally
got
lots
of
good
in
her
and
trying
to
die
is
the
only
excitement
she
has
ever
had
in
her
whole
life
well
i
wo
begrudge
it
to
her
but
i
do
hate
to
have
your
rest
broken
mammy
i
said
to
mammy
susan
as
she
came
in
bearing
a
plate
of
flannel
cakes
do
you
let
father
be
too
late
getting
into
his
heavy
underwear
and
make
a
row
every
time
he
drives
the
colt
until
he
will
stop
it
from
sheer
weariness
and
father
you
make
mammy
take
her
tonic
and
do
let
her
go
out
in
the
wet
dew
waddling
around
after
her
ducks
she
will
catch
her
death
susan
you
hear
miss
page
do
dare
go
in
anything
but
dry
dew
a
few
inches
on
her
skirt
and
her
curls
tucked
up
under
her
bonnet
make
her
think
she
been
taking
care
of
us
all
these
years
instead
of
our
taking
care
of
her
law
ai
she
the
spit
of
her
ma
doc
allison
fer
yo
eyes
ai
quite
so
tall
but
she
young
yit
in
spite
er
sich
a
long
trailin
skirt
i
sorry
to
be
de
one
to
break
de
news
but
de
colt
is
out
dere
an
pawin
an
ef
you
you
better
go
i
had
often
pictured
my
going
away
and
had
always
seen
myself
with
difficulty
restraining
my
tears
but
now
the
time
had
come
and
the
colt
was
cutting
up
so
i
forgot
to
cry
even
when
i
told
the
dogs
and
just
as
i
was
giving
mammy
susan
a
last
hug
and
if
tears
were
ever
to
come
they
must
hurry
father
called
to
me
to
jump
in
for
he
hold
the
colt
another
minute
and
in
i
was
and
away
and
not
crying
at
all
but
laughing
as
we
turned
around
on
one
wheel
and
went
skimming
down
the
drive
the
sun
was
all
the
way
up
at
last
and
it
was
a
cold
damp
day
at
all
but
promised
to
be
fair
and
clear
we
had
a
drive
to
the
station
at
milton
and
the
colt
saw
to
it
that
we
got
there
in
plenty
of
time
now
page
be
certain
when
you
make
the
change
at
richmond
if
you
have
to
ask
any
questions
to
ask
them
of
a
man
in
brass
buttons
yes
father
and
i
smiled
demurely
remembering
how
i
always
acted
as
courier
when
we
went
on
our
trips
father
being
the
most
of
men
except
where
his
profession
was
concerned
was
not
to
be
trusted
with
a
railroad
ticket
moving
away
on
the
train
at
last
and
waving
to
his
long
sad
face
made
me
realize
that
the
knot
was
cut
what
a
good
father
he
was
how
had
we
ever
been
able
to
make
up
our
minds
to
this
boarding
school
scheme
nothing
but
the
certainty
that
my
education
was
a
very
affair
and
that
i
must
broaden
out
a
bit
had
determined
father
and
as
for
me
i
longed
to
know
some
girls
i
who
yearned
for
friends
was
growing
up
without
any
fifteen
years
old
and
i
had
never
had
a
real
chum
i
could
remember
my
mother
but
i
am
sure
she
would
have
been
my
chum
if
she
had
lived
mammy
susan
did
her
best
and
so
did
father
but
a
little
girl
wants
another
little
girl
we
had
neighbors
in
plenty
but
our
county
seemed
to
be
composed
of
old
maids
and
childless
widows
with
a
sparse
sprinkling
of
men
my
mother
people
were
english
and
she
had
no
relatives
on
this
side
of
the
water
father
belonged
to
a
huge
family
all
of
them
great
visitors
but
so
far
as
i
knew
no
children
among
them
all
kinds
of
old
maids
rich
and
poor
gentle
and
stern
soft
and
hard
big
and
little
they
all
managed
once
a
year
to
pay
their
dear
cousin
allison
a
visit
at
bracken
i
did
not
mind
their
coming
the
soft
ones
seemed
to
have
been
little
girls
once
which
was
something
i
used
to
think
when
i
was
quite
a
little
thing
that
the
hard
ones
must
have
been
little
boys
because
of
the
statement
in
my
mother
goose
that
little
boys
were
made
of
snaps
and
snails
and
puppy
dog
tails
not
nice
soft
collie
pups
tails
either
but
the
tight
hard
kind
that
grew
on
cousin
park
garnett
pug
cousin
park
garnett
was
the
rich
hard
one
whom
i
visited
in
richmond
the
winter
before
on
her
annual
visitation
to
us
she
had
remarked
to
my
father
cousin
james
are
page
teeth
sound
white
teeth
like
that
are
as
a
rule
not
very
strong
her
mouth
is
so
enormous
you
had
better
look
to
it
that
her
teeth
are
preserved
and
she
pursed
up
her
own
thin
lips
and
put
on
her
green
persimmon
expression
perfectly
sound
i
think
cousin
park
of
course
her
teeth
must
be
preserved
as
for
her
mouth
being
big
she
grow
up
to
it
but
the
outcome
of
the
conversation
was
that
i
had
to
visit
cousin
park
and
take
in
the
dentist
think
of
the
combination
cousin
park
took
me
to
the
woman
club
in
the
afternoon
where
we
listened
to
a
lecture
on
the
influence
of
slavic
literature
on
the
culture
of
the
day
i
was
longing
for
the
movies
but
managed
to
keep
my
big
mouth
shut
and
listen
to
the
lecture
so
i
could
tell
father
about
it
and
make
him
laugh
i
stayed
in
richmond
three
days
and
did
not
speak
to
one
single
soul
under
fifty
even
the
dentist
was
old
and
tottering
so
shaky
that
i
was
afraid
he
would
fall
into
my
mouth
i
saw
loads
of
nice
girls
my
own
age
skating
on
the
sidewalk
or
walking
chattering
away
very
happily
but
cousin
park
did
know
who
they
were
or
did
know
and
knew
nothing
to
their
credit
i
was
glad
to
get
back
to
bracken
where
there
were
no
girls
to
know
there
were
at
least
the
dogs
at
bracken
that
i
could
talk
to
and
race
over
the
hills
with
even
cousin
park
could
not
doubt
their
royal
pedigrees
it
was
dear
little
cousin
sue
lee
who
persuaded
father
and
me
both
that
i
ought
to
go
to
boarding
school
cousin
sue
was
the
best
of
all
father
female
relatives
she
was
gentle
and
poor
and
had
a
job
in
the
congressional
library
in
washington
with
all
her
gentleness
she
was
sprightly
and
had
plenty
of
what
father
called
lee
spunk
and
with
all
her
poverty
she
wore
the
sweetest
clothes
and
always
brought
me
a
lovely
present
every
year
and
a
nice
shawl
for
mammy
or
a
black
silk
waist
or
something
or
other
to
delight
the
old
woman
heart
cousin
park
never
gave
me
anything
not
that
i
wanted
her
to
she
would
visit
us
two
weeks
and
then
present
mammy
with
a
dime
using
all
the
pomp
and
ceremony
that
a
gold
piece
would
have
warranted
jimmy
cousin
sue
had
said
one
day
she
was
the
only
one
of
all
the
cousins
who
called
father
jimmy
i
know
you
and
page
will
think
i
am
an
interfering
old
cat
but
that
child
ought
to
go
to
school
i
am
not
going
to
say
a
word
about
her
education
she
has
an
excellent
education
in
some
things
i
have
never
seen
a
better
read
girl
of
her
age
but
the
time
may
come
when
she
will
regret
knowing
no
french
and
she
tells
me
she
stopped
arithmetic
last
year
and
never
started
algebra
well
what
good
did
algebra
ever
do
you
or
me
quizzed
father
now
jimmy
do
ask
such
foolish
questions
it
just
something
all
of
us
have
to
have
what
good
does
your
cravat
do
you
none
it
not
even
a
thing
of
beauty
but
you
have
to
have
one
all
the
same
oh
you
women
laughed
father
there
no
downing
you
with
argument
but
as
i
was
saying
continued
cousin
sue
it
is
not
dear
little
page
education
i
am
thinking
of
it
something
much
more
important
i
want
her
to
know
a
whole
lot
of
girls
and
make
a
million
friends
why
i
the
only
young
friend
the
child
has
and
i
am
getting
to
be
nearer
fifty
than
forty
and
so
we
wrote
for
catalogues
of
schools
and
settled
on
gresham
and
cousin
sue
sent
for
a
bolt
of
nainsook
and
yards
and
yards
of
lace
and
insertion
and
made
up
a
whole
lot
of
pretty
underclothes
for
me
girls
need
a
lot
of
things
in
this
day
and
generation
i
heard
her
say
to
father
a
great
deal
more
than
they
used
to
when
i
was
young
i
am
determined
page
shall
not
go
off
to
school
looking
like
an
annie
but
sue
your
holiday
wo
do
you
any
good
if
you
spend
it
all
sewing
on
the
machine
for
my
child
objected
father
we
get
in
miss
pinky
davis
to
help
and
in
a
week
time
page
will
have
enough
clothes
to
last
her
until
she
gets
married
that
is
if
she
does
not
follow
the
traditions
of
the
family
and
be
an
old
maid
it
was
a
pretty
well
known
fact
that
cousin
sue
had
been
a
belle
in
her
day
and
even
now
when
she
came
back
to
visit
in
the
county
several
bachelor
farmers
would
manage
to
have
business
at
bracken
i
have
always
noticed
that
an
old
maid
who
is
so
from
choice
does
not
mind
joking
about
it
but
the
others
do
a
country
doctor
is
seldom
a
bloated
so
cousin
sue
and
i
ordered
with
great
care
and
economy
the
necessary
things
from
new
york
suit
hat
gloves
shoes
shirt
waists
and
plenty
of
middies
a
raincoat
umbrella
etc
now
my
dear
said
my
sweet
cousin
you
can
be
perfectly
sure
that
your
outfit
is
appropriate
at
least
your
clothes
are
stylish
and
suitable
to
your
age
i
have
always
felt
that
young
people
clothes
should
be
so
right
that
they
do
not
have
to
think
about
them
as
i
sped
away
on
the
train
to
richmond
i
remembered
what
cousin
sue
had
said
before
she
went
back
to
the
grind
in
washington
and
had
a
feeling
of
intense
satisfaction
that
my
little
trunk
in
the
baggage
car
held
such
a
complete
wardrobe
that
i
would
not
have
to
bother
my
head
about
it
any
more
up
to
this
summer
clothes
had
been
my
abomination
but
i
had
at
last
waked
up
to
the
fact
that
it
made
some
difference
how
i
looked
and
now
i
was
going
to
look
all
right
without
any
trouble
to
myself
train
pulling
into
richmond
and
still
not
a
tear
what
is
the
matter
with
you
page
allison
when
girls
leave
their
childhood
home
in
books
they
always
weep
suds
do
you
love
your
home
as
much
as
a
stick
of
a
heroine
in
a
book
i
knew
i
loved
my
home
but
somehow
it
was
so
delightful
to
be
going
somewhere
and
maybe
getting
to
know
a
million
people
as
cousin
sue
said
i
must
an
hour
wait
in
richmond
i
rechecked
my
trunk
having
purchased
a
ticket
to
gresham
then
i
seated
myself
to
possess
my
soul
in
patience
until
the
train
should
be
called
the
station
in
richmond
was
familiar
enough
to
me
as
father
and
i
took
some
kind
of
a
trip
every
year
and
always
had
to
come
through
richmond
as
i
have
said
before
i
attended
to
tickets
and
baggage
when
i
traveled
with
father
so
i
was
not
in
the
least
nervous
over
doing
it
now
i
must
keep
my
eye
open
for
girls
who
are
likely
to
be
going
to
gresham
i
thought
they
all
have
on
dark
blue
suits
that
was
a
rule
of
the
school
the
dark
blue
suit
there
one
now
but
can
she
be
going
and
i
thought
of
what
cousin
sue
had
said
of
orphan
annie
the
girl
was
seated
opposite
me
in
the
waiting
room
she
had
just
come
up
the
steps
lugging
a
huge
telescope
stretched
to
its
greatest
capacity
and
looking
nervously
around
had
sunk
on
a
bench
she
searched
feverishly
through
a
shabby
little
she
was
carrying
and
having
satisfied
herself
that
the
ticket
she
had
just
purchased
was
safe
she
seemed
to
be
trying
to
compose
herself
but
one
could
see
with
half
an
eye
that
she
was
nervous
and
frightened
she
glanced
uneasily
at
the
clock
every
few
minutes
and
constantly
compared
with
it
an
ingersoll
watch
which
each
time
she
had
to
search
for
in
her
bag
several
trains
were
called
and
every
time
she
got
up
and
made
a
rush
for
the
gates
but
each
time
came
back
to
her
seat
opposite
me
her
blue
dress
was
evidently
homemade
the
skirt
dragged
in
the
back
and
the
jacket
was
too
short
for
the
prevailing
fashion
her
hat
had
been
worn
as
mourning
and
still
had
a
little
fold
of
crêpe
around
the
edge
making
a
suitable
setting
for
that
face
i
could
tell
whether
she
was
pretty
or
not
her
features
were
so
swollen
with
weeping
helen
of
troy
herself
looked
homely
crying
i
am
sure
i
noticed
that
her
throat
was
milk
white
and
that
the
thick
plait
of
hair
that
hung
down
her
back
mercifully
concealing
somewhat
the
crooked
seams
of
the
jacket
was
as
yellow
as
ripe
wheat
poor
thing
i
thought
i
believe
i
speak
to
her
and
see
if
i
can
cheer
her
up
some
but
my
philanthropic
resolution
was
forgotten
because
of
the
entrance
into
the
waiting
room
and
into
my
life
i
am
glad
to
add
of
the
three
most
delightful
and
original
persons
i
have
ever
seen
or
known
chapter
ii
enter
the
tuckers
two
girls
about
my
age
and
a
youngish
man
were
the
arrivals
the
girls
were
dressed
in
blue
serge
and
i
felt
in
my
bones
that
they
were
going
to
gresham
they
had
an
independent
easy
way
with
them
and
evidently
considered
the
youngish
man
a
person
whom
they
had
a
right
to
boss
let
sit
here
zebedee
and
you
go
get
the
milk
chocolate
for
me
exclaimed
one
of
the
girls
do
forget
my
salted
peanuts
and
a
copy
of
called
the
other
as
zebedee
hurried
off
to
make
the
purchases
at
the
newsstand
in
a
corner
of
the
waiting
room
elder
brother
thought
i
and
pretty
to
wait
on
those
girls
so
much
what
nice
looking
girls
they
were
though
at
the
first
glance
they
looked
singularly
alike
but
as
i
examined
them
more
closely
while
zebedee
was
gone
i
saw
points
of
dissimilarity
they
are
twins
for
sure
i
said
to
myself
but
i
believe
i
am
going
to
be
able
to
tell
them
apart
the
one
whom
her
sister
called
dum
had
red
lights
in
her
almost
black
hair
and
her
eyes
were
hazel
while
the
one
who
answered
to
the
name
of
dee
had
blue
lights
in
her
coal
black
hair
and
her
eyes
were
gray
both
of
them
had
sharply
defined
brows
straight
noses
and
broad
laughing
mouths
dum
chin
was
square
and
determined
but
in
dee
there
lurked
a
dimple
they
were
exactly
the
same
height
and
both
of
them
had
fine
athletic
figures
there
you
are
tweedles
said
the
youngish
man
addressing
them
both
as
he
pitched
his
purchases
into
their
laps
who
going
to
wait
on
you
at
boarding
school
i
like
to
know
well
if
you
will
make
us
have
a
roommate
i
reckon
she
have
to
laughed
dee
by
the
way
zebedee
that
is
something
i
want
to
discuss
with
you
and
dum
squared
her
chin
you
make
a
great
mistake
in
forcing
a
roommate
on
dee
and
me
we
are
not
used
to
it
and
we
are
not
going
to
stand
it
zebedee
squared
his
chin
too
and
his
blue
eyes
took
on
a
stern
expression
not
going
to
stand
it
eh
well
i
say
you
are
going
to
stand
it
we
have
discussed
the
matter
threadbare
already
and
you
must
trust
me
to
know
what
is
best
for
you
sometimes
the
stern
light
went
out
of
his
eyes
and
into
them
came
a
look
of
infinite
tenderness
as
he
put
an
arm
around
dum
and
held
her
close
to
him
i
certainly
liked
the
looks
of
zebedee
but
what
a
name
he
too
had
an
athletic
figure
but
not
very
tall
not
much
taller
than
the
girls
who
were
very
well
grown
for
fifteen
he
had
dum
red
black
hair
also
her
square
chin
but
dee
dimple
had
found
a
place
in
the
middle
of
that
determined
chin
the
three
mouths
were
so
alike
that
they
might
have
belonged
to
triplets
but
his
eyes
were
his
own
ice
blue
they
were
in
color
but
there
was
nothing
cold
about
them
they
were
the
kindest
merriest
eyes
they
seemed
to
see
everything
and
feel
everything
just
now
they
were
feeling
very
sorry
for
dum
and
as
he
hugged
her
big
tears
gathered
in
them
oh
dum
exclaimed
dee
now
you
have
made
him
cry
no
such
thing
i
not
crying
and
he
shamelessly
blew
his
nose
i
afterwards
learned
that
one
of
the
characteristics
of
this
delightful
trio
was
that
they
thought
there
was
no
more
shame
in
crying
than
laughing
they
laughed
in
church
if
there
was
anything
to
laugh
at
and
cried
at
a
picnic
or
if
anything
turned
up
to
move
them
to
tears
we
do
bawl
dee
said
to
me
once
we
just
leak
it
is
all
a
matter
of
tear
ducts
we
ca
help
it
any
more
than
you
could
help
sneezing
if
someone
shook
pepper
in
your
face
a
train
was
called
it
was
not
ours
but
orphan
annie
jumped
nervously
from
her
seat
she
dropped
her
shabby
little
which
she
had
just
opened
for
the
hundredth
time
to
make
sure
her
ticket
was
safe
or
to
compare
her
ingersoll
watch
with
the
clock
in
the
station
and
the
contents
of
the
bag
rolled
to
the
floor
i
dived
to
assist
her
and
the
person
called
zebedee
did
the
same
of
course
we
bumped
heads
and
while
we
were
apologizing
dum
and
dee
picked
up
the
scattered
belongings
and
returned
them
to
the
poor
abashed
girl
i
just
knew
you
were
going
to
gresham
said
dee
handing
her
the
ticket
and
wondered
how
long
it
would
take
us
to
get
to
the
point
of
speaking
to
you
you
are
for
gresham
too
said
dum
turning
to
me
i
have
been
longing
to
know
you
i
might
have
known
that
old
zebedee
would
end
by
butting
in
here
zebedee
took
off
his
hat
and
bowed
to
orphan
annie
and
me
as
though
we
were
of
the
blood
royal
and
said
with
a
most
engaging
manner
we
had
best
introduce
ourselves
and
then
all
the
conventionalities
will
be
observed
conventionality
is
a
mighty
important
thing
for
boarding
school
girls
to
observe
these
are
the
tucker
twins
called
tweedles
when
you
want
both
of
them
or
are
particular
which
one
answers
this
one
is
dum
this
one
dee
they
have
other
official
names
but
somehow
i
ca
remember
them
i
am
jeffry
tucker
at
your
service
the
father
of
the
heavenly
twins
father
you
their
father
i
gasped
certainly
whose
father
did
you
think
i
was
james
and
john
i
answered
flippantly
that
the
reason
we
called
him
zebedee
chorused
the
twins
you
know
the
old
gag
is
the
father
of
zebedee
children
no
one
ever
believes
he
is
really
a
parent
i
burst
out
laughing
and
so
did
orphan
annie
i
was
certainly
glad
to
see
that
she
could
laugh
already
the
genial
atmosphere
that
surrounded
the
tuckers
had
had
its
effect
on
her
the
drawn
expression
was
leaving
her
countenance
and
the
hearty
laugh
dispelled
the
mist
in
her
eyes
the
knowledge
that
there
were
two
other
passengers
for
gresham
set
her
mind
at
rest
and
she
evidently
felt
relieved
my
name
is
page
allison
daughter
of
james
allison
of
milton
i
bet
anything
ventured
tucker
oh
do
you
know
my
father
i
asked
joyfully
of
course
i
do
we
are
of
the
same
fraternity
your
eyes
are
so
like
his
i
came
mighty
near
slipping
you
the
grip
he
was
in
the
class
of
and
i
was
in
that
of
but
we
have
met
at
many
fraternity
conventions
i
am
certainly
glad
to
know
his
daughter
and
while
he
did
not
give
me
the
fraternity
grip
he
gave
me
some
kind
of
a
grip
that
tingled
all
the
way
up
to
my
heart
and
wo
you
tell
us
your
name
said
dee
kindly
to
the
other
stranger
annie
pore
said
the
girl
in
a
voice
singularly
full
and
rich
i
have
never
been
anywhere
alone
and
i
am
so
afraid
i
miss
my
train
that
is
the
reason
i
dropped
my
bag
i
am
so
much
obliged
to
all
of
you
for
picking
up
my
things
her
timidity
seemed
to
disappear
as
she
realized
she
was
making
friends
as
for
me
i
have
never
known
what
it
was
to
be
timid
and
i
felt
at
home
with
the
three
tuckers
from
the
moment
they
entered
the
waiting
room
and
from
the
time
that
tucker
and
i
bumped
heads
i
counted
them
as
the
first
three
on
the
list
of
the
million
friends
that
cousin
sue
said
i
must
make
well
since
we
are
all
going
to
gresham
suppose
you
young
ladies
hand
over
your
tickets
to
me
and
i
will
be
courier
for
the
crowd
said
tucker
i
gave
him
my
ticket
also
my
reservation
in
the
parlor
car
it
made
no
difference
how
poor
payments
were
father
and
i
always
traveled
in
comfort
it
saves
in
the
end
to
ride
in
a
clean
comfortable
coach
father
declared
saves
wear
and
tear
on
clothes
and
nerves
annie
pore
handed
him
her
rumpled
ticket
this
is
all
you
have
he
asked
oh
yes
is
that
all
right
she
entreated
the
man
at
the
ticket
window
assured
me
it
was
right
of
course
it
is
all
right
now
there
are
five
minutes
before
the
train
will
be
called
so
if
you
young
ladies
will
excuse
me
i
run
downstairs
to
see
that
tweedles
trunks
are
safe
by
the
way
have
you
attended
to
your
luggage
he
asked
me
and
you
turning
to
annie
pore
thank
you
yes
i
answered
but
the
other
girl
looked
piteously
at
her
bursting
telescope
i
have
a
trunk
she
said
simply
i
felt
mighty
sorry
for
annie
the
tucker
twins
did
too
i
could
tell
by
their
eyes
dee
filled
and
dum
turned
and
walked
to
the
steps
with
her
father
dee
whispered
to
me
as
she
pretended
to
show
me
a
picture
in
life
he
gone
to
get
her
a
ticket
in
the
parlor
car
just
like
him
such
a
thoughtful
zebedee
as
he
is
we
must
let
him
know
we
are
on
that
would
make
him
raging
he
will
carry
it
off
perfectly
naturally
and
he
is
fully
capable
of
any
deceit
to
keep
annie
pore
from
finding
it
out
he
had
done
exactly
as
dee
said
he
would
do
got
a
chair
in
the
parlor
car
for
orphan
annie
right
there
i
took
myself
to
task
for
thinking
of
the
poor
girl
as
orphan
annie
and
i
determined
to
control
my
thoughts
if
possible
and
give
her
her
proper
name
in
my
mind
not
that
annie
pore
sounded
much
more
cheerful
than
the
name
i
had
given
her
our
train
was
called
and
our
kind
courier
bundled
up
bag
and
baggage
and
hustled
us
through
the
gates
and
into
the
chair
car
before
annie
pore
had
time
to
ask
about
it
and
then
he
gave
the
pullman
conductor
our
tickets
and
settled
us
and
the
train
started
and
the
girl
never
did
know
she
was
being
treated
to
a
privilege
her
ticket
did
not
give
her
we
had
a
jolly
trip
and
before
it
was
over
i
knew
a
great
deal
about
the
tuckers
and
they
in
turn
a
great
deal
about
me
in
fact
about
all
there
was
to
know
it
was
many
a
day
however
before
we
broke
through
annie
pore
reserve
and
learned
that
she
was
of
english
parentage
that
her
mother
had
recently
died
and
her
father
had
a
country
store
in
a
lonesome
little
settlement
on
the
river
no
wonder
the
girl
was
so
scary
this
was
actually
her
first
railroad
journey
what
traveling
she
had
done
had
been
by
boat
an
occasional
trip
to
norfolk
or
richmond
when
her
father
went
to
town
to
buy
his
stock
there
was
an
unmistakable
air
of
breeding
about
her
her
accent
was
pure
and
her
english
without
flaw
in
spite
of
her
timidity
she
had
a
certain
for
instance
when
tucker
announced
that
we
were
to
have
lunch
with
him
and
ordered
the
porter
to
bring
two
tables
and
put
them
up
annie
accepted
the
invitation
with
a
quiet
grace
that
many
a
society
woman
could
not
have
equaled
when
she
took
off
her
ugly
hat
disclosing
to
view
a
calm
white
forehead
with
heavy
hair
rippling
from
a
part
i
had
no
doubt
of
the
fact
that
annie
pore
if
not
already
a
beauty
was
going
to
be
one
when
she
grew
up
it
was
only
a
buffet
luncheon
and
there
was
not
much
on
the
menu
to
choose
from
baked
beans
canned
soup
potted
meats
etc
not
much
to
eat
here
grumbled
tucker
eat
what
put
before
you
zebedee
and
stop
grouching
admonished
dum
well
it
a
pretty
hard
state
of
affairs
when
a
fellow
wants
to
give
a
party
and
there
is
nothing
to
eat
but
these
canned
abominations
i
have
a
lunch
box
in
my
grip
i
ventured
maybe
that
would
help
out
some
trot
it
out
do
cried
dee
and
then
annie
had
the
hardihood
to
untie
the
rope
around
her
telescope
and
bring
out
a
bag
of
the
very
best
and
rosiest
apples
i
ever
tasted
she
also
produced
a
box
of
doughnuts
she
had
made
herself
which
were
greeted
with
enthusiasm
my
lunch
had
been
put
up
by
kind
old
mammy
susan
and
in
her
tenderness
she
had
packed
in
enough
to
feed
a
regiment
fried
chicken
exclaimed
dee
clapping
her
hands
columbus
eggs
shouted
dum
not
really
country
ham
questioned
tucker
that
is
too
good
to
be
true
you
must
excuse
tweedles
and
me
but
we
have
been
living
in
an
apartment
and
eating
in
the
café
and
some
real
home
food
has
just
about
got
us
going
when
i
asked
you
young
ladies
to
lunch
i
did
not
dream
that
i
would
be
able
to
treat
you
so
royally
look
zebedee
look
rolls
chorused
the
twins
stop
tweedling
and
look
over
the
menu
and
see
what
we
shall
order
to
supplement
with
tucker
called
it
tweedling
when
the
girls
spoke
in
chorus
as
was
their
habit
we
decided
on
cream
of
tomato
soup
iced
tea
and
butter
with
neopolitan
ice
cream
to
top
off
with
i
was
certainly
glad
that
as
usual
mammy
susan
had
paid
no
attention
to
my
commands
and
had
done
her
own
sweet
will
in
giving
me
enough
lunch
for
half
a
dozen
girls
it
bes
to
err
on
de
side

the
old
woman

size
of
the
lunch
boxes

chapter
iii
gresham
gresham
at
last
after
a
very
pleasant
trip
we
had
picked
up
girls
all
along
the
road
and
by
the
time
we
reached
the
little
town
on
the
outskirts
of
which
our
school
was
situated
the
train
seemed
to
be
running
over
with
girls
there
must
be
a
million
of
them
i
thought
but
as
gresham
could
only
accommodate
one
hundred
and
i
was
wrong
some
of
them
had
mothers
or
fathers
with
them
and
some
of
them
big
brothers
or
sisters
most
of
them
had
some
one
at
least
most
of
the
new
girls
the
old
pupils
hugged
and
kissed
one
another
and
all
seemed
to
be
glad
to
get
back
to
school
the
new
girls
looked
sad
and
miserable
even
the
ones
who
had
their
mothers
with
them
and
a
few
lonesome
ones
who
had
brought
themselves
like
orphan
annie
there
i
slipped
again
and
called
annie
pore
by
that
obnoxious
name
or
me
looked
like
scared
rabbits
i
was
scared
a
bit
and
when
i
saw
the
old
girls
hugging
and
loving
one
another
flaunting
their
intimacies
as
it
were
i
said
do
you
mind
page
allison
you
are
going
to
know
all
of
those
girls
and
like
a
lot
of
them
and
a
lot
of
them
are
going
to
like
you
and
they
are
just
a
few
of
the
million
friends
you
are
going
to
make
in
the
crowded
confusion
at
the
little
station
i
was
separated
from
the
tuckers
and
noticed
that
poor
annie
was
put
in
a
bus
filled
with
seniors
who
looked
at
her
rather
askance
her
ungainly
telescope
was
piled
up
with
the
natty
suitcases
by
the
driver
seat
and
i
saw
him
point
at
it
and
wink
at
the
driver
of
the
bus
where
i
had
found
a
seat
the
girls
in
the
bus
with
me
were
very
kind
and
friendly
there
were
several
mothers
along
and
they
looked
at
me
cordially
and
in
a
few
minutes
i
knew
the
names
of
all
the
passengers
and
they
knew
mine
by
the
time
the
straining
horses
had
pulled
the
heavy
bus
through
the
crooked
streets
of
the
quaint
little
town
up
and
down
the
many
hills
and
finally
up
the
last
long
hill
to
gresham
school
the
whole
load
of
girls
and
mothers
had
been
jolted
into
an
enforced
intimacy
bracken
my
home
was
situated
in
what
persons
from
the
mountains
call
a
flat
country
but
which
we
call
rolling
as
it
is
when
compared
to
the
tidewater
counties
so
the
hills
of
gresham
seemed
wonderfully
steep
to
me
and
as
we
pulled
to
the
top
and
stopped
in
front
of
the
school
and
i
realized
we
could
actually
see
the
mountains
i
gave
voice
to
a
o
h
of
delight
we
piled
out
of
the
bus
and
for
a
moment
i
stood
looking
at
the
wonderful
view
before
i
even
noticed
the
school
building
i
am
so
glad
you
like
it
said
a
soft
voice
at
my
side
it
belonged
to
a
girl
who
had
come
up
with
us
she
looked
a
little
older
than
the
rest
of
the
girls
and
certainly
was
much
more
dignified
i
find
if
a
new
pupil
notices
the
mountains
first
she
is
pretty
apt
not
to
kick
because
they
have
dessert
only
twice
a
week
one
ca
have
everything
in
this
world
and
a
mountain
view
is
more
filling
in
the
big
end
than
dessert
it
is
splendid
you
have
been
here
a
long
time
i
asked
yes
many
years
and
now
i
am
a
pupil
teacher
this
place
seems
more
like
home
than
any
other
in
the
world
to
me
and
she
took
me
by
the
arm
come
on
with
me
page
i
am
going
to
call
you
page
and
i
do
wish
you
could
call
me
margaret
but
now
that
i
am
a
near
teacher
i
have
to
be
called
miss
sayre
i
am
going
to
introduce
you
to
miss
peyton
the
principal
oh
you
are
kind
to
me
and
i
am
so
much
obliged
give
the
bus
driver
your
trunk
check
and
in
his
good
time
he
will
deliver
your
trunk
come
on
so
you
can
get
into
the
office
before
the
rush
of
seniors
just
then
the
vehicle
with
annie
pore
in
it
looking
too
forlorn
for
words
came
rattling
up
her
hat
was
knocked
over
one
eye
and
she
had
lost
all
of
the
cheerfulness
that
she
had
gained
on
the
train
with
the
delightful
tuckers
no
one
had
paid
any
attention
to
her
on
the
ride
except
to
look
her
up
and
down
and
make
whispered
jokes
at
her
expense
i
have
found
out
that
girls
can
be
the
most
cruel
creatures
in
the
world
just
from
pure
thoughtlessness
and
lack
of
imagination
they
do
know
how
to
put
yourself
in
his
place
they
do
mean
to
hurt
but
they
do
hurt
all
the
same
i
found
during
the
ensuing
year
that
that
same
busload
of
seniors
included
many
a
fine
character
but
not
one
of
them
seemed
to
have
imagination
enough
to
know
what
annie
pore
was
suffering
miss
sayre
i
said
impulsively
please
take
this
girl
with
you
i
met
her
on
the
train
and
she
seems
so
forlorn
we
miss
our
chance
to
reach
miss
peyton
ahead
of
the
others
unless
we
hurry
she
said
looking
a
little
impatient
at
my
request
i
sorry
i
think
i
ought
to
wait
for
her
but
do
let
me
detain
you
and
i
went
forward
to
meet
poor
annie
of
course
miss
sayre
came
too
i
might
have
known
that
a
girl
who
noticed
the
mountains
first
thing
would
have
character
enough
to
do
what
she
thought
was
right
she
whispered
as
she
followed
me
this
is
annie
pore
miss
sayre
i
said
as
i
helped
the
cramped
girl
out
of
her
uncomfortably
small
quarters
miss
sayre
shook
her
hand
cordially
and
i
hoped
annie
did
not
hear
the
titter
as
one
of
the
seniors
nudged
another
and
said
in
an
audible
whisper
annie
pore
poor
orphan
annie
i
hated
myself
for
having
had
the
same
thought
where
is
your
trunk
check
annie
give
it
to
the
bus
driver
said
miss
sayre
kindly
i
have
a
trunk
said
annie
faintly
just
a
telescope
by
their
luggage
ye
shall
know
them
said
a
stylish
girl
who
was
clambering
out
of
the
vehicle
she
spoke
in
a
rasping
tone
with
a
nasal
touch
annie
pore
made
a
ten
strike
right
then
and
there
with
me
and
with
all
of
the
girls
who
heard
what
she
said
and
those
girls
who
did
not
hear
it
soon
heard
about
it
she
drew
herself
up
no
longer
timid
but
with
what
dum
tucker
afterwards
called
annie
stage
presence
and
in
her
singularly
clear
full
voice
that
voice
that
we
were
all
to
be
so
proud
of
said
not
by
their
luggage
ye
shall
know
them
but
by
their
voices
and
with
a
dignity
that
a
sagging
skirt
and
jacket
could
not
lessen
annie
pore
walked
to
the
front
of
the
and
demanded
from
the
grinning
driver
her
bursting
telescope
a
shout
went
up
from
the
seniors
annie
annie
so
mabel
binks
she
got
your
goat
that
time
laughed
a
senior
i
do
know
what
you
mean
sally
coles
orphan
annie
remark
seemed
to
me
to
be
without
point
and
mabel
binks
haughtily
demanded
a
very
swell
new
alligator
bag
from
the
front
seat
well
if
you
do
know
that
your
voice
needs
greasing
it
is
not
for
me
to
break
it
to
you
mabel
mabel
flounced
off
and
all
her
stylish
clothes
skirt
jacket
and
jaunty
velvet
sailor
hat
did
not
give
dignity
to
her
pandemonium
reigned
as
we
entered
the
spacious
hall
of
the
main
building
girls
girls
girls
little
and
big
fat
and
thin
pretty
and
plain
laughing
and
crying
alone
and
attended
they
swarmed
over
everything
we
have
lost
our
chance
to
get
first
at
the
principal
but
i
have
missed
seeing
annie
pore
take
down
that
common
mabel
binks
for
a
million
as
poor
as
i
am
whispered
miss
sayre
you
girls
sit
here
and
wait
for
me
and
as
soon
as
there
is
an
opening
we
slip
in
oh
how
could
i
ever
have
made
up
my
mind
to
leave
my
father
and
come
here
wailed
annie
crumpling
up
into
an
ignominious
heap
all
her
dignity
gone
now
look
here
annie
pore
i
scolded
anyone
who
could
jaw
back
at
a
senior
as
you
did
just
a
moment
ago
has
got
backbone
and
you
have
just
got
to
get
a
brace
on
you
and
cheer
up
oh
but
you
are
different
you
make
friends
so
readily
i
am
so
easily
embarrassed
and
the
poor
thing
wept
anew
i
do
make
friends
a
bit
more
easily
than
you
do
i
just
want
to
make
them
that
the
difference
have
you
made
friends
with
me
oh
have
i
really
of
course
you
have
would
i
be
ragging
you
this
way
if
i
consider
myself
your
friend
have
you
made
friends
with
all
three
of
the
tuckers
and
now
with
miss
sayre
annie
was
somewhat
consoled
and
tried
to
take
a
more
cheerful
view
of
life
we
had
completely
lost
sight
of
our
traveling
companions
they
had
evidently
been
admitted
among
the
first
to
the
principal
office
all
of
the
girls
who
were
accompanied
by
their
parents
or
guardians
were
given
preference
in
having
their
rooms
assigned
them
so
that
their
loved
ones
could
see
where
the
daughters
were
to
be
placed
and
then
take
their
departure
on
the
outgoing
trains
we
were
so
hidden
by
the
swarming
girls
we
despaired
of
ever
being
found
again
by
miss
sayre
but
i
persuaded
annie
that
we
would
certainly
be
placed
by
bedtime
as
both
of
us
had
been
registered
during
the
summer
and
in
the
meantime
it
was
rather
fun
to
watch
the
girls
and
try
to
guess
where
they
came
from
and
if
any
of
them
were
to
be
in
our
classes
mabel
binks
backed
up
against
us
talking
to
an
overdressed
girl
of
about
nineteen
both
were
dressed
in
the
latest
style
i
knew
what
those
styles
were
from
the
fashion
books
that
cousin
sue
lee
had
bought
when
we
were
planning
my
modest
wardrobe
i
am
thankful
to
say
this
is
my
last
year
at
gresham
said
mabel
the
place
has
lost
tone
so
we
came
up
in
the
bus
with
a
most
person
i
am
sure
mamma
would
not
permit
me
to
remain
if
she
knew
miss
peyton
was
allowing
such
ordinary
girls
to
come
here
annie
pore
face
was
crimson
and
she
looked
ready
to
burst
into
tears
but
the
overdressed
girl
whose
name
i
afterwards
learned
was
josephine
barr
and
who
was
a
thoroughly
kindly
person
remarked
oh
yes
i
heard
about
that
girl
sally
coles
tells
me
she
is
wonderfully
pretty
and
quite
a
lady
also
that
she
got
a
yell
from
the
seniors
for
her
quickness
in
responding
to
a
sally
from
you
i
pinched
annie
arm
and
whispered
what
did
i
tell
you
two
more
new
friends
sally
coles
and
this
big
girl
who
has
just
punctured
mabel
binks
conceit
come
along
girls
and
miss
sayre
pushed
her
way
to
our
retreat
i
think
we
can
get
into
the
office
now
how
do
you
do
josephine
i
am
glad
to
see
you
back
and
she
shook
the
big
girl
hand
cordially
i
want
to
introduce
you
to
two
new
girls
and
ask
you
to
see
that
they
meet
the
crowd
all
right
margaret
what
you
say
goes
i
was
a
freshy
myself
once
and
know
how
it
feels
she
gave
us
a
cordial
grip
and
assured
us
we
must
call
on
her
if
we
needed
anything
friendly
counsel
or
protection
or
even
soothing
syrup
jo
is
a
fine
old
girl
said
miss
sayre
as
she
hooked
one
arm
in
mine
and
the
other
in
annie
pore
and
drew
us
into
the
office
i
noticed
that
she
had
completely
ignored
mabel
binks
she
would
fight
to
the
finish
for
her
friends
her
clothes
are
impossible
but
we
must
judge
the
poor
thing
by
her
clothes
they
got
so
much
money
they
know
what
to
do
with
it
i
real
sorry
for
her
it
seemed
a
queer
cause
for
pity
to
annie
and
me
but
miss
sayre
was
introducing
us
to
miss
peyton
and
we
could
not
ask
her
why
riches
were
to
be
pitied
i
liked
miss
peyton
from
the
minute
i
saw
her
and
i
believe
she
liked
me
her
countenance
was
a
noble
one
her
manner
frank
and
her
voice
sounded
like
music
i
am
going
to
put
you
into
the
room
with
some
sisters
page
i
hope
you
will
get
along
well
together
if
everything
is
not
pleasant
come
directly
to
me
you
are
no
in
carter
hall
i
will
see
all
the
girls
and
classify
them
miss
sayre
will
you
please
get
someone
to
show
page
her
room
now
i
will
talk
to
annie
pore
and
assign
her
her
roommate
and
miss
peyton
went
on
quietly
with
what
might
have
been
a
confusing
task
but
which
she
managed
as
calmly
as
a
napoleon
marshaling
his
troops
i
found
my
way
to
carter
hall
with
the
help
of
an
old
girl
i
was
naturally
quite
interested
to
know
what
the
sisters
were
to
be
like
who
were
to
be
my
roommates
for
the
year
the
door
to
was
open
and
i
heard
sobbing
chapter
iv
my
roommates
illustration
they
made
such
a
racket
that
a
sad
crooked
face
was
poked
into
the
heavens
i
tired
of
tears
i
thought
as
my
conductor
left
me
with
a
significant
smile
i
actually
damp
from
all
of
the
weeping
going
on
around
me
a
stormy
voice
was
raised
in
the
room
that
i
was
about
to
enter
and
i
stopped
in
the
hall
not
knowing
just
what
to
do
now
what
did
i
tell
you
said
the
stormy
sobbing
voice
did
i
tell
you
all
along
i
was
going
to
make
myself
just
as
disagreeable
as
i
could
if
you
would
put
someone
in
with
us
are
we
going
to
be
miserable
enough
without
you
without
having
some
old
hoisted
on
us
from
the
country
to
sleep
in
the
room
with
us
and
just
as
like
as
not
want
the
window
shut
at
night
and
rub
her
chapped
face
all
over
with
paugh
i
can
smell
it
now
the
horrid
stuff
now
dum
cut
it
out
you
do
even
know
that
your
roommate
gets
chapped
said
a
whimsical
voice
the
tuckers
i
exclaimed
but
naturally
had
a
delicacy
in
entering
after
what
i
had
heard
dum
say
about
a
roommate
from
the
country
could
she
know
that
i
am
the
one
i
asked
myself
well
how
are
dee
and
i
to
fight
it
out
the
way
you
have
brought
us
up
to
do
if
we
have
got
some
old
mutt
in
here
with
us
we
might
just
as
well
have
left
our
boxing
gloves
at
home
oh
dum
you
are
making
it
hard
for
me
said
poor
tucker
that
good
i
want
to
make
it
hard
sobbed
the
wretched
dum
i
have
told
you
over
and
over
that
i
think
it
best
for
you
and
dee
to
have
to
control
yourselves
more
and
the
only
way
to
do
it
is
to
realize
how
your
tantrums
affect
other
people
you
are
the
best
old
tweedles
in
the
world
but
you
have
no
i
am
surely
sorry
for
your
roommate
whoever
she
may
be
well
broke
in
dee
i
think
it
all
depends
on
who
she
is
i
must
say
it
is
some
lottery
roommates
ought
to
be
carefully
chosen
one
should
not
just
trust
to
this
method
well
how
do
you
know
miss
peyton
has
not
chosen
someone
she
feels
will
be
suitable
i
wish
it
would
turn
out
to
be
somebody
like
the
little
girl
on
the
train
do
you
tweedles
yes
yes
tweedled
tweedles
but
no
such
luck
this
reassured
me
and
i
knocked
on
the
open
door
there
was
perfect
silence
broken
only
by
the
sound
of
dum
blowing
her
nose
and
tucker
clearing
his
throat
and
then
a
faint
little
come
in
from
both
girls
oh
it
you
how
good
of
you
to
come
look
us
up
exclaimed
tucker
we
were
afraid
it
was
the
hated
roommate
tweedles
are
treating
me
so
terribly
because
i
insist
on
their
having
a
roommate
so
they
can
broaden
out
a
bit
and
learn
to
control
themselves
some
which
they
will
never
do
so
long
as
they
stay
together
all
the
time
i
leave
it
to
you
miss
page
do
you
think
it
will
be
best
well
i
have
a
delicacy
in
saying
laughed
i
you
see
i
am
that
poor
unfortunate
despised
roommate
this
is
carter
hall
is
it
then
all
the
weeping
was
turned
to
laughter
and
the
irrepressible
tuckers
father
and
all
grabbed
hands
and
danced
around
me
singing
gayly
cheer
the
bride
they
made
such
a
racket
that
a
sad
crooked
face
was
poked
into
the
door
evidently
feeling
a
duty
to
admonish
but
zebedee
in
his
most
zebedeeish
humor
sang
out
in
a
friendly
voice
will
you
wo
you
will
you
wo
you
will
you
join
the
dance
will
you
wo
you
will
you
wo
you
wo
you
join
the
dance
then
the
strangest
thing
happened
to
that
long
sad
crooked
face
the
plain
features
were
illuminated
by
a
smile
the
person
who
owned
the
face
came
impulsively
into
the
room
and
after
she
had
carefully
shut
the
door
she
caught
hold
of
hands
with
the
crazy
trio
and
the
dance
went
on
and
all
of
us
sang
you
walk
a
little
faster
said
a
whiting
to
a
snail
a
porpoise
close
behind
us
and
he
treading
on
my
tail
see
how
eagerly
the
lobsters
and
the
turtles
all
advance
they
are
waiting
on
the
shingle
will
you
come
and
join
the
dance
then
the
chorus
will
you
wo
you
will
you
wo
you
will
you
join
the
dance
i
refused
to
play
frog
in
the
middle
any
longer
and
broke
into
the
dance
soon
dropping
into
the
unfamiliar
tune
but
very
familiar
words
of
the
lobster
quadrille
we
sang
all
four
of
the
verses
from
that
immortal
nonsense
matters
it
how
far
we
go
his
scaly
friend
replied
is
another
shore
you
know
upon
the
other
side
the
farther
off
from
england
the
nearer
is
to
france
then
turn
not
pale
beloved
snail
but
come
and
join
the
dance
the
owner
of
the
long
sad
crooked
face
was
also
owner
of
a
singularly
clear
true
voice
and
tucker
fresh
baritone
fitted
in
finely
while
dum
and
dee
and
i
did
the
best
we
could
with
what
nature
had
seen
fit
to
endow
us
in
the
way
of
voices
finally
we
girls
sank
exhausted
on
the
bare
uncovered
beds
but
tucker
and
the
mysterious
visitor
stood
clasping
hands
jeff
tucker
what
in
heaven
name
are
you
doing
at
a
young
boarding
school
entering
my
girls
tweedles
and
you
jinny
cox
what
are
you
doing
here
and
tucker
kept
on
shaking
her
hand
i
teach
singing
here
have
been
here
for
years
and
to
think
of
your
girls
being
old
enough
to
go
to
boarding
school
it
seems
only
yesterday
that
you
and
dear
little
virginia
were
leading
the
germans
at
the
university
i
have
seen
you
since
you
married
i
meant
to
write
you
when
virginia
died
but
somehow
i
just
could
that
was
all
right
jinny
i
knew
how
you
felt
without
hearing
from
you
she
only
lived
a
year
you
know
tweedles
were
just
a
few
weeks
old
when
she
died
and
the
dear
man
who
a
moment
before
had
been
so
cheerily
singing
the
lobster
quadrille
now
wiped
his
eyes
and
seemed
given
over
to
melancholy
i
want
you
to
know
our
girls
this
is
virginia
indicating
dum
and
this
caroline
meaning
dee
i
was
rather
amused
at
the
fact
that
earlier
in
the
day
he
could
not
remember
their
official
names
as
he
called
them
i
named
this
one
virginia
thinking
she
was
going
to
have
her
mother
eyes
but
the
little
monkey
changed
them
on
me
and
in
a
twinkling
turned
herself
into
a
monster
and
poor
zebedee
forgot
to
cry
any
more
and
began
to
laugh
this
is
the
much
dreaded
roommate
miss
page
allison
of
milton
virginia
the
wild
orgy
which
you
so
tactfully
joined
was
in
honor
of
the
discovery
that
this
young
lady
was
the
roommate
well
girls
i
am
glad
to
see
all
of
you
and
hope
we
can
be
great
friends
my
name
is
jane
cox
i
ca
remember
any
one
having
the
hardihood
to
call
me
jinny
for
some
sixteen
or
seventeen
years
i
have
danced
for
at
least
ten
years
i
do
know
what
the
management
or
the
girls
would
think
or
say
if
they
knew
i
had
cut
up
this
way
i
do
know
what
made
me
do
it
i
came
to
the
door
to
stop
the
racket
and
when
i
saw
jeff
tucker
whirling
around
with
three
girls
singing
you
wo
you
wo
you
will
you
will
you
join
the
dance
my
discretion
flew
to
the
four
winds
i
just
did
have
sense
enough
left
to
shut
the
door
i
forgot
i
was
an
old
maid
teaching
singing
in
a
boarding
school
it
was
simply
splendid
of
you
to
come
in
and
help
us
out
exclaimed
dee
dee
was
usually
the
one
who
knew
what
to
say
and
when
to
say
it
some
persons
call
it
tact
but
i
have
always
thought
it
was
just
a
kind
heart
that
made
her
know
what
people
wanted
her
to
say
cousin
sue
lee
was
the
same
kind
of
social
wonder
i
think
your
voice
is
beautiful
and
how
on
earth
did
you
happen
to
know
our
tune
why
child
your
father
and
i
made
up
that
tune
on
a
picnic
once
years
before
you
were
born
do
you
remember
jeff
when
we
went
to
monticello
and
how
it
rained
we
composed
the
tune
and
improvised
a
lobster
quadrille
to
cheer
up
the
bedraggled
crowd
how
virginia
did
laugh
i
have
thought
of
that
tune
for
ages
perhaps
it
is
because
i
have
not
been
with
the
kind
of
people
who
would
enjoy
in
wonderland
zebedee
has
put
us
to
sleep
with
it
ever
since
we
were
born
said
dum
i
mean
the
tune
and
i
have
been
reading
alice
in
wonderland
ever
since
i
was
born
i
ventured
well
i
certainly
glad
to
meet
some
kindred
spirits
at
gresham
said
miss
cox
and
now
girls
i
going
to
ask
a
great
favor
of
the
three
of
you
i
want
you
to
keep
to
yourselves
that
i
broke
loose
as
i
did
i
have
hard
enough
work
as
it
is
keeping
order
during
study
hour
when
that
task
falls
to
me
and
if
the
girls
ever
found
out
that
i
was
capable
of
such
i
lose
all
control
of
them
we
promised
but
i
for
one
thought
that
the
more
human
you
find
your
pastors
and
masters
to
be
the
more
apt
you
are
to
want
to
make
things
easy
for
them
miss
jane
cox
was
much
older
than
i
but
she
had
yet
to
learn
that
wisdom
we
all
promise
we
declared
in
unison
but
please
break
loose
again
sometimes
jinny
begged
tucker
the
idea
of
your
calling
yourself
an
old
maid
i
bet
you
are
not
yet
i
only
myself
and
goodness
knows
i
am
nothing
but
a
kid
teaching
is
a
very
aging
occupation
sighed
miss
cox
i
do
mind
the
singing
but
it
teaching
mathematics
to
the
backward
pupils
that
adds
ten
years
a
season
to
my
already
full
years
do
your
girls
sing
jeffry
not
so
you
can
notice
it
dum
here
is
going
to
be
a
great
sculptor
and
dee
is
uncertain
whether
she
wants
to
be
a
trained
nurse
or
a
veterinary
surgeon
surgeon
surely
you
would
let
her
go
into
such
a
profession
exclaimed
miss
cox
with
her
twisted
smile
why
not
i
let
my
girls
go
into
any
profession
that
appeals
to
them
dum
loves
to
make
mud
pies
and
dee
loves
to
nurse
sick
puppies
both
of
them
rather
dirty
arts
but
man
to
his
taste
miss
cox
had
to
leave
us
and
go
to
attend
to
various
duties
but
before
going
she
assured
tucker
that
she
would
take
especial
care
of
all
three
of
his
girls
you
can
fancy
what
it
meant
to
me
to
be
included
i
almost
called
him
zebedee
but
i
was
afraid
it
might
make
him
feel
like
the
father
of
triplets
so
i
refrained
it
was
almost
time
for
the
train
which
tucker
was
to
catch
as
he
intended
to
take
a
sleeper
back
to
richmond
that
night
i
felt
the
tactful
thing
for
me
to
do
would
be
to
leave
the
girls
alone
with
their
father
so
i
told
him
and
went
off
to
see
how
annie
pore
was
faring
i
found
her
sitting
in
a
forlorn
heap
in
one
of
the
neighboring
rooms
her
hat
and
jacket
still
on
her
disreputable
telescope
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
the
expression
on
her
face
suited
to
the
tragic
muse
who
your
cellmate
annie
said
i
bursting
in
on
her
i
do
know
but
i
know
she
will
hate
me
hate
you
indeed
no
one
could
hate
you
why
do
you
unpack
and
get
your
things
in
order
i
am
going
to
stay
with
you
until
tucker
leaves
so
tweedles
can
get
a
chance
to
be
alone
with
him
for
a
while
i
am
rooming
with
them
you
know
our
room
is
quite
near
you
and
we
can
all
be
real
chummy
the
rooms
were
all
perfectly
bare
and
white
walls
white
iron
beds
curtainless
windows
and
carpetless
floors
the
pupils
were
supposed
to
decorate
their
own
rooms
if
they
wanted
them
decorated
annie
pore
had
been
put
into
a
room
a
bit
smaller
than
the
one
assigned
to
the
tuckers
and
me
but
otherwise
exactly
like
it
i
am
dreading
a
roommate
sighed
the
girl
i
have
never
slept
in
the
room
with
any
one
in
my
life
neither
have
i
but
i
am
crazy
about
it
just
think
what
fun
it
will
be
to
have
some
one
to
talk
to
and
giggle
with
i
could
not
fancy
giggling
with
annie
pore
in
her
present
melancholy
frame
of
mind
but
i
was
sure
that
was
a
phase
that
would
pass
and
she
would
end
by
being
as
girlish
as
the
next
she
had
too
keen
a
sense
of
humor
to
be
lost
in
gloom
forever
chapter
letters
from
caroline
tucker
to
her
father
jeffry
tucker
gresham
dearest
zebedee
you
would
have
to
be
your
own
daughter
to
know
how
much
you
can
be
missed
after
you
left
the
other
day
dum
and
i
cried
so
much
we
came
mighty
near
getting
sick
but
page
allison
came
back
and
was
so
ridiculous
in
her
description
of
annie
pore
sitting
up
in
the
bus
full
of
seniors
with
her
crêpe
hat
cocked
on
one
side
that
we
got
to
laughing
and
you
know
how
easy
it
is
to
be
cheerful
if
someone
only
starts
the
ball
page
is
splendid
and
takes
the
most
interest
in
life
of
anybody
i
ever
saw
she
makes
a
lot
of
fun
but
somehow
it
is
never
at
anyone
but
always
with
them
she
loves
dogs
too
so
i
am
sure
to
get
on
with
her
i
do
think
it
was
wise
in
you
dearest
zebedee
to
make
us
have
a
roommate
since
that
roommate
happens
to
be
page
because
she
certainly
does
do
us
good
and
already
i
find
i
am
trying
to
exert
more
as
you
say
when
you
are
trying
to
be
tuckerish
she
hates
blubbering
and
never
cries
except
when
the
dogs
die
or
her
father
reads
poetry
to
her
i
tell
her
that
we
usually
cry
either
that
is
we
do
bawl
but
just
leak
a
bit
she
says
just
leaking
is
rather
fascinating
and
shows
temperament
and
she
wishes
she
was
so
and
could
express
her
emotions
in
such
a
graceful
way
page
has
read
a
whole
lot
and
knows
reams
and
quires
of
history
but
never
has
studied
any
french
at
all
and
has
to
go
with
the
kids
in
mathematics
she
is
real
spunky
about
it
though
and
does
say
a
word
about
how
humiliating
it
must
be
to
have
to
sit
in
a
class
with
children
of
twelve
and
even
younger
she
can
write
latin
like
a
house
afire
but
when
she
translates
we
can
hardly
keep
from
giggling
outright
as
she
uses
the
funny
old
pronunciation
that
grandpa
tucker
does
it
seems
she
has
learned
latin
entirely
from
her
father
miss
sears
the
latin
teacher
is
trying
to
get
her
out
of
this
pronunciation
but
she
compliments
her
very
much
on
her
knowledge
of
english
derivatives
page
says
that
is
the
side
of
latin
that
interested
her
father
and
he
consequently
taught
it
to
her
dum
and
i
have
had
only
one
serious
since
you
left
us
i
licked
her
i
wish
you
would
send
dum
a
dollar
box
of
plasticine
she
is
restless
sometimes
and
i
know
she
is
itching
to
create
and
if
she
had
the
mud
she
could
do
it
dum
is
being
awfully
good
about
holding
on
to
herself
and
is
just
as
nice
and
polite
to
page
as
can
be
although
she
did
vow
and
declare
that
she
was
going
to
make
it
so
hot
for
any
roommate
we
got
that
the
poor
thing
would
have
to
leave
of
course
that
was
before
we
knew
it
was
going
to
be
our
luck
to
draw
such
a
prize
there
the
bell
so
dear
old
zebedeedlums
your
own
tweedledeelums
virginia
tucker
to
her
father
jeffry
tucker
gresham
my
darling
zebedee
dee
wrote
yesterday
so
i
waited
until
although
she
declared
she
was
not
writing
the
kind
of
thing
to
you
that
i
was
going
to
i
do
see
how
she
knew
what
i
was
going
to
write
when
i
do
know
myself
there
is
one
thing
i
want
to
say
and
that
is
the
old
man
always
knows
best
a
roommate
is
a
great
institution
when
she
is
as
bully
as
page
allison
i
was
awfully
afraid
dee
was
going
to
be
rude
but
she
has
been
a
bit
as
for
me
i
have
been
a
little
tin
angel
you
can
ask
dee
if
i
have
i
am
mighty
sorry
for
dee
she
not
only
misses
you
just
as
much
as
i
do
but
she
misses
old
brindle
almost
as
much
as
she
does
you
i
do
see
why
they
wo
let
a
bulldog
go
to
boarding
school
i
asked
dee
if
she
gave
you
any
more
directions
about
how
to
take
care
of
brindle
and
she
said
she
had
even
mentioned
him
she
was
so
afraid
of
splashing
on
her
letter
your
friend
miss
cox
has
been
in
to
see
us
and
was
just
as
jolly
as
could
be
but
when
the
other
girls
are
around
she
treats
us
like
perfect
strangers
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
she
is
afraid
of
girls
and
does
not
understand
them
nor
do
they
understand
her
i
got
that
from
page
who
is
very
analytical
page
says
if
she
would
let
herself
go
she
would
be
the
most
popular
teacher
in
school
but
as
it
is
while
she
is
not
unpopular
she
is
not
regarded
at
all
she
is
awfully
interesting
but
the
girls
do
know
it
they
know
she
has
a
good
voice
and
teaches
with
good
method
but
she
might
as
well
be
a
phonograph
for
all
the
human
interest
they
have
in
her
she
is
coach
for
the
backward
and
wayward
in
math
i
believe
page
allison
will
have
to
have
her
and
i
bet
on
page
for
drawing
her
out
i
tell
you
that
girl
has
done
wonders
with
annie
pore
every
time
she
finds
her
crying
she
makes
her
laugh
and
you
know
no
one
but
old
zebedee
can
laugh
and
cry
at
the
same
time
without
going
into
hysterics
right
to
her
face
she
calls
her
melancholy
dane
and
old
rain
in
the
face
and
all
kinds
of
ridiculous
names
and
annie
simply
has
to
smile
there
is
one
thing
about
page
you
can
always
know
she
is
going
to
say
what
she
got
to
say
right
to
your
face
usually
when
people
are
that
way
their
conversation
is
yea
yea
and
nay
nay
but
page
is
not
that
way
a
bit
dee
and
i
have
had
only
one
bout
and
then
dee
knocked
me
out
it
was
a
funny
thing
the
way
i
let
down
my
guard
but
i
got
to
thinking
about
dimple
in
her
chin
and
how
some
day
i
was
going
to
make
a
stunning
bust
of
her
you
see
dee
looks
mighty
handsome
when
she
boxes
with
her
head
thrown
back
her
neck
like
a
column
i
had
sure
got
her
going
that
day
and
she
had
backed
way
up
in
the
corner
when
the
idea
of
making
the
bust
took
possession
of
me
well
dee
made
a
stunning
bust
of
me
that
all
she
tapped
me
on
the
nose
and
drew
the
claret
the
row
was
all
about
you
dee
said
you
must
be
pretty
near
and
i
said
she
was
all
the
way
a
plumb
idiot
you
were
no
such
thing
and
never
would
be
the
fact
that
she
tapped
me
does
not
prove
that
you
are
or
ever
will
be
any
such
thing
page
came
in
at
the
crucial
moment
and
was
somewhat
shocked
to
see
us
boxing
and
was
broken
up
over
the
gore
but
when
she
heard
what
the
row
was
about
she
sympathized
with
me
and
offered
to
put
on
the
gloves
and
fight
it
out
with
dee
but
she
decided
in
her
amusing
way
to
argue
it
out
instead
she
said
if
the
pen
is
mightier
than
the
sword
surely
the
tongue
is
mightier
than
a
pair
of
boxing
gloves
she
proved
to
dee
perfect
satisfaction
that
age
was
a
matter
of
temperament
and
that
yours
was
eternal
youth
dee
was
convinced
and
offered
the
confessing
herself
beaten
in
argument
i
begin
to
think
trial
by
combat
not
such
a
good
way
of
settling
things
after
all
it
seems
to
me
a
quiet
debate
is
much
the
better
way
write
to
us
soon
i
heard
one
of
the
seniors
say
you
were
the
most
man
she
ever
saw
she
thought
you
were
our
big
brother
and
meant
for
me
to
hear
it
and
of
course
wanted
me
to
repeat
it
to
you
my
darling
old
zebedeedidlums
i
am
sorry
i
made
you
cry
twice
on
the
day
you
brought
us
up
here
your
own
dumplingdeedledums
annie
pore
to
her
father
arthur
pore
price
landing
gresham
my
dear
father
i
am
writing
to
you
at
my
earliest
opportunity
i
made
the
journey
without
any
mishaps
and
in
great
comfort
i
was
astonished
to
find
how
luxurious
traveling
by
rail
is
i
shall
have
to
confess
to
you
that
i
talked
to
some
persons
i
met
on
the
train
they
were
all
of
them
going
to
gresham
and
were
very
kind
to
me
i
found
myself
conversing
with
them
before
i
remembered
your
admonitions
to
be
very
careful
about
making
acquaintances
i
know
in
england
it
is
very
bad
form
but
i
felt
somehow
it
would
have
been
much
worse
form
to
hold
myself
aloof
when
they
were
one
and
all
so
kind
to
me
the
institute
of
gresham
is
admirable
in
every
particular
my
instruction
has
been
so
thorough
thanks
to
your
unceasing
efforts
that
i
find
i
can
take
a
very
good
stand
i
have
not
divulged
that
an
oxford
graduate
has
been
my
teacher
i
am
well
up
in
algebra
latin
and
french
although
my
french
accent
is
not
all
that
it
should
be
miss
cox
the
singing
teacher
takes
a
great
interest
in
my
voice
but
evidently
has
no
personal
feeling
for
me
i
am
very
grateful
to
you
for
the
sacrifices
you
have
made
to
send
me
to
boarding
school
and
am
endeavoring
to
take
advantage
of
every
opportunity
to
perfect
my
education
very
respectfully
annie
de
vere
pore
page
allison
to
her
father
james
allison
milton
gresham
my
dear
old
father
i
can
hardly
believe
it
is
only
a
few
days
since
i
left
bracken
it
seems
ages
and
eons
i
have
a
million
things
to
tell
you
i
made
friends
with
some
delightful
people
on
the
train
jeffry
tucker
and
his
twin
daughters
dum
and
dee
tucker
says
he
knows
you
and
my
eyes
were
so
like
yours
he
came
mighty
near
giving
me
the
fraternity
grip
he
is
the
youngest
man
to
be
grown
up
and
have
almost
daughters
i
ever
saw
their
mother
is
dead
too
so
many
mothers
seem
to
be
dead
we
made
friends
with
another
girl
on
the
train
annie
pore
from
price
landing
she
had
never
been
on
the
train
before
but
although
she
seemed
terribly
shy
and
was
dressed
in
a
most
pathetic
still
she
had
all
the
bearing
and
carriage
of
a
she
is
a
too
and
i
have
a
kind
of
idea
that
her
father
is
not
to
say
so
intimate
with
his
daughter
as
some
other
fathers
who
shall
be
nameless
she
has
been
writing
to
her
paternal
parent
for
the
last
hour
and
she
actually
copied
the
letter
and
seemed
to
be
writing
with
as
much
care
as
though
it
had
to
be
handed
in
you
do
want
me
to
write
that
way
to
you
do
you
gresham
is
splendid
it
is
a
beautiful
building
red
brick
with
great
white
columns
giving
it
the
look
of
a
modern
parthenon
it
is
on
top
of
a
hill
overlooking
the
little
town
and
has
a
beautiful
lawn
with
great
chestnut
trees
and
oaks
but
best
of
all
is
the
view
of
the
mountains
when
it
is
clear
they
seem
quite
close
almost
as
though
we
could
walk
to
them
and
at
other
times
they
disappear
altogether
the
first
day
or
two
the
girls
seemed
to
think
if
they
did
not
do
a
lot
of
bawling
and
blubbering
some
one
might
think
they
did
not
love
their
homes
some
of
them
cried
because
they
could
not
help
it
but
some
of
them
i
verily
believe
rubbed
onions
in
their
eyes
like
the
heartless
sisters
in
beauty
and
the
beast
i
know
no
home
could
be
more
beautiful
than
bracken
and
wager
anything
that
there
is
a
dad
in
the
world
better
or
more
beloved
than
mine
and
was
there
ever
a
mammy
like
mine
i
not
even
mentioning
the
dogs
although
they
are
not
the
least
of
my
blessings
and
still
not
a
visible
tear
have
i
shed
the
first
morning
when
i
waked
up
in
the
strange
room
and
stared
at
the
blank
bare
wall
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
i
simply
could
not
stand
it
i
was
dreaming
about
mammy
susan
i
thought
she
was
pouring
hot
water
into
my
tub
again
my
roommates
were
still
asleep
having
wept
themselves
into
a
state
of
coma
i
have
told
you
that
i
am
rooming
with
dum
and
dee
tucker
and
i
like
it
a
lot
well
i
got
up
and
went
to
the
bathroom
and
had
the
coldest
bath
i
ever
had
in
my
life
and
then
i
dressed
in
a
hurry
i
felt
as
though
i
must
get
out
before
any
one
saw
me
if
i
could
have
a
little
run
maybe
i
could
stave
off
the
great
wave
of
homesickness
that
was
going
to
swallow
me
up
in
a
minute
i
raced
along
the
corridor
i
got
onto
a
covered
walk
connecting
the
dormitory
with
the
main
building
and
there
serene
and
beautiful
were
the
mountains
stretched
before
me
i
did
want
to
cry
any
more
a
feeling
of
deep
peace
and
happiness
came
to
me
i
chanted
aloud
i
will
look
unto
the
hills
from
whence
cometh
my
help
etc
you
must
think
i
do
love
you
and
mammy
susan
just
as
much
as
ever
for
i
do
but
i
am
having
a
good
time
and
am
going
to
learn
a
few
things
and
am
going
to
make
loads
and
loads
of
friends
my
love
to
all
the
dear
dogs
and
please
give
them
an
extra
bone
for
me
and
tell
dear
mammy
susan
that
all
of
us
on
the
train
would
have
starved
to
death
if
she
had
put
up
all
that
good
lunch
i
tell
you
about
what
i
am
studying
in
my
next
letter
your
own
page
chapter
vi
the
foundling
well
miss
peyton
is
some
mobilizer
sighed
dee
as
she
snuggled
down
in
her
bed
after
our
first
study
hall
had
been
lived
through
at
gresham
just
to
think
here
we
are
hard
at
work
when
we
have
been
here
only
two
days
well
i
glad
for
one
said
dum
if
they
work
us
hard
enough
we
wo
get
that
what
dee
and
i
call
homesick
wherever
zebedee
is
is
home
for
us
my
father
and
bracken
and
mammy
susan
and
the
dogs
are
so
mixed
up
in
my
mind
that
i
ca
tell
what
or
which
or
whom
i
miss
most
and
i
scrambled
into
bed
in
a
great
hurry
just
as
the
bell
rang
to
warn
us
that
lights
must
be
out
in
five
minutes
i
had
not
been
hours
with
other
girls
before
i
had
learned
many
things
that
girls
know
one
of
them
was
that
the
last
one
up
has
the
chores
to
do
such
as
raising
the
window
at
the
bottom
and
pulling
it
down
at
the
top
a
mighty
chilly
performance
when
clothed
in
nothing
but
a
nightgown
also
the
tardy
one
has
the
light
to
put
out
oh
you
foxy
creatures
cried
dum
i
bet
you
have
cleaned
your
teeth
you
been
in
such
a
hurry
to
beat
me
to
bed
we
have
we
declared
while
you
were
calling
on
annie
pore
you
have
said
your
prayers
then
persisted
dum
i
have
i
said
but
dee
had
neglected
this
means
of
grace
and
had
to
crawl
out
of
her
nice
warm
bed
and
she
and
dum
knelt
together
there
was
silence
for
about
three
minutes
then
dum
bounced
into
bed
and
pulled
the
covers
up
to
her
square
chin
there
she
lay
with
eyes
closed
dum
tucker
you
skipped
something
i
do
believe
you
said
a
single
thing
but
and
dee
stood
over
her
sister
like
an
avenging
angel
what
it
to
you
yawned
dum
that
a
matter
between
me
and
my
conscience
open
the
window
and
turn
out
the
light
and
crawl
into
bed
before
our
room
gets
reported
well
it
was
a
matter
between
my
conscience
and
me
whether
i
said
my
prayers
at
all
and
you
went
and
butt
in
on
us
now
you
take
that
toploftical
stand
about
you
and
your
conscience
well
you
and
your
conscience
can
just
lie
on
the
floor
together
with
which
tirade
dee
yanked
dum
and
all
her
bed
clothes
out
on
the
floor
she
then
whisked
off
the
light
and
quickly
raising
the
window
jumped
into
bed
i
wondered
what
would
be
the
outcome
of
this
battle
and
if
it
would
have
to
be
settled
according
to
the
tuckers
code
of
honor
a
duel
with
boxing
gloves
but
just
then
there
was
a
sharp
rap
on
the
door
less
noise
please
said
a
determined
voice
outside
or
i
shall
have
to
report
to
the
principal
dum
lay
on
the
floor
convulsed
with
giggles
i
warned
be
careful
or
we
all
have
to
write
pages
from
the
dictionary
for
two
hours
you
wo
have
to
surely
when
dum
and
i
made
all
the
racket
whispered
dee
the
teacher
said
and
that
means
me
too
can
you
get
back
into
bed
is
the
foot
untucked
i
believe
i
can
if
i
do
start
giggling
again
and
dum
began
to
squirm
out
of
the
covers
let
me
help
said
the
penitent
dee
and
dum
was
soon
back
in
her
cot
and
silence
reigned
supreme
after
a
while
i
heard
dum
whisper
say
dee
i
did
skip
conscience
bids
me
confess
to
thee
well
dum
i
give
it
to
you
that
you
and
your
conscience
are
perfect
gentlemen
said
dee
admiringly
thanks
awfully
yawned
dum
i
know
one
thing
i
a
mighty
sleepy
gentleman
and
in
a
trice
the
quiet
breathing
from
the
disheveled
bed
told
that
dum
and
her
conscience
were
at
rest
there
were
constant
surprises
in
store
for
one
who
shared
a
room
with
the
tucker
twins
they
certainly
had
the
gift
of
infinite
variety
in
the
kind
of
scrapes
they
could
get
themselves
into
they
usually
got
out
of
scrapes
as
easily
as
they
got
into
them
by
a
certain
frankness
and
directness
that
would
disarm
miss
peyton
herself
they
did
break
rules
because
they
did
things
that
nobody
had
ever
thought
of
making
rules
about
the
principal
at
gresham
was
not
so
farseeing
as
the
teacher
in
mary
had
a
little
lamb
who
seems
to
have
made
a
rule
about
lambs
in
school
it
followed
her
to
school
one
day
which
was
against
the
rule
it
made
the
children
laugh
and
play
to
see
a
lamb
in
school
one
day
when
we
were
taking
a
sedate
walk
the
school
out
in
full
force
with
two
teachers
to
keep
order
along
the
lines
we
saw
by
the
roadside
a
little
kitten
so
young
its
eyes
were
hardly
open
poor
little
foundling
i
wonder
where
it
came
from
i
like
to
pick
him
up
ejaculated
several
of
the
girls
but
dee
tucker
was
the
one
who
acted
she
was
bringing
up
the
rear
with
miss
sears
the
latin
teacher
as
they
were
passing
the
forlorn
little
feline
miss
sears
stepped
forward
to
admonish
a
couple
who
were
talking
too
loudly
dee
stooped
and
quickly
scooped
into
her
muff
the
poor
pussy
no
one
saw
her
and
kitty
very
considerately
said
nothing
he
lay
there
warm
and
contented
dreaming
he
was
back
with
his
soft
loving
mother
and
forgetting
the
rude
hand
that
had
put
him
into
a
bag
with
his
brothers
and
sisters
the
bag
had
had
a
merciful
hole
and
he
being
the
runt
of
the
family
had
fallen
through
before
the
proposed
drowning
came
off
we
marched
on
all
unconscious
of
the
addition
to
our
ranks
when
we
got
back
to
school
and
went
up
to
our
room
to
take
off
our
hats
i
noticed
that
dee
had
very
shining
eyes
and
her
dimple
seemed
to
be
deeper
but
she
did
not
divulge
to
dum
and
me
what
she
had
up
her
sleeve
or
rather
her
muff
i
also
noticed
at
supper
that
she
swiped
some
bread
and
very
adroitly
concealed
it
in
her
middy
blouse
she
also
very
cleverly
called
the
attention
of
every
one
at
our
table
to
the
autumn
moon
that
was
peeping
into
the
dining
room
window
and
while
they
were
looking
the
other
way
she
filled
a
little
vial
with
milk
from
her
glass
naturally
i
said
nothing
but
adopted
the
watchful
waiting
attitude
certain
that
sooner
or
later
i
find
out
what
dee
was
up
to
and
i
did
all
right
after
supper
we
had
an
hour
before
study
hall
which
we
usually
spent
in
the
gymnasium
dancing
dum
and
dee
had
undertaken
to
teach
annie
pore
and
me
the
new
dances
all
dances
were
new
to
poor
annie
and
me
i
could
cut
the
pigeon
wing
and
dance
goin
to
church
which
is
a
negro
classic
but
the
tango
and
maxixe
with
all
of
the
intricate
steps
and
seemed
very
difficult
but
i
must
learn
and
learn
i
did
as
for
annie
her
sense
of
rhythm
was
so
great
that
she
took
to
dancing
as
a
duck
does
to
water
she
had
to
get
over
a
certain
that
was
her
ruling
fault
but
when
the
victrola
was
started
in
one
of
the
tunes
that
would
make
a
dead
darkey
want
to
get
up
and
pat
why
annie
would
forget
all
about
annie
and
her
clothes
and
would
sway
to
the
music
with
the
utmost
abandon
i
believe
i
have
forgotten
to
tell
whom
annie
got
for
a
roommate
it
was
none
other
than
josephine
barr
the
dressy
senior
for
whom
miss
sayre
felt
so
sorry
because
of
her
great
wealth
i
fancy
jo
as
we
soon
called
her
was
not
very
well
pleased
at
first
at
having
to
share
a
room
with
such
a
seemingly
dismal
person
but
it
was
either
annie
or
mabel
binks
as
all
the
other
rooms
were
filled
and
jo
had
not
registered
in
time
to
have
much
choice
she
could
bear
mabel
binks
and
she
did
feel
sorry
for
the
poor
little
new
girl
who
seemed
so
ready
to
dissolve
into
tears
jo
was
the
best
old
thing
in
the
world
with
a
heart
as
big
as
all
outdoors
and
an
optimistic
nature
that
was
bound
to
influence
annie
and
make
her
more
cheerful
at
the
same
time
annie
breeding
and
careful
speech
had
its
good
effect
on
the
husky
jo
before
the
year
was
up
they
were
as
intimate
as
a
senior
and
sophomore
could
be
on
that
famous
evening
which
was
afterward
known
as
the
kitten
evening
dee
kept
disappearing
between
dances
she
would
come
back
flushed
and
a
little
but
would
go
on
with
the
dance
with
a
expression
study
hour
in
the
assembly
hall
from
eight
to
ten
and
then
half
an
hour
to
get
to
bed
before
the
bell
rang
for
lights
out
that
was
the
order
of
procedure
as
we
studied
i
noticed
how
dee
kept
fidgeting
and
twisting
dum
noticed
it
too
and
the
fidgets
seemed
to
be
catching
we
were
on
our
honor
not
to
speak
during
study
hour
and
of
course
that
settled
the
matter
for
the
tuckers
and
me
dee
could
squirm
herself
into
a
bowknot
and
dum
and
i
could
die
of
curiosity
and
still
honor
forbade
our
making
a
sign
to
find
out
what
was
the
matter
i
never
spent
such
a
long
and
unprofitable
two
hours
in
my
life
i
tried
to
concentrate
my
attention
on
my
lessons
but
it
was
impossible
with
dee
at
the
desk
in
front
of
me
never
still
a
minute
the
bell
at
last
exclaimed
dee
well
your
lessons
have
been
reeling
and
writhing
dee
tucker
i
never
saw
such
a
wiggler
in
my
life
but
dee
was
off
like
a
whirlwind
without
a
word
to
dum
and
me
she
did
even
take
her
books
with
her
or
gather
up
the
scattered
papers
that
were
strewn
over
her
desk
we
mercifully
saved
her
some
demerits
by
putting
things
in
order
for
her
what
do
you
reckon
is
up
with
dee
said
dum
anxiously
she
is
either
brewing
some
mischief
or
is
already
in
a
scrape
we
found
the
door
to
carefully
closed
and
dee
already
in
bed
how
she
ever
managed
to
get
in
so
rapidly
i
could
not
see
unless
she
followed
the
plan
of
diddle
diddle
dumpling
my
son
john
now
dee
tucker
what
is
the
matter
with
you
begged
dum
anxiously
the
matter
with
me
said
dee
with
feigned
coolness
nothing
on
earth
my
dear
sister
what
should
be
the
matter
with
me
i
am
simply
sleepy
and
thought
i
would
get
into
bed
how
about
your
teeth
and
your
prayers
cleaned
and
said
said
dee
laconically
and
she
turned
over
rather
gingerly
i
noticed
and
pretended
to
have
fallen
into
a
deep
sleep
she
wo
be
able
to
keep
it
to
herself
very
long
whispered
dum
to
me
if
it
is
any
fun
she
ca
be
low
enough
not
to
share
it
and
if
it
is
trouble
of
some
sort
she
is
sure
to
let
us
in
on
it
i
take
the
motto
of
prosper
le
gai
bide
my
time
respecting
dee
evident
desire
for
silence
dum
and
i
went
very
quietly
to
bed
and
had
the
light
out
long
before
it
was
time
a
knock
at
the
door
come
in
called
dum
it
was
annie
pore
very
apologetic
at
disturbing
us
it
is
ten
minutes
before
lights
out
bell
i
had
no
idea
you
had
all
gone
to
bed
i
was
worried
about
dee
is
she
all
right
she
looked
so
feverish
oh
yes
she
all
right
just
sleepy
said
dum
politely
thank
you
all
the
same
annie
annie
softly
closed
the
door
i
heard
strange
sounds
from
dee
bed
but
could
not
tell
whether
she
was
laughing
or
crying
another
knock
come
in
a
little
wearily
from
dum
miss
jane
cox
this
time
oh
girls
excuse
me
i
did
not
know
you
were
in
bed
i
was
a
little
anxious
about
dee
a
snore
from
dee
bed
rather
melodramatic
in
tone
she
seemed
so
upset
during
study
hour
i
was
on
duty
and
i
did
not
know
whether
she
needed
castor
oil
or
a
demerit
the
snoring
stopped
the
snorer
was
evidently
deliberating
i
think
she
is
all
right
now
miss
cox
i
ventured
she
went
right
off
to
bed
as
soon
as
study
hour
was
over
maybe
she
wo
have
to
have
either
demerit
or
oil
my
private
opinion
is
she
had
a
flea
down
her
back
but
she
says
she
was
just
tired
and
sleepy
a
gratified
snore
from
dee
and
miss
cox
with
a
little
snicker
went
to
her
room
night
sable
goddess
from
her
ebon
throne
now
stretches
forth
a
leaden
scepter
a
slumbering
world
lights
out
bell
had
rung
and
the
girls
all
along
the
corridors
in
carter
hall
had
gone
to
bed
and
to
sleep
i
had
a
feeling
of
impending
something
not
necessarily
evil
but
excitement
at
least
dum
was
breathing
gently
and
regularly
like
a
sleeping
infant
dee
stirred
every
now
and
then
and
occasionally
muttered
an
unintelligible
something
i
dozed
but
waked
with
a
start
mieuw
mieuw
mieuw
came
in
a
wail
from
dee
bed
poor
ittle
titty
puss
do
you
cwy
honey
child
shhh
mieuw
more
subdued
endearments
from
dee
dum
slept
on
but
i
heard
a
door
open
way
down
the
hall
some
teacher
with
sharp
ears
no
doubt
dee
i
whispered
put
your
little
finger
in
its
mouth
and
let
it
suck
until
that
busybody
down
the
hall
goes
back
into
her
room
there
was
the
sound
of
a
door
closing
what
is
your
advice
page
have
you
anything
for
it
to
eat
bread
and
milk
but
it
wo
eat
of
course
not
it
is
too
little
did
you
warm
the
milk
i
inquired
no
how
could
i
with
no
stove
one
of
the
rules
of
the
institution
was
no
alcohol
stoves
wait
a
minute
i
got
a
candle
that
mammy
susan
put
in
my
bag
in
case
of
accidents
how
i
blessed
the
kind
old
woman
who
had
thought
of
everything
them
newfangled
lights
may
be
mighty
fine
but
if
they
not
to
wuck
some
night
a
good
ole
tallow
come
in
mighty
handy
chile
also
some
saftest
matches
she
had
said
as
she
overrode
all
my
objections
and
tucked
the
candle
and
matches
in
my
already
overworked
grip
i
got
up
donned
slippers
and
dressing
gown
gently
closed
the
window
as
the
night
was
decidedly
frosty
and
found
the
matches
and
candle
we
did
not
dare
to
light
the
electric
light
because
of
the
transom
over
the
door
pussy
might
at
any
moment
let
out
another
wail
and
then
the
wakeful
teacher
seeing
the
light
would
make
for
our
room
in
feeling
for
the
table
i
touched
dum
foot
and
she
waked
with
a
start
what
the
matter
dee
are
you
sick
and
dum
sat
up
in
bed
shhh
no
dum
she
not
sick
but
the
little
kitty
is
hungry
i
whispered
the
is
hungry
not
so
loud
dum
dear
please
it
just
a
poor
miserable
little
foundling
of
a
kitty
puss
that
i
simply
could
not
leave
by
the
roadside
i
got
it
in
bed
with
me
here
oh
caroline
tucker
a
nasty
little
cat
in
bed
with
you
what
would
zebedee
say
and
dum
sniffed
the
air
disdainfully
he
would
say
just
what
i
say
virginia
tucker
that
it
is
a
mighty
funny
thing
that
you
who
were
in
line
before
me
and
must
have
seen
the
poor
little
wretched
kitten
first
did
feel
it
your
duty
to
rescue
it
from
its
misery
i
am
ashamed
of
you
belonging
to
the
too
and
dee
gave
her
little
charge
a
brand
new
finger
to
suck
things
were
looking
rather
serious
dum
and
dee
calling
one
another
virginia
and
caroline
and
that
in
no
modulated
tones
and
the
candle
making
such
a
bright
light
that
i
expected
every
minute
to
hear
a
teacher
rapping
on
our
door
now
look
here
tweedles
both
of
you
stop
your
fussing
and
to
the
business
in
hand
you
can
fight
it
out
but
for
sake
put
all
of
your
surplus
energy
now
on
getting
the
kitten
fed
and
quiet
and
not
in
a
deluge
of
demerits
dum
get
up
and
pin
two
middy
ties
over
the
transom
dum
obediently
carried
out
my
instructions
while
i
warmed
the
milk
that
dee
had
purloined
from
the
supper
table
over
the
blessed
candle
i
sweetened
it
a
little
and
diluted
it
with
water
i
warmed
it
in
silver
as
we
had
no
pan
of
any
sort
dip
your
finger
in
here
dee
and
let
the
kitten
taste
it
so
it
can
realize
succor
is
near
it
is
lots
too
young
to
lap
and
will
have
to
suck
a
rag
dum
tore
up
an
old
handkerchief
for
me
and
in
a
little
while
kitty
was
tugging
away
for
dear
life
one
end
of
the
bit
of
cambric
in
its
pink
flannel
mouth
and
the
other
in
the
of
milk
dum
was
soon
won
over
to
the
helpless
little
thing
it
is
sweet
dee
i
declare
let
me
hold
it
a
minute
dee
magnanimously
handed
it
over
to
her
sister
who
held
the
very
carefully
and
let
kitty
feed
as
tenderly
as
any
young
mother
it
soon
got
its
fill
and
curled
up
and
purred
just
like
a
fairy
dum
declared
to
think
of
a
tiny
cat
like
that
knowing
how
to
purr
exclaimed
dee
to
think
of
a
tiny
cat
like
that
having
such
enormous
fleas
on
it
shuddered
dum
here
take
the
beastie
i
going
back
to
bed
before
i
get
full
of
yes
they
are
something
awful
sighed
dee
i
am
literally
eaten
alive
poor
old
dee
change
your
nightgown
and
leave
your
bed
to
the
pussy
and
come
snuggle
in
with
me
said
dum
pussy
slept
very
well
in
dee
bed
waking
only
about
every
two
hours
and
mewing
for
nourishment
dee
and
i
would
get
wearily
up
warm
the
milk
and
administer
oh
who
could
be
a
cat
with
kittens
sighed
dee
morning
finally
came
and
the
problem
of
what
to
do
with
our
adopted
child
had
to
be
faced
do
you
know
what
i
do
if
i
were
you
dee
i
go
right
to
miss
peyton
and
tell
her
all
about
it
i
go
with
you
she
would
sympathize
with
you
i
really
believe
and
help
you
find
a
home
for
pussy
i
said
i
go
too
cried
dum
miss
peyton
was
fine
she
seemed
to
think
dee
had
merely
been
imprudent
not
at
all
naughty
she
agreed
with
dee
that
it
was
a
strange
thing
that
the
whole
line
of
girls
and
teachers
should
have
passed
the
little
waif
by
girls
i
am
proud
and
happy
that
you
should
have
felt
i
was
the
person
to
confide
in
if
all
the
school
could
only
understand
that
i
am
their
friend
and
not
just
the
principal
and
dealer
in
demerits
of
course
you
ca
keep
the
kitten
in
your
room
but
i
will
see
that
a
good
home
is
found
for
it
with
someone
who
will
take
the
trouble
to
feed
it
until
it
can
lap
for
itself
i
think
i
know
exactly
the
right
person
in
the
village
we
went
from
the
principal
office
in
very
happy
and
exalted
states
of
mind
is
she
wonderful
exclaimed
dee
was
she
splendid
to
us
she
was
fine
enthused
dum
i
am
certainly
relieved
i
said
to
myself
miss
peyton
was
awfully
nice
but
it
is
plain
to
be
seen
she
is
fond
of
cats
i
wonder
how
she
would
have
felt
if
it
had
been
an
orphan
snake
or
an
abused
chapter
vii
kitty
tweedles
and
i
were
excused
from
the
gym
exercises
that
afternoon
with
the
request
that
we
meet
miss
peyton
in
her
office
at
three
we
were
there
on
time
you
may
be
sure
and
dee
had
the
kitty
all
done
up
in
a
shoe
box
ready
for
the
trip
we
had
christened
him
oliver
twist
because
he
kept
on
hollering
for
more
all
the
weary
night
miss
peyton
laughed
until
the
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
over
the
description
of
our
trials
during
the
night
when
we
found
out
that
she
did
not
think
it
was
so
terribly
wicked
of
dee
we
felt
we
could
tell
her
everything
even
the
middy
ties
over
the
transom
and
the
fleas
in
dee
bed
you
poor
girls
must
be
nearly
dead
are
you
she
asked
kindly
page
and
i
feel
right
but
after
the
first
feeding
dum
slept
through
it
all
laughed
dee
i
have
more
sympathy
than
ever
for
poor
zebedee
that
what
we
call
our
father
you
know
miss
peyton
he
had
to
bring
up
dum
and
me
on
bottles
as
our
little
mother
died
when
we
were
tiny
babies
if
one
kitten
could
keep
two
girls
awake
most
of
the
night
heating
milk
for
it
do
you
fancy
two
twins
like
dum
and
me
could
keep
one
man
awake
all
the
time
did
you
have
a
nurse
i
asked
of
course
we
did
all
kinds
and
colors
but
dum
and
i
would
drink
unless
zebedee
gave
us
the
bottles
he
says
he
was
afraid
the
nurse
might
not
be
sanitary
and
trusted
no
one
but
himself
to
fix
the
milk
poor
old
zebedee
sighed
dum
her
eyes
filling
i
do
see
how
we
could
have
been
so
mean
to
him
we
had
started
on
our
quest
for
a
friend
for
kitty
miss
peyton
leading
the
way
down
toward
the
village
she
seemed
to
be
enjoying
the
little
outing
as
much
as
we
were
your
father
must
be
very
patient
she
said
putting
her
arm
in
when
she
saw
the
hazel
eyes
filling
at
the
thought
of
her
father
well
the
funny
part
of
it
is
he
is
not
one
bit
patient
except
with
dee
and
me
do
you
know
once
he
got
dreadfully
mad
with
the
telephone
girl
who
kept
on
cutting
him
off
when
he
was
in
the
midst
of
some
most
important
business
that
could
not
wait
and
every
time
he
would
try
to
get
connection
again
the
operator
would
say
busy
now
he
knew
the
line
was
not
busy
and
the
person
on
the
other
end
was
just
as
anxious
to
be
got
as
he
was
to
get
him
and
as
i
was
saying
he
got
so
mad
he
pulled
the
telephone
out
by
the
roots
well
that
was
to
say
the
least
impulsive
and
miss
peyton
laughed
like
any
schoolgirl
you
must
think
zebedee
is
put
in
dee
he
got
the
sweetest
disposition
in
the
world
he
just
he
has
learned
to
control
himself
wonderfully
but
you
know
he
is
real
young
yet
yes
i
know
said
miss
peyton
solemnly
tell
us
whom
you
are
going
to
get
to
be
kitty
foster
father
miss
peyton
i
said
purposely
changing
the
subject
not
that
i
did
not
take
the
keenest
interest
in
everything
pertaining
to
tucker
but
i
could
see
that
the
twins
were
both
getting
leaky
and
it
did
seem
a
pity
to
have
a
cloud
cast
over
our
delightful
walk
with
miss
peyton
indeed
i
will
she
said
giving
me
an
approving
nod
it
is
dear
old
captain
pat
leahy
i
hope
you
girls
will
like
him
as
much
as
i
do
he
is
sure
to
like
you
of
course
he
may
not
be
able
to
keep
the
little
thing
and
then
i
do
know
what
we
will
do
anyhow
let
not
borrow
trouble
i
know
the
dear
man
will
do
it
for
me
if
he
possibly
can
when
i
first
came
to
gresham
as
a
pupil
oh
were
you
a
pupil
here
we
exclaimed
in
one
breath
yes
indeed
i
came
here
before
i
went
to
college
gresham
had
not
such
a
grand
building
then
and
accommodated
only
about
fifty
girls
it
was
more
like
a
home
school
captain
leahy
was
then
conductor
on
the
local
train
and
took
an
especial
interest
in
the
gresham
girls
i
shall
never
forget
how
good
he
was
to
me
on
my
first
trip
i
was
lonesome
and
shy
you
shy
oh
miss
peyton
were
you
really
i
should
say
i
was
why
annie
pore
is
brazen
beside
what
i
was
as
a
child
captain
leahy
sat
by
me
between
stations
and
with
his
ready
irish
tongue
cheered
me
up
immensely
he
treated
me
to
peanuts
and
made
me
laugh
and
gave
me
a
new
outlook
on
life
the
poor
fellow
lost
a
leg
in
a
railroad
accident
about
ten
years
ago
and
ever
since
then
has
kept
the
gate
where
the
track
crosses
the
main
street
of
gresham
does
he
like
cats
i
asked
oh
yes
he
adores
them
that
is
the
great
bond
of
sympathy
between
us
he
loves
cats
and
he
loves
flowers
he
also
has
a
great
fondness
for
young
people
here
we
are
and
miss
peyton
pointed
out
the
where
her
old
friend
lived
it
was
just
an
ordinary
little
square
box
of
a
house
painted
the
pumpkin
yellow
that
railroads
are
so
partial
to
but
all
around
it
were
window
boxes
some
of
them
filled
with
geraniums
some
with
norway
spruces
and
english
ivy
a
moon
flower
had
completely
covered
one
side
of
the
little
house
but
the
frost
had
touched
the
big
leaves
and
they
were
dropping
off
one
by
one
a
grizzled
old
man
with
a
long
red
beard
and
a
peg
leg
was
digging
around
the
geraniums
as
we
approached
captain
i
have
brought
some
of
my
girls
to
meet
you
said
miss
peyton
holding
out
her
hand
to
the
old
man
and
introducing
us
and
i
am
that
proud
to
meet
all
of
yez
and
so
will
me
cats
be
the
poor
critters
long
for
some
petticoats
to
cuddle
oop
to
a
peg
leg
is
but
cold
comfort
to
a
pussy
when
she
is
hankering
for
some
women
folk
and
with
a
hearty
laugh
the
old
fellow
stumped
to
the
door
of
his
little
and
called
to
the
cats
out
they
came
seven
in
all
and
a
motley
crew
the
captain
was
very
democratic
and
not
particular
about
the
pedigree
of
his
friends
all
cats
are
aristocratic
if
you
just
give
a
chance
he
would
declare
when
some
cat
snob
would
suggest
that
he
go
in
for
pure
breeds
six
of
the
cats
came
to
him
and
rubbed
their
backs
against
his
good
leg
but
the
seventh
a
large
gray
one
with
a
mournful
look
in
her
eyes
began
to
sharpen
her
claws
on
a
long
strip
of
sand
paper
he
had
tacked
to
his
wooden
leg
we
burst
out
laughing
it
was
the
most
comical
thing
i
had
ever
seen
a
little
invintion
of
me
own
there
are
no
trees
handy
for
the
poor
critters
to
sharpen
their
claws
on
and
i
find
this
device
saves
me
furniture
many
a
scratch
he
stooped
and
laid
his
hand
lovingly
on
the
mournful
one
but
she
arched
her
back
and
moved
over
to
the
protection
of
dee
skirts
what
schtill
angry
wid
me
poor
bett
i
had
to
have
her
kittens
drowned
all
but
one
and
she
ca
forgive
me
not
that
i
blame
her
but
what
am
i
to
do
miss
peyton
me
house
is
schmall
and
bett
is
that
prolific
she
could
furnish
kittens
for
all
the
ould
maids
in
christendom
in
little
or
no
toime
well
it
is
a
problem
captain
leahy
but
i
am
sorry
for
bett
there
enough
old
maids
in
gresham
to
help
you
out
some
miss
peyton
stooped
down
and
picked
up
the
poor
bereaved
mother
who
nestled
comfortably
in
her
arms
and
began
to
purr
loudly
the
demand
does
come
oop
to
bett
supply
niver
in
the
world
laughed
the
old
man
but
what
am
i
thinking
of
keeping
yez
waiting
out
here
so
long
come
in
come
in
i
have
never
heard
such
a
rich
delicious
voice
as
captain
leahy
and
his
brogue
was
as
soft
as
the
purr
of
his
cats
before
we
go
in
i
might
as
well
tell
you
what
has
brought
us
to
you
especially
captain
said
miss
peyton
what
you
must
schnatch
me
from
me
fool
paradise
i
was
after
thinking
all
the
time
you
had
come
to
see
the
ould
man
himself
and
his
eyes
twinkled
mischievously
so
we
did
dear
captain
we
have
come
to
see
you
because
you
are
you
and
we
need
your
help
answered
miss
peyton
with
her
engaging
smile
that
somehow
made
one
feel
that
her
way
was
the
best
way
well
sitting
is
as
cheap
as
standing
and
i
want
this
peg
leg
to
last
as
long
as
i
do
it
is
astonishing
how
fast
they
wear
out
come
in
come
in
and
tell
me
what
it
is
you
want
me
to
help
yez
about
and
he
led
the
way
into
his
little
house
it
did
not
seem
so
small
when
you
got
in
because
it
was
so
orderly
the
lower
berth
from
a
wrecked
pullman
served
him
as
seat
by
day
and
bed
by
night
the
very
smallest
cooking
stove
imaginable
almost
a
doll
baby
size
polished
like
the
boots
of
a
dandy
was
at
one
side
over
it
was
a
shelf
with
some
blue
and
white
china
on
it
and
under
the
shelf
a
few
cooking
utensils
and
a
dish
pan
and
biscuit
board
sit
down
sit
down
and
while
the
kittle
is
biling
for
tay
i
can
listen
to
your
trroobles
we
seated
ourselves
on
the
pullman
seat
while
the
dear
old
man
busied
himself
with
the
tea
kettle
bett
the
bereaved
mother
still
nestled
in
miss
peyton
arms
but
after
a
moment
she
wriggled
out
and
got
into
the
box
behind
the
stove
you
better
look
after
your
baby
you
ould
rip
i
thinking
these
ladies
are
that
fond
of
cats
that
they
might
be
making
off
wid
it
that
just
it
captain
leahy
these
ladies
are
fond
of
cats
one
of
them
especially
indicating
dee
so
fond
of
them
that
yesterday
when
the
whole
school
was
out
on
the
valley
road
taking
the
dignified
walk
that
is
required
what
should
miss
caroline
tucker
do
but
rescue
a
poor
little
lost
kitten
mewing
by
the
roadside
carry
it
home
in
her
muff
without
teacher
or
fellow
pupil
seeing
her
and
actually
take
it
to
bed
with
her
but
girls
you
tell
captain
leahy
about
it
yourselves
which
we
did
at
miss
peyton
command
he
enjoyed
the
prank
as
much
as
miss
peyton
and
laughed
until
the
blue
and
white
china
danced
on
the
little
shelf
and
now
i
know
very
well
what
ye
have
come
for
ye
want
me
to
take
a
boarder
oh
will
you
please
implored
dee
bett
having
nourished
her
lone
offspring
now
carried
it
in
her
mouth
for
miss
peyton
inspection
and
dee
seeing
her
jumped
up
in
great
excitement
dropping
the
box
she
had
been
holding
so
carefully
and
waking
up
oliver
twist
in
the
fall
look

bett
kitten

just
like
oliver
i
thought
it
was
him
at
first
dee

excited
and
we
all
excused
her
english
oliver
began
to
cry
aloud
and
bett
tore
around
like
one
demented
well
bett
old
girl
your
baby
has
been
restored
to
yez
if
this
beat
all
on
the
valley
road
yesterday
you
say
i
told
that
boy
to
be
careful
of
the
hole
in
the
bag
that
the
runt
might
fall
through
it
and
so
he
did
you
call
him
oliver
you
say
well
that
is
a
handsome
name
for
such
a
poor
mite
but
maybe
it
will
give
him
some
ambition
to
grow
oop
to
it
there
an
ould
saying
you
escape
drowning
you
live
to
be
hanged
i
hope
not
oliver
i
hope
not
now
bett
having
one
of
her
babies
back
forgave
her
master
and
rubbed
herself
against
his
good
leg
and
then
such
another
washing
as
she
did
give
oliver
before
she
considered
him
fit
to
get
into
the
box
that
she
called
home
the
kettle
was
boiling
and
the
tea
soon
steeping
in
the
pretty
teapot
the
captain
put
up
a
little
table
exactly
like
the
ones
on
the
train
and
we
had
the
merriest
kind
of
a
party
your
cats
are
so
fat
captain
what
do
you
feed
them
on
asked
dee
in
her
element
with
two
cats
in
her
lap
an
ould
frind
of
mine
who
is
schteward
on
a
diner
saves
me
all
the
schraps
and
the
cats
live
high
higher
than
their
master
by
a
long
shot
but
do
you
know
the
windfall
i
have
had
lately
miss
peyton
no
do
tell
me
i
am
so
glad
of
any
good
fortune
that
comes
to
you
captain
bless
your
schwate
heart
for
thim
words
well
i
have
always
had
a
hard
toime
about
my
shoes
since
i
lost
me
limb
such
an
accumulation
of
rights
as
you
never
saw
wid
no
one
wanting
of
thim
and
no
place
to
put
thim
and
feeling
it
was
to
say
the
least
a
sin
to
be
throwing
thim
away
when
no
doubt
there
was
somewhere
in
the
worrld
a
man
who
had
lost
his
lift
leg
who
would
give
anything
for
thim
well
i
came
on
this
advertisement
in
a
washington
paper
man
who
has
lost
his
left
leg
would
like
to
get
into
communication
with
one
who
has
lost
his
right
i
knew
soon
as
i
clapped
eyes
on
it
that
some
poor
fellow
was
in
exactly
me
own
dilimma
i
did
get
into
communication
wid
him
and
now
i
am
no
longer
trying
to
find
a
place
for
the
right
shoes
i
have
no
use
for
and
on
the
other
hand
i
have
enough
of
the
lifts
to
last
me
a
lifetime
e
too
exactly
my
size
well
that
was
a
windfall
surely
said
miss
peyton
more
like
a
footfall
muttered
dum
but
captain
i
thought
you
were
going
to
buy
a
fine
jointed
leg
with
a
foot
and
then
you
would
need
your
own
right
shoes
oh
i
have
given
oop
the
notion
you
see
my
cats
would
miss
the
peg
something
awful
wid
no
place
to
sharpen
their
little
claws
and
thin
i
have
found
a
poor
widdy
woman
living
down
the
track
a
piece
and
the
right
leg
of
me
pants
do
come
in
so
handy
for
the
poor
thing
to
make
schuits
for
her
little
byes
it
would
seem
a
sin
to
use
that
warm
cloth
to
cover
cork
whin
some
poor
little
lamb
is
shivering
in
the
cold
ah
captain
always
thinking
how
you
can
be
good
to
children
and
cats
said
miss
peyton
then
with
many
thanks
to
the
old
irishman
for
his
hospitality
and
his
kindness
and
the
good
time
he
had
given
us
we
took
our
departure
i
noticed
that
dum
who
had
been
very
quiet
and
whose
eyes
had
been
misty
several
times
especially
when
the
captain
told
of
the
fate
of
his
trouser
legs
stepped
back
into
the
little
house
and
i
heard
her
whisper
to
the
old
man
please
captain
take
this
half
dollar
and
buy
some
toys
for
the
little
lambs
who
wear
the
pant
legs
i
happened
to
know
it
was
the
whole
of
her
week
allowance
too
chapter
viii
about
mathematics
and
me
i
was
a
very
difficult
pupil
to
place
having
been
overeducated
in
some
subjects
and
absolutely
neglected
in
others
i
might
have
gone
with
the
seniors
in
english
and
history
was
normal
in
latin
that
is
sophomore
where
girls
of
my
age
were
put
was
just
beginning
french
and
had
to
go
with
the
kids
in
mathematics
i
had
never
played
a
game
of
tennis
in
my
life
nor
even
seen
a
game
of
basketball
but
i
was
naturally
athletic
from
the
free
country
life
i
had
led
and
it
was
soon
realized
in
athletic
circles
that
i
would
be
on
the
team
with
a
little
coaching
i
was
glad
to
see
that
miss
cox
was
to
teach
me
arithmetic
miss
peyton
hoped
i
could
get
into
algebra
by
christmas
and
then
with
hard
study
and
earnest
coaching
perhaps
catch
up
with
the
class
i
had
a
feeling
that
miss
cox
and
i
were
going
to
pull
together
if
she
could
just
let
herself
go
her
manner
in
the
class
was
rather
wooden
but
she
was
an
excellent
teacher
and
the
girls
were
quick
to
recognize
that
so
while
she
was
not
popular
she
was
not
disliked
i
was
such
a
stupid
in
mathematics
that
i
was
afraid
she
might
put
me
down
as
a
dunce
and
lose
all
interest
in
me
but
the
fact
that
i
read
alice
in
wonderland
seemed
to
be
in
my
favor
page
i
will
not
have
you
look
upon
yourself
as
hopeless
in
arithmetic
she
said
to
me
one
day
when
i
despaired
of
ever
understanding
what
seemed
to
me
a
very
intricate
problem
lewis
carroll
was
a
great
mathematician
and
still
he
wrote
the
delicious
classic
that
you
and
i
are
so
fond
of
now
i
think
minds
that
appreciate
the
same
things
must
be
similar
i
believe
there
is
a
corner
of
your
brain
that
is
absolutely
unexplored
and
that
corner
corresponds
to
the
great
fertile
area
in
lewis
carroll
all
it
needs
in
you
is
working
digging
cultivating
to
produce
fruit
oh
miss
cox
how
splendid
of
you
to
look
at
it
that
way
i
am
going
to
try
awfully
hard
to
work
my
poor
little
neglected
unused
plot
of
brain
with
all
my
might
if
i
ca
grow
anything
but
green
persimmons
that
would
be
better
than
nothing
ambition
distraction
uglification
and
derision
are
the
hard
things
if
you
look
at
it
right
one
side
of
mathematics
is
really
romantic
father
always
said
the
way
to
control
me
was
through
my
imagination
and
miss
cox
had
surely
hit
on
my
weakness
the
result
was
that
mathematics
was
no
longer
to
me
i
found
it
had
been
a
closed
book
because
i
had
never
been
interested
enough
to
open
it
i
soon
outstripped
the
kids
in
my
class
and
was
put
in
a
higher
one
i
had
to
read
frequent
chapters
of
alice
in
wonderland
to
cheer
me
on
and
miss
cox
used
to
quote
lewis
carroll
to
me
when
she
and
i
were
alone
i
found
the
other
girls
in
the
classes
looked
upon
her
as
nothing
but
a
teacher
and
she
regarded
them
as
mere
pupils
to
be
taught
conscientiously
and
then
dismissed
one
day
i
sailed
safely
through
a
problem
that
was
noted
as
a
regular
stumper
as
soon
as
the
class
was
dismissed
miss
cox
exclaimed
to
my
arms
my
beamish
boy
you
slain
the
jabberwock
page
i
really
believe
you
are
going
to
end
by
being
a
pretty
good
mathematician
i
answered
thought
he
saw
a
garden
door
that
opened
with
a
key
he
looked
again
and
found
it
was
a
double
rule
of
three
all
its
mystery
he
said
clear
as
day
to
me
if
i
ever
understand
it
it
will
be
thanks
to
you
and
lewis
carroll
the
tuckers
had
been
to
school
pretty
steadily
all
their
lives
so
they
were
able
to
go
into
the
sophomore
class
in
everything
i
bitterly
regretted
that
my
education
had
been
so
erratic
but
determined
to
make
the
best
of
it
dum
helped
me
with
my
french
and
we
tried
to
keep
to
our
rule
of
talking
french
at
the
table
but
as
we
did
what
mammy
susan
called
our
own
retching
and
my
vocabulary
was
somewhat
limited
we
had
to
resort
to
english
a
great
deal
or
go
unfed
i
know
dum
and
dee
felt
sorry
for
me
for
being
in
a
kids
class
in
mathematics
i
did
really
mind
nearly
so
much
as
they
thought
i
did
the
kids
were
nice
to
me
and
i
made
some
mighty
good
friends
among
them
there
was
one
little
bunchy
girl
named
mary
flannigan
who
turned
out
in
the
end
one
of
the
best
friends
i
ever
had
in
my
life
she
was
short
and
stumpy
with
scrambled
red
hair
and
a
freckled
face
and
the
very
keenest
sense
of
humor
i
had
ever
known
she
was
a
year
younger
than
i
was
but
very
well
up
in
her
classes
and
she
had
a
genius
for
mimicry
that
was
irresistibly
funny
she
had
some
stunts
that
endeared
her
to
all
the
girls
she
could
do
a
dog
fight
or
cats
on
the
back
fence
and
could
go
so
like
a
mosquito
that
you
were
certain
you
would
be
bitten
in
a
moment
she
was
something
of
a
ventriloquist
which
made
these
accomplishments
especially
delightful
mary
and
i
were
put
into
algebra
at
the
same
time
and
to
our
joy
miss
cox
was
to
teach
us
mary
had
found
out
miss
cox
too
tweedles
and
i
had
religiously
refrained
from
telling
any
of
the
girls
about
her
mad
revel
on
the
day
of
our
arrival
but
we
had
tried
to
make
them
understand
what
a
very
good
old
girl
she
was
if
you
could
just
find
her
out
and
our
attitude
toward
her
was
having
its
effect
on
the
whole
school
miss
cox
realizing
that
she
was
really
liked
and
understood
had
a
change
of
expression
as
well
as
heart
her
sad
crooked
face
was
now
a
happy
crooked
face
and
she
no
longer
saved
her
jokes
for
tweedles
and
me
but
got
them
off
indiscriminately
and
very
good
jokes
they
were
too
the
classes
in
voice
culture
became
more
popular
and
more
and
more
girls
wrote
home
begging
to
be
allowed
to
take
singing
i
shall
never
forget
mary
and
my
first
lesson
in
algebra
miss
cox
looked
at
us
with
her
twisted
smile
algebra
is
rather
a
name
do
you
think
she
asked
us
maybe
it
is
said
mary
but
i
bet
it
takes
it
out
in
sounding
so
oh
i
do
know
about
that
and
miss
cox
opened
the
book
at
the
first
page
and
read
as
follows
algebra
the
operations
of
arithmetic
are
abridged
and
generalized
by
means
of
symbols
that
appeals
to
the
imagination
somewhat
i
think
which
represent
numbers
just
that
word
sets
me
to
dreaming
arithmetic
is
the
prose
of
mathematics
where
everything
is
stated
and
nothing
left
to
the
imagination
but
algebra
is
very
different
numbers
are
usually
represented
by
the
first
letters
of
the
alphabet
as
a
b
unknown
numbers
or
those
whose
values
are
to
be
determined
are
usually
represented
by
the
last
letters
of
the
alphabet
as
x
y
z
the
unknown
numbers
the
mysterious
numbers
for
what
is
unknown
is
in
a
measure
mysterious
and
what
is
mysterious
is
romantic
or
poetic
that
is
the
way
i
think
of
it
in
working
your
algebra
do
just
look
at
it
as
hard
dry
facts
to
be
mastered
but
let
x
y
z
be
the
great
unknown
that
you
are
to
find
let
the
problem
be
a
plot
that
you
are
to
unravel
as
poe
did
gold
bug
you
may
well
imagine
that
mary
and
i
set
to
with
a
will
to
get
all
we
could
out
of
such
a
thrilling
subject
there
were
times
when
we
felt
that
miss
cox
was
drawing
a
little
on
her
imagination
to
find
poetry
in
such
an
example
as
this
for
instance
on
the
whole
though
algebra
was
much
more
interesting
than
arithmetic
and
sometimes
i
had
the
realization
that
it
did
mean
a
lot
to
me
and
mary
said
she
felt
the
same
way
anyhow
in
the
early
spring
we
were
able
to
take
the
sophomore
tests
and
go
on
in
that
class
miss
peyton
said
she
considered
it
really
wonderful
that
i
should
have
progressed
so
rapidly
but
i
told
her
it
was
all
due
to
miss
cox
being
so
certain
that
lewis
carroll
and
i
had
similar
brains
chapter
ix
football
none
of
our
crowd
had
reached
what
the
call
the
boy
age
we
had
our
heroes
of
romance
that
it
was
difficult
for
any
of
the
male
persuasion
in
real
life
to
live
up
to
tweedles
declared
that
zebedee
was
boy
enough
for
them
although
dum
thought
if
she
ever
met
a
prosper
le
gai
she
might
consider
him
while
dee
had
an
idea
a
boy
like
laurie
in
little
women
would
be
some
sport
and
she
might
be
willing
to
knock
around
with
him
a
bit
jane
eyre
rochester
was
my
beau
ideal
i
want
a
dark
masterful
lover
who
could
tie
the
poker
up
in
a
bowknot
if
he
had
a
mind
to
a
rude
man
who
could
bring
tears
to
my
eyes
by
his
gruffness
and
then
with
the
gentleness
of
a
woman
soothe
my
aching
head
oh
page
chimed
in
annie
pore
how
could
you
want
such
a
ruffian
i
like
henry
esmond
so
kind
and
courteous
and
dignified
yes
and
as
stiff
as
a
poker
my
rochester
could
tie
him
up
in
a
bowknot
in
no
time
and
soothe
your
aching
head
with
him
too
i
fancy
i
think
a
man
who
is
rude
enough
to
make
a
woman
cry
and
strong
enough
to
tie
up
pokers
would
be
more
than
likely
to
beat
his
wife
with
said
poker
this
from
mary
flannigan
who
was
in
our
room
during
the
discussion
of
our
favorite
heroes
i
want
or
nothing
give
me
a
man
who
is
gay
and
rollicking
at
the
same
time
and
kindly
if
quick
to
fight
withal
we
had
to
laugh
at
mary
she
was
such
a
little
mother
bunch
with
her
crinkly
red
hair
bushing
out
around
her
fat
freckled
face
hardly
a
likely
person
to
attract
a
hero
of
romance
mary
wore
as
many
petticoats
as
mammy
susan
and
all
of
them
were
tied
around
her
waist
with
draw
strings
i
verily
believe
that
she
and
mammy
susan
were
the
only
persons
left
in
the
world
who
wore
red
flannel
petticoats
in
that
day
and
generation
when
slimiky
skirts
were
the
rage
you
can
fancy
how
mary
looked
with
her
gathered
skirts
she
also
had
a
leaning
toward
deep
ruffles
around
her
neck
which
more
than
ever
gave
her
the
look
of
a
clown
dog
she
had
a
way
of
breaking
into
the
conversation
very
much
as
the
clown
dog
breaks
into
the
ring
and
no
matter
how
serious
she
was
we
simply
had
to
laugh
at
her
she
was
very
and
not
the
least
bit
touchy
we
laughed
at
her
general
bunchiness
just
because
we
help
it
but
one
and
all
liked
her
for
her
good
temper
and
ready
wit
and
respected
her
for
her
excellent
standing
in
her
classes
where
she
was
the
youngest
pupil
we
also
envied
her
the
delightful
stunts
that
i
believe
i
have
mentioned
before
i
rather
be
able
to
go
like
a
dog
the
way
mary
can
than
make
the
finest
statue
of
one
that
ever
was
done
sighed
dum
nonsense
dum
anybody
can
go
like
a
dog
with
a
little
practice
but
to
make
one
in
clay
is
going
some
but
to
return
to
our
lovers
what
do
you
girls
say
to
taking
in
the
football
game
over
at
the
seniors
are
going
one
and
all
and
miss
peyton
says
any
of
us
can
go
who
wish
miss
cox
will
chaperon
the
sophomores
was
a
boys
school
on
the
other
side
of
the
village
from
gresham
academy
and
young
ladies
from
our
school
were
always
invited
to
the
match
games
there
and
our
school
in
turn
sent
a
formal
invitation
to
the
pupils
of
when
an
interesting
basketball
game
was
to
be
played
at
gresham
oh
do
come
all
of
you
i
never
seen
a
game
of
football
in
my
life
and
i
just
wild
to
i
begged
i
guess
i
wo
go
said
annie
well
i
think
you
got
another
guess
coming
unless
you
have
a
powerful
good
reason
i
exclaimed
my
only
reason
is
that
i
am
so
embarrassed
with
boys
and
poor
annie
gave
her
usual
painful
blush
oh
you
wo
have
to
speak
to
the
boys
they
never
notice
the
sophs
anyhow
but
give
all
their
twaddle
to
the
juniors
and
seniors
if
a
boy
old
enough
to
walk
breaks
through
mabel
binks
guard
he
is
a
hero
for
fair
laughed
dee
so
annie
objections
overcome
we
hurried
her
and
mary
off
to
put
on
their
hats
and
wraps
and
quickly
donning
our
own
got
downstairs
just
in
time
to
form
in
line
with
the
sophomores
who
were
starting
under
the
leadership
of
miss
cox
for
the
game
at
i
glad
to
see
you
are
going
page
said
margaret
sayre
as
she
hooked
her
arm
in
mine
i
am
to
help
miss
cox
keep
order
although
i
do
really
think
i
am
needed
sophomores
are
never
boy
crazy
the
juniors
are
the
ones
as
a
rule
that
need
quieting
sometimes
i
wonder
where
all
the
bad
juniors
go
to
and
where
all
the
good
seniors
come
from
well
i
reckon
the
bad
juniors
were
once
good
sophomores
and
they
can
just
as
easily
turn
into
good
seniors
i
responded
the
juniors
at
gresham
were
a
rather
wild
lot
and
they
had
as
a
leader
mabel
binks
who
although
she
was
a
senior
chose
her
friends
entirely
among
the
juniors
the
truth
of
the
matter
was
as
mammy
susan
used
to
say
mabel
would
rather
be
a
king
among
buzzards
than
a
buzzard
among
kings
the
seniors
would
have
none
of
her
leadership
and
among
them
she
had
to
take
a
back
seat
while
the
juniors
welcomed
her
to
their
ranks
with
joy
not
realizing
why
she
had
chosen
them
and
flattered
by
her
notice
the
long
line
of
girls
two
abreast
wound
its
way
through
the
streets
of
the
little
town
and
out
into
the
country
again
to
the
boys
school
it
was
really
a
very
pretty
sight
this
row
of
blooming
happy
girls
all
ages
and
sizes
dressed
in
the
universally
becoming
dark
blue
with
their
jaunty
velvet
sailor
hats
perched
at
every
conceivable
angle
on
heads
of
hair
of
every
conceivable
color
does
annie
pore
look
pretty
in
her
new
hat
whispered
miss
sayre
these
velvet
sailors
were
ordered
by
the
school
and
every
pupil
was
obliged
to
have
one
all
of
us
were
glad
that
annie
was
forced
to
discard
her
crêpe
hat
that
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
last
year
bird
nest
the
black
velvet
sailor
was
exactly
right
for
her
throwing
into
pleasing
contrast
her
skin
and
bringing
out
the
wonderful
tints
in
her
hair
jo
barr
with
wonderful
tact
had
managed
to
change
the
hang
of
her
dragging
skirt
and
it
was
now
even
around
the
bottom
i
think
she
is
beautiful
and
she
is
really
very
fine
in
many
ways
i
have
grown
so
fond
of
her
all
of
us
have
and
i
think
dum
and
dee
are
having
a
splendid
effect
on
her
spirits
for
she
is
not
nearly
so
lugubrious
dum
and
dee
may
be
having
a
fine
effect
too
laughed
miss
sayre
but
a
girl
named
page
allison
is
doing
her
part
all
the
faculty
notice
it
i
wish
someone
like
you
could
be
in
every
class
someone
to
leaven
the
whole
lump
with
a
certain
quality
of
camaraderie
annie
pore
was
as
forlorn
a
specimen
of
humanity
as
ever
stepped
out
of
a
that
first
day
here
and
now
look
at
her
annie
was
laughing
heartily
as
mary
flannigan
made
a
noise
like
a
sick
kitten
throwing
her
voice
with
her
powers
as
a
ventriloquist
so
it
seemed
to
come
from
a
clump
of
sumac
by
the
roadside
dee
was
peering
eagerly
into
the
bushes
before
she
caught
on
to
the
joke
annie
pore
certainly
did
not
look
like
the
same
girl
no
one
would
think
of
nicknaming
her
orphan
annie
now
the
name
clung
to
her
however
among
a
certain
class
thanks
to
mabel
binks
who
had
not
been
able
to
forgive
or
forget
the
laugh
raised
against
her
by
annie
on
the
first
day
of
school
was
built
much
in
the
same
style
as
gresham
and
it
too
had
the
parthenon
effect
with
its
big
white
pillars
the
view
was
not
quite
so
fine
as
ours
but
from
the
little
experience
i
had
had
of
boys
i
imagined
they
did
not
go
in
for
views
to
any
great
extent
a
primrose
by
the
river
brink
a
common
primrose
was
to
him
and
nothing
more
for
that
matter
i
noticed
that
mighty
few
of
the
girls
at
gresham
appreciated
the
view
and
as
miss
sayre
said
thought
more
of
dessert
for
dinner
than
of
the
view
of
the
mountains
the
game
was
just
starting
as
we
arrived
so
we
seated
ourselves
on
the
benches
provided
for
the
visitors
with
as
little
stir
as
possible
dum
got
on
the
other
side
of
me
to
put
me
on
to
the
points
of
the
great
game
of
football
it
seems
too
foolish
and
backwoodsy
for
me
never
to
have
seen
a
game
i
said
but
at
milton
everyone
is
too
old
to
do
more
than
walk
through
a
set
of
croquet
or
too
young
to
do
more
than
bounce
a
rubber
ball
father
occasionally
threatens
to
go
up
to
richmond
for
the
game
at
thanksgiving
but
somebody
is
always
coming
or
going
i
mean
getting
born
or
dying
and
we
have
never
made
it
yet
never
mind
honey
and
dum
gave
me
a
hug
you
learn
all
the
points
of
the
game
and
some
time
when
we
are
back
in
richmond
zebedee
will
give
us
a
great
football
party
we
always
go
to
the
thanksgiving
game
i
do
see
what
zebedee
will
do
without
us
this
year
who
that
pa
of
yours
said
mabel
binks
who
was
seated
right
in
front
of
us
with
the
juniors
as
usual
why
i
wager
he
can
find
someone
to
take
your
place
i
bet
he
having
a
pretty
good
time
with
you
kids
off
his
hands
dum
hands
clinched
and
unclinched
her
eyes
were
closed
and
her
lips
moving
i
had
not
lived
with
the
tucker
twins
for
several
weeks
without
finding
out
what
that
meant
when
dum
did
that
way
it
meant
she
was
trying
to
control
her
temper
her
lips
formed
these
words
oh
god
make
me
good
do
let
me
biff
mabel
binks
do
let
me
biff
mabel
binks
for
a
moment
the
wicked
wish
came
into
my
heart
that
she
would
biff
mabel
binks
but
when
i
thought
of
the
consternation
it
would
arouse
in
gresham
and
the
disgrace
to
our
class
to
say
nothing
of
poor
dum
i
felt
ashamed
of
myself
for
harboring
such
a
militant
desire
i
slipped
my
hand
over
dum
clenched
fist
and
in
a
moment
i
felt
it
relax
thank
you
page
god
answered
my
prayer
quicker
than
usual
thanks
to
you
and
dum
gave
a
great
sigh
of
relief
it
seemed
to
me
almost
like
it
would
be
wrong
if
i
did
hit
her
zebedee
would
fight
for
us
any
day
and
i
do
see
why
i
ca
fight
for
him
well
when
you
come
down
to
facts
dum
mabel
binks
did
not
say
anything
derogatory
of
your
father
she
said
he
was
and
intimated
that
he
was
naturally
popular
i
fancy
she
would
like
to
go
to
the
thanksgiving
game
herself
with
him
there
is
nothing
for
you
to
fight
about
i
have
an
idea
that
tucker
can
take
care
of
himself
enough
not
to
take
her
to
the
game
at
least
i
whispered
and
dum
laughed
aloud
so
that
mabel
turned
around
and
asked
what
the
joke
and
dum
had
the
satisfaction
of
saying
in
honeyed
tones
one
of
the
kid
jokes
that
i
fancy
you
would
not
appreciate
the
game
of
football
at
first
impressed
me
as
little
more
than
a
tangle
of
legs
and
a
dog
fight
at
bracken
had
more
sense
to
it
but
as
dum
explained
the
points
i
began
to
see
some
method
in
the
seeming
madness
of
boys
lying
down
on
one
poor
ball
and
yelling
needless
to
add
i
very
soon
became
as
enthusiastic
about
that
game
as
all
other
games
i
ever
had
any
knowledge
of
and
before
the
football
season
was
over
i
was
as
rabid
a
rooter
as
the
tuckers
themselves
i
believe
you
are
a
born
lover
of
games
page
said
miss
sayre
smiling
as
my
enthusiasm
got
the
better
of
me
and
i
let
out
a
piercing
shriek
in
honor
of
a
short
boy
who
had
seized
the
ball
at
a
crucial
moment
and
literally
dodged
his
way
through
the
seniors
and
made
a
goal
the
game
was
between
the
seniors
and
sophomores
and
of
course
the
sophomores
of
gresham
were
in
honor
bound
to
root
for
the
sophomores
of
who
all
right
who
all
right
shorty
shorty
out
of
sight
yelled
the
class
for
their
hero
and
then
the
seniors
gave
him
fifteen
seniors
always
have
a
special
feeling
for
sophomores
and
a
game
between
them
is
usually
a
very
friendly
bout
of
course
the
seniors
do
not
exactly
want
to
be
beaten
but
they
take
a
great
delight
in
the
prowess
of
their
pet
class
in
spite
of
shorty
good
playing
and
a
great
deal
of
good
playing
from
the
other
ten
sophomores
the
seniors
won
which
was
quite
meet
and
proper
the
younger
boys
had
put
up
a
good
fight
and
were
much
applauded
by
their
elders
chapter
x
boys
after
the
football
game
some
of
the
more
boys
came
over
to
the
visitors
from
gresham
and
singled
out
their
friends
to
conduct
them
to
the
tables
on
the
lawn
where
the
matron
was
serving
ice
cream
all
the
boys
spoke
to
miss
cox
and
seemed
on
the
most
friendly
terms
with
her
i
remembered
then
that
she
went
over
to
twice
a
week
for
the
purpose
of
training
a
chorus
she
knew
them
all
by
name
and
chatted
with
them
very
freely
much
more
freely
than
she
did
with
any
of
the
girls
except
dum
and
dee
and
me
evidently
miss
cox
understands
boys
better
than
she
does
girls
and
they
understand
her
thought
i
her
manner
with
them
was
frank
and
natural
exactly
as
it
had
been
with
tucker
a
tall
boy
was
holding
a
laughing
conversation
with
her
about
the
game
he
it
was
who
had
saved
the
day
for
the
seniors
when
it
had
looked
as
though
the
younger
class
would
certainly
win
owing
to
the
strategic
movements
of
the
popular
shorty
did
the
kid
make
a
fine
play
though
miss
cox
it
seemed
a
pity
to
take
the
game
from
them
but
i
tell
you
if
the
sophomores
won
from
the
seniors
there
would
be
no
living
with
them
they
rather
a
cocky
lot
as
it
is
bless
yes
they
are
fine
boys
and
i
wish
they
might
have
won
just
this
once
they
worked
so
hard
and
you
seniors
were
playing
so
lazily
you
almost
let
the
game
slip
through
your
fingers
it
would
have
been
a
good
lesson
for
your
team
if
they
had
lost
that
just
what
i
tell
them
miss
cox
i
hate
lazy
playing
even
if
you
are
up
against
something
easy
i
believe
in
playing
the
game
to
the
best
of
your
ability
if
it
nothing
but
i
certainly
liked
the
way
that
boy
talked
and
agreed
with
him
i
unconsciously
drew
nearer
to
where
he
and
miss
cox
were
standing
not
with
any
idea
of
being
introduced
but
because
i
was
interested
in
what
they
were
saying
no
you
do
miss
buttinsky
was
whispered
in
my
ear
seniors
first
when
there
is
a
good
thing
in
sight
and
mabel
binks
crowded
in
front
of
me
and
deliberately
joined
the
group
around
miss
cox
an
introduction
to
the
handsome
football
player
naturally
followed
i
drew
back
abashed
one
of
the
most
hateful
things
about
mabel
binks
was
that
she
usually
attributed
her
motives
to
other
persons
she
was
determined
to
meet
this
boy
and
she
took
for
granted
it
was
what
i
was
after
too
i
felt
like
employing
dum
method
and
praying
not
to
biff
mabel
binks
but
i
was
anxious
to
see
what
the
outcome
would
be
and
if
the
handsome
youth
whose
name
i
had
learned
was
harvie
price
would
be
attracted
by
the
charms
of
the
stylish
mabel
mabel
was
not
a
girl
rather
handsome
in
fact
but
a
trifle
too
vivid
for
my
taste
her
eyes
were
as
black
and
shiny
as
new
shoes
her
abundant
hair
coarse
and
curly
her
lips
too
full
and
red
her
figure
handsome
but
rather
too
well
developed
for
a
girl
of
seventeen
she
was
always
richly
dressed
and
in
the
latest
style
the
idea
of
the
directors
of
gresham
in
having
the
pupils
dress
in
blue
suits
and
black
hats
was
to
do
away
with
the
custom
of
overdressing
common
to
many
boarding
schools
they
seemed
to
think
that
a
blue
suit
was
a
blue
suit
they
were
vastly
mistaken
however
as
anyone
with
half
an
eye
could
see
by
comparing
mabel
binks
with
annie
pore
annie
appearance
i
have
described
mabel
suit
was
a
costly
affair
of
handsome
cloth
combined
with
velvet
and
trimmed
with
fur
the
skirt
was
slit
showing
a
cerise
petticoat
a
cerise
crêpe
de
chine
tie
gave
color
to
her
very
blouse
and
around
her
velvet
sailor
she
had
pinned
several
large
fine
ostrich
plumes
the
latest
style
of
pumps
with
cut
steel
buckles
were
on
her
feet
making
them
a
little
too
prominent
considering
their
size
and
shape
spotless
white
gloves
finished
her
costume
unless
one
might
consider
the
strong
odor
of
musk
perfume
the
finishing
touch
she
did
look
handsome
and
her
clothes
were
pretty
and
fine
but
a
little
too
fine
for
a
football
match
oh
price
she
gushed
your
playing
was
just
grand
all
of
us
were
just
wild
about
it
i
said
not
you
understand
and
she
giggled
affectedly
i
think
it
was
real
noble
of
you
to
let
the
kids
get
any
points
at
all
yes
mighty
noble
said
harvie
price
looking
at
his
dashing
admirer
rather
quizzically
so
noble
they
came
mighty
near
winning
the
whole
shooting
match
is
that
ice
cream
they
are
serving
over
there
she
hinted
i
think
ice
cream
is
simply
grand
ah
miss
binks
you
praise
my
feeble
game
and
ice
cream
with
the
same
words
fortunately
ice
cream
is
more
easily
taken
in
than
i
am
hey
you
shorty
come
here
he
called
to
the
little
sophomore
who
was
trotting
by
i
want
to
introduce
you
to
miss
binks
thomas
hawkins
miss
binks
shorty
she
dying
for
some
ice
cream
your
humble
servitor
madam
and
thomas
hawkins
made
a
low
bow
shall
i
bring
it
to
you
or
take
you
to
it
bring
it
here
said
mabel
shortly
just
then
harvie
price
saw
annie
pore
talking
to
mary
flannigan
and
dee
tell
me
who
that
girl
is
over
there
the
one
with
the
thick
yellow
plait
he
asked
mabel
oh
that
annie
is
she
a
mess
is
her
name
annie
pore
i
believe
it
is
or
poor
annie
if
you
prefer
well
by
jove
who
would
have
thought
it
and
harvie
price
without
any
apology
left
the
dashing
mabel
and
going
up
to
annie
took
her
by
both
hands
he
shook
them
warmly
and
exclaimed
little
annie
pore
where
on
earth
did
you
come
from
i
am
glad
to
see
you
and
annie
without
the
least
embarrassment
was
equally
delighted
to
see
him
oh
harvie
i
did
not
dream
you
were
here
you
grown
so
i
know
you
grown
and
what
have
you
been
doing
certainly
not
standing
still
and
how
is
everyone
at
the
landing
geewhilikins
i
like
to
spend
another
summer
there
just
think
it
is
five
years
since
i
have
been
there
everything
is
about
the
same
your
grandfather
is
rather
more
feeble
but
as
handsome
as
ever
yes
i
know
poor
old
grandad
said
harvie
soberly
annie
told
me
afterward
that
a
family
row
had
separated
old
general
price
from
his
son
harvie
father
and
for
that
reason
the
boy
had
not
been
allowed
to
come
to
his
ancestral
home
at
price
landing
and
how
is
your
father
as
british
as
ever
and
still
invisibly
clothed
in
blue
paint
yes
about
the
same
blushed
annie
you
know
i
like
your
father
annie
and
did
mean
anything
and
the
boy
looked
very
sorry
that
he
had
embarrassed
his
little
friend
that
all
right
harvie
but
you
know
yes
i
know
he
said
sympathetically
now
come
on
and
let
have
some
ice
cream
who
are
your
special
friends
introduce
me
and
i
take
them
all
dum
and
dee
and
mary
flannigan
and
i
were
of
course
the
chosen
few
and
as
soon
as
shorty
had
arranged
so
mabel
binks
could
take
in
the
ice
cream
he
joined
us
and
a
very
merry
time
we
had
we
met
many
boys
and
liked
most
of
them
they
were
a
healthy
wholesome
lot
and
almost
as
much
fun
as
girls
miss
cox
joined
us
and
let
herself
go
with
as
much
abandon
as
she
had
in
the
lobster
quadrille
i
have
never
seen
anyone
so
happy
as
annie
pore
she
and
harvie
price
had
been
friends
from
the
time
they
could
walk
the
boy
had
spent
a
great
deal
of
his
time
with
his
grandfather
at
price
landing
and
the
little
english
maid
whose
father
kept
the
country
store
was
the
one
white
child
in
the
neighborhood
whom
the
proud
old
aristocratic
general
price
considered
suitable
to
associate
with
his
grandson
you
ought
to
see
mr
pore
harvie
confided
to
me
i
tell
you
he
is
a
rare
one
he
is
about
the
best
educated
man
i
ever
met
grandad
says
he
can
think
in
latin
be
that
as
it
may
he
can
certainly
teach
it
i
had
some
lessons
from
him
during
one
summer
and
have
been
grateful
to
him
ever
since
he
is
awfully
english
and
just
as
strict
with
annie
as
can
be
mrs
pore
was
a
beautiful
woman
and
it
seemed
strangely
incongruous
to
see
her
in
the
country
store
measuring
calico
and
what
not
grandad
used
to
say
she
looked
like
a
duchess
at
a
charity
bazaar
nobody
at
price
landing
ever
has
known
what
brought
mr
pore
to
keeping
a
country
store
in
a
little
virginia
village
maybe
thinking
in
latin
was
nourishing
i
suggested
i
fancy
that
was
it
he
laughed
but
why
should
an
oxford
graduate
keep
a
country
store
for
a
livelihood
there
must
have
been
other
avenues
open
to
him
perhaps
his
beautiful
wife
discovered
she
had
a
genius
for
selling
at
charity
bazaars
and
when
the
time
came
to
choose
a
profession
she
chose
what
she
had
shown
talent
for
as
an
amateur
i
hazarded
well
i
see
miss
page
allison
has
some
imagination
and
if
she
ever
has
to
choose
a
profession
it
should
be
novel
writing
perhaps
it
will
be
i
said
but
i
rather
keep
a
country
store
than
do
anything
you
can
see
so
many
people
that
way
if
you
have
the
postoffice
in
it
you
like
people
then
inquired
the
boy
like
people
i
should
say
i
do
i
just
adore
people
and
i
mean
to
know
just
as
many
people
as
i
can
well
that
is
the
requisite
for
successful
novel
writing
so
our
professor
in
english
tells
us
people
and
sympathize
with
them
all
kinds
and
conditions
but
tell
me
something
miss
page
does
annie
sing
mrs
pore
voice
brought
old
sinners
to
church
that
had
not
been
for
many
a
year
she
sang
in
the
choir
at
the
little
old
episcopal
church
at
price
landing
and
although
i
was
nothing
but
a
kid
you
see
i
have
not
been
there
for
five
years
i
used
to
thrill
all
over
when
she
chanted
the
deum
oh
yes
annie
voice
is
splendid
miss
cox
is
teaching
her
and
i
believe
she
expects
great
things
of
her
we
are
to
have
a
concert
at
gresham
before
long
and
then
you
can
hear
her
i
looked
over
at
a
group
of
girls
and
boys
where
dum
and
annie
were
talking
very
gayly
with
tom
hawkins
alias
shorty
and
smiled
to
think
of
annie
hesitancy
in
coming
that
day
because
she
was
so
afraid
of
boys
and
then
i
laughed
outright
when
i
considered
how
little
shorty
resembled
dum
hero
prosper
le
gai
the
ice
cream
that
shorty
brought
to
mabel
binks
must
have
been
as
bitter
as
gall
judging
from
the
faces
that
young
lady
made
while
devouring
it
nor
did
it
set
easy
on
her
innards
as
mammy
susan
would
put
it
could
it
be
that
she
had
literally
turned
green
from
jealousy
and
the
ice
cream
was
innocent
after
all
it
must
have
been
a
bitter
pill
to
have
the
despised
orphan
annie
with
her
kid
friends
carry
off
the
most
desirable
young
man
at
are
you
feeling
well
mabel
said
the
josephine
barr
as
harvie
price
and
i
passed
near
her
on
our
way
to
join
the
group
where
my
special
friends
were
yes
i
just
disgusted
did
you
ever
see
such
a
beau
grabber
in
your
life
as
that
countrified
page
allison
and
there
actually
posing
as
a
belle
they
make
me
sick
i
did
not
hear
what
jo
answered
but
i
felt
that
annie
and
i
were
safe
in
her
hands
my
cheeks
were
burning
as
though
mabel
had
given
me
a
real
slap
do
you
mind
miss
page
if
girls
only
knew
how
fellows
detest
that
kind
of
thing
it
must
be
awful
to
be
a
girl
and
not
fight
things
out
if
a
boy
had
insulted
me
as
that
girl
did
you
just
now
i
either
beat
him
or
get
beaten
in
short
order
well
i
said
pulling
myself
together
as
i
realized
that
after
all
mabel
binks
was
not
much
of
a
lady
you
see
i
have
already
beaten
her
although
i
did
not
know
at
the
time
i
was
doing
it
annie
and
i
have
got
the
that
is
if
she
means
you
and
shorty
bully
for
you
that
the
way
to
talk
i
see
miss
binks
will
not
pull
off
anything
over
you
can
annie
defend
herself
too
so
i
told
him
of
the
first
day
at
gresham
and
the
cheer
the
seniors
gave
annie
because
of
her
at
mabel
binks
poor
little
annie
i
do
see
how
anyone
could
try
to
hurt
her
and
the
big
boy
looked
very
tenderly
at
his
playmate
i
am
certainly
glad
she
has
found
such
good
friends
at
gresham
as
you
and
those
wonderful
twins
and
also
that
nice
little
square
irish
girl
who
looks
like
a
match
for
our
shorty
that
night
before
lights
out
bell
rang
we
had
a
little
chat
in
our
room
mary
and
annie
had
scurried
across
the
hall
in
their
kimonos
dum
was
in
bed
and
dee
and
i
had
unearthed
some
slight
refreshment
in
the
way
of
crackers
and
sweet
chocolate
which
we
passed
around
i
bet
prosper
le
gai
would
have
played
a
dandy
game
of
football
said
dum
getting
her
sheets
all
crumby
with
crackers
he
always
smiled
in
battle
i
noticed
harvie
price
did
too
do
you
know
i
think
harvie
price
looked
a
little
like
laurie
in
women
said
dee
i
always
did
think
so
exclaimed
annie
when
you
were
talking
about
laurie
this
morning
i
thought
of
harvie
i
never
dreamed
of
seeing
him
i
so
glad
you
girls
liked
him
i
tell
you
he
all
right
said
mary
but
i
would
be
at
all
astonished
if
charles
was
just
such
another
boy
as
shorty
when
he
was
a
kid
chapter
xi
letters
and
several
kinds
of
fathers
from
page
allison
to
miss
sue
lee
washington
my
dearest
cousin
sue
you
told
me
not
to
write
to
you
until
i
had
got
real
settled
and
could
give
you
some
decided
opinions
about
the
place
and
the
people
i
am
settled
now
and
feel
as
though
i
had
been
born
and
bred
here
i
just
love
it
and
am
making
loads
and
loads
of
friends
first
thing
i
must
tell
you
how
right
my
clothes
are
it
is
splendid
not
to
have
to
think
about
them
but
just
to
put
them
on
and
know
that
they
are
suitable
some
of
the
girls
here
are
great
dressers
in
spite
of
the
endeavors
of
the
directors
to
put
them
into
a
kind
of
uniform
but
i
ca
see
that
their
fine
clothes
make
them
any
more
popular
than
the
others
do
you
know
cousin
sue
i
rather
be
popular
than
be
president
my
roommates
the
tucker
twins
are
awfully
popular
but
they
do
care
nearly
so
much
about
it
as
i
do
you
see
they
have
been
knowing
lots
of
people
all
their
lives
and
i
have
sometimes
i
am
afraid
i
get
kind
of
in
my
anxiety
to
have
people
like
me
and
the
only
thing
that
saves
me
from
it
is
my
hatred
of
fools
and
snobs
i
know
i
should
hate
fools
because
they
ca
help
it
but
i
think
snobs
ought
to
be
hated
we
have
become
acquainted
with
some
boys
from
the
academy
on
the
other
side
of
the
town
they
are
real
nice
and
i
find
i
am
not
at
all
embarrassed
with
them
they
are
not
a
bit
beauy
or
lovery
the
tuckers
and
i
would
hate
that
but
they
are
just
boys
and
have
got
lots
more
sense
than
i
expected
to
find
in
the
male
sex
the
juniors
here
at
gresham
are
lots
of
them
beau
crazy
they
talk
about
boys
from
morning
till
night
i
do
hope
when
i
get
to
be
a
junior
i
go
through
that
stage
miss
sayre
a
lovely
girl
and
too
nice
to
me
for
anything
a
pupil
teacher
and
at
least
nineteen
says
she
has
never
known
but
one
girl
in
her
life
who
arrived
at
her
age
without
going
through
the
stage
of
talking
about
boys
all
the
time
and
she
says
that
poor
girl
was
dumb
and
she
took
it
out
in
making
eyes
dum
and
dee
and
i
told
her
we
cut
out
our
tongues
before
we
make
boys
our
sole
topic
of
conversation
and
miss
sayre
just
laughed
and
asked
us
if
we
would
gouge
out
our
eyes
too
i
am
doing
very
well
in
my
studies
and
working
awfully
hard
you
see
we
have
to
spend
a
certain
time
over
our
books
and
learn
in
spite
of
ourselves
french
is
coming
easy
to
me
and
i
believe
it
is
because
father
has
drilled
me
so
thoroughly
in
latin
i
am
getting
on
top
of
mathematics
by
the
hardest
kind
of
climbing
at
first
i
felt
as
though
i
have
to
remove
mountains
ever
to
learn
a
thing
but
now
i
realize
i
do
have
to
remove
mountains
but
just
climb
them
and
certainly
as
you
climb
you
get
an
outlook
that
you
never
dreamed
of
father
writes
very
cheerfully
but
i
am
afraid
he
is
mighty
lonesome
i
feel
very
selfish
to
be
off
here
having
such
a
good
time
when
i
know
how
hard
it
is
for
him
i
wish
you
would
write
him
a
nice
long
letter
your
letters
always
do
him
good
i
like
miss
peyton
our
principal
ever
and
ever
so
much
she
is
so
just
all
of
the
teachers
are
pretty
nice
but
i
am
not
getting
quite
as
much
from
the
english
literature
teacher
as
i
hoped
i
would
she
is
a
good
teacher
i
have
no
doubt
but
not
interesting
i
have
the
feeling
that
she
likes
what
the
textbooks
tell
her
to
and
has
no
taste
of
her
own
her
knowledge
of
poetry
for
instance
stops
with
the
age
of
tennyson
you
know
father
extravagance
and
relaxation
is
poetry
past
present
and
even
future
he
has
been
reading
poetry
to
me
since
before
i
could
talk
and
a
new
poet
is
more
interesting
to
him
than
a
new
disease
he
had
never
told
me
that
poetry
had
to
arrive
at
a
certain
age
like
veal
or
cheese
before
it
was
worthy
to
be
taken
in
and
i
brought
down
the
scorn
and
wrath
of
miss
prince
on
my
devoted
head
and
came
mighty
near
getting
enough
demerits
to
keep
me
in
bounds
a
week
because
i
asked
her
if
she
did
not
think
masefield
poem
of
the
dauber
had
more
atmosphere
of
the
deep
sea
in
it
than
the
ancient
mariner
she
looked
at
me
very
severely
through
her
visible
and
said
miss
allison
this
is
a
class
in
english
literature
and
matters
foreign
to
the
subject
are
not
to
be
discussed
i
rather
miss
the
reading
i
have
always
done
we
study
so
hard
there
is
no
time
to
read
and
the
library
is
one
of
these
donated
ones
it
has
sets
of
dickens
and
scott
in
such
fine
print
that
you
ca
keep
your
place
a
few
odd
volumes
of
thackeray
milton
and
pope
and
the
rest
of
the
shelves
are
crowded
with
books
that
some
generous
patron
evidently
has
had
no
use
for
himself
they
are
the
kind
of
books
that
father
says
are
good
enough
to
keep
the
doors
open
with
or
to
put
under
a
rocker
when
you
do
want
to
rock
there
is
a
good
encyclopedia
and
dictionary
and
our
textbooks
are
very
complete
i
believe
it
is
good
for
me
to
have
to
confine
myself
to
the
textbooks
for
a
while
but
i
shall
be
glad
to
be
at
bracken
again
and
curl
up
on
the
sofa
with
the
dogs
some
dull
old
rainy
day
and
read
as
long
as
i
can
see
some
day
i
hope
you
will
know
my
friends
i
have
told
them
all
about
you
and
they
think
you
are
splendid
the
tucker
twins
are
going
to
stay
a
few
days
at
bracken
during
the
holidays
and
i
am
to
be
with
them
for
a
in
richmond
it
will
be
a
more
agreeable
visit
than
the
time
i
spent
with
cousin
park
garnett
i
fancy
by
the
way
cousin
park
sent
me
a
present
the
other
day
you
could
never
guess
what
it
is
a
black
and
purple
crocheted
shoulder
shawl
i
real
glad
to
have
it
because
we
are
going
to
have
a
dicker
party
and
it
will
be
the
very
thing
to
contribute
you
do
know
how
much
obliged
i
am
to
you
for
the
huge
box
of
marshmallows
we
have
not
opened
it
yet
as
we
are
saving
up
for
a
grand
spread
that
dum
and
dee
and
i
are
going
to
give
dear
cousin
sue
yours
devotedly
page
jeffry
tucker
to
the
misses
virginia
and
caroline
tucker
richmond
november
my
dearest
tweedles
how
am
i
ever
to
get
through
thanksgiving
without
you
of
course
i
going
to
the
game
to
root
for
virginia
but
i
be
mighty
lonesome
i
been
invited
to
join
several
parties
but
i
believe
i
take
old
brindle
and
go
by
my
lonely
the
only
pleasure
i
take
in
thanksgiving
is
that
it
is
just
a
little
nearer
to
christmas
when
i
have
my
babies
back
with
me
for
a
delirious
three
weeks
i
miss
you
so
much
that
i
ca
remember
what
my
reason
was
for
thinking
it
best
for
you
to
go
to
boarding
school
i
must
have
had
some
good
reason
but
it
is
swallowed
up
in
misery
over
your
absence
could
it
have
been
that
you
needed
training
and
to
learn
to
control
yourselves
foolish
notion
when
you
come
home
you
can
fight
all
over
the
shop
if
you
a
mind
and
sass
your
pa
until
he
crawls
under
the
bed
with
brindle
and
get
late
to
your
meals
and
go
around
with
holes
in
your
stockings
do
anything
in
fact
that
your
fancy
dictates
all
i
ask
of
you
is
to
come
home
the
same
old
tweedles
loving
your
poor
lonesome
old
zebedee
as
much
as
ever
i
am
delighted
that
you
are
making
so
many
good
friends
there
is
nothing
in
all
the
world
like
friends
and
the
ones
made
in
early
years
are
worth
all
the
others
put
together
please
remember
me
to
miss
page
allison
and
tell
her
i
saw
her
father
the
other
day
and
he
was
looking
mighty
fit
considering
he
has
not
had
her
to
take
care
of
him
for
so
long
he
had
come
up
to
richmond
for
a
medical
convention
i
am
glad
you
are
enjoying
miss
page
so
much
i
liked
her
on
short
acquaintance
better
than
any
friend
you
have
ever
had
i
am
delighted
that
you
have
invited
her
to
spend
some
of
the
holidays
with
us
i
asked
allison
if
he
could
spare
her
to
us
for
a
few
days
and
he
said
of
course
he
could
you
girls
seem
to
have
a
mutual
admiration
society
miss
page
according
to
allison
is
as
enthusiastic
about
my
girls
as
my
girls
are
about
his
girl
i
am
intensely
gratified
that
the
three
of
you
have
kept
up
with
the
poor
scared
child
we
met
on
the
train
such
a
wholesome
trio
would
be
sure
to
be
good
for
the
timid
miserable
little
thing
you
must
ask
her
to
come
to
see
us
in
richmond
if
you
have
not
already
done
so
i
am
sending
you
a
box
of
goodies
for
your
spread
i
am
afraid
some
of
the
things
are
contraband
but
people
who
make
rules
would
not
make
them
unless
they
expected
schoolgirls
and
their
outrageous
young
fathers
to
break
them
i
fancy
i
have
concealed
the
true
nature
of
the
contents
of
the
box
and
unless
the
supervision
is
very
thorough
it
will
pass
muster
and
the
contraband
articles
find
the
way
to
their
destination
your
little
insides
love
to
jinny
cox
zebedee

bracken
sunday
aft
my
dear
little
daughter
i
saw
young
jeffry
tucker
in
richmond
last
week
and
what
he
had
to
tell
me
of
my
girl
gratified
me
greatly
i
am
not
going
to
divulge
to
you
what
he
said
but
you
may
know
it
was
something
pretty
nice
i
miss
you
very
much
my
dear
page
but
poor
old
mammy
susan
is
worse
off
than
i
am
because
she
is
at
home
all
the
time
and
i
am
off
on
my
rounds
and
when
i
am
at
home
thank
god
i
have
books
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
books
take
the
place
of
my
girl
but
i
mean
i
can
bury
myself
in
them
and
for
the
time
being
be
oblivious
to
everything
else
sally
winn
is
still
trying
to
die
poor
woman
i
was
called
out
in
the
wee
small
hours
this
morning
to
help
her
cross
the
styx
she
has
been
more
determined
than
ever
since
purdy
passed
over
she
is
very
jealous
and
said
this
morning
betty
purdy
always
was
a
pushing
thing
she
made
out
all
the
time
she
did
want
to
go
but
that
not
so
i
know
she
been
getting
ahead
of
me
all
her
life
pretended
she
married
purdy
because
he
was
so
bent
on
it
that
she
had
to
everybody
knows
it
was
just
the
other
way
she
was
so
bent
on
it
purdy
had
to
of
course
you
must
have
heard
that
purdy
courted
sally
first
i
suggested
that
it
would
be
well
if
she
tried
to
live
and
perhaps
she
might
console
the
widower
and
do
you
know
i
left
her
with
a
much
stronger
pulse
i
hope
your
thanksgiving
will
go
off
finely
i
can
not
tell
you
how
we
long
for
you
my
dear
but
christmas
will
soon
be
here
and
in
the
meantime
i
am
going
to
bury
myself
in
a
new
book
i
got
in
richmond
last
week
i
am
so
glad
for
you
to
make
these
good
friends
you
write
of
the
twins
sound
delightful
tucker
is
one
of
the
best
fellows
i
know
he
is
ridiculously
young
to
be
the
father
of
girls
as
old
as
you
he
is
one
of
the
cleverest
newspaper
men
in
the
south
so
clever
i
wonder
the
south
keeps
him
new
york
newspapers
seem
to
suck
in
all
the
bright
men
sooner
or
later
i
am
so
glad
your
friends
will
come
to
bracken
for
a
visit
with
you
during
the
holidays
and
i
will
of
course
let
you
go
to
them
for
a
visit
i
may
run
up
to
the
city
at
the
same
time
cousin
park
garnett
has
made
me
promise
to
stay
with
her
the
first
time
i
go
to
richmond
so
i
am
afraid
the
trip
will
not
be
altogether
hilarious
for
me
the
dogs
send
love
to
their
mistress
in
yaps
yowls
and
whines
mammy
says
she
hopes
you
done

de
meat
you
in
dem
tubs
with
much
love
father
from

to
miss

pore
price
landing
my
dear
annie
i
am
most
gratified
at
the
account
you
give
of
the
progress
you
are
making
in
your
studies
the
authenticity
of
your
account
is
verified
by
the
report
i
have
received
from
the
principal
of
the
institution
i
am
surprised
and
grieved
that
you
should
find
your
wardrobe
not
sufficient
for
your
needs
there
is
a
vulgar
tendency
among
all
americans
to
overdress
which
you
must
avoid
remember
that
in
your
veins
flows
the
blood
of
ponsonby
and
de
vere
and
that
is
more
to
be
considered
than
all
the
fine
clothes
in
the
world
of
the
i
will
send
you
the
box
containing
some
old
lace
and
a
white
dress
of
your
mother
if
that
is
not
suitable
i
think
you
had
better
not
appear
at
the
concert
of
which
you
write
i
also
wish
to
warn
you
against
undue
intimacies
with
persons
of
whom
you
know
little
or
nothing
the
sacrifice
i
am
making
in
sending
you
to
boarding
school
is
not
that
you
may
amuse
yourself
with
friends
no
doubt
beneath
you
in
birth
and
breeding
but
that
you
may
perfect
yourself
in
your
studies
and
cultivate
your
voice
which
may
prove
of
material
benefit
to
you
general
price
called
on
me
yesterday
and
told
me
he
had
received
a
letter
from
his
grandson
harvie
in
which
he
had
mentioned
the
fact
that
he
had
met
you
at
a
football
game
i
hope
you
are
not
wasting
much
of
your
time
in
such
frivolous
pursuits
yours

chapter
xii
annie
mother
we
were
rather
troubled
about
annie
pore
and
what
on
earth
she
was
going
to
wear
to
the
concert
her
wardrobe
not
being
extensive
was
well
known
to
all
of
her
friends
and
certainly
there
was
nothing
suitable
in
it
for
a
girl
who
was
going
to
have
to
stand
up
on
the
stage
and
sing
if
she
would
only
not
be
so
proud
groaned
dum
but
who
could
say
to
lady
clara
vere
de
vere
me
lend
you
some
of
my
duds
now
i
should
in
the
least
mind
borrowing
anything
from
anybody
if
i
thought
the
person
cared
for
me
do
i
wear
the
liberty
scarf
your
cousin
sue
sent
you
every
time
i
find
it
idle
and
if
i
could
borrow
from
you
page
why
should
annie
well
it
is
different
dum
because
annie
has
got
anything
you
borrow
the
scarf
just
as
a
frill
but
if
it
were
a
necessity
i
believe
you
would
i
had
intense
sympathy
for
annie
because
i
could
fancy
what
my
own
clothes
would
have
been
if
dear
cousin
sue
lee
had
not
had
them
in
charge
miss
pinky
davis
our
country
dressmaker
would
have
turned
out
just
such
another
crooked
seamed
suit
as
annie
if
cousin
sue
had
not
insisted
on
a
mail
order
and
i
know
my
shirtwaists
would
have
been
big
where
they
should
have
been
little
and
little
where
they
should
have
been
big
and
as
for
middy
blouses
there
is
no
telling
what
they
would
have
looked
like
trimming
on
the
collar
no
doubt
and
ruffles
around
the
tail
cousin
sue
did
let
miss
pinky
make
me
some
white
evening
dresses
and
they
turned
out
all
right
because
cousin
sue
bridled
miss
pinky
fancy
let
me
see
said
dee
as
far
as
i
can
remember
annie
has
a
blue
serge
skirt
two
white
shirtwaists
one
blue
poplin
one
and
a
plaid
silk
blouse
for
sunday
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
her
on
the
stage
in
any
of
that
array
of
course
it
makes
no
difference
to
any
of
us
but
think
of
that
nasty
mabel
binks
and
her
following
ugh
i
tell
you
one
thing
she
added
excitedly
if
any
of
them
make
annie
feel
bad
they
got
me
to
fight
me
too
chimed
in
dum
well
i
ca
see
that
that
would
help
annie
clothes
much
i
laughed
but
it
might
keep
you
tweedles
from
having
apoplexy
dee
you
got
so
much
tact
you
go
see
annie
and
find
out
what
she
is
going
to
wear
suggested
dum
oh
no
not
me
i
so
afraid
i
might
leak
and
that
would
never
do
and
dee
got
out
a
handkerchief
ready
for
emergencies
you
see
i
feel
so
bad
about
annie
and
so
desperately
sorry
for
her
that
i
have
to
cry
just
thinking
about
her
and
what
would
it
be
if
she
should
get
out
her
poor
little
blouses
and
ask
my
advice
just
think
of
all
the
clothes
jo
barr
has
simply
going
to
waste
and
how
old
jo
would
love
to
dress
annie
up
in
them
still
we
all
know
that
annie
would
be
cut
to
the
quick
at
the
suggestion
of
such
a
thing
oh
dear
oh
dear
i
wonder
what
zebedee
would
do
well
i
know
what
i
am
going
to
do
i
said
uncurling
myself
from
the
window
sill
where
i
could
by
a
good
deal
of
craning
of
the
neck
catch
a
glimpse
of
my
beloved
mountains
i
going
in
and
have
it
out
with
annie
she
knows
i
love
her
and
i
do
believe
i
hurt
her
feelings
i
think
she
trusts
us
and
when
you
really
trust
people
they
simply
ca
hurt
your
feelings
unless
you
have
a
natural
born
chip
on
your
shoulder
which
annie
has
oh
page
you
are
just
like
zebedee
tweedled
the
twins
that
what
he
would
do
i
found
annie
looking
very
like
old
she
was
in
a
forlorn
heap
on
the
floor
her
eyes
red
her
hair
all
disheveled
and
in
her
hand
a
crumpled
letter
on
the
floor
by
her
was
an
unopened
box
which
had
just
come
by
parcels
post
her
come
in
in
answer
to
my
knock
had
been
more
like
a
sob
than
an
invitation
to
enter
what
is
it
dear
annie
tweedles
and
i
have
just
been
talking
about
you
and
we
wonder
if
you
know
how
much
we
love
you
do
you
oh
page
i
do
see
how
you
can
well
we
do
and
i
said
i
believed
you
loved
us
enough
to
trust
us
i
mean
to
understand
that
we
could
never
hurt
your
feelings
in
any
possible
way
just
because
we
rather
be
boiled
alive
than
hurt
you
annie
looked
up
and
smiled
a
rather
watery
smile
but
a
smile
all
the
same
now
you
trust
me
and
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
what
are
friends
for
if
you
ca
tell
them
your
troubles
oh
page
i
like
to
tell
you
but
it
would
seem
so
disloyal
to
my
father
you
understand
annie
that
if
you
tell
me
anything
it
would
be
just
like
telling
it
to
a
father
confessor
i
mean
i
never
breathe
a
word
of
it
it
sounded
as
though
i
were
full
of
curiosity
but
while
of
course
i
did
want
to
know
my
reason
for
pressing
annie
was
that
i
felt
she
needed
to
let
off
steam
that
is
her
emotions
i
know
you
are
the
best
friend
any
girl
ever
had
and
i
believe
i
will
tell
you
all
about
everything
well
wash
your
face
first
and
let
me
brush
your
hair
while
you
talk
so
annie
got
up
and
bathed
her
face
and
while
i
combed
and
brushed
her
thick
yellow
hair
she
told
me
the
following
tale
you
see
page
my
father
is
an
englishman
and
he
is
awfully
proud
he
does
not
understand
a
little
girl
a
bit
nor
did
he
understand
my
beautiful
mother
he
loved
her
though
adored
her
in
fact
and
i
know
has
never
been
happy
one
minute
since
she
died
that
been
about
four
years
now
he
does
not
love
me
though
i
am
afraid
but
maybe
i
do
him
an
injustice
and
do
understand
him
anyhow
he
is
never
chummy
and
chatty
with
me
like
tucker
is
with
tweedles
i
bet
he
does
love
you
annie
my
father
is
not
so
intimate
with
me
as
tucker
is
with
his
girls
but
i
know
he
loves
me
you
see
tucker
is
almost
the
same
age
as
his
daughters
and
i
fancy
your
father
is
much
older
than
you
are
just
as
mine
is
and
i
went
on
brushing
her
hair
knowing
she
was
becoming
calmer
and
beginning
rather
to
enjoy
talking
about
herself
my
father
you
know
is
very
well
born
in
fact
his
father
was
a
baronet
of
very
ancient
stock
and
his
elder
brother
now
has
the
title
and
estates
father
was
educated
for
the
church
he
has
an
oxford
degree
and
is
very
scholarly
however
after
all
his
education
he
did
not
want
to
take
orders
he
felt
that
he
had
no
vocation
for
the
ministry
and
he
and
my
grandfather
had
an
awful
row
about
it
you
see
english
younger
sons
have
to
do
something
mother
told
me
all
this
father
has
never
mentioned
it
to
me
he
occasionally
reminds
me
that
i
am
of
good
birth
and
that
is
his
only
reference
to
england
immediately
after
this
row
with
grandfather
he
met
mother
and
fell
in
love
with
her
at
first
sight
it
was
at
a
charity
bazaar
oh
i
exclaimed
involuntarily
but
made
out
i
was
sneezing
i
remembered
the
conversation
i
had
held
with
harvie
price
about
mrs
pore
and
the
charity
bazaar
mother
people
are
noble
too
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
younger
son
of
the
earl
of
garth
but
she
had
not
a
penny
to
her
name
when
she
met
my
father
she
was
visiting
some
very
wealthy
relatives
who
were
interested
in
her
and
preparing
to
launch
her
on
the
concert
stage
mother
had
a
wonderful
voice
you
know
yes
harvie
price
told
me
that
all
the
old
sinners
in
your
county
went
to
church
to
hear
her
sing
well
mother
fell
in
love
too
and
in
spite
of
all
that
her
rich
relatives
had
to
say
about
her
career
she
married
father
and
then
what
did
grandfather
sir
isaac
pore
do
but
stop
father
allowance
it
was
not
very
much
but
it
was
enough
for
the
young
couple
to
live
on
if
they
lived
very
simply
sir
isaac
thought
he
could
force
father
into
taking
orders
but
father
was
opposed
to
doing
this
feeling
he
was
not
suited
to
the
church
and
mother
upheld
him
in
his
resolve
they
were
right
i
think
it
seems
an
awful
sin
to
me
for
a
man
just
to
go
into
the
ministry
for
a
living
i
ventured
of
course
they
were
right
then
my
parents
were
in
a
quandary
father
had
about
two
thousand
dollars
to
his
name
and
that
would
go
very
far
they
decided
to
come
to
america
he
to
go
into
some
kind
of
business
and
mother
to
do
something
with
her
voice
they
stayed
in
new
york
for
a
year
he
got
some
teaching
coaching
boys
for
college
and
she
sang
in
a
church
mother
said
they
had
a
hard
time
father
manner
was
proud
and
overbearing
and
he
was
so
intolerant
of
americans
that
he
lost
pupils
constantly
then
my
brother
was
born
and
mother
had
to
give
up
her
position
in
the
church
oh
i
did
not
know
you
had
a
brother
i
exclaimed
yes
he
died
before
i
was
born
he
lived
five
years
i
believe
i
think
that
is
one
reason
father
does
not
love
me
more
you
see
all
of
his
hopes
were
settled
on
the
boy
who
was
in
line
for
the
title
my
uncle
the
present
baronet
has
no
boys
well
they
got
on
the
best
they
could
until
the
boy
died
they
went
from
place
to
place
father
always
able
to
get
pupils
because
of
his
talents
and
education
and
always
losing
them
because
of
his
proud
intolerance
mother
had
lots
of
tact
and
charm
and
she
was
always
smoothing
things
over
and
pacifying
father
illustration
from
mother
exclaimed
the
girl
trembling
with
she
must
have
loved
him
a
whole
lot
not
to
have
pacified
him
with
a
big
stick
i
thought
but
i
did
not
give
utterance
to
my
reflection
they
finally
landed
in
norfolk
i
was
born
there
so
you
see
i
am
a
virginian
while
at
norfolk
mother
heard
of
the
country
store
at
price
landing
which
could
be
bought
for
very
little
she
had
come
into
possession
of
a
small
legacy
and
she
immediately
bought
the
store
and
all
the
stock
and
we
moved
there
and
have
been
there
ever
since
english
people
are
always
getting
small
legacies
i
never
heard
of
americans
getting
them
i
said
as
i
plaited
annie
hair
in
the
great
rope
that
was
the
envy
of
us
all
we
really
have
prospered
at
price
landing
mother
took
charge
of
the
store
a
great
deal
and
by
her
graciousness
won
customers
and
when
once
people
get
used
to
father
they
do
seem
to
mind
his
stiffness
so
much
everybody
but
me
somehow
i
always
afraid
of
him
and
annie
looked
very
sadly
at
the
crumpled
letter
in
her
lap
mother
was
so
gay
and
cheerful
i
wish
i
could
be
like
her
she
would
sing
at
her
work
and
father
would
smile
and
look
almost
happy
when
he
would
hear
her
voice
do
you
sing
at
your
work
ever
i
asked
no
no
i
am
so
afraid
of
disturbing
father
i
bet
he
like
it
why
do
you
try
your
voice
must
be
like
your
mother
oh
i
could
really
page
well
to
go
on
mother
used
to
play
a
lovely
game
with
me
and
no
one
knew
we
were
playing
it
which
made
it
just
so
much
more
fun
we
used
to
pretend
while
we
were
keeping
store
that
it
was
a
charity
bazaar
i
laughed
aloud
especially
when
dear
old
general
price
came
in
for
anything
you
see
most
of
the
people
at
price
landing
while
very
kind
and
good
are
quite
ordinary
but
general
price
is
very
aristocratic
and
fine
and
we
could
play
the
game
with
him
to
perfection
he
had
so
much
manner
that
sometimes
it
almost
seemed
that
he
was
playing
too
this
was
too
delicious
and
here
was
i
sworn
to
secrecy
i
certainly
did
want
to
tell
harvie
price
but
a
father
confessor
must
keep
many
good
things
to
himself
mother
died
when
i
was
eleven
i
made
a
rapid
calculation
how
long
poor
annie
must
have
been
wearing
the
old
crêpe
hat
since
then
father
and
i
have
looked
after
the
store
together
and
now
we
have
a
clerk
only
annie
called
it
clark
we
are
not
so
poor
as
we
used
to
be
and
the
books
show
we
are
making
a
very
comfortable
living
but
father
saves
and
saves
he
started
doing
it
before
mother
died
and
it
worried
her
a
lot
she
said
he
used
to
be
a
great
spender
and
she
had
to
do
the
saving
but
when
money
began
to
come
more
easily
he
seemed
to
hate
to
part
with
it
she
made
him
promise
before
she
died
that
i
should
go
to
boarding
school
or
i
know
it
would
never
have
come
about
of
course
he
does
know
how
girls
of
the
day
dress
and
how
odd
i
look
but
even
if
he
did
know
i
believe
he
would
let
me
be
ridiculous
rather
than
spend
money
on
anything
that
he
considered
unnecessary
annie
eyes
flashed
which
was
an
improvement
on
the
eternal
tears
she
seemed
so
prepared
to
shed
i
am
going
to
let
you
read
this
letter
from
him
so
you
can
see
and
she
handed
me
the
crumpled
sheet
it
was
the
letter
which
is
in
the
last
chapter
it
was
certainly
some
letter
i
could
not
help
comparing
it
with
the
one
i
had
just
received
from
my
father
and
also
one
that
tweedles
had
read
me
from
their
zebedee
i
hardly
knew
what
to
say
but
i
knew
what
to
think
and
that
was
that
one
of
the
vulgar
americans
ought
to
give
him
a
good
beating
well
annie
i
would
mind
that
letter
your
governor
evidently
does
understand
girls
let
have
a
look
in
the
box
we
cut
the
string
and
took
off
the
outside
wrapper
the
box
was
tightly
corded
it
is
just
as
mother
left
it
sighed
annie
he
did
even
open
it
to
see
if
the
things
in
it
were
of
any
value
for
me
i
glad
he
did
because
i
like
to
feel
that
i
am
untying
her
knots
myself
we
did
cut
those
strings
but
annie
carefully
and
reverently
picked
loose
the
knots
when
the
top
was
taken
off
the
box
there
was
a
faint
smell
of
dried
rose
leaves
the
contents
were
carefully
wrapped
in
blue
tissue
paper
to
keep
the
things
from
turning
yellow
with
age
whispered
annie
i
felt
somehow
as
though
i
were
at
a
funeral
annie
did
cry
though
as
one
might
have
expected
but
her
countenance
shone
with
a
kind
of
subdued
light
and
she
looked
like
an
angel
she
shook
out
a
soft
white
crêpe
de
chine
dress
made
over
silk
it
looked
as
fresh
as
though
it
had
just
come
from
the
dressmaker
in
another
wrapper
was
a
lovely
real
lace
scarf
and
in
yet
another
some
white
silk
stockings
oh
annie
annie
and
i
jumped
up
and
down
for
joy
they
are
exactly
right
for
you
and
see
how
carefully
they
have
been
packed
not
a
wrinkle
in
the
dress
here
take
off
your
clothes
and
try
it
on
mother
wore
it
at
the
charity
bazaar
where
she
met
father
her
rich
cousin
had
just
had
it
made
for
her
and
the
excited
child
began
to
take
off
her
shabby
blouse
and
skirt
all
you
will
need
for
the
concert
is
white
slippers
and
you
will
surely
wear
mine
just
to
let
me
know
you
love
me
i
begged
annie
flushed
and
i
was
afraid
her
stubborn
pride
was
going
to
master
her
but
she
astonished
me
by
saying
yes
i
will
wear
them
if
you
will
lend
them
to
me
i
remember
mother
told
me
she
had
to
borrow
slippers
from
a
friend
that
night
but
she
knew
her
friend
loved
her
and
so
did
not
mind
i
slipped
the
dress
over
her
head
but
as
she
pushed
her
arm
into
the
sleeve
she
stopped
and
drew
her
hand
quickly
out
wait
the
sleeve
is
pinned
so
it
was
and
pinned
through
a
letter
that
was
sealed
and
addressed
to
annie
from
mother
exclaimed
the
girl
trembling
with
excitement
every
now
and
then
i
find
a
little
note
from
her
she
knew
she
could
not
live
for
a
long
time
before
she
died
out
fluttered
two
bills
and
a
five
wrapped
in
a
tiny
penciled
note
my
darling
the
time
may
come
when
you
will
wish
to
wear
this
dress
that
i
have
saved
so
carefully
for
you
and
when
that
time
comes
you
may
also
want
a
little
money
that
perhaps
you
will
not
have
money
for
clothes
i
mean
i
give
you
this
dollars
for
your
very
own
to
spend
as
your
needs
require
it
is
not
much
but
it
may
help
you
to
look
like
other
girls
fathers
do
not
always
understand
what
girls
need
but
mothers
know
i
earned
this
money
myself
giving
singing
lessons
to
the
blacksmith
daughter
and
you
helped
me
by
keeping
store
while
i
taught
so
you
can
take
added
pleasure
in
spending
it
mother
something
happened
right
here
that
was
to
say
the
least
unexpected
i
page
allison
gave
up
and
cried
like
a
baby
i
know
i
had
cried
so
since
old
buster
my
pointer
died
and
annie
pore
instead
of
bawling
which
she
would
have
been
perfectly
justified
in
doing
never
shed
a
tear
but
with
that
exalted
look
on
her
face
which
she
had
worn
from
the
time
she
opened
the
box
she
actually
comforted
me
by
patting
me
on
the
back
and
smoothing
my
hair
page
page
it
all
right
do
be
so
miserable
she
said
as
she
endeavored
to
soothe
me
so
i
blew
my
blooming
nose
and
made
her
go
on
trying
on
the
dress
it
was
a
wonderful
fit
just
a
little
too
long
for
a
girl
of
fifteen
but
we
hemmed
it
up
in
no
time
strange
to
say
although
the
dress
was
more
than
twenty
years
old
it
was
not
out
of
style
but
cut
very
much
according
to
the
prevailing
mode
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
dame
fortune
is
quite
like
the
old
preacher
who
wrote
a
barrel
of
sermons
and
when
he
had
preached
them
all
he
just
turned
the
barrel
and
began
again
fashions
and
styles
get
put
in
the
barrel
only
to
appear
again
after
so
many
years
have
you
a
catalogue
for
a
house
page
because
i
want
to
spend
my
money
right
off
yes
i
get
it
for
you
just
as
soon
as
my
nose
dies
down
a
little
i
do
want
tweedles
to
know
i
been
crying
what
are
you
going
to
get
plenty
of
middy
blouses
and
a
good
skirt
to
wear
with
them
some
dancing
slippers
and
some
kind
of
simple
dress
i
can
put
on
in
the
evening
if
the
money
can
be
stretched
to
it
i
was
sure
it
could
with
careful
ordering
and
in
a
few
minutes
i
thought
my
nose
would
bear
inspection
so
i
went
back
to
to
get
the
catalogue
tweedles
was
out
visiting
so
i
did
not
have
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
their
curiosity
annie
and
i
soon
found
exactly
the
right
things
in
my
wonder
book
and
we
had
the
letter
written
ordering
the
things
before
the
warning
bell
rang
for
visiting
to
cease
i
fancy
father
would
be
awfully
cut
up
if
he
could
know
i
am
spending
all
of
this
money
on
my
clothes
but
he
need
know
anything
about
it
i
can
wear
my
old
things
during
the
holidays
and
next
summer
oh
annie
i
broke
in
you
are
making
an
awful
mistake
if
you
do
not
let
your
father
know
all
about
this
letter
from
your
mother
and
take
him
into
your
confidence
immediately
it
would
be
fair
to
him
if
you
did
not
fair
to
father
i
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
i
am
afraid
he
will
be
awfully
angry
with
me
how
could
he
be
are
you
doing
exactly
what
your
mother
tells
you
to
i
tell
you
honey
it
pays
every
time
to
be
perfectly
frank
you
try
and
see
if
it
does
the
warning
bell
rang
and
i
had
to
beat
a
hasty
retreat
but
before
i
went
i
kissed
poor
little
annie
and
she
clung
to
me
and
whispered
i
know
you
are
right
and
i
write
to
father
and
send
him
mother
letter
that
a
good
girl
but
annie
get
your
letter
off
to
new
york
for
your
things
first
before
the
governor
has
time
to
veto
it
well
what
ho
exclaimed
the
twins
as
they
tore
in
to
our
rooms
undressing
as
they
came
to
beat
the
lights
out
bell
to
bed
tell
us
all
about
annie
there
nothing
to
tell
i
declared
making
the
mental
reservation
that
there
was
nothing
i
could
tell
except
that
her
father
sent
her
a
pretty
white
crêpe
de
chine
dress
that
she
is
going
to
look
charming
in
and
she
has
consented
to
borrow
my
white
slippers
for
the
occasion
oh
how
splendid
cried
dum
but
dee
looked
at
me
very
solemnly
and
said
page
allison
i
know
where
to
put
my
confidence
annie
pore
has
told
you
the
story
of
her
life
and
wild
horses
could
not
drag
it
from
you
i
would
have
even
known
she
had
told
if
your
precious
little
freckled
nose
was
as
red
as
a
cherry
i
felt
awfully
foolish
but
i
borrowed
my
policy
from
the
tar
baby
an
kep
on
sayin
nothin
after
the
light
was
out
i
gave
a
little
audible
chuckle
as
i
lay
there
going
over
in
my
mind
the
very
exciting
happenings
of
the
evening
i
chuckled
to
think
what
mabel
binks
would
say
if
she
knew
the
despised
orphan
annie
was
the
granddaughter
of
a
baronet
on
her
father
side
and
the
of
an
earl
on
her
mother
chapter
xiii
the
concert
the
concert
was
a
great
affair
they
had
not
only
the
singing
and
playing
from
the
musical
pupils
but
refreshments
afterward
and
a
little
reception
many
of
the
townspeople
came
and
the
boys
from
our
assembly
hall
was
full
to
overflowing
miss
jane
cox
was
in
a
highly
nervous
state
i
have
two
pupils
who
will
sing
flat
she
confided
to
me
and
if
they
do
it
i
die
of
mortification
well
annie
pore
is
going
to
do
you
credit
anyhow
i
feel
sure
i
said
hoping
miss
cox
would
take
a
more
cheerful
view
yes
i
am
looking
to
her
to
save
the
day
have
you
seen
her
she
looks
beautiful
i
had
seen
her
in
fact
i
had
hooked
her
up
my
slippers
fitted
finely
and
annie
dress
was
without
doubt
the
one
on
the
stage
that
evening
mabel
binks
headed
the
programme
with
a
flashy
selection
on
the
piano
she
was
in
her
element
showing
off
everything
about
her
proclaimed
dernier
of
fashion
even
her
hair
was
the
latest
creation
of
twists
and
rolls
her
hands
were
covered
with
rings
and
her
arms
had
several
bracelets
in
the
form
of
snakes
coiling
around
them
these
rings
and
bracelets
had
a
way
of
clicking
ever
so
slightly
but
just
enough
to
accentuate
the
effect
that
her
performance
was
a
purely
mechanical
one
pianola
whispered
dee
to
me
dee
and
i
had
captured
dear
old
captain
leahy
and
made
him
sit
between
us
the
old
fellow
was
in
fine
feather
and
full
of
jokes
miss
peyton
smiled
approval
when
she
saw
that
we
had
taken
care
of
her
old
friend
who
always
came
to
the
school
entertainments
by
her
especial
invitation
and
do
ye
call
that
music
i
rather
hear
bye
and
bye
played
on
the
whistle
of
an
engine
by
a
freight
engineer
on
our
line
than
that
rattle
bang
the
freight
engineer
puts
some
sowl
into
his
worrk
some
meaning
he
wants
to
let
his
frinds
know
he
is
home
and
his
wife
to
know
that
is
toime
to
put
on
the
frying
pan
and
get
the
pot
to
but
that
what
does
that
mean
nothing
but
nimble
fingers
there
no
heart
in
it
just
noise
we
heartily
agreed
with
the
old
man
but
at
the
close
of
performance
there
was
such
a
storm
of
applause
from
the
juniors
who
were
her
especial
admirers
that
the
perfunctory
clapping
from
the
rest
of
the
audience
was
completely
drowned
she
bowed
and
smiled
and
rattled
her
bangles
and
then
sat
down
and
played
annie
laurie
with
her
foot
on
the
loud
pedal
all
the
time
and
with
all
the
variations
possible
to
weave
around
the
beautiful
old
air
now
is
that
too
mabel
binksy
for
anything
hissed
dum
in
my
ear
she
was
right
behind
us
sitting
next
to
harvie
price
who
had
sought
us
out
on
his
arrival
at
gresham
she
knows
perfectly
well
that
annie
pore
is
to
sing
laurie
and
she
chose
that
for
her
encore
deliberately
and
without
the
knowledge
of
miss
cox
or
the
piano
teacher
either
cat
and
why
should
ye
insult
poor
pussy
so
miss
tucker
asked
the
captain
who
had
overheard
dum
remark
i
have
a
cat
to
me
name
who
would
do
such
a
trick
annie
followed
mabel
immediately
i
wondered
if
she
would
be
upset
by
mabel
having
just
played
her
song
but
she
was
not
a
whit
she
whispered
to
miss
cox
who
was
to
play
her
accompaniment
and
they
evidently
decided
to
change
the
program
as
annie
came
on
the
stage
i
verily
believe
half
of
the
girls
did
not
at
first
recognize
her
her
dress
had
that
unmistakable
air
that
a
good
dressmaker
can
give
and
twenty
years
had
not
diminished
the
style
but
it
was
annie
walk
and
manner
that
astonished
everyone
even
her
best
friends
could
this
be
the
same
tearful
little
annie
she
was
really
little
but
i
always
had
thought
of
her
as
small
just
because
she
seemed
to
need
protection
she
was
quite
as
well
grown
as
the
tuckers
and
a
little
larger
than
i
was
her
carriage
had
dignity
and
there
was
a
poise
and
ease
to
her
that
is
rare
in
a
school
girl
miss
cox
played
the
opening
bars
to
tom
moore
beautiful
and
touching
song
believe
me
if
all
those
endearing
young
charms
and
annie
sang
with
the
simplicity
and
confidence
of
a
great
artist
believe
me
if
all
those
endearing
young
charms
which
i
gaze
on
so
fondly
were
to
change
by
and
fleet
in
my
arms
like
fairy
gifts
fading
away
thou
wouldst
still
be
adored
as
this
moment
thou
art
let
thy
loveliness
fade
as
it
will
and
around
the
dear
ruin
each
wish
of
my
heart
would
entwine
itself
verdantly
still
it
is
not
while
beauty
and
youth
are
thine
own
and
thy
cheek
unprofaned
by
a
tear
that
the
fervor
and
faith
of
a
soul
may
be
known
to
which
time
will
but
make
thee
more
dear
no
the
heart
that
has
truly
loved
never
forgets
but
as
truly
loves
on
to
the
close
as
the
sunflower
turns
to
her
god
when
he
sets
the
same
look
which
she
turned
when
he
rose
there
is
something
in
that
song
that
touches
everyone
old
and
young
as
annie
finished
for
a
moment
there
was
perfect
silence
and
then
such
an
ovation
as
the
little
english
girl
did
have
old
captain
leahy
beat
his
peg
leg
on
the
floor
forgetting
me
manners
in
me
enthusiasm
he
declared
annie
bowed
and
smiled
no
more
flustrated
than
alma
gluck
would
have
been
did
you
ever
see
such
stage
presence
whispered
dee
why
she
is
more
at
home
there
than
we
are
in
in
our
kimonos
that
because
she
loves
to
sing
and
knows
she
can
do
it
and
at
the
risk
of
being
considered
annie
claque
i
started
fresh
applause
which
was
taken
up
by
the
whole
audience
and
after
another
whispered
conference
with
miss
cox
annie
sang
again
this
time
it
was
bonnie
sweet
bessie
the
maid
of
dundee
these
were
songs
her
mother
had
taught
her
and
i
could
almost
fancy
the
spirit
of
the
mother
had
entered
into
the
daughter
i
could
almost
see
her
mother
as
she
sang
harvie
price
said
to
me
later
on
i
believe
annie
voice
is
going
to
be
stronger
than
her
mother
and
it
has
the
same
note
of
pathos
in
it
why
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
keep
from
sobbing
when
she
sang
bessie
and
did
you
see
shorty
why
shorty
had
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
and
now
he
pretends
he
has
caught
a
bad
cold
is
she
pretty
too
the
old
man
must
have
loosened
up
some
to
get
that
swell
dress
for
her
grandfather
wrote
me
the
other
day
that
mr
pore
is
so
economical
these
days
that
he
wo
go
to
church
because
he
does
not
want
to
part
with
his
nickel
he
says
he
is
making
money
too
on
the
store
since
there
is
absolutely
no
competition
at
the
landing
i
am
so
glad
you
liked
her
dress
i
answered
nearly
dead
to
tell
this
nice
sympathetic
boy
all
about
it
but
keeping
to
my
role
of
father
confessor
i
naturally
said
nothing
about
how
she
came
by
it
i
am
hoping
i
can
spend
part
of
next
summer
with
my
grandfather
continued
harvey
you
know
my
governor
and
his
father
fell
out
about
politics
and
i
had
to
stop
going
there
but
thank
goodness
they
have
made
up
now
father
would
vote
for
roosevelt
while
grandfather
thinks
anybody
belonging
to
him
must
be
a
democrat
and
not
long
ago
father
decided
that
president
wilson
was
after
all
about
the
best
president
we
have
ever
had
so
he
wrote
to
grandfather
and
said
he
was
sorry
he
had
ever
voted
for
a
republican
and
now
the
row
is
over
and
the
family
is
reunited
grandfather
is
very
arbitrary
and
of
course
it
is
hard
to
live
with
him
but
he
is
the
kindest
and
most
generous
old
man
and
i
truly
love
him
annie
pore
says
he
is
charming
and
delightful
and
that
her
mother
cared
so
much
for
him
i
said
feeling
that
that
much
of
annie
talk
with
me
it
would
be
all
right
to
repeat
this
conversation
with
harvie
was
after
the
concert
when
we
were
having
refreshments
in
the
gymnasium
the
concert
had
gone
off
very
well
miss
cox
was
jubilant
because
her
pupils
who
would
sing
flat
had
refrained
for
the
occasion
miss
cox
herself
had
sung
delightfully
and
had
won
the
heart
of
old
captain
leahy
by
giving
the
wearing
of
the
green
as
an
encore
when
the
programme
was
all
over
and
everyone
had
done
the
best
she
could
miss
peyton
made
a
little
speech
and
said
that
by
especial
request
from
some
of
the
older
guests
miss
annie
pore
was
to
sing
annie
laurie
that
was
really
the
treat
of
the
evening
we
were
delighted
because
it
made
mabel
binks
so
mad
i
am
some
weary
of
that
sob
stuff
from
annie
i
heard
her
say
to
one
of
the
boys
why
i
think
it
is
great
was
his
unsympathetic
reply
and
what
a
little
beauty
she
is
too
once
off
the
stage
annie
shyness
returned
in
full
force
but
it
soon
wore
off
under
the
genial
good
fellowship
of
the
tuckers
and
mary
flannigan
and
harvie
air
of
pride
in
her
success
and
shorty
funny
reproaches
for
making
him
catch
such
a
bad
cold
she
looked
very
happy
and
not
even
mabel
binks
could
mar
her
cheerfulness
although
she
plainly
heard
mabel
say
to
a
junior
i
wonder
who
lent
her
that
dress
it
certainly
looks
familiar
to
me
and
anyone
could
see
it
was
shortened
for
the
occasion
my
stitches
were
not
so
small
as
they
might
have
been
chapter
xiv
the
spread
saturday
night
was
a
great
time
for
spreads
as
there
was
no
study
hall
on
that
evening
and
the
girls
could
come
early
and
stay
late
a
grand
feast
was
in
preparation
at
carter
hall
tucker
had
sent
a
box
that
had
passed
inspection
at
the
office
although
it
was
filled
with
contraband
articles
but
as
he
wrote
tweedles
they
would
make
rules
if
they
did
not
expect
them
to
be
broken
my
i
glad
miss
peyton
does
put
us
on
our
honor
not
to
have
cake
and
such
said
dee
as
she
opened
up
a
box
stamped
with
the
name
of
a
drygoods
firm
and
plainly
marked
in
a
masculine
hand
virginia
shoes
the
fourth
pair
she
has
had
since
spring
and
she
must
be
more
careful
and
have
her
old
ones
is
old
zebedee
a
peach
look
tango
sandwiches
the
catalogue
to
gresham
plainly
says
nothing
but
crackers
fruit
and
simple
candy
is
allowed
to
be
eaten
in
the
rooms
here
are
olives
done
up
to
look
like
shoe
polish
said
i
diving
into
the
big
box
and
what
is
this
big
round
parcel
at
the
bottom
on
it
i
read
caroline
winter
hat
i
think
you
are
a
very
vain
girl
to
insist
on
your
winter
hat
just
to
wear
it
home
on
the
train
for
christmas
i
hope
it
is
not
mashed
but
think
it
would
serve
you
right
for
thinking
so
much
about
your
appearance
the
hat
proved
to
be
a
great
caramel
cake
stuck
all
over
with
english
walnuts
packed
so
carefully
it
was
not
a
bit
mashed
jars
of
pickle
masqueraded
shamelessly
as
uneeda
biscuit
being
ingeniously
pasted
up
in
the
original
wrappers
cream
cheese
and
pimento
sandwiches
came
dressed
as
graham
wafers
and
a
whole
roasted
chicken
had
had
a
very
comfortable
journey
buttoned
up
in
dum
old
sweater
with
a
note
pinned
over
its
faithful
breast
saying
that
dum
must
make
out
with
that
sweater
for
another
season
as
tucker
could
not
put
up
with
her
selfish
extravagance
we
heard
afterward
that
miss
sears
whose
duty
it
had
been
to
inspect
this
box
before
it
was
delivered
to
the
girls
had
said
that
she
was
surprised
to
find
that
jeffry
tucker
did
not
spoil
the
twins
nearly
so
much
as
she
had
been
led
to
believe
in
fact
he
seemed
to
be
rather
strict
with
them
and
quite
critical
for
instance
an
old
sweater
that
he
expected
dum
to
wear
through
the
season
was
not
really
fit
to
be
seen
in
there
were
several
boxes
of
candy
besides
all
the
other
goodies
they
were
all
marked
peppermint
but
were
really
candied
fruit
chocolates
nougat
and
what
not
i
tell
you
zebedee
is
some
provider
when
he
gets
started
said
dee
i
glad
i
did
eat
much
dinner
and
i
intend
to
eat
no
supper
at
all
we
were
taking
stock
of
our
eatables
before
supper
bell
so
we
could
see
how
many
girls
we
could
invite
to
the
spread
it
was
etiquette
at
gresham
to
give
a
girl
fair
warning
when
a
spread
was
under
way
so
she
could
save
space
and
not
go
and
fill
up
in
the
we
wanted
to
avoid
feeling
like
the
old
countryman
who
had
his
first
experience
with
a
table
dinner
not
knowing
there
was
to
be
so
much
following
the
first
course
he
ate
too
much
of
it
and
afterward
loudly
lamented
thar
i
sot
chock
full
er
soup
annie
pore
was
of
course
on
the
list
and
funny
little
mary
flannigan
and
the
two
seniors
sally
coles
and
josephine
barr
they
had
been
especially
nice
to
our
crowd
and
we
were
anxious
to
show
them
some
attention
that
made
seven
in
all
we
really
got
food
for
one
more
or
even
two
declared
dee
but
maybe
we
had
better
go
easy
because
there
is
really
not
room
for
more
was
rather
crowded
with
the
three
beds
two
bureaus
three
chairs
and
a
table
and
seven
girls
would
just
about
fill
it
to
overflowing
it
did
not
look
like
the
bare
cell
that
had
so
appalled
us
on
our
day
of
entering
gresham
we
now
had
a
scrim
curtain
at
the
window
rugs
on
the
floor
tweedles
had
pretty
roman
blankets
on
their
beds
with
bright
sofa
cushions
while
i
had
a
beautiful
log
cabin
quilt
that
sally
winn
had
pieced
for
me
in
between
her
different
death
throes
the
walls
were
literally
covered
with
pennants
from
many
schools
and
colleges
with
a
few
pictures
that
dum
had
stuck
in
her
trunk
purloined
from
their
apartment
in
richmond
i
do
believe
zebedee
will
ever
miss
them
and
they
mean
a
lot
to
me
she
had
said
when
dee
had
expressed
astonishment
on
her
producing
them
from
her
trunk
i
am
so
constituted
that
i
just
got
to
have
something
beautiful
to
look
at
every
now
and
then
the
room
was
pleasant
and
cozy
but
the
crowded
walls
rather
got
on
my
nerves
bracken
was
so
big
and
simple
some
people
would
have
called
it
bare
that
i
could
not
get
used
to
such
a
conglomeration
in
a
bedroom
i
kept
my
taste
to
myself
however
as
they
were
two
to
one
and
no
doubt
my
ideas
of
decoration
were
very
and
out
of
date
sally
coles
and
jo
barr
whom
we
sought
out
before
supper
were
glad
to
accept
and
vowed
they
would
eat
not
a
bite
before
the
feast
so
that
they
could
come
perfectly
empty
of
course
annie
pore
and
mary
flannigan
were
holding
themselves
in
readiness
for
the
arrival
of
the
promised
box
from
tucker
and
the
news
of
its
having
come
safely
to
hand
was
greeted
with
enthusiasm
you
get
tired
of
any
steady
food
except
home
food
and
sometimes
you
think
you
are
tired
of
that
but
as
a
rule
you
are
pretty
glad
to
get
back
to
it
i
fancy
the
table
at
gresham
was
kept
up
about
as
well
as
any
boarding
school
but
we
knew
that
as
sure
as
tuesday
was
coming
roast
veal
was
coming
too
and
wednesday
would
bring
with
it
veal
potpie
thursday
beefsteak
and
friday
fish
saturday
lamb
stew
with
dumplings
sunday
roast
chicken
and
monday
not
much
of
anything
this
certainty
bored
us
and
sometimes
i
used
to
think
if
i
could
find
something
in
the
potpie
besides
veal
i
scream
i
had
to
do
a
lot
of
looking
at
the
mountains
on
wednesday
somehow
a
spread
was
a
godsend
and
an
invitation
to
one
was
not
as
a
rule
given
in
vain
as
sally
coles
and
i
together
in
the
gym
after
supper
she
whispered
in
my
ear
it
certainly
good
of
you
kids
to
ask
jo
and
me
we
crazy
about
coming
we
think
it
pretty
nice
of
you
seniors
to
come
you
did
even
know
we
are
to
have
caramel
cake
either
did
you
i
answered
heavens
no
i
mighty
glad
we
did
accept
mabel
binks
bid
to
a
welsh
rarebit
in
her
room
we
fibbed
and
told
her
we
had
a
partial
engagement
it
was
just
with
each
other
but
we
did
tell
her
that
and
now
you
sophomores
have
saved
our
souls
by
making
our
imaginary
engagement
a
real
one
i
hate
to
tell
even
a
white
lie
but
i
hate
a
deal
more
to
have
to
go
to
a
spread
of
mabel
binks
giving
do
you
know
the
hammers
will
be
flying
ca
you
hear
mabel
and
those
rapid
juniors
she
runs
with
knocking
everything
and
everybody
yes
i
reckon
the
only
way
to
save
your
skin
is
to
stay
with
her
and
help
knock
but
how
does
she
manage
a
rarebit
when
we
are
not
allowed
to
have
chafing
dishes
manages
the
same
way
you
and
the
tuckers
manage
to
have
caramel
cake
i
fancy
we
are
not
allowed
to
have
cake
either
of
course
it
is
easier
to
hide
a
cake
than
it
is
a
chafing
dish
especially
if
the
cake
is
sliced
and
there
are
a
empty
girls
to
help
i
believe
some
of
the
girls
keep
their
chafing
dishes
under
their
mattresses
did
you
hide
your
cake
well
before
you
came
down
to
supper
it
would
be
the
psychological
moment
for
some
busybody
to
make
an
inspecting
tour
and
then
cake
oh
you
scare
me
to
death
and
i
grabbed
dee
who
was
whirling
by
trying
a
brand
new
step
with
a
giddy
junior
and
whispering
warning
to
her
we
beat
a
hasty
retreat
our
beloved
cake
was
on
the
table
covered
with
a
napkin
just
as
we
had
left
it
seemingly
but
on
raising
the
cloth
we
discovered
that
a
great
wedge
had
been
cut
out
of
it
well
of
all
the
mean
tricks
spluttered
dee
who
do
you
thank
goodness
they
only
took
about
a
fourth
what
is
left
is
enough
to
give
all
seven
of
us
fever
blisters
caramel
cake
with
nuts
in
it
always
gives
me
fever
blisters
i
laughed
but
i
do
mind
i
take
the
cake
fever
blisters
and
all
every
time
me
too
well
i
hope
that
the
thief
will
have
a
mouth
full
of
them
said
dee
vindictively
well
honey
it
a
sight
better
to
have
some
mean
girl
take
off
one
fourth
than
some
teacher
in
her
mistaken
zeal
take
off
the
whole
thing
and
give
us
demerits
besides
here
your
handkerchief
i
said
picking
up
a
little
pink
crêpe
de
chine
one
from
the
floor
not
mine
i
do
possess
such
a
thing
do
you
know
zebedee
and
dum
and
i
use
the
same
sized
handkerchiefs
when
we
want
a
handkerchief
we
want
a
handkerchief
not
a
little
pink
dab
it
must
be
yours
no
i
have
any
crêpe
de
chine
ones
here
an
initial
b
it
certainly
is
scented
up
the
finishing
touch
to
mabel
binks
costume
on
the
afternoon
we
had
seen
the
game
at
came
back
to
me
suddenly
the
strong
odor
of
musk
the
handkerchief
smelt
exactly
the
same
way
well
dee
i
reckon
it
wo
take
a
sherlock
holmes
to
say
who
took
the
cake
now
let
not
give
her
back
her
hanky
until
if
we
took
it
to
her
she
would
know
that
we
are
on
to
her
and
she
would
be
just
mean
enough
to
peach
on
us
and
have
our
cake
seized
so
we
determined
like
dee
and
prosper
le
gai
to
bide
our
time
what
a
spread
we
did
have
and
what
fun
dum
turned
up
with
two
more
girls
members
of
our
class
and
there
was
enough
and
to
spare
tucker
was
as
lavish
as
mammy
susan
herself
we
had
no
plates
or
glasses
but
we
had
plenty
of
box
tops
for
dishes
and
our
toothbrush
mugs
served
as
loving
cups
to
drink
the
very
sour
lemonade
dee
made
in
the
water
pitcher
the
same
knife
carved
the
chicken
then
cut
the
cake
the
olives
always
difficult
to
extract
from
the
bottle
were
poured
into
the
soap
dish
which
i
had
scoured
hard
enough
to
suit
the
most
squeamish
my
what
good
eats
exclaimed
jo
barr
and
how
did
you
ever
smuggle
that
cake
within
the
lines
we
showed
her
the
wrapper
it
had
come
in
and
the
stern
note
from
tucker
well
if
that
does
beat
all
i
tell
you
there
is
nothing
like
being
smart
enough
to
keep
the
eleventh
commandment
shalt
not
get
found
out
i
had
a
whole
fruitcake
taken
bodaciously
from
me
last
year
i
am
always
breaking
the
eleventh
and
that
was
so
poor
jo
always
got
caught
up
with
well
i
tell
you
one
thing
said
the
wise
sally
that
cake
had
better
skidoo
until
danger
of
inspection
passes
teachers
are
a
suspicious
lot
i
just
got
it
whisked
under
a
down
cushion
on
dee
bed
when
there
was
a
sharp
rap
on
the
door
come
in
we
called
in
a
chorus
it
was
miss
sears
rather
astonished
at
our
ready
invitation
to
enter
oh
girls
having
a
spread
are
you
glancing
sharply
at
the
packages
of
crackers
and
peppermint
candy
without
coming
all
the
way
into
the
room
well
i
hope
you
will
have
a
nice
time
wo
you
join
us
miss
sears
asked
dum
sweetly
oh
thank
you
no
i
am
on
inspection
duty
and
she
closed
the
door
never
seeing
that
jo
had
wrapped
the
roasted
chicken
up
in
a
spangled
scarf
she
was
sporting
that
chicken
had
had
all
kinds
of
dressing
in
its
fat
young
life
first
its
own
feathers
then
the
dressing
which
is
really
the
then
the
dressing
which
is
really
the
stuffing
then
dum
old
sweater
and
now
jo
fine
scarf
we
proceeded
then
to
put
the
good
appetizing
food
where
nothing
short
of
an
could
inspect
so
thorough
were
those
nine
girls
that
not
a
crumb
of
cake
nor
scrap
of
sandwich
was
left
to
tell
on
us
the
chicken
bones
were
some
problem
but
we
decided
that
if
each
girl
took
a
bone
and
disposed
of
it
it
would
simplify
matters
somewhat
sally
got
the
wishbone
and
said
she
was
going
to
gild
it
and
put
it
on
her
memory
string
when
we
had
eaten
to
repletion
we
demanded
stunts
from
those
gifted
that
way
mary
did
a
dog
fight
and
new
turn
she
had
just
mastered
going
like
a
mouse
i
wish
i
could
think
it
was
a
mouse
who
nibbled
the
cake
sighed
dum
it
kind
of
hurts
me
all
over
to
feel
that
somebody
did
it
well
if
it
was
a
mouse
i
bet
it
sounded
like
this
and
mary
imitated
mabel
binks
nasal
speech
until
we
almost
had
hysterics
why
do
you
fancy
she
took
only
a
hunk
instead
of
the
whole
cake
i
asked
it
would
have
been
so
much
more
like
her
to
take
it
all
that
the
reason
she
only
took
part
she
thought
by
behaving
out
of
character
she
would
throw
us
off
the
scent
suggested
sally
well
if
she
wanted
to
throw
us
off
the
scent
she
should
have
dropped
her
handkerchief
said
dee
but
let
forget
it
and
think
of
something
pleasant
annie
you
sing
please
and
she
handed
jo
guitar
to
the
blushing
annie
annie
was
always
embarrassed
when
she
had
to
sing
before
a
few
persons
she
got
her
stage
presence
when
there
was
a
real
audience
what
shall
it
be
asked
annie
oh
something
real
sentimental
and
lovesick
demanded
sally
who
was
supposed
to
be
engaged
and
with
a
little
humorous
twinkle
in
her
usually
sad
eyes
annie
sang
sally
in
our
alley
of
all
the
girls
that
are
so
smart
there
none
like
pretty
sally
she
is
the
darling
of
my
heart
and
she
lives
in
our
alley
there
is
no
lady
in
the
land
is
half
so
sweet
as
sally
she
is
the
darling
of
my
heart
and
she
lives
in
our
alley
of
all
the
days
that
in
the
week
i
dearly
love
but
one
day
and
that
the
day
that
comes
betwixt
a
saturday
and
monday
for
then
i
dressed
all
in
my
best
to
walk
abroad
with
sally
she
is
the
darling
of
my
heart
and
she
lives
in
our
alley
then
dum
and
dee
stood
back
to
back
and
buttoned
themselves
up
in
their
sweaters
which
they
had
put
on
and
impersonated
the
woman
singing
a
duet
the
mocking
bird
is
singing
her
grave
in
two
distinct
keys
that
was
an
awfully
funny
stunt
and
one
the
tuckers
had
made
up
themselves
before
we
had
half
exhausted
the
talent
of
the
assembled
guests
the
bell
rang
to
warn
us
that
lights
must
soon
be
out
and
we
had
to
break
up
the
next
morning
there
was
a
fine
crop
of
fever
blisters
due
to
the
very
rich
cake
annie
pore
and
sally
coles
were
the
only
ones
who
escaped
with
a
whole
skin
when
i
handed
mabel
binks
her
smelly
pink
crêpe
de
chine
handkerchief
i
noticed
that
her
rather
full
lips
were
decorated
with
a
design
similar
to
my
own
here
your
handkerchief
i
said
cake
with
caramel
and
nut
filling
is
awfully
rough
on
the
complexion
is
it
and
the
girl
had
the
decency
to
blush
chapter
xv
home
for
the
holidays
i
could
hardly
believe
that
it
was
i
page
allison
who
had
been
off
to
boarding
school
bracken
was
so
exactly
as
i
left
it
and
i
dropped
so
easily
into
my
old
habits
and
customs
that
i
felt
as
though
i
had
only
dreamed
i
had
been
away
the
dogs
almost
ate
me
up
for
joy
and
mammy
susan
had
three
kinds
of
hot
bread
for
supper
father
and
i
chatted
away
for
dear
life
for
a
while
and
then
we
just
as
naturally
settled
down
to
a
quiet
evening
of
reading
as
though
i
had
merely
been
over
to
milton
to
mail
a
letter
he
was
vastly
pleased
to
have
me
back
and
every
now
and
then
looked
over
his
glasses
at
me
with
a
very
happy
smile
on
his
dear
old
lean
face
and
i
lay
curled
up
in
a
big
chair
simply
devouring
the
last
saturday
evening
post
that
i
had
bought
on
the
train
coming
from
gresham
feeling
that
i
had
about
the
pleasantest
home
and
the
best
father
and
kindest
mammy
susan
and
the
finest
dogs
on
earth
tucker
tells
me
you
have
asked
him
down
to
hunt
i
said
as
i
surprised
a
loving
glance
from
father
yes
yes
i
thought
it
would
be
nice
if
he
could
come
when
his
girls
pay
you
their
promised
visit
he
is
mighty
good
company
i
declare
he
can
keep
a
whole
party
in
a
good
humor
and
father
chuckled
evidently
in
remembrance
of
some
witticism
of
tucker
we
are
thinking
of
getting
up
a
deer
hunt
over
in
the
swamp
jo
winn
shot
a
buck
last
month
and
i
am
told
a
great
many
persons
have
seen
deer
in
the
distance
lately
this
was
over
in
a
corner
of
our
county
where
many
small
rivers
and
creeks
formed
a
perfect
network
making
very
inaccessible
marshy
land
the
hunting
was
as
a
rule
pretty
good
and
during
the
winter
we
feasted
quite
royally
on
wild
turkey
partridge
and
rabbit
deer
of
course
were
not
so
plentiful
but
an
occasional
one
was
shot
it
seems
strange
that
virginia
the
first
state
settled
should
still
be
boasting
big
game
i
wish
you
could
take
us
dum
and
dee
would
like
it
a
lot
and
you
i
fancy
would
just
go
along
out
of
politeness
he
teased
well
you
know
i
rather
get
killed
myself
than
kill
anything
but
the
tuckers
have
their
own
guns
and
often
go
hunting
with
their
father
i
believe
they
are
very
good
shots
if
you
think
they
can
stand
the
trip
we
take
them
i
know
you
can
stand
what
i
can
stand
unless
boarding
school
has
made
you
soft
let
me
feel
your
arm
ah
as
hard
as
ever
that
basketball
and
gym
work
i
have
been
soft
indeed
if
i
gone
in
for
athletics
i
so
glad
we
can
go
i
write
to
the
twins
to
bring
their
guns
and
rough
clothes
christmas
day
came
and
went
with
plenty
of
good
cheer
and
happiness
but
none
of
the
hurry
and
bustle
of
the
christmas
in
town
at
bracken
we
knew
nothing
about
white
tissue
paper
and
christmas
seals
and
bolts
of
red
and
green
ribbon
our
simple
gifts
to
one
another
were
exchanged
without
much
ceremony
and
then
father
and
i
got
into
his
buggy
with
the
colt
ready
to
run
twenty
miles
if
he
could
get
the
bit
between
his
teeth
and
distributed
baskets
and
bags
of
candy
nuts
and
oranges
to
our
many
poor
neighbors
colored
and
white
we
always
had
a
box
of
oranges
for
the
holidays
and
simple
candy
and
mixed
nuts
by
wholesale
quantities
i
like
to
take
these
things
around
on
christmas
eve
and
let
the
little
children
think
santa
claus
brought
them
but
i
know
the
mothers
would
give
them
their
share
right
away
and
then
there
would
be
nothing
for
christmas
day
well
i
believe
they
think
is
a
kind
of
santy
anyhow
i
said
as
we
whizzed
up
to
a
particularly
cabin
that
seemed
to
be
simply
running
over
with
little
nigs
the
grimy
window
was
black
with
their
dusky
faces
and
the
doorway
was
so
full
that
the
children
in
front
were
being
pushed
out
onto
the
rickety
excuse
for
a
porch
howdy
aunt
keziah

you
and
your
family
are
well
this
beautiful

running

keziah
hobbled
out
smacking
the
little
blacks
as
she
came
with
a
very
horny
hand
but
they
seemed
to
take
it
as
a
kind
of
pleasantry

bobbed

this
last
came
with
a
voice
as
soft
as
the
wings
of
a
dove
while
the
tone
in
which
she
had
admonished
the
little
darkies
had
been
as
rough
as
a
nutmeg
grater
you
could
hardly
believe
the
two
voices
had
issued
from
the
same
lips
aunt
keziah
was
the
neighborhood
tender
that
is
she
minded
the
children
whose
natural
guardians
had
gone
away
for
one
reason
or
another
sometimes
to
work
in
the
cities
sometimes
as
house
servants
for
the
county
families
where
such
encumbrances
as
offspring
were
not
welcome
she
was
paid
a
small
sum
for
each
child
and
always
spoke
of
them
as
aunt
keziah
had
her
charity
too
as
who
has
not
and
supported
several
orphans
these
she
treated
with
especial
kindness
and
always
made
the
wait
until
the
objects
of
charity
were
helped
to
an
drippin

and
here

but
now
i
ai
got
nothin
but
a
sweet
gum
but
i
got
dat
all
right
just
then
the
colt
tired
of
standing
made
a
bolt
and
all
we
could
do
was
to
wave
to
the
funny
old
woman
and
her
fourteen
charges
old
aunt
keziah
is
bringing
up
those
children
according
to
the
teachings
of
modern
science
even
to
sterilizing
their
shirts
and
shifts
and
she
does
know
there
is
such
a
word
as
germ
i
fancy
the
many
cracks
in
the
cabin
wall
where
you
can
see
daylight
are
partly
responsible
for
the
health
of
the
i
find
more
sickness
among
the
colored
people
where
their
cabins
are
better
built
and
airtight
ventilation
is
avoided
like
the
plague
said
father
as
he
got
the
colt
under
control
and
we
went
spinning
off
to
some
more
pensioners
as
he
called
them
the
doctor
buggy
was
finally
emptied
of
its
load
and
we
skimmed
back
home
with
the
colt
as
fresh
as
ever
agreeing
that
we
would
not
give
up
horses
for
all
the
automobiles
under
the
sun
there
is
an
exhilaration
that
comes
from
driving
a
good
horse
that
i
do
not
believe
a
car
can
give
one
no
matter
how
fine
the
car
or
expert
the
driver
mammy
susan
had
a
dinner
for
us
that
was
fit
for
kings
and
queens
it
seemed
a
pity
to
cook
so
much
for
just
father
and
me
but
some
of
that
dinner
found
its
way
to
many
a
cabin
where
father
felt
it
was
most
needed
and
then
on
christmas
day
the
dogs
were
given
extra
rations
and
not
limited
to
their
one
big
feeding
of
corn
meal
and
salt
scalded
and
baked
in
a
great
pan
until
it
was
crisp
on
this
day
of
days
they
had
a
bone
apiece
and
all
kinds
of
good
scrapings
after
dinner
we
settled
ourselves
to
enjoy
the
christmas
books
of
which
there
were
many
as
our
tastes
were
well
known
father
patients
were
considerate
enough
not
to
send
for
him
all
afternoon
not
a
soul
got
sick
on
this
happy
christmas
day
even
poor
sally
winn
did
not
try
to
die
chapter
xvi
a
visit
from
the
tuckers
the
tuckers
arrived
and
neither
at
the
time
nor
by
the
route
expected
i
was
just
calling
sam
to
hitch
peg
short
for
pegasus
to
the
surrey
to
drive
to
milton
to
meet
them
when
the
unaccustomed
toot
of
an
automobile
attracted
my
attention
it
was
tearing
down
our
avenue
at
breakneck
speed
dee
was
at
the
wheel
with
tucker
beside
her
and
dum
was
bouncing
around
alone
on
the
back
seat
beat
the
train
by
jove
i
thought
we
could
exclaimed
tucker
when
he
spied
me
at
the
yard
gate
we
were
so
afraid
you
might
have
started
for
milton
that
the
reason
we
were
violating
the
speed
limit
and
they
all
piled
out
the
girls
hugging
me
and
kissing
me
and
tucker
almost
hugging
me
and
not
quite
kissing
me
it
was
such
a
grand
day
we
could
resist
coming
in
the
car
tweedled
the
twins
but
if
you
had
started
for
milton
before
we
got
here
we
would
have
died
of
mortification
when
i
told
them
i
had
not
even
had
peg
hitched
up
yet
they
were
delighted
a
mounted
policeman
chased
us
just
as
we
were
leaving
manchester
but
we
dusted
him
so
tweedles
and
i
are
hoping
he
did
not
get
our
number
said
tucker
i
called
sam
to
bring
in
the
grips
and
rugs
i
am
sorry
he
ca
take
your
steed
around
to
the
stable
tucker
but
we
do
know
a
thing
about
automobiles
at
bracken
leave
it
where
it
is
maybe
we
can
have
a
spin
later
on
we
went
into
the
house
where
the
open
wood
fires
made
everything
bright
and
cheerful
although
not
very
warm
for
persons
who
are
accustomed
to
steam
heat
mammy
susan
in
a
stiffly
starched
purple
calico
dress
with
a
gay
bandanna

snack

there
chariot
of

but
the
way

enough
to
jolt
down
a
christmus
dinner
plum
puddin
an
all
an
plum
puddin
takes
a
heap
er
joltin
and
mammy
susan
hastened
out
to
set
a
little
lunch
which
the
tuckers
later
declared
was
a
feast
they
were
hungry
and
cold
in
spite
of
their
protestations
to
the
contrary
and
cold
turkey
and
country
ham
with
the
delicious
little
cornmeal
cakes
that
mammy
could
stir
up
and
bake
in
half
a
minute
disappeared
like
magic
such
coffee
and
tucker
rolled
up
his
eyes
in
ecstasy
and
real
cow
cream
i
tell
you
tweedles
as
soon
as
you
finish
getting
this
much
needed
education
we
got
to
get
out
of
an
apartment
and
into
a
house
where
we
can
do
some
real
housekeeping
and
have
some
home
cooking
you
ought
to
be
made
to
eat
at
gresham
for
a
month
or
so
zebedee
and
you
would
think
the
café
is
pretty
fine
said
dee
the
grub
at
gresham
is
not
so
bad
but
there
is
such
a
deadly
sameness
to
it
well
the
grub
may
be
tejus
broke
in
mammy
who
had
just
come
in
with
a
plate
of
corn
cakes
but
it
must
hab
suption
in
it
lil
miss
page
is
growd
in
width
as
well
as
wisdom
and
you
two
young
twin
ladies
is
got
cheeks
like
you
are
right
mammy
the
food
must
be
pretty
good
to
keep
them
so
fat
and
rosy
said
tucker
helping
himself
plentifully
to
the
dainty
little
cakes
yassir
and
mammy
had
a
sly
twinkle
in
her
kind
old
eyes
an
that
there
caffy
whar
you
gits
yo
victuals
mus
be
dishin
out
some
nourishment
too
you
ai
to
say
peaked
lookin
how
we
did
laugh
at
zebedee
and
as
for
him
he
got
up
and
gave
mammy
a
little
hug
the
tuckers
all
knew
how
to
take
jokes
on
themselves
she
certainly
did
get
you
zebedee
teased
dum
you
were
trying
to
be
so
tuckerish
too
admonishing
dee
and
me
for
complaining
about
the
food
at
gresham
father
came
in
soon
from
his
rounds
and
greeted
the
visitors
in
his
kindly
hospitable
way
tucker
was
to
have
several
days
holiday
from
his
newspaper
and
father
said
the
neighborhood
was
in
an
extremely
healthy
condition
owing
to
the
clear
cold
weather
and
he
did
not
expect
to
be
overworked
so
the
gentlemen
began
immediately
to
plan
their
hunts
dum
and
dee
were
wild
at
the
prospect
of
going
on
the
deer
hunt
i
saw
jo
winn
this
morning
daughter
said
father
and
he
will
go
with
us
he
has
a
cousin
from
new
york
who
is
visiting
him
and
he
wants
to
take
him
well
if
the
cousin
has
no
more
conversation
than
jo
he
certainly
will
not
bore
us
with
his
chatter
i
said
now
how
about
lunch
father
we
must
give
mammy
some
warning
because
she
gets
flustrated
if
we
come
at
her
too
suddenly
suits
jo
and
his
kinsman
and
it
will
suit
us
too
i
think
tell
mammy
how
many
of
us
there
are
and
tell
her
to
put
up
twice
as
much
lunch
as
you
think
she
should
that
ought
to
be
enough
we
want
the
big
camping
coffee
pot
and
a
skillet
and
some
salt
also
some
sliced
bacon
ground
coffee
and
sugar
and
a
little
flour
to
roll
the
rabbits
in
we
may
make
a
fire
and
cook
some
if
we
get
cold
and
have
good
luck
in
the
morning
i
went
out
to
the
kitchen
to
interview
mammy
tweedles
following
me
and
then
we
had
to
go
see
the
dogs
dee
approved
of
them
and
they
heartily
approved
of
her
dum
did
not
have
the
passion
for
them
that
dee
and
i
had
but
she
liked
them
well
enough
the
dogs
licked
her
hand
respectfully
and
then
jumped
up
on
dee
and
knocked
her
down
and
had
a
big
romp
how
delightful
it
was
to
have
some
companions
of
my
own
age
at
my
beloved
bracken
the
tuckers
wanted
to
see
everything
and
go
everywhere
we
visited
the
horses
in
the
stable
and
the
cows
in
the
pen
and
climbed
up
in
the
hay
loft
to
hunt
for
eggs
that
a
sly
old
blue
hen
refused
to
lay
in
the
proper
place
it
just
like
grandpa
tucker
only
nicer
declared
dum
grandpa
treats
us
as
though
we
were
about
two
years
old
and
treats
zebedee
as
though
he
had
just
arrived
in
his
teens
so
when
we
go
there
while
we
have
splendid
times
we
are
being
told
what
not
to
do
from
morning
till
night
well
nobody
ever
has
told
me
not
to
do
things
i
said
mammy
susan
grumbles
when
she
thinks
i
am
too
venturesome
but
she
has
always
ended
by
letting
me
have
my
own
way
and
father
says
he
thinks
my
way
is
about
as
good
as
anybody
way
well
is
it
funny
you
are
not
spoiled
tweedled
the
girls
i
believe
i
used
to
be
spoiled
when
i
was
a
tiny
thing
but
father
says
if
people
grow
up
spoiled
it
is
because
they
lack
sense
and
he
always
said
he
knew
i
had
sense
enough
to
live
down
the
spoiling
that
he
and
mammy
susan
just
could
help
giving
me
i
believe
allison
is
right
dee
said
dum
very
solemnly
and
when
we
are
unruly
with
zebedee
i
know
it
is
not
the
fault
of
our
early
training
that
we
love
to
lay
it
on
but
just
plain
lack
of
sense
well
i
going
to
try
to
be
mighty
good
then
exclaimed
dee
if
there
is
anything
in
the
world
i
hate
it
stupidity
chapter
xvii
deer
hunting
it
was
a
glorious
morning
of
course
we
had
to
get
up
before
the
sun
thought
of
such
a
thing
indeed
there
was
a
crazy
old
gibbous
moon
still
hanging
on
to
life
when
we
came
piling
out
of
the
warm
lighted
house
and
climbed
into
the
two
vehicles
waiting
for
us
father
and
tucker
were
to
go
in
father
buggy
and
the
girls
and
i
were
very
snug
three
on
the
seat
of
the
runabout
with
the
lunch
and
coffee
pot
bouncing
around
in
the
back
and
the
guns
carefully
stowed
under
the
seat
jo
winn
joined
us
at
milton
the
new
york
cousin
in
the
buggy
with
him
we
were
curious
to
see
the
cousin
whom
father
had
reported
as
being
quite
likely
jo
was
as
good
as
gold
and
perfectly
intelligent
with
a
keen
sense
of
humor
but
he
was
as
silent
as
the
tomb
his
sister
sally
was
the
greatest
chatterbox
in
the
world
i
am
sure
she
simply
never
stopped
talking
except
on
those
occasions
when
she
was
doing
her
best
to
shuffle
off
this
mortal
coil
and
then
she
seemed
to
be
not
able
to
stop
talking
long
enough
to
die
thoroughly
just
when
the
grave
was
yawning
for
her
or
maybe
because
of
her
she
would
think
of
something
she
simply
had
to
talk
about
and
come
back
to
life
the
winns
were
in
that
they
were
among
the
first
families
in
virginia
if
not
of
virginia
they
were
not
aristocrats
certainly
they
came
of
good
pioneer
stock
who
were
tillers
of
the
soil
in
the
seventeenth
century
and
still
were
in
the
twentieth
they
had
lived
on
the
same
tract
of
land
for
two
centuries
and
a
half
and
in
america
that
should
stand
for
aristocracy
but
somehow
with
the
winns
it
never
had
they
had
no
desire
to
be
considered
great
folk
and
so
they
never
were
the
war
between
the
states
had
left
them
as
it
had
found
them
in
fairly
prosperous
circumstances
never
having
owned
slaves
the
emancipation
of
the
negroes
did
not
affect
them
one
way
or
the
other
having
always
done
their
own
sowing
and
reaping
they
could
still
do
it
the
family
had
never
been
much
on
marrying
and
now
there
were
none
left
but
the
hypochondriacal
old
maid
sally
and
her
younger
brother
jo
i
had
given
the
twins
a
history
of
the
winns
as
we
spun
over
to
milton
pegasus
was
in
fine
feather
which
seems
a
strange
thing
to
say
of
a
horse
but
of
one
whose
name
suggests
wings
perhaps
it
is
appropriate
i
fancy
jo
is
so
silent
because
sally
talks
so
much
suggested
dum
maybe
it
is
the
other
way
and
sally
talks
so
much
to
make
up
for
silence
i
said
but
i
hope
the
cousin
from
new
york
will
strike
a
happy
medium
a
from
new
york
always
sounds
so
exciting
and
just
as
like
as
not
he
come
from
hoboken
allison
says
he
is
about
so
i
reckon
he
not
notice
us
kids
anyhow
it
wo
break
our
hearts
that
sure
and
dee
tossed
her
head
in
disdain
of
all
males
jo
and
the
cousin
were
waiting
for
us
at
the
crossroads
the
cousin
was
a
young
man
with
blue
eyes
and
light
hair
very
picturesque
in
a
brand
new
hunting
suit
leggins
and
all
they
wo
stay
new
long
i
whispered
to
the
girls
with
jo
hounds
flopping
all
over
them
jo
was
forced
to
open
his
mouth
and
speak
as
it
was
up
to
him
to
introduce
the
cousin
but
he
did
it
in
as
few
words
as
possible
kent
miss
allison
and
then
an
appealing
glance
at
me
gave
me
to
understand
that
the
matter
was
in
my
hands
so
i
took
up
the
social
burden
and
introduced
jo
and
kent
to
the
tuckers
reginald
kent
that
was
the
picturesque
name
that
went
with
the
picturesque
corduroy
suit
proved
himself
to
be
a
young
man
of
resources
he
had
no
idea
of
taking
the
long
drive
to
the
spot
of
the
possible
deer
alone
with
the
silent
jo
the
hounds
wallowing
all
over
his
new
clothes
see
here
he
exclaimed
i
think
one
of
us
fellows
ought
to
get
in
with
the
young
ladies
they
might
need
some
protection
on
the
trip
jo
looked
very
much
amused
at
my
needing
protection
and
the
twins
certainly
looked
buxom
enough
to
take
care
of
themselves
without
the
help
of
reginald
kent
well
sort
yourselves
in
a
hurry
called
father
the
colt
wo
stand
another
minute
and
i
do
want
to
get
too
far
ahead
of
the
rest
of
you
let
me
get
in
with
winn
begged
dee
i
crazy
to
ride
with
the
dogs
jo
dogs
were
the
only
ones
going
although
the
pack
at
bracken
plead
piteously
to
be
allowed
to
join
the
party
it
seemed
best
not
to
take
too
many
and
jo
dogs
were
so
well
trained
that
the
men
had
decided
on
them
reginald
kent
squeezed
his
new
corduroys
between
dum
and
me
and
dee
jumped
into
the
buggy
with
the
grinning
jo
dee
declared
later
that
jo
talked
as
much
as
most
men
and
was
a
very
agreeable
person
but
i
fancy
the
real
truth
of
the
matter
was
that
dee
chattered
away
at
her
usual
rate
and
that
jo
was
such
an
eloquent
listener
dee
never
did
discover
that
she
was
doing
all
the
talking
certainly
they
found
a
topic
of
interest
to
both
of
them
in
the
dogs
and
as
talking
about
the
dogs
meant
patting
the
dogs
the
dogs
naturally
were
pleased
our
cavalier
proved
to
be
very
cheerful
and
very
complimentary
he
was
evidently
much
pleased
to
escape
the
silent
jo
we
liked
him
in
spite
of
his
fulsome
compliments
and
when
we
gave
him
to
understand
that
flattery
was
not
the
way
to
curry
favor
with
us
he
became
more
natural
and
we
had
a
very
amusing
time
with
him
it
turned
out
that
he
did
not
live
in
hoboken
as
dee
had
predicted
but
in
the
heart
of
new
york
city
he
was
employed
by
an
advertising
firm
not
only
as
a
writer
of
advertisements
but
also
as
illustrator
of
course
there
is
no
pleasant
way
of
making
a
living
he
said
but
i
long
to
get
out
of
this
commercial
art
and
into
regular
illustrating
but
i
adore
ads
exclaimed
dum
dee
and
zebedee
and
i
always
read
every
word
of
them
and
zebedee
says
you
can
find
more
pure
fiction
in
them
than
in
the
magazine
proper
or
improper
well
after
this
i
shall
do
my
work
more
enthusiastically
and
more
conscientiously
knowing
there
is
a
chance
of
its
coming
under
such
eyes
and
kent
glance
of
admiration
into
dum
hazel
eyes
gave
her
to
understand
he
was
speaking
of
those
particular
eyes
and
not
and
zebedee
i
rather
expected
to
see
dum
give
him
a
but
instead
she
blushed
in
rather
a
pleased
way
just
as
any
young
girl
should
on
receiving
such
a
compliment
from
a
handsome
young
man
from
new
york
the
roads
in
our
county
are
much
improved
thanks
to
the
automobilists
who
have
worked
such
reforms
throughout
the
whole
country
on
that
morning
they
were
hard
and
dry
even
dusty
and
we
went
spinning
along
through
the
frosty
air
father
ahead
with
the
colt
behaving
as
though
it
were
a
hurry
call
and
every
moment
counted
i
was
next
in
line
and
peg
was
giving
me
all
i
could
do
to
hold
her
in
she
seemed
to
want
to
let
us
all
see
that
an
upstartish
colt
could
trot
no
faster
than
she
could
i
was
rather
glad
that
reginald
kent
had
taken
a
fancy
to
hazel
eyes
instead
of
gray
as
i
needed
my
gray
eyes
to
pick
a
smooth
road
for
peg
jo
winn
and
dee
were
just
far
enough
behind
us
to
keep
out
of
our
dust
and
occasionally
we
could
hear
dee
ringing
laugh
and
an
unusual
guffaw
from
the
silent
jo
you
see
now
why
we
could
come
in
your
automobile
as
tucker
wanted
i
said
to
dum
as
father
wheeled
the
colt
sharply
to
the
left
into
a
forest
of
pines
where
scrub
oaks
and
chinquepins
almost
concealed
a
very
poor
excuse
for
a
road
come
on
daughter
father
called
back
to
me
we
keep
close
together
through
the
woods
as
there
is
no
dust
i
really
believe
that
the
road
through
that
pine
forest
is
the
very
worst
road
in
virginia
and
that
is
saying
a
good
deal
as
my
beloved
state
has
only
recently
awakened
to
the
fact
that
it
reflects
on
her
standing
to
be
noted
as
having
the
worst
roads
in
the
union
that
particular
road
had
great
granite
bowlders
ruts
that
threatened
to
swallow
us
gnarled
tree
roots
that
stretched
across
the
path
as
though
they
meant
to
trip
us
up
and
sometimes
even
a
fallen
trunk
over
which
we
would
have
to
bounce
testing
the
springs
of
our
vehicles
to
their
utmost
endurance
well
i
reckon
little
henry
ford
that
is
what
the
tuckers
called
their
car
would
have
been
ditched
long
before
this
gasped
dum
as
one
wheel
took
a
bowlder
and
the
other
a
deep
rut
miss
allison
i
have
asked
you
to
let
me
assist
you
in
driving
just
because
i
know
you
can
do
it
so
much
better
than
i
can
said
kent
i
have
turned
over
there
as
sure
as
i
born
well
i
came
mighty
near
doing
it
i
laughed
if
dum
hat
had
not
been
on
the
side
and
tilted
toward
the
bowlder
we
would
have
landed
in
the
ditch
i
know
we
had
just
about
an
ounce
weight
in
our
favor
i
guess
it
a
good
thing
i
part
my
hair
in
the
middle
in
these
hairbreadth
escapes
just
think
suppose
it
had
been
parted
on
the
left
side
and
had
counterbalanced
miss
dum
hat
tipped
toward
the
right
over
we
would
have
gone
just
then
a
molly
jumped
up
out
of
the
bracken
and
the
dogs
set
up
a
fearful
howling
it
was
all
jo
winn
and
dee
could
do
to
hold
them
in
their
places
tucker
and
dum
looked
longingly
at
their
guns
but
the
colt
would
not
stand
for
shooting
going
on
so
close
to
him
and
besides
when
people
go
out
for
deer
they
do
not
want
to
begin
on
rabbits
so
little
miss
molly
got
off
for
that
time
at
least
i
was
glad
there
is
something
in
my
that
recoils
from
killing
anything
to
be
sure
i
am
fond
of
a
rabbit
hind
leg
about
as
good
eating
as
one
can
find
but
when
i
am
picking
on
one
of
those
hind
legs
i
have
to
close
my
mind
carefully
to
the
fact
that
that
same
hind
leg
has
helped
to
carry
some
rabbit
through
many
a
briar
patch
if
the
image
comes
to
me
of
a
perky
little
white
tail
scurrying
through
the
bushes
with
the
eager
dogs
in
pursuit
i
simply
have
to
give
up
eating
the
delectable
morsel
and
mammy
susan
has
to
broil
me
some
bacon
hi

the
cabin

it
charming
it
was
indeed
a
typical
log
cabin
it
was
old
very
old
but
uncle
peter
kept
it
in
good
repair
patching
the
mortar
in
the
chinks
from
time
to
time
and
propping
up
the
great
stone
chimney
that
stood
at
about
the
angle
of
the
leaning
tower
of
pisa
on
the
door
and
walls
were
tacked
many
coon
skins
that
is
the
method
employed
for
curing
the
skins
and
uncle
peter
made
quite
a
little
money
selling
coon
skins
he
had
only
a
small
clearing
around
his
cabin
but
a
good
cornfield
down
in
the
creek
bottom
said
uncle
peter
rosana

de
swamp
what
is
always
empty
and
gwine
away
full
aunt
rosana
squeezed
herself
sideways
through
the
cabin
door
she
was
a
mountain
of
flesh
with
about
as
much
shape
as
a
football
indeed
she
looked
very
like
the
potato
babies
mammy
susan
used
to
make
me
a
big
potato
for
the
body
a
little
potato
for
a
head
stuck
on
with
a
match
feet
and
arms
of
peanuts
and
a
face
scratched
on
with
a
kitchen
fork
her
voice
sounded
like
hot
mashed
potato
as
she
bade
us
welcome
well
efn

dat
ole
shanghai
rooster

loud

clear

nuthin
but
niggers
an
swamp
niggers
at
dat
and
a
laugh
shook
her
huge
body
reminding
me
of
the
bowl
full
of
jelly
we
were
glad
to
stretch
ourselves
after
the
long
drive
and
aunt
rosana
took
us
into
her
cabin
while
the
men
of
the
party
attended
to
unhitching
the
horses
the
cabin
was
spotless
although
the
one
room
it
boasted
was
kitchen
parlor
and
bedroom
in
one
a
great
fireplace
almost
the
entire
length
of
one
side
of
the
room
was
really
the
kitchen
aunt
rosana
scorned
iron
stoves
and
still
did
her
cooking
with
and
dutch
ovens
even
now
hanging
from
one
hook
was
a
singing
black
iron
kettle
and
from
another
a
covered
pot
from
which
issued
an
aroma
that
told
me
that
uncle
peter
was
going
to
have
cabbage
for
dinner
homemade
rag
rugs
covered
the
floor
almost
entirely
but
wherever
a
spot
of
oak
flooring
showed
it
was
gleaming
white
with
much
scrubbing
a
great
had
the
place
of
honor
opposite
the
fireplace
it
was
a
bed
fit
for
the
slumbers
of
kings
and
princes
many
families
in
virginia
will
exhibit
just
such
beds
and
proudly
tell
you
that
in
those
beds
lafayette
and
washington
had
slept
i
do
know
how
uncle
peter
and
aunt
rosana
happened
to
have
it
but
i
know
that
the
beautiful
old
bed
had
never
harbored
a
more
worthy
couple
the
patchwork
quilt
with
its
intricate
pattern
was
aunt
rosana
handiwork
the
walls
were
decorated
with
brilliant
chromos
calendars
dating
back
into
the
and
on
up
to
date
the
twins
were
charmed
with
the
place
and
their
interest
was
most
flattering
to
aunt
rosana
she
showed
them
all
her
treasures
even
her
photograph
album
and
who
are
all
of
these
people
asked
dum
who
was
politely
looking

my
little
chany
valuebowles
what
i
been
collecking
of
sence
i
was
a
baby
said
aunt
rosana
to
dum
who
was
examining
a
great
array
of
little
china
ornaments
on
top
of
a
large
old
highboy
there
were
little
china
girls
kissing
little
china
boys
little
baskets
with
turtle
doves
on
the
handles
pink
puppies
and
green
cats
some
of
them
meant
for
match
safes
and
some
of
them
purely
ornamental
little
cups
and
saucers
of
every
shape
and
hue
little
pitchers
with
big
ears
and
some
with
no
ears
at
all
i
have
never
been
in
a
cabin
of
colored
people
where
there
was
not
a
chest
of
drawers
or
a
table
filled
with
similar
treasures
i
know
aunt
rosana
thought
as
much
of
her
chany
valuebowles
as
father
did
of
his
books
and
her
sensations
when
dum
almost
dropped
a
little
box
was
just
what
father
would
have
been
if
he
had
seen
a
careless
reader
turn
down
a
page
in
one
of
his
beloved
books
or
bend
back
the
covers
of
one
of
his
first
editions
do
look
at
this
begged
dum
of
kent
who
had
just
entered
the
cabin
she
held
up
in
her
hand
a
china
cow
of
a
decidedly
lavender
hue
with
horns
and
hoofs
of
gilt
and
quoted
never
saw
a
purple
cow
i
never
hope
to
see
one
but
i
can
tell
you
anyhow
i
rather
see
than
be
one
yes
i
wrote
the
purple
cow
i
sorry
now
i
wrote
it
but
i
can
tell
you
anyhow
i
kill
you
if
you
quote
it
laughed
kent
taking
the
fearful
and
wonderful
animal
in
his
hands
and
examining
it
with
great
interest
is
this
place
delightful
if
i
had
only
brought
my
sketching
things
instead
of
my
gun
i
stay
here
and
paint
i
going
to
ask
aunt
rosana
to
let
me
take
some
time
exposures
of
the
interior
of
her
cabin
just
look
at
that
bed
and
that
fireplace
thank
goodness
i
got
my
camera
with
a
perfectly
new
film
good
for
twelve
exposures
well
gawd
be
praised
dat
ole
shanghai

me
warnin

my

straightened
up

goin
ter

aunt
rosana
flesh
quivered
with
delight
chapter
xviii
the
mighty
hunter
the
pictures
were
soon
taken
and
we
were
on
our
way
to
the
low
country
everyone
carried
a
gun
but
me
uncle
peter
brought
up
the
rear
with
a
wheelbarrow
laden
with
the
it
was
a
long
walk
but
such
a
delightful
one
that
we
never
once
thought
of
getting
tired
our
way
lay
through
a
pine
forest
and
was
up
hill
and
down
dale
tweedles
and
i
were
as
well
able
to
take
the
walk
as
any
of
the
male
persuasion
although
it
took
some
time
to
make
kent
understand
that
we
could
get
along
without
his
assistance
he
would
help
dum
over
a
worm
fence
much
to
dee
and
my
amusement
as
we
knew
that
dum
could
vault
it
with
one
hand
just
as
we
did
i
never
saw
such
independent
young
ladies
as
you
three
he
confessed
after
a
daring
leap
we
had
made
over
a
gulch
the
girls
i
know
in
new
york
expect
to
be
assisted
over
every
gutter
maybe
that
their
town
manner
and
if
they
were
turned
loose
in
the
country
they
might
help
themselves
as
well
as
we
can
i
suggested
to
tell
the
truth
it
makes
me
fall
down
if
anyone
helps
me
do
you
know
whispered
dee
to
me
i
verily
believe
that
reginald
kent
person
is
getting
stuck
on
dum
i
hope
he
wo
shoot
her
i
believe
he
ever
carried
a
gun
before
in
his
life
he
handles
it
like
a
walking
stick
he
real
nice
do
you
think
i
asked
oh
yes
nice
enough
but
i
ca
see
why
dum
lets
him
boost
her
over
every
stick
and
stone
she
perfectly
she
looks
to
me
as
though
she
rather
liked
to
be
treated
like
a
boneless
vertebrate
and
dee
looked
very
disgusted
the
fact
was
that
dum
was
taking
the
helping
just
as
she
was
taking
the
compliments
in
a
perfectly
natural
girlish
way
fond
of
the
country
asked
tucker
glancing
with
an
amused
twinkle
at
kent
nonchalant
manner
of
holding
his
gun
oh
yes
fond
enough
what
i
know
of
it
i
had
to
stick
pretty
close
to
broadway
all
my
life
i
spent
a
summer
down
here
with
the
winns
once
when
i
was
a
kid
and
that
about
the
only
country
i
known
have
you
hunted
before
questioned
dum
jumping
back
from
the
barrel
of
kent
new
gun
that
was
pointing
ominously
at
her
well
i
shot
the
at
coney
island
and
have
practiced
at
hitting
the
in
the
galleries
at
that
gay
resort
until
i
can
ring
the
bell
every
time
but
that
is
the
extent
of
my
experience
and
kent
looked
a
little
wistful
i
be
mighty
glad
of
some
pointers
from
any
of
you
that
have
had
more
well
point
your
gun
barrel
down
tweedled
the
twins
ah
so
i
see
he
said
grasping
his
gun
in
a
more
sportsmanlike
manner
and
all
of
us
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
i
had
been
in
terror
for
fear
he
might
ring
a
or
hit
some
eye
not
in
a
bull
ever
since
we
left
aunt
rosana
cabin
i
awfully
green
continued
the
young
man
modestly
i
cut
a
poorer
figure
turned
loose
here
in
the
country
than
old
uncle
peter
would
on
the
great
white
way
not
a
bit
of
it
said
tucker
kindly
he
seemed
rather
impressed
by
kent
frankness
and
modesty
indeed
the
young
new
yorker
could
not
cut
a
poor
figure
anywhere
he
was
well
grown
and
sturdy
and
had
an
athletic
swing
to
his
walk
due
not
only
to
much
work
in
a
gymnasium
but
to
the
magnificent
distances
he
had
been
compelled
to
walk
in
new
york
i
have
noticed
that
persons
as
a
rule
walk
much
better
than
when
they
get
on
rough
ground
they
walk
as
though
it
were
smooth
while
country
people
when
they
strike
pavements
look
as
though
they
were
still
getting
over
plowed
ground
reginald
kent
if
he
did
not
know
how
to
carry
a
gun
knew
how
to
carry
himself
with
shoulders
back
chin
in
and
head
well
up
he
stepped
along
like
a
west
pointer
while
jo
winn
slouched
with
shoulders
bent
and
head
forward
we
chatted
away
very
merrily
until
we
came
to
the
creek
where
the
party
was
to
separate
there
was
not
much
chance
of
any
game
big
or
little
with
such
a
crowd
tramping
through
the
woods
it
was
agreed
that
father
tucker
and
jo
winn
should
cross
the
creek
and
go
on
to
the
river
where
they
were
to
take
a
skiff
owned
by
old
uncle
peter
and
kept
moored
at
a
certain
spot
known
to
father
from
there
they
were
to
go
into
the
marshes
and
later
on
come
down
the
river
and
join
us
at
the
mouth
of
the
creek
we
were
to
keep
on
straight
down
the
creek
with
uncle
peter
and
kent
who
earnestly
desired
to
stay
and
take
care
of
the
ladies
i
going
to
change
my
loads
for
rabbits
said
dee
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
this
big
shot
would
tear
a
rabbit
all
to
pieces
and
i
believe
we
are
more
apt
to
see
rabbits
than
deer
kent
followed
suit
but
dum
kept
loaded
fur
as
she
expressed
it
dee
soon
got
a
rabbit
which
she
wept
over
she
always
does
that
explained
dum
she
shoots
things
for
the
love
of
shooting
and
then
bawls
because
she
has
taken
an
innocent
life
we
had
one
of
jo
dogs
with
us
the
other
two
had
gone
with
the
three
men
to
stalk
the
possible
deer
our
dog
started
up
several
rabbits
and
kent
joyously
got
two
of
them
gee
this
beats
clay
pigeons
and
shooting
galleries
he
declared
i
feel
like
a
lion
now
since
i
have
tasted
blood
i
never
be
content
to
go
back
to
my
quiet
uneventful
life
we
pitched
camp
near
the
mouth
of
the
creek
on
a
cliff
overlooking
the
river
uncle
peter
and
i
made
a
fire
and
skinned
the
rabbits
while
the
tuckers
and
the
cavalier
went
off
in
search
of
more
game
under
a
great
ledge
of
rock
we
found
some
snow
left
from
a
storm
we
had
before
christmas
and
after
washing
the
rabbits
well
and
letting
them
stand
in
cold
water
long
enough
to
get
out
the
animal
heat
we
buried
them
in
the
snow
ter
git
the
fraishness
em
explained
uncle
peter
i
always
loved
to
mess
around
a
campfire
and
uncle
peter
proved
a
most
delightful
companion
i
like
this
a
lot
better
than
killing
things
uncle
peter
i
said
sho
child
so
do
i
been
all
my
life
but
it
ai
been
fer
pleasure
i
hunts
fer
a
livin
an

and
raked

over

yams
every
now
and
then
we
heard
a
shot
off
in
the
direction
of
the
amazons
and
their
protector
i
did
hope
the
girls
were
having
good
luck
and
would
come
back
with
game
of
some
sort
uncle
peter
and
i
got
out

and
began
to
prepare
for
the
hunters
who
experience
told

uncle
peter
an
victuals
cooked

open
seems
ter
be
mo
dan
de
ones
in
kitchens
first
we
fried
the
bacon
and
then
put
it
in
a
covered
pan
to
keep
hot
and
used
the
bacon
grease
to
fry
the
rabbits
which
we
had
seasoned
very
highly
and
rolled
in
flour
i
filled
the
coffee
pot
with
fresh
water
from
a
bubbling
spring
near
by
and
resting
it
on
two
stones
about
six
inches
apart
i
raked
out
hot
coals
and
soon
it
began
to
heat
up
i
had
just
completed
this
culinary
feat
when
uncle
peter
whispered
to
me
look
chile
down
yander
by
the
ribber
the
cliff
where
we
had
pitched
our
little
camp
overlooked
the
river
and
about
a
hundred
yards
from
the
base
of
our
cliff
was
a
graveled
ford
or
shallows
the
scrub
growth
was
close
down
to
the
water
edge
but
stretching
out
into
the
stream
was
a
little
sandy
beach
beyond
the
scrub
growth
rose
the
dark
pines
and
an
occasional
oak
with
its
great
bare
branches
towered
above
all
meaner
trees
from
the
underbrush
had
stepped
a
young
buck
he
was
picking
his
way
daintily
across
the
pebbles
to
the
water
edge
how
beautiful
he
was
i
wanted
our
guests
to
have
good
sport
but
i
longed
with
a
longing
that
was
almost
a
prayer
that
no
one
with
a
gun
was
seeing
what
uncle
peter
and
i
were
seeing
what
wind
there
was
came
from
his
direction
so
he
got
no
scent
of
us
and
he
drank
his
fill
with
unconcern
as
though
he
lived
in
the
forest
primeval
then
he
proudly
raised
his
antlered
head
and
stood
a
moment
sniffing
the
air
bang
rang
out
a
shot
whizzing
close
to
my
ear
and
bang
came
the
echo
from
the
cliff
the
young
buck
stood
a
moment
as
though
sculptured
and
not
until
the
echo
answered
did
he
drop
it
almost
seemed
that
the
echo
had
been
the
good
shot
that
had
laid
low
this
possible
future
leader
of
herds
oh
the
pity
of
it
the
pity
of
it
my
heart
cried
out
turning
i
saw
my
friends
on
a
ledge
of
rock
farther
down
the
river
dum
with
her
smoking
gun
still
raised
to
her
shoulder
an
exalted
look
on
her
face
and
her
black
hair
with
the
coppery
lights
tumbling
all
about
her
an
amazon
indeed
dee
crumpled
up
in
a
little
heap
her
hands
over
her
face
hurrah
shouted
reginald
kent
beside
himself
with
excitement
dee
jumped
up
from
her
crumpled
heap
and
clambered
down
the
cliff
tears
streaming
down
her
face
and
great
sobs
shaking
her
body
she
fortunately
had
on
waterproof
boots
because
she
thought
no
more
of
water
than
she
did
of
land
she
splashed
right
across
the
shallow
ford
and
kneeling
down
by
the
poor
deer
she
buried
her
face
on
his
twitching
shoulder
just
then
the
skiff
with
tucker
father
and
jo
winn
came
round
a
bend
in
the
river
hello
what
this
called
tucker
in
some
alarm
seeing
his
daughter
kneeling
on
the
sand
by
an
expiring
stag
where
dum
happened
it
just
dee
deedling
called
out
dum
i
shot
the
deer
and
now
dee
breaking
her
heart
o
h
o
h
but
he
recognized
me
just
before
he
died
sobbed
dee
i
could
tell
by
the
way
he
looked
at
me
it
was
a
good
thing
he
did
you
grinned
jo
winn
if
he
had
not
he
might
have
gored
you
an
injured
buck
is
a
right
dangerous
thing
to
fool
with
we
comforted
dee
as
best
we
could
and
praised
dum
for
her
shot
soon
we
were
gathered
around
our
campfire
and
then
uncle
peter
and
i
came
in
for
our
share
of
praise
for
the
good
dinner
we
had
cooked
we
feast
on
venison
said
father
ah
never
shuddered
dee
i
could
not
after
he
recognized
me
maybe
molly
cottontail
whose
hind
leg
you
seem
to
be
enjoying
so
would
have
recognized
you
too
if
she
had
ever
seen
you
before
teased
tucker
now
miss
page
here
has
such
a
tender
heart
she
ca
eat
rabbit
that
she
has
seen
running
in
the
woods
but
contents
herself
with
bacon
have
you
no
pity
then
for
the
poor
faithful
hogs
asked
father
they
no
doubt
enjoy
life
as
much
as
the
deer
or
rabbit
that
is
perhaps
bacon
from
one
of
old
sally
offspring
and
page
you
used
to
play
with
those
pigs
when
they
were
little
as
though
they
were
kittens
i
have
no
doubt
all
of
the
litter
would
recognize
you
when
we
begin
to
sentimentalize
about
our
food
we
had
better
our
mouths
and
shut
our
eyes
as
there
is
no
telling
to
what
lengths
it
may
lead
us
but
doctor
you
know
is
pigs
broke
in
tucker
and
the
discussion
ended
with
a
laugh
after
dinner
the
gentlemen
made
another
excursion
across
the
river
but
came
back
without
having
seen
even
a
deer
track
they
got
a
few
partridges
however
and
some
rabbits
and
were
content
we
started
home
through
the
pine
forest
a
very
happy
merry
party
reginald
kent
stuck
closer
than
a
brother
to
dum
side
and
tucker
who
was
walking
with
me
and
i
overheard
this
conversation
between
the
infatuated
young
new
yorker
and
the
ingenuous
dum
do
you
know
miss
dum
you
looked
like
diana
when
you
stood
on
that
rock
and
aimed
at
the
deer
i
wanted
to
paint
you
awfully
bad
and
did
click
the
camera
on
you
i
hope
you
do
mind
oh
no
i
do
mind
if
it
will
help
you
any
in
your
advertising
are
you
going
to
put
me
in
the
ad
too
oh
now
miss
dum
quit
your
kidding
you
know
i
did
mean
i
wanted
to
paint
you
for
advertising
i
meant
for
myself
and
then
dum
blushed
tucker
frowned
he
evidently
did
not
relish
his
girls
getting
old
enough
to
be
talked
to
that
way
miss
dum
will
you
do
me
a
great
favor
continued
kent
i
want
more
than
anything
in
the
world
a
lock
of
your
hair
it
is
the
most
wonderful
hair
i
have
ever
seen
sometimes
it
looks
black
and
then
in
another
light
it
is
almost
red
when
it
came
down
while
you
were
aiming
at
the
deer
it
was
like
copper
in
the
sun
please
give
me
just
a
little
lock
to
take
back
to
new
york
with
me
i
am
afraid
zebedee
would
not
like
for
me
to
cut
my
hair
answered
dum
primly
but
i
tell
you
she
added
generously
i
can
save
you
the
combings
if
you
would
like
them
reginald
kent
looked
rather
nonplused
and
tucker
handed
me
his
gun
to
hold
while
he
rolled
in
the
leaves
for
very
joy
as
we
were
bringing
up
the
rear
nobody
saw
this
pantomime
but
me
and
i
was
as
glad
as
dum
father
that
she
was
not
going
to
be
grown
up
for
a
while
yet
kent
was
to
go
back
to
new
york
on
the
following
day
in
a
little
more
than
a
week
dum
would
be
in
boarding
school
and
it
would
of
necessity
be
many
a
day
before
the
two
could
meet
again
perhaps
the
next
time
they
do
meet
dum
will
have
grown
to
the
age
when
she
will
know
that
to
offer
a
young
man
combings
in
lieu
of
a
lock
is
not
conducive
to
romance
chapter
xix
a
visit
to
richmond
those
were
certainly
three
mad
merry
days
i
spent
in
richmond
with
the
tuckers
poor
father
had
to
go
to
cousin
park
garnett
and
he
just
hated
it
but
he
had
promised
her
that
the
first
time
he
went
to
richmond
he
would
stay
at
her
house
and
stay
he
had
to
the
tuckers
met
us
at
the
station
in
little
henry
ford
it
had
been
only
a
few
days
since
they
had
been
with
us
at
bracken
but
we
had
much
to
talk
about
and
a
great
deal
of
news
to
exchange
father
is
having
the
deer
skin
tanned
to
make
a
rug
for
our
room
at
gresham
and
the
antlers
are
to
be
mounted
for
a
exclaimed
dum
sally
winn
tried
to
die
last
night
and
i
drove
over
to
milton
with
father
and
jo
told
me
he
thought
you
dee
were
the
most
sensible
lady
he
had
ever
met
i
managed
to
get
in
he
promised
me
a
pointer
pup
i
hope
he
wo
forget
it
brindle
had
a
fight
yesterday
and
is
all
bunged
up
from
it
i
know
you
are
dying
to
meet
brindle
said
dee
no
doubt
she
is
pining
away
for
that
honor
teased
tucker
but
do
you
think
she
could
wait
until
after
luncheon
how
about
it
miss
page
well
if
brindle
can
stand
it
i
fancy
i
can
said
i
and
so
we
went
to
a
delightful
restaurant
where
we
had
a
scrumptious
luncheon
i
know
no
other
word
to
express
it
lynhaven
oysters
on
the
deep
shell
hampton
spots
so
beautifully
cooked
that
it
must
have
made
them
glad
to
be
caught
and
fried
shoestring
potatoes
vying
with
the
fish
in
charm
waldorf
salad
with
everything
in
it
but
the
kitchen
stove
as
dee
declared
cousin
park
was
not
expecting
father
until
the
afternoon
so
he
was
spared
to
us
for
a
little
while
much
to
his
delight
and
ours
now
what
shall
we
have
for
dessert
asked
our
genial
host
tweedles
always
wants
pie
cocoanut
as
a
rule
pink
ice
cream
for
me
said
father
did
you
ever
see
a
country
jake
that
did
want
pink
ice
cream
as
soon
as
he
hit
the
city
what
seasoning
laughed
tucker
i
do
care
just
so
it
pink
i
believe
i
have
what
father
has
i
like
it
pink
too
well
cocoanut
pie
for
mine
ordered
dum
and
lemon
meringue
for
mine
ordered
dee
you
are
not
like
the
young
man
who
never
ate
lemon
meringue
pie
because
it
messed
up
his
ears
so
are
you
dee
said
tucker
and
so
our
gay
little
luncheon
proceeded
my
how
i
hate
to
go
to
cousin
park
sighed
father
she
is
kind
in
a
way
but
so
so
ponderous
poor
father
and
i
patted
his
knee
under
the
table
i
do
wish
you
did
have
to
go
well
i
have
plenty
of
engagements
that
will
keep
me
busy
and
i
have
to
do
much
more
than
eat
and
sleep
there
but
it
is
her
long
formal
dinners
that
bore
me
so
well
you
have
simply
got
to
have
dinner
with
us
saturday
evening
at
the
country
club
and
no
doubt
these
girls
will
have
you
before
the
evening
is
over
and
tucker
would
not
take
no
for
an
answer
not
that
father
was
very
persistent
in
his
refusal
we
dropped
the
dear
man
at
cousin
park
great
dark
house
and
he
had
the
look
of
give
up
all
hope
ye
who
enter
here
the
tuckers
had
a
very
attractive
apartment
in
a
large
new
building
but
i
could
fancy
the
havoc
that
dum
and
dee
caused
whenever
they
resorted
to
the
gloves
to
settle
their
disputes
the
place
was
so
full
of
nicknacks
that
one
could
hardly
turn
around
there
were
really
enough
of
what
mammy
susan
called
doodads
to
decorate
a
mansion
and
all
of
these
things
were
crowded
into
a
not
very
large
apartment
some
of
the
things
were
very
beautiful
and
all
of
them
were
interesting
but
if
they
belonged
to
me
i
would
pack
about
half
of
them
away
in
storage
i
thought
of
a
colored
woman
in
the
country
who
lived
in
a
very
small
cabin
with
six
little
children
falling
over
her
feet
all
the
time
and
she
used
to
pray
fervently
oh
gawd
gim
me
grace
not
ter
git
so
pestered
dat
i
throw
ary
one
er
dem
out
do
i
am
afraid
i
would
have
been
so
pestered
with
all
of
the
doodads
that
i
would
surely
have
thrown
some
of
them
outdoors
miss
page
i
have
been
trying
to
persuade
tweedles
to
help
me
to
get
rid
of
some
of
the
mess
in
these
rooms
said
tucker
almost
as
though
he
had
read
my
mind
i
feel
the
stuffiness
of
it
even
more
since
our
visit
at
bracken
that
was
it
the
simplicity
of
bracken
had
spoiled
me
for
overcrowded
rooms
but
zebedee
everything
we
want
to
get
rid
of
is
just
the
thing
you
think
most
of
and
the
things
that
you
think
superfluous
are
our
special
treasures
complained
dum
well
i
am
afraid
we
have
to
wait
until
you
get
some
kind
of
education
and
then
if
stocks
is
riz
we
move
into
a
house
big
enough
to
spread
out
in
their
rugs
were
beautiful
and
their
pictures
i
have
since
found
out
were
very
fine
at
that
time
however
they
did
not
seem
very
good
to
me
the
taste
in
art
of
a
girl
who
has
seen
next
to
no
pictures
is
not
to
be
relied
upon
and
no
doubt
my
taste
was
abominable
brindle
took
me
to
his
heart
and
made
me
perfectly
at
home
he
was
a
brindle
bull
with
undershot
jaw
and
eyes
like
damson
jam
dee
loved
him
next
to
zebedee
and
dum
and
i
know
cried
herself
to
sleep
many
a
night
at
boarding
school
longing
for
her
pet
he
was
certainly
a
very
human
person
or
rather
dog
i
should
say
and
ruled
the
tuckers
with
a
rod
of
iron
he
actually
made
tucker
get
out
of
a
chair
that
he
brindle
had
taken
a
fancy
to
and
he
curled
himself
up
on
the
seat
with
a
haughty
sniff
that
made
us
scream
with
laughter
until
dee
insisted
that
we
control
our
merriment
as
brindle
did
not
like
to
be
laughed
at
it
is
his
one
fault
she
said
he
has
not
a
very
keen
sense
of
humor
he
has
one
other
dee
said
tucker
he
does
smell
like
a
dog
you
must
admit
dee
had
to
admit
it
but
declared
she
thought
a
dog
should
smell
like
a
dog
and
not
like
a
tuberose
so
the
discussion
ended
we
took
in
the
movies
that
afternoon
i
do
know
how
many
of
them
but
it
was
great
fun
zebedee
wo
usually
let
us
go
without
him
said
dee
but
he
thinks
you
are
dignified
enough
to
hold
us
down
me
dignified
why
father
thinks
i
am
as
wild
as
a
march
hare
well
zebedee
says
you
know
when
to
be
quiet
zebedee
likes
you
a
lot
page
declared
dum
if
you
were
exactly
what
you
are
dee
and
i
would
be
awfully
jealous
of
you
what
you
blushing
about
such
a
compliment
would
make
an
old
pair
of
leather
saddle
bags
blush
and
a
girl
of
my
thin
skin
naturally
took
on
a
rosy
hue
that
dee
declared
put
me
out
of
the
chaperone
class
that
evening
we
went
to
a
vaudeville
performance
tucker
newspaper
connection
gave
him
the
anywhere
in
the
house
so
we
were
very
grand
in
box
seats
a
particularly
amusing
artist
was
giving
a
when
dee
exclaimed
look
up
there
in
the
balcony
and
what
should
we
see
but
father
dear
old
lean
solemn
face
convulsed
with
merriment
zebedee
i
mean
tucker
went
up
and
made
him
join
us
how
did
you
escape
cousin
park
i
asked
oh
she
thinks
i
am
in
solemn
conclave
with
some
of
my
professional
brethren
i
did
exactly
tell
a
lie
but
i
acted
one
it
was
either
that
or
burst
a
blood
vessel
you
know
my
cousin
park
do
you
not
mr
tucker
i
know
her
but
she
never
seems
to
know
me
with
garnett
one
must
have
either
plenty
of
very
blue
blood
or
more
than
plenty
of
very
yellow
gold
i
got
blue
blood
to
burn
but
no
yellow
gold
as
you
know
there
must
be
something
radically
wrong
with
me
in
her
eyes
what
it
is
i
do
know
nor
do
i
much
care
i
was
very
fond
of
her
husband
major
peyton
garnett
was
a
good
friend
to
me
i
admired
him
immensely
yes
the
major
was
a
fine
old
gentleman
said
father
he
afterward
told
me
that
one
reason
he
had
to
escape
from
cousin
park
presence
or
break
a
blood
vessel
was
that
she
had
so
many
unkind
things
to
say
of
jeffry
tucker
the
old
croaker
that
she
was
i
am
sorry
for
you
page
but
you
are
in
for
a
sunday
dinner
at
cousin
park
i
groaned
in
agonized
anticipation
i
could
get
out
of
it
for
you
my
child
she
made
such
a
point
of
it
she
is
our
kinswoman
and
we
have
to
show
her
some
respect
well
thank
goodness
this
time
i
do
have
to
go
to
the
dentist
too
the
combination
of
cousin
park
and
the
dentist
is
a
strong
one
i
can
tell
you
if
you
can
stand
her
father
i
reckon
i
can
that
my
good
girl
said
father
patting
my
shoulder
and
tucker
gave
me
a
warm
and
friendly
glance
and
said
tweedles
and
i
will
see
that
you
get
there
late
and
come
away
early
it
seems
to
me
i
laughed
more
at
that
vaudeville
performance
than
anybody
in
the
theater
i
had
seen
very
few
shows
in
my
life
and
everything
was
new
and
fresh
to
me
i
was
not
bored
even
by
the
strong
man
who
seemed
to
be
so
tiresome
to
the
audience
and
no
joke
was
too
much
of
a
chestnut
to
be
scorned
by
me
to
have
father
with
us
too
made
my
cup
of
happiness
full
to
the
brim
the
next
evening
saturday
we
had
dinner
at
the
country
club
and
stayed
for
the
dance
afterward
the
country
club
was
a
beautiful
building
with
spacious
grounds
golf
links
tennis
courts
and
a
view
of
the
james
river
that
appealed
to
me
very
much
the
dinner
was
fine
and
father
and
i
had
a
splendid
time
i
am
glad
to
escape
all
the
meals
i
can
at
the
apartment
house
café
confessed
tucker
when
tweedles
are
away
i
eat
anywhere
but
at
home
you
are
an
extravagant
piece
said
dee
but
i
have
my
regular
meals
served
for
brindle
laughed
tucker
oh
that
alters
the
case
then
exclaimed
dee
brindle
should
have
just
as
good
food
as
people
with
a
variety
of
vegetables
what
a
ballroom
floor
they
had
at
that
clubhouse
i
had
never
danced
as
i
said
before
until
i
went
to
school
but
i
had
been
an
apt
pupil
because
i
was
such
an
eager
one
and
now
knew
enough
of
the
modern
dances
to
get
along
very
well
i
had
never
in
my
life
danced
with
a
man
at
school
we
took
turns
guiding
and
i
was
much
sought
after
because
of
my
being
so
untiring
miss
page
you
are
the
guest
of
honor
and
i
am
the
host
so
it
is
in
order
that
you
give
me
this
first
dance
and
jeffry
tucker
bowed
in
front
of
me
as
though
i
were
a
great
society
belle
the
tuckers
were
all
born
dancers
and
as
i
glided
away
with
tucker
i
remembered
what
miss
jane
cox
had
said
about
his
leading
the
germans
at
the
university
with
his
little
sweetheart
virginia
afterward
his
wife
a
great
wave
of
pity
for
the
poor
little
dead
wife
swept
over
me
and
i
came
very
near
missing
step
in
a
rather
intricate
dance
we
were
attempting
it
must
have
been
so
sad
to
die
and
leave
such
a
delightful
husband
and
the
twins
who
were
such
charming
girls
that
they
must
have
been
cunning
little
babies
what
a
vigorous
presence
was
jeffry
tucker
he
must
have
been
a
lover
that
any
girl
would
have
been
happy
with
i
hoped
if
i
ever
did
have
a
lover
that
he
would
be
the
kind
that
i
fancied
tucker
must
have
been
something
made
me
blush
as
my
thoughts
dwelt
on
my
ever
having
a
lover
my
what
a
color
dancing
gives
you
exclaimed
my
partner
a
minute
ago
you
looked
so
sad
i
wondered
what
you
were
thinking
of
and
now
you
are
as
rosy
as
the
dawn
is
darkest
just
before
dawn
you
know
i
answered
i
wondered
what
he
would
have
said
had
he
known
what
i
was
thinking
of
when
i
looked
so
sad
and
then
a
strange
thing
happened
and
the
kind
of
thing
has
happened
very
often
in
my
life
when
i
have
been
with
tucker
he
took
up
my
thoughts
almost
as
though
he
had
read
them
and
said
i
was
thinking
of
my
little
girl
wife
virginia
i
so
often
think
of
her
when
i
dance
she
and
i
danced
our
youth
away
she
was
a
wonderful
dancer
she
had
the
same
smooth
glide
that
you
have
i
hate
a
hoppy
dancer
and
with
his
usual
disregard
of
appearances
he
wiped
his
eyes
in
which
the
big
tears
had
gathered
i
did
feel
so
sorry
for
him
i
actually
had
the
hardihood
to
pat
him
on
the
shoulder
where
my
left
hand
rested
but
i
could
not
say
anything
to
him
i
felt
so
choky
the
sun
came
out
in
a
very
few
moments
however
and
he
smiled
into
my
eyes
and
we
finished
the
dance
without
ever
losing
a
step
i
know
jeffry
tucker
is
the
only
person
in
the
world
who
could
cry
and
dance
at
the
same
time
his
tears
were
sincere
too
quite
as
sincere
as
his
dancing
and
he
certainly
put
his
whole
soul
into
every
step
he
took
miss
page
you
have
been
mighty
good
to
tweedles
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
for
it
he
said
as
the
music
stopped
and
left
us
stranded
across
the
ballroom
from
father
and
the
twins
also
who
had
been
dancing
with
some
college
boys
home
for
the
holidays
me
good
to
them
why
they
are
good
to
me
as
good
as
gold
oh
i
know
what
you
have
done
for
them
they
control
themselves
so
much
better
than
they
used
to
and
are
so
much
more
considerate
in
every
way
i
see
your
influence
at
every
turn
they
have
had
a
fight
since
they
came
home
and
actually
listen
when
i
talk
whether
i
have
anything
to
say
or
not
i
had
to
laugh
at
this
i
had
really
made
the
girls
come
to
their
senses
about
fighting
when
they
disagreed
even
with
gloves
on
it
was
a
very
boisterous
way
of
settling
disputes
and
we
had
a
rule
at
carter
hall
instituted
by
me
that
a
fine
of
one
penny
was
imposed
when
any
of
us
interrupted
unless
the
speaker
had
had
the
floor
out
of
all
reason
we
found
the
girls
enthusiastic
over
the
dancing
and
father
having
as
good
a
time
as
any
of
us
it
was
his
first
experience
in
seeing
the
much
written
and
new
dances
and
he
was
greatly
interested
why
daughter
you
dance
beautifully
he
said
fondly
as
i
squeezed
in
by
him
if
you
have
learned
as
much
latin
and
french
at
gresham
as
you
have
dancing
you
will
be
a
young
woman
well
i
ca
promise
that
i
laughed
but
i
know
how
to
conjugate
dance
both
in
latin
and
french
well
to
be
able
to
conjugate
as
well
as
dance
means
you
are
becoming
very
erudite
that
is
a
very
pretty
step
that
dum
has
been
taking
is
that
the
it
looks
easy
too
it
is
easy
doctor
allison
answered
dum
and
now
they
are
going
to
dance
it
again
come
on
and
try
and
to
the
delight
and
astonishment
of
all
of
us
father
was
on
the
floor
with
dum
with
a
precision
that
made
us
know
he
had
been
watching
the
dancers
very
carefully
and
had
been
mentally
dancing
for
some
time
i
know
he
had
not
danced
for
at
least
sixteen
years
but
like
miss
jane
cox
once
a
dancer
always
a
dancer
this
is
more
fun
than
gresham
whispered
dee
to
me
when
we
stopped
to
rest
a
minute
between
dances
the
college
students
had
been
very
attentive
and
the
twins
and
i
had
danced
every
dance
who
should
come
rushing
up
to
us
at
this
moment
but
mabel
binks
she
embraced
us
noisily
and
one
would
have
thought
we
were
her
sisters
we
were
coldly
polite
but
she
overlooked
our
want
of
cordiality
and
fastened
herself
on
to
us
there
was
nothing
for
us
but
to
introduce
her
to
father
and
tucker
and
the
young
men
who
had
been
dancing
attendance
on
us
that
was
what
she
wanted
and
the
dead
set
she
made
at
tucker
showed
what
she
considered
big
game
the
festive
mabel
who
lived
in
newport
news
was
stopping
in
richmond
for
a
few
days
on
her
way
back
to
gresham
she
was
visiting
an
old
cousin
who
she
volubly
explained
was
too
selfish
to
do
anything
for
her
pleasure
she
had
with
difficulty
persuaded
her
to
bring
her
to
the
country
club
and
now
they
were
there
the
cousin
either
would
or
could
introduce
her
to
any
men
i
can
just
shift
for
myself
i
let
her
know
the
dashing
girl
exclaimed
the
wall
is
not
meant
for
me
to
hold
up
and
if
no
one
will
ask
me
to
dance
i
get
out
and
do
a
i
should
like
to
see
that
but
first
will
you
do
me
the
extreme
honor
to
dance
this
with
me
said
tucker
with
mock
grandiloquence
gushed
mabel
and
was
soon
engaged
in
a
boisterous
hopping
match
with
tucker
i
could
kill
zebedee
said
dum
through
clenched
teeth
i
believe
that
binks
thing
came
through
richmond
with
the
hope
of
meeting
him
and
here
he
tumbles
at
the
first
shot
and
goes
off
dancing
with
her
as
though
it
oh
i
ca
talk
about
it
it
makes
me
so
furious
look
how
they
are
romping
too
i
dare
dee
or
me
to
romp
that
way
i
could
but
recall
the
views
tucker
had
so
recently
expressed
to
me
about
dancers
who
hopped
and
here
he
was
jumping
around
like
a
hen
on
a
hot
griddle
and
as
far
as
i
could
see
enjoying
himself
very
much
i
sympathized
with
dum
while
i
did
not
feel
called
upon
to
get
into
a
rage
and
clench
my
teeth
i
was
a
little
disappointed
in
my
kind
host
i
felt
very
young
and
shy
all
of
a
sudden
mabel
as
she
triumphantly
bore
off
the
prize
had
in
a
most
condescending
way
tossed
me
her
handkerchief
and
gloves
with
a
here
child
hold
these
for
me
that
i
would
not
do
the
heavy
smell
of
musk
that
hung
around
all
of
belongings
sickened
me
and
why
should
she
make
a
of
me
anyhow
i
put
them
down
disdainfully
on
a
chair
meeting
with
hearty
approval
by
my
act
and
then
had
a
nice
quiet
dance
with
father
who
proved
to
be
as
good
a
partner
as
one
could
want
chapter
xx
dinner
at
cousin
park
sunday
dawned
and
with
it
the
consciousness
that
i
had
to
go
through
the
ordeal
of
dinner
with
cousin
park
oh
how
i
hated
the
thought
of
it
we
had
slept
late
after
the
unusual
hours
we
had
kept
the
night
before
and
tucker
had
kindly
had
our
breakfast
sent
up
from
the
café
that
to
make
up
for
treating
us
the
way
he
did
last
night
said
dum
buttering
her
cakes
as
she
sat
up
in
bed
treating
us
what
way
inquired
dee
dancing
with
that
binks
abomination
he
knew
he
had
no
business
to
do
it
why
dum
i
said
determined
to
cool
her
down
if
possible
i
really
see
how
tucker
could
have
done
otherwise
a
schoolmate
who
from
all
appearances
is
devoted
to
his
daughters
joins
our
group
and
lets
it
be
known
that
she
is
dying
to
dance
indeed
is
thinking
of
dancing
alone
why
there
was
no
way
for
a
gentleman
to
behave
than
just
exactly
as
zeb
i
mean
tucker
did
behave
i
would
have
been
pleased
if
my
father
had
done
exactly
as
yours
did
and
i
believe
father
would
if
her
innuendos
had
been
addressed
to
him
well
doctor
allison
would
never
have
hopped
as
zebedee
did
what
i
hate
to
think
about
is
the
way
that
girl
is
going
to
tell
all
the
girls
at
school
about
our
handsome
young
father
and
how
he
devoted
himself
to
her
i
bet
she
comes
here
on
some
pretext
or
other
well
i
sic
brindle
on
her
if
she
does
he
ca
stand
cats
hissed
dee
who
was
becoming
worked
up
by
dum
evident
passion
well
i
tell
you
one
thing
the
ruder
you
are
to
mabel
the
more
polite
your
father
will
be
and
the
more
polite
you
are
the
more
indifferent
tucker
will
be
i
admonished
how
did
you
get
so
wise
old
solomon
asked
dum
in
rather
muffled
tones
through
a
mouthful
of
flannel
cakes
why
mammy
susan
says
folks
an
mules
is
moughty
nachally
ef
yer
want
ter
go
ter

ter
spite

all
de
way
ter

mill
well
we
make
out
zebedee
has
got
to
go
to
the
mill
and
he
want
to
stay
in
the
pasture
mabel
binks
is
more
like
a
mill
than
a
pasture
said
dum
rather
taken
with
my
philosophy
yes
and
is
grist
that
comes
to
her
mill
too
declared
dee
i
am
going
to
try
the
plan
on
zebedee
this
minute
and
she
bounced
up
and
donning
slippers
and
kimono
went
in
to
the
living
room
where
tucker
was
deep
in
the
sunday
paper
she
left
the
door
slightly
ajar
and
dum
and
i
could
plainly
hear
the
conversation
good
morning
zebedee
and
the
sound
of
a
hearty
kiss
it
was
awfully
good
of
you
to
have
breakfast
sent
up
to
us
we
did
not
mean
to
oversleep
glad
to
do
it
tweedledeedles
i
thought
all
of
you
would
be
tired
after
tripping
the
light
fantastic
toe
almost
into
sunday
morning
say
zebedee
page
has
to
go
to
her
cousin
park
to
dinner
so
do
you
think
it
would
be
nice
to
have
mabel
binks
to
dinner
with
us
dum
gasped
and
started
to
rush
into
the
sitting
room
without
the
formality
of
a
kimono
but
i
grabbed
her
and
with
a
warning
finger
quieted
her
oh
come
now
dee
i
should
think
you
and
dum
would
be
content
to
spend
your
last
sunday
at
home
quietly
with
your
poor
old
lonesome
zebedee
i
ca
see
what
you
want
with
miss
binks
she
is
much
older
than
you
tweedles
and
not
a
bit
the
kind
of
person
i
should
encourage
you
to
have
as
an
intimate
i
get
the
names
of
your
schoolmates
mixed
but
was
she
the
girl
you
wrote
me
was
so
and
unfeeling
in
her
treatment
of
that
nice
ladylike
little
girl
from
price
landing
ye
s
but
i
thought
you
liked
her
pretty
well
last
night
why
i
never
gave
her
a
thought
she
so
plainly
asked
me
to
dance
with
her
that
i
had
to
do
it
but
that
was
all
she
is
showily
handsome
and
amusing
enough
in
the
daring
way
in
which
she
talks
but
nay
nay
not
for
me
more
sounds
of
kissing
and
then
now
run
on
and
all
of
you
get
dressed
in
a
hurry
so
we
can
take
a
nice
spin
with
henry
ford
and
go
to
church
before
miss
page
has
to
be
delivered
over
to
the
dragon
what
that
smell
zebedee
the
hall
is
reeking
with
a
terrible
odor
asked
dee
sniffing
suspiciously
i
ca
imagine
i
was
afraid
you
and
dum
and
miss
page
had
gone
in
for
musk
the
whole
apartment
is
permeated
with
it
dee
went
out
into
the
little
hall
connecting
the
girls
bedroom
with
the
living
room
and
poked
around
the
hatrack
where
the
odor
seemed
to
be
strongest
here
it
is
she
cried
in
your
overcoat
pocket
oh
that
wretched
girl
gloves
she
asked
me
to
hold
them
for
her
just
before
we
left
the
club
and
i
must
have
put
them
in
my
pocket
hang
outside
the
bathroom
window
that
smell
is
enough
to
make
all
of
us
faint
please
turn
my
pocket
inside
out
so
it
can
air
what
did
i
tell
you
and
dee
burst
into
the
bedroom
waving
the
smelly
gloves
as
she
came
the
minx
made
zebedee
keep
her
gloves
just
so
she
could
get
around
here
we
better
dress
in
a
hurry
so
we
can
be
ready
to
receive
her
she
might
eat
up
poor
zebedee
without
his
knowing
what
got
him
and
she
scornfully
hung
the
offensive
kids
out
the
bathroom
window
mabel
binks
did
come
before
dum
and
i
were
quite
dressed
but
dee
was
installed
in
the
living
room
waiting
for
her
with
brindle
at
her
side
ready
to
sic
on
mabel
if
she
showed
signs
of
walking
off
with
the
handsome
young
father
oh
you
naughty
man
i
am
almost
sure
you
purloined
my
gloves
last
night
we
heard
her
say
in
her
loud
and
strident
tones
i
thought
i
would
stop
in
on
the
way
to
church
to
get
them
yes
he
did
hook
them
from
you
said
dum
making
her
appearance
like
a
whirlwind
zebedee
is
great
on
that
he
steals
girls
gloves
all
the
time
and
gives
them
to
dee
and
me
we
never
have
to
buy
any
all
the
girls
get
him
to
hold
their
gloves
for
them
and
then
he
brings
them
home
to
us
and
we
divide
them
up
here
yours
are
zebedee
did
not
know
whose
they
were
but
we
recognized
the
perfume
you
are
so
fond
of
they
are
too
big
for
us
so
we
were
not
going
to
row
over
them
tucker
sat
dumfounded
during
this
tirade
of
dum
and
as
for
me
i
had
to
dive
back
in
the
room
from
which
i
was
emerging
to
get
my
countenance
straightened
out
dee
buried
her
nose
in
brindle
neck
and
made
such
a
funny
little
noise
trying
to
keep
back
her
laughter
that
brindle
growled
and
wrinkled
up
his
neck
in
a
most
ominous
manner
mabel
took
the
gloves
and
for
once
her
aplomb
deserted
her
she
beat
a
hasty
retreat
with
that
were
scarcely
audible
i
fully
expected
that
tucker
would
admonish
dum
for
the
ridiculous
fabrication
of
which
she
had
been
guilty
but
he
seemed
to
forget
all
about
the
behavior
befitting
a
parent
and
caught
us
by
the
hand
and
in
a
moment
we
were
dancing
the
lobster
quadrille
and
singing
lustily
will
you
wo
you
wo
you
will
you
will
you
join
the
dance
now
hurry
up
and
get
on
your
hats
and
jackets
and
we
will
speed
little
henry
ford
to
church
and
off
we
went
in
a
christian
frame
of
mind
and
at
peace
with
the
whole
world
especially
dum
who
had
scored
heavily
over
the
detested
mabel
the
hour
for
dinner
at
cousin
park
had
at
last
come
how
slowly
i
walked
up
the
broad
stone
steps
leading
to
her
fine
house
the
same
lugubrious
butler
opened
the
door
that
had
performed
that
office
when
i
visited
cousin
park
on
that
other
memorable
occasion
he
had
the
air
of
one
who
is
letting
in
the
mourners
i
involuntarily
glanced
at
the
door
bell
to
see
if
by
any
chance
crêpe
could
be
hanging
from
it
this
butler
appropriate
name
was
jeremiah
and
he
was
what
is
known
as
a
nigger
i
smiled
when
i
greeted
him
and
for
a
moment
he
showed
his
blue
gums
in
a
vain
attempt
at
cheerfulness
but
he
quickly
subsided
into
his
habitual
gloom
i
recalled
what
mammy
susan
had
said
to
me
many
a
time
be
mighty
keerful
honey
don
nebber
cross
a
nigger
fer
de
bite
er
one
is
rank
pizen
and
sho
death
cousin
park
was
seated
in
state
in
her
ugly
handsome
parlor
the
room
was
of
noble
proportions
and
might
have
been
pretty
but
cousin
park
had
happened
to
marry
the
genial
major
at
the
period
when
oiled
walnut
was
the
prevailing
style
and
her
whole
life
had
been
built
on
the
basis
ever
since
her
costly
velvet
carpets
still
came
right
to
the
edge
of
the
floor
and
were
snugly
tacked
close
to
the
baseboard
no
hardwood
floors
and
rugs
for
her
the
heavy
furniture
was
deeply
carved
and
if
the
unwary
visitor
forgot
himself
for
a
moment
and
attempted
to
lounge
in
his
chair
he
was
quickly
brought
to
a
sense
of
propriety
by
a
carved
pineapple
getting
him
between
his
shoulders
or
maybe
a
bunch
of
grapes
striking
him
in
the
small
of
his
back
i
usually
tried
to
sit
on
the
horsehair
sofa
long
practice
in
riding
bareback
had
given
me
a
poise
that
enabled
me
to
be
very
comfortable
seated
thus
without
sliding
off
the
pictures
were
hung
close
up
to
the
ceiling
according
to
the
style
in
vogue
in
times
gone
by
they
were
mostly
dark
portraits
in
heavy
gilt
frames
and
they
glared
down
at
you
as
though
they
resented
your
intrusion
into
their
mausoleum
father
was
seated
forward
in
his
chair
trying
to
avoid
the
pineapple
and
on
his
face
was
an
expression
like
that
of
a
little
boy
who
has
been
taken
to
church
and
fears
every
minute
to
be
questioned
as
to
the
text
i
rather
expected
our
stern
relative
to
tell
him
to
go
wash
his
hands
for
dinner
he
jumped
up
and
hugged
me
enthusiastically
and
i
felt
ashamed
that
i
had
hated
so
to
come
cousin
park
gave
me
an
upholstered
embrace
and
i
made
for
the
horsehair
sofa
that
seemed
friendly
and
yielding
in
comparison
with
cousin
park
well
so
you
have
torn
yourself
away
from
those
tuckers
long
enough
to
do
your
duty
have
you
i
scented
a
battle
from
afar
but
determined
to
be
good
and
not
say
anything
to
make
my
cousin
angry
no
doubt
she
was
hungry
and
would
be
more
agreeable
as
soon
as
dinner
was
announced
it
is
kind
of
you
to
ask
me
to
dinner
cousin
park
and
i
am
glad
to
come
i
meekly
replied
and
thinking
maybe
it
would
be
tactful
to
change
the
subject
i
said
to
father
how
do
you
feel
after
dancing
last
night
fine
daughter
i
never
had
such
a
good
time
in
my
life
cousin
james
you
dancing
you
are
surely
jesting
you
you
a
man
of
your
age
oh
i
not
so
awfully
old
cousin
park
there
were
men
on
the
floor
ten
years
older
than
i
am
bank
presidents
eminent
surgeons
and
several
judges
all
dancing
the
new
dances
with
the
utmost
abandon
well
where
on
earth
did
you
learn
the
new
dances
cousin
james
well
i
never
saw
them
danced
before
so
it
must
have
been
by
a
correspondence
course
and
father
winked
at
me
the
sepulchral
butler
came
in
to
announce
dinner
just
at
this
crucial
moment
when
his
irate
mistress
looked
as
though
she
would
burst
her
tight
black
satin
basque
in
which
she
had
been
so
compactly
hooked
he
quavered
in
a
sad
voice
dinner
is
served
but
his
tone
reminded
me
of
jeremiah
chapter
ix
first
verse
oh
that
my
head
were
waters
and
mine
eyes
a
fountain
of
tears
that
i
might
weep
day
and
night
illustration
dum
looked
at
me
aghast
page
you
here
and
dee
the
dining
room
was
one
degree
more
cheerful
than
the
parlor
as
instead
of
the
portraits
there
were
audubon
prints
and
the
marriage
of
pocahontas
a
heavy
walnut
sideboard
laden
with
massive
silver
almost
filled
one
side
of
the
room
the
table
was
precisely
set
and
the
food
may
have
been
good
but
everything
was
so
ponderous
including
the
hostess
that
when
we
got
through
with
the
long
tiresome
courses
i
felt
like
the
old
wolf
that
mammy
susan
used
to
tell
about
he
swallowed
seven
little
kids
whole
and
then
while
he
slept
by
the
water
edge
the
widow
goat
came
and
ripped
him
open
took
out
the
dear
little
kids
and
put
in
their
place
seven
huge
stones
the
old
wolf
was
naturally
thirsty
after
this
surgical
operation
and
so
was
i
when
i
had
packed
in
and
hammered
down
roast
chicken
boiled
hominy
mashed
potatoes
baked
rice
macaroni
and
i
do
know
what
besides
except
that
we
topped
off
with
a
plum
pudding
that
was
the
last
straw
i
longed
for
sleep
with
an
intensity
that
was
truly
painful
and
i
could
see
that
poor
dear
father
was
desperate
the
conversation
at
the
table
was
as
heavy
and
starchy
as
the
food
father
and
i
could
not
help
comparing
it
to
the
gay
little
dinner
we
had
enjoyed
the
night
before
at
the
country
club
cousin
park
manner
was
always
dictatorial
even
when
she
was
the
visitor
instead
of
the
hostess
and
on
that
day
she
seemed
to
think
she
was
born
to
boss
the
universe
she
picked
on
me
most
of
the
time
and
i
let
her
do
it
knowing
father
must
have
had
his
share
of
correction
but
when
she
began
on
my
friends
the
darling
tuckers
i
got
a
little
restive
mammy
susan
always
told
me
do
sass
old
folks
till
dey
fust
sass
you
and
i
began
to
feel
that
old
folks
were
sassing
me
considerably
i
smiled
to
myself
remembering
that
tucker
had
told
me
that
when
the
major
died
at
his
funeral
they
sang
peace
perfect
peace
and
the
pall
bearers
themselves
could
hardly
keep
from
grinning
to
think
what
a
far
from
peaceful
time
the
poor
major
had
had
on
earth
father
came
to
my
rescue
when
our
masterful
cousin
finally
sprung
this
mine
on
us
i
am
astonished
cousin
james
that
you
should
have
no
more
sense
of
propriety
than
to
let
page
visit
that
jeffry
tucker
without
a
chaperon
why
cousin
park
you
astonish
me
page
is
visiting
daughters
her
schoolmates
they
are
all
three
very
young
to
have
a
question
of
propriety
brought
up
i
do
care
a
woman
is
never
too
young
or
too
old
to
be
made
the
subject
of
gossip
and
cousin
park
creaked
ominously
well
that
being
the
case
i
think
it
is
highly
improper
and
imprudent
for
me
to
be
visiting
you
unless
we
can
look
upon
jeremiah
as
a
chaperon
and
cousin
park
knowing
herself
to
be
worsted
sighed
a
great
heaving
sigh
and
looked
sadly
at
the
major
portrait
as
though
if
he
had
been
alive
he
would
have
protected
her
how
glad
we
were
to
hear
the
toot
of
henry
ford
and
to
know
that
our
time
in
purgatory
was
over
the
fresh
air
took
away
that
awful
drowsiness
and
the
cheerful
talk
of
the
tuckers
as
we
spun
out
into
the
country
made
us
forget
the
deadly
conversation
we
had
been
forced
to
be
a
party
to
father
had
an
engagement
for
supper
with
a
medical
brother
and
he
was
to
go
back
to
bracken
the
next
day
blood
may
be
thicker
than
water
he
said
in
fact
it
was
so
thick
you
could
stir
it
but
never
again
do
i
intend
to
make
a
visit
at
cousin
park
garnett
why
i
feel
as
though
that
nigger
had
bitten
me
chapter
xxi
the
desperation
of
dum
back
at
gresham
and
trying
to
get
into
harness
some
of
us
kicked
over
the
traces
feeling
our
oats
as
it
were
and
dum
got
the
bit
between
her
teeth
and
came
very
near
running
all
the
way
home
before
we
could
stop
her
it
was
hard
to
get
into
what
mantilini
calls
the
demnition
grind
after
three
weeks
of
untrammeled
freedom
the
whole
school
seemed
restive
and
the
teachers
were
not
much
better
than
the
pupils
miss
peyton
had
to
drive
her
coach
very
carefully
her
infinite
tact
showed
itself
constantly
a
word
of
warning
here
a
slight
tightening
of
the
reins
there
just
a
little
tap
to
the
ones
who
seemed
inclined
to
laziness
and
soon
we
were
trotting
along
the
road
of
knowledge
just
as
though
we
had
not
been
kicking
up
our
heels
in
the
green
pastures
all
but
dum
she
could
not
get
back
to
work
if
the
year
were
only
half
over
but
it
only
the
middle
of
january
now
we
got
months
and
months
to
wait
before
we
see
zebedee
again
when
we
once
get
into
february
i
can
stand
it
better
i
ca
and
study
and
as
for
demerits
let
give
me
all
they
want
to
let
put
me
in
bounds
i
do
want
to
go
off
of
the
old
place
what
fun
is
it
to
walk
down
into
that
dinky
little
village
keeping
step
like
convicts
i
rather
have
striped
clothes
like
convicts
than
these
old
stupid
blue
things
there
is
some
variety
in
stripes
but
this
eternal
and
everlasting
dark
blue
ugh
i
hate
it
but
dum
i
expostulated
if
you
get
so
many
demerits
you
will
not
only
be
in
bounds
but
you
have
to
write
pages
and
pages
of
dictionary
i
see
make
me
can
lead
a
horse
to
water
but
you
can
not
make
him
drink
they
can
tell
me
to
write
the
dictionary
all
they
want
to
but
i
yet
to
see
the
man
woman
or
child
who
can
make
me
write
anything
i
just
wo
and
that
an
end
of
it
but
what
will
your
father
think
i
asked
hoping
to
get
on
her
better
side
by
appealing
to
her
love
for
her
adored
zebedee
think
can
think
like
young
niggers
think
buckeyes
is
biscuit
this
made
me
roar
as
it
was
a
saying
i
had
told
the
twins
that
mammy
susan
had
taught
me
when
i
was
a
child
there
was
no
persuading
the
headstrong
dum
she
had
the
bit
between
her
teeth
and
she
was
rushing
straight
to
destruction
she
got
zero
in
her
classes
during
the
day
and
that
night
in
study
hall
she
spent
the
time
making
cunning
little
brownies
out
of
the
colored
clay
she
had
brought
in
her
pocket
she
did
not
open
a
book
except
for
the
purpose
of
propping
it
up
on
her
desk
to
conceal
the
little
lifelike
figures
she
was
so
busy
modeling
dee
gazed
at
her
with
an
agonized
expression
on
her
face
and
i
gave
her
many
an
appealing
glance
but
she
merely
made
a
face
at
me
and
went
on
with
her
sculpture
where
was
it
to
end
zero
for
that
day
lessons
and
many
preceding
days
and
not
a
single
one
prepared
for
next
day
she
seemed
perfectly
careless
of
the
teacher
who
was
keeping
study
hall
as
though
she
invited
reproval
but
it
so
happened
that
miss
sears
who
was
on
duty
that
night
did
not
seem
to
notice
dum
behavior
when
the
study
hall
was
over
the
reckless
girl
picked
up
all
her
brownies
and
carried
them
carefully
on
her
open
book
up
to
her
room
right
under
miss
sears
nose
she
must
be
crazy
whispered
dee
to
me
and
miss
sears
must
be
in
love
or
blind
or
something
she
did
see
how
dum
was
cutting
up
well
dum
was
certainly
reckless
i
thought
every
minute
she
was
going
to
be
called
down
you
got
to
be
either
good
or
careful
and
dum
was
certainly
neither
miss
sears
beckoned
to
me
and
i
fell
back
and
the
tuckers
went
on
to
page
said
miss
sears
miss
peyton
is
rather
worried
over
virginia
tucker
of
course
i
saw
how
she
was
conducting
herself
during
study
hall
but
miss
peyton
has
decided
the
best
way
to
get
hold
of
dum
is
to
let
her
alone
for
a
while
the
rest
of
the
school
is
back
in
working
order
but
she
is
as
wild
as
a
deer
miss
peyton
asked
me
to
take
you
into
our
confidence
and
see
if
you
can
help
us
some
will
you
keep
a
pretty
sharp
eye
on
dum
you
mean
tell
on
her
if
she
gets
into
scrapes
i
asked
flushing
painfully
my
dear
girl
no
you
would
not
be
the
kind
we
would
go
to
if
we
wanted
an
informer
we
want
you
to
try
to
influence
dum
to
quiet
down
and
let
her
realize
that
she
must
get
to
work
demerits
seem
to
have
no
effect
on
her
i
verily
believe
she
enjoys
getting
as
many
as
she
can
you
have
lots
of
influence
with
those
girls
and
i
believe
a
talk
from
you
would
do
her
more
good
than
being
brought
up
before
the
faculty
and
miss
sears
looked
at
me
very
kindly
well
i
do
my
best
but
i
ca
promise
that
dum
will
listen
to
me
i
did
not
like
to
say
that
i
had
already
done
what
i
could
but
i
determined
to
try
try
again
dum
had
her
brownies
ranged
in
a
line
on
the
bureau
and
under
each
she
had
tucked
one
of
her
visiting
cards
on
which
she
had
written
something
dee
looked
sad
and
dum
defiant
i
was
just
telling
dum
began
dee
never
mind
what
you
were
telling
dum
interrupted
the
outrageous
girl
it
none
of
your
business
nor
is
it
page
allison
if
i
get
into
scrapes
i
reckon
i
old
enough
to
take
care
of
myself
without
the
assistance
of
persons
no
older
nor
wiser
than
i
am
so
you
are
but
you
owe
a
penny
for
interrupting
dee
cents
since
the
holidays
i
said
sternly
i
do
care
if
i
do
i
do
intend
to
pay
it
i
need
my
money
for
other
things
besides
this
foolishness
i
looked
at
dum
in
amazement
she
and
dee
often
were
rude
to
each
other
but
in
the
three
months
that
i
had
known
them
neither
one
of
them
had
been
anything
but
scrupulously
polite
to
me
i
realized
that
silence
would
be
the
better
part
of
valor
in
this
encounter
so
i
prepared
for
bed
without
saying
a
word
i
gave
a
warning
glance
at
dee
and
she
ever
tactful
held
her
peace
dum
was
evidently
disappointed
as
she
was
simply
for
a
fight
we
got
to
bed
as
lights
out
bell
rang
and
in
a
moment
everything
was
perfectly
quiet
i
did
not
go
to
sleep
immediately
but
pondered
over
what
miss
sears
had
said
how
can
i
best
help
dum
i
asked
myself
i
must
keep
an
eye
on
her
and
still
not
let
her
know
it
it
was
hard
to
take
her
rudeness
without
giving
her
as
good
as
she
sent
but
i
felt
that
a
real
loss
of
temper
on
my
part
would
mean
an
equal
loss
of
influence
i
dropped
off
to
sleep
with
dum
on
my
mind
it
must
have
been
a
little
after
midnight
when
i
awakened
and
something
prompted
me
to
glance
at
dum
bed
it
was
a
bright
night
the
moon
not
full
but
big
enough
to
make
everything
in
the
room
visible
a
light
snow
was
on
the
ground
which
aided
the
lighting
powers
of
the
moon
by
reflection
dum
bed
was
empty
her
nightgown
was
on
the
floor
and
her
clothes
which
i
had
seen
her
throw
on
the
chair
near
her
bed
were
gone
i
got
up
in
an
excitement
that
made
my
heart
go
like
a
trip
hammer
and
found
her
hat
and
jacket
gone
too
dee
dee
i
said
in
as
quiet
a
voice
as
i
could
command
dum
is
gone
gone
gone
where
said
poor
sleepy
dee
i
do
know
but
it
is
up
to
us
to
find
out
get
into
your
clothes
as
fast
as
you
can
i
do
believe
she
has
been
gone
long
her
bed
is
so
warm
i
had
felt
it
as
soon
as
i
jumped
out
of
mine
dee
shuddered
at
this
announcement
of
mine
she
said
afterward
it
sounded
like
the
report
of
a
coroner
inquest
fire
engine
horses
could
not
have
sprung
into
their
harness
quicker
than
dee
and
i
did
into
our
clothes
in
a
twinkling
we
were
wrapped
in
our
warm
sweaters
and
had
donned
hats
and
rubbers
the
last
not
only
because
of
the
snow
but
to
deaden
our
footsteps
down
the
long
corridors
i
got
ready
a
moment
sooner
than
dee
and
i
struck
a
match
and
read
one
of
the
cards
dum
had
stuck
under
the
little
clay
brownies
to
miss
peyton
as
a
parting
token
of
appreciation
of
her
discipline
i
gasped
with
astonishment
dum
was
crazy
surely
perfectly
daft
what
is
on
the
card
asked
dee
anxiously
oh
just
some
of
dum
nonsense
hurry
i
did
not
think
i
had
better
tell
dee
it
sounded
like
a
last
farewell
we
found
the
front
door
unlocked
she
had
certainly
gone
out
recently
as
the
watchman
made
his
rounds
every
hour
and
it
was
then
by
the
big
clock
in
the
hall
i
know
the
wisest
thing
for
us
to
have
done
would
have
been
to
warn
the
watchman
and
let
miss
peyton
know
but
somehow
i
felt
that
we
could
cope
with
dum
by
ourselves
and
i
also
knew
that
the
offense
that
dum
was
guilty
of
was
a
very
serious
one
and
might
mean
that
she
would
be
expelled
from
gresham
the
moon
on
the
breast
of
the
snow
gave
a
luster
of
midday
to
objects
below
so
thank
goodness
the
prints
of
dum
tennis
shoes
were
quite
plain
to
us
i
was
relieved
to
see
that
they
went
toward
the
village
i
had
had
a
nameless
fear
of
the
lake
on
we
sped
once
we
saw
where
poor
dum
had
evidently
paused
and
then
turned
back
for
a
few
yards
that
encouraged
me
more
than
anything
we
had
found
out
yet
she
was
softening
and
relenting
what
do
you
suppose
she
means
to
do
page
panted
dee
she
is
trying
to
make
that
train
to
richmond
there
she
is
we
had
turned
a
sharp
corner
and
there
about
a
hundred
yards
ahead
of
us
was
dum
she
had
almost
reached
the
crossing
where
captain
leahy
had
his
unique
abode
one
minute
more
would
land
her
at
the
station
and
already
we
could
hear
the
whizzing
of
the
approaching
express
there
was
a
light
in
the
little
gatehouse
and
just
at
that
moment
the
dear
old
man
emerged
and
began
to
let
down
his
gate
well
saints
preserve
us
and
what
maid
travels
so
late
why
if
she
is
one
of
the
sponsors
of
oliver
dum
stopped
stockstill
in
the
road
captain
leahy
i
going
to
take
that
midnight
train
to
richmond
will
you
flag
it
for
me
and
sure
i
do
anything
to
please
the
ladies
but
are
ye
young
and
tinder
to
be
after
taking
such
a
thrip
at
this
toime
o
night
but
i
have
to
go
i
could
never
go
back
to
gresham
now
and
it
would
be
best
for
me
to
go
straight
to
my
father
dee
and
i
had
advanced
silently
thanks
to
our
rubber
shoes
and
we
now
came
up
behind
the
old
irishman
and
dum
come
on
dum
you
can
get
back
to
gresham
before
the
watchman
makes
his
one
rounds
if
you
hurry
dum
looked
at
me
aghast
page
you
here
and
dee
where
should
i
be
but
with
my
twin
we
have
never
spent
a
night
apart
yet
dumplingdeedledums
dee
tact
had
won
the
day
that
was
tucker
pet
name
for
dum
and
dee
using
it
at
such
a
time
brought
dum
to
her
senses
what
would
zebedee
think
and
say
of
this
escapade
was
what
came
to
dum
mind
captain
i
reckon
i
wo
go
to
richmond
have
to
hurry
to
get
in
before
one
that
the
now
whistling
for
the
crossing
and
before
the
old
man
could
get
his
breath
we
had
scurried
away
over
the
light
fall
of
snow
like
so
many
rabbits
it
was
uphill
most
of
the
way
back
to
gresham
but
we
made
short
work
of
it
if
i
had
not
been
so
desperately
afraid
the
watchman
would
discover
that
the
front
door
was
unlocked
before
we
got
back
and
perhaps
raise
an
alarm
i
would
have
enjoyed
our
run
immensely
the
moon
went
behind
a
great
black
cloud
but
we
knew
our
way
well
enough
not
to
be
dependent
on
her
light
not
one
word
did
we
speak
but
saved
our
breath
for
this
real
at
the
school
at
last
i
tried
the
great
door
almost
afraid
to
breathe
it
yielded
to
my
push
and
we
were
in
the
dark
hall
i
had
just
sense
enough
left
to
lock
the
door
and
then
we
flew
up
the
steps
and
were
safe
in
our
room
without
having
encountered
the
watchman
quick
work
i
gasped
falling
on
my
bed
down
to
the
station
and
back
in
forty
minutes
but
safety
was
not
ours
yet
we
heard
a
door
open
down
the
corridor
and
steps
approaching
in
bed
with
you
quick
exclaimed
dum
and
without
the
formality
of
night
dresses
we
jumped
into
bed
only
taking
the
precaution
to
remove
our
hats
diving
under
the
covers
with
only
our
noses
sticking
out
we
were
to
all
appearances
as
lost
to
the
world
as
the
seven
sleepers
it
was
a
teacher
who
had
evidently
heard
a
suspicious
noise
and
had
come
out
to
investigate
she
stopped
a
minute
in
front
of
our
door
and
then
gently
turned
the
knob
all
quiet
along
the
potomac
she
stood
a
minute
listening
to
dum
gently
taken
breath
and
dee
lifelike
snore
and
then
quietly
retired
on
tiptoe
and
in
a
moment
we
heard
her
door
close
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
if
we
got
dressed
like
engine
horses
going
to
a
fire
we
got
undressed
like
boys
seeing
who
can
get
into
the
swimming
hole
first
dum
kissed
us
both
or
rather
but
said
never
a
word
about
what
her
intentions
had
been
nor
the
reasons
for
her
flitting
we
were
asleep
in
a
minute
and
the
next
morning
i
had
to
pinch
myself
to
see
if
it
had
not
been
a
dream
our
damp
skirts
and
overshoes
and
each
girl
hat
under
her
bed
was
all
that
made
me
realize
that
we
had
been
on
that
mad
chase
at
midnight
after
the
irrepressible
dum
girls
you
are
both
bricks
exclaimed
dum
rubbing
her
eyes
as
the
relentless
rising
bell
tolled
out
just
think
if
you
had
not
come
for
me
i
would
have
been
in
richmond
by
this
time
and
poor
old
zebedee
disgraced
for
life
there
is
nothing
i
can
do
to
make
it
up
to
you
yes
there
is
chorused
dee
and
me
get
to
work
again
i
was
quite
through
what
i
was
saying
but
i
am
not
going
to
impose
the
fine
that
you
owe
for
interrupting
and
i
am
going
to
pay
my
fine
that
amounts
to
a
quarter
now
i
was
awfully
ashamed
of
not
paying
it
last
night
but
you
see
i
just
did
have
enough
money
to
get
me
to
richmond
if
i
traveled
on
a
day
coach
so
i
had
to
let
my
debts
of
honor
slide
i
have
been
a
bad
rude
unreasonable
girl
and
i
am
just
as
sorry
as
i
can
be
i
deserve
to
be
expelled
i
do
know
what
has
been
the
matter
with
me
but
i
believe
i
have
been
getting
ready
to
go
to
the
home
for
the
criminally
insane
i
hated
the
school
i
hated
the
teachers
i
hated
lessons
and
rules
i
just
wanted
zebedee
he
was
the
only
person
i
wanted
and
i
wanted
him
so
bad
i
was
just
going
to
have
him
dum
got
out
one
of
the
gentlemen
handkerchiefs
that
she
and
dee
used
and
wept
copiously
do
you
reckon
we
be
found
out
not
a
bit
of
it
i
reassured
her
the
blessed
snow
that
was
in
that
black
cloud
hiding
the
moon
last
night
has
covered
up
all
our
rabbit
tracks
and
when
we
take
our
walk
this
afternoon
i
am
going
to
slip
out
of
line
long
enough
to
warn
captain
leahy
not
to
tell
on
us
now
dum
you
get
back
to
bed
and
stay
there
all
day
i
am
going
to
tell
miss
peyton
you
do
feel
quite
up
to
snuff
which
is
certainly
so
you
jump
in
and
study
all
your
back
lessons
that
you
have
missed
and
catch
up
with
your
classes
it
will
take
a
day
of
diligent
work
to
do
it
because
you
have
loafed
ever
since
we
got
back
to
school
and
by
morning
you
will
feel
reconciled
to
life
and
take
your
place
again
well
that
would
be
kind
of
pleasant
but
bring
me
up
enough
breakfast
i
am
not
too
ill
to
eat
and
before
you
go
down
hand
me
those
brownies
i
made
last
night
and
dum
reduced
the
inoffensive
little
works
of
art
to
limbo
with
one
squeeze
of
her
hand
i
was
leaving
one
of
them
for
each
teacher
i
wanted
to
make
them
into
devils
but
thought
maybe
that
would
be
a
little
too
sassy
i
do
feel
a
bit
that
way
now
i
may
model
some
angels
if
i
can
get
time
after
i
have
mastered
all
my
back
work
miss
peyton
was
easily
persuaded
by
me
that
a
day
in
bed
would
restore
dum
to
health
and
reason
she
said
she
had
hoped
i
could
do
something
with
the
refractory
twin
and
she
was
going
to
trust
to
me
since
i
was
a
doctor
daughter
and
no
doubt
had
inherited
some
skill
as
a
healer
that
afternoon
when
we
took
our
walk
dee
and
i
got
permission
from
the
teacher
in
charge
to
stop
a
moment
at
the
crossing
presumably
to
call
on
oliver
and
see
how
much
he
had
grown
captain
leahy
i
cried
you
wo
tell
anyone
about
our
being
down
here
last
night
will
you
and
phwat
do
ye
take
me
for
he
asked
did
i
see
that
ye
were
after
saving
the
little
twinlet
and
that
she
was
crazy
with
homesickness
i
mind
too
well
the
time
many
years
ago
when
i
got
off
of
that
very
express
just
as
miss
peyton
then
a
wee
slip
of
a
maid
was
after
boarding
it
and
i
took
her
by
the
hand
and
led
her
back
to
gresham
she
weeping
bitterly
all
the
toime
she
was
half
mad
for
the
sight
of
her
folks
and
had
run
away
from
school
miss
peyton
we
exclaimed
in
one
breath
not
miss
peyton
the
principal
the
same
he
answered
and
this
is
the
first
toime
so
help
me
that
i
have
mintioned
it
to
a
livin
sowl
well
we
never
tell
captain
i
said
grasping
his
hand
and
do
i
know
that
would
i
be
divulging
the
loiks
to
ye
if
i
did
not
know
the
stoof
ye
are
made
of
i
just
tell
ye
so
ye
can
know
that
i
keep
the
little
twinlet
secret
as
long
as
i
have
miss
peyton
if
i
iver
tell
it
it
will
be
when
she
can
not
be
hurt
by
it
and
some
other
poor
little
lamb
can
be
you
want
us
to
tell
dum
do
you
asked
dee
for
sure
and
all
of
you
come
have
tea
with
me
soon
and
bring
miss
peyton
we
joined
the
line
of
girls
after
a
sharp
run
and
then
had
to
make
up
things
to
say
about
oliver
because
we
had
forgot
even
to
ask
about
him
miss
cox
spoke
to
me
on
the
way
to
supper
that
evening
she
looked
worried
and
her
face
was
crookeder
than
ever
but
her
eyes
had
a
very
kind
light
in
them
did
i
wake
you
last
night
page
when
i
opened
your
door
oh
was
that
you
i
involuntarily
exclaimed
i
had
an
idea
some
of
you
were
awake
and
the
kindly
woman
smiled
at
my
ingenuous
acknowledgment
i
was
afraid
to
knock
hoping
you
were
asleep
so
i
tried
the
door
and
peeped
in
i
did
not
mean
to
be
spying
but
i
have
been
very
uneasy
about
dum
lately
i
was
afraid
she
needed
some
friendly
advice
i
had
been
writing
late
and
had
not
been
able
to
get
to
sleep
and
i
was
almost
certain
i
heard
the
front
door
open
and
shut
i
simply
could
not
rest
without
making
sure
that
you
three
girls
were
safe
in
your
downies
i
had
thought
i
heard
something
some
forty
minutes
before
but
tried
to
make
myself
think
i
was
just
a
foolish
nervous
old
maid
i
felt
very
foolish
during
this
talk
and
could
hardly
look
kind
miss
cox
in
the
eye
but
i
did
not
consider
it
to
be
my
secret
and
i
said
nothing
mammy
susan
always
said
the
saftest
thing
in
fly
time
is
ter
keep
yo
mouf
shet
and
i
felt
that
this
was
fly
time
for
me
i
have
written
to
tucker
miss
cox
continued
i
do
want
the
twins
to
know
it
but
i
felt
it
was
my
duty
as
an
old
friend
of
both
their
parents
to
let
him
know
how
miserable
dum
is
oh
i
have
written
too
i
cried
i
wish
i
could
stop
my
letter
now
but
it
is
too
late
poor
tucker
will
think
things
are
in
a
terrible
way
with
dum
i
believe
she
is
herself
again
now
after
a
day
in
bed
but
i
just
felt
i
must
let
him
know
that
an
early
visit
from
him
would
be
advisable
i
would
let
tweedles
find
out
for
a
million
that
i
have
done
it
well
you
keep
my
secret
and
i
keep
yours
i
am
glad
the
tuckers
father
and
daughters
have
such
a
wholesome
friend
as
you
and
miss
cox
pressed
my
hand
warmly
chapter
xxii
more
letters
from
miss
jane
cox
to
jeffry
tucker
my
dear
jeff
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
write
you
in
regard
to
your
daughter
virginia
i
told
you
i
would
look
after
your
girls
and
i
have
tried
to
but
since
the
holidays
dum
has
been
very
difficult
and
the
teachers
hardly
know
how
to
cope
with
her
my
private
opinion
is
that
the
child
is
longing
so
for
you
that
she
is
in
a
fair
way
to
be
made
sick
by
it
a
vacation
of
three
weeks
seems
to
be
very
upsetting
and
a
great
many
of
the
pupils
find
it
hard
to
get
back
into
line
but
dum
does
not
even
want
to
so
far
as
i
can
see
i
do
not
mean
to
complain
of
dum
you
surely
understand
that
but
i
want
to
let
you
know
the
state
of
affairs
i
am
writing
entirely
on
my
own
hook
as
your
friend
and
the
friend
of
the
other
little
virginia
companion
of
my
youth
i
fancy
miss
peyton
would
not
approve
of
my
doing
it
as
she
feels
able
to
master
poor
dum
by
kindness
but
i
have
studied
her
closely
and
feel
that
i
understand
her
temperament
better
than
our
beloved
principal
i
have
been
afraid
the
child
might
take
it
into
her
head
to
run
away
from
school
it
is
not
that
she
does
not
like
gresham
i
believe
she
likes
it
very
much
she
is
popular
with
the
whole
school
and
has
many
friends
she
is
a
good
student
and
has
done
well
up
to
the
time
she
returned
from
richmond
since
that
time
her
marks
have
been
zero
page
allison
who
has
a
very
good
influence
on
all
the
girls
with
whom
she
comes
in
contact
is
looking
after
her
and
she
may
be
able
to
bring
her
to
reason
but
in
the
meantime
my
dear
jeff
i
want
you
to
write
to
dum
very
often
of
course
not
mentioning
the
fact
that
you
have
heard
from
me
and
give
her
hopes
of
a
visit
from
you
in
the
near
future
that
would
mean
everything
to
her
of
course
an
attempt
to
run
away
from
school
would
be
a
very
serious
fault
if
discovered
because
of
the
effect
on
the
rest
of
the
pupils
i
do
want
to
alarm
you
but
i
feel
that
i
would
be
a
poor
friend
indeed
if
i
did
not
let
you
know
of
the
trouble
your
little
daughter
is
in
a
fair
way
to
get
herself
into
dee
is
back
at
work
and
doing
finely
although
as
a
rule
she
is
not
a
better
student
than
dum
i
am
told
that
during
study
hall
this
evening
dum
made
no
effort
to
concentrate
on
her
lessons
but
spent
the
whole
time
modeling
grotesque
little
figures
in
colored
clay
hoping
you
will
take
this
information
as
it
is
meant
not
thinking
that
i
am
a
tattle
tale
tit
but
that
i
have
the
welfare
of
the
children
of
my
old
friends
very
much
at
heart
and
that
it
would
be
a
cowardly
and
selfish
act
for
me
to
hold
back
for
fear
of
being
misunderstood
i
am
your
sincere
friend
jinny
cox
from
jeffry
tucker
to
miss
jane
cox
jinny
dear
you
always
were
a
trump
and
i
can
never
express
to
you
the
gratitude
i
feel
for
the
letter
you
have
written
me
about
my
poor
little
headstrong
dum
she
was
particularly
docile
about
returning
to
school
but
as
i
told
her
at
the
station
she
had
a
kind
of
smoldering
look
in
her
eyes
that
bodest
no
good
she
has
the
most
generous
and
kind
heart
in
the
world
but
has
always
been
the
more
difficult
of
the
twins
to
manage
the
matter
is
she
has
an
artistic
temperament
but
i
have
been
trying
to
conceal
this
fact
from
her
all
her
life
as
i
think
when
a
person
once
discovers
he
has
an
artistic
temperament
he
can
commit
any
crime
in
the
name
of
his
temperament
and
feel
that
the
world
must
forgive
him
i
want
my
little
virginia
to
understand
that
it
is
up
to
her
to
behave
just
as
well
as
the
ordinary
folks
who
have
no
temperament
to
speak
of
i
am
writing
to
her
by
this
mail
but
of
course
she
is
never
to
know
you
wrote
to
me
i
am
coming
up
to
gresham
for
a
little
visit
just
as
soon
as
my
strenuous
duties
will
permit
and
then
i
hope
we
can
have
another
lobster
quadrille
i
am
very
thankful
that
tweedles
has
such
a
delightful
companion
as
miss
page
allison
she
has
improved
them
more
than
all
the
schooling
in
the
world
would
i
am
also
thankful
beyond
measure
that
they
have
found
such
a
friend
as
you
are
dear
jinny
keep
on
being
good
to
them
and
if
dum
shows
further
signs
of
insubordination
please
telegraph
me
i
come
if
no
newspaper
is
published
from
this
office
for
a
month
thanking
you
again
dear
friend
in
my
name
and
also
for
the
little
virginia
companion
of
your
youth
very
truly
yours
jeffry
tucker
from
page
allison
to
jeffry
tucker
dear
tucker
i
ca
bear
to
worry
you
but
i
think
you
ought
to
know
that
dum
wants
to
see
you
mighty
bad
she
has
been
very
restless
since
we
got
back
to
gresham
and
while
she
is
quieter
now
and
says
she
is
going
to
study
hard
and
be
a
model
pupil
henceforth
i
am
afraid
she
will
break
down
because
she
has
so
many
demerits
to
work
off
miss
peyton
has
been
very
kind
and
patient
but
of
course
it
would
not
be
fair
to
the
other
students
to
let
up
on
dum
and
i
believe
she
has
enough
demerits
to
keep
her
in
bounds
for
about
three
weeks
now
please
do
think
i
am
bossy
but
if
you
could
write
her
and
tell
her
that
you
think
you
might
get
up
to
gresham
in
about
three
weeks
that
would
give
her
some
ambition
to
work
off
those
marks
and
not
get
any
others
you
see
if
she
is
in
bounds
when
you
come
she
ca
see
much
of
you
i
do
want
tweedles
to
know
i
am
writing
this
to
you
but
if
you
should
mention
having
got
a
letter
from
me
you
can
call
it
a
bread
and
butter
letter
you
were
so
kind
to
me
on
my
visit
to
the
girls
i
had
about
the
gayest
and
best
time
i
ever
had
in
my
life
and
i
do
want
to
thank
you
for
it
very
sincerely
page
allison
miss
page
allison
from
jeffry
tucker
my
dear
miss
page
your
word
is
law
in
three
weeks
time
i
will
be
in
gresham
i
do
consider
you
a
bit
bossy
but
very
sweet
and
kind
and
wise
thank
god
my
poor
little
dum
has
made
such
a
friend
i
wish
i
could
flatter
myself
that
i
could
call
you
friend
as
my
girls
can
i
thank
you
from
my
soul
for
your
interest
in
tweedles
most
gratefully
jeffry
tucker
jeffry
tucker
to
his
daughters
virginia
and
caroline
dearest
and
best
beloved
tweedles
surely
is
an
ill
wind
that
blows
nobody
any
good
know
you
that
there
has
been
a
big
shooting
scrape
up
in
the
mountains
and
it
is
of
such
importance
that
i
have
decided
to
cover
the
trial
myself
instead
of
sending
a
reporter
this
trial
comes
off
in
a
little
over
three
weeks
and
as
gresham
is
on
the
way
i
am
going
to
stop
off
to
see
my
babies
and
hope
they
will
be
glad
to
have
their
old
zebedee
with
them
for
a
day
or
so
i
manage
to
get
there
on
saturday
afternoon
and
stay
until
monday
night
be
good
girls
until
then
so
you
will
not
have
any
hateful
demerits
to
work
off
i
miss
you
so
much
more
than
i
did
at
first
but
i
trying
to
be
a
very
good
boy
and
stick
to
business
i
can
hardly
wait
to
see
you
give
my
kindest
regards
to
miss
page
and
tell
her
not
to
get
any
demerits
between
now
and
the
time
of
my
visit
as
she
must
do
whatever
the
tuckers
do
on
that
visit
your
own
zebedee
chapter
xxiii
zebedee
visit
tucker
promise
of
a
visit
did
all
that
i
knew
it
would
for
dum
she
worked
off
her
demerits
without
a
murmur
studied
her
lessons
diligently
soon
caught
up
in
her
classes
and
was
altogether
an
exemplary
dum
if
his
promise
of
a
visit
worked
such
wonders
his
visit
completed
the
miracle
we
had
already
come
through
our
examinations
some
with
flying
colors
and
some
with
tattered
banners
like
the
poor
confederate
flags
that
you
see
in
the
valentine
museum
in
richmond
but
the
thing
was
that
we
were
through
and
none
of
our
little
crowd
of
cronies
had
failed
annie
pore
carried
off
the
honors
in
latin
thanks
to
the
drilling
she
had
been
brought
up
on
by
the
severe
oxford
graduate
dum
was
easily
first
in
mathematics
dee
seemed
to
know
the
physiology
off
by
heart
history
was
mary
flannigan
forte
and
not
a
date
from
noah
flood
to
the
san
francisco
earthquake
could
stump
her
literature
was
what
most
interested
me
and
it
would
have
been
silly
not
to
get
an
honor
when
it
did
seem
so
easy
we
were
rather
proud
of
our
achievements
as
a
coterie
of
chums
and
miss
peyton
as
a
reward
of
merit
let
all
of
us
go
to
the
station
to
meet
tucker
accompanied
by
miss
cox
how
good
it
was
to
see
him
i
believe
i
was
almost
as
glad
as
tweedles
he
looked
very
boyish
indeed
as
he
swung
off
the
pullman
a
suitcase
in
one
hand
and
a
great
basket
neatly
covered
with
purple
paper
in
the
other
i
know
what
that
purple
paper
means
cried
dee
from
afar
he
been
to
schmidt
and
that
basket
full
of
goodies
so
he
had
and
zebedee
like
had
a
proposition
for
pleasure
i
have
seldom
seen
tucker
that
he
did
not
have
some
scheme
on
hand
for
amusement
for
someone
and
the
best
thing
about
it
was
that
he
usually
was
ready
to
partake
of
the
fun
himself
and
his
partaking
of
it
meant
there
was
twice
as
much
fun
as
there
would
have
been
without
him
there
skating
on
the
lake
surely
he
asked
yes
yes
in
chorus
well
come
along
and
i
get
permission
from
your
lord
high
executioner
to
take
all
of
you
skating
and
we
have
supper
on
the
bank
what
do
you
say
to
that
jinny
splendid
i
have
skated
for
years
though
have
you
got
your
skates
oh
yes
you
see
this
is
all
the
home
i
have
so
i
got
everything
i
possess
here
and
you
girls
all
of
you
have
skates
that
fit
and
shoes
to
skate
in
yes
yes
and
off
we
went
the
gayest
crowd
imaginable
of
course
miss
peyton
let
us
go
no
one
had
ever
refused
tucker
anything
in
reason
i
am
sure
nor
had
he
ever
asked
for
anything
out
of
reason
will
you
have
enough
food
for
such
a
crowd
had
you
not
better
come
back
to
gresham
to
supper
asked
miss
peyton
never
fear
i
have
food
enough
for
a
dozen
boys
i
take
good
care
of
all
of
them
and
bring
them
back
at
bedtime
there
was
another
crowd
on
the
lake
when
we
got
there
a
party
of
greshamites
juniors
and
seniors
and
some
boys
from
the
ice
was
perfect
and
while
the
air
was
cold
it
was
not
cutting
but
dry
and
invigorating
we
put
our
basket
in
a
safe
place
that
is
a
place
where
everyone
could
see
it
tucker
said
the
way
to
lose
things
especially
food
was
to
hide
it
so
he
placed
it
on
top
of
a
little
hillock
overlooking
the
lake
where
it
looked
like
a
great
bunch
of
violets
against
the
patches
of
snow
our
skates
did
fit
and
our
shoes
were
suitable
so
we
were
on
the
ice
in
no
time
one
of
the
most
irritating
things
under
heaven
is
to
go
skating
with
persons
whose
skates
do
fit
or
whose
heels
are
too
high
or
soles
too
thin
i
had
learned
to
skate
on
the
duck
pond
at
home
and
while
on
the
duck
pond
my
stroke
had
been
necessarily
limited
i
found
when
i
got
on
the
broad
lake
i
could
hold
my
own
very
well
annie
pore
was
timid
and
faltering
if
she
tried
to
skate
alone
but
did
very
well
if
she
had
a
partner
mary
flannigan
singularly
ungraceful
but
a
real
racer
with
flapping
arms
and
bowed
legs
could
get
over
the
ice
faster
than
the
fleetest
boy
from
the
twins
skated
well
as
they
did
everything
in
the
way
of
athletics
and
wonderfully
handsome
they
looked
skimming
over
the
lake
arm
in
arm
miss
cox
was
a
revelation
to
us
all
she
had
not
skated
for
years
but
her
stroke
was
as
sure
as
it
had
ever
been
and
in
five
minutes
she
and
tucker
were
doing
the
double
dutch
roll
together
now
frontward
now
backward
with
all
kinds
of
intricate
strokes
i
suddenly
realized
that
with
all
of
her
crooked
homeliness
miss
cox
was
far
from
plain
her
figure
was
singularly
graceful
and
her
head
very
well
set
the
boys
cheered
as
they
approached
the
far
bank
where
the
ice
was
a
little
better
who
all
right
who
all
right
miss
cox
miss
cox
out
of
sight
i
was
supporting
annie
pore
so
was
necessarily
going
slowly
and
i
heard
one
of
the
juniors
say
to
mabel
binks
who
was
looking
very
handsome
in
a
red
silk
sweater
and
cap
to
match
who
the
man
with
miss
cox
they
are
some
skaters
for
sure
oh
hello
exclaimed
mabel
if
that
ai
my
beau
from
richmond
i
did
not
hear
any
more
but
i
felt
amused
a
little
and
indignant
a
good
deal
harvie
price
was
among
the
boys
and
he
immediately
skated
up
and
got
in
between
annie
and
me
he
was
a
strong
skater
and
soon
we
found
ourselves
doing
stunts
with
him
that
we
had
not
dreamed
possible
that
dutch
roll
is
not
so
hard
when
you
get
the
hang
of
it
see
like
this
raise
your
right
foot
not
too
high
strike
out
with
your
left
a
good
long
stroke
and
then
down
with
your
right
crossing
the
left
just
look
at
us
we
are
not
quite
up
to
tucker
and
miss
cox
but
we
surely
are
good
enough
to
have
some
notice
taken
of
us
and
so
we
were
pride
goeth
before
a
fall
however
and
just
as
we
were
getting
the
hang
of
the
stroke
we
ran
plump
into
mary
flannigan
and
shorty
who
were
having
a
race
backward
and
the
five
of
us
fell
into
an
ignominious
heap
nobody
was
hurt
not
even
feelings
tucker
picked
me
up
and
skated
off
with
me
who
was
that
young
fellow
you
were
skating
with
oh
that
was
harvie
price
he
a
mighty
nice
boy
and
an
old
friend
of
annie
pore
and
that
little
runty
boy
with
the
bright
face
the
cause
of
your
recent
disaster
who
was
he
tommy
hawkins
shorty
is
he
yes
very
i
going
to
ask
these
boys
to
stay
and
have
supper
with
us
you
introduce
me
and
then
i
make
myself
known
to
the
teacher
i
see
over
there
and
if
i
include
him
in
the
invitation
maybe
i
can
get
permission
for
the
boys
to
stay
of
course
the
boys
were
delighted
and
with
a
great
deal
of
finesse
tucker
ingratiated
himself
into
the
affections
of
the
teacher
who
had
them
in
charge
a
anderson
and
he
accepted
for
himself
with
alacrity
and
gave
the
boys
permission
i
wish
i
had
grub
enough
for
the
whole
ship
crew
of
them
sighed
tucker
if
there
is
anything
in
the
world
i
like
it
is
to
give
a
boy
a
treat
but
seven
of
us
and
anderson
and
the
two
boys
will
just
about
clean
up
my
basket
i
wanted
to
ask
four
boys
so
we
could
all
but
i
was
so
afraid
of
running
short
mabel
binks
had
been
circling
around
us
determined
to
attract
tucker
attention
he
had
given
her
a
polite
bow
but
held
tightly
to
my
hands
and
skated
on
by
her
she
was
a
good
skater
and
her
red
sweater
showed
off
her
figure
to
great
advantage
dum
and
dee
came
racing
up
to
us
and
we
all
caught
hold
of
hands
and
went
the
length
of
the
lake
together
do
we
four
get
on
well
together
zebedee
exclaimed
dee
we
certainly
do
he
answered
heartily
miss
page
seems
to
be
just
the
oil
needed
to
make
us
salt
pepper
vinegar
hot
tuckers
into
a
palatable
dressing
look
here
zebedee
it
is
up
to
you
to
skate
with
that
despicable
thing
mabel
binks
and
dum
looked
sternly
at
her
parent
i
do
see
it
that
way
he
answered
coolly
well
you
see
she
has
gone
around
claiming
you
as
her
richmond
beau
who
came
up
to
gresham
to
see
her
and
now
she
says
that
i
wo
let
you
skate
with
her
too
bad
that
he
laughed
well
honey
you
can
tell
her
that
you
have
no
influence
over
me
at
all
you
could
not
keep
me
from
skating
with
her
nor
can
you
make
me
do
it
the
machinations
of
mabel
however
were
beyond
our
ken
she
came
bearing
down
on
us
all
sails
spread
as
it
were
we
tacked
as
best
we
could
but
the
determined
girl
turned
at
that
moment
and
skated
backward
right
into
our
line
dee
who
was
next
to
me
broke
and
avoided
her
but
i
got
the
collision
full
force
and
went
down
with
an
awful
whack
with
mabel
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
right
on
top
of
me
the
best
laid
schemes
o
mice
an
men
gang
aft
mabel
had
meant
to
occupy
the
center
of
the
stage
herself
and
here
was
i
page
allison
knocked
senseless
for
a
moment
by
the
fall
while
mabel
was
simply
pulled
off
me
by
the
infuriated
zebedee
and
left
to
shift
for
herself
dum
said
she
looked
awfully
silly
as
she
got
unaided
to
her
feet
of
course
i
could
see
nothing
as
i
was
so
dazed
by
the
fall
that
at
first
i
lay
with
my
eyes
closed
in
a
moment
the
crowd
of
skaters
had
gathered
and
dee
told
me
it
was
like
a
dog
fight
everybody
trying
to
see
at
once
page
little
page
are
you
dead
were
the
first
words
that
i
heard
and
tucker
face
the
first
one
i
saw
dead
i
should
say
not
i
not
even
hurt
let
me
get
up
and
i
caught
hold
of
his
ready
hand
and
struggled
to
my
feet
she
not
hurt
she
all
right
he
called
to
the
anxious
tweedles
who
had
been
pushed
back
by
the
curious
crowd
and
he
wiped
the
tears
from
his
eyes
then
the
boys
from
gave
me
a
yell
our
especial
yell
that
we
sophomores
used
at
moments
of
supreme
victory
ice
cream
soda
water
ginger
ale
pop
sophomores
sophomores
always
on
top
i
wish
i
had
been
i
said
ruefully
and
there
was
a
general
laugh
a
whistle
from
gresham
warned
the
girls
that
it
was
time
to
go
back
to
the
school
and
in
a
short
time
the
boys
had
to
leave
all
but
harvie
and
shorty
and
the
tutor
anderson
we
piled
more
brush
on
the
fire
that
had
been
started
to
warm
toes
by
and
in
a
little
while
we
had
a
blaze
that
as
dusk
came
on
lighted
up
the
whole
lake
and
made
up
for
the
lack
of
a
moon
i
never
saw
such
a
wonderful
lunch
as
tucker
had
brought
there
were
sandwiches
of
all
kinds
cream
cheese
and
pimento
chicken
ham
tongue
and
lettuce
there
was
a
great
jar
of
chicken
salad
beaten
biscuit
cheese
straws
olives
pickles
and
salted
almonds
and
a
chocolate
cake
even
larger
than
dum
best
hat
that
tucker
had
sent
for
the
thanksgiving
spread
bleat
my
little
goat
bleat
cover
the
table
with
something
to
eat
sang
dum
zebedee
you
seem
to
me
to
be
working
magic
i
do
see
how
all
those
things
could
have
been
packed
in
that
basket
if
yours
had
been
the
task
to
it
this
far
you
would
have
thought
there
was
more
than
that
in
it
he
answered
well
ours
will
be
the
task
to
help
it
back
said
dee
in
tones
muffled
by
cream
cheese
the
crowning
wonder
of
the
repast
was
some
great
thermos
bottles
that
finally
emerged
from
the
bottom
of
the
capacious
basket
one
was
filled
with
hot
coffee
and
the
other
with
hot
chocolate
and
lying
snugly
by
them
was
a
jar
of
whipped
cream
well
by
the
great
jumping
jingo
what
next
said
shorty
and
then
funny
mary
flannigan
used
her
ventriloquist
powers
and
made
a
noise
exactly
like
a
puppy
trying
to
get
out
of
something
and
shorty
bit
he
dived
into
the
basket
to
the
assistance
of
the
imaginary
canine
the
coffee
and
chocolate
were
smoking
hot
in
spite
of
the
long
journey
they
had
taken
tucker
had
made
a
clever
calculation
also
as
to
the
number
of
guests
so
the
drinkables
just
did
go
around
i
thought
i
heard
miss
binks
say
she
was
going
to
have
supper
with
you
said
harvie
price
to
dum
ah
indeed
i
fancy
she
did
intend
to
but
after
she
made
a
hole
in
the
ice
with
poor
little
page
i
reckon
she
forgot
to
wait
for
her
invitation
we
ate
up
every
crumb
of
that
supper
and
the
little
birds
who
hoped
to
feast
on
what
we
left
must
have
had
but
poor
pickings
we
sha
have
to
say
bleat
my
little
goat
i
pray
and
take
the
table
quite
away
laughed
tucker
if
i
had
been
twins
instead
of
tweedles
i
have
brought
twice
that
much
we
had
had
enough
and
much
gayety
and
repartee
had
made
it
a
very
delightful
party
anderson
proved
very
agreeable
and
made
himself
pleasant
to
everybody
miss
cox
was
happy
and
full
of
fun
and
even
annie
pore
forgot
to
be
shy
and
actually
rolled
shorty
in
a
patch
of
snow
because
he
stole
a
piece
of
chocolate
cake
all
icing
that
she
was
saving
for
the
last
mouthful
everything
must
have
an
end
even
skating
parties
and
books
but
there
will
be
more
skating
parties
and
more
books
too
on
the
way
back
to
gresham
tucker
divulged
to
us
that
he
had
a
scheme
for
pleasure
and
if
we
girls
one
and
all
studied
hard
and
if
miss
cox
would
promise
to
be
as
blind
to
our
faults
as
she
honorably
could
we
were
all
of
us
included
in
the
scheme
he
had
engaged
a
cottage
at
willoughby
beach
for
the
month
of
july
and
there
we
were
to
camp
out
and
live
the
simple
life
oh
how
grand
we
gasped
together
we
had
something
to
look
forward
to
now
and
knew
that
the
last
half
of
the
year
would
fly
by
we
could
hardly
wait
for
the
camping
time
to
come
and
i
just
hope
my
readers
are
as
anxious
to
hear
about
my
vacation
with
the
tucker
twins
as
i
am
anxious
to
tell
them
about
it
