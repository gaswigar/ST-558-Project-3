where

was

but
the
story
itself
is
intact
the
boy
the
elf
march
once
there
was
a
boy
he
was
let
us
say
something
like
fourteen
years
old
long
and
and
towheaded
he
was
good
for
much
that
boy
his
chief
delight
was
to
eat
and
sleep
and
after
that
he
liked
best
to
make
mischief
it
was
a
sunday
morning
and
the
boy
parents
were
getting
ready
to
go
to
church
the
boy
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
table
in
his
shirt
sleeves
and
thought
how
lucky
it
was
that
both
father
and
mother
were
going
away
and
the
coast
would
be
clear
for
a
couple
of
hours
good
now
i
can
take
down
pop
gun
and
fire
off
a
shot
without
anybody
meddling
interference
he
said
to
himself
but
it
was
almost
as
if
father
should
have
guessed
the
boy
thoughts
for
just
as
he
was
on
the
threshold
ready
to
start
he
stopped
short
and
turned
toward
the
boy
since
you
wo
come
to
church
with
mother
and
me
he
said
the
least
you
can
do
is
to
read
the
service
at
home
will
you
promise
to
do
so
yes
said
the
boy
that
i
can
do
easy
enough
and
he
thought
of
course
that
he
would
read
any
more
than
he
felt
like
reading
the
boy
thought
that
never
had
he
seen
his
mother
so
persistent
in
a
second
she
was
over
by
the
shelf
near
the
fireplace
and
took
down
luther
commentary
and
laid
it
on
the
table
in
front
of
the
window
opened
at
the
service
for
the
day
she
also
opened
the
new
testament
and
placed
it
beside
the
commentary
finally
she
drew
up
the
big
which
was
bought
at
the
parish
auction
the
year
before
and
which
as
a
rule
no
one
but
father
was
permitted
to
occupy
the
boy
sat
thinking
that
his
mother
was
giving
herself
altogether
too
much
trouble
with
this
spread
for
he
had
no
intention
of
reading
more
than
a
page
or
so
but
now
for
the
second
time
it
was
almost
as
if
his
father
were
able
to
see
right
through
him
he
walked
up
to
the
boy
and
said
in
a
severe
tone
now
remember
that
you
are
to
read
carefully
for
when
we
come
back
i
shall
question
you
thoroughly
and
if
you
have
skipped
a
single
page
it
will
not
go
well
with
you
the
service
is
fourteen
and
a
half
pages
long
said
his
mother
just
as
if
she
wanted
to
heap
up
the
measure
of
his
misfortune
you
have
to
sit
down
and
begin
the
reading
at
once
if
you
expect
to
get
through
with
it
with
that
they
departed
and
as
the
boy
stood
in
the
doorway
watching
them
he
thought
that
he
had
been
caught
in
a
trap
there
they
go
congratulating
themselves
i
suppose
in
the
belief
that
they
hit
upon
something
so
good
that
i
be
forced
to
sit
and
hang
over
the
sermon
the
whole
time
that
they
are
away
thought
he
but
his
father
and
mother
were
certainly
not
congratulating
themselves
upon
anything
of
the
sort
but
on
the
contrary
they
were
very
much
distressed
they
were
poor
farmers
and
their
place
was
not
much
bigger
than
a
when
they
first
moved
there
the
place
could
feed
more
than
one
pig
and
a
pair
of
chickens
but
they
were
uncommonly
industrious
and
capable
folk
and
now
they
had
both
cows
and
geese
things
had
turned
out
very
well
for
them
and
they
would
have
gone
to
church
that
beautiful
morning
satisfied
and
happy
if
they
had
had
their
son
to
think
of
father
complained
that
he
was
dull
and
lazy
he
had
not
cared
to
learn
anything
at
school
and
he
was
such
an
that
he
could
barely
be
made
to
tend
geese
mother
did
not
deny
that
this
was
true
but
she
was
most
distressed
because
he
was
wild
and
bad
cruel
to
animals
and
toward
human
beings
may
god
soften
his
hard
heart
and
give
him
a
better
disposition
said
the
mother
or
else
he
will
be
a
misfortune
both
to
himself
and
to
us
the
boy
stood
for
a
long
time
and
pondered
whether
he
should
read
the
service
or
not
finally
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
this
time
it
was
best
to
be
obedient
he
seated
himself
in
the
easy
chair
and
began
to
read
but
when
he
had
been
rattling
away
in
an
undertone
for
a
little
while
this
mumbling
seemed
to
have
a
soothing
effect
upon
him
and
he
began
to
nod
it
was
the
most
beautiful
weather
outside
it
was
only
the
twentieth
of
march
but
the
boy
lived
in
west
vemminghög
township
down
in
southern
skane
where
the
spring
was
already
in
full
swing
it
was
not
as
yet
green
but
it
was
fresh
and
budding
there
was
water
in
all
the
trenches
and
the
on
the
edge
of
the
ditch
was
in
bloom
all
the
weeds
that
grew
in
among
the
stones
were
brown
and
shiny
the
in
the
distance
seemed
to
swell
and
grow
thicker
with
every
second
the
skies
were
high
and
a
clear
blue
the
cottage
door
stood
ajar
and
the
lark
trill
could
be
heard
in
the
room
the
hens
and
geese
pattered
about
in
the
yard
and
the
cows
who
felt
the
spring
air
away
in
their
stalls
lowed
their
approval
every
now
and
then
the
boy
read
and
nodded
and
fought
against
drowsiness
no
i
do
want
to
fall
asleep
thought
he
for
then
i
not
get
through
with
this
thing
the
whole
forenoon
but
somehow
he
fell
asleep
he
did
not
know
whether
he
had
slept
a
short
while
or
a
long
while
but
he
was
awakened
by
hearing
a
slight
noise
back
of
him
on
the
facing
the
boy
stood
a
small
and
almost
the
entire
cottage
could
be
seen
in
this
as
the
boy
raised
his
head
he
happened
to
look
in
the
glass
and
then
he
saw
that
the
cover
to
his
mother
chest
had
been
opened
his
mother
owned
a
great
heavy
oak
chest
which
she
permitted
no
one
but
herself
to
open
here
she
treasured
all
the
things
she
had
inherited
from
her
mother
and
of
these
she
was
especially
careful
here
lay
a
couple
of
peasant
dresses
of
red
homespun
cloth
with
short
bodice
and
plaited
shirt
and
a
breast
pin
there
were
starched
and
heavy
silver
ornaments
and
chains
folks
do
care
to
go
about
dressed
like
that
in
these
days
and
several
times
his
mother
had
thought
of
getting
rid
of
the
old
things
but
somehow
she
had
had
the
heart
to
do
it
now
the
boy
saw
distinctly
in
the
glass
that
the
was
open
he
could
not
understand
how
this
had
happened
for
his
mother
had
closed
the
chest
before
she
went
away
she
never
would
have
left
that
precious
chest
open
when
he
was
at
home
alone
he
became
and
apprehensive
he
was
afraid
that
a
thief
had
sneaked
his
way
into
the
cottage
he
did
dare
to
move
but
sat
still
and
stared
into
the
while
he
sat
there
and
waited
for
the
thief
to
make
his
appearance
he
began
to
wonder
what
that
dark
shadow
was
which
fell
across
the
edge
of
the
chest
he
looked
and
looked
and
did
not
want
to
believe
his
eyes
but
the
thing
which
at
first
seemed
shadowy
became
more
and
more
clear
to
him
and
soon
he
saw
that
it
was
something
real
it
was
no
less
a
thing
than
an
elf
who
sat
there
astride
the
edge
of
the
chest
to
be
sure
the
boy
had
heard
stories
about
elves
but
he
had
never
dreamed
that
they
were
such
tiny
creatures
he
was
no
taller
than
a
hand
breadth
this
one
who
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
chest
he
had
an
old
wrinkled
and
beardless
face
and
was
dressed
in
a
black
frock
coat
and
a
black
hat
he
was
very
trim
and
smart
with
his
white
laces
about
the
throat
and
his
buckled
shoes
and
the
bows
on
his
garters
he
had
taken
from
the
chest
an
embroidered
piece
and
sat
and
looked
at
the
handiwork
with
such
an
air
of
veneration
that
he
did
not
observe
the
boy
had
awakened
the
boy
was
somewhat
surprised
to
see
the
elf
but
on
the
other
hand
he
was
not
particularly
frightened
it
was
impossible
to
be
afraid
of
one
who
was
so
little
and
since
the
elf
was
so
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
that
he
neither
saw
nor
heard
the
boy
thought
that
it
would
be
great
fun
to
play
a
trick
on
him
to
push
him
over
into
the
chest
and
shut
the
lid
on
him
or
something
of
that
kind
but
the
boy
was
not
so
courageous
that
he
dared
to
touch
the
elf
with
his
hands
instead
he
looked
around
the
room
for
something
to
poke
him
with
he
let
his
gaze
wander
from
the
sofa
to
the
from
the
to
the
fireplace
he
looked
at
the
kettles
then
at
the
which
stood
on
a
shelf
near
the
fireplace
on
the
water
bucket
near
the
door
and
on
the
spoons
and
knives
and
forks
and
saucers
and
plates
which
could
be
seen
through
the
cupboard
door
he
looked
at
his
father
gun
which
hung
on
the
wall
beside
the
portrait
of
the
danish
royal
family
and
on
the
geraniums
and
fuchsias
which
blossomed
in
the
window
and
last
he
caught
sight
of
an
old
that
hung
on
the
window
frame
he
had
hardly
set
eyes
on
that
before
he
reached
over
and
snatched
it
and
jumped
up
and
swung
it
alongside
the
edge
of
the
chest
he
was
himself
astonished
at
the
luck
he
had
he
hardly
knew
how
he
had
managed
it
but
he
had
actually
snared
the
elf
the
poor
little
chap
lay
head
downward
in
the
bottom
of
the
long
snare
and
could
not
free
himself
the
first
moment
the
boy
had
the
least
idea
what
he
should
do
with
his
prize
he
was
only
particular
to
swing
the
snare
backward
and
forward
to
prevent
the
elf
from
getting
a
foothold
and
clambering
up
the
elf
began
to
speak
and
begged
oh
so
pitifully
for
his
freedom
he
had
brought
them
good
luck
these
many
years
he
said
and
deserved
better
treatment
now
if
the
boy
would
set
him
free
he
would
give
him
an
old
coin
a
silver
spoon
and
a
gold
penny
as
big
as
the
case
on
his
father
silver
watch
the
boy
did
think
that
this
was
much
of
an
offer
but
it
so
happened
that
after
he
had
gotten
the
elf
in
his
power
he
was
afraid
of
him
he
felt
that
he
had
entered
into
an
agreement
with
something
weird
and
uncanny
something
which
did
not
belong
to
his
world
and
he
was
only
too
glad
to
get
rid
of
the
horrid
thing
for
this
reason
he
agreed
at
once
to
the
bargain
and
held
the
snare
still
so
the
elf
could
crawl
out
of
it
but
when
the
elf
was
almost
out
of
the
snare
the
boy
happened
to
think
that
he
ought
to
have
bargained
for
large
estates
and
all
sorts
of
good
things
he
should
at
least
have
made
this
stipulation
that
the
elf
must
conjure
the
sermon
into
his
head
what
a
fool
i
was
to
let
him
go
thought
he
and
began
to
shake
the
snare
violently
so
the
elf
would
tumble
down
again
but
the
instant
the
boy
did
this
he
received
such
a
stinging
box
on
the
ear
that
he
thought
his
head
would
fly
in
pieces
he
was
dashed
first
against
one
wall
then
against
the
other
he
sank
to
the
floor
and
lay
there
senseless
when
he
awoke
he
was
alone
in
the
cottage
the
was
down
and
the
hung
in
its
usual
place
by
the
window
if
he
had
not
felt
how
the
right
cheek
burned
from
that
box
on
the
ear
he
would
have
been
tempted
to
believe
the
whole
thing
had
been
a
dream
at
any
rate
father
and
mother
will
be
sure
to
insist
that
it
was
nothing
else
thought
he
they
are
not
likely
to
make
any
allowances
for
that
old
sermon
on
account
of
the
elf
it
best
for
me
to
get
at
that
reading
again
thought
he
but
as
he
walked
toward
the
table
he
noticed
something
remarkable
it
could
be
possible
that
the
cottage
had
grown
but
why
was
he
obliged
to
take
so
many
more
steps
than
usual
to
get
to
the
table
and
what
was
the
matter
with
the
chair
it
looked
no
bigger
than
it
did
a
while
ago
but
now
he
had
to
step
on
the
rung
first
and
then
clamber
up
in
order
to
reach
the
seat
it
was
the
same
thing
with
the
table
he
could
not
look
over
the
top
without
climbing
to
the
arm
of
the
chair
what
in
all
the
world
is
this
said
the
boy
i
believe
the
elf
has
bewitched
both
the
armchair
and
the
table
and
the
whole
cottage
the
commentary
lay
on
the
table
and
to
all
appearances
it
was
not
changed
but
there
must
have
been
something
queer
about
that
too
for
he
could
not
manage
to
read
a
single
word
of
it
without
actually
standing
right
in
the
book
itself
he
read
a
couple
of
lines
and
then
he
chanced
to
look
up
with
that
his
glance
fell
on
the
and
then
he
cried
aloud
look
there
another
one
for
in
the
glass
he
saw
plainly
a
little
little
creature
who
was
dressed
in
a
hood
and
leather
breeches
why
that
one
is
dressed
exactly
like
me
said
the
boy
and
clasped
his
hands
in
astonishment
but
then
he
saw
that
the
thing
in
the
mirror
did
the
same
thing
then
he
began
to
pull
his
hair
and
pinch
his
arms
and
swing
round
and
instantly
he
did
the
same
thing
after
him
he
who
was
seen
in
the
mirror
the
boy
ran
around
the
glass
several
times
to
see
if
there
was
a
little
man
hidden
behind
it
but
he
found
no
one
there
and
then
he
began
to
shake
with
terror
for
now
he
understood
that
the
elf
had
bewitched
him
and
that
the
creature
whose
image
he
saw
in
the
glass
was
he
himself
the
wild
geese
the
boy
simply
could
not
make
himself
believe
that
he
had
been
transformed
into
an
elf
it
ca
be
anything
but
a
dream
a
queer
fancy
thought
he
if
i
wait
a
few
moments
i
surely
be
turned
back
into
a
human
being
again
he
placed
himself
before
the
glass
and
closed
his
eyes
he
opened
them
again
after
a
couple
of
minutes
and
then
expected
to
find
that
it
had
all
passed
over
but
it
had
he
was
and
remained
just
as
little
in
other
respects
he
was
the
same
as
before
the
thin
hair
the
freckles
across
his
nose
the
patches
on
his
leather
breeches
and
the
darns
on
his
stockings
were
all
like
themselves
with
this
exception
that
they
had
become
diminished
no
it
would
do
no
good
for
him
to
stand
still
and
wait
of
this
he
was
certain
he
must
try
something
else
and
he
thought
the
wisest
thing
that
he
could
do
was
to
try
and
find
the
elf
and
make
his
peace
with
him
and
while
he
sought
he
cried
and
prayed
and
promised
everything
he
could
think
of
nevermore
would
he
break
his
word
to
anyone
never
again
would
he
be
naughty
and
never
never
would
he
fall
asleep
again
over
the
sermon
if
he
might
only
be
a
human
being
once
more
he
would
be
such
a
good
and
helpful
and
obedient
boy
but
no
matter
how
much
he
promised
it
did
not
help
him
the
least
little
bit
suddenly
he
remembered
that
he
had
heard
his
mother
say
all
the
tiny
folk
made
their
home
in
the
cowsheds
and
at
once
he
concluded
to
go
there
and
see
if
he
could
find
the
elf
it
was
a
lucky
thing
that
the
stood
partly
open
for
he
never
could
have
reached
the
bolt
and
opened
it
but
now
he
slipped
through
without
any
difficulty
when
he
came
out
in
the
hallway
he
looked
around
for
his
wooden
shoes
for
in
the
house
to
be
sure
he
had
gone
about
in
his
he
wondered
how
he
should
manage
with
these
big
clumsy
wooden
shoes
but
just
then
he
saw
a
pair
of
tiny
shoes
on
the
doorstep
when
he
observed
that
the
elf
had
been
so
thoughtful
that
he
had
also
bewitched
the
wooden
shoes
he
was
even
more
troubled
it
was
evidently
his
intention
that
this
affliction
should
last
a
long
time
on
the
wooden
in
front
of
the
cottage
hopped
a
gray
sparrow
he
had
hardly
set
eyes
on
the
boy
before
he
called
out
teetee
teetee
look
at
nils
look
at
thumbietot
look
at
nils
holgersson
thumbietot
instantly
both
the
geese
and
the
chickens
turned
and
stared
at
the
boy
and
then
they
set
up
a
fearful
cackling
crowed
the
rooster
good
enough
for
him
he
has
pulled
my
comb
ka
ka
kada
serves
him
right
cried
the
hens
and
with
that
they
kept
up
a
continuous
cackle
the
geese
got
together
in
a
tight
group
stuck
their
heads
together
and
asked
who
can
have
done
this
who
can
have
done
this
but
the
strangest
thing
of
all
was
that
the
boy
understood
what
they
said
he
was
so
astonished
that
he
stood
there
as
if
rooted
to
the
doorstep
and
listened
it
must
be
because
i
am
changed
into
an
elf
said
he
this
is
probably
why
i
understand
he
thought
it
was
unbearable
that
the
hens
would
not
stop
saying
that
it
served
him
right
he
threw
a
stone
at
them
and
shouted
shut
up
you
pack
but
it
had
occurred
to
him
before
that
he
was
no
longer
the
sort
of
boy
the
hens
need
fear
the
whole
henyard
made
a
rush
for
him
and
formed
a
ring
around
him
then
they
all
cried
at
once
ka
ka
kada
served
you
right
ka
ka
kada
served
you
right
the
boy
tried
to
get
away
but
the
chickens
ran
after
him
and
screamed
until
he
thought
he
lose
his
hearing
it
is
more
than
likely
that
he
never
could
have
gotten
away
from
them
if
the
house
cat
had
come
along
just
then
as
soon
as
the
chickens
saw
the
cat
they
quieted
down
and
pretended
to
be
thinking
of
nothing
else
than
just
to
scratch
in
the
earth
for
worms
immediately
the
boy
ran
up
to
the
cat
you
dear
pussy
said
he
you
must
know
all
the
corners
and
hiding
places
about
here
you
be
a
good
little
kitty
and
tell
me
where
i
can
find
the
elf
the
cat
did
not
reply
at
once
he
seated
himself
curled
his
tail
into
a
graceful
ring
around
his
paws
and
stared
at
the
boy
it
was
a
large
black
cat
with
one
white
spot
on
his
chest
his
fur
lay
sleek
and
soft
and
shone
in
the
sunlight
the
claws
were
drawn
in
and
the
eyes
were
a
dull
gray
with
just
a
little
narrow
dark
streak
down
the
centre
the
cat
looked
thoroughly
and
inoffensive
i
know
well
enough
where
the
elf
lives
he
said
in
a
soft
voice
but
that
does
say
that
i
going
to
tell
about
it
dear
pussy
you
must
tell
me
where
the
elf
lives
said
the
boy
you
see
how
he
has
bewitched
me
the
cat
opened
his
eyes
a
little
so
that
the
green
wickedness
began
to
shine
forth
he
spun
round
and
purred
with
satisfaction
before
he
replied
shall
i
perhaps
help
you
because
you
have
so
often
grabbed
me
by
the
tail
he
said
at
last
then
the
boy
was
furious
and
forgot
entirely
how
little
and
helpless
he
was
now
oh
i
can
pull
your
tail
again
i
can
said
he
and
ran
toward
the
cat
the
next
instant
the
cat
was
so
changed
that
the
boy
could
scarcely
believe
it
was
the
same
animal
every
separate
hair
on
his
body
stood
on
end
the
back
was
bent
the
legs
had
become
elongated
the
claws
scraped
the
ground
the
tail
had
grown
thick
and
short
the
ears
were
laid
back
the
mouth
was
frothy
and
the
eyes
were
wide
open
and
glistened
like
sparks
of
red
fire
the
boy
did
want
to
let
himself
be
scared
by
a
cat
and
he
took
a
step
forward
then
the
cat
made
one
spring
and
landed
right
on
the
boy
knocked
him
down
and
stood
over
him
his
forepaws
on
his
chest
and
his
jaws
wide
apart
over
his
throat
the
boy
felt
how
the
sharp
claws
sank
through
his
vest
and
shirt
and
into
his
skin
and
how
the
sharp
tickled
his
throat
he
shrieked
for
help
as
loudly
as
he
could
but
no
one
came
he
thought
surely
that
his
last
hour
had
come
then
he
felt
that
the
cat
drew
in
his
claws
and
let
go
the
hold
on
his
throat
there
he
said
that
will
do
now
i
let
you
go
this
time
for
my
mistress
sake
i
only
wanted
you
to
know
which
one
of
us
two
has
the
power
now
with
that
the
cat
walked
away
looking
as
smooth
and
pious
as
he
did
when
he
first
appeared
on
the
scene
the
boy
was
so
crestfallen
that
he
did
say
a
word
but
only
hurried
to
the
cowhouse
to
look
for
the
elf
there
were
not
more
than
three
cows
all
told
but
when
the
boy
came
in
there
was
such
a
bellowing
and
such
a
that
one
might
easily
have
believed
that
there
were
at
least
thirty
moo
moo
moo
bellowed
mayrose
it
is
well
there
is
such
a
thing
as
justice
in
this
world
moo
moo
moo
sang
the
three
of
them
in
unison
he
could
hear
what
they
said
for
each
one
tried
to
the
others
the
boy
wanted
to
ask
after
the
elf
but
he
could
make
himself
heard
because
the
cows
were
in
full
uproar
they
carried
on
as
they
used
to
do
when
he
let
a
strange
dog
in
on
them
they
kicked
with
their
hind
legs
shook
their
necks
stretched
their
heads
and
measured
the
distance
with
their
horns
come
here
you
said
mayrose
and
you
get
a
kick
that
you
forget
in
a
hurry
come
here
said
gold
lily
and
you
shall
dance
on
my
horns
come
here
and
you
shall
taste
how
it
felt
when
you
threw
your
wooden
shoes
at
me
as
you
did
last
summer
bawled
star
come
here
and
you
shall
be
repaid
for
that
wasp
you
let
loose
in
my
ear
growled
gold
lily
mayrose
was
the
oldest
and
the
wisest
of
them
and
she
was
the
very
maddest
come
here
said
she
that
i
may
pay
you
back
for
the
many
times
that
you
have
jerked
the
milk
pail
away
from
your
mother
and
for
all
the
snares
you
laid
for
her
when
she
came
carrying
the
milk
pails
and
for
all
the
tears
when
she
has
stood
here
and
wept
over
you
the
boy
wanted
to
tell
them
how
he
regretted
that
he
had
been
unkind
to
them
and
that
never
never
from
now
on
should
he
be
anything
but
good
if
they
would
only
tell
him
where
the
elf
was
but
the
cows
listen
to
him
they
made
such
a
racket
that
he
began
to
fear
one
of
them
would
succeed
in
breaking
loose
and
he
thought
that
the
best
thing
for
him
to
do
was
to
go
quietly
away
from
the
cowhouse
when
he
came
out
he
was
thoroughly
disheartened
he
could
understand
that
no
one
on
the
place
wanted
to
help
him
find
the
elf
and
little
good
would
it
do
him
probably
if
the
elf
were
found
he
crawled
up
on
the
broad
hedge
which
fenced
in
the
farm
and
which
was
overgrown
with
briers
and
lichen
there
he
sat
down
to
think
about
how
it
would
go
with
him
if
he
never
became
a
human
being
again
when
father
and
mother
came
home
from
church
there
would
be
a
surprise
for
them
yes
a
surprise
it
would
be
all
over
the
land
and
people
would
come
flocking
from
east
vemminghög
and
from
torp
and
from
skerup
the
whole
vemminghög
township
would
come
to
stare
at
him
perhaps
father
and
mother
would
take
him
with
them
and
show
him
at
the
market
place
in
kivik
no
that
was
too
horrible
to
think
about
he
would
rather
that
no
human
being
should
ever
see
him
again
his
unhappiness
was
simply
frightful
no
one
in
all
the
world
was
so
unhappy
as
he
he
was
no
longer
a
human
being
but
a
freak
little
by
little
he
began
to
comprehend
what
it
meant
to
be
no
longer
human
he
was
separated
from
everything
now
he
could
no
longer
play
with
other
boys
he
could
not
take
charge
of
the
farm
after
his
parents
were
gone
and
certainly
no
girl
would
think
of
marrying
he
sat
and
looked
at
his
home
it
was
a
little
log
house
which
lay
as
if
it
had
been
crushed
down
to
earth
under
the
high
sloping
roof
the
outhouses
were
also
small
and
the
patches
of
ground
were
so
narrow
that
a
horse
could
barely
turn
around
on
them
but
little
and
poor
though
the
place
was
it
was
much
too
good
for
him
he
could
ask
for
any
better
place
than
a
hole
under
the
stable
floor
it
was
wondrously
beautiful
weather
it
budded
and
it
rippled
and
it
murmured
and
it
twittered
all
around
him
but
he
sat
there
with
such
a
heavy
sorrow
he
should
never
be
happy
any
more
about
anything
never
had
he
seen
the
skies
as
blue
as
they
were
birds
of
passage
came
on
their
travels
they
came
from
foreign
lands
and
had
travelled
over
the
east
sea
by
way
of
smygahuk
and
were
now
on
their
way
north
they
were
of
many
different
kinds
but
he
was
only
familiar
with
the
wild
geese
who
came
flying
in
two
long
rows
which
met
at
an
angle
several
flocks
of
wild
geese
had
already
flown
by
they
flew
very
high
still
he
could
hear
how
they
shrieked
to
the
hills
now
we
off
to
the
hills
when
the
wild
geese
saw
the
tame
geese
who
walked
about
the
farm
they
sank
nearer
the
earth
and
called
come
along
come
along
we
off
to
the
hills
the
tame
geese
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
raise
their
heads
and
listen
but
they
answered
very
sensibly
we
pretty
well
off
where
we
are
we
pretty
well
off
where
we
are
it
was
as
we
have
said
an
uncommonly
fine
day
with
an
atmosphere
that
it
must
have
been
a
real
delight
to
fly
in
so
light
and
bracing
and
with
each
new
wild
that
flew
by
the
tame
geese
became
more
and
more
unruly
a
couple
of
times
they
flapped
their
wings
as
if
they
had
half
a
mind
to
fly
along
but
then
an
old
would
always
say
to
them
now
do
be
silly
those
creatures
will
have
to
suffer
both
hunger
and
cold
there
was
a
young
gander
whom
the
wild
geese
had
fired
with
a
passion
for
adventure
if
another
flock
comes
this
way
i
follow
them
said
he
then
there
came
a
new
flock
who
shrieked
like
the
others
and
the
young
gander
answered
wait
a
minute
wait
a
minute
i
coming
he
spread
his
wings
and
raised
himself
into
the
air
but
he
was
so
unaccustomed
to
flying
that
he
fell
to
the
ground
again
at
any
rate
the
wild
geese
must
have
heard
his
call
for
they
turned
and
flew
back
slowly
to
see
if
he
was
coming
wait
wait
he
cried
and
made
another
attempt
to
fly
all
this
the
boy
heard
where
he
lay
on
the
hedge
it
would
be
a
great
pity
thought
he
if
the
big
should
go
away
it
would
be
a
big
loss
to
father
and
mother
if
he
was
gone
when
they
came
home
from
church
when
he
thought
of
this
once
again
he
entirely
forgot
that
he
was
little
and
helpless
he
took
one
leap
right
down
into
the
and
threw
his
arms
around
the
neck
of
the
oh
no
you
do
fly
away
this
time
sir
cried
he
but
just
about
then
the
gander
was
considering
how
he
should
go
to
work
to
raise
himself
from
the
ground
he
could
stop
to
shake
the
boy
off
hence
he
had
to
go
along
with
him
up
in
the
air
they
bore
on
toward
the
heights
so
rapidly
that
the
boy
fairly
gasped
before
he
had
time
to
think
that
he
ought
to
let
go
his
hold
around
the
gander
neck
he
was
so
high
up
that
he
would
have
been
killed
instantly
if
he
had
fallen
to
the
ground
the
only
thing
that
he
could
do
to
make
himself
a
little
more
comfortable
was
to
try
and
get
upon
the
gander
back
and
there
he
wriggled
himself
forthwith
but
not
without
considerable
trouble
and
it
was
not
an
easy
matter
either
to
hold
himself
secure
on
the
slippery
back
between
two
swaying
wings
he
had
to
dig
deep
into
feathers
and
down
with
both
hands
to
keep
from
tumbling
to
the
ground
the
big
checked
cloth
the
boy
had
grown
so
giddy
that
it
was
a
long
while
before
he
came
to
himself
the
winds
howled
and
beat
against
him
and
the
rustle
of
feathers
and
swaying
of
wings
sounded
like
a
whole
storm
thirteen
geese
flew
around
him
flapping
their
wings
and
honking
they
danced
before
his
eyes
and
they
buzzed
in
his
ears
he
did
know
whether
they
flew
high
or
low
or
in
what
direction
they
were
travelling
after
a
bit
he
regained
just
enough
sense
to
understand
that
he
ought
to
find
out
where
the
geese
were
taking
him
but
this
was
not
so
easy
for
he
did
know
how
he
should
ever
muster
up
courage
enough
to
look
down
he
was
sure
he
faint
if
he
attempted
it
the
wild
geese
were
not
flying
very
high
because
the
new
travelling
companion
could
not
breathe
in
the
very
thinnest
air
for
his
sake
they
also
flew
a
little
slower
than
usual
at
last
the
boy
just
made
himself
cast
one
glance
down
to
earth
then
he
thought
that
a
great
big
rug
lay
spread
beneath
him
which
was
made
up
of
an
incredible
number
of
large
and
small
checks
where
in
all
the
world
am
i
now
he
wondered
he
saw
nothing
but
check
upon
check
some
were
broad
and
ran
crosswise
and
some
were
long
and
narrow
all
over
there
were
angles
and
corners
nothing
was
round
and
nothing
was
crooked
what
kind
of
a
big
checked
cloth
is
this
that
i
looking
down
on
said
the
boy
to
himself
without
expecting
anyone
to
answer
him
but
instantly
the
wild
geese
who
flew
about
him
called
out
fields
and
meadows
fields
and
meadows
then
he
understood
that
the
big
checked
cloth
he
was
travelling
over
was
the
flat
land
of
southern
sweden
and
he
began
to
comprehend
why
it
looked
so
checked
and
the
bright
green
checks
he
recognised
first
they
were
rye
fields
that
had
been
sown
in
the
fall
and
had
kept
themselves
green
under
the
winter
snows
the
checks
were
the
remains
of
the
which
had
grown
there
the
summer
before
the
brownish
ones
were
old
clover
meadows
and
the
black
ones
deserted
grazing
lands
or
fallow
pastures
the
brown
checks
with
the
yellow
edges
were
undoubtedly
forests
for
in
these
you
find
the
big
trees
which
grow
in
the
heart
of
the
forest
naked
in
winter
while
the
little
which
grow
along
the
borders
keep
their
dry
yellowed
leaves
way
into
the
spring
there
were
also
dark
checks
with
gray
centres
these
were
the
large
estates
encircled
by
the
small
cottages
with
their
blackening
straw
roofs
and
their
and
then
there
were
checks
green
in
the
middle
with
brown
borders
these
were
the
orchards
where
the
were
already
turning
green
although
the
trees
and
bushes
around
them
were
still
in
their
nude
brown
bark
the
boy
could
not
keep
from
laughing
when
he
saw
how
checked
everything
looked
but
when
the
wild
geese
heard
him
laugh
they
called
out
kind
reprovingly
fertile
and
good
land
fertile
and
good
land
the
boy
had
already
become
serious
to
think
that
you
can
laugh
you
who
have
met
with
the
most
terrible
misfortune
that
can
possibly
happen
to
a
human
being
thought
he
and
for
a
moment
he
was
pretty
serious
but
it
was
long
before
he
was
laughing
again
now
that
he
had
grown
somewhat
accustomed
to
the
ride
and
the
speed
so
that
he
could
think
of
something
besides
holding
himself
on
the
back
he
began
to
notice
how
full
the
air
was
of
birds
flying
northward
and
there
was
a
shouting
and
a
calling
from
flock
to
flock
so
you
came
over
shrieked
some
yes
answered
the
geese
how
do
you
think
the
spring
getting
on
not
a
leaf
on
the
trees
and
water
in
the
lakes
came
back
the
answer
when
the
geese
flew
over
a
place
where
they
saw
any
tame
fowl
they
shouted
what
the
name
of
this
place
what
the
name
of
this
place
then
the
roosters
cocked
their
heads
and
answered
its
name
lillgarde
this
year
the
same
as
last
year
most
of
the
cottages
were
probably
named
after
their
owners
which
is
the
custom
in
skåne
but
instead
of
saying
this
is
per
matssons
or
ola
bossons
the
roosters
hit
upon
the
kind
of
names
which
to
their
way
of
thinking
were
more
appropriate
those
who
lived
on
small
farms
and
belonged
to
poor
cottagers
cried
this
place
is
called
grainscarce
and
those
who
belonged
to
the
poorest
screamed
the
name
of
this
place
is
the
big
farms
got
names
from
the
roosters
such
as
luckymeadows
eggberga
and
moneyville
but
the
roosters
on
the
great
landed
estates
were
too
high
and
mighty
to
condescend
to
anything
like
jesting
one
of
them
crowed
and
called
out
with
such
gusto
that
it
sounded
as
if
he
wanted
to
be
heard
clear
up
to
the
sun
this
is
herr
dybeck
estate
the
same
this
year
as
last
year
this
year
as
last
year
a
little
further
on
strutted
one
rooster
who
crowed
this
is
swanholm
surely
all
the
world
knows
that
the
boy
observed
that
the
geese
did
not
fly
straight
forward
but
zigzagged
hither
and
thither
over
the
whole
south
country
just
as
though
they
were
glad
to
be
in
skåne
again
and
wanted
to
pay
their
respects
to
every
separate
place
they
came
to
one
place
where
there
were
a
number
of
big
buildings
with
great
tall
chimneys
and
all
around
these
were
a
lot
of
smaller
houses
this
is
jordberga
sugar
refinery
cried
the
roosters
the
boy
shuddered
as
he
sat
there
on
the
goose
back
he
ought
to
have
recognised
this
place
for
it
was
not
very
far
from
his
home
here
he
had
worked
the
year
before
as
a
watch
boy
but
to
be
sure
nothing
was
exactly
like
itself
when
one
saw
it
like
that
from
up
above
and
think
just
think
osa
the
goose
girl
and
little
mats
who
were
his
comrades
last
year
indeed
the
boy
would
have
been
glad
to
know
if
they
still
were
anywhere
about
here
fancy
what
they
would
have
said
had
they
suspected
that
he
was
flying
over
their
heads
soon
jordberga
was
lost
to
sight
and
they
travelled
towards
svedala
and
skaber
lake
and
back
again
over
görringe
cloister
and
häckeberga
the
boy
saw
more
of
skåne
in
this
one
day
than
he
had
ever
seen
before
in
all
the
years
that
he
had
lived
whenever
the
wild
geese
happened
across
any
tame
geese
they
had
the
best
fun
they
flew
forward
very
slowly
and
called
down
we
off
to
the
hills
are
you
coming
along
are
you
coming
along
but
the
tame
geese
answered
it
still
winter
in
this
country
out
too
soon
fly
back
fly
back
the
wild
geese
lowered
themselves
that
they
might
be
heard
a
little
better
and
called
come
along
we
teach
you
how
to
fly
and
swim
then
the
tame
geese
got
mad
and
would
answer
them
with
a
single
honk
the
wild
geese
sank
themselves
still
lower
until
they
almost
touched
the
ground
then
quick
as
lightning
they
raised
themselves
just
as
if
they
been
terribly
frightened
oh
oh
oh
they
exclaimed
those
things
were
not
geese
they
were
only
sheep
they
were
only
sheep
the
ones
on
the
ground
were
beside
themselves
with
rage
and
shrieked
may
you
be
shot
the
whole
lot
o
you
the
whole
lot
o
you
when
the
boy
heard
all
this
teasing
he
laughed
then
he
remembered
how
badly
things
had
gone
with
him
and
he
cried
but
the
next
second
he
was
laughing
again
never
before
had
he
ridden
so
fast
and
to
ride
fast
and
recklessly
that
he
had
always
liked
and
of
course
he
had
never
dreamed
that
it
could
be
as
fresh
and
bracing
as
it
was
up
in
the
air
or
that
there
rose
from
the
earth
such
a
fine
scent
of
resin
and
soil
nor
had
he
ever
dreamed
what
it
could
be
like
to
ride
so
high
above
the
earth
it
was
just
like
flying
away
from
sorrow
and
trouble
and
annoyances
of
every
kind
that
could
be
thought
of
akka
from
kebnekaise
evening
the
big
tame
that
had
followed
them
up
in
the
air
felt
very
proud
of
being
permitted
to
travel
back
and
forth
over
the
south
country
with
the
wild
geese
and
crack
jokes
with
the
tame
birds
but
in
spite
of
his
keen
delight
he
began
to
tire
as
the
afternoon
wore
on
he
tried
to
take
deeper
breaths
and
quicker
but
even
so
he
remained
several
behind
the
others
when
the
wild
geese
who
flew
last
noticed
that
the
tame
one
keep
up
with
them
they
began
to
call
to
the
goose
who
rode
in
the
centre
of
the
angle
and
led
the
procession
akka
from
kebnekaise
akka
from
kebnekaise
what
do
you
want
of
me
asked
the
leader
the
white
one
will
be
left
behind
the
white
one
will
be
left
behind
tell
him
it
easier
to
fly
fast
than
slow
called
the
leader
and
raced
on
as
before
the
certainly
tried
to
follow
the
advice
and
increase
his
speed
but
then
he
became
so
exhausted
that
he
sank
away
down
to
the
drooping
willows
that
bordered
the
fields
and
meadows
akka
akka
akka
from
kebnekaise
cried
those
who
flew
last
and
saw
what
a
hard
time
he
was
having
what
do
you
want
now
asked
the
leader
and
she
sounded
awfully
angry
the
white
one
sinks
to
the
earth
the
white
one
sinks
to
the
earth
tell
him
it
easier
to
fly
high
than
low
shouted
the
leader
and
she
did
slow
up
the
least
little
bit
but
raced
on
as
before
the
tried
also
to
follow
this
advice
but
when
he
wanted
to
raise
himself
he
became
so
winded
that
he
almost
burst
his
breast
akka
akka
again
cried
those
who
flew
last
ca
you
let
me
fly
in
peace
asked
the
leader
and
she
sounded
even
madder
than
before
the
white
one
is
ready
to
collapse
tell
him
that
he
who
has
not
the
strength
to
fly
with
the
flock
can
go
back
home
cried
the
leader
she
certainly
had
no
idea
of
decreasing
her
speed
but
raced
on
as
before
oh
is
that
the
way
the
wind
blows
thought
the
he
understood
at
once
that
the
wild
geese
had
never
intended
to
take
him
along
up
to
lapland
they
had
only
lured
him
away
from
home
in
sport
he
felt
thoroughly
exasperated
to
think
that
his
strength
should
fail
him
now
so
he
would
be
able
to
show
these
tramps
that
even
a
tame
goose
was
good
for
something
but
the
most
provoking
thing
of
all
was
that
he
had
fallen
in
with
akka
from
kebnekaise
tame
goose
that
he
was
he
had
heard
about
a
leader
goose
named
akka
who
was
more
than
a
hundred
years
old
she
had
such
a
big
name
that
the
best
wild
geese
in
the
world
followed
her
but
no
one
had
such
a
contempt
for
tame
geese
as
akka
and
her
flock
and
gladly
would
he
have
shown
them
that
he
was
their
equal
he
flew
slowly
behind
the
rest
while
he
deliberated
whether
he
should
turn
back
or
continue
finally
the
little
creature
that
he
carried
on
his
back
said
dear
morten
you
know
well
enough
that
it
is
simply
impossible
for
you
who
have
never
flown
to
go
with
the
wild
geese
all
the
way
up
to
lapland
wo
you
turn
back
before
you
kill
yourself
but
the
farmer
lad
was
about
the
worst
thing
the
knew
anything
about
and
as
soon
as
it
dawned
on
him
that
this
puny
creature
actually
believed
that
he
could
make
the
trip
he
decided
to
stick
it
out
if
you
say
another
word
about
this
i
drop
you
into
the
first
ditch
we
ride
over
said
he
and
at
the
same
time
his
fury
gave
him
so
much
strength
that
he
began
to
fly
almost
as
well
as
any
of
the
others
it
is
likely
that
he
could
have
kept
this
pace
up
very
long
neither
was
it
necessary
for
just
then
the
sun
sank
quickly
and
at
sunset
the
geese
flew
down
and
before
the
boy
and
the
knew
what
had
happened
they
stood
on
the
shores
of
vomb
lake
they
probably
intend
that
we
shall
spend
the
night
here
thought
the
boy
and
jumped
down
from
the
goose
back
he
stood
on
a
narrow
beach
by
a
lake
it
was
ugly
to
look
upon
because
it
was
almost
entirely
covered
with
an
that
was
blackened
and
uneven
and
full
of
cracks
and
holes
as
spring
ice
generally
is
the
ice
was
already
breaking
up
it
was
loose
and
floating
and
had
a
broad
belt
of
dark
shiny
water
all
around
it
but
there
was
still
enough
of
it
left
to
spread
chill
and
winter
terror
over
the
place
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
there
appeared
to
be
an
open
and
light
country
but
where
the
geese
had
lighted
there
was
a
thick
it
looked
as
if
the
forest
of
firs
and
pines
had
the
power
to
bind
the
winter
to
itself
everywhere
else
the
ground
was
bare
but
beneath
the
sharp
lay
snow
that
had
been
melting
and
freezing
melting
and
freezing
until
it
was
hard
as
ice
the
boy
thought
he
had
struck
an
arctic
wilderness
and
he
was
so
miserable
that
he
wanted
to
scream
he
was
hungry
too
he
had
eaten
a
bite
the
whole
day
but
where
should
he
find
any
food
nothing
eatable
grew
on
either
ground
or
tree
in
the
month
of
march
yes
where
was
he
to
find
food
and
who
would
give
him
shelter
and
who
would
fix
his
bed
and
who
would
protect
him
from
the
wild
beasts
for
now
the
sun
was
away
and
frost
came
from
the
lake
and
darkness
sank
down
from
heaven
and
terror
stole
forward
on
the
twilight
trail
and
in
the
forest
it
began
to
patter
and
rustle
now
the
good
humour
which
the
boy
had
felt
when
he
was
up
in
the
air
was
gone
and
in
his
misery
he
looked
around
for
his
travelling
companions
he
had
no
one
but
them
to
cling
to
now
then
he
saw
that
the
was
having
even
a
worse
time
of
it
than
he
he
was
lying
prostrate
on
the
spot
where
he
had
alighted
and
it
looked
as
if
he
were
ready
to
die
his
neck
lay
flat
against
the
ground
his
eyes
were
closed
and
his
breathing
sounded
like
a
feeble
hissing
dear
morten
said
the
boy
try
to
get
a
swallow
of
water
it
is
two
steps
to
the
lake
but
the
did
stir
the
boy
had
certainly
been
cruel
to
all
animals
and
to
the
in
times
gone
by
but
now
he
felt
that
the
was
the
only
comfort
he
had
left
and
he
was
dreadfully
afraid
of
losing
him
at
once
the
boy
began
to
push
and
drag
him
to
get
him
into
the
water
but
the
was
big
and
heavy
and
it
was
mighty
hard
work
for
the
boy
but
at
last
he
succeeded
the
got
in
head
first
for
an
instant
he
lay
motionless
in
the
slime
but
soon
he
poked
up
his
head
shook
the
water
from
his
eyes
and
sniffed
then
he
swam
proudly
between
reeds
and
seaweed
the
wild
geese
were
in
the
lake
before
him
they
had
not
looked
around
for
either
the
or
for
his
rider
but
had
made
straight
for
the
water
they
had
bathed
and
primped
and
now
they
lay
and
gulped
and
the
white
had
the
good
fortune
to
spy
a
perch
he
grabbed
it
quickly
swam
ashore
with
it
and
laid
it
down
in
front
of
the
boy
here
a
thank
you
for
helping
me
into
the
water
said
he
it
was
the
first
time
the
boy
had
heard
a
friendly
word
that
day
he
was
so
happy
that
he
wanted
to
throw
his
arms
around
the
neck
but
he
refrained
and
he
was
also
thankful
for
the
gift
at
first
he
must
have
thought
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
eat
raw
fish
and
then
he
had
a
notion
to
try
it
he
felt
to
see
if
he
still
had
his
with
him
and
sure
enough
there
it
hung
on
the
back
button
of
his
trousers
although
it
was
so
diminished
that
it
was
hardly
as
long
as
a
match
well
at
any
rate
it
served
to
scale
and
cleanse
fish
with
and
it
was
long
before
the
perch
was
eaten
when
the
boy
had
satisfied
his
hunger
he
felt
a
little
ashamed
because
he
had
been
able
to
eat
a
raw
thing
it
evident
that
i
not
a
human
being
any
longer
but
a
real
elf
thought
he
while
the
boy
ate
the
stood
silently
beside
him
but
when
he
had
swallowed
the
last
bite
he
said
in
a
low
voice
it
a
fact
that
we
have
run
across
a
goose
folk
who
despise
all
tame
birds
yes
i
observed
that
said
the
boy
what
a
triumph
it
would
be
for
me
if
i
could
follow
them
clear
up
to
lapland
and
show
them
that
even
a
tame
goose
can
do
things
said
the
boy
and
drawled
it
out
because
he
did
believe
the
could
ever
do
it
yet
he
did
wish
to
contradict
him
but
i
do
think
i
can
get
along
all
alone
on
such
a
journey
said
the
i
like
to
ask
if
you
could
come
along
and
help
me
the
boy
of
course
had
expected
anything
but
to
return
to
his
home
as
soon
as
possible
and
he
was
so
surprised
that
he
hardly
knew
what
he
should
reply
i
thought
that
we
were
enemies
you
and
i
said
he
but
this
the
seemed
to
have
forgotten
entirely
he
only
remembered
that
the
boy
had
but
just
saved
his
life
i
suppose
i
really
ought
to
go
home
to
father
and
mother
said
the
boy
oh
i
get
you
back
to
them
some
time
in
the
fall
said
the
i
shall
not
leave
you
until
i
put
you
down
on
your
own
doorstep
the
boy
thought
it
might
be
just
as
well
for
him
if
he
escaped
showing
himself
before
his
parents
for
a
while
he
was
not
disinclined
to
favour
the
scheme
and
was
just
on
the
point
of
saying
that
he
agreed
to
it
when
they
heard
a
loud
rumbling
behind
them
it
was
the
wild
geese
who
had
come
up
from
the
lake
all
at
one
time
and
stood
shaking
the
water
from
their
backs
after
that
they
arranged
themselves
in
a
long
row
with
the
in
the
centre
and
came
toward
them
as
the
white
sized
up
the
wild
geese
he
felt
ill
at
ease
he
had
expected
that
they
should
be
more
like
tame
geese
and
that
he
should
feel
a
closer
kinship
with
them
they
were
much
smaller
than
he
and
none
of
them
were
white
they
were
all
gray
with
a
sprinkling
of
brown
he
was
almost
afraid
of
their
eyes
they
were
yellow
and
shone
as
if
a
fire
had
been
kindled
back
of
them
the
had
always
been
taught
that
it
was
most
fitting
to
move
slowly
and
with
a
rolling
motion
but
these
creatures
did
not
walk
they
half
ran
he
grew
most
alarmed
however
when
he
looked
at
their
feet
these
were
large
and
the
soles
were
torn
and
it
was
evident
that
the
wild
geese
never
questioned
what
they
tramped
upon
they
took
no
they
were
very
neat
and
well
cared
for
in
other
respects
but
one
could
see
by
their
feet
that
they
were
poor
the
only
had
time
to
whisper
to
the
boy
speak
up
quickly
for
yourself
but
do
tell
them
who
you
are
before
the
geese
were
upon
them
when
the
wild
geese
had
stopped
in
front
of
them
they
curtsied
with
their
necks
many
times
and
the
did
likewise
many
more
times
as
soon
as
the
ceremonies
were
over
the
said
now
i
presume
we
shall
hear
what
kind
of
creatures
you
are
there
is
much
to
tell
about
me
said
the
i
was
born
in
skanor
last
spring
in
the
fall
i
was
sold
to
holger
nilsson
of
west
vemminghög
and
there
i
have
lived
ever
since
you
do
seem
to
have
any
pedigree
to
boast
of
said
the
what
is
it
then
that
makes
you
so
that
you
wish
to
associate
with
wild
geese
it
may
be
because
i
want
to
show
you
wild
geese
that
we
tame
ones
may
also
be
good
for
something
said
the
yes
it
would
be
well
if
you
could
show
us
that
said
the
we
have
already
observed
how
much
you
know
about
flying
but
you
are
more
skilled
perhaps
in
other
sports
possibly
you
are
strong
in
a
swimming
match
no
i
ca
boast
that
i
am
said
the
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
had
already
made
up
her
mind
to
send
him
home
so
he
did
much
care
how
he
answered
i
never
swam
any
farther
than
across
a
he
continued
then
i
presume
you
a
crack
sprinter
said
the
goose
i
have
never
seen
a
tame
goose
run
nor
have
i
ever
done
it
myself
said
the
and
he
made
things
appear
much
worse
than
they
really
were
the
big
white
one
was
sure
now
that
the
would
say
that
under
no
circumstances
could
they
take
him
along
he
was
very
much
astonished
when
she
said
you
answer
questions
courageously
and
he
who
has
courage
can
become
a
good
travelling
companion
even
if
he
is
ignorant
in
the
beginning
what
do
you
say
to
stopping
with
us
for
a
couple
of
days
until
we
can
see
what
you
are
good
for
that
suits
me
said
the
and
he
was
thoroughly
happy
thereupon
the
pointed
with
her
bill
and
said
but
who
is
that
you
have
with
you
i
never
seen
anything
like
him
before
that
my
comrade
said
the
he
been
a
all
his
life
he
be
useful
all
right
to
take
with
us
on
the
trip
yes
he
may
be
all
right
for
a
tame
goose
answered
the
wild
one
what
do
you
call
him
he
has
several
names
said
the
hesitantly
not
knowing
what
he
should
hit
upon
in
a
hurry
for
he
did
want
to
reveal
the
fact
that
the
boy
had
a
human
name
oh
his
name
is
thumbietot
he
said
at
last
does
he
belong
to
the
elf
family
asked
the
at
what
time
do
you
wild
geese
usually
retire
said
the
quickly
trying
to
evade
that
last
question
my
eyes
close
of
their
own
accord
about
this
time
one
could
easily
see
that
the
goose
who
talked
with
the
gander
was
very
old
her
entire
feather
outfit
was
without
any
dark
streaks
the
head
was
larger
the
legs
coarser
and
the
feet
were
more
worn
than
any
of
the
others
the
feathers
were
stiff
the
shoulders
knotty
the
neck
thin
all
this
was
due
to
age
it
was
only
upon
the
eyes
that
time
had
had
no
effect
they
shone
brighter
as
if
they
were
younger
than
any
of
the
others
she
turned
very
haughtily
toward
the
understand
that
i
am
akka
from
kebnekaise
and
that
the
goose
who
flies
nearest
me
to
the
right
is
iksi
from
vassijaure
and
the
one
to
the
left
is
kaksi
from
nuolja
understand
also
that
the
second
goose
is
kolmi
from
sarjektjakko
and
the
second
left
is
neljä
from
svappavaara
and
behind
them
fly
viisi
from
oviksfjällen
and
kuusi
from
sjangeli
and
know
that
these
as
well
as
the
six
goslings
who
fly
last
three
to
the
right
and
three
to
the
left
are
all
high
mountain
geese
of
the
finest
breed
you
must
not
take
us
for
who
strike
up
a
chance
acquaintance
with
any
and
everyone
and
you
must
not
think
that
we
permit
anyone
to
share
our
quarters
that
will
not
tell
us
who
his
ancestors
were
when
akka
the
talked
in
this
way
the
boy
stepped
briskly
forward
it
had
distressed
him
that
the
who
had
spoken
up
so
glibly
for
himself
should
give
such
evasive
answers
when
it
concerned
him
i
do
care
to
make
a
secret
of
who
i
am
said
he
my
name
is
nils
holgersson
i
a
farmer
son
and
until
i
have
been
a
human
being
but
this
morning
he
got
no
further
as
soon
as
he
had
said
that
he
was
human
the
staggered
three
steps
backward
and
the
rest
of
them
even
farther
back
they
all
extended
their
necks
and
hissed
angrily
at
him
i
have
suspected
this
ever
since
i
first
saw
you
here
on
these
shores
said
akka
and
now
you
can
clear
out
of
here
at
once
we
tolerate
no
human
beings
among
us
it
is
possible
said
the
meditatively
that
you
wild
geese
can
be
afraid
of
anyone
who
is
so
tiny
by
of
course
he
turn
back
home
you
can
surely
let
him
stay
with
us
overnight
none
of
us
can
afford
to
let
such
a
poor
little
creature
wander
off
by
himself
in
the
night
among
weasels
and
foxes
the
wild
goose
came
nearer
but
it
was
evident
that
it
was
hard
for
her
to
master
her
fear
i
have
been
taught
to
fear
everything
in
human
shape
be
it
big
or
little
said
she
but
if
you
will
answer
for
this
one
and
swear
that
he
will
not
harm
us
he
can
stay
with
us
but
i
do
believe
our
night
quarters
are
suitable
either
for
him
or
you
for
we
intend
to
roost
on
the
broken
ice
out
here
she
thought
of
course
that
the
would
be
doubtful
when
he
heard
this
but
he
never
let
on
she
is
pretty
wise
who
knows
how
to
choose
such
a
safe
bed
said
he
you
will
be
answerable
for
his
return
to
his
own
then
i
too
will
have
to
leave
you
said
the
i
have
sworn
that
i
would
not
forsake
him
you
are
free
to
fly
whither
you
will
said
the
with
this
she
raised
her
wings
and
flew
out
over
the
ice
and
one
after
another
the
wild
geese
followed
her
the
boy
was
very
sad
to
think
that
his
trip
to
lapland
would
not
come
off
and
in
the
bargain
he
was
afraid
of
the
chilly
night
quarters
it
will
be
worse
and
worse
said
he
in
the
first
place
we
freeze
to
death
on
the
ice
but
the
gander
was
in
a
good
humour
there
no
danger
said
he
only
make
haste
i
beg
of
you
and
gather
together
as
much
grass
and
litter
as
you
can
well
carry
when
the
boy
had
his
arms
full
of
dried
grass
the
grabbed
him
by
the
lifted
him
and
flew
out
on
the
ice
where
the
wild
geese
were
already
fast
asleep
with
their
bills
tucked
under
their
wings
now
spread
out
the
grass
on
the
ice
so
there
be
something
to
stand
on
to
keep
me
from
freezing
fast
you
help
me
and
i
help
you
said
the
this
the
boy
did
and
when
he
had
finished
the
picked
him
up
once
again
by
the
and
tucked
him
under
his
wing
i
think
you
lie
snug
and
warm
there
said
the
as
he
covered
him
with
his
wing
the
boy
was
so
imbedded
in
down
that
he
could
answer
and
he
was
nice
and
comfy
oh
but
he
was
tired
and
in
less
than
two
winks
he
was
fast
asleep
night
it
is
a
fact
that
ice
is
always
treacherous
and
not
to
be
trusted
in
the
middle
of
the
night
the
loosened
on
vomb
lake
moved
about
until
one
corner
of
it
touched
the
shore
now
it
happened
that
smirre
fox
who
lived
at
this
time
in
övid
cloister
park
on
the
east
side
of
the
lake
caught
a
glimpse
of
that
one
corner
while
he
was
out
on
his
night
chase
smirre
had
seen
the
wild
geese
early
in
the
evening
and
had
dared
to
hope
that
he
might
get
at
one
of
them
but
now
he
walked
right
out
on
the
ice
when
smirre
was
very
near
to
the
geese
his
claws
scraped
the
ice
and
the
geese
awoke
flapped
their
wings
and
prepared
for
flight
but
smirre
was
too
quick
for
them
he
darted
forward
as
though
he
been
shot
grabbed
a
goose
by
the
wing
and
ran
toward
land
again
but
this
night
the
wild
geese
were
not
alone
on
the
ice
for
they
had
a
human
being
among
them
little
as
he
was
the
boy
had
awakened
when
the
spread
his
wings
he
had
tumbled
down
on
the
ice
and
was
sitting
there
dazed
he
had
grasped
the
whys
and
wherefores
of
all
this
confusion
until
he
caught
sight
of
a
little
dog
who
ran
over
the
ice
with
a
goose
in
his
mouth
in
a
minute
the
boy
was
after
that
dog
to
try
and
take
the
goose
away
from
him
he
must
have
heard
the
call
to
him
have
a
care
thumbietot
have
a
care
but
the
boy
thought
that
such
a
little
runt
of
a
dog
was
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
and
he
rushed
ahead
the
wild
goose
that
smirre
fox
tugged
after
him
heard
the
clatter
as
the
boy
wooden
shoes
beat
against
the
ice
and
she
could
hardly
believe
her
ears
does
that
infant
think
he
can
take
me
away
from
the
fox
she
wondered
and
in
spite
of
her
misery
she
began
to
cackle
right
merrily
deep
down
in
her
windpipe
it
was
almost
as
if
she
had
laughed
the
first
thing
he
knows
he
fall
through
a
crack
in
the
ice
thought
she
but
dark
as
the
night
was
the
boy
saw
distinctly
all
the
cracks
and
holes
there
were
and
took
daring
leaps
over
them
this
was
because
he
had
the
elf
good
eyesight
now
and
could
see
in
the
dark
he
saw
both
lake
and
shore
just
as
clearly
as
if
it
had
been
daylight
smirre
fox
left
the
ice
where
it
touched
the
shore
and
just
as
he
was
working
his
way
up
to
the
the
boy
shouted
drop
that
goose
you
sneak
smirre
did
know
who
was
calling
to
him
and
wasted
no
time
in
looking
around
but
increased
his
pace
the
fox
made
straight
for
the
forest
and
the
boy
followed
him
with
never
a
thought
of
the
danger
he
was
running
all
he
thought
about
was
the
contemptuous
way
in
which
he
had
been
received
by
the
wild
geese
and
he
made
up
his
mind
to
let
them
see
that
a
human
being
was
something
higher
than
all
else
created
he
shouted
again
and
again
to
that
dog
to
make
him
drop
his
game
what
kind
of
a
dog
are
you
who
can
steal
a
whole
goose
and
not
feel
ashamed
of
yourself
drop
her
at
once
or
you
see
what
a
beating
you
get
drop
her
i
say
or
i
tell
your
master
how
you
behave
when
smirre
fox
saw
that
he
had
been
mistaken
for
a
scary
dog
he
was
so
amused
that
he
came
near
dropping
the
goose
smirre
was
a
great
plunderer
who
was
satisfied
with
only
hunting
rats
and
pigeons
in
the
fields
but
he
also
ventured
into
the
farmyards
to
steal
chickens
and
geese
he
knew
that
he
was
feared
throughout
the
district
and
anything
as
idiotic
as
this
he
had
not
heard
since
he
was
a
baby
the
boy
ran
so
fast
that
the
thick
appeared
to
be
running
past
him
backward
but
he
caught
up
with
smirre
finally
he
was
so
close
to
him
that
he
got
a
hold
on
his
tail
now
i
take
the
goose
from
you
anyway
cried
he
and
held
on
as
hard
as
ever
he
could
but
he
had
strength
enough
to
stop
smirre
the
fox
dragged
him
along
until
the
dry
foliage
whirled
around
him
but
now
it
began
to
dawn
on
smirre
how
harmless
the
thing
was
that
pursued
him
he
stopped
short
put
the
goose
on
the
ground
and
stood
on
her
with
his
forepaws
so
she
could
fly
away
he
was
just
about
to
bite
off
her
neck
but
then
he
could
resist
the
desire
to
tease
the
boy
a
little
hurry
off
and
complain
to
the
master
for
now
i
going
to
bite
the
goose
to
death
said
he
certainly
the
one
who
was
surprised
when
he
saw
what
a
pointed
nose
and
heard
what
a
hoarse
and
angry
voice
that
dog
which
he
was
pursuing
had
was
the
boy
but
now
he
was
so
enraged
because
the
fox
had
made
fun
of
him
that
he
never
thought
of
being
frightened
he
took
a
firmer
hold
on
the
tail
braced
himself
against
a
beech
trunk
and
just
as
the
fox
opened
his
jaws
over
the
goose
throat
he
pulled
as
hard
as
he
could
smirre
was
so
astonished
that
he
let
himself
be
pulled
backward
a
couple
of
steps
and
the
wild
goose
got
away
she
fluttered
upward
feebly
and
heavily
one
wing
was
so
badly
wounded
that
she
could
barely
use
it
in
addition
to
this
she
could
not
see
in
the
night
darkness
of
the
forest
but
was
as
helpless
as
the
blind
therefore
she
could
in
no
way
help
the
boy
so
she
groped
her
way
through
the
branches
and
flew
down
to
the
lake
again
then
smirre
made
a
dash
for
the
boy
if
i
do
get
the
one
i
shall
certainly
have
the
other
said
he
and
you
could
tell
by
his
voice
how
mad
he
was
oh
do
you
believe
it
said
the
boy
who
was
in
the
best
of
spirits
because
he
had
saved
the
goose
he
held
fast
by
the
and
swung
with
it
to
one
side
when
the
fox
tried
to
catch
him
there
was
such
a
dance
in
that
forest
that
the
dry
fairly
flew
smirre
swung
round
and
round
but
the
tail
swung
too
while
the
boy
kept
a
tight
grip
on
it
so
the
fox
could
not
grab
him
the
boy
was
so
gay
after
his
success
that
in
the
beginning
he
laughed
and
made
fun
of
the
fox
but
smirre
was
persevering
as
old
hunters
generally
are
and
the
boy
began
to
fear
that
he
should
be
captured
in
the
end
then
he
caught
sight
of
a
little
young
that
had
shot
up
as
slender
as
a
rod
that
it
might
soon
reach
the
free
air
above
the
canopy
of
branches
which
the
old
beeches
spread
above
it
quick
as
a
flash
he
let
go
of
the
and
climbed
the
beech
tree
smirre
fox
was
so
excited
that
he
continued
to
dance
around
after
his
tail
do
bother
with
the
dance
any
longer
said
the
boy
but
smirre
could
endure
the
humiliation
of
his
failure
to
get
the
better
of
such
a
little
tot
so
he
lay
down
under
the
tree
that
he
might
keep
a
close
watch
on
him
the
boy
did
have
any
too
good
a
time
of
it
where
he
sat
astride
a
frail
branch
the
young
beech
did
not
as
yet
reach
the
high
so
the
boy
could
get
over
to
another
tree
and
he
did
dare
to
come
down
again
he
was
so
cold
and
numb
that
he
almost
lost
his
hold
around
the
branch
and
he
was
dreadfully
sleepy
but
he
did
dare
fall
asleep
for
fear
of
tumbling
down
my
but
it
was
dismal
to
sit
in
that
way
the
whole
night
through
out
in
the
forest
he
never
before
understood
the
real
meaning
of
night
it
was
just
as
if
the
whole
world
had
become
petrified
and
never
could
come
to
life
again
then
it
commenced
to
dawn
the
boy
was
glad
that
everything
began
to
look
like
itself
once
more
although
the
chill
was
even
sharper
than
it
had
been
during
the
night
finally
when
the
sun
got
up
it
was
yellow
but
red
the
boy
thought
it
looked
as
though
it
were
angry
and
he
wondered
what
it
was
angry
about
perhaps
it
was
because
the
night
had
made
it
so
cold
and
gloomy
on
earth
while
the
sun
was
away
the
sunbeams
came
down
in
great
clusters
to
see
what
the
night
had
been
up
to
it
could
be
seen
how
everything
blushed
as
if
they
all
had
guilty
consciences
the
clouds
in
the
skies
the
satiny
the
little
intertwined
branches
of
the
the
that
covered
the
foliage
on
the
ground
everything
grew
flushed
and
red
more
and
more
sunbeams
came
bursting
through
space
and
soon
the
terrors
were
driven
away
and
such
a
marvellous
lot
of
living
things
came
forward
the
black
woodpecker
with
the
red
neck
began
to
hammer
with
its
bill
on
the
branch
the
squirrel
glided
from
his
nest
with
a
nut
and
sat
down
on
a
branch
and
began
to
shell
it
the
starling
came
flying
with
a
worm
and
the
bulfinch
sang
in
the
then
the
boy
understood
that
the
sun
had
said
to
all
these
tiny
creatures
wake
up
now
and
come
out
of
your
nests
i
here
now
you
need
be
afraid
of
nothing
the
call
was
heard
from
the
lake
as
they
were
preparing
for
flight
and
soon
all
fourteen
geese
came
flying
through
the
forest
the
boy
tried
to
call
to
them
but
they
flew
so
high
that
his
voice
reach
them
they
probably
believed
the
fox
had
eaten
him
up
and
they
did
trouble
themselves
to
look
for
him
the
boy
came
near
crying
with
regret
but
the
sun
stood
up
there
and
happy
and
put
courage
into
the
whole
world
it
is
worth
while
nils
holgersson
for
you
to
be
troubled
about
anything
as
long
as
i
here
said
the
sun
march
everything
remained
unchanged
in
the
forest
about
as
long
as
it
takes
a
goose
to
eat
her
breakfast
but
just
as
the
morning
was
verging
on
forenoon
a
goose
came
flying
all
by
herself
under
the
thick
she
groped
her
way
hesitatingly
between
the
stems
and
branches
and
flew
very
slowly
as
soon
as
smirre
fox
saw
her
he
left
his
place
under
the
beech
tree
and
sneaked
up
toward
her
the
wild
goose
did
avoid
the
fox
but
flew
very
close
to
him
smirre
made
a
high
jump
for
her
but
he
missed
her
and
the
goose
went
on
her
way
down
to
the
lake
it
was
not
long
before
another
goose
came
flying
she
took
the
same
route
as
the
first
one
and
flew
still
lower
and
slower
she
too
flew
close
to
smirre
fox
and
he
made
such
a
high
spring
for
her
that
his
ears
brushed
her
feet
but
she
too
got
away
from
him
unhurt
and
went
her
way
toward
the
lake
silent
as
a
shadow
a
little
while
passed
and
then
there
came
another
wild
goose
she
flew
still
slower
and
lower
and
it
seemed
even
more
difficult
for
her
to
find
her
way
between
the
smirre
made
a
powerful
spring
he
was
within
a
hair
breadth
of
catching
her
but
that
goose
also
managed
to
save
herself
just
after
she
had
disappeared
came
a
fourth
she
flew
so
slowly
and
so
badly
that
smirre
fox
thought
he
could
catch
her
without
much
effort
but
he
was
afraid
of
failure
now
and
concluded
to
let
her
fly
past
unmolested
she
took
the
same
direction
the
others
had
taken
and
just
as
she
was
come
right
above
smirre
she
sank
down
so
far
that
he
was
tempted
to
jump
for
her
he
jumped
so
high
that
he
touched
her
with
his
tail
but
she
flung
herself
quickly
to
one
side
and
saved
her
life
before
smirre
got
through
panting
three
more
geese
came
flying
in
a
row
they
flew
just
like
the
rest
and
smirre
made
high
springs
for
them
all
but
he
did
not
succeed
in
catching
any
one
of
them
after
that
came
five
geese
but
these
flew
better
than
the
others
and
although
it
seemed
as
if
they
wanted
to
lure
smirre
to
jump
he
withstood
the
temptation
after
quite
a
long
time
came
one
single
goose
it
was
the
thirteenth
this
one
was
so
old
that
she
was
gray
all
over
without
a
dark
speck
anywhere
on
her
body
she
did
appear
to
use
one
wing
very
well
but
flew
so
wretchedly
and
crookedly
that
she
almost
touched
the
ground
smirre
not
only
made
a
high
leap
for
her
but
he
pursued
her
running
and
jumping
all
the
way
down
to
the
lake
but
not
even
this
time
did
he
get
anything
for
his
trouble
when
the
fourteenth
goose
came
along
it
looked
very
pretty
because
it
was
white
and
as
its
great
wings
swayed
it
glistened
like
a
light
in
the
dark
forest
when
smirre
fox
saw
this
one
he
mustered
all
his
resources
and
jumped
up
to
the
but
the
white
one
flew
by
unhurt
like
the
rest
now
it
was
quiet
for
a
moment
under
the
beeches
it
looked
as
if
the
whole
had
travelled
past
suddenly
smirre
remembered
his
prisoner
and
raised
his
eyes
toward
the
young
and
just
as
he
might
have
expected
the
boy
had
disappeared
but
smirre
did
have
much
time
to
think
about
him
for
now
the
first
goose
came
back
again
from
the
lake
and
flew
slowly
under
the
canopy
in
spite
of
all
his
ill
luck
smirre
was
glad
that
she
came
back
and
darted
after
her
with
a
high
leap
but
he
had
been
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
and
had
taken
the
time
to
calculate
the
distance
and
he
landed
at
one
side
of
the
goose
then
there
came
still
another
goose
then
a
third
a
fourth
a
fifth
and
so
on
until
the
angle
closed
in
with
the
old
one
and
the
big
white
one
they
all
flew
low
and
slow
just
as
they
swayed
in
the
vicinity
of
smirre
fox
they
sank
down
kind
of
for
him
to
take
them
smirre
ran
after
them
and
made
leaps
a
couple
of
fathoms
high
but
he
could
manage
to
get
hold
of
a
single
one
of
them
it
was
the
most
awful
day
that
smirre
fox
had
ever
experienced
the
wild
geese
kept
on
travelling
over
his
head
they
came
and
went
came
and
went
great
splendid
geese
who
had
eaten
themselves
fat
on
the
german
heaths
and
grain
fields
swayed
all
day
through
the
woods
and
so
close
to
him
that
he
touched
them
many
times
yet
he
was
not
permitted
to
appease
his
hunger
with
a
single
one
of
them
the
winter
was
hardly
gone
yet
and
smirre
recalled
nights
and
days
when
he
had
been
forced
to
tramp
around
in
idleness
with
not
so
much
as
a
hare
to
hunt
when
the
rats
hid
themselves
under
the
frozen
earth
and
when
the
chickens
were
all
shut
up
but
all
the
winter
hunger
had
not
been
as
hard
to
endure
as
this
day
miscalculations
smirre
was
no
young
fox
he
had
had
the
dogs
after
him
many
a
time
and
had
heard
the
bullets
whizz
around
his
ears
he
had
lain
in
hiding
down
in
the
lair
while
the
dachshunds
crept
into
the
crevices
and
all
but
found
him
but
all
the
anguish
that
smirre
fox
had
been
forced
to
suffer
under
this
hot
chase
was
not
to
be
compared
with
what
he
suffered
every
time
that
he
missed
one
of
the
wild
geese
in
the
morning
when
the
play
began
smirre
fox
had
looked
so
stunning
that
the
geese
were
amazed
when
they
saw
him
smirre
loved
display
his
coat
was
a
brilliant
red
his
breast
white
his
nose
black
and
his
tail
was
as
bushy
as
a
plume
but
when
the
evening
of
this
day
was
come
smirre
coat
hung
in
loose
folds
he
was
bathed
in
sweat
his
eyes
were
without
lustre
his
tongue
hung
far
out
from
his
gaping
jaws
and
froth
oozed
from
his
mouth
in
the
afternoon
smirre
was
so
exhausted
that
he
grew
delirious
he
saw
nothing
before
his
eyes
but
flying
geese
he
made
leaps
for
which
he
saw
on
the
ground
and
for
a
poor
little
butterfly
that
had
come
out
of
his
chrysalis
too
soon
the
wild
geese
flew
and
flew
unceasingly
all
day
long
they
continued
to
torment
smirre
they
were
not
moved
to
pity
because
smirre
was
done
up
fevered
and
out
of
his
head
they
continued
without
a
although
they
understood
that
he
hardly
saw
them
and
that
he
jumped
after
their
shadows
when
smirre
fox
sank
down
on
a
pile
of
dry
leaves
weak
and
powerless
and
almost
ready
to
give
up
the
ghost
they
stopped
teasing
him
now
you
know
fox
what
happens
to
the
one
who
dares
to
come
near
akka
of
kebnekaise
they
shouted
in
his
ear
and
with
that
they
left
him
in
peace
the
wonderful
journey
of
nils
on
the
farm
march
just
at
that
time
a
thing
happened
in
skåne
which
created
a
good
deal
of
discussion
and
even
got
into
the
newspapers
but
which
many
believed
to
be
a
fable
because
they
had
not
been
able
to
explain
it
it
was
about
like
this
a
lady
squirrel
had
been
captured
in
the
hazelbrush
that
grew
on
the
shores
of
vomb
lake
and
was
carried
to
a
farmhouse
close
by
all
the
folks
on
the
farm
both
young
and
old
were
delighted
with
the
pretty
creature
with
the
bushy
tail
the
wise
inquisitive
eyes
and
the
natty
little
feet
they
intended
to
amuse
themselves
all
summer
by
watching
its
nimble
movements
its
ingenious
way
of
shelling
nuts
and
its
droll
play
they
immediately
put
in
order
an
old
squirrel
cage
with
a
little
green
house
and
a
wheel
the
little
house
which
had
both
doors
and
windows
the
lady
squirrel
was
to
use
as
a
dining
room
and
bedroom
for
this
reason
they
placed
therein
a
bed
of
leaves
a
bowl
of
milk
and
some
nuts
the
cylinder
wheel
on
the
other
hand
she
was
to
use
as
a
where
she
could
run
and
climb
and
swing
round
the
people
believed
that
they
had
arranged
things
very
comfortably
for
the
lady
squirrel
and
they
were
astonished
because
she
did
seem
to
be
contented
but
instead
she
sat
there
downcast
and
moody
in
a
corner
of
her
room
every
now
and
again
she
would
let
out
a
shrill
agonised
cry
she
did
not
touch
the
food
and
not
once
did
she
swing
round
on
the
wheel
it
probably
because
she
frightened
said
the
farmer
folk
when
she
feels
more
at
home
she
will
both
eat
and
play
meanwhile
the
women
folk
on
the
farm
were
making
preparations
for
a
feast
and
just
on
that
day
when
the
lady
squirrel
had
been
captured
they
were
busy
with
an
elaborate
bake
they
had
had
bad
luck
with
something
either
the
dough
would
rise
or
else
they
had
been
dilatory
for
they
were
obliged
to
work
long
after
dark
naturally
there
was
a
great
deal
of
excitement
and
bustle
in
the
kitchen
and
probably
no
one
there
took
time
to
think
about
the
squirrel
or
to
wonder
how
she
was
getting
on
but
there
was
an
old
grandma
in
the
house
who
was
too
aged
to
take
a
hand
in
the
baking
this
she
herself
understood
but
just
the
same
she
did
not
relish
the
idea
of
being
left
out
of
the
game
she
felt
rather
downhearted
and
for
this
reason
she
did
not
go
to
bed
but
seated
herself
by
the
window
and
looked
out
they
had
opened
the
kitchen
door
on
account
of
the
heat
and
through
it
a
clear
ray
of
light
streamed
out
on
the
yard
and
it
became
so
well
lighted
out
there
that
the
old
woman
could
see
all
the
cracks
and
holes
in
the
plastering
on
the
wall
opposite
she
also
saw
the
squirrel
cage
which
hung
just
where
the
light
fell
clearest
and
she
noticed
how
the
squirrel
ran
from
her
room
to
the
wheel
and
from
the
wheel
to
her
room
all
night
long
without
stopping
an
instant
she
thought
it
was
a
strange
sort
of
unrest
that
had
come
over
the
animal
but
she
believed
of
course
that
the
strong
light
kept
her
awake
between
the
and
the
stable
there
was
a
broad
handsome
this
too
came
within
the
as
the
night
wore
on
the
old
grandma
saw
a
tiny
creature
no
bigger
than
a
breadth
cautiously
steal
his
way
through
the
gate
he
was
dressed
in
leather
breeches
and
wooden
shoes
like
any
other
working
man
the
old
grandma
knew
at
once
that
it
was
the
elf
and
she
was
not
the
least
bit
frightened
she
had
always
heard
that
the
elf
kept
himself
somewhere
about
the
place
although
she
had
never
seen
him
before
and
an
elf
to
be
sure
brought
good
luck
wherever
he
appeared
as
soon
as
the
elf
came
into
the
yard
he
ran
right
up
to
the
squirrel
cage
and
since
it
hung
so
high
that
he
could
not
reach
it
he
went
over
to
the
after
a
rod
placed
it
against
the
cage
and
swung
himself
up
in
the
same
way
that
a
sailor
climbs
a
rope
when
he
had
reached
the
cage
he
shook
the
door
of
the
little
green
house
as
if
he
wanted
to
open
it
but
the
old
grandma
did
move
for
she
knew
that
the
children
had
put
a
padlock
on
the
door
as
they
feared
that
the
boys
on
the
neighbouring
farms
would
try
to
steal
the
squirrel
the
old
woman
saw
that
when
the
boy
could
not
get
the
door
open
the
lady
squirrel
came
out
to
the
wire
wheel
there
they
held
a
long
conference
together
and
when
the
boy
had
listened
to
all
that
the
imprisoned
animal
had
to
say
to
him
he
slid
down
the
rod
to
the
ground
and
ran
out
through
the
the
old
woman
did
expect
to
see
anything
more
of
the
elf
that
night
nevertheless
she
remained
at
the
window
after
a
few
moments
had
gone
by
he
returned
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
that
it
seemed
to
her
as
though
his
feet
hardly
touched
the
ground
and
he
rushed
right
up
to
the
squirrel
cage
the
old
woman
with
her
eyes
saw
him
distinctly
and
she
also
saw
that
he
carried
something
in
his
hands
but
what
it
was
she
could
imagine
the
thing
he
carried
in
his
left
hand
he
laid
down
on
the
pavement
but
that
which
he
held
in
his
right
hand
he
took
with
him
to
the
cage
he
kicked
so
hard
with
his
wooden
shoes
on
the
little
window
that
the
glass
was
broken
he
poked
in
the
thing
which
he
held
in
his
hand
to
the
lady
squirrel
then
he
slid
down
again
and
took
up
that
which
he
had
laid
upon
the
ground
and
climbed
up
to
the
cage
with
that
also
the
next
instant
he
ran
off
again
with
such
haste
that
the
old
woman
could
hardly
follow
him
with
her
eyes
but
now
it
was
the
old
grandma
who
could
no
longer
sit
still
in
the
cottage
but
who
very
slowly
went
out
to
the
back
yard
and
stationed
herself
in
the
shadow
of
the
pump
to
await
the
elf
return
and
there
was
one
other
who
had
also
seen
him
and
had
become
curious
this
was
the
house
cat
he
crept
along
slyly
and
stopped
close
to
the
wall
just
two
steps
away
from
the
stream
of
light
they
both
stood
and
waited
long
and
patiently
on
that
chilly
march
night
and
the
old
woman
was
just
beginning
to
think
about
going
in
again
when
she
heard
a
clatter
on
the
pavement
and
saw
that
the
little
mite
of
an
elf
came
trotting
along
once
more
carrying
a
burden
in
each
hand
as
he
had
done
before
that
which
he
bore
squealed
and
squirmed
and
now
a
light
dawned
on
the
old
grandma
she
understood
that
the
elf
had
hurried
down
to
the
and
brought
back
the
lady
squirrel
babies
and
that
he
was
carrying
them
to
her
so
they
should
starve
to
death
the
old
grandma
stood
very
still
so
as
not
to
disturb
them
and
it
did
not
look
as
if
the
elf
had
noticed
her
he
was
just
going
to
lay
one
of
the
babies
on
the
ground
so
that
he
could
swing
himself
up
to
the
cage
with
the
other
one
when
he
saw
the
house
cat
green
eyes
glisten
close
beside
him
he
stood
there
bewildered
with
a
young
one
in
each
hand
he
turned
around
and
looked
in
all
directions
then
he
became
aware
of
the
old
grandma
presence
then
he
did
not
hesitate
long
but
walked
forward
stretched
his
arms
as
high
as
he
could
reach
for
her
to
take
one
of
the
baby
squirrels
the
old
grandma
did
not
wish
to
prove
herself
unworthy
of
the
confidence
so
she
bent
down
and
took
the
baby
squirrel
and
stood
there
and
held
it
until
the
boy
had
swung
himself
up
to
the
cage
with
the
other
one
then
he
came
back
for
the
one
he
had
entrusted
to
her
care
the
next
morning
when
the
farm
folk
had
gathered
together
for
breakfast
it
was
impossible
for
the
old
woman
to
refrain
from
telling
them
of
what
she
had
seen
the
night
before
they
all
laughed
at
her
of
course
and
said
that
she
had
been
only
dreaming
there
were
no
baby
squirrels
this
early
in
the
year
but
she
was
sure
of
her
ground
and
begged
them
to
take
a
look
into
the
squirrel
cage
and
this
they
did
and
there
lay
on
the
bed
of
leaves
four
tiny
half
blind
baby
squirrels
who
were
at
least
a
couple
of
days
old
when
the
farmer
himself
saw
the
young
ones
he
said
be
it
as
it
may
with
this
but
one
thing
is
certain
we
on
this
farm
have
behaved
in
such
a
manner
that
we
are
shamed
before
both
animals
and
human
beings
and
thereupon
he
took
the
mother
squirrel
and
all
her
young
ones
from
the
cage
and
laid
them
in
the
old
grandma
lap
go
thou
out
to
the
with
them
said
he
and
let
them
have
their
freedom
back
again
it
was
this
event
that
was
so
much
talked
about
and
which
even
got
into
the
newspapers
but
which
the
majority
would
not
credit
because
they
were
not
able
to
explain
how
anything
like
that
could
have
happened
vittskövle
march
two
days
later
another
strange
thing
happened
a
flock
of
wild
geese
came
flying
one
morning
and
lit
on
a
meadow
down
in
eastern
skåne
not
very
far
from
vittskövle
manor
in
the
flock
were
thirteen
wild
geese
of
the
usual
gray
variety
and
one
white
who
carried
on
his
back
a
tiny
lad
dressed
in
yellow
leather
breeches
green
vest
and
a
white
woollen
toboggan
hood
they
were
now
very
near
the
eastern
sea
and
on
the
meadow
where
the
geese
had
alighted
the
soil
was
sandy
as
it
usually
is
on
the
it
looked
as
if
formerly
there
had
been
flying
sand
in
this
vicinity
which
had
to
be
held
down
for
in
several
directions
large
planted
could
be
seen
when
the
wild
geese
had
been
feeding
a
while
several
children
came
along
and
walked
on
the
edge
of
the
meadow
the
goose
who
was
on
guard
at
once
raised
herself
into
the
air
with
noisy
so
the
whole
flock
should
hear
that
there
was
danger
on
foot
all
the
wild
geese
flew
upward
but
the
white
one
trotted
along
on
the
ground
unconcerned
when
he
saw
the
others
fly
he
raised
his
head
and
called
after
them
you
need
fly
away
from
these
they
are
only
a
couple
of
children
the
little
creature
who
had
been
riding
on
his
back
sat
down
upon
a
knoll
on
the
outskirts
of
the
wood
and
picked
a
in
pieces
that
he
might
get
at
the
seeds
the
children
were
so
close
to
him
that
he
did
not
dare
to
run
across
the
meadow
to
the
white
one
he
concealed
himself
under
a
big
dry
and
at
the
same
time
gave
a
but
the
white
one
had
evidently
made
up
his
mind
not
to
let
himself
be
scared
he
walked
along
on
the
ground
all
the
while
and
not
once
did
he
look
to
see
in
what
direction
they
were
going
meanwhile
they
turned
from
the
path
walked
across
the
field
getting
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
when
he
finally
did
look
up
they
were
right
upon
him
he
was
so
dumfounded
and
became
so
confused
he
forgot
that
he
could
fly
and
tried
to
get
out
of
their
reach
by
running
but
the
children
followed
chasing
him
into
a
ditch
and
there
they
caught
him
the
larger
of
the
two
stuck
him
under
his
arm
and
carried
him
off
when
the
boy
who
lay
under
the
saw
this
he
sprang
up
as
if
he
wanted
to
take
the
away
from
them
then
he
must
have
remembered
how
little
and
powerless
he
was
for
he
threw
himself
on
the
knoll
and
beat
upon
the
ground
with
his
clenched
fists
the
cried
with
all
his
might
for
help
thumbietot
come
and
help
me
oh
thumbietot
come
and
help
me
the
boy
began
to
laugh
in
the
midst
of
his
distress
oh
yes
i
just
the
right
one
to
help
anybody
i
am
said
he
anyway
he
got
up
and
followed
the
i
ca
help
him
said
he
but
i
shall
at
least
find
out
where
they
are
taking
him
the
children
had
a
good
start
but
the
boy
had
no
difficulty
in
keeping
them
within
sight
until
they
came
to
a
hollow
where
a
brook
gushed
forth
but
here
he
was
obliged
to
run
alongside
of
it
for
some
little
time
before
he
could
find
a
place
narrow
enough
for
him
to
jump
over
when
he
came
up
from
the
hollow
the
children
had
disappeared
he
could
see
their
footprints
on
a
narrow
path
which
led
to
the
woods
and
these
he
continued
to
follow
soon
he
came
to
a
here
the
children
must
have
separated
for
there
were
footprints
in
two
directions
the
boy
looked
now
as
if
all
hope
had
fled
then
he
saw
a
little
white
down
on
a
and
he
understood
that
the
had
dropped
this
by
the
wayside
to
let
him
know
in
which
direction
he
had
been
carried
and
therefore
he
continued
his
search
he
followed
the
children
through
the
entire
wood
the
he
did
not
see
but
wherever
he
was
likely
to
miss
his
way
lay
a
little
white
down
to
put
him
right
the
boy
continued
faithfully
to
follow
the
bits
of
down
they
led
him
out
of
the
wood
across
a
couple
of
meadows
up
on
a
road
and
finally
through
the
entrance
of
a
broad
at
the
end
of
the
there
were
gables
and
towers
of
red
tiling
decorated
with
bright
borders
and
other
ornamentations
that
glittered
and
shone
when
the
boy
saw
that
this
was
some
great
manor
he
thought
he
knew
what
had
become
of
the
no
doubt
the
children
have
carried
the
to
the
manor
and
sold
him
there
by
this
time
he
probably
butchered
he
said
to
himself
but
he
did
not
seem
to
be
satisfied
with
anything
less
than
proof
positive
and
with
renewed
courage
he
ran
forward
he
met
no
one
in
the
and
that
was
well
for
such
as
he
are
generally
afraid
of
being
seen
by
human
beings
the
mansion
which
he
came
to
was
a
splendid
structure
with
four
great
wings
which
inclosed
a
courtyard
on
the
east
wing
there
was
a
high
arch
leading
into
the
courtyard
this
far
the
boy
ran
without
hesitation
but
when
he
got
there
he
stopped
he
dared
not
venture
farther
but
stood
still
and
pondered
what
he
should
do
now
there
he
stood
with
his
finger
on
his
nose
thinking
when
he
heard
footsteps
behind
him
and
as
he
turned
around
he
saw
a
whole
company
march
up
the
in
haste
he
stole
behind
a
which
stood
near
the
arch
and
hid
himself
those
who
came
up
were
some
twenty
young
men
from
a
out
on
a
walking
tour
they
were
accompanied
by
one
of
the
instructors
when
they
were
come
as
far
as
the
arch
the
teacher
requested
them
to
wait
there
a
moment
while
he
went
in
and
asked
if
they
might
see
the
old
castle
of
vittskövle
the
newcomers
were
warm
and
tired
as
if
they
had
been
on
a
long
tramp
one
of
them
was
so
thirsty
that
he
went
over
to
the
and
stooped
down
to
drink
he
had
a
tin
box
such
as
botanists
use
hanging
about
his
neck
he
evidently
thought
that
this
was
in
his
way
for
he
threw
it
down
on
the
ground
with
this
the
lid
flew
open
and
one
could
see
that
there
were
a
few
spring
flowers
in
it
the
botanist
box
dropped
just
in
front
of
the
boy
and
he
must
have
thought
that
here
was
his
opportunity
to
get
into
the
castle
and
find
out
what
had
become
of
the
he
smuggled
himself
quickly
into
the
box
and
concealed
himself
as
well
as
he
could
under
the
anemones
and
he
was
hardly
hidden
before
the
young
man
picked
the
box
up
hung
it
around
his
neck
and
slammed
down
the
cover
then
the
teacher
came
back
and
said
that
they
had
been
given
permission
to
enter
the
castle
at
first
he
conducted
them
no
farther
than
the
courtyard
there
he
stopped
and
began
to
talk
to
them
about
this
ancient
structure
he
called
their
attention
to
the
first
human
beings
who
had
inhabited
this
country
and
who
had
been
obliged
to
live
in
and
in
the
dens
of
wild
beasts
and
in
the
brushwood
and
that
a
very
long
period
had
elapsed
before
they
learned
to
build
themselves
huts
from
the
trunks
of
trees
and
afterward
how
long
had
they
not
been
forced
to
labour
and
struggle
before
they
had
advanced
from
the
log
cabin
with
its
single
room
to
the
building
of
a
castle
with
a
hundred
rooms
like
vittskövle
it
was
about
three
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
that
the
rich
and
powerful
built
such
castles
for
themselves
he
said
it
was
very
evident
that
vittskövle
had
been
erected
at
a
time
when
wars
and
robbers
made
it
unsafe
in
skåne
all
around
the
castle
was
a
deep
trench
filled
with
water
and
across
this
there
had
been
a
bridge
in
bygone
days
that
could
be
hoisted
up
over
the
there
is
even
to
this
day
a
and
all
along
the
sides
of
the
castle
ran
and
in
the
corners
stood
towers
with
walls
a
metre
thick
yet
the
castle
had
not
been
erected
in
the
most
savage
war
time
for
jens
brahe
who
built
it
had
also
studied
to
make
of
it
a
beautiful
and
decorative
ornament
if
they
could
see
the
big
solid
stone
structure
at
glimminge
which
had
been
built
only
a
generation
earlier
they
would
readily
see
that
jans
holgersen
ulfstand
the
builder
had
figured
upon
anything
else
only
to
build
big
and
strong
and
secure
without
bestowing
a
thought
upon
making
it
beautiful
and
comfortable
if
they
visited
such
castles
as
marsvinsholm
snogeholm
and
övid
cloister
which
were
erected
a
hundred
years
or
so
later
they
would
find
that
the
times
had
become
less
warlike
the
gentlemen
who
built
these
places
had
not
furnished
them
with
fortifications
but
had
only
taken
pains
to
provide
themselves
with
great
splendid
dwelling
houses
the
teacher
talked
at
length
and
in
detail
and
the
boy
who
lay
shut
up
in
the
box
was
pretty
impatient
but
he
must
have
lain
very
still
for
the
owner
of
the
box
had
the
least
suspicion
that
he
was
carrying
him
along
finally
the
company
went
into
the
castle
but
if
the
boy
had
hoped
for
a
chance
to
crawl
out
of
that
box
he
was
deceived
for
the
student
carried
it
upon
him
all
the
while
and
the
boy
was
obliged
to
accompany
him
through
all
the
rooms
it
was
a
tedious
tramp
the
teacher
stopped
every
other
minute
to
explain
and
instruct
in
one
room
he
found
an
old
fireplace
and
before
this
he
stopped
to
talk
about
the
different
kinds
of
fireplaces
that
had
been
used
in
the
course
of
time
the
first
indoors
fireplace
had
been
a
big
flat
stone
on
the
floor
of
the
hut
with
an
opening
in
the
roof
which
let
in
both
wind
and
rain
the
next
had
been
a
big
stone
hearth
with
no
opening
in
the
roof
this
must
have
made
the
hut
very
warm
but
it
also
filled
it
with
soot
and
smoke
when
vittskövle
was
built
the
people
had
advanced
far
enough
to
open
the
fireplace
which
at
that
time
had
a
wide
chimney
for
the
smoke
but
it
also
took
most
of
the
warmth
up
in
the
air
with
it
if
that
boy
had
ever
in
his
life
been
cross
and
impatient
he
was
given
a
good
lesson
in
patience
that
day
it
must
have
been
a
whole
hour
now
that
he
had
lain
perfectly
still
in
the
next
room
they
came
to
the
teacher
stopped
before
an
bed
with
its
high
canopy
and
rich
curtains
immediately
he
began
to
talk
about
the
beds
and
bed
places
of
olden
days
the
teacher
did
hurry
himself
but
then
he
did
not
know
of
course
that
a
poor
little
creature
lay
shut
up
in
a
botanist
box
and
only
waited
for
him
to
get
through
when
they
came
to
a
room
with
gilded
leather
hangings
he
talked
to
them
about
how
the
people
had
dressed
their
walls
and
ceilings
ever
since
the
beginning
of
time
and
when
he
came
to
an
old
family
portrait
he
told
them
all
about
the
different
changes
in
dress
and
in
the
banquet
halls
he
described
ancient
customs
of
celebrating
weddings
and
funerals
thereupon
the
teacher
talked
a
little
about
the
excellent
men
and
women
who
had
lived
in
the
castle
about
the
old
brahes
and
the
old
barnekows
of
christian
barnekow
who
had
given
his
horse
to
the
king
to
help
him
escape
of
margareta
ascheberg
who
had
been
married
to
kjell
barnekow
and
who
when
a
widow
had
managed
the
estates
and
the
whole
district
for
years
of
banker
hageman
a
farmer
son
from
vittskövle
who
had
grown
so
rich
that
he
had
bought
the
entire
estate
about
the
stjernsvärds
who
had
given
the
people
of
skåne
better
ploughs
which
enabled
them
to
discard
the
ridiculous
old
wooden
ploughs
that
three
oxen
were
hardly
able
to
drag
during
all
this
the
boy
lay
still
if
he
had
ever
been
mischievous
and
shut
the
cellar
door
on
his
father
or
mother
he
understood
now
how
they
had
felt
for
it
was
hours
and
hours
before
that
teacher
got
through
at
last
the
teacher
went
out
into
the
courtyard
again
and
there
he
discoursed
upon
the
tireless
labour
of
mankind
to
procure
for
themselves
tools
and
weapons
clothes
and
houses
and
ornaments
he
said
that
such
an
old
castle
as
vittskövle
was
a
on
time
highway
here
one
could
see
how
far
the
people
had
advanced
three
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
and
one
could
judge
for
oneself
whether
things
had
gone
forward
or
backward
since
their
time
but
this
dissertation
the
boy
escaped
hearing
for
the
student
who
carried
him
was
thirsty
again
and
stole
into
the
kitchen
to
ask
for
a
drink
of
water
when
the
boy
was
carried
into
the
kitchen
he
should
have
tried
to
look
around
for
the
he
had
begun
to
move
and
as
he
did
this
he
happened
to
press
too
hard
against
the
lid
and
it
flew
open
as
botanists
are
always
flying
open
the
student
thought
no
more
about
the
matter
but
pressed
it
down
again
then
the
cook
asked
him
if
he
had
a
snake
in
the
box
no
i
have
only
a
few
plants
the
student
replied
it
was
certainly
something
that
moved
there
insisted
the
cook
the
student
threw
back
the
lid
to
show
her
that
she
was
mistaken
see
for
yourself
if
but
he
got
no
further
for
now
the
boy
dared
not
stay
in
the
box
any
longer
but
with
one
bound
he
stood
on
the
floor
and
out
he
rushed
the
maids
hardly
had
time
to
see
what
it
was
that
ran
but
they
hurried
after
it
nevertheless
the
teacher
still
stood
and
talked
when
he
was
interrupted
by
shrill
cries
catch
him
catch
him
shrieked
those
who
had
come
from
the
kitchen
and
all
the
young
men
raced
after
the
boy
who
glided
away
faster
than
a
rat
they
tried
to
intercept
him
at
the
gate
but
it
was
not
so
easy
to
get
a
hold
on
such
a
little
creature
so
luckily
he
got
out
in
the
open
the
boy
did
not
dare
to
run
down
toward
the
open
but
turned
in
another
direction
he
rushed
through
the
garden
into
the
back
yard
all
the
while
the
people
raced
after
him
shrieking
and
laughing
the
poor
little
thing
ran
as
hard
as
ever
he
could
to
get
out
of
their
way
but
still
it
looked
as
though
the
people
would
catch
up
with
him
as
he
rushed
past
a
labourer
cottage
he
heard
a
goose
cackle
and
saw
a
white
down
lying
on
the
doorstep
there
at
last
was
the
he
had
been
on
the
wrong
track
before
he
thought
no
more
of
housemaids
and
men
who
were
hounding
him
but
climbed
up
the
steps
and
into
the
hallway
farther
he
could
come
for
the
door
was
locked
he
heard
how
the
cried
and
moaned
inside
but
he
could
get
the
door
open
the
hunters
that
were
pursuing
him
came
nearer
and
nearer
and
in
the
room
the
cried
more
and
more
pitifully
in
this
direst
of
needs
the
boy
finally
plucked
up
courage
and
pounded
on
the
door
with
all
his
might
a
child
opened
it
and
the
boy
looked
into
the
room
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
sat
a
woman
who
held
the
tight
to
clip
his
it
was
her
children
who
had
found
him
and
she
want
to
do
him
any
harm
it
was
her
intention
to
let
him
in
among
her
own
geese
had
she
only
succeeded
in
clipping
his
wings
so
he
fly
away
but
a
worse
fate
could
hardly
have
happened
to
the
and
he
shrieked
and
moaned
with
all
his
might
and
a
lucky
thing
it
was
that
the
woman
had
started
the
clipping
sooner
now
only
two
quills
had
fallen
under
the
shears
when
the
door
was
opened
and
the
boy
stood
on
the
but
a
creature
like
that
the
woman
had
never
seen
before
she
could
believe
anything
else
but
that
it
was
himself
and
in
her
terror
she
dropped
the
shears
clasped
her
hands
and
forgot
to
hold
on
to
the
as
soon
as
he
felt
himself
freed
he
ran
toward
the
door
he
did
give
himself
time
to
stop
but
as
he
ran
past
him
he
grabbed
the
boy
by
the
and
carried
him
along
with
him
on
the
stoop
he
spread
his
wings
and
flew
up
in
the
air
at
the
same
time
he
made
a
graceful
sweep
with
his
neck
and
seated
the
boy
on
his
smooth
downy
back
and
off
they
flew
while
all
vittskövle
stood
and
stared
after
them
in
övid
cloister
park
all
that
day
when
the
wild
geese
played
with
the
fox
the
boy
lay
and
slept
in
a
deserted
squirrel
nest
when
he
awoke
along
toward
evening
he
felt
very
uneasy
well
now
i
shall
soon
be
sent
home
again
then
i
have
to
exhibit
myself
before
father
and
mother
thought
he
but
when
he
looked
up
and
saw
the
wild
geese
who
lay
and
bathed
in
vomb
lake
not
one
of
them
said
a
word
about
his
going
they
probably
think
the
white
one
is
too
tired
to
travel
home
with
me
thought
the
boy
the
next
morning
the
geese
were
awake
at
daybreak
long
before
sunrise
now
the
boy
felt
sure
that
he
have
to
go
home
but
curiously
enough
both
he
and
the
white
were
permitted
to
follow
the
wild
ones
on
their
morning
tour
the
boy
could
comprehend
the
reason
for
the
delay
but
he
figured
it
out
in
this
way
that
the
wild
geese
did
not
care
to
send
the
on
such
a
long
journey
until
they
had
both
eaten
their
fill
come
what
might
he
was
only
glad
for
every
moment
that
should
pass
before
he
must
face
his
parents
the
wild
geese
travelled
over
övid
cloister
estate
which
was
situated
in
a
beautiful
park
east
of
the
lake
and
looked
very
imposing
with
its
great
castle
its
well
planned
court
surrounded
by
low
walls
and
pavilions
its
fine
garden
with
covered
arbours
streams
and
fountains
its
wonderful
trees
trimmed
bushes
and
its
evenly
mown
lawns
with
their
beds
of
beautiful
spring
flowers
when
the
wild
geese
rode
over
the
estate
in
the
early
morning
hour
there
was
no
human
being
about
when
they
had
carefully
assured
themselves
of
this
they
lowered
themselves
toward
the
dog
kennel
and
shouted
what
kind
of
a
little
hut
is
this
what
kind
of
a
little
hut
is
this
instantly
the
dog
came
out
of
his
kennel
furiously
angry
and
barked
at
the
air
do

call
this
a
hut

their

church
and
their

clouds

obey
commands
from
this
hut
wow
wow
wow
all
this
the
dog
managed
to
cry
out
in
one
breath
and
the
wild
geese
flew
back
and
forth
over
the
estate
and
listened
to
him
until
he
was
winded
but
then
they
cried
what
are
you
so
mad
about
we
did
ask
about
the
castle
we
only
wanted
to
know
about
your
kennel
stupid
when
the
boy
heard
this
joke
he
laughed
then
a
thought
stole
in
on
him
which
at
once
made
him
serious
think
how
many
of
these
amusing
things
you
would
hear
if
you
could
go
with
the
wild
geese
through
the
whole
country
all
the
way
up
to
lapland
said
he
to
himself
and
just
now
when
you
are
in
such
a
bad
fix
a
trip
like
that
would
be
the
best
thing
you
could
hit
upon
the
wild
geese
travelled
to
one
of
the
wide
fields
east
of
the
estate
to
eat
and
they
kept
this
up
for
hours
in
the
meantime
the
boy
wandered
in
the
great
park
which
bordered
the
field
he
hunted
up
a
grove
and
began
to
look
up
at
the
bushes
to
see
if
a
nut
from
last
fall
still
hung
there
but
again
and
again
the
thought
of
the
trip
came
over
him
as
he
walked
in
the
park
he
pictured
to
himself
what
a
fine
time
he
would
have
if
he
went
with
the
wild
geese
to
freeze
and
starve
that
he
believed
he
should
have
to
do
often
enough
but
as
a
recompense
he
would
escape
both
work
and
study
as
he
walked
there
the
old
gray
came
up
to
him
and
asked
if
he
had
found
anything
eatable
no
that
he
had
he
replied
and
then
she
tried
to
help
him
she
could
find
any
nuts
either
but
she
discovered
a
couple
of
dried
blossoms
that
hung
on
a
these
the
boy
ate
with
a
good
relish
but
he
wondered
what
mother
would
say
if
she
knew
that
he
had
lived
on
raw
fish
and
old
blossoms
when
the
wild
geese
had
finally
eaten
themselves
full
they
bore
off
toward
the
lake
again
where
they
amused
themselves
with
games
until
almost
dinner
time
the
wild
geese
challenged
the
white
to
take
part
in
all
kinds
of
sports
they
had
swimming
races
running
races
and
flying
races
with
him
the
big
tame
one
did
his
level
best
to
hold
his
own
but
the
clever
wild
geese
beat
him
every
time
all
the
while
the
boy
sat
on
the
back
and
encouraged
him
and
had
as
much
fun
as
the
rest
they
laughed
and
screamed
and
cackled
and
it
was
remarkable
that
the
people
on
the
estate
did
hear
them
when
the
wild
geese
were
tired
of
play
they
flew
out
on
the
ice
and
rested
for
a
couple
of
hours
the
afternoon
they
spent
in
pretty
much
the
same
way
as
the
forenoon
first
a
couple
of
hours
feeding
then
bathing
and
play
in
the
water
near
the
until
sunset
when
they
immediately
arranged
themselves
for
sleep
this
is
just
the
life
that
suits
me
thought
the
boy
when
he
crept
in
under
the
gander
wing
but
i
suppose
i
be
sent
home
before
he
fell
asleep
he
lay
and
thought
that
if
he
might
go
along
with
the
wild
geese
he
would
escape
all
scoldings
because
he
was
lazy
then
he
could
cut
loose
every
day
and
his
only
worry
would
be
to
get
something
to
eat
but
he
needed
so
little
nowadays
and
there
would
always
be
a
way
to
get
that
so
he
pictured
the
whole
scene
to
himself
what
he
should
see
and
all
the
adventures
that
he
would
be
in
on
yes
it
would
be
something
different
from
the
wear
and
tear
at
home
if
i
could
only
go
with
the
wild
geese
on
their
travels
i
should
grieve
because
i
been
transformed
thought
the
boy
he
was
afraid
of
anything
except
being
sent
home
but
not
even
on
wednesday
did
the
geese
say
anything
to
him
about
going
that
day
passed
in
the
same
way
as
tuesday
and
the
boy
grew
more
and
more
contented
with
the
outdoor
life
he
thought
that
he
had
the
lovely
övid
cloister
park
which
was
as
large
as
a
forest
all
to
himself
and
he
anxious
to
go
back
to
the
stuffy
cabin
and
the
little
patch
of
ground
there
at
home
on
wednesday
he
believed
that
the
wild
geese
thought
of
keeping
him
with
them
but
on
thursday
he
lost
hope
again
thursday
began
just
like
the
other
days
the
geese
fed
on
the
broad
meadows
and
the
boy
hunted
for
food
in
the
park
after
a
while
akka
came
to
him
and
asked
if
he
had
found
anything
to
eat
no
he
had
not
and
then
she
looked
up
a
dry
caraway
herb
that
had
kept
all
its
tiny
seeds
intact
when
the
boy
had
eaten
akka
said
that
she
thought
he
ran
around
in
the
park
altogether
too
recklessly
she
wondered
if
he
knew
how
many
enemies
he
had
to
guard
against
he
who
was
so
little
no
he
did
know
anything
at
all
about
that
then
akka
began
to
enumerate
them
for
him
whenever
he
walked
in
the
park
she
said
that
he
must
look
out
for
the
fox
and
the
marten
when
he
came
to
the
shores
of
the
lake
he
must
think
of
the
otters
as
he
sat
on
the
stone
wall
he
must
not
forget
the
weasels
who
could
creep
through
the
smallest
holes
and
if
he
wished
to
lie
down
and
sleep
on
a
pile
of
leaves
he
must
first
find
out
if
the
adders
were
not
sleeping
their
winter
sleep
in
the
same
pile
as
soon
as
he
came
out
in
the
open
fields
he
should
keep
an
eye
out
for
hawks
and
buzzards
for
eagles
and
falcons
that
soared
in
the
air
in
the
he
could
be
captured
by
the
magpies
and
crows
were
found
everywhere
and
in
these
he
must
place
any
too
much
confidence
as
soon
as
it
was
dusk
he
must
keep
his
ears
open
and
listen
for
the
big
owls
who
flew
along
with
such
soundless
that
they
could
come
right
up
to
him
before
he
was
aware
of
their
presence
when
the
boy
heard
that
there
were
so
many
who
were
after
his
life
he
thought
that
it
would
be
simply
impossible
for
him
to
escape
he
was
not
particularly
afraid
to
die
but
he
did
like
the
idea
of
being
eaten
up
so
he
asked
akka
what
he
should
do
to
protect
himself
from
the
carnivorous
animals
akka
answered
at
once
that
the
boy
should
try
to
get
on
good
terms
with
all
the
small
animals
in
the
woods
and
fields
with
the
and
the
with
bullfinches
and
the
titmice
and
woodpeckers
and
larks
if
he
made
friends
with
them
they
could
warn
him
against
dangers
find
hiding
places
for
him
and
protect
him
but
later
in
the
day
when
the
boy
tried
to
profit
by
this
counsel
and
turned
to
sirle
squirrel
to
ask
for
his
protection
it
was
evident
that
he
did
not
care
to
help
him
you
surely
ca
expect
anything
from
me
or
the
rest
of
the
small
animals
said
sirle
do
you
think
we
know
that
you
are
nils
the
goose
boy
who
tore
down
the
swallow

crushed
the

threw

in
the
caught

in
snares
and
put

in
cages
you
just
help
yourself
as
well
as
you
can
and
you
may
be
thankful
that
we
do
not
form
a
league
against
you
and
drive
you
back
to
your
own
kind
this
was
just
the
sort
of
answer
the
boy
would
not
have
let
go
unpunished
in
the
days
when
he
was
nils
the
goose
boy
but
now
he
was
only
fearful
lest
the
wild
geese
too
had
found
out
how
wicked
he
could
be
he
had
been
so
anxious
for
fear
he
would
be
permitted
to
stay
with
the
wild
geese
that
he
had
dared
to
get
into
the
least
little
mischief
since
he
joined
their
company
it
was
true
that
he
did
have
the
power
to
do
much
harm
now
but
little
as
he
was
he
could
have
destroyed
many
birds
nests
and
crushed
many
eggs
if
he
been
in
a
mind
to
now
he
had
been
good
he
had
pulled
a
feather
from
a
or
given
anyone
a
rude
answer
and
every
morning
when
he
called
upon
akka
he
had
always
removed
his
cap
and
bowed
all
day
thursday
he
thought
it
was
surely
on
account
of
his
wickedness
that
the
wild
geese
did
not
care
to
take
him
along
up
to
lapland
and
in
the
evening
when
he
heard
that
sirle
squirrel
wife
had
been
stolen
and
her
children
were
starving
to
death
he
made
up
his
mind
to
help
them
and
we
have
already
been
told
how
well
he
succeeded
when
the
boy
came
into
the
park
on
friday
he
heard
the
bulfinches
sing
in
every
bush
of
how
sirle
squirrel
wife
had
been
carried
away
from
her
children
by
cruel
robbers
and
how
nils
the
goose
boy
had
risked
his
life
among
human
beings
and
taken
the
little
squirrel
children
to
her
and
who
is
so
honoured
in
övid
cloister
park
now
as
thumbietot
sang
the
bullfinch
he
whom
all
feared
when
he
was
nils
the
goose
boy
sirle
squirrel
will
give
him
nuts
the
poor
hares
are
going
to
play
with
him
the
small
wild
animals
will
carry
him
on
their
backs
and
fly
away
with
him
when
smirre
fox
approaches
the
titmice
are
going
to
warn
him
against
the
hawk
and
the
finches
and
larks
will
sing
of
his
valour
the
boy
was
absolutely
certain
that
both
akka
and
the
wild
geese
had
heard
all
this
but
still
friday
passed
and
not
one
word
did
they
say
about
his
remaining
with
them
until
saturday
the
wild
geese
fed
in
the
fields
around
övid
undisturbed
by
smirre
fox
but
on
saturday
morning
when
they
came
out
in
the
meadows
he
lay
in
wait
for
them
and
chased
them
from
one
field
to
another
and
they
were
not
allowed
to
eat
in
peace
when
akka
understood
that
he
did
intend
to
leave
them
in
peace
she
came
to
a
decision
quickly
raised
herself
into
the
air
and
flew
with
her
flock
several
miles
away
over
plains
and
linderödsosen
hills
they
did
not
stop
before
they
had
arrived
in
the
district
of
vittskövle
but
at
vittskövle
the
was
stolen
and
how
it
happened
has
already
been
related
if
the
boy
had
not
used
all
his
powers
to
help
him
he
would
never
again
have
been
found
on
saturday
evening
as
the
boy
came
back
to
vomb
lake
with
the
he
thought
that
he
had
done
a
good
day
work
and
he
speculated
a
good
deal
on
what
akka
and
the
wild
geese
would
say
to
him
the
wild
geese
were
not
at
all
sparing
in
their
praises
but
they
did
not
say
the
word
he
was
longing
to
hear
then
sunday
came
again
a
whole
week
had
gone
by
since
the
boy
had
been
bewitched
and
he
was
still
just
as
little
but
he
did
appear
to
be
giving
himself
any
extra
worry
on
account
of
this
thing
on
sunday
afternoon
he
sat
huddled
together
in
a
big
fluffy
down
by
the
lake
and
blew
on
a
all
around
him
there
sat
as
many
finches
and
bullfinches
and
starlings
as
the
bush
could
well
hold
who
sang
songs
which
he
tried
to
teach
himself
to
play
but
the
boy
was
not
at
home
in
this
art
he
blew
so
false
that
the
feathers
raised
themselves
on
the
little
and
they
shrieked
and
fluttered
in
their
despair
the
boy
laughed
so
heartily
at
their
excitement
that
he
dropped
his
pipe
he
began
once
again
and
that
went
just
as
badly
then
all
the
little
birds
wailed
you
play
worse
than
usual
thumbietot
you
take
one
true
note
where
are
your
thoughts
thumbietot
they
are
elsewhere
said
the
boy
and
this
was
true
he
sat
there
and
pondered
how
long
he
would
be
allowed
to
remain
with
the
wild
geese
or
if
he
should
be
sent
home
perhaps
finally
the
boy
threw
down
his
pipe
and
jumped
from
the
bush
he
had
seen
akka
and
all
the
wild
geese
coming
toward
him
in
a
long
row
they
walked
so
uncommonly
slow
and
that
the
boy
immediately
understood
that
now
he
should
learn
what
they
intended
to
do
with
him
when
they
stopped
at
last
akka
said
you
may
well
have
reason
to
wonder
at
me
thumbietot
who
have
not
said
thanks
to
you
for
saving
me
from
smirre
fox
but
i
am
one
of
those
who
would
rather
give
thanks
by
deeds
than
words
i
have
sent
word
to
the
elf
that
bewitched
you
at
first
he
did
want
to
hear
anything
about
curing
you
but
i
have
sent
message
upon
message
to
him
and
told
him
how
well
you
have
conducted
yourself
among
us
he
greets
you
and
says
that
as
soon
as
you
turn
back
home
you
shall
be
human
again
but
think
of
it
just
as
happy
as
the
boy
had
been
when
the
wild
geese
began
to
speak
just
that
miserable
was
he
when
they
had
finished
he
did
say
a
word
but
turned
away
and
wept
what
in
all
the
world
is
this
said
akka
it
looks
as
though
you
had
expected
more
of
me
than
i
have
offered
you
but
the
boy
was
thinking
of
the
days
and
the
banter
and
of
adventure
and
freedom
and
travel
high
above
the
earth
that
he
should
miss
and
he
actually
bawled
with
grief
i
do
want
to
be
human
said
he
i
want
to
go
with
you
to
lapland
i
tell
you
something
said
akka
that
elf
is
very
touchy
and
i
afraid
that
if
you
do
not
accept
his
offer
now
it
will
be
difficult
for
you
to
coax
him
another
time
it
was
a
strange
thing
about
that
boy
as
long
as
he
had
lived
he
had
never
cared
for
anyone
he
had
not
cared
for
his
father
or
mother
not
for
the
school
teacher
not
for
his
nor
for
the
boys
in
the
neighbourhood
all
that
they
had
wished
to
have
him
do
whether
it
had
been
work
or
play
he
had
only
thought
tiresome
therefore
there
was
no
one
whom
he
missed
or
longed
for
the
only
ones
that
he
had
come
anywhere
near
agreeing
with
were
osa
the
goose
girl
and
little
mats
a
couple
of
children
who
had
tended
geese
in
the
fields
like
himself
but
he
did
care
particularly
for
them
either
no
far
from
it
i
do
want
to
be
human
bawled
the
boy
i
want
to
go
with
you
to
lapland
that
why
i
been
good
for
a
whole
week
i
do
want
to
forbid
you
to
come
along
with
us
as
far
as
you
like
said
akka
but
think
first
if
you
would
rather
go
home
again
a
day
may
come
when
you
will
regret
this
no
said
the
boy
that
nothing
to
regret
i
have
never
been
as
well
off
as
here
with
you
well
then
let
it
be
as
you
wish
said
akka
thanks
said
the
boy
and
he
felt
so
happy
that
he
had
to
cry
for
very
joy
just
as
he
had
cried
before
from
sorrow
glimminge
castle
black
rats
and
gray
rats
in
skåne
not
far
from
the
sea
there
is
an
old
castle
called
glimminge
it
is
a
big
and
substantial
stone
house
and
can
be
seen
over
the
plain
for
miles
around
it
is
not
more
than
four
stories
high
but
it
is
so
ponderous
that
an
ordinary
farmhouse
which
stands
on
the
same
estate
looks
like
a
little
children
playhouse
in
comparison
the
big
stone
house
has
such
thick
ceilings
and
partitions
that
there
is
scarcely
room
in
its
interior
for
anything
but
the
thick
walls
the
stairs
are
narrow
the
entrances
small
and
the
rooms
few
that
the
walls
might
retain
their
strength
there
are
only
the
fewest
number
of
windows
in
the
upper
stories
and
none
at
all
are
found
in
the
lower
ones
in
the
old
war
times
the
people
were
just
as
glad
that
they
could
shut
themselves
up
in
a
strong
and
massive
house
like
this
as
one
is
nowadays
to
be
able
to
creep
into
furs
in
a
snapping
cold
winter
but
when
the
time
of
peace
came
they
did
not
care
to
live
in
the
dark
and
cold
stone
halls
of
the
old
castle
any
longer
they
have
long
since
deserted
the
big
glimminge
castle
and
moved
into
dwelling
places
where
the
light
and
air
can
penetrate
at
the
time
when
nils
holgersson
wandered
around
with
the
wild
geese
there
were
no
human
beings
in
glimminge
castle
but
for
all
that
it
was
not
without
inhabitants
every
summer
there
lived
a
stork
couple
in
a
large
nest
on
the
roof
in
a
nest
in
the
attic
lived
a
pair
of
gray
owls
in
the
secret
passages
hung
bats
in
the
kitchen
oven
lived
an
old
cat
and
down
in
the
cellar
there
were
hundreds
of
old
black
rats
rats
are
not
held
in
very
high
esteem
by
other
animals
but
the
black
rats
at
glimminge
castle
were
an
exception
they
were
always
mentioned
with
respect
because
they
had
shown
great
valour
in
battle
with
their
enemies
and
much
endurance
under
the
great
misfortunes
which
had
befallen
their
kind
they
nominally
belong
to
a
who
at
one
time
had
been
very
numerous
and
powerful
but
who
were
now
dying
out
during
a
long
period
of
time
the
black
rats
owned
skåne
and
the
whole
country
they
were
found
in
every
cellar
in
every
attic
in
larders
and
cowhouses
and
barns
in
breweries
and
in
churches
and
castles
in
every
building
but
now
they
were
banished
from
all
this
and
were
almost
exterminated
only
in
one
and
another
old
and
secluded
place
could
one
run
across
a
few
of
them
and
nowhere
were
they
to
be
found
in
such
large
numbers
as
in
glimminge
castle
when
an
animal
folk
die
out
it
is
generally
the
human
kind
who
are
the
cause
of
it
but
that
was
not
the
case
in
this
instance
the
people
had
certainly
struggled
with
the
black
rats
but
they
had
not
been
able
to
do
them
any
harm
worth
mentioning
those
who
had
conquered
them
were
an
animal
folk
of
their
own
kind
who
were
called
gray
rats
these
gray
rats
had
not
lived
in
the
land
since
time
immemorial
like
the
black
rats
but
descended
from
a
couple
of
poor
immigrants
who
landed
in
malmö
from
a
libyan
sloop
about
a
hundred
years
ago
they
were
homeless
wretches
who
stuck
close
to
the
harbour
swam
among
the
piles
under
the
bridges
and
ate
refuse
that
was
thrown
in
the
water
they
never
ventured
into
the
city
which
was
owned
by
the
black
rats
but
gradually
as
the
gray
rats
increased
in
number
they
grew
bolder
at
first
they
moved
over
to
some
waste
places
and
condemned
old
houses
which
the
black
rats
had
abandoned
they
hunted
their
food
in
gutters
and
dirt
heaps
and
made
the
most
of
all
the
rubbish
that
the
black
rats
did
not
deign
to
take
care
of
they
were
hardy
contented
and
fearless
and
within
a
few
years
they
had
become
so
powerful
that
they
undertook
to
drive
the
black
rats
out
of
malmö
they
took
from
them
attics
cellars
and
storerooms
starved
them
out
or
bit
them
to
death
for
they
were
not
at
all
afraid
of
fighting
when
malmö
was
captured
they
marched
forward
in
small
and
large
companies
to
conquer
the
whole
country
it
is
almost
impossible
to
comprehend
why
the
black
rats
did
not
muster
themselves
into
a
great
united
to
exterminate
the
gray
rats
while
these
were
still
few
in
numbers
but
the
black
rats
were
so
certain
of
their
power
that
they
could
not
believe
it
possible
for
them
to
lose
it
they
sat
still
on
their
estates
and
in
the
meantime
the
gray
rats
took
from
them
farm
after
farm
city
after
city
they
were
starved
out
forced
out
rooted
out
in
skåne
they
had
not
been
able
to
maintain
themselves
in
a
single
place
except
glimminge
castle
the
old
castle
had
such
secure
walls
and
such
few
rat
passages
led
through
these
that
the
black
rats
had
managed
to
protect
themselves
and
to
prevent
the
gray
rats
from
crowding
in
night
after
night
year
after
year
the
struggle
had
continued
between
the
aggressors
and
the
defenders
but
the
black
rats
had
kept
faithful
watch
and
had
fought
with
the
utmost
contempt
for
death
and
thanks
to
the
fine
old
house
they
had
always
conquered
it
will
have
to
be
acknowledged
that
as
long
as
the
black
rats
were
in
power
they
were
as
much
shunned
by
all
other
living
creatures
as
the
gray
rats
are
in
our
day
and
for
just
cause
they
had
thrown
themselves
upon
poor
fettered
prisoners
and
tortured
them
they
had
ravished
the
dead
they
had
stolen
the
last
turnip
from
the
cellars
of
the
poor
bitten
off
the
feet
of
sleeping
geese
robbed
eggs
and
chicks
from
the
hens
and
committed
a
thousand
depredations
but
since
they
had
come
to
grief
all
this
seemed
to
have
been
forgotten
and
no
one
could
help
but
marvel
at
the
last
of
a
race
that
had
held
out
so
long
against
its
enemies
the
gray
rats
that
lived
in
the
courtyard
at
glimminge
and
in
the
vicinity
kept
up
a
continuous
warfare
and
tried
to
watch
out
for
every
possible
chance
to
capture
the
castle
one
would
fancy
that
they
should
have
allowed
the
little
company
of
black
rats
to
occupy
glimminge
castle
in
peace
since
they
themselves
had
acquired
all
the
rest
of
the
country
but
you
may
be
sure
this
thought
never
occurred
to
them
they
were
wont
to
say
that
it
was
a
point
of
honour
with
them
to
conquer
the
black
rats
at
some
time
or
other
but
those
who
were
acquainted
with
the
gray
rats
must
have
known
that
it
was
because
the
human
kind
used
glimminge
castle
as
a
grain
that
the
gray
ones
could
not
rest
before
they
had
taken
possession
of
the
place
the
stork
march
early
one
morning
the
wild
geese
who
stood
and
slept
on
the
ice
in
vomb
lake
were
awakened
by
long
calls
from
the
air
trirop
trirop
it
sounded
trianut
the
crane
sends
greetings
to
akka
the
wild
goose
and
her
flock
will
be
the
day
of
the
great
crane
dance
on
kullaberg
akka
raised
her
head
and
answered
at
once
greetings
and
thanks
greetings
and
thanks
with
that
the
cranes
flew
farther
and
the
wild
geese
heard
them
for
a
long
while
where
they
travelled
and
called
out
over
every
field
and
every
wooded
hill
trianut
sends
greetings
will
be
the
day
of
the
great
crane
dance
on
kullaberg
the
wild
geese
were
very
happy
over
this
invitation
you
in
luck
they
said
to
the
white
to
be
permitted
to
attend
the
great
crane
dance
on
kullaberg
is
it
then
so
remarkable
to
see
cranes
dance
asked
the
it
is
something
that
you
have
never
even
dreamed
about
replied
the
wild
geese
now
we
must
think
out
what
we
shall
do
with
thumbietot
so
that
no
harm
can
come
to
him
while
we
run
over
to
kullaberg
said
akka
thumbietot
shall
not
be
left
alone
said
the
if
the
cranes
wo
let
him
see
their
dance
then
i
stay
with
him
no
human
being
has
ever
been
permitted
to
attend
the
animal
congress
at
kullaberg
said
akka
and
i
should
dare
to
take
thumbietot
along
but
we
discuss
this
more
at
length
later
in
the
day
now
we
must
first
and
foremost
think
about
getting
something
to
eat
with
that
akka
gave
the
signal
to
adjourn
on
this
day
she
also
sought
her
a
good
distance
away
on
smirre
fox
account
and
she
did
alight
until
she
came
to
the
swampy
meadows
a
little
south
of
glimminge
castle
all
that
day
the
boy
sat
on
the
shores
of
a
little
pond
and
blew
on
he
was
out
of
sorts
because
he
should
see
the
crane
dance
and
he
just
could
say
a
word
either
to
the
or
to
any
of
the
others
it
was
pretty
hard
that
akka
should
still
doubt
him
when
a
boy
had
given
up
being
human
just
to
travel
around
with
a
few
wild
geese
they
surely
ought
to
understand
that
he
had
no
desire
to
betray
them
then
too
they
ought
to
understand
that
when
he
had
renounced
so
much
to
follow
them
it
was
their
duty
to
let
him
see
all
the
wonders
they
could
show
him
i
have
to
speak
my
mind
right
out
to
them
thought
he
but
hour
after
hour
passed
still
he
had
come
round
to
it
it
may
sound
remarkable
but
the
boy
had
actually
acquired
a
kind
of
respect
for
the
old
he
felt
that
it
was
not
easy
to
pit
his
will
against
hers
on
one
side
of
the
swampy
meadow
where
the
wild
geese
fed
there
was
a
broad
stone
hedge
toward
evening
when
the
boy
finally
raised
his
head
to
speak
to
akka
his
glance
happened
to
rest
on
this
hedge
he
uttered
a
little
cry
of
surprise
and
all
the
wild
geese
instantly
looked
up
and
stared
in
the
same
direction
at
first
both
the
geese
and
the
boy
thought
that
all
the
round
gray
stones
in
the
hedge
had
acquired
legs
and
were
starting
on
a
run
but
soon
they
saw
that
it
was
a
company
of
rats
who
ran
over
it
they
moved
very
rapidly
and
ran
forward
tightly
packed
line
upon
line
and
were
so
numerous
that
for
some
time
they
covered
the
entire
stone
hedge
the
boy
had
been
afraid
of
rats
even
when
he
was
a
big
strong
human
being
then
what
must
his
feelings
be
now
when
he
was
so
tiny
that
two
or
three
of
them
could
overpower
him
one
shudder
after
another
travelled
down
his
spinal
column
as
he
stood
and
stared
at
them
but
strangely
enough
the
wild
geese
seemed
to
feel
the
same
aversion
toward
the
rats
that
he
did
they
did
not
speak
to
them
and
when
they
were
gone
they
shook
themselves
as
if
their
feathers
had
been
such
a
lot
of
gray
rats
abroad
said
iksi
from
vassipaure
that
not
a
good
omen
the
boy
intended
to
take
advantage
of
this
opportunity
to
say
to
akka
that
he
thought
she
ought
to
let
him
go
with
them
to
kullaberg
but
he
was
prevented
anew
for
all
of
a
sudden
a
big
bird
came
down
in
the
midst
of
the
geese
one
could
believe
when
one
looked
at
this
bird
that
he
had
borrowed
body
neck
and
head
from
a
little
white
goose
but
in
addition
to
this
he
had
procured
for
himself
large
black
wings
long
red
legs
and
a
thick
bill
which
was
too
large
for
the
little
head
and
weighed
it
down
until
it
gave
him
a
sad
and
worried
look
akka
at
once
straightened
out
the
folds
of
her
wings
and
curtsied
many
times
as
she
approached
the
stork
she
was
specially
surprised
to
see
him
in
skåne
so
early
in
the
spring
because
she
knew
that
the
male
storks
are
in
the
habit
of
coming
in
good
season
to
take
a
look
at
the
nest
and
see
that
it
has
been
damaged
during
the
winter
before
the
female
storks
go
to
the
trouble
of
flying
over
the
east
sea
but
she
wondered
very
much
what
it
might
signify
that
he
sought
her
out
since
storks
prefer
to
associate
with
members
of
their
own
family
i
can
hardly
believe
that
there
is
anything
wrong
with
your
house
herr
ermenrich
said
akka
it
was
apparent
now
that
it
is
true
what
they
say
a
stork
can
seldom
open
his
bill
without
complaining
but
what
made
the
thing
he
said
sound
even
more
doleful
was
that
it
was
difficult
for
him
to
speak
out
he
stood
for
a
long
time
and
only
clattered
with
his
bill
afterward
he
spoke
in
a
hoarse
and
feeble
voice
he
complained
about
everything
the
nest
which
was
situated
at
the
very
top
of
the
at
glimminge
castle
had
been
totally
destroyed
by
winter
storms
and
no
food
could
he
get
any
more
in
skåne
the
people
of
skåne
were
appropriating
all
his
possessions
they
dug
out
his
marshes
and
laid
waste
his
swamps
he
intended
to
move
away
from
this
country
and
never
return
to
it
again
while
the
stork
grumbled
akka
the
wild
goose
who
had
neither
home
nor
protection
could
not
help
thinking
to
herself
if
i
had
things
as
comfortable
as
you
have
herr
ermenrich
i
should
be
above
complaining
you
have
remained
a
free
and
wild
bird
and
still
you
stand
so
well
with
human
beings
that
no
one
will
fire
a
shot
at
you
or
steal
an
egg
from
your
nest
but
all
this
she
kept
to
herself
to
the
stork
she
only
remarked
that
she
could
believe
he
would
be
willing
to
move
from
a
house
where
storks
had
resided
ever
since
it
was
built
then
the
stork
suddenly
asked
the
geese
if
they
had
seen
the
gray
rats
who
were
marching
toward
glimminge
castle
when
akka
replied
that
she
had
seen
the
horrid
creatures
he
began
to
tell
her
about
the
brave
black
rats
who
for
years
had
defended
the
castle
but
this
night
glimminge
castle
will
fall
into
the
gray
rats
power
sighed
the
stork
and
why
just
this
night
herr
ermenrich
asked
akka
well
because
nearly
all
the
black
rats
went
over
to
kullaberg
last
night
said
the
stork
since
they
had
counted
on
all
the
rest
of
the
animals
also
hurrying
there
but
you
see
that
the
gray
rats
have
stayed
at
home
and
now
they
are
mustering
to
storm
the
castle
when
it
will
be
defended
by
only
a
few
old
creatures
who
are
too
feeble
to
go
over
to
kullaberg
they
probably
accomplish
their
purpose
but
i
have
lived
here
in
harmony
with
the
black
rats
for
so
many
years
that
it
does
not
please
me
to
live
in
a
place
inhabited
by
their
enemies
akka
understood
now
that
the
stork
had
become
so
enraged
over
the
gray
rats
mode
of
action
that
he
had
sought
her
out
as
an
excuse
to
complain
about
them
but
after
the
manner
of
storks
he
certainly
had
done
nothing
to
avert
the
disaster
have
you
sent
word
to
the
black
rats
herr
ermenrich
she
asked
no
replied
the
stork
that
would
be
of
any
use
before
they
can
get
back
the
castle
will
be
taken
you
must
be
so
sure
of
that
herr
ermenrich
said
akka
i
know
an
old
wild
goose
i
do
who
will
gladly
prevent
outrages
of
this
kind
when
akka
said
this
the
stork
raised
his
head
and
stared
at
her
and
it
was
not
surprising
for
akka
had
neither
claws
nor
bill
that
were
fit
for
fighting
and
in
the
bargain
she
was
a
day
bird
and
as
soon
as
it
grew
dark
she
fell
helplessly
asleep
while
the
rats
did
their
fighting
at
night
but
akka
had
evidently
made
up
her
mind
to
help
the
black
rats
she
called
iksi
from
vassijaure
and
ordered
him
to
take
the
wild
geese
over
to
vonib
lake
and
when
the
geese
made
excuses
she
said
authoritatively
i
believe
it
will
be
best
for
us
all
that
you
obey
me
i
must
fly
over
to
the
big
stone
house
and
if
you
follow
me
the
people
on
the
place
will
be
sure
to
see
us
and
shoot
us
down
the
only
one
that
i
want
to
take
with
me
on
this
trip
is
thumbietot
he
can
be
of
great
service
to
me
because
he
has
good
eyes
and
can
keep
awake
at
night
the
boy
was
in
his
most
contrary
mood
that
day
and
when
he
heard
what
akka
said
he
raised
himself
to
his
full
height
and
stepped
forward
his
hands
behind
him
and
his
nose
in
the
air
and
he
intended
to
say
that
he
most
assuredly
did
not
wish
to
take
a
hand
in
the
fight
with
gray
rats
she
might
look
around
for
assistance
elsewhere
but
the
instant
the
boy
was
seen
the
stork
began
to
move
he
had
stood
before
as
storks
generally
stand
with
head
bent
downward
and
the
bill
pressed
against
the
neck
but
now
a
gurgle
was
heard
deep
down
in
his
windpipe
as
though
he
would
have
laughed
quick
as
a
flash
he
lowered
the
bill
grabbed
the
boy
and
tossed
him
a
couple
of
metres
in
the
air
this
feat
he
performed
seven
times
while
the
boy
shrieked
and
the
geese
shouted
what
are
you
trying
to
do
herr
ermenrich
that
not
a
frog
that
a
human
being
herr
ermenrich
finally
the
stork
put
the
boy
down
entirely
unhurt
thereupon
he
said
to
akka
i
fly
back
to
glimminge
castle
now
mother
akka
all
who
live
there
were
very
much
worried
when
i
left
you
may
be
sure
they
be
very
glad
when
i
tell
them
that
akka
the
wild
goose
and
thumbietot
the
human
elf
are
on
their
way
to
rescue
them
with
that
the
stork
craned
his
neck
raised
his
wings
and
darted
off
like
an
arrow
when
it
leaves
a
bow
akka
understood
that
he
was
making
fun
of
her
but
she
did
let
it
bother
her
she
waited
until
the
boy
had
found
his
wooden
shoes
which
the
stork
had
shaken
off
then
she
put
him
on
her
back
and
followed
the
stork
on
his
own
account
the
boy
made
no
objection
and
said
not
a
word
about
not
wanting
to
go
along
he
had
become
so
furious
with
the
stork
that
he
actually
sat
and
puffed
that
long
thing
believed
he
was
of
no
account
just
because
he
was
little
but
he
would
show
him
what
kind
of
a
man
nils
holgersson
from
west
vemminghög
was
a
couple
of
moments
later
akka
stood
in
the
storks
nest
it
had
a
wheel
for
foundation
and
over
this
lay
several
and
some
twigs
the
nest
was
so
old
that
many
shrubs
and
plants
had
taken
root
up
there
and
when
the
mother
stork
sat
on
her
eggs
in
the
round
hole
in
the
middle
of
the
nest
she
not
only
had
the
beautiful
outlook
over
a
goodly
portion
of
skåne
to
enjoy
but
she
had
also
the
wild
and
to
look
upon
both
akka
and
the
boy
saw
immediately
that
something
was
going
on
here
which
turned
upside
down
the
most
regular
order
on
the
edge
of
the
sat
two
gray
owls
an
old
cat
and
a
dozen
old
decrepit
rats
with
protruding
teeth
and
watery
eyes
they
were
not
exactly
the
sort
of
animals
one
usually
finds
living
peaceably
together
not
one
of
them
turned
around
to
look
at
akka
or
to
bid
her
welcome
they
thought
of
nothing
except
to
sit
and
stare
at
some
long
gray
lines
which
came
into
sight
here
and
there
on
the
meadows
all
the
black
rats
were
silent
one
could
see
that
they
were
in
deep
despair
and
probably
knew
that
they
could
neither
defend
their
own
lives
nor
the
castle
the
two
owls
sat
and
rolled
their
big
eyes
and
twisted
their
great
encircling
eyebrows
and
talked
in
hollow
voices
about
the
awful
cruelty
of
the
gray
rats
and
that
they
would
have
to
move
away
from
their
nest
because
they
had
heard
it
said
of
them
that
they
spared
neither
eggs
nor
baby
birds
the
old
cat
was
positive
that
the
gray
rats
would
bite
him
to
death
since
they
were
coming
into
the
castle
in
such
great
numbers
and
he
scolded
the
black
rats
incessantly
how
could
you
be
so
idiotic
as
to
let
your
best
fighters
go
away
said
he
how
could
you
trust
the
gray
rats
it
is
absolutely
unpardonable
the
twelve
black
rats
did
not
say
a
word
but
the
stork
despite
his
misery
could
not
refrain
from
teasing
the
cat
do
worry
so
monsie
said
he
ca
you
see
that
mother
akka
and
thumbietot
have
come
to
save
the
castle
you
can
be
certain
that
they
succeed
now
i
must
stand
up
to
sleep
and
i
do
so
with
the
utmost
calm
when
i
awaken
there
wo
be
a
single
gray
rat
in
glimminge
castle
the
boy
winked
at
akka
and
made
a
sign
as
the
stork
stood
upon
the
very
edge
of
the
nest
with
one
leg
drawn
up
to
sleep
that
he
wanted
to
push
him
down
to
the
ground
but
akka
restrained
him
she
did
not
seem
to
be
the
least
bit
angry
instead
she
said
in
a
confident
tone
of
voice
it
would
be
pretty
poor
business
if
one
who
is
as
old
as
i
am
could
not
manage
to
get
out
of
worse
difficulties
than
this
if
only
and
owl
who
can
stay
awake
all
night
will
fly
off
with
a
couple
of
messages
for
me
i
think
that
all
will
go
well
both
owls
were
willing
then
akka
bade
the
gentleman
owl
that
he
should
go
and
seek
the
black
rats
who
had
gone
off
and
counsel
them
to
hurry
home
immediately
the
lady
owl
she
sent
to
flammea
the
who
lived
in
lund
cathedral
with
a
commission
which
was
so
secret
that
akka
only
dared
to
confide
it
to
her
in
a
whisper
the
rat
charmer
it
was
getting
on
toward
midnight
when
the
gray
rats
after
a
diligent
search
succeeded
in
finding
an
open
in
the
cellar
this
was
pretty
high
upon
the
wall
but
the
rats
got
up
on
one
shoulders
and
it
was
long
before
the
most
daring
among
them
sat
in
the
ready
to
force
its
way
into
glimminge
castle
outside
whose
walls
so
many
of
its
forebears
had
fallen
the
gray
rat
sat
still
for
a
moment
in
the
hole
and
waited
for
an
attack
from
within
the
leader
of
the
defenders
was
certainly
away
but
she
assumed
that
the
black
rats
who
were
still
in
the
castle
surrender
without
a
struggle
with
thumping
heart
she
listened
for
the
slightest
sound
but
everything
remained
quiet
then
the
leader
of
the
gray
rats
plucked
up
courage
and
jumped
down
in
the
cellar
one
after
another
of
the
gray
rats
followed
the
leader
they
all
kept
very
quiet
and
all
expected
to
be
ambushed
by
the
black
rats
not
until
so
many
of
them
had
crowded
into
the
cellar
that
the
floor
could
hold
any
more
did
they
venture
farther
although
they
had
never
before
been
inside
the
building
they
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
their
way
they
soon
found
the
passages
in
the
walls
which
the
black
rats
had
used
to
get
to
the
upper
floors
before
they
began
to
clamber
up
these
narrow
and
steep
steps
they
listened
again
with
great
attention
they
felt
more
frightened
because
the
black
rats
held
themselves
aloof
in
this
way
than
if
they
had
met
them
in
open
battle
they
could
hardly
believe
their
luck
when
they
reached
the
first
story
without
any
mishaps
immediately
upon
their
entrance
the
gray
rats
caught
the
scent
of
the
grain
which
was
stored
in
great
bins
on
the
floor
but
it
was
not
as
yet
time
for
them
to
begin
to
enjoy
their
conquest
they
searched
first
with
the
utmost
caution
through
the
sombre
empty
rooms
they
ran
up
in
the
fireplace
which
stood
on
the
floor
in
the
old
castle
kitchen
and
they
almost
tumbled
into
the
well
in
the
inner
room
not
one
of
the
narrow
did
they
leave
uninspected
but
they
found
no
black
rats
when
this
floor
was
wholly
in
their
possession
they
began
with
the
same
caution
to
acquire
the
next
then
they
had
to
venture
on
a
bold
and
dangerous
climb
through
the
walls
while
with
breathless
anxiety
they
awaited
an
assault
from
the
enemy
and
although
they
were
tempted
by
the
most
delicious
odour
from
the
grain
bins
they
forced
themselves
most
systematically
to
inspect
the
kitchen
their
stone
table
and
fireplace
the
deep
and
the
hole
in
the
floor
which
in
olden
time
had
been
opened
to
pour
down
boiling
pitch
on
the
intruding
enemy
all
this
time
the
black
rats
were
invisible
the
gray
ones
groped
their
way
to
the
third
story
and
into
the
lord
of
the
castle
great
banquet
hall
which
stood
there
cold
and
empty
like
all
the
other
rooms
in
the
old
house
they
even
groped
their
way
to
the
upper
story
which
had
but
one
big
barren
room
the
only
place
they
did
not
think
of
exploring
was
the
big
on
the
roof
where
just
at
this
time
the
lady
owl
awakened
akka
and
informed
her
that
flammea
the
steeple
owl
had
granted
her
request
and
had
sent
her
the
thing
she
wished
for
since
the
gray
rats
had
so
conscientiously
inspected
the
entire
castle
they
felt
at
ease
they
took
it
for
granted
that
the
black
rats
had
flown
and
did
intend
to
offer
any
resistance
and
with
light
hearts
they
ran
up
into
the
grain
bins
but
the
gray
rats
had
hardly
swallowed
the
first
before
the
sound
of
a
little
shrill
pipe
was
heard
from
the
yard
the
gray
rats
raised
their
heads
listened
anxiously
ran
a
few
steps
as
if
they
intended
to
leave
the
bin
then
they
turned
back
and
began
to
eat
once
more
again
the
pipe
sounded
a
sharp
and
piercing
note
and
now
something
wonderful
happened
one
rat
two
rats
yes
a
whole
lot
of
rats
left
the
grain
jumped
from
the
bins
and
hurried
down
cellar
by
the
shortest
cut
to
get
out
of
the
house
still
there
were
many
gray
rats
left
these
thought
of
all
the
toil
and
trouble
it
had
cost
them
to
win
glimminge
castle
and
they
did
not
want
to
leave
it
but
again
they
caught
the
tones
from
the
pipe
and
had
to
follow
them
with
wild
excitement
they
rushed
up
from
the
bins
slid
down
through
the
narrow
holes
in
the
walls
and
tumbled
over
each
other
in
their
eagerness
to
get
out
in
the
middle
of
the
courtyard
stood
a
tiny
creature
who
blew
upon
a
pipe
all
round
him
he
had
a
whole
circle
of
rats
who
listened
to
him
astonished
and
fascinated
and
every
moment
brought
more
once
he
took
the
pipe
from
his
lips
only
for
a
second
put
his
thumb
to
his
nose
and
wiggled
his
fingers
at
the
gray
rats
and
then
it
looked
as
if
they
wanted
to
throw
themselves
on
him
and
bite
him
to
death
but
as
soon
as
he
blew
on
his
pipe
they
were
in
his
power
when
the
tiny
creature
had
played
all
the
gray
rats
out
of
glimminge
castle
he
began
to
wander
slowly
from
the
courtyard
out
on
the
highway
and
all
the
gray
rats
followed
him
because
the
tones
from
that
pipe
sounded
so
sweet
to
their
ears
that
they
could
not
resist
them
the
tiny
creature
walked
before
them
and
charmed
them
along
with
him
on
the
road
to
vallby
he
led
them
into
all
sorts
of
crooks
and
turns
and
bends
on
through
hedges
and
down
into
ditches
and
wherever
he
went
they
had
to
follow
he
blew
continuously
on
his
pipe
which
appeared
to
be
made
from
an
animal
horn
although
the
horn
was
so
small
that
in
our
days
there
were
no
animals
from
whose
foreheads
it
could
have
been
broken
no
one
knew
either
who
had
made
it
flammea
the
had
found
it
in
a
niche
in
lund
cathedral
she
had
shown
it
to
bataki
the
raven
and
they
had
both
figured
out
that
this
was
the
kind
of
horn
that
was
used
in
former
times
by
those
who
wished
to
gain
power
over
rats
and
mice
but
the
raven
was
akka
friend
and
it
was
from
him
she
had
learned
that
flammea
owned
a
treasure
like
this
and
it
was
true
that
the
rats
could
not
resist
the
pipe
the
boy
walked
before
them
and
played
as
long
as
the
starlight
lasted
and
all
the
while
they
followed
him
he
played
at
daybreak
he
played
at
sunrise
and
the
whole
time
the
entire
procession
of
gray
rats
followed
him
and
were
enticed
farther
and
farther
away
from
the
big
grain
loft
at
glimminge
castle
the
great
crane
dance
on
kullaberg
march
although
there
are
many
magnificent
buildings
in
skåne
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
there
not
one
among
them
that
has
such
pretty
walls
as
old
kullaberg
kullaberg
is
low
and
rather
long
it
is
not
by
any
means
a
big
or
imposing
mountain
on
its
broad
summit
you
find
woods
and
grain
fields
and
one
and
another
here
and
there
round
and
barren
cliffs
rise
up
it
is
not
especially
pretty
up
there
it
looks
a
good
deal
like
all
the
other
upland
places
in
skåne
he
who
walks
along
the
path
which
runs
across
the
middle
of
the
mountain
ca
help
feeling
a
little
disappointed
then
he
happens
perhaps
to
turn
away
from
the
path
and
wanders
off
toward
the
mountain
sides
and
looks
down
over
the
bluffs
and
then
all
at
once
he
will
discover
so
much
that
is
worth
seeing
he
hardly
knows
how
find
time
to
take
in
the
whole
of
it
for
it
happens
that
kullaberg
does
not
stand
on
the
land
with
plains
and
valleys
around
it
like
other
mountains
but
it
has
plunged
into
the
sea
as
far
out
as
it
could
get
not
even
the
tiniest
strip
of
land
lies
below
the
mountain
to
protect
it
against
the
breakers
but
these
reach
all
the
way
up
to
the
mountain
walls
and
can
polish
and
mould
them
to
suit
themselves
this
is
why
the
walls
stand
there
as
richly
ornamented
as
the
sea
and
its
helpmeet
the
wind
have
been
able
to
effect
you
find
steep
ravines
that
are
deeply
chiselled
in
the
mountain
sides
and
black
crags
that
have
become
smooth
and
shiny
under
the
constant
lashing
of
the
winds
there
are
solitary
that
spring
right
up
out
of
the
water
and
dark
grottoes
with
narrow
entrances
there
are
barren
perpendicular
precipices
and
soft
inclines
there
are
small
points
and
small
inlets
and
small
rolling
stones
that
are
rattlingly
washed
up
and
down
with
every
dashing
breaker
there
are
majestic
that
project
over
the
water
there
are
sharp
stones
that
are
constantly
sprayed
by
a
white
foam
and
others
that
mirror
themselves
in
unchangeable
still
water
there
are
giant
shaped
in
the
rock
and
great
crevices
that
lure
the
wanderer
to
venture
into
the
mountain
depths
all
the
way
to
kullman
hollow
and
over
and
around
all
these
cliffs
and
rocks
crawl
entangled
tendrils
and
weeds
trees
grow
there
also
but
the
wind
power
is
so
great
that
trees
have
to
transform
themselves
into
clinging
vines
that
they
may
get
a
firm
hold
on
the
steep
precipices
the
oaks
creep
along
on
the
ground
while
their
foliage
hangs
over
them
like
a
low
ceiling
and
beeches
stand
in
the
ravines
like
great
these
remarkable
mountain
walls
with
the
blue
sea
beneath
them
and
the
clear
penetrating
air
above
them
is
what
makes
kullaberg
so
dear
to
the
people
that
great
crowds
of
them
haunt
the
place
every
day
as
long
as
the
summer
lasts
but
it
is
more
difficult
to
tell
what
it
is
that
makes
it
so
attractive
to
animals
that
every
year
they
gather
there
for
a
big
this
is
a
custom
that
has
been
observed
since
time
immemorial
and
one
should
have
been
there
when
the
first
was
dashed
into
foam
against
the
shore
to
be
able
to
explain
just
why
kullaberg
was
chosen
as
a
rendezvous
in
preference
to
all
other
places
when
the
meeting
is
to
take
place
the
stags
and
roebucks
and
hares
and
foxes
and
all
the
other
make
the
journey
to
kullaberg
the
night
before
so
as
not
to
be
observed
by
the
human
beings
just
before
sunrise
they
all
march
up
to
the
playground
which
is
a
on
the
left
side
of
the
road
and
not
very
far
from
the
mountain
most
extreme
point
the
playground
is
inclosed
on
all
sides
by
round
knolls
which
conceal
it
from
any
and
all
who
do
not
happen
to
come
right
upon
it
and
in
the
month
of
march
it
is
not
at
all
likely
that
any
pedestrians
will
stray
off
up
there
all
the
strangers
who
usually
stroll
around
on
the
rocks
and
clamber
up
the
mountain
sides
the
fall
storms
have
driven
away
these
many
months
past
and
the
lighthouse
keeper
out
there
on
the
point
the
old
fru
on
the
mountain
farm
and
the
mountain
peasant
and
his
go
their
accustomed
ways
and
do
not
run
about
on
the
desolate
when
the
have
arrived
on
the
playground
they
take
their
places
on
the
round
knolls
each
animal
family
keeps
to
itself
although
it
is
understood
that
on
a
day
like
this
universal
peace
reigns
and
no
one
need
fear
attack
on
this
day
a
little
hare
might
wander
over
to
the
foxes
hill
without
losing
as
much
as
one
of
his
long
ears
but
still
the
animals
arrange
themselves
into
separate
groups
this
is
an
old
custom
after
they
have
all
taken
their
places
they
begin
to
look
around
for
the
birds
it
is
always
beautiful
weather
on
this
day
the
cranes
are
good
weather
prophets
and
would
not
call
the
animals
together
if
they
expected
rain
although
the
air
is
clear
and
nothing
obstructs
the
vision
the
see
no
birds
this
is
strange
the
sun
stands
high
in
the
heavens
and
the
birds
should
already
be
on
their
way
but
what
the
animals
on
the
other
hand
observe
is
one
and
another
little
dark
cloud
that
comes
slowly
forward
over
the
plain
and
look
one
of
these
clouds
comes
gradually
along
the
coast
of
öresund
and
up
toward
kullaberg
when
the
cloud
has
come
just
over
the
playground
it
stops
and
simultaneously
the
entire
cloud
begins
to
ring
and
chirp
as
if
it
was
made
of
nothing
but
tone
it
rises
and
sinks
rises
and
sinks
but
all
the
while
it
rings
and
chirps
at
last
the
whole
cloud
falls
down
over
a
knoll
all
at
once
and
the
next
instant
the
knoll
is
entirely
covered
with
gray
larks
pretty
bulfinches
speckled
starlings
and
titmice
soon
after
that
another
cloud
comes
over
the
plain
this
stops
over
every
bit
of
land
over
peasant
cottage
and
palace
over
towns
and
cities
over
farms
and
railway
stations
over
fishing
hamlets
and
sugar
refineries
every
time
it
stops
it
draws
to
itself
a
little
whirling
column
of
gray
from
the
ground
in
this
way
it
grows
and
grows
and
at
last
when
it
is
all
gathered
up
and
heads
for
kullaberg
it
is
no
longer
a
cloud
but
a
whole
mist
which
is
so
big
that
it
throws
a
shadow
on
the
ground
all
the
way
from
höganäs
to
mölle
when
it
stops
over
the
playground
it
hides
the
sun
and
for
a
long
while
it
had
to
rain
gray
sparrows
on
one
of
the
knolls
before
those
who
had
been
flying
in
the
innermost
part
of
the
mist
could
again
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
daylight
but
still
the
biggest
of
these
is
the
one
which
now
appears
this
has
been
formed
of
birds
who
have
travelled
from
every
direction
to
join
it
it
is
dark
and
no
can
penetrate
it
it
is
full
of
the
ghastliest
noises
the
most
frightful
shrieks
the
grimmest
laughter
and
most
croaking
all
on
the
playground
are
glad
when
it
finally
resolves
itself
into
a
storm
of
fluttering
and
croaking
of
crows
and
jackdaws
and
rooks
and
ravens
thereupon
not
only
clouds
are
seen
in
the
heavens
but
a
variety
of
stripes
and
figures
then
straight
dotted
lines
appear
in
the
east
and
northeast
these
are
from
göinge
districts
black
grouse
and
wood
grouse
who
come
flying
in
long
lines
a
couple
of
metres
apart
that
live
around
måkläppen
just
out
of
falsterbo
now
come
floating
over
öresund
in
many
extraordinary
figures
in
triangular
and
long
curves
in
sharp
hooks
and
semicircles
to
the
great
reunion
held
the
year
that
nils
holgersson
travelled
around
with
the
wild
geese
came
akka
and
her
flock
later
than
all
the
others
and
that
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
for
akka
had
to
fly
over
the
whole
of
skåne
to
get
to
kullaberg
beside
as
soon
as
she
awoke
she
had
been
obliged
to
go
out
and
hunt
for
thumbietot
who
for
many
hours
had
gone
and
played
to
the
gray
rats
and
lured
them
far
away
from
glimminge
castle
owl
had
returned
with
the
news
that
the
black
rats
would
be
at
home
immediately
after
sunrise
and
there
was
no
longer
any
danger
in
letting
the
pipe
be
hushed
and
to
give
the
gray
rats
the
liberty
to
go
where
they
pleased
but
it
was
not
akka
who
discovered
the
boy
where
he
walked
with
his
long
following
and
quickly
sank
down
over
him
and
caught
him
with
the
bill
and
swung
into
the
air
with
him
but
it
was
herr
ermenrich
the
stork
for
herr
ermenrich
had
also
gone
out
to
look
for
him
and
after
he
had
borne
him
up
to
the
he
begged
his
forgiveness
for
having
treated
him
with
disrespect
the
evening
before
this
pleased
the
boy
immensely
and
the
stork
and
he
became
good
friends
akka
too
showed
him
that
she
felt
very
kindly
toward
him
she
stroked
her
old
head
several
times
against
his
arms
and
commended
him
because
he
had
helped
those
who
were
in
trouble
but
this
one
must
say
to
the
boy
credit
that
he
did
not
want
to
accept
praise
which
he
had
not
earned
no
mother
akka
he
said
you
must
think
that
i
lured
the
gray
rats
away
to
help
the
black
ones
i
only
wanted
to
show
herr
ermenrich
that
i
was
of
some
consequence
he
had
hardly
said
this
before
akka
turned
to
the
stork
and
asked
if
he
thought
it
was
advisable
to
take
thumbietot
along
to
kullaberg
i
mean
that
we
can
rely
on
him
as
upon
ourselves
said
she
the
stork
at
once
advised
most
enthusiastically
that
thumbietot
be
permitted
to
come
along
certainly
you
shall
take
thumbietot
along
to
kullaberg
mother
akka
said
he
it
is
fortunate
for
us
that
we
can
repay
him
for
all
that
he
has
endured
this
night
for
our
sakes
and
since
it
still
grieves
me
to
think
that
i
did
not
conduct
myself
in
a
becoming
manner
toward
him
the
other
evening
it
is
i
who
will
carry
him
on
my
back
all
the
way
to
the
meeting
place
there
is
much
that
tastes
better
than
to
receive
praise
from
those
who
are
themselves
wise
and
capable
and
the
boy
had
certainly
never
felt
so
happy
as
he
did
when
the
wild
goose
and
the
stork
talked
about
him
in
this
way
thus
the
boy
made
the
trip
to
kullaberg
riding
although
he
knew
that
this
was
a
great
honour
it
caused
him
much
anxiety
for
herr
ermenrich
was
a
master
flyer
and
started
off
at
a
very
different
pace
from
the
wild
geese
while
akka
flew
her
straight
way
with
even
the
stork
amused
himself
by
performing
a
lot
of
flying
tricks
now
he
lay
still
in
an
immeasurable
height
and
floated
in
the
air
without
moving
his
wings
now
he
flung
himself
downward
with
such
sudden
haste
that
it
seemed
as
though
he
would
fall
to
the
ground
helpless
as
a
stone
now
he
had
lots
of
fun
flying
all
around
akka
in
great
and
small
circles
like
a
whirlwind
the
boy
had
never
been
on
a
ride
of
this
sort
before
and
although
he
sat
there
all
the
while
in
terror
he
had
to
acknowledge
to
himself
that
he
had
never
before
known
what
a
good
flight
meant
only
a
single
pause
was
made
during
the
journey
and
that
was
at
vomb
lake
when
akka
joined
her
travelling
companions
and
called
to
them
that
the
gray
rats
had
been
vanquished
after
that
the
travellers
flew
straight
to
kullaberg
there
they
descended
to
the
knoll
reserved
for
the
wild
geese
and
as
the
boy
let
his
glance
wander
from
knoll
to
knoll
he
saw
on
one
of
them
the
antlers
of
the
stags
and
on
another
the
gray
one
knoll
was
red
with
foxes
one
was
gray
with
rats
one
was
covered
with
black
ravens
who
shrieked
continually
one
with
larks
who
simply
could
keep
still
but
kept
on
throwing
themselves
in
the
air
and
singing
for
very
joy
just
as
it
has
ever
been
the
custom
on
kullaberg
it
was
the
crows
who
began
the
day
games
and
frolics
with
their
they
divided
themselves
into
two
flocks
that
flew
toward
each
other
met
turned
and
began
all
over
again
this
dance
had
many
repetitions
and
appeared
to
the
spectators
who
were
not
familiar
with
the
dance
as
altogether
too
monotonous
the
crows
were
very
proud
of
their
dance
but
all
the
others
were
glad
when
it
was
over
it
appeared
to
the
animals
about
as
gloomy
and
meaningless
as
the
play
with
the
it
depressed
them
to
watch
it
and
they
waited
eagerly
for
something
that
should
give
them
a
little
pleasure
they
did
not
have
to
wait
in
vain
either
for
as
soon
as
the
crows
had
finished
the
hares
came
running
they
dashed
forward
in
a
long
row
without
any
apparent
order
in
some
of
the
figures
one
single
hare
came
in
others
they
ran
three
and
four
abreast
they
had
all
raised
themselves
on
two
legs
and
they
rushed
forward
with
such
rapidity
that
their
long
ears
swayed
in
all
directions
as
they
ran
they
spun
round
made
high
leaps
and
beat
their
forepaws
against
their
so
that
they
rattled
some
performed
a
long
succession
of
somersaults
others
doubled
themselves
up
and
rolled
over
like
wheels
one
stood
on
one
leg
and
swung
round
one
walked
upon
his
forepaws
there
was
no
regulation
whatever
but
there
was
much
that
was
droll
in
the
hares
play
and
the
many
animals
who
stood
and
watched
them
began
to
breathe
faster
now
it
was
spring
joy
and
rapture
were
advancing
winter
was
over
summer
was
coming
soon
it
was
only
play
to
live
when
the
hares
had
romped
themselves
out
it
was
the
great
forest
turn
to
perform
hundreds
of
in
shining
array
and
with
bright
red
eyebrows
flung
themselves
up
into
a
great
oak
that
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
playground
the
one
who
sat
upon
the
topmost
branch
fluffed
up
his
feathers
lowered
his
wings
and
lifted
his
tail
so
that
the
white
were
seen
thereupon
he
stretched
his
neck
and
sent
forth
a
couple
of
deep
notes
from
his
thick
throat
tjack
tjack
tjack
it
sounded
more
than
this
he
could
not
utter
it
only
gurgled
a
few
times
way
down
in
the
throat
then
he
closed
his
eyes
and
whispered
sis
sis
sis
hear
how
pretty
sis
sis
sis
at
the
same
time
he
fell
into
such
an
ecstasy
that
he
no
longer
knew
what
was
going
on
around
him
while
the
first
wood
grouse
was
sissing
the
three
nearest
under
him
began
to
sing
and
before
they
had
finished
their
song
the
ten
who
sat
lower
down
joined
in
and
thus
it
continued
from
branch
to
branch
until
the
entire
hundred
grouse
sang
and
gurgled
and
sissed
they
all
fell
into
the
same
ecstasy
during
their
song
and
this
affected
the
other
animals
like
a
contagious
transport
lately
the
blood
had
flowed
lightly
and
agreeably
now
it
began
to
grow
heavy
and
hot
yes
this
is
surely
spring
thought
all
the
animal
folk
winter
chill
has
vanished
the
fires
of
spring
burn
over
the
earth
when
the
black
grouse
saw
that
the
brown
grouse
were
having
such
success
they
could
no
longer
keep
quiet
as
there
was
no
tree
for
them
to
light
on
they
rushed
down
on
the
playground
where
the
heather
stood
so
high
that
only
their
beautifully
turned
and
their
thick
bills
were
visible
and
they
began
to
sing
orr
orr
orr
just
as
the
black
grouse
began
to
compete
with
the
brown
grouse
something
unprecedented
happened
while
all
the
animals
thought
of
nothing
but
the
a
fox
stole
slowly
over
to
the
wild
knoll
he
glided
very
cautiously
and
came
way
up
on
the
knoll
before
anyone
noticed
him
suddenly
a
goose
caught
sight
of
him
and
as
she
could
not
believe
that
a
fox
had
sneaked
in
among
the
geese
for
any
good
purpose
she
began
to
cry
have
a
care
wild
geese
have
a
care
the
fox
struck
her
across
the
throat
mostly
perhaps
because
he
wanted
to
make
her
keep
quiet
but
the
wild
geese
had
already
heard
the
cry
and
they
all
raised
themselves
in
the
air
and
when
they
had
flown
up
the
animals
saw
smirre
fox
standing
on
the
wild
geese
knoll
with
a
dead
goose
in
his
mouth
but
because
he
had
in
this
way
broken
the
peace
such
a
punishment
was
meted
out
to
smirre
fox
that
for
the
rest
of
his
days
he
must
regret
he
had
not
been
able
to
control
his
thirst
for
revenge
but
had
attempted
to
approach
akka
and
her
flock
in
this
manner
he
was
immediately
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
foxes
and
doomed
in
accordance
with
an
old
custom
which
demands
that
whosoever
disturbs
the
peace
on
the
great
must
go
into
exile
not
a
fox
wished
to
lighten
the
sentence
since
they
all
knew
that
the
instant
they
attempted
anything
of
the
sort
they
would
be
driven
from
the
playground
and
would
nevermore
be
permitted
to
enter
it
banishment
was
pronounced
upon
smirre
without
opposition
he
was
forbidden
to
remain
in
skåne
he
was
banished
from
wife
and
kindred
from
hunting
grounds
home
resting
places
and
retreats
which
he
had
hitherto
owned
and
he
must
tempt
fortune
in
foreign
lands
so
that
all
foxes
in
skåne
should
know
that
smirre
was
outlawed
in
the
district
the
oldest
of
the
foxes
bit
off
his
right
earlap
as
soon
as
this
was
done
all
the
young
foxes
began
to
yowl
from
and
threw
themselves
on
smirre
for
him
there
was
no
alternative
except
to
take
flight
and
with
all
the
young
foxes
in
hot
pursuit
he
rushed
away
from
kullaberg
all
this
happened
while
black
grouse
and
brown
grouse
were
going
on
with
their
games
but
these
birds
lose
themselves
so
completely
in
their
song
that
they
neither
hear
nor
see
nor
had
they
permitted
themselves
to
be
disturbed
the
forest
birds
contest
was
barely
over
before
the
stags
from
häckeberga
came
forward
to
show
their
wrestling
game
there
were
several
pairs
of
stags
who
fought
at
the
same
time
they
rushed
at
each
other
with
tremendous
force
struck
their
antlers
dashingly
together
so
that
their
points
were
entangled
and
tried
to
force
each
other
backward
the
were
torn
up
beneath
their
hoofs
the
breath
came
like
smoke
from
their
nostrils
out
of
their
throats
strained
hideous
bellowings
and
the
froth
oozed
down
on
their
shoulders
on
the
knolls
round
about
there
was
breathless
silence
while
the
skilled
clinched
in
all
the
animals
new
emotions
were
awakened
each
and
all
felt
courageous
and
strong
enlivened
by
returning
powers
born
again
with
the
spring
sprightly
and
ready
for
all
kinds
of
adventures
they
felt
no
enmity
toward
each
other
although
everywhere
wings
were
lifted
raised
and
claws
sharpened
if
the
stags
from
häckeberga
had
continued
another
instant
a
wild
struggle
would
have
arisen
on
the
knolls
for
all
had
been
gripped
with
a
burning
desire
to
show
that
they
too
were
full
of
life
because
the
impotence
was
over
and
strength
surged
through
their
bodies
but
the
stags
stopped
wrestling
just
at
the
right
moment
and
instantly
a
whisper
went
from
knoll
to
knoll
the
cranes
are
coming
and
then
came
the
gray
birds
with
plumes
in
their
wings
and
red
on
their
necks
the
big
birds
with
their
tall
legs
their
slender
throats
their
small
heads
came
gliding
down
the
knoll
with
an
abandon
that
was
full
of
mystery
as
they
glided
forward
they
swung
round
half
flying
half
dancing
with
wings
gracefully
lifted
they
moved
with
an
inconceivable
rapidity
there
was
something
marvellous
and
strange
about
their
dance
it
was
as
though
gray
shadows
had
played
a
game
which
the
eye
could
scarcely
follow
it
was
as
if
they
had
learned
it
from
the
mists
that
hover
over
desolate
morasses
there
was
witchcraft
in
it
all
those
who
had
never
before
been
on
kullaberg
understood
why
the
whole
meeting
took
its
name
from
the
crane
dance
there
was
wildness
in
it
but
yet
the
feeling
which
it
awakened
was
a
delicious
longing
no
one
thought
any
more
about
struggling
instead
both
the
winged
and
those
who
had
no
wings
all
wanted
to
raise
themselves
eternally
lift
themselves
above
the
clouds
seek
that
which
was
hidden
beyond
them
leave
the
oppressive
body
that
dragged
them
down
to
earth
and
soar
away
toward
the
infinite
such
longing
after
the
unattainable
after
the
hidden
mysteries
back
of
this
life
the
animals
felt
only
once
a
year
and
this
was
on
the
day
when
they
beheld
the
great
crane
dance
in
rainy
weather
march
it
was
the
first
rainy
day
of
the
trip
as
long
as
the
wild
geese
had
remained
in
the
vicinity
of
vomb
lake
they
had
had
beautiful
weather
but
on
the
day
when
they
set
out
to
travel
farther
north
it
began
to
rain
and
for
several
hours
the
boy
had
to
sit
on
the
soaking
wet
and
shivering
with
the
cold
in
the
morning
when
they
started
it
had
been
clear
and
mild
the
wild
geese
had
flown
high
up
in
the
air
evenly
and
without
haste
with
akka
at
the
head
maintaining
strict
discipline
and
the
rest
in
two
oblique
lines
back
of
her
they
had
not
taken
the
time
to
shout
any
witty
sarcasms
to
the
animals
on
the
ground
but
as
it
was
simply
impossible
for
them
to
keep
perfectly
silent
they
sang
out
continually
in
rhythm
with
the
their
usual
coaxing
call
where
are
you
here
am
i
where
are
you
here
am
i
they
all
took
part
in
this
persistent
calling
and
only
stopped
now
and
then
to
show
the
the
landmarks
they
were
travelling
over
the
places
on
this
route
included
linderödsosen
dry
hills
manor
christianstad
church
steeple
bäckaskog
royal
castle
on
the
narrow
isthmus
between
oppmann
lake
and
ivö
lake
ryss
steep
precipice
it
had
been
a
monotonous
trip
and
when
the
made
their
appearance
the
boy
thought
it
was
a
real
diversion
in
the
old
days
when
he
had
only
seen
a
from
below
he
had
imagined
that
they
were
gray
and
disagreeable
but
it
was
a
very
different
thing
to
be
up
amongst
them
now
he
saw
distinctly
that
the
clouds
were
enormous
carts
which
drove
through
the
heavens
with
loads
some
of
them
were
piled
up
with
huge
gray
sacks
some
with
barrels
some
were
so
large
that
they
could
hold
a
whole
lake
and
a
few
were
filled
with
big
utensils
and
bottles
which
were
piled
up
to
an
immense
height
and
when
so
many
of
them
had
driven
forward
that
they
filled
the
whole
sky
it
appeared
as
though
someone
had
given
a
signal
for
all
at
once
water
commenced
to
pour
down
over
the
earth
from
utensils
barrels
bottles
and
sacks
just
as
the
first
pattered
against
the
ground
there
arose
such
shouts
of
joy
from
all
the
small
birds
in
groves
and
pastures
that
the
whole
air
rang
with
them
and
the
boy
leaped
high
where
he
sat
now
we
have
rain
rain
gives
us
spring
spring
gives
us
flowers
and
green
leaves
green
leaves
and
flowers
give
us
worms
and
insects
worms
and
insects
give
us
food
and
plentiful
and
good
food
is
the
best
thing
there
is
sang
the
birds
the
wild
geese
too
were
glad
of
the
rain
which
came
to
awaken
the
growing
things
from
their
long
sleep
and
to
drive
holes
in
the
on
the
lakes
they
were
not
able
to
keep
up
that
seriousness
any
longer
but
began
to
send
merry
calls
over
the
neighbourhood
when
they
flew
over
the
big
potato
patches
which
are
so
plentiful
in
the
country
around
christianstad
and
which
still
lay
bare
and
black
they
screamed
wake
up
and
be
useful
here
comes
something
that
will
awaken
you
you
have
idled
long
enough
now
when
they
saw
people
who
hurried
to
get
out
of
the
rain
they
reproved
them
saying
what
are
you
in
such
a
hurry
about
ca
you
see
that
it
raining
and
cookies
it
was
a
big
thick
mist
that
moved
northward
briskly
and
followed
close
upon
the
geese
they
seemed
to
think
that
they
dragged
the
mist
along
with
them
and
just
now
when
they
saw
great
orchards
beneath
them
they
called
out
proudly
here
we
come
with
anemones
here
we
come
with
roses
here
we
come
with
apple
blossoms
and
cherry
buds
here
we
come
with
peas
and
beans
and
turnips
and
cabbages
he
who
wills
can
take
them
he
who
wills
can
take
them
thus
it
had
sounded
while
the
first
showers
fell
and
when
all
were
still
glad
of
the
rain
but
when
it
continued
to
fall
the
whole
afternoon
the
wild
geese
grew
impatient
and
cried
to
the
thirsty
forests
around
ivös
lake
have
you
got
enough
yet
have
you
got
enough
yet
the
heavens
were
growing
grayer
and
grayer
and
the
sun
hid
itself
so
well
that
one
could
imagine
where
it
was
the
rain
fell
faster
and
faster
and
beat
harder
and
harder
against
the
wings
as
it
tried
to
find
its
way
between
the
oily
outside
feathers
into
their
skins
the
earth
was
hidden
by
fogs
lakes
mountains
and
woods
floated
together
in
an
indistinct
maze
and
the
landmarks
could
not
be
distinguished
the
flight
became
slower
and
slower
the
joyful
cries
were
hushed
and
the
boy
felt
the
cold
more
and
more
keenly
but
still
he
had
kept
up
his
courage
as
long
as
he
had
ridden
through
the
air
and
in
the
afternoon
when
they
had
lighted
under
a
little
stunted
pine
in
the
middle
of
a
large
morass
where
all
was
wet
and
all
was
cold
where
some
knolls
were
covered
with
snow
and
others
stood
up
naked
in
a
puddle
of
even
then
he
had
not
felt
discouraged
but
ran
about
in
fine
spirits
and
hunted
for
cranberries
and
frozen
whortleberries
but
then
came
evening
and
darkness
sank
down
on
them
so
close
that
not
even
such
eyes
as
the
boy
could
see
through
it
and
all
the
wilderness
became
so
strangely
grim
and
awful
the
boy
lay
tucked
in
under
the
wing
but
could
not
sleep
because
he
was
cold
and
wet
he
heard
such
a
lot
of
rustling
and
rattling
and
stealthy
steps
and
menacing
voices
that
he
was
and
did
know
where
he
should
go
he
must
go
somewhere
where
there
was
light
and
heat
if
he
was
going
to
be
entirely
scared
to
death
if
i
should
venture
where
there
are
human
beings
just
for
this
night
thought
the
boy
only
so
i
could
sit
by
a
fire
for
a
moment
and
get
a
little
food
i
could
go
back
to
the
wild
geese
before
sunrise
he
crept
from
under
the
wing
and
slid
down
to
the
ground
he
awaken
either
the
or
any
of
the
other
geese
but
stole
silently
and
unobserved
through
the
morass
he
did
know
exactly
where
on
earth
he
was
if
he
was
in
skåne
in
småland
or
in
blekinge
but
just
before
he
had
gotten
down
in
the
morass
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
large
village
and
thither
he
directed
his
steps
it
was
long
either
before
he
discovered
a
road
and
soon
he
was
on
the
village
street
which
was
long
and
had
planted
trees
on
both
sides
and
was
bordered
with
garden
after
garden
the
boy
had
come
to
one
of
the
big
cathedral
towns
which
are
so
common
on
the
uplands
but
can
hardly
be
seen
at
all
down
in
the
plain
the
houses
were
of
wood
and
very
prettily
constructed
most
of
them
had
gables
and
fronts
edged
with
carved
mouldings
and
glass
doors
with
here
and
there
a
coloured
pane
opening
on
verandas
the
walls
were
painted
in
light
the
doors
and
shone
in
blues
and
greens
and
even
in
reds
while
the
boy
walked
about
and
viewed
the
houses
he
could
hear
all
the
way
out
to
the
road
how
the
people
who
sat
in
the
warm
cottages
chattered
and
laughed
the
words
he
could
not
distinguish
but
he
thought
it
was
just
lovely
to
hear
human
voices
i
wonder
what
they
would
say
if
i
knocked
and
begged
to
be
let
in
thought
he
this
was
of
course
what
he
had
intended
to
do
all
along
but
now
that
he
saw
the
lighted
windows
his
fear
of
the
darkness
was
gone
instead
he
felt
again
that
shyness
which
always
came
over
him
now
when
he
was
near
human
beings
i
take
a
look
around
the
town
for
a
while
longer
thought
he
before
i
ask
anyone
to
take
me
in
on
one
house
there
was
a
balcony
and
just
as
the
boy
walked
by
the
doors
were
thrown
open
and
a
yellow
light
streamed
through
the
fine
sheer
curtains
then
a
pretty
young
fru
came
out
on
the
balcony
and
leaned
over
the
railing
it
raining
now
we
shall
soon
have
spring
said
she
when
the
boy
saw
her
he
felt
a
strange
anxiety
it
was
as
though
he
wanted
to
weep
for
the
first
time
he
was
a
bit
uneasy
because
he
had
shut
himself
out
from
the
human
kind
shortly
after
that
he
walked
by
a
shop
outside
the
shop
stood
a
red
he
stopped
and
looked
at
it
and
finally
crawled
up
to
the
driver
place
and
seated
himself
when
he
had
got
there
he
smacked
with
his
lips
and
pretended
that
he
sat
and
drove
he
thought
what
fun
it
would
be
to
be
permitted
to
drive
such
a
pretty
machine
over
a
grainfield
for
a
moment
he
forgot
what
he
was
like
now
then
he
remembered
it
and
jumped
down
quickly
from
the
machine
then
a
greater
unrest
came
over
him
after
all
human
beings
were
very
wonderful
and
clever
he
walked
by
the
and
then
he
thought
of
all
the
newspapers
which
came
every
day
with
news
from
all
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
he
saw
the
apothecary
shop
and
the
doctor
home
and
he
thought
about
the
power
of
human
beings
which
was
so
great
that
they
were
able
to
battle
with
sickness
and
death
he
came
to
the
church
then
he
thought
how
human
beings
had
built
it
that
they
might
hear
about
another
world
than
the
one
in
which
they
lived
of
god
and
the
resurrection
and
eternal
life
and
the
longer
he
walked
there
the
better
he
liked
human
beings
it
is
so
with
children
that
they
never
think
any
farther
ahead
than
the
length
of
their
noses
that
which
lies
nearest
them
they
want
promptly
without
caring
what
it
may
cost
them
nils
holgersson
had
not
understood
what
he
was
losing
when
he
chose
to
remain
an
elf
but
now
he
began
to
be
dreadfully
afraid
that
perhaps
he
should
never
again
get
back
to
his
right
form
how
in
all
the
world
should
he
go
to
work
in
order
to
become
human
this
he
wanted
oh
so
much
to
know
he
crawled
up
on
a
doorstep
and
seated
himself
in
the
pouring
rain
and
meditated
he
sat
there
one
whole
hour
two
whole
hours
and
he
thought
so
hard
that
his
forehead
lay
in
furrows
but
he
was
none
the
wiser
it
seemed
as
though
the
thoughts
only
rolled
round
and
round
in
his
head
the
longer
he
sat
there
the
more
impossible
it
seemed
to
him
to
find
any
solution
this
thing
is
certainly
much
too
difficult
for
one
who
has
learned
as
little
as
i
have
he
thought
at
last
it
will
probably
wind
up
by
my
having
to
go
back
among
human
beings
after
all
i
must
ask
the
minister
and
the
doctor
and
the
schoolmaster
and
others
who
are
learned
and
may
know
a
cure
for
such
things
this
he
concluded
that
he
would
do
at
once
and
shook
himself
for
he
was
as
wet
as
a
dog
that
has
been
in
a
just
about
then
he
saw
that
a
big
owl
came
flying
along
and
alighted
on
one
of
the
trees
that
bordered
the
village
street
the
next
instant
a
lady
owl
who
sat
under
the
cornice
of
the
house
began
to
call
out
kivitt
kivitt
are
you
at
home
again
gray
owl
what
kind
of
a
time
did
you
have
abroad
thank
you
lady
brown
owl
i
had
a
very
comfortable
time
said
the
gray
owl
has
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
happened
here
at
home
during
my
absence
not
here
in
blekinge
gray
owl
but
in
skåne
a
marvellous
thing
has
happened
a
boy
has
been
transformed
by
an
elf
into
a
goblin
no
bigger
than
a
squirrel
and
since
then
he
has
gone
to
lapland
with
a
tame
goose
that
a
remarkable
bit
of
news
a
remarkable
bit
of
news
can
he
never
be
human
again
lady
brown
owl
can
he
never
be
human
again
that
a
secret
gray
owl
but
you
shall
hear
it
just
the
same
the
elf
has
said
that
if
the
boy
watches
over
the
so
that
he
comes
home
safe
and
sound
and
what
more
lady
brown
owl
what
more
what
more
fly
with
me
up
to
the
church
tower
gray
owl
and
you
shall
hear
the
whole
story
i
fear
there
may
be
someone
listening
down
here
in
the
street
with
that
the
owls
flew
their
way
but
the
boy
flung
his
cap
in
the
air
and
shouted
if
i
only
watch
over
the
so
that
he
gets
back
safe
and
sound
then
i
shall
become
a
human
being
again
hurrah
hurrah
then
i
shall
become
a
human
being
again
he
shouted
hurrah
until
it
was
strange
that
they
did
not
hear
him
in
the
houses
but
they
did
and
he
hurried
back
to
the
wild
geese
out
in
the
wet
morass
as
fast
as
his
legs
could
carry
him
the
stairway
with
the
three
steps
march
the
following
day
the
wild
geese
intended
to
travel
northward
through
allbo
district
in
småland
they
sent
iksi
and
kaksi
to
spy
out
the
land
but
when
they
returned
they
said
that
all
the
water
was
frozen
and
all
the
land
was
we
may
as
well
remain
where
we
are
said
the
wild
geese
we
can
not
travel
over
a
country
where
there
is
neither
water
nor
food
if
we
remain
where
we
are
we
may
have
to
wait
here
until
the
next
moon
said
akka
it
is
better
to
go
eastward
through
blekinge
and
see
if
we
ca
get
to
småland
by
way
of
möre
which
lies
near
the
coast
and
has
an
early
spring
thus
the
boy
came
to
ride
over
blekinge
the
next
day
now
that
it
was
light
again
he
was
in
a
merry
mood
once
more
and
could
not
comprehend
what
had
come
over
him
the
night
before
he
certainly
did
want
to
give
up
the
journey
and
the
outdoor
life
now
there
lay
a
thick
fog
over
blekinge
the
boy
could
see
how
it
looked
out
there
i
wonder
if
it
is
a
good
or
a
poor
country
that
i
riding
over
thought
he
and
tried
to
search
his
memory
for
the
things
which
he
had
heard
about
the
country
at
school
but
at
the
same
time
he
knew
well
enough
that
this
was
useless
as
he
had
never
been
in
the
habit
of
studying
his
lessons
at
once
the
boy
saw
the
whole
school
before
him
the
children
sat
by
the
little
desks
and
raised
their
hands
the
teacher
sat
in
the
lectern
and
looked
displeased
and
he
himself
stood
before
the
map
and
should
answer
some
question
about
blekinge
but
he
had
a
word
to
say
the
schoolmaster
face
grew
darker
and
darker
for
every
second
that
passed
and
the
boy
thought
the
teacher
was
more
particular
that
they
should
know
their
geography
than
anything
else
now
he
came
down
from
the
lectern
took
the
pointer
from
the
boy
and
sent
him
back
to
his
seat
this
wo
end
well
the
boy
thought
then
but
the
schoolmaster
had
gone
over
to
a
window
and
had
stood
there
for
a
moment
and
looked
out
and
then
he
had
whistled
to
himself
once
then
he
had
gone
up
into
the
lectern
and
said
that
he
would
tell
them
something
about
blekinge
and
that
which
he
then
talked
about
had
been
so
amusing
that
the
boy
had
listened
when
he
only
stopped
and
thought
for
a
moment
he
remembered
every
word
småland
is
a
tall
house
with
spruce
trees
on
the
roof
said
the
teacher
and
leading
up
to
it
is
a
broad
stairway
with
three
big
steps
and
this
stairway
is
called
blekinge
it
is
a
stairway
that
is
well
constructed
it
stretches
miles
along
the
frontage
of
småland
house
and
anyone
who
wishes
to
go
all
the
way
down
to
the
east
sea
by
way
of
the
stairs
has
miles
to
wander
a
good
long
time
must
have
elapsed
since
the
stairway
was
built
both
days
and
years
have
gone
by
since
the
steps
were
hewn
from
gray
stones
and
laid
down
evenly
and
smoothly
for
a
convenient
track
between
småland
and
the
east
sea
since
the
stairway
is
so
old
one
can
of
course
understand
that
it
does
look
just
the
same
now
as
it
did
when
it
was
new
i
do
know
how
much
they
troubled
themselves
about
such
matters
at
that
time
but
big
as
it
was
no
broom
could
have
kept
it
clean
after
a
couple
of
years
moss
and
lichen
began
to
grow
on
it
in
the
autumn
dry
leaves
and
dry
grass
blew
down
over
it
and
in
the
spring
it
was
piled
up
with
falling
stones
and
gravel
and
as
all
these
things
were
left
there
to
mould
they
finally
gathered
so
much
soil
on
the
steps
that
not
only
herbs
and
grass
but
even
bushes
and
trees
could
take
root
there
but
at
the
same
time
a
great
disparity
has
arisen
between
the
three
steps
the
topmost
step
which
lies
nearest
småland
is
mostly
covered
with
poor
soil
and
small
stones
and
no
trees
except
birches
and
and
spruce
which
can
stand
the
cold
on
the
heights
and
are
satisfied
with
little
can
thrive
up
there
one
understands
best
how
poor
and
dry
it
is
there
when
one
sees
how
small
the
are
that
are
ploughed
up
from
the
forest
lands
and
how
many
little
cabins
the
people
build
for
themselves
and
how
far
it
is
between
the
churches
but
on
the
middle
step
there
is
better
soil
and
it
does
not
lie
bound
down
under
such
severe
cold
either
this
one
can
see
at
a
glance
since
the
trees
are
both
higher
and
of
finer
quality
there
you
find
maple
and
oak
and
linden
and
and
hazel
trees
growing
but
no
to
speak
of
and
it
is
still
more
noticeable
because
of
the
amount
of
cultivated
land
that
you
will
find
there
and
also
because
the
people
have
built
themselves
great
and
beautiful
houses
on
the
middle
step
there
are
many
churches
with
large
towns
around
them
and
in
every
way
it
makes
a
better
and
finer
appearance
than
the
top
step
but
the
very
lowest
step
is
the
best
of
all
it
is
covered
with
good
rich
soil
and
where
it
lies
and
bathes
in
the
sea
it
has
the
slightest
feeling
of
the
småland
chill
beeches
and
chestnut
and
walnut
trees
thrive
down
here
and
they
grow
so
big
that
they
tower
above
the
here
lie
also
the
largest
but
the
people
have
not
only
timber
and
farming
to
live
upon
but
they
are
also
occupied
with
fishing
and
trading
and
seafaring
for
this
reason
you
will
find
the
most
costly
residences
and
the
prettiest
churches
here
and
the
parishes
have
developed
into
villages
and
cities
but
this
is
not
all
that
is
said
of
the
three
steps
for
one
must
realise
that
when
it
rains
on
the
roof
of
the
big
småland
house
or
when
the
snow
melts
up
there
the
water
has
to
go
somewhere
and
then
naturally
a
lot
of
it
is
spilled
over
the
big
stairway
in
the
beginning
it
probably
oozed
over
the
whole
stairway
big
as
it
was
then
cracks
appeared
in
it
and
gradually
the
water
has
accustomed
itself
to
flow
alongside
of
it
in
well
grooves
and
water
is
water
whatever
one
does
with
it
it
never
has
any
rest
in
one
place
it
cuts
and
files
away
and
in
another
it
adds
to
those
grooves
it
has
dug
into
vales
and
the
walls
of
the
vales
it
has
decked
with
soil
and
bushes
and
trees
and
vines
have
clung
to
them
ever
since
so
thick
and
in
such
profusion
that
they
almost
hide
the
stream
of
water
that
winds
its
way
down
there
in
the
deep
but
when
the
streams
come
to
the
landings
between
the
steps
they
throw
themselves
headlong
over
them
this
is
why
the
water
comes
with
such
a
seething
rush
that
it
gathers
strength
with
which
to
move
and
machinery
these
too
have
sprung
up
by
every
waterfall
but
this
does
not
tell
all
that
is
said
of
the
land
with
the
three
steps
it
must
also
be
told
that
up
in
the
big
house
in
småland
there
lived
once
upon
a
time
a
giant
who
had
grown
very
old
and
it
fatigued
him
in
his
extreme
age
to
be
forced
to
walk
down
that
long
stairway
in
order
to
catch
salmon
from
the
sea
to
him
it
seemed
much
more
suitable
that
the
salmon
should
come
up
to
him
where
he
lived
therefore
he
went
up
on
the
roof
of
his
great
house
and
there
he
stood
and
threw
stones
down
into
the
east
sea
he
threw
them
with
such
force
that
they
flew
over
the
whole
of
blekinge
and
dropped
into
the
sea
and
when
the
stones
came
down
the
salmon
got
so
scared
that
they
came
up
from
the
sea
and
fled
toward
the
blekinge
streams
ran
through
the
rapids
flung
themselves
with
high
leaps
over
the
waterfalls
and
stopped
how
true
this
is
one
can
see
by
the
number
of
islands
and
points
that
lie
along
the
coast
of
blekinge
and
which
are
nothing
in
the
world
but
the
big
stones
that
the
giant
threw
one
can
also
tell
because
the
salmon
always
go
up
in
the
blekinge
streams
and
work
their
way
up
through
rapids
and
still
water
all
the
way
to
småland
that
giant
is
worthy
of
great
thanks
and
much
honour
from
the
blekinge
people
for
salmon
in
the
streams
and
on
the
island
that
means
work
which
gives
food
to
many
of
them
even
to
this
day

neither
the
wild
geese
nor
smirre
fox
had
believed
that
they
should
ever
run
across
each
other
after
they
had
left
skåne
but
now
it
turned
out
so
that
the
wild
geese
happened
to
take
the
route
over
blekinge
and
thither
smirre
fox
had
also
gone
so
far
he
had
kept
himself
in
the
northern
parts
of
the
province
and
since
he
had
not
as
yet
seen
any
manor
parks
or
hunting
grounds
filled
with
game
and
dainty
young
deer
he
was
more
disgruntled
than
he
could
say
one
afternoon
when
smirre
tramped
around
in
the
desolate
forest
district
of
mellanbygden
not
far
from
ronneby
river
he
saw
a
flock
of
wild
geese
fly
through
the
air
instantly
he
observed
that
one
of
the
geese
was
white
and
then
he
knew
of
course
with
whom
he
had
to
deal
smirre
began
immediately
to
hunt
the
geese
just
as
much
for
the
pleasure
of
getting
a
good
square
meal
as
for
the
desire
to
be
avenged
for
all
the
humiliation
that
they
had
heaped
upon
him
he
saw
that
they
flew
eastward
until
they
came
to
ronneby
river
then
they
changed
their
course
and
followed
the
river
toward
the
south
he
understood
that
they
intended
to
seek
a
along
the
and
he
thought
that
he
should
be
able
to
get
hold
of
a
pair
of
them
without
much
trouble
but
when
smirre
finally
discovered
the
place
where
the
wild
geese
had
taken
refuge
he
observed
they
had
chosen
such
a
spot
that
he
could
get
near
ronneby
river
is
any
big
or
important
body
of
water
nevertheless
it
is
just
as
much
talked
of
for
the
sake
of
its
pretty
shores
at
several
points
it
forces
its
way
forward
between
steep
that
stand
upright
out
of
the
water
and
are
entirely
overgrown
with
honeysuckle
and
and
osier
and
there
is
much
that
can
be
more
delightful
than
to
row
out
on
the
little
dark
river
on
a
pleasant
summer
day
and
look
upward
on
all
the
soft
green
that
fastens
itself
to
the
rugged
but
now
when
the
wild
geese
and
smirre
came
to
the
river
it
was
cold
and
blustery
all
the
trees
were
nude
and
there
was
probably
no
one
who
thought
the
least
little
bit
about
whether
the
shore
was
ugly
or
pretty
the
wild
geese
thanked
their
good
fortune
that
they
had
found
a
large
enough
for
them
to
stand
upon
on
a
steep
mountain
wall
in
front
of
them
rushed
the
river
which
was
strong
and
violent
in
the
time
behind
them
they
had
an
impassable
mountain
rock
wall
and
overhanging
branches
screened
them
they
could
have
it
better
the
geese
were
asleep
instantly
but
the
boy
could
get
a
wink
of
sleep
as
soon
as
the
sun
had
disappeared
he
was
seized
with
a
fear
of
the
darkness
and
a
and
he
longed
for
human
beings
where
he
lay
tucked
in
under
the
he
could
see
nothing
and
only
hear
a
little
and
he
thought
if
any
harm
came
to
the
he
could
save
him
noises
and
rustlings
were
heard
from
all
directions
and
he
grew
so
uneasy
that
he
had
to
creep
from
under
the
wing
and
seat
himself
on
the
ground
beside
the
goose
smirre
stood
on
the
mountain
summit
and
looked
down
upon
the
wild
geese
you
may
as
well
give
this
pursuit
up
first
as
last
he
said
to
himself
you
ca
climb
such
a
steep
mountain
you
ca
swim
in
such
a
wild
torrent
and
there
is
the
tiniest
strip
of
land
below
the
mountain
which
leads
to
the
those
geese
are
too
wise
for
you
do
ever
bother
yourself
again
to
hunt
them
but
smirre
like
all
foxes
had
found
it
hard
to
give
up
an
undertaking
already
begun
and
so
he
lay
down
on
the
extremest
point
of
the
mountain
edge
and
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
the
wild
geese
while
he
lay
and
watched
them
he
thought
of
all
the
harm
they
had
done
him
yes
it
was
their
fault
that
he
had
been
driven
from
skåne
and
had
been
obliged
to
move
to
blekinge
he
worked
himself
up
to
such
a
pitch
as
he
lay
there
that
he
wished
the
wild
geese
were
dead
even
if
he
himself
should
not
have
the
satisfaction
of
eating
them
when
smirre
resentment
had
reached
this
height
he
heard
rasping
in
a
large
pine
that
grew
close
to
him
and
saw
a
squirrel
come
down
from
the
tree
hotly
pursued
by
a
marten
neither
of
them
noticed
smirre
and
he
sat
quietly
and
watched
the
chase
which
went
from
tree
to
tree
he
looked
at
the
squirrel
who
moved
among
the
branches
as
lightly
as
though
he
been
able
to
fly
he
looked
at
the
marten
who
was
not
as
skilled
at
climbing
as
the
squirrel
but
who
still
ran
up
and
along
the
branches
just
as
securely
as
if
they
had
been
even
paths
in
the
forest
if
i
could
only
climb
half
as
well
as
either
of
them
thought
the
fox
those
things
down
there
would
sleep
in
peace
very
long
as
soon
as
the
squirrel
had
been
captured
and
the
chase
was
ended
smirre
walked
over
to
the
marten
but
stopped
two
steps
away
from
him
to
signify
that
he
did
not
wish
to
cheat
him
of
his
prey
he
greeted
the
marten
in
a
very
friendly
manner
and
wished
him
good
luck
with
his
catch
smirre
chose
his
words
well
as
foxes
always
do
the
marten
on
the
contrary
who
with
his
long
and
slender
body
his
fine
head
his
soft
skin
and
his
light
brown
looked
like
a
little
marvel
of
beauty
but
in
reality
was
nothing
but
a
crude
forest
dweller
hardly
answered
him
it
surprises
me
said
smirre
that
such
a
fine
hunter
as
you
are
should
be
satisfied
with
chasing
squirrels
when
there
is
much
better
game
within
reach
here
he
paused
but
when
the
marten
only
grinned
impudently
at
him
he
continued
can
it
be
possible
that
you
have
seen
the
wild
geese
that
stand
under
the
mountain
wall
or
are
you
not
a
good
enough
climber
to
get
down
to
them
this
time
he
had
no
need
to
wait
for
an
answer
the
marten
rushed
up
to
him
with
back
bent
and
every
separate
hair
on
end
have
you
seen
wild
geese
he
hissed
where
are
they
tell
me
instantly
or
i
bite
your
neck
off
no
you
must
remember
that
i
twice
your
size
so
be
a
little
polite
i
ask
nothing
better
than
to
show
you
the
wild
geese
the
next
instant
the
marten
was
on
his
way
down
the
steep
and
while
smirre
sat
and
watched
how
he
swung
his
body
from
branch
to
branch
he
thought
that
pretty
has
the
wickedest
heart
in
all
the
forest
i
believe
that
the
wild
geese
will
have
me
to
thank
for
a
bloody
awakening
but
just
as
smirre
was
waiting
to
hear
the
geese
he
saw
the
marten
tumble
from
branch
to
branch
and
plump
into
the
river
so
the
water
splashed
high
soon
thereafter
wings
beat
loudly
and
strongly
and
all
the
geese
went
up
in
a
hurried
flight
smirre
intended
to
hurry
after
the
geese
but
he
was
so
curious
to
know
how
they
had
been
saved
that
he
sat
there
until
the
marten
came
clambering
up
that
poor
thing
was
soaked
in
mud
and
stopped
every
now
and
then
to
rub
his
head
with
his
forepaws
now
was
that
just
what
i
thought
that
you
were
a
booby
and
would
go
and
tumble
into
the
river
said
smirre
contemptuously
i
have
acted
boobyishly
you
do
need
to
scold
me
said
the
marten
i
sat
all
ready
on
one
of
the
lowest
branches
and
thought
how
i
should
manage
to
tear
a
whole
lot
of
geese
to
pieces
when
a
little
creature
no
bigger
than
a
squirrel
jumped
up
and
threw
a
stone
at
my
head
with
such
force
that
i
fell
into
the
water
and
before
i
had
time
to
pick
myself
up
the
marten
did
have
to
say
any
more
he
had
no
audience
smirre
was
already
a
long
way
off
in
pursuit
of
the
wild
geese
in
the
meantime
akka
had
flown
southward
in
search
of
a
new
there
was
still
a
little
daylight
and
beside
the
stood
high
in
the
heavens
so
that
she
could
see
a
little
luckily
she
was
well
acquainted
in
these
parts
because
it
had
happened
more
than
once
that
she
had
been
to
blekinge
when
she
travelled
over
the
east
sea
in
the
spring
she
followed
the
river
as
long
as
she
saw
it
winding
through
the
landscape
like
a
black
shining
snake
in
this
way
she
came
way
down
to
djupafors
where
the
river
first
hides
itself
in
an
underground
channel
and
then
clear
and
transparent
as
though
it
were
made
of
glass
rushes
down
in
a
narrow
cleft
and
breaks
into
bits
against
its
bottom
in
glittering
drops
and
flying
foam
below
the
white
falls
lay
a
few
stones
between
which
the
water
rushed
away
in
a
wild
torrent
cataract
here
mother
akka
alighted
this
was
another
good
especially
this
late
in
the
evening
when
no
human
beings
moved
about
at
sunset
the
geese
would
hardly
have
been
able
to
camp
there
for
djupafors
does
not
lie
in
any
wilderness
on
one
side
of
the
falls
is
a
paper
factory
on
the
other
which
is
steep
and
is
djupadal
park
where
people
are
always
strolling
about
on
the
steep
and
slippery
paths
to
enjoy
the
wild
stream
rushing
movement
down
in
the
ravine
it
was
about
the
same
here
as
at
the
former
place
none
of
the
travellers
thought
the
least
little
bit
that
they
had
come
to
a
pretty
and
place
they
thought
rather
that
it
was
ghastly
and
dangerous
to
stand
and
sleep
on
slippery
wet
stones
in
the
middle
of
a
rumbling
waterfall
but
they
had
to
be
content
if
only
they
were
protected
from
carnivorous
animals
the
geese
fell
asleep
instantly
while
the
boy
could
find
no
rest
in
sleep
but
sat
beside
them
that
he
might
watch
over
the
after
a
while
smirre
came
running
along
the
he
spied
the
geese
immediately
where
they
stood
out
in
the
foaming
whirlpools
and
understood
that
he
could
get
at
them
here
either
still
he
make
up
his
mind
to
abandon
them
but
seated
himself
on
the
shore
and
looked
at
them
he
felt
very
much
humbled
and
thought
that
his
entire
reputation
as
a
hunter
was
at
stake
all
of
a
sudden
he
saw
an
otter
come
creeping
up
from
the
falls
with
a
fish
in
his
mouth
smirre
approached
him
but
stopped
within
two
steps
of
him
to
show
him
that
he
did
wish
to
take
his
game
from
him
you
a
remarkable
one
who
can
content
yourself
with
catching
a
fish
while
the
stones
are
covered
with
geese
said
smirre
he
was
so
eager
that
he
had
taken
the
time
to
arrange
his
words
as
carefully
as
he
was
wont
to
do
the
otter
did
turn
his
head
once
in
the
direction
of
the
river
he
was
a
vagabond
like
all
otters
and
had
fished
many
times
by
vomb
lake
and
probably
knew
smirre
fox
i
know
very
well
how
you
act
when
you
want
to
coax
away
a
smirre
said
he
oh
is
it
you
gripe
said
smirre
and
was
delighted
for
he
knew
that
this
particular
otter
was
a
quick
and
accomplished
swimmer
i
wonder
that
you
do
not
care
to
look
at
the
wild
geese
since
you
manage
to
get
out
to
them
but
the
otter
who
had
between
his
toes
and
a
stiff
tail
which
was
as
good
as
an
oar
and
a
skin
that
was
did
wish
to
have
it
said
of
him
that
there
was
a
waterfall
that
he
was
able
to
manage
he
turned
toward
the
stream
and
as
soon
as
he
caught
sight
of
the
wild
geese
he
threw
the
fish
away
and
rushed
down
the
steep
shore
and
into
the
river
if
it
had
been
a
little
later
in
the
spring
so
that
the
nightingales
in
djupafors
had
been
at
home
they
would
have
sung
for
many
a
day
of
gripe
struggle
with
the
rapid
for
the
otter
was
thrust
back
by
the
waves
many
times
and
carried
down
river
but
he
fought
his
way
steadily
up
again
he
swam
forward
in
still
water
he
crawled
over
stones
and
gradually
came
nearer
the
wild
geese
it
was
a
perilous
trip
which
might
well
have
earned
the
right
to
be
sung
by
the
nightingales
smirre
followed
the
otter
course
with
his
eyes
as
well
as
he
could
at
last
he
saw
that
the
otter
was
in
the
act
of
climbing
up
to
the
wild
geese
but
just
then
it
shrieked
shrill
and
wild
the
otter
tumbled
backward
into
the
water
and
dashed
away
as
if
he
had
been
a
blind
kitten
an
instant
later
there
was
a
great
crackling
of
geese
wings
they
raised
themselves
and
flew
away
to
find
another
the
otter
soon
came
on
land
he
said
nothing
but
commenced
to
lick
one
of
his
forepaws
when
smirre
sneered
at
him
because
he
had
succeeded
he
broke
out
it
was
not
the
fault
of
my
smirre
i
had
raced
all
the
way
over
to
the
geese
and
was
about
to
climb
up
to
them
when
a
tiny
creature
came
running
and
jabbed
me
in
the
foot
with
some
sharp
iron
it
hurt
so
i
lost
my
footing
and
then
the
current
took
me
he
did
have
to
say
any
more
smirre
was
already
far
away
on
his
way
to
the
wild
geese
once
again
akka
and
her
flock
had
to
take
a
night
fly
fortunately
the
moon
had
not
gone
down
and
with
the
aid
of
its
light
she
succeeded
in
finding
another
of
those
which
she
knew
in
that
neighbourhood
again
she
followed
the
shining
river
toward
the
south
over
djupadal
manor
and
over
ronneby
dark
roofs
and
white
waterfalls
she
swayed
forward
without
alighting
but
a
little
south
of
the
city
and
not
far
from
the
sea
lies
ronneby
with
its
bath
house
and
spring
house
with
its
big
hotel
and
summer
cottages
for
the
spring
guests
all
these
stand
empty
and
desolate
in
winter
which
the
birds
know
perfectly
well
and
many
are
the
who
seek
shelter
on
the
deserted
buildings
balustrades
and
balconies
during
hard
here
the
wild
geese
lit
on
a
balcony
and
as
usual
they
fell
asleep
at
once
the
boy
on
the
contrary
could
not
sleep
because
he
had
cared
to
creep
in
under
the
wing
the
balcony
faced
south
so
the
boy
had
an
outlook
over
the
sea
and
since
he
could
not
sleep
he
sat
there
and
saw
how
pretty
it
looked
when
sea
and
land
meet
here
in
blekinge
you
see
that
sea
and
land
can
meet
in
many
different
ways
in
many
places
the
land
comes
down
toward
the
sea
with
flat
tufted
meadows
and
the
sea
meets
the
land
with
flying
sand
which
piles
up
in
mounds
and
drifts
it
appears
as
though
they
both
disliked
each
other
so
much
that
they
only
wished
to
show
the
poorest
they
possessed
but
it
can
also
happen
that
when
the
land
comes
toward
the
sea
it
raises
a
wall
of
hills
in
front
of
it
as
though
the
sea
were
something
dangerous
when
the
land
does
this
the
sea
comes
up
to
it
with
fiery
wrath
and
beats
and
roars
and
lashes
against
the
rocks
and
looks
as
if
it
would
tear
the
to
pieces
but
in
blekinge
it
is
altogether
different
when
sea
and
land
meet
there
the
land
breaks
itself
up
into
points
and
islands
and
islets
and
the
sea
divides
itself
into
fiords
and
bays
and
sounds
and
it
is
perhaps
this
which
makes
it
look
as
if
they
must
meet
in
happiness
and
harmony
think
now
first
and
foremost
of
the
sea
far
out
it
lies
desolate
and
empty
and
big
and
has
nothing
else
to
do
but
to
roll
its
gray
billows
when
it
comes
toward
the
land
it
happens
across
the
first
obstacle
this
it
immediately
overpowers
tears
away
everything
green
and
makes
it
as
gray
as
itself
then
it
meets
still
another
obstacle
with
this
it
does
the
same
thing
and
still
another
yes
the
same
thing
happens
to
this
also
it
is
stripped
and
plundered
as
if
it
had
fallen
into
robbers
hands
then
the
obstacles
come
nearer
and
nearer
together
and
then
the
sea
must
understand
that
the
land
sends
toward
it
her
littlest
children
in
order
to
move
it
to
pity
it
also
becomes
more
friendly
the
farther
in
it
comes
rolls
its
waves
less
high
moderates
its
storms
lets
the
green
things
stay
in
cracks
and
crevices
separates
itself
into
small
sounds
and
inlets
and
becomes
at
last
so
harmless
in
the
land
that
little
boats
dare
venture
out
on
it
it
certainly
can
not
recognise
itself
so
mild
and
friendly
has
it
grown
and
then
think
of
the
hillside
it
lies
uniform
and
looks
the
same
almost
everywhere
it
consists
of
flat
with
one
and
another
between
them
or
else
of
long
stretches
of
forest
ranges
it
appears
as
if
it
had
thought
about
nothing
but
grain
and
turnips
and
potatoes
and
spruce
and
pine
then
comes
a
that
cuts
far
into
it
it
does
mind
that
but
borders
it
with
birch
and
alder
just
as
if
it
was
an
ordinary
lake
then
still
another
wave
comes
driving
in
nor
does
the
hillside
bother
itself
about
cringing
to
this
but
it
too
gets
the
same
covering
as
the
first
one
then
the
fiords
begin
to
broaden
and
separate
they
break
up
fields
and
woods
and
then
the
hillside
can
not
help
but
notice
them
i
believe
it
is
the
sea
itself
that
is
coming
says
the
hillside
and
then
it
begins
to
adorn
itself
it
wreathes
itself
with
blossoms
travels
up
and
down
in
hills
and
throws
islands
into
the
sea
it
no
longer
cares
about
pines
and
spruces
but
casts
them
off
like
old
every
day
clothes
and
parades
later
with
big
oaks
and
lindens
and
chestnuts
and
with
blossoming
leafy
bowers
and
becomes
as
gorgeous
as
a
and
when
it
meets
the
sea
it
is
so
changed
that
it
does
know
itself
all
this
one
can
not
see
very
well
until
summertime
but
at
any
rate
the
boy
observed
how
mild
and
friendly
nature
was
and
he
began
to
feel
calmer
than
he
had
been
before
that
night
then
suddenly
he
heard
a
sharp
and
ugly
yowl
from
the
park
and
when
he
stood
up
he
saw
in
the
white
moonlight
a
fox
standing
on
the
pavement
under
the
balcony
for
smirre
had
followed
the
wild
geese
once
more
but
when
he
had
found
the
place
where
they
were
quartered
he
had
understood
that
it
was
impossible
to
get
at
them
in
any
way
then
he
had
not
been
able
to
keep
from
yowling
with
chagrin
when
the
fox
yowled
in
this
manner
old
akka
the
was
awakened
although
she
could
see
nothing
she
thought
she
recognised
the
voice
is
it
you
who
are
out
smirre
said
she
yes
said
smirre
it
is
i
and
i
want
to
ask
what
you
geese
think
of
the
night
that
i
have
given
you
do
you
mean
to
say
that
it
is
you
who
have
sent
the
marten
and
otter
against
us
asked
akka
a
good
turn
should
be
denied
said
smirre
you
once
played
the
with
me
now
i
have
begun
to
play
the
with
you
and
i
not
inclined
to
let
up
on
it
so
long
as
a
single
one
of
you
still
lives
even
if
i
have
to
follow
you
the
world
over
you
smirre
ought
at
least
to
think
whether
it
is
right
for
you
who
are
weaponed
with
both
teeth
and
claws
to
hound
us
in
this
way
we
who
are
without
defence
said
akka
smirre
thought
that
akka
sounded
scared
and
he
said
quickly
if
you
akka
will
take
that
thumbietot
who
has
so
often
opposed
me
and
throw
him
down
to
me
i
promise
to
make
peace
with
you
then
i
never
more
pursue
you
or
any
of
yours
i
not
going
to
give
you
thumbietot
said
akka
from
the
youngest
of
us
to
the
oldest
we
would
willingly
give
our
lives
for
his
sake
since
you
so
fond
of
him
said
smirre
i
promise
you
that
he
shall
be
the
first
among
you
that
i
will
wreak
vengeance
upon
akka
said
no
more
and
after
smirre
had
sent
up
a
few
more
yowls
all
was
still
the
boy
lay
all
the
while
awake
now
it
was
akka
words
to
the
fox
that
prevented
him
from
sleeping
never
had
he
dreamed
that
he
should
hear
anything
so
great
as
that
anyone
was
willing
to
risk
life
for
his
sake
from
that
moment
it
could
no
longer
be
said
of
nils
holgersson
that
he
did
not
care
for
anyone
karlskrona
april
it
was
a
moonlight
evening
in
karlskrona
calm
and
beautiful
but
earlier
in
the
day
there
had
been
rain
and
wind
and
the
people
must
have
thought
that
the
bad
weather
still
continued
for
hardly
one
of
them
had
ventured
out
on
the
streets
while
the
city
lay
there
so
desolate
akka
the
wild
goose
and
her
flock
came
flying
toward
it
over
vemmön
and
pantarholmen
they
were
out
in
the
late
evening
to
seek
a
sleeping
place
on
the
islands
they
could
remain
inland
because
they
were
disturbed
by
smirre
fox
wherever
they
lighted
when
the
boy
rode
along
high
up
in
the
air
and
looked
at
the
sea
and
the
islands
which
spread
themselves
before
him
he
thought
that
everything
appeared
so
strange
and
the
heavens
were
no
longer
blue
but
encased
him
like
a
globe
of
green
glass
the
sea
was
and
as
far
as
he
could
see
rolled
small
white
waves
tipped
with
silver
ripples
in
the
midst
of
all
this
white
lay
numerous
little
islets
absolutely
coal
black
whether
they
were
big
or
little
whether
they
were
as
even
as
meadows
or
full
of
cliffs
they
looked
just
as
black
even
dwelling
houses
and
churches
and
windmills
which
at
other
times
are
white
or
red
were
outlined
in
black
against
the
green
sky
the
boy
thought
it
was
as
if
the
earth
had
been
transformed
and
he
was
come
to
another
world
he
thought
that
just
for
this
one
night
he
wanted
to
be
brave
and
not
afraid
when
he
saw
something
that
really
frightened
him
it
was
a
high
cliff
island
which
was
covered
with
big
angular
blocks
and
between
the
blocks
shone
specks
of
bright
shining
gold
he
could
keep
from
thinking
of
maglestone
by
which
the
trolls
sometimes
raised
upon
high
gold
pillars
and
he
wondered
if
this
was
something
like
that
but
with
the
stones
and
the
gold
it
might
have
gone
fairly
well
if
such
a
lot
of
horrid
things
had
not
been
lying
all
around
the
island
it
looked
like
whales
and
sharks
and
other
big
but
the
boy
understood
that
it
was
the
who
had
gathered
around
the
island
and
intended
to
crawl
up
on
it
to
fight
with
the
who
lived
there
and
those
on
the
land
were
probably
afraid
for
he
saw
how
a
big
giant
stood
on
the
highest
point
of
the
island
and
raised
his
arms
as
if
in
despair
over
all
the
misfortune
that
should
come
to
him
and
his
island
the
boy
was
not
a
little
terrified
when
he
noticed
that
akka
began
to
descend
right
over
that
particular
island
no
for
pity
sake
we
must
not
light
there
said
he
but
the
geese
continued
to
descend
and
soon
the
boy
was
astonished
that
he
could
have
seen
things
so
awry
in
the
first
place
the
big
stone
blocks
were
nothing
but
houses
the
whole
island
was
a
city
and
the
shining
gold
specks
were
street
lamps
and
lighted
the
giant
who
stood
highest
up
on
the
island
and
raised
his
arms
was
a
church
with
two
all
the
and
monsters
which
he
thought
he
had
seen
were
boats
and
ships
of
every
description
that
lay
anchored
all
around
the
island
on
the
side
which
lay
toward
the
land
were
mostly
and
sailboats
and
small
coast
steamers
but
on
the
side
that
faced
the
sea
lay
battleships
some
were
broad
with
very
thick
slanting
smokestacks
others
were
long
and
narrow
and
so
constructed
that
they
could
glide
through
the
water
like
fishes
now
what
city
might
this
be
that
the
boy
could
figure
out
because
he
saw
all
the
battleships
all
his
life
he
had
loved
ships
although
he
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
any
except
the
galleys
which
he
had
sailed
in
the
road
ditches
he
knew
very
well
that
this
city
where
so
many
battleships
lay
could
be
any
place
but
karlskrona
the
boy
grandfather
had
been
an
old
marine
and
as
long
as
he
had
lived
he
had
talked
of
karlskrona
every
day
of
the
great
warship
dock
and
of
all
the
other
things
to
be
seen
in
that
city
the
boy
felt
perfectly
at
home
and
he
was
glad
that
he
should
see
all
this
of
which
he
had
heard
so
much
but
he
only
had
a
glimpse
of
the
towers
and
fortifications
which
barred
the
entrance
to
the
harbour
and
the
many
buildings
and
the
shipyard
before
akka
came
down
on
one
of
the
flat
this
was
a
pretty
safe
place
for
those
who
wanted
to
get
away
from
a
fox
and
the
boy
began
to
wonder
if
he
could
venture
to
crawl
in
under
the
wing
for
this
one
night
yes
that
he
might
safely
do
it
would
do
him
good
to
get
a
little
sleep
he
should
try
to
see
a
little
more
of
the
dock
and
the
ships
after
it
had
grown
light
the
boy
himself
thought
it
was
strange
that
he
could
keep
still
and
wait
until
the
next
morning
to
see
the
ships
he
certainly
had
not
slept
five
minutes
before
he
slipped
out
from
under
the
wing
and
slid
down
the
and
the
waterspout
all
the
way
down
to
the
ground
soon
he
stood
on
a
big
square
which
spread
itself
in
front
of
the
church
it
was
covered
with
round
stones
and
was
just
as
difficult
for
him
to
travel
over
as
it
is
for
big
people
to
walk
on
a
tufted
meadow
those
who
are
accustomed
to
live
in
the
open
or
way
out
in
the
country
always
feel
uneasy
when
they
come
into
a
city
where
the
houses
stand
straight
and
forbidding
and
the
streets
are
open
so
that
everyone
can
see
who
goes
there
and
it
happened
in
the
same
way
with
the
boy
when
he
stood
on
the
big
karlskrona
square
and
looked
at
the
german
church
and
town
hall
and
the
cathedral
from
which
he
had
just
descended
he
could
do
anything
but
wish
that
he
was
back
on
the
tower
again
with
the
geese
it
was
a
lucky
thing
that
the
square
was
entirely
deserted
there
a
human
being
about
unless
he
counted
a
statue
that
stood
on
a
high
pedestal
the
boy
gazed
long
at
the
statue
which
represented
a
big
brawny
man
in
a
hat
long
waistcoat
and
coarse
shoes
and
wondered
what
kind
of
a
one
he
was
he
held
a
long
stick
in
his
hand
and
he
looked
as
if
he
would
know
how
to
make
use
of
it
too
for
he
had
an
awfully
severe
countenance
with
a
big
hooked
nose
and
an
ugly
mouth
what
is
that
thing
doing
here
said
the
boy
at
last
he
had
never
felt
so
small
and
insignificant
as
he
did
that
night
he
tried
to
jolly
himself
up
a
bit
by
saying
something
audacious
then
he
thought
no
more
about
the
statue
but
betook
himself
to
a
wide
street
which
led
down
to
the
sea
but
the
boy
had
gone
far
before
he
heard
that
someone
was
following
him
someone
was
walking
behind
him
who
stamped
on
the
stone
pavement
with
heavy
footsteps
and
pounded
on
the
ground
with
a
hard
stick
it
sounded
as
if
the
bronze
man
up
in
the
square
had
gone
out
for
a
promenade
the
boy
listened
after
the
steps
while
he
ran
down
the
street
and
he
became
more
and
more
convinced
that
it
was
the
bronze
man
the
ground
trembled
and
the
houses
shook
it
could
be
anyone
but
he
who
walked
so
heavily
and
the
boy
grew
when
he
thought
of
what
he
had
just
said
to
him
he
did
not
dare
to
turn
his
head
to
find
out
if
it
really
was
he
perhaps
he
is
only
out
walking
for
recreation
thought
the
boy
surely
he
ca
be
offended
with
me
for
the
words
i
spoke
they
were
not
at
all
badly
meant
instead
of
going
straight
on
and
trying
to
get
down
to
the
dock
the
boy
turned
into
a
side
street
which
led
east
first
and
foremost
he
wanted
to
get
away
from
the
one
who
tramped
after
him
but
the
next
instant
he
heard
that
the
bronze
man
had
switched
off
to
the
same
street
and
then
the
boy
was
so
scared
that
he
did
know
what
he
would
do
with
himself
and
how
hard
it
was
to
find
any
hiding
places
in
a
city
where
all
the
gates
were
closed
then
he
saw
on
his
right
an
old
frame
church
which
lay
a
short
distance
away
from
the
street
in
the
centre
of
a
large
grove
not
an
instant
did
he
pause
to
consider
but
rushed
on
toward
the
church
if
i
can
only
get
there
then
i
surely
be
shielded
from
all
harm
thought
he
as
he
ran
forward
he
suddenly
caught
sight
of
a
man
who
stood
on
a
gravel
path
and
beckoned
to
him
there
is
certainly
someone
who
will
help
me
thought
the
boy
he
became
intensely
happy
and
hurried
off
in
that
direction
he
was
actually
so
frightened
that
the
heart
of
him
fairly
thumped
in
his
breast
but
when
he
came
up
to
the
man
who
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
gravel
path
upon
a
low
pedestal
he
was
absolutely
thunderstruck
surely
it
have
been
that
one
who
beckoned
to
me
thought
he
for
he
saw
that
the
entire
man
was
made
of
wood
he
stood
there
and
stared
at
him
he
was
a
man
on
short
legs
with
a
broad
ruddy
countenance
shiny
black
hair
and
full
black
beard
on
his
head
he
wore
a
wooden
hat
on
his
body
a
brown
wooden
coat
around
his
waist
a
black
wooden
belt
on
his
legs
he
had
wide
wooden
and
wooden
stockings
and
on
his
feet
black
wooden
shoes
he
was
newly
painted
and
newly
varnished
so
that
he
glistened
and
shone
in
the
moonlight
this
undoubtedly
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
giving
him
such
a
appearance
that
the
boy
at
once
placed
confidence
in
him
in
his
left
hand
he
held
a
wooden
slate
and
there
the
boy
read
humbly
i
beg
you
though
voice
i
may
lack
come
drop
a
penny
do
but
lift
my
hat
oh
ho
the
man
was
only
a
the
boy
felt
that
he
had
been
done
he
had
expected
that
this
should
be
something
really
remarkable
and
now
he
remembered
that
grandpa
had
also
spoken
of
the
wooden
man
and
said
that
all
the
children
in
karlskrona
were
so
fond
of
him
and
that
must
have
been
true
for
he
too
found
it
hard
to
part
with
the
wooden
man
he
had
something
so
about
him
that
one
could
well
take
him
to
be
many
hundred
years
old
and
at
the
same
time
he
looked
so
strong
and
bold
and
animated
just
as
one
might
imagine
that
folks
looked
in
olden
times
the
boy
had
so
much
fun
looking
at
the
wooden
man
that
he
entirely
forgot
the
one
from
whom
he
was
fleeing
but
now
he
heard
him
he
turned
from
the
street
and
came
into
the
churchyard
he
followed
him
here
too
where
should
the
boy
go
just
then
he
saw
the
wooden
man
bend
down
to
him
and
stretch
forth
his
big
broad
hand
it
was
impossible
to
believe
anything
but
good
of
him
and
with
one
jump
the
boy
stood
in
his
hand
the
wooden
man
lifted
him
to
his
hat
and
stuck
him
under
it
the
boy
was
just
hidden
and
the
wooden
man
had
just
gotten
his
arm
in
its
right
place
again
when
the
bronze
man
stopped
in
front
of
him
and
banged
the
stick
on
the
ground
so
that
the
wooden
man
shook
on
his
pedestal
thereupon
the
bronze
man
said
in
a
strong
and
resonant
voice
who
might
this
one
be
the
wooden
man
arm
went
up
so
that
it
creaked
in
the
old
woodwork
and
he
touched
his
hat
brim
as
he
replied
rosenbom
by
your
leave
once
upon
a
time
boatswain
on
the
after
completed
service
sexton
at
the
admiral
church
and
lately
carved
in
wood
and
exhibited
in
the
churchyard
as
a
the
boy
gave
a
start
when
he
heard
that
the
wooden
man
said
your
majesty
for
now
when
he
thought
about
it
he
knew
that
the
statue
on
the
square
represented
the
one
who
had
founded
the
city
it
was
probably
no
less
an
one
than
charles
the
eleventh
himself
whom
he
had
encountered
he
gives
a
good
account
of
himself
said
the
bronze
man
can
he
also
tell
me
if
he
has
seen
a
little
brat
who
runs
around
in
the
city
he
an
impudent
rascal
if
i
get
hold
of
him
i
teach
him
manners
with
that
he
again
pounded
on
the
ground
with
his
stick
and
looked
fearfully
angry
by
your
majesty
leave
i
have
seen
him
said
the
wooden
man
and
the
boy
was
so
scared
that
he
commenced
to
shake
where
he
sat
under
the
hat
and
looked
at
the
bronze
man
through
a
crack
in
the
wood
but
he
calmed
down
when
the
wooden
man
continued
your
majesty
is
on
the
wrong
track
that
youngster
certainly
intended
to
run
into
the
shipyard
and
conceal
himself
there
does
he
say
so
rosenbom
well
then
do
stand
still
on
the
pedestal
any
longer
but
come
with
me
and
help
me
find
him
four
eyes
are
better
than
two
rosenbom
but
the
wooden
man
answered
in
a
doleful
voice
i
would
most
humbly
beg
to
be
permitted
to
stay
where
i
am
i
look
well
and
sleek
because
of
the
paint
but
i
old
and
mouldy
and
can
not
stand
moving
about
the
bronze
man
was
not
one
of
those
who
liked
to
be
contradicted
what
sort
of
notions
are
these
come
along
rosenbom
then
he
raised
his
stick
and
gave
the
other
one
a
resounding
whack
on
the
shoulder
does
rosenbom
not
see
that
he
holds
together
with
that
they
broke
off
and
walked
forward
on
the
streets
of
karlskrona
large
and
mighty
until
they
came
to
a
high
gate
which
led
to
the
shipyard
just
outside
and
on
guard
walked
one
of
the
but
the
bronze
man
strutted
past
him
and
kicked
the
gate
open
without
the
pretending
to
notice
it
as
soon
as
they
had
gotten
into
the
shipyard
they
saw
before
them
a
wide
expansive
harbor
separated
by
in
the
different
harbour
basins
lay
the
warships
which
looked
bigger
and
more
close
to
like
this
than
lately
when
the
boy
had
seen
them
from
up
above
then
it
was
so
crazy
after
all
to
imagine
that
they
were
thought
he
where
does
rosenbom
think
it
most
advisable
for
us
to
begin
the
search
said
the
bronze
man
such
an
one
as
he
could
most
easily
conceal
himself
in
the
hall
of
models
replied
the
wooden
man
on
a
narrow
which
stretched
to
the
right
from
the
gate
all
along
the
harbour
lay
ancient
structures
the
bronze
man
walked
over
to
a
building
with
low
walls
small
windows
and
a
conspicuous
roof
he
pounded
on
the
door
with
his
stick
until
it
burst
open
and
tramped
up
a
pair
of
steps
soon
they
came
into
a
large
hall
which
was
filled
with
tackled
and
little
ships
the
boy
understood
without
being
told
that
these
were
models
for
the
ships
which
had
been
built
for
the
swedish
navy
there
were
ships
of
many
different
varieties
there
were
old
whose
sides
bristled
with
cannon
and
which
had
high
structures
fore
and
aft
and
their
masts
weighed
down
with
a
network
of
sails
and
ropes
there
were
small
with
along
the
sides
there
were
undecked
cannon
sloops
and
richly
gilded
frigates
which
were
models
of
the
ones
the
kings
had
used
on
their
travels
finally
there
were
also
the
heavy
broad
ships
with
towers
and
cannon
on
deck
such
as
are
in
use
nowadays
and
narrow
shining
torpedo
boats
which
resembled
long
slender
fishes
when
the
boy
was
carried
around
among
all
this
he
was
awed
fancy
that
such
big
splendid
ships
have
been
built
here
in
sweden
he
thought
to
himself
he
had
plenty
of
time
to
see
all
that
was
to
be
seen
in
there
for
when
the
bronze
man
saw
the
models
he
forgot
everything
else
he
examined
them
all
from
the
first
to
the
last
and
asked
about
them
and
rosenbom
the
boatswain
on
the
told
as
much
as
he
knew
of
the
ships
builders
and
of
those
who
had
manned
them
and
of
the
fates
they
had
met
he
told
them
about
chapman
and
puke
and
trolle
of
hoagland
and
svensksund
all
the
way
along
until
after
that
he
had
not
been
there
both
he
and
the
bronze
man
had
the
most
to
say
about
the
fine
old
wooden
ships
the
new
battleships
they
did
exactly
appear
to
understand
i
can
hear
that
rosenbom
does
know
anything
about
these
things
said
the
bronze
man
therefore
let
us
go
and
look
at
something
else
for
this
amuses
me
rosenbom
by
this
time
he
had
entirely
given
up
his
search
for
the
boy
who
felt
calm
and
secure
where
he
sat
in
the
wooden
hat
thereupon
both
men
wandered
through
the
big
establishment
shops
anchor
smithy
machine
and
carpenter
shops
they
saw
the
mast
sheers
and
the
docks
the
large
magazines
the
arsenal
the
and
the
big
discarded
dock
which
had
been
blasted
in
the
rock
they
went
out
upon
the
where
the
naval
vessels
lay
moored
stepped
on
board
and
examined
them
like
two
old
wondered
disapproved
approved
and
became
indignant
the
boy
sat
in
safety
under
the
wooden
hat
and
heard
all
about
how
they
had
laboured
and
struggled
in
this
place
to
equip
the
navies
which
had
gone
out
from
here
he
heard
how
life
and
blood
had
been
risked
how
the
last
penny
had
been
sacrificed
to
build
the
warships
how
skilled
men
had
strained
all
their
powers
in
order
to
perfect
these
ships
which
had
been
their
fatherland
safeguard
a
couple
of
times
the
tears
came
to
the
boy
eyes
as
he
heard
all
this
and
the
very
last
they
went
into
an
open
court
where
the
galley
models
of
old
were
grouped
and
a
more
remarkable
sight
the
boy
had
never
beheld
for
these
models
had
inconceivably
powerful
and
faces
they
were
big
fearless
and
savage
filled
with
the
same
proud
spirit
that
had
fitted
out
the
great
ships
they
were
from
another
time
than
his
he
thought
that
he
shrivelled
up
before
them
but
when
they
came
in
here
the
bronze
man
said
to
the
wooden
man
take
off
thy
hat
rosenbom
for
those
that
stand
here
they
have
all
fought
for
the
fatherland
and
rosenbom
like
the
bronze
man
had
forgotten
why
they
had
begun
this
tramp
without
thinking
he
lifted
the
wooden
hat
from
his
head
and
shouted
i
take
off
my
hat
to
the
one
who
chose
the
harbour
and
founded
the
shipyard
and
recreated
the
navy
to
the
monarch
who
has
awakened
all
this
into
life
thanks
rosenbom
that
was
well
spoken
rosenbom
is
a
fine
man
but
what
is
this
rosenbom
for
there
stood
nils
holgersson
right
on
the
top
of
rosenbom
bald
pate
he
was
afraid
any
longer
but
raised
his
white
toboggan
hood
and
shouted
hurrah
for
you
longlip
the
bronze
man
struck
the
ground
hard
with
his
stick
but
the
boy
never
learned
what
he
had
intended
to
do
for
now
the
sun
ran
up
and
at
the
same
time
both
the
bronze
man
and
the
wooden
man
vanished
as
if
they
had
been
made
of
mists
while
he
still
stood
and
stared
after
them
the
wild
geese
flew
up
from
the
church
tower
and
swayed
back
and
forth
over
the
city
instantly
they
caught
sight
of
nils
holgersson
and
then
the
big
white
one
darted
down
from
the
sky
and
fetched
him
the
trip
to
öland
april
the
wild
geese
went
out
on
a
wooded
island
to
feed
there
they
happened
to
run
across
a
few
gray
geese
who
were
surprised
to
see
them
since
they
knew
very
well
that
their
kinsmen
the
wild
geese
usually
travel
over
the
interior
of
the
country
they
were
curious
and
inquisitive
and
would
be
satisfied
with
less
than
that
the
wild
geese
should
tell
them
all
about
the
persecution
which
they
had
to
endure
from
smirre
fox
when
they
had
finished
a
gray
goose
who
appeared
to
be
as
old
and
as
wise
as
akka
herself
said
it
was
a
great
misfortune
for
you
that
smirre
fox
was
declared
an
outlaw
in
his
own
land
he
be
sure
to
keep
his
word
and
follow
you
all
the
way
up
to
lapland
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
should
travel
north
over
småland
but
would
take
the
outside
route
over
öland
instead
so
that
he
be
thrown
off
the
track
entirely
to
really
mislead
him
you
must
remain
for
a
couple
of
days
on
öland
southern
point
there
you
find
lots
of
food
and
lots
of
company
i
do
believe
regret
it
if
you
go
over
there
it
was
certainly
very
sensible
advice
and
the
wild
geese
concluded
to
follow
it
as
soon
as
they
had
eaten
all
they
could
hold
they
started
on
the
trip
to
öland
none
of
them
had
ever
been
there
before
but
the
gray
goose
had
given
them
excellent
directions
they
only
had
to
travel
direct
south
until
they
came
to
a
large
which
extended
all
along
the
blekinge
coast
all
the
birds
who
had
winter
residences
by
the
west
sea
and
who
now
intended
to
travel
to
finland
and
russia
flew
forward
there
and
in
passing
they
were
always
in
the
habit
of
stopping
at
öland
to
rest
the
wild
geese
would
have
no
trouble
in
finding
guides
that
day
it
was
perfectly
still
and
warm
like
a
summer
day
the
best
weather
in
the
world
for
a
sea
trip
the
only
grave
thing
about
it
was
that
it
was
not
quite
clear
for
the
sky
was
gray
and
veiled
here
and
there
were
enormous
which
hung
way
down
to
the
sea
outer
edge
and
obstructed
the
view
when
the
travellers
had
gotten
away
from
the
wooded
island
the
sea
spread
itself
so
smooth
and
that
the
boy
as
he
looked
down
thought
the
water
had
disappeared
there
was
no
longer
any
earth
under
him
he
had
nothing
but
mist
and
sky
around
him
he
grew
very
dizzy
and
held
himself
tight
on
the
more
frightened
than
when
he
sat
there
for
the
first
time
it
seemed
as
though
he
could
possibly
hold
on
he
must
fall
in
some
direction
it
was
even
worse
when
they
reached
the
big
of
which
the
gray
goose
had
spoken
actually
there
came
flock
after
flock
flying
in
exactly
the
same
direction
they
seemed
to
follow
a
fixed
route
there
were
ducks
and
gray
geese
and
guillemots
loons
and
ducks
and
mergansers
and
grebes
and
and
but
now
when
the
boy
leaned
forward
and
looked
in
the
direction
where
the
sea
ought
to
lie
he
saw
the
whole
bird
procession
reflected
in
the
water
but
he
was
so
dizzy
that
he
did
understand
how
this
had
come
about
he
thought
that
the
whole
bird
procession
flew
with
their
bellies
upside
down
still
he
did
wonder
at
this
so
much
for
he
did
not
himself
know
which
was
up
and
which
was
down
the
birds
were
tired
out
and
impatient
to
get
on
none
of
them
shrieked
or
said
a
funny
thing
and
this
made
everything
seem
peculiarly
unreal
think
if
we
have
travelled
away
from
the
earth
he
said
to
himself
think
if
we
are
on
our
way
up
to
heaven
he
saw
nothing
but
mists
and
birds
around
him
and
began
to
look
upon
it
as
reasonable
that
they
were
travelling
he
was
glad
and
wondered
what
he
should
see
up
there
the
dizziness
passed
all
at
once
he
was
so
exceedingly
happy
at
the
thought
that
he
was
on
his
way
to
heaven
and
was
leaving
this
earth
just
about
then
he
heard
a
couple
of
loud
shots
and
saw
two
white
ascend
there
was
a
sudden
awakening
and
an
unrest
among
the
birds
hunters
hunters
they
cried
fly
high
fly
away
then
the
boy
saw
finally
that
they
were
travelling
all
the
while
over
the
and
that
they
certainly
were
not
in
heaven
in
a
long
row
lay
small
boats
filled
with
hunters
who
fired
shot
upon
shot
the
nearest
had
noticed
them
in
time
they
had
flown
too
low
several
dark
bodies
sank
down
toward
the
sea
and
for
every
one
that
fell
there
arose
cries
of
anguish
from
the
living
it
was
strange
for
one
who
had
but
lately
believed
himself
in
heaven
to
wake
up
suddenly
to
such
fear
and
lamentation
akka
shot
toward
the
heights
as
fast
as
she
could
and
the
flock
followed
with
the
greatest
possible
speed
the
wild
geese
got
safely
out
of
the
way
but
the
boy
could
get
over
his
amazement
to
think
that
anyone
could
wish
to
shoot
upon
such
as
akka
and
yksi
and
kaksi
and
the
and
the
others
human
beings
had
no
conception
of
what
they
did
so
it
bore
on
again
in
the
still
air
and
everything
was
as
quiet
as
heretofore
with
the
exception
that
some
of
the
tired
birds
called
out
every
now
and
then
are
we
not
there
soon
are
you
sure
we
on
the
right
track
hereupon
those
who
flew
in
the
centre
answered
we
are
flying
straight
to
öland
straight
to
öland
the
gray
geese
were
tired
out
and
the
loons
flew
around
them
do
be
in
such
a
rush
cried
the
ducks
you
eat
up
all
the
food
before
we
get
there
oh
there
be
enough
for
both
you
and
us
answered
the
loons
before
they
had
gotten
so
far
that
they
saw
öland
there
came
a
light
wind
against
them
it
brought
with
it
something
that
resembled
immense
clouds
of
white
smoke
just
as
if
there
was
a
big
fire
somewhere
when
the
birds
saw
the
first
white
spiral
haze
they
became
uneasy
and
increased
their
speed
but
that
which
resembled
smoke
blew
thicker
and
thicker
and
at
last
it
enveloped
them
altogether
they
smelled
no
smoke
and
the
smoke
was
not
dark
and
dry
but
white
and
damp
suddenly
the
boy
understood
that
it
was
nothing
but
a
mist
when
the
mist
became
so
thick
that
one
could
see
a
ahead
the
birds
began
to
carry
on
like
real
lunatics
all
these
who
before
had
travelled
forward
in
such
perfect
order
began
to
play
in
the
mist
they
flew
hither
and
thither
to
entice
one
another
astray
be
careful
they
cried
you
only
travelling
round
and
round
turn
back
for
pity
sake
you
never
get
to
öland
in
this
way
they
all
knew
perfectly
well
where
the
island
was
but
they
did
their
best
to
lead
each
other
astray
look
at
those
wagtails
rang
out
in
the
mist
they
are
going
back
toward
the
north
sea
have
a
care
wild
geese
shrieked
someone
from
another
direction
if
you
continue
like
this
you
get
clear
up
to
rügen
there
was
of
course
no
danger
that
the
birds
who
were
accustomed
to
travel
here
would
permit
themselves
to
be
lured
in
a
wrong
direction
but
the
ones
who
had
a
hard
time
of
it
were
the
wild
geese
the
jesters
observed
that
they
were
uncertain
as
to
the
way
and
did
all
they
could
to
confuse
them
where
do
you
intend
to
go
good
people
called
a
swan
he
came
right
up
to
akka
and
looked
sympathetic
and
serious
we
shall
travel
to
öland
but
we
have
never
been
there
before
said
akka
she
thought
that
this
was
a
bird
to
be
trusted
it
too
bad
said
the
swan
they
have
lured
you
in
the
wrong
direction
you
on
the
road
to
blekinge
now
come
with
me
and
put
you
right
and
so
he
flew
off
with
them
and
when
he
had
taken
them
so
far
away
from
the
track
that
they
heard
no
calls
he
disappeared
in
the
mist
they
flew
around
for
a
while
at
random
they
had
barely
succeeded
in
finding
the
birds
again
when
a
duck
approached
them
it
best
that
you
lie
down
on
the
water
until
the
mist
clears
said
the
duck
it
is
evident
that
you
are
not
accustomed
to
look
out
for
yourselves
on
journeys
those
rogues
succeeded
in
making
akka
head
swim
as
near
as
the
boy
could
make
out
the
wild
geese
flew
round
and
round
for
a
long
time
be
careful
ca
you
see
that
you
are
flying
up
and
down
shouted
a
loon
as
he
rushed
by
the
boy
positively
clutched
the
around
the
neck
this
was
something
which
he
had
feared
for
a
long
time
no
one
can
tell
when
they
would
have
arrived
if
they
had
heard
a
rolling
and
muffled
sound
in
the
distance
then
akka
craned
her
neck
snapped
hard
with
her
wings
and
rushed
on
at
full
speed
now
she
had
something
to
go
by
the
gray
goose
had
told
her
not
to
light
on
öland
southern
point
because
there
was
a
cannon
there
which
the
people
used
to
shoot
the
mist
with
now
she
knew
the
way
and
now
no
one
in
the
world
should
lead
her
astray
again
öland
southern
point
third
to
on
the
most
southerly
part
of
öland
lies
a
royal
demesne
which
is
called
ottenby
it
is
a
rather
large
estate
which
extends
from
shore
to
shore
straight
across
the
island
and
it
is
remarkable
because
it
has
always
been
a
haunt
for
large
in
the
seventeenth
century
when
the
kings
used
to
go
over
to
öland
to
hunt
the
entire
estate
was
nothing
but
a
deer
park
in
the
eighteenth
century
there
was
a
stud
there
where
blooded
were
bred
and
a
sheep
farm
where
several
hundred
sheep
were
maintained
in
our
days
you
find
neither
blooded
horses
nor
sheep
at
ottenby
in
place
of
them
live
great
herds
of
young
horses
which
are
to
be
used
by
the
cavalry
in
all
the
land
there
is
certainly
no
place
that
could
be
a
better
abode
for
animals
along
the
extreme
eastern
shore
lies
the
old
sheep
meadow
which
is
a
mile
and
a
half
long
and
the
largest
meadow
in
all
öland
where
animals
can
graze
and
play
and
run
about
as
free
as
if
they
were
in
a
wilderness
and
there
you
will
find
the
celebrated
ottenby
grove
with
the
oaks
which
give
shade
from
the
sun
and
shelter
from
the
severe
öland
winds
and
we
must
not
forget
the
long
ottenby
wall
which
stretches
from
shore
to
shore
and
separates
ottenby
from
the
rest
of
the
island
so
that
the
animals
may
know
how
far
the
old
royal
demesne
extends
and
be
careful
about
getting
in
on
other
ground
where
they
are
not
so
well
protected
you
find
plenty
of
tame
animals
at
ottenby
but
that
is
all
one
could
almost
believe
that
the
wild
ones
also
felt
that
on
an
old
crown
property
both
the
wild
and
the
tame
ones
can
count
upon
shelter
and
protection
since
they
venture
there
in
such
great
numbers
besides
there
are
still
a
few
stags
of
the
old
descent
left
and
and
partridges
love
to
live
there
and
it
offers
a
resting
place
in
the
spring
and
late
summer
for
thousands
of
migratory
birds
above
all
it
is
the
swampy
eastern
shore
below
the
sheep
meadow
where
the
migratory
birds
alight
to
rest
and
feed
when
the
wild
geese
and
nils
holgersson
had
finally
found
their
way
to
öland
they
came
down
like
all
the
rest
on
the
shore
near
the
sheep
meadow
the
mist
lay
thick
over
the
island
just
as
it
had
over
the
sea
but
still
the
boy
was
amazed
at
all
the
birds
which
he
discerned
only
on
the
little
narrow
stretch
of
shore
which
he
could
see
it
was
a
low
with
stones
and
pools
and
a
lot
of
if
the
boy
had
been
permitted
to
choose
it
is
likely
that
he
would
have
thought
of
alighting
there
but
the
birds
probably
looked
upon
this
as
a
veritable
paradise
ducks
and
geese
walked
about
and
fed
on
the
meadow
nearer
the
water
ran
snipe
and
other
the
loons
lay
in
the
sea
and
fished
but
the
life
and
movement
was
upon
the
long
banks
along
the
coast
there
the
birds
stood
side
by
side
close
together
and
picked
which
must
have
been
found
there
in
limitless
quantities
for
it
was
very
evident
that
there
was
never
any
complaint
over
a
lack
of
food
the
great
majority
were
going
to
travel
farther
and
had
only
alighted
to
take
a
short
rest
and
as
soon
as
the
leader
of
a
flock
thought
that
his
comrades
had
recovered
themselves
sufficiently
he
said
if
you
are
ready
now
we
may
as
well
move
on
no
wait
wait
we
have
had
anything
like
enough
said
the
followers
you
surely
do
believe
that
i
intend
to
let
you
eat
so
much
that
you
will
not
be
able
to
move
said
the
leader
and
flapped
his
wings
and
started
off
along
the
outermost
banks
lay
a
flock
of
swans
they
did
bother
about
going
on
land
but
rested
themselves
by
lying
and
rocking
on
the
water
now
and
then
they
dived
down
with
their
necks
and
brought
up
food
from
the
when
they
had
gotten
hold
of
anything
very
good
they
indulged
in
loud
shouts
that
sounded
like
trumpet
calls
when
the
boy
heard
that
there
were
swans
on
the
shoals
he
hurried
out
to
the
banks
he
had
never
before
seen
wild
swans
at
close
range
he
had
luck
on
his
side
so
that
he
got
close
up
to
them
the
boy
was
not
the
only
one
who
had
heard
the
swans
both
the
wild
geese
and
the
gray
geese
and
the
loons
swam
out
between
the
banks
laid
themselves
in
a
ring
around
the
swans
and
stared
at
them
the
swans
ruffled
their
feathers
raised
their
wings
like
sails
and
lifted
their
necks
high
in
the
air
occasionally
one
and
another
of
them
swam
up
to
a
goose
or
a
great
loon
or
a
and
said
a
few
words
and
then
it
appeared
as
though
the
one
addressed
hardly
dared
raise
his
bill
to
reply
but
then
there
was
a
little
loon
a
tiny
mischievous
baggage
who
could
stand
all
this
ceremony
he
dived
suddenly
and
disappeared
under
the
water
edge
soon
after
that
one
of
the
swans
let
out
a
scream
and
swam
off
so
quickly
that
the
water
foamed
then
he
stopped
and
began
to
look
majestic
once
more
but
soon
another
one
shrieked
in
the
same
way
as
the
first
one
and
then
a
third
the
little
loon
was
able
to
stay
under
water
any
longer
but
appeared
on
the
water
edge
little
and
black
and
venomous
the
swans
rushed
toward
him
but
when
they
saw
what
a
poor
little
thing
it
was
they
turned
abruptly
as
if
they
considered
themselves
too
good
to
quarrel
with
him
then
the
little
loon
dived
again
and
pinched
their
feet
it
certainly
must
have
hurt
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
they
could
not
maintain
their
dignity
at
once
they
took
a
decided
stand
they
began
to
beat
the
air
with
their
wings
so
that
it
thundered
came
forward
a
bit
as
though
they
were
running
on
the
water
got
wind
under
their
wings
and
raised
themselves
when
the
swans
were
gone
they
were
greatly
missed
and
those
who
had
lately
been
amused
by
the
little
loon
antics
scolded
him
for
his
thoughtlessness
the
boy
walked
toward
land
again
there
he
stationed
himself
to
see
how
the
played
they
resembled
small
storks
like
these
they
had
little
bodies
long
legs
and
necks
and
light
swaying
movements
only
they
were
not
gray
but
brown
they
stood
in
a
long
row
on
the
shore
where
it
was
washed
by
waves
as
soon
as
a
wave
rolled
in
the
whole
row
ran
backward
as
soon
as
it
receded
they
followed
it
and
they
kept
this
up
for
hours
the
showiest
of
all
the
birds
were
the
they
were
undoubtedly
related
to
the
ordinary
ducks
for
like
these
they
too
had
a
body
broad
bill
and
webbed
feet
but
they
were
much
more
elaborately
gotten
up
the
feather
dress
itself
was
white
around
their
necks
they
wore
a
broad
gold
band
the
shone
in
green
red
and
black
and
the
were
black
and
the
head
was
dark
green
and
shimmered
like
satin
as
soon
as
any
of
these
appeared
on
the
shore
the
others
said
now
just
look
at
those
things
they
know
how
to
tog
themselves
out
if
they
were
not
so
conspicuous
they
would
have
to
dig
their
nests
in
the
earth
but
could
lay
above
ground
like
anyone
else
said
a
brown
they
may
try
as
much
as
they
please
still
they
never
get
anywhere
with
such
noses
said
a
gray
goose
and
this
was
actually
true
the
had
a
big
knob
on
the
base
of
the
bill
which
spoiled
their
appearance
close
to
the
shore
and
moved
forward
on
the
water
and
fished
what
kind
of
fish
are
you
catching
asked
a
wild
goose
it
a
stickleback
it
öland
stickleback
it
the
best
stickleback
in
the
world
said
a
gull
wo
you
taste
of
it
and
he
flew
up
to
the
goose
with
his
mouth
full
of
the
little
fishes
and
wanted
to
give
her
some
ugh
do
you
think
that
i
eat
such
filth
said
the
wild
goose
the
next
morning
it
was
just
as
cloudy
the
wild
geese
walked
about
on
the
meadow
and
fed
but
the
boy
had
gone
to
the
seashore
to
gather
mussels
there
were
plenty
of
them
and
when
he
thought
that
the
next
day
perhaps
they
would
be
in
some
place
where
they
could
get
any
food
at
all
he
concluded
that
he
would
try
to
make
himself
a
little
bag
which
he
could
fill
with
mussels
he
found
an
old
sedge
on
the
meadow
which
was
strong
and
tough
and
out
of
this
he
began
to
braid
a
knapsack
he
worked
at
this
for
several
hours
but
he
was
well
satisfied
with
it
when
it
was
finished
at
dinner
time
all
the
wild
geese
came
running
and
asked
him
if
he
had
seen
anything
of
the
white
no
he
has
not
been
with
me
said
the
boy
we
had
him
with
us
all
along
until
just
lately
said
akka
but
now
we
no
longer
know
where
he
to
be
found
the
boy
jumped
up
and
was
terribly
frightened
he
asked
if
any
fox
or
eagle
had
put
in
an
appearance
or
if
any
human
being
had
been
seen
in
the
neighbourhood
but
no
one
had
noticed
anything
dangerous
the
had
probably
lost
his
way
in
the
mist
but
it
was
just
as
great
a
misfortune
for
the
boy
in
whatever
way
the
white
one
had
been
lost
and
he
started
off
immediately
to
hunt
for
him
the
mist
shielded
him
so
that
he
could
run
wherever
he
wished
without
being
seen
but
it
also
prevented
him
from
seeing
he
ran
southward
along
the
shore
all
the
way
down
to
the
lighthouse
and
the
mist
cannon
on
the
island
extreme
point
it
was
the
same
bird
confusion
everywhere
but
no
he
ventured
over
to
ottenby
estate
and
he
searched
every
one
of
the
old
hollow
oaks
in
ottenby
grove
but
he
saw
no
trace
of
the
he
searched
until
it
began
to
grow
dark
then
he
had
to
turn
back
again
to
the
eastern
shore
he
walked
with
heavy
steps
and
was
fearfully
blue
he
did
know
what
would
become
of
him
if
he
could
find
the
there
was
no
one
whom
he
could
spare
less
but
when
he
wandered
over
the
sheep
meadow
what
was
that
big
white
thing
that
came
toward
him
in
the
mist
if
it
was
the
he
was
all
right
and
very
glad
that
at
last
he
had
been
able
to
find
his
way
back
to
the
others
the
mist
had
made
him
so
dizzy
he
said
that
he
had
wandered
around
on
the
big
meadow
all
day
long
the
boy
threw
his
arms
around
his
neck
for
very
joy
and
begged
him
to
take
care
of
himself
and
not
wander
away
from
the
others
and
he
promised
positively
that
he
never
would
do
this
again
no
never
again
but
the
next
morning
when
the
boy
went
down
to
the
beach
and
hunted
for
mussels
the
geese
came
running
and
asked
if
he
had
seen
the
no
of
course
he
had
well
then
the
was
lost
again
he
had
gone
astray
in
the
mist
just
as
he
had
done
the
day
before
the
boy
ran
off
in
great
terror
and
began
to
search
he
found
one
place
where
the
ottenby
wall
was
so
that
he
could
climb
over
it
later
he
went
about
first
on
the
shore
which
gradually
widened
and
became
so
large
that
there
was
room
for
fields
and
meadows
and
farms
then
up
on
the
flat
highland
which
lay
in
the
middle
of
the
island
and
where
there
were
no
buildings
except
windmills
and
where
the
turf
was
so
thin
that
the
white
cement
shone
under
it
meanwhile
he
could
not
find
the
and
as
it
drew
on
toward
evening
and
the
boy
must
return
to
the
beach
he
could
believe
anything
but
that
his
travelling
companion
was
lost
he
was
so
depressed
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
himself
he
had
just
climbed
over
the
wall
again
when
he
heard
a
stone
crash
down
close
beside
him
as
he
turned
to
see
what
it
was
he
thought
that
he
could
distinguish
something
that
moved
on
a
stone
pile
which
lay
close
to
the
wall
he
stole
nearer
and
saw
the
come
trudging
wearily
over
the
stone
pile
with
several
long
fibres
in
his
mouth
the
did
see
the
boy
and
the
boy
did
not
call
to
him
but
thought
it
advisable
to
find
out
first
why
the
time
and
again
disappeared
in
this
manner
and
he
soon
learned
the
reason
for
it
up
in
the
stone
pile
lay
a
young
gray
goose
who
cried
with
joy
when
the
came
the
boy
crept
near
so
that
he
heard
what
they
said
then
he
found
out
that
the
gray
goose
had
been
wounded
in
one
wing
so
that
she
could
not
fly
and
that
her
flock
had
travelled
away
from
her
and
left
her
alone
she
had
been
near
death
door
with
hunger
when
the
white
had
heard
her
call
the
other
day
and
had
sought
her
out
ever
since
he
had
been
carrying
food
to
her
they
had
both
hoped
that
she
would
be
well
before
they
left
the
island
but
as
yet
she
could
neither
fly
nor
walk
she
was
very
much
worried
over
this
but
he
comforted
her
with
the
thought
that
he
should
travel
for
a
long
time
at
last
he
bade
her
and
promised
to
come
the
next
day
the
boy
let
the
go
and
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
he
stole
in
turn
up
to
the
stone
heap
he
was
angry
because
he
had
been
deceived
and
now
he
wanted
to
say
to
that
gray
goose
that
the
was
his
property
he
was
going
to
take
the
boy
up
to
lapland
and
there
would
be
no
talk
of
his
staying
here
on
her
account
but
now
when
he
saw
the
young
gray
goose
close
to
he
understood
not
only
why
the
had
gone
and
carried
food
to
her
for
two
days
but
also
why
he
had
not
wished
to
mention
that
he
had
helped
her
she
had
the
prettiest
little
head
her
was
like
soft
satin
and
the
eyes
were
mild
and
pleading
when
she
saw
the
boy
she
wanted
to
run
away
but
the
left
wing
was
out
of
joint
and
dragged
on
the
ground
so
that
it
interfered
with
her
movements
you
must
be
afraid
of
me
said
the
boy
and
did
look
nearly
so
angry
as
he
had
intended
to
appear
i
thumbietot
morten
comrade
he
continued
then
he
stood
there
and
know
what
he
wanted
to
say
occasionally
one
finds
something
among
animals
which
makes
one
wonder
what
sort
of
creatures
they
really
are
one
is
almost
afraid
that
they
may
be
transformed
human
beings
it
was
something
like
this
with
the
gray
goose
as
soon
as
thumbietot
said
who
he
was
she
lowered
her
neck
and
head
very
charmingly
before
him
and
said
in
a
voice
that
was
so
pretty
that
he
could
believe
it
was
a
goose
who
spoke
i
am
very
glad
that
you
have
come
here
to
help
me
the
white
has
told
me
that
no
one
is
as
wise
and
as
good
as
you
she
said
this
with
such
dignity
that
the
boy
grew
really
embarrassed
this
surely
ca
be
any
bird
thought
he
it
is
certainly
some
bewitched
princess
he
was
filled
with
a
desire
to
help
her
and
ran
his
hand
under
the
feathers
and
felt
along
the
the
bone
was
not
broken
but
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
joint
he
got
his
finger
down
into
the
empty
cavity
be
careful
now
he
said
and
got
a
firm
grip
on
the
and
fitted
it
into
the
place
where
it
ought
to
be
he
did
it
very
quickly
and
well
considering
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
attempted
anything
of
the
sort
but
it
must
have
hurt
very
much
for
the
poor
young
goose
uttered
a
single
shrill
cry
and
then
sank
down
among
the
stones
without
showing
a
sign
of
life
the
boy
was
terribly
frightened
he
had
only
wished
to
help
her
and
now
she
was
dead
he
made
a
big
jump
from
the
stone
pile
and
ran
away
he
thought
it
was
as
though
he
had
murdered
a
human
being
the
next
morning
it
was
clear
and
free
from
mist
and
akka
said
that
now
they
should
continue
their
travels
all
the
others
were
willing
to
go
but
the
white
made
excuses
the
boy
understood
well
enough
that
he
did
care
to
leave
the
gray
goose
akka
did
not
listen
to
him
but
started
off
the
boy
jumped
up
on
the
back
and
the
white
one
followed
the
flock
albeit
slowly
and
unwillingly
the
boy
was
mighty
glad
that
they
could
fly
away
from
the
island
he
was
on
account
of
the
gray
goose
and
had
not
cared
to
tell
the
how
it
had
turned
out
when
he
had
tried
to
cure
her
it
would
probably
be
best
if
morten
never
found
out
about
this
he
thought
though
he
wondered
at
the
same
time
how
the
white
one
had
the
heart
to
leave
the
gray
goose
but
suddenly
the
turned
the
thought
of
the
young
gray
goose
had
overpowered
him
it
could
go
as
it
would
with
the
lapland
trip
he
could
go
with
the
others
when
he
knew
that
she
lay
alone
and
ill
and
would
starve
to
death
with
a
few
he
was
over
the
stone
pile
but
then
there
lay
no
young
gray
goose
between
the
stones
dunfin
dunfin
where
art
thou
called
the
the
fox
has
probably
been
here
and
taken
her
thought
the
boy
but
at
that
moment
he
heard
a
pretty
voice
answer
the
here
am
i
here
am
i
i
have
only
been
taking
a
morning
bath
and
up
from
the
water
came
the
little
gray
goose
fresh
and
in
good
trim
and
told
how
thumbietot
had
pulled
her
wing
into
place
and
that
she
was
entirely
well
and
ready
to
follow
them
on
the
journey
the
drops
of
water
lay
like
on
her
shimmery
feathers
and
thumbietot
thought
once
again
that
she
was
a
real
little
princess
the
big
butterfly
april
the
geese
travelled
alongside
the
coast
of
the
long
island
which
lay
distinctly
visible
under
them
the
boy
felt
happy
and
light
of
heart
during
the
trip
he
was
just
as
pleased
and
well
satisfied
as
he
had
been
glum
and
depressed
the
day
before
when
he
roamed
around
down
on
the
island
and
hunted
for
the
he
saw
now
that
the
interior
of
the
island
consisted
of
a
barren
high
plain
with
a
wreath
of
fertile
land
along
the
coast
and
he
began
to
comprehend
the
meaning
of
something
which
he
had
heard
the
other
evening
he
had
just
seated
himself
to
rest
a
bit
by
one
of
the
many
windmills
on
the
highland
when
a
couple
of
shepherds
came
along
with
the
dogs
beside
them
and
a
large
herd
of
sheep
in
their
train
the
boy
had
not
been
afraid
because
he
was
well
concealed
under
the
windmill
stairs
but
as
it
turned
out
the
shepherds
came
and
seated
themselves
on
the
same
stairway
and
then
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
but
to
keep
perfectly
still
one
of
the
shepherds
was
young
and
looked
about
as
folks
do
mostly
the
other
was
an
old
queer
one
his
body
was
large
and
knotty
but
the
head
was
small
and
the
face
had
sensitive
and
delicate
features
it
appeared
as
though
the
body
and
head
did
want
to
fit
together
at
all
one
moment
he
sat
silent
and
gazed
into
the
mist
with
an
unutterably
weary
expression
then
he
began
to
talk
to
his
companion
then
the
other
one
took
out
some
bread
and
cheese
from
his
knapsack
to
eat
his
evening
meal
he
answered
scarcely
anything
but
listened
very
patiently
just
as
if
he
were
thinking
i
might
as
well
give
you
the
pleasure
of
letting
you
chatter
a
while
now
i
shall
tell
you
something
eric
said
the
old
shepherd
i
have
figured
out
that
in
former
days
when
both
human
beings
and
animals
were
much
larger
than
they
are
now
that
the
butterflies
too
must
have
been
uncommonly
large
and
once
there
was
a
butterfly
that
was
many
miles
long
and
had
wings
as
wide
as
seas
those
wings
were
blue
and
shone
like
silver
and
so
gorgeous
that
when
the
butterfly
was
out
flying
all
the
other
animals
stood
still
and
stared
at
it
it
had
this
drawback
however
that
it
was
too
large
the
wings
had
hard
work
to
carry
it
but
probably
all
would
have
gone
very
well
if
the
butterfly
had
been
wise
enough
to
remain
on
the
hillside
but
it
was
it
ventured
out
over
the
east
sea
and
it
had
gotten
very
far
before
the
storm
came
along
and
began
to
tear
at
its
wings
well
it
easy
to
understand
eric
how
things
would
go
when
the
east
sea
storm
commenced
to
wrestle
with
frail
it
was
long
before
they
were
torn
away
and
scattered
and
then
of
course
the
poor
butterfly
fell
into
the
sea
at
first
it
was
tossed
backward
and
forward
on
the
billows
and
then
it
was
stranded
upon
a
few
outside
of
småland
and
there
it
lay
as
large
and
long
as
it
was
now
i
think
eric
that
if
the
butterfly
had
dropped
on
land
it
would
soon
have
rotted
and
fallen
apart
but
since
it
fell
into
the
sea
it
was
soaked
through
and
through
with
lime
and
became
as
hard
as
a
stone
you
know
of
course
that
we
have
found
stones
on
the
shore
which
were
nothing
but
petrified
worms
now
i
believe
that
it
went
the
same
way
with
the
big
i
believe
that
it
turned
where
it
lay
into
a
long
narrow
mountain
out
in
the
east
sea
do
you
he
paused
for
a
reply
and
the
other
one
nodded
to
him
go
on
so
i
may
hear
what
you
are
driving
at
said
he
and
mark
you
eric
that
this
very
öland
upon
which
you
and
i
live
is
nothing
else
than
the
old
if
one
only
thinks
about
it
one
can
observe
that
the
island
is
a
butterfly
toward
the
north
the
slender
and
the
round
head
can
be
seen
and
toward
the
south
one
sees
the
which
first
broadens
out
and
then
narrows
to
a
sharp
point
here
he
paused
once
more
and
looked
at
his
companion
rather
anxiously
to
see
how
he
would
take
this
assertion
but
the
young
man
kept
on
eating
with
the
utmost
calm
and
nodded
to
him
to
continue
as
soon
as
the
butterfly
had
been
changed
into
a
limestone
rock
many
different
kinds
of
seeds
of
herbs
and
trees
came
travelling
with
the
winds
and
wanted
to
take
root
on
it
it
was
a
long
time
before
anything
but
sedge
could
grow
there
then
came
sheep
sorrel
and
the
and
but
even
there
is
not
so
much
growth
on
alvaret
that
the
mountain
is
well
covered
but
it
shines
through
here
and
there
and
no
one
can
think
of
ploughing
and
sowing
up
here
where
the
is
so
thin
but
if
you
will
admit
that
alvaret
and
the
strongholds
around
it
are
made
of
the
then
you
may
well
have
the
right
to
question
where
that
land
which
lies
beneath
the
strongholds
came
from
yes
it
is
just
that
said
he
who
was
eating
that
i
should
indeed
like
to
know
well
you
must
remember
that
öland
has
lain
in
the
sea
for
a
good
many
years
and
in
the
course
of
time
all
the
things
which
tumble
around
with
the
waves
and
sand
and
clams
have
gathered
around
it
and
remained
lying
there
and
then
stone
and
gravel
have
fallen
down
from
both
the
eastern
and
western
strongholds
in
this
way
the
island
has
acquired
broad
shores
where
grain
and
flowers
and
trees
can
grow
up
here
on
the
hard
only
sheep
and
cows
and
little
horses
go
about
only
lapwings
and
plover
live
here
and
there
are
no
buildings
except
windmills
and
a
few
stone
huts
where
we
shepherds
crawl
in
but
down
on
the
coast
lie
big
villages
and
churches
and
parishes
and
fishing
hamlets
and
a
whole
city
he
looked
questioningly
at
the
other
one
this
one
had
finished
his
meal
and
was
tying
the
together
i
wonder
where
you
will
end
with
all
this
said
he
it
is
only
this
that
i
want
to
know
said
the
shepherd
as
he
lowered
his
voice
so
that
he
almost
whispered
the
words
and
looked
into
the
mist
with
his
small
eyes
which
appeared
to
be
worn
out
from
spying
after
all
that
which
does
not
exist
only
this
i
want
to
know
if
the
peasants
who
live
on
the
farms
beneath
the
strongholds
or
the
fishermen
who
take
the
small
herring
from
the
sea
or
the
merchants
in
borgholm
or
the
bathing
guests
who
come
here
every
summer
or
the
tourists
who
wander
around
in
borgholm
old
castle
ruin
or
the
sportsmen
who
come
here
in
the
fall
to
hunt
partridges
or
the
painters
who
sit
here
on
alvaret
and
paint
the
sheep
and
windmills
i
should
like
to
know
if
any
of
them
understand
that
this
island
has
been
a
butterfly
which
flew
about
with
great
shimmery
wings
ah
said
the
young
shepherd
suddenly
it
should
have
occurred
to
some
of
them
as
they
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
stronghold
of
an
evening
and
heard
the
nightingales
trill
in
the
groves
below
them
and
looked
over
kalmar
sound
that
this
island
could
not
have
come
into
existence
in
the
same
way
as
the
others
i
want
to
ask
said
the
old
one
if
no
one
has
had
the
desire
to
give
wings
to
the
windmills
so
large
that
they
could
reach
to
heaven
so
large
that
they
could
lift
the
whole
island
out
of
the
sea
and
let
it
fly
like
a
butterfly
among
butterflies
it
may
be
possible
that
there
is
something
in
what
you
say
said
the
young
one
for
on
summer
nights
when
the
heavens
widen
and
open
over
the
island
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
it
was
as
if
it
wanted
to
raise
itself
from
the
sea
and
fly
away
but
when
the
old
one
had
finally
gotten
the
young
one
to
talk
he
listen
to
him
very
much
i
would
like
to
know
the
old
one
said
in
a
low
tone
if
anyone
can
explain
why
one
feels
such
a
longing
up
here
on
alvaret
i
have
felt
it
every
day
of
my
life
and
i
think
it
preys
upon
each
and
every
one
who
must
go
about
here
i
want
to
know
if
no
one
else
has
understood
that
all
this
wistfulness
is
caused
by
the
fact
that
the
whole
island
is
a
butterfly
that
longs
for
its
wings
little
karl
island
the
storm
april
the
wild
geese
had
spent
the
night
on
öland
northern
point
and
were
now
on
their
way
to
the
continent
a
strong
south
wind
blew
over
kalmar
sound
and
they
had
been
thrown
northward
still
they
worked
their
way
toward
land
with
good
speed
but
when
they
were
nearing
the
first
islands
a
powerful
rumbling
was
heard
as
if
a
lot
of
birds
had
come
flying
and
the
water
under
them
all
at
once
became
perfectly
black
akka
drew
in
her
wings
so
suddenly
that
she
almost
stood
still
in
the
air
thereupon
she
lowered
herself
to
light
on
the
edge
of
the
sea
but
before
the
geese
had
reached
the
water
the
west
storm
caught
up
with
them
already
it
drove
before
it
fogs
salt
scum
and
small
birds
it
also
snatched
with
it
the
wild
geese
threw
them
on
end
and
cast
them
toward
the
sea
it
was
a
rough
storm
the
wild
geese
tried
to
turn
back
time
and
again
but
they
could
do
it
and
were
driven
out
toward
the
east
sea
the
storm
had
already
blown
them
past
öland
and
the
sea
lay
before
them
empty
and
desolate
there
was
nothing
for
them
to
do
but
to
keep
out
of
the
water
when
akka
observed
that
they
were
unable
to
turn
back
she
thought
that
it
was
needless
to
let
the
storm
drive
them
over
the
entire
east
sea
therefore
she
sank
down
to
the
water
now
the
sea
was
raging
and
increased
in
violence
with
every
second
the
billows
rolled
forward
with
seething
foam
on
their
crests
each
one
surged
higher
than
the
other
it
was
as
though
they
raced
with
each
other
to
see
which
could
foam
the
wildest
but
the
wild
geese
were
not
afraid
of
the
swells
on
the
contrary
this
seemed
to
afford
them
much
pleasure
they
did
not
strain
themselves
with
swimming
but
lay
and
let
themselves
be
washed
up
with
the
and
down
in
the
and
had
just
as
much
fun
as
children
in
a
swing
their
only
anxiety
was
that
the
flock
should
be
separated
the
few
who
drove
by
up
in
the
storm
cried
with
envy
there
is
no
danger
for
you
who
can
swim
but
the
wild
geese
were
certainly
not
out
of
all
danger
in
the
first
place
the
rocking
made
them
helplessly
sleepy
they
wished
continually
to
turn
their
heads
backward
poke
their
bills
under
their
wings
and
go
to
sleep
nothing
can
be
more
dangerous
than
to
fall
asleep
in
this
way
and
akka
called
out
all
the
while
do
go
to
sleep
wild
geese
he
that
falls
asleep
will
get
away
from
the
flock
he
that
gets
away
from
the
flock
is
lost
despite
all
attempts
at
resistance
one
after
another
fell
asleep
and
akka
herself
came
pretty
near
dozing
off
when
she
suddenly
saw
something
round
and
dark
rise
on
the
top
of
a
wave
seals
seals
seals
cried
akka
in
a
high
shrill
voice
and
raised
herself
up
in
the
air
with
resounding
it
was
just
at
the
crucial
moment
before
the
last
wild
goose
had
time
to
come
up
from
the
water
the
seals
were
so
close
to
her
that
they
made
a
grab
for
her
feet
then
the
wild
geese
were
once
more
up
in
the
storm
which
drove
them
before
it
out
to
sea
no
rest
did
it
allow
either
itself
or
the
wild
geese
and
no
land
did
they
see
only
desolate
sea
they
lit
on
the
water
again
as
soon
as
they
dared
venture
but
when
they
had
rocked
upon
the
waves
for
a
while
they
became
sleepy
again
and
when
they
fell
asleep
the
seals
came
swimming
if
old
akka
had
not
been
so
wakeful
not
one
of
them
would
have
escaped
all
day
the
storm
raged
and
it
caused
fearful
havoc
among
the
crowds
of
little
birds
which
at
this
time
of
year
were
migrating
some
were
driven
from
their
course
to
foreign
lands
where
they
died
of
starvation
others
became
so
exhausted
that
they
sank
down
in
the
sea
and
were
drowned
many
were
crushed
against
the
and
many
became
a
prey
for
the
seals
the
storm
continued
all
day
and
at
last
akka
began
to
wonder
if
she
and
her
flock
would
perish
they
were
now
dead
tired
and
nowhere
did
they
see
any
place
where
they
might
rest
toward
evening
she
no
longer
dared
to
lie
down
on
the
sea
because
now
it
filled
up
all
of
a
sudden
with
large
which
struck
against
each
other
and
she
feared
they
should
be
crushed
between
these
a
couple
of
times
the
wild
geese
tried
to
stand
on
the
but
one
time
the
wild
storm
swept
them
into
the
water
another
time
the
merciless
seals
came
creeping
up
on
the
ice
at
sundown
the
wild
geese
were
once
more
up
in
the
air
they
flew
on
fearful
for
the
night
the
darkness
seemed
to
come
upon
them
much
too
quickly
this
night
which
was
so
full
of
dangers
it
was
terrible
that
they
as
yet
saw
no
land
how
would
it
go
with
them
if
they
were
forced
to
stay
out
on
the
sea
all
night
they
would
either
be
crushed
between
the
or
devoured
by
seals
or
separated
by
the
storm
the
heavens
were
the
moon
hid
itself
and
the
darkness
came
quickly
at
the
same
time
all
nature
was
filled
with
a
horror
which
caused
the
most
courageous
hearts
to
quail
distressed
cries
had
sounded
over
the
sea
all
day
long
without
anyone
having
paid
the
slightest
attention
to
them
but
now
when
one
no
longer
saw
who
it
was
that
uttered
them
they
seemed
mournful
and
terrifying
down
on
the
sea
the
crashed
against
each
other
with
a
loud
rumbling
noise
the
seals
tuned
up
their
wild
hunting
songs
it
was
as
though
heaven
and
earth
were
about
to
clash
the
sheep
the
boy
sat
for
a
moment
and
looked
down
into
the
sea
suddenly
he
thought
that
it
began
to
roar
louder
than
ever
he
looked
up
right
in
front
of
him
only
a
couple
of
metres
away
stood
a
rugged
and
bare
at
its
base
the
waves
dashed
into
a
foaming
spray
the
wild
geese
flew
straight
toward
the
cliff
and
the
boy
did
not
see
how
they
could
avoid
being
dashed
to
pieces
against
it
hardly
had
he
wondered
that
akka
had
seen
the
danger
in
time
when
they
were
over
by
the
mountain
then
he
also
noticed
that
in
front
of
them
was
the
entrance
to
a
grotto
into
this
the
geese
steered
and
the
next
moment
they
were
safe
the
first
thing
the
wild
geese
thought
of
before
they
gave
themselves
time
to
rejoice
over
their
safety
was
to
see
if
all
their
comrades
were
also
harboured
yes
there
were
akka
iksi
kolmi
nelja
viisi
knusi
all
the
six
goslings
the
dunfin
and
thumbietot
but
kaksi
from
nuolja
the
first
goose
was
missing
and
no
one
knew
anything
about
her
fate
when
the
wild
geese
discovered
that
no
one
but
kaksi
had
been
separated
from
the
flock
they
took
the
matter
lightly
kaksi
was
old
and
wise
she
knew
all
their
byways
and
their
habits
and
she
of
course
would
know
how
to
find
her
way
back
to
them
then
the
wild
geese
began
to
look
around
in
the
cave
enough
daylight
came
in
through
the
opening
so
that
they
could
see
the
grotto
was
both
deep
and
wide
they
were
delighted
to
think
they
had
found
such
a
fine
night
harbour
when
one
of
them
caught
sight
of
some
shining
green
dots
which
glittered
in
a
dark
corner
these
are
eyes
cried
akka
there
are
big
animals
in
here
they
rushed
toward
the
opening
but
thumbietot
called
to
them
there
is
nothing
to
run
away
from
it
only
a
few
sheep
who
are
lying
alongside
the
grotto
wall
when
the
wild
geese
had
accustomed
themselves
to
the
dim
daylight
in
the
grotto
they
saw
the
sheep
very
distinctly
the
ones
might
be
about
as
many
as
there
were
geese
but
beside
these
there
were
a
few
little
lambs
an
old
ram
with
long
twisted
horns
appeared
to
be
the
most
lordly
one
of
the
flock
the
wild
geese
went
up
to
him
with
much
bowing
and
scraping
well
met
in
the
wilderness
they
greeted
but
the
big
ram
lay
still
and
did
not
speak
a
word
of
welcome
then
the
wild
geese
thought
that
the
sheep
were
displeased
because
they
had
taken
shelter
in
their
grotto
it
is
perhaps
not
permissible
that
we
have
come
in
here
said
akka
but
we
can
not
help
it
for
we
are
we
have
wandered
about
in
the
storm
all
day
and
it
would
be
very
good
to
be
allowed
to
stop
here
after
that
a
long
time
passed
before
any
of
the
sheep
answered
with
words
but
on
the
other
hand
it
could
be
heard
distinctly
that
a
pair
of
them
heaved
deep
sighs
akka
knew
to
be
sure
that
sheep
are
always
shy
and
peculiar
but
these
seemed
to
have
no
idea
of
how
they
should
conduct
themselves
finally
an
old
ewe
who
had
a
long
and
pathetic
face
and
a
doleful
voice
said
there
is
one
among
us
that
refuses
to
let
you
stay
but
this
is
a
house
of
mourning
and
we
can
not
receive
guests
as
we
did
in
former
days
you
need
worry
about
anything
of
that
sort
said
akka
if
you
knew
what
we
have
endured
this
day
you
would
surely
understand
that
we
are
satisfied
if
we
only
get
a
safe
spot
to
sleep
on
when
akka
said
this
the
old
ewe
raised
herself
i
believe
that
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
fly
about
in
the
worst
storm
than
to
stop
here
but
at
least
you
shall
not
go
from
here
before
we
have
had
the
privilege
of
offering
you
the
best
hospitality
which
the
house
affords
she
conducted
them
to
a
hollow
in
the
ground
which
was
filled
with
water
beside
it
lay
a
pile
of
bait
and
husks
and
chaff
and
she
bade
them
make
the
most
of
these
we
have
had
a
severe
this
year
on
the
island
she
said
the
peasants
who
own
us
came
out
to
us
with
hay
and
oaten
straw
so
we
should
starve
to
death
and
this
trash
is
all
there
is
left
of
the
good
cheer
the
geese
rushed
to
the
food
instantly
they
thought
that
they
had
fared
well
and
were
in
their
best
humour
they
must
have
observed
of
course
that
the
sheep
were
anxious
but
they
knew
how
easily
scared
sheep
generally
are
and
did
believe
there
was
any
actual
danger
on
foot
as
soon
as
they
had
eaten
they
intended
to
stand
up
to
sleep
as
usual
but
then
the
big
ram
got
up
and
walked
over
to
them
the
geese
thought
that
they
had
never
seen
a
sheep
with
such
big
and
coarse
horns
in
other
respects
also
he
was
noticeable
he
had
a
high
rolling
forehead
intelligent
eyes
and
a
good
bearing
as
though
he
were
a
proud
and
courageous
animal
i
can
not
assume
the
responsibility
of
letting
you
geese
remain
without
telling
you
that
it
is
unsafe
here
said
he
we
can
not
receive
night
guests
just
now
at
last
akka
began
to
comprehend
that
this
was
serious
we
shall
go
away
since
you
really
wish
it
said
she
but
wo
you
tell
us
first
what
it
is
that
troubles
you
we
know
nothing
about
it
we
do
not
even
know
where
we
are
this
is
little
island
said
the
ram
it
lies
outside
of
gottland
and
only
sheep
and
seabirds
live
here
perhaps
you
are
wild
sheep
said
akka
we
not
far
removed
from
it
replied
the
ram
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
human
beings
it
an
old
agreement
between
us
and
some
peasants
on
a
farm
in
gottland
that
they
shall
supply
us
with
fodder
in
case
we
have
and
as
a
recompense
they
are
permitted
to
take
away
those
of
us
who
become
superfluous
the
island
is
small
so
it
can
not
feed
very
many
of
us
but
otherwise
we
take
care
of
ourselves
all
the
year
round
and
we
do
not
live
in
houses
with
doors
and
locks
but
we
reside
in
grottoes
like
these
do
you
stay
out
here
in
the
winter
as
well
asked
akka
surprised
we
do
answered
the
ram
we
have
good
fodder
up
here
on
the
mountain
all
the
year
around
i
think
it
sounds
as
if
you
might
have
it
better
than
other
sheep
said
akka
but
what
is
the
misfortune
that
has
befallen
you
it
was
bitter
cold
last
winter
the
sea
froze
and
then
three
foxes
came
over
here
on
the
ice
and
here
they
have
been
ever
since
otherwise
there
are
no
dangerous
animals
here
on
the
island
oh
oh
do
foxes
dare
to
attack
such
as
you
oh
no
not
during
the
day
then
i
can
protect
myself
and
mine
said
the
ram
shaking
his
horns
but
they
sneak
upon
us
at
night
when
we
sleep
in
the
grottoes
we
try
to
keep
awake
but
one
must
sleep
some
of
the
time
and
then
they
come
upon
us
they
have
already
killed
every
sheep
in
the
other
grottoes
and
there
were
herds
that
were
just
as
large
as
mine
it
is
pleasant
to
tell
that
we
are
so
helpless
said
the
old
ewe
we
can
not
help
ourselves
any
better
than
if
we
were
tame
sheep
do
you
think
that
they
will
come
here
asked
akka
there
is
nothing
else
in
store
for
us
answered
the
old
ewe
they
were
here
last
night
and
stole
a
lamb
from
us
they
be
sure
to
come
again
as
long
as
there
are
any
of
us
alive
this
is
what
they
have
done
in
the
other
places
but
if
they
are
allowed
to
keep
this
up
you
become
entirely
exterminated
said
akka
oh
it
wo
be
long
before
it
is
all
over
with
the
sheep
on
little
karl
island
said
the
ewe
akka
stood
there
hesitatingly
it
was
not
pleasant
by
any
means
to
venture
out
in
the
storm
again
and
it
was
good
to
remain
in
a
house
where
such
guests
were
expected
when
she
had
pondered
a
while
she
turned
to
thumbietot
i
wonder
if
you
will
help
us
as
you
have
done
so
many
times
before
said
she
yes
that
he
would
like
to
do
he
replied
it
is
a
pity
for
you
not
to
get
any
sleep
said
the
wild
goose
but
i
wonder
if
you
are
able
to
keep
awake
until
the
foxes
come
and
then
to
awaken
us
so
we
may
fly
away
the
boy
was
so
very
glad
of
this
for
anything
was
better
than
to
go
out
in
the
storm
again
so
he
promised
to
keep
awake
he
went
down
to
the
grotto
opening
crawled
in
behind
a
stone
that
he
might
be
shielded
from
the
storm
and
sat
down
to
watch
when
the
boy
had
been
sitting
there
a
while
the
storm
seemed
to
abate
the
sky
grew
clear
and
the
moonlight
began
to
play
on
the
waves
the
boy
stepped
to
the
opening
to
look
out
the
grotto
was
rather
high
up
on
the
mountain
a
narrow
path
led
to
it
it
was
probably
here
that
he
must
await
the
foxes
as
yet
he
saw
no
foxes
but
on
the
other
hand
there
was
something
which
for
the
moment
terrified
him
much
more
on
the
below
the
mountain
stood
some
giants
or
other
or
perhaps
they
were
actual
human
beings
at
first
he
thought
that
he
was
dreaming
but
now
he
was
positive
that
he
had
not
fallen
asleep
he
saw
the
big
men
so
distinctly
that
it
could
be
an
illusion
some
of
them
stood
on
the
and
others
right
on
the
mountain
just
as
if
they
intended
to
climb
it
some
had
big
thick
heads
others
had
no
heads
at
all
some
were
and
some
had
humps
both
before
and
behind
he
had
never
seen
anything
so
extraordinary
the
boy
stood
and
worked
himself
into
a
state
of
panic
because
of
those
trolls
so
that
he
almost
forgot
to
keep
his
eye
peeled
for
the
foxes
but
now
he
heard
a
claw
scrape
against
a
stone
he
saw
three
foxes
coming
up
the
steep
and
as
soon
as
he
knew
that
he
had
something
real
to
deal
with
he
was
calm
again
and
not
the
least
bit
scared
it
struck
him
that
it
was
a
pity
to
awaken
only
the
geese
and
to
leave
the
sheep
to
their
fate
he
thought
he
would
like
to
arrange
things
some
other
way
he
ran
quickly
to
the
other
end
of
the
grotto
shook
the
big
ram
horns
until
he
awoke
and
at
the
same
time
swung
himself
upon
his
back
get
up
sheep
and
well
try
to
frighten
the
foxes
a
bit
said
the
boy
he
had
tried
to
be
as
quiet
as
possible
but
the
foxes
must
have
heard
some
noise
for
when
they
came
up
to
the
mouth
of
the
grotto
they
stopped
and
deliberated
it
was
certainly
someone
in
there
that
moved
said
one
i
wonder
if
they
are
awake
oh
go
ahead
you
said
another
at
all
events
they
ca
do
anything
to
us
when
they
came
farther
in
in
the
grotto
they
stopped
and
sniffed
who
shall
we
take
whispered
the
one
who
went
first
we
will
take
the
big
ram
said
the
last
after
that
we
have
easy
work
with
the
rest
the
boy
sat
on
the
old
ram
back
and
saw
how
they
sneaked
along
now
butt
straight
forward
whispered
the
boy
the
ram
butted
and
the
first
fox
was
thrust
top
over
tail
back
to
the
opening
now
butt
to
the
left
said
the
boy
and
turned
the
big
ram
head
in
that
direction
the
ram
measured
a
terrific
assault
that
caught
the
second
fox
in
the
side
he
rolled
around
several
times
before
he
got
to
his
feet
again
and
made
his
escape
the
boy
had
wished
that
the
third
one
too
might
have
gotten
a
bump
but
this
one
had
already
gone
now
i
think
that
they
had
enough
for
said
the
boy
i
think
so
too
said
the
big
ram
now
lie
down
on
my
back
and
creep
into
the
wool
you
deserve
to
have
it
warm
and
comfortable
after
all
the
wind
and
storm
that
you
have
been
out
in
hell
hole
the
next
day
the
big
ram
went
around
with
the
boy
on
his
back
and
showed
him
the
island
it
consisted
of
a
single
massive
mountain
it
was
like
a
large
house
with
perpendicular
walls
and
a
flat
roof
first
the
ram
walked
up
on
the
and
showed
the
boy
the
good
grazing
lands
there
and
he
had
to
admit
that
the
island
seemed
to
be
especially
created
for
sheep
there
was
much
else
than
and
such
little
spicy
growths
as
sheep
are
fond
of
that
grew
on
the
mountain
but
indeed
there
was
something
beside
sheep
fodder
to
look
at
for
one
who
had
gotten
well
up
on
the
steep
to
begin
with
the
largest
part
of
the
sea
which
now
lay
blue
and
sunlit
and
rolled
forward
in
glittering
swells
was
visible
only
upon
one
and
another
point
did
the
foam
spray
up
to
the
east
lay
gottland
with
even
and
coast
and
to
the
southwest
lay
great
karl
island
which
was
built
on
the
same
plan
as
the
little
island
when
the
ram
walked
to
the
very
edge
of
the
mountain
roof
so
the
boy
could
look
down
the
mountain
walls
he
noticed
that
they
were
simply
filled
with
birds
nests
and
in
the
blue
sea
beneath
him
lay
and
and
kittiwakes
and
guillemots
and
so
pretty
and
peaceful
busying
themselves
with
fishing
for
small
herring
this
is
really
a
favoured
land
said
the
boy
you
live
in
a
pretty
place
you
sheep
oh
yes
it
pretty
enough
here
said
the
big
ram
it
was
as
if
he
wished
to
add
something
but
he
did
not
only
sighed
if
you
go
about
here
alone
you
must
look
out
for
the
crevices
which
run
all
around
the
mountain
he
continued
after
a
little
and
this
was
a
good
warning
for
there
were
deep
and
broad
crevices
in
several
places
the
largest
of
them
was
called
hell
hole
that
crevice
was
many
fathoms
deep
and
nearly
one
fathom
wide
if
anyone
fell
down
there
it
would
certainly
be
the
last
of
him
said
the
big
ram
the
boy
thought
it
sounded
as
if
he
had
a
special
meaning
in
what
he
said
then
he
conducted
the
boy
down
to
the
narrow
strip
of
shore
now
he
could
see
those
giants
which
had
frightened
him
the
night
before
at
close
range
they
were
nothing
but
tall
the
big
ram
called
them
cliffs
the
boy
could
see
enough
of
them
he
thought
that
if
there
had
ever
been
any
trolls
who
had
turned
into
stone
they
ought
to
look
just
like
that
although
it
was
pretty
down
on
the
shore
the
boy
liked
it
still
better
on
the
mountain
height
it
was
ghastly
down
here
for
everywhere
they
came
across
dead
sheep
it
was
here
that
the
foxes
had
held
their
orgies
he
saw
skeletons
whose
flesh
had
been
eaten
and
bodies
that
were
and
others
which
they
had
scarcely
tasted
but
had
allowed
to
lie
untouched
it
was
to
see
how
the
wild
beasts
had
thrown
themselves
upon
the
sheep
just
for
sport
just
to
hunt
them
and
tear
them
to
death
the
big
ram
did
not
pause
in
front
of
the
dead
but
walked
by
them
in
silence
but
the
boy
meanwhile
could
not
help
seeing
all
the
horror
then
the
big
ram
went
up
on
the
mountain
height
again
but
when
he
was
there
he
stopped
and
said
if
someone
who
is
capable
and
wise
could
see
all
the
misery
which
prevails
here
he
surely
would
not
be
able
to
rest
until
these
foxes
had
been
punished
the
foxes
must
live
too
said
the
boy
yes
said
the
big
ram
those
who
do
not
tear
in
pieces
more
animals
than
they
need
for
their
sustenance
they
may
as
well
live
but
these
are
felons
the
peasants
who
own
the
island
ought
to
come
here
and
help
you
insisted
the
boy
they
have
rowed
over
a
number
of
times
replied
the
ram
but
the
foxes
always
hid
themselves
in
the
grottoes
and
crevices
so
they
could
not
get
near
them
to
shoot
them
you
surely
can
not
mean
father
that
a
poor
little
creature
like
me
should
be
able
to
get
at
them
when
neither
you
nor
the
peasants
have
succeeded
in
getting
the
better
of
them
he
that
is
little
and
spry
can
put
many
things
to
rights
said
the
big
ram
they
talked
no
more
about
this
and
the
boy
went
over
and
seated
himself
among
the
wild
geese
who
fed
on
the
highland
although
he
had
not
cared
to
show
his
feelings
before
the
ram
he
was
very
sad
on
the
account
and
he
would
have
been
glad
to
help
them
i
can
at
least
talk
with
akka
and
morten
about
the
matter
thought
he
perhaps
they
can
help
me
with
a
good
suggestion
a
little
later
the
white
took
the
boy
on
his
back
and
went
over
the
mountain
plain
and
in
the
direction
of
hell
hole
at
that
he
wandered
on
the
open
mountain
roof
apparently
unconscious
of
how
large
and
white
he
was
he
did
seek
protection
behind
tufts
or
any
other
protuberances
but
went
straight
ahead
it
was
strange
that
he
was
not
more
careful
for
it
was
apparent
that
he
had
fared
badly
in
yesterday
storm
he
limped
on
his
right
leg
and
the
left
wing
hung
and
dragged
as
if
it
might
be
broken
he
acted
as
if
there
were
no
danger
pecked
at
a
here
and
another
there
and
did
not
look
about
him
in
any
direction
the
boy
lay
stretched
out
full
length
on
the
and
looked
up
toward
the
blue
sky
he
was
so
accustomed
to
riding
now
that
he
could
both
stand
and
lie
down
on
the
when
the
and
the
boy
were
so
they
did
not
observe
of
course
that
the
three
foxes
had
come
up
on
the
mountain
plain
and
the
foxes
who
knew
that
it
was
impossible
to
take
the
life
of
a
goose
on
an
open
plain
thought
at
first
that
they
chase
after
the
but
as
they
had
nothing
else
to
do
they
finally
sneaked
down
on
one
of
the
long
passes
and
tried
to
steal
up
to
him
they
went
about
it
so
cautiously
that
the
see
a
shadow
of
them
they
were
not
far
off
when
the
made
an
attempt
to
raise
himself
into
the
air
he
spread
his
wings
but
he
did
not
succeed
in
lifting
himself
when
the
foxes
seemed
to
grasp
the
fact
that
he
could
fly
they
hurried
forward
with
greater
eagerness
than
before
they
no
longer
concealed
themselves
in
the
cleft
but
came
up
on
the
highland
they
hurried
as
fast
as
they
could
behind
tufts
and
hollows
and
came
nearer
and
nearer
the
without
his
seeming
to
notice
that
he
was
being
hunted
at
last
the
foxes
were
so
near
that
they
could
make
the
final
leap
simultaneously
all
three
threw
themselves
with
one
long
jump
at
the
but
still
at
the
last
moment
he
must
have
noticed
something
for
he
ran
out
of
the
way
so
the
foxes
missed
him
this
at
any
rate
did
mean
very
much
for
the
only
had
a
couple
of
metres
headway
and
in
the
bargain
he
limped
anyway
the
poor
thing
ran
ahead
as
fast
as
he
could
the
boy
sat
upon
the
backward
and
shrieked
and
called
to
the
foxes
you
have
eaten
yourselves
too
fat
on
mutton
foxes
you
ca
catch
up
with
a
goose
even
he
teased
them
so
that
they
became
crazed
with
rage
and
thought
only
of
rushing
forward
the
white
one
ran
right
straight
to
the
big
cleft
when
he
was
there
he
made
one
stroke
with
his
wings
and
got
over
just
then
the
foxes
were
almost
upon
him
the
hurried
on
with
the
same
haste
as
before
even
after
he
had
gotten
across
hell
hole
but
he
had
hardly
been
running
two
metres
before
the
boy
patted
him
on
the
neck
and
said
now
you
can
stop
at
that
instant
they
heard
a
number
of
wild
howls
behind
them
and
a
scraping
of
claws
and
heavy
falls
but
of
the
foxes
they
saw
nothing
more
the
next
morning
the
lighthouse
keeper
on
great
karl
island
found
a
bit
of
bark
poked
under
the
and
on
it
had
been
cut
in
slanting
angular
letters
the
foxes
on
the
little
island
have
fallen
down
into
hell
hole
take
care
of
them
and
this
the
lighthouse
keeper
did
too
two
cities
the
city
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
april
it
was
a
calm
and
clear
night
the
wild
geese
did
not
trouble
themselves
to
seek
shelter
in
any
of
the
grottoes
but
stood
and
slept
upon
the
mountain
top
and
the
boy
had
lain
down
in
the
short
dry
grass
beside
the
geese
it
was
bright
moonlight
that
night
so
bright
that
it
was
difficult
for
the
boy
to
go
to
sleep
he
lay
there
and
thought
about
just
how
long
he
had
been
away
from
home
and
he
figured
out
that
it
was
three
weeks
since
he
had
started
on
the
trip
at
the
same
time
he
remembered
that
this
was
it
is
that
all
the
witches
come
home
from
blakulla
thought
he
and
laughed
to
himself
for
he
was
just
a
little
afraid
of
both
the
and
the
elf
but
he
did
believe
in
witches
the
least
little
bit
if
there
had
been
any
witches
out
that
night
he
should
have
seen
them
to
be
sure
it
was
so
light
in
the
heavens
that
not
the
tiniest
black
speck
could
move
in
the
air
without
his
seeing
it
while
the
boy
lay
there
with
his
nose
in
the
air
and
thought
about
this
his
eye
rested
on
something
lovely
the
moon
disc
was
whole
and
round
and
rather
high
and
over
it
a
big
bird
came
flying
he
did
not
fly
past
the
moon
but
he
moved
just
as
though
he
might
have
flown
out
from
it
the
bird
looked
black
against
the
light
background
and
the
wings
extended
from
one
rim
of
the
disc
to
the
other
he
flew
on
evenly
in
the
same
direction
and
the
boy
thought
that
he
was
painted
on
the
moon
disc
the
body
was
small
the
neck
long
and
slender
the
legs
hung
down
long
and
thin
it
could
be
anything
but
a
stork
a
couple
of
seconds
later
herr
ermenrich
the
stork
lit
beside
the
boy
he
bent
down
and
poked
him
with
his
bill
to
awaken
him
instantly
the
boy
sat
up
i
not
asleep
herr
ermenrich
he
said
how
does
it
happen
that
you
are
out
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
how
is
everything
at
glimminge
castle
do
you
want
to
speak
with
mother
akka
it
too
light
to
sleep
answered
herr
ermenrich
therefore
i
concluded
to
travel
over
here
to
karl
island
and
hunt
you
up
friend
thumbietot
i
learned
from
the
seamew
that
you
were
spending
the
night
here
i
have
not
as
yet
moved
over
to
glimminge
castle
but
am
still
living
at
pommern
the
boy
was
simply
overjoyed
to
think
that
herr
ermenrich
had
sought
him
out
they
chatted
about
all
sorts
of
things
like
old
friends
at
last
the
stork
asked
the
boy
if
he
would
like
to
go
out
riding
for
a
while
on
this
beautiful
night
oh
yes
that
the
boy
wanted
to
do
if
the
stork
would
manage
it
so
that
he
got
back
to
the
wild
geese
before
sunrise
this
he
promised
so
off
they
went
again
herr
ermenrich
flew
straight
toward
the
moon
they
rose
and
rose
the
sea
sank
deep
down
but
the
flight
went
so
light
and
easy
that
it
seemed
almost
as
if
the
boy
lay
still
in
the
air
when
herr
ermenrich
began
to
descend
the
boy
thought
that
the
flight
had
lasted
an
unreasonably
short
time
they
landed
on
a
desolate
bit
of
seashore
which
was
covered
with
fine
even
sand
all
along
the
coast
ran
a
row
of
drifts
with
on
their
tops
they
were
not
very
high
but
they
prevented
the
boy
from
seeing
any
of
the
island
herr
ermenrich
stood
on
a
drew
up
one
leg
and
bent
his
head
backward
so
he
could
stick
his
bill
under
the
wing
you
can
roam
around
on
the
shore
for
a
while
he
said
to
thumbietot
while
i
rest
myself
but
do
go
so
far
away
but
what
you
can
find
your
way
back
to
me
again
to
start
with
the
boy
intended
to
climb
a
and
see
how
the
land
behind
it
looked
but
when
he
had
walked
a
couple
of
paces
he
stubbed
the
toe
of
his
wooden
shoe
against
something
hard
he
stooped
down
and
saw
that
a
small
copper
coin
lay
on
the
sand
and
was
so
worn
with
verdigris
that
it
was
almost
transparent
it
was
so
poor
that
he
did
even
bother
to
pick
it
up
but
only
kicked
it
out
of
the
way
but
when
he
straightened
himself
up
once
more
he
was
perfectly
astounded
for
two
paces
away
from
him
stood
a
high
dark
wall
with
a
big
turreted
gate
the
moment
before
when
the
boy
bent
down
the
sea
lay
there
shimmering
and
smooth
while
now
it
was
hidden
by
a
long
wall
with
towers
and
battlements
directly
in
front
of
him
where
before
there
had
been
only
a
few
banks
the
big
gate
of
the
wall
opened
the
boy
probably
understood
that
it
was
a
of
some
sort
but
this
was
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
thought
he
it
was
any
dangerous
trolls
or
any
other
evil
such
as
he
always
dreaded
to
encounter
at
night
both
the
wall
and
the
gate
were
so
beautifully
constructed
that
he
only
desired
to
see
what
there
might
be
back
of
them
i
must
find
out
what
this
can
be
thought
he
and
went
in
through
the
gate
in
the
deep
archway
there
were
guards
dressed
in
brocaded
and
purred
suits
with
spears
beside
them
who
sat
and
threw
dice
they
thought
only
of
the
game
and
took
no
notice
of
the
boy
who
hurried
past
them
quickly
just
within
the
gate
he
found
an
open
space
paved
with
large
even
stone
blocks
all
around
this
were
high
and
magnificent
buildings
and
between
these
opened
long
narrow
streets
on
the
square
facing
the
gate
it
fairly
swarmed
with
human
beings
the
men
wore
long
capes
over
satin
suits
hats
sat
obliquely
on
their
heads
on
their
chests
hung
superb
chains
they
were
all
so
regally
gotten
up
that
the
whole
lot
of
them
might
have
been
kings
the
women
went
about
in
high
and
long
robes
with
sleeves
they
too
were
beautifully
dressed
but
their
splendour
was
not
to
be
compared
with
that
of
the
men
this
was
exactly
like
the
old
which
mother
took
from
the
chest
only
once
and
showed
to
him
the
boy
simply
could
believe
his
eyes
but
that
which
was
even
more
wonderful
to
look
upon
than
either
the
men
or
the
women
was
the
city
itself
every
house
was
built
in
such
a
way
that
a
gable
faced
the
street
and
the
gables
were
so
highly
ornamented
that
one
could
believe
they
wished
to
compete
with
each
other
as
to
which
one
could
show
the
most
beautiful
decorations
when
one
suddenly
sees
so
much
that
is
new
he
can
not
manage
to
treasure
it
all
in
his
memory
but
at
least
the
boy
could
recall
that
he
had
seen
stairway
gables
on
the
various
landings
which
bore
images
of
the
christ
and
his
apostles
gables
where
there
were
images
in
niche
after
niche
all
along
the
wall
gables
that
were
inlaid
with
bits
of
glass
and
gables
that
were
striped
and
checked
with
white
and
black
marble
as
the
boy
admired
all
this
a
sudden
sense
of
haste
came
over
him
anything
like
this
my
eyes
have
never
seen
before
anything
like
this
they
would
never
see
again
he
said
to
himself
and
he
began
to
run
in
toward
the
city
up
one
street
and
down
another
the
streets
were
straight
and
narrow
but
not
empty
and
gloomy
as
they
were
in
the
cities
with
which
he
was
familiar
there
were
people
everywhere
old
women
sat
by
their
open
doors
and
spun
without
a
only
with
the
help
of
a
shuttle
the
merchants
shops
were
like
opening
on
the
street
all
the
did
their
work
out
of
doors
in
one
place
they
were
boiling
crude
oil
in
another
tanning
hides
in
a
third
there
was
a
long
if
only
the
boy
had
had
time
enough
he
could
have
learned
how
to
make
all
sorts
of
things
here
he
saw
how
armourers
hammered
out
thin
how
turners
tended
their
irons
how
the
shoemakers
soled
soft
red
shoes
how
the
drawers
twisted
gold
thread
and
how
the
weavers
inserted
silver
and
gold
into
their
weaving
but
the
boy
did
not
have
the
time
to
stay
he
just
rushed
on
so
that
he
could
manage
to
see
as
much
as
possible
before
it
would
all
vanish
again
the
high
wall
ran
all
around
the
city
and
shut
it
in
as
a
hedge
shuts
in
a
field
he
saw
it
at
the
end
of
every
street
and
crenelated
on
the
top
of
the
wall
walked
warriors
in
shining
armour
and
when
he
had
run
from
one
end
of
the
city
to
the
other
he
came
to
still
another
gate
in
the
wall
outside
of
this
lay
the
sea
and
harbour
the
boy
saw
ships
with
straight
across
and
high
structures
fore
and
aft
some
lay
and
took
on
cargo
others
were
just
casting
anchor
carriers
and
merchants
hurried
around
each
other
all
over
it
was
life
and
bustle
but
not
even
here
did
he
seem
to
have
the
time
to
linger
he
rushed
into
the
city
again
and
now
he
came
up
to
the
big
square
there
stood
the
cathedral
with
its
three
high
towers
and
deep
vaulted
arches
filled
with
images
the
walls
had
been
so
highly
decorated
by
sculptors
that
there
was
not
a
stone
without
its
own
special
ornamentation
and
what
a
magnificent
display
of
gilded
crosses
and
altars
and
priests
in
golden
vestments
shimmered
through
the
open
gate
directly
opposite
the
church
there
was
a
house
with
a
notched
roof
and
a
single
slender
tower
that
was
probably
the
courthouse
and
between
the
courthouse
and
the
cathedral
all
around
the
square
stood
the
beautiful
gabled
houses
with
their
multiplicity
of
adornments
the
boy
had
run
himself
both
warm
and
tired
he
thought
that
now
he
had
seen
the
most
remarkable
things
and
therefore
he
began
to
walk
more
leisurely
the
street
which
he
had
turned
into
now
was
surely
the
one
where
the
inhabitants
purchased
their
fine
clothing
he
saw
crowds
of
people
standing
before
the
little
stalls
where
the
merchants
spread
brocades
stiff
satins
heavy
gold
cloth
shimmery
velvet
delicate
veiling
and
laces
as
sheer
as
a
spider
web
before
when
the
boy
ran
so
fast
no
one
had
paid
any
attention
to
him
the
people
must
have
thought
that
it
was
only
a
little
gray
rat
that
darted
by
them
but
now
when
he
walked
down
the
street
very
slowly
one
of
the
salesmen
caught
sight
of
him
and
began
to
beckon
to
him
at
first
the
boy
was
uneasy
and
wanted
to
hurry
out
of
the
way
but
the
salesman
only
beckoned
and
smiled
and
spread
out
on
the
counter
a
lovely
piece
of
satin
damask
as
if
he
wanted
to
tempt
him
the
boy
shook
his
head
i
will
never
be
so
rich
that
i
can
buy
even
a
metre
of
that
cloth
thought
he
but
now
they
had
caught
sight
of
him
in
every
stall
all
along
the
street
wherever
he
looked
stood
a
salesman
and
beckoned
to
him
they
left
their
costly
wares
and
thought
only
of
him
he
saw
how
they
hurried
into
the
most
hidden
corner
of
the
stall
to
fetch
the
best
that
they
had
to
sell
and
how
their
hands
trembled
with
eagerness
and
haste
as
they
laid
it
upon
the
counter
when
the
boy
continued
to
go
on
one
of
the
merchants
jumped
over
the
counter
caught
hold
of
him
and
spread
before
him
silver
cloth
and
woven
tapestries
which
shone
with
brilliant
colours
the
boy
could
do
anything
but
laugh
at
him
the
salesman
certainly
must
understand
that
a
poor
little
creature
like
him
could
buy
such
things
he
stood
still
and
held
out
his
two
empty
hands
so
they
would
understand
that
he
had
nothing
and
let
him
go
in
peace
but
the
merchant
raised
a
finger
and
nodded
and
pushed
the
whole
pile
of
beautiful
things
over
to
him
can
he
mean
that
he
will
sell
all
this
for
a
gold
piece
wondered
the
boy
the
merchant
brought
out
a
tiny
worn
and
poor
coin
the
smallest
that
one
could
see
and
showed
it
to
him
and
he
was
so
eager
to
sell
that
he
increased
his
pile
with
a
pair
of
large
heavy
silver
goblets
then
the
boy
began
to
dig
down
in
his
pockets
he
knew
of
course
that
he
did
possess
a
single
coin
but
he
could
help
feeling
for
it
all
the
other
merchants
stood
still
and
tried
to
see
how
the
sale
would
come
off
and
when
they
observed
that
the
boy
began
to
search
in
his
pockets
they
flung
themselves
over
the
counters
filled
their
hands
full
of
gold
and
silver
ornaments
and
offered
them
to
him
and
they
all
showed
him
that
what
they
asked
in
payment
was
just
one
little
penny
but
the
boy
turned
both
vest
and
breeches
pockets
inside
out
so
they
should
see
that
he
owned
nothing
then
tears
filled
the
eyes
of
all
these
regal
merchants
who
were
so
much
richer
than
he
at
last
he
was
moved
because
they
looked
so
distressed
and
he
pondered
if
he
could
not
in
some
way
help
them
and
then
he
happened
to
think
of
the
rusty
coin
which
he
had
but
lately
seen
on
the
strand
he
started
to
run
down
the
street
and
luck
was
with
him
so
that
he
came
to
the
gate
which
he
had
happened
upon
first
he
dashed
through
it
and
commenced
to
search
for
the
little
green
copper
penny
which
lay
on
the
strand
a
while
ago
he
found
it
too
very
promptly
but
when
he
had
picked
it
up
and
wanted
to
run
back
to
the
city
with
it
he
saw
only
the
sea
before
him
no
city
wall
no
gate
no
sentinels
no
streets
no
houses
could
now
be
seen
only
the
sea
the
boy
could
help
that
the
tears
came
to
his
eyes
he
had
believed
in
the
beginning
that
that
which
he
saw
was
nothing
but
an
hallucination
but
this
he
had
already
forgotten
he
only
thought
about
how
pretty
everything
was
he
felt
a
genuine
deep
sorrow
because
the
city
had
vanished
that
moment
herr
ermenrich
awoke
and
came
up
to
him
but
he
did
hear
him
and
the
stork
had
to
poke
the
boy
with
his
bill
to
attract
attention
to
himself
i
believe
that
you
stand
here
and
sleep
just
as
i
do
said
herr
ermenrich
oh
herr
ermenrich
said
the
boy
what
was
that
city
which
stood
here
just
now
have
you
seen
a
city
said
the
stork
you
have
slept
and
dreamt
as
i
say
no
i
have
not
dreamt
said
thumbietot
and
he
told
the
stork
all
that
he
had
experienced
then
herr
ermenrich
said
for
my
part
thumbietot
i
believe
that
you
fell
asleep
here
on
the
strand
and
dreamed
all
this
but
i
will
not
conceal
from
you
that
bataki
the
raven
who
is
the
most
learned
of
all
birds
once
told
me
that
in
former
times
there
was
a
city
on
this
shore
called
vineta
it
was
so
rich
and
so
fortunate
that
no
city
has
ever
been
more
glorious
but
its
inhabitants
unluckily
gave
themselves
up
to
arrogance
and
love
of
display
as
a
punishment
for
this
says
bataki
the
city
of
vineta
was
overtaken
by
a
flood
and
sank
into
the
sea
but
its
inhabitants
can
not
die
neither
is
their
city
destroyed
and
one
night
in
every
hundred
years
it
rises
in
all
its
splendour
up
from
the
sea
and
remains
on
the
surface
just
one
hour
yes
it
must
be
so
said
thumbietot
for
this
i
have
seen
but
when
the
hour
is
up
it
sinks
again
into
the
sea
if
during
that
time
no
merchant
in
vineta
has
sold
anything
to
a
single
living
creature
if
you
thumbietot
only
had
had
an
ever
so
tiny
coin
to
pay
the
merchants
vineta
might
have
remained
up
here
on
the
shore
and
its
people
could
have
lived
and
died
like
other
human
beings
herr
ermenrich
said
the
boy
now
i
understand
why
you
came
and
fetched
me
in
the
middle
of
the
night
it
was
because
you
believed
that
i
should
be
able
to
save
the
old
city
i
am
so
sorry
it
did
turn
out
as
you
wished
herr
ermenrich
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
wept
it
was
easy
to
say
which
one
looked
the
more
disconsolate
the
boy
or
herr
ermenrich
the
living
city
april
on
the
afternoon
of
easter
monday
the
wild
geese
and
thumbietot
were
on
the
wing
they
travelled
over
gottland
the
large
island
lay
smooth
and
even
beneath
them
the
ground
was
checked
just
as
it
was
in
skåne
and
there
were
many
churches
and
farms
but
there
was
this
difference
however
that
there
were
more
leafy
meadows
between
the
fields
here
and
then
the
farms
were
not
built
up
with
small
houses
and
there
were
no
large
manors
with
ancient
castles
the
wild
geese
had
taken
the
route
over
gottland
on
account
of
thumbietot
he
had
been
altogether
unlike
himself
for
two
days
and
had
spoken
a
cheerful
word
this
was
because
he
had
thought
of
nothing
but
that
city
which
had
appeared
to
him
in
such
a
strange
way
he
had
never
seen
anything
so
magnificent
and
royal
and
he
could
not
be
reconciled
with
himself
for
having
failed
to
save
it
usually
he
was
not
but
now
he
actually
grieved
for
the
beautiful
buildings
and
the
stately
people
both
akka
and
the
tried
to
convince
thumbietot
that
he
had
been
the
victim
of
a
dream
or
an
hallucination
but
the
boy
listen
to
anything
of
that
sort
he
was
so
positive
that
he
had
really
seen
what
he
had
seen
that
no
one
could
move
him
from
this
conviction
he
went
about
so
disconsolate
that
his
travelling
companions
became
uneasy
for
him
just
as
the
boy
was
the
most
depressed
old
kaksi
came
back
to
the
flock
she
had
been
blown
toward
gottland
and
had
been
compelled
to
travel
over
the
whole
island
before
she
had
learned
through
some
crows
that
her
comrades
were
on
little
karl
island
when
kaksi
found
out
what
was
wrong
with
thumbietot
she
said
impulsively
if
thumbietot
is
grieving
over
an
old
city
we
soon
be
able
to
comfort
him
just
come
along
and
i
take
you
to
a
place
that
i
saw
yesterday
you
will
not
need
to
be
distressed
very
long
thereupon
the
geese
had
taken
farewell
of
the
sheep
and
were
on
their
way
to
the
place
which
kaksi
wished
to
show
thumbietot
as
blue
as
he
was
he
could
keep
from
looking
at
the
land
over
which
he
travelled
as
usual
he
thought
it
looked
as
though
the
whole
island
had
in
the
beginning
been
just
such
a
high
steep
cliff
as
karl
island
though
much
bigger
of
course
but
afterward
it
had
in
some
way
been
flattened
out
someone
had
taken
a
big
and
rolled
over
it
as
if
it
had
been
a
lump
of
dough
not
that
the
island
had
become
altogether
flat
and
even
like
a
for
it
was
like
that
while
they
had
travelled
along
the
coast
he
had
seen
white
lime
walls
with
grottoes
and
crags
in
several
directions
but
in
most
of
the
places
they
were
levelled
and
sank
inconspicuously
down
toward
the
sea
in
gottland
they
had
a
pleasant
and
peaceful
holiday
afternoon
it
turned
out
to
be
mild
spring
weather
the
trees
had
large
buds
spring
blossoms
dressed
the
ground
in
the
leafy
meadows
the
poplars
long
thin
pendants
swayed
and
in
the
little
gardens
which
one
finds
around
every
cottage
the
gooseberry
bushes
were
green
the
warmth
and
the
had
tempted
the
people
out
into
the
gardens
and
roads
and
wherever
a
number
of
them
were
gathered
together
they
were
playing
it
was
not
the
children
alone
who
played
but
the
also
they
were
throwing
stones
at
a
given
point
and
they
threw
balls
in
the
air
with
such
exact
aim
that
they
almost
touched
the
wild
geese
it
looked
cheerful
and
pleasant
to
see
big
folks
at
play
and
the
boy
certainly
would
have
enjoyed
it
if
he
had
been
able
to
forget
his
grief
because
he
had
failed
to
save
the
city
anyway
he
had
to
admit
that
this
was
a
lovely
trip
there
was
so
much
singing
and
sound
in
the
air
little
children
played
ring
games
and
sang
as
they
played
the
salvation
army
was
out
he
saw
a
lot
of
people
dressed
in
black
and
red
sitting
upon
a
wooded
hill
playing
on
guitars
and
brass
instruments
on
one
road
came
a
great
crowd
of
people
they
were
good
templars
who
had
been
on
a
pleasure
trip
he
recognized
them
by
the
big
banners
with
the
gold
inscriptions
which
waved
above
them
they
sang
song
after
song
as
long
as
he
could
hear
them
after
that
the
boy
could
never
think
of
gottland
without
thinking
of
the
games
and
songs
at
the
same
time
he
had
been
sitting
and
looking
down
for
a
long
while
but
now
he
happened
to
raise
his
eyes
no
one
can
describe
his
amazement
before
he
was
aware
of
it
the
wild
geese
had
left
the
interior
of
the
island
and
gone
westward
toward
the
now
the
wide
blue
sea
lay
before
him
however
it
was
not
the
sea
that
was
remarkable
but
a
city
which
appeared
on
the
the
boy
came
from
the
east
and
the
sun
had
just
begun
to
go
down
in
the
west
when
he
came
nearer
the
city
its
walls
and
towers
and
high
gabled
houses
and
churches
stood
there
perfectly
black
against
the
light
evening
sky
he
could
see
therefore
what
it
really
looked
like
and
for
a
couple
of
moments
he
believed
that
this
city
was
just
as
beautiful
as
the
one
he
had
seen
on
easter
night
when
he
got
right
up
to
it
he
saw
that
it
was
both
like
and
unlike
that
city
from
the
bottom
of
the
sea
there
was
the
same
contrast
between
them
as
there
is
between
a
man
whom
one
sees
arrayed
in
purple
and
jewels
one
day
and
on
another
day
one
sees
him
dressed
in
rags
yes
this
city
had
probably
once
upon
a
time
been
like
the
one
which
he
sat
and
thought
about
this
one
also
was
enclosed
by
a
wall
with
towers
and
gates
but
the
towers
in
this
city
which
had
been
allowed
to
remain
on
land
were
roofless
hollow
and
empty
the
gates
were
without
doors
sentinels
and
warriors
had
disappeared
all
the
glittering
splendour
was
gone
there
was
nothing
left
but
the
naked
gray
stone
skeleton
when
the
boy
came
farther
into
the
city
he
saw
that
the
larger
part
of
it
was
made
up
of
small
low
houses
but
here
and
there
were
still
a
few
high
gabled
houses
and
a
few
cathedrals
which
were
from
the
olden
time
the
walls
of
the
gabled
houses
were
whitewashed
and
entirely
without
ornamentation
but
because
the
boy
had
so
lately
seen
the
buried
city
he
seemed
to
understand
how
they
had
been
decorated
some
with
statues
and
others
with
black
and
white
marble
and
it
was
the
same
with
the
old
cathedrals
the
majority
of
them
were
roofless
with
bare
interiors
the
window
openings
were
empty
the
floors
were
and
ivy
clambered
along
the
walls
but
now
he
knew
how
they
had
looked
at
one
time
that
they
had
been
covered
with
images
and
paintings
that
the
chancel
had
had
trimmed
altars
and
gilded
crosses
and
that
their
priests
had
moved
about
arrayed
in
gold
vestments
the
boy
saw
also
the
narrow
streets
which
were
almost
deserted
on
holiday
afternoons
he
knew
he
did
what
a
stream
of
stately
people
had
once
upon
a
time
sauntered
about
on
them
he
knew
that
they
had
been
like
large
workshops
filled
with
all
sorts
of
workmen
but
that
which
nils
holgersson
did
not
see
was
that
the
city
even
was
both
beautiful
and
remarkable
he
saw
neither
the
cheery
cottages
on
the
side
streets
with
their
black
walls
and
white
bows
and
red
pelargoniums
behind
the
shining
nor
the
many
pretty
gardens
and
avenues
nor
the
beauty
in
the
ruins
his
eyes
were
so
filled
with
the
preceding
glory
that
he
could
not
see
anything
good
in
the
present
the
wild
geese
flew
back
and
forth
over
the
city
a
couple
of
times
so
that
thumbietot
might
see
everything
finally
they
sank
down
on
the
floor
of
a
cathedral
ruin
to
spend
the
night
when
they
had
arranged
themselves
for
sleep
thumbietot
was
still
awake
and
looked
up
through
the
open
arches
to
the
pale
pink
evening
sky
when
he
had
been
sitting
there
a
while
he
thought
he
did
want
to
grieve
any
more
because
he
could
save
the
buried
city
no
that
he
did
want
to
do
now
that
he
had
seen
this
one
if
that
city
which
he
had
seen
had
not
sunk
into
the
sea
again
then
it
would
perhaps
become
as
dilapidated
as
this
one
in
a
little
while
perhaps
it
could
not
have
withstood
time
and
decay
but
would
have
stood
there
with
roofless
churches
and
bare
houses
and
desolate
empty
streets
just
like
this
one
then
it
was
better
that
it
should
remain
in
all
its
glory
down
in
the
deep
it
was
best
that
it
happened
as
it
happened
thought
he
if
i
had
the
power
to
save
the
city
i
do
believe
that
i
should
care
to
do
it
then
he
no
longer
grieved
over
that
matter
and
there
are
probably
many
among
the
young
who
think
in
the
same
way
but
when
people
are
old
and
have
become
accustomed
to
being
satisfied
with
little
then
they
are
more
happy
over
the
visby
that
exists
than
over
a
magnificent
vineta
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
the
legend
of
småland
april
the
wild
geese
had
made
a
good
trip
over
the
sea
and
had
lighted
in
tjust
township
in
northern
småland
that
township
did
seem
able
to
make
up
its
mind
whether
it
wanted
to
be
land
or
sea
fiords
ran
in
everywhere
and
cut
the
land
up
into
islands
and
peninsulas
and
points
and
capes
the
sea
was
so
forceful
that
the
only
things
which
could
hold
themselves
above
it
were
hills
and
mountains
all
the
lowlands
were
hidden
away
under
the
water
exterior
it
was
evening
when
the
wild
geese
came
in
from
the
sea
and
the
land
with
the
little
hills
lay
prettily
between
the
shimmering
fiords
here
and
there
on
the
islands
the
boy
saw
cabins
and
cottages
and
the
farther
inland
he
came
the
bigger
and
better
became
the
dwelling
houses
finally
they
grew
into
large
white
manors
along
the
shores
there
was
generally
a
border
of
trees
and
within
this
lay
and
on
the
tops
of
the
little
hills
there
were
trees
again
he
could
not
help
but
think
of
blekinge
here
again
was
a
place
where
land
and
sea
met
in
such
a
pretty
and
peaceful
sort
of
way
just
as
if
they
tried
to
show
each
other
the
best
and
loveliest
which
they
possessed
the
wild
geese
alighted
upon
a
limestone
island
a
good
way
in
on
with
the
first
glance
at
the
shore
they
observed
that
spring
had
made
rapid
strides
while
they
had
been
away
on
the
islands
the
big
fine
trees
were
not
as
yet
but
the
ground
under
them
was
brocaded
with
white
anemones
gagea
and
blue
anemones
when
the
wild
geese
saw
the
they
feared
that
they
had
lingered
too
long
in
the
southern
part
of
the
country
akka
said
instantly
that
there
was
no
time
in
which
to
hunt
up
any
of
the
stopping
places
in
småland
by
the
next
morning
they
must
travel
northward
over
östergötland
the
boy
should
then
see
nothing
of
småland
and
this
grieved
him
he
had
heard
more
about
småland
than
he
had
about
any
other
province
and
he
had
longed
to
see
it
with
his
own
eyes
the
summer
before
when
he
had
served
as
with
a
farmer
in
the
neighbourhood
of
jordberga
he
had
met
a
pair
of
småland
children
almost
every
day
who
also
tended
geese
these
children
had
irritated
him
terribly
with
their
småland
it
was
fair
to
say
that
osa
the
had
annoyed
him
she
was
much
too
wise
for
that
but
the
one
who
could
be
aggravating
with
a
vengeance
was
her
brother
little
mats
have
you
heard
nils
how
it
went
when
småland
and
skåne
were
created
he
would
ask
and
if
nils
holgersson
said
no
he
began
immediately
to
relate
the
old
well
it
was
at
that
time
when
our
lord
was
creating
the
world
while
he
was
doing
his
best
work
saint
peter
came
walking
by
he
stopped
and
looked
on
and
then
he
asked
if
it
was
hard
to
do
it
exactly
easy
said
our
lord
saint
peter
stood
there
a
little
longer
and
when
he
noticed
how
easy
it
was
to
lay
out
one
landscape
after
another
he
too
wanted
to
try
his
hand
at
it
you
need
to
rest
yourself
a
little
said
saint
peter
could
attend
to
the
work
in
the
meantime
for
you
but
this
our
lord
did
not
wish
do
not
know
if
you
are
so
much
at
home
in
this
art
that
i
can
trust
you
to
take
hold
where
i
leave
off
he
answered
then
saint
peter
was
angry
and
said
that
he
believed
he
could
create
just
as
fine
countries
as
our
lord
himself
it
happened
that
our
lord
was
just
then
creating
småland
it
even
but
it
looked
as
though
it
would
be
an
indescribably
pretty
and
fertile
land
it
was
difficult
for
our
lord
to
say
no
to
saint
peter
and
aside
from
this
he
thought
very
likely
that
a
thing
so
well
begun
no
one
could
spoil
therefore
he
said
if
you
like
we
will
prove
which
one
of
us
two
understands
this
sort
of
work
the
better
you
who
are
only
a
novice
shall
go
on
with
this
which
i
have
begun
and
i
will
create
a
new
land
to
this
saint
peter
agreed
at
once
and
so
they
went
to
work
each
one
in
his
place
our
lord
moved
southward
a
bit
and
there
he
undertook
to
create
skåne
it
was
long
before
he
was
through
with
it
and
soon
he
asked
if
saint
peter
had
finished
and
would
come
and
look
at
his
work
had
mine
ready
long
ago
said
saint
peter
and
from
the
sound
of
his
voice
it
could
be
heard
how
pleased
he
was
with
what
he
had
accomplished
when
saint
peter
saw
skåne
he
had
to
acknowledge
that
there
was
nothing
but
good
to
be
said
of
that
land
it
was
a
fertile
land
and
easy
to
cultivate
with
wide
plains
wherever
one
looked
and
hardly
a
sign
of
hills
it
was
evident
that
our
lord
had
really
contemplated
making
it
such
that
people
should
feel
at
home
there
this
is
a
good
country
said
saint
peter
i
think
that
mine
is
better
we
take
a
look
at
it
said
our
lord
the
land
was
already
finished
in
the
north
and
east
when
saint
peter
began
the
work
but
the
southern
and
western
parts
and
the
whole
interior
he
had
created
all
by
himself
now
when
our
lord
came
up
there
where
saint
peter
had
been
at
work
he
was
so
horrified
that
he
stopped
short
and
exclaimed
on
earth
have
you
been
doing
with
this
land
saint
peter
saint
peter
too
stood
and
looked
around
perfectly
astonished
he
had
had
the
idea
that
nothing
could
be
so
good
for
a
land
as
a
great
deal
of
warmth
therefore
he
had
gathered
together
an
enormous
mass
of
stones
and
mountains
and
erected
a
highland
and
this
he
had
done
so
that
it
should
be
near
the
sun
and
receive
much
help
from
the
heat
over
the
he
had
spread
a
thin
layer
of
soil
and
then
he
had
thought
that
everything
was
well
arranged
but
while
he
was
down
in
skåne
a
couple
of
heavy
showers
had
come
up
and
more
was
not
needed
to
show
what
his
work
amounted
to
when
our
lord
came
to
inspect
the
land
all
the
soil
had
been
washed
away
and
the
naked
mountain
foundation
shone
forth
all
over
where
it
was
about
the
best
lay
clay
and
heavy
gravel
over
the
rocks
but
it
looked
so
poor
that
it
was
easy
to
understand
that
hardly
anything
except
spruce
and
juniper
and
moss
and
heather
could
grow
there
but
what
there
was
plenty
of
was
water
it
had
filled
up
all
the
clefts
in
the
mountain
and
lakes
and
rivers
and
brooks
these
one
saw
everywhere
to
say
nothing
of
swamps
and
morasses
which
spread
over
large
tracts
and
the
most
exasperating
thing
of
all
was
that
while
some
tracts
had
too
much
water
it
was
so
scarce
in
others
that
whole
fields
lay
like
dry
moors
where
sand
and
earth
whirled
up
in
clouds
with
the
least
little
breeze
can
have
been
your
meaning
in
creating
such
a
land
as
this
said
our
lord
saint
peter
made
excuses
and
declared
he
had
wished
to
build
up
a
land
so
high
that
it
should
have
plenty
of
warmth
from
the
sun
then
you
will
also
get
much
of
the
night
chill
said
our
lord
that
too
comes
from
heaven
i
am
very
much
afraid
the
little
that
can
grow
here
will
freeze
this
to
be
sure
saint
peter
had
thought
about
here
it
will
be
a
poor
and
land
said
our
lord
ca
be
helped
when
little
mats
had
gotten
this
far
in
his
story
osa
the
protested
i
can
not
bear
little
mats
to
hear
you
say
that
it
is
so
miserable
in
småland
said
she
you
forget
entirely
how
much
good
soil
there
is
there
only
think
of
möre
district
by
kalmar
sound
i
wonder
where
you
find
a
richer
grain
region
there
are
fields
upon
fields
just
like
here
in
skåne
the
soil
is
so
good
that
i
can
not
imagine
anything
that
could
grow
there
i
ca
help
that
said
little
mats
i
only
relating
what
others
have
said
before
and
i
have
heard
many
say
that
there
is
not
a
more
beautiful
coast
land
than
tjust
think
of
the
bays
and
islets
and
the
manors
and
the
groves
said
osa
yes
that
true
enough
little
mats
admitted
and
do
you
remember
continued
osa
the
school
teacher
said
that
such
a
lively
and
picturesque
district
as
that
bit
of
småland
which
lies
south
of
lake
vettern
is
not
to
be
found
in
all
sweden
think
of
the
beautiful
sea
and
the
yellow
and
of
grenna
and
jönköping
with
its
match
factory
and
think
of
huskvarna
and
all
the
big
establishments
there
yes
that
true
enough
said
little
mats
once
again
and
think
of
visingsö
little
mats
with
the
ruins
and
the
oak
forests
and
the
legends
think
of
the
valley
through
which
emån
flows
with
all
the
villages
and
and
sawmills
and
the
carpenter
shops
yes
that
is
true
enough
said
little
mats
and
looked
troubled
all
of
a
sudden
he
had
looked
up
now
we
are
pretty
stupid
said
he
all
this
of
course
lies
in
our
lord
småland
in
that
part
of
the
land
which
was
already
finished
when
saint
peter
undertook
the
job
only
natural
that
it
should
be
pretty
and
fine
there
but
in
saint
peter
småland
it
looks
as
it
says
in
the
legend
and
it
surprising
that
our
lord
was
distressed
when
he
saw
it
continued
little
mats
as
he
took
up
the
thread
of
his
story
again
saint
peter
did
lose
his
courage
at
all
events
but
tried
to
comfort
our
lord
be
so
grieved
over
this
said
he
wait
until
i
have
created
people
who
can
till
the
swamps
and
break
up
fields
from
the
stone
hills
that
was
the
end
of
our
lord
patience
and
he
said
you
can
go
down
to
skåne
and
make
the
skåninge
but
the
smålander
i
will
create
myself
and
so
our
lord
created
the
smålander
and
made
him
and
contented
and
happy
and
thrifty
and
enterprising
and
capable
that
he
might
be
able
to
get
his
livelihood
in
his
poor
country
then
little
mats
was
silent
and
if
nils
holgersson
had
also
kept
still
all
would
have
gone
well
but
he
could
possibly
refrain
from
asking
how
saint
peter
had
succeeded
in
creating
the
skåninge
well
what
do
you
think
yourself
said
little
mats
and
looked
so
scornful
that
nils
holgersson
threw
himself
upon
him
to
thrash
him
but
mats
was
only
a
little
tot
and
osa
the
who
was
a
year
older
than
he
ran
forward
instantly
to
help
him
though
she
was
she
sprang
like
a
lion
as
soon
as
anyone
touched
her
brother
and
nils
holgersson
did
not
care
to
fight
a
girl
but
turned
his
back
and
did
look
at
those
småland
children
for
the
rest
of
the
day
the
crows
the
earthen
crock
in
the
southwest
corner
of
småland
lies
a
township
called
sonnerbo
it
is
a
rather
smooth
and
even
country
and
one
who
sees
it
in
winter
when
it
is
covered
with
snow
can
not
imagine
that
there
is
anything
under
the
snow
but
and
as
is
generally
the
case
in
flat
countries
but
in
the
beginning
of
april
when
the
snow
finally
melts
away
in
sonnerbo
it
is
apparent
that
that
which
lies
hidden
under
it
is
only
dry
sandy
heaths
bare
rocks
and
big
marshy
swamps
there
are
fields
here
and
there
to
be
sure
but
they
are
so
small
that
they
are
scarcely
worth
mentioning
and
one
also
finds
a
few
little
red
or
gray
farmhouses
hidden
away
in
some
almost
as
if
they
were
afraid
to
show
themselves
where
sonnerbo
township
touches
the
boundaries
of
halland
there
is
a
sandy
heath
which
is
so
that
he
who
stands
upon
one
edge
of
it
can
not
look
across
to
the
other
nothing
except
heather
grows
on
the
heath
and
it
would
be
easy
either
to
coax
other
growths
to
thrive
there
to
start
with
one
would
have
to
uproot
the
heather
for
it
is
thus
with
heather
although
it
has
only
a
little
shrunken
root
small
shrunken
branches
and
dry
shrunken
leaves
it
fancies
that
it
a
tree
therefore
it
acts
just
like
real
trees
spreads
itself
out
in
forest
fashion
over
wide
areas
holds
together
faithfully
and
causes
all
foreign
growths
that
wish
to
crowd
in
upon
its
territory
to
die
out
the
only
place
on
the
heath
where
the
heather
is
not
is
a
low
stony
ridge
which
passes
over
it
there
you
find
juniper
bushes
mountain
ash
and
a
few
large
fine
oaks
at
the
time
when
nils
holgersson
travelled
around
with
the
wild
geese
a
little
cabin
stood
there
with
a
bit
of
cleared
ground
around
it
but
the
people
who
had
lived
there
at
one
time
had
for
some
reason
or
other
moved
away
the
little
cabin
was
empty
and
the
ground
lay
unused
when
the
tenants
left
the
cabin
they
closed
the
damper
fastened
the
and
locked
the
door
but
no
one
had
thought
of
the
broken
which
was
only
stuffed
with
a
rag
after
the
showers
of
a
couple
of
summers
the
rag
had
moulded
and
shrunk
and
finally
a
crow
had
succeeded
in
poking
it
out
the
ridge
on
the
was
really
not
as
desolate
as
one
might
think
for
it
was
inhabited
by
a
large
naturally
the
crows
did
not
live
there
all
the
year
round
they
moved
to
foreign
lands
in
the
winter
in
the
autumn
they
travelled
from
one
to
another
all
over
götaland
and
picked
grain
during
the
summer
they
spread
themselves
over
the
farms
in
sonnerbo
township
and
lived
upon
eggs
and
berries
and
birdlings
but
every
spring
when
nesting
time
came
they
came
back
to
the
the
one
who
had
poked
the
rag
from
the
window
was
a
named
garm
whitefeather
but
he
was
never
called
anything
but
fumle
or
drumle
or
out
and
out
because
he
always
acted
awkwardly
and
stupidly
and
was
good
for
anything
except
to
make
fun
of
was
bigger
and
stronger
than
any
of
the
other
crows
but
that
did
help
him
in
the
least
he
was
and
remained
a
butt
for
ridicule
and
it
did
profit
him
either
that
he
came
from
very
good
stock
if
everything
had
gone
smoothly
he
should
have
been
leader
for
the
whole
flock
because
this
honour
had
from
time
immemorial
belonged
to
the
oldest
whitefeather
but
long
before
was
born
the
power
had
gone
from
his
family
and
was
now
wielded
by
a
cruel
wild
crow
named
this
transference
of
power
was
due
to
the
fact
that
the
crows
on
desired
to
change
their
manner
of
living
possibly
there
are
many
who
think
that
everything
in
the
shape
of
crow
lives
in
the
same
way
but
this
is
not
so
there
are
entire
who
lead
honourable
lives
that
is
to
say
they
only
eat
grain
worms
caterpillars
and
dead
animals
and
there
are
others
who
lead
a
regular
bandit
life
who
throw
themselves
upon
and
small
birds
and
plunder
every
single
bird
nest
they
set
eyes
on
the
ancient
whitefeathers
had
been
strict
and
temperate
and
as
long
as
they
had
led
the
flock
the
crows
had
been
compelled
to
conduct
themselves
in
such
a
way
that
other
birds
could
speak
no
ill
of
them
but
the
crows
were
numerous
and
poverty
was
great
among
them
they
did
care
to
go
the
whole
length
of
living
a
strictly
moral
life
so
they
rebelled
against
the
whitefeathers
and
gave
the
power
to
who
was
the
worst
and
robber
that
could
be
imagined
if
his
wife
was
worse
still
under
their
government
the
crows
had
begun
to
lead
such
a
life
that
now
they
were
more
feared
than
and
naturally
had
nothing
to
say
in
the
flock
the
crows
were
all
of
the
opinion
that
he
did
not
in
the
least
take
after
his
forefathers
and
that
he
would
suit
as
a
leader
no
one
would
have
mentioned
him
if
he
had
constantly
committed
fresh
blunders
a
few
who
were
quite
sensible
sometimes
said
perhaps
it
was
lucky
for
that
he
was
such
a
bungling
idiot
otherwise
and
would
hardly
have
allowed
him
who
was
of
the
old
chieftain
stock
to
remain
with
the
flock
now
on
the
other
hand
they
were
rather
friendly
toward
him
and
willingly
took
him
along
with
them
on
their
hunting
expeditions
there
all
could
observe
how
much
more
skilful
and
daring
they
were
than
he
none
of
the
crows
knew
that
it
was
who
had
pecked
the
rag
out
of
the
window
and
had
they
known
of
this
they
would
have
been
very
much
astonished
such
a
thing
as
daring
to
approach
a
human
dwelling
they
had
never
believed
of
him
he
kept
the
thing
to
himself
very
carefully
and
he
had
his
own
good
reasons
for
it
always
treated
him
well
in
the
daytime
and
when
the
others
were
around
but
one
very
dark
night
when
the
comrades
sat
on
the
night
branch
he
was
attacked
by
a
couple
of
crows
and
nearly
murdered
after
that
he
moved
every
night
after
dark
from
his
usual
sleeping
quarters
into
the
empty
cabin
now
one
afternoon
when
the
crows
had
put
their
nests
in
order
on
they
happened
upon
a
remarkable
find
and
a
couple
of
others
had
flown
down
into
a
big
hollow
in
one
corner
of
the
heath
the
hollow
was
nothing
but
a
but
the
crows
could
not
be
satisfied
with
such
a
simple
explanation
they
flew
down
in
it
continually
and
turned
every
single
to
get
at
the
reason
why
human
beings
had
digged
it
while
the
crows
were
pottering
around
down
there
a
mass
of
gravel
fell
from
one
side
they
rushed
up
to
it
and
had
the
good
fortune
to
find
amongst
the
fallen
stones
and
stubble
a
large
earthen
crock
which
was
locked
with
a
wooden
clasp
naturally
they
wanted
to
know
if
there
was
anything
in
it
and
they
tried
both
to
peck
holes
in
the
crock
and
to
bend
up
the
clasp
but
they
had
no
success
they
stood
perfectly
helpless
and
examined
the
crock
when
they
heard
someone
say
shall
i
come
down
and
assist
you
crows
they
glanced
up
quickly
on
the
edge
of
the
hollow
sat
a
fox
and
blinked
down
at
them
he
was
one
of
the
prettiest
foxes
both
in
colour
and
form
that
they
had
ever
seen
the
only
fault
with
him
was
that
he
had
lost
an
ear
if
you
desire
to
do
us
a
service
said
we
shall
not
say
nay
at
the
same
time
both
he
and
the
others
flew
up
from
the
hollow
then
the
fox
jumped
down
in
their
place
bit
at
the
jar
and
pulled
at
the
lock
but
he
could
open
it
either
can
you
make
out
what
there
is
in
it
said
the
fox
rolled
the
jar
back
and
forth
and
listened
attentively
it
must
be
silver
money
said
he
this
was
more
than
the
crows
had
expected
do
you
think
it
can
be
silver
said
they
and
their
eyes
were
ready
to
pop
out
of
their
heads
with
greed
for
remarkable
as
it
may
sound
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
which
crows
love
as
much
as
silver
money
hear
how
it
rattles
said
the
fox
and
rolled
the
crock
around
once
more
only
i
ca
understand
how
we
shall
get
at
it
that
will
surely
be
impossible
said
the
crows
the
fox
stood
and
rubbed
his
head
against
his
left
leg
and
pondered
now
perhaps
he
might
succeed
with
the
help
of
the
crows
in
becoming
master
of
that
little
imp
who
always
eluded
him
oh
i
know
someone
who
could
open
the
crock
for
you
said
the
fox
then
tell
us
tell
us
cried
the
crows
and
they
were
so
excited
that
they
tumbled
down
into
the
pit
that
i
will
do
if
first
promise
me
that
you
will
agree
to
my
terms
said
he
then
the
fox
told
the
crows
about
thumbietot
and
said
that
if
they
could
bring
him
to
the
heath
he
would
open
the
crock
for
them
but
in
payment
for
this
counsel
he
demanded
that
they
should
deliver
thumbietot
to
him
as
soon
as
he
had
gotten
the
silver
money
for
them
the
crows
had
no
reason
to
spare
thumbietot
so
agreed
to
the
compact
at
once
it
was
easy
enough
to
agree
to
this
but
it
was
harder
to
find
out
where
thumbietot
and
the
wild
geese
were
stopping
himself
travelled
away
with
fifty
crows
and
said
that
he
should
soon
return
but
one
day
after
another
passed
without
the
crows
on
seeing
a
shadow
of
him
kidnapped
by
crows
april
the
wild
geese
were
up
at
daybreak
so
they
should
have
time
to
get
themselves
a
bite
of
food
before
starting
out
on
the
journey
toward
östergötland
the
island
in
goosefiord
where
they
had
slept
was
small
and
barren
but
in
the
water
all
around
it
were
growths
which
they
could
eat
their
fill
upon
it
was
worse
for
the
boy
however
he
manage
to
find
anything
eatable
as
he
stood
there
hungry
and
drowsy
and
looked
around
in
all
directions
his
glance
fell
upon
a
pair
of
squirrels
who
played
upon
the
wooded
point
directly
opposite
the
rock
island
he
wondered
if
the
squirrels
still
had
any
of
their
winter
supplies
left
and
asked
the
white
to
take
him
over
to
the
point
that
he
might
beg
them
for
a
couple
of
hazelnuts
instantly
the
white
one
swam
across
the
sound
with
him
but
as
luck
would
have
it
the
squirrels
had
so
much
fun
chasing
each
other
from
tree
to
tree
that
they
did
bother
about
listening
to
the
boy
they
drew
farther
into
the
grove
he
hurried
after
them
and
was
soon
out
of
the
sight
who
stayed
behind
and
waited
on
the
shore
the
boy
waded
forward
between
some
white
which
were
so
high
they
reached
to
his
chin
when
he
felt
that
someone
caught
hold
of
him
from
behind
and
tried
to
lift
him
up
he
turned
round
and
saw
that
a
crow
had
grabbed
him
by
the
he
tried
to
break
loose
but
before
this
was
possible
another
crow
ran
up
gripped
him
by
the
stocking
and
knocked
him
over
if
nils
holgersson
had
immediately
cried
for
help
the
white
certainly
would
have
been
able
to
save
him
but
the
boy
probably
thought
that
he
could
protect
himself
unaided
against
a
couple
of
crows
he
kicked
and
struck
out
but
the
crows
did
let
go
their
hold
and
they
soon
succeeded
in
raising
themselves
into
the
air
with
him
to
make
matters
worse
they
flew
so
recklessly
that
his
head
struck
against
a
branch
he
received
a
hard
knock
over
the
head
it
grew
black
before
his
eyes
and
he
lost
consciousness
when
he
opened
his
eyes
once
more
he
found
himself
high
above
the
ground
he
regained
his
senses
slowly
at
first
he
knew
neither
where
he
was
nor
what
he
saw
when
he
glanced
down
he
saw
that
under
him
was
spread
a
tremendously
big
woolly
carpet
which
was
woven
in
greens
and
reds
and
in
large
irregular
patterns
the
carpet
was
very
thick
and
fine
but
he
thought
it
was
a
pity
that
it
had
been
so
badly
used
it
was
actually
ragged
long
tears
ran
through
it
in
some
places
large
pieces
were
torn
away
and
the
strangest
of
all
was
that
it
appeared
to
be
spread
over
a
mirror
floor
for
under
the
holes
and
tears
in
the
carpet
shone
bright
and
glittering
glass
the
next
thing
the
boy
observed
was
that
the
sun
unrolled
itself
in
the
heavens
instantly
the
under
the
holes
and
tears
in
the
carpet
began
to
shimmer
in
red
and
gold
it
looked
very
gorgeous
and
the
boy
was
delighted
with
the
pretty
although
he
exactly
understand
what
it
was
that
he
saw
but
now
the
crows
descended
and
he
saw
at
once
that
the
big
carpet
under
him
was
the
earth
which
was
dressed
in
green
and
brown
and
naked
and
that
the
holes
and
tears
were
shining
fiords
and
little
lakes
he
remembered
that
the
first
time
he
had
travelled
up
in
the
air
he
had
thought
that
the
earth
in
skåne
looked
like
a
piece
of
checked
cloth
but
this
country
which
resembled
a
torn
carpet
what
might
this
be
he
began
to
ask
himself
a
lot
of
questions
why
was
he
sitting
on
the
back
why
did
a
great
swarm
of
crows
fly
around
him
and
why
was
he
being
pulled
and
knocked
hither
and
thither
so
that
he
was
about
to
break
to
pieces
then
all
at
once
the
whole
thing
dawned
on
him
he
had
been
kidnapped
by
a
couple
of
crows
the
white
was
still
on
the
shore
waiting
and
the
wild
geese
were
going
to
travel
to
östergötland
he
was
being
carried
southwest
this
he
understood
because
the
disc
was
behind
him
the
big
which
lay
beneath
him
was
surely
småland
what
will
become
of
the
now
when
i
can
not
look
after
him
thought
the
boy
and
began
to
call
to
the
crows
to
take
him
back
to
the
wild
geese
instantly
he
was
at
all
uneasy
on
his
own
account
he
believed
that
they
were
carrying
him
off
simply
in
a
spirit
of
mischief
the
crows
did
pay
the
slightest
attention
to
his
exhortations
but
flew
on
as
fast
as
they
could
after
a
bit
one
of
them
flapped
his
wings
in
a
manner
which
meant
look
out
danger
soon
thereafter
they
came
down
in
a
spruce
forest
pushed
their
way
between
prickly
branches
to
the
ground
and
put
the
boy
down
under
a
thick
spruce
where
he
was
so
well
concealed
that
not
even
a
falcon
could
have
sighted
him
fifty
crows
surrounded
him
with
bills
pointed
toward
him
to
guard
him
now
perhaps
i
may
hear
crows
what
your
purpose
is
in
carrying
me
off
said
he
but
he
was
hardly
permitted
to
finish
the
sentence
before
a
big
crow
hissed
at
him
keep
still
or
i
bore
your
eyes
out
it
was
evident
that
the
crow
meant
what
she
said
and
there
was
nothing
for
the
boy
to
do
but
obey
so
he
sat
there
and
stared
at
the
crows
and
the
crows
stared
at
him
the
longer
he
looked
at
them
the
less
he
liked
them
it
was
dreadful
how
dusty
and
unkempt
their
feather
dresses
were
as
though
they
knew
neither
baths
nor
oiling
their
toes
and
claws
were
grimy
with
mud
and
the
corners
of
their
mouths
were
covered
with
food
drippings
these
were
very
different
birds
from
the
wild
geese
that
he
observed
he
thought
they
had
a
cruel
sneaky
watchful
and
bold
appearance
just
like
and
vagabonds
it
is
certainly
a
real
that
i
fallen
in
with
thought
he
just
then
he
heard
the
wild
geese
call
above
him
where
are
you
here
am
i
where
are
you
here
am
i
he
understood
that
akka
and
the
others
had
gone
out
to
search
for
him
but
before
he
could
answer
them
the
big
crow
who
appeared
to
be
the
leader
of
the
band
hissed
in
his
ear
think
of
your
eyes
and
there
was
nothing
else
for
him
to
do
but
to
keep
still
the
wild
geese
may
not
have
known
that
he
was
so
near
them
but
had
just
happened
incidentally
to
travel
over
this
forest
he
heard
their
call
a
couple
of
times
more
then
it
died
away
well
now
you
have
to
get
along
by
yourself
nils
holgersson
he
said
to
himself
now
you
must
prove
whether
you
have
learned
anything
during
these
weeks
in
the
open
a
moment
later
the
crows
gave
the
signal
to
break
up
and
since
it
was
still
their
intention
apparently
to
carry
him
along
in
such
a
way
that
one
held
on
to
his
and
one
to
a
stocking
the
boy
said
is
there
not
one
among
you
so
strong
that
he
can
carry
me
on
his
back
you
have
already
travelled
so
badly
with
me
that
i
feel
as
if
i
were
in
pieces
only
let
me
ride
i
not
jump
from
the
crow
back
that
i
promise
you
oh
you
need
think
that
we
care
how
you
have
it
said
the
leader
but
now
the
largest
of
the
crows
a
dishevelled
and
uncouth
one
who
had
a
white
feather
in
his
wing
came
forward
and
said
it
would
certainly
be
best
for
all
of
us
if
thumbietot
got
there
whole
rather
than
half
and
therefore
i
shall
carry
him
on
my
back
if
you
can
do
it
i
have
no
objection
said
but
do
lose
him
with
this
much
was
already
gained
and
the
boy
actually
felt
pleased
again
there
is
nothing
to
be
gained
by
losing
my
grit
because
i
have
been
kidnapped
by
the
crows
thought
he
i
surely
be
able
to
manage
those
poor
little
things
the
crows
continued
to
fly
southwest
over
småland
it
was
a
glorious
morning
sunny
and
calm
and
the
birds
down
on
the
earth
were
singing
their
best
love
songs
in
a
high
dark
forest
sat
the
thrush
himself
with
drooping
wings
and
swelling
throat
and
struck
up
tune
after
tune
how
pretty
you
are
how
pretty
you
are
how
pretty
you
are
sang
he
no
one
is
so
pretty
no
one
is
so
pretty
no
one
is
so
pretty
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
this
song
he
began
it
all
over
again
but
just
then
the
boy
rode
over
the
forest
and
when
he
had
heard
the
song
a
couple
of
times
and
marked
that
the
thrush
knew
no
other
he
put
both
hands
up
to
his
mouth
as
a
speaking
trumpet
and
called
down
we
heard
all
this
before
we
heard
all
this
before
who
is
it
who
is
it
who
is
it
who
makes
fun
of
me
asked
the
thrush
and
tried
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
one
who
called
it
is
who
makes
fun
of
your
song
answered
the
boy
at
that
the
turned
his
head
and
said
be
careful
of
your
eyes
thumbietot
but
the
boy
thought
oh
i
do
care
about
that
i
want
to
show
you
that
not
afraid
of
you
farther
and
farther
inland
they
travelled
and
there
were
woods
and
lakes
everywhere
in
a
sat
the
on
a
naked
branch
and
before
him
stood
the
he
blew
up
his
feathers
cocked
his
head
raised
and
lowered
his
body
until
the
rattled
against
the
branch
all
the
while
he
cooed
thou
thou
thou
art
the
loveliest
in
all
the
forest
no
one
in
the
forest
is
so
lovely
as
thou
thou
thou
but
up
in
the
air
the
boy
rode
past
and
when
he
heard
dove
he
could
keep
still
do
you
believe
him
do
you
believe
him
cried
he
who
who
who
is
it
that
lies
about
me
cooed
dove
and
tried
to
get
a
sight
of
the
one
who
shrieked
at
him
it
is
that
lies
about
you
replied
the
boy
again
turned
his
head
toward
the
boy
and
commanded
him
to
shut
up
but
who
was
carrying
him
said
let
him
chatter
then
all
the
little
birds
will
think
that
we
crows
have
become
and
funny
birds
oh
they
not
such
fools
either
said
but
he
liked
the
idea
just
the
same
for
after
that
he
let
the
boy
call
out
as
much
as
he
liked
they
flew
mostly
over
forests
and
woodlands
but
there
were
churches
and
parishes
and
little
cabins
in
the
outskirts
of
the
forest
in
one
place
they
saw
a
pretty
old
manor
it
lay
with
the
forest
back
of
it
and
the
sea
in
front
of
it
had
red
walls
and
a
turreted
roof
great
sycamores
about
the
grounds
and
big
thick
in
the
orchard
on
the
top
of
the
weathercock
sat
the
starling
and
sang
so
loud
that
every
note
was
heard
by
the
wife
who
sat
on
an
egg
in
the
heart
of
a
pear
tree
we
have
four
pretty
little
eggs
sang
the
starling
we
have
four
pretty
little
round
eggs
we
have
the
whole
nest
filled
with
fine
eggs
when
the
starling
sang
the
song
for
the
thousandth
time
the
boy
rode
over
the
place
he
put
his
hands
up
to
his
mouth
as
a
pipe
and
called
the
magpie
will
get
them
the
magpie
will
get
them
who
is
it
that
wants
to
frighten
me
asked
the
starling
and
flapped
his
wings
uneasily
it
is
that
frightens
you
said
the
boy
this
time
the
did
attempt
to
hush
him
up
instead
both
he
and
his
flock
were
having
so
much
fun
that
they
cawed
with
satisfaction
the
farther
inland
they
came
the
larger
were
the
lakes
and
the
more
plentiful
were
the
islands
and
points
and
on
a
stood
a
drake
and
kowtowed
before
the
duck
i
be
true
to
you
all
the
days
of
my
life
i
be
true
to
you
all
the
days
of
my
life
said
the
drake
it
wo
last
until
the
summer
end
shrieked
the
boy
who
are
you
called
the
drake
my
name
shrieked
the
boy
at
dinner
time
the
crows
lighted
in
a
they
walked
about
and
procured
food
for
themselves
but
none
of
them
thought
about
giving
the
boy
anything
then
came
riding
up
to
the
chief
with
a
branch
with
a
few
dried
buds
on
it
here
something
for
you
said
he
this
is
pretty
food
and
suitable
for
you
sniffed
contemptuously
do
you
think
that
i
want
to
eat
old
dry
buds
said
he
and
i
who
thought
that
you
would
be
pleased
with
them
said
and
threw
away
the
branch
as
if
in
despair
but
it
fell
right
in
front
of
the
boy
and
he
was
slow
about
grabbing
it
and
eating
until
he
was
satisfied
when
the
crows
had
eaten
they
began
to
chatter
what
are
you
thinking
about
you
are
so
quiet
said
one
of
them
to
the
leader
i
thinking
that
in
this
district
there
lived
once
upon
a
time
a
hen
who
was
very
fond
of
her
mistress
and
in
order
to
really
please
her
she
went
and
laid
a
nest
full
of
eggs
which
she
hid
under
the
floor
the
mistress
of
the
house
wondered
of
course
where
the
hen
was
keeping
herself
such
a
long
time
she
searched
for
her
but
did
not
find
her
can
you
guess
longbill
who
it
was
that
found
her
and
the
eggs
i
think
i
can
guess
it
but
when
you
have
told
about
this
i
will
tell
you
something
like
it
do
you
remember
the
big
black
cat
in
hinneryd
parish
house
she
was
dissatisfied
because
they
always
took
the
kittens
from
her
and
drowned
them
just
once
did
she
succeed
in
keeping
them
concealed
and
that
was
when
she
had
laid
them
in
a
haystack
out
doors
she
was
pretty
well
pleased
with
those
young
kittens
but
i
believe
that
i
got
more
pleasure
out
of
them
than
she
did
now
they
became
so
excited
that
they
all
talked
at
once
what
kind
of
an
accomplishment
is
that
to
steal
little
kittens
said
one
i
once
chased
a
young
hare
who
was
almost
that
meant
to
follow
him
from
covert
to
covert
he
got
no
further
before
another
took
the
words
from
him
it
may
be
fun
perhaps
to
annoy
hens
and
cats
but
i
find
it
still
more
remarkable
that
a
crow
can
worry
a
human
being
i
once
stole
a
silver
spoon
but
now
the
boy
thought
he
was
too
good
to
sit
and
listen
to
such
gabble
now
listen
to
me
you
crows
said
he
i
think
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourselves
to
talk
about
all
your
wickedness
i
have
lived
amongst
wild
geese
for
three
weeks
and
of
them
i
have
never
heard
or
seen
anything
but
good
you
must
have
a
bad
chief
since
he
permits
you
to
rob
and
murder
in
this
way
you
ought
to
begin
to
lead
new
lives
for
i
can
tell
you
that
human
beings
have
grown
so
tired
of
your
wickedness
they
are
trying
with
all
their
might
to
root
you
out
and
then
there
will
soon
be
an
end
of
you
when
and
the
crows
heard
this
they
were
so
furious
that
they
intended
to
throw
themselves
upon
him
and
tear
him
in
pieces
but
laughed
and
cawed
and
stood
in
front
of
him
oh
no
no
said
he
and
seemed
absolutely
terrified
what
think
you
that
will
say
if
you
tear
thumbietot
in
pieces
before
he
has
gotten
that
silver
money
for
us
it
has
to
be
you
that
afraid
of
said
rush
but
at
any
rate
both
he
and
the
others
left
thumbietot
in
peace
shortly
after
that
the
crows
went
further
until
now
the
boy
thought
that
småland
was
such
a
poor
country
as
he
had
heard
of
course
it
was
woody
and
full
of
but
alongside
the
islands
and
lakes
lay
cultivated
grounds
and
any
real
desolation
he
had
come
upon
but
the
farther
inland
they
came
the
fewer
were
the
villages
and
cottages
toward
the
last
he
thought
that
he
was
riding
over
a
veritable
wilderness
where
he
saw
nothing
but
swamps
and
heaths
and
the
sun
had
gone
down
but
it
was
still
perfect
daylight
when
the
crows
reached
the
large
sent
a
crow
on
ahead
to
say
that
he
had
met
with
success
and
when
it
was
known
with
several
hundred
crows
from
flew
to
meet
the
arrivals
in
the
midst
of
the
deafening
cawing
which
the
crows
emitted
said
to
the
boy
you
have
been
so
comical
and
so
jolly
during
the
trip
that
i
am
really
fond
of
you
therefore
i
want
to
give
you
some
good
advice
as
soon
as
we
light
you
be
requested
to
do
a
bit
of
work
which
may
seem
very
easy
to
you
but
beware
of
doing
it
soon
thereafter
put
nils
holgersson
down
in
the
bottom
of
a
sandpit
the
boy
flung
himself
down
rolled
over
and
lay
there
as
though
he
was
simply
done
up
with
fatigue
such
a
lot
of
crows
fluttered
about
him
that
the
air
rustled
like
a
but
he
did
look
up
thumbietot
said
get
up
now
you
shall
help
us
with
a
matter
which
will
be
very
easy
for
you
the
boy
did
move
but
pretended
to
be
asleep
then
took
him
by
the
arm
and
dragged
him
over
the
sand
to
an
earthen
crock
of
make
that
was
standing
in
the
pit
get
up
thumbietot
said
he
and
open
this
crock
why
ca
you
let
me
sleep
said
the
boy
i
too
tired
to
do
anything
wait
until
open
the
crock
said
shaking
him
how
shall
a
poor
little
child
be
able
to
open
such
a
crock
why
it
quite
as
large
as
i
am
myself
open
it
commanded
once
more
or
it
will
be
a
sorry
thing
for
you
the
boy
got
up
tottered
over
to
the
crock
fumbled
the
clasp
and
let
his
arms
fall
i
not
usually
so
weak
said
he
if
you
will
only
let
me
sleep
until
morning
i
think
that
be
able
to
manage
with
that
clasp
but
was
impatient
and
he
rushed
forward
and
pinched
the
boy
in
the
leg
that
sort
of
treatment
the
boy
did
care
to
suffer
from
a
crow
he
jerked
himself
loose
quickly
ran
a
couple
of
paces
backward
drew
his
knife
from
the
sheath
and
held
it
extended
in
front
of
him
you
better
be
careful
he
cried
to
this
one
too
was
so
enraged
that
he
did
dodge
the
danger
he
rushed
at
the
boy
just
as
though
he
been
blind
and
ran
so
straight
against
the
knife
that
it
entered
through
his
eye
into
the
head
the
boy
drew
the
knife
back
quickly
but
only
struck
out
with
his
wings
then
he
fell
down
dead
is
dead
the
stranger
has
killed
our
chieftain
cried
the
nearest
crows
and
then
there
was
a
terrible
uproar
some
wailed
others
cried
for
vengeance
they
all
ran
or
fluttered
up
to
the
boy
with
in
the
lead
but
he
acted
badly
as
usual
he
only
fluttered
and
spread
his
wings
over
the
boy
and
prevented
the
others
from
coming
forward
and
running
their
bills
into
him
the
boy
thought
that
things
looked
very
bad
for
him
now
he
could
run
away
from
the
crows
and
there
was
no
place
where
he
could
hide
then
he
happened
to
think
of
the
earthen
crock
he
took
a
firm
hold
on
the
clasp
and
pulled
it
off
then
he
hopped
into
the
crock
to
hide
in
it
but
the
crock
was
a
poor
hiding
place
for
it
was
nearly
filled
to
the
brim
with
little
thin
silver
coins
the
boy
could
get
far
enough
down
so
he
stooped
and
began
to
throw
out
the
coins
until
now
the
crows
had
fluttered
around
him
in
a
thick
swarm
and
pecked
at
him
but
when
he
threw
out
the
coins
they
immediately
forgot
their
thirst
for
vengeance
and
hurried
to
gather
the
money
the
boy
threw
out
handfuls
of
it
and
all
the
crows
yes
even
herself
picked
them
up
and
everyone
who
succeeded
in
picking
up
a
coin
ran
off
to
the
nest
with
the
utmost
speed
to
conceal
it
when
the
boy
had
thrown
out
all
the
silver
pennies
from
the
crock
he
glanced
up
not
more
than
a
single
crow
was
left
in
the
sandpit
that
was
with
the
white
feather
in
his
wing
he
who
had
carried
thumbietot
you
have
rendered
me
a
greater
service
than
you
understand
said
the
crow
with
a
very
different
voice
and
a
different
intonation
than
the
one
he
had
used
heretofore
and
i
want
to
save
your
life
sit
down
on
my
back
and
i
take
you
to
a
hiding
place
where
you
can
be
secure
for
i
arrange
it
so
that
you
will
get
back
to
the
wild
geese
the
cabin
april
the
following
morning
when
the
boy
awoke
he
lay
in
a
bed
when
he
saw
that
he
was
in
a
house
with
four
walls
around
him
and
a
roof
over
him
he
thought
that
he
was
at
home
i
wonder
if
mother
will
come
soon
with
some
coffee
he
muttered
to
himself
where
he
lay
then
he
remembered
that
he
was
in
a
deserted
cabin
on
the
and
that
with
the
white
feather
had
borne
him
there
the
night
before
the
boy
was
sore
all
over
after
the
journey
he
had
made
the
day
before
and
he
thought
it
was
lovely
to
lie
still
while
he
waited
for
who
had
promised
to
come
and
fetch
him
curtains
of
checked
cotton
hung
before
the
bed
and
he
drew
them
aside
to
look
out
into
the
cabin
it
dawned
upon
him
instantly
that
he
had
never
seen
the
mate
to
a
cabin
like
this
the
walls
consisted
of
nothing
but
a
couple
of
rows
of
logs
then
the
roof
began
there
was
no
interior
ceiling
so
he
could
look
clear
up
to
the
the
cabin
was
so
small
that
it
appeared
to
have
been
built
rather
for
such
as
he
than
for
real
people
however
the
fireplace
and
chimney
were
so
large
he
thought
that
he
had
never
seen
larger
the
entrance
door
was
in
a
at
the
side
of
the
fireplace
and
was
so
narrow
that
it
was
more
like
a
wicket
than
a
door
in
the
other
he
saw
a
low
and
broad
window
with
many
panes
there
was
scarcely
any
movable
furniture
in
the
cabin
the
bench
on
one
side
and
the
table
under
the
window
were
also
stationary
also
the
big
bed
where
he
lay
and
the
cupboard
the
boy
could
not
help
wondering
who
owned
the
cabin
and
why
it
was
deserted
it
certainly
looked
as
though
the
people
who
had
lived
there
expected
to
return
the
and
the
stood
on
the
hearth
and
there
was
some
wood
in
the
fireplace
the
and
baker
peel
stood
in
a
corner
the
spinning
wheel
was
raised
on
a
bench
on
the
shelf
over
the
window
lay
oakum
and
flax
a
couple
of
skeins
of
yarn
a
candle
and
a
bunch
of
matches
yes
it
surely
looked
as
if
those
who
had
lived
there
had
intended
to
come
back
there
were
on
the
bed
and
on
the
walls
there
still
hung
long
strips
of
cloth
upon
which
three
riders
named
kasper
melchior
and
baltasar
were
painted
the
same
horses
and
riders
were
pictured
many
times
they
rode
around
the
whole
cabin
and
continued
their
ride
even
up
toward
the
joists
but
in
the
roof
the
boy
saw
something
which
brought
him
to
his
senses
in
a
jiffy
it
was
a
couple
of
loaves
of
big
that
hung
there
upon
a
spit
they
looked
old
and
mouldy
but
it
was
bread
all
the
same
he
gave
them
a
knock
with
the
and
one
piece
fell
to
the
floor
he
ate
and
stuffed
his
bag
full
it
was
incredible
how
good
bread
was
anyway
he
looked
around
the
cabin
once
more
to
try
and
discover
if
there
was
anything
else
which
he
might
find
useful
to
take
along
i
may
as
well
take
what
i
need
since
no
one
else
cares
about
it
thought
he
but
most
of
the
things
were
too
big
and
heavy
the
only
things
that
he
could
carry
might
be
a
few
matches
perhaps
he
clambered
up
on
the
table
and
swung
with
the
help
of
the
curtains
up
to
the
while
he
stood
there
and
stuffed
the
matches
into
his
bag
the
crow
with
the
white
feather
came
in
through
the
window
well
here
i
am
at
last
said
as
he
lit
on
the
table
i
could
get
here
any
sooner
because
we
crows
have
elected
a
new
chieftain
in
place
whom
have
you
chosen
said
the
boy
well
we
have
chosen
one
who
will
not
permit
robbery
and
injustice
we
have
elected
garm
whitefeather
lately
called
answered
he
drawing
himself
up
until
he
looked
absolutely
regal
that
was
a
good
choice
said
the
boy
and
congratulated
him
you
may
well
wish
me
luck
said
garm
then
he
told
the
boy
about
the
time
they
had
had
with
and
during
this
recital
the
boy
heard
a
voice
outside
the
window
which
he
thought
sounded
familiar
is
he
here
inquired
the
fox
yes
hidden
in
there
answered
a
be
careful
thumbietot
cried
garm
stands
without
with
that
fox
who
wants
to
eat
you
more
he
did
have
time
to
say
for
smirre
dashed
against
the
window
the
old
rotten
gave
way
and
the
next
second
smirre
stood
upon
the
garm
whitefeather
who
did
have
time
to
fly
away
he
killed
instantly
thereupon
he
jumped
down
to
the
floor
and
looked
around
for
the
boy
he
tried
to
hide
behind
a
big
but
smirre
had
already
spied
him
and
was
crouched
for
the
final
spring
the
cabin
was
so
small
and
so
low
the
boy
understood
that
the
fox
could
reach
him
without
the
least
difficulty
but
just
at
that
moment
the
boy
was
not
without
weapons
of
defence
he
struck
a
match
quickly
touched
the
curtains
and
when
they
were
in
flames
he
threw
them
down
upon
smirre
fox
when
the
fire
enveloped
the
fox
he
was
seized
with
a
mad
terror
he
thought
no
more
about
the
boy
but
rushed
wildly
out
of
the
cabin
but
it
looked
as
if
the
boy
had
escaped
one
danger
to
throw
himself
into
a
greater
one
from
the
tuft
of
oakum
which
he
had
flung
at
smirre
the
fire
had
spread
to
the
he
jumped
down
and
tried
to
smother
it
but
it
blazed
too
quickly
now
the
cabin
was
soon
filled
with
smoke
and
smirre
fox
who
had
remained
just
outside
the
window
began
to
grasp
the
state
of
affairs
within
well
thumbietot
he
called
out
which
do
you
choose
now
to
be
broiled
alive
in
there
or
to
come
out
here
to
me
of
course
i
should
prefer
to
have
the
pleasure
of
eating
you
but
in
whichever
way
death
meets
you
it
will
be
dear
to
me
the
boy
could
not
think
but
what
the
fox
was
right
for
the
fire
was
making
rapid
headway
the
whole
bed
was
now
in
a
blaze
and
smoke
rose
from
the
floor
and
along
the
painted
the
fire
crept
from
rider
to
rider
the
boy
jumped
up
in
the
fireplace
and
tried
to
open
the
oven
door
when
he
heard
a
key
which
turned
around
slowly
in
the
lock
it
must
be
human
beings
coming
and
in
the
dire
extremity
in
which
he
found
himself
he
was
not
afraid
but
only
glad
he
was
already
on
the
threshold
when
the
door
opened
he
saw
a
couple
of
children
facing
him
but
how
they
looked
when
they
saw
the
cabin
in
flames
he
took
no
time
to
find
out
but
rushed
past
them
into
the
open
he
did
dare
run
far
he
knew
of
course
that
smirre
fox
lay
in
wait
for
him
and
he
understood
that
he
must
remain
near
the
children
he
turned
round
to
see
what
sort
of
folk
they
were
but
he
had
looked
at
them
a
second
before
he
ran
up
to
them
and
cried
oh
osa
oh
little
mats
for
when
the
boy
saw
those
children
he
forgot
entirely
where
he
was
crows
and
burning
cabin
and
talking
animals
had
vanished
from
his
memory
he
was
walking
on
a
in
west
vemminghög
tending
a
and
beside
him
on
the
field
walked
those
same
småland
children
with
their
geese
as
soon
as
he
saw
them
he
ran
up
on
the
and
shouted
oh
osa
oh
little
mats
but
when
the
children
saw
such
a
little
creature
coming
up
to
them
with
outstretched
hands
they
grabbed
hold
of
each
other
took
a
couple
of
steps
backward
and
looked
scared
to
death
when
the
boy
noticed
their
terror
he
woke
up
and
remembered
who
he
was
and
then
it
seemed
to
him
that
nothing
worse
could
happen
to
him
than
that
those
children
should
see
how
he
had
been
bewitched
shame
and
grief
because
he
was
no
longer
a
human
being
overpowered
him
he
turned
and
fled
he
knew
not
whither
but
a
glad
meeting
awaited
the
boy
when
he
came
down
to
the
heath
for
there
in
the
heather
he
spied
something
white
and
toward
him
came
the
white
accompanied
by
dunfin
when
the
white
one
saw
the
boy
running
with
such
speed
he
thought
that
dreadful
fiends
were
pursuing
him
he
flung
him
in
all
haste
upon
his
back
and
flew
off
with
him
the
old
peasant
woman
april
three
tired
wanderers
were
out
in
the
late
evening
in
search
of
a
night
harbour
they
travelled
over
a
poor
and
desolate
portion
of
northern
småland
but
the
sort
of
resting
place
which
they
wanted
they
should
have
been
able
to
find
for
they
were
no
weaklings
who
asked
for
soft
beds
or
comfortable
rooms
if
one
of
these
long
had
a
peak
so
high
and
steep
that
a
fox
could
in
any
way
climb
up
to
it
then
we
should
have
a
good
said
one
of
them
if
a
single
one
of
the
big
swamps
was
thawed
out
and
was
so
marshy
and
wet
that
a
fox
would
dare
venture
out
on
it
this
too
would
be
a
right
good
night
harbour
said
the
second
if
the
ice
on
one
of
the
large
lakes
we
travel
past
were
loose
so
that
a
fox
could
not
come
out
on
it
then
we
should
have
found
just
what
we
are
seeking
said
the
third
the
worst
of
it
was
that
when
the
sun
had
gone
down
two
of
the
travellers
became
so
sleepy
that
every
second
they
were
ready
to
fall
to
the
ground
the
third
one
who
could
keep
himself
awake
grew
more
and
more
uneasy
as
night
approached
then
it
was
a
misfortune
that
we
came
to
a
land
where
lakes
and
swamps
are
frozen
so
that
a
fox
can
get
around
everywhere
in
other
places
the
ice
has
melted
away
but
now
we
well
up
in
the
very
coldest
småland
where
spring
has
not
as
yet
arrived
i
do
know
how
i
shall
ever
manage
to
find
a
good
unless
i
find
some
spot
that
is
well
protected
smirre
fox
will
be
upon
us
before
morning
he
gazed
in
all
directions
but
he
saw
no
shelter
where
he
could
lodge
it
was
a
dark
and
chilly
night
with
wind
and
drizzle
it
grew
more
terrible
and
disagreeable
around
him
every
second
this
may
sound
strange
perhaps
but
the
travellers
did
seem
to
have
the
least
desire
to
ask
for
on
any
farm
they
had
already
passed
many
parishes
without
knocking
at
a
single
door
little
hillside
cabins
on
the
outskirts
of
the
forests
which
all
poor
wanderers
are
glad
to
run
across
they
took
no
notice
of
either
one
might
almost
be
tempted
to
say
they
deserved
to
have
a
hard
time
of
it
since
they
did
not
seek
help
where
it
was
to
be
had
for
the
asking
but
finally
when
it
was
so
dark
that
there
was
scarcely
a
glimmer
of
light
left
under
the
skies
and
the
two
who
needed
sleep
journeyed
on
in
a
kind
of
they
happened
into
a
farmyard
which
was
a
long
way
off
from
all
neighbours
and
not
only
did
it
lie
there
desolate
but
it
appeared
to
be
uninhabited
as
well
no
smoke
rose
from
the
chimney
no
light
shone
through
the
windows
no
human
being
moved
on
the
place
when
the
one
among
the
three
who
could
keep
awake
saw
the
place
he
thought
now
come
what
may
we
must
try
to
get
in
here
anything
better
we
are
not
likely
to
find
soon
after
that
all
three
stood
in
the
two
of
them
fell
asleep
the
instant
they
stood
still
but
the
third
looked
about
him
eagerly
to
find
where
they
could
get
under
cover
it
was
not
a
small
farm
beside
the
dwelling
house
and
stable
and
there
were
long
ranges
with
granaries
and
storehouses
and
cattlesheds
but
it
all
looked
awfully
poor
and
dilapidated
the
houses
had
gray
leaning
walls
which
seemed
ready
to
topple
over
in
the
roofs
were
yawning
holes
and
the
doors
hung
aslant
on
broken
hinges
it
was
apparent
that
no
one
had
taken
the
trouble
to
drive
a
nail
into
a
wall
on
this
place
for
a
long
time
meanwhile
he
who
was
awake
had
figured
out
which
house
was
the
cowshed
he
roused
his
travelling
companions
from
their
sleep
and
conducted
them
to
the
cowshed
door
luckily
this
was
not
fastened
with
anything
but
a
hook
which
he
could
easily
push
up
with
a
rod
he
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
at
the
thought
that
they
should
soon
be
in
safety
but
when
the
cowshed
door
swung
open
with
a
sharp
creaking
he
heard
a
cow
begin
to
bellow
are
you
coming
at
last
mistress
said
she
i
thought
that
you
did
propose
to
give
me
any
supper
the
one
who
was
awake
stopped
in
the
doorway
absolutely
terrified
when
he
discovered
that
the
cowshed
was
not
empty
but
he
soon
saw
that
there
was
not
more
than
one
cow
and
three
or
four
chickens
and
then
he
took
courage
again
we
are
three
poor
travellers
who
want
to
come
in
somewhere
where
no
fox
can
assail
us
and
no
human
being
capture
us
said
he
we
wonder
if
this
can
be
a
good
place
for
us
i
can
not
believe
but
what
it
is
answered
the
cow
to
be
sure
the
walls
are
poor
but
the
fox
does
not
walk
through
them
as
yet
and
no
one
lives
here
except
an
old
peasant
woman
who
is
at
all
likely
to
make
a
captive
of
anyone
but
who
are
you
she
continued
as
she
twisted
in
her
stall
to
get
a
sight
of
the
newcomers
i
am
nils
holgersson
from
vemminghög
who
has
been
transformed
into
an
elf
replied
the
first
of
the
incomers
and
i
have
with
me
a
tame
goose
whom
i
generally
ride
and
a
gray
goose
such
rare
guests
have
never
before
been
within
my
four
walls
said
the
cow
and
you
shall
be
welcome
although
i
would
have
preferred
that
it
had
been
my
mistress
come
to
give
me
my
supper
the
boy
led
the
geese
into
the
cowshed
which
was
rather
large
and
placed
them
in
an
empty
manger
where
they
fell
asleep
instantly
for
himself
he
made
a
little
bed
of
straw
and
expected
that
he
too
should
go
to
sleep
at
once
but
this
was
impossible
for
the
poor
cow
who
had
had
her
supper
was
still
an
instant
she
shook
her
flanks
moved
around
in
the
stall
and
complained
of
how
hungry
she
was
the
boy
could
get
a
wink
of
sleep
but
lay
there
and
lived
over
all
the
things
that
had
happened
to
him
during
these
last
days
he
thought
of
osa
the
and
little
mats
whom
he
had
encountered
so
unexpectedly
and
he
fancied
that
the
little
cabin
which
he
had
set
on
fire
must
have
been
their
old
home
in
småland
now
he
recalled
that
he
had
heard
them
speak
of
just
such
a
cabin
and
of
the
big
which
lay
below
it
now
osa
and
mats
had
wandered
back
there
to
see
their
old
home
again
and
then
when
they
had
reached
it
it
was
in
flames
it
was
indeed
a
great
sorrow
which
he
had
brought
upon
them
and
it
hurt
him
very
much
if
he
ever
again
became
a
human
being
he
would
try
to
compensate
them
for
the
damage
and
miscalculation
then
his
thoughts
wandered
to
the
crows
and
when
he
thought
of
who
had
saved
his
life
and
had
met
his
own
death
so
soon
after
he
had
been
elected
chieftain
he
was
so
distressed
that
tears
filled
his
eyes
he
had
had
a
pretty
rough
time
of
it
these
last
few
days
but
anyway
it
was
a
rare
stroke
of
luck
that
the
and
dunfin
had
found
him
the
had
said
that
as
soon
as
the
geese
discovered
that
thumbietot
had
disappeared
they
had
asked
all
the
small
animals
in
the
forest
about
him
they
soon
learned
that
a
flock
of
småland
crows
had
carried
him
off
but
the
crows
were
already
out
of
sight
and
whither
they
had
directed
their
course
no
one
had
been
able
to
say
that
they
might
find
the
boy
as
soon
as
possible
akka
had
commanded
the
wild
geese
to
start
out
two
and
two
in
different
directions
to
search
for
him
but
after
a
two
days
hunt
whether
or
not
they
had
found
him
they
were
to
meet
in
northwestern
småland
on
a
high
which
resembled
an
abrupt
tower
and
was
called
taberg
after
akka
had
given
them
the
best
directions
and
described
carefully
how
they
should
find
taberg
they
had
separated
the
white
had
chosen
dunfin
as
travelling
companion
and
they
had
flown
about
hither
and
thither
with
the
greatest
anxiety
for
thumbietot
during
this
ramble
they
had
heard
a
thrush
who
sat
in
a
cry
and
wail
that
someone
who
called
himself
had
made
fun
of
him
they
had
talked
with
the
thrush
and
he
had
shown
them
in
which
direction
that
had
travelled
afterward
they
had
met
a
a
starling
and
a
drake
they
had
all
wailed
about
a
little
culprit
who
had
disturbed
their
song
and
who
was
named
and
in
this
way
they
were
enabled
to
trace
thumbietot
all
the
way
to
the
in
sonnerbo
township
as
soon
as
the
and
dunfin
had
found
thumbietot
they
had
started
toward
the
north
in
order
to
reach
taberg
but
it
had
been
a
long
road
to
travel
and
the
darkness
was
upon
them
before
they
had
sighted
the
mountain
top
if
we
only
get
there
by
surely
all
our
troubles
will
be
over
thought
the
boy
and
dug
down
into
the
straw
to
have
it
warmer
all
the
while
the
cow
fussed
and
fumed
in
the
stall
then
all
of
a
sudden
she
began
to
talk
to
the
boy
everything
is
wrong
with
me
said
the
cow
i
am
neither
milked
nor
tended
i
have
no
night
fodder
in
my
manger
and
no
bed
has
been
made
under
me
my
mistress
came
here
at
dusk
to
put
things
in
order
for
me
but
she
felt
so
ill
that
she
had
to
go
in
soon
again
and
she
has
not
returned
it
distressing
that
i
should
be
little
and
powerless
said
the
boy
i
do
believe
that
i
am
able
to
help
you
you
ca
make
me
believe
that
you
are
powerless
because
you
are
little
said
the
cow
all
the
elves
that
i
ever
heard
of
were
so
strong
that
they
could
pull
a
whole
load
of
hay
and
strike
a
cow
dead
with
one
fist
the
boy
help
laughing
at
the
cow
they
were
a
very
different
kind
of
elf
from
me
said
he
but
i
loosen
your
halter
and
open
the
door
for
you
so
that
you
can
go
out
and
drink
in
one
of
the
pools
on
the
place
and
then
i
try
to
climb
up
to
the
hayloft
and
throw
down
some
hay
in
your
manger
yes
that
would
be
some
help
said
the
cow
the
boy
did
as
he
had
said
and
when
the
cow
stood
with
a
full
manger
in
front
of
her
he
thought
that
at
last
he
should
get
some
sleep
but
he
had
hardly
crept
down
in
the
bed
before
she
began
anew
to
talk
to
him
you
be
clean
put
out
with
me
if
i
ask
you
for
one
thing
more
said
the
cow
oh
no
i
wo
if
it
only
something
that
i
able
to
do
said
the
boy
then
i
will
ask
you
to
go
into
the
cabin
directly
opposite
and
find
out
how
my
mistress
is
getting
along
i
fear
some
misfortune
has
come
to
her
no
i
ca
do
that
said
the
boy
i
dare
not
show
myself
before
human
beings
you
not
afraid
of
an
old
and
sick
woman
said
the
cow
but
you
do
not
need
to
go
into
the
cabin
just
stand
outside
the
door
and
peep
in
through
the
crack
oh
if
that
is
all
you
ask
of
me
i
do
it
of
course
said
the
boy
with
that
he
opened
the
cowshed
door
and
went
out
in
the
yard
it
was
a
fearful
night
neither
moon
nor
stars
shone
the
wind
blew
a
gale
and
the
rain
came
down
in
torrents
and
the
worst
of
all
was
that
seven
great
owls
sat
in
a
row
on
the
eaves
of
the
cabin
it
was
awful
just
to
hear
them
where
they
sat
and
grumbled
at
the
weather
but
it
was
even
worse
to
think
what
would
happen
to
him
if
one
of
them
should
set
eyes
on
him
that
would
be
the
last
of
him
pity
him
who
is
little
said
the
boy
as
he
ventured
out
in
the
yard
and
he
had
a
right
to
say
this
for
he
was
blown
down
twice
before
he
got
to
the
house
once
the
wind
swept
him
into
a
pool
which
was
so
deep
that
he
came
near
drowning
but
he
got
there
nevertheless
he
clambered
up
a
pair
of
steps
scrambled
over
a
threshold
and
came
into
the
hallway
the
cabin
door
was
closed
but
down
in
one
corner
a
large
piece
had
been
cut
away
that
the
cat
might
go
in
and
out
it
was
no
difficulty
whatever
for
the
boy
to
see
how
things
were
in
the
cabin
he
had
hardly
cast
a
glance
in
there
before
he
staggered
back
and
turned
his
head
away
an
old
woman
lay
stretched
out
on
the
floor
within
she
neither
moved
nor
moaned
and
her
face
shone
strangely
white
it
was
as
if
an
invisible
moon
had
thrown
a
feeble
light
over
it
the
boy
remembered
that
when
his
grandfather
had
died
his
face
had
also
become
so
strangely
and
he
understood
that
the
old
woman
who
lay
on
the
cabin
floor
must
be
dead
death
had
probably
come
to
her
so
suddenly
that
she
did
even
have
time
to
lie
down
on
her
bed
as
he
thought
of
being
alone
with
the
dead
in
the
middle
of
the
dark
night
he
was
terribly
afraid
he
threw
himself
headlong
down
the
steps
and
rushed
back
to
the
cowshed
when
he
told
the
cow
what
he
had
seen
in
the
cabin
she
stopped
eating
so
my
mistress
is
dead
said
she
then
it
will
soon
be
over
for
me
as
well
there
will
always
be
someone
to
look
out
for
you
said
the
boy
comfortingly
ah
you
do
know
said
the
cow
that
i
am
already
twice
as
old
as
a
cow
usually
is
before
she
is
laid
upon
the
but
then
i
do
not
care
to
live
any
longer
since
she
in
there
can
come
no
more
to
care
for
me
she
said
nothing
more
for
a
while
but
the
boy
observed
no
doubt
that
she
neither
slept
nor
ate
it
was
not
long
before
she
began
to
speak
again
is
she
lying
on
the
bare
floor
she
asked
she
is
said
the
boy
she
had
a
habit
of
coming
out
to
the
cowshed
she
continued
and
talking
about
everything
that
troubled
her
i
understood
what
she
said
although
i
could
not
answer
her
these
last
few
days
she
talked
of
how
afraid
she
was
lest
there
would
be
no
one
with
her
when
she
died
she
was
anxious
for
fear
no
one
should
close
her
eyes
and
fold
her
hands
across
her
breast
after
she
was
dead
perhaps
you
go
in
and
do
this
the
boy
hesitated
he
remembered
that
when
his
grandfather
had
died
mother
had
been
very
careful
about
putting
everything
to
rights
he
knew
this
was
something
which
had
to
be
done
but
on
the
other
hand
he
felt
that
he
did
care
go
to
the
dead
in
the
ghastly
night
he
did
say
no
neither
did
he
take
a
step
toward
the
cowshed
door
for
a
couple
of
seconds
the
old
cow
was
silent
just
as
if
she
had
expected
an
answer
but
when
the
boy
said
nothing
she
did
not
repeat
her
request
instead
she
began
to
talk
with
him
of
her
mistress
there
was
much
to
tell
first
and
foremost
about
all
the
children
which
she
had
brought
up
they
had
been
in
the
cowshed
every
day
and
in
the
summer
they
had
taken
the
cattle
to
pasture
on
the
swamp
and
in
the
groves
so
the
old
cow
knew
all
about
them
they
had
been
splendid
all
of
them
and
happy
and
industrious
a
cow
knew
well
enough
what
her
caretakers
were
good
for
there
was
also
much
to
be
said
about
the
farm
it
had
not
always
been
as
poor
as
it
was
now
it
was
very
large
although
the
greater
part
of
it
consisted
of
swamps
and
stony
groves
there
was
not
much
room
for
fields
but
there
was
plenty
of
good
fodder
everywhere
at
one
time
there
had
been
a
cow
for
every
stall
in
the
cowshed
and
the
oxshed
which
was
now
empty
had
at
one
time
been
filled
with
oxen
and
then
there
was
life
and
gayety
both
in
cabin
and
cowhouse
when
the
mistress
opened
the
cowshed
door
she
would
hum
and
sing
and
all
the
cows
lowed
with
gladness
when
they
heard
her
coming
but
the
good
man
had
died
when
the
children
were
so
small
that
they
could
not
be
of
any
assistance
and
the
mistress
had
to
take
charge
of
the
farm
and
all
the
work
and
responsibility
she
had
been
as
strong
as
a
man
and
had
both
ploughed
and
reaped
in
the
evenings
when
she
came
into
the
cowshed
to
milk
sometimes
she
was
so
tired
that
she
wept
then
she
dashed
away
her
tears
and
was
cheerful
again
it
does
matter
good
times
are
coming
again
for
me
too
if
only
my
children
grow
up
yes
if
they
only
grow
up
but
as
soon
as
the
children
were
grown
a
strange
longing
came
over
them
they
did
want
to
stay
at
home
but
went
away
to
a
strange
country
their
mother
never
got
any
help
from
them
a
couple
of
her
children
were
married
before
they
went
away
and
they
had
left
their
children
behind
in
the
old
home
and
now
these
children
followed
the
mistress
in
the
cowshed
just
as
her
own
had
done
they
tended
the
cows
and
were
fine
good
folk
and
in
the
evenings
when
the
mistress
was
so
tired
out
that
she
could
fall
asleep
in
the
middle
of
the
milking
she
would
rouse
herself
again
to
renewed
courage
by
thinking
of
them
good
times
are
coming
for
me
too
said
she
and
shook
off
sleep
when
once
they
are
grown
but
when
these
children
grew
up
they
went
away
to
their
parents
in
the
strange
land
no
one
came
back
no
one
stayed
at
home
the
old
mistress
was
left
alone
on
the
farm
probably
she
had
never
asked
them
to
remain
with
her
think
you
rödlinna
that
i
would
ask
them
to
stay
here
with
me
when
they
can
go
out
in
the
world
and
have
things
comfortable
she
would
say
as
she
stood
in
the
stall
with
the
old
cow
here
in
småland
they
have
only
poverty
to
look
forward
to
but
when
the
last
grandchild
was
gone
it
was
all
up
with
the
mistress
all
at
once
she
became
bent
and
gray
and
tottered
as
she
walked
as
if
she
no
longer
had
the
strength
to
move
about
she
stopped
working
she
did
not
care
to
look
after
the
farm
but
let
everything
go
to
rack
and
ruin
she
did
repair
the
houses
and
she
sold
both
the
cows
and
the
oxen
the
only
one
that
she
kept
was
the
old
cow
who
now
talked
with
thumbietot
her
she
let
live
because
all
the
children
had
tended
her
she
could
have
taken
maids
and
into
her
service
who
would
have
helped
her
with
the
work
but
she
could
bear
to
see
strangers
around
her
since
her
own
had
deserted
her
perhaps
she
was
better
satisfied
to
let
the
farm
go
to
ruin
since
none
of
her
children
were
coming
back
to
take
it
after
she
was
gone
she
did
not
mind
that
she
herself
became
poor
because
she
did
value
that
which
was
only
hers
but
she
was
troubled
lest
the
children
should
find
out
how
hard
she
had
it
if
only
the
children
do
not
hear
of
this
if
only
the
children
do
not
hear
of
this
she
sighed
as
she
tottered
through
the
cowhouse
the
children
wrote
constantly
and
begged
her
to
come
out
to
them
but
this
she
did
not
wish
she
did
want
to
see
the
land
that
had
taken
them
from
her
she
was
angry
with
it
it
foolish
of
me
perhaps
that
i
do
not
like
that
land
which
has
been
so
good
for
them
said
she
but
i
do
want
to
see
it
she
never
thought
of
anything
but
the
children
and
of
this
that
they
must
needs
have
gone
when
summer
came
she
led
the
cow
out
to
graze
in
the
big
swamp
all
day
she
would
sit
on
the
edge
of
the
swamp
her
hands
in
her
lap
and
on
the
way
home
she
would
say
you
see
rödlinna
if
there
had
been
large
rich
fields
here
in
place
of
these
barren
swamps
then
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
them
to
leave
she
could
become
furious
with
the
swamp
which
spread
out
so
big
and
did
no
good
she
could
sit
and
talk
about
how
it
was
the
swamp
fault
that
the
children
had
left
her
this
last
evening
she
had
been
more
trembly
and
feeble
than
ever
before
she
could
not
even
do
the
milking
she
had
leaned
against
the
manger
and
talked
about
two
strangers
who
had
been
to
see
her
and
had
asked
if
they
might
buy
the
swamp
they
wanted
to
drain
it
and
sow
and
raise
grain
on
it
this
had
made
her
both
anxious
and
glad
do
you
hear
rödlinna
she
had
said
do
you
hear
they
said
that
grain
can
grow
on
the
swamp
now
i
shall
write
to
the
children
to
come
home
now
not
have
to
stay
away
any
longer
for
now
they
can
get
their
bread
here
at
home
it
was
this
that
she
had
gone
into
the
cabin
to
do
the
boy
heard
no
more
of
what
the
old
cow
said
he
had
opened
the
cowhouse
door
and
gone
across
the
yard
and
in
to
the
dead
whom
he
had
but
lately
been
so
afraid
of
it
was
not
so
poor
in
the
cabin
as
he
had
expected
it
was
well
supplied
with
the
sort
of
things
one
generally
finds
among
those
who
have
relatives
in
america
in
a
corner
there
was
an
american
rocking
chair
on
the
table
before
the
window
lay
a
brocaded
plush
cover
there
was
a
pretty
spread
on
the
bed
on
the
walls
in
frames
hung
the
photographs
of
the
children
and
grandchildren
who
had
gone
away
on
the
bureau
stood
high
vases
and
a
couple
of
candlesticks
with
thick
spiral
candles
in
them
the
boy
searched
for
a
matchbox
and
lighted
these
candles
not
because
he
needed
more
light
than
he
already
had
but
because
he
thought
that
this
was
one
way
to
honour
the
dead
then
he
went
up
to
her
closed
her
eyes
folded
her
hands
across
her
breast
and
stroked
back
the
thin
gray
hair
from
her
face
he
thought
no
more
about
being
afraid
of
her
he
was
so
deeply
grieved
because
she
had
been
forced
to
live
out
her
old
age
in
loneliness
and
longing
he
at
least
would
watch
over
her
dead
body
this
night
he
hunted
up
the
psalm
book
and
seated
himself
to
read
a
couple
of
psalms
in
an
undertone
but
in
the
middle
of
the
reading
he
paused
because
he
had
begun
to
think
about
his
mother
and
father
think
that
parents
can
long
so
for
their
children
this
he
had
never
known
think
that
life
can
be
as
though
it
was
over
for
them
when
the
children
are
away
think
if
those
at
home
longed
for
him
in
the
same
way
that
this
old
peasant
woman
had
longed
this
thought
made
him
happy
but
he
dared
not
believe
in
it
he
had
not
been
such
a
one
that
anybody
could
long
for
him
but
what
he
had
not
been
perhaps
he
could
become
round
about
him
he
saw
the
portraits
of
those
who
were
away
they
were
big
strong
men
and
women
with
earnest
faces
there
were
brides
in
long
veils
and
gentlemen
in
fine
clothes
and
there
were
children
with
waved
hair
and
pretty
white
dresses
and
he
thought
that
they
all
stared
blindly
into
vacancy
and
did
not
want
to
see
poor
you
said
the
boy
to
the
portraits
your
mother
is
dead
you
can
not
make
reparation
now
because
you
went
away
from
her
but
my
mother
is
living
here
he
paused
and
nodded
and
smiled
to
himself
my
mother
is
living
said
he
both
father
and
mother
are
living
from
taberg
to
huskvarna
april
the
boy
sat
awake
nearly
all
night
but
toward
morning
he
fell
asleep
and
then
he
dreamed
of
his
father
and
mother
he
could
hardly
recognise
them
they
had
both
grown
gray
and
had
old
and
wrinkled
faces
he
asked
how
this
had
come
about
and
they
answered
that
they
had
aged
so
because
they
had
longed
for
him
he
was
both
touched
and
astonished
for
he
had
never
believed
but
what
they
were
glad
to
be
rid
of
him
when
the
boy
awoke
the
morning
was
come
with
fine
clear
weather
first
he
himself
ate
a
bit
of
bread
which
he
found
in
the
cabin
then
he
gave
morning
feed
to
both
geese
and
cow
and
opened
the
cowhouse
door
so
that
the
cow
could
go
over
to
the
nearest
farm
when
the
cow
came
along
all
by
herself
the
neighbours
would
no
doubt
understand
that
something
was
wrong
with
her
mistress
they
would
hurry
over
to
the
desolate
farm
to
see
how
the
old
woman
was
getting
along
and
then
they
would
find
her
dead
body
and
bury
it
the
boy
and
the
geese
had
barely
raised
themselves
into
the
air
when
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
high
mountain
with
almost
perpendicular
walls
and
an
abrupt
top
and
they
understood
that
this
must
be
taberg
on
the
summit
stood
akka
with
yksi
and
kaksi
kolmi
and
neljä
viisi
and
knusi
and
all
six
goslings
and
waited
for
them
there
was
a
rejoicing
and
a
cackling
and
a
fluttering
and
a
calling
which
no
one
can
describe
when
they
saw
that
the
and
dunfin
had
succeeded
in
finding
thumbietot
the
woods
grew
pretty
high
up
on
taberg
sides
but
her
highest
peak
was
barren
and
from
there
one
could
look
out
in
all
directions
if
one
gazed
toward
the
east
or
south
or
west
then
there
was
hardly
anything
to
be
seen
but
a
poor
highland
with
dark
brown
morasses
lakes
and
bluish
the
boy
could
keep
from
thinking
it
was
true
that
the
one
who
had
created
this
had
taken
very
great
pains
with
his
work
but
had
thrown
it
together
in
a
hurry
but
if
one
glanced
to
the
north
it
was
altogether
different
here
it
looked
as
if
it
had
been
worked
out
with
the
utmost
care
and
affection
in
this
direction
one
saw
only
beautiful
mountains
soft
valleys
and
winding
rivers
all
the
way
to
the
big
lake
vettern
which
lay
and
transparently
clear
and
shone
as
if
it
was
filled
with
water
but
with
blue
light
it
was
vettern
that
made
it
so
pretty
to
look
toward
the
north
because
it
looked
as
though
a
blue
stream
had
risen
up
from
the
lake
and
spread
itself
over
land
also
groves
and
hills
and
roofs
and
the
spires
of
jönköping
city
which
shimmered
along
vettern
shores
lay
enveloped
in
pale
blue
which
caressed
the
eye
if
there
were
countries
in
heaven
they
too
must
be
blue
like
this
thought
the
boy
and
imagined
that
he
had
gotten
a
faint
idea
of
how
it
must
look
in
paradise
later
in
the
day
when
the
geese
continued
their
journey
they
flew
up
toward
the
blue
valley
they
were
in
holiday
humour
shrieked
and
made
such
a
racket
that
no
one
who
had
ears
could
help
hearing
them
this
happened
to
be
the
first
really
fine
spring
day
they
had
had
in
this
section
until
now
the
spring
had
done
its
work
under
rain
and
bluster
and
now
when
it
had
all
of
a
sudden
become
fine
weather
the
people
were
filled
with
such
a
longing
after
summer
warmth
and
green
woods
that
they
could
hardly
perform
their
tasks
and
when
the
wild
geese
rode
by
high
above
the
ground
cheerful
and
free
there
one
who
did
not
drop
what
he
had
in
hand
and
glance
at
them
the
first
ones
who
saw
the
wild
geese
that
day
were
miners
on
taberg
who
were
digging
ore
at
the
mouth
of
the
mine
when
they
heard
them
cackle
they
paused
in
their
drilling
for
ore
and
one
of
them
called
to
the
birds
where
are
you
going
where
are
you
going
the
geese
understand
what
he
said
but
the
boy
leaned
forward
over
the
and
answered
for
them
where
there
is
neither
pick
nor
hammer
when
the
miners
heard
the
words
they
thought
it
was
their
own
longing
that
made
the
sound
like
human
speech
take
us
along
with
you
take
us
along
with
you
they
cried
not
this
year
shrieked
the
boy
not
this
year
the
wild
geese
followed
taberg
river
down
toward
monk
lake
and
all
the
while
they
made
the
same
racket
here
on
the
narrow
between
monk
and
vettern
lakes
lay
jönköping
with
its
great
factories
the
wild
geese
rode
first
over
monksjö
paper
mills
the
noon
rest
hour
was
just
over
and
the
big
workmen
were
streaming
down
to
the
when
they
heard
the
wild
geese
they
stopped
a
moment
to
listen
to
them
where
are
you
going
where
are
you
going
called
the
workmen
the
wild
geese
understood
nothing
of
what
they
said
but
the
boy
answered
for
them
there
where
there
are
neither
machines
nor
when
the
workmen
heard
the
answer
they
believed
it
was
their
own
longing
that
made
the
sound
like
human
speech
take
us
along
with
you
not
this
year
answered
the
boy
not
this
year
next
the
geese
rode
over
the
match
factory
which
lies
on
the
shores
of
vettern
large
as
a
fortress
and
lifts
its
high
chimneys
toward
the
sky
not
a
soul
moved
out
in
the
yards
but
in
a
large
hall
young
sat
and
filled
they
had
opened
a
window
on
account
of
the
beautiful
weather
and
through
it
came
the
wild
geese
call
the
one
who
sat
nearest
the
window
leaned
out
with
a
in
her
hand
and
cried
where
are
you
going
where
are
you
going
to
that
land
where
there
is
no
need
of
either
light
or
matches
said
the
boy
the
girl
thought
that
what
she
had
heard
was
only
but
since
she
thought
she
had
distinguished
a
couple
of
words
she
called
out
in
answer
take
me
along
with
you
not
this
year
replied
the
boy
not
this
year
east
of
the
factories
rises
jönköping
on
the
most
glorious
spot
that
any
city
can
occupy
the
narrow
vettern
has
high
steep
both
on
the
eastern
and
western
sides
but
straight
south
the
are
broken
down
just
as
if
to
make
room
for
a
large
gate
through
which
one
reaches
the
lake
and
in
the
middle
of
the
gate
with
mountains
to
the
left
and
mountains
to
the
right
with
monk
lake
behind
it
and
vettern
in
front
of
it
lies
jönköping
the
wild
geese
travelled
forward
over
the
long
narrow
city
and
behaved
themselves
here
just
as
they
had
done
in
the
country
but
in
the
city
there
was
no
one
who
answered
them
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
city
folks
should
stop
out
in
the
streets
and
call
to
the
wild
geese
the
trip
extended
further
along
vettern
shores
and
after
a
little
they
came
to
sanna
sanitarium
some
of
the
patients
had
gone
out
on
the
veranda
to
enjoy
the
spring
air
and
in
this
way
they
heard
the
where
are
you
going
asked
one
of
them
with
such
a
feeble
voice
that
he
was
scarcely
heard
to
that
land
where
there
is
neither
sorrow
nor
sickness
answered
the
boy
take
us
along
with
you
said
the
sick
ones
not
this
year
answered
the
boy
not
this
year
when
they
had
travelled
still
farther
on
they
came
to
huskvarna
it
lay
in
a
valley
the
mountains
around
it
were
steep
and
beautifully
formed
a
river
rushed
along
the
heights
in
long
and
narrow
falls
big
workshops
and
factories
lay
below
the
mountain
walls
and
scattered
over
the
were
the
workingmens
homes
encircled
by
little
gardens
and
in
the
centre
of
the
valley
lay
the
schoolhouse
just
as
the
wild
geese
came
along
a
bell
rang
and
a
crowd
of
school
children
marched
out
in
line
they
were
so
numerous
that
the
whole
schoolyard
was
filled
with
them
where
are
you
going
where
are
you
going
the
children
shouted
when
they
heard
the
wild
geese
where
there
are
neither
books
nor
lessons
to
be
found
answered
the
boy
take
us
along
shrieked
the
children
not
this
year
but
next
cried
the
boy
not
this
year
but
next
the
big
bird
lake
jarro
the
wild
duck
on
the
eastern
shore
of
vettern
lies
mount
omberg
east
of
omberg
lies
dagmosse
east
of
dagmosse
lies
lake
takern
around
the
whole
of
takern
spreads
the
big
even
östergöta
plain
takern
is
a
pretty
large
lake
and
in
olden
times
it
must
have
been
still
larger
but
then
the
people
thought
it
covered
entirely
too
much
of
the
fertile
plain
so
they
attempted
to
drain
the
water
from
it
that
they
might
sow
and
reap
on
the
but
they
did
not
succeed
in
laying
waste
the
entire
lake
which
had
evidently
been
their
intention
therefore
it
still
hides
a
lot
of
land
since
the
draining
the
lake
has
become
so
shallow
that
hardly
at
any
point
is
it
more
than
a
couple
of
metres
deep
the
shores
have
become
marshy
and
muddy
and
out
in
the
lake
little
stick
up
above
the
water
surface
now
there
is
one
who
loves
to
stand
with
his
feet
in
the
water
if
he
can
just
keep
his
body
and
head
in
the
air
and
that
is
the
reed
and
it
can
not
find
a
better
place
to
grow
upon
than
the
long
shallow
takern
shores
and
around
the
little
it
thrives
so
well
that
it
grows
taller
than
a
man
height
and
so
thick
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
push
a
boat
through
it
it
forms
a
broad
green
enclosure
around
the
whole
lake
so
that
it
is
only
accessible
in
a
few
places
where
the
people
have
taken
away
the
reeds
but
if
the
reeds
shut
the
people
out
they
give
in
return
shelter
and
protection
to
many
other
things
in
the
reeds
there
are
a
lot
of
little
dams
and
canals
with
green
still
water
where
duckweed
and
pondweed
run
to
seed
and
where
and
blackfish
and
worms
are
hatched
out
in
uncountable
masses
and
all
along
the
shores
of
these
little
dams
and
canals
there
are
many
places
where
seabirds
hatch
their
eggs
and
bring
up
their
young
without
being
disturbed
either
by
enemies
or
food
worries
an
incredible
number
of
birds
live
in
the
takern
reeds
and
more
and
more
gather
there
every
year
as
it
becomes
known
what
a
splendid
abode
it
is
the
first
who
settled
there
were
the
wild
ducks
and
they
still
live
there
by
thousands
but
they
no
longer
own
the
entire
lake
for
they
have
been
obliged
to
share
it
with
swans
grebes
coots
loons
and
a
lot
of
others
takern
is
certainly
the
largest
and
choicest
bird
lake
in
the
whole
country
and
the
birds
may
count
themselves
lucky
as
long
as
they
own
such
a
retreat
but
it
is
uncertain
just
how
long
they
will
be
in
control
of
reeds
and
for
human
beings
can
not
forget
that
the
lake
extends
over
a
considerable
portion
of
good
and
fertile
soil
and
every
now
and
then
the
proposition
to
drain
it
comes
up
among
them
and
if
these
propositions
were
carried
out
the
many
thousands
of
would
be
forced
to
move
from
this
quarter
at
the
time
when
nils
holgersson
travelled
around
with
the
wild
geese
there
lived
at
takern
a
wild
duck
named
jarro
he
was
a
young
bird
who
had
only
lived
one
summer
one
fall
and
a
winter
now
it
was
his
first
spring
he
had
just
returned
from
south
africa
and
had
reached
takern
in
such
good
season
that
the
ice
was
still
on
the
lake
one
evening
when
he
and
the
other
young
wild
ducks
played
at
racing
backward
and
forward
over
the
lake
a
hunter
fired
a
couple
of
shots
at
them
and
jarro
was
wounded
in
the
breast
he
thought
he
should
die
but
in
order
that
the
one
who
had
shot
him
should
get
him
into
his
power
he
continued
to
fly
as
long
as
he
possibly
could
he
did
think
whither
he
was
directing
his
course
but
only
struggled
to
get
far
away
when
his
strength
failed
him
so
that
he
could
not
fly
any
farther
he
was
no
longer
on
the
lake
he
had
flown
a
bit
inland
and
now
he
sank
down
before
the
entrance
to
one
of
the
big
farms
which
lie
along
the
shores
of
takern
a
moment
later
a
young
happened
along
he
saw
jarro
and
came
and
lifted
him
up
but
jarro
who
asked
for
nothing
but
to
be
let
die
in
peace
gathered
his
last
powers
and
nipped
the
in
the
finger
so
he
should
let
go
of
him
jarro
did
succeed
in
freeing
himself
the
encounter
had
this
good
in
it
at
any
rate
the
noticed
that
the
bird
was
alive
he
carried
him
very
gently
into
the
cottage
and
showed
him
to
the
mistress
of
the
house
a
young
woman
with
a
kindly
face
at
once
she
took
jarro
from
the
stroked
him
on
the
back
and
wiped
away
the
blood
which
trickled
down
through
the
she
looked
him
over
very
carefully
and
when
she
saw
how
pretty
he
was
with
his
shining
head
his
white
his
back
and
his
blue
she
must
have
thought
that
it
was
a
pity
for
him
to
die
she
promptly
put
a
basket
in
order
and
tucked
the
bird
into
it
all
the
while
jarro
fluttered
and
struggled
to
get
loose
but
when
he
understood
that
the
people
did
intend
to
kill
him
he
settled
down
in
the
basket
with
a
sense
of
pleasure
now
it
was
evident
how
exhausted
he
was
from
pain
and
loss
of
blood
the
mistress
carried
the
basket
across
the
floor
to
place
it
in
the
corner
by
the
fireplace
but
before
she
put
it
down
jarro
was
already
fast
asleep
in
a
little
while
jarro
was
awakened
by
someone
who
nudged
him
gently
when
he
opened
his
eyes
he
experienced
such
an
awful
shock
that
he
almost
lost
his
senses
now
he
was
lost
for
there
stood
one
who
was
more
dangerous
than
either
human
beings
or
birds
of
prey
it
was
no
less
a
thing
than
caesar
himself
the
dog
who
nosed
around
him
inquisitively
how
pitifully
scared
had
he
not
been
last
summer
when
he
was
still
a
little
duckling
every
time
it
had
sounded
over
the
caesar
is
coming
caesar
is
coming
when
he
had
seen
the
brown
and
white
spotted
dog
with
the
jowls
come
wading
through
the
reeds
he
had
believed
that
he
beheld
death
itself
he
had
always
hoped
that
he
would
never
have
to
live
through
that
moment
when
he
should
meet
caesar
face
to
face
but
to
his
sorrow
he
must
have
fallen
down
in
the
very
yard
where
caesar
lived
for
there
he
stood
right
over
him
who
are
you
he
growled
how
did
you
get
into
the
house
do
you
belong
down
among
the
reed
banks
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
he
gained
the
courage
to
answer
do
be
angry
with
me
caesar
because
i
came
into
the
house
said
he
it
is
my
fault
i
have
been
wounded
by
a
gunshot
it
was
the
people
themselves
who
laid
me
in
this
basket
oho
so
it
the
folks
themselves
that
have
placed
you
here
said
caesar
then
it
is
surely
their
intention
to
cure
you
although
for
my
part
i
think
it
would
be
wiser
for
them
to
eat
you
up
since
you
are
in
their
power
but
at
any
rate
you
are
tabooed
in
the
house
you
look
so
scared
now
we
not
down
on
takern
with
that
caesar
laid
himself
to
sleep
in
front
of
the
blazing
as
soon
as
jarro
understood
that
this
terrible
danger
was
past
extreme
lassitude
came
over
him
and
he
fell
asleep
anew
the
next
time
jarro
awoke
he
saw
that
a
dish
with
grain
and
water
stood
before
him
he
was
still
quite
ill
but
he
felt
hungry
nevertheless
and
began
to
eat
when
the
mistress
saw
that
he
ate
she
came
up
and
petted
him
and
looked
pleased
after
that
jarro
fell
asleep
again
for
several
days
he
did
nothing
but
eat
and
sleep
one
morning
jarro
felt
so
well
that
he
stepped
from
the
basket
and
wandered
along
the
floor
but
he
had
gone
very
far
before
he
keeled
over
and
lay
there
then
came
caesar
opened
his
big
jaws
and
grabbed
him
jarro
believed
of
course
that
the
dog
was
going
to
bite
him
to
death
but
caesar
carried
him
back
to
the
basket
without
harming
him
because
of
this
jarro
acquired
such
a
confidence
in
the
dog
caesar
that
on
his
next
walk
in
the
cottage
he
went
over
to
the
dog
and
lay
down
beside
him
thereafter
caesar
and
he
became
good
friends
and
every
day
for
several
hours
jarro
lay
and
slept
between
caesar
paws
but
an
even
greater
affection
than
he
felt
for
caesar
did
jarro
feel
toward
his
mistress
of
her
he
had
not
the
least
fear
but
rubbed
his
head
against
her
hand
when
she
came
and
fed
him
whenever
she
went
out
of
the
cottage
he
sighed
with
regret
and
when
she
came
back
he
cried
welcome
to
her
in
his
own
language
jarro
forgot
entirely
how
afraid
he
had
been
of
both
dogs
and
humans
in
other
days
he
thought
now
that
they
were
gentle
and
kind
and
he
loved
them
he
wished
that
he
were
well
so
he
could
fly
down
to
takern
and
tell
the
wild
ducks
that
their
enemies
were
not
dangerous
and
that
they
need
not
fear
them
he
had
observed
that
the
human
beings
as
well
as
caesar
had
calm
eyes
which
it
did
one
good
to
look
into
the
only
one
in
the
cottage
whose
glance
he
did
not
care
to
meet
was
clawina
the
house
cat
she
did
him
no
harm
either
but
he
could
place
any
confidence
in
her
then
too
she
quarrelled
with
him
constantly
because
he
loved
human
beings
you
think
they
protect
you
because
they
are
fond
of
you
said
clawina
you
just
wait
until
you
are
fat
enough
then
they
wring
the
neck
off
you
i
know
them
i
do
jarro
like
all
birds
had
a
tender
and
affectionate
heart
and
he
was
unutterably
distressed
when
he
heard
this
he
could
imagine
that
his
mistress
would
wish
to
wring
the
neck
off
him
nor
could
he
believe
any
such
thing
of
her
son
the
little
boy
who
sat
for
hours
beside
his
basket
and
babbled
and
chattered
he
seemed
to
think
that
both
of
them
had
the
same
love
for
him
that
he
had
for
them
one
day
when
jarro
and
caesar
lay
on
the
usual
spot
before
the
fire
clawina
sat
on
the
hearth
and
began
to
tease
the
wild
duck
i
wonder
jarro
what
you
wild
ducks
will
do
next
year
when
takern
is
drained
and
turned
into
grain
fields
said
clawina
what
that
you
say
clawina
cried
jarro
and
jumped
up
scared
through
and
through
i
always
forget
jarro
that
you
do
not
understand
human
speech
like
caesar
and
myself
answered
the
cat
or
else
you
surely
would
have
heard
how
the
men
who
were
here
in
the
cottage
yesterday
said
that
all
the
water
was
going
to
be
drained
from
takern
and
that
next
year
the
would
be
as
dry
as
a
and
now
i
wonder
where
you
wild
ducks
will
go
when
jarro
heard
this
talk
he
was
so
furious
that
he
hissed
like
a
snake
you
are
just
as
mean
as
a
common
coot
he
screamed
at
clawina
you
only
want
to
incite
me
against
human
beings
i
do
believe
they
want
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
they
must
know
that
takern
is
the
wild
ducks
property
why
should
they
make
so
many
birds
homeless
and
unhappy
you
have
certainly
hit
upon
all
this
to
scare
me
i
hope
that
you
may
be
torn
in
pieces
by
gorgo
the
eagle
i
hope
that
my
mistress
will
chop
off
your
whiskers
but
jarro
could
shut
clawina
up
with
this
outburst
so
you
think
lying
said
she
ask
caesar
then
he
was
also
in
the
house
last
night
caesar
never
lies
caesar
said
jarro
you
understand
human
speech
much
better
than
clawina
say
that
she
has
heard
aright
think
how
it
would
be
if
the
people
drained
takern
and
changed
the
into
fields
then
there
would
be
no
more
pondweed
or
for
the
grown
wild
ducks
and
no
blackfish
or
worms
or
for
the
ducklings
then
the
would
disappear
where
now
the
ducklings
conceal
themselves
until
they
are
able
to
fly
all
ducks
would
be
compelled
to
move
away
from
here
and
seek
another
home
but
where
shall
they
find
a
retreat
like
takern
caesar
say
that
clawina
has
not
heard
aright
it
was
extraordinary
to
watch
caesar
behaviour
during
this
conversation
he
had
been
the
whole
time
before
but
now
when
jarro
turned
to
him
he
panted
laid
his
long
nose
on
his
forepaws
and
was
sound
asleep
within
the
wink
of
an
eyelid
the
cat
looked
down
at
caesar
with
a
knowing
smile
i
believe
that
caesar
does
care
to
answer
you
she
said
to
jarro
it
is
with
him
as
with
all
dogs
they
will
never
acknowledge
that
humans
can
do
any
wrong
but
you
can
rely
upon
my
word
at
any
rate
i
shall
tell
you
why
they
wish
to
drain
the
lake
just
now
as
long
as
you
wild
ducks
still
had
the
power
on
takern
they
did
not
wish
to
drain
it
for
at
least
they
got
some
good
out
of
you
but
now
grebes
and
coots
and
other
birds
who
are
no
good
as
food
have
infested
nearly
all
the
and
the
people
do
think
they
need
let
the
lake
remain
on
their
account
jarro
did
trouble
himself
to
answer
clawina
but
raised
his
head
and
shouted
in
caesar
ear
caesar
you
know
that
on
takern
there
are
still
so
many
ducks
left
that
they
fill
the
air
like
clouds
say
it
is
true
that
human
beings
intend
to
make
all
of
these
homeless
then
caesar
sprang
up
with
such
a
sudden
outburst
at
clawina
that
she
had
to
save
herself
by
jumping
up
on
a
shelf
i
teach
you
to
keep
quiet
when
i
want
to
sleep
bawled
caesar
of
course
i
know
that
there
is
some
talk
about
draining
the
lake
this
year
but
there
been
talk
of
this
many
times
before
without
anything
coming
of
it
and
that
draining
business
is
a
matter
in
which
i
take
no
stock
whatever
for
how
would
it
go
with
the
game
if
takern
were
laid
waste
you
a
donkey
to
gloat
over
a
thing
like
that
what
will
you
and
i
have
to
amuse
ourselves
with
when
there
are
no
more
birds
on
takern
the
april
a
couple
of
days
later
jarro
was
so
well
that
he
could
fly
all
about
the
house
then
he
was
petted
a
good
deal
by
the
mistress
and
the
little
boy
ran
out
in
the
yard
and
plucked
the
first
for
him
which
had
sprung
up
when
the
mistress
caressed
him
jarro
thought
that
although
he
was
now
so
strong
that
he
could
fly
down
to
takern
at
any
time
he
should
care
to
be
separated
from
the
human
beings
he
had
no
objection
to
remaining
with
them
all
his
life
but
early
one
morning
the
mistress
placed
a
halter
or
noose
over
jarro
which
prevented
him
from
using
his
wings
and
then
she
turned
him
over
to
the
who
had
found
him
in
the
yard
the
poked
him
under
his
arm
and
went
down
to
takern
with
him
the
ice
had
melted
away
while
jarro
had
been
ill
the
old
dry
fall
leaves
still
stood
along
the
shores
and
islets
but
all
the
had
begun
to
take
root
down
in
the
deep
and
the
green
stems
had
already
reached
the
surface
and
now
nearly
all
the
migratory
birds
were
at
home
the
curlews
hooked
bills
peeped
out
from
the
reeds
the
grebes
glided
about
with
new
around
the
neck
and
the
were
gathering
straws
for
their
nests
the
got
into
a
scow
laid
jarro
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
began
to
pole
himself
out
on
the
lake
jarro
who
had
now
accustomed
himself
to
expect
only
good
of
human
beings
said
to
caesar
who
was
also
in
the
party
that
he
was
very
grateful
toward
the
for
taking
him
out
on
the
lake
but
there
was
no
need
to
keep
him
so
closely
guarded
for
he
did
not
intend
to
fly
away
to
this
caesar
made
no
reply
he
was
very
that
morning
the
only
thing
which
struck
jarro
as
being
a
bit
peculiar
was
that
the
had
taken
his
gun
along
he
could
believe
that
any
of
the
good
folk
in
the
cottage
would
want
to
shoot
birds
and
beside
caesar
had
told
him
that
the
people
did
hunt
at
this
time
of
the
year
it
is
a
prohibited
time
he
had
said
although
this
does
concern
me
of
course
the
went
over
to
one
of
the
little
there
he
stepped
from
the
boat
gathered
some
old
reeds
into
a
pile
and
lay
down
behind
it
jarro
was
permitted
to
wander
around
on
the
ground
with
the
halter
over
his
wings
and
tethered
to
the
boat
with
a
long
string
suddenly
jarro
caught
sight
of
some
young
ducks
and
drakes
in
whose
company
he
had
formerly
raced
backward
and
forward
over
the
lake
they
were
a
long
way
off
but
jarro
called
them
to
him
with
a
couple
of
loud
shouts
they
responded
and
a
large
and
beautiful
flock
approached
before
they
got
there
jarro
began
to
tell
them
about
his
marvellous
rescue
and
of
the
kindness
of
human
beings
just
then
two
shots
sounded
behind
him
three
ducks
sank
down
in
the
reeds
lifeless
and
caesar
bounced
out
and
captured
them
then
jarro
understood
the
human
beings
had
only
saved
him
that
they
might
use
him
as
a
and
they
had
also
succeeded
three
ducks
had
died
on
his
account
he
thought
he
should
die
of
shame
he
thought
that
even
his
friend
caesar
looked
contemptuously
at
him
and
when
they
came
home
to
the
cottage
he
did
dare
lie
down
and
sleep
beside
the
dog
the
next
morning
jarro
was
again
taken
out
on
the
shallows
this
time
too
he
saw
some
ducks
but
when
he
observed
that
they
flew
toward
him
he
called
to
them
away
away
be
careful
fly
in
another
direction
there
a
hunter
hidden
behind
the
i
only
a
and
he
actually
succeeded
in
preventing
them
from
coming
within
shooting
distance
jarro
had
scarcely
had
time
to
taste
of
a
so
busy
was
he
in
keeping
watch
he
called
out
his
warning
as
soon
as
a
bird
drew
nigh
he
even
warned
the
grebes
although
he
detested
them
because
they
crowded
the
ducks
out
of
their
best
but
he
did
not
wish
that
any
bird
should
meet
with
misfortune
on
his
account
and
thanks
to
vigilance
the
had
to
go
home
without
firing
off
a
single
shot
despite
this
fact
caesar
looked
less
displeased
than
on
the
previous
day
and
when
evening
came
he
took
jarro
in
his
mouth
carried
him
over
to
the
fireplace
and
let
him
sleep
between
his
forepaws
nevertheless
jarro
was
no
longer
contented
in
the
cottage
but
was
grievously
unhappy
his
heart
suffered
at
the
thought
that
humans
never
had
loved
him
when
the
mistress
or
the
little
boy
came
forward
to
caress
him
he
stuck
his
bill
under
his
wing
and
pretended
that
he
slept
for
several
days
jarro
continued
his
distressful
and
already
he
was
known
all
over
takern
then
it
happened
one
morning
while
he
called
as
usual
have
a
care
birds
do
come
near
me
only
a
that
a
came
floating
toward
the
shallows
where
he
was
tied
this
was
nothing
especially
remarkable
it
was
a
nest
from
the
year
before
and
since
are
built
in
such
a
way
that
they
can
move
on
water
like
boats
it
often
happens
that
they
drift
out
toward
the
lake
still
jarro
stood
there
and
stared
at
the
nest
because
it
came
so
straight
toward
the
islet
that
it
looked
as
though
someone
had
steered
its
course
over
the
water
as
the
nest
came
nearer
jarro
saw
that
a
little
human
being
the
tiniest
he
had
ever
seen
sat
in
the
nest
and
rowed
it
forward
with
a
pair
of
sticks
and
this
little
human
called
to
him
go
as
near
the
water
as
you
can
jarro
and
be
ready
to
fly
you
shall
soon
be
freed
a
few
seconds
later
the
lay
near
land
but
the
little
oarsman
did
not
leave
it
but
sat
huddled
up
between
branches
and
straw
jarro
too
held
himself
almost
immovable
he
was
actually
paralysed
with
fear
lest
the
rescuer
should
be
discovered
the
next
thing
which
occurred
was
that
a
flock
of
wild
geese
came
along
then
jarro
woke
up
to
business
and
warned
them
with
loud
shrieks
but
in
spite
of
this
they
flew
backward
and
forward
over
the
shallows
several
times
they
held
themselves
so
high
that
they
were
beyond
shooting
distance
still
the
let
himself
be
tempted
to
fire
a
couple
of
shots
at
them
these
shots
were
hardly
fired
before
the
little
creature
ran
up
on
land
drew
a
tiny
knife
from
its
sheath
and
with
a
couple
of
quick
strokes
cut
loose
jarro
halter
now
fly
away
jarro
before
the
man
has
time
to
load
again
cried
he
while
he
himself
ran
down
to
the
and
poled
away
from
the
shore
the
hunter
had
had
his
gaze
fixed
upon
the
geese
and
had
observed
that
jarro
had
been
freed
but
caesar
had
followed
more
carefully
that
which
happened
and
just
as
jarro
raised
his
wings
he
dashed
forward
and
grabbed
him
by
the
neck
jarro
cried
pitifully
and
the
boy
who
had
freed
him
said
quietly
to
caesar
if
you
are
just
as
honourable
as
you
look
surely
you
can
not
wish
to
force
a
good
bird
to
sit
here
and
entice
others
into
trouble
when
caesar
heard
these
words
he
grinned
viciously
with
his
upper
lip
but
the
next
second
he
dropped
jarro
fly
jarro
said
he
you
are
certainly
too
good
to
be
a
it
was
for
this
that
i
wanted
to
keep
you
here
but
because
it
will
be
lonely
in
the
cottage
without
you
the
lowering
of
the
lake
april
it
was
indeed
very
lonely
in
the
cottage
without
jarro
the
dog
and
the
cat
found
the
time
long
when
they
did
have
him
to
wrangle
over
and
the
housewife
missed
the
glad
quacking
which
he
had
indulged
in
every
time
she
entered
the
house
but
the
one
who
longed
most
for
jarro
was
the
little
boy
per
ola
he
was
but
three
years
old
and
the
only
child
and
in
all
his
life
he
had
never
had
a
playmate
like
jarro
when
he
heard
that
jarro
had
gone
back
to
takern
and
the
wild
ducks
he
be
satisfied
with
this
but
thought
constantly
of
how
he
should
get
him
back
again
per
ola
had
talked
a
good
deal
with
jarro
while
he
lay
still
in
his
basket
and
he
was
certain
that
the
duck
understood
him
he
begged
his
mother
to
take
him
down
to
the
lake
that
he
might
find
jarro
and
persuade
him
to
come
back
to
them
mother
would
listen
to
this
but
the
little
one
did
give
up
his
plan
on
that
account
the
day
after
jarro
had
disappeared
per
ola
was
running
about
in
the
yard
he
played
by
himself
as
usual
but
caesar
lay
on
the
stoop
and
when
mother
let
the
boy
out
she
said
take
care
of
per
ola
caesar
now
if
all
had
been
as
usual
caesar
would
also
have
obeyed
the
command
and
the
boy
would
have
been
so
well
guarded
that
he
could
have
run
the
least
risk
but
caesar
was
not
like
himself
these
days
he
knew
that
the
farmers
who
lived
along
takern
had
held
frequent
conferences
about
the
lowering
of
the
lake
and
that
they
had
almost
settled
the
matter
the
ducks
must
leave
and
caesar
should
nevermore
behold
a
glorious
chase
he
was
so
preoccupied
with
thoughts
of
this
misfortune
that
he
did
not
remember
to
watch
over
per
ola
and
the
little
one
had
scarcely
been
alone
in
the
yard
a
minute
before
he
realised
that
now
the
right
moment
was
come
to
go
down
to
takern
and
talk
with
jarro
he
opened
a
gate
and
wandered
down
toward
the
lake
on
the
narrow
path
which
ran
along
the
banks
as
long
as
he
could
be
seen
from
the
house
he
walked
slowly
but
afterward
he
increased
his
pace
he
was
very
much
afraid
that
mother
or
someone
else
should
call
to
him
that
he
could
go
he
did
wish
to
do
anything
naughty
only
to
persuade
jarro
to
come
home
but
he
felt
that
those
at
home
would
not
have
approved
of
the
undertaking
when
per
ola
came
down
to
the
he
called
jarro
several
times
thereupon
he
stood
for
a
long
time
and
waited
but
no
jarro
appeared
he
saw
several
birds
that
resembled
the
wild
duck
but
they
flew
by
without
noticing
him
and
he
could
understand
that
none
among
them
was
the
right
one
when
jarro
did
come
to
him
the
little
boy
thought
that
it
would
be
easier
to
find
him
if
he
went
out
on
the
lake
there
were
several
good
craft
lying
along
the
shore
but
they
were
tied
the
only
one
that
lay
loose
and
at
liberty
was
an
old
leaky
scow
which
was
so
unfit
that
no
one
thought
of
using
it
but
per
ola
scrambled
up
in
it
without
caring
that
the
whole
bottom
was
filled
with
water
he
had
not
strength
enough
to
use
the
oars
but
instead
he
seated
himself
to
swing
and
rock
in
the
scow
certainly
no
grown
person
would
have
succeeded
in
moving
a
scow
out
on
takern
in
that
manner
but
when
the
tide
is
high
and
to
the
fore
little
children
have
a
marvellous
faculty
for
getting
out
to
sea
per
ola
was
soon
riding
around
on
takern
and
calling
for
jarro
when
the
old
scow
was
rocked
like
this
out
to
sea
its
cracks
opened
wider
and
wider
and
the
water
actually
streamed
into
it
per
ola
pay
the
slightest
attention
to
this
he
sat
upon
the
little
bench
in
front
and
called
to
every
bird
he
saw
and
wondered
why
jarro
appear
at
last
jarro
caught
sight
of
per
ola
he
heard
that
someone
called
him
by
the
name
which
he
had
borne
among
human
beings
and
he
understood
that
the
boy
had
gone
out
on
takern
to
search
for
him
jarro
was
unspeakably
happy
to
find
that
one
of
the
humans
really
loved
him
he
shot
down
toward
per
ola
like
an
arrow
seated
himself
beside
him
and
let
him
caress
him
they
were
both
very
happy
to
see
each
other
again
but
suddenly
jarro
noticed
the
condition
of
the
scow
it
was
with
water
and
was
almost
ready
to
sink
jarro
tried
to
tell
per
ola
that
he
who
could
neither
fly
nor
swim
must
try
to
get
upon
land
but
per
ola
did
understand
him
then
jarro
did
not
wait
an
instant
but
hurried
away
to
get
help
jarro
came
back
in
a
little
while
and
carried
on
his
back
a
tiny
thing
who
was
much
smaller
than
per
ola
himself
if
he
had
been
able
to
talk
and
move
the
boy
would
have
believed
that
it
was
a
doll
instantly
the
little
one
ordered
per
ola
to
pick
up
a
long
slender
pole
that
lay
in
the
bottom
of
the
scow
and
try
to
pole
it
toward
one
of
the
per
ola
obeyed
him
and
he
and
the
tiny
creature
together
steered
the
scow
with
a
couple
of
strokes
they
were
on
a
little
island
and
now
per
ola
was
told
that
he
must
step
on
land
and
just
the
very
moment
that
per
ola
set
foot
on
land
the
scow
was
filled
with
water
and
sank
to
the
bottom
when
per
ola
saw
this
he
was
sure
that
father
and
mother
would
be
very
angry
with
him
he
would
have
started
in
to
cry
if
he
had
found
something
else
to
think
about
soon
namely
a
flock
of
big
gray
birds
who
lighted
on
the
island
the
little
midget
took
him
up
to
them
and
told
him
their
names
and
what
they
said
and
this
was
so
funny
that
per
ola
forgot
everything
else
meanwhile
the
folks
on
the
farm
had
discovered
that
the
boy
had
disappeared
and
had
started
to
search
for
him
they
searched
the
outhouses
looked
in
the
well
and
hunted
through
the
cellar
then
they
went
out
into
the
highways
and
wandered
to
the
neighbouring
farm
to
find
out
if
he
had
strayed
over
there
and
searched
for
him
also
down
by
takern
but
no
matter
how
much
they
sought
they
did
not
find
him
caesar
the
dog
understood
very
well
that
the
were
looking
for
per
ola
but
he
did
nothing
to
lead
them
on
the
right
track
instead
he
lay
still
as
though
the
matter
did
concern
him
later
in
the
day
per
ola
footprints
were
discovered
down
by
the
and
then
came
the
thought
that
the
old
leaky
scow
was
no
longer
on
the
strand
then
one
began
to
understand
how
the
whole
affair
had
come
about
the
farmer
and
his
helpers
immediately
took
out
the
boats
and
went
in
search
of
the
boy
they
rowed
around
on
takern
until
way
late
in
the
evening
without
seeing
the
least
shadow
of
him
they
could
help
believing
that
the
old
scow
had
gone
down
and
that
the
little
one
lay
dead
on
the
in
the
evening
per
ola
mother
hunted
around
on
the
strand
everyone
else
was
convinced
that
the
boy
was
drowned
but
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
believe
this
she
searched
all
the
while
she
searched
between
reeds
and
bulrushes
tramped
and
tramped
on
the
muddy
shore
never
thinking
of
how
deep
her
foot
sank
and
how
wet
she
had
become
she
was
unspeakably
desperate
her
heart
ached
in
her
breast
she
did
not
weep
but
wrung
her
hands
and
called
for
her
child
in
loud
piercing
tones
round
about
her
she
heard
swans
and
ducks
and
curlews
shrieks
she
thought
that
they
followed
her
and
moaned
and
wailed
they
too
surely
they
too
must
be
in
trouble
since
they
moan
so
thought
she
then
she
remembered
these
were
only
birds
that
she
heard
complain
they
surely
had
no
worries
it
was
strange
that
they
did
not
quiet
down
after
sunset
but
she
heard
all
these
uncountable
which
lived
along
takern
send
forth
cry
upon
cry
several
of
them
followed
her
wherever
she
went
others
came
rustling
past
on
light
wings
all
the
air
was
filled
with
moans
and
lamentations
but
the
anguish
which
she
herself
was
suffering
opened
her
heart
she
thought
that
she
was
not
as
far
removed
from
all
other
living
creatures
as
people
usually
think
she
understood
much
better
than
ever
before
how
birds
fared
they
had
their
constant
worries
for
home
and
children
they
as
she
there
was
surely
not
such
a
great
difference
between
them
and
her
as
she
had
heretofore
believed
then
she
happened
to
think
that
it
was
as
good
as
settled
that
these
thousands
of
swans
and
ducks
and
loons
would
lose
their
homes
here
by
takern
it
will
be
very
hard
for
them
she
thought
where
shall
they
bring
up
their
children
now
she
stood
still
and
mused
on
this
it
appeared
to
be
an
excellent
and
agreeable
accomplishment
to
change
a
lake
into
fields
and
meadows
but
let
it
be
some
other
lake
than
takern
some
other
lake
which
was
not
the
home
of
so
many
thousand
creatures
she
remembered
how
on
the
following
day
the
proposition
to
lower
the
lake
was
to
be
decided
and
she
wondered
if
this
was
why
her
little
son
had
been
lost
just
was
it
god
meaning
that
sorrow
should
come
and
open
her
heart
just
before
it
was
too
late
to
avert
the
cruel
act
she
walked
rapidly
up
to
the
house
and
began
to
talk
with
her
husband
about
this
she
spoke
of
the
lake
and
of
the
birds
and
said
that
she
believed
it
was
god
judgment
on
them
both
and
she
soon
found
that
he
was
of
the
same
opinion
they
already
owned
a
large
place
but
if
the
was
carried
into
effect
such
a
goodly
portion
of
the
would
fall
to
their
share
that
their
property
would
be
nearly
doubled
for
this
reason
they
had
been
more
eager
for
the
undertaking
than
any
of
the
other
shore
owners
the
others
had
been
worried
about
expenses
and
anxious
lest
the
draining
should
not
prove
any
more
successful
this
time
than
it
was
the
last
per
ola
father
knew
in
his
heart
that
it
was
he
who
had
influenced
them
to
undertake
the
work
he
had
exercised
all
his
eloquence
so
that
he
might
leave
to
his
son
a
farm
as
large
again
as
his
father
had
left
to
him
he
stood
and
pondered
if
god
hand
was
back
of
the
fact
that
takern
had
taken
his
son
from
him
on
the
day
before
he
was
to
draw
up
the
contract
to
lay
it
waste
the
wife
did
have
to
say
many
words
to
him
before
he
answered
it
may
be
that
god
does
not
want
us
to
interfere
with
his
order
i
talk
with
the
others
about
this
and
i
think
conclude
that
all
may
remain
as
it
is
while
the
were
talking
this
over
caesar
lay
before
the
fire
he
raised
his
head
and
listened
very
attentively
when
he
thought
that
he
was
sure
of
the
outcome
he
walked
up
to
the
mistress
took
her
by
the
skirt
and
led
her
to
the
door
but
caesar
said
she
and
wanted
to
break
loose
do
you
know
where
per
ola
is
she
exclaimed
caesar
barked
joyfully
and
threw
himself
against
the
door
she
opened
it
and
caesar
dashed
down
toward
takern
the
mistress
was
so
positive
he
knew
where
per
ola
was
that
she
rushed
after
him
and
no
sooner
had
they
reached
the
shore
than
they
heard
a
child
cry
out
on
the
lake
per
ola
had
had
the
best
day
of
his
life
in
company
with
thumbietot
and
the
birds
but
now
he
had
begun
to
cry
because
he
was
hungry
and
afraid
of
the
darkness
and
he
was
glad
when
father
and
mother
and
caesar
came
for
him
the
prophecy
april
one
night
when
the
boy
lay
and
slept
on
an
island
in
takern
he
was
awakened
by
he
had
hardly
gotten
his
eyes
open
before
there
fell
such
a
dazzling
light
on
them
that
he
began
to
blink
at
first
he
could
make
out
what
it
was
that
shone
so
brightly
out
here
on
the
lake
but
he
soon
saw
that
a
scow
with
a
big
burning
torch
stuck
up
on
a
spike
aft
lay
near
the
edge
of
the
reeds
the
red
flame
from
the
torch
was
clearly
reflected
in
the
lake
and
the
brilliant
light
must
have
lured
the
fish
for
round
about
the
flame
in
the
deep
a
mass
of
dark
specks
were
seen
that
moved
continually
and
changed
places
there
were
two
old
men
in
the
scow
one
sat
at
the
oars
and
the
other
stood
on
a
bench
in
the
stern
and
held
in
his
hand
a
short
spear
which
was
coarsely
barbed
the
one
who
rowed
was
apparently
a
poor
fisherman
he
was
small
and
and
wore
a
thin
threadbare
coat
one
could
see
that
he
was
so
used
to
being
out
in
all
sorts
of
weather
that
he
did
mind
the
cold
the
other
was
well
fed
and
well
dressed
and
looked
like
a
prosperous
and
farmer
now
stop
said
the
farmer
when
they
were
opposite
the
island
where
the
boy
lay
at
the
same
time
he
plunged
the
spear
into
the
water
when
he
drew
it
out
again
a
long
fine
eel
came
with
it
look
at
that
said
he
as
he
released
the
eel
from
the
spear
that
was
one
who
was
worth
while
now
i
think
we
have
so
many
that
we
can
turn
back
his
comrade
did
not
lift
the
oars
but
sat
and
looked
around
it
is
lovely
out
here
on
the
lake
said
he
and
so
it
was
it
was
absolutely
still
so
that
the
entire
lay
in
undisturbed
rest
with
the
exception
of
the
streak
where
the
boat
had
gone
forward
this
lay
like
a
path
of
gold
and
shimmered
in
the
firelight
the
sky
was
clear
and
dark
blue
and
thickly
studded
with
stars
the
shores
were
hidden
by
the
reed
islands
except
toward
the
west
there
mount
omberg
loomed
up
high
and
dark
much
more
impressive
than
usual
and
cut
away
a
big
piece
of
the
vaulted
heavens
the
other
one
turned
his
head
to
get
the
light
out
of
his
eyes
and
looked
about
him
yes
it
is
lovely
here
in
östergylln
said
he
still
the
best
thing
about
the
province
is
not
its
beauty
then
what
is
it
that
best
asked
the
oarsman
that
it
has
always
been
a
respected
and
honoured
province
that
may
be
true
enough
and
then
this
that
one
knows
it
will
always
continue
to
be
so
but
how
in
the
world
can
one
know
this
said
the
one
who
sat
at
the
oars
the
farmer
straightened
up
where
he
stood
and
braced
himself
with
the
spear
there
is
an
old
story
which
has
been
handed
down
from
father
to
son
in
my
family
and
in
it
one
learns
what
will
happen
to
östergötland
then
you
may
as
well
tell
it
to
me
said
the
oarsman
we
do
not
tell
it
to
anyone
and
everyone
but
i
do
not
wish
to
keep
it
a
secret
from
an
old
comrade
at
ulvåsa
here
in
östergötland
he
continued
and
one
could
tell
by
the
tone
of
his
voice
that
he
talked
of
something
which
he
had
heard
from
others
and
knew
by
heart
many
many
years
ago
there
lived
a
lady
who
had
the
gift
of
looking
into
the
future
and
telling
people
what
was
going
to
happen
to
them
just
as
certainly
and
accurately
as
though
it
had
already
occurred
for
this
she
became
widely
noted
and
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
people
would
come
to
her
both
from
far
and
near
to
find
out
what
they
were
going
to
pass
through
of
good
or
evil
one
day
when
sat
in
her
hall
and
spun
as
was
customary
in
former
days
a
poor
peasant
came
into
the
room
and
seated
himself
on
the
bench
near
the
door
wonder
what
you
are
sitting
and
thinking
about
dear
lady
said
the
peasant
after
a
little
am
sitting
and
thinking
about
high
and
holy
things
answered
she
it
is
not
fitting
perhaps
that
i
ask
you
about
something
which
weighs
on
my
heart
said
the
peasant
is
probably
nothing
else
that
weighs
on
your
heart
than
that
you
may
reap
much
grain
on
your
field
but
i
am
accustomed
to
receive
communications
from
the
emperor
about
how
it
will
go
with
his
crown
and
from
the
pope
about
how
it
will
go
with
his
keys
things
can
not
be
easy
to
answer
said
the
peasant
have
also
heard
that
no
one
seems
to
go
from
here
without
being
dissatisfied
with
what
he
has
heard
when
the
peasant
said
this
he
saw
that
bit
her
lip
and
moved
higher
up
on
the
bench
this
is
what
you
have
heard
about
me
said
she
you
may
as
well
tempt
fortune
by
asking
me
about
the
thing
you
wish
to
know
and
you
shall
see
if
i
can
answer
so
that
you
will
be
satisfied
after
this
the
peasant
did
not
hesitate
to
state
his
errand
he
said
that
he
had
come
to
ask
how
it
would
go
with
östergötland
in
the
future
there
was
nothing
which
was
so
dear
to
him
as
his
native
province
and
he
felt
that
he
should
be
happy
until
his
dying
day
if
he
could
get
a
satisfactory
reply
to
his
query
is
that
all
you
wish
to
know
said
the
wise
lady
i
think
that
you
will
be
content
for
here
where
i
now
sit
i
can
tell
you
that
it
will
be
like
this
with
östergötland
it
will
always
have
something
to
boast
of
ahead
of
other
provinces
that
was
a
good
answer
dear
lady
said
the
peasant
now
i
would
be
entirely
at
peace
if
i
could
only
comprehend
how
such
a
thing
should
be
possible
should
it
not
be
possible
said
you
know
that
östergötland
is
already
renowned
or
think
you
there
is
any
place
in
sweden
that
can
boast
of
owning
at
the
same
time
two
such
cloisters
as
the
ones
in
alvastra
and
vreta
and
such
a
beautiful
cathedral
as
the
one
in
linköping
may
be
so
said
the
peasant
i
an
old
man
and
i
know
that
people
minds
are
changeable
i
fear
that
there
will
come
a
time
when
they
wo
want
to
give
us
any
glory
either
for
alvastra
or
vreta
or
for
the
cathedral
you
may
be
right
said
you
need
not
doubt
prophecy
on
that
account
i
shall
now
build
up
a
new
cloister
on
vadstena
and
that
will
become
the
most
celebrated
in
the
north
thither
both
the
high
and
the
lowly
shall
make
pilgrimages
and
all
shall
sing
the
praises
of
the
province
because
it
has
such
a
holy
place
within
its
confines
the
peasant
replied
that
he
was
right
glad
to
know
this
but
he
also
knew
of
course
that
everything
was
perishable
and
he
wondered
much
what
would
give
distinction
to
the
province
if
vadstena
cloister
should
once
fall
into
disrepute
are
not
easy
to
satisfy
said
surely
i
can
see
so
far
ahead
that
i
can
tell
you
before
vadstena
cloister
shall
have
lost
its
splendour
there
will
be
a
castle
erected
close
by
which
will
be
the
most
magnificent
of
its
period
kings
and
dukes
will
be
guests
there
and
it
shall
be
accounted
an
honour
to
the
whole
province
that
it
owns
such
an
ornament
i
am
also
glad
to
hear
said
the
peasant
i
an
old
man
and
i
know
how
it
generally
turns
out
with
this
world
glories
and
if
the
castle
goes
to
ruin
i
wonder
much
what
there
will
be
that
can
attract
the
people
attention
to
this
province
not
a
little
that
you
want
to
know
said
certainly
i
can
look
far
enough
into
the
future
to
see
that
there
will
be
life
and
movement
in
the
forests
around
finspång
i
see
how
cabins
and
smithies
arise
there
and
i
believe
that
the
whole
province
shall
be
renowned
because
iron
will
be
moulded
within
its
confines
the
peasant
did
deny
that
he
was
delighted
to
hear
this
if
it
should
go
so
badly
that
even
finspång
foundry
went
down
in
importance
then
it
would
hardly
be
possible
that
any
new
thing
could
arise
of
which
östergötland
might
boast
are
not
easy
to
please
said
i
can
see
so
far
into
the
future
that
i
mark
how
along
the
great
manors
large
as
castles
are
built
by
gentlemen
who
have
carried
on
wars
in
foreign
lands
i
believe
that
the
manors
will
bring
the
province
just
as
much
honour
as
anything
else
that
i
have
mentioned
if
there
comes
a
time
when
no
one
lauds
the
great
manors
insisted
the
peasant
need
not
be
uneasy
at
all
events
said
i
see
how
bubble
on
medevi
meadows
by
vätter
shores
i
believe
that
the
wells
at
medevi
will
bring
the
land
as
much
praise
as
you
can
desire
is
a
mighty
good
thing
to
know
said
the
peasant
if
there
comes
a
time
when
people
will
seek
their
health
at
other
springs
must
not
give
yourself
any
anxiety
on
that
account
answered
i
see
how
people
dig
and
labour
from
motala
to
mem
they
dig
a
canal
right
through
the
country
and
then
östergötland
praise
is
again
on
everyone
lips
but
nevertheless
the
peasant
looked
distraught
see
that
the
rapids
in
motala
stream
begin
to
draw
wheels
said
and
now
two
bright
red
spots
came
to
her
cheeks
for
she
began
to
be
impatient
hear
hammers
resound
in
motala
and
looms
clatter
in
norrköping
that
good
to
know
said
the
peasant
everything
is
perishable
and
i
afraid
that
even
this
can
be
forgotten
and
go
into
oblivion
when
the
peasant
was
not
satisfied
even
now
there
was
an
end
to
the
lady
patience
say
that
everything
is
perishable
said
she
now
i
shall
still
name
something
which
will
always
be
like
itself
and
that
is
that
such
arrogant
and
peasants
as
you
will
always
be
found
in
this
province
until
the
end
of
time
hardly
had
said
this
before
the
peasant
rose
happy
and
satisfied
and
thanked
her
for
a
good
answer
now
at
last
he
was
satisfied
he
said
i
understand
now
how
you
look
at
it
then
said
i
look
at
it
in
this
way
dear
lady
said
the
peasant
everything
which
kings
and
priests
and
noblemen
and
merchants
build
and
accomplish
can
only
endure
for
a
few
years
but
when
you
tell
me
that
in
östergötland
there
will
always
be
peasants
who
are
and
persevering
then
i
know
also
that
it
will
be
able
to
keep
its
ancient
glory
for
it
is
only
those
who
go
bent
under
the
eternal
labour
with
the
soil
who
can
hold
this
land
in
good
repute
and
honour
from
one
time
to
another
the
homespun
cloth
april
the
boy
rode
forward
way
up
in
the
air
he
had
the
great
östergötland
plain
under
him
and
sat
and
counted
the
many
white
churches
which
towered
above
the
small
leafy
groves
around
them
it
was
long
before
he
had
counted
fifty
after
that
he
became
confused
and
could
keep
track
of
the
counting
nearly
all
the
farms
were
built
up
with
large
whitewashed
houses
which
looked
so
imposing
that
the
boy
could
help
admiring
them
there
ca
be
any
peasants
in
this
land
he
said
to
himself
since
i
do
not
see
any
peasant
farms
immediately
all
the
wild
geese
shrieked
here
the
peasants
live
like
gentlemen
here
the
peasants
live
like
gentlemen
on
the
plains
the
ice
and
snow
had
disappeared
and
the
spring
work
had
begun
what
kind
of
long
crabs
are
those
that
creep
over
the
fields
asked
the
boy
after
a
bit
ploughs
and
oxen
ploughs
and
oxen
answered
the
wild
geese
the
oxen
moved
so
slowly
down
on
the
fields
that
one
could
scarcely
perceive
they
were
in
motion
and
the
geese
shouted
to
them
you
get
there
before
next
year
you
wo
get
there
before
next
year
but
the
oxen
were
equal
to
the
occasion
they
raised
their
muzzles
in
the
air
and
bellowed
we
do
more
good
in
an
hour
than
such
as
you
do
in
a
whole
lifetime
in
a
few
places
the
ploughs
were
drawn
by
horses
they
went
along
with
much
more
eagerness
and
haste
than
the
oxen
but
the
geese
could
keep
from
teasing
these
either
you
ashamed
to
be
doing
cried
the
wild
geese
you
ashamed
yourselves
to
be
doing
lazy
man
duty
the
horses
neighed
back
at
them
but
while
horses
and
oxen
were
at
work
in
the
fields
the
stable
ram
walked
about
in
the
barnyard
he
was
newly
clipped
and
touchy
knocked
over
the
small
boys
chased
the
shepherd
dog
into
his
kennel
and
then
strutted
about
as
though
he
alone
were
lord
of
the
whole
place
rammie
rammie
what
have
you
done
with
your
wool
asked
the
wild
geese
who
rode
by
up
in
the
air
that
i
have
sent
to
drag
woollen
mills
in
norrköping
replied
the
ram
with
a
long
bleat
rammie
rammie
what
have
you
done
with
your
horns
asked
the
geese
but
any
horns
the
rammie
had
never
possessed
to
his
sorrow
and
one
offer
him
a
greater
insult
than
to
ask
after
them
he
ran
around
a
long
time
and
butted
at
the
air
so
furious
was
he
on
the
country
road
came
a
man
who
drove
a
flock
of
skåne
pigs
that
were
not
more
than
a
few
weeks
old
and
were
going
to
be
sold
up
country
they
trotted
along
bravely
as
little
as
they
were
and
kept
close
together
as
if
they
sought
protection
nuff
nuff
nuff
we
came
away
too
soon
from
father
and
mother
nuff
nuff
nuff
how
will
it
go
with
us
poor
children
said
the
little
pigs
the
wild
geese
did
have
the
heart
to
tease
such
poor
little
creatures
it
will
be
better
for
you
than
you
can
ever
believe
they
cried
as
they
flew
past
them
the
wild
geese
were
never
so
merry
as
when
they
flew
over
a
flat
country
then
they
did
not
hurry
themselves
but
flew
from
farm
to
farm
and
joked
with
the
tame
animals
as
the
boy
rode
over
the
plain
he
happened
to
think
of
a
legend
which
he
had
heard
a
long
time
ago
he
did
remember
it
exactly
but
it
was
something
about
a
petticoat
half
of
which
was
made
of
velvet
and
half
of
gray
homespun
cloth
but
the
one
who
owned
the
petticoat
adorned
the
homespun
cloth
with
such
a
lot
of
pearls
and
precious
stones
that
it
looked
richer
and
more
gorgeous
than
the
he
remembered
this
about
the
homespun
cloth
as
he
looked
down
on
östergötland
because
it
was
made
up
of
a
large
plain
which
lay
wedged
in
between
two
mountainous
one
to
the
north
the
other
to
the
south
the
two
lay
there
a
lovely
blue
and
shimmered
in
the
morning
light
as
if
they
were
decked
with
golden
veils
and
the
plain
which
simply
spread
out
one
field
after
another
was
in
and
of
itself
prettier
to
look
upon
than
gray
homespun
but
the
people
must
have
been
contented
on
the
plain
because
it
was
generous
and
kind
and
they
had
tried
to
decorate
it
in
the
best
way
possible
high
up
where
the
boy
rode
by
he
thought
that
cities
and
farms
churches
and
factories
castles
and
railway
stations
were
scattered
over
it
like
large
and
small
trinkets
it
shone
on
the
roofs
and
the
glittered
like
jewels
yellow
country
roads
shining
and
blue
canals
ran
along
between
the
districts
like
embroidered
loops
linköping
lay
around
its
cathedral
like
a
around
a
precious
stone
and
the
gardens
in
the
country
were
like
little
brooches
and
buttons
there
was
not
much
regulation
in
the
pattern
but
it
was
a
display
of
grandeur
which
one
could
never
tire
of
looking
at
the
geese
had
left
öberg
district
and
travelled
toward
the
east
along
göta
canal
this
was
also
getting
itself
ready
for
the
summer
workmen
laid
and
tarred
the
huge
they
were
working
everywhere
to
receive
spring
fittingly
even
in
the
cities
there
masons
and
painters
stood
on
scaffoldings
and
made
fine
the
exteriors
of
the
houses
while
maids
were
cleaning
the
windows
down
at
the
harbour
sailboats
and
steamers
were
being
washed
and
dressed
up
at
norrköping
the
wild
geese
left
the
plain
and
flew
up
toward
kolmården
for
a
time
they
had
followed
an
old
hilly
country
road
which
wound
around
cliffs
and
ran
forward
under
wild
when
the
boy
suddenly
let
out
a
shriek
he
had
been
sitting
and
swinging
his
foot
back
and
forth
and
one
of
his
wooden
shoes
had
slipped
off
i
have
dropped
my
shoe
cried
the
boy
the
turned
about
and
sank
toward
the
ground
then
the
boy
saw
that
two
children
who
were
walking
along
the
road
had
picked
up
his
shoe
screamed
the
boy
excitedly
fly
upward
again
it
is
too
late
i
can
not
get
my
shoe
back
again
down
on
the
road
stood
osa
the
and
her
brother
little
mats
looking
at
a
tiny
wooden
shoe
that
had
fallen
from
the
skies
osa
the
stood
silent
a
long
while
and
pondered
over
the
find
at
last
she
said
slowly
and
thoughtfully
do
you
remember
little
mats
that
when
we
went
past
övid
cloister
we
heard
that
the
folks
in
a
farmyard
had
seen
an
elf
who
was
dressed
in
leather
breeches
and
had
wooden
shoes
on
his
feet
like
any
other
working
man
and
do
you
recollect
when
we
came
to
vittskövle
a
girl
told
us
that
she
had
seen
a
with
wooden
shoes
who
flew
away
on
the
back
of
a
goose
and
when
we
ourselves
came
home
to
our
cabin
little
mats
we
saw
a
goblin
who
was
dressed
in
the
same
way
and
who
also
straddled
the
back
of
a
goose
and
flew
away
maybe
it
was
the
same
one
who
rode
along
on
his
goose
up
here
in
the
air
and
dropped
his
wooden
shoe
yes
it
must
have
been
said
little
mats
they
turned
the
wooden
shoe
about
and
examined
it
carefully
for
it
is
every
day
that
one
happens
across
a
wooden
shoe
on
the
highway
wait
wait
little
mats
said
osa
the
there
is
something
written
on
one
side
of
it
why
so
there
is
but
they
are
such
tiny
letters
let
me
see
it
says
it
says
holgersson
from
w
vemminghög
that
the
most
wonderful
thing
i
ever
heard
said
little
mats
the
story
of
karr
and
grayskin
karr
about
twelve
years
before
nils
holgersson
started
on
his
travels
with
the
wild
geese
there
was
a
manufacturer
at
kolmården
who
wanted
to
be
rid
of
one
of
his
dogs
he
sent
for
his
and
said
to
him
that
it
was
impossible
to
keep
the
dog
because
he
could
not
be
broken
of
the
habit
of
chasing
all
the
sheep
and
fowl
he
set
eyes
on
and
he
asked
the
man
to
take
the
dog
into
the
forest
and
shoot
him
the
slipped
the
leash
on
the
dog
to
lead
him
to
a
spot
in
the
forest
where
all
the
superannuated
dogs
from
the
manor
were
shot
and
buried
he
was
not
a
cruel
man
but
he
was
very
glad
to
shoot
that
dog
for
he
knew
that
sheep
and
chickens
were
not
the
only
creatures
he
hunted
times
without
number
he
had
gone
into
the
forest
and
helped
himself
to
a
hare
or
a
the
dog
was
a
little
setter
his
name
was
karr
and
he
was
so
wise
he
understood
all
that
was
said
as
the
was
leading
him
through
the
thickets
karr
knew
only
too
well
what
was
in
store
for
him
but
this
no
one
could
have
guessed
by
his
behaviour
for
he
neither
hung
his
head
nor
dragged
his
tail
but
seemed
as
unconcerned
as
ever
it
was
because
they
were
in
the
forest
that
the
dog
was
so
careful
not
to
appear
the
least
bit
anxious
there
were
great
stretches
of
woodland
on
every
side
of
the
factory
and
this
forest
was
famed
both
among
animals
and
human
beings
because
for
many
many
years
the
owners
had
been
so
careful
of
it
that
they
had
begrudged
themselves
even
the
trees
needed
for
firewood
nor
had
they
had
the
heart
to
thin
or
train
them
the
trees
had
been
allowed
to
grow
as
they
pleased
naturally
a
forest
thus
protected
was
a
beloved
refuge
for
wild
animals
which
were
to
be
found
there
in
great
numbers
among
themselves
they
called
it
liberty
forest
and
regarded
it
as
the
best
retreat
in
the
whole
country
as
the
dog
was
being
led
through
the
woods
he
thought
of
what
a
bugaboo
he
had
been
to
all
the
small
animals
and
birds
that
lived
there
now
karr
would
they
be
happy
in
their
lairs
if
they
only
knew
what
was
awaiting
you
he
thought
but
at
the
same
time
he
wagged
his
tail
and
barked
cheerfully
so
that
no
one
should
think
that
he
was
worried
or
depressed
what
fun
would
there
have
been
in
living
had
i
not
hunted
occasionally
he
reasoned
let
him
who
will
regret
it
not
going
to
be
karr
but
the
instant
the
dog
said
this
a
singular
change
came
over
him
he
stretched
his
neck
as
though
he
had
a
mind
to
howl
he
no
longer
trotted
alongside
the
but
walked
behind
him
it
was
plain
that
he
had
begun
to
think
of
something
unpleasant
it
was
early
summer
the
elk
cows
had
just
given
birth
to
their
young
and
the
night
before
the
dog
had
succeeded
in
parting
from
its
mother
an
elk
calf
not
more
than
five
days
old
and
had
driven
it
down
into
the
marsh
there
he
had
chased
it
back
and
forth
over
the
knolls
not
with
the
idea
of
capturing
it
but
merely
for
the
sport
of
seeing
how
he
could
scare
it
the
elk
cow
knew
that
the
marsh
was
bottomless
so
soon
after
the
thaw
and
that
it
could
not
as
yet
hold
up
so
large
an
animal
as
herself
so
she
stood
on
the
solid
earth
for
the
longest
time
watching
but
when
karr
kept
chasing
the
calf
farther
and
farther
away
she
rushed
out
on
the
marsh
drove
the
dog
off
took
the
calf
with
her
and
turned
back
toward
firm
land
elk
are
more
skilled
than
other
animals
in
traversing
dangerous
marshy
ground
and
it
seemed
as
if
she
would
reach
solid
land
in
safety
but
when
she
was
almost
there
a
knoll
which
she
had
stepped
upon
sank
into
the
mire
and
she
went
down
with
it
she
tried
to
rise
but
could
get
no
secure
foothold
so
she
sank
and
sank
karr
stood
and
looked
on
not
daring
to
move
when
he
saw
that
the
elk
could
not
save
herself
he
ran
away
as
fast
as
he
could
for
he
had
begun
to
think
of
the
beating
he
would
get
if
it
were
discovered
that
he
had
brought
a
mother
elk
to
grief
he
was
so
terrified
that
he
dared
not
pause
for
breath
until
he
reached
home
it
was
this
that
the
dog
recalled
and
it
troubled
him
in
a
way
very
different
from
the
recollection
of
all
his
other
misdeeds
this
was
doubtless
because
he
had
not
really
meant
to
kill
either
the
elk
cow
or
her
calf
but
had
deprived
them
of
life
without
wishing
to
do
so
but
maybe
they
are
alive
yet
thought
the
dog
they
were
not
dead
when
i
ran
away
perhaps
they
saved
themselves
he
was
seized
with
an
irresistible
longing
to
know
for
a
certainty
while
yet
there
was
time
for
him
to
find
out
he
noticed
that
the
did
not
have
a
firm
hold
on
the
leash
so
he
made
a
sudden
spring
broke
loose
and
dashed
through
the
woods
down
to
the
marsh
with
such
speed
that
he
was
out
of
sight
before
the
had
time
to
level
his
gun
there
was
nothing
for
the
to
do
but
to
rush
after
him
when
he
got
to
the
marsh
he
found
the
dog
standing
upon
a
knoll
howling
with
all
his
might
the
man
thought
he
had
better
find
out
the
meaning
of
this
so
he
dropped
his
gun
and
crawled
out
over
the
marsh
on
hands
and
knees
he
had
not
gone
far
when
he
saw
an
elk
cow
lying
dead
in
the
quagmire
close
beside
her
lay
a
little
calf
it
was
still
alive
but
so
much
exhausted
that
it
could
not
move
karr
was
standing
beside
the
calf
now
bending
down
and
licking
it
now
howling
shrilly
for
help
the
raised
the
calf
and
began
to
drag
it
toward
land
when
the
dog
understood
that
the
calf
would
be
saved
he
was
wild
with
joy
he
jumped
round
and
round
the
licking
his
hands
and
barking
with
delight
the
man
carried
the
baby
elk
home
and
shut
it
up
in
a
calf
stall
in
the
cow
shed
then
he
got
help
to
drag
the
mother
elk
from
the
marsh
only
after
this
had
been
done
did
he
remember
that
he
was
to
shoot
karr
he
called
the
dog
to
him
and
again
took
him
into
the
forest
the
walked
straight
on
toward
the
dog
grave
but
all
the
while
he
seemed
to
be
thinking
deeply
suddenly
he
turned
and
walked
toward
the
manor
karr
had
been
trotting
along
quietly
but
when
the
turned
and
started
for
home
he
became
anxious
the
man
must
have
discovered
that
it
was
he
that
had
caused
the
death
of
the
elk
and
now
he
was
going
back
to
the
manor
to
be
thrashed
before
he
was
shot
to
be
beaten
was
worse
than
all
else
with
that
prospect
karr
could
no
longer
keep
up
his
spirits
but
hung
his
head
when
he
came
to
the
manor
he
did
not
look
up
but
pretended
that
he
knew
no
one
there
the
master
was
standing
on
the
stairs
leading
to
the
hall
when
the
came
forward
where
on
earth
did
that
dog
come
from
he
exclaimed
surely
it
be
karr
he
must
be
dead
this
long
time
then
the
man
began
to
tell
his
master
all
about
the
mother
elk
while
karr
made
himself
as
little
as
he
could
and
crouched
behind
the
legs
much
to
his
surprise
the
man
had
only
praise
for
him
he
said
it
was
plain
the
dog
knew
that
the
elk
were
in
distress
and
wished
to
save
them
you
may
do
as
you
like
but
i
ca
shoot
that
dog
declared
the
karr
raised
himself
and
pricked
up
his
ears
he
could
hardly
believe
that
he
heard
aright
although
he
did
not
want
to
show
how
anxious
he
had
been
he
could
help
whining
a
little
could
it
be
possible
that
his
life
was
to
be
spared
simply
because
he
had
felt
uneasy
about
the
elk
the
master
thought
that
karr
had
conducted
himself
well
but
as
he
did
not
want
the
dog
he
could
not
decide
at
once
what
should
be
done
with
him
if
you
will
take
charge
of
him
and
answer
for
his
good
behaviour
in
the
future
he
may
as
well
live
he
said
finally
this
the
was
only
too
glad
to
do
and
that
was
how
karr
came
to
move
to
the
lodge
grayskin
flight
from
the
day
that
karr
went
to
live
with
the
he
abandoned
entirely
his
forbidden
chase
in
the
forest
this
was
due
not
only
to
his
having
been
thoroughly
frightened
but
also
to
the
fact
that
he
did
not
wish
to
make
the
angry
at
him
ever
since
his
new
master
saved
his
life
the
dog
loved
him
above
everything
else
he
thought
only
of
following
him
and
watching
over
him
if
he
left
the
house
karr
would
run
ahead
to
make
sure
that
the
way
was
clear
and
if
he
sat
at
home
karr
would
lie
before
the
door
and
keep
a
close
watch
on
every
one
who
came
and
went
when
all
was
quiet
at
the
lodge
when
no
footsteps
were
heard
on
the
road
and
the
was
working
in
his
garden
karr
would
amuse
himself
playing
with
the
baby
elk
at
first
the
dog
had
no
desire
to
leave
his
master
even
for
a
moment
since
he
accompanied
him
everywhere
he
went
with
him
to
the
cow
shed
when
he
gave
the
elk
calf
its
milk
the
dog
would
sit
outside
the
stall
and
gaze
at
it
the
called
the
calf
grayskin
because
he
thought
it
did
not
merit
a
prettier
name
and
karr
agreed
with
him
on
that
point
every
time
the
dog
looked
at
it
he
thought
that
he
had
never
seen
anything
so
ugly
and
misshapen
as
the
baby
elk
with
its
long
shambly
legs
which
hung
down
from
the
body
like
loose
stilts
the
head
was
large
old
and
wrinkled
and
it
always
drooped
to
one
side
the
skin
lay
in
tucks
and
folds
as
if
the
animal
had
put
on
a
coat
that
had
not
been
made
for
him
always
doleful
and
discontented
curiously
enough
he
jumped
up
every
time
karr
appeared
as
if
glad
to
see
him
the
elk
calf
became
less
hopeful
from
day
to
day
did
not
grow
any
and
at
last
he
could
not
even
rise
when
he
saw
karr
then
the
dog
jumped
up
into
the
crib
to
greet
him
and
thereupon
a
light
kindled
in
the
eyes
of
the
poor
creature
as
if
a
cherished
longing
were
fulfilled
after
that
karr
visited
the
elk
calf
every
day
and
spent
many
hours
with
him
licking
his
coat
playing
and
racing
with
him
till
he
taught
him
a
little
of
everything
a
forest
animal
should
know
it
was
remarkable
that
from
the
time
karr
began
to
visit
the
elk
calf
in
his
stall
the
latter
seemed
more
contented
and
began
to
grow
after
he
was
fairly
started
he
grew
so
rapidly
that
in
a
couple
of
weeks
the
stall
could
no
longer
hold
him
and
he
had
to
be
moved
into
a
grove
when
he
had
been
in
the
grove
two
months
his
legs
were
so
long
that
he
could
step
over
the
fence
whenever
he
wished
then
the
lord
of
the
manor
gave
the
permission
to
put
up
a
higher
fence
and
to
allow
him
more
space
here
the
elk
lived
for
several
years
and
grew
up
into
a
strong
and
handsome
animal
karr
kept
him
company
as
often
as
he
could
but
now
it
was
no
longer
through
pity
for
a
great
friendship
had
sprung
up
between
the
two
the
elk
was
always
inclined
to
be
melancholy
listless
and
indifferent
but
karr
knew
how
to
make
him
playful
and
happy
grayskin
had
lived
for
five
summers
on
the
place
when
his
owner
received
a
letter
from
a
zoölogical
garden
abroad
asking
if
the
elk
might
be
purchased
the
master
was
pleased
with
the
proposal
the
was
distressed
but
had
not
the
power
to
say
no
so
it
was
decided
that
the
elk
should
be
sold
karr
soon
discovered
what
was
in
the
air
and
ran
over
to
the
elk
to
have
a
chat
with
him
the
dog
was
very
much
distressed
at
the
thought
of
losing
his
friend
but
the
elk
took
the
matter
calmly
and
seemed
neither
glad
nor
sorry
do
you
think
of
letting
them
send
you
away
without
offering
resistance
asked
karr
what
good
would
it
do
to
resist
asked
grayskin
i
should
prefer
to
remain
where
i
am
naturally
but
if
i
been
sold
i
shall
have
to
go
of
course
karr
looked
at
grayskin
and
measured
him
with
his
eyes
it
was
apparent
that
the
elk
was
not
yet
full
grown
he
did
not
have
the
broad
antlers
high
hump
and
long
mane
of
the
mature
elk
but
he
certainly
had
strength
enough
to
fight
for
his
freedom
one
can
see
that
he
has
been
in
captivity
all
his
life
thought
karr
but
said
nothing
karr
left
and
did
not
return
to
the
grove
till
long
past
midnight
by
that
time
he
knew
grayskin
would
be
awake
and
eating
his
breakfast
of
course
you
are
doing
right
grayskin
in
letting
them
take
you
away
remarked
karr
who
appeared
now
to
be
calm
and
satisfied
you
will
be
a
prisoner
in
a
large
park
and
will
have
no
responsibilities
it
seems
a
pity
that
you
must
leave
here
without
having
seen
the
forest
you
know
your
ancestors
have
a
saying
that
elk
are
one
with
the
forest
but
you
have
even
been
in
a
forest
grayskin
glanced
up
from
the
clover
which
he
stood
munching
indeed
i
should
love
to
see
the
forest
but
how
am
i
to
get
over
the
fence
he
said
with
his
usual
apathy
oh
that
is
difficult
for
one
who
has
such
short
legs
said
karr
the
elk
glanced
slyly
at
the
dog
who
jumped
the
fence
many
times
a
day
little
as
he
was
he
walked
over
to
the
fence
and
with
one
spring
he
was
on
the
other
side
without
knowing
how
it
happened
then
karr
and
grayskin
went
into
the
forest
it
was
a
beautiful
moonlight
night
in
late
summer
but
in
among
the
trees
it
was
dark
and
the
elk
walked
along
slowly
perhaps
we
had
better
turn
back
said
karr
you
who
have
never
before
tramped
the
wild
forest
might
easily
break
your
legs
grayskin
moved
more
rapidly
and
with
more
courage
karr
conducted
the
elk
to
a
part
of
the
forest
where
the
pines
grew
so
thickly
that
no
wind
could
penetrate
them
it
is
here
that
your
kind
are
in
the
habit
of
seeking
shelter
from
cold
and
storm
said
karr
here
they
stand
under
the
open
skies
all
winter
but
you
will
fare
much
better
where
you
are
going
for
you
will
stand
in
a
shed
with
a
roof
over
your
head
like
an
ox
grayskin
made
no
comment
but
stood
quietly
and
drank
in
the
strong
piney
air
have
you
anything
more
to
show
me
or
have
i
now
seen
the
whole
forest
he
asked
then
karr
went
with
him
to
a
big
marsh
and
showed
him
clods
and
quagmire
over
this
marsh
the
elk
take
flight
when
they
are
in
peril
said
karr
i
do
know
how
they
manage
it
but
large
and
heavy
as
they
are
they
can
walk
here
without
sinking
of
course
you
could
hold
yourself
up
on
such
dangerous
ground
but
then
there
is
no
occasion
for
you
to
do
so
for
you
will
never
be
hounded
by
hunters
grayskin
made
no
retort
but
with
a
leap
he
was
out
on
the
marsh
and
happy
when
he
felt
how
the
clods
rocked
under
him
he
dashed
across
the
marsh
and
came
back
again
to
karr
without
having
stepped
into
a
mudhole
have
we
seen
the
whole
forest
now
he
asked
no
not
yet
said
karr
he
next
conducted
the
elk
to
the
skirt
of
the
forest
where
fine
oaks
lindens
and
aspens
grew
here
your
kind
eat
leaves
and
bark
which
they
consider
the
choicest
of
food
but
you
will
probably
get
better
fare
abroad
grayskin
was
astonished
when
he
saw
the
enormous
spreading
like
a
great
canopy
above
him
he
ate
both
oak
leaves
and
aspen
bark
these
taste
deliciously
bitter
and
good
he
remarked
better
than
clover
then
was
it
well
that
you
should
taste
them
once
said
the
dog
thereupon
he
took
the
elk
down
to
a
little
forest
lake
the
water
was
as
smooth
as
a
mirror
and
reflected
the
shores
which
were
veiled
in
thin
light
mists
when
grayskin
saw
the
lake
he
stood
entranced
what
is
this
karr
he
asked
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
seen
a
lake
it
a
large
body
of
water
a
lake
said
karr
your
people
swim
across
it
from
shore
to
shore
one
could
hardly
expect
you
to
be
familiar
with
this
but
at
least
you
should
go
in
and
take
a
swim
karr
himself
plunged
into
the
water
for
a
swim
grayskin
stayed
back
on
the
shore
for
some
little
time
but
finally
followed
he
grew
breathless
with
delight
as
the
cool
water
stole
soothingly
around
his
body
he
wanted
it
over
his
back
too
so
went
farther
out
then
he
felt
that
the
water
could
hold
him
up
and
began
to
swim
he
swam
all
around
karr
ducking
and
snorting
perfectly
at
home
in
the
water
when
they
were
on
shore
again
the
dog
asked
if
they
had
not
better
go
home
now
it
a
long
time
until
morning
observed
grayskin
so
we
can
tramp
around
in
the
forest
a
little
longer
they
went
again
into
the
pine
wood
presently
they
came
to
an
open
glade
illuminated
by
the
moonlight
where
grass
and
flowers
shimmered
beneath
the
dew
some
large
animals
were
grazing
on
this
forest
meadow
an
elk
bull
several
elk
cows
and
a
number
of
elk
calves
when
grayskin
caught
sight
of
them
he
stopped
short
he
hardly
glanced
at
the
cows
or
the
young
ones
but
stared
at
the
old
bull
which
had
broad
antlers
with
many
taglets
a
high
hump
and
a
fur
piece
hanging
down
from
his
throat
what
kind
of
an
animal
is
that
asked
grayskin
in
wonderment
he
is
called
said
karr
and
he
is
your
kinsman
one
of
these
days
you
too
will
have
broad
antlers
like
those
and
just
such
a
mane
and
if
you
were
to
remain
in
the
forest
very
likely
you
also
would
have
a
herd
to
lead
if
he
is
my
kinsman
i
must
go
closer
and
have
a
look
at
him
said
grayskin
i
never
dreamed
that
an
animal
could
be
so
stately
grayskin
walked
over
to
the
elk
but
almost
immediately
he
came
back
to
karr
who
had
remained
at
the
edge
of
the
clearing
you
were
not
very
well
received
were
you
said
karr
i
told
him
that
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
run
across
any
of
my
kinsmen
and
asked
if
i
might
walk
with
them
on
their
meadow
but
they
drove
me
back
threatening
me
with
their
antlers
you
did
right
to
retreat
said
karr
a
young
elk
bull
with
only
a
taglet
crown
must
be
careful
about
fighting
with
an
old
elk
another
would
have
disgraced
his
name
in
the
whole
forest
by
retreating
without
resistance
but
such
things
need
worry
you
who
are
going
to
move
to
a
foreign
land
karr
had
barely
finished
speaking
when
grayskin
turned
and
walked
down
to
the
meadow
the
old
elk
came
toward
him
and
instantly
they
began
to
fight
their
antlers
met
and
clashed
and
grayskin
was
driven
backward
over
the
whole
meadow
apparently
he
did
not
know
how
to
make
use
of
his
strength
but
when
he
came
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
he
planted
his
feet
on
the
ground
pushed
hard
with
his
antlers
and
began
to
force
back
grayskin
fought
quietly
while
puffed
and
snorted
the
old
elk
in
his
turn
was
now
being
forced
backward
over
the
meadow
suddenly
a
loud
crash
was
heard
a
taglet
in
the
old
elk
antlers
had
snapped
he
tore
himself
loose
and
dashed
into
the
forest
karr
was
still
standing
at
the
forest
border
when
grayskin
came
along
now
that
you
have
seen
what
there
is
in
the
forest
said
karr
will
you
come
home
with
me
yes
it
about
time
observed
the
elk
both
were
silent
on
the
way
home
karr
sighed
several
times
as
if
he
was
disappointed
about
something
but
grayskin
stepped
along
his
head
in
the
air
and
seemed
delighted
over
the
adventure
he
walked
ahead
unhesitatingly
until
they
came
to
the
enclosure
there
he
paused
he
looked
in
at
the
narrow
pen
where
he
had
lived
up
till
now
saw
the
beaten
ground
the
stale
fodder
the
little
trough
where
he
had
drunk
water
and
the
dark
shed
in
which
he
had
slept
the
elk
are
one
with
the
forest
he
cried
then
he
threw
back
his
head
so
that
his
neck
rested
against
his
back
and
rushed
wildly
into
the
woods
helpless
the
in
a
pine
thicket
in
the
heart
of
liberty
forest
every
year
in
the
month
of
august
there
appeared
a
few
moths
of
the
kind
which
are
called
nun
moths
they
were
small
and
few
in
number
and
scarcely
any
one
noticed
them
when
they
had
fluttered
about
in
the
depth
of
the
forest
a
couple
of
nights
they
laid
a
few
thousand
eggs
on
the
branches
of
trees
and
shortly
afterward
dropped
lifeless
to
the
ground
when
spring
came
little
prickly
caterpillars
crawled
out
from
the
eggs
and
began
to
eat
the
pine
needles
they
had
good
appetites
but
they
never
seemed
to
do
the
trees
any
serious
harm
because
they
were
hotly
pursued
by
birds
it
was
seldom
that
more
than
a
few
hundred
caterpillars
escaped
the
pursuers
the
poor
things
that
lived
to
be
full
grown
crawled
up
on
the
branches
spun
white
webs
around
themselves
and
sat
for
a
couple
of
weeks
as
motionless
pupae
during
this
period
as
a
rule
more
than
half
of
them
were
abducted
if
a
hundred
nun
moths
came
forth
in
august
winged
and
perfect
it
was
reckoned
a
good
year
for
them
this
sort
of
uncertain
and
obscure
existence
did
the
moths
lead
for
many
years
in
liberty
forest
there
were
no
insect
folk
in
the
whole
country
that
were
so
scarce
and
they
would
have
remained
quite
harmless
and
powerless
had
they
not
most
unexpectedly
received
a
helper
this
fact
has
some
connection
with
grayskin
flight
from
the
paddock
grayskin
roamed
the
forest
that
he
might
become
more
familiar
with
the
place
late
in
the
afternoon
he
happened
to
squeeze
through
some
thickets
behind
a
clearing
where
the
soil
was
muddy
and
slimy
and
in
the
centre
of
it
was
a
murky
pool
this
open
space
was
encircled
by
tall
pines
almost
bare
from
age
and
miasmic
air
grayskin
was
displeased
with
the
place
and
would
have
left
it
at
once
had
he
not
caught
sight
of
some
bright
green
calla
leaves
which
grew
near
the
pool
as
he
bent
his
head
toward
the
calla
stalks
he
happened
to
disturb
a
big
black
snake
which
lay
sleeping
under
them
grayskin
had
heard
karr
speak
of
the
poisonous
adders
that
were
to
be
found
in
the
forest
so
when
the
snake
raised
its
head
shot
out
its
tongue
and
hissed
at
him
he
thought
he
had
encountered
an
awfully
dangerous
reptile
he
was
terrified
and
raising
his
foot
he
struck
so
hard
with
his
hoof
that
he
crushed
the
snake
head
then
away
he
ran
in
hot
haste
as
soon
as
grayskin
had
gone
another
snake
just
as
long
and
as
black
as
the
first
came
up
from
the
pool
it
crawled
over
to
the
dead
one
and
licked
the
poor
head
can
it
be
true
that
you
are
dead
old
harmless
hissed
the
snake
we
two
have
lived
together
so
many
years
we
two
have
been
so
happy
with
each
other
and
have
fared
so
well
here
in
the
swamp
that
we
have
lived
to
be
older
than
all
the
other
in
the
forest
this
is
the
worst
sorrow
that
could
have
befallen
me
the
snake
was
so
that
his
long
body
writhed
as
if
it
had
been
wounded
even
the
frogs
who
lived
in
constant
fear
of
him
were
sorry
for
him
what
a
wicked
creature
he
must
be
to
murder
a
poor
that
can
not
defend
itself
hissed
the
snake
he
certainly
deserves
a
severe
punishment
as
sure
as
my
name
is
helpless
and
i
the
oldest
in
the
whole
forest
i
be
avenged
i
shall
not
rest
until
that
elk
lies
as
dead
on
the
ground
as
my
poor
old
when
the
snake
had
made
this
vow
he
curled
up
into
a
hoop
and
began
to
ponder
one
can
hardly
imagine
anything
that
would
be
more
difficult
for
a
poor
than
to
wreak
vengeance
upon
a
big
strong
elk
and
old
helpless
pondered
day
and
night
without
finding
any
solution
one
night
as
he
lay
there
with
his
he
heard
a
slight
rustle
over
his
head
he
glanced
up
and
saw
a
few
light
nun
moths
playing
in
among
the
trees
he
followed
them
with
his
eyes
a
long
while
then
began
to
hiss
loudly
to
himself
apparently
pleased
with
the
thought
that
had
occurred
to
him
then
he
fell
asleep
the
next
morning
the
went
over
to
see
crawlie
the
adder
who
lived
in
a
stony
and
hilly
part
of
liberty
forest
he
told
him
all
about
the
death
of
the
old
and
begged
that
he
who
could
deal
such
deadly
thrusts
would
undertake
the
work
of
vengeance
but
crawlie
was
not
exactly
disposed
to
go
to
war
with
an
elk
if
i
were
to
attack
an
elk
said
the
adder
he
would
instantly
kill
me
old
harmless
is
dead
and
gone
and
we
ca
bring
her
back
to
life
so
why
should
i
rush
into
danger
on
her
account
when
the
got
this
reply
he
raised
his
head
a
whole
foot
from
the
ground
and
hissed
furiously
vish
vash
vish
vash
he
said
it
a
pity
that
you
who
have
been
blessed
with
such
weapons
of
defence
should
be
so
cowardly
that
you
do
dare
use
them
when
the
adder
heard
this
he
too
got
angry
crawl
away
old
helpless
he
hissed
the
poison
is
in
my
fangs
but
i
would
rather
spare
one
who
is
said
to
be
my
kinsman
but
the
did
not
move
from
the
spot
and
for
a
long
time
the
snakes
lay
there
hissing
abusive
epithets
at
each
other
when
crawlie
was
so
angry
that
he
could
hiss
but
could
only
dart
his
tongue
out
the
changed
the
subject
and
began
to
talk
in
a
very
different
tone
i
had
still
another
errand
crawlie
he
said
lowering
his
voice
to
a
mild
whisper
but
now
i
suppose
you
are
so
angry
that
you
would
care
to
help
me
if
you
do
ask
anything
foolish
of
me
i
shall
certainly
be
at
your
service
in
the
pine
trees
down
by
the
swamp
live
a
moth
folk
that
fly
around
all
night
i
know
all
about
them
remarked
crawlie
what
up
with
them
now
they
are
the
smallest
insect
family
in
the
forest
said
helpless
and
the
most
harmless
since
the
caterpillars
content
themselves
with
gnawing
only
pine
needles
yes
i
know
said
crawlie
i
afraid
those
moths
will
soon
be
exterminated
sighed
the
there
are
so
many
who
pick
off
the
caterpillars
in
the
spring
now
crawlie
began
to
understand
that
the
wanted
the
caterpillars
for
his
own
purpose
and
he
answered
pleasantly
do
you
wish
me
to
say
to
the
owls
that
they
are
to
leave
those
pine
tree
worms
in
peace
yes
it
would
be
well
if
you
who
have
some
authority
in
the
forest
should
do
this
said
helpless
i
might
also
drop
a
good
word
for
the
pine
needle
pickers
among
the
thrushes
volunteered
the
adder
i
will
gladly
serve
you
when
you
do
not
demand
anything
unreasonable
now
you
have
given
me
a
good
promise
crawlie
said
helpless
and
glad
that
i
came
to
you
the
nun
moths
one
morning
several
years
later
karr
lay
asleep
on
the
porch
it
was
in
the
early
summer
the
season
of
light
nights
and
it
was
as
bright
as
day
although
the
sun
was
not
yet
up
karr
was
awakened
by
some
one
calling
his
name
is
it
you
grayskin
he
asked
for
he
was
accustomed
to
the
nightly
visits
again
he
heard
the
call
then
he
recognized
voice
and
hastened
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
karr
heard
the
elk
footfalls
in
the
distance
as
he
dashed
into
the
thickest
pine
wood
and
straight
through
the
brush
following
no
trodden
path
karr
could
not
catch
up
with
him
and
he
had
great
difficulty
in
even
following
the
trail
karr
karri
came
the
cry
and
the
voice
was
certainly
grayskin
although
it
had
a
ring
now
which
the
dog
had
never
heard
before
i
coming
i
coming
the
dog
responded
where
are
you
karr
karr
do
you
see
how
it
falls
and
falls
said
grayskin
then
karr
noticed
that
the
pine
needles
kept
dropping
and
dropping
from
the
trees
like
a
steady
fall
of
rain
yes
i
see
how
it
falls
he
cried
and
ran
far
into
the
forest
in
search
of
the
elk
grayskin
kept
running
through
the
thickets
while
karr
was
about
to
lose
the
trail
again
karr
karr
roared
grayskin
ca
you
scent
that
peculiar
odour
in
the
forest
karr
stopped
and
sniffed
he
had
not
thought
of
it
before
but
now
he
remarked
that
the
pines
sent
forth
a
much
stronger
odour
than
usual
yes
i
catch
the
scent
he
said
he
did
not
stop
long
enough
to
find
out
the
cause
of
it
but
hurried
on
after
grayskin
the
elk
ran
ahead
with
such
speed
that
the
dog
could
not
catch
up
with
him
karr
karr
he
called
ca
you
hear
the
crunching
on
the
pines
now
his
tone
was
so
plaintive
it
would
have
melted
a
stone
karr
paused
to
listen
he
heard
a
faint
but
distinct
tap
tap
on
the
trees
it
sounded
like
the
ticking
of
a
watch
yes
i
hear
how
it
ticks
cried
karr
and
ran
no
farther
he
understood
that
the
elk
did
not
want
him
to
follow
but
to
take
notice
of
something
that
was
happening
in
the
forest
karr
was
standing
beneath
the
drooping
branches
of
a
great
pine
he
looked
carefully
at
it
the
needles
moved
he
went
closer
and
saw
a
mass
of
caterpillars
creeping
along
the
branches
gnawing
off
the
needles
every
branch
was
covered
with
them
the
crunch
crunch
in
the
trees
came
from
the
working
of
their
busy
little
jaws
needles
fell
to
the
ground
in
a
continuous
shower
and
from
the
poor
pines
there
came
such
a
strong
odour
that
the
dog
suffered
from
it
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
this
wondered
karr
it
too
bad
about
the
pretty
trees
soon
they
have
no
beauty
left
he
walked
from
tree
to
tree
trying
with
his
poor
eyesight
to
see
if
all
was
well
with
them
there
a
pine
they
have
touched
he
thought
but
they
had
taken
possession
of
it
too
and
here
a
birch
no
this
also
the
will
not
be
pleased
with
this
observed
karr
he
ran
deeper
into
the
thickets
to
learn
how
far
the
destruction
had
spread
wherever
he
went
he
heard
the
same
ticking
scented
the
same
odour
saw
the
same
needle
rain
there
was
no
need
of
his
pausing
to
investigate
he
understood
it
all
by
these
signs
the
little
caterpillars
were
everywhere
the
whole
forest
was
being
ravaged
by
them
all
of
a
sudden
he
came
to
a
tract
where
there
was
no
odour
and
where
all
was
still
here
the
end
of
their
domain
thought
the
dog
as
he
paused
and
glanced
about
but
here
it
was
even
worse
for
the
caterpillars
had
already
done
their
work
and
the
trees
were
needleless
they
were
like
the
dead
the
only
thing
that
covered
them
was
a
network
of
ragged
threads
which
the
caterpillars
had
spun
to
use
as
roads
and
bridges
in
there
among
the
dying
trees
grayskin
stood
waiting
for
karr
he
was
not
alone
with
him
were
four
old
elk
the
most
respected
in
the
forest
karr
knew
them
they
were
who
was
a
small
elk
but
had
a
larger
hump
than
the
others
who
was
the
most
dignified
of
the
elk
with
the
thick
coat
and
an
old
one
who
up
till
the
autumn
before
when
he
got
a
bullet
in
his
thigh
had
been
terribly
and
quarrelsome
what
in
the
world
is
happening
to
the
forest
karr
asked
when
he
came
up
to
the
elk
they
stood
with
lowered
heads
far
protruding
upper
lips
and
looked
puzzled
no
one
can
tell
answered
grayskin
this
insect
family
used
to
be
the
least
hurtful
of
any
in
the
forest
and
never
before
have
they
done
any
damage
but
these
last
few
years
they
have
been
multiplying
so
fast
that
now
it
appears
as
if
the
entire
forest
would
be
destroyed
yes
it
looks
bad
karr
agreed
but
i
see
that
the
wisest
animals
in
the
forest
have
come
together
to
hold
a
consultation
perhaps
you
have
already
found
some
remedy
when
the
dog
said
this
solemnly
raised
his
heavy
head
pricked
up
his
long
ears
and
spoke
we
have
summoned
you
hither
karr
that
we
may
learn
if
the
humans
know
of
this
desolation
no
said
karr
no
human
being
ever
comes
thus
far
into
the
forest
when
it
not
hunting
time
they
know
nothing
of
this
misfortune
then
said
we
who
have
lived
long
in
the
forest
do
not
think
that
we
can
fight
this
insect
pest
all
by
ourselves
after
this
there
will
be
no
peace
in
the
forest
put
in
but
we
ca
let
the
whole
liberty
forest
go
to
rack
and
ruin
protested
we
have
to
consult
the
humans
there
is
no
alternative
karr
understood
that
the
elk
had
difficulty
in
expressing
what
they
wished
to
say
and
he
tried
to
help
them
perhaps
you
want
me
to
let
the
people
know
the
conditions
here
he
suggested
all
the
old
elk
nodded
their
heads
it
most
unfortunate
that
we
are
obliged
to
ask
help
of
human
beings
but
we
have
no
choice
a
moment
later
karr
was
on
his
way
home
as
he
ran
ahead
deeply
distressed
over
all
that
he
had
heard
and
seen
a
big
black
approached
them
well
met
in
the
forest
hissed
the
well
met
again
snarled
karr
and
rushed
by
without
stopping
the
snake
turned
and
tried
to
catch
up
to
him
perhaps
that
creature
also
is
worried
about
the
forest
thought
karr
and
waited
immediately
the
snake
began
to
talk
about
the
great
disaster
there
will
be
an
end
of
peace
and
quiet
in
the
forest
when
human
beings
are
called
hither
said
the
snake
i
afraid
there
will
the
dog
agreed
but
the
oldest
forest
dwellers
know
what
they
about
he
added
i
think
i
know
a
better
plan
said
the
snake
if
i
can
get
the
reward
i
wish
are
you
not
the
one
whom
every
one
around
here
calls
old
helpless
said
the
dog
sneeringly
i
an
old
inhabitant
of
the
forest
said
the
snake
and
i
know
how
to
get
rid
of
such
plagues
if
you
clear
the
forest
of
that
pest
i
feel
sure
you
can
have
anything
you
ask
for
said
karr
the
snake
did
not
respond
to
this
until
he
had
crawled
under
a
tree
stump
where
he
was
well
protected
then
he
said
tell
grayskin
that
if
he
will
leave
liberty
forest
forever
and
go
far
north
where
no
oak
tree
grows
i
will
send
sickness
and
death
to
all
the
creeping
things
that
gnaw
the
pines
and
spruces
what
that
you
say
asked
karr
bristling
up
what
harm
has
grayskin
ever
done
you
he
has
slain
the
one
whom
i
loved
best
the
snake
declared
and
i
want
to
be
avenged
before
the
snake
had
finished
speaking
karr
made
a
dash
for
him
but
the
reptile
lay
safely
hidden
under
the
tree
stump
stay
where
you
are
karr
concluded
we
manage
to
drive
out
the
caterpillars
without
your
help
the
big
war
of
the
moths
the
following
spring
as
karr
was
dashing
through
the
forest
one
morning
he
heard
some
one
behind
him
calling
karr
karr
he
turned
and
saw
an
old
fox
standing
outside
his
lair
you
must
tell
me
if
the
humans
are
doing
anything
for
the
forest
said
the
fox
yes
you
may
be
sure
they
are
said
karr
they
are
working
as
hard
as
they
can
they
have
killed
off
all
my
kinsfolk
and
they
be
killing
me
next
protested
the
fox
but
they
shall
be
pardoned
for
that
if
only
they
save
the
forest
that
year
karr
never
ran
into
the
woods
without
some
animal
asking
if
the
humans
could
save
the
forest
it
was
not
easy
for
the
dog
to
answer
the
people
themselves
were
not
certain
that
they
could
conquer
the
moths
but
considering
how
feared
and
hated
old
kolmården
had
always
been
it
was
remarkable
that
every
day
more
than
a
hundred
men
went
there
to
work
they
cleared
away
the
underbrush
they
felled
dead
trees
lopped
off
branches
from
the
live
ones
so
that
the
caterpillars
could
not
easily
crawl
from
tree
to
tree
they
also
dug
wide
trenches
around
the
ravaged
parts
and
put
up
fences
to
keep
them
out
of
new
territory
then
they
painted
rings
of
lime
around
the
trunks
of
trees
to
prevent
the
caterpillars
leaving
those
they
had
already
stripped
the
idea
was
to
force
them
to
remain
where
they
were
until
they
starved
to
death
the
people
worked
with
the
forest
until
far
into
the
spring
they
were
hopeful
and
could
hardly
wait
for
the
caterpillars
to
come
out
from
their
eggs
feeling
certain
that
they
had
shut
them
in
so
effectually
that
most
of
them
would
die
of
starvation
but
in
the
early
summer
the
caterpillars
came
out
more
numerous
than
ever
they
were
everywhere
they
crawled
on
the
country
roads
on
fences
on
the
walls
of
the
cabins
they
wandered
outside
the
confines
of
liberty
forest
to
other
parts
of
kolmården
they
wo
stop
till
all
our
forests
are
destroyed
sighed
the
people
who
were
in
great
despair
and
could
not
enter
the
forest
without
weeping
karr
was
so
sick
of
the
sight
of
all
these
creeping
gnawing
things
that
he
could
hardly
bear
to
step
outside
the
door
but
one
day
he
felt
that
he
must
go
and
find
out
how
grayskin
was
getting
on
he
took
the
shortest
cut
to
the
elk
haunts
and
hurried
along
his
nose
close
to
the
earth
when
he
came
to
the
tree
stump
where
he
had
met
helpless
the
year
before
the
snake
was
still
there
and
called
to
him
have
you
told
grayskin
what
i
said
to
you
when
last
we
met
asked
the
karr
only
growled
and
tried
to
get
at
him
if
you
have
told
him
by
all
means
do
so
insisted
the
snake
you
must
see
that
the
humans
know
of
no
cure
for
this
plague
neither
do
you
retorted
the
dog
and
ran
on
karr
found
grayskin
but
the
elk
was
so
that
he
scarcely
greeted
the
dog
he
began
at
once
to
talk
of
the
forest
i
do
know
what
i
would
give
if
this
misery
were
only
at
an
end
he
said
now
i
shall
tell
you
that
is
said
you
could
save
the
forest
then
karr
delivered
the
message
if
any
one
but
helpless
had
promised
this
i
should
immediately
go
into
exile
declared
the
elk
but
how
can
a
poor
have
the
power
to
work
such
a
miracle
of
course
it
only
a
bluff
said
karr
always
like
to
pretend
that
they
know
more
than
other
creatures
when
karr
was
ready
to
go
home
grayskin
accompanied
him
part
of
the
way
presently
karr
heard
a
thrush
perched
on
a
pine
top
cry
there
goes
grayskin
who
has
destroyed
the
forest
there
goes
grayskin
who
has
destroyed
the
forest
karr
thought
that
he
had
not
heard
correctly
but
the
next
moment
a
hare
came
darting
across
the
path
when
the
hare
saw
them
he
stopped
flapped
his
ears
and
screamed
here
comes
grayskin
who
has
destroyed
the
forest
then
he
ran
as
fast
as
he
could
what
do
they
mean
by
that
asked
karr
i
really
do
know
said
grayskin
i
think
that
the
small
forest
animals
are
displeased
with
me
because
i
was
the
one
who
proposed
that
we
should
ask
help
of
human
beings
when
the
underbrush
was
cut
down
all
their
lairs
and
hiding
places
were
destroyed
they
walked
on
together
a
while
longer
and
karr
heard
the
same
cry
coming
from
all
directions
there
goes
grayskin
who
has
destroyed
the
forest
grayskin
pretended
not
to
hear
it
but
karr
understood
why
the
elk
was
so
downhearted
i
say
grayskin
what
does
the
mean
by
saying
you
killed
the
one
he
loved
best
how
can
i
tell
said
grayskin
you
know
very
well
that
i
never
kill
anything
shortly
after
that
they
met
the
four
old
elk
and
who
were
coming
along
slowly
one
after
the
other
well
met
in
the
forest
called
grayskin
well
met
in
turn
answered
the
elk
we
were
just
looking
for
you
grayskin
to
consult
with
you
about
the
forest
the
fact
is
began
we
have
been
informed
that
a
crime
has
been
committed
here
and
that
the
whole
forest
is
being
destroyed
because
the
criminal
has
not
been
punished
what
kind
of
a
crime
was
it
some
one
killed
a
harmless
creature
that
he
could
eat
such
an
act
is
accounted
a
crime
in
liberty
forest
who
could
have
done
such
a
cowardly
thing
wondered
grayskin
they
say
that
an
elk
did
it
and
we
were
just
going
to
ask
if
you
knew
who
it
was
no
said
grayskin
i
have
never
heard
of
an
elk
killing
a
harmless
creature
grayskin
parted
from
the
four
old
elk
and
went
on
with
karr
he
was
silent
and
walked
with
lowered
head
they
happened
to
pass
crawlie
the
adder
who
lay
on
his
shelf
of
rock
there
goes
grayskin
who
has
destroyed
the
whole
forest
hissed
crawlie
like
all
the
rest
by
that
time
grayskin
patience
was
exhausted
he
walked
up
to
the
snake
and
raised
a
forefoot
do
you
think
of
crushing
me
as
you
crushed
the
old
hissed
crawlie
did
i
kill
a
asked
grayskin
astonished
the
first
day
you
were
in
the
forest
you
killed
the
wife
of
poor
old
helpless
said
crawlie
grayskin
turned
quickly
from
the
adder
and
continued
his
walk
with
karr
suddenly
he
stopped
karr
it
was
i
who
committed
that
crime
i
killed
a
harmless
creature
therefore
it
is
on
my
account
that
the
forest
is
being
destroyed
what
are
you
saying
karr
interrupted
you
may
tell
the
helpless
that
grayskin
goes
into
exile
that
i
shall
never
tell
him
protested
karr
the
far
north
is
a
dangerous
country
for
elk
do
you
think
that
i
wish
to
remain
here
when
i
have
caused
a
disaster
like
this
protested
grayskin
do
be
rash
sleep
over
it
before
you
do
anything
it
was
you
who
taught
me
that
the
elk
are
one
with
the
forest
said
grayskin
and
so
saying
he
parted
from
karr
the
dog
went
home
alone
but
this
talk
with
grayskin
troubled
him
and
the
next
morning
he
returned
to
the
forest
to
seek
him
but
grayskin
was
not
to
be
found
and
the
dog
did
not
search
long
for
him
he
realized
that
the
elk
had
taken
the
snake
at
his
word
and
had
gone
into
exile
on
his
walk
home
karr
was
too
unhappy
for
words
he
could
not
understand
why
grayskin
should
allow
that
wretch
of
a
to
trick
him
away
he
had
never
heard
of
such
folly
what
power
can
that
old
helpless
have
as
karr
walked
along
his
mind
full
of
these
thoughts
he
happened
to
see
the
who
stood
pointing
up
at
a
tree
what
are
you
looking
at
asked
a
man
who
stood
beside
him
sickness
has
come
among
the
caterpillars
observed
the
karr
was
astonished
but
he
was
even
more
angered
at
the
snake
having
the
power
to
keep
his
word
grayskin
would
have
to
stay
away
a
long
long
time
for
of
course
that
would
never
die
at
the
very
height
of
his
grief
a
thought
came
to
karr
which
comforted
him
a
little
perhaps
the
wo
live
so
long
after
all
he
thought
surely
he
can
not
always
lie
protected
under
a
tree
root
as
soon
as
he
has
cleaned
out
the
caterpillars
i
know
some
one
who
is
going
to
bite
his
head
off
it
was
true
that
an
illness
had
made
its
appearance
among
the
caterpillars
the
first
summer
it
did
not
spread
much
it
had
only
just
broken
out
when
it
was
time
for
the
larvae
to
turn
into
pupae
from
the
latter
came
millions
of
moths
they
flew
around
in
the
trees
like
a
blinding
snowstorm
and
laid
countless
numbers
of
eggs
an
even
greater
destruction
was
prophesied
for
the
following
year
the
destruction
came
not
only
to
the
forest
but
also
to
the
caterpillars
the
sickness
spread
quickly
from
forest
to
forest
the
sick
caterpillars
stopped
eating
crawled
up
to
the
branches
of
the
trees
and
died
there
there
was
great
rejoicing
among
the
people
when
they
saw
them
die
but
there
was
even
greater
rejoicing
among
the
forest
animals
from
day
to
day
the
dog
karr
went
about
with
savage
glee
thinking
of
the
hour
when
he
might
venture
to
kill
helpless
but
the
caterpillars
meanwhile
had
spread
over
miles
of
pine
woods
not
in
one
summer
did
the
disease
reach
them
all
many
lived
to
become
pupas
and
moths
grayskin
sent
messages
to
his
friend
karr
by
the
birds
of
passage
to
say
that
he
was
alive
and
faring
well
but
the
birds
told
karr
confidentially
that
on
several
occasions
grayskin
had
been
pursued
by
poachers
and
that
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
had
he
escaped
karr
lived
in
a
state
of
continual
grief
yearning
and
anxiety
yet
he
had
to
wait
two
whole
summers
more
before
there
was
an
end
of
the
caterpillars
karr
no
sooner
heard
the
say
that
the
forest
was
out
of
danger
than
he
started
on
a
hunt
for
helpless
but
when
he
was
in
the
thick
of
the
forest
he
made
a
frightful
discovery
he
could
not
hunt
any
more
he
could
not
run
he
could
not
track
his
enemy
and
he
could
not
see
at
all
during
the
long
years
of
waiting
old
age
had
overtaken
karr
he
had
grown
old
without
having
noticed
it
he
had
not
the
strength
even
to
kill
a
he
was
not
able
to
save
his
friend
grayskin
from
his
enemy
retribution
one
afternoon
akka
from
kebnekaise
and
her
flock
alighted
on
the
shore
of
a
forest
lake
spring
was
backward
as
it
always
is
in
the
mountain
districts
ice
covered
all
the
lake
save
a
narrow
strip
next
the
land
the
geese
at
once
plunged
into
the
water
to
bathe
and
hunt
for
food
in
the
morning
nils
holgersson
had
dropped
one
of
his
wooden
shoes
so
he
went
down
by
the
elms
and
birches
that
grew
along
the
shore
to
look
for
something
to
bind
around
his
foot
the
boy
walked
quite
a
distance
before
he
found
anything
that
he
could
use
he
glanced
about
nervously
for
he
did
not
fancy
being
in
the
forest
give
me
the
plains
and
the
lakes
he
thought
there
you
can
see
what
you
are
likely
to
meet
now
if
this
were
a
grove
of
little
birches
it
would
be
well
enough
for
then
the
ground
would
be
almost
bare
but
how
people
can
like
these
wild
pathless
forests
is
incomprehensible
to
me
if
i
owned
this
land
i
would
chop
down
every
tree
at
last
he
caught
sight
of
a
piece
of
birch
bark
and
just
as
he
was
fitting
it
to
his
foot
he
heard
a
rustle
behind
him
he
turned
quickly
a
snake
darted
from
the
brush
straight
toward
him
the
snake
was
uncommonly
long
and
thick
but
the
boy
soon
saw
that
it
had
a
white
spot
on
each
cheek
why
it
only
a
he
laughed
it
ca
harm
me
but
the
next
instant
the
snake
gave
him
a
powerful
blow
on
the
chest
that
knocked
him
down
the
boy
was
on
his
feet
in
a
second
and
running
away
but
the
snake
was
after
him
the
ground
was
stony
and
scrubby
the
boy
could
not
proceed
very
fast
and
the
snake
was
close
at
his
heels
then
the
boy
saw
a
big
rock
in
front
of
him
and
began
to
scale
it
i
do
hope
the
snake
ca
follow
me
here
he
thought
but
he
had
no
sooner
reached
the
top
of
the
rock
than
he
saw
that
the
snake
was
following
him
quite
close
to
the
boy
on
a
narrow
ledge
at
the
top
of
the
rock
lay
a
round
stone
as
large
as
a
man
head
as
the
snake
came
closer
the
boy
ran
behind
the
stone
and
gave
it
a
push
it
rolled
right
down
on
the
snake
drawing
it
along
to
the
ground
where
it
landed
on
its
head
that
stone
did
its
work
well
thought
the
boy
with
a
sigh
of
relief
as
he
saw
the
snake
squirm
a
little
and
then
lie
perfectly
still
i
do
think
i
been
in
greater
peril
on
the
whole
journey
he
said
he
had
hardly
recovered
from
the
shock
when
he
heard
a
rustle
above
him
and
saw
a
bird
circling
through
the
air
to
light
on
the
ground
right
beside
the
snake
the
bird
was
like
a
crow
in
size
and
form
but
was
dressed
in
a
pretty
coat
of
shiny
black
feathers
the
boy
cautiously
retreated
into
a
crevice
of
the
rock
his
adventure
in
being
kidnapped
by
crows
was
still
fresh
in
his
memory
and
he
did
not
care
to
show
himself
when
there
was
no
need
of
it
the
bird
strode
back
and
forth
beside
the
snake
body
and
turned
it
over
with
his
beak
finally
he
spread
his
wings
and
began
to
shriek
in
tones
it
is
certainly
helpless
the
that
lies
dead
here
once
more
he
walked
the
length
of
the
snake
then
he
stood
in
a
deep
study
and
scratched
his
neck
with
his
foot
it
is
possible
that
there
can
be
two
such
big
snakes
in
the
forest
he
pondered
it
must
surely
be
helpless
he
was
just
going
to
thrust
his
beak
into
the
snake
but
suddenly
checked
himself
you
must
be
a
numbskull
bataki
he
remarked
to
himself
surely
you
can
not
be
thinking
of
eating
the
snake
until
you
have
called
karr
he
would
believe
that
helpless
was
dead
unless
he
could
see
it
with
his
own
eyes
the
boy
tried
to
keep
quiet
but
the
bird
was
so
ludicrously
solemn
as
he
stalked
back
and
forth
chattering
to
himself
that
he
had
to
laugh
the
bird
heard
him
and
with
a
flap
of
his
wings
he
was
up
on
the
rock
the
boy
rose
quickly
and
walked
toward
him
are
you
not
the
one
who
is
called
bataki
the
raven
and
are
you
not
a
friend
of
akka
from
kebnekaise
asked
the
boy
the
bird
regarded
him
intently
then
nodded
three
times
surely
you
not
the
little
chap
who
flies
around
with
the
wild
geese
and
whom
they
call
thumbietot
oh
you
not
so
far
out
of
the
way
said
the
boy
what
luck
that
i
should
have
run
across
you
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
who
killed
this
the
stone
which
i
rolled
down
on
him
killed
him
replied
the
boy
and
related
how
the
whole
thing
happened
that
was
cleverly
done
for
one
who
is
as
tiny
as
you
are
said
the
raven
i
have
a
friend
in
these
parts
who
will
be
glad
to
know
that
this
snake
has
been
killed
and
i
should
like
to
render
you
a
service
in
return
then
tell
me
why
you
are
glad
the
is
dead
responded
the
boy
it
a
long
story
said
the
raven
you
would
have
the
patience
to
listen
to
it
but
the
boy
insisted
that
he
had
and
then
the
raven
told
him
the
whole
story
about
karr
and
grayskin
and
helpless
the
when
he
had
finished
the
boy
sat
quietly
for
a
moment
looking
straight
ahead
then
he
spoke
i
seem
to
like
the
forest
better
since
hearing
this
i
wonder
if
there
is
anything
left
of
the
old
liberty
forest
most
of
it
has
been
destroyed
said
bataki
the
trees
look
as
if
they
had
passed
through
a
fire
they
have
to
be
cleared
away
and
it
will
take
many
years
before
the
forest
will
be
what
it
once
was
that
snake
deserved
his
death
declared
the
boy
but
i
wonder
if
it
could
be
possible
that
he
was
so
wise
he
could
send
sickness
to
the
caterpillars
perhaps
he
knew
that
they
frequently
became
sick
in
that
way
intimated
bataki
yes
that
may
be
but
all
the
same
i
must
say
that
he
was
a
very
wily
snake
the
boy
stopped
talking
because
he
saw
the
raven
was
not
listening
to
him
but
sitting
with
gaze
averted
hark
he
said
karr
is
in
the
vicinity
wo
he
be
happy
when
he
sees
that
helpless
is
dead
the
boy
turned
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
he
talking
with
the
wild
geese
he
said
oh
you
may
be
sure
that
he
has
dragged
himself
down
to
the
strand
to
get
the
latest
news
about
grayskin
both
the
boy
and
the
raven
jumped
to
the
ground
and
hastened
down
to
the
shore
all
the
geese
had
come
out
of
the
lake
and
stood
talking
with
an
old
dog
who
was
so
weak
and
decrepit
that
it
seemed
as
if
he
might
drop
dead
at
any
moment
there
karr
said
bataki
to
the
boy
let
him
hear
first
what
the
wild
geese
have
to
say
to
him
later
we
shall
tell
him
that
the
is
dead
presently
they
heard
akka
talking
to
karr
it
happened
last
year
while
we
were
making
our
usual
spring
trip
remarked
the
we
started
out
one
morning
yksi
kaksi
and
i
and
we
flew
over
the
great
boundary
forests
between
dalecarlia
and
hälsingland
under
us
we
saw
only
thick
pine
forests
the
snow
was
still
deep
among
the
trees
and
the
creeks
were
mostly
frozen
suddenly
we
noticed
three
poachers
down
in
the
forest
they
were
on
skis
had
dogs
in
leash
carried
knives
in
their
belts
but
had
no
guns
as
there
was
a
hard
crust
on
the
snow
they
did
not
bother
to
take
the
winding
forest
paths
but
skied
straight
ahead
apparently
they
knew
very
well
where
they
must
go
to
find
what
they
were
seeking
we
wild
geese
flew
on
high
up
in
the
air
so
that
the
whole
forest
under
us
was
visible
when
we
sighted
the
poachers
we
wanted
to
find
out
where
the
game
was
so
we
circled
up
and
down
peering
through
the
trees
then
in
a
dense
thicket
we
saw
something
that
looked
like
big
rocks
but
could
be
rocks
for
there
was
no
snow
on
them
we
shot
down
suddenly
and
lit
in
the
centre
of
the
thicket
the
three
rocks
moved
they
were
three
elk
a
bull
and
two
cows
resting
in
the
bleak
forest
when
we
alighted
the
elk
bull
rose
and
came
toward
us
he
was
the
most
superb
animal
we
had
ever
seen
when
he
saw
that
it
was
only
some
poor
wild
geese
that
had
awakened
him
he
lay
down
again
old
granddaddy
you
must
go
back
to
sleep
i
cried
as
fast
as
you
can
there
are
poachers
in
the
forest
and
they
are
bound
for
this
very
deer
fold
you
goose
mother
said
the
elk
he
seemed
to
be
dropping
to
sleep
while
he
was
speaking
surely
you
must
know
that
we
elk
are
under
the
protection
of
the
law
at
this
time
of
the
year
those
poachers
are
probably
out
for
fox
he
yawned
are
plenty
of
fox
trails
in
the
forest
but
the
poachers
are
not
looking
for
them
believe
me
old
granddaddy
they
know
that
you
are
lying
here
and
are
coming
to
attack
you
they
have
no
guns
with
them
only
spears
and
knives
for
they
dare
not
fire
a
shot
at
this
season
the
elk
bull
lay
there
calmly
but
the
elk
cows
seemed
to
feel
uneasy
may
be
as
the
geese
say
they
remarked
beginning
to
bestir
themselves
just
lie
down
said
the
elk
bull
are
no
poachers
coming
here
of
that
you
may
be
certain
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
so
we
wild
geese
rose
again
into
the
air
but
we
continued
to
circle
over
the
place
to
see
how
it
would
turn
out
for
the
elk
we
had
hardly
reached
our
regular
flying
altitude
when
we
saw
the
elk
bull
come
out
from
the
thicket
he
sniffed
the
air
a
little
then
walked
straight
toward
the
poachers
as
he
strode
along
he
stepped
upon
dry
twigs
that
crackled
noisily
a
big
barren
marsh
lay
just
beyond
him
thither
he
went
and
took
his
stand
in
the
middle
where
there
was
nothing
to
hide
him
from
view
there
he
stood
until
the
poachers
emerged
from
the
woods
then
he
turned
and
fled
in
the
opposite
direction
the
poachers
let
loose
the
dogs
and
they
themselves
skied
after
him
at
full
speed
the
elk
threw
back
his
head
and
loped
as
fast
as
he
could
he
kicked
up
snow
until
it
flew
like
a
blizzard
about
him
both
dogs
and
men
were
left
far
behind
then
the
elk
stopped
as
if
to
await
their
approach
when
they
were
within
sight
he
dashed
ahead
again
we
understood
that
he
was
purposely
tempting
the
hunters
away
from
the
place
where
the
cows
were
we
thought
it
brave
of
him
to
face
danger
himself
in
order
that
those
who
were
dear
to
him
might
be
left
in
safety
none
of
us
wanted
to
leave
the
place
until
we
had
seen
how
all
this
was
to
end
thus
the
chase
continued
for
two
hours
or
more
we
wondered
that
the
poachers
went
to
the
trouble
of
pursuing
the
elk
when
they
were
not
armed
with
rifles
they
could
have
thought
that
they
could
succeed
in
tiring
out
a
runner
like
him
then
we
noticed
that
the
elk
no
longer
ran
so
rapidly
he
stepped
on
the
snow
more
carefully
and
every
time
he
lifted
his
feet
blood
could
be
seen
in
his
tracks
we
understood
why
the
poachers
had
been
so
persistent
they
had
counted
on
help
from
the
snow
the
elk
was
heavy
and
with
every
step
he
sank
to
the
bottom
of
the
drift
the
hard
crust
on
the
snow
was
scraping
his
legs
it
scraped
away
the
fur
and
tore
out
pieces
of
flesh
so
that
he
was
in
torture
every
time
he
put
his
foot
down
the
poachers
and
the
dogs
who
were
so
light
that
the
ice
crust
could
hold
their
weight
pursued
him
all
the
while
he
ran
on
and
on
his
steps
becoming
more
and
more
uncertain
and
faltering
he
gasped
for
breath
not
only
did
he
suffer
intense
pain
but
he
was
also
exhausted
from
wading
through
the
deep
snowdrifts
at
last
he
lost
all
patience
he
paused
to
let
poachers
and
dogs
come
upon
him
and
was
ready
to
fight
them
as
he
stood
there
waiting
he
glanced
upward
when
he
saw
us
wild
geese
circling
above
him
he
cried
out
here
wild
geese
until
all
is
over
and
the
next
time
you
fly
over
kolmården
look
up
karr
and
ask
him
if
he
does
think
that
his
friend
grayskin
has
met
with
a
happy
end
when
akka
had
gone
so
far
in
her
story
the
old
dog
rose
and
walked
nearer
to
her
grayskin
led
a
good
life
he
said
he
understands
me
he
knows
that
i
a
brave
dog
and
that
i
shall
be
glad
to
hear
that
he
had
a
happy
end
now
tell
me
how
he
raised
his
tail
and
threw
back
his
head
as
if
to
give
himself
a
bold
and
proud
bearing
then
he
collapsed
karr
karr
called
a
man
voice
from
the
forest
the
old
dog
rose
obediently
my
master
is
calling
me
he
said
and
i
must
not
tarry
longer
i
just
saw
him
load
his
gun
now
we
two
are
going
into
the
forest
for
the
last
time
many
thanks
wild
goose
i
know
everything
that
i
need
know
to
die
content
the
wind
witch
in
närke
in
bygone
days
there
was
something
in
närke
the
like
of
which
was
not
to
be
found
elsewhere
it
was
a
witch
named
the
name
kaisa
had
been
given
her
because
she
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
wind
and
storm
and
these
wind
witches
are
always
so
called
the
surname
was
added
because
she
was
supposed
to
have
come
from
ysätter
swamp
in
asker
parish
it
seemed
as
though
her
real
abode
must
have
been
at
asker
but
she
used
also
to
appear
at
other
places
nowhere
in
all
närke
could
one
be
sure
of
not
meeting
her
she
was
no
dark
mournful
witch
but
gay
and
frolicsome
and
what
she
loved
most
of
all
was
a
gale
of
wind
as
soon
as
there
was
wind
enough
off
she
would
fly
to
the
närke
plain
for
a
good
dance
on
days
when
a
whirlwind
swept
the
plain
had
fun
she
would
stand
right
in
the
wind
and
spin
round
her
long
hair
flying
up
among
the
clouds
and
the
long
trail
of
her
robe
sweeping
the
ground
like
a
dust
cloud
while
the
whole
plain
lay
spread
out
under
her
like
a
ballroom
floor
of
a
morning
would
sit
up
in
some
tall
pine
at
the
top
of
a
precipice
and
look
across
the
plain
if
it
happened
to
be
winter
and
she
saw
many
teams
on
the
roads
she
hurriedly
blew
up
a
blizzard
piling
the
drifts
so
high
that
people
could
barely
get
back
to
their
homes
by
evening
if
it
chanced
to
be
summer
and
good
harvest
weather
would
sit
quietly
until
the
first
hayricks
had
been
loaded
then
down
she
would
come
with
a
couple
of
heavy
showers
which
put
an
end
to
the
work
for
that
day
it
was
only
too
true
that
she
seldom
thought
of
anything
else
than
raising
mischief
the
charcoal
burners
up
in
the
kil
mountains
hardly
dared
take
a
for
as
soon
as
she
saw
an
unwatched
kiln
she
stole
up
and
blew
on
it
until
it
began
to
burn
in
a
great
flame
if
the
metal
drivers
from
laxå
and
svartå
were
out
late
of
an
evening
would
veil
the
roads
and
the
country
round
about
in
such
dark
clouds
that
both
men
and
horses
lost
their
way
and
drove
the
heavy
trucks
down
into
swamps
and
morasses
if
on
a
summer
day
the
dean
wife
at
glanshammar
had
spread
the
tea
table
in
the
garden
and
along
would
come
a
gust
of
wind
that
lifted
the
cloth
from
the
table
and
turned
over
cups
and
saucers
they
knew
who
had
raised
the
mischief
if
the
mayor
of
örebro
hat
blew
off
so
that
he
had
to
run
across
the
whole
square
after
it
if
the
wash
on
the
line
blew
away
and
got
covered
with
dirt
or
if
the
smoke
poured
into
the
cabins
and
seemed
unable
to
find
its
way
out
through
the
chimney
it
was
easy
enough
to
guess
who
was
out
making
merry
although
was
fond
of
all
sorts
of
tantalizing
games
there
was
nothing
really
bad
about
her
one
could
see
that
she
was
hardest
on
those
who
were
quarrelsome
stingy
or
wicked
while
honest
folk
and
poor
little
children
she
would
take
under
her
wing
old
people
say
of
her
that
once
when
asker
church
was
burning
swept
through
the
air
lit
amid
fire
and
smoke
on
the
church
roof
and
averted
the
disaster
all
the
same
the
närke
folk
were
often
rather
tired
of
but
she
never
tired
of
playing
her
tricks
on
them
as
she
sat
on
the
edge
of
a
cloud
and
looked
down
upon
närke
which
rested
so
peacefully
and
comfortably
beneath
her
she
must
have
thought
the
inhabitants
would
fare
much
too
well
if
i
were
not
in
existence
they
would
grow
sleepy
and
dull
there
must
be
some
one
like
myself
to
rouse
them
and
keep
them
in
good
spirits
then
she
would
laugh
wildly
and
chattering
like
a
magpie
would
rush
off
dancing
and
spinning
from
one
end
of
the
plain
to
the
other
when
a
närke
man
saw
her
come
dragging
her
dust
trail
over
the
plain
he
could
not
help
smiling
provoking
and
tiresome
she
certainly
was
but
she
had
a
merry
spirit
it
was
just
as
refreshing
for
the
peasants
to
meet
as
it
was
for
the
plain
to
be
lashed
by
the
windstorm
nowadays
is
said
that
is
dead
and
gone
like
all
other
witches
but
this
one
can
hardly
believe
it
is
as
if
some
one
were
to
come
and
tell
you
that
henceforth
the
air
would
always
be
still
on
the
plain
and
the
wind
would
never
more
dance
across
it
with
blustering
breezes
and
drenching
showers
he
who
fancies
that
is
dead
and
gone
may
as
well
hear
what
occurred
in
närke
the
year
that
nils
holgersson
travelled
over
that
part
of
the
country
then
let
him
tell
what
he
thinks
about
it
market
eve
april
it
was
the
day
before
the
big
cattle
fair
at
örebro
it
rained
in
torrents
and
people
thought
this
is
exactly
as
in
time
at
fairs
she
used
to
be
more
prankish
than
usual
it
was
quite
in
her
line
to
arrange
a
downpour
like
this
on
a
market
eve
as
the
day
wore
on
the
rain
increased
and
toward
evening
came
regular
the
roads
were
like
bottomless
swamps
the
farmers
who
had
started
from
home
with
their
cattle
early
in
the
morning
that
they
might
arrive
at
a
seasonable
hour
fared
badly
cows
and
oxen
were
so
tired
they
could
hardly
move
and
many
of
the
poor
beasts
dropped
down
in
the
middle
of
the
road
to
show
that
they
were
too
exhausted
to
go
any
farther
all
who
lived
along
the
roadside
had
to
open
their
doors
to
the
travellers
and
harbour
them
as
best
they
could
farm
houses
barns
and
sheds
were
soon
crowded
to
their
limit
meanwhile
those
who
could
struggle
along
toward
the
inn
did
so
but
when
they
arrived
they
wished
they
had
stopped
at
some
cabin
along
the
road
all
the
cribs
in
the
barn
and
all
the
stalls
in
the
stable
were
already
occupied
there
was
no
other
choice
than
to
let
horses
and
cattle
stand
out
in
the
rain
their
masters
could
barely
manage
to
get
under
cover
the
crush
and
mud
and
slush
in
the
barn
yard
were
frightful
some
of
the
animals
were
standing
in
puddles
and
could
not
even
lie
down
there
were
thoughtful
masters
of
course
who
procured
straw
for
their
animals
to
lie
on
and
spread
blankets
over
them
but
there
were
those
also
who
sat
in
the
inn
drinking
and
gambling
entirely
forgetful
of
the
dumb
creatures
which
they
should
have
protected
the
boy
and
the
wild
geese
had
come
to
a
little
wooded
island
in
hjälmar
lake
that
evening
the
island
was
separated
from
the
main
land
by
a
narrow
and
shallow
stream
and
at
low
tide
one
could
pass
over
it
it
rained
just
as
hard
on
the
island
as
it
did
everywhere
else
the
boy
could
not
sleep
for
the
water
that
kept
dripping
down
on
him
finally
he
got
up
and
began
to
walk
he
fancied
that
he
felt
the
rain
less
when
he
moved
about
he
had
hardly
circled
the
island
when
he
heard
a
splashing
in
the
stream
presently
he
saw
a
solitary
horse
tramping
among
the
trees
never
in
all
his
life
had
he
seen
such
a
wreck
of
a
horse
he
was
and
and
so
thin
that
every
rib
could
be
seen
under
the
hide
he
bore
neither
harness
nor
saddle
only
an
old
bridle
from
which
dangled
a
obviously
he
had
had
no
difficulty
in
breaking
loose
the
horse
walked
straight
toward
the
spot
where
the
wild
geese
were
sleeping
the
boy
was
afraid
that
he
would
step
on
them
where
are
you
going
feel
your
ground
shouted
the
boy
oh
there
you
are
exclaimed
the
horse
i
walked
miles
to
meet
you
have
you
heard
of
me
asked
the
boy
astonished
i
got
ears
even
if
i
am
old
there
are
many
who
talk
of
you
nowadays
as
he
spoke
the
horse
bent
his
head
that
he
might
see
better
and
the
boy
noticed
that
he
had
a
small
head
beautiful
eyes
and
a
soft
sensitive
nose
he
must
have
been
a
good
horse
at
the
start
though
he
has
come
to
grief
in
his
old
age
he
thought
i
wish
you
would
come
with
me
and
help
me
with
something
pleaded
the
horse
the
boy
thought
it
would
be
embarrassing
to
accompany
a
creature
who
looked
so
wretched
and
excused
himself
on
account
of
the
bad
weather
you
be
no
worse
off
on
my
back
than
you
are
lying
here
said
the
horse
but
perhaps
you
do
dare
to
go
with
an
old
tramp
of
a
horse
like
me
certainly
i
dare
said
the
boy
then
wake
the
geese
so
that
we
can
arrange
with
them
where
they
shall
come
for
you
said
the
horse
the
boy
was
soon
seated
on
the
animal
back
the
old
nag
trotted
along
better
than
he
had
thought
possible
it
was
a
long
ride
in
the
rain
and
darkness
before
they
halted
near
a
large
inn
where
everything
looked
terribly
uninviting
the
wheel
tracks
were
so
deep
in
the
road
that
the
boy
feared
he
might
drown
should
he
fall
down
into
them
alongside
the
fence
which
enclosed
the
yard
some
thirty
or
forty
horses
and
cattle
were
tied
with
no
protection
against
the
rain
and
in
the
yard
were
wagons
piled
with
packing
cases
where
sheep
calves
hogs
and
chickens
were
shut
in
the
horse
walked
over
to
the
fence
and
stationed
himself
the
boy
remained
seated
upon
his
back
and
with
his
good
night
eyes
plainly
saw
how
badly
the
animals
fared
how
do
you
happen
to
be
standing
out
here
in
the
rain
he
asked
we
on
our
way
to
a
fair
at
örebro
but
we
were
obliged
to
put
up
here
on
account
of
the
rain
this
is
an
inn
but
so
many
travellers
have
already
arrived
that
there
no
room
for
us
in
the
barns
the
boy
made
no
reply
but
sat
quietly
looking
about
him
not
many
of
the
animals
were
asleep
and
on
all
sides
he
heard
complaints
and
indignant
protests
they
had
reason
enough
for
grumbling
for
the
weather
was
even
worse
than
it
had
been
earlier
in
the
day
a
freezing
wind
had
begun
to
blow
and
the
rain
which
came
beating
down
on
them
was
turning
to
snow
it
was
easy
enough
to
understand
what
the
horse
wanted
the
boy
to
help
him
with
do
you
see
that
fine
farm
yard
directly
opposite
the
inn
remarked
the
horse
yes
i
see
it
answered
the
boy
and
i
ca
comprehend
why
they
have
tried
to
find
shelter
for
all
of
you
in
there
they
are
already
full
perhaps
no
there
are
no
strangers
in
that
place
said
the
horse
the
people
who
live
on
that
farm
are
so
stingy
and
selfish
that
it
would
be
useless
for
any
one
to
ask
them
for
harbour
if
that
the
case
i
suppose
you
have
to
stand
where
you
are
i
was
born
and
raised
on
that
farm
said
the
horse
i
know
that
there
is
a
large
barn
and
a
big
cow
shed
with
many
empty
stalls
and
mangers
and
i
was
wondering
if
you
could
manage
in
some
way
or
other
to
get
us
in
over
there
i
do
think
i
could
venture
hesitated
the
boy
but
he
felt
so
sorry
for
the
poor
beasts
that
he
wanted
at
least
to
try
he
ran
into
the
strange
barn
yard
and
saw
at
once
that
all
the
outhouses
were
locked
and
the
keys
gone
he
stood
there
puzzled
and
helpless
when
aid
came
to
him
from
an
unexpected
source
a
gust
of
wind
came
sweeping
along
with
terrific
force
and
flung
open
a
shed
door
right
in
front
of
him
the
boy
was
not
long
in
getting
back
to
the
horse
it
is
possible
to
get
into
the
barn
or
the
cow
house
he
said
but
there
a
big
empty
hay
shed
that
they
have
forgotten
to
bolt
i
can
lead
you
into
that
thank
you
said
the
horse
it
will
seem
good
to
sleep
once
more
on
familiar
ground
it
the
only
happiness
i
can
expect
in
this
life
meanwhile
at
the
flourishing
farm
opposite
the
inn
the
family
sat
up
much
later
than
usual
that
evening
the
master
of
the
place
was
a
man
of
tall
and
dignified
with
a
handsome
but
melancholy
face
during
the
day
he
had
been
out
in
the
rain
and
had
got
wet
like
every
one
else
and
at
supper
he
asked
his
old
mother
who
was
still
mistress
of
the
place
to
light
a
fire
on
the
hearth
that
he
might
dry
his
clothes
the
mother
kindled
a
feeble
blaze
for
in
that
house
they
were
not
wasteful
with
wood
and
the
master
hung
his
coat
on
the
back
of
a
chair
and
placed
it
before
the
fire
with
one
foot
on
top
of
the
andiron
and
a
hand
resting
on
his
knee
he
stood
gazing
into
the
embers
thus
he
stood
for
two
whole
hours
making
no
move
other
than
to
cast
a
log
on
the
fire
now
and
then
the
mistress
removed
the
supper
things
and
turned
down
his
bed
for
the
night
before
she
went
to
her
own
room
and
seated
herself
at
intervals
she
came
to
the
door
and
looked
wonderingly
at
her
son
it
nothing
mother
i
only
thinking
he
said
his
thoughts
were
on
something
that
had
occurred
shortly
before
when
he
passed
the
inn
a
horse
dealer
had
asked
him
if
he
would
not
like
to
purchase
a
horse
and
had
shown
him
an
old
nag
so
that
he
asked
the
dealer
if
he
took
him
for
a
fool
since
he
wished
to
palm
off
such
a
beast
on
him
oh
no
said
the
horse
dealer
i
only
thought
that
inasmuch
as
the
horse
once
belonged
to
you
you
might
wish
to
give
him
a
comfortable
home
in
his
old
age
he
has
need
of
it
then
he
looked
at
the
horse
and
recognized
it
as
one
which
he
himself
had
raised
and
broken
in
but
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
purchase
such
an
old
and
useless
creature
on
that
account
no
indeed
he
was
not
one
who
squandered
his
money
all
the
same
the
sight
of
the
horse
had
awakened
many
memories
and
it
was
the
memories
that
kept
him
awake
that
horse
had
been
a
fine
animal
his
father
had
let
him
tend
it
from
the
start
he
had
broken
it
in
and
had
loved
it
above
everything
else
his
father
had
complained
that
he
used
to
feed
it
too
well
and
often
he
had
been
obliged
to
steal
out
and
smuggle
oats
to
it
once
when
he
ventured
to
talk
with
his
father
about
letting
him
buy
a
broadcloth
suit
or
having
the
cart
painted
his
father
stood
as
if
petrified
and
he
thought
the
old
man
would
have
a
stroke
he
tried
to
make
his
father
understand
that
when
he
had
a
fine
horse
to
drive
he
should
look
presentable
himself
the
father
made
no
reply
but
two
days
later
he
took
the
horse
to
örebro
and
sold
it
it
was
cruel
of
him
but
it
was
plain
that
his
father
had
feared
that
this
horse
might
lead
him
into
vanity
and
extravagance
and
now
so
long
afterward
he
had
to
admit
that
his
father
was
right
a
horse
like
that
surely
would
have
been
a
temptation
at
first
he
had
grieved
terribly
over
his
loss
many
a
time
he
had
gone
down
to
örebro
just
to
stand
on
a
street
corner
and
see
the
horse
pass
by
or
to
steal
into
the
stable
and
give
him
a
lump
of
sugar
he
thought
if
i
ever
get
the
farm
the
first
thing
i
do
will
be
to
buy
back
my
horse
now
his
father
was
gone
and
he
himself
had
been
master
for
two
years
but
he
had
not
made
a
move
toward
buying
the
horse
he
had
not
thought
of
him
for
ever
so
long
until
it
was
strange
that
he
should
have
forgotten
the
beast
so
entirely
his
father
had
been
a
very
headstrong
domineering
man
when
his
son
was
grown
and
the
two
had
worked
together
the
father
had
gained
absolute
power
over
him
the
boy
had
come
to
think
that
everything
his
father
did
was
right
and
after
he
became
the
master
he
only
tried
to
do
exactly
as
his
father
would
have
done
he
knew
of
course
that
folk
said
his
father
was
stingy
but
it
was
well
to
keep
a
tight
hold
on
one
purse
and
not
throw
away
money
needlessly
the
goods
one
has
received
should
not
be
wasted
it
was
better
to
live
on
a
place
and
be
called
stingy
than
to
carry
heavy
mortgages
like
other
farm
owners
he
had
gone
so
far
in
his
mind
when
he
was
called
back
by
a
strange
sound
it
was
as
if
a
shrill
mocking
voice
were
repeating
his
thoughts
it
better
to
keep
a
firm
hold
on
one
purse
and
be
called
stingy
than
to
be
in
debt
like
other
farm
owners
it
sounded
as
if
some
one
was
trying
to
make
sport
of
his
wisdom
and
he
was
about
to
lose
his
temper
when
he
realized
that
it
was
all
a
mistake
the
wind
was
beginning
to
rage
and
he
had
been
standing
there
getting
so
sleepy
that
he
mistook
the
howling
of
the
wind
in
the
chimney
for
human
speech
he
glanced
up
at
the
wall
clock
which
just
then
struck
eleven
it
time
that
you
were
in
bed
he
remarked
to
himself
then
he
remembered
that
he
had
not
yet
gone
the
rounds
of
the
farm
yard
as
it
was
his
custom
to
do
every
night
to
make
sure
that
all
doors
were
closed
and
all
lights
extinguished
this
was
something
he
had
never
neglected
since
he
became
master
he
drew
on
his
coat
and
went
out
in
the
storm
he
found
everything
as
it
should
be
save
that
the
door
to
the
empty
hay
shed
had
been
blown
open
by
the
wind
he
stepped
inside
for
the
key
locked
the
shed
door
and
put
the
key
into
his
coat
pocket
then
he
went
back
to
the
house
removed
his
coat
and
hung
it
before
the
fire
even
now
he
did
not
retire
but
began
pacing
the
floor
the
storm
without
with
its
biting
wind
and
rain
was
terrible
and
his
old
horse
was
standing
in
this
storm
without
so
much
as
a
blanket
to
protect
him
he
should
at
least
have
given
his
old
friend
a
roof
over
his
head
since
he
had
come
such
a
long
distance
at
the
inn
across
the
way
the
boy
heard
an
old
wall
clock
strike
eleven
times
just
then
he
was
untying
the
animals
to
lead
them
to
the
shed
in
the
farm
yard
opposite
it
took
some
time
to
rouse
them
and
get
them
into
line
when
all
were
ready
they
marched
in
a
long
procession
into
the
stingy
farmer
yard
with
the
boy
as
their
guide
while
the
boy
had
been
assembling
them
the
farmer
had
gone
the
rounds
of
the
farm
yard
and
locked
the
hay
shed
so
that
when
the
animals
came
along
the
door
was
closed
the
boy
stood
there
dismayed
he
could
not
let
the
creatures
stand
out
there
he
must
go
into
the
house
and
find
the
key
keep
them
quiet
out
here
while
i
go
in
and
fetch
the
key
he
said
to
the
old
horse
and
off
he
ran
on
the
path
right
in
front
of
the
house
he
paused
to
think
out
how
he
should
get
inside
as
he
stood
there
he
noticed
two
little
wanderers
coming
down
the
road
who
stopped
before
the
inn
the
boy
saw
at
once
that
they
were
two
little
girls
and
ran
toward
them
come
now
britta
maja
said
one
you
must
cry
any
more
now
we
are
at
the
inn
here
they
will
surely
take
us
in
the
girl
had
but
just
said
this
when
the
boy
called
to
her
no
you
must
try
to
get
in
there
it
is
simply
impossible
but
at
the
farm
house
opposite
there
are
no
guests
go
there
instead
the
little
girls
heard
the
words
distinctly
though
they
could
not
see
the
one
who
spoke
to
them
they
did
not
wonder
much
at
that
however
for
the
night
was
as
black
as
pitch
the
larger
of
the
girls
promptly
answered
we
do
care
to
enter
that
place
because
those
who
live
there
are
stingy
and
cruel
it
is
their
fault
that
we
two
must
go
out
on
the
highways
and
beg
that
may
be
so
said
the
boy
but
all
the
same
you
should
go
there
you
shall
see
that
it
will
be
well
for
you
we
can
try
but
it
is
doubtful
that
they
will
even
let
us
enter
observed
the
two
little
girls
as
they
walked
up
to
the
house
and
knocked
the
master
was
standing
by
the
fire
thinking
of
the
horse
when
he
heard
the
knocking
he
stepped
to
the
door
to
see
what
was
up
thinking
all
the
while
that
he
would
not
let
himself
be
tempted
into
admitting
any
wayfarer
as
he
fumbled
the
lock
a
gust
of
wind
came
along
wrenched
the
door
from
his
hand
and
swung
it
open
to
close
it
he
had
to
step
out
on
the
porch
and
when
he
stepped
back
into
the
house
the
two
little
girls
were
standing
within
they
were
two
poor
beggar
girls
ragged
dirty
and
starving
two
little
tots
bent
under
the
burden
of
their
beggar
packs
which
were
as
large
as
themselves
who
are
you
that
go
prowling
about
at
this
hour
of
the
night
said
the
master
gruffly
the
two
children
did
not
answer
immediately
but
first
removed
their
packs
then
they
walked
up
to
the
man
and
stretched
forth
their
tiny
hands
in
greeting
we
are
anna
and
britta
maja
from
the
engärd
said
the
elder
and
we
were
going
to
ask
for
a
night
lodging
he
did
not
take
the
outstretched
hands
and
was
just
about
to
drive
out
the
beggar
children
when
a
fresh
recollection
faced
him
engärd
was
not
that
a
little
cabin
where
a
poor
widow
with
five
children
had
lived
the
widow
had
owed
his
father
a
few
hundred
kroner
and
in
order
to
get
back
his
money
he
had
sold
her
cabin
after
that
the
widow
with
her
three
eldest
children
went
to
norrland
to
seek
employment
and
the
two
youngest
became
a
charge
on
the
parish
as
he
called
this
to
mind
he
grew
bitter
he
knew
that
his
father
had
been
severely
censured
for
squeezing
out
that
money
which
by
right
belonged
to
him
what
are
you
doing
nowadays
he
asked
in
a
cross
tone
did
the
board
of
charities
take
charge
of
you
why
do
you
roam
around
and
beg
it
not
our
fault
replied
the
larger
girl
the
people
with
whom
we
are
living
have
sent
us
out
to
beg
well
your
packs
are
filled
the
farmer
observed
so
you
complain
now
you
better
take
out
some
of
the
food
you
have
with
you
and
eat
your
fill
for
here
you
get
no
food
as
all
the
women
folk
are
in
bed
later
you
may
lie
down
in
the
corner
by
the
hearth
so
you
wo
have
to
freeze
he
waved
his
hand
as
if
to
ward
them
off
and
his
eyes
took
on
a
hard
look
he
was
thankful
that
he
had
had
a
father
who
had
been
careful
of
his
property
otherwise
he
might
perhaps
have
been
forced
in
childhood
to
run
about
and
beg
as
these
children
now
did
no
sooner
had
he
thought
this
out
to
the
end
than
the
shrill
mocking
voice
he
had
heard
once
before
that
evening
repeated
it
word
for
word
he
listened
and
at
once
understood
that
it
was
nothing
only
the
wind
roaring
in
the
chimney
but
the
queer
thing
about
it
was
when
the
wind
repeated
his
thoughts
they
seemed
so
strangely
stupid
and
hard
and
false
the
children
meanwhile
had
stretched
themselves
side
by
side
on
the
floor
they
were
not
quiet
but
lay
there
muttering
do
be
still
wo
you
he
growled
for
he
was
in
such
an
irritable
mood
that
he
could
have
beaten
them
but
the
mumbling
continued
and
again
he
called
for
silence
when
mother
went
away
piped
a
clear
little
voice
she
made
me
promise
that
every
night
i
would
say
my
evening
prayer
i
must
do
this
and
britta
maja
too
as
soon
as
we
have
said
who
cares
for
little
children
we
be
quiet
the
master
sat
quite
still
while
the
little
ones
said
their
prayers
then
he
rose
and
began
pacing
back
and
forth
back
and
forth
wringing
his
hands
all
the
while
as
though
he
had
met
with
some
great
sorrow
the
horse
driven
out
and
wrecked
these
two
children
turned
into
road
beggars
both
father
doings
perhaps
father
did
not
do
right
after
all
he
thought
he
sat
down
again
and
buried
his
head
in
his
hands
suddenly
his
lips
began
to
quiver
and
into
his
eyes
came
tears
which
he
hastily
wiped
away
fresh
tears
came
and
he
was
just
as
prompt
to
brush
these
away
but
it
was
useless
for
more
followed
when
his
mother
stepped
into
the
room
he
swung
his
chair
quickly
and
turned
his
back
to
her
she
must
have
noticed
something
unusual
for
she
stood
quietly
behind
him
a
long
while
as
if
waiting
for
him
to
speak
she
realized
how
difficult
it
always
is
for
men
to
talk
of
the
things
they
feel
most
deeply
she
must
help
him
of
course
from
her
bedroom
she
had
observed
all
that
had
taken
place
in
the
living
room
so
that
she
did
not
have
to
ask
questions
she
walked
very
softly
over
to
the
two
sleeping
children
lifted
them
and
bore
them
to
her
own
bed
then
she
went
back
to
her
son
lars
she
said
as
if
she
did
not
see
that
he
was
weeping
you
had
better
let
me
keep
these
children
what
mother
he
gasped
trying
to
smother
the
sobs
i
have
been
suffering
for
years
ever
since
father
took
the
cabin
from
their
mother
and
so
have
you
yes
but
i
want
to
keep
them
here
and
make
something
of
them
they
are
too
good
to
beg
he
could
not
speak
for
now
the
tears
were
beyond
his
control
but
he
took
his
old
mother
withered
hand
and
patted
it
then
he
jumped
up
as
if
something
had
frightened
him
what
would
father
have
said
of
this
father
had
his
day
at
ruling
retorted
the
mother
now
it
is
your
day
as
long
as
father
lived
we
had
to
obey
him
now
is
the
time
to
show
what
you
are
her
son
was
so
astonished
that
he
ceased
crying
but
i
have
just
shown
what
i
am
he
returned
no
you
have
protested
the
mother
you
only
try
to
be
like
him
father
experienced
hard
times
which
made
him
fear
poverty
he
believed
that
he
had
to
think
of
himself
first
but
you
have
never
had
any
difficulties
that
should
make
you
hard
you
have
more
than
you
need
and
it
would
be
unnatural
of
you
not
to
think
of
others
when
the
two
little
girls
entered
the
house
the
boy
slipped
in
behind
them
and
secreted
himself
in
a
dark
corner
he
had
not
been
there
long
before
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
shed
key
which
the
farmer
had
thrust
into
his
coat
pocket
when
the
master
of
the
house
drives
the
children
out
i
take
the
key
and
ran
he
thought
but
the
children
were
not
driven
out
and
the
boy
crouched
in
the
corner
not
knowing
what
he
should
do
next
the
mother
talked
long
with
her
son
and
while
she
was
speaking
he
stopped
weeping
gradually
his
features
softened
he
looked
like
another
person
all
the
while
he
was
stroking
the
wasted
old
hand
now
we
may
as
well
retire
said
the
old
lady
when
she
saw
that
he
was
calm
again
no
he
said
suddenly
rising
i
can
not
retire
yet
there
a
stranger
without
whom
i
must
shelter
he
said
nothing
further
but
quickly
drew
on
his
coat
lit
the
lantern
and
went
out
there
were
the
same
wind
and
chill
without
but
as
he
stepped
to
the
porch
he
began
to
sing
softly
he
wondered
if
the
horse
would
know
him
and
if
he
would
be
glad
to
come
back
to
his
old
stable
as
he
crossed
the
house
yard
he
heard
a
door
slam
that
shed
door
has
blown
open
again
he
thought
and
went
over
to
close
it
a
moment
later
he
stood
by
the
shed
and
was
just
going
to
shut
the
door
when
he
heard
a
rustling
within
the
boy
who
had
watched
his
opportunity
had
run
directly
to
the
shed
where
he
left
the
animals
but
they
were
no
longer
out
in
the
rain
a
strong
wind
had
long
since
thrown
open
the
door
and
helped
them
to
get
a
roof
over
their
heads
the
patter
which
the
master
heard
was
occasioned
by
the
boy
running
into
the
shed
by
the
light
of
the
lantern
the
man
could
see
into
the
shed
the
whole
floor
was
covered
with
sleeping
cattle
there
was
no
human
being
to
be
seen
the
animals
were
not
bound
but
were
lying
here
and
there
in
the
straw
he
was
enraged
at
the
intrusion
and
began
storming
and
shrieking
to
rouse
the
sleepers
and
drive
them
out
but
the
creatures
lay
still
and
would
not
let
themselves
be
disturbed
the
only
one
that
rose
was
an
old
horse
that
came
slowly
toward
him
all
of
a
sudden
the
man
became
silent
he
recognized
the
beast
by
its
gait
he
raised
the
lantern
and
the
horse
came
over
and
laid
its
head
on
his
shoulder
the
master
patted
and
stroked
it
my
old
horsy
my
old
horsy
he
said
what
have
they
done
to
you
yes
dear
i
buy
you
back
you
never
again
have
to
leave
this
place
you
shall
do
whatever
you
like
horsy
mine
those
whom
you
have
brought
with
you
may
remain
here
but
you
shall
come
with
me
to
the
stable
now
i
can
give
you
all
the
oats
you
are
able
to
eat
without
having
to
smuggle
them
and
you
not
all
used
up
either
the
handsomest
horse
on
the
church
knoll
that
what
you
shall
be
once
more
there
there
there
there
the
breaking
up
of
the
ice
april
the
following
day
the
weather
was
clear
and
beautiful
there
was
a
strong
west
wind
people
were
glad
of
that
for
it
dried
up
the
roads
which
had
been
soaked
by
the
heavy
rains
of
the
day
before
early
in
the
morning
the
two
småland
children
osa
the
goose
girl
and
little
mats
were
out
on
the
highway
leading
from
sörmland
to
närke
the
road
ran
alongside
the
southern
shore
of
hjälmar
lake
and
the
children
were
walking
along
looking
at
the
ice
which
covered
the
greater
part
of
it
the
morning
sun
darted
its
clear
rays
upon
the
ice
which
did
not
look
dark
and
forbidding
like
most
spring
ice
but
sparkled
temptingly
as
far
as
they
could
see
the
ice
was
firm
and
dry
the
rain
had
run
down
into
cracks
and
hollows
or
been
absorbed
by
the
ice
itself
the
children
saw
only
the
sound
ice
osa
the
goose
girl
and
little
mats
were
on
their
way
north
and
they
could
not
help
thinking
of
all
the
steps
they
would
be
saved
if
they
could
cut
straight
across
the
lake
instead
of
going
around
it
they
knew
to
be
sure
that
spring
ice
is
treacherous
but
this
looked
perfectly
secure
they
could
see
that
it
was
several
inches
thick
near
the
shore
they
saw
a
path
which
they
might
follow
and
the
opposite
shore
appeared
to
be
so
near
that
they
ought
to
be
able
to
get
there
in
an
hour
come
let
try
said
little
mats
if
we
only
look
before
us
so
that
we
do
go
down
into
some
hole
we
can
do
it
so
they
went
out
on
the
lake
the
ice
was
not
very
slippery
but
rather
easy
to
walk
upon
there
was
more
water
on
it
than
they
expected
to
see
and
here
and
there
were
cracks
where
the
water
purled
up
one
had
to
watch
out
for
such
places
but
that
was
easy
to
do
in
broad
daylight
with
the
sun
shining
the
children
advanced
rapidly
and
talked
only
of
how
sensible
they
were
to
have
gone
out
on
the
ice
instead
of
tramping
the
slushy
road
when
they
had
been
walking
a
while
they
came
to
vin
island
where
an
old
woman
had
sighted
them
from
her
window
she
rushed
from
her
cabin
waved
them
back
and
shouted
something
which
they
could
not
hear
they
understood
perfectly
well
that
she
was
warning
them
not
to
come
any
farther
but
they
thought
there
was
no
immediate
danger
it
would
be
stupid
for
them
to
leave
the
ice
when
all
was
going
so
well
therefore
they
went
on
past
vin
island
and
had
a
stretch
of
seven
miles
of
ice
ahead
of
them
out
there
was
so
much
water
that
the
children
were
obliged
to
take
roundabout
ways
but
that
was
sport
to
them
they
vied
with
each
other
as
to
which
could
find
the
soundest
ice
they
were
neither
tired
nor
hungry
the
whole
day
was
before
them
and
they
laughed
at
each
obstacle
they
met
now
and
then
they
cast
a
glance
ahead
at
the
farther
shore
it
still
appeared
far
away
although
they
had
been
walking
a
good
hour
they
were
rather
surprised
that
the
lake
was
so
broad
the
shore
seems
to
be
moving
farther
away
from
us
little
mats
observed
out
there
the
children
were
not
protected
against
the
wind
which
was
becoming
stronger
and
stronger
every
minute
and
was
pressing
their
clothing
so
close
to
their
bodies
that
they
could
hardly
go
on
the
cold
wind
was
the
first
disagreeable
thing
they
had
met
with
on
the
journey
but
the
amazing
part
of
it
was
that
the
wind
came
sweeping
along
with
a
loud
roar
as
if
it
brought
with
it
the
noise
of
a
large
mill
or
factory
though
nothing
of
the
kind
was
to
be
found
out
there
on
the
ice
they
had
walked
to
the
west
of
the
big
island
valen
now
they
thought
they
were
nearing
the
north
shore
suddenly
the
wind
began
to
blow
more
and
more
while
the
loud
roaring
increased
so
rapidly
that
they
began
to
feel
uneasy
all
at
once
it
occurred
to
them
that
the
roar
was
caused
by
the
foaming
and
rushing
of
the
waves
breaking
against
a
shore
even
this
seemed
improbable
since
the
lake
was
still
covered
with
ice
at
all
events
they
paused
and
looked
about
they
noticed
far
in
the
west
a
white
bank
which
stretched
clear
across
the
lake
at
first
they
thought
it
was
a
snowbank
alongside
a
road
later
they
realized
it
was
the
waves
dashing
against
the
ice
they
took
hold
of
hands
and
ran
without
saying
a
word
open
sea
lay
beyond
in
the
west
and
suddenly
the
streak
of
foam
appeared
to
be
moving
eastward
they
wondered
if
the
ice
was
going
to
break
all
over
what
was
going
to
happen
they
felt
now
that
they
were
in
great
danger
all
at
once
it
seemed
as
if
the
ice
under
their
feet
rose
rose
and
sank
as
if
some
one
from
below
were
pushing
it
presently
they
heard
a
hollow
boom
and
then
there
were
cracks
in
the
ice
all
around
them
the
children
could
see
how
they
crept
along
under
the
the
next
moment
all
was
still
then
the
rising
and
sinking
began
again
thereupon
the
cracks
began
to
widen
into
crevices
through
which
the
water
bubbled
up
by
and
by
the
crevices
became
gaps
soon
after
that
the
ice
was
divided
into
large
floes
osa
said
little
mats
this
must
be
the
breaking
up
of
the
ice
why
so
it
is
little
mats
said
osa
but
as
yet
we
can
get
to
land
run
for
your
life
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
wind
and
waves
had
a
good
deal
of
work
to
do
yet
to
clear
the
ice
from
the
lake
the
hardest
part
was
done
when
the
burst
into
pieces
but
all
these
pieces
must
be
broken
and
hurled
against
each
other
to
be
crushed
worn
down
and
dissolved
there
was
still
a
great
deal
of
hard
and
sound
ice
left
which
formed
large
unbroken
surfaces
the
greatest
danger
for
the
children
lay
in
the
fact
that
they
had
no
general
view
of
the
ice
they
did
not
see
the
places
where
the
gaps
were
so
wide
that
they
could
not
possibly
jump
over
them
nor
did
they
know
where
to
find
any
floes
that
would
hold
them
so
they
wandered
aimlessly
back
and
forth
going
farther
out
on
the
lake
instead
of
nearer
land
at
last
confused
and
terrified
they
stood
still
and
wept
then
a
flock
of
wild
geese
in
rapid
flight
came
rushing
by
they
shrieked
loudly
and
sharply
but
the
strange
thing
was
that
above
the
the
little
children
heard
these
words
you
must
go
to
the
right
the
right
the
right
they
began
at
once
to
follow
the
advice
but
before
long
they
were
again
standing
irresolute
facing
another
broad
gap
again
they
heard
the
geese
shrieking
above
them
and
again
amid
the
they
distinguished
a
few
words
stand
where
you
are
stand
where
you
are
the
children
did
not
say
a
word
to
each
other
but
obeyed
and
stood
still
soon
after
that
the
floated
together
so
that
they
could
cross
the
gap
then
they
took
hold
of
hands
again
and
ran
they
were
afraid
not
only
of
the
peril
but
of
the
mysterious
help
that
had
come
to
them
soon
they
had
to
stop
again
and
immediately
the
sound
of
the
voice
reached
them
straight
ahead
straight
ahead
it
said
this
leading
continued
for
about
half
an
hour
by
that
time
they
had
reached
ljunger
point
where
they
left
the
ice
and
waded
to
shore
they
were
still
terribly
frightened
even
though
they
were
on
firm
land
they
did
not
stop
to
look
back
at
the
lake
where
the
waves
were
pitching
the
faster
and
faster
but
ran
on
when
they
had
gone
a
short
distance
along
the
point
osa
paused
suddenly
wait
here
little
mats
she
said
i
have
forgotten
something
osa
the
goose
girl
went
down
to
the
strand
again
where
she
stopped
to
rummage
in
her
bag
finally
she
fished
out
a
little
wooden
shoe
which
she
placed
on
a
stone
where
it
could
be
plainly
seen
then
she
ran
to
little
mats
without
once
looking
back
but
the
instant
her
back
was
turned
a
big
white
goose
shot
down
from
the
sky
like
a
streak
of
lightning
snatched
the
wooden
shoe
and
flew
away
with
it
thumbietot
and
the
bears
the
ironworks
april
when
the
wild
geese
and
thumbietot
had
helped
osa
the
goose
girl
and
little
mats
across
the
ice
they
flew
into
westmanland
where
they
alighted
in
a
grain
field
to
feed
and
rest
a
strong
west
wind
blew
almost
the
entire
day
on
which
the
wild
geese
travelled
over
the
mining
districts
and
as
soon
as
they
attempted
to
direct
their
course
northward
they
were
buffeted
toward
the
east
now
akka
thought
that
smirre
fox
was
at
large
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
province
therefore
she
would
not
fly
in
that
direction
but
turned
back
time
and
again
struggling
westward
with
great
difficulty
at
this
rate
the
wild
geese
advanced
very
slowly
and
late
in
the
afternoon
they
were
still
in
the
westmanland
mining
districts
toward
evening
the
wind
abated
suddenly
and
the
tired
travellers
hoped
that
they
would
have
an
interval
of
easy
flight
before
sundown
then
along
came
a
violent
gust
of
wind
which
tossed
the
geese
before
it
like
balls
and
the
boy
who
was
sitting
comfortably
with
no
thought
of
peril
was
lifted
from
the
goose
back
and
hurled
into
space
little
and
light
as
he
was
he
could
not
fall
straight
to
the
ground
in
such
a
wind
so
at
first
he
was
carried
along
with
it
drifting
down
slowly
and
spasmodically
as
a
leaf
falls
from
a
tree
why
this
is
so
bad
thought
the
boy
as
he
fell
i
tumbling
as
easily
as
if
i
were
only
a
scrap
of
paper
morten
will
doubtless
hurry
along
and
pick
me
up
the
first
thing
the
boy
did
when
he
landed
was
to
tear
off
his
cap
and
wave
it
so
that
the
big
white
gander
should
see
where
he
was
here
am
i
where
are
you
here
am
i
where
are
you
he
called
and
was
rather
surprised
that
morten
was
not
already
at
his
side
but
the
big
white
gander
was
not
to
be
seen
nor
was
the
wild
goose
flock
outlined
against
the
sky
it
had
entirely
disappeared
he
thought
this
rather
singular
but
he
was
neither
worried
nor
frightened
not
for
a
second
did
it
occur
to
him
that
folk
like
akka
and
morten
would
abandon
him
the
unexpected
gust
of
wind
had
probably
borne
them
along
with
it
as
soon
as
they
could
manage
to
turn
they
would
surely
come
back
and
fetch
him
but
what
was
this
where
on
earth
was
he
anyway
he
had
been
standing
gazing
toward
the
sky
for
some
sign
of
the
geese
but
now
he
happened
to
glance
about
him
he
had
not
come
down
on
even
ground
but
had
dropped
into
a
deep
wide
mountain
cave
or
whatever
it
might
be
it
was
as
large
as
a
church
with
almost
perpendicular
walls
on
all
four
sides
and
with
no
roof
at
all
on
the
ground
were
some
huge
rocks
between
which
moss
and
and
dwarfed
birches
grew
here
and
there
in
the
wall
were
projections
from
which
swung
rickety
ladders
at
one
side
there
was
a
dark
passage
which
apparently
led
far
into
the
mountain
the
boy
had
not
been
travelling
over
the
mining
districts
a
whole
day
for
nothing
he
comprehended
at
once
that
the
big
cleft
had
been
made
by
the
men
who
had
mined
ore
in
this
place
i
must
try
and
climb
back
to
earth
again
he
thought
otherwise
i
fear
that
my
companions
wo
find
me
he
was
about
to
go
over
to
the
wall
when
some
one
seized
him
from
behind
and
he
heard
a
gruff
voice
growl
in
his
ear
who
are
you
the
boy
turned
quickly
and
in
the
confusion
of
the
moment
he
thought
he
was
facing
a
huge
rock
covered
with
brownish
moss
then
he
noticed
that
the
rock
had
broad
paws
to
walk
with
a
head
two
eyes
and
a
growling
mouth
he
could
not
pull
himself
together
to
answer
nor
did
the
big
beast
appear
to
expect
it
of
him
for
it
knocked
him
down
rolled
him
back
and
forth
with
its
paws
and
nosed
him
it
seemed
just
about
ready
to
swallow
him
when
it
changed
its
mind
and
called
brumme
and
mulle
come
here
you
cubs
and
you
shall
have
something
good
to
eat
a
pair
of
frowzy
cubs
as
uncertain
on
their
feet
and
as
woolly
as
puppies
came
tumbling
along
what
have
you
got
mamma
bear
may
we
see
oh
may
we
see
shrieked
the
cubs
excitedly
oho
so
i
fallen
in
with
bears
thought
the
boy
to
himself
now
smirre
fox
wo
have
to
trouble
himself
further
to
chase
after
me
the
mother
bear
pushed
the
boy
along
to
the
cubs
one
of
them
nabbed
him
quickly
and
ran
off
with
him
but
he
did
not
bite
hard
he
was
playful
and
wanted
to
amuse
himself
awhile
with
thumbietot
before
eating
him
the
other
cub
was
after
the
first
one
to
snatch
the
boy
for
himself
and
as
he
lumbered
along
he
managed
to
tumble
straight
down
on
the
head
of
the
one
that
carried
the
boy
so
the
two
cubs
rolled
over
each
other
biting
clawing
and
snarling
during
the
tussle
the
boy
got
loose
ran
over
to
the
wall
and
started
to
scale
it
then
both
cubs
scurried
after
him
and
nimbly
scaling
the
cliff
they
caught
up
with
him
and
tossed
him
down
on
the
moss
like
a
ball
now
i
know
how
a
poor
little
mousie
fares
when
it
falls
into
the
claws
thought
the
boy
he
made
several
attempts
to
get
away
he
ran
deep
down
into
the
old
tunnel
and
hid
behind
the
rocks
and
climbed
the
birches
but
the
cubs
hunted
him
out
go
where
he
would
the
instant
they
caught
him
they
let
him
go
so
that
he
could
run
away
again
and
they
should
have
the
fun
of
recapturing
him
at
last
the
boy
got
so
sick
and
tired
of
it
all
that
he
threw
himself
down
on
the
ground
run
away
growled
the
cubs
or
we
eat
you
up
you
have
to
eat
me
then
said
the
boy
for
i
ca
run
any
more
immediately
both
cubs
rushed
over
to
the
mother
bear
and
complained
mamma
bear
oh
mamma
bear
he
wo
play
any
more
then
you
must
divide
him
evenly
between
you
said
mother
bear
when
the
boy
heard
this
he
was
so
scared
that
he
jumped
up
instantly
and
began
playing
again
as
it
was
bedtime
mother
bear
called
to
the
cubs
that
they
must
come
now
and
cuddle
up
to
her
and
go
to
sleep
they
had
been
having
such
a
good
time
that
they
wished
to
continue
their
play
next
day
so
they
took
the
boy
between
them
and
laid
their
paws
over
him
they
did
not
want
him
to
move
without
waking
them
they
went
to
sleep
immediately
the
boy
thought
that
after
a
while
he
would
try
to
steal
away
but
never
in
all
his
life
had
he
been
so
tumbled
and
tossed
and
hunted
and
rolled
and
he
was
so
tired
out
that
he
too
fell
asleep
by
and
by
father
bear
came
clambering
down
the
mountain
wall
the
boy
was
wakened
by
his
tearing
away
stone
and
gravel
as
he
swung
himself
into
the
old
mine
the
boy
was
afraid
to
move
much
but
he
managed
to
stretch
himself
and
turn
over
so
that
he
could
see
the
big
bear
he
was
a
frightfully
coarse
huge
old
beast
with
great
paws
large
glistening
tusks
and
wicked
little
eyes
the
boy
could
not
help
shuddering
as
he
looked
at
this
old
monarch
of
the
forest
it
smells
like
a
human
being
around
here
said
father
bear
the
instant
he
came
up
to
mother
bear
and
his
growl
was
as
the
rolling
of
thunder
how
can
you
imagine
anything
so
absurd
said
mother
bear
without
disturbing
herself
it
has
been
settled
for
good
and
all
that
we
are
not
to
harm
mankind
any
more
but
if
one
of
them
were
to
put
in
an
appearance
here
where
the
cubs
and
i
have
our
quarters
there
be
enough
left
of
him
for
you
to
catch
even
a
scent
of
him
father
bear
lay
down
beside
mother
bear
you
ought
to
know
me
well
enough
to
understand
that
i
do
allow
anything
dangerous
to
come
near
the
cubs
talk
instead
of
what
you
have
been
doing
i
have
seen
you
for
a
whole
week
i
been
looking
about
for
a
new
residence
said
father
bear
first
i
went
over
to
vermland
to
learn
from
our
kinsmen
at
ekshärad
how
they
fared
in
that
country
but
i
had
my
trouble
for
nothing
there
was
a
bear
den
left
in
the
whole
forest
i
believe
the
humans
want
the
whole
earth
to
themselves
said
mother
bear
even
if
we
leave
people
and
cattle
in
peace
and
live
solely
upon
lignon
and
insects
and
green
things
we
can
not
remain
unmolested
in
the
forest
i
wonder
where
we
could
move
to
in
order
to
live
in
peace
we
lived
comfortably
for
many
years
in
this
pit
observed
father
bear
but
i
ca
be
content
here
now
since
the
big
has
been
built
right
in
our
neighbourhood
lately
i
have
been
taking
a
look
at
the
land
east
of
dal
river
over
by
garpen
mountain
old
mine
pits
are
plentiful
there
too
and
other
fine
retreats
i
thought
it
looked
as
if
one
might
be
fairly
protected
against
men
the
instant
father
bear
said
this
he
sat
up
and
began
to
sniff
it
extraordinary
that
whenever
i
speak
of
human
beings
i
catch
that
queer
scent
again
he
remarked
go
and
see
for
yourself
if
you
do
believe
me
challenged
mother
bear
i
should
just
like
to
know
where
a
human
being
could
manage
to
hide
down
here
the
bear
walked
all
around
the
cave
and
nosed
finally
he
went
back
and
lay
down
without
a
word
what
did
i
tell
you
said
mother
bear
but
of
course
you
think
that
no
one
but
yourself
has
any
nose
or
ears
one
ca
be
too
careful
with
such
neighbours
as
we
have
said
father
bear
gently
then
he
leaped
up
with
a
roar
as
luck
would
have
it
one
of
the
cubs
had
moved
a
paw
over
to
nils
holgersson
face
and
the
poor
little
wretch
could
not
breathe
but
began
to
sneeze
it
was
impossible
for
mother
bear
to
keep
father
bear
back
any
longer
he
pushed
the
young
ones
to
right
and
left
and
caught
sight
of
the
boy
before
he
had
time
to
sit
up
he
would
have
swallowed
him
instantly
if
mother
bear
had
not
cast
herself
between
them
do
touch
him
he
belongs
to
the
cubs
she
said
they
have
had
such
fun
with
him
the
whole
evening
that
they
could
bear
to
eat
him
up
but
wanted
to
save
him
until
morning
father
bear
pushed
mother
bear
aside
do
meddle
with
what
you
do
understand
he
roared
ca
you
scent
that
human
odour
about
him
from
afar
i
shall
eat
him
at
once
or
he
will
play
us
some
mean
trick
he
opened
his
jaws
again
but
meanwhile
the
boy
had
had
time
to
think
and
quick
as
a
flash
he
dug
into
his
knapsack
and
brought
forth
some
matches
his
sole
weapon
of
defence
struck
one
on
his
leather
breeches
and
stuck
the
burning
match
into
the
bear
open
mouth
father
bear
snorted
when
he
smelled
the
sulphur
and
with
that
the
flame
went
out
the
boy
was
ready
with
another
match
but
curiously
enough
father
bear
did
not
repeat
his
attack
can
you
light
many
of
those
little
blue
roses
asked
father
bear
i
can
light
enough
to
put
an
end
to
the
whole
forest
replied
the
boy
for
he
thought
that
in
this
way
he
might
be
able
to
scare
father
bear
oh
that
would
be
no
trick
for
me
boasted
the
boy
hoping
that
this
would
make
the
bear
respect
him
good
exclaimed
the
bear
you
shall
render
me
a
service
now
i
very
glad
that
i
did
not
eat
you
father
bear
carefully
took
the
boy
between
his
tusks
and
climbed
up
from
the
pit
he
did
this
with
remarkable
ease
and
agility
considering
that
he
was
so
big
and
heavy
as
soon
as
he
was
up
he
speedily
made
for
the
woods
it
was
evident
that
father
bear
was
created
to
squeeze
through
dense
forests
the
heavy
body
pushed
through
the
brushwood
as
a
boat
does
through
the
water
father
bear
ran
along
till
he
came
to
a
hill
at
the
skirt
of
the
forest
where
he
could
see
the
big
here
he
lay
down
and
placed
the
boy
in
front
of
him
holding
him
securely
between
his
forepaws
now
look
down
at
that
big
he
commanded
the
great
ironworks
with
many
tall
buildings
stood
at
the
edge
of
a
waterfall
high
chimneys
sent
forth
dark
clouds
of
smoke
blasting
furnaces
were
in
full
blaze
and
light
shone
from
all
the
windows
and
apertures
within
hammers
and
rolling
mills
were
going
with
such
force
that
the
air
rang
with
their
clatter
and
boom
all
around
the
workshops
proper
were
immense
coal
sheds
great
slag
heaps
warehouses
wood
piles
and
tool
sheds
just
beyond
were
long
rows
of
workingmen
homes
pretty
villas
schoolhouses
assembly
halls
and
shops
but
there
all
was
quiet
and
apparently
everybody
was
asleep
the
boy
did
not
glance
in
that
direction
but
gazed
intently
at
the
ironworks
the
earth
around
them
was
black
the
sky
above
them
was
like
a
great
fiery
dome
the
rapids
white
with
foam
rushed
by
while
the
buildings
themselves
were
sending
out
light
and
smoke
fire
and
sparks
it
was
the
grandest
sight
the
boy
had
ever
seen
surely
you
do
mean
to
say
you
can
set
fire
to
a
place
like
that
remarked
the
bear
doubtingly
the
boy
stood
wedged
between
the
beast
paws
thinking
the
only
thing
that
might
save
him
would
be
that
the
bear
should
have
a
high
opinion
of
his
capability
and
power
it
all
the
same
to
me
he
answered
with
a
superior
air
big
or
little
i
can
burn
it
down
then
i
tell
you
something
said
father
bear
my
forefathers
lived
in
this
region
from
the
time
that
the
forests
first
sprang
up
from
them
i
inherited
hunting
grounds
and
pastures
lairs
and
retreats
and
have
lived
here
in
peace
all
my
life
in
the
beginning
i
was
troubled
much
by
the
human
kind
they
dug
in
the
mountains
and
picked
up
a
little
ore
down
here
by
the
rapids
they
had
a
forge
and
a
furnace
but
the
hammers
sounded
only
a
few
hours
during
the
day
and
the
furnace
was
not
fired
more
than
two
moons
at
a
stretch
it
was
so
bad
but
that
i
could
stand
it
but
these
last
years
since
they
have
built
this
which
keeps
up
the
same
racket
both
day
and
night
life
here
has
become
intolerable
formerly
only
a
manager
and
a
couple
of
blacksmiths
lived
here
but
now
there
are
so
many
people
that
i
can
never
feel
safe
from
them
i
thought
that
i
should
have
to
move
away
but
i
have
discovered
something
better
the
boy
wondered
what
father
bear
had
hit
upon
but
no
opportunity
was
afforded
him
to
ask
as
the
bear
took
him
between
his
tusks
again
and
lumbered
down
the
hill
the
boy
could
see
nothing
but
knew
by
the
increasing
noise
that
they
were
approaching
the
rolling
mills
father
bear
was
well
informed
regarding
the
ironworks
he
had
prowled
around
there
on
many
a
dark
night
had
observed
what
went
on
within
and
had
wondered
if
there
would
never
be
any
cessation
of
the
work
he
had
tested
the
walls
with
his
paws
and
wished
that
he
were
only
strong
enough
to
knock
down
the
whole
structure
with
a
single
blow
he
was
not
easily
distinguishable
against
the
dark
ground
and
when
in
addition
he
remained
in
the
shadow
of
the
walls
there
was
not
much
danger
of
his
being
discovered
now
he
walked
fearlessly
between
the
workshops
and
climbed
to
the
top
of
a
slag
heap
there
he
sat
up
on
his
haunches
took
the
boy
between
his
forepaws
and
held
him
up
try
to
look
into
the
house
he
commanded
a
strong
current
of
air
was
forced
into
a
big
cylinder
which
was
suspended
from
the
ceiling
and
filled
with
molten
iron
as
this
current
rushed
into
the
mess
of
iron
with
an
awful
roar
showers
of
sparks
of
all
colours
spurted
up
in
bunches
in
sprays
in
long
clusters
they
struck
against
the
wall
and
came
splashing
down
over
the
whole
big
room
father
bear
let
the
boy
watch
the
gorgeous
spectacle
until
the
blowing
was
over
and
the
flowing
and
sparkling
red
steel
had
been
poured
into
ingot
moulds
the
boy
was
completely
charmed
by
the
marvellous
display
and
almost
forgot
that
he
was
imprisoned
between
a
bear
two
paws
father
bear
let
him
look
into
the
rolling
mill
he
saw
a
workman
take
a
short
thick
bar
of
iron
at
white
heat
from
a
furnace
opening
and
place
it
under
a
roller
when
the
iron
came
out
from
under
the
roller
it
was
flattened
and
extended
immediately
another
workman
seized
it
and
placed
it
beneath
a
heavier
roller
which
made
it
still
longer
and
thinner
thus
it
was
passed
from
roller
to
roller
squeezed
and
drawn
out
until
finally
it
curled
along
the
floor
like
a
long
red
thread
but
while
the
first
bar
of
iron
was
being
pressed
a
second
was
taken
from
the
furnace
and
placed
under
the
rollers
and
when
this
was
a
little
along
a
third
was
brought
continuously
fresh
threads
came
crawling
over
the
floor
like
hissing
snakes
the
boy
was
dazzled
by
the
iron
but
he
found
it
more
splendid
to
watch
the
workmen
who
dexterously
and
delicately
seized
the
glowing
snakes
with
their
tongs
and
forced
them
under
the
rollers
it
seemed
like
play
for
them
to
handle
the
hissing
iron
i
call
that
real
man
work
the
boy
remarked
to
himself
the
bear
then
let
the
boy
have
a
peep
at
the
furnace
and
the
forge
and
he
became
more
and
more
astonished
as
he
saw
how
the
blacksmiths
handled
iron
and
fire
those
men
have
no
fear
of
heat
and
flames
he
thought
the
workmen
were
sooty
and
grimy
he
fancied
they
were
some
sort
of
firefolk
that
was
why
they
could
bend
and
mould
the
iron
as
they
wished
he
could
not
believe
that
they
were
just
ordinary
men
since
they
had
such
power
they
keep
this
up
day
after
day
night
after
night
said
father
bear
as
he
dropped
wearily
down
on
the
ground
you
can
understand
that
one
gets
rather
tired
of
that
kind
of
thing
i
mighty
glad
that
at
last
i
can
put
an
end
to
it
indeed
said
the
boy
how
will
you
go
about
it
oh
i
thought
that
you
were
going
to
set
fire
to
the
buildings
said
father
bear
that
would
put
an
end
to
all
this
work
and
i
could
remain
in
my
old
home
the
boy
was
all
of
a
shiver
so
it
was
for
this
that
father
bear
had
brought
him
here
if
you
will
set
fire
to
the
i
promise
to
spare
your
life
said
father
bear
but
if
you
do
do
it
i
make
short
work
of
you
the
huge
workshops
were
built
of
brick
and
the
boy
was
thinking
to
himself
that
father
bear
could
command
as
much
as
he
liked
it
was
impossible
to
obey
him
presently
he
saw
that
it
might
not
be
impossible
after
all
just
beyond
them
lay
a
pile
of
chips
and
shavings
to
which
he
could
easily
set
fire
and
beside
it
was
a
wood
pile
that
almost
reached
the
coal
shed
the
coal
shed
extended
over
to
the
workshops
and
if
that
once
caught
fire
the
flames
would
soon
fly
over
to
the
roof
of
the
iron
foundry
everything
combustible
would
burn
the
walls
would
fall
from
the
heat
and
the
machinery
would
be
destroyed
will
you
or
wo
you
demanded
father
bear
the
boy
knew
that
he
ought
to
answer
promptly
that
he
would
not
but
he
also
knew
that
then
the
bear
paws
would
squeeze
him
to
death
therefore
he
replied
i
shall
have
to
think
it
over
very
well
do
so
assented
father
bear
let
me
say
to
you
that
iron
is
the
thing
that
has
given
men
the
advantage
over
us
bears
which
is
another
reason
for
my
wishing
to
put
an
end
to
the
work
here
the
boy
thought
he
would
use
the
delay
to
figure
out
some
plan
of
escape
but
he
was
so
worried
he
could
not
direct
his
thoughts
where
he
would
instead
he
began
to
think
of
the
great
help
that
iron
had
been
to
mankind
they
needed
iron
for
everything
there
was
iron
in
the
plough
that
broke
up
the
field
in
the
axe
that
felled
the
tree
for
building
houses
in
the
scythe
that
mowed
the
grain
and
in
the
knife
which
could
be
turned
to
all
sorts
of
uses
there
was
iron
in
the
horse
bit
in
the
lock
on
the
door
in
the
nails
that
held
furniture
together
in
the
sheathing
that
covered
the
roof
the
rifle
which
drove
away
wild
beasts
was
made
of
iron
also
the
pick
that
had
broken
up
the
mine
iron
covered
the
he
had
seen
at
karlskrona
the
locomotives
steamed
through
the
country
on
iron
rails
the
needle
that
had
stitched
his
coat
was
of
iron
the
shears
that
clipped
the
sheep
and
the
kettle
that
cooked
the
food
big
and
little
alike
much
that
was
indispensable
was
made
from
iron
father
bear
was
perfectly
right
in
saying
that
it
was
the
iron
that
had
given
men
their
mastery
over
the
bears
now
will
you
or
wo
you
father
bear
repeated
the
boy
was
startled
from
his
musing
here
he
stood
thinking
of
matters
that
were
entirely
unnecessary
and
had
not
yet
found
a
way
to
save
himself
you
must
be
so
impatient
he
said
this
is
a
serious
matter
for
me
and
i
got
to
have
time
to
consider
well
then
consider
another
moment
said
father
bear
but
let
me
tell
you
that
it
because
of
the
iron
that
men
have
become
so
much
wiser
than
we
bears
for
this
alone
if
for
nothing
else
i
should
like
to
put
a
stop
to
the
work
here
again
the
boy
endeavoured
to
think
out
a
plan
of
escape
but
his
thoughts
wandered
willy
nilly
they
were
taken
up
with
the
iron
and
gradually
he
began
to
comprehend
how
much
thinking
and
calculating
men
must
have
done
before
they
discovered
how
to
produce
iron
from
ore
and
he
seemed
to
see
sooty
blacksmiths
of
old
bending
over
the
forge
pondering
how
they
should
properly
handle
it
perhaps
it
was
because
they
had
thought
so
much
about
the
iron
that
intelligence
had
been
developed
in
mankind
until
finally
they
became
so
advanced
that
they
were
able
to
build
great
works
like
these
the
fact
was
that
men
owed
more
to
the
iron
than
they
themselves
knew
well
what
say
you
will
you
or
wo
you
insisted
father
bear
the
boy
shrank
back
here
he
stood
thinking
needless
thoughts
and
had
no
idea
as
to
what
he
should
do
to
save
himself
it
not
such
an
easy
matter
to
decide
as
you
think
he
answered
you
must
give
me
time
for
reflection
i
can
wait
for
you
a
little
longer
said
father
bear
but
after
that
you
get
no
more
grace
you
must
know
that
it
the
fault
of
the
iron
that
the
human
kind
can
live
here
on
the
property
of
the
bears
and
now
you
understand
why
i
would
be
rid
of
the
work
the
boy
meant
to
use
the
last
moment
to
think
out
some
way
to
save
himself
but
anxious
and
distraught
as
he
was
his
thoughts
wandered
again
now
he
began
thinking
of
all
that
he
had
seen
when
he
flew
over
the
mining
districts
it
was
strange
that
there
should
be
so
much
life
and
activity
and
so
much
work
back
there
in
the
wilderness
just
think
how
poor
and
desolate
this
place
would
be
had
there
been
no
iron
here
this
very
foundry
gave
employment
to
many
and
had
gathered
around
it
many
homes
filled
with
people
who
in
turn
had
attracted
hither
railways
and
telegraph
wires
and
come
come
growled
the
bear
will
you
or
wo
you
the
boy
swept
his
hand
across
his
forehead
no
plan
of
escape
had
as
yet
come
to
his
mind
but
this
much
he
knew
he
did
not
wish
to
do
any
harm
to
the
iron
which
was
so
useful
to
rich
and
poor
alike
and
which
gave
bread
to
so
many
people
in
this
land
i
wo
he
said
father
bear
squeezed
him
a
little
harder
but
said
nothing
you
not
get
me
to
destroy
the
ironworks
defied
the
boy
the
iron
is
so
great
a
blessing
that
it
will
never
do
to
harm
it
then
of
course
you
do
expect
to
be
allowed
to
live
very
long
said
the
bear
no
i
do
expect
it
returned
the
boy
looking
the
bear
straight
in
the
eye
father
bear
gripped
him
still
harder
it
hurt
so
that
the
boy
could
not
keep
the
tears
back
but
he
did
not
cry
out
or
say
a
word
very
well
then
said
father
bear
raising
his
paw
very
slowly
hoping
that
the
boy
would
give
in
at
the
last
moment
but
just
then
the
boy
heard
something
click
very
close
to
them
and
saw
the
muzzle
of
a
rifle
two
paces
away
both
he
and
father
bear
had
been
so
engrossed
in
their
own
affairs
they
had
not
observed
that
a
man
had
stolen
right
upon
them
father
bear
do
you
hear
the
clicking
of
a
trigger
cried
the
boy
run
or
you
be
shot
father
bear
grew
terribly
hurried
however
he
allowed
himself
time
enough
to
pick
up
the
boy
and
carry
him
along
as
he
ran
a
couple
of
shots
sounded
and
the
bullets
grazed
his
ears
but
luckily
he
escaped
the
boy
thought
as
he
was
dangling
from
the
bear
mouth
that
never
had
he
been
so
stupid
as
he
was
if
he
had
only
kept
still
the
bear
would
have
been
shot
and
he
himself
would
have
been
freed
but
he
had
become
so
accustomed
to
helping
the
animals
that
he
did
it
naturally
and
as
a
matter
of
course
when
father
bear
had
run
some
distance
into
the
woods
he
paused
and
set
the
boy
down
on
the
ground
thank
you
little
one
he
said
i
dare
say
those
bullets
would
have
caught
me
if
you
had
been
there
and
now
i
want
to
do
you
a
service
in
return
if
you
should
ever
meet
with
another
bear
just
say
to
him
this
which
i
shall
whisper
to
you
and
he
wo
touch
you
father
bear
whispered
a
word
or
two
into
the
boy
ear
and
hurried
away
for
he
thought
he
heard
hounds
and
hunters
pursuing
him
the
boy
stood
in
the
forest
free
and
unharmed
and
could
hardly
understand
how
it
was
possible
the
wild
geese
had
been
flying
back
and
forth
the
whole
evening
peering
and
calling
but
they
had
been
unable
to
find
thumbietot
they
searched
long
after
the
sun
had
set
and
finally
when
it
had
grown
so
dark
that
they
were
forced
to
alight
somewhere
for
the
night
they
were
very
downhearted
there
was
not
one
among
them
but
thought
the
boy
had
been
killed
by
the
fall
and
was
lying
dead
in
the
forest
where
they
could
not
see
him
but
the
next
morning
when
the
sun
peeped
over
the
hills
and
awakened
the
wild
geese
the
boy
lay
sleeping
as
usual
in
their
midst
when
he
woke
and
heard
them
shrieking
and
cackling
their
astonishment
he
could
not
help
laughing
they
were
so
eager
to
know
what
had
happened
to
him
that
they
did
not
care
to
go
to
breakfast
until
he
had
told
them
the
whole
story
the
boy
soon
narrated
his
entire
adventure
with
the
bears
but
after
that
he
seemed
reluctant
to
continue
how
i
got
back
to
you
perhaps
you
already
know
he
said
no
we
know
nothing
we
thought
you
were
killed
that
curious
remarked
the
boy
oh
yes
when
father
bear
left
me
i
climbed
up
into
a
pine
and
fell
asleep
at
daybreak
i
was
awakened
by
an
eagle
hovering
over
me
he
picked
me
up
with
his
talons
and
carried
me
away
he
did
hurt
me
but
flew
straight
here
to
you
and
dropped
me
down
among
you
did
he
tell
you
who
he
was
asked
the
big
white
gander
he
was
gone
before
i
had
time
even
to
thank
him
i
thought
that
mother
akka
had
sent
him
after
me
how
extraordinary
exclaimed
the
white
but
are
you
certain
that
it
was
an
eagle
i
had
never
before
seen
an
eagle
said
the
boy
but
he
was
so
big
and
splendid
that
i
ca
give
him
a
lowlier
name
morten
turned
to
the
wild
geese
to
hear
what
they
thought
of
this
but
they
stood
gazing
into
the
air
as
though
they
were
thinking
of
something
else
we
must
not
forget
entirely
to
eat
breakfast
today
said
akka
quickly
spreading
her
wings
the
flood
the
swans
first
to
there
was
a
terrible
storm
raging
in
the
district
north
of
lake
mälar
which
lasted
several
days
the
sky
was
a
dull
gray
the
wind
whistled
and
the
rain
beat
both
people
and
animals
knew
the
spring
could
not
be
ushered
in
with
anything
short
of
this
nevertheless
they
thought
it
unbearable
after
it
had
been
raining
for
a
whole
day
the
snowdrifts
in
the
pine
forests
began
to
melt
in
earnest
and
the
spring
brooks
grew
lively
all
the
pools
on
the
farms
the
standing
water
in
the
ditches
the
water
that
oozed
between
the
tufts
in
marshes
and
swamps
all
were
in
motion
and
tried
to
find
their
way
to
creeks
that
they
might
be
borne
along
to
the
sea
the
creeks
rushed
as
fast
as
possible
down
to
the
rivers
and
the
rivers
did
their
utmost
to
carry
the
water
to
lake
mälar
all
the
lakes
and
rivers
in
uppland
and
the
mining
district
quickly
threw
off
their
ice
covers
on
one
and
the
same
day
so
that
the
creeks
filled
with
which
rose
clear
up
to
their
banks
swollen
as
they
were
they
emptied
into
lake
mälar
and
it
was
not
long
before
the
lake
had
taken
in
as
much
water
as
it
could
well
hold
down
by
the
outlet
was
a
raging
torrent
norrström
is
a
narrow
channel
and
it
could
not
let
out
the
water
quickly
enough
besides
there
was
a
strong
easterly
wind
that
lashed
against
the
land
obstructing
the
stream
when
it
tried
to
carry
the
fresh
water
into
the
east
sea
since
the
rivers
kept
running
to
mälaren
with
more
water
than
it
could
dispose
of
there
was
nothing
for
the
big
lake
to
do
but
overflow
its
banks
it
rose
very
slowly
as
if
reluctant
to
injure
its
beautiful
shores
but
as
they
were
mostly
low
and
gradually
sloping
it
was
not
long
before
the
water
had
flooded
several
acres
of
land
and
that
was
enough
to
create
the
greatest
alarm
lake
mälar
is
unique
in
its
way
being
made
up
of
a
succession
of
narrow
fiords
bays
and
inlets
in
no
place
does
it
spread
into
a
storm
centre
but
seems
to
have
been
created
only
for
pleasure
trips
yachting
tours
and
fishing
nowhere
does
it
present
barren
desolate
shores
it
looks
as
if
it
never
thought
that
its
shores
could
hold
anything
but
country
seats
summer
villas
manors
and
amusement
resorts
but
because
it
usually
presents
a
very
agreeable
and
friendly
appearance
there
is
all
the
more
havoc
whenever
it
happens
to
drop
its
smiling
expression
in
the
spring
and
show
that
it
can
be
serious
at
that
critical
time
smirre
fox
happened
to
come
sneaking
through
a
birch
grove
just
north
of
lake
mälar
as
usual
he
was
thinking
of
thumbietot
and
the
wild
geese
and
wondering
how
he
should
ever
find
them
again
he
had
lost
all
track
of
them
as
he
stole
cautiously
along
more
discouraged
than
usual
he
caught
sight
of
agar
the
who
had
perched
herself
on
a
birch
branch
my
but
i
in
luck
to
run
across
you
agar
exclaimed
smirre
maybe
you
can
tell
me
where
akka
from
kebnekaise
and
her
flock
hold
forth
nowadays
it
quite
possible
that
i
know
where
they
are
agar
hinted
but
not
likely
to
tell
you
please
yourself
retorted
smirre
nevertheless
you
can
take
a
message
that
i
have
for
them
you
probably
know
the
present
condition
of
lake
mälar
there
a
great
overflow
down
there
and
all
the
swans
who
live
in
hjälsta
bay
are
about
to
see
their
nests
with
all
their
eggs
destroyed
daylight
the
has
heard
of
the
midget
who
travels
with
the
wild
geese
and
knows
a
remedy
for
every
ill
he
has
sent
me
to
ask
akka
if
she
will
bring
thumbietot
down
to
hjälsta
bay
i
dare
say
i
can
convey
your
message
agar
replied
but
i
understand
how
the
little
boy
will
be
able
to
help
the
swans
nor
do
i
said
smirre
but
he
can
do
almost
everything
it
seems
it
surprising
to
me
that
daylight
should
send
his
messages
by
a
fox
agar
remarked
well
we
not
exactly
what
you
call
good
friends
said
smirre
smoothly
but
in
an
emergency
like
this
we
must
help
each
other
perhaps
it
would
be
just
as
well
not
to
tell
akka
that
you
got
the
message
from
a
fox
between
you
and
me
she
inclined
to
be
a
little
suspicious
the
safest
refuge
for
in
the
whole
mälar
district
is
hjälsta
bay
it
has
low
shores
shallow
water
and
is
also
covered
with
reeds
it
is
by
no
means
as
large
as
lake
tåkern
but
nevertheless
hjälsta
is
a
good
retreat
for
birds
since
it
has
long
been
forbidden
territory
to
hunters
it
is
the
home
of
a
great
many
swans
and
the
owner
of
the
old
castle
nearby
has
prohibited
all
shooting
on
the
bay
so
that
they
might
be
unmolested
as
soon
as
akka
received
word
that
the
swans
needed
her
help
she
hastened
down
to
hjälsta
bay
she
arrived
with
her
flock
one
evening
and
saw
at
a
glance
that
there
had
been
a
great
disaster
the
big
nests
had
been
torn
away
and
the
strong
wind
was
driving
them
down
the
bay
some
had
already
fallen
apart
two
or
three
had
capsized
and
the
eggs
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
lake
when
akka
alighted
on
the
bay
all
the
swans
living
there
were
gathered
near
the
eastern
shore
where
they
were
protected
from
the
wind
although
they
had
suffered
much
by
the
flood
they
were
too
proud
to
let
any
one
see
it
it
is
useless
to
cry
they
said
there
are
plenty
of
and
stems
here
we
can
soon
build
new
nests
none
had
thought
of
asking
a
stranger
to
help
them
and
the
swans
had
no
idea
that
smirre
fox
had
sent
for
the
wild
geese
there
were
several
hundred
swans
resting
on
the
water
they
had
placed
themselves
according
to
rank
and
station
the
young
and
inexperienced
were
farthest
out
the
old
and
wise
nearer
the
middle
of
the
group
and
right
in
the
centre
sat
daylight
the
and
the
who
were
older
than
any
of
the
others
and
regarded
the
rest
of
the
swans
as
their
children
the
geese
alighted
on
the
west
shore
of
the
bay
but
when
akka
saw
where
the
swans
were
she
swam
toward
them
at
once
she
was
very
much
surprised
at
their
having
sent
for
her
but
she
regarded
it
as
an
honour
and
did
not
wish
to
lose
a
moment
in
coming
to
their
aid
as
akka
approached
the
swans
she
paused
to
see
if
the
geese
who
followed
her
swam
in
a
straight
line
and
at
even
distances
apart
now
swim
along
quickly
she
ordered
do
stare
at
the
swans
as
if
you
had
never
before
seen
anything
beautiful
and
do
mind
what
they
may
say
to
you
this
was
not
the
first
time
that
akka
had
called
on
the
aristocratic
swans
they
had
always
received
her
in
a
manner
befitting
a
great
traveller
like
herself
but
still
she
did
not
like
the
idea
of
swimming
in
among
them
she
never
felt
so
gray
and
insignificant
as
when
she
happened
upon
swans
one
or
another
of
them
was
sure
to
drop
a
remark
about
common
and
poor
folk
but
it
is
always
best
to
take
no
notice
of
such
things
this
time
everything
passed
off
uncommonly
well
the
swans
politely
made
way
for
the
wild
geese
who
swam
forward
through
a
kind
of
passageway
which
formed
an
avenue
bordered
by
shimmering
white
birds
it
was
a
beautiful
sight
to
watch
them
as
they
spread
their
wings
like
sails
to
appear
well
before
the
strangers
they
refrained
from
making
comments
which
rather
surprised
akka
evidently
daylight
had
noted
their
misbehaviour
in
the
past
and
had
told
the
swans
that
they
must
conduct
themselves
in
a
proper
manner
so
thought
the
but
just
as
the
swans
were
making
an
effort
to
observe
the
rules
of
etiquette
they
caught
sight
of
the
who
swam
last
in
the
long
then
there
was
a
murmur
of
disapproval
even
of
threats
among
the
swans
and
at
once
there
was
an
end
to
their
good
deportment
what
this
shrieked
one
do
the
wild
geese
intend
to
dress
up
in
white
feathers
they
need
think
that
will
make
swans
of
them
cried
another
they
began
shrieking
one
louder
than
another
in
their
strong
resonant
voices
it
was
impossible
to
explain
that
a
tame
had
come
with
the
wild
geese
that
must
be
the
himself
coming
along
they
said
tauntingly
there
no
limit
to
their
audacity
that
no
goose
it
only
a
tame
duck
the
big
white
gander
remembered
akka
admonition
to
pay
no
attention
no
matter
what
he
might
hear
he
kept
quiet
and
swam
ahead
as
fast
he
could
but
it
did
no
good
the
swans
became
more
and
more
impertinent
what
kind
of
a
frog
does
he
carry
on
his
back
asked
one
they
must
think
we
do
see
it
a
frog
because
it
is
dressed
like
a
human
being
the
swans
who
but
a
moment
before
had
been
resting
in
such
perfect
order
now
swam
up
and
down
excitedly
all
tried
to
crowd
forward
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
white
wild
goose
that
white
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
come
here
and
parade
before
swans
he
probably
as
gray
as
the
rest
of
them
he
has
only
been
in
a
flour
barrel
at
some
farm
house
akka
had
just
come
up
to
daylight
and
was
about
to
ask
him
what
kind
of
help
he
wanted
of
her
when
the
noticed
the
uproar
among
the
swans
what
do
i
see
have
i
taught
you
to
be
polite
to
strangers
he
said
with
a
frown
the
swam
out
to
restore
order
among
her
subjects
and
again
daylight
turned
to
akka
presently
came
back
appearing
greatly
agitated
ca
you
keep
them
quiet
shouted
daylight
there
a
white
wild
goose
over
there
answered
is
it
not
shameful
i
do
wonder
they
are
furious
a
white
wild
goose
scoffed
daylight
that
too
ridiculous
there
ca
be
such
a
thing
you
must
be
mistaken
the
crowds
around
morten
grew
larger
and
larger
akka
and
the
other
wild
geese
tried
to
swim
over
to
him
but
were
jostled
hither
and
thither
and
could
not
get
to
him
the
old
who
was
the
strongest
among
them
swam
off
quickly
pushed
all
the
others
aside
and
made
his
way
over
to
the
big
white
gander
but
when
he
saw
that
there
really
was
a
white
goose
on
the
water
he
was
just
as
indignant
as
the
rest
he
hissed
with
rage
flew
straight
at
morten
and
tore
out
a
few
feathers
i
teach
you
a
lesson
wild
goose
he
shrieked
so
that
you
not
come
again
to
the
swans
togged
out
in
this
way
fly
morten
fly
fly
cried
akka
for
she
knew
that
otherwise
the
swans
would
pull
out
every
feather
the
had
fly
fly
screamed
thumbietot
too
but
the
was
so
hedged
in
by
the
swans
that
he
had
not
room
enough
to
spread
his
wings
all
around
him
the
swans
stretched
their
long
necks
opened
their
strong
bills
and
plucked
his
feathers
morten
defended
himself
as
best
he
could
by
striking
and
biting
the
wild
geese
also
began
to
fight
the
swans
it
was
obvious
how
this
would
have
ended
had
the
geese
not
received
help
quite
unexpectedly
a
noticed
that
they
were
being
roughly
treated
by
the
swans
instantly
he
cried
out
the
shrill
call
that
little
birds
use
when
they
need
help
to
drive
off
a
hawk
or
a
falcon
three
calls
had
barely
sounded
when
all
the
little
birds
in
the
vicinity
came
shooting
down
to
hjälsta
bay
as
if
on
wings
of
lightning
these
delicate
little
creatures
swooped
down
upon
the
swans
screeched
in
their
ears
and
obstructed
their
view
with
the
flutter
of
their
tiny
wings
they
made
them
dizzy
with
their
fluttering
and
drove
them
to
distraction
with
their
cries
of
shame
shame
swans
the
attack
of
the
small
birds
lasted
but
a
moment
when
they
were
gone
and
the
swans
came
to
their
senses
they
saw
that
the
geese
had
risen
and
flown
over
to
the
other
end
of
the
bay
the
new
there
was
this
at
least
to
be
said
in
the
swans
favour
when
they
saw
that
the
wild
geese
had
escaped
they
were
too
proud
to
chase
them
moreover
the
geese
could
stand
on
a
clump
of
reeds
with
perfect
composure
and
sleep
nils
holgersson
was
too
hungry
to
sleep
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
get
something
to
eat
he
said
at
that
time
when
all
kinds
of
things
were
floating
on
the
water
it
was
not
difficult
for
a
little
boy
like
nils
holgersson
to
find
a
craft
he
did
not
stop
to
deliberate
but
hopped
down
on
a
stump
that
had
drifted
in
amongst
the
reeds
then
he
picked
up
a
little
stick
and
began
to
pole
toward
shore
just
as
he
was
landing
he
heard
a
splash
in
the
water
he
stopped
short
first
he
saw
a
lady
swan
asleep
in
her
big
nest
quite
close
to
him
then
he
noticed
that
a
fox
had
taken
a
few
steps
into
the
water
and
was
sneaking
up
to
the
swan
nest
hi
hi
hi
get
up
get
up
cried
the
boy
beating
the
water
with
his
stick
the
lady
swan
rose
but
not
so
quickly
but
that
the
fox
could
have
pounced
upon
her
had
he
cared
to
however
he
refrained
and
instead
hurried
straight
toward
the
boy
thumbietot
saw
the
fox
coming
and
ran
for
his
life
wide
stretches
of
meadow
land
spread
before
him
he
saw
no
tree
that
he
could
climb
no
hole
where
he
might
hide
he
just
had
to
keep
running
the
boy
was
a
good
runner
but
it
stands
to
reason
that
he
could
not
race
with
a
fox
not
far
from
the
bay
there
were
a
number
of
little
cabins
with
candle
lights
shining
through
the
windows
naturally
the
boy
ran
in
that
direction
but
he
realized
that
long
before
he
could
reach
the
nearest
cabin
the
fox
would
catch
up
to
him
once
the
fox
was
so
close
that
it
looked
as
if
the
boy
would
surely
be
his
prey
but
nils
quickly
sprang
aside
and
turned
back
toward
the
bay
by
that
move
the
fox
lost
time
and
before
he
could
reach
the
boy
the
latter
had
run
up
to
two
men
who
were
on
their
way
home
from
work
the
men
were
tired
and
sleepy
they
had
noticed
neither
boy
nor
fox
although
both
had
been
running
right
in
front
of
them
nor
did
the
boy
ask
help
of
the
men
he
was
content
to
walk
close
beside
them
surely
the
fox
wo
venture
to
come
up
to
the
men
he
thought
but
presently
the
fox
came
pattering
along
he
probably
counted
on
the
men
taking
him
for
a
dog
for
he
went
straight
up
to
them
whose
dog
can
that
be
sneaking
around
here
queried
one
he
looks
as
though
he
were
ready
to
bite
the
other
paused
and
glanced
back
go
along
with
you
he
said
and
gave
the
fox
a
kick
that
sent
it
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
what
are
you
doing
here
after
that
the
fox
kept
at
a
safe
distance
but
followed
all
the
while
presently
the
men
reached
a
cabin
and
entered
it
the
boy
intended
to
go
in
with
them
but
when
he
got
to
the
stoop
he
saw
a
big
shaggy
rush
out
from
his
kennel
to
greet
his
master
suddenly
the
boy
changed
his
mind
and
remained
out
in
the
open
listen
whispered
the
boy
as
soon
as
the
men
had
shut
the
door
i
wonder
if
you
would
like
to
help
me
catch
a
fox
the
dog
had
poor
eyesight
and
had
become
irritable
and
cranky
from
being
chained
what
i
catch
a
fox
he
barked
angrily
who
are
you
that
makes
fun
of
me
you
just
come
within
my
reach
and
i
teach
you
not
to
fool
with
me
you
need
think
that
i
afraid
to
come
near
you
said
the
boy
running
up
to
the
dog
when
the
dog
saw
him
he
was
so
astonished
that
he
could
not
speak
i
the
one
they
call
thumbietot
who
travels
with
the
wild
geese
said
the
boy
introducing
himself
have
you
heard
of
me
i
believe
the
sparrows
have
twittered
a
little
about
you
the
dog
returned
they
say
that
you
have
done
wonderful
things
for
one
of
your
size
i
been
rather
lucky
up
to
the
present
admitted
the
boy
but
now
it
all
up
with
me
unless
you
help
me
there
a
fox
at
my
heels
lying
in
wait
for
me
around
the
corner
do
you
suppose
i
can
smell
him
retorted
the
dog
but
we
soon
be
rid
of
him
with
that
the
dog
sprang
as
far
as
the
chain
would
allow
barking
and
growling
for
ever
so
long
now
i
do
think
he
will
show
his
face
again
said
the
dog
it
will
take
something
besides
a
fine
bark
to
scare
that
fox
the
boy
remarked
he
soon
be
here
again
and
that
is
precisely
what
i
wish
for
i
have
set
my
heart
on
your
catching
him
are
you
poking
fun
at
me
now
asked
the
dog
only
come
with
me
into
your
kennel
and
i
tell
you
what
to
do
the
boy
and
the
crept
into
the
kennel
and
crouched
there
whispering
by
and
by
the
fox
stuck
his
nose
out
from
his
hiding
place
when
all
was
quiet
he
crept
along
cautiously
he
scented
the
boy
all
the
way
to
the
kennel
but
halted
at
a
safe
distance
and
sat
down
to
think
of
some
way
to
coax
him
out
suddenly
the
poked
his
head
out
and
growled
at
him
go
away
or
i
catch
you
i
sit
here
as
long
as
i
please
for
all
of
you
defied
the
fox
go
away
repeated
the
dog
threateningly
or
there
will
be
no
more
hunting
for
you
after
but
the
fox
only
grinned
and
did
not
move
an
inch
i
know
how
far
your
chain
can
reach
he
said
i
have
warned
you
twice
said
the
dog
coming
out
from
his
kennel
now
blame
yourself
with
that
the
dog
sprang
at
the
fox
and
caught
him
without
the
least
effort
for
he
was
loose
the
boy
had
unbuckled
his
collar
there
was
a
hot
struggle
but
it
was
soon
over
the
dog
was
the
victor
the
fox
lay
on
the
ground
and
dared
not
move
do
stir
or
i
kill
you
snarled
the
dog
then
he
took
the
fox
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
dragged
him
to
the
kennel
there
the
boy
was
ready
with
the
chain
he
placed
the
dog
collar
around
the
neck
of
the
fox
tightening
it
so
that
he
was
securely
chained
during
all
this
the
fox
had
to
lie
still
for
he
was
afraid
to
move
now
smirre
fox
i
hope
you
make
a
good
laughed
the
boy
when
he
had
finished
dunfin
the
city
that
floats
on
the
water
may
no
one
could
be
more
gentle
and
kind
than
the
little
gray
goose
dunfin
all
the
wild
geese
loved
her
and
the
tame
white
would
have
died
for
her
when
dunfin
asked
for
anything
not
even
akka
could
say
no
as
soon
as
dunfin
came
to
lake
mälar
the
landscape
looked
familiar
to
her
just
beyond
the
lake
lay
the
sea
with
many
wooded
islands
and
there
on
a
little
islet
lived
her
parents
and
her
brothers
and
sisters
she
begged
the
wild
geese
to
fly
to
her
home
before
travelling
farther
north
that
she
might
let
her
family
see
that
she
was
still
alive
it
would
be
such
a
joy
to
them
akka
frankly
declared
that
she
thought
dunfin
parents
and
brothers
and
sisters
had
shown
no
great
love
for
her
when
they
abandoned
her
at
öland
but
dunfin
would
not
admit
that
akka
was
in
the
right
what
else
was
there
to
do
when
they
saw
that
i
could
not
fly
she
protested
surely
they
could
remain
at
öland
on
my
account
dunfin
began
telling
the
wild
geese
all
about
her
home
in
the
archipelago
to
try
to
induce
them
to
make
the
trip
her
family
lived
on
a
rock
island
seen
from
a
distance
there
appeared
to
be
nothing
but
stone
there
but
when
one
came
closer
there
were
to
be
found
the
choicest
goose
tidbits
in
clefts
and
hollows
and
one
might
search
long
for
better
nesting
places
than
those
that
were
hidden
in
the
mountain
crevices
or
among
the
osier
bushes
but
the
best
of
all
was
the
old
fisherman
who
lived
there
dunfin
had
heard
that
in
his
youth
he
had
been
a
great
shot
and
had
always
lain
in
the
offing
and
hunted
birds
but
now
in
his
old
age
since
his
wife
had
died
and
the
children
had
gone
from
home
so
that
he
was
alone
in
the
hut
he
had
begun
to
care
for
the
birds
on
his
island
he
never
fired
a
shot
at
them
nor
would
he
permit
others
to
do
so
he
walked
around
amongst
the
birds
nests
and
when
the
mother
birds
were
sitting
he
brought
them
food
not
one
was
afraid
of
him
they
all
loved
him
dunfin
had
been
in
his
hut
many
times
and
he
had
fed
her
with
bread
crumbs
because
he
was
kind
to
the
birds
they
flocked
to
his
island
in
such
great
numbers
that
it
was
becoming
overcrowded
if
one
happened
to
arrive
a
little
late
in
the
spring
all
the
nesting
places
were
occupied
that
was
why
dunfin
family
had
been
obliged
to
leave
her
dunfin
begged
so
hard
that
she
finally
had
her
way
although
the
wild
geese
felt
that
they
were
losing
time
and
really
should
be
going
straight
north
but
a
little
trip
like
this
to
the
cliff
island
would
not
delay
them
more
than
a
day
so
they
started
off
one
morning
after
fortifying
themselves
with
a
good
breakfast
and
flew
eastward
over
lake
mälar
the
boy
did
not
know
for
certain
where
they
were
going
but
he
noticed
that
the
farther
east
they
flew
the
livelier
it
was
on
the
lake
and
the
more
built
up
were
the
shores
heavily
freighted
barges
and
sloops
boats
and
fishing
smacks
were
on
their
way
east
and
these
were
met
and
passed
by
many
pretty
white
steamers
along
the
shores
ran
country
roads
and
railway
tracks
all
in
the
same
direction
there
was
some
place
beyond
in
the
east
where
all
wished
to
go
to
in
the
morning
on
one
of
the
islands
the
boy
saw
a
big
white
castle
and
to
the
east
of
it
the
shores
were
dotted
with
villas
at
the
start
these
lay
far
apart
then
they
became
closer
and
closer
and
presently
the
whole
shore
was
lined
with
them
they
were
of
every
variety
here
a
castle
there
a
cottage
then
a
low
manor
house
appeared
or
a
mansion
with
many
small
towers
some
stood
in
gardens
but
most
of
them
were
in
the
wild
woods
which
bordered
the
shores
despite
their
dissimilarity
they
had
one
point
of
resemblance
they
were
not
plain
and
like
other
buildings
but
were
gaudily
painted
in
striking
greens
and
blues
reds
and
white
like
children
playhouses
as
the
boy
sat
on
the
goose
back
and
glanced
down
at
the
curious
shore
mansions
dunfin
cried
out
with
delight
now
i
know
where
i
am
over
there
lies
the
city
that
floats
on
the
water
the
boy
looked
ahead
at
first
he
saw
nothing
but
some
light
clouds
and
mists
rolling
forward
over
the
water
but
soon
he
caught
sight
of
some
tall
spires
and
then
one
and
another
house
with
many
rows
of
windows
they
appeared
and
disappeared
rolling
hither
and
thither
but
not
a
strip
of
shore
did
he
see
everything
over
there
appeared
to
be
resting
on
the
water
nearer
to
the
city
he
saw
no
more
pretty
playhouses
along
the
shores
only
dingy
factories
great
heaps
of
coal
and
wood
were
stacked
behind
tall
planks
and
alongside
black
sooty
docks
lay
bulky
freight
steamers
but
over
all
was
spread
a
shimmering
transparent
mist
which
made
everything
appear
so
big
and
strong
and
wonderful
that
it
was
almost
beautiful
the
wild
geese
flew
past
factories
and
freight
steamers
and
were
nearing
the
spires
suddenly
all
the
mists
sank
to
the
water
save
the
thin
fleecy
ones
that
circled
above
their
heads
beautifully
tinted
in
blues
and
pinks
the
other
clouds
rolled
over
water
and
land
they
entirely
obscured
the
lower
portions
of
the
houses
only
the
upper
stories
and
the
roofs
and
gables
were
visible
some
of
the
buildings
appeared
to
be
as
high
as
the
tower
of
babel
the
boy
no
doubt
knew
that
they
were
built
upon
hills
and
mountains
but
these
he
did
not
see
only
the
houses
that
seemed
to
float
among
the
white
drifting
clouds
in
reality
the
buildings
were
dark
and
dingy
for
the
sun
in
the
east
was
not
shining
on
them
the
boy
knew
that
he
was
riding
above
a
large
city
for
he
saw
spires
and
house
roofs
rising
from
the
clouds
in
every
direction
sometimes
an
opening
was
made
in
the
circling
mists
and
he
looked
down
into
a
running
tortuous
stream
but
no
land
could
he
see
all
this
was
beautiful
to
look
upon
but
he
felt
quite
distraught
as
one
does
when
happening
upon
something
one
can
not
understand
when
he
had
gone
beyond
the
city
he
found
that
the
ground
was
no
longer
hidden
by
clouds
but
that
shores
streams
and
islands
were
again
plainly
visible
he
turned
to
see
the
city
better
but
could
not
for
now
it
looked
quite
enchanted
the
mists
had
taken
on
colour
from
the
sunshine
and
were
rolling
forward
in
the
most
brilliant
reds
blues
and
yellows
the
houses
were
white
as
if
built
of
light
and
the
windows
and
spires
sparkled
like
fire
all
things
floated
on
the
water
as
before
the
geese
were
travelling
straight
east
they
flew
over
factories
and
workshops
then
over
mansions
edging
the
shores
steamboats
and
tugs
swarmed
on
the
water
but
now
they
came
from
the
east
and
were
steaming
westward
toward
the
city
the
wild
geese
flew
on
but
instead
of
the
narrow
mälar
fiords
and
the
little
islands
broader
waters
and
larger
islands
spread
under
them
at
last
the
land
was
left
behind
and
seen
no
more
they
flew
still
farther
out
where
they
found
no
more
large
inhabited
islands
only
numberless
little
rock
islands
were
scattered
on
the
water
now
the
fiords
were
not
crowded
by
the
land
the
sea
lay
before
them
vast
and
limitless
here
the
wild
geese
alighted
on
a
cliff
island
and
as
soon
as
their
feet
touched
the
ground
the
boy
turned
to
dunfin
what
city
did
we
fly
over
just
now
he
asked
i
do
know
what
human
beings
have
named
it
said
dunfin
we
gray
geese
call
it
the
that
floats
on
the
water
the
sisters
dunfin
had
two
sisters
prettywing
and
goldeye
they
were
strong
and
intelligent
birds
but
they
did
not
have
such
a
soft
and
shiny
feather
dress
as
dunfin
nor
did
they
have
her
sweet
and
gentle
disposition
from
the
time
they
had
been
little
yellow
goslings
their
parents
and
relatives
and
even
the
old
fisherman
had
plainly
shown
them
that
they
thought
more
of
dunfin
than
of
them
therefore
the
sisters
had
always
hated
her
when
the
wild
geese
landed
on
the
cliff
island
prettywing
and
goldeye
were
feeding
on
a
bit
of
grass
close
to
the
strand
and
immediately
caught
sight
of
the
strangers
see
sister
goldeye
what
geese
have
come
to
our
island
exclaimed
prettywing
i
have
rarely
seen
such
graceful
birds
do
you
notice
that
they
have
a
white
among
them
did
you
ever
set
eyes
on
a
handsomer
bird
one
could
almost
take
him
for
a
swan
goldeye
agreed
with
her
sister
that
these
were
certainly
very
distinguished
strangers
that
had
come
to
the
island
but
suddenly
she
broke
off
and
called
sister
prettywing
oh
sister
prettywing
you
see
whom
they
bring
with
them
prettywing
also
caught
sight
of
dunfin
and
was
so
astounded
that
she
stood
for
a
long
time
with
her
bill
wide
open
and
only
hissed
it
ca
be
possible
that
it
is
she
how
did
she
manage
to
get
in
with
people
of
that
class
why
we
left
her
at
öland
to
freeze
and
starve
the
worse
of
it
is
she
will
tattle
to
father
and
mother
that
we
flew
so
close
to
her
that
we
knocked
her
wing
out
of
joint
said
goldeye
you
see
that
it
will
end
in
our
being
driven
from
the
island
we
have
nothing
but
trouble
in
store
for
us
now
that
that
young
one
has
come
back
snapped
prettywing
still
i
think
it
would
be
best
for
us
to
appear
as
pleased
as
possible
over
her
return
she
is
so
stupid
that
perhaps
she
did
even
notice
that
we
gave
her
a
push
on
purpose
while
prettywing
and
goldeye
were
talking
in
this
strain
the
wild
geese
had
been
standing
on
the
strand
pluming
their
feathers
after
the
flight
now
they
marched
in
a
long
line
up
the
rocky
shore
to
the
cleft
where
dunfin
parents
usually
stopped
dunfin
parents
were
good
folk
they
had
lived
on
the
island
longer
than
any
one
else
and
it
was
their
habit
to
counsel
and
aid
all
newcomers
they
too
had
seen
the
geese
approach
but
they
had
not
recognized
dunfin
in
the
flock
it
is
strange
to
see
wild
geese
land
on
this
island
remarked
the
it
is
a
fine
flock
that
one
can
see
by
their
flight
but
it
wo
be
easy
to
find
pasturage
for
so
many
said
the
who
was
gentle
and
like
dunfin
when
akka
came
marching
with
her
company
dunfin
parents
went
out
to
meet
her
and
welcome
her
to
the
island
dunfin
flew
from
her
place
at
the
end
of
the
line
and
lit
between
her
parents
mother
and
father
i
here
at
last
she
cried
joyously
do
you
know
dunfin
at
first
the
old
could
not
quite
make
out
what
they
saw
but
when
they
recognized
dunfin
they
were
absurdly
happy
of
course
while
the
wild
geese
and
morten
and
dunfin
were
chattering
excitedly
trying
to
tell
how
she
had
been
rescued
prettywing
and
goldeye
came
running
they
cried
and
pretended
to
be
so
happy
because
dunfin
was
at
home
that
she
was
deeply
moved
the
wild
geese
fared
well
on
the
island
and
decided
not
to
travel
farther
until
the
following
morning
after
a
while
the
sisters
asked
dunfin
if
she
would
come
with
them
and
see
the
places
where
they
intended
to
build
their
nests
she
promptly
accompanied
them
and
saw
that
they
had
picked
out
secluded
and
well
protected
nesting
places
now
where
will
you
settle
down
dunfin
they
asked
i
why
i
do
intend
to
remain
on
the
island
she
said
i
going
with
the
wild
geese
up
to
lapland
what
a
pity
that
you
must
leave
us
said
the
sisters
i
should
have
been
very
glad
to
remain
here
with
father
and
mother
and
you
said
dunfin
had
i
not
promised
the
big
white
what
shrieked
prettywing
are
you
to
have
the
handsome
then
it
is
but
here
goldeye
gave
her
a
sharp
nudge
and
she
stopped
short
the
two
cruel
sisters
had
much
to
talk
about
all
the
afternoon
they
were
furious
because
dunfin
had
a
suitor
like
the
white
they
themselves
had
suitors
but
theirs
were
only
common
gray
geese
and
since
they
had
seen
morten
they
thought
them
so
homely
and
that
they
did
not
wish
even
to
look
at
them
this
will
grieve
me
to
death
whimpered
goldeye
if
at
least
it
had
been
you
sister
prettywing
who
had
captured
him
i
would
rather
see
him
dead
than
to
go
about
here
the
entire
summer
thinking
of
dunfin
capturing
a
white
pouted
prettywing
however
the
sisters
continued
to
appear
very
friendly
toward
dunfin
and
in
the
afternoon
goldeye
took
dunfin
with
her
that
she
might
see
the
one
she
thought
of
marrying
he
not
as
attractive
as
the
one
you
will
have
said
goldeye
but
to
make
up
for
it
one
can
be
certain
that
he
is
what
he
is
what
do
you
mean
goldeye
questioned
dunfin
at
first
goldeye
would
not
explain
what
she
had
meant
but
at
last
she
came
out
with
it
we
have
never
seen
a
white
goose
travel
with
wild
geese
said
the
sister
and
we
wonder
if
he
can
be
bewitched
you
are
very
stupid
retorted
dunfin
indignantly
he
is
a
tame
goose
of
course
he
brings
with
him
one
who
is
bewitched
said
goldeye
and
under
the
circumstances
he
too
must
be
bewitched
are
you
not
afraid
that
he
may
be
a
black
cormorant
she
was
a
good
talker
and
succeeded
in
frightening
dunfin
thoroughly
you
do
mean
what
you
are
saying
pleaded
the
little
gray
goose
you
only
wish
to
frighten
me
i
wish
what
is
for
your
good
dunfin
said
goldeye
i
ca
imagine
anything
worse
than
for
you
to
fly
away
with
a
black
cormorant
but
now
i
shall
tell
you
something
try
to
persuade
him
to
eat
some
of
the
roots
i
have
gathered
here
if
he
is
bewitched
it
will
be
apparent
at
once
if
he
is
not
he
will
remain
as
he
is
the
boy
was
sitting
amongst
the
wild
geese
listening
to
akka
and
the
old
when
dunfin
came
flying
up
to
him
thumbietot
thumbietot
she
cried
morten
is
dying
i
have
killed
him
let
me
get
up
on
your
back
dunfin
and
take
me
to
him
away
they
flew
and
akka
and
the
other
wild
geese
followed
them
when
they
got
to
the
he
was
lying
prostrate
on
the
ground
he
could
not
utter
a
word
only
gasped
for
breath
tickle
him
under
the
gorge
and
slap
him
on
the
back
commanded
akka
the
boy
did
so
and
presently
the
big
white
gander
coughed
up
a
large
white
root
which
had
stuck
in
his
gorge
have
you
been
eating
of
these
asked
akka
pointing
to
some
roots
that
lay
on
the
ground
yes
groaned
the
then
it
was
well
they
stuck
in
your
throat
said
akka
for
they
are
poisonous
had
you
swallowed
them
you
certainly
should
have
died
dunfin
bade
me
eat
them
said
the
my
sister
gave
them
to
me
protested
dunfin
and
she
told
everything
you
must
beware
of
those
sisters
of
yours
dunfin
warned
akka
for
they
wish
you
no
good
depend
upon
it
but
dunfin
was
so
constituted
that
she
could
not
think
evil
of
any
one
and
a
moment
later
when
prettywing
asked
her
to
come
and
meet
her
intended
she
went
with
her
immediately
oh
he
is
as
handsome
as
yours
said
the
sister
but
he
much
more
courageous
and
daring
how
do
you
know
he
is
challenged
dunfin
for
some
time
past
there
has
been
weeping
and
wailing
amongst
the
sea
gulls
and
wild
ducks
on
the
island
every
morning
at
daybreak
a
strange
bird
of
prey
comes
and
carries
off
one
of
them
what
kind
of
a
bird
is
it
asked
dunfin
we
do
know
replied
the
sister
one
of
his
kind
has
never
before
been
seen
on
the
island
and
strange
to
say
he
has
never
attacked
one
of
us
geese
but
now
my
intended
has
made
up
his
mind
to
challenge
him
morning
and
drive
him
away
oh
i
hope
he
succeed
said
dunfin
i
hardly
think
he
will
returned
the
sister
if
my
were
as
big
and
strong
as
yours
i
should
have
hope
do
you
wish
me
to
ask
morten
to
meet
the
strange
bird
asked
dunfin
indeed
i
do
exclaimed
prettywing
excitedly
you
could
render
me
a
greater
service
the
next
morning
the
was
up
before
the
sun
he
stationed
himself
on
the
highest
point
of
the
island
and
peered
in
all
directions
presently
he
saw
a
big
dark
bird
coming
from
the
west
his
wings
were
exceedingly
large
and
it
was
easy
to
tell
that
he
was
an
eagle
the
had
not
expected
a
more
dangerous
adversary
than
an
owl
and
how
he
understood
that
he
could
not
escape
this
encounter
with
his
life
but
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
avoid
a
struggle
with
a
bird
who
was
many
times
stronger
than
himself
the
great
bird
swooped
down
on
a
sea
gull
and
dug
his
talons
into
it
before
the
eagle
could
spread
his
wings
morten
rushed
up
to
him
drop
that
he
shouted
and
do
come
here
again
or
have
me
to
deal
with
what
kind
of
a
lunatic
are
you
said
the
eagle
it
lucky
for
you
that
i
never
fight
with
geese
or
you
would
soon
be
done
for
morten
thought
the
eagle
considered
himself
too
good
to
fight
with
him
and
flew
at
him
incensed
biting
him
on
the
throat
and
beating
him
with
his
wings
this
naturally
the
eagle
would
not
tolerate
and
he
began
to
fight
but
not
with
his
full
strength
the
boy
lay
sleeping
in
the
quarters
where
akka
and
the
other
wild
geese
slept
when
dunfin
called
thumbietot
thumbietot
morten
is
being
torn
to
pieces
by
an
eagle
let
me
get
up
on
your
back
dunfin
and
take
me
to
him
said
the
boy
when
they
arrived
on
the
scene
morten
was
badly
torn
and
bleeding
but
he
was
still
fighting
the
boy
could
not
battle
with
the
eagle
all
that
he
could
do
was
to
seek
more
efficient
help
hurry
dunfin
and
call
akka
and
the
wild
geese
he
cried
the
instant
he
said
that
the
eagle
flew
back
and
stopped
fighting
who
speaking
of
akka
he
asked
he
saw
thumbietot
and
heard
the
wild
geese
honking
so
he
spread
his
wings
tell
akka
i
never
expected
to
run
across
her
or
any
of
her
flock
out
here
in
the
sea
he
said
and
soared
away
in
a
rapid
and
graceful
flight
that
is
the
eagle
who
once
brought
me
back
to
the
wild
geese
the
boy
remarked
gazing
after
the
bird
in
astonishment
the
geese
had
decided
to
leave
the
island
at
dawn
but
first
they
wanted
to
feed
awhile
as
they
walked
about
and
nibbled
a
mountain
duck
came
up
to
dunfin
i
have
a
message
for
you
from
your
sisters
said
the
duck
they
dare
not
show
themselves
among
the
wild
geese
but
they
asked
me
to
remind
you
not
to
leave
the
island
without
calling
on
the
old
fisherman
that
so
exclaimed
dunfin
but
she
was
so
frightened
now
that
she
would
not
go
alone
and
asked
the
and
thumbietot
to
accompany
her
to
the
hut
the
door
was
open
so
dunfin
entered
but
the
others
remained
outside
after
a
moment
they
heard
akka
give
the
signal
to
start
and
called
dunfin
a
gray
goose
came
out
and
flew
with
the
wild
geese
away
from
the
island
they
had
travelled
quite
a
distance
along
the
archipelago
when
the
boy
began
to
wonder
at
the
goose
who
accompanied
them
dunfin
always
flew
lightly
and
noiselessly
but
this
one
laboured
with
heavy
and
noisy
we
are
in
the
wrong
company
it
is
prettywing
that
follows
us
the
boy
had
barely
spoken
when
the
goose
uttered
such
an
ugly
and
angry
shriek
that
all
knew
who
she
was
akka
and
the
others
turned
to
her
but
the
gray
goose
did
not
fly
away
at
once
instead
she
bumped
against
the
big
snatched
thumbietot
and
flew
off
with
him
in
her
bill
there
was
a
wild
chase
over
the
archipelago
prettywing
flew
fast
but
the
wild
geese
were
close
behind
her
and
there
was
no
chance
for
her
to
escape
suddenly
they
saw
a
puff
of
smoke
rise
up
from
the
sea
and
heard
an
explosion
in
their
excitement
they
had
not
noticed
that
they
were
directly
above
a
boat
in
which
a
lone
fisherman
was
seated
however
none
of
the
geese
was
hurt
but
just
there
above
the
boat
prettywing
opened
her
bill
and
dropped
thumbietot
into
the
sea
stockholm
skansen
a
few
years
ago
at
skansen
the
great
park
just
outside
of
stockholm
where
they
have
collected
so
many
wonderful
things
there
lived
a
little
old
man
named
clement
larsson
he
was
from
hälsingland
and
had
come
to
skansen
with
his
fiddle
to
play
folk
dances
and
other
old
melodies
as
a
performer
he
appeared
mostly
in
the
evening
during
the
day
it
was
his
business
to
sit
on
guard
in
one
of
the
many
pretty
peasant
cottages
which
have
been
moved
to
skansen
from
all
parts
of
the
country
in
the
beginning
clement
thought
that
he
fared
better
in
his
old
age
than
he
had
ever
dared
dream
but
after
a
time
he
began
to
dislike
the
place
terribly
especially
while
he
was
on
watch
duty
it
was
all
very
well
when
visitors
came
into
the
cottage
to
look
around
but
some
days
clement
would
sit
for
many
hours
all
alone
then
he
felt
so
homesick
that
he
feared
he
would
have
to
give
up
his
place
he
was
very
poor
and
knew
that
at
home
he
would
become
a
charge
on
the
parish
therefore
he
tried
to
hold
out
as
long
as
he
could
although
he
felt
more
unhappy
from
day
to
day
one
beautiful
evening
in
the
beginning
of
may
clement
had
been
granted
a
few
hours
leave
of
absence
he
was
on
his
way
down
the
steep
hill
leading
out
of
skansen
when
he
met
an
island
fisherman
coming
along
with
his
game
bag
the
fisherman
was
an
active
young
man
who
came
to
skansen
with
seafowl
that
he
had
managed
to
capture
alive
clement
had
met
him
before
many
times
the
fisherman
stopped
clement
to
ask
if
the
superintendent
at
skansen
was
at
home
when
clement
had
replied
he
in
turn
asked
what
choice
thing
the
fisherman
had
in
his
bag
you
can
see
what
i
have
the
fisherman
answered
if
in
return
you
will
give
me
an
idea
as
to
what
i
should
ask
for
it
he
held
open
the
bag
and
clement
peeped
into
it
once
and
again
then
quickly
drew
back
a
step
or
two
good
gracious
ashbjörn
he
exclaimed
how
did
you
catch
that
one
he
remembered
that
when
he
was
a
child
his
mother
used
to
talk
of
the
tiny
folk
who
lived
under
the
cabin
floor
he
was
not
permitted
to
cry
or
to
be
naughty
lest
he
provoke
these
small
people
after
he
was
grown
he
believed
his
mother
had
made
up
these
stories
about
the
elves
to
make
him
behave
himself
but
it
had
been
no
invention
of
his
mother
it
seemed
for
there
in
ashbjörn
bag
lay
one
of
the
tiny
folk
there
was
a
little
of
the
terror
natural
to
childhood
left
in
clement
and
he
felt
a
shudder
run
down
his
spinal
column
as
he
peeped
into
the
bag
ashbjörn
saw
that
he
was
frightened
and
began
to
laugh
but
clement
took
the
matter
seriously
tell
me
ashbjörn
where
you
came
across
him
he
asked
you
may
be
sure
that
i
was
lying
in
wait
for
him
said
ashbjörn
he
came
to
me
i
started
out
early
this
morning
and
took
my
rifle
along
into
the
boat
i
had
just
poled
away
from
the
shore
when
i
sighted
some
wild
geese
coming
from
the
east
shrieking
like
mad
i
sent
them
a
shot
but
hit
none
of
them
instead
this
creature
came
tumbling
down
into
the
water
so
close
to
the
boat
that
i
only
had
to
put
my
hand
out
and
pick
him
up
i
hope
you
did
shoot
him
ashbjörn
oh
no
he
is
well
and
sound
but
when
he
came
down
he
was
a
little
dazed
at
first
so
i
took
advantage
of
that
fact
to
wind
the
ends
of
two
sail
threads
around
his
ankles
and
wrists
so
that
he
could
run
away
here
something
for
skansen
i
thought
instantly
clement
grew
strangely
troubled
as
the
fisherman
talked
all
that
he
had
heard
about
the
tiny
folk
in
his
childhood
of
their
vindictiveness
toward
enemies
and
their
benevolence
toward
friends
came
back
to
him
it
had
never
gone
well
with
those
who
had
attempted
to
hold
one
of
them
captive
you
should
have
let
him
go
at
once
ashbjörn
said
clement
i
came
precious
near
being
forced
to
set
him
free
returned
the
fisherman
you
may
as
well
know
clement
that
the
wild
geese
followed
me
all
the
way
home
and
they
over
the
island
the
whole
morning
as
if
they
wanted
him
back
not
only
they
but
the
entire
population
sea
gulls
sea
swallows
and
many
others
who
are
not
worth
a
shot
of
powder
alighted
on
the
island
and
made
an
awful
racket
when
i
came
out
they
fluttered
about
me
until
i
had
to
turn
back
my
wife
begged
me
to
let
him
go
but
i
had
made
up
my
mind
that
he
should
come
here
to
skansen
so
i
placed
one
of
the
children
dolls
in
the
window
hid
the
midget
in
the
bottom
of
my
bag
and
started
away
the
birds
must
have
fancied
that
it
was
he
who
stood
in
the
window
for
they
permitted
me
to
leave
without
pursuing
me
does
it
say
anything
asked
clement
yes
at
first
he
tried
to
call
to
the
birds
but
i
would
have
it
and
put
a
gag
in
his
mouth
oh
ashbjörn
protested
clement
how
can
you
treat
him
so
do
you
see
that
he
is
something
supernatural
i
do
know
what
he
is
said
ashbjörn
calmly
let
others
consider
that
i
satisfied
if
only
i
can
get
a
good
sum
for
him
now
tell
me
clement
what
you
think
the
doctor
at
skansen
would
give
me
there
was
a
long
pause
before
clement
replied
he
felt
very
sorry
for
the
poor
little
chap
he
actually
imagined
that
his
mother
was
standing
beside
him
telling
him
that
he
must
always
be
kind
to
the
tiny
folk
i
have
no
idea
what
the
doctor
up
there
would
care
to
give
you
ashbjörn
he
said
finally
but
if
you
will
leave
him
with
me
i
pay
you
twenty
kroner
for
him
ashbjörn
stared
at
the
fiddler
in
amazement
when
he
heard
him
name
so
large
a
sum
he
thought
that
clement
believed
the
midget
had
some
mysterious
power
and
might
be
of
service
for
him
he
was
by
no
means
certain
that
the
doctor
would
think
him
such
a
great
find
or
would
offer
to
pay
so
high
a
sum
for
him
so
he
accepted
clement
proffer
the
fiddler
poked
his
purchase
into
one
of
his
wide
pockets
turned
back
to
skansen
and
went
into
a
hut
where
there
were
neither
visitors
nor
guards
he
closed
the
door
after
him
took
out
the
midget
who
was
still
bound
hand
and
foot
and
gagged
and
laid
him
down
gently
on
a
bench
now
listen
to
what
i
say
said
clement
i
know
of
course
that
such
as
you
do
not
like
to
be
seen
of
men
but
prefer
to
go
about
and
busy
yourselves
in
your
own
way
therefore
i
have
decided
to
give
you
your
liberty
but
only
on
condition
that
you
will
remain
in
this
park
until
i
permit
you
to
leave
if
you
agree
to
this
nod
your
head
three
times
clement
gazed
at
the
midget
with
confident
expectation
but
the
latter
did
not
move
a
muscle
you
shall
not
fare
badly
continued
clement
i
see
to
it
that
you
are
fed
every
day
and
you
will
have
so
much
to
do
there
that
the
time
will
not
seem
long
to
you
but
you
must
go
elsewhere
till
i
give
you
leave
now
we
agree
as
to
a
signal
so
long
as
i
set
your
food
out
in
a
white
bowl
you
are
to
stay
when
i
set
it
out
in
a
blue
one
you
may
go
clement
paused
again
expecting
the
midget
to
give
the
sign
of
approval
but
he
did
not
stir
very
well
said
clement
then
there
no
choice
but
to
show
you
to
the
master
of
this
place
then
you
be
put
in
a
glass
case
and
all
the
people
in
the
big
city
of
stockholm
will
come
and
stare
at
you
this
scared
the
midget
and
he
promptly
gave
the
signal
that
was
right
said
clement
as
he
cut
the
cord
that
bound
the
midget
hands
then
he
hurried
toward
the
door
the
boy
unloosed
the
bands
around
his
ankles
and
tore
away
the
gag
before
thinking
of
anything
else
when
he
turned
to
clement
to
thank
him
he
had
gone
just
outside
the
door
clement
met
a
handsome
gentleman
who
was
on
his
way
to
a
place
close
by
from
which
there
was
a
beautiful
outlook
clement
could
not
recall
having
seen
the
stately
old
man
before
but
the
latter
must
surely
have
noticed
clement
sometime
when
he
was
playing
the
fiddle
because
he
stopped
and
spoke
to
him
good
day
clement
he
said
how
do
you
do
you
are
not
ill
are
you
i
think
you
have
grown
a
bit
thin
of
late
there
was
such
an
expression
of
kindliness
about
the
old
gentleman
that
clement
plucked
up
courage
and
told
him
of
his
homesickness
what
exclaimed
the
old
gentleman
are
you
homesick
when
you
are
in
stockholm
it
ca
be
possible
he
looked
almost
offended
then
he
reflected
that
it
was
only
an
ignorant
old
peasant
from
hälsingland
that
he
talked
with
and
so
resumed
his
friendly
attitude
surely
you
have
never
heard
how
the
city
of
stockholm
was
founded
if
you
had
you
would
comprehend
that
your
anxiety
to
get
away
is
only
a
foolish
fancy
come
with
me
to
the
bench
over
yonder
and
i
will
tell
you
something
about
stockholm
when
the
old
gentleman
was
seated
on
the
bench
he
glanced
down
at
the
city
which
spread
in
all
its
glory
below
him
and
he
drew
a
deep
breath
as
if
he
wished
to
drink
in
all
the
beauty
of
the
landscape
thereupon
he
turned
to
the
fiddler
look
clement
he
said
and
as
he
talked
he
traced
with
his
cane
a
little
map
in
the
sand
in
front
of
them
here
lies
uppland
and
here
to
the
south
a
point
juts
out
which
is
split
up
by
a
number
of
bays
and
here
we
have
sörmland
with
another
point
which
is
just
as
cut
up
and
points
straight
north
here
from
the
west
comes
a
lake
filled
with
islands
it
is
lake
mälar
from
the
east
comes
another
body
of
water
which
can
barely
squeeze
in
between
the
islands
and
islets
it
is
the
east
sea
here
clement
where
uppland
joins
sörmland
and
mälaren
joins
the
east
sea
comes
a
short
river
in
the
centre
of
which
lie
four
little
islets
that
divide
the
river
into
several
tributaries
one
of
which
is
called
norriström
but
was
formerly
stocksund
in
the
beginning
these
islets
were
common
wooded
islands
such
as
one
finds
in
plenty
on
lake
mälar
even
and
for
ages
they
were
entirely
uninhabited
they
were
well
located
between
two
bodies
of
water
and
two
bodies
of
land
but
this
no
one
remarked
year
after
year
passed
people
settled
along
lake
mälar
and
in
the
archipelago
but
these
river
islands
attracted
no
settlers
sometimes
it
happened
that
a
seafarer
put
into
port
at
one
of
them
and
pitched
his
tent
for
the
night
but
no
one
remained
there
long
one
day
a
fisherman
who
lived
on
liding
island
out
in
salt
fiord
steered
his
boat
toward
lake
mälar
where
he
had
such
good
luck
with
his
fishing
that
he
forgot
to
start
for
home
in
time
he
got
no
farther
than
the
four
islets
and
the
best
he
could
do
was
to
land
on
one
and
wait
until
later
in
the
night
when
there
would
be
bright
moonlight
it
was
late
summer
and
warm
the
fisherman
hauled
his
boat
on
land
lay
down
beside
it
his
head
resting
upon
a
stone
and
fell
asleep
when
he
awoke
the
moon
had
been
up
a
long
while
it
hung
right
above
him
and
shone
with
such
splendour
that
it
was
like
broad
daylight
the
man
jumped
to
his
feet
and
was
about
to
push
his
boat
into
the
water
when
he
saw
a
lot
of
black
specks
moving
out
in
the
stream
a
school
of
seals
was
heading
full
speed
for
the
island
when
the
fisherman
saw
that
they
intended
to
crawl
up
on
land
he
bent
down
for
his
spear
which
he
always
took
with
him
in
the
boat
but
when
he
straightened
up
he
saw
no
seals
instead
there
stood
on
the
strand
the
most
beautiful
young
maidens
dressed
in
green
trailing
satin
robes
with
pearl
crowns
upon
their
heads
the
fisherman
understood
that
these
were
mermaids
who
lived
on
desolate
rock
islands
far
out
at
sea
and
had
assumed
seal
disguises
in
order
to
come
up
on
land
and
enjoy
the
moonlight
on
the
green
islets
he
laid
down
the
spear
very
cautiously
and
when
the
young
maidens
came
up
on
the
island
to
play
he
stole
behind
and
surveyed
them
he
had
heard
that
were
so
beautiful
and
fascinating
that
no
one
could
see
them
and
not
be
enchanted
by
their
charms
and
he
had
to
admit
that
this
was
not
too
much
to
say
of
them
when
he
had
stood
for
a
while
under
the
shadow
of
the
trees
and
watched
the
dance
he
went
down
to
the
strand
took
one
of
the
seal
skins
lying
there
and
hid
it
under
a
stone
then
he
went
back
to
his
boat
lay
down
beside
it
and
pretended
to
be
asleep
presently
he
saw
the
young
maidens
trip
down
to
the
strand
to
don
their
seal
skins
at
first
all
was
play
and
laughter
which
was
changed
to
weeping
and
wailing
when
one
of
the
mermaids
could
not
find
her
seal
robe
her
companions
ran
up
and
down
the
strand
and
helped
her
search
for
it
but
no
trace
could
they
find
while
they
were
seeking
they
noticed
that
the
sky
was
growing
pale
and
the
day
was
breaking
so
they
could
tarry
no
longer
and
they
all
swam
away
leaving
behind
the
one
whose
seal
skin
was
missing
she
sat
on
the
strand
and
wept
the
fisherman
felt
sorry
for
her
of
course
but
he
forced
himself
to
lie
still
till
daybreak
then
he
got
up
pushed
the
boat
into
the
water
and
stepped
into
it
to
make
it
appear
that
he
saw
her
by
chance
after
he
had
lifted
the
oars
are
you
he
called
out
you
shipwrecked
she
ran
toward
him
and
asked
if
he
had
seen
her
seal
skin
the
fisherman
looked
as
if
he
did
not
know
what
she
was
talking
about
she
sat
down
again
and
wept
then
he
determined
to
take
her
with
him
in
the
boat
with
me
to
my
cottage
he
commanded
my
mother
will
take
care
of
you
you
ca
stay
here
on
the
island
where
you
have
neither
food
nor
shelter
he
talked
so
convincingly
that
she
was
persuaded
to
step
into
his
boat
both
the
fisherman
and
his
mother
were
very
kind
to
the
poor
mermaid
and
she
seemed
to
be
happy
with
them
she
grew
more
contented
every
day
and
helped
the
older
woman
with
her
work
and
was
exactly
like
any
other
island
lass
only
she
was
much
prettier
one
day
the
fisherman
asked
her
if
she
would
be
his
wife
and
she
did
not
object
but
at
once
said
yes
preparations
were
made
for
the
wedding
the
mermaid
dressed
as
a
bride
in
her
green
trailing
robe
with
the
shimmering
pearl
crown
she
had
worn
when
the
fisherman
first
saw
her
there
was
neither
church
nor
parson
on
the
island
at
that
time
so
the
bridal
party
seated
themselves
in
the
boats
to
row
up
to
the
first
church
they
should
find
the
fisherman
had
the
mermaid
and
his
mother
in
his
boat
and
he
rowed
so
well
that
he
was
far
ahead
of
all
the
others
when
he
had
come
so
far
that
he
could
see
the
islet
in
the
river
where
he
won
his
bride
he
could
not
help
smiling
are
you
smiling
at
she
asked
i
thinking
of
that
night
when
i
hid
your
seal
skin
answered
the
fisherman
for
he
felt
so
sure
of
her
that
he
thought
there
was
no
longer
any
need
for
him
to
conceal
anything
are
you
saying
asked
the
bride
astonished
i
have
never
possessed
a
seal
skin
it
appeared
she
had
forgotten
everything
you
recollect
how
you
danced
with
the
mermaids
he
asked
do
know
what
you
mean
said
the
bride
think
that
you
must
have
dreamed
a
strange
dream
last
night
if
i
show
you
your
seal
skin
you
probably
believe
me
laughed
the
fisherman
promptly
turning
the
boat
toward
the
islet
they
stepped
ashore
and
he
brought
the
seal
skin
out
from
under
the
stone
where
he
had
hidden
it
but
the
instant
the
bride
set
eyes
on
the
seal
skin
she
grasped
it
and
drew
it
over
her
head
it
snuggled
close
to
her
as
if
there
was
life
in
it
and
immediately
she
threw
herself
into
the
stream
the
bridegroom
saw
her
swim
away
and
plunged
into
the
water
after
her
but
he
could
not
catch
up
to
her
when
he
saw
that
he
could
stop
her
in
any
other
way
in
his
grief
he
seized
his
spear
and
hurled
it
he
aimed
better
than
he
had
intended
for
the
poor
mermaid
gave
a
piercing
shriek
and
disappeared
in
the
depths
the
fisherman
stood
on
the
strand
waiting
for
her
to
appear
again
he
observed
that
the
water
around
him
began
to
take
on
a
soft
sheen
a
beauty
that
he
had
never
seen
before
it
shimmered
in
pink
and
white
like
the
on
the
inside
of
sea
shells
as
the
glittering
water
lapped
the
shores
the
fisherman
thought
that
they
too
were
transformed
they
began
to
blossom
and
waft
their
perfumes
a
soft
sheen
spread
over
them
and
they
also
took
on
a
beauty
which
they
had
never
possessed
before
he
understood
how
all
this
had
come
to
pass
for
it
is
thus
with
mermaids
one
who
beholds
them
must
needs
find
them
more
beautiful
than
any
one
else
and
the
mermaid
blood
being
mixed
with
the
water
that
bathed
the
shores
her
beauty
was
transferred
to
both
all
who
saw
them
must
love
them
and
yearn
for
them
this
was
their
legacy
from
the
mermaid
when
the
stately
old
gentleman
had
got
thus
far
in
his
narrative
he
turned
to
clement
and
looked
at
him
clement
nodded
reverently
but
made
no
comment
as
he
did
not
wish
to
cause
a
break
in
the
story
now
you
must
bear
this
in
mind
clement
the
old
gentleman
continued
with
a
roguish
glint
in
his
eyes
from
that
time
on
people
emigrated
to
the
islands
at
first
only
fishermen
and
peasants
settled
there
but
others
too
were
attracted
to
them
one
day
the
king
and
his
earl
sailed
up
the
stream
they
started
at
once
to
talk
of
these
islands
having
observed
they
were
so
situated
that
every
vessel
that
sailed
toward
lake
mälar
had
to
pass
them
the
earl
suggested
that
there
ought
to
be
a
lock
put
on
the
channel
which
could
be
opened
or
closed
at
will
to
let
in
merchant
vessels
and
shut
out
pirates
this
idea
was
carried
out
said
the
old
gentleman
as
he
rose
and
began
to
trace
in
the
sand
again
with
his
cane
on
the
largest
of
these
islands
the
earl
erected
a
fortress
with
a
strong
tower
which
was
called
and
around
the
island
a
wall
was
built
here
at
the
north
and
south
ends
of
the
wall
they
made
gates
and
placed
strong
towers
over
them
across
the
other
islands
they
built
bridges
these
were
likewise
equipped
with
high
towers
out
in
the
water
round
about
they
put
a
wreath
of
piles
with
bars
that
could
open
and
close
so
that
no
vessel
could
sail
past
without
permission
therefore
you
see
clement
the
four
islands
which
had
lain
so
long
unnoticed
were
soon
strongly
fortified
but
this
was
not
all
for
the
shores
and
the
sound
tempted
people
and
before
long
they
came
from
all
quarters
to
settle
there
they
built
a
church
which
has
since
been
called
here
it
stands
near
the
castle
and
here
within
the
walls
were
the
little
huts
the
pioneers
built
for
themselves
they
were
primitive
but
they
served
their
purpose
more
was
not
needed
at
that
time
to
make
the
place
pass
for
a
city
and
the
city
was
named
stockholm
there
came
a
day
clement
when
the
earl
who
had
begun
the
work
went
to
his
final
rest
and
stockholm
was
without
a
master
builder
monks
called
the
gray
friars
came
to
the
country
stockholm
attracted
them
they
asked
permission
to
erect
a
monastery
there
so
the
king
gave
them
an
island
one
of
the
smaller
ones
this
one
facing
lake
mälar
there
they
built
and
the
place
was
called
gray
friars
island
other
monks
came
called
the
black
friars
they
too
asked
for
right
to
build
in
stockholm
near
the
south
gate
on
this
the
larger
of
the
islands
north
of
the
city
a
ghost
house
or
hospital
was
built
while
on
the
smaller
one
thrifty
men
put
up
a
mill
and
along
the
little
islands
close
by
the
monks
fished
as
you
know
there
is
only
one
island
now
for
the
canal
between
the
two
has
filled
up
but
it
is
still
called
holy
ghost
island
and
now
clement
all
the
little
wooded
islands
were
dotted
with
houses
but
still
people
kept
streaming
in
for
these
shores
and
waters
have
the
power
to
draw
people
to
them
hither
came
pious
women
of
the
order
of
saint
clara
and
asked
for
ground
to
build
upon
for
them
there
was
no
choice
but
to
settle
on
the
north
shore
at
norrmalm
as
it
is
called
you
may
be
sure
that
they
were
not
over
pleased
with
this
location
for
across
norrmalm
ran
a
high
ridge
and
on
that
the
city
had
its
gallows
hill
so
that
it
was
a
detested
spot
nevertheless
the
poor
clares
erected
their
church
and
their
convent
on
the
strand
below
the
ridge
after
they
were
established
there
they
soon
found
plenty
of
followers
upon
the
ridge
itself
were
built
a
hospital
and
a
church
consecrated
to
saint
goran
and
just
below
the
ridge
a
church
was
erected
to
saint
jacob
and
even
at
södermalm
where
the
mountain
rises
perpendicularly
from
the
strand
they
began
to
build
there
they
raised
a
church
to
saint
mary
but
you
must
not
think
that
only
cloister
folk
moved
to
stockholm
there
were
also
many
others
principally
german
tradesmen
and
artisans
these
were
more
skilled
than
the
swedes
and
were
well
received
they
settled
within
the
walls
of
the
city
where
they
pulled
down
the
wretched
little
cabins
that
stood
there
and
built
high
magnificent
stone
houses
but
space
was
not
plentiful
within
the
walls
therefore
they
had
to
build
the
houses
close
together
with
gables
facing
the
narrow
so
you
see
clement
that
stockholm
could
attract
people
at
this
point
in
the
narrative
another
gentleman
appeared
and
walked
rapidly
down
the
path
toward
the
man
who
was
talking
to
clement
but
he
waved
his
hand
and
the
other
remained
at
a
distance
the
dignified
old
gentleman
still
sat
on
the
bench
beside
the
fiddler
now
clement
you
must
render
me
a
service
he
said
i
have
no
time
to
talk
more
with
you
but
i
will
send
you
a
book
about
stockholm
and
you
must
read
it
from
cover
to
cover
i
have
so
to
speak
laid
the
foundations
of
stockholm
for
you
study
the
rest
out
for
yourself
and
learn
how
the
city
has
thrived
and
changed
read
how
the
little
narrow
city
on
the
islands
has
spread
into
this
great
sea
of
houses
below
us
read
how
on
the
spot
where
the
dark
tower
kärnan
once
stood
the
beautiful
light
castle
below
us
was
erected
and
how
the
gray
friars
church
has
been
turned
into
the
burial
place
of
the
swedish
kings
read
how
islet
after
islet
was
built
up
with
factories
how
the
ridge
was
lowered
and
the
sound
filled
in
how
the
truck
gardens
at
the
south
and
north
ends
of
the
city
have
been
converted
into
beautiful
parks
or
quarters
how
the
king
private
deer
park
has
become
the
people
favourite
pleasure
resort
you
must
make
yourself
at
home
here
clement
this
city
does
not
belong
exclusively
to
the
stockholmers
it
belongs
to
you
and
to
all
swedes
as
you
read
about
stockholm
remember
that
i
have
spoken
the
truth
for
the
city
has
the
power
to
draw
every
one
to
it
first
the
king
moved
here
then
the
nobles
built
their
palaces
here
and
then
one
after
another
was
attracted
to
the
place
so
that
now
as
you
see
stockholm
is
not
a
city
unto
itself
or
for
nearby
districts
it
has
grown
into
a
city
for
the
whole
kingdom
you
know
clement
that
there
are
judicial
courts
in
every
parish
throughout
the
land
but
in
stockholm
they
have
jurisdiction
for
the
whole
nation
you
know
that
there
are
judges
in
every
district
court
in
the
country
but
at
stockholm
there
is
only
one
court
to
which
all
the
others
are
accountable
you
know
that
there
are
barracks
and
troops
in
every
part
of
the
land
but
those
at
stockholm
command
the
whole
army
everywhere
in
the
country
you
will
find
railroads
but
the
whole
great
national
system
is
controlled
and
managed
at
stockholm
here
you
will
find
the
governing
boards
for
the
clergy
for
teachers
for
physicians
for
bailiffs
and
jurors
this
is
the
heart
of
your
country
clement
all
the
change
you
have
in
your
pocket
is
coined
here
and
the
postage
stamps
you
stick
on
your
letters
are
made
here
there
is
something
here
for
every
swede
here
no
one
need
feel
homesick
for
here
all
swedes
are
at
home
and
when
you
read
of
all
that
has
been
brought
here
to
stockholm
think
too
of
the
latest
that
the
city
has
attracted
to
itself
these
peasant
cottages
here
at
skansen
the
old
dances
the
old
costumes
and
the
musicians
and
everything
good
of
the
old
times
stockholm
has
tempted
here
to
skansen
to
do
it
honour
that
it
may
in
turn
stand
before
the
people
with
renewed
glory
but
first
and
last
remember
as
you
read
about
stockholm
that
you
are
to
sit
in
this
place
you
must
see
how
the
waves
sparkle
in
joyous
play
and
how
the
shores
shimmer
with
beauty
you
will
come
under
the
spell
of
their
witchery
clement
the
handsome
old
gentleman
had
raised
his
voice
so
that
it
rang
out
strong
and
commanding
and
his
eyes
shone
then
he
rose
and
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
to
clement
walked
away
clement
understood
that
the
one
who
had
been
talking
to
him
was
a
great
man
and
he
bowed
to
him
as
low
as
he
could
the
next
day
came
a
royal
lackey
with
a
big
red
book
and
a
letter
for
clement
and
in
the
letter
it
said
that
the
book
was
from
the
king
after
that
the
little
old
man
clement
larsson
was
lightheaded
for
several
days
and
it
was
impossible
to
get
a
sensible
word
out
of
him
when
a
week
had
gone
by
he
went
to
the
superintendent
and
gave
in
his
notice
he
simply
had
to
go
home
why
must
you
go
home
ca
you
learn
to
be
content
here
asked
the
doctor
oh
i
contented
here
said
clement
that
matter
troubles
me
no
longer
but
i
must
go
home
all
the
same
clement
was
quite
perturbed
because
the
king
had
said
that
he
should
learn
all
about
stockholm
and
be
happy
there
but
he
could
not
rest
until
he
had
told
every
one
at
home
that
the
king
had
said
those
words
to
him
he
could
not
renounce
the
idea
of
standing
on
the
church
knoll
at
home
and
telling
high
and
low
that
the
king
had
been
so
kind
to
him
that
he
had
sat
beside
him
on
the
bench
and
had
sent
him
a
book
and
had
taken
the
time
to
talk
to
him
a
poor
fiddler
for
a
whole
hour
in
order
to
cure
him
of
his
homesickness
it
was
good
to
relate
this
to
the
laplanders
and
dalecarlian
peasant
girls
at
skansen
but
what
was
that
compared
to
being
able
to
tell
of
it
at
home
even
if
clement
were
to
end
in
the
poorhouse
it
would
be
so
hard
after
this
he
was
a
totally
different
man
from
what
he
had
been
and
he
would
be
respected
and
honoured
in
a
very
different
way
this
new
yearning
took
possession
of
clement
he
simply
had
to
go
up
to
the
doctor
and
say
that
he
must
go
home
gorgo
the
eagle
in
the
mountain
glen
far
up
among
the
mountains
of
lapland
there
was
an
old
eagle
nest
on
a
ledge
which
projected
from
a
high
cliff
the
nest
was
made
of
dry
twigs
of
pine
and
spruce
interlaced
one
with
another
until
they
formed
a
perfect
network
year
by
year
the
nest
had
been
repaired
and
strengthened
it
was
about
two
metres
wide
and
nearly
as
high
as
a
laplander
hut
the
cliff
on
which
the
eagle
nest
was
situated
towered
above
a
big
glen
which
was
inhabited
in
summer
by
a
flock
of
wild
geese
as
it
was
an
excellent
refuge
for
them
it
was
so
secluded
between
cliffs
that
not
many
knew
of
it
even
among
the
laplanders
themselves
in
the
heart
of
this
glen
there
was
a
small
round
lake
in
which
was
an
abundance
of
food
for
the
tiny
goslings
and
on
the
tufted
lake
shores
which
were
covered
with
osier
bushes
and
dwarfed
birches
the
geese
found
fine
nesting
places
in
all
ages
eagles
had
lived
on
the
mountain
and
geese
in
the
glen
every
year
the
former
carried
off
a
few
of
the
latter
but
they
were
very
careful
not
to
take
so
many
that
the
wild
geese
would
be
afraid
to
remain
in
the
glen
the
geese
in
their
turn
found
the
eagles
quite
useful
they
were
robbers
to
be
sure
but
they
kept
other
robbers
away
two
years
before
nils
holgersson
travelled
with
the
wild
geese
the
old
akka
from
kebnekaise
was
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
slope
looking
toward
the
eagle
nest
the
eagles
were
in
the
habit
of
starting
on
their
chase
soon
after
sunrise
during
the
summers
that
akka
had
lived
in
the
glen
she
had
watched
every
morning
for
their
departure
to
find
if
they
stopped
in
the
glen
to
hunt
or
if
they
flew
beyond
it
to
other
hunting
grounds
she
did
not
have
to
wait
long
before
the
two
eagles
left
the
ledge
on
the
cliff
stately
and
they
soared
into
the
air
they
directed
their
course
toward
the
plain
and
akka
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
the
old
days
of
nesting
and
rearing
of
young
were
over
and
during
the
summer
she
passed
the
time
going
from
one
goose
range
to
another
giving
counsel
regarding
the
brooding
and
care
of
the
young
aside
from
this
she
kept
an
eye
out
not
only
for
eagles
but
also
for
mountain
fox
and
owls
and
all
other
enemies
who
were
a
menace
to
the
wild
geese
and
their
young
about
noontime
akka
began
to
watch
for
the
eagles
again
this
she
had
done
every
day
during
all
the
summers
that
she
had
lived
in
the
glen
she
could
tell
at
once
by
their
flight
if
their
hunt
had
been
successful
and
in
that
event
she
felt
relieved
for
the
safety
of
those
who
belonged
to
her
but
on
this
particular
day
she
had
not
seen
the
eagles
return
i
must
be
getting
old
and
stupid
she
thought
when
she
had
waited
a
time
for
them
the
eagles
have
probably
been
home
this
long
while
in
the
afternoon
she
looked
toward
the
cliff
again
expecting
to
see
the
eagles
perched
on
the
rocky
ledge
where
they
usually
took
their
afternoon
rest
toward
evening
when
they
took
their
bath
in
the
dale
lake
she
tried
again
to
get
sight
of
them
but
failed
again
she
bemoaned
the
fact
that
she
was
growing
old
she
was
so
accustomed
to
having
the
eagles
on
the
mountain
above
her
that
she
could
not
imagine
the
possibility
of
their
not
having
returned
the
following
morning
akka
was
awake
in
good
season
to
watch
for
the
eagles
but
she
did
not
see
them
on
the
other
hand
she
heard
in
the
morning
stillness
a
cry
that
sounded
both
angry
and
plaintive
and
it
seemed
to
come
from
the
eagles
nest
can
there
possibly
be
anything
amiss
with
the
eagles
she
wondered
she
spread
her
wings
quickly
and
rose
so
high
that
she
could
perfectly
well
look
down
into
the
nest
there
she
saw
neither
of
the
eagles
there
was
no
one
in
the
nest
save
a
little
eaglet
who
was
screaming
for
food
akka
sank
down
toward
the
eagles
nest
slowly
and
reluctantly
it
was
a
gruesome
place
to
come
to
it
was
plain
what
kind
of
robber
folk
lived
there
in
the
nest
and
on
the
cliff
ledge
lay
bleached
bones
bloody
feathers
pieces
of
skin
hares
heads
birds
beaks
and
the
tufted
claws
of
grouse
the
eaglet
who
was
lying
in
the
midst
of
this
was
repulsive
to
look
upon
with
his
big
gaping
bill
his
awkward
body
and
his
undeveloped
wings
where
the
prospective
quills
stuck
out
like
thorns
at
last
akka
conquered
her
repugnance
and
alighted
on
the
edge
of
the
nest
at
the
same
time
glancing
about
her
anxiously
in
every
direction
for
each
second
she
expected
to
see
the
old
eagles
coming
back
it
is
well
that
some
one
has
come
at
last
cried
the
baby
eagle
fetch
me
some
food
at
once
well
well
do
be
in
such
haste
said
akka
tell
me
first
where
your
father
and
mother
are
that
what
i
should
like
to
know
myself
they
went
off
yesterday
morning
and
left
me
a
lemming
to
live
upon
while
they
were
away
you
can
believe
that
was
eaten
long
ago
it
a
shame
for
mother
to
let
me
starve
in
this
way
akka
began
to
think
that
the
eagles
had
really
been
shot
and
she
reasoned
that
if
she
were
to
let
the
eaglet
starve
she
might
perhaps
be
rid
of
the
whole
robber
tribe
for
all
time
but
it
went
very
much
against
her
not
to
succour
a
deserted
young
one
so
far
as
she
could
why
do
you
sit
there
and
stare
snapped
the
eaglet
did
you
hear
me
say
i
want
food
akka
spread
her
wings
and
sank
down
to
the
little
lake
in
the
glen
a
moment
later
she
returned
to
the
eagles
nest
with
a
salmon
trout
in
her
bill
the
eaglet
flew
into
a
temper
when
she
dropped
the
fish
in
front
of
him
do
you
think
i
can
eat
such
stuff
he
shrieked
pushing
it
aside
and
trying
to
strike
akka
with
his
bill
fetch
me
a
willow
grouse
or
a
lemming
do
you
hear
akka
stretched
her
head
forward
and
gave
the
eaglet
a
sharp
nip
in
the
neck
let
me
say
to
you
remarked
the
old
goose
that
if
i
to
procure
food
for
you
you
must
be
satisfied
with
what
i
give
you
your
father
and
mother
are
dead
and
from
them
you
can
get
no
help
but
if
you
want
to
lie
here
and
starve
to
death
while
you
wait
for
grouse
and
lemming
i
shall
not
hinder
you
when
akka
had
spoken
her
mind
she
promptly
retired
and
did
not
show
her
face
in
the
eagles
nest
again
for
some
time
but
when
she
did
return
the
eaglet
had
eaten
the
fish
and
when
she
dropped
another
in
front
of
him
he
swallowed
it
at
once
although
it
was
plain
that
he
found
it
very
distasteful
akka
had
imposed
upon
herself
a
tedious
task
the
old
eagles
never
appeared
again
and
she
alone
had
to
procure
for
the
eaglet
all
the
food
he
needed
she
gave
him
fish
and
frogs
and
he
did
not
seem
to
fare
badly
on
this
diet
but
grew
big
and
strong
he
soon
forgot
his
parents
the
eagles
and
fancied
that
akka
was
his
real
mother
akka
in
turn
loved
him
as
if
he
had
been
her
own
child
she
tried
to
give
him
a
good
bringing
up
and
to
cure
him
of
his
wildness
and
overbearing
ways
after
a
fortnight
akka
observed
that
the
time
was
approaching
for
her
to
moult
and
put
on
a
new
feather
dress
so
as
to
be
ready
to
fly
for
a
whole
moon
she
would
be
unable
to
carry
food
to
the
baby
eaglet
and
he
might
starve
to
death
so
akka
said
to
him
one
day
gorgo
i
ca
come
to
you
any
more
with
fish
everything
depends
now
upon
your
pluck
which
means
can
you
dare
to
venture
into
the
glen
so
i
can
continue
to
procure
food
for
you
you
must
choose
between
starvation
and
flying
down
to
the
glen
but
that
too
may
cost
you
your
life
without
a
second
hesitation
the
eaglet
stepped
upon
the
edge
of
the
nest
barely
taking
the
trouble
to
measure
the
distance
to
the
bottom
he
spread
his
tiny
wings
and
started
away
he
rolled
over
and
over
in
space
but
nevertheless
made
enough
use
of
his
wings
to
reach
the
ground
almost
unhurt
down
there
in
the
glen
gorgo
passed
the
summer
in
company
with
the
little
goslings
and
was
a
good
comrade
for
them
since
he
regarded
himself
as
a
gosling
he
tried
to
live
as
they
lived
when
they
swam
in
the
lake
he
followed
them
until
he
came
near
drowning
it
was
most
embarrassing
to
him
that
he
could
not
learn
to
swim
and
he
went
to
akka
and
complained
of
his
inability
why
ca
i
swim
like
the
others
he
asked
your
claws
grew
too
hooked
and
your
toes
too
large
while
you
were
up
there
on
the
cliff
akka
replied
but
you
make
a
fine
bird
all
the
same
the
eaglet
wings
soon
grew
so
large
that
they
could
carry
him
but
not
until
autumn
when
the
goslings
learned
to
fly
did
it
dawn
upon
him
that
he
could
use
them
for
flight
there
came
a
proud
time
for
him
for
at
this
sport
he
was
the
peer
of
them
all
his
companions
never
stayed
up
in
the
air
any
longer
than
they
had
to
but
he
stayed
there
nearly
the
whole
day
and
practised
the
art
of
flying
so
far
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
of
another
species
than
the
geese
but
he
could
not
help
noting
a
number
of
things
that
surprised
him
and
he
questioned
akka
constantly
why
do
grouse
and
lemming
run
and
hide
when
they
see
my
shadow
on
the
cliff
he
queried
they
do
show
such
fear
of
the
other
goslings
your
wings
grew
too
big
when
you
were
on
the
cliff
said
akka
it
is
that
which
frightens
the
little
wretches
but
do
be
unhappy
because
of
that
you
be
a
fine
bird
all
the
same
after
the
eagle
had
learned
to
fly
he
taught
himself
to
fish
and
to
catch
frogs
but
by
and
by
he
began
to
ponder
this
also
how
does
it
happen
that
i
live
on
fish
and
frogs
he
asked
the
other
goslings
do
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
i
had
no
other
food
to
give
you
when
you
were
on
the
cliff
said
akka
but
do
let
that
make
you
sad
be
a
fine
bird
all
the
same
when
the
wild
geese
began
their
autumn
moving
gorgo
flew
along
with
the
flock
regarding
himself
all
the
while
as
one
of
them
the
air
was
filled
with
birds
who
were
on
their
way
south
and
there
was
great
excitement
among
them
when
akka
appeared
with
an
eagle
in
her
train
the
wild
goose
flock
was
continually
surrounded
by
swarms
of
the
curious
who
loudly
expressed
their
astonishment
akka
bade
them
be
silent
but
it
was
impossible
to
stop
so
many
wagging
tongues
why
do
they
call
me
an
eagle
gorgo
asked
repeatedly
growing
more
and
more
exasperated
ca
they
see
that
i
a
wild
goose
i
no
who
preys
upon
his
kind
how
dare
they
give
me
such
an
ugly
name
one
day
they
flew
above
a
barn
yard
where
many
chickens
walked
on
a
dump
heap
and
picked
an
eagle
an
eagle
shrieked
the
chickens
and
started
to
run
for
shelter
but
gorgo
who
had
heard
the
eagles
spoken
of
as
savage
criminals
could
not
control
his
anger
he
snapped
his
wings
together
and
shot
down
to
the
ground
striking
his
talons
into
one
of
the
hens
i
teach
you
i
will
that
i
no
eagle
he
screamed
furiously
and
struck
with
his
beak
that
instant
he
heard
akka
call
to
him
from
the
air
and
rose
obediently
the
wild
goose
flew
toward
him
and
began
to
reprimand
him
what
are
you
trying
to
do
she
cried
beating
him
with
her
bill
was
it
perhaps
your
intention
to
tear
that
poor
hen
to
pieces
but
when
the
eagle
took
his
punishment
from
the
wild
goose
without
a
protest
there
arose
from
the
great
bird
throng
around
them
a
perfect
storm
of
taunts
and
gibes
the
eagle
heard
this
and
turned
toward
akka
with
flaming
eyes
as
though
he
would
have
liked
to
attack
her
but
he
suddenly
changed
his
mind
and
with
quick
wing
strokes
bounded
into
the
air
soaring
so
high
that
no
call
could
reach
him
and
he
sailed
around
up
there
as
long
as
the
wild
geese
saw
him
two
days
later
he
appeared
again
in
the
wild
goose
flock
i
know
who
i
am
he
said
to
akka
since
i
am
an
eagle
i
must
live
as
becomes
an
eagle
but
i
think
that
we
can
be
friends
all
the
same
you
or
any
of
yours
i
shall
never
attack
but
akka
had
set
her
heart
on
successfully
training
an
eagle
into
a
mild
and
harmless
bird
and
she
could
not
tolerate
his
wanting
to
do
as
he
chose
do
you
think
that
i
wish
to
be
the
friend
of
a
she
asked
live
as
i
have
taught
you
to
live
and
you
may
travel
with
my
flock
as
heretofore
both
were
proud
and
stubborn
and
neither
of
them
would
yield
it
ended
in
akka
forbidding
the
eagle
to
show
his
face
in
her
neighbourhood
and
her
anger
toward
him
was
so
intense
that
no
one
dared
speak
his
name
in
her
presence
after
that
gorgo
roamed
around
the
country
alone
and
shunned
like
all
great
robbers
he
was
often
downhearted
and
certainly
longed
many
a
time
for
the
days
when
he
thought
himself
a
wild
goose
and
played
with
the
merry
goslings
among
the
animals
he
had
a
great
reputation
for
courage
they
used
to
say
of
him
that
he
feared
no
one
but
his
akka
and
they
could
also
say
of
him
that
he
never
used
violence
against
a
wild
goose
in
captivity
gorgo
was
only
three
years
old
and
had
not
as
yet
thought
about
marrying
and
procuring
a
home
for
himself
when
he
was
captured
one
day
by
a
hunter
and
sold
to
the
skansen
zoölogical
garden
where
there
were
already
two
eagles
held
captive
in
a
cage
built
of
iron
bars
and
steel
wires
the
cage
stood
out
in
the
open
and
was
so
large
that
a
couple
of
trees
had
easily
been
moved
into
it
and
quite
a
large
cairn
was
piled
up
in
there
notwithstanding
all
this
the
birds
were
unhappy
they
sat
motionless
on
the
same
spot
nearly
all
day
their
pretty
dark
feather
dresses
became
rough
and
lustreless
and
their
eyes
were
riveted
with
hopeless
longing
on
the
sky
without
during
the
first
week
of
gorgo
captivity
he
was
still
awake
and
full
of
life
but
later
a
heavy
torpor
came
upon
him
he
perched
himself
on
one
spot
like
the
other
eagles
and
stared
at
vacancy
he
no
longer
knew
how
the
days
passed
one
morning
when
gorgo
sat
in
his
usual
torpor
he
heard
some
one
call
to
him
from
below
he
was
so
drowsy
that
he
could
barely
rouse
himself
enough
to
lower
his
glance
who
is
calling
me
he
asked
oh
gorgo
do
you
know
me
it
thumbietot
who
used
to
fly
around
with
the
wild
geese
is
akka
also
captured
asked
gorgo
in
the
tone
of
one
who
is
trying
to
collect
his
thoughts
after
a
long
sleep
no
akka
the
white
and
the
whole
flock
are
probably
safe
and
sound
up
in
lapland
at
this
season
said
the
boy
it
only
i
who
am
a
prisoner
here
as
the
boy
was
speaking
he
noticed
that
gorgo
averted
his
glance
and
began
to
stare
into
space
again
golden
eagle
cried
the
boy
i
have
not
forgotten
that
once
you
carried
me
back
to
the
wild
geese
and
that
you
spared
the
white
life
tell
me
if
i
can
be
of
any
help
to
you
gorgo
scarcely
raised
his
head
do
disturb
me
thumbietot
he
yawned
i
sitting
here
dreaming
that
i
am
free
and
am
soaring
away
up
among
the
clouds
i
do
want
to
be
awake
you
must
rouse
yourself
and
see
what
goes
on
around
you
the
boy
admonished
or
you
will
soon
look
as
wretched
as
the
other
eagles
i
wish
i
were
as
they
are
they
are
so
lost
in
their
dreams
that
nothing
more
can
trouble
them
said
the
eagle
when
night
came
and
all
three
eagles
were
asleep
there
was
a
light
scraping
on
the
steel
wires
stretched
across
the
top
of
the
cage
the
two
listless
old
captives
did
not
allow
themselves
to
be
disturbed
by
the
noise
but
gorgo
awakened
who
there
who
is
moving
up
on
the
roof
he
asked
it
thumbietot
gorgo
answered
the
boy
i
sitting
here
filing
away
at
the
steel
wires
so
that
you
can
escape
the
eagle
raised
his
head
and
saw
in
the
night
light
how
the
boy
sat
and
filed
the
steel
wires
at
the
top
of
the
cage
he
felt
hopeful
for
an
instant
but
soon
discouragement
got
the
upper
hand
i
a
big
bird
thumbietot
said
gorgo
how
can
you
ever
manage
to
file
away
enough
wires
for
me
to
come
out
you
better
quit
that
and
leave
me
in
peace
oh
go
to
sleep
and
do
bother
about
me
said
the
boy
i
not
be
through
nor
night
but
i
shall
try
to
free
you
in
time
for
here
you
become
a
total
wreck
gorgo
fell
asleep
when
he
awoke
the
next
morning
he
saw
at
a
glance
that
a
number
of
wires
had
been
filed
that
day
he
felt
less
drowsy
than
he
had
done
in
the
past
he
spread
his
wings
and
fluttered
from
branch
to
branch
to
get
the
stiffness
out
of
his
joints
one
morning
early
just
as
the
first
streak
of
sunlight
made
its
appearance
thumbietot
awakened
the
eagle
try
now
gorgo
he
whispered
the
eagle
looked
up
the
boy
had
actually
filed
off
so
many
wires
that
now
there
was
a
big
hole
in
the
wire
netting
gorgo
flapped
his
wings
and
propelled
himself
upward
twice
he
missed
and
fell
back
into
the
cage
but
finally
he
succeeded
in
getting
out
with
proud
wing
strokes
he
soared
into
the
clouds
little
thumbietot
sat
and
gazed
after
him
with
a
mournful
expression
he
wished
that
some
one
would
come
and
give
him
his
freedom
too
the
boy
was
domiciled
now
at
skansen
he
had
become
acquainted
with
all
the
animals
there
and
had
made
many
friends
among
them
he
had
to
admit
that
there
was
so
much
to
see
and
learn
there
that
it
was
not
difficult
for
him
to
pass
the
time
to
be
sure
his
thoughts
went
forth
every
day
to
morten
and
his
other
comrades
and
he
yearned
for
them
if
only
i
were
bound
by
my
promise
he
thought
i
find
some
bird
to
take
me
to
them
it
may
seem
strange
that
clement
larsson
had
not
restored
the
liberty
but
one
must
remember
how
excited
the
little
fiddler
had
been
when
he
left
skansen
the
morning
of
his
departure
he
had
thought
of
setting
out
the
midget
food
in
a
blue
bowl
but
unluckily
he
had
been
unable
to
find
one
all
the
skansen
folk
lapps
peasant
girls
artisans
and
gardeners
had
come
to
bid
him
and
he
had
had
no
time
to
search
for
a
blue
bowl
it
was
time
to
start
and
at
the
last
moment
he
had
to
ask
the
old
laplander
to
help
him
one
of
the
tiny
folk
happens
to
be
living
here
at
skansen
said
clement
and
every
morning
i
set
out
a
little
food
for
him
will
you
do
me
the
favour
of
taking
these
few
coppers
and
purchasing
a
blue
bowl
with
them
put
a
little
gruel
and
milk
in
it
and
morning
set
it
out
under
the
steps
of
bollnäs
cottage
the
old
laplander
looked
surprised
but
there
was
no
time
for
clement
to
explain
further
as
he
had
to
be
off
to
the
railway
station
the
laplander
went
down
to
the
zoölogical
village
to
purchase
the
bowl
as
he
saw
no
blue
one
that
he
thought
appropriate
he
bought
a
white
one
and
this
he
conscientiously
filled
and
set
out
every
morning
that
was
why
the
boy
had
not
been
released
from
his
pledge
he
knew
that
clement
had
gone
away
but
was
not
allowed
to
leave
that
night
the
boy
longed
more
than
ever
for
his
freedom
this
was
because
summer
had
come
now
in
earnest
during
his
travels
he
had
suffered
much
in
cold
and
stormy
weather
and
when
he
first
came
to
skansen
he
had
thought
that
perhaps
it
was
just
as
well
that
he
had
been
compelled
to
break
the
journey
he
would
have
been
frozen
to
death
had
he
gone
to
lapland
in
the
month
of
may
but
now
it
was
warm
the
earth
was
birches
and
poplars
were
clothed
in
their
satiny
foliage
and
the
cherry
trees
in
fact
all
the
fruit
trees
were
covered
with
blossoms
the
berry
bushes
had
green
berries
on
their
stems
the
oaks
had
carefully
unfolded
their
leaves
and
peas
cabbages
and
beans
were
growing
in
the
vegetable
garden
at
skansen
now
it
must
be
warm
up
in
lapland
thought
the
boy
i
should
like
to
be
seated
on
morten
back
on
a
fine
morning
like
this
it
would
be
great
fun
to
ride
around
in
the
warm
still
air
and
look
down
at
the
ground
as
it
now
lies
decked
with
green
grass
and
embellished
with
pretty
blossoms
he
sat
musing
on
this
when
the
eagle
suddenly
swooped
down
from
the
sky
and
perched
beside
the
boy
on
top
of
the
cage
i
wanted
to
try
my
wings
to
see
if
they
were
still
good
for
anything
said
gorgo
you
did
suppose
that
i
meant
to
leave
you
here
in
captivity
get
up
on
my
back
and
i
take
you
to
your
comrades
no
that
impossible
the
boy
answered
i
have
pledged
my
word
that
i
would
stay
here
till
i
am
liberated
what
sort
of
nonsense
are
you
talking
protested
gorgo
in
the
first
place
they
brought
you
here
against
your
will
then
they
forced
you
to
promise
that
you
would
remain
here
surely
you
must
understand
that
such
a
promise
one
need
not
keep
oh
no
i
must
keep
it
said
the
boy
i
thank
you
all
the
same
for
your
kind
intention
but
you
ca
help
me
oh
ca
i
said
gorgo
we
see
about
that
in
a
twinkling
he
grasped
nils
holgersson
in
his
big
talons
and
rose
with
him
toward
the
skies
disappearing
in
a
northerly
direction
on
over
gästrikland
the
precious
girdle
june
the
eagle
kept
on
flying
until
he
was
a
long
distance
north
of
stockholm
then
he
sank
to
a
wooded
hillock
where
he
relaxed
his
hold
on
the
boy
the
instant
thumbietot
was
out
of
gorgo
clutches
he
started
to
run
back
to
the
city
as
fast
as
he
could
the
eagle
made
a
long
swoop
caught
up
to
the
boy
and
stopped
him
with
his
claw
do
you
propose
to
go
back
to
prison
he
demanded
that
my
affair
i
can
go
where
i
like
for
all
of
you
retorted
the
boy
trying
to
get
away
thereupon
the
eagle
gripped
him
with
his
strong
talons
and
rose
in
the
air
now
gorgo
circled
over
the
entire
province
of
uppland
and
did
not
stop
again
until
he
came
to
the
great
at
älvkarleby
where
he
alighted
on
a
rock
in
the
middle
of
the
rushing
rapids
below
the
roaring
falls
again
he
relaxed
his
hold
on
the
captive
the
boy
saw
that
here
there
was
no
chance
of
escape
from
the
eagle
above
them
the
white
scum
wall
of
the
came
tumbling
down
and
round
about
the
river
rushed
along
in
a
mighty
torrent
thumbietot
was
very
indignant
to
think
that
in
this
way
he
had
been
forced
to
become
a
he
turned
his
back
to
the
eagle
and
would
not
speak
to
him
now
that
the
bird
had
set
the
boy
down
in
a
place
from
which
he
could
not
run
away
he
told
him
confidentially
that
he
had
been
brought
up
by
akka
from
kebnekaise
and
that
he
had
quarrelled
with
his
now
thumbietot
perhaps
you
understand
why
i
wish
to
take
you
back
to
the
wild
geese
he
said
i
have
heard
that
you
are
in
great
favour
with
akka
and
it
was
my
purpose
to
ask
you
to
make
peace
between
us
as
soon
as
the
boy
comprehended
that
the
eagle
had
not
carried
him
off
in
a
spirit
of
contrariness
he
felt
kindly
toward
him
i
should
like
very
much
to
help
you
he
returned
but
i
am
bound
by
my
promise
thereupon
he
explained
to
the
eagle
how
he
had
fallen
into
captivity
and
how
clement
larsson
had
left
skansen
without
setting
him
free
nevertheless
the
eagle
would
not
relinquish
his
plan
listen
to
me
thumbietot
he
said
my
wings
can
carry
you
wherever
you
wish
to
go
and
my
eyes
can
search
out
whatever
you
wish
to
find
tell
me
how
the
man
looks
who
exacted
this
promise
from
you
and
i
will
find
him
and
take
you
to
him
then
it
is
for
you
to
do
the
rest
thumbietot
approved
of
the
proposition
i
can
see
gorgo
that
you
have
had
a
wise
bird
like
akka
for
a
the
boy
remarked
he
gave
a
graphic
description
of
clement
larsson
and
added
that
he
had
heard
at
skansen
that
the
little
fiddler
was
from
hälsingland
we
search
for
him
through
the
whole
of
hälsingland
from
ljungby
to
mellansjö
from
great
mountain
to
hornland
said
the
eagle
before
sundown
you
shall
have
a
talk
with
the
man
i
fear
you
are
promising
more
than
you
can
perform
doubted
the
boy
i
should
be
a
mighty
poor
eagle
if
i
could
do
that
much
said
gorgo
so
when
gorgo
and
thumbietot
left
älvkarleby
they
were
good
friends
and
the
boy
willingly
took
his
mount
for
a
ride
on
the
eagle
back
thus
he
had
an
opportunity
to
see
much
of
the
country
when
clutched
in
the
eagle
talons
he
had
seen
nothing
perhaps
it
was
just
as
well
for
in
the
forenoon
he
had
travelled
over
upsala
österby
big
factories
the
dannemora
mine
and
the
ancient
castle
of
örbyhus
and
he
would
have
been
sadly
disappointed
at
not
seeing
them
had
he
known
of
their
proximity
the
eagle
bore
him
speedily
over
gästrikland
in
the
southern
part
of
the
province
there
was
very
little
to
tempt
the
eye
but
as
they
flew
northward
it
began
to
be
interesting
this
country
is
clad
in
a
spruce
skirt
and
a
jacket
thought
the
boy
but
around
its
waist
it
wears
a
girdle
which
has
not
its
match
in
value
for
it
is
embroidered
with
blue
lakes
and
green
groves
the
great
ironworks
adorn
it
like
a
row
of
precious
stones
and
its
buckle
is
a
whole
city
with
castles
and
cathedrals
and
great
clusters
of
houses
when
the
travellers
arrived
in
the
northern
forest
region
gorgo
alighted
on
top
of
a
mountain
as
the
boy
dismounted
the
eagle
said
there
game
in
this
forest
and
i
ca
forget
my
late
captivity
and
feel
really
free
until
i
have
gone
you
wo
mind
my
leaving
you
for
a
while
no
of
course
i
wo
the
boy
assured
him
you
may
go
where
you
like
if
only
you
are
back
here
by
sundown
said
the
eagle
as
he
flew
off
the
boy
sat
on
a
stone
gazing
across
the
bare
rocky
ground
and
the
great
forests
round
about
he
felt
rather
lonely
but
soon
he
heard
singing
in
the
forest
below
and
saw
something
bright
moving
amongst
the
trees
presently
he
saw
a
blue
and
yellow
banner
and
he
knew
by
the
songs
and
the
merry
chatter
that
it
was
being
borne
at
the
head
of
a
procession
on
it
came
up
the
winding
path
he
wondered
where
it
and
those
who
followed
it
were
going
he
could
believe
that
anybody
would
come
up
to
such
an
ugly
desolate
waste
as
the
place
where
he
sat
but
the
banner
was
nearing
the
forest
border
and
behind
it
marched
many
happy
people
for
whom
it
had
led
the
way
suddenly
there
was
life
and
movement
all
over
the
mountain
plain
after
that
there
was
so
much
for
the
boy
to
see
that
he
did
have
a
dull
moment
forest
day
on
the
mountain
broad
back
where
gorgo
left
thumbietot
there
had
been
a
forest
fire
ten
years
before
since
that
time
the
charred
trees
had
been
felled
and
removed
and
the
great
area
had
begun
to
deck
itself
with
green
along
the
edges
where
it
skirted
the
healthy
forest
however
the
larger
part
of
the
top
was
still
barren
and
appallingly
desolate
charred
stumps
standing
between
the
rock
ledges
bore
witness
that
once
there
had
been
a
fine
forest
here
but
no
fresh
roots
sprang
from
the
ground
one
day
in
the
early
summer
all
the
children
in
the
parish
had
assembled
in
front
of
the
schoolhouse
near
the
mountain
each
child
carried
either
a
spade
or
a
hoe
on
its
shoulder
and
a
basket
of
food
in
its
hand
as
soon
as
all
were
assembled
they
marched
in
a
long
procession
toward
the
forest
the
banner
came
first
with
the
teachers
on
either
side
of
it
then
followed
a
couple
of
foresters
and
a
wagon
load
of
pine
shrubs
and
spruce
seeds
then
the
children
the
procession
did
not
pause
in
any
of
the
birch
groves
near
the
settlements
but
marched
on
deep
into
the
forest
as
it
moved
along
the
foxes
stuck
their
heads
out
of
the
lairs
in
astonishment
and
wondered
what
kind
of
backwoods
people
these
were
as
they
marched
past
old
coal
pits
where
charcoal
kilns
were
fired
every
autumn
the
twisted
their
hooked
bills
and
asked
one
another
what
kind
of
coalers
these
might
be
who
were
now
thronging
the
forest
finally
the
procession
reached
the
big
burnt
mountain
plain
the
rocks
had
been
stripped
of
the
fine
creepers
that
once
covered
them
they
had
been
robbed
of
the
pretty
silver
moss
and
the
attractive
reindeer
moss
around
the
dark
water
gathered
in
clefts
and
hollows
there
was
now
no
the
little
patches
of
soil
in
crevices
and
between
stones
were
without
ferns
without
without
all
the
green
and
red
and
light
and
soft
and
soothing
things
which
usually
clothe
the
forest
ground
it
was
as
if
a
bright
light
flashed
upon
the
mountain
when
all
the
parish
children
covered
it
here
again
was
something
sweet
and
delicate
something
fresh
and
rosy
something
young
and
growing
perhaps
these
children
would
bring
to
the
poor
abandoned
forest
a
little
new
life
when
the
children
had
rested
and
eaten
their
luncheon
they
seized
hoes
and
spades
and
began
to
work
the
foresters
showed
them
what
to
do
they
set
out
shrub
after
shrub
on
every
clear
spot
of
earth
they
could
find
as
they
worked
they
talked
quite
knowingly
among
themselves
of
how
the
little
shrubs
they
were
planting
would
bind
the
soil
so
that
it
could
not
get
away
and
of
how
new
soil
would
form
under
the
trees
by
and
by
seeds
would
drop
and
in
a
few
years
they
would
be
picking
both
strawberries
and
raspberries
where
now
there
were
only
bare
rocks
the
little
shrubs
which
they
were
planting
would
gradually
become
tall
trees
perhaps
big
houses
and
great
splendid
ships
would
be
built
from
them
if
the
children
had
not
come
here
and
planted
while
there
was
still
a
little
soil
in
the
clefts
all
the
earth
would
have
been
carried
away
by
wind
and
water
and
the
mountain
could
never
more
have
been
clothed
in
green
it
was
well
that
we
came
said
the
children
we
were
just
in
the
nick
of
time
they
felt
very
important
while
they
were
working
on
the
mountain
their
parents
were
at
home
by
and
by
they
began
to
wonder
how
the
children
were
getting
along
of
course
it
was
only
a
joke
about
their
planting
a
forest
but
it
might
be
amusing
to
see
what
they
were
trying
to
do
so
presently
both
fathers
and
mothers
were
on
their
way
to
the
forest
when
they
came
to
the
outlying
stock
farms
they
met
some
of
their
neighbours
are
you
going
to
the
mountain
they
asked
that
where
we
bound
for
to
have
a
look
at
the
children
yes
to
see
what
they
up
to
it
only
play
of
course
it
is
likely
that
there
will
be
many
forest
trees
planted
by
the
youngsters
we
have
brought
the
coffee
pot
along
so
that
we
can
have
something
warm
to
drink
since
we
must
stay
there
all
day
with
only
provisions
so
the
parents
of
the
children
went
on
up
the
mountain
at
first
they
thought
only
of
how
pretty
it
looked
to
see
all
the
little
children
scattered
over
the
gray
hills
later
they
observed
how
the
children
were
working
how
some
were
setting
out
shrubs
while
others
were
digging
furrows
and
sowing
seeds
others
again
were
pulling
up
heather
to
prevent
its
choking
the
young
trees
they
saw
that
the
children
took
the
work
seriously
and
were
so
intent
upon
what
they
were
doing
that
they
scarcely
had
time
to
glance
up
the
fathers
and
mothers
stood
for
a
moment
and
looked
on
then
they
too
began
to
pull
up
heather
just
for
the
fun
of
it
the
children
were
the
instructors
for
they
were
already
trained
and
had
to
show
their
elders
what
to
do
thus
it
happened
that
all
the
who
had
come
to
watch
the
children
took
part
in
the
work
then
of
course
it
became
greater
fun
than
before
by
and
by
the
children
had
even
more
help
other
implements
were
needed
so
a
couple
of
boys
were
sent
down
to
the
village
for
spades
and
hoes
as
they
ran
past
the
cabins
the
came
out
and
asked
what
wrong
has
there
been
an
accident
no
indeed
but
the
whole
parish
is
up
on
the
mountain
planting
a
forest
if
the
whole
parish
is
there
we
ca
stay
at
home
so
party
after
party
of
peasants
went
crowding
to
the
top
of
the
burnt
mountain
they
stood
a
moment
and
looked
on
the
temptation
to
join
the
workers
was
irresistible
it
a
pleasure
to
sow
one
own
acres
in
the
spring
and
to
think
of
the
grain
that
will
spring
up
from
the
earth
but
this
work
is
even
more
alluring
they
thought
not
only
slender
blades
would
come
from
that
sowing
but
mighty
trees
with
tall
trunks
and
sturdy
branches
it
meant
giving
birth
not
merely
to
a
summer
grain
but
to
many
years
growths
it
meant
the
awakening
hum
of
insects
the
song
of
the
thrush
the
play
of
grouse
and
all
kinds
of
life
on
the
desolate
mountain
moreover
it
was
like
raising
a
memorial
for
coming
generations
they
could
have
left
a
bare
treeless
height
as
a
heritage
instead
they
were
to
leave
a
glorious
forest
coming
generations
would
know
their
forefathers
had
been
a
good
and
wise
folk
and
they
would
remember
them
with
reverence
and
gratitude
a
day
in
hälsingland
a
large
green
leaf
june
the
following
day
the
boy
travelled
over
hälsingland
it
spread
beneath
him
with
new
shoots
on
the
pine
trees
new
birch
leaves
in
the
groves
new
green
grass
in
the
meadows
and
sprouting
grain
in
the
fields
it
was
a
mountainous
country
but
directly
through
it
ran
a
broad
light
valley
from
either
side
of
which
branched
other
valleys
some
short
and
narrow
some
broad
and
long
this
land
resembles
a
leaf
thought
the
boy
for
it
as
green
as
a
leaf
and
the
valleys
subdivide
it
in
about
the
same
way
as
the
veins
of
a
leaf
are
foliated
the
branch
valleys
like
the
main
one
were
filled
with
lakes
rivers
farms
and
villages
they
snuggled
light
and
smiling
between
the
dark
mountains
until
they
were
gradually
squeezed
together
by
the
hills
there
they
were
so
narrow
that
they
could
not
hold
more
than
a
little
brook
on
the
high
land
between
the
valleys
there
were
pine
forests
which
had
no
even
ground
to
grow
upon
there
were
mountains
standing
all
about
and
the
forest
covered
the
whole
like
a
woolly
hide
stretched
over
a
bony
body
it
was
a
picturesque
country
to
look
down
upon
and
the
boy
saw
a
good
deal
of
it
because
the
eagle
was
trying
to
find
the
old
fiddler
clement
larsson
and
flew
from
ravine
to
ravine
looking
for
him
a
little
later
in
the
morning
there
was
life
and
movement
on
every
farm
the
doors
of
the
cattle
sheds
were
thrown
wide
open
and
the
cows
were
let
out
they
were
prettily
coloured
small
supple
and
sprightly
and
so
that
they
made
the
most
comic
leaps
and
bounds
after
them
came
the
calves
and
sheep
and
it
was
plainly
to
be
seen
that
they
too
were
in
the
best
of
spirits
it
grew
livelier
every
moment
in
the
farm
yards
a
couple
of
young
girls
with
knapsacks
on
their
backs
walked
among
the
cattle
a
boy
with
a
long
switch
kept
the
sheep
together
and
a
little
dog
ran
in
and
out
among
the
cows
barking
at
the
ones
that
tried
to
gore
him
the
farmer
hitched
a
horse
to
a
cart
loaded
with
tubs
of
butter
boxes
of
cheese
and
all
kinds
of
eatables
the
people
laughed
and
chattered
they
and
the
beasts
were
alike
merry
as
if
looking
forward
to
a
day
of
real
pleasure
a
moment
later
all
were
on
their
way
to
the
forest
one
of
the
girls
walked
in
the
lead
and
coaxed
the
cattle
with
pretty
musical
calls
the
animals
followed
in
a
long
line
the
shepherd
boy
and
the
ran
hither
and
thither
to
see
that
no
creature
turned
from
the
right
course
and
last
came
the
farmer
and
his
hired
man
they
walked
beside
the
cart
to
prevent
its
being
upset
for
the
road
they
followed
was
a
narrow
stony
forest
path
it
may
have
been
the
custom
for
all
the
peasants
in
hälsingland
to
send
their
cattle
into
the
forests
on
the
same
day
or
perhaps
it
only
happened
so
that
year
at
any
rate
the
boy
saw
how
processions
of
happy
people
and
cattle
wandered
out
from
every
valley
and
every
farm
and
rushed
into
the
lonely
forest
filling
it
with
life
from
the
depths
of
the
dense
woods
the
boy
heard
the
shepherd
maidens
songs
and
the
tinkle
of
the
cow
bells
many
of
the
processions
had
long
and
difficult
roads
to
travel
and
the
boy
saw
how
they
tramped
through
marshes
how
they
had
to
take
roundabout
ways
to
get
past
windfalls
and
how
time
and
again
the
carts
bumped
against
stones
and
turned
over
with
all
their
contents
but
the
people
met
all
the
obstacles
with
jokes
and
laughter
in
the
afternoon
they
came
to
a
cleared
space
where
cattle
sheds
and
a
couple
of
rude
cabins
had
been
built
the
cows
mooed
with
delight
as
they
tramped
on
the
luscious
green
grass
in
the
yards
between
the
cabins
and
at
once
began
grazing
the
peasants
with
merry
chatter
and
banter
carried
water
and
wood
and
all
that
had
been
brought
in
the
carts
into
the
larger
cabin
presently
smoke
rose
from
the
chimney
and
then
the
dairymaids
the
shepherd
boy
and
the
men
squatted
upon
a
flat
rock
and
ate
their
supper
gorgo
the
eagle
was
certain
that
he
should
find
clement
larsson
among
those
who
were
off
for
the
forest
whenever
he
saw
a
stock
farm
procession
he
sank
down
and
scrutinized
it
with
his
sharp
eyes
but
hour
after
hour
passed
without
his
finding
the
one
he
sought
after
much
circling
around
toward
evening
they
came
to
a
stony
and
desolate
tract
east
of
the
great
main
valley
there
the
boy
saw
another
outlying
stock
farm
under
him
the
people
and
the
cattle
had
arrived
the
men
were
splitting
wood
and
the
dairymaids
were
milking
the
cows
look
there
said
gorgo
i
think
we
got
him
he
sank
and
to
his
great
astonishment
the
boy
saw
that
the
eagle
was
right
there
indeed
stood
little
clement
larsson
chopping
wood
gorgo
alighted
on
a
pine
tree
in
the
thick
woods
a
little
away
from
the
house
i
have
fulfilled
my
obligation
said
the
eagle
with
a
proud
toss
of
his
head
now
you
must
try
and
have
a
word
with
the
man
i
perch
here
at
the
top
of
the
thick
pine
and
wait
for
you
the
animals
new
year
eve
the
day
work
was
done
at
the
forest
ranches
supper
was
over
and
the
peasants
sat
about
and
chatted
it
was
a
long
time
since
they
had
been
in
the
forest
of
a
summer
night
and
they
seemed
reluctant
to
go
to
bed
and
sleep
it
was
as
light
as
day
and
the
dairymaids
were
busy
with
their
ever
and
anon
they
raised
their
heads
looked
toward
the
forest
and
smiled
now
we
are
here
again
they
said
the
town
with
its
unrest
faded
from
their
minds
and
the
forest
with
its
peaceful
stillness
enfolded
them
when
at
home
they
had
wondered
how
they
should
ever
be
able
to
endure
the
loneliness
of
the
woods
but
once
there
they
felt
that
they
were
having
their
best
time
many
of
the
young
girls
and
young
men
from
neighbouring
ranches
had
come
to
call
upon
them
so
that
there
were
quite
a
lot
of
folk
seated
on
the
grass
before
the
cabins
but
they
did
not
find
it
easy
to
start
conversation
the
men
were
going
home
the
next
day
so
the
dairymaids
gave
them
little
commissions
and
bade
them
take
greetings
to
their
friends
in
the
village
this
was
nearly
all
that
had
been
said
suddenly
the
eldest
of
the
dairy
girls
looked
up
from
her
work
and
said
laughingly
there
no
need
of
our
sitting
here
so
silent
for
we
have
two
with
us
one
is
clement
larsson
who
sits
beside
me
and
the
other
is
bernhard
from
sunnasjö
who
stands
back
there
gazing
toward
black
ridge
i
think
that
we
should
ask
each
of
them
to
tell
us
a
story
to
the
one
who
entertains
us
the
better
i
shall
give
the
muffler
i
am
knitting
this
proposal
won
hearty
applause
the
two
competitors
offered
lame
excuses
naturally
but
were
quickly
persuaded
clement
asked
bernhard
to
begin
and
he
did
not
object
he
knew
little
of
clement
larsson
but
assumed
that
he
would
come
out
with
some
story
about
ghosts
and
trolls
as
he
knew
that
people
liked
to
listen
to
such
things
he
thought
it
best
to
choose
something
of
the
same
sort
some
centuries
ago
he
began
a
dean
here
in
delsbo
township
was
riding
through
the
dense
forest
on
a
new
year
eve
he
was
on
horseback
dressed
in
fur
coat
and
cap
on
the
pommel
of
his
saddle
hung
a
satchel
in
which
he
kept
the
communion
service
the
and
the
clerical
robe
he
had
been
summoned
on
a
parochial
errand
to
a
remote
forest
settlement
where
he
had
talked
with
a
sick
person
until
late
in
the
evening
now
he
was
on
his
way
home
but
feared
that
he
should
not
get
back
to
the
rectory
until
after
midnight
as
he
had
to
sit
in
the
saddle
when
he
should
have
been
at
home
in
his
bed
he
was
glad
it
was
not
a
rough
night
the
weather
was
mild
the
air
still
and
the
skies
overcast
behind
the
clouds
hung
a
full
round
moon
which
gave
some
light
although
it
was
out
of
sight
but
for
that
faint
light
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
distinguish
paths
from
fields
for
that
was
a
snowless
winter
and
all
things
had
the
same
colour
the
horse
the
dean
rode
was
one
he
prized
very
highly
he
was
strong
and
sturdy
and
quite
as
wise
as
a
human
being
he
could
find
his
way
home
from
any
place
in
the
township
the
dean
had
observed
this
on
several
occasions
and
he
relied
upon
it
with
such
a
sense
of
security
that
he
never
troubled
himself
to
think
where
he
was
going
when
he
rode
that
horse
so
he
came
along
now
in
the
gray
night
through
the
bewildering
forest
with
the
reins
dangling
and
his
thoughts
far
away
he
was
thinking
of
the
sermon
he
had
to
preach
on
the
morrow
and
of
much
else
besides
and
it
was
a
long
time
before
it
occurred
to
him
to
notice
how
far
along
he
was
on
his
homeward
way
when
he
did
glance
up
he
saw
that
the
forest
was
as
dense
about
him
as
at
the
beginning
and
he
was
somewhat
surprised
for
he
had
ridden
so
long
that
he
should
have
come
to
the
inhabited
portion
of
the
township
delsbo
was
about
the
same
then
as
now
the
church
and
parsonage
and
all
the
large
farms
and
villages
were
at
the
northern
end
of
the
township
while
at
the
southern
part
there
were
only
forests
and
mountains
the
dean
saw
that
he
was
still
in
the
unpopulated
district
and
knew
that
he
was
in
the
southern
part
and
must
ride
to
the
north
to
get
home
there
were
no
stars
nor
was
there
a
moon
to
guide
him
but
he
was
a
man
who
had
the
four
cardinal
points
in
his
head
he
had
the
positive
feeling
that
he
was
travelling
southward
or
possibly
eastward
he
intended
to
turn
the
horse
at
once
but
hesitated
the
animal
had
never
strayed
and
it
did
not
seem
likely
that
he
would
do
so
now
it
was
more
likely
that
the
dean
was
mistaken
he
had
been
far
away
in
thought
and
had
not
looked
at
the
road
so
he
let
the
horse
continue
in
the
same
direction
and
again
lost
himself
in
his
reverie
suddenly
a
big
branch
struck
him
and
almost
swept
him
off
the
horse
then
he
realized
that
he
must
find
out
where
he
was
he
glanced
down
and
saw
that
he
was
riding
over
a
soft
marsh
where
there
was
no
beaten
path
the
horse
trotted
along
at
a
brisk
pace
and
showed
no
uncertainty
again
the
dean
was
positive
that
he
was
going
in
the
wrong
direction
and
now
he
did
not
hesitate
to
interfere
he
seized
the
reins
and
turned
the
horse
about
guiding
him
back
to
the
roadway
no
sooner
was
he
there
than
he
turned
again
and
made
straight
for
the
woods
the
dean
was
certain
that
he
was
going
wrong
but
because
the
beast
was
so
persistent
he
thought
that
probably
he
was
trying
to
find
a
better
road
and
let
him
go
along
the
horse
did
very
well
although
he
had
no
path
to
follow
if
a
precipice
obstructed
his
way
he
climbed
it
as
nimbly
as
a
goat
and
later
when
they
had
to
descend
he
bunched
his
hoofs
and
slid
down
the
rocky
inclines
he
only
find
his
way
home
before
church
hour
thought
the
dean
wonder
how
the
delsbo
folk
would
take
it
if
i
were
not
at
my
church
on
time
he
did
not
have
to
brood
over
this
long
for
soon
he
came
to
a
place
that
was
familiar
to
him
it
was
a
little
creek
where
he
had
fished
the
summer
before
now
he
saw
it
was
as
he
had
feared
he
was
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
and
the
horse
was
plodding
along
in
a
direction
he
seemed
determined
to
carry
the
dean
as
far
from
church
and
rectory
as
he
could
the
clergyman
dismounted
he
could
not
let
the
horse
carry
him
into
the
wilderness
he
must
go
home
and
since
the
animal
persisted
in
going
in
the
wrong
direction
he
decided
to
walk
and
lead
him
until
they
came
to
more
familiar
roads
the
dean
wound
the
reins
around
his
arm
and
began
to
walk
it
was
not
an
easy
matter
to
tramp
through
the
forest
in
a
heavy
fur
coat
but
the
dean
was
strong
and
hardy
and
had
little
fear
of
overexertion
the
horse
meanwhile
caused
him
fresh
anxiety
he
would
not
follow
but
planted
his
hoofs
firmly
on
the
ground
at
last
the
dean
was
angry
he
had
never
beaten
that
horse
nor
did
he
wish
to
do
so
now
instead
he
threw
down
the
reins
and
walked
away
may
as
well
part
company
here
since
you
want
to
go
your
own
way
he
said
he
had
not
taken
more
than
two
steps
before
the
horse
came
after
him
took
a
cautious
grip
on
his
coat
sleeve
and
stopped
him
the
dean
turned
and
looked
the
horse
straight
in
the
eyes
as
if
to
search
out
why
he
behaved
so
strangely
afterward
the
dean
could
not
quite
understand
how
this
was
possible
but
it
is
certain
that
dark
as
it
was
he
plainly
saw
the
horse
face
and
read
it
like
that
of
a
human
being
he
realized
that
the
animal
was
in
a
terrible
state
of
apprehension
and
fear
he
gave
his
master
a
look
that
was
both
imploring
and
reproachful
have
served
you
day
after
day
and
done
your
bidding
he
seemed
to
say
you
not
follow
me
this
one
night
the
dean
was
touched
by
the
appeal
in
the
animal
eyes
it
was
clear
that
the
horse
needed
his
help
in
one
way
or
another
being
a
man
through
and
through
the
dean
promptly
determined
to
follow
him
without
further
delay
he
sprang
into
the
saddle
on
he
said
will
not
desert
you
since
you
want
me
no
one
shall
say
of
the
dean
in
delsbo
that
he
refused
to
accompany
any
creature
who
was
in
trouble
he
let
the
horse
go
as
he
wished
and
thought
only
of
keeping
his
seat
it
proved
to
be
a
hazardous
and
troublesome
journey
uphill
most
of
the
way
the
forest
was
so
thick
that
he
could
not
see
two
feet
ahead
but
it
appeared
to
him
that
they
were
ascending
a
high
mountain
the
horse
climbed
perilous
steeps
had
the
dean
been
guiding
he
should
not
have
thought
of
riding
over
such
ground
you
do
intend
to
go
up
to
black
ridge
do
you
laughed
the
dean
who
knew
that
was
one
of
the
highest
peaks
in
hälsingland
during
the
ride
he
discovered
that
he
and
the
horse
were
not
the
only
ones
who
were
out
that
night
he
heard
stones
roll
down
and
branches
crackle
as
if
animals
were
breaking
their
way
through
the
forest
he
remembered
that
wolves
were
plentiful
in
that
section
and
wondered
if
the
horse
wished
to
lead
him
to
an
encounter
with
wild
beasts
they
mounted
up
and
up
and
the
higher
they
went
the
more
scattered
were
the
trees
at
last
they
rode
on
almost
bare
highland
where
the
dean
could
look
in
every
direction
he
gazed
out
over
immeasurable
tracts
of
land
which
went
up
and
down
in
mountains
and
valleys
covered
with
sombre
forests
it
was
so
dark
that
he
had
difficulty
in
seeing
any
orderly
arrangement
but
presently
he
could
make
out
where
he
was
of
course
it
black
ridge
that
i
come
to
he
remarked
to
himself
ca
be
any
other
mountain
for
there
in
the
west
i
see
jarv
island
and
to
the
east
the
sea
glitters
around
ag
island
toward
the
north
also
i
see
something
shiny
it
must
be
dellen
in
the
depths
below
me
i
see
white
smoke
from
nian
falls
yes
i
up
on
ridge
what
an
adventure
when
they
were
at
the
summit
the
horse
stopped
behind
a
thick
pine
as
if
to
hide
the
dean
bent
forward
and
pushed
aside
the
branches
that
he
might
have
an
unobstructed
view
the
mountain
bald
plate
confronted
him
it
was
not
empty
and
desolate
as
he
had
anticipated
in
the
middle
of
the
open
space
was
an
immense
boulder
around
which
many
wild
beasts
had
gathered
apparently
they
were
holding
a
conclave
of
some
sort
near
to
the
big
rock
he
saw
bears
so
firmly
and
heavily
built
that
they
seemed
like
blocks
of
stone
they
were
lying
down
and
their
little
eyes
blinked
impatiently
it
was
obvious
that
they
had
come
from
their
winter
sleep
to
attend
court
and
that
they
could
hardly
keep
awake
behind
them
in
tight
rows
were
hundreds
of
wolves
they
were
not
sleepy
for
wolves
are
more
alert
in
winter
than
in
summer
they
sat
upon
their
haunches
like
dogs
whipping
the
ground
with
their
tails
and
panting
their
tongues
lolling
far
out
of
their
jaws
behind
the
wolves
the
lynx
skulked
and
clumsy
like
misshapen
cats
they
were
loath
to
be
among
the
other
beasts
and
hissed
and
spat
when
one
came
near
them
the
row
back
of
the
lynx
was
occupied
by
the
wolverines
with
dog
faces
and
bear
coats
they
were
not
happy
on
the
ground
and
they
stamped
their
pads
impatiently
longing
to
get
into
the
trees
behind
them
covering
the
entire
space
to
the
forest
border
leaped
the
foxes
the
weasels
and
the
martens
these
were
small
and
perfectly
formed
but
they
looked
even
more
savage
and
bloodthirsty
than
the
larger
beasts
all
this
the
dean
plainly
saw
for
the
whole
place
was
illuminated
upon
the
huge
rock
at
the
centre
was
the
who
held
in
her
hand
a
pine
torch
which
burned
in
a
big
red
flame
the
nymph
was
as
tall
as
the
tallest
tree
in
the
forest
she
wore
a
mantle
and
had
hair
she
stood
very
still
her
face
turned
toward
the
forest
she
was
watching
and
listening
the
dean
saw
everything
as
plain
as
plain
could
be
but
his
astonishment
was
so
great
that
he
tried
to
combat
it
and
would
not
believe
the
evidence
of
his
own
eyes
things
can
not
possibly
happen
he
thought
have
ridden
much
too
long
in
the
bleak
forest
this
is
only
an
optical
illusion
nevertheless
he
gave
the
closest
attention
to
the
spectacle
and
wondered
what
was
about
to
be
done
he
had
long
to
wait
before
he
caught
the
sound
of
a
familiar
bell
coming
from
the
depths
of
the
forest
and
the
next
moment
he
heard
footfalls
and
crackling
of
branches
as
when
many
animals
break
through
the
forest
a
big
herd
of
cattle
was
climbing
the
mountain
they
came
through
the
forest
in
the
order
in
which
they
had
marched
to
the
mountain
ranches
first
came
the
bell
cow
followed
by
the
bull
then
the
other
cows
and
the
calves
the
sheep
closely
herded
followed
after
them
came
the
goats
and
last
were
the
horses
and
colts
the
trotted
along
beside
the
sheep
but
neither
shepherd
nor
shepherdess
attended
them
the
dean
thought
it
to
see
the
tame
animals
coming
straight
toward
the
wild
beasts
he
would
gladly
have
blocked
their
way
and
called
but
he
understood
that
it
was
not
within
human
power
to
stop
the
march
of
the
cattle
on
this
night
therefore
he
made
no
move
the
domestic
animals
were
in
a
state
of
torment
over
that
which
they
had
to
face
if
it
happened
to
be
the
bell
cow
turn
she
advanced
with
drooping
head
and
faltering
step
the
goats
had
no
desire
either
to
play
or
to
butt
the
horses
tried
to
bear
up
bravely
but
their
bodies
were
all
of
a
quiver
with
fright
the
most
pathetic
of
all
was
the
he
kept
his
tail
between
his
legs
and
crawled
on
the
ground
the
bell
cow
led
the
procession
all
the
way
up
to
the
who
stood
on
the
boulder
at
the
top
of
the
mountain
the
cow
walked
around
the
rock
and
then
turned
toward
the
forest
without
any
of
the
wild
beasts
touching
her
in
the
same
way
all
the
cattle
walked
unmolested
past
the
wild
beasts
as
the
creatures
filed
past
the
dean
saw
the
lower
her
pine
torch
over
one
and
another
of
them
every
time
this
occurred
the
beasts
of
prey
broke
into
loud
exultant
roars
particularly
when
it
was
lowered
over
a
cow
or
some
other
large
creature
the
animal
that
saw
the
torch
turning
toward
it
uttered
a
piercing
shriek
as
if
it
had
received
a
knife
thrust
in
its
flesh
while
the
entire
herd
to
which
it
belonged
bellowed
their
lamentations
then
the
dean
began
to
comprehend
the
meaning
of
what
he
saw
surely
he
had
heard
that
the
animals
in
delsbo
assembled
on
black
ridge
every
new
year
eve
that
the
might
mark
out
which
among
the
tame
beasts
would
that
year
be
prey
for
the
wild
beasts
the
dean
pitied
the
poor
creatures
that
were
at
the
mercy
of
savage
beasts
when
in
reality
they
should
have
no
master
but
man
the
leading
herd
had
only
just
left
when
another
bell
tinkled
and
the
cattle
from
another
farm
tramped
to
the
mountain
top
these
came
in
the
same
order
as
the
first
and
marched
past
the
who
stood
there
stern
and
solemn
indicating
animal
after
animal
for
death
herd
upon
herd
followed
without
a
break
in
the
line
of
procession
some
were
so
small
that
they
included
only
one
cow
and
a
few
sheep
others
consisted
of
only
a
pair
of
goats
it
was
apparent
that
these
were
from
very
humble
homes
but
they
too
were
compelled
to
pass
in
review
the
dean
thought
of
the
delsbo
farmers
who
had
so
much
love
for
their
beasts
they
but
know
of
it
surely
they
would
not
allow
a
repetition
of
this
he
thought
would
risk
their
own
lives
rather
than
let
their
cattle
wander
amongst
bears
and
wolves
to
be
doomed
by
the
the
last
herd
to
appear
was
the
one
from
the
rectory
farm
the
dean
heard
the
sound
of
the
familiar
bell
a
long
way
off
the
horse
too
must
have
heard
it
for
he
began
to
shake
in
every
limb
and
was
bathed
in
sweat
it
is
your
turn
now
to
pass
before
the
to
receive
your
sentence
the
dean
said
to
the
horse
be
afraid
now
i
know
why
you
brought
me
here
and
i
shall
not
leave
you
the
fine
cattle
from
the
parsonage
farm
emerged
from
the
forest
and
marched
to
the
and
the
wild
beasts
last
in
the
line
was
the
horse
that
had
brought
his
master
to
black
ridge
the
dean
did
not
leave
the
saddle
but
let
the
animal
take
him
to
the
he
had
neither
knife
nor
gun
for
his
defence
but
he
had
taken
out
the
and
sat
pressing
it
to
his
heart
as
he
exposed
himself
to
battle
against
evil
at
first
it
appeared
as
if
none
had
observed
him
the
dean
cattle
filed
past
the
in
the
same
order
as
the
others
had
done
she
did
not
wave
the
torch
toward
any
of
these
but
as
soon
as
the
intelligent
horse
stepped
forward
she
made
a
movement
to
mark
him
for
death
instantly
the
dean
held
up
the
and
the
torchlight
fell
upon
the
cross
on
its
cover
the
uttered
a
loud
shrill
cry
and
let
the
torch
drop
from
her
hand
immediately
the
flame
was
extinguished
in
the
sudden
transition
from
light
to
darkness
the
dean
saw
nothing
nor
did
he
hear
anything
about
him
reigned
the
profound
stillness
of
a
wilderness
in
winter
then
the
dark
clouds
parted
and
through
the
opening
stepped
the
full
round
moon
to
shed
its
light
upon
the
ground
the
dean
saw
that
he
and
the
horse
were
alone
on
the
summit
of
black
ridge
not
one
of
the
many
wild
beasts
was
there
the
ground
had
not
been
trampled
by
the
herds
that
had
passed
over
it
but
the
dean
himself
sat
with
his
before
him
while
the
horse
under
him
stood
trembling
and
foaming
by
the
time
the
dean
reached
home
he
no
longer
knew
whether
or
not
it
had
been
a
dream
a
vision
or
reality
this
that
he
had
seen
but
he
took
it
as
a
warning
to
him
to
remember
the
poor
creatures
who
were
at
the
mercy
of
wild
beasts
he
preached
so
powerfully
to
the
delsbo
peasants
that
in
his
day
all
the
wolves
and
bears
were
exterminated
from
that
section
of
the
country
although
they
may
have
returned
since
his
time
here
bernhard
ended
his
story
he
received
praise
from
all
sides
and
it
seemed
to
be
a
foregone
conclusion
that
he
would
get
the
prize
the
majority
thought
it
almost
a
pity
that
clement
had
to
compete
with
him
but
clement
undaunted
began
one
day
while
i
was
living
at
skansen
just
outside
of
stockholm
and
longing
for
home
then
he
told
about
the
tiny
midget
he
had
ransomed
so
that
he
would
not
have
to
be
confined
in
a
cage
to
be
stared
at
by
all
the
people
he
told
also
that
no
sooner
had
he
performed
this
act
of
mercy
than
he
was
rewarded
for
it
he
talked
and
talked
and
the
astonishment
of
his
hearers
grew
greater
and
greater
but
when
he
came
to
the
royal
lackey
and
the
beautiful
book
all
the
dairymaids
dropped
their
and
sat
staring
at
clement
in
wonder
at
his
marvellous
experiences
as
soon
as
clement
had
finished
the
eldest
of
the
dairymaids
announced
that
he
should
have
the
muffler
bernhard
related
only
things
that
happened
to
another
but
clement
has
himself
been
the
hero
of
a
true
story
which
i
consider
far
more
important
in
this
all
concurred
they
regarded
clement
with
very
different
eyes
after
hearing
that
he
had
talked
with
the
king
and
the
little
fiddler
was
afraid
to
show
how
proud
he
felt
but
at
the
very
height
of
his
elation
some
one
asked
him
what
had
become
of
the
midget
i
had
no
time
to
set
out
the
blue
bowl
for
him
myself
said
clement
so
i
asked
the
old
laplander
to
do
it
what
has
become
of
him
since
then
i
do
know
no
sooner
had
he
spoken
than
a
little
pine
cone
came
along
and
struck
him
on
the
nose
it
did
not
drop
from
a
tree
and
none
of
the
peasants
had
thrown
it
it
was
simply
impossible
to
tell
whence
it
had
come
aha
clement
winked
the
dairymaid
it
appears
as
if
the
tiny
folk
were
listening
to
us
you
should
not
have
left
it
to
another
to
set
out
that
blue
bowl
in
medelpad
june
the
boy
and
the
eagle
were
out
bright
and
early
the
next
morning
gorgo
hoped
that
he
would
get
far
up
into
west
bothnia
that
day
as
luck
would
have
it
he
heard
the
boy
remark
to
himself
that
in
a
country
like
the
one
through
which
they
were
now
travelling
it
must
be
impossible
for
people
to
live
the
land
which
spread
below
them
was
southern
medelpad
when
the
eagle
heard
the
boy
remark
he
replied
up
here
they
have
forests
for
fields
the
boy
thought
of
the
contrast
between
the
light
fields
with
their
delicate
blades
that
spring
up
in
one
summer
and
the
dark
spruce
forest
with
its
solid
trees
which
took
many
years
to
ripen
for
harvest
one
who
has
to
get
his
livelihood
from
such
a
field
must
have
a
deal
of
patience
he
observed
nothing
more
was
said
until
they
came
to
a
place
where
the
forest
had
been
cleared
and
the
ground
was
covered
with
stumps
and
branches
as
they
flew
over
this
ground
the
eagle
heard
the
boy
mutter
to
himself
that
it
was
a
mighty
ugly
and
place
this
field
was
cleared
last
winter
said
the
eagle
the
boy
thought
of
the
harvesters
at
home
who
rode
on
their
reaping
machines
on
fine
summer
mornings
and
in
a
short
time
mowed
a
large
field
but
the
forest
field
was
harvested
in
winter
the
lumbermen
went
out
in
the
wilderness
when
the
snow
was
deep
and
the
cold
most
severe
it
was
tedious
work
to
fell
even
one
tree
and
to
hew
down
a
forest
such
as
this
they
must
have
been
out
in
the
open
many
weeks
they
have
to
be
hardy
men
to
mow
a
field
of
this
kind
he
said
when
the
eagle
had
taken
two
more
wing
strokes
they
sighted
a
log
cabin
at
the
edge
of
the
clearing
it
had
no
windows
and
only
two
loose
boards
for
a
door
the
roof
had
been
covered
with
bark
and
twigs
but
now
it
was
gaping
and
the
boy
could
see
that
inside
the
cabin
there
were
only
a
few
big
stones
to
serve
as
a
fireplace
and
two
board
benches
when
they
were
above
the
cabin
the
eagle
suspected
that
the
boy
was
wondering
who
could
have
lived
in
such
a
wretched
hut
as
that
the
reapers
who
mowed
the
forest
field
lived
there
the
eagle
said
the
boy
remembered
how
the
reapers
in
his
home
had
returned
from
their
day
work
cheerful
and
happy
and
how
the
best
his
mother
had
in
the
larder
was
always
spread
for
them
while
here
after
the
arduous
work
of
the
day
they
must
rest
on
hard
benches
in
a
cabin
that
was
worse
than
an
outhouse
and
what
they
had
to
eat
he
could
not
imagine
i
wonder
if
there
are
any
harvest
festivals
for
these
labourers
he
questioned
a
little
farther
on
they
saw
below
them
a
wretchedly
bad
road
winding
through
the
forest
it
was
narrow
and
zigzag
hilly
and
stony
and
cut
up
by
brooks
in
many
places
as
they
flew
over
it
the
eagle
knew
that
the
boy
was
wondering
what
was
carted
over
a
road
like
that
over
this
road
the
harvest
was
conveyed
to
the
stack
the
eagle
said
the
boy
recalled
what
fun
they
had
at
home
when
the
harvest
wagons
drawn
by
two
sturdy
horses
carried
the
grain
from
the
field
the
man
who
drove
sat
proudly
on
top
of
the
load
the
horses
danced
and
pricked
up
their
ears
while
the
village
children
who
were
allowed
to
climb
upon
the
sheaves
sat
there
laughing
and
shrieking
but
here
the
great
logs
were
drawn
up
and
down
steep
hills
here
the
poor
horses
must
be
worked
to
their
limit
and
the
driver
must
often
be
in
peril
i
afraid
there
has
been
very
little
cheer
along
this
road
the
boy
observed
the
eagle
flew
on
with
powerful
wing
strokes
and
soon
they
came
to
a
river
bank
covered
with
logs
chips
and
bark
the
eagle
perceived
that
the
boy
wondered
why
it
looked
so
littered
up
down
there
here
the
harvest
has
been
stacked
the
eagle
told
him
the
boy
thought
of
how
the
grain
stacks
in
his
part
of
the
country
were
piled
up
close
to
the
farms
as
if
they
were
their
greatest
ornaments
while
here
the
harvest
was
borne
to
a
desolate
river
strand
and
left
there
i
wonder
if
any
one
out
in
this
wilderness
counts
his
stacks
and
compares
them
with
his
neighbour
he
said
a
little
later
they
came
to
ljungen
a
river
which
glides
through
a
broad
valley
immediately
everything
was
so
changed
that
they
might
well
think
they
had
come
to
another
country
the
dark
spruce
forest
had
stopped
on
the
inclines
above
the
valley
and
the
slopes
were
clad
in
birches
and
aspens
the
valley
was
so
broad
that
in
many
places
the
river
widened
into
lakes
along
the
shores
lay
a
large
flourishing
town
as
they
soared
above
the
valley
the
eagle
realized
that
the
boy
was
wondering
if
the
fields
and
meadows
here
could
provide
a
livelihood
for
so
many
people
here
live
the
reapers
who
mow
the
forest
fields
the
eagle
said
the
boy
was
thinking
of
the
lowly
cabins
and
the
farms
down
in
skåne
when
he
exclaimed
why
here
the
peasants
live
in
real
manors
it
looks
as
if
it
might
be
worth
one
while
to
work
in
the
forest
the
eagle
had
intended
to
travel
straight
north
but
when
he
had
flown
out
over
the
river
he
understood
that
the
boy
wondered
who
handled
the
timber
after
it
was
stacked
on
the
river
bank
the
boy
recollected
how
careful
they
had
been
at
home
never
to
let
a
grain
be
wasted
while
here
were
great
rafts
of
logs
floating
down
the
river
uncared
for
he
could
not
believe
that
more
than
half
of
the
logs
ever
reached
their
destination
many
were
floating
in
midstream
and
for
them
all
went
smoothly
others
moved
close
to
the
shore
bumping
against
points
of
land
and
some
were
left
behind
in
the
still
waters
of
the
creeks
on
the
lakes
there
were
so
many
logs
that
they
covered
the
entire
surface
of
the
water
these
appeared
to
be
lodged
for
an
indefinite
period
at
the
bridges
they
stuck
in
the
falls
they
were
bunched
then
they
were
pyramided
and
broken
in
two
afterward
in
the
rapids
they
were
blocked
by
the
stones
and
massed
into
great
heaps
i
wonder
how
long
it
takes
for
the
logs
to
get
to
the
mill
said
the
boy
the
eagle
continued
his
slow
flight
down
river
ljungen
over
many
places
he
paused
in
the
air
on
outspread
wings
that
the
boy
might
see
how
this
kind
of
harvest
work
was
done
presently
they
came
to
a
place
where
the
loggers
were
at
work
the
eagle
marked
that
the
boy
wondered
what
they
were
doing
they
are
the
ones
who
take
care
of
all
the
belated
harvest
the
eagle
said
the
boy
remembered
the
perfect
ease
with
which
his
people
at
home
had
driven
their
grain
to
the
mill
here
the
men
ran
alongside
the
shores
with
long
and
with
toil
and
effort
urged
the
logs
along
they
waded
out
in
the
river
and
were
soaked
from
top
to
toe
they
jumped
from
stone
to
stone
far
out
into
the
rapids
and
they
tramped
on
the
rolling
log
heaps
as
calmly
as
though
they
were
on
flat
ground
they
were
daring
and
resolute
men
as
i
watch
this
i
reminded
of
the
in
the
mining
districts
who
juggle
with
fire
as
if
it
were
perfectly
harmless
remarked
the
boy
these
loggers
play
with
water
as
if
they
were
its
masters
they
seem
to
have
subjugated
it
so
that
it
dare
not
harm
them
gradually
they
neared
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
bothnia
bay
was
beyond
them
gorgo
flew
no
farther
straight
ahead
but
went
northward
along
the
coast
before
they
had
travelled
very
far
they
saw
a
lumber
camp
as
large
as
a
small
city
while
the
eagle
circled
back
and
forth
above
it
he
heard
the
boy
remark
that
this
place
looked
interesting
here
you
have
the
great
lumber
camp
called
svartvik
the
eagle
said
the
boy
thought
of
the
mill
at
home
which
stood
peacefully
embedded
in
foliage
and
moved
its
wings
very
slowly
this
mill
where
they
grind
the
forest
harvest
stood
on
the
water
the
mill
pond
was
crowded
with
logs
one
by
one
the
helpers
seized
them
with
their
crowded
them
into
the
chutes
and
hurried
them
along
to
the
whirling
saws
what
happened
to
the
logs
inside
the
boy
could
not
see
but
he
heard
loud
buzzing
and
roaring
and
from
the
other
end
of
the
house
small
cars
ran
out
loaded
with
white
planks
the
cars
ran
on
shining
tracks
down
to
the
lumber
yard
where
the
planks
were
piled
in
rows
forming
streets
like
blocks
of
houses
in
a
city
in
one
place
they
were
building
new
piles
in
another
they
were
pulling
down
old
ones
these
were
carried
aboard
two
large
vessels
which
lay
waiting
for
cargo
the
place
was
alive
with
workmen
and
in
the
woods
back
of
the
yard
they
had
their
homes
they
soon
manage
to
saw
up
all
the
forests
in
medelpad
the
way
they
work
here
said
the
boy
the
eagle
moved
his
wings
just
a
little
and
carried
the
boy
above
another
large
camp
very
much
like
the
first
with
the
mill
yard
wharf
and
the
homes
of
the
workmen
this
is
called
kukikenborg
the
eagle
said
he
flapped
his
wings
slowly
flew
past
two
big
lumber
camps
and
approached
a
large
city
when
the
eagle
heard
the
boy
ask
the
name
of
it
he
cried
this
is
sundsvall
the
manor
of
the
lumber
districts
the
boy
remembered
the
cities
of
skåne
which
looked
so
old
and
gray
and
solemn
while
here
in
the
bleak
north
the
city
of
sundsvall
faced
a
beautiful
bay
and
looked
young
and
happy
and
beaming
there
was
something
odd
about
the
city
when
one
saw
it
from
above
for
in
the
middle
stood
a
cluster
of
tall
stone
structures
which
looked
so
imposing
that
their
match
was
hardly
to
be
found
in
stockholm
around
the
stone
buildings
there
was
a
large
open
space
then
came
a
wreath
of
frame
houses
which
looked
pretty
and
cosy
in
their
little
gardens
but
they
seemed
to
be
conscious
of
the
fact
that
they
were
very
much
poorer
than
the
stone
houses
and
dared
not
venture
into
their
neighbourhood
this
must
be
both
a
wealthy
and
powerful
city
remarked
the
boy
can
it
be
possible
that
the
poor
forest
soil
is
the
source
of
all
this
the
eagle
flapped
his
wings
again
and
went
over
to
aln
island
which
lies
opposite
sundsvall
the
boy
was
greatly
surprised
to
see
all
the
sawmills
that
decked
the
shores
on
aln
island
they
stood
one
next
another
and
on
the
mainland
opposite
were
mill
upon
mill
lumber
yard
upon
lumber
yard
he
counted
forty
at
least
but
believed
there
were
many
more
how
wonderful
it
all
looks
from
up
here
he
marvelled
so
much
life
and
activity
i
have
not
seen
in
any
place
save
this
on
the
whole
trip
it
is
a
great
country
that
we
have
wherever
i
go
there
is
always
something
new
for
people
to
live
upon
a
morning
in
ångermanland
the
bread
june
next
morning
when
the
eagle
had
flown
some
distance
into
ångermanland
he
remarked
that
he
was
the
one
who
was
hungry
and
must
find
something
to
eat
he
set
the
boy
down
in
an
enormous
pine
on
a
high
mountain
ridge
and
away
he
flew
the
boy
found
a
comfortable
seat
in
a
cleft
branch
from
which
he
could
look
down
over
ångermanland
it
was
a
glorious
morning
the
sunshine
gilded
the
treetops
a
soft
breeze
played
in
the
pine
needles
the
sweetest
fragrance
was
wafted
through
the
forest
a
beautiful
landscape
spread
before
him
and
the
boy
himself
was
happy
and
he
felt
that
no
one
could
be
better
off
he
had
a
perfect
outlook
in
every
direction
the
country
west
of
him
was
all
peaks
and
and
the
farther
away
they
were
the
higher
and
wilder
they
looked
to
the
east
there
were
also
many
peaks
but
these
sank
lower
and
lower
toward
the
sea
where
the
land
became
perfectly
flat
everywhere
he
saw
shining
rivers
and
brooks
which
were
having
a
troublesome
journey
with
rapids
and
falls
so
long
as
they
ran
between
mountains
but
spread
out
clear
and
broad
as
they
neared
the
shore
of
the
coast
bothnia
bay
was
dotted
with
islands
and
notched
with
points
but
farther
out
was
open
blue
water
like
a
summer
sky
when
the
boy
had
had
enough
of
the
landscape
he
unloosed
his
knapsack
took
out
a
morsel
of
fine
white
bread
and
began
to
eat
i
do
think
i
ever
tasted
such
good
bread
said
he
and
how
much
i
have
left
there
enough
to
last
me
for
a
couple
of
days
as
he
munched
he
thought
of
how
he
had
come
by
the
bread
it
must
be
because
i
got
it
in
such
a
nice
way
that
it
tastes
so
good
to
me
he
said
the
golden
eagle
had
left
medelpad
the
evening
before
he
had
hardly
crossed
the
border
into
ångermanland
when
the
boy
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
fertile
valley
and
a
river
which
surpassed
anything
of
the
kind
he
had
seen
before
as
the
boy
glanced
down
at
the
rich
valley
he
complained
of
feeling
hungry
he
had
had
no
food
for
two
whole
days
he
said
and
now
he
was
famished
gorgo
did
not
wish
to
have
it
said
that
the
boy
had
fared
worse
in
his
company
than
when
he
travelled
with
the
wild
geese
so
he
slackened
his
speed
why
have
you
spoken
of
this
before
he
asked
you
shall
have
all
the
food
you
want
there
no
need
of
your
starving
when
you
have
an
eagle
for
a
travelling
companion
just
then
the
eagle
sighted
a
farmer
who
was
sowing
a
field
near
the
river
strand
the
man
carried
the
seeds
in
a
basket
suspended
from
his
neck
and
each
time
that
it
was
emptied
he
refilled
it
from
a
seed
sack
which
stood
at
the
end
of
the
furrow
the
eagle
reasoned
it
out
that
the
sack
must
be
filled
with
the
best
food
that
the
boy
could
wish
for
so
he
darted
toward
it
but
before
the
bird
could
get
there
a
terrible
clamour
arose
about
him
sparrows
crows
and
swallows
came
rushing
up
with
wild
shrieks
thinking
that
the
eagle
meant
to
swoop
down
upon
some
bird
away
away
robber
away
away
they
cried
they
made
such
a
racket
that
it
attracted
the
farmer
who
came
running
so
that
gorgo
had
to
flee
and
the
boy
got
no
seed
the
small
birds
behaved
in
the
most
extraordinary
manner
not
only
did
they
force
the
eagle
to
flee
they
pursued
him
a
long
distance
down
the
valley
and
everywhere
the
people
heard
their
cries
women
came
out
and
clapped
their
hands
so
that
it
sounded
like
a
volley
of
musketry
and
the
men
rushed
out
with
rifles
the
same
thing
was
repeated
every
time
the
eagle
swept
toward
the
ground
the
boy
abandoned
the
hope
that
the
eagle
could
procure
any
food
for
him
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
before
that
gorgo
was
so
much
hated
he
almost
pitied
him
in
a
little
while
they
came
to
a
homestead
where
the
housewife
had
just
been
baking
she
had
set
a
platter
of
sugared
buns
in
the
back
yard
to
cool
and
was
standing
beside
it
watching
so
that
the
cat
and
dog
should
not
steal
the
buns
the
eagle
circled
down
to
the
yard
but
dared
not
alight
right
under
the
eyes
of
the
peasant
woman
he
flew
up
and
down
irresolute
twice
he
came
down
as
far
as
the
chimney
then
rose
again
the
peasant
woman
noticed
the
eagle
she
raised
her
head
and
followed
him
with
her
glance
how
peculiarly
he
acts
she
remarked
i
believe
he
wants
one
of
my
buns
she
was
a
beautiful
woman
tall
and
fair
with
a
cheery
open
countenance
laughing
heartily
she
took
a
bun
from
the
platter
and
held
it
above
her
head
if
you
want
it
come
and
take
it
she
challenged
while
the
eagle
did
not
understand
her
language
he
knew
at
once
that
she
was
offering
him
the
bun
with
lightning
speed
he
swooped
to
the
bread
snatched
it
and
flew
toward
the
heights
when
the
boy
saw
the
eagle
snatch
the
bread
he
wept
for
joy
not
because
he
would
escape
suffering
hunger
for
a
few
days
but
because
he
was
touched
by
the
peasant
woman
sharing
her
bread
with
a
savage
bird
of
prey
where
he
now
sat
on
the
pine
branch
he
could
recall
at
will
the
tall
fair
woman
as
she
stood
in
the
yard
and
held
up
the
bread
she
must
have
known
that
the
large
bird
was
a
golden
eagle
a
plunderer
who
was
usually
welcomed
with
loud
shots
doubtless
she
had
also
seen
the
queer
changeling
he
bore
on
his
back
but
she
had
not
thought
of
what
they
were
as
soon
as
she
understood
that
they
were
hungry
she
shared
her
good
bread
with
them
if
i
ever
become
human
again
thought
the
boy
i
shall
look
up
the
pretty
woman
who
lives
near
the
great
river
and
thank
her
for
her
kindness
to
us
the
forest
fire
while
the
boy
was
still
at
his
breakfast
he
smelled
a
faint
odour
of
smoke
coming
from
the
north
he
turned
and
saw
a
tiny
spiral
white
as
a
mist
rise
from
a
forest
ridge
not
from
the
one
nearest
him
but
from
the
one
beyond
it
it
looked
strange
to
see
smoke
in
the
wild
forest
but
it
might
be
that
a
mountain
stock
farm
lay
over
yonder
and
the
women
were
boiling
their
morning
coffee
it
was
remarkable
the
way
that
smoke
increased
and
spread
it
could
not
come
from
a
ranch
but
perhaps
there
were
charcoal
kilns
in
the
forest
the
smoke
increased
every
moment
now
it
curled
over
the
whole
mountain
top
it
was
not
possible
that
so
much
smoke
could
come
from
a
charcoal
kiln
there
must
be
a
conflagration
of
some
sort
for
many
birds
flew
over
to
the
nearest
ridge
hawks
grouse
and
other
birds
who
were
so
small
that
it
was
impossible
to
recognize
them
at
such
a
distance
fled
from
the
fire
the
tiny
white
spiral
of
smoke
grew
to
a
thick
white
cloud
which
rolled
over
the
edge
of
the
ridge
and
sank
toward
the
valley
sparks
and
flakes
of
soot
shot
up
from
the
clouds
and
here
and
there
one
could
see
a
red
flame
in
the
smoke
a
big
fire
was
raging
over
there
but
what
was
burning
surely
there
was
no
large
farm
hidden
in
the
forest
the
source
of
such
a
fire
must
be
more
than
a
farm
now
the
smoke
came
not
only
from
the
ridge
but
from
the
valley
below
it
which
the
boy
could
not
see
because
the
next
ridge
obstructed
his
view
great
clouds
of
smoke
ascended
the
forest
itself
was
burning
it
was
difficult
for
him
to
grasp
the
idea
that
the
fresh
green
pines
could
burn
if
it
really
were
the
forest
that
was
burning
perhaps
the
fire
might
spread
all
the
way
over
to
him
it
seemed
improbable
but
he
wished
the
eagle
would
soon
return
it
would
be
best
to
be
away
from
this
the
mere
smell
of
the
smoke
which
he
drew
in
with
every
breath
was
a
torture
all
at
once
he
heard
a
terrible
crackling
and
sputtering
it
came
from
the
ridge
nearest
him
there
on
the
highest
point
stood
a
tall
pine
like
the
one
in
which
he
sat
a
moment
before
it
had
been
a
gorgeous
red
in
the
morning
light
now
all
the
needles
flashed
and
the
pine
caught
fire
never
before
had
it
looked
so
beautiful
but
this
was
the
last
time
it
could
exhibit
any
beauty
for
the
pine
was
the
first
tree
on
the
ridge
to
burn
it
was
impossible
to
tell
how
the
flames
had
reached
it
had
the
fire
flown
on
red
wings
or
crawled
along
the
ground
like
a
snake
it
was
not
easy
to
say
but
there
it
was
at
all
events
the
great
pine
burned
like
a
birch
stem
ah
look
now
smoke
curled
up
in
many
places
on
the
ridge
the
forest
fire
was
both
bird
and
snake
it
could
fly
in
the
air
over
wide
stretches
or
steal
along
the
ground
the
whole
ridge
was
ablaze
there
was
a
hasty
flight
of
birds
that
circled
up
through
the
smoke
like
big
flakes
of
soot
they
flew
across
the
valley
and
came
to
the
ridge
where
the
boy
sat
a
horned
owl
perched
beside
him
and
on
a
branch
just
above
him
a
hen
hawk
alighted
these
would
have
been
dangerous
neighbours
at
any
other
time
but
now
they
did
not
even
glance
in
his
direction
only
stared
at
the
fire
probably
they
could
not
make
out
what
was
wrong
with
the
forest
a
marten
ran
up
the
pine
to
the
tip
of
a
branch
and
looked
at
the
burning
heights
close
beside
the
marten
sat
a
squirrel
but
they
did
not
appear
to
notice
each
other
now
the
fire
came
rushing
down
the
slope
hissing
and
roaring
like
a
tornado
through
the
smoke
one
could
see
the
flames
dart
from
tree
to
tree
before
a
branch
caught
fire
it
was
first
enveloped
in
a
thin
veil
of
smoke
then
all
the
needles
grew
red
at
one
time
and
it
began
to
crackle
and
blaze
in
the
glen
below
ran
a
little
brook
bordered
by
elms
and
small
birches
it
appeared
as
if
the
flames
would
halt
there
leafy
trees
are
not
so
ready
to
take
fire
as
fir
trees
the
fire
did
pause
as
if
before
a
gate
that
could
stop
it
it
glowed
and
crackled
and
tried
to
leap
across
the
brook
to
the
pine
woods
on
the
other
side
but
could
not
reach
them
for
a
short
time
the
fire
was
thus
restrained
then
it
shot
a
long
flame
over
to
the
large
dry
pine
that
stood
on
the
slope
and
this
was
soon
ablaze
the
fire
had
crossed
the
brook
the
heat
was
so
intense
that
every
tree
on
the
mountain
was
ready
to
burn
with
the
roar
and
rush
of
the
maddest
storm
and
the
wildest
torrent
the
forest
fire
flew
over
to
the
ridge
then
the
hawk
and
the
owl
rose
and
the
marten
dashed
down
the
tree
in
a
few
seconds
more
the
fire
would
reach
the
top
of
the
pine
and
the
boy
too
would
have
to
be
moving
it
was
not
easy
to
slide
down
the
long
straight
pine
trunk
he
took
as
firm
a
hold
of
it
as
he
could
and
slid
in
long
stretches
between
the
knotty
branches
finally
he
tumbled
headlong
to
the
ground
he
had
no
time
to
find
out
if
he
was
hurt
only
to
hurry
away
the
fire
raced
down
the
pine
like
a
raging
tempest
the
ground
under
his
feet
was
hot
and
smouldering
on
either
side
of
him
ran
a
lynx
and
an
adder
and
right
beside
the
snake
fluttered
a
mother
grouse
who
was
hurrying
along
with
her
little
downy
chicks
when
the
refugees
descended
the
mountain
to
the
glen
they
met
people
fighting
the
fire
they
had
been
there
for
some
time
but
the
boy
had
been
gazing
so
intently
in
the
direction
of
the
fire
that
he
had
not
noticed
them
before
in
this
glen
there
was
a
brook
bordered
by
a
row
of
leaf
trees
and
back
of
these
trees
the
people
worked
they
felled
the
fir
trees
nearest
the
elms
dipped
water
from
the
brook
and
poured
it
over
the
ground
washing
away
heather
and
myrtle
to
prevent
the
fire
from
stealing
up
to
the
birch
brush
they
too
thought
only
of
the
fire
which
was
now
rushing
toward
them
the
fleeing
animals
ran
in
and
out
among
the
men
feet
without
attracting
attention
no
one
struck
at
the
adder
or
tried
to
catch
the
mother
grouse
as
she
ran
back
and
forth
with
her
little
peeping
birdlings
they
did
not
even
bother
about
thumbietot
in
their
hands
they
held
great
charred
pine
branches
which
had
dropped
into
the
brook
and
it
appeared
as
if
they
intended
to
challenge
the
fire
with
these
weapons
there
were
not
many
men
and
it
was
strange
to
see
them
stand
there
ready
to
fight
when
all
other
living
creatures
were
fleeing
as
the
fire
came
roaring
and
rushing
down
the
slope
with
its
intolerable
heat
and
suffocating
smoke
ready
to
hurl
itself
over
brook
and
wall
in
order
to
reach
the
opposite
shore
without
having
to
pause
the
people
drew
back
at
first
as
if
unable
to
withstand
it
but
they
did
not
flee
far
before
they
turned
back
the
conflagration
raged
with
savage
force
sparks
poured
like
a
rain
of
fire
over
the
leaf
trees
and
long
tongues
of
flame
shot
hissingly
out
from
the
smoke
as
if
the
forest
on
the
other
side
were
sucking
them
in
but
the
wall
was
an
obstruction
behind
which
the
men
worked
when
the
ground
began
to
smoulder
they
brought
water
in
their
vessels
and
dampened
it
when
a
tree
became
wreathed
in
smoke
they
felled
it
at
once
threw
it
down
and
put
out
the
flames
where
the
fire
crept
along
the
heather
they
beat
it
with
the
wet
pine
branches
and
smothered
it
the
smoke
was
so
dense
that
it
enveloped
everything
one
could
not
possibly
see
how
the
battle
was
going
but
it
was
easy
enough
to
understand
that
it
was
a
hard
fight
and
that
several
times
the
fire
came
near
penetrating
farther
but
think
after
a
while
the
loud
roar
of
the
flames
decreased
and
the
smoke
cleared
by
that
time
the
leaf
trees
had
lost
all
their
foliage
the
ground
under
them
was
charred
the
faces
of
the
men
were
blackened
by
smoke
and
dripping
with
sweat
but
the
forest
fire
was
conquered
it
had
ceased
to
flame
up
soft
white
smoke
crept
along
the
ground
and
from
it
peeped
out
a
lot
of
black
stumps
this
was
all
there
was
left
of
the
beautiful
forest
the
boy
scrambled
up
on
a
rock
so
that
he
might
see
how
the
fire
had
been
quenched
but
now
that
the
forest
was
saved
his
peril
began
the
owl
and
the
hawk
simultaneously
turned
their
eyes
toward
him
just
then
he
heard
a
familiar
voice
calling
to
him
gorgo
the
golden
eagle
came
sweeping
through
the
forest
and
soon
the
boy
was
soaring
among
the
clouds
rescued
from
every
peril
westbottom
and
lapland
the
five
scouts
once
at
skansen
the
boy
had
sat
under
the
steps
at
bollnäs
cottage
and
had
overheard
clement
larsson
and
the
old
laplander
talk
about
norrland
both
agreed
that
it
was
the
most
beautiful
part
of
sweden
clement
thought
that
the
southern
part
was
the
best
while
the
laplander
favoured
the
northern
part
as
they
argued
it
became
plain
that
clement
had
never
been
farther
north
than
härnösand
the
laplander
laughed
at
him
for
speaking
with
such
assurance
of
places
that
he
had
never
seen
i
think
i
shall
have
to
tell
you
a
story
clement
to
give
you
some
idea
of
lapland
since
you
have
not
seen
it
volunteered
the
laplander
it
shall
not
be
said
of
me
that
i
refuse
to
listen
to
a
story
retorted
clement
and
the
old
laplander
began
it
once
happened
that
the
birds
who
lived
down
in
sweden
south
of
the
great
saméland
thought
that
they
were
overcrowded
there
and
suggested
moving
northward
they
came
together
to
consider
the
matter
the
young
and
eager
birds
wished
to
start
at
once
but
the
older
and
wiser
ones
passed
a
resolution
to
send
scouts
to
explore
the
new
country
each
of
the
five
great
bird
families
send
out
a
scout
said
the
old
and
wise
birds
learn
if
there
is
room
for
us
all
up
there
food
and
hiding
places
five
intelligent
and
capable
birds
were
immediately
appointed
by
the
five
great
bird
families
the
forest
birds
selected
a
grouse
the
field
birds
a
lark
the
sea
birds
a
gull
the
birds
a
loon
and
the
cliff
birds
a
snow
sparrow
when
the
five
chosen
ones
were
ready
to
start
the
grouse
who
was
the
largest
and
most
commanding
said
are
great
stretches
of
land
ahead
if
we
travel
together
it
will
be
long
before
we
cover
all
the
territory
that
we
must
explore
if
on
the
other
hand
we
travel
singly
each
one
exploring
his
special
portion
of
the
country
the
whole
business
can
be
accomplished
in
a
few
days
the
other
scouts
thought
the
suggestion
a
good
one
and
agreed
to
act
upon
it
it
was
decided
that
the
grouse
should
explore
the
midlands
the
lark
was
to
travel
to
the
eastward
the
sea
gull
still
farther
east
where
the
land
bordered
on
the
sea
while
the
loon
should
fly
over
the
territory
west
of
the
midlands
and
the
snow
sparrow
to
the
extreme
west
in
accordance
with
this
plan
the
five
birds
flew
over
the
whole
northland
then
they
turned
back
and
told
the
assembly
of
birds
what
they
had
discovered
the
gull
who
had
travelled
along
the
spoke
first
north
is
a
fine
country
he
said
sounds
are
full
of
fish
and
there
are
points
and
islands
without
number
most
of
these
are
uninhabited
and
the
birds
will
find
plenty
of
room
there
the
humans
do
a
little
fishing
and
sailing
in
the
sounds
but
not
enough
to
disturb
the
birds
if
the
sea
birds
follow
my
advice
they
will
move
north
immediately
when
the
gull
had
finished
the
lark
who
had
explored
the
land
back
from
the
coast
spoke
do
know
what
the
gull
means
by
his
islands
and
points
said
the
lark
i
have
travelled
only
over
great
fields
and
flowery
meadows
i
have
never
before
seen
a
country
crossed
by
some
large
streams
their
shores
are
dotted
with
homesteads
and
at
the
mouth
of
the
rivers
are
cities
but
for
the
most
part
the
country
is
very
desolate
if
the
field
birds
follow
my
advice
they
will
move
north
immediately
after
the
lark
came
the
grouse
who
had
flown
over
the
midlands
know
neither
what
the
lark
means
with
his
meadows
nor
the
gull
with
his
islands
and
points
said
he
have
seen
only
pine
forests
on
this
whole
trip
there
are
also
many
rushing
streams
and
great
stretches
of
swamp
land
but
all
that
is
not
river
or
swamp
is
forest
if
the
forest
birds
follow
my
advice
they
will
move
north
immediately
after
the
grouse
came
the
loon
who
had
explored
the
borderland
to
the
west
i
do
know
what
the
grouse
means
by
his
forests
nor
do
i
know
where
the
eyes
of
the
lark
and
the
gull
could
have
been
remarked
the
loon
there
hardly
any
land
up
there
only
big
lakes
between
beautiful
shores
glisten
clear
blue
mountain
lakes
which
pour
into
roaring
if
the
birds
follow
my
advice
they
will
move
north
immediately
the
last
speaker
was
the
snow
sparrow
who
had
flown
along
the
western
boundary
do
know
what
the
loon
means
by
his
lakes
nor
do
i
know
what
countries
the
grouse
the
lark
and
the
gull
can
have
seen
he
said
found
one
vast
mountainous
region
up
north
i
did
run
across
any
fields
or
any
pine
forests
but
peak
after
peak
and
highlands
i
have
seen
ice
fields
and
snow
and
mountain
brooks
with
water
as
white
as
milk
no
farmers
nor
cattle
nor
homesteads
have
i
seen
but
only
lapps
and
reindeer
and
huts
met
my
eyes
if
the
cliff
birds
follow
my
advice
they
will
move
north
immediately
when
the
five
scouts
had
presented
their
reports
to
the
assembly
they
began
to
call
one
another
liars
and
were
ready
to
fly
at
each
other
to
prove
the
truth
of
their
arguments
but
the
old
and
wise
birds
who
had
sent
them
out
listened
to
their
accounts
with
joy
and
calmed
their
fighting
propensities
must
quarrel
among
yourselves
they
said
understand
from
your
reports
that
up
north
there
are
large
mountain
tracts
a
big
lake
region
great
forest
lands
a
wide
plain
and
a
big
group
of
islands
this
is
more
than
we
have
expected
more
than
many
a
mighty
kingdom
can
boast
within
its
borders
the
moving
landscape
june
the
boy
had
been
reminded
of
the
old
laplander
story
because
he
himself
was
now
travelling
over
the
country
of
which
he
had
spoken
the
eagle
told
him
that
the
expanse
of
coast
which
spread
beneath
them
was
westbottom
and
that
the
blue
ridges
far
to
the
west
were
in
lapland
only
to
be
once
more
seated
comfortably
on
gorgo
back
after
all
that
he
had
suffered
during
the
forest
fire
was
a
pleasure
besides
they
were
having
a
fine
trip
the
flight
was
so
easy
that
at
times
it
seemed
as
if
they
were
standing
still
in
the
air
the
eagle
beat
and
beat
his
wings
without
appearing
to
move
from
the
spot
on
the
other
hand
everything
under
them
seemed
in
motion
the
whole
earth
and
all
things
on
it
moved
slowly
southward
the
forests
the
fields
the
fences
the
rivers
the
cities
the
islands
the
sawmills
all
were
on
the
march
the
boy
wondered
whither
they
were
bound
had
they
grown
tired
of
standing
so
far
north
and
wished
to
move
toward
the
south
amid
all
the
objects
in
motion
there
was
only
one
that
stood
still
that
was
a
railway
train
it
stood
directly
under
them
for
it
was
with
the
train
as
with
gorgo
it
could
not
move
from
the
spot
the
locomotive
sent
forth
smoke
and
sparks
the
clatter
of
the
wheels
could
be
heard
all
the
way
up
to
the
boy
but
the
train
did
not
seem
to
move
the
forests
rushed
by
the
flag
station
rushed
by
fences
and
telegraph
poles
rushed
by
but
the
train
stood
still
a
broad
river
with
a
long
bridge
came
toward
it
but
the
river
and
the
bridge
glided
along
under
the
train
with
perfect
ease
finally
a
railway
station
appeared
the
station
master
stood
on
the
platform
with
his
red
flag
and
moved
slowly
toward
the
train
when
he
waved
his
little
flag
the
locomotive
belched
even
darker
smoke
curls
than
before
and
whistled
mournfully
because
it
had
to
stand
still
all
of
a
sudden
it
began
to
move
toward
the
south
like
everything
else
the
boy
saw
all
the
coach
doors
open
and
the
passengers
step
out
while
both
cars
and
people
were
moving
southward
he
glanced
away
from
the
earth
and
tried
to
look
straight
ahead
staring
at
the
queer
railway
train
had
made
him
dizzy
but
after
he
had
gazed
for
a
moment
at
a
little
white
cloud
he
was
tired
of
that
and
looked
down
again
thinking
all
the
while
that
the
eagle
and
himself
were
quite
still
and
that
everything
else
was
travelling
on
south
fancy
suppose
the
grain
field
just
then
running
along
under
him
which
must
have
been
newly
sown
for
he
had
seen
a
green
blade
on
it
were
to
travel
all
the
way
down
to
skåne
where
the
rye
was
in
full
bloom
at
this
season
up
here
the
pine
forests
were
different
the
trees
were
bare
the
branches
short
and
the
needles
were
almost
black
many
trees
were
bald
at
the
top
and
looked
sickly
if
a
forest
like
that
were
to
journey
down
to
kolmården
and
see
a
real
forest
how
inferior
it
would
feel
the
gardens
which
he
now
saw
had
some
pretty
bushes
but
no
fruit
trees
or
lindens
or
chestnut
trees
only
mountain
ash
and
birch
there
were
some
vegetable
beds
but
they
were
not
as
yet
hoed
or
planted
if
such
an
apology
for
a
garden
were
to
come
trailing
into
sörmland
the
province
of
gardens
would
it
think
itself
a
poor
wilderness
by
comparison
imagine
an
immense
plain
like
the
one
now
gliding
beneath
him
coming
under
the
very
eyes
of
the
poor
småland
peasants
they
would
hurry
away
from
their
meagre
garden
plots
and
stony
fields
to
begin
plowing
and
sowing
there
was
one
thing
however
of
which
this
northland
had
more
than
other
lands
and
that
was
light
night
must
have
set
in
for
the
cranes
stood
sleeping
on
the
morass
but
it
was
as
light
as
day
the
sun
had
not
travelled
southward
like
every
other
thing
instead
it
had
gone
so
far
north
that
it
shone
in
the
boy
face
to
all
appearance
it
had
no
notion
of
setting
that
night
if
this
light
and
this
sun
were
only
shining
on
west
vemmenhög
it
would
suit
the
boy
father
and
mother
to
a
dot
to
have
a
working
day
that
lasted
hours
june
the
boy
raised
his
head
and
looked
around
perfectly
bewildered
it
was
mighty
queer
here
he
lay
sleeping
in
some
place
where
he
had
not
been
before
no
he
had
never
seen
this
glen
nor
the
mountains
round
about
and
never
had
he
noticed
such
puny
and
shrunken
birches
as
those
under
which
he
now
lay
where
was
the
eagle
the
boy
could
see
no
sign
of
him
gorgo
must
have
deserted
him
well
here
was
another
adventure
the
boy
lay
down
again
closed
his
eyes
and
tried
to
recall
the
circumstances
under
which
he
had
dropped
to
sleep
he
remembered
that
as
long
as
he
was
travelling
over
westbottom
he
had
fancied
that
the
eagle
and
he
were
at
a
standstill
in
the
air
and
that
the
land
under
them
was
moving
southward
as
the
eagle
turned
northwest
the
wind
had
come
from
that
side
and
again
he
had
felt
a
current
of
air
so
that
the
land
below
had
stopped
moving
and
he
had
noticed
that
the
eagle
was
bearing
him
onward
with
terrific
speed
now
we
are
flying
into
lapland
gorgo
had
said
and
the
boy
had
bent
forward
so
that
he
might
see
the
country
of
which
he
had
heard
so
much
but
he
had
felt
rather
disappointed
at
not
seeing
anything
but
great
tracts
of
forest
land
and
wide
marshes
forest
followed
marsh
and
marsh
followed
forest
the
monotony
of
the
whole
finally
made
him
so
sleepy
that
he
had
nearly
dropped
to
the
ground
he
said
to
the
eagle
that
he
could
not
stay
on
his
back
another
minute
but
must
sleep
awhile
gorgo
had
promptly
swooped
to
the
ground
where
the
boy
had
dropped
down
on
a
moss
tuft
then
gorgo
put
a
talon
around
him
and
soared
into
the
air
with
him
again
go
to
sleep
thumbietot
he
cried
the
sunshine
keeps
me
awake
and
i
want
to
continue
the
journey
although
the
boy
hung
in
this
uncomfortable
position
he
actually
dozed
and
dreamed
he
dreamed
that
he
was
on
a
broad
road
in
southern
sweden
hurrying
along
as
fast
as
his
little
legs
could
carry
him
he
was
not
alone
many
wayfarers
were
tramping
in
the
same
direction
close
beside
him
marched
rye
blades
blossoming
corn
flowers
and
yellow
daisies
heavily
laden
apple
trees
went
puffing
along
followed
by
bean
stalks
big
clusters
of
white
daisies
and
masses
of
berry
bushes
tall
beeches
and
oaks
and
lindens
strolled
leisurely
in
the
middle
of
the
road
their
branches
swaying
and
they
stepped
aside
for
none
between
the
boy
tiny
feet
darted
the
little
flowers
wild
strawberry
blossoms
white
anemones
clover
and
at
first
he
thought
that
only
the
vegetable
family
was
on
the
march
but
presently
he
saw
that
animals
and
people
accompanied
them
the
insects
were
buzzing
around
advancing
bushes
the
fishes
were
swimming
in
moving
ditches
the
birds
were
singing
in
strolling
trees
both
tame
and
wild
beasts
were
racing
and
amongst
all
this
people
moved
along
some
with
spades
and
scythes
others
with
axes
and
others
again
with
fishing
nets
the
procession
marched
with
gladness
and
gayety
and
he
did
not
wonder
at
that
when
he
saw
who
was
leading
it
it
was
nothing
less
than
the
sun
itself
that
rolled
on
like
a
great
shining
head
with
hair
of
rays
and
a
countenance
beaming
with
merriment
and
kindliness
forward
march
it
kept
calling
out
none
need
feel
anxious
whilst
i
am
here
forward
march
i
wonder
where
the
sun
wants
to
take
us
to
remarked
the
boy
a
rye
blade
that
walked
beside
him
heard
him
and
immediately
answered
he
wants
to
take
us
up
to
lapland
to
fight
the
ice
witch
presently
the
boy
noticed
that
some
of
the
travellers
hesitated
slowed
up
and
finally
stood
quite
still
he
saw
that
the
tall
beech
tree
stopped
and
that
the
roebuck
and
the
wheat
blade
tarried
by
the
wayside
likewise
the
blackberry
bush
the
little
yellow
buttercup
the
chestnut
tree
and
the
grouse
he
glanced
about
him
and
tried
to
reason
out
why
so
many
stopped
then
he
discovered
that
they
were
no
longer
in
southern
sweden
the
march
had
been
so
rapid
that
they
were
already
in
svealand
up
there
the
oak
began
to
move
more
cautiously
it
paused
awhile
to
consider
took
a
few
faltering
steps
then
came
to
a
standstill
why
does
the
oak
come
along
asked
the
boy
it
afraid
of
the
ice
witch
said
a
fair
young
birch
that
tripped
along
so
boldly
and
cheerfully
that
it
was
a
joy
to
watch
it
the
crowd
hurried
on
as
before
in
a
short
time
they
were
in
norrland
and
now
it
mattered
not
how
much
the
sun
cried
and
coaxed
the
apple
tree
stopped
the
cherry
tree
stopped
the
rye
blade
stopped
the
boy
turned
to
them
and
asked
why
do
you
come
along
why
do
you
desert
the
sun
we
dare
not
we
afraid
of
the
ice
witch
who
lives
in
lapland
they
answered
the
boy
comprehended
that
they
were
far
north
as
the
procession
grew
thinner
and
thinner
the
rye
blade
the
barley
the
wild
strawberry
the
blueberry
bush
the
pea
stalk
the
currant
bush
had
come
along
as
far
as
this
the
elk
and
the
domestic
cow
had
been
walking
side
by
side
but
now
they
stopped
the
sun
no
doubt
would
have
been
almost
deserted
if
new
followers
had
not
happened
along
osier
bushes
and
a
lot
of
brushy
vegetation
joined
the
procession
laps
and
reindeer
mountain
owl
and
mountain
fox
and
willow
grouse
followed
then
the
boy
heard
something
coming
toward
them
he
saw
great
rivers
and
creeks
sweeping
along
with
terrible
force
why
are
they
in
such
a
hurry
he
asked
they
are
running
away
from
the
ice
witch
who
lives
up
in
the
mountains
all
of
a
sudden
the
boy
saw
before
him
a
high
dark
turreted
wall
instantly
the
sun
turned
its
beaming
face
toward
this
wall
and
flooded
it
with
light
then
it
became
apparent
that
it
was
no
wall
but
the
most
glorious
mountains
which
loomed
up
one
behind
another
their
peaks
were
in
the
sunlight
their
slopes
azure
and
onward
onward
urged
the
sun
as
it
climbed
the
steep
cliffs
no
danger
so
long
as
i
am
with
you
but
half
way
up
the
bold
young
birch
deserted
also
the
sturdy
pine
and
the
persistent
spruce
and
there
too
the
laplander
and
the
willow
brush
deserted
at
last
when
the
sun
reached
the
top
there
was
no
one
but
the
little
tot
nils
holgersson
who
had
followed
it
the
sun
rolled
into
a
cave
where
the
walls
were
bedecked
with
ice
and
nils
holgersson
wanted
to
follow
but
farther
than
the
opening
of
the
cave
he
dared
not
venture
for
in
there
he
saw
something
dreadful
far
back
in
the
cave
sat
an
old
witch
with
an
ice
body
hair
of
icicles
and
a
mantle
of
snow
at
her
feet
lay
three
black
wolves
who
rose
and
opened
their
jaws
when
the
sun
approached
from
the
mouth
of
one
came
a
piercing
cold
from
the
second
a
blustering
north
wind
and
from
the
third
came
impenetrable
darkness
that
must
be
the
ice
witch
and
her
tribe
thought
the
boy
he
understood
that
now
was
the
time
for
him
to
flee
but
he
was
so
curious
to
see
the
outcome
of
the
meeting
between
the
sun
and
the
ice
witch
that
he
tarried
the
ice
witch
did
not
move
only
turned
her
hideous
face
toward
the
sun
this
continued
for
a
short
time
it
appeared
to
the
boy
that
the
witch
was
beginning
to
sigh
and
tremble
her
snow
mantle
fell
and
the
three
ferocious
wolves
howled
less
savagely
suddenly
the
sun
cried
now
my
time
is
up
and
rolled
out
of
the
cave
then
the
ice
witch
let
loose
her
three
wolves
instantly
the
north
wind
cold
and
darkness
rushed
from
the
cave
and
began
to
chase
the
sun
drive
him
out
drive
him
back
shrieked
the
ice
witch
chase
him
so
far
that
he
can
never
come
back
teach
him
that
lapland
is
mine
but
nils
holgersson
felt
so
unhappy
when
he
saw
that
the
sun
was
to
be
driven
from
lapland
that
he
awakened
with
a
cry
when
he
recovered
his
senses
he
found
himself
at
the
bottom
of
a
ravine
but
where
was
gorgo
how
was
he
to
find
out
where
he
himself
was
he
arose
and
looked
all
around
him
then
he
happened
to
glance
upward
and
saw
a
peculiar
structure
of
pine
twigs
and
branches
that
stood
on
a
that
must
be
one
of
those
eagle
nests
that
gorgo
but
this
was
as
far
as
he
got
he
tore
off
his
cap
waved
it
in
the
air
and
cheered
now
he
understood
where
gorgo
had
brought
him
this
was
the
very
glen
where
the
wild
geese
lived
in
summer
and
just
above
it
was
the
cliff
he
had
arrived
he
would
meet
morten
and
akka
and
all
the
other
comrades
in
a
few
moments
hurrah
the
meeting
all
was
still
in
the
glen
the
sun
had
not
yet
stepped
above
the
cliffs
and
nils
holgersson
knew
that
it
was
too
early
in
the
morning
for
the
geese
to
be
awake
the
boy
walked
along
leisurely
and
searched
for
his
friends
before
he
had
gone
very
far
he
paused
with
a
smile
for
he
saw
such
a
pretty
sight
a
wild
goose
was
sleeping
in
a
neat
little
nest
and
beside
her
stood
her
he
too
slept
but
it
was
obvious
that
he
had
stationed
himself
thus
near
her
that
he
might
be
on
hand
in
the
possible
event
of
danger
the
boy
went
on
without
disturbing
them
and
peeped
into
the
willow
brush
that
covered
the
ground
it
was
not
long
before
he
spied
another
goose
couple
these
were
strangers
not
of
his
flock
but
he
was
so
happy
that
he
began
to
hum
just
because
he
had
come
across
wild
geese
he
peeped
into
another
bit
of
brushwood
there
at
last
he
saw
two
that
were
familiar
it
was
certainly
neljä
that
was
nesting
there
and
the
who
stood
beside
her
was
surely
kolme
why
of
course
the
boy
had
a
good
mind
to
awaken
them
but
he
let
them
sleep
on
and
walked
away
in
the
next
brush
he
saw
viisi
and
kuusi
and
not
far
from
them
he
found
yksi
and
kaksi
all
four
were
asleep
and
the
boy
passed
by
without
disturbing
them
as
he
approached
the
next
brush
he
thought
he
saw
something
white
shimmering
among
the
bushes
and
the
heart
of
him
thumped
with
joy
yes
it
was
as
he
expected
in
there
sat
the
dainty
dunfin
on
an
nest
beside
her
stood
her
white
although
he
slept
it
was
easy
to
see
how
proud
he
was
to
watch
over
his
wife
up
here
among
the
lapland
mountains
the
boy
did
not
care
to
waken
the
so
he
walked
on
he
had
to
seek
a
long
time
before
he
came
across
any
more
wild
geese
finally
he
saw
on
a
little
hillock
something
that
resembled
a
small
gray
moss
tuft
and
he
knew
that
there
was
akka
from
kebnekaise
she
stood
wide
awake
looking
about
as
if
she
were
keeping
watch
over
the
whole
glen
good
morning
mother
akka
said
the
boy
please
do
waken
the
other
geese
yet
awhile
for
i
wish
to
speak
with
you
in
private
the
old
came
rushing
down
the
hill
and
up
to
the
boy
first
she
seized
hold
of
him
and
shook
him
then
she
stroked
him
with
her
bill
before
she
shook
him
again
but
she
did
not
say
a
word
since
he
asked
her
not
to
waken
the
others
thumbietot
kissed
old
mother
akka
on
both
cheeks
then
he
told
her
how
he
had
been
carried
off
to
skansen
and
held
captive
there
now
i
must
tell
you
that
smirre
fox
short
of
an
ear
sat
imprisoned
in
the
foxes
cage
at
skansen
said
the
boy
although
he
was
very
mean
to
us
i
could
help
feeling
sorry
for
him
there
were
many
other
foxes
in
the
cage
and
they
seemed
quite
contented
there
but
smirre
sat
all
the
while
looking
dejected
longing
for
liberty
i
made
many
good
friends
at
skansen
and
i
learned
one
day
from
the
lapp
dog
that
a
man
had
come
to
skansen
to
buy
foxes
he
was
from
some
island
far
out
in
the
ocean
all
the
foxes
had
been
exterminated
there
and
the
rats
were
about
to
get
the
better
of
the
inhabitants
so
they
wished
the
foxes
back
again
as
soon
as
i
learned
of
this
i
went
to
smirre
cage
and
said
to
him
some
men
are
coming
here
to
get
a
pair
of
foxes
do
hide
smirre
but
keep
well
in
the
foreground
and
see
to
it
that
you
are
chosen
then
you
be
free
again
he
followed
my
suggestion
and
now
he
is
running
at
large
on
the
island
what
say
you
to
this
mother
akka
if
you
had
been
in
my
place
would
you
not
have
done
likewise
you
have
acted
in
a
way
that
makes
me
wish
i
had
done
that
myself
said
the
proudly
it
a
relief
to
know
that
you
approve
said
the
boy
now
there
is
one
thing
more
i
wish
to
ask
you
about
one
day
i
happened
to
see
gorgo
the
eagle
the
one
that
fought
with
morten
a
prisoner
at
skansen
he
was
in
the
eagles
cage
and
looked
pitifully
forlorn
i
was
thinking
of
filing
down
the
wire
roof
over
him
and
letting
him
out
but
i
also
thought
of
his
being
a
dangerous
robber
and
and
wondered
if
i
should
be
doing
right
in
letting
loose
such
a
plunderer
and
if
it
were
not
better
perhaps
to
let
him
stay
where
he
was
what
say
you
mother
akka
was
it
right
to
think
thus
no
it
was
not
right
retorted
akka
say
what
you
will
about
the
eagles
they
are
proud
birds
and
greater
lovers
of
freedom
than
all
others
it
is
not
right
to
keep
them
in
captivity
do
you
know
what
i
would
suggest
this
that
as
soon
as
you
are
well
rested
we
two
make
the
trip
together
to
the
big
bird
prison
and
liberate
gorgo
that
is
just
the
word
i
was
expecting
from
you
mother
akka
returned
the
boy
eagerly
there
are
those
who
say
that
you
no
longer
have
any
love
in
your
heart
for
the
one
you
reared
so
tenderly
because
he
lives
as
eagles
must
live
but
i
know
now
that
it
is
true
and
now
i
want
to
see
if
morten
is
awake
meanwhile
if
you
wish
to
say
a
you
to
the
one
who
brought
me
here
to
you
i
think
you
find
him
up
there
on
the
cliff
ledge
where
once
you
found
a
helpless
eaglet
osa
the
goose
girl
and
little
mats
the
year
that
nils
holgersson
travelled
with
the
wild
geese
everybody
was
talking
about
two
little
children
a
boy
and
a
girl
who
tramped
through
the
country
they
were
from
sunnerbo
township
in
småland
and
had
once
lived
with
their
parents
and
four
brothers
and
sisters
in
a
little
cabin
on
the
heath
while
the
two
children
osa
and
mats
were
still
small
a
poor
homeless
woman
came
to
their
cabin
one
night
and
begged
for
shelter
although
the
place
could
hardly
hold
the
family
she
was
taken
in
and
the
mother
spread
a
bed
for
her
on
the
floor
in
the
night
she
coughed
so
hard
that
the
children
fancied
the
house
shook
by
morning
she
was
too
ill
to
continue
her
wanderings
the
children
father
and
mother
were
as
kind
to
her
as
could
be
they
gave
up
their
bed
to
her
and
slept
on
the
floor
while
the
father
went
to
the
doctor
and
brought
her
medicine
the
first
few
days
the
sick
woman
behaved
like
a
savage
she
demanded
constant
attention
and
never
uttered
a
word
of
thanks
later
she
became
more
subdued
and
finally
begged
to
be
carried
out
to
the
heath
and
left
there
to
die
when
her
hosts
would
not
hear
of
this
she
told
them
that
the
last
few
years
she
had
roamed
about
with
a
band
of
gipsies
she
herself
was
not
of
gipsy
blood
but
was
the
daughter
of
a
farmer
she
had
run
away
from
home
and
gone
with
the
nomads
she
believed
that
a
gipsy
woman
who
was
angry
at
her
had
brought
this
sickness
upon
her
nor
was
that
all
the
gipsy
woman
had
also
cursed
her
saying
that
all
who
took
her
under
their
roof
or
were
kind
to
her
should
suffer
a
like
fate
she
believed
this
and
therefore
begged
them
to
cast
her
out
of
the
house
and
never
to
see
her
again
she
did
not
want
to
bring
misfortune
down
upon
such
good
people
but
the
peasants
refused
to
do
her
bidding
it
was
quite
possible
that
they
were
alarmed
but
they
were
not
the
kind
of
folk
who
could
turn
out
a
poor
sick
person
soon
after
that
she
died
and
then
along
came
the
misfortunes
before
there
had
never
been
anything
but
happiness
in
that
cabin
its
inmates
were
poor
yet
not
so
very
poor
the
father
was
a
maker
of
combs
and
mother
and
children
helped
him
with
the
work
father
made
the
frames
mother
and
the
older
children
did
the
binding
while
the
smaller
ones
planed
the
teeth
and
cut
them
out
they
worked
from
morning
until
night
but
the
time
passed
pleasantly
especially
when
father
talked
of
the
days
when
he
travelled
about
in
foreign
lands
and
sold
combs
father
was
so
jolly
that
sometimes
mother
and
the
children
would
laugh
until
their
sides
ached
at
his
funny
quips
and
jokes
the
weeks
following
the
death
of
the
poor
vagabond
woman
lingered
in
the
minds
of
the
children
like
a
horrible
nightmare
they
knew
not
if
the
time
had
been
long
or
short
but
they
remembered
that
they
were
always
having
funerals
at
home
one
after
another
they
lost
their
brothers
and
sisters
at
last
it
was
very
still
and
sad
in
the
cabin
the
mother
kept
up
some
measure
of
courage
but
the
father
was
not
a
bit
like
himself
he
could
no
longer
work
nor
jest
but
sat
from
morning
till
night
his
head
buried
in
his
hands
and
only
brooded
once
that
was
after
the
third
burial
the
father
had
broken
out
into
wild
talk
which
frightened
the
children
he
said
that
he
could
not
understand
why
such
misfortunes
should
come
upon
them
they
had
done
a
kindly
thing
in
helping
the
sick
woman
could
it
be
true
then
that
the
evil
in
this
world
was
more
powerful
than
the
good
the
mother
tried
to
reason
with
him
but
she
was
unable
to
soothe
him
a
few
days
later
the
eldest
was
stricken
she
had
always
been
the
father
favourite
so
when
he
realized
that
she
too
must
go
he
fled
from
all
the
misery
the
mother
never
said
anything
but
she
thought
it
was
best
for
him
to
be
away
as
she
feared
that
he
might
lose
his
reason
he
had
brooded
too
long
over
this
one
idea
that
god
had
allowed
a
wicked
person
to
bring
about
so
much
evil
after
the
father
went
away
they
became
very
poor
for
awhile
he
sent
them
money
but
afterward
things
must
have
gone
badly
with
him
for
no
more
came
the
day
of
the
eldest
daughter
burial
the
mother
closed
the
cabin
and
left
home
with
the
two
remaining
children
osa
and
mats
she
went
down
to
skåne
to
work
in
the
beet
fields
and
found
a
place
at
the
jordberga
sugar
refinery
she
was
a
good
worker
and
had
a
cheerful
and
generous
nature
everybody
liked
her
many
were
astonished
because
she
could
be
so
calm
after
all
that
she
had
passed
through
but
the
mother
was
very
strong
and
patient
when
any
one
spoke
to
her
of
her
two
sturdy
children
she
only
said
i
shall
soon
lose
them
also
without
a
quaver
in
her
voice
or
a
tear
in
her
eye
she
had
accustomed
herself
to
expect
nothing
else
but
it
did
not
turn
out
as
she
feared
instead
the
sickness
came
upon
herself
she
had
gone
to
skane
in
the
beginning
of
summer
before
autumn
she
was
gone
and
the
children
were
left
alone
while
their
mother
was
ill
she
had
often
said
to
the
children
they
must
remember
that
she
never
regretted
having
let
the
sick
woman
stop
with
them
it
was
not
hard
to
die
when
one
had
done
right
she
said
for
then
one
could
go
with
a
clear
conscience
before
the
mother
passed
away
she
tried
to
make
some
provision
for
her
children
she
asked
the
people
with
whom
she
lived
to
let
them
remain
in
the
room
which
she
had
occupied
if
the
children
only
had
a
shelter
they
would
not
become
a
burden
to
any
one
she
knew
that
they
could
take
care
of
themselves
osa
and
mats
were
allowed
to
keep
the
room
on
condition
that
they
would
tend
the
geese
as
it
was
always
hard
to
find
children
willing
to
do
that
work
it
turned
out
as
the
mother
expected
they
did
maintain
themselves
the
girl
made
candy
and
the
boy
carved
wooden
toys
which
they
sold
at
the
farm
houses
they
had
a
talent
for
trading
and
soon
began
buying
eggs
and
butter
from
the
farmers
which
they
sold
to
the
workers
at
the
sugar
refinery
osa
was
the
older
and
by
the
time
she
was
thirteen
she
was
as
responsible
as
a
grown
woman
she
was
quiet
and
serious
while
mats
was
lively
and
talkative
his
sister
used
to
say
to
him
that
he
could
outcackle
the
geese
when
the
children
had
been
at
jordberga
for
two
years
there
was
a
lecture
given
one
evening
at
the
schoolhouse
evidently
it
was
meant
for
but
the
two
småland
children
were
in
the
audience
they
did
not
regard
themselves
as
children
and
few
persons
thought
of
them
as
such
the
lecturer
talked
about
the
dread
disease
called
the
white
plague
which
every
year
carried
off
so
many
people
in
sweden
he
spoke
very
plainly
and
the
children
understood
every
word
after
the
lecture
they
waited
outside
the
schoolhouse
when
the
lecturer
came
out
they
took
hold
of
hands
and
walked
gravely
up
to
him
asking
if
they
might
speak
to
him
the
stranger
must
have
wondered
at
the
two
rosy
children
standing
there
talking
with
an
earnestness
more
in
keeping
with
people
thrice
their
age
but
he
listened
graciously
to
them
they
related
what
had
happened
in
their
home
and
asked
the
lecturer
if
he
thought
their
mother
and
their
sisters
and
brothers
had
died
of
the
sickness
he
had
described
very
likely
he
answered
it
could
hardly
have
been
any
other
disease
if
only
the
mother
and
father
had
known
what
the
children
learned
that
evening
they
might
have
protected
themselves
if
they
had
burned
the
clothing
of
the
vagabond
woman
if
they
had
scoured
and
aired
the
cabin
and
had
not
used
the
old
bedding
all
whom
the
children
mourned
might
have
been
living
yet
the
lecturer
said
he
could
not
say
positively
but
he
believed
that
none
of
their
dear
ones
would
have
been
sick
had
they
understood
how
to
guard
against
the
infection
osa
and
mats
waited
awhile
before
putting
the
next
question
for
that
was
the
most
important
of
all
it
was
not
true
then
that
the
gipsy
woman
had
sent
the
sickness
because
they
had
befriended
the
one
with
whom
she
was
angry
it
was
not
something
special
that
had
stricken
only
them
the
lecturer
assured
them
that
no
person
had
the
power
to
bring
sickness
upon
another
in
that
way
thereupon
the
children
thanked
him
and
went
to
their
room
they
talked
until
late
that
night
the
next
day
they
gave
notice
that
they
could
not
tend
geese
another
year
but
must
go
elsewhere
where
were
they
going
why
to
try
to
find
their
father
they
must
tell
him
that
their
mother
and
the
other
children
had
died
of
a
common
ailment
and
not
something
special
brought
upon
them
by
an
angry
person
they
were
very
glad
that
they
had
found
out
about
this
now
it
was
their
duty
to
tell
their
father
of
it
for
probably
he
was
still
trying
to
solve
the
mystery
osa
and
mats
set
out
for
their
old
home
on
the
heath
when
they
arrived
they
were
shocked
to
find
the
little
cabin
in
flames
they
went
to
the
parsonage
and
there
they
learned
that
a
railroad
workman
had
seen
their
father
at
malmberget
far
up
in
lapland
he
had
been
working
in
a
mine
and
possibly
was
still
there
when
the
clergyman
heard
that
the
children
wanted
to
go
in
search
of
their
father
he
brought
forth
a
map
and
showed
them
how
far
it
was
to
malmberget
and
tried
to
dissuade
them
from
making
the
journey
but
the
children
insisted
that
they
must
find
their
father
he
had
left
home
believing
something
that
was
not
true
they
must
find
him
and
tell
him
that
it
was
all
a
mistake
they
did
not
want
to
spend
their
little
savings
buying
railway
tickets
therefore
they
decided
to
go
all
the
way
on
foot
which
they
never
regretted
as
it
proved
to
be
a
remarkably
beautiful
journey
before
they
were
out
of
småland
they
stopped
at
a
farm
house
to
buy
food
the
housewife
was
a
kind
motherly
soul
who
took
an
interest
in
the
children
she
asked
them
who
they
were
and
where
they
came
from
and
they
told
her
their
story
dear
dear
dear
dear
she
interpolated
time
and
again
when
they
were
speaking
later
she
petted
the
children
and
stuffed
them
with
all
kinds
of
goodies
for
which
she
would
not
accept
a
penny
when
they
rose
to
thank
her
and
go
the
woman
asked
them
to
stop
at
her
brother
farm
in
the
next
township
of
course
the
children
were
delighted
give
him
my
greetings
and
tell
him
what
has
happened
to
you
said
the
peasant
woman
this
the
children
did
and
were
well
treated
from
every
farm
after
that
it
was
always
if
you
happen
to
go
in
such
and
such
a
direction
stop
there
or
there
and
tell
them
what
has
happened
to
you
in
every
farm
house
to
which
they
were
sent
there
was
always
a
consumptive
so
osa
and
mats
went
through
the
country
unconsciously
teaching
the
people
how
to
combat
that
dreadful
disease
long
long
ago
when
the
black
plague
was
ravaging
the
country
was
said
that
a
boy
and
a
girl
were
seen
wandering
from
house
to
house
the
boy
carried
a
rake
and
if
he
stopped
and
raked
in
front
of
a
house
it
meant
that
there
many
should
die
but
not
all
for
the
rake
has
coarse
teeth
and
does
not
take
everything
with
it
the
girl
carried
a
broom
and
if
she
came
along
and
swept
before
a
door
it
meant
that
all
who
lived
within
must
die
for
the
broom
is
an
implement
that
makes
a
clean
sweep
it
seems
quite
remarkable
that
in
our
time
two
children
should
wander
through
the
land
because
of
a
cruel
sickness
but
these
children
did
not
frighten
people
with
the
rake
and
the
broom
they
said
rather
we
will
not
content
ourselves
with
merely
raking
the
yard
and
sweeping
the
floors
we
will
use
mop
and
brush
water
and
soap
we
will
keep
clean
inside
and
outside
of
the
door
and
we
ourselves
will
be
clean
in
both
mind
and
body
in
this
way
we
will
conquer
the
sickness
one
day
while
still
in
lapland
akka
took
the
boy
to
malmberget
where
they
discovered
little
mats
lying
unconscious
at
the
mouth
of
the
pit
he
and
osa
had
arrived
there
a
short
time
before
that
morning
he
had
been
roaming
about
hoping
to
come
across
his
father
he
had
ventured
too
near
the
shaft
and
been
hurt
by
flying
rocks
after
the
setting
off
of
a
blast
thumbietot
ran
to
the
edge
of
the
shaft
and
called
down
to
the
miners
that
a
little
boy
was
injured
immediately
a
number
of
labourers
came
rushing
up
to
little
mats
two
of
them
carried
him
to
the
hut
where
he
and
osa
were
staying
they
did
all
they
could
to
save
him
but
it
was
too
late
thumbietot
felt
so
sorry
for
poor
osa
he
wanted
to
help
and
comfort
her
but
he
knew
that
if
he
were
to
go
to
her
now
he
would
only
frighten
her
such
as
he
was
the
night
after
the
burial
of
little
mats
osa
straightway
shut
herself
in
her
hut
she
sat
alone
recalling
one
after
another
things
her
brother
had
said
and
done
there
was
so
much
to
think
about
that
she
did
not
go
straight
to
bed
but
sat
up
most
of
the
night
the
more
she
thought
of
her
brother
the
more
she
realized
how
hard
it
would
be
to
live
without
him
at
last
she
dropped
her
head
on
the
table
and
wept
what
shall
i
do
now
that
little
mats
is
gone
she
sobbed
it
was
far
along
toward
morning
and
osa
spent
by
the
strain
of
her
hard
day
finally
fell
asleep
she
dreamed
that
little
mats
softly
opened
the
door
and
stepped
into
the
room
osa
you
must
go
and
find
father
he
said
how
can
i
when
i
do
even
know
where
he
is
she
replied
in
her
dream
do
worry
about
that
returned
little
mats
in
his
usual
cheery
way
i
send
some
one
to
help
you
just
as
osa
the
goose
girl
dreamed
that
little
mats
had
said
this
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
it
was
a
real
knock
not
something
she
heard
in
the
dream
but
she
was
so
held
by
the
dream
that
she
could
not
tell
the
real
from
the
unreal
as
she
went
on
to
open
the
door
she
thought
this
must
be
the
person
little
mats
promised
to
send
me
she
was
right
for
it
was
thumbietot
come
to
talk
to
her
about
her
father
when
he
saw
that
she
was
not
afraid
of
him
he
told
her
in
a
few
words
where
her
father
was
and
how
to
reach
him
while
he
was
speaking
osa
the
goose
girl
gradually
regained
consciousness
when
he
had
finished
she
was
wide
awake
then
she
was
so
terrified
at
the
thought
of
talking
with
an
elf
that
she
could
not
say
thank
you
or
anything
else
but
quickly
shut
the
door
as
she
did
that
she
thought
she
saw
an
expression
of
pain
flash
across
the
elf
face
but
she
could
not
help
what
she
did
for
she
was
beside
herself
with
fright
she
crept
into
bed
as
quickly
as
she
could
and
drew
the
covers
over
her
head
although
she
was
afraid
of
the
elf
she
had
a
feeling
that
he
meant
well
by
her
so
the
next
day
she
made
haste
to
do
as
he
had
told
her
with
the
laplanders
one
afternoon
in
july
it
rained
frightfully
up
around
lake
luossajaure
the
laplanders
who
lived
mostly
in
the
open
during
the
summer
had
crawled
under
the
tent
and
were
squatting
round
the
fire
drinking
coffee
the
new
settlers
on
the
east
shore
of
the
lake
worked
diligently
to
have
their
homes
in
readiness
before
the
severe
arctic
winter
set
in
they
wondered
at
the
laplanders
who
had
lived
in
the
far
north
for
centuries
without
even
thinking
that
better
protection
was
needed
against
cold
and
storm
than
thin
tent
covering
the
laplanders
on
the
other
hand
wondered
at
the
new
settlers
giving
themselves
so
much
needless
hard
work
when
nothing
more
was
necessary
to
live
comfortably
than
a
few
reindeer
and
a
tent
they
only
had
to
drive
the
poles
into
the
ground
and
spread
the
covers
over
them
and
their
abodes
were
ready
they
did
not
have
to
trouble
themselves
about
decorating
or
furnishing
the
principal
thing
was
to
scatter
some
spruce
twigs
on
the
floor
spread
a
few
skins
and
hang
the
big
kettle
in
which
they
cooked
their
reindeer
meat
on
a
chain
suspended
from
the
top
of
the
tent
poles
while
the
laplanders
were
chatting
over
their
coffee
cups
a
row
boat
coming
from
the
kiruna
side
pulled
ashore
at
the
lapps
quarters
a
workman
and
a
young
girl
between
thirteen
and
fourteen
stepped
from
the
boat
the
girl
was
osa
the
lapp
dogs
bounded
down
to
them
barking
loudly
and
a
native
poked
his
head
out
of
the
tent
opening
to
see
what
was
going
on
he
was
glad
when
he
saw
the
workman
for
he
was
a
friend
of
the
laplanders
a
kindly
and
sociable
man
who
could
speak
their
native
tongue
the
lapp
called
to
him
to
crawl
under
the
tent
you
just
in
time
söderberg
he
said
the
coffee
pot
is
on
the
fire
no
one
can
do
any
work
in
this
rain
so
come
in
and
tell
us
the
news
the
workman
went
in
and
with
much
ado
and
amid
a
great
deal
of
laughter
and
joking
places
were
made
for
söderberg
and
osa
though
the
tent
was
already
crowded
to
the
limit
with
natives
osa
understood
none
of
the
conversation
she
sat
dumb
and
looked
in
wonderment
at
the
kettle
and
coffee
pot
at
the
fire
and
smoke
at
the
lapp
men
and
lapp
women
at
the
children
and
dogs
the
walls
and
floor
the
coffee
cups
and
tobacco
pipes
the
costumes
and
crude
implements
all
this
was
new
to
her
suddenly
she
lowered
her
glance
conscious
that
every
one
in
the
tent
was
looking
at
her
söderberg
must
have
said
something
about
her
for
now
both
lapp
men
and
lapp
women
took
the
short
pipes
from
their
mouths
and
stared
at
her
in
wonder
and
awe
the
laplander
at
her
side
patted
her
shoulder
and
nodded
saying
in
swedish
bra
bra
good
good
a
lapp
woman
filled
a
cup
to
the
brim
with
coffee
and
passed
it
under
difficulties
while
a
lapp
boy
who
was
about
her
own
age
wriggled
and
crawled
between
the
squatters
over
to
her
osa
felt
that
söderberg
was
telling
the
laplanders
that
she
had
just
buried
her
little
brother
mats
she
wished
he
would
find
out
about
her
father
instead
the
elf
had
said
that
he
lived
with
the
lapps
who
camped
west
of
lake
luossajaure
and
she
had
begged
leave
to
ride
up
on
a
sand
truck
to
seek
him
as
no
regular
passenger
trains
came
so
far
both
labourers
and
foremen
had
assisted
her
as
best
they
could
an
engineer
had
sent
söderberg
across
the
lake
with
her
as
he
spoke
lappish
she
had
hoped
to
meet
her
father
as
soon
as
she
arrived
her
glance
wandered
anxiously
from
face
to
face
but
she
saw
only
natives
her
father
was
not
there
she
noticed
that
the
lapps
and
the
swede
söderberg
grew
more
and
more
earnest
as
they
talked
among
themselves
the
lapps
shook
their
heads
and
tapped
their
foreheads
as
if
they
were
speaking
of
some
one
that
was
not
quite
right
in
his
mind
she
became
so
uneasy
that
she
could
no
longer
endure
the
suspense
and
asked
söderberg
what
the
laplanders
knew
of
her
father
they
say
he
has
gone
fishing
said
the
workman
they
not
sure
that
he
can
get
back
to
the
camp
but
as
soon
as
the
weather
clears
one
of
them
will
go
in
search
of
him
thereupon
he
turned
to
the
lapps
and
went
on
talking
to
them
he
did
not
wish
to
give
osa
an
opportunity
to
question
him
further
about
jon
esserson
the
next
morning
ola
serka
himself
who
was
the
most
distinguished
man
among
the
lapps
had
said
that
he
would
find
osa
father
but
he
appeared
to
be
in
no
haste
and
sat
huddled
outside
the
tent
thinking
of
jon
esserson
and
wondering
how
best
to
tell
him
of
his
daughter
arrival
it
would
require
diplomacy
in
order
that
jon
esserson
might
not
become
alarmed
and
flee
he
was
an
odd
sort
of
man
who
was
afraid
of
children
he
used
to
say
that
the
sight
of
them
made
him
so
melancholy
that
he
could
not
endure
it
while
ola
serka
deliberated
osa
the
goose
girl
and
aslak
the
young
lapp
boy
who
had
stared
so
hard
at
her
the
night
before
sat
on
the
ground
in
front
of
the
tent
and
chatted
aslak
had
been
to
school
and
could
speak
swedish
he
was
telling
osa
about
the
life
of
the
saméfolk
assuring
her
that
they
fared
better
than
other
people
osa
thought
that
they
lived
wretchedly
and
told
him
so
you
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
said
aslak
curtly
only
stop
with
us
a
week
and
you
shall
see
that
we
are
the
happiest
people
on
earth
if
i
were
to
stop
here
a
whole
week
i
should
be
choked
by
all
the
smoke
in
the
tent
osa
retorted
do
say
that
protested
the
boy
you
know
nothing
of
us
let
me
tell
you
something
which
will
make
you
understand
that
the
longer
you
stay
with
us
the
more
contented
you
will
become
thereupon
aslak
began
to
tell
osa
how
a
sickness
called
the
black
plague
once
raged
throughout
the
land
he
was
not
certain
as
to
whether
it
had
swept
through
the
real
saméland
where
they
now
were
but
in
jämtland
it
had
raged
so
brutally
that
among
the
saméfolk
who
lived
in
the
forests
and
mountains
there
all
had
died
except
a
boy
of
fifteen
among
the
swedes
who
lived
in
the
valleys
none
was
left
but
a
girl
who
was
also
fifteen
years
old
the
boy
and
girl
separately
tramped
the
desolate
country
all
winter
in
search
of
other
human
beings
finally
toward
spring
the
two
met
aslak
continued
the
swedish
girl
begged
the
lapp
boy
to
accompany
her
southward
where
she
could
meet
people
of
her
own
race
she
did
not
wish
to
tarry
longer
in
jämtland
where
there
were
only
vacant
homesteads
i
take
you
wherever
you
wish
to
go
said
the
boy
not
before
winter
it
spring
now
and
my
reindeer
go
westward
toward
the
mountains
you
know
that
we
who
are
of
the
saméfolk
must
go
where
our
reindeer
take
us
the
swedish
girl
was
the
daughter
of
wealthy
parents
she
was
used
to
living
under
a
roof
sleeping
in
a
bed
and
eating
at
a
table
she
had
always
despised
the
poor
mountaineers
and
thought
that
those
who
lived
under
the
open
sky
were
most
unfortunate
but
she
was
afraid
to
return
to
her
home
where
there
were
none
but
the
dead
least
let
me
go
with
you
to
the
mountains
she
said
to
the
boy
that
i
have
to
tramp
about
here
all
alone
and
never
hear
the
sound
of
a
human
voice
the
boy
willingly
assented
so
the
girl
went
with
the
reindeer
to
the
mountains
the
herd
yearned
for
the
good
pastures
there
and
every
day
tramped
long
distances
to
feed
on
the
moss
there
was
not
time
to
pitch
tents
the
children
had
to
lie
on
the
snowy
ground
and
sleep
when
the
reindeer
stopped
to
graze
the
girl
often
sighed
and
complained
of
being
so
tired
that
she
must
turn
back
to
the
valley
nevertheless
she
went
along
to
avoid
being
left
without
human
companionship
when
they
reached
the
highlands
the
boy
pitched
a
tent
for
the
girl
on
a
pretty
hill
that
sloped
toward
a
mountain
brook
in
the
evening
he
lassoed
and
milked
the
reindeer
and
gave
the
girl
milk
to
drink
he
brought
forth
dried
reindeer
meat
and
reindeer
cheese
which
his
people
had
stowed
away
on
the
heights
when
they
were
there
the
summer
before
still
the
girl
grumbled
all
the
while
and
was
never
satisfied
she
would
eat
neither
reindeer
meat
nor
reindeer
cheese
nor
would
she
drink
reindeer
milk
she
could
not
accustom
herself
to
squatting
in
the
tent
or
to
lying
on
the
ground
with
only
a
reindeer
skin
and
some
spruce
twigs
for
a
bed
the
son
of
the
mountains
laughed
at
her
woes
and
continued
to
treat
her
kindly
after
a
few
days
the
girl
went
up
to
the
boy
when
he
was
milking
and
asked
if
she
might
help
him
she
next
undertook
to
make
the
fire
under
the
kettle
in
which
the
reindeer
meat
was
to
be
cooked
then
to
carry
water
and
to
make
cheese
so
the
time
passed
pleasantly
the
weather
was
mild
and
food
was
easily
procured
together
they
set
snares
for
game
fished
for
in
the
rapids
and
picked
in
the
swamp
when
the
summer
was
gone
they
moved
farther
down
the
mountains
where
pine
and
leaf
forests
meet
there
they
pitched
their
tent
they
had
to
work
hard
every
day
but
fared
better
for
food
was
even
more
plentiful
than
in
the
summer
because
of
the
game
when
the
snow
came
and
the
lakes
began
to
freeze
they
drew
farther
east
toward
the
dense
pine
forests
as
soon
as
the
tent
was
up
the
winter
work
began
the
boy
taught
the
girl
to
make
twine
from
reindeer
sinews
to
treat
skins
to
make
shoes
and
clothing
of
hides
to
make
combs
and
tools
of
reindeer
horn
to
travel
on
skis
and
to
drive
a
sledge
drawn
by
reindeer
when
they
had
lived
through
the
dark
winter
and
the
sun
began
to
shine
all
day
and
most
of
the
night
the
boy
said
to
the
girl
that
now
he
would
accompany
her
southward
so
that
she
might
meet
some
of
her
own
race
then
the
girl
looked
at
him
astonished
do
you
want
to
send
me
away
she
asked
you
long
to
be
alone
with
your
reindeer
thought
that
you
were
the
one
that
longed
to
get
away
said
the
boy
have
lived
the
life
of
the
saméfolk
almost
a
year
now
replied
the
girl
i
ca
return
to
my
people
and
live
the
life
after
having
wandered
freely
on
mountains
and
in
forests
do
drive
me
away
but
let
me
stay
here
your
way
of
living
is
better
than
ours
the
girl
stayed
with
the
boy
for
the
rest
of
her
life
and
never
again
did
she
long
for
the
valleys
and
you
osa
if
you
were
to
stay
with
us
only
a
month
you
could
never
again
part
from
us
with
these
words
aslak
the
lapp
boy
finished
his
story
just
then
his
father
ola
serka
took
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
rose
old
ola
understood
more
swedish
than
he
was
willing
to
have
any
one
know
and
he
had
overheard
his
son
remarks
while
he
was
listening
it
had
suddenly
flashed
on
him
how
he
should
handle
this
delicate
matter
of
telling
jon
esserson
that
his
daughter
had
come
in
search
of
him
ola
serka
went
down
to
lake
luossajaure
and
had
walked
a
short
distance
along
the
strand
when
he
happened
upon
a
man
who
sat
on
a
rock
fishing
the
fisherman
was
and
bent
his
eyes
blinked
wearily
and
there
was
something
slack
and
helpless
about
him
he
looked
like
a
man
who
had
tried
to
carry
a
burden
too
heavy
for
him
or
to
solve
a
problem
too
difficult
for
him
who
had
become
broken
and
despondent
over
his
failure
you
must
have
had
luck
with
your
fishing
jon
since
you
been
at
it
all
night
said
the
mountaineer
in
lappish
as
he
approached
the
fisherman
gave
a
start
then
glanced
up
the
bait
on
his
hook
was
gone
and
not
a
fish
lay
on
the
strand
beside
him
he
hastened
to
rebait
the
hook
and
throw
out
the
line
in
the
meantime
the
mountaineer
squatted
on
the
grass
beside
him
there
a
matter
that
i
wanted
to
talk
over
with
you
said
ola
you
know
that
i
had
a
little
daughter
who
died
last
winter
and
we
have
always
missed
her
in
the
tent
yes
i
know
said
the
fisherman
abruptly
a
cloud
passing
over
his
face
as
though
he
disliked
being
reminded
of
a
dead
child
it
not
worth
while
to
spend
one
life
grieving
said
the
laplander
i
suppose
it
is
now
i
thinking
of
adopting
another
child
do
you
think
it
would
be
a
good
idea
that
depends
on
the
child
ola
i
will
tell
you
what
i
know
of
the
girl
said
ola
then
he
told
the
fisherman
that
around
two
strange
children
a
boy
and
a
girl
had
come
to
the
mines
to
look
for
their
father
but
as
their
father
was
away
they
had
stayed
to
await
his
return
while
there
the
boy
had
been
killed
by
a
blast
of
rock
thereupon
ola
gave
a
beautiful
description
of
how
brave
the
little
girl
had
been
and
of
how
she
had
won
the
admiration
and
sympathy
of
everyone
is
that
the
girl
you
want
to
take
into
your
tent
asked
the
fisherman
yes
returned
the
lapp
when
we
heard
her
story
we
were
all
deeply
touched
and
said
among
ourselves
that
so
good
a
sister
would
also
make
a
good
daughter
and
we
hoped
that
she
would
come
to
us
the
fisherman
sat
quietly
thinking
a
moment
it
was
plain
that
he
continued
the
conversation
only
to
please
his
friend
the
lapp
i
presume
the
girl
is
one
of
your
race
no
said
ola
she
does
belong
to
the
saméfolk
perhaps
she
the
daughter
of
some
new
settler
and
is
accustomed
to
the
life
here
no
she
from
the
far
south
replied
ola
as
if
this
was
of
small
importance
the
fisherman
grew
more
interested
then
i
do
believe
that
you
can
take
her
he
said
it
doubtful
if
she
could
stand
living
in
a
tent
in
winter
since
she
was
not
brought
up
that
way
she
will
find
kind
parents
and
kind
brothers
and
sisters
in
the
tent
insisted
ola
serka
it
worse
to
be
alone
than
to
freeze
the
fisherman
became
more
and
more
zealous
to
prevent
the
adoption
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
a
child
of
swedish
parents
being
taken
in
by
laplanders
you
said
just
now
that
she
had
a
father
in
the
mine
he
dead
said
the
lapp
abruptly
i
suppose
you
have
thoroughly
investigated
this
matter
ola
what
the
use
of
going
to
all
that
trouble
disdained
the
lapp
i
ought
to
know
would
the
girl
and
her
brother
have
been
obliged
to
roam
about
the
country
if
they
had
a
father
living
would
two
children
have
been
forced
to
care
for
themselves
if
they
had
a
father
the
girl
herself
thinks
he
alive
but
i
say
that
he
must
be
dead
the
man
with
the
tired
eyes
turned
to
ola
what
is
the
girl
name
ola
he
asked
the
mountaineer
thought
awhile
then
said
i
ca
remember
it
i
must
ask
her
ask
her
is
she
already
here
she
down
at
the
camp
what
ola
have
you
taken
her
in
before
knowing
her
father
wishes
what
do
i
care
for
her
father
if
he
is
dead
he
probably
the
kind
of
man
who
cares
nothing
for
his
child
he
may
be
glad
to
have
another
take
her
in
hand
the
fisherman
threw
down
his
rod
and
rose
with
an
alertness
in
his
movements
that
bespoke
new
life
i
do
think
her
father
can
be
like
other
folk
continued
the
mountaineer
i
dare
say
he
is
a
man
who
is
haunted
by
gloomy
forebodings
and
therefore
can
not
work
steadily
what
kind
of
a
father
would
that
be
for
the
girl
while
ola
was
talking
the
fisherman
started
up
the
strand
where
are
you
going
queried
the
lapp
i
going
to
have
a
look
at
your
ola
good
said
the
lapp
come
along
and
meet
her
i
think
you
say
that
she
will
be
a
good
daughter
to
me
the
swede
rushed
on
so
rapidly
that
the
laplander
could
hardly
keep
pace
with
him
after
a
moment
ola
said
to
his
companion
now
i
recall
that
her
name
is
osa
this
girl
i
adopting
the
other
man
only
kept
hurrying
along
and
old
ola
serka
was
so
well
pleased
that
he
wanted
to
laugh
aloud
when
they
came
in
sight
of
the
tents
ola
said
a
few
words
more
she
came
here
to
us
saméfolk
to
find
her
father
and
not
to
become
my
but
if
she
does
find
him
i
shall
be
glad
to
keep
her
in
my
tent
the
fisherman
hastened
all
the
faster
i
might
have
known
that
he
would
be
alarmed
when
i
threatened
to
take
his
daughter
into
the
lapps
quarters
laughed
ola
to
himself
when
the
man
from
kiruna
who
had
brought
osa
to
the
tent
turned
back
later
in
the
day
he
had
two
people
with
him
in
the
boat
who
sat
close
together
holding
hands
as
if
they
never
again
wanted
to
part
they
were
jon
esserson
and
his
daughter
both
were
unlike
what
they
had
been
a
few
hours
earlier
the
father
looked
less
bent
and
weary
and
his
eyes
were
clear
and
good
as
if
at
last
he
had
found
the
answer
to
that
which
had
troubled
him
so
long
osa
the
goose
girl
did
not
glance
longingly
about
for
she
had
found
some
one
to
care
for
her
and
now
she
could
be
a
child
again
homeward
bound
the
first
travelling
day
october
the
boy
sat
on
the
back
and
rode
up
amongst
the
clouds
some
thirty
geese
in
regular
order
flew
rapidly
southward
there
was
a
rustling
of
feathers
and
the
many
wings
beat
the
air
so
noisily
that
one
could
scarcely
hear
one
own
voice
akka
from
kebnekaise
flew
in
the
lead
after
her
came
yksi
and
kaksi
kolme
and
neljä
viisi
and
kuusi
morten
and
dunfin
the
six
goslings
which
had
accompanied
the
flock
the
autumn
before
had
now
left
to
look
after
themselves
instead
the
old
geese
were
taking
with
them
goslings
that
had
grown
up
in
the
glen
that
summer
eleven
flew
to
the
right
eleven
to
the
left
and
they
did
their
best
to
fly
at
even
distances
like
the
big
birds
the
poor
youngsters
had
never
before
been
on
a
long
trip
and
at
first
they
had
difficulty
in
keeping
up
with
the
rapid
flight
akka
from
kebnekaise
akka
from
kebnekaise
they
cried
in
plaintive
tones
what
the
matter
said
the
sharply
our
wings
are
tired
of
moving
our
wings
are
tired
of
moving
wailed
the
young
ones
the
longer
you
keep
it
up
the
better
it
will
go
answered
the
without
slackening
her
speed
and
she
was
quite
right
for
when
the
goslings
had
flown
two
hours
longer
they
complained
no
more
of
being
tired
but
in
the
mountain
glen
they
had
been
in
the
habit
of
eating
all
day
long
and
very
soon
they
began
to
feel
hungry
akka
akka
akka
from
kebnekaise
wailed
the
goslings
pitifully
what
the
trouble
now
asked
the
we
so
hungry
we
ca
fly
any
more
whimpered
the
goslings
so
hungry
we
ca
fly
any
more
wild
geese
must
learn
to
eat
air
and
drink
wind
said
the
and
kept
right
on
flying
it
actually
seemed
as
if
the
young
ones
were
learning
to
live
on
wind
and
air
for
when
they
had
flown
a
little
longer
they
said
nothing
more
about
being
hungry
the
goose
flock
was
still
in
the
mountain
regions
and
the
old
geese
called
out
the
names
of
all
the
peaks
as
they
flew
past
so
that
the
youngsters
might
learn
them
when
they
had
been
calling
out
a
while
this
is
porsotjokko
this
is
särjaktjokko
this
is
sulitelma
and
so
on
the
goslings
became
impatient
again
akka
akka
akka
they
shrieked
in
tones
what
wrong
said
the
we
have
room
in
our
heads
for
any
more
of
those
awful
names
shrieked
the
goslings
the
more
you
put
into
your
heads
the
more
you
can
get
into
them
retorted
the
and
continued
to
call
out
the
queer
names
the
boy
sat
thinking
that
it
was
about
time
the
wild
geese
betook
themselves
southward
for
so
much
snow
had
fallen
that
the
ground
was
white
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
there
was
no
use
denying
that
it
had
been
rather
disagreeable
in
the
glen
toward
the
last
rain
and
fog
had
succeeded
each
other
without
any
relief
and
even
if
it
did
clear
up
once
in
a
while
immediately
frost
set
in
berries
and
mushrooms
upon
which
the
boy
had
subsisted
during
the
summer
were
either
frozen
or
decayed
finally
he
had
been
compelled
to
eat
raw
fish
which
was
something
he
disliked
the
days
had
grown
short
and
the
long
evenings
and
late
mornings
were
rather
tiresome
for
one
who
could
not
sleep
the
whole
time
that
the
sun
was
away
now
at
last
the
goslings
wings
had
grown
so
that
the
geese
could
start
for
the
south
the
boy
was
so
happy
that
he
laughed
and
sang
as
he
rode
on
the
goose
back
it
was
not
only
on
account
of
the
darkness
and
cold
that
he
longed
to
get
away
from
lapland
there
were
other
reasons
too
the
first
weeks
of
his
sojourn
there
the
boy
had
not
been
the
least
bit
homesick
he
thought
he
had
never
before
seen
such
a
glorious
country
the
only
worry
he
had
had
was
to
keep
the
mosquitoes
from
eating
him
up
the
boy
had
seen
very
little
of
the
because
the
big
white
gander
thought
only
of
his
dunfin
and
was
unwilling
to
leave
her
for
a
moment
on
the
other
hand
thumbietot
had
stuck
to
akka
and
gorgo
the
eagle
and
the
three
of
them
had
passed
many
happy
hours
together
the
two
birds
had
taken
him
with
them
on
long
trips
he
had
stood
on
mount
kebnekaise
had
looked
down
at
the
glaciers
and
visited
many
high
cliffs
seldom
tramped
by
human
feet
akka
had
shown
him
mountain
dales
and
had
let
him
peep
into
caves
where
mother
wolves
brought
up
their
young
he
had
also
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
tame
reindeer
that
grazed
in
herds
along
the
shores
of
the
beautiful
torne
lake
and
he
had
been
down
to
the
great
falls
and
brought
greetings
to
the
bears
that
lived
thereabouts
from
their
friends
and
relatives
in
westmanland
ever
since
he
had
seen
osa
the
goose
girl
he
longed
for
the
day
when
he
might
go
home
with
morten
and
be
a
normal
human
being
once
more
he
wanted
to
be
himself
again
so
that
osa
would
not
be
afraid
to
talk
to
him
and
would
not
shut
the
door
in
his
face
yes
indeed
he
was
glad
that
at
last
they
were
speeding
southward
he
waved
his
cap
and
cheered
when
he
saw
the
first
pine
forest
in
the
same
manner
he
greeted
the
first
gray
cabin
the
first
goat
the
first
cat
and
the
first
chicken
they
were
continually
meeting
birds
of
passage
flying
now
in
greater
flocks
than
in
the
spring
where
are
you
bound
for
wild
geese
called
the
passing
birds
where
are
you
bound
for
we
like
yourselves
are
going
abroad
answered
the
geese
those
goslings
of
yours
are
ready
to
fly
screamed
the
others
they
never
cross
the
sea
with
those
puny
wings
laplander
and
reindeer
were
also
leaving
the
mountains
when
the
wild
geese
sighted
the
reindeer
they
circled
down
and
called
out
thanks
for
your
company
this
summer
a
pleasant
journey
to
you
and
a
welcome
back
returned
the
reindeer
but
when
the
bears
saw
the
wild
geese
they
pointed
them
out
to
the
cubs
and
growled
just
look
at
those
geese
they
are
so
afraid
of
a
little
cold
they
do
dare
to
stay
at
home
in
winter
but
the
old
geese
were
ready
with
a
retort
and
cried
to
their
goslings
look
at
those
beasts
that
stay
at
home
and
sleep
half
the
year
rather
than
go
to
the
trouble
of
travelling
south
down
in
the
pine
forest
the
young
grouse
sat
huddled
together
and
gazed
longingly
after
the
big
bird
flocks
which
amid
joy
and
merriment
proceeded
southward
when
will
our
turn
come
they
asked
the
mother
grouse
you
will
have
to
stay
at
home
with
mamma
and
papa
she
said
legends
from
härjedalen
october
the
boy
had
had
three
days
travel
in
the
rain
and
mist
and
longed
for
some
sheltered
nook
where
he
might
rest
awhile
at
last
the
geese
alighted
to
feed
and
ease
their
wings
a
bit
to
his
great
relief
the
boy
saw
an
observation
tower
on
a
hill
close
by
and
dragged
himself
to
it
when
he
had
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
tower
he
found
a
party
of
tourists
there
so
he
quickly
crawled
into
a
dark
corner
and
was
soon
sound
asleep
when
the
boy
awoke
he
began
to
feel
uneasy
because
the
tourists
lingered
so
long
in
the
tower
telling
stories
he
thought
they
would
never
go
morten
could
not
come
for
him
while
they
were
there
and
he
knew
of
course
that
the
wild
geese
were
in
a
hurry
to
continue
the
journey
in
the
middle
of
a
story
he
thought
he
heard
honking
and
the
beating
of
wings
as
if
the
geese
were
flying
away
but
he
did
not
dare
to
venture
over
to
the
balustrade
to
find
out
if
it
was
so
at
last
when
the
tourists
were
gone
and
the
boy
could
crawl
from
his
hiding
place
he
saw
no
wild
geese
and
no
morten
came
to
fetch
him
he
called
here
am
i
where
are
you
as
loud
as
he
could
but
his
travelling
companions
did
not
appear
not
for
a
second
did
he
think
they
had
deserted
him
but
he
feared
that
they
had
met
with
some
mishap
and
was
wondering
what
he
should
do
to
find
them
when
bataki
the
raven
lit
beside
him
the
boy
never
dreamed
that
he
should
greet
bataki
with
such
a
glad
welcome
as
he
now
gave
him
dear
bataki
he
burst
forth
how
fortunate
that
you
are
here
maybe
you
know
what
has
become
of
morten
and
the
wild
geese
i
just
come
with
a
greeting
from
them
replied
the
raven
akka
saw
a
hunter
prowling
about
on
the
mountain
and
therefore
dared
not
stay
to
wait
for
you
but
has
gone
on
ahead
get
up
on
my
back
and
you
shall
soon
be
with
your
friends
the
boy
quickly
seated
himself
on
the
raven
back
and
bataki
would
soon
have
caught
up
with
the
geese
had
he
not
been
hindered
by
a
fog
it
was
as
if
the
morning
sun
had
awakened
it
to
life
little
light
veils
of
mist
rose
suddenly
from
the
lake
from
fields
and
from
the
forest
they
thickened
and
spread
with
marvellous
rapidity
and
soon
the
entire
ground
was
hidden
from
sight
by
white
rolling
mists
bataki
flew
along
above
the
fog
in
clear
air
and
sparkling
sunshine
but
the
wild
geese
must
have
circled
down
among
the
damp
clouds
for
it
was
impossible
to
sight
them
the
boy
and
the
raven
called
and
shrieked
but
got
no
response
well
this
is
a
stroke
of
ill
luck
said
bataki
finally
but
we
know
that
they
are
travelling
toward
the
south
and
of
course
i
find
them
as
soon
as
the
mist
clears
the
boy
was
distressed
at
the
thought
of
being
parted
from
morten
just
now
when
the
geese
were
on
the
wing
and
the
big
white
one
might
meet
with
all
sorts
of
mishaps
after
thumbietot
had
been
sitting
worrying
for
two
hours
or
more
he
remarked
to
himself
that
thus
far
there
had
been
no
mishap
and
it
was
not
worth
while
to
lose
heart
just
then
he
heard
a
rooster
crowing
down
on
the
ground
and
instantly
he
bent
forward
on
the
raven
back
and
called
out
what
the
name
of
the
country
i
travelling
over
it
called
härjedalen
härjedalen
härjedalen
crowed
the
rooster
how
does
it
look
down
there
where
you
are
the
boy
asked
cliffs
in
the
west
woods
in
the
east
broad
valleys
across
the
whole
country
replied
the
rooster
thank
you
cried
the
boy
you
give
a
clear
account
of
it
when
they
had
travelled
a
little
farther
he
heard
a
crow
cawing
down
in
the
mist
what
kind
of
people
live
in
this
country
shouted
the
boy
good
thrifty
peasants
answered
the
crow
good
thrifty
peasants
what
do
they
do
asked
the
boy
what
do
they
do
they
raise
cattle
and
fell
forests
cawed
the
crow
thanks
replied
the
boy
you
answer
well
a
bit
farther
on
he
heard
a
human
voice
yodeling
and
singing
down
in
the
mist
is
there
any
large
city
in
this
part
of
the
country
the
boy
asked
what
what
who
is
it
that
calls
cried
the
human
voice
is
there
any
large
city
in
this
region
the
boy
repeated
i
want
to
know
who
it
is
that
calls
shouted
the
human
voice
i
might
have
known
that
i
could
get
no
information
when
i
asked
a
human
being
a
civil
question
the
boy
retorted
it
was
not
long
before
the
mist
went
away
as
suddenly
as
it
had
come
then
the
boy
saw
a
beautiful
landscape
with
high
cliffs
as
in
jämtland
but
there
were
no
large
flourishing
settlements
on
the
mountain
slopes
the
villages
lay
far
apart
and
the
farms
were
small
bataki
followed
the
stream
southward
till
they
came
within
sight
of
a
village
there
he
alighted
in
a
stubble
field
and
let
the
boy
dismount
in
the
summer
grain
grew
on
this
ground
said
bataki
look
around
and
see
if
you
ca
find
something
eatable
the
boy
acted
upon
the
suggestion
and
before
long
he
found
a
blade
of
wheat
as
he
picked
out
the
grains
and
ate
them
bataki
talked
to
him
do
you
see
that
mountain
towering
directly
south
of
us
he
asked
yes
of
course
i
see
it
said
the
boy
it
is
called
sonfjället
continued
the
raven
you
can
imagine
that
wolves
were
plentiful
there
once
upon
a
time
it
must
have
been
an
ideal
place
for
wolves
said
the
boy
the
people
who
lived
here
in
the
valley
were
frequently
attacked
by
them
remarked
the
raven
perhaps
you
remember
a
good
wolf
story
you
could
tell
me
said
the
boy
i
been
told
that
a
long
long
time
ago
the
wolves
from
sonfjället
are
supposed
to
have
waylaid
a
man
who
had
gone
out
to
peddle
his
wares
began
bataki
he
was
from
hede
a
village
a
few
miles
down
the
valley
it
was
winter
time
and
the
wolves
made
for
him
as
he
was
driving
over
the
ice
on
lake
ljusna
there
were
about
nine
or
ten
and
the
man
from
hede
had
a
poor
old
horse
so
there
was
very
little
hope
of
his
escaping
when
the
man
heard
the
wolves
howl
and
saw
how
many
there
were
after
him
he
lost
his
head
and
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
he
ought
to
dump
his
casks
and
jugs
out
of
the
sledge
to
lighten
the
load
he
only
whipped
up
the
horse
and
made
the
best
speed
he
could
but
he
soon
observed
that
the
wolves
were
gaining
on
him
the
shores
were
desolate
and
he
was
fourteen
miles
from
the
nearest
farm
he
thought
that
his
final
hour
had
come
and
was
paralyzed
with
fear
while
he
sat
there
terrified
he
saw
something
move
in
the
brush
which
had
been
set
in
the
ice
to
mark
out
the
road
and
when
he
discovered
who
it
was
that
walked
there
his
fear
grew
more
and
more
intense
wild
beasts
were
not
coming
toward
him
but
a
poor
old
woman
named
who
was
in
the
habit
of
roaming
about
on
highways
and
byways
she
was
a
hunchback
and
slightly
lame
so
he
recognized
her
at
a
distance
the
old
woman
was
walking
straight
toward
the
wolves
the
sledge
had
hidden
them
from
her
view
and
the
man
comprehended
at
once
that
if
he
were
to
drive
on
without
warning
her
she
would
walk
right
into
the
jaws
of
the
wild
beasts
and
while
they
were
rending
her
he
would
have
time
enough
to
get
away
the
old
woman
walked
slowly
bent
over
a
cane
it
was
plain
that
she
was
doomed
if
he
did
not
help
her
but
even
if
he
were
to
stop
and
take
her
into
the
sledge
it
was
by
no
means
certain
that
she
would
be
safe
more
than
likely
the
wolves
would
catch
up
with
them
and
he
and
she
and
the
horse
would
all
be
killed
he
wondered
if
it
were
not
better
to
sacrifice
one
life
in
order
that
two
might
be
spared
this
flashed
upon
him
the
minute
he
saw
the
old
woman
he
had
also
time
to
think
how
it
would
be
with
him
afterward
if
perchance
he
might
not
regret
that
he
had
not
succoured
her
or
if
people
should
some
day
learn
of
the
meeting
and
that
he
had
not
tried
to
help
her
it
was
a
terrible
temptation
would
rather
not
have
seen
her
he
said
to
himself
just
then
the
wolves
howled
savagely
the
horse
reared
plunged
forward
and
dashed
past
the
old
beggar
woman
she
too
had
heard
the
howling
of
the
wolves
and
as
the
man
from
hede
drove
by
he
saw
that
the
old
woman
knew
what
awaited
her
she
stood
motionless
her
mouth
open
for
a
cry
her
arms
stretched
out
for
help
but
she
neither
cried
nor
tried
to
throw
herself
into
the
sledge
something
seemed
to
have
turned
her
to
stone
was
i
thought
the
man
must
have
looked
like
a
demon
as
i
passed
he
tried
to
feel
satisfied
now
that
he
was
certain
of
escape
but
at
that
very
moment
his
heart
reproached
him
never
before
had
he
done
a
dastardly
thing
and
he
felt
now
that
his
whole
life
was
blasted
come
what
may
he
said
and
reined
in
the
horse
can
not
leave
her
alone
with
the
wolves
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
he
got
the
horse
to
turn
but
in
the
end
he
managed
it
and
promptly
drove
back
to
her
quick
and
get
into
the
sledge
he
said
gruffly
for
he
was
mad
with
himself
for
not
leaving
the
old
woman
to
her
fate
might
stay
at
home
once
in
awhile
you
old
hag
he
growled
both
my
horse
and
i
will
come
to
grief
on
your
account
the
old
woman
did
not
say
a
word
but
the
man
from
hede
was
in
no
mood
to
spare
her
horse
has
already
tramped
miles
and
the
load
has
lightened
any
since
you
got
up
on
it
he
grumbled
that
you
must
understand
he
soon
be
exhausted
the
sledge
runners
crunched
on
the
ice
but
for
all
that
he
heard
how
the
wolves
panted
and
knew
that
the
beasts
were
almost
upon
him
all
up
with
us
he
said
good
it
was
either
to
you
or
to
me
this
attempt
to
save
you
up
to
this
point
the
old
woman
had
been
silent
like
one
who
is
accustomed
to
take
abuse
but
now
she
said
a
few
words
ca
understand
why
you
do
throw
out
your
wares
and
lighten
the
load
you
can
come
back
again
and
gather
them
up
the
man
realized
that
this
was
sound
advice
and
was
surprised
that
he
had
not
thought
of
it
before
he
tossed
the
reins
to
the
old
woman
loosed
the
ropes
that
bound
the
casks
and
pitched
them
out
the
wolves
were
right
upon
them
but
now
they
stopped
to
examine
that
which
was
thrown
on
the
ice
and
the
travellers
again
had
the
start
of
them
this
does
not
help
you
said
the
old
woman
understand
of
course
that
i
will
give
myself
up
to
the
wolves
voluntarily
that
you
may
escape
while
she
was
speaking
the
man
was
trying
to
push
a
heavy
brewer
vat
from
the
long
sledge
as
he
tugged
at
this
he
paused
as
if
he
could
not
quite
make
up
his
mind
to
throw
it
out
but
in
reality
his
mind
was
taken
up
with
something
altogether
different
a
man
and
a
horse
who
have
no
infirmities
need
not
let
a
feeble
old
woman
be
devoured
by
wolves
for
their
sakes
he
thought
must
be
some
other
way
of
salvation
why
of
course
there
is
it
only
my
stupidity
that
hinders
me
from
finding
the
way
again
he
started
to
push
the
vat
then
paused
once
more
and
burst
out
laughing
the
old
woman
was
alarmed
and
wondered
if
he
had
gone
mad
but
the
man
from
hede
was
laughing
at
himself
because
he
had
been
so
stupid
all
the
while
it
was
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
to
save
all
three
of
them
he
could
not
imagine
why
he
had
not
thought
of
it
before
to
what
i
say
to
you
malin
he
said
was
splendid
of
you
to
be
willing
to
throw
yourself
to
the
wolves
but
you
wo
have
to
do
that
because
i
know
how
we
can
all
three
be
helped
without
endangering
the
life
of
any
remember
whatever
i
may
do
you
are
to
sit
still
and
drive
down
to
linsäll
there
you
must
waken
the
townspeople
and
tell
them
that
i
alone
out
here
on
the
ice
surrounded
by
wolves
and
ask
them
to
come
and
help
me
the
man
waited
until
the
wolves
were
almost
upon
the
sledge
then
he
rolled
out
the
big
brewer
vat
jumped
down
and
crawled
in
under
it
it
was
a
huge
vat
large
enough
to
hold
a
whole
christmas
brew
the
wolves
pounced
upon
it
and
bit
at
the
hoops
but
the
vat
was
too
heavy
for
them
to
move
they
could
not
get
at
the
man
inside
he
knew
that
he
was
safe
and
laughed
at
the
wolves
after
a
bit
he
was
serious
again
the
future
when
i
get
into
a
tight
place
i
shall
remember
this
vat
and
i
shall
bear
in
mind
that
i
need
never
wrong
either
myself
or
others
for
there
is
always
a
third
way
out
of
a
difficulty
if
only
one
can
hit
upon
it
with
this
bataki
closed
his
narrative
the
boy
noticed
that
the
raven
never
spoke
unless
there
was
some
special
meaning
back
of
his
words
and
the
longer
he
listened
to
him
the
more
thoughtful
he
became
i
wonder
why
you
told
me
that
story
remarked
the
boy
i
just
happened
to
think
of
it
as
i
stood
here
gazing
up
at
sonfjället
replied
the
raven
now
they
had
travelled
farther
down
lake
ljusna
and
in
an
hour
or
so
they
came
to
kolsätt
close
to
the
border
of
hälsingland
here
the
raven
alighted
near
a
little
hut
that
had
no
windows
only
a
shutter
from
the
chimney
rose
sparks
and
smoke
and
from
within
the
sound
of
heavy
hammering
was
heard
whenever
i
see
this
smithy
observed
the
raven
i
reminded
that
in
former
times
there
were
such
skilled
blacksmiths
here
in
härjedalen
more
especially
in
this
village
that
they
could
be
matched
in
the
whole
country
perhaps
you
also
remember
a
story
about
them
said
the
boy
yes
returned
bataki
i
remember
one
about
a
smith
from
härjedalen
who
once
invited
two
other
master
blacksmiths
one
from
dalecarlia
and
one
from
vermland
to
compete
with
him
at
the
challenge
was
accepted
and
the
three
blacksmiths
met
here
at
kolsätt
the
dalecarlian
began
he
forged
a
dozen
nails
so
even
and
smooth
and
sharp
that
they
could
be
improved
upon
after
him
came
the
vermlander
he
too
forged
a
dozen
nails
which
were
quite
perfect
and
moreover
he
finished
them
in
half
the
time
that
it
took
the
dalecarlian
when
the
judges
saw
this
they
said
to
the
härjedal
smith
that
it
would
be
worth
while
for
him
to
try
since
he
could
not
forge
better
than
the
dalecarlian
or
faster
than
the
vermlander
give
up
there
must
be
still
another
way
of
excelling
insisted
the
härjedal
smith
he
placed
the
iron
on
the
anvil
without
heating
it
at
the
forge
he
simply
hammered
it
hot
and
forged
nail
after
nail
without
the
use
of
either
anvil
or
bellows
none
of
the
judges
had
ever
seen
a
blacksmith
wield
a
hammer
more
masterfully
and
the
härjedal
smith
was
proclaimed
the
best
in
the
land
with
these
remarks
bataki
subsided
and
the
boy
grew
even
more
thoughtful
i
wonder
what
your
purpose
was
in
telling
me
that
he
queried
the
story
dropped
into
my
mind
when
i
saw
the
old
smithy
again
said
bataki
in
an
offhand
manner
the
two
travellers
rose
again
into
the
air
and
the
raven
carried
the
boy
southward
till
they
came
to
lillhärdal
parish
where
he
alighted
on
a
leafy
mound
at
the
top
of
a
ridge
i
wonder
if
you
know
upon
what
mound
you
are
standing
said
bataki
the
boy
had
to
confess
that
he
did
not
know
this
is
a
grave
said
bataki
beneath
this
mound
lies
the
first
settler
in
härjedalen
perhaps
you
have
a
story
to
tell
of
him
too
said
the
boy
i
have
heard
much
about
him
but
i
think
he
was
a
norwegian
he
had
served
with
a
norwegian
king
got
into
his
bad
graces
and
had
to
flee
the
country
later
he
went
over
to
the
swedish
king
who
lived
at
upsala
and
took
service
with
him
but
after
a
time
he
asked
for
the
hand
of
the
sister
in
marriage
and
when
the
king
would
give
him
such
a
bride
he
eloped
with
her
by
that
time
he
had
managed
to
get
himself
into
such
disfavour
that
it
was
safe
for
him
to
live
either
in
norway
or
sweden
and
he
did
not
wish
to
move
to
a
foreign
country
there
must
still
be
a
course
open
to
me
he
thought
with
his
servants
and
treasures
he
journeyed
through
dalecarlia
until
he
arrived
in
the
desolate
forests
beyond
the
outskirts
of
the
province
there
he
settled
built
houses
and
broke
up
land
thus
you
see
he
was
the
first
man
to
settle
in
this
part
of
the
country
as
the
boy
listened
to
the
last
story
he
looked
very
serious
i
wonder
what
your
object
is
in
telling
me
all
this
he
repeated
bataki
twisted
and
turned
and
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
it
was
some
time
before
he
answered
the
boy
since
we
are
here
alone
he
said
finally
i
shall
take
this
opportunity
to
question
you
regarding
a
certain
matter
have
you
ever
tried
to
ascertain
upon
what
terms
the
elf
who
transformed
you
was
to
restore
you
to
a
normal
human
being
the
only
stipulation
i
heard
anything
about
was
that
i
should
take
the
white
up
to
lapland
and
bring
him
back
to
skåne
safe
and
sound
i
thought
as
much
said
bataki
for
when
last
we
met
you
talked
confidently
of
there
being
nothing
more
contemptible
than
deceiving
a
friend
who
trusts
one
you
better
ask
akka
about
the
terms
you
know
i
dare
say
that
she
was
at
your
home
and
talked
with
the
elf
akka
has
told
me
of
this
said
the
boy
wonderingly
she
must
have
thought
that
it
was
best
for
you
not
to
know
just
what
the
elf
say
naturally
she
would
rather
help
you
than
morten
it
is
singular
bataki
that
you
always
have
a
way
of
making
me
feel
unhappy
and
anxious
said
the
boy
i
dare
say
it
might
seem
so
continued
the
raven
but
this
time
i
believe
that
you
will
be
grateful
to
me
for
telling
you
that
the
words
were
to
this
effect
you
were
to
become
a
normal
human
being
again
if
you
would
bring
back
morten
that
your
mother
might
lay
him
on
the
block
and
chop
his
head
off
the
boy
leaped
up
that
only
one
of
your
base
fabrications
he
cried
indignantly
you
can
ask
akka
yourself
said
bataki
i
see
her
coming
up
there
with
her
whole
flock
and
do
forget
what
i
have
told
you
there
is
usually
a
way
out
of
all
difficulties
if
only
one
can
find
it
i
shall
be
interested
to
see
what
success
you
have
vermland
and
dalsland
october
the
boy
took
advantage
of
the
rest
hour
when
akka
was
feeding
apart
from
the
other
wild
geese
to
ask
her
if
that
which
bataki
had
related
was
true
and
akka
could
not
deny
it
the
boy
made
the
promise
that
she
would
not
divulge
the
secret
to
morten
the
big
white
gander
was
so
brave
and
generous
that
he
might
do
something
rash
were
he
to
learn
of
the
elf
stipulations
later
the
boy
sat
on
the
glum
and
silent
and
hung
his
head
he
heard
the
wild
geese
call
out
to
the
goslings
that
now
they
were
in
dalarne
they
could
see
städjan
in
the
north
and
that
now
they
were
flying
over
österdal
river
to
horrmund
lake
and
were
coming
to
vesterdal
river
but
the
boy
did
not
care
even
to
glance
at
all
this
i
shall
probably
travel
around
with
wild
geese
the
rest
of
my
life
he
remarked
to
himself
and
i
am
likely
to
see
more
of
this
land
than
i
wish
he
was
quite
as
indifferent
when
the
wild
geese
called
out
to
him
that
now
they
had
arrived
in
vermland
and
that
the
stream
they
were
following
southward
was
klarälven
i
seen
so
many
rivers
already
thought
the
boy
why
bother
to
look
at
one
more
even
had
he
been
more
eager
for
there
was
not
very
much
to
be
seen
for
northern
vermland
is
nothing
but
vast
monotonous
forest
tracts
through
which
klarälven
winds
narrow
and
rich
in
rapids
here
and
there
one
can
see
a
charcoal
kiln
a
forest
clearing
or
a
few
low
chimneyless
huts
occupied
by
finns
but
the
forest
as
a
whole
is
so
extensive
one
might
fancy
it
was
far
up
in
lapland
a
little
homestead
october
the
wild
geese
followed
klarälven
as
far
as
the
big
iron
foundries
at
monk
fors
then
they
proceeded
westward
to
fryksdalen
before
they
got
to
lake
fryken
it
began
to
grow
dusky
and
they
lit
in
a
little
wet
morass
on
a
wooded
hill
the
morass
was
certainly
a
good
night
quarter
for
the
wild
geese
but
the
boy
thought
it
dismal
and
rough
and
wished
for
a
better
sleeping
place
while
he
was
still
high
in
the
air
he
had
noticed
that
below
the
ridge
lay
a
number
of
farms
and
with
great
haste
he
proceeded
to
seek
them
out
they
were
farther
away
than
he
had
fancied
and
several
times
he
was
tempted
to
turn
back
presently
the
woods
became
less
dense
and
he
came
to
a
road
skirting
the
edge
of
the
forest
from
it
branched
a
pretty
lane
which
led
down
to
a
farm
and
immediately
he
hastened
toward
it
first
the
boy
entered
a
farm
yard
as
large
as
a
city
marketplace
and
enclosed
by
a
long
row
of
red
houses
as
he
crossed
the
yard
he
saw
another
farm
where
the
faced
a
gravel
path
and
a
wide
lawn
back
of
the
house
there
was
a
garden
thick
with
foliage
the
dwelling
itself
was
small
and
humble
but
the
garden
was
edged
by
a
row
of
exceedingly
tall
trees
so
close
together
that
they
formed
a
real
wall
around
it
it
appeared
to
the
boy
as
if
he
were
coming
into
a
great
chamber
with
the
lovely
blue
sky
for
a
ceiling
the
were
thick
with
clusters
of
red
berries
the
grass
plots
were
still
green
of
course
but
that
night
there
was
a
full
moon
and
as
the
bright
moonlight
fell
upon
the
grass
it
looked
as
white
as
silver
no
human
being
was
in
sight
and
the
boy
could
wander
freely
wherever
he
wished
when
he
was
in
the
garden
he
saw
something
which
almost
put
him
in
good
humour
he
had
climbed
a
to
eat
berries
but
before
he
could
reach
a
cluster
he
caught
sight
of
a
barberry
bush
which
was
also
full
of
berries
he
slid
along
the
ash
branch
and
clambered
up
into
the
barberry
bush
but
he
was
no
sooner
there
than
he
discovered
a
currant
bush
on
which
still
hung
long
red
clusters
next
he
saw
that
the
garden
was
full
of
gooseberries
and
raspberries
and
bushes
that
there
were
cabbages
and
turnips
in
the
vegetable
beds
and
berries
on
every
bush
seeds
on
the
herbs
and
ears
on
every
blade
and
there
on
the
path
no
of
course
he
could
not
mistake
it
was
a
big
red
apple
which
shone
in
the
moonlight
the
boy
sat
down
at
the
side
of
the
path
with
the
big
red
apple
in
front
of
him
and
began
cutting
little
pieces
from
it
with
his
sheath
knife
it
would
be
such
a
serious
matter
to
be
an
elf
all
one
life
if
it
were
always
as
easy
to
get
good
food
as
it
is
here
he
thought
he
sat
and
mused
as
he
ate
wondering
finally
if
it
would
not
be
as
well
for
him
to
remain
here
and
let
the
wild
geese
travel
south
without
him
i
do
know
for
the
life
of
me
how
i
can
ever
explain
to
morten
that
i
can
not
go
home
thought
he
it
would
be
better
were
i
to
leave
him
altogether
i
could
gather
provisions
enough
for
the
winter
as
well
as
the
squirrels
do
and
if
i
were
to
live
in
a
dark
corner
of
the
stable
or
the
cow
shed
i
should
freeze
to
death
just
as
he
was
thinking
this
he
heard
a
light
rustle
over
his
head
and
a
second
later
something
which
resembled
a
birch
stump
stood
on
the
ground
beside
him
the
stump
twisted
and
turned
and
two
bright
dots
on
top
of
it
glowed
like
coals
of
fire
it
looked
like
some
enchantment
however
the
boy
soon
remarked
that
the
stump
had
a
hooked
beak
and
big
feather
wreaths
around
its
glowing
eyes
then
he
knew
that
this
was
no
enchantment
it
is
a
real
pleasure
to
meet
a
living
creature
remarked
the
boy
perhaps
you
will
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
the
name
of
this
place
brown
owl
and
what
sort
of
folk
live
here
that
evening
as
on
all
other
evenings
the
owl
had
perched
on
a
rung
of
the
big
ladder
propped
against
the
roof
from
which
she
had
looked
down
toward
the
gravel
walks
and
grass
plots
watching
for
rats
very
much
to
her
surprise
not
a
single
grayskin
had
appeared
she
saw
instead
something
that
looked
like
a
human
being
but
much
much
smaller
moving
about
in
the
garden
that
the
one
who
is
scaring
away
the
rats
thought
the
owl
what
in
the
world
can
it
be
it
not
a
squirrel
nor
a
kitten
nor
a
weasel
she
observed
i
suppose
that
a
bird
who
has
lived
on
an
old
place
like
this
as
long
as
i
have
ought
to
know
about
everything
in
the
world
but
this
is
beyond
my
comprehension
she
concluded
she
had
been
staring
at
the
object
that
moved
on
the
gravel
path
until
her
eyes
burned
finally
curiosity
got
the
better
of
her
and
she
flew
down
to
the
ground
to
have
a
closer
view
of
the
stranger
when
the
boy
began
to
speak
the
owl
bent
forward
and
looked
him
up
and
down
he
has
neither
claws
nor
horns
she
remarked
to
herself
yet
who
knows
but
he
may
have
a
poisonous
fang
or
some
even
more
dangerous
weapon
i
must
try
to
find
out
what
he
passes
for
before
i
venture
to
touch
him
the
place
is
called
mårbacka
said
the
owl
and
gentlefolk
lived
here
once
upon
a
time
but
you
yourself
who
are
you
i
think
of
moving
in
here
volunteered
the
boy
without
answering
the
owl
question
would
it
be
possible
do
you
think
oh
yes
but
it
not
much
of
a
place
now
compared
to
what
it
was
once
said
the
owl
you
can
weather
it
here
i
dare
say
it
all
depends
upon
what
you
expect
to
live
on
do
you
intend
to
take
up
the
rat
chase
oh
by
no
means
declared
the
boy
there
is
more
fear
of
the
rats
eating
me
than
that
i
shall
do
them
any
harm
it
ca
be
that
he
is
as
harmless
as
he
says
thought
the
brown
owl
all
the
same
i
believe
i
make
an
attempt
she
rose
into
the
air
and
in
a
second
her
claws
were
fastened
in
nils
holgersson
shoulder
and
she
was
trying
to
hack
at
his
eyes
the
boy
shielded
both
eyes
with
one
hand
and
tried
to
free
himself
with
the
other
at
the
same
time
calling
with
all
his
might
for
help
he
realized
that
he
was
in
deadly
peril
and
thought
that
this
time
surely
it
was
all
over
with
him
now
i
must
tell
you
of
a
strange
coincidence
the
very
year
that
nils
holgersson
travelled
with
the
wild
geese
there
was
a
woman
who
thought
of
writing
a
book
about
sweden
which
would
be
suitable
for
children
to
read
in
the
schools
she
had
thought
of
this
from
christmas
time
until
the
following
autumn
but
not
a
line
of
the
book
had
she
written
at
last
she
became
so
tired
of
the
whole
thing
that
she
said
to
herself
you
are
not
fitted
for
such
work
sit
down
and
compose
stories
and
legends
as
usual
and
let
another
write
this
book
which
has
got
to
be
serious
and
instructive
and
in
which
there
must
not
be
one
untruthful
word
it
was
as
good
as
settled
that
she
would
abandon
the
idea
but
she
thought
very
naturally
it
would
have
been
agreeable
to
write
something
beautiful
about
sweden
and
it
was
hard
for
her
to
relinquish
her
work
finally
it
occurred
to
her
that
maybe
it
was
because
she
lived
in
a
city
with
only
gray
streets
and
house
walls
around
her
that
she
could
make
no
headway
with
the
writing
perhaps
if
she
were
to
go
into
the
country
where
she
could
see
woods
and
fields
that
it
might
go
better
she
was
from
vermland
and
it
was
perfectly
clear
to
her
that
she
wished
to
begin
the
book
with
that
province
first
of
all
she
would
write
about
the
place
where
she
had
grown
up
it
was
a
little
homestead
far
removed
from
the
great
world
where
many
habits
and
customs
were
retained
she
thought
that
it
would
be
entertaining
for
children
to
hear
of
the
manifold
duties
which
had
succeeded
one
another
the
year
around
she
wanted
to
tell
them
how
they
celebrated
christmas
and
new
year
and
easter
and
midsummer
day
in
her
home
what
kind
of
house
furnishings
they
had
what
the
kitchen
and
larder
were
like
and
how
the
cow
shed
stable
lodge
and
bath
house
had
looked
but
when
she
was
to
write
about
it
the
pen
would
not
move
why
this
was
she
could
not
in
the
least
understand
nevertheless
it
was
so
true
she
remembered
it
all
just
as
distinctly
as
if
she
were
still
living
in
the
midst
of
it
she
argued
with
herself
that
since
she
was
going
into
the
country
anyway
perhaps
she
ought
to
make
a
little
trip
to
the
old
homestead
that
she
might
see
it
again
before
writing
about
it
she
had
not
been
there
in
many
years
and
did
not
think
it
half
bad
to
have
a
reason
for
the
journey
in
fact
she
had
always
longed
to
be
there
no
matter
in
what
part
of
the
world
she
happened
to
be
she
had
seen
many
places
that
were
more
pretentious
and
prettier
but
nowhere
could
she
find
such
comfort
and
protection
as
in
the
home
of
her
childhood
it
was
not
such
an
easy
matter
for
her
to
go
home
as
one
might
think
for
the
estate
had
been
sold
to
people
she
did
not
know
she
felt
to
be
sure
that
they
would
receive
her
well
but
she
did
not
care
to
go
to
the
old
place
to
sit
and
talk
with
strangers
for
she
wanted
to
recall
how
it
had
been
in
times
gone
by
that
was
why
she
planned
it
so
as
to
arrive
there
late
in
the
evening
when
the
day
work
was
done
and
the
people
were
indoors
she
had
never
imagined
that
it
would
be
so
wonderful
to
come
home
as
she
sat
in
the
cart
and
drove
toward
the
old
homestead
she
fancied
that
she
was
growing
younger
and
younger
every
minute
and
that
soon
she
would
no
longer
be
an
oldish
person
with
hair
that
was
turning
gray
but
a
little
girl
in
short
skirts
with
a
long
flaxen
braid
as
she
recognized
each
farm
along
the
road
she
could
not
picture
anything
else
than
that
everything
at
home
would
be
as
in
bygone
days
her
father
and
mother
and
brothers
and
sisters
would
be
standing
on
the
porch
to
welcome
her
the
old
housekeeper
would
run
to
the
kitchen
window
to
see
who
was
coming
and
nero
and
freja
and
another
dog
or
two
would
come
bounding
and
jumping
up
on
her
the
nearer
she
approached
the
place
the
happier
she
felt
it
was
autumn
which
meant
a
busy
time
with
a
round
of
duties
it
must
have
been
all
these
varying
duties
which
prevented
home
from
ever
being
monotonous
all
along
the
way
the
farmers
were
digging
potatoes
and
probably
they
would
be
doing
likewise
at
her
home
that
meant
that
they
must
begin
immediately
to
grate
potatoes
and
make
potato
flour
the
autumn
had
been
a
mild
one
she
wondered
if
everything
in
the
garden
had
already
been
stored
the
cabbages
were
still
out
but
perhaps
the
hops
had
been
picked
and
all
the
apples
it
would
be
well
if
they
were
not
having
house
cleaning
at
home
autumn
fair
time
was
drawing
nigh
everywhere
the
cleaning
and
scouring
had
to
be
done
before
the
fair
opened
that
was
regarded
as
a
great
event
more
especially
by
the
servants
it
was
a
pleasure
to
go
into
the
kitchen
on
market
eve
and
see
the
newly
scoured
floor
strewn
with
juniper
twigs
the
whitewashed
walls
and
the
shining
copper
utensils
which
were
suspended
from
the
ceiling
even
after
the
fair
festivities
were
over
there
would
not
be
much
of
a
breathing
spell
for
then
came
the
work
on
the
flax
during
dog
days
the
flax
had
been
spread
out
on
a
meadow
to
mould
now
it
was
laid
in
the
old
bath
house
where
the
stove
was
lighted
to
dry
it
out
when
it
was
dry
enough
to
handle
all
the
women
in
the
neighbourhood
were
called
together
they
sat
outside
the
bath
house
and
picked
the
flax
to
pieces
then
they
beat
it
with
swingles
to
separate
the
fine
white
fibres
from
the
dry
stems
as
they
worked
the
women
grew
gray
with
dust
their
hair
and
clothing
were
covered
with
flax
seed
but
they
did
not
seem
to
mind
it
all
day
the
swingles
pounded
and
the
chatter
went
on
so
that
when
one
went
near
the
old
bath
house
it
sounded
as
if
a
blustering
storm
had
broken
loose
there
after
the
work
with
the
flax
came
the
big
baking
the
sheep
shearing
and
the
servants
moving
time
in
november
there
were
busy
slaughter
days
with
salting
of
meats
sausage
making
baking
of
blood
pudding
and
candle
steeping
the
seamstress
who
used
to
make
up
their
homespun
dresses
had
to
come
at
this
time
of
course
and
those
were
always
two
pleasant
weeks
when
the
women
folk
sat
together
and
busied
themselves
with
sewing
the
cobbler
who
made
shoes
for
the
entire
household
sat
working
at
the
same
time
in
the
quarters
and
one
never
tired
of
watching
him
as
he
cut
the
leather
and
soled
and
heeled
the
shoes
and
put
eyelets
in
the
shoestring
holes
but
the
greatest
rush
came
around
christmas
time
lucia
day
when
the
housemaid
went
about
dressed
in
white
with
candles
in
her
hair
and
served
coffee
to
everybody
at
five
in
the
morning
came
as
a
sort
of
reminder
that
for
the
next
two
weeks
they
could
not
count
on
much
sleep
for
now
they
must
brew
the
christmas
ale
steep
the
christmas
fish
in
lye
and
do
their
christmas
baking
and
christmas
scouring
she
was
in
the
middle
of
the
baking
with
pans
of
christmas
buns
and
cooky
platters
all
around
her
when
the
driver
drew
in
the
reins
at
the
end
of
the
lane
as
she
had
requested
she
started
like
one
suddenly
awakened
from
a
sound
sleep
it
was
dismal
for
her
who
had
just
dreamed
herself
surrounded
by
all
her
people
to
be
sitting
alone
in
the
late
evening
as
she
stepped
from
the
wagon
and
started
to
walk
up
the
long
lane
that
she
might
come
unobserved
to
her
old
home
she
felt
so
keenly
the
contrast
between
then
and
now
that
she
would
have
preferred
to
turn
back
of
what
use
is
it
to
come
here
she
sighed
it
ca
be
the
same
as
in
the
old
days
on
the
other
hand
she
felt
that
since
she
had
travelled
such
a
long
distance
she
would
see
the
place
at
all
events
so
continued
to
walk
on
although
she
was
more
depressed
with
every
step
that
she
took
she
had
heard
that
it
was
very
much
changed
and
it
certainly
was
but
she
did
not
observe
this
now
in
the
evening
she
thought
rather
that
everything
was
quite
the
same
there
was
the
pond
which
in
her
youth
had
been
full
of
carp
and
where
no
one
dared
fish
because
it
was
father
wish
that
the
carp
should
be
left
in
peace
over
there
were
the
quarters
the
larder
and
barn
with
the
farm
yard
bell
over
one
gable
and
the
over
the
other
the
house
yard
was
like
a
circular
room
with
no
outlook
in
any
direction
as
it
had
been
in
her
father
time
for
he
had
not
the
heart
to
cut
down
as
much
as
a
bush
she
lingered
in
the
shadow
under
the
big
at
the
entrance
to
the
farm
and
stood
looking
about
her
as
she
stood
there
a
strange
thing
happened
a
flock
of
doves
came
and
lit
beside
her
she
could
hardly
believe
that
they
were
real
birds
for
doves
are
not
in
the
habit
of
moving
about
after
sundown
it
must
have
been
the
beautiful
moonlight
that
had
awakened
these
they
must
have
thought
it
was
dawn
and
flown
from
their
only
to
become
confused
hardly
knowing
where
they
were
when
they
saw
a
human
being
they
flew
over
to
her
as
if
she
would
set
them
right
there
had
been
many
flocks
of
doves
at
the
manor
when
her
parents
lived
there
for
the
doves
were
among
the
creatures
which
her
father
had
taken
under
his
special
care
if
one
ever
mentioned
the
killing
of
a
dove
it
put
him
in
a
bad
humour
she
was
pleased
that
the
pretty
birds
had
come
to
meet
her
in
the
old
home
who
could
tell
but
the
doves
had
flown
out
in
the
night
to
show
her
they
had
not
forgotten
that
once
upon
a
time
they
had
a
good
home
there
perhaps
her
father
had
sent
his
birds
with
a
greeting
to
her
so
that
she
would
not
feel
so
sad
and
lonely
when
she
came
to
her
former
home
as
she
thought
of
this
there
welled
up
within
her
such
an
intense
longing
for
the
old
times
that
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
life
had
been
beautiful
in
this
place
they
had
had
weeks
of
work
broken
by
many
holiday
festivities
they
had
toiled
hard
all
day
but
at
evening
they
had
gathered
around
the
lamp
and
read
tegner
and
runeberg
lenngren
and
bremer
they
had
cultivated
grain
but
also
roses
and
jasmine
they
had
spun
flax
but
had
sung
as
they
spun
they
had
worked
hard
at
their
history
and
grammar
but
they
had
also
played
theatre
and
written
verses
they
had
stood
at
the
kitchen
stove
and
prepared
food
but
had
learned
also
to
play
the
flute
and
guitar
the
violin
and
piano
they
had
planted
cabbages
and
turnips
peas
and
beans
in
one
garden
but
they
had
another
full
of
apples
and
pears
and
all
kinds
of
berries
they
had
lived
by
themselves
and
this
was
why
so
many
stories
and
legends
were
stowed
away
in
their
memories
they
had
worn
homespun
clothes
but
they
had
also
been
able
to
lead
and
independent
lives
nowhere
else
in
the
world
do
they
know
how
to
get
so
much
out
of
life
as
they
did
at
one
of
these
little
homesteads
in
my
childhood
she
thought
there
was
just
enough
work
and
just
enough
play
and
every
day
there
was
a
joy
how
i
should
love
to
come
back
here
again
now
that
i
have
seen
the
place
it
is
hard
to
leave
it
then
she
turned
to
the
flock
of
doves
and
said
to
them
laughing
at
herself
all
the
while
wo
you
fly
to
father
and
tell
him
that
i
long
to
come
home
i
have
wandered
long
enough
in
strange
places
ask
him
if
he
ca
arrange
it
so
that
i
may
soon
turn
back
to
my
childhood
home
the
moment
she
had
said
this
the
flock
of
doves
rose
and
flew
away
she
tried
to
follow
them
with
her
eyes
but
they
vanished
instantly
it
was
as
if
the
whole
white
company
had
dissolved
in
the
shimmering
air
the
doves
had
only
just
gone
when
she
heard
a
couple
of
piercing
cries
from
the
garden
and
as
she
hastened
thither
she
saw
a
singular
sight
there
stood
a
tiny
midget
no
taller
than
a
hand
breadth
struggling
with
a
brown
owl
at
first
she
was
so
astonished
that
she
could
not
move
but
when
the
midget
cried
more
and
more
pitifully
she
stepped
up
quickly
and
parted
the
fighters
the
owl
swung
herself
into
a
tree
but
the
midget
stood
on
the
gravel
path
without
attempting
either
to
hide
or
to
run
away
thanks
for
your
help
he
said
but
it
was
very
stupid
of
you
to
let
the
owl
escape
i
ca
get
away
from
here
because
she
is
sitting
up
in
the
tree
watching
me
it
was
thoughtless
of
me
to
let
her
go
but
to
make
amends
ca
i
accompany
you
to
your
home
asked
she
who
wrote
stories
somewhat
surprised
to
think
that
in
this
unexpected
fashion
she
had
got
into
conversation
with
one
of
the
tiny
folk
still
she
was
not
so
much
surprised
after
all
it
was
as
if
all
the
while
she
had
been
awaiting
some
extraordinary
experience
while
she
walked
in
the
moonlight
outside
her
old
home
the
fact
is
i
had
thought
of
stopping
here
over
night
said
the
midget
if
you
will
only
show
me
a
safe
sleeping
place
i
shall
not
be
obliged
to
return
to
the
forest
before
daybreak
must
i
show
you
a
place
to
sleep
are
you
not
at
home
here
i
understand
that
you
take
me
for
one
of
the
tiny
folk
said
the
midget
but
i
a
human
being
like
yourself
although
i
have
been
transformed
by
an
elf
that
is
the
most
remarkable
thing
i
have
ever
heard
would
you
like
to
tell
me
how
you
happened
to
get
into
such
a
plight
the
boy
did
not
mind
telling
her
of
his
adventures
and
as
the
narrative
proceeded
she
who
listened
to
him
grew
more
and
more
astonished
and
happy
what
luck
to
run
across
one
who
has
travelled
all
over
sweden
on
the
back
of
a
goose
thought
she
just
this
which
he
is
relating
i
shall
write
down
in
my
book
now
i
need
worry
no
more
over
that
matter
it
was
well
that
i
came
home
to
think
that
i
should
find
such
help
as
soon
as
i
came
to
the
old
place
instantly
another
thought
flashed
into
her
mind
she
had
sent
word
to
her
father
by
the
doves
that
she
longed
for
home
and
almost
immediately
she
had
received
help
in
the
matter
she
had
pondered
so
long
might
not
this
be
the
father
answer
to
her
prayer
the
treasure
on
the
island
on
their
way
to
the
sea
october
from
the
very
start
of
the
autumn
trip
the
wild
geese
had
flown
straight
south
but
when
they
left
fryksdalen
they
veered
in
another
direction
travelling
over
western
vermland
and
dalsland
toward
bohuslän
that
was
a
jolly
trip
the
goslings
were
now
so
used
to
flying
that
they
complained
no
more
of
fatigue
and
the
boy
was
fast
recovering
his
good
humour
he
was
glad
that
he
had
talked
with
a
human
being
he
felt
encouraged
when
she
said
to
him
that
if
he
were
to
continue
doing
good
to
all
whom
he
met
as
heretofore
it
could
not
end
badly
for
him
she
was
not
able
to
tell
him
how
to
get
back
his
natural
form
but
she
had
given
him
a
little
hope
and
assurance
which
inspired
the
boy
to
think
out
a
way
to
prevent
the
big
white
gander
from
going
home
do
you
know
morten
that
it
will
be
rather
monotonous
for
us
to
stay
at
home
all
winter
after
having
been
on
a
trip
like
this
he
said
as
they
were
flying
far
up
in
the
air
i
sitting
here
thinking
that
we
ought
to
go
abroad
with
the
geese
surely
you
are
not
in
earnest
said
the
since
he
had
proved
to
the
wild
geese
his
ability
to
travel
with
them
all
the
way
to
lapland
he
was
perfectly
satisfied
to
get
back
to
the
goose
pen
in
holger
nilsson
cow
shed
the
boy
sat
silently
a
while
and
gazed
down
on
vermland
where
the
birch
woods
leafy
groves
and
gardens
were
clad
in
red
and
yellow
autumn
colours
i
do
think
i
ever
seen
the
earth
beneath
us
as
lovely
as
it
is
he
finally
remarked
the
lakes
are
like
blue
satin
bands
do
you
think
it
would
be
a
pity
to
settle
down
in
west
vemminghög
and
never
see
any
more
of
the
world
i
thought
you
wanted
to
go
home
to
your
mother
and
father
and
show
them
what
a
splendid
boy
you
had
become
said
the
all
summer
he
had
been
dreaming
of
what
a
proud
moment
it
would
be
for
him
when
he
should
alight
in
the
house
yard
before
holger
cabin
and
show
dunfin
and
the
six
goslings
to
the
geese
and
chickens
the
cows
and
the
cat
and
to
mother
holger
nilsson
herself
so
that
he
was
not
very
happy
over
the
boy
proposal
now
morten
do
you
think
yourself
that
it
would
be
hard
never
to
see
anything
more
that
is
beautiful
said
the
boy
i
would
rather
see
the
fat
grain
fields
of
söderslätt
than
these
lean
hills
answered
the
but
you
must
know
very
well
that
if
you
really
wish
to
continue
the
trip
i
ca
be
parted
from
you
that
is
just
the
answer
i
had
expected
from
you
said
the
boy
and
his
voice
betrayed
that
he
was
relieved
of
a
great
anxiety
later
when
they
travelled
over
bohuslän
the
boy
observed
that
the
mountain
stretches
were
more
continuous
the
valleys
were
more
like
little
ravines
blasted
in
the
rock
foundation
while
the
long
lakes
at
their
base
were
as
black
as
if
they
had
come
from
the
underworld
this
too
was
a
glorious
country
and
as
the
boy
saw
it
with
now
a
strip
of
sun
now
a
shadow
he
thought
that
there
was
something
strange
and
wild
about
it
he
knew
not
why
but
the
idea
came
to
him
that
once
upon
a
time
there
were
many
strong
and
brave
heroes
in
these
mystical
regions
who
had
passed
through
many
dangerous
and
daring
adventures
the
old
passion
of
wanting
to
share
in
all
sorts
of
wonderful
adventures
awoke
in
him
i
might
possibly
miss
not
being
in
danger
of
my
life
at
least
once
every
day
or
two
he
thought
anyhow
it
best
to
be
content
with
things
as
they
are
he
did
not
speak
of
this
idea
to
the
big
white
gander
because
the
geese
were
now
flying
over
bohuslän
with
all
the
speed
they
could
muster
and
the
was
puffing
so
hard
that
he
would
not
have
had
the
strength
to
reply
the
sun
was
far
down
on
the
horizon
and
disappeared
every
now
and
then
behind
a
hill
still
the
geese
kept
forging
ahead
finally
in
the
west
they
saw
a
shining
strip
of
light
which
grew
broader
and
broader
with
every
wing
stroke
soon
the
sea
spread
before
them
milk
white
with
a
shimmer
of
rose
red
and
sky
blue
and
when
they
had
circled
past
the
coast
cliffs
they
saw
the
sun
again
as
it
hung
over
the
sea
big
and
red
and
ready
to
plunge
into
the
waves
as
the
boy
gazed
at
the
broad
endless
sea
and
the
red
evening
sun
which
had
such
a
kindly
glow
that
he
dared
to
look
straight
at
it
he
felt
a
sense
of
peace
and
calm
penetrate
his
soul
it
not
worth
while
to
be
sad
nils
holgersson
said
the
sun
this
is
a
beautiful
world
to
live
in
both
for
big
and
little
it
is
also
good
to
be
free
and
happy
and
to
have
a
great
dome
of
open
sky
above
you
the
gift
of
the
wild
geese
the
geese
stood
sleeping
on
a
little
rock
islet
just
beyond
fjällbacka
when
it
drew
on
toward
midnight
and
the
moon
hung
high
in
the
heavens
old
akka
shook
the
sleepiness
out
of
her
eyes
after
that
she
walked
around
and
awakened
yksi
and
kaksi
kolme
and
neljä
viisi
and
kuusi
and
last
of
all
she
gave
thumbietot
a
nudge
with
her
bill
that
startled
him
what
is
it
mother
akka
he
asked
springing
up
in
alarm
nothing
serious
assured
the
it
just
this
we
seven
who
have
been
long
together
want
to
fly
a
short
distance
out
to
sea
and
we
wondered
if
you
would
care
to
come
with
us
the
boy
knew
that
akka
would
not
have
proposed
this
move
had
there
not
been
something
important
on
foot
so
he
promptly
seated
himself
on
her
back
the
flight
was
straight
west
the
wild
geese
first
flew
over
a
belt
of
large
and
small
islands
near
the
coast
then
over
a
broad
expanse
of
open
sea
till
they
reached
the
large
cluster
known
as
the
väder
islands
all
of
them
were
low
and
rocky
and
in
the
moonlight
one
could
see
that
they
were
rather
large
akka
looked
at
one
of
the
smallest
islands
and
alighted
there
it
consisted
of
a
round
gray
stone
hill
with
a
wide
cleft
across
it
into
which
the
sea
had
cast
fine
white
sea
sand
and
a
few
shells
as
the
boy
slid
from
the
goose
back
he
noticed
something
quite
close
to
him
that
looked
like
a
jagged
stone
but
almost
at
once
he
saw
that
it
was
a
big
vulture
which
had
chosen
the
rock
island
for
a
night
harbour
before
the
boy
had
time
to
wonder
at
the
geese
recklessly
alighting
so
near
a
dangerous
enemy
the
bird
flew
up
to
them
and
the
boy
recognized
gorgo
the
eagle
evidently
akka
and
gorgo
had
arranged
the
meeting
for
neither
of
them
was
taken
by
surprise
this
was
good
of
you
gorgo
said
akka
i
did
expect
that
you
would
be
at
the
meeting
place
ahead
of
us
have
you
been
here
long
i
came
early
in
the
evening
replied
gorgo
but
i
fear
that
the
only
praise
i
deserve
is
for
keeping
my
appointment
with
you
i
not
been
very
successful
in
carrying
out
the
orders
you
gave
me
i
sure
gorgo
that
you
have
done
more
than
you
care
to
admit
assured
akka
but
before
you
relate
your
experiences
on
the
trip
i
shall
ask
thumbietot
to
help
me
find
something
which
is
supposed
to
be
buried
on
this
island
the
boy
stood
gazing
admiringly
at
two
beautiful
shells
but
when
akka
spoke
his
name
he
glanced
up
you
must
have
wondered
thumbietot
why
we
turned
out
of
our
course
to
fly
here
to
the
west
sea
said
akka
to
be
frank
i
did
think
it
strange
answered
the
boy
but
i
knew
of
course
that
you
always
have
some
good
reason
for
whatever
you
do
you
have
a
good
opinion
of
me
returned
akka
but
i
almost
fear
you
will
lose
it
now
for
it
very
probable
that
we
have
made
this
journey
in
vain
many
years
ago
it
happened
that
two
of
the
other
old
geese
and
myself
encountered
frightful
storms
during
a
spring
flight
and
were
to
this
island
when
we
discovered
that
there
was
only
open
sea
before
us
we
feared
we
should
be
swept
so
far
out
that
we
should
never
find
our
way
back
to
land
so
we
lay
down
on
the
waves
between
these
bare
cliffs
where
the
storm
compelled
us
to
remain
for
several
days
we
suffered
terribly
from
hunger
once
we
ventured
up
to
the
cleft
on
this
island
in
search
of
food
we
could
find
a
green
blade
but
we
saw
a
number
of
securely
tied
bags
half
buried
in
the
sand
we
hoped
to
find
grain
in
the
bags
and
pulled
and
tugged
at
them
till
we
tore
the
cloth
however
no
grain
poured
out
but
shining
gold
pieces
for
such
things
we
wild
geese
had
no
use
so
we
left
them
where
they
were
we
have
thought
of
the
find
in
all
these
years
but
this
autumn
something
has
come
up
to
make
us
wish
for
gold
we
do
not
know
that
the
treasure
is
still
here
but
we
have
travelled
all
this
way
to
ask
you
to
look
into
the
matter
with
a
shell
in
either
hand
the
boy
jumped
down
into
the
cleft
and
began
to
scoop
up
the
sand
he
found
no
bags
but
when
he
had
made
a
deep
hole
he
heard
the
clink
of
metal
and
saw
that
he
had
come
upon
a
gold
piece
then
he
dug
with
his
fingers
and
felt
many
coins
in
the
sand
so
he
hurried
back
to
akka
the
bags
have
rotted
and
fallen
apart
he
exclaimed
and
the
money
lies
scattered
all
through
the
sand
that
well
said
akka
now
fill
in
the
hole
and
smooth
it
over
so
no
one
will
notice
the
sand
has
been
disturbed
the
boy
did
as
he
was
told
but
when
he
came
up
from
the
cleft
he
was
astonished
to
see
that
the
wild
geese
were
lined
up
with
akka
in
the
lead
and
were
marching
toward
him
with
great
solemnity
the
geese
paused
in
front
of
him
and
all
bowed
their
heads
many
times
looking
so
grave
that
he
had
to
doff
his
cap
and
make
an
obeisance
to
them
the
fact
is
said
akka
we
old
geese
have
been
thinking
that
if
thumbietot
had
been
in
the
service
of
human
beings
and
had
done
as
much
for
them
as
he
has
for
us
they
would
not
let
him
go
without
rewarding
him
well
i
have
helped
you
it
is
you
who
have
taken
good
care
of
me
returned
the
boy
we
think
also
continued
akka
that
when
a
human
being
has
attended
us
on
a
whole
journey
he
should
be
allowed
to
leave
us
as
poor
as
when
he
came
i
know
that
what
i
have
learned
this
year
with
you
is
worth
more
to
me
than
gold
or
lands
said
the
boy
since
these
gold
coins
have
been
lying
unclaimed
in
the
cleft
all
these
years
i
think
that
you
ought
to
have
them
declared
the
wild
goose
i
thought
you
said
something
about
needing
this
money
yourselves
reminded
the
boy
we
do
need
it
so
as
to
be
able
to
give
you
such
recompense
as
will
make
your
mother
and
father
think
you
have
been
working
as
a
goose
boy
with
worthy
people
the
boy
turned
half
round
and
cast
a
glance
toward
the
sea
then
faced
about
and
looked
straight
into
akka
bright
eyes
i
think
it
strange
mother
akka
that
you
turn
me
away
from
your
service
like
this
and
pay
me
off
before
i
have
given
you
notice
he
said
as
long
as
we
wild
geese
remain
in
sweden
i
trust
that
you
will
stay
with
us
said
akka
i
only
wanted
to
show
you
where
the
treasure
was
while
we
could
get
to
it
without
going
too
far
out
of
our
course
all
the
same
it
looks
as
if
you
wished
to
be
rid
of
me
before
i
want
to
go
argued
thumbietot
after
all
the
good
times
we
have
had
together
i
think
you
ought
to
let
me
go
abroad
with
you
when
the
boy
said
this
akka
and
the
other
wild
geese
stretched
their
long
necks
straight
up
and
stood
a
moment
with
bills
half
open
drinking
in
air
that
is
something
i
have
thought
about
said
akka
when
she
recovered
herself
before
you
decide
to
come
with
us
we
had
better
hear
what
gorgo
has
to
say
you
may
as
well
know
that
when
we
left
lapland
the
agreement
between
gorgo
and
myself
was
that
he
should
travel
to
your
home
down
in
skåne
to
try
to
make
better
terms
for
you
with
the
elf
that
is
true
affirmed
gorgo
but
as
i
have
already
told
you
luck
was
against
me
i
soon
hunted
up
holger
nilsson
croft
and
after
circling
up
and
down
over
the
place
a
couple
of
hours
i
caught
sight
of
the
elf
skulking
along
between
the
sheds
immediately
i
swooped
down
upon
him
and
flew
off
with
him
to
a
meadow
where
we
could
talk
together
without
interruption
i
told
him
that
i
had
been
sent
by
akka
from
kebnekaise
to
ask
if
he
could
give
nils
holgersson
easier
terms
only
wish
i
could
he
answered
i
have
heard
that
he
has
conducted
himself
well
on
the
trip
but
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
do
so
then
i
was
wrathy
and
said
that
i
would
bore
out
his
eyes
unless
he
gave
in
may
do
as
you
like
he
retorted
as
to
nils
holgersson
it
will
turn
out
exactly
as
i
have
said
you
can
tell
him
from
me
that
he
would
do
well
to
return
soon
with
his
goose
for
matters
on
the
farm
are
in
a
bad
shape
his
father
has
had
to
forfeit
a
bond
for
his
brother
whom
he
trusted
he
has
bought
a
horse
with
borrowed
money
and
the
beast
went
lame
the
first
time
he
drove
it
since
then
it
has
been
of
no
earthly
use
to
him
tell
nils
holgersson
that
his
parents
have
had
to
sell
two
of
the
cows
and
that
they
must
give
up
the
croft
unless
they
receive
help
from
somewhere
when
the
boy
heard
this
he
frowned
and
clenched
his
fists
so
hard
that
the
nails
dug
into
his
flesh
it
is
cruel
of
the
elf
to
make
the
conditions
so
hard
for
me
that
i
can
not
go
home
and
relieve
my
parents
but
he
turn
me
into
a
traitor
to
a
friend
my
father
and
mother
are
square
and
upright
folk
i
know
they
would
rather
forfeit
my
help
than
have
me
come
back
to
them
with
a
guilty
conscience
the
journey
to
vemminghög
november
one
day
in
the
beginning
of
november
the
wild
geese
flew
over
halland
ridge
and
into
skåne
for
several
weeks
they
had
been
resting
on
the
wide
plains
around
falköping
as
many
other
wild
goose
flocks
also
stopped
there
the
grown
geese
had
had
a
pleasant
time
visiting
with
old
friends
and
there
had
been
all
kinds
of
games
and
races
between
the
younger
birds
nils
holgersson
had
not
been
happy
over
the
delay
in
westergötland
he
had
tried
to
keep
a
stout
heart
but
it
was
hard
for
him
to
reconcile
himself
to
his
fate
if
i
were
only
well
out
of
skåne
and
in
some
foreign
land
he
had
thought
i
should
know
for
certain
that
i
had
nothing
to
hope
for
and
would
feel
easier
in
my
mind
finally
one
morning
the
geese
started
out
and
flew
toward
halland
in
the
beginning
the
boy
took
very
little
interest
in
that
province
he
thought
there
was
nothing
new
to
be
seen
there
but
when
the
wild
geese
continued
the
journey
farther
south
along
the
narrow
the
boy
leaned
over
the
goose
neck
and
did
not
take
his
glance
from
the
ground
he
saw
the
hills
gradually
disappear
and
the
plain
spread
under
him
at
the
same
time
he
noticed
that
the
coast
became
less
rugged
while
the
group
of
islands
beyond
thinned
and
finally
vanished
and
the
broad
open
sea
came
clear
up
to
firm
land
here
there
were
no
more
forests
here
the
plain
was
supreme
it
spread
all
the
way
to
the
horizon
a
land
that
lay
so
exposed
with
field
upon
field
reminded
the
boy
of
skåne
he
felt
both
happy
and
sad
as
he
looked
at
it
i
ca
be
very
far
from
home
he
thought
many
times
during
the
trip
the
goslings
had
asked
the
old
geese
how
does
it
look
in
foreign
lands
wait
wait
you
shall
soon
see
the
old
geese
had
answered
when
the
wild
geese
had
passed
halland
ridge
and
gone
a
distance
into
skåne
akka
called
out
now
look
down
look
all
around
it
is
like
this
in
foreign
lands
just
then
they
flew
over
söder
ridge
the
whole
long
range
of
hills
was
clad
in
beech
woods
and
beautiful
turreted
castles
peeped
out
here
and
there
among
the
trees
grazed
and
on
the
forest
meadow
romped
the
hares
hunters
horns
sounded
from
the
forests
the
loud
baying
of
dogs
could
be
heard
all
the
way
up
to
the
wild
geese
broad
avenues
wound
through
the
trees
and
on
these
ladies
and
gentlemen
were
driving
in
polished
carriages
or
riding
fine
horses
at
the
foot
of
the
ridge
lay
ring
lake
with
the
ancient
bosjö
cloister
on
a
narrow
peninsula
does
it
look
like
this
in
foreign
lands
asked
the
goslings
it
looks
exactly
like
this
wherever
there
are
ridges
replied
akka
only
one
does
see
many
of
them
wait
you
shall
see
how
it
looks
in
general
akka
led
the
geese
farther
south
to
the
great
skåne
plain
there
it
spread
with
grain
fields
with
acres
and
acres
of
sugar
beets
where
the
were
at
work
with
low
whitewashed
and
outhouses
with
numberless
little
white
churches
with
ugly
gray
sugar
refineries
and
small
villages
near
the
railway
stations
little
meadow
lakes
each
of
them
adorned
by
its
own
stately
manor
shimmered
here
and
there
now
look
down
look
carefully
called
the
thus
it
is
in
foreign
lands
from
the
baltic
coast
all
the
way
down
to
the
high
alps
farther
than
that
i
have
never
travelled
when
the
goslings
had
seen
the
plain
the
flew
down
the
öresund
coast
swampy
meadows
sloped
gradually
toward
the
sea
in
some
places
were
high
steep
banks
in
others
fields
where
the
sand
lay
heaped
in
banks
and
hills
fishing
hamlets
stood
all
along
the
coast
with
long
rows
of
low
uniform
brick
houses
with
a
lighthouse
at
the
edge
of
the
breakwater
and
brown
fishing
nets
hanging
in
the
drying
yard
now
look
down
look
well
this
is
how
it
looks
along
the
coasts
in
foreign
lands
after
akka
had
been
flying
about
in
this
manner
a
long
time
she
alighted
suddenly
on
a
marsh
in
vemminghög
township
and
the
boy
could
not
help
thinking
that
she
had
travelled
over
skåne
just
to
let
him
see
that
his
was
a
country
which
could
compare
favourably
with
any
in
the
world
this
was
unnecessary
for
the
boy
was
not
thinking
of
whether
the
country
was
rich
or
poor
from
the
moment
that
he
had
seen
the
first
willow
grove
his
heart
ached
with
homesickness
home
at
last
november
the
atmosphere
was
dull
and
hazy
the
wild
geese
had
been
feeding
on
the
big
meadow
around
skerup
church
and
were
having
their
noonday
rest
when
akka
came
up
to
the
boy
it
looks
as
if
we
should
have
calm
weather
for
awhile
she
remarked
and
i
think
we
cross
the
baltic
indeed
said
the
boy
abruptly
for
his
throat
contracted
so
that
he
could
hardly
speak
all
along
he
had
cherished
the
hope
that
he
would
be
released
from
the
enchantment
while
he
was
still
in
skåne
we
are
quite
near
west
vemminghög
now
said
akka
and
i
thought
that
perhaps
you
might
like
to
go
home
for
awhile
it
may
be
some
time
before
you
have
another
opportunity
to
see
your
people
perhaps
i
had
better
not
said
the
boy
hesitatingly
but
something
in
his
voice
betrayed
that
he
was
glad
of
akka
proposal
if
the
remains
with
us
no
harm
can
come
to
him
akka
assured
i
think
you
had
better
find
out
how
your
parents
are
getting
along
you
might
be
of
some
help
to
them
even
if
you
not
a
normal
boy
you
are
right
mother
akka
i
should
have
thought
of
that
long
ago
said
the
boy
impulsively
the
next
second
he
and
the
were
on
their
way
to
his
home
it
was
not
long
before
akka
alighted
behind
the
stone
hedge
encircling
the
little
farm
strange
how
natural
everything
looks
around
here
the
boy
remarked
quickly
clambering
to
the
top
of
the
hedge
so
that
he
could
look
about
it
seems
to
me
only
yesterday
that
i
first
saw
you
come
flying
through
the
air
i
wonder
if
your
father
has
a
gun
said
akka
suddenly
you
may
be
sure
he
has
returned
the
boy
it
was
just
the
gun
that
kept
me
at
home
that
sunday
morning
when
i
should
have
been
at
church
then
i
do
dare
to
stand
here
and
wait
for
you
said
akka
you
had
better
meet
us
at
smygahök
early
morning
so
that
you
may
stay
at
home
over
night
oh
do
go
yet
mother
akka
begged
the
boy
jumping
from
the
hedge
he
could
not
tell
just
why
it
was
but
he
felt
as
if
something
would
happen
either
to
the
wild
goose
or
to
himself
to
prevent
their
future
meeting
no
doubt
you
see
that
i
distressed
because
i
can
not
get
back
my
right
form
but
i
want
to
say
to
you
that
i
do
regret
having
gone
with
you
last
spring
he
added
i
would
rather
forfeit
the
chance
of
ever
being
human
again
than
to
have
missed
that
trip
akka
breathed
quickly
before
she
answered
there
a
little
matter
i
should
have
mentioned
to
you
before
this
but
since
you
are
not
going
back
to
your
home
for
good
i
thought
there
was
no
hurry
about
it
still
it
may
as
well
be
said
now
you
know
very
well
that
i
am
always
glad
to
do
your
bidding
said
the
boy
if
you
have
learned
anything
at
all
from
us
thumbietot
you
no
longer
think
that
the
humans
should
have
the
whole
earth
to
themselves
said
the
wild
goose
solemnly
remember
you
have
a
large
country
and
you
can
easily
afford
to
leave
a
few
bare
rocks
a
few
shallow
lakes
and
swamps
a
few
desolate
cliffs
and
remote
forests
to
us
poor
dumb
creatures
where
we
can
be
allowed
to
live
in
peace
all
my
days
i
have
been
hounded
and
hunted
it
would
be
a
comfort
to
know
that
there
is
a
refuge
somewhere
for
one
like
me
indeed
i
should
be
glad
to
help
if
i
could
said
the
boy
but
not
likely
that
i
shall
ever
again
have
any
influence
among
human
beings
well
we
standing
here
talking
as
if
we
were
never
to
meet
again
said
akka
but
we
shall
see
each
other
of
course
now
return
to
my
flock
she
spread
her
wings
and
started
to
fly
but
came
back
and
stroked
thumbietot
up
and
down
with
her
bill
before
she
flew
away
it
was
broad
daylight
but
no
human
being
moved
on
the
farm
and
the
boy
could
go
where
he
pleased
he
hastened
to
the
cow
shed
because
he
knew
that
he
could
get
the
best
information
from
the
cows
it
looked
rather
barren
in
their
shed
in
the
spring
there
had
been
three
fine
cows
there
but
now
there
was
only
one
mayrose
it
was
quite
apparent
that
she
yearned
for
her
comrades
her
head
drooped
sadly
and
she
had
hardly
touched
the
feed
in
her
crib
good
day
mayrose
said
the
boy
running
fearlessly
into
her
stall
how
are
mother
and
father
how
are
the
cat
and
the
chickens
what
has
become
of
star
and
when
mayrose
heard
the
boy
voice
she
started
and
appeared
as
if
she
were
going
to
gore
him
but
she
was
not
so
now
as
formerly
and
took
time
to
look
well
at
nils
holgersson
he
was
just
as
little
now
as
when
he
went
away
and
wore
the
same
clothes
yet
he
was
completely
changed
the
nils
holgersson
that
went
away
in
the
spring
had
a
heavy
slow
gait
a
drawling
speech
and
sleepy
eyes
the
one
that
had
come
back
was
lithe
and
alert
ready
of
speech
and
had
eyes
that
sparkled
and
danced
he
had
a
confident
bearing
that
commanded
respect
little
as
he
was
although
he
himself
did
not
look
happy
he
inspired
happiness
in
others
moo
bellowed
mayrose
they
told
me
that
he
was
changed
but
i
could
believe
it
welcome
home
nils
holgersson
welcome
home
this
is
the
first
glad
moment
i
have
known
for
ever
so
long
thank
you
mayrose
said
the
boy
who
was
very
happy
to
be
so
well
received
now
tell
me
all
about
father
and
mother
they
have
had
nothing
but
hardship
ever
since
you
went
away
said
mayrose
the
horse
has
been
a
costly
care
all
summer
for
he
has
stood
in
the
stable
the
whole
time
and
not
earned
his
feed
your
father
is
too
to
shoot
him
and
he
ca
sell
him
it
was
on
account
of
the
horse
that
both
star
and
had
to
be
sold
there
was
something
else
the
boy
wanted
badly
to
know
but
he
was
diffident
about
asking
the
question
point
blank
therefore
he
said
mother
must
have
felt
very
sorry
when
she
discovered
that
morten
had
flown
she
would
have
worried
much
about
morten
had
she
known
the
way
he
came
to
leave
she
grieves
most
at
the
thought
of
her
son
having
run
away
from
home
with
a
does
she
really
think
that
i
the
said
the
boy
what
else
could
she
think
father
and
mother
must
fancy
that
i
been
roaming
about
the
country
like
a
common
tramp
they
think
that
you
gone
to
the
dogs
said
mayrose
they
have
mourned
you
as
one
mourns
the
loss
of
the
dearest
thing
on
earth
as
soon
as
the
boy
heard
this
he
rushed
from
the
cow
shed
and
down
to
the
stable
it
was
small
but
clean
and
tidy
everything
showed
that
his
father
had
tried
to
make
the
place
comfortable
for
the
new
horse
in
the
stall
stood
a
strong
fine
animal
that
looked
well
fed
and
well
cared
for
good
day
to
you
said
the
boy
i
have
heard
that
there
a
sick
horse
in
here
surely
it
ca
be
you
who
look
so
healthy
and
strong
the
horse
turned
his
head
and
stared
fixedly
at
the
boy
are
you
the
son
he
queried
i
have
heard
many
bad
reports
of
him
but
you
have
such
a
good
face
i
could
believe
that
you
were
he
did
i
not
know
that
he
was
transformed
into
an
elf
i
know
that
i
left
a
bad
name
behind
me
when
i
went
away
from
the
farm
admitted
nils
holgersson
my
own
mother
thinks
i
am
a
thief
but
what
matters
it
i
tarry
here
long
meanwhile
i
want
to
know
what
ails
you
pity
you
not
going
to
stay
said
the
horse
for
i
have
the
feeling
that
you
and
i
might
become
good
friends
i
got
something
in
my
foot
the
point
of
a
knife
or
something
sharp
that
all
that
ails
me
it
has
gone
so
far
in
that
the
doctor
ca
find
it
but
it
cuts
so
that
i
ca
walk
if
you
would
only
tell
your
father
what
wrong
with
me
i
sure
that
he
could
help
me
i
should
like
to
be
of
some
use
i
really
feel
ashamed
to
stand
here
and
feed
without
doing
any
work
it
well
that
you
have
no
real
illness
remarked
nils
holgersson
i
must
attend
to
this
at
once
so
that
you
will
be
all
right
again
you
do
mind
if
i
do
a
little
scratching
on
your
hoof
with
my
knife
do
you
nils
holgersson
had
just
finished
when
he
heard
the
sound
of
voices
he
opened
the
stable
door
a
little
and
peeped
out
his
father
and
mother
were
coming
down
the
lane
it
was
easy
to
see
that
they
were
broken
by
many
sorrows
his
mother
had
many
lines
on
her
face
and
his
father
hair
had
turned
gray
she
was
talking
with
him
about
getting
a
loan
from
her
no
i
do
want
to
borrow
any
more
money
his
father
said
as
they
were
passing
the
stable
there
nothing
quite
so
hard
as
being
in
debt
it
would
be
better
to
sell
the
cabin
if
it
were
not
for
the
boy
i
should
mind
selling
it
his
mother
demurred
but
what
will
become
of
him
if
he
returns
some
day
wretched
and
poor
as
he
likely
to
be
and
we
not
here
you
right
about
that
the
father
agreed
but
we
shall
have
to
ask
the
folks
who
take
the
place
to
receive
him
kindly
and
to
let
him
know
that
he
welcome
back
to
us
we
say
a
harsh
word
to
him
no
matter
what
he
may
be
shall
we
mother
no
indeed
if
i
only
had
him
again
so
that
i
could
be
certain
he
is
not
starving
and
freezing
on
the
highways
i
ask
nothing
more
then
his
father
and
mother
went
in
and
the
boy
heard
no
more
of
their
conversation
he
was
happy
and
deeply
moved
when
he
knew
that
they
loved
him
so
dearly
although
they
believed
he
had
gone
astray
he
longed
to
rush
into
their
arms
but
perhaps
it
would
be
an
even
greater
sorrow
were
they
to
see
me
as
i
now
am
while
he
stood
there
hesitating
a
cart
drove
up
to
the
gate
the
boy
smothered
a
cry
of
surprise
for
who
should
step
from
the
cart
and
go
into
the
house
yard
but
osa
the
goose
girl
and
her
father
they
walked
hand
in
hand
toward
the
cabin
when
they
were
about
half
way
there
osa
stopped
her
father
and
said
now
remember
father
you
are
not
to
mention
the
wooden
shoe
or
the
geese
or
the
little
brownie
who
was
so
like
nils
holgersson
that
if
it
was
not
himself
it
must
have
had
some
connection
with
him
certainly
not
said
jon
esserson
i
shall
only
say
that
their
son
has
been
of
great
help
to
you
on
several
occasions
when
you
were
trying
to
find
me
and
that
therefore
we
have
come
to
ask
if
we
ca
do
them
a
service
in
return
since
i
a
rich
man
now
and
have
more
than
i
need
thanks
to
the
mine
i
discovered
up
in
lapland
i
know
father
that
you
can
say
the
right
thing
in
the
right
way
osa
commended
it
is
only
that
one
particular
thing
that
i
do
wish
you
to
mention
they
went
into
the
cabin
and
the
boy
would
have
liked
to
hear
what
they
talked
about
in
there
but
he
dared
not
venture
near
the
house
it
was
not
long
before
they
came
out
again
and
his
father
and
mother
accompanied
them
as
far
as
the
gate
his
parents
were
strangely
happy
they
appeared
to
have
gained
a
new
hold
on
life
when
the
visitors
were
gone
father
and
mother
lingered
at
the
gate
gazing
after
them
i
do
feel
unhappy
any
longer
since
i
heard
so
much
that
is
good
of
our
nils
said
his
mother
perhaps
he
got
more
praise
than
he
really
deserved
put
in
his
father
thoughtfully
was
it
enough
for
you
that
they
came
here
specially
to
say
they
wanted
to
help
us
because
our
nils
had
served
them
in
many
ways
i
think
father
that
you
should
have
accepted
their
offer
no
mother
i
do
wish
to
accept
money
from
any
one
either
as
a
gift
or
a
loan
in
the
first
place
i
want
to
free
myself
from
all
debt
then
we
will
work
our
way
up
again
we
not
so
very
old
are
we
mother
the
father
laughed
heartily
as
he
said
this
i
believe
you
think
it
will
be
fun
to
sell
this
place
upon
which
we
have
expended
such
a
lot
of
time
and
hard
work
protested
the
mother
oh
you
know
why
i
laughing
the
father
retorted
it
was
the
thought
of
the
boy
having
gone
to
the
bad
that
weighed
me
down
until
i
had
no
strength
or
courage
left
in
me
now
that
i
know
he
still
lives
and
has
turned
out
well
you
see
that
holger
nilsson
has
some
grit
left
the
mother
went
in
alone
and
the
boy
made
haste
to
hide
in
a
corner
for
his
father
walked
into
the
stable
he
went
over
to
the
horse
and
examined
its
hoof
as
usual
to
try
to
discover
what
was
wrong
with
it
what
this
he
cried
discovering
some
letters
scratched
on
the
hoof
remove
the
sharp
piece
of
iron
from
the
foot
he
read
and
glanced
around
inquiringly
however
he
ran
his
fingers
along
the
under
side
of
the
hoof
and
looked
at
it
carefully
i
verily
believe
there
is
something
sharp
here
he
said
while
his
father
was
busy
with
the
horse
and
the
boy
sat
huddled
in
a
corner
it
happened
that
other
callers
came
to
the
farm
the
fact
was
that
when
morten
found
himself
so
near
his
old
home
he
simply
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
showing
his
wife
and
children
to
his
old
companions
on
the
farm
so
he
took
dunfin
and
the
goslings
along
and
made
for
home
there
was
not
a
soul
in
the
barn
yard
when
the
came
along
he
alighted
confidently
walked
all
around
the
place
and
showed
dunfin
how
luxuriously
he
had
lived
when
he
was
a
tame
goose
when
they
had
viewed
the
entire
farm
he
noticed
that
the
door
of
the
cow
shed
was
open
look
in
here
a
moment
he
said
then
you
will
see
how
i
lived
in
former
days
it
was
very
different
from
camping
in
swamps
and
morasses
as
we
do
now
the
stood
in
the
doorway
and
looked
into
the
cow
shed
there
not
a
soul
in
here
he
said
come
along
dunfin
and
you
shall
see
the
goose
pen
do
be
afraid
there
no
danger
forthwith
the
dunfin
and
all
six
goslings
waddled
into
the
goose
pen
to
have
a
look
at
the
elegance
and
comfort
in
which
the
big
white
gander
had
lived
before
he
joined
the
wild
geese
this
is
the
way
it
used
to
be
here
was
my
place
and
over
there
was
the
trough
which
was
always
filled
with
oats
and
water
explained
the
wait
there
some
fodder
in
it
now
with
that
he
rushed
to
the
trough
and
began
to
gobble
up
the
oats
but
dunfin
was
nervous
let
go
out
again
she
said
only
two
more
grains
insisted
the
the
next
second
he
let
out
a
shriek
and
ran
for
the
door
but
it
was
too
late
the
door
slammed
the
mistress
stood
without
and
bolted
it
they
were
locked
in
the
father
had
removed
a
sharp
piece
of
iron
from
the
horse
hoof
and
stood
contentedly
stroking
the
animal
when
the
mother
came
running
into
the
stable
come
father
and
see
the
capture
i
made
no
wait
a
minute
said
the
father
look
here
first
i
have
discovered
what
ailed
the
horse
i
believe
our
luck
has
turned
said
the
mother
only
fancy
the
big
white
that
disappeared
last
spring
must
have
gone
off
with
the
wild
geese
he
has
come
back
to
us
in
company
with
seven
wild
geese
they
walked
straight
into
the
goose
pen
and
i
shut
them
all
in
that
extraordinary
remarked
the
father
but
best
of
all
is
that
we
do
have
to
think
any
more
that
our
boy
stole
the
when
he
went
away
you
quite
right
father
she
said
but
i
afraid
we
have
to
kill
them
in
two
days
is
morten
gooseday
and
we
must
make
haste
if
we
expect
to
get
them
to
market
in
time
footnote
in
sweden
the
of
november
is
called
morten
gooseday
and
corresponds
to
the
american
thanksgiving
day
i
think
it
would
be
outrageous
to
butcher
the
now
that
he
has
returned
to
us
with
such
a
large
family
protested
holger
nilsson
if
times
were
easier
we
let
him
live
but
since
we
going
to
move
from
here
we
ca
keep
geese
come
along
now
and
help
me
carry
them
into
the
kitchen
urged
the
mother
they
went
out
together
and
in
a
few
moments
the
boy
saw
his
father
coming
along
with
morten
and
dunfin
one
under
each
arm
he
and
his
wife
went
into
the
cabin
the
cried
thumbietot
come
and
help
me
as
he
always
did
when
in
peril
although
he
was
not
aware
that
the
boy
was
at
hand
nils
holgersson
heard
him
yet
he
lingered
at
the
door
of
the
cow
shed
he
did
not
hesitate
because
he
knew
that
it
would
be
well
for
him
if
the
were
beheaded
at
that
moment
he
did
not
even
remember
this
but
because
he
shrank
from
being
seen
by
his
parents
they
have
a
hard
enough
time
of
it
already
he
thought
must
i
bring
them
a
new
sorrow
but
when
the
door
closed
on
the
the
boy
was
aroused
he
dashed
across
the
house
yard
sprang
up
on
the
leading
to
the
entrance
door
and
ran
into
the
hallway
where
he
kicked
off
his
wooden
shoes
in
the
old
accustomed
way
and
walked
toward
the
door
all
the
while
it
went
so
much
against
the
grain
to
appear
before
his
father
and
mother
that
he
could
not
raise
his
hand
to
knock
but
this
concerns
the
life
of
the
he
said
to
himself
he
who
has
been
my
best
friend
ever
since
i
last
stood
here
in
a
twinkling
the
boy
remembered
all
that
he
and
the
had
suffered
on
lakes
and
stormy
seas
and
among
wild
beasts
of
prey
his
heart
swelled
with
gratitude
he
conquered
himself
and
knocked
on
the
door
is
there
some
one
who
wishes
to
come
in
asked
his
father
opening
the
door
mother
you
touch
the
cried
the
boy
instantly
both
the
and
dunfin
who
lay
on
a
bench
with
their
feet
tied
gave
a
cry
of
joy
so
that
he
was
sure
they
were
alive
some
one
else
gave
a
cry
of
joy
his
my
but
you
have
grown
tall
and
handsome
she
exclaimed
the
boy
had
not
entered
the
cabin
but
was
standing
on
the
doorstep
like
one
who
is
not
quite
certain
how
he
will
be
received
the
lord
be
praised
that
i
have
you
back
again
said
his
mother
laughing
and
crying
come
in
my
boy
come
in
welcome
added
his
father
and
not
another
word
could
he
utter
but
the
boy
still
lingered
at
the
threshold
he
could
not
comprehend
why
they
were
so
glad
to
see
him
such
as
he
was
then
his
mother
came
and
put
her
arms
around
him
and
drew
him
into
the
room
and
he
knew
that
he
was
all
right
mother
and
father
he
cried
i
a
big
boy
i
am
a
human
being
again
the
parting
with
the
wild
geese
november
the
boy
arose
before
dawn
and
wandered
down
to
the
coast
he
was
standing
alone
on
the
strand
east
of
smyge
fishing
hamlet
before
sunrise
he
had
already
been
in
the
pen
with
morten
to
try
to
rouse
him
but
the
big
white
gander
had
no
desire
to
leave
home
he
did
not
say
a
word
but
only
stuck
his
bill
under
his
wing
and
went
to
sleep
again
to
all
appearances
the
weather
promised
to
be
almost
as
perfect
as
it
had
been
that
spring
day
when
the
wild
geese
came
to
skåne
there
was
hardly
a
ripple
on
the
water
the
air
was
still
and
the
boy
thought
of
the
good
passage
the
geese
would
have
he
himself
was
as
yet
in
a
kind
of
daze
sometimes
thinking
he
was
an
elf
sometimes
a
human
being
when
he
saw
a
stone
hedge
alongside
the
road
he
was
afraid
to
go
farther
until
he
had
made
sure
that
no
wild
animal
or
vulture
lurked
behind
it
very
soon
he
laughed
to
himself
and
rejoiced
because
he
was
big
and
strong
and
did
not
have
to
be
afraid
of
anything
when
he
reached
the
coast
he
stationed
himself
big
as
he
was
at
the
very
edge
of
the
strand
so
that
the
wild
geese
could
see
him
it
was
a
busy
day
for
the
birds
of
passage
bird
calls
sounded
on
the
air
continuously
the
boy
smiled
as
he
thought
that
no
one
but
himself
understood
what
the
birds
were
saying
to
one
another
presently
wild
geese
came
flying
one
big
flock
following
another
just
so
it
not
my
geese
that
are
going
away
without
bidding
me
farewell
he
thought
he
wanted
so
much
to
tell
them
how
everything
had
turned
out
and
to
show
them
that
he
was
no
longer
an
elf
but
a
human
being
there
came
a
flock
that
flew
faster
and
cackled
louder
than
the
others
and
something
told
him
that
this
must
be
flock
but
now
he
was
not
quite
so
sure
about
it
as
he
would
have
been
the
day
before
the
flock
slackened
its
flight
and
circled
up
and
down
along
the
coast
the
boy
knew
it
was
the
right
one
but
he
could
not
understand
why
the
geese
did
not
come
straight
down
to
him
they
could
not
avoid
seeing
him
where
he
stood
he
tried
to
give
a
call
that
would
bring
them
down
to
him
but
only
think
his
tongue
would
not
obey
him
he
could
not
make
the
right
sound
he
heard
akka
calls
but
did
not
understand
what
she
said
what
can
this
mean
have
the
wild
geese
changed
their
language
he
wondered
he
waved
his
cap
to
them
and
ran
along
the
shore
calling
here
am
i
where
are
you
but
this
seemed
only
to
frighten
the
geese
they
rose
and
flew
farther
out
to
sea
at
last
he
understood
they
did
not
know
that
he
was
human
had
not
recognized
him
he
could
not
call
them
to
him
because
human
beings
can
not
speak
the
language
of
birds
he
could
not
speak
their
language
nor
could
he
understand
it
although
the
boy
was
very
glad
to
be
released
from
the
enchantment
still
he
thought
it
hard
that
because
of
this
he
should
be
parted
from
his
old
comrades
he
sat
down
on
the
sands
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
what
was
the
use
of
his
gazing
after
them
any
more
presently
he
heard
the
rustle
of
wings
old
mother
akka
had
found
it
hard
to
fly
away
from
thumbietot
and
turned
back
and
now
that
the
boy
sat
quite
still
she
ventured
to
fly
nearer
to
him
suddenly
something
must
have
told
her
who
he
was
for
she
lit
close
beside
him
nils
gave
a
cry
of
joy
and
took
old
akka
in
his
arms
the
other
wild
geese
crowded
round
him
and
stroked
him
with
their
bills
they
cackled
and
chattered
and
wished
him
all
kinds
of
good
luck
and
he
too
talked
to
them
and
thanked
them
for
the
wonderful
journey
which
he
had
been
privileged
to
make
in
their
company
all
at
once
the
wild
geese
became
strangely
quiet
and
withdrew
from
him
as
if
to
say
alas
he
is
a
man
he
does
not
understand
us
we
do
not
understand
him
then
the
boy
rose
and
went
over
to
akka
he
stroked
her
and
patted
her
he
did
the
same
to
yksi
and
kaksi
kolme
and
neljä
viisi
and
kuusi
the
old
birds
who
had
been
his
companions
from
the
very
start
after
that
he
walked
farther
up
the
strand
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
the
sorrows
of
the
birds
do
not
last
long
and
he
wanted
to
part
with
them
while
they
were
still
sad
at
losing
him
as
he
crossed
the
shore
meadows
he
turned
and
watched
the
many
flocks
of
birds
that
were
flying
over
the
sea
all
were
shrieking
their
coaxing
calls
only
one
goose
flock
flew
silently
on
as
long
as
he
could
follow
it
with
his
eyes
the
wedge
was
perfect
the
speed
good
and
the
wing
strokes
strong
and
certain
the
boy
felt
such
a
yearning
for
his
departing
comrades
that
he
almost
wished
he
were
thumbietot
again
and
could
travel
over
land
and
sea
with
a
flock
of
wild
geese
