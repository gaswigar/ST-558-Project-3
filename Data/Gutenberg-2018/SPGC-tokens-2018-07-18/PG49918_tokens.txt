wickham

kate
miss
wickham

t
have
a

what
she
was
miss
miss
marsh
slept
in
miss
wickham
s
room
and
the
moment
she
fell
asleep
miss
wickham
would
have
her
up
because
her
pillow
wanted
shaking
or
she
was
thirsty
or
something
miss
pringle
i
suppose
she
was
very
inconsiderate
kate
inconsiderate
isn
t
the
word
miss
i
wouldn
t
be
a
lady
s
companion
not
for
anything
what
they
have
to
put
up
with
miss
pringle
oh
well
everyone

t
like

a
woman
of
with
a
pleasant
honest
face

she
is
gentle
with
quiet
manners
but
she
has
a
quick
temper
under
very
good
control
and
a
passionate
nature
which
is
hidden
under
a
demure
appearance
she
is
simply
dressed
in
norah
i
glad
to
see
you
i
was
hoping
you
d
be
able
to
come

this

hubbard

gone
for
a
drive
with
somebody
or
other

norah
the
norah
what
s
this
kate
it
didn
t
arrive
till
after

d
started
miss

i
wonder
whom
it
s
from
looks
at
a
card
which
is
attached
to
the
from
alfred
vincent
with
deepest
regret
for
my
dear
miss
wickham
and
heartiest
sympathy
for
her
sorrowing
kate
sorrowing
relatives

good
miss
norah
kate
i
think
you
d
better
take
it
away
kate
what
shall
i
do
with
it
miss
norah
i
m
going
to
the
cemetery
a
little
later
i
ll
take
it
with
me
kate
very
good
miss
kate
up
the
box
and
goes
miss
pringle
you
haven
t
been
crying
norah
norah
a
little
apologetic
yes
i
couldn
t
help
it
miss
pringle
what
on
earth
for
norah
my
dear
it
s
not
unnatural
miss
pringle
well
i
don
t
want
to
say
anything
against
her
now
she
s
dead
and
gone
poor
thing
but
miss
wickham
was
the
most
detestable
old
woman
i
ever
met
norah
i
don
t
suppose
one
can
live
all
that
time
with
anyone
and
not
be
a
little
sorry
to
part
with
them
for
ever
i
was
miss
wickham
s
companion
for
ten
years
miss
pringle
how
you
stood
it
exacting
domineering
disagreeable
norah
yes
i
suppose
she
was
because
she
paid
me
a
salary
she
thought
i
wasn
t
a
human
being
i
never
saw
anyone
with
such
a
bitter
tongue
at
first
i
used
to
cry
every
night
when
i
went
to
bed
because
of
the
things
she
said
to
me
but
i
got
used
to
them
miss
pringle
i
wonder
you
didn
t
leave
her
i
would
have
norah
it
s
not
easy
to
get
posts
as
lady
s
companion
miss
pringle
that
s
true
they
tell
me
the
agents
books
are
full
of
people
wanting
situations
before
i
went
to
hubbard
i
was
out
of
one
for
nearly
two
years
norah
it
s
not
so
bad
for
you
you
can
always
go
and
stay
with
your
brother
miss
pringle
you
ve
got
a
brother
too
norah
yes
but
he
s
farming
in
canada
he
had
all
he
could
do
to
keep
himself
he
couldn
t
keep
me
too
miss
pringle
how
is
he
doing
now
norah
oh
he
s
doing
very
well
he
s
got
a
farm
of
his
own
he
wrote
over
a
couple
of
years
ago
and
told
me
he
could
always
give
me
a
home
if
i
wanted
one
miss
pringle
canada
s
so
far
off
norah
not
when
you
get
there
miss
pringle
why
don
t
you
draw
the
blinds
norah
i
thought
i
ought
to
wait
till
they
come
back
from
the
funeral
miss
pringle
it
must
be
a
great
relief
to
you
now
it
s
all
over
norah
sometimes
i
can
t
realise
it
these
last
few
weeks
i
hardly
got
to
bed
at
all
and
when
the
end
came
i
was
utterly
exhausted
for
two
days
i
could
do
nothing
but
sleep
poor
miss
wickham
she
did
hate
dying
miss
pringle
that
s
the
extraordinary
part
of
it
i
believe
you
were
really
fond
of
her
norah
d
you
know
that
for
nearly
a
year
she
would
eat
nothing
but
what
i
gave
her
with
my
own
hands
and
she
liked
me
as
much
as
she
was
capable
of
liking
anybody
miss
pringle
that
wasn
t
much
norah
and
then
i
was
so
dreadfully
sorry
for
her
miss
pringle
good
heavens
norah
she
d
been
a
hard
and
selfish
woman
all
her
life
and
there
was
no
one
who
cared
for
her
it
seemed
so
dreadful
to
die
like
that
and
leave
not
a
soul
to
regret
one
her
nephew
and
his
wife
were
just
waiting
for
her
death
it
was
dreadful
each
time
they
came
down
from
london
i
saw
them
looking
at
her
to
see
if
she
was
any
worse
than
when
last
they
d
seen
her
miss
pringle
well
i
thought
her
a
horrid
old
woman
and
i
m
glad
she
s
dead
and
i
hope
she
s
left
you
well
provided
for
norah
a
oh
i
think
she
s
done
that
two
years
ago
when
i
nearly
went
away
she
said
she
d
left
me
enough
to
live
upon
miss
pringle
you
mean
when
that
assistant
of
evans
wanted
to
marry
you
i
m
glad
you
wouldn
t
have
him
norah
he
was
very
nice
but
of
course
he
wasn
t
a
gentleman
miss
pringle
i
shouldn
t
like
to
live
with
a
man
at
all
i
think
they
re
horrid
but
of
course
it
would
be
impossible
if
he
weren
t
a
gentleman
norah
a
twinkle
in
her
he
came
to
see
miss
wickham
but
she
wouldn
t
have
anything
to
do
with
him
first
she
said
that
she
couldn
t
spare
me
and
then
she
said
that
i
had
a
very
bad
temper
miss
pringle
i
like
saying
that
norah
it
s
quite
true
every
now
and
then
i
felt
i
couldn
t
put
up
with
her
any
more
i
forgot
that
i
was
dependent
on
her
and
if
she
dismissed
me
i
probably
shouldn
t
be
able
to
find
another
situation
and
i
just
flew
at
her
i
must
say
she
was
very
nice
about
it
she
used
to
look
at
me
and
grin
and
when
it
was
all
over
say
my
dear
when
you
marry
if
your
husband
s
a
wise
man
he
ll
use
a
big
stick
now
and
miss
pringle
old
cat
norah
i
should
like
to
see
a
man
try
miss
pringle
how
much
d
you
think
she
s
left
you
norah
well
of
course
i
don
t
know
the
will
is
going
to
be
read
this
afternoon
when
they
come
back
from
the
funeral
but
from
what
she
said
i
believe
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
a
year
miss
pringle
it
s
the
least
she
could
do
she
s
had
the
ten
best
years
of
your
life
norah
a
sigh
of
i
shall
never
be
at
anybody
s
beck
and
call
again
i
shall
be
able
to
get
up
when
i
like
and
go
to
bed
when
i
like
go
out
when
i
choose
and
come
in
when
i
choose
miss
pringle
you
ll
probably
marry
norah
never
miss
pringle
then
what
ll
you
do
norah
i
shall
go
to
italy
florence
rome
d
you
think
it
s
horrible
of
me
i
m
so
happy
miss
pringle
my
dear
child

a
sound
of
carriage
wheels
on
the
norah

t
i

go
up
to
your
room

oh

dear
i
m
so
happy
in
your
good
luck
norah
take
care
miss
pringle
out
into
the
garden
and
a
moment
wickham
the
wickham
a
pretty
young
woman
she
is
dressed
in
black
but
her
gown
is
elegant
and
james
wickham
a
man
with
a
baldish
head
he
is
dressed
in
black
and
wears
black
kid
dorothy
ouf
do
put
the
blinds
up
miss
marsh
we
really
needn
t
be
depressed
any
more
jim
if
you
love
me
take
those
gloves
off
they
re
perfectly
revolting
norah
to
the
window
and
draws
up
the
wickham
why
what
s
wrong
with
them
the
fellow
in
the
shop
told
me
they
were
the
right
thing
dorothy
i
never
saw
anyone
look
quite
so
funereal
as
you
do
wickham
well
you
didn
t
want
me
to
get
myself
up
as
though
i
were
going
to
a
wedding
did
you
norah
were
there
many
people
dorothy
quite
a
lot
the
sort
of
people
who
indulge
in
other
people
s
funerals
as
a
mild
form
of
dissipation
wickham
at
his
i
hope
wynne
will
look
sharp
i
don
t
want
to
miss
that
train
dorothy
who
were
all
those
stodgy
old
things
who
wrung
your
hand
afterwards
jim
wickham
i
can
t
think
they
made
me
feel
such
a
fool
dorothy
oh
was
that
it
i
saw
you
looking
a
perfect
owl
and
i
thought
you
were
giving
a
very
bad
imitation
of
restrained
emotion
wickham
dorothy
norah
would
you
like
some
tea
wickham
dorothy
well
you
might
send
some
in
so
that
it
ll
be
ready
when
wynne
comes
norah
just
going
to
ring
the
bell
wickham
her
with
a
pleasant
we
ll
ring
for
you
shall
we
i
daresay
you
ve
got
one
or
two
things
you
want
to
do
now
norah
very
good
wickham
goes
wickham
i
say
dorothy
you
oughtn
t
to
be
facetious
before
miss
marsh
she
was
extremely
attached
to
aunt
louisa
dorothy
oh
what
nonsense
it
s
always
a
very
good
rule
to
judge
people
by
oneself
and
i
m
positive
she
was
just
longing
for
the
old
lady
to
die
wickham
she
was
awfully
upset
at
the
end
dorothy
nerves
men
are
so
idiotic
they
never
understand
that
there
are
tears
tears
i
cried
myself
and
heaven
knows
i
didn
t
regret
her
death
wickham
my
dear
dorothy
you
oughtn
t
to
say
that
dorothy
why
not
it
s
perfectly
true
aunt
louisa
was
a
detestable
person
and
no
one
would
have
stood
her
for
a
minute
if
she
hadn
t
had
money
i
don
t
see
any
use
in
being
a
hypocrite
now
that
it
can
t
make
any
difference
either
way
wickham
at
his
watch
i
wish
wynne
would
hurry
up
it
ll
be
beastly
inconvenient
if
we
miss
that
train
dorothy
i
don
t
trust
miss
marsh
she
looks
as
if
she
knew
what
was
in
the
will
wickham
i
don
t
suppose
she
does
aunt
louisa
wasn
t
the
sort
of
person
to
talk
dorothy
i
m
sure
she
knows
she
s
been
left
something
wickham
oh
well
i
think
she
has
a
right
to
expect
that
aunt
louisa
led
her
a
dog
s
life
dorothy
she
had
wages
and
a
comfortable
home
if
she
didn
t
like
the
place
she
could
have
left
it
after
all
it
s
family
money
i
don
t
think
aunt
louisa
had
the
right
to
leave
it
to
strangers
wickham
we
oughtn
t
to
complain
if
miss
marsh
gets
a
small
annuity
aunt
louisa
promised
her
something
of
the
sort
when
she
had
a
chance
of
marrying
a
couple
of
years
ago
dorothy
miss
marsh
is
quite
young
it
isn
t
as
if
she
d
been
here
for
thirty
years
wickham
well
i
ve
got
an
idea
that
aunt
louisa
meant
to
leave
her
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
a
year
dorothy
but
what
s
the
estate
wickham
about
nineteen
thousand
pounds
i
believe
dorothy
oh
it
s
absurd
it
s
a
most
unfair
proportion
it
makes
all
the
difference
to
us
on
that
extra
two
hundred
and
fifty
a
year
we
could
almost
keep
a
car
wickham
my
dear
be
thankful
if
we
get
anything
at
all
dorothy
jim
stares
at
jim
you
don
t
think
oh
that
would
be
too
horrible
wickham
take
care
door
opens
kate
in
the
she
puts
them
on
a
small
how
lucky
it
is
we
had
a
fine
day
isn
t
it
dorothy
yes
wickham
it
looks
as
if
we
were
going
to
have
a
spell
of
fine
weather
dorothy
yes
wickham
it
s
funny
how
often
it
rains
for
weddings
dorothy
very
funny
kate
i
ve
been
counting
on
that
money
for
years
i
used
to
dream
at
night
that
i
was
reading
a

tallish

bald

in
his

time
at

shock

very
much

we

got
an
important
engagement
in
london
this
evening
we
re
very
anxious
not
to
miss
the
fast
train
dorothy
the
train
service
is
rotten
wynne
the
will
is
very
short
it
won
t
take
me
two
minutes
to
read
it
dorothy
and
what
on
earth
is
miss
marsh
doing
wynne
how
pretty
the
garden
is
looking
now
wickham
very
wynne
miss
wickham
was
always
so
interested
in
her
garden
dorothy
yes
wynne
my
own
tulips
aren
t
so
advanced
as
those
wickham
aren
t
they
wynne
dorothy
are
you
interested
in
gardening
dorothy
able
to
control
her
no
i
hate
it
at
last
door
is
opened
miss
marsh
wynne
wynne
how
d
you
do
miss
marsh
norah
how
d
you
do
wickham
will
you
have
a
cup
of
tea
dorothy
jim
miss
marsh
would
much
prefer
to
have
tea
quietly
after
we
re
gone
norah
a
faint
i
won
t
have
any
tea
thank
you
dorothy
wynne
has
brought
the
will
with
him
norah
oh
yes
sits
down
dorothy
clenched
hands
watches
her
she
tries
to
make
out
from
her
face
norah
wynne
miss
marsh
so
far
as
you
know
there
s
no
other
will
norah
how
d
you
mean
wynne
miss
wickham
didn
t
make
a
later
one
without
my
assistance
i
mean
you
know
of
nothing
in
the
house
for
instance
norah
oh
no
miss
wickham
always
said
you
had
her
will
she
was
extremely
methodical
wynne
i
feel
i
ought
to
ask
because
she
consulted
me
about
making
a
fresh
will
a
couple
of
years
ago
she
told
me
what
she
wanted
to
do
but
gave
me
no
actual
instructions
to
draw
it
i
thought
perhaps
she
might
have
done
it
herself
norah
i
heard
nothing
about
it
i
m
sure
that
her
only
will
is
in
your
hands
wynne
then
i
think
we
may
take
it
that
this
dorothy
understands
she
interrupts
dorothy
when
was
that
will
made
wynne
eight
or
nine
years
ago
the
exact
date
was
march
dorothy
long
searching
dorothy
when
did
you
first
come
to
miss
wickham
norah
at
the
end
of
nineteen
hundred
and
three
is
a
slight
wynne
shall
i
read
it
or
would
you
just
like
to
know
the
particulars
it
is
very
short
dorothy
let
us
just
know
roughly
wynne
well
miss
wickham
left
one
hundred
pounds
to
the
society
for
the
propagation
of
the
gospel
and
one
hundred
pounds
to
the
general
hospital
at
tunbridge
wells
and
the
entire
residue
of
her
fortune
to
her
nephew
james
wickham
dorothy
a
sharp
inspiration
of
triumph
she
looks
again
norah
norah
no
sign
of
wickham
and
miss
marsh
wynne
miss
marsh
is
not
mentioned
norah
a
faint
i
could
hardly
expect
to
be
at
the
time
the
will
was
drawn
i
had
been
miss
wickham
s
companion
for
only
a
few
months
wynne
that
is
why
i
asked
whether
you
knew
of
any
later
will
when
i
talked
to
miss
wickham
on
the
subject
she
said
her
wish
was
to
make
adequate
provision
for
you
after
her
death
i
think
she
had
spoken
to
you
about
it
norah
yes
wynne
she
mentioned
three
hundred
a
year
norah
that
was
very
kind
of
her
i
m
glad
she
wished
to
do
something
for
me
wynne
oddly
enough
she
spoke
about
it
to
evans
only
a
few
days
before
she
died
wickham
perhaps
there
a
later
will
somewhere
wynne
i
honestly
don
t
think
so
norah
i
m
sure
there
isn
t
wynne
evans
was
talking
to
miss
wickham
about
miss
marsh
she
was
tired
out
and
he
wanted
miss
wickham
to
have
a
professional
nurse
she
told
him
then
that
i
had
the
will
and
she
had
left
miss
marsh
amply
provided
for
dorothy
that
isn
t
legal
of
course
wynne
what
isn
t
dorothy
i
mean
no
one
could
force
us
i
mean
the
will
stands
as
it
is
doesn
t
it
wynne
certainly
wickham
i
m
afraid
it
s
a
great
disappointment
to
you
miss
marsh
norah
i
never
count
my
chickens
before
they
re
hatched
wynne
it
would
be
very
natural
if
miss
marsh
were
disappointed
under
the
circumstances
i
think
she
d
been
led
to
expect
dorothy
our
aunt
left
a
very
small
fortune
i
understand
and
i
suppose
she
felt
it
wouldn
t
be
fair
to
leave
a
large
part
of
it
away
from
her
own
family
wickham
of
course
it
is
family
money
she
inherited
it
from
my
grandfather
and
but
i
want
you
to
know
miss
marsh
that
my
wife
and
i
thoroughly
appreciate
all
you
did
for
my
aunt
money
couldn
t
repay
your
care
and
devotion
you
ve
been
perfectly
wonderful
norah
it
s
extremely
good
of
you
to
say
so
i
was
very
fond
of
miss
wickham
nothing
i
did
for
her
was
any
trouble
wynne
i
think
everyone
who
saw
miss
marsh
with
miss
wickham
must
be
aware
that
during
the
ten
years
she
was
with
her
she
never
spared
herself
wickham
with
a
glance
at
his
of
course
my
aunt
was
a
very
trying
woman
dorothy
earning
one
s
living
is
always
unpleasant
if
it
weren
t
there
d
be
no
incentive
to
work
norah
her
a
glance
of
quiet
amusement
at
this
surprising
wickham
my
wife
and
i
would
be
very
glad
to
make
some
kind
of
acknowledgment
of
your
services
dorothy
i
was
just
going
to
mention
it
wynne
a
i
felt
sure
that
under
the
circumstances
dorothy
him
what
were
your
wages
miss
marsh
norah
thirty
pounds
a
year
dorothy
really
many
ladies
are
glad
to
go
as
companion
without
any
salary
just
for
the
sake
of
a
home
and
congenial
society
i
daresay
you
ve
been
able
to
save
a
good
deal
in
all
these
years
norah
i
had
to
dress
myself
decently
wickham
dorothy
all
the
charm
she
can
put
into
her
well
i
m
sure
my
husband
will
be
very
glad
to
give
you
a
year
s
salary
won
t
you
jim
norah
it
s
very
kind
of
you
but
i
m
not
inclined
to
accept
anything
but
what
s
legally
due
to
me
dorothy
you
must
remember
that
there
ll
be
very
heavy
death
duties
to
pay
they
ll
swallow
up
the
income
from
miss
wickham
s
estate
for
at
least
two
years
won
t
they
wynne
norah
i
quite
understand
dorothy
perhaps
you
ll
change
your
mind
norah
i
don
t
think
so
is
a
slight
rather
awkward
wynne
up
his
manner
shows
that
he
is
not
impressed
wickham
s
wynne
well
i
think
i
must
leave
you
wickham
we
must
go
too
dorothy
dorothy
at
oh
it
ll
only
take
five
minutes
to
get
down
to
the
station
in
a
cab
wynne
miss
marsh
if
i
can
be
of
any
help
to
you
i
hope
you
ll
let
me
know
norah
that
s
very
kind
of
you
wynne
dorothy
bows
slightly
to
her
nods
wickham
dorothy
s
speech
goes
dorothy
friendly
and
jim
will
be
writing
to
you
in
a
day
or
two
you
know
how
grateful
we
both
are
for
all
you
did
for
our
poor
aunt
we
shall
be
glad
to
give
you
the
very
highest
references
wickham
to
be
able
to
offer
oh
yes
we
ll
do
everything
we
can
dorothy
you
re
such
a
wonderful
nurse
i
m
sure
you
ll
have
no
difficulty
in
getting
another
situation
i
expect
i
can
find
you
something
myself
i
ll
ask
among
all
my
friends
norah
at
her
reflectively
but
does
not
dorothy
and
smiles
at
wickham
come
on
dorothy
we
really
haven
t
got
any
time
to
lose
miss
marsh
norah
bustle
out
and
in
a
moment
the
sound
is
heard
of
wheels
on
the
drive
as
the
cab
carries
them
norah
left
alone
she
stands
staring
in
front
of
her
she
does
not
miss
pringle
in
from
the
miss
pringle
i
thought
they
were
never
going
well
norah
and
looks
at
her
without
a
miss
pringle
norah
what
s
the
matter
isn
t
it
as
much
as
you
thought
norah
miss
wickham
s
left
me
nothing
miss
pringle
oh
norah
not
a
penny
oh
it
s
cruel
after
all
there
was
no
need
for
her
to
leave
me
anything
she
gave
me
board
and
lodging
and
thirty
pounds
a
year
if
i
stayed
it
was
because
i
chose
she
needn
t
have
promised
me
anything
she
needn
t
have
prevented
me
from
marrying
miss
pringle
my
dear
you
could
never
have
married
the
little
assistant
he
wasn
t
a
gentleman
norah
ten
years
the
ten
best
years
of
a
woman
s
life
when
other
girls
are
enjoying
themselves
and
what
did
i
get
for
it
board
and
lodging
and
thirty
pounds
a
year
a
cook
does
better
than
that
miss
pringle
we
can
t
expect
to
make
so
much
money
as
a
good
cook
one
has
to
pay
something
for
living
like
a
lady
among
people
of
one
s
own
class
norah
oh
it
s
cruel
miss
pringle
to
console
my
dear
don
t
give
way
i
m
sure
you
ll
have
no
difficulty
in
finding
another
situation
you
wash
lace
beautifully
and
no
one
can
arrange
flowers
like
you
norah
i
was
dreaming
of
france
and
italy
i
shall
spend
ten
years
more
with
an
old
lady
and
then
she
ll
die
and
i
shall
look
out
for
another
situation
it
won
t
be
so
easy
then
because
i
shan
t
be
so
young
and
so
it
ll
go
on
till
i
can
t
find
a
situation
because
i
m
too
old
and
some
charitable
people
will
get
me
into
a
home
you
like
the
life
don
t
you
miss
pringle
my
dear
there
are
so
few
things
a
gentlewoman
can
do
norah
when
i
think
of
these
ten
years
having
to
put
up
with
every
unreasonableness
never
being
allowed
to
feel
ill
or
tired
no
servant
would
have
stood
what
i
have
the
humiliation
i
ve
endured
miss
pringle
you
re
tired
and
out
of
sorts
everyone
isn
t
so
trying
as
miss
wickham
i
m
sure
hubbard
has
been
kindness
itself
to
me
norah
considering
miss
pringle
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
by
considering
norah
considering
that

s
rich
and
you
re
poor

gives
you
her
old
clothes
she
often
doesn
t
ask
you
to
have
dinner
by
yourself
when
she
s
giving
a
party
she
doesn
t
remind
you
that
you
re
dependent
unless
she
s
very
much
put
out
but
you
you
ve
had
thirty
years
of
it
you
ve
eaten
the
bitter
bread
of
slavery
till
till
it
tastes
like
plum
cake

me
a

learn
not

things
than

norah
was
there
more
than
my
fair
share
gertie
you
use
double
the
number
of
stockings
than
what
i
do
and
everything
else
is
the
same
norah
a
clean
but
incompetent
gertie
there
s
many
a
true
word
spoken
in
jest
taylor
say
reg
is
it
true
that
when
you
first
come
out
you
asked
ed
where
the
was
trotter
a
that
s
right
ed
told
im
there
was
a
river
a
mile
and
a
alf
from
ere
an
that
was
the
only
e
knew
marsh
one
soon
gets
used
to
that
sort
of
thing
eh
reg
hornby
rather
if
i
saw
a
now
it
would
only
make
me
nervous
taylor
out
in
i
knew
a
couple
of
englishmen
who
were
baching
and
the
only
other
people
around
were
indians
the
first
two
years
they
was
there
they
wouldn
t
have
anything
to
do
with
the
indians
because
they
was
so
dirty
and
after
that
the
indians
wouldn
t
have
anything
to
do
with
them
puts
his
fingers
to
his
nose
to
indicate
a
nasty
norah
what
a
disgusting
story
taylor
d
you
think
so
i
rather
like
it
norah
you
would
looks
at
her
with
a
little
smile
but
does
not
gertie
are
you
going
to
sit
there
all
day
norah
marsh
why
don
t
you
keep
quiet
for
five
minutes
i
guess
norah
s
not
sorry
to
have
a
rest
after
that
gertie
the
amount
of
work
norah
did
isn
t
going
to
tire
her
much
i
reckon
norah
i
m
not
used
to
that
sort
of
work
yet
it
takes
it
out
of
me
a
bit
gertie
i
ve
not
found
out
what
sort
of
work
you
are
used
to
norah
up
and
the
two
women
start
clearing
away
the
marsh
into
one
of
the
and
marsh
give
her
time
to
get
used
to
the
life
gertie
you
can
t
expect
everything
all
at
once
gertie
it
s
always
the
same
with
english
people
you
have
to
teach
them
everything
marsh
well
you
didn
t
have
to
teach
me
to
propose
gertie
norah

things
from
taylor

gets
taylor
i
guess
i
m
in
your
way
norah
not
more
than
usual
thank
you
taylor
i
guess
you
ll
not
be
sorry
to
see
the
last
of
me
norah
i
can
t
honestly
say
that
it
makes
the
least
difference
to
me
whether
you
go
or
stay
marsh
now
don
t
start
quarrelling
you
two
hornby
when

a
bit
gertie
i
guess
you
ll
be
glad
to
get
back
to
your
own
place
taylor
i
guess
i
shan
t
be
sorry
clearing
away
is
gertie
a
large
metal
basin
and
puts
it
on
the
norah
the
kettle
and
pours
hot
water
into

the
washing

all
right

ve
noticed
the
things
aren
t
half
clean
when
i
leave
them
to
you
to
do
norah
i
m
sorry
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
gertie
i
suppose
never
did
the
washing
up
in
england
too
grand
norah
i
don
t
suppose
anyone
would
wash
up
if
they
could
help
it
it
s
not
very
amusing
gertie
you
always
want
to
be
amused
norah
no
but
i
want
to
be
happy
gertie
well
you
ve
got
a
room
over
your
head
and
a
comfortable
bed
to
sleep
in
three
good
meals
a
day
and
plenty
to
do
that
s
all
anybody
wants
to
make
them
happy
i
guess
hornby
oh
lord
gertie
sharply
on
well
if
you
don
t
like
canada
why
did
you
come
out
hornby
slowly
to
his
you
don
t
suppose
i
d
have
let
them
send
me
if
i
d
known
what
i
was
in
for
not
much
up
at
five
in
the
morning
and
working
in
the
fields
like
a
navvy
till
your
back
feels
as
if
it
ud
break
and
then
back
again
in
the
afternoon
and
the
same
thing
day
after
day
what
was
the
good
of
sending
me
to
harrow
and
oxford
if
that
s
what
i
ve
got
to
do
all
my
life
marsh
you
ll
get
used
to
it
soon
enough
reg
it
s
a
bit
hard
at
first
but
when
you
get
your
foot
in
you
wouldn
t
change
it
for
any
other
life
gertie
this
isn
t
a
country
for
a
man
to
go
to
sleep
with
and
wait
for
something
to
turn
up
trotter
i
wouldn
t
go
back
to
england
now
not
for
nothing
england
eighteen
bob
a
week
that
s
what
i
earned
and
no
prospects
out
of
work
five
months
in
the
year
norah
what
did
you
do
in
england
trotter
bricklayer
miss
gertie
you
needn
t
call
her
miss
norah
s
her
name
you
call
me
gertie
don
t
you
trotter
what
with
strikes
an
bad
times
you
never
knew
where
you
was
and
the
foreman
bullying
you
i
don
t
know
what
all
i
ad
about
enough
of
it
i
can
tell
you
i
ve
never
been
out
of
work
since
the
day
i
landed
i
ve
had
as
much
to
eat
as
i
wanted
and
i
m
saving
money
in
this
country
everybody
s
as
good
as
everybody
else
norah
if
not
better
trotter
in
two
years
i
shall
be
able
to
set
up
for
myself
why
there
s
old
man
thompson
up
at
pratt
he
started
as
a
bricklayer
come
from
yorkshire
he
did
he
s
got
seven
thousand
dollars
in
the
bank
now
marsh
you
fellows
who
come
out
now
have
a
much
softer
thing
on
than
i
did
when
i
first
came
in
those
days
they
wouldn
t
have
an
englishman
they
d
have
a
galician
rather
in
winnipeg
when
they
advertised
in
the
paper
for
labour
you
d
see
often
as
not
no
english
need
apply
gertie
well
it
was
their
own
fault
they
wouldn
t
work
or
anything
they
just
soaked
marsh
it
was
their
own
fault
right
enough
this
was
the
dumping
ground
for
all
the
idlers
drunkards
and
scallywags
in
england
they
had
the
delusion
over
there
that
if
a
man
was
too
big
a
rotter
to
do
anything
at
all
in
england
he
d
only
got
to
be
sent
out
here
and
he
d
make
a
fortune
taylor
i
guess
things
ain
t
as
bad
as
that
now
they
send
us
a
different
class
it
takes
an
englishman
two
years
longer
than
anybody
else
to
get
the
hang
of
things
but
when
once
he
tumbles
to
it
he
s
better
than
any
of
them
marsh
i
guess
nowadays
everyone
s
glad
to
see
the
englishman
make
good
when
i
nearly
smashed
up
three
years
ago
i
had
no
end
of
offers
to
help
hornby
how
did
you
smash
up
marsh
oh
i
had
a
run
of
bad
luck
one
year
my
crop
was
frosted
and
then
next
year
i
was
hailed
out
it
wants
a
good
deal
of
capital
to
stand
up
against
that
taylor
that
s
what
happened
to
me
i
was
hailed
out
and
i
hadn
t
got
capital
so
i
just
had
to
hire
out
norah
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
that
hailstorm
you
wouldn
t
have
had
the
pleasure
of
making
my
acquaintance
norah
how
hollow
and
empty
life
would
have
been
without
that
gertie
i
wonder
you
didn
t
just
quit
and
start
out
calgary
way
taylor
well
i
d
put
in
two
years
on
my
homestead
and
done
a
lot
of
clearing
it
seemed
kind
of
silly
to
lose
my
rights
now
and
when
you
ve
been
hailed
out
once
the
chances
are
it
won
t
happen
again
for
some
years
that
is
and
by
that
time
i
ought
to
have
put
a
bit
by
norah
what
sort
of
a
house
have
you
got
taylor
well
it
ain
t
what
you
might
call
a
palace
but
it
s
large
enough
for
two
marsh
thinking
of
marrying
taylor
well
i
guess
it
s
kind
of
lonesome
on
a
farm
without
a
woman
but
it
s
not
so
easy
to
find
a
wife
when
you
re
just
starting
on
your
own
canadian
girls
think
twice
before
taking
a
farmer
gertie
they
know
something
i
guess
marsh
well
you
took
one
gertie
gertie
not
because
i
wanted
to
you
can
be
sure
of
that
i
don
t
know
how
you
got
round
me
marsh
i
wonder
gertie
i
guess
it
was
because
you
was
kind
of
helpless
and
i
didn
t
know
what
you
d
do
without
me
marsh
i
guess
it
was
love
and
you
couldn
t
help
yourself
taylor
i
m
thinking
of
going
to
one
of
them
employment
agencies
when
i
get
to
winnipeg
and
looking
the
girls
over
norah
like
sheep
taylor
i
don
t
know
anythin
about
sheep
i
ve
never
had
to
do
with
sheep
norah
and
d
you
think
you
know
anything
about
women
taylor
i
guess
i
can
tell
if
they
re
strong
and
willing
and
so
long
as
they
ain
t
i
don
t
mind
taking
the
rest
on
trust
norah
and
what
inducement
is
there
for
a
girl
to
have
you
trotter
that
s
why
he
wants
to
catch
em
young
when
they
ve
just
landed
and
don
t
know
much
taylor
i
ve
got
my
quarter
section
a
hundred
and
sixty
acres
with
seventy
of
it
cleared
and
i
ve
got
a
shack
that
i
built
myself
that
s
something
ain
t
it
norah
you
ve
got
a
home
to
offer
and
enough
to
eat
and
drink
a
girl
can
get
that
anywhere
why
they
re
simply
begging
for
service
taylor
some
girls
like
getting
married
there
s
something
in
the
word
that
appeals
to
them
norah
you
seem
to
think
a
girl
would
jump
at
the
chance
of
marrying
you
taylor
she
might
do
worse
norah
i
think
you
flatter
yourself
taylor
i
know
my
job
and
there
ain
t
too
many
as
can
say
that
i
ve
got
brains
norah
what
makes
you
think
so
taylor
well
i
can
see
you
re
no
fool
gertie
a
he
put
one
over
on
you
then
norah
taylor
because
you
ve
got
no
use
for
me
there
s
no
saying
but
what
others
may
have
gertie
the
basin
out
in
order
to
pour
away
the
norah
on
drying
the
norah
of
course
there
s
no
accounting
for
tastes
taylor
i
can
try
can
t
i
norah
it
s
very
wise
of
you
to
go
to
an
agency
a
girl
s
more
likely
to
marry
you
when
she
s
only
seen
you
once
than
when
she
s
seen
you
often
taylor
a
wink
at
the
it
seems
to
make
you
quite
mad
the
thought
of
me
marrying
norah
you
wouldn
t
talk
about
it
like
that
unless
you
looked
down
upon
women
oh
i
pity
the
poor
wretched
creature
who
becomes
your
wife
taylor
i
guess
she
won
t
have
a
bad
time
when
i
ve
broken
her
in
to
my
ways
norah
are
you
under
the
impression
you
can
do
that
taylor
yep
norah
you
re
not
expecting
that
there
ll
be
much
love
lost
between
you
and
the
girl
you
honour
with
your
choice
taylor
what
s
love
got
to
do
with
it
it
s
a
business
proposition
norah
what
taylor
i
give
her
board
and
lodging
and
the
charm
of
my
society
and
in
return
she
s
got
to
cook
and
bake
and
wash
and
keep
the
shack
clean
and
tidy
and
if
she
can
do
that
i
ll
not
be
particular
what
she
looks
like
marsh
so
long
as
she
s
not
taylor

i
draw
the
line
at
that
norah
i
beg
your
pardon

didn
t
know
it
was
a
general
servant
you
wanted
you
spend
a
dollar
and
a
half
on

marriage
licence
and
then
you
don
t
have
to
pay
any
wages
it
s
a
good
investment
taylor

got
a
sharp
tongue
in
your
head
for
a
girl

pile
of
washing
in
the
marsh
i
can
t
make

what
people

think
that
if
a
man
is
too
big
a
rotter
to
do
anything
at

in
england
they

only

gone
right
we

used
to
have
scenes

came
prepared
to
like
her
and
help
her
she
met
all
my
advances
with
suspicion
marsh
she
thinks
you
look
down
upon
her
you
ought
to
remember
that
she
never
had
your
opportunities
she
s
earned
her
own
living
from
the
time
she
was
thirteen
you
can
t
expect
in
her
the
refinements
of
a
woman
who
s
led
the
protected
life
that
you
have
norah
i
haven
t
said
a
word
that
could
be
turned
into
the
least
suggestion
of
disapproval
of
anything
she
did
marsh
my
dear
your
whole
manner
has
expressed
disapproval
you
won
t
do
things
in
the
way
we
do
them
after
all
the
way
you
lived
in
tunbridge
wells
isn

the
only
way

can
live
our
ways
suit
us
and
when
you
live
amongst
us
you
must
adopt
them
norah
she
never
gave
me
a
chance
to
learn
them
she
treated
me
with
suspicion
and
enmity
from
the
very
first
day
i
came
here
when
she
sneered
at
me
because
i
talked
of
a
station
instead
of
a
depôt
of
course
i
went
on
talking
of
a
station
because
i
prefer
to
drink
water
with
my
meals
instead
of
strong
tea
she
said
i
was
putting
on
side
marsh
why
can
t
you
humour
her
you
see
you
ve
got
to
take
the
blame
for
all
the
english
people
who
came
here
in
the
past
and
were
lazy
worthless
and
supercilious
they
called
us
colonials
and
turned
up
their
noses
at
us
what
d
you
expect
us
to
do
say
thank
you
very
much
sir
we
know
we
re
not
worthy
to
black
your
boots
and
don
t
bother
to
work

be
a
pleasure
for
us
to
give
you
money
it
s
no
good
blinking
the
fact
there
was
a
great
prejudice
against
the
english
but
it
s
giving
way
now
and
every
sensible
man
and
woman
who
comes
out
can
do
something
to
destroy
it
norah
a
shrug
of
the
if
you
re
tired
of
having
me
here
i
can
go
back
to
winnipeg

as
a
great
hardship

miles
from

upon

another
through
the
whole
of
the
winter
last
year
there

a
bad
blizzard
and
for
six
weeks
we
didn

see
a
soul
outside
the
farm

another

whims

a
perfect
hell

after
time
when
she
sneered
at
me
till

blood

kept
my
temper

ten
times
more
than

going
to
knuckle
under
to
a
woman
like

marsh

she
s
my
wife

why
didn
t
you
marry
a
lady

the
use
of

a
lady

degenerated
since
you
left
england
marsh
now
look
here
my
dear
i
ll
just
tell
you
what
gertie
did
for
me
she
was
a
waitress
in
winnipeg
at
the
minnedosa
hotel
and
she
was
making
money
she
knew
what
the
life
was
on
a
farm
much
harder
than
anything
she
d
been
used
to
in
the
city
but
she
accepted
all
the
hardship
of
it
and
the
monotony
because
she
loved
me
norah
she
thought
it
a
good
match
you
were
a
gentleman
marsh
fiddledidee
she
had
the
chance
of
much
better
men
than
me
and
when
i
lost
my
harvest
two
years
running
d
you
know
what
she
did
she
went
back

my

and
don
t
talk
about
it
goes
out

unfasten
the
norah
down
on
her

rakes
out
the

from

yours
isn
t
what
you

call
light
taylor
norah
it
contains
all
i
own
in

that
since
this
morning
you
own
a
half
share
in
a
hundred
and
sixty
acres
of
as
good
land
as
there
is
in

and
a
mighty
fine

to

nothing
of
a

sharp
where
d
you

by

and
takes
two
or
three
and
some
of
the
newspapers
the

come
in
taylor
here
you
won
t
be
able
to
light
a
fire
with

like
that
where
s
that
darned
axe
glances
round
and
sees
it
by
the
logs
he
takes
a
couple
and

i
guess
you

have
plenty
to
do
getting

shack
tidy

that
s
real
good
of

taylor
norah

him
a
quick
look
and
represses
a
little
norah
yes

taylor
i
guess

some
water
takes
a
pail
and
goes
out
he
is
heard
norah
up
lifts
the
lamp
so
as
to
see
better
and
looks
round
she
is
pale
and
has
a
frightened
look
she
does
not
frank
in
and
starts
violently
when
he
speaks
to
taylor
having
a
look
at
the
shack
norah
the
lamp
how
you
startled
me
taylor
what
d
you
think
of
it
norah
i
don
t
know
taylor
i
built
it
with
my
own
hands
every
one
of
them
logs
was
a
tree
i
cut
down
myself
you
wait
till
the
morning
and
i
ll
show
you
how
they
re
joined
together
at
the
corners
there
s
some
neat
work
there
my
girl
i
guess
norah
here
s
the
kettle
pours
water
into
it
from
the
pail
and
she
puts
the
kettle
on
the
taylor
you
ll
find
some
tea
in
one
of
them
tins
on
the
shelf
leastways
there
was
some
there
when
i
come
away
i
guess
you
re
hungry
norah
i
don
t
think
i
am
very
i
ate
a
very
good
supper
in
the
train
taylor
i
m
glad
you
call
that
a
good
supper
i
guess
i
could
wrap
up
the
amount
you
ate
in
a
postal
stamp
norah
i
haven
t
a
very
large
appetite
taylor
i
have
where
s
the
loaf
we
got
in
winnipeg
this
afternoon
norah
i
ll
get
it
taylor
and
the
butter
you
ll
bake
i
reckon
norah
a
loaf
and
a
piece
of
butter
out
of
the
string
bag
she
brought
in
with
her
she
puts
them
on
the
norah
shall
i
cut
you
some
taylor
yep
norah
please
taylor
please
what
norah
a
yes
please
taylor
oh
gives
her
a
look
and
she
a
quiet
smile
on
her
face
cuts
two
or
three
pieces
of
bread
and
butter
then
she
gets
tea
out
of
the
tin
and
puts
it
in
a
taylor
i
guess
you
d
better
take
your
hat
and
coat
off
norah
so
without
taylor
you
ain
t
terribly
talkative
for
a
woman
my
girl
norah
i
haven
t
got
anything
to
say
at
the
moment
taylor
well
i
guess
it
s
better
to
have
a
wife
as
talks
too
little
than
a
wife
as
talks
too
much
norah
her
tongue
in
her
i
suppose
absolute
perfection
is
rare
in
women
poor
wretches
taylor
what
s
that
norah
i
was
only
amusing
myself
with
a
reflection
taylor
off
his
coat
and
appears
in
a
grey
sweater
he
sits
down
in
the
rocking
taylor
i
guess
there
s
no
place
like
home
you
get
a
bit
fed
up
with
hiring
out
ed
was
i
reckon
but
it
ain
t
like
being
your
own
boss
norah
what
s
through
there
taylor
oh
that
s
the
bedroom
like
to
have
a
look
norah
no
taylor
when
i
built
the
shack
i
fixed
it
up
so
as
it
would
do
when
i
got
married
sid
sharp
asked
me
what
in
hell
i
wanted
to
divide
it
up
in
half
for
but
i
guess
women
like
little
luxuries
like
that
norah
like
what
taylor
like
having
a
room
to
sleep
in
and
a
room
to
live
in
norah
here
s
the
bread
and
butter
will
you
have
some
syrup
taylor
sure
gets
up
and
sits
down
at
the
norah
that
water
ought
to
be
boiling
by
now
what
about
milk
taylor
that
s
one
of
the
things
you
ll
have
to
do
without
till
i
can
afford
to
buy
a
cow
norah
i
can
t
drink
tea
without
milk
taylor
you
try
say
can
you
milk
a
cow
norah
i
no
taylor
then
it
s
just
as
well
i
ain
t
got
one
norah
you
re
a
philosopher
lifts
the
cover
off
the
kettle
and
looks
at
it
then
pours
some
water
into
the
teapot
and
sets
it
down
on
the
norah
is
there
a
candle
i
ll
just
get
one
or
two
things
out
of
my
box
taylor
ain
t
you
going
to
sit
down
and
have
a
cup
of
tea

my
girl
norah
why
taylor
because
i
tell
you
to

i
don
t
think

then
i
ask

t
going
to
refuse

first
favour
i

pretty
of
course
not

taylor
now

tea
for

you
watches
her
do
it
is
rum
seeing
my
wife
sitting
down
at
my
table
and
pouring
out

for

it
pleasant
taylor
sure
now

some
yourself
my
girl
you
ll
soon
get
used
to
drinking
it
without
milk
and
i
guess
you
ll
be
able
to
get
some
from
sharp
norah
herself
out
some
taylor
i
had
a
sort
of
a
feeling
i
wanted
you
and
me
to
have
the
first
meal
together
in
your
new
home
just
take
a
bit
of
the
bread
and
butter
passes
over
to
her
a
slice
and
smiling
she
cuts
a
little
piece
off
and
eats
taylor
we
ain
t
lost
much
time
i
guess
why
it
s
only
yesterday
you
told
me
not
to
call
you
norah
norah
that
was
very
silly
of
me
i
was
in
a
temper
taylor
and
now
we
re
man
and
wife
norah
married
in
haste
with
a
vengeance
taylor
ain
t
you
a
bit
scared
norah
i
what
of
you
taylor
with
ed
on
t
other
side
of
winnipeg
he
might
just
as
well
be
in
the
old
country
for
all
the
good
he
can
be
to
you
you
might
be
a
bit
scared
to
find
yourself
alone
with
a
man
you
don
t
know
norah
i
m
not
nervous
taylor
good
for
you
norah
you
did
give
me
a
fright
though
when
i
asked
you
if
you
d
take
me
i
suppose
it
was
only
about
fifteen
seconds
before
you
answered
but
it
seemed
like
ten
minutes
i
thought
you
might
refuse
taylor
i
was
thinking
norah
counting
up
my
good
points
and
setting
them
against
the
bad
ones
taylor
no
i
was
thinking
you
wouldn
t
have
asked
me
like
that
if
you
hadn
t
despised
me
norah
little
taken
aback
gives
him
a
quick
look
but
she
tries
to
pass
it
off
norah
i
don
t
know
what
makes
you
think
that
taylor
well
i
don
t
know
how
you
could
have
put
it
more
plainly
that
my
name
was
mud
norah
why
didn
t
you
refuse
then
taylor
i
guess
i
m
not
a
nervous
fellow
either
norah
a
twinkle
in
her
and
women
are
scarce
in
manitoba
taylor
i
always
fancied
an
englishwoman
they
make
the
best
wives
when
they
ve
been
licked
into
shape
norah
are
you
proposing
to
attempt
that
operation
on
me
taylor
you
re
clever
i
guess
a
hint
or
two
is
about
all
you
ll
want
norah
it
embarrasses
me
when
you
pay
me
compliments
taylor
i
ll
take
you
round
and
show
you
the
land
i
ain
t
done
all
the
clearing
yet
so
there
ll
be
plenty
of
work
for
the
winter
i
want
to
have
a
hundred
acres
to
sow
next
year
and
then
if
i
get
a
good
crop
i
ve
a
mind
to
take
another
quarter
you
can
t
make
it
pay
really
without
you
ve
got
half
a
section
and
it
s
a
tough
proposition
when
you
ain
t
got
capital
norah
i
didn
t
think
i
was
marrying
a
millionaire
taylor
never
mind
my
girl
you
shan
t
live
in
a
shack
long
i
promise
you
it
s
the
greatest
country
in
the
world
we
only
want
three
good
crops
and
you
shall
have
a
brick
house
same
as
you
lived
in
at
home
norah
i
wonder
what
they
re
doing
in
england
now
taylor
well
i
guess
they
re
asleep
norah
when
i
think
of
england
i
always
think
of
it
at
looks
at
the
they
have
just
miss
wickham
had
a
beautiful
old
silver
teapot
george
and
she
was
awfully
proud
of
it
and
she
was
very
proud
of
her
it
was
old
worcester
and
she
wouldn
t
let
anyone
wash
the
things
but
and
two
or
three
times
a
week
an
old
indian
judge
came
in
to
tea
and
he
used
to
talk
to
me
about
the
east
oh
why
did
you
make
me
think
of
it
all
taylor
the
past
is
dead
and
gone
my
girl
we
ve
got
the
future
norah
no
attention
to
his
one
never
knows
when
one
s
well
off
does
one
it
s
madness
to
think
of
what
s
gone
for
ever
taylor
i
wish
we
d
got
a
drop
of
liquor
here
so
as
we
could
drink
one
another
s
health
but
as
we
ain
t
you
d
better
give
me
a
kiss
instead
norah
i
m
not
very
fond
of
kissing
taylor
a
it
ain
t
generally
an
acquired
taste
but
i
guess
you
re
peculiar
norah
it
looks
like
it
taylor
come
my
girl
you
didn
t
even
kiss
me
after
we
was
married
norah
a
perfectly
friendly
isn
t
a
hint
enough
for
you
why
do
you
force
me
to
say
everything
in
so
many
words
taylor
it
seems
to
me
it
wants
a
few
words
to
make
it
plain
when
a
woman
refuses
to
give
her
husband
a
kiss
norah
do
sit
down
there
s
a
good
fellow
and
i
ll
tell
you
one
or
two
things
taylor
that
s
terribly
kind
of
you
sinks
back
into
the
have
you
any
choice
of
seats
norah
you
ve
taken
the
only
one
that
s
tolerably
comfortable
i
think
there
s
nothing
to
choose
between
the
others
taylor
nothing
norah
i
think
we
d
better
fix
things
up
before
we
go
any
further
taylor
sure
norah
you
gave
me
to
understand
very
plainly
that
you
wanted
a
wife
in
order
to
get
a
general
servant
without
having
to
pay
her
wages
wages
are
high
in
canada
taylor
that
was
the
way
you
put
it
norah
baching
isn
t
very
comfortable
taylor
not
very
norah
you
wanted
someone
to
cook
and
bake
for
you
wash
sweep
and
mend
i
offered
to
come
and
do
all
that
it
never
struck
me
for
an
instant
that
there
was
any
possibility
of
your
expecting
anything
else
of
me
taylor
then
you
re
a
damned
fool
my
girl
norah
d
you
mind
not
saying
things
like
that
to
me
taylor
i
guess
i
shall
have
to
say
a
good
many
things
like
that
before
we
ve
done
norah
i
asked
you
to
marry
me
only
because
i
couldn
t
stay
in
the
shack
without
taylor
i
guess
you
asked
me
to
marry
you
because
you
was
in
a
hell
of
a
temper
you
wanted
to
get
away
from
ed
s
farm
right
then
and
you
didn
t
care
what
you
did
so
long
as
you
quit
but
you
was
darned
sorry
for
what
you
d
done
by
the
time
you
d
packed
your
box
norah
what
makes
you
think
that
taylor
why
when
you
come
back
in
the
kitchen
you
was
as
white
as
a
sheet
you
wanted
to
say
you
d
changed
your
mind
but
your
darned
pride
wouldn
t
let
you
norah
i
wouldn
t
have
stayed
on
in
that
house
for
anything
in
the
world
taylor
and
this
morning
when
i
called
for
you
at
the
you
wanted
to
say
you
wouldn
t
marry
me
you
tried
to
speak
the
words
but
they
wouldn
t
come
when
you
shook
hands
with
me
your
hand
was
like
ice
norah
i
was
nervous
for
a
moment
after
all
one
isn
t
married
every
day
of
one
s
life
is
one
taylor
if
i
hadn
t
shown
you
the
licence
and
the
ring
i
guess
you
wouldn
t
have
done
it
you
hadn
t
the
nerve
to
back
out
of
it
then
norah
i
hadn
t
slept
a
wink
all
night
i
kept
on
turning
it
over
in
my
mind
i
was
frightened
at
what
i
d
done
but
i
didn
t
know
a
soul
in
winnipeg
i
hadn
t
anywhere
to
go
i
had
four
dollars
in
my
pocket
i
had
to
go
through
with
it
taylor
you
took
pretty
good
stock
of
me
in
the
train
on
the
way
here
i
guess
norah
what
makes
you
think
so
taylor
well
i
felt
you
was
looking
at
me
a
good
deal
it
wasn
t
hard
to
see
that
you
was
turning
me
over
in
your
mind
what
conclusion
did
you
come
to
norah
you
see
i
lived
all
those
years
with
an
old
lady
i
know
very
little
about
men
taylor
i
guessed
that
norah
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
you
were
a
decent
fellow
i
thought
you
would
be
kind
to
me
taylor
bouquets
are
just
flying
around
have
you
got
anything
more
to
say
to
me
norah
no
taylor
then
just
get
me
my
pouch
will
you
i
guess
it
s
in
the
pocket
of
my
coat
hesitates
a
moment
looks
at
him
then
gets
norah
here
you
are
taylor
his
tongue
in
his
i
thought
you
was
going
to
tell
me
i
could
darned
well
get
it
myself
norah
i
don
t
very
much
like
being
ordered
about
taylor
you
never
paid
much
attention
to
me
till
i
reckon
norah
i
was
always
polite
to
you
taylor
very
but
i
was
the
hired
man
and
you
never
let
me
forget
it
you
thought
yourself
a
darned
sight
better
than
me
because
you
could
play
the
piano
and
speak
french
but
we
ain
t
got
a
piano
and
there
ain
t
anyone
as
speaks
french
nearer
than
winnipeg
norah
what
are
you
driving
at
taylor
parlour
tricks
ain
t
much
good
on
the
prairie
they
re
like
dollar
bills
up
in
hudson
bay
tobacco
s
the
only
thing
you
can
trade
with
an
esquimaux
you
can
t
cook
very
well
you
don
t
know
how
to
milk
a
cow
why
you
can
t
even
harness
a
horse
norah
are
you
regretting
your
bargain
already
taylor
no
i
guess
i
can
teach
you
but
if
i
was
you
i
wouldn
t
put
on
any
frills
we
shall
get
along
i
guess
when
we
ve
shaken
down
norah
you
ll
find
i
m
perfectly
capable
of
taking
care
of
myself
taylor
the
when
two
people
live
together
in
a
shack
there
s
got
to
be
a
deal
of
give
and
take
on
both
sides
as
long
as
you
do
what
i
tell
you
you
ll
be
all
right
norah
a
it
s
unfortunate
that
when
anyone
tells
me
to
do
a
thing
i
have
an
irresistible
desire
not
to
do
it
taylor
i
guess
i
tumbled
to
that
you
must
get
over
it
norah
you
ve
talked
to
me
once
or
twice
in
a
way
i
don
t
like
i
think
we
shall
get
on
better
if
you
me
to
do
things
taylor
don
t
forget
that
i
can
you
do
them
norah
how
taylor
well
i
m
stronger
than
you
are
norah
a
man
can
hardly
use
force
in
his
dealings
with
a
woman
taylor
oh
norah
you
seem
surprised
taylor
what
s
going
to
prevent
him
norah
a
little
don
t
be
so
silly
gives
her
a
look
and
then
smiles
quietly
to
taylor
well
i
m
going
to
unpack
my
grip
to
the
wash

slight
shrug
of
the
i

up
in
the
morning
taylor
wash

told
and
look
sharp
about

norah
you

puts
the

into
her
hands
but
she
flings

violently
look

if

the
biggest
hiding
you

life
norah
you

norah

taylor
what

the
good
of
that
there

t
no
one
within
a
mile
of

moment
they
are
both
silent
as
they

to
the
silence
of
the
norah
if

i

have
you
up
for
cruelty
there

she
is
terrified
by
his
norah
no
don

taylor
stops
and
looks
at

there
s
only
one
law
here
and
that
s
the
law
of
the
strongest
i
don
t
know
nothing
about
cities
perhaps
men
and
women
are
equal
there
but
on
the
prairie
a
man
s
master
because
he
s
bigger
and
stronger
than
a
woman
norah
frank
taylor
blast
you
don
t
talk
norah
struggling
between
her
pride
and
her
fear
she
will
not
look
at
her
husband
she
feels
that
he
is
getting
impatient
at
last
slowly
she
bends
down
and
picks
up
the
teapot
the
cups
and
saucers
and
puts
them
on
the
table
then
she
sinks
into
the
chair
and
bursts
into
tears
he
watches
her
with
a
slight
smile
on
his
face
but
not
norah
oh

m
so
unhappy
taylor

his
come
on
my
girl

t
shirk
the
rest
of
it
looks
up
and
sees
the
mess
of
spilt
tea
on
the
floor
she
gets
up
slowly
keeping
her
face
away
from
him
and
picks
up
the
broom
she
sweeps
up
when
she
has
finished
she
puts
the
broom
in
the
corner
he
watches
her
all
the
time
then
she
takes
up
her
hat
and
coat
and
starts
to
put
them

so
long
as

you
ain
t
under
the
impression
that

a
hotel
round
the
corner
are
you
because
there
ain
t
norah
i
ll
go
to
the
sharps

and
asleep
by
now
norah
i
can
wake
them
taylor
you
d
never
find
your
way
it
s
pitch
dark
norah
i
ll
sleep
out
of
doors
then
taylor
on
the
prairie
why
you
d
freeze
to
death
norah
what
does
it
matter
to
you
whether
i
live
or
die
taylor
it
matters
a
great
deal
women
are
scarce
in
manitoba
norah
are
you
going
to
prevent
me
from
going
taylor
sure
stands
in
front
of
the
door
and
faces
norah
you
can
t
keep
me
here
against
my
will
if
i
don
t
go
i
can
go
taylor
s
a
long
way
off
gives
a
start
and
looks
at
him
with
staring
terrified
eyes
her
throat
is
dry
with
norah
frank
what
d
you
mean
taylor
i
don
t
know
what
silly
fancies
you
had
in
your
head
when
i
married
you
i
intended
that
you
should
be
a
proper
wife
to
me
norah
but
but
can
hardly
but
you
understood
does

answer
at
last
she
collects
herself
she
tries
to
talk
calmly
and
i
m
sorry
for
the
way
i
behaved
frank
it
was
childish
of
me
to
struggle
with
you
you
irritated
me
by
the
way
you
spoke
taylor
oh
i
don
t
mind
i
don
t
know
much
about
women
and
i
guess
they
re
queer
we
had
to
fix
things
up
sometime
and
i
guess
there
was
no
harm
in
getting
it
over
right
now
norah
you
ve
beaten
me
all
along
the
line
and
i
m
in
your
power
have
mercy
on
me
taylor
i
guess
you
won
t
have
much
cause
to
complain
norah
i
married
you
in
a
fit
of
temper
it
was
very
stupid
of
me

very
sorry

that

trouble
to
you
won
t
you
let

t
do
any
of
the
things
that
you

a
wife
to
do
you

t
be
so
as
to
make
me

with
all
my
life
for
one
moment
s
madness
taylor
what
good
would
it
do
if
i
let
you

you

to
gertie
and
ask
her

you

i
don
t

got
much
pride
left
taylor
don
t
you
think
you

better
give
it
a
try
norah
all
the
life
was
so
strange
to
me
in

they
think

so
different
from
what
it
really
is
i
thought
i
should
have
a
horse
to
ride
i
expected
dances
and
tennis
parties
and
when
i
came
out
i
was
so
out
of
it
i
felt
in
the
way
and
yesterday
they
drove
me
frantic
so
that
i
felt
i
couldn
t
stay
another
moment
in
that
house
it
was
only
an
impulse
i
made
a
mistake
i
didn
t
know
what
i
was
doing
you
can
t
have
the
heart
to
take
advantage
of
it
taylor
i
knew
you
was
making
a
mistake
but
that
was
your
look
out
when
i
sell
a
man
a
horse
he
can
look
it
over
for
himself
but
i
ain
t
obliged
to
tell
him
its
faults
norah

you
mean
to
say
that
after
i
ve
begged
you
almost
on
my
knees

me
to
stay

this
trap

to
tell
you
in
so
many
words
that

physically
repellent
to
me
the
thought
of
letting
you

horrifies
and
disgusts
me
taylor

at
your
hands

gives
me
when

white
and
smooth
norah
let

taylor
his
manner
which
has
been
quite
and
speaks
more
sharply
and
with
a
certain
stern
taylor
see
here
my
girl
you
was
educated
like
a
lady
and
spent
your
life
doing
nothing
a
lady
s
companion
wasn
t
you
taking
a
little
dawg
out
for
a
walk
of
a
morning
and
combing
out
his
pretty
little
coat
and
you
look
upon
yourself
as
a
darned
sight
better
than
me
i
never
had
no
schooling
and
it
s
a
hell
of
a
job
for
me
to
write
a
letter
but
since
i
was
so
high
i
ve
earned
my
living
i
guess
i
ve
been
all
over
this
country
i
ve
been
a
trapper
and
i
ve
worked
on
the
railroad
and
for
two
years
i
ve
been
a
freighter
i
guess
i
ve
done
pretty
near
everything
but
serve
in
a
store
now
you
just
get
busy
and
forget
all
the
nonsense
you
ve
got
in
your
head
you
re
nothing
but
an
ignorant
woman
and
i
m
your
master
i
m
going
to
do
what
i
like
with
you
and
if
you
don
t
submit
willingly
by
god
i
ll
take
you
as
the
trappers
in
the
old
days
used
to
take
the
squaws
steps
towards
her
and
she
escaping
from
him
seizes
his
gun
which
is
lying
against
the
wall
she
lifts
it
and
aims
at
norah
if
you
move
i
ll
kill
you
taylor
you
daren
t
norah
unless
you
open
the
door
and
let
me
go
i
ll
shoot
you
i
ll
shoot
you
taylor
one
shoot
then
pulls
the
trigger
a
click
is
heard
but
nothing
taylor
gee
whiz
you
meant
it
norah
it
wasn
t
loaded
taylor
of
course
it
wasn
t
loaded
d
you
think
i
d
have
stood
there
and
told
you
to
shoot
if
it
had
been
i
guess
i
ain
t
thinking
of
committing
suicide
norah
and
i
almost
admired
you
taylor
you
hadn
t
got
no
reason
to
there
s
nothing
to
admire
about
a
man
who
stands
five
feet
off
a
loaded
gun
that
s
being
aimed
at
him
he
s
a
darned
fool
that
s
all
norah
the
gun
aside
you
were
laughing
at
me
now
i
ll
never
forgive
you
taylor
you
d
have
had
me
dead
as
mutton
if
that
gun
had
been
loaded
you
re
a
sport
i
never
thought
you
had
it
in
you
norah
i
ll
never
forgive
you
taylor
you
re
the
girl
for
me
i
guess
she
is
prepared
he
flings
his
arms
round
her
and
tries
to
kiss
her
she
struggles
desperately
turning
her
face
away
from
norah
let
me
alone
i
ll
kill
myself
if
you
touch
me
taylor
i
guess
you
won
t
gives
her
a
resounding
kiss
on
the
cheek
and
lets
her
go
sinking
into
a
chair
she
puts
her
hands
up
to
her
flaming
norah
oh
how
shameful
how
shameful
sobs
in
helpless
angry
despair
he
puts
his
hand
gently
on
her
taylor
hadn
t
you
better
cave
in
my
girl
you
ve
tried
your
strength
against
mine
and
it
didn
t
amount
to
much
you
tried
to
shoot
me
and
i
only
made
you
look
a
darned
fool
i
guess
you
re
beat
my
girl
there
s
only
one
law
here
and
that
s
the
law
of
the
strongest
you
ve
got
to
do
what
i
want
because
i
can
make
you
norah
haven
t
you
any
generosity
taylor
not
the
kind
you
want
i
guess
norah
oh
i
m
so
unhappy
taylor
listen
puts
up
his
finger
and
seems
to
listen
intently
she
looks
at
him
but
does
not
listen
to
the
silence
can
t
you
hear
it
the
silence
of
the
prairie
why
we
might
be
the
only
two
people
in
the
world
you
and
me
here
in
this
shack
right
out
in
the
prairie
listen
there
ain
t
a
sound
it
might
be
the
garden
of
eden
what
s
that
about
male
and
female
created
he
them
i
guess
you
re
my
wife
my
girl
and
i
want
you
gives
him
a
sidelong
look
of
terror
but
still
does
not
speak
he
takes
the
lamp
and
goes
to
the
bedroom
door
he
opens
it
and
holding
the
lamp
up
high
looks
at
her
just
to
do
something
she
takes
the
dishcloth
and
rubs
the
table
with
it
she
wants
to
gain
i
guess
it
s
getting
late
you
ll
be
able
to
have
a
good
clean
out
norah
look
of
shame
fear
anguish
passes
over
her
face
and
then
violently
a
convulsive
shudder
runs
through
her
whole
body
she
puts
her
hands
to
her
eyes
and
walks
slowly
to
the
end
of
the
third
act
act
iv
scene
same
as
in
the
previous
frank
taylor
s
at
prentice
but
there
are
signs
about
it
of
a
woman
s
presence
there
is
a
cloth
on
the
table
and
a
cushion
on
the
there
are
muslin
curtains
on
the
window
tied
back
with
ribband
and
there
are
geraniums
growing
in
tins
there
is
a
rough
bookshelf
against
the
wall
on
which
norah
s
stock
of
books
coloured
supplements
from
the
christmas
numbers
of
illustrated
papers
are
pinned
neatly
on
the
walls
the
which
had
been
used
as
stools
have
been
replaced
by
rough
chairs
taylor
made
with
his
own
hands
during
the
winter
when
the
door
of
the
shack
is
opened
the
blue
sky
is
seen
and
the
norah
arranging
mustard
flowers
in
a
pudding
basin
on
the
table
she
wears
a
serge
skirt
and
a
neat
she
has
a
healthier
look
than
before
her
face
is
tanned
and
she
has
a
higher
colour
she
hears
a
sound
and
looks
taylor
norah
i
didn
t
know
you
were
about
taylor
i
ain
t
got
much
to
do
i
ve
been
out
with
sid
sharp
and
a
man
come
over
from
prentice
norah
oh
taylor
the
say
what
have
you
got
there
norah
aren
t
they
pretty
i
picked
them
just
now
they
re
so
cheerful
taylor
very
norah
a
few
flowers
make
the
shack
look
so
much
more
bright
and
cosy
taylor
round
you
ve
made
it
a
real
home
norah
sharp
never
stops
wondering
how
you
done
it
sid
was
saying
only
the
other
day
it
was
because
you
was
a
lady
it
does
make
a
difference
i
guess
norah
a
little
i
m
glad
you
haven
t
found
me
quite
a
hopeless
failure
taylor
i
guess
i
ve
never
been
so
comfortable
in
all
my
life
it
s
what
i
always
said
when
english
girls
do
take
to
the
life
they
make
a
better
job
of
it
than
anybody
norah
what
s
the
man
come
out
from
prentice
for
taylor
a
moment
s
i
guess
you
ain
t
been
terribly
happy
here
my
girl
norah
what
on
earth
makes
you
say
that
taylor
you
ve
got
a
good
memory
i
guess
and
you
ain
t
ever
forgiven
me
for
that
first
night
norah
i
made
up
my
mind
very
soon
that
i
must
accept
the
consequences
of
what
i
d
done
i
tried
to
fall
in
with
your
ways
taylor
you
was
clever
enough
to
see
that
i
meant
to
be
master
in
my
own
house
and
i
had
the
strength
to
do
it
norah
a
faint
i
ve
cooked
for
you
and
mended
your
clothes
and
i
ve
kept
the
shack
clean
i
ve
been
obedient
and
obliging
taylor
a
little
i
guess
you
hated
me
sometimes
norah
no
one
likes
being
humiliated
as
you
humiliated
me
taylor
ed
s
coming
out
here
presently
my
girl
norah
ed
who
taylor
your
brother
norah
eddie
when
taylor
why
right
now
i
guess
he
was
in
prentice
this
morning
norah
how
d
you
know
taylor
he
phoned
over
to
sharp
s
to
say
he
was
riding
out
norah
oh
how
ripping
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
before
taylor
i
didn
t
know
norah
is
that
why
you
asked
me
if
i
was
happy
i
couldn
t
make
out
what
was
the
matter
with
you
taylor
well
i
guess
i
thought
if
you
still
wanted
to
quit
ed
s
coming
would
be
kind
of
useful
norah
why
d
you
think
i
want
to
taylor
you
ain
t
been
very
talkative
these
months
but
i
guess
it
wasn
t
hard
to
see
you
d
have
given
pretty
near
anything
in
the
world
to
quit
norah
i
m
not
going
back
to
eddie
s
farm
if
that
s
what
you
mean
taylor
if
he
comes
before
i
get
back
tell
him
i
won
t
be
long
i
guess
you
won
t
be
sorry
to
do
a
bit
of
yarning
with
him
by
yourself
norah
you
re
not
under
the
impression
i
m
going
to
say
beastly
things
about

him
taylor

guess
not
that
ain
t
your
sort
p
raps
we

t

of
one
another
yet
but
i
reckon

at
him
frank

anything
the
matter
taylor
why
no
why
norah
you
ve

to
four
acres

i

a
slight
gesture
towards
the
pudding
bowl
of
you

s
worse
at
taylor
s
but

t
make
out
who

it
isn
t
as
if
we
had
any
enemies
marsh
oh
there
s
always
someone
to
report
you
no
one
s
going
to
take
the
risk
of
letting
it
get
on
his
own
land
sharp
at
the
mustard
and
she
has
them
in
the
house
as
if

what
she
means
eddie
marsh
my

these
pretty
little
flowers
which
you
ve
picked
to
make
your
shack
look
bright
and
homelike
they
may
mean
ruin
norah
eddie
marsh
you
must
have
heard
us
talk
about
the
weed
we
farmers
have
three
enemies
to
fight
frost
hail
and
weed
sharp
we
was
hailed
out
last
year
lost
our
crop
we
never
got
a
dollar
for
it
and
if
we
lose
it
this
year
too
why
we
may
just
as
well
quit
marsh
when
it
gets
into
your
crop
you
ve
got
to
report
it
and
if
you
don
t
one
of
the
neighbours
will
and
then
they
send
an
inspector
along
and
if
he
condemns
it
why
you
just
have
to
destroy
the
crop
and
all
your
year
s
work
is
lost
you
re
lucky
if
you
ve
got
a
bit
of
money
in
the
bank
and
can
go
on
till
the
next
crop
comes
along
sharp
we

the
mouths
to
feed
that
we
have
he
can
hire
out
again
but
what
s
to
become
of
us
norah
i
wonder
why
he
never
told
me
sharp
i
guess
he
s
in
the
habit
of
keeping
his
troubles
to
himself
and
you
ve
not
taught
him
different
yet
norah
her
a
quick
look
but
seeing
the
woman
is
all
on
edge
with
nervousness
does
not
marsh
you
must
hope
for
the
best
sharp
sharp
sid
says
we
ve
only
got
it
in
one
place
but
perhaps
he
s
only
saying
it
so
i
shouldn
t
worry
you
know
what
them
inspectors
are
they
don
t
lose
nothing
by
it
it
don
t
matter
to
them
if
you
starve
all
the
winter
gives
a
sob
and
heavy
tears
roll
down
her
norah
oh
don
t
don
t
cry
sharp
after
all
it
may
be
all
right
marsh
they
won
t
condemn
the
crop
unless
it
s
very
bad
too
many
people
have
got
their
eyes
on
it
the
machine
agent
the
loan
company
sharp
what
with
the
hail
that
comes
and
hails
you
out
and
the
frost
that
kills
your
crop
just
when
you
re
beginning
to
count
on
it
and
the
weed
i
can
t
bear
it
any
more

we
lose
this
crop

sid
sell
out
and
we
ll
go
home
we
ll
take
a
little
shop
somewhere
that
s
what
i
wanted
to
do
from
the
beginning
but
sid
he
had
his
heart
set
on
farming
norah
you
couldn
t
go
back
now
you
d
never
be
happy
in
a
little
shop
and
if
you
d
stayed
in
england
you
d
have
been
always
at
the
beck
and
call
of
somebody
else
and
you
own
the
land
you
couldn
t
do
that
in
england
when
you
come
out
of
your
door
and
look
at
the
growing
wheat
aren
t
you
proud
to
think
it
s
yours
sharp
you
don
t
know
what
i
ve
had
to
put
up
with
when
the
children
came
only
once
i
had
a
doctor
the
other
times
sid
was
the
only
help
i
had
i
might
have
been
an
animal
i
wish
i
d
never
come
to
this
country
norah
how
can
you
say
that
your
children
are
strong
and
healthy
why
they
ll
be
able
to
help
you
in
the
work
soon
you
ve
given
them
a
chance
that
they
d
never
have
got
at
home
sharp
oh
it
s
all
very
well
for
them
they
ll
have
it
easy
i
know
that
but
we
ve
had
to
pay
for
it
sid
and
me
norah
you
see
you
were
the
first
it
s
bitter
work
opening
up
a
new
country
and
perhaps
it
s
others
who
reap
the
harvest
but
i
wonder
if
those
who
start
don
t
get
a
reward
that
the
later
comers
never
dream
of
marsh
she
s
right
there
sharp
i
shall
never
forget
what
i
felt
when
i
saw
my
first
crop
spring
up
and
thought
that
never
since
the
world
began
had
wheat
grown
on
that
little
bit
of
ground
i
wouldn
t
go
back
to
england
now
for
anything
in
the
world
i
couldn
t
breathe

a
man
you
have
the
best
of
it
and
all
the
credit
norah
people
don
t
know
you
mustn
t
blame
them
it
s
only
those
who
ve
lived
out
on
the
prairie
who
know
that
the
hardships
of
opening
up
a
new
country
fall
on
the
women
but
the
men
who
are
their
husbands

was
only
a
weed
you
thought
them
darned
pretty
norah
a
little
it
was
very
kind
of
you
frank
taylor
i
guess
it
s
queer
that
a
darned
little
flower
like
that
should
be
able
to
do
so
much
damage
norah
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
you
d
written
to
eddie
taylor
i
guess
i
forgot
norah
frank
eddie
brought
me
some
letters
from
home
i
ve
had
the
offer
of
a
job
in
england
frank
just
going
to
make
an
exclamation
but
immediately
controls
himself
and
answers
quite
taylor
gee
i
guess
you
ll
take
that
norah
it
s
funny
that
you
should
have
been
talking
just
now
of
my
going
away
taylor
very
norah
little
surprised
at
his
have
you
any
objection
taylor
i
guess
it
wouldn
t
make
a
powerful
lot
of
difference
to
you
if
i
had
norah
what
makes
you
think
that
taylor
i
guess
you
only
stayed
here
because
you
had
to
goes
over
to
the
little
window
and
looks
out
at
the
norah
is
life
always
like
that
the
things
you
ve
wanted
so
dreadfully
seem
only
to
bring
you
pain
when
they
come
gives
her
a
quick
look
but
does
not
answer
and
she
notices
month
after
month
i
used
to
sit
looking
at
the
prairie
and
sometimes
i
wanted
to
scream
at
the
top
of
my
voice
just
to
break
the
silence
i
thought
i
should
never
escape
the
shack
was
like
a
prison
i
was
hemmed
in
by
the
snow
and
the
cold
and
the
stillness
taylor
are
you
going
to
quit
right
now
with
ed
norah
a
you
seem
in
a
great
hurry
to
be
rid
of
me
taylor
i
guess
we
ain
t
made
a
great
success
of
married
life
my
girl
it
s
rum
when
you
come
to
figure
it
out
i
thought
i
could
make
you
do
everything
i
wanted
it
looked
as
if
i
held
a
straight
flush
and
you
beat
me
norah
i
taylor
why
yes
didn
t
you
know
that
norah
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
taylor
i
guess
i
didn
t
know
how
strong
a
woman
could
be
you
was
always
givin
way
you
done
everything
i
told
you
and
all
the
time
you
was
keepin
something
from
me
that
i
couldn
t
get
at
whenever
i
thought
to
put
my
hand
on
you
i
guess
i
found
i
d
only
caught
hold
of
a
shadow
norah
i
don
t
know
what
more
you
wanted
taylor
i
guess
i
wanted
love
norah
you
looks
at
him
with
consternation
his
words
give
her
a
queer
little
twist
of
the
taylor
i
know
you
now
less
than
when
you
d
only
been
a
week
up
at
ed
s
i
ve
lost
the
trail
and
i
m
just
floundering
around
in
the
bush
norah
a
low
i
never
knew
you
wanted
love
taylor
i
guess
i
didn
t
either
norah
i
suppose
parting
s
always
rather
painful
taylor
if
you
go
back
to
the
old
country
i
guess
i
guess
you
ll
never
come
back
norah
perhaps
you
ll
come
over
to
england
one
of
these
days
if
you
have
a
couple
of
good
years
you
could
easily
shut
the
place
up
and
run
over
for
the
winter
taylor
i
guess
that
would
be
a
dangerous
experiment
you
ll
be
a
lady
in
england
and
i
guess
i
d
be
just
the
hired
man
norah
you
d
be
my
husband
taylor
i
guess
i
wouldn
t
risk
it
norah
you
ll
write
to
me
now
and
then
and
tell
me
how
you
re
getting
on
won
t
you
taylor
will
you
want
to
know
norah
why
yes
taylor
i
ll
write
and
tell
you
if
i
m
making
good
if
i
ain
t
i
guess
i
shan
t
feel
much
like
writing
norah
but
you
ll
make
good
frank
i
know
you
well
enough
for
that
taylor
do
you
norah
i
have
learnt
to
respect
you
during
these
months
we
ve
lived
together
all
sorts
of
qualities
which
i
used
to
value
seem
very
unimportant
to
me
now
you
ve
taught
me
a
great
deal
taylor
you
ll
think
of
me
sometimes
my
girl
won
t
you
norah
i
don
t
suppose
i
shall
be
able
to
prevent
it
taylor
i
was
an
ignorant
uneducated
man
i
didn
t
know
how
to
treat
you
properly
i
wanted
to
make
you
happy
and
i
didn
t
seem
to
know
just
how
to
do
it
norah
you
ve
never
been
unkind
to
me
frank
you
ve
been
very
patient
with
me
taylor
i
guess
you
ll
be
happier
away
from
me
i
ll
be
able
to
think
that
you
re
warm
and
comfortable
at
home
and
you
ve
got
plenty
to
eat
norah
d
you
think
that
s
all
i
want
gives
her
a
rapid
glance
and
then
setting
his
teeth
looks
taylor
i
couldn
t
expect
you
to
stay
on
here
not
when
you
got
a
chance
of
going
back
to
the
old
country
this
life
is
all
new
to
you
and
you
know
that
one
norah
oh
yes
i
know
it
i
should
think
i
did
she
pictures
to
herself
the
daily
round
which
awaits
her
she
is
filled
with
a
sort
of
mirthless
scorn
and
this
presently
as
she
speaks
is
mixed
with
hatred
and
at
eight
o
clock
every
morning
a
maid
will
bring
me
tea
and
hot
water
and
i
shall
get
up
and
i
shall
have
breakfast
and
i
shall
interview
the
cook
i
shall
order
luncheon
and
dinner
and
i
shall
brush
the
coats
of
hubbard
s
poms
and
take
them
for
a
walk
on
the
common
all
the
paths
on
the
common
are
asphalted
so
that
elderly
gentlemen
and
lady
s
companions
shouldn
t
get
their
feet
wet
taylor
gee
norah
and
then
i
shall
come
in
and
lunch
and
after
luncheon
i
shall
go
for
a
drive
one
day
in
this
direction
and
one
day
in
that
and
then
i
shall
have
tea
and
then
i
shall
go
out
again
on
the
nice
neat
asphalt
paths
to
give
the
dogs
another
walk
and
then
i
shall
change
my
dress
and
come
down
to
dinner
and
after
dinner
i
shall
play
bezique
with
my
employer
and
i
must
take
care
not
to
beat
her
because
she
doesn
t
like
being
beaten
and
at
ten
o
clock
i
shall
go
to
bed
pauses
a
at
eight
o
clock
next
morning
a
maid
will
bring
in
my
tea
and
hot
water
and
the
day
will
begin
again
every
day
will
be
just
like
every
other
and
there
are
hundreds
of
women
in
england
strong
and
capable
with
blood
in
their
veins
who
would
be
eager
to
get
the
place
that
s
offered
to
me
almost
a
lady
and
pounds
a
year
taylor
been
gazing
at
her
steadily
what
she
means
begins
to
dawn
on
him
but
he
restrains
himself
he
will
not
look
at
her
taylor
i
guess
it
s
a
bit
different
from
the
life
you
ve
had
here
norah
to
and
you
will
be
clearing
the
scrub
cutting
down
trees
ploughing
the
land
sowing
and
reaping
you
will
be
fighting
every
day
frost
hail
and
weed
you
will
be
fighting
but
i
know
you
ll
be
conquering
in
the
end
where
was
wilderness
will
be
cultivated
land
and
who
knows
what
starving
child
may
eat
the
bread
that
has
been
made
from
the
wheat
that
you
grew
my
life
will
be
ineffectual
and
useless
but
you
will
have
done
something
worth
while
taylor
why
what
s
the
matter
with
you
norah
norah
does
not
say
the
words
to
her
but
rather
to
himself
as
though
they
were
forced
from
him
in
agony
of
norah
when
i
was
talking
to
sharp
just
now
i
don
t
know
what
i
said
i
was
just
trying
to
comfort
her
because
she
was
crying
and
it
seemed
to
be
someone
else
who
was
speaking
and
i
listened
to
myself
i
thought
i
hated
the
prairie
through
the
long
winter
months
and
yet
somehow
it
has
caught
hold
of
me
it
was
dreary
and
monotonous
and
yet
i
can
t
get
it
out
of
my
heart
there
s
a
beauty
and
a
romance
in
it
which
fill
my
soul
with
longing
taylor
i
guess
we
all
hate
the
prairie
sometimes
but
when
you
ve
once
lived
in
it
it
ain
t
easy
to
live
anywhere
else
norah
i
know
the
life
now
it
s
not
adventurous
and
exciting
for
men
and
women
it
s
the
same
hard
work
from
morning
till
night
and
i
know
it
s
the
women
who
bear
the
greater
burden
the
men
go
into
the
towns
they
have
shooting
now
and
then
and
the
different
seasons
bring
them
different
work
but
for
the
women
it
s
always
the
same
cooking
mending
washing
sweeping
and
yet
it
s
all
got
a
meaning
we
too
have
our
part
in
opening
up
the
country
we
are
its
mothers
and
the
future
is
in
us
we
are
building
up
the
greatness
of
the
nation
it
needs
our
courage
and
strength
and
hope
and
because
it
needs
them
they
come
to
us
oh
frank
i
can
t
go
back
to
that
petty
narrow
life
what
have
you
done
to
me
taylor
i
guess
if
i
asked
you
to
stay
now
you
d
stay
norah
a
low
you
said
you
wanted
my
love
don
t
you
know
love
has
been
growing
in
me
slowly
month
by
month
and
i
wouldn
t
see
it
i
told
myself
i
hated
you
i
was
ashamed
it
s
only
when
i
had
the
means
of
leaving
you
for
ever
that
i
knew
i
couldn
t
live
without
you
i
m
not
ashamed
any
more
i
love
you
taylor
i
guess
i
loved
you
from
the
beginning
norah
norah
why
d
you
say
it
as
if
what
s
the
matter
frank
taylor
i
guess
you
ll
have
to
take
that
job
in
england
i
can
t
ask
you
to
stay
on
norah
why
taylor
the
inspector
s
condemned
the
crop
i
m
bust
norah
oh
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
taylor
i
guess
i
couldn
t
i
made
up
my
mind
when
i
married
you
that
i
d
make
good
i
couldn
t
expect
you
to
see
that
it
was
just
bad
luck
anyone
can
get
the
weed
in
his
crop
but
i
guess
a
man
oughtn
t
to
have
bad
luck
the
odds
are
that
it
s
his
own
fault
if
he
has
norah
now
i
understand
about
eddie
taylor
i
wrote
to
him

thought

taylor
why
