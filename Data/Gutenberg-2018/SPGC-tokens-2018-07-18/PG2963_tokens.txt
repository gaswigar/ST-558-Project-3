i
pass
a
day
with
her
we
talk
of
marrying
each
other
the
countess
piccolomini
was
a
fine
example
of
the
adventurers
she
was
young
tall
had
eyes
full
of
fire
and
skin
of
a
dazzling
whiteness
not
however
that
natural
whiteness
which
delights
those
who
know
the
value
of
a
satin
skin
and
rose
petals
but
rather
that
artificial
fairness
which
is
commonly
to
be
seen
at
rome
on
the
faces
of
courtezans
and
which
disgusts
those
who
know
how
it
is
produced
she
had
also
splendid
teeth
glorious
hair
as
black
as
jet
and
arched
eyebrows
like
ebony
to
these
advantages
she
added
attractive
manners
and
there
was
something
intelligent
about
the
way
she
spoke
but
through
all
i
saw
the
adventuress
peeping
out
which
made
me
detest
her
as
she
did
not
speak
anything
but
italian
the
countess
had
to
play
the
part
of
a
mute
at
table
except
where
an
english
officer
named
walpole
was
concerned
who
finding
her
to
his
taste
set
himself
to
amuse
her
i
felt
friendly
disposed
towards
this
englishman
though
my
feelings
were
certainly
not
the
result
of
sympathy
if
i
had
been
blind
or
deaf
sir
james
walpole
would
have
been
totally
indifferent
to
me
as
what
i
felt
for
him
was
the
result
of
my
observation
although
i
did
not
care
for
the
countess
for
all
that
i
went
up
to
her
room
after
dinner
with
the
greater
part
of
the
guests
the
count
arranged
a
game
of
whist
and
walpole
played
at
primero
with
the
countess
who
cheated
him
in
a
masterly
manner
but
though
he
saw
it
he
laughed
and
paid
because
it
suited
his
purpose
to
do
so
when
he
had
lost
fifty
louis
he
called
quarter
and
the
countess
asked
him
to
take
her
to
the
theatre
this
was
what
the
englishman
wanted
and
he
and
the
countess
went
off
leaving
the
husband
playing
whist
i
too
went
to
the
play
and
as
chance
would
have
it
my
neighbour
in
the
pit
was
count
tot
brother
to
the
count
famous
for
his
stay
in
constantinople
we
had
some
conversation
together
and
he
told
me
he
had
been
obliged
to
leave
france
on
account
of
a
duel
which
he
had
had
with
a
man
who
had
jested
with
him
for
not
being
present
at
the
battle
of
minden
saying
that
he
had
absented
himself
in
view
of
the
battle
the
count
had
proved
his
courage
with
the
sword
on
the
other
body
a
rough
kind
of
argument
which
was
fashionable
then
as
now
he
told
me
he
had
no
money
and
i
immediately
put
my
purse
at
his
service
but
as
the
saying
goes
a
kindness
is
never
thrown
away
and
five
years
later
he
did
the
same
by
me
at
petersburg
between
the
acts
he
happened
to
notice
the
countess
piccolomini
and
asked
me
if
i
knew
her
husband
i
know
him
very
slightly
i
answered
but
we
happen
to
be
staying
at
the
same
hotel
he
a
regular
black
sheep
said
the
count
and
his
wife
no
better
than
he
it
seemed
that
they
had
already
won
a
reputation
in
the
town
after
the
play
i
went
back
to
the
hotel
by
myself
and
the
told
me
that
piccolomini
had
set
out
with
his
servant
his
only
luggage
being
a
light
portmanteau
he
did
not
know
the
reason
of
this
sudden
departure
but
a
minute
afterwards
the
countess
came
in
and
her
maid
having
whispered
something
to
her
she
told
me
that
the
count
had
gone
away
because
he
had
fought
a
duel
but
that
often
happened
she
asked
me
to
sup
with
her
and
walpole
and
her
appetite
did
not
seem
to
suffer
from
the
absence
of
her
spouse
just
as
we
were
finishing
supper
an
englishman
who
had
been
of
the
whist
party
came
up
and
told
walpole
that
the
italian
had
been
caught
cheating
and
had
given
the
lie
to
their
fellow
englishman
who
had
detected
him
and
that
they
had
gone
out
together
an
hour
afterwards
the
englishman
returned
with
two
wounds
one
on
the
and
one
on
the
shoulder
it
was
a
trifling
affair
altogether
next
day
after
i
had
had
dinner
with
the
comte
i
found
a
letter
from
piccolomini
with
an
enclosure
addressed
to
the
countess
waiting
for
me
at
the
inn
he
begged
me
to
give
his
wife
the
letter
which
would
inform
her
of
his
plans
and
then
to
bring
her
to
the
ville
de
lyon
at
amsterdam
where
he
was
staying
he
wanted
to
know
how
the
englishman
whom
he
had
wounded
was
getting
on
the
duty
struck
me
as
an
amusing
one
and
i
should
have
laughed
with
all
my
heart
if
i
had
felt
the
least
desire
to
profit
by
the
confidence
he
was
pleased
to
place
in
me
nevertheless
i
went
up
to
the
countess
whom
i
found
sitting
up
in
bed
playing
with
walpole
she
read
the
letter
told
me
that
she
could
not
start
till
the
day
following
and
informed
me
what
time
she
would
go
as
if
it
had
been
all
settled
but
i
smiled
sardonically
and
told
her
that
my
business
kept
me
at
the
hague
and
that
i
could
not
possibly
escort
her
when
walpole
heard
me
say
this
he
offered
to
be
my
substitute
to
which
she
agreed
they
set
out
the
day
following
intending
to
lie
at
leyden
two
days
after
their
departure
i
was
sitting
down
to
dinner
with
the
usual
company
increased
by
two
frenchmen
who
had
just
come
after
the
soup
one
of
them
said
coolly
the
famous
casanova
is
now
in
holland
is
he
said
the
other
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
him
and
ask
for
an
explanation
which
he
will
not
like
i
looked
at
the
man
and
feeling
certain
that
i
had
never
seen
him
before
i
began
to
get
enraged
but
i
merely
asked
the
fellow
if
he
knew
casanova
i
ought
to
know
him
said
he
in
that
tone
which
is
always
so
unpleasant
nay
sir
you
are
mistaken
i
am
casanova
without
losing
his
he
replied
insolently
you
are
really
very
much
mistaken
if
you
think
you
are
the
only
casanova
in
the
world
it
was
a
sharp
answer
and
put
me
in
the
wrong
i
bit
my
lips
and
held
my
tongue
but
i
was
grievously
offended
and
determined
to
make
him
find
the
casanova
who
was
in
holland
and
from
whom
he
was
going
to
extract
an
unpleasant
explanation
in
myself
in
the
meanwhile
i
bore
as
well
as
i
could
the
poor
figure
he
must
be
cutting
before
the
officers
at
table
who
after
hearing
the
insolence
of
this
young
blockhead
might
take
me
for
a
coward
he
the
insolent
fellow
had
no
scruple
in
abusing
the
triumph
his
answer
had
given
him
and
talked
away
in
the
random
fashion
at
last
he
forgot
himself
so
far
as
to
ask
from
what
country
i
came
i
am
a
venetian
sir
i
replied
ah
then
you
are
a
good
friend
to
france
as
your
republic
is
under
french
protection
at
these
words
my
boiled
aver
and
in
the
tone
of
voice
one
uses
to
put
down
a
puppy
i
replied
that
the
republic
of
venice
was
strong
enough
to
do
without
the
protection
of
france
or
of
any
other
power
and
that
during
the
thirteen
centuries
of
its
existence
it
had
had
many
friends
and
allies
but
no
protectors
perhaps
i
ended
you
will
reply
by
begging
my
pardon
for
not
knowing
that
these
was
only
one
venice
in
the
world
i
had
no
sooner
said
this
than
a
burst
of
laughter
from
the
whole
table
set
me
right
again
the
young
blockhead
seemed
taken
aback
and
in
his
turn
bit
his
lips
but
his
evil
genius
made
him
strike
in
again
at
dessert
as
usual
the
conversation
went
from
one
subject
to
another
and
we
began
to
talk
about
the
duke
of
albermarle
the
englishmen
spoke
in
his
favour
and
said
that
if
he
had
been
alive
there
would
have
been
no
war
between
england
and
france
they
were
probably
right
but
even
if
the
duke
had
lived
war
might
have
broken
out
as
the
two
nations
in
question
have
never
yet
succeeded
in
understanding
that
it
is
for
both
their
interests
to
live
at
peace
together
another
englishman
praised
lolotte
his
mistress
i
said
i
had
seen
that
charming
woman
at
the
duchess
of
fulvi
and
that
no
one
deserved
better
to
become
the
countess
of
eronville
the
count
of
eronville
a
and
a
man
of
letters
had
just
married
her
i
had
scarcely
finished
what
i
had
to
say
when
master
blockhead
said
with
a
laugh
that
he
knew
lolotte
to
be
a
good
sort
of
girl
as
he
had
slept
with
her
at
paris
i
could
restrain
myself
no
longer
my
indignation
and
rage
consumed
me
i
took
up
my
plate
and
made
as
if
i
would
throw
it
at
his
head
saying
at
the
same
time
you
infernal
liar
he
got
up
and
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
but
i
could
see
by
his
that
he
was
a
soldier
everybody
pretended
not
to
hear
anything
of
this
and
the
conversation
went
on
for
some
time
on
indifferent
subjects
and
at
last
they
all
rose
from
their
seats
and
left
the
room
my
enemy
said
to
his
companion
that
they
would
see
one
another
again
after
the
play
and
remained
by
the
fire
with
his
elbow
resting
on
the
i
remained
at
table
till
the
company
had
all
left
the
room
and
when
we
were
alone
together
i
got
up
and
looked
him
straight
in
the
face
and
went
out
walking
towards
sheveningue
sure
that
he
would
follow
me
if
he
were
a
man
of
any
mettle
when
i
had
got
to
some
distance
from
the
hotel
i
looked
round
and
saw
that
he
was
following
me
at
a
distance
of
fifty
paces
when
i
got
to
the
wood
i
stopped
at
a
suitable
place
and
stood
awaiting
my
antagonist
he
was
ten
paces
off
when
he
drew
his
sword
and
i
had
plenty
of
time
to
draw
mine
though
he
came
on
fast
the
fight
did
not
last
long
for
as
soon
as
he
was
near
enough
i
gave
him
a
thrust
which
has
never
failed
me
and
sent
him
back
quicker
than
he
came
he
was
wounded
in
the
chest
above
the
right
breast
but
as
my
sword
was
flat
and
the
opening
large
enough
the
wound
bled
easily
i
lowered
my
sword
and
ran
up
to
him
but
i
could
do
nothing
he
said
that
we
should
meet
again
at
amsterdam
if
i
was
going
there
and
that
he
would
have
his
revenge
i
saw
him
again
five
or
six
years
afterwards
at
warsaw
and
then
i
did
him
a
kindness
i
heard
afterwards
that
his
name
was
varnier
but
i
do
not
know
whether
he
was
identical
with
the
president
of
the
national
convention
under
the
infamous
robespierre
i
did
not
return
to
the
hotel
till
after
the
play
and
i
then
heard
that
the
frenchman
after
having
the
surgeon
with
him
for
an
hour
had
set
out
for
rotterdam
with
his
friend
we
had
a
pleasant
supper
and
talked
cheerfully
together
without
a
word
being
said
about
the
duel
with
the
exception
that
an
english
lady
said
i
forget
in
what
connection
that
a
man
of
honour
should
never
risk
sitting
down
to
dinner
at
an
hotel
unless
he
felt
inclined
if
necessary
to
fight
the
remark
was
very
true
at
that
time
when
one
had
to
draw
the
sword
for
an
idle
word
and
to
expose
one
self
to
the
consequences
of
a
duel
or
else
be
pointed
at
even
by
the
ladies
with
the
finger
of
scorn
i
had
nothing
more
to
keep
me
at
the
hague
and
i
set
out
next
morning
before
for
amsterdam
on
the
way
i
stopped
for
dinner
and
recognized
sir
james
walpole
who
told
me
that
he
had
started
from
amsterdam
the
evening
before
an
hour
after
giving
the
countess
into
her
husband
charge
he
said
that
he
had
got
very
tired
of
her
as
he
had
nothing
more
to
get
from
a
woman
who
gave
more
than
one
asked
if
were
opened
wide
enough
i
got
to
amsterdam
about
midnight
and
took
up
my
abode
at
the
old
bible
the
neighbourhood
of
esther
had
awakened
my
love
for
that
charming
girl
and
i
was
so
impatient
to
see
her
that
i
could
not
sleep
i
went
out
about
ten
and
called
on
who
welcomed
me
in
the
friendliest
manner
and
reproached
me
for
not
having
alighted
at
his
house
when
he
heard
that
i
had
given
up
business
he
congratulated
me
on
not
having
removed
it
into
holland
as
i
should
have
been
ruined
i
did
not
tell
him
that
i
had
nearly
come
to
that
in
france
as
i
considered
such
a
piece
of
information
would
not
assist
my
designs
he
complained
bitterly
of
the
bad
faith
of
the
french
government
which
had
involved
him
in
considerable
losses
and
then
he
asked
me
to
come
and
see
esther
i
was
too
impatient
to
embrace
her
to
stay
to
be
asked
twice
i
ran
to
greet
her
as
soon
as
she
saw
me
she
gave
a
cry
of
surprise
and
delight
and
threw
herself
in
my
arms
where
i
received
her
with
fondness
equal
to
her
own
i
found
her
grown
and
improved
she
looked
lovely
we
had
scarcely
sat
down
when
she
told
me
that
she
had
become
as
skilled
in
the
cabala
as
myself
it
makes
my
life
happy
said
she
for
it
gives
me
a
power
over
my
father
and
assures
me
that
he
will
never
marry
me
to
anyone
but
the
man
of
my
choice
i
am
delighted
that
you
extract
the
only
good
that
can
proceed
from
this
idle
science
namely
the
power
to
guide
persons
devoid
of
strength
of
will
but
your
father
must
think
that
i
taught
you
the
secret
yes
he
does
and
he
said
one
day
that
he
would
forgive
me
any
sacrifices
i
might
have
made
to
obtain
this
precious
secret
from
you
he
goes
a
little
further
than
we
did
my
dearest
esther
yes
and
i
told
him
that
i
had
gained
it
from
you
without
any
sacrifice
and
that
now
i
was
a
true
pythoness
without
having
to
endure
the
torments
of
the
tripod
and
i
am
sure
that
the
replies
you
gave
were
invented
by
yourself
but
if
that
were
so
how
could
i
have
known
where
the
was
or
whether
the
ship
was
safe
you
saw
the
portfolio
yourself
and
threw
it
where
it
was
discovered
and
as
for
the
vessel
you
spoke
at
random
but
as
you
are
an
honest
man
confess
that
you
were
afraid
of
the
results
i
am
never
so
bold
as
that
and
when
my
father
asks
me
questions
of
that
kind
my
replies
are
more
obscure
than
a
sibyl
i
do
wish
him
to
lose
confidence
in
my
oracle
nor
do
i
wish
him
to
be
able
to
reproach
me
with
a
loss
that
would
injure
my
own
interests
if
your
mistake
makes
you
happy
i
shall
leave
you
in
it
you
are
really
a
woman
of
extraordinary
talents
you
are
quite
unique
i
do
want
your
compliments
said
she
in
a
rather
vexed
manner
i
want
a
sincere
avowal
of
the
truth
i
do
think
i
can
go
as
far
as
that
at
these
words
which
i
pronounced
in
a
serious
way
esther
went
into
a
reverie
but
i
was
not
going
to
lose
the
superiority
i
had
over
her
and
racked
my
brains
to
find
some
convincing
prediction
the
oracle
might
make
to
her
and
while
i
was
doing
so
dinner
was
announced
there
were
four
of
us
at
table
and
i
concluded
that
the
fourth
of
the
party
must
be
in
love
with
esther
as
he
kept
his
eyes
on
her
the
whole
time
he
was
her
father
favourite
clerk
and
no
doubt
her
father
would
have
been
glad
if
she
had
fallen
in
love
with
him
but
i
soon
saw
that
she
was
not
likely
to
do
so
esther
was
silent
all
through
dinner
and
we
did
not
mention
the
cabala
till
the
clerk
was
gone
is
it
possible
said
for
my
daughter
to
obtain
the
answers
of
the
oracle
without
your
having
taught
her
i
always
thought
such
a
thing
impossible
till
i
answered
but
esther
has
convinced
me
that
i
was
mistaken
i
can
teach
the
secret
to
no
one
without
losing
it
myself
for
the
oath
i
swore
to
the
sage
who
taught
me
forbids
me
to
impart
it
to
another
under
pain
of
forfeiture
but
as
your
daughter
has
taken
no
such
oath
having
acquired
it
herself
she
may
be
for
all
i
know
at
perfect
liberty
to
communicate
the
secret
to
anyone
esther
who
was
as
keen
as
a
razor
took
care
to
say
that
the
same
oath
that
i
had
taken
had
been
imposed
on
her
by
the
oracle
and
that
she
could
not
communicate
the
cabalistic
secret
to
anyone
without
the
permission
of
her
genius
under
pain
of
losing
it
herself
i
read
her
inmost
thoughts
and
was
rejoiced
to
see
that
her
mind
was
calmed
she
had
reason
to
be
grateful
to
me
whether
i
had
lied
or
not
for
i
had
given
her
a
power
over
her
father
which
a
father
kindness
could
not
have
assured
but
she
perceived
that
what
i
had
said
about
her
oracular
abilities
had
been
dictated
merely
by
politeness
and
she
waited
till
we
were
alone
to
make
me
confess
as
much
her
worthy
father
who
believed
entirely
in
the
infallibility
of
our
oracles
had
the
curiosity
to
put
the
same
question
to
both
of
us
to
see
if
we
should
agree
in
the
answer
esther
was
delighted
with
the
idea
as
she
suspected
that
the
one
answer
would
flatly
contradict
the
other
and
having
written
his
question
on
two
sheets
of
paper
gave
them
to
us
esther
went
up
to
her
own
room
for
the
operation
and
i
questioned
the
oracle
on
the
table
at
which
we
had
had
dinner
in
the
presence
of
the
father
esther
was
quick
as
she
came
down
before
i
had
extracted
from
the
pyramid
the
letters
which
were
to
compose
my
reply
but
as
i
knew
what
to
say
as
soon
as
i
saw
her
father
read
the
answer
she
gave
him
i
was
not
long
in
finishing
what
i
had
to
do
asked
if
he
should
try
to
get
rid
of
the
french
securities
he
held
in
spite
of
the
loss
he
would
incur
by
selling
out
esther
oracle
replied
you
must
sow
plentifully
before
you
reap
pluck
not
up
the
vine
before
the
season
of
the
vintage
for
your
vine
is
planted
in
a
fruitful
soil
mine
ran
as
follows
if
you
sell
out
you
will
repent
for
there
will
be
a
new
who
will
pay
all
claims
before
another
year
has
elapsed
esther
answer
was
conceived
in
the
sibylline
style
and
i
admired
the
readiness
of
her
wit
but
mine
went
right
to
the
point
and
the
worthy
man
embraced
us
joyfully
and
taking
his
hat
and
stick
said
that
since
our
replies
agreed
he
would
run
the
risk
of
losing
three
million
francs
and
make
a
profit
of
five
or
six
hundred
thousand
in
the
course
of
the
year
his
daughter
began
to
recant
and
would
have
warned
him
against
the
danger
but
he
who
was
as
firm
as
a
mussulman
kissed
her
again
saying
the
oracle
is
not
wont
to
lie
and
even
if
it
does
deceive
me
this
time
it
will
only
be
a
fourth
part
of
my
fortune
that
i
shall
lose
when
esther
and
i
were
alone
i
began
to
compliment
her
much
to
her
delight
on
the
cleverness
of
her
answer
the
elegance
of
her
style
and
her
boldness
for
she
could
not
be
as
well
acquainted
with
french
affairs
as
i
was
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
said
she
for
having
confirmed
my
reply
but
confess
that
you
lied
to
please
me
i
confess
since
that
will
please
you
and
i
will
even
tell
you
that
you
have
nothing
more
to
learn
you
are
a
cruel
man
but
how
could
you
reply
that
there
would
be
another
in
a
year
time
and
run
the
risk
of
compromising
the
oracle
i
never
dare
to
say
things
like
that
i
love
the
oracle
too
well
to
expose
it
to
shame
and
confusion
that
shews
that
i
do
not
invent
the
answers
but
since
the
oracle
has
pronounced
it
i
am
willing
to
bet
that
silhouette
will
be
dismissed
your
obstinacy
drives
me
to
despair
for
i
shall
not
rest
till
i
know
that
i
am
as
much
a
master
of
the
cabala
as
you
are
and
yet
you
will
not
confess
that
you
invent
the
answers
yourself
for
charity
sake
do
something
to
convince
me
of
the
contrary
i
will
think
it
over
i
passed
the
whole
day
with
this
delightful
girl
whose
amiable
disposition
and
great
wealth
would
have
made
me
a
happy
man
if
it
were
not
for
my
the
love
of
independence
and
my
aversion
to
make
up
my
mind
to
live
for
the
rest
of
my
days
in
holland
in
the
course
of
my
life
i
have
often
observed
that
the
happiest
hours
are
often
the
heralds
of
misfortune
the
very
next
day
my
evil
genius
took
me
to
the
ville
de
lyon
this
was
the
inn
where
piccolomini
and
his
wife
were
staying
and
i
found
them
there
in
the
midst
of
a
horde
of
cheats
and
sharpers
like
themselves
as
soon
as
the
good
people
heard
my
name
they
rushed
forward
some
to
greet
me
and
others
to
have
a
closer
look
at
me
as
if
i
were
some
strange
wild
beast
amongst
those
present
were
a
chevalier
de
sabi
who
wore
the
uniform
of
a
polish
major
and
protested
he
had
known
me
at
dresden
a
baron
de
wiedan
claiming
bohemia
as
his
fatherland
who
greeted
me
by
saying
that
his
friend
the
comte
germain
had
arrived
at
the
etoile
and
had
been
enquiring
after
me
an
bravo
who
was
introduced
to
me
as
the
chevalier
de
la
perine
whom
i
recognized
at
the
first
glance
as
the
fellow
called
talvis
who
had
robbed
the
of
presburg
who
had
lent
me
a
hundred
louis
the
same
day
and
with
whom
i
had
fought
a
duel
at
paris
finally
there
was
an
italian
named
neri
who
looked
like
a
blacksmith
minus
his
honesty
and
said
that
he
remembered
seeing
me
one
evening
at
the
casino
i
recollected
having
seen
him
at
the
place
where
i
met
the
wretched
lucie
in
the
midst
of
this
band
of
i
saw
the
wife
of
the
pretended
chevalier
de
sabi
a
pretty
woman
from
saxony
who
speaking
italian
indifferently
well
was
paying
her
addresses
to
the
countess
piccolomini
i
bit
my
lips
with
anger
to
find
myself
in
such
honourable
company
but
putting
a
good
face
on
a
bad
game
i
greeted
everybody
politely
and
then
drawing
a
roll
of
a
hundred
louis
from
my
pocket
i
presented
them
to
master
perine
talvis
telling
him
i
was
glad
to
be
able
to
return
them
to
him
with
my
best
thanks
my
politeness
did
not
meet
with
much
of
a
reception
for
the
impudent
scoundrel
answered
me
as
he
pocketed
the
money
that
he
remembered
having
lent
it
me
at
presburg
but
he
also
remembered
a
more
important
matter
and
pray
what
is
that
said
i
in
a
dry
and
tone
you
owe
me
a
revenge
at
the
sword
point
as
you
know
right
well
here
is
the
mark
of
the
gash
you
gave
me
seven
years
ago
so
saying
the
wretched
little
man
opened
his
shirt
and
shewed
the
small
round
scar
this
scene
which
belonged
more
to
farce
than
comedy
seemed
to
have
struck
all
tongues
with
paralysis
anywhere
else
than
in
holland
where
important
and
delicate
business
debars
me
from
fighting
i
shall
be
glad
to
meet
you
and
mark
you
again
if
you
still
desire
to
cross
swords
with
me
but
while
i
am
here
i
must
beg
you
not
to
disturb
me
all
the
same
you
may
as
well
know
that
i
never
go
out
without
a
couple
of
friends
in
my
pockets
and
that
if
you
attack
me
i
shall
blow
your
brains
out
in
my
revenge
must
be
with
crossed
swords
said
he
however
i
will
let
you
finish
your
business
you
will
do
wisely
piccolomini
who
had
been
casting
a
hungry
eye
upon
my
hundred
louis
proposed
immediately
afterwards
a
bank
at
faro
and
began
to
deal
prudence
would
have
restrained
me
from
playing
in
such
company
but
the
dictates
of
prudence
were
overcome
by
my
desire
to
get
back
the
hundred
louis
which
i
had
given
talvis
so
i
cut
in
i
had
a
run
of
bad
luck
and
lost
a
hundred
ducats
but
as
usual
my
loss
only
excited
me
i
wished
to
regain
what
i
had
lost
so
i
stayed
to
supper
and
afterwards
with
better
luck
won
back
my
money
i
was
content
to
stop
at
this
and
to
let
the
money
i
had
paid
to
talvis
go
so
i
asked
piccolomini
to
pay
me
which
he
did
with
a
bill
of
exchange
on
an
amsterdam
bank
drawn
by
a
firm
in
middlesburg
at
first
i
made
some
difficulty
in
taking
it
on
the
pretext
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
negotiate
but
he
promised
to
let
me
have
the
money
next
day
and
i
had
to
give
in
i
made
haste
to
leave
this
place
after
refusing
to
lend
talvis
a
hundred
louis
which
he
wanted
to
borrow
of
me
on
the
strength
of
the
revenge
i
owed
him
he
was
in
a
bad
humour
both
on
this
account
and
because
he
had
lost
the
hundred
louis
i
had
paid
him
and
he
allowed
himself
to
use
abusive
language
which
i
treated
with
contempt
i
went
to
bed
promising
myself
never
to
set
foot
in
such
a
place
again
the
next
morning
however
i
went
out
with
the
intention
of
calling
on
piccolomini
to
get
the
bill
of
exchange
cashed
but
on
my
way
i
happened
to
go
into
a
and
to
meet
rigerboos
therese
friend
whose
acquaintance
the
reader
has
already
made
after
greeting
each
other
and
talking
about
therese
who
was
now
in
london
and
doing
well
i
skewed
him
my
bill
telling
him
the
circumstances
under
which
i
had
it
he
looked
at
it
closely
and
said
it
a
forgery
and
the
original
from
which
it
was
copied
was
honoured
yesterday
he
saw
that
i
could
scarcely
believe
it
and
told
me
to
come
with
him
to
be
convinced
of
the
truth
of
what
he
said
he
took
me
to
a
merchant
of
his
acquaintance
who
skewed
me
the
genuine
bill
which
he
had
cashed
the
day
before
for
an
individual
who
was
unknown
to
him
in
my
indignation
i
begged
rigerboos
to
come
with
me
to
piccolomini
telling
him
that
he
might
cash
it
without
remark
and
that
otherwise
he
would
witness
what
happened
we
arrived
at
the
count
and
were
politely
received
the
count
asking
me
to
give
him
the
bill
and
he
would
send
it
to
the
bank
to
be
cashed
but
rigerboos
broke
in
by
saying
that
it
would
be
dishonoured
as
it
was
a
mere
copy
of
a
bill
which
had
been
cashed
the
evening
before
piccolomini
pretended
to
be
greatly
astonished
and
said
that
though
he
could
not
believe
it
he
would
look
into
the
matter
you
may
look
into
it
when
you
please
said
i
but
in
the
mean
time
i
should
be
obliged
by
your
giving
me
five
hundred
florins
you
know
me
sir
said
he
raising
his
voice
i
guarantee
to
pay
you
and
that
ought
to
be
enough
no
doubt
it
would
be
enough
if
i
chose
but
i
want
my
money
at
this
his
wife
came
in
and
began
to
take
her
part
in
the
dispute
and
on
the
arrival
of
the
count
man
a
very
rigerboos
took
hold
of
me
by
the
arm
and
drew
me
forcibly
away
follow
me
said
he
when
we
were
outside
and
let
me
see
to
this
business
myself
he
took
me
to
a
man
who
turned
out
to
be
the
lieutenant
of
police
and
after
he
had
heard
the
case
he
told
me
to
give
him
the
bill
of
exchange
and
to
say
where
i
was
going
to
dine
i
told
him
i
should
be
at
and
saying
that
would
do
he
went
off
i
thanked
rigerboos
and
went
to
esther
who
reproached
me
tenderly
for
not
having
been
to
see
her
the
evening
before
that
flattered
me
and
i
thought
her
a
really
charming
girl
i
must
take
care
said
i
not
to
see
you
every
day
for
your
eyes
have
a
sway
over
me
that
i
shall
not
be
able
to
resist
much
longer
i
shall
believe
as
much
of
that
as
i
choose
but
have
you
thought
of
any
way
of
convincing
me
what
do
you
want
to
be
convinced
about
if
it
be
true
that
there
is
in
your
cabala
an
intelligence
distinct
from
your
own
you
ought
to
be
able
to
find
some
way
of
proving
it
to
me
that
is
a
happy
thought
i
will
think
it
over
at
that
moment
her
father
came
in
from
the
exchange
and
we
sat
dawn
to
dinner
we
were
at
dessert
when
a
police
official
brought
me
five
hundred
florins
for
which
i
gave
him
a
receipt
when
he
had
gone
i
told
my
entertainers
what
had
happened
the
evening
before
and
in
the
morning
and
the
fair
esther
reproached
me
for
preferring
such
bad
company
to
her
by
way
of
punishment
said
she
i
hope
you
will
come
with
me
to
the
theatre
this
evening
though
they
are
going
to
give
a
dutch
play
of
which
you
will
not
understand
a
word
i
shall
be
near
you
and
that
is
enough
for
me
in
fact
i
did
not
comprehend
a
word
of
the
actors
gibberish
and
was
terribly
bored
as
esther
preserved
a
solemn
and
serious
silence
the
whole
time
as
we
were
coming
from
the
theatre
she
told
me
all
about
the
piece
with
charming
grace
and
wonderful
memory
she
seemed
to
wish
to
give
me
some
pleasure
in
return
for
the
tedium
to
which
she
had
condemned
me
when
we
got
home
we
had
supper
and
that
evening
heaven
be
thanked
i
heard
nothing
more
about
the
cabala
before
we
parted
esther
and
her
father
made
me
promise
to
dine
with
them
every
day
and
to
let
them
know
if
anything
prevented
my
coming
next
morning
about
eight
while
i
was
still
dressing
i
suddenly
saw
piccolomini
standing
before
me
and
as
he
had
not
sent
in
his
name
i
began
to
feel
suspicious
i
rang
the
bell
for
my
faithful
spaniard
who
came
in
directly
i
want
to
speak
to
you
privately
said
he
tell
that
fellow
to
go
out
he
can
stay
i
answered
he
does
not
know
a
word
of
italian
le
duc
of
course
knew
italian
perfectly
well
yesterday
about
noon
he
began
two
men
came
into
my
room
they
were
accompanied
by
the
innkeeper
who
served
as
interpreter
one
of
the
men
asked
me
if
i
felt
inclined
to
cash
there
and
then
a
forged
bill
of
exchange
which
i
had
given
the
night
before
and
which
he
held
in
his
hands
as
i
gave
no
reply
he
told
me
that
there
was
no
time
for
consideration
or
argument
i
must
say
yes
or
no
there
and
then
for
such
were
their
instructions
from
the
chief
of
police
i
had
no
choice
in
the
matter
so
i
paid
the
five
hundred
florins
but
i
did
not
get
back
the
bill
and
the
man
told
me
i
could
not
have
it
unless
i
told
the
police
the
name
of
the
person
from
whom
i
got
it
as
in
the
interests
of
commerce
the
forger
must
be
prosecuted
my
reply
was
that
i
could
not
possibly
tell
them
what
they
wanted
as
i
had
got
it
of
a
stranger
who
had
come
into
my
room
while
i
was
holding
a
small
bank
of
faro
to
pass
the
time
i
told
him
that
after
this
person
who
i
had
thought
introduced
by
someone
in
the
company
had
gone
i
found
to
my
surprise
that
nobody
knew
him
and
i
added
that
if
i
had
been
aware
of
this
i
would
not
only
have
refused
the
bill
but
would
not
have
allowed
him
to
play
thereupon
the
second
policeman
said
that
i
had
better
find
out
who
this
person
was
or
else
i
should
be
considered
as
the
forger
and
prosecuted
accordingly
after
this
threat
they
went
out
in
the
afternoon
my
wife
called
on
the
chief
of
police
and
was
politely
received
but
after
hearing
what
she
had
to
say
he
informed
her
that
she
must
find
out
the
forger
since
casanova
honour
might
be
endangered
by
the
banker
taking
proceedings
against
him
in
which
case
he
would
have
to
prosecute
me
you
see
in
what
a
difficult
position
we
are
placed
and
i
think
you
ought
to
try
to
help
us
you
have
got
your
money
and
you
are
not
without
friends
get
their
influence
exerted
in
the
matter
and
we
shall
hear
no
more
about
it
your
interests
as
well
as
mine
are
concerned
except
as
a
witness
of
the
fact
i
answered
i
can
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
affair
you
agree
that
i
received
the
bill
from
you
since
you
cashed
it
that
is
enough
for
me
i
should
be
glad
to
be
of
service
to
you
but
i
really
do
see
what
i
can
do
the
best
advice
i
can
give
you
is
to
make
a
sacrifice
of
the
rascally
sharper
who
gave
you
the
forged
bill
and
if
you
ca
do
that
i
would
counsel
you
to
disappear
and
the
sooner
the
better
or
else
you
may
come
to
the
galleys
or
worse
he
got
into
a
rage
at
this
and
turning
his
back
on
me
went
out
saying
i
should
be
sorry
for
what
i
had
said
my
spaniard
followed
him
down
the
stair
and
came
back
to
tell
me
that
the
signor
had
gone
off
threatening
vengeance
and
that
in
his
opinion
i
would
do
well
to
be
on
my
guard
all
right
said
i
say
no
more
about
it
all
the
same
i
was
really
very
grateful
for
his
advice
and
i
gave
the
matter
a
good
deal
of
thought
i
dressed
myself
and
went
to
see
esther
whom
i
had
to
convince
of
the
divinity
of
my
oracle
a
different
task
with
one
whose
own
wits
had
told
her
so
much
concerning
my
methods
this
was
the
problem
she
gave
me
to
solve
your
oracle
must
tell
me
something
which
i
and
only
i
know
feeling
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
fulfil
these
conditions
i
told
her
that
the
oracle
might
reveal
some
secret
she
might
not
care
to
have
disclosed
that
is
impossible
she
answered
as
the
secret
will
be
known
only
to
myself
but
if
the
oracle
replies
i
shall
know
the
answer
as
well
as
you
and
it
may
be
something
you
would
not
like
me
to
know
there
is
no
such
thing
and
even
if
there
were
if
the
oracle
is
not
your
own
brain
you
can
always
find
out
anything
you
want
to
know
but
there
is
some
limit
to
the
powers
of
the
oracle
you
are
making
idle
excuses
either
prove
that
i
am
mistaken
in
my
ideas
or
acknowledge
that
my
oracle
is
as
good
as
yours
this
was
pushing
me
hard
and
i
was
on
the
point
of
declaring
myself
conquered
when
a
bright
idea
struck
me
in
the
midst
of
the
dimple
which
added
such
a
charm
to
her
chin
esther
had
a
little
dark
mole
garnished
with
three
or
four
extremely
fine
hairs
these
moles
which
we
call
in
italian
nei
and
which
are
usually
an
improvement
to
the
prettiest
face
when
they
occur
on
the
face
the
neck
the
arms
or
the
hands
are
duplicated
on
the
corresponding
parts
of
the
body
i
concluded
therefore
that
esther
had
a
mole
like
that
on
her
chin
in
a
certain
place
which
a
virtuous
girl
does
not
shew
and
innocent
as
she
was
i
suspected
that
she
herself
did
not
know
of
this
second
mole
existence
i
shall
astonish
her
i
said
to
myself
and
establish
my
superiority
in
a
manner
which
will
put
the
idea
of
having
equal
skill
to
mine
out
of
her
head
for
good
then
with
the
solemn
and
look
of
a
seer
i
made
my
pyramid
and
extracted
these
words
from
it
fair
and
discreet
esther
no
one
knows
that
at
the
entrance
of
the
temple
of
love
you
have
a
mole
precisely
like
that
which
appears
on
your
chin
while
i
was
working
at
my
calculations
esther
was
leaning
over
me
and
following
every
movement
as
she
really
knew
as
much
about
the
cabala
as
i
did
she
did
not
want
it
to
be
explained
to
her
but
translated
the
numbers
into
letters
as
i
wrote
them
down
as
soon
as
i
had
extracted
all
the
combinations
of
numbers
from
the
pyramid
she
said
quietly
that
as
i
did
not
want
to
know
the
answer
she
would
be
much
obliged
if
i
would
let
her
translate
the
cypher
with
pleasure
i
replied
and
i
shall
do
so
all
the
more
willingly
as
i
shall
thereby
save
your
delicacy
from
sharing
with
me
a
secret
which
may
or
may
not
be
agreeable
i
promise
you
not
to
try
to
find
it
out
it
is
enough
for
me
to
see
you
convinced
i
shall
be
convinced
when
i
have
verified
the
truth
of
the
reply
are
you
persuaded
dearest
esther
that
i
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
framing
this
answer
i
shall
be
quite
sure
of
it
if
it
has
spoken
the
truth
and
if
so
the
oracle
will
have
conquered
for
the
matter
is
so
secret
a
one
that
even
i
do
not
know
of
it
you
need
not
know
yourself
as
it
is
only
a
trifle
which
would
not
interest
you
but
it
will
be
enough
to
convince
me
that
the
answers
of
your
oracle
are
dictated
by
an
intelligence
which
has
nothing
in
common
with
yours
there
was
so
much
candour
and
frankness
in
what
she
said
that
a
feeling
of
shame
replaced
the
desire
of
deceiving
her
and
i
shed
some
tears
which
esther
could
only
interpret
favourably
to
me
nevertheless
they
were
tears
of
remorse
and
now
as
i
write
after
such
a
lapse
of
years
i
still
regret
having
deceived
one
so
worthy
of
my
esteem
and
love
even
then
i
reproached
myself
but
a
pitiable
feeling
of
shame
would
not
let
me
tell
the
truth
but
i
hated
myself
for
thus
leading
astray
one
whose
esteem
i
desired
to
gain
in
the
mean
time
i
was
not
absolutely
sure
that
i
had
hit
the
mark
for
in
nature
like
everything
else
every
law
has
its
exceptions
and
i
might
possibly
have
dug
a
pitfall
for
myself
on
the
other
hand
if
i
were
right
esther
would
no
doubt
be
convinced
for
the
moment
but
her
belief
would
speedily
disappear
if
she
chanced
to
discover
that
the
correspondence
of
moles
on
the
human
body
was
a
necessary
law
of
nature
in
that
case
i
could
only
anticipate
her
scorn
but
however
i
might
tremble
i
had
carried
the
deception
too
far
and
could
not
draw
back
i
left
esther
to
call
on
rigerboos
whom
i
thanked
for
his
offices
on
my
behalf
with
the
chief
of
the
police
he
told
me
that
i
had
nothing
to
fear
from
piccolomini
in
holland
but
all
the
same
he
advised
me
not
to
go
about
without
pistols
i
am
on
the
eve
of
embarking
for
batavia
said
he
in
a
vessel
which
i
have
laden
with
the
ruins
of
my
fortune
in
the
state
my
affairs
are
in
i
thought
this
the
best
plan
i
have
not
insured
the
cargo
so
as
not
diminish
my
profits
which
will
be
considerable
if
i
succeed
if
the
ship
is
taken
or
wrecked
i
shall
take
care
not
to
survive
its
loss
and
after
all
i
shall
not
lose
much
poor
riberboos
said
all
this
as
if
he
were
jesting
but
despair
had
no
doubt
a
good
deal
to
do
with
his
resolve
since
it
is
only
in
great
misery
that
we
despise
both
life
and
fortune
the
charming
therese
trenti
whom
rigerboos
always
spoke
of
as
our
lady
had
contributed
to
his
ruin
in
no
small
degree
she
was
then
in
london
where
by
her
own
account
she
was
doing
well
she
had
exchanged
the
name
of
trenti
for
that
of
cornelis
or
cornely
which
as
i
found
out
afterwards
was
rigerboo
real
name
we
spent
an
hour
in
writing
to
this
curious
woman
as
we
desired
to
take
advantage
of
the
circumstance
that
a
man
whom
rigerboos
desired
to
commend
to
her
was
shortly
going
to
england
when
we
had
finished
we
went
sleighing
on
the
amstel
which
had
been
frozen
over
for
several
days
this
diversion
of
which
the
dutch
are
very
fond
is
to
my
thinking
the
dullest
imaginable
for
an
objectless
journey
is
no
pleasure
to
me
after
we
were
well
frozen
we
went
to
eat
oysters
with
sillery
to
warm
ourselves
again
and
after
that
we
went
from
one
casino
to
another
not
intending
to
commit
any
debauchery
but
for
want
of
something
better
to
do
but
it
seemed
decreed
that
whenever
i
preferred
any
amusement
of
this
kind
to
the
charms
of
esther
society
i
should
come
to
grief
i
do
not
know
how
it
happened
but
as
we
were
going
into
one
of
these
casinos
rigerboos
called
me
loudly
by
my
name
and
at
that
instant
a
woman
such
as
one
usually
finds
in
these
places
came
forward
and
began
to
gaze
at
me
although
the
room
was
ill
enough
lighted
i
saw
it
was
the
wretched
lucie
whom
i
had
met
a
year
before
without
her
recognizing
me
i
turned
away
pretending
not
to
know
her
for
the
sight
of
her
was
disagreeable
to
me
but
in
a
sad
voice
she
called
me
by
my
name
congratulating
me
on
my
prosperity
and
bewailing
her
own
wretchedness
i
saw
that
i
could
neither
avoid
her
nor
repulse
her
without
inhumanity
so
i
called
to
rigerboos
to
come
upstairs
and
the
girl
would
divert
us
by
recounting
the
history
of
her
life
strictly
speaking
lucie
had
not
become
ugly
one
could
still
see
that
she
had
been
a
beautiful
woman
but
for
all
that
her
appearance
inspired
me
with
terror
and
disgust
since
the
days
when
i
had
known
her
at
pasean
nineteen
years
of
misery
profligacy
and
shame
had
made
her
the
most
debased
the
vilest
creature
that
can
be
imagined
she
told
us
her
story
at
great
length
the
pith
of
it
might
be
expressed
in
six
lines
the
footman
who
had
seduced
her
had
taken
her
to
trieste
to
lie
in
and
the
scoundrel
lived
on
the
sale
of
her
charms
for
five
or
six
months
and
then
a
sea
captain
who
had
taken
a
fancy
to
her
took
her
to
zante
with
the
footman
who
passed
for
her
husband
at
zante
the
footman
turned
soldier
and
deserted
the
army
four
years
after
she
was
left
alone
and
continued
living
on
the
wages
of
prostitution
for
six
years
but
the
goods
she
had
to
offer
lowering
in
value
and
her
customers
being
of
the
inferior
kind
she
set
out
for
england
with
a
young
greek
girl
whom
an
english
officer
of
marines
treated
as
his
wife
and
whom
he
abandoned
in
the
streets
of
london
when
he
got
tired
of
her
after
living
for
two
or
three
years
in
the
vilest
haunts
in
london
lucie
came
to
holland
where
not
being
able
to
sell
her
own
person
any
longer
she
became
a
procuress
a
natural
ending
to
her
career
lucie
was
only
but
she
was
the
wreck
of
a
woman
and
women
are
always
as
old
as
they
look
while
she
told
her
history
she
emptied
two
bottles
of
burgundy
i
had
ordered
and
which
neither
i
nor
my
friend
touched
finally
she
told
us
she
was
now
supported
by
two
pretty
girls
whom
she
kept
and
who
had
to
give
her
the
half
of
what
they
got
rigerboos
asked
her
jokingly
if
the
girls
were
at
the
casino
no
said
she
they
are
not
here
and
shall
never
come
here
for
they
are
ladies
of
high
birth
and
their
uncle
who
looks
after
their
interests
is
a
venetian
gentleman
at
this
i
could
not
keep
back
my
laughter
but
lucie
without
losing
countenance
told
me
that
she
could
only
repeat
the
account
they
had
given
of
themselves
that
if
we
wanted
to
be
convinced
we
had
only
to
go
and
see
them
at
a
house
she
rented
fifty
paces
off
and
that
we
need
not
be
afraid
of
being
disturbed
if
we
went
as
their
uncle
lived
in
a
different
part
of
the
town
oh
indeed
said
i
he
does
not
live
with
his
highborn
nieces
then
no
he
only
comes
to
dinner
to
hear
how
business
has
been
going
and
to
take
all
the
money
from
them
come
along
said
rigerboos
we
will
go
and
see
them
as
i
was
desirous
of
seeing
and
addressing
the
noble
venetian
ladies
of
so
honourable
a
profession
i
told
lucie
to
take
us
to
the
house
i
knew
very
well
that
the
girls
were
impostors
and
their
a
blackguard
but
the
die
was
cast
we
found
them
to
be
young
and
pretty
lucie
introduced
me
as
a
venetian
and
they
were
beside
themselves
with
joy
to
have
someone
to
whom
they
could
talk
i
found
out
directly
that
they
came
from
padua
not
venice
as
they
spoke
the
paduan
dialect
which
i
knew
very
well
i
told
them
so
and
they
confessed
it
was
the
truth
i
asked
the
name
of
their
uncle
but
they
said
they
could
not
tell
me
we
can
get
on
without
knowing
said
rigerboos
catching
hold
of
the
one
he
liked
best
lucie
brought
in
some
ham
oysters
a
pie
and
a
good
many
bottles
of
wine
and
then
left
us
i
was
not
in
the
humour
for
wantonness
but
rigerboos
was
disposed
to
be
merry
his
sweetheart
was
at
first
inclined
to
be
prudish
on
his
taking
liberties
with
her
but
as
i
began
to
follow
his
example
the
ladies
relaxed
their
severity
we
went
first
to
one
and
then
the
other
and
before
long
they
were
both
in
the
state
of
eve
before
she
used
the
after
passing
an
hour
in
these
lascivious
combats
we
gave
each
of
the
girls
four
ducats
paid
for
the
provisions
we
had
consumed
and
sent
six
louis
to
lucie
we
then
left
them
i
going
to
bed
cross
with
myself
for
having
engaged
in
such
brutal
pleasures
next
morning
i
awoke
late
and
in
a
bad
humour
partly
from
the
debauch
of
the
night
before
for
profligacy
depresses
as
well
as
degrades
the
mind
and
partly
from
the
thought
that
i
had
neglected
esther
who
had
unquestionably
been
grieved
by
my
absence
i
felt
that
i
must
hasten
to
reassure
her
feeling
certain
that
i
should
find
some
excuses
to
make
and
that
they
would
be
well
received
i
rang
for
le
duc
put
on
my
and
sent
him
for
my
coffee
he
had
scarcely
left
the
room
when
the
door
opened
and
i
saw
perine
and
the
fellow
named
wiedan
whom
i
had
seen
at
piccolomini
and
who
styled
himself
a
friend
of
germain
i
was
sitting
on
my
bed
putting
on
my
stockings
my
apartments
consisted
of
three
fine
rooms
but
they
were
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
all
the
noise
i
could
have
made
would
not
have
been
heard
the
bell
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
le
duc
would
be
gone
fully
ten
minutes
and
i
was
in
imminent
danger
of
being
assassinated
without
the
possibility
of
the
above
thoughts
flashed
through
my
head
with
lightning
speed
and
all
that
i
could
do
was
to
keep
calm
and
say
well
gentlemen
what
can
i
do
for
you
wiedan
took
upon
himself
to
answer
me
count
piccolomini
has
found
himself
forced
to
declare
that
he
received
the
forged
bill
from
us
in
order
that
he
may
escape
from
the
difficult
position
in
which
your
denunciation
placed
him
he
has
warned
us
that
he
is
going
to
do
so
and
we
must
escape
forthwith
if
we
want
to
avoid
prosecution
we
have
not
a
penny
we
are
desperate
men
well
gentlemen
what
have
i
to
do
with
that
give
us
four
hundred
florins
immediately
we
do
not
want
more
but
we
must
have
that
much
and
now
if
you
refuse
we
will
take
to
flight
with
everything
of
yours
that
we
can
lay
our
hands
on
and
our
arguments
are
these
with
this
each
man
drew
a
pistol
from
his
pocket
and
aimed
it
at
my
head
you
need
not
have
recourse
to
violence
said
i
it
can
only
be
fatal
to
you
stay
here
are
a
hundred
ducats
more
than
you
asked
begone
and
i
wish
you
a
pleasant
journey
but
i
would
not
be
here
when
my
servant
comes
back
if
i
were
you
wiedan
took
the
roll
of
money
with
a
trembling
hand
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
without
examining
it
but
perine
came
up
and
praising
my
noble
generosity
would
have
put
his
arms
around
my
neck
and
kissed
me
i
repulsed
him
but
without
rudeness
and
they
went
their
ways
leaving
me
very
glad
to
have
rid
myself
of
them
at
so
cheap
a
rate
as
soon
as
i
was
out
of
this
snare
i
rang
my
bell
not
to
have
them
followed
but
that
i
might
get
dressed
as
quickly
as
possible
i
did
not
say
a
word
to
le
duc
about
what
had
happened
i
was
silent
even
to
my
landlord
and
after
i
had
sent
my
spaniard
to
to
excuse
my
dining
there
that
day
i
went
to
the
chief
of
police
but
had
to
wait
two
hours
before
i
could
see
him
as
soon
as
the
worthy
man
had
heard
my
account
of
my
misfortune
he
said
he
would
do
his
best
to
catch
the
two
rascals
but
he
did
not
conceal
from
me
his
fears
that
it
was
already
too
late
i
took
the
opportunity
of
telling
him
of
piccolomini
visit
to
me
his
claims
and
threats
he
thanked
me
for
doing
so
and
promised
to
see
to
it
but
he
advised
me
for
the
future
to
be
on
my
guard
and
ready
to
defend
myself
in
case
i
was
attacked
before
he
could
place
my
enemies
in
a
place
where
they
could
do
me
no
harm
i
hastened
home
again
as
i
felt
an
acid
taste
in
my
mouth
skewed
me
how
all
these
shocks
had
upset
me
but
i
knew
what
to
do
i
took
a
strong
glass
of
lemonade
which
made
me
bring
up
a
good
deal
of
bile
and
i
then
felt
much
better
towards
evening
i
went
to
see
esther
and
found
her
looking
serious
and
rather
vexed
but
as
soon
as
she
saw
how
pale
i
was
her
face
lighted
up
and
she
asked
me
in
a
voice
of
tenderest
interest
if
i
had
been
ill
i
told
her
i
had
been
out
of
sorts
that
i
had
taken
some
medicine
and
that
i
now
felt
better
you
will
see
my
appetite
at
supper
added
i
to
calm
her
fears
i
have
had
nothing
to
eat
since
dinner
yesterday
this
was
really
the
truth
as
i
had
only
eaten
a
few
oysters
with
the
paduan
girls
she
could
scarcely
contain
her
joy
at
my
recovery
and
bade
me
kiss
her
with
which
request
i
complied
gladly
all
unworthy
though
i
felt
of
so
great
a
favour
i
am
going
to
tell
you
an
important
piece
of
news
said
she
and
that
is
that
i
am
sure
that
you
do
not
invent
the
answers
to
your
oracle
or
at
least
that
you
only
do
so
when
you
choose
the
reply
you
procured
me
was
divine
for
it
told
me
of
a
secret
unknown
to
all
even
to
myself
you
may
imagine
my
surprise
when
i
convinced
myself
with
no
little
trouble
of
the
truth
of
the
answer
you
possess
a
treasure
your
oracle
is
infallible
but
surely
it
can
never
lie
and
my
oracle
tells
me
that
you
love
me
it
makes
me
glad
to
know
that
for
you
are
the
man
of
my
heart
but
i
want
you
to
give
me
an
exemplary
proof
of
your
love
and
if
you
do
love
me
you
will
not
hesitate
to
do
so
stay
read
the
reply
you
got
me
i
am
sure
you
do
not
know
what
it
says
then
i
will
tell
you
how
you
can
make
me
quite
happy
i
pretended
to
read
and
kissed
the
words
which
declared
i
loved
her
i
am
delighted
said
i
that
the
oracle
has
convinced
you
so
easily
but
i
must
be
excused
if
i
say
that
i
believe
you
knew
as
much
long
ago
she
replied
blushing
that
if
it
were
possible
to
chew
me
the
object
in
question
i
should
not
wonder
at
her
ignorance
then
coming
to
the
proof
of
my
love
she
told
me
that
she
wanted
me
to
communicate
the
secret
to
her
you
love
me
said
she
and
you
ought
to
make
no
difficulty
in
assuring
the
bliss
of
a
girl
who
will
be
your
wife
and
in
your
power
my
father
will
agree
to
our
marriage
and
when
i
become
your
wife
i
will
do
whatever
you
please
we
will
even
go
and
live
in
another
country
if
that
would
add
to
your
happiness
but
you
must
teach
me
how
to
obtain
the
answer
to
any
question
without
inventing
it
myself
i
took
esther
hands
in
mine
she
inspired
me
with
the
tenderest
feelings
and
i
kissed
her
hands
with
respectful
fervour
saying
you
know
esther
dear
that
my
word
is
passed
at
paris
certainly
manon
is
not
to
be
compared
to
you
but
for
all
that
i
gave
my
promise
to
her
poor
mother
and
i
must
keep
it
a
sigh
escaped
from
esther
and
her
head
fell
upon
her
breast
but
what
could
i
do
i
could
not
teach
her
any
other
way
of
consulting
the
oracle
than
the
method
she
understood
as
well
as
i
my
superiority
over
her
only
consisting
in
my
greater
craft
and
more
extensive
experience
early
one
morning
two
or
three
days
later
a
man
was
announced
as
wanting
to
see
me
he
called
himself
an
officer
but
his
name
was
perfectly
unknown
to
me
i
sent
down
to
say
that
i
could
not
see
him
and
as
soon
as
my
spaniard
went
out
i
locked
my
door
what
had
happened
already
had
made
me
suspicious
and
i
did
not
care
to
see
any
more
gentlemen
alone
the
two
scoundrels
who
had
robbed
me
had
eluded
all
the
snares
of
the
police
and
piccolomini
was
not
to
be
found
but
i
knew
a
good
many
of
the
gang
were
still
in
amsterdam
and
i
thought
it
well
to
be
on
my
guard
some
time
after
le
duc
came
in
with
a
letter
written
in
bad
italian
saying
that
it
had
been
given
him
by
an
officer
who
was
waiting
for
an
answer
i
opened
it
and
recognized
the
name
i
had
heard
a
short
while
ago
the
writer
said
we
knew
each
other
but
that
he
could
only
give
his
true
name
with
his
own
lips
and
that
he
had
important
information
to
give
me
i
told
le
duc
to
shew
him
in
and
to
stay
by
the
door
i
saw
enter
a
man
of
about
forty
dressed
in
the
uniform
of
an
officer
of
i
do
not
know
what
army
and
bearing
on
his
countenance
all
the
marks
of
an
escaped
what
can
i
do
for
you
sir
said
i
as
soon
as
he
entered
sir
we
knew
each
other
at
cerigo
sixteen
or
seventeen
years
ago
and
i
am
delighted
to
have
an
opportunity
of
renewing
the
acquaintance
i
knew
that
i
had
spent
but
a
few
minutes
at
cerigo
on
my
way
to
constantinople
and
concluded
that
my
visitor
must
be
one
of
the
unfortunate
wretches
to
whom
i
gave
alms
are
you
the
man
i
said
who
told
me
that
you
were
the
son
of
a
count
peccini
of
padua
although
there
is
no
such
count
in
padua
at
all
i
congratulate
you
on
your
excellent
memory
said
he
coolly
i
am
that
very
individual
well
what
do
you
want
with
me
now
i
ca
divulge
my
business
in
the
presence
of
your
servant
my
servant
does
not
understand
italian
so
you
can
speak
out
however
if
you
like
i
will
send
him
away
i
ordered
le
duc
to
stay
in
the
and
when
he
had
left
the
room
my
paduan
count
told
me
that
i
had
been
with
his
nieces
and
had
treated
them
as
if
they
were
courtezans
and
that
he
was
come
to
demand
satisfaction
i
was
tired
of
being
cheated
and
i
took
hold
of
my
pistols
and
pointed
them
at
him
bidding
him
be
gone
instantly
le
duc
came
in
and
the
third
robber
took
himself
off
muttering
that
a
time
would
come
i
was
placed
in
a
disagreeable
position
if
i
wanted
to
prosecute
i
should
have
to
tell
the
whole
story
to
the
police
i
thought
of
my
honour
and
determined
to
be
silent
and
the
only
person
to
whom
i
mentioned
the
matter
was
rigerboos
who
not
being
in
the
same
position
as
myself
took
his
measures
the
result
of
which
was
that
lucie
had
to
send
her
dames
about
their
business
but
the
wretched
woman
came
to
me
to
say
that
this
misfortune
had
plunged
her
into
the
deepest
distress
so
i
made
her
a
present
of
a
few
ducats
and
she
went
away
somewhat
consoled
i
begged
her
not
to
call
on
me
again
everything
i
did
when
i
was
away
from
esther
seemed
to
turn
out
ill
and
i
felt
that
if
i
wanted
to
be
happy
i
should
do
well
to
keep
near
her
but
my
destiny
or
rather
my
inconstancy
drew
me
away
three
days
afterwards
the
villainous
major
sabi
called
on
me
to
warn
me
to
be
on
my
guard
as
according
to
his
account
a
venetian
officer
i
had
insulted
and
refused
to
give
satisfaction
to
had
vowed
vengeance
against
me
then
said
i
i
shall
have
him
arrested
as
an
escaped
galley
slave
in
which
character
i
have
given
him
alms
and
for
wearing
without
the
right
to
do
so
the
uniform
of
an
officer
thereby
disgracing
the
whole
army
and
pray
what
outrage
can
i
have
committed
against
girls
who
live
in
a
brothel
and
whom
i
have
paid
according
to
their
deserts
if
what
you
say
is
true
you
are
quite
right
but
this
poor
devil
is
in
a
desperate
situation
he
wants
to
leave
the
country
and
does
not
possess
a
single
florin
i
advise
you
to
give
him
an
alms
once
more
and
you
will
have
done
with
him
two
score
florins
will
not
make
you
any
the
poorer
and
will
rid
you
of
a
villainous
enemy
a
most
villainous
one
i
think
at
last
i
agreed
to
give
him
the
forty
florins
and
i
handed
them
to
him
in
a
where
the
major
told
me
i
should
find
him
the
reader
will
see
how
i
met
this
blackguard
four
months
later
now
when
all
these
troubles
have
been
long
over
and
i
can
think
over
them
calmly
reflecting
on
the
annoyances
i
experienced
at
amsterdam
where
i
might
have
been
so
happy
i
am
forced
to
admit
that
we
ourselves
are
the
authors
of
almost
all
our
woes
and
griefs
of
which
we
so
unreasonably
complain
if
i
could
live
my
life
over
again
should
i
be
wiser
perhaps
but
then
i
should
not
be
myself
asked
me
to
sup
with
him
at
the
burgomasters
lodge
and
this
was
a
great
distinction
for
contrary
to
the
rules
of
freemasonry
no
one
but
the
members
who
compose
the
lodge
is
admitted
and
these
masons
were
the
richest
men
on
the
exchange
i
have
told
them
that
you
are
coming
said
and
to
welcome
you
more
honourably
the
lodge
will
be
opened
in
french
in
short
these
gentlemen
gave
me
the
most
distinguished
reception
and
i
had
the
fortune
to
make
myself
so
agreeable
to
them
that
i
was
unanimously
chosen
an
honorary
member
during
the
time
i
should
stay
at
amsterdam
as
we
were
going
away
told
me
that
i
had
supped
with
a
company
which
represented
a
capital
of
three
hundred
millions
next
day
the
worthy
dutchman
begged
me
to
oblige
him
by
answering
a
question
to
which
his
daughter
oracle
had
replied
in
a
very
obscure
manner
esther
encouraged
me
and
i
asked
what
the
question
was
it
ran
as
follows
i
wish
to
know
whether
the
individual
who
desires
me
and
my
company
to
transact
a
matter
of
the
greatest
importance
is
really
a
friend
of
the
king
of
france
it
was
not
difficult
for
me
to
divine
that
the
comte
de
germain
was
meant
was
not
aware
that
i
knew
him
and
i
had
not
forgotten
what
had
told
me
here
a
fine
opportunity
thought
i
for
covering
my
oracle
with
glory
and
giving
my
fair
esther
something
to
think
about
i
set
to
work
and
after
erecting
my
pyramid
and
placing
above
the
four
keys
the
letters
o
s
a
d
the
better
to
impose
on
esther
i
extracted
the
reply
beginning
with
the
fourth
key
the
oracle
ran
as
follows
the
friend
disavows
the
order
is
signed
they
grant
they
refuse
all
vanishes
delay
i
pretended
to
think
the
reply
a
very
obscure
one
but
esther
gave
a
cry
of
astonishment
and
declared
that
it
gave
a
lot
of
information
in
an
extraordinary
style
in
an
ecstasy
of
delight
exclaimed
the
reply
is
clear
enough
for
me
the
oracle
is
divine
the
word
is
addressed
to
me
you
and
my
daughter
are
clever
enough
in
making
the
oracle
speak
but
i
am
more
skilled
than
you
in
the
interpretation
thereof
i
shall
prevent
the
thing
going
any
further
the
project
is
no
less
a
one
than
to
lend
a
hundred
millions
taking
in
pledge
the
diamonds
of
the
french
crown
the
king
wishes
the
loan
to
be
concluded
without
the
interference
of
his
ministers
and
without
their
even
knowing
anything
about
it
i
entreat
you
not
to
mention
the
matter
to
anyone
he
then
went
out
now
said
esther
when
we
were
by
ourselves
i
am
quite
sure
that
that
reply
came
from
another
intelligence
than
yours
in
the
name
of
all
you
hold
sacred
tell
me
the
meaning
of
those
four
letters
and
why
you
usually
omit
them
i
omit
them
dearest
esther
because
experience
has
taught
me
that
in
ordinary
cases
they
are
unnecessary
but
while
i
was
making
the
pyramid
the
command
came
to
me
to
set
them
down
and
i
thought
it
well
to
obey
what
do
they
mean
they
are
the
initial
letters
of
the
holy
names
of
the
cardinal
intelligences
of
the
four
quarters
of
the
world
i
may
not
tell
you
but
whoever
deals
with
the
oracle
should
know
them
ah
do
not
deceive
me
i
trust
in
you
and
it
would
be
worse
than
murder
to
abuse
so
simple
a
faith
as
mine
i
am
not
deceiving
you
dearest
esther
but
if
you
were
to
teach
me
the
cabala
you
would
impart
to
me
these
holy
names
certainly
but
i
can
not
reveal
them
except
to
my
successor
if
i
violate
this
command
i
should
lose
my
knowledge
and
this
condition
is
well
calculated
to
insure
secrecy
is
it
not
it
is
indeed
unhappy
that
i
am
your
successor
will
be
of
course
manon
no
manon
is
not
fitted
intellectually
for
such
knowledge
as
this
but
you
should
fix
on
someone
for
you
are
mortal
after
all
if
you
like
my
father
would
give
you
the
half
of
his
immense
fortune
without
your
marrying
me
esther
what
is
it
that
you
have
said
do
you
think
that
to
possess
you
would
be
a
disagreeable
condition
in
my
eyes
after
a
happy
day
i
think
i
may
call
it
the
happiest
of
my
life
i
left
the
too
charming
esther
and
went
home
towards
the
evening
three
or
four
days
after
came
into
esther
room
where
he
found
us
both
calculating
pyramids
i
was
teaching
her
to
double
to
triple
and
to
quadruple
the
cabalistic
combinations
strode
into
the
room
in
a
great
hurry
striking
his
breast
in
a
sort
of
ecstasy
we
were
surprised
and
almost
frightened
to
see
him
so
strangely
excited
and
rose
to
meet
him
but
he
running
up
to
us
almost
forced
us
to
embrace
him
which
we
did
willingly
but
what
is
the
matter
papa
dear
said
esther
you
surprise
me
more
than
i
can
say
sit
down
beside
me
my
dear
children
and
listen
to
your
father
and
your
best
friend
i
have
just
received
a
letter
from
one
of
the
secretaries
of
their
high
mightinesses
informing
me
that
the
french
ambassador
has
demanded
in
the
name
of
the
king
his
master
that
the
comte
germain
should
be
delivered
over
and
that
the
dutch
authorities
have
answered
that
his
most
christian
majesty
requests
shall
be
carried
out
as
soon
as
the
person
of
the
count
can
be
secured
in
consequence
of
this
the
police
knowing
that
the
comte
germain
was
staying
at
the
etoile
sent
to
arrest
him
at
midnight
but
the
bird
had
flown
the
landlord
declared
that
the
count
had
posted
off
at
nightfall
taking
the
way
to
nimeguen
he
has
been
followed
but
there
are
small
hopes
of
catching
him
up
it
is
not
known
how
he
can
have
discovered
that
a
warrant
existed
against
him
or
how
he
continued
to
evade
arrest
it
is
not
known
went
an
laughing
but
everyone
guesses
that
calcoen
the
same
that
wrote
to
me
let
this
friend
of
the
french
king
know
that
he
would
be
wanted
at
midnight
and
that
if
he
did
not
get
the
key
of
the
fields
he
would
be
arrested
he
is
not
so
foolish
as
to
despise
a
piece
of
advice
like
that
the
dutch
government
has
expressed
its
sorrow
to
that
his
excellence
did
not
demand
the
arrest
of
germain
sooner
and
the
ambassador
will
not
be
astonished
at
this
reply
as
it
is
like
many
others
given
on
similar
occasions
the
wisdom
of
the
oracle
has
been
verified
and
i
congratulate
myself
on
having
seized
its
meaning
for
we
were
on
the
point
of
giving
him
a
hundred
thousand
florins
on
account
which
he
said
he
must
have
immediately
he
gave
us
in
pledge
the
finest
of
the
crown
diamonds
and
this
we
still
retain
but
we
will
return
it
to
him
an
demand
unless
it
is
claimed
by
the
ambassador
i
have
never
seen
a
finer
stone
and
now
my
children
you
see
what
i
owe
to
the
oracle
on
the
exchange
the
whole
company
can
do
nothing
but
express
their
gratitude
to
me
i
am
regarded
as
the
most
prudent
and
most
farseeing
man
in
holland
to
you
my
dear
children
i
owe
this
honour
but
i
wear
my
peacock
feathers
without
scruple
my
dear
casanova
you
will
dine
with
us
i
hope
after
dinner
i
shall
beg
you
to
enquire
of
your
inscrutable
intelligence
whether
we
ought
to
declare
ourselves
in
possession
of
the
splendid
diamond
or
to
observe
secrecy
till
it
is
reclaimed
after
this
discourse
papa
embraced
us
once
more
and
left
us
sweetheart
said
esther
throwing
her
arms
round
my
neck
you
have
an
opportunity
for
giving
me
a
strong
proof
of
your
friendship
it
will
cost
you
nothing
but
it
will
cover
me
with
honour
and
happiness
command
me
and
it
shall
be
done
you
can
not
think
that
i
would
refuse
you
a
favour
which
is
to
cost
me
nothing
when
i
should
deem
myself
happy
to
shed
my
blood
for
your
sake
my
father
wishes
you
to
tell
him
after
dinner
whether
it
will
be
better
to
declare
that
they
have
the
diamond
or
to
keep
silence
till
it
is
claimed
when
he
asks
you
a
second
time
tell
him
to
seek
the
answer
of
me
and
offer
to
consult
the
oracle
also
in
case
my
answer
may
be
too
obscure
then
perform
the
operation
and
i
will
make
my
father
love
me
all
the
better
when
he
sees
that
my
knowledge
is
equal
to
yours
dearest
one
would
i
not
do
for
thee
a
task
a
thousand
times
more
difficult
than
this
to
prove
my
love
and
my
devotion
let
us
set
to
work
do
you
write
the
question
set
up
the
pyramids
and
inscribe
with
your
own
hand
the
initials
good
now
begin
to
extract
the
answer
by
means
of
the
divine
key
never
was
a
cleverer
pupil
when
all
this
had
been
done
i
suggested
the
additions
and
subtractions
i
wanted
made
and
she
was
quite
astonished
to
read
the
following
reply
silence
necessary
without
silence
general
derision
diamond
valueless
mere
paste
i
thought
she
would
have
gone
wild
with
delight
she
laughed
and
laughed
again
what
an
amazing
reply
said
she
the
diamond
is
false
and
it
is
i
who
am
about
to
reveal
their
folly
to
them
i
shall
inform
my
father
of
this
important
secret
it
is
too
much
it
overwhelms
me
i
can
scarcely
contain
myself
for
joy
how
much
i
owe
you
you
wonderful
and
delightful
man
they
will
verify
the
truth
of
the
oracle
immediately
and
when
it
is
found
that
the
famous
diamond
is
but
glittering
paste
the
company
will
adore
my
father
for
it
will
feel
that
but
for
him
it
would
have
been
covered
with
shame
by
avowing
itself
the
dupe
of
a
sharper
will
you
leave
the
pyramid
with
me
certainly
but
it
will
not
teach
you
anything
you
do
not
know
the
father
came
in
again
and
we
had
dinner
and
after
the
dessert
when
the
worthy
d
learnt
from
his
daughter
oracle
that
the
stone
was
false
the
scene
became
a
truly
comical
one
he
burst
into
exclamations
of
astonishment
declared
the
thing
impossible
incredible
and
at
last
begged
me
to
ask
the
same
question
as
he
was
quite
sure
that
his
daughter
was
mistaken
or
rather
that
the
oracle
was
deluding
her
i
set
to
work
and
was
not
long
in
obtaining
my
answer
when
he
saw
that
it
was
to
the
same
effect
as
esther
though
differently
expressed
he
had
no
longer
any
doubts
as
to
his
daughter
skill
and
hastened
to
go
and
test
the
pretended
diamond
and
to
advise
his
associates
to
say
nothing
about
the
matter
after
they
had
received
proofs
of
the
worthlessness
of
the
stone
this
advice
was
as
it
happened
useless
for
though
the
persons
concerned
said
nothing
everybody
knew
about
it
and
people
said
with
their
usual
malice
that
the
dupes
had
been
duped
most
thoroughly
and
that
germain
had
pocketed
the
hundred
thousand
florins
but
this
was
not
the
case
esther
was
very
proud
of
her
success
but
instead
of
being
satisfied
with
what
she
had
done
she
desired
more
fervently
every
day
to
possess
the
science
in
its
entirety
as
she
supposed
i
possessed
it
it
soon
became
known
that
germain
had
gone
by
emden
and
had
embarked
for
england
where
he
had
arrived
in
safety
in
due
time
we
shall
hear
some
further
details
concerning
this
celebrated
impostor
and
in
the
meanwhile
i
must
relate
a
catastrophe
of
another
kind
which
was
near
to
have
made
me
die
the
death
of
a
fool
it
was
christmas
day
i
had
got
up
early
in
the
morning
in
better
spirits
than
usual
the
old
women
tell
you
that
always
presages
misfortune
but
i
was
as
far
then
as
i
am
now
from
making
my
happiness
into
an
omen
of
grief
but
this
time
chance
made
the
foolish
belief
of
good
effect
i
received
a
letter
and
a
large
packet
from
paris
they
came
from
manon
i
opened
the
letter
and
i
thought
i
should
have
died
of
grief
when
i
read
be
wise
and
receive
the
news
i
give
you
calmly
the
packet
contains
your
portrait
and
all
the
letters
you
have
written
to
me
return
me
my
portrait
and
if
you
have
kept
my
letters
be
kind
enough
to
burn
them
i
rely
on
your
honour
think
of
me
no
more
duty
bids
me
do
all
i
can
to
forget
you
for
at
this
hour
i
shall
become
the
wife
of
blondel
of
the
royal
academy
architect
to
the
king
please
do
not
seem
as
if
you
knew
me
if
we
chance
to
meet
on
your
return
to
paris
this
letter
struck
me
dumb
with
astonishment
and
for
more
than
two
hours
after
i
read
it
i
was
as
it
were
bereft
of
my
senses
i
sent
word
to
that
not
feeling
well
i
was
going
to
keep
my
room
all
day
when
i
felt
a
little
better
i
opened
the
packet
the
first
thing
to
fall
out
was
my
portrait
i
looked
at
it
and
such
was
the
perturbation
of
my
mind
that
though
the
miniature
really
represented
me
as
of
a
cheerful
and
animated
expression
i
thought
i
beheld
a
dreadful
and
a
threatening
visage
i
went
to
my
desk
and
wrote
and
tore
up
a
score
of
letters
in
which
i
overwhelmed
the
faithless
one
with
threats
and
reproaches
i
could
bear
no
more
the
forces
of
nature
were
exhausted
and
i
was
obliged
to
lie
down
and
take
a
little
broth
and
court
that
sleep
which
refused
to
come
a
thousand
designs
came
to
my
disordered
imagination
i
rejected
them
one
by
one
only
to
devise
new
ones
i
would
slay
this
blondel
who
had
carried
off
a
woman
who
was
mine
and
mine
only
who
was
all
but
my
wife
her
treachery
should
be
punished
by
her
losing
the
object
for
whom
she
had
deserted
me
i
accused
her
father
i
cursed
her
brother
for
having
left
me
in
ignorance
of
the
insult
which
had
so
traitorously
been
put
upon
me
i
spent
the
day
and
night
in
these
delirious
thoughts
and
in
the
morning
feeling
worse
than
ever
i
sent
to
to
say
that
i
could
not
possibly
leave
my
room
then
i
began
to
read
and
the
letters
i
had
written
to
manon
calling
upon
her
name
in
a
sort
of
frenzy
and
again
set
myself
to
write
to
her
without
finishing
a
single
letter
the
emptiness
of
my
stomach
and
the
shock
i
had
undergone
began
to
stupefy
me
and
for
a
few
moments
i
forgot
my
anguish
only
to
to
acuter
pains
soon
after
about
three
the
worthy
came
to
invite
me
to
go
with
him
to
the
hague
where
the
chief
masons
of
holland
met
on
the
day
following
to
keep
the
feast
of
john
but
when
he
saw
my
condition
he
did
not
press
me
to
come
what
is
the
matter
with
you
my
dear
casanova
said
he
i
have
had
a
great
grief
but
let
us
say
no
more
about
it
he
begged
me
to
come
and
see
esther
and
left
me
looking
almost
as
downcast
as
i
was
however
the
next
morning
esther
anticipated
my
visit
for
at
nine
she
and
her
governess
came
into
the
room
the
sight
of
her
did
me
good
she
was
astonished
to
see
me
so
undone
and
cast
down
and
asked
me
what
was
the
grief
of
which
i
had
spoken
to
her
father
and
which
had
proved
too
strong
for
my
philosophy
sit
down
beside
me
esther
dear
and
allow
me
to
make
a
mystery
of
what
has
affected
me
so
grievously
time
the
mighty
healer
and
still
more
your
company
will
effect
a
cure
which
i
should
in
vain
seek
by
appealing
to
my
reason
whilst
we
talk
of
other
things
i
shall
not
feel
the
misfortune
which
gnaws
at
my
heart
well
get
up
dress
yourself
and
come
and
spend
the
day
with
me
and
i
will
do
my
best
to
make
you
forget
your
sorrow
i
feel
very
weak
for
the
last
three
days
i
have
only
taken
a
little
broth
and
chocolate
at
these
words
her
face
fell
and
she
began
to
weep
after
a
moment
silence
she
went
to
my
desk
took
a
pen
and
wrote
a
few
lines
which
she
brought
to
me
they
were
dear
if
a
large
sum
of
money
beyond
what
my
father
owes
you
can
remove
or
even
soothe
your
grief
i
can
be
your
doctor
and
you
ought
to
know
that
your
accepting
my
treatment
would
make
me
happy
i
took
her
hands
and
kissed
them
affectionately
saying
no
dear
esther
generous
esther
it
is
not
money
i
want
for
if
i
did
i
would
ask
you
and
your
father
as
a
friend
what
i
want
and
what
no
one
can
give
me
is
a
resolute
mind
and
determination
to
act
for
the
best
ask
advice
of
your
oracle
i
could
not
help
laughing
why
do
you
laugh
said
she
if
i
am
not
mistaken
the
oracle
must
know
a
remedy
for
your
woes
i
laughed
dearest
because
i
felt
inclined
to
tell
you
to
consult
the
oracle
this
time
as
for
me
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
lest
the
cure
be
worse
than
the
disease
but
you
need
not
follow
your
advice
unless
you
like
it
no
one
is
free
to
act
as
one
thinks
fit
but
not
to
follow
the
advice
of
the
oracle
would
be
a
contempt
of
the
intelligence
which
directs
it
esther
could
say
no
more
and
stood
silent
for
several
minutes
and
then
said
that
if
i
like
she
would
stay
with
me
for
the
rest
of
the
day
the
joy
which
illumined
my
countenance
was
manifest
and
i
said
that
if
she
would
stay
to
dinner
i
would
get
up
and
no
doubt
her
presence
would
give
me
an
appetite
ah
said
she
i
will
make
you
the
dish
you
are
so
fond
of
she
ordered
the
to
be
sent
back
and
went
to
my
landlady
to
order
an
appetising
repast
and
to
procure
the
and
the
spirits
of
wine
she
required
for
her
own
cooking
esther
was
an
angel
a
treasure
who
consented
to
become
mine
if
i
would
communicate
to
her
a
science
which
did
not
exist
i
felt
that
i
was
looking
forward
to
spending
a
happy
day
this
shewed
me
that
i
could
forget
manon
and
i
was
delighted
with
the
idea
i
got
out
of
bed
and
when
esther
came
back
and
found
me
on
my
feet
she
gave
a
skip
of
pleasure
now
said
she
you
must
oblige
me
by
dressing
and
doing
your
hair
as
if
you
were
going
to
a
ball
that
i
answered
is
a
funny
idea
but
as
it
pleases
you
it
pleases
me
i
rang
for
le
duc
and
told
him
i
wanted
to
have
my
hair
done
and
to
be
dressed
as
if
i
were
going
to
a
ball
choose
the
dress
that
suits
me
best
no
said
esther
i
will
choose
it
myself
le
duc
opened
my
trunk
and
leaving
her
to
rummage
in
it
he
came
to
shave
me
and
to
do
my
hair
esther
delighted
with
her
task
called
in
the
assistance
of
her
governess
she
put
on
my
bed
a
lace
shirt
and
the
suit
she
found
most
to
her
taste
then
coming
close
as
if
to
see
whether
le
duc
was
dressing
my
hair
properly
she
said
a
little
broth
would
do
you
good
send
for
a
dish
it
will
give
you
an
appetite
for
dinner
i
thought
her
advice
dictated
by
the
tenderest
care
and
i
determined
to
benefit
by
it
so
great
was
the
influence
of
this
charming
girl
over
me
that
little
by
little
instead
of
loving
manon
i
hated
her
that
gave
me
courage
and
completed
my
cure
at
the
present
time
i
can
see
that
manon
was
very
wise
in
accepting
blondel
offer
and
that
my
love
for
self
and
not
my
love
for
her
was
wounded
i
was
in
my
servant
hands
my
face
turned
away
towards
the
fire
so
that
i
could
not
see
esther
but
only
divert
myself
with
the
idea
that
she
was
inspecting
my
belongings
when
all
at
once
she
presented
herself
with
a
melancholy
air
holding
mamon
fatal
letter
in
her
hand
am
i
to
blame
said
she
timidly
for
having
discovered
the
cause
of
your
sorrow
i
felt
rather
taken
aback
but
looking
kindly
at
her
i
said
no
no
my
dear
esther
pity
your
friend
and
say
no
more
about
it
then
i
may
read
all
the
letters
yes
dearest
if
it
will
amuse
you
all
the
letters
of
the
faithless
manon
baletti
to
me
with
mine
to
her
were
together
on
my
table
i
pointed
them
out
to
esther
who
begun
to
read
them
quite
eagerly
when
i
was
dressed
as
if
for
some
court
holiday
le
duc
went
out
and
left
us
by
ourselves
for
the
worthy
governess
who
was
working
at
her
lace
by
the
window
looked
at
her
lace
and
nothing
else
esther
said
that
nothing
had
ever
amused
her
so
much
as
those
letters
those
cursed
epistles
which
please
you
so
well
will
be
the
death
of
me
death
oh
no
i
will
cure
you
i
hope
i
hope
so
too
but
after
dinner
you
must
help
me
to
burn
them
all
from
first
to
last
burn
them
no
make
me
a
present
of
them
i
promise
to
keep
them
carefully
all
my
days
they
are
yours
esther
i
will
send
them
to
you
these
letters
were
more
than
two
hundred
in
number
and
the
shortest
were
four
pages
in
length
she
was
enchanted
to
find
herself
the
possessor
of
the
letters
and
she
said
she
would
make
them
into
a
parcel
and
take
them
away
herself
shall
you
send
back
the
portrait
to
your
faithless
mistress
said
she
i
do
know
what
to
do
with
it
send
it
back
to
her
she
is
not
worthy
of
your
honouring
her
by
keeping
it
i
am
sure
that
your
oracle
would
give
you
the
same
advice
where
is
the
portrait
will
you
shew
it
me
i
had
the
portrait
in
the
interior
of
a
gold
but
i
had
never
shewn
it
to
esther
for
fear
she
should
think
manon
handsomer
than
herself
and
conclude
that
i
only
shewd
it
her
out
of
vanity
but
as
she
now
asked
to
see
it
i
opened
the
box
where
it
was
and
gave
it
her
any
other
woman
besides
esther
would
have
pronounced
manon
downright
ugly
or
have
endeavored
at
the
least
to
find
some
fault
with
her
but
esther
pronounced
her
to
be
very
beautiful
and
only
said
it
was
a
great
pity
so
fair
a
body
contained
so
vile
a
soul
the
sight
of
manon
portrait
made
esther
ask
to
see
all
the
other
portraits
which
madame
manzoni
had
sent
me
from
venice
there
were
naked
figures
amongst
them
but
esther
was
too
pure
a
spirit
to
put
on
the
hateful
affectations
of
the
prude
to
whom
everything
natural
is
an
abomination
pleased
her
very
much
and
her
history
which
i
related
struck
her
as
very
curious
the
portrait
of
the
fair
nun
m
m
first
in
the
habit
of
her
order
and
afterwards
naked
made
her
laugh
but
i
would
not
tell
esther
her
story
in
spite
of
the
lively
desire
she
displayed
to
hear
it
at
a
delicate
repast
was
brought
to
us
and
we
spent
two
delightful
hours
in
the
pleasures
of
a
conversation
and
the
table
i
seemed
to
have
passed
from
death
to
life
and
esther
was
delighted
to
have
been
my
physician
before
we
rose
from
table
i
had
declared
my
intention
of
sending
manon
portrait
to
her
husband
on
the
day
following
but
her
good
nature
found
a
way
of
dissuading
me
from
doing
so
without
much
difficulty
some
time
after
while
we
were
talking
in
front
of
the
fire
she
took
a
piece
of
paper
set
up
the
pyramids
and
inscribed
the
four
keys
o
s
a
she
asked
if
i
should
send
the
portrait
to
the
husband
or
whether
it
would
not
be
more
generous
to
return
it
to
the
faithless
manon
whilst
she
was
calculating
she
said
over
and
over
again
with
a
smile
i
have
not
made
up
the
answer
i
pretend
to
believe
her
and
we
laughed
like
two
augurs
meeting
each
other
alone
at
last
the
reply
came
that
i
ought
to
return
the
portrait
but
to
the
giver
since
to
send
it
to
the
husband
would
be
an
act
unworthy
of
a
man
of
honour
i
praised
the
wisdom
of
the
oracle
and
kissed
the
pythoness
a
score
of
times
promising
that
the
cabala
should
be
obeyed
implicitly
adding
that
she
had
no
need
of
being
taught
the
science
since
she
knew
it
as
well
as
the
inventor
i
spoke
the
truth
but
esther
laughed
and
fearing
lest
i
should
really
think
so
took
pains
to
assure
me
of
the
contrary
it
is
thus
that
love
takes
his
pleasure
thus
his
growth
increases
and
thus
that
he
so
soon
becomes
a
giant
in
strength
shall
i
be
impertinent
said
esther
if
i
ask
you
where
your
portrait
is
manon
says
in
her
letter
that
she
is
sending
it
back
but
i
see
it
anywhere
in
my
first
paroxysm
of
rage
i
threw
it
down
i
do
know
in
what
direction
what
was
thus
despised
by
her
can
not
be
of
much
value
to
me
let
us
look
for
it
i
should
like
to
see
it
we
soon
found
it
on
my
table
in
the
midst
of
a
of
books
esther
said
it
was
a
speaking
likeness
i
would
give
it
you
if
such
a
present
were
worthy
of
you
ah
you
could
not
give
me
anything
i
would
value
more
will
you
deign
to
accept
it
esther
though
it
has
been
possessed
by
another
it
will
be
all
the
dearer
to
me
at
last
she
had
to
leave
me
after
a
day
which
might
be
called
delightful
if
happiness
consists
of
calm
and
mutual
joys
without
the
tumultuous
raptures
of
passion
she
went
away
at
ten
after
i
had
promised
to
spend
the
whole
of
the
next
day
with
her
after
an
unbroken
sleep
of
nine
hours
duration
i
got
up
refreshed
and
feeling
once
more
in
perfect
health
and
i
went
to
see
esther
immediately
i
found
she
was
still
abed
and
asleep
but
her
governess
went
and
roused
her
in
spite
of
my
request
that
her
repose
should
be
respected
she
received
me
with
a
sweet
smile
as
she
sat
up
in
bed
and
shewd
me
my
voluminous
correspondence
with
manon
on
her
saying
that
she
had
been
reading
it
till
two
in
the
morning
her
appearance
was
ravishing
a
pretty
cambric
tied
with
a
ribbon
and
ornamented
with
lace
set
off
the
beauties
of
her
face
and
a
light
shawl
of
indian
muslin
which
she
had
hastily
thrown
on
veiled
rather
than
concealed
her
snowy
breast
which
would
have
shamed
the
works
of
praxiteles
she
allowed
me
to
take
a
hundred
kisses
on
her
rosy
lips
ardent
kisses
which
the
sight
of
such
charms
made
yet
more
ardent
but
her
hands
forbade
my
approach
to
those
two
spheres
i
so
longed
to
touch
i
sat
down
by
her
and
told
her
that
her
charms
of
body
and
mind
would
make
a
man
forget
all
the
manons
that
ever
were
is
your
marion
fair
to
see
all
over
said
she
i
really
ca
say
for
not
being
her
husband
i
never
had
an
opportunity
of
investigating
the
matter
your
discretion
is
worthy
of
all
praise
she
said
with
a
smile
such
conduct
becomes
a
man
of
delicate
feeling
i
was
told
by
her
nurse
that
she
was
perfect
in
all
respects
and
that
no
mote
or
blemish
relieved
the
pure
whiteness
of
her
skin
you
must
have
a
different
notion
of
me
yes
esther
as
the
oracle
revealed
to
me
the
great
secret
you
desired
to
know
nevertheless
i
should
find
you
perfect
in
all
your
parts
hereupon
i
was
guilty
of
a
stupidity
which
turned
to
my
confusion
i
said
if
i
became
your
husband
i
could
easily
refrain
from
touching
you
there
i
suppose
you
think
said
she
blushing
and
evidently
a
little
vexed
that
if
you
touched
it
your
desires
might
be
lessened
this
question
probed
me
to
the
core
and
covered
me
with
shame
i
burst
into
tears
and
begged
her
pardon
in
so
truly
repentant
a
voice
that
sympathy
made
her
mingle
her
tears
with
mine
the
incident
only
increased
our
intimacy
for
as
i
kissed
her
tears
away
the
same
desires
consumed
us
and
if
the
voice
of
prudence
had
not
intervened
doubtless
all
would
have
been
over
as
it
was
we
had
but
a
foretaste
and
an
earnest
of
that
bliss
which
it
was
in
our
power
to
procure
three
hours
seemed
to
us
as
many
minutes
she
begged
me
to
go
into
her
while
she
dressed
and
we
then
went
down
and
dined
with
the
wretched
secretary
who
adored
her
whom
she
did
not
love
and
who
must
have
borne
small
love
to
me
seeing
how
high
i
stood
in
her
graces
we
passed
the
rest
of
the
day
together
in
that
confidential
talk
which
is
usual
when
the
foundations
of
the
most
intimate
friendship
have
been
laid
between
two
persons
of
opposite
sex
who
believe
themselves
created
for
each
other
our
flames
burnt
as
brightly
but
with
more
restraint
in
the
as
in
the
bedroom
in
the
very
air
of
the
bedroom
of
a
woman
one
loves
there
is
something
so
balmy
and
voluptuous
that
the
lover
asked
to
choose
between
this
garden
of
delights
and
paradise
would
not
for
one
moment
hesitate
in
his
choice
we
parted
with
hearts
full
of
happiness
saying
to
each
other
till
i
was
truly
in
love
with
esther
for
my
sentiment
for
her
was
composed
of
sweeter
calmer
and
more
lively
feelings
than
mere
sensual
love
which
is
ever
stormy
and
violent
i
felt
sure
i
could
persuade
her
to
marry
me
without
my
first
teaching
her
what
could
not
be
taught
i
was
sorry
i
had
not
let
her
think
herself
as
clever
as
myself
in
the
cabala
and
i
feared
it
would
be
impossible
to
undeceive
her
without
exciting
her
to
anger
which
would
cast
out
love
nevertheless
esther
was
the
only
woman
who
would
make
me
forget
manon
whom
i
began
to
think
unworthy
of
all
i
had
proposed
doing
for
her
came
back
and
i
went
to
dine
with
him
he
was
pleased
to
hear
that
his
daughter
had
effected
a
complete
cure
by
spending
a
day
with
me
when
we
were
alone
he
told
me
that
he
had
heard
at
the
hague
that
the
comte
germain
had
the
art
of
making
diamonds
which
only
differed
from
the
real
ones
in
weight
and
which
according
to
him
would
make
his
fortune
would
have
been
amused
if
i
had
told
him
all
i
knew
about
this
charlatan
next
day
i
took
esther
to
the
concert
and
while
we
were
there
she
told
me
that
on
the
day
following
she
would
not
leave
her
room
so
that
we
could
talk
about
getting
married
without
fear
of
interruption
this
was
the
last
day
of
the
year
chapter
xi
i
undeceive
esther
i
set
out
for
germany
adventure
near
cologne
the
burgomaster
wife
my
conquest
of
her
ball
at
bonn
welcome
from
the
elector
of
cologne
breakfast
at
bruhl
first
intimacy
i
sup
without
being
asked
at
general
kettler
i
am
happy
i
leave
cologne
the
toscani
the
jewel
my
arrival
at
stuttgart
the
appointment
which
esther
had
made
with
me
would
probably
have
serious
results
and
i
felt
it
due
to
my
honour
not
to
deceive
her
any
longer
even
were
it
to
cost
me
my
happiness
however
i
had
some
hope
that
all
would
turn
out
well
i
found
her
in
bed
and
she
told
me
that
she
intended
to
stop
there
throughout
the
day
i
approved
for
in
bed
i
thought
her
ravishing
we
will
set
to
work
said
she
and
her
governess
set
a
little
table
by
her
bed
and
she
gave
me
a
piece
of
paper
covered
with
questions
tending
to
convince
me
that
before
i
married
her
i
should
communicate
to
her
my
supposed
science
all
these
questions
were
artfully
conceived
all
were
so
worded
as
to
force
the
oracle
to
order
me
to
satisfy
her
or
to
definitely
forbid
my
doing
so
i
saw
the
snare
and
all
my
thoughts
were
how
to
avoid
it
though
i
pretended
to
be
merely
considering
the
questions
i
could
not
make
the
oracle
speak
to
please
esther
and
i
could
still
less
make
it
pronounce
a
positive
prohibition
as
i
feared
that
she
would
resent
such
an
answer
bitterly
and
revenge
herself
on
me
nevertheless
i
had
to
assume
an
indifferent
air
and
i
got
myself
out
of
the
difficulty
by
equivocal
answers
till
the
papa
came
to
summon
me
to
dinner
he
allowed
his
daughter
to
stay
in
bed
on
the
condition
that
she
was
to
do
no
more
work
as
he
was
afraid
that
by
applying
herself
so
intently
she
would
increase
her
headache
she
promised
much
to
my
delight
that
he
should
be
obeyed
but
on
my
return
from
dinner
i
found
her
asleep
and
sitting
at
her
bedside
i
let
her
sleep
on
when
she
awoke
she
said
she
would
like
to
read
a
little
and
as
if
by
inspiration
i
chanced
to
take
up
coiardeau
and
we
inflamed
each
other
by
reading
the
letters
of
heloise
and
abelard
the
ardours
thus
aroused
passed
into
our
talk
and
we
began
to
discuss
the
secret
which
the
oracle
had
revealed
but
esther
dear
said
i
did
not
the
oracle
reveal
a
circumstance
of
which
you
knew
perfectly
well
before
no
sweetheart
the
secret
was
perfectly
unknown
to
me
and
would
have
continued
unknown
then
you
have
never
been
curious
enough
to
inspect
your
own
person
however
curious
i
may
have
been
nature
placed
that
mole
in
such
a
position
as
to
escape
any
but
the
most
minute
search
you
have
never
felt
it
then
it
is
too
small
to
be
felt
i
do
believe
it
she
allowed
my
hand
to
wander
indiscreetly
and
my
happy
fingers
felt
all
the
precincts
of
the
temple
of
love
this
was
enough
to
fire
the
chastest
disposition
i
could
not
find
the
object
of
my
research
and
not
wishing
to
stop
short
at
so
vain
an
enjoyment
i
was
allowed
to
convince
myself
with
my
eyes
that
it
actually
existed
there
however
her
concessions
stopped
short
and
i
had
to
content
myself
by
kissing
again
and
again
all
those
parts
which
modesty
no
longer
denied
to
my
gaze
satiated
with
bliss
though
i
had
not
attained
to
the
utmost
of
enjoyment
which
she
wisely
denied
me
after
two
hours
had
been
devoted
to
those
pastimes
which
lead
to
nothing
i
resolved
to
tell
her
the
whole
truth
and
to
shew
her
how
i
had
abused
her
trust
in
me
though
i
feared
that
her
anger
would
be
roused
esther
who
had
a
large
share
of
intelligence
indeed
if
she
had
had
less
i
could
not
have
deceived
her
so
well
listened
to
me
without
interrupting
me
and
without
any
signs
of
anger
or
astonishment
at
last
when
i
had
brought
my
long
and
sincere
confession
to
an
end
she
said
i
know
your
love
for
me
is
as
great
as
mine
for
you
and
if
i
am
certain
that
what
you
have
just
said
can
not
possibly
be
true
i
am
forced
to
conclude
that
if
you
do
not
communicate
to
me
all
the
secrets
of
your
science
it
is
because
to
do
so
is
not
in
your
power
let
us
love
one
another
till
death
and
say
no
more
about
this
matter
after
a
moment
silence
she
went
on
if
love
has
taken
away
from
you
the
courage
of
sincerity
i
forgive
you
but
i
am
sorry
for
you
you
have
given
me
too
positive
proof
of
the
reality
of
your
science
to
be
able
to
shake
my
belief
you
could
never
have
found
out
a
thing
of
which
i
myself
was
ignorant
and
of
which
no
mortal
man
could
know
and
if
i
shew
you
esther
dear
that
i
knew
you
had
this
mole
that
i
had
good
reasons
for
supposing
you
to
be
ignorant
of
it
will
your
belief
be
shaken
then
you
knew
it
how
could
you
have
seen
it
it
incredible
i
will
tell
you
all
i
then
explained
to
her
the
theory
of
the
correspondence
of
moles
on
the
various
parts
of
the
human
body
and
to
convince
her
i
ended
by
saying
that
her
governess
who
had
a
large
mark
on
her
right
cheek
ought
to
have
one
very
like
it
on
her
left
thigh
at
this
she
burst
into
laughter
and
said
i
will
find
out
but
after
all
you
have
told
me
i
can
only
admire
you
the
more
for
knowing
what
no
one
else
does
do
you
really
think
esther
that
i
am
the
sole
possessor
of
this
science
undeceive
yourself
all
who
have
studied
anatomy
physiology
and
astrology
know
of
it
then
i
beg
you
to
get
me
by
yes
tomorrow
all
the
books
which
will
teach
me
secrets
of
that
nature
i
long
to
be
able
to
astonish
the
ignorant
with
my
cabala
which
i
see
requires
a
mixture
of
knowledge
and
imposition
i
wish
to
devote
myself
entirely
to
this
study
we
can
love
each
other
to
the
death
but
we
can
do
that
without
getting
married
i
my
lodging
in
a
peaceful
and
happy
frame
of
mind
an
enormous
weight
seemed
taken
off
my
spirits
next
morning
i
purchased
such
volumes
as
i
judged
would
instruct
and
amuse
her
at
the
same
time
and
went
to
present
them
to
her
she
was
most
pleased
with
my
conis
as
she
found
in
it
the
character
of
truth
as
she
wished
to
shine
by
her
answers
through
the
oracle
it
was
necessary
for
her
to
have
an
extensive
knowledge
of
science
and
i
put
her
on
the
way
about
that
time
i
conceived
the
idea
of
making
a
short
tour
in
germany
before
returning
to
paris
and
esther
encouraged
me
to
do
so
after
i
had
promised
that
she
should
see
me
again
before
the
end
of
the
year
this
promise
was
sincerely
given
and
though
from
that
day
to
this
i
have
not
beheld
the
face
of
that
charming
and
remarkable
woman
i
can
not
reproach
myself
with
having
deceived
her
wilfully
for
subsequent
events
prevented
me
from
keeping
my
word
i
wrote
to
requesting
him
to
procure
me
a
passport
through
the
empire
where
the
french
and
other
belligerent
powers
were
then
campaigning
he
answered
very
politely
that
i
had
no
need
of
a
passport
but
that
if
i
wished
to
have
one
he
would
send
it
me
forthwith
i
was
content
with
this
letter
and
put
it
among
my
papers
and
at
cologne
it
got
me
a
better
reception
than
all
the
passports
in
the
world
i
made
the
depositary
of
the
various
moneys
i
had
in
different
banking
houses
and
the
worthy
man
who
was
a
true
friend
to
me
gave
me
a
bill
of
exchange
on
a
dozen
of
the
chief
houses
in
germany
when
my
affairs
were
all
in
order
i
started
in
my
with
the
sum
of
nearly
a
hundred
thousand
dutch
florins
to
my
credit
some
valuable
jewels
and
a
wardrobe
i
sent
my
swiss
servant
back
to
paris
keeping
only
my
faithful
spaniard
who
on
this
occasion
travelled
with
me
seated
behind
my
chaise
thus
ends
the
history
of
my
second
visit
to
holland
where
i
did
nothing
to
augment
my
fortune
i
had
some
unpleasant
experiences
there
for
which
i
had
my
own
imprudence
to
thank
but
after
the
lapse
of
so
many
years
i
feel
that
these
mishaps
were
more
than
compensated
by
the
charms
of
esther
society
i
only
stopped
one
day
at
utrecht
and
two
days
after
i
reached
cologne
at
noon
without
accident
but
not
without
danger
for
at
a
distance
of
half
a
league
from
the
town
five
deserters
three
on
the
right
hand
and
two
on
the
left
levelled
their
pistols
at
me
with
the
words
your
money
or
your
life
however
i
covered
the
postillion
with
my
own
pistol
threatening
to
fire
if
he
did
not
drive
on
and
the
robbers
discharged
their
weapons
at
the
carriage
not
having
enough
spirit
to
shoot
the
postillion
if
i
had
been
like
the
english
who
carry
a
light
purse
for
the
benefit
of
the
highwaymen
i
would
have
thrown
it
to
these
poor
wretches
but
as
it
was
i
risked
my
life
rather
than
be
robbed
my
spaniard
was
quite
astonished
not
to
have
been
struck
by
any
of
the
balls
which
whistled
past
his
ears
the
french
were
in
winter
quarters
at
cologne
and
i
put
up
at
the
soleil
as
i
was
going
in
the
first
person
i
met
was
the
comte
de
lastic
madame
nephew
who
greeted
me
with
the
utmost
politeness
and
offered
to
take
me
to
de
torci
who
was
in
command
i
accepted
and
this
gentleman
was
quite
satisfied
with
the
letter
had
written
me
i
told
him
what
had
happened
to
me
as
i
was
coming
into
cologne
and
he
congratulated
me
on
the
happy
issue
of
the
affair
but
with
a
soldier
freedom
blamed
the
use
i
had
made
of
my
courage
you
played
high
said
he
to
save
your
money
but
you
might
have
lost
a
limb
and
nothing
would
have
made
up
for
that
i
answered
that
to
make
light
of
a
danger
often
diminished
it
we
laughed
at
this
and
he
said
that
if
i
was
going
to
make
any
stay
in
cologne
i
should
probably
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
highwaymen
hanged
i
intend
to
go
said
i
and
if
anything
could
keep
me
at
cologne
it
would
certainly
not
be
the
prospect
of
being
present
at
an
execution
as
such
sights
are
not
at
all
to
my
taste
i
had
to
accept
de
lastic
invitation
to
dinner
and
he
persuaded
me
to
go
with
himself
and
his
friend
de
flavacour
an
officer
of
high
rank
and
an
agreeable
man
to
the
theatre
as
i
felt
sure
that
i
should
be
introduced
to
ladies
and
wished
to
make
something
of
a
figure
i
spent
an
hour
in
dressing
i
found
myself
in
a
box
opposite
to
a
pretty
woman
who
looked
at
me
again
and
again
through
her
that
was
enough
to
rouse
my
curiosity
and
i
begged
de
lastic
to
introduce
me
which
he
did
with
the
best
grace
imaginable
he
first
presented
me
to
count
kettler
in
the
austrian
army
and
on
the
general
staff
of
the
french
army
just
as
the
french
general
montacet
was
on
the
staff
of
the
austrian
army
i
was
then
presented
to
the
lady
whose
beauty
had
attracted
my
attention
the
moment
i
entered
my
box
she
greeted
me
graciously
and
asked
me
questions
about
paris
and
brussels
where
she
had
been
educated
without
appearing
to
pay
any
attention
to
my
replies
but
gazing
at
my
lace
and
jewellery
while
we
were
talking
of
indifferent
matters
like
new
acquaintances
she
suddenly
but
politely
asked
me
if
i
intended
to
make
a
long
stay
in
cologne
i
think
of
crossing
the
rhine
i
answered
and
shall
probably
dine
at
bonn
this
reply
which
was
given
as
indifferently
as
her
question
appeared
to
vex
her
and
i
thought
her
vexation
a
good
omen
general
kettler
then
rose
saying
i
am
sure
sir
that
this
lady
will
persuade
you
to
delay
your
departure
at
least
i
hope
so
that
i
may
bane
the
pleasure
of
seeing
more
of
your
company
i
bowed
and
he
went
out
with
lastic
leaving
me
alone
with
this
ravishing
beauty
she
was
the
burgomaster
wife
and
the
general
was
nearly
always
with
her
is
the
count
right
said
she
pleasantly
in
attributing
such
power
to
me
i
think
so
indeed
i
answered
but
he
may
possibly
be
wrong
in
thinking
you
care
to
exercise
it
very
good
we
must
catch
him
then
if
only
as
the
punishment
of
his
indiscretion
stay
i
was
so
astonished
at
this
speech
that
i
looked
quite
foolish
and
had
to
collect
my
senses
i
thought
the
word
indiscretion
sublime
punishment
exquisite
and
catching
admirable
and
still
more
the
idea
of
catching
him
by
means
of
me
i
thought
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
enquire
any
further
and
putting
on
an
expression
of
resignation
and
gratitude
i
lowered
my
lips
and
kissed
her
hand
with
a
mixture
of
respect
and
sentiment
which
without
exactly
imparting
my
feelings
for
her
let
her
know
that
they
might
be
softened
without
much
difficulty
then
you
will
stay
sir
it
is
really
very
kind
of
you
for
if
you
went
off
people
might
say
that
you
only
came
here
to
shew
your
disdain
for
us
tomorrow
the
general
gives
a
ball
and
i
hope
you
will
be
one
of
the
party
can
i
hope
to
dance
with
you
all
the
evening
i
promise
to
dance
with
nobody
but
you
till
you
get
tired
of
me
then
we
shall
dance
together
through
all
the
ball
where
did
you
get
that
pomade
which
perfumes
the
air
i
smelt
it
as
soon
as
you
came
into
the
box
it
came
from
florence
and
if
you
do
not
like
it
you
shall
not
be
troubled
with
it
any
more
oh
but
i
do
like
it
i
should
like
some
of
it
myself
and
i
shall
be
only
too
happy
if
you
will
permit
me
to
send
you
a
little
just
then
the
door
of
the
box
opened
and
the
entrance
of
the
general
prevented
her
from
replying
i
was
just
going
when
the
count
said
i
am
sure
madame
has
prevailed
on
you
to
stay
and
to
come
to
my
ball
and
supper
she
has
led
me
to
anticipate
that
you
would
do
me
that
honour
and
she
promises
to
dance
the
quadrilles
with
me
how
can
one
resist
entreaty
from
such
lips
quite
so
and
i
am
obliged
to
her
for
having
kept
you
with
us
i
hope
to
see
you
i
went
out
of
the
box
in
love
and
almost
happy
in
anticipation
the
pomade
was
a
present
from
esther
and
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
used
it
the
box
contained
pots
of
beautiful
china
the
next
day
i
put
twelve
into
an
elegant
casket
which
i
wrapped
up
in
and
sent
to
her
without
a
note
i
spent
the
morning
by
going
over
cologne
with
a
guide
i
visited
all
the
marvels
of
the
place
and
laughed
with
all
my
heart
to
see
the
horse
bayard
of
whom
ariosto
has
sung
ridden
by
the
four
sons
of
aimon
or
amone
father
of
bradamante
the
invincible
and
ricciardetto
the
fortunate
i
dined
with
de
castries
and
everybody
was
surprised
that
the
general
had
asked
me
himself
to
the
ball
as
his
jealousy
was
known
while
the
lady
was
supposed
only
to
suffer
his
attentions
through
a
feeling
of
vanity
the
dear
general
was
well
advanced
in
years
far
from
and
as
his
mental
qualities
by
no
means
compensated
for
his
lack
of
physical
ones
he
was
by
no
means
an
object
to
inspire
love
in
spite
of
his
jealousy
he
had
to
appear
pleased
that
i
sat
next
the
fair
at
supper
and
that
i
spent
the
night
in
dancing
with
her
or
talking
to
her
it
was
a
happy
night
for
me
and
i
my
lodging
no
longer
thinking
of
leaving
cologne
in
a
moment
of
ecstasy
emboldened
by
the
turn
the
conversation
had
taken
i
had
dared
to
tell
her
that
if
she
would
meet
me
alone
i
would
stay
in
cologne
till
the
end
of
the
carnival
and
what
would
you
say
she
asked
if
i
give
my
promise
and
do
not
keep
it
i
should
bemoan
my
lot
without
accusing
you
i
should
say
to
myself
that
you
had
found
it
impossible
to
keep
your
word
you
are
very
good
you
must
stay
with
us
the
day
after
the
ball
i
went
to
pay
her
my
first
visit
she
made
me
welcome
and
introduced
me
to
her
worthy
husband
who
though
neither
young
nor
handsome
was
extremely
after
i
had
been
there
an
hour
we
heard
the
general
carriage
coming
and
she
said
to
me
if
he
asks
you
whether
you
are
going
to
the
elector
ball
at
bonn
say
yes
the
general
came
in
and
after
the
usual
compliments
had
been
passed
i
withdrew
i
did
not
know
by
whom
the
ball
was
to
be
given
or
when
it
was
to
take
place
but
scenting
pleasure
from
afar
off
i
hastened
to
make
enquiries
about
it
and
heard
that
all
the
good
families
in
cologne
were
going
it
was
a
masked
ball
and
consequently
open
to
all
i
decided
then
that
i
would
go
indeed
i
concluded
that
i
had
had
orders
to
that
effect
and
at
all
events
my
lady
would
be
there
and
i
might
hope
for
a
happy
meeting
with
her
but
as
i
wished
to
keep
up
my
incognito
as
much
as
possible
i
resolved
to
reply
to
all
who
asked
me
that
important
business
would
prevent
my
being
present
it
fell
out
that
the
general
asked
me
this
very
question
in
the
presence
of
the
lady
and
without
regard
to
the
orders
i
had
received
from
her
i
replied
that
my
health
would
forbid
my
having
that
pleasure
you
are
very
wise
sir
said
the
general
all
the
pleasures
on
earth
should
be
sacrificed
when
it
is
a
question
of
one
health
i
think
so
too
now
but
i
thought
differently
then
on
the
day
of
the
ball
towards
the
evening
i
set
out
in
a
disguised
so
that
not
a
soul
in
cologne
could
have
recognized
me
and
provided
with
a
box
containing
two
dominoes
and
on
my
arrival
at
bonn
i
took
a
room
and
put
on
one
of
the
dominoes
locking
up
the
other
in
the
box
and
i
then
had
myself
carried
to
the
ball
in
a
i
got
in
easily
and
unperceived
and
recognized
all
the
ladies
of
cologne
without
their
masks
and
my
mistress
sitting
at
a
risking
a
ducat
i
was
glad
to
see
in
the
banker
count
verita
of
verona
whom
i
had
known
in
bavaria
he
was
in
the
elector
service
his
small
bank
did
not
contain
more
than
five
or
six
ducats
and
the
punters
men
and
women
were
not
more
than
twelve
i
took
up
a
position
by
my
mistress
and
the
banker
asked
me
to
cut
i
excused
myself
with
a
gesture
and
my
neighbour
cut
without
being
asked
i
put
ten
ducats
on
a
single
card
and
lost
four
times
running
i
played
at
the
second
deal
and
experienced
the
same
fate
at
the
third
deal
nobody
would
cut
and
the
general
who
was
standing
by
but
not
playing
agreed
to
do
so
i
fancied
his
cutting
would
be
lucky
and
i
put
fifty
ducats
on
one
card
i
won
i
went
and
at
the
second
deal
i
broke
the
bank
everybody
was
curious
about
me
i
was
stared
at
and
followed
but
seizing
a
favourable
opportunity
i
made
my
escape
i
went
to
my
room
took
out
my
money
changed
my
costume
and
returned
to
the
ball
i
saw
the
table
occupied
by
new
gamesters
and
another
banker
who
seemed
to
have
a
good
deal
of
gold
but
not
caring
to
play
any
more
i
had
not
brought
much
money
with
me
i
mingled
in
all
the
groups
in
the
ballroom
and
on
all
sides
i
heard
expressions
of
curiosity
about
the
mask
who
broke
the
first
bank
i
did
not
care
to
satisfy
the
general
curiosity
but
made
my
way
from
one
side
of
the
room
to
the
other
till
i
found
the
object
of
my
search
talking
to
count
verita
and
as
i
drew
near
i
found
out
that
they
were
talking
of
me
the
count
was
saying
that
the
elector
had
been
asking
who
had
broken
the
bank
and
that
general
kettler
had
expressed
his
opinion
that
it
was
a
venetian
who
had
been
in
cologne
for
the
last
week
my
mistress
answered
that
she
did
not
think
i
was
there
as
she
had
heard
me
say
that
the
state
of
my
health
would
keep
me
at
home
i
know
casanova
said
the
count
and
if
he
be
at
bonn
the
elector
shall
hear
of
it
and
he
sha
go
off
without
my
seeing
him
i
saw
that
i
might
easily
be
discovered
after
the
ball
but
i
defied
the
keenest
eyes
to
penetrate
beneath
my
present
disguise
i
should
have
no
doubt
remained
unknown
but
when
the
quadrilles
were
being
arranged
i
took
my
place
in
one
without
reflecting
that
i
should
have
to
take
off
my
mask
as
soon
as
my
mistress
saw
me
she
told
me
she
had
been
deceived
as
she
would
have
wagered
that
i
was
the
masker
who
broke
count
verita
bank
i
told
her
i
had
only
just
come
at
the
end
of
the
dance
the
count
spied
me
out
and
said
my
dear
i
am
sure
you
are
the
man
who
broke
my
bank
i
congratulate
you
i
should
congratulate
myself
if
i
were
the
fortunate
individual
i
am
sure
that
it
was
you
i
left
him
laughing
and
after
having
taken
some
refreshments
i
continued
dancing
two
hours
afterwards
the
count
saw
me
again
and
said
you
changed
your
domino
in
such
a
room
in
such
a
house
the
elector
knows
all
about
it
and
as
a
punishment
for
this
deceit
he
has
ordered
me
to
tell
you
that
you
are
not
to
leave
bonn
is
he
going
to
arrest
me
then
why
not
if
you
refuse
his
invitation
to
dinner
tomorrow
tell
his
highness
that
his
commands
shall
be
obeyed
will
you
present
me
to
him
now
he
has
left
the
ball
but
wait
on
me
at
noon
so
saying
he
gave
me
his
hand
and
went
away
i
took
care
to
keep
the
appointment
on
the
day
following
but
when
i
was
presented
i
was
in
some
confusion
as
the
elector
was
surrounded
by
five
or
six
courtiers
and
never
having
seen
him
i
looked
in
vain
for
an
ecclesiastic
he
saw
my
embarrassment
and
hastened
to
put
an
end
to
it
saying
in
bad
venetian
i
am
wearing
the
costume
of
grand
master
of
the
teutonic
order
in
spite
of
his
costume
i
made
the
usual
genuflexion
and
when
i
would
have
kissed
his
hand
he
would
not
allow
it
but
shook
mine
in
an
affectionate
manner
i
was
at
venice
said
he
when
you
were
under
the
leads
and
my
nephew
the
elector
of
bavaria
told
me
that
after
your
fortunate
escape
you
stayed
some
time
at
munich
if
you
had
come
to
cologne
i
should
have
kept
you
i
hope
that
after
dinner
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
tell
us
the
story
of
your
escape
that
you
will
stay
to
supper
and
will
join
in
a
little
masquerade
with
which
we
propose
to
amuse
ourselves
i
promised
to
tell
my
tale
if
he
thought
it
would
not
weary
him
warning
him
that
it
would
take
two
hours
one
could
never
have
too
much
of
a
good
thing
he
was
kind
enough
to
say
and
i
made
him
laugh
by
my
account
of
the
conversation
between
the
duc
de
choiseul
and
myself
at
dinner
the
prince
spoke
to
me
in
venetian
and
was
pleased
to
be
most
gracious
towards
me
he
was
a
man
of
a
jovial
and
disposition
and
with
his
look
of
health
one
would
not
have
prophesied
so
soon
an
end
as
came
to
him
he
died
the
year
following
as
soon
as
we
rose
from
table
he
begged
me
to
begin
my
story
and
for
two
hours
i
had
the
pleasure
of
keeping
this
most
brilliant
company
amused
my
readers
know
the
history
its
interest
lies
in
the
dramatic
nature
of
the
details
but
it
is
impossible
to
communicate
the
fire
of
a
story
to
an
account
in
writing
the
elector
little
bail
was
very
pleasant
we
were
all
dressed
as
peasants
and
the
costumes
were
taken
from
a
special
wardrobe
of
the
prince
it
would
have
been
ridiculous
to
choose
any
other
dresses
as
the
elector
wore
one
of
the
same
kind
himself
general
kettler
was
the
best
disguised
of
us
all
he
looked
the
rustic
to
the
life
my
mistress
was
ravishing
we
only
danced
quadrilles
and
german
dances
there
were
only
four
or
five
ladies
of
the
highest
rank
all
the
others
who
were
more
or
less
pretty
were
favourites
of
the
prince
all
his
days
a
great
lover
of
the
fair
sex
two
of
these
ladies
danced
the
forlana
and
the
elector
was
much
amused
in
making
me
dance
it
also
i
have
already
said
that
the
forlana
is
a
venetian
dance
and
one
of
the
most
energetic
kind
imaginable
it
is
danced
by
a
lady
and
gentleman
opposite
to
one
another
and
as
the
two
ladies
relieved
one
another
they
were
almost
the
death
of
me
one
has
to
be
strong
to
dance
twelve
turns
and
after
the
thirteenth
i
felt
i
could
do
no
more
and
begged
for
mercy
soon
after
we
danced
another
dance
where
each
gentleman
kisses
a
lady
i
was
not
too
shy
and
each
time
i
continued
to
kiss
my
mistress
with
considerable
ardour
which
made
the
burst
with
laughter
and
the
burst
with
rage
in
a
lull
between
the
dances
this
charming
and
original
woman
found
means
to
tell
me
in
private
that
all
the
cologne
ladies
would
leave
at
noon
on
the
next
day
and
that
i
would
increase
my
popularity
by
inviting
them
all
to
breakfast
at
bruhl
send
each
one
a
note
with
the
name
of
her
cavalier
and
trust
in
count
verita
to
do
everything
for
the
best
you
need
only
tell
him
that
you
wish
to
give
an
entertainment
similar
to
that
given
two
years
ago
by
the
prince
de
lose
no
time
you
will
have
a
score
of
guests
mind
you
let
them
know
the
hour
of
the
repast
take
care
too
that
your
invitations
are
sent
round
by
nine
in
the
morning
all
these
instructions
were
uttered
with
lightning
speed
and
i
enchanted
with
the
power
my
mistress
thought
she
possessed
over
me
thought
only
of
obeying
without
reflecting
whether
i
owed
her
obedience
bruhl

the
prince
invitations
to
the
ladies
count
verita
i
knew
as
much
as
she
could
have
told
me
if
she
had
taken
an
hour
i
left
the
room
in
my
peasant
dress
and
begged
a
page
to
take
me
to
count
verita
who
began
to
laugh
on
seeing
my
attire
i
told
my
business
with
the
importance
of
an
ambassador
and
this
made
him
in
a
still
better
humour
it
can
all
easily
be
arranged
said
he
i
have
only
to
write
to
the
steward
and
i
will
do
so
immediately
but
how
much
do
you
want
to
spend
as
much
as
possible
as
little
as
possible
i
suppose
you
mean
not
at
all
i
want
to
treat
my
guests
with
magnificence
all
the
same
you
must
fix
on
a
sum
as
i
know
whom
i
got
to
deal
with
well
well
hundred
ducats
will
that
do
two
hundred
the
prince
de
did
not
spend
more
he
began
to
write
and
gave
me
his
word
that
everything
should
be
in
readiness
i
left
him
and
addressing
myself
to
a
sharp
italian
page
said
that
i
would
give
two
ducats
to
the
valet
who
would
furnish
me
with
the
names
of
the
cologne
ladies
who
were
in
bonn
and
of
the
gentlemen
who
had
accompanied
them
i
got
what
i
wanted
in
less
than
half
an
hour
and
before
leaving
the
ball
i
told
my
mistress
that
all
should
be
done
according
to
her
desires
i
wrote
eighteen
notes
before
i
went
to
bed
and
in
the
morning
a
confidential
servant
had
delivered
them
before
nine
at
nine
i
went
to
take
leave
of
count
verita
who
gave
me
on
behalf
of
the
elector
a
superb
gold
with
his
portrait
set
in
diamonds
i
was
very
sensible
of
this
mark
of
kindness
and
i
wished
to
go
and
thank
his
serene
highness
before
my
departure
but
my
friendly
told
me
that
i
might
put
off
doing
so
till
i
passed
through
bonn
on
my
way
to
frankfort
breakfast
was
ordered
for
one
at
noon
i
had
arrived
at
bruhl
a
country
house
of
the
elector
with
nothing
remarkable
about
it
save
its
furniture
in
this
it
is
a
poor
copy
of
the
trianon
in
a
fine
hall
i
found
a
table
laid
for
persons
arranged
with
silver
gilt
plates
damask
linen
and
exquisite
china
while
the
sideboard
was
adorned
with
an
immense
quantity
of
silver
and
silvergilt
plate
at
one
end
of
the
room
were
two
other
tables
laden
with
sweets
and
the
choicest
wines
procurable
i
announced
myself
as
the
host
and
the
cook
told
me
i
should
be
perfectly
satisfied
the
collation
said
he
will
be
composed
of
only
dishes
but
in
addition
there
will
be
dishes
of
english
oysters
and
a
splendid
dessert
i
saw
a
great
number
of
servants
and
told
him
that
they
would
not
be
necessary
but
he
said
they
were
as
the
guests
servants
could
not
be
admitted
i
received
all
my
guests
at
the
door
confining
my
compliments
to
begging
their
pardons
for
having
been
so
bold
as
to
procure
myself
this
great
honour
the
breakfast
was
served
at
one
exactly
and
i
had
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
the
astonishment
in
my
mistress
eyes
when
she
saw
that
i
had
treated
them
as
well
as
a
prince
of
the
empire
she
was
aware
that
everybody
knew
her
to
be
the
chief
object
of
this
lavish
outlay
but
she
was
delighted
to
see
that
i
did
not
pay
her
any
attentions
which
were
at
all
invidious
the
table
was
seated
for
and
though
i
had
only
asked
eighteen
people
every
place
was
occupied
three
couples
therefore
had
come
without
being
asked
but
that
pleased
me
all
the
more
like
a
courtly
cavalier
i
would
not
sit
down
but
waited
on
the
ladies
going
from
one
to
the
other
eating
the
dainty
bits
they
gave
me
and
seeing
that
all
had
what
they
wanted
by
the
time
the
oysters
were
done
twenty
bottles
of
champagne
had
been
emptied
so
that
when
the
actual
breakfast
commenced
everybody
began
to
talk
at
once
the
meal
might
easily
have
passed
for
a
splendid
dinner
and
i
was
glad
to
see
that
not
a
drop
of
water
was
drunk
for
the
champagne
tokay
rhine
wine
madeira
malaga
cyprus
alicante
and
cape
wine
would
not
allow
it
before
dessert
was
brought
on
an
enormous
dish
of
truffles
was
placed
on
the
table
i
advised
my
guests
to
take
maraschino
with
it
and
those
ladies
who
appreciated
the
liqueur
drank
it
as
if
it
had
been
water
the
dessert
was
really
sumptuous
in
it
were
displayed
the
portraits
of
all
the
monarchs
of
europe
everyone
complimented
the
cook
on
his
achievement
and
he
his
vanity
being
tickled
and
wishing
to
appear
said
that
none
of
it
would
spoil
in
the
pocket
and
accordingly
everybody
took
as
much
as
they
chose
general
kettler
who
in
spite
of
his
jealousy
and
the
part
he
saw
me
play
had
no
suspicion
of
the
real
origin
of
the
banquet
said
i
will
wager
that
this
is
the
elector
doing
his
highness
has
desired
to
preserve
his
incognito
and
casanova
has
played
his
part
to
admiration
this
remark
set
all
the
company
in
a
roar
general
said
i
if
the
elector
had
given
me
such
an
order
i
should
of
course
have
obeyed
him
but
i
should
have
felt
it
a
humiliating
part
to
play
his
highness
however
has
deigned
to
do
me
a
far
greater
honour
look
here
so
saying
i
shewed
him
the
gold
which
made
the
tour
of
the
table
two
or
three
times
over
when
we
had
finished
we
rose
from
table
astonished
to
find
we
had
been
engaged
for
three
hours
in
a
pleasurable
occupation
which
all
would
willingly
have
prolonged
but
at
last
we
had
to
part
and
after
many
compliments
they
all
went
upon
their
way
in
order
to
be
in
time
for
the
theatre
as
well
pleased
as
my
guests
i
left
twenty
ducats
with
the
steward
for
the
servants
and
promised
him
to
let
count
verita
know
of
my
satisfaction
in
writing
i
arrived
at
cologne
in
time
for
the
french
play
and
as
i
had
no
carriage
i
went
to
the
theatre
in
a
sedan
chair
as
soon
as
i
got
into
the
house
i
saw
the
comte
de
lastic
alone
with
my
fair
one
i
thought
this
a
good
omen
and
i
went
to
them
directly
as
soon
as
she
saw
me
she
said
with
a
melancholy
air
that
the
general
had
got
so
ill
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
go
to
bed
soon
after
de
lastic
left
us
and
dropping
her
assumed
melancholy
she
made
me
with
the
utmost
grace
a
thousand
compliments
which
compensated
me
for
the
expenses
of
my
breakfast
a
hundred
times
over
the
general
said
she
had
too
much
to
drink
he
is
an
envious
devil
and
has
discovered
that
it
is
not
seemly
of
you
to
treat
us
as
if
you
were
a
prince
i
told
him
that
on
the
contrary
you
had
treated
us
as
if
we
were
princes
waiting
on
us
with
your
napkin
on
your
arm
he
thereupon
found
fault
with
me
for
degrading
you
why
do
you
not
send
him
about
his
business
so
rude
a
fellow
is
not
worthy
of
serving
so
famous
a
beauty
it
too
late
a
woman
whom
you
do
know
would
get
possession
of
him
i
should
be
obliged
to
conceal
my
feelings
and
that
would
vex
me
i
understand
i
understand
would
that
i
were
a
great
prince
in
the
mean
time
let
me
tell
you
that
my
sickness
is
greater
than
kettler
you
are
joking
i
hope
nay
not
at
all
i
am
speaking
seriously
for
the
kisses
i
was
so
happy
to
snatch
from
you
at
the
ball
have
inflamed
my
blood
and
if
you
have
not
enough
kindness
to
cure
me
in
the
only
possible
way
i
shall
leave
cologne
with
a
grief
put
off
your
departure
why
should
you
desire
to
go
to
stuttgart
so
earnestly
i
think
of
you
believe
me
and
i
do
not
wish
to
deceive
you
but
it
is
hard
to
find
an
opportunity
if
you
had
not
the
general
carriage
waiting
for
you
and
i
had
mine
i
could
take
you
home
with
perfect
propriety
hush
as
you
have
not
your
carriage
it
is
my
part
to
take
you
home
it
is
a
splendid
idea
that
we
must
so
contrive
it
that
it
may
not
seem
to
be
a
concerted
plan
you
must
give
me
your
arm
to
my
carriage
and
i
shall
then
ask
you
where
your
carriage
is
you
will
answer
that
you
have
not
got
one
i
shall
ask
you
to
come
into
mine
and
i
will
drop
you
at
your
hotel
it
will
only
give
us
a
couple
of
minutes
but
that
is
something
till
we
are
more
fortunate
i
replied
to
her
only
by
a
look
which
expressed
the
intoxication
of
my
spirits
at
the
prospect
of
so
great
bliss
although
the
play
was
quite
a
short
one
it
seemed
to
me
to
last
for
ever
at
last
the
curtain
fell
and
we
went
downstairs
when
we
got
to
the
portico
she
asked
me
the
questions
we
had
agreed
upon
and
when
i
told
her
i
had
not
got
a
carriage
she
said
i
am
going
to
the
to
ask
after
his
health
if
it
will
not
take
you
too
much
out
of
your
way
i
can
leave
you
at
your
lodging
as
we
come
back
it
was
a
grand
idea
we
should
pass
the
entire
length
of
the
town
twice
and
thus
we
secured
a
little
more
time
unfortunately
the
carriage
was
a
chariot
and
as
we
were
going
the
moon
shone
directly
on
us
on
that
occasion
the
planet
was
certainly
not
entitled
to
the
appellation
of
the
lovers
friend
we
did
all
we
could
but
that
was
almost
nothing
and
i
found
the
attempt
a
desperate
one
though
my
lovely
partner
endeavoured
to
help
me
as
much
as
possible
to
add
to
our
discomforts
the
inquisitive
and
impudent
coachman
kept
turning
his
head
round
which
forced
us
to
moderate
the
energy
of
our
movements
the
sentry
at
the
general
door
told
our
coachman
that
his
excellency
could
see
no
one
and
we
joyfully
turned
towards
my
hotel
and
now
that
the
moon
was
behind
us
and
the
man
curiosity
less
inconvenient
we
got
on
a
little
better
or
rather
not
so
badly
as
before
but
the
horses
seemed
to
me
to
fly
rather
than
gallop
however
feeling
that
it
would
be
well
to
have
the
coachman
on
my
side
in
case
of
another
opportunity
i
gave
him
a
ducat
as
i
got
down
i
entered
the
hotel
feeling
vexed
and
unhappy
though
more
in
love
than
ever
for
my
fair
one
had
convinced
me
that
she
was
no
passive
mistress
but
could
experience
pleasure
as
well
as
give
it
that
being
the
case
i
resolved
not
to
leave
cologne
before
we
had
drained
the
cup
of
pleasure
together
and
that
it
seemed
to
me
could
not
take
place
till
the
general
was
out
of
the
way
next
day
at
noon
i
went
to
the
general
house
to
write
down
my
name
but
i
found
he
was
receiving
visitors
and
i
went
in
i
made
the
general
an
appropriate
compliment
to
which
the
rude
austrian
only
replied
by
a
cold
inclination
of
the
head
he
was
surrounded
by
a
good
many
officers
and
after
four
minutes
i
made
a
general
bow
and
went
out
the
boor
kept
his
room
for
three
days
and
as
my
mistress
did
not
come
to
the
theatre
i
had
not
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
on
the
last
day
of
the
carnival
kettler
asked
a
good
many
people
to
a
ball
and
supper
on
my
going
to
pay
my
court
to
my
mistress
in
her
box
at
the
theatre
and
being
left
for
a
moment
alone
with
her
she
asked
me
if
i
were
invited
to
the
general
supper
i
answered
in
the
negative
what
said
she
in
an
imperious
and
indignant
voice
he
has
not
asked
you
you
must
go
for
all
that
consider
what
you
say
said
i
gently
i
will
do
anything
to
please
you
but
that
i
know
all
you
can
urge
nevertheless
you
must
go
i
should
feel
insulted
if
you
were
not
at
that
supper
if
you
love
me
you
will
give
me
this
proof
of
your
affection
and
i
think
i
may
say
esteem
you
ask
me
thus
then
i
will
go
but
are
you
aware
that
you
are
exposing
me
to
the
danger
of
losing
my
life
or
taking
his
for
i
am
not
the
man
to
pass
over
an
affront
i
know
all
you
can
say
said
she
i
have
your
honour
at
heart
as
much
as
mine
or
perhaps
more
so
but
nothing
will
happen
to
you
i
will
answer
for
everything
you
must
go
and
you
must
give
me
your
promise
now
for
i
am
resolved
if
you
do
not
go
neither
will
i
but
we
must
never
see
each
other
more
then
you
may
reckon
upon
me
at
that
moment
de
castries
came
in
and
i
left
the
box
and
went
to
the
pit
where
i
passed
two
anxious
hours
in
reflecting
on
the
possible
consequences
of
the
strange
step
this
woman
would
have
me
take
nevertheless
such
was
the
sway
of
her
beauty
aver
my
soul
i
determined
to
abide
by
my
promise
and
to
carry
the
matter
through
and
to
put
myself
in
the
wrong
as
little
as
possible
i
went
to
the
general
at
the
end
of
the
play
and
only
found
five
or
six
people
there
i
went
up
to
a
canoness
who
was
very
fond
of
italian
poetry
and
had
no
trouble
in
engaging
her
in
an
interesting
discussion
in
half
an
hour
the
room
was
full
my
mistress
coming
in
last
on
the
general
arm
i
was
taken
up
with
the
canoness
and
did
not
stir
and
consequently
kettler
did
not
notice
me
while
the
lady
in
great
delight
at
seeing
me
left
him
no
time
to
examine
his
guests
and
he
was
soon
talking
to
some
people
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
supper
was
announced
the
canoness
rose
took
my
arm
and
we
seated
ourselves
at
table
together
still
talking
about
italian
literature
then
came
the
catastrophe
when
all
the
places
had
been
taken
one
gentleman
was
left
standing
there
being
no
place
for
him
how
can
that
have
happened
said
the
general
raising
his
voice
and
while
the
servants
were
bringing
another
chair
and
arranging
another
place
he
passed
his
guests
in
review
all
the
while
i
pretended
not
to
notice
what
was
going
on
but
when
he
came
to
me
he
said
loudly
sir
i
did
not
ask
you
to
come
that
is
quite
true
general
i
said
respectfully
but
i
thought
no
doubt
correctly
that
the
omission
was
due
to
forgetfulness
and
i
thought
myself
obliged
all
the
same
to
come
and
pay
my
court
to
your
excellency
without
a
pause
i
renewed
my
conversation
with
the
canoness
not
so
much
as
looking
around
a
dreadful
silence
reigned
for
four
or
five
minutes
but
the
canoness
began
to
utter
witticisms
which
i
took
up
and
communicated
to
my
neighbours
so
that
in
a
short
time
the
whole
table
was
in
good
spirits
except
the
general
who
preserved
a
sulky
silence
this
did
not
much
matter
to
me
but
my
vanity
was
concerned
in
smoothing
him
down
and
i
watched
for
my
opportunity
de
castries
was
praising
the
dauphin
and
his
brothers
the
comte
de
lusace
and
the
duc
de
courlande
were
mentioned
this
led
the
conversation
up
to
prince
biron
formerly
a
duke
who
was
in
siberia
and
his
personal
qualities
were
discussed
one
of
the
guests
having
said
that
his
chiefest
merit
was
to
have
pleased
the
empress
anne
i
begged
his
pardon
saying
his
greatest
merit
was
to
have
served
faithfully
the
last
duke
kettler
who
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
courage
of
him
who
is
now
so
unfortunate
would
have
lost
all
his
belongings
in
the
war
it
was
duke
kettler
who
so
heroically
sent
him
to
the
court
of
petersburg
but
biron
never
asked
for
the
duchy
an
earldom
would
have
satisfied
him
as
he
recognized
the
rights
of
the
younger
branch
of
the
kettler
family
which
would
be
reigning
now
if
it
were
not
for
the
empress
whim
nothing
would
satisfy
her
but
to
confer
a
dukedom
on
the
favourite
the
general
whose
face
had
cleared
while
i
was
speaking
said
in
the
most
polite
manner
of
which
he
was
capable
that
i
was
a
person
of
remarkable
information
adding
regretfully
yes
if
it
were
not
for
that
whim
i
should
be
reigning
now
after
this
modest
remark
he
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
and
sent
me
down
a
bottle
of
the
best
rhine
wine
and
addressed
his
conversation
to
me
till
the
supper
was
over
i
quietly
enjoyed
the
turn
things
had
taken
but
still
more
the
pleasure
i
saw
expressed
in
the
beautiful
eyes
of
my
mistress
dancing
went
on
all
night
and
i
did
not
leave
my
canoness
who
was
a
delightful
woman
and
danced
admirably
with
my
lady
i
only
danced
one
minuet
towards
the
end
of
the
ball
the
general
to
finish
up
with
a
piece
of
awkwardness
asked
me
if
i
was
going
soon
i
replied
that
i
did
not
think
of
leaving
cologne
till
after
the
grand
review
i
went
to
bed
full
of
joy
at
having
given
the
burgomaster
wife
such
a
signal
proof
of
my
love
and
full
of
gratitude
to
fortune
who
had
helped
me
so
in
dealing
with
my
doltish
general
for
god
knows
what
i
should
have
done
if
he
had
forgotten
himself
so
far
as
to
tell
me
to
leave
the
table
the
next
time
i
saw
the
fair
she
told
me
she
had
felt
a
mortal
pang
of
fear
shoot
through
her
when
the
general
said
he
had
not
asked
me
i
am
quite
sure
said
she
that
he
would
have
gone
further
if
your
grand
answer
had
not
stopped
his
mouth
but
if
he
had
said
another
word
my
mind
was
made
up
to
do
what
i
should
have
risen
from
the
table
and
taken
your
arm
and
we
should
have
gone
out
together
de
castries
has
told
me
that
he
would
have
done
the
same
and
i
believe
all
the
ladies
whom
you
asked
to
breakfast
would
have
followed
our
example
but
the
affair
would
not
have
stopped
then
for
i
should
certainly
have
demanded
immediate
satisfaction
and
if
he
had
refused
it
i
should
have
struck
him
with
the
flat
of
my
sword
i
know
that
but
pray
forget
that
it
was
i
who
exposed
you
to
this
danger
for
my
part
i
shall
never
forget
what
i
owe
to
you
and
i
will
try
to
convince
you
of
my
gratitude
two
days
later
on
hearing
that
she
was
indisposed
i
went
to
call
on
her
at
eleven
at
which
time
i
was
sure
the
general
would
not
be
there
she
received
me
in
her
husband
room
and
he
in
the
friendliest
manner
possible
asked
me
if
i
had
come
to
dine
with
them
i
hastened
to
thank
him
for
his
invitation
which
i
accepted
with
pleasure
and
i
enjoyed
this
dinner
better
than
kettler
supper
the
burgomaster
was
a
man
and
intelligent
and
a
lover
of
peace
and
quietness
his
wife
whom
he
adored
ought
to
have
loved
him
since
he
was
by
no
means
one
of
those
husbands
whose
motto
is
displease
whom
you
like
so
long
as
you
please
me
on
her
husband
going
out
for
a
short
time
she
shewed
me
over
the
house
here
is
our
bedroom
said
she
and
this
is
the
closet
in
which
i
sleep
for
five
or
six
nights
in
every
month
here
is
a
church
which
we
may
look
upon
as
our
private
chapel
as
we
hear
mass
from
those
two
grated
windows
on
sundays
we
go
down
this
stair
and
enter
the
church
by
a
door
the
key
to
which
is
always
in
my
keeping
it
was
the
second
saturday
in
lent
we
had
an
excellent
fasting
dinner
but
i
did
not
for
once
pay
much
attention
to
eating
to
see
this
young
and
beautiful
woman
surrounded
by
her
children
adored
by
her
family
seemed
to
me
a
beautiful
sight
i
left
them
at
an
early
hour
to
write
to
esther
whom
i
did
not
neglect
all
occupied
as
i
was
with
this
new
flame
next
day
i
went
to
hear
mass
at
the
little
church
next
to
the
burgomaster
house
i
was
well
cloaked
so
as
not
to
attract
attention
i
saw
my
fair
one
going
out
wearing
a
capuchin
and
followed
by
her
family
i
noted
the
little
door
which
was
so
recessed
in
the
wall
that
it
would
have
escaped
the
notice
of
anyone
who
was
unaware
of
its
existence
it
opened
i
saw
towards
the
staircase
the
devil
who
as
everybody
knows
has
more
power
in
a
church
than
anywhere
else
put
into
my
head
the
idea
of
enjoying
my
mistress
by
means
of
the
door
and
stair
i
told
her
my
plan
the
next
day
at
the
theatre
i
have
thought
of
it
as
well
as
you
said
she
laughing
and
i
will
give
you
the
necessary
instructions
in
writing
you
will
find
them
in
the
first
gazette
i
send
you
we
could
not
continue
this
pleasant
interview
as
my
mistress
had
with
her
a
lady
from
who
was
staying
with
her
for
a
few
days
and
indeed
the
box
was
full
of
company
i
had
not
long
to
wait
for
next
day
she
gave
me
back
the
gazette
openly
telling
me
that
she
had
not
found
anything
to
interest
her
in
it
i
knew
that
it
would
be
exceedingly
interesting
to
me
her
note
was
as
follows
the
design
which
love
inspired
is
subject
not
to
difficulty
but
uncertainty
the
wife
only
sleeps
in
the
closet
when
her
husband
asks
her
an
event
which
only
occurs
at
certain
periods
and
the
separation
does
not
last
for
more
than
a
few
days
this
period
is
not
far
off
but
long
custom
has
made
it
impossible
for
the
wife
to
impose
on
her
husband
it
will
therefore
be
necessary
to
wait
love
will
warn
you
when
the
hour
of
bliss
has
come
the
plan
will
be
to
hide
in
the
church
and
there
must
be
no
thought
of
seducing
the
for
though
poor
he
is
too
stupid
to
be
bribed
and
would
betray
the
secret
the
only
way
will
be
to
hide
so
as
to
elude
his
watchfulness
he
shuts
the
church
at
noon
on
working
days
on
feast
days
he
shuts
it
at
evening
and
he
always
opens
it
again
at
dawn
when
the
time
comes
all
that
need
be
done
is
to
give
the
door
a
gentle
will
not
be
locked
as
the
closet
which
is
to
be
the
scene
of
the
blissful
combat
is
only
separated
from
the
room
by
a
partition
there
must
be
no
spitting
coughing
nor
it
would
be
fatal
the
escape
will
be
a
matter
of
no
difficulty
one
can
go
down
to
the
church
and
go
out
as
soon
as
it
is
opened
since
the
beadle
has
seen
nobody
in
the
evening
it
is
not
likely
that
he
will
see
more
in
the
morning
i
kissed
again
and
again
this
charming
letter
which
i
thought
shewed
great
power
of
mental
combination
and
i
went
next
day
to
see
how
the
coast
lay
this
was
the
first
thing
to
be
done
there
was
a
chair
in
the
church
in
which
i
should
never
have
been
seen
but
the
stair
was
on
the
sacristy
side
and
that
was
always
locked
up
i
decided
on
occupying
the
confessional
which
was
close
to
the
door
i
could
creep
into
the
space
beneath
the
confessor
seat
but
it
was
so
small
that
i
doubted
my
ability
to
stay
there
after
the
door
was
shut
i
waited
till
noon
to
make
the
attempt
and
as
soon
as
the
church
was
empty
i
took
up
my
position
i
had
to
roll
myself
up
into
a
ball
and
even
then
i
was
so
badly
concealed
by
the
folding
door
that
anyone
happening
to
pass
by
at
two
paces
distance
might
easily
have
seen
me
however
i
did
not
care
for
that
for
in
adventures
of
that
nature
one
must
leave
a
great
deal
to
fortune
determined
to
run
all
risks
i
went
home
highly
pleased
with
my
observations
i
put
everything
i
had
determined
down
in
writing
and
sent
it
to
her
box
at
the
theatre
enclosed
in
an
old
gazette
a
week
after
she
asked
the
general
in
my
presence
if
her
husband
could
do
anything
for
him
at
where
he
was
going
on
the
morrow
with
the
intention
of
returning
in
three
days
that
was
enough
for
me
but
a
glance
from
her
added
meaning
to
her
words
i
was
all
the
more
glad
as
i
had
a
slight
cold
and
the
next
day
being
a
feast
day
i
could
take
up
my
position
at
night
fall
and
thus
avoid
a
painful
vigil
of
several
hours
duration
i
curled
myself
up
in
the
confessional
at
four
hiding
myself
as
best
i
could
and
commending
myself
to
the
care
of
all
the
saints
at
five
the
beadle
made
his
usual
tour
of
inspection
went
out
and
locked
the
door
as
soon
as
i
heard
the
noise
of
the
key
i
came
out
of
my
narrow
cell
and
sat
down
on
a
bench
facing
the
windows
soon
after
my
mistress
shadow
appeared
on
the
grated
panes
and
i
knew
she
had
seen
me
i
sat
on
the
bench
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
then
pushed
open
the
little
door
and
entered
i
shut
it
and
sat
down
on
the
lowest
step
of
the
stair
and
spent
there
five
hours
which
would
probably
have
not
been
unpleasant
ones
if
i
had
not
been
dreadfully
tormented
by
the
rats
running
to
and
fro
close
to
me
nature
has
given
me
a
great
dislike
to
this
animal
which
is
comparatively
harmless
but
the
smell
of
rats
always
sickens
me
at
last
i
heard
the
clock
strike
ten
the
hour
of
bliss
and
i
saw
the
form
of
my
beloved
holding
a
candle
and
i
was
then
freed
from
my
painful
position
if
my
readers
have
been
in
such
a
situation
they
can
imagine
the
pleasures
of
that
happy
night
but
they
can
not
divine
the
minute
circumstances
for
if
i
was
an
expert
my
partner
had
an
inexhaustible
store
of
contrivances
for
augmenting
the
bliss
of
that
sweet
employment
she
had
taken
care
to
get
me
a
little
collation
which
looked
delicious
but
which
i
could
not
touch
my
appetite
lying
in
another
quarter
for
seven
hours
which
i
thought
all
too
short
we
enjoyed
one
another
not
resting
except
for
talk
which
served
to
heighten
our
pleasure
the
burgomaster
was
not
the
man
for
an
ardent
passion
but
his
strength
of
constitution
enabled
him
to
do
his
duty
to
his
wife
every
night
without
failing
but
whether
from
regard
to
his
health
or
from
a
religious
scruple
he
suspended
his
rights
every
month
while
the
moon
exercised
hers
and
to
put
himself
out
of
temptation
he
made
his
wife
sleep
apart
but
for
once
in
a
way
the
lady
was
not
in
the
position
of
a
divorcee
exhausted
but
not
satiated
with
pleasure
i
left
her
at
assuring
her
that
when
we
met
again
she
would
find
me
the
same
and
with
that
i
went
to
hide
in
the
confessional
fearing
lest
the
growing
light
might
betray
me
to
the
beadle
however
i
got
away
without
any
difficulty
and
passed
nearly
the
whole
day
in
bed
having
my
dinner
served
to
me
in
my
room
in
the
evening
i
went
to
the
theatre
to
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
beloved
object
of
whom
my
love
and
constancy
had
made
me
the
possessor
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
she
sent
me
a
note
in
which
she
told
me
that
she
would
sleep
by
herself
on
the
night
following
it
was
a
ferial
day
and
i
therefore
went
to
the
church
at
eleven
in
the
morning
after
making
an
enormous
breakfast
i
hid
myself
as
before
and
the
beadle
locked
me
in
without
making
any
discovery
i
had
a
wait
of
ten
hours
and
the
reflection
that
i
should
have
to
spend
the
time
partly
in
the
church
and
partly
on
the
dark
and
staircase
without
being
able
to
take
a
pinch
of
snuff
for
fear
of
being
obliged
to
blow
my
nose
did
not
tend
to
enliven
the
prospect
however
the
hope
of
the
great
reward
made
it
easy
to
be
borne
but
at
one
i
heard
a
slight
noise
and
looking
up
saw
a
hand
appear
through
the
grated
window
and
a
paper
drop
on
the
floor
of
the
church
i
ran
to
pick
it
up
while
my
heart
beat
fast
for
my
first
idea
was
that
some
obstacle
had
occurred
which
would
compel
me
to
pass
the
night
on
a
bench
in
the
church
i
opened
it
and
what
was
my
joy
to
read
as
follows
the
door
is
open
and
you
will
be
more
comfortable
on
the
staircase
where
you
will
find
a
light
a
little
dinner
and
some
books
than
in
the
church
the
seat
is
not
very
easy
but
i
have
done
my
best
to
remedy
the
discomfort
with
a
cushion
trust
me
the
time
will
seem
as
long
to
me
as
to
you
but
be
patient
i
have
told
the
general
that
i
do
not
feel
very
well
and
shall
not
go
out
may
god
keep
you
from
coughing
especially
during
the
night
for
on
the
least
noise
we
should
be
undone
what
stratagems
are
inspired
by
love
i
opened
the
door
directly
and
found
a
meal
dainty
viands
delicious
wine
coffee
a
chafing
dish
lemons
spirits
of
wine
sugar
and
rum
to
make
some
punch
if
i
liked
with
these
comforts
and
some
books
i
could
wait
well
enough
but
i
was
astonished
at
the
dexterity
of
my
charming
mistress
in
doing
all
this
without
the
knowledge
of
anybody
in
the
house
i
spent
three
hours
in
reading
and
three
more
in
eating
and
making
coffee
and
punch
and
then
i
went
to
sleep
at
ten
my
darling
came
and
awoke
me
this
second
night
was
delicious
but
not
so
much
so
as
the
former
as
we
could
not
see
each
other
and
the
violence
of
our
ecstatic
combats
was
restrained
by
the
vicinity
of
the
good
husband
we
slept
part
of
the
time
and
early
in
the
morning
i
had
to
make
good
my
retreat
thus
ended
my
amour
with
this
lady
the
general
went
to
westphalia
and
she
was
soon
to
go
into
the
country
i
thus
made
my
preparations
for
leaving
cologne
promising
to
come
and
see
her
the
year
following
which
promise
however
i
was
precluded
as
the
reader
will
see
from
keeping
i
took
leave
of
my
acquaintance
and
set
out
regretted
by
all
the
stay
of
two
months
and
a
half
which
i
made
in
cologne
did
not
diminish
my
monetary
resources
although
i
lost
whenever
i
was
persuaded
to
play
however
my
winnings
at
bonn
made
up
all
deficiencies
and
my
banker
franck
complained
that
i
had
not
made
any
use
of
him
however
i
was
obliged
to
be
prudent
so
that
those
persons
who
spied
into
my
actions
might
find
nothing
reprehensible
i
left
cologne
about
the
middle
of
march
and
i
stopped
at
bonn
to
present
my
respects
to
the
elector
but
he
was
away
i
dined
with
count
verita
and
the
abbe
scampar
a
favourite
of
the
elector
after
dinner
the
count
gave
me
a
letter
of
introduction
to
a
canoness
at
coblentz
of
whom
he
spoke
in
very
high
terms
that
obliged
me
to
stop
at
coblentz
but
when
i
got
down
at
the
inn
i
found
that
the
canoness
was
at
manheim
while
in
her
stead
i
encountered
an
actress
named
toscani
who
was
going
to
stuttgart
with
her
young
and
pretty
daughter
she
was
on
her
way
from
paris
where
her
daughter
had
been
learning
with
the
famous
vestris
i
had
known
her
at
paris
but
had
not
seen
much
of
her
though
i
had
given
her
a
little
spaniel
dog
which
was
the
joy
of
her
daughter
this
daughter
was
a
perfect
jewel
who
had
very
little
difficulty
in
persuading
me
to
come
with
them
to
stuttgart
where
i
expected
for
other
reasons
to
have
a
very
pleasant
stay
the
mother
was
impatient
to
know
what
the
duke
would
think
of
her
daughter
for
she
had
destined
her
from
her
childhood
to
serve
the
pleasures
of
this
voluptuous
prince
who
though
he
had
a
titular
mistress
was
fond
of
experimenting
with
all
the
who
took
his
fancy
we
made
up
a
little
and
it
may
be
guessed
that
two
of
us
belonging
to
the
boards
the
conversation
was
not
exactly
a
course
in
moral
theology
the
toscani
told
me
that
her
daughter
was
a
neophyte
and
that
she
had
made
up
her
mind
not
to
let
the
duke
touch
her
till
he
had
dismissed
his
reigning
mistress
whose
place
she
was
designed
to
take
the
mistress
in
question
was
a
dancer
named
gardella
daughter
of
a
venetian
boatman
whose
name
has
been
mentioned
in
my
first
volume
in
fine
she
was
the
wife
of
michel
whom
i
found
at
munich
fleeing
from
the
terrible
leads
where
i
myself
languished
for
so
long
as
i
seemed
to
doubt
the
mother
assertion
and
threw
out
some
rather
broad
hints
to
the
effect
that
i
believed
that
the
first
bloom
had
been
plucked
at
paris
and
that
the
duke
of
wurtemburg
would
only
have
the
second
their
vanity
was
touched
and
on
my
proposing
to
verify
the
matter
with
my
own
eyes
it
was
solemnly
agreed
that
this
ceremony
should
take
place
the
next
day
they
kept
their
promise
and
i
was
pleasantly
engaged
for
two
hours
the
next
morning
and
was
at
last
obliged
to
extinguish
in
the
mother
the
flames
her
daughter
had
kindled
in
my
breast
although
the
toscani
was
young
enough
she
would
have
found
me
ice
if
her
daughter
had
been
able
to
satisfy
my
desires
but
she
did
not
trust
me
well
enough
to
leave
us
alone
together
as
it
was
she
was
well
satisfied
i
resolved
then
on
going
to
stuttgart
in
company
with
the
two
nymphs
and
i
expected
to
see
there
the
binetti
who
was
always
an
enthusiastic
admirer
of
mine
this
actress
was
the
daughter
of
a
roman
boatman
i
had
helped
her
to
get
on
the
boards
the
same
year
that
madame
de
valmarana
had
married
her
to
a
french
dancer
named
binet
whose
name
she
had
italianized
by
the
addition
of
one
syllable
like
those
who
ennoble
themselves
by
adding
another
syllable
to
their
names
i
also
expected
to
see
the
gardella
young
baletti
of
whom
i
was
very
fond
his
young
wife
the
vulcani
and
several
other
of
my
old
friends
who
i
thought
would
combine
to
make
my
stay
at
stuttgart
a
very
pleasant
one
but
it
will
be
seen
that
it
is
a
risky
thing
to
reckon
without
one
host
at
the
last
posting
station
i
bid
adieu
to
my
two
friends
and
went
to
the
bear
chapter
xii
gardella
portrait
of
the
duke
of
wurtemburg
my
dinner
with
gardella
and
its
consequences
unfortunate
meeting
i
play
and
lose
four
thousand
louis
lawsuit
lucky
flight
my
arrival
at
zurich
church
consecrated
by
jesus
christ
himself
at
that
period
the
court
of
the
duke
of
wurtemburg
was
the
most
brilliant
in
europe
the
heavy
subsidies
paid
by
france
for
quartering
ten
thousand
men
upon
him
furnished
him
with
the
means
for
indulging
in
luxury
and
debauchery
the
army
in
question
was
a
fine
body
of
men
but
during
the
war
it
was
distinguished
only
by
its
blunders
the
duke
was
sumptuous
in
his
tastes
which
were
for
splendid
palaces
hunting
establishments
on
a
large
scale
enormous
stables
in
short
every
whim
imaginable
but
his
chief
expense
was
the
large
salaries
he
paid
his
theatre
and
above
all
his
mistresses
he
had
a
french
play
an
italian
opera
grand
and
comic
and
twenty
italian
dancers
all
of
whom
had
been
principal
dancers
in
italian
theatres
his
director
of
ballets
was
novers
and
sometimes
five
hundred
dancers
appeared
at
once
a
clever
machinist
and
the
best
scene
painters
did
their
best
to
make
the
audience
believe
in
magic
all
the
were
pretty
and
all
of
them
boasted
of
having
been
enjoyed
at
least
once
by
my
lord
the
chief
of
them
was
a
venetian
daughter
of
a
gondolier
named
gardella
she
was
brought
up
by
the
senator
malipiero
whom
my
readers
know
for
his
good
offices
towards
myself
who
had
her
taught
for
the
theatre
and
gave
her
a
i
found
her
at
munich
after
my
flight
from
the
leads
married
to
michel
agata
the
duke
took
a
fancy
to
her
and
asked
her
husband
who
was
only
too
happy
to
agree
to
yield
her
but
he
was
satisfied
with
her
charms
in
a
year
and
put
her
on
the
retired
list
with
the
title
of
madame
this
honour
had
made
all
the
other
jealous
and
they
all
thought
themselves
as
fit
as
she
to
be
taken
to
the
duke
titular
mistress
especially
as
she
only
enjoyed
the
honour
without
the
pleasure
they
all
intrigued
to
procure
her
dismissal
but
the
venetian
lady
succeeded
in
holding
her
ground
against
all
cabals
far
from
reproaching
the
duke
for
this
incorrigible
infidelity
she
encouraged
him
in
it
and
was
very
glad
to
be
left
to
herself
as
she
cared
nothing
for
him
her
chief
pleasure
was
to
have
the
who
aspired
to
the
honours
of
the
handkerchief
come
to
her
to
solicit
her
good
offices
she
always
received
them
politely
gave
them
her
advice
and
bade
them
do
their
best
to
please
the
prince
in
his
turn
the
duke
thought
himself
bound
to
shew
his
gratitude
for
her
good
nature
and
gave
her
in
public
all
the
honours
which
could
be
given
to
a
princess
i
was
not
long
in
finding
out
that
the
duke
chief
desire
was
to
be
talked
about
he
would
have
liked
people
to
say
that
there
was
not
a
prince
in
europe
to
compare
with
him
for
wit
taste
genius
in
the
invention
of
pleasures
and
capacities
he
would
fain
be
regarded
as
a
hercules
in
the
pleasures
of
bacchus
and
venus
and
none
the
less
an
aristides
in
governing
his
people
he
dismissed
without
pity
an
attendant
who
failed
to
wake
him
after
he
had
been
forced
to
yield
to
sleep
for
three
or
four
hours
but
he
did
not
care
how
roughly
he
was
awakened
it
has
happened
that
after
having
given
his
highness
a
large
cup
of
coffee
the
servant
has
been
obliged
to
throw
him
into
a
bath
of
cold
water
where
the
duke
had
to
choose
between
awaking
or
drowning
as
soon
as
he
was
dressed
the
duke
would
assemble
his
council
and
dispatch
whatever
business
was
on
hand
and
then
he
would
give
audience
to
whoever
cared
to
come
into
his
presence
nothing
could
be
more
comic
than
the
audiences
he
gave
to
his
poorer
subjects
often
there
came
to
him
dull
peasants
and
workmen
of
the
lowest
class
the
poor
duke
would
sweat
and
rage
to
make
them
hear
reason
in
which
he
was
sometimes
unsuccessful
and
his
petitioners
would
go
away
terrified
desperate
and
furious
as
to
the
pretty
country
maidens
he
examined
into
their
complaints
in
private
and
though
he
seldom
did
anything
for
them
they
went
away
consoled
the
subsidies
which
the
french
crown
was
foolish
enough
to
pay
him
for
a
perfectly
useless
service
did
not
suffice
for
his
extravagant
expenses
he
loaded
his
subjects
with
taxes
till
the
patient
people
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
some
years
after
had
recourse
to
the
diet
of
wetzlar
which
obliged
him
to
change
his
system
he
was
foolish
enough
to
wish
to
imitate
the
king
of
prussia
while
that
monarch
made
fun
of
the
duke
and
called
him
his
ape
his
wife
was
the
daughter
of
the
margrave
of
bayreuth
the
prettiest
and
most
accomplished
princess
in
all
germany
when
i
had
come
to
stuttgart
she
was
no
longer
there
she
had
taken
refuge
with
her
father
on
account
of
a
disgraceful
affront
which
had
been
offered
her
by
her
unworthy
husband
it
is
incorrect
to
say
that
this
princess
fled
from
her
husband
because
of
his
infidelities
after
i
had
dined
by
myself
i
dressed
and
went
to
the
opera
provided
gratis
by
the
duke
in
the
fine
theatre
he
had
built
the
prince
was
in
the
front
of
the
orchestra
surrounded
by
his
brilliant
court
i
sat
in
a
box
on
the
first
tier
delighted
to
be
able
to
hear
so
well
the
music
of
the
famous
jumella
who
was
in
the
duke
service
in
my
ignorance
of
the
etiquette
of
small
german
courts
i
happened
to
applaud
a
solo
which
had
been
exquisitely
sung
by
a
castrato
whose
name
i
have
forgotten
and
directly
afterwards
an
individual
came
into
my
box
and
addressed
me
in
a
rude
manner
however
i
knew
no
german
and
could
only
answer
by
verstand
i
do
understand
he
went
out
and
soon
after
an
official
came
in
who
told
me
in
good
french
that
when
the
sovereign
was
present
all
applause
was
forbidden
very
good
sir
then
i
will
go
away
and
come
again
when
the
sovereign
is
not
here
as
when
an
air
pleases
me
i
always
applaud
after
this
reply
i
called
for
my
carriage
but
just
as
i
was
getting
into
it
the
same
official
came
and
told
me
that
the
duke
wanted
to
speak
to
me
i
accordingly
followed
him
to
the
presence
you
are
casanova
are
you
said
the
duke
yes
my
lord
where
do
you
come
from
from
cologne
is
this
the
first
time
you
have
been
to
stuttgart
yes
my
lord
do
you
think
of
staying
long
for
five
or
six
days
if
your
highness
will
allow
me
certainly
you
may
stay
as
long
as
you
like
and
you
may
clap
when
you
please
i
shall
profit
by
your
permission
my
lord
good
i
sat
down
again
and
the
whole
audience
settled
down
to
the
play
soon
after
an
actor
sung
an
air
which
the
duke
applauded
and
of
course
all
the
courtiers
but
not
caring
much
for
the
song
i
sat
still
everyone
to
his
taste
after
the
ballet
the
duke
went
to
the
favourite
box
kissed
her
hand
and
left
the
theatre
an
official
who
was
sitting
by
me
and
did
not
know
that
i
was
acquainted
with
the
gardella
told
me
that
as
i
had
had
the
honour
of
speaking
to
the
prince
i
might
obtain
the
honour
of
kissing
his
favourite
hand
i
felt
a
strong
inclination
to
laugh
but
i
restrained
myself
and
a
sudden
and
very
irrational
impulse
made
me
say
that
she
was
a
relation
of
mine
the
words
had
no
sooner
escaped
me
than
i
bit
my
lip
for
this
stupid
lie
could
only
do
me
harm
but
it
was
decreed
that
i
should
do
nothing
at
stuttgart
but
commit
blunders
the
officer
who
seemed
astonished
at
my
reply
bowed
and
went
to
the
favourite
box
to
inform
her
of
my
presence
the
gardelia
looked
in
my
direction
and
beckoned
to
me
with
her
fan
and
i
hastened
to
comply
with
the
invitation
laughing
inwardly
at
the
part
i
was
going
to
play
as
soon
as
i
came
in
she
graciously
gave
me
her
hand
which
i
kissed
calling
her
my
cousin
did
you
tell
the
duke
you
were
my
cousin
said
she
no
i
replied
very
good
then
i
will
do
so
myself
come
and
dine
with
me
she
then
left
the
house
and
i
went
to
visit
the
who
were
undressing
the
binetti
who
was
one
of
the
oldest
of
my
acquaintances
was
in
an
ecstasy
of
joy
at
seeing
me
and
asked
me
to
dine
with
her
every
day
cartz
the
violin
who
had
been
with
me
in
the
orchestra
at
samuel
introduced
me
to
his
pretty
daughter
saying
she
is
not
made
for
the
duke
eyes
to
gaze
on
and
he
shall
never
have
her
the
good
man
was
no
prophet
as
the
duke
got
possession
of
her
a
short
time
after
she
presented
him
with
two
babies
but
these
pledges
of
affection
could
not
fix
the
inconstant
prince
nevertheless
she
was
a
girl
of
the
most
captivating
kind
for
to
the
most
perfect
beauty
she
added
grace
wit
goodness
and
kindness
which
won
everyone
heart
but
the
duke
was
satiated
and
his
only
pleasure
lay
in
novelty
after
her
i
saw
the
vulcani
whom
i
had
known
at
dresden
and
who
suddenly
presented
her
husband
to
me
he
threw
his
arms
round
my
neck
he
was
baletti
brother
of
my
faithless
one
a
young
man
of
great
talent
of
whom
i
was
very
fond
i
was
surrounded
by
all
these
friends
when
the
officer
whom
i
had
so
foolishly
told
that
i
was
related
to
the
gardella
came
in
and
began
to
tell
the
story
the
binetti
after
hearing
it
said
to
him
it
a
lie
but
my
dear
said
i
to
her
you
ca
be
better
informed
on
the
subject
than
i
am
she
replied
by
laughing
but
cartz
said
very
wittily
as
gardella
is
only
a
boatman
daughter
like
binetti
the
latter
thinks
and
very
rightly
that
you
ought
to
have
given
her
the
refusal
of
your
cousinship
next
day
i
had
a
pleasant
dinner
with
the
favourite
though
she
told
me
that
not
having
seen
the
duke
she
could
not
tell
me
how
he
would
take
my
pleasantry
which
her
mother
resented
very
much
this
mother
of
hers
a
woman
of
the
lowest
birth
had
become
very
proud
since
her
daughter
was
a
prince
mistress
and
thought
my
relationship
a
blot
on
their
escutcheon
she
had
the
impudence
to
tell
me
that
her
relations
had
never
been
players
without
reflecting
that
it
must
be
worse
to
descend
to
this
estate
than
to
rise
from
it
if
it
were
dishonourable
i
ought
to
have
pitied
her
but
not
being
of
a
forbearing
nature
i
retorted
by
asking
if
her
sister
was
still
alive
a
question
which
made
her
frown
and
to
which
she
gave
no
answer
the
sister
i
spoke
of
was
a
fat
blind
woman
who
begged
on
a
bridge
in
venice
after
having
spent
a
pleasant
day
with
the
favourite
who
was
the
oldest
of
my
theatrical
friends
i
left
her
promising
to
come
to
breakfast
the
next
day
but
as
i
was
going
out
the
porter
bade
me
not
to
put
my
feet
there
again
but
would
not
say
on
whose
authority
he
gave
me
this
polite
order
it
would
have
been
wiser
to
hold
my
tongue
as
this
stroke
must
have
come
from
the
mother
or
perhaps
from
the
daughter
whose
vanity
i
had
wounded
she
was
a
actress
to
conceal
her
anger
i
was
angry
with
myself
and
went
away
in
an
ill
humour
i
was
humiliated
to
see
myself
treated
in
such
a
manner
by
a
wretched
wanton
of
an
actress
though
if
i
had
been
more
discreet
i
could
have
got
a
welcome
in
the
best
society
if
i
had
not
promised
to
dine
with
binetti
the
next
day
i
should
have
posted
off
forthwith
and
i
should
thus
have
escaped
all
the
misadventures
which
befell
me
in
that
wretched
town
the
binetti
lived
in
the
house
of
her
lover
the
austrian
ambassador
and
the
part
of
the
house
she
occupied
adjoined
the
town
wall
as
will
be
seen
this
detail
is
an
important
one
i
dined
alone
with
my
good
and
if
i
had
felt
myself
capable
of
love
at
that
period
all
my
old
affection
would
have
resumed
its
sway
over
me
as
her
beauty
was
undiminished
and
she
had
more
tact
and
knowledge
of
the
world
than
when
i
knew
her
formerly
the
austrian
ambassador
was
a
easygoing
and
generous
man
as
for
her
husband
he
was
not
worthy
of
her
and
she
never
saw
him
i
spent
a
pleasant
day
with
her
talking
of
our
old
friends
and
as
i
had
nothing
to
keep
me
in
wurtemburg
i
decided
to
leave
in
two
days
as
i
had
promised
the
toscani
and
her
daughter
to
go
with
them
on
the
next
day
to
louisbourg
we
were
to
start
at
five
in
the
morning
but
the
following
adventure
befell
me
as
i
was
leaving
binetti
house
i
was
greeted
very
courteously
by
three
officers
whom
i
had
become
acquainted
with
at
the
coffee
house
and
i
walked
along
the
promenade
with
them
we
are
going
said
one
of
them
to
visit
certain
ladies
of
easy
virtue
we
shall
be
glad
to
have
you
of
our
company
i
only
speak
a
few
words
of
german
i
answered
and
if
i
join
you
i
shall
be
bored
ah
but
the
ladies
are
italians
they
exclaimed
nothing
could
suit
you
better
i
did
not
at
all
like
following
them
but
my
evil
genius
led
me
in
that
wretched
town
from
one
blunder
to
another
and
so
i
went
in
spite
of
myself
we
turned
back
into
the
town
and
i
let
myself
be
led
up
to
the
third
floor
of
an
house
and
in
the
meanest
of
rooms
i
saw
the
pretended
nieces
of
peccini
a
moment
after
peccini
appeared
and
had
the
impudence
to
throw
his
arms
around
my
neck
calling
me
his
best
friend
his
nieces
overwhelmed
me
with
caresses
and
seemed
to
confirm
the
idea
that
we
were
old
friends
i
did
nothing
and
held
my
tongue
the
officers
prepared
for
a
debauch
i
did
not
imitate
their
example
but
this
made
no
difference
to
them
i
saw
into
what
an
evil
place
i
had
been
decoyed
but
a
false
shame
prevented
me
from
leaving
the
house
without
ceremony
i
was
wrong
but
i
determined
to
be
more
prudent
for
the
future
before
long
a
supper
was
served
of
which
i
did
not
partake
but
not
wishing
to
seem
bad
company
i
drank
two
or
three
small
glasses
of
hungarian
wine
after
supper
which
did
not
last
very
long
cards
were
produced
and
one
of
the
officers
held
a
bank
at
faro
i
punted
and
lost
the
fifty
or
sixty
louis
i
had
about
me
i
felt
that
i
was
drunk
my
head
was
reeling
and
i
would
have
gladly
given
over
playing
and
gone
away
but
i
have
never
been
so
possessed
as
on
that
day
either
from
false
shame
or
from
the
effects
of
the
drugged
wine
they
gave
me
my
noble
officers
seemed
vexed
that
i
had
lost
and
would
give
me
my
revenge
they
made
me
hold
a
bank
of
a
hundred
louis
in
fish
which
they
counted
out
to
me
i
did
so
and
lost
i
made
a
bank
again
and
again
i
lost
my
inflamed
understanding
my
increasing
drunkenness
and
my
anger
deprived
me
of
all
sense
and
i
kept
increasing
my
bank
losing
all
the
time
till
at
midnight
my
good
rascals
declared
they
would
play
no
more
they
made
a
calculation
and
declared
that
i
had
lost
nearly
a
hundred
thousand
francs
so
great
was
my
intoxication
although
i
had
had
no
more
wine
that
they
were
obliged
to
send
for
a
sedan
chair
to
take
me
to
my
inn
while
my
servant
was
undressing
me
he
discovered
that
i
had
neither
my
watches
nor
my
gold
do
forget
to
wake
me
at
four
in
the
morning
said
therewith
i
went
to
bed
and
enjoyed
a
calm
and
refreshing
sleep
while
i
was
dressing
next
morning
i
found
a
hundred
louis
in
my
pocket
at
which
i
was
much
astonished
for
my
dizziness
of
brain
being
over
now
i
remembered
that
i
had
not
this
money
about
me
the
evening
before
but
my
mind
was
taken
up
with
the
pleasure
party
and
i
put
off
thinking
of
this
incident
and
of
my
enormous
losses
till
afterwards
i
went
to
the
toscani
and
we
set
out
for
louisbourg
where
we
had
a
capital
dinner
and
my
spirits
ran
so
high
that
my
companions
could
never
have
guessed
the
misfortune
that
had
just
befallen
me
we
went
back
to
stuttgart
in
the
evening
when
i
got
home
my
spaniard
told
me
that
they
knew
nothing
about
my
watches
and
at
the
house
where
i
had
been
the
evening
before
and
that
the
three
officers
had
come
to
call
on
me
but
not
finding
me
at
home
they
had
told
him
to
warn
me
that
they
would
breakfast
with
me
on
the
following
morning
they
kept
the
appointment
gentlemen
said
i
as
soon
as
they
came
in
i
have
lost
a
sum
which
i
can
not
pay
and
which
i
certainly
should
not
have
lost
without
the
drugged
wine
you
gave
me
you
have
taken
me
to
a
den
of
infamy
where
i
was
shamefully
robbed
of
jewellery
to
the
value
of
more
than
three
hundred
louis
i
complain
of
no
one
since
i
have
only
my
own
folly
to
complain
of
if
i
had
been
wiser
all
this
would
not
have
happened
to
me
they
exclaimed
loudly
at
this
speech
and
tried
to
play
the
part
of
men
of
honour
they
spoke
in
vain
as
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
pay
nothing
whilst
we
were
in
the
thick
of
the
fight
and
were
beginning
to
get
angry
over
it
baletti
toscani
and
binetti
came
in
and
heard
the
discussion
i
then
had
breakfast
brought
in
and
after
we
had
finished
my
friends
left
me
when
we
were
once
more
alone
one
of
the
rascals
addressed
me
as
follows
we
are
too
honest
sir
to
take
advantage
of
your
position
you
have
been
unfortunate
but
all
men
are
sometimes
unfortunate
and
we
ask
nothing
better
than
a
mutual
accommodation
we
will
take
over
all
your
properties
jewels
diamonds
arms
and
carriage
and
have
them
valued
and
if
the
sum
realized
does
not
cover
your
debt
we
will
take
your
acceptance
payable
at
date
and
remain
good
friends
sir
i
do
not
wish
for
the
friendship
of
robbers
and
i
will
not
play
a
single
farthing
at
this
they
tried
threats
but
i
kept
cool
and
said
gentlemen
your
menaces
will
not
intimidate
me
and
as
far
as
i
can
see
you
have
only
two
ways
of
getting
paid
either
by
way
of
the
law
in
which
case
i
do
not
think
i
shall
find
it
difficult
to
get
a
barrister
to
take
up
my
case
or
secondly
you
can
pay
yourselves
on
my
body
honourably
with
sword
in
hand
as
i
had
expected
they
replied
that
if
i
wished
they
would
do
me
the
honour
of
killing
me
after
i
had
paid
them
they
went
off
cursing
telling
me
that
i
would
be
sorry
for
what
i
had
said
soon
after
i
went
out
and
spent
the
day
with
the
toscani
in
gaiety
which
situated
as
i
was
was
not
far
off
madness
at
the
time
i
placed
it
to
the
daughter
charms
and
to
the
need
my
spirits
were
in
of
recovering
their
elasticity
however
the
mother
having
witnessed
the
rage
of
the
three
robbers
was
the
first
to
urge
me
to
fortify
myself
against
their
villainy
by
an
appeal
to
the
law
if
you
give
them
the
start
said
she
they
may
possibly
gain
a
great
advantage
over
you
in
spite
of
the
right
being
on
your
side
and
whilst
i
toyed
with
her
charming
daughter
she
sent
for
a
barrister
after
hearing
my
case
the
counsel
told
me
that
my
best
way
would
be
to
tell
the
whole
story
to
the
sovereign
as
soon
as
possible
they
took
you
to
the
house
of
they
poured
out
the
drugged
wine
which
deprived
you
of
your
reason
they
made
you
play
in
spite
of
their
prince
prohibition
for
gaming
is
strictly
forbidden
in
this
company
you
were
robbed
of
your
jewels
after
they
had
made
you
lose
an
enormous
sum
it
a
hanging
matter
and
the
duke
interest
will
be
to
do
you
justice
for
an
act
of
scoundrelism
like
this
committed
by
his
officers
would
dishonour
him
all
over
europe
i
felt
some
repugnance
to
this
course
for
though
the
duke
was
a
shameless
libertine
i
did
not
like
telling
him
such
a
disgraceful
story
however
the
case
was
a
serious
one
and
after
giving
it
due
reflection
i
determined
to
wait
on
the
dike
on
the
following
morning
as
the
duke
gives
audience
to
the
first
comer
i
said
to
myself
why
should
i
not
have
as
good
a
reception
as
a
labouring
man
in
this
way
i
concluded
that
it
would
be
no
use
to
write
to
him
and
i
was
on
my
way
to
the
court
when
at
about
twenty
paces
from
the
gate
of
the
castle
i
met
my
three
gentlemen
who
accosted
me
rudely
and
said
i
had
better
make
up
my
mind
to
pay
or
else
they
would
play
the
devil
with
me
i
was
going
on
without
paying
any
attention
to
them
when
i
felt
myself
rudely
seized
by
the
right
arm
a
natural
impulse
of
made
me
put
my
hand
to
my
sword
and
i
drew
it
in
a
manner
that
shewed
i
was
in
earnest
the
officer
of
the
guard
came
running
up
and
i
complained
that
the
three
were
assaulting
me
and
endeavouring
to
hinder
my
approach
to
the
prince
on
enquiry
being
made
the
sentry
and
the
numerous
persons
who
were
present
declared
that
i
had
only
drawn
in
so
the
officer
decided
that
i
had
perfect
liberty
to
enter
the
castle
i
was
allowed
to
penetrate
to
the
last
antechamber
without
any
obstacle
being
raised
here
i
addressed
myself
to
the
chamberlain
demanding
an
audience
with
the
sovereign
and
he
assured
me
that
i
should
be
introduced
into
the
presence
but
directly
afterwards
the
impudent
scoundrel
who
had
taken
hold
of
my
arm
came
up
and
began
to
speak
to
the
chamberlain
in
german
he
said
his
say
without
my
being
able
to
contradict
him
and
his
representations
were
doubtless
not
in
my
favour
very
possibly
too
the
chamberlain
was
one
of
the
gang
and
i
went
from
herod
to
pilate
an
hour
went
by
without
my
being
able
to
see
the
prince
and
then
the
chamberlain
who
had
assured
me
that
i
should
have
an
audience
came
and
told
me
that
i
might
go
home
as
the
duke
had
heard
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
and
would
no
doubt
see
that
justice
was
done
me
i
saw
at
once
that
i
should
get
no
justice
at
all
and
as
i
was
walking
away
i
thought
how
best
i
could
get
out
of
the
difficulty
on
my
way
i
met
binetti
who
knew
how
i
was
placed
and
he
asked
me
to
come
and
dine
with
him
assuring
me
that
the
austrian
ambassador
would
take
me
under
his
protection
and
that
he
would
save
me
from
the
violent
measures
which
the
rascals
no
doubt
intended
to
take
in
spite
of
the
assurances
i
accepted
the
invitation
and
binetti
charming
wife
taking
the
affair
to
heart
did
not
lose
a
moment
in
informing
her
lover
the
ambassador
of
all
the
circumstances
this
diplomatist
came
into
the
room
with
her
and
after
hearing
all
the
details
from
my
lips
he
said
that
in
all
probability
the
duke
knew
nothing
about
it
write
a
brief
account
of
the
business
said
he
and
i
will
lay
it
before
the
sovereign
who
will
no
doubt
see
justice
done
i
went
to
binetti
desk
and
as
soon
as
i
had
written
down
my
true
relation
i
gave
it
unsealed
to
the
ambassador
who
assured
me
that
it
should
be
in
the
duke
hands
in
the
course
of
an
hour
at
dinner
my
assured
me
again
that
her
lover
should
protect
me
and
we
spent
the
day
pleasantly
enough
but
towards
evening
my
spaniard
came
and
assured
me
that
if
i
returned
to
the
inn
i
should
be
arrested
for
said
he
an
officer
came
to
see
you
and
finding
you
were
out
he
took
up
his
position
at
the
street
door
and
has
two
soldiers
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
the
binetti
said
you
must
not
go
to
the
inn
stay
here
where
you
have
nothing
to
fear
send
for
what
you
want
and
we
will
wait
and
see
what
happens
i
then
gave
orders
to
my
spaniard
to
go
and
fetch
the
belongings
which
were
absolutely
necessary
to
me
at
midnight
the
ambassador
came
in
we
were
still
up
and
he
seemed
pleased
that
his
mistress
had
sheltered
me
he
assured
me
that
my
plea
had
been
laid
before
the
sovereign
but
during
the
three
days
i
was
in
the
house
i
heard
no
more
about
it
on
the
fourth
day
whilst
i
was
pondering
as
to
how
i
should
act
the
ambassador
received
a
letter
from
a
minister
requesting
him
on
behalf
of
the
sovereign
to
dismiss
me
from
his
house
as
i
had
a
suit
pending
with
certain
officers
of
his
highness
and
whilst
i
was
with
the
ambassador
justice
could
not
take
its
course
the
ambassador
gave
me
the
letter
and
i
saw
that
the
minister
promised
that
strict
justice
should
be
done
me
there
was
no
help
for
it
i
had
to
make
up
my
mind
to
return
to
my
inn
but
the
binetti
was
so
enraged
that
she
began
to
scold
her
lover
at
which
he
laughed
saying
with
perfect
truth
that
he
could
not
keep
me
there
in
defiance
of
the
prince
i
the
inn
without
meeting
anyone
but
when
i
had
had
my
dinner
and
was
just
going
to
see
my
counsel
an
officer
served
me
with
a
summons
which
was
interpreted
to
me
by
my
landlord
which
ordered
me
to
appear
forthwith
before
the
notary
appointed
to
take
my
deposition
i
went
to
him
with
the
officer
of
the
court
and
spent
two
hours
with
the
notary
who
wrote
down
my
deposition
in
german
while
i
gave
it
in
latin
when
it
was
done
he
told
me
to
sign
my
name
to
which
i
answered
that
i
must
decline
to
sign
a
document
i
did
not
understand
he
insisted
on
my
doing
it
but
i
was
immovable
he
then
got
in
a
rage
and
said
i
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
myself
for
suspecting
a
notary
honour
i
replied
calmly
that
i
had
no
doubts
as
to
his
honour
but
that
i
acted
from
principle
and
that
as
i
did
not
understand
what
he
had
written
i
refused
to
sign
it
i
left
him
and
was
accompanied
by
the
officer
to
my
own
counsel
who
said
i
had
done
quite
right
and
promised
to
call
on
me
the
next
day
to
receive
my
power
of
attorney
and
when
i
have
done
that
he
said
your
business
will
be
mine
i
was
comforted
by
this
man
who
inspired
me
with
confidence
and
went
back
to
the
hotel
where
i
made
a
good
supper
and
went
tranquilly
to
sleep
next
morning
however
when
i
awoke
my
spaniard
announced
an
officer
who
had
followed
him
and
told
me
in
good
french
that
i
must
not
be
astonished
to
find
myself
a
prisoner
in
my
room
for
being
a
stranger
and
engaged
in
a
suit
at
law
it
was
only
right
that
the
opposite
party
should
be
assured
that
i
would
not
escape
before
judgment
was
given
he
asked
very
politely
for
my
sword
and
to
my
great
regret
i
was
compelled
to
give
it
him
the
hilt
was
of
steel
exquisitely
chased
it
was
a
present
from
madame
and
was
worth
at
least
fifty
louis
i
wrote
a
note
to
my
counsel
to
tell
him
what
had
happened
he
came
to
see
me
and
assured
me
that
i
should
only
be
under
arrest
for
a
few
days
as
i
was
obliged
to
keep
my
room
i
let
my
friends
know
of
my
confinement
and
i
received
visits
from
dancers
and
who
were
the
only
decent
people
i
was
acquainted
with
in
that
wretched
stuttgart
where
i
had
better
never
have
set
foot
my
situation
was
not
pleasant
to
contemplate
i
had
been
drugged
cheated
robbed
abused
imprisoned
threatened
with
a
mulct
of
a
hundred
thousand
francs
which
would
have
stripped
me
to
my
shirt
as
nobody
knew
the
contents
of
my
i
could
think
of
nothing
else
i
had
written
to
madame
the
gardella
but
to
no
purpose
as
i
got
no
answer
all
the
consolation
i
got
was
from
binetti
toscani
and
baletti
who
dined
or
supped
with
me
every
day
the
three
rascals
came
to
see
me
one
by
one
and
each
tried
to
get
me
to
give
him
money
unknown
to
the
other
two
and
each
promised
that
if
i
would
do
that
he
would
get
me
out
of
the
difficulty
each
would
have
been
content
with
three
or
four
hundred
louis
but
even
if
i
had
given
that
sum
to
one
of
them
i
had
no
guarantee
that
the
others
would
desist
from
their
persecution
indeed
if
i
had
done
so
i
should
have
given
some
ground
to
their
pretensions
and
bad
would
have
been
made
worse
my
answer
was
that
they
wearied
me
and
that
i
should
be
glad
if
they
would
desist
from
visiting
me
on
the
fifth
day
of
my
arrest
the
duke
left
for
frankfort
and
the
same
day
binetti
came
and
told
me
from
her
lover
that
the
duke
had
promised
the
officers
not
to
interfere
and
that
i
was
therefore
in
danger
of
an
iniquitous
sentence
his
advice
was
to
neglect
no
means
of
getting
out
of
the
difficulty
to
sacrifice
all
my
property
diamonds
and
jewellery
and
thus
to
obtain
a
release
from
my
enemies
the
binetti
like
a
wise
woman
disliked
this
counsel
and
i
relished
it
still
less
but
she
had
to
perform
her
commission
i
had
jewellery
and
lace
to
the
value
of
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
francs
but
i
could
not
resolve
to
make
the
sacrifice
i
did
not
know
which
way
to
turn
or
where
to
go
and
while
i
was
in
this
state
of
mind
my
barrister
came
in
he
spoke
as
follows
sir
all
my
endeavors
on
your
behalf
have
been
unsuccessful
there
is
a
party
against
you
which
seems
to
have
support
in
some
high
quarter
and
which
silences
the
voice
of
justice
it
is
my
duty
to
warn
you
that
unless
you
find
some
way
of
arranging
matters
with
these
rascals
you
are
a
ruined
man
the
judgment
given
by
the
police
magistrate
a
rascal
like
the
rest
of
them
is
of
a
summary
character
for
as
a
stranger
you
will
not
be
allowed
to
have
recourse
to
the
delays
of
the
law
you
would
require
bail
to
do
that
they
have
managed
to
procure
witnesses
who
swear
that
you
are
a
professional
gamester
that
it
was
you
who
seduced
the
three
officers
into
the
house
of
your
countryman
peccini
that
it
is
not
true
that
your
wine
was
drugged
that
you
did
not
lose
your
watches
nor
your
for
they
say
these
articles
will
be
found
in
your
mails
when
your
goods
are
sold
for
that
you
will
only
have
to
wait
till
or
the
day
after
and
do
not
think
that
i
am
deceiving
you
in
any
particular
or
you
will
be
sorry
for
it
they
will
come
here
and
empty
your
mails
boxes
and
pockets
a
list
will
be
made
and
they
will
be
sold
by
auction
the
same
day
if
the
sum
realized
is
greater
than
the
debt
the
surplus
will
go
in
costs
and
you
may
depend
upon
it
that
a
very
small
sum
will
be
returned
to
you
but
if
on
the
other
hand
the
sum
is
not
sufficient
to
pay
everything
including
the
debt
costs
expenses
of
the
auction
you
will
be
enrolled
as
a
common
soldier
in
the
forces
of
his
most
serene
highness
i
heard
it
said
to
the
officer
who
is
your
greatest
creditor
that
the
four
louis
enlistment
money
would
be
taken
into
account
and
that
the
duke
would
be
glad
to
get
hold
of
such
a
fine
man
the
barrister
left
me
without
my
noticing
him
i
was
so
petrified
by
what
he
had
said
i
was
in
such
a
state
of
collapse
that
in
less
than
an
hour
all
the
liquids
in
my
body
must
have
escaped
i
a
common
soldier
in
the
army
of
a
petty
sovereign
like
the
duke
who
only
existed
by
the
horrible
traffic
in
human
flesh
which
he
carried
on
after
the
manner
of
the
elector
of
hesse
i
despoiled
by
those
knaves
the
victim
of
an
iniquitous
sentence
never
i
would
endeavour
to
hit
upon
some
plan
to
gain
time
i
began
by
writing
to
my
chief
creditor
that
i
had
decided
to
come
to
an
agreement
with
them
but
i
wished
them
all
to
wait
upon
my
notary
with
witnesses
to
put
a
formal
close
to
the
action
and
render
me
a
free
man
again
i
calculated
that
one
of
them
was
sure
to
be
on
duty
on
the
morrow
and
thus
i
should
gain
a
day
at
any
rate
in
the
mean
time
i
hoped
to
discover
some
way
of
escape
i
next
wrote
to
the
head
of
the
police
whom
i
styled
your
excellency
and
my
lord
begging
him
to
vouchsafe
his
protection
i
told
him
that
i
had
resolved
on
selling
all
my
property
to
put
an
end
to
the
suit
which
threatened
to
overwhelm
me
and
i
begged
him
to
suspend
the
proceedings
the
cost
of
which
could
only
add
to
my
difficulties
i
also
asked
him
to
send
me
a
trustworthy
man
to
value
my
effects
as
soon
as
i
had
come
to
an
agreement
with
my
creditors
with
whom
i
begged
for
his
good
offices
when
i
had
done
i
sent
my
spaniard
to
deliver
the
letters
the
officer
to
whom
i
had
written
who
pretended
that
i
was
his
debtor
to
the
amount
of
two
thousand
louis
came
to
see
me
after
dinner
i
was
in
bed
and
i
told
him
i
thought
i
had
fever
he
began
to
offer
his
sympathy
and
genuine
or
not
i
was
pleased
with
it
he
told
me
he
had
just
had
some
conversation
with
the
chief
of
the
police
who
had
shewn
him
my
letter
you
are
very
wise
said
he
in
consenting
to
a
composition
but
we
need
not
all
three
be
present
i
have
full
powers
from
the
other
two
and
that
will
be
sufficient
for
the
notary
i
am
in
bad
enough
case
i
replied
for
you
to
grant
me
the
favour
of
seeing
you
all
together
i
can
not
think
you
will
refuse
me
well
well
you
shall
be
satisfied
but
if
you
are
in
a
hurry
to
leave
stuttgart
i
must
warn
you
that
we
can
not
come
before
monday
for
we
are
on
duty
for
the
next
four
days
i
am
sorry
to
hear
it
but
i
will
wait
give
me
your
word
of
honour
that
all
proceedings
shall
be
suspended
in
the
mean
time
certainly
here
is
my
hand
and
you
may
reckon
on
me
in
my
turn
i
have
a
favour
to
ask
i
like
your
will
you
let
me
have
it
for
what
it
cost
you
with
pleasure
be
kind
enough
to
call
the
landlord
and
tell
him
in
my
presence
that
the
carriage
belongs
to
me
i
had
the
landlord
upstairs
and
did
as
the
rascal
had
asked
me
but
mine
host
told
him
that
he
could
dispose
of
it
after
he
had
paid
for
it
and
with
that
he
turned
his
back
on
him
and
left
the
room
i
am
certain
of
having
the
chaise
said
the
officer
laughing
he
then
embraced
me
and
went
away
i
had
derived
so
much
pleasure
from
my
talk
with
him
that
i
felt
quite
another
man
i
had
four
days
before
me
it
was
a
rare
piece
of
good
luck
some
hours
after
an
fellow
who
spoke
italian
well
came
to
tell
me
from
the
chief
of
police
that
my
creditors
would
meet
on
the
ensuing
monday
and
that
he
himself
was
appointed
to
value
my
goods
he
advised
me
to
make
it
a
condition
of
the
agreement
that
my
goods
should
not
be
sold
by
auction
and
that
my
creditors
should
consider
his
valuation
as
final
and
binding
he
told
me
that
i
should
congratulate
myself
if
i
followed
his
advice
i
told
him
that
i
would
not
forget
his
services
and
begged
him
to
examine
my
mails
and
my
he
examined
everything
and
told
me
that
my
lace
alone
was
worth
twenty
thousand
francs
in
all
he
added
your
goods
are
worth
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
francs
but
i
promise
to
tell
your
adversaries
another
story
thus
if
you
can
persuade
them
to
take
half
their
debt
you
will
get
off
with
half
your
effects
in
that
ease
i
said
you
shall
have
fifty
louis
and
here
are
six
as
an
earnest
i
am
grateful
to
you
and
you
can
count
upon
my
devotion
the
whole
town
and
the
duke
as
well
know
your
creditors
to
be
knaves
but
they
have
their
reasons
for
refusing
to
see
their
conduct
in
its
true
light
i
breathed
again
and
now
all
my
thoughts
were
concentrated
on
making
my
escape
with
all
i
possessed
my
poor
chaise
excepted
i
had
a
difficult
task
before
me
but
not
so
difficult
a
one
as
my
flight
from
the
leads
and
the
recollection
of
my
great
escape
gave
me
fresh
courage
my
first
step
was
to
ask
toscani
baletti
and
the
dancer
binetti
to
supper
as
i
had
measures
to
concert
with
these
friends
of
mine
whom
i
could
rely
on
and
who
had
nothing
to
fear
from
the
resentment
of
three
rascals
after
we
had
had
a
good
supper
i
told
them
how
the
affair
stood
and
that
i
was
determined
to
escape
and
to
carry
my
goods
with
me
and
now
i
said
i
want
your
advice
after
a
brief
silence
binetti
said
if
i
could
get
to
his
house
i
could
lower
myself
down
from
a
window
and
once
on
the
ground
i
should
be
outside
the
town
walls
and
at
a
distance
of
a
hundred
paces
from
the
high
road
by
which
i
could
travel
post
and
be
out
of
the
duke
dominions
by
daybreak
thereupon
baletti
opened
the
window
and
found
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
escape
that
way
on
account
of
a
wooden
roof
above
a
shop
i
looked
out
also
and
seeing
that
he
was
right
i
said
that
i
should
no
doubt
hit
on
some
way
of
making
my
escape
from
the
inn
but
what
troubled
me
chiefly
was
my
luggage
the
toscani
then
said
you
will
have
to
abandon
your
mails
which
you
could
not
take
off
without
attracting
attention
and
you
must
send
all
your
effects
to
my
house
i
engage
to
deliver
safely
whatever
you
may
put
in
my
care
i
will
take
away
your
effects
under
my
clothes
in
several
journeys
and
i
can
begin
baletti
thought
this
idea
a
good
one
and
said
that
to
do
it
the
quicker
his
wife
would
come
and
help
we
fixed
on
this
plan
and
i
promised
binetti
to
be
with
him
at
midnight
on
sunday
even
if
i
had
to
stab
the
sentry
who
was
at
my
door
all
day
but
who
went
away
at
night
after
locking
me
in
baletti
said
he
would
provide
me
with
a
faithful
servant
and
a
with
swift
horses
which
would
take
my
effects
in
other
mails
to
make
the
best
use
of
the
time
the
toscani
began
to
load
herself
putting
two
of
my
suits
of
clothes
under
her
dress
for
the
next
few
days
my
friends
served
me
so
well
that
at
midnight
on
saturday
my
mails
and
my
dressing
case
were
empty
i
kept
back
all
the
jewellery
intending
to
carry
it
in
my
pocket
on
sunday
the
toscani
brought
me
the
keys
of
the
two
mails
in
which
she
had
put
my
goods
and
baletti
came
also
to
tell
me
that
all
the
necessary
measures
had
been
taken
and
that
i
should
find
a
under
the
charge
of
his
servant
waiting
for
me
on
the
high
road
so
far
good
and
the
reader
shall
now
hear
how
i
contrived
to
escape
from
my
inn
the
sentry
confined
himself
to
a
small
where
he
walked
up
and
down
without
ever
coming
into
my
room
except
at
my
invitation
as
soon
as
he
heard
that
i
had
gone
to
bed
he
locked
the
door
and
went
off
till
the
next
day
he
used
to
sup
on
a
little
table
in
a
corner
of
the
his
food
being
sent
out
by
me
profiting
by
my
knowledge
of
his
habits
i
gave
my
spaniard
the
following
instructions
after
supper
instead
of
going
to
bed
i
shall
hold
myself
in
readiness
for
leaving
my
room
and
i
shall
leave
it
when
i
see
the
light
extinguished
in
the
while
i
shall
take
care
that
my
candle
be
so
placed
as
not
to
shew
any
light
outside
or
to
reflect
my
shadow
once
out
of
my
room
i
shall
have
no
difficulty
in
reaching
the
stairs
and
my
escape
will
be
accomplished
i
shall
go
to
binetti
leave
the
town
by
his
house
and
wait
for
you
at
furstenburg
no
one
can
hinder
you
from
joining
me
in
the
course
of
a
day
or
two
so
when
you
see
me
ready
in
my
room
and
this
will
be
whilst
the
sentry
is
having
his
supper
put
out
the
candle
on
the
table
you
can
easily
manage
to
do
so
whilst
snuffing
it
you
will
then
take
it
to
it
and
i
shall
seize
that
moment
to
get
off
in
the
darkness
when
you
conclude
that
i
have
got
out
of
the
you
can
come
back
to
the
soldier
with
the
lighted
candle
and
you
can
help
him
to
finish
his
bottle
by
that
time
i
shall
be
safe
and
when
you
tell
him
i
have
gone
to
bed
he
will
come
to
the
door
wish
me
good
night
and
after
locking
the
door
and
putting
the
key
in
his
pocket
he
will
go
away
with
you
it
is
not
likely
that
he
will
come
in
and
speak
to
me
when
he
hears
i
have
gone
to
bed
nevertheless
as
he
might
possibly
take
it
into
his
head
to
come
into
the
room
i
carefully
arranged
a
in
a
on
the
pillow
and
huddled
up
the
coverlet
so
as
to
deceive
a
casual
glance
all
my
plans
were
successful
as
i
heard
afterwards
from
my
spaniard
whilst
he
was
drinking
with
the
sentry
i
was
getting
on
my
great
coat
girding
on
my
hanger
i
had
no
longer
a
sword
and
putting
my
loaded
pistols
in
my
pocket
as
soon
as
the
darkness
told
me
that
le
duc
had
put
out
the
candle
i
went
out
softly
and
reached
the
staircase
without
making
the
least
noise
once
there
the
rest
was
easy
for
the
stair
led
into
the
passage
and
the
passage
to
the
main
door
which
was
always
open
till
nearly
midnight
i
stepped
out
along
the
street
and
at
a
quarter
to
twelve
i
got
to
binetti
and
found
his
wife
looking
out
for
me
at
the
window
when
i
was
in
the
room
whence
i
intended
to
escape
we
lost
no
time
i
threw
my
overcoat
to
baletti
who
was
standing
in
the
ditch
below
up
to
the
knees
in
mud
and
binding
a
strong
cord
round
my
waist
i
embraced
the
binetti
and
baletti
wife
who
lowered
me
down
as
gently
as
possible
baletti
received
me
in
his
arms
i
cut
the
cord
and
after
taking
my
great
coat
i
followed
his
footsteps
we
strode
through
the
mud
and
going
along
a
hedge
we
reached
the
high
road
in
a
state
of
exhaustion
although
it
was
not
more
than
a
hundred
paces
as
the
crow
flies
from
where
we
stood
to
the
house
at
a
little
distance
off
beside
a
small
wayside
inn
we
found
the
postchaise
in
which
sat
baletti
servant
he
got
out
telling
us
that
the
postillion
had
just
gone
into
the
inn
to
have
a
glass
of
beer
and
light
his
pipe
i
took
the
good
servant
place
and
gave
him
a
reward
and
begged
them
both
to
be
gone
saying
i
would
manage
all
the
rest
myself
it
was
april
and
my
birthday
and
a
remarkable
period
in
my
career
although
my
whole
life
has
been
filled
with
adventures
good
or
bad
i
had
been
in
the
carriage
for
two
or
three
minutes
when
the
postillion
came
and
asked
me
if
we
had
much
longer
to
wait
he
thought
he
was
speaking
to
the
same
person
that
he
had
left
in
the
chaise
and
i
did
not
undeceive
him
drive
on
i
answered
and
make
one
stage
of
it
from
here
to
tubingen
without
changing
horses
at
waldenbach
he
followed
my
instructions
and
we
went
along
at
a
good
pace
but
i
had
a
strong
inclination
to
laugh
at
the
face
he
made
when
he
saw
me
at
tubingen
baletti
servant
was
a
youth
and
slightly
built
i
was
tall
and
quite
a
man
he
opened
his
eyes
to
their
utmost
width
and
told
me
i
was
not
the
same
gentleman
that
was
in
the
carriage
when
he
started
drunk
said
i
putting
in
his
hand
four
times
what
he
was
accustomed
to
get
and
the
poor
devil
did
not
say
a
word
who
has
not
experienced
the
persuasive
influence
of
money
i
went
on
my
journey
and
did
not
stop
till
i
reached
furstenburg
where
i
was
quite
safe
i
had
eaten
nothing
on
the
way
and
by
the
time
i
got
to
the
inn
i
was
dying
of
hunger
i
had
a
good
supper
brought
to
me
and
then
i
went
to
bed
and
slept
well
as
soon
as
i
awoke
i
wrote
to
my
three
rascals
i
promised
to
wait
ten
days
for
them
at
the
place
from
which
i
dated
the
letter
and
i
challenged
them
to
a
duel
a
swearing
that
i
would
publish
their
cowardice
all
over
europe
if
they
refused
to
measure
swords
with
me
i
next
wrote
to
the
toscani
to
baletti
and
to
the
mistress
of
the
austrian
ambassador
commending
le
duc
to
their
care
and
thanking
them
for
their
friendly
help
the
three
rascals
did
not
come
but
the
landlord
two
daughters
both
of
them
pretty
made
me
pass
the
three
days
very
agreeably
on
the
fourth
day
towards
noon
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
my
faithful
spaniard
riding
into
the
town
carrying
his
portmanteau
on
his
saddle
sir
said
he
all
stuttgart
knows
you
to
be
here
and
i
fear
lest
the
three
officers
who
were
too
cowardly
to
accept
your
challenge
may
have
you
assassinated
if
you
are
wise
you
will
set
out
for
switzerland
forthwith
that
cowardly
my
lad
said
i
do
be
afraid
about
me
but
tell
me
all
that
happened
after
my
escape
as
soon
as
you
were
gone
sir
i
carried
out
your
instructions
and
helped
the
poor
devil
of
a
sentry
to
empty
his
bottle
though
he
would
have
willingly
dispensed
with
my
assistance
in
the
matter
i
then
told
him
you
had
gone
to
bed
and
he
locked
the
door
as
usual
and
went
away
after
shaking
me
by
the
hand
after
he
had
gone
i
went
to
bed
next
morning
the
worthy
man
was
at
his
post
by
nine
and
at
ten
the
three
officers
came
and
on
my
telling
them
that
you
were
still
asleep
they
went
away
bidding
me
come
to
a
and
summon
them
when
you
got
up
as
they
waited
and
waited
to
no
purpose
they
came
again
at
noon
and
told
the
soldier
to
open
the
door
what
followed
amused
me
though
i
was
in
some
danger
in
the
midst
of
the
rascals
they
went
in
and
taking
the
for
your
head
they
came
up
to
the
bed
and
politely
wished
you
good
morning
you
took
no
notice
so
one
of
them
proceeded
to
give
you
a
gentle
shake
and
the
bauble
fell
and
rolled
along
the
floor
i
roared
with
laughter
at
the
sight
of
their
amazement
laugh
do
you
rascal
tell
us
where
your
master
is
and
to
give
emphasis
to
their
words
they
accompanied
them
with
some
strokes
of
the
cane
i
was
not
going
to
stand
this
sort
of
thing
so
i
told
them
with
an
oath
that
if
they
did
not
stop
i
should
defend
myself
adding
that
i
was
not
my
master
keeper
and
advising
them
to
ask
the
sentry
the
sentry
on
his
part
swore
by
all
the
saints
that
you
must
have
escaped
by
the
window
but
in
spite
of
this
a
corporal
was
summoned
and
the
poor
man
was
sent
to
prison
the
clamour
that
was
going
on
brought
up
the
landlord
who
opened
your
mails
and
on
finding
them
empty
said
that
he
would
be
well
enough
paid
by
your
postchaise
replying
only
with
a
grin
to
the
officer
who
pretended
you
had
given
it
him
in
the
midst
of
the
tumult
a
superior
officer
came
up
who
decided
that
you
must
have
escaped
through
the
window
and
ordered
the
sentry
to
be
set
at
liberty
on
the
spot
then
came
my
turn
for
as
i
kept
on
laughing
and
answered
all
questions
by
do
know
these
gentleman
had
me
taken
to
prison
telling
me
i
should
stay
there
till
i
informed
them
where
you
or
at
least
your
effects
could
be
found
the
next
day
one
of
them
came
to
the
prison
and
told
me
that
unless
i
confessed
i
should
undoubtedly
be
sent
to
the
galleys
the
faith
of
a
spaniard
i
answered
i
know
nothing
but
if
i
did
it
would
be
all
the
same
to
you
for
no
one
can
make
an
honest
servant
betray
his
master
at
this
the
rascal
told
the
turnkey
to
give
me
a
taste
of
the
lash
and
after
this
had
been
done
i
was
set
at
liberty
my
back
was
somewhat
scarified
but
i
had
the
proud
consciousness
of
having
done
my
duty
and
i
went
back
and
slept
at
the
inn
where
they
were
glad
to
see
me
next
morning
everyone
knew
you
were
here
and
had
sent
a
challenge
to
the
three
sharpers
but
the
universal
opinion
was
that
they
were
too
knowing
to
risk
their
lives
by
meeting
you
nevertheless
madame
baletti
told
me
to
beg
you
to
leave
furstenburg
as
they
might
very
likely
have
you
assassinated
the
landlord
sold
your
chaise
and
your
mails
to
the
austrian
ambassador
who
they
say
let
you
escape
from
a
window
in
the
apartment
occupied
by
his
mistress
no
one
offered
to
prevent
me
coming
here
three
hours
after
le
duc
arrival
i
took
post
and
went
to
schaffhaus
and
from
there
to
zurich
with
hired
horses
as
there
are
no
posts
in
switzerland
at
zurich
i
put
up
at
the
an
excellent
inn
after
supper
powdering
over
my
arrival
in
zurich
where
i
had
dropped
from
the
clouds
as
it
were
i
began
to
reflect
seriously
upon
my
present
situation
and
the
events
of
my
past
life
i
recalled
my
misfortunes
and
scrutinized
my
conduct
and
was
not
long
in
concluding
that
all
i
had
suffered
was
through
my
own
fault
and
that
when
fortune
would
have
crowned
me
with
happiness
i
had
persistently
trifled
that
happiness
away
i
had
just
succeeded
in
escaping
from
a
trap
where
i
might
have
perished
or
at
least
have
been
overwhelmed
with
shame
and
i
shuddered
at
the
thought
i
resolved
to
be
no
more
fortune
plaything
but
to
escape
entirely
from
her
hands
i
calculated
my
assets
and
found
i
was
possessed
of
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
that
said
i
can
live
secure
amidst
the
changes
and
chances
of
this
life
and
i
shall
at
last
experience
true
happiness
i
went
to
bed
pondering
over
these
fancies
and
my
sleep
was
full
of
happy
dreams
i
saw
myself
dwelling
in
a
retired
spot
amidst
peace
and
plenty
i
thought
i
was
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
a
fair
expanse
of
country
which
belonged
to
me
where
i
enjoyed
that
freedom
the
world
can
not
give
my
dreams
had
all
the
force
of
reality
till
a
sudden
awakening
at
came
to
give
them
the
lie
but
the
imaginary
bliss
i
had
enjoyed
had
so
taken
my
fancy
that
i
could
not
rest
till
i
realized
it
i
arose
dressed
myself
hastily
and
went
out
fasting
without
knowing
where
i
was
going
i
walked
on
and
on
absorbed
in
contemplation
and
did
not
really
awake
till
i
found
myself
in
a
ravine
between
two
lofty
mountains
stepping
forward
i
reached
a
valley
surrounded
by
mountains
on
all
sides
and
in
the
distance
a
fine
church
attached
to
a
pile
of
buildings
magnificently
situated
i
guessed
it
to
be
a
monastery
and
i
made
my
way
towards
it
the
church
door
was
open
and
i
went
in
and
was
amazed
at
the
rich
marbles
and
the
beauty
of
the
altars
and
after
hearing
the
last
mass
i
went
to
the
sacristy
and
found
myself
in
a
crowd
of
benedictines
the
abbot
whom
i
recognized
by
his
cross
came
towards
me
and
asked
if
i
wished
to
see
the
church
and
monastery
i
replied
that
i
should
be
delighted
and
he
with
two
other
brethren
offered
to
shew
me
all
i
saw
their
rich
ornaments
chasubles
embroidered
with
gold
and
pearls
the
sacred
vessels
adorned
with
diamonds
and
other
precious
stones
a
rich
balustrade
etc
as
i
understood
german
very
imperfectly
and
the
swiss
dialect
which
is
hard
to
acquire
and
bears
the
same
relation
to
german
that
genoese
has
to
italian
not
at
all
i
began
to
speak
latin
and
asked
the
abbot
if
the
church
had
been
built
for
long
thereupon
the
very
reverend
father
entered
into
a
long
history
which
would
have
made
me
repent
my
inquisitiveness
if
he
had
not
finished
by
saying
that
the
church
was
consecrated
by
jesus
christ
himself
this
was
carrying
its
foundation
rather
far
back
and
no
doubt
my
face
expressed
some
surprise
for
to
convince
me
of
the
truth
of
the
story
the
abbot
bade
me
follow
him
into
the
church
and
there
on
a
piece
of
marble
pavement
he
shewed
me
the
imprint
of
the
foot
of
jesus
which
he
had
left
there
at
the
moment
of
the
consecration
to
convince
the
infidels
and
to
save
the
bishop
the
trouble
of
consecrating
the
church
the
abbot
had
had
this
divinely
revealed
to
him
in
a
dream
and
going
into
the
church
to
verify
the
vision
he
saw
the
print
of
the
divine
foot
and
gave
thanks
to
the
lord
