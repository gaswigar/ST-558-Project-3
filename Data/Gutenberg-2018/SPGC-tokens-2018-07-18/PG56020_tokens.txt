the
power
of
truth
truth
is
the
rock
foundation
of
every
great
character
it
is
loyalty
to
the
right
as
we
see
it
it
is
courageous
living
of
our
lives
in
harmony
with
our
ideals
it
is
truth
ever
defies
full
definition
like
electricity
it
can
only
be
explained
by
noting
its
manifestation
it
is
the
compass
of
the
soul
the
guardian
of
conscience
the
final
touchstone
of
right
truth
is
the
revelation
of
the
ideal
but
it
is
also
an
inspiration
to
realize
that
ideal
a
constant
impulse
to
live
it
lying
is
one
of
the
oldest
vices
in
the
made
its
début
in
the
first
recorded
conversation
in
history
in
a
famous
interview
in
the
garden
of
eden
lying
is
the
sacrifice
of
honor
to
create
a
wrong
impression
it
is
masquerading
in
misfit
virtues
truth
can
stand
alone
for
it
needs
no
chaperone
or
escort
lies
are
cowardly
fearsome
things
that
must
travel
in
battalions
they
are
like
a
lot
of
drunken
men
one
vainly
seeking
to
support
another
lying
is
the
partner
and
accomplice
of
all
the
other
vices
it
is
the
cancer
of
moral
degeneracy
in
an
individual
life
truth
is
the
oldest
of
all
the
virtues
it
antedated
man
it
lived
before
there
was
man
to
perceive
it
or
to
accept
it
it
is
the
unchangeable
the
constant
law
is
the
eternal
truth
of
unity
that
always
produces
identical
results
under
identical
conditions
when
a
man
discovers
a
great
truth
in
nature
he
has
the
key
to
the
understanding
of
a
million
phenomena
when
he
grasps
a
great
truth
in
morals
he
has
in
it
the
key
to
his
spiritual
for
the
individual
there
is
no
such
thing
as
theoretic
truth
a
great
truth
that
is
not
absorbed
by
our
whole
mind
and
life
and
has
not
become
an
inseparable
part
of
our
living
is
not
a
real
truth
to
us
if
we
know
the
truth
and
do
not
live
it
our
life
lie
in
speech
the
man
who
makes
truth
his
watchword
is
careful
in
his
words
he
seeks
to
be
accurate
neither
understating
nor
he
never
states
as
a
fact
that
of
which
he
is
not
sure
what
he
says
has
the
ring
of
sincerity
the
hallmark
of
pure
gold
if
he
praises
you
you
accept
his
statement
as
net
you
do
not
have
to
work
out
a
problem
in
mental
arithmetic
on
the
side
to
see
what
discount
you
ought
to
make
before
you
accept
his
judgment
his
promise
counts
for
something
you
accept
it
as
being
as
good
as
his
bond
you
know
that
no
matter
how
much
it
may
cost
him
to
verify
and
fulfil
his
word
by
his
deed
he
will
do
it
his
honesty
is
not
policy
the
man
who
is
honest
merely
because
it
is
the
best
policy
is
not
really
honest
he
is
only
politic
usually
such
a
man
would
forsake
his
seeming
loyalty
to
truth
and
would
work
overtime
for
the
he
could
get
better
terms
truth
means
that
which
one
troweth
or
believes
it
is
living
simply
and
squarely
by
our
belief
it
is
the
externalizing
of
a
faith
in
a
series
of
actions
truth
is
ever
strong
courageous
virile
though
kindly
gentle
calm
and
restful
there
is
a
vital
difference
between
error
and
untruthfulness
a
man
may
be
in
error
and
yet
live
bravely
by
it
he
who
is
untruthful
in
his
life
knows
the
truth
but
denies
it
the
one
is
loyal
to
what
he
believes
the
other
is
traitor
to
what
he
knows
what
is
truth
pilate
great
question
asked
of
christ
nearly
two
thousand
years
ago
has
echoed
unanswered
through
the
ages
we
get
constant
revelations
of
parts
of
it
glimpses
of
constantly
new
phases
but
never
complete
final
definition
if
we
but
live
up
to
the
truth
that
we
know
and
seek
ever
to
know
more
we
have
put
ourselves
into
the
spiritual
attitude
of
receptiveness
to
know
truth
in
the
fullness
of
its
power
truth
is
the
sun
of
morality
and
like
that
lesser
sun
in
the
heavens
we
can
walk
by
its
light
live
in
its
warmth
and
life
even
if
we
see
but
a
small
part
of
it
and
receive
but
a
microscopic
fraction
of
its
rays
which
of
the
great
religions
of
the
world
is
the
real
the
final
the
absolute
truth
we
must
make
our
individual
choice
and
live
by
it
as
best
we
can
every
new
sect
every
new
cult
has
in
it
a
grain
of
truth
at
least
it
is
this
that
attracts
attention
and
wins
adherents
this
mustard
seed
of
truth
is
often
overestimated
darkening
the
eyes
of
man
to
the
untrue
parts
or
phases
of
the
varying
religious
faiths
but
in
exact
proportion
to
the
basic
truth
they
contain
do
religions
last
become
permanent
and
growing
and
satisfy
and
inspire
the
hearts
of
men
mushrooms
of
error
have
a
quick
growth
but
they
exhaust
their
vitality
and
die
while
truth
still
lives
the
man
who
makes
the
acquisition
of
wealth
the
goal
and
ultimatum
of
his
life
seeing
it
as
an
end
rather
than
a
means
to
an
end
is
not
true
why
does
the
world
usually
make
wealth
the
criterion
of
success
and
riches
the
synonym
of
attainment
real
success
in
life
means
the
individual
conquest
of
himself
it
means
how
he
has
bettered
himself
not
how
he
has
bettered
his
fortune
the
great
question
of
life
is
not
what
have
i
but
what
am
i
man
is
usually
loyal
to
what
he
most
desires
the
man
who
lies
to
save
a
nickel
merely
proclaims
that
he
esteems
a
nickel
more
than
he
does
his
honor
he
who
sacrifices
his
ideals
truth
and
character
for
mere
money
or
position
is
weighing
his
conscience
in
one
pan
of
a
scale
against
a
bag
of
gold
in
the
other
he
is
loyal
to
what
he
finds
the
heavier
that
which
he
desires
the
money
but
this
is
not
truth
truth
is
the
heart
loyalty
to
abstract
right
made
manifest
in
concrete
instances
the
tradesman
who
lies
cheats
misleads
and
overcharges
and
then
seeks
to
square
himself
with
his
anæmic
conscience
by
saying
lying
is
absolutely
necessary
to
business
is
as
untrue
in
his
statement
as
he
is
in
his
acts
he
justifies
himself
with
the
petty
defence
as
the
thief
who
says
it
is
necessary
to
steal
in
order
to
live
the
permanent
business
prosperity
of
an
individual
a
city
or
a
nation
rests
finally
on
commercial
integrity
alone
despite
all
that
the
cynics
may
say
or
all
the
exceptions
whose
temporary
success
may
mislead
them
it
is
truth
alone
that
lasts
the
politician
who
is
vacillating
temporizing
shifting
constantly
trimming
his
sails
to
catch
every
puff
of
wind
of
popularity
is
a
trickster
who
succeeds
only
until
he
is
found
out
a
lie
may
live
for
a
time
truth
for
all
time
a
lie
never
lives
by
its
own
vitality
it
merely
continues
to
exist
because
it
simulates
truth
when
it
is
unmasked
it
dies
when
each
of
four
newspapers
in
one
city
puts
forth
the
claim
that
its
circulation
is
larger
than
all
the
others
combined
there
must
be
an
error
somewhere
where
there
is
untruth
there
is
always
conflict
discrepancy
impossibility
if
all
the
truths
of
life
and
experience
from
the
first
second
of
time
or
for
any
section
of
eternity
were
brought
together
there
would
be
perfect
harmony
perfect
accord
union
and
unity
but
if
two
lies
come
together
they
quarrel
and
seek
to
destroy
each
other
it
is
in
the
trifles
of
daily
life
that
truth
should
be
our
constant
guide
and
inspiration
truth
is
not
a
consecrated
to
special
occasions
it
is
the
strong
durable
homespun
for
daily
living
the
man
who
forgets
his
promises
is
untrue
we
rarely
lose
sight
of
those
promises
made
to
us
for
our
individual
benefit
these
we
regard
as
checks
we
always
seek
to
cash
at
the
earliest
moment
the
miser
never
forgets
where
he
hides
his
treasure
says
one
of
the
old
philosophers
let
us
cultivate
that
sterling
honor
that
holds
our
word
so
supreme
so
sacred
that
to
forget
it
would
seem
a
crime
to
deny
it
would
be
impossible
the
man
who
says
pleasant
things
and
makes
promises
which
to
him
are
light
as
air
but
to
someone
else
seem
the
rock
upon
which
a
life
hope
is
built
is
cruelly
untrue
he
who
does
not
regard
his
appointments
carelessly
breaking
them
or
ignoring
them
is
the
thoughtless
thief
of
another
time
it
reveals
selfishness
carelessness
and
lax
business
morals
it
is
untrue
to
the
simplest
justice
of
life
men
who
split
hairs
with
their
conscience
who
mislead
others
by
deft
shrewd
phrasing
which
may
be
true
in
letter
yet
lying
in
spirit
and
designedly
uttered
to
produce
a
false
impression
are
untruthful
in
the
most
cowardly
way
such
men
would
cheat
even
in
solitaire
like
murderers
they
forgive
themselves
their
crime
in
congratulating
themselves
on
the
cleverness
of
their
alibi
the
parent
who
preaches
honor
to
his
child
and
gives
false
statistics
about
the
child
age
to
the
conductor
to
save
a
nickel
is
not
true
the
man
who
keeps
his
religion
in
camphor
all
week
and
who
takes
it
out
only
on
sunday
is
not
true
he
who
seeks
to
get
the
highest
wages
for
the
least
possible
amount
of
service
is
not
true
the
man
who
has
to
sing
lullabies
to
his
conscience
before
he
himself
can
sleep
is
not
true
truth
is
the
straight
line
in
morals
it
is
the
shortest
distance
between
a
fact
and
the
expression
of
it
the
foundations
of
truth
should
ever
be
laid
in
childhood
it
is
then
that
parents
should
instil
into
the
young
mind
the
instant
automatic
turning
to
truth
making
it
the
constant
atmosphere
of
the
mind
and
life
let
the
child
know
that
truth
above
all
things
should
be
the
motto
of
its
life
parents
make
a
great
mistake
when
they
look
upon
a
lie
as
a
disease
in
morals
it
is
not
always
a
disease
in
itself
it
is
but
a
symptom
behind
every
untruth
is
some
reason
some
cause
and
it
is
this
cause
that
should
be
removed
the
lie
may
be
the
result
of
fear
the
attempt
to
cover
a
fault
and
to
escape
punishment
it
may
be
merely
the
evidence
of
an
imagination
it
may
reveal
maliciousness
or
obstinacy
it
may
be
the
hunger
for
praise
that
leads
the
child
to
win
attention
and
to
startle
others
by
wonderful
stories
it
may
be
merely
carelessness
in
speech
the
reckless
use
of
words
it
may
be
acquisitiveness
that
makes
lying
the
handmaid
of
theft
but
if
in
the
life
of
the
child
or
the
adult
the
symptom
be
made
to
reveal
the
disease
and
that
be
then
treated
truth
reasserts
itself
and
the
moral
health
is
restored
constantly
telling
a
child
not
to
lie
is
giving
life
and
intensity
to
the
lie
the
true
method
is
to
quicken
the
moral
muscles
from
the
positive
side
urge
the
child
to
be
honest
to
be
faithful
to
be
loyal
to
be
fearless
to
the
truth
tell
him
ever
of
the
nobility
of
courage
to
speak
the
true
to
live
the
right
to
hold
fast
to
principles
of
honor
in
every
he
need
never
fear
to
face
any
of
life
crises
the
parent
must
live
truth
or
the
child
will
not
live
it
the
child
will
startle
you
with
its
quickness
in
puncturing
the
bubble
of
your
pretended
knowledge
in
instinctively
piercing
the
heart
of
a
sophistry
without
being
conscious
of
process
in
relentlessly
enumerating
your
unfulfilled
promises
in
detecting
with
the
justice
of
a
court
of
equity
a
technicality
of
speech
that
is
virtually
a
lie
he
will
justify
his
own
lapses
from
truth
by
appeal
to
some
white
lie
told
to
a
visitor
and
unknown
to
be
overheard
by
the
little
one
whose
mental
powers
we
ever
underestimate
in
theory
though
we
may
overpraise
in
words
teach
the
child
in
a
thousand
ways
directly
and
indirectly
the
power
of
truth
the
beauty
of
truth
and
the
sweetness
and
rest
of
companionship
with
truth
and
if
it
be
the
of
the
child
character
as
a
fact
not
as
a
theory
the
future
of
that
child
is
as
fully
assured
as
it
is
possible
for
human
prevision
to
guarantee
the
power
of
truth
in
its
highest
purest
and
most
exalted
phases
stands
squarely
on
four
basic
lines
of
relation
love
of
truth
the
search
for
truth
faith
in
truth
and
work
for
truth
the
love
of
truth
is
the
cultivated
hunger
for
it
in
itself
and
for
itself
without
any
thought
of
what
it
may
cost
what
sacrifices
it
may
entail
what
theories
or
beliefs
of
a
lifetime
may
be
laid
desolate
in
its
supreme
phase
this
attitude
of
life
is
rare
but
unless
one
can
to
put
himself
into
harmony
with
this
view
the
individual
will
only
creep
in
truth
when
he
might
walk
bravely
with
the
love
of
truth
the
individual
scorns
to
do
a
mean
thing
no
matter
what
be
the
gain
even
if
the
whole
world
would
approve
he
would
not
sacrifice
the
sanction
of
his
own
high
standard
for
any
gain
he
would
not
willingly
deflect
the
needle
of
his
thought
and
act
from
the
true
north
as
he
knows
it
by
the
slightest
possible
variation
he
himself
would
know
of
the
would
be
enough
what
matters
it
what
the
world
thinks
if
he
have
his
own
disapproval
the
man
who
has
a
certain
religious
belief
and
fears
to
discuss
it
lest
it
may
be
proved
wrong
is
not
loyal
to
his
belief
he
has
but
a
coward
faithfulness
to
his
prejudices
if
he
were
a
lover
of
truth
he
would
be
willing
at
any
moment
to
surrender
his
belief
for
a
higher
better
and
truer
faith
the
man
who
votes
the
same
ticket
in
politics
year
after
year
without
caring
for
issues
men
or
problems
merely
voting
in
a
certain
way
because
he
always
has
voted
so
is
sacrificing
loyalty
to
truth
to
a
weak
mistaken
stubborn
attachment
to
a
precedent
such
a
man
should
stay
in
his
cradle
all
his
he
spent
his
early
years
there
the
search
for
truth
means
that
the
individual
must
not
merely
follow
truth
as
he
sees
it
but
he
must
so
far
as
he
can
search
to
see
that
he
is
right
when
the
kearsarge
was
wrecked
on
the
roncador
reef
the
captain
was
sailing
correctly
by
his
chart
but
his
map
was
an
old
one
the
sunken
reef
was
not
marked
down
loyalty
to
standards
means
stagnation
in
china
they
plow
but
they
plow
with
the
instrument
of
four
thousand
years
ago
the
search
for
truth
is
the
angel
of
civilization
and
in
morals
while
it
makes
us
bold
and
aggressive
in
our
own
life
it
teaches
us
to
be
tender
and
sympathetic
with
others
their
life
may
represent
a
station
we
have
passed
in
our
progress
or
one
we
must
seek
to
reach
we
can
then
congratulate
ourselves
without
condemning
them
all
the
truths
of
the
world
are
not
concentrated
in
our
creed
all
the
sunshine
of
the
world
is
not
focused
on
our
doorstep
we
should
ever
speak
the
truth
only
in
love
and
kindness
truth
should
ever
extend
the
hand
of
love
never
the
hand
clenching
a
bludgeon
faith
in
truth
is
an
essential
to
perfect
companionship
with
truth
the
individual
must
have
perfect
confidence
and
assurance
of
the
final
triumph
of
right
and
order
and
justice
and
believe
that
all
things
are
evolving
toward
that
divine
consummation
no
matter
how
dark
and
dreary
life
may
seem
from
day
to
day
no
real
success
no
lasting
happiness
can
exist
except
it
be
founded
on
the
rock
of
truth
the
prosperity
that
is
based
on
lying
deception
and
intrigue
is
only
can
not
last
any
more
than
a
mushroom
can
outlive
an
oak
like
the
blind
samson
struggling
in
the
temple
the
individual
whose
life
is
based
on
trickery
always
pulls
down
the
supporting
columns
of
his
own
edifice
and
perishes
in
the
ruins
no
matter
what
price
a
man
may
pay
for
truth
he
is
getting
it
at
a
bargain
the
lying
of
others
can
never
hurt
us
long
it
always
carries
with
it
our
exoneration
in
the
end
during
the
siege
of
sebastopol
the
russian
shells
that
threatened
to
destroy
a
fort
opened
a
hidden
spring
of
water
in
the
hillside
and
saved
the
thirsting
people
they
sought
to
kill
work
for
the
interests
and
advancement
of
truth
is
a
necessary
part
of
real
companionship
if
a
man
has
a
love
of
truth
if
he
searches
to
find
it
and
has
faith
in
it
even
when
he
can
not
find
it
will
he
not
work
to
spread
it
the
strongest
way
for
man
to
strengthen
the
power
of
truth
in
the
world
is
to
live
it
himself
in
every
detail
of
thought
word
and
make
himself
a
sun
of
personal
radiation
of
truth
and
to
let
his
silent
influence
speak
for
it
and
his
direct
acts
glorify
it
so
far
as
he
can
in
his
sphere
of
life
and
action
let
him
first
seek
to
before
he
seeks
to
teach
or
to
do
in
any
line
of
moral
growth
let
man
realize
that
truth
is
essentially
an
virtue
in
his
relation
to
himself
even
if
there
were
no
other
human
being
living
it
becomes
as
he
radiates
it
in
his
daily
life
truth
is
first
intellectual
craving
to
know
the
right
second
it
is
moral
honesty
the
hunger
to
live
the
right
truth
is
not
a
mere
absence
of
the
vices
this
is
only
a
moral
vacuum
truth
is
the
living
pulsing
breathing
of
the
virtues
of
life
mere
refraining
from
is
but
keeping
the
weeds
out
of
the
garden
of
one
life
but
this
must
be
followed
by
positive
planting
of
the
seeds
of
right
to
secure
the
flowers
of
true
living
to
the
negatives
of
the
ten
commandments
must
be
added
the
positives
of
the
beatitudes
the
one
condemns
the
other
commends
the
one
forbids
the
other
inspires
the
one
emphasizes
the
act
the
other
the
spirit
behind
the
act
the
whole
truth
rests
not
in
either
but
in
both
a
man
can
not
truly
believe
in
god
without
believing
in
the
final
inevitable
triumph
of
truth
if
you
have
truth
on
your
side
you
can
pass
through
the
dark
valley
of
slander
misrepresentation
and
abuse
undaunted
as
though
you
wore
a
magic
suit
of
mail
that
no
bullet
could
enter
no
arrow
could
pierce
you
can
hold
your
head
high
toss
it
fearlessly
and
defiantly
look
every
man
calmly
and
unflinchingly
in
the
eye
as
though
you
rode
a
victorious
king
returning
at
the
head
of
your
legions
with
banners
waving
and
lances
glistening
and
bugles
filling
the
air
with
music
you
can
feel
the
great
expansive
wave
of
moral
health
surging
through
you
as
the
quickened
blood
courses
through
the
body
of
him
who
is
gladly
gloriously
proud
of
physical
health
you
will
know
that
all
will
come
right
in
the
end
that
it
come
that
error
must
flee
before
the
great
white
light
of
truth
as
darkness
slinks
away
into
nothingness
in
the
presence
of
the
sunburst
then
with
truth
as
your
guide
your
companion
your
ally
and
inspiration
you
tingle
with
the
consciousness
of
your
kinship
with
the
infinite
and
all
the
petty
trials
sorrows
and
sufferings
of
life
fade
away
like
temporary
harmless
visions
seen
in
a
dream
the
courage
to
face
ingratitude
the
courage
to
face
ingratitude
ingratitude
the
most
popular
sin
of
humanity
is
forgetfulness
of
the
heart
it
is
the
revelation
of
the
emptiness
of
pretended
loyalty
the
individual
who
possesses
it
finds
it
the
shortest
cut
to
all
the
other
vices
ingratitude
is
a
crime
more
despicable
than
revenge
which
is
only
returning
evil
for
evil
while
ingratitude
returns
evil
for
good
people
who
are
ungrateful
rarely
forgive
you
if
you
do
them
a
good
turn
their
microscopic
hearts
resent
the
humiliation
of
having
been
helped
by
a
superior
and
this
rankling
feeling
filtering
through
their
petty
natures
often
ends
in
hate
and
treachery
gratitude
is
thankfulness
expressed
in
action
it
is
the
instinctive
radiation
of
justice
giving
new
life
and
energy
to
the
individual
from
whom
it
emanates
it
is
the
heart
recognition
of
kindness
that
the
lips
can
not
repay
gratitude
never
counts
its
payments
it
realizes
that
no
debt
of
kindness
can
ever
be
outlawed
ever
be
cancelled
ever
paid
in
full
gratitude
ever
feels
the
insignificance
of
its
instalments
ingratitude
the
nothingness
of
the
debt
gratitude
is
the
flowering
of
a
seed
of
kindness
ingratitude
is
the
dead
inactivity
of
a
seed
dropped
on
a
stone
the
expectation
of
gratitude
is
human
the
rising
superior
to
ingratitude
is
almost
divine
to
desire
recognition
of
our
acts
of
kindness
and
to
hunger
for
appreciation
and
the
simple
justice
of
a
return
of
good
for
good
is
natural
but
man
never
rises
to
the
dignity
of
true
living
until
he
has
the
courage
that
dares
to
face
ingratitude
calmly
and
to
pursue
his
course
unchanged
when
his
good
works
meet
with
thanklessness
or
disdain
man
should
have
only
one
court
of
appeals
as
to
his
actions
not
what
will
be
the
result
how
will
it
be
received
but
is
it
right
then
he
should
live
his
life
in
harmony
with
this
standard
alone
serenely
bravely
loyally
and
unfalteringly
making
right
for
right
sake
both
his
ideal
and
his
inspiration
man
should
not
be
an
automatic
cleverly
contrived
to
release
a
given
quantity
of
illumination
under
the
stimulus
of
a
nickel
he
should
be
like
the
great
sun
itself
which
ever
radiates
light
warmth
life
and
power
because
it
can
not
help
doing
so
because
these
qualities
fill
the
heart
of
the
sun
and
for
it
to
have
them
means
that
it
must
give
them
constantly
let
the
sunlight
of
our
sympathy
tenderness
love
appreciation
influence
and
kindness
ever
go
out
from
us
as
a
glow
to
brighten
and
hearten
others
but
do
not
let
us
ever
spoil
it
all
by
going
through
life
constantly
collecting
receipts
as
vouchers
to
stick
on
the
file
of
our
it
is
hard
to
see
those
who
have
sat
at
our
board
in
the
days
of
our
prosperity
flee
as
from
a
pestilence
when
misfortune
darkens
our
doorway
to
see
the
loyalty
upon
which
we
would
have
staked
our
life
that
seemed
firm
as
a
rock
crack
and
splinter
like
thin
glass
at
the
first
real
test
to
know
that
the
fire
of
friendship
at
which
we
could
ever
warm
our
hands
in
our
hour
of
need
has
turned
to
cold
dead
gray
ashes
where
warmth
is
but
a
haunting
memory
to
realize
that
he
who
once
lived
in
the
sanctuary
of
our
affection
in
the
frank
confidence
where
conversation
seemed
but
our
soliloquy
and
to
whom
our
aims
and
aspirations
have
been
thrown
open
with
no
bluebeard
chamber
of
reserve
has
been
secretly
poisoning
the
waters
of
our
reputation
and
undermining
us
by
his
lies
and
treachery
is
hard
indeed
but
no
matter
how
the
ingratitude
stings
us
we
should
just
swallow
the
sob
stifle
the
tear
smile
serenely
and
bravely
to
forget
in
justice
to
ourselves
we
should
not
permit
the
ingratitude
of
a
few
to
make
us
condemn
the
whole
world
we
pay
too
much
tribute
to
a
few
human
insects
when
we
let
their
paralyze
our
faith
in
humanity
it
is
a
lie
of
the
cynics
that
says
men
are
ungrateful
a
companion
lie
to
men
have
their
price
we
must
trust
humanity
if
we
would
get
good
from
humanity
he
who
thinks
all
mankind
is
vile
is
a
pessimist
who
mistakes
his
introspection
for
observation
he
looks
into
his
own
heart
and
thinks
he
sees
the
world
he
is
like
a
man
who
never
sees
what
he
seems
to
be
looking
at
confidence
and
credit
are
the
cornerstones
of
business
as
they
are
of
society
withdraw
them
from
business
and
the
activities
and
enterprises
of
the
world
would
stop
in
an
instant
topple
and
fall
into
chaos
withdraw
confidence
in
humanity
from
the
individual
and
he
becomes
but
a
breathing
selfish
egotist
the
one
good
man
left
working
overtime
in
nursing
his
petty
grudge
against
the
world
because
a
few
whom
he
has
favored
have
been
ungrateful
if
a
man
receives
a
counterfeit
dollar
he
does
not
straightway
lose
his
faith
in
all
money
least
there
are
no
such
instances
on
record
in
this
country
if
he
has
a
run
of
three
or
four
days
of
dull
weather
he
does
not
say
the
sun
ceases
to
exist
there
are
surely
no
bright
days
to
come
in
the
whole
calendar
of
time
if
a
man
breakfast
is
rendered
an
unpleasant
memory
by
some
item
of
food
that
has
outlived
its
usefulness
he
does
not
forswear
eating
if
a
man
finds
under
a
tree
an
apple
with
a
suspicious
looking
hole
on
one
side
he
does
not
condemn
the
whole
orchard
he
simply
confines
his
criticism
to
that
apple
but
he
who
has
helped
some
one
who
later
did
not
pass
a
good
examination
on
gratitude
says
in
a
voice
plaintive
with
the
consciousness
of
injury
and
with
a
nod
of
his
head
that
implies
the
wisdom
of
solomon
i
have
had
my
experience
i
have
learned
my
lesson
this
is
the
last
time
i
will
have
faith
in
any
man
i
did
this
for
him
and
that
for
him
and
now
look
at
the
result
then
he
unrolls
a
long
schedule
of
favors
carefully
itemized
and
added
up
till
it
seems
the
of
a
great
city
he
complains
of
the
injustice
of
one
man
yet
he
is
willing
to
be
unjust
to
the
whole
world
making
it
bear
the
punishment
of
the
wrong
of
an
individual
there
is
too
much
vicarious
suffering
already
in
this
earth
of
ours
without
this
lilliputian
attempt
to
extend
it
by
syndicating
one
ingratitude
if
one
man
drinks
to
excess
it
is
not
absolute
justice
to
send
the
whole
world
to
jail
the
farmer
does
not
expect
every
seed
that
he
sows
in
hope
and
faith
to
fall
on
good
ground
and
bring
forth
its
harvest
he
is
perfectly
certain
that
this
will
not
be
so
can
not
be
he
is
counting
on
the
final
outcome
of
many
seeds
on
the
harvest
of
all
rather
than
on
the
harvest
of
one
if
you
really
want
gratitude
and
must
have
it
be
willing
to
make
many
men
your
debtors
the
more
unselfish
charitable
and
exalted
the
life
and
mission
of
the
individual
the
larger
will
be
the
number
of
instances
of
ingratitude
that
must
be
met
and
vanquished
the
thirty
years
of
christ
life
was
a
tragedy
of
ingratitudes
ingratitude
is
manifest
in
three
degrees
of
intensity
in
the
knew
them
all
in
numberless
bitter
instances
the
first
phase
the
simplest
and
most
common
is
that
of
thoughtless
thanklessness
as
was
shown
in
the
case
of
the
ten
lepers
healed
in
one
departed
without
a
word
only
gave
thanks
the
second
phase
of
ingratitude
is
denial
a
positive
sin
not
the
mere
negation
of
thanklessness
this
was
exemplified
in
peter
whose
selfish
desire
to
stand
well
with
two
maids
and
some
bystanders
in
the
hour
when
he
had
the
opportunity
to
be
loyal
to
christ
forgot
his
friendship
lost
all
thought
of
his
indebtedness
to
his
master
and
denied
him
not
once
or
twice
but
three
times
the
third
phase
of
ingratitude
is
treachery
where
selfishness
grows
vindictive
as
shown
by
judas
the
honored
treasurer
of
the
little
band
of
thirteen
whose
jealousy
ingratitude
and
thirty
pieces
of
silver
made
possible
the
tragedy
of
calvary
these
denial
and
the
gamut
of
ingratitude
and
the
first
leads
to
the
second
and
the
second
prepares
the
way
for
the
third
we
must
ever
tower
high
above
dependence
on
human
gratitude
or
we
can
do
nothing
really
great
nothing
truly
noble
the
expectation
of
gratitude
is
the
alloy
of
an
otherwise
virtuous
act
it
ever
dulls
the
edge
of
even
our
best
actions
most
persons
look
at
gratitude
as
a
protective
tariff
on
virtues
the
man
who
is
weakened
in
by
the
ingratitude
of
others
is
serving
god
on
a
salary
basis
he
is
a
hired
soldier
not
a
volunteer
he
should
be
honest
enough
to
see
that
he
is
working
for
a
reward
like
a
child
he
is
being
good
for
a
bonus
he
is
really
regarding
his
kindness
and
his
other
expressions
of
goodness
as
moral
stock
he
is
willing
to
hold
only
so
long
as
they
pay
dividends
there
is
in
such
living
always
a
touch
of
the
pose
it
is
waiting
for
the
applause
of
the
gallery
we
must
let
the
consciousness
of
doing
right
of
living
up
to
our
ideals
be
our
reward
and
stimulus
or
life
will
become
to
us
but
a
series
of
failures
sorrows
and
disappointments
much
of
the
seeming
ingratitude
in
life
comes
from
our
magnifying
of
our
own
acts
our
minifying
of
the
acts
of
others
we
may
have
overestimated
the
importance
of
something
that
we
have
done
it
may
have
been
most
trivial
purely
incidental
yet
the
marvellous
working
of
the
loom
of
time
brought
out
great
and
unexpected
results
to
the
recipient
of
our
favor
we
often
feel
that
wondrous
gratitude
is
due
us
though
we
were
in
no
wise
the
inspiration
of
the
success
we
survey
with
such
a
feeling
of
pride
a
chance
introduction
given
by
us
on
the
street
may
through
an
infinity
of
circumstances
make
our
friend
a
millionaire
thanks
may
be
due
us
for
the
introduction
and
perhaps
not
even
that
for
it
might
have
been
unavoidable
but
surely
we
err
when
we
expect
him
to
be
meekly
grateful
to
us
for
his
subsequent
millions
the
essence
of
truest
kindness
lies
in
the
grace
with
which
it
is
performed
some
men
seem
to
discount
all
gratitude
almost
make
it
impossible
by
the
way
in
which
they
grant
favors
they
make
you
feel
so
small
so
mean
so
inferior
your
cheeks
burn
with
indignation
in
the
acceptance
of
the
boon
you
seek
at
their
hands
you
feel
it
is
like
a
bone
thrown
at
a
dog
instead
of
the
quick
sympathetic
graciousness
that
forestalls
your
explanations
and
waives
your
thanks
with
a
smile
the
pleasure
of
one
friend
who
has
been
favored
with
the
opportunity
to
be
of
service
to
another
the
man
who
makes
another
feel
like
an
insect
reclining
on
a
stove
while
he
is
receiving
a
favor
has
no
right
to
expect
future
gratitude
should
feel
satisfied
if
he
receives
forgiveness
let
us
forget
the
good
deeds
we
have
done
by
making
them
seem
small
in
comparison
with
the
greater
things
we
are
doing
and
the
still
greater
acts
we
hope
to
do
this
is
true
generosity
and
will
develop
gratitude
in
the
soul
of
him
who
has
been
helped
unless
he
is
so
petrified
in
selfishness
as
to
make
it
impossible
but
constantly
reminding
a
man
of
the
favors
he
has
received
from
you
almost
cancels
the
debt
the
care
of
the
statistics
should
be
his
privilege
you
are
usurping
his
prerogative
when
you
recall
them
merely
because
it
has
been
our
good
fortune
to
be
able
to
serve
some
one
we
should
not
act
as
if
we
held
a
mortgage
on
his
immortality
and
expect
him
to
swing
the
censor
of
adulation
forever
in
our
presence
that
which
often
seems
to
us
to
be
ingratitude
may
be
merely
our
own
ignorance
of
the
subtle
phases
of
human
nature
sometimes
a
heart
is
so
full
of
thankfulness
that
he
can
not
speak
and
in
the
very
intensity
of
his
appreciation
mere
words
seem
to
him
paltry
petty
and
inadequate
and
the
depth
of
the
eloquence
of
his
silence
is
misunderstood
sometimes
the
consciousness
of
his
inability
to
repay
develops
a
strange
gratitude
it
may
be
though
unwise
in
its
lack
of
determination
to
say
nothing
until
the
opportunity
for
which
he
is
waiting
to
enable
him
to
make
his
gratitude
an
actuality
there
are
countless
instances
in
which
true
gratitude
has
all
the
semblance
of
the
basest
ingratitude
as
certain
harmless
plants
are
made
by
nature
to
resemble
ingratitude
is
some
one
protest
that
you
are
no
longer
necessary
to
him
it
is
often
the
expression
of
rebellion
at
the
discontinuance
of
favors
people
are
rarely
ungrateful
until
they
have
exhausted
their
assessments
profuse
expressions
of
gratitude
do
not
cancel
an
indebtedness
any
more
than
a
promissory
note
settles
an
account
it
is
a
beginning
not
a
finality
gratitude
that
is
extravagant
in
words
is
usually
economical
in
all
other
expression
no
good
act
performed
in
the
world
ever
dies
science
tells
us
that
no
atom
of
matter
can
ever
be
destroyed
that
no
force
once
started
ever
ends
it
merely
passes
through
a
multiplicity
of
phases
every
good
deed
done
to
others
is
a
great
force
that
starts
an
unending
pulsation
through
time
and
eternity
we
may
not
know
it
we
may
never
hear
a
word
of
gratitude
or
of
recognition
but
it
will
all
come
back
to
us
in
some
form
as
naturally
as
perfectly
as
inevitably
as
echo
answers
to
sound
perhaps
not
as
we
expect
it
how
we
expect
it
nor
where
but
sometime
somehow
somewhere
it
comes
back
as
the
dove
that
noah
sent
from
the
ark
returned
with
its
green
leaf
of
revelation
let
us
conceive
of
gratitude
in
its
largest
most
beautiful
sense
that
if
we
receive
any
kindness
we
are
debtor
not
merely
to
one
man
but
to
the
whole
world
as
we
are
each
day
indebted
to
thousands
for
the
comforts
joys
consolations
and
blessings
of
life
let
us
realize
that
it
is
only
by
kindness
to
all
that
we
can
begin
to
repay
the
debt
to
one
begin
to
make
gratitude
the
atmosphere
of
all
our
living
and
a
constant
expression
in
outward
acts
rather
than
in
mere
thoughts
let
us
see
the
awful
cowardice
and
the
injustice
of
ingratitude
not
to
take
it
too
seriously
in
others
not
to
condemn
it
too
severely
but
merely
to
banish
it
forever
from
our
own
lives
and
to
make
every
hour
of
our
living
the
radiation
of
the
sweetness
of
gratitude

it

a
right

with
the
thought
of
the
brightness
of
home
to
quicken

and
to
make

should
never
really
worry
about

think
little
of
it
except
for
inspiration
to
determine
his
course
as
mariners
study
the
stars
to
make

plans
wisely

to
prepare
for

making

the
best
and
truest
that

five
words
up
to
your
this
is
the
magic
formula
that
transforms
into
fortresses
men
sometimes
grow
mellow
and
generous
in
the
thought
of
what
they
would
do
if
great
wealth
came
to
them
if
i
were
a
millionaire
they
say
they
let
the
phrase
melt
sweetly
in
their
mouths
as
though
it
were
a
caramel
i
would
subsidize
genius
i
would
found
a
college
i
would
build
a
great
hospital
i
would
erect
model
tenements
i
would
show
the
world
what
real
charity
is
oh
it
is
all
so
easy
so
easy
this
vicarious
benevolence
this
spending
of
other
people
fortunes
few
of
us
according
to
the
latest
statistics
have
a
million
but
we
all
have
something
some
part
of
it
are
we
living
up
to
our
portion
are
we
generous
with
what
we
have
the
man
who
is
selfish
with
one
thousand
dollars
will
not
develop
angelic
wings
of
generosity
when
his
million
comes
if
the
generous
spirit
be
a
reality
with
the
individual
instead
of
an
empty
boast
he
will
every
hour
find
opportunity
to
make
it
manifest
the
radiation
of
kindness
need
not
be
expressed
in
money
at
all
it
may
be
shown
in
a
smile
of
human
interest
a
glow
of
sympathy
a
word
of
fellowship
with
the
sorrowing
and
the
struggling
an
instinctive
outstretching
of
a
helping
hand
to
one
in
need
no
man
living
is
so
poor
that
he
can
not
evidence
his
spirit
of
benevolence
toward
his
fellowman
it
may
assume
that
rare
and
wondrously
beautiful
phase
of
divine
charity
in
realizing
how
often
a
motive
is
misrepresented
in
the
act
how
sin
sorrow
and
suffering
have
warped
and
disguised
latent
good
in
substituting
a
word
of
gentle
tolerance
for
some
cheap
tinsel
of
shabby
cynicism
that
pretends
to
be
wit
if
we
are
not
rich
enough
to
give
cold
hard
cash
let
us
at
least
be
too
rich
to
give
cold
hard
words
let
us
leave
our
of
vague
for
so
wisely
spending
millions
we
have
never
seen
and
rise
to
the
dignity
of
living
up
to
the
full
proportion
of
our
possessions
no
matter
how
slight
they
may
be
let
us
fill
the
world
around
us
with
love
brightness
sweetness
gentleness
helpfulness
courage
and
sympathy
as
if
they
were
the
only
legal
tender
and
we
were
monte
cristos
with
untold
treasures
of
such
gold
ever
at
our
call
let
us
cease
saying
if
i
were
and
say
ever
i
am
let
us
stop
living
in
the
subjunctive
mood
and
begin
to
live
in
the
indicative
the
one
great
defence
of
humanity
against
the
charge
of
unfulfilled
duties
is
lack
of
time
the
constant
clamoring
for
time
would
be
pathetic
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
most
individuals
throw
away
more
of
it
than
they
use
time
is
the
only
really
valuable
possession
of
man
for
without
it
every
power
within
him
would
cease
to
exist
yet
he
recklessly
squanders
his
great
treasure
as
if
it
were
valueless
the
wealth
of
the
whole
world
could
not
buy
one
second
of
time
yet
society
assassins
dare
to
say
in
public
that
they
have
been
killing
time
the
time
fallacy
has
put
more
people
into
than
all
other
causes
combined
life
is
only

eternity
is
only
more

immortality

in

all
that

to
keep
him
from

from

losing

of
the
glory
of

is
repudiating
the
manna
of

life
given
each
new
day
merely
because
he
misused
the
manna
of
years
ago
he
is
doubly
unwise
because
he
has
the
wisdom
of
his
past
experience
and
does
not
profit
by
it
merely
because
of
a
technicality
of
useless
morbid
regret
he

living
in

the
man
who
spends
his
time
lamenting
the
fortune
he
once
had
or
the
fame
that
has
taken
its
winged
flight
into
oblivion
frittering
away
his
golden
hours
erecting
new
monuments
in
the
cemetery
of
his
past
achievements
and
his
former
greatness
making
what
he

plead
apology
for
what
he

to
the
individual
a

potency
of

greater
than
a
thousand
nests
full

whatever
keeps
a

from
living
his
best
truest

now
in

present
if
it

something
that
he
himself
places

us
find
out
what

the
in

we

untiringly
as
man
spends
his
hours
and
his
days
and
his
weeks
in
an
he
finds
that
the
delicate
strands
and
lines
of
the
phantom
structure
gradually
become
less
and
less
airy
they
begin
to
grow
firm
and
firmer
strengthening
with
the
years
until
at
last
solid
walls
hem
him
in
then
he
is
startled
by
the
awful
realization
that
habit
and
habitancy
have
transformed
his
into
a
prison
from
which
escape
is
difficult
and
then
he
learns
that
the
most
deceptive
and
dangerous
of
all
things
is
swords
and
scabbards
swords
and
scabbards
it
is
the
custom
of
grateful
states
and
nations
to
present
swords
as
tokens
of
highest
honor
to
the
victorious
leaders
of
their
armies
and
navies
the
sword
presented
to
admiral
schley
by
the
people
of
philadelphia
at
the
close
of
america
war
with
spain
cost
over
the
greater
part
of
which
was
spent
on
the
jewels
and
decorations
on
the
scabbard
a
little
more
than
half
a
century
ago
when
general
winfield
scott
for
whom
admiral
schley
was
named
received
a
beautiful
sword
from
the
state
of
louisiana
he
was
asked
how
it
pleased
him
it
is
a
very
fine
sword
indeed
he
said
but
there
is
one
thing
about
it
i
would
have
preferred
different
the
inscription
should
be
on
the
blade
not
on
the
scabbard
the
scabbard
may
be
taken
from
us
the
sword
never
the
world
spends
too
much
time
money
and
energy
on
the
scabbard
of
life
too
little
on
the
sword
the
scabbard
represents
outside
show
vanity
and
display
the
sword
intrinsic
worth
the
scabbard
is
ever
the
semblance
the
sword
the
reality
the
scabbard
is
the
temporal
the
sword
is
the
eternal
the
scabbard
is
the
body
the
sword
is
the
soul
the
scabbard
typifies
the
material
side
of
life
the
sword
the
true
the
spiritual
the
ideal
the
man
who
does
not
dare
follow
his
own
convictions
but
who
lives
in
terror
of
what
society
will
say
falling
prostrate
before
the
golden
calf
of
public
opinion
is
living
an
empty
life
of
mere
show
he
is
sacrificing
his
individuality
his
divine
right
to
live
his
life
in
harmony
with
his
own
high
ideals
to
a
cowardly
toadying
fear
of
the
world
he
is
not
a
voice
with
the
strong
note
of
individual
purpose
he
is
but
the
thin
echo
of
the
voice
of
thousands
he
is
not
brightening
sharpening
and
using
the
sword
of
his
life
in
true
warfare
he
is
lazily
ornamenting
a
useless
scabbard
with
the
hieroglyphics
of
his
folly
the
man
who
lives
beyond
his
means
who
mortgages
his
future
for
his
present
who
is
generous
before
he
is
just
who
is
sacrificing
everything
to
keep
up
with
the
procession
of
his
superiors
is
really
losing
much
of
life
he
too
is
decorating
the
scabbard
and
letting
the
sword
rust
in
its
sheath
life
is
not
a
competition
with
others
in
its
truest
sense
it
is
rivalry
with
ourselves
we
should
each
day
seek
to
break
the
record
of
our
yesterday
we
should
seek
each
day
to
live
stronger
better
truer
lives
each
day
to
master
some
weakness
of
yesterday
each
day
to
repair
past
follies
each
day
to
surpass
ourselves
and
this
is
but
progress
and
individual
conscious
progress
progress
unending
and
unlimited
is
the
one
great
thing
that
differentiates
man
from
all
the
other
animals
then
we
will
care
naught
for
the
pretty
useless
decorations
of
society
approval
on
the
scabbard
for
us
it
will
be
enough
to
know
that
the
blade
of
our
purpose
is
kept
ever
keen
and
sharp
for
the
defense
of
right
and
truth
never
to
wrong
the
rights
of
others
but
ever
to
right
the
wrongs
of
ourselves
and
those
around
us
reputation
is
what
the
world
thinks
a
man
is
character
is
what
he
really
is
anyone
can
play
shuttlecock
with
a
man
reputation
his
character
is
his
alone
no
one
can
injure
his
character
but
he
himself
character
is
the
sword
reputation
is
the
scabbard
many
men
acquire
insomnia
in
standing
guard
over
their
reputation
while
their
character
gives
them
no
concern
often
they
make
new
dents
in
their
character
in
their
attempt
to
cut
a
deep
deceptive
filigree
on
the
scabbard
of
their
reputation
reputation
is
the
shell
a
man
discards
when
he
leaves
life
for
immortality
his
character
he
takes
with
him
the
woman
who
spends
thousands
in
charitable
donations
and
is
hard
and
uncharitable
in
her
judgments
sentimentally
sympathetic
with
human
sin
and
weakness
in
the
abstract
while
she
arrogates
to
herself
omniscience
in
her
harsh
condemnation
of
individual
lapses
is
charitable
only
on
the
outside
she
is
letting
her
tongue
undo
the
good
work
of
her
hand
she
is
too
enthusiastic
in
decorating
the
scabbard
of
publicity
to
think
of
the
sword
of
real
love
of
humanity
he
who
carries
avarice
to
the
point
of
becoming
a
miser
hoarding
gold
that
is
made
useless
to
him
because
it
does
not
fulfill
its
one
function
circulation
and
regarding
the
necessities
of
life
as
luxuries
is
one
of
nature
jests
that
would
be
humorous
were
it
not
so
serious
he
is
the
most
difficult
animal
to
classify
in
the
whole
natural
history
of
has
so
many
of
the
virtues
he
is
a
striking
example
of
ambition
economy
frugality
persistence
loyalty
to
purpose
and
generosity
to
his
heirs
these
noble
qualities
he
spoils
in
the
application
his
specialty
is
the
scabbard
of
life
he
spends
his
days
in
making
a
solid
gold
scabbard
for
the
tin
sword
of
a
wasted
existence
the
shoddy
airs
and
ostentations
extravagance
and
prodigality
of
some
who
have
suddenly
become
rich
is
goldplating
the
scabbard
without
improving
the
blade
the
superficial
veneer
of
refinement
really
accentuates
the
native
vulgarity
the
more
you
polish
woodwork
the
more
you
reveal
the
grain
some
of
the
sudden
legatees
of
fortune
have
the
wisdom
to
acquire
the
reality
of
refinement
through
careful
training
this
is
the
true
method
of
putting
the
sword
itself
in
order
instead
of
begemming
the
scabbard
the
girl
who
marries
merely
for
money
or
for
a
title
is
a
feminine
esau
of
the
beginning
of
the
century
she
is
selling
her
birthright
of
love
for
the
pottage
of
an
empty
name
forfeiting
the
possibility
of
a
life
of
love
all
that
true
womanhood
should
hold
most
dear
for
a
mere
bag
of
gold
or
a
crown
she
is
decorating
the
scabbard
with
a
crest
and
heraldic
designs
and
with
ornaments
of
pure
gold
set
with
jewels
she
feels
that
this
will
be
enough
for
life
and
that
she
does
not
need
love
love
that
has
made
this
world
a
paradise
despite
all
the
other
people
present
she
does
not
realize
that
there
is
but
one
real
reason
but
one
justification
for
marriage
and
that
is
all
the
other
motives
are
not
reasons
they
are
only
excuses
the
phrase
marrying
a
man
for
his
money
as
the
world
bluntly
puts
it
is
woman
merely
marries
the
money
and
takes
the
man
as
an
incumbrance
or
mortgage
on
the
property
the
man
who
procrastinates
filling
his
ears
with
the
lovely
song
of
is
following
the
easiest
and
most
restful
method
of
shortening
the
possibilities
of
life
procrastination
is
stifling
action
by
delay
it
is
killing
decision
by
inactivity
it
is
drifting
on
the
river
of
time
instead
of
rowing
bravely
toward
a
desired
harbor
it
is
watching
the
sands
in
the
run
down
before
beginning
any
new
work
then
reversing
the
glass
and
repeating
the
observation
the
folly
of
man
in
thus
delaying
is
apparent
when
any
second
his
life
may
stop
and
the
sands
of
that
single
hour
may
run
their
course
he
will
not
be
there
to
see
delay
is
the
narcotic
that
paralyzes
energy
when
alexander
was
asked
how
he
conquered
the
world
he
said
by
not
delaying
let
us
not
put
off
till
the
duty
of
that
which
our
mind
tells
us
should
be
done
our
mind
and
body
should
execute
is
the
sword
we
should
hold
and
use
is
but
the
scabbard
from
which
each
new
is
withdrawn
the
man
who
wears
an
oppressive
pompous
air
of
dignity
because
he
has
accomplished
some
little
work
of
importance
because
he
is
vested
with
a
brief
mantle
of
authority
loses
sight
of
the
true
perspective
of
life
he
is
destitute
of
humor
he
takes
himself
seriously
it
is
a
scabbard
on
a
sword
the
man
who
is
guilty
of
envy
is
the
victim
of
the
oldest
vice
in
the
history
of
the
world
the
meanest
and
most
despicable
of
human
traits
it
began
in
the
garden
of
eden
when
satan
envied
adam
and
eve
it
caused
the
downfall
of
man
and
the
first
unbrotherly
act
to
abel
envy
is
a
paradoxic
vice
it
can
not
suffer
bravely
the
prosperity
of
another
it
has
mental
dyspepsia
because
someone
else
is
feasting
it
makes
its
owner
clothes
turn
into
rags
at
sight
of
another
velvet
envy
is
the
malicious
contemplation
of
the
beauty
honors
success
happiness
or
triumph
of
another
it
is
the
mud
that
inferiority
throws
at
success
envy
is
the
gangrene
of
unsatisfied
ambition
it
eats
away
purpose
and
kills
energy
it
is
egotism
gone
to
seed
it
always
finds
the
secret
of
its
in
something
outside
itself
envy
is
the
scabbard
but
emulation
is
the
sword
emulation
regards
the
success
of
another
as
an
object
lesson
it
seeks
in
the
triumph
of
another
the
why
the
reason
the
inspiration
of
method
it
seeks
to
attain
the
same
heights
by
the
path
it
thus
discovers
not
to
hurl
down
from
his
eminence
him
who
points
out
the
way
of
attainment
let
us
keep
the
sword
of
emulation
ever
brightened
and
sharpened
in
the
battle
of
honest
effort
not
idly
dulling
and
rusting
in
the
scabbard
of
envy
the
supreme
folly
of
the
world
the
saddest
depths
to
which
the
human
mind
can
sink
is
atheism
he
surely
is
to
be
pitied
who
permits
the
illogical
philosophy
of
petty
infidels
or
his
misinterpretations
of
the
revelations
of
science
to
cheat
him
of
his
god
he
pins
his
faith
to
some
ingenious
sophistry
in
the
reasoning
of
those
whose
books
he
has
read
to
sum
up
for
him
the
whole
problem
and
in
hopeless
egotism
shuts
his
eyes
to
the
million
proofs
in
nature
and
life
because
the
full
plans
of
omnipotence
are
not
made
clear
to
him
on
the
technicality
of
his
failure
to
understand
some
one
it
is
why
sin
sorrow
suffering
and
injustice
exist
in
the
declares
he
will
not
believe
he
might
as
well
disbelieve
in
the
sky
above
him
because
he
can
not
see
it
all
discredit
the
air
he
breathes
because
it
is
invisible
doubt
the
reality
of
the
ocean
because
his
feeble
vision
can
take
in
but
a
few
miles
of
the
great
sea
deny
even
life
itself
because
he
can
not
see
it
and
no
anatomist
has
found
the
subtle
essence
to
hold
it
up
to
view
on
the
end
of
his
scalpel
he
dares
to
disbelieve
in
god
despite
his
countless
manifestations
because
he
is
not
taken
into
the
full
confidence
of
the
creator
and
permitted
to
look
over
and
check
off
the
of
the
universe
he
sheathes
the
sword
of
belief
in
the
dingy
scabbard
of
infidelity
he
does
not
see
the
proof
of
god
in
the
daily
miracle
of
the
rising
and
setting
of
the
sun
in
the
seasons
in
the
birds
in
the
flowers
in
the
countless
stars
moving
in
their
majestic
regularity
at
the
command
of
eternal
law
in
the
presence
of
love
justice
truth
in
the
hearts
of
men
in
that
supreme
confidence
that
is
inborn
in
humanity
making
even
the
lowest
savage
worship
the
infinite
in
some
form
it
is
the
petty
vanity
of
cheap
reasoning
that
makes
man
permit
the
misfit
scabbard
of
infidelity
to
hide
from
him
the
glory
of
the
sword
of
belief
the
philosophy
of
swords
and
scabbards
is
as
true
of
nations
as
of
individuals
when
france
committed
the
great
crime
of
the
nineteenth
century
by
condemning
dreyfus
to
infamy
and
isolation
deafening
her
ears
to
the
cries
of
justice
and
seeking
to
cover
her
shame
with
greater
shame
she
sheathed
the
sword
of
a
nation
honor
in
the
scabbard
of
a
nation
crime
the
breaking
of
the
sword
of
dreyfus
when
he
was
cruelly
degraded
before
the
army
typified
the
degradation
of
the
french
nation
in
breaking
the
sword
of
justice
and
preserving
carefully
the
empty
scabbard
with
its
ironic
inscription
vive
la
justice
the
scabbard
is
ever
useless
in
the
hour
of
emergency
it
is
upon
the
sword
itself
that
we
must
rely
then
the
worthlessness
of
show
sham
pretence
gilded
weakness
is
revealed
to
us
then
the
trivialities
of
life
are
seen
in
their
true
form
the
nothingness
of
everything
but
the
real
the
tried
the
true
is
made
luminant
in
an
instant
then
we
know
whether
our
living
has
been
one
of
true
preparation
of
keeping
the
sword
clean
pure
sharp
and
ready
or
one
of
mere
idle
meaningless
markings
of
folly
on
the
empty
scabbard
of
a
wasted
life
the
conquest
of
the
preventable
the
conquest
of
the
preventable
this
world
would
be
a
delightful
place
to
live
it
were
not
for
the
people
they
really
cause
all
the
trouble
man
worst
enemy
is
always
man
he
began
to
throw
the
responsibility
of
his
transgressions
on
some
one
else
in
the
garden
of
eden
and
he
has
been
doing
so
ever
since
the
greater
part
of
the
pain
sorrow
and
misery
in
life
is
purely
a
human
invention
yet
man
with
cowardly
irreverence
dares
to
throw
the
responsibility
on
god
it
comes
through
breaking
laws
laws
natural
physical
civic
mental
or
moral
these
are
laws
which
man
knows
but
he
disregards
he
takes
chances
he
thinks
he
can
dodge
results
in
some
way
but
nature
says
he
who
breaks
pays
there
are
no
laws
on
the
divine
of
life
when
a
man
permits
a
torchlight
procession
to
parade
through
a
powder
magazine
it
is
not
courteous
for
him
to
refer
to
the
subsequent
explosion
as
one
of
the
mysterious
workings
of
providence
nine
tenths
of
the
world
sorrow
misfortune
and
unhappiness
is
preventable
the
daily
newspapers
are
the
great
chroniclers
of
the
dominance
of
the
unnecessary
paragraph
after
paragraph
column
after
column
and
page
after
page
of
the
dark
disasters
crime
scandal
human
weakness
and
be
checked
off
with
the
word
preventable
in
each
instance
were
our
information
full
enough
our
analysis
keen
enough
we
could
trace
each
back
to
its
cause
to
the
weakness
or
the
wrong
from
which
it
emanated
sometimes
it
is
carelessness
inattention
neglect
of
duty
avarice
anger
jealousy
dissipation
betrayal
of
trust
selfishness
hypocrisy
revenge
dishonesty
of
a
hundred
phases
of
the
preventable
that
which
be
prevented
be
prevented
it
all
rests
with
the
individual
the
preventable
exists
in
three
degrees
first
that
which
is
due
to
the
individual
solely
and
directly
second
that
which
he
suffers
through
the
of
those
around
him
other
individuals
third
those
instances
wherein
he
is
the
unnecessary
victim
of
the
wrongs
of
society
the
innocent
legatee
of
the
folly
of
society
is
but
the
massing
of
thousands
of
individuals
with
the
heritage
of
manners
customs
and
laws
they
have
received
from
the
past
we
sometimes
feel
and
weary
in
facing
failure
when
the
fortune
that
seemed
almost
in
our
fingers
slips
away
because
of
the
envy
malice
or
treachery
of
some
one
else
we
bow
under
the
weight
of
a
sorrow
that
makes
all
life
grow
dark
and
the
star
of
hope
fade
from
our
vision
or
we
meet
some
unnecessary
misfortune
with
a
dumb
helpless
despair
it
is
all
wrong
we
say
it
is
cruel
it
is
unjust
why
is
it
permitted
and
in
the
very
intensity
of
our
feeling
we
repeat
the
words
over
and
over
again
in
monotonous
iteration
as
if
in
some
way
the
very
repetition
might
bring
relief
might
somehow
soothe
us
yet
in
most
instances
it
could
be
prevented
no
suffering
is
caused
in
the
world
by
right
whatever
sorrow
there
is
that
is
preventable
comes
from
inharmony
or
wrong
of
some
kind
in
the
divine
economy
of
the
universe
most
of
the
evil
pain
and
suffering
are
unnecessary
even
when
overruled
for
good
and
perhaps
if
our
knowledge
were
perfect
it
would
be
seen
that
none
is
necessary
that
all
is
preventable
the
fault
is
mine
or
yours
or
the
fault
of
the
world
it
is
always
individual
the
world
itself
is
but
the
cohesive
united
force
of
the
thoughts
words
and
deeds
of
millions
who
have
lived
or
who
are
living
like
you
and
me
by
individuals
has
the
great
wrong
that
causes
our
preventable
sorrow
been
built
up
by
individuals
must
it
be
weakened
and
transformed
to
right
and
in
this
too
it
is
to
a
great
degree
our
fault
we
care
so
little
about
rousing
public
sentiment
of
lashing
it
into
activity
unless
it
concerns
us
individually
the
old
greek
fable
of
atlas
the
african
king
who
supported
the
world
on
his
shoulders
has
a
modern
application
the
is
the
atlas
upon
whom
the
fate
of
the
world
rests
let
each
individual
do
his
best
the
result
is
foreordained
it
is
but
a
matter
of
the
unconquerable
massing
of
the
units
let
each
individual
bear
his
part
as
faithfully
as
though
all
the
responsibility
rested
on
him
yet
as
calmly
as
gently
and
as
unworried
as
though
all
the
responsibility
rested
on
others
most
accidents
are
at
balaclava
someone
has
blundered
one
of
the
great
disasters
of
the
nineteenth
century
was
the
johnstown
flood
where
the
bursting
of
a
dam
caused
the
loss
of
more
than
six
thousand
lives
the
flood
was
not
a
mere
accident
it
was
a
crime
a
leaking
dam
for
more
than
a
year
known
to
be
unsafe
known
to
be
unable
to
withstand
any
increased
pressure
stood
at
the
head
of
the
valley
below
it
lay
a
chain
of
villages
containing
over
thousand
persons
in
the
direct
line
of
the
flood
when
the
heavy
rains
came
the
weakened
dam
gave
way
had
there
been
individual
one
member
of
the
south
fork
fishing
club
brave
enough
to
have
done
merely
his
duty
member
with
the
courage
to
so
move
his
fellows
and
to
stir
up
public
action
to
make
the
barrier
safe
over
six
thousand
murders
could
have
been
prevented
when
a
tired
engineer
sleepy
from
overwork
can
no
longer
cheat
nature
of
her
needed
rest
and
drowsing
for
a
moment
in
his
cab
fails
to
see
the
red
signal
light
of
danger
or
to
heed
the
exploding
of
the
warning
torpedo
the
wreck
that
follows
is
not
chargeable
to
the
almighty
it
is
but
an
awful
memorial
of
a
railroad
struggle
to
save
two
dollars
one
ounce
of
prevention
is
worth
six
pounds
of
coroner
inquest
it
is
a
crime
to
balance
the
safety
and
sacredness
of
human
life
in
the
scales
with
the
petty
saving
that
comes
from
transforming
a
man
into
a
mechanism
and
forgetting
he
has
either
a
soul
or
a
body
true
just
and
wise
labor
laws
are
part
of
weapon
for
fighting
the
preventable
when
a
terrible
fire
makes
a
city
desolate
and
a
nation
mourn
the
investigation
that
follows
usually
shows
that
a
little
human
foresight
could
have
prevented
it
or
at
least
lessened
the
horror
of
it
all
if
chemicals
or
dynamite
are
stored
in
any
building
in
excess
of
what
wise
legislation
declares
is
safe
some
one
has
been
cruelly
careless
perhaps
it
is
some
inspector
who
has
been
disloyal
to
his
trust
by
permitting
bribes
to
chloroform
his
sense
of
duty
if
the
lack
of
adds
its
quota
to
the
list
of
deaths
or
if
the
avarice
of
the
owner
has
made
his
building
a
public
feeling
becomes
intense
the
newspapers
are
justly
loud
in
their
protests
and
in
demands
that
the
guilty
ones
be
punished
if
the
laws
already
on
the
statute
books
do
not
cover
the
situation
we
hear
from
day
to
day
new
laws
will
be
framed
to
make
a
repetition
of
the
tragedy
impossible
we
are
promised
all
kinds
of
reforms
the
air
seems
filled
with
a
spirit
of
regeneration
the
mercury
of
public
indignation
rises
to
the
point
where
seems
a
mild
inadequate
term
then
as
the
horror
begins
to
fade
in
the
perspective
of
the
past
men
go
quietly
back
to
their
own
personal
cares
and
duties
and
the
mighty
wave
of
righteous
protest
that
threatened
so
much
dies
in
gentle
lapping
on
the
shore
what
has
been
all
men
concern
seems
soon
to
concern
no
one
the
tremendous
energy
of
the
authorities
seems
like
the
gesture
of
a
drunken
man
that
starts
from
his
shoulder
with
a
force
that
would
almost
fell
an
ox
but
when
it
reaches
the
hand
it
has
expended
itself
and
the
hand
drops
listlessly
in
the
air
with
hardly
power
enough
to
disturb
the
serenity
of
a
butterfly
there
is
always
a
little
progress
a
slight
advance
and
it
is
only
the
constant
accumulation
of
these
steps
that
is
giving
to
the
world
greater
dominion
over
the
preventable
constant
vigilance
is
the
price
of
the
conquest
of
the
preventable
we
have
no
right
to
admit
any
wrong
or
evil
in
the
world
as
necessary
until
we
have
exhausted
every
precaution
that
human
wisdom
can
suggest
to
prevent
it
when
a
man
with
a
pistol
in
his
right
hand
clumsily
covered
with
a
handkerchief
moved
along
in
a
line
of
people
and
presenting
his
left
hand
to
president
mckinley
pressed
his
weapon
to
the
breast
of
the
chief
executive
of
the
american
people
some
one
of
the
secret
service
men
paid
by
the
nation
to
guard
their
ruler
should
have
watched
so
zealously
that
the
tragedy
would
have
been
impossible
two
presidents
had
already
been
sacrificed
but
twenty
years
of
immunity
had
brought
a
dreamy
sense
of
security
that
lessened
the
vigilance
we
should
emulate
the
example
of
the
insurance
companies
who
decline
certain
risks
that
are
extra
hazardous
poverty
has
no
necessary
place
in
life
it
is
a
disease
that
results
from
the
weakness
sin
and
selfishness
of
humanity
nature
is
boundless
in
her
generosity
the
world
produces
sufficient
to
give
food
clothing
and
comfort
to
every
individual
poverty
is
preventable
poverty
may
result
from
the
shiftlessness
idleness
intemperance
improvidence
lack
of
purpose
or
of
the
individual
himself
if
the
causes
do
not
exist
in
the
individual
they
may
be
found
in
the
second
class
in
the
of
those
around
him
in
the
oppression
of
labor
by
capital
in
the
grinding
process
by
which
corporations
seek
to
crush
the
individual
the
individual
may
be
the
victim
of
any
of
a
thousand
phases
of
the
wrong
of
others
the
poverty
caused
by
the
third
class
the
weakness
and
injustice
of
human
laws
and
human
institutions
is
also
preventable
but
to
reach
the
cause
requires
time
and
united
heroic
effort
of
all
individuals
in
the
battle
against
poverty
those
writers
who
seek
to
inflame
the
poor
against
the
rich
to
foment
discontent
between
labor
and
capital
do
grievous
wrong
to
both
what
the
world
needs
is
to
have
the
two
brought
closer
together
in
the
bonds
of
human
brotherhood
the
poor
should
learn
more
of
the
cares
responsibilities
unrecorded
charities
and
absorbing
worries
of
the
rich
the
rich
should
learn
more
intimately
the
sorrows
privations
struggles
and
despair
of
poverty
the
world
is
learning
the
great
truth
that
the
best
way
to
prevent
crime
is
to
study
the
sociologic
conditions
in
which
it
flourishes
to
seek
to
give
each
man
a
better
chance
of
living
his
real
life
by
removing
if
possible
the
elements
that
make
wrong
easy
and
to
him
almost
necessary
and
by
inspiring
him
to
fight
life
battle
bravely
with
all
the
help
others
can
give
him
science
is
coöperating
with
religion
in
striving
to
conquer
the
evil
at
the
root
instead
of
the
evil
manifest
as
crime
in
the
fruit
of
the
branches
it
is
so
much
wiser
to
prevent
than
to
cure
to
keep
some
one
from
being
burned
is
so
much
better
than
inventing
new
poultices
for
unnecessary
hurts
it
is
ever
the
little
things
that
make
up
the
sum
of
human
misery
all
the
wild
animals
of
the
world
combined
do
but
trifling
damage
when
compared
with
the
ravages
of
insect
pests
the
crimes
of
humanity
the
sins
that
make
us
start
back
affrighted
do
not
cause
as
much
sorrow
and
unhappiness
in
life
as
the
multitude
of
little
sins
of
omission
and
commission
that
the
individual
and
millions
like
him
must
meet
every
day
they
are
not
the
evil
deeds
that
the
law
can
reach
or
punish
they
are
but
the
infinity
of
petty
wrongs
for
which
man
can
never
be
tried
until
he
stands
with
bowed
head
before
the
bar
of
justice
of
his
own
conscience
the
bitter
words
of
anger
and
reproach
that
rise
so
easily
to
our
lips
and
give
us
a
moment
fleeting
satisfaction
in
thus
venting
our
feelings
may
change
the
current
of
the
whole
life
of
some
one
near
to
us
the
thoughtless
speech
revealing
our
lack
of
tact
and
sympathy
can
not
be
recalled
and
made
nothing
by
the
plea
i
did
think
to
sensitive
souls
this
is
no
justification
they
feel
that
our
hearts
should
be
so
filled
with
the
instinct
of
love
that
our
lips
would
need
no
tutor
or
guardian
our
unfulfilled
duty
may
bring
unhappiness
and
misery
to
hundreds
the
dressmaker
bill
that
a
rich
woman
may
toss
lightly
aside
as
being
an
affair
of
no
moment
to
be
settled
at
her
serene
pleasure
may
bring
sorrow
privation
or
even
failure
to
her
debtor
and
through
her
to
a
long
chain
of
others
the
result
if
seen
in
all
its
stern
reality
seems
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
cause
there
are
places
in
the
alps
where
great
masses
of
snow
are
so
lightly
poised
that
even
the
report
of
a
gun
might
start
a
vibration
that
would
dislodge
an
avalanche
and
send
it
on
its
into
the
valley
the
individual
who
would
live
his
life
to
the
best
that
is
within
him
must
make
each
moment
one
of
influence
for
good
he
must
set
before
him
as
one
of
his
ideals
to
be
progressively
realized
in
each
day
of
his
living
if
i
can
not
accomplish
great
deeds
in
the
world
i
will
do
all
the
good
i
can
by
the
faithful
performance
of
the
duties
that
come
to
my
hand
and
being
ever
ready
for
all
opportunities
and
i
will
consecrate
myself
to
the
conquest
of
the
preventable
let
the
individual
say
each
day
as
he
rises
to
face
a
new
life
no
one
in
the
world
shall
suffer
because
i
live
i
will
be
kind
considerate
careful
in
thought
and
speech
and
act
i
will
seek
to
discover
the
element
that
weakens
me
as
a
power
in
the
world
and
that
keeps
me
from
living
up
to
the
fullness
of
my
possibility
that
weakness
i
will
master
i
will
conquer
it
at
any
cost
when
any
failure
or
sorrow
comes
to
the
individual
he
should
be
glad
if
he
can
prove
to
himself
that
it
was
his
fault
then
he
has
the
remedy
in
his
own
hands
lying
intrigue
jealousy
are
never
remedies
that
can
an
evil
they
postpone
it
merely
to
augment
it
they
are
merely
deferring
payment
of
a
debt
which
has
to
be
met
later
compound
interest
it
is
like
trying
to
put
out
a
fire
by
pouring
kerosene
on
the
flames
jealousy
in
the
beginning
is
but
a
thought
the
end
it
may
mean
the
gallows
selfishness
often
assumes
seemingly
harmless
guises
yet
it
is
the
foundation
of
the
world
unhappiness
disloyalty
may
seem
to
be
a
rare
quality
but
society
is
saturated
with
it
judas
acquired
his
reputation
because
of
his
proficiency
in
it
sympathy
which
should
be
the
atmosphere
of
every
individual
life
is
as
rare
as
human
charity
the
world
is
suffering
from
an
of
unnecessary
evils
created
by
man
they
should
be
made
luxuries
then
man
could
dispense
with
them
the
world
needs
societies
formed
of
members
pledged
to
the
individual
conquest
of
preventable
pain
and
sorrow
the
individual
has
no
right
that
runs
counter
to
the
right
of
any
one
else
there
are
no
solo
parts
in
the
eternal
music
of
life
each
must
pour
out
his
life
in
duo
with
every
other
every
moment
must
be
one
of
choice
of
good
or
of
evil
which
will
the
individual
choose
his
life
will
be
his
answer
let
him
dedicate
his
life
to
making
the
world
around
him
brighter
sweeter
and
better
and
by
his
conquest
of
preventable
pain
and
sorrow
he
will
day
by
day
get
fuller
revelation
of
the
glory
of
the
possibilities
of
individual
living
and
come
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
realization
of
his
ideals
the
companionship
of
tolerance
the
companionship
of
tolerance
intolerance
is
part
of
the
unnecessary
friction
of
life
it
is
prejudice
on
the
intolerance
acknowledges
only
one
side
of
any
question
own
it
is
the
assumption
of
a
monopoly
in
thinking
the
attitude
of
the
man
who
believes
he
has
a
corner
on
wisdom
and
truth
in
some
phase
of
life
tolerance
is
a
calm
generous
respect
for
the
opinions
of
others
even
of
one
enemies
it
recognizes
the
right
of
every
man
to
think
his
own
thoughts
to
live
his
own
life
to
be
himself
in
all
things
so
long
as
he
does
not
run
counter
to
the
rights
of
others
it
means
giving
to
others
the
same
freedom
that
we
ourselves
crave
tolerance
is
silent
justice
blended
with
sympathy
if
he
who
is
tolerant
desires
to
show
to
others
the
truth
as
he
sees
it
he
seeks
with
gentleness
and
deference
to
point
out
the
way
in
which
he
has
found
peace
and
certainty
and
rest
he
tries
to
raise
them
to
the
recognition
of
higher
ideals
as
he
has
found
them
inspiring
he
endeavors
in
a
spirit
of
love
and
comradeship
with
humanity
to
lead
others
rather
than
to
drive
them
to
persuade
and
convince
rather
than
to
overawe
and
eclipse
tolerance
does
not
use
the
of
argument
or
the
club
of
sarcasm
or
the
rapier
of
ridicule
in
discussing
the
weakness
or
wrongs
of
individuals
it
may
lash
or
scourge
the
evil
of
an
age
but
it
is
kind
and
tender
with
the
individual
it
may
flay
the
sin
but
not
the
sinner
tolerance
makes
the
individual
regard
truth
as
higher
than
personal
opinion
it
teaches
him
to
live
with
the
windows
of
his
life
open
towards
the
east
to
catch
the
first
rays
of
the
sunlight
of
truth
no
matter
from
whom
it
comes
and
to
realize
that
the
faith
that
he
so
harshly
condemns
may
have
the
truth
he
desires
if
he
would
only
look
into
it
and
test
it
before
he
repudiates
it
so
cavalierly
this
world
of
ours
is
growing
better
more
tolerant
and
liberal
the
days
when
difference
in
political
opinions
was
solved
and
cured
by
the
axe
and
the
block
when
a
man
courage
to
stand
by
his
religion
meant
facing
the
horrors
of
the
inquisition
or
the
cruelty
of
the
stake
when
daring
to
think
their
own
thoughts
on
questions
of
science
brought
noble
men
to
a
pallet
of
straw
and
a
dungeon
cell
days
have
happily
passed
away
intolerance
and
its
twin
brother
ignorance
weaken
and
die
when
the
pure
white
light
of
wisdom
is
thrown
upon
them
knowledge
is
the
of
mere
nor
education
in
schools
or
colleges
nor
accumulation
of
mere
statistics
nor
shreds
of
information
but
the
large
sympathetic
study
of
the
lives
manners
customs
aims
thoughts
struggles
progress
motives
and
ideals
of
other
ages
other
nations
other
individuals
tolerance
unites
men
in
the
closer
bonds
of
human
brotherhood
brings
them
together
in
unity
and
sympathy
in
essentials
and
gives
them
greater
liberality
and
freedom
in
napoleon
when
first
consul
said
let
there
be
no
more
jacobins
nor
moderates
nor
royalists
let
all
be
frenchmen
sectionalism
and
sectarianism
always
mean
concentration
on
the
body
of
a
part
at
the
expense
of
the
soul
of
the
whole
the
religious
world
needs
more
christ
and
less
sects
in
its
gospel
when
christ
lived
on
earth
christianity
was
a
unit
when
he
died
sects
began
there
are
in
america
hundreds
of
small
towns
scattered
over
the
face
of
the
land
that
are
with
churches
in
many
of
these
towns
just
emerging
from
the
short
dresses
of
there
are
a
dozen
or
more
weak
churches
struggling
to
keep
their
organization
alive
between
these
churches
there
is
often
only
a
slight
difference
in
creed
the
wall
of
some
technicality
of
belief
dragging
out
a
mere
existence
trying
to
fight
a
large
mortgage
with
a
small
congregation
and
a
small
contribution
box
there
is
little
spiritual
fervor
by
combination
by
coöperation
by
tolerance
by
the
mutual
surrender
of
and
a
strong
vital
concentration
and
unity
on
the
great
fundamental
realities
of
christianity
their
spiritual
health
and
possibilities
could
be
marvellously
increased
three
or
four
sturdy
live
growing
churches
would
then
take
the
place
of
a
dozen
strugglers
why
have
a
dozen
weak
bridges
across
a
stream
if
greater
good
can
come
from
three
or
four
stronger
ones
or
even
a
single
strongest
bridge
the
world
needs
a
great
religious
trust
which
will
unite
the
churches
into
a
single
body
of
faith
to
precede
and
prepare
the
way
for
the
greater
religious
trust
predicted
in
holy
writ
millennium
we
can
ever
be
loyal
to
our
own
belief
faithful
to
our
own
cause
without
condemning
those
who
give
their
fidelity
in
accord
with
their
own
conscience
or
desires
the
great
reformers
of
the
world
men
who
are
honestly
and
earnestly
seeking
to
solve
the
great
social
problems
and
to
provide
means
for
meeting
human
sin
and
wrong
agreeing
perfectly
in
their
estimate
of
the
gravity
and
awfulness
of
the
situation
often
propose
diametrically
opposite
methods
they
are
regarding
the
subject
from
different
points
of
view
and
it
would
be
intolerance
for
us
who
are
looking
on
to
condemn
the
men
on
either
side
merely
because
we
can
not
accept
their
verdict
as
our
own
on
the
great
national
questions
brought
before
statesmen
for
their
decision
men
equally
able
equally
sincere
just
and
unselfish
differ
in
their
remedies
one
as
a
surgeon
suggests
cutting
away
the
offending
matter
the
use
of
the
knife
typifies
the
sword
or
war
another
as
a
doctor
urges
medicine
that
will
absorb
and
cure
is
the
prescription
of
the
diplomat
the
third
suggests
waiting
for
developments
leaving
the
case
with
time
and
nature
is
the
conservative
but
all
three
classes
agree
as
to
the
evil
and
the
need
of
meeting
it
the
conflict
of
authorities
on
every
great
question
to
be
settled
by
human
judgment
should
make
us
tolerant
of
the
opinion
of
others
though
we
may
be
as
confident
of
the
rightness
of
the
judgment
we
have
formed
as
if
it
were
foreordained
from
the
day
of
the
creation
but
if
we
receive
any
new
light
that
makes
us
see
clearer
let
us
change
at
once
without
that
foolish
consistency
of
some
natures
that
continue
to
use
last
year
almanac
as
a
guide
to
this
year
eclipses
tolerance
is
ever
progressive
intolerance
believes
it
is
born
with
the
peculiar
talent
for
managing
the
affairs
of
others
without
any
knowledge
of
the
details
better
than
the
men
themselves
who
are
giving
their
life
thought
to
the
vital
questions
intolerance
is
the
voice
of
the
pharisee
still
crying
through
the
ages
and
proclaiming
his
infallibility
let
us
not
seek
to
fit
the
whole
world
with
shoes
from
our
individual
last
if
we
think
that
all
music
ceased
to
be
written
when
wagner
laid
down
the
pen
let
us
not
condemn
those
who
find
enjoyment
in
light
opera
perhaps
they
may
sometime
rise
to
our
heights
of
artistic
appreciation
and
learn
the
proper
parts
to
applaud
if
their
lighter
music
satisfies
their
souls
is
our
wagner
doing
more
for
us
it
is
not
fair
to
take
from
a
child
its
rag
doll
in
order
to
raise
it
to
the
appreciation
of
the
venus
de
milo
the
rag
doll
is
its
venus
it
may
require
a
long
series
of
increasingly
better
dolls
to
lead
it
to
realize
the
beauties
of
the
marble
woman
of
melos
intolerance
makes
its
great
mistakes
in
measuring
the
needs
of
others
from
its
own
standpoint
intolerance
ignores
the
personal
equation
in
life
what
would
be
an
excellent
book
for
a
man
of
forty
might
be
worse
than
useless
for
a
boy
of
thirteen
the
line
of
activity
in
life
that
we
would
choose
as
our
highest
dream
of
bliss
as
our
paradise
might
if
forced
on
another
be
to
him
worse
than
the
fate
of
the
wicked
according
to
the
theologians
what
would
be
a
very
acceptable
breakfast
for
a
sparrow
would
be
a
very
poor
meal
for
an
elephant
when
we
sit
in
solemn
judgment
of
the
acts
and
characters
of
those
around
us
and
condemn
them
with
the
easy
nonchalance
of
our
ignorance
yet
with
the
assumption
of
omniscience
we
reveal
our
intolerance
tolerance
ever
leads
us
to
recognize
and
respect
the
differences
in
the
natures
of
those
who
are
near
to
us
to
make
allowance
for
differences
in
training
in
opportunities
in
ideals
in
motives
in
tastes
in
opinions
in
temperaments
and
in
feelings
intolerance
seeks
to
live
other
people
lives
them
sympathy
helps
us
to
live
their
lives
them
we
must
accept
humanity
with
all
its
weakness
sin
and
folly
and
seek
to
make
the
best
of
it
just
as
humanity
must
accept
us
we
learn
this
lesson
as
we
grow
older
and
with
the
increase
of
our
knowledge
of
the
world
we
see
how
much
happier
life
would
have
been
for
us
and
for
others
if
we
had
been
more
tolerant
more
charitable
more
generous
no
one
in
the
world
is
absolutely
perfect
if
he
were
he
would
probably
be
translated
from
earth
to
heaven
as
was
elijah
of
old
without
waiting
for
the
sprouting
of
wings
or
the
passport
of
death
it
is
a
hard
lesson
for
youth
to
learn
but
we
must
realize
as
the
old
college
professor
said
to
his
class
of
students
bowed
with
the
consciousness
of
their
wisdom
no
one
of
us
is
infallible
no
not
even
the
youngest
let
us
accept
the
little
failings
of
those
around
us
as
we
accept
facts
in
nature
and
make
the
best
of
them
as
we
accept
the
hard
shells
of
nuts
the
skin
of
fruits
the
shadow
that
always
accompanies
light
these
are
not
absolute
faults
they
are
often
but
individual
peculiarities
intolerance
sees
the
mote
in
its
eye
as
larger
than
the
beam
in
its
own
instead
of
concentrating
our
thought
on
the
one
weak
spot
in
a
character
let
us
seek
to
find
some
good
quality
that
offsets
it
just
as
a
credit
may
more
than
cancel
a
debt
on
a
ledger
account
let
us
not
constantly
speak
of
roses
having
thorns
let
us
be
thankful
that
the
thorns
have
roses
in
nature
there
are
both
thorns
and
prickles
thorns
are
organic
they
have
their
root
deep
in
the
fibre
and
the
being
of
the
twig
prickles
are
superficial
they
are
lightly
held
in
the
cuticle
or
covering
of
the
twig
there
are
thorns
in
character
that
reveal
an
internal
inharmony
that
can
be
controlled
only
from
within
there
are
also
prickles
which
are
merely
peculiarities
of
temperament
that
the
eye
of
tolerance
may
overlook
and
the
finger
of
charity
can
gently
remove
the
tenderness
of
tolerance
will
illuminate
and
glorify
the
world
moonlight
makes
all
things
beautiful
we
only
permit
it
measuring
a
man
by
his
weakness
alone
is
unjust
this
little
frailty
may
be
but
a
small
mortgage
on
a
large
estate
and
it
is
narrow
and
petty
to
judge
by
the
mortgage
on
a
character
let
us
consider
the
equity
the
excess
of
the
real
value
over
the
claim
against
it
unless
we
sympathetically
seek
to
discover
the
motive
behind
the
act
to
see
the
circumstances
that
inspired
a
course
of
living
the
target
at
which
a
man
is
aiming
our
snap
condemnations
are
but
arrogant
and
egotistic
expressions
of
our
intolerance
all
things
must
be
studied
relatively
instead
of
absolutely
the
hour
hand
on
a
clock
does
just
as
valuable
work
as
the
minute
hand
even
though
it
is
shorter
and
seems
to
do
only
as
much
intolerance
in
the
home
circle
shows
itself
in
overdiscipline
in
an
atmosphere
of
severity
heavy
with
prohibitions
the
home
becomes
a
place
strewn
with
please
keep
off
the
grass
signs
it
means
the
suppression
of
individuality
the
breaking
of
the
wills
of
children
instead
of
their
development
and
direction
it
is
the
foolish
attempt
to
mould
them
from
the
outside
as
a
potter
does
clay
the
higher
conception
is
the
wise
training
that
helps
the
child
to
help
himself
in
his
own
growth
parents
often
forget
their
own
youth
they
do
not
sympathize
with
their
children
in
their
need
of
pleasure
of
dress
of
companionship
there
should
be
a
few
absolutely
firm
rules
on
essentials
the
basic
principles
of
living
with
the
largest
possible
leeway
for
the
varying
manifestations
of
individuality
in
unimportant
phases
confidence
sympathy
love
and
trust
would
generate
a
spirit
of
tolerance
and
sweetness
that
would
work
marvels
intolerance
converts
live
natural
children
into
prigs
of
counterfeit
virtue
and
irritatingly
good
automatons
of
obedience
tolerance
is
a
state
of
mutual
concessions
in
the
family
life
there
should
be
this
constant
reciprocity
of
independence
this
mutual
forbearance
it
is
the
instinctive
recognition
of
the
sacredness
of
individuality
the
right
of
each
to
live
his
own
life
as
best
he
can
when
we
set
ourselves
up
as
dictators
to
tyrannize
over
the
thoughts
words
and
acts
of
others
we
are
sacrificing
the
kingly
power
of
influence
with
which
we
may
help
others
for
the
petty
triumph
of
tyranny
which
repels
and
loses
them
perhaps
one
reason
why
the
sons
of
great
and
good
men
so
often
go
astray
is
that
the
earnestness
strength
and
virtue
of
the
father
exacting
strict
obedience
to
the
letter
of
the
law
kills
the
appreciation
of
the
spirit
of
it
breeding
an
intolerance
that
forces
submission
under
which
the
fire
of
protest
and
rebellion
is
smouldering
ready
to
burst
into
flame
at
the
first
breath
of
freedom
between
brother
and
sister
husband
and
wife
parent
and
child
master
and
servant
the
spirit
of
tolerance
of
making
allowances
transforms
a
house
of
gloom
and
harshness
into
a
home
of
sweetness
and
love
in
the
sacred
relation
of
parent
to
child
there
always
comes
a
time
when
the
boy
becomes
a
man
when
she
whom
the
father
still
regards
but
as
a
little
girl
faces
the
great
problems
of
life
as
an
individual
the
coming
of
years
of
discretion
brings
a
day
when
the
parents
must
surrender
their
powers
of
trusteeship
when
the
individual
enters
upon
his
heritage
of
freedom
and
responsibility
parents
have
still
the
right
and
privilege
of
counsel
and
of
helpful
loving
insight
their
children
should
respect
but
in
meeting
a
great
question
when
the
son
or
daughter
stands
before
a
problem
that
means
happiness
or
misery
for
a
lifetime
it
must
be
for
him
or
for
her
to
decide
coercion
bribery
undue
influence
threats
of
disinheritance
and
the
other
familiar
weapons
are
cruel
selfish
arrogant
and
unjust
a
child
is
a
human
being
free
to
make
his
own
life
not
a
slave
there
is
a
clearly
marked
that
it
is
intolerance
to
cross
let
us
realize
that
tolerance
is
ever
broadening
it
develops
sympathy
weakens
worry
and
inspires
calmness
it
is
but
charity
and
optimism
it
is
christianity
as
a
living
eternal
fact
not
a
mere
theory
let
us
be
tolerant
of
the
weakness
of
others
sternly
intolerant
of
our
own
let
us
seek
to
forgive
and
forget
the
faults
of
others
losing
sight
to
a
degree
of
what
they
are
in
the
thought
of
what
they
may
become
let
us
fill
their
souls
with
the
inspiring
revelation
of
their
possibilities
in
the
majestic
evolution
march
of
humanity
let
us
see
for
ourselves
and
for
them
in
the
acorn
of
their
present
the
towering
oak
of
their
future
we
should
realize
the
right
of
every
human
soul
to
work
out
its
own
destiny
with
our
aid
our
sympathy
our
inspiration
if
we
are
thus
privileged
to
help
him
to
live
his
life
but
it
is
intolerance
to
try
to
live
it
for
him
he
sits
alone
on
the
throne
of
his
individuality
he
must
reign
alone
and
at
the
close
of
his
rule
must
give
his
own
account
to
the
god
of
the
ages
of
the
deeds
of
his
kingship
life
is
a
dignified
privilege
a
glorious
prerogative
of
every
man
and
it
is
arrogant
intolerance
that
touches
the
sacred
ark
with
the
hand
of
unkind
condemnation
the
things
that
come
too
late
the
things
that
come
too
late
time
seems
a
grim
old
humorist
with
a
fondness
for
afterthoughts
the
things
that
come
too
late
are
part
of
his
sarcasm
each
generation
is
engaged
in
correcting
the
errors
of
its
predecessors
and
in
supplying
new
blunders
for
its
own
posterity
to
set
right
each
generation
bequeaths
to
its
successor
its
wisdom
and
its
folly
its
wealth
of
knowledge
and
its
debts
of
error
and
failure
the
things
that
come
too
late
thus
mean
only
the
delayed
payments
on
old
debts
they
mean
that
the
world
is
growing
wiser
and
better
truer
nobler
and
more
just
it
is
emerging
from
the
dark
shadows
of
error
into
the
sunshine
of
truth
and
justice
they
prove
that
time
is
weaving
a
beauteous
fabric
from
the
warp
and
woof
of
humanity
made
up
of
shreds
and
tangles
of
error
and
truth
the
things
that
come
too
late
are
the
fuller
wisdom
the
deferred
honors
the
truer
conception
of
the
work
of
pioneers
the
brave
sturdy
fighters
who
battled
alone
for
truth
and
were
misunderstood
and
unrecognized
it
means
the
world
finer
attitude
toward
life
if
looked
at
superficially
the
things
that
come
too
late
make
us
feel
helpless
hopeless
pessimistic
if
seen
with
the
eye
of
deeper
wisdom
they
reveal
to
us
the
grand
evolution
march
of
humanity
toward
higher
things
it
is
nature
proclamation
that
in
the
end
right
triumph
truth
conquer
and
justice
reign
for
us
as
individuals
it
is
a
warning
and
an
inspiration
warning
against
withholding
love
charity
kindness
sympathy
justice
and
helpfulness
till
it
is
too
late
an
inspiration
for
us
to
live
ever
at
our
best
ever
up
to
the
maximum
of
effort
not
worrying
about
results
but
serenely
confident
that
they
come
it
takes
over
thirty
years
for
the
light
of
some
of
the
stars
to
reach
the
earth
some
a
hundred
some
a
thousand
years
those
stars
do
not
become
visible
till
their
light
reaches
and
reacts
on
human
vision
it
takes
an
almost
equal
time
for
the
light
of
some
of
the
great
geniuses
to
meet
real
seeing
eyes
then
we
see
these
men
as
the
brilliant
stars
in
the
world
gallery
of
immortal
great
ones
this
is
why
contemporary
reputation
rarely
indicates
lasting
fame
we
are
constantly
mistaking
fireflies
of
cleverness
for
stars
of
genius
but
time
brings
all
things
right
the
fame
though
brings
no
joy
or
encouragement
or
inspiration
to
him
who
has
passed
beyond
this
world
lights
and
shadows
it
has
the
sadness
of
the
honors
that
come
too
late
a
touch
of
the
farcical
mingled
with
its
pathos
tardy
recognition
is
better
than
none
at
all
it
is
better
though
late
than
never
but
it
is
so
much
truer
and
kinder
and
more
valuable
if
never
late
we
are
so
inclined
to
send
our
condemnation
and
our
snapshot
criticisms
by
express
and
our
careful
honest
commendation
by
slow
freight
in
october
roger
williams
because
of
his
inspiring
pleas
for
individual
liberty
was
ordered
by
the
general
court
of
massachusetts
to
leave
the
colony
forever
he
went
to
rhode
island
where
he
lived
for
nearly
fifty
years
but
the
official
conscience
grew
a
little
restless
and
a
few
years
ago
in
april
massachusetts
actually
made
atonement
for
its
rash
act
the
original
papers
yellow
faded
and
crumbling
were
taken
from
their
pigeonhole
tomb
and
by
an
ordinary
motion
made
seconded
and
adopted
the
order
of
banishment
was
solemnly
annulled
and
repealed
and
made
of
no
effect
whatever
the
ban
under
which
roger
williams
had
lain
for
over
years
was
lifted
and
there
is
no
reason
now
according
to
law
why
roger
williams
can
not
enter
the
state
of
massachusetts
and
reside
therein
the
action
was
to
the
credit
and
honor
of
the
state
it
was
right
in
its
spirit
and
roger
being
in
the
spirit
for
more
than
two
centuries
may
have
smiled
gently
and
understood
but
the
reparation
was
the
mistakes
the
sin
and
folly
of
one
age
may
be
partially
atoned
for
by
a
succeeding
age
but
the
individual
stands
alone
for
what
we
do
and
for
what
we
leave
undone
we
alone
are
responsible
if
we
permit
the
golden
hours
that
might
be
consecrated
to
higher
things
to
trickle
like
sand
through
our
fingers
no
one
can
ever
restore
them
to
us
human
affection
is
fed
by
signs
and
tokens
of
that
affection
merely
having
kindly
feelings
is
not
enough
they
should
be
made
manifest
in
action
the
parched
earth
is
not
refreshed
by
the
mere
fact
of
water
in
the
clouds
it
is
only
when
the
blessing
of
rain
actually
descends
that
it
awakens
to
new
life
we
are
so
ready
to
say
he
knows
how
much
i
think
of
him
and
to
assume
that
as
a
fitting
substitute
for
expression
we
may
know
that
the
sun
is
shining
somewhere
and
still
shiver
for
lack
of
its
glow
and
warmth
love
should
be
constantly
made
evident
in
little
acts
of
thoughtfulness
words
of
sweetness
and
appreciation
smiles
and
handclasps
of
esteem
it
should
be
shown
to
be
a
loving
reality
instead
of
a
memory
by
patience
forbearance
courtesy
and
kindness
this
theory
of
presumed
confidence
in
the
persistence
of
affection
is
one
of
the
sad
phases
of
married
life
we
should
have
roses
of
love
perfume
instead
of
dried
roses
pressed
in
the
family
bible
merely
for
reference
as
a
memorial
of
what
was
instead
of
guarantee
of
what
is
matrimony
too
often
shuts
the
door
of
life
and
leaves
sentiment
consideration
and
chivalry
on
the
outside
the
feeling
may
possibly
be
still
alive
but
it
does
not
reveal
itself
rightly
the
rhymed
poetry
of
loving
has
changed
to
blank
verse
and
later
into
dull
prose
as
the
boy
said
of
his
father
he
a
christian
but
he
not
working
much
at
it
now
love
without
manifestation
does
not
feed
the
heart
any
more
than
a
locked
feeds
the
body
it
does
not
illuminate
and
brighten
the
round
of
daily
duties
any
more
than
an
unlit
lamp
lightens
a
room
there
is
often
such
a
craving
in
the
heart
of
a
husband
or
a
wife
for
expression
in
words
of
human
love
and
tenderness
that
they
are
welcomed
no
matter
from
what
source
they
may
come
if
there
were
more
courtships
continued
after
marriage
the
work
of
the
divorce
courts
would
be
greatly
lessened
this
realization
is
often
one
of
the
things
that
come
too
late
there
are
more
people
in
this
world
hungering
for
kindness
sympathy
comradeship
and
love
than
are
hungering
for
bread
we
often
refrain
from
giving
a
hearty
word
of
encouragement
praise
or
congratulation
to
some
one
even
where
we
recognize
that
our
feelings
are
known
for
fear
of
making
him
conceited
or
overconfident
let
us
tear
down
these
dykes
of
reserve
these
walls
of
petty
repression
and
let
in
the
flood
of
our
feelings
there
have
been
few
monuments
reared
to
the
memory
of
those
who
have
failed
in
life
because
of
overpraise
there
is
more
chiseled
flattery
on
tombstones
than
was
ever
heard
in
life
by
the
dead
those
stones
now
guard
man
does
not
ask
for
flattery
he
does
not
long
for
fulsome
praise
he
wants
the
honest
ringing
sound
of
recognition
of
what
he
has
done
fair
appreciation
of
what
he
is
doing
and
sympathy
with
what
he
is
striving
to
do
why
is
it
that
death
makes
us
suddenly
conscious
of
a
hundred
virtues
in
a
man
who
seemed
commonplace
and
faulty
in
life
then
we
speak
as
though
an
angel
had
been
living
in
our
town
for
years
and
we
had
suddenly
discovered
him
if
he
could
only
have
heard
these
words
while
living
if
he
could
have
discounted
the
eulogies
at
say
even
sixty
per
cent
they
would
have
been
an
inspiration
to
him
when
weary
worn
and
worried
by
the
problems
of
living
but
now
the
ears
are
stilled
to
all
earthly
music
and
even
if
they
could
hear
our
praise
the
words
would
be
but
useless
messengers
of
love
that
came
too
late
it
is
right
to
speak
well
of
the
dead
to
remember
their
strength
and
to
forget
their
weakness
and
to
render
to
their
memory
the
expressions
of
honor
justice
love
and
sorrow
that
fill
our
hearts
but
it
is
the
living
ever
the
living
that
need
it
most
the
dead
have
passed
beyond
the
helpfulness
our
wildest
cries
of
agony
and
regret
bring
no
answering
echo
from
the
silences
of
the
unknown
those
who
are
facing
the
battle
of
life
still
seeking
bravely
to
do
and
to
be
need
our
help
our
companionship
our
love
all
that
is
best
in
us
better
is
the
smallest
flower
placed
in
our
warm
living
hands
than
mountains
of
roses
banked
round
our
casket
if
we
have
failed
in
our
expressions
to
the
dead
the
deep
sense
of
our
sorrow
and
the
instinctive
rush
of
feeling
proclaim
the
vacuum
of
duty
we
now
seek
too
late
to
fill
but
there
is
one
atonement
that
is
not
too
late
it
is
in
making
all
humanity
legatees
of
the
kindness
and
human
love
that
we
regret
has
been
unexpended
it
is
in
bringing
brightness
courage
and
cheer
into
the
lives
of
those
around
us
thus
our
regret
will
be
shown
to
be
genuine
not
a
mere
temporary
gush
of
emotionalism
it
is
during
the
formative
period
the
time
when
a
man
is
seeking
to
get
a
foothold
that
help
counts
for
most
when
even
the
slightest
aid
is
great
a
few
books
lent
to
andrew
carnegie
when
he
was
beginning
his
career
were
to
him
an
inspiration
he
has
nobly
repaid
the
loan
made
posterity
his
debtor
a
by
his
beneficence
in
sprinkling
libraries
over
the
whole
country
help
the
saplings
the
young
growing
trees
of
vigor
mighty
oaks
have
no
need
of
your
aid
the
heartening
words
should
come
when
needed
not
when
they
seem
only
hypocritic
protestations
or
dextrous
preparations
for
future
favors
columbus
surrounded
by
his
mutinous
crew
threatening
to
kill
him
alone
amid
the
crowd
had
no
one
to
stand
by
him
but
he
neared
land
and
riches
opened
before
them
then
they
fell
at
his
feet
proclaimed
him
almost
a
god
and
said
he
truly
was
inspired
from
heaven
success
transfigured
long
line
of
pebbly
beach
and
a
few
trees
made
him
divine
a
little
patience
along
the
way
a
little
closer
companionship
a
little
brotherly
love
in
his
hours
of
watching
waiting
and
hoping
would
have
been
great
balm
to
his
soul
it
is
in
childhood
that
pleasures
count
most
when
the
slightest
investment
of
kindness
brings
largest
returns
let
us
give
the
children
sunlight
love
companionship
sympathy
with
their
little
troubles
and
worries
that
seem
to
them
so
great
genuine
interest
in
their
growing
hopes
their
vague
unproportioned
dreams
and
yearnings
let
us
put
ourselves
into
their
places
view
the
world
through
their
eyes
so
that
we
may
gently
correct
the
errors
of
their
perspective
by
our
greater
wisdom
such
trifles
will
make
them
genuinely
happy
happier
by
far
than
things
a
thousand
times
greater
that
come
too
late
procrastination
is
the
father
of
a
countless
family
of
things
that
come
too
late
procrastination
means
making
an
appointment
with
opportunity
to
call
again
it
kills
saps
mental
energy
makes
man
a
creature
of
circumstances
instead
of
their
creator
there
is
one
brand
of
procrastination
that
is
a
virtue
it
is
never
doing
a
wrong
that
can
be
put
off
till
never
performing
an
act
that
may
make
ashamed
there
are
little
estrangements
in
life
little
misunderstandings
that
are
passed
by
in
silence
between
friends
each
too
closely
armored
with
pride
and
enamoured
with
self
to
break
there
is
a
time
when
a
few
straightforward
words
would
set
it
all
right
the
clouds
would
break
and
the
sunshine
of
love
burst
forth
again
but
each
nurses
a
weak
petty
sense
of
dignity
the
rift
grows
wider
they
drift
apart
and
each
goes
his
lonely
way
hungering
for
the
other
they
may
waken
to
realization
too
late
to
piece
the
broken
strands
of
affection
into
a
new
life
the
wisdom
that
comes
too
late
in
a
thousand
phases
of
life
usually
has
an
irritating
depressing
effect
on
the
individual
he
should
charge
a
large
part
of
it
to
the
account
of
experience
if
no
wisdom
came
too
late
there
would
be
no
experience
it
means
after
all
only
that
we
are
wiser
than
we
were
yesterday
that
we
see
all
things
in
truer
relation
that
our
pathway
of
life
has
been
illuminated
the
world
is
prone
to
judge
by
results
it
is
glad
to
be
a
stockholder
in
our
success
and
prosperity
but
it
too
often
avoids
the
assessments
of
sympathy
and
understanding
the
man
who
pulls
against
the
stream
may
have
but
a
stanch
two
or
three
to
help
him
when
the
tide
turns
and
his
craft
swiftens
its
course
and
he
is
carried
along
without
effort
he
finds
boats
hurrying
to
him
from
all
directions
as
if
he
had
suddenly
woke
up
and
found
himself
in
a
regatta
the
help
then
comes
too
late
he
does
not
need
it
he
himself
must
then
guard
against
the
temptation
of
cynicism
and
coldness
and
selfishness
then
he
should
realize
and
determine
that
what
he
terms
the
way
of
the
world
shall
not
be
his
way
that
he
will
not
be
too
late
with
his
stimulus
to
others
who
have
struggled
bravely
as
he
has
done
but
who
being
less
strong
may
drop
the
oars
in
despair
for
the
lack
of
the
stimulus
of
even
a
friendly
word
of
heartening
in
a
crisis
the
old
song
of
dreary
philosophy
says
the
mill
will
never
grind
again
with
the
water
that
is
past
why
should
the
mill
expect
to
use
the
same
water
over
and
over
that
water
may
now
be
merrily
turning
further
down
the
valley
continuing
without
ceasing
its
good
work
it
is
folly
to
think
so
much
of
the
water
that
is
past
think
more
of
the
great
stream
that
is
ever
flowing
on
use
that
as
best
you
can
and
when
it
has
passed
you
will
be
glad
that
it
came
and
be
satisfied
with
its
service
time
is
a
mighty
stream
that
comes
each
day
with
unending
flow
to
think
of
this
water
of
past
time
with
such
regret
that
it
shuts
our
eyes
to
the
mighty
river
of
the
present
is
sheer
folly
let
us
make
the
best
we
can
of
in
the
best
preparation
for
then
even
the
things
that
come
too
late
will
be
new
revelations
of
wisdom
to
use
in
the
present
now
before
us
and
in
the
future
we
are
forming
the
way
of
the
reformer
the
way
of
the
reformer
the
reformers
of
the
world
are
its
men
of
mighty
purpose
they
are
men
with
the
courage
of
individual
conviction
men
who
dare
run
counter
to
the
criticism
of
inferiors
men
who
voluntarily
bear
crosses
for
what
they
accept
as
right
even
without
the
guarantee
of
a
crown
they
are
men
who
gladly
go
down
into
the
depths
of
silence
darkness
and
oblivion
but
only
to
emerge
finally
like
divers
with
pearls
in
their
hands
he
who
labors
untiringly
toward
the
attainment
of
some
noble
aim
with
eyes
fixed
on
the
star
of
some
mighty
purpose
as
the
magi
followed
the
star
in
the
east
is
a
reformer
he
who
is
loyal
to
the
inspiration
of
some
great
religious
thought
and
with
strong
hand
leads
weak
trembling
steps
of
faith
into
the
glory
of
certainty
is
a
reformer
he
who
follows
the
thin
thread
of
some
revelation
of
nature
in
any
of
the
sciences
follows
it
in
the
spirit
of
truth
through
a
maze
of
doubt
hope
experiment
and
questioning
till
the
tiny
guiding
thread
grows
stronger
and
firmer
to
his
touch
leading
him
to
some
wondrous
illumination
of
nature
law
is
a
reformer
he
who
goes
up
alone
into
the
mountains
of
truth
and
glowing
with
the
radiance
of
some
mighty
revelation
returns
to
force
the
hurrying
world
to
listen
to
his
story
is
a
reformer
whoever
seeks
to
work
out
for
himself
his
destiny
the
that
all
his
nature
tells
him
should
be
his
bravely
calmly
and
with
due
consideration
of
the
rights
of
others
and
his
duties
to
them
is
a
reformer
these
men
who
renounce
the
commonplace
and
conventional
for
higher
things
are
reformers
because
they
are
striving
to
bring
about
new
conditions
they
are
consecrating
their
lives
to
ideals
they
are
the
brave
aggressive
vanguard
of
progress
they
are
men
who
can
stand
a
siege
who
can
take
long
forced
marches
without
a
murmur
who
set
their
teeth
and
bow
their
heads
as
they
fight
their
way
through
the
smoke
who
smile
at
the
trials
and
privations
that
dare
to
daunt
them
they
care
naught
for
the
hardships
and
perils
of
the
fight
for
they
are
ever
inspired
by
the
flag
of
triumph
that
seems
already
waving
on
the
citadel
of
their
hopes
if
we
are
facing
some
great
life
ambition
let
us
see
if
our
heroic
plans
are
good
high
noble
and
exalted
enough
for
the
price
we
must
pay
for
their
attainment
let
us
seriously
and
honestly
look
into
our
needs
our
abilities
our
resources
our
responsibilities
to
assure
ourselves
that
it
is
no
mere
passing
whim
that
is
leading
us
let
us
hear
and
consider
all
counsel
all
light
that
may
be
thrown
on
every
side
let
us
hear
it
as
a
judge
on
the
bench
listens
to
the
evidence
and
then
makes
his
own
decision
the
choice
of
a
is
too
sacred
a
responsibility
to
the
individual
to
be
lightly
decided
for
him
by
others
less
thoroughly
informed
than
himself
when
we
have
weighed
in
the
balance
the
mighty
question
and
have
made
our
decision
let
us
act
let
us
concentrate
our
lives
upon
that
which
we
feel
is
supreme
and
never
forsaking
a
real
duty
never
be
diverted
from
the
attainment
of
the
highest
things
no
matter
what
honest
price
we
may
have
to
pay
for
their
realization
and
conquest
when
nature
decides
on
any
man
as
a
reformer
she
whispers
to
him
his
great
message
she
places
in
his
hand
the
staff
of
courage
she
wraps
around
him
the
robes
of
patience
and
and
starts
him
on
his
way
then
in
order
that
he
may
have
strength
to
live
through
it
all
she
mercifully
calls
him
back
for
a
moment
and
makes
optimist
the
way
of
the
reformer
is
hard
very
hard
the
world
knows
little
of
it
for
it
is
rare
that
the
reformer
reveals
the
scars
of
conflict
the
pangs
of
hope
deferred
the
mighty
waves
of
despair
that
wash
over
a
great
purpose
sometimes
men
of
sincere
aim
and
unselfish
high
ambition
weary
and
worn
with
the
struggle
have
permitted
the
world
to
hear
an
uncontrolled
sob
of
hopelessness
or
a
word
of
momentary
bitterness
at
the
seeming
emptiness
of
all
effort
but
men
of
great
purpose
and
noble
ideals
must
know
that
the
path
of
the
reformer
is
loneliness
they
must
live
from
within
rather
than
in
dependence
on
sources
of
help
from
without
their
mission
their
exalted
aim
their
supreme
object
in
living
which
focuses
all
their
energy
must
be
their
source
of
strength
and
inspiration
the
reformer
must
ever
light
the
torch
of
his
own
inspiration
his
own
hand
must
ever
guard
the
sacred
flame
as
he
moves
steadily
forward
on
his
lonely
way
the
reformer
in
morals
in
education
in
religion
in
sociology
in
invention
in
philosophy
in
any
line
of
aspiration
is
ever
a
pioneer
his
privilege
is
to
blaze
the
path
for
others
to
mark
at
his
peril
a
road
that
others
may
follow
in
safety
he
must
not
expect
that
the
way
will
be
graded
and
asphalted
for
him
he
must
realize
that
he
must
face
injustice
ingratitude
opposition
misunderstanding
the
cruel
criticism
of
contemporaries
and
often
hardest
of
all
the
wondering
reproach
of
those
who
love
him
best
he
must
not
expect
the
tortoise
to
sympathize
with
the
flight
of
the
eagle
a
great
purpose
is
ever
an
isolation
should
a
soldier
leading
the
forlorn
hope
complain
that
the
army
is
not
abreast
of
him
the
glorious
opportunity
before
him
should
so
inspire
him
so
absorb
him
that
he
will
care
naught
for
the
army
except
to
know
that
if
he
lead
as
he
should
and
do
that
which
the
crisis
demands
the
army
follow
the
reformer
must
realize
without
a
trace
of
bitterness
that
the
busy
world
cares
little
for
his
struggles
it
cares
only
to
joy
in
his
final
triumph
it
will
share
his
feasts
but
not
his
fasts
christ
was
alone
in
gethsemane
the
sermon
in
the
wilderness
where
food
was
provided
the
attendance
was
four
thousand
the
world
is
honest
enough
in
its
attitude
it
takes
time
for
the
world
to
realize
to
accept
and
to
assimilate
a
large
truth
since
the
dawn
of
history
the
great
conservative
spirit
of
every
age
that
ballast
that
keeps
the
world
in
poise
makes
the
slow
acceptance
of
great
truths
an
essential
for
its
safety
it
wisely
requires
proof
clear
absolute
undeniable
attestation
before
it
fully
accepts
sometimes
the
perfect
enlightenment
takes
years
sometimes
generations
it
is
but
the
safeguard
of
truth
time
is
the
supreme
test
the
final
court
of
appeals
that
winnows
out
the
chaff
of
false
claims
pretended
revelation
empty
boast
and
idle
dreams
time
is
the
touchstone
that
finally
reveals
all
true
gold
the
process
is
slow
necessarily
so
and
the
fate
of
the
world
geniuses
and
reformers
in
the
balance
of
their
contemporary
criticism
should
have
a
sweetness
of
consolation
rather
than
the
bitterness
of
cynicism
if
the
greatest
leaders
of
the
world
have
had
to
wait
for
recognition
should
we
whose
best
work
may
be
but
trifling
in
comparison
with
theirs
expect
instant
sympathy
appreciation
and
coöperation
where
we
are
merely
growing
toward
our
own
attainment
the
world
ever
says
to
its
leaders
by
its
attitude
if
not
in
words
if
you
would
lead
us
to
higher
realms
of
thought
to
purer
ideals
of
life
and
flash
before
us
like
the
handwriting
on
the
wall
all
the
possible
glories
of
development
must
pay
the
price
for
it
not
we
the
world
has
a
law
as
clearly
defined
as
the
laws
of
kepler
contemporary
credit
for
reform
works
in
any
line
will
be
in
inverse
proportion
to
the
square
root
of
their
importance
give
us
a
new
fad
and
we
will
prostrate
ourselves
in
the
dust
give
us
a
new
philosophy
a
marvelous
revelation
a
higher
conception
of
life
and
morality
and
we
may
pass
you
by
but
posterity
will
pay
for
it
send
your
messages
and
posterity
will
settle
for
them
you
ask
for
bread
posterity
will
give
you
a
stone
called
a
monument
there
is
nothing
in
this
to
discourage
the
highest
efforts
of
genius
genius
is
great
because
it
is
decades
in
advance
of
its
generation
to
appreciate
genius
requires
comprehension
and
the
same
characteristics
the
public
can
fully
appreciate
only
what
is
a
few
steps
in
advance
it
must
grow
to
the
appreciation
of
great
thought
the
genius
or
the
reformer
should
accept
this
as
a
necessary
condition
it
is
the
price
he
must
pay
for
being
in
advance
of
his
generation
just
as
front
seats
in
the
orchestra
cost
more
than
those
in
the
back
row
of
the
third
gallery
the
world
is
impartial
in
its
methods
it
says
ever
you
may
suffer
now
but
we
will
give
you
later
fame
posthumous
fame
means
that
the
individual
may
shiver
with
cold
but
his
grandchildren
will
get
ulsters
the
individual
plants
acorns
his
posterity
sells
the
oaks
posthumous
fame
or
recognition
is
a
check
made
out
to
the
individual
but
payable
only
to
his
heirs
there
is
nothing
the
world
cries
out
for
so
constantly
as
a
new
idea
there
is
nothing
the
world
fears
so
much
the
milestones
of
progress
in
the
history
of
the
ages
tell
the
story
galileo
was
cast
into
prison
in
his
seventieth
year
and
his
works
were
prohibited
he
had
committed
no
crime
but
he
was
in
advance
of
his
generation
harvey
discovery
of
the
circulation
of
the
blood
was
not
accepted
by
the
universities
of
the
world
till
years
after
its
publication
frœbel
the
gentle
inspired
lover
of
children
suffered
the
trials
and
struggles
of
the
reformer
and
his
system
of
teaching
was
abolished
in
prussia
because
it
was
calculated
to
bring
up
our
young
people
in
atheism
so
it
was
with
thousands
of
others
the
world
says
with
a
large
airy
sweep
of
the
hand
the
opposition
to
progress
is
all
in
the
past
the
great
reformer
or
the
great
genius
is
recognized
no
in
the
past
they
tried
to
kill
a
great
truth
by
opposition
now
we
gently
seek
to
smother
it
by
making
it
a
fad
so
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
human
nature
the
saviours
of
the
world
must
ever
be
martyrs
the
death
of
christ
on
the
cross
for
the
people
he
had
come
to
save
typifies
the
temporary
crucifixion
of
public
opinion
that
comes
to
all
who
bring
to
the
people
the
message
of
some
great
truth
some
clearer
revelation
of
the
divine
truth
right
and
justice
must
triumph
let
us
never
close
the
books
of
a
great
work
and
say
it
has
failed
no
matter
how
slight
seem
results
how
dark
the
outlook
the
glorious
consummation
of
the
past
the
revelation
of
the
future
come
and
christ
lived
thirty
years
and
he
had
twelve
disciples
one
denied
him
one
doubted
him
one
betrayed
him
and
the
other
nine
were
very
human
and
in
the
supreme
crisis
of
his
life
they
forsook
him
and
fled
but
followers
are
millions
sweet
indeed
is
human
sympathy
the
warm
of
confidence
and
love
brings
a
rich
inflow
of
new
strength
to
him
who
is
struggling
and
the
knowledge
that
someone
dear
to
us
sees
with
love
and
comradeship
our
future
through
our
eyes
is
a
wondrous
draught
of
new
life
if
we
have
this
perhaps
the
loyalty
of
two
or
three
what
the
world
says
or
thinks
about
us
should
count
for
little
but
if
this
be
denied
us
then
must
we
bravely
walk
our
weary
way
alone
toward
the
sunrise
that
must
come
the
little
world
around
us
that
does
not
understand
us
does
not
appreciate
our
ambition
or
sympathize
with
our
efforts
that
seem
to
it
futile
is
not
intentionally
cruel
calloused
bitter
blind
or
heartless
it
is
merely
that
busied
with
its
own
pursuits
problems
and
pleasures
it
does
not
fully
realize
does
not
see
as
we
do
the
world
does
not
see
our
ideal
as
we
see
it
does
not
feel
the
glow
of
inspiration
that
makes
our
blood
tingle
our
eye
brighten
and
our
soul
seem
flooded
with
a
wondrous
light
it
sees
naught
but
the
rough
block
of
marble
before
us
and
the
great
mass
of
chips
and
fragments
of
seemingly
fruitless
effort
at
our
feet
but
it
does
not
see
the
angel
of
achievement
slowly
emerging
from
its
stone
prison
from
nothingness
into
being
under
the
tireless
strokes
of
our
chisel
it
hears
no
faint
rustle
of
wings
that
seem
already
real
to
us
nor
the
glory
of
the
music
of
triumph
already
ringing
in
our
ears
there
come
dark
dreary
days
in
all
great
work
when
effort
seems
useless
when
hope
almost
appears
a
delusion
and
confidence
the
mirage
of
folly
sometimes
for
days
your
sails
flap
idly
against
the
mast
with
not
a
breath
of
wind
to
move
you
on
your
way
and
with
a
paralyzing
sense
of
helplessness
you
just
have
to
sit
and
wait
and
wait
sometimes
your
craft
of
hope
is
carried
back
by
a
tide
that
seems
to
undo
in
moments
your
work
of
months
but
it
may
not
be
really
so
you
maybe
put
into
a
new
channel
that
brings
you
nearer
your
haven
than
you
dared
to
hope
this
is
the
hour
that
tests
us
that
determines
whether
we
are
masters
or
slaves
of
conditions
as
in
battle
of
marengo
it
is
the
fight
that
is
made
when
all
seems
lost
that
really
counts
and
wrests
victory
from
the
hand
of
seeming
defeat
if
you
are
seeking
to
accomplish
any
great
serious
purpose
that
your
mind
and
your
heart
tell
you
is
right
you
must
have
the
spirit
of
the
reformer
you
must
have
the
courage
to
face
trial
sorrow
and
disappointment
to
meet
them
squarely
and
to
move
forward
unscathed
and
undaunted
in
the
sublimity
of
your
perfect
faith
in
the
outcome
you
can
make
them
as
powerless
to
harm
you
as
a
dewdrop
falling
on
the
pyramids
truth
with
time
as
its
ally
always
wins
in
the
end
the
knowledge
of
the
inappreciation
the
coldness
and
the
indifference
of
the
world
should
never
make
you
pessimistic
they
should
inspire
you
with
that
large
broad
optimism
that
sees
that
all
the
opposition
of
the
world
can
never
keep
back
the
triumph
of
truth
that
your
work
is
so
great
that
the
petty
jealousies
misrepresentations
and
hardships
caused
by
those
around
you
dwindle
into
nothingness
what
cares
the
messenger
of
the
king
for
his
trials
and
sufferings
if
he
knows
that
he
has
delivered
his
message
large
movements
great
plans
always
take
time
for
development
if
you
want
great
things
pay
the
price
like
a
man
any
one
can
plant
radishes
it
takes
courage
to
plant
acorns
and
to
wait
for
the
oaks
learn
to
look
not
merely
the
clouds
but
through
them
to
the
sun
shining
behind
them
when
things
look
darkest
grasp
your
weapon
firmer
and
fight
harder
there
is
always
more
progress
than
you
can
perceive
and
it
is
really
only
the
outcome
of
the
battle
that
counts
and
when
it
is
all
over
and
the
victory
is
yours
and
the
smoke
clears
away
and
the
smell
of
the
powder
is
dissipated
and
you
bury
the
friendships
that
died
because
they
could
not
stand
the
strain
and
you
nurse
back
the
wounded
and
who
loyally
stood
by
you
even
when
doubting
then
the
hard
years
of
fighting
will
seem
but
a
dream
you
will
stand
brave
heartened
strengthened
by
the
struggle
to
a
new
better
and
stronger
life
by
a
noble
battle
nobly
waged
in
a
noble
cause
and
the
price
will
then
seem
to
transcriber
note
obvious
typographical
errors
have
been
silently
corrected
variations
in
hyphenation
have
been
standardised
but
all
other
spelling
and
punctuation
remains
unchanged
