preface
the
plan
of
the
revision
of
mcguffey
fifth
reader
is
the
same
as
that
pursued
in
the
other
books
of
the
revised
series
the
book
has
been
considerably
enlarged
but
the
new
pieces
have
been
added
or
substituted
only
after
the
most
careful
consideration
and
where
the
advantages
to
be
derived
were
assured
it
has
been
the
object
to
obtain
as
wide
a
range
of
leading
authors
as
possible
to
present
the
best
specimens
of
style
to
insure
interest
in
the
subjects
to
impart
valuable
information
and
to
exert
a
decided
and
healthful
moral
influence
thus
the
essential
characteristics
of
mcguffey
readers
have
been
carefully
kept
intact
the
preliminary
exercises
have
been
retained
and
are
amply
sufficient
for
drill
in
articulation
inflection
etc
the
additional
exercises
on
these
subjects
formerly
inserted
between
the
lessons
have
been
omitted
to
make
room
for
other
valuable
features
of
the
revised
series
a
full
understanding
of
the
text
is
necessary
in
order
to
read
it
properly
as
all
the
books
of
reference
required
for
this
purpose
are
not
within
the
reach
of
the
majority
of
pupils
full
explanatory
notes
have
been
given
which
it
is
believed
will
add
greatly
not
only
to
the
interest
of
the
reading
lessons
but
also
to
their
usefulness
from
an
instructive
point
of
view
the
definitions
of
the
more
difficult
words
have
been
given
as
formerly
and
the
pronunciation
has
been
indicated
by
diacritical
marks
in
conformity
with
the
preceding
books
of
the
revised
series
particular
attention
is
invited
to
the
notices
of
authors
comparatively
few
pupils
have
the
opportunity
of
making
a
separate
study
of
english
and
american
literature
and
the
carefully
prepared
notices
in
the
revised
series
are
designed
therefore
to
supply
as
much
information
in
regard
to
the
leading
authors
as
is
possible
in
the
necessarily
limited
space
assigned
the
publishers
have
desired
to
illustrate
mcguffey
readers
in
a
manner
worthy
of
the
text
and
of
the
high
favor
in
which
they
are
held
throughout
the
united
states
the
most
celebrated
designers
and
engravers
of
the
country
have
been
employed
for
this
purpose
it
has
been
the
privilege
of
the
publishers
to
submit
the
revisied
series
to
numerous
eminent
educators
in
all
parts
of
the
country
to
the
careful
reviews
and
criticisms
of
these
gentlemen
is
due
in
a
large
measure
the
present
form
of
mcguffey
readers
the
value
of
these
criticisms
coming
from
practical
sources
of
the
highest
authority
can
not
well
be
overestimated
and
the
publishers
take
this
occasion
to
express
their
thanks
and
their
indebtedness
to
all
who
have
thus
kindly
assisted
them
in
this
work
especial
acknowledgment
is
due
to
houghton

for
their
permission

introduction
preliminary
remarks
the
great
object
to
be
accomplished
in
reading
as
a
rhetorical
exercise
is
to
convey
to
the
hearer
fully
and
clearly
the
ideas
and
feelings
of
the
writer
in
order
to
do
this
it
is
necessary
that
a
selection
should
be
carefully
studied
by
the
pupil
before
he
attempts
to
read
it
in
accordance
with
this
view
a
preliminary
rule
of
importance
is
the
following
rule
before
attempting
to
read
a
lesson
the
learner
should
make
himself
fully
acquainted
with
the
subject
as
treated
of
in
that
lesson
and
endeavor
to
make
the
thought
and
feeling
and
sentiments
of
the
writer
his
own
when
he
has
thus
identified
himself
with
the
author
he
has
the
substance
of
all
rules
in
his
own
mind
it
is
by
going
to
nature
that
we
find
rules
the
child
or
the
savage
orator
never
mistakes
in
inflection
or
emphasis
or
modulation
the
best
speakers
and
readers
are
those
who
follow
the
impulse
of
nature
or
most
closely
imitate
it
as
observed
in
others
ii
articulation
articulation
is
the
utterance
of
the
elementary
sounds
of
a
language
and
of
their
combinations
an
elementary
sound
is
a
simple
distinct
sound
made
by
the
organs
of
speech
the
elementary
sounds
of
the
english
language
are
divided
into
vocals
subvocals
and
aspirates
elementary
vocals
vocals
are
sounds
which
consist
of
pure
tone
only
a
diphthong
is
a
union
of
two
vocals
commencing
with
one
and
ending
with
the
other
put
the
lips
teeth
tongue
and
palate
in
their
proper
position
pronounce
the
word
in
the
chart
forcibly
and
with
the
falling
inflection
several
times
in
succession
then
drop
the
subvocal
or
aspirate
sounds
which
precede
or
follow
the
vocal
and

are

or
quite
the
same
in
quality
as
certain
of
the
long
sounds
the
difference
consists
chiefly
in
quantity
remark
the
vocals
are
often
represented
by
other
letters
or
combinations
of
letters
than
those
used
in
the
table
for
instance
a

represented
by
ai
in

ea

etc
remark
as
a
general
rule
the
long
vocals
and
the
diphthongs
should
be
articulated
with
a
full
clear
utterance
but
the
short
vocals
have
a
sharp
distinct
and
almost
explosive
utterance
subvocals
and
aspirates
subvocals
are
those
sounds
in
which
the
vocalized
breath
is
more
or
less
obstructed
aspirates
consist
of
breath
only
modified
by
the
vocal
organs
words
ending
with
subvocal
sounds
should
be
selected
for
practice
on
the
subvocals
words
beginning
or
ending
with
aspirate
sounds
may
be
used
for
practice
on
the
aspirates
pronounce
these
words
forcibly
and
distinctly
several
times
in
succession
then
drop
the
other
sounds
and

the
subvocals
and
aspirates

words

these

the

are
put
in
the
position
required
in
the
articulation
of
the
corresponding
subvocals
but
the
breath
is
expelled
with
some
force
without
the
utterance
of
any
vocal
sound
the
pupil
should
first
verify
this
by
experiment
and
then
practice
on
these
cognates

in

in

it
is
very
important
to
avoid
a
fault
which
is
the
natural
consequence
of
an
effort
to
articulate
correctly
thus
in
endeavoring
to
sound
correctly
the
a
in
the
pupil
is
very
apt
to
say
accenting
the
last
syllable
instead
of
the
first
remark
the
teacher
should
bear
it
in
mind
that
in
correcting
a
fault
there
is
always
danger
of
erring
in
the
opposite
extreme
properly
speaking
there
is
no
danger
of
learning
to
articulate
too
distinctly
but
there
is
danger
of
making
the
obscure
sounds
too
prominent
and
of
reading
in

slow

in

they

and
require
care

attention
for
their
utterance
although
after
a
while
it
becomes
a
habit
the
only
remedy
is
to
devote
that
care
and
attention
which
may
be
necessary
there
is
no
other
difficulty

there
should

inflections
inflections
are
slides
of
the
voice
upward
or
downward
of
these
there
are
two
the
rising
inflection
and
the
falling
inflection
the
rising
inflection
is
that
in
which
the
voice
slides
upward
and
is
marked
thus
as
did
you
walk
did
you
walk
the
falling
inflection
is
that
in
which
the
voice
slides
downward
and
is
marked
thus
as
i
did
not
walk
i
did
not
walk
both
inflections
are
exhibited
in
the
following
question
did
you
walk
or
ride
walk
or
ride
in
the
following
examples
the
first
member
has
the
rising
and
the
second
member
the
falling
inflection
examples
is

is
he

or

did
you
say
statute
or

did
he
act
properly
or
improperly
footnote
these
questions
and
similar
ones
with
their
answers
should
be
repeatedly
pronounced
with
their
proper
inflection
until
the

between
the

made

receives
the

exclaims

indeed
in
the
above

the
words

ah
may
be
considered
as
interrogatory

be
in

form
of

as
do
you
ask

you
say

circumflex
the
circumflex
is
a
union
of
the
rising
and
falling
inflections
properly
speaking
there
are
two
of
these
the
one
called
the
rising
circumflex
in
which
the
voice
slides
down
and
then
up
and
the
other
the
falling
circumflex
in
which
the
voice
slides
upward
and
then
downward
on
the
same
vowel
they
may
both
be
denoted
by
the
same
mark
thus
the
circumflex
is
used
chiefly
to
indicate
the
emphasis
of
irony
of
contrast
or
of
hypothesis
examples

your

i
said

o

did
you
say

so
they
shook
hands
and
were

brothers
in
the
first
example
the
emphasis
is
that
of
contrast
the
queen
had
poisoned
her
husband
of
which
she
incorrectly
supposed
her
son
ignorant
and
she
blames
him
for
treating
his
with
disrespect
in
his
reply
hamlet
contrasts
her
deep
crime
with
his
own
slight
offense
and
the
circumflex
upon
you
becomes
proper
in
the
second
example
the
emphasis
is
ironical
the
spaniards
pretended
that
they
would
protect
the
peruvians
if
they
would
submit
to
them
whereas
it
was
evident
that
they
merely
desired
to
plunder
and
destroy
them
thus
their
protection
is
ironically
called
such
protection
as
vultures
give
to
lambs
etc
in
the
third
example
the
word
so
is
used
hypothetically
that
is
it
implies
a
condition
or
supposition
it
will
be
observed
that
the
rising
circumflex
is
used
in
the
first
so
and
the
falling
in
the
second
because
the
first
so
must
end
with
the
rising
inflection
and
the
second
with
the
falling

rules

a
word
is
said
to

when

is
uttered
with
a
greater
stress
of
voice
than
the
other

with
which
it
is

remark
the
object
of
emphasis
is
to
attract
particular
attention
to
the
word
upon
which
it
is
placed
indicating
that
the
idea
to
be
conveyed
depends
very
much
upon
that
word
this
object
as
just
stated
is
generally
accomplished
by
increasing
the
force
of
utterance
but
sometimes
also
by
a
change
in
the
inflection
by
the
use
of
the
monotone
by
pause
or
by
uttering
the
words
in
a
very
low
key
emphatic
words
are
often
denoted
by

words

emphatic
pause
the
emphatic
expression
of
a
sentence
often
requires
a
pause
where
the
grammatical
construction
authorizes
none
this
is
sometimes
called
the
rhetorical
pause
such
pauses
occur
chiefly
before
or
after
an
emphatic
word
or
phrase

sometimes
both
before
and
after
it

modulation
modulation
includes
the
variations
of
the
voice
these
may
be
classed
under
the
heads
of
pitch
compass
quantity
and
quality
pitch
and
compass
if
anyone
will
notice
closely
a
sentence
as
uttered
in
private
conversation
he
will
observe
that
very
few
successive
words
are
pronounced
in
exactly
the
same
key
or
with
the
same
force
at
the
same
time
however
there
is
a
certain
pitch
or
key
which
seems
on
the
whole
to
prevail
this
keynote
or
governing
note
as
it
may
be
called
is
that
upon
which
the
voice
most
frequently
dwells
to
which
it
usually
returns
when
wearied
and
upon
which
a
sentence
generally
commences
and
very
frequently
ends
while
at
the
same
time
there
is
a
considerable
play
of
the
voice
above
and
below
it
this
key
may
be
high
or
low
it
varies
in
different
individuals
and
at
different
times
in
the
same
individual
being
governed
by
the
nature
of
the
subject
and
the
emotions
of
the
speaker
it
is
worthy
of
notice
however
that
most
speakers
pitch
their
voices
on
a
key
too
high
the
range
of
the
voice
above
and
below
this
note
is
called
its
compass
when
the
speaker
is
animated
this
range
is
great
but
upon
abstract
subjects
or
with
a
dull
speaker
it
is
small
if
in
reading
or
speaking
too
high
a
note
be
chosen
the
lungs
will
soon
become
wearied
if
too
low
a
pitch
be
selected
there
is
danger
of
indistinctness
of
utterance
and
in
either
case
there
is
less
room
for
compass
or
variety
of
tone
than
if
one
be
taken
between
the
two
extremes
to
secure
the
proper
pitch
and
the
greatest
compass
observe
the
following
rule
rule
the
reader
or
speaker
should
choose
that
pitch
in
which
he
can
feel
himself
most
at
ease
and
above
and
below
which
he
may
have
most
room
for
variation
remark
having
chosen
the
proper
keynote
he
should
beware
of
confining
himself
to
it
this
constitutes
monotony
one
of
the
greatest
faults
in
elocution
one
very
important
instrument
for
giving
expression
and
life
to
thought
is
thus
lost
and
the
hearer
soon
becomes
wearied
and
disgusted
remark
there
is
another
fault
of
nearly
equal
magnitude
and
of
very
frequent
occurrence
this
consists
in
varying
the
pitch
and
force
without
reference
to
the
sense
a
sentence
is
commenced
with
vehemence
and
in
a
high
key
and
the
voice
gradually
sinks
until
the
breath
being
spent
it
dies
away
in
a
whisper
note
the
power
of
changing
the
key
at
will
is
difficult
to
acquire
but
of
great
importance
remark
the
habit
of
singsong
so
common
in
reading
poetry
as
it
is
a
variation
of
pitch
without
reference
to
the
sense
is
a
species
of
the
fault
above
mentioned
remark
if
the
reader
or
speaker
is
guided
by
the
sense
and
if
he
gives
that
emphasis
inflection
and
expression
required
by
the
meaning
these
faults
speedily
disappear
remark
to
improve
the
voice
in
these
respects
practice
is
necessary
commence
for
example
with
the
lowest
pitch
the
voice
can
comfortably
sound
and
repeat
whole
paragraphs
and
pages
upon
that
key
with
gentle
force
then
repeat
the
paragraph
with
increased
force
taking
care
not
to
raise
the
pitch
then
rise
one
note
higher
and
practice
on
that
then
another
and
so
on
until
the
highest
pitch
of
the
voice
is
reached
reverse
the
process
and
repeat
as
before
until
the
lowest
pitch
is
obtained
in
these
and
all
similar
exercises
be
very
careful
not
to
confound
pitch
and
force
quantity
and
quality
the
tones
of
the
voice
should
vary
also
in
quantity
or
time
required
to
utter
a
sound
or
a
syllable
and
in
quality
or
expression
according
to
the
nature
of
the
subject
we
notice
a
difference
between
the
soft
insinuating
tones
of
persuasion
the
full
strong
voice
of
command
and
decision
the
harsh
irregular
and
sometimes
grating
explosion
of
the
sounds
of
passion
the
plaintive
notes
of
sorrow
and
pity
and
the
equable
and
unimpassioned
flow
of
words
in
argumentative
style
the
following
direction
therefore
is
worthy
of
attention
the
tones
of
the
voice
should
always
correspond
both
in
quantity
and
quality
with
the
nature
of
the
subject
examples

and
grief

in
our
attempt
to
imitate
nature
it
is
important
to
avoid
affectation
for
to
this
fault
even
perfect
monotony
is
preferable
remark
the
strength
of
the
voice
may
be
increased
by
practicing
with
different
degrees
of
loudness
from
a
whisper
to
full
rotundity
taking
care
to
keep
the
voice
on
the
same
key
the
same
note
in
music
may
be
sounded
loud
or
soft
so
also
a
sentence
may
be
pronounced
on
the
same
pitch
with
different
degrees
of
loudness
having
practiced
with
different
degrees
of
loudness
on
one
key
make
the
same
experiment
on
another
and
then
on
another

so
on

poetic
pauses
in
poetry
we
have
in
addition
to
other
pauses
poetic
pauses
the
object
of
these
is
simply
to
promote
the
melody
at
the
end
of
each
line
a
slight
pause
is
proper
whatever
be
the
grammatical
construction
or
the
sense
the
purpose
of
this
pause
is
to
make
prominent
the
melody
of
the
measure
and
in
rhyme
to
allow
the
ear
to
appreciate
the
harmony
of
the
similar
sounds
there
is
also
another
important
pause
somewhere
near
the
middle
of
each
line
which
is
called
the
caesura
or
caesural
pause
in
the
following
lines
it
is
marked
thus
examples
there
are
hours
long
departed
which
memory
brings
like
blossoms
of
eden
to
twine
round
the
heart
and
as
time
rushes
by
on
the
might
of
his
wings
they
may
darken
awhile
but
they
never
depart
the
caesural
pause
should
never
be
so
placed
as
to
injure
the
sense
the
following
lines
if
melody
alone
were
consulted
would
be
read
thus
with
fruitless

strove

this
manner
of

however
would
very
much
interfere
with
the
proper
expression
of
the
idea
this
is
to
be
corrected
by
making
the
caesural
pause
yield
to
the

from
hunting
and
the
glare
of
the
sun
or
some
other
cause
had
so
dazzled
his
eyes
that
he
found
it
difficult
to
make
out
a
single
word
of
the
writing
his
private
secretary
happened
to
be
absent
and
the
soldier
who
brought
the
petition
could
not
read
there
was
a
page
or
favorite
boy
servant
waiting
in
the
hall
and
upon
him
the
king
called
the
page
was
a
son
of
one
of
the
noblemen
of
the
court
but
proved
to
be
a
very
poor
reader
in
the
first
place
he
did
not
articulate
distinctly
he
huddled
his
words
together
in
the
utterance
as
if
they
were
syllables
of
one
long
word
which
he
must
get
through
with
as
speedily
as
possible
his
pronunciation
was
bad
and
he
did
not
modulate
his
voice
so
as
to
bring
out
the
meaning
of
what
he
read
every
sentence
was
uttered
with
a
dismal
monotony
of
voice
as
if
it
did
not
differ
in
any
respect
from
that
which
preceded
it
stop
said
the
king
impatiently
is
it
an
auctioneer
list
of
goods
to
be
sold
that
you
are
hurrying
over
send
your
companion
to
me
another
page
who
stood
at
the
door
now
entered
and
to
him
the
king
gave
the
petition
the
second
page
began
by
hemming
and
clearing
his
throat
in
such
an
affected
manner
that
the
king
jokingly
asked
him
whether
he
had
not
slept
in
the
public
garden
with
the
gate
open
the
night
before
the
second
page
had
a
good
share
of
however
and
so
was
not
greatly
confused
by
the
king
jest
he
determined
that
he
would
avoid
the
mistake
which
his
comrade
had
made
so
he
commenced
reading
the
petition
slowly
and
with
great
formality
emphasizing
every
word
and
prolonging
the
articulation
of
every
syllable
but
his
manner
was
so
tedious
that
the
king
cried
out
stop
are
you
reciting
a
lesson
in
the
elementary
sounds
out
of
the
room
but
no
stay
send
me
that
little
girl
who
is
sitting
there
by
the
fountain
the
girl
thus
pointed
out
by
the
king
was
a
daughter
of
one
of
the
laborers
employed
by
the
royal
gardener
and
she
had
come
to
help
her
father
weed
the
flower
beds
it
chanced
that
like
many
of
the
poor
people
in
prussia
she
had
received
a
good
education
she
was
somewhat
alarmed
when
she
found
herself
in
the
king
presence
but
took
courage
when
the
king
told
her
that
he
only
wanted
her
to
read
for
him
as
his
eyes
were
weak
now
ernestine
for
this
was
the
name
of
the
little
girl
was
fond
of
reading
aloud
and
often
many
of
the
neighbors
would
assemble
at
her
father
house
to
hear
her
those
who
could
not
read
themselves
would
come
to
her
also
with
their
letters
from
distant
friends
or
children
and
she
thus
formed
the
habit
of
reading
various
sorts
of
handwriting
promptly
and
well
the
king
gave
her
the
petition
and
she
rapidly
glanced
through
the
opening
lines
to
get
some
idea
of
what
it
was
about
as
she
read
her
eyes
began
to
glisten
and
her
breast
to
heave
what
is
the
matter
asked
the
king
do
you
know
how
to
read
oh
yes
sire
she
replied
addressing
him
with
the
title
usually
applied
to
him
i
will
now
read
it
if
you
please
the
two
pages
wore
about
to
leave
the
room
remain
said
the
king
the
little
girl
began
to
read
the
petition
it
was
from
a
poor
widow
whose
only
son
had
been
drafted
to
serve
in
the
army
although
his
health
was
delicate
and
his
pursuits
had
been
such
as
to
unfit
him
for
military
life
his
father
had
been
killed
in
battle
and
the
son
had
a
strong
desire
to
become
a
portrait
painter
the
writer
told
her
story
in
a
simple
concise
manner
that
carried
to
the
heart
a
belief
of
its
truth
and
ernestine
read
it
with
so
much
feeling
and
with
an
articulation
so
just
in
tones
so
pure
and
distinct
that
when
she
had
finished
the
king
into
whose
eyes
the
tears
had
started
exclaimed
oh
now
i
understand
what
it
is
all
about
but
i
might
never
have
known
certainly
i
never
should
have
felt
its
meaning
had
i
trusted
to
these
young
gentlemen
whom
i
now
dismiss
from
my
service
for
one
year
advising
them
to
occupy
their
time
in
learning
to
read
as
for
you
my
young
lady
continued
the
king
i
know
you
will
ask
no
better
reward
for
your
trouble
than
the
pleasure
of
carrying
to
this
poor
widow
my
order
for
her
son
immediate
discharge
let
me
see
whether
you
can
write
as
well
as
you
can
read
take
this
pen
and
write
as
i
dictate
he
then
dictated
an
order
which
ernestine
wrote
and
he
signed
calling
one
of
his
guards
he
bade
him
go
with
the
girl
and
see
that
the
order
was
obeyed
how
much
happiness
was
ernestine
the
means
of
bestowing
through
her
good
elocution
united
to
the
happy
circumstance
that
brought
it
to
the
knowledge
of
the
king
first
there
were
her
poor
neighbors
to
whom
she
could
give
instruction
and
entertainment
then
there
was
the
poor
widow
who
sent
the
petition
and
who
not
only
regained
her
son
but
received
through
ernestine
an
order
for
him
to
paint
the
king
likeness
so
that
the
poor
boy
soon
rose
to
great
distinction
and
had
more
orders
than
he
could
attend
to
words
could
not
express
his
gratitude
and
that
of
his
mother
to
the
little
girl
and
ernestine
had
moreover
the
satisfaction
of
aiding
her
father
to
rise
in
the
world
so
that
he
became
the
king
chief
gardener
the
king
did
not
forget
her
but
had
her
well
educated
at
his
own
expense
as
for
the
two
pages
she
was
indirectly
the
means
of
doing
them
good
also
for
ashamed
of
their
bad
reading
they
commenced
studying
in
earnest
till
they
overcame
the
faults
that
had
offended
the
king
both
finally
rose
to
distinction
one
as
a
lawyer
and
the
other
as
a
statesman
and
they
owed
their
advancement
in
life
chiefly
to
their
good
elocution
a
formal
request
to
utter
the
elementary
sounds
to
vary
or
inflect
lack
of
variety
unnatural
and
silly
selected
by
lot
brief
and
full
of
meaning
release
to
utter
so
that
another
may
write
it
down

and
notable
position
to
make
known
the
feelings
of
frederick
ii
of
prussia
b
or
frederick
the
great
as
he
was
called
was
one
of
the
greatest
of
german
rulers
he
was
distinguished
for
his
military
exploits
for
his
wise
and
just
government
and
for
his
literary
attainments
he
wrote
many
able
works
in
the
french
language
many
pleasant
anecdotes
are
told
of
this
king
of
which
the
one
given
in
the
lesson
is
a
fair
sample

there
is
a
story
i
have
heard
a
poet
learned
it
of
a
bird
and
kept
its
music
every
word
a
story
of
a
dim
ravine
which
the
towering
tree
tops
lean
with
one
blue
rift
of
sky
between
and
there
two
thousand
years
ago
a
little
flower
as
white
as
snow
swayed
in
the
silence
to
and
fro
day
after
day
with
longing
eye
the
floweret
watched
the
narrow
sky
and
fleecy
clouds
that
floated
by
and
through
the
darkness
night
by
night
one
gleaming
star
would
climb
the
height
and
cheer
the
lonely
floweret
sight
thus
watching
the
blue
heavens
afar
and
the
rising
of
its
favorite
star
a
slow
change
came
but
not
to
mar
for
softly
its
petals
white
there
crept
a
blueness
like
the
light
of
skies
upon
a
summer
night
and
in
its
chalice
i
am
told
the
bonny
bell
was
formed
to
hold
a
tiny
star
that
gleamed

the
gentle
hand
timothy
arthur
b
was
born
near
newburgh
but
passed
most
of
his
life
at
baltimore
and
philadelphia
his
opportunities
for
good
schooling
were
quite
limited
and
he
may
be
considered
a
man
he
was
the
author
of
more
than
a
hundred
volumes
principally
novels
of
a
domestic
and
moral
tone
and
of
many
shorter
tales
magazine
articles
etc
ten
nights
in
a
barroom
and
three
years
in
a
mantrap
are
among
his
best
known
works
when
and
where
it
matters
not
now
to
relate
but
once
upon
a
time
as
i
was
passing
through
a
thinly
peopled
district
of
country
night
came
down
upon
me
almost
unawares
being
on
foot
i
could
not
hope
to
gain
the
village
toward
which
my
steps
were
directed
until
a
late
hour
and
i
therefore
preferred
seeking
shelter
and
a
night
lodging
at
the
first
humble
dwelling
that
presented
itself
dusky
twilight
was
giving
place
to
deeper
shadows
when
i
found
myself
in
the
vicinity
of
a
dwelling
from
the
small
uncurtained
windows
of
which
the
light
shone
with
a
pleasant
promise
of
good
cheer
and
comfort
the
house
stood
within
an
inclosure
and
a
short
distance
from
the
road
along
which
i
was
moving
with
wearied
feet
turning
aside
and
passing
through
the
gate
i
approached
the
dwelling
slowly
the
gate
swung
on
its
wooden
hinges
and
the
rattle
of
its
latch
in
closing
did
not
disturb
the
air
until
i
had
nearly
reached
the
porch
in
front
of
the
house
in
which
a
slender
girl
who
had
noticed
my
entrance
stood
awaiting
my
arrival
a
deep
quick
bark
answered
almost
like
an
echo
the
sound
of
the
shutting
gate
and
sudden
as
an
apparition
the
form
of
an
immense
dog
loomed
in
the
doorway
at
the
instant
when
he
was
about
to
spring
a
light
hand
was
laid
upon
his
shaggy
neck
and
a
low
word
spoken
go
in
tiger
said
the
girl
not
in
a
voice
of
authority
yet
in
her
gentle
tones
was
the
consciousness
that
she
would
be
obeyed
and
as
she
spoke
she
lightly
bore
upon
the
animal
with
her
hand
and
he
turned
away
and
disappeared
within
the
dwelling
who
that
a
rough
voice
asked
the
question
and
now
a
man
took
the
dog
place
in
the
door
how
far
is
it
to
g
i
asked
not
deeming
it
best
to
say
in
the
beginning
that
i
sought
a
resting
place
for
the
night
to
g
growled
the
man
but
not
so
harshly
as
at
first
it
good
six
miles
from
here
a
long
distance
and
i
a
stranger
and
on
foot
said
i
if
you
can
make
room
for
me
until
morning
i
will
be
very
thankful
i
saw
the
girl
hand
move
quickly
up
his
arm
until
it
rested
on
his
shoulder
and
now
she
leaned
to
him
still
closer
come
in
we
try
what
can
be
done
for
you
there
was
a
change
in
the
man
voice
that
made
me
wonder
i
entered
a
large
room
in
which
blazed
a
brisk
fire
before
the
fire
sat
two
stout
lads
who
turned
upon
me
their
heavy
eyes
with
no
very
welcome
greeting
a
woman
was
standing
at
a
table
and
two
children
were
amusing
themselves
with
a
kitten
on
the
floor
a
stranger
mother
said
the
man
who
had
given
me
so
rude
a
greeting
at
the
door
and
he
wants
us
to
let
him
stay
all
night
the
woman
looked
at
me
doubtingly
for
a
few
moments
and
then
replied
coldly
we
do
keep
a
public
house
i
aware
of
that
said
i
but
night
has
overtaken
me
and
it
a
long
way
yet
to
g
too
far
for
a
tired
man
to
go
on
foot
said
the
master
of
the
house
kindly
so
it
no
use
talking
about
it
mother
we
must
give
him
a
bed
so
unobtrusively
that
i
scarce
noticed
the
movement
the
girl
had
drawn
to
her
mother
side
what
she
said
to
her
i
did
not
hear
for
the
brief
words
were
uttered
in
a
low
voice
but
i
noticed
as
she
spoke
one
small
fair
hand
rested
on
the
woman
hand
was
there
magic
in
that
touch
the
woman
repulsive
aspect
changed
into
one
of
kindly
welcome
and
she
said
yes
it
a
long
way
to
g
i
guess
we
can
find
a
place
for
him
many
times
more
during
that
evening
did
i
observe
the
magic
power
of
that
hand
and
voice
the
one
gentle
yet
potent
as
the
other
on
the
next
morning
breakfast
being
over
i
was
preparing
to
take
my
departure
when
my
host
informed
me
that
if
i
would
wait
for
half
an
hour
he
would
give
me
a
ride
in
his
wagon
to
g
as
business
required
him
to
go
there
i
was
very
well
pleased
to
accept
of
the
invitation
in
due
time
the
farmer
wagon
was
driven
into
the
road
before
the
house
and
i
was
invited
to
get
in
i
noticed
the
horse
as
a
canadian
pony
with
a
certain
air
of
stubborn
endurance
as
the
farmer
took
his
seat
by
my
side
the
family
came
to
the
door
to
see
us
off
dick
said
the
farmer
in
a
peremptory
voice
giving
the
rein
a
quick
jerk
as
he
spoke
but
dick
moved
not
a
step
dick
you
vagabond
get
up
and
the
farmer
whip
cracked
sharply
by
the
pony
ear
it
availed
not
however
this
second
appeal
dick
stood
firmly
disobedient
next
the
whip
was
brought
down
upon
him
with
an
impatient
hand
but
the
pony
only
reared
up
a
little
fast
and
sharp
the
strokes
were
next
dealt
to
the
number
of
half
a
dozen
the
man
might
as
well
have
beaten
the
wagon
for
all
his
end
was
gained
a
stout
lad
now
came
out
into
the
road
and
catching
dick
by
the
bridle
jerked
him
forward
using
at
the
same
time
the
customary
language
on
such
occasions
but
dick
met
this
new
ally
with
increased
stubbornness
planting
his
fore
feet
more
firmly
and
at
a
sharper
angle
with
the
ground
the
impatient
boy
now
struck
the
pony
on
the
side
of
the
head
with
his
clinched
hand
and
jerked
cruelly
at
his
bridle
it
availed
nothing
however
dick
was
not
to
be
wrought
upon
by
any
such
arguments
do
do
so
john
i
turned
my
head
as
the
maiden
sweet
voice
reached
my
ear
she
was
passing
through
the
gate
into
the
road
and
in
the
next
moment
had
taken
hold
of
the
lad
and
drawn
him
away
from
the
animal
no
strength
was
exerted
in
this
she
took
hold
of
his
arm
and
he
obeyed
her
wish
as
readily
as
if
he
had
no
thought
beyond
her
gratification
and
now
that
soft
hand
was
laid
gently
on
the
pony
neck
and
a
single
low
word
spoken
how
instantly
were
the
tense
muscles
relaxed
how
quickly
the
stubborn
air
vanished
poor
dick
said
the
maiden
as
she
stroked
his
neck
lightly
or
softly
patted
it
with
a
childlike
hand
now
go
along
you
provoking
fellow
she
added
in
a
yet
affectionate
voice
as
she
drew
up
the
bridle
the
pony
turned
toward
her
and
rubbed
his
head
against
her
arm
for
an
instant
or
two
then
pricking
up
his
ears
he
started
off
at
a
light
cheerful
trot
and
went
on
his
way
as
freely
as
if
no
silly
crotchet
had
ever
entered
his
stubborn
brain
what
a
wonderful
power
that
hand
possesses
said
i
speaking
to
my
companion
as
we
rode
away
he
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
as
if
my
remark
had
occasioned
surprise
then
a
light
came
into
his
countenance
and
he
said
briefly
she
good
everybody
and
everything
loves
her
was
that
indeed
the
secret
of
her
power
was
the
quality
of
her
soul
perceived
in
the
impression
of
her
hand
even
by
brute
beasts
the
father
explanation
was
doubtless
the
true
one
yet
have
i
ever
since
wondered

iv
the

was
born
in
maine
but
removed
at
an
early
age
to
vermont
where
he
was
connected
with
the
press
at
burlington
woodstock
and
montpelier
he
published
a
volume
of
poems

happy

faithfully
portraying
rural
life
in

the
farmer
sat
in
his
smoking
his
pipe
of
clay
while
his
hale
old
wife
with
busy
care
was
clearing
the
dinner
away
a
sweet
little
girl
with
fine
blue
eyes
on
her
grandfather
knee
was
catching
flies
the
old
man
laid
his
hand
on
her
head
with
a
tear
on
his
wrinkled
face
he
thought
how
often
her
mother
dead
had
sat
in
the
selfsame
place
as
the
tear
stole
down
from
his
eye
do

said
the
child
how
it
makes

the
house
dog
lay
stretched
out
on
the
floor
where
the
shade
afternoons
used
to
steal
the
busy
old
wife
by
the
open
door
was
turning
the
spinning
wheel
and
the
old
brass
clock
on
the
manteltree
had
plodded
along
to
almost
three
still
the
farmer
sat
in
his
while
close
to
his
heaving
breast
the
moistened
brow
and
the
cheek
so
fair
of
his
sweet
grandchild
were
pressed
his
head
bent
down
all
her
soft
hair
lay
fast
asleep
were
they
both
on
that

a
boy
on
a
farm
charles
dudley
warner
b
was
born
at
plainfield
mass
in
he
graduated
at
hamilton
college
and
in
was
admitted
to
the
bar
at
philadelphia
but
moved
to
chicago
to
practice
his
profession
there
he
remained
until
when
he
became
connected
with
the
press
at
hartford
and
has
ever
since
devoted
himself
to
literature
my
summer
in
a
garden
saunterings
and
backlog
studies
are
his
best
known
works
the
following
extract
is
from
being
a
boy
say
what
you
will
about
the
general
usefulness
of
boys
it
is
my
impression
that
a
farm
without
a
boy
would
very
soon
come
to
grief
what
the
boy
does
is
the
life
of
the
farm
he
is
the
factotum
always
in
demand
always
expected
to
do
the
thousand
indispensable
things
that
nobody
else
will
do
upon
him
fall
all
the
odds
and
ends
the
most
difficult
things
after
everybody
else
is
through
he
has
to
finish
up
his
work
is
like
a
woman
perpetually
waiting
on
others
everybody
knows
how
much
easier
it
is
to
eat
a
good
dinner
than
it
is
to
wash
the
dishes
afterwards
consider
what
a
boy
on
a
farm
is
required
to
do
things
that
must
be
done
or
life
would
actually
stop
it
is
understood
in
the
first
place
that
he
is
to
do
all
the
errands
to
go
to
the
store
to
the
post
office
and
to
carry
all
sorts
of
messages
if
he
had
as
many
legs
as
a
centiped
they
would
tire
before
night
his
two
short
limbs
seem
to
him
entirely
inadequate
to
the
task
he
would
like
to
have
as
many
legs
as
a
wheel
has
spokes
and
rotate
about
in
the
same
way
this
he
sometimes
tries
to
do
and
the
people
who
have
seen
him
turning
cart
wheels
along
the
side
of
the
road
have
supposed
that
he
was
amusing
himself
and
idling
his
time
he
was
only
trying
to
invent
a
new
mode
of
locomotion
so
that
he
could
economize
his
legs
and
do
his
errands
with
greater
dispatch
he
practices
standing
on
his
head
in
order
to
accustom
himself
to
any
position
leapfrog
is
one
of
his
methods
of
getting
over
the
ground
quickly
he
would
willingly
go
an
errand
any
distance
if
he
could
leapfrog
it
with
a
few
other
boys
he
has
a
natural
genius
for
combining
pleasure
with
business
this
is
the
reason
why
when
he
is
sent
to
the
spring
for
a
pitcher
of
water
he
is
absent
so
long
for
he
stops
to
poke
the
frog
that
sits
on
the
stone
or
if
there
is
a
penstock
to
put
his
hand
over
the
spout
and
squirt
the
water
a
little
while
he
is
the
one
who
spreads
the
grass
when
the
men
have
cut
it
he
mows
it
away
in
the
barn
he
rides
the
horse
to
cultivate
the
corn
up
and
down
the
hot
weary
rows
he
picks
up
the
potatoes
when
they
are
dug
he
drives
the
cows
night
and
morning
he
brings
wood
and
water
and
splits
kindling
he
gets
up
the
horse
and
puts
out
the
horse
whether
he
is
in
the
house
or
out
of
it
there
is
always
something
for
him
to
do
just
before
the
school
in
winter
he
shovels
paths
in
summer
he
turns
the
grindstone
he
knows
where
there
are
lots
of
wintergreens
and
sweet
flags
but
instead
of
going
for
them
he
is
to
stay
indoors
and
pare
apples
and
stone
raisins
and
pound
something
in
a
mortar
and
yet
with
his
mind
full
of
schemes
of
what
he
would
like
to
do
and
his
hands
full
of
occupations
he
is
an
idle
boy
who
has
nothing
to
busy
himself
with
but
school
and
chores
he
would
gladly
do
all
the
work
if
somebody
else
would
do
the
chores
he
thinks
and
yet
i
doubt
if
any
boy
ever
amounted
to
anything
in
the
world
or
was
of
much
use
as
a
man
who
did
not
enjoy
the
advantages
of
a
liberal
education
in
the
way
of
chores
a
person
employed
to
do
all
kinds
of
work

a

made
a
mistake
she
sang
a
few
notes
out
of
tune
her
heart
was
ready
to
break
and
she
hid
away
from
the
moon
she
wrung
her
claws

thing

was

too
proud
to
weep
she
tucked

pretended

with

sauntering

place

knew
they
had

stood
on

a
small
bird
about
six
inches
in
length
with
a
coat
of
feathers
above
and
of
grayish
white
beneath
its
voice
is

sweet

when
wild
it
usually
sings

evening

vii
do
not
meddle
about
twenty
years
ago
there
lived
a
singular
gentleman
in
the
old
hall
among
the
elm
trees
he
was
about
years
of
age
very
rich
and
somewhat
odd
in
many
of
his
habits
but
for
generosity
and
benevolence
he
had
no
equal
no
poor
cottager
stood
in
need
of
comforts
which
he
was
not
ready
to
supply
no
sick
man
or
woman
languished
for
want
of
his
assistance
and
not
even
a
beggar
unless
a
known
impostor
went
from
the
hall
like
the
village
pastor
described
in
goldsmith
poem
of
the
deserted
village
his
house
was
known
to
all
the
vagrant
train
he
chid
their
but
relieved
their
pain
the
beggar
was
his
guest
whose
beard
descending
swept
his
aged
breast
now
it
happened
that
the
old
gentleman
wanted
a
boy
to
wait
upon
him
at
table
and
to
attend
him
in
different
ways
for
he
was
very
fond
of
young
people
but
much
as
he
liked
the
society
of
the
young
he
had
a
great
aversion
to
that
curiosity
in
which
many
young
people
are
apt
to
indulge
he
used
to
say
the
boy
who
will
peep
into
a
drawer
will
be
tempted
to
take
something
out
of
it
and
he
who
will
steal
a
penny
in
his
youth
will
steal
a
pound
in
his
manhood
no
sooner
was
it
known
that
the
old
gentleman
was
in
want
of
a
boy
than
twenty
applications
were
made
for
the
situation
but
he
determined
not
to
engage
anyone
until
he
had
in
some
way
ascertained
that
he
did
not
possess
a
curious
prying
disposition
on
monday
morning
seven
lads
dressed
in
their
sunday
clothes
with
bright
and
happy
faces
made
their
appearance
at
the
hall
each
of
them
desiring
to
obtain
the
situation
now
the
old
gentleman
being
of
a
singular
disposition
had
prepared
a
room
in
such
a
way
that
he
might
easily
know
if
any
of
the
young
people
who
applied
were
given
to
meddle
unnecessarily
with
things
around
them
or
to
peep
into
cupboards
and
drawers
he
took
care
that
the
lads
who
were
then
at
elm
tree
hall
should
be
shown
into
this
room
one
after
another
and
first
charles
brown
was
sent
into
the
room
and
told
that
he
would
have
to
wait
a
little
so
charles
sat
down
on
a
chair
near
the
door
for
some
time
he
was
very
quiet
and
looked
about
him
but
there
seemed
to
be
so
many
curious
things
in
the
room
that
at
last
he
got
up
to
peep
at
them
on
the
table
was
placed
a
dish
cover
and
charles
wanted
sadly
to
know
what
was
under
it
but
he
felt
afraid
of
lifting
it
up
bad
habits
are
strong
things
and
as
charles
was
of
a
curious
disposition
he
could
not
withstand
the
temptation
of
taking
one
peep
so
he
lifted
up
the
cover
this
turned
out
to
be
a
sad
affair
for
under
the
dish
cover
was
a
heap
of
very
light
feathers
part
of
the
feathers
drawn
up
by
a
current
of
air
flew
about
the
room
and
charles
in
his
fright
putting
the
cover
down
hastily
puffed
the
rest
of
them
off
the
table
what
was
to
be
done
charles
began
to
pick
up
the
feathers
one
by
one
but
the
old
gentleman
who
was
in
an
adjoining
room
hearing
a
scuffle
and
guessing
the
cause
of
it
entered
the
room
to
the
consternation
of
charles
brown
who
was
very
soon
dismissed
as
a
boy
who
had
not
principle
enough
to
resist
even
a
slight
temptation
when
the
room
was
once
more
arranged
henry
wilkins
was
placed
there
until
such
time
as
he
should
be
sent
for
no
sooner
was
he
left
to
himself
than
his
attention
was
attracted
by
a
plate
of
fine
ripe
cherries
now
henry
was
uncommonly
fond
of
cherries
and
he
thought
it
would
be
impossible
to
miss
one
cherry
among
so
many
he
looked
and
longed
and
longed
and
looked
for
some
time
and
just
as
he
had
got
off
his
seat
to
take
one
he
heard
as
he
thought
a
foot
coming
to
the
door
but
no
it
was
a
false
alarm
taking
fresh
courage
he
went
cautiously
and
took
a
very
fine
cherry
for
he
was
determined
to
take
but
one
and
put
it
into
his
mouth
it
was
excellent
and
then
he
persuaded
himself
that
he
ran
no
risk
in
taking
another
this
he
did
and
hastily
popped
it
into
his
mouth
now
the
old
gentleman
had
placed
a
few
artificial
cherries
at
the
top
of
the
others
filled
with
cayenne
pepper
one
of
these
henry
had
unfortunately
taken
and
it
made
his
month
smart
and
burn
most
intolerably
the
old
gentleman
heard
him
coughing
and
knew
very
well
what
was
the
matter
the
boy
that
would
take
what
did
not
belong
to
him
if
no
more
than
a
cherry
was
not
the
boy
for
him
henry
wilkins
was
sent
about
his
business
without
delay
with
his
mouth
almost
as
hot
as
if
he
had
put
a
burning
coal
in
to
it
rufus
wilson
was
next
introduced
into
the
room
and
left
to
himself
but
he
had
not
been
there
ten
minutes
before
he
began
to
move
from
one
place
to
another
he
was
of
a
bold
resolute
temper
but
not
overburdened
with
principle
for
if
he
could
have
opened
every
cupboard
closet
and
drawer
in
the
house
without
being
found
out
he
would
have
done
it
directly
having
looked
around
the
room
he
noticed
a
drawer
to
the
table
and
made
up
his
mind
to
peep
therein
but
no
sooner
did
he
lay
hold
of
the
drawer
knob
than
he
set
a
large
bell
ringing
which
was
concealed
under
the
table
the
old
gentleman
immediately
answered
the
summons
and
entered
the
room
rufus
was
so
startled
by
the
sudden
ringing
of
the
bell
that
all
his
impudence
could
not
support
him
he
looked
as
though
anyone
might
knock
him
down
with
a
feather
the
old
gentleman
asked
him
if
he
had
rung
the
bell
because
he
wanted
anything
rufus
was
much
confused
and
stammered
and
tried
to
excuse
himself
but
all
to
no
purpose
for
it
did
not
prevent
him
from
being
ordered
off
the
premises
george
jones
was
then
shown
into
the
room
by
an
old
steward
and
being
of
a
cautious
disposition
he
touched
nothing
but
only
looked
at
the
things
about
him
at
last
he
saw
that
a
closet
door
was
a
little
open
and
thinking
it
would
be
impossible
for
anyone
to
know
that
he
had
opened
it
a
little
more
he
very
cautiously
opened
it
an
inch
farther
looking
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
door
that
it
might
not
catch
against
anything
and
make
a
noise
now
had
he
looked
at
the
top
instead
of
the
bottom
it
might
have
been
better
for
him
for
to
the
top
of
the
door
was
fastened
a
plug
which
filled
up
the
hole
of
a
small
barrel
of
shot
he
ventured
to
open
the
door
another
inch
and
then
another
till
the
plug
being
pulled
out
of
the
barrel
the
leaden
shot
began
to
pour
out
at
a
strange
rate
at
the
bottom
of
the
closet
was
placed
a
tin
pan
and
the
shot
falling
upon
this
pan
made
such
a
clatter
that
george
was
frightened
half
out
of
his
senses
the
old
gentleman
soon
came
into
the
room
to
inquire
what
was
the
matter
and
there
he
found
george
nearly
as
pale
as
a
sheet
george
was
soon
dismissed
it
now
came
the
turn
of
albert
jenkins
to
be
put
into
the
room
the
other
boys
had
been
sent
to
their
homes
by
different
ways
and
no
one
knew
what
the
experience
of
the
other
had
been
in
the
room
of
trial
on
the
table
stood
a
small
round
box
with
a
screw
top
to
it
and
albert
thinking
it
contained
something
curious
could
not
be
easy
without
unscrewing
the
top
but
no
sooner
did
he
do
this
than
out
bounced
an
artificial
snake
full
a
yard
long
and
fell
upon
his
arm
he
started
back
and
uttered
a
scream
which
brought
the
old
gentleman
to
his
elbow
there
stood
albert
with
the
bottom
of
the
box
in
one
hand
the
top
in
the
other
and
the
snake
on
the
floor
come
come
said
the
old
gentleman
one
snake
is
quite
enough
to
have
in
the
house
at
a
time
therefore
the
sooner
you
are
gone
the
better
with
that
he
dismissed
him
without
waiting
a
moment
for
his
reply
william
smith
next
entered
the
room
and
being
left
alone
soon
began
to
amuse
himself
in
looking
at
the
curiosities
around
him
william
was
not
only
curious
and
prying
but
dishonest
too
and
observing
that
the
key
was
left
in
the
drawer
of
a
bookcase
he
stepped
on
tiptoe
in
that
direction
the
key
had
a
wire
fastened
to
it
which
communicated
with
an
electrical
machine
and
william
received
such
a
shock
as
he
was
not
likely
to
forget
no
sooner
did
he
sufficiently
recover
himself
to
walk
than
he
was
told
to
leave
the
house
and
let
other
people
lock
and
unlock
their
own
drawers
the
other
boy
was
harry
gordon
and
though
he
was
left
in
the
room
full
twenty
minutes
he
never
during
that
time
stirred
from
his
chair
harry
had
eyes
in
his
head
as
well
as
the
others
but
he
had
more
integrity
in
his
heart
neither
the
dish
cover
the
cherries
the
drawer
knob
the
closet
door
the
round
box
nor
the
key
tempted
him
to
rise
from
his
feet
and
the
consequence
was
that
in
half
an
hour
after
he
was
engaged
in
the
service
of
the
old
gentleman
at
elm
tree

he
followed
his

ix
the
maniac
a
gentleman
who
had
traveled
in
europe
relates
that
he
one
day
visited
the
hospital
of
berlin
where
he
saw
a
man
whose
exterior
was
very
striking
his
figure
tall
and
commanding
was
bending
with
age
but
more
with
sorrow
the
few
scattered
hairs
which
remained
on
his
temples
were
white
almost
as
the
driven
snow
and
the
deepest
melancholy
was
depicted
in
his
countenance
on
inquiring
who
he
was
and
what
brought
him
there
he
started
as
if
from
sleep
and
after
looking
around
him
began
with
slow
and
measured
steps
to
stride
the
hall
repeating
in
a
low
but
audible
voice
once
one
is
two
once
one
is
two
now
and
then
he
would
stop
and
remain
with
his
arms
folded
on
his
breast
as
if
in
contemplation
for
some
minutes
then
again
resuming
his
walk
he
continued
to
repeat
once
one
is
two
once
one
is
two
his
story
as
our
traveler
understood
it
is
as
follows
conrad
lange
collector
of
the
revenues
of
the
city
of
berlin
had
long
been
known
as
a
man
whom
nothing
could
divert
from
the
paths
of
honesty
scrupulously
exact
in
an
his
dealings
and
assiduous
in
the
discharge
of
all
his
duties
he
had
acquired
the
good
will
and
esteem
of
all
who
knew
him
and
the
confidence
of
the
minister
of
finance
whose
duty
it
is
to
inspect
the
accounts
of
all
officers
connected
with
the
revenue
on
casting
up
his
accounts
at
the
close
of
a
particular
year
he
found
a
deficit
of
ten
thousand
ducats
alarmed
at
this
discovery
he
went
to
the
minister
presented
his
accounts
and
informed
him
that
he
did
not
know
how
it
had
arisen
and
that
he
had
been
robbed
by
some
person
bent
on
his
ruin
the
minister
received
his
accounts
but
thinking
it
a
duty
to
secure
a
person
who
might
probably
be
a
defaulter
he
caused
him
to
be
arrested
and
put
his
accounts
into
the
hands
of
one
of
his
secretaries
for
inspection
who
returned
them
the
day
after
with
the
information
that
the
deficiency
arose
from
a
miscalculation
that
in
multiplying
lange
had
said
once
one
is
two
instead
of
once
one
is
one
the
poor
man
was
immediately
released
from
confinement
his
accounts
returned
and
the
mistake
pointed
out
during
his
imprisonment
which
lasted
two
days
he
had
neither
eaten
drunk
nor
taken
any
repose
and
when
he
appeared
his
countenance
was
as
pale
as
death
on
receiving
his
accounts
he
was
a
long
time
silent
then
suddenly
awaking
as
if
from
a
trance
he
repeated
once
one
is
two
he
appeared
to
be
entirely
insensible
of
his
situation
would
neither
eat
nor
drink
unless
solicited
and
took
notice
of
nothing
that
passed
around
him
while
repeating
his
accustomed
phrase
if
anyone
corrected
him
by
saying
once
one
is
one
his
attention
was
arrested
for
a
moment
and
he
said
ah
right
once
one
is
one
and
then
resuming
his
walk
he
continued
to
repeat
once
one
is
two
he
died
shortly
after
the
traveler
left
berlin

affecting
story

true
or
untrue

on
a

and
he
never

in

edited

our
bachelor
uncle
who
lived
with
us
was
a
quiet
genial
man
much
given
to
hunting
and
fishing
and
it
was
one
of
the
pleasures
of
our
young
life
to
accompany
him
on
his
expeditions
to
great
hill
woods
the
pond
and
best
of
all
to
the
country
brook
we
were
quite
willing
to
work
hard
in
the
cornfield
or
the
haying
lot
to
finish
the
necessary
labor
in
season
for
an
afternoon
stroll
through
the
woods
and
along
the
brookside
i
remember
my
first
fishing
excursion
as
if
it
were
but
yesterday
i
have
been
happy
many
times
in
my
life
but
never
more
intensely
so
than
when
i
received
that
first
fishing
pole
from
my
uncle
hand
and
trudged
off
with
him
through
the
woods
and
meadows
it
was
a
still
sweet
day
of
early
summer
the
long
afternoon
shadows
of
the
trees
lay
cool
across
our
path
the
leaves
seemed
greener
the
flowers
brighter
the
birds
merrier
than
ever
before
my
uncle
who
knew
by
long
experience
where
were
the
best
haunts
of
pickerel
considerately
placed
me
at
the
most
favorable
point
i
threw
out
my
line
as
i
had
so
often
seen
others
and
waited
anxiously
for
a
bite
moving
the
bait
in
rapid
jerks
on
the
surface
of
the
water
in
imitation
of
the
leap
of
a
frog
nothing
came
of
it
try
again
said
my
uncle
suddenly
the
bait
sank
out
of
sight
now
for
it
thought
i
here
is
a
fish
at
last
i
made
a
strong
pull
and
brought
up
a
tangle
of
weeds
again
and
again
i
cast
out
my
line
with
aching
arms
and
drew
it
back
empty
i
looked
at
my
uncle
appealingly
try
once
more
he
said
we
fishermen
must
have
patience
suddenly
something
tugged
at
my
line
and
swept
off
with
it
into
deep
water
jerking
it
up
i
saw
a
fine
pickerel
wriggling
in
the
sun
uncle
i
cried
looking
back
in
uncontrollable
excitement
i
got
a
fish
not
yet
said
my
uncle
as
he
spoke
there
was
a
plash
in
the
water
i
caught
the
arrowy
gleam
of
a
scared
fish
shooting
into
the
middle
of
the
stream
my
hook
hung
empty
from
the
line
i
had
lost
my
prize
we
are
apt
to
speak
of
the
sorrows
of
childhood
as
trifles
in
comparison
with
those
of
people
but
we
may
depend
upon
it
the
young
folks
do
agree
with
us
our
griefs
modified
and
restrained
by
reason
experience
and
keep
the
proprieties
and
if
possible
avoid
a
scene
but
the
sorrow
of
childhood
unreasoning
and
is
a
complete
abandonment
to
the
passion
the
doll
nose
is
broken
and
the
world
breaks
up
with
it
the
marble
rolls
out
of
sight
and
the
solid
globe
rolls
off
with
the
marble
so
overcome
with
my
great
and
bitter
disappointment
i
sat
down
on
the
nearest
hassock
and
for
a
time
refused
to
be
comforted
even
by
my
uncle
assurance
that
there
were
more
fish
in
the
brook
he
refitted
my
bait
and
putting
the
pole
again
in
my
hands
told
me
to
try
my
luck
once
more
but
remember
boy
he
said
with
his
shrewd
smile
never
brag
of
catching
a
fish
until
he
is
on
dry
ground
i
seen
older
folks
doing
that
in
more
ways
than
one
and
so
making
fools
of
themselves
it
no
use
to
boast
of
anything
until
it
done
nor
then
either
for
it
speaks
for
itself
how
often
since
i
have
been
reminded
of
the
fish
that
i
did
not
catch
when
i
hear
people
boasting
of
a
work
as
yet
undone
and
trying
to
anticipate
the
credit
which
belongs
only
to
actual
achievement
i
call
to
mind
that
scene
by
the
brookside
and
the
wise
caution
of
my
uncle
in
that
particular
instance
takes
the
form
of
a
proverb
of
universal
application
never
brag
of
your
fish

you

xiii
respect
for
the
sabbath
rewarded
in
the
city
of
bath
not
many
years
since
lived
a
barber
who
made
a
practice
of
following
his
ordinary
occupation
on
the
lord
day
as
he
was
on
the
way
to
his
morning
employment
he
happened
to
look
into
some
place
of
worship
just
as
the
minister
was
giving
out
his
text
remember
the
sabbath
day
to
keep
it
holy
he
listened
long
enough
to
be
convinced
that
he
was
constantly
breaking
the
laws
of
god
and
man
by
shaving
and
dressing
his
customers
on
the
lord
day
he
became
uneasy
and
went
with
a
heavy
heart
to
his
sabbath
task
at
length
he
took
courage
and
opened
his
mind
to
his
minister
who
advised
him
to
give
up
sabbath
work
and
worship
god
he
replied
that
beggary
would
be
the
consequence
he
had
a
flourishing
trade
but
it
would
almost
all
be
lost
at
length
after
many
a
sleepless
night
spent
in
weeping
and
praying
he
was
determined
to
cast
all
his
care
upon
god
as
the
more
he
reflected
the
more
his
duty
became
apparent
he
discontinued
his
sabbath
work
went
constantly
and
early
to
the
public
services
of
religion
and
soon
enjoyed
that
satisfaction
of
mind
which
is
one
of
the
rewards
of
doing
our
duty
and
that
peace
which
the
world
can
neither
give
nor
take
away
the
consequences
he
foresaw
actually
followed
his
genteel
customers
left
him
and
he
was
nicknamed
puritan
or
methodist
he
was
obliged
to
give
up
his
fashionable
shop
and
in
the
course
of
years
became
so
reduced
as
to
take
a
cellar
under
the
old
market
house
and
shave
the
poorer
people
one
saturday
evening
between
light
and
dark
a
stranger
from
one
of
the
coaches
asking
for
a
barber
was
directed
by
the
hostler
to
the
cellar
opposite
coming
in
hastily
he
requested
to
be
shaved
quickly
while
they
changed
horses
as
he
did
not
like
to
violate
the
sabbath
this
was
touching
the
barber
on
a
tender
chord
he
burst
into
tears
asked
the
stranger
to
lend
him
a
to
buy
a
candle
as
it
was
not
light
enough
to
shave
him
with
safety
he
did
so
revolving
in
his
mind
the
extreme
poverty
to
which
the
poor
man
must
be
reduced
when
shaved
he
said
there
must
be
something
extraordinary
in
your
history
which
i
have
not
now
time
to
hear
here
is
half
a
crown

you

the

supposed

dead
and
has
left
an
immense
fortune
which
i
will
put
you
in
possession
of
when
all
legal
doubts
are
removed
they
went
by
the
coach
saw
the
pretended
william
reed
and
proved
him
to
be
an
impostor
the
stranger
who
was
a
pious
attorney
was
soon
legally
satisfied
of
the
barber
identity
and
told
him
that
he
had
advertised
him
in
vain
providence
had
now
thrown
him
in
his
way
in
a
most
extraordinary
manner
and
he
had
great
pleasure
in
transferring
a
great
many
thousand
pounds
to
a
worthy
man

rightful
heir
of
the
property
thus

an
unexpected
sight
of
either
of

will
make
even
the
lords
of
creation
recoil
but
there
is
a
species
of
worm
found
in
various
parts
of
this
country
which
conveys
a
poison
of
a
nature
so
deadly
that
compared

even
the

of
the
rattlesnake
is
harmless
to
guard
our

this
foe

kind
is
the
object
of

this
worm
varies

size
it
is
frequently
an
inch
in
diameter
but
as
it
is
rarely
seen
except
when
coiled
its
length
can
hardly
be
conjectured
it
is
of
a
dull
lead
color
and
generally
lives
near
a
spring
or
small
stream
of
water
and
bites
the
unfortunate
people
who
are
in
the
habit
of
going
there
to
drink
the
brute
creation
it
never
molests
they
avoid
it
with
the
same
instinct
that
teaches
the
animals
of

to
shun
the
deadly
cobra
several
of
these
reptiles
have
long
infested
our

to
the
misery

destruction
of

i
have
therefore
had
frequent
opportunities
of
being
the
melancholy
spectator
of
the
effects
produced
by
the
subtile
poison
which
this
worm
infuses
the
symptoms
of
its
bite
are
terrible
the
eyes
of
the
patient
become
red
and
fiery
his
tongue
swells

poetical
works

joan
of
arc
thalaba
the
destroyer
madoc
roderick
and
the
curse
of

it
was
a
summer
evening
old
kaspar
work
was
done
and
he
before
his
cottage
door
was
sitting
in
the
sun
and
by
him
sported
on
the
green
his
little
grandchild
wilhelmine
she
saw
her
brother
peterkin
roll
something
large
and
round
which
he
beside
the
rivulet
in
playing
there
had
found
he
came
to
ask
what
he
had
found
that
was
so
large
and
smooth
and
round
old
kaspar
took
it
from
the
boy
who
stood
expectant
by
and
then
the
old
man
shook
his
head
and
with
a
natural
sigh
is
some
poor
fellow
skull
said
he
who
fell
in
the
great
victory
i
find
them
in
the
garden
for
there
many
hereabout
and
often
when
i

turns
them
out
for

great

about
young

wilhelmine
looks
up
with
eyes
now
tell
us
all
about
the
war
and
what
they
killed
each
other
for
it
was
the
english
kaspar
cried
who
put
the
french
to
rout
but
what
they
killed
each
other
for
i
could
not
well
make
out
but
everybody
said
quoth
he
that
was
a
famous
victory
my
father
lived
at
blenheim
then
yon
little
stream
hard
by
they
burnt
his
dwelling
to
the
ground
and
he
was
forced
to
fly
so
with
his
wife
and
child
he
fled
nor
had
he
where
to
rest
his
head
with
fire
and
sword
the
country
round
was
wasted
far
and
wide
and
many
a
nursing
mother
then
and
newborn
baby
died
but
things
like
that
you
know
must
be
at
every
famous
victory
they
say
it
was
a
shocking
sight
after
the
field
was
won
for
many
thousand
bodies
here
lay
rotting
in
the
sun
but
things
like
that
you
know
must
be
after
a
famous
victory
great
praise
the
duke
of
marlboro
won
and
our
young
prince
eugene
why
was
a
very
wicked
thing
said
little
wilhelmine
nay
nay
my
little
girl
quoth
he
it
was
a
famous
victory
and
everybody
praised
the
duke
who
this
great
fight
did
win
but
what
good
came
of
it
at
last
quoth
little
peterkin
why
that
i
can
not
tell
said
he
but
was
a
glorious
victory
the
battle
of
blenheim
in
the

of
the

xxi
i
pity
them
a
poor
man
once
undertook
to
emigrate
from
castine
to
illinois
when
he
was
attempting
to
cross
a
river
in
new
york
his
horse
broke
through
the
rotten
timbers
of
the
bridge
and
was
drowned
he
had
but
this
one
animal
to
convey
all
his
property
and
his
family
to
his
new
home
his
wife
and
children
were
almost
miraculously
saved
from
sharing
the
fate
of
the
horse
but
the
loss
of
this
poor
animal
was
enough
by
its
aid
the
family
it
may
be
said
had
lived
and
moved
now
they
were
left
helpless
in
a
land
of
strangers
without
the
ability
to
go
on
or
return
without
money
or
a
single
friend
to
whom
to
appeal
the
case
was
a
hard
one
there
were
a
great
many
who
passed
by
on
the
other
side
some
even
laughed
at
the
predicament
in
which
the
man
was
placed
but
by
degrees
a
group
of
people
began
to
collect
all
of
whom
pitied
him
some
pitied
him
a
great
deal
and
some
did
not
pity
him
very
much
because
they
said
he
might
have
known
better
than
to
try
to
cross
an
unsafe
bridge
and
should
have
made
his
horse
swim
the
river
pity
however
seemed
rather
to
predominate
some
pitied
the
man
and
some
the
horse
all
pitied
the
poor
sick
mother
and
her
six
helpless
children
among
this
pitying
party
was
a
rough
son
of
the
west
who
knew
what
it
was
to
migrate
some
hundreds
of
miles
over
new
roads
to
locate
a
destitute
family
on
a
prairie
seeing
the
man
forlorn
situation
and
looking
around
on
the
bystanders
he
said
all
of
you
seem
to
pity
these
poor
people
very
much
but
i
would
beg
leave
to
ask
each
of
you
how
much
there
stranger
continued
he
holding
up
a
ten
dollar
bill
there
is
the
amount
of
my
pity
and
if
others
will
do
as
i
do
you
may
soon
get
another
pony
god
bless
you
it
is
needless
to
state
the
effect
that
this
active
charity
produced
in
a
short
time
the
happy
emigrant
arrived
at
his
destination
and
he
is
now
a
thriving
farmer
and
a
neighbor
to
him
who
was
his
friend
in
need
and
a
friend
indeed
to
remove
from
one
country
or
state
to
another
for
the
purpose
of
residence

migrate
as

king
charles

and
william
penn
king
charles
well
friend
william
i
have
sold
you
a
noble
province
in
north
america
but
still
i
suppose
you
have
no
thoughts
of
going
thither
yourself
penn
yes
i
have
i
assure
thee
friend
charles
and
i
am
just
come
to
bid
thee
farewell
what
venture
yourself
among
the
savages
of
north
america
why
man
what
security
have
you
that
you
will
not
be
in
their
war
kettle
in
two
hours
after
setting
foot
on
their
shores
the
best
security
in
the
world
i
doubt
that
friend
william
i
have
no
idea
of
any
security
against
those
cannibals
but
in
a
regiment
of
good
soldiers
with
their
muskets
and
bayonets
and
mind
i
tell
you
beforehand
that
with
all
my
good
will
for
you
and
your
family
to
whom
i
am
under
obligations
i
will
not
send
a
single
soldier
with
you
i
want
none
of
thy
soldiers
charles
i
depend
on
something
better
than
thy
soldiers
ah
what
may
that
be
why
i
depend
upon
themselves
on
the
working
of
their
own
hearts
on
their
notions
of
justice
on
their
moral
sense
a
fine
thing
this
same
moral
sense
no
doubt
but
i
fear
you
will
not
find
much
of
it
among
the
indians
of
north
america
and
why
not
among
them
as
well
as
others
because
if
they
had
possessed
any
they
would
not
have
treated
my
subjects
so
barbarously
as
they
have
done
that
is
no
proof
of
the
contrary
friend
charles
thy
subjects
were
the
aggressors
when
thy
subjects
first
went
to
north
america
they
found
these
poor
people
the
fondest
and
kindest
creatures
in
the
world
every
day
they
would
watch
for
them
to
come
ashore
and
hasten
to
meet
them
and
feast
them
on
the
best
fish
and
venison
and
corn
which
were
all
they
had
in
return
for
this
hospitality
of
the
savages
as
we
call
them
thy
subjects
termed
christians
seized
on
their
country
and
rich
hunting
grounds
for
farms
for
themselves
now
is
it
to
be
wondered
at
that
these
people
should
have
been
driven
to
desperation
by
such
injustice
and
that
burning
with
revenge
they
should
have
committed
some
excesses
k
well
then
i
hope
you
will
not
complain
when
they
come
to
treat
you
in
the
same
manner
i
am
not
afraid
of
it
ah
how
will
you
avoid
it
you
mean
to
get
their
hunting
grounds
too
i
suppose
yes
but
not
by
driving
these
poor
people
away
from
them
no
indeed
how
then
will
you
get
their
lands
i
mean
to
buy
their
lands
of
them
buy

why
man
you
have
already
bought
them
of
me
yes
i
know
i
have
and
at
a
dear
rate
too
but
i
did
it
only
to
get
thy
good
will
not
that
i
thought
thou
hadst
any
right
to
their
lands
how
man
no
right
to
their

no
friend
charles
no
right
no
right
at
all
what
right
hast
thou
to
their
lands
why
the
right
of
discovery
to
be
sure
the
right
which
the
pope
and
all
christian
kings
have
agreed
to
give
one
another
the
right
of
discovery
a
strange
kind
of
right
indeed
now
suppose
friend
charles
that
some
canoe
load
of
these
indians
crossing
the
sea
and
discovering
this
island
of
great
britain
were
to
claim
it
as
their
own
and
set
it
up
for
sale
over
thy
head
what
wouldst
thou
think
of
it
why
why
why
i
must
confess
i
should
think
it
a
piece
of
great
impudence
in
them
well
then
how
canst
thou
a
christian
and
a
christian
prince
too
do
that
which
thou
so
utterly
condemnest
in
these
people
whom
thou
callest
savages
and
suppose
again
that
these
indians
on
thy
refusal
to
give
up
thy
island
of
great
britain
were
to
make
war
on
thee
and
having
weapons
more
destructive
than
thine
were
to
destroy
many
of
thy
subjects
and
drive
the
rest
away
wouldst
thou
not
think
it
horribly
cruel
i
must
say
friend
william
that
i
should
how
can
i
say
otherwise
well
then
how
can
i
who
call
myself
a
christian
do
what
i
should
abhor
even
in
the
heathen
no
i
will
not
do
it
but
i
will
buy
the
right
of
the
proper
owners
even
of
the
indians
themselves
by
doing
this
i
shall
imitate
god
himself
in
his
justice
and
mercy

thereby
insure
his

the
righteous
never
forsaken
it
was
saturday
night
and
the
widow
of
the
pine
cottage
sat
by
her
blazing
fagots
with
her
five
tattered
children
at
her
side
endeavoring
by
listening
to
the
artlessness
of
their
prattle
to
dissipate
the
heavy
gloom
that
pressed
upon
her
mind
for
a
year
her
own
feeble
hand
had
provided
for
her
helpless
family
for
she
had
no
supporter
she
thought
of
no
friend
in
all
the
wide
unfriendly
world
around
but
that
mysterious
providence
the
wisdom
of
whose
ways
is
above
human
comprehension
had
visited
her
with
wasting
sickness
and
her
little
means
had
become
exhausted
it
was
now
too
midwinter
and
the
snow
lay
heavy
and
deep
through
all
the
surrounding
forests
while
storms
still
seemed
gathering
in
the
heavens
and
the
driving
wind
roared
amid
the
neighboring
pines
and
rocked
her
puny
mansion
the
last
herring
smoked
upon
the
coals
before
her
it
was
the
only
article
of
food
she
possessed
and
no
wonder
her
forlorn
desolate
state
brought
up
in
her
lone
bosom
all
the
anxieties
of
a
mother
when
she
looked
upon
her
children
and
no
wonder
forlorn
as
she
was
if
she
suffered
the
heart
swellings
of
despair
to
rise
even
though
she
knew
that
he
whose
promise
is
to
the
widow
and
to
the
orphan
can
not
forget
his
word
providence
had
many
years
before
taken
from
her
her
eldest
son
who
went
from
his
forest
home
to
try
his
fortune
on
the
high
seas
since
which
she
had
heard
no
tidings
of
him
and
in
her
latter
time
had
by
the
hand
of
death
deprived
her
of
the
companion
and
staff
of
her
earthly
pilgrimage
in
the
person
of
her
husband
yet
to
this
hour
she
had
upborne
she
had
not
only
been
able
to
provide
for
her
little
flock
but
had
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
ministering
to
the
wants
of
the
miserable
and
destitute
the
indolent
may
well
bear
with
poverty
while
the
ability
to
gain
sustenance
remains
the
individual
who
has
but
his
own
wants
to
supply
may
suffer
with
fortitude
the
winter
of
want
his
affections
are
not
wounded
his
heart
is
not
wrung
the
most
desolate
in
populous
cities
may
hope
for
charity
has
not
quite
closed
her
hand
and
heart
and
shut
her
eyes
on
misery
but
the
industrious
mother
of
helpless
and
depending
children
far
from
the
reach
of
human
charity
has
none
of
these
to
console
her
and
such
a
one
was
the
widow
of
the
pine
cottage
but
as
she
bent
over
the
fire
and
took
up
the
last
scanty
remnant
of
food
to
spread
before
her
children
her
spirits
seemed
to
brighten
up
as
by
some
sudden
and
mysterious
impulse
and
cowper
beautiful
lines
came
uncalled
across
her
mind
judge
not
the
lord
by
feeble
sense
but
trust
him
for
his
grace
behind
a
frowning
providence
he
hides
a
smiling
face
the
smoked
herring
was
scarcely
laid
upon
the
table
when
a
gentle
rap
at
the
door
and
the
loud
barking
of
a
dog
attracted
the
attention
of
the
family
the
children
flew
to
open
it
and
a
weary
traveler
in
tattered
garments
and
in
apparently
indifferent
health
entered
and
begged
a
lodging
and
a
mouthful
of
food
said
he
it
is
now
since
i
tasted
bread
the
widow
heart
bled
anew
as
under
a
fresh
complication
of
distresses
for
her
sympathies
lingered
not
around
her
fireside
she
hesitated
not
even
now
rest
and
a
share
of
all
she
had
she
proffered
to
the
stranger
shall
not
be
forsaken
said
she
or
suffer
deeper
for
an
act
of
charity
the
traveler
drew
near
the
board
but
when
he
saw
the
scanty
fare
he
raised
his
eyes
toward
heaven
with
astonishment
and
is
this
all
your
store
said
he
and
a
share
of
this
do
you
offer
to
one
you
know
not
then
never
saw
i
charity
before
but
madam
said
he
continuing
do
you
not
wrong
your
children
by
giving
a
part
of
your
last
mouthful

gushed

a
tale
of
scottish
life
lucy
was
only
six
years
old
but
bold
as
a
fairy
she
had
gone
by
herself
a
thousand
times
about
the
braes
and
often
upon
errands
to
houses
two
or
three
miles
distant
what
had
her
parents
to
fear
the
footpaths
were
all
firm
and
led
to
no
places
of
danger
nor
are
infants
themselves
incautious
when
alone
in
then
pastimes
lucy
went
singing
into
the
low
woods
and
singing
she
reappeared
on
the
open
hillside
with
her
small
white
hand
on
the
rail
she
glided
along
the
wooden
bridge
or
tripped
from
stone
to
stone
across
the
shallow
streamlet
the
creature
would
be
away
for
hours
and
no
fear
be
felt
on
her
account
by
anyone
at
home
whether
she
had
gone
with
her
basket
on
her
arm
to
borrow
some
articles
of
household
use
from
a
neighbor
or
merely
for
her
own
solitary
delight
had
wandered
off
to
the
braes
to
play
among
the
flowers
coming
back
laden
with
wreaths
and
garlands
the
happy
child
had
been
invited
to
pass
a
whole
day
from
morning
to
night
at
ladyside
a
farmhouse
about
two
miles
off
with
her
playmates
the
maynes
and
she
left
home
about
an
hour
after
sunrise
during
her
absence
the
house
was
silent
but
happy
and
the
evening
being
now
far
advanced
lucy
was
expected
home
every
minute
and
michael
agnes
and
isabel
her
father
mother
and
aunt
went
to
meet
her
on
the
way
they
walked
on
and
on
wondering
a
little
but
in
no
degree
alarmed
till
they
reached
ladyside
and
heard
the
cheerful
din
of
the
children
within
still
rioting
at
the
close
of
the
holiday
jacob
mayne
came
to
the
door
but
on
their
kindly
asking
why
lucy
had
not
been
sent
home
before
daylight
was
over
he
looked
painfully
surprised
and
said
that
she
had
not
been
at
ladyside
within
two
hours
a
hundred
persons
were
traversing
the
hills
in
all
directions
even
at
a
distance
which
it
seemed
most
unlikely
that
poor
lucy
could
have
reached
the
shepherds
and
their
dogs
all
the
night
through
searched
every
nook
every
stony
and
rocky
place
every
piece
of
taller
heather
every
crevice
that
could
conceal
anything
alive
or
dead
but
no
lucy
was
there
her
mother
who
for
a
while
seemed
inspired
with
supernatural
strength
had
joined
in
the
search
and
with
a
quaking
heart
looked
into
every
brake
or
stopped
and
listened
to
every
shout
and
halloo
reverberating
among
the
hills
intent
to
seize
upon
some
tone
of
recognition
or
discovery
but
the
moon
sank
and
then
the
stars
whose
increased
brightness
had
for
a
short
time
supplied
her
place
all
faded
away
and
then
came
the
gray
dawn
of
the
morning
and
then
the
clear
brightness
of
the
day
and
still
michael
and
agnes
were
childless
she
has
sunk
into
some
mossy
or
miry
place
said
michael
to
a
man
near
him
into
whose
face
he
could
not
look
a
cruel
cruel
death
to
one
like
her
the
earth
on
which
my
child
walked
has
closed
over
her
and
we
shall
never
see
her
more
at
last
a
man
who
had
left
the
search
and
gone
in
a
direction
toward
the
highroad
came
running
with
something
in
his
arms
toward
the
place
where
michael
and
others
were
standing
beside
agnes
who
lay
apparently
exhausted
almost
to
dying
on
the
sward
he
approached
hesitatingly
and
michael
saw
that
he
carried
lucy
bonnet
clothes
and
plaid
it
was
impossible
not
to
see
some
spots
of
blood
upon
the
frill
that
the
child
had
worn
around
her
neck
murdered
murdered
was
the
one
word
whispered
or
ejaculated
all
around
but
agnes
heard
it
not
for
worn
out
by
that
long
night
of
hope
and
despair
she
had
fallen
asleep
and
was
perhaps
seeking
her
lost
lucy
in
her
dreams
isabel
took
the
clothes
and
narrowly
inspecting
them
with
eye
and
hand
said
with
a
fervent
voice
that
was
heard
even
in
michael
despair
no
lucy
is
yet
among
the
living
there
are
no
marks
of
violence
on
the
garments
of
the
innocent
no
murderer
hand
has
been
here
these
blood
spots
have

here
to
deceive
besides
would
not
the
murderer
have
carried
off
these
things
for
what
else
would
he
have
murdered
her
but
oh
foolish
despair
what
speak
i
of
for
wicked
as
the
world
is
ay
desperately
wicked
there
is
not
on
all
the
surface
of
the
wide
earth
a
hand
that
would
murder
our
child
is
it
not
plain
as
the
sun
in
the
heaven
that
lucy
has
been
stolen
by
some
wretched
gypsy
beggar
the
crowd
quietly
dispersed
and
horse
and
foot
began
to
scour
the
country
some
took
the
highroads
others
all
the
bypaths
and
many
the
trackless
hills
now
that
they
were
in
some
measure
relieved
from
the
horrible
belief
that
the
child
was
dead
the
worst
other
calamity
seemed
nothing
for
hope
brought
her
back
to
their
arms
agnes
had
been
able
to
walk
home
to
and
michael
and
isabel
sat
by
her
bedside
all
her
strength
was
gone
and
she
lay
at
the
mercy
of
the
rustle
of
a
leaf
or
a
shadow
across
the
window
thus
hour
after
hour
passed
till
it
was
again
twilight
i
hear
footsteps
coming
up
the
brae
said
agnes
who
had
for
some
time
appeared
to
be
slumbering
and
in
a
few
moments
the
voice
of
jacob
mayne
was
heard
at
the
outer
door
jacob
wore
a
solemn
expression
of
countenance
and
he
seemed
from
his
looks
to
bring
no
comfort
michael
stood
up
between
him
and
his
wife
and
looked
into
his
heart
something
there
seemed
to
be
in
his
face
that
was
not
miserable
if
he
has
heard
nothing
of
my
child
thought
michael
this
man
must
care
little
for
his
own
fireside
oh
speak
speak
said
agnes
yet
why
need
you
speak
all
this
has
been
but
a
vain
belief
and
lucy
is
in
heaven
something
like
a
trace
of
her
has
been
discovered
a
woman
with
a
child
that
did
not
look
like
a
child
of
hers
was
last
night
at
clovenford
and
left
it
at
the
dawning
do
you
hear
that
my
beloved
agnes
said
isabel
she
will
have
tramped
away
with
lucy
up
into
ettrick
or
yarrow
but
hundreds
of
eyes
will
have
been
upon
her
for
these
are
quiet
but
not
solitary
glens
and
the
hunt
will
be
over
long
before
she
has
crossed
down
upon
hawick
i
knew
that
country
in
my
young
days
what
say
you
mayne
there
is
the
light
of
hope
in
your
face
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
that
it
was
lucy
everybody
is
sure
of
it
if
it
was
my
own
rachel
i
should
have
no
fear
as
to
seeing
her
this
blessed
night
jacob
mayne
now
took
a
chair
and
sat
down
with
even
a
smile
upon
his
countenance
i
may
tell
you
now
that
watty
oliver
knows
it
was
your
child
for
he
saw
her
limping
along
after
the
gypsy
at
but
having
no
suspicion
he
did
not
take
a
second
look
at
her
but
one
look
is
sufficient
and
he
swears
it
was
bonny
lucy
forester
aunt
isabel
by
this
time
had
bread
and
cheese
and
a
bottle
of
her
own
wine
on
the
table
you
have
been
a
long
and
hard
journey
wherever
you
have
been
mayne
take
some
refreshment
and
michael
asked
a
blessing
jacob
saw
that
he
might
now
venture
to
reveal
the
whole
truth
no
no
irving
i
am
over
happy
to
eat
or
to
drink
you
are
all
prepared
for
the
blessing
that
awaits
you
your
child
is
not
far
off
and
i
myself
for
it
is
i
myself
that
found
her
will
bring
her
by
the
hand
and
restore
her
to
her
parents
agnes
had
raised
herself
up
in
her
bed
at
these
words
but
she
sank
gently
back
on
her
pillow
aunt
isabel
was
rooted
to
her
chair
and
michael
as
he
rose
up
felt
as
if
the
ground
were
sinking
under
his
feet
there
was
a
dead
silence
all
around
the
house
for
a
short
space
and
then
the
sound
of
many
voices
which
again
by
degrees
subsided
the
eyes
of
all
then
looked
and
yet
feared
to
look
toward
the
door
jacob
mayne
was
not
so
good
as
his
word
for
he
did
not
bring
lucy
by
the
hand
to
restore
her
to
her
parents
but
dressed
again
in
her
own
bonnet
and
gown
and
her
own
plaid
in
rushed
their
own
child
by
herself
with
tears
and
sobs
of
joy

to

dust
out

your
throat
if
it
be
as
thick
there
as
it
is
on
your

see
that

have
trudged
half
a
score
of
miles

like

wise
man

passed
by

make
room
for
that
other
fellow
who
seeks
my
aid
to
quench
the
fiery
fever
of
last

potations
which

drained
from
no

welcome
most
rubicund
sir
you
and
i
have
been
strangers
hitherto
nor
to
confess
the
truth
will
my
nose
be
anxious
for
a
closer
intimacy
till
the
fumes
of
your
breath
be
a
little
less
potent
mercy
on
you
man
the
water
absolutely
hisses
down
your
gullet
and
is
converted
quite
into
steam
in
the
miniature
tophet
which
you
mistake
for
a
stomach
fill
again
and
tell
me
on
the
word
of
an
honest
toper
did
you
ever
in
cellar
tavern
or
any
other
kind
of
dramshop
spend
the
price
of
your
children
food
for
a
swig
half
so
delicious
now
for
the
first
time
these
ten
years
you
know
the
flavor
of
cold
water
and
whenever
you
are
thirsty
recollect
that
i
keep
a
constant
supply
at
the
old
stand
who
next
oh
my
little
friend
you
are
just
let
loose
from
school
and
come
hither
to
scrub
your
blooming
face
and
drown
the
memory
of
certain
taps
of
the
ferule
and
other
schoolboy
troubles
in
a
draught
from
the
town
pump
take
it
pure
as
the
current
of
your
young
life
take
it
and
may
your
heart
and
tongue
never
be
scorched
with
a
fiercer
thirst
than
now
there
my
dear
child
put
down
the
cup
and
yield
your
place
to
this
elderly
gentleman
who
treads
so
tenderly
over
the
paving
stones
that
i
suspect
he
is
afraid
of
breaking
them
what
he
limps
by
without
so
much
as
thanking
me
as
if
my
hospitable
offers
were
meant
only
for
people
who
have
no
wine
cellars
well
well
sir
no
harm
done
i
hope
go
draw
the
cork
tip
the
decanter
but
when
your
great
toe
shall
set
you
it
will
be
no
affair
of
mine
if
gentlemen
love
the
pleasant
titillation
of
the
gout
it
is
all
one
to
the
town
pump
this
thirsty
dog
with
his
red
tongue
lolling
out
does
not
scorn
my
hospitality
but
stands
on
his
hind
legs
and
laps
eagerly
out
of
the
trough
see
how
lightly
he
capers
away
again
jowler
did
your
worship
ever
have
the
gout
your
pardon
good
people
i
must
interrupt
my
stream
of
eloquence
and
spout
forth
a
stream
of
water
to
replenish
the
trough
for
this
teamster
and
his
two
yoke
of
oxen
who
have
come
all
the
way
from
staunton
or
somewhere
along
that
way
no
part
of
my
business
gives
me
more
pleasure
than
the
watering
of
cattle
look
how
rapidly
they
lower
the
watermark
on
the
sides
of
the
trough
till
their
capacious
stomachs
are
moistened
with
a
gallon
or
two
apiece
and
they
can
afford
time
to
breathe
with
sighs
of
calm
enjoyment
now
they
roll
their
quiet
eyes
around
the
brim
of
their
monstrous
drinking
vessel
an
ox
is
your
true
toper
i
hold
myself
the
grand
reformer
of
the
age
from
my
spout
and
such
spouts
as
mine
must
flow
the
stream
that
shall
cleanse
our
earth
of
a
vast
portion
of
its
crime
and
anguish
which
have
gushed
from
the
fiery
fountains
of
the
still
in
this
mighty
enterprise
the
cow
shall
be
my
great
confederate
milk
and
water
ahem
dry
work
this
speechifying
especially
to
all
unpracticed
orators
i
never
conceived
till
now
what
toil
the
temperance
lecturers
undergo
for
my
sake
do
some
kind
christian
pump
a
stroke
or
two
just
to
wet
my
whistle
thank
you
sir
but
to
proceed
the
town
pump
and
the
cow
such
is
the
glorious
partnership
that
shall
finally
monopolize
the
whole
business
of
quenching
thirst
blessed
consummation
then
poverty
shall
pass
away
from
the
land
finding
no
hovel
so
wretched
where
her
squalid
form
may
shelter
itself
then
disease
for
lack
of
other
victims
shall
gnaw
his
own
heart
and
die
then
sin
if
she
do
not
die
shall
lose
half
her
strength
then
there
will
be
no
war
of
households
the
husband
and
the
wife
drinking
deep
of
peaceful
joy
a
calm
bliss
of
temperate
affections
shall
pass
hand
in
hand
through
life
and
lie
down
not
reluctantly
at
its
protracted
close
to
them
the
past
will
be
no
turmoil
of
mad
dreams
nor
the
future
an
eternity
of
such
moments
as
follow
the
delirium
of
a
drunkard
their
dead
faces
shall
express
what
their
spirits
were
and
are
to
be
by
a
lingering
smile
of
memory
and
hope
drink
then
and
be
refreshed
the
water
is
as
pure
and
cold
as
when
it
slaked
the
thirst
of
the
red
hunter
and
flowed
beneath
the
aged
bough
though
now
this
gem
of
the
wilderness
is
treasured
under
these
hot
stones
where
no
shadow
falls
but
from

not

he
was
and
stared
at
her
all
dinner
time
in
a
most
trying
manner
shaw
a
gentleman
said
how
do
you
do
my

hope
you

yourself
and
then
appeared

forget
her
entirely
shaw
a
pale
nervous
woman
greeted
her
little
guest
kindly
and
took
care
that
she
wanted
for
nothing
madam
shaw
a
quiet
old
lady
with
an
imposing
cap
exclaimed
on
seeing
polly
bless
my
heart
the
image
of
her
mother
a
sweet
woman
how
is
she
dear
and
kept
peering
at
the
newcomer
over
her
glasses
till
between
madam
and
tom
poor
polly
lost
her
appetite
her
cousin
fanny
chatted
like
a
magpie
and
little
maud
fidgeted
till
tom
proposed
to
put
her
under
the
big
dish
cover
which
produced
such
an
explosion
that
the
young
lady
was
borne
screaming
away
by
the
nurse
it
was
altogether
an
uncomfortable
dinner
and
polly
was
very
glad
when
it
was
over
they
all
went
about
their
own
affairs
and
after
doing
the
honors
of
the
house
fan
was
called
to
the
dressmaker
leaving
polly
to
amuse
herself
in
the
great
polly
was
glad
to
be
alone
for
a
few
minutes
and
having
examined
all
the
pretty
things
about
her
began
to
walk
up
and
down
over
the
soft
flowery
carpet
humming
to
herself
as
the
daylight
faded
and
only
the
ruddy
glow
of
the
fire
filled
the
room
presently
madam
came
slowly
in
and
sat
down
in
her
armchair
saying
that
a
fine
old
tune
sing
it
to
me
my
dear
i
have
heard
it
this
many
a
day
polly
did
like
to
sing
before
strangers
for
she
had
no
teaching
but
such
as
her
busy
mother
could
give
her
but
she
had
been
taught
the
utmost
respect
for
old
people
and
having
no
reason
for
refusing
she
directly
went
to
the
piano
and
did
as
she
was
bid
that
the
sort
of
music
it
a
pleasure
to
hear
sing
some
more
dear
said
madam
in
her
gentle
way
when
she
had
done
pleased
with
this
praise
polly
sang
away
in
a
fresh
little
voice
that
went
straight
to
the
listener
heart
and
nestled
there
the
sweet
old
tunes
that
one
is
never
tired
of
were
all
polly
store
the
more
she
sung
the
better
she
did
it
and
when
she
wound
up
with
a
health
to
king
charlie
the
room
quite
rung
with
the
stirring
music
made
by
the
big
piano
and
the
little
maid
that
a
jolly
tune
sing
it
again
please
cried
tom
voice
and
there
was
tom
red
head
bobbing
up
over
the
high
back
of
the
chair
where
he
had
hidden
himself
it
gave
polly
quite
a
turn
for
she
thought
no
one
was
hearing
her
but
the
old
lady
dozing
by
the
fire
i
ca
sing
any
more
i
tired
she
said
and
walked
away
to
madam
in
the
other
room
the
red
head
vanished
like
a
meteor
for
polly
tone
had
been
decidedly
cool
the
old
lady
put
out
her
hand
and
drawing
polly
to
her
knee
looked
into
her
face
with
such
kind
eyes
that
polly
forgot
the
impressive
cap
and
smiled
at
her
confidently
for
she
saw
that
her
simple
music
had
pleased
her
listener
and
she
felt
glad
to
know
it
you
mind
my
staring
dear
said
madam
softly
pinching
her
rosy
cheek
i
have
seen
a
little
girl
for
so
long
it
does
my
old
eyes
good
to
look
at
you
polly
thought
that
a
very
odd
speech
and
could
help
saying
are
fan
and
maud
little
girls
too
oh
dear
no
not
what
i
call
little
girls
fan
has
been
a
young
lady
this
two
years
and
maud
is
a
spoiled
baby
your
mother
a
very
sensible
woman
my
child
what
a
queer
old
lady
thought
polly
but
she
said
yes
respectfully
and
looked
at
the
fire
you
do
understand
what
i
mean
do
you
asked
madam
still
holding
her
by
the
chin
no
not
quite
well
dear
i
tell
you
in
my
day
children
of
fourteen
and
fifteen
did
dress
in
the
height
of
the
fashion
go
to
parties
as
nearly
like
those
of
grown
people
as
it
possible
to
make
them
lead
idle
giddy
unhealthy
lives
and
get
blase
at
twenty
we
were
little
folks
till
eighteen
or
so
worked
and
studied
dressed
and
played
like
children
honored
our
parents
and
our
days
were
much
longer
in
the
land
than
now
it
seems
to
me
the
old
lady
appeared
to
forget
polly
at
the
end
of
her
speech
for
she
sat
patting
the
plump
little
hand
that
lay
in
her
own
and
looking
up
at
a
faded
picture
of
an
old
gentleman
with
a
ruffled
shirt
and
a
queue
was
he
your
father
madam
yes
my
dear
my
honored
father
i
did
up
his
frills
to
the
day
of
his
death
and
the
first
money
i
ever
earned
was
five
dollars
which
he
offered
as
a
prize
to
whichever
of
his
six
girls
would
lay
the
handsomest
darn
in
his
silk
stockings
how
proud
you
must
have
been
cried
polly
leaning
on
the
old
knee
with
an
interested
face
yes
and
we
all
learned
to
make
bread
and
cook
and
wore
little
chintz
gowns
and
were
as
gay
and
hearty
as
kittens
all
lived
to
be
grandmothers
and
i
the
last
seventy

my
dear

more
about
your

polly
say
we
never
called
him
papa
and
if
one
of
my
brothers
had
addressed
him
as
as
boys
now
do
i
really
think
he
have
him
cut
off
with
a
shilling

the
power
of
exciting
attention
and

such

beautiful
hands
they
neither

and
you
i

scarcely

at
all
i
looked
on

are
those

more
beautiful
to
me
such

were
weary

sad
those
patient
hands
kept
toiling
on
that
the

the
discontented
pendulum
jane
taylor
b
was
born
in
london
her
mother
was
a
writer
of
some
note
in
connection
with
her
sister
ann
jane
taylor
wrote
several
juvenile
works
of
more
than
ordinary
excellence
among
them
were
hymns
for
infant
minds
and
original
poems
besides
these
she
wrote
display
a
tale
essays
in
rhyme
and
contributions
of
qq
her
writings
are
graceful
and
often
contain
a
useful
moral
an
old
dock
that
had
stood
for
fifty
years
in
a
farmer
kitchen
without
giving
its
owner
any
cause
of
complaint
early
one
morning
before
the
family
was
stirring
suddenly
stopped
upon
this
the
dial
plate
if
we
may
credit
the
fable
changed
countenance
with
alarm
the
hands
made
a
vain
effort
to
continue
their
course
the
wheels
remained
motionless
with
surprise
the
weights
hung
speechless
and
each
member
felt
disposed
to
lay
the
blame
on
the
others
at
length
the
dial
instituted
a
formal
inquiry
as
to
the
cause
of
the
stagnation
when
hands
wheels
weights
with
one
voice
protested
their
innocence
but
now
a
faint
tick
was
heard
below
from
the
pendulum
who
spoke
thus
i
confess
myself
to
be
the
sole
cause
of
the
present
stoppage
and
i
am
willing
for
the
general
satisfaction
to
assign
my
reasons
the
truth
is
that
i
am
tired
of
ticking
upon
hearing
this
the
old
clock
became
so
enraged
that
it
was
upon
the
very
point
of
striking
lazy
wire
exclaimed
the
dial
plate
holding
up
its
bands
very
good
replied
the
pendulum
it
is
vastly
easy
for
you
mistress
dial
who
have
always
as
everybody
knows
set
yourself
up
above
me
it
is
vastly
easy
for
you
i
say
to
accuse
other
people
of
laziness
you
who
have
had
nothing
to
do
all
your
life
but
to
stare
people
in
the
face
and
to
amuse
yourself
with
watching
all
that
goes
on
in
the
kitchen
think
i
beseech
you
how
you
would
like
to
be
shut
up
for
life
in
this
dark
closet
and
to
wag
backward
and
forward
year
after
year
as
i
do
as
to
that
said
the
dial
is
there
not
a
window
in
your
house
on
purpose
for
you
to
look
through
for
all
that
resumed
the
pendulum
it
is
very
dark
here
and
although
there
is
a
window
i
dare
not
stop
even
for
an
instant
to
look
out
at
it
besides
i
am
really
tired
of
my
way
of
life
and
if
you
wish
i
tell
you
how
i
took
this
disgust
at
my
employment
i
happened
this
morning
to
be
calculating
how
many
times
i
should
have
to
tick
in
the
course
of
only
the
next
hours
perhaps
some
one
of
you
above
there
can
give
me
the
exact
sum
the
minute
hand
being
quick
at
figures
presently
replied
thousand
four
hundred
times
exactly
so
replied
the
pendulum
well
i
appeal
to
you
all
if
the
very
thought
of
this
was
not
enough
to
fatigue
anyone
and
when
i
began
to
multiply
the
strokes
of
one
day
by
those
of
months
and
years
really
it
was
no
wonder
if
i
felt
discouraged
at
the
prospect
so
after
a
great
deal
of
reasoning
and
hesitation
thinks
i
to
myself
i
stop
the
dial
could
scarcely
keep
its
countenance
during
this
harangue
but
resuming
its
gravity
thus
replied
dear
pendulum
i
am
really
astonished
that
such
a
useful
industrious
person
as
yourself
should
have
been
seized
by
this
sudden
weariness
it
is
true
you
have
done
a
great
deal
of
work
in
your
time
so
have
we
all
and
are
likely
to
do
which
although
it
may
fatigue
us
to
think
of
the
question
is
whether
it
will
fatigue
us
to
do
would
you
now
do
me
the
favor
to
give
about
half
a
dozen
strokes
to
illustrate
my
argument
the
pendulum
complied
and
ticked
six
times
at
its
usual
pace
now
resumed
the
dial
may
i
be
allowed
to
inquire
if
that
exertion
is
at
all
fatiguing
or
disagreeable
to
you
not
in
the
least
replied
the
pendulum
it
is
not
of
six
strokes
that
i
complain
nor
of
sixty
but
of
millions
very
good
replied
the
dial
but
recollect
that
although
you
may
think
of
a
million
of
strokes
in
an
instant
you
are
required
to
execute
but
one
and
that
however
often
you
may
hereafter
have
to
swing
a
moment
will
always
be
given
you
to
swing
in
that
consideration
staggers
me
i
confess
said
the
pendulum
then
i
hope
resumed
the
dial
plate
that
we
shall
all
return
to
our
duty
immediately
for
the
maids
will
be
in
bed
if
we
stand
idling
thus
upon
this
the
weights
who
had
never
been
accused
of
light
conduct
used
all
their
influence
in
urging
him
to
proceed
when
as
if
with
one
consent
the
wheels
began
to
turn
the
hands
began
to
move
the
pendulum
began
to
swing
and
to
its
credit
ticked
as
loud
as
ever
while
a
red
beam
of
the
rising
sun
that
streamed
through
a
hole
in
the
kitchen
shining
full
upon
the
dial
plate
it
brightened
up
as
if
nothing
had
been
the
matter
when
the
farmer
came
down
to
breakfast
that
morning
upon
looking
at
the
clock
he
declared
that
his
watch
had
gained
half
an
hour
in
the
night
commenced
began
solemnly
declared
reckoning

to
which

the

of
the
year
of
wailing
winds
and
naked
woods

meadows
brown
and
sear
heaped
in
the
hollows
of
the

the
autumn
leaves
lie
dead
they
rustle
to
the
eddying
gust
and
to
the
rabbit

the
robin
and
the
wren
are
flown
and
from
the

the
jay
and
from
the
wood
top
calls
the
crow
through
all
the
gloomy
day
where
are
the
flowers
the
fair
young
flowers
that
lately
sprang
and
stood
in
brighter
light
and
softer
airs
a
beauteous
sisterhood
alas
they
all
are
in
their
graves
the
gentle
race
of
flowers
are
lying
in
their
lowly
beds
with
the
fair
and
good
of
ours
the
rain
is
falling
where
they
lie
but
the
cold
november
rain
calls
not
from
out
the
gloomy
earth
the
lovely
ones
again
the
windflower
and
the
violet
they
perished
long
ago
and
the
brier
rose
and
the
orchis
died
amid
the
summer
glow

on

the
and
the
aster
in

wood
and
the
yellow
sunflower
by

brook
in

beauty
stood
till
fell
the
frost
from
the
clear
cold
heaven
as
falls
the
plague
on
men
and
the
brightness
of
their
smile
was
gone
from
upland
glade
and
glen
and
now
when
comes
the
calm
mild
day
as
still
such
days
will
come
to
call
the
squirrel
and
the
bee
from
out
their
winter
home
when
the
sound
of
dropping
nuts
is
heard
though
all
the
trees
are
still
and
twinkle
in
the
smoky
light
the
waters
of
the
rill
the
south
wind
searches
for
the
flowers
whose
fragrance
late
he
bore
and
sighs
to
find
them
in
the
wood
and
by
the
stream
no
more
and
then
i
think
of
one
who
in
her
youthful
beauty
died
the
fair
meek
blossom
that
grew
up
and
faded
by
my
side
in
the
cold
moist
earth
we
laid
her
when
the
forest
cast
the
leaf
and
we
wept
that
one
so
lovely
should
have
a
life
so
brief
yet
not
unmeet
it
was
that
one
like
that

the
following
selection
is
from
dolph
in
bracehridge
hall
in
the
second
day
of
the
voyage
they
came
to
the
highlands
it
was
the
latter
part
of
a
calm
sultry
day
that
they
floated
gently
with
the
tide
between
these
stern
mountains
there
was
that
perfect
quiet
which
prevails
over
nature
in
the
languor
of
summer
heat
the
turning
of
a
plank
or
the
accidental
falling
of
an
oar
on
deck
was
echoed
from
the
mountain
side
and
reverberated
along
the
shores
and
if
by
chance
the
captain
gave
a
shout
of
command
there
were
airy
tongues
that
mocked
it
from
every
cliff
dolph
gazed
about
him
in
mute
delight
and
wonder
at
these
scenes
of
nature
magnificence
to
the
left
the
dunderberg
reared
its
woody
precipices
height
over
height
forest
over
forest
away
into
the
deep
summer
sky
to
the
right
strutted
forth
the
bold
promontory
of
nose
with
a
solitary
eagle
wheeling
about
it
while
beyond
mountain
succeeded
to
mountain
until
they
seemed
to
lock
their
arms
together
and
confine
this
mighty
rive
in
their
embraces
in
the
midst
of
this
admiration
dolph
remarked
a
pile
of
bright
snowy
clouds
peering
above
the
western
heights
it
was
succeeded
by
another
and
another
each
seemingly
pushing
onward
its
predecessor
and
towering
with
dazzling
brilliancy
in
the
deep
blue
atmosphere
and
now
muttering
peals
of
thunder
were
faintly
heard
rolling
behind
the
mountains
the
river
hitherto
still
and
glassy
reflecting
pictures
of
the
sky
and
land
now
showed
a
dark
ripple
at
a
distance
as
the
wind
came
creeping
up
it
the
fishhawks
wheeled
and
screamed
and
sought
their
nests
on
the
high
dry
trees
the
crows
flew
clamorously
to
the
crevices
of
the
rocks
and
all
nature
seemed
conscious
of
the
approaching
thunder
gust
the
clouds
now
rolled
in
volumes
over
the
mountain
tops
their
summits
still
bright
and
snowy
but
the
lower
parts
of
an
inky
blackness
the
rain
began
to
patter
down
in
broad
and
scattered
drops
the
wind
freshened
and
curled
up
the
waves
at
length
it
seemed
as
if
the
bellying
clouds
were
torn
open
by
the
mountain
tops
and
complete
torrents
of
rain
came
rattling
down
the
lightning
leaped
from
cloud
to
cloud
and
streamed
quivering
against
the
rocks
splitting
and
rending
the
stoutest
forest
trees
the
thunder
burst
in
tremendous
explosions
the
peals
were
echoed
from
mountain
to
mountain
they
crashed
upon
dunderberg
and
then
rolled
up
the
long
defile
of
the
highlands
each
headland
making
a
new
echo
until
old
bull
hill
seemed
to
bellow
back
the
storm
for
a
time
the
scudding
rack
and
mist
and
the
sheeted
rain
almost
hid
the
landscape
from
the
sight
there
was
a
fearful
gloom
illumined
still
more
fearfully
by
the
streams
of
lightning
which
glittered
among
the
raindrops
never
had
dolph
beheld
such
an
absolute
warring
of
the
elements
it
seemed
as
if
the
storm
was
tearing
and
rending
its
way
through
the

forth

and

down

the

the
tea
rose
there
it
stood
in
its
little
green
vase
on
a
light
ebony
stand
in
the
window
of
the
the
rich
satin
curtains
with
their
costly
fringes
swept
down
on
either
side
of
it
and
around
it
glittered
every
rare
and
fanciful
trifle
which
wealth
can
offer
to
luxury
and
yet
that
simple
rose
was
the
fairest
of
them
all
so
pure
it
looked
its
white
leaves
just
touched
with
that
delicious
creamy
tint
peculiar
to
its
kind
its
cup
so
full
so
perfect
its
head
bending
as
if
it
were
sinking
and
melting
away
in
its
own
oh
when
did
ever
man
make
anything
to
equal
the
living
perfect
flower
but
the
sunlight
that
streamed
through
the
window
revealed
something
fairer
than
the
rose
a
young
lady
reclining
on
an
ottoman
who
was
thus
addressed
by
her
livelier
cousin
i
say
cousin
i
have
been
thinking
what
you
are
to
do
with
your
pet
rose
when
you
go
to
new
york
as
to
our
consternation
you
are
determined
to
do
you
know
it
would
be
a
sad
pity
to
leave
it
with
such
a
as
i
am
i
love
flowers
indeed
that
is
i
like
a
regular
bouquet
cut
off
and
tied
up
to
carry
to
a
party
but
as
to
all
this
tending
and
fussing
which
is
needful
to
keep
them
growing
i
have
no
gifts
in
that
line
make
yourself
easy
as
to
that
kate
said
florence
with
a
smile
i
have
no
intention
of
calling
upon
your
talent
i
have
an
asylum
in
view
for
my
favorite
oh
then
you
know
just
what
i
was
going
to
say
marshall
i
presume
has
been
speaking
to
you
she
was
here
yesterday
and
i
was
quite
pathetic
upon
the
subject
telling
her
the
loss
your
favorite
would
sustain
and
so
forth
and
she
said
how
delighted
she
would
be
to
have
it
in
her
greenhouse
it
is
in
such
a
fine
state
now
so
full
of
buds
i
told
her
i
knew
you
would
like
to
give
it
to
her
you
are
so
fond
of
marshall
you
know
now
kate
i
am
sorry
but
i
have
otherwise
engaged
whom
can
it
be
to
you
have
so
few
intimates
here
oh
it
is
only
one
of
my
odd
fancies
but
do
tell
me
florence
well
cousin
you
know
the
little
pale
girl
to
whom
we
give
sewing
what
little
mary
stephens
how
absurd
florence
this
is
just
another
of
your
motherly
ways
dressing
dolls
for
poor
children
making
bonnets
and
knitting
socks
for
all
the
little
dirty
babies
in
the
neighborhood
i
do
believe
you
have
made
more
calls
in
those
two
vile
alleys
behind
our
house
than
ever
you
have
in
chestnut
street
though
you
know
everybody
is
half
dying
to
see
you
and
now
to
crown
all
you
must
give
this
choice
little
bijou
to
a
seamstress
girl
when
one
of
your
most
intimate
friends
in
your
own
class
would
value
it
so
highly
what
in
the
world
can
people
in
their
circumstances
want
with
flowers
just
the
same
as
i
do
replied
florence
calmly
have
you
not
noticed
that
the
little
girl
never
comes
without
looking
wistfully
at
the
opening
buds
and
do
you
remember
the
other
morning
she
asked
me
so
prettily
if
i
would
let
her
mother
come
and
see
it
she
was
so
fond
of
flowers
but
florence
only
think
of
this
rare
flower
standing
on
a
table
with
ham
eggs
cheese
and
flour
and
stifled
in
that
close
little
room
where
stephens
and
her
daughter
manage
to
wash
iron
and
cook
well
kate
and
if
i
were
obliged
to
live
in
one
coarse
room
and
wash
and
iron
and
cook
as
you
say
if
i
had
to
spend
every
moment
of
my
time
in
toil
with
no
prospect
from
my
window
but
a
brick
wall
and
a
dirty
lane
such
a
flower
as
this
would
be
untold
enjoyment
to
me
pshaw
florence
all
sentiment
poor
people
have
no
time
to
be
sentimental
besides
i
do
believe
it
will
grow
with
them
it
is
a
greenhouse
flower
and
used
to
delicate
living
oh
as
to
that
a
flower
never
inquires
whether
its
owner
is
rich
or
poor
and
poor
stephens
whatever
else
she
has
not
has
sunshine
of
as
good
quality
as
this
that
streams
through
our
window
the
beautiful
things
that
god
makes
are
his
gifts
to
all
alike
you
will
see
that
my
fair
rose
will
be
as
well
and
cheerful
in
stephens
room
as
in
ours
well
after
all
how
odd
when
one
gives
to
poor
people
one
wants
to
give
them
something
useful
a
bushel
of
potatoes
a
ham
and
such
things
why
certainly
potatoes
and
ham
must
be
supplied
but
having
ministered
to
the
first
and
most
craving
wants
why
not
add
any
other
little
pleasures
or
gratifications
we
may
have
it
in
our
power
to
bestow
i
know
there
are
many
of
the
poor
who
have
fine
feeling
and
a
keen
sense
of
the
beautiful
which
rusts
out
and
dies
because
they
are
too
hard
pressed
to
procure
it
any
gratification
poor
stephens
for
example
i
know
she
would
enjoy
birds
and
flowers
and
music
as
much
as
i
do
i
have
seen
her
eye
light
up
as
she
looked
upon
these
things
in
our
drawing
room
and
yet
not
one
beautiful
thing
can
she
command
from
necessity
her
room
her
clothing
all
she
has
must
be
coarse
and
plain
you
should
have
seen
the
almost
rapture
she
and
mary
felt
when
i
offered
them
my
rose
dear
me
all
this
may
be
true
but
i
never
thought
of
it
before
i
never
thought
that
these
people
had
any
ideas
of
taste
then
why
do
you
see
the
geranium
or
rose
so
carefully
nursed
in
the
old
cracked
teapot
in
the
poorest
room
or
the
planted
in
a
box
and
twined
about
the
window
do
not
these
show
that
the
human
heart
yearns
for
the
beautiful
in
all
ranks
of
life
you
remember
kate
how
our
washerwoman
sat
up
a
whole
night
after
a
hard
day
work
to
make
her
first
baby
a
pretty
dress
to
be
baptized
in
yes
and
i
remember
how
i
laughed
at
you
for
making
such
a
tasteful
little
cap
for
it
true
kate
but
i
think
the
look
of
perfect
delight
with
which
the
poor
woman
regarded
her
baby
in
its
new
dress
and
cap
was
something
quite
worth
creating
i
do
believe
she
could
not
have
felt
more
grateful
if
had
sent
her
a
barrel
of
flour
well
i
never
thought
before
of
giving
anything
to
the
poor
but
what
they
really
needed
and
i
have
always
been
willing
to
do
that
when
i
could
without
going
far
out
of
my
way
ah
cousin
if
our
heavenly
father
gave
to
us
after
this
mode
we
should
have
only
coarse
shapeless
piles
of
provisions
lying
about
the
world
instead
of
all
this
beautiful
variety
of
trees
and
fruits
and
flowers
well
well
cousin
i
suppose
you
are
right
but
have
mercy
on
my
poor
head
it
is
too
small
to
hold
so
many
new
ideas
all
at
once
so
go
on
your
own
way
and
the
little
lady
began
practicing
a
waltzing
step
before
the
glass

the
cataract
of
lodore
how
does
the
water
come
down
at
lodore
my
little
boy
asked
me
thus
once
on
a
time
and
moreover
he
tasked
me
to
tell
him
in
rhyme
anon
at
the
word
there
first
came
one
daughter
and
then
came
another
to
second
and
third
the
request
of
their
brother
and
to
hear
how
the
water
comes
down
at
lodore
with
its
rush
and
its
roar
as
many
a
time
they
had
seen
it
before
so
i
told
them
in
rhyme
for
of
rhymes
i
had
store
and
was
in
my
vocation
for
their
recreation
that
so
i
should
sing
because
i
was
laureate
to
them
and
the
king
from
its
sources
which
well
in
the
tarn
on
the
fell
from
its
fountains
in
the
mountains
its
rills
and
its
gills
through
moss
and
through
brake
it
runs
and
it
creeps
for
a
while
till
it
sleeps
in
its
own
little
lake
and
thence
at
departing
awakening
and
starting
it
runs
through
the
reeds
and
away
it
proceeds
through
meadow
and
glade
in
sun
and
in
shade
and
through
the
wood
shelter
among
crags
in
its
flurry
here
it
comes
sparkling
and
there
it
lies
darkling
now
smoking
and
frothing
its
tumult
and
wrath
in
till
in
this
rapid
race
on
which
it
is
bent
it
reaches
the
place
of
its
steep
descent
the
cataract
strong
then
plunges
along
striking
and
raging
as
if
a
war
waging
its
caverns
and
rocks
among
rising
and
leaping
sinking
and
creeping
swelling
and
sweeping
showering
and
springing

flinging
writhing

whisking
spouting
and

turning
and
twisting
around
and
around
with
endless
rebound
smiting
and
fighting
a
sight
to
delight
in
confounding
astounding
dizzying
and
deafening
the
ear
with
its
sound
collecting
projecting
receding
and
speeding
and
shocking
and
rocking
and
darting
and
parting
and
threading
and
spreading
and
whizzing
and
hissing
and

xxxix
the
bobolink
the
happiest
bird
of
our
spring
however
and
one
that
rivals
the
european
lark
in
my
estimation
is
the
boblincoln
or
bobolink
as
he
is
commonly
called
he
arrives
at
that
choice
portion
of
our
year
which
in
this
latitude
answers
to
the
description
of
the
month
of
may
so
often
given
by
the
poets
with
us
it
begins
about
the
middle
of
may
and
lasts
until
nearly
the
middle
of
june
earlier
than
this
winter
is
apt
to
return
on
its
traces
and
to
blight
the
opening
beauties
of
the
year
and
later
than
this
begin
the
parching
and
panting
and
dissolving
heats
of
summer
but
in
this
genial
interval
nature
is
in
all
her
freshness
and
fragrance
the
rains
are
over
and
gone
the
flowers
appear
upon
the
earth
the
time
of
the
singing
of
birds
is
come
and
the
voice
of
the
turtle
is
heard
in
the
land
the
trees
are
now
in
their
fullest
foliage
and
brightest
verdure
the
woods
are
gay
with
the
clustered
flowers
of
the
laurel
the
air
is
perfumed
with
the
sweetbrier
and
the
wild
rose
the
meadows
are
enameled
with
clover
blossoms
while
the
young
apple
peach
and
the
plum
begin
to
swell
and
the
cherry
to
glow
among
the
green
leaves
this
is
the
chosen
season
of
revelry
of
the
bobolink
he
comes
amid
the
pomp
and
fragrance
of
the
season
his
life
seems
all
sensibility
and
enjoyment
all
song
and
sunshine
he
is
to
be
found
in
the
soft
bosoms
of
the
freshest
and
sweetest
meadows
and
is
most
in
song
when
the
clover
is
in
blossom
he
perches
on
the
topmost
twig
of
a
tree
or
on
some
long
flaunting
weed
and
as
he
rises
and
sinks
with
the
breeze
pours
forth
a
succession
of
rich
tinkling
notes
crowding
one
upon
another
like
the
outpouring
melody
of
the
skylark
and
possessing
the
same
rapturous
character
sometimes
he
pitches
from
the
summit
of
a
tree
begins
his
song
as
soon
as
he
gets
upon
the
wing
and
flutters
tremulously
down
to
the
earth
as
if
overcome
with
ecstasy
at
his
own
music
sometimes
he
is
in
pursuit
of
his
mate
always
in
full
song
as
if
he
would
win
her
by
his
melody
and
always
with
the
same
appearance
of
intoxication
and
delight
of
all
the
birds
of
our
groves
and
meadows
the
bobolink
was
the
envy
of
my
boyhood
he
crossed
my
path
in
the
sweetest
weather
and
the
sweetest
season
of
the
year
when
all
nature
called
to
the
fields
and
the
rural
feeling
throbbed
in
every
bosom
but
when
i
luckless
urchin
was
doomed
to
be
mewed
up
during
the
day
in
a
schoolroom
it
seemed
as
if
the
little
varlet
mocked
at
me
as
he
flew
by
in
full
song
and
sought
to
taunt
me
with
his
happier
lot
oh
how
i
envied
him
no
lessons
no
task
no
school
nothing
but
holiday
frolic
green
fields
and
fine
weather
had
i
been
then
more
versed
in
poetry
i
might
have
addressed
him
in
the
words
of
logan
to
the
cuckoo
sweet
bird
thy
bower
is
ever
green
thy
sky
is
ever
clear
thou
hast
no
sorrow
in
thy
song
no
winter
in
thy
year
oh
could
i
fly
i
fly
with
thee
we
make
with
joyful
wing
our
annual
visit
the
globe
companions
of
the
spring
further
observation
and
experience
have
given
me
a
different
idea
of
this
feathered
voluptuary
which
i
will
venture
to
impart
for
the
benefit
of
my
young
readers
who
may
regard
him
with
the
same
unqualified
envy
and
admiration
which
i
once
indulged
i
have
shown
him
only
as
i
saw
him
at
first
in
what
i
may
call
the
poetical
part
of
his
career
when
he
in
a
manner
devoted
himself
to
elegant
pursuits
and
enjoyments
and
was
a
bird
of
music
and
song
and
taste
and
sensibility
and
refinement
while
this
lasted
he
was
sacred
from
injury
the
very
schoolboy
would
not
fling
a
stone
at
him
and
the
merest
rustic
would
pause
to
listen
to
his
strain
but
mark
the
difference
as
the
year
advances
as
the
clover
blossoms
disappear
and
the
spring
fades
into
summer
he
gradually
gives
up
his
elegant
tastes
and
habits
doffs
his
poetical
suit
of
black
assumes
a
russet
dusty
garb
and
sinks
to
the
gross
enjoyment
of
common
vulgar
birds
his
notes
no
longer
vibrate
on
the
ear
he
is
stuffing
himself
with
the
seeds
of
the
tall
weeds
on
which
he
lately
swung
and
chanted
so
melodiously
he
has
become
a
bon
vivant
a
gourmand
with
him
now
there
is
nothing
like
the
joys
of
the
table
in
a
little
while
he
grows
tired
of
plain
homely
fare
and
is
off
on
a
gastronomic
tour
in
quest
of
foreign
luxuries
we
next
hear
of
him
with
myriads
of
his
kind
banqueting
among
the
reeds
of
the
delaware
and
grown
corpulent
with
good
feeding
he
has
changed
his
name
in
traveling
boblincoln
no

is

gorges
himself

bursting

can

has
once
more
changed
his
name
and

with

the
favorite
bird
of

finally
a
gross
little
sensualist

expiates
his
sensuality
in

his
story
contains
a
moral
worthy
the
attention
of
all
little
birds
and
little
boys
warning
them
to
keep
to
those
refined
and
intellectual
pursuits
which
raised
him
to
so
high
a
pitch
of
popularity
during
the
early
part
of
his
career
but
to
eschew
all
tendency

that
gross
and

a

opposed

ferocity
under
the
most
appalling
circumstances
was
never
seen
than
that
which
was
witnessed
by
the
officers
of
our
state
prison
in
the
rebellion
which
occurred
some
years
since
three
convicts
had
been
sentenced
under
the
rules
of
the
prison
to
be
whipped
in
the
yard
and
by
some
effort
of
one
of
the
other
prisoners
a
door
had
been
opened
at
midday
communicating
with
the
great
dining
hall
and
through
the

lodge
with
the
street
the
dining
hall
was
long
dark
and
damp
from
its
situation
near
the
surface
of
the
ground
and
in
this
all
the
prisoners
assembled
with
clubs
and
such
other
tools
as
they
could
seize
in
passing
through
the
workshops
knives
hammers

chisels

the
ferocious

gathered
together
for

preventing
the
punishment
which
was
to
be
inflicted
on
the
morrow
upon
their
comrades
the
warden
the
surgeon
and
some
other
officers
of
the

were
there
at
the
time
and
were
alarmed
at
the
consequences
likely
to
ensue
from
the
conflict
necessary
to
restore
order
they
huddled
together
and
could
scarcely
be
said
to
consult
as
the
stoutest
among
them
lost
all
presence
of
mind
in
overwhelming
fear
the
news
rapidly
spread
through
the
town
and
a
subordinate
officer
of
the
most
mild
and
kind
disposition
hurried
to
the
scene
and
came
calm
and
collected
into
the
midst
of
the
officers
the
most
and
the
mildest
man
in
the
government
was
in
this
hour
of
peril
the
firmest
he
instantly
dispatched
a
request
to
major
wainright
commander
of
the
marines
stationed
at
the
navy
yard
for
assistance
and
declared
his
purpose
to
enter
into
the
hall
and
try
the
force
of
firm
demeanor
and
persuasion
upon
the
enraged
multitude
all
his
brethren
exclaimed
against
an
attempt
so
full
of
hazard
but
in
vain
they
offered
him
arms
a
sword
and
pistols
but
he
refused
them
and
said
that
he
had
no
fear
and
in
case
of
danger
arms
would
do
him
no
service
and
alone
with
only
a
little
rattan
which
was
his
usual
walking
stick
he
advanced
into
the
hall
to
hold
parley
with
the
selected
congregated
and
enraged
villains
of
the
whole
commonwealth
he
demanded
their
purpose
in
thus
coming
together
with
arms
in
violation
of
the
prison
laws
they
replied
that
they
were
determined
to
obtain
the
remission
of
the
punishment
of
their
three
comrades
he
said
it
was
impossible
the
rules
of
the
prison
must
be
obeyed
and
they
must
submit
at
the
hint
of
submission
they
drew
a
little
nearer
together
prepared
their
weapons
for
service
and
as
they
were
dimly
seen
in
the
further
end
of
the
hall
by
those
who
observed
from
the
gratings
that
opened
up
to
the
day
a
more
appalling
sight
can
not
be
conceived
nor
one
of
more
moral
grandeur
than
that
of
the
single
man
standing
within
their
grasp
and
exposed
to
be
torn
limb
from
limb
instantly
if
a
word
or
look
should
add
to
the
already
intense
excitement
that
excitement
too
was
of
a
most
dangerous
kind
it
broke
not
forth
in
noise
and
imprecations
but
was
seen
only
in
the
dark
looks
and
the
strained
nerves
that
showed
a
deep
determination
the
officer
expostulated
he
reminded
them
of
the
hopelessness
of
escape
that
the
town
was
alarmed
and
that
the
government
of
the
prison
would
submit
to
nothing
but
unconditional
surrender
he
said
that
all
those
who
would
go
quietly
away
should
be
forgiven
for
this
offense
but
that
if
every
prisoner
were
killed
in
the
contest
power
enough
would
be
obtained
to
enforce
the
regulations
of
the
prison
they
replied
that
they
expected
that
some
would
be
killed
that
death
would
be
better
than
such
imprisonment
and
with
that
look
and
tone
which
bespeak
an
indomitable
purpose
they
declared
that
not
a
man
should
leave
the
hall
alive
till
the
flogging
was
remitted
at
this
period
of
the
discussion
their
evil
passions
seemed
to
be
more
inflamed
and
one
or
two
offered
to
destroy
the
officer
who
still
stood
firmer
and
with
a
more
temperate
pulse
than
did
his
friends
who
saw
from
above
but
could
not
avert
the
danger
that
threatened
him
just
at
this
moment
and
in
about
fifteen
minutes
from
the
commencement
of
the
tumult
the
officer
saw
the
feet
of
the
marines
on
whose
presence
alone
he
relied
for
succor
filing
by
the
small
upper
lights
without
any
apparent
anxiety
he
had
repeatedly
turned
his
attention
to
their
approach
and
now
he
knew
that
it
was
his
only
time
to
escape
before
the
conflict
became
as
was
expected
one
of
the
most
dark
and
dreadful
in
the
world
he
stepped
slowly
backward
still
urging
them
to
depart
before
the
officers
were
driven
to
use
the
last
resort
of
firearms
when
within
three
or
four
feet
of
the
door
it
was
opened
and
closed
instantly
again
as
he
sprang
through
and
was
thus
unexpectedly
restored
to
his
friends
major
wainright
was
requested
to
order
his
men
to
fire
down
upon
the
convicts
through
the
little
windows
first
with
powder
and
then
with
ball
till
they
were
willing
to
retreat
but
he
took
a
wiser
as
well
as
a
bolder
course
relying
upon
the
effect
which
firm
determination
would
have
upon
men
so
critically
situated
he
ordered
the
door
to
be
again
opened
and
marched
in
at
the
head
of
twenty
or
thirty
men
who
filed
through
the
passage
and
formed
at
the
end
of
the
hall
opposite
to
the
crowd
of
criminals
huddled
together
at
the
other
he
stated
that
he
was
empowered
to
quell
the
rebellion
that
he
wished
to
avoid
shedding
blood
but
that
he
would
not
quit
that
hall
alive
till
every
convict
had
returned
to
his
duty
they
seemed
balancing
the
strength
of
the
two
parties
and
replied
that
some
of
them
were
ready
to
die
and
only
waited
for
an
attack
to
see
which
was
the
more
powerful
swearing
that
they
would
fight
to
the
last
unless
the
punishment
was
remitted
for
they
would
not
submit
to
any
such
punishment
in
the
prison
major
wainright
ordered
his
marines
to
load
their
pieces
and
that
they
might
not
be
suspected
of
trifling
each
man
was
made
to
hold
up
to
view
the
bullet
which
he
afterward
put
in
his
gun
this
only
caused
a
growl
of
determination
and
no
one
blenched
or
seemed
disposed
to
shrink
from
the
foremost
exposure
they
knew
that
their
number
would
enable
them
to
bear
down
and
destroy
the
handful
of
marines
after
the
first
discharge
and
before
their
pieces
could
be
reloaded
again
they
were
ordered
to
retire
but
they
answered
with
more
ferocity
than
ever
the
marines
were
ordered
to
take
their
aim
so
as
to
be
sure
and
kill
as
many
as
possible
their
guns
were
presented
but
not
a
prisoner
stirred
except
to
grasp
more
firmly
his
weapon
still
desirous
to
avoid
such
a
tremendous
slaughter
as
must
have
followed
the
discharge
of
a
single
gun
major
wainright
advanced
a
step
or
two
and
spoke
even
more
firmly
than
before
urging
them
to
depart
again
and
while
looking
directly
into
the
muzzles
of
the
guns
which
they
had
seen
loaded
with
ball
they
declared
their
intention
to
fight
it
out
this
intrepid
officer
then
took
out
his
watch
and
told
his
men
to
hold
their
pieces
aimed
at
the
convicts
but
not
to
fire
till
they
had
orders
then
turning
to
the
prisoners
he
said
you
must
leave
this
hall
i
give
you
three
minutes
to
decide
if
at
the
end
of
that
time
a
man
remains
he
shall
be
shot
dead
no
situation
of
greater
interest
than
this
can
be
conceived
at
one
end
of
the
hall
a
fearful
multitude
of
the
most
desperate
and
powerful
men
in
existence
waiting
for
the
assault
at
the
other
a
little
band
of
disciplined
men
waiting
with
arms
presented
and
ready
upon
the
least
motion
or
sign
to
begin
the
carnage
and
their
tall
and
imposing
commander
holding
up
his
watch
to
count
the
lapse
of
three
minutes
given
as
the
reprieve
to
the
lives
of
hundreds
no
poet
or
painter
can
conceive
a
spectacle
of
more
dark
and
terrible
sublimity
no
human
heart
can
conceive
a
situation
of
more
appalling
suspense
for
two
minutes
not
a
person
nor
a
muscle
moved
not
a
sound
was
heard
in
the
unwonted
stillness
of
the
prison
except
the
labored
breathings
of
the
infuriated
wretches
as
they
began
to
pant
between
fear
and
revenge
at
the
expiration
of
two
minutes
during
which
they
had
faced
the
ministers
of
death
with
unblenching
eyes
two
or
three

in

nearest

more

dropping
out
quietly
and
deliberately
and
before
half
of
the
last
minute
was
gone
every
man
was
struck
by
the
panic
and
crowded
for
an
exit
and
the
hall
was
cleared
as
if
by
magic
thus
the
steady
firmness
of
moral
force
and
the
strong

of
determination
acting

therefore
to
my
tale
in
those
days
i
lived
on
an
estate
not
far
from
simbirsk
and
though
but
a
child
i
have
not
forgotten
the
impression
made
on
my
mind
by
the
general
calamity
in
a
village
adjoining
lived
flor
silin
a
poor
laboring
peasant
a
man
remarkable
for
his
assiduity
and
the
skill
and
judgment
with
which
he
cultivated
his
lands
he
was
blessed
with
abundant
crops
and
his
means
being
larger
than
his
wants
his
granaries
even
at
this
time
were
full
of
corn
the
dry
year
coming
on
had
beggared
all
the
village
except
himself
here
was
an
opportunity
to
grow
rich
mark
how
flor
silin
acted
having
called
the
poorest
of
his
neighbors
about
him
he
addressed
them
in
the
following
manner
my
friends
you
want
corn
for
your
subsistence
god

blessed
me
with
abundance
assist
in
thrashing
out
a
quantity
and
each
of
you
take
what
he
wants
for
his
family
the
peasants
were
amazed
at
this
unexampled
generosity
for
sordid
propensities
exist
in
the
village
as
well
as
in
the
populous
city
the
fame
of
flor
silin
benevolence
having
reached
other
villages
the
famished
inhabitants
presented
themselves
before
him
and
begged
for
corn
this
good
creature
received
them
as
brothers
and
while
his
store
remained
afforded
all
relief
at
length
his
wife
seeing
no
end
to
the
generosity
of
his
noble
spirit
reminded
him
how
necessary
it
would
be
to
think
of
their
own
wants
and
hold
his
lavish
hand
before
it
was

the

the

forty
years

the

bubbled
the

low
was
once
so
high
that
we
could
almost
reach
and
kneeling
down
to
take
a
drink
dear
tom
i
started
so
to
think
how
very
much
i
changed
since
forty
years
ago
near
by
that
spring
upon
an
elm
you
know
i
cut
your
name
your
sweetheart
just
beneath
it
tom
and
you
did
mine
the
same
some
heartless
wretch
has
peeled
the
bark
was
dying
sure
but
slow
just
as
that
one
whose
name
you
cut
died
forty
years
ago
my
lids
have
long
been
dry
tom
but
tears
came
in
my
eyes
i
thought
of
her
i
loved
so
well
those
early
broken
ties
i
visited
the
old
churchyard
and
took
some
flowers
to
strew
upon
the
graves
of
those
we
loved
just
forty
years
ago
some
are
in
the
churchyard
laid
some
sleep
beneath
the
sea
and
none
are
left
of
our
old
class
excepting
you
and
me
and
when
our
time
shall
come
tom
and
we
are
called
to
go
i
hope
we
meet
with
those
we
loved
some
forty

ago

morning
there
you
need
begin

whistle
people
do
come
to
bed
to
whistle
but
it
like
you
i
ca
speak
that
you
do
try
to
insult
me
once
i
used
to
say
you
were
the
best
creature
living
now
you
get
quite
a
fiend
do
let
you
rest
no
i
wo
let
you
rest

only
time
i
have
to
talk
to
you
and
you
shall
hear
me
i
put
upon
all

long
it
very
hard
if
i
ca
speak
a
word
at
night
besides
it
is
often
i
open
my
mouth
goodness
knows
because
once
in
your
lifetime
your
shirt
wanted
a
button
you
must
almost
swear
the
roof
off
the
house
you
did
swear
ha
caudle
you
do
know
what
you
do
when
you
in
a
passion
you
were
not
in
a
passion
you
well
then
i
do
know
what
a
passion
is
and
i
think
i
ought
by
this
time
i
lived
long
enough
with
you
caudle
to
know
that
it
a
pity
you
something
worse
to
complain
of
than
a
button
off
your
shirt
if
you
some
wives
you
would
i
know
i
sure
i
never
without
a
needle
and
thread
in
my
hand
what
with
you
and
the
children
i
made
a
perfect
slave
of
and
what
my
thanks
why
if
once
in
your
life
a
button
off
your
shirt
what
do
you
cry
oh
at
i
say
once
caudle
or
twice
or
three
times
at
most
i
sure
caudle
no
buttons
in
the
world
are
better
looked
after
than
yours
i
only
wish
kept
the
shirts
you
had
when
you
were
first
married
i
should
like
to
know
where
were
your
buttons
then
yes
it
is
worth
talking
of
but
that
how
you
always
try
to
put
me
down
you
fly
into
a
rage
and
then
if
i
only
try
to
speak
you
wo
hear
me
that
how
you
men
always
will
have
all
the
talk
to
yourselves
a
poor
woman
is
allowed
to
get
a
word
in
a
nice
notion
you
have
of
a
wife
to
suppose
she
nothing
to
think
of
but
her
husband
buttons
a
pretty
notion
indeed
you
have
of
marriage
ha
if
poor
women
only
knew
what
they
had
to
go
through
what
with
buttons
and
one
thing
and
another
they
never
tie
themselves
up
no
not
to
the
best
man
in
the
world
i
sure
what
would
they
do
mr
caudle
why
do
much
better
without
you
i
certain
and
it
my
belief
after
all
that
the
button
was
off
the
shirt
it
my
belief
that
you
pulled
it
off
that
you
might
have
something
to
talk
about
oh
you
aggravating
enough
when
you
like
for
anything
all
i
know
is
it
very
odd
that
the
button
should
be
off
the
shirt
for
i
sure
no
woman
a
greater
slave
to
her
husband
buttons
than
i
am
i
only
say
it
very
odd
however
there
one
comfort
it
ca
last
long
i
worn
to
death
with
your
temper
and
trouble
you
a
great
while
ha
you
may
laugh
and
i
dare
say
you
would
laugh
i
no
doubt
of
it
that
your
love
that
your
feeling
i
know
that
i
sinking
every
day
though
i
say
nothing
about
it
and
when
i
gone
we
shall
see
how
your
second
wife
will
look
after
your
buttons
you
find
out
the
difference
then
yes
caudle
you
think
of
me
then
for
then
i
hope
you
never
have
a
blessed
button
to
your
back
no
i
not
a
vindictive
woman
caudle
nobody
ever
called
me
that
but
you
what
do
you
say
nobody
ever
knew
so
much
of
me
that
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
it
ha
i
would
have
your
aggravating
temper
caudle
for
mines
of
gold
it
a
good
thing
i
not
as
worrying
as
you
are
or
a
nice
house
there
be
between
us
i
only
wish
you
had
a
wife
that
would
have
talked
to
you
then
you
have
known
the
difference
but
you
impose
upon
me
because
like
a
poor
fool
i
say
nothing
i
should
be
ashamed
of
myself
caudle
and
a
pretty
example
you
set
as
a
father
you
make
your
boys
as
bad
as
yourself
talking
as
you
did
all
breakfast
time
about
your
buttons
and
of
a
sunday
morning
too
and
you
call
yourself
a
christian
i
should
like
to
know
what
your
boys
will
say
of
you
when
they
grow
up
and
all
about
a
paltry
button
off
one
of
your
wristbands
a
decent
man
would
have
mentioned
it
why
do
i
hold
my
tongue
because
i
wo
hold
my
tongue
i
to
have
my
peace
of
mind
destroyed
i
to
be
worried
into
my
grave
for
a
miserable
shirt
button
and
i
to
hold
my
tongue
oh
but
just
like
you
men
but
i
know
what
i
do
for
the
future
every
button
you
have
may
drop
off
and
i
wo
so
much
as
put
a
thread
to
and
i
should
like
to
know
what
you
do
then
oh
you
must
get
somebody
else
to
sew
must
you
that
a
pretty
threat
for
a
husband
to
hold
out
to
his
wife
and
to
such
a
wife
as
i
been
too
such
a
slave
to
your
buttons
as
i
may
say
somebody
else
to
sew
no
caudle
no
not
while
i
alive
when
dead
and
with
what
i
have
to
bear
there
no
knowing
how
soon
that
may
be
when
i
dead
i
say
oh
what
a
brute
you
must
be
to
snore
so
you
not
snoring
ha
that
what
you
always
say
but
that
nothing
to
do
with
it
you
must
get

else

must
you
ha
i
should
wonder

no
i
should

at
nothing

nothing
at

have
always
told
me
it
would
come
to
and
now

times
by

lady
the
wife
of
an
officer
at
lucknow
on
every
side
death
stared
us
in
the
face
no
human
skill
could
avert
it
any
longer
we
saw
the
moment
approach
when
we
must
bid
farewell
to
earth
yet
without
feeling
that
unutterable
horror
which
must
have
been
experienced
by
the
unhappy
victims
at
cawnpore
we
were
resolved
rather
to
die
than
to
yield
and
were
fully
persuaded
that
in
hours
all
would
be
over
the
engineer
had
said
so
and
all
knew
the
worst
we
women
strove
to
encourage
each
other
and
to
perform
the
light
duties
which
had
been
assigned
to
us
such
as
conveying
orders
to
the
batteries
and
supplying
the
men
with
provisions
especially
cups
of
coffee
which
we
prepared
day
and
night
i
had
gone
out
to
try
to
make
myself
useful
in
company
with
jessie
brown
the
wife
of
a
corporal
in
my
husband
regiment
poor
jessie
had
been
in
a
state
of
restless
excitement
all
through
the
siege
and
had
fallen
away
visibly
within
the
last
few
days
a
constant
fever
consumed
her
and
her
mind
wandered
occasionally
especially
that
day
when
the
recollections
of
home
seemed
powerfully
present
to
her
at
last
overcome
with
fatigue
she
lay
down
on
the
ground
wrapped
up
in
her
plaid
i
sat
beside
her
promising
to
awaken
her
when
as
she
said
her
father
should
return
from
the
plowing
she
fell
at
length
into
a
profound
slumber
motionless
and
apparently
breathless
her
head
resting
in
my
lap
i
myself
could
no
longer
resist
the
inclination
to
sleep
in
spite
of
the
continual
roar
of
the
cannon
suddenly
i
was
aroused
by
a
wild
unearthly
scream
close
to
my
ear
my
companion
stood
upright
beside
me
her
arms
raised
and
her
head
bent
forward
in
the
attitude
of
listening
a
look
of
intense
delight
broke
over
her
countenance
she
grasped
my
hand
drew
me
toward
her
and
exclaimed
dinna
ye
hear
it
dinna
ye
hear
it
ay
i
no
dreaming
it
the
slogan
o
the
highlanders
we
saved
we
saved
then
flinging
herself
on
her
knees
she
thanked
god
with
passionate
fervor
i
felt
utterly
bewildered
my
english
ears
heard
only
the
roar
of
artillery
and
i
thought
my
poor
jessie
was
still
raving
but
she
darted
to
the
batteries
and
i
heard
her
cry
incessantly
to
the
men
courage
courage
hark
to
the
slogan
to
the
macgregor
the
grandest
of
them
a
here
help
at
last
to
describe
the
effect
of
these
words
upon
the
soldiers
would
be
impossible
for
a
moment
they
ceased
firing
and
every
soul
listened
with
intense
anxiety
gradually
however
there
arose
a
murmur
of
bitter
disappointment
and
the
wailing
of
the
women
who
had
flocked
to
the
spot
burst
out
anew
as
the
colonel
shook
his
head
our
dull
lowland
ears
heard
only
the
battle
of
the
musketry
a
few
moments
more
of
this
deathlike
suspense
of
this
agonizing
hope
and
jessie
who
had
again
sunk
on
the
ground
sprang
to
her
feet
and
cried
in
a
voice
so
clear
and
piercing
that
it
was
heard
along
the
whole
line
will
ye
no
believe
it
noo
the
slogan
has
ceased
indeed
but
the
campbells
are
comin
d
ye
hear
d
ye
hear
at
that
moment
all
seemed
indeed
to
hear
the
voice
of
god
in
the
distance
when
the
pibroch
of
the
highlanders
brought
us
tidings
of
deliverance
for
now
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
of
the
fact
that
shrill
penetrating
ceaseless
sound
which
rose
above
all
other
sounds
could
come
neither
from
the
advance
of
the
enemy
nor
from
the
work
of
the
sappers
no
it
was
indeed
the
blast
of
the
scottish
bagpipes
now
shrill
and
harsh
as
threatening
vengeance
on
the
foe
then
in
softer
tones
seeming
to
promise
succor
to
their
friends
in
need
never
surely
was
there
such
a
scene
as
that
which
followed
not
a
heart
in
the
residency
of
lucknow
but
bowed
itself
before
god
all
by
one
simultaneous
impulse
fell
upon
their
knees
and
nothing
was
heard
but
bursting
sobs
and
the
murmured
voice
of
prayer
then
all
arose
and
there
rang
out
from
a
thousand
lips
a
great
shout
of
joy
which
resounded
far
and
wide
and
lent
new
vigor
to
that
blessed
pibroch
to
our
cheer
of
god
save
the
queen
they
replied
by
the
strain
that
moves
every
scot
to
tears

auld
acquaintance
be
forgot

that
nothing

any
impression
on
me

afterwards
studied
for

ministry

in
a
short
time
changed
his
plans

devoted
himself
to
literature
his
early
poems
are
quite
insignificant
but
the
seasons
from
which
the
following
selection
is
taken

the

are
masterpieces
of

poetry
through

xlix
behind
time
a
railroad
train
was
rushing
along
at
almost
lightning
speed
a
curve
was
just
ahead
beyond
which
was
a
station
where
two
trains
usually
met
the
conductor
was
late
so
late
that
the
period
during
which
the
up
train
was
to
wait
had
nearly
elapsed
but
he
hoped
yet
to
pass
the
curve
safely
suddenly
a
locomotive
dashed
into
sight
right
ahead
in
an
instant
there
was
a
collision
a
shriek
a
shock
and
fifty
souls
were
in
eternity
and
all
because
an
engineer
had
been
behind
time
a
great
battle
was
going
on
column
after
column
had
been
precipitated
for
eight
hours
on
the
enemy
posted
along
the
ridge
of
a
hill
the
summer
sun
was
sinking
in
the
west
reenforcements
for
the
obstinate
defenders
were
already
in
sight
it
was
necessary
to
carry
the
position
with
one
final
charge
or
everything
would
be
lost
a
powerful
corps
had
been
summoned
from
across
the
country
and
if
it
came
up
in
season
all
would
yet
be
well
the
great
conqueror
confident
in
its
arrival
formed
his
reserve
into
an
attacking
column
and
ordered
them
to
charge
the
enemy
the
whole
world
knows
the
result
grouchy
failed
to
appear
the
imperial
guard
was
beaten
back
and
waterloo
was
lost
napoleon
died
a
prisoner
at
helena
because
one
of
his
marshals
was
behind
time
a
leading
firm
in
commercial
circles
had
long
struggled
against
bankruptcy
as
it
had
large
sums
of
money
in
california
it
expected
remittances
by
a
certain
day
and
if
they
arrived
its
credit
its
honor
and
its
future
prosperity
would
be
preserved
but
week
after
week
elapsed
without
bringing
the
gold
at
last
came
the
fatal
day
on
which
the
firm
had
bills
maturing
to
large
amounts
the
steamer
was
telegraphed
at
daybreak
but
it
was
found
on
inquiry
that
she
brought
no
funds
and
the
house
failed
the
next
arrival
brought
nearly
half
a
million
to
the
insolvents
but
it
was
too
late
they
were
ruined
because
their
agent
in
remitting
had
been
behind
time
a
condemned
man
was
led
out
for
execution
he
had
taken
human
life
but
under
circumstances
of
the
greatest
provocation
and
public
sympathy
was
active
in
his
behalf
thousands
had
signed
petitions
for
a
reprieve
a
favorable
answer
had
been
expected
the
night
before
and
though
it
had
not
come
even
the
sheriff
felt
confident
that
it
would
yet
arrive
thus
the
morning
passed
without
the
appearance
of
the
messenger
the
last
moment
was
up
the
prisoner
took
his
place
the
cap
was
drawn
over
his
eyes
the
bolt
was
drawn
and
a
lifeless
body
swung
revolving
in
the
wind
just
at
that
moment
a
horseman
came
into
sight
galloping
down
hill
his
steed
covered
with
foam
he
carried
a
packet
in
his
right
hand
which
he
waved
frantically
to
the
crowd
he
was
the
express
rider
with
the
reprieve
but
he
came
too
late
a
comparatively
innocent
man
had
died
an
ignominious
death
because
a
watch
had
been
five
minutes
too
late
making
its
bearer
arrive
behind

it
is
continually

the

are
daily
sacrificed
because
somebody
is
behind

there
are

fail
in

because
they
are
behind

there
are

put
off

it

knows
how

william
cowper
b
was
the
son
of
an
english
clergyman
and
was
born
in
great
berkhamstead
hertfordshire
england
he
was
sent
to
westminster
school
when
he
was
ten
years
of
age
and
he
remained
there
a
diligent
student
eight
years
he
then
studied
law
and
was
admitted
to
the
bar
but
he
never
practiced
his
profession
he
was
appointed
to
a
clerkship
in
the
house
of
lords
when
he
was
about
thirty
years
old
but
he
never
entered
upon
the
discharge
of
his
duties
he
became
insane
and
was
sent
to
a
private
asylum
after
his
recovery
he
found
a
home
in
the
family
of
the
rev

on
the
death
of
this
gentleman
he
resided

death

works
his
insanity
returned
at
times
and
darkened
a
pure
and
gentle
life
at
its
close
between
nose
and
eyes
a
strange
contest
arose
the
spectacles
set
them
unhappily
wrong
the
point
in
dispute
was
as
all
the
world
knows
to
which
the
said
spectacles
ought
to
belong
so
tongue
was
the
lawyer
and
argued
the
cause
with
a
great
deal
of
skill
and
a
wig
full
of
learning
while
chief
baron
ear
sat
to
balance
the
laws
so
famed
for
his
talent
in
nicely
discerning
in
behalf
of
the
nose
it
will
quickly
appear
and
your
lordship
he
said
will
undoubtedly
find
that
the
nose
has
the
spectacles
always
to
wear
which
amounts
to
possession
time
out
of
mind
then
holding
the
spectacles
up
to
the
court
your
lordship
observes
they
are
made
with
a
straddle
as
wide
as
the
ridge
of
the
nose
is
in
short
designed
to
sit
close
to
it
just
like
a
saddle
again
would
your
lordship
a
moment
suppose
is
a
case
that
has
happened
and
may
happen
again
that
the
visage
or
countenance
had
not
a
nose
pray
who
would
or
who
could
wear
spectacles
then
on
the
whole
it
appears
and
my
argument
shows
with
a
reasoning
the
court
will
never
condemn
that
the
spectacles
plainly
were
made
for
the
nose
and
the
nose
was
as
plainly
intended
for
them
then
shifting
his
side
as
a
lawyer
knows
how
he
pleaded
again
in
behalf
of
the
eyes
but
what
were
his
arguments
few
people
know
for
the
court
did
not
think
them
equally
wise
so
his
lordship
decreed
with
a
grave
solemn
tone
decisive
and
clear
without
one
if
or
but
that
whenever
the
nose
put
his
spectacles
on
by
daylight
or
candlelight
eyes
should
be
shut

we
have
just
passed
a
fragment
of
some
one
of
the
surrounding
icebergs
that
had
amused
us
it
bore
the
resemblance
of
a
huge
polar
bear
reposing
upon
the
base
of
an
inverted
cone
with
a
twist
of
a
seashell
and
whirling
slowly
round
and
round
the
green
water
with
its
aerial
clearness
enabled
us
to
see
its
spiral
folds
and
horns
as
they
hung
suspended
in
the
deep
the
bear
a
mass
in
tolerable
proportion
seemed
to
be
regularly
beset
by
a
pack
of
hungry
little
swells
first
one
would
take
him
on
the
haunch
then
whip
back
into
the
sea
over
his
tail
and
between
his
legs
presently
a
bolder
swell
would
rise
and
pitch
into
his
back
with
a
ferocity
that
threatened
instant
destruction
it
only
washed
his
satin
fleece
the
whiter
while
bruin
was
turning
to
look
the
daring
assailant
in
the
face
the
rogue
had
pitched
himself
back
into
his
cave
no
sooner
that
than
a
very
bulldog
of
a
billow
would
attack
him
in
the
face
the
serenity
with
which
the
impertinent
assault
was
borne
was
complete
it
was
but
a
puff
of
silvery
dust
powdering
his
mane
with
fresher
brightness
nothing
would
be
left
of
bull
but
a
little
froth
of
all
the
foam
displayed
in
the
fierce
onset
he
too
would
turn
and
scud
into
his
hiding
place
persistent
little
waves
after
a
dash
singly
all
around
upon
the
common
enemy
as
if
by
some
silent
agreement
underwater
they
would
all
rush
on
at
once
with
their
loudest
roar
and
shaggiest
foam
and
overwhelm
poor
bear
so
completely
that
nothing
less
might
be
expected
than
to
behold
him
broken
in
four
quarters
and
floating
helplessly
asunder
mistaken
spectators
although
by
his
momentary
rolling
and
plunging
he
was
evidently
aroused
yet
neither
bruin
nor
his
burrow
was
at
all
the
worse
for
all
the
wear

washing
the
deep

wrinkled
folds
and

up
under

berg
as
closely
as
we
dare
to
our
delight
what
we
have
been
wishing

watching
for
is
actually
taking
place
loud
explosions
with
heavy
falls
of

the
roar

high

away

crested
with
sparkling
foam

it
is

the
effect
upon
the

precipice
of

with
tremendous
cracking
is
falling
toward
us
with
a
majestic
and
awful
motion

up
up

higher
and
higher
still
crossing
the
very
breast

bathed
with
rivulets
of
gleaming
foam
over
goes
the
summit

and
all
standing
off
obliquely
in

now
it
pauses
in
its
upward
roll
back
it
comes
again
cracking
cracking
cracking
groaning
out
harsh
thunder
as
it
comes
and
threatening
to
burst
like
a

bomb
into
millions
of
glittering
fragments
the
spectacle
is
terrific
and
magnificent

is
irrepressible

about
one
eighth
of
an
iceberg
appears
above
the
surface
of
the
water
when
one
side
of
it
grows
heavier
than
another
through
unequal
melting
and
the
action
of
the
waves

whole
mass
rolls
over

about
quail
william
post
hawes
b
was
born
in
new
york
city
and
was
a
graduate
of
columbia
college
he
was
a
lawyer
by
profession
his
writings
consist
mainly
of
essays
contributed
to
various
newspapers
and
magazines
and
show
great
descriptive
power
he
was
a
frequent
contributor
to
the
spirit
of
the
times
under
the
title
of
cypress
on
various
sporting
topics
after
his
death
a
collection
of
his
writings
was
published
in
two
volumes
entitled
sporting
scenes
and
sundry
sketches
the
quail
is
peculiarly
a
domestic
bird
and
is
attached
to
his
birthplace
and
the
home
of
his
forefathers
the
various
members
of
the
aquatic
families
educate
their
children
in
the
cool
summer
of
the
far
north
and
bathe
their
warm
bosoms
in
july
in
the
iced
waters
of
hudson
bay
but
when
boreas
scatters
the
rushes
where
they
had
builded
their
bedchambers
they
desert
their
fatherland
and
fly
to
disport
in
the
sunny
waters
of
the
south
the
songsters
of
the
woodland
when
their
customary
crops
of
insects
and
berries
are
cut
off
in
the
fall
gather
themselves
to
renew
their
loves
and
get
married
in
more
genial
climes
presently
the
groves
so
vocal
and
the
sky
so
full
shall
be
silent
and
barren
the
melancholy
days
will
soon
be
here
only
thou
dear
bob
white
wilt
remain
the
quail
is
the
bird
for
me
he
is
no
rover
no
emigrant
he
stays
at
home
and
is
identified
with
the
soil
where
the
farmer
works
he
lives
and
loves
and
whistles
in
budding
springtime
and
in
scorching
summer
in
bounteous
autumn
and
in
barren
winter
his
voice
is
heard
from
the
same
bushy
hedge
fence
and
from
his
customary
cedars
cupidity
and
cruelty
may
drive
him
to
the
woods
and
to
seek
more
quiet
seats
but
be
merciful
and
kind
to
him
and
he
will
visit
your
barnyard
and
sing
for
you
upon
the
boughs
of
the
apple
tree
by
your
gateway
when
warm
may
first
wooes
the
young
flowers
to
open
and
receive
her
breath
then
begin
the
cares
and
responsibilitie
of
wedded
life
away
fly
the
happy
pair
to
seek
some
grassy
tussock
where
safe
from
the
eye
of
the
hawk
and
the
nose
of
the
fox
they
may
rear
their
expectant
brood
in
peace
oats
harvest
arrives
and
the
fields
are
waving
with
yellow
grain
now
be
wary
o
cradler
and
tread
not
into
those
pure
white
eggs
ready
to
burst
with
life
soon
there
is
a
peeping
sound
heard
and
lo
a
proud
mother
walketh
magnificently
in
the
midst
of
her
children
scratching
and
picking
and
teaching
them
how
to
swallow
happy
she
if
she
may
be
permitted
to
bring
them
up
to
maturity
and
uncompelled
to
renew
her
joys
in
another
nest
the
assiduities
of
a
mother
have
a
beauty
and
a
sacredness
about
them
that
command
respect
and
reverence
in
all
animal
nature
human
or
inhuman
what
a
lie
does
that
word
carry
except
perhaps
in
monsters
insects
and
fish
i
never
yet
heard
of
the
parental
tenderness
of
a
trout
eating
up
his
little
baby
nor
of
the
filial
gratitude
of
a
spider
nipping
the
life
out
of
his
father
and
usurping
his
web
but
if
you
would
see
the
purest
the
sincerest
the
most
affecting
piety
of
a
parent
love
startle
a
young
family
of
quails
and
watch
the
conduct
of
the
mother
she
will
not
leave
you
no
not
she
but
she
will
fall
at
your
feet
uttering
a
noise
which
none
but
a
distressed
mother
can
make
and
she
will
run
and
flutter
and
seem
to
try
to
be
caught
and
cheat
your
outstretched
hand
and
affect
to
be
and
wounded
and
yet
have
just
strength
to
tumble
along
until
she
has
drawn
you
fatigued
a
safe
distance
from
her
threatened
children
and
the
young
hopes
of
her
heart
and
then
will
she
mount
whirring
with
glad
strength
and
away
through
the
maze
of
trees
you
have
not
seen
before
like
a
bullet
fly
to
her
skulking
infants
listen
now
do
you
hear
those
three
notes
quickly
and
clearly
poured
out
she
is
calling
the
boys
and
girls
together
she
sings
not
now
bob
white
nor
ah
bob
white
that
is
her
husband
love
call
or
his
trumpet
blast
of
defiance
but
she
calls
sweetly
and
softly
for
her
lost
children
hear
them
peep
peep
peep
at
the
welcome
voice
of
their
mother
love
they
are
coming
together
soon
the
whole
family
will
meet
again
it
is
a
foul
sin
to
disturb
them
but
retread
your
devious
way
and
let
her
hear
your
coming
footsteps
breaking
down
the
briers
as
you
renew
the
danger
she
is
quiet
not
a
word
is
passed
between
the
fearful
fugitives
now
if
you
have
the
heart
to
do
it
lie
low
keep
still
and
imitate
the
call
of
the
hen
quail
o
mother
mother
how
your
heart
would
die
if
you
could
witness
the
deception
the
little
ones
raise
up
their
trembling
heads
and
catch
comfort
and
imagined
safety
from
the
sound
peep
peep
they
come
to
you
straining
their
little
eyes
and
clustering
together
and
answering
seem
to
say
where
is
she
mother
mother
we
are
here
frequenting
the
water
having
a
voice
united
eager
desire
to
possess
something

tuft
of
grass
or
twigs

who
uses
a

is

the
flow
of
the
inland
river
whence
the

have
fled

the
blades
of
the

for

under

with

when

the
above
touching
little
poem
first
appeared
in
the
atlantic
monthly
in
september
it
commemorates
the
noble
action
on
the
part
of
the
women
at
columbus
who
in
decorating
the
graves
strewed
flowers
impartially
on
those
of
the
confederate
and
of
the
federal
soldiers
lix
the
machinist
return
adapted
from
a
letter
written
by
a
correspondent
of
the
washington
capital
on
our
way
from
springfield
to
boston
a
stout
man
sat
immediately
in
front
of
me
in
the
car
whose
maneuvers
were
a
source
of
constant
amusement
he
would
get
up
every
five
minutes
hurry
away
to
the
narrow
passage
leading
to
the
door
of
the
car
and
commence
laughing
in
the
most
violent
manner
continuing
that
healthful
exercise
until
he
observed
that
some
one
was
watching
him
when
he
would
return
to
his
seat
as
we
neared
boston
these
demonstrations
increased
in
frequency
and
violence
but
the
stranger
kept
his
seat
and
chuckled
to
himself
he
shifted
the
position
of
his
two
portmanteaus
or
placed
them
on
the
seat
as
if
he
was
getting
ready
to
leave
as
we
were
at
least
miles
from
boston
such
early
preparations
seemed
extremely
ridiculous
he
became
so
excited
at
last
that
he
could
not
keep
his
secret
some
one
must
be
made
a
confidant
and
as
i
happened
to
be
the
nearest
to
him
he
selected
me
turning
around
suddenly
and
rocking
himself
to
and
fro
in
his
chair
he
said
i
have
been
away
from
home
three
years
have
been
in
europe
my
folks
do
expect
me
for
three
months
yet
but
i
got
through
and
started
i
telegraphed
them
at
the
last
station
they
got
the
dispatch
by
this
time
as
he
said
this
he
rubbed
his
hands
and
changed
the
portmanteau
on
his
left
to
the
right
and
then
the
one
on
the
right
to
the
left
have
you
a
wife
said
i
yes
and
three
children
was
the
answer
he
then
got
up
and
folded
his
overcoat
anew
and
hung
it
over
the
back
of
the
seat
you
are
somewhat
nervous
just
now
are
you
not
said
i
well
i
should
think
so
he
replied
i
have
slept
soundly
for
a
week
do
you
know
he
went
on
speaking
in
a
low
tone
i
am
almost
certain
this
train
will
run
off
the
track
and
break
my
neck
before
i
get
to
boston
i
have
had
too
much
good
luck
lately
for
one
man
it
last
it
rains
so
hard
sometimes
that
you
think
it
never
going
to
stop
then
it
shines
so
bright
you
think
it
always
going
to
shine
and
just
as
you
are
settle
in
either
belief
you
are
knocked
over
by
a
change
to
show
you
that
you
know
nothing
about
it
well
according
to
your
philosophy
i
said
you
will
continue
to
have
sunshine
because
you
are
expecting
a
storm
perhaps
so
he
replied
but
it
is
curious
that
the
only
thing
which
makes
me
think
i
shall
get
through
safe
is
i
fear
that
i
shall
not
i
am
a
machinist
he
continued
i
made
a
discovery
nobody
believed
in
it
i
spent
all
my
money
in
trying
to
bring
it
out
i
mortgaged
my
home
everything
went
everybody
laughed
at
me
everybody
but
my
wife
she
said
she
would
work
her
fingers
off
before
i
should
give
it
up
i
went
to
england
at
first
i
met
with
no
encouragement
whatever
and
came
very
near
jumping
off
london
bridge
i
went
into
a
workshop
to
earn
money
enough
to
come
home
with
there
i
met
the
man
i
wanted
to
make
a
long
story
short
i
brought
home
pounds
with
me
and
here
i
am
good
i
exclaimed
yes
said
he
and
the
best
of
it
is
she
knows
nothing
about
it
she
has
been
disappointed
so
often
that
i
concluded
i
would
not
write
to
her
about
my
unexpected
good
luck
when
i
got
my
money
though
i
started
for
home
at
once
and
now
i
suppose
you
will
make
her
happy
happy
he
replied
why
you
do
know
anything
about
it
she
worked
night
and
day
since
i
have
been
in
england
trying
to
support
herself
and
the
children
decently
they
paid
her
thirteen
cents
apiece
for
making
shirts
and
that
the
way
she
has
lived
half
the
time
she
come
down
to
the
depot
to
meet
me
in
a
gingham
dress
and
a
shawl
a
hundred
years
old
and
she
think
dressed
up
perhaps
she
wo
have
any
fine
dresses
in
a
week
or
so
eh
the
stranger
then
strode
down
the
passageway
again
and
getting
in
a
corner
where
he
seemed
to
suppose
that
he
was
out
of
sight
went
through
the
strangest
pantomime
laughing
putting
his
mouth
into
the
drollest
shapes
and
swinging
himself
back
and
forth
in
the
limited
space
as
the
train
was
going
into
the
depot
i
placed
myself
on
the
platform
of
the
car
in
front
of
the
one
in
which
i
had
been
riding
and
opposite
the
stranger
who
with
a
portmanteau
in
each
hand
was
standing
on
the
lowest
step
ready
to
jump
to
the
ground
i
looked
from
his
face
to
the
faces
of
the
people
before
us
but
saw
no
sign
of
recognition
suddenly
he
cried
there
they
are
then
he
laughed
outright
but
in
a
hysterical
way
as
he
looked
over
the
crowd
in
front
of
him
i
followed
his
eye
and
saw
some
distance
back
as
if
crowded
out
by
the
and
elbowing
throng
a
little
woman
in
a
faded
dress
and
a
hat
with
a
face
almost
painful
in
its
intense
but
hopeful
expression
glancing
rapidly
from
window
to
window
as
the
coaches
passed
by
she
had
not
seen
the
stranger
but
a
moment
after
she
caught
his
eye
in
another
instant
he
had
jumped
to
the
platform
with
his
two
portmanteaus
and
pushing
his
way
through
the
crowd
he
rushed
towards
the
place
where
she
was
standing
i
think
i
never
saw
a
face
assume
so
many
different
expressions
in
so
short
a
time
as
did
that
of
the
little
woman
while
her
husband
was
on
his
way
to
meet
her
she
was
not
pretty
on
the
contrary
she
was
very
but
somehow
i
felt
a
big
lump
rise
in
my
throat
as
i
watched
her
she
was
trying
to
laugh
but
god
bless
her
how
completely
she
failed
in
the
attempt
her
mouth
got
into
the
position
to
laugh
but
it
never
moved
after
that
save
to
draw
down
at
the
corners
and
quiver
while
her
eyes
blinked
so
fast
that
i
suspect
she
only
caught
occasional
glimpses
of
the
fellow
who
elbowed
his
way
so
rapidly
toward
her
as
he
drew
close
and
dropped
the
portmanteaus
she
turned
to
one
side
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
thus
she
was
when
the
strong
man
gathered
her
up
in
his
arms
as
if
she
were
a
child
and
held
her
sobbing
to
his
breast
there
were
enough
staring
at
them
heaven
knows
so
i
turned
my
eyes
away
a
moment
and
then
i
saw
two
boys
in
threadbare
roundabouts
standing
near
wiping
their
eyes
on
their
sleeves
and
bursting
into
tears
anew
at
every
fresh
demonstration
on
the
part
of
their
mother
when
i
looked
at
the
stranger
again
he
had
his
hat
drawn
over
his
eyes
but
his
wife
was
looking
up
at
him
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
tears
of
those
weary
months
of
waiting
were
streaming
through
her
eyelids

style
is
generally
too
diffuse
but
its
smoothness
and
the
evident
sincerity
of
his
emotions
have
made
many
of
his
hymns
and
minor
poems
very
popular
a
pension
of
pounds

year
was
granted
to
him
in

cried

for

and
died

phalanx
stood
a
living
wall
a
human
wood
a
wall
where
every
conscious
stone
seemed
to
its
kindred
thousands
grown
a
rampart
all
assaults
to
bear
till
time
to
dust
their
frames
should
wear
a
wood
like
that
enchanted
grove
in
which
with
fiends
rinaldo
strove
where
every
silent
tree
possessed
a
spirit
prisoned
in
its
breast
which
the
first
stroke
of
coming
strife
would
startle
into
hideous
life
so
dense
so
still
the
austrians
stood
a
living
wall
a
human
wood
impregnable
their
front
appears
all
horrent
with
projected
spears
whose
polished
points
before
them
shine
from
flank
to
flank
one
brilliant
line
bright
as
the
breakers
splendors
run
along
the
billows
to
the
sun
opposed
to
these
a
hovering
band
contending
for
their
native
laud
peasants
whose
strength
had
broke
from
manly
necks
the
ignoble
yoke
and
forged
their
fetters
into
swords
on
equal
terms
to
fight
their
lords
and
what
insurgent
rage
had
gained
in
many
a
mortal
fray
maintained
marshaled
once
more
at
freedom
call
they
came
to
conquer
or
to
fall
where
he
who
conquered
he
who
fell
was
deemed
a
dead
or
living
tell
and
now
the
work
of
life
and
death
hung
on
the
passing
of
a
breath
the
fire
of
conflict
burned
within
the
battle
trembled
to
begin
yet
while
the
austrians
held
their
ground

for
attack
was
nowhere

the
impatient
switzers
gazed
the
unbroken
line
of
lances
blazed
that
line

suicide
to
meet
and
perish
at
their
tyrants
feet
how
could
they
rest
within
their
graves
and
leave
their
homes
the
home
of
slaves
would
they
not
feel
their
children
tread
with
clanking
chains
above
their
head

not

can

hung

behold
him
arnold
winkelried
there
sounds
not
to
the
trump
of
fame
the
echo
of
a
nobler
name
unmarked
he
stood
amid
the
throng
in
rumination
deep
and
long
till
you
might
see
with
sudden
grace
the
very
thought
come
his
face
and
by
the
motion
of
his
form
anticipate
the
bursting
storm
and
by
the
uplifting
of
his
brow
tell
where
the
bolt
would
strike
and
how
but
was
no
sooner
thought
than
done
the
field
was
in
a
moment
won
make
way
for
liberty
he
cried
then
ran
with
arms
extended
wide
as
if
his
dearest
friend
to
clasp
ten
spears
he
swept
within
his
grasp
make
way
for
liberty
he
cried
their
keen
points
met
from
side
to
side
he
bowed
among
them
like
a
tree
and
thus
made
way
for
liberty
swift
to
the
breach
his
comrades
fly

instantaneous

like

love
it
is
the
living
ecstasy
of
joy
when
it
mounts
up
into
its
glorious
privacy
of
light
on
the
earth
it
is
timid
silent
and
bashful
as
if
not
at
home
and
not
sure
of
its
right
to
be
there
at
all
it
is
rather
homely
withal
having
nothing
in
feather
feature
or
form
to
attract
notice
it
is
seemingly
made
to
be
heard
not
seen
reversing
the
old
axiom
addressed
to
children
when
getting
noisy
its
mission
is
music
and
it
floods
a
thousand
acres
of
the
blue
sky
with
it
several
times
a
day
out
of
that
palpitating
speck
of
living
joy
there
wells
forth
a
sea
of
twittering
ecstasy
upon
the
morning
and
evening
air
it
does
not
ascend
by
gyrations
like
the
eagle
and
birds
of
prey
it
mounts
up
like
a
human
aspiration
it
seems
to
spread
its
wings
and
to
be
lifted
straight
upwards
out
of
sight
by
the
afflatus
of
its
own
happy
heart
to
pour
out
this
in
undulating
rivulets
of
rhapsody
is
apparently
the
only
motive
of
its
ascension
this
it
is
that
has
made
it
so
loved
of
all
generations
it
is
the
singing
angel
of
man
nearest
heaven
whose
vital
breath
is
music
its
sweet
warbling
is
only
the
metrical
palpitation
of
its
life
of
joy
it
goes
up
over
the
rooftrees
of
the
rural
hamlet
on
the
wings
of
its
song
as
if
to
train
the
human
soul
to
trial
flights
heavenward
never
did
the
creator
put
a
voice
of
such
volume
into
so
small

thing
it
is
a
marvel
almost
a
miracle

hour

can
hear
it

i
give
my
hand
and
my
heart
to
this
vote
it
is
true
indeed
that
in
the
beginning
we
aimed
not
at
independence
but
there
a
divinity
that
shapes
our
ends
the
injustice
of
england
has
driven
us
to
arms
and
blinded
to
her
own
interest
she
has
obstinately
persisted
till
independence
is
now
within
our
grasp
we
have
but
to
reach
forth
to
it
and
it
is
ours
why
then
should
we
defer
the
declaration
is
any
man
so
weak
as
now
to
hope
for
a
reconciliation
with
england
which
shall
leave
either
safety
to
the
country
and
its
liberties
or
security
to

sit

not
both
already
the
proscribed
and
predestined
objects
of
punishment
and
of
vengeance

off
from
all
hope
of
royal
clemency
what
are
you
what
can
you
be
while
the
power
of
england
remains
but
outlaws
if
we
postpone
independence
do
we
mean
to
carry
on
or
to
give
up
the
war
do
we
mean
to
submit
and
consent
that
we
shall
be
ground
to
powder
and
our
country
and
its
rights
trodden
down
in
the
dust
i
know
we
do
not
mean
to
submit
we
never
shall
submit
do
we
intend
to
violate
that
most
solemn
obligation
ever
entered
into
by
men
that
plighting
before
god
of
our
sacred
honor
to
washington
when
putting
him
forth
to
incur
the
dangers
of
war
as
well
as
the
political
hazards
of
the
times
we
promised
to
adhere
to
him
in
every
extremity
with
our
fortunes
and
our
lives
i
know
there
is
not
a
man
here
who
would
not
rather
see
a
general
conflagration
sweep
over
the
land
or
an
earthquake
sink
it
than
one
jot
or
tittle
of
that
plighted
faith
fall
to
the
ground
for
myself
having
twelve
months
ago
in
this
place
moved
you
that
george
washington
be
appointed
commander
of
the
forces
raised
or
to
be
raised
for
the
defense
of
american
liberty
may
my
right
hand
forget
her
cunning
and
my
tongue
cleave
to
the
roof
of
my
mouth
if
i
hesitate
or
waver
in
the
support
i
give
him
the
war
then
must
go
on
we
must
fight
it
through
and
if
the
war
must
go
on
why
put
off
the
declaration
of
independence
that
measure
will
strengthen
us
it
will
give
us
character
abroad
nations
will
then
treat
with
us
which
they
never
can
do
while
we
acknowledge
ourselves
subjects
in
arms
against
our
sovereign
nay
i
maintain
that
england
herself
will
sooner
treat
for
peace
with
us
on
the
footing
of
independence
than
consent
by
repealing
her
acts
to
acknowledge
that
her
whole
conduct
toward
us
has
been
a
course
of
injustice
and
oppression
her
pride
will
be
less
wounded
by
submitting
to
that
course
of
things
which
now
predestinates
our
independence
than
by
yielding
the
points
in
controversy
to
her
rebellious
subjects
the
former
she
would
regard
as
the
result
of
fortune
the
latter
she
would
feel
as
her
own
deep
disgrace
why
then
do
we
not
change
this
from
a
civil
to
a
national
war
and
since
we
must
fight
it
through
why
not
put
ourselves
in
a
state
to
enjoy
all
the
benefits
of
victory
if
we
gain
the
victory
if
we
fail
it
can
be
no
worse
for
us
but
we
shall
not
fail
the
cause
will
raise
up
armies
the
cause
will
create
navies
the
people
the
people
if
we
are
true
to
them
will
carry
us
and
will
carry
themselves
gloriously
through
this
struggle
i
care
not
how
fickle
other
people
have
been
found
i
know
the
people
of
these
colonies
and
i
know
that
resistance
to
british
aggression
is
deep
and
settled
in
their
hearts
and
can
not
be
eradicated
sir
the
declaration
of

will
inspire
the
people
with
increased
courage

and
bloody

king
set
before
them

glorious
object

independence
and
it
will
breathe
into
them
anew
the
spirit
of
life
read
this

at

sword
will
be
drawn

solemn
vow
uttered
to
maintain
it

will
approve
it
and

love
of

liberty
will
cling
around
it
resolved
to
stand
with
it
or
fall
with
it
send
it

their
brothers
and
their
sons
fall
on
the
field
of
bunker
hill
and
in
the
streets
of
lexington
and
concord
and

will
cry
out
in
its
support

uncertainty
of
human
affairs

through

business
you

rue

be
assured

this
declaration
will
stand
it
may
cost
treasure

it

cost

it
will
stand

richly
compensate

will
shed

tears
not
of
subjection

not
of
agony

of
exultation
of

the

selection

abridged
from
the
wagoner
of
the

out
of
the
north
the
wild
news
came
far
flashing
on
its
wings
of
flame
swift
as
the
boreal
light
which
flies
at
midnight
through
the
startled
skies
and
there
was
tumult
in
the
air
the
fife
shrill
note
the
drum
loud
beat
and
through
the
wide
land
everywhere
the
answering
tread
of
hurrying
feet
while
the
first
oath
of
freedom
gun
came
on
the
blast
from
lexington
and
concord
roused
no
longer
tame
forgot
her
old
baptismal
name
made
bare
her
patriot
arm
of
power
and
swelled
the
discord
of
the
hour

and
the

son
with
knitted
brows
and

the

and
oft
the

there
while
kneeling
in

long
poured
with

the
lead
into
the
molds
of
death
the
hands
by

made
silken
soft
to
soothe
the
brow
of
love
or
pain
alas
are
dulled
and
soiled
too
oft
by
some
unhallowed
earthly
stain
but
under
the
celestial
bound
no
nobler
picture
can
be
found
than
woman
brave
in
word
and
deed
thus
serving
in
her
nation

her
love
is
with
her
country
now
her
hand
is
on
its
aching
brow
within
its
shade
of
elm
and
oak
the
church
of
berkley
manor
stood
there
sunday
found
the
rural
folk
and
some
esteemed
of
gentle
blood
in
vain
their
feet
with
loitering
tread
passed
the
graves
where
rank
is
naught
all
could
not
read
the
lesson
taught
in
that
republic
of
the
dead
the
pastor
rose
the
prayer
was
strong
the
psalm
was
warrior
david
song
the
text
a
few
short
words
of
might
the
lord
of
hosts
shall
arm
the
right
he
spoke
of
wrongs
too
long
endured
of
sacred
rights
to
be
secured
then
from
his
patriot
tongue
of
flame
the
startling
words
for
freedom
came
the
stirring
sentences
he
spake
compelled
the
heart
to
glow
or
quake
and
rising
on
his
theme
broad
wing
and
grasping
in
his
nervous
hand
the
imaginary
battle
brand
in
face
of
death
he
dared
to
fling
defiance
to
a
tyrant
king
even
as
he
spoke
his
frame
renewed
in
eloquence
of
attitude
rose
as
it
seemed
a
shoulder
higher
then
swept
his
kindling
glance
of
fire
from
startled
pew
to
breathless
choir
when
suddenly
his
mantle
wide
his
hands
impatient
flung
aside
and
lo
he
met
their
wondering
eyes
complete
in
all
a
warrior
guise
a
moment
there
was
awful
pause
when
berkley
cried
cease

the
house
of

the
other
shouted
nay
not
so
when
god
is
with
our
righteous
cause
his
holiest
places
then
are
ours
his
temples
are
our
forts
and
towers
that
frown
upon
the
tyrant
foe
in
this
the
dawn
of
freedom
day
there
is
a
time
to
fight
and
pray
and
now
before
the
open
door
the
warrior
priest
had
ordered
so
the
enlisting
trumpet
sudden
soar
rang
through
the
chapel
and
its
long
reverberating
blow
so
loud
and
clear
it
seemed
the
ear
of
dusty
death
must
wake
and
hear
and
there
the
startling
drum
and
fife
fired
the
living
with
fiercer
life
while
overhead
with
wild
increase
forgetting
its
ancient
toll
of
peace
the
great
bell
swung
as
before
it
seemed
as
it
would
never
cease
and
every
word
its
ardor
flung
from
off
its
jubilant
iron
tongue
was

no
one
has
a
temper
naturally
so
good
that
it
does
not
need
attention
and
cultivation
and
no
one
has
a
temper
so
bad
but
that
by
proper
culture
it
may
become
pleasant
one
of
the
best
disciplined
tempers
ever
seen
was
that
of
a
gentleman
who
was
naturally
quick
irritable
rash
and
violent
but
by
having
the
care
of
the
sick
and
especially
of
deranged
people
he
so
completely
mastered
himself
that
he
was
never
known
to
be
thrown
off
his
guard
the
difference
in
the
happiness
which
is
received
or
bestowed
by
the
man
who
governs
his
temper
and
that
by
the
man
who
does
not
is
immense
there
is
no
misery
so
constant
so
distressing
and
so
intolerable
to
others
as
that
of
having
a
disposition
which
is
your
master
and
which
is
continually
fretting
itself
there
are
corners
enough
at
every
turn
in
life
against
which
we
may
run
and
at
which
we
may
break
out
in
impatience
if
we
choose
look
at
roger
sherman
who
rose
from
a
humble
occupation
to
a
seat
in
the
first
congress
of
the
united
states
and
whose
judgment
was
received
with
great
deference
by
that
body
of
distinguished
men
he
made
himself
master
of
his
temper
and
cultivated
it
as
a
great
business
in
life
there
are
one
or
two
instances
which
show
this
part
of
his
character
in
a
light
that
is
beautiful
one
day
after
having
received
his
highest
honors
he
was
sitting
and
reading
in
his
parlor
a
roguish
student
in
a
room
close
by
held
a
in
such
a
position
as
to
pour
the
reflected
rays
of
the
sun
directly
in
sherman
face
he
moved
his
chair
and
the
thing
was
repeated
a
third
time
the
chair
was
moved
but
the
still
reflected
the
sun
in
his
eyes
he
laid
aside
his
book
went
to
the
window
and
many
witnesses
of
the
impudence
expected
to
hear
the
ungentlemanly
student
severely
reprimanded
he
raised
the
window
gently
and
then
shut
the
window
blind
i
can
not
forbear
adducing
another
instance
of
the
power
he
had
acquired
over
himself
he
was
naturally
possessed
of
strong
passions
but
over
these
he
at
length
obtained
an
extraordinary
control
he
became
habitually
calm
sedate
and
sherman
was
one
of
those
men
who
are
not
ashamed
to
maintain
the
forms
of
religion
in
their
families
one
morning
he
called
them
all
together
as
usual
to
lead
them
in
prayer
to
god
the
old
family
bible
was
brought
out
and
laid
on
the
table
sherman
took
his
seat
and
placed
beside
him
one
of
his
children
a
child
of
his
old
age
the
rest
of
the
family
were
seated
around
the
room
several
of
these
were
now
grown
up
besides
these
some
of
the
tutors
of
the
college
were
boarders
in
the
family
and
were
present
at
the
time
alluded
to
his
aged
and
superannuated
mother
occupied
a
corner
of
the
room
opposite
the
place
where
the
distinguished
judge
sat
at
length
he
opened
the
bible
and
began
to
read
the
child
who
was
seated
beside
him
made
some
little
disturbance
upon
which
sherman
paused
and
told
it
to
be
still
again
he
proceeded
but
again
he
paused
to
reprimand
the
little
offender
whose
playful
disposition
would
scarcely
permit
it
to
be
still
and
this
time
he
gently
tapped
its
ear
the
blow
if
blow
it
might
be
called
caught
the
attention
of
his
aged
mother
who
now
with
some
effort
rose
from
the
seat
and
tottered
across
the
room
at
length
she
reached
the
chair
of
sherman
and
in
a
moment
most
unexpectedly
to
him
she
gave
him
a
blow
on
the
ear
with
all
the
force
she
could
summon
there
said
she
you
strike
your
child
and
i
will
strike
mine
for
a
moment
the
blood
was
seen
mounting
to
the
face
of
sherman
but
it
was
only
for
a
moment
when
all
was
calm
and
mild
as
usual
he
paused
he
raised
his
spectacles
he
cast
his
eye
upon
his
mother
again
it
fell
upon
the
book
from
which
he
had
been
reading
not
a
word
escaped
him
but
again
he
calmly
pursued
the
service
and
soon
after
sought
in
prayer
an
ability
to
set
an
example
before
his
household
which
would
be
worthy
of
their
imitation

a
victory

lxix
the
crazy
engineer
my
train
left
dantzic
in
the
morning
generally
about
eight
but
once
a
week
we
had
to
wait
for
the
arrival
of
the
steamer
from
stockholm
it
was
the
morning
of
the
steamer
arrival
that
i
came
down
from
the
hotel
and
found
that
my
engineer
had
been
so
seriously
injured
that
he
could
not
perform
his
work
i
went
immediately
to
the
engine
house
to
procure
another
engineer
for
i
supposed
there
were
three
or
four
in
reserve
there
but
i
was
disappointed
i
heard
the
puffing
of
the
steamer
and
the
passengers
would
be
on
hand
in
fifteen
minutes
i
ran
to
the
guards
and
asked
them
if
they
knew
where
there
was
an
engineer
but
they
did
not
i
then
went
to
the
firemen
and
asked
them
if
anyone
of
them
felt
competent
to
run
the
engine
to
bromberg
no
one
dared
to
attempt
it
the
distance
was
nearly
one
hundred
miles
what
was
to
be
done
the
steamer
stopped
at
the
wharf
and
those
who
were
going
on
by
rail
came
flocking
to
the
station
they
had
eaten
breakfast
on
board
the
boat
and
were
all
ready
for
a
fresh
start
the
train
was
in
readiness
in
the
long
station
house
and
the
engine
was
steaming
and
puffing
away
impatiently
in
the
distant
firing
house
it
was
past
nine
come
why
do
we
start
growled
an
old
fat
swede
who
had
been
watching
me
narrowly
for
the
last
fifteen
minutes
and
upon
this
there
was
a
general
chorus
of
anxious
inquiry
which
soon
settled
to
downright
murmuring
at
this
juncture
some
one
touched
me
on
the
elbow
i
turned
and
saw
a
stranger
by
my
side
i
thought
that
he
was
going
to
remonstrate
with
me
for
my
backwardness
in
fact
i
began
to
have
strong
temptations
to
pull
off
my
uniform
for
every
anxious
eye
was
fixed
upon
the
glaring
badges
which
marked
me
as
the
chief
officer
of
the
train
however
this
stranger
was
a
man
tall
and
stout
with
a
face
of
great
energy
and
intelligence
his
eye
was
black
and
brilliant
so
brilliant
that
i
could
not
gaze
steadily
into
it
though
i
tried
and
his
lips
which
were
very
thin
seemed
more
like
polished
marble
than
human
flesh
his
dress
was
black
throughout
and
not
only
set
with
exact
nicety
but
was
scrupulously
clean
and
neat
you
want
an
engineer
i
understand
he
said
in
a
low
cautious
tone
at
the
same
time
gazing
quietly
about
him
as
though
he
wanted
no
one
to
hear
what
he
said
i
do
i
replied
my
train
is
all
ready
and
we
have
no
engineer
within
twenty
miles
of
this
place
well
sir
i
am
going
to
bromberg
i
must
go
and
i
will
run
the
engine
for
you
ha
i
uttered
are
you
an
engineer
i
am
sir
one
of
the
oldest
in
the
country
and
am
now
on
my
way
to
make
arrangements
for
a
great
improvement
i
have
invented
for
the
application
of
steam
to
a
locomotive
my
name
is
martin
kroller
if
you
wish
i
will
run
as
far
as
bromberg
and
i
will
show
you
running
that
is
running
was
i
not
fortunate
i
determined
to
accept
the
man
offer
at
once
and
so
i
told
him
he
received
my
answer
with
a
nod
and
a
smile
i
went
with
him
to
the
house
where
we
found
the
engine
in
charge
of
the
fireman
and
all
ready
for
a
start
kroller
got
upon
the
platform
and
i
followed
him
i
had
never
seen
a
man
betray
such
a
peculiar
aptness
amid
machinery
as
he
did
he
let
on
the
steam
in
an
instant
but
yet
with
care
and
judgment
and
he
backed
up
to
the
baggage
carriage
with
the
most
exact
nicety
i
had
seen
enough
to
assure
me
that
he
was
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
business
and
i
felt
composed
once
more
i
gave
my
engine
up
to
the
new
man
and
then
hastened
away
to
the
office
word
was
passed
for
all
the
passengers
to
take
their
seats
and
soon
afterward
i
waved
my
hand
to
the
engineer
there
was
a
puff
a
groaning
of
the
heavy
axletrees
a
trembling
of
the
building
and
the
train
was
in
motion
i
leaped
upon
the
platform
of
the
guard
carriage
and
in
a
few
minutes
more
the
station
house
was
far
behind
us
in
less
than
an
hour
we
reached
dirschau
where
we
took
up
the
passengers
that
had
come
on
the
konigsberg
railway
here
i
went
forward
and
asked
kroller
how
he
liked
the
engine
he
replied
that
he
liked
it
very
much
but
he
added
with
a
strange
sparkling
of
the
eye
wait
until
i
get
my
improvement
and
then
you
will
see
traveling
why
i
could
run
an
engine
of
my
construction
to
the
moon
in
four
and
twenty
hours
i
smiled
at
what
i
thought
his
enthusiasm
and
then
went
back
to
my
station
as
soon
as
the
konigsberg
passengers
were
all
on
board
and
their
baggage
carriage
attached
we
started
on
again
soon
after
i
went
into
the
guard
carriage
and
sat
down
an
early
train
from
konigsberg
had
been
through
two
hours
before
and
was
awaiting
us
at
little
oscue
where
we
took
on
board
the
western
mail
how
we
go
uttered
one
of
the
guards
some
fifteen
minutes
after
we
had
left
dirschau
the
new
engineer
is
trying
the
speed
i
replied
not
yet
having
any
fear
but
ere
long
i
began
to
apprehend
he
was
running
a
little
too
fast
the
carriages
began
to
sway
to
and
fro
and
i
could
hear
exclamations
of
fright
from
the
passengers
good
heavens
cried
one
of
the
guards
coming
in
at
that
moment
what
is
that
fellow
doing
look
sir
and
see
how
we
are
going
i
looked
at
the
window
and
found
that
we
were
dashing
along
at
a
speed
never
before
traveled
on
that
road
posts
fences
rocks
and
trees
flew
by
in
one
undistinguished
mass
and
the
carriages
now
swayed
fearfully
i
started
to
my
feet
and
met
a
passenger
on
the
platform
he
was
one
of
the
chief
owners
of
our
road
and
was
just
on
his
way
to
berlin
he
was
pale
and
excited
sir
he
gasped
is
martin
kroller
on
the
engine
yes
i
told
him
what
did
you
know
him
know
i
repeated
somewhat
puzzled
what
do
you
mean
he
told
me
his
name
was
kroller
and
that
he
was
an
engineer
we
had
no
one
to
run
the
engine
and
you
took
him
interrupted
the
man
good
heavens
sir
he
is
as
crazy
as
a
man
can
be
he
turned
his
brain
over
a
new
plan
for
applying
steam
power
i
saw
him
at
the
station
but
did
not
fully
recognize
him
as
i
was
in
a
hurry
just
now
one
of
your
passengers
told
me
that
your
engineers
were
all
gone
this
morning
and
that
you
found
one
that
was
a
stranger
to
you
then
i
knew
the
man
whom
i
had
seen
was
martin
kroller
he
had
escaped
from
the
hospital
at
stettin
you
must
get
him
off
somehow
the
whole
fearful
truth
was
now
open
to
me
the
speed
of
the
train
was
increasing
every
moment
and
i
knew
that
a
few
more
miles
per
hour
would
launch
us
all
into
destruction
i
called
to
the
guard
and
then
made
my
way
forward
as
quickly
as
possible
i
reached
the
back
platform
of
the
tender
and
there
stood
kroller
upon
the
engine
board
his
hat
and
coat
off
his
long
black
hair
floating
wildly
in
the
wind
his
shirt
unbuttoned
at
the
front
his
sleeves
rolled
up
with
a
pistol
in
his
teeth
and
thus
glaring
upon
the
fireman
who
lay
motionless
upon
the
fuel
the
furnace
was
stuffed
till
the
very
latch
of
the
door
was
and
the
whole
engine
was
quivering
and
swaying
as
though
it
would
shiver
to
pieces
kroller
kroller
i
cried
at
the
top
of
my
voice
the
crazy
engineer
started
and
caught
the
pistol
in
his
hand
oh
how
those
great
black
eyes
glared
and
how
ghastly
and
frightful
the
face
looked
ha
ha
ha
he
yelled
demoniacally
glaring
upon
me
like
a
roused
lion
they
said
that
i
could
not
make
it
but
see
see
see
my
new
power
see
my
new
engine
i
made
it
and
they
are
jealous
of
me
i
made
it
and
when
it
was
done
they
stole
it
from
me
but
i
have
found
it
for
years
i
have
been
wandering
in
search
of
my
great
engine
and
they
said
it
was
not
made
but
i
have
found
it
i
knew
it
this
morning
when
i
saw
it
at
dantzic
and
i
was
determined
to
have
it
and
i
got
it
ho
ho
ho
we
on
the
way
to
the
moon
i
say
we
be
in
the
moon
in
four
and
twenty
hours
down
down
villain
if
you
move
i
shoot
you
this
was
spoken
to
the
poor
fireman
who
at
that
moment
attempted
to
rise
and
the
frightened
man
sank
back
again
here
little
oscue
just
before
us
cried
out
one
of
the
guard
but
even
as
he
spoke
the
buildings
were
at
hand
a
sickening
sensation
settled
upon
my
heart
for
i
supposed
that
we
were
now
gone
the
houses
flew
by
like
lightning
i
knew
if
the
officers
here
had
turned
the
switch
as
usual
we
should
be
hurled
into
eternity
in
one
fearful
crash
i
saw
a
flash
it
was
another
engine
i
closed
my
eyes
but
still
we
thundered
on
the
officers
had
seen
our
speed
and
knowing
that
we
would
not
be
able
to
stop
in
that
distance
they
had
changed
the
switch
so
that
we
went
forward
but
there
was
sure
death
ahead
if
we
did
not
stop
only
fifteen
miles
from
us
was
the
town
of
schwetz
on
the
vistula
and
at
the
rate
we
were
going
we
should
be
there
in
a
few
minutes
for
each
minute
carried
us
over
a
mile
the
shrieks
of
the
passengers
now
rose
above
the
crash
of
the
rails
and
more
terrific
than
all
else
arose
the
demoniac
yells
of
the
mad
engineer
merciful
heavens
gasped
the
guardsman
there
not
a
moment
to
lose
schwetz
is
close
but
hold
he
added
let
shoot
him
at
that
moment
a
tall
stout
german
student
came
over
the
platform
where
we
stood
and
saw
that
the
had
his
heavy
pistol
aimed
at
us
he
grasped
a
huge
stick
of
wood
and
with
a
steadiness
of
nerve
which
i
could
not
have
commanded
he
hurled
it
with
such
force
and
precision
that
he
knocked
the
pistol
from
the
maniac
hand
i
saw
the
movement
and
on
the
instant
that
the
pistol
fell
i
sprang
forward
and
the
german
followed
me
i
grasped
the
man
by
the
arm
but
i
should
have
been
nothing
in
his
mad
power
had
i
been
alone
he
would
have
hurled
me
from
the
platform
had
not
the
student
at
that
moment
struck
him
upon
the
head
with
a
stick
of
wood
which
he
caught
as
he
came
over
the
tender
kroller
settled
down
like
a
dead
man
and
on
the
next
instant
i
shut
off
the
steam
and
opened
the
valve
as
the
free
steam
shrieked
and
howled
in
its
escape
the
speed
began
to
decrease
and
in
a
few
minutes
more
the
danger
was
passed
as
i
settled
back
entirely
overcome
by
the
wild
emotions
that
had
raged
within
me
we
began
to
turn
the
river
and
before
i
was
fairly
recovered
the
fireman
had
stopped
the
train
in
the
station
house
at
schwetz
martin
kroller
still
insensible
was
taken
from
the
platform
and
as
we
carried
him
to
the
guard
room
one
of
the
guard
recognized
him
and
told
us
that
he
had
been
there
about
two
weeks
before
he
came
said
the
guard
and
swore
that
an
engine
which
stood
near
by
was
his
he
said
it
was
one
he
had
made
to
go
to
the
moon
in
and
that
it
had
been
stolen
from
him
we
sent
for
more
help
to
arrest
him
and
he
fled
well
i
replied
with
a
shudder
i
wish
he
had
approached
me
in
the
same
way
but
he
was
more
cautious
at
dantzic
at
schwartz
we
found
an
engineer
to
run
the
engine
to
bromberg
and
having
taken
out
the
western
mail
for
the
next
northern
mail
to
carry
along
we
saw
that
kroller
would
be
properly
attended
to
and
then
started
on
the
rest
of
the
trip
we
ran
in
safety
though
i
could
see
the
passengers
were
not
wholly
at
ease
and
would
not
be
until
they
were
entirely
clear
of
the
railway
martin
kroller
remained
insensible
from
the
effects
of
the
blow
nearly
two
weeks
and
when
he
recovered
from
that
he
was
sound
again
his
insanity
was
all
gone
i
saw
him
about
three
weeks
afterward
but
he
had
no
recollection
of
me
he
remembered
nothing
of
the
past
year
not
even
his
mad
freak
on
my
engine
but
i
remembered
it
and
i
remember
it
still
and
the
people
need
never
fear
that
i
shall
be
imposed
upon
again
by
a
crazy
engineer

to

soon
removed
with
his

to

where
he
lived
until
twenty
years
of
age
on
a
farm
his
means
of
schooling
were
most
limited
but
he
was
very
ambitious
and
seized
every
opportunity
by
his
own
efforts
he
earned
enough
money
to
carry
him
through
middlebury
college
where
he
graduated
in
he
then
went
to
virginia
as
private
tutor
and
while
there
was

shortly
returned

have
you
any
questions
to
ask
me
in
the
other
branches
sir
asked
locke
not
many
replied
bunker
there
is
reading
writing
grammar
which
i
know
nothing
about
and
as
to
them
i
must
of
course
take
you
by
guess
which
will
not
be
much
of
a
guess
after
all
if
i
find
you
have
thought
well
on
all
other
matters
do
you
understand
philosophy
to
what
branch
of
philosophy
do
you
allude
sir
to
the
only
branch
there
is
but
you
are
aware
that
philosophy
is
divided
into
different
kinds
as
natural
moral
and
intellectual
nonsense
philosophy
is
philosophy
and
means
the
study
of
the
reasons
and
causes
of
the
things
which
we
see
whether
it
be
applied
to
a
crazy
man
dreams
or
the
roasting
of
potatoes
have
you
attended
to
it
yes
to
a
considerable
extent
sir
i
will
put
a
question
or
two
then
if
you
please
what
is
the
reason
of
the
fact
for
it
is
a
fact
that
the
damp
breath
of
a
person
blown
on
a
good
knife
and
on
a
bad
one
will
soonest
disappear
from
the
blade
it
may
be
owing
to
the
difference
in
the
polish
of
the
two
blades
perhaps
replied
locke
ah
that
is
an
answer
that
do
go
deeper
than
the
surface
rejoined
bunker
humorously
as
good
a
thinker
as
you
evidently
are
you
have
not
thought
on
this
subject
i
suspect
it
took
me
a
week
in
all
i
presume
of
hard
thinking
and
making
experiments
at
a
blacksmith
shop
to
discover
the
reason
of
this
it
is
not
the
polish
for
take
two
blades
of
equal
polish
and
the
breath
will
disappear
from
one
as
much
quicker
than
it
does
from
the
other
as
the
blade
is
better
it
is
because
the
material
of
the
blade
is
more
compact
or
less
porous
in
one
case
than
in
the
other
in
the
first
place
i
ascertained
that
the
steel
was
made
more
compact
by
being
hammered
and
tempered
and
that
the
better
it
was
tempered
the
more
compact
it
would
become
the
size
of
the
pores
being
made
of
course
less
in
the
same
proportion
well
then
i
saw
the
reason
i
was
in
search
of
at
once
for
we
know
a
wet
sponge
is
longer
in
drying
than
a
wet
piece
of
green
wood
because
the
pores
of
the
first
are
bigger
a
seasoned
or
shrunk
piece
of
wood
dries
quicker
than
a
green
one
for
the
same
reason
or
you
might
bore
a
piece
of
wood
with
large
gimlet
holes
and
another
with
small
ones
fill
them
both
with
water
and
let
them
stand
till
the
water
evaporated
and
the
difference
of
time
it
would
take
to
do
this
would
make
the
case
still
more
plain
so
with
the
blades
the
vapor
lingers
longest
on
the
worst
wrought
and
tempered
one
because
the
pores
being
larger
take
in
more
of
the
wet
particles
and
require
more
time
in
drying
your
theory
is
at
least
a
very
ingenious
one
observed
locke
and
i
am
reminded
by
it
of
another
of
the
natural
phenomena
of
the
true
explanation
of
which
i
have
not
been
able
to
satisfy
myself
it
is
this
what
makes
the
earth
freeze
harder
and
deeper
under
a
trodden
path
than
the
untrodden
earth
around
it
all
that
i
have
asked
say
it
is
because
the
trodden
earth
is
more
compact
but
is
that
reason
a
sufficient
one
no
said
bunker
but
i
will
tell
you
what
the
reason
is
for
i
thought
that
out
long
ago
you
know
that
in
the
freezing
months
much
of
the
warmth
we
get
is
given
out
by
the
earth
from
which
at
intervals
if
not
constantly
to
some
extent
ascend
the
warm
vapors
to
mingle
with
and
moderate
the
cold
atmosphere
above
now
these
ascending
streams
of
warm
air
would
be
almost
wholly
obstructed
by
the
compactness
of
a
trodden
path
and
they
would
naturally
divide
at
some
distance
below
it
and
pass
up
through
the
loose
earth
on
each
side
leaving
the
ground
along
the
line
of
the
path
to
a
great
depth
beneath
it
a
cold
dead
mass
through
which
the
frost
would
continue
to
penetrate
unchecked
by
the
internal
heat
which
in
its
unobstructed
ascent
on
each
side
would
be
continually
checking
or
overcoming
the
frost
in
its
action
on
the
earth
around
that
sir
is
the
true
philosophy
of
the
case
you
may
depend
upon
it
but
we
will
now
drop
the
discussion
of
these
matters
for
i
am
abundantly
satisfied
that
you
have
not
only
knowledge
enough
but
that
you
can
think
for
yourself
and
now
sir
all
i
wish
to
know
further
about
you
is
whether
you
can
teach
others
to
think
which
is
half
the
battle
with
a
teacher
but
as
i
have
had
an
eye
on
this
point
while
attending
to
the
others
probably
one
experiment
which
i
will
ask
you
to
make
on
one
of
the
boys
here
will
be
all
i
shall
want
proceed
sir
said
the
other
ay
sir
rejoined
bunker
turning
to
the
open
fireplace
in
which
the
burning
wood
was
sending
up
a
column
of
smoke
there
you
see
that
smoke
rising
do
you
well
you
and
i
know
the
reason
why
smoke
goes
upward
but
my
youngest
boy
does
not
i
think
now
take
your
own
way
and
see
if
you
can
make
him
understand
it
locke
after
a
moment
reflection
and
a
glance
round
the
room
for
something
to
serve
for
apparatus
took
from
a
shelf
where
he
had
espied
a
number
of
articles
the
smallest
of
a
set
of
cart
boxes
as
are
usually
termed
the
round
hollow
tubes
in
which
the
axletree
of
a
carriage
turns
then
selecting
a
tin
cup
that
would
just
take
in
the
box
and
turning
into
the
cup
as
much
water
as
he
judged
with
the
box
would
fill
it
he
presented
them
separately
to
the
boy
and
said
there
my
lad
tell
me
which
of
these
is
the
heavier
why
the
cart
box
to
be
sure
replied
the
boy
taking
the
cup
with
water
in
one
hand
and
the
hollow
iron
in
the
other
then
you
think
this
iron
is
heavier
than
as
much
water
as
would
fill
the
place
of
it
do
you
resumed
locke
why
yes
as
heavy
again
and
more
too
i
know
it
is
promptly
said
the
boy
well
sir
now
mark
what
i
do
proceeded
the
former
dropping
into
the
cup
the
iron
box
through
the
hollow
of
which
the
water
instantly
rose
to
the
brim
of
the
vessel
there
you
saw
that
water
rise
to
the
top
of
the
cup
did
you
yes
i
did
very
well
what
caused
it
to
do
so
why
i
know
well
enough
if
i
could
only
think
why
it
is
because
the
iron
is
the
heavier
and
as
it
comes
all
around
the
water
so
it
get
away
sideways
it
is
forced
up
that
is
right
and
now
i
want
you
to
tell
what
makes
that
smoke
rise
up
the
chimney
why
i
guess
replied
the
boy
hesitating
i
guess
i
guess
i
do
know
did
you
ever
get
up
in
a
chair
to
look
on
some
high
shelf
so
that
your
head
was
brought
near
the
ceiling
of
a
heated
room
in
winter
and
did
you
notice
any
difference
between
the
air
up
there
and
the
air
near
the
floor
yes
i
remember
i
have
and
found
the
air
up
there
as
warm
as
mustard
and
when
i
got
down
and
bent
my
head
near
the
floor
to
pick
up
something
i
found
it
as
cold
as
could
be
that
is
ever
the
case
but
i
wish
you
to
tell
me
how
the
cold
air
always
happens
to
settle
down
to
the
lower
part
of
the
room
while
the
warm
air
somehow
at
the
same
time
gets
above
why
why
heavy
things
settle
down
and
the
cold
air
yes
yes
that
it
i
am
sure
the
cold
air
is
heavier
and
so
settles
down
and
crowds
up
the
warm
air
very
good
you
then
understand
that
cold
air
is
heavier
than
the
heated
air
as
that
iron
is
heavier

the
water
so
now
we
will
go
back
to
the
main
question
what
makes
the
smoke
go
upwards
oh
i
see
now
as
plain
as
day
the
cold
air
settles
down
all
round
like
the
iron
box
and
drives
up
the
hot
air
as
fast
as
the
fire
heats
it
in
the
middle
like
the
water
and
so
the
hot
air
carries
the
smoke
along
up
with
it
just
as
feathers
and
things
in
a
whirlwind
well
i
have
found
out
what
makes
smoke
go
up
is
it
curious
done
like
a
philosopher
cried

the
thing
is
settled

grant
that
you

not

the

it
runs
through
the
realm

faultless
rhythm

sublime

how
the
winters
are
drifting
like
flakes

the
summers
like

a

the

of

are
playing

a
cloudless

a
tropical
clime

there
there

there
are
heaps

but
we
love
them
so
there
are
trinkets
and
tresses
of
hair
there
are
fragments
of
song
that
nobody
sings
and
a
part
of
an
infant
prayer
there
a
lute
unswept
and
a
harp
without
strings
there
are
broken
vows
and
pieces
of
rings
and
the
garments
that
she
used
to
wear
there
are
hands
that
are
waved
when
the
fairy
shore
by
the
mirage
is
lifted
in

and
we
sometimes
hear
through
the
turbulent
roar
sweet
voices
we
heard

gone

down

by

parties
of
soldiers
were
driving
about
the
streets
making
a
parade
of
valor
challenging
resistance
and
striking
the
inhabitants
indiscriminately
with
sticks
or
sheathed
cutlasses
a
band
which
poured
out
from
murray
barracks
in
brattle
street
armed
with
clubs
cutlasses
and

provoked

ensued

through

one
soldier
after

leveled
a

and
threatened
to
make
a
lane
through
the
crowd
just
before
nine
as
an
officer
crossed
king
street
now
state
street
a
barber
lad
cried
after
him
there
goes
a
mean
fellow
who
hath
not
paid
my
father
for
dressing
his
hair
on
which
the
sentinel
stationed
at
the
westerly
end
of
the
customhouse
on
the
corner
of
king
street
and
exchange
lane
left
his
post
and
with
his
musket
gave
the
boy
a
stroke
on
the
head
that
made
him
stagger
and
cry
for
pain
the
street
soon
became
clear
and
nobody
troubled
the
sentry
when
a
party
of
soldiers
issued
violently
from
the
main
guard
their
arms
glittering
in
the
moonlight
and
passed
on
hallooing
where
are
they
where
are
they
let
them
come
presently
twelve
or
fifteen
more
uttering
the
same
cries
rushed
from
the
south
into
king
street
and
so
by
the
way
of
cornhill
towards
barracks
pray
soldiers

my
life
cried
a
boy
of
twelve
whom
they
met
no

i
kill

all
answered
one
of
them
and
knocked
him
down
with
his
cutlass
they
abused
and
insulted
several
persons
at
their
doors
and
others
in
the
street
running
about
like
madmen
in
a
fury
crying
fire
which
seemed
their
watchword
and
where
are
they
knock
them
down
their
outrageous
behavior
occasioned
the
ringing
of
the
bell
at
the
head
of
king
street
the
citizens
whom
the
alarm
set
in
motion
came
out
with
canes
and
clubs
and
partly
by
the
interference
of
officers
partly
by
the
courage
of
crispus
attucks
a
mulatto
and
some
others
the

at

was
not
molested
the
whole
evening
a
body
of
soldiers
came
up
royal
exchange
lane
crying
where
are
the
cowards
and
brandishing
their
arms
passed
through

street
from
ten
to
twenty

another
towards
the

loaded
and
primed
his
musket
the
lobster

the

shouted
the
boys
for
they
were
persuaded
he
could
not
do
it
without
leave
from
a
civil
officer
and
a
young
fellow
spoke
out
we
will
knock
him
down
for

while
they
whistled
through

fingers
and
huzzaed
stand
off
said
the
sentry
and
shouted
aloud

of

in

and
preston
following
with
bayonets
fixed
they
rushed
through
the
people
upon
the
trot
cursing
them
and
pushing
them
as
they
went
along
they
found
about
ten
persons
round
the
sentry
while
about
fifty
or
sixty
came
down
with
them
for
god
sake
said
knox
holding
preston
by
the
coat
take
your
men
back
again
if
they
fire
your
life
must
answer
for
the
consequences
i
know
what
i
am
about
said
he
hastily
and
much
agitated
none
pressed
on
them
or
provoked
them
till
they
began
loading
when
a
party
of
about
twelve
in
number
with
sticks
in
their
hands
moved
from
the
middle
of
the
street
where
they
had
been
standing
gave
three
cheers
and
passed
along
the
front
of
the
soldiers
whose
muskets
some
of
them
struck
as
they
went
by
you
are
cowardly
rascals
they
said
for
bringing
arms
against
naked
men
lay
aside
your
guns
and
we
are
ready
for

the
soldiers
loaded
inquired

and
ball
are
they
going

upon
the
inhabitants
asked
theodore

if
you
dare
we

then
montgomery
received
a
blow
from
a
stick
which
had
hit
his
musket
and
the
word
fire
being
given
by
preston
he
stepped
a
little
to
one
side
and
shot
attucks

at
the
time
was
quietly
leaning
on
a
long
stick

said
langford
the
watchman
to

him
full
in

yet
he
did
so
and
samuel

two
of

mortally
of
all
the

not
more
than
one

any
share
in
the
disturbance
so
infuriated
were
the
soldiers
that
when
the
men
returned
to
take
up
the
dead
they
prepared
to
fire
again
but
were
checked
by
preston
while
the
regiment
appeared

he
took
down
from

in

arming
himself
with
his
cane
led
the
way
across
a
yard
to
a
door
in
the
rear
of
the
house
there
said
the
schoolmaster
as
they
stepped
in
together
this
is
our
shop
nickleby
it
was
such
a
crowded
scene
and
there
were
so
many
objects
to
attract
attention
that
at
first
nicholas
stared
about
him
really
without
seeing
anything
at
all
by
degrees
however
the
place
resolved
itself
into
a
bare
and
dirty
room
with
a
couple
of
windows
whereof
a
tenth
part
might
be
of
glass
the
remainder
being
stopped
up
with
old
copy
books
and
paper
there
were
a
couple
of
long
old
rickety
desks
cut
and
notched
and
inked
and
damaged
in
every
possible
way
two
or
three
forms
a
detached
desk
for
squeers
and
another
for
his
assistant
the
ceiling
was
supported
like
that
of
a
barn
by
crossbeams
and
rafters
and
the
walls
were
so
stained
and
discolored
that
it
was
impossible
to
tell
whether
they
had
ever
been
touched
by
paint
or
whitewash
pale
and
haggard
faces
lank
and
bony
figures
children
with
the
countenances
of
old
men
deformities
with
irons
upon
their
limbs
boys
of
stunted
growth
and
others
whose
long
meager
legs
would
hardly
bear
their
stooping
bodies
all
crowded
on
the
view
together
there
were
little
faces
which
should
have
been
handsome
darkened
with
the
scowl
of
sullen
dogged
suffering
there
was
childhood
with
the
light
of
its
eye
quenched
its
beauty
gone
and
its
helplessness
alone
remaining
and
yet
this
scene
painful
as
it
was
had
its
grotesque
features
which
in
a
less
interested
observer
than
nicholas
might
have
provoked
a
smile
squeers
stood
at
one
of
the
desks
presiding
over
an
immense
basin
of
brimstone
and
treacle
of
which
delicious
compound
she
administered
a
large
installment
to
each
boy
in
succession
using
for
the
purpose
a
common
wooden
spoon
which
might
have
been
originally
manufactured
for
some
gigantic
top
and
which
widened
every
young
gentleman
mouth
considerably
they
being
all
obliged
under
heavy
corporeal
penalties
to
take
in
the
whole
bowl
at
a
gasp
now
said
squeers
giving
the
desk
a
great
rap
with
his
cane
which
made
half
the
little
boys
nearly
jump
out
of
their
boots
is
that
physicking
over
just
over
said
squeers
choking
the
last
boy
in
her
hurry
and
tapping
the
crown
of
his
head
with
the
wooden
spoon
to
restore
him
here
you
smike
take
away
now
look
sharp
smike
shuffled
out
with
the
basin
and
squeers
hurried
out
after
him
into
a
species
of
washhouse
where
there
was
a
small
fire
and
a
large
kettle
together
with
a
number
of
little
wooden
bowls
which
were
arranged
upon
a
board
into
these
bowls
squeers
assisted
by
the
hungry
servant
poured
a
brown
composition
which
looked
like
diluted
pincushions
without
the
covers
and
was
called
porridge
a
minute
wedge
of
brown
bread
was
inserted
in
each
bowl
and
when
they
had
eaten
their
porridge
by
means
of
the
bread
the
boys
ate
the
bread
itself
and
had
finished
their
breakfast
whereupon
squeers
went
away
to
his
own
after
some
delay
squeers
reappeared
and
the
boys
took
their
places
and
their
books
of
which
latter
commodity
the
average
might
be
about
one
to
eight
learners
a
few
minutes
having
elapsed
during
which
squeers
looked
very
profound
as
if
he
had
a
perfect
apprehension
of
what
was
inside
all
the
books
and
could
say
every
word
of
their
contents
by
heart
if
he
only
chose
to
take
the
trouble
that
gentleman
called
up
the
first
class
obedient
to
this
summons
there
ranged
themselves
in
front
of
the
schoolmaster
desk
half
a
dozen
scarecrows
out
at
knees
and
elbows
one
of
whom
placed
a
torn
and
filthy
book
beneath
his
learned
eye
this
is

capturing
the
wild
horse
we
left
the
buffalo
camp
about
eight
and
had
a
toilsome
and
harassing
march
of
two
hours
over
ridges
of
hills
covered
with
a
ragged
forest
of
scrub
oaks
and
broken
by
deep
gullies
about
ten
in
the
morning
we
came
to
where
this
line
of
rugged
hills
swept
down
into
a
valley
through
which
flowed
the
north
fork
of
red
river
a
beautiful
meadow
about
half
a
mile
wide
enameled
with
yellow
autumnal
flowers
stretched
for
two
or
three
miles
along
the
foot
of
the
hills
bordered
on
the
opposite
side
by
the
river
whose
banks
were
fringed
with
cottonwood
trees
the
bright
foliage
of
which
refreshed
and
delighted
the
eye
after
being
wearied
by
the
contemplation
of
monotonous
wastes
of
brown
forest
the
meadow
was
finely
diversified
by
groves
and
clumps
of
trees
so
happily
dispersed
that
they
seemed
as
if
set
out
by
the
hand
of
art
as
we
cast
our
eyes
over
this
fresh
and
delightful
valley
we
beheld
a
troop
of
wild
horses
quietly
grazing
on
a
green
lawn
about
a
mile
distant
to
our
right
while
to
our
left
at
nearly
the
same
distance
were
several
buffaloes
some
feeding
others
reposing
and
ruminating
among
the
high
rich
herbage
under
the
shade
of
a
clump
of
cottonwood
trees
the
whole
had
the
appearance
of
a
broad
beautiful
tract
of
pasture
land
on
the
highly
ornamented
estate
of
some
gentleman
farmer
with
his
cattle
grazing
about
the
lawns
and
meadows
a
council
of
war
was
now
held
and
it
was
determined
to
profit
by
the
present
favorable
opportunity
and
try
our
hand
at
the
grand
hunting
maneuver
which
is
called
ringing
the
wild
horse
this
requires
a
large
party
of
horsemen
well
mounted
they
extend
themselves
in
each
direction
at
a
certain
distance
apart
and
gradually
form
a
ring
of
two
or
three
miles
in
circumference
so
as
to
surround
the
game
this
must
be
done
with
extreme
care
for
the
wild
horse
is
the
most
readily
alarmed
inhabitant
of
the
prairie
and
can
scent
a
hunter
a
great
distance
if
to
windward
the
ring
being
formed
two
or
three
ride
toward
the
horses
which
start
off
in
an
opposite
direction
whenever
they
approach
the
bounds
of
the
ring
however
a
huntsman
presents
himself
and
turns
them
from
their
course
in
this
way
they
are
checked
and
driven
back
at
every
point
and
kept
galloping
round
and
round
this
magic
circle
until
being
completely
tired
down
it
is
easy
for
hunters
to
ride
up
beside
them
and
throw
the
lariat
over
their
heads
the
prime
horses
of
the
most
speed
courage
and
bottom
however
are
apt
to
break
through
and
escape
so
that
in
general
it
is
the
horses
that
are
taken
preparations
were
now
made
for
a
hunt
of
this
kind
the
pack
horses
were
now
taken
into
the
woods
and
firmly
tied
to
trees
lest
in
a
rush
of
the
wild
horses
they
should
break
away
men
were
then
sent
under
the
command
of
a
lieutenant
to
steal
along
the
edge
of
the
valley
within
the
strip
of
wood
that
skirted
the
hills
they
were
to
station
themselves
about
fifty
yards
apart
within
the
edge
of
the
woods
and
not
advance
or
show
themselves
until
the
horses
dashed
in
that
direction
men
were
sent
across
the
valley
to
steal
in
like
manner
along
the
river
bank
that
bordered
the
opposite
side
and
to
station
themselves
among
the
trees
a
third
party
of
about
the
same
number
was
to
form
a
line
stretching
across
the
lower
part
of
the
valley
so
as
to
connect
the
two
wings
beatte
and
our
other
antoine
together
with
the
tonish
were
to
make
a
circuit
through
the
woods
so
as
to
get
to
the
upper
part
of
the
valley
in
the
rear
of
the
horses
and
drive
them
forward
into
the
kind
of
sack
that
we
had
formed
while
the
two
wings
should
join
behind
them
and
make
a
complete
circle
the
flanking
parties
were
quietly
extending
themselves
out
of
sight
on
each
side
of
the
valley
and
the
residue
were
stretching
themselves
like
the
links
of
a
chain
across
it
when
the
wild
horses
gave
signs
that
they
scented
an
enemy
snuffing
the
air
snorting
and
looking
about
at
length
they
pranced
off
slowly
toward
the
river
and
disappeared
behind
a
green
bank
here
had
the
regulations
of
the
chase
been
observed
they
would
have
been
quietly
checked
and
turned
back
by
the
advance
of
a
hunter
from
among
the
trees
unluckily
however
we
had
our
wildfire
little
frenchman
to
deal
with
instead
of
keeping
quietly
up
the
right
side
of
the
valley
to
get
above
the
horses
the
moment
he
saw
them
move
toward
the
river
he
broke
out
of
the
covert
of
woods
and
dashed
furiously
across
the
plain
in
pursuit
of
them
this
put
an
end
to
all
system
the
and
half
a
score
of
rangers
joined
in
the
chase
a
way
they
all
went
over
the
green
bank
in
a
moment
or
two
the
wild
horses
reappeared
and
came
thundering
down
the
valley
with
frenchman
and
rangers
galloping
and
bellowing
behind
them
it
was
in
vain
that
the
line
drawn
across
the
valley
attempted
to
check
and
turn
back
the
fugitives
they
were
too
hotly
pressed
by
their
pursuers
in
their
panic
they
dashed
through
the
line
and
clattered
down
the
plain
the
whole
troop
joined
in
the
headlong
chase
some
of
the
rangers
without
hats
or
caps
their
hair
flying
about
their
ears
and
others
with
handkerchiefs
tied
round
their
heads
the
buffaloes
which
had
been
calmly
ruminating
among
the
herbage
heaved
up
their
huge
forms
gazed
for
a
moment
at
the
tempest
that
came
scouring
down
the
meadow
then
turned
and
took
to
heavy
rolling
flight
they
were
soon
overtaken
the
promiscuous
throng
were
pressed
together
by
the
contracting
sides
of
the
valley
and
away
they
went
pellmell
wild
buffalo
wild
horse
wild
huntsman
with
clang
and
clatter
and
whoop
and
halloo
that
made
the
forests
ring
at
length
the
buffaloes
turned
into
a
green
brake
on
the
river
bank
while
the
horses
dashed
up
a
narrow
defile
of
the
hills
with
their
pursuers
close
to
their
heels
beatte
passed
several
of
them
having
fixed
his
eye
upon
a
fine
pawnee
horse
that
had
his
ears
slit
and
saddle
marks
upon
his
back
he
pressed
him
gallantly
but
lost
him
in
the
woods
among
the
wild
horses
was
a
fine
black
mare
which
in
scrambling
up
the
defile
tripped
and
fell
a
young
ranger
sprang
from
his
horse
and
seized
her
by
the
mane
and
muzzle
another
ranger
dismounted
and
came
to
his
assistance
the
mare
struggled
fiercely
kicking
and
biting
and
striking
with
her
fore
feet
but
a
noose
was
slipped
over
her
head
and
her
struggles
were
in
vain
it
was
some
time
however
before
she
gave
over
rearing
and
plunging
and
lashing
out
with
her
feet
on
every
side
the
two
rangers
then
led
her
along
the
valley
by
two
strong
lariats
which
enabled
them
to
keep
at
a
sufficient
distance
on
each
side
to
be
out
of
the
reach
of
her
hoofs
and
whenever
she
struck
out
in
one
direction
she
was
jerked
in
the
other
in
this
way
her
spirit
was
gradually
subdued
as
to
tonish
who
had
marred
the
whole
scene
by
his
precipitancy
he
had
been
more
successful
than
he
deserved
having
managed
to
catch
a
beautiful
colt
about
seven
months
old
that
had
not
strength
to
keep
up
with
its
companions
the
mercurial

one
fine
morning
not

i

down
the
merrimac
on
the
tewksbury
shore
i
know
of
no
walk
in
the
vicinity
of
lowell
so
inviting
as
that
along
the
margin
of
the
river
for
nearly
a
mile
from
the
village
of
belvidere
the
path
winds
green
and
among
beeches
and
oaks
through
whose
boughs
you
catch
glimpses
of
waters
sparkling
and
dashing
below
rocks
huge
and
picturesque
jut
out
into
the
stream
affording
beautiful
views
of
the
river
and
the
distant
city
half
fatigued
with
my
walk
i
threw
myself
down
upon
a
rocky
slope
of
the
bank
where
the
panorama
of
earth
sky
and
water
lay
clear
and
distinct
about
me
far
above
silent
and
dim
as
a
picture
was
the
city
with
its
huge
mill
masonry
confused
chimney
tops
and
church
spires
near
it
rose
the
height
of
belvidere
with
its
deserted
burial
place
and
neglected
gravestones
sharply
defined
on
its
bleak
bare
summit
against
the
sky
before
me
the
river
went
dashing
down
its
rugged
channel
sending
up
its
everlasting
murmur
above
me
the
birch
tree
hung
its
tassels
and
the
last
wild
flowers
of
autumn
profusely
fringed
the
rocky
rim
of
the
water
right
opposite
the
dracut
woods
stretched
upwards
from
the
shore
beautiful
with
the
hues
of
frost
glowing
with
tints
richer
and
deeper
than
those
which
claude
or
poussin
mingled
as
if
the
rainbows
of
a
summer
shower
had
fallen
among
them
at
a
little
distance
to
the
right
a
group
of
cattle
stood
deep
in
the
river
and
a
troop
of
children
and
mirthful
were
casting
pebbles
at
them
from
a
projecting
shelf
of
rock
over
all
a
warm
but
softened
sunshine
melted
down
from
a
slumberous
autumnal
sky
my
reverie
was
disagreeably
broken
a
low
grunting
sound
half
bestial
half
human
attracted
my
attention
i
was
not
alone
close
beside
me
half
hidden
by
a
tuft
of
bushes
lay
a
human
being
stretched
out
at

rooted
into

a
little
boy
five

six
years
of
age
clean
and
healthful
with
his
fair
brown
locks
and

stood
on

down
upon

an
expression
of
childhood
simple
and
unaffected
pity
what

asked
the

at

what

the
prostrate
groveler
struggled
halfway
up
exhibiting
the
bloated
and
filthy
countenance
of
a
drunkard
he
made
two

three
efforts
to
get
upon
his
feet
lost
his
balance
and
tumbled
forward
upon
his
face
what
are
you
doing

inquired
the
boy
i
taking

muttered
with
his
mouth
in
the
dirt
taking
his
comfort
there
he
lay
squalid

loathsome

life
on
a
liner
one
of
his
best
stories
among
the
luxuries
which
the
captain
had
provided
for
himself
and
passengers
was
a
fine
green
turtle
which
was
not
likely
to
suffer
from
exposure
to
salt
water
so
it
was
reserved
until
all
the
pigs
and
sheep
and
poultry
had
been
eaten
a
few
days
before
we
arrived
it
was
determined
to
kill
the
turtle
and
have
a
feast
the
next
day
our
cabin
gentlemen
had
been
long
enough
deprived
of
fresh
meats
to
make
them
cast
lickerish
glances
towards
their
friend
and
there
was
a
great
smacking
of
lips
the
day
before
he
was
killed
as
i
walked
aft
occasionally
i
heard
them
congratulating
themselves
on
their
prospective
turtle
soup
and
forcemeat
balls
and
one
of
them
to
heighten
the
luxury
of
the
feast
ate
nothing
but
a
dry
biscuit
for
the
hours
preceding
that
he
might
be
prepared
to
devour
his
full
share
of
the
unctuous
compound
it
was
to
be
a
gala
day
with
them
and
though
it
was
not
champagne
day
that
falling
on
saturday
and
this
on
friday
they
agreed
to
have
champagne
a
day
in
advance
that
nothing
should
be
wanting
to
give
a
finish
to
their
turtle
it
happened
to
be
a
rougher
day
than
usual
when
the
turtle
was
cooked
but
they
had
become
too
well
used
to
the
motion
of
the
ship
to
mind
that
it
happened
to
be
my
turn
at
the
wheel
the
hour
before
dinner
and
i
had
the
tantalizing
misery
of
hearing
them
laughing
and
talking
about
their
turtle
while
i
was
hungry
from
want
of
dry
bread
and
salt
meat
i
had
resolutely
kept
my
thoughts
from
the
cabin
during
all
the
passage
but
once
and
now
i
found
my
ideas
clustering
round
a
tureen
of
turtle
in
spite
of
all
my
philosophy
confound
them
if
they
had
gone
out
of
my
hearing
with
their
exulting
smacks
i
should
not
have
envied
their
soup
but
their
hungry
glee
so
excited
my
imagination
that
i
could
see
nothing
through
the
glazing
of
the
binnacle
but
a
white
plate
with
a
slice
of
lemon
on
the
rim
a
loaf
of
delicate
bread
a
silver
spoon
a
napkin
two
or

and
a

clustering
round
it
and
a
stream
of

thick
and
fragrant
turtle
pouring
into
the
plate
by
and
by
it
was
four
bells
they
dined
at
three
and
all
the
gentlemen
with
the
captain
at
their
head
darted
below
into
the
cabin
where
their
mirth
increased
when
they
caught

of
the
soup

the

coming
sir
replied
the
steward
in
a
few
moments
the
cook
opened
the
door
of
his
galley
and
out
came
the
delicious
steam
of
the
turtle
then
came
the
steward
with
a
large
covered
tureen
in
his
hand
towards
the
cabin
gangway
i
forgot
the
ship
for
a
moment
in
looking
at
this
precious
cargo
the
wheel
slipped
from
my
hands
the
ship
broached
to
with
a
sudden
jerk
the
steward
had
got
only
one
foot
upon
the
stairs
when
this
unexpected
motion
threw
him
off
his
balance
and
down
he
went
by
the
run
the
tureen
slipped
from
his
hands
and
part
of
its
contents
flew
into
the
lee
scuppers
and
the
balance
followed
him
in
his
fall
i
laughed
outright
i
enjoyed
the
turtle
a
thousand
times
more
than
i
should
have
done
if
i
had
eaten
the
whole
of
it
but
i
was
forced
to
restrain
my
mirth
for
the
next
moment
the
steward
ran
upon
deck
followed
by
the
captain
in
a
furious
rage
threatening
if
he
caught
him
to
throw
him
overboard
not
a
spoonful
of
the
soup
had
been
left
in
the
coppers
for
the
steward
had
taken
it
all
away
at
once
to
keep
it
warm
in
about
an
hour
afterwards
the
passengers
came

the
best
kind
of
revenge
some
years
ago
a
warehouseman
in
manchester
england
published
a
scurrilous
pamphlet
in
which
he
endeavored
to
hold
up
the
house
of
grant
brothers
to
ridicule
william
grant
remarked
upon
the
occurrence
that
the
man
would
live
to
repent
of
what
he
had
done
and
this
was
conveyed
by
some
talebearer
to
the
libeler
who
said
oh
i
suppose
he
thinks
i
shall
some
time
or
other
be
in
his
debt
but
i
will
take
good
care
of
that
it
happens
however
that
a
man
in
business
can
not
always
choose
who
shall
be
his
creditors
the
pamphleteer
became
a
bankrupt
and
the
brothers
held
an
acceptance
of
his
which
had
been
indorsed
to
them
by
the
drawer
who
had
also
become
a
bankrupt
the
wantonly
libeled
men
had
thus
become
creditors
of
the
libeler
they
now
had
it
in
their
power
to
make
him
repent
of
his
audacity
he
could
not
obtain
his
certificate
without
their
signature
and
without
it
he
could
not
enter
into
business
again
he
had
obtained
the
number
of
signatures
required
by
the
bankrupt
law
except
one
it
seemed
folly
to
hope
that
the
firm
of
the
brothers
would
supply
the
deficiency
what
they
who
had
cruelly
been
made
the
laughingstock
of
the
public
forget
the
wrong
and
favor
the
wrongdoer
he
despaired
but
the
claims
of
a
wife
and
children
forced
him
at
last
to
make
the
application
humbled
by
misery
he
presented
himself
at
the
countinghouse

the

first
words
to
the
delinquent
were
shut

sir
sternly
uttered
the
door
was
shut
and
the
libeler
stood
trembling
before
the
libeled
he
told
his
tale
and
produced
his
certificate
which
was
instantly
clutched
by
the
injured
merchant
you
wrote
a
pamphlet
against
us
once
exclaimed
grant
the
suppliant
expected
to
see
his
parchment
thrown
into
the
fire
but
this
was
not
its
destination
grant
took
a
pen
and
writing
something
upon
the
document
handed
it
back
to
the
bankrupt
he
poor
wretch
expected
to
see
rogue
scoundrel
libeler
inscribed
but
there
was
in
fair
round
characters
the
signature
of
the
firm
we
make
it
a
rule
said
grant
never
to
refuse
signing
the
certificate
of
an
honest
tradesman
and
we
have
never
heard
that
you
were
anything
else
the
tears
started
into
the
poor
man
eyes
ah
said
grant
my
saying
was
true
i
said
you
would
live
to
repent
writing
that
pamphlet
i
did
not
mean
it
as
a
threat
i
only
meant
that
some
day
you
would
know
us
better
and
be
sorry
you
had
tried
to
injure
us
i
see
you
repent
of
it
now

bitterly
repent
it

my

now
how
do
you
get
on
what
are
you
going
to
do
the
poor
man
stated
he
had
friends
who
could
assist
him
when
his
certificate
was
obtained
but
how
are
you
off
in
the
meantime
and
the
answer
was
that
having
given
up
every
farthing
to
his
creditors
he
had
been
compelled
to
stint
his
family
of
even
common
necessaries
that
he
might
be
enabled
to
pay
the
cost
of
his
certificate
my

the

endeavored
in

to
express

thanks
the
swelling

he
put
his

to
his
face

went

we
fought
the
battle
bravely
and
when
the
day
was
done
full

a
corse
lay
ghastly

beneath

the
dead
and
dying
were

wound
on
their
gallant
breasts
the

of

were

that
thought
his

was
a
soldier

even
when
a
child
my
heart
leaped
forth
to
hear
him
tell
of
struggles
fierce
and
wild
and
when
he
died
and
left
us
to
divide
his
scanty
hoard

let
them
take
they
would

kept
my

with

it

again
with
glad
and
gallant
tread
but
to
look
upon
them
proudly
with
a
calm
and
steadfast
eye
for
her
brother
was
a
soldier
too
and
not

if
a

i
ask

do
you
keep
the

all
to
yourself
my
dear
bolingbroke
here
it
is
for
you
my
dear
i
have
finished

i
humbly
thank
you
for
giving
it
to
me
when
you
have
done
with
it
i
hate
stale

there
anything

i

nettleby
nettleby

but
why
did
you
tell
me
b
because
you
asked
me
my
dear
oh
but
it
is
a
hundred
times
pleasanter
to
read
the
paragraph
one
self
one
loses
all
the
pleasure
of
the
surprise
by
being
told
well
whose
was
the
other
marriage
oh
my
dear
i
will
not
tell

i
will
leave
you
the
pleasure
of
the
surprise
b
but
you
see
i
can
not
find
it
how
provoking
you
are
my
dear
do
pray
tell
me
b
our
friend
granby
granby
dear
why
did
you
not
make
me
guess
i
should
have
guessed
him
directly
but
why
do
you
call
him
our
friend
i
am
sure
he
is
no
friend
of
mine
nor
ever
was
i
took
an
aversion
to
him
as
you
remember
the
very
first
day
i
saw
him
i
am
sure
he
is
no
friend
of
mine
i
am
sorry
for
it
my
dear
but
i
hope
you
will
go
and
see
granby
b
not
i
indeed
my
dear
who
was
she
b
miss
cooke
cooke
but
there
are
so
many
cookes
ca
you
distinguish
her
any
way
has
she
no
christian
name
emma
i
think
yes
emma
emma
cooke
no
it
can
not
be
my
friend
emma
cooke
for
i
am
sure
she
was
cut
out
for
an
old
maid
b
this
lady
seems
to
me
to
be
cut
out
for
a
good
wife
b
maybe
so
i
am
sure
i
never
go
to
see
her
pray
my
dear
how
came
you
to
see
so
much
of
her
i
have
seen
very
little
of
her
my
dear
i
only
saw
her
two
or
three
times
before
she
was
married
b
then
my
dear
how
could
you
decide
that
she
was
cut
out
for
a
good
wife
i
am
sure
you
could
not
judge
of
her
by
seeing
her
only
two
or
three
times
and
before
she
was
married
b
indeed
my
love
that
is
a
very
just
observation
i
understand
that
compliment
perfectly
and
thank
you
for
it
my
dear
i
must
own
i
can
bear
anything
better
than
irony
b
irony
my
dear
i
was
perfectly
in
earnest
b
yes
yes
in
earnest
so
i
perceive
i
may
naturally
be
dull
of
apprehension
but
my
feelings
are
quick
enough
i
comprehend
too
well
yes
it
is
impossible
to
judge
of
a
woman
before
marriage
or
to
guess
what
sort
of
a
wife
she
will
make
i
presume
you
speak
from
experience
you
have
been
disappointed
yourself
and
repent
your
choice
b
my
dear
what
did
i
say
that
was
like
this
upon
my
word
i
meant
no
such
thing
i
really
was
not
thinking
of
you
in
the
least
b
no
you
never
think
of
me
now
i
can
easily
believe
that
you
were
not
thinking
of
me
in
the
least
b
but
i
said
that
only
to
prove
to
you
that
i
could
not
be
thinking
ill
of
you
my
dear
b
but
i
would
rather
that
you
thought
ill
of
me
than
that
you
should
not
think
of
me
at
all
b
well
my
dear
i
will
even
think
ill
of
you
if
that
will
please
you
b
do
you
laugh
at
me
when
it
comes
to
this
i
am
wretched
indeed
never
man
laughed
at
the
woman
he
loved
as
long
as
you
had
the
slightest
remains
of
love
for
me
you
could
not
make
me
an
object
of
derision
ridicule
and
love
are
incompatible
absolutely
incompatible
well
i
have
done
my
best
my
very
best
to
make
you
happy
but
in
vain
i
see
i
am
not
cut
out
to
be
a
good
wife
happy
happy
granby
b
happy
i
hope
sincerely
that
she
will
be
with
my
friend
but
my
happiness
must
depend
on
you
my
love
so
for
my
sake
if
not
for
your
own
be
composed
and
do
not
torment
yourself
with
such
fancies
i
do
wonder
whether
this
granby
is
really
that
miss
emma
cooke
i
go
and
see
her
directly
see
her
i
must
i
am
heartily
glad
of
it
my
dear
for
i
am
sure
a
visit
to
his
wife
will
give
my
friend
granby
real
pleasure
i
promise
you
my
dear
i
do
not
go
to
give
him
pleasure
or
you
either
but
to
satisfy
my
own
curiosity

to
convey

university
in
he
was
a
good
english
and
classical
scholar
and
was
well
acquainted
with
the
literature
of
the
east
his
father
was
a
maker
of
lead
pencils
and
he
followed
the
business
for
a
time
but
afterwards
supported
himself
mainly
by
teaching
lecturing
land
surveying
and
carpentering
in
he
built
himself
a
small
wooden
house
near
concord
on
the
shore
of
walden

where
he
lived
about
two

thoreau
has
few
if
any
superiors
in
all
the
pines
a
very
thin
membrane
in
appearance
much
like
an
insect
wing
grows
over
and
around
the
seed
and
independent
of
it
while
the
latter
is
being
developed
within
its
base
in
other
words
a
beautiful
thin
sack
is
woven
around
the
seed
with
a
handle
to
it
such
as
the
wind
can
take
hold
of
and
it
is
then
committed
to
the
wind
expressly
that
it
may
transport
the
seed
and
extend
the
range
of
the
species
and
this
it
does
as
effectually
as
when
seeds
are
sent
by
mail
in
a
different
kind
of
sack
from
the
patent
office
there
is
then
no
necessity
for
supposing
that
the
pines
have
sprung
up
from
nothing
and
i
am
aware
that
i
am
not
at
all
peculiar
in
asserting
that
they
come
from
seeds
though
the
mode
of
their
propagation
by
nature
has
been
but
little
attended
to
they
are
very
extensively
raised
from
the
seed
in
europe
and
are
beginning
to
be
here
when
you
cut
down
an
oak
wood
a
pine
wood
will
not
at
once
spring
up
there
unless
there
are
or
have
been
quite
recently
pines
near
enough
for
the
seeds
to
be
blown
from
them
but
adjacent
to
a
forest
of
pines
if
you
prevent
other
crops
from
growing
there
you
will
surely
have
an
extension
of
your
pine
forest
provided
the
soil
is
suitable
as
i
walk
amid
hickories
even
in
august
i
hear
the
sound
of
green
pignuts
falling
from
time
to
time
cut
off
by
the
chickaree
over
my
head
in
the
fall
i
notice
on
the
ground
either
within
or
in
the
neighborhood
of
oak
woods
on
all
sides
of
the
town
stout
oak
twigs
three
or
four
inches
long
bearing
half
a
dozen
empty
acorn
cups
which
twigs
have
been
gnawed
off
by
squirrels
on
both
sides
of
the
nuts
in
order
to
make
them
more
portable
the
jays
scream
and
the
red
squirrels
scold
while
you
are
clubbing
and
shaking
the
chestnut
trees
for
they
are
there
on
the
same
errand
and
two
of
a
trade
never
agree
i
frequently
see
a
red
or
a
gray
squirrel
cast
down
a
green
chestnut
burr
as
i
am
going
through
the
woods
and
i
used
to
think
sometimes
that
they
were
cast
at
me
in
fact
they
are
so
busy
about
it
in
the
midst
of
the
chestnut
season
that
you
can
not
stand
long
in
the
woods
without
hearing
one
fall
a
sportsman
told
me
that
he
had
the
day
before
that
was
in
the
middle
of
october
seen
a
green
chestnut
burr
dropped
on
our
great
river
meadow
fifty
rods
from
the
nearest
wood
and
much
farther
from
the
nearest
chestnut
tree
and
he
could
not
tell
how
it
came
there
occasionally
when
chestnutting
in
midwinter
i
find
thirty
or
forty
nuts
in
a
pile
left
in
its
gallery
just
under
the
leaves
by
the
common
wood
mouse
but
especially
in
the
winter
the
extent
to
which
this
transportation
and
planting
of
nuts
is
carried
on
is
made
apparent
by
the
snow
in
almost
every
wood
you
will
see
where
the
red
or
gray
squirrels
have
pawed
down
through
the
snow
in
a
hundred
places
sometimes
two
feet
deep
and
almost
always
directly
to
a
nut
or
a
pine
cone
as
directly
as
if
they
had
started
from
it
and
bored
upward
which
you
and
i
could
not
have
done
it
would
be
difficult
for
us
to
find
one
before
the
snow
falls
commonly
no
doubt
they
had
deposited
them
there
in
the
fall
you
wonder
if
they
remember
the
localities
or
discover
them
by
the
scent
the
red
squirrel
commonly
has
its
winter
abode
in
the
earth
under
a
thicket
of
evergreens
frequently
under
a
small
clump
of
evergreens
in
the
midst
of
a
deciduous
wood
if
there
are
any
nut
trees
which
still
retain
their
nuts
standing
at
a
distance
without
the
wood
their
paths
often
lead
directly
to
and
from
them
we
therefore
need
not
suppose
an
oak
standing
here
and
there
in
the
wood
in
order
to
seed
it
but
if
a
few
stand
within
twenty
or
thirty
rods
of
it
it
is
sufficient
i
think
that
i
may
venture
to
say
that
every
cone
that
falls
to
the
earth
naturally
in
this
town
before
opening
and
losing
its
seeds
and
almost
every
one
that
falls
at
all
is
cut
off
by
a
squirrel
and
they
begin
to
pluck
them
long
before
they
are
ripe
so
that
when
the
crop
of
cones
is
a
small
one
as
it
commonly
is
they
cut
off
thus
almost
everyone
of
these
before
it
fairly
ripens
i
think
moreover
that
their
design
if
i
may
so
speak
in
cutting
them
off
green
is
partly
to
prevent
their
opening
and
losing
their
seeds
for
these
are
the
ones
for
which
they
dig
through
the
snow
and
the
only
cones
which
contain
anything
then
i
have
counted
in
one
heap
the
cores
of
two
hundred
and
cones
which
had
been
cut
off
and
stripped
by
the
red
squirrel
the
previous
winter
the
nuts
thus
left
on
the
surface
or
buried
just
beneath
it
are
placed
in
the
most
favorable
circumstances
for
germinating
i
have
sometimes
wondered
how
those
which
merely
fell
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
got
planted
but
by
the
end
of
december
i
find
the
chestnut
of
the
same
year
partially
mixed
with
the
mold
as
it
were
under
the
decaying
and
moldy
leaves
where
there
is
all
the
moisture
and
manure
they
want
for
the
nuts
fall
fast
in
a
plentiful
year
a
large
proportion
of
the
nuts
are
thus
covered
loosely
an
inch
deep
and
are
of
course
somewhat
concealed
from
squirrels
one
winter
when
the
crop
had
been
abundant
i
got
with
the
aid
of
a
rake
many
quarts
of
these
nuts
as
late
as
the
tenth
of
january
and
though
some
bought
at
the
store
the
same
day
were
more
than
half
of
them
moldy
i
did
not
find
a
single
moldy
one
among
those
which
i
picked
from
under
the
wet
and
moldy
leaves
where
they
had
been
snowed
on
once
or
twice
nature
knew
how
to
pack
them
best
they
were
still
plump
and
tender
apparently
they
do
not
heat
there
though
wet
in
the
spring
they
are
all
sprouting
occasionally
when
threading
the
woods
in
the
fall
you
will
hear
a
sound
as
if
some
one
had
broken
a
twig
and
looking
up
see
a
jay
pecking
at
an
acorn
or
you
will
see
a
flock
of
them
at
once
about
it
in
the
top
of
an
oak
and
hear
them
break
it
off
they
then
fly
to
a
suitable
limb
and
placing
the
acorn
under
one
foot
hammer
away
at
it
busily
making
a
sound
like
a
woodpecker
tapping
looking
round
from
time
to
time
to
see
if
any
foe
is
approaching
and
soon
reach
the
meat
and
nibble
at
it
holding
up
their
heads
to
swallow
while
they
hold
the
remainder
very
firmly
with
their
claws
nevertheless
it
often
drops
to
the
ground
before
the
bird
has
done
with
it
i
can
confirm
what
william
barton
wrote
to
wilson
the
ornithologist
that
the
jay
is
one
of
the
most
useful
agents
in
the
economy
of
nature
for
disseminating
forest
trees
and
other
nuciferous
and
vegetables
on
which
they
feed
in
performing
this
necessary
duty
they
drop
abundance
of
seed
in
their
flight
over
fields
hedges
and
by
fences
where
they
alight
to
deposit
them
in
the
post
holes
etc
it
is
remarkable
what
numbers
of
young
trees
rise
up
in
fields
and
pastures
after
a
wet
winter
and
spring
these
birds
alone
are
capable
in
a
few
years
time
to
replant
all
the
cleared
lands
i
have
noticed
that
squirrels
also
frequently
drop
nuts
in
open
land
which
will
still
further
account
for
the
oaks
and
walnuts
which
spring
up
in
pastures
for
depend
on
it
every
new
tree
comes
from
a
seed
when
i
examine
the
little
oaks
one
or
two
years
old
in
such
places
i
invariably
find
the
empty
acorn
from
which
they
sprung

xcv
man
and
the
inferior
animals
the
chief
difference
between
man
and
the
other
animals
consists
in
this
that
the
former
has
reason
whereas
the
latter
have
only
instinct
but
in
order
to
understand
what
we
mean
by
the
terms
reason
and
instinct
it
will
be
necessary
to
mention
three
things
in
which
the
difference
very
distinctly
appears
let
us
first
to
bring
the
parties
as
nearly
on
a
level
as
possible
consider
man
in
a
savage
state
wholly
occupied
like
the
beasts
of
the
field
in
providing
for
the
wants
of
his
animal
nature
and
here
the
first
distinction
that
appears
between
them
is
the
use
of
implements
when
the
savage
provides
himself
with
a
hut
or
a
wigwam
for
shelter
or
that
he
may
store
up
his
provisions
he
does
no
more
than
is
done
by
the
rabbit
the
beaver
the
bee
and
birds
of
every
species
but
the
man
can
not
make
any
progress
in
this
work
without
tools
he
must
provide
himself
with
an
ax
even
before
he
can
cut
down
a
tree
for
its
timber
whereas
these
animals
form
their
burrows
their
cells
or
their
nests
with
no
other
tools
than
those
with
which
nature
has
provided
them
in
cultivating
the
ground
also
man
can
do
nothing
without
a
spade
or
a
plow
nor
can
he
reap
what
he
has
sown
till
he
has
shaped
an
implement
with
which
to
cut
clown
his
harvest
but
the
inferior
animals
provide
for
themselves
and
their
young
without
any
of
these
things
now
for
the
second
distinction
man
in
all
his
operations
makes
mistakes
animals
make
none
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
a
thing
as
a
bird
sitting
on
a
twig
lamenting
over
her
nest
and
puzzling
her
little
head
to
know
how
to
complete
it
or
did
you
ever
see
the
cells
of
a
beehive
in
clumsy
irregular
shapes
or
observe
anything
like
a
discussion
in
the
little
community
as
if
there
were
a
difference
of
opinion
among
the
architects
the
lower
animals
are
even
better
physicians
than
we
are
for
when
they
are
ill
they
will
many
of
them
seek
out
some
particular
herb
which
they
do
not
use
as
food
and
which
possesses
a
medicinal
quality
exactly
suited
to
the
complaint
whereas
the
whole
college
of
physicians
will
dispute
for
a
century
about
the
virtues
of
a
single
drug
man
undertakes
nothing
in
which
he
is
not
more
or
less
puzzled
and
must
try
numberless
experiments
before
he
can
bring
his
undertakings
to
anything
like
perfection
even
the
simplest
operations
of
domestic
life
are
not
well
performed
without
some
experience
and
the
term
of
man
life
is
half
wasted
before
he
has
done
with
his
mistakes
and
begins
to
profit
by
his
lessons
the
third
distinction
is
that
animals
make
no
improvements
while
the
knowledge
and
skill
and
the
success
of
man
are
perpetually
on
the
increase
animals
in
all
their
operations
follow
the
first
impulse
of
nature
or
that
instinct
which
god
has
implanted
in
them
in
all
they
do
undertake
therefore
their
works
are
more
perfect
and
regular
than
those
of
man
but
man
having
been
endowed
with
the
faculty
of
thinking
or
reasoning
about
what
he
does
is
enabled
by
patience
and
industry
to
correct
the
mistakes
into
which
he
at
first
falls
and
to
go
on
constantly
improving
a
bird
nest
is
indeed
a
perfect
structure
yet
the
nest
of
a
swallow
of
the
nineteenth
century
is
not
at
all
more
commodious
or
elegant
than
those
that
were
built
amid
the
rafters
of
noah
ark
but
if
we
compare
the
wigwam
of
the
savage
with
the
temples
and
palaces
of
ancient
greece
and
rome
we
then
shall
see
to
what
man
mistakes
rectified
and
improved
upon
conduct
him
when
the
vast
sun
shall
veil
his
golden
light
deep
in
the
gloom
of
everlasting
night
when
wild
destructive
flames
shall
wrap
the
skies
when
ruin
triumphs
and
when
nature
dies
man
shall
alone
the
wreck
of

survive

it
was
six
men
of

learning
much
inclined
who
went
to
see
the
elephant
though
all
of
them
were
blind
that
each
by
observation
might
satisfy
his
mind
the
first
approached
the
elephant
and
happening
to
fall
against
his
broad
and
sturdy
side
at
once
began
to
bawl
god
bless
me
but
the
elephant
is
very
like
a
wall
the
second
feeling
of
the
tusk
cried
ha
what
have
we
here
so
very
round
and
smooth
and
sharp
to
me
is
very
clear
this
wonder
of
an
elephant
is
very
like
a
spear
the
third
approached
the
animal
and
happening
to
take
the
squirming
trunk
within

thus
boldly
up
he
spake

quoth
he
the
elephant
is
very

the
fourth

out
his
eager
hand
and
fell
about
the
knee
what
most
this
wondrous
beast
is
like
is
very
plain
quoth
he
is
clear
enough
the
elephant
is
very
like
a
tree
the
fifth
who
chanced
to
touch
the
ear
said

this

can
this
marvel
of

grope

fell
within

scope
i
see
quoth
he
the
elephant
is
very
like
a
rope

so
these
men

out
insensibly

what

it

square
volume
with
heavy

often

prettily

pages
which
lie
between

and
which
hold

there
are
the

your

it
seems
as
if
they
were
born
a
long
time
ago
and
even
your
own
date
of
birth
appears
an
almost
incredible
distance
back
then
there
are
the
marriages
only
one
as
yet
and
your

looks
oddly

be

though
only
by
the
turning
of
a
leaf
and
over
your
thoughts
as
you
look
at
that
page
of
the

there
sometimes
wanders
a
vague
shadowy
fear
which
will
come
that
your
own

may
soon
be
there
you
try
to
drop
the
notion
as
if
it
were
not
fairly
your
own
you
affect
to
slight
it
as
you
would
slight
a
boy
who
presumed
on
your
acquaintance
but
whom
you
have
no
desire
to
know
yet
your
mother
how
strange
it
is
has
no
fears
of
such
dark
fancies
even
now
as
you
stand
beside
her
and
as
the
twilight
deepens
in
the
room
her
low
silvery
voice
is
stealing
upon
your
ear
telling
you
that
she
can
not
be
long
with
you
that
the
time
is
coming
when
you
must
be
guided
by
your
own
judgment
and
struggle
with
the
world
unaided
by
the
friends
of
your
boyhood
there
is
a
little
pride
and
a
great
deal
more
of
anxiety
in
your
thoughts
now
as
you
look
steadfastly
into
the
home
blaze
while
those
delicate
fingers
so
tender
of
your
happiness
play
with
the
locks
upon
your
brow
to
struggle
with
the
world
that
is
a
proud
thing
to
struggle
alone
there
lies
the
doubt
then
crowds
in
swift
upon
the
calm
of
boyhood
the
first
anxious
thought
of
youth
the

the
creations
of
his
genius
says
bryant
shall
survive
through
centuries
to
come
and
only
perish
with
our
language
the
following
selection
is
from
the
pilot
the
ship
which
the
american
frigate
had
now
to
oppose
was
a
vessel
of
near
her
own
size
and
equipage
and
when
griffith
looked
at
her
again
he
perceived
that
she
had
made
her
preparations
to
assert
her
equality
in
manful
fight
her
sails
had
been
gradually
reduced
to
the
usual
quantity
and
by
certain
movements
on
her
decks
the
lieutenant
and
his
constant
attendant
the
pilot
well
understood
that
she
only
wanted
to
lessen
the
distance
a
few
hundred
yards
to
begin
the
action
now
spread
everything
whispered
the
stranger
griffith
applied
the
trumpet
to
his
mouth
and
shouted
in
a
voice
that
was
carried
even
to
his
enemy
let
fall
out
with
your
booms
sheet
home
hoist
away
of
everything
the
inspiring
cry
was
answered
by
a
universal
bustle
fifty
men
flew
out
on
the
dizzy
heights
of
the
different
spars
while
broad
sheets
of
canvas
rose
as
suddenly
along
the
masts
as
if
some
mighty
bird
were
spreading
its
wings
the
englishman
instantly
perceived
his
mistake
and
he
answered
the
artifice
by
a
roar
of
artillery
griffith
watched
the
effects
of
the
broadside
with
an
absorbing
interest
as
the
shot
whistled
above
his
head
but
when
he
perceived
his
masts
untouched
and
the
few
unimportant
ropes
only
that
were
cut
he
replied
to
the
uproar
with
a
burst
of
pleasure
a
few
men
were
however
seen
clinging
with
wild
frenzy
to
the
cordage
dropping
from
rope
to
rope
like
wounded
birds
fluttering
through
a
tree
until
they
fell
heavily
into
the
ocean
the
sullen
ship
sweeping
by
them
in
a
cold
indifference
at
the
next
instant
the
spars
and
masts
of
their
enemy
exhibited
a
display
of
men
similar
to
their
own
when
griffith
again
placed
the
trumpet
to
his
mouth
and
shouted
aloud
give
it
to
them
drive
them
from
their
yards
boys
scatter
them
with
your
grape
unreeve
their
rigging
the
crew
of
the
american
wanted
but
little
encouragement
to
enter
on
this
experiment
with
hearty
good
will
and
the
close
of
his
cheering
words
was
uttered
amid
the
deafening
roar
of
his
own
cannon
the
pilot
had
however
mistaken
the
skill
and
readiness
of
their
foe
for
notwithstanding
the
disadvantageous
circumstances
under
which
the
englishman
increased
his
sail
the
duty
was
steadily
and
dexterously
performed
the
two
ships
were
now
running
rapidly
on
parallel
lines
hurling
at
each
other
their
instruments
of
destruction
with
furious
industry
and
with
severe
and
certain
loss
to
both
though
with
no
manifest
advantage
in
favor
of
either
both
griffith
and
the
pilot
witnessed
with
deep
concern
this
unexpected
defeat
of
their
hopes
for
they
could
not
conceal
from
themselves
that
each
moment
lessened
their
velocity
through
the
water
as
the
shot
of
the
enemy
stripped
the
canvas
from
the
yards
or
dashed
aside
the
lighter
spars
in
their
terrible
progress
we
find
our
equal
here
said
griffith
to
the
stranger
the
ninety
is
heaving
up
again
like
a
mountain
and
if
we
continue
to
shorten
sail
at
this
rate
she
will
soon
be
down
upon
us
you
say
true
sir
returned
the
pilot
musing
the
man
shows
judgment
as
well
as
spirit
but
he
was
interrupted
by
merry
who
rushed
from
the
forward
part
of
the
vessel
his
whole
face
betokening
the
eagerness
of
his
spirit
and
the
importance
of
his
the
breakers
he
cried
when
nigh
enough
to
be
heard
amid
the
din
we
are
running
dead
on
a
ripple
and
the
sea
is
white
not
two
hundred
yards
ahead
the
pilot
jumped
on
a
gun
and
bending
to
catch
a
glimpse
through
the
smoke
he
shouted
in
those
clear
piercing
tones
that
could
be
even
heard
among
the
roaring
of
the
cannon
port
port
your
helm
we
are
on
the
devil
grip
pass
up
the
trumpet
sir
port
your
helm
fellow
give
it
to
them
boys
give
it
to
the
proud
english
dogs
griffith
unhesitatingly
relinquished
the
symbol
of
his
rank
fastening
his
own
firm
look
on
the
calm
but
quick
eye
of
the
pilot
and
gathering
assurance
from
the
high
confidence
he
read
in
the
countenance
of
the
stranger
the
seamen
were
too
busy
with
their
cannon
and
the
rigging
to
regard
the
new
danger
and
the
frigate
entered
one
of
the
dangerous
passes
of
the
shoals
in
the
heat
of
a
severely
contested
battle
the
wondering
looks
of
a
few
of
the
older
sailors
glanced
at
the
sheets
of
foam
that
flew
by
them
in
doubt
whether
the
wild
gambols
of
the
waves
were
occasioned
by
the
shot
of
the
enemy
when
suddenly
the
noise
of
cannon
was
succeeded
by
the
sullen
wash
of
the
disturbed
element
and
presently
the
vessel
glided
out
of
her
smoky
shroud
and
was
boldly
steering
in
the
center
of
the
narrow
passages
for
ten
breathless
minutes
longer
the
pilot
continued
to
hold
an
uninterrupted
sway
during
which
the
vessel
ran
swiftly
by
ripples
and
breakers
by
streaks
of
foam
and
darker
passages
of
deep
water
when
he
threw
down
his
trumpet
and
exclaimed
what
threatened
to
be
our
destruction
has
proved
our
keep
yonder
hill
crowned
with
wood
one
point
open
from
the
church
tower
at
its
base
and
steer
east
and
by
north
you
will
run
through
these
shoals
on
that
course
in
an
hour
and
by
so
doing
you
will
gain
five
leagues
of
your
enemy
who
will
have
to
double
their
trail
every
officer
in
the
ship
after
the
breathless
suspense
of
uncertainty
had
passed
rushed
to
those
places
where
a
view
might
be
taken
of
their
enemies
the
ninety
was
still
steering
boldly
onward
and
had
already
approached
the
which
lay
a
helpless
wreck
rolling
on
the
unruly
seas
that
were
rudely
tossing
her
on
their
wanton
billows
the
frigate
last
engaged
was
running
along
the
edge
of
the
ripple
with
her
torn
sails
flying
loosely
in
the
air
her
ragged
spars
tottering
in
the
breeze
and
everything
above
her
hull
exhibiting
the
confusion
of
a
sudden
and
check
to
her
progress
the
exulting
taunts
and
mirthful
congratulations
of
the
seamen
as
they
gazed
at
the
english
ships
were
however
soon
forgotten
in
the
attention
that
was
required
to
their
own
vessel
the
drums
beat
the
retreat
the
guns
were
lashed
the
wounded
again
removed
and
every
individual
able
to
keep
the
deck
was
required
to
lend
his
assistance
in
repairing
the
damages
to
the
frigate
and
securing
her
masts
the
promised
hour
carried
the
ship
safely
through
all
the
dangers
which
were
much
lessened
by
daylight

by
the
time
the
sun
had
begun
to
fall
over

griffith

had
not
quitted
the
deck

the

not

our

we
buried

buried
him

at

bayonets

by

struggling
moonbeam

light
and

lantern

burning

coffin
inclosed

we
wound
him
but
he
lay
like
a
warrior
taking
his
rest
with
his
martial
cloak
around
him
few
and
short
were
the
prayers
we
said
and
we
spoke
not
a
word
of
sorrow
but
we
steadfastly
gazed
on
the
face
of
the
dead
and
we
bitterly
thought
of
the
morrow
we
thought
as
we
hollowed
his
narrow
bed
and
smoothed
down
his
lonely
pillow
that
the
foe
and
the
stranger
would
tread
his
head
and
we
far
away
on
the
billow
lightly
they
talk
of
the
spirit
that
gone
and
his
cold
ashes
upbraid
him
but
little
he
reck
if
they
let
him
sleep
on
in
a
grave
where
a
briton
has
laid
him
but
half
of
our
heavy
task
was
done
when
the
clock
struck
the
hour
for
retiring
and
we
heard
the
distant
random
gun
that
the
foe
was
sullenly
firing
slowly
and
sadly
we
laid
him
down
from
the
field
of
his
fame
fresh
and
gory
we
carved
not
a
line
we
raised
not
a
stone
but
we
left
him
alone
with
his
glory

ci
little
victories
o
mother
now
that
i
have
lost
my
limb
i
can
never
be
a
soldier
or
a
sailor
i
can
never
go
round
the
world
and
hugh
burst
into
tears
now
more
really
afflicted
than
he
had
ever
been
yet
his
mother
sat
on
the
bed
beside
him
and
wiped
away
his
tears
as
they
flowed
while
he
told
her
as
well
as
his
sobs
would
let
him
how
long
and
how
much
he
had
reckoned
on
going
round
the
world
and
how
little
he
cared
for
anything
else
in
future
and
now
this
was
the
very
thing
he
should
never
be
able
to
do
he
had
practiced
climbing
ever
since
he
could
remember
and
now
this
was
of
no
use
he
had
practiced
marching
and
now
he
should
never
march
again
when
he
had
finished
his
complaint
there
was
a
pause
and
his
mother
said
hugh
you
have
heard
of
huber
the
man
who
found
out
so
lunch
about
bees
said
hugh
bees
and
ants
when
huber
had
discovered
more
than
had
ever
been
known
about
these
and
when
he
was
sure
that
he
could
learn
still
more
and
was
more
and
more
anxious
to
peep
into
their
tiny
homes
and
curious
ways
he
became
blind
hugh
sighed
and
his
mother
went
on
did
you
ever
hear
of
beethoven
he
was
one
of
the
greatest
musical
composers
that
ever
lived
his
great
his
sole
delight
was
in
music
it
was
the
passion
of
his
life
when
all
his
time
and
all
his
mind
were
given
to
music
he
suddenly
became
deaf
perfectly
deaf
so
that
he
never
more
heard
one
single
note
from
the
loudest
orchestra
while
crowds
were
moved
and
delighted
with
his
compositions
it
was
all
silence
to
him
hugh
said
nothing
now
do
you
think
asked
his
mother
and
hugh
saw
that
a
mild
and
gentle
smile
beamed
from
her
countenance
do
you
think
that
these
people
were
without
a
heavenly
parent
o
no
but
were
they
patient
asked
hugh
yes
in
their
different
ways
and
degrees
would
you
suppose
that
they
were
hardly
treated
or
would
you
not
rather
suppose
that
their
father
gave
them
something
better
to
do
than
they
had
planned
for
themselves
he
must
know
best
of
course
but
it
does
seem
very
hard
that
that
very
thing
should
happen
to
them
huber
would
not
have
so
much
minded
being
deaf
perhaps
or
that
musical
man
being
blind
no
doubt
their
hearts
often
swelled
within
them
at
their
disappointments
but
i
fully
believe
that
they
very
soon
found
god
will
to
be
wiser
than
their
wishes
they
found
if
they
bore
their
trial
well
that
there
was
work
for
their
hearts
to
do
far
nobler
than
any
the
head
could
do
through
the
eye
or
the
ear
and
they
soon
felt
a
new
and
delicious
pleasure
which
none
but
the
bitterly
disappointed
can
feel
what
is
that
the
pleasure
of
rousing
the
soul
to
bear
pain
and
of
agreeing
with
god
silently
when
nobody
knows
what
is
in
the
breast
there
is
no
pleasure
like
that
of
exercising
one
soul
in
bearing
pain
and
of
finding
one
heart
glow
with
the
hope
that
one
is
pleasing
god
shall
i
feel
that
pleasure
often
and
often
i
have
no
doubt
every
time
you
can
willingly
give
up
your
wish
to
be
a
soldier
or
a
sailor
or
anything
else
you
have
set
your
mind
upon
you
will
feel
that
pleasure
but
i
do
not
expect
it
of
you
yet
i
dare
say
it
was
long
a
bitter
thing
to
beethoven
to
see
hundreds
of
people
in
raptures
with
his
music
when
he
could
not
hear
a
note
of
it
but
did
he
ever
smile
again
asked
hugh
if
he
did
he
was
happier
than
all
the
fine
music
in
the
world
could
have
made
him
replied
his
mother
i
wonder
oh
i
wonder
if
i
shall
ever
feel
so
we
will
pray
to
god
that
you
may
shall
we
ask
him
now
hugh
clasped
his
hands
his
mother
kneeled
beside
the
bed
and
in
a
very
few
words
prayed
that
hugh
might
be
able
to
bear
his
misfortune
well
and
that
his
friends
might
give
him
such
help
and
comfort
as
god
should
approve
hugh
found
himself
subject
to
very
painful
feelings
sometimes
such
as
no
one
quite
understood
and
such
as
he
feared
no
one
was
able
to
pity
as
they
deserved
on
one
occasion
when
he
had
been
quite
merry
for
a
while
and
his
mother
and
his
sister
agnes
were
chatting
they
thought
they
heard
a
sob
from
the
sofa
they
spoke
to
hugh
and
found
that
he
was
indeed
crying
bitterly
what
is
it
my
dear
said
his
mother
agnes
have
we
said
anything
that
could
hurt
his
feelings
no
no
sobbed
hugh
i
will
tell
you
presently
and
presently
he
told
them
that
he
was
so
busy
listening
to
what
they
said
that
he
forgot
everything
else
when
he
felt
as
if
something
had
gotten
between
two
of
his
toes
unconsciously
he
put
down
his
hand
as
if
his
foot
were
there
nothing
could
be
plainer
than
the
feeling
in
his
toes
and
then
when
he
put
out
his
hand
and
found
nothing
it
was
so
terrible
it
startled
him
so
it
was
a
comfort
to
find
that
his
mother
knew
about
this
she
came
and
kneeled
by
his
sofa
and
told
him
that
many
persons
who
had
lost
a
limb
considered
this
the
most
painful
thing
they
had
to
bear
for
some
time
but
that
though
the
feeling
would
return
occasionally
through
life
it
would
cease
to
be
painful
hugh
was
very
much
dejected
and
when
he
thought
of
the
months
and
years
to
the
end
of
his
life
and
that
he
should
never
run
and
play
and
never
be
like
other
people
he
almost
wished
that
he
were
dead
agnes
thought
that
he
must
be
miserable
indeed
if
he
could
venture
to
say
this
to
his
mother
she
glanced
at
her
mother
face
but
there
was
no
displeasure
there
on
the
contrary
she
said
this
feeling
was
very
natural
she
had
felt
it
herself
under
smaller
misfortunes
than
hugh
but
she
had
found
though
the
prospect
appeared
all
strewn
with
troubles
that
they
came
singly
and
were
not
so
hard
to
bear
after
all
she
told
hugh
that
when
she
was
a
little
girl
she
was
very
lazy
fond
of
her
bed
and
not
at
all
fond
of
dressing
or
washing
mother
you
exclaimed
hugh
yes
that
was
the
sort
of
little
girl
i
was
well
i
was
in
despair
one
day
at
the
thought
that
i
should
have
to
wash
and
clean
my
teeth
and
brush
my
hair
and
put
on
every
article
of
dress
every
morning
as
long
as
i
lived
did
you
tell
anybody
asked
hugh
no
i
was
ashamed
to
do
that
but
i
remember
i
cried
you
see
how
it
turns
out
when
we
have
become
accustomed
to
anything
we
do
it
without
ever
thinking
of
the
trouble
and
as
the
old
fable
tells
us
the
clock
that
has
to
tick
so
many
millions
of
times
has
exactly
the
same
number
of
seconds
to
do
it
in
so
will
you
find
that
you
can
move
about
on
each
separate
occasion
as
you
wish
and
practice
will
enable
you
to
do
it
without
any
trouble
or
thought
but
this
is
not
all
nor
half
what
i
mean
said
hugh
no
my
dear
nor
half
what
you
will
have
to
bear
you
resolved
to
bear
it
all
patiently
i
remember
but
what
is
it
you
dread
the
most
oh
all
manner
of
things
i
can
never
do
like
other
people
some
things
replied
his
mother
you
can
never
play
cricket
as
every
crofton
boy
would
like
to
do
you
can
never
dance
at
your
christmas
parties
o
mamma
cried
agnes
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
with
the
thought
in
her
mind
that
it
was
cruel
to
talk
so
go
on
go
on
cried
hugh
brightening
you
know
what
i
feel
mother
and
you
do
keep
telling
me
as
others
do
and
even
sister
agnes
sometimes
that
it
will
not
signify
much
and
that
i
shall
not
care
and
all
that
making
out
that
it
is
no
misfortune
hardly
when
i
know
what
it
is
and
they
do
now
then
go
on
mother
what
else
there
will
be
little
checks
and
mortifications
continually
when
you
see
little
boys
leaping
over
this
and
climbing
that
and
playing
at
the
other
while
you
must
stand
out
and
can
only
look
on
and
some
people
will
pity
you
in
a
way
you
will
not
like
and
some
may
even
laugh
at
you
o
mamma
exclaimed
agnes
well
and
what
else
said
hugh
sooner
or
later
you
will
have
to
follow
some
way
of
life
determined
by
this
accident
instead
of
one
that
you
would
have
liked
better
well
what
else
i
must
ask
you
now
i
can
think
of
nothing
more
and
i
hope
there
is
not
much
else
for
indeed
i
think
here
is
quite
enough
for
a
boy
or
anyone
else
to
bear
i
will
bear
it
though
you
will
see
you
will
find
great
helps
these
misfortunes
of
themselves
strengthen
one
mind
they
have
some
advantages
too
you
will
be
a
better
scholar
for
your
lameness
i
have
no
doubt
you
will
read
more
books
and
have
a
mind
richer
in
thoughts
you
will
be
more
beloved
by
us
all
and
you
yourself
will
love
god
more
for
having
given
you
something
to
bear
for
his
sake
god
himself
will
help
you
to
bear
your
trials
you
will
conquer

mr
helps
was
a
true
thinker
and
his
writings
are
deservedly
popular
with
thoughtful
readers
in
he
was
appointed
secretary
of
the
privy
council
regarding
one
day
in
company
with
a
humorous
friend
a
noble
vessel
of
a
somewhat
novel
construction
sailing
slowly
out
of
port
he
observed
what
a
quantity
of
cold
water
somebody
must
have
had
down
his
back
in
my
innocence
i
supposed
that
he
alluded
to
the
wet
work
of
the
artisans
who
had
been
building
the
vessel
but
when
i
came
to
know
him
better
i
found
that
this
was
the
form
of
comment
he
always
indulged
in
when
contemplating
any
new
and
great
work
and
that
his
somebody
was
the
designer
of
the
vessel
my
friend
had
carefully
studied
the
art
of
discouragement
and
there
was
a
class
of
men
whom
he
designated
simply
as
pourers
it
was
most
amusing
to
hear
him
describe
the
lengthened
sufferings
of
the
man
who
first
designed
a
wheel
of
him
who
first
built
a
boat
of
the
adventurous
personage
who
first
proposed
the
daring
enterprise
of
using
buttons
instead
of
fish
bones
to
fasten
the
scanty
raiment
of
some
savage
tribe
warming
with
his
theme
he
would
become
quite
eloquent
in
describing
the
long
career
of
discouragement
which
these
rash
men
had
brought
upon
themselves
and
which
he
said
to
his
knowledge
must
have
shortened
their
lives
he
invented
imaginary
dialogues
between
the
unfortunate
inventor
say
of
the
wheel
and
his
particular
friend
some
eminent
pourer
for
as
he
said
every
man
has
some
such
friend
who
fascinates
him
by
fear
and
to
whom
he
confides
his
enterprises
in
order
to
hear
the
worst
that
can
be
said
of
them
the
sayings
of
the
chilling
friend
probably
as
he
observed
ran
thus
we
seem
to
have
gone
on
very
well
for
thousands
of
years
without
this
rolling
thing
your
father
carried
burdens
on
his
back
the
king
is
content
to
be
borne
on
men
shoulders
the
high
priest
is
not
too
proud
to
do
the
same
indeed
i
question
whether
it
is
not
irreligious
to
attempt
to
shift
from
men
shoulders
their
natural
burdens
then
as
to
its
succeeding
for
my
part
i
see
no
chance
of
that
how
can
it
go
up
hill
how
often
you
have
failed
before
in
other
fanciful
things
of
the
same
nature
besides
you
are
losing
your
time
and
the
yams
about
your
hut
are
only
half
planted
you
will
be
a
beggar
and
it
is
my
duty
as
a
friend
to
tell
you
so
plainly
there
was
what
became
of
him
we
had
found
fire
for
ages
in
a
proper
way
taking
a
proper
time
about
it
by
rubbing
two
sticks
together
he
must
needs
strike
out
fire
at
once
with
iron
and
flint
and
did
he
die
in
his
bed
our
sacred
lords
saw
the
impiety
of
that
proceeding
and
very
justly
impaled
the
man
who
imitated
heavenly
powers
and
even
if
you
could
succeed
with
this
new
and
absurd
rolling
thing
the
state
would
be
ruined
what
would
become
of
those
who
carry
burdens
on
their
backs
put
aside
the
vain
fancies
of
a
childish
mind
and
finish
the
planting
of
your
yams
it
is
really
very
curious
to
observe
how
even
in
modern
times
the
arts
of
discouragement
prevail
there
are
men
whose
sole
pretense
to
wisdom
consists
in
administering
discouragement
they
are
never
at
a
loss
they
are
equally
ready
to
prophesy
with
wonderful
ingenuity
all
possible
varieties
of
misfortune
to
any
enterprise
that
may
be
proposed
and
when
the
thing
is
produced
and
has
met
with
some
success
to
find
a
flaw
in
it
i
once
saw
a
work
of
art
produced
in
the
presence
of
an
eminent
pourer
he
did
not
deny
that
it
was
beautiful
but
he
instantly
fastened
upon
a
small
crack
in
it
that
nobody
had
observed
and
upon
that
crack
he
would
dilate
whenever
the
work
was
discussed
in
his
presence
indeed
he
did
not
see
the
work
but
only
the
crack
in
it
that
flaw
that
little
flaw
was
all
in
all
to
him
the
pourers
are
not
all
of
one
form
of
mind
some
are
led
to
indulge
in
this
recreation
from
genuine
timidity
they
really
do
fear
that
all
new
attempts
will
fail
others
are
simply
envious
and
then
again
there
is
a
sense
of
power
and
wisdom
in
prophesying
evil
moreover
it
is
the
safest
thing
to
prophesy
for
hardly
anything
at
first
succeeds
exactly
in
the
way
that
it
was
intended
to
succeed
again
there
is
the
lack
of
imagination
which
gives
rise
to
the
utterance
of
so
much
discouragement
for
an
ordinary
man
it
must
have
been
a
great
mental
strain
to
grasp
the
ideas
of
the
first
projectors
of
steam
and
gas
electric
telegraphs
and
chloroform
the
inventor
is
always
in
the
eyes
of
his
somewhat
of
a
madman
and
often
they
do
their
best
to
make
him
so
again
there
is
the
want
of
sympathy
and
that
is
perhaps
the
ruling
cause
in
most
men
minds
who
have
given
themselves
up
to
discourage
they
are
not
tender
enough
or
sympathetic
enough
to
appreciate
all
the
pain
they
are
giving
when
in
a
dull
plodding
way
they
lay
out
argument
after
argument
to
show
that
the
project
which
the
poor
inventor
has
set
his
heart
upon
and
upon
which
perhaps
he
has
staked
his
fortune
will
not
succeed
but
what
inventors
suffer
is
only
a
small
part
of
what
mankind
in
general
endure
from
thoughtless
and
unkind
discouragement
those
men
belong
to
the
suffering
class
and
must
suffer
but
it
is
in
daily
life
that
the
wear
and
tear
of
discouragement
tells
so
much
propose
a
small
party
of
pleasure
to
an
apt
discourager
and
see
what
he
will
make
of
it
it
soon
becomes
sicklied
over
with
doubt
and
despondency
and
at
last
the
only
hope
of
the
proposer
is
that
his
proposal
when
realized
will
not
be
an
ignominious
failure
all
hope
of
pleasure
at

audubon
b
this
celebrated
american
ornithologist
was
born
in
louisiana
when
quite
young
he
was
passionately
fond
of
birds
and
took
delight
in
studying
their
habits
in
his
father
an
admiral
in
the
french
navy
sent
him
to
paris
to
be
educated
on
his
return
to
america
he
settled
on
a
farm
in
eastern
pennsylvania
but
afterward
removed
to
henderson
where
he
resided
several
years
supporting
his
family
by
trade
but
devoting
most
of
his
time
to
the
pursuit
of
his
favorite
study
in
he
went
to
england
and
commenced
the
publication
of
the
birds
of
america
which
consists
of
ten
volumes
five
of
engravings
of
birds
natural
size
and
five

cuvier
declares
this
work
to
be
the
most
magnificent
monument
that
art
has
ever
erected
to
ornithology
in
audubon
returned
to
america
and
soon
afterwards
made
excursions
into
nearly
every
section
of
the
united
states
and
canada
a
popular
edition
of
his
great
work
was
published
in
seven
volumes
in
and

quadrupeds
of

in

volumes

of

until
his
death
the
multitudes
of
wild
pigeons
in
our
woods
are
astonishing
indeed
after
having
viewed
them
so
often
and
under
so
many
circumstances
i
even
now
feel
inclined
to
pause
and
assure
myself
that
what
i
am
going
to
relate
is
a
fact
yet
i
have
seen
it
all
and
that
too
in
the
company
of
persons
who
like
myself
were
struck
with
amazement
in
the
autumn
of
i
left
my
house
at
henderson
on
the
banks
of
the
ohio
on
my
way
to
louisville
in
passing
over
the
barrens
a
few
miles
beyond
hardinsburgh
i
observed
the
pigeons
flying
from
northeast
to
southwest
in
greater
numbers
than
i
thought
i
had
ever
seen
them
before
and
feeling
an
inclination
to
count
the
flocks
that
might
pass
within
the
reach
of
my
eye
in
one
hour
i
dismounted
seated
myself
on
an
eminence
and
began
to
mark
with
my
pencil
making
a
dot
for
every
flock
that
passed
in
a
short
time
finding
the
task
which
i
had
undertaken
impracticable
as
the
birds
poured
in
in
countless
multitudes
i
rose
and
counting
the
dots
then
put
down
found
that
one
hundred
and
had
been
made
in
minutes
i
traveled
on
and
still
met
more
the
farther
i
proceeded
the
air
was
literally
filled
with
pigeons
the
light
of
noonday
was
obscured
as
by
an
eclipse
and
the
continued
buzz
of
wings
had
a
tendency
to
lull
my
senses
to
repose
whilst
waiting
for
dinner
at
young
inn
at
the
confluence
of
salt
river
with
the
ohio
i
saw
at
my
leisure
immense
legions
still
going
by
with
a
front
reaching
far
beyond
the
ohio
on
the
west
and
the
beech
wood
forests
directly
on
the
east
of
me
not
a
single
bird
alighted
for
not
a
nut
or
acorn
was
that
year
to
be
seen
in
the
neighborhood
they
consequently
flew
so
high
that
different
trials
to
reach
them
with
a
capital
rifle
proved
ineffectual
nor
did
the
reports
disturb
them
in
the
least
i
can
not
describe
to
you
the
extreme
beauty
of
their
aerial
evolutions
when
a
hawk
chanced
to
press
upon
the
rear
of
a
flock
at
once
like
a
torrent
and
with
a
noise
like
thunder
they
rushed
into
a
compact
mass
pressing
upon
each
other
towards
the
center
in
these
almost
solid
masses
they
darted
forward
in
undulating
and
angular
lines
descended
and
swept
close
over
the
earth
with
inconceivable
velocity
mounted
perpendicularly
so
as
to
resemble
a
vast
column
and
when
high
were
seen
wheeling
and
twisting
within
their
continued
lines
which
then
resembled
the
coils
of
a
gigantic
serpent
as
soon
as
the
pigeons
discover
a
sufficiency
of
food
to
entice
them
to
alight
they
fly
round
in
circles
reviewing
the
country
below
during
their
evolutions
on
such
occasions
the
dense
mass
which
they
form
exhibits
a
beautiful
appearance
as
it
changes
its
direction
now
displaying
a
glistening
sheet
of
azure
when
the
backs
of
the
birds
come
simultaneously
into
view
and
anon
suddenly
presenting
a
mass
of
rich
deep
purple
they
then
pass
lower
over
the
woods
and
for
a
moment
are
lost
among
the
foliage
but
again
emerge
and
are
seen
gliding
aloft
they
now
alight
but
the
next
moment
as
if
suddenly
alarmed
they
take
to
wing
producing
by
the
flappings
of
their
wings
a
noise
like
the
roar
of
distant
thunder
and
sweep
through
the
forests
to
see
if
danger
is
near
hunger
however
soon
brings
them
to
the
ground
when
alighted
they
are
seen
industriously
throwing
up
the
withered
leaves
in
quest
of
the
fallen
mast
the
rear
ranks
are
continually
rising
passing
over
the
main
body
and
alighting
in
front
in
such
rapid
succession
that
the
whole
flock
seems
still
on
wing
the
quantity
of
ground
thus
swept
is
astonishing
and
so
completely
has
it
been
cleared
that
the
gleaner
who
might
follow
in
their
rear
would
find
his
labor
completely
lost
on
such
occasions
when
the
woods
are
filled
with
these
pigeons
they
are
killed
in
immense
numbers
although
no
apparent
diminution
ensues
about
the
middle
of
the
day
after
their
repast
is
finished
they
settle
on
the
trees
to
enjoy
rest
and
digest
their
food
as
the
sun
begins
to
sink
beneath
the
horizon
they
depart
en
masse
for
the
roosting
place
which
not
unfrequently
is
hundreds
of
miles
distant
as
has
been
ascertained
by
persons
who
have
kept
an
account
of
their
arrivals
and
departures
let
us
now
inspect
their
place
of
nightly
rendezvous
one
of
these
curious
roosting
places
on
the
banks
of
the
green
river
in
kentucky
i
repeatedly
visited
it
was
as
is
always
the
case
in
a
portion
of
the
forest
where
the
trees
were
of
great
magnitude
and
where
there
was
little
underwood
i
rode
through
it
upwards
of
forty
miles
and
crossing
it
in
different
parts
found
its
average
breadth
to
be
rather
more
than
three
miles
my
first
view
of
it
was
about
a
fortnight
subsequent
to
the
period
when
they
had
made
choice
of
it
and
i
arrived
there
nearly
two
hours
before
sunset
many
trees
two
feet
in
diameter
i
observed
were
broken
off
at
no
great
distance
from
the
ground
and
the
branches
of
many
of
the
largest
and
tallest
had
given
way
as
if
the
forest
had
been
swept
by
a
tornado
everything
proved
to
me
that
the
number
of
birds
resorting
to
this
part
of
the
forest
must
be
immense
beyond
conception
as
the
period
of
their
arrival
approached
their
foes
anxiously
prepared
to
receive
them
some
were
furnished
with
iron
pots
containing
sulphur
others
with
torches
of
pine
knots
many
with
poles
and
the
rest
with
guns
the
sun
was
lost
to
our
view
yet
not
a
pigeon
had
arrived
everything
was
ready
and
all
eyes
were
gazing
on
the
clear
sky
which
appeared
in
glimpses
amidst
the
tall
trees
suddenly
there
burst
forth
the
general
cry
of
here
they
come
the
noise
which
they
made
though
yet
distant
reminded
me
of
a
hard
gale
at
sea
passing
through
the
rigging
of
a
vessel
as
the
birds
arrived
and
passed
over
me
i
felt
a
current
of
air
that
surprised
me
thousands
were
soon
knocked
down
by
the
pole
men
the
birds
continued
to
pour
in
the
fires
were
lighted
and
a
magnificent
as
well
as
wonderful
and
almost
terrifying
sight
presented
itself
the
pigeons
arriving
by
thousands
alighted
everywhere
one
above
another
until
solid
masses
as
large
as
hogsheads
were
formed
on
the
branches
all
round
here
and
there
the
perches
gave
way
under
the
weight
with
a
crash
and
falling
to
the
ground
destroyed
hundreds
of
the
birds
beneath
forcing
down
the
dense
groups
with
which
every
stick
was
loaded
it
was
a
scene
of
uproar
and
confusion
i
found
it
quite
useless
to
speak
or
even
to
shout
to
those
persons
who
were
nearest
to
me
even
the
reports
of
the
guns
were
seldom
heard
and
i
was
made
aware
of
the
firing
only
by
seeing
the
shooters
reloading
the
uproar
continued
the
whole
night
and
as
i
was
anxious
to
know
to
what
distance
the
sound
reached
i
sent
off
a
man
accustomed
to
perambulate
the
forest
who
returning
two
hours
afterwards
informed
me
he
had
heard
it
distinctly
when
three
miles
distant
from
the
spot
towards
the
approach
of
day
the
noise
in
some
measure
subsided
long
before
objects
were
distinguishable
the
pigeons
began
to
move
off
in
a
direction
quite
different
from
that
in
which
they
had
arrived
the
evening
before
and
at
sunrise
all
that
were
able
to
fly

houses

almost
feudal
the
question
of
slavery
was
not
born
at
the
time
of
which
we
write
to
be
the
proprietor
of
black
servants
shocked
the
feelings
of
no
virginia
gentleman
nor
in
truth
was
the
despotism
exercised
over
the
negro
race
generally
a
savage
one
the
food
was
plenty
the
poor
black
people
lazy
and
not
unhappy
you
might
have
preached
negro
emancipation
to
madam
esmond
of
castlewood
as
you
might
have
told
her
to
let
the
horses
run
loose
out
of
the
stables
she
had
no
doubt
but
that
the
whip
and
the
corn
bag
were
good
for
both
her
father
may
have
thought
otherwise
being
of
a
skeptical
turn
on
very
many
points
but
his
doubts
did
not
break
forth
in
active
denial
and
he
was
rather
disaffected
than
rebellious
at
one
period
this
gentleman
had
taken
a
part
in
active
life
at
home
and
possibly
might
have
been
eager
to
share
its
rewards
but
in
latter
days
he
did
not
seem
to
care
for
them
a
something
had
occurred
in
his
life
which
had
cast
a
tinge
of
melancholy
over
all
his
existence
he
was
not
unhappy
to
those
about
him
most
kind
most
affectionate
obsequious
even
to
the
women
of
his
family
whom
he
scarce
ever
contradicted
but
there
had
been
some
bankruptcy
of
his
heart
which
his
spirit
never
recovered
he
submitted
to
life
rather
than
enjoyed
it
and
never
was
in
better
spirits
than
in
his
last
hours
when
he
was
going
to
lay
it
down
when
the
boys
grandfather
died
their
mother
in
great
state
proclaimed
her
eldest
son
george
her
successor
and
heir
of
the
estate
and
harry
george
younger
brother
by
half
an
hour
was
always
enjoined
to
respect
his
senior
all
the
household
was
equally
instructed
to
pay
him
honor
the
negroes
of
whom
there
was
a
large
and
happy
family
and
the
assigned
servants
from
europe
whose
lot
was
made
as
bearable
as
it
might
be
under
the
government
of
the
lady
of
castlewood
in
the
whole
family
there
scarcely
was
a
rebel
save
faithful
friend
and
companion
madam
mountain
and
harry
foster
mother
a
faithful
negro
woman
who
never
could
be
made
to
understand
why
her
child
should
not
be
first
who
was
handsomer
and
stronger
and
cleverer
than
his
brother
as
she
vowed
though
in
truth
there
was
scarcely
any
difference
in
the
beauty
strength
or
stature
of
the
twins
in
disposition
they
were
in
many
points
exceedingly
unlike
but
in
feature
they
resembled
each
other
so
closely
that
but
for
the
color
of
their
hair
it
had
been
difficult
to
distinguish
them
in
their
beds
and
when
their
heads
were
covered
with
those
vast
ribboned
nightcaps
which
our
great
and
little
ancestors
wore
it
was
scarcely
possible
for
any
but
a
nurse
or
a
mother
to
tell
the
one
from
the
other
child
howbeit
alike
in
form
we
have
said
that
they
differed
in
temper
the
elder
was
peaceful
studious
and
silent
the
younger
was
warlike
and
noisy
he
was
quick
at
learning
when
he
began
but
very
slow
at
beginning
no
threats
of
the
ferule
would
provoke
harry
to
learn
in
an
idle
fit
or
would
prevent
george
from
helping
his
brother
in
his
lesson
harry
was
of
a
strong
military
turn
drilled
the
little
negroes
on
the
estate
and
caned
them
like
a
corporal
having
many
good
boxing
matches
with
them
and
never
bearing
malice
if
he
was
worsted
whereas
george
was
sparing
of
blows
and
gentle
with
all
about
him
as
the
custom
in
all
families
was
each
of
the
boys
had
a
special
little
servant
assigned
him
and
it
was
a
known
fact
that
george
finding
his
little
wretch
of
a
blackamoor
asleep
on
his
master
bed
sat
down
beside
it
and
brushed
the
flies
off
the
child
with
a
feather
fan
to
the
horror
of
old
gumbo
the
child
father
who
found
his
young
master
so
engaged
and
to
the
indignation
of
madam
esmond
who
ordered
the
young
negro
off
to
the
proper
officer
for
a
whipping
in
vain
george
implored
and
entreated
burst
into
passionate
tears
and
besought
a
remission
of
the
sentence
his
mother
was
inflexible
regarding
the
young
punishment
and
the
little
negro
went
off
beseeching
his
young
master
not
to
cry
on
account
of
a
certain
apish
drollery
and
humor
which
exhibited
itself
in
the
lad
and
a
liking
for
some
of
the
old
man
pursuits
the
first
of
the
twins
was
the
grandfather
favorite
and
companion
and
would
laugh
and
talk
out
all
his
infantine
heart
to
the
old
gentleman
to
whom
the
younger
had
seldom
a
word
to
say
george
was
a
demure
studious
boy
and
his
senses
seemed
to
brighten
up
in
the
library
where
his
brother
was
so
gloomy
he
knew
the
books
before
he
could
carry
them
and
read
in
them
long
before
he
could
understand
them
harry
on
the
other
hand
was
all
alive
in
the
stables
or
in
the
wood
eager
for
all
parties
of
hunting
and
fishing
and
promised
to
be
a
good
sportsman
from
a
very
early
age
at
length
the
time
came
when
esmond
was
to
have
done
with
the
affairs
of
this
life
and
he
laid
them
down
as
if
glad
to
be
rid
of
their
burden
all
who
read
and
heard
that
discourse
wondered
where
parson
broadbent
of
james

found
the
eloquence
and
the
latin
which
adorned
it
perhaps

corrected

was
printed
by
the

of
his
excellency

many
persons
of
honor
at
franklin
press
in
philadelphia
no
such
sumptuous
funeral
had
ever
bean
seen
in
the
country
as
that
which
madam
esmond
warrington
ordained
for
her
father
who
would
have
been
the
first
to
smile
at
that
pompous
grief
the
little
lads
of
castlewood
almost
smothered
in
black
trains
and
hatbands
headed
the
procession
and
were
followed
by
my
lord
fairfax

of

with
his
coach
by
the
randolphs

and
many
others
for
the
whole
country
esteemed
the
departed
gentleman
whose
goodness
whose
high
talents
whose
benevolence
and
unobtrusive
urbanity
had
earned
for
him
the
just
respect
of
his
neighbors
when
informed
of
the
event
the
family
of
colonel
esmond
stepson
the
lord
castlewood
of
hampshire
in
england
asked
to
be
at
the
charges
of
the

slab
which
recorded
the
names
and
virtues
of
his
lordship
mother
and
her
husband
and
after
due
time
of
preparation
the
monument
was
set
up

arms
and
coronet
of
the
esmonds
supported
by
a
little
chubby
group
of
weeping

charles
lamb
b
was
born
in
london
he
was
educated
at
christ
hospital
where
he
was
a
schoolfellow
and
intimate
friend
of
coleridge
in
he
became
a
clerk
in
the
india
house
london
and
in
he
retired
from
his
clerkship
on
a
pension
of
pounds
lamb
never
married
but
devoted
his
life
to
the
care
of
his
sister
mary
who
was
at
times
insane
he
wrote
tales
founded
on
the
plays
of
shakespeare
and
several
other
works
of
rare
merit
but
his
literary
fame
rests
principally
on
the
inimitable
essays
of
elia
published
originally
in
the
london
magazine
from
one
of
which
the
following
selection
is
adapted
mankind
says
a
chinese
manuscript
which
my
friend
was
obliging
enough
to
read
and
explain
to
me
for
the
first
seventy
thousand
ages
ate
their
meat
raw
clawing
or
biting
it
from
the
living
animal
just
as
they
do
in
abyssinia
to
this
day
this
period
is
not
obscurely
hinted
at
by
their
great
confucius
in
the
second
chapter
of
his
mundane
mutations
where
he
designates
a
kind
of
golden
age
by
the
term
literally
the
cooks
holiday
the
manuscript
goes
on
to
say
that
the
art
of
roasting
or
rather
broiling
which
i
take
to
be
the
elder
brother
was
accidentally
discovered
in
the
manner
following
the
swineherd
having
gone
out
into
the
woods
one
morning
as
his
manner
was
to
collect
mast
for
his
hogs
left
his
cottage
in
the
care
of
his
eldest
son
a
great
lubberly
boy
who
being
fond
of
playing
with
fire
as
younkers
of
his
age
commonly
are
let
some
sparks
escape
into
a
bundle
of
straw
which
kindling
quickly
spread
the
conflagration
over
every
part
of
their
poor
mansion
till
it
was
reduced
to
ashes
together
with
the
cottage
a
sorry
antediluvian
makeshift
of
a
building
you
may
think
it
what
was
of
much
more
importance
a
fine
litter
of
newborn
pigs
no
less
than
nine
in
number
perished
china
pigs
have
been
esteemed
a
luxury
all
over
the
east
from
the
remotest
periods
we
read
of
was
in
the
utmost
consternation
as
you
may
think
not
so
much
for
the
sake
of
the
tenement
which
his
father
and
he
could
easily
build
up
again
with
a
few
dry
branches
and
the
labor
of
an
hour
or
two
at
any
time
as
for
the
loss
of
the
pigs
while
he
was
thinking
what
he
should
say
to
his
father
and
wringing
his
hands
over
the
smoking
remnants
of
one
of
those
untimely
sufferers
an
odor
assailed
his
nostrils
unlike
any
scent
which
he
had
before
experienced
what
could
it
proceed
from
not
from
the
burnt
cottage
he
had
smelt
that
smell
before
indeed
this
was
by
no
means
the
first
accident
of
the
kind
which
had
occurred
through
the
negligence
of
this
unlucky
young
firebrand
much
less
did
it
resemble
that
of
any
known
herb
weed
or
flower
a
premonitory
moistening
at
the
same
time
overflowed
his
nether
lip
he
knew
not
what
to
think
he
next
stooped
down
to
feel
the
pig
if
there
were
any
signs
of
life
in
it
he
burnt
his
fingers
and
to
cool
them
he
applied
them
in
his
booby
fashion
to
his
mouth
some
of
the
crumbs
of
the
scorched
skin
had
come
away
with
his
fingers
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
in
the
life
indeed
for
before
him
no
man
had
known
it
he
tasted
crackling
again
he
felt
and
fumbled
at
the
pig
it
did
not
burn
him
so
much
now
still
he
licked
his
fingers
from
a
sort
of
habit
the
truth
at
length
broke
into
his
slow
understanding
that
it
was
the
pig
that
smelt
so
and
the
pig
that
tasted
so
delicious
and
surrendering
himself
up
to
the
newborn
pleasure
he
fell
to
tearing
up
whole
handfuls
of
the
scorched
skin
with
the
flesh
next
it
and
was
cramming
it
down
his
throat
in
his
beastly
fashion
when
his
sire
entered
amid
the
smoking
rafters
armed
with
a
retributory
cudgel
and
finding
how
affairs
stood
began
to
rain
blows
upon
the
young
rogue
shoulders
as
thick
as
hailstones
which
heeded
not
any
more
than
if
they
had
been
flies
his
father
might
lay
on
but
he
could
not
beat
him
from
his
pig
till
he
had
fairly
made
an
end
of
it
when
becoming
a
little
more
sensible
of
his
situation
something
like
the
following
dialogue
eusued
you
graceless
whelp
what
have
you
got
there
devouring
is
it
not
enough
that
you
have
burnt
me
down
three
houses
with
your
dog
tricks
and
be
hanged
to
you
but
you
must
be
eating
fire
and
i
know
not
what
what
have
you
got
there
i
say
o

the
pig
the
pig
do
come
and
taste
how
nice
the
burnt
pig
eats
the
ears
of
tingled
with
horror
he
cursed
his
son
and
he
cursed
himself
that
he
should
ever
have
a
son
that
should
eat
burnt
pig
whose
scent
was
wonderfully
sharpened
since
morning
soon
raked
out
another
pig
and
fairly
rending
it
asunder
thrust
the
lesser
half
by
main
force
into
the
fists
of
still
shouting
out
eat
eat
eat
the
burnt
pig
father
only
taste
oh
with
such
like
barbarous
ejaculations
cramming
all
the
while
as
if
he
would
choke
trembled
in
every
joint
while
he
grasped
the
abominable
thing
wavering
whether
he
should
not
put
his
son
to
death
for
an
unnatural
young
monster
when
the
crackling
scorching
his
fingers
as
it
had
done
his
son
and
applying
the
same
remedy
to
them
he
in
his
turn
tasted
some
of
its
flavor
which
make
what
sour
mouths
he
would
for
a
pretense
proved
not
altogether
displeasing
to
him
in
conclusion
for
the
manuscript
here
is
a
little
tedious
both
father
and
son
fairly
sat
down
to
the
mess
and
never
left
off
till
they
had
dispatched
all
that
remained
of
the
litter
was
strictly
enjoined
not
to
let
the
secret
escape
for
the
neighbors
would
certainly
have
stoned
them
for
a
couple
of
abominable
wretches
who
could
think
of
improving
upon
the
good
meat
which
god
had
sent
them
nevertheless
strange
stories
got
about
it
was
observed
that
cottage
was
burnt
down
now
more
frequently
than
ever
nothing
but
fires
from
this
time
forward
some
would
break
out
in
broad
day
others
in
the
and
himself
which
was
the
more
remarkable
instead
of
chastising
his
son
seemed
to
grow
more
indulgent
to
him
than
ever
at
length
they
were
watched
the
terrible
mystery
discovered
and
father
and
son
summoned
to
take
their
trial
at
pekin
then
an
inconsiderable
assize
town
evidence
was
given
the
obnoxious
food
itself
produced
in
court
and
verdict
about
to
be
pronounced
when
the
foreman
of
the
jury
begged
that
some
of
the
burnt
pig
of
which
the
culprits
stood
accused
might
be
handed
into
the
box
he
handled
it
and
they
all
handled
it
and
burning
their
fingers
as
and
his
father
had
done
before
them
and
nature
prompting
to
each
of
them
the
same
remedy
against
the
face
of
all
the
facts
and
the
clearest
charge
which
the
judge
had
ever
given
to
the
surprise
of
the
whole
court
townsfolk
strangers
reporters
and
all
present
without
leaving
the
box
or
any
manner
of
consultation
whatever
they
brought
in
a
simultaneous
verdict
of
not
guilty
the
judge
who
was
a
shrewd
fellow
winked
at
the
manifest
iniquity
of
the
decision
and
when
the
court
was
dismissed
went
privily
and
bought
up
all
the
pigs
that
could
be
had
for
love
or
money
in
a
few
days
his
lordship
townhouse
was
observed
to
be
on
fire
the
thing
took
wing
and
now
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
fire
in
every
direction
fuel
and
pigs
grew
enormously

that

would
in
no
long
time
be
lost
to
the
world
thus
this
custom
of
firing
houses
continued
till
in
process
of
time
says
my
manuscript
a
sage
arose
like
our
locke

made
a
discovery
that
the

indeed
of

they
called
it

it

be

a

for
so
dangerous
an
experiment
as
setting
houses
on
fire
especially
in
these
days
could
be
assigned
in

at

his

the

when
she
walked
by

shores

that
were
now
getting
yellow
under
the
sunset
what
strange
and
unutterable
thoughts
must
appear
in
the
wonder
of
her
face
after
dinner
they
went
outside
and
sat
down
on
a
bench
in
the
garden
it
was
a
cool
and
pleasant
evening
the
sun
had
gone
down
in
red
fire
behind
the
atlantic
and
there
was
still
left
a
rich
glow
of
crimson
in
the
west
while
overhead
in
the
pale
yellow
of
the
sky
some
filmy
clouds
of
rose
color
lay
motionless
how
calm
was
the
sea
out
there
and
the
whiter
stretch
of
water
coming
into
loch
roag
the
cool
air
of
the
twilight
was
scented
with
sweetbrier
the
wash
of
the
ripples
along
the
coast
could
be
heard
in
the
stillness
the
girl
put
her
hand
on
her
father
head
and
reminded
him
that
she
had
had
her
big
greyhound
bras
imprisoned
all
the
afternoon
and
that
she
had
to
go
down
to
borvabost
with
a

lavender
rather
anxiously
and
she
assented
with
a
gracious
smile
and
went
to
fetch
the
great
deerhound
that
was
her
constant
companion
and
lo
he
found
himself
walking
with
a
princess
in
this
wonderland
through
the
magic
twilight
that
prevails
in
northern
latitudes
mackenzie
and
ingram
had
gone
to
the
front
the
large
deerhound
after
regarding
him
attentively
had
gone
to
its
mistress
side
and
remained
closely
there
even
sheila
when
they
had
reached
the
loftiest
part
of
their
route
and
could
see
beneath
them
the
island
and
the
water
surrounding
it
was
struck
by
the
exceeding
beauty
of
the
twilight
and
as
for
her
companion
he
remembered
it
many
a
time
thereafter
as
if
it
were
a
dream
of
the
sea
before
them
lay
the
atlantic
a
pale
line
of
blue
still
silent
and
remote
overhead
the
sky
was
of
a
clear
thin
gold
with
heavy
masses
of
violet
cloud
stretched
across
from
north
to
south
and
thickening
as
they
got
near
the
horizon
down
at
their
feet
near
the
shore
a
dusky
line
of
huts
and
houses
was
scarcely
visible
and
over
these
lay
a
pale
blue
film
of
peat
smoke
that
did
not
move
in
the
still
air
then
they
saw
the
bay
into
which
the
white
water
runs
and
they
could
trace
the
yellow
glimmer
of
the
river
stretching
into
the
island
through
a
level
valley
of
bog
and
morass
far
away
towards
the
east
lay
the
bulk
of
the
island
dark
green
undulations
of
moorland
and
pasture
and
there
in
the
darkness
the
gable
of
one
white
house
had
caught
the
clear
light
of
the
sky
and
was
gleaming
westward
like
a
star
but
all
this
was
as
nothing
to
the
glory
that
began
to
shine
in
the
southeast
where
the
sky
was
of
a
pale
violet
over
the
peaks
of
mealasabhal
and
suainabhal
there
into
the
beautiful
dome
rose
the
golden
crescent
of
the
moon
warm
in
color
as
though
it
still
retained
the
last
rays
of
the
sunset
a
line
of
quivering
gold
fell
across
loch
roag
and
touched
the
black
hull
and
spars
of
the
boat
in
which
sheila
had
been
sailing
in
the
morning
that
bay
down
there
with
its
white
sands
and
massive
rocks
its
still
expanse
of
water
and
its
background

a
picture

human
life
samuel
johnson
b
this
remarkable
man
was
born
in
lichfield
staffordshire
england
he
was
the
son
of
a
bookseller
and
stationer
he
entered
pembroke
college
oxford
in
but
his
poverty
compelled
him
to
leave
at
the
end
of
three
years
soon
after
his
marriage
in
he
opened
a
private
school
but
obtained
only
three
pupils
one
of
whom
was
david
garrick
afterwards
a
celebrated
actor
in
he
removed
to
london
where
he
resided
most
of
the
rest
of
his
life
the
most
noted
of
his
numerous
literary
works
are
his
dictionary
the
first

an
annual
pension
of
pounds
was
granted
him
in
in
person
johnson
was
heavy
and
awkward
in
manner
boorish
and
overbearing
but
his
learning
and
his
great
powers
caused
his
company
to
be
sought
by
many
eminent
men
obidah
the
son
of
abnesina
left
the
caravansary
early
in
the
morning
and
pursued
his
journey
through
the
plains
of
hindostan
he
was
fresh
and
vigorous
with
rest
he
was
animated
with
hope
he
was
incited
by
desire
he
walked
swiftly
forward
over
the
valleys
and
saw
the
hills
gradually
rising
before
him
as
he
passed
along
his
ears
were
delighted
with
the
morning
song
of
the
bird
of
paradise
he
was
fanned
by
the
last
flutters
of
the
sinking
breeze
and
sprinkled
with
dew
by
groves
of
spices
he
sometimes
contemplated
towering
height
of
the
oak
monarch
of
the
hills
and
sometimes
caught
the
gentle
fragrance
of
the
primrose
eldest
daughter
of
the
spring
all
his
senses
were
gratified
and
all
care
was
banished
from
his
heart
thus
he
went
on
till
the
sun
approached
his
meridian
and
the
increasing
heat
preyed
upon
his
strength
he
then
looked
round
about
him
for
some
more
commodious
path
he
saw
on
his
right
hand
a
grove
that
seemed
to
wave
its
shades
as
a
sign
of
invitation
he
entered
it
and
found
the
coolness
and
verdure
irresistibly
pleasant
he
did
not
however
forget
whither
he
was
traveling
but
found
a
narrow
way
bordered
with
flowers
which
appeared
to
have
the
same
direction
with
the
main
road
and
was
pleased
that
by
this
happy
experiment
he
had
found
means
to
unite
pleasure
with
business
and
to
gain
the
rewards
of
diligence
without
suffering
its
fatigues
he
therefore
still
continued
to
walk
for
a
time
without
the
least
remission
of
his
ardor
except
that
he
was
sometimes
tempted
to
stop
by
the
music
of
the
birds
which
the
heat
had
assembled
in
the
shade
and
sometimes
amused
himself
with
picking
the
flowers
that
covered
the
banks
on
each
side
or
the
fruits
that
hung
upon
the
branches
at
last
the
green
path
began
to
decline
from
its
first
tendency
and
to
wind
among
the
hills
and
thickets
cooled
with
fountains
and
murmuring
with
waterfalls
here
obidah
paused
for
a
time
and
began
to
consider
whether
it
was
longer
safe
to
forsake
the
known
and
common
track
but
remembering
that
the
heat
was
now
in
its
greatest
violence
and
that
the
plain
was
dusty
and
uneven
he
resolved
to
pursue
the
new
path
which
he
supposed
only
to
make
a
few
meanders
in
compliance
with
the
garieties
of
the
ground
and
to
end
at
last
in
the
common
road
having
thus
calmed
his
solicitude
he
renewed
his
pace
though
he
suspected
he
was
not
gaining
ground
this
uneasiness
of
his
mind
inclined
him
to
lay
hold
on
every
new
object
and
give
way
to
every
sensation
that
might
soothe
or
divert
him
he
listened
to
every
echo
he
mounted
every
hill
for
a
fresh
prospect
he
turned
aside
to
every
cascade
and
pleased
himself
with
tracing
the
course
of
a
gentle
river
that
rolled
among
the
trees
and
watered
a
large
region
with
innumerable
circumvolutions
in
these
amusements
the
hours
passed
away
uncounted
his
deviations
had
perplexed
his
memory
and
he
knew
not
toward
what
point
to
travel
he
stood
pensive
and
confused
afraid
to
go
forward
lest
he
should
go
wrong
yet
conscious
that
the
time
of
loitering
was
now
past
while
he
was
thus
tortured
with
uncertainty
the
sky
was
overspread
with
clouds
the
day
vanished
from
before
him
and
a
sudden
tempest
gathered
round
his
head
he
was
now
roused
by
his
danger
to
a
quick
and
painful
remembrance
of
his
folly
he
now
saw
how
happiness
is
lost
when
ease
is
consulted
he
lamented
the
unmanly
impatience
that
prompted
him
to
seek
shelter
in
the
grove
and
despised
the
petty
curiosity
that
led
him
on
from
trifle
to
trifle
while
he
was
thus
reflecting
the
air
grew
blacker
and
a
clap
of
thunder
broke
his
meditation
he
now
resolved
to
do
what
remained
yet
in
his
power
to
tread
back
the
ground
which
he
had
passed
and
try
to
find
some
issue
where
the
wood
might
open
into
the
plain
he
prostrated
himself
upon
the
ground
and
commended
his
life
to
the
lord
of
nature
he
rose
with
confidence
and
tranquillity
and
pressed
on
with
his
saber
in
his
hand
for
the
beasts
of
the
desert
were
in
motion
and
on
every
hand
were
heard
the
mingled
howls
of
rage
and
fear
and
ravage
and
expiration
all
the
horrors
of
darkness
and
solitude
surrounded
him
the
winds
roared
in
the
woods
and
the
torrents
tumbled
from
the
hills
thus
forlorn
and
distressed
he
wandered
through
the
wild
without
knowing
whither
he
was
going
or
whether
he
was
every
moment
drawing
nearer
to
safety
or
to
destruction
at
length
not
fear
but
labor
began
to
overcome
him
his
breath
grew
short
and
his
knees
trembled
and
he
was
on
the
point
of
lying
down
in
resignation
to
his
fate
when
he
beheld
through
the
brambles
the
glimmer
of
a
taper
he
advanced
toward
the
light
and
finding
that
it
proceeded
from
the
cottage
of
a
hermit
he
called
humbly
at
the
door
and
obtained
admission
the
old
man
set
before
him
such
provisions
as
he
had
collected
for
himself
on
which
obidah
fed
with
eagerness
and
gratitude
when
the
repast
was
over
tell
me
said

hermit
by
what
chance
thou
hast
been
brought
hither
i
have
been
now
twenty

the
errors
and
follies
the
dangers
and
escapes
of
this
day
sink
deep
into
your
heart
remember
my
son
that
human
life
is
the
journey
of
a
day
we
rise
in
the
morning
of
youth
full
of
vigor
and
full
of
expectation
we
set
forward
with
spirit
and
hope
with
gayety
and
with
diligence
and
travel
on
awhile
in
the
straight
road
of
piety
toward
the
mansions
of
rest
in
a
short
time
we
remit
our
fervor
and
endeavor
to
find
some
mitigation
of
our
duty
and
some
more
easy
means
of
obtaining
the
same
end
we
then
relax
our
vigor
and
resolve
no
longer
to
be
terrified
with
crimes
at
a
distance
but
rely
upon
our
own
constancy
and
venture
to
approach
what
we
resolve
never
to
touch
we
thus
enter
the
bowers
of
ease
and
repose
in
the
shades
of
security
here
the
heart
softens
and
vigilance
subsides
we
are
then
willing
to
inquire
whether
another
advance
can
not
be
made
and
whether
we
may
not
at
least
turn
our
eyes
upon
the
gardens
of
pleasure
we
approach
them
with
scruple
and
hesitation
we
enter
them
but
enter
timorous
and
trembling
and
always
hope
to
pass
through
them
without
losing
the
road
of
virtue
which
we
for
a
while
keep
in
our
sight
and
to
which
we
propose
to
return
but
temptation
succeeds
temptation
and
one
compliance
prepares
us
for
another
we
in
time
lose
the
happiness
of
innocence
and
solace
our
disquiet
with
sensual
gratifications
by
degrees
we
let
fall
the
remembrance
of
our
original
intention
and
quit
the
only
adequate
object
of
rational
desire
we
entangle
ourselves
in
business
immerge
ourselves
in
luxury
and
rove
through
the
labyrinths
of
inconstancy
till
the
darkness
of
old
age
begins
to
invade
us
and
disease
and
anxiety
obstruct
our
way
we
then
look
back
upon
our
lives
with
horror
with
sorrow
and
with
repentance
and
wish
but
too
often
vainly
wish
that
we
had
not
forsaken
the
paths
of
virtue
happy
are
they
my
son
who
shall
learn
from
thy
example
not
to
despair
but
shall
remember
that
though
the
day
is
past
and
their
strength
is
wasted
there
yet
remains
one
effort
to
be
made
that
reformation
is
never
hopeless
nor
sincere
endeavors
ever
unassisted
that
the
wanderer
may
at
length
return
after
all
his
errors
and
that
he
who
implores
strength
and
courage
from
above
shall
find
danger
and
difficulty
give
way
before
him
go
now
my
son
to
thy
repose
commit
thyself
to
the
care
of
omnipotence
and
when
the
morning
calls
again
to
toil
begin
anew
thy
journey
and

thomas

b
this
eminent
lawyer
and
scholar
was
born
in
charleston
he
graduated
at
yale
college
in
he
gained
considerable
reputation
as
a
politician
but
is
best
known
as
an
advocate
of

he
was
a
man
of
deep
feeling
earnest
purpose
and
pure
life
there
is
a
classic
the
best
the
world
has
ever
seen
the
noblest
that
has
ever
honored
and
dignified
the
language
of
mortals
if
we
look
into
its
antiquity
we
discover
a
title
to
our
veneration
unrivaled
in
the
history
of
literature
if
we
have
respect
to
its
evidences
they
are
found
in
the
testimony
of
miracle
and
prophecy
in
the
ministry
of
man
of
nature
and
of
angels
yea
even
of
god
manifest
in
the
flesh
of
god
blessed
forever
if
we
consider
its
authenticity
no
other
pages
have
survived
the
lapse
of
time
that
can
be
compared
with
it
if
we
examine
its
authority
for
it
speaks
as
never
man
spake
we
discover
that
it
came
from
heaven
in
vision
and
prophecy
under
the
sanction
of
him
who
is
creator
of
all
things
and
the
giver
of
every
good
and
perfect
gift
if
we
reflect
on
its
truths
they
are
lovely
and
spotless
sublime
and
holy
as
god
himself
unchangeable
as
his
nature
durable
as
his
righteous
dominion
and
versatile
as
the
moral
condition
of
mankind
if
we
regard
the
value
of
its
treasures
we
must
estimate
them
not
like
the
relics
of
classic
antiquity
by
the
perishable
glory
and
beauty
virtue
and
happiness
of
this
world
but
by
the
enduring
perfection
and
supreme
felicity
of
an
eternal
kingdom
if
we
inquire
who
are
the
men
that
have
recorded
its
truths
vindicated
its
rights
and
illustrated
the
excellence
of
its
scheme
from
the
depth
of
ages
and
from
the
living
world
from
the
populous
continent
and
the
isles
of
the
sea
comes
forth
the
answer
the
patriarch
and
the
prophet
the
evangelist
and
the
martyr
if
we
look
abroad
through
the
world
of
men
the
victims
of
folly
or
vice
the
prey
of
cruelty
of
injustice
and
inquire
what
are
its
benefits
even
in
this
temporal
state
the
great
and
the
humble
the
rich
and
the
poor
the
powerful
and
the
weak
the
learned
and
the
ignorant
reply
as
with
one
voice
that
humility
and
resignation
purity
order
and
peace
faith
hope
and
charity
are
its
blessings
upon
earth
and
if
raising
our
eyes
from
time
to
eternity
from
the
world
of
mortals
to
the
world
of
just
men
made
perfect
from
the
visible
creation
marvelous
beautiful
and
glorious
as
it
is
to
the
invisible
creation
of
angels
and
seraphs
from
the
footstool
of
god
to
the
throne
of
god
himself
we
ask
what
are
the
blessings
that
flow
from
this
single
volume
let
the
question
be
answered
by
the
pen
of
the
evangelist
the
harp
of
the
prophet
and
the
records
of
the
book
of
life
such

the

of

the
