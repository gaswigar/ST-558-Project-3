history
of
the

of
a
musician
of
genius
the
present
volume
comprises
the
first
four
volumes
of
the
original
french
viz
le
matin
and
la
révólte
which
are
designated
in
the
translation
as
part
i
the
dawn
part
ii
morning
part
iii
youth
part
iv
revolt
parts
i
and
ii
carry
from
the
moment
of
his
birth
to
the
day
when
after
his
first
encounter
with
woman
at
the
age
of
fifteen
he
falls
back
upon
a
puritan
creed
parts
iii
and
iv
describe
the
succeeding
five
years
of
his
life
when
at
the
age
of
twenty
his
sincerity
integrity
and
unswerving
honesty
have
made
existence
impossible
for
him
in
the
little
rhine
town
of
his
birth
an
act
of
open
revolt
against
german
militarism
compels
him
to
cross
the
frontier
and
take
refuge
in
paris
and
the
remainder
of
this
vast
book
is
devoted
to
the
adventures
of
in
france
his
creator
has
said
that
he
has
always
conceived
and
thought
of
the
life
of
his
hero
and
of
the
book
as
a
river
so
far
as
the
book
has
a
plan
that
is
its
plan
it
has
no
literary
artifice
no
plot
the
words
of
it
hang
together
in
defiance
of
syntax
just
as
the
thoughts
of
it
follow
one
on
the
other
in
defiance
of
every
system
of
philosophy
every
phase
of
the
book
is
pregnant
with
the
next
phase
it
is
as
direct
and
simple
as
life
itself
for
life
is
simple
when
the
truth
of
it
is
known
as
it
was
known
instinctively
by
the
river
is
explored
as
though
it
were
absolutely
uncharted
nothing
that
has
ever
been
said
or
thought
of
life
is
accepted
without
being
brought
to
the
test
of
own
life
what
is
not
true
for
him
does
not
exist
and
as
there
are
very
few
of
the
processes
of
human
growth
or
decay
which
are
not
analysed
there
is
disclosed
to
the
reader
the
most
comprehensive
survey
of
modern
life
which
has
appeared
in
literature
in
this
century
to
leave
rolland
simile
of
the
river
and
to
take
another
the
book
has
seemed
to
me
like
a
mighty
bridge
leading
from
the
world
of
ideas
of
the
nineteenth
century
to
the
world
of
ideas
of
the
twentieth
the
whole
thought
of
the
nineteenth
century
seems
to
be
gathered
together
to
make
the
for
leap
into
the
future
all
that
was
most
religious
in
that
thought
seems
to
be
concentrated
in
and
when
the
history
of
the
book
is
traced
it
appears
that
rolland
has
it
by
direct
inheritance
rolland
was
born
in
at
clamecy
in
the
center
of
france
of
a
french
family
of
pure
descent
and
educated
in
paris
and
rome
at
rome
in
he
met
malwida
von
meysenburg
a
german
lady
who
had
taken
refuge
in
england
after
the
revolution
of
and
there
knew
kossuth
mazzini
herzen
ledin
rollin
and
louis
blanc
later
in
italy
she
counted
among
her
friends
wagner
liszt
lenbach
nietzsche
garibaldi
and
ibsen
she
died
in
rolland
came
to
her
impregnated
with
tolstoyan
ideas
and
with
her
wide
knowledge
of
men
and
movements
she
helped
him
to
discover
his
own
ideas
in
her
mémoires
idéaliste
she
wrote
of
him
in
this
young
frenchman
i
discovered
the
same
idealism
the
same
lofty
aspiration
the
same
profound
grasp
of
every
great
intellectual
manifestation
that
i
had
already
found
in
the
greatest
men
of
other
nationalities
the
germ
of
was
conceived
during
this
period
the
wanderjahre
of
rolland
life
on
his
return
to
paris
he
became
associated
with
a
movement
towards
the
renascence
of
the
theater
as
a
social
machine
and
wrote
several
plays
he
has
since
been
a
musical
critic
and
a
lecturer
on
music
and
art
at
the
sorbonne
he
has
written
lives
of
beethoven
michael
angelo
and
hugo
wolf
always
his
endeavor
has
been
the
pursuit
of
the
heroic
to
him
the
great
men
are
the
men
of
absolute
truth
must
have
the
truth
and
tell
the
truth
at
all
costs
in
despite
of
circumstance
in
despite
of
himself
in
despite
even
of
life
it
is
his
law
it
is
rolland
law
the
struggle
all
through
the
book
is
between
the
pure
life
of
and
the
common
acceptance
of
the
and
the
by
the
substitution
of
civic
or
social
morality
which
is
only
a
compromise
for
individual
morality
which
demands
that
every
man
should
be
delivered
up
to
the
unswerving
judgment
of
his
own
soul
everywhere
is
hurled
against
compromise
and
untruth
individual
and
national
he
discovers
the
german
lie
very
quickly
the
french
lie
grimaces
at
him
as
soon
as
he
sets
foot
in
paris
the
book
itself
breaks
down
the
frontier
between
france
and
germany
if
one
frontier
is
broken
all
are
broken
the
truth
about
anything
is
universal
truth
and
the
experiences
of
the
adventures
of
his
soul
there
are
no
other
adventures
are
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
those
of
every
human
being
who
passes
through
this
life
from
the
tyranny
of
the
past
to
the
service
of
the
future
the
book
contains
a
host
of
characters
who
become
as
friends
or
at
least
as
interesting
neighbors
to
the
reader
gathers
people
in
his
progress
and
as
they
are
all
brought
to
the
test
of
his
genius
they
appear
clearly
for
what
they
are
even
the
most
unpleasant
of
them
is
human
and
demands
sympathy
the
recognition
of
as
a
book
which
marks
a
stage
in
progress
was
instantaneous
in
france
it
is
hardly
possible
yet
to
judge
it
it
is
impossible
to
deny
its
vitality
it
exists
christophe
is
as
real
as
the
gentlemen
whose
portraits
are
posted
outside
the
queen
hall
and
much
more
real
than
many
of
them
the
book
clears
the
air
an
open
mind
coming
to
it
can
not
fail
to
be
refreshed
and
strengthened
by
its
voyage
down
the
river
of
a
man
life
and
if
the
book
is
followed
to
its
end
the
voyager
will
discover
with
christophe
that
there
is
joy
beneath
sorrow
joy
through
sorrow
durch
leiden
freude
those
are
the
last
words
of
rolland
life
of
beethoven
they
are
words
of
beethoven
himself
la
devise
de
tout
âme
héroïque
in
his
preface
to
the
friends
of
christophe
which
precedes
the
seventh
volume
dans
la
maison
rolland
writes
i
was
isolated
like
so
many
others
in
france
i
was
stifling
in
a
world
morally
inimical
to
me
i
wanted
air
i
wanted
to
react
against
an
unhealthy
civilization
against
ideas
corrupted
by
a
sham
élite
i
wanted
to
say
to
them
lie
you
do
not
represent
france
to
do
so
i
needed
a
hero
with
a
pure
heart
and
unclouded
vision
whose
soul
would
be
stainless
enough
for
him
to
have
the
right
to
speak
one
whose
voice
would
be
loud
enough
for
him
to
gain
a
hearing
i
have
patiently
begotten
this
hero
the
work
was
in
conception
for
many
years
before
i
set
myself
to
write
a
word
of
it
christophe
only
set
out
on
his
journey
when
i
had
been
able
to
see
the
end
of
it
for
him
if
rolland
act
of
faith
in
writing
were
only
concerned
with
france
if
the
polemic
of
it
were
not
directed
against
a
universal
evil
there
would
be
no
reason
for
translation
but
like
zarathustra
it
is
a
book
for
all
and
none
rolland
has
written
what
he
believes
to
be
the
truth
and
as
johnson
observed
every
man
has
a
right
to
utter
what
he
thinks
truth
and
every
other
man
has
a
right
to
knock
him
down
for
it
by
its
truth
and
its
absolute
integrity
since
tolstoy
i
know
of
no
writing
so
crystal
clear
is
the
first
great
book
of
the
twentieth
century
in
a
sense
it
begins
the
twentieth
century
it
bridges
transition
and
shows
us
where
we
stand
it
reveals
the
past
and
the
present
and
leaves
the
future
open
to
us

from
behind
the
house
rises
the
murmuring
of
the
river
all
day
long
the
rain
has
been
beating
against
the
a
stream
of
water
trickles
down
the
window
at
the
corner
where
it
is
broken
the
yellowish
light
of
the
day
dies
down
the
room
is
dim
and
dull
the
child
stirs
in
his
cradle
although
the
old
man
left
his
sabots
at
the
door
when
he
entered
his
footsteps
make
the
floor
creak
the
child
begins
to
whine
the
mother
leans
out
of
her
bed
to
comfort
it
and
the
grandfather
gropes
to
light
the
lamp
so
that
the
child
shall
not
be
frightened
by
the
night
when
he
awakes
the
flame
of
the
lamp
lights
up
old
jean
michel
red
face
with
its
rough
white
beard
and
morose
expression
and
quick
eyes
he
goes
near
the
cradle
his
cloak
smells
wet
and
as
he
walks
he
drags
his
large
blue
list
slippers
louisa
signs
to
him
not
to
go
too
near
she
is
fair
almost
white
her
features
are
drawn
her
gentle
stupid
face
is
marked
with
red
in
patches
her
lips
are
pale
and
swollen
and
they
are
parted
in
a
timid
smile
her
eyes
devour
the
child
and
her
eyes
are
blue
and
vague
the
pupils
are
small
but
there
is
an
infinite
tenderness
in
them
the
child
wakes
and
cries
and
his
eyes
are
troubled
oh
how
terrible
the
darkness
the
sudden
flash
of
the
lamp
the
hallucinations
of
a
mind
as
yet
hardly
detached
from
chaos
the
stifling
roaring
night
in
which
it
is
enveloped
the
illimitable
gloom
from
which
like
blinding
shafts
of
light
there
emerge
acute
sensations
sorrows
phantoms
those
enormous
faces
leaning
over
him
those
eyes
that
pierce
through
him
penetrating
are
beyond
his
comprehension
he
has
not
the
strength
to
cry
out
terror
holds
him
motionless
with
eyes
and
mouth
wide
open
and
he
rattles
in
his
throat
his
large
head
that
seems
to
have
swollen
up
is
wrinkled
with
the
grotesque
and
lamentable
grimaces
that
he
makes
the
skin
of
his
face
and
hands
is
brown
and
purple
and
spotted
with
yellow
dear
god
said
the
old
man
with
conviction
how
ugly
he
is
he
put
the
lamp
down
on
the
table
louisa
pouted
like
a
scolded
child
jean
michel
looked
at
her
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
and
laughed
you
do
want
me
to
say
that
he
is
beautiful
you
would
not
believe
it
come
it
is
not
your
fault
they
are
all
like
that
the
child
came
out
of
the
stupor
and
immobility
into
which
he
had
been
thrown
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
and
the
eyes
of
the
old
man
he
began
to
cry
perhaps
he
instinctively
felt
in
his
mother
eyes
a
caress
which
made
it
possible
for
him
to
complain
she
held
out
her
arms
for
him
and
said
give
him
to
me
the
old
man
began
as
usual
to
air
his
theories
you
ought
not
to
give
way
to
children
when
they
cry
you
must
just
let
them
cry
but
he
came
and
took
the
child
and
grumbled
i
never
saw
one
quite
so
ugly
louisa
took
the
child
feverishly
and
pressed
it
to
her
bosom
she
looked
at
it
with
a
bashful
and
delighted
smile
oh
my
poor
child
she
said
shamefacedly
how
ugly
you
are
how
ugly
and
how
i
love
you
jean
michel
went
back
to
the
fireside
he
began
to
poke
the
fire
in
protest
but
a
smile
gave
the
lie
to
the
moroseness
and
solemnity
of
his
expression
good
girl
he
said
do
worry
about
it
he
has
plenty
of
time
to
alter
and
even
so
what
does
it
matter
only
one
thing
is
asked
of
him
that
he
should
grow
into
an
honest
man
the
child
was
comforted
by
contact
with
his
mother
warm
body
he
could
be
heard
sucking
her
milk
and
gurgling
and
snorting
jean
michel
turned
in
his
chair
and
said
once
more
with
some
emphasis
there
nothing
finer
than
an
honest
man
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
pondering
whether
it
would
not
be
proper
to
elaborate
this
thought
but
he
found
nothing
more
to
say
and
after
a
silence
he
said
irritably
why
is
your
husband
here
i
think
he
is
at
the
theater
said
louisa
timidly
there
is
a
rehearsal
the
theater
is
closed
i
passed
it
just
now
one
of
his
lies
no
do
be
always
blaming
him
i
must
have
misunderstood
he
must
have
been
kept
for
one
of
his
lessons
he
ought
to
have
come
back
said
the
old
man
not
satisfied
he
stopped
for
a
moment
and
then
asked
in
a
rather
lower
voice
and
with
some
shame
has
he
been
again
no
father
no
father
said
louisa
hurriedly
the
old
man
looked
at
her
she
avoided
his
eyes
it
not
true
you
lying
she
wept
in
silence
dear
god
said
the
old
man
kicking
at
the
fire
with
his
foot
the
poker
fell
with
a
clatter
the
mother
and
the
child
trembled
father
please
please
said
louisa
you
will
make
him
cry
the
child
hesitated
for
a
second
or
two
whether
to
cry
or
to
go
on
with
his
meal
but
not
being
able
to
do
both
at
once
he
went
on
with
the
meal
jean
michel
continued
in
a
lower
tone
though
with
outbursts
of
anger
what
have
i
done
to
the
good
god
to
have
this
drunkard
for
my
son
what
is
the
use
of
my
having
lived
as
i
have
lived
and
of
having
denied
myself
everything
all
my
life
but
you
you
ca
you
do
anything
to
stop
it
heavens
that
what
you
ought
to
do
you
should
keep
him
at
home
louisa
wept
still
more
do
scold
me
i
am
unhappy
enough
as
it
is
i
have
done
everything
i
could
if
you
knew
how
terrified
i
am
when
i
am
alone
always
i
seem
to
hear
his
step
on
the
stairs
then
i
wait
for
the
door
to
open
or
i
ask
myself
god
what
will
he
look
like
it
makes
me
ill
to
think
of
it
she
was
shaken
by
her
sobs
the
old
man
grew
anxious
he
went
to
her
and
laid
the
disheveled
bedclothes
about
her
trembling
shoulders
and
caressed
her
head
with
his
hands
come
come
do
be
afraid
i
am
here
she
calmed
herself
for
the
child
sake
and
tried
to
smile
i
was
wrong
to
tell
you
that
the
old
man
shook
his
head
as
he
looked
at
her
my
poor
child
it
was
not
much
of
a
present
that
i
gave
you
it
my
own
fault
she
said
he
ought
not
to
have
married
me
he
is
sorry
for
what
he
did
what
do
you
mean
that
he
regrets
you
know
you
were
angry
yourself
because
i
became
his
wife
we
wo
talk
about
that
it
is
true
i
was
vexed
a
young
man
like
that
i
can
say
so
without
hurting
you
a
young
man
whom
i
had
carefully
brought
up
a
distinguished
musician
a
real
artist
might
have
looked
higher
than
you
who
had
nothing
and
were
of
a
lower
class
and
not
even
of
the
same
trade
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
no
krafft
has
ever
married
a
woman
who
was
not
a
musician
but
you
know
i
bear
you
no
grudge
and
am
fond
of
you
and
have
been
ever
since
i
learned
to
know
you
besides
there
no
going
back
on
a
choice
once
it
made
there
nothing
left
but
to
do
duty
honestly
he
went
and
sat
down
again
thought
for
a
little
and
then
said
with
the
solemnity
in
which
he
invested
all
his
aphorisms
the
first
thing
in
life
is
to
do
one
duty
he
waited
for
contradiction
and
spat
on
the
fire
then
as
neither
mother
nor
child
raised
any
objection
he
was
for
going
on
but
relapsed
into
silence
they
said
no
more
both
jean
michel
sitting
by
the
fireside
and
louisa
in
her
bed
dreamed
sadly
the
old
man
in
spite
of
what
he
had
said
had
bitter
thoughts
about
his
son
marriage
and
louisa
was
thinking
of
it
also
and
blaming
herself
although
she
had
nothing
wherewith
to
reproach
herself
she
had
been
a
servant
when
to
everybody
surprise
and
her
own
especially
she
married
melchior
krafft
jean
michel
son
the
kraffts
were
without
fortune
but
were
considerable
people
in
the
little
rhine
town
in
which
the
old
man
had
settled
down
more
than
fifty
years
before
both
father
and
son
were
musicians
and
known
to
all
the
musicians
of
the
country
from
cologne
to
mannheim
melchior
played
the
violin
at
the
and
jean
michel
had
formerly
been
director
of
the
concerts
the
old
man
had
been
profoundly
humiliated
by
his
son
marriage
for
he
had
built
great
hopes
upon
melchior
he
had
wished
to
make
him
the
distinguished
man
which
he
had
failed
to
become
himself
this
mad
freak
destroyed
all
his
ambitions
he
had
stormed
at
first
and
showered
curses
upon
melchior
and
louisa
but
being
a
creature
he
forgave
his
when
he
learned
to
know
her
better
and
he
even
came
by
a
paternal
affection
for
her
which
showed
itself
for
the
most
part
in
snubs
no
one
ever
understood
what
it
was
that
drove
melchior
to
such
a
marriage
least
of
all
melchior
it
was
certainly
not
louisa
beauty
she
had
no
seductive
quality
she
was
small
rather
pale
and
delicate
and
she
was
a
striking
contrast
to
melchior
and
jean
michel
who
were
both
big
and
broad
giants
hearty
eaters
and
drinkers
and
noisy
she
seemed
to
be
crushed
by
them
no
one
noticed
her
and
she
seemed
to
wish
to
escape
even
what
little
notice
she
attracted
if
melchior
had
been
a
man
it
would
have
been
credible
that
he
should
prefer
louisa
simple
goodness
to
every
other
advantage
but
a
vainer
man
never
was
it
seemed
incredible
that
a
young
man
of
his
kidney
fairly
and
quite
conscious
of
it
very
foolish
but
not
without
talent
and
in
a
position
to
look
for
some
match
and
capable
even
who
knows
of
turning
the
head
of
one
of
his
pupils
among
the
people
of
the
town
should
suddenly
have
chosen
a
girl
of
the
people
poor
uneducated
without
beauty
a
girl
who
could
in
no
way
advance
his
career
but
melchior
was
one
of
those
men
who
always
do
the
opposite
of
what
is
expected
of
them
and
of
what
they
expect
of
themselves
it
is
not
that
they
are
not
warned
a
man
who
is
warned
is
worth
two
men
says
the
proverb
they
profess
never
to
be
the
dupe
of
anything
and
that
they
steer
their
ship
with
unerring
hand
towards
a
definite
point
but
they
reckon
without
themselves
for
they
do
not
know
themselves
in
one
of
those
moments
of
forgetfulness
which
are
habitual
with
them
they
let
go
the
tiller
and
as
is
natural
when
things
are
left
to
themselves
they
take
a
naughty
pleasure
in
rounding
on
their
masters
the
ship
which
is
released
from
its
course
at
once
strikes
a
rock
and
melchior
bent
upon
intrigue
married
a
cook
and
yet
he
was
neither
drunk
nor
in
a
stupor
on
the
day
when
he
bound
himself
to
her
for
life
and
he
was
not
under
any
passionate
impulse
far
from
it
but
perhaps
there
are
in
us
forces
other
than
mind
and
heart
other
even
than
the
senses
mysterious
forces
which
take
hold
of
us
in
the
moments
when
the
others
are
asleep
and
perhaps
it
was
such
forces
that
melchior
had
found
in
the
depths
of
those
pale
eyes
which
had
looked
at
him
so
timidly
one
evening
when
he
had
accosted
the
girl
on
the
bank
of
the
river
and
had
sat
down
beside
her
in
the
reeds
without
knowing
why
and
had
given
her
his
hand
hardly
was
he
married
than
he
was
appalled
by
what
he
had
done
and
he
did
not
hide
what
he
felt
from
poor
louisa
who
humbly
asked
his
pardon
he
was
not
a
bad
fellow
and
he
willingly
granted
her
that
but
immediately
remorse
would
seize
him
again
when
he
was
with
his
friends
or
in
the
houses
of
his
rich
pupils
who
were
disdainful
in
their
treatment
of
him
and
no
longer
trembled
at
the
touch
of
his
hand
when
he
corrected
the
position
of
their
fingers
on
the
keyboard
then
he
would
return
gloomy
of
countenance
and
louisa
with
a
catch
at
her
heart
would
read
in
it
with
the
first
glance
the
customary
reproach
or
he
would
stay
out
late
at
one
inn
or
another
there
to
seek
or
kindliness
from
others
on
such
evenings
he
would
return
shouting
with
laughter
and
this
was
more
doleful
for
louisa
than
the
hidden
reproach
and
gloomy
rancor
that
prevailed
on
other
days
she
felt
that
she
was
to
a
certain
extent
responsible
for
the
fits
of
madness
in
which
the
small
remnant
of
her
husband
sense
would
disappear
together
with
the
household
money
melchior
sank
lower
and
lower
at
an
age
when
he
should
have
been
engaged
in
unceasing
toil
to
develop
his
mediocre
talent
he
just
let
things
slide
and
others
took
his
place
but
what
did
that
matter
to
the
unknown
force
which
had
thrown
him
in
with
the
little
servant
he
had
played
his
part
and
little
had
just
set
foot
on
this
earth
whither
his
destiny
had
thrust
him
night
was
fully
come
louisa
voice
roused
old
jean
michel
from
the
torpor
into
which
he
had
sunk
by
the
fireside
as
he
thought
of
the
sorrows
of
the
past
and
present
it
must
be
late
father
said
the
young
woman
affectionately
you
ought
to
go
home
you
have
far
to
go
i
am
waiting
for
melchior
replied
the
old
man
please
no
i
would
rather
you
did
not
stay
why
the
old
man
raised
his
head
and
looked
fiercely
at
her
she
did
not
reply
he
resumed
you
are
afraid
you
do
not
want
me
to
meet
him
yes
yes
it
would
only
make
things
worse
you
would
make
each
other
angry
and
i
do
want
that
please
please
go
the
old
man
sighed
rose
and
said
well
i
go
he
went
to
her
and
brushed
her
forehead
with
his
stiff
beard
he
asked
if
she
wanted
anything
put
out
the
lamp
and
went
stumbling
against
the
chairs
in
the
darkness
of
the
room
but
he
had
no
sooner
reached
the
staircase
than
he
thought
of
his
son
returning
drunk
and
he
stopped
at
each
step
imagining
a
thousand
dangers
that
might
arise
if
melchior
were
allowed
to
return
alone
in
the
bed
by
his
mother
side
the
child
was
stirring
again
an
unknown
sorrow
had
arisen
from
the
depths
of
his
being
he
stiffened
himself
against
her
he
twisted
his
body
clenched
his
fists
and
knitted
his
brows
his
suffering
increased
steadily
quietly
certain
of
its
strength
he
knew
not
what
it
was
nor
whence
it
came
it
appeared
immense
infinite
and
he
began
to
cry
lamentably
his
mother
caressed
him
with
her
gentle
hands
already
his
suffering
was
less
acute
but
he
went
on
weeping
for
he
felt
it
still
near
still
inside
himself
a
man
who
suffers
can
lessen
his
anguish
by
knowing
whence
it
comes
by
thought
he
can
locate
it
in
a
certain
portion
of
his
body
which
can
be
cured
or
if
necessary
torn
away
he
fixes
the
bounds
of
it
and
separates
it
from
himself
a
child
has
no
such
illusive
resource
his
first
encounter
with
suffering
is
more
tragic
and
more
true
like
his
own
being
it
seems
infinite
he
feels
that
it
is
seated
in
his
bosom
housed
in
his
heart
and
is
mistress
of
his
flesh
and
it
is
so
it
will
not
leave
his
body
until
it
has
eaten
it
away
his
mother
hugs
him
to
her
murmuring
it
is
done
it
is
done
cry
my
little
jesus
my
little
goldfish
but
his
intermittent
outcry
continues
it
is
as
though
this
wretched
unformed
and
unconscious
mass
had
a
presentiment
of
a
whole
life
of
sorrow
awaiting
him
and
nothing
can
appease
him
the
bells
of
martin
rang
out
in
the
night
their
voices
are
solemn
and
slow
in
the
damp
air
they
come
like
footsteps
on
moss
the
child
became
silent
in
the
middle
of
a
sob
the
marvelous
music
like
a
flood
of
milk
surged
sweetly
through
him
the
night
was
lit
up
the
air
was
moist
and
tender
his
sorrow
disappeared
his
heart
began
to
laugh
and
he
slid
into
his
dreams
with
a
sigh
of
abandonment
the
three
bells
went
on
softly
ringing
in
the
morrow
festival
louisa
also
dreamed
as
she
listened
to
them
of
her
own
past
misery
and
of
what
would
become
in
the
future
of
the
dear
little
child
sleeping
by
her
side
she
had
been
for
hours
lying
in
her
bed
weary
and
suffering
her
hands
and
her
body
were
burning
the
heavy
eiderdown
crushed
her
she
felt
crushed
and
oppressed
by
the
darkness
but
she
dared
not
move
she
looked
at
the
child
and
the
night
did
not
prevent
her
reading
his
features
that
looked
so
old
sleep
overcame
her
fevered
images
passed
through
her
brain
she
thought
she
heard
melchior
open
the
door
and
her
heart
leaped
occasionally
the
murmuring
of
the
stream
rose
more
loudly
through
the
silence
like
the
roaring
of
some
beast
the
window
once
or
twice
gave
a
sound
under
the
beating
of
the
rain
the
bells
rang
out
more
slowly
and
then
died
down
and
louisa
slept
by
the
side
of
her
child
all
this
time
jean
michel
was
waiting
outside
the
house
dripping
with
rain
his
beard
wet
with
the
mist
he
was
waiting
for
the
return
of
his
wretched
son
for
his
mind
never
ceasing
had
insisted
on
telling
him
all
sorts
of
tragedies
brought
about
by
drunkenness
and
although
he
did
not
believe
them
he
could
not
hate
slept
a
wink
if
he
had
gone
away
without
having
seen
his
son
return
the
sound
of
the
bells
made
him
melancholy
for
he
remembered
all
his
shattered
hopes
he
thought
of
what
he
was
doing
at
such
an
hour
in
the
street
and
for
very
shame
he
wept
the
vast
tide
of
the
days
moves
slowly
day
and
night
come
up
and
go
down
with
unfailing
regularity
like
the
ebb
and
low
of
an
infinite
ocean
weeks
and
months
go
by
and
then
begin
again
and
the
succession
of
days
is
like
one
day
the
day
is
immense
inscrutable
marking
the
even
beat
of
light
and
darkness
and
the
beat
of
the
life
of
the
torpid
creature
dreaming
in
the
depths
of
his
cradle
his
imperious
needs
sorrowful
or
glad
so
regular
that
the
night
and
the
day
which
bring
them
seem
by
them
to
be
brought
about
the
pendulum
of
life
moves
heavily
and
in
its
slow
beat
the
whole
creature
seems
to
be
absorbed
the
rest
is
no
more
than
dreams
snatches
of
dreams
formless
and
swarming
and
dust
of
atoms
dancing
aimlessly
a
dizzy
whirl
passing
and
bringing
laughter
or
horror
outcry
moving
shadows
grinning
shapes
sorrows
terrors
laughter
dreams
dreams
all
is
a
dream
both
day
and
night
and
in
such
chaos
the
light
of
friendly
eyes
that
smile
upon
him
the
flood
of
joy
that
surges
through
his
body
from
his
body
from
her
breasts
filled
with
milk
the
force
that
is
in
him
the
immense
unconscious
force
gathering
in
him
the
turbulent
ocean
roaring
in
the
narrow
prison
of
the
child
body
for
eyes
that
could
see
into
it
there
would
be
revealed
whole
worlds
half
buried
in
the
darkness
nebulæ
taking
shape
a
universe
in
the
making
his
being
is
limitless
he
is
all
that
there
is
months
pass
islands
of
memory
begin
to
rise
above
the
river
of
his
life
at
first
they
are
little
uncharted
islands
rocks
just
peeping
above
the
surface
of
the
waters
round
about
them
and
behind
in
the
twilight
of
the
dawn
stretches
the
great
untroubled
sheet
of
water
then
new
islands
touched
to
gold
by
the
sun
so
from
the
abyss
of
the
soul
there
emerge
shapes
definite
and
scenes
of
a
strange
clarity
in
the
boundless
day
which
dawns
once
more
ever
the
same
with
its
great
monotonous
beat
there
begins
to
show
forth
the
round
of
days
hand
in
hand
and
some
of
their
forms
are
smiling
others
sad
but
ever
the
links
of
the
chain
are
broken
and
memories
are
linked
together
above
weeks
and
months
the
river
the
bells
as
long
as
he
can
remember
far
back
in
the
abysses
of
time
at
every
hour
of
his
life
always
their
voices
familiar
and
resonant
have
rung
out
night
half
asleep
a
pale
light
made
white
the
window
the
river
murmurs
through
the
silence
its
voice
rises
omnipotent
it
reigns
over
all
creatures
sometimes
it
caresses
their
sleep
and
seems
almost
itself
to
die
away
in
the
roaring
of
its
torrent
sometimes
it
grows
angry
and
howls
like
a
furious
beast
about
to
bite
the
clamor
ceases
now
there
is
a
murmuring
of
infinite
tenderness
silvery
sounds
like
clear
little
bells
like
the
laughter
of
children
or
soft
singing
voices
or
dancing
music
a
great
mother
voice
that
never
never
goes
to
sleep
it
rocks
the
child
as
it
has
rocked
through
the
ages
from
birth
to
death
the
generations
that
were
before
him
it
fills
all
his
thoughts
and
lives
in
all
his
dreams
wraps
him
round
with
the
cloak
of
its
fluid
harmonies
which
still
will
be
about
him
when
he
lies
in
the
little
cemetery
that
sleeps
by
the
edge
washed
by
the
rhine
the
bells
it
is
dawn
they
answer
each
other
call
sad
melancholy
friendly
gentle
at
the
sound
of
their
slow
voices
there
rise
in
him
hosts
of
dreams
dreams
of
the
past
desires
hopes
regrets
for
creatures
who
are
gone
unknown
to
the
child
although
he
had
his
being
in
them
and
they
live
again
in
him
ages
of
memory
ring
out
in
that
music
so
much
mourning
so
many
festivals
and
from
the
depths
of
the
room
it
is
as
though
when
they
are
heard
there
passed
lovely
waves
of
sound
through
the
soft
air
free
winging
birds
and
the
moist
soughing
of
the
wind
through
the
window
smiles
a
patch
of
blue
sky
a
sunbeam
slips
through
the
curtains
to
the
bed
the
little
world
known
to
the
eyes
of
the
child
all
that
he
can
see
from
his
bed
every
morning
as
he
awakes
all
that
with
so
much
effort
he
is
beginning
to
recognize
and
classify
so
that
he
may
be
master
of
it
his
kingdom
is
lit
up
there
is
the
table
where
people
eat
the
cupboard
where
he
hides
to
play
the
tiled
floor
along
which
he
crawls
and
the
which
in
its
antic
shapes
holds
for
him
so
many
humorous
or
terrifying
stories
and
the
clock
which
chatters
and
stammers
so
many
words
which
he
alone
can
understand
how
many
things
there
are
in
this
room
he
does
not
know
them
all
every
day
he
sets
out
on
a
voyage
of
exploration
in
this
universe
which
is
his
everything
is
his
nothing
is
immaterial
everything
has
its
worth
man
or
fly
everything
lives
the
cat
the
fire
the
table
the
grains
of
dust
which
dance
in
a
sunbeam
the
room
is
a
country
a
day
is
a
lifetime
how
is
a
creature
to
know
himself
in
the
midst
of
these
vast
spaces
the
world
is
so
large
a
creature
is
lost
in
it
and
the
faces
the
actions
the
movement
the
noise
which
make
round
about
him
an
unending
turmoil
he
is
weary
his
eyes
close
he
goes
to
sleep
that
sweet
deep
sleep
that
overcomes
him
suddenly
at
any
time
and
wherever
he
may
be
on
his
mother
lap
or
under
the
table
where
he
loves
to
hide
it
is
good
all
is
good
these
first
days
come
buzzing
up
in
his
mind
like
a
field
of
corn
or
a
wood
stirred
by
the
wind
and
cast
in
shadow
by
the
great
fleeting
clouds
the
shadows
pass
the
sun
penetrates
the
forest
begins
to
find
his
way
through
the
labyrinth
of
the
day
it
is
morning
his
parents
are
asleep
he
is
in
his
little
bed
lying
on
his
back
he
looks
at
the
rays
of
light
dancing
on
the
ceiling
there
is
infinite
amusement
in
it
now
he
laughs
out
loud
with
one
of
those
jolly
children
laughs
which
stir
the
hearts
of
those
that
hear
them
his
mother
leans
out
of
her
bed
towards
him
and
says
what
is
it
then
little
mad
thing
then
he
laughs
again
and
perhaps
he
makes
an
effort
to
laugh
because
he
has
an
audience
his
mamma
looks
severe
and
lays
a
finger
on
her
lips
to
warn
him
lest
he
should
wake
his
father
but
her
weary
eyes
smile
in
spite
of
herself
they
whisper
together
then
there
is
a
furious
growl
from
his
father
both
tremble
his
mother
hastily
turns
her
back
on
him
like
a
naughty
little
girl
she
pretends
to
be
asleep
buries
himself
in
his
bed
and
holds
his
breath
dead
silence
after
some
time
the
little
face
hidden
under
the
clothes
comes
to
the
surface
again
on
the
roof
the
weathercock
creaks
the
gurgles
the
angelus
sounds
when
the
wind
comes
from
the
east
the
distant
bells
of
the
villages
on
the
other
bank
of
the
river
give
answer
the
sparrows
foregathered
in
the
wall
make
a
deafening
noise
from
which
three
or
four
voices
always
the
same
ring
out
more
shrilly
than
the
others
just
as
in
the
games
of
a
band
of
children
a
pigeon
coos
at
the
top
of
a
chimney
the
child
abandons
himself
to
the
lullaby
of
these
sounds
he
hums
to
himself
softly
then
a
little
more
loudly
then
quite
loudly
then
very
loudly
until
once
more
his
father
cries
out
in
exasperation
that
little
donkey
never
will
be
quiet
wait
a
little
and
i
pull
your
ears
then
buries
himself
in
the
bedclothes
again
and
does
not
know
whether
to
laugh
or
cry
he
is
terrified
and
humiliated
and
at
the
same
time
the
idea
of
the
donkey
with
which
his
father
has
compared
him
makes
him
burst
out
laughing
from
the
depths
of
his
bed
he
imitates
its
braying
this
time
he
is
whipped
he
sheds
every
tear
that
is
in
him
what
has
he
done
he
wanted
so
much
to
laugh
and
to
get
up
and
he
is
forbidden
to
budge
how
do
people
sleep
forever
when
will
they
get
up
one
day
he
could
not
contain
himself
he
heard
a
cat
and
a
dog
and
something
queer
in
the
street
he
slipped
out
of
bed
and
creeping
awkwardly
with
his
bare
feet
on
the
tiles
he
tried
to
go
down
the
stairs
to
see
what
it
was
but
the
door
was
shut
to
open
it
he
climbed
on
to
a
chair
the
whole
thing
collapsed
and
he
hurt
himself
and
howled
and
once
more
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
he
was
whipped
he
is
always
being
whipped
he
is
in
church
with
his
grandfather
he
is
bored
he
is
not
very
comfortable
he
is
forbidden
to
stir
and
all
the
people
are
saying
all
together
words
that
he
does
not
understand
they
all
look
solemn
and
gloomy
it
is
not
their
usual
way
of
looking
he
looks
at
them
half
frightened
old
lena
their
neighbor
who
is
sitting
next
to
him
looks
very
cross
there
are
moments
when
he
does
not
recognize
even
his
grandfather
he
is
afraid
a
little
then
he
grows
used
to
it
and
tries
to
find
relief
from
boredom
by
every
means
at
his
disposal
he
balances
on
one
leg
twists
his
neck
to
look
at
the
ceiling
makes
faces
pulls
his
grandfather
coat
investigates
the
straws
in
his
chair
tries
to
make
a
hole
in
them
with
his
finger
listens
to
the
singing
of
birds
and
yawns
so
that
he
is
like
to
dislocate
his
jaw
suddenly
there
is
a
deluge
of
sound
the
organ
is
played
a
thrill
goes
down
his
spine
he
turns
and
stands
with
his
chin
resting
on
the
back
of
his
chair
and
he
looks
very
wise
he
does
not
understand
this
noise
he
does
not
know
the
meaning
of
it
it
is
dazzling
bewildering
and
he
can
hear
nothing
clearly
but
it
is
good
it
is
as
though
he
were
no
longer
sitting
there
on
an
uncomfortable
chair
in
a
tiresome
old
house
he
is
suspended
in
like
a
bird
and
when
the
flood
of
sound
rushes
from
one
end
of
the
church
to
the
other
filling
the
arches
reverberating
from
wall
to
wall
he
is
carried
with
it
flying
and
skimming
hither
and
thither
with
nothing
to
do
but
to
abandon
himself
to
it
he
is
free
he
is
happy
the
sun
shines
he
falls
asleep
his
grandfather
is
displeased
with
him
he
behaves
ill
at
mass
he
is
at
home
sitting
on
the
ground
with
his
feet
in
his
hands
he
has
just
decided
that
the
is
a
boat
and
the
tiled
floor
a
river
he
all
but
drowned
in
stepping
off
the
carpet
he
is
surprised
and
a
little
put
out
that
the
others
pay
no
attention
to
the
matter
as
he
does
when
he
goes
into
the
room
he
seizes
his
mother
by
the
skirts
you
see
it
is
water
you
must
go
across
by
the
bridge
the
bridge
is
a
series
of
holes
between
the
red
tiles
his
mother
crosses
without
even
listening
to
him
he
is
vexed
as
a
dramatic
author
is
vexed
when
he
sees
his
audience
talking
during
his
great
work
next
moment
he
thinks
no
more
of
it
the
tiled
floor
is
no
longer
the
sea
he
is
lying
down
on
it
stretched
with
his
chin
on
the
tiles
humming
music
of
his
own
composition
and
gravely
sucking
his
thumb
and
dribbling
he
is
lost
in
contemplation
of
a
crack
between
the
tiles
the
lines
of
the
tiles
grimace
like
faces
the
imperceptible
hole
grows
larger
and
becomes
a
valley
there
are
mountains
about
it
a
centipede
moves
it
is
as
large
as
an
elephant
thunder
might
crash
the
child
would
not
hear
it
no
one
bothers
about
him
and
he
has
no
need
of
any
one
he
can
even
do
without
boats
and
caverns
in
the
tiled
floor
with
their
fantastic
fauna
his
body
is
enough
what
a
source
of
entertainment
he
spends
hours
in
looking
at
his
nails
and
shouting
with
laughter
they
have
all
different
faces
and
are
like
people
that
he
knows
and
the
rest
of
his
body
he
goes
on
with
the
inspection
of
all
that
he
has
how
many
surprising
things
there
are
so
many
marvels
he
is
absorbed
in
looking
at
them
but
he
was
very
roughly
picked
up
when
they
caught
him
at
it
sometimes
he
takes
advantage
of
his
mother
back
being
turned
to
escape
from
the
house
at
first
they
used
to
run
after
him
and
bring
him
back
then
they
got
used
to
letting
him
go
alone
only
so
he
did
not
go
too
far
away
the
house
is
at
the
end
of
the
town
the
country
begins
almost
at
once
as
long
as
he
is
within
sight
of
the
windows
he
goes
without
stopping
very
deliberately
and
now
and
then
hopping
on
one
foot
but
as
soon
as
he
has
passed
the
corner
of
the
road
and
the
brushwood
hides
him
from
view
he
changes
abruptly
he
stops
there
with
his
finger
in
his
mouth
to
find
out
what
story
he
shall
tell
himself
that
day
for
he
is
full
of
stories
true
they
are
all
very
much
like
each
other
and
every
one
of
them
could
be
told
in
a
few
lines
he
chooses
generally
he
takes
up
the
same
story
sometimes
from
the
point
where
it
left
off
sometimes
from
the
beginning
with
variations
but
any
trifle
a
word
heard
by
chance
is
enough
to
set
his
mind
off
on
another
direction
chance
was
fruitful
of
resources
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
what
can
be
made
of
a
simple
piece
of
wood
a
broken
bough
found
alongside
a
hedge
you
break
them
off
when
you
do
not
find
them
it
was
a
magic
wand
if
it
were
long
and
thin
it
became
a
lance
or
perhaps
a
sword
to
brandish
it
aloft
was
enough
to
cause
armies
to
spring
from
the
earth
was
their
general
marching
in
front
of
them
setting
them
an
example
and
leading
them
to
the
assault
of
a
hillock
if
the
branch
were
flexible
it
changed
into
a
whip
mounted
on
horseback
and
leaped
precipices
sometimes
his
mount
would
slip
and
the
horseman
would
find
himself
at
the
bottom
of
the
ditch
sorrily
looking
at
his
dirty
hands
and
barked
knees
if
the
wand
were
lithe
then
would
make
himself
the
conductor
of
an
orchestra
he
would
be
both
conductor
and
orchestra
he
conducted
and
he
sang
and
then
he
would
salute
the
bushes
with
their
little
green
heads
stirring
in
the
wind
he
was
also
a
magician
he
walked
with
great
strides
through
the
fields
looking
at
the
sky
and
waving
his
arms
he
commanded
the
clouds
he
wished
them
to
go
to
the
right
but
they
went
to
the
left
then
he
would
abuse
them
and
repeat
his
command
he
would
watch
them
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
and
his
heart
would
beat
as
he
looked
to
see
if
there
were
not
at
least
a
little
one
which
would
obey
him
but
they
went
on
calmly
moving
to
the
left
then
he
would
stamp
his
foot
and
threaten
them
with
his
stick
and
angrily
order
them
to
go
to
the
left
and
this
time
in
truth
they
obeyed
him
he
was
happy
and
proud
of
his
power
he
would
touch
the
flowers
and
bid
them
change
into
golden
carriages
as
he
had
been
told
they
did
in
the
stories
and
although
it
never
happened
he
was
quite
convinced
that
it
would
happen
if
only
he
had
patience
he
would
look
for
a
grasshopper
to
turn
into
a
hare
he
would
gently
lay
his
stick
on
its
back
and
speak
a
rune
the
insect
would
escape
he
would
bar
its
way
a
few
moments
later
he
would
be
lying
on
his
belly
near
to
it
looking
at
it
then
he
would
have
forgotten
that
he
was
a
magician
and
just
amuse
himself
with
turning
the
poor
beast
on
its
back
while
he
laughed
aloud
at
its
contortions
it
occurred
to
him
also
to
tie
a
piece
of
string
to
his
magic
wand
and
gravely
cast
it
into
the
river
and
wait
for
a
fish
to
come
and
bite
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
fish
do
not
usually
bite
at
a
piece
of
string
without
bait
or
hook
but
he
thought
that
for
once
in
a
way
and
for
him
they
might
make
an
exception
to
their
rule
and
in
his
inexhaustible
confidence
he
carried
it
so
far
as
to
fish
in
the
street
with
a
whip
through
the
grating
of
a
sewer
he
would
draw
up
the
whip
from
time
to
time
excitedly
pretending
that
the
cord
of
it
was
more
heavy
and
that
he
had
caught
a
treasure
as
in
a
story
that
his
grandfather
had
told
him
and
always
in
the
middle
of
all
these
games
there
used
to
occur
to
him
moments
of
strange
dreaming
and
complete
forgetfulness
everything
about
him
would
then
be
blotted
out
he
would
not
know
what
he
was
doing
and
was
not
even
conscious
of
himself
these
attacks
would
take
him
unawares
sometimes
as
he
walked
or
went
upstairs
a
void
would
suddenly
open
before
him
he
would
seem
then
to
have
lost
all
thought
but
when
he
came
back
to
himself
he
was
shocked
and
bewildered
to
find
himself
in
the
same
place
on
the
dark
staircase
it
was
as
though
he
had
lived
through
a
whole
lifetime
in
the
space
of
a
few
steps
his
grandfather
used
often
to
take
him
with
him
on
his
evening
walk
the
little
boy
used
to
trot
by
his
side
and
give
him
his
hand
they
used
to
go
by
the
roads
across
plowed
fields
which
smelled
strong
and
good
the
grasshoppers
chirped
enormous
crows
poised
along
the
road
used
to
watch
them
approach
from
afar
and
then
fly
away
heavily
as
they
came
up
with
them
his
grandfather
would
cough
knew
quite
well
what
that
meant
the
old
man
was
burning
with
the
desire
to
tell
a
story
but
he
wanted
it
to
appear
that
the
child
had
asked
him
for
one
did
not
fail
him
they
understood
each
other
the
old
man
had
a
tremendous
affection
for
his
grandson
and
it
was
a
great
joy
to
find
in
him
a
willing
audience
he
loved
to
tell
of
episodes
in
his
own
life
or
stories
of
great
men
ancient
and
modern
his
voice
would
then
become
emphatic
and
filled
with
emotion
and
would
tremble
with
a
childish
joy
which
he
used
to
try
to
stifle
he
seemed
delighted
to
hear
his
own
voice
unhappily
words
used
to
fail
him
when
he
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
he
was
used
to
such
disappointment
for
it
always
came
upon
him
with
his
outbursts
of
eloquence
and
as
he
used
to
forget
it
with
each
new
attempt
he
never
succeeded
in
resigning
himself
to
it
he
used
to
talk
of
regulus
and
arminius
of
the
soldiers
of
lützow
of
koerner
and
of
frédéric
stabs
who
tried
to
kill
the
emperor
napoleon
his
face
would
glow
as
he
told
of
incredible
deeds
of
heroism
he
used
to
pronounce
historic
words
in
such
a
solemn
voice
that
it
was
impossible
to
hear
them
and
he
used
to
try
artfully
to
keep
his
hearer
on
tenterhooks
at
the
thrilling
moments
he
would
stop
pretend
to
choke
and
noisily
blow
his
nose
and
his
heart
would
leap
when
the
child
asked
in
a
voice
choking
with
impatience
and
then
grandfather
there
came
a
day
when
was
a
little
older
when
he
perceived
his
grandfather
method
and
then
he
wickedly
set
himself
to
assume
an
air
of
indifference
to
the
rest
of
the
story
and
that
hurt
the
poor
old
man
but
for
the
moment
is
altogether
held
by
the
power
of
the
his
blood
leaped
at
the
dramatic
passages
he
did
not
know
what
it
was
all
about
neither
where
nor
when
these
deeds
were
done
or
whether
his
grandfather
knew
arminius
or
whether
regulus
were
not
god
knows
why
some
one
whom
he
had
seen
at
church
last
sunday
but
his
heart
and
the
old
man
heart
swelled
with
joy
and
pride
in
the
tale
of
heroic
deeds
as
though
they
themselves
had
done
them
for
the
old
man
and
the
child
were
both
children
was
less
happy
when
his
grandfather
interpolated
in
the
pathetic
passages
one
of
those
abstruse
discourses
so
dear
to
him
there
were
moral
thoughts
generally
traceable
to
some
idea
honest
enough
but
a
little
trite
such
as
gentleness
is
better
than
violence
or
honor
is
the
dearest
thing
in
life
or
it
is
better
to
be
good
than
to
be
wicked
only
they
were
much
more
involved
grandfather
had
no
fear
of
the
criticism
of
his
youthful
audience
and
abandoned
himself
to
his
habitual
emphatic
manner
he
was
not
afraid
of
repeating
the
same
phrases
or
of
not
finishing
them
or
even
if
he
lost
himself
in
his
discourse
of
saying
anything
that
came
into
his
head
to
stop
up
the
gaps
in
his
thoughts
and
he
used
to
punctuate
his
words
in
order
to
give
them
greater
force
with
inappropriate
gestures
the
boy
used
to
listen
with
profound
respect
and
he
thought
his
grandfather
very
eloquent
but
a
little
tiresome
both
of
them
loved
to
return
again
and
again
to
the
fabulous
legend
of
the
corsican
conqueror
who
had
taken
europe
grandfather
had
known
him
he
had
almost
fought
against
him
but
he
was
a
man
to
admit
the
greatness
of
his
adversaries
he
had
said
so
twenty
times
he
would
have
given
one
of
his
arms
for
such
a
man
to
have
been
born
on
this
side
of
the
rhine
fate
had
decreed
otherwise
he
admired
him
and
had
fought
against
him
that
is
he
had
been
on
the
point
of
fighting
against
him
but
when
napoleon
had
been
no
farther
than
ten
leagues
away
and
they
had
marched
out
to
meet
him
a
sudden
panic
had
dispersed
the
little
band
in
a
forest
and
every
man
had
fled
crying
we
are
betrayed
in
vain
as
the
old
man
used
to
tell
in
vain
did
he
endeavor
to
rally
the
fugitives
he
threw
himself
in
front
of
them
threatening
them
and
weeping
he
had
been
swept
away
in
the
flood
of
them
and
on
the
morrow
had
found
himself
at
an
extraordinary
distance
from
the
field
of
battle
for
so
he
called
the
place
of
the
rout
but
used
impatiently
to
bring
him
back
to
the
exploits
of
the
hero
and
he
was
delighted
by
his
marvelous
progress
through
the
world
he
saw
him
followed
by
innumerable
men
giving
vent
to
great
cries
of
love
and
at
a
wave
of
his
hand
hurling
themselves
in
swarms
upon
flying
enemies
they
were
always
in
flight
it
was
a
the
old
man
added
a
little
to
it
to
fill
out
the
story
he
conquered
spain
and
almost
conquered
england
which
he
could
not
abide
old
krafft
used
to
intersperse
his
enthusiastic
narratives
with
indignant
apostrophes
addressed
to
his
hero
the
patriot
awoke
in
him
more
perhaps
when
he
told
of
the
emperor
defeats
than
of
the
battle
of
jena
he
would
stop
to
shake
his
fist
at
the
river
and
spit
contemptuously
and
mouth
noble
insults
he
did
not
stoop
to
less
than
that
he
would
call
him
rascal
wild
beast
immoral
and
if
such
words
were
intended
to
restore
to
the
boy
mind
a
sense
of
justice
it
must
be
confessed
that
they
failed
in
their
object
for
childish
logic
leaped
to
this
conclusion
if
a
great
man
like
that
had
no
morality
morality
is
not
a
great
thing
and
what
matters
most
is
to
be
a
great
man
but
the
old
man
was
far
from
suspecting
the
thoughts
which
were
running
along
by
his
side
they
would
both
be
silent
pondering
each
after
his
own
fashion
these
admirable
stories
except
when
the
old
man
used
to
meet
one
of
his
noble
patrons
taking
a
walk
then
he
would
stop
and
bow
very
low
and
breathe
lavishly
the
formulæ
of
obsequious
politeness
the
child
used
to
blush
for
it
without
knowing
why
but
his
grandfather
at
heart
had
a
vast
respect
for
established
power
and
persons
who
had
arrived
and
possibly
his
great
love
for
the
heroes
of
whom
he
told
was
only
because
he
saw
in
them
persons
who
had
arrived
at
a
point
higher
than
the
others
when
it
was
very
hot
old
krafft
used
to
sit
under
a
tree
and
was
not
long
in
dozing
off
then
used
to
sit
near
him
on
a
heap
of
loose
stones
or
a
milestone
or
some
high
seat
uncomfortable
and
peculiar
and
he
used
to
wag
his
little
legs
and
hum
to
himself
and
dream
or
sometimes
he
used
to
lie
on
his
back
and
watch
the
clouds
go
by
they
looked
like
oxen
and
giants
and
hats
and
old
ladies
and
immense
landscapes
he
used
to
talk
to
them
in
a
low
voice
or
be
absorbed
in
a
little
cloud
which
a
great
one
was
on
the
point
of
devouring
he
was
afraid
of
those
which
were
very
black
almost
blue
and
of
those
which
went
very
fast
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
played
an
enormous
part
in
life
and
he
was
surprised
that
neither
his
grandfather
nor
his
mother
paid
any
attention
to
them
they
were
terrible
beings
if
they
wished
to
do
harm
fortunately
they
used
to
go
by
kindly
enough
a
little
grotesque
and
they
did
not
stop
the
boy
used
in
the
end
to
turn
giddy
with
watching
them
too
long
and
he
used
to
fidget
with
his
legs
and
arms
as
though
he
were
on
the
point
of
falling
from
the
sky
his
eyelids
then
would
wink
and
sleep
would
overcome
him
silence
the
leaves
murmur
gently
and
tremble
in
the
sun
a
faint
mist
passes
through
the
air
the
uncertain
flies
hover
booming
like
an
organ
the
grasshoppers
drunk
with
the
summer
chirp
eagerly
and
hurriedly
all
is
silent
under
the
vault
of
the
trees
the
cry
of
the
green
woodpecker
has
magic
sounds
far
away
on
the
plain
a
peasant
voice
harangues
his
oxen
the
shoes
of
a
horse
ring
out
on
the
white
road
eyes
close
near
him
an
ant
passes
along
a
dead
branch
across
a
furrow
he
loses
consciousness
ages
have
passed
he
wakes
the
ant
has
not
yet
crossed
the
twig
sometimes
the
old
man
would
sleep
too
long
and
his
face
would
grow
rigid
and
his
long
nose
would
grow
longer
and
his
mouth
stand
open
used
then
to
look
at
him
uneasily
and
in
fear
of
seeing
his
head
change
gradually
into
some
fantastic
shape
he
used
to
sing
loudly
so
as
to
wake
him
up
or
tumble
down
noisily
from
his
heap
of
stones
one
day
it
occurred
to
him
to
throw
a
handful
of
in
his
grandfather
face
and
tell
him
that
they
had
fallen
from
the
tree
the
old
man
believed
him
and
that
made
laugh
but
unfortunately
he
tried
the
trick
again
and
just
when
he
had
raised
his
hand
he
saw
his
grandfather
eyes
watching
him
it
was
a
terrible
affair
the
old
man
was
solemn
and
allowed
no
liberty
to
be
taken
with
the
respect
due
to
himself
they
were
estranged
for
more
than
a
week
the
worse
the
road
was
the
more
beautiful
it
was
to
every
stone
had
a
meaning
for
him
he
knew
them
all
the
shape
of
a
rut
seemed
to
him
to
be
a
geographical
accident
almost
of
the
same
kind
as
the
great
mass
of
the
taunus
in
his
head
he
had
the
map
of
all
the
ditches
and
hillocks
of
the
region
extending
two
kilometers
round
about
the
house
and
when
he
made
any
change
in
the
fixed
ordering
of
the
furrows
he
thought
himself
no
less
important
than
an
engineer
with
a
gang
of
navvies
and
when
with
his
heel
he
crushed
the
dried
top
of
a
clod
of
earth
and
filled
up
the
valley
at
the
foot
of
it
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
day
had
not
been
wasted
sometimes
they
would
meet
a
peasant
in
his
cart
on
the
highroad
and
if
the
peasant
knew
grandfather
they
would
climb
up
by
his
side
that
was
a
paradise
on
earth
the
horse
went
fast
and
laughed
with
delight
except
when
they
passed
other
people
walking
then
he
would
look
serious
and
indifferent
like
a
person
accustomed
to
drive
in
a
carriage
but
his
heart
was
filled
with
pride
his
grandfather
and
the
man
would
talk
without
bothering
about
him
hidden
and
crushed
by
their
legs
hardly
sitting
sometimes
not
sitting
at
all
he
was
perfectly
happy
he
talked
aloud
without
troubling
about
any
answer
to
what
he
said
he
watched
the
horse
ears
moving
what
strange
creatures
those
ears
were
they
moved
in
every
direction
to
right
and
left
they
hitched
forward
and
fell
to
one
side
and
turned
backwards
in
such
a
ridiculous
way
that
he
burst
out
laughing
he
would
pinch
his
grandfather
to
make
him
look
at
them
but
his
grandfather
was
not
interested
in
them
he
would
repulse
and
tell
him
to
be
quiet
would
ponder
he
thought
that
when
people
grow
up
they
are
not
surprised
by
anything
and
that
when
they
are
strong
they
know
everything
and
he
would
try
to
be
grown
up
himself
and
to
hide
his
curiosity
and
appear
to
be
indifferent
he
was
silent
them
the
rolling
of
the
carriage
made
him
drowsy
the
little
bells
danced
ding
ding
dong
ding
music
awoke
in
the
air
and
hovered
about
the
silvery
bells
like
a
swarm
of
bees
it
beat
gaily
with
the
rhythm
of
the
cart
an
endless
source
of
song
and
one
song
came
on
another
heels
to
they
were
superb
there
was
one
especially
which
he
thought
so
beautiful
that
he
tried
to
draw
his
grandfather
attention
to
it
he
sang
it
aloud
they
took
no
heed
of
him
he
began
it
again
in
a
higher
key
then
again
shrilly
and
then
old
jean
michel
said
irritably
be
quiet
you
are
deafening
me
with
your
that
took
away
his
breath
he
blushed
and
was
silent
and
mortified
he
crushed
with
his
contempt
the
two
stockish
imbeciles
who
did
not
understand
the
sublimity
of
his
song
which
opened
wide
the
heavens
he
thought
them
very
ugly
with
their
beards
and
they
smelled
very
ill
he
found
consolation
in
watching
the
horse
shadow
that
an
astonishing
sight
the
beast
ran
along
with
them
lying
on
its
side
in
the
evening
when
they
returned
it
covered
a
part
of
the
field
they
came
upon
a
rick
and
the
shadow
head
would
rise
up
and
then
return
to
its
place
when
they
had
passed
its
snout
was
flattened
out
like
a
burst
balloon
its
ears
were
large
and
pointed
like
candles
was
it
really
a
shadow
or
a
creature
would
not
have
liked
to
encounter
it
alone
he
would
not
have
run
after
it
as
he
did
after
his
grandfather
shadow
so
as
to
walk
on
its
head
and
trample
it
under
foot
the
shadows
of
the
trees
when
the
sun
was
low
were
also
objects
of
meditation
they
made
barriers
along
the
road
and
looked
like
phantoms
melancholy
and
grotesque
saying
go
no
farther
and
the
creaking
axles
and
the
horse
shoes
repeated
no
farther
grandfather
and
the
driver
never
ceased
their
endless
chatter
sometimes
they
would
raise
their
voices
especially
when
they
talked
of
local
affairs
or
things
going
wrong
the
child
would
cease
to
dream
and
look
at
them
uneasily
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
were
angry
with
each
other
and
he
was
afraid
that
they
would
come
to
blows
however
on
the
contrary
they
best
understood
each
other
in
their
common
dislikes
for
the
most
part
they
were
without
haired
or
the
least
passion
they
talked
of
small
matters
loudly
just
for
the
pleasure
of
talking
as
is
the
joy
of
the
people
but
not
understanding
their
conversation
only
heard
the
loud
tones
of
their
voices
and
saw
their
agitated
faces
and
thought
fearfully
how
wicked
he
looks
surely
they
hate
each
other
how
he
rolls
his
eyes
and
how
wide
he
opens
his
mouth
he
spat
on
my
nose
in
his
fury
o
lord
he
will
kill
my
grandfather
the
carriage
stopped
the
peasant
said
here
you
are
the
two
deadly
enemies
shook
hands
grandfather
got
down
first
the
peasant
handed
him
the
little
boy
the
whip
flicked
the
horse
the
carriage
rolled
away
and
there
they
were
by
the
little
sunken
road
near
the
rhine
the
sun
dipped
down
below
the
fields
the
path
wound
almost
to
the
edge
the
plentiful
soft
grass
yielded
under
their
feet
crackling
leaned
over
the
river
almost
half
in
the
water
a
cloud
of
gnats
danced
a
boat
passed
noiselessly
drawn
on
by
the
peaceful
current
striding
along
the
water
sucked
the
branches
of
the
willows
with
a
little
noise
like
lips
the
light
was
soft
and
misty
the
air
fresh
the
river
silvery
gray
they
reached
their
home
and
the
crickets
chirped
and
on
the
threshold
smiled
his
mother
dear
face
oh
delightful
memories
kindly
visions
which
will
hum
their
melody
in
their
tuneful
flight
through
life
journeys
in
later
life
great
towns
and
moving
seas
dream
countries
and
loved
faces
are
not
so
exactly
graven
in
the
soul
as
these
childish
walks
or
the
corner
of
the
garden
seen
every
day
through
the
window
through
the
steam
and
mist
made
by
the
mouth
glued
to
it
for
want
of
other
occupation
evening
now
and
the
house
is
shut
up
home
the
refuge
from
all
terrifying
things
darkness
night
fear
things
unknown
no
enemy
can
pass
the
threshold
the
fire
flares
a
golden
duck
turns
slowly
on
the
spit
a
delicious
smell
of
fat
and
of
crisping
flesh
scents
the
room
the
joy
of
eating
incomparable
delight
a
religious
enthusiasm
thrills
of
joy
the
body
is
too
languid
with
the
soft
warmth
and
the
fatigues
of
the
day
and
the
familiar
voices
the
act
of
digestion
plunges
it
in
ecstasy
and
faces
shadows
the
lampshade
the
tongues
of
flame
dancing
with
a
shower
of
stars
in
the
fireplace
all
take
on
a
magical
appearance
of
delight
lays
his
cheek
on
his
plate
the
better
to
enjoy
all
this
happiness
he
is
in
his
soft
bed
how
did
he
come
there
he
is
overcome
with
weariness
the
buzzing
of
the
voices
in
the
room
and
the
visions
of
the
day
are
intermingled
in
his
mind
his
father
takes
his
violin
the
shrill
sweet
sounds
cry
out
complaining
in
the
night
but
the
crowning
joy
is
when
his
mother
comes
and
takes
hands
he
is
drowsy
and
leaning
over
him
in
a
low
voice
she
sings
as
he
asks
an
old
song
with
words
that
have
no
meaning
his
father
thinks
such
music
stupid
but
never
wearies
of
it
he
holds
his
breath
and
is
between
laughing
and
crying
his
heart
is
intoxicated
he
does
not
know
where
he
is
and
he
is
overflowing
with
tenderness
he
throws
his
little
arms
round
his
mother
neck
and
hugs
her
with
all
his
strength
she
says
laughing
you
want
to
strangle
me
he
hugs
her
close
how
he
loves
her
how
he
loves
everything
everybody
everything
all
is
good
all
is
beautiful
he
sleeps
the
cricket
on
the
hearth
cheeps
his
grandfather
tales
the
great
heroes
float
by
in
the
happy
night
to
be
a
hero
like
them
yes
he
will
be
that
he
is
that
ah
how
good
it
is
to
live
what
an
abundance
of
strength
joy
pride
is
in
that
little
creature
what
superfluous
energy
his
body
and
mind
never
cease
to
move
they
are
carried
round
and
round
breathlessly
like
a
little
salamander
he
dances
day
and
night
in
the
flames
his
is
an
unwearying
enthusiasm
finding
its
food
in
all
things
a
delicious
dream
a
bubbling
well
a
treasure
of
inexhaustible
hope
a
laugh
a
song
unending
drunkenness
life
does
not
hold
him
yet
always
he
escapes
it
he
swims
in
the
infinite
how
happy
he
is
he
is
made
to
be
happy
there
is
nothing
in
him
that
does
not
believe
in
happiness
and
does
not
cling
to
it
with
all
his
little
strength
and
passion
life
will
soon
see
to
it
that
he
is
brought
to
reason

old

left
the
country
as

result
of
a
boyish
freak
a
violent
quarrel
such
as
he
had
often
had
for
he
was
devilish
pugnacious
and
it
had
had
an
unfortunate
ending
he
settled
down
almost
fifty
years
ago
in
the
little
town
of
the
principality
with
its
roofs
and
shady
gardens
lying
on
the
slope
of
a
gentle
hill
mirrored
in
the
pale
green
eyes
of
an
excellent
musician
he
had
readily
gained
appreciation
in
a
country
of
musicians
he
had
taken
root
there
by

years

for
fifteen
years
and
they
had
four
children
then
clara
died
and
jean
michel
bemoaned
her
loss
and
then
five
months
later
married
ottilia
schütz
a
girl
of
twenty
with
red
cheeks
robust
and
smiling
after
eight
years
of
marriage
she
also
died
but
in
that
time
she
gave
him
seven
children
eleven
children
in
all
of
whom
only
one
had
survived
although
he
loved
them
much
all
these
bereavements
had
not
shaken
his
the
greatest
blow
had
been
the
death
of
ottilia
three
years
ago
which
had
come
to
him
at
an
age
when
it
is
difficult
to
start
life
again
and
to
make
a
new
home
but
after
a
moment
confusion
old
jean
michel
regained
his
equilibrium
which
no
misfortune
seemed
able
to
disturb
he
was
an
affectionate
man
but
health
was
the
strongest
thing
in
him
he
had
a
physical
repugnance
from
sadness
and
a
need
of
gaiety
great
gaiety
flemish
fashion
an
enormous
and
childish
laugh
whatever
might
be
his
grief
he
did
not
drink
one
drop
the
less
nor
miss
one
bite
at
table
and
his
band
never
had
one
day
off
under
his
direction
the
court
orchestra
won
a
small
celebrity
in
the
rhine
country
where
jean
michel
had
become
legendary
by
reason
of
his
athletic
stature
and
his
outbursts
of
anger
he
could
not
master
them
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
for
the
violent
man
was
at
bottom
timid
and
afraid
of
compromising
himself
he
loved
decorum
and
feared
opinion
but
his
blood
ran
away
with
him
he
used
to
see
red
and
he
used
to
be
the
victim
of
sudden
fits
of
crazy
impatience
not
only
at
rehearsals
but
at
the
concerts
where
once
in
the
prince
presence
he
had
hurled
his
bâton
and
had
stamped
about
like
a
man
possessed
as
he
apostrophized
one
of
the
musicians
in
a
furious
and
stuttering
voice
the
prince
was
amused
but
the
artists
in
question
were
rancorous
against
him
in
vain
did
jean
michel
ashamed
of
his
outburst
try
to
pass
it
by
immediately
in
exaggerated
obsequiousness
on
the
next
occasion
he
would
break
out
again
and
as
this
extreme
irritability
increased
with
age
in
the
end
it
made
his
position
very
difficult
he
felt
it
himself
and
one
day
when
his
outbursts
had
all
but
caused
the
whole
orchestra
to
strike
he
sent
in
his
resignation
he
hoped
that
in
consideration
of
his
services
they
would
make
difficulties
about
accepting
it
and
would
ask
him
to
stay
there
was
nothing
of
the
kind
and
as
he
was
too
proud
to
go
back
on
his
offer
he
left
brokenhearted
and
crying
out
upon
the
ingratitude
of
mankind
since
that
time
he
had
not
known
how
to
fill
his
days
he
was
more
than
seventy
but
he
was
still
vigorous
and
he
went
on
working
and
going
up
and
down
the
town
from
morning
to
night
giving
lessons
and
entering
into
discussions
pronouncing
perorations
and
entering
into
everything
he
was
ingenious
and
found
all
sorts
of
ways
of
keeping
himself
occupied
he
began
to
repair
musical
instruments
he
invented
experimented
and
sometimes
discovered
improvements
he
composed
also
and
set
store
by
his
compositions
he
had
once
written
a
of
which
he
used
often
to
talk
and
it
was
the
glory
of
his
family
it
had
cost
him
so
much
trouble
that
he
had
all
but
brought
about
a
congestion
of
the
mind
in
the
writing
of
it
he
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
it
was
a
work
of
genius
but
he
knew
perfectly
well
with
what
emptiness
of
thought
it
had
been
written
and
he
dared
not
look
again
at
the
manuscript
because
every
time
he
did
so
he
recognized
in
the
phrases
that
he
had
thought
to
be
his
own
rags
taken
from
other
authors
painfully
pieced
together
haphazard
it
was
a
great
sorrow
to
him
he
had
ideas
sometimes
which
he
thought
admirable
he
would
run
tremblingly
to
his
table
could
he
keep
his
inspiration
this
time
but
hardly
had
he
taken
pen
in
hand
than
he
found
himself
alone
in
silence
and
all
his
efforts
to
call
to
life
again
the
vanished
voices
ended
only
in
bringing
to
his
ears
familiar
melodies
of
mendelssohn
or
brahms
there
are
says
george
sand
unhappy
geniuses
who
lack
the
power
of
expression
and
carry
down
to
their
graves
the
unknown
region
of
their
thoughts
as
has
said
a
member
of
that
great
family
of
illustrious
mutes
or
stammerers
geoffrey
old
jean
michel
belonged
to
that
family
he
was
no
more
successful
in
expressing
himself
in
music
than
in
words
and
he
always
deceived
himself
he
would
so
much
have
loved
to
talk
to
write
to
be
a
great
musician
an
eloquent
orator
it
was
his
secret
sore
he
told
no
one
of
it
did
not
admit
it
to
himself
tried
not
to
think
of
it
but
he
did
think
of
it
in
spite
of
himself
and
so
there
was
the
seed
of
death
in
his
soul
poor
old
man
in
nothing
did
he
succeed
in
being
absolutely
himself
there
were
in
him
so
many
seeds
of
beauty
and
power
but
they
never
put
forth
fruit
a
profound
and
touching
faith
in
the
dignity
of
art
and
the
moral
value
of
life
but
it
was
nearly
always
translated
in
an
emphatic
and
ridiculous
fashion
so
much
noble
pride
and
in
life
an
almost
servile
admiration
of
his
superiors
so
lofty
a
desire
for
independence
and
in
fact
absolute
docility
pretensions
to
strength
of
mind
and
every
conceivable
superstition
a
passion
for
heroism
real
courage
and
so
much
timidity
a
nature
to
stop
by
the
wayside
jean
michel
had
transferred
all
his
ambitions
to
his
son
and
at
first
melchior
had
promised
to
realize
them
from
childhood
he
had
shown
great
musical
gifts
he
learned
with
extraordinary
facility
and
quickly
acquired
as
a
violinist
a
virtuosity
which
for
a
long
time
made
him
the
favorite
almost
the
idol
of
the
court
concerts
he
played
the
piano
and
other
instruments
pleasantly
he
was
a
fine
talker
well
though
a
little
heavily
built
and
was
of
the
type
which
passes
in
germany
for
classic
beauty
he
had
a
large
brow
that
expressed
nothing
large
regular
features
and
a
curled
beard
a
jupiter
of
the
banks
of
the
rhine
old
jean
michel
enjoyed
his
son
success
he
was
ecstatic
over
the
virtuoso
de
he
who
had
never
been
able
properly
to
play
any
instrument
in
truth
melchior
would
have
had
no
difficulty
in
expressing
what
he
thought
the
trouble
was
that
he
did
not
think
and
he
did
not
even
bother
about
it
he
had
the
soul
of
a
mediocre
comedian
who
takes
pains
with
the
inflexions
of
his
voice
without
caring
about
what
they
express
and
with
anxious
vanity
watches
their
effect
on
his
audience
the
odd
thing
was
that
in
spite
of
his
constant
anxiety
about
his
stage
pose
there
was
in
him
as
in
jean
michel
in
spite
of
his
timid
respect
for
social
conventions
a
curious
irregular
unexpected
and
chaotic
quality
which
made
people
say
that
the
kraffts
were
a
bit
crazy
it
did
not
harm
him
at
first
it
seemed
as
though
these
very
eccentricities
were
the
proof
of
the
genius
attributed
to
him
for
it
is
understood
among
people
of
common
sense
that
an
artist
has
none
but
it
was
not
long
before
his
extravagances
were
traced
to
their
source
usually
the
bottle
nietzsche
says
that
bacchus
is
the
god
of
music
and
melchior
instinct
was
of
the
same
opinion
but
in
his
case
his
god
was
very
ungrateful
to
him
far
from
giving
him
the
ideas
he
lacked
he
took
away
from
him
the
few
that
he
had
after
his
absurd
marriage
absurd
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
and
therefore
also
in
his
own
he
gave
himself
up
to
it
more
and
more
he
neglected
his
playing
so
secure
in
his
own
superiority
that
very
soon
he
lost
it
other
came
to
succeed
him
in
public
favor
that
was
bitter
to
him
but
instead
of
rousing
his
energy
these
rebuffs
only
discouraged
him
he
avenged
himself
by
crying
down
his
rivals
with
his
in
his
absurd
conceit
he
counted
on
succeeding
his
father
as
musical
director
another
man
was
appointed
he
thought
himself
persecuted
and
took
on
the
airs
of
a
misunderstood
genius
thanks
to
the
esteem
in
which
old
krafft
was
held
he
kept
his
place
as
a
violin
in
the
orchestra
but
gradually
he
lost
all
his
lessons
in
the
town
and
if
this
blow
struck
most
at
his
vanity
it
touched
his
purse
even
more
for
several
years
the
resources
of
his
household
had
grown
less
and
less
following
on
various
reverses
of
fortune
after
having
known
plenty
want
came
and
every
day
increased
melchior
refused
to
take
notice
of
it
he
did
not
spend
one
penny
the
less
on
his
toilet
or
his
pleasures
he
was
not
a
bad
man
but
a
man
which
is
perhaps
worse
weak
without
spring
without
moral
strength
but
for
the
rest
in
his
own
opinion
a
good
father
a
good
son
a
good
husband
a
good
man
and
perhaps
he
was
good
if
to
be
so
it
is
enough
to
possess
an
easy
kindness
which
is
quickly
touched
and
that
animal
affection
by
which
a
man
loves
his
kin
as
a
part
of
himself
it
can
not
even
be
said
that
he
was
very
egoistic
he
had
not
personality
enough
for
that
he
was
nothing
they
are
a
terrible
thing
in
life
these
people
who
are
nothing
like
a
dead
weight
thrown
into
the
air
they
fall
and
must
fall
and
in
their
fall
they
drag
with
them
everything
that
they
have
it
was
when
the
situation
of
his
family
had
reached
its
most
difficult
point
that
little
began
to
understand
what
was
going
on
about
him
he
was
no
longer
the
only
child
melchior
gave
his
wife
a
child
every
year
without
troubling
to
think
what
was
to
become
of
it
later
two
had
died
young
two
others
were
three
and
four
years
old
melchior
never
bothered
about
them
louisa
when
she
had
to
go
out
left
them
with
now
six
years
old
the
charge
cost
something
for
he
had
to
sacrifice
to
his
duty
his
splendid
afternoons
in
the
fields
but
he
was
proud
of
being
treated
as
a
man
and
gravely
fulfilled
his
task
he
amused
the
children
as
best
he
could
by
showing
them
his
games
and
he
set
himself
to
talk
to
them
as
he
had
heard
his
mother
talking
to
the
baby
or
he
would
carry
them
in
his
arms
one
after
another
as
he
had
seen
her
do
he
bent
under
their
weight
and
clenched
his
teeth
and
with
all
his
strength
clutched
his
little
brother
to
his
breast
so
as
to
prevent
his
falling
the
children
always
wanted
to
be
carried
they
were
never
tired
of
it
and
when
could
do
no
more
they
wept
without
ceasing
they
made
him
very
unhappy
and
he
was
often
troubled
about
them
they
were
very
dirty
and
needed
maternal
attentions
did
not
know
what
to
do
they
took
advantage
of
him
sometimes
he
wanted
to
slap
them
but
he
thought
they
are
little
they
do
not
know
and
magnanimously
he
let
them
pinch
him
and
beat
him
and
tease
him
ernest
used
to
howl
for
nothing
he
used
to
stamp
his
feet
and
roll
about
in
a
passion
he
was
a
nervous
child
and
louisa
had
bidden
not
to
oppose
his
whims
as
for
rodolphe
he
was
as
malicious
as
a
monkey
he
always
took
advantage
of
having
ernest
in
his
arms
to
play
all
sorts
of
silly
pranks
behind
his
back
he
used
to
break
toys
spill
water
dirty
his
frock
and
knock
the
plates
over
as
he
rummaged
in
the
cupboard
and
when
louisa
returned
instead
of
praising
she
used
to
say
to
him
without
scolding
him
but
with
an
injured
air
as
she
saw
the
havoc
my
poor
child
you
are
not
very
clever
would
be
mortified
and
his
heart
would
grow
big
within
him
louisa
who
let
no
opportunity
escape
of
earning
a
little
money
used
to
go
out
as
cook
for
exceptional
occasions
such
as
marriages
or
baptismal
feasts
melchior
pretended
to
know
nothing
about
it
it
touched
his
vanity
but
he
was
not
annoyed
with
her
for
doing
it
so
long
as
he
did
not
know
had
as
yet
no
idea
of
the
difficulties
of
life
he
knew
no
other
limit
to
his
will
than
the
will
of
his
parents
and
that
did
not
stand
much
in
his
way
for
they
let
him
do
pretty
much
as
he
pleased
his
one
idea
was
to
grow
up
so
as
to
be
able
to
do
as
he
liked
he
had
no
conception
of
obstacles
standing
in
the
way
at
every
turn
and
he
had
never
the
least
idea
but
that
his
parents
were
completely
their
own
masters
it
was
a
shock
to
his
whole
being
when
for
the
first
time
he
perceived
that
among
men
there
are
those
who
command
and
those
who
are
commanded
and
that
his
own
people
were
not
of
the
first
class
it
was
the
first
crisis
of
his
life
it
happened
one
afternoon
his
mother
had
dressed
him
in
his
cleanest
clothes
old
clothes
given
to
her
which
louisa
ingenuity
and
patience
had
turned
to
account
he
went
to
find
her
as
they
had
agreed
at
the
house
in
which
she
was
working
he
was
abashed
at
the
idea
of
entering
alone
a
footman
was
swaggering
in
the
porch
he
stopped
the
boy
and
asked
him
patronizingly
what
he
wanted
blushed
and
murmured
that
he
had
come
to
see
frau
krafft
as
he
had
been
told
to
say
frau
krafft
what
do
you
want
with
frau
krafft
asked
the
footman
ironically
emphasizing
the
word
your
mother
go
down
there
you
will
find
louisa
in
the
kitchen
at
the
end
of
the
passage
he
went
growing
redder
and
redder
he
was
ashamed
to
hear
his
mother
called
familiarly
he
was
humiliated
he
would
have
liked
to
run
away
down
to
his
dear
river
and
the
shelter
of
the
brushwood
where
he
used
to
tell
himself
stories
in
the
kitchen
he
came
upon
a
number
of
other
servants
who
greeted
him
with
noisy
exclamations
at
the
back
near
the
stove
his
mother
smiled
at
him
with
tender
embarrassment
he
ran
to
her
and
clung
to
her
skirts
she
was
wearing
a
white
apron
and
holding
a
wooden
spoon
she
made
him
more
unhappy
by
trying
to
raise
his
chin
so
as
to
look
in
his
face
and
to
make
him
hold
out
his
hand
to
everybody
there
and
say
to
them
he
would
not
he
turned
to
the
wall
and
hid
his
face
in
his
arms
then
gradually
he
gained
courage
and
peeped
out
of
his
with
merry
bright
eyes
which
hid
again
every
time
any
one
looked
at
him
he
stole
looks
at
the
people
there
his
mother
looked
busy
and
important
and
he
did
not
know
her
like
that
she
went
from
one
saucepan
to
another
tasting
giving
advice
in
a
sure
voice
explaining
recipes
and
the
cook
of
the
house
listened
respectfully
the
boy
heart
swelled
with
pride
as
he
saw
how
much
his
mother
was
appreciated
and
the
great
part
that
she
played
in
this
splendid
room
adorned
with
magnificent
objects
of
gold
and
silver
suddenly
conversation
ceased
the
door
opened
a
lady
entered
with
a
rustling
of
the
stuffs
she
was
wearing
she
cast
a
suspicious
look
about
her
she
was
no
longer
young
and
yet
she
was
wearing
a
light
dress
with
wide
sleeves
she
caught
up
her
dress
in
her
hand
so
as
not
to
brush
against
anything
it
did
not
prevent
her
going
to
the
stove
and
looking
at
the
dishes
and
even
tasting
them
when
she
raised
her
hand
a
little
her
sleeve
fell
back
and
her
arm
was
bare
to
the
elbow
thought
this
ugly
and
improper
how
dryly
and
abruptly
she
spoke
to
louisa
and
how
humbly
louisa
replied
hated
it
he
hid
away
in
his
corner
so
as
not
to
be
observed
but
it
was
no
use
the
lady
asked
who
the
little
boy
might
be
louisa
fetched
him
and
presented
him
she
held
his
hands
to
prevent
his
hiding
his
face
and
though
he
wanted
to
break
away
and
flee
felt
instinctively
that
this
time
he
must
not
resist
the
lady
looked
at
the
boy
scared
face
and
at
first
she
gave
him
a
kindly
motherly
smile
but
then
she
resumed
her
patronizing
air
and
asked
him
about
his
behavior
and
his
piety
and
put
questions
to
him
to
which
he
did
not
reply
she
looked
to
see
how
his
clothes
fitted
him
and
louisa
eagerly
declared
that
they
were
magnificent
she
pulled
down
his
waistcoat
to
remove
the
creases
wanted
to
cry
it
fitted
so
tightly
he
did
not
understand
why
his
mother
was
giving
thanks
the
lady
took
him
by
the
hand
and
said
that
she
would
take
him
to
her
own
children
cast
a
look
of
despair
at
his
mother
but
she
smiled
at
the
mistress
so
eagerly
that
he
saw
that
there
was
nothing
to
hope
for
from
her
and
he
followed
his
guide
like
a
sheep
that
is
led
to
the
slaughter
they
came
to
a
garden
where
two
children
a
boy
and
a
girl
about
the
same
age
as
were
apparently
sulky
with
each
other
advent
created
a
diversion
they
came
up
to
examine
the
new
arrival
left
with
the
children
by
the
lady
stood
in
a
pathway
not
daring
to
raise
his
eyes
the
two
others
stood
motionless
a
short
distance
away
and
looked
him
up
and
down
nudged
each
other
and
tittered
finally
they
made
up
their
minds
they
asked
him
who
he
was
whence
he
came
and
what
his
father
did
turned
to
stone
made
no
reply
he
was
terrified
almost
to
the
point
of
tears
especially
of
the
little
girl
who
had
fair
hair
in
plaits
a
short
skirt
and
bare
legs
they
began
to
play
just
as
was
beginning
to
be
a
little
happier
the
little
boy
stopped
dead
in
front
of
him
and
touching
his
coat
said
hullo
that
mine
did
not
understand
furious
at
this
assertion
that
his
coat
belonged
to
some
one
else
he
shook
his
head
violently
in
denial
i
know
it
all
right
said
the
boy
it
my
old
blue
waistcoat
there
a
spot
on
it
and
he
put
his
finger
on
the
spot
then
going
on
with
his
inspection
he
examined
feet
and
asked
what
his
shoes
were
made
of
grew
crimson
the
little
girl
pouted
and
whispered
to
her
brother
heard
it
that
it
was
a
little
poor
boy
resented
the
word
he
thought
he
would
succeed
in
combating
the
insulting
opinions
as
he
stammered
in
a
choking
voice
that
he
was
the
son
of
melchior
krafft
and
that
his
mother
was
louisa
the
cook
it
seemed
to
him
that
this
title
was
as
good
as
any
other
and
he
was
right
but
the
two
children
interested
in
the
news
did
not
seem
to
esteem
him
any
the
more
for
it
on
the
contrary
they
took
on
a
patronizing
tone
they
asked
him
what
he
was
going
to
be
a
cook
or
a
coachman
revolted
he
felt
an
iciness
steal
into
his
heart
encouraged
by
his
silence
the
two
rich
children
who
had
conceived
for
the
little
poor
boy
one
of
those
cruel
and
unreasoning
antipathies
which
children
have
tried
various
amusing
ways
of
tormenting
him
the
little
girl
especially
was
implacable
she
observed
that
could
hardly
run
because
his
clothes
were
so
tight
and
she
conceived
the
subtle
idea
of
making
him
jump
they
made
an
obstacle
of
little
seats
and
insisted
on
clearing
it
the
wretched
child
dared
not
say
what
it
was
that
prevented
his
jumping
he
gathered
himself
together
hurled
himself
through
the
air
and
measured
his
length
on
the
ground
they
roared
with
laughter
at
him
he
had
to
try
again
tears
in
his
eyes
he
made
a
desperate
attempt
and
this
time
succeeded
in
jumping
that
did
not
satisfy
his
tormentors
who
decided
that
the
obstacle
was
not
high
enough
and
they
built
it
up
until
it
became
a
regular
affair
tried
to
rebel
and
declared
that
he
would
not
jump
then
the
little
girl
called
him
a
coward
and
said
that
he
was
afraid
could
not
stand
that
and
knowing
that
he
must
fall
he
jumped
and
fell
his
feet
caught
in
the
obstacle
the
whole
thing
toppled
over
with
him
he
grazed
his
hands
and
almost
broke
his
head
and
as
a
crowning
misfortune
his
trousers
tore
at
the
knees
and
elsewhere
he
was
sick
with
shame
he
heard
the
two
children
dancing
with
delight
round
him
he
suffered
horribly
he
felt
that
they
despised
and
hated
him
why
why
he
would
gladly
have
died
there
is
no
more
cruel
suffering
than
that
of
a
child
who
discovers
for
the
first
time
the
wickedness
of
others
he
believes
then
that
he
is
persecuted
by
the
whole
world
and
there
is
nothing
to
support
him
there
is
nothing
then
nothing
tried
to
get
up
the
little
boy
pushed
him
down
again
the
little
girl
kicked
him
he
tried
again
and
they
both
jumped
on
him
and
sat
on
his
back
and
pressed
his
face
down
into
the
ground
then
rage
seized
him
it
was
too
much
his
hands
were
bruised
his
fine
coat
was
torn
a
catastrophe
for
him
shame
pain
revolt
against
the
injustice
of
it
so
many
misfortunes
all
at
once
plunged
him
in
blind
fury
he
rose
to
his
hands
and
knees
shook
himself
like
a
dog
and
rolled
his
tormentors
over
and
when
they
returned
to
the
assault
he
butted
at
them
head
down
bowled
over
the
little
girl
and
with
one
blow
of
his
fist
knocked
the
boy
into
the
middle
of
a
they
howled
the
children
ran
into
the
house
with
piercing
cries
doors
slammed
and
cries
of
anger
were
heard
the
lady
ran
out
as
quickly
as
her
long
dress
would
let
her
saw
her
coming
and
made
no
attempt
to
escape
he
was
terrified
at
what
he
had
done
it
was
a
thing
unheard
of
a
crime
but
he
regretted
nothing
he
waited
he
was
lost
so
much
the
better
he
was
reduced
to
despair
the
lady
pounced
on
him
he
felt
her
beat
him
he
heard
her
talking
in
a
furious
voice
a
flood
of
words
but
he
could
distinguish
nothing
his
little
enemies
had
come
back
to
see
his
shame
and
screamed
shrilly
there
were
servants
a
babel
of
voices
to
complete
his
downfall
louisa
who
had
been
summoned
appeared
and
instead
of
defending
him
she
began
to
scold
him
she
too
without
knowing
anything
and
bade
him
beg
pardon
he
refused
angrily
she
shook
him
and
dragged
him
by
the
hand
to
the
lady
and
the
children
and
bade
him
go
on
his
knees
but
he
stamped
and
roared
and
bit
his
mother
hand
finally
he
escaped
among
the
servants
who
laughed
he
went
away
his
heart
beating
furiously
his
face
burning
with
anger
and
the
slaps
which
he
had
received
he
tried
not
to
think
and
he
hurried
along
because
he
did
not
want
to
cry
in
the
street
he
wanted
to
be
at
home
so
as
to
be
able
to
find
the
comfort
of
tears
he
choked
the
blood
beat
in
his
head
he
was
at
finally
he
arrived
he
ran
up
the
old
black
staircase
to
his
usual
nook
in
the
bay
of
a
window
above
the
river
he
hurled
himself
into
it
breathlessly
and
then
there
came
a
flood
of
tears
he
did
not
know
exactly
why
he
was
crying
but
he
had
to
cry
and
when
the
first
flood
of
them
was
done
he
wept
again
because
he
wanted
with
a
sort
of
rage
to
make
himself
suffer
as
if
he
could
in
this
way
punish
the
others
as
well
as
himself
then
he
thought
that
his
father
must
be
coming
home
and
that
his
mother
would
tell
him
everything
and
that
his
own
miseries
were
by
no
means
at
an
end
he
resolved
on
flight
no
matter
whither
never
to
return
just
as
he
was
going
downstairs
he
bumped
into
his
father
who
was
coming
up
what
are
you
doing
boy
where
are
you
going
asked
melchior
he
did
not
reply
you
are
up
to
some
folly
what
have
you
done
held
his
peace
what
have
you
done
repeated
melchior
will
you
answer
the
boy
began
to
cry
and
melchior
to
shout
vying
with
each
other
until
they
heard
louisa
hurriedly
coming
up
the
stairs
she
arrived
still
upset
she
began
with
violent
reproach
and
further
chastisement
in
which
melchior
joined
as
soon
as
he
understood
and
probably
before
with
blows
that
would
have
felled
an
ox
both
shouted
the
boy
roared
they
ended
by
angry
argument
all
the
time
that
he
was
beating
his
son
melchior
maintained
that
he
was
right
and
that
this
was
the
sort
of
thing
that
one
came
by
by
going
out
to
service
with
people
who
thought
they
could
do
everything
because
they
had
money
and
as
she
beat
the
child
louisa
shouted
that
her
husband
was
a
brute
that
she
would
never
let
him
touch
the
boy
and
that
he
had
really
hurt
him
was
in
fact
bleeding
a
little
from
the
nose
but
he
hardly
gave
a
thought
to
it
and
he
was
not
in
the
least
thankful
to
his
mother
for
stopping
it
with
a
wet
cloth
since
she
went
on
scolding
him
in
the
end
they
pushed
him
away
in
a
dark
closet
and
shut
him
up
without
any
supper
he
heard
them
shouting
at
each
other
and
he
did
not
know
which
of
them
he
detested
most
he
thought
it
must
be
his
mother
for
he
had
never
expected
any
such
wickedness
from
her
all
the
misfortunes
of
the
day
overwhelmed
him
all
that
he
had
suffered
the
injustice
of
the
children
the
injustice
of
the
lady
the
injustice
of
his
parents
and
this
he
felt
like
an
open
wound
without
quite
knowing
why
the
degradation
of
his
parents
of
whom
he
was
so
proud
before
these
evil
and
contemptible
people
such
cowardice
of
which
for
the
first
time
he
had
become
vaguely
conscious
seemed
ignoble
to
him
everything
was
upset
for
him
his
admiration
for
his
own
people
the
religious
respect
with
which
they
inspired
him
his
confidence
in
life
the
simple
need
that
he
had
of
loving
others
and
of
being
loved
his
moral
faith
blind
but
absolute
it
was
a
complete
cataclysm
he
was
crushed
by
brute
force
without
any
means
of
defending
himself
or
of
ever
again
escaping
he
choked
he
thought
himself
on
the
point
of
death
all
his
body
stiffened
in
desperate
revolt
he
beat
with
fists
feet
head
against
the
wall
howled
was
seized
with
convulsions
and
fell
to
the
floor
hurting
himself
against
the
furniture
his
parents
running
up
took
him
in
their
arms
they
vied
with
each
other
now
as
to
who
should
be
the
more
tender
with
him
his
mother
undressed
him
carried
him
to
his
bed
and
sat
by
him
and
remained
with
him
until
he
was
calmer
but
he
did
not
yield
one
inch
he
forgave
her
nothing
and
pretended
to
be
asleep
to
get
rid
of
her
his
mother
seemed
to
him
bad
and
cowardly
he
had
no
suspicion
of
all
the
suffering
that
she
had
to
go
through
in
order
to
live
and
give
a
living
to
her
family
and
of
what
she
had
borne
in
taking
sides
against
him
after
he
had
exhausted
to
the
last
drop
the
incredible
store
of
tears
that
is
in
the
eyes
of
a
child
he
felt
somewhat
comforted
he
was
tired
and
worn
out
but
his
nerves
were
too
much
on
stretch
for
him
to
sleep
the
visions
that
had
been
with
him
floated
before
him
again
in
his
especially
he
saw
again
the
little
girl
with
her
bright
eyes
and
her
disdainful
little
nose
her
hair
hanging
down
to
her
shoulders
her
bare
legs
and
her
childish
affected
way
of
talking
he
trembled
as
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
hear
her
voice
he
remembered
how
stupid
he
had
been
with
her
and
he
conceived
a
savage
hatred
for
her
he
did
not
pardon
her
for
having
brought
him
low
and
was
consumed
with
the
desire
to
humiliate
her
and
to
make
her
weep
he
sought
means
of
doing
this
but
found
none
there
was
no
sign
of
her
ever
caring
about
him
but
by
way
of
consoling
himself
he
supposed
that
everything
was
as
he
wished
it
to
be
he
supposed
that
he
had
become
very
powerful
and
famous
and
decided
that
she
was
in
love
with
him
then
he
began
to
tell
himself
one
of
those
absurd
stories
which
in
the
end
he
would
regard
as
more
real
than
reality
she
was
dying
of
love
but
he
spurned
her
when
he
passed
before
her
house
she
watched
him
pass
hiding
behind
the
curtains
and
he
knew
that
she
watched
him
but
he
pretended
to
take
no
notice
and
talked
gaily
even
he
left
the
country
and
journeyed
far
to
add
to
her
anguish
he
did
great
things
here
he
introduced
into
his
narrative
fragments
chosen
from
his
grandfather
heroic
tales
and
all
this
time
she
was
falling
ill
of
grief
her
mother
that
proud
dame
came
to
beg
of
him
my
poor
child
is
dying
i
beg
you
to
come
he
went
she
was
in
her
bed
her
face
was
pale
and
sunken
she
held
out
her
arms
to
him
she
could
not
speak
but
she
took
his
hands
and
kissed
them
as
she
wept
then
he
looked
at
her
with
marvelous
kindness
and
tenderness
he
bade
her
recover
and
consented
to
let
her
love
him
at
this
point
of
the
story
when
he
amused
himself
by
drawing
out
the
coming
together
by
repeating
their
gestures
and
words
several
times
sleep
overcame
him
and
he
slept
and
was
consoled
but
when
he
opened
his
eyes
it
was
day
and
it
no
longer
shone
so
lightly
or
so
carelessly
as
its
predecessor
there
was
a
great
change
in
the
world
now
knew
the
meaning
of
injustice
there
were
now
times
of
extremely
straitened
circumstances
at
home
they
became
more
and
more
frequent
they
lived
meagerly
then
no
one
was
more
sensible
of
it
than
his
father
saw
nothing
he
was
served
first
and
there
was
always
enough
for
him
he
talked
noisily
and
roared
with
laughter
at
his
own
jokes
and
he
never
noticed
his
wife
glances
as
she
gave
a
forced
laugh
while
she
watched
him
helping
himself
when
he
passed
the
dish
it
was
more
than
half
empty
louisa
helped
the
children
two
potatoes
each
when
it
came
to
turn
there
were
sometimes
only
three
left
and
his
mother
was
not
helped
he
knew
that
beforehand
he
had
counted
them
before
they
came
to
him
then
he
summoned
up
courage
and
said
carelessly
only
one
mother
she
was
a
little
put
out
two
like
the
others
no
please
only
one
are
you
hungry
no
i
not
very
hungry
but
she
too
only
took
one
and
they
peeled
them
carefully
cut
them
up
in
little
pieces
and
tried
to
eat
them
as
slowly
as
possible
his
mother
watched
him
when
he
had
finished
come
take
it
no
mother
but
you
are
ill
i
am
not
ill
but
i
have
eaten
enough
then
his
father
would
reproach
him
with
being
obstinate
and
take
the
last
potato
for
himself
but
learned
that
trick
and
he
used
to
keep
it
on
his
plate
for
ernest
his
little
brother
who
was
always
hungry
and
watched
him
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eyes
from
the
beginning
of
dinner
and
ended
by
asking
are
you
going
to
eat
it
give
it
me
then
oh
how
detested
his
father
how
he
hated
him
for
not
thinking
of
them
or
for
not
even
dreaming
that
he
was
eating
their
share
he
was
so
hungry
that
he
hated
him
and
would
gladly
have
told
him
so
but
he
thought
in
his
pride
that
he
had
no
right
since
he
could
not
earn
his
own
living
his
father
had
earned
the
bread
that
he
took
he
himself
was
good
for
nothing
he
was
a
burden
on
everybody
he
had
no
right
to
talk
later
on
he
would
talk
if
there
were
any
later
on
oh
he
would
die
of
hunger
first
he
suffered
more
than
another
child
would
have
done
from
these
cruel
fasts
his
robust
stomach
was
in
agony
sometimes
he
trembled
because
of
it
his
head
ached
there
was
a
hole
in
his
chest
a
hole
which
turned
and
widened
as
if
a
gimlet
were
being
twisted
in
it
but
he
did
not
complain
he
felt
his
mother
eyes
upon
him
and
assumed
an
expression
of
indifference
louisa
with
a
clutching
at
her
heart
understood
vaguely
that
her
little
boy
was
denying
himself
so
that
the
others
might
have
more
she
rejected
the
idea
but
always
returned
to
it
she
dared
not
investigate
it
or
ask
if
it
were
true
for
if
it
were
true
what
could
she
do
she
had
been
used
to
privation
since
her
childhood
what
is
the
use
of
complaining
when
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
she
never
suspected
indeed
she
with
her
frail
health
and
small
needs
that
the
boy
might
suffer
more
than
herself
she
did
not
say
anything
but
once
or
twice
when
the
others
were
gone
the
children
to
the
street
melchior
about
his
business
she
asked
her
eldest
son
to
stay
to
do
her
some
small
service
would
hold
her
skein
while
she
unwound
it
suddenly
she
would
throw
everything
away
and
draw
him
passionately
to
her
she
would
take
him
on
her
knees
although
he
was
quite
heavy
and
would
hug
and
hug
him
he
would
fling
his
arms
round
her
neck
and
the
two
of
them
would
weep
desperately
embracing
each
other
my
poor
little
boy
mother
mother
they
said
no
more
but
they
understood
each
other
it
was
some
time
before
realized
that
his
father
drank
melchior
intemperance
did
not
at
least
in
the
beginning
exceed
tolerable
limits
it
was
not
brutish
it
showed
itself
rather
by
wild
outbursts
of
happiness
he
used
to
make
foolish
remarks
and
sing
loudly
for
hours
together
as
he
drummed
on
the
table
and
sometimes
he
insisted
on
dancing
with
louisa
and
the
children
saw
that
his
mother
looked
sad
she
would
shrink
back
and
bend
her
face
over
her
work
she
avoided
the
drunkard
eyes
and
used
to
try
gently
to
quiet
him
when
he
said
coarse
things
that
made
her
blush
but
did
not
understand
and
he
was
in
such
need
of
gaiety
that
these
noisy
of
his
father
were
almost
a
festival
to
him
the
house
was
melancholy
and
these
follies
were
a
relaxation
for
him
he
used
to
laugh
heartily
at
melchior
crazy
antics
and
stupid
jokes
he
sang
and
danced
with
him
and
he
was
put
out
when
his
mother
in
an
angry
voice
ordered
him
to
cease
how
could
it
be
wrong
since
his
father
did
it
although
his
ever
keen
observation
which
never
forgot
anything
it
had
seen
told
him
that
there
were
in
his
father
behavior
several
things
which
did
not
accord
with
his
childish
and
imperious
sense
of
justice
yet
he
continued
to
admire
him
a
child
has
so
much
need
of
an
object
of
admiration
doubtless
it
is
one
of
the
eternal
forms
of
when
a
man
is
or
knows
himself
to
be
too
weak
to
accomplish
his
desires
and
satisfy
his
pride
as
a
child
he
transfers
them
to
his
parents
or
as
a
man
who
has
failed
he
transfers
them
to
his
children
they
are
or
shall
be
all
that
he
dreamed
of
being
his
champions
his
avengers
and
in
this
proud
abdication
in
their
favor
love
and
egoism
are
mingled
so
forcefully
and
yet
so
gently
as
to
bring
him
keen
delight
forgot
all
his
grudges
against
his
father
and
cast
about
to
find
reasons
for
admiring
him
he
admired
his
figure
his
strong
arms
his
voice
his
laugh
his
gaiety
and
he
shone
with
pride
when
he
heard
praise
of
his
father
talents
as
a
virtuoso
or
when
melchior
himself
recited
with
some
amplification
the
eulogies
he
had
received
he
believed
in
his
father
boasts
and
looked
upon
him
as
a
genius
as
one
of
his
grandfather
heroes
one
evening
about
seven
he
was
alone
in
the
house
his
little
brothers
had
gone
out
with
jean
michel
louisa
was
washing
the
linen
in
the
river
the
door
opened
and
melchior
plunged
in
he
was
hatless
and
disheveled
he
cut
a
sort
of
caper
to
cross
the
threshold
and
then
plumped
down
in
a
chair
by
the
table
began
to
laugh
thinking
it
was
a
part
of
one
of
the
usual
buffooneries
and
he
approached
him
but
as
soon
as
he
looked
more
closely
at
him
the
desire
to
laugh
left
him
melchior
sat
there
with
his
arms
hanging
and
looking
straight
in
front
of
him
seeing
nothing
with
his
eyes
blinking
his
face
was
crimson
his
mouth
was
open
and
from
it
there
gurgled
every
now
and
then
a
silly
laugh
stood
he
thought
at
first
that
his
father
was
joking
but
when
he
saw
that
he
did
not
budge
he
was
papa
papa
he
cried
melchior
went
on
gobbling
like
a
fowl
took
him
by
the
arm
in
despair
and
shook
him
with
all
his
strength
papa
dear
papa
answer
me
please
please
melchior
body
shook
like
a
boneless
thing
and
all
but
fell
his
head
flopped
towards
he
looked
at
him
and
babbled
incoherently
and
irritably
when
eyes
met
those
clouded
eyes
he
was
seized
with
panic
terror
he
ran
away
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
threw
himself
on
his
knees
by
the
bed
and
buried
his
face
in
the
clothes
he
remained
so
for
some
time
melchior
swung
heavily
on
the
chair
sniggering
stopped
his
ears
so
as
not
to
hear
him
and
trembled
what
was
happening
within
him
was
inexpressible
it
was
a
terrible
upheaval
terror
sorrow
as
though
for
some
one
dead
some
one
dear
and
honored
no
one
came
they
were
left
alone
night
fell
and
fear
grew
as
the
minutes
passed
he
could
not
help
listening
and
his
blood
froze
as
he
heard
the
voice
that
he
did
not
recognize
the
silence
made
it
all
the
more
terrifying
the
limping
clock
beat
time
for
the
senseless
babbling
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
he
wished
to
fly
but
he
had
to
pass
his
father
to
get
out
and
shuddered
at
the
idea
of
seeing
those
eyes
again
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
must
die
if
he
did
he
tried
to
creep
on
hands
and
knees
to
the
door
of
the
room
he
could
not
breathe
he
would
not
look
he
stopped
at
the
least
movement
from
melchior
whose
feet
he
could
see
under
the
table
one
of
the
drunken
man
legs
trembled
reached
the
door
with
one
trembling
hand
he
pushed
the
handle
but
in
his
terror
he
let
go
it
shut
to
again
melchior
turned
to
look
the
chair
on
which
he
was
balanced
toppled
over
he
fell
down
with
a
crash
in
his
terror
had
no
strength
left
for
flight
he
remained
glued
to
the
wall
looking
at
his
father
stretched
there
at
his
feet
and
he
cried
for
help
his
fall
sobered
melchior
a
little
he
cursed
and
swore
and
thumped
on
the
chair
that
had
played
him
such
a
trick
he
tried
vainly
to
get
up
and
then
did
manage
to
sit
up
with
his
back
resting
against
the
table
and
he
recognized
his
surroundings
he
saw
crying
he
called
him
wanted
to
run
away
he
could
not
stir
melchior
called
him
again
and
as
the
child
did
not
come
he
swore
angrily
went
near
him
trembling
in
every
limb
melchior
drew
the
boy
near
him
and
made
him
sit
on
his
knees
he
began
by
pulling
his
ears
and
in
a
thick
stuttering
voice
delivered
a
homily
on
the
respect
due
from
a
son
to
his
father
then
he
went
off
suddenly
on
a
new
train
of
thought
and
made
him
jump
in
his
arms
while
he
rattled
off
silly
jokes
he
wriggled
with
laughter
from
that
he
passed
immediately
to
melancholy
ideas
he
commiserated
the
boy
and
himself
he
hugged
him
so
that
he
was
like
to
choke
covered
him
with
kisses
and
tears
and
finally
rocked
him
in
his
arms
intoning
the
made
no
effort
to
break
loose
he
was
frozen
with
horror
stifled
against
his
father
bosom
feeling
his
breath
hiccoughing
and
smelling
of
wine
upon
his
face
wet
with
his
kisses
and
repulsive
tears
he
was
in
an
agony
of
fear
and
disgust
he
would
have
screamed
but
no
sound
would
come
from
his
lips
he
remained
in
this
horrible
condition
for
an
age
as
it
seemed
to
him
until
the
door
opened
and
louisa
came
in
with
a
basket
of
linen
on
her
arm
she
gave
a
cry
let
the
basket
fall
rushed
at
and
with
a
violence
which
seemed
incredible
in
her
she
wrenched
melchior
arm
crying
drunken
drunken
wretch
her
eyes
flashed
with
anger
thought
his
father
was
going
to
kill
her
but
melchior
was
so
startled
by
the
threatening
appearance
of
his
wife
that
he
made
no
reply
and
began
to
weep
he
rolled
on
the
floor
he
beat
his
head
against
the
furniture
and
said
that
she
was
right
that
he
was
a
drunkard
that
he
brought
misery
upon
his
family
and
was
ruining
his
poor
children
and
wished
he
were
dead
louisa
had
contemptuously
turned
her
back
on
him
she
carried
into
the
next
room
and
caressed
him
and
tried
to
comfort
him
the
boy
went
on
trembling
and
did
not
answer
his
questions
then
he
burst
out
sobbing
louisa
bathed
his
face
with
water
she
kissed
him
and
used
tender
words
and
wept
with
him
in
the
end
they
were
both
comforted
she
knelt
and
made
him
kneel
by
her
side
they
prayed
to
god
to
cure
father
of
his
disgusting
habit
and
make
him
the
kind
good
man
that
he
used
to
be
louisa
put
the
child
to
bed
he
wanted
her
to
stay
by
his
bedside
and
hold
his
hand
louisa
spent
part
of
the
night
sitting
on
bed
he
was
feverish
the
drunken
man
snored
on
the
floor
some
time
after
that
one
day
at
school
when
was
spending
his
time
watching
the
flies
on
the
ceiling
and
thumping
his
neighbors
to
make
them
fall
off
the
form
the
schoolmaster
who
had
taken
a
dislike
to
him
because
he
was
always
fidgeting
and
laughing
and
would
never
learn
anything
made
an
unhappy
allusion
had
fallen
down
himself
and
the
schoolmaster
said
he
seemed
to
be
like
to
follow
brilliantly
in
the
footsteps
of
a
certain
person
all
the
boys
burst
out
laughing
and
some
of
them
took
upon
themselves
to
point
the
allusion
with
comment
both
lucid
and
vigorous
got
up
livid
with
shame
seized
his
and
hurled
it
with
all
his
strength
at
the
nearest
boy
whom
he
saw
laughing
the
schoolmaster
fell
on
him
and
beat
him
he
was
thrashed
made
to
kneel
and
set
to
do
an
enormous
imposition
he
went
home
pale
and
storming
though
he
said
never
a
word
he
declared
frigidly
that
he
would
not
go
to
school
again
they
paid
no
attention
to
what
he
said
next
morning
when
his
mother
reminded
him
that
it
was
time
to
go
he
replied
quietly
that
he
had
said
that
he
was
not
going
any
more
in
rain
louisa
begged
and
screamed
and
threatened
it
was
no
use
he
stayed
sitting
in
his
corner
obstinate
melchior
thrashed
him
he
howled
but
every
time
they
bade
him
go
after
the
thrashing
was
over
he
replied
angrily
no
they
asked
him
at
least
to
say
why
he
clenched
his
teeth
and
would
not
melchior
took
hold
of
him
carried
him
to
school
and
gave
him
into
the
master
charge
they
set
him
on
his
form
and
he
began
methodically
to
break
everything
within
reach
his
inkstand
his
pen
he
tore
up
his
and
all
quite
openly
with
his
eye
on
the
schoolmaster
provocative
they
shut
him
up
in
a
dark
room
a
few
moments
later
the
schoolmaster
found
him
with
his
handkerchief
tied
round
his
neck
tugging
with
all
his
strength
at
the
two
ends
of
it
he
was
trying
to
strangle
himself
they
had
to
send
him
back
was
impervious
to
sickness
he
had
inherited
from
his
father
and
grandfather
their
robust
constitutions
they
were
not
mollycoddles
in
that
family
well
or
ill
they
never
worried
and
nothing
could
bring
about
any
change
in
the
habits
of
the
two
kraffts
father
and
son
they
went
out
winter
and
summer
in
all
weathers
and
stayed
for
hours
together
out
in
rain
or
sun
sometimes
bareheaded
and
with
their
coats
open
from
carelessness
or
bravado
and
walked
for
miles
without
being
tired
and
they
looked
with
pity
and
disdain
upon
poor
louisa
who
never
said
anything
but
had
to
stop
she
would
go
pale
and
her
legs
would
swell
and
her
heart
would
thump
was
not
far
from
sharing
the
scorn
of
his
mother
he
did
not
understand
people
being
ill
when
he
fell
or
knocked
himself
or
cut
himself
or
burned
himself
he
did
not
cry
but
he
was
angry
with
the
thing
that
had
injured
him
his
brutalities
and
the
roughness
of
his
little
playmates
the
urchins
of
the
street
with
whom
he
used
to
fight
hardened
him
he
was
not
afraid
of
blows
and
more
than
once
he
returned
home
with
bleeding
nose
and
bruised
forehead
one
day
he
had
to
be
wrenched
away
almost
suffocated
from
one
of
these
fierce
tussles
in
which
he
had
bowled
over
his
adversary
who
was
savagely
banging
his
head
on
the
ground
that
seemed
natural
enough
to
him
for
he
was
prepared
to
do
unto
others
as
they
did
unto
himself
and
yet
he
was
afraid
of
all
sorts
of
things
and
although
no
one
knew
it
for
he
was
very
proud
nothing
brought
him
go
much
suffering
during
a
part
of
his
childhood
as
these
same
terrors
for
two
or
three
years
especially
they
gnawed
at
him
like
a
disease
he
was
afraid
of
the
mysterious
something
that
lurks
in
darkness
evil
powers
that
seemed
to
lie
in
wait
for
his
life
the
roaring
of
monsters
which
fearfully
haunt
the
mind
of
every
child
and
appear
in
everything
that
he
sees
the
relic
perhaps
of
a
form
long
dead
hallucinations
of
the
first
days
after
emerging
from
chaos
from
the
fearful
slumber
in
his
womb
from
the
awakening
of
the
larva
from
the
depths
of
matter
he
was
afraid
of
the
garret
door
it
opened
on
to
the
stairs
and
was
almost
always
ajar
when
he
had
to
pass
it
he
felt
his
heart
heating
he
would
spring
forward
and
jump
by
it
without
looking
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
some
one
or
something
behind
it
when
it
was
closed
he
heard
distinctly
something
moving
behind
it
that
was
not
surprising
for
there
were
large
rats
but
he
imagined
a
monster
with
rattling
bones
and
flesh
hanging
in
rags
a
horse
head
horrible
and
terrifying
eyes
shapeless
he
did
not
want
to
think
of
it
but
did
so
in
spite
of
himself
with
trembling
hand
he
would
make
sure
that
the
door
was
locked
but
that
did
not
keep
him
from
turning
round
ten
times
as
he
went
downstairs
he
was
afraid
of
the
night
outside
sometimes
he
used
to
stay
late
with
his
grandfather
or
was
sent
out
in
the
evening
on
some
errand
old
krafft
lived
a
little
outside
the
town
in
the
last
house
on
the
cologne
road
between
the
house
and
the
first
lighted
windows
of
the
town
there
was
a
distance
of
two
or
three
hundred
yards
which
seemed
three
times
as
long
to
there
were
places
where
the
road
twisted
and
it
was
impossible
to
see
anything
the
country
was
deserted
in
the
evening
the
earth
grew
black
and
the
sky
was
awfully
pale
when
he
came
out
from
the
hedges
that
lined
the
road
and
climbed
up
the
slope
he
could
still
see
a
yellowish
gleam
on
the
horizon
but
it
gave
no
light
and
was
more
oppressive
than
the
night
it
made
the
darkness
only
darker
it
was
a
deathly
light
the
clouds
came
down
almost
to
earth
the
hedges
grew
enormous
and
moved
the
gaunt
trees
were
like
grotesque
old
men
the
sides
of
the
wood
were
stark
white
the
darkness
moved
there
were
dwarfs
sitting
in
the
ditches
lights
in
the
grass
fearful
flying
things
in
the
air
shrill
cries
of
insects
coming
from
nowhere
was
always
in
anguish
expecting
some
fearsome
or
strange
putting
forth
of
nature
he
would
run
with
his
heart
leaping
in
his
bosom
when
he
saw
the
light
in
his
grandfather
room
he
would
gain
confidence
but
worst
of
all
was
when
old
krafft
was
not
at
home
that
was
most
terrifying
the
old
house
lost
in
the
country
frightened
the
boy
even
in
daylight
he
forgot
his
fears
when
his
grandfather
was
there
but
sometimes
the
old
man
would
leave
him
alone
and
go
out
without
warning
him
did
not
mind
that
the
room
was
quiet
everything
in
it
was
familiar
and
kindly
there
was
a
great
white
wooden
bedstead
by
the
bedside
was
a
great
bible
on
a
shelf
artificial
flowers
were
on
the
mantelpiece
with
photographs
of
the
old
man
two
wives
and
eleven
children
and
at
the
bottom
of
each
photograph
he
had
written
the
date
of
birth
and
death
on
the
walls
were
framed
texts
and
vile
chromolithographs
of
mozart
and
beethoven
a
little
piano
stood
in
one
corner
a
great
violoncello
in
another
rows
of
books
pipes
and
in
the
window
pots
of
geraniums
it
was
like
being
surrounded
with
friends
the
old
man
could
be
heard
moving
about
in
the
next
room
and
planing
or
hammering
and
talking
to
himself
calling
himself
an
idiot
or
singing
in
a
loud
voice
improvising
a
of
scraps
of
chants
and
sentimental
warlike
marches
and
drinking
songs
here
was
shelter
and
refuge
would
sit
in
the
great
armchair
by
the
window
with
a
book
on
his
knees
bending
over
the
pictures
and
losing
himself
in
them
the
day
would
die
down
his
eyes
would
grow
weary
and
then
he
would
look
no
more
and
fall
into
vague
dreaming
the
wheels
of
a
cart
would
rumble
by
along
the
road
a
cow
would
moo
in
the
fields
the
bells
of
the
town
weary
and
sleepy
would
ring
the
evening
angelus
vague
desires
happy
presentiments
would
awake
in
the
heart
of
the
dreaming
child
suddenly
would
awake
filled
with
dull
uneasiness
he
would
raise
his
eyes
night
he
would
listen
silence
his
grandfather
had
just
gone
out
he
shuddered
he
leaned
out
of
the
window
to
try
to
see
him
the
road
was
deserted
things
began
to
take
on
a
threatening
aspect
oh
god
if
should
be
coming
what
he
could
not
tell
the
fearful
thing
the
doors
were
not
properly
shut
the
wooden
stairs
creaked
as
under
a
footstep
the
boy
leaped
up
dragged
the
armchair
the
two
chairs
and
the
table
to
the
most
remote
corner
of
the
room
he
made
a
barrier
of
them
the
armchair
against
the
wall
a
chair
to
the
right
a
chair
to
the
left
and
the
table
in
front
of
him
in
the
middle
he
planted
a
pair
of
steps
and
perched
on
top
with
his
book
and
other
books
like
provisions
against
a
siege
he
breathed
again
having
decided
in
his
childish
imagination
that
the
enemy
could
not
pass
the
barrier
that
was
not
to
be
allowed
but
the
enemy
would
creep
forth
even
from
his
book
among
the
old
books
which
the
old
man
had
picked
up
were
some
with
pictures
which
made
a
profound
impression
on
the
child
they
attracted
and
yet
terrified
him
there
were
fantastic
visions
temptations
of
anthony
in
which
skeletons
of
birds
hung
in
bottles
and
thousands
of
eggs
writhe
like
worms
in
disemboweled
frogs
and
heads
walk
on
feet
and
asses
play
trumpets
and
household
utensils
and
corpses
of
animals
walk
gravely
wrapped
in
great
cloths
bowing
like
old
ladies
was
horrified
by
them
but
always
returned
to
them
drawn
on
by
disgust
he
would
look
at
them
for
a
long
time
and
every
now
and
then
look
furtively
about
him
to
see
what
was
stirring
in
the
folds
of
the
curtains
a
picture
of
a
flayed
man
in
an
anatomy
book
was
still
more
horrible
to
him
he
trembled
as
he
turned
the
page
when
he
came
to
the
place
where
it
was
in
the
book
this
shapeless
medley
was
grimly
etched
for
him
the
creative
power
inherent
in
every
child
mind
filled
out
the
meagerness
of
the
setting
of
them
he
saw
no
difference
between
the
daubs
and
the
reality
at
night
they
had
an
even
more
powerful
influence
over
his
dreams
than
the
living
things
that
he
saw
during
the
day
he
was
afraid
to
sleep
for
several
years
nightmares
poisoned
his
rest
he
wandered
in
cellars
and
through
the
manhole
saw
the
grinning
flayed
man
entering
he
was
alone
in
a
room
and
he
heard
a
stealthy
footstep
in
the
corridor
he
hurled
himself
against
the
door
to
close
it
and
was
just
in
time
to
hold
the
handle
but
it
was
turned
from
the
outside
he
could
not
turn
the
key
his
strength
left
him
and
he
cried
for
help
he
was
with
his
family
and
suddenly
their
faces
changed
they
did
crazy
things
he
was
reading
quietly
and
he
felt
that
an
invisible
being
was
all
him
he
tried
to
fly
but
felt
himself
bound
he
tried
to
cry
out
but
he
was
gagged
a
loathsome
grip
was
about
his
neck
he
awoke
suffocating
and
with
his
teeth
chattering
and
he
went
on
trembling
long
after
he
was
awake
he
could
not
be
rid
of
his
agony
the
roam
in
which
he
slept
was
a
hole
without
door
or
windows
an
old
curtain
hung
up
by
a
over
the
entrance
was
all
that
separated
it
from
the
room
of
his
father
and
mother
the
thick
air
stifled
him
his
brother
who
slept
in
the
same
bed
used
to
kick
him
his
head
burned
and
he
was
a
prey
to
a
sort
of
hallucination
in
which
all
the
little
troubles
of
the
day
reappeared
infinitely
magnified
in
this
state
of
nervous
tension
bordering
on
delirium
the
least
shock
was
an
agony
to
him
the
creaking
of
a
plank
terrified
him
his
father
breathing
took
on
fantastic
proportions
it
seemed
to
be
no
longer
a
human
breathing
and
the
monstrous
sound
was
horrible
to
him
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
must
be
a
beast
sleeping
there
the
night
crushed
him
it
would
never
end
it
must
always
be
so
he
was
lying
there
for
months
and
months
he
gasped
for
breath
he
half
raised
himself
on
his
bed
sat
up
dried
his
sweating
face
with
his
sometimes
he
nudged
his
brother
rodolphe
to
wake
him
up
but
rodolphe
moaned
drew
away
from
him
the
rest
of
the
bedclothes
and
went
on
sleeping
so
he
stayed
in
feverish
agony
until
a
pale
beam
of
light
appeared
on
the
floor
below
the
curtain
this
timorous
paleness
of
the
distant
dawn
suddenly
brought
him
peace
he
felt
the
light
gliding
into
the
room
when
it
was
still
impossible
to
distinguish
it
from
darkness
then
his
fever
would
die
down
his
blood
would
grow
calm
like
a
flooded
river
returning
to
its
bed
an
even
warmth
would
flow
through
all
his
body
and
his
eyes
burning
from
sleeplessness
would
close
in
spite
of
himself
in
the
evening
it
was
terrible
to
him
to
see
the
approach
of
the
hour
of
sleep
he
vowed
that
he
would
not
give
way
to
it
to
watch
the
whole
night
through
fearing
his
nightmares
but
in
the
end
weariness
always
overcame
him
and
it
was
always
when
he
was
least
on
his
guard
that
the
monsters
returned
fearful
night
so
sweet
to
most
children
so
terrible
to
some
he
was
afraid
to
sleep
he
was
afraid
of
not
sleeping
waking
or
sleeping
he
was
surrounded
by
monstrous
shapes
the
phantoms
of
his
own
brain
the
larvæ
floating
in
the
and
twilight
of
childhood
as
in
the
dark
chiaroscuro
of
sickness
but
these
fancied
terrors
were
soon
to
be
blotted
out
in
the
great
fear
that
which
is
in
the
hearts
of
all
men
that
fear
which
wisdom
does
in
vain
preen
itself
on
forgetting
or
denying
death
one
day
when
he
was
rummaging
in
a
cupboard
he
came
upon
several
things
that
he
did
not
know
a
child
frock
and
a
striped
bonnet
he
took
them
in
triumph
to
his
mother
who
instead
of
smiling
at
him
looked
vexed
and
bade
him
take
them
back
to
the
place
where
he
had
found
them
when
he
hesitated
to
obey
and
asked
her
why
she
snatched
them
from
him
without
reply
and
put
them
on
a
shelf
where
he
could
not
reach
them
roused
to
curiosity
he
plied
her
with
questions
at
last
she
told
him
that
there
had
been
a
little
brother
who
had
died
before
came
into
the
world
he
was
taken
aback
he
had
never
heard
tell
of
him
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
tried
to
find
out
more
his
mother
seemed
to
be
lost
in
thought
but
she
told
him
that
the
little
brother
was
called
like
himself
but
was
more
sensible
he
put
more
questions
to
her
but
she
would
not
reply
readily
she
told
him
only
that
his
brother
was
in
heaven
and
was
praying
for
them
all
could
get
no
more
out
of
her
she
bade
him
be
quiet
and
to
let
her
go
on
with
her
work
she
seemed
to
be
absorbed
in
her
sewing
she
looked
anxious
and
did
not
raise
her
eyes
but
after
some
time
she
looked
at
him
where
he
was
in
the
corner
whither
he
had
retired
to
sulk
began
to
smile
and
told
him
to
go
and
play
outside
these
scraps
of
conversation
profoundly
agitated
there
had
been
a
child
a
little
boy
belonging
to
his
mother
like
himself
bearing
the
same
name
almost
exactly
the
same
and
he
was
dead
dead
he
did
not
exactly
know
what
that
was
but
it
was
something
terrible
and
they
never
talked
of
this
other
he
was
quite
forgotten
it
would
be
the
same
with
him
if
he
were
to
die
this
thought
was
with
him
still
in
the
evening
at
table
with
his
family
when
he
saw
them
all
laughing
and
talking
of
trifles
so
then
it
was
possible
that
they
would
be
gay
after
he
was
dead
oh
he
never
would
have
believed
that
his
mother
could
be
selfish
enough
to
laugh
after
the
death
of
her
little
boy
he
hated
them
all
he
wanted
to
weep
for
himself
for
his
own
death
in
advance
at
the
same
time
he
wanted
to
ask
a
whole
heap
of
questions
but
he
dared
not
he
remembered
the
voice
in
which
his
mother
had
bid
him
be
quiet
at
last
he
could
contain
himself
no
longer
and
one
night
when
he
had
gone
to
bed
and
louisa
came
to
kiss
him
he
asked
mother
did
he
sleep
in
my
bed
the
poor
woman
trembled
and
trying
to
take
on
an
indifferent
tone
of
voice
she
asked
who
the
little
boy
who
is
dead
said
in
a
whisper
his
mother
clutched
him
with
her
hands
be
quiet
quiet
she
said
her
voice
trembled
whose
head
was
leaning
against
her
bosom
heard
her
heart
beating
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
then
she
said
you
must
never
talk
of
that
my
dear
go
to
sleep
no
it
was
not
his
bed
she
kissed
him
he
thought
he
felt
her
cheek
wet
against
his
he
wished
he
could
have
been
sure
of
it
he
was
a
little
comforted
there
was
grief
in
her
then
then
he
doubted
it
again
the
next
moment
when
he
heard
her
in
the
next
room
talking
in
a
quiet
ordinary
voice
which
was
true
that
or
what
had
just
been
he
turned
about
for
long
in
his
bed
without
finding
any
answer
he
wanted
his
mother
to
suffer
not
that
he
also
did
not
suffer
in
the
knowledge
that
she
was
sad
but
it
would
have
done
him
so
much
good
in
spite
of
everything
he
would
have
felt
himself
less
alone
he
slept
and
next
day
thought
no
more
of
it
some
weeks
afterwards
one
of
the
urchins
with
whom
he
played
in
the
street
did
not
come
at
the
usual
time
one
of
them
said
that
he
was
ill
and
they
got
used
to
not
seeing
him
in
their
games
it
was
explained
it
was
quite
simple
one
evening
had
gone
to
bed
it
was
early
and
from
the
recess
in
which
his
bed
was
he
saw
the
light
in
the
room
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
a
neighbor
had
come
to
have
a
chat
he
listened
absently
telling
himself
stories
as
usual
the
words
of
their
talk
did
not
reach
him
suddenly
he
heard
the
neighbor
say
he
is
dead
his
blood
stopped
for
he
had
understood
who
was
dead
he
listened
and
held
his
breath
his
parents
cried
out
melchior
booming
voice
said
do
you
hear
poor
fritz
is
dead
made
an
effort
and
replied
quietly
yes
papa
his
bosom
was
drawn
tight
as
in
a
vise
melchior
went
on
papa
is
that
all
you
say
you
are
not
grieved
by
it
louisa
who
understood
the
child
said
let
him
sleep
and
they
talked
in
whispers
but
pricking
his
ears
gathered
all
the
details
of
illness
typhoid
fever
cold
baths
delirium
the
parents
grief
he
could
not
breathe
a
lump
in
his
throat
choked
him
he
shuddered
all
these
horrible
things
took
shape
in
his
mind
above
all
he
gleaned
that
the
disease
was
contagious
that
is
that
he
also
might
die
in
the
same
way
and
terror
froze
him
for
he
remembered
that
he
had
shaken
hands
with
fritz
the
last
time
he
had
seen
him
and
that
very
day
had
gone
past
the
house
but
he
made
no
sound
so
as
to
avoid
having
to
talk
and
when
his
father
after
the
neighbor
had
gone
asked
him
are
you
asleep
he
did
not
reply
he
heard
melchior
saying
to
louisa
the
boy
has
no
heart
louisa
did
not
reply
but
a
moment
later
she
came
and
gently
raised
the
curtain
and
looked
at
the
little
bed
only
just
had
time
to
close
his
eyes
and
imitate
the
regular
breathing
which
his
brothers
made
when
they
were
asleep
louisa
went
away
on
and
yet
how
he
wanted
to
keep
her
how
he
wanted
to
tell
her
that
he
was
afraid
and
to
ask
her
to
save
him
or
at
least
to
comfort
him
but
he
was
afraid
of
their
laughing
at
him
and
treating
him
as
a
coward
and
besides
he
knew
only
too
well
that
nothing
that
they
might
say
would
be
any
good
and
for
hours
he
lay
there
in
agony
thinking
that
he
felt
the
disease
creeping
over
him
and
pains
in
his
head
a
stricture
of
the
heart
and
thinking
in
terror
it
is
the
end
i
am
ill
i
am
going
to
die
i
am
going
to
die
once
he
sat
up
in
his
bed
and
called
to
his
mother
in
a
low
voice
but
they
were
asleep
and
he
dared
not
wake
them
from
that
time
on
his
childhood
was
poisoned
by
the
idea
of
death
his
nerves
delivered
him
up
to
all
sorts
of
little
baseless
sicknesses
to
depression
to
sudden
transports
and
fits
of
choking
his
imagination
ran
riot
with
these
troubles
and
thought
it
saw
in
all
of
them
the
murderous
beast
which
was
to
rob
him
of
his
life
how
many
times
he
suffered
agonies
with
his
mother
sitting
only
a
few
yards
away
from
him
and
she
guessing
nothing
for
in
his
cowardice
he
was
brave
enough
to
conceal
all
his
terror
in
a
strange
jumble
of
feeling
pride
in
not
turning
to
others
shame
of
being
afraid
and
the
scrupulousness
of
a
tenderness
which
forbade
him
to
trouble
his
mother
but
he
never
ceased
to
think
this
time
i
am
ill
i
am
seriously
ill
it
is
diphtheria
he
had
chanced
on
the
word
dear
god
not
this
time
he
had
religious
ideas
he
loved
to
believe
what
his
mother
had
told
him
that
after
death
the
soul
ascended
to
the
lord
and
if
it
were
pious
entered
into
the
garden
of
paradise
but
the
idea
of
this
journey
rather
frightened
than
attracted
him
he
was
not
at
all
envious
of
the
children
whom
god
as
a
recompense
according
to
his
mother
took
in
their
sleep
and
called
to
him
without
having
made
them
suffer
he
trembled
as
he
went
to
sleep
for
fear
that
god
should
indulge
this
whimsy
at
his
expense
it
must
be
terrible
to
be
taken
suddenly
from
the
warmth
of
one
bed
and
dragged
through
the
void
into
the
presence
of
god
he
imagined
god
as
an
enormous
sun
with
a
voice
of
thunder
how
it
must
hurt
it
must
barn
the
eyes
ears
all
one
soul
then
god
could
punish
you
never
know
and
besides
that
did
not
prevent
all
the
other
horrors
which
he
did
not
know
very
well
though
he
could
guess
them
from
what
he
had
heard
your
body
in
a
box
all
alone
at
the
bottom
of
a
hole
lost
in
the
crowd
of
those
revolting
cemeteries
to
which
he
was
taken
to
pray
god
god
how
sad
how
sad
and
yet
it
was
not
exactly
joyous
to
live
and
be
hungry
and
see
your
father
drunk
and
to
be
beaten
to
suffer
in
so
many
ways
from
the
wickedness
of
other
children
from
the
insulting
pity
of
persons
and
to
be
understood
by
no
one
not
even
by
your
mother
everybody
humiliates
you
no
one
loves
you
you
are
alone
alone
and
matter
so
little
yes
but
it
was
just
this
that
made
him
want
to
live
he
felt
in
himself
a
surging
power
of
wrath
a
strange
thing
that
power
it
could
do
nothing
yet
it
was
as
though
it
were
afar
off
and
gagged
swaddled
paralyzed
he
had
no
idea
what
it
wanted
what
later
on
it
would
be
but
it
was
in
him
he
was
sure
of
it
he
felt
it
stirring
and
crying
out
what
a
voyage
he
would
take
he
had
a
savage
desire
to
live
to
punish
the
wicked
to
do
great
things
oh
but
how
i
will
live
when
i
am
he
pondered
a
little
when
i
am
eighteen
sometimes
he
put
it
at
that
was
the
extreme
limit
he
thought
that
was
enough
for
the
domination
of
the
world
he
thought
of
the
heroes
dearest
to
him
of
napoleon
and
of
that
other
more
remote
hero
whom
he
preferred
alexander
the
great
surely
he
would
be
like
them
if
only
he
lived
for
another
twelve
ten
years
he
never
thought
of
pitying
those
who
died
at
thirty
they
were
old
they
had
lived
their
lives
it
was
their
fault
if
they
hat
failed
but
to
die
now
despair
too
terrible
to
pass
while
yet
a
little
child
and
forever
to
be
in
the
minds
of
men
a
little
boy
whom
everybody
thinks
he
has
the
right
to
scold
he
wept
with
rage
at
the
thought
as
though
he
were
already
dead
this
agony
of
death
tortured
his
childish
years
corrected
only
by
disgust
with
all
life
and
the
sadness
of
his
own
it
was
in
the
midst
of
these
gloomy
shadows
in
the
stifling
night
that
every
moment
seemed
to
intensify
about
him
that
there
began
to
shine
like
a
star
lost
in
the
dark
abysm
of
space
the
light
which
was
to
illuminate
his
life
divine
music
his
grandfather
gave
the
children
an
old
piano
which
one
of
his
clients
anxious
to
be
rid
of
it
had
asked
him
to
take
his
patient
ingenuity
had
almost
put
it
in
order
the
present
had
not
been
very
well
received
louisa
thought
her
room
already
too
small
without
filling
it
up
any
more
and
melchior
said
that
jean
michel
had
not
ruined
himself
over
it
just
firewood
only
was
glad
of
it
without
exactly
knowing
why
it
seemed
to
him
a
magic
box
full
of
marvelous
stories
just
like
the
ones
in
the
a
volume
of
the
thousand
and
one
nights
which
his
grandfather
read
to
him
sometimes
to
their
mutual
delight
he
had
heard
his
father
try
the
piano
on
the
day
of
its
arrival
and
draw
from
it
a
little
rain
of
arpeggios
like
the
drops
that
a
puff
of
wind
shakes
from
the
wet
branches
of
a
tree
after
a
shower
he
clapped
his
hands
and
cried
encore
but
melchior
scornfully
closed
the
piano
saying
that
it
was
worthless
did
not
insist
but
after
that
he
was
always
hovering
about
the
instrument
as
soon
as
no
one
was
near
he
would
raise
the
lid
and
softly
press
down
a
key
just
as
if
he
were
moving
with
his
finger
the
living
shell
of
some
great
insect
he
wanted
to
push
out
the
creature
that
was
locked
up
in
it
sometimes
in
his
haste
he
would
strike
too
hard
and
then
his
mother
would
cry
out
will
you
not
be
quiet
go
touching
everything
or
else
he
would
pinch
himself
cruelly
in
closing
the
piano
and
make
piteous
faces
as
he
sucked
his
bruised
fingers
now
his
greatest
joy
is
when
his
mother
is
gone
out
for
a
day
service
or
to
pay
some
visit
in
the
town
he
listens
as
she
goes
down
the
stairs
and
into
the
street
and
away
he
is
alone
he
opens
the
piano
and
brings
up
a
chair
and
perches
on
it
his
shoulders
just
about
reach
the
keyboard
it
is
enough
for
what
he
wants
why
does
he
wait
until
he
is
alone
no
one
would
prevent
his
playing
so
long
as
he
did
not
make
too
much
noise
but
he
is
ashamed
before
the
others
and
dare
not
and
then
they
talk
and
move
about
that
spoils
his
pleasure
it
is
so
much
more
beautiful
when
he
is
alone
holds
his
breath
so
that
the
silence
may
be
even
greater
and
also
because
he
is
a
little
excited
as
though
he
were
going
to
let
off
a
gun
his
heart
beats
as
he
lays
his
finger
on
the
key
sometimes
he
lifts
his
finger
after
he
has
the
key
half
pressed
down
and
lays
it
on
another
does
he
know
what
will
come
out
of
it
more
than
what
will
come
out
of
the
other
suddenly
a
sound
issues
from
it
there
are
deep
sounds
and
high
sounds
some
tinkling
some
roaring
the
child
listens
to
them
one
by
one
as
they
die
away
and
finally
cease
to
be
they
hover
in
the
air
like
bells
heard
far
off
coming
near
in
the
wind
and
then
going
away
again
then
when
you
listen
you
hear
in
the
distance
other
voices
different
joining
in
and
droning
like
flying
insects
they
seem
to
call
to
you
to
draw
you
away
farther
farther
and
farther
into
the
mysterious
regions
where
they
dive
down
and
are
lost
they
are
gone
no
still
they
murmur
a
little
beating
of
wings
how
strange
it
all
is
they
are
like
spirits
how
is
it
that
they
are
so
obedient
how
is
it
that
they
are
held
captive
in
this
old
box
but
best
of
all
is
when
you
lay
two
fingers
on
two
keys
at
once
then
you
never
know
exactly
what
will
happen
sometimes
the
two
spirits
are
hostile
they
are
angry
with
each
other
and
fight
and
hate
each
other
and
buzz
testily
then
voices
are
raised
they
cry
out
angrily
now
sorrowfully
adores
that
it
is
as
though
there
were
monsters
chained
up
biting
at
their
fetters
beating
against
the
bars
of
their
prison
they
are
like
to
break
them
and
burst
out
like
the
monsters
in
the
the
genii
imprisoned
in
the
arab
bottles
under
the
seal
of
solomon
others
flatter
you
they
try
to
cajole
you
but
you
feel
that
they
only
want
to
bite
that
they
are
hot
and
fevered
does
not
know
what
they
want
but
they
lure
him
and
disturb
him
they
make
him
almost
blush
and
sometimes
there
are
notes
that
love
each
other
sounds
embrace
as
people
do
with
their
arms
when
they
kiss
they
are
gracious
and
sweet
these
are
the
good
spirits
their
faces
are
smiling
and
there
are
no
lines
in
them
they
love
little
and
little
loves
them
tears
come
to
his
eyes
as
he
hears
them
and
he
is
never
weary
of
calling
them
up
they
are
his
friends
his
dear
tender
friends
so
the
child
journeys
through
the
forest
of
sounds
and
round
him
he
is
conscious
of
thousands
of
forces
lying
in
wait
for
him
and
calling
to
him
to
caress
or
devour
him
one
day
melchior
came
upon
him
thus
he
made
him
jump
with
fear
at
the
sound
of
his
great
voice
thinking
he
was
doing
wrong
quickly
put
his
hands
up
to
his
ears
to
ward
off
the
blows
he
feared
but
melchior
did
not
scold
him
strange
to
say
he
was
in
a
good
temper
and
laughed
you
like
that
boy
he
asked
patting
his
head
kindly
would
you
like
me
to
teach
you
to
play
it
would
he
like
delighted
he
murmured
yes
the
two
of
them
sat
down
at
the
piano
perched
this
time
on
a
pile
of
big
books
and
very
attentively
he
took
his
first
lesson
he
learned
first
of
all
that
the
buzzing
spirits
have
strange
names
like
chinese
names
of
one
syllable
or
even
of
one
letter
he
was
astonished
he
imagined
them
to
be
different
from
that
beautiful
caressing
names
like
the
princesses
in
the
fairy
stories
he
did
not
like
the
familiarity
with
which
his
father
talked
of
them
again
when
melchior
evoked
them
they
were
not
the
same
they
seemed
to
become
indifferent
as
they
rolled
out
from
under
his
fingers
but
was
glad
to
learn
about
the
relationships
between
them
their
hierarchy
the
scales
which
were
like
a
king
commanding
an
army
or
like
a
band
of
negroes
marching
in
single
file
he
was
surprised
to
see
that
each
soldier
or
each
negro
could
become
a
monarch
in
his
turn
or
the
head
of
a
similar
band
and
that
it
was
possible
to
summon
whole
battalions
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
the
keyboard
it
amused
him
to
hold
the
thread
which
made
them
march
but
it
was
a
small
thing
compared
with
what
he
had
seen
at
first
his
enchanted
forest
was
lost
however
he
set
himself
to
learn
for
it
was
not
tiresome
and
he
was
surprised
at
his
father
patience
melchior
did
not
weary
of
it
either
he
made
him
begin
the
same
thing
over
again
ten
times
did
not
understand
why
he
should
take
so
much
trouble
his
father
loved
him
then
that
was
good
the
boy
worked
away
his
heart
was
filled
with
gratitude
he
would
have
been
less
docile
had
he
known
what
thoughts
were
springing
into
being
in
his
father
head
from
that
day
on
melchior
took
him
to
the
house
of
a
neighbor
where
three
times
a
week
there
was
chamber
music
melchior
played
first
violin
jean
michel
the
violoncello
the
other
two
were
a
and
the
old
watchmaker
of
the
every
now
and
then
the
chemist
joined
them
with
his
flute
they
began
at
five
and
went
on
till
nine
between
each
piece
they
drank
beer
neighbors
used
to
come
in
and
out
and
listen
without
a
word
leaning
against
the
wall
and
nodding
their
heads
and
beating
time
with
their
feet
and
filling
the
room
with
clouds
of
page
followed
page
piece
followed
piece
but
the
patience
of
the
musicians
was
never
exhausted
they
did
not
speak
they
were
all
attention
their
brows
were
knit
and
from
time
to
time
they
grunted
with
pleasure
but
for
the
rest
they
were
perfectly
incapable
not
only
of
expressing
but
even
of
feeling
the
beauty
of
what
they
played
they
played
neither
very
accurately
nor
in
good
time
but
they
never
went
off
the
rails
and
followed
faithfully
the
marked
changes
of
tone
they
had
that
musical
facility
which
is
easily
satisfied
that
mediocre
perfection
which
is
so
plentiful
in
the
race
which
is
said
to
be
the
most
musical
in
the
world
they
had
also
that
great
appetite
which
does
not
stickle
for
the
quality
of
its
food
so
only
there
be
quantity
that
healthy
appetite
to
which
all
music
is
good
and
the
more
substantial
the
better
it
sees
no
difference
between
brahms
and
beethoven
or
between
the
works
of
the
same
master
between
an
empty
concerto
and
a
moving
sonata
because
they
are
fashioned
of
the
same
stuff
sat
apart
in
a
corner
which
was
his
own
behind
the
piano
no
one
could
disturb
him
there
for
to
reach
it
he
had
to
go
on
all
fours
it
was
half
dark
there
and
the
boy
had
just
room
to
lie
on
the
floor
if
he
huddled
up
the
smoke
of
the
tobacco
filled
his
eyes
and
throat
dust
too
there
were
large
flakes
of
it
like
sheepskin
but
he
did
not
mind
that
and
listened
gravely
squatting
there
turkish
fashion
and
widening
the
holes
in
the
cloth
of
the
piano
with
his
dirty
little
fingers
he
did
not
like
everything
that
they
played
but
nothing
that
they
played
bored
him
and
he
never
tried
to
formulate
his
opinions
for
he
thought
himself
too
small
to
know
anything
only
some
music
sent
him
to
sleep
some
woke
him
up
it
was
never
disagreeable
to
him
without
his
knowing
it
it
was
nearly
always
good
music
that
excited
him
sure
of
not
being
seen
he
made
faces
he
wrinkled
his
nose
ground
his
teeth
or
stuck
out
his
tongue
his
eyes
flashed
with
anger
or
drooped
languidly
he
moved
his
arms
and
legs
with
a
defiant
and
valiant
air
he
wanted
to
march
to
lunge
out
to
pulverize
the
world
he
fidgeted
so
much
that
in
the
end
a
head
would
peer
over
the
piano
and
say
hullo
boy
are
you
mad
leave
the
piano
take
your
hand
away
or
i
pull
your
ears
and
that
made
him
crestfallen
and
angry
why
did
they
want
to
spoil
his
pleasure
he
was
not
doing
any
harm
must
he
always
be
tormented
his
father
chimed
in
they
chid
him
for
making
a
noise
and
said
that
he
did
not
like
music
and
in
the
end
he
believed
it
these
honest
citizens
grinding
out
concertos
would
have
been
astonished
if
they
had
been
told
that
the
only
person
in
the
company
who
really
felt
the
music
was
the
little
boy
if
they
wanted
him
to
keep
quiet
why
did
they
play
airs
which
make
you
march
in
those
pages
were
rearing
horses
swords
the
pride
of
triumph
and
they
wanted
him
like
them
to
do
no
more
than
wag
his
head
and
beat
time
with
his
feet
they
had
only
to
play
placid
dreams
or
some
of
those
chattering
pages
which
talk
so
much
and
say
nothing
there
are
plenty
of
them
for
example
like
that
piece
of
goldmark
of
which
the
old
watchmaker
had
just
said
with
a
delighted
smile
it
is
pretty
there
is
no
harshness
in
it
all
the
corners
are
rounded
off
the
boy
was
very
quiet
then
he
became
drowsy
he
did
not
know
what
they
were
playing
hardly
heard
it
but
he
was
happy
his
limbs
were
numbed
and
he
was
dreaming
his
dreams
were
not
a
consecutive
story
they
had
neither
head
nor
tail
it
was
rarely
that
he
saw
a
definite
picture
his
mother
making
a
cake
and
with
a
knife
removing
the
paste
that
clung
to
her
fingers
a
that
he
had
seen
the
night
before
swimming
in
the
river
a
whip
that
he
wanted
to
make
with
a
willow
wand
heaven
knows
why
these
things
should
have
cropped
up
in
his
memory
at
such
a
time
but
most
often
he
saw
nothing
at
all
and
yet
he
felt
things
innumerable
and
infinite
it
was
as
though
there
were
a
number
of
very
important
things
not
to
be
spoken
of
or
not
worth
speaking
of
because
they
were
so
well
known
and
because
they
had
always
been
so
some
of
them
were
sad
terribly
sad
but
there
was
nothing
painful
in
them
as
there
is
in
the
things
that
belong
to
real
life
they
were
not
ugly
and
debasing
like
the
blows
that
had
from
his
father
or
like
the
things
that
were
in
his
head
when
sick
at
heart
with
shame
he
thought
of
some
humiliation
they
filled
the
mind
with
a
melancholy
calm
and
some
were
bright
and
shining
shedding
torrents
of
joy
and
thought
yes
it
is
thus
that
i
will
do
he
did
not
know
exactly
what
was
nor
why
he
said
it
but
he
felt
that
he
had
to
say
it
and
that
it
was
clear
as
day
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
sea
and
he
was
quite
near
to
it
kept
from
it
only
by
a
wall
of
dunes
had
no
idea
what
sea
it
was
or
what
it
wanted
with
him
but
he
was
conscious
that
it
would
rise
above
the
barrier
of
dunes
and
then
then
all
would
be
well
and
he
would
be
quite
happy
nothing
to
do
but
to
hear
it
then
quite
near
to
sink
to
sleep
to
the
sound
of
its
great
voice
soothing
away
all
his
little
griefs
and
humiliations
they
were
sad
still
but
no
longer
shameful
nor
injurious
everything
seemed
natural
and
almost
sweet
very
often
it
was
mediocre
music
that
produced
this
intoxication
in
him
the
writers
of
it
were
poor
devils
with
no
thought
in
their
heads
but
the
gaining
of
money
or
the
hiding
away
of
the
emptiness
of
their
lives
by
tagging
notes
together
according
to
accepted
formulæ
or
to
be
original
in
defiance
of
formulæ
but
in
the
notes
of
music
even
when
handled
by
an
idiot
there
is
such
a
power
of
life
that
they
can
let
loose
storms
in
a
simple
soul
perhaps
even
the
dreams
suggested
by
the
idiots
are
more
mysterious
and
more
free
than
those
breathed
by
an
imperious
thought
which
drags
you
along
by
force
for
aimless
movement
and
empty
chatter
do
not
disturb
the
mind
in
its
own
pondering
so
forgotten
and
forgetting
the
child
stayed
in
his
corner
behind
the
piano
until
suddenly
he
felt
ants
climbing
up
his
legs
and
he
remembered
then
that
he
was
a
little
boy
wife
dirty
nails
and
that
he
was
rubbing
his
nose
against
a
wall
and
holding
his
feet
in
his
hands
on
the
day
when
melchior
stealing
on
tiptoe
had
surprised
the
boy
at
the
keyboard
that
was
too
high
for
him
he
had
stayed
to
watch
him
for
a
moment
and
suddenly
there
had
flashed
upon
him
a
little
prodigy
why
had
he
not
thought
of
it
what
luck
for
the
family
no
doubt
he
had
thought
that
the
boy
would
be
a
little
peasant
like
his
mother
it
would
cost
nothing
to
try
what
a
great
thing
it
would
be
he
would
take
him
all
over
germany
perhaps
abroad
it
would
be
a
jolly
life
and
noble
to
boot
melchior
never
failed
to
look
for
the
nobility
hidden
in
all
he
did
for
it
was
not
often
that
he
failed
to
find
it
after
some
reflection
strong
in
this
assurance
immediately
after
supper
as
soon
as
he
had
taken
his
last
mouthful
he
dumped
the
child
once
more
in
front
of
the
piano
and
made
him
go
through
the
day
lesson
until
his
eyes
closed
in
weariness
then
three
times
the
next
day
then
the
day
after
that
then
every
day
soon
tired
of
it
then
he
was
sick
to
death
of
it
finally
he
could
stand
it
no
more
and
tried
to
revolt
against
it
there
was
no
point
in
what
he
was
made
to
do
nothing
but
learning
to
run
as
fast
as
possible
over
the
keys
by
loosening
the
thumb
or
exercising
the
fourth
finger
which
would
cling
awkwardly
to
the
two
next
to
it
it
got
on
his
nerves
there
was
nothing
beautiful
in
it
there
was
an
end
of
the
magic
sounds
and
fascinating
monsters
and
the
universe
of
dreams
felt
in
one
moment
nothing
but
scales
and
exercises
dry
monotonous
dull
duller
than
the
conversation
at
which
was
always
the
same
always
about
the
dishes
and
always
the
same
dishes
at
first
the
child
listened
absently
to
what
his
father
said
when
he
was
severely
reprimanded
he
went
on
with
a
bad
grace
he
paid
no
attention
to
abuse
he
met
it
with
bad
temper
the
last
straw
was
when
one
evening
he
heard
melchior
unfold
his
plans
in
the
next
room
so
it
was
in
order
to
put
him
on
show
like
a
trick
animal
that
he
was
so
badgered
and
forced
every
day
to
move
bits
of
ivory
he
was
not
even
given
time
to
go
and
see
his
beloved
river
what
was
it
made
them
so
set
against
him
he
was
angry
hurt
in
his
pride
robbed
of
his
liberty
he
decided
that
he
would
play
no
more
or
as
badly
as
possible
and
would
discourage
his
father
it
would
be
hard
but
at
all
costs
he
must
keep
his
independence
the
very
next
lesson
he
began
to
put
his
plan
into
execution
he
set
himself
conscientiously
to
hit
the
notes
awry
or
to
bungle
every
touch
melchior
cried
out
then
roared
and
blows
began
to
rain
he
had
a
heavy
ruler
at
every
false
note
he
struck
the
boy
fingers
and
at
the
same
time
shouted
in
his
ears
so
that
he
was
like
to
deafen
him
face
twitched
tinder
the
pain
of
it
he
bit
his
lips
to
keep
himself
from
crying
and
stoically
went
on
hitting
the
notes
all
wrong
bobbing
his
head
down
whenever
he
felt
a
blow
coming
but
his
system
was
not
good
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
began
to
see
that
it
was
so
melchior
was
as
obstinate
as
his
son
and
he
swore
that
even
if
they
were
to
stay
there
two
days
and
two
nights
he
would
not
let
him
off
a
single
note
until
it
had
been
properly
played
then
tried
too
deliberately
to
play
wrongly
and
melchior
began
to
suspect
the
trick
as
he
saw
that
the
boy
hand
fell
heavily
to
one
side
at
every
note
with
obvious
intent
the
blows
became
more
frequent
was
no
longer
conscious
of
his
fingers
he
wept
pitifully
and
silently
sniffing
and
swallowing
down
his
sobs
and
tears
he
understood
that
he
had
nothing
to
gain
by
going
on
like
that
and
that
he
would
have
to
resort
to
desperate
measures
he
stopped
and
trembling
at
the
thought
of
the
storm
which
was
about
to
let
loose
he
said
valiantly
papa
i
wo
play
any
more
melchior
choked
what
what
he
cried
he
took
and
almost
broke
the
boy
arm
with
shaking
it
trembling
more
and
more
and
raising
his
elbow
to
ward
off
the
blows
said
again
i
wo
play
any
more
first
because
i
do
like
being
beaten
and
then
he
could
not
finish
a
terrific
blow
knocked
the
wind
out
of
him
and
melchior
roared
ah
you
do
like
being
beaten
you
do
like
it
blows
rained
bawled
through
his
sobs
and
then
i
do
like
music
i
do
like
music
he
slipped
down
from
his
chair
melchior
roughly
put
him
back
and
knocked
his
knuckles
against
the
keyboard
he
cried
you
shall
play
and
shouted
no
no
i
wo
play
melchior
had
to
surrender
he
thrashed
the
boy
thrust
him
from
the
room
and
said
that
he
should
have
nothing
to
eat
all
day
or
the
whole
month
until
he
had
played
all
his
exercises
without
a
mistake
he
kicked
him
out
and
slammed
the
door
after
him
found
himself
on
the
stairs
the
dark
and
dirty
stairs
a
draught
came
through
a
broken
pane
in
the
skylight
and
the
walls
were
dripping
sat
on
one
of
the
greasy
steps
his
heart
was
beating
wildly
with
anger
and
emotion
in
a
low
voice
he
cursed
his
father
beast
that
what
you
are
a
beast
a
gross
creature
a
brute
yes
a
brute
and
i
hate
you
i
hate
you
oh
i
wish
you
were
dead
i
wish
you
were
dead
his
bosom
swelled
he
looked
desperately
at
the
sticky
staircase
and
the
spider
web
swinging
in
the
wind
above
the
broken
pane
he
felt
alone
lost
in
his
misery
he
looked
at
the
gap
in
the
banisters
what
if
he
were
to
throw
himself
down
or
out
of
the
window
yes
what
if
he
were
to
kill
himself
to
punish
them
how
remorseful
they
would
be
he
heard
the
noise
of
his
fall
from
the
stairs
the
door
upstairs
opened
suddenly
agonized
voices
cried
he
has
fallen
he
has
fallen
footsteps
clattered
downstairs
his
father
and
mother
threw
themselves
weeping
upon
his
body
his
mother
sobbed
it
is
your
fault
you
have
killed
him
his
father
waved
his
arms
threw
himself
on
his
knees
beat
his
head
against
the
banisters
and
cried
what
a
wretch
am
i
what
a
wretch
am
i
the
sight
of
all
this
softened
his
misery
he
was
on
the
point
of
taking
pity
on
their
grief
but
then
he
thought
that
it
was
well
for
them
had
he
enjoyed
his
revenge
when
his
story
was
ended
he
found
himself
once
more
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
in
the
dark
he
looked
down
once
more
and
his
desire
to
throw
himself
down
was
gone
he
even
shuddered
a
little
and
moved
away
from
the
edge
thinking
that
he
might
fall
then
he
felt
that
he
was
a
prisoner
like
a
poor
bird
in
a
cage
a
prisoner
forever
with
nothing
to
do
but
to
break
his
head
and
hurt
himself
he
wept
wept
and
he
robbed
his
eyes
with
his
dirty
little
hands
so
that
in
a
moment
he
was
filthy
as
he
wept
he
never
left
off
looking
at
the
things
about
him
and
he
found
some
distraction
in
that
he
stopped
moaning
for
a
moment
to
look
at
the
spider
which
had
just
begun
to
move
then
he
began
with
less
conviction
he
listened
to
the
sound
of
his
own
weeping
and
went
on
mechanically
with
his
sobbing
without
much
knowing
why
he
did
so
soon
he
got
up
he
was
attracted
by
the
window
he
sat
on
the
retiring
into
the
background
and
watched
the
spider
furtively
it
interested
while
it
revolted
him
below
the
rhine
flowed
washing
the
walls
of
the
house
in
the
staircase
window
it
was
like
being
suspended
over
the
river
in
a
moving
sky
never
limped
down
the
stairs
without
taking
a
long
look
at
it
but
he
had
never
yet
seen
it
as
it
was
grief
sharpens
the
senses
it
is
as
though
everything
were
more
sharply
graven
on
the
vision
after
tears
have
washed
away
the
dim
traces
of
memory
the
river
was
like
a
living
thing
to
the
child
a
creature
inexplicable
but
how
much
more
powerful
than
all
the
creatures
that
he
knew
leaned
forward
to
see
it
better
he
pressed
his
mouth
and
flattened
his
nose
against
the
pane
where
was
going
what
did
want
looked
free
and
sure
of
its
road
nothing
could
stop
at
all
hours
of
the
day
or
night
rain
or
sun
whether
there
were
joy
or
sorrow
in
the
house
went
on
going
by
and
it
was
as
though
nothing
mattered
to
as
though
never
knew
sorrow
and
rejoiced
in
its
strength
what
joy
to
be
like
to
run
through
the
fields
and
by
and
over
little
shining
pebbles
and
crisping
sand
and
to
care
for
nothing
to
be
cramped
by
nothing
to
be
free
the
boy
looked
and
listened
greedily
it
was
as
though
he
were
borne
along
by
the
river
moving
by
with
it
when
he
closed
his
eyes
he
saw
color
blue
green
yellow
red
and
great
chasing
shadows
and
sunbeams
what
he
sees
takes
shape
now
it
is
a
large
plain
reeds
corn
waving
under
a
breeze
scented
with
new
grass
and
mint
flowers
on
every
side
cornflowers
poppies
violets
how
lovely
it
is
how
sweet
the
air
how
good
it
is
to
lie
down
in
the
thick
soft
grass
feels
glad
and
a
little
bewildered
as
he
does
when
on
his
father
pours
into
his
glass
a
little
rhine
wine
the
river
goes
by
the
country
is
changed
now
there
are
trees
leaning
over
the
water
their
delicate
leaves
like
little
hands
dip
move
and
turn
about
in
the
water
a
village
among
the
trees
is
mirrored
in
the
river
there
are
and
the
crosses
of
the
cemetery
showing
above
the
white
wall
washed
by
the
stream
then
there
are
rocks
a
mountain
gorge
vines
on
the
slopes
a
little
and
ruined
castles
and
once
more
the
plain
corn
birds
and
the
sun
the
great
green
mass
of
the
river
goes
by
smoothly
like
a
single
thought
there
are
no
waves
almost
no
ripples
smooth
oily
patches
does
not
see
it
he
has
closed
his
eyes
to
hear
it
better
the
ceaseless
roaring
fills
him
makes
him
giddy
he
is
exalted
by
this
eternal
masterful
dream
which
goes
no
man
knows
whither
over
the
turmoil
of
its
depths
rush
waters
in
swift
rhythm
eagerly
ardently
and
from
the
rhythm
ascends
music
like
a
vine
climbing
a
trellis
arpeggios
from
silver
keys
sorrowful
violins
velvety
and
flutes
the
country
has
disappeared
the
river
has
disappeared
there
floats
by
only
a
strange
soft
and
twilight
atmosphere
heart
flutters
with
emotion
what
does
he
see
now
oh
charming
faces
a
little
girl
with
brown
tresses
calls
to
him
slowly
softly
and
mockingly
a
pale
boy
face
looks
at
him
with
melancholy
blue
eyes
others
smile
other
eyes
look
at
him
curious
and
provoking
eyes
and
their
glances
make
him
blush
eyes
affectionate
and
mournful
like
the
eyes
of
a
dog
eyes
imperious
eyes
suffering
and
the
pale
face
of
a
woman
with
black
hair
and
lips
close
pressed
and
eyes
so
large
that
they
obscure
her
other
features
and
they
gaze
upon
with
an
ardor
that
hurts
him
and
dearest
of
all
that
face
which
smiles
upon
him
with
clear
gray
eyes
and
lips
a
little
open
showing
gleaming
white
teeth
ah
how
kind
and
tender
is
that
smile
all
his
heart
is
tenderness
from
it
how
good
it
is
to
love
again
smile
upon
me
again
do
not
go
alas
it
is
gone
but
it
leaves
in
his
heart
sweetness
ineffable
evil
sorrow
are
no
more
nothing
is
left
nothing
only
an
airy
dream
like
serene
music
floating
down
a
sunbeam
like
the
gossamers
on
fine
summer
days
what
has
happened
what
are
these
visions
that
fill
the
child
with
sadness
and
sweet
sorrow
never
had
he
seen
them
before
and
yet
he
knew
them
and
recognized
them
whence
come
they
from
what
obscure
abysm
of
creation
are
they
what
has
been
what
will
be
now
all
is
done
every
haunting
form
is
gone
once
more
through
a
misty
veil
as
though
he
were
soaring
high
above
it
the
river
in
flood
appears
covering
the
fields
and
rolling
by
majestic
slow
almost
still
and
far
far
away
like
a
steely
light
upon
the
horizon
a
watery
plain
a
line
of
trembling
waves
the
sea
the
river
runs
down
to
it
the
sea
seems
to
run
up
to
the
river
she
fires
him
he
desires
her
he
must
lose
himself
in
her
the
music
hovers
lovely
dance
rhythms
swing
out
madly
all
the
world
is
rocked
in
their
triumphant
whirligig
the
soul
set
free
cleaves
space
like
swallows
flight
like
swallows
drunk
with
the
air
skimming
across
the
sky
with
shrill
cries
joy
joy
there
is
nothing
nothing
oh
infinite
happiness
hours
passed
it
was
evening
the
staircase
was
in
darkness
drops
of
rain
made
rings
upon
the
river
gown
and
the
current
bore
them
dancing
away
sometimes
the
branch
of
a
tree
or
pieces
of
black
bark
passed
noiselessly
and
disappeared
the
murderous
spider
had
withdrawn
to
her
darkest
corner
and
little
was
still
leaning
forward
on
the
his
face
was
pale
and
dirty
happiness
shone
in
him
he
was
asleep

he
had
to
surrender
in
spite
of
an
obstinate
and
heroic
resistance
blows
triumphed
over
his
every
morning
for
three
hours
and
for
three
hours
every
evening
was
set
before
the
instrument
of
torture
all
on
edge
with
attention
and
weariness
with
large
tears
rolling
down
his
cheeks
and
nose
he
moved
his
little
red
hands
over
the
black
and
white
keys
his
hands
were
often
stiff
with
cold
under
the
threatening
ruler
which
descended
at
every
false
note
and
the
harangues
of
his
master
which
were
more
odious
to
him
than
the
blows
he
thought
that
he
hated
music
and
yet
he
applied
himself
to
it
with
a
zest
which
fear
of
melchior
did
not
altogether
explain
certain
words
of
his
grandfather
had
made
an
impression
on
him
the
old
man
seeing
his
grandson
weeping
had
told
him
with
that
gravity
which
he
always
maintained
for
the
boy
that
it
was
worth
while
suffering
a
little
for
the
most
beautiful
and
noble
art
given
to
men
for
their
consolation
and
glory
and
who
was
grateful
to
his
grandfather
for
talking
to
him
like
a
man
had
been
secretly
touched
by
these
simple
words
which
sorted
well
with
his
childish
stoicism
and
growing
pride
but
more
than
by
argument
he
was
bound
and
enslaved
by
the
memory
of
certain
musical
emotions
bound
and
enslaved
to
the
detested
art
against
which
he
tried
in
vain
to
rebel
there
was
in
the
town
as
usual
in
germany
a
theater
where
opera
operetta
drama
comedy
and
vaudeville
are
presented
every
sort
of
play
of
every
style
and
fashion
there
were
performances
three
times
a
week
from
six
to
nine
in
the
evening
old
jean
michel
never
missed
one
and
was
equally
interested
in
everything
once
he
took
his
grandson
with
him
several
days
beforehand
he
told
him
at
length
what
the
piece
was
about
did
not
understand
it
but
he
did
gather
that
there
would
be
terrible
things
in
it
and
while
he
was
consumed
with
the
desire
to
see
them
he
was
much
afraid
though
he
dared
not
confess
it
he
knew
that
there
was
to
be
a
storm
and
he
was
fearful
of
being
struck
by
lightning
he
knew
that
there
was
to
be
a
battle
and
he
was
not
at
all
sure
that
he
would
not
be
killed
on
the
night
before
in
bed
he
went
through
real
agony
and
on
the
day
of
the
performance
he
almost
wished
that
his
grandfather
might
be
prevented
from
coming
for
him
but
when
the
hour
was
near
and
his
grandfather
did
not
come
he
began
to
worry
and
every
other
minute
looked
out
of
the
window
at
last
the
old
man
appeared
and
they
set
out
together
his
heart
leaped
in
his
bosom
his
tongue
was
dry
and
he
could
not
speak
they
arrived
at
the
mysterious
building
which
was
so
often
talked
about
at
home
at
the
door
jean
michel
met
some
acquaintances
and
the
boy
who
was
holding
his
hand
tight
because
he
was
afraid
of
being
lost
could
not
understand
how
they
could
talk
and
laugh
quietly
at
such
a
moment
jean
michel
took
his
usual
place
in
the
first
row
behind
the
orchestra
he
leaned
on
the
balustrade
and
began
a
long
conversation
with
the
he
was
at
home
there
there
he
was
listened
to
because
of
his
authority
as
a
musician
and
he
made
the
most
of
it
it
might
almost
be
said
that
he
abused
it
could
hear
nothing
he
was
overwhelmed
by
his
expectation
of
the
play
by
the
appearance
of
the
theater
which
seemed
magnificent
to
him
by
the
splendor
of
the
audience
who
frightened
him
terribly
he
dared
not
turn
his
head
for
he
thought
that
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
he
hugged
his
little
cap
between
his
knees
and
he
stared
at
the
magic
curtain
with
round
eyes
at
last
three
blows
were
struck
his
grandfather
blew
his
nose
and
drew
the
from
his
pocket
he
always
followed
it
scrupulously
so
much
so
that
sometimes
he
neglected
what
was
happening
on
the
stage
the
orchestra
began
to
play
with
the
opening
chords
felt
more
at
ease
he
was
at
home
in
this
world
of
sound
and
from
that
moment
however
extravagant
the
play
might
be
it
seemed
natural
to
him
the
curtain
was
raised
to
reveal
pasteboard
trees
and
creatures
who
were
not
much
more
real
the
boy
looked
at
it
all
gaping
with
admiration
but
he
was
not
surprised
the
piece
set
in
a
fantastic
east
of
which
he
could
have
had
no
idea
the
poem
was
a
web
of
ineptitudes
in
which
no
human
quality
was
perceptible
hardly
grasped
it
at
all
he
made
extraordinary
mistakes
took
one
character
for
another
and
pulled
at
his
grandfather
sleeve
to
ask
him
absurd
questions
which
showed
that
he
had
understood
nothing
he
was
not
bored
passionately
interested
on
the
contrary
bound
the
idiotic
he
built
a
romance
of
his
own
invention
which
had
no
sort
of
relation
to
the
one
that
was
represented
on
the
stage
every
moment
some
incident
upset
his
romance
and
he
had
to
repair
it
but
that
did
not
worry
him
he
had
made
his
choice
of
the
people
who
moved
upon
the
stage
making
all
sorts
of
different
sounds
and
breathlessly
he
followed
the
fate
of
those
upon
whom
he
had
fastened
his
sympathy
he
was
especially
concerned
with
a
fair
lady
of
uncertain
age
who
had
long
brilliantly
fair
hair
eyes
of
an
unnatural
size
and
bare
feet
the
monstrous
improbabilities
of
the
setting
did
not
shock
him
his
keen
childish
eyes
did
not
perceive
the
grotesque
ugliness
of
the
actors
large
and
fleshy
and
the
deformed
chorus
of
all
sizes
in
two
lines
nor
the
pointlessness
of
their
gestures
nor
their
faces
bloated
by
their
shrieks
nor
the
full
wigs
nor
the
high
heels
of
the
tenor
nor
the
of
his
whose
face
was
streaked
with
variegated
penciling
he
was
in
the
condition
of
a
lover
whose
passion
blinds
him
to
the
actual
aspect
of
the
beloved
object
the
marvelous
power
of
illusion
natural
to
children
stopped
all
unpleasant
sensations
on
the
way
and
transformed
them
the
music
especially
worked
wonders
it
bathed
the
whole
scene
in
a
misty
atmosphere
in
which
everything
became
beautiful
noble
and
desirable
it
bred
in
the
soul
a
desperate
need
of
love
and
at
the
same
time
showed
phantoms
of
love
on
all
sides
to
fill
the
void
that
itself
had
created
little
was
overwhelmed
by
his
emotion
there
were
words
gestures
musical
phrases
which
disturbed
him
he
dared
not
then
raise
his
eyes
he
knew
not
whether
it
were
well
or
ill
he
blushed
and
grew
pale
by
turns
sometimes
there
came
drops
of
sweat
upon
his
brow
and
he
was
fearful
lest
all
the
people
there
should
see
his
distress
when
the
catastrophe
came
about
which
inevitably
breaks
upon
lovers
in
the
fourth
act
of
an
opera
so
as
to
provide
the
tenor
and
the
with
an
opportunity
for
showing
off
their
shrillest
screams
the
child
thought
he
must
choke
his
throat
hurt
him
as
though
he
had
caught
cold
he
clutched
at
his
neck
with
his
hands
and
could
not
swallow
his
saliva
tears
welled
up
in
him
his
hands
and
feet
were
frozen
fortunately
his
grandfather
was
not
much
less
moved
he
enjoyed
the
theater
with
a
childish
simplicity
during
the
dramatic
passages
he
coughed
carelessly
to
hide
his
distress
but
saw
it
and
it
delighted
him
it
was
horribly
hot
was
dropping
with
sleep
and
he
was
very
uncomfortable
but
he
thought
only
is
there
much
longer
it
can
not
be
finished
then
suddenly
it
was
finished
without
his
knowing
why
the
curtain
fell
the
audience
rose
the
enchantment
was
broken
they
went
home
through
the
night
the
two
children
the
old
man
and
the
little
boy
what
a
fine
night
what
a
serene
moonlight
they
said
nothing
they
were
turning
over
their
memories
at
last
the
old
man
said
did
you
like
it
boy
could
not
reply
he
was
still
fearful
from
emotion
and
he
would
not
speak
so
as
not
to
break
the
spell
he
had
to
make
an
effort
to
whisper
with
a
sigh
oh
yes
the
old
man
smiled
after
a
time
he
went
on
it
a
fine
thing
a
musician
trade
to
create
things
like
that
such
marvelous
spectacles
is
there
anything
more
glorious
it
is
to
be
god
on
earth
the
boy
mind
leaped
to
that
what
a
man
had
made
all
that
that
had
not
occurred
to
him
it
had
seemed
that
it
must
have
made
itself
must
be
the
work
of
nature
a
man
a
musician
such
as
he
would
be
some
day
oh
to
be
that
for
one
day
only
one
day
and
then
afterwards
afterwards
whatever
you
like
die
if
necessary
he
asked
what
man
made
that
grandfather
the
old
man
told
him
of
françois
marie
hassler
a
young
german
artist
who
lived
at
berlin
he
had
known
him
once
listened
all
ears
suddenly
he
said
and
you
grandfather
the
old
man
trembled
what
he
asked
did
you
do
things
like
that
you
too
certainly
said
the
old
man
a
little
crossly
he
was
silent
and
after
they
had
walked
a
little
he
sighed
heavily
it
was
one
of
the
sorrows
of
his
life
he
had
always
longed
to
write
for
the
theater
and
inspiration
had
always
betrayed
him
he
had
in
his
desk
one
or
two
acts
written
but
he
had
so
little
illusion
as
to
their
worth
that
he
had
never
dared
to
submit
them
to
an
outside
judgment
they
said
no
more
until
they
reached
home
neither
slept
the
old
man
was
troubled
he
took
his
bible
for
consolation
in
bed
turned
over
and
over
the
events
of
the
evening
he
recollected
the
smallest
details
and
the
girl
with
the
bare
feet
reappeared
before
him
as
he
dozed
off
a
musical
phrase
rang
in
his
ears
as
distinctly
as
if
the
orchestra
were
there
all
his
body
leaped
he
sat
up
on
his
pillow
his
head
buzzing
with
music
and
he
thought
some
day
i
also
shall
write
oh
can
i
ever
do
it
from
that
moment
he
had
only
one
desire
to
go
to
the
theater
again
and
he
set
himself
to
work
more
keenly
because
they
made
a
visit
to
the
theater
his
reward
he
thought
of
nothing
but
that
half
the
week
he
thought
of
the
last
performance
and
the
other
half
he
thought
of
the
next
he
was
fearful
of
being
ill
on
a
theater
day
and
this
fear
made
him
often
find
in
himself
the
symptoms
of
three
or
four
illnesses
when
the
day
came
he
did
not
eat
he
fidgeted
like
a
soul
in
agony
he
looked
at
the
clock
fifty
times
and
thought
that
the
evening
would
never
come
finally
unable
to
contain
himself
he
would
go
out
an
hour
before
the
office
opened
for
fear
of
not
being
able
to
procure
a
seat
and
as
he
was
the
first
in
the
empty
theater
he
used
to
grow
uneasy
his
grandfather
had
told
him
that
once
or
twice
the
audience
had
not
been
large
enough
and
so
the
players
had
preferred
not
to
perform
and
to
give
back
the
money
he
watched
the
arrivals
and
counted
them
thinking
oh
it
is
not
enough
there
will
never
be
enough
when
he
saw
some
important
person
enter
the
circle
or
the
stalls
his
heart
was
lighter
and
he
said
to
himself
they
will
never
dare
to
send
him
away
surely
they
will
play
for
him
but
he
was
not
convinced
he
would
not
be
reassured
until
the
musicians
took
their
places
and
even
then
he
would
be
afraid
that
the
curtain
would
rise
and
they
would
announce
as
they
had
done
one
evening
a
change
of
programme
with
lynx
eyes
he
watched
the
stand
of
the
to
see
if
the
title
written
on
his
music
was
that
of
the
piece
announced
and
when
he
had
seen
it
there
two
minutes
later
he
would
look
again
to
make
quite
sure
that
he
had
not
been
wrong
the
conductor
was
not
there
he
must
be
ill
there
was
a
stirring
behind
the
curtain
and
a
sound
of
voices
and
hurried
footsteps
was
there
an
accident
some
untoward
misfortune
silence
again
the
conductor
was
at
his
post
everything
seemed
ready
at
last
they
did
not
begin
what
was
happening
he
boiled
over
with
impatience
then
the
bell
rang
his
heart
thumped
away
the
orchestra
began
the
overture
and
for
a
few
hours
would
swim
in
happiness
troubled
only
by
the
idea
that
it
must
soon
come
to
an
end
some
time
after
that
a
musical
event
brought
even
more
excitement
into
thoughts
françois
marie
hassler
the
author
of
the
first
opera
which
had
so
bowled
him
over
was
to
visit
the
town
he
was
to
conduct
a
concert
consisting
of
his
compositions
the
town
was
excited
the
young
musician
was
the
subject
of
violent
discussion
in
germany
and
for
a
fortnight
he
was
the
only
topic
of
conversation
it
was
a
different
matter
when
he
arrived
the
friends
of
melchior
and
old
jean
michel
continually
came
for
news
and
they
went
away
with
the
most
extravagant
notions
of
the
musician
habits
and
eccentricities
the
child
followed
these
narratives
with
eager
attention
the
idea
that
the
great
man
was
there
in
the
town
breathing
the
same
air
as
himself
treading
the
same
stones
threw
him
into
a
state
of
dumb
exaltation
he
lived
only
in
the
hope
of
seeing
him
hassler
was
staying
at
the
palace
as
the
guest
of
the
grand
duke
he
hardly
went
out
except
to
the
theater
for
rehearsals
to
which
was
not
admitted
and
as
he
was
very
lazy
he
went
to
and
fro
in
the
prince
carriage
therefore
did
not
have
many
opportunities
of
seeing
him
and
he
only
succeeded
once
in
catching
sight
of
him
as
he
drove
in
the
carriage
he
saw
his
fur
coat
and
wasted
hours
in
waiting
in
the
street
thrusting
and
jostling
his
way
to
right
and
left
and
before
and
behind
to
win
and
keep
his
place
in
front
of
the
loungers
he
consoled
himself
with
spending
half
his
days
watching
the
windows
of
the
palace
which
had
been
pointed
out
as
those
of
the
master
most
often
he
only
saw
the
shutters
for
hassler
got
up
late
and
the
windows
were
closed
almost
all
morning
this
habit
had
made
persons
say
that
hassler
could
not
bear
the
light
of
day
and
lived
in
eternal
night
at
length
was
able
to
approach
his
hero
it
was
the
day
of
the
concert
all
the
town
was
there
the
grand
duke
and
his
court
occupied
the
great
royal
box
surmounted
with
a
crown
supported
by
two
chubby
cherubim
the
theater
was
in
gala
array
the
stage
was
decorated
with
branches
of
oak
and
flowering
laurel
all
the
musicians
of
any
account
made
it
a
point
of
honor
to
take
their
places
in
the
orchestra
melchior
was
at
his
post
and
jean
michel
was
conducting
the
chorus
when
hassler
appeared
there
was
loud
applause
from
every
part
of
the
house
and
the
ladies
rose
to
see
him
better
devoured
him
with
his
eyes
hassler
had
a
young
sensitive
face
though
it
was
already
rather
puffy
and
his
temples
were
bald
and
his
hair
was
thin
on
the
crown
of
his
head
for
the
rest
fair
curly
hair
his
blue
eyes
looked
vague
he
had
a
little
fair
mustache
and
an
expressive
mouth
which
was
rarely
still
but
twitched
with
a
thousand
imperceptible
movements
he
was
tall
and
held
himself
badly
not
from
awkwardness
but
from
weariness
or
boredom
he
conducted
capriciously
and
lithely
with
his
whole
awkward
body
swaying
like
his
music
with
gestures
now
caressing
now
sharp
and
jerky
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
was
very
nervous
and
his
music
was
the
exact
reflection
of
himself
the
quivering
and
jerky
life
of
it
broke
through
the
usual
apathy
of
the
orchestra
breathed
heavily
in
spite
of
his
fear
of
drawing
attention
to
himself
he
could
not
stand
still
in
his
place
he
fidgeted
got
up
and
the
music
gave
him
such
violent
and
unexpected
shocks
that
he
had
to
move
his
head
arms
and
legs
to
the
great
discomfort
of
his
neighbors
who
warded
off
his
kicks
as
best
they
could
the
whole
audience
was
enthusiastic
fascinated
by
the
success
rather
than
by
the
compositions
at
the
end
there
was
a
storm
of
applause
and
cries
in
which
the
trumpets
in
the
orchestra
joined
german
fashion
with
their
triumphant
blare
in
salute
of
the
conqueror
trembled
with
pride
as
though
these
honors
were
for
himself
he
enjoyed
seeing
hassler
face
light
up
with
childish
pleasure
the
ladies
threw
flowers
the
men
waved
their
hats
and
the
audience
rushed
for
the
platform
every
one
wanted
to
shake
the
master
hand
saw
one
enthusiast
raise
the
master
hand
to
his
lips
another
steal
a
handkerchief
that
hassler
had
left
on
the
corner
of
his
desk
he
wanted
to
reach
the
platform
also
although
he
did
not
know
why
for
if
at
that
moment
he
had
found
himself
near
hassler
he
would
have
fled
at
once
in
terror
and
emotion
but
he
butted
with
all
his
force
like
a
ram
among
the
skirts
and
legs
that
divided
him
from
hassler
he
was
too
small
he
could
not
break
through
fortunately
when
the
concert
was
over
his
grandfather
came
and
took
him
to
join
in
a
party
to
serenade
hassler
it
was
night
and
torches
were
lighted
all
the
musicians
of
the
orchestra
were
there
they
talked
only
of
the
marvelous
compositions
they
had
heard
they
arrived
outside
the
palace
and
took
up
their
places
without
a
sound
under
the
master
windows
they
took
on
an
air
of
secrecy
although
everybody
including
hassler
knew
what
was
to
come
in
the
silence
of
the
night
they
began
to
play
certain
famous
fragments
of
hassler
compositions
he
appeared
at
the
window
with
the
prince
and
they
roared
in
their
honor
both
bowed
a
servant
came
from
the
prince
to
invite
the
musicians
to
enter
the
palace
they
passed
through
great
rooms
with
frescoes
representing
naked
men
with
helmets
they
were
of
a
reddish
color
and
were
making
gestures
of
defiance
the
sky
was
covered
with
great
clouds
like
sponges
there
were
also
men
and
women
of
marble
clad
in
made
of
iron
the
guests
walked
on
carpets
so
thick
that
their
tread
was
inaudible
and
they
came
at
length
to
a
room
which
was
as
light
as
day
and
there
were
tables
laden
with
drinks
and
good
things
the
grand
duke
was
there
but
did
not
see
him
he
had
eyes
only
for
hassler
hassler
came
towards
them
he
thanked
them
he
picked
his
words
carefully
stopped
awkwardly
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
and
extricated
himself
with
a
quip
which
made
everybody
laugh
they
began
to
eat
hassler
took
four
or
five
musicians
aside
he
singled
out
grandfather
and
addressed
very
flattering
words
to
him
he
recollected
that
jean
michel
had
been
one
of
the
first
to
perform
his
works
and
he
said
that
he
had
often
heard
tell
of
his
excellence
from
a
friend
of
his
who
had
been
a
pupil
of
the
old
man
grandfather
expressed
his
gratitude
profusely
he
replied
with
such
extraordinary
eulogy
that
in
spite
of
his
adoration
of
hassler
the
boy
was
ashamed
but
to
hassler
they
seemed
to
be
pleasant
and
in
the
rational
order
finally
the
old
man
who
had
lost
himself
in
his
rigmarole
took
by
the
hand
and
presented
him
to
hassler
hassler
smiled
at
and
carelessly
patted
his
head
and
when
he
learned
that
the
boy
liked
his
music
and
had
not
slept
for
several
nights
in
anticipation
of
seeing
him
he
took
him
in
his
arms
and
plied
him
with
questions
struck
dumb
and
blushing
with
pleasure
dared
not
look
at
him
hassler
took
him
by
the
chin
and
lifted
his
face
up
ventured
to
look
hassler
eyes
were
kind
and
smiling
he
began
to
smile
too
then
he
felt
so
happy
so
wonderfully
happy
in
the
great
man
arms
that
he
burst
into
tears
hassler
was
touched
by
this
simple
affection
and
was
more
kind
than
ever
he
kissed
the
boy
and
talked
to
him
tenderly
at
the
same
time
he
said
funny
things
and
tickled
him
to
make
him
laugh
and
could
not
help
laughing
through
his
tears
soon
he
became
at
ease
and
answered
hassler
readily
and
of
his
own
accord
he
began
to
whisper
in
his
ear
all
his
small
ambitions
as
though
he
and
hassler
were
old
friends
he
told
him
how
he
wanted
to
be
a
musician
like
hassler
and
like
hassler
to
make
beautiful
things
and
to
be
a
great
man
he
was
always
ashamed
talked
confidently
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
saying
he
was
in
a
sort
of
ecstasy
hassler
smiled
at
his
prattling
and
said
when
you
are
a
man
and
have
become
a
good
musician
you
shall
come
and
see
me
in
berlin
i
shall
make
something
of
you
was
too
delighted
to
reply
hassler
teased
him
you
do
want
to
nodded
his
head
violently
five
or
six
times
meaning
yes
it
is
a
bargain
then
nodded
again
kiss
me
then
threw
his
arms
round
hassler
neck
and
hugged
him
with
all
his
strength
oh
you
are
wetting
me
let
go
your
nose
wants
wiping
hassler
laughed
and
wiped
the
boy
nose
himself
a
little
though
he
was
quite
jolly
he
put
him
down
then
took
him
by
the
hand
and
led
him
to
a
table
where
he
filled
his
pockets
with
cake
and
left
him
saying
remember
your
promise
swam
in
happiness
the
rest
of
the
world
had
ceased
to
exist
for
him
he
could
remember
nothing
of
what
had
happened
earlier
in
the
evening
he
followed
lovingly
hassler
every
expression
and
gesture
one
thing
that
he
said
struck
him
hassler
was
holding
a
glass
in
his
hand
he
was
talking
and
his
face
suddenly
hardened
and
he
said
the
joy
of
such
a
day
must
not
make
us
forget
our
enemies
we
must
never
forget
our
enemies
it
is
not
their
fault
that
we
are
not
crushed
out
of
existence
it
will
not
be
our
fault
if
that
does
not
happen
to
them
that
is
why
the
toast
i
propose
is
that
there
are
people
whose
health
we
will
not
drink
everybody
applauded
and
laughed
at
this
original
toast
hassler
had
laughed
with
the
others
and
his
expression
had
returned
but
was
put
off
by
it
although
he
did
not
permit
himself
to
criticise
any
action
of
his
hero
it
hurt
him
that
he
had
thought
ugly
things
when
on
such
a
night
there
ought
to
be
nothing
but
brilliant
thoughts
and
fancies
but
he
did
not
examine
what
he
felt
and
the
impression
that
it
made
was
soon
driven
out
by
his
great
joy
and
the
drop
of
champagne
which
he
drank
out
of
his
grandfather
glass
on
the
way
back
the
old
man
never
stopped
talking
he
was
delighted
with
the
praise
that
hassler
had
given
him
he
cried
out
that
hassler
was
a
genius
such
as
had
not
been
known
for
a
century
said
nothing
locking
up
in
his
heart
his
intoxication
of
love
had
kissed
him
had
held
him
in
his
arms
how
good
was
how
great
ah
he
thought
in
bed
as
he
kissed
his
pillow
passionately
i
would
die
for
him
die
for
him
the
brilliant
meteor
which
had
flashed
across
the
sky
of
the
little
town
that
night
had
a
decisive
influence
on
mind
all
his
childhood
hassler
was
the
model
on
which
his
eyes
were
fixed
and
to
follow
his
example
the
little
man
of
six
decided
that
he
also
would
write
music
to
tell
the
truth
he
had
been
doing
so
for
long
enough
without
knowing
it
and
he
had
not
waited
to
be
conscious
of
composing
before
he
composed
everything
is
music
for
the
born
musician
everything
that
throbs
or
moves
or
stirs
or
palpitates
sunlit
summer
days
nights
when
the
wind
howls
flickering
light
the
twinkling
of
the
stars
storms
the
song
of
birds
the
buzzing
of
insects
the
murmuring
of
trees
voices
loved
or
loathed
familiar
fireside
sounds
a
creaking
door
blood
moving
in
the
veins
in
the
silence
of
the
night
everything
that
is
is
music
all
that
is
needed
is
that
it
should
be
heard
all
the
music
of
creation
found
its
echo
in
everything
that
he
saw
everything
that
he
felt
was
translated
into
music
without
his
being
conscious
of
it
he
was
like
a
buzzing
hive
of
bees
but
no
one
noticed
it
himself
least
of
all
like
all
children
he
hummed
perpetually
at
every
hour
of
the
day
whatever
he
was
doing
whether
he
were
walking
in
the
street
hopping
on
one
foot
or
lying
on
the
floor
at
his
grandfather
with
his
head
in
his
hands
absorbed
in
the
pictures
of
a
book
or
sitting
in
his
little
chair
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
kitchen
dreaming
aimlessly
in
the
twilight
always
the
monotonous
murmuring
of
his
little
trumpet
was
to
be
heard
played
with
lips
closed
and
cheeks
blown
out
his
mother
seldom
paid
any
heed
to
it
but
once
in
a
while
she
would
protest
when
he
was
tired
of
this
state
of
he
would
have
to
move
and
make
a
noise
then
he
made
music
singing
it
at
the
top
of
his
voice
he
had
made
tunes
for
every
occasion
he
had
a
tune
for
splashing
in
his
in
the
morning
like
a
little
duck
he
had
a
tune
for
sitting
on
the
in
front
of
the
detested
instrument
and
another
for
getting
off
it
and
this
was
a
more
brilliant
affair
than
the
other
he
had
one
for
his
mother
putting
the
soup
on
the
table
he
used
to
go
before
her
then
blowing
a
blare
of
trumpets
he
played
triumphal
marches
by
which
to
go
solemnly
from
the
to
the
bedroom
sometimes
he
would
organize
little
processions
with
his
two
small
brothers
all
then
would
file
out
gravely
one
after
another
and
each
had
a
tune
to
march
to
but
as
was
right
and
proper
kept
the
best
for
himself
every
one
of
his
tunes
was
strictly
appropriated
to
its
special
occasion
and
never
by
any
chance
confused
them
anybody
else
would
have
made
mistakes
but
he
knew
the
shades
of
difference
between
them
exactly
one
day
at
his
grandfather
house
he
was
going
round
the
room
clicking
his
heels
head
up
and
chest
out
he
went
round
and
round
and
round
so
that
it
was
a
wonder
he
did
not
turn
sick
and
played
one
of
his
compositions
the
old
man
who
was
shaving
stopped
in
the
middle
of
it
and
with
his
face
covered
with
lather
came
to
look
at
him
and
said
what
are
you
singing
boy
said
he
did
not
know
sing
it
again
said
jean
michel
tried
he
could
not
remember
the
tune
proud
of
having
attracted
his
grandfather
attention
he
tried
to
make
him
admire
his
voice
and
sang
after
his
own
fashion
an
air
from
some
opera
but
that
was
not
what
the
old
man
wanted
jean
michel
said
nothing
and
seemed
not
to
notice
him
any
more
but
he
left
the
door
of
his
room
ajar
while
the
boy
was
playing
alone
in
the
next
room
a
few
days
later
with
the
chairs
arranged
about
him
was
playing
a
comedy
in
music
which
he
had
made
up
of
scraps
that
he
remembered
from
the
theater
and
he
was
making
steps
and
bows
as
he
had
seen
them
done
in
a
minuet
and
addressing
himself
to
the
portrait
of
beethoven
which
hung
above
the
table
as
he
turned
with
a
pirouette
he
saw
his
grandfather
watching
him
through
the
door
he
thought
the
old
man
was
laughing
at
him
he
was
abashed
and
stopped
dead
he
ran
to
the
window
and
pressed
his
face
against
the
panes
pretending
that
he
had
been
watching
something
of
the
greatest
interest
but
the
old
man
said
nothing
he
came
to
him
and
kissed
him
and
saw
that
he
was
pleased
his
vanity
made
the
most
of
these
signs
he
was
clever
enough
to
see
that
he
had
been
appreciated
but
he
did
not
know
exactly
which
his
grandfather
had
admired
most
his
talent
as
a
dramatic
author
or
as
a
musician
or
as
a
singer
or
as
a
dancer
he
inclined
to
the
latter
for
he
prided
himself
on
this
a
week
later
when
he
had
forgotten
the
whole
affair
his
grandfather
said
mysteriously
that
he
had
something
to
show
him
he
opened
his
desk
took
out
a
and
put
it
on
the
rack
of
the
piano
and
told
the
boy
to
play
was
very
much
interested
and
deciphered
it
fairly
well
the
notes
were
written
by
hand
in
the
old
man
large
handwriting
and
he
had
taken
especial
pains
with
it
the
headings
were
adorned
with
scrolls
and
flourishes
after
some
moments
the
old
man
who
was
sitting
beside
turning
the
pages
for
him
asked
him
what
the
music
was
had
been
too
much
absorbed
in
his
playing
to
notice
what
he
had
played
and
said
that
he
did
not
know
it
listen
you
do
know
it
yes
he
thought
he
knew
it
but
he
did
not
know
where
he
had
heard
it
the
old
man
laughed
think
shook
his
head
i
do
know
a
light
was
fast
dawning
in
his
mind
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
air
but
no
he
dared
not
he
would
not
recognize
it
i
do
know
grandfather
he
blushed
what
you
little
fool
do
you
see
that
it
is
your
own
he
was
sure
of
it
but
to
hear
it
said
made
his
heart
thump
oh
grandfather
beaming
the
old
man
showed
him
the
book
see
it
is
what
you
were
singing
on
tuesday
when
you
were
lying
on
the
floor
that
is
what
i
asked
you
to
sing
again
last
week
and
you
could
not
remember
it
that
is
what
you
were
dancing
by
the
armchair
look
on
the
cover
was
written
in
wonderful
gothic
letters
pleasures
of
childhood
aria
minuetto
valse
and
marcia
op
by
was
dazzled
by
it
to
see
his
name
and
that
fine
title
and
that
large
book
his
work
he
went
on
murmuring
oh
grandfather
grandfather
the
old
man
drew
him
to
him
threw
himself
on
his
knees
and
hid
his
head
in
jean
michel
bosom
he
was
covered
with
blushes
from
his
happiness
the
old
man
was
even
happier
and
went
on
in
a
voice
which
he
tried
to
make
indifferent
for
he
felt
that
he
was
on
the
point
of
breaking
down
of
course
i
added
the
accompaniment
and
the
harmony
to
fit
the
song
and
then
he
coughed
and
then
i
added
a
to
the
minuet
because
because
it
is
usual
and
then
i
think
it
is
not
at
all
bad
he
played
it
was
very
proud
of
collaborating
with
his
grandfather
but
grandfather
you
must
put
your
name
to
it
too
it
is
not
worth
while
it
is
not
worth
while
others
besides
yourself
knowing
it
only
here
his
voice
trembled
only
later
on
when
i
am
no
more
it
will
remind
you
of
your
old
grandfather
eh
you
wo
forget
him
the
poor
old
man
did
not
say
that
he
had
been
unable
to
resist
the
quite
innocent
pleasure
of
introducing
one
of
his
own
unfortunate
airs
into
his
grandson
work
which
he
felt
was
destined
to
survive
him
but
his
desire
to
share
in
this
imaginary
glory
was
very
humble
and
very
touching
since
it
was
enough
for
him
anonymously
to
transmit
to
posterity
a
scrap
of
his
own
thought
so
as
not
altogether
to
perish
was
touched
by
it
and
covered
his
face
with
kisses
and
the
old
man
growing
more
and
more
tender
kissed
his
hair
you
will
remember
me
later
on
when
you
are
a
good
musician
a
great
artist
who
will
bring
honor
to
his
family
to
his
art
and
to
his
country
when
you
are
famous
you
will
remember
that
it
was
your
old
grandfather
who
first
perceived
it
and
foretold
what
you
would
be
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
as
he
listened
to
his
own
words
he
was
reluctant
to
let
such
signs
of
weakness
be
seen
he
had
an
attack
of
coughing
became
moody
and
sent
the
boy
away
hugging
the
precious
manuscript
went
home
bewildered
by
his
happiness
the
stones
danced
about
him
the
reception
he
had
from
his
family
sobered
him
a
little
when
he
blurted
out
the
splendor
of
his
musical
exploit
they
cried
out
upon
him
his
mother
laughed
at
him
melchior
declared
that
the
old
man
was
mad
and
that
he
would
do
better
to
take
care
of
himself
than
to
set
about
turning
the
boy
head
as
for
he
would
oblige
by
putting
such
follies
from
his
mind
and
sitting
down
at
the
piano
and
playing
exercises
for
four
hours
he
must
first
learn
to
play
properly
and
as
for
composing
there
was
plenty
of
time
for
that
later
on
when
he
had
nothing
better
to
do
melchior
was
not
as
these
words
of
wisdom
might
indicate
trying
to
keep
the
boy
from
the
dangerous
exaltation
of
a
too
early
pride
on
the
contrary
he
proved
immediately
that
this
was
not
so
but
never
having
himself
had
any
idea
to
express
in
music
and
never
having
had
the
least
need
to
express
an
idea
he
had
come
as
a
to
consider
composing
a
secondary
matter
which
was
only
given
value
by
the
art
of
the
executant
he
was
not
insensible
of
the
tremendous
enthusiasm
roused
by
great
composers
like
hassler
for
such
ovations
he
had
the
respect
which
he
always
paid
to
success
mingled
perhaps
with
a
little
secret
jealousy
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
such
applause
was
stolen
from
him
but
he
knew
by
experience
that
the
successes
of
the
great
are
no
less
remarkable
and
are
more
personal
in
character
and
therefore
more
fruitful
of
agreeable
and
flattering
consequences
he
affected
to
pay
profound
homage
to
the
genius
of
the
master
musicians
but
he
took
a
great
delight
in
telling
absurd
anecdotes
of
them
presenting
their
intelligence
and
morals
in
a
lamentable
light
he
placed
the
at
the
top
of
the
artistic
ladder
for
he
said
it
is
well
known
that
the
tongue
is
the
noblest
member
of
the
body
and
what
would
thought
be
without
words
what
would
music
be
without
the
executant
but
whatever
may
have
been
the
reason
for
the
scolding
that
he
gave
it
was
not
without
its
uses
in
restoring
some
common
sense
to
the
boy
who
was
almost
beside
himself
with
his
grandfather
praises
it
was
not
quite
enough
of
course
decided
that
his
grandfather
was
much
cleverer
than
his
father
and
though
he
sat
down
at
the
piano
without
sulking
he
did
so
not
so
much
for
the
sake
of
obedience
as
to
be
able
to
dream
in
peace
as
he
always
did
while
his
fingers
ran
mechanically
over
the
keyboard
while
he
played
his
interminable
exercises
he
heard
a
proud
voice
inside
himself
saying
over
and
over
again
i
am
a
composer
a
great
composer
from
that
day
on
since
he
was
a
composer
he
set
himself
to
composing
before
he
had
even
learned
to
write
he
continued
to
cipher
crotchets
and
quavers
on
scraps
of
paper
which
he
tore
from
the
household
but
in
the
effort
to
find
out
what
he
was
thinking
and
to
set
it
down
in
black
and
white
he
arrived
at
thinking
nothing
except
when
he
wanted
to
think
something
but
he
did
not
for
that
give
up
making
musical
phrases
and
as
he
was
a
born
musician
he
made
them
somehow
even
if
they
meant
nothing
at
all
then
he
would
take
them
in
triumph
to
his
grandfather
who
wept
with
joy
over
them
he
wept
easily
now
that
he
was
growing
old
and
vowed
that
they
were
wonderful
all
this
was
like
to
spoil
him
altogether
fortunately
his
own
good
sense
saved
him
helped
by
the
influence
of
a
man
who
made
no
pretension
of
having
any
influence
over
anybody
and
set
nothing
before
the
eyes
of
the
world
but
a
commonsense
point
of
view
this
man
was
louisa
brother
like
her
he
was
small
thin
puny
and
rather
no
one
knew
exactly
how
old
he
was
he
could
not
be
more
than
forty
but
he
looked
more
than
fifty
he
had
a
little
wrinkled
face
with
a
pink
complexion
and
kind
pale
blue
eyes
like
faded
when
he
took
off
his
cap
which
he
used
fussily
to
wear
everywhere
from
his
fear
of
draughts
he
exposed
a
little
pink
bald
head
conical
in
shape
which
was
the
great
delight
of
and
his
brothers
they
never
left
off
teasing
him
about
it
asking
him
what
he
had
done
with
his
hair
and
encouraged
by
melchior
pleasantries
threatening
to
smack
it
he
was
the
first
to
laugh
at
them
and
put
up
with
their
treatment
of
him
patiently
he
was
a
peddler
he
used
to
go
from
village
to
village
with
a
pack
on
his
back
containing
everything
groceries
stationery
confectionery
handkerchiefs
scarves
shoes
pickles
almanacs
songs
and
drugs
several
attempts
had
been
made
to
make
him
settle
down
and
to
buy
him
a
little
business
a
store
or
a
drapery
shop
but
he
could
not
do
it
one
night
he
would
get
up
push
the
key
under
the
door
and
set
off
again
with
his
pack
weeks
and
months
went
by
before
he
was
seen
again
then
he
would
reappear
some
evening
they
would
hear
him
fumbling
at
the
door
it
would
half
open
and
the
little
bald
head
politely
uncovered
would
appear
with
its
kind
eyes
and
timid
smile
he
would
say
everybody
carefully
wipe
his
shoes
before
entering
salute
everybody
beginning
with
the
eldest
and
go
and
sit
in
the
most
remote
corner
of
the
room
there
he
would
light
his
pipe
and
sit
huddled
up
waiting
quietly
until
the
usual
storm
of
questions
was
over
the
two
kraffts
father
and
grandfather
had
a
jeering
contempt
for
him
the
little
freak
seemed
ridiculous
to
them
and
their
pride
was
touched
by
the
low
degree
of
the
peddler
they
made
him
feel
it
but
he
seemed
to
take
no
notice
of
it
and
showed
them
a
profound
respect
which
disarmed
them
especially
the
old
man
who
was
very
sensitive
to
what
people
thought
of
him
they
used
to
crush
him
with
heavy
pleasantries
which
often
brought
the
blush
to
cheeks
accustomed
to
bow
without
dispute
to
the
intellectual
superiority
of
the
kraffts
she
had
no
doubt
that
her
husband
and
were
right
but
she
loved
her
brother
and
her
brother
had
for
her
a
dumb
adoration
they
were
the
only
members
of
their
family
and
they
were
both
humble
crushed
and
thrust
aside
by
life
they
were
united
in
sadness
and
tenderness
by
a
bond
of
mutual
pity
and
common
suffering
borne
in
secret
with
the
kraffts
robust
noisy
brutal
solidly
built
for
living
and
living
joyously
these
two
weak
kindly
creatures
out
of
their
setting
so
to
speak
outside
life
understood
and
pitied
each
other
without
ever
saying
anything
about
it
with
the
cruel
carelessness
of
childhood
shared
the
contempt
of
his
father
and
grandfather
for
the
little
peddler
he
made
fun
of
him
and
treated
him
as
a
comic
figure
he
worried
him
with
stupid
teasing
which
his
uncle
bore
with
his
unshakable
phlegm
but
loved
him
without
quite
knowing
why
he
loved
him
first
of
all
as
a
plaything
with
which
he
did
what
he
liked
he
loved
him
also
because
he
always
gave
him
something
nice
a
dainty
a
picture
an
amusing
toy
the
little
man
return
was
a
joy
for
the
children
for
he
always
had
some
surprise
for
them
poor
as
he
was
he
always
contrived
to
bring
them
each
a
present
and
he
never
forgot
the
birthday
of
any
one
of
the
family
he
always
turned
up
on
these
august
days
and
brought
out
of
his
pocket
some
jolly
present
lovingly
chosen
they
were
so
used
to
it
that
they
hardly
thought
of
thanking
him
it
seemed
natural
and
he
appeared
to
be
sufficiently
repaid
by
the
pleasure
he
had
given
but
who
did
not
sleep
very
well
and
during
the
night
used
to
turn
over
in
his
mind
the
events
of
the
day
used
sometimes
to
think
that
his
uncle
was
very
kind
and
he
used
to
be
filled
with
floods
of
gratitude
to
the
poor
man
he
never
showed
it
when
the
day
came
because
he
thought
that
the
others
would
laugh
at
him
besides
he
was
too
little
to
see
in
kindness
all
the
rare
value
that
it
has
in
the
language
of
children
kind
and
stupid
are
almost
synonymous
and
uncle
gottfried
seemed
to
be
the
living
proof
of
it
one
evening
when
melchior
was
dining
out
gottfried
was
left
alone
in
the
while
louisa
put
the
children
to
bed
he
went
out
and
sat
by
the
river
a
few
yards
away
from
the
house
having
nothing
better
to
do
followed
him
and
as
usual
tormented
him
with
his
puppy
tricks
until
he
was
out
of
breath
and
dropped
down
on
the
grass
at
his
feet
lying
on
his
belly
he
buried
his
nose
in
the
turf
when
he
had
recovered
his
breath
he
cast
about
for
some
new
crazy
thing
to
say
when
he
found
it
he
shouted
it
out
and
rolled
about
with
laughing
with
his
face
still
buried
in
the
earth
he
received
no
answer
surprised
by
the
silence
he
raised
his
head
and
began
to
repeat
his
joke
he
saw
gottfried
face
lit
up
by
the
last
beams
of
the
setting
sun
cast
through
golden
mists
he
swallowed
down
his
words
gottfried
smiled
with
his
eyes
half
closed
and
his
mouth
half
open
and
in
his
sorrowful
face
was
an
expression
of
sadness
and
unutterable
melancholy
with
his
face
in
his
hands
watched
him
the
night
came
little
by
little
gottfried
face
disappeared
silence
reigned
in
his
turn
was
filled
with
the
mysterious
impressions
which
had
been
reflected
on
gottfried
face
he
fell
into
a
vague
stupor
the
earth
was
in
darkness
the
sky
was
bright
the
stars
peeped
out
the
little
waves
of
the
river
chattered
against
the
bank
the
boy
grew
sleepy
without
seeing
them
he
bit
off
little
blades
of
grass
a
grasshopper
chirped
near
him
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
going
to
sleep
suddenly
in
the
dark
gottfried
began
to
sing
he
sang
in
a
weak
husky
voice
as
though
to
himself
he
could
not
have
been
heard
twenty
yards
away
but
there
was
sincerity
and
emotion
in
his
voice
it
was
as
though
he
were
thinking
aloud
and
that
through
the
song
as
through
clear
water
the
very
inmost
heart
of
him
was
to
be
seen
never
had
heard
such
singing
and
never
had
he
heard
such
a
song
slow
simple
childish
it
moved
gravely
sadly
a
little
monotonously
never
hurrying
with
long
pauses
then
setting
out
again
on
its
way
careless
where
it
arrived
and
losing
itself
in
the
night
it
seemed
to
come
from
far
away
and
it
went
no
man
knows
whither
its
serenity
was
full
of
sorrow
and
beneath
its
seeming
peace
there
dwelt
an
agony
of
the
ages
held
his
breath
he
dared
not
move
he
was
cold
with
emotion
when
it
was
done
he
crawled
towards
gottfried
and
in
a
choking
voice
said
uncle
gottfried
did
not
reply
uncle
repeated
the
boy
placing
his
hands
and
chin
on
gottfried
knees
gottfried
said
kindly
well
boy
what
is
it
uncle
tell
me
what
were
you
singing
i
do
know
tell
me
what
it
is
i
do
know
just
a
song
a
song
that
you
made
no
not
i
what
an
idea
it
is
an
old
song
who
made
it
no
one
knows
when
no
one
knows
when
you
were
little
before
i
was
born
before
my
father
was
born
and
before
his
father
and
before
his
father
father
it
has
always
been
how
strange
no
one
has
ever
told
me
about
it
he
thought
for
a
moment
uncle
do
you
know
any
other
yes
sing
another
please
why
should
i
sing
another
one
is
enough
one
sings
when
one
wants
to
sing
when
one
has
to
sing
one
must
not
sing
for
the
fun
of
it
but
what
about
when
one
makes
music
that
is
not
music
the
boy
was
lost
in
thought
he
did
not
quite
understand
but
he
asked
for
no
explanation
it
was
true
it
was
not
music
not
like
all
the
rest
he
went
on
uncle
have
you
ever
made
them
made
what
songs
songs
oh
how
should
i
make
them
they
ca
be
made
with
his
usual
logic
the
boy
insisted
but
uncle
it
must
have
been
made
once
gottfried
shook
his
head
obstinately
it
has
always
been
the
boy
returned
to
the
attack
but
uncle
is
it
possible
to
make
other
songs
new
songs
why
make
them
there
are
enough
for
everything
there
are
songs
for
when
you
are
sad
and
for
when
you
are
gay
for
when
you
are
weary
and
for
when
you
are
thinking
of
home
for
when
you
despise
yourself
because
you
have
been
a
vile
sinner
a
worm
upon
the
earth
for
when
you
want
to
weep
because
people
have
not
been
kind
to
you
and
for
when
your
heart
is
glad
because
the
world
is
beautiful
and
you
see
god
heaven
which
like
him
is
always
kind
and
seems
to
laugh
at
you
there
are
songs
for
everything
everything
why
should
i
make
them
to
be
a
great
man
said
the
boy
full
of
his
grandfather
teaching
and
his
simple
dreams
gottfried
laughed
softly
a
little
hurt
asked
him
why
are
you
laughing
gottfried
said
oh
i
i
am
nobody
he
kissed
the
boy
head
and
said
you
want
to
be
a
great
man
yes
said
proudly
he
thought
gottfried
would
admire
him
but
gottfried
replied
what
for
was
taken
aback
he
thought
for
a
moment
and
said
to
make
beautiful
songs
gottfried
laughed
again
and
said
you
want
to
make
beautiful
songs
so
as
to
be
a
great
man
and
you
want
to
be
a
great
man
so
as
to
make
beautiful
songs
you
are
like
a
dog
chasing
its
own
tail
was
dashed
at
any
other
time
he
would
not
have
borne
his
uncle
laughing
at
him
he
at
whom
he
was
used
to
laughing
and
at
the
same
time
he
would
never
have
thought
gottfried
clever
enough
to
stump
him
with
an
argument
he
cast
about
for
some
answer
or
some
impertinence
to
throw
at
him
but
could
find
none
gottfried
went
on
when
you
are
as
great
as
from
here
to
coblentz
you
will
never
make
a
single
song
revolted
on
that
and
if
i
will
the
more
you
want
to
the
less
you
can
to
make
songs
you
have
to
be
like
those
creatures
listen
the
moon
had
risen
round
and
gleaming
behind
the
fields
a
silvery
mist
hovered
above
the
ground
and
the
shimmering
waters
the
frogs
croaked
and
in
the
meadows
the
melodious
fluting
of
the
toads
arose
the
shrill
tremolo
of
the
grasshoppers
seemed
to
answer
the
twinkling
of
the
stars
the
wind
rustled
softly
in
the
branches
of
the
alders
from
the
hills
above
the
river
there
came
down
the
sweet
light
song
of
a
nightingale
what
need
is
there
to
sing
sighed
gottfried
after
a
long
silence
it
was
not
clear
whether
he
were
talking
to
himself
or
to
do
they
sing
sweeter
than
anything
that
you
could
make
had
often
heard
these
sounds
of
the
night
and
he
loved
them
but
never
had
he
heard
them
as
he
heard
them
now
it
was
true
what
need
was
there
to
sing
his
heart
was
full
of
tenderness
and
sorrow
he
was
fain
to
embrace
the
meadows
the
river
the
sky
the
clear
stars
he
was
filled
with
love
for
his
uncle
gottfried
who
seemed
to
him
now
the
best
the
cleverest
the
most
beautiful
of
men
he
thought
how
he
had
misjudged
him
and
he
thought
that
his
uncle
was
sad
because
he
had
misjudged
him
he
was
remorseful
he
wanted
to
cry
out
uncle
do
not
be
sad
i
will
not
be
naughty
again
forgive
me
i
love
you
but
he
dared
not
and
suddenly
he
threw
himself
into
arms
but
the
words
would
not
come
only
he
repeated
i
love
you
and
kissed
him
passionately
gottfried
was
surprised
and
touched
and
went
on
saying
what
what
and
kissed
him
then
he
got
up
took
him
by
the
hand
and
said
we
must
go
in
was
sad
because
his
uncle
had
not
understood
him
but
as
they
came
to
the
house
gottfried
said
if
you
like
we
go
again
to
hear
god
music
and
i
will
sing
you
some
more
songs
and
when
kissed
him
gratefully
as
they
said
he
saw
that
his
uncle
had
understood
thereafter
they
often
went
for
walks
together
in
the
evening
and
they
walked
without
a
word
along
by
the
river
or
through
the
fields
gottfried
slowly
smoked
his
pipe
and
a
little
frightened
by
the
darkness
would
give
him
his
hand
they
would
sit
down
on
the
grass
and
after
a
few
moments
of
silence
gottfried
would
talk
to
him
about
the
stars
and
the
clouds
he
taught
him
to
distinguish
the
breathing
of
the
earth
air
and
water
the
songs
cries
and
sounds
of
the
little
worlds
of
flying
creeping
hopping
and
swimming
things
swarming
in
the
darkness
and
the
signs
of
rain
and
fine
weather
and
the
countless
instruments
of
the
symphony
of
the
night
sometimes
gottfried
would
sing
tunes
sad
or
gay
but
always
of
the
same
kind
and
always
in
the
end
would
be
brought
to
the
same
sorrow
but
he
would
never
sing
more
than
one
song
in
an
evening
and
noticed
that
he
did
not
sing
gladly
when
he
was
asked
to
do
so
it
had
to
come
of
itself
just
when
he
wanted
to
sometimes
they
had
to
wait
for
a
long
time
without
speaking
and
just
when
was
beginning
to
think
he
is
not
going
to
sing
this
evening
gottfried
would
make
up
his
mind
one
evening
when
nothing
would
induce
gottfried
to
sing
thought
of
submitting
to
him
one
of
his
own
small
compositions
in
the
making
of
which
he
found
so
much
trouble
and
pride
he
wanted
to
show
what
an
artist
he
was
gottfried
listened
very
quietly
and
then
said
that
is
very
ugly
my
poor
dear
was
so
hurt
that
he
could
find
nothing
to
say
gottfried
went
on
pityingly
why
did
you
do
it
it
is
so
ugly
no
one
forced
you
to
do
it
hot
with
anger
protested
my
grandfather
thinks
my
music
fine
ah
said
gottfried
not
turning
a
hair
no
doubt
he
is
right
he
is
a
learned
man
he
knows
all
about
music
i
know
nothing
about
it
and
after
a
moment
but
i
think
that
is
very
ugly
he
looked
quietly
at
and
saw
his
angry
face
and
smiled
and
said
have
you
composed
any
others
perhaps
i
shall
like
the
others
better
than
that
thought
that
his
other
compositions
might
wipe
out
the
impression
of
the
first
and
he
sang
them
all
gottfried
said
nothing
he
waited
until
they
were
finished
then
he
shook
his
head
and
with
profound
conviction
said
they
are
even
more
ugly
shut
his
lips
and
his
chin
trembled
he
wanted
to
cry
gottfried
went
on
as
though
he
himself
were
upset
how
ugly
they
are
with
tears
in
his
voice
cried
out
but
why
do
you
say
they
are
ugly
gottfried
looked
at
him
with
his
frank
eyes
why
i
do
know
wait
they
are
ugly
first
because
they
are
stupid
yes
that
it
they
are
stupid
they
do
mean
anything
you
see
when
you
wrote
you
had
nothing
to
say
why
did
you
write
them
i
do
know
said
in
a
piteous
voice
i
wanted
to
write
something
pretty
there
you
are
you
wrote
for
the
sake
of
writing
you
wrote
because
you
wanted
to
be
a
great
musician
and
to
be
admired
you
have
been
proud
you
have
been
a
liar
you
have
been
punished
you
see
a
man
is
always
punished
when
he
is
proud
and
a
liar
in
music
music
must
be
modest
and
sincere
or
else
what
is
it
impious
a
blasphemy
of
the
lord
who
has
given
us
song
to
tell
the
honest
truth
he
saw
the
boy
distress
and
tried
to
kiss
him
but
turned
angrily
away
and
for
several
days
he
sulked
he
hated
gottfried
but
it
was
in
vain
that
he
said
over
and
over
to
himself
he
is
an
ass
he
knows
nothing
nothing
my
grandfather
who
is
much
cleverer
likes
my
music
in
his
heart
he
knew
that
his
uncle
was
right
and
words
were
graven
on
his
inmost
soul
he
was
ashamed
to
have
been
a
liar
and
in
spite
of
his
resentment
he
always
thought
of
it
when
he
was
writing
music
and
often
he
tore
up
what
he
had
written
being
ashamed
already
of
what
gottfried
would
have
thought
of
it
when
he
got
over
it
and
wrote
a
melody
which
he
knew
to
be
not
quite
sincere
he
hid
it
carefully
from
his
uncle
he
was
fearful
of
his
judgment
and
was
quite
happy
when
gottfried
just
said
of
one
of
his
pieces
that
is
not
so
very
ugly
i
like
it
sometimes
by
way
of
revenge
he
used
to
trick
him
by
giving
him
as
his
own
melodies
from
the
great
musicians
and
he
was
delighted
when
it
happened
that
gottfried
disliked
them
heartily
but
that
did
not
trouble
gottfried
he
would
laugh
loudly
when
he
saw
clap
his
hands
and
dance
about
him
delightedly
and
he
always
returned
to
his
usual
argument
it
is
well
enough
written
but
it
says
nothing
he
always
refused
to
be
present
at
one
of
the
little
concerts
given
in
melchior
house
however
beautiful
the
music
might
be
he
would
begin
to
yawn
and
look
sleepy
with
boredom
very
soon
he
would
be
unable
to
bear
it
any
longer
and
would
steal
away
quietly
he
used
to
say
you
see
my
boy
everything
that
you
write
in
the
house
is
not
music
music
in
a
house
is
like
sunshine
in
a
room
music
is
to
be
found
outside
where
you
breathe
god
dear
fresh
air
he
was
always
talking
of
god
for
he
was
very
pious
unlike
the
two
kraffts
father
and
son
who
were
and
took
care
to
eat
meat
on
fridays
suddenly
for
no
apparent
reason
melchior
changed
his
opinion
not
only
did
he
approve
of
his
father
having
put
together
inspirations
but
to
the
boy
great
surprise
he
spent
several
evenings
in
making
two
or
three
copies
of
his
manuscript
to
every
question
put
to
him
on
the
subject
he
replied
impressively
we
shall
see
or
he
would
rub
his
hands
and
laugh
smack
the
boy
head
by
way
of
a
joke
or
turn
him
up
and
blithely
spank
him
loathed
these
familiarities
but
he
saw
that
his
father
was
pleased
and
did
not
know
why
then
there
were
mysterious
confabulations
between
melchior
and
his
father
and
one
evening
to
his
astonishment
learned
that
he
had
dedicated
to
the
grand
duke
leopold
the
of
melchior
had
sounded
the
disposition
of
the
prince
who
had
shown
himself
graciously
inclined
to
accept
the
homage
thereupon
melchior
declared
that
without
losing
a
moment
they
must
draw
up
the
official
request
to
the
prince
publish
the
work
organize
a
concert
to
give
it
a
hearing
there
were
further
long
conferences
between
melchior
and
jean
michel
they
argued
heatedly
for
two
or
three
evenings
it
was
forbidden
to
interrupt
them
melchior
wrote
erased
erased
wrote
the
old
man
talked
loudly
as
though
he
were
reciting
verses
sometimes
they
squabbled
or
thumped
on
the
table
because
they
could
not
find
a
word
then
was
called
made
to
sit
at
the
table
with
a
pen
in
his
hand
his
father
on
his
right
his
grandfather
on
his
left
and
the
old
man
began
to
dictate
words
which
he
did
not
understand
because
he
found
it
difficult
to
write
every
word
in
his
enormous
letters
because
melchior
was
shouting
in
his
ear
and
because
the
old
man
declaimed
with
such
emphasis
that
put
out
by
the
sound
of
the
words
could
not
bother
to
listen
to
their
meaning
the
old
man
was
no
less
in
a
state
of
emotion
he
could
not
sit
still
and
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
involuntarily
illustrating
the
text
of
what
he
read
with
gestures
but
he
came
every
minute
to
look
over
what
the
boy
had
written
and
frightened
by
the
two
large
faces
looking
over
his
shoulder
put
out
his
tongue
and
held
his
pen
clumsily
a
mist
floated
before
his
eyes
he
made
too
many
strokes
or
smudged
what
he
had
written
and
melchior
roared
and
jean
michel
stormed
and
he
had
to
begin
again
and
then
again
and
when
he
thought
that
they
had
at
last
come
to
an
end
a
great
blot
fell
on
the
immaculate
page
then
they
pulled
his
ears
and
he
burst
into
tears
but
they
forbade
him
to
weep
because
he
was
spoiling
the
paper
and
they
began
to
dictate
beginning
all
over
again
and
he
thought
it
would
go
on
like
that
to
the
end
of
his
life
at
last
it
was
finished
and
jean
michel
leaned
against
the
mantelpiece
and
read
over
their
handiwork
in
a
voice
trembling
with
pleasure
while
melchior
sat
straddled
across
a
chair
and
looked
at
the
ceiling
and
wagged
his
chair
and
as
a
connoisseur
rolled
round
his
tongue
the
style
of
the
following
epistle
noble
and
sublime
highness
most
gracious
lord
from
my
fourth
year
music
has
been
the
first
occupation
of
my
childish
days
so
soon
as
i
allied
myself
to
the
noble
muse
who
roused
my
soul
to
pure
harmony
i
loved
her
and
as
it
seemed
to
me
she
returned
my
love
now
i
am
in
my
sixth
year
and
for
some
time
my
muse
in
hours
of
inspiration
has
whispered
in
my
ears
bold
be
bold
write
down
the
harmonies
of
thy
soul
years
old
thought
i
how
should
i
be
bold
what
would
the
learned
in
the
art
say
of
me
i
hesitated
i
trembled
but
my
muse
insisted
i
obeyed
i
wrote
and
now
shall
i
most
sublime
highness
shall
i
have
the
temerity
and
audacity
to
place
upon
the
steps
of
thy
throne
the
of
my
youthful
labors
shall
i
make
so
bold
as
to
hope
that
thou
wilt
let
fall
upon
them
the
august
approbation
of
thy
paternal
regard
oh
yes
for
science
and
the
arts
have
ever
found
in
thee
their
sage
mæcenas
their
generous
champion
and
talent
puts
forth
its
flowers
under
the
ægis
of
thy
holy
protection
in
this
profound
and
certain
faith
i
dare
then
approach
thee
with
these
youthful
efforts
receive
them
as
a
pure
offering
of
my
childish
veneration
and
of
thy
goodness
deign
most
sublime
highness
to
glance
at
them
and
at
their
young
author
who
bows
at
thy
feet
deeply
and
in
humility
the
most
submissive
faithful
and
obedient
servant
of
his
most
noble
and
most
sublime
krafft
heard
nothing
he
was
very
happy
to
have
finished
and
fearing
that
he
would
be
made
to
begin
again
he
ran
away
to
the
fields
he
had
no
idea
of
what
he
had
written
and
he
cared
not
at
all
but
when
the
old
man
had
finished
his
reading
he
began
again
to
taste
the
full
flavor
of
it
and
when
the
second
reading
came
to
an
end
melchior
and
he
declared
that
it
was
a
little
masterpiece
that
was
also
the
opinion
of
the
grand
duke
to
whom
the
letter
was
presented
with
a
copy
of
the
musical
work
he
was
kind
enough
to
send
word
that
he
found
both
quite
charming
he
granted
permission
for
the
concert
and
ordered
that
the
hall
of
his
academy
of
music
should
be
put
at
melchior
disposal
and
deigned
to
promise
that
he
would
have
the
young
artist
presented
to
himself
on
the
day
of
the
performance
melchior
set
about
organizing
the
concert
as
quickly
as
possible
he
engaged
the
support
of
the
musik
and
as
the
success
of
his
first
ventures
had
blown
out
his
sense
of
proportion
he
undertook
at
the
same
time
to
publish
a
magnificent
edition
of
the
of
he
wanted
to
have
printed
on
the
cover
of
it
a
portrait
of
at
the
piano
with
himself
melchior
standing
by
his
side
violin
in
hand
he
had
to
abandon
that
not
on
account
of
the
cost
melchior
did
not
stop
at
any
expense
but
because
there
was
not
time
enough
he
fell
back
on
an
allegorical
design
representing
a
cradle
a
trumpet
a
drum
a
wooden
horse
grouped
round
a
lyre
which
put
forth
rays
like
the
sun
the
bore
together
with
a
long
dedication
in
which
the
name
of
the
prince
stood
out
in
enormous
letters
a
notice
to
the
effect
that
herr
krafft
was
six
years
old
he
was
in
fact
seven
and
a
half
the
printing
of
the
design
was
very
expensive
to
meet
the
bill
for
it
jean
michel
had
to
sell
an
old
chest
carved
with
faces
which
he
had
never
consented
to
sell
in
spite
of
the
repeated
offers
of
wormser
the
but
melchior
had
no
doubt
but
the
subscriptions
would
cover
the
cost
and
beyond
that
the
expenses
of
printing
the
composition
one
other
question
occupied
his
mind
how
to
dress
on
the
day
of
the
concert
there
was
a
family
council
to
decide
the
matter
melchior
would
have
liked
the
boy
to
appear
in
a
short
frock
and
bare
legs
like
a
child
of
four
but
was
very
large
for
his
age
and
everybody
knew
him
they
could
not
hope
to
deceive
any
one
melchior
had
a
great
idea
he
decided
that
the
boy
should
wear
a
and
white
tie
in
vain
did
louisa
protest
that
they
would
make
her
poor
boy
ridiculous
melchior
anticipated
exactly
the
success
and
merriment
that
would
be
produced
by
such
an
unexpected
appearance
it
was
decided
on
and
the
tailor
came
and
measured
for
his
little
coat
he
had
also
to
have
fine
linen
and
pumps
and
all
that
swallowed
up
their
last
penny
was
very
uncomfortable
in
his
new
clothes
to
make
him
used
to
them
they
made
him
try
on
his
various
garments
for
a
whole
month
he
hardly
left
the
they
taught
him
to
bow
he
had
never
a
moment
of
liberty
he
raged
against
it
but
dared
not
rebel
for
he
thought
that
he
was
going
to
accomplish
something
startling
he
was
both
proud
and
afraid
of
it
they
pampered
him
they
were
afraid
he
would
catch
cold
they
swathed
his
neck
in
scarves
they
warmed
his
boots
in
case
they
were
wet
and
at
table
he
had
the
best
of
everything
at
last
the
great
day
arrived
the
barber
came
to
preside
over
his
toilet
and
curl
rebellious
hair
he
did
not
leave
it
until
he
had
made
it
look
like
a
all
the
family
walked
round
and
declared
that
he
was
superb
melchior
after
looking
him
up
and
down
and
turning
him
about
and
about
was
seized
with
an
idea
and
went
off
to
fetch
a
large
flower
which
he
put
in
his
buttonhole
but
when
louisa
saw
him
she
raised
her
hands
and
cried
out
distressfully
that
he
looked
like
a
monkey
that
hurt
him
cruelly
he
did
not
know
whether
to
be
ashamed
or
proud
of
his
garb
instinctively
he
felt
humiliated
and
he
was
more
so
at
the
concert
humiliation
was
to
be
for
him
the
outstanding
emotion
of
that
memorable
day
the
concert
was
about
to
begin
the
hall
was
half
empty
the
grand
duke
had
not
arrived
one
of
those
kindly
and
friends
who
always
appear
on
these
occasions
came
and
told
them
that
there
was
a
council
being
held
at
the
palace
and
that
the
grand
duke
would
not
come
he
had
it
on
good
authority
melchior
was
in
despair
he
fidgeted
paced
up
and
down
and
looked
repeatedly
out
of
the
window
old
jean
michel
was
also
in
torment
but
he
was
concerned
for
his
grandson
he
bombarded
him
with
instructions
was
infected
by
the
nervousness
of
his
family
he
was
not
in
the
least
anxious
about
his
compositions
but
he
was
troubled
by
the
thought
of
the
bows
that
he
had
to
make
to
the
audience
and
thinking
of
them
brought
him
to
agony
however
he
had
to
begin
the
audience
was
growing
impatient
the
orchestra
of
the
musik
began
the
the
boy
knew
neither
coriolan
nor
beethoven
for
though
he
had
often
heard
music
he
had
not
known
it
he
never
bothered
about
the
names
of
the
works
he
heard
he
gave
them
names
of
his
own
invention
while
he
created
little
stories
or
pictures
for
them
he
classified
them
usually
in
three
categories
fire
water
and
earth
with
a
thousand
degrees
between
each
mozart
belonged
almost
always
to
water
he
was
a
meadow
by
the
side
of
a
river
a
transparent
mist
floating
over
the
water
a
spring
shower
or
a
rainbow
beethoven
was
fire
now
a
furnace
with
gigantic
flames
and
vast
columns
of
smoke
now
a
burning
forest
a
heavy
and
terrible
cloud
flashing
lightning
now
a
wide
sky
full
of
quivering
stars
one
of
which
breaks
free
swoops
and
dies
on
a
fine
september
night
setting
the
heart
beating
now
the
imperious
ardor
of
that
heroic
soul
burned
him
like
fire
everything
else
disappeared
what
was
it
all
to
him
melchior
in
despair
jean
michel
agitated
all
the
busy
world
the
audience
the
grand
duke
little
what
had
he
to
do
with
all
these
what
lay
between
them
and
him
was
that
he
he
himself
he
was
given
up
to
the
furious
will
that
carried
him
headlong
he
followed
it
breathlessly
with
tears
in
his
eyes
and
his
legs
numb
thrilling
from
the
palms
of
his
hands
to
the
soles
of
his
feet
his
blood
drummed
charge
and
he
trembled
in
every
limb
and
as
he
listened
so
intensely
hiding
behind
a
curtain
his
heart
suddenly
leaped
violently
the
orchestra
had
stopped
short
in
the
middle
of
a
bar
and
after
a
moment
silence
it
broke
into
a
crashing
of
brass
and
cymbals
with
a
military
march
officially
strident
the
transition
from
one
sort
of
music
to
another
was
so
brutal
so
unexpected
that
ground
his
teeth
and
stamped
his
foot
with
rage
and
shook
his
fist
at
the
wall
but
melchior
rejoiced
the
grand
duke
had
come
in
and
the
orchestra
was
saluting
him
with
the
national
anthem
and
in
a
trembling
voice
jean
michel
gave
his
last
instructions
to
his
grandson
the
overture
began
again
and
this
time
was
finished
it
was
now
turn
melchior
had
arranged
the
programme
to
show
off
at
the
same
time
the
skill
of
both
father
and
son
they
were
to
play
together
a
sonata
of
mozart
for
violin
and
piano
for
the
sake
of
effect
he
had
decided
that
should
enter
alone
he
was
led
to
the
entrance
of
the
stage
and
showed
the
piano
at
the
front
and
for
the
last
time
it
was
explained
what
he
had
to
do
and
then
he
was
pushed
on
from
the
wings
he
was
not
much
afraid
for
he
was
used
to
the
theater
but
when
he
found
himself
alone
on
the
platform
with
hundreds
of
eyes
staring
at
him
he
became
suddenly
so
frightened
that
instinctively
he
moved
backwards
and
turned
towards
the
wings
to
go
back
again
he
saw
his
father
there
gesticulating
and
with
his
eyes
blazing
he
had
to
go
on
besides
the
audience
had
seen
him
as
he
advanced
there
arose
a
twittering
of
curiosity
followed
soon
by
laughter
which
grew
louder
and
louder
melchior
had
not
been
wrong
and
the
boy
garb
had
all
the
effect
anticipated
the
audience
rocked
with
laughter
at
the
sight
of
the
child
with
his
long
hair
and
gipsy
complexion
timidly
trotting
across
the
platform
in
the
evening
dress
of
a
man
of
the
world
they
got
up
to
see
him
better
soon
the
hilarity
was
general
there
was
nothing
unkindly
in
it
but
it
would
have
made
the
most
hardened
musician
lose
his
head
terrified
by
the
noise
and
the
eyes
watching
and
the
glasses
turned
upon
him
had
only
one
idea
to
reach
the
piano
as
quickly
as
possible
for
it
seemed
to
him
a
refuge
an
island
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
with
head
down
looking
neither
to
right
nor
left
he
ran
quickly
across
the
platform
and
when
he
reached
the
middle
of
it
instead
of
bowing
to
the
audience
as
had
been
arranged
he
turned
his
back
on
it
and
plunged
straight
for
the
piano
the
chair
was
too
high
for
him
to
sit
down
without
his
father
help
and
in
his
distress
instead
of
waiting
he
climbed
up
on
to
it
on
his
knees
that
increased
the
merriment
of
the
audience
but
now
was
safe
sitting
at
his
instrument
he
was
afraid
of
no
one
melchior
came
at
last
he
gained
by
the
of
the
audience
who
welcomed
him
with
warm
applause
the
sonata
began
the
boy
played
it
with
imperturbable
certainty
with
his
lips
pressed
tight
in
concentration
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
keys
his
little
legs
hanging
down
from
the
chair
he
became
more
at
ease
as
the
notes
rolled
out
he
was
among
friends
that
he
knew
a
murmur
of
approbation
reached
him
and
waves
of
pride
and
satisfaction
surged
through
him
as
he
thought
that
all
these
people
were
silent
to
listen
to
him
and
to
admire
him
but
hardly
had
he
finished
when
fear
overcame
him
again
and
the
applause
which
greeted
him
gave
him
more
shame
than
pleasure
his
shame
increased
when
melchior
took
him
by
the
hand
and
advanced
with
him
to
the
edge
of
the
platform
and
made
him
bow
to
the
public
he
obeyed
and
bowed
very
low
with
a
funny
awkwardness
but
he
was
humiliated
and
blushed
for
what
he
had
done
as
though
it
were
a
thing
ridiculous
and
ugly
he
had
to
sit
at
the
piano
again
and
he
played
the
of
then
the
audience
was
enraptured
after
each
piece
they
shouted
enthusiastically
they
wanted
him
to
begin
again
and
he
was
proud
of
his
success
and
at
the
same
time
almost
hurt
by
such
applause
which
was
also
a
command
at
the
end
the
whole
audience
rose
to
acclaim
him
the
grand
duke
led
the
applause
but
as
was
now
alone
on
the
platform
he
dared
not
budge
from
his
seat
the
applause
redoubled
he
bent
his
head
lower
and
lower
blushing
and
in
expression
and
he
looked
steadily
away
from
the
audience
melchior
came
he
took
him
in
his
arms
and
told
him
to
blow
kisses
he
pointed
out
to
him
the
grand
duke
box
turned
a
deaf
ear
melchior
took
his
arm
and
threatened
him
in
a
low
voice
then
he
did
as
he
was
told
passively
but
he
did
not
look
at
anybody
he
did
not
raise
his
eyes
but
went
on
turning
his
head
away
and
he
was
unhappy
he
was
suffering
how
he
did
not
know
his
vanity
was
suffering
he
did
not
like
the
people
who
were
there
at
all
it
was
no
use
their
applauding
he
could
not
forgive
them
for
having
laughed
and
for
being
amused
by
his
humiliation
he
could
not
forgive
them
for
having
seen
him
in
such
a
ridiculous
position
held
in
to
blow
kisses
he
disliked
them
even
for
applauding
and
when
melchior
did
at
last
put
him
down
he
ran
away
to
the
wings
a
lady
threw
a
bunch
of
violets
up
at
him
as
he
went
it
brushed
his
face
he
was
and
ran
as
fast
as
he
could
turning
over
a
chair
that
was
in
his
way
the
faster
he
ran
the
more
they
laughed
and
the
more
they
laughed
the
faster
he
ran
at
last
he
reached
the
exit
which
was
filled
with
people
looking
at
him
he
forced
his
way
through
butting
and
ran
and
hid
himself
at
the
back
of
the
anteroom
his
grandfather
was
in
high
feather
and
covered
him
with
blessings
the
musicians
of
the
orchestra
shouted
with
laughter
and
congratulated
the
boy
who
refused
to
look
at
them
or
to
shake
hands
with
them
melchior
listened
intently
gaging
the
applause
which
had
not
yet
ceased
and
wanted
to
take
on
to
the
stage
again
but
the
boy
refused
angrily
clung
to
his
grandfather
and
kicked
at
everybody
who
came
near
him
at
last
he
burst
into
tears
and
they
had
to
let
him
be
just
at
this
moment
an
officer
came
to
say
that
the
grand
duke
wished
the
artists
to
go
to
his
box
how
could
the
child
be
presented
in
such
a
state
melchior
swore
angrily
and
his
wrath
only
had
the
effect
of
making
tears
flow
faster
to
stop
them
his
grandfather
promised
him
a
pound
of
chocolates
if
he
would
not
cry
any
more
and
who
was
greedy
stopped
dead
swallowed
down
his
tears
and
let
them
carry
him
off
but
they
had
to
swear
at
first
most
solemnly
that
they
would
not
take
him
on
to
the
platform
again
in
the
anteroom
of
the
grand
ducal
box
he
was
presented
to
a
gentleman
in
a
with
a
face
like
a
bristling
mustaches
and
a
short
pointed
beard
a
little
man
inclined
to
stoutness
who
addressed
him
with
bantering
familiarity
and
called
him
mozart
this
was
the
grand
duke
then
he
was
presented
in
turn
to
the
grand
duchess
and
her
daughter
and
their
suite
but
as
he
did
not
dare
raise
his
eyes
the
only
thing
he
could
remember
of
this
brilliant
company
was
a
series
of
gowns
and
uniforms
from
the
waist
down
to
the
feet
he
sat
on
the
lap
of
the
young
princess
and
dared
not
move
or
breathe
she
asked
him
questions
which
melchior
answered
in
an
obsequious
voice
with
formal
replies
respectful
and
servile
but
she
did
not
listen
to
melchior
and
went
on
teasing
the
child
he
grew
redder
and
redder
and
thinking
that
everybody
must
have
noticed
it
he
thought
he
must
explain
it
away
and
said
with
a
long
sigh
my
face
is
red
i
am
hot
that
made
the
girl
shout
with
laughter
but
did
not
mind
it
in
her
as
he
had
in
his
audience
just
before
for
her
laughter
was
pleasant
and
she
kissed
him
and
he
did
not
dislike
that
then
he
saw
his
grandfather
in
the
passage
at
the
door
of
the
box
beaming
and
bashful
the
old
man
was
fain
to
show
himself
and
also
to
say
a
few
words
but
he
dared
not
because
no
one
had
spoken
to
him
he
was
enjoying
his
grandson
glory
at
a
distance
became
tender
and
felt
an
irresistible
impulse
to
procure
justice
also
for
the
old
man
so
that
they
should
know
his
worth
his
tongue
was
loosed
and
he
reached
up
to
the
ear
of
his
new
friend
and
whispered
to
her
i
will
tell
you
a
secret
she
laughed
and
said
what
you
know
he
went
on
you
know
the
pretty
in
my
the
i
played
you
know
it
he
hummed
it
gently
well
grandfather
wrote
it
not
i
all
the
other
airs
are
mine
but
that
is
the
best
grandfather
wrote
it
grandfather
did
not
want
me
to
say
anything
you
wo
tell
anybody
he
pointed
out
the
old
man
that
is
my
grandfather
i
love
him
he
is
very
kind
to
me
at
that
the
young
princess
laughed
again
said
that
he
was
a
darling
covered
him
with
kisses
and
to
the
consternation
of
and
his
grandfather
told
everybody
everybody
laughed
then
and
the
grand
duke
congratulated
the
old
man
who
was
covered
with
confusion
tried
in
vain
to
explain
himself
and
stammered
like
a
guilty
criminal
but
said
not
another
word
to
the
girl
and
in
spite
of
her
wheedling
he
remained
dumb
and
stiff
he
despised
her
for
having
broken
her
promise
his
idea
of
princes
suffered
considerably
from
this
disloyalty
he
was
so
angry
about
it
that
he
did
not
hear
anything
that
was
said
or
that
the
prince
had
appointed
him
laughingly
his
pianist
in
ordinary
his
he
went
out
with
his
relatives
and
found
himself
surrounded
in
the
corridors
of
the
theater
and
even
in
the
street
with
people
congratulating
him
or
kissing
him
that
displeased
him
greatly
for
he
did
not
like
being
kissed
and
did
not
like
people
meddling
with
him
without
asking
his
permission
at
last
they
reached
home
and
then
hardly
was
the
door
closed
than
melchior
began
to
call
him
a
little
idiot
because
he
had
said
that
the
was
not
his
own
as
the
boy
was
under
the
impression
that
he
had
done
a
fine
thing
which
deserved
praise
and
not
blame
he
rebelled
and
was
impertinent
melchior
lost
his
temper
and
said
that
he
would
box
his
ears
although
he
had
played
his
music
well
enough
because
with
his
idiocy
he
had
spoiled
the
whole
effect
of
the
concert
had
a
profound
sense
of
justice
he
went
and
sulked
in
a
corner
he
visited
his
contempt
upon
his
father
the
princess
and
the
whole
world
he
was
hurt
also
because
the
neighbors
came
and
congratulated
his
parents
and
laughed
with
them
as
if
it
were
they
who
had
played
and
as
if
it
were
their
affair
at
this
moment
a
servant
of
the
court
came
with
a
beautiful
gold
watch
from
the
grand
duke
and
a
box
of
lovely
sweets
from
the
young
princess
both
presents
gave
great
pleasure
to
and
he
did
not
know
which
gave
him
the
more
but
he
was
in
such
a
bad
temper
that
he
would
not
admit
it
to
himself
and
he
went
on
sulking
scowling
at
the
sweets
and
wondering
whether
he
could
properly
accept
a
gift
from
a
person
who
had
betrayed
his
confidence
as
he
was
on
the
point
of
giving
in
his
father
wanted
to
set
him
down
at
once
at
the
table
and
make
him
write
at
his
dictation
a
letter
of
thanks
this
was
too
much
either
from
the
nervous
strain
of
the
day
or
from
instinctive
shame
at
beginning
the
letter
as
melchior
wanted
him
to
with
the
words
the
little
servant
and
musician
und
of
your
highness
he
burst
into
tears
and
was
inconsolable
the
servant
waited
and
scoffed
melchior
had
to
write
the
letter
that
did
not
make
him
exactly
kindly
disposed
towards
as
a
crowning
misfortune
the
boy
let
his
watch
fall
and
broke
it
a
storm
of
reproaches
broke
upon
him
melchior
shouted
that
he
would
have
to
go
without
dessert
said
angrily
that
that
was
what
he
wanted
to
punish
him
louisa
said
that
she
would
begin
by
confiscating
his
sweets
was
up
in
arms
at
that
and
said
that
the
box
was
his
and
no
one
else
and
that
no
one
should
take
it
away
from
him
he
was
smacked
and
in
a
fit
of
anger
snatched
the
box
from
his
mother
hands
hurled
it
on
the
floor
and
stamped
on
it
he
was
whipped
taken
to
his
room
undressed
and
put
to
bed
in
the
evening
he
heard
his
parents
dining
with
friends
a
magnificent
repast
prepared
a
week
before
in
honor
of
the
concert
he
was
like
to
die
with
wrath
at
such
injustice
they
laughed
loudly
and
touched
glasses
they
had
told
the
guests
that
the
boy
was
tired
and
no
one
bothered
about
him
only
after
dinner
when
the
party
was
breaking
up
he
heard
a
slow
shuffling
step
come
into
his
room
and
old
jean
michel
bent
over
his
bed
and
kissed
him
and
said
dear
little
then
as
if
he
were
ashamed
he
went
away
without
another
word
he
had
slipped
into
his
hand
some
sweetmeats
which
he
had
hidden
in
his
pocket
that
softened
but
he
was
so
tired
with
all
the
emotions
that
he
had
not
the
strength
to
think
about
what
his
grandfather
had
done
he
had
not
even
the
strength
to
reach
out
to
the
good
things
the
old
man
had
given
him
he
was
worn
out
and
went
to
sleep
almost
at
once
his
sleep
was
light
he
had
acute
nervous
attacks
like
electric
shocks
which
shook
his
whole
body
in
his
dreams
he
was
haunted
by
wild
music
he
awoke
in
the
night
the
beethoven
overture
that
he
had
heard
at
the
concert
was
roaring
in
his
ears
it
filled
the
room
with
its
mighty
beat
he
sat
up
in
his
bed
rubbed
his
eyes
and
ears
and
asked
himself
if
he
were
asleep
no
he
was
not
asleep
he
recognized
the
sound
he
recognized
those
roars
of
anger
those
savage
cries
he
heard
the
throbbing
of
that
passionate
heart
leaping
in
his
bosom
that
tumult
of
the
blood
he
felt
on
his
face
the
frantic
heating
of
the
wind
lashing
and
destroying
then
stopping
suddenly
cut
off
by
an
herculean
will
that
titanic
soul
entered
his
body
blew
out
his
limbs
and
his
soul
and
seemed
to
give
them
colossal
proportions
he
strode
over
all
the
world
he
was
like
a
mountain
and
storms
raged
within
him
storms
of
wrath
storms
of
sorrow
ah
what
sorrow
but
they
were
nothing
he
felt
so
strong
to
suffer
still
to
suffer
ah
how
good
it
is
to
be
strong
how
good
it
is
to
suffer
when
a
man
is
strong
he
laughed
his
laughter
rang
out
in
the
silence
of
the
night
his
father
woke
up
and
cried
who
is
there
his
mother
whispered
ssh
the
boy
is
dreaming
all
then
were
silent
round
them
all
was
silence
the
music
died
away
and
nothing
sounded
but
the
regular
breathing
of
the
human
creatures
asleep
in
the
room
comrades
in
misery
thrown
together
by
fate
in
the
same
frail
barque
bound
onwards
by
a
wild
whirling
force
through
the
night
letter
to
the
grand
duke
leopold
is
inspired
by
beethoven
letter
to
the
prince
elector
of
bonn
written
when
he
was
eleven
morning
i
the
death
of
jean
michel
years
have
passed
is
nearly
eleven
his
musical
education
is
proceeding
he
is
learning
harmony
with
florian
holzer
the
organist
of
martin
a
friend
of
his
grandfather
a
very
learned
man
who
teaches
him
that
the
chords
and
series
of
chords
that
he
most
loves
and
the
harmonica
which
softly
greet
his
heart
and
ear
those
that
he
can
not
hear
without
a
little
thrill
running
down
his
spine
are
bad
and
forbidden
when
he
asks
why
no
reply
is
forthcoming
but
that
it
is
so
the
rules
forbid
them
as
he
is
naturally
in
revolt
against
discipline
he
loves
them
only
the
more
his
delight
is
to
find
examples
of
them
in
the
great
and
admired
musicians
and
to
take
them
to
his
grandfather
or
his
master
his
grandfather
replies
that
in
the
great
musicians
they
are
admirable
and
that
beethoven
and
bach
can
take
any
liberty
his
master
less
conciliatory
is
angry
and
says
acidly
that
the
masters
did
better
things
has
a
free
pass
for
the
concerts
and
the
theater
he
has
learned
to
play
every
instrument
a
little
he
is
already
quite
skilful
with
the
violin
and
his
father
procured
him
a
seat
in
the
orchestra
he
acquitted
himself
so
well
there
that
after
a
few
months
probation
he
was
officially
appointed
second
violin
in
the
musik
he
has
begun
to
earn
his
living
not
too
soon
either
for
affairs
at
home
have
gone
from
bad
to
worse
melchior
intemperance
has
swamped
him
and
his
grandfather
is
growing
old
has
taken
in
the
melancholy
situation
he
is
already
as
grave
and
anxious
as
a
man
he
fulfils
his
task
valiantly
though
it
does
not
interest
him
and
he
is
apt
to
fall
asleep
in
the
orchestra
in
the
evenings
because
it
is
late
and
he
is
tired
the
theater
no
longer
rouses
in
him
the
emotion
it
used
to
do
when
he
was
little
when
he
was
little
four
years
ago
his
greatest
ambition
had
been
to
occupy
the
place
that
he
now
holds
but
now
he
dislikes
most
of
the
music
he
is
made
to
play
he
dare
not
yet
pronounce
judgment
upon
it
but
he
does
find
it
foolish
and
if
by
chance
they
do
play
lovely
things
he
is
displeased
by
the
carelessness
with
which
they
are
rendered
and
his
works
are
made
to
appear
like
his
neighbors
and
colleagues
in
the
orchestra
who
as
soon
as
the
curtain
has
fallen
when
they
have
done
with
blowing
and
scraping
mop
their
brows
and
smile
and
chatter
quietly
as
though
they
had
just
finished
an
hour
gymnastics
and
he
has
been
close
to
his
former
flame
the
fair
barefooted
singer
he
meets
her
quite
often
during
the
in
the
saloon
she
knows
that
he
was
once
in
love
with
her
and
she
kisses
him
often
that
gives
him
no
pleasure
he
is
disgusted
by
her
paint
and
scent
and
her
fat
arms
and
her
greediness
he
hates
her
now
the
grand
duke
did
not
forget
his
pianist
in
ordinary
not
that
the
small
pension
which
was
granted
to
him
with
this
title
was
regularly
paid
it
had
to
be
asked
for
but
from
time
to
time
used
to
receive
orders
to
go
to
the
palace
when
there
were
distinguished
guests
or
simply
when
their
highnesses
took
it
into
their
heads
that
they
wanted
to
hear
him
it
was
almost
always
in
the
evening
at
the
time
when
wanted
to
be
alone
he
had
to
leave
everything
and
hurry
off
sometimes
he
was
made
to
wait
in
the
anteroom
because
dinner
was
not
finished
the
servants
accustomed
to
see
him
used
to
address
him
familiarly
then
he
would
be
led
into
a
great
room
full
of
mirrors
and
lights
in
which
men
and
women
used
to
stare
at
him
with
horrid
curiosity
he
had
to
cross
the
waxed
floor
to
kiss
their
highnesses
hands
and
the
more
he
grew
the
more
awkward
he
became
for
he
felt
that
he
was
in
a
ridiculous
position
and
his
pride
used
to
suffer
when
it
was
all
done
he
used
to
sit
at
the
piano
and
have
to
play
for
these
idiots
he
thought
them
idiots
there
were
moments
when
their
indifference
so
oppressed
him
as
he
played
that
he
was
often
on
the
point
of
stopping
in
the
middle
of
a
piece
there
was
no
air
about
him
he
was
near
suffocation
seemed
losing
his
senses
when
he
finished
he
was
overwhelmed
with
congratulations
and
laden
with
compliments
he
was
introduced
all
round
he
thought
they
looked
at
him
like
some
strange
animal
in
the
menagerie
and
that
the
words
of
praise
were
addressed
rather
to
his
master
than
to
himself
he
thought
himself
brought
low
and
he
developed
a
morbid
sensibility
from
which
he
suffered
the
more
as
he
dared
not
show
it
he
saw
offense
in
the
most
simple
actions
if
any
one
laughed
in
a
corner
of
the
room
he
imagined
himself
to
be
the
cause
of
it
and
he
knew
not
whether
it
were
his
manners
or
his
clothes
or
his
person
or
his
hands
or
his
feet
that
caused
the
laughter
he
was
humiliated
by
everything
he
was
humiliated
if
people
did
not
talk
to
him
humiliated
if
they
did
humiliated
if
they
gave
him
sweets
like
a
child
humiliated
especially
when
the
grand
duke
as
sometimes
happened
in
princely
fashion
dismissed
him
by
pressing
a
piece
of
money
into
his
hand
he
was
wretched
at
being
poor
and
at
being
treated
as
a
poor
boy
one
evening
as
he
was
going
home
the
money
that
he
had
received
weighed
so
heavily
upon
him
that
he
threw
it
through
a
cellar
window
and
then
immediately
he
would
have
done
anything
to
get
it
back
for
at
home
there
was
a
month
old
account
with
the
butcher
to
pay
his
relatives
never
suspected
these
injuries
to
his
pride
they
were
delighted
at
his
favor
with
the
prince
poor
louisa
could
conceive
of
nothing
finer
for
her
son
than
these
evenings
at
the
palace
in
splendid
society
as
for
melchior
he
used
to
brag
of
it
continually
to
his
but
grandfather
was
happier
than
any
he
pretended
to
be
independent
and
democratic
and
to
despise
greatness
but
he
had
a
simple
admiration
for
money
power
honors
social
distinction
and
he
took
unbounded
pride
in
seeing
his
grandson
moving
among
those
who
had
these
things
he
delighted
in
them
as
though
such
glory
was
a
reflection
upon
himself
and
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
to
appear
calm
and
indifferent
his
face
used
to
glow
on
the
evenings
when
went
to
the
palace
old
jean
michel
used
always
to
contrive
to
stay
about
the
house
on
some
pretext
or
another
he
used
to
await
his
return
with
childish
impatience
and
when
came
in
he
would
begin
at
once
with
a
careless
air
to
ply
him
with
seeming
idle
questions
such
as
well
did
things
go
well
or
he
would
make
little
hints
like
here
our
he
can
tell
us
some
news
or
he
would
produce
some
ingenious
compliment
by
way
of
flattery
here
our
young
nobleman
but
out
of
sorts
and
out
of
temper
would
reply
with
a
curt
and
go
and
sulk
in
a
corner
but
the
old
man
would
persist
and
ply
him
with
more
direct
questions
to
which
the
boy
replied
only
yes
or
no
then
the
others
would
join
in
and
ask
for
details
would
look
more
and
more
thunderous
they
had
to
drag
the
words
from
his
lips
until
jean
michel
would
lose
his
temper
and
hurl
insults
at
him
then
would
reply
with
scant
respect
and
the
end
would
be
a
rumpus
the
old
man
would
go
out
and
slam
the
door
so
spoiled
the
joy
of
these
poor
people
who
had
no
inkling
of
the
cause
of
his
bad
temper
it
was
not
their
fault
if
they
had
the
souls
of
servants
and
never
dreamed
that
it
is
possible
to
be
otherwise
was
turned
into
himself
and
though
he
never
judged
his
family
yet
he
felt
a
gulf
between
himself
and
them
no
doubt
he
exaggerated
what
lay
between
them
and
in
spite
of
their
different
ways
of
thought
it
is
quite
probable
that
they
could
have
understood
each
other
if
he
had
been
able
to
talk
intimately
to
them
but
it
is
known
that
nothing
is
more
difficult
than
absolute
intimacy
between
children
and
parents
even
when
there
is
much
love
between
them
for
on
the
one
side
respect
discourages
confidence
and
on
the
other
the
idea
often
erroneous
of
the
superiority
of
age
and
experience
prevents
them
taking
seriously
enough
the
child
feelings
which
are
often
just
as
interesting
as
those
of
persons
and
almost
always
more
sincere
but
the
people
that
saw
at
home
and
the
conversation
that
he
heard
there
widened
the
distance
between
himself
and
his
family
melchior
friends
used
to
frequent
the
house
mostly
musicians
of
the
orchestra
single
men
and
hard
drinkers
they
were
not
bad
fellows
but
vulgar
they
made
the
house
shake
with
their
footsteps
and
their
laughter
they
loved
music
but
they
spoke
of
it
with
a
stupidity
that
was
revolting
the
coarse
indiscretion
of
their
enthusiasm
wounded
the
boy
modesty
of
feeling
when
they
praised
a
work
that
he
loved
it
was
as
though
they
were
insulting
him
personally
he
would
stiffen
himself
and
grow
pale
frozen
and
pretend
not
to
take
any
interest
in
music
he
would
have
hated
it
had
that
been
possible
melchior
used
to
say
the
fellow
has
no
heart
he
feels
nothing
i
do
know
where
he
gets
it
from
sometimes
they
used
to
sing
german
songs
as
well
and
these
were
all
exactly
like
themselves
solemn
and
broad
fashioned
of
dull
melodies
then
used
to
fly
to
the
most
distant
room
and
hurl
insults
at
the
wall
his
grandfather
also
had
friends
the
organist
the
the
the
garrulous
old
men
who
used
always
to
pass
round
the
same
jokes
and
plunge
into
interminable
discussions
on
art
politics
or
the
family
trees
of
the
countryside
much
less
interested
in
the
subjects
of
which
they
talked
than
happy
to
talk
and
to
find
an
audience
as
for
louisa
she
used
only
to
see
some
of
her
neighbors
who
brought
her
the
gossip
of
the
place
and
at
rare
intervals
a
kind
lady
who
under
pretext
of
taking
an
interest
in
her
used
to
come
and
engage
her
services
for
a
and
pretend
to
watch
over
the
religious
education
of
the
children
but
of
all
who
came
to
the
house
none
was
more
repugnant
to
than
his
uncle
theodore
a
stepson
of
his
grandfather
a
son
by
a
former
marriage
of
his
grandmother
clara
jean
michel
first
wife
he
was
a
partner
in
a
great
commercial
house
which
did
business
in
africa
and
the
far
east
he
was
the
exact
type
of
one
of
those
germans
of
the
new
style
whose
affectation
it
is
scoffingly
to
repudiate
the
old
idealism
of
the
race
and
intoxicated
by
conquest
to
maintain
a
cult
of
strength
and
success
which
shows
that
they
are
not
accustomed
to
seeing
them
on
their
side
but
as
it
is
difficult
at
once
to
change
the
nature
of
a
people
the
despised
idealism
sprang
up
again
in
him
at
every
turn
in
language
manners
and
moral
habits
and
the
quotations
from
goethe
to
fit
the
smallest
incidents
of
domestic
life
for
he
was
a
singular
compound
of
conscience
and
there
was
in
him
a
curious
effort
to
reconcile
the
honest
principles
of
the
old
german
with
the
cynicism
of
these
new
commercial
a
compound
which
forever
gave
out
a
repulsive
flavor
of
hypocrisy
forever
striving
to
make
of
german
strength
avarice
and
the
symbols
of
all
right
justice
and
truth
loyalty
was
deeply
injured
by
all
this
he
could
not
tell
whether
his
uncle
were
right
or
no
but
he
hated
him
and
marked
him
down
for
an
enemy
his
grandfather
had
no
great
love
for
him
either
and
was
in
revolt
against
his
theories
but
he
was
easily
crushed
in
argument
by
theodore
fluency
which
was
never
hard
put
to
it
to
turn
into
ridicule
the
old
man
simple
generosity
in
the
end
jean
michel
came
to
be
ashamed
of
his
own
and
by
way
of
showing
that
he
was
not
so
much
behind
the
times
as
they
thought
he
used
to
try
to
talk
like
theodore
but
the
words
came
hollow
from
his
lips
and
he
was
ill
at
ease
with
them
whatever
he
may
have
thought
of
him
theodore
did
impress
him
he
felt
respect
for
such
practical
skill
which
he
admired
the
more
for
knowing
himself
to
be
absolutely
incapable
of
it
he
used
to
dream
of
putting
one
of
his
grandsons
to
similar
work
that
was
melchior
idea
also
he
intended
to
make
rodolphe
follow
in
his
uncle
footsteps
and
so
the
whole
family
set
itself
to
flatter
this
rich
relation
of
whom
they
expected
help
he
seeing
that
he
was
necessary
to
them
took
advantage
of
it
to
cut
a
fine
masterful
figure
he
meddled
in
everything
gave
advice
upon
everything
and
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
his
contempt
for
art
and
artists
rather
he
blazoned
it
abroad
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
humiliating
his
musicianly
relations
and
he
used
to
indulge
in
stupid
jokes
at
their
expense
and
the
cowards
used
to
laugh
especially
was
singled
out
as
a
butt
for
his
jests
he
was
not
patient
under
them
he
would
say
nothing
but
he
used
to
grind
his
teeth
angrily
and
his
uncle
used
to
laugh
at
his
speechless
rage
but
one
day
when
theodore
went
too
far
in
his
teasing
losing
control
of
himself
spat
in
his
face
it
was
a
fearful
affair
the
insult
was
so
monstrous
that
his
uncle
was
at
first
paralyzed
by
it
then
words
came
back
to
him
and
he
broke
out
into
a
flood
of
abuse
sat
petrified
by
the
enormity
of
the
thing
that
he
had
done
and
did
not
even
feel
the
blows
that
rained
down
upon
him
but
when
they
tried
to
force
him
down
on
his
knees
before
his
uncle
he
broke
away
jostled
his
mother
aside
and
ran
out
of
the
house
he
did
not
stop
until
he
could
breathe
no
more
and
then
he
was
right
out
in
the
country
he
heard
voices
calling
him
and
he
debated
within
himself
whether
he
had
not
better
throw
himself
into
the
river
since
he
could
not
do
so
with
his
enemy
he
spent
the
night
in
the
fields
at
dawn
he
went
and
knocked
at
his
grandfather
door
the
old
man
had
been
so
upset
by
disappearance
he
had
not
slept
for
it
that
he
had
not
the
heart
to
scold
him
he
took
him
home
and
then
nothing
was
said
to
him
because
it
was
apparent
that
he
was
still
in
an
excited
condition
and
they
had
to
smooth
him
down
for
he
had
to
play
at
the
palace
that
evening
but
for
several
weeks
melchior
continued
to
overwhelm
him
with
his
complaints
addressed
to
nobody
in
particular
about
the
trouble
that
a
man
takes
to
give
an
example
of
an
irreproachable
life
and
good
manners
to
unworthy
creatures
who
dishonor
him
and
when
his
uncle
theodore
met
him
in
the
street
he
turned
his
head
and
held
his
nose
by
way
of
showing
his
extreme
disgust
finding
so
little
sympathy
at
home
spent
as
little
time
there
as
possible
he
chafed
against
the
continual
restraint
which
they
strove
to
set
upon
him
there
were
too
many
things
too
many
people
that
he
had
to
respect
and
he
was
never
allowed
to
ask
why
and
did
not
possess
the
bump
of
respect
the
more
they
tried
to
discipline
him
and
to
turn
him
into
an
honest
little
german
the
more
he
felt
the
need
of
breaking
free
from
it
all
it
would
have
been
his
pleasure
after
the
dull
tedious
formal
performances
which
he
had
to
attend
in
the
orchestra
or
at
the
palace
to
roll
in
the
grass
like
a
fowl
and
to
slide
down
the
grassy
slope
on
the
seat
of
his
new
trousers
or
to
have
a
with
the
urchins
of
the
neighborhood
it
was
not
because
he
was
afraid
of
scoldings
and
thwackings
that
he
did
not
do
these
things
more
often
but
because
he
had
no
playmates
he
could
not
get
on
with
other
children
even
the
little
guttersnipes
did
not
like
playing
with
him
because
he
took
every
game
too
seriously
and
struck
too
lustily
he
had
grown
used
to
being
driven
in
on
himself
and
to
living
apart
from
children
of
his
own
age
he
was
ashamed
of
not
being
clever
at
games
and
dared
not
take
part
in
their
sport
and
he
used
to
pretend
to
take
no
interest
in
it
although
he
was
consumed
by
the
desire
to
be
asked
to
play
with
them
but
they
never
said
anything
to
him
and
then
he
would
go
away
hurt
but
assuming
indifference
he
found
consolation
in
wandering
with
uncle
gottfried
when
he
was
in
the
neighborhood
he
became
more
and
more
friendly
with
him
and
sympathized
with
his
independent
temper
he
understood
so
well
now
gottfried
delight
in
tramping
the
roads
without
a
tie
in
the
world
often
they
used
to
go
out
together
in
the
evening
into
the
country
straight
on
aimlessly
and
as
gottfried
always
forgot
the
time
they
used
to
come
back
very
late
and
then
were
scolded
gottfried
knew
that
it
was
wrong
but
used
to
implore
and
he
could
not
himself
resist
the
pleasure
of
it
about
midnight
he
would
stand
in
front
of
the
house
and
whistle
an
agreed
signal
would
be
in
his
bed
fully
dressed
he
would
slip
out
with
his
shoes
in
his
hand
and
holding
his
breath
creep
with
all
the
artful
skill
of
a
savage
to
the
kitchen
window
which
opened
on
to
the
road
he
would
climb
on
to
the
table
gottfried
would
take
him
on
his
shoulders
and
then
off
they
would
go
happy
as
truants
sometimes
they
would
go
and
seek
out
jeremy
the
fisherman
a
friend
of
gottfried
and
then
they
would
slip
out
in
his
boat
under
the
moon
the
water
dropping
from
the
oars
gave
out
little
arpeggios
then
chromatic
scales
a
milky
vapor
hung
tremulous
over
the
surface
of
the
waters
the
stars
quivered
the
cocks
called
to
each
other
from
either
bank
and
sometimes
in
the
depths
of
the
sky
they
heard
the
trilling
of
larks
ascending
from
earth
deceived
by
the
light
of
the
moon
they
were
silent
gottfried
hummed
a
tune
jeremy
told
strange
tales
of
the
lives
of
the
beasts
tales
that
gained
in
mystery
from
the
curt
and
enigmatic
manner
of
their
telling
the
moon
hid
herself
behind
the
woods
they
skirted
the
black
mass
of
the
hills
the
darkness
of
the
water
and
the
sky
mingled
there
was
never
a
ripple
on
the
water
sounds
died
down
the
boat
glided
through
the
night
was
she
gliding
was
she
moving
was
she
still
the
reeds
parted
with
a
sound
like
the
rustling
of
silk
the
boat
grounded
noiselessly
they
climbed
out
on
to
the
bank
and
returned
on
foot
they
would
not
return
until
dawn
they
followed
the
clouds
of
silver
ablets
green
as
ears
of
corn
or
blue
as
jewels
teemed
in
the
first
light
of
day
they
swarmed
like
the
serpents
of
medusa
head
and
flung
themselves
greedily
at
the
bread
thrown
to
them
they
plunged
for
it
as
it
sank
and
turned
in
spirals
and
then
darted
away
in
a
flash
like
a
ray
of
light
the
river
took
on
rosy
and
purple
hues
of
reflection
the
birds
woke
one
after
another
the
truants
hurried
back
just
as
carefully
as
when
they
had
set
out
they
returned
to
the
room
with
its
thick
atmosphere
and
worn
out
fell
into
bed
and
slept
at
once
with
his
body
with
the
smell
of
the
fields
all
was
well
and
nothing
would
have
been
known
but
that
one
day
ernest
his
younger
brother
betrayed
midnight
sallies
from
that
moment
they
were
forbidden
and
he
was
watched
but
he
contrived
to
escape
and
he
preferred
the
society
of
the
little
peddler
and
his
friends
to
any
other
his
family
was
scandalized
melchior
said
that
he
had
the
tastes
of
a
laborer
old
jean
michel
was
jealous
of
affection
for
gottfried
and
used
to
lecture
him
about
lowering
himself
so
far
as
to
like
such
vulgar
company
when
he
had
the
honor
of
mixing
with
the
best
people
and
of
being
the
servant
of
princes
it
was
considered
that
was
lacking
in
dignity
and
in
spite
of
the
penury
which
increased
with
melchior
intemperance
and
folly
life
was
tolerable
as
long
as
jean
michel
was
there
he
was
the
only
creature
who
had
any
influence
over
melchior
and
who
could
hold
him
back
to
a
certain
extent
from
his
vice
the
esteem
in
which
he
was
generally
held
did
serve
to
pass
over
the
drunkard
freaks
and
he
used
constantly
to
come
to
the
aid
of
the
household
with
money
besides
the
modest
pension
which
he
enjoyed
as
retired
he
was
still
able
to
earn
small
sums
by
giving
lessons
and
tuning
pianos
he
gave
most
of
it
to
his
for
he
perceived
her
difficulties
though
she
strove
to
hide
them
from
him
louisa
hated
the
idea
that
he
was
denying
himself
for
them
and
it
was
all
the
more
to
the
old
man
credit
in
that
he
had
always
been
accustomed
to
a
large
way
of
living
and
had
great
needs
to
satisfy
sometimes
even
his
ordinary
sacrifices
were
not
sufficient
and
to
meet
some
urgent
debt
jean
michel
would
have
secretly
to
sell
a
piece
of
furniture
or
books
or
some
relic
that
he
set
store
by
melchior
knew
that
his
father
made
presents
to
louisa
that
were
concealed
from
himself
and
very
often
he
would
lay
hands
on
them
in
spite
of
protest
but
when
this
came
to
the
old
man
ears
not
from
louisa
who
said
nothing
of
her
troubles
to
him
but
from
one
of
his
grandchildren
he
would
fly
into
a
terrible
passion
and
there
were
frightful
scenes
between
the
two
men
they
were
both
extraordinarily
violent
and
they
would
come
to
round
oaths
and
threats
almost
it
seemed
as
though
they
would
come
to
blows
but
even
in
his
most
angry
passion
respect
would
hold
melchior
in
check
and
however
drunk
he
might
be
in
the
end
he
would
bow
his
head
to
the
torrent
of
insults
and
humiliating
reproach
which
his
father
poured
out
upon
him
but
for
that
he
did
not
cease
to
watch
for
the
first
opportunity
of
breaking
out
again
and
with
his
thoughts
on
the
future
jean
michel
would
be
filled
with
melancholy
and
anxious
fears
my
poor
children
he
used
to
say
to
louisa
what
will
become
of
you
when
i
am
no
longer
here
fortunately
he
would
add
fondling
i
can
go
on
until
this
fellow
pulls
you
out
of
the
mire
but
he
was
out
in
his
reckoning
he
was
at
the
end
of
his
road
no
one
would
have
suspected
it
he
was
surprisingly
strong
he
was
past
eighty
he
had
a
full
head
of
hair
a
white
mane
still
gray
in
patches
and
in
his
thick
beard
were
still
black
hairs
he
had
only
about
ten
teeth
left
but
with
these
he
could
chew
lustily
it
was
a
pleasure
to
see
him
at
table
he
had
a
hearty
appetite
and
though
he
reproached
melchior
for
drinking
he
always
emptied
his
bottle
himself
he
had
a
preference
for
white
moselle
for
the
rest
wine
beer
cider
he
could
do
justice
to
all
the
good
things
that
the
lord
hath
made
he
was
not
so
foolish
as
to
lose
his
reason
in
his
cups
and
he
kept
to
his
allowance
it
is
true
that
it
was
a
plentiful
allowance
and
that
a
feebler
intelligence
must
have
been
made
drunk
by
it
he
was
strong
of
foot
and
eye
and
indefatigably
active
he
got
up
at
six
and
performed
his
ablutions
scrupulously
for
he
cared
for
his
appearance
and
respected
his
person
he
lived
alone
in
his
house
of
which
he
was
sole
occupant
and
never
let
his
meddle
with
his
affairs
he
cleaned
out
his
room
made
his
own
coffee
sewed
on
his
buttons
nailed
and
glued
and
altered
and
going
to
and
fro
and
up
and
down
stairs
in
his
he
never
stopped
singing
in
a
sounding
bass
which
he
loved
to
let
ring
out
as
he
accompanied
himself
with
operatic
gestures
and
then
he
used
to
go
out
in
all
weathers
he
went
about
his
business
omitting
none
but
he
was
not
often
punctual
he
was
to
be
seen
at
every
street
corner
arguing
with
some
acquaintance
or
joking
with
some
woman
whose
face
he
had
remembered
for
he
loved
pretty
women
and
old
friends
and
so
he
was
always
late
and
never
knew
the
time
but
he
never
let
the
slip
by
he
dined
wherever
he
might
be
inviting
himself
and
he
would
not
go
home
until
late
after
nightfall
after
a
visit
to
his
grandchildren
then
he
would
go
to
bed
and
before
he
went
to
sleep
read
a
page
of
his
old
bible
and
during
the
night
for
he
never
slept
for
more
than
an
hour
or
two
together
he
would
get
up
to
take
down
one
of
his
old
books
bought
history
theology
or
science
he
used
to
read
at
random
a
few
pages
which
interested
and
bored
him
and
he
did
not
rightly
understand
them
though
he
did
not
skip
a
word
until
sleep
came
to
him
again
on
sunday
he
would
go
to
church
walk
with
the
children
and
play
bowls
he
had
never
been
ill
except
for
a
little
gout
in
his
toes
which
used
to
make
him
swear
at
night
while
he
was
reading
his
bible
it
seemed
as
though
he
might
live
to
be
a
hundred
and
he
himself
could
see
no
reason
why
he
should
not
live
longer
when
people
said
that
he
would
die
a
centenarian
he
used
to
think
like
another
illustrious
old
man
that
no
limit
can
be
appointed
to
the
goodness
of
providence
the
only
sign
that
he
was
growing
old
was
that
he
was
more
easily
brought
to
tears
and
was
becoming
every
day
more
irritable
the
smallest
impatience
with
him
could
throw
him
into
a
violent
fury
his
red
face
and
short
neck
would
grow
redder
than
ever
he
would
stutter
angrily
and
have
to
stop
choking
the
family
doctor
an
old
friend
had
warned
him
to
take
care
and
to
moderate
both
his
anger
and
his
appetite
but
with
an
old
man
obstinacy
he
plunged
into
acts
of
still
greater
recklessness
out
of
bravado
and
he
laughed
at
medicine
and
doctors
he
pretended
to
despise
death
and
did
not
mince
his
language
when
he
declared
that
he
was
not
afraid
of
it
one
summer
day
when
it
was
very
hot
and
he
had
drunk
copiously
and
argued
in
the
he
went
home
and
began
to
work
quietly
in
his
garden
he
loved
digging
bareheaded
under
the
sun
still
irritated
by
his
argument
he
dug
angrily
was
sitting
in
the
arbor
with
a
book
in
his
hand
but
he
was
not
reading
he
was
dreaming
and
listening
to
the
cheeping
of
the
crickets
and
mechanically
following
his
movements
the
old
man
back
was
towards
him
he
was
bending
and
plucking
out
weeds
suddenly
saw
him
rise
beat
against
the
air
with
his
arms
and
fall
heavily
with
his
face
to
the
ground
for
a
moment
he
wanted
to
laugh
then
he
saw
that
the
old
man
did
not
stir
he
called
to
him
ran
to
him
and
shook
him
with
all
his
strength
fear
seized
him
he
knelt
and
with
his
two
hands
tried
to
raise
the
great
head
from
the
ground
it
was
so
heavy
and
he
trembled
so
that
he
could
hardly
move
it
but
when
he
saw
the
eyes
turned
up
white
and
bloody
he
was
frozen
with
horror
and
with
a
shrill
cry
let
the
head
fall
he
got
up
in
terror
ran
away
and
out
of
the
place
he
cried
and
wept
a
man
passing
by
stopped
the
boy
could
not
speak
but
he
pointed
to
the
house
the
man
went
in
and
followed
him
others
had
heard
his
cries
and
they
came
from
the
neighboring
houses
soon
the
garden
was
full
of
people
they
trampled
the
flowers
and
bent
down
over
the
old
man
they
cried
aloud
two
or
three
men
lifted
him
up
stayed
by
the
gate
turned
to
the
wall
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
he
was
afraid
to
look
but
he
could
not
help
himself
and
when
they
passed
him
he
saw
through
his
fingers
the
old
man
huge
body
limp
and
flabby
one
arm
dragged
along
the
ground
the
head
leaning
against
the
knee
of
one
of
the
men
carrying
the
body
bobbed
at
every
step
and
the
face
was
scarred
covered
with
mud
bleeding
the
mouth
was
open
and
the
eyes
were
fearful
he
howled
again
and
took
to
flight
he
ran
as
though
something
were
after
him
and
never
stopped
until
he
reached
home
he
burst
into
the
kitchen
with
frightful
cries
louisa
was
cleaning
vegetables
he
hurled
himself
at
her
and
hugged
her
desperately
imploring
her
help
his
face
was
distorted
with
his
sobs
he
could
hardly
speak
but
at
the
first
word
she
understood
she
went
white
let
the
things
fall
from
her
hands
and
without
a
word
rushed
from
the
house
was
left
alone
crouching
against
a
cupboard
he
went
on
weeping
his
brothers
were
playing
he
could
not
make
out
quite
what
had
happened
he
did
not
think
of
his
grandfather
he
was
thinking
only
of
the
dreadful
sights
he
had
just
seen
and
he
was
in
terror
lest
he
should
be
made
to
return
to
see
them
again
and
as
it
turned
out
in
the
evening
when
the
other
children
tired
of
doing
every
sort
of
mischief
in
the
house
were
beginning
to
feel
wearied
and
hungry
louisa
rushed
in
again
took
them
by
the
hand
and
led
them
to
their
grandfather
house
she
walked
very
fast
and
ernest
and
rodolphe
tried
to
complain
as
usual
but
louisa
bade
them
be
silent
in
such
a
tone
of
voice
that
they
held
their
peace
an
instinctive
fear
seized
them
and
when
they
entered
the
house
they
began
to
weep
it
was
not
yet
night
the
last
hours
of
the
sunset
cast
strange
lights
over
the
inside
of
the
house
on
the
on
the
mirror
on
the
violin
hung
on
the
wall
in
the
chief
room
which
was
half
in
darkness
but
in
the
old
man
room
a
candle
was
alight
and
the
flickering
flame
vying
with
the
livid
dying
day
made
the
heavy
darkness
of
the
room
more
oppressive
melchior
was
sitting
near
the
window
loudly
weeping
the
doctor
leaning
over
the
bed
hid
from
sight
what
was
lying
there
heart
beat
so
that
it
was
like
to
break
louisa
made
the
children
kneel
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
stole
a
glance
he
expected
something
so
terrifying
after
what
he
had
seen
in
the
afternoon
that
at
the
first
glimpse
he
was
almost
comforted
his
grandfather
lay
motionless
and
seemed
to
be
asleep
for
a
moment
the
child
believed
that
the
old
man
was
better
and
that
all
was
at
an
end
but
when
he
heard
his
heavy
breathing
when
as
he
looked
closer
he
saw
the
swollen
face
on
which
the
wound
that
he
had
come
by
in
the
fall
had
made
a
broad
scar
when
he
understood
that
here
was
a
man
at
point
of
death
he
began
to
tremble
and
while
he
repeated
louisa
prayer
for
the
restoration
of
his
grandfather
in
his
heart
he
prayed
that
if
the
old
man
could
not
get
well
he
might
be
already
dead
he
was
terrified
at
the
prospect
of
what
was
going
to
happen
the
old
man
had
not
been
conscious
since
the
moment
of
his
fall
he
only
returned
to
consciousness
for
a
moment
enough
to
learn
his
condition
and
that
was
lamentable
the
priest
was
there
and
recited
the
last
prayers
over
him
they
raised
the
old
man
on
his
pillow
he
opened
his
eyes
slowly
and
they
seemed
no
longer
to
obey
his
will
he
breathed
noisily
and
with
unseeing
eyes
looked
at
the
faces
and
the
lights
and
suddenly
he
opened
his
mouth
a
nameless
terror
showed
on
his
features
but
then
he
gasped
but
i
am
going
to
die
the
awful
sound
of
his
voice
pierced
heart
never
never
was
it
to
fade
from
his
memory
the
old
man
said
no
more
he
moaned
like
a
little
child
the
stupor
took
him
once
more
but
his
breathing
became
more
and
more
difficult
he
groaned
he
fidgeted
with
his
hands
he
seemed
to
struggle
against
the
mortal
sleep
in
his
he
cried
once
mother
oh
the
biting
impression
that
it
made
this
mumbling
of
the
old
man
calling
in
anguish
on
his
mother
as
would
himself
have
done
his
mother
of
whom
he
was
never
known
to
talk
in
life
to
whom
he
now
turned
instinctively
the
last
futile
refuge
in
the
last
terror
then
he
seemed
to
be
comforted
for
a
moment
he
had
once
more
a
flicker
of
consciousness
his
heavy
eyes
the
pupils
of
which
seemed
to
move
aimlessly
met
those
of
the
boy
frozen
in
his
fear
they
lit
up
the
old
man
tried
to
smile
and
speak
louisa
took
and
led
him
to
the
bedside
jean
michel
moved
his
lips
and
tried
to
caress
his
head
with
his
hand
but
then
he
fell
back
into
his
torpor
it
was
the
end
they
sent
the
children
into
the
next
room
but
they
had
too
much
to
do
to
worry
about
them
and
under
the
attraction
of
the
horror
of
it
peeped
through
the
door
at
the
tragic
face
on
the
pillow
the
man
strangled
by
the
firm
clutch
that
had
him
by
the
neck
the
face
which
grew
ever
more
hollow
as
he
watched
the
sinking
of
the
creature
into
the
void
which
seemed
to
suck
it
down
like
a
pump
and
the
horrible
the
mechanical
breathing
like
a
bubble
of
air
bursting
on
the
surface
of
waters
the
last
efforts
of
the
body
which
strives
to
live
when
the
soul
is
no
longer
then
the
head
fell
on
one
side
on
the
pillow
all
all
was
silence
a
few
moments
later
in
the
midst
of
the
sobs
and
prayers
and
the
confusion
caused
by
the
death
louisa
saw
the
child
pale
with
gaping
mouth
clutching
convulsively
at
the
handle
of
the
door
she
ran
to
him
he
had
a
seizure
in
her
arms
she
carried
him
away
he
lost
consciousness
he
woke
up
to
find
himself
in
his
bed
he
howled
in
terror
because
he
had
been
left
alone
for
a
moment
had
another
seizure
and
fainted
again
for
the
rest
of
the
night
and
the
next
day
he
was
in
a
fever
finally
he
grew
calm
and
on
the
next
night
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
which
lasted
until
the
middle
of
the
following
day
he
felt
that
some
one
was
walking
in
his
room
that
his
mother
was
leaning
over
his
bed
and
kissing
him
he
thought
he
heard
the
sweet
distant
sound
of
bells
but
he
would
not
stir
he
was
in
a
dream
when
he
opened
his
eyes
again
his
uncle
gottfried
was
sitting
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
was
worn
out
and
could
remember
nothing
then
his
memory
returned
and
he
began
to
weep
gottfried
got
up
and
kissed
him
well
my
boy
well
he
said
gently
oh
uncle
uncle
sobbed
the
boy
clinging
to
him
cry
then
said
gottfried
cry
he
also
was
weeping
when
he
was
a
little
comforted
dried
his
eyes
and
looked
at
gottfried
gottfried
understood
that
he
wanted
to
ask
something
no
he
said
putting
a
finger
to
his
lips
you
must
not
talk
it
is
good
to
cry
bad
to
talk
the
boy
insisted
it
is
no
good
only
one
thing
only
one
what
hesitated
oh
uncle
he
asked
where
is
he
now
gottfried
answered
he
is
with
the
lord
my
boy
but
that
was
not
what
had
asked
no
you
do
not
understand
where
is
he
he
he
meant
the
body
he
went
on
in
a
trembling
voice
is
still
in
the
house
they
buried
the
good
man
this
morning
said
gottfried
did
you
not
hear
the
bells
was
comforted
then
when
he
thought
that
he
would
never
see
his
beloved
grandfather
again
he
wept
once
more
bitterly
poor
little
beast
said
gottfried
looking
pityingly
at
the
child
expected
gottfried
to
console
him
but
gottfried
made
no
attempt
to
do
so
knowing
that
it
was
useless
uncle
gottfried
asked
the
boy
are
not
you
afraid
of
it
too
much
did
he
wish
that
gottfried
should
not
have
been
afraid
and
would
tell
him
the
secret
of
it
he
said
in
a
troubled
voice
and
how
is
one
not
to
be
afraid
he
said
after
a
moment
but
what
can
one
do
it
is
so
one
must
put
up
with
it
shook
his
head
in
protest
one
has
to
put
up
with
it
my
boy
said
gottfried
ordered
it
up
yonder
one
has
to
love
what
has
ordered
i
hate
him
said
angrily
shaking
his
fist
at
the
sky
gottfried
fearfully
bade
him
be
silent
himself
was
afraid
of
what
he
had
just
said
and
he
began
to
pray
with
gottfried
but
blood
boiled
and
as
he
repeated
the
words
of
servile
humility
and
resignation
there
was
in
his
inmost
heart
a
feeling
of
passionate
revolt
and
horror
of
the
abominable
thing
and
the
monstrous
being
who
had
been
able
to
create
it
days
passed
and
nights
of
rain
over
the
earth
under
which
lay
the
remains
of
poor
old
jean
michel
at
the
moment
melchior
wept
and
cried
and
sobbed
much
but
the
week
was
not
out
before
heard
him
laughing
heartily
when
the
name
of
the
dead
man
was
pronounced
in
his
presence
his
face
grew
longer
and
a
lugubrious
expression
came
into
it
but
in
a
moment
he
would
begin
to
talk
and
gesticulate
excitedly
he
was
sincerely
afflicted
but
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
remain
sad
for
long
louisa
passive
and
resigned
accepted
the
misfortune
as
she
accepted
everything
she
added
a
prayer
to
her
daily
prayers
she
went
regularly
to
the
cemetery
and
cared
for
the
grass
as
if
it
were
part
of
her
household
gottfried
paid
touching
attention
to
the
little
patch
of
ground
where
the
old
man
slept
when
he
came
to
the
neighborhood
he
brought
a
little
souvenir
a
cross
that
he
had
made
or
flowers
that
jean
michel
had
loved
he
never
missed
even
if
he
were
only
in
the
town
for
a
few
hours
and
he
did
it
by
stealth
sometimes
louisa
took
with
her
on
her
visits
to
the
cemetery
revolted
in
disgust
against
the
fat
patch
of
earth
clad
in
its
sinister
adornment
of
flowers
and
trees
and
against
the
heavy
scent
which
mounts
to
the
sun
mingling
with
the
breath
of
the
sonorous
cypress
but
he
dared
not
confess
his
disgust
because
he
condemned
it
in
himself
as
cowardly
and
impious
he
was
very
unhappy
his
grandfather
death
haunted
him
incessantly
and
yet
he
had
long
known
what
death
was
and
had
thought
about
it
and
been
afraid
of
it
but
he
had
never
before
seen
it
and
he
who
sees
it
for
the
first
time
learns
that
he
knew
nothing
neither
of
death
nor
of
life
one
moment
brings
everything
tottering
reason
is
of
no
avail
you
thought
you
were
alive
you
thought
you
had
some
experience
of
life
you
see
then
that
you
knew
nothing
that
you
have
been
living
in
a
veil
of
illusions
spun
by
your
own
mind
to
hide
from
your
eyes
the
awful
countenance
of
reality
there
is
no
connection
between
the
idea
of
suffering
and
the
creature
who
bleeds
and
suffers
there
is
no
connection
between
the
idea
of
death
and
the
convulsions
of
body
and
soul
in
combat
and
in
death
human
language
human
wisdom
are
only
a
of
stiff
mechanical
dolls
by
the
side
of
the
grim
charm
of
reality
and
the
creatures
of
mind
and
blood
whose
desperate
and
vain
efforts
are
strained
to
the
fixing
of
a
life
which
crumbles
away
with
every
day
thought
of
death
day
and
night
memories
of
the
last
agony
pursued
him
he
heard
that
horrible
breathing
every
night
whatever
he
might
be
doing
he
saw
his
grandfather
again
all
nature
was
changed
it
seemed
as
though
there
were
an
icy
vapor
drawn
over
her
round
him
everywhere
whichever
way
he
turned
he
felt
upon
his
face
the
fatal
breathing
of
the
blind
beast
he
felt
himself
in
the
grip
of
that
fearful
destructive
form
and
he
felt
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
far
from
crushing
him
the
thought
of
it
set
him
aflame
with
hate
and
indignation
he
was
never
resigned
to
it
he
butted
head
down
against
the
impossible
it
mattered
nothing
that
he
broke
his
head
and
was
forced
to
realize
that
he
was
not
the
stronger
he
never
ceased
to
revolt
against
suffering
from
that
time
on
his
life
was
an
unceasing
struggle
against
the
savagery
of
a
fate
which
he
could
not
admit
the
very
misery
of
his
life
afforded
him
relief
from
the
obsession
of
his
thoughts
the
ruin
of
his
family
which
only
jean
michel
had
withheld
proceeded
apace
when
he
was
removed
with
him
the
kraffts
had
lost
their
chief
means
of
support
and
misery
entered
the
house
melchior
increased
it
far
from
working
more
he
abandoned
himself
utterly
to
his
vice
when
he
was
free
of
the
only
force
that
had
held
him
in
check
almost
every
night
he
returned
home
drunk
and
he
never
brought
back
his
earnings
besides
he
had
lost
almost
all
his
lessons
one
day
he
had
appeared
at
the
house
of
one
of
his
pupils
in
a
state
of
complete
intoxication
and
as
a
consequence
of
this
scandal
all
doors
were
closed
to
him
he
was
only
tolerated
in
the
orchestra
out
of
regard
for
the
memory
of
his
father
but
louisa
trembled
lest
he
should
he
dismissed
any
day
after
a
scene
he
had
already
been
threatened
with
it
on
several
evenings
when
he
had
turned
up
in
his
place
about
the
end
of
the
performance
twice
or
thrice
he
had
forgotten
altogether
to
put
in
an
appearance
and
of
what
was
he
not
capable
in
those
moments
of
stupid
excitement
when
he
was
taken
with
the
itch
to
do
and
say
idiotic
things
had
he
not
taken
it
into
his
head
one
evening
to
try
and
play
his
great
violin
concerto
in
the
middle
of
an
act
of
the
they
were
hard
put
to
it
to
stop
him
sometimes
too
he
would
shout
with
laughter
in
the
middle
of
a
performance
at
the
amusing
pictures
that
were
presented
on
the
stage
or
whirling
in
his
own
brain
he
was
a
joy
to
his
colleagues
and
they
passed
over
many
things
because
he
was
so
funny
but
such
indulgence
was
worse
than
severity
and
could
have
died
for
shame
the
boy
was
now
first
violin
in
the
orchestra
he
sat
so
that
he
could
watch
over
his
father
and
when
necessary
beseech
him
and
make
him
be
silent
it
was
not
easy
and
the
best
thing
was
not
to
pay
any
attention
to
him
for
if
he
did
as
soon
as
the
sot
felt
that
eyes
were
upon
him
he
would
take
to
making
faces
or
launch
out
into
a
speech
then
would
turn
away
trembling
with
fear
lest
he
should
commit
some
outrageous
prank
he
would
try
to
be
absorbed
in
his
work
but
he
could
not
help
hearing
melchior
utterances
and
the
laughter
of
his
colleagues
tears
would
come
into
his
eyes
the
musicians
good
fellows
that
they
were
had
seen
that
and
were
sorry
for
him
they
would
hush
their
laughter
and
only
talk
about
his
father
when
was
not
by
but
was
conscious
of
their
pity
he
knew
that
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
their
jokes
would
break
out
again
and
that
melchior
was
the
of
the
town
he
could
not
stop
him
and
he
was
in
torment
he
used
to
bring
his
father
home
after
the
play
he
would
take
his
arm
put
up
with
his
pleasantries
and
try
to
conceal
the
stumbling
in
his
walk
but
he
deceived
no
one
and
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
it
was
very
rarely
that
he
could
succeed
in
leading
melchior
all
the
way
home
at
the
corner
of
the
street
melchior
would
declare
that
he
had
an
urgent
appointment
with
some
friends
and
no
argument
could
dissuade
him
from
keeping
this
engagement
took
care
not
to
insist
too
much
so
as
not
to
expose
himself
to
a
scene
and
paternal
imprecations
which
might
attract
the
neighbors
to
their
windows
all
the
household
money
slipped
away
in
this
fashion
melchior
was
not
satisfied
with
drinking
away
his
earnings
he
drank
away
all
that
his
wife
and
son
so
hardly
earned
louisa
used
to
weep
but
she
dared
not
resist
since
her
husband
had
harshly
reminded
her
that
nothing
in
the
house
belonged
to
her
and
that
he
had
married
her
without
a
sou
tried
to
resist
melchior
boxed
his
ears
treated
him
like
a
naughty
child
and
took
the
money
out
of
his
hands
the
boy
was
twelve
or
thirteen
he
was
strong
and
was
beginning
to
kick
against
being
beaten
but
he
was
still
afraid
to
rebel
and
rather
than
expose
himself
to
fresh
humiliations
of
the
kind
he
let
himself
be
plundered
the
only
resource
that
louisa
and
had
was
to
hide
their
money
but
melchior
was
singularly
ingenious
in
discovering
their
when
they
were
not
there
soon
that
was
not
enough
for
him
he
sold
the
things
that
he
had
inherited
from
his
father
sadly
saw
the
precious
relics
go
the
books
the
bed
the
furniture
the
portraits
of
musicians
he
could
say
nothing
but
one
day
when
melchior
had
crashed
into
jean
michel
old
piano
he
swore
as
he
rubbed
his
knee
and
said
that
there
was
no
longer
room
to
move
about
in
his
own
house
and
that
he
would
rid
the
house
of
all
such
gimcrackery
cried
aloud
it
was
true
that
the
rooms
were
too
full
since
all
jean
michel
belongings
were
crowded
into
them
so
as
to
be
able
to
sell
the
house
that
dear
house
in
which
had
spent
the
happiest
hours
of
his
childhood
it
was
true
also
that
the
old
piano
was
not
worth
much
that
it
was
husky
in
tone
and
that
for
a
long
time
had
not
used
it
since
he
played
on
the
fine
new
piano
due
to
the
generosity
of
the
prince
but
however
old
and
useless
it
might
be
it
was
best
friend
it
had
awakened
the
child
to
the
boundless
world
of
music
on
its
worn
yellow
keys
he
had
discovered
with
his
fingers
the
kingdom
of
sounds
and
its
laws
it
had
been
his
grandfather
work
months
had
gone
to
repairing
it
for
his
grandson
and
he
was
proud
of
it
it
was
in
some
sort
a
holy
relic
and
protested
that
his
father
had
no
right
to
sell
it
melchior
bade
him
be
silent
cried
louder
than
ever
that
the
piano
was
his
and
that
he
forbade
any
one
to
touch
it
but
melchior
looked
at
him
with
an
evil
smile
and
said
nothing
next
day
had
forgotten
the
affair
he
came
home
tired
but
in
a
fairly
good
temper
he
was
struck
by
the
sly
looks
of
his
brothers
they
pretended
to
be
absorbed
in
their
books
but
they
followed
him
with
their
eyes
and
watched
all
his
movements
and
bent
over
their
books
again
when
he
looked
at
them
he
had
no
doubt
that
they
had
played
some
trick
upon
him
but
he
was
used
to
that
and
did
not
worry
about
it
but
determined
when
he
had
found
it
out
to
give
them
a
good
thrashing
as
he
always
did
on
such
occasions
he
scorned
to
look
into
the
matter
and
he
began
to
talk
to
his
father
who
was
sitting
by
the
fire
and
questioned
him
as
to
the
doings
of
the
day
with
an
affectation
of
interest
which
suited
him
but
ill
and
while
he
talked
he
saw
that
melchior
was
exchanging
stealthy
nods
and
winks
with
the
two
children
something
caught
at
his
heart
he
ran
into
his
room
the
place
where
the
piano
had
stood
was
empty
he
gave
a
cry
of
anguish
in
the
next
room
he
heard
the
stifled
laughter
of
his
brothers
the
blood
rushed
to
his
face
he
rushed
in
to
them
and
cried
my
piano
melchior
raised
his
head
with
an
air
of
calm
bewilderment
which
made
the
children
roar
with
laughter
he
could
not
contain
himself
when
he
saw
piteous
look
and
he
turned
aside
to
guffaw
no
longer
knew
what
he
was
doing
he
hurled
himself
like
a
mad
thing
on
his
father
melchior
lolling
in
his
chair
had
no
time
to
protect
himself
the
boy
seized
him
by
the
throat
and
cried
thief
thief
it
was
only
for
a
moment
melchior
shook
himself
and
sent
rolling
down
on
to
the
tile
floor
though
in
his
fury
he
was
clinging
to
him
like
grim
death
the
boy
head
crashed
against
the
tiles
got
upon
his
knees
he
was
livid
and
he
went
on
saying
in
a
choking
voice
thief
thief
you
are
robbing
us
mother
and
me
thief
you
are
selling
my
grandfather
melchior
rose
to
his
feet
and
held
his
fist
above
head
the
boy
stared
at
him
with
hate
in
his
eyes
he
was
trembling
with
rage
melchior
began
to
tremble
too
he
sat
down
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
the
two
children
had
run
away
screaming
silence
followed
the
uproar
melchior
groaned
and
mumbled
against
the
wall
never
ceased
glaring
at
him
with
clenched
teeth
and
he
trembled
in
every
limb
melchior
began
to
blame
himself
i
am
a
thief
i
rob
my
family
my
children
despise
me
it
were
better
if
i
were
dead
when
he
had
finished
whining
did
not
budge
but
asked
him
harshly
where
is
the
piano
at
wormser
said
melchior
not
daring
to
look
at
him
took
a
step
forward
and
said
the
money
melchior
crushed
took
the
money
from
his
pocket
and
gave
it
to
his
son
turned
towards
the
door
melchior
called
him
stopped
melchior
went
on
in
a
quavering
voice
dear
do
not
despise
me
flung
his
arms
round
his
neck
and
sobbed
no
father
dear
father
i
do
not
despise
you
i
am
so
unhappy
they
wept
loudly
melchior
lamented
it
is
not
my
fault
i
am
not
bad
that
true
i
am
not
bad
he
promised
that
he
would
drink
no
more
wagged
his
head
doubtfully
and
melchior
admitted
that
he
could
not
resist
it
when
he
had
money
in
his
hands
thought
for
a
moment
and
said
you
see
father
we
must
he
stopped
what
then
i
am
ashamed
of
whom
asked
melchior
naïvely
of
you
melchior
made
a
face
and
said
that
nothing
explained
that
they
would
have
to
put
all
the
family
money
even
melchior
contribution
into
the
hands
of
some
one
else
who
would
dole
it
out
to
melchior
day
by
day
or
week
by
week
as
he
needed
it
melchior
who
was
in
humble
mood
he
was
not
altogether
starving
agreed
to
the
proposition
and
declared
that
he
would
then
and
there
write
a
letter
to
the
grand
duke
to
ask
that
the
pension
which
came
to
him
should
be
regularly
paid
over
in
his
name
to
refused
blushing
for
his
father
humiliation
but
melchior
thirsting
for
insisted
on
writing
he
was
much
moved
by
his
own
magnanimity
refused
to
take
the
letter
and
when
louisa
came
in
and
was
acquainted
with
the
turn
of
events
she
declared
that
she
would
rather
beg
in
the
streets
than
expose
her
husband
to
such
an
insult
she
added
that
she
had
every
confidence
in
him
and
that
she
was
sure
he
would
make
amends
out
of
love
for
the
children
and
herself
in
the
end
there
was
a
scene
of
tender
reconciliation
and
melchior
letter
was
left
on
the
table
and
then
fell
under
the
cupboard
where
it
remained
concealed
but
a
few
days
later
when
she
was
cleaning
up
louisa
found
it
there
and
as
she
was
very
unhappy
about
melchior
fresh
outbreaks
he
had
forgotten
all
about
it
instead
of
tearing
it
up
she
kept
it
she
kept
it
for
several
months
always
rejecting
the
idea
of
making
use
of
it
in
spite
of
the
suffering
she
had
to
endure
but
one
day
when
she
saw
melchior
once
more
beating
and
robbing
him
of
his
money
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
when
she
was
left
alone
with
the
boy
who
was
weeping
she
went
and
fetched
the
letter
and
gave
it
him
and
said
go
hesitated
but
he
understood
that
there
was
no
other
way
if
they
wished
to
save
from
the
wreck
the
little
that
was
left
to
them
he
went
to
the
palace
he
took
nearly
an
hour
to
walk
a
distance
that
ordinarily
took
twenty
minutes
he
was
overwhelmed
by
the
shame
of
what
he
was
doing
his
pride
which
had
grown
great
in
the
years
of
sorrow
and
isolation
bled
at
the
thought
of
publicly
confessing
his
father
vice
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
it
was
known
to
everybody
but
by
a
strange
and
natural
inconsequence
he
would
not
admit
it
and
pretended
to
notice
nothing
and
he
would
rather
have
been
hewn
in
pieces
than
agree
and
now
of
his
own
accord
he
was
going
twenty
times
he
was
on
the
point
of
turning
back
he
walked
two
or
three
times
round
the
town
turning
away
just
as
he
came
near
the
palace
he
was
not
alone
in
his
plight
his
mother
and
brothers
had
also
to
be
considered
since
his
father
had
deserted
them
and
betrayed
them
it
was
his
business
as
eldest
son
to
take
his
place
and
come
to
their
assistance
there
was
no
room
for
hesitation
or
pride
he
had
to
swallow
down
his
shame
he
entered
the
palace
on
the
staircase
he
almost
turned
and
fled
he
knelt
down
on
a
step
he
stayed
for
several
minutes
on
the
landing
with
his
hand
on
the
door
until
some
one
coming
made
him
go
in
every
one
in
the
offices
knew
him
he
asked
to
see
his
excellency
the
director
of
the
theaters
baron
de
hammer
langbach
a
young
clerk
sleek
bald
with
a
white
waistcoat
and
a
pink
tie
shook
his
hand
familiarly
and
began
to
talk
about
the
opera
of
the
night
before
repeated
his
question
the
clerk
replied
that
his
excellency
was
busy
for
the
moment
but
that
if
had
a
request
to
make
they
could
present
it
with
other
documents
which
were
to
be
sent
in
for
his
excellency
signature
held
out
his
letter
the
clerk
read
it
and
gave
a
cry
of
surprise
oh
indeed
he
said
brightly
that
is
a
good
idea
he
ought
to
have
thought
of
that
long
ago
he
never
did
anything
better
in
his
life
ah
the
old
sot
how
the
devil
did
he
bring
himself
to
do
it
he
stopped
short
had
snatched
the
paper
out
of
his
hands
and
white
with
rage
shouted
i
forbid
you
i
forbid
you
to
insult
me
the
clerk
was
staggered
but
my
dear
he
began
to
say
whoever
thought
of
insulting
you
i
only
said
what
everybody
thinks
and
what
you
think
yourself
no
cried
angrily
what
you
do
think
so
you
do
think
that
he
drinks
it
is
not
true
said
he
stamped
his
foot
the
clerk
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
that
case
why
did
he
write
this
letter
because
said
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
because
when
i
come
for
my
wages
every
month
i
prefer
to
take
my
father
at
the
same
time
it
is
no
good
our
both
putting
ourselves
out
my
father
is
very
busy
he
reddened
at
the
absurdity
of
his
explanation
the
clerk
looked
at
him
with
pity
and
irony
in
his
eyes
crumpled
the
paper
in
his
hands
and
turned
to
go
the
clerk
got
up
and
took
him
by
the
arm
wait
a
moment
he
said
i
go
and
fix
it
up
for
you
he
went
into
the
director
office
waited
with
the
eyes
of
the
other
clerks
upon
him
his
blood
boiled
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
doing
what
to
do
or
what
he
ought
to
do
he
thought
of
going
away
before
the
answer
was
brought
to
him
and
he
had
just
made
up
his
mind
to
that
when
the
door
opened
his
excellency
will
see
you
said
the
too
obliging
clerk
had
to
go
in
his
excellency
baron
de
hammer
langbach
a
little
neat
old
man
with
whiskers
mustaches
and
a
shaven
chin
looked
at
over
his
golden
spectacles
without
stopping
writing
nor
did
he
give
any
response
to
the
boy
awkward
bow
so
he
said
after
a
moment
you
are
asking
herr
krafft
your
excellency
said
hurriedly
i
ask
your
pardon
i
have
thought
better
of
it
i
have
nothing
to
ask
the
old
man
sought
no
explanation
for
this
sudden
reconsideration
he
looked
more
closely
at
coughed
and
said
herr
krafft
will
you
give
me
the
letter
that
is
in
your
hand
saw
that
the
director
gaze
was
fixed
on
the
paper
which
he
was
still
unconsciously
holding
crumpled
up
in
his
hand
it
is
no
use
your
excellency
he
murmured
it
is
not
worth
while
now
please
give
it
me
said
the
old
man
quietly
as
though
he
had
not
heard
mechanically
gave
him
the
crumpled
letter
but
he
plunged
into
a
torrent
of
stuttered
words
while
he
held
out
his
hand
for
the
letter
his
excellency
carefully
smoothed
out
the
paper
read
it
looked
at
let
him
flounder
about
with
his
explanations
then
checked
him
and
said
with
a
malicious
light
in
his
eyes
very
well
herr
krafft
the
request
is
granted
he
dismissed
him
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
and
went
on
with
his
writing
went
out
crushed
no
offense
said
the
clerk
kindly
when
the
boy
came
into
the
office
again
let
him
shake
his
hand
without
daring
to
raise
his
eyes
he
found
himself
outside
the
palace
he
was
cold
with
shame
everything
that
had
been
said
to
him
recurred
in
his
memory
and
he
imagined
that
there
was
an
insulting
irony
in
the
pity
of
the
people
who
honored
and
were
sorry
for
him
he
went
home
and
answered
only
with
a
few
irritable
words
louisa
questions
as
though
he
bore
a
grudge
against
her
for
what
he
had
just
done
he
was
racked
by
remorse
when
he
thought
of
his
father
he
wanted
to
confess
everything
to
him
and
to
beg
his
pardon
melchior
was
not
there
kept
awake
far
into
the
night
waiting
for
him
the
more
he
thought
of
him
the
more
his
remorse
quickened
he
idealized
him
he
thought
of
him
as
weak
kind
unhappy
betrayed
by
his
own
family
as
soon
as
he
heard
his
step
on
the
stairs
he
leaped
from
his
bed
to
go
and
meet
him
and
throw
himself
in
his
arms
but
melchior
was
in
such
a
disgusting
state
of
intoxication
that
had
not
even
the
courage
to
go
near
him
and
he
went
to
bed
again
laughing
bitterly
at
his
own
illusions
when
melchior
learned
a
few
days
later
of
what
had
happened
he
was
in
a
towering
passion
and
in
spite
of
all
entreaties
he
went
and
made
a
scene
at
the
palace
but
he
returned
with
his
tail
between
his
legs
and
breathed
not
a
word
of
what
had
happened
he
had
been
very
badly
received
he
had
been
told
that
he
would
have
to
take
a
very
different
tone
about
the
matter
that
the
pension
had
only
been
continued
out
of
consideration
for
the
worth
of
his
son
and
that
if
in
the
future
there
came
any
scandal
concerning
him
to
their
ears
it
would
be
suppressed
and
so
was
much
surprised
and
comforted
to
see
his
father
accept
his
living
from
day
to
day
and
even
boast
about
having
taken
the
initiative
in
the
but
that
did
not
keep
melchior
from
complaining
outside
that
he
had
been
robbed
by
his
wife
and
children
that
he
had
put
himself
out
for
them
all
his
life
and
that
now
they
let
him
want
for
everything
he
tried
also
to
extract
money
from
by
all
sorts
of
ingenious
tricks
and
devices
which
often
used
to
make
laugh
although
he
was
hardly
ever
taken
in
by
them
but
as
held
firm
melchior
did
not
insist
he
was
curiously
intimidated
by
the
severity
in
the
eyes
of
this
boy
of
fourteen
who
judged
him
he
used
to
avenge
himself
by
some
stealthy
dirty
trick
he
used
to
go
to
the
cabaret
and
eat
and
drink
as
much
as
he
pleased
and
then
pay
nothing
pretending
that
his
son
would
pay
his
debts
did
not
protest
for
fear
of
increasing
the
scandal
and
he
and
louisa
exhausted
their
resources
in
discharging
melchior
debts
in
the
end
melchior
more
and
more
lost
interest
in
his
work
as
violinist
since
he
no
longer
received
his
wages
and
his
absence
from
the
theater
became
so
frequent
that
in
spite
of
entreaties
they
had
to
dismiss
him
the
boy
was
left
to
support
his
father
his
brothers
and
the
whole
household
so
at
fourteen
became
the
head
of
the
family
he
stoutly
faced
his
formidable
task
his
pride
would
not
allow
him
to
resort
to
the
charity
of
others
he
vowed
that
he
would
pull
through
alone
from
his
earliest
days
he
had
suffered
too
much
from
seeing
his
mother
accept
and
even
ask
for
humiliating
charitable
offerings
he
used
to
argue
the
matter
with
her
when
she
returned
home
triumphant
with
some
present
that
she
had
obtained
from
one
of
her
patronesses
she
saw
no
harm
in
it
and
was
glad
to
be
able
thanks
to
the
money
to
spare
a
little
and
to
bring
another
meager
dish
forth
for
supper
but
would
become
gloomy
and
would
not
talk
all
evening
and
would
even
refuse
without
giving
any
reason
to
touch
food
gained
in
this
way
louisa
was
vexed
and
clumsily
urged
her
son
to
eat
he
was
not
to
be
budged
and
in
the
end
she
would
lose
her
temper
and
say
unkind
things
to
him
and
he
would
retort
then
he
would
fling
his
napkin
on
the
table
and
go
out
his
father
would
shrug
his
shoulders
and
call
him
a
his
brothers
would
laugh
at
him
and
eat
his
portion
but
he
had
somehow
to
find
a
livelihood
his
earnings
from
the
orchestra
were
not
enough
he
gave
lessons
his
talents
as
an
instrumentalist
his
good
reputation
and
above
all
the
prince
patronage
brought
him
a
numerous
among
the
middle
classes
every
morning
from
nine
on
he
taught
the
piano
to
little
girls
many
of
them
older
than
himself
who
frightened
him
horribly
with
their
coquetry
and
maddened
him
with
the
clumsiness
of
their
playing
they
were
absolutely
stupid
as
far
as
music
went
but
on
the
other
hand
they
had
all
more
or
less
a
keen
sense
of
ridicule
and
their
mocking
looks
spared
none
of
awkwardnesses
it
was
torture
for
him
sitting
by
their
side
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
stiff
and
red
in
the
face
bursting
with
anger
and
not
daring
to
stir
controlling
himself
so
as
not
to
say
stupid
things
and
afraid
of
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
so
that
he
could
hardly
speak
a
word
trying
to
look
severe
and
feeling
that
his
pupil
was
looking
at
him
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
he
would
lose
countenance
grow
confused
in
the
middle
of
a
remark
fearing
to
make
himself
ridiculous
he
would
become
so
and
break
out
into
violent
reproach
but
it
was
very
easy
for
his
pupils
to
avenge
themselves
and
they
did
not
fail
to
do
so
and
upset
him
by
a
certain
way
of
looking
at
him
and
by
asking
him
the
simplest
questions
which
made
him
blush
up
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
or
they
would
ask
him
to
do
them
some
small
service
such
as
fetching
something
they
had
forgotten
from
a
piece
of
furniture
and
that
was
for
him
a
most
painful
ordeal
for
he
had
to
cross
the
room
under
fire
of
malicious
looks
which
pitilessly
remarked
the
least
awkwardness
in
his
movements
and
his
clumsy
legs
his
stiff
arms
his
body
cramped
by
his
shyness
from
these
lessons
he
had
to
hasten
to
rehearsal
at
the
theater
often
he
had
no
time
for
lunch
and
he
used
to
carry
a
piece
of
bread
and
some
cold
meat
in
his
pocket
to
eat
during
the
interval
sometimes
he
had
to
take
the
place
of
tobias
pfeiffer
the
who
was
interested
in
him
and
sometimes
had
him
to
conduct
the
orchestra
rehearsals
instead
of
himself
and
he
had
also
to
go
on
with
his
own
musical
education
other
piano
lessons
filled
his
day
until
the
hour
of
the
performance
and
very
often
in
the
evening
after
the
play
he
was
sent
for
to
play
at
the
palace
there
he
had
to
play
for
an
hour
or
two
the
princess
laid
claim
to
a
knowledge
of
music
she
was
very
fond
of
it
but
had
never
been
able
to
perceive
the
difference
between
good
and
bad
she
used
to
make
play
through
strange
programmes
in
which
dull
rhapsodies
stood
side
by
side
with
masterpieces
but
her
greatest
pleasure
was
to
make
him
improvise
and
she
used
to
provide
him
with
heartbreakingly
sentimental
themes
used
to
leave
about
midnight
worn
out
with
his
hands
burning
his
head
aching
his
stomach
empty
he
was
in
a
sweat
and
outside
snow
would
be
falling
or
there
would
be
an
icy
fog
he
had
to
walk
across
half
the
town
to
reach
home
he
went
on
foot
his
teeth
chattering
longing
to
sleep
and
to
cry
and
he
had
to
take
care
not
to
splash
his
only
evening
in
the
puddles
he
would
go
up
to
his
room
which
he
still
shared
with
his
brothers
and
never
was
he
so
overwhelmed
by
disgust
and
despair
with
his
life
as
at
the
moment
when
in
his
attic
with
its
stifling
smell
he
was
at
last
permitted
to
take
off
the
halter
of
his
misery
he
had
hardly
the
heart
to
undress
himself
happily
no
sooner
did
his
head
touch
the
pillow
than
he
would
sink
into
a
heavy
sleep
which
deprived
him
of
all
consciousness
of
his
troubles
but
he
had
to
get
up
by
dawn
in
summer
and
before
dawn
in
winter
he
wished
to
do
his
own
work
it
was
all
the
free
time
that
he
had
between
five
and
eight
even
then
he
had
to
waste
some
of
it
by
work
to
command
for
his
title
of
and
his
favor
with
the
grand
duke
exacted
from
him
official
compositions
for
the
court
festivals
so
the
very
source
of
his
life
was
poisoned
even
his
dreams
were
not
free
but
as
usual
this
restraint
made
them
only
the
stronger
when
nothing
hampers
action
the
soul
has
fewer
reasons
for
action
and
the
closer
the
walls
of
prison
of
care
and
banal
tasks
were
drawn
about
him
the
more
his
heart
in
its
revolt
felt
its
independence
in
a
life
without
obstacles
he
would
doubtless
have
abandoned
himself
to
chance
and
to
the
voluptuous
sauntering
of
adolescence
as
he
could
be
free
only
for
an
hour
or
two
a
day
his
strength
flowed
into
that
space
of
time
like
a
river
between
walls
of
rock
it
is
a
good
discipline
for
art
for
a
man
to
confine
his
efforts
between
unshakable
bounds
in
that
sense
it
may
be
said
that
misery
is
a
master
not
only
of
thought
but
of
style
it
teaches
sobriety
to
the
mind
as
to
the
body
when
time
is
doled
out
and
thoughts
measured
a
man
says
no
word
too
much
and
grows
accustomed
to
thinking
only
what
is
essential
so
he
lives
at
double
pressure
having
less
time
for
living
this
had
happened
in
case
under
his
yoke
he
took
full
stock
of
the
value
of
liberty
and
he
never
frittered
away
the
precious
minutes
with
useless
words
or
actions
his
natural
tendency
to
write
diffusely
given
up
to
all
the
caprice
of
a
mind
sincere
but
indiscriminating
found
correction
in
being
forced
to
think
and
do
as
much
as
possible
in
the
least
possible
time
nothing
had
so
much
influence
on
his
artistic
and
moral
development
not
the
lessons
of
his
masters
nor
the
example
of
the
masterpieces
during
the
years
when
the
character
is
formed
he
came
to
consider
music
as
an
exact
language
in
which
every
sound
has
a
meaning
and
at
the
same
time
he
came
to
loathe
those
musicians
who
talk
without
saying
anything
and
yet
the
compositions
which
he
wrote
at
this
time
were
still
far
from
expressing
himself
completely
because
he
was
still
very
far
from
having
completely
discovered
himself
he
was
seeking
himself
through
the
mass
of
acquired
feelings
which
education
imposes
on
a
child
as
second
nature
he
had
only
intuitions
of
his
true
being
until
he
should
feel
the
passions
of
adolescence
which
strip
the
personality
of
its
borrowed
garments
as
a
purges
the
sky
of
the
mists
that
hang
over
it
vague
and
great
forebodings
were
mingled
in
him
with
strange
memories
of
which
he
could
not
rid
himself
he
raged
against
these
lies
he
was
wretched
to
see
how
inferior
what
he
wrote
was
to
what
he
thought
he
had
bitter
doubts
of
himself
but
he
could
not
resign
himself
to
such
a
stupid
defeat
he
longed
passionately
to
do
better
to
write
great
things
and
always
he
missed
fire
after
a
moment
of
illusion
as
he
wrote
he
saw
that
what
he
had
done
was
worthless
he
tore
it
up
he
burned
everything
that
he
did
and
to
crown
his
humiliation
he
had
to
see
his
official
works
the
most
mediocre
of
all
preserved
and
he
could
not
destroy
them
the
concerto
royal
for
the
prince
birthday
and
the
cantata
marriage
of
written
on
the
occasion
of
the
marriage
of
princess
adelaide
published
at
great
expense
in
de
which
perpetuated
his
imbecilities
for
posterity
for
he
believed
in
posterity
he
wept
in
his
humiliation
fevered
years
no
respite
no
release
nothing
to
create
a
diversion
from
such
maddening
toil
no
games
no
friends
how
should
he
have
them
in
the
afternoon
when
other
children
played
young
with
his
brows
knit
in
attention
was
at
his
place
in
the
orchestra
in
the
dusty
and
theater
and
in
the
evening
when
other
children
were
abed
he
was
still
there
sitting
in
his
chair
bowed
with
weariness
no
intimacy
with
his
brothers
the
younger
ernest
was
twelve
he
was
a
little
ragamuffin
vicious
and
impudent
who
spent
his
days
with
other
rapscallions
like
himself
and
from
their
company
had
caught
not
only
deplorable
manners
but
shameful
habits
which
good
who
had
never
so
much
as
suspected
their
existence
was
horrified
to
see
one
day
the
other
rodolphe
the
favorite
of
uncle
theodore
was
to
go
into
business
he
was
steady
quiet
but
sly
he
thought
himself
much
superior
to
and
did
not
admit
his
authority
in
the
house
although
it
seemed
natural
to
him
to
eat
the
food
that
he
provided
he
had
espoused
the
cause
of
theodore
and
melchior
against
and
used
to
repeat
their
absurd
gossip
neither
of
the
brothers
cared
for
music
and
rodolphe
in
imitation
of
his
uncle
affected
to
despise
it
chafing
against
authority
and
lectures
for
he
took
himself
very
seriously
as
the
head
of
the
family
the
two
boys
had
tried
to
rebel
but
who
had
lusty
fists
and
the
consciousness
of
right
sent
them
packing
still
they
did
not
for
that
cease
to
do
with
him
as
they
liked
they
abused
his
credulity
and
laid
traps
for
him
into
which
he
invariably
fell
they
used
to
extort
money
from
him
with
barefaced
lies
and
laughed
at
him
behind
his
back
was
always
taken
in
he
had
so
much
need
of
being
loved
that
an
affectionate
word
was
enough
to
disarm
his
rancor
he
would
have
forgiven
them
everything
for
a
little
love
but
his
confidence
was
cruelly
shaken
when
he
heard
them
laughing
at
his
stupidity
after
a
scene
of
hypocritical
embracing
which
had
moved
him
to
tears
and
they
had
taken
advantage
of
it
to
rob
him
of
a
gold
watch
a
present
from
the
prince
which
they
coveted
he
despised
them
and
yet
went
on
letting
himself
be
taken
in
from
his
unconquerable
tendency
to
trust
and
to
love
he
knew
it
he
raged
against
himself
and
he
used
to
thrash
his
brothers
soundly
when
he
discovered
once
more
that
they
had
tricked
him
that
did
not
keep
him
from
swallowing
almost
immediately
the
fresh
hook
which
it
pleased
them
to
bait
for
him
a
more
bitter
cause
of
suffering
was
in
store
for
him
he
learned
from
officious
neighbors
that
his
father
was
speaking
ill
of
him
after
having
been
proud
of
his
son
successes
and
having
boasted
of
them
everywhere
melchior
was
weak
and
shameful
enough
to
be
jealous
of
them
he
tried
to
decry
them
it
was
stupid
to
weep
could
only
shrug
his
shoulders
in
contempt
it
was
no
use
being
angry
about
it
for
his
father
did
not
know
what
he
was
doing
and
was
embittered
by
his
own
downfall
the
boy
said
nothing
he
was
afraid
if
he
said
anything
of
being
too
hard
but
he
was
cut
to
the
heart
they
were
melancholy
gatherings
at
the
family
evening
meal
round
the
lamp
with
a
spotted
cloth
with
all
the
stupid
chatter
and
the
sound
of
the
jaws
of
these
people
whom
he
despised
and
pitied
and
yet
loved
in
spite
of
everything
only
between
himself
and
his
brave
mother
did
feel
a
bond
of
affection
but
louisa
like
himself
exhausted
herself
during
the
day
and
in
the
evening
she
was
worn
out
and
hardly
spoke
and
after
dinner
used
to
sleep
in
her
chair
over
her
darning
and
she
was
so
good
that
she
seemed
to
make
no
difference
in
her
love
between
her
husband
and
her
three
sons
she
loved
them
all
equally
did
not
find
in
her
the
trusted
friend
that
he
so
much
needed
so
he
was
driven
in
upon
himself
for
days
together
he
would
not
speak
fulfilling
his
tiresome
and
wearing
task
with
a
sort
of
silent
rage
such
a
mode
of
living
was
dangerous
especially
for
a
child
at
a
critical
age
when
he
is
most
sensitive
and
is
exposed
to
every
agent
of
destruction
and
the
risk
of
being
deformed
for
the
rest
of
his
life
health
suffered
seriously
he
had
been
endowed
by
his
parents
with
a
healthy
constitution
and
a
sound
and
healthy
body
but
his
very
healthiness
only
served
to
feed
his
suffering
when
the
weight
of
weariness
and
too
early
cares
had
opened
up
a
gap
by
which
it
might
enter
quite
early
in
life
there
were
signs
of
grave
nervous
disorders
when
he
was
a
small
boy
he
was
subject
to
and
convulsions
and
vomiting
whenever
he
encountered
opposition
when
he
was
seven
or
eight
about
the
time
of
the
concert
his
sleep
had
been
troubled
he
used
to
talk
cry
laugh
and
weep
in
his
sleep
and
this
habit
returned
to
him
whenever
he
had
too
much
to
think
of
then
he
had
cruel
headaches
sometimes
shooting
pains
at
the
base
of
his
skull
or
the
top
of
his
head
sometimes
a
leaden
heaviness
his
eyes
troubled
him
sometimes
it
was
as
though
needles
were
piercing
his
eyeballs
he
was
subject
to
fits
of
dizziness
when
he
could
not
see
to
read
and
had
to
stop
for
a
minute
or
two
insufficient
and
unsound
food
and
irregular
meals
ruined
the
health
of
his
stomach
he
was
racked
by
internal
pains
or
exhausted
by
diarrhea
but
nothing
brought
him
more
suffering
than
his
heart
it
beat
with
a
crazy
irregularity
sometimes
it
would
leap
in
his
bosom
and
seem
like
to
break
sometimes
it
would
hardly
beat
at
all
and
seem
like
to
stop
at
night
his
temperature
would
vary
alarmingly
it
would
change
suddenly
from
to
next
to
nothing
he
would
burn
then
shiver
with
cold
pass
through
agony
his
throat
would
go
dry
a
lump
in
it
would
prevent
his
breathing
naturally
his
imagination
took
fire
he
dared
not
say
anything
to
his
family
of
what
he
was
going
through
but
he
was
continually
dissecting
it
with
a
minuteness
which
either
enlarged
his
sufferings
or
created
new
ones
he
decided
that
he
had
every
known
illness
one
after
the
other
he
believed
that
he
was
going
blind
and
as
he
sometimes
used
to
turn
giddy
as
he
walked
he
thought
that
he
was
going
to
fall
down
dead
always
that
dreadful
fear
of
being
stopped
on
his
road
of
dying
before
his
time
obsessed
him
overwhelmed
him
and
pursued
him
ah
if
he
had
to
die
at
least
let
it
not
be
now
not
before
he
had
tasted
victory
victory
the
fixed
idea
which
never
ceases
to
burn
within
him
without
his
being
fully
aware
of
it
the
idea
which
bears
him
up
through
all
his
disgust
and
fatigues
and
the
stagnant
morass
of
such
a
life
a
dim
and
great
foreknowledge
of
what
he
will
be
some
day
of
what
he
is
already
what
is
he
a
sick
nervous
child
who
plays
the
violin
in
the
orchestra
and
writes
mediocre
concertos
no
far
more
than
such
a
child
that
is
no
more
than
the
wrapping
the
seeming
of
a
day
that
is
not
his
being
there
is
no
connection
between
his
being
and
the
existing
shape
of
his
face
and
thought
he
knows
that
well
when
he
looks
at
himself
in
the
mirror
he
does
not
know
himself
that
broad
red
face
those
prominent
eyebrows
those
little
sunken
eyes
that
short
thick
nose
that
sullen
mouth
the
whole
mask
ugly
and
vulgar
is
foreign
to
himself
neither
does
he
know
himself
in
his
writings
he
judges
he
knows
that
what
he
does
and
what
he
is
are
nothing
and
yet
he
is
sure
of
what
he
will
be
and
do
sometimes
he
falls
foul
of
such
certainty
as
a
vain
lie
he
takes
pleasure
in
humiliating
himself
and
bitterly
mortifying
himself
by
way
of
punishment
but
his
certainty
endures
nothing
can
alter
it
whatever
he
does
whatever
he
thinks
none
of
his
thoughts
actions
or
writings
contain
him
or
express
him
he
knows
he
has
this
strange
presentiment
that
the
more
that
he
is
is
not
contained
in
the
present
but
is
what
he
what
he
be
he
will
be
he
is
fired
by
that
faith
he
is
intoxicated
by
that
light
ah
if
only
does
not
block
the
way
if
only
he
does
not
fall
into
one
of
the
cunning
traps
which
is
forever
laying
for
him
so
he
steers
his
bark
across
the
sea
of
days
turning
his
eyes
neither
to
right
nor
left
motionless
at
the
helm
with
his
gaze
fixed
on
the
bourne
the
refuge
the
end
that
he
has
in
sight
in
the
orchestra
among
the
talkative
musicians
at
table
with
his
own
family
at
the
palace
while
he
is
playing
without
a
thought
of
what
he
is
playing
for
the
entertainment
of
royal
folk
it
is
in
that
future
that
future
which
a
speck
may
bring
toppling
to
earth
no
matter
it
is
in
that
that
he
lives
he
is
at
his
old
piano
in
his
garret
alone
night
falls
the
dying
light
of
day
is
cast
upon
his
music
he
strains
his
eyes
to
read
the
notes
until
the
last
ray
of
light
is
dead
the
tenderness
of
hearts
that
are
dead
breathed
forth
from
the
dumb
page
fills
him
with
love
his
eyes
are
filled
with
tears
it
seems
to
him
that
a
beloved
creature
is
standing
behind
him
that
soft
breathing
caresses
his
cheek
that
two
arms
are
about
his
neck
he
turns
trembling
he
feels
he
knows
that
he
is
not
alone
a
soul
that
loves
and
is
loved
is
there
near
him
he
groans
aloud
because
he
can
not
perceive
it
and
yet
that
shadow
of
bitterness
falling
upon
his
ecstasy
has
sweetness
too
even
sadness
has
its
light
he
thinks
of
his
beloved
masters
of
the
genius
that
is
gone
though
its
soul
lives
on
in
the
music
which
it
had
lived
in
its
life
his
heart
is
overflowing
with
love
he
dreams
of
the
superhuman
happiness
which
must
have
been
the
lot
of
these
glorious
men
since
the
reflection
only
of
their
happiness
is
still
so
much
aflame
he
dreams
of
being
like
them
of
giving
out
such
love
as
this
with
lost
rays
to
lighten
his
misery
with
a
godlike
smile
in
his
turn
to
be
a
god
to
give
out
the
warmth
of
joy
to
be
a
sun
of
life
alas
if
one
day
he
does
become
the
equal
of
those
whom
he
loves
if
he
does
achieve
that
brilliant
happiness
for
which
he
longs
he
will
see
the
illusion
that
was
upon
him
ii
otto
one
sunday
when
had
been
invited
by
his
to
dine
at
the
little
country
house
which
tobias
pfeiffer
owned
an
journey
from
the
town
he
took
the
rhine
steamboat
on
deck
he
sat
next
to
a
boy
about
his
own
age
who
eagerly
made
room
for
him
paid
no
attention
but
after
a
moment
feeling
that
his
neighbor
had
never
taken
his
eyes
off
him
he
turned
and
looked
at
him
he
was
a
fair
boy
with
round
pink
cheeks
with
his
hair
parted
on
one
side
and
a
shade
of
down
on
his
lip
he
looked
frankly
what
he
was
a
hobbledehoy
though
he
made
great
efforts
to
seem
grown
up
he
was
dressed
with
ostentatious
care
flannel
suit
light
gloves
white
shoes
and
a
pale
blue
tie
and
he
carried
a
little
stick
in
his
hand
he
looked
at
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
without
turning
his
head
with
his
neck
stiff
like
a
hen
and
when
looked
at
him
he
blushed
up
to
his
ears
took
a
newspaper
from
his
pocket
and
pretended
to
be
absorbed
in
it
and
to
look
important
over
it
but
a
few
minutes
later
he
dashed
to
pick
up
hat
which
had
fallen
surprised
at
such
politeness
looked
once
more
at
the
boy
and
once
more
he
blushed
thanked
him
curtly
for
he
did
not
like
such
obsequious
eagerness
and
he
hated
to
be
fussed
with
all
the
same
he
was
flattered
by
it
soon
it
passed
from
his
thoughts
his
attention
was
occupied
by
the
view
it
was
long
since
he
had
been
able
to
escape
from
the
town
and
so
he
had
keen
pleasure
in
the
wind
that
beat
against
his
face
in
the
sound
of
the
water
against
the
boat
in
the
great
stretch
of
water
and
the
changing
spectacle
presented
by
the
banks
bluffs
gray
and
dull
half
under
water
pale
vines
legendary
rocks
towns
crowned
with
gothic
towers
and
factory
chimneys
belching
black
smoke
and
as
he
was
in
ecstasy
over
it
all
his
neighbor
in
a
choking
voice
timidly
imparted
a
few
historic
facts
concerning
the
ruins
that
they
saw
cleverly
restored
and
covered
with
ivy
he
seemed
to
be
lecturing
to
himself
roused
to
interest
plied
him
with
questions
the
other
replied
eagerly
glad
to
display
his
knowledge
and
with
every
sentence
he
addressed
himself
directly
to
calling
him
hof
you
know
me
then
said
oh
yes
said
the
boy
with
a
simple
admiration
that
tickled
vanity
they
talked
the
boy
had
often
seen
at
concerts
and
his
imagination
had
been
touched
by
everything
that
he
had
heard
about
him
he
did
not
say
so
to
but
felt
it
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
it
he
was
not
used
to
being
spoken
to
in
this
tone
of
eager
respect
he
went
on
questioning
his
neighbor
about
the
history
of
the
country
through
which
they
were
passing
the
other
set
out
all
the
knowledge
that
he
had
and
admired
his
learning
but
that
was
only
the
peg
on
which
their
conversation
hung
what
interested
them
was
the
making
of
each
other
acquaintance
they
dared
not
frankly
approach
the
subject
they
returned
to
it
again
and
again
with
awkward
questions
finally
they
plunged
and
learned
that
his
new
friend
was
called
otto
diener
and
was
the
son
of
a
rich
merchant
in
the
town
it
appeared
naturally
that
they
had
friends
in
common
and
little
by
little
their
tongues
were
loosed
they
were
talking
eagerly
when
the
boat
arrived
at
the
town
at
which
was
to
get
out
otto
got
out
too
that
surprised
them
and
proposed
that
they
should
take
a
walk
together
until
they
struck
out
across
the
fields
had
taken
otto
arm
familiarly
and
was
telling
him
his
plans
as
if
he
had
known
him
from
his
birth
he
had
been
so
much
deprived
of
the
society
of
children
of
his
own
age
that
he
found
an
inexpressible
joy
in
being
with
this
boy
so
learned
and
well
brought
up
who
was
in
sympathy
with
him
time
passed
and
took
no
count
of
it
diener
proud
of
the
confidence
which
the
young
musician
showed
him
dared
not
point
out
that
the
had
rung
at
last
he
thought
that
he
must
remind
him
of
it
but
who
had
begun
the
ascent
of
a
hill
in
the
woods
declared
that
they
most
go
to
the
top
and
when
they
reached
it
he
lay
down
on
the
grass
as
though
he
meant
to
spend
the
day
there
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
diener
seeing
that
he
seemed
to
have
no
intention
of
moving
hazarded
again
and
your
dinner
lying
at
full
length
with
his
hands
behind
his
head
said
quietly
tssh
then
he
looked
at
otto
saw
his
scared
look
and
began
to
laugh
it
is
too
good
here
he
explained
i
sha
go
let
them
wait
for
me
he
half
rose
are
you
in
a
hurry
no
do
you
know
what
we
do
we
dine
together
i
know
of
an
inn
diener
would
have
had
many
objections
to
make
not
that
any
one
was
waiting
for
him
but
because
it
was
hard
for
him
to
come
to
any
sudden
decision
whatever
it
might
be
he
was
methodical
and
needed
to
be
prepared
beforehand
but
question
was
put
in
such
a
tone
as
allowed
of
no
refusal
he
let
himself
be
dragged
off
and
they
began
to
talk
again
at
the
inn
their
eagerness
died
down
both
were
occupied
with
the
question
as
to
who
should
give
the
dinner
and
each
within
himself
made
it
a
point
of
honor
to
give
it
diener
because
he
was
the
richer
because
he
was
the
poorer
they
made
no
direct
reference
to
the
matter
but
diener
made
great
efforts
to
assert
his
right
by
the
tone
of
authority
which
he
tried
to
take
as
he
asked
for
the
menu
understood
what
he
was
at
and
turned
the
tables
on
him
by
ordering
other
dishes
of
a
rare
kind
he
wanted
to
show
that
he
was
as
much
at
his
ease
as
anybody
and
when
diener
tried
again
by
endeavoring
to
take
upon
himself
the
choice
of
wine
crushed
him
with
a
look
and
ordered
a
bottle
of
one
of
the
most
expensive
vintages
they
had
in
the
inn
when
they
found
themselves
seated
before
a
considerable
repast
they
were
abashed
by
it
they
could
find
nothing
to
say
ate
mincingly
and
were
awkward
and
constrained
in
their
movements
they
became
conscious
suddenly
that
they
were
strangers
and
they
watched
each
other
they
made
vain
efforts
to
revive
the
conversation
it
dropped
immediately
their
first
was
a
time
of
fearful
boredom
fortunately
the
meat
and
drink
soon
had
an
effect
on
them
and
they
looked
at
each
other
more
confidently
especially
who
was
not
used
to
such
good
things
became
extraordinarily
loquacious
he
told
of
the
difficulties
of
his
life
and
otto
breaking
through
his
reserve
confessed
that
he
also
was
not
happy
he
was
weak
and
timid
and
his
schoolfellows
put
upon
him
they
laughed
at
him
and
could
not
forgive
him
for
despising
their
vulgar
manners
they
played
all
sorts
of
tricks
on
him
clenched
his
fists
and
said
they
had
better
not
try
it
in
his
presence
otto
also
was
misunderstood
by
his
family
knew
the
unhappiness
of
that
and
they
commiserated
each
other
on
their
common
misfortunes
parents
wanted
him
to
become
a
merchant
and
to
step
into
his
place
but
he
wanted
to
be
a
poet
he
would
be
a
poet
even
though
he
had
to
fly
the
town
like
schiller
and
brave
poverty
his
father
fortune
would
all
come
to
him
and
it
was
considerable
he
confessed
blushingly
that
he
had
already
written
verses
on
the
sadness
of
life
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
recite
them
in
spite
of
entreaties
but
in
the
end
he
did
give
two
or
three
of
them
dithering
with
emotion
thought
them
admirable
they
exchanged
plans
later
on
they
would
work
together
they
would
write
dramas
and
they
admired
each
other
besides
his
reputation
as
a
musician
strength
and
bold
ways
made
an
impression
on
otto
and
was
sensible
of
otto
elegance
and
distinguished
manners
everything
in
this
world
is
relative
and
of
his
ease
of
manner
that
ease
of
manner
which
he
looked
and
longed
for
made
drowsy
by
their
meal
with
their
elbows
on
the
table
they
talked
and
listened
to
each
other
with
softness
in
their
eyes
the
afternoon
drew
on
they
had
to
go
otto
made
a
last
attempt
to
procure
the
bill
but
nailed
him
to
his
seat
with
an
angry
look
which
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
insist
was
only
uneasy
on
one
point
that
he
might
be
asked
for
more
than
he
had
he
would
have
given
his
watch
and
everything
that
he
had
about
him
rather
than
admit
it
to
otto
but
he
was
not
called
on
to
go
so
far
he
had
to
spend
on
the
dinner
almost
the
whole
of
his
month
money
they
went
down
the
hill
again
the
shades
of
evening
were
beginning
to
fall
over
the
their
tops
were
still
bathed
in
rosy
light
they
swung
slowly
with
a
surging
sound
the
carpet
of
purple
deadened
the
sound
of
their
footsteps
they
said
no
word
felt
a
strange
sweet
sadness
welling
through
his
heart
he
was
happy
he
wished
to
talk
but
was
weighed
down
with
his
sweet
sorrow
he
stopped
for
a
moment
and
so
did
otto
all
was
silence
flies
buzzed
high
above
them
in
a
ray
of
sunlight
a
rotten
branch
fell
took
otto
hand
and
in
a
trembling
voice
said
will
you
be
my
friend
otto
murmured
yes
they
shook
hands
their
hearts
beat
they
dared
hardly
look
at
each
other
after
a
moment
they
walked
on
they
were
a
few
paces
away
from
each
other
and
they
dared
say
no
more
until
they
were
out
of
the
woods
they
were
fearful
of
each
other
and
of
their
strange
emotion
they
walked
very
fast
and
never
stopped
until
they
had
issued
from
the
shadow
of
the
trees
then
they
took
courage
again
and
joined
hands
they
marveled
at
the
limpid
evening
falling
and
they
talked
disconnectedly
on
the
boat
sitting
at
the
bows
in
the
brilliant
twilight
they
tried
to
talk
of
trivial
matters
but
they
gave
no
heed
to
what
they
were
saying
they
were
lost
in
their
own
happiness
and
weariness
they
felt
no
need
to
talk
or
to
hold
hands
or
even
to
look
at
each
other
they
were
near
each
other
when
they
were
near
their
journey
end
they
agreed
to
meet
again
on
the
following
sunday
took
otto
to
his
door
under
the
light
of
the
gas
they
timidly
smiled
and
murmured
they
were
glad
to
part
so
wearied
were
they
by
the
tension
at
which
they
had
been
living
for
those
hours
and
by
the
pain
it
cost
them
to
break
the
silence
with
a
single
word
returned
alone
in
the
night
his
heart
was
singing
i
have
a
friend
i
have
a
friend
he
saw
nothing
he
heard
nothing
he
thought
of
nothing
else
he
was
very
sleepy
and
fell
asleep
as
soon
as
he
reached
his
room
but
he
was
awakened
twice
or
thrice
during
the
night
as
by
some
fixed
idea
he
repeated
i
have
a
friend
and
went
to
sleep
again
at
once
next
morning
it
seemed
to
be
all
a
dream
to
test
the
reality
of
it
he
tried
to
recall
the
smallest
details
of
the
day
he
was
absorbed
by
this
occupation
while
he
was
giving
his
lessons
and
even
during
the
afternoon
he
was
so
absent
during
the
orchestra
rehearsal
that
when
he
left
he
could
hardly
remember
what
he
had
been
playing
when
he
returned
home
he
found
a
letter
waiting
for
him
he
had
no
need
to
ask
himself
whence
it
came
he
ran
and
shut
himself
up
in
his
room
to
read
it
it
was
written
on
pale
blue
paper
in
a
labored
long
uncertain
hand
with

much

lovely
day

there

something
providential

that

fate

that

meet
how
glad
i
shall
be
to
see

diener
on
sunday
please
do
not
call
for
me
at
home
it
would
be
better
if
you
will
for
us
to
meet
at
the
read
the
letter
with
tears
in
his
eyes
he
kissed
it
he
laughed
aloud
he
jumped
about
on
his
bed
then
he
ran
to
the
table
and
took
pen
in
hand
to
reply
at
once
he
could
not
wait
a
moment
but
he
was
not
used
to
writing
he
could
not
express
what
was
swelling
in
his
heart
he
dug
into
the
paper
with
his
pen
and
blackened
his
fingers
with
ink
he
stamped
impatiently
at
last
by
dint
of
putting
out
his
tongue
and
making
five
or
six
drafts
he
succeeded
in
writing
in
malformed
letters
which
flew
out
in
all
directions
and
with
terrific
mistakes
in
spelling
my
soul
how
dare
you
speak
of
gratitude
because
i
love
you
have
i
not
told
you
how
sad
i
was
and
lonely
before
i
knew
you
your
friendship
is
the
greatest
of
blessings
yesterday
i
was
happy
happy
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
weep
for
joy
as
i
read
your
letter
yes
my
beloved
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
was
fate
brought
us
together
fate
wishes
that
we
should
be
friends
to
do
great
things
friends
the
lovely
word
can
it
be
that
at
last
i
have
a
friend
oh
you
will
never
leave
me
you
will
be
faithful
to
me
always
always
how
beautiful
it
will
be
to
grow
up
together
to
work
together
to
bring
together
i
my
musical
whimsies
and
all
the
crazy
things
that
go
chasing
through
my
mind
you
your
intelligence
and
amazing
learning
how
much
you
know
i
have
never
met
a
man
so
clever
as
you
there
are
moments
when
i
am
uneasy
i
seem
to
be
unworthy
of
your
friendship
you
are
so
noble
and
so
accomplished
and
i
am
so
grateful
to
you
for
loving
so
coarse
a
creature
as
myself
but
no
i
have
just
said
let
there
be
no
talk
of
gratitude
in
friendship
there
is
no
obligation
nor
benefaction
i
would
not
accept
any
benefaction
we
are
equal
since
we
love
how
impatient
i
am
to
see
you
i
will
not
call
for
you
at
home
since
you
do
not
wish
it
although
to
tell
the
truth
i
do
not
understand
all
these
precautions
but
you
are
the
wiser
you
are
surely
right
one
word
only
no
more
talk
of
money
i
hate
money
the
word
and
the
thing
itself
if
i
am
not
rich
i
am
yet
rich
enough
to
give
to
my
friend
and
it
is
my
joy
to
give
all
i
can
for
him
would
not
you
do
the
same
and
if
i
needed
it
would
you
not
be
the
first
to
give
me
all
your
fortune
but
that
shall
never
be
i
have
sound
fists
and
a
sound
head
and
i
shall
always
be
able
to
earn
the
bread
that
i
eat
till
sunday
dear
god
a
whole
week
without
seeing
you
and
for
two
days
i
have
not
seen
you
how
have
i
been
able
to
live
so
long
without
you
the
conductor
tried
to
grumble
but
do
not
bother
about
it
any
more
than
i
do
what
are
others
to
me
i
care
nothing
what
they
think
or
what
they
may
ever
think
of
me
only
you
matter
love
me
well
my
soul
love
me
as
i
love
you
i
can
not
tell
you
how
much
i
love
you
i
am
yours
yours
yours
from
the
tips
of
my
fingers
to
the
apple
of
my
eye
yours
always
was
devoured
with
impatience
for
the
rest
of
the
week
he
would
go
out
of
his
way
and
make
long
turns
to
pass
by
otto
house
not
that
he
counted
on
seeing
him
but
the
sight
of
the
house
was
enough
to
make
him
grow
pale
and
red
with
emotion
on
the
thursday
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
sent
a
second
letter
even
more
than
the
first
otto
answered
it
sentimentally
sunday
came
at
length
and
otto
was
punctually
at
the
but
had
been
there
for
an
hour
waiting
impatiently
for
the
walk
he
began
to
imagine
dreadfully
that
otto
would
not
come
he
trembled
lest
otto
should
be
ill
for
he
did
not
suppose
for
a
moment
that
otto
might
break
his
word
he
whispered
over
and
over
again
dear
god
let
him
come
let
him
come
and
he
struck
at
the
pebbles
in
the
avenue
with
his
stick
saying
to
himself
that
if
he
missed
three
times
otto
would
not
come
but
if
he
hit
them
otto
would
appear
at
once
in
spite
of
his
care
and
the
easiness
of
the
test
he
had
just
missed
three
times
when
he
saw
otto
coming
at
his
easy
deliberate
pace
for
otto
was
above
all
things
correct
even
when
he
was
most
moved
ran
to
him
and
with
his
throat
dry
wished
him
otto
replied
and
they
found
that
they
had
nothing
more
to
say
to
each
other
except
that
the
weather
was
fine
and
that
it
was
five
or
six
minutes
past
ten
or
it
might
be
ten
past
because
the
castle
clock
was
always
slow
they
went
to
the
station
and
went
by
rail
to
a
neighboring
place
which
was
a
favorite
excursion
from
the
town
on
the
way
they
exchanged
not
more
than
ten
words
they
tried
to
make
up
for
it
by
eloquent
looks
but
they
were
no
more
successful
in
vain
did
they
try
to
tell
each
other
what
friends
they
were
their
eyes
would
say
nothing
at
all
they
were
just
playacting
saw
that
and
was
humiliated
he
did
not
understand
how
he
could
not
express
or
even
feel
all
that
had
filled
his
heart
an
hour
before
otto
did
not
perhaps
so
exactly
take
stock
of
their
failure
because
he
was
less
sincere
and
examined
himself
with
more
circumspection
but
he
was
just
as
disappointed
the
truth
is
that
the
boys
had
during
their
week
of
separation
blown
out
their
feelings
to
such
a
diapason
that
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
keep
them
actually
at
that
pitch
and
when
they
met
again
their
first
impression
must
of
necessity
be
false
they
had
to
break
away
from
it
but
they
could
not
bring
themselves
to
agree
to
it
all
day
they
wandered
in
the
country
without
ever
breaking
through
the
awkwardness
and
constraint
that
were
upon
them
it
was
a
holiday
the
inns
and
woods
were
filled
with
a
rabble
of
excursionists
little
families
who
made
a
great
noise
and
ate
everywhere
that
added
to
their
they
attributed
to
the
poor
people
the
impossibility
of
again
finding
the
carelessness
of
their
first
walk
but
they
talked
they
took
great
pains
to
find
subjects
of
conversation
they
were
afraid
of
finding
that
they
had
nothing
to
say
to
each
other
otto
displayed
his
entered
into
technical
explanations
of
musical
compositions
and
they
oppressed
each
other
they
crushed
each
other
by
talking
and
they
never
stopped
talking
trembling
lest
they
should
for
then
there
opened
before
them
abysses
of
silence
which
horrified
them
otto
came
near
to
weeping
and
was
near
leaving
him
and
running
away
as
hard
as
he
could
he
was
so
bored
and
ashamed
only
an
hour
before
they
had
to
take
the
train
again
did
they
thaw
in
the
depths
of
the
woods
a
dog
was
barking
he
was
hunting
on
his
own
account
proposed
that
they
should
hide
by
his
path
to
try
and
see
his
quarry
they
ran
into
the
midst
of
the
thicket
the
dog
came
near
them
and
then
went
away
again
they
went
to
right
and
left
went
forward
and
doubled
the
barking
grew
louder
the
dog
was
choking
with
impatience
in
his
lust
for
slaughter
he
came
near
once
more
and
otto
lying
on
the
dead
leaves
in
the
rut
of
a
path
waited
and
held
their
breath
the
barking
stopped
the
dog
had
lost
the
scent
they
heard
his
yap
once
again
in
the
distance
then
silence
came
upon
the
woods
not
a
sound
only
the
mysterious
hum
of
millions
of
creatures
insects
and
creeping
things
moving
unceasingly
destroying
the
forest
the
measured
breathing
of
death
which
never
stops
the
boys
listened
they
did
not
stir
just
when
they
got
up
disappointed
and
said
it
is
all
over
he
will
not
come
a
little
hare
plunged
out
of
the
thicket
he
came
straight
upon
them
they
saw
him
at
the
same
moment
and
gave
a
cry
of
joy
the
hare
turned
in
his
tracks
and
jumped
aside
they
saw
him
dash
into
the
brushwood
head
over
heels
the
stirring
of
the
rumpled
leaves
vanished
away
like
a
ripple
on
the
face
of
waters
although
they
were
sorry
for
having
cried
out
the
adventure
filled
them
with
joy
they
rocked
with
laughter
as
they
thought
of
the
hare
terrified
leap
and
imitated
it
grotesquely
otto
did
the
same
then
they
chased
each
other
otto
was
the
hare
the
dog
they
plunged
through
woods
and
meadows
dashing
through
hedges
and
leaping
ditches
a
peasant
shouted
at
them
because
they
had
rushed
over
a
field
of
rye
they
did
not
stop
to
hear
him
imitated
the
hoarse
barking
of
the
dog
to
such
perfection
that
otto
laughed
until
he
cried
at
last
they
rolled
down
a
slope
shouting
like
mad
things
when
they
could
not
utter
another
sound
they
sat
up
and
looked
at
each
other
with
tears
of
laughter
in
their
eyes
they
were
quite
happy
and
pleased
with
themselves
they
were
no
longer
trying
to
play
the
heroic
friend
they
were
frankly
what
they
were
two
boys
they
came
back
singing
senseless
songs
and
yet
when
they
were
on
the
point
of
returning
to
the
town
they
thought
they
had
better
resume
their
pose
and
under
the
last
tree
of
the
woods
they
carved
their
initials
intertwined
but
then
good
temper
had
the
better
of
their
sentimentality
and
in
the
train
they
shouted
with
laughter
whenever
they
looked
at
each
other
they
parted
assuring
each
other
that
they
had
had
a
hugely
delightful
day
and
that
conviction
gained
with
them
when
they
were
alone
once
more
they
resumed
their
work
of
construction
more
patient
and
ingenious
even
than
that
of
the
bees
for
of
a
few
mediocre
scraps
of
memory
they
fashioned
a
marvelous
image
of
themselves
and
their
friendship
after
having
idealized
each
other
during
the
week
they
met
again
on
the
sunday
and
in
spite
of
the
discrepancy
between
the
truth
and
their
illusion
they
got
used
to
not
noticing
it
and
to
twisting
things
to
fit
in
with
their
desires
they
were
proud
of
being
friends
the
very
contrast
of
their
natures
brought
them
together
knew
nothing
so
beautiful
as
otto
his
fine
hands
his
lovely
hair
his
fresh
complexion
his
shy
speech
the
politeness
of
his
manners
and
his
scrupulous
care
of
his
appearance
delighted
him
otto
was
subjugated
by
brimming
strength
and
independence
accustomed
by
inheritance
to
religious
respect
for
all
authority
he
took
a
fearful
joy
in
the
company
of
a
comrade
in
whose
nature
was
so
little
reverence
for
the
established
order
of
things
he
had
a
little
voluptuous
thrill
of
terror
whenever
he
heard
him
decry
every
reputation
in
the
town
and
even
mimic
the
grand
duke
himself
knew
the
fascination
that
he
exercised
over
his
friend
and
used
to
exaggerate
his
aggressive
temper
like
some
old
revolutionary
he
hewed
away
at
social
conventions
and
the
laws
of
the
state
otto
would
listen
scandalized
and
delighted
he
used
timidly
to
try
and
join
in
but
he
was
always
careful
to
look
round
to
see
if
any
one
could
hear
never
failed
when
they
walked
together
to
leap
the
fences
of
a
field
whenever
he
saw
a
board
forbidding
it
or
he
would
pick
fruit
over
the
walls
of
private
grounds
otto
was
in
terror
lest
they
should
be
discovered
but
such
feelings
had
for
him
an
exquisite
savor
and
in
the
evening
when
he
had
returned
he
would
think
himself
a
hero
he
admired
fearfully
his
instinct
of
obedience
found
a
satisfying
quality
in
a
friendship
in
which
he
had
only
to
acquiesce
in
the
will
of
his
friend
never
put
him
to
the
trouble
of
coming
to
a
decision
he
decided
everything
decreed
the
doings
of
the
day
decreed
even
the
ordering
of
life
making
plans
which
admitted
of
no
discussion
for
otto
future
just
as
he
did
for
his
own
family
otto
fell
in
with
them
though
he
was
a
little
put
aback
by
hearing
dispose
of
his
fortune
for
the
building
later
on
of
a
theater
of
his
own
contriving
but
intimidated
by
his
friend
imperious
tones
he
did
not
protest
being
convinced
also
by
his
friend
conviction
that
the
money
amassed
by
oscar
diener
could
be
put
to
no
nobler
use
never
for
a
moment
had
any
idea
that
he
might
be
violating
otto
will
he
was
instinctively
a
despot
and
never
imagined
that
his
friend
wishes
might
be
different
from
his
own
had
otto
expressed
a
desire
different
from
his
own
he
would
not
have
hesitated
to
sacrifice
his
own
personal
preference
he
would
have
sacrificed
even
more
for
him
he
was
consumed
by
the
desire
to
run
some
risk
for
him
he
wished
passionately
that
there
might
appear
some
opportunity
of
putting
his
friendship
to
the
test
when
they
were
out
walking
he
used
to
hope
that
they
might
meet
some
danger
so
that
he
might
fling
himself
forward
to
face
it
he
would
have
loved
to
die
for
otto
meanwhile
he
watched
over
him
with
a
restless
solicitude
gave
him
his
hand
in
awkward
places
as
though
he
were
a
girl
he
was
afraid
that
he
might
be
tired
afraid
that
he
might
be
hot
afraid
that
he
might
be
cold
when
they
sat
down
under
a
tree
he
took
off
his
coat
to
put
it
about
his
friend
shoulders
when
they
walked
he
carried
his
cloak
he
would
have
carried
otto
himself
he
used
to
devour
him
with
his
eyes
like
a
lover
and
to
tell
the
truth
he
was
in
love
he
did
not
know
it
not
knowing
yet
what
love
was
but
sometimes
when
they
were
together
he
was
overtaken
by
a
strange
unease
the
same
that
had
choked
him
on
that
first
day
of
their
friendship
in
the
and
the
blood
would
rush
to
his
face
and
set
his
cheeks
aflame
he
was
afraid
by
an
instinctive
unanimity
the
two
boys
used
furtively
to
separate
and
run
away
from
each
other
and
one
would
lag
behind
on
the
road
they
would
pretend
to
be
busy
looking
for
blackberries
in
the
hedges
and
they
did
not
know
what
it
was
that
so
perturbed
them
but
it
was
in
their
letters
especially
that
their
feelings
flew
high
they
were
not
then
in
any
danger
of
being
contradicted
by
facts
and
nothing
could
check
their
illusions
or
intimidate
them
they
wrote
to
each
other
two
or
three
times
a
week
in
a
passionately
lyric
style
they
hardly
ever
spoke
of
real
happenings
or
common
things
they
raised
great
problems
in
an
apocalyptic
manner
which
passed
imperceptibly
from
enthusiasm
to
despair
they
called
each
other
my
blessing
my
hope
my
beloved
my
self
they
made
a
fearful
hash
of
the
word

they
painted
in
tragic
colors
the
sadness
of
their
lot
and
were
desolate
at
having
brought
into
the
existence
of
their
friend
the
sorrows
of
their
existence
i
am
sorry
my
love
wrote
for
the
pain
which
i
bring
you
i
can
not
bear
that
you
should
suffer

must
not
be
will
not
have
he
underlined
the
words
with
a
stroke
of
the
pen
that
dug
into
the
paper
if
you
suffer
where
shall
i
find
strength
to
live
i
have
no
happiness
but
in
you
oh

happy
i
will
gladly
take
all
the
burden
of
sorrow
upon
myself
think
of
me
love
me
i
have
such
great
need
of
being
loved
from
your
love
there
comes
to
me
a
warmth
which
gives
me
life
if
you
knew
how
i
shiver
there
is
winter
and
a
biting
wind
in
my
heart
i
embrace
your
soul
my
thought
kisses
yours
replied
otto
i
take
your
face
in
my
hands
was

and
what
i
have
not
done
and
will
not
do
with
my
lips
i
do
with
all
my
being
i
kiss
you
as

prudence
otto
pretended
to
doubt
him
do
you
love
me
as
much
as
i
love
you
o
god
wrote
not
as
much
but
ten
a
hundred
a
thousand
times
more
what
do
you
not
feel
it
what
would
you
have
me
do
to
stir
your
heart
what
a
lovely
friendship
is
ours
sighed
otto
was
there
ever
its
like
in
history
it
is
sweet
and
fresh
as
a
dream
if
only
it
does
not
pass
away
if
you
were
to
cease
to
love
me
how
stupid
you
are
my
beloved
replied
forgive
me
but
your
weakling
fear
enrages
me
how
can
you
ask
whether
i
shall
cease
to
love
you
for
me
to
live
is
to
love
you
death
is
powerless
against
my
love
you
yourself
could
do
nothing
if
you
wished
to
destroy
it
even
if
you
betrayed
me
even
if
you
rent
my
heart
i
should
die
with
a
blessing
upon
you
for
the
love
with
which
you
fill
me
once
for
all
then
do
not
be
uneasy
and
vex
me
no
more
with
these
cowardly
doubts
but
a
week
later
it
was
he
who
wrote
it
is
three
days
now
since
i
heard
a
word
fall
from
your
lips
i
tremble
would
you
forget
me
my
blood
freezes
at
the
thought
yes
doubtless
the
other
day
only
i
saw
your
coldness
towards
me
you
love
me
no
longer
you
are
thinking
of
leaving
me
listen
if
you
forget
me
if
you
ever
betray
me
i
will
kill
you
like
a
dog
you
do
me
wrong
my
dear
heart
groaned
otto
you
draw
tears
from
me
i
do
not
deserve
this
but
you
can
do
as
you
will
you
have
such
rights
over
me
that
if
you
were
to
break
my
soul
there
would
always
be
a
spark
left
to
live
and
love
you
always
heavenly
powers
cried
i
have
made
my
friend
weep
heap
insults
on
me
beat
me
trample
me
underfoot
i
am
a
wretch
i
do
not
deserve
your
love
they
had
special
ways
of
writing
the
address
on
their
letters
of
placing
the
stamp
upside
down
askew
at
bottom
in
a
corner
of
the
envelope
to
distinguish
their
letters
from
those
which
they
wrote
to
persons
who
did
not
matter
these
childish
secrets
had
the
charm
of
the
sweet
mysteries
of
love
one
day
as
he
was
returning
from
a
lesson
saw
otto
in
the
street
with
a
boy
of
his
own
age
they
were
laughing
and
talking
familiarly
went
pale
and
followed
them
with
his
eyes
until
they
had
disappeared
round
the
corner
of
the
street
they
had
not
seen
him
he
went
home
it
was
as
though
a
cloud
had
passed
over
the
sun
all
was
dark
when
they
met
on
the
following
sunday
said
nothing
at
first
but
after
they
had
been
walking
for
half
an
hour
he
said
in
a
choking
voice
i
saw
you
on
wednesday
in
the
ah
said
otto
and
he
blushed
went
on
you
were
not
alone
no
said
otto
i
was
with
some
one
swallowed
down
his
spittle
and
asked
in
a
voice
which
he
strove
to
make
careless
who
was
it
my
cousin
franz
ah
said
and
after
a
moment
you
have
never
said
anything
about
him
to
me
he
lives
at
rheinbach
do
you
see
him
often
he
comes
here
sometimes
and
you
do
you
go
and
stay
with
him
sometimes
ah
said
again
otto
who
was
not
sorry
to
turn
the
conversation
pointed
out
a
bird
who
was
pecking
at
a
tree
they
talked
of
other
things
ten
minutes
later
broke
out
again
are
you
friends
with
him
with
whom
asked
otto
he
knew
perfectly
who
was
meant
with
your
cousin
yes
why
oh
nothing
otto
did
not
like
his
cousin
much
for
he
used
to
bother
him
with
bad
jokes
but
a
strange
malign
instinct
made
him
add
a
few
moments
later
he
is
very
nice
who
asked
he
knew
quite
well
who
was
meant
franz
otto
waited
for
to
say
something
but
he
seemed
not
to
have
heard
he
was
cutting
a
switch
from
a
otto
went
on
he
is
amusing
he
has
all
sorts
of
stories
whistled
carelessly
otto
renewed
the
attack
and
he
is
so
clever
and
distinguished
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
though
to
say
what
interest
can
this
person
have
for
me
and
as
otto
piqued
began
to
go
on
he
brutally
cut
him
short
and
pointed
out
a
spot
to
which
to
run
they
did
not
touch
on
the
subject
again
the
whole
afternoon
but
they
were
frigid
affecting
an
exaggerated
politeness
which
was
unusual
for
them
especially
for
the
words
stuck
in
his
throat
at
last
he
could
contain
himself
no
longer
and
in
the
middle
of
the
road
he
turned
to
otto
who
was
lagging
five
yards
behind
he
took
him
fiercely
by
the
hands
and
let
loose
upon
him
listen
otto
i
will
not
i
will
not
let
you
be
so
friendly
with
franz
because
because
you
are
my
friend
and
i
will
not
let
you
love
any
one
more
than
me
i
will
not
you
see
you
are
everything
to
me
you
can
not
you
must
not
if
i
lost
you
there
would
be
nothing
left
but
death
i
do
not
know
what
i
should
do
i
should
kill
myself
i
should
kill
you
no
forgive
me
tears
fell
from
his
eyes
otto
moved
and
frightened
by
the
sincerity
of
such
grief
growling
out
threats
made
haste
to
swear
that
he
did
not
and
never
would
love
anybody
so
much
as
that
franz
was
nothing
to
him
and
that
he
would
not
see
him
again
if
wished
it
drank
in
his
words
and
his
heart
took
new
life
he
laughed
and
breathed
heavily
he
thanked
otto
effusively
he
was
ashamed
of
having
made
such
a
scene
but
he
was
relieved
of
a
great
weight
they
stood
face
to
face
and
looked
at
each
other
not
moving
and
holding
hands
they
were
very
happy
and
very
much
embarrassed
they
became
silent
then
they
began
to
talk
again
and
found
their
old
gaiety
they
felt
more
at
one
than
ever
but
it
was
not
the
last
scene
of
the
kind
now
that
otto
felt
his
power
over
he
was
tempted
to
abuse
it
he
knew
his
sore
spot
and
was
irresistibly
tempted
to
place
his
finger
on
it
not
that
he
had
any
pleasure
in
anger
on
the
contrary
it
made
him
unhappy
but
he
felt
his
power
by
making
suffer
he
was
not
bad
he
had
the
soul
of
a
girl
in
spite
of
his
promises
he
continued
to
appear
arm
in
arm
with
franz
or
some
other
comrade
they
made
a
great
noise
between
them
and
he
used
to
laugh
in
an
affected
way
when
reproached
him
with
it
he
used
to
titter
and
pretend
not
to
take
him
seriously
until
seeing
eyes
change
and
his
lips
tremble
with
anger
he
would
change
his
tone
and
fearfully
promise
not
to
do
it
again
and
the
next
day
he
would
do
it
would
write
him
furious
letters
in
which
he
called
him
scoundrel
let
me
never
hear
of
you
again
i
do
not
know
you
may
the
devil
take
you
and
all
dogs
of
your
kidney
but
a
tearful
word
from
otto
or
as
he
ever
did
the
sending
of
a
flower
as
a
token
of
his
eternal
constancy
was
enough
for
to
be
plunged
in
remorse
and
to
write
my
angel
i
am
mad
forget
my
idiocy
you
are
the
best
of
men
your
little
finger
alone
is
worth
more
than
all
stupid
you
have
the
treasures
of
an
ingenuous
and
delicate
tenderness
i
kiss
your
flower
with
tears
in
my
eyes
it
is
there
on
my
heart
i
thrust
it
into
my
skin
with
blows
of
my
fist
i
would
that
it
could
make
me
bleed
so
that
i
might
the
more
feel
your
exquisite
goodness
and
my
own
infamous
folly
but
they
began
to
weary
of
each
other
it
is
false
to
pretend
that
little
quarrels
feed
friendship
was
sore
against
otto
for
the
injustice
that
otto
made
him
be
guilty
of
he
tried
to
argue
with
himself
he
laid
the
blame
upon
his
own
despotic
temper
his
loyal
and
eager
nature
brought
for
the
first
time
to
the
test
of
love
gave
itself
utterly
and
demanded
a
gift
as
utter
without
the
reservation
of
one
particle
of
the
heart
he
admitted
no
sharing
in
friendship
being
ready
to
sacrifice
all
for
his
friend
he
thought
it
right
and
even
necessary
that
his
friend
should
wholly
sacrifice
himself
and
everything
for
him
but
he
was
beginning
to
feel
that
the
world
was
not
built
on
the
model
of
his
own
inflexible
character
and
that
he
was
asking
things
which
others
could
not
give
then
he
tried
to
submit
he
blamed
himself
he
regarded
himself
as
an
egoist
who
had
no
right
to
encroach
upon
the
liberty
of
his
friend
and
to
monopolize
his
affection
he
did
sincerely
endeavor
to
leave
him
free
whatever
it
might
cost
himself
in
a
spirit
of
humiliation
he
did
set
himself
to
pledge
otto
not
to
neglect
franz
he
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
he
was
glad
to
see
him
finding
pleasure
in
society
other
than
his
own
but
when
otto
who
was
not
deceived
maliciously
obeyed
him
he
could
not
help
lowering
at
him
and
then
he
broke
out
again
if
necessary
he
would
have
forgiven
otto
for
preferring
other
friends
to
himself
but
what
he
could
not
stomach
was
the
lie
otto
was
neither
liar
nor
hypocrite
but
it
was
as
difficult
for
him
to
tell
the
truth
as
for
a
stutterer
to
pronounce
words
what
he
said
was
never
altogether
true
nor
altogether
false
either
from
timidity
or
from
uncertainty
of
his
own
feelings
he
rarely
spoke
definitely
his
answers
were
equivocal
and
above
all
upon
every
occasion
he
made
mystery
and
was
secret
in
a
way
that
set
beside
himself
when
he
was
caught
tripping
or
was
caught
in
what
according
to
the
conventions
of
their
friendship
was
a
fault
instead
of
admitting
it
he
would
go
on
denying
it
and
telling
absurd
stories
one
day
exasperated
struck
him
he
thought
it
must
be
the
end
of
their
friendship
and
that
otto
would
never
forgive
him
but
after
sulking
for
a
few
hours
otto
came
back
as
though
nothing
had
happened
he
had
no
resentment
for
violence
perhaps
even
it
was
not
unpleasing
to
him
and
had
a
certain
charm
for
him
and
yet
he
resented
letting
himself
be
tricked
gulping
down
all
his
mendacities
he
despised
him
a
little
and
thought
himself
superior
for
his
part
resented
otto
receiving
blows
without
revolting
they
no
longer
saw
each
other
with
the
eyes
of
those
first
days
their
failings
showed
up
in
full
light
otto
found
independence
less
charming
was
a
tiresome
companion
when
they
went
walking
he
had
no
sort
of
concern
for
correctness
he
used
to
dress
as
he
liked
take
off
his
coat
open
his
waistcoat
walk
with
open
collar
roll
up
his
put
his
hat
on
the
end
of
his
stick
and
fling
out
his
chest
in
the
air
he
used
to
swing
his
arms
as
he
walked
whistle
and
sing
at
the
top
of
his
voice
he
used
to
be
red
in
the
face
sweaty
and
dusty
he
looked
like
a
peasant
returning
from
a
fair
the
aristocratic
otto
used
to
be
mortified
at
being
seen
in
his
company
when
he
saw
a
carriage
coming
he
used
to
contrive
to
lag
some
ten
paces
behind
and
to
look
as
though
he
were
walking
alone
was
no
less
embarrassing
company
when
he
began
to
talk
at
an
inn
or
in
a
when
they
were
returning
home
he
used
to
talk
loudly
and
say
anything
that
came
into
his
head
and
treat
otto
with
a
disgusting
familiarity
he
used
to
express
opinions
quite
recklessly
concerning
people
known
to
everybody
or
even
about
the
appearance
of
people
sitting
only
a
few
yards
away
from
him
or
he
would
enter
into
intimate
details
concerning
his
health
and
domestic
affairs
it
was
useless
for
otto
to
roll
his
eyes
and
to
make
signals
of
alarm
seemed
not
to
notice
them
and
no
more
controlled
himself
than
if
he
had
been
alone
otto
would
see
smiles
on
the
faces
of
his
neighbors
and
would
gladly
have
sunk
into
the
ground
he
thought
coarse
and
could
not
understand
how
he
could
ever
have
found
delight
in
him
what
was
most
serious
was
that
was
just
as
reckless
and
indifferent
concerning
all
the
hedges
fences
inclosures
walls
prohibitions
of
entry
threats
of
fines
of
all
sorts
and
everything
that
sought
to
confine
his
liberty
and
protect
the
sacred
rights
of
property
against
it
otto
lived
in
fear
from
moment
to
moment
and
all
his
protests
were
useless
grew
worse
out
of
bravado
one
day
when
with
otto
at
his
heels
was
walking
perfectly
at
home
across
a
private
wood
in
spite
of
or
because
of
the
walls
fortified
with
broken
bottles
which
they
had
had
to
clear
they
found
themselves
suddenly
face
to
face
with
a
gamekeeper
who
let
fire
a
volley
of
oaths
at
them
and
after
keeping
them
for
some
time
under
a
threat
of
legal
proceedings
packed
them
off
in
the
most
ignominious
fashion
otto
did
not
shine
under
this
ordeal
he
thought
that
he
was
already
in
jail
and
wept
stupidly
protesting
that
he
had
gone
in
by
accident
and
that
he
had
followed
without
knowing
whither
he
was
going
when
he
saw
that
he
was
safe
instead
of
being
glad
he
bitterly
reproached
he
complained
that
had
brought
him
into
trouble
quelled
him
with
a
look
and
called
him
there
was
a
quick
passage
of
words
otto
would
have
left
if
he
had
known
how
to
find
the
way
home
he
was
forced
to
follow
him
but
they
affected
to
pretend
that
they
were
not
together
a
storm
was
brewing
in
their
anger
they
had
not
seen
it
coming
the
baking
countryside
resounded
with
the
cries
of
insects
suddenly
all
was
still
they
only
grew
aware
of
the
silence
after
a
few
minutes
their
ears
buzzed
they
raised
their
eyes
the
sky
was
black
huge
heavy
livid
clouds
overcast
it
they
came
up
from
every
side
like
a
they
seemed
all
to
be
hastening
towards
an
invisible
point
drawn
by
a
gap
in
the
sky
otto
in
terror
dare
not
tell
his
fears
and
took
a
malignant
pleasure
in
pretending
not
to
notice
anything
but
without
saying
a
word
they
drew
nearer
together
they
were
alone
in
the
wide
country
silence
not
a
wind
stirred
hardly
a
fevered
tremor
that
made
the
little
leaves
of
the
trees
shiver
now
and
then
suddenly
a
whirling
wind
raised
the
dust
twisted
the
trees
and
lashed
them
furiously
and
the
silence
came
again
more
terrible
than
before
otto
in
a
trembling
voice
spoke
at
last
it
is
a
storm
we
must
go
home
said
let
us
go
home
but
it
was
too
late
a
blinding
savage
light
flashed
the
heavens
roared
the
vault
of
clouds
rumbled
in
a
moment
they
were
wrapped
about
by
the
hurricane
maddened
by
the
lightning
deafened
by
the
thunder
drenched
from
head
to
foot
they
were
in
deserted
country
half
an
hour
from
the
nearest
house
in
the
lashing
rain
in
the
dim
light
came
the
great
red
flashes
of
the
storm
they
tried
to
run
but
their
wet
clothes
clinging
they
could
hardly
walk
their
shoes
slipped
on
their
feet
the
water
trickled
down
their
bodies
it
was
difficult
to
breathe
otto
teeth
were
chattering
and
he
was
mad
with
rage
he
said
biting
things
to
he
wanted
to
stop
he
declared
that
it
was
dangerous
to
walk
he
threatened
to
sit
down
on
the
road
to
sleep
on
the
soil
in
the
middle
of
the
plowed
fields
made
no
reply
he
went
on
walking
blinded
by
the
wind
the
rain
and
the
lightning
deafened
by
the
noise
a
little
uneasy
but
unwilling
to
admit
it
and
suddenly
it
was
all
over
the
storm
had
passed
as
it
had
come
but
they
were
both
in
a
pitiful
condition
in
truth
was
as
usual
so
disheveled
that
a
little
more
disorder
made
hardly
any
difference
to
him
but
otto
so
neat
so
careful
of
his
appearance
cut
a
sorry
figure
it
was
as
though
he
had
just
taken
a
bath
in
his
clothes
and
turning
and
seeing
him
could
not
help
roaring
with
laughter
otto
was
so
exhausted
that
he
could
not
even
be
angry
took
pity
and
talked
gaily
to
him
otto
replied
with
a
look
of
fury
made
him
stop
at
a
farm
they
dried
themselves
before
a
great
fire
and
drank
hot
wine
thought
the
adventure
funny
and
tried
to
laugh
at
it
but
that
was
not
at
all
to
otto
taste
and
he
was
morose
and
silent
for
the
rest
of
their
walk
they
came
back
sulking
and
did
not
shake
hands
when
they
parted
as
a
result
of
this
prank
they
did
not
see
each
other
for
more
than
a
week
they
were
severe
in
their
judgment
of
each
other
but
after
inflicting
punishment
on
themselves
by
depriving
themselves
of
one
of
their
sunday
walks
they
got
so
bored
that
their
rancor
died
away
made
the
first
advances
as
usual
otto
condescended
to
meet
them
and
they
made
peace
in
spite
of
their
disagreement
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
do
without
each
other
they
had
many
faults
they
were
both
egoists
but
their
egoism
was
naïve
it
knew
not
the
of
maturity
which
makes
it
so
repulsive
it
knew
not
itself
even
it
was
almost
lovable
and
did
not
prevent
them
from
sincerely
loving
each
other
young
otto
used
to
weep
on
his
pillow
as
he
told
himself
stories
of
romantic
devotion
of
which
he
was
the
hero
lie
used
to
invent
pathetic
adventures
in
which
he
was
strong
valiant
intrepid
and
protected
whom
he
used
to
imagine
that
he
adored
never
saw
or
heard
anything
beautiful
or
strange
without
thinking
if
only
otto
were
here
he
carried
the
image
of
his
friend
into
his
whole
life
and
that
image
used
to
be
transfigured
and
become
so
gentle
that
in
spite
of
all
that
he
knew
about
otto
it
used
to
intoxicate
him
certain
words
of
otto
which
he
used
to
remember
long
after
they
were
spoken
and
to
embellish
by
the
way
used
to
make
him
tremble
with
emotion
they
imitated
each
other
otto
aped
manners
gestures
and
writing
was
sometimes
irritated
by
the
shadow
which
repeated
every
word
that
he
said
and
dished
up
his
thoughts
as
though
they
were
its
own
but
he
did
not
see
that
he
himself
was
imitating
otto
and
copying
his
way
of
dressing
walking
and
pronouncing
certain
words
they
were
under
a
fascination
they
were
infused
one
in
the
other
their
hearts
were
overflowing
with
tenderness
they
trickled
over
with
it
on
every
side
like
a
fountain
each
imagined
that
his
friend
was
the
cause
of
it
they
did
not
know
that
it
was
the
waking
of
their
adolescence
who
never
distrusted
any
one
used
to
leave
his
papers
lying
about
but
an
instinctive
modesty
made
him
keep
together
the
drafts
of
the
letters
which
he
scrawled
to
otto
and
the
replies
but
he
did
not
lock
them
up
he
just
placed
them
between
the
leaves
of
one
of
his
where
he
felt
certain
that
no
one
would
look
for
them
he
reckoned
without
his
brothers
malice
he
had
seen
them
for
some
time
laughing
and
whispering
and
looking
at
him
they
were
declaiming
to
each
other
fragments
of
speech
which
threw
them
into
wild
laughter
could
not
catch
the
words
and
following
his
usual
tactics
with
them
he
feigned
utter
indifference
to
everything
they
might
do
or
say
a
few
words
roused
his
attention
he
thought
he
recognized
them
soon
he
was
left
without
doubt
that
they
had
read
his
letters
but
when
he
challenged
ernest
and
rodolphe
who
were
calling
each
other
my
dear
soul
with
pretended
earnestness
he
could
get
nothing
from
them
the
little
wretches
pretended
not
to
understand
and
said
that
they
had
the
right
to
call
each
other
whatever
they
liked
who
had
found
all
the
letters
in
their
places
did
not
insist
farther
shortly
afterwards
he
caught
ernest
in
the
act
of
thieving
the
little
beast
was
rummaging
in
the
drawer
of
the
chest
in
which
louisa
kept
her
money
shook
him
and
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
tell
him
everything
that
he
had
stored
up
against
him
he
enumerated
in
terms
of
scant
courtesy
the
misdeeds
of
ernest
and
it
was
not
a
short
catalogue
ernest
took
the
lecture
in
bad
part
he
replied
impudently
that
had
nothing
to
reproach
him
with
and
he
hinted
at
unmentionable
things
in
his
brother
friendship
with
otto
did
not
understand
but
when
he
grasped
that
otto
was
being
dragged
into
the
quarrel
he
demanded
an
explanation
of
ernest
the
boy
tittered
then
when
he
saw
white
with
anger
he
refused
to
say
any
more
saw
that
he
would
obtain
nothing
in
that
way
he
sat
down
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
affected
a
profound
contempt
for
ernest
ernest
piqued
by
this
was
impudent
again
he
set
himself
to
hurt
his
brother
and
set
forth
a
litany
of
things
each
more
cruel
and
more
vile
than
the
last
kept
a
tight
hand
on
himself
when
at
last
he
did
understand
he
saw
red
he
leaped
from
his
chair
ernest
had
no
time
to
cry
out
had
hurled
himself
on
him
and
rolled
with
him
into
the
middle
of
the
room
and
beat
his
head
against
the
tiles
on
the
frightful
cries
of
the
victim
louisa
melchior
everybody
came
running
they
rescued
ernest
in
a
parlous
state
would
not
loose
his
prey
they
had
to
beat
and
beat
him
they
called
him
a
savage
beast
and
he
looked
it
his
eyes
were
bursting
from
his
head
he
was
grinding
his
teeth
and
his
only
thought
was
to
hurl
himself
again
on
ernest
when
they
asked
him
what
had
happened
his
fury
increased
and
he
cried
out
that
he
would
kill
him
ernest
also
refused
to
tell
could
not
eat
nor
sleep
he
was
shaking
with
fever
and
wept
in
his
bed
it
was
not
only
for
otto
that
he
was
suffering
a
revolution
was
taking
place
in
him
ernest
had
no
idea
of
the
hurt
that
he
had
been
able
to
do
his
brother
was
at
heart
of
a
puritanical
intolerance
which
could
not
admit
the
dark
ways
of
life
and
was
discovering
them
one
by
one
with
horror
at
fifteen
with
his
free
life
and
strong
instincts
he
remained
strangely
simple
his
natural
purity
and
ceaseless
toil
had
protected
him
his
brother
words
had
opened
up
abyss
on
abyss
before
him
never
would
he
have
conceived
such
infamies
and
now
that
the
idea
of
it
had
come
to
him
all
his
joy
in
loving
and
being
loved
was
spoiled
not
only
his
friendship
with
otto
but
friendship
itself
was
poisoned
it
was
much
worse
when
certain
sarcastic
allusions
made
him
think
perhaps
wrongly
that
he
was
the
object
of
the
unwholesome
curiosity
of
the
town
and
especially
when
some
time
afterwards
melchior
made
a
remark
about
his
walks
with
otto
probably
there
was
no
malice
in
melchior
but
on
the
watch
read
hidden
meanings
into
every
word
and
almost
he
thought
himself
guilty
at
the
same
time
otto
was
passing
through
a
similar
crisis
they
tried
still
to
see
each
other
in
secret
but
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
regain
the
carelessness
of
their
old
relation
their
frankness
was
spoiled
the
two
boys
who
loved
each
other
with
a
tenderness
so
fearful
that
they
had
never
dared
exchange
a
fraternal
kiss
and
had
imagined
that
there
could
be
no
greater
happiness
than
in
seeing
each
other
and
in
being
friends
and
sharing
each
other
dreams
now
felt
that
they
were
stained
and
spotted
by
the
suspicion
of
evil
minds
they
came
to
see
evil
even
in
the
most
innocent
acts
a
look
a
they
blushed
they
had
evil
thoughts
their
relation
became
intolerable
without
saying
anything
they
saw
each
other
less
often
they
tried
writing
to
each
other
but
they
set
a
watch
upon
their
expressions
their
letters
became
cold
and
insipid
they
grew
disheartened
excused
himself
on
the
ground
of
his
work
otto
on
the
ground
of
being
too
busy
and
their
correspondence
ceased
soon
afterwards
otto
left
for
the
university
and
the
friendship
which
had
lightened
a
few
months
of
their
lives
died
down
and
out
and
also
a
new
love
of
which
this
had
been
only
the
forerunner
took
possession
of
heart
and
made
every
other
light
seem
pale
by
its
side
iii
minna
four
or
five
months
before
these
events
frau
josephs
von
kerich
widow
of
councilor
stephan
von
kerich
had
left
berlin
where
her
husband
duties
had
hitherto
detained
them
and
settled
down
with
her
daughter
in
the
little
rhine
town
in
her
native
country
she
had
an
old
house
with
a
large
garden
almost
a
park
which
sloped
down
to
the
river
not
far
from
home
from
his
attic
could
see
the
heavy
branches
of
the
trees
hanging
over
the
walls
and
the
high
peak
of
the
red
roof
with
its
mossy
tiles
a
little
sloping
alley
with
hardly
room
to
pass
ran
alongside
the
park
to
the
right
from
there
by
climbing
a
post
you
could
look
over
the
wall
did
not
fail
to
make
use
of
it
he
could
then
see
the
grassy
avenues
the
lawns
like
open
meadows
the
trees
interlacing
and
growing
wild
and
the
white
front
of
the
house
with
its
shutters
obstinately
closed
once
or
twice
a
year
a
gardener
made
the
rounds
and
aired
the
house
but
soon
nature
resumed
her
sway
over
the
garden
and
silence
reigned
over
all
that
silence
impressed
he
used
often
stealthily
to
climb
up
to
his
and
as
he
grew
taller
his
eyes
then
his
nose
then
his
mouth
reached
up
to
the
top
of
the
wall
now
he
could
put
his
arms
over
it
if
he
stood
on
tiptoe
and
in
spite
of
the
discomfort
of
that
position
he
used
to
stay
so
with
his
chin
on
the
wall
looking
listening
while
the
evening
unfolded
over
the
lawns
its
soft
waves
of
gold
which
lit
up
with
bluish
rays
the
shade
of
the
pines
there
he
could
forget
himself
until
he
heard
footsteps
approaching
in
the
street
the
night
scattered
its
scents
over
the
garden
lilac
in
spring
acacia
in
summer
dead
leaves
in
the
autumn
when
was
on
his
way
home
in
the
evening
from
the
palace
however
weary
he
might
be
he
used
to
stand
by
the
door
to
drink
in
the
delicious
scent
and
it
was
hard
for
him
to
go
back
to
the
smells
of
his
room
and
often
he
had
played
when
he
used
to
play
in
the
little
square
with
its
tufts
of
grass
between
the
stones
before
the
gateway
of
the
house
of
the
kerichs
on
each
side
of
the
gate
grew
a
a
hundred
years
old
his
grandfather
used
to
come
and
sit
beneath
them
and
smoke
his
pipe
and
the
children
used
to
use
the
nuts
for
missiles
and
toys
one
morning
as
he
went
up
the
alley
he
climbed
up
the
post
as
usual
he
was
thinking
of
other
things
and
looked
absently
he
was
just
going
to
climb
down
when
he
felt
that
there
was
something
unusual
about
it
he
looked
towards
the
house
the
windows
were
open
the
sun
was
shining
into
them
and
although
no
one
was
to
be
seen
the
old
place
seemed
to
have
been
roused
from
its
fifteen
years
sleep
and
to
be
smiling
in
its
awakening
went
home
uneasy
in
his
mind
at
dinner
his
father
talked
of
what
was
the
topic
of
the
neighborhood
the
arrival
of
frau
kerich
and
her
daughter
with
an
incredible
quantity
of
luggage
the
chestnut
square
was
filled
with
rascals
who
had
turned
up
to
help
unload
the
carts
was
excited
by
the
news
which
in
his
limited
life
was
an
important
event
and
he
returned
to
his
work
trying
to
imagine
the
inhabitants
of
the
enchanted
house
from
his
story
as
usual
hyperbolical
then
he
became
absorbed
in
his
work
and
had
forgotten
the
whole
affair
when
just
as
he
was
about
to
go
home
in
the
evening
he
remembered
it
all
and
he
was
impelled
by
curiosity
to
climb
his
to
spy
out
what
might
be
toward
within
the
walls
he
saw
nothing
but
the
quiet
avenue
in
which
the
motionless
trees
seemed
to
be
sleeping
in
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
in
a
few
moments
he
had
forgotten
why
he
was
looking
and
abandoned
himself
as
he
always
did
to
the
sweetness
of
the
silence
that
strange
place
standing
erect
perilously
balanced
on
the
top
of
a
post
was
meet
for
dreams
coming
from
the
ugly
alley
stuffy
and
dark
the
sunny
gardens
were
of
a
magical
radiance
his
spirit
wandered
freely
through
these
regions
of
harmony
and
music
sang
in
him
they
lulled
him
and
he
forgot
time
and
material
things
and
was
only
concerned
to
miss
none
of
the
whisperings
of
his
heart
so
he
dreamed
and
and
he
could
not
have
told
how
long
he
had
been
dreaming
for
he
saw
nothing
suddenly
his
heart
leaped
in
front
of
him
at
a
bend
in
an
avenue
were
two
women
faces
looking
at
him
one
a
young
lady
in
black
with
fine
irregular
features
and
fair
hair
tail
elegant
with
carelessness
and
indifference
in
the
poise
of
her
head
was
looking
at
him
with
kind
laughing
eyes
the
other
a
girl
of
fifteen
also
in
deep
mourning
looked
as
though
she
were
going
to
burst
out
into
a
fit
of
wild
laughter
she
was
standing
a
little
behind
her
mother
who
without
looking
at
her
signed
to
her
to
be
quiet
she
covered
her
lips
with
her
hands
as
if
she
were
hard
put
to
it
not
to
burst
out
laughing
she
was
a
little
creature
with
a
fresh
face
white
pink
and
she
had
a
plump
little
nose
a
plump
little
mouth
a
plump
little
chin
firm
eyebrows
bright
eyes
and
a
mass
of
fair
hair
plaited
and
wound
round
her
head
in
a
crown
to
show
her
rounded
neck
and
her
smooth
white
forehead
a
cranach
face
was
turned
to
stone
by
this
apparition
he
could
not
go
away
but
stayed
glued
to
his
post
with
his
mouth
wide
open
it
was
only
when
he
saw
the
young
lady
coming
towards
him
with
her
kindly
mocking
smile
that
he
wrenched
himself
away
and
jumped
tumbled
down
into
the
alley
dragging
with
him
pieces
of
plaster
from
the
wall
he
heard
a
kind
voice
calling
him
little
boy
and
a
shout
of
childish
laughter
clear
and
liquid
as
the
song
of
a
bird
he
found
himself
in
the
alley
on
hands
and
knees
and
after
a
moment
bewilderment
he
ran
away
as
hard
as
he
could
go
as
though
he
was
afraid
of
being
pursued
he
was
ashamed
and
his
shame
kept
bursting
upon
him
again
when
he
was
alone
in
his
room
at
home
after
that
he
dared
not
go
down
the
alley
fearing
oddly
that
they
might
be
lying
in
wait
for
him
when
he
had
to
go
by
the
house
he
kept
close
to
the
walls
lowered
his
head
and
almost
ran
without
ever
looking
back
at
the
same
time
he
never
ceased
to
think
of
the
two
faces
that
he
had
seen
he
used
to
go
up
to
the
attic
taking
off
his
shoes
so
as
not
to
be
heard
and
to
look
his
hardest
out
through
the
skylight
in
the
direction
of
the
kerichs
house
and
park
although
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
it
was
impossible
to
see
anything
but
the
tops
of
the
trees
and
the
topmost
chimneys
about
a
month
later
at
one
of
the
weekly
concerts
of
the
musik
he
was
playing
a
concerto
for
piano
and
orchestra
of
his
own
composition
he
had
reached
the
last
movement
when
he
chanced
to
see
in
the
box
facing
him
frau
and
fräulein
kerich
looking
at
him
he
so
little
expected
to
see
them
that
he
was
astounded
and
almost
missed
out
his
reply
to
the
orchestra
he
went
on
playing
mechanically
to
the
end
of
the
piece
when
it
was
finished
he
saw
although
he
was
not
looking
in
their
direction
that
frau
and
fräulein
kerich
were
applauding
a
little
exaggeratedly
as
though
they
wished
him
to
see
that
they
were
applauding
he
hurried
away
from
the
stage
as
he
was
leaving
the
theater
he
saw
frau
kerich
in
the
lobby
separated
from
him
by
several
rows
of
people
and
she
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
him
to
pass
it
was
impossible
for
him
not
to
see
her
but
he
pretended
not
to
do
so
and
brushing
his
way
through
he
left
hurriedly
by
the
of
the
theater
then
he
was
angry
with
himself
for
he
knew
quite
well
that
frau
kerich
meant
no
harm
but
he
knew
that
in
the
same
situation
he
would
do
the
same
again
he
was
in
terror
of
meeting
her
in
the
street
whenever
he
saw
at
a
distance
a
figure
that
resembled
her
he
used
to
turn
aside
and
take
another
road
it
was
she
who
came
to
him
she
sought
him
out
at
home
one
morning
when
he
came
back
to
dinner
louisa
proudly
told
him
that
a
lackey
in
breeches
and
livery
had
left
a
letter
for
him
and
she
gave
him
a
large
envelope
on
the
back
of
which
was
engraved
the
kerich
arms
opened
it
and
trembled
as
he
read
these
words
frau
josepha
von
kerich
requests
the
pleasure
of
krafft
company
at
tea
at
five
i
shall
not
go
declared
what
cried
louisa
i
said
that
you
would
go
made
a
scene
and
reproached
his
mother
with
meddling
in
affairs
that
were
no
concern
of
hers
the
servant
waited
for
a
reply
i
said
that
you
were
free
you
have
nothing
to
do
then
in
vain
did
lose
his
temper
and
swear
that
he
would
not
go
he
could
not
get
out
of
it
now
when
the
appointed
time
came
he
got
ready
fuming
in
his
heart
of
hearts
he
was
not
sorry
that
chance
had
so
done
violence
to
his
whims
frau
von
kerich
had
had
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
in
the
pianist
at
the
concert
the
little
savage
whose
shaggy
head
had
appeared
over
her
garden
wall
on
the
day
of
her
arrival
she
had
made
inquiries
about
him
of
her
neighbors
and
what
she
learned
about
family
and
the
boy
brave
and
difficult
life
had
roused
interest
in
him
and
a
desire
to
talk
to
him
trussed
up
in
an
absurd
coat
which
made
him
look
like
a
country
parson
arrived
at
the
house
quite
ill
with
shyness
he
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
frau
and
fräulein
kerich
had
had
no
time
to
remark
his
features
on
the
day
when
they
had
first
seen
him
a
servant
led
him
down
a
long
corridor
thickly
carpeted
so
that
his
footsteps
made
no
sound
to
a
room
with
a
door
which
opened
on
to
the
garden
it
was
raining
a
little
and
cold
a
good
fire
was
burning
in
the
fireplace
near
the
window
through
which
he
had
a
peep
of
the
wet
trees
in
the
mist
the
two
ladies
were
sitting
frau
kerich
was
working
and
her
daughter
was
reading
a
book
when
entered
when
they
saw
him
they
exchanged
a
sly
look
they
know
me
again
thought
abashed
he
bobbed
awkwardly
and
went
on
bobbing
frau
von
kerich
smiled
cheerfully
and
held
out
her
hand
my
dear
neighbor
she
said
i
am
glad
to
see
you
since
i
heard
you
at
the
concert
i
have
been
wanting
to
tell
you
how
much
pleasure
you
gave
me
and
as
the
only
way
of
telling
you
was
to
invite
you
here
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
for
having
done
so
in
the
kindly
conventional
words
of
welcome
there
was
so
much
cordiality
in
spite
of
a
hidden
sting
of
irony
that
grew
more
at
his
ease
they
do
not
know
me
again
he
thought
comforted
frau
von
kerich
presented
her
daughter
who
had
closed
her
book
and
was
looking
interestedly
at
my
daughter
minna
she
said
she
wanted
so
much
to
see
you
but
mamma
said
minna
it
is
not
the
first
time
that
we
have
seen
each
other
and
she
laughed
aloud
they
do
know
me
again
thought
crestfallen
true
said
frau
von
kerich
laughing
too
you
paid
us
a
visit
the
day
we
came
at
these
words
the
girl
laughed
again
and
looked
so
pitiful
that
when
minna
looked
at
him
she
laughed
more
than
ever
she
could
not
control
herself
and
she
laughed
until
she
cried
frau
von
kerich
tried
to
stop
her
but
she
too
could
not
help
laughing
and
in
spite
of
his
constraint
fell
victim
to
the
contagiousness
of
it
their
merriment
was
irresistible
it
was
impossible
to
take
offense
at
it
but
lost
countenance
altogether
when
minna
caught
her
breath
again
and
asked
him
whatever
he
could
be
doing
on
the
wall
she
was
tickled
by
his
uneasiness
he
murmured
altogether
at
a
loss
frau
von
kerich
came
to
his
aid
and
turned
the
conversation
by
pouring
out
tea
she
questioned
him
amiably
about
his
life
but
he
did
not
gain
confidence
he
could
not
sit
down
he
could
not
hold
his
cup
which
threatened
to
upset
and
whenever
they
offered
him
water
milk
sugar
or
cakes
he
thought
that
he
had
to
get
up
hurriedly
and
bow
his
thanks
stiff
trussed
up
in
his
collar
and
tie
like
a
tortoise
in
its
shell
not
daring
and
not
being
able
to
turn
his
head
to
right
or
left
and
overwhelmed
by
frau
von
kerich
innumerable
questions
and
the
warmth
of
her
manner
frozen
by
minna
looks
which
he
felt
were
taking
in
his
features
his
hands
his
movements
his
clothes
they
made
him
even
more
uncomfortable
by
trying
to
put
him
at
his
ease
frau
von
kerich
by
her
flow
of
words
minna
by
the
coquettish
eyes
which
instinctively
she
made
at
him
to
amuse
herself
finally
they
gave
up
trying
to
get
anything
more
from
him
than
bows
and
monosyllables
and
frau
von
kerich
who
had
the
whole
burden
of
the
conversation
asked
him
when
she
was
worn
out
to
play
the
piano
much
more
shy
of
them
than
of
a
concert
audience
he
played
an
adagio
of
mozart
but
his
very
shyness
the
uneasiness
which
was
beginning
to
fill
his
heart
from
the
company
of
the
two
women
the
ingenuous
emotion
with
which
his
bosom
swelled
which
made
him
happy
and
unhappy
were
in
tune
with
the
tenderness
and
youthful
modesty
of
the
music
and
gave
it
the
charm
of
spring
frau
von
kerich
was
moved
by
it
she
said
so
with
the
exaggerated
words
of
praise
customary
among
men
and
women
of
the
world
she
was
none
the
less
sincere
for
that
and
the
very
excess
of
the
flattery
was
sweet
coming
from
such
charming
lips
naughty
minna
said
nothing
and
looked
astonished
at
the
boy
who
was
so
stupid
when
he
talked
but
was
so
eloquent
with
his
fingers
felt
their
sympathy
and
grew
bold
under
it
he
went
on
playing
then
half
turning
towards
minna
with
an
awkward
smile
and
without
raising
his
eyes
he
said
timidly
this
is
what
i
was
doing
on
the
wall
he
played
a
little
piece
in
which
he
had
in
fact
developed
the
musical
ideas
which
had
come
to
him
in
his
favorite
spot
as
he
looked
into
the
garden
not
be
it
said
on
the
evening
when
he
had
seen
minna
and
frau
von
kerich
for
some
obscure
reason
known
only
to
his
heart
he
was
trying
to
persuade
himself
that
it
was
so
but
long
before
and
in
the
calm
rhythm
of
the
con
there
were
to
be
found
the
serene
impression
of
the
singing
of
birds
mutterings
of
beasts
and
the
majestic
slumber
of
the
great
trees
in
the
peace
of
the
sunset
the
two
hearers
listened
delightedly
when
he
had
finished
frau
von
kerich
rose
took
his
hands
with
her
usual
vivacity
and
thanked
him
effusively
minna
clapped
her
hands
and
cried
that
it
was
admirable
and
that
to
make
him
compose
other
works
as
sublime
as
that
she
would
have
a
ladder
placed
against
the
wall
so
that
he
might
work
there
at
his
case
frau
von
kerich
told
not
to
listen
to
silly
minna
she
begged
him
to
come
as
often
as
he
liked
to
her
garden
since
he
loved
it
and
she
added
that
he
need
never
bother
to
call
on
them
if
he
found
it
tiresome
you
need
never
bother
to
come
and
see
us
added
minna
only
if
you
do
not
come
beware
she
wagged
her
finger
in
menace
minna
was
possessed
by
no
imperious
desire
that
should
come
to
see
her
or
should
even
follow
the
rules
of
politeness
with
regard
to
herself
but
it
pleased
her
to
produce
a
little
effect
which
instinctively
she
felt
to
be
charming
blushed
delightedly
frau
von
kerich
won
him
completely
by
the
tact
with
which
she
spoke
of
his
mother
and
grandfather
whom
she
had
known
the
warmth
and
kindness
of
the
two
ladies
touched
his
heart
he
exaggerated
their
easy
urbanity
their
worldly
graciousness
in
his
desire
to
think
it
heartfelt
and
deep
he
began
to
tell
them
with
his
naïve
trustfulness
of
his
plans
and
his
wretchedness
he
did
not
notice
that
more
than
an
hour
had
passed
and
he
jumped
with
surprise
when
a
servant
came
and
announced
dinner
but
his
confusion
turned
to
happiness
when
frau
von
kerich
told
him
to
stay
and
dine
with
them
like
the
good
friends
that
they
were
going
to
be
and
were
already
a
place
was
laid
for
him
between
the
mother
and
daughter
and
at
table
his
talents
did
not
show
to
such
advantage
as
at
the
piano
that
part
of
his
education
had
been
much
neglected
it
was
his
impression
that
eating
and
drinking
were
the
essential
things
at
table
and
not
the
manner
of
them
and
so
tidy
minna
looked
at
him
pouting
and
a
little
horrified
they
thought
that
he
would
go
immediately
after
supper
but
he
followed
them
into
the
little
room
and
sat
with
them
and
had
no
idea
of
going
minna
stifled
her
yawns
and
made
signs
to
her
mother
he
did
not
notice
them
because
he
was
dumb
with
his
happiness
and
thought
they
were
like
himself
because
minna
when
she
looked
at
him
made
eyes
at
him
from
habit
and
finally
once
he
was
seated
he
did
not
quite
know
how
to
get
up
and
take
his
leave
he
would
have
stayed
all
night
had
not
frau
von
kerich
sent
him
away
herself
without
ceremony
but
kindly
he
went
carrying
in
his
heart
the
soft
light
of
the
brown
eyes
of
frau
von
kerich
and
the
blue
eyes
of
minna
on
his
hands
he
felt
the
sweet
contact
of
soft
fingers
soft
as
flowers
and
a
subtle
perfume
which
he
had
never
before
breathed
enveloped
him
bewildered
him
brought
him
almost
to
swooning
he
went
again
two
days
later
as
was
arranged
to
give
minna
a
thereafter
under
this
arrangement
he
went
regularly
twice
a
week
in
the
morning
and
very
often
he
went
again
in
the
evening
to
play
and
talk
frau
von
kerich
was
glad
to
see
him
she
was
a
clever
and
a
kind
woman
she
was
when
she
lost
her
husband
and
although
young
in
body
and
at
heart
she
was
not
sorry
to
withdraw
from
the
world
in
which
she
had
gone
far
since
her
marriage
perhaps
she
left
it
the
more
easily
because
she
had
found
it
very
amusing
and
thought
wisely
that
she
could
not
both
eat
her
cake
and
have
it
she
was
devoted
to
the
memory
of
herr
von
kerich
not
that
she
had
felt
anything
like
love
for
him
when
they
married
but
was
enough
for
her
she
was
of
an
easy
temper
and
an
affectionate
disposition
she
had
given
herself
up
to
her
daughter
education
but
the
same
moderation
which
she
had
had
in
her
love
held
in
check
the
impulsive
and
morbid
quality
which
is
sometimes
in
motherhood
when
the
child
is
the
only
creature
upon
whom
the
woman
can
expend
her
jealous
need
of
loving
and
being
loved
she
loved
minna
much
but
was
clear
in
her
judgment
of
her
and
did
not
conceal
any
of
her
imperfections
any
more
than
she
tried
to
deceive
herself
about
herself
witty
and
clever
she
had
a
keen
eye
for
discovering
at
a
glance
the
weakness
and
ridiculous
side
of
any
person
she
took
great
pleasure
in
it
without
ever
being
the
least
malicious
for
she
was
as
indulgent
as
she
was
scoffing
and
while
she
laughed
at
people
she
loved
to
be
of
use
to
them
young
gave
food
both
to
her
kindness
and
to
her
critical
mind
during
the
first
days
of
her
sojourn
in
the
little
town
when
her
mourning
kept
her
out
of
society
was
a
distraction
for
her
primarily
by
his
talent
she
loved
music
although
she
was
no
musician
she
found
in
it
a
physical
and
moral
in
which
thoughts
could
idly
sink
into
a
pleasant
melancholy
sitting
by
the
fire
while
played
a
book
in
her
hands
and
smiling
vaguely
she
took
a
silent
delight
in
the
mechanical
movements
of
his
fingers
and
the
purposeless
wanderings
of
her
reverie
hovering
among
the
sad
sweet
images
of
the
past
but
more
even
than
the
music
the
musician
interested
her
she
was
clever
enough
to
be
conscious
of
rare
gifts
although
she
was
not
capable
of
perceiving
his
really
original
quality
it
gave
her
a
curious
pleasure
to
watch
the
waking
of
those
mysterious
fires
which
she
saw
kindling
in
him
she
had
quickly
appreciated
his
moral
qualities
his
uprightness
his
courage
the
sort
of
stoicism
in
him
so
touching
in
a
child
but
for
all
that
she
did
mot
view
him
the
less
with
the
usual
perspicacity
of
her
sharp
mocking
eyes
his
awkwardness
his
ugliness
his
little
ridiculous
qualities
amused
her
she
did
not
take
him
altogether
seriously
she
did
not
take
many
things
seriously
antic
outbursts
his
violence
his
fantastic
humor
made
her
think
sometimes
that
he
was
a
little
unbalanced
she
saw
in
him
one
of
the
kraffts
honest
men
and
good
musicians
but
always
a
little
wrong
in
the
head
her
light
irony
escaped
he
was
conscious
only
of
frau
von
kindness
he
was
so
unused
to
any
one
being
kind
to
him
although
his
duties
at
the
palace
brought
him
into
daily
contact
with
the
world
poor
had
remained
a
little
savage
untutored
and
uneducated
the
selfishness
of
the
court
was
only
concerned
in
turning
him
to
its
profit
and
not
in
helping
him
in
any
way
he
went
to
the
palace
sat
at
the
piano
played
and
went
away
again
and
nobody
ever
took
the
trouble
to
talk
to
him
except
absently
to
pay
him
some
banal
compliment
since
his
grandfather
death
no
one
either
at
home
or
outside
had
ever
thought
of
helping
him
to
learn
the
conduct
of
life
or
to
be
a
man
he
suffered
cruelly
from
his
ignorance
and
the
roughness
of
his
manners
he
went
through
an
agony
and
bloody
sweat
to
shape
himself
alone
but
he
did
not
succeed
books
conversation
example
all
were
lacking
he
would
fain
have
confessed
his
distress
to
a
friend
but
could
not
bring
himself
to
do
so
even
with
otto
he
had
not
dared
because
at
the
first
words
he
had
uttered
otto
had
assumed
a
tone
of
disdainful
superiority
which
had
burned
into
him
like
hot
iron
and
now
with
frau
von
kerich
it
all
became
easy
of
her
own
accord
without
his
having
to
ask
anything
it
cost
pride
so
much
she
showed
him
gently
what
he
should
not
do
told
him
what
he
ought
to
do
advised
him
how
to
dress
eat
walk
talk
and
never
passed
over
any
fault
of
manners
taste
or
language
and
he
could
not
be
hurt
by
it
so
light
and
careful
was
her
touch
in
the
handling
of
the
boy
easily
injured
vanity
she
took
in
hand
also
his
literary
education
without
seeming
to
be
concerned
with
it
she
never
showed
surprise
at
his
strange
ignorance
but
never
let
slip
an
opportunity
of
correcting
his
mistakes
simply
easily
as
if
it
were
natural
for
him
to
have
been
in
error
and
instead
of
alarming
him
with
pedantic
lessons
she
conceived
the
idea
of
employing
their
evening
meetings
by
making
minna
or
read
passages
of
history
or
of
the
poets
german
and
foreign
she
treated
him
as
a
son
of
the
house
with
a
few
fine
shades
of
patronizing
familiarity
which
he
never
saw
she
was
even
concerned
with
his
clothes
gave
him
new
ones
knitted
him
a
woolen
comforter
presented
him
with
little
toilet
things
and
all
so
gently
that
he
never
was
put
about
by
her
care
or
her
presents
in
short
she
gave
him
all
the
little
attentions
and
the
care
which
come
to
every
good
woman
instinctively
for
a
child
who
is
intrusted
to
her
or
trusts
himself
to
her
without
her
having
any
deep
feeling
for
it
but
thought
that
all
the
tenderness
was
given
to
him
personally
and
he
was
filled
with
gratitude
he
would
break
out
into
little
awkward
passionate
speeches
which
seemed
a
little
ridiculous
to
frau
von
kerich
though
they
did
not
fail
to
give
her
pleasure
with
minna
his
relation
was
very
different
when
met
her
again
at
her
first
lesson
he
was
still
intoxicated
by
his
memories
of
the
preceding
evening
and
of
the
girl
soft
looks
and
he
was
greatly
surprised
to
find
her
an
altogether
different
person
from
the
girl
he
had
seen
only
a
few
hours
before
she
hardly
looked
at
him
and
did
not
listen
to
what
he
said
and
when
she
raised
her
eyes
to
him
he
saw
in
them
so
icy
a
coldness
that
he
was
chilled
by
it
he
tortured
himself
for
a
long
time
to
discover
wherein
lay
his
offense
he
had
given
none
and
feelings
were
neither
more
nor
less
favorable
than
on
the
preceding
day
just
as
she
had
been
then
minna
was
completely
indifferent
to
him
if
on
the
first
occasion
she
had
smiled
upon
him
in
welcome
it
was
from
a
instinctive
coquetry
who
delights
to
try
the
power
of
her
eyes
on
the
first
comer
be
it
only
a
trimmed
poodle
who
turns
up
to
fill
her
idle
hours
but
since
the
preceding
day
the
conquest
had
already
lost
interest
for
her
she
had
subjected
to
a
severe
scrutiny
and
she
thought
him
an
ugly
boy
poor
who
played
the
piano
well
though
he
had
ugly
hands
held
his
fork
at
table
abominably
and
ate
his
fish
with
a
knife
then
he
seemed
to
her
very
uninteresting
she
wanted
to
have
from
him
she
wanted
even
to
amuse
herself
with
him
because
for
the
moment
she
had
no
other
companion
and
because
in
spite
of
her
pretensions
of
being
no
longer
a
child
she
had
still
in
gusts
a
crazy
longing
to
play
a
need
of
expending
her
superfluous
gaiety
which
was
in
her
as
in
her
mother
still
further
roused
by
the
constraint
imposed
by
their
mourning
but
she
took
no
more
account
of
than
of
a
domestic
animal
and
if
it
still
happened
occasionally
during
the
days
of
her
greatest
coldness
that
she
made
eyes
at
him
it
was
purely
out
of
forgetfulness
and
because
she
was
thinking
of
something
else
or
simply
so
as
not
to
get
out
of
practice
and
when
she
looked
at
him
like
that
heart
used
to
leap
it
is
doubtful
if
she
saw
it
she
was
telling
herself
stories
for
she
was
at
the
age
when
we
delight
the
senses
with
sweet
fluttering
dreams
she
was
forever
absorbed
in
thoughts
of
love
filled
with
a
curiosity
which
was
only
innocent
from
ignorance
and
she
only
thought
of
love
as
a
young
lady
should
in
terms
of
marriage
her
ideal
was
far
from
having
taken
definite
shape
sometimes
she
dreamed
of
marrying
a
lieutenant
sometimes
of
marrying
a
poet
properly
sublime
schiller
one
project
devoured
another
and
the
last
was
always
welcomed
with
the
same
gravity
and
just
the
same
amount
of
conviction
for
the
rest
all
of
them
were
quite
ready
to
give
way
before
a
profitable
reality
for
it
is
wonderful
to
see
how
easily
romantic
girls
forget
their
dreams
when
something
less
ideal
but
more
certain
appears
before
them
as
it
was
sentimental
minna
was
in
spite
of
all
calm
and
cold
in
spite
of
her
aristocratic
name
and
the
pride
with
which
the
ennobling
particle
filled
her
she
had
the
soul
of
a
little
german
housewife
in
the
exquisite
days
of
adolescence
naturally
did
not
in
the
least
understand
the
complicated
mechanism
more
complicated
in
appearance
than
in
reality
of
the
feminine
heart
he
was
often
baffled
by
the
ways
of
his
friends
but
he
was
so
happy
in
loving
them
that
he
credited
them
with
all
that
disturbed
and
made
him
sad
with
them
so
as
to
persuade
himself
that
he
was
as
much
loved
by
them
as
he
loved
them
himself
a
word
or
an
affectionate
look
plunged
him
in
delight
sometimes
he
was
so
bowled
over
by
it
that
he
would
burst
into
tears
sitting
by
the
table
in
the
quiet
little
room
with
frau
von
kerich
a
few
yards
away
sewing
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
minna
reading
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
and
no
one
talking
he
looking
through
the
at
the
gravel
of
the
avenue
glistening
under
the
moon
a
soft
murmur
coming
from
the
tops
of
the
trees
his
heart
would
be
so
full
of
happiness
that
suddenly
for
no
reason
he
would
leap
from
his
chair
throw
himself
at
frau
von
kerich
feet
seize
her
hand
needle
or
no
needle
cover
it
with
kisses
press
it
to
his
lips
his
cheeks
his
eyes
and
sob
minna
would
raise
her
eyes
lightly
shrug
her
shoulders
and
make
a
face
frau
von
kerich
would
smile
down
at
the
big
boy
groveling
at
her
feet
and
pat
his
head
with
her
free
hand
and
say
to
him
in
her
pretty
voice
affectionately
and
ironically
well
well
old
fellow
what
is
it
oh
the
sweetness
of
that
voice
that
peace
that
silence
that
soft
air
in
which
were
no
shouts
no
roughness
no
violence
that
oasis
in
the
harsh
desert
of
life
and
heroic
light
gilding
with
its
rays
people
and
things
the
light
of
the
enchanted
world
conjured
up
by
the
reading
of
the
divine
poets
goethe
schiller
shakespeare
springs
of
strength
of
sorrow
and
of
love
minna
with
her
head
down
over
the
book
and
her
face
faintly
colored
by
her
animated
delivery
would
read
in
her
fresh
voice
with
its
slight
lisp
and
try
to
sound
important
when
she
spoke
in
the
characters
of
warriors
and
kings
sometimes
frau
von
kerich
herself
would
take
the
book
then
she
would
lend
to
tragic
histories
the
spiritual
and
tender
graciousness
of
her
own
nature
but
most
often
she
would
listen
lying
back
in
her
chair
her
needlework
in
her
lap
she
would
smile
at
her
own
thoughts
for
always
she
would
come
back
to
them
through
every
book
also
had
tried
to
read
but
he
had
had
to
give
it
up
he
stammered
stumbled
over
the
words
skipped
the
punctuation
seemed
to
understand
nothing
and
would
be
so
moved
that
he
would
have
to
stop
in
the
middle
of
the
pathetic
passages
feeling
tears
coming
then
in
a
tantrum
he
would
throw
the
book
down
on
the
table
and
his
two
friends
would
burst
out
laughing
how
he
loved
them
he
carried
the
image
of
them
everywhere
with
him
and
they
were
mingled
with
the
persons
in
shakespeare
and
goethe
he
could
hardly
distinguish
between
them
some
fragrant
word
of
the
poets
which
called
up
from
the
depths
of
his
being
passionate
emotions
could
not
in
him
be
severed
from
the
beloved
lips
that
had
made
him
hear
it
for
the
first
time
even
twenty
years
later
he
could
never
read
egmont
or
romeo
or
see
them
played
without
there
leaping
up
in
him
at
certain
lines
the
memory
of
those
quiet
evenings
those
dreams
of
happiness
and
the
beloved
faces
of
frau
von
kerich
and
minna
he
would
spend
hours
looking
at
them
in
the
evening
when
they
were
reading
in
the
night
when
he
was
dreaming
in
his
bed
awake
with
his
eyes
closed
during
the
day
when
he
was
dreaming
at
his
place
in
the
orchestra
playing
mechanically
with
his
eyes
half
closed
he
had
the
most
innocent
tenderness
for
them
and
knowing
nothing
of
love
he
thought
he
was
in
love
but
he
did
not
quite
know
whether
it
was
with
the
mother
or
the
daughter
he
went
into
the
matter
gravely
and
did
not
know
which
to
choose
and
yet
as
it
seemed
to
him
he
must
at
all
costs
make
his
choice
he
inclined
towards
frau
von
kerich
and
he
did
in
fact
discover
as
soon
as
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
it
that
it
was
she
that
he
loved
he
loved
her
quick
eyes
the
absent
smile
upon
her
lips
her
pretty
forehead
so
young
in
seeming
and
the
parting
to
one
side
in
her
fine
soft
hair
her
rather
husky
voice
with
its
little
cough
her
motherly
hands
the
elegance
of
her
movements
and
her
mysterious
soul
he
would
thrill
with
happiness
when
sitting
by
his
side
she
would
kindly
explain
to
him
the
meaning
of
some
passage
in
a
book
which
he
did
not
understand
she
would
lay
her
hand
on
shoulder
he
would
feel
the
warmth
of
her
fingers
her
breath
on
his
cheek
the
sweet
perfume
of
her
body
he
would
listen
in
ecstasy
lose
all
thought
of
the
book
and
understand
nothing
at
all
she
would
see
that
and
ask
him
to
repeat
what
she
had
said
then
he
would
say
nothing
and
she
would
laughingly
be
angry
and
tap
his
nose
with
her
book
telling
him
that
he
would
always
be
a
little
donkey
to
that
he
would
reply
that
he
did
not
care
so
long
as
he
was
little
donkey
and
she
did
not
drive
him
out
of
her
house
she
would
pretend
to
make
objections
then
she
would
say
that
although
he
was
an
ugly
little
donkey
and
very
stupid
she
would
agree
to
keep
him
and
perhaps
even
to
love
him
although
he
was
good
for
nothing
if
at
the
least
he
would
be
just
then
they
would
both
laugh
and
he
would
go
swimming
in
his
joy
when
he
discovered
that
he
loved
frau
von
kerich
broke
away
from
minna
he
was
beginning
to
be
irritated
by
her
coldness
and
disdain
and
as
by
dint
of
seeing
her
often
he
had
been
emboldened
little
by
little
to
resume
his
freedom
of
manner
with
her
he
did
not
conceal
his
exasperation
from
her
she
loved
to
sting
him
and
he
would
reply
sharply
they
were
always
saying
unkind
things
to
each
other
and
frau
von
kerich
only
laughed
at
them
who
never
got
the
better
in
such
passages
of
words
used
sometimes
to
issue
from
them
so
infuriated
that
he
thought
he
detested
minna
and
he
persuaded
himself
that
he
only
went
to
her
house
again
because
of
frau
von
kerich
he
went
on
giving
her
music
lessons
twice
a
week
from
nine
to
ten
in
the
morning
he
superintended
the
girl
scales
and
exercises
the
room
in
which
they
did
this
was
minna
studio
an
odd
workroom
which
with
an
amusing
fidelity
reflected
the
singular
disorder
of
her
little
feminine
mind
on
the
table
were
little
figures
of
musical
cats
a
whole
orchestra
one
playing
a
violin
another
the
violoncello
a
little
toilet
things
and
writing
things
tidily
arranged
on
the
shelves
were
tiny
busts
of
musicians
beethoven
frowning
wagner
with
his
velvet
cap
and
the
apollo
belvedere
on
the
mantelpiece
by
a
frog
smoking
a
red
pipe
a
paper
fan
on
which
was
painted
the
bayreuth
theater
on
the
two
bookshelves
were
a
few
books
lübke
mommsen
schiller
sans
famille
jules
verne
montaigne
on
the
walls
large
photographs
of
the
sistine
madonna
and
pictures
by
herkomer
edged
with
blue
and
green
ribbons
there
was
also
a
view
of
a
swiss
hotel
in
a
frame
of
silver
thistles
and
above
all
everywhere
in
profusion
in
every
corner
of
the
room
photographs
of
officers
tenors
conductors
all
with
inscriptions
almost
all
with
verse
or
at
least
what
is
accepted
as
verse
in
germany
in
the
center
of
the
room
on
a
marble
pillar
was
enthroned
a
bust
of
brahms
with
a
beard
and
above
the
piano
little
plush
monkeys
and
cotillion
trophies
hung
by
threads
minna
would
arrive
late
her
eyes
still
puffy
with
sleep
sulky
she
would
hardly
reach
out
her
hand
to
coldly
bid
him
and
without
a
word
gravely
and
with
dignity
sit
down
at
the
piano
when
she
was
alone
it
pleased
her
to
play
interminable
scales
for
that
allowed
her
agreeably
to
prolong
her
condition
and
the
dreams
which
she
was
spinning
for
herself
but
would
compel
her
to
fix
her
attention
on
difficult
exercises
and
so
sometimes
she
would
avenge
herself
by
playing
them
as
badly
as
she
could
she
was
a
fair
musician
but
she
did
not
like
music
like
many
german
women
but
like
them
she
thought
she
ought
to
like
it
and
she
took
her
lessons
conscientiously
enough
except
for
certain
moments
of
diabolical
malice
indulged
in
to
enrage
her
master
she
could
enrage
him
much
more
by
the
icy
indifference
with
which
she
set
herself
to
her
task
but
the
worst
was
when
she
took
it
into
her
head
that
it
was
her
duty
to
throw
her
soul
into
an
expressive
passage
then
she
would
become
sentimental
and
feel
nothing
young
sitting
by
her
side
was
not
very
polite
he
never
paid
her
compliments
far
from
it
she
resented
that
and
never
let
any
remark
pass
without
answering
it
she
would
argue
about
everything
that
he
said
and
when
she
made
a
mistake
she
would
insist
that
she
was
playing
what
was
written
he
would
get
cross
and
they
would
go
on
exchanging
ungracious
words
and
impertinences
with
her
eyes
on
the
keys
she
never
ceased
to
watch
and
enjoy
his
fury
as
a
relief
from
boredom
she
would
invent
stupid
little
tricks
with
no
other
object
than
to
interrupt
the
lesson
and
to
annoy
she
would
pretend
to
choke
so
as
to
make
herself
interesting
she
would
have
a
fit
of
coughing
or
she
would
have
something
very
important
to
say
to
the
maid
knew
that
she
was
and
minna
knew
that
knew
that
she
was
and
it
amused
her
for
could
not
tell
her
what
he
was
thinking
one
day
when
she
was
indulging
in
this
amusement
and
was
coughing
languidly
hiding
her
mouth
in
her
handkerchief
as
if
she
were
on
the
point
of
choking
but
in
reality
watching
exasperation
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
she
conceived
the
ingenious
idea
of
letting
the
handkerchief
fall
so
as
to
make
pick
it
up
which
he
did
with
the
worst
grace
in
the
world
she
rewarded
him
with
a
thank
you
in
her
grand
manner
which
nearly
made
him
explode
she
thought
the
game
too
good
not
to
be
repeated
next
day
she
did
it
again
did
not
budge
he
was
boiling
with
rage
she
waited
a
moment
and
then
said
in
an
injured
tone
will
you
please
pick
up
my
handkerchief
could
not
contain
himself
i
am
not
your
servant
he
cried
roughly
pick
it
up
yourself
minna
choked
with
rage
she
got
up
suddenly
from
her
stool
which
fell
over
oh
this
is
too
much
she
said
and
angrily
thumped
the
piano
and
she
left
the
room
in
a
fury
waited
she
did
not
come
back
he
was
ashamed
of
what
he
had
done
he
felt
that
he
had
behaved
like
a
little
cad
and
he
was
at
the
end
of
his
tether
she
made
fun
of
him
too
impudently
he
was
afraid
lest
minna
should
complain
to
her
mother
and
he
should
be
forever
banished
from
frau
von
kerich
thoughts
he
knew
not
what
to
do
for
if
he
was
sorry
for
his
brutality
no
power
on
earth
would
have
made
him
ask
pardon
he
came
again
on
the
chance
the
next
day
although
he
thought
that
minna
would
refuse
to
take
her
lesson
but
minna
who
was
too
proud
to
complain
to
anybody
minna
whose
conscience
was
not
shielded
against
reproach
appeared
again
after
making
him
wait
five
minutes
more
than
usual
and
she
sat
down
at
the
piano
stiff
upright
without
turning
her
head
or
saying
a
word
as
though
no
longer
existed
for
her
but
she
did
not
fail
to
take
her
lesson
and
all
the
subsequent
lessons
because
she
knew
very
well
that
was
a
fine
musician
and
that
she
ought
to
learn
to
play
the
piano
properly
if
she
wished
to
be
what
she
wished
to
be
a
young
lady
of
finished
education
but
how
bored
she
was
how
they
bored
each
other
one
misty
morning
in
march
when
little
flakes
of
snow
were
flying
like
feathers
in
the
gray
air
they
were
in
the
studio
it
was
hardly
daylight
minna
was
arguing
as
usual
about
a
false
note
that
she
had
struck
and
pretending
that
it
was
written
so
although
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
she
was
lying
bent
over
the
book
to
look
at
the
passage
in
question
closely
her
hand
was
on
the
rack
and
she
did
not
move
it
his
lips
were
near
her
hand
he
tried
to
read
and
could
not
he
was
looking
at
something
else
a
thing
soft
transparent
like
the
petals
of
a
flower
suddenly
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
thinking
of
he
pressed
his
lips
as
hard
as
he
could
on
the
little
hand
they
were
both
dumfounded
by
it
he
flung
backwards
she
withdrew
her
hand
both
blushing
they
said
no
word
they
did
not
look
at
each
other
after
a
moment
of
confused
silence
she
began
to
play
again
she
was
very
uneasy
her
bosom
rose
and
fell
as
though
she
were
under
some
weight
she
struck
wrong
note
after
wrong
note
he
did
not
notice
it
he
was
more
uneasy
than
she
his
temples
throbbed
he
heard
nothing
he
knew
not
what
she
was
playing
and
to
break
the
silence
he
made
a
few
random
remarks
in
a
choking
voice
he
thought
that
he
was
forever
lost
in
minna
opinion
he
was
confounded
by
what
he
had
done
thought
it
stupid
and
rude
the
over
he
left
minna
without
looking
at
her
and
even
forgot
to
say
she
did
not
mind
she
had
no
thought
now
of
deeming
and
if
she
made
so
many
mistakes
in
playing
it
was
because
all
the
time
she
was
watching
him
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
with
astonishment
and
curiosity
and
for
the
first
time
sympathy
when
she
was
left
alone
instead
of
going
to
look
for
her
mother
as
usual
she
shut
herself
up
in
her
room
and
examined
this
extraordinary
event
she
sat
with
her
face
in
her
hands
in
front
of
the
mirror
her
eyes
seemed
to
her
soft
and
gleaming
she
bit
gently
at
her
lip
in
the
effort
of
thinking
and
as
she
looked
complacently
at
her
pretty
face
she
visualized
the
scene
and
blushed
and
smiled
at
dinner
she
was
animated
and
merry
she
refused
to
go
out
at
once
and
stayed
in
the
for
part
of
the
afternoon
she
had
some
work
in
her
hand
and
did
not
make
ten
stitches
without
a
mistake
but
what
did
that
matter
in
a
corner
of
the
room
with
her
back
turned
to
her
mother
she
smiled
or
under
a
sudden
impulse
to
let
herself
go
she
pranced
about
the
room
and
sang
at
the
top
of
her
voice
frau
von
kerich
started
and
called
her
mad
minna
flung
her
arms
round
her
neck
shaking
with
laughter
and
hugged
and
kissed
her
in
the
evening
when
she
went
to
her
room
it
was
a
long
time
before
she
went
to
bed
she
went
on
looking
at
herself
in
the
mirror
trying
to
remember
and
having
thought
all
through
the
day
of
the
same
thing
thinking
of
nothing
she
undressed
slowly
she
stopped
every
moment
sitting
on
the
bed
trying
to
remember
what
was
like
it
was
a
of
fantasy
who
appeared
and
now
he
did
not
seem
nearly
so
uncouth
to
her
she
went
to
bed
and
put
out
the
light
ten
minutes
later
the
scene
of
the
morning
rushed
back
into
her
mind
and
she
burst
out
laughing
her
mother
got
up
softly
and
opened
the
door
thinking
that
against
orders
she
was
reading
in
bed
she
found
minna
lying
quietly
in
her
bed
with
her
eyes
wide
open
in
the
dim
candlelight
what
is
it
she
asked
what
is
amusing
you
nothing
said
minna
gravely
i
was
thinking
you
are
very
lucky
to
find
your
own
company
so
amusing
but
go
to
sleep
yes
mamma
replied
minna
meekly
inside
herself
she
was
grumbling
go
away
do
go
away
until
the
door
was
closed
and
she
could
go
on
enjoying
her
dreams
she
fell
into
a
sweet
drowsiness
when
she
was
nearly
asleep
she
leaped
for
joy
he
loves
me
what
happiness
how
good
of
him
to
love
me
how
i
love
him
she
kissed
her
pillow
and
went
fast
asleep
when
next
they
were
together
was
surprised
at
amiability
she
gave
him
and
asked
him
how
he
was
in
a
very
soft
voice
she
sat
at
the
piano
looking
wise
and
modest
she
was
an
angel
of
docility
there
were
none
of
her
naughty
schoolgirl
tricks
but
she
listened
religiously
to
remarks
acknowledged
that
they
were
right
gave
little
timid
cries
herself
when
she
made
a
mistake
and
set
herself
to
be
more
accurate
could
not
understand
it
in
a
very
short
time
she
made
astounding
progress
not
only
did
she
play
better
but
with
musical
feeling
little
as
he
was
given
to
flattery
he
had
to
pay
her
a
compliment
she
blushed
with
pleasure
and
thanked
him
for
it
with
a
look
tearful
with
gratitude
she
took
pains
with
her
toilet
for
him
she
wore
ribbons
of
an
exquisite
shade
she
gave
little
smiles
and
soft
glances
which
he
disliked
for
they
irritated
him
and
moved
him
to
the
depths
of
his
soul
and
now
it
was
she
who
made
conversation
but
there
was
nothing
childish
in
what
she
said
she
talked
gravely
and
quoted
the
poets
in
a
pedantic
and
pretentious
way
he
hardly
ever
replied
he
was
ill
at
ease
this
new
minna
that
he
did
not
know
astonished
and
disquieted
him
always
she
watched
him
she
was
waiting
for
what
did
she
know
herself
she
was
waiting
for
him
to
do
it
again
he
took
good
care
not
to
for
he
was
convinced
that
he
had
behaved
like
a
clod
he
seemed
never
to
give
a
thought
to
it
she
grew
restless
and
one
day
when
he
was
sitting
quietly
at
a
respectful
distance
from
her
dangerous
little
paws
she
was
seized
with
impatience
with
a
movement
so
quick
that
she
had
no
time
to
think
of
it
she
herself
thrust
her
little
hand
against
his
lips
he
was
staggered
by
it
then
furious
and
ashamed
but
none
the
less
he
kissed
it
very
passionately
her
naïve
effrontery
enraged
him
he
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
her
there
and
then
but
he
could
not
he
was
entrapped
whirling
thoughts
rushed
in
his
mind
he
could
make
nothing
of
them
like
mists
ascending
from
a
valley
they
rose
from
the
depths
of
his
heart
he
wandered
hither
and
thither
at
random
through
this
mist
of
love
and
whatever
he
did
he
did
but
turn
round
and
round
an
obscure
fixed
idea
a
desire
unknown
terrible
and
fascinating
as
a
flame
to
an
insect
it
was
the
sudden
eruption
of
the
blind
forces
of
nature
they
passed
through
a
period
of
waiting
they
watched
each
other
desired
each
other
were
fearful
of
each
other
they
were
uneasy
but
they
did
not
for
that
desist
from
their
little
hostilities
and
sulkinesses
only
there
were
no
more
familiarities
between
them
they
were
silent
each
was
busy
constructing
their
love
in
silence
love
has
curious
retroactive
effects
as
soon
as
discovered
that
he
loved
minna
he
discovered
at
the
same
time
that
he
had
always
loved
her
for
three
months
they
had
been
seeing
each
other
almost
every
day
without
ever
suspecting
the
existence
of
their
love
but
from
the
day
when
he
did
actually
love
her
he
was
absolutely
convinced
that
he
had
loved
her
from
all
eternity
it
was
a
good
thing
for
him
to
have
discovered
at
last
he
loved
he
had
loved
for
so
long
without
knowing
whom
it
was
a
sort
of
relief
to
him
like
a
sick
man
who
suffering
from
a
general
illness
vague
and
enervating
sees
it
become
definite
in
sharp
pain
in
some
portion
of
his
body
nothing
is
more
wearing
than
love
without
a
definite
object
it
eats
away
and
saps
the
strength
like
a
fever
a
known
passion
leads
the
mind
to
excess
that
is
exhausting
but
at
least
one
knows
why
it
is
an
excess
it
is
not
a
wasting
away
anything
rather
than
emptiness
although
minna
had
given
good
reason
to
believe
that
she
was
not
indifferent
to
him
he
did
not
fail
to
torture
himself
with
the
idea
that
she
despised
him
they
had
never
had
any
very
clear
idea
of
each
other
but
this
idea
had
never
been
more
confused
and
false
than
it
was
now
it
consisted
of
a
series
of
strange
fantasies
which
could
never
be
made
to
agree
for
they
passed
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
endowing
each
other
in
turn
with
faults
and
charms
which
they
did
not
possess
charms
when
they
were
parted
faults
when
they
were
together
in
either
case
they
were
wide
of
the
mark
they
did
not
know
themselves
what
they
desired
for
his
love
took
shape
as
that
thirst
for
tenderness
imperious
absolute
demanding
reciprocation
which
had
burned
in
him
since
childhood
which
he
demanded
from
others
and
wished
to
impose
on
them
by
will
or
force
sometimes
this
despotic
desire
of
full
sacrifice
of
himself
and
others
especially
others
perhaps
was
mingled
with
gusts
of
a
brutal
and
obscure
desire
which
set
him
whirling
and
he
did
not
understand
it
minna
curious
above
all
things
and
delighted
to
have
a
romance
tried
to
extract
as
much
pleasure
as
possible
from
it
for
her
vanity
and
sentimentality
she
tricked
herself
as
to
what
she
was
feeling
a
great
part
of
their
love
was
purely
literary
they
fed
on
the
books
they
had
read
and
were
forever
ascribing
to
themselves
feelings
which
they
did
not
possess
but
the
moment
was
to
come
when
all
these
little
lies
and
small
egoisms
were
to
vanish
away
before
the
divine
light
of
love
a
day
an
hour
a
few
seconds
of
eternity
and
it
was
so
unexpected
one
evening
they
were
alone
and
talking
the
room
was
growing
dark
their
conversation
took
a
serious
turn
they
talked
of
the
infinite
of
life
and
death
it
made
a
larger
frame
for
their
little
passion
minna
complained
of
her
loneliness
which
led
naturally
to
answer
that
she
was
not
so
lonely
as
she
thought
no
she
said
shaking
her
head
that
is
only
words
every
one
lives
for
himself
no
one
is
interested
in
you
nobody
loves
you
silence
and
i
said
suddenly
pale
with
emotion
impulsive
minna
jumped
to
her
feet
and
took
his
hands
the
door
opened
they
flung
apart
frau
von
kerich
entered
buried
himself
in
a
book
which
he
held
upside
down
minna
bent
over
her
work
and
pricked
her
finger
with
her
needle
they
were
not
alone
together
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
and
they
were
afraid
of
being
left
when
frau
von
kerich
got
up
to
look
for
something
in
the
next
room
minna
not
usually
obliging
ran
to
fetch
it
for
her
and
took
advantage
of
her
absence
to
take
his
leave
without
saying
goodnight
to
her
next
day
they
met
again
impatient
to
resume
their
interrupted
conversation
they
did
not
succeed
yet
circumstances
were
favorable
to
them
they
went
a
walk
with
frau
von
kerich
and
had
plenty
of
opportunity
for
talking
as
much
as
they
liked
but
could
not
speak
and
he
was
so
unhappy
that
he
stayed
as
far
away
as
possible
from
minna
and
she
pretended
not
to
notice
his
discourtesy
but
she
was
piqued
by
it
and
showed
it
when
did
at
last
contrive
to
utter
a
few
words
she
listened
icily
he
had
hardly
the
courage
to
finish
his
sentence
they
were
coming
to
the
end
of
the
walk
time
was
flying
and
he
was
wretched
at
not
having
been
able
to
make
use
of
it
a
week
passed
they
thought
they
had
mistaken
their
feeling
for
each
other
they
were
not
sure
but
that
they
had
dreamed
the
scene
of
that
evening
minna
was
resentful
against
was
afraid
of
meeting
her
alone
they
were
colder
to
each
other
than
ever
a
day
came
when
it
had
rained
all
morning
and
part
of
the
afternoon
they
had
stayed
in
the
house
without
speaking
reading
yawning
looking
out
of
the
window
they
were
bored
and
cross
about
four
the
sky
cleared
they
ran
into
the
garden
they
leaned
their
elbows
on
the
terrace
wall
and
looked
down
at
the
lawns
sloping
to
the
river
the
earth
was
steaming
a
soft
mist
was
ascending
to
the
sun
little
glittered
on
the
grass
the
smell
of
the
damp
earth
and
the
perfume
of
the
flowers
intermingled
around
them
buzzed
a
golden
swarm
of
bees
they
were
side
by
side
not
looking
at
each
other
they
could
not
bring
themselves
to
break
the
silence
a
bee
came
up
and
clung
awkwardly
to
a
clump
of
wistaria
heavy
with
rain
and
sent
a
shower
of
water
down
on
them
they
both
laughed
and
at
once
they
felt
that
they
were
no
longer
cross
with
each
other
and
were
friends
again
but
still
they
did
not
look
at
each
other
suddenly
without
turning
her
head
she
took
his
hand
and
said
come
she
led
him
quickly
to
the
little
labyrinth
with
its
paths
which
was
in
the
middle
of
the
grove
they
climbed
up
the
slope
slipping
on
the
soaking
ground
and
the
wet
trees
shook
out
their
branches
over
them
near
the
top
she
stopped
to
breathe
wait
wait
she
said
in
a
low
voice
trying
to
take
breath
he
looked
at
her
she
was
looking
away
she
was
smiling
breathing
hard
with
her
lips
parted
her
hand
was
trembling
in
they
felt
the
blood
throbbing
in
their
linked
hands
and
their
trembling
fingers
around
them
all
was
silent
the
pale
shoots
of
the
trees
were
quivering
in
the
sun
a
gentle
rain
dropped
from
the
leaves
with
silvery
sounds
and
in
the
sky
were
the
shrill
cries
of
swallows
she
turned
her
head
towards
him
it
was
a
lightning
flash
she
flung
her
arms
about
his
neck
he
flung
himself
into
her
arms
minna
minna
my
darling
i
love
you
jean
christophe
i
love
you
they
sat
on
a
wet
wooden
seat
they
were
filled
with
love
sweet
profound
absurd
everything
else
had
vanished
no
more
egoism
no
more
vanity
no
more
reservation
love
love
that
is
what
their
laughing
tearful
eyes
were
saying
the
cold
coquette
of
a
girl
the
proud
boy
were
devoured
with
the
need
of
of
giving
of
suffering
of
dying
for
each
other
they
did
not
know
each
other
they
were
not
the
same
everything
was
changed
their
hearts
their
faces
their
eyes
gave
out
a
radiance
of
the
most
touching
kindness
and
tenderness
moments
of
purity
of
of
absolute
giving
of
themselves
which
through
life
will
never
return
after
a
desperate
murmuring
of
words
and
passionate
promises
to
belong
to
each
other
forever
after
kisses
and
incoherent
words
of
delight
they
saw
that
it
was
late
and
they
ran
back
hand
in
hand
almost
falling
in
the
narrow
paths
bumping
into
trees
feeling
nothing
blind
and
drunk
with
the
joy
of
it
when
he
left
her
he
did
not
go
home
he
could
not
have
gone
to
sleep
he
left
the
town
and
walked
over
the
fields
he
walked
blindly
through
the
night
the
air
was
fresh
the
country
dark
and
deserted
a
hooted
shrilly
went
on
like
a
the
little
lights
of
the
town
quivered
on
the
plain
and
the
stars
in
the
dark
sky
he
sat
on
a
wall
by
the
road
and
suddenly
burst
into
tears
he
did
not
know
why
he
was
too
happy
and
the
excess
of
his
joy
was
compounded
of
sadness
and
delight
there
was
in
it
thankfulness
for
his
happiness
pity
for
those
who
were
not
happy
a
melancholy
and
sweet
feeling
of
the
frailty
of
things
the
mad
joy
of
living
he
wept
for
delight
and
slept
in
the
midst
of
his
tears
when
he
awoke
dawn
was
peeping
white
mists
floated
over
the
river
and
veiled
the
town
where
minna
worn
out
was
sleeping
while
in
her
heart
was
the
light
of
her
smile
of
happiness
they
contrived
to
meet
again
in
the
garden
next
morning
and
told
their
love
once
more
but
now
the
divine
unconsciousness
of
it
all
was
gone
she
was
a
little
playing
the
part
of
the
girl
in
love
and
he
though
more
sincere
was
also
playing
a
part
they
talked
of
what
their
life
should
be
he
regretted
his
poverty
and
humble
estate
she
affected
to
be
generous
and
enjoyed
her
generosity
she
said
that
she
cared
nothing
for
money
that
was
true
for
she
knew
nothing
about
it
having
never
known
the
lack
of
it
he
promised
that
he
would
become
a
great
artist
that
she
thought
fine
and
amusing
like
a
novel
she
thought
it
her
duty
to
behave
really
like
a
woman
in
love
she
read
poetry
she
was
sentimental
he
was
touched
by
the
infection
he
took
pains
with
his
dress
he
was
absurd
he
set
a
guard
upon
his
speech
he
was
pretentious
frau
von
kerich
watched
him
and
laughed
and
asked
herself
what
could
have
made
him
so
stupid
but
they
had
moments
of
marvelous
poetry
and
these
would
suddenly
burst
upon
them
out
of
dull
days
like
sunshine
through
a
mist
a
look
a
gesture
a
meaningless
word
and
they
were
bathed
in
happiness
they
had
their
in
the
evening
on
the
stairs
and
their
eyes
would
seek
each
other
divine
each
other
through
the
half
darkness
and
the
thrill
of
their
hands
as
they
touched
the
trembling
in
their
voices
all
those
little
nothings
that
fed
their
memory
at
night
as
they
slept
so
lightly
that
the
chiming
of
each
hour
would
awake
them
and
their
hearts
would
sing
i
am
loved
like
the
murmuring
of
a
stream
they
discovered
the
charm
of
things
spring
smiled
with
a
marvelous
sweetness
the
heavens
were
brilliant
the
air
was
soft
as
they
had
never
been
before
all
the
town
the
red
roofs
the
old
walls
the
cobbled
streets
showed
with
a
kindly
charm
that
moved
at
night
when
everybody
was
asleep
minna
would
get
up
from
her
bed
and
stand
by
the
window
drowsy
and
feverish
and
in
the
afternoon
when
he
was
not
there
she
would
sit
in
a
swing
and
dream
with
a
book
on
her
knees
her
eyes
half
closed
sleepy
and
lazily
happy
mind
and
body
hovering
in
the
spring
air
she
would
spend
hours
at
the
piano
with
a
patience
exasperating
to
others
going
over
and
over
again
scales
and
passages
which
made
her
turn
pale
and
cold
with
emotion
she
would
weep
when
she
heard
schumann
music
she
felt
full
of
pity
and
kindness
for
all
creatures
and
so
did
he
they
would
give
money
stealthily
to
poor
people
whom
they
met
in
the
street
and
would
then
exchange
glances
of
compassion
they
were
happy
in
their
kindness
to
tell
the
truth
they
were
kind
only
by
fits
and
starts
minna
suddenly
discovered
how
sad
was
the
humble
life
of
devotion
of
old
frida
who
had
been
a
servant
in
the
house
since
her
mother
childhood
and
at
once
she
ran
and
hugged
her
to
the
great
astonishment
of
the
good
old
creature
who
was
busy
mending
the
linen
in
the
kitchen
but
that
did
not
keep
her
from
speaking
harshly
to
her
a
few
hours
later
when
frida
did
not
come
at
once
on
the
sound
of
the
bell
and
who
was
consumed
with
love
for
all
humanity
and
would
turn
aside
so
as
not
to
crush
an
insect
was
entirely
indifferent
to
his
own
family
by
a
strange
reaction
he
was
colder
and
more
curt
with
them
the
more
affectionate
he
was
to
all
other
creatures
he
hardly
gave
thought
to
them
he
spoke
abruptly
to
them
and
found
no
interest
in
seeing
them
both
in
and
minna
their
kindness
was
only
a
surfeit
of
tenderness
which
overflowed
at
intervals
to
the
benefit
of
the
first
comer
except
for
these
overflowings
they
were
more
egoistic
than
ever
for
their
minds
were
filled
only
with
the
one
thought
and
everything
was
brought
back
to
that
how
much
of
life
was
filled
with
the
girl
face
what
emotion
was
in
him
when
he
saw
her
white
frock
in
the
distance
when
he
was
looking
for
her
in
the
garden
when
at
the
theater
sitting
a
few
yards
away
from
their
empty
places
he
heard
the
door
of
their
box
open
and
the
mocking
voice
that
he
knew
so
well
when
in
some
outside
conversation
the
dear
name
of
kerich
cropped
up
he
would
go
pale
and
blush
for
a
moment
or
two
he
would
see
and
hear
nothing
and
then
there
would
be
a
rush
of
blood
over
all
his
body
the
assault
of
unknown
forces
the
little
german
girl
naïve
and
sensual
had
odd
little
tricks
she
would
place
her
ring
on
a
little
pile
of
flour
and
he
would
have
to
get
it
again
and
again
with
his
teeth
without
whitening
his
nose
or
she
would
pass
a
thread
through
a
biscuit
and
put
one
end
of
it
in
her
mouth
and
one
in
his
and
then
they
had
to
nibble
the
thread
to
see
who
could
get
to
the
biscuit
first
their
faces
would
come
together
they
would
feel
each
other
breathing
their
lips
would
touch
and
they
would
laugh
forcedly
while
their
hands
would
turn
to
ice
would
feel
a
desire
to
bite
to
hurt
he
would
fling
back
and
she
would
go
on
laughing
forcedly
they
would
turn
away
pretend
indifference
and
steal
glances
at
each
other
these
disturbing
games
had
a
disquieting
attraction
for
them
they
wanted
to
play
them
and
yet
avoided
them
was
fearful
of
them
and
preferred
even
the
constraint
of
the
meetings
when
frau
von
kerich
or
some
one
else
was
present
so
outside
presence
could
break
in
upon
the
converse
of
their
loving
hearts
constraint
only
made
their
love
sweeter
and
more
intense
everything
gained
infinitely
in
value
a
word
a
movement
of
the
lips
a
glance
were
enough
to
make
the
rich
new
treasure
of
their
inner
life
shine
through
the
dull
veil
of
ordinary
existence
they
alone
could
see
it
or
so
they
thought
and
smiled
happy
in
their
little
mysteries
their
words
were
no
more
than
those
of
a
conversation
about
trivial
matters
to
them
they
were
an
unending
song
of
love
they
read
the
most
fleeting
changes
in
their
faces
and
voices
as
in
an
open
book
they
could
have
read
as
well
with
their
eyes
closed
for
they
had
only
to
listen
to
their
hearts
to
hear
in
them
the
echo
of
the
heart
of
the
beloved
they
were
full
of
confidence
in
life
in
happiness
in
themselves
their
hopes
were
boundless
they
loved
they
were
loved
happy
without
a
shadow
without
a
doubt
without
a
fear
of
the
future
wonderful
serenity
of
those
days
of
spring
not
a
cloud
in
the
sky
a
faith
so
fresh
that
it
seems
that
nothing
can
ever
tarnish
it
a
joy
so
abounding
that
nothing
can
ever
exhaust
it
are
they
living
are
they
dreaming
doubtless
they
are
dreaming
there
is
nothing
in
common
between
life
and
their
dream
nothing
except
in
that
moment
of
magic
they
are
but
a
dream
themselves
their
being
has
melted
away
at
the
touch
of
love
it
was
not
long
before
frau
von
kerich
perceived
their
little
intrigue
which
they
thought
very
subtly
managed
though
it
was
very
clumsy
minna
had
suspected
it
from
the
moment
when
her
mother
had
entered
suddenly
one
day
when
she
was
talking
to
and
standing
as
near
to
him
as
she
could
and
on
the
click
of
the
door
they
had
darted
apart
as
quickly
as
possible
covered
with
confusion
frau
von
kerich
had
pretended
to
see
nothing
minna
was
almost
sorry
she
would
have
liked
a
tussle
with
her
mother
it
would
have
been
more
romantic
her
mother
took
care
to
give
her
no
opportunity
for
it
she
was
too
clever
to
be
anxious
or
to
make
any
remark
about
it
but
to
minna
she
talked
ironically
about
and
made
merciless
fun
of
his
foibles
she
demolished
him
in
a
few
words
she
did
not
do
it
deliberately
she
acted
upon
instinct
with
the
treachery
natural
to
a
woman
who
is
defending
her
own
it
was
useless
for
minna
to
resist
and
sulk
and
be
impertinent
and
go
on
denying
the
truth
of
her
remarks
there
was
only
too
much
justification
for
them
and
frau
von
kerich
had
a
cruel
skill
in
flicking
the
raw
spot
the
largeness
of
boots
the
ugliness
of
his
clothes
his
hat
his
provincial
accent
his
ridiculous
way
of
bowing
the
vulgarity
of
his
nothing
was
forgotten
which
might
sting
minna
vanity
such
remarks
were
always
simple
and
made
by
the
way
they
never
took
the
form
of
a
set
speech
and
when
minna
irritated
got
upon
her
high
horse
to
reply
frau
von
kerich
would
innocently
be
off
on
another
subject
but
the
blow
struck
home
and
minna
was
sore
under
it
she
began
to
look
at
with
a
less
indulgent
eye
he
was
vaguely
conscious
of
it
and
uneasily
asked
her
why
do
you
look
at
me
like
that
and
she
answered
oh
nothing
but
a
moment
after
when
he
was
merry
she
would
harshly
reproach
him
for
laughing
so
loudly
he
was
abashed
he
never
would
have
thought
that
he
would
have
to
take
care
not
to
laugh
too
loudly
with
her
all
his
gaiety
was
spoiled
or
when
he
was
talking
absolutely
at
his
ease
she
would
absently
interrupt
him
to
make
some
unpleasant
remark
about
his
clothes
or
she
would
take
exception
to
his
common
expressions
with
pedantic
aggressiveness
then
he
would
lose
all
desire
to
talk
and
sometimes
would
be
cross
then
he
would
persuade
himself
that
these
ways
which
so
irritated
him
were
a
proof
of
minna
interest
in
him
and
she
would
persuade
herself
also
that
it
was
so
he
would
try
humbly
to
do
better
but
she
was
never
much
pleased
with
him
for
he
hardly
ever
succeeded
but
he
had
no
time
nor
had
minna
to
perceive
the
change
that
was
taking
place
in
her
easter
came
and
minna
had
to
go
with
her
mother
to
stay
with
some
relations
near
weimar
during
the
last
week
before
the
separation
they
returned
to
the
intimacy
of
the
first
days
except
for
little
outbursts
of
impatience
minna
was
more
affectionate
than
ever
on
the
eve
of
her
departure
they
went
for
a
long
walk
in
the
park
she
led
mysteriously
to
the
arbor
and
put
about
his
neck
a
little
scented
bag
in
which
she
had
placed
a
lock
of
her
hair
they
renewed
their
eternal
vows
and
swore
to
write
to
each
other
every
day
and
they
chose
a
star
out
of
the
sky
and
arranged
to
look
at
it
every
evening
at
the
same
time
the
fatal
day
arrived
ten
times
during
the
night
he
had
asked
himself
where
will
she
be
and
now
he
thought
it
is
this
morning
she
is
still
here
she
will
be
here
no
longer
he
went
to
her
house
before
eight
she
was
not
up
he
set
out
to
walk
in
the
park
he
could
not
he
returned
the
passages
were
full
of
boxes
and
parcels
he
sat
down
in
a
corner
of
the
room
listening
for
the
creaking
of
doors
and
floors
and
recognizing
the
footsteps
on
the
floor
above
him
frau
von
kerich
passed
smiled
as
she
saw
him
and
without
stopping
threw
him
a
mocking
minna
came
at
last
she
was
pale
her
eyelids
were
swollen
she
had
not
slept
any
more
than
he
during
the
night
she
gave
orders
busily
to
the
servants
she
held
out
her
hand
to
and
went
on
talking
to
old
frida
she
was
ready
to
go
frau
von
kerich
came
back
they
argued
about
a
minna
seemed
to
pay
no
attention
to
who
was
standing
forgotten
and
unhappy
by
the
piano
she
went
out
with
her
mother
then
came
back
from
the
door
she
called
out
to
frau
von
kerich
she
closed
the
door
they
were
alone
she
ran
to
him
took
his
hand
and
dragged
him
into
the
little
room
next
door
its
shutters
were
closed
then
she
put
her
face
up
to
and
kissed
him
wildly
with
tears
in
her
eyes
she
said
you
promise
you
promise
that
you
will
love
me
always
they
sobbed
quietly
and
made
convulsive
efforts
to
choke
their
sobs
down
so
as
not
to
be
heard
they
broke
apart
as
they
heard
footsteps
approaching
minna
dried
her
eyes
and
resumed
her
busy
air
with
the
servants
but
her
voice
trembled
he
succeeded
in
snatching
her
handkerchief
which
she
had
let
fall
her
little
dirty
handkerchief
crumpled
and
wet
with
her
tears
he
went
to
the
station
with
his
friends
in
their
carriage
sitting
opposite
each
other
and
minna
hardly
dared
look
at
each
other
for
fear
of
bursting
into
tears
their
hands
sought
each
other
and
clasped
until
they
hurt
frau
von
kerich
watched
them
with
quizzical
and
seemed
not
to
see
anything
the
time
arrived
was
standing
by
the
door
of
the
train
when
it
began
to
move
and
he
ran
alongside
the
carriage
not
looking
where
he
was
going
jostling
against
porters
his
eyes
fixed
on
minna
eyes
until
the
train
was
gone
he
went
on
running
until
it
was
lost
from
sight
then
he
stopped
out
of
breath
and
found
himself
on
the
station
platform
among
people
of
no
importance
he
went
home
and
fortunately
his
family
were
all
out
and
all
through
the
morning
he
wept
for
the
first
time
he
knew
the
frightful
sorrow
of
parting
an
intolerable
torture
for
all
loving
hearts
the
world
is
empty
life
is
empty
all
is
empty
the
heart
is
choked
it
is
impossible
to
breathe
there
is
mortal
agony
it
is
difficult
impossible
to
live
especially
when
all
around
you
there
are
the
traces
of
the
departed
loved
one
when
everything
about
you
is
forever
calling
up
her
image
when
you
remain
in
the
surroundings
in
which
you
lived
together
she
and
you
when
it
is
a
torment
to
try
to
live
again
in
the
same
places
the
happiness
that
is
gone
then
it
is
as
though
an
abyss
were
opened
at
your
feet
you
lean
over
it
you
turn
giddy
you
almost
fall
you
fall
you
think
you
are
face
to
face
with
death
and
so
you
are
parting
is
one
of
his
faces
you
watch
the
beloved
of
your
heart
pass
away
life
is
effaced
only
a
black
hole
is
left
nothingness
went
and
visited
all
the
beloved
spots
so
as
to
suffer
more
frau
von
kerich
had
left
him
the
key
of
the
garden
so
that
he
could
go
there
while
they
were
away
he
went
there
that
very
day
and
was
like
to
choke
with
sorrow
it
seemed
to
him
as
he
entered
that
he
might
find
there
a
little
of
her
who
was
gone
he
found
only
too
much
of
her
her
image
hovered
over
all
the
lawns
he
expected
to
see
her
appear
at
all
the
corners
of
the
paths
he
knew
well
that
she
would
not
appear
but
he
tormented
himself
with
pretending
that
she
might
and
he
went
over
the
tracks
of
his
memories
of
love
the
path
to
the
labyrinth
the
terrace
carpeted
with
wistaria
the
seat
in
the
arbor
and
he
inflicted
torture
on
himself
by
saying
a
week
ago
three
days
ago
yesterday
it
was
so
yesterday
she
was
here
this
very
morning
he
racked
his
heart
with
these
thoughts
until
he
had
to
stop
choking
and
like
to
die
in
his
sorrow
was
mingled
anger
with
himself
for
having
wasted
all
that
time
and
not
having
made
use
of
it
so
many
minutes
so
many
hours
when
he
had
enjoyed
the
infinite
happiness
of
seeing
her
breathing
her
and
feeding
upon
her
and
he
had
not
appreciated
it
he
had
let
the
time
go
by
without
having
tasted
to
the
full
every
tiny
moment
and
now
now
it
was
too
late
irreparable
irreparable
he
went
home
his
family
seemed
odious
to
him
he
could
not
bear
their
faces
their
gestures
their
fatuous
conversation
the
same
as
that
of
the
preceding
day
the
same
as
that
of
all
the
preceding
days
always
the
same
they
went
on
living
their
usual
life
as
though
no
such
misfortune
had
come
to
pass
in
their
midst
and
the
town
had
no
more
idea
of
it
than
they
the
people
were
all
going
about
their
affairs
laughing
noisy
busy
the
crickets
were
chirping
the
sky
was
bright
he
hated
them
all
he
felt
himself
crushed
by
this
universal
egoism
but
he
himself
was
more
egoistic
than
the
whole
universe
nothing
was
worth
while
to
him
he
had
no
kindness
he
loved
nobody
he
passed
several
lamentable
days
his
work
absorbed
him
again
automatically
but
he
had
no
heart
for
living
one
evening
when
he
was
at
supper
with
his
family
silent
and
depressed
the
postman
knocked
at
the
door
and
left
a
letter
for
him
his
heart
knew
the
sender
of
it
before
he
had
seen
the
handwriting
four
pairs
of
eyes
fixed
on
him
with
undisguised
curiosity
waited
for
him
to
read
it
clutching
at
the
hope
that
this
interruption
might
take
them
out
of
their
usual
boredom
he
placed
the
letter
by
his
plate
and
would
not
open
it
pretending
carelessly
that
he
knew
what
it
was
about
but
his
brothers
annoyed
would
not
believe
it
and
went
on
prying
at
it
and
so
he
was
in
tortures
until
the
meal
was
ended
then
he
was
free
to
lock
himself
up
in
his
room
his
heart
was
beating
so
that
he
almost
tore
the
letter
as
he
opened
it
he
trembled
to
think
what
might
be
in
it
but
as
soon
as
he
had
glanced
over
the
first
words
he
was
filled
with
joy
a
few
very
affectionate
words
minna
was
writing
to
him
by
stealth
she
called
him
dear
and
told
him
that
she
had
wept
much
had
looked
at
the
star
every
evening
that
she
had
been
to
frankfort
which
was
a
splendid
town
where
there
were
wonderful
shops
but
that
she
had
never
bothered
about
anything
because
she
was
thinking
of
him
she
reminded
him
that
he
had
sworn
to
be
faithful
to
her
and
not
to
see
anybody
while
she
was
away
so
that
he
might
think
only
of
her
she
wanted
him
to
work
all
the
time
while
she
was
gone
so
as
to
make
himself
famous
and
her
too
she
ended
by
asking
him
if
he
remembered
the
little
room
where
they
had
said
on
the
morning
when
she
had
left
him
she
assured
him
that
she
would
be
there
still
in
thought
and
that
she
would
still
say
to
him
in
the
same
way
she
signed
herself
eternally
yours
eternally
and
she
had
added
a
postscript
bidding
him
buy
a
straw
hat
instead
of
his
ugly
felt
all
the
distinguished
people
there
were
wearing
them
a
coarse
straw
hat
with
a
broad
blue
ribbon
read
the
letter
four
times
before
he
could
quite
take
it
all
in
he
was
so
overwhelmed
that
he
could
not
even
be
happy
and
suddenly
he
felt
so
tired
that
he
lay
down
and
read
and
the
letter
and
kissed
it
again
and
again
he
put
it
under
his
pillow
and
his
hand
was
forever
making
sure
that
it
was
there
an
ineffable
sense
of
permeated
his
whole
soul
he
slept
all
through
the
night
his
life
became
more
tolerable
he
had
ever
sweet
soaring
thoughts
of
minna
he
set
about
answering
her
but
he
could
not
write
freely
to
her
he
had
to
hide
his
feelings
that
was
painful
and
difficult
for
him
he
continued
clumsily
to
conceal
his
love
beneath
formulæ
of
ceremonious
politeness
which
he
always
used
in
an
absurd
fashion
when
he
had
sent
it
he
awaited
minna
reply
and
only
lived
in
expectation
of
it
to
win
patience
he
tried
to
go
for
walks
and
to
read
but
his
thoughts
were
only
of
minna
he
went
on
crazily
repeating
her
name
over
and
over
again
he
was
so
abject
in
his
love
and
worship
of
her
name
that
he
carried
everywhere
with
him
a
volume
of
lessing
because
the
name
of
minna
occurred
in
it
and
every
day
when
he
left
the
theater
he
went
a
long
distance
out
of
his
way
so
as
to
pass
a
mercery
shop
on
whose
signboard
the
five
adored
letters
were
written
he
reproached
himself
for
wasting
time
when
she
had
bid
him
so
urgently
to
work
so
as
to
make
her
famous
the
naïve
vanity
of
her
request
touched
him
as
a
mark
of
her
confidence
in
him
he
resolved
by
way
of
fulfilling
it
to
write
a
work
which
should
be
not
only
dedicated
but
consecrated
to
her
he
could
not
have
written
any
other
at
that
time
hardly
had
the
scheme
occurred
to
him
than
musical
ideas
rushed
in
upon
him
it
was
like
a
flood
of
water
accumulated
in
a
reservoir
for
several
months
until
it
should
suddenly
rush
down
breaking
all
its
dams
he
did
not
leave
his
room
for
a
week
louisa
left
his
dinner
at
the
door
for
he
did
not
allow
even
her
to
enter
he
wrote
a
quintette
for
clarionet
and
strings
the
first
movement
was
a
poem
of
youthful
hope
and
desire
the
last
a
lover
joke
in
which
wild
humor
peeped
out
but
the
whole
work
was
written
for
the
sake
of
the
second
movement
the
in
which
had
depicted
an
ardent
and
ingenuous
little
soul
which
was
or
was
meant
to
be
a
portrait
of
minna
no
one
would
have
recognized
it
least
of
all
herself
but
the
great
thing
was
that
it
was
perfectly
recognizable
to
himself
and
he
had
a
thrill
of
pleasure
in
the
illusion
of
feeling
that
he
had
caught
the
essence
of
his
beloved
no
work
had
ever
been
so
easily
or
happily
written
it
was
an
outlet
for
the
excess
of
love
which
the
parting
had
stored
up
in
him
and
at
the
same
time
his
care
for
the
work
of
art
the
effort
necessary
to
dominate
and
concentrate
his
passion
into
a
beautiful
and
clear
form
gave
him
a
healthiness
of
mind
a
balance
in
his
faculties
which
gave
him
a
sort
of
physical
delight
a
sovereign
enjoyment
known
to
every
creative
artist
while
he
is
creating
he
escapes
altogether
from
the
slavery
of
desire
and
sorrow
he
becomes
then
master
in
his
turn
and
all
that
gave
him
joy
or
suffering
seems
then
to
him
to
be
only
the
fine
play
of
his
will
such
moments
are
too
short
for
when
they
are
done
he
finds
about
him
more
heavy
than
ever
the
chains
of
reality
while
was
busy
with
his
work
he
hardly
had
time
to
think
of
his
parting
from
minna
he
was
living
with
her
minna
was
no
longer
in
minna
she
was
in
himself
but
when
he
had
finished
he
found
that
he
was
alone
more
alone
than
before
more
weary
exhausted
by
the
effort
he
remembered
that
it
was
a
fortnight
since
he
had
written
to
minna
and
that
she
had
not
replied
he
wrote
to
her
again
and
this
time
he
could
not
bring
himself
altogether
to
exercise
the
constraint
which
he
had
imposed
on
himself
for
the
first
letter
he
reproached
minna
jocularly
for
he
did
not
believe
it
himself
with
having
forgotten
him
he
scolded
her
for
her
laziness
and
teased
her
affectionately
he
spoke
of
his
work
with
much
mystery
so
as
to
rouse
her
curiosity
and
because
he
wished
to
keep
it
as
a
surprise
for
her
when
she
returned
he
described
minutely
the
hat
that
he
had
bought
and
he
told
how
to
carry
out
the
little
despot
orders
for
he
had
taken
all
her
commands
literally
he
did
not
go
out
at
all
and
said
that
he
was
ill
as
an
excuse
for
refusing
invitations
he
did
not
add
that
he
was
even
on
bad
terms
with
the
grand
duke
because
in
excess
of
zeal
he
had
refused
to
go
to
a
party
at
the
palace
to
which
he
had
been
invited
the
whole
letter
was
full
of
a
careless
joy
and
conveyed
those
little
secrets
so
dear
to
lovers
he
imagined
that
minna
alone
had
the
key
to
them
and
thought
himself
very
clever
because
he
had
carefully
replaced
every
word
of
love
with
words
of
friendship
after
he
had
written
he
felt
comforted
for
a
moment
first
because
the
letter
had
given
him
the
illusion
of
conversation
with
his
absent
fair
but
chiefly
because
he
had
no
doubt
but
that
minna
would
reply
to
it
at
once
he
was
very
patient
for
the
three
days
which
he
had
allowed
for
the
post
to
take
his
letter
to
minna
and
bring
back
her
answer
but
when
the
fourth
day
had
passed
he
began
once
more
to
find
life
difficult
he
had
no
energy
or
interest
in
things
except
during
the
hour
before
the
post
arrival
then
he
was
trembling
with
impatience
he
became
superstitious
and
looked
for
the
smallest
sign
the
crackling
of
the
fire
a
chance
word
to
give
him
an
assurance
that
the
letter
would
come
once
that
hour
was
passed
he
would
collapse
again
no
more
work
no
more
walks
the
only
object
of
his
existence
was
to
wait
for
the
next
post
and
all
his
energy
was
expended
in
finding
strength
to
wait
for
so
long
but
when
evening
came
and
all
hope
was
gone
for
the
day
then
he
was
crushed
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
never
live
until
the
morrow
and
he
would
stay
for
hours
sitting
at
his
table
without
speaking
or
thinking
without
even
the
power
to
go
to
bed
until
some
remnant
of
his
will
would
take
him
off
to
it
and
he
would
sleep
heavily
haunted
by
stupid
dreams
which
made
him
think
that
the
night
would
never
end
this
continual
expectation
became
at
length
a
physical
torture
an
actual
illness
went
so
far
as
to
suspect
his
father
his
brother
even
the
postman
of
having
taken
the
letter
and
hidden
it
from
him
he
was
racked
with
uneasiness
he
never
doubted
minna
fidelity
for
an
instant
if
she
did
not
write
it
must
be
because
she
was
ill
dying
perhaps
dead
then
he
rushed
to
his
pen
and
wrote
a
third
letter
a
few
heartrending
lines
in
which
he
had
no
more
thought
of
guarding
his
feelings
than
of
taking
care
with
his
spelling
the
time
for
the
post
to
go
was
drawing
near
he
had
crossed
out
and
smudged
the
sheet
as
he
turned
it
over
dirtied
the
envelope
as
he
closed
it
no
matter
he
could
not
wait
until
the
next
post
he
ran
and
hurled
his
letter
into
the
box
and
waited
in
mortal
agony
on
the
next
night
but
one
he
had
a
clear
vision
of
minna
ill
calling
to
him
he
got
up
and
was
on
the
point
of
setting
out
on
foot
to
go
to
her
but
where
where
should
he
find
her
on
the
fourth
morning
minna
letter
came
at
last
hardly
a
cold
and
stiff
minna
said
that
she
did
not
understand
what
could
have
filled
him
with
such
stupid
fears
that
she
was
quite
well
that
she
had
no
time
to
write
and
begged
him
not
to
get
so
excited
in
future
and
not
to
write
any
more
was
stunned
he
never
doubted
minna
sincerity
he
blamed
himself
he
thought
that
minna
was
justly
annoyed
by
the
impudent
and
absurd
letters
that
he
had
written
he
thought
himself
an
idiot
and
beat
at
his
head
with
his
fist
but
it
was
all
in
vain
he
was
forced
to
feel
that
minna
did
not
love
him
as
much
as
he
loved
her
the
days
that
followed
were
so
mournful
that
it
is
impossible
to
describe
them
nothingness
can
not
be
described
deprived
of
the
only
boon
that
made
living
worth
while
for
him
his
letters
to
minna
now
only
lived
mechanically
and
the
only
thing
which
interested
him
at
all
was
when
in
the
evening
as
he
was
going
to
bed
he
ticked
off
on
the
calendar
like
a
schoolboy
one
of
the
interminable
days
which
lay
between
himself
and
minna
return
the
day
of
the
return
was
past
they
ought
to
have
been
at
home
a
week
feverish
excitement
had
succeeded
prostration
minna
had
promised
when
she
left
to
advise
him
of
the
day
and
hour
of
their
arrival
he
waited
from
moment
to
moment
to
go
and
meet
them
and
he
tied
himself
up
in
a
web
of
guesses
as
to
the
reasons
for
their
delay
one
evening
one
of
their
neighbors
a
friend
of
his
grandfather
fischer
the
furniture
dealer
came
in
to
smoke
and
chat
with
melchior
after
dinner
as
he
often
did
in
torment
was
going
up
to
his
room
after
waiting
for
the
postman
to
pass
when
a
word
made
him
tremble
fischer
said
that
next
day
he
had
to
go
early
in
the
morning
to
the
kerichs
to
hang
up
the
curtains
stopped
dead
and
asked
have
they
returned
you
wag
you
know
that
as
well
as
i
do
said
old
fischer
roguishly
fine
weather
they
came
back
the
day
before
yesterday
heard
no
more
he
left
the
room
and
got
ready
to
go
out
his
mother
who
for
some
time
had
secretly
been
watching
him
without
his
knowing
it
followed
him
into
the
lobby
and
asked
him
timidly
where
he
was
going
he
made
no
answer
and
went
out
he
was
hurt
he
ran
to
the
kerichs
house
it
was
nine
in
the
evening
they
were
both
in
the
and
did
not
appear
to
be
surprised
to
see
him
they
said
quietly
minna
was
busy
writing
and
held
out
her
hand
over
the
table
and
went
on
with
her
letter
vaguely
asking
him
for
his
news
she
asked
him
to
forgive
her
discourtesy
and
pretended
to
be
listening
to
what
he
said
but
she
interrupted
him
to
ask
something
of
her
mother
he
had
prepared
touching
words
concerning
all
that
he
had
suffered
during
her
absence
he
could
hardly
summon
a
few
words
no
one
was
interested
in
them
and
he
had
not
the
heart
to
go
on
it
all
rang
so
false
when
minna
had
finished
her
letter
she
took
up
some
work
and
sitting
a
little
away
from
him
began
to
tell
him
about
her
travels
she
talked
about
the
pleasant
weeks
she
had
spent
riding
on
horseback
life
interesting
society
she
got
excited
gradually
and
made
allusions
to
events
and
people
whom
did
not
know
and
the
memory
of
them
made
her
mother
and
herself
laugh
felt
that
he
was
a
stranger
during
the
story
he
did
not
know
how
to
take
it
and
laughed
awkwardly
he
never
took
his
eyes
from
minna
face
beseeching
her
to
look
at
him
imploring
her
to
throw
him
a
glance
for
alms
but
when
she
did
look
at
him
which
was
not
often
for
she
addressed
herself
more
to
her
mother
than
to
him
her
eyes
like
her
voice
were
cold
and
indifferent
was
she
so
constrained
because
of
her
mother
or
was
it
that
he
did
not
understand
he
wished
to
speak
to
her
alone
but
frau
von
kerich
never
left
them
for
a
moment
he
tried
to
bring
the
conversation
round
to
some
subject
interesting
to
himself
he
spoke
of
his
work
and
his
plans
he
was
dimly
conscious
that
minna
was
evading
him
and
instinctively
he
tried
to
interest
her
in
himself
indeed
she
seemed
to
listen
attentively
enough
she
broke
in
upon
his
narrative
with
various
interjections
which
were
never
very
apt
but
always
seemed
to
be
full
of
interest
but
just
as
he
was
beginning
to
hope
once
more
carried
off
his
feet
by
one
of
her
charming
smiles
he
saw
minna
put
her
little
hand
to
her
lips
and
yawn
he
broke
off
short
she
saw
that
and
asked
his
pardon
amiably
saying
that
she
was
tired
he
got
up
thinking
that
they
would
persuade
him
to
stay
but
they
said
nothing
he
spun
out
his
and
waited
for
a
word
to
ask
him
to
come
again
next
day
there
was
no
suggestion
of
it
he
had
to
go
minna
did
not
take
him
to
the
door
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
an
indifferent
hand
that
drooped
limply
in
his
and
he
took
his
leave
of
them
in
the
middle
of
the
room
he
went
home
with
terror
in
his
heart
of
the
minna
of
two
months
before
of
his
beloved
minna
nothing
was
left
what
had
happened
what
had
become
of
her
for
a
poor
boy
who
has
never
yet
experienced
the
continual
change
the
complete
disappearance
and
the
absolute
renovation
of
living
souls
of
which
the
majority
are
not
so
much
souls
as
collections
of
souls
in
succession
changing
and
dying
away
continually
the
simple
truth
was
too
cruel
for
him
to
be
able
to
believe
it
he
rejected
the
idea
of
it
in
terror
and
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
see
properly
and
that
minna
was
just
the
same
he
decided
to
go
again
to
the
house
next
morning
and
to
talk
to
her
at
all
costs
he
did
not
sleep
through
the
night
he
counted
one
after
another
the
chimes
of
the
clock
from
one
on
he
was
rambling
round
the
kerichs
house
he
entered
it
as
soon
as
he
could
he
did
not
see
minna
but
frau
von
kerich
always
busy
and
an
early
riser
she
was
watering
the
pots
of
flowers
on
the
veranda
she
gave
a
mocking
cry
when
she
saw
ah
she
said
it
is
you
i
am
glad
you
have
come
i
have
something
to
talk
to
you
about
wait
a
moment
she
went
in
for
a
moment
to
put
down
her
watering
can
and
to
dry
her
hands
and
came
back
with
a
little
smile
as
she
saw
discomfiture
he
was
conscious
of
the
approach
of
disaster
come
into
the
garden
she
said
we
shall
be
quieter
in
the
garden
that
was
full
still
of
his
love
he
followed
frau
von
kerich
she
did
not
hasten
to
speak
and
enjoyed
the
boy
uneasiness
let
us
sit
here
she
said
at
last
they
were
sitting
on
the
seat
in
the
place
where
minna
had
held
up
her
lips
to
him
on
the
eve
of
her
departure
i
think
you
know
what
is
the
matter
said
frau
von
kerich
looking
serious
so
as
to
complete
his
confusion
i
should
never
have
thought
it
of
you
i
thought
you
a
serious
boy
i
had
every
confidence
in
you
i
should
never
have
thought
that
you
would
abuse
it
to
try
and
turn
my
daughter
head
she
was
in
your
keeping
you
ought
to
have
shown
respect
for
her
respect
for
me
respect
for
yourself
there
was
a
light
irony
in
her
accents
frau
von
kerich
attached
not
the
least
importance
to
this
childish
love
affair
but
was
not
conscious
of
it
and
her
reproaches
which
he
took
as
he
took
everything
tragically
went
to
his
heart
but
madam
but
madam
he
stammered
with
tears
in
his
eyes
i
have
never
abused
your
confidence
please
do
not
think
that
i
am
not
a
bad
man
that
i
swear
i
love
fräulein
minna
i
love
her
with
all
my
soul
and
i
wish
to
marry
her
frau
von
kerich
smiled
no
my
poor
boy
she
said
with
that
kindly
smile
in
which
was
so
much
disdain
as
at
last
he
was
to
understand
no
it
is
impossible
it
is
just
a
childish
folly
why
why
he
asked
he
took
her
hands
not
believing
that
she
could
be
speaking
seriously
and
almost
reassured
by
the
new
softness
in
her
voice
she
smiled
still
and
said
because
he
insisted
with
ironical
deliberation
she
did
not
take
him
altogether
seriously
she
told
him
that
he
had
no
fortune
that
minna
had
different
tastes
he
protested
that
that
made
no
difference
that
he
would
be
rich
famous
that
he
would
win
honors
money
all
that
minna
could
desire
frau
von
kerich
looked
skeptical
she
was
amused
by
his
and
only
shook
her
head
by
way
of
saying
no
but
he
stuck
to
it
no
she
said
firmly
no
it
is
not
worth
arguing
it
is
impossible
it
is
not
only
a
question
of
money
so
many
things
the
position
she
had
no
need
to
finish
that
was
a
needle
that
pierced
to
his
very
marrow
his
eyes
were
opened
he
saw
the
irony
of
the
friendly
smile
he
saw
the
coldness
of
the
kindly
look
he
understood
suddenly
what
it
was
that
separated
him
from
this
woman
whom
he
loved
as
a
son
this
woman
who
seemed
to
treat
him
like
a
mother
he
was
conscious
of
all
that
was
patronizing
and
disdainful
in
her
affection
he
got
up
he
was
pale
frau
von
kerich
went
on
talking
to
him
in
her
caressing
voice
but
it
was
the
end
he
heard
no
more
the
music
of
the
words
he
perceived
under
every
word
the
falseness
of
that
elegant
soul
he
could
not
answer
a
word
he
went
everything
about
him
was
going
round
and
round
when
he
regained
his
room
he
flung
himself
on
his
bed
and
gave
way
to
a
fit
of
anger
and
injured
pride
just
as
he
used
to
do
when
he
was
a
little
boy
he
bit
his
pillow
he
crammed
his
handkerchief
into
his
mouth
so
that
no
one
should
hear
him
crying
he
hated
frau
von
kerich
he
hated
minna
he
despised
them
mightily
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
been
insulted
and
he
trembled
with
shame
and
rage
he
had
to
reply
to
take
immediate
action
if
he
could
not
avenge
himself
he
would
die
he
got
up
and
wrote
an
idiotically
violent
letter
madam
i
do
not
know
if
as
you
say
you
have
been
deceived
in
me
but
i
do
know
that
i
have
been
cruelly
deceived
in
you
i
thought
that
you
were
my
friends
you
said
so
you
pretended
to
be
so
and
i
loved
you
more
than
my
life
i
see
now
that
it
was
all
a
lie
that
your
affection
for
me
was
only
a
sham
you
made
use
of
me
i
amused
you
provided
you
with
entertainment
made
music
for
you
i
was
your
servant
your
servant
that
i
am
not
i
am
no
man
servant
you
have
made
me
feel
cruelly
that
i
had
no
right
to
love
your
daughter
nothing
in
the
world
can
prevent
my
heart
from
loving
where
it
loves
and
if
i
am
not
your
equal
in
rank
i
am
as
noble
as
you
it
is
the
heart
that
ennobles
a
man
if
i
am
not
a
count
i
have
perhaps
more
honor
than
many
counts
lackey
or
count
when
a
man
insults
me
i
despise
him
i
despise
as
much
any
one
who
pretends
to
be
noble
and
is
not
noble
of
soul
farewell
you
have
mistaken
me
you
have
deceived
me
i
detest
you
he
who
in
spite
of
you
loves
and
will
love
till
death
fräulein
minna
she
is
and
nothing
can
take
her
from
him
hardly
had
he
thrown
his
letter
into
the
box
than
he
was
filled
with
terror
at
what
he
had
done
he
tried
not
to
think
of
it
but
certain
phrases
cropped
up
in
his
memory
he
was
in
a
cold
sweat
as
he
thought
of
frau
von
kerich
reading
those
enormities
at
first
he
was
upheld
by
his
very
despair
but
next
day
he
saw
that
his
letter
could
only
bring
about
a
final
separation
from
minna
and
that
seemed
to
him
the
direst
of
misfortunes
he
still
hoped
that
frau
von
kerich
who
knew
his
violent
fits
would
not
take
it
seriously
that
she
would
only
reprimand
him
severely
and
who
knows
that
she
would
be
touched
perhaps
by
the
sincerity
of
his
passion
one
word
and
he
would
have
thrown
himself
at
her
feet
he
waited
for
five
days
then
came
a
letter
she
said
dear
sir
since
as
you
say
there
has
been
a
misunderstanding
between
us
it
would
be
wise
not
any
further
to
prolong
it
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
force
upon
you
a
relationship
which
has
become
painful
to
you
you
will
think
it
natural
therefore
that
we
should
break
it
off
i
hope
that
you
will
in
time
to
come
have
no
lack
of
other
friends
who
will
be
able
to
appreciate
you
as
you
wish
to
be
appreciated
i
have
no
doubt
as
to
your
future
and
from
a
distance
shall
with
sympathy
follow
your
progress
in
your
musical
career
kind
regards
josepha
von
kerich
the
most
bitter
reproaches
would
have
been
less
cruel
saw
that
he
was
lost
it
is
possible
to
reply
to
an
unjust
accusation
but
what
is
to
be
done
against
the
negativeness
of
such
polite
indifference
he
raged
against
it
he
thought
that
he
would
never
see
minna
again
and
he
could
not
bear
it
he
felt
how
little
all
the
pride
in
the
world
weighs
against
a
little
love
he
forgot
his
dignity
he
became
cowardly
he
wrote
more
letters
in
which
he
implored
forgiveness
they
were
no
less
stupid
than
the
letter
in
which
he
had
railed
against
her
they
evoked
no
response
and
everything
was
said
he
nearly
died
of
it
he
thought
of
killing
himself
he
thought
of
murder
at
least
he
imagined
that
he
thought
of
it
he
was
possessed
by
incendiary
and
murderous
desires
people
have
little
idea
of
the
paroxysm
of
love
or
hate
which
sometimes
devours
the
hearts
of
children
it
was
the
most
terrible
crisis
of
his
childhood
it
ended
his
childhood
it
stiffened
his
will
but
it
came
near
to
breaking
it
forever
he
found
life
impossible
he
would
sit
for
hours
with
his
elbows
on
the
looking
down
into
the
courtyard
and
dreaming
as
he
used
to
when
he
was
a
little
boy
of
some
means
of
escaping
from
the
torture
of
life
when
it
became
too
great
the
remedy
was
there
under
his
eyes
immediate
immediate
how
could
one
know
perhaps
after
hours
centuries
horrible
sufferings
but
so
utter
was
his
childish
despair
that
he
let
himself
be
carried
away
by
the
giddy
round
of
such
thoughts
louisa
saw
that
he
was
suffering
she
could
not
gauge
exactly
what
was
happening
to
him
but
her
instinct
gave
her
a
dim
warning
of
danger
she
tried
to
approach
her
son
to
discover
his
sorrow
so
as
to
console
him
but
the
poor
woman
had
lost
the
habit
of
talking
intimately
to
for
many
years
he
had
kept
his
thoughts
to
himself
and
she
had
been
too
much
taken
up
by
the
material
cares
of
life
to
find
time
to
discover
them
or
divine
them
now
that
she
would
so
gladly
have
come
to
his
aid
she
knew
not
what
to
do
she
hovered
about
him
like
a
soul
in
torment
she
would
gladly
have
found
words
to
bring
him
comfort
and
she
dared
not
speak
for
fear
of
irritating
him
and
in
spite
of
all
her
care
she
did
irritate
him
by
her
every
gesture
and
by
her
very
presence
for
she
was
not
very
adroit
and
he
was
not
very
indulgent
and
yet
he
loved
her
they
loved
each
other
but
so
little
is
needed
to
part
two
creatures
who
are
dear
to
each
other
and
love
each
other
with
all
their
hearts
a
too
violent
expression
an
awkward
gesture
a
harmless
twitching
of
an
eye
or
a
nose
a
trick
of
eating
walking
or
laughing
a
physical
constraint
which
is
beyond
analysis
you
say
that
these
things
are
nothing
and
yet
they
are
all
the
world
often
they
are
enough
to
keep
a
mother
and
a
son
a
brother
and
a
brother
a
friend
and
a
friend
who
live
in
proximity
to
each
other
forever
strangers
to
each
other
did
not
find
in
his
mother
grief
a
sufficient
prop
in
the
crisis
through
which
he
was
passing
besides
what
is
the
affection
of
others
to
the
egoism
of
passion
preoccupied
with
itself
one
night
when
his
family
were
sleeping
and
he
was
sitting
by
his
desk
not
thinking
or
moving
he
was
engulfed
in
his
perilous
ideas
when
a
sound
of
footsteps
resounded
down
the
little
silent
street
and
a
knock
on
the
door
brought
him
from
his
stupor
there
was
a
murmuring
of
thick
voices
he
remembered
that
his
father
had
not
come
in
and
he
thought
angrily
that
they
were
bringing
him
back
drunk
as
they
had
done
a
week
or
two
before
when
they
had
found
him
lying
in
the
street
for
melchior
had
abandoned
all
restraint
and
was
more
and
more
the
victim
of
his
vice
though
his
athletic
health
seemed
not
in
the
least
to
suffer
from
an
excess
and
a
recklessness
which
would
have
killed
any
other
man
he
ate
enough
for
four
drank
until
he
dropped
passed
whole
nights
out
of
doors
in
icy
rain
was
knocked
down
and
stunned
in
brawls
and
would
get
up
again
next
day
with
his
rowdy
gaiety
wanting
everybody
about
him
to
be
gay
too
louisa
hurrying
up
rushed
to
open
the
door
who
had
not
budged
stopped
his
ears
so
as
not
to
hear
melchior
vicious
voice
and
the
tittering
comments
of
the
neighbors
suddenly
a
strange
terror
seized
him
for
no
reason
he
began
to
tremble
with
his
face
hidden
in
his
hands
and
on
the
instant
a
piercing
cry
made
him
raise
his
head
he
rushed
to
the
door
in
the
midst
of
a
group
of
men
talking
in
low
voices
in
the
dark
passage
lit
only
by
the
flickering
light
of
a
lantern
lying
just
as
his
grandfather
had
done
on
a
stretcher
was
a
body
dripping
with
water
motionless
louisa
was
clinging
to
it
and
sobbing
they
had
just
found
melchior
drowned
in
the
gave
a
cry
everything
else
vanished
all
his
other
sorrows
were
swept
aside
he
threw
himself
on
his
fathers
body
by
louisa
side
and
they
wept
together
seated
by
the
bedside
watching
melchior
last
sleep
on
whose
face
was
now
a
severe
and
solemn
expression
he
felt
the
dark
peace
of
death
enter
into
his
soul
his
childish
passion
was
gone
from
him
like
a
fit
of
fever
the
icy
breath
of
the
grave
had
taken
it
all
away
minna
his
pride
his
love
and
himself
alas
what
misery
how
small
everything
showed
by
the
side
of
this
reality
the
only
reality
death
was
it
worth
while
to
suffer
so
much
to
desire
so
much
to
be
so
much
put
about
to
come
in
the
end
to
that
he
watched
his
father
sleep
and
he
was
filled
with
an
infinite
pity
he
remembered
the
smallest
of
his
acts
of
kindness
and
tenderness
for
with
all
his
faults
melchior
was
not
bad
there
was
much
good
in
him
he
loved
his
family
he
was
honest
he
had
a
little
of
the
uncompromising
probity
of
the
kraffts
which
in
all
questions
of
morality
and
honor
suffered
no
discussion
and
never
would
admit
the
least
of
those
small
moral
impurities
which
so
many
people
in
society
regard
not
altogether
as
faults
he
was
brave
and
whenever
there
was
any
danger
faced
it
with
a
sort
of
enjoyment
if
he
was
extravagant
himself
he
was
so
for
others
too
he
could
not
bear
anybody
to
be
sad
and
very
gladly
gave
away
all
that
belonged
to
him
and
did
not
belong
to
him
to
the
poor
devils
he
met
by
the
wayside
all
his
qualities
appeared
to
now
and
he
invented
some
of
them
or
exaggerated
them
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
misunderstood
his
father
he
reproached
himself
with
not
having
loved
him
enough
he
saw
him
as
broken
by
life
he
thought
he
heard
that
unhappy
soul
drifting
too
weak
to
struggle
crying
out
for
the
life
so
uselessly
lost
he
heard
that
lamentable
entreaty
that
had
so
cut
him
to
the
heart
one
day
do
not
despise
me
and
he
was
overwhelmed
by
remorse
he
threw
himself
on
the
bed
and
kissed
the
dead
face
and
wept
and
as
he
had
done
that
day
he
said
again
dear
father
i
do
not
despise
you
i
love
you
forgive
me
but
that
piteous
entreaty
was
not
appeased
and
went
on
de
not
despise
me
do
not
despise
me
and
suddenly
saw
himself
lying
in
the
place
of
the
dead
man
he
heard
the
terrible
words
coming
from
his
own
lips
he
felt
weighing
on
his
heart
the
despair
of
a
useless
life
irreparably
lost
and
he
thought
in
terror
ah
everything
all
the
suffering
all
the
misery
in
the
world
rather
than
come
to
that
how
near
he
had
been
to
it
had
he
not
all
but
yielded
to
the
temptation
to
snap
off
his
life
himself
cowardly
to
escape
his
sorrow
as
if
all
the
sorrows
all
betrayals
were
not
childish
griefs
beside
the
torture
and
the
crime
of
denial
of
faith
of
in
death
he
saw
that
life
was
a
battle
without
armistice
without
mercy
in
which
he
who
wishes
to
be
a
man
worthy
of
the
name
of
a
man
must
forever
fight
against
whole
armies
of
invisible
enemies
against
the
murderous
forces
of
nature
uneasy
desires
dark
thoughts
treacherously
leading
him
to
degradation
and
destruction
he
saw
that
he
had
been
on
the
point
of
falling
into
the
trap
he
saw
that
happiness
and
love
were
only
the
friends
of
a
moment
to
lead
the
heart
to
disarm
and
abdicate
and
the
little
puritan
of
fifteen
heard
the
voice
of
his
god
go
go
and
never
rest
but
whither
lord
shall
i
go
whatsoever
i
do
whithersoever
i
go
is

not
the

the
house
of
euler
the
house
was
plunged
in
silence
since
melchior
death
everything
seemed
dead
now
that
his
loud
voice
was
stilled
from
morning
to
night
nothing
was
heard
but
the
wearisome
murmuring
of
the
river
christophe
hurled
himself
into
his
work
he
took
a
fiercely
angry
pleasure
in
for
having
wished
to
be
happy
to
expressions
of
sympathy
and
kind
words
he
made
no
reply
but
was
proud
and
stiff
without
a
word
he
went
about
his
daily
task
and
gave
his
lessons
with
icy
politeness
his
pupils
who
knew
of
his
misfortune
were
shocked
by
his
insensibility
but
those
who
were
older
and
had
some
experience
of
sorrow
knew
that
this
apparent
coldness
might
in
a
child
be
used
only
to
conceal
suffering
and
they
pitied
him
he
was
not
grateful
for
their
sympathy
even
music
could
bring
him
no
comfort
he
played
without
pleasure
and
as
a
duty
it
was
as
though
he
found
a
cruel
joy
in
no
longer
taking
pleasure
in
anything
or
in
persuading
himself
that
he
did
not
in
depriving
himself
of
every
reason
for
living
and
yet
going
on
his
two
brothers
terrified
by
the
silence
of
the
house
of
death
ran
away
from
it
as
quickly
as
possible
rodolphe
went
into
the
office
of
his
uncle
theodore
and
lived
with
him
and
ernest
after
trying
two
or
three
trades
found
work
on
one
of
the
rhine
steamers
plying
between
mainz
and
cologne
and
he
used
to
come
back
only
when
he
wanted
money
christophe
was
left
alone
with
his
mother
in
the
house
which
was
too
large
for
them
and
the
meagerness
of
their
resources
and
the
payment
of
certain
debts
which
had
been
discovered
after
his
father
death
forced
them
whatever
pain
it
might
cost
to
seek
another
more
lowly
and
less
expensive
dwelling
they
found
a
little
flat
two
or
three
rooms
on
the
second
floor
of
a
house
in
the
market
street
it
was
a
noisy
district
in
the
middle
of
the
town
far
from
the
river
far
from
the
trees
far
from
the
country
and
all
the
familiar
places
but
they
had
to
consult
reason
not
sentiment
and
christophe
found
in
it
a
fine
opportunity
for
gratifying
his
bitter
creed
of
besides
the
owner
of
the
house
old
registrar
euler
was
a
friend
of
his
grandfather
and
knew
the
family
that
was
enough
for
louisa
who
was
lost
in
her
empty
house
and
was
irresistibly
drawn
towards
those
who
had
known
the
creatures
whom
she
had
loved
they
got
ready
to
leave
they
took
long
draughts
of
the
bitter
melancholy
of
the
last
days
passed
by
the
sad
beloved
fireside
that
was
to
be
left
forever
they
dared
hardly
tell
their
sorrow
they
were
ashamed
of
it
or
afraid
each
thought
that
they
ought
not
to
show
their
weakness
to
the
other
at
table
sitting
alone
in
a
dark
room
with
shutters
they
dared
not
raise
their
voices
they
ate
hurriedly
and
did
not
look
at
each
other
for
fear
of
not
being
able
to
conceal
their
trouble
they
parted
as
soon
as
they
had
finished
christophe
went
back
to
his
work
but
as
soon
as
he
was
free
for
a
moment
he
would
come
back
go
stealthily
home
and
creep
on
tiptoe
to
his
room
or
to
the
attic
then
he
would
shut
the
door
sit
down
in
a
corner
on
an
old
trunk
or
on
the
or
stay
there
without
thinking
letting
the
indefinable
buzzing
and
humming
of
the
old
house
which
trembled
with
the
lightest
tread
thrill
through
him
his
heart
would
tremble
with
it
he
would
listen
anxiously
for
the
faintest
breath
in
or
out
of
doors
for
the
creaking
of
floors
for
all
the
imperceptible
familiar
noises
he
knew
them
all
he
would
lose
consciousness
his
thoughts
would
be
filled
with
the
images
of
the
past
and
he
would
issue
from
his
stupor
only
at
the
sound
of
martin
clock
reminding
him
that
it
was
time
to
go
in
the
room
below
him
he
could
hear
louisa
footsteps
passing
softly
to
and
fro
then
for
hours
she
could
not
be
heard
she
made
no
noise
christophe
would
listen
intently
he
would
go
down
a
little
uneasy
as
one
is
for
a
long
time
after
a
great
misfortune
he
would
push
the
door
ajar
louisa
would
turn
her
back
on
him
she
would
be
sitting
in
front
of
a
cupboard
in
the
midst
of
a
heap
of
things
rags
old
belongings
odd
garments
treasures
which
she
had
brought
out
intending
to
sort
them
but
she
had
no
strength
for
it
everything
reminded
her
of
something
she
would
turn
and
turn
it
in
her
hands
and
begin
to
dream
it
would
drop
from
her
hands
she
would
stay
for
hours
together
with
her
arms
hanging
down
lying
back
exhausted
in
a
chair
given
up
to
a
stupor
of
sorrow
poor
louisa
was
now
spending
most
of
her
life
in
the
past
that
sad
past
which
had
been
very
niggardly
of
joy
for
her
but
she
was
so
used
to
suffering
that
she
was
still
grateful
for
the
least
tenderness
shown
to
her
and
the
pale
lights
which
had
shone
here
and
there
in
the
drab
days
of
her
life
were
still
enough
to
make
them
bright
all
the
evil
that
melchior
had
done
her
was
forgotten
she
remembered
only
the
good
her
marriage
had
been
the
great
romance
of
her
life
if
melchior
had
been
drawn
into
it
by
a
caprice
of
which
he
had
quickly
repented
she
had
given
herself
with
her
whole
heart
she
thought
that
she
was
loved
as
much
as
she
had
loved
and
to
melchior
she
was
ever
most
tenderly
grateful
she
did
not
try
to
understand
what
he
had
become
in
the
sequel
incapable
of
seeing
reality
as
it
is
she
only
knew
how
to
bear
it
as
it
is
humbly
and
honestly
as
a
woman
who
has
no
need
of
understanding
life
in
order
to
be
able
to
live
what
she
could
not
explain
she
left
to
god
for
explanation
in
her
singular
piety
she
put
upon
god
the
responsibility
for
all
the
injustice
that
she
had
suffered
at
the
hands
of
melchior
and
the
others
and
only
visited
them
with
the
good
that
they
had
given
her
and
so
her
life
of
misery
had
left
her
with
no
bitter
memory
she
only
felt
worn
out
weak
as
she
was
by
those
years
of
privation
and
fatigue
and
now
that
melchior
was
no
longer
there
now
that
two
of
her
sons
were
gone
from
their
home
and
the
third
seemed
to
be
able
to
do
without
her
she
had
lost
all
heart
for
action
she
was
tired
sleepy
her
will
was
stupefied
she
was
going
through
one
of
those
crises
of
neurasthenia
which
often
come
upon
active
and
industrious
people
in
the
decline
of
life
when
some
unforeseen
event
deprives
them
of
every
reason
for
living
she
had
not
the
heart
even
to
finish
the
stocking
she
was
knitting
to
tidy
the
drawer
in
which
she
was
looking
to
get
up
to
shut
the
window
she
would
sit
there
without
a
thought
without
strength
save
for
recollection
she
was
conscious
of
her
collapse
and
was
ashamed
of
it
or
blushed
for
it
she
tried
to
hide
it
from
her
son
and
christophe
wrapped
up
in
the
egoism
of
his
own
grief
never
noticed
it
no
doubt
he
was
often
secretly
impatient
with
his
mother
slowness
in
speaking
and
acting
and
doing
the
smallest
thing
but
different
though
her
ways
were
from
her
usual
activity
he
never
gave
a
thought
to
the
matter
until
then
suddenly
on
that
day
it
came
home
to
him
for
the
first
time
when
he
surprised
her
in
the
midst
of
her
rags
turned
out
on
the
floor
heaped
up
at
her
feet
in
her
arms
and
in
her
lap
her
neck
was
drawn
out
her
head
was
bowed
her
face
was
stiff
and
rigid
when
she
heard
him
come
in
she
started
her
white
cheeks
were
suffused
with
red
with
an
instinctive
movement
she
tried
to
hide
the
things
she
was
holding
and
muttered
with
an
awkward
smile
you
see
i
was
sorting
the
sight
of
the
poor
soul
stranded
among
the
relics
of
the
past
cut
to
his
heart
and
he
was
filled
with
pity
but
he
spoke
with
a
bitter
asperity
and
seemed
to
scold
to
drag
her
from
her
apathy
come
come
mother
you
must
not
stay
there
in
the
middle
of
all
that
dust
with
the
room
all
shut
up
it
is
not
good
for
you
you
must
pull
yourself
together
and
have
done
with
all
this
yes
said
she
meekly
she
tried
to
get
up
to
put
the
things
back
in
the
drawer
but
she
sat
down
again
at
once
and
listlessly
let
them
fall
from
her
hands
oh
i
ca
i
ca
she
moaned
i
shall
never
finish
he
was
frightened
he
leaned
over
her
he
caressed
her
forehead
with
his
hands
come
mother
what
is
it
he
said
shall
i
help
you
are
you
ill
she
did
not
answer
she
gave
a
sort
of
stifled
sob
he
took
her
hands
and
knelt
down
by
her
side
the
better
to
see
her
in
the
dusky
room
mother
he
said
anxiously
louisa
laid
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
burst
into
tears
my
boy
my
boy
she
cried
holding
close
to
him
my
boy
you
will
not
leave
me
promise
me
that
you
will
not
leave
me
his
heart
was
torn
with
pity
no
mother
no
i
will
not
leave
you
what
made
you
think
of
such
a
thing
i
am
so
unhappy
they
have
all
left
me
all
she
pointed
to
the
things
all
about
her
and
he
did
not
know
whether
she
was
speaking
of
them
or
of
her
sons
and
the
dead
you
will
stay
with
me
you
will
not
leave
me
what
should
i
do
if
you
went
too
i
will
not
go
i
tell
you
we
will
stay
together
do
cry
i
promise
she
went
on
weeping
she
could
not
stop
herself
he
dried
her
eyes
with
his
handkerchief
what
is
it
mother
dear
are
you
in
pain
i
do
know
i
do
know
what
it
is
she
tried
to
calm
herself
and
to
smile
i
do
try
to
be
sensible
i
do
but
just
nothing
at
all
makes
me
cry
you
see
i
doing
it
again

me
i
am
so
stupid
i
am
old
i
have
no
strength
left
i
have
no
taste
for
anything
any
more
i
am
no
good
for
anything
i
wish
i
were
buried
with
all
the
rest
he
held
her
to
him
close
like
a
child
do
worry
mother
be
calm
do
think
about
it
gradually
she
grew
quiet
it
is
foolish
i
am
ashamed
but
what
is
it
what
is
it
she
who
had
always
worked
so
hard
could
not
understand
why
her
strength
had
suddenly
snapped
and
she
was
humiliated
to
the
very
depths
of
her
being
he
pretended
not
to
see
it
a
little
weariness
mother
he
said
trying
to
speak
carelessly
it
is
nothing
you
will
see
it
is
nothing
but
he
too
was
anxious
from
his
childhood
he
had
been
accustomed
to
see
her
brave
resigned
in
silence
withstanding
every
test
and
he
was
astonished
to
see
her
suddenly
broken
he
was
afraid
he
helped
her
to
sort
the
things
scattered
on
the
floor
every
now
and
then
she
would
linger
over
something
but
he
would
gently
take
it
from
her
hands
and
she
suffered
him
from
that
time
on
he
took
pains
to
be
more
with
her
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
his
work
instead
of
shutting
himself
up
in
his
room
as
he
loved
to
do
he
would
return
to
her
he
felt
her
loneliness
and
that
she
was
not
strong
enough
to
be
left
alone
there
was
danger
in
leaving
her
alone
he
would
sit
by
her
side
in
the
evening
near
the
open
window
looking
on
to
the
road
the
view
would
slowly
disappear
the
people
were
returning
home
little
lights
appeared
in
the
houses
far
off
they
had
seen
it
all
a
thousand
times
but
soon
they
would
see
it
no
more
they
would
talk
disjointedly
they
would
point
out
to
each
other
the
smallest
of
the
familiar
incidents
and
expectations
of
the
evening
always
with
fresh
interest
they
would
have
long
intimate
silences
or
louisa
for
no
apparent
reason
would
tell
some
reminiscence
some
disconnected
story
that
passed
through
her
mind
her
tongue
was
loosed
a
little
now
that
she
felt
that
she
was
with
one
who
loved
her
she
tried
hard
to
talk
it
was
difficult
for
her
for
she
had
grown
used
to
living
apart
from
her
family
she
looked
upon
her
sons
and
her
husband
as
too
clever
to
talk
to
her
and
she
had
never
dared
to
join
in
their
conversation
christophe
tender
care
was
a
new
thing
to
her
and
infinitely
sweet
though
it
made
her
afraid
she
deliberated
over
her
words
she
found
it
difficult
to
express
herself
her
sentences
were
left
unfinished
and
obscure
sometimes
she
was
ashamed
of
what
she
was
saying
she
would
look
at
her
son
and
stop
in
the
middle
of
her
narrative
but
he
would
press
her
hand
and
she
would
be
reassured
he
was
filled
with
love
and
pity
for
the
childish
motherly
creature
to
whom
he
had
turned
when
he
was
a
child
and
now
she
turned
to
him
for
support
and
he
took
a
melancholy
pleasure
in
her
prattle
that
had
no
interest
for
anybody
but
himself
in
her
trivial
memories
of
a
life
that
had
always
been
joyless
and
mediocre
though
it
seemed
to
louisa
to
be
of
infinite
worth
sometimes
he
would
try
to
interrupt
her
he
was
afraid
that
her
memories
would
make
her
sadder
than
ever
and
he
would
urge
her
to
sleep
she
would
understand
what
he
was
at
and
would
say
with
gratitude
in
her
eyes
no
i
assure
you
it
does
one
good
let
us
stay
a
little
longer
they
would
stay
until
the
night
was
far
gone
and
the
neighbors
were
abed
then
they
would
say
she
a
little
comforted
by
being
rid
of
some
of
her
trouble
he
with
a
heavy
heart
under
this
new
burden
added
to
that
which
already
he
had
to
bear
the
day
came
for
their
departure
on
the
night
before
they
stayed
longer
than
usual
in
the
unlighted
room
they
did
not
speak
every
now
and
then
louisa
moaned
fear
god
fear
god
christophe
tried
to
keep
her
attention
fixed
on
the
thousand
details
of
the
morrow
removal
she
would
not
go
to
bed
until
he
gently
compelled
her
but
he
went
up
to
his
room
and
did
not
go
to
bed
for
a
long
time
when
leaning
out
of
the
window
he
tried
to
gaze
through
the
darkness
to
see
for
the
last
time
the
moving
shadows
of
the
river
beneath
the
house
he
heard
the
wind
in
the
tall
trees
in
garden
the
sky
was
black
there
was
no
one
in
the
street
a
cold
rain
was
just
falling
the
weathercocks
creaked
in
a
house
near
by
a
child
was
crying
the
night
weighed
with
an
overwhelming
heaviness
upon
the
earth
and
upon
his
soul
the
dull
chiming
of
the
hours
the
cracked
note
of
the
halves
and
quarters
dropped
one
after
another
into
the
grim
silence
broken
only
by
the
sound
of
the
rain
on
the
roofs
and
the
cobbles
when
christophe
at
last
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
bed
chilled
in
body
and
soul
he
heard
the
window
below
him
shut
and
as
he
lay
he
thought
sadly
that
it
is
cruel
for
the
poor
to
dwell
on
the
past
for
they
have
no
right
to
have
a
past
like
the
rich
they
have
no
home
no
corner
of
the
earth
wherein
to
house
their
memories
their
joys
their
sorrows
all
their
days
are
scattered
in
the
wind
next
day
in
beating
rain
they
moved
their
scanty
furniture
to
their
new
dwelling
fischer
the
old
furniture
dealer
lent
them
a
cart
and
a
pony
he
came
and
helped
them
himself
but
they
could
not
take
everything
for
the
rooms
to
which
they
were
going
were
much
smaller
than
the
old
christophe
had
to
make
his
mother
leave
the
oldest
and
most
useless
of
their
belongings
it
was
not
altogether
easy
the
least
thing
had
its
worth
for
her
a
shaky
table
a
broken
chair
she
wished
to
leave
nothing
behind
fischer
fortified
by
the
authority
of
his
old
friendship
with
jean
michel
had
to
join
christophe
in
complaining
and
that
he
was
and
understanding
her
grief
had
even
to
promise
to
keep
some
of
her
precious
rubbish
for
her
against
the
day
when
she
should
want
it
again
then
she
agreed
to
tear
herself
away
the
two
brothers
had
been
told
of
the
removal
but
ernest
came
on
the
night
before
to
say
that
he
could
not
be
there
and
rodolphe
appeared
for
a
moment
about
noon
he
watched
them
load
the
furniture
gave
some
advice
and
went
away
again
looking
mightily
busy
the
procession
set
out
through
the
muddy
streets
christophe
led
the
horse
which
slipped
on
the
greasy
cobbles
louisa
walked
by
her
son
side
and
tried
to
shelter
him
from
the
rain
and
so
they
had
a
melancholy
homecoming
in
the
damp
rooms
that
were
made
darker
than
ever
by
the
dull
light
coming
from
the
lowering
sky
they
could
not
have
fought
against
the
depression
that
was
upon
them
had
it
not
been
for
the
attentions
of
their
landlord
and
his
family
but
when
the
cart
had
driven
away
as
night
fell
leaving
the
furniture
heaped
up
in
the
room
and
christophe
and
louisa
were
sitting
worn
out
one
on
a
box
the
other
on
a
sack
they
heard
a
little
dry
cough
on
the
staircase
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
old
euler
came
in
he
begged
pardon
elaborately
for
disturbing
his
guests
and
said
that
by
way
of
celebrating
their
first
evening
he
hoped
that
they
would
be
kind
enough
to
sup
with
himself
and
his
family
louisa
stunned
by
her
sorrow
wished
to
refuse
christophe
was
not
much
more
tempted
than
she
by
this
friendly
gathering
but
the
old
man
insisted
and
christophe
thinking
that
it
would
be
better
for
his
mother
not
to
spend
their
first
evening
in
their
new
home
alone
with
her
thoughts
made
her
accept
they
went
down
to
the
floor
below
where
they
found
the
whole
family
collected
the
old
man
his
daughter
his
vogel
and
his
grandchildren
a
boy
and
a
girl
both
a
little
younger
than
christophe
they
clustered
around
their
guests
bade
them
welcome
asked
if
they
were
tired
if
they
were
pleased
with
their
rooms
if
they
needed
anything
putting
so
many
questions
that
christophe
in
bewilderment
could
make
nothing
of
them
for
everybody
spoke
at
once
the
soup
was
placed
on
the
table
they
sat
down
but
the
noise
went
on
amalia
euler
daughter
had
set
herself
at
once
to
acquaint
louisa
with
local
details
with
the
topography
of
the
district
the
habits
and
advantages
of
the
house
the
time
when
the
milkman
called
the
time
when
she
got
up
the
various
tradespeople
and
the
prices
that
she
paid
she
did
not
stop
until
she
had
explained
everything
louisa
tried
hard
to
take
an
interest
in
the
information
but
the
remarks
which
she
ventured
showed
that
she
had
understood
not
a
word
and
provoked
amalia
to
indignant
exclamations
and
repetition
of
every
detail
old
euler
a
clerk
tried
to
explain
to
christophe
the
difficulties
of
a
musical
career
christophe
other
neighbor
rosa
amalia
daughter
never
stopped
talking
from
the
moment
when
they
sat
down
so
volubly
that
she
had
no
time
to
breathe
she
lost
her
breath
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
but
at
once
she
was
off
again
vogel
was
gloomy
and
complained
of
the
food
and
there
were
embittered
arguments
on
the
subject
amalia
euler
the
girl
left
off
talking
to
take
part
in
the
discussion
and
there
were
endless
controversies
as
to
whether
there
was
too
much
salt
in
the
stew
or
not
enough
they
called
each
other
to
witness
and
naturally
no
two
opinions
were
the
same
each
despised
his
neighbor
taste
and
thought
only
his
own
healthy
and
reasonable
they
might
have
gone
on
arguing
until
the
last
judgment
but
in
the
end
they
all
joined
in
crying
out
upon
the
bad
weather
they
all
commiserated
louisa
and
christophe
upon
their
troubles
and
in
terms
which
moved
him
greatly
they
praised
him
for
his
courageous
conduct
they
took
great
pleasure
in
recalling
not
only
the
misfortunes
of
their
guests
but
also
their
own
and
those
of
their
friends
and
all
their
acquaintance
and
they
all
agreed
that
the
good
are
always
unhappy
and
that
there
is
joy
only
for
the
selfish
and
dishonest
they
decided
that
life
is
sad
that
it
is
quite
useless
and
that
they
were
all
better
dead
were
it
not
the
indubitable
will
of
god
that
they
should
go
on
living
so
as
to
suffer
all
these
ideas
came
very
near
to
christophe
actual
pessimism
he
thought
the
better
of
his
landlord
and
closed
his
eyes
to
their
little
oddities
when
he
went
upstairs
again
with
his
mother
to
the
disordered
rooms
they
were
weary
and
sad
but
they
felt
a
little
less
lonely
and
while
christophe
lay
awake
through
the
night
for
he
could
not
sleep
because
of
his
weariness
and
the
noise
of
the
neighborhood
and
listened
to
the
heavy
carts
shaking
the
walls
and
the
breathing
of
the
family
sleeping
below
he
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
he
would
be
if
not
happy
at
least
less
unhappy
here
with
these
good
people
a
little
tiresome
if
the
truth
be
told
who
suffered
from
like
misfortunes
who
seemed
to
understand
him
and
whom
he
thought
he
understood
but
when
at
last
he
did
fall
asleep
he
was
roused
unpleasantly
at
dawn
by
the
voices
of
his
neighbors
arguing
and
the
creaking
of
a
pump
worked
furiously
by
some
one
who
was
in
a
hurry
to
swill
the
yard
and
the
stairs
justus
euler
was
a
little
bent
old
man
with
uneasy
gloomy
eyes
a
red
face
all
lines
and
pimples
with
an
unkempt
beard
with
which
he
was
forever
fidgeting
with
his
hands
very
honest
quite
able
profoundly
moral
he
had
been
on
quite
good
terms
with
grandfather
he
was
said
to
be
like
him
and
in
truth
he
was
of
the
same
generation
and
brought
up
with
the
same
principles
but
he
lacked
jean
michel
strong
physique
that
is
while
he
was
of
the
same
opinion
on
many
points
fundamentally
he
was
hardly
at
all
like
him
for
it
is
temperament
far
more
than
ideas
that
makes
a
man
and
whatever
the
divisions
fictitious
or
real
marked
between
men
by
intellect
the
great
divisions
between
men
and
men
are
into
those
who
are
healthy
and
those
who
are
not
old
euler
was
not
a
healthy
man
he
talked
morality
like
jean
michel
but
his
morals
were
not
the
same
as
jean
michel
he
had
not
his
sound
stomach
his
lungs
or
his
jovial
strength
everything
in
euler
and
his
family
was
built
on
a
more
parsimonious
and
niggardly
plan
he
had
been
an
official
for
forty
years
was
now
retired
and
suffered
from
that
melancholy
that
comes
from
inactivity
and
weighs
so
heavily
upon
old
men
who
have
not
made
provision
in
their
inner
life
for
their
last
years
all
his
habits
natural
and
acquired
all
the
habits
of
his
trade
had
given
him
a
meticulous
and
peevish
quality
which
was
reproduced
to
a
certain
extent
in
each
of
his
children
his
vogel
a
clerk
at
the
chancery
court
was
fifty
years
old
tall
strong
almost
bald
with
gold
spectacles
fairly
he
considered
himself
ill
and
no
doubt
was
so
although
obviously
he
did
not
have
the
diseases
which
he
thought
he
had
but
only
a
mind
soured
by
the
stupidity
of
his
calling
and
a
body
ruined
to
a
certain
extent
by
his
sedentary
life
very
industrious
not
without
merit
even
cultured
up
to
a
point
he
was
a
victim
of
our
ridiculous
modern
life
or
like
so
many
clerks
locked
up
in
their
offices
he
had
succumbed
to
the
demon
of
hypochondria
one
of
those
unfortunates
whom
goethe
called
trauriger
ungriechischer
a
gloomy
and
hypochondriac
and
pitied
though
he
took
good
care
to
avoid
them
amalia
was
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
strong
loud
and
active
she
wasted
no
sympathy
on
her
husband
jeremiads
she
used
to
shake
him
roughly
but
no
human
strength
can
bear
up
against
living
together
and
when
in
a
household
one
or
other
is
neurasthenic
the
chances
are
that
in
time
they
will
both
be
so
in
vain
did
amalia
cry
out
upon
vogel
in
vain
did
she
go
on
protesting
either
from
habit
or
because
it
was
necessary
next
moment
she
herself
was
lamenting
her
condition
more
loudly
even
than
he
and
passing
imperceptibly
from
scolding
to
lamentation
she
did
him
no
good
she
increased
his
ills
tenfold
by
loudly
singing
chorus
to
his
follies
in
the
end
not
only
did
she
crush
the
unhappy
vogel
terrified
by
the
proportions
assumed
by
his
own
outcries
sent
sounding
back
by
this
echo
but
she
crushed
everybody
even
herself
in
her
turn
she
caught
the
trick
of
unwarrantably
bemoaning
her
health
and
her
father
and
her
daughter
and
her
son
it
became
a
mania
by
constant
repetition
she
came
to
believe
what
she
said
she
took
the
least
chill
tragically
she
was
uneasy
and
worried
about
everybody
more
than
that
when
they
were
well
she
still
worried
because
of
the
sickness
that
was
bound
to
come
so
life
was
passed
in
perpetual
fear
outside
that
they
were
all
in
fairly
good
health
and
it
seemed
as
though
their
state
of
continual
moaning
and
groaning
did
serve
to
keep
them
well
they
all
ate
and
slept
and
worked
as
usual
and
the
life
of
this
household
was
not
relaxed
for
it
all
activity
was
not
satisfied
with
working
from
morning
to
night
up
and
down
the
house
they
all
had
to
toil
with
her
and
there
was
forever
a
moving
of
furniture
a
washing
of
floors
a
polishing
of
wood
a
sound
of
voices
footsteps
quivering
movement
the
two
children
crushed
by
such
loud
authority
leaving
nobody
alone
seemed
to
find
it
natural
enough
to
submit
to
it
the
boy
leonard
was
good
looking
though
insignificant
of
feature
and
stiff
in
manner
the
girl
rosa
with
pretty
blue
eyes
gentle
and
affectionate
would
have
been
pleasing
especially
with
the
freshness
of
her
delicate
complexion
and
her
kind
manner
had
her
nose
not
been
quite
so
large
or
so
awkwardly
placed
it
made
her
face
heavy
and
gave
her
a
foolish
expression
she
was
like
a
girl
of
holbein
in
the
gallery
at
basle
the
daughter
of
burgomaster
meier
sitting
with
eyes
cast
down
her
hands
on
her
knees
her
fair
hair
falling
down
to
her
shoulders
looking
embarrassed
and
ashamed
of
her
uncomely
nose
but
so
far
rosa
had
not
been
troubled
by
it
and
it
never
had
broken
in
upon
her
inexhaustible
chatter
always
her
shrill
voice
was
heard
in
the
house
telling
stories
always
breathless
as
though
she
had
no
time
to
say
everything
always
excited
and
animated
in
spite
of
the
protests
which
she
drew
from
her
mother
her
father
and
even
her
grandfather
exasperated
not
so
much
because
she
was
forever
talking
as
because
she
prevented
them
talking
themselves
for
these
good
people
kind
loyal
devoted
the
very
cream
of
good
people
had
almost
all
the
virtues
but
they
lacked
one
virtue
which
is
capital
and
is
the
charm
of
life
the
virtue
of
silence
christophe
was
in
tolerant
mood
his
sorrow
had
softened
his
intolerant
and
emphatic
temper
his
experience
of
the
cruel
indifference
of
the
elegant
made
him
more
conscious
of
the
worth
of
these
honest
folk
graceless
and
devilish
tiresome
who
had
yet
an
austere
conception
of
life
and
because
they
lived
joylessly
seemed
to
him
to
live
without
weakness
having
decided
that
they
were
excellent
and
that
he
ought
to
like
them
like
the
german
that
he
was
he
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
he
did
in
fact
like
them
but
he
did
not
succeed
he
lacked
that
easy
germanic
idealism
which
does
not
wish
to
see
and
does
not
see
what
would
be
displeasing
to
its
sight
for
fear
of
disturbing
the
very
proper
tranquillity
of
its
judgment
and
the
pleasantness
of
its
existence
on
the
contrary
he
never
was
so
conscious
of
the
defects
of
these
people
as
when
he
loved
them
when
he
wanted
to
love
them
absolutely
without
reservation
it
was
a
sort
of
unconscious
loyalty
and
an
inexorable
demand
for
truth
which
in
spite
of
himself
made
him
more
and
more
exacting
with
what
was
dearest
to
him
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
began
to
be
irritated
by
the
oddities
of
the
family
they
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
them
contrary
to
the
usual
habit
they
displayed
every
intolerable
quality
they
possessed
and
all
the
good
in
them
was
hidden
so
christophe
told
himself
for
he
judged
himself
to
have
been
unjust
and
tried
to
surmount
his
first
impressions
and
to
discover
in
them
the
excellent
qualities
which
they
so
carefully
concealed
he
tried
to
converse
with
old
justus
euler
who
asked
nothing
better
he
had
a
secret
sympathy
with
him
remembering
that
his
grandfather
had
liked
to
praise
him
but
good
old
jean
michel
had
more
of
the
pleasant
faculty
of
deceiving
himself
about
his
friends
than
christophe
and
christophe
soon
saw
that
in
vain
did
he
try
to
accept
euler
memories
of
his
grandfather
he
could
only
get
from
him
a
discolored
caricature
of
jean
michel
and
scraps
of
talk
that
were
utterly
uninteresting
euler
stories
used
invariably
to
begin
with
as
i
used
to
say
to
your
poor
grandfather
he
could
remember
nothing
else
he
had
heard
only
what
he
had
said
himself
perhaps
jean
michel
used
only
to
listen
in
the
same
way
most
friendships
are
little
more
than
arrangements
for
mutual
satisfaction
so
that
each
party
may
talk
about
himself
to
the
other
but
at
least
jean
michel
however
naïvely
he
used
to
give
himself
up
to
the
delight
of
talking
had
sympathy
which
he
was
always
ready
to
lavish
on
all
sides
he
was
interested
in
everything
he
always
regretted
that
he
was
no
longer
fifteen
so
as
to
be
able
to
see
the
marvelous
inventions
of
the
new
generations
and
to
share
their
thoughts
he
had
the
quality
perhaps
the
most
precious
in
life
a
curiosity
always
fresh
sever
changing
with
the
years
born
anew
every
morning
he
had
not
the
talent
to
turn
this
gift
to
account
but
how
many
men
of
talent
might
envy
him
most
men
die
at
twenty
or
thirty
thereafter
they
are
only
reflections
of
themselves
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
they
are
aping
themselves
repeating
from
day
to
day
more
and
more
mechanically
and
affectedly
what
they
said
and
did
and
thought
and
loved
when
they
were
alive
it
was
so
long
since
old
euler
had
been
alive
and
he
had
been
such
a
small
thing
then
that
what
was
left
of
him
now
was
very
poor
and
rather
ridiculous
outside
his
former
trade
and
his
family
life
he
knew
nothing
and
wished
to
know
nothing
on
every
subject
he
had
ideas
dating
from
his
youth
he
pretended
to
some
knowledge
of
the
arts
but
he
clung
to
certain
hallowed
names
of
men
about
whom
he
was
forever
reiterating
his
emphatic
formulæ
everything
else
was
naught
and
had
never
been
when
modern
interests
were
mentioned
he
would
not
listen
and
talked
of
something
else
he
declared
that
he
loved
music
passionately
and
he
would
ask
christophe
to
play
but
as
soon
as
christophe
who
had
been
caught
once
or
twice
began
to
play
the
old
fellow
would
begin
to
talk
loudly
to
his
daughter
as
though
the
music
only
increased
his
interest
in
everything
but
music
christophe
would
get
up
exasperated
in
the
middle
of
his
piece
so
one
would
notice
it
there
were
only
a
few
old
airs
three
or
four
some
very
beautiful
others
very
ugly
but
all
equally
sacred
which
were
privileged
to
gain
comparative
silence
and
absolute
approval
with
the
very
first
notes
the
old
man
would
go
into
ecstasies
tears
would
come
to
his
eyes
not
so
much
for
the
pleasure
he
was
enjoying
as
for
the
pleasure
which
once
he
had
enjoyed
in
the
end
christophe
had
a
horror
of
these
airs
though
some
of
them
like
the
of
beethoven
were
very
dear
to
him
the
old
man
was
always
humming
the
first
bars
of
them
and
never
failed
to
declare
there
that
is
music
contemptuously
comparing
it
with
all
the
blessed
modern
music
in
which
there
is
no
melody
truth
to
tell
he
knew
nothing
whatever
about
it
his
was
better
educated
and
kept
in
touch
with
artistic
movements
but
that
was
even
worse
for
in
his
judgment
there
was
always
a
disparaging
tinge
he
was
lacking
neither
in
taste
nor
intelligence
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
admire
anything
modern
he
would
have
disparaged
mozart
and
beethoven
if
they
had
been
contemporary
just
as
he
would
have
acknowledged
the
merits
of
wagner
and
richard
strauss
had
they
been
dead
for
a
century
his
discontented
temper
refused
to
allow
that
there
might
be
great
men
living
during
his
own
lifetime
the
idea
was
distasteful
to
him
he
was
so
embittered
by
his
wasted
life
that
he
insisted
on
pretending
that
every
life
was
wasted
that
it
could
not
be
otherwise
and
that
those
who
thought
the
opposite
or
pretended
to
think
so
were
one
of
two
things
fools
or
humbugs
and
so
he
never
spoke
of
any
new
celebrity
except
in
a
tone
of
bitter
irony
and
as
he
was
not
stupid
he
never
failed
to
discover
at
the
first
glance
the
weak
or
ridiculous
sides
of
them
any
new
name
roused
him
to
distrust
before
he
knew
anything
about
the
man
he
was
inclined
to
criticise
him
because
he
knew
nothing
about
him
if
he
was
sympathetic
towards
christophe
it
was
because
he
thought
that
the
misanthropic
boy
found
life
as
evil
as
he
did
himself
and
that
he
was
not
a
genius
nothing
so
unites
the
small
of
soul
in
their
suffering
and
discontent
as
the
statement
of
their
common
impotence
nothing
so
much
restores
the
desire
for
health
or
life
to
those
who
are
healthy
and
made
for
the
joy
of
life
as
contact
with
the
stupid
pessimism
of
the
mediocre
and
the
sick
who
because
they
are
not
happy
deny
the
happiness
of
others
christophe
felt
this
and
yet
these
gloomy
thoughts
were
familiar
to
him
but
he
was
surprised
to
find
them
on
vogel
lips
where
they
were
unrecognizable
more
than
that
they
were
repugnant
to
him
they
offended
him
he
was
even
more
in
revolt
against
amalia
ways
the
good
creature
did
no
more
than
practise
christophe
theories
of
duty
the
word
was
upon
her
lips
at
every
turn
she
worked
unceasingly
and
wanted
everybody
to
work
as
she
did
her
work
was
never
directed
towards
making
herself
and
others
happier
on
the
contrary
it
almost
seemed
as
though
it
was
mainly
intended
to
incommode
everybody
and
to
make
life
as
disagreeable
as
possible
so
as
to
sanctify
it
nothing
would
induce
her
for
a
moment
to
relinquish
her
holy
duties
in
the
household
that
institution
which
in
so
many
women
takes
the
place
of
all
other
duties
social
and
moral
she
would
have
thought
herself
lost
had
she
not
on
the
same
day
at
the
same
time
polished
the
wooden
floors
washed
the
tiles
cleaned
the
beaten
the
carpets
moved
the
chairs
the
cupboards
the
tables
she
was
ostentatious
about
it
it
was
as
though
it
was
a
point
of
honor
with
her
and
after
all
is
it
not
in
much
the
same
spirit
that
many
women
conceive
and
defend
their
honor
it
is
a
sort
of
piece
of
furniture
which
they
have
to
keep
polished
a
well
waxed
floor
cold
hard
and
slippery
the
accomplishment
of
her
task
did
not
make
frau
vogel
more
amicable
she
sacrificed
herself
to
the
trivialities
of
the
household
as
to
a
duty
imposed
by
god
and
she
despised
those
who
did
not
do
as
she
did
those
who
rested
and
were
able
to
enjoy
life
a
little
in
the
intervals
of
work
she
would
go
and
rouse
louisa
in
her
room
when
from
time
to
time
she
sat
down
in
the
middle
of
her
work
to
dream
louisa
would
sigh
but
she
submitted
to
it
with
a
smile
fortunately
christophe
knew
nothing
about
it
amalia
used
to
wait
until
he
had
gone
out
before
she
made
these
irruptions
into
their
rooms
and
so
far
she
had
not
directly
attacked
him
he
would
not
have
put
up
with
it
when
he
was
with
her
he
was
conscious
of
a
latent
hostility
within
himself
what
he
could
least
forgive
her
was
the
noise
she
made
he
was
maddened
by
it
when
he
was
locked
in
his
room
a
little
low
room
looking
out
on
the
yard
with
the
window
hermetically
sealed
in
spite
of
the
want
of
air
so
as
not
to
hear
the
clatter
in
the
house
he
could
not
escape
from
it
involuntarily
he
was
forced
to
listen
attentively
for
the
least
sound
coming
up
from
below
and
when
the
terrible
voice
which
penetrated
all
the
walls
broke
out
again
after
a
moment
of
silence
he
was
filled
with
rage
he
would
shout
stamp
with
his
foot
and
roar
insults
at
her
through
the
wall
in
the
general
uproars
no
one
ever
noticed
it
they
thought
he
was
composing
he
would
consign
frau
vogel
to
the
depths
of
hell
he
had
no
respect
for
her
nor
esteem
to
check
him
at
such
times
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
would
have
preferred
the
loosest
and
most
stupid
of
women
if
only
she
did
not
talk
to
cleverness
honesty
all
the
virtues
when
they
make
too
much
noise
his
hatred
of
noise
brought
him
in
touch
with
leonard
in
the
midst
of
the
general
excitement
the
boy
was
the
only
one
to
keep
calm
and
never
to
raise
his
voice
more
at
one
moment
than
another
he
always
expressed
himself
correctly
and
deliberately
choosing
his
words
and
never
hurrying
amalia
simmering
never
had
patience
to
wait
until
he
had
finished
the
whole
family
cried
out
upon
his
slowness
he
did
not
worry
about
it
nothing
could
upset
his
calm
respectful
deference
christophe
was
the
more
attracted
to
him
when
he
learned
that
leonard
intended
to
devote
his
life
to
the
church
and
his
curiosity
was
roused
with
regard
to
religion
christophe
was
in
a
queer
position
he
did
not
know
himself
how
he
stood
towards
it
he
had
never
had
time
to
think
seriously
about
it
he
was
not
well
enough
educated
and
he
was
too
much
absorbed
by
the
difficulties
of
existence
to
be
able
to
analyze
himself
and
to
set
his
ideas
in
order
his
violence
led
him
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
from
absolute
facts
to
complete
negation
without
troubling
to
find
out
whether
in
either
case
he
agreed
with
himself
when
he
was
happy
he
hardly
thought
of
god
at
all
but
he
was
quite
ready
to
believe
in
him
when
he
was
unhappy
he
thought
of
him
but
did
not
believe
it
seemed
to
him
impossible
that
a
god
could
authorize
unhappiness
and
injustice
but
these
difficulties
did
not
greatly
exercise
him
he
was
too
fundamentally
religious
to
think
much
about
god
he
lived
in
god
he
had
no
need
to
believe
in
him
that
is
well
enough
for
the
weak
and
worn
for
those
whose
lives
are
anæmic
they
aspire
to
god
as
a
plant
does
to
the
sun
the
dying
cling
to
life
but
he
who
bears
in
his
soul
the
sun
and
life
what
need
has
he
to
seek
them
outside
himself
christophe
would
probably
never
have
bothered
about
these
questions
had
he
lived
alone
but
the
obligations
of
social
life
forced
him
to
bring
his
thoughts
to
bear
on
these
puerile
and
useless
problems
which
occupy
a
place
out
of
all
proportion
in
the
world
it
is
impossible
not
to
take
them
into
account
since
at
every
step
they
are
in
the
way
as
if
a
healthy
generous
creature
overflowing
with
strength
and
love
had
not
a
thousand
more
worthy
things
to
do
than
to
worry
as
to
whether
god
exists
or
no
if
it
were
only
a
question
of
believing
in
god
but
it
is
needful
to
believe
in
god
of
whatever
shape
or
size
and
color
and
race
so
far
christophe
never
gave
a
thought
to
the
matter
jesus
hardly
occupied
his
thoughts
at
all
it
was
not
that
he
did
not
love
him
he
loved
him
when
he
thought
of
him
but
he
never
thought
of
him
sometimes
he
reproached
himself
for
it
was
angry
with
himself
could
not
understand
why
he
did
not
take
more
interest
in
him
and
yet
he
professed
all
his
family
professed
his
grandfather
was
forever
reading
the
bible
he
went
regularly
to
mass
he
served
it
in
a
sort
of
way
for
he
was
an
organist
and
he
set
about
his
task
conscientiously
and
in
an
exemplary
manner
but
when
he
left
the
church
he
would
have
been
hard
put
to
it
to
say
what
he
had
been
thinking
about
he
set
himself
to
read
the
holy
books
in
order
to
fix
his
ideas
and
he
found
amusement
and
even
pleasure
in
them
just
as
in
any
beautiful
strange
books
not
essentially
different
from
other
books
which
no
one
ever
thinks
of
calling
sacred
in
truth
if
jesus
appealed
to
him
beethoven
did
no
less
and
at
his
organ
in
saint
florian
church
where
he
accompanied
on
sundays
he
was
more
taken
up
with
his
organ
than
with
mass
and
he
was
more
religious
when
he
played
bach
than
when
he
played
mendelssohn
some
of
the
ritual
brought
him
to
a
fervor
of
exaltation
but
did
he
then
love
god
or
was
it
only
the
music
as
an
impudent
priest
said
to
him
one
day
in
jest
without
thinking
of
the
unhappiness
which
his
quip
might
cause
in
him
anybody
else
would
not
have
paid
any
attention
to
it
and
would
not
have
changed
his
mode
of
living
so
many
people
put
up
with
not
knowing
what
they
think
but
christophe
was
cursed
with
an
awkward
need
for
sincerity
which
filled
him
with
scruples
at
every
turn
and
when
scruples
came
to
him
they
possessed
him
forever
he
tortured
himself
he
thought
that
he
had
acted
with
duplicity
did
he
believe
or
did
he
not
he
had
no
means
material
or
intellectual
knowledge
and
leisure
are
necessary
of
solving
the
problem
by
himself
and
yet
it
had
to
be
solved
or
he
was
either
indifferent
or
a
hypocrite
now
he
was
incapable
of
being
either
one
or
the
other
he
tried
timidly
to
sound
those
about
him
they
all
seemed
to
be
sure
of
themselves
christophe
burned
to
know
their
reasons
he
could
not
discover
them
hardly
did
he
receive
a
definite
answer
they
always
talked
obliquely
some
thought
him
arrogant
and
said
that
there
is
no
arguing
these
things
that
thousands
of
men
cleverer
and
better
than
himself
had
believed
without
argument
and
that
he
needed
only
to
do
as
they
had
done
there
were
some
who
were
a
little
hurt
as
though
it
were
a
personal
affront
to
ask
them
such
a
question
and
yet
they
were
of
all
perhaps
the
least
certain
of
their
facts
others
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
said
with
a
smile
bah
it
ca
do
any
harm
and
their
smile
said
and
it
is
so
useful
christophe
despised
them
with
all
his
heart
he
had
tried
to
lay
his
uncertainties
before
a
priest
but
he
was
discouraged
by
the
experiment
he
could
not
discuss
the
matter
seriously
with
him
though
his
interlocution
was
quite
pleasant
he
made
christophe
feel
quite
politely
that
there
was
no
real
equality
between
them
he
seemed
to
assume
in
advance
that
his
superiority
was
beyond
dispute
and
that
the
discussion
could
not
exceed
the
limits
which
he
laid
down
for
it
without
a
kind
of
impropriety
it
was
just
a
fencing
bout
and
was
quite
inoffensive
when
christophe
wished
to
exceed
the
limits
and
to
ask
questions
which
the
worthy
man
was
pleased
not
to
answer
he
stepped
back
with
a
patronizing
smile
and
a
few
latin
quotations
and
a
fatherly
objurgation
to
pray
pray
that
god
would
enlighten
him
christophe
issued
from
the
interview
humiliated
and
wounded
by
his
love
of
polite
superiority
wrong
or
right
he
would
never
again
for
anything
in
the
world
have
recourse
to
a
priest
he
admitted
that
these
men
were
his
superiors
in
intelligence
or
by
reason
of
their
sacred
calling
but
in
argument
there
is
neither
superiority
nor
inferiority
nor
title
nor
age
nor
name
nothing
is
of
worth
but
truth
before
which
all
men
are
equal
so
he
was
glad
to
find
a
boy
of
his
own
age
who
believed
he
asked
no
more
than
belief
and
he
hoped
that
leonard
would
give
him
good
reason
for
believing
he
made
advances
to
him
leonard
replied
with
his
usual
gentleness
but
without
eagerness
he
was
never
eager
about
anything
as
they
could
not
carry
on
a
long
conversation
in
the
house
without
being
interrupted
every
moment
by
amalia
or
the
old
man
christophe
proposed
that
they
should
go
for
a
walk
one
evening
after
dinner
leonard
was
too
polite
to
refuse
although
he
would
gladly
have
got
out
of
it
for
his
indolent
nature
disliked
walking
talking
and
anything
that
cost
him
an
effort
christophe
had
some
difficulty
in
opening
up
the
conversation
after
two
or
three
awkward
sentences
about
trivialities
he
plunged
with
a
brusqueness
that
was
almost
brutal
he
asked
leonard
if
he
were
really
going
to
be
a
priest
and
if
he
liked
the
idea
leonard
was
nonplussed
and
looked
at
him
uneasily
but
when
he
saw
that
christophe
was
not
hostilely
disposed
he
was
reassured
yes
he
replied
how
could
it
be
otherwise
ah
said
christophe
you
are
very
happy
leonard
was
conscious
of
a
shade
of
envy
in
christophe
voice
and
was
agreeably
flattered
by
it
he
altered
his
manner
became
expansive
his
face
brightened
yes
he
said
i
am
happy
he
beamed
what
do
you
do
to
be
so
asked
christophe
before
replying
leonard
proposed
that
they
should
sit
down
on
a
quiet
seat
in
the
cloisters
of
martin
from
there
they
could
see
a
corner
of
the
little
square
planted
with
acacias
and
beyond
it
the
town
the
country
bathed
in
the
evening
mists
the
rhine
flowed
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
an
old
deserted
cemetery
with
graves
lost
under
the
rich
grass
lay
in
slumber
beside
them
behind
the
closed
gates
leonard
began
to
talk
he
said
with
his
eyes
shining
with
contentment
how
happy
he
was
to
escape
from
life
to
have
found
a
refuge
where
a
man
is
and
forever
will
be
in
shelter
christophe
still
sore
from
his
wounds
felt
passionately
the
desire
for
rest
and
forgetfulness
but
it
was
mingled
with
regret
he
asked
with
a
sigh
and
yet
does
it
cost
you
nothing
to
renounce
life
altogether
oh
said
leonard
quietly
what
is
there
to
regret
is
life
sad
and
ugly
there
are
lovely
things
too
said
christophe
looking
at
the
beautiful
evening
there
are
some
beautiful
things
but
very
few
the
few
that
there
are
are
yet
many
to
me
oh
well
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
common
sense
on
the
one
hand
a
little
good
and
much
evil
on
the
other
neither
good
nor
evil
on
earth
and
after
infinite
happiness
how
can
one
hesitate
christophe
was
not
very
pleased
with
this
sort
of
arithmetic
so
economic
a
life
seemed
to
him
very
poor
but
he
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
it
was
wisdom
so
he
asked
a
little
ironically
there
is
no
risk
of
your
being
seduced
by
an
hour
pleasure
how
foolish
when
you
know
that
it
is
only
an
hour
and
that
after
it
there
is
all
eternity
you
are
quite
certain
of
eternity
of
course
christophe
questioned
him
he
was
thrilled
with
hope
and
desire
perhaps
leonard
would
at
last
give
him
impregnable
reasons
for
believing
with
what
a
passion
he
would
himself
renounce
all
the
world
to
follow
him
to
god
at
first
leonard
proud
of
his
rôle
of
apostle
and
convinced
that
christophe
doubts
were
only
a
matter
of
form
and
that
they
would
of
course
give
way
before
his
first
arguments
relied
upon
the
holy
books
the
authority
of
the
gospel
the
miracles
and
traditions
but
he
began
to
grow
gloomy
when
after
christophe
had
listened
for
a
few
minutes
he
stopped
him
and
said
that
he
was
answering
questions
with
questions
and
that
he
had
not
asked
him
to
tell
exactly
what
it
was
that
he
was
doubting
but
to
give
some
means
of
resolving
his
doubts
leonard
then
had
to
realize
that
christophe
was
much
more
ill
than
he
seemed
and
that
he
would
only
allow
himself
to
be
convinced
by
the
light
of
reason
but
he
still
thought
that
christophe
was
playing
the
free
thinker
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
be
so
sincerely
he
was
not
discouraged
and
strong
in
his
recently
acquired
knowledge
he
turned
back
to
his
school
learning
he
unfolded
higgledy
piggledy
with
more
authority
than
order
his
metaphysical
proofs
of
the
existence
of
god
and
the
immortality
of
the
soul
christophe
with
his
mind
at
stretch
and
his
brow
knit
in
the
effort
labored
in
silence
and
made
him
say
it
all
over
again
tried
hard
to
gather
the
meaning
and
to
take
it
to
himself
and
to
follow
the
reasoning
then
suddenly
he
burst
out
vowed
that
leonard
was
laughing
at
him
that
it
was
all
tricks
jests
of
the
fine
talkers
who
forged
words
and
then
amused
themselves
with
pretending
that
these
words
were
things
leonard
was
nettled
and
guaranteed
the
good
faith
of
his
authors
christophe
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
with
an
oath
that
they
were
only
humbugs
infernal
writers
and
he
demanded
fresh
proof
leonard
perceived
to
his
horror
that
christophe
was
incurably
attainted
and
took
no
more
interest
in
him
he
remembered
that
he
had
been
told
not
to
waste
his
time
in
arguing
with
skeptics
at
least
when
they
stubbornly
refuse
to
believe
there
was
the
risk
of
being
shaken
himself
without
profiting
the
other
it
was
better
to
leave
the
unfortunate
fellow
to
the
will
of
god
who
if
he
so
designs
would
see
to
it
that
the
skeptic
was
enlightened
or
if
not
who
would
dare
to
go
against
the
will
of
god
leonard
did
not
insist
then
on
carrying
on
the
discussion
he
only
said
gently
that
for
the
time
being
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
that
no
reasoning
could
show
the
way
to
a
man
who
was
determined
not
to
see
it
and
that
must
pray
and
appeal
to
grace
nothing
is
possible
without
that
he
must
desire
grace
and
the
will
to
believe
the
will
thought
christophe
bitterly
so
then
god
will
exist
because
i
will
him
to
exist
so
then
death
will
not
exist
because
it
pleases
me
to
deny
it
alas
how
easy
life
is
to
those
who
have
no
need
to
see
the
truth
to
those
who
can
see
what
they
wish
to
see
and
are
forever
forging
pleasant
dreams
in
which
softly
to
sleep
in
such
a
bed
christophe
knew
well
that
be
would
never
sleep
leonard
went
on
talking
he
had
fallen
back
on
his
favorite
subject
the
sweets
of
the
contemplative
life
and
once
on
this
neutral
ground
he
was
inexhaustible
in
his
monotonous
voice
that
shook
with
the
pleasure
in
him
he
told
of
the
joys
of
the
life
in
god
outside
above
the
world
far
from
noise
of
which
he
spoke
in
a
sudden
tone
of
hatred
he
detested
it
almost
as
much
as
christophe
far
from
violence
far
from
frivolity
far
from
the
little
miseries
that
one
has
to
suffer
every
day
in
the
warm
secure
nest
of
faith
from
which
you
can
contemplate
in
peace
the
wretchedness
of
a
strange
and
distant
world
and
as
christophe
listened
he
perceived
the
egoism
of
that
faith
leonard
saw
that
he
hurriedly
explained
the
contemplative
life
was
not
a
lazy
life
on
the
contrary
a
man
is
more
active
in
prayer
than
in
action
what
would
the
world
be
without
prayer
you
expiate
the
sins
of
others
you
bear
the
burden
of
their
misdeeds
you
offer
up
your
talents
you
intercede
between
the
world
and
god
christophe
listened
in
silence
with
increasing
hostility
he
was
conscious
of
the
hypocrisy
of
such
renunciation
in
leonard
he
was
not
unjust
enough
to
assume
hypocrisy
in
all
those
who
believe
he
knew
well
that
with
a
few
such
abdication
of
life
comes
from
the
impossibility
of
living
from
a
bitter
despair
an
appeal
to
death
that
with
still
fewer
it
is
an
ecstasy
of
passion
how
long
does
it
last
but
with
the
majority
of
men
is
it
not
too
often
the
cold
reasoning
of
souls
more
busied
with
their
own
ease
and
peace
than
with
the
happiness
of
others
or
with
truth
and
if
sincere
men
are
conscious
of
it
how
much
they
must
suffer
by
such
profanation
of
their
ideal
leonard
was
quite
happy
and
now
set
forth
the
beauty
and
harmony
of
the
world
seen
from
the
loftiness
of
the
divine
roost
below
all
was
dark
unjust
sorrowful
seen
from
on
high
it
all
became
clear
luminous
ordered
the
world
was
like
the
works
of
a
clock
perfectly
ordered
now
christophe
only
listened
absently
he
was
asking
himself
does
he
believe
or
does
he
believe
that
he
believes
and
yet
his
own
faith
his
own
passionate
desire
for
faith
was
not
shaken
not
the
mediocrity
of
soul
and
the
poverty
of
argument
of
a
fool
like
leonard
could
touch
that
night
came
down
over
the
town
the
seat
on
which
they
were
sitting
was
in
darkness
the
stars
shone
out
a
white
mist
came
up
from
the
river
the
crickets
chirped
under
the
trees
in
the
cemetery
the
bells
began
to
ring
first
the
highest
of
them
alone
like
a
plaintive
bird
challenging
the
sky
then
the
second
a
third
lower
joined
in
its
plaint
at
last
came
the
deepest
on
the
fifth
and
seemed
to
answer
them
the
three
voices
were
merged
in
each
other
at
the
bottom
of
the
towers
there
was
a
buzzing
as
of
a
gigantic
hive
of
bees
the
air
and
the
boy
heart
quivered
christophe
held
his
breath
and
thought
how
poor
was
the
music
of
musicians
compared
with
such
an
ocean
of
music
with
all
the
sounds
of
thousands
of
creatures
the
former
the
free
world
of
sounds
compared
with
the
world
tamed
catalogued
coldly
labeled
by
human
intelligence
he
sank
and
sank
into
that
sonorous
and
immense
world
without
continents
or
bounds
and
when
the
great
murmuring
had
died
away
when
the
air
had
ceased
at
last
to
quiver
christophe
woke
up
he
looked
about
him
startled
he
knew
nothing
around
him
and
in
him
everything
was
changed
there
was
no
god
as
with
faith
so
the
loss
of
faith
is
often
equally
a
flood
of
grace
a
sudden
light
reason
counts
for
nothing
the
smallest
thing
is
enough
a
word
silence
the
sound
of
bells
a
man
walks
dreams
expects
nothing
suddenly
the
world
crumbles
away
all
about
him
is
in
ruins
he
is
alone
he
no
longer
believes
christophe
was
terrified
and
could
not
understand
how
it
had
come
about
it
was
like
the
flooding
of
a
river
in
the
spring
leonard
voice
was
still
sounding
more
monotonous
than
the
voice
of
a
cricket
christophe
did
not
hear
it
he
heard
nothing
night
was
fully
come
leonard
stopped
surprised
to
find
christophe
motionless
uneasy
because
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
he
suggested
that
they
should
go
home
christophe
did
not
reply
leonard
took
his
arm
christophe
trembled
and
looked
at
leonard
with
wild
eyes
christophe
we
must
go
home
said
leonard
go
to
hell
cried
christophe
furiously
oh
christophe
what
have
i
done
asked
leonard
tremulously
he
was
dumfounded
christophe
came
to
himself
yes
you
are
right
he
said
more
gently
i
do
not
know
what
i
saying
go
to
god
go
to
god
he
was
alone
he
was
in
bitter
distress
ah
my
god
my
god
he
cried
wringing
his
hands
passionately
raising
his
face
to
the
dark
sky
why
do
i
no
longer
believe
why
can
i
believe
no
more
what
has
happened
to
me
the
disproportion
between
the
wreck
of
his
faith
and
the
conversation
that
he
had
just
had
with
leonard
was
too
great
it
was
obvious
that
the
conversation
had
no
more
brought
it
about
than
that
the
boisterousness
of
amalia
gabble
and
the
pettiness
of
the
people
with
whom
he
lived
were
not
the
cause
of
the
upheaval
which
for
some
days
had
been
taking
place
in
his
moral
resolutions
these
were
only
pretexts
the
uneasiness
had
not
come
from
without
it
was
within
himself
he
felt
stirring
in
his
heart
monstrous
and
unknown
things
and
he
dared
not
rely
on
his
thoughts
to
face
the
evil
the
evil
was
it
evil
a
languor
an
intoxication
a
voluptuous
agony
filled
all
his
being
he
was
no
longer
master
of
himself
in
vain
he
sought
to
fortify
himself
with
his
former
stoicism
his
whole
being
crashed
down
he
had
a
sudden
consciousness
of
the
vast
world
burning
wild
a
world
immeasurable
how
it
swallows
up
god
only
for
a
moment
but
the
whole
balance
of
his
old
life
was
in
that
moment
destroyed
there
was
only
one
person
in
the
family
to
whom
christophe
paid
no
attention
this
was
little
rosa
she
was
not
beautiful
and
christophe
who
was
far
from
beautiful
himself
was
very
exacting
of
beauty
in
others
he
had
that
calm
cruelty
of
youth
for
which
a
woman
does
not
exist
if
she
be
ugly
unless
she
has
passed
the
age
for
inspiring
tenderness
and
there
is
then
no
need
to
feel
for
her
anything
but
grave
peaceful
and
sentiments
rosa
also
was
not
distinguished
by
any
especial
gift
although
she
was
not
without
intelligence
and
she
was
cursed
with
a
chattering
tongue
which
drove
christophe
from
her
and
he
had
never
taken
the
trouble
to
know
her
thinking
that
there
was
in
her
nothing
to
know
and
the
most
he
ever
did
was
to
glance
at
her
but
she
was
of
better
stuff
than
most
girls
she
was
certainly
better
than
minna
whom
he
had
so
loved
she
was
a
good
girl
no
coquette
not
at
all
vain
and
until
christophe
came
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
that
she
was
plain
or
if
it
had
it
had
not
worried
her
for
none
of
her
family
bothered
about
it
whenever
her
grandfather
or
her
mother
told
her
so
out
of
a
desire
to
grumble
she
only
laughed
she
did
not
believe
it
or
she
attached
no
importance
to
it
nor
did
they
so
many
others
just
as
plain
and
more
had
found
some
one
to
love
them
the
germans
are
very
mildly
indulgent
to
physical
imperfections
they
can
not
see
them
they
are
even
able
to
embellish
them
by
virtue
of
an
easy
imagination
which
finds
unexpected
qualities
in
the
face
of
their
desire
to
make
them
like
the
most
illustrious
examples
of
human
beauty
old
euler
would
not
have
needed
much
urging
to
make
him
declare
that
his
granddaughter
had
the
nose
of
the
juno
ludovisi
happily
he
was
too
grumpy
to
pay
compliments
and
rosa
unconcerned
about
the
shape
of
her
nose
had
no
vanity
except
in
the
accomplishment
with
all
the
ritual
of
the
famous
household
duties
she
had
accepted
as
gospel
all
that
she
had
been
taught
she
hardly
ever
went
out
and
she
had
very
little
standard
of
comparison
she
admired
her
family
naïvely
and
believed
what
they
said
she
was
of
an
expansive
and
confiding
nature
easily
satisfied
and
tried
to
fall
in
with
the
mournfulness
of
her
home
and
docilely
used
to
repeat
the
pessimistic
ideas
which
she
heard
she
was
a
creature
of
devotion
always
thinking
of
others
trying
to
please
sharing
anxieties
guessing
at
what
others
wanted
she
had
a
great
need
of
loving
without
demanding
anything
in
return
naturally
her
family
took
advantage
of
her
although
they
were
kind
and
loved
her
but
there
is
always
a
temptation
to
take
advantage
of
the
love
of
those
who
are
absolutely
delivered
into
your
hands
her
family
were
so
sure
of
her
attentions
that
they
were
not
at
all
grateful
for
them
whatever
she
did
they
expected
more
and
then
she
was
clumsy
she
was
awkward
and
hasty
her
movements
were
jerky
and
boyish
she
had
outbursts
of
tenderness
which
used
to
end
in
disaster
a
broken
glass
a
jug
upset
a
door
slammed
to
things
which
let
loose
upon
her
the
wrath
of
everybody
in
the
house
she
was
always
being
snubbed
and
would
go
and
weep
in
a
corner
her
tears
did
not
last
long
she
would
soon
smile
again
and
begin
to
chatter
without
a
suspicion
of
rancor
against
anybody
christophe
advent
was
an
important
event
in
her
life
she
had
often
heard
of
him
christophe
had
some
place
in
the
gossip
of
the
town
he
was
a
sort
of
little
local
celebrity
his
name
used
often
to
recur
in
the
family
conversation
especially
when
old
jean
michel
was
alive
who
proud
of
his
grandson
used
to
sing
his
praises
to
all
of
his
acquaintance
rosa
had
seen
the
young
musician
once
or
twice
at
concerts
when
she
heard
that
he
was
coming
to
live
with
them
she
clapped
her
hands
she
was
sternly
rebuked
for
her
breach
of
manners
and
became
confused
she
saw
no
harm
in
it
in
a
life
so
monotonous
as
hers
a
new
lodger
was
a
great
distraction
she
spent
the
last
few
days
before
his
arrival
in
a
fever
of
expectancy
she
was
fearful
lest
he
should
not
like
the
house
and
she
tried
hard
to
make
every
room
as
attractive
as
possible
on
the
morning
of
his
arrival
she
even
put
a
little
bunch
of
flowers
on
the
mantelpiece
to
bid
him
welcome
as
to
herself
she
took
no
care
at
all
to
look
her
best
and
one
glance
was
enough
to
make
christophe
decide
that
she
was
plain
and
slovenly
dressed
she
did
not
think
the
same
of
him
though
she
had
good
reason
to
do
so
for
christophe
busy
exhausted
was
even
more
ugly
than
usual
but
rosa
who
was
incapable
of
thinking
the
least
ill
of
anybody
rosa
who
thought
her
grandfather
her
father
and
her
mother
all
perfectly
beautiful
saw
christophe
exactly
as
she
had
expected
to
see
him
and
admired
him
with
all
her
heart
she
was
frightened
at
sitting
next
to
him
at
table
and
unfortunately
her
shyness
took
the
shape
of
a
flood
of
words
which
at
once
alienated
christophe
sympathies
she
did
not
see
this
and
that
first
evening
remained
a
shining
memory
in
her
life
when
she
was
alone
in
her
room
after
they
had
all
gone
upstairs
she
heard
the
tread
of
the
new
lodgers
as
they
walked
over
her
head
and
the
sound
of
it
ran
joyously
through
her
the
house
seemed
to
her
to
taken
new
life
the
next
morning
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
looked
at
herself
in
the
mirror
carefully
and
uneasily
and
without
exactly
knowing
the
extent
of
her
misfortune
she
began
to
be
conscious
of
it
she
tried
to
decide
about
her
features
one
by
one
but
she
could
not
she
was
filled
with
sadness
and
apprehension
she
sighed
deeply
and
thought
of
introducing
certain
changes
in
her
toilet
but
she
only
made
herself
look
still
more
plain
she
conceived
the
unlucky
idea
of
overwhelming
christophe
with
her
kindness
in
her
naïve
desire
to
be
always
seeing
her
new
friends
and
doing
them
service
she
was
forever
going
up
and
down
the
stairs
bringing
them
some
utterly
useless
thing
insisting
on
helping
them
and
always
laughing
and
talking
and
shouting
her
zeal
and
her
stream
of
talk
could
only
be
interrupted
by
her
mother
impatient
voice
calling
her
christophe
looked
grim
but
for
his
good
resolutions
he
must
have
lost
his
temper
quite
twenty
times
he
restrained
himself
for
two
days
on
the
third
he
locked
his
door
rosa
knocked
called
understood
went
downstairs
in
dismay
and
did
not
try
again
when
he
saw
her
he
explained
that
he
was
very
busy
and
could
not
be
disturbed
she
humbly
begged
his
pardon
she
could
not
deceive
herself
as
to
the
failure
of
her
innocent
advances
they
had
accomplished
the
opposite
of
her
intention
they
had
alienated
christophe
he
no
longer
took
the
trouble
to
conceal
his
he
did
not
listen
when
she
talked
and
did
not
disguise
his
impatience
she
felt
that
her
chatter
irritated
him
and
by
force
of
will
she
succeeded
in
keeping
silent
for
a
part
of
the
evening
but
the
thing
was
stronger
than
herself
suddenly
she
would
break
out
again
and
her
words
would
tumble
over
each
other
more
tumultuously
than
ever
christophe
would
leave
her
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
she
was
not
angry
with
him
she
was
angry
with
herself
she
thought
herself
stupid
tiresome
ridiculous
all
her
faults
assumed
enormous
proportions
and
she
tried
to
wrestle
with
them
but
she
was
discouraged
by
the
check
upon
her
first
attempts
and
said
to
herself
that
she
could
not
do
it
that
she
was
not
strong
enough
but
she
would
try
again
but
there
were
other
faults
against
which
she
was
powerless
what
could
she
do
against
her
plainness
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
the
certainty
of
her
misfortune
had
suddenly
been
revealed
to
her
one
day
when
she
was
looking
at
herself
in
the
mirror
it
came
like
a
thunderclap
of
course
she
exaggerated
the
evil
and
saw
her
nose
as
ten
times
larger
than
it
was
it
seemed
to
her
to
fill
all
her
face
she
dared
not
show
herself
she
wished
to
die
but
there
is
in
youth
such
a
power
of
hope
that
these
fits
of
discouragement
never
lasted
long
she
would
end
by
pretending
that
she
had
been
mistaken
she
would
try
to
believe
it
and
for
a
moment
or
two
would
actually
succeed
in
thinking
her
nose
quite
ordinary
and
almost
shapely
her
instinct
made
her
attempt
though
very
clumsily
certain
childish
tricks
a
way
of
doing
her
hair
so
as
not
so
much
to
show
her
forehead
and
so
accentuate
the
disproportion
of
her
face
and
yet
there
was
no
coquetry
in
her
no
thought
of
love
had
crossed
her
mind
or
she
was
unconscious
of
it
she
asked
little
nothing
but
a
little
friendship
but
christophe
did
not
show
any
inclination
to
give
her
that
little
it
seemed
to
rosa
that
she
would
have
been
perfectly
happy
had
he
only
condescended
to
say
when
they
met
a
friendly
with
a
little
kindness
but
christophe
usually
looked
so
hard
and
so
cold
it
chilled
her
he
never
said
anything
disagreeable
to
her
but
she
would
rather
have
had
cruel
reproaches
than
such
cruel
silence
one
evening
christophe
was
playing
his
piano
he
had
taken
up
his
quarters
in
a
little
attic
at
the
top
of
the
house
so
as
not
to
be
so
much
disturbed
by
the
noise
downstairs
rosa
was
listening
to
him
deeply
moved
she
loved
music
though
her
taste
was
bad
and
unformed
while
her
mother
was
there
she
stayed
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
bent
over
her
sewing
apparently
absorbed
in
her
work
but
her
heart
was
with
the
sounds
coming
from
upstairs
and
she
wished
to
miss
nothing
as
soon
as
amalia
went
out
for
a
walk
in
the
neighborhood
rosa
leaped
to
her
feet
threw
down
her
sewing
and
went
upstairs
with
her
heart
beating
until
she
came
to
the
attic
door
she
held
her
breath
and
laid
her
ear
against
the
door
she
stayed
like
that
until
amalia
returned
she
went
on
tiptoe
taking
care
to
make
no
noise
but
as
she
was
not
very
and
was
always
in
a
hurry
she
was
always
tripping
upon
the
stairs
and
once
while
she
was
listening
leaning
forward
with
her
cheek
glued
to
the
keyhole
she
lost
her
balance
and
banged
her
forehead
against
the
door
she
was
so
alarmed
that
she
lost
her
breath
the
piano
stopped
dead
she
could
not
escape
she
was
getting
up
when
the
door
opened
christophe
saw
her
glared
at
her
furiously
and
then
without
a
word
brushed
her
aside
walked
angrily
downstairs
and
went
out
he
did
not
return
until
dinner
time
paid
no
heed
to
the
despairing
looks
with
which
she
asked
his
pardon
ignored
her
existence
and
for
several
weeks
he
never
played
at
all
rosa
secretly
shed
many
tears
no
one
noticed
it
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
her
ardently
she
prayed
to
god
for
what
she
did
not
know
she
had
to
confide
her
grief
in
some
one
she
was
sure
that
christophe
detested
her
and
in
spite
of
all
she
hoped
it
was
enough
for
her
if
christophe
seemed
to
show
any
sign
of
interest
in
her
if
he
appeared
to
listen
to
what
she
said
if
he
pressed
her
hand
with
a
little
more
friendliness
than
usual
a
few
imprudent
words
from
her
relations
set
her
imagination
off
upon
a
false
road
the
whole
family
was
filled
with
sympathy
for
christophe
the
big
boy
of
sixteen
serious
and
solitary
who
had
such
lofty
ideas
of
his
duty
inspired
a
sort
of
respect
in
them
all
his
fits
of
his
obstinate
silences
his
gloomy
air
his
brusque
manner
were
not
surprising
in
such
a
house
as
that
frau
vogel
herself
who
regarded
every
artist
as
a
loafer
dared
not
reproach
him
aggressively
as
she
would
have
liked
to
do
with
the
hours
that
he
spent
in
in
the
evening
leaning
motionless
out
of
the
attic
window
overlooking
the
yard
until
night
fell
for
she
knew
that
during
the
rest
of
the
day
he
was
hard
at
work
with
his
lessons
and
she
humored
him
like
the
rest
for
an
ulterior
motive
which
no
one
expressed
though
everybody
knew
it
rosa
had
seen
her
parents
exchanging
looks
and
mysterious
whisperings
when
she
was
talking
to
christophe
at
first
she
took
no
notice
of
it
then
she
was
puzzled
and
roused
by
it
she
longed
to
know
what
they
were
saying
but
dared
not
ask
one
evening
when
she
had
climbed
on
to
a
garden
seat
to
untie
the
hung
between
two
trees
she
leaned
on
christophe
shoulder
to
jump
down
just
at
that
moment
her
eyes
met
her
grandfather
and
her
father
they
were
sitting
smoking
their
pipes
and
leaning
against
the
wall
of
the
house
the
two
men
winked
at
each
other
and
justus
euler
said
to
vogel
they
will
make
a
fine
couple
vogel
nudged
him
seeing
that
the
girl
was
listening
and
he
covered
his
remark
very
cleverly
or
so
he
thought
with
a
loud
hm
hm
that
could
have
been
heard
twenty
yards
away
christophe
whose
back
was
turned
saw
nothing
but
rosa
was
so
bowled
over
by
it
that
she
forgot
that
she
was
jumping
down
and
sprained
her
foot
she
would
have
fallen
had
not
christophe
caught
her
muttering
curses
on
her
clumsiness
she
had
hurt
herself
badly
but
she
did
not
show
it
she
hardly
thought
of
it
she
thought
only
of
what
she
had
just
heard
she
walked
to
her
room
every
step
was
agony
to
her
she
stiffened
herself
against
it
so
as
not
to
let
it
be
seen
a
delicious
vague
uneasiness
surged
through
her
she
fell
into
a
chair
at
the
foot
of
her
bed
and
hid
her
face
in
the
coverlet
her
cheeks
were
burning
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
and
she
laughed
she
was
ashamed
she
wished
to
sink
into
the
depths
of
the
earth
she
could
not
fix
her
ideas
her
blood
beat
in
her
temples
there
were
sharp
pains
in
her
ankle
she
was
in
a
feverish
stupor
vaguely
she
heard
sounds
outside
children
crying
and
playing
in
the
street
and
her
grandfather
words
were
ringing
in
her
ears
she
was
thrilled
she
laughed
softly
she
blushed
with
her
face
buried
in
the
eiderdown
she
prayed
gave
thanks
desired
feared
she
loved
her
mother
called
her
she
tried
to
get
up
at
the
first
step
she
felt
a
pain
so
unbearable
that
she
almost
fainted
her
head
swam
she
thought
she
was
going
to
die
she
wished
to
die
and
at
the
same
time
she
wished
to
live
with
all
the
forces
of
her
being
to
live
for
the
promised
happiness
her
mother
came
at
last
and
the
whole
household
was
soon
excited
she
was
scolded
as
usual
her
ankle
was
dressed
she
was
put
to
bed
and
sank
into
the
sweet
bewilderment
of
her
physical
pain
and
her
inward
joy
the
night
was
sweet
the
smallest
memory
of
that
dear
evening
was
hallowed
for
her
she
did
not
think
of
christophe
she
knew
not
what
she
thought
she
was
happy
the
next
day
christophe
who
thought
himself
in
some
measure
responsible
for
the
accident
came
to
make
inquiries
and
for
the
first
time
he
made
some
show
of
affection
for
her
she
was
filled
with
gratitude
and
blessed
her
sprained
ankle
she
would
gladly
have
suffered
all
her
life
if
all
her
life
she
might
have
such
she
had
to
lie
down
for
several
days
and
never
move
she
spent
them
in
turning
over
and
over
her
words
and
considering
them
had
he
said
they
will
or
they
would
but
it
was
possible
that
he
had
never
said
anything
of
this
kind
yes
he
had
said
it
she
was
certain
of
it
what
did
they
not
see
that
she
was
ugly
and
that
christophe
could
not
bear
her
but
it
was
so
good
to
hope
she
came
to
believe
that
perhaps
she
had
been
wrong
that
she
was
not
as
ugly
as
she
thought
she
would
sit
up
on
her
sofa
to
try
and
see
herself
in
the
mirror
on
the
wall
opposite
above
the
mantelpiece
she
did
not
know
what
to
think
after
all
her
father
and
her
grandfather
were
better
judges
than
herself
people
can
not
tell
about
themselves
oh
heaven
if
it
were
possible
if
it
could
be
if
she
never
dared
think
it
if
if
she
were
pretty
perhaps
also
she
had
exaggerated
antipathy
no
doubt
he
was
indifferent
and
after
the
interest
he
had
shown
in
her
the
day
after
the
accident
did
not
bother
about
her
any
more
he
forgot
to
inquire
but
rosa
made
excuses
for
him
he
was
so
busy
how
should
he
think
of
her
an
artist
can
not
be
judged
like
other
men
and
yet
resigned
though
she
was
she
could
not
help
expecting
with
beating
heart
a
word
of
sympathy
from
him
when
he
came
near
her
a
word
only
a
look
her
imagination
did
the
rest
in
the
beginning
love
needs
so
little
food
it
is
enough
to
see
to
touch
as
you
pass
such
a
power
of
dreams
flows
from
the
soul
in
such
moments
that
almost
of
itself
it
can
create
its
love
a
trifle
can
plunge
it
into
ecstasy
that
later
when
it
is
more
satisfied
and
in
proportion
more
exacting
it
will
hardly
find
again
when
at
last
it
does
possess
the
object
of
its
rosa
lived
absolutely
though
no
one
knew
it
in
a
romance
of
her
own
fashioning
pieced
together
by
herself
christophe
loved
her
secretly
and
was
too
shy
to
confess
his
love
or
there
was
some
stupid
reason
fantastic
or
romantic
delightful
to
the
imagination
of
the
sentimental
little
ninny
she
fashioned
endless
stories
and
all
perfectly
absurd
she
knew
it
herself
but
tried
not
to
know
it
she
lied
to
herself
voluptuously
for
days
and
days
as
she
bent
over
her
sewing
it
made
her
forget
to
talk
her
flood
of
words
was
turned
inward
like
a
river
which
suddenly
disappears
underground
but
then
the
river
took
its
revenge
what
a
debauch
of
speeches
of
unuttered
conversations
which
no
one
heard
but
herself
sometimes
her
lips
would
move
as
they
do
with
people
who
have
to
spell
out
the
syllables
to
themselves
as
they
read
so
as
to
understand
them
when
her
dreams
left
her
she
was
happy
and
sad
she
knew
that
things
were
not
as
she
had
just
told
herself
but
she
was
left
with
a
reflected
happiness
and
had
greater
confidence
for
her
life
she
did
not
despair
of
winning
christophe
she
did
not
admit
it
to
herself
but
she
set
about
doing
it
with
the
sureness
of
instinct
that
great
affection
brings
the
awkward
ignorant
girl
contrived
immediately
to
find
the
road
by
which
she
might
reach
her
beloved
heart
she
did
not
turn
directly
to
him
but
as
soon
as
she
was
better
and
could
once
more
walk
about
the
house
she
approached
louisa
the
smallest
excuse
served
she
found
a
thousand
little
services
to
render
her
when
she
went
out
she
never
failed
to
undertake
various
errands
she
spared
her
going
to
the
market
arguments
with
tradespeople
she
would
fetch
water
for
her
from
the
pump
in
the
yard
she
cleaned
the
windows
and
polished
the
floors
in
spite
of
louisa
protestations
who
was
confused
when
she
did
not
do
her
work
alone
but
she
was
so
weary
that
she
had
not
the
strength
to
oppose
anybody
who
came
to
help
her
christophe
was
out
all
day
louisa
felt
that
she
was
deserted
and
the
companionship
of
the
affectionate
chattering
girl
was
pleasant
to
her
rosa
took
up
her
quarters
in
her
room
she
brought
her
sewing
and
talked
all
the
time
by
clumsy
devices
she
tried
to
bring
conversation
round
to
christophe
just
to
hear
of
him
even
to
hear
his
name
made
her
happy
her
hands
would
tremble
she
would
sit
with
downcast
eyes
louisa
was
delighted
to
talk
of
her
beloved
christophe
and
would
tell
little
tales
of
his
childhood
trivial
and
just
a
little
ridiculous
but
there
was
no
fear
of
rosa
thinking
them
so
she
took
a
great
joy
and
there
was
a
dear
emotion
for
her
in
imagining
christophe
as
a
child
and
doing
all
the
tricks
and
having
all
the
darling
ways
of
children
in
her
the
motherly
tenderness
which
lies
in
the
hearts
of
all
women
was
mingled
deliciously
with
that
other
tenderness
she
would
laugh
heartily
and
tears
would
come
to
her
eyes
louisa
was
touched
by
the
interest
that
rosa
took
in
her
she
guessed
dimly
what
was
in
the
heart
but
she
never
let
it
appear
that
she
did
so
but
she
was
glad
of
it
for
of
all
in
the
house
she
only
knew
the
worth
of
the
girl
heart
sometimes
she
would
stop
talking
to
look
at
her
rosa
surprised
by
her
silence
would
raise
her
eyes
from
her
work
louisa
would
smile
at
her
rosa
would
throw
herself
into
her
arms
suddenly
passionately
and
would
hide
her
face
in
louisa
bosom
then
they
would
go
on
working
and
talking
as
if
nothing
had
happened
in
the
evening
when
christophe
came
home
louisa
grateful
for
attentions
and
in
pursuance
of
the
little
plan
she
had
made
always
praised
the
girl
to
the
skies
christophe
was
touched
by
rosa
kindness
he
saw
how
much
good
she
was
doing
his
mother
in
whose
face
there
was
more
serenity
and
he
would
thank
her
effusively
rosa
would
murmur
and
escape
to
conceal
her
embarrassment
so
she
appeared
a
thousand
times
more
intelligent
and
sympathetic
to
christophe
than
if
she
had
spoken
he
looked
at
her
less
with
a
prejudiced
eye
and
did
not
conceal
his
surprise
at
finding
unsuspected
qualities
in
her
rosa
saw
that
she
marked
the
progress
that
she
made
in
his
sympathy
and
thought
that
his
sympathy
would
lead
to
love
she
gave
herself
up
more
than
ever
to
her
dreams
she
came
near
to
believing
with
the
beautiful
presumption
of
youth
that
what
you
desire
with
all
your
being
is
always
accomplished
in
the
end
besides
how
was
her
desire
unreasonable
should
not
christophe
have
been
more
sensible
than
any
other
of
her
goodness
and
her
affectionate
need
of
but
christophe
gave
no
thought
to
her
he
esteemed
her
but
she
filled
no
room
in
his
thoughts
he
was
busied
with
far
other
things
at
the
moment
christophe
was
no
longer
christophe
he
did
not
know
himself
he
was
in
a
mighty
travail
that
was
like
to
sweep
everything
away
a
complete
upheaval
christophe
was
conscious
of
extreme
weariness
and
great
uneasiness
he
was
for
no
reason
worn
out
his
head
was
heavy
his
eyes
his
ears
all
his
senses
were
dumb
and
throbbing
he
could
not
give
his
attention
to
anything
his
mind
leaped
from
one
subject
to
another
and
was
in
a
fever
that
sucked
him
dry
the
perpetual
fluttering
of
images
in
his
mind
made
him
giddy
at
first
he
attributed
it
to
fatigue
and
the
enervation
of
the
first
days
of
spring
but
spring
passed
and
his
sickness
only
grew
worse
it
was
what
the
poets
who
only
touch
lightly
on
things
call
the
unease
of
adolescence
the
trouble
of
the
cherubim
the
waking
of
the
desire
of
love
in
the
young
body
and
soul
as
if
the
fearful
crisis
of
all
a
man
being
breaking
up
dying
and
coming
to
full
rebirth
as
if
the
cataclysm
in
which
everything
faith
thought
action
all
life
seems
like
to
be
blotted
out
and
then
to
be
in
the
convulsions
of
sorrow
and
joy
can
be
reduced
to
terms
of
a
child
folly
all
his
body
and
soul
were
in
a
ferment
he
watched
them
having
no
strength
to
struggle
with
a
mixture
of
curiosity
and
disgust
he
did
not
understand
what
was
happening
in
himself
his
whole
being
was
disintegrated
he
spent
days
together
in
absolute
torpor
work
was
torture
to
him
at
night
he
slept
heavily
and
in
snatches
dreaming
monstrously
with
gusts
of
desire
the
soul
of
a
beast
was
racing
madly
in
him
burning
bathed
in
sweat
he
watched
himself
in
horror
he
tried
to
break
free
of
the
crazy
and
unclean
thoughts
that
possessed
him
and
he
wondered
if
he
were
going
mad
the
day
gave
him
no
shelter
from
his
brutish
thoughts
in
the
depths
of
his
soul
he
felt
that
he
was
slipping
down
and
down
there
was
no
stay
to
clutch
at
no
barrier
to
keep
back
chaos
all
his
defenses
all
his
citadels
with
the
quadruple
rampart
that
hemmed
him
in
so
proudly
his
god
his
art
his
pride
his
moral
faith
all
was
crumbling
away
falling
piece
by
piece
from
him
he
saw
himself
naked
bound
lying
unable
to
move
like
a
corpse
on
which
vermin
swarm
he
had
spasms
of
revolt
where
was
his
will
of
which
he
was
so
proud
he
called
to
it
in
vain
it
was
like
the
efforts
that
one
makes
in
sleep
knowing
that
one
is
dreaming
and
trying
to
awake
then
one
succeeds
only
in
falling
from
one
dream
to
another
like
a
lump
of
lead
and
in
being
more
and
more
choked
by
the
suffocation
of
the
soul
in
bondage
at
last
he
found
that
it
was
less
painful
not
to
struggle
he
decided
not
to
do
so
with
fatalistic
apathy
and
despair
the
even
tenor
of
his
life
seemed
to
be
broken
up
now
he
slipped
down
a
subterranean
crevasse
and
was
like
to
disappear
now
he
bounded
up
again
with
a
violent
jerk
the
chain
of
his
days
was
snapped
in
the
midst
of
the
even
plain
of
the
hours
great
gaping
holes
would
open
to
engulf
his
soul
christophe
looked
on
at
the
spectacle
as
though
it
did
not
concern
him
everything
everybody
and
himself
were
strange
to
him
he
went
about
his
business
did
his
work
automatically
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
machinery
of
his
life
might
stop
at
any
moment
the
wheels
were
out
of
gear
at
dinner
with
his
mother
and
the
others
in
the
orchestra
with
the
musicians
and
the
audience
suddenly
there
would
be
a
void
and
emptiness
in
his
brain
he
would
look
stupidly
at
the
grinning
faces
about
him
and
he
could
not
understand
he
would
ask
himself
what
is
there
between
these
creatures
and
he
dared
not
even
say
and
me
for
he
knew
not
whether
he
existed
he
would
speak
and
his
voice
would
seem
to
issue
from
another
body
he
would
move
and
he
saw
his
movements
from
afar
from
above
from
the
top
of
a
tower
he
would
pass
his
hand
over
his
face
and
his
eyes
would
wander
he
was
often
near
doing
crazy
things
it
was
especially
when
he
was
most
in
public
that
he
had
to
keep
guard
on
himself
for
example
on
the
evenings
when
he
went
to
the
palace
or
was
playing
in
public
then
he
would
suddenly
be
seized
by
a
terrific
desire
to
make
a
face
or
say
something
outrageous
to
pull
the
grand
duke
nose
or
to
take
a
running
kick
at
one
of
the
ladies
one
whole
evening
while
he
was
conducting
the
orchestra
he
struggled
against
an
insensate
desire
to
undress
himself
in
public
and
he
was
haunted
by
the
idea
from
the
moment
when
he
tried
to
check
it
he
had
to
exert
all
his
strength
not
to
give
way
to
it
when
he
issued
from
the
brute
struggle
he
was
dripping
with
sweat
and
his
mind
was
blank
he
was
really
mad
it
was
enough
for
him
to
think
that
he
must
not
do
a
thing
for
it
to
fasten
on
him
with
the
maddening
tenacity
of
a
fixed
idea
so
his
life
was
spent
in
a
series
of
unbridled
outbreaks
and
of
endless
falls
into
emptiness
a
furious
wind
in
the
desert
whence
came
this
wind
from
what
abyss
came
these
desires
that
wrenched
his
body
and
mind
he
was
like
a
bow
stretched
to
breaking
point
by
a
strong
hand
to
what
end
unknown
which
then
springs
back
like
a
piece
of
dead
wood
of
what
force
was
he
the
prey
he
dared
not
probe
for
it
he
felt
that
he
was
beaten
humiliated
and
he
would
not
face
his
defeat
he
was
weary
and
broken
in
spirit
he
understood
now
the
people
whom
formerly
he
had
despised
those
who
will
not
seek
awkward
truth
in
the
empty
hours
when
he
remembered
that
time
was
passing
his
work
neglected
the
future
lost
he
was
frozen
with
terror
but
there
was
no
reaction
and
his
cowardice
found
excuses
in
desperate
affirmation
of
the
void
in
which
he
lived
he
took
a
bitter
delight
in
abandoning
himself
to
it
like
a
wreck
on
the
waters
what
was
the
good
of
fighting
there
was
nothing
beautiful
nor
good
neither
god
nor
life
nor
being
of
any
sort
in
the
street
as
he
walked
suddenly
the
earth
would
sink
away
from
him
there
was
neither
ground
nor
air
nor
light
nor
himself
there
was
nothing
he
would
fall
his
head
would
drag
him
down
face
forwards
he
could
hardly
hold
himself
up
he
was
on
the
point
of
collapse
he
thought
he
was
going
to
die
suddenly
struck
down
he
thought
he
was
dead
christophe
was
growing
a
new
skin
christophe
was
growing
a
new
soul
and
seeing
the
worn
out
and
rotten
soul
of
his
childhood
falling
away
he
never
dreamed
that
he
was
taking
on
a
new
one
young
and
stronger
as
through
life
we
change
our
bodies
so
also
do
we
change
our
souls
and
the
metamorphosis
does
not
always
take
place
slowly
over
many
days
there
are
times
of
crisis
when
the
whole
is
suddenly
renewed
the
adult
changes
his
soul
the
old
soul
that
is
cast
off
dies
in
those
hours
of
anguish
we
think
that
all
is
at
an
end
and
the
whole
thing
begins
again
a
life
dies
another
life
has
already
come
into
being
one
night
he
was
alone
in
his
room
with
his
elbow
on
his
desk
under
the
light
of
a
candle
his
back
was
turned
to
the
window
he
was
not
working
he
had
not
been
able
to
work
for
weeks
everything
was
twisting
and
turning
in
his
head
he
had
brought
everything
under
scrutiny
at
once
religion
morals
art
the
whole
of
life
and
in
the
general
dissolution
of
his
thoughts
was
no
method
no
order
he
had
plunged
into
the
reading
of
books
taken
haphazard
from
his
grandfather
heterogeneous
library
or
from
vogel
collection
of
books
books
of
theology
science
philosophy
an
odd
lot
of
which
he
understood
nothing
having
everything
to
learn
he
could
not
finish
any
of
them
and
in
the
middle
of
them
went
off
on
divagations
endless
whimsies
which
left
him
weary
empty
and
in
mortal
sorrow
so
that
evening
he
was
sunk
in
an
exhausted
torpor
the
whole
house
was
asleep
his
window
was
open
not
a
breath
came
up
from
the
yard
thick
clouds
filled
the
sky
christophe
mechanically
watched
the
candle
burn
away
at
the
bottom
of
the
candlestick
he
could
not
go
to
bed
he
had
no
thought
of
anything
he
felt
the
void
growing
growing
from
moment
to
moment
he
tried
not
to
see
the
abyss
that
drew
him
to
its
brink
and
in
spite
of
himself
he
leaned
over
and
his
eyes
gazed
into
the
depths
of
the
night
in
the
void
chaos
was
stirring
and
faint
sounds
came
from
the
darkness
agony
filled
him
a
shiver
ran
down
his
spine
his
skin
tingled
he
clutched
the
table
so
as
not
to
fall
convulsively
he
awaited
nameless
things
a
miracle
a
god
suddenly
like
an
opened
sluice
in
the
yard
behind
him
a
deluge
of
water
a
heavy
rain
large
drops
down
pouring
fell
the
still
air
quivered
the
dry
hard
soil
rang
out
like
a
bell
and
the
vast
scent
of
the
earth
burning
warm
as
that
of
an
animal
the
smell
of
the
flowers
fruit
and
amorous
flesh
rose
in
a
spasm
of
fury
and
pleasure
christophe
under
illusion
at
fullest
stretch
shook
he
trembled
the
veil
was
rent
he
was
blinded
by
a
flash
of
lightning
he
saw
in
the
depths
of
the
night
he
saw
he
was
god
god
was
in
himself
he
burst
the
ceiling
of
the
room
the
walls
of
the
house
he
cracked
the
very
bounds
of
existence
he
filled
the
sky
the
universe
space
the
world
coursed
through
him
like
a
cataract
in
the
horror
and
ecstasy
of
that
cataclysm
christophe
fell
too
swept
along
by
the
whirlwind
which
brushed
away
and
crushed
like
straws
the
laws
of
nature
he
was
breathless
he
was
drunk
with
the
swift
hurtling
down
into
god
fire
of
being
hurricane
of
life
madness
of
living
aimless
uncontrolled
beyond
reason
for
the
fury
of
living
when
the
crisis
was
over
he
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
and
slept
as
he
had
not
done
for
long
enough
next
day
when
he
awoke
his
head
swam
he
was
as
broken
as
though
he
had
been
drunk
but
in
his
inmost
heart
he
had
still
a
beam
of
that
somber
and
great
light
that
had
struck
him
down
the
night
before
he
tried
to
relight
it
in
vain
the
more
he
pursued
it
the
more
it
eluded
him
from
that
time
on
all
his
energy
was
directed
towards
recalling
the
vision
of
a
moment
the
endeavor
was
futile
ecstasy
does
not
answer
the
bidding
of
the
will
but
that
mystic
exaltation
was
not
the
only
experience
that
he
had
of
it
it
recurred
several
times
but
never
with
the
intensity
of
the
first
it
came
always
at
moments
when
christophe
was
least
expecting
it
for
a
second
only
a
time
so
short
so
sudden
no
longer
than
a
wink
of
an
eye
or
a
raising
of
a
hand
that
the
vision
was
gone
before
he
could
discover
that
it
was
and
then
he
would
wonder
whether
he
had
not
dreamed
it
after
that
fiery
bolt
that
had
set
the
night
aflame
it
was
a
gleaming
dust
shedding
fleeting
sparks
which
the
eye
could
hardly
see
as
they
sped
by
but
they
reappeared
more
and
more
often
and
in
the
end
they
surrounded
christophe
with
a
halo
of
perpetual
misty
dreams
in
which
his
spirit
melted
everything
that
distracted
him
in
his
state
of
was
an
irritation
to
him
it
was
impossible
to
work
he
gave
up
thinking
about
it
society
was
odious
to
him
and
more
than
any
that
of
his
intimates
even
that
of
his
mother
because
they
arrogated
to
themselves
more
rights
over
his
soul
he
left
the
house
he
took
to
spending
his
days
abroad
and
never
returned
until
nightfall
he
sought
the
solitude
of
the
fields
and
delivered
himself
up
to
it
drank
his
fill
of
it
like
a
maniac
who
wishes
not
to
be
disturbed
by
anything
in
the
obsession
of
his
fixed
but
in
the
great
sweet
air
in
contact
with
the
earth
his
obsession
relaxed
his
ideas
ceased
to
appear
like
specters
his
exaltation
was
no
less
rather
it
was
heightened
but
it
was
no
longer
a
dangerous
delirium
of
the
mind
but
a
healthy
intoxication
of
his
whole
being
body
and
soul
crazy
in
their
strength
he
rediscovered
the
world
as
though
he
had
never
seen
it
it
was
a
new
childhood
it
was
as
though
a
magic
word
had
been
uttered
an
open
sesame
nature
flamed
with
gladness
the
sun
boiled
the
liquid
sky
ran
like
a
clear
river
the
earth
steamed
and
cried
aloud
in
delight
the
plants
the
trees
the
insects
all
the
innumerable
creatures
were
like
dazzling
tongues
of
flame
in
the
fire
of
life
writhing
upwards
everything
sang
aloud
in
joy
and
that
joy
was
his
own
that
strength
was
his
own
he
was
no
longer
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
world
till
then
even
in
the
happy
days
of
childhood
when
he
saw
nature
with
ardent
and
delightful
curiosity
all
creatures
had
seemed
to
him
to
be
little
worlds
shut
up
terrifying
and
grotesque
unrelated
to
himself
and
incomprehensible
he
was
not
even
sure
that
they
had
feeling
and
life
they
were
strange
machines
and
sometimes
christophe
had
even
with
the
unconscious
cruelty
of
a
child
dismembered
wretched
insects
without
dreaming
that
they
might
suffer
for
the
pleasure
of
watching
their
queer
contortions
his
uncle
gottfried
usually
so
calm
had
one
day
indignantly
to
snatch
from
his
hands
an
unhappy
fly
that
he
was
torturing
the
boy
had
tried
to
laugh
at
first
then
he
had
burst
into
tears
moved
by
his
uncle
emotion
he
began
to
understand
that
his
victim
did
really
exist
as
well
as
himself
and
that
he
had
committed
a
crime
but
if
thereafter
nothing
would
have
induced
him
to
do
harm
to
the
beasts
he
never
felt
any
sympathy
for
them
he
used
to
pass
them
by
without
ever
trying
to
feel
what
it
was
that
worked
their
machinery
rather
he
was
afraid
to
think
of
it
it
was
something
like
a
bad
and
now
everything
was
made
plaint
these
humble
obscure
creatures
became
in
their
turn
centers
of
light
lying
on
his
belly
in
the
grass
where
creatures
swarmed
in
the
shade
of
the
trees
that
buzzed
with
insects
christophe
would
watch
the
fevered
movements
of
the
ants
the
spiders
that
seemed
to
dance
as
they
walked
the
bounding
grasshoppers
that
leap
aside
the
heavy
bustling
beetles
and
the
naked
worms
pink
and
glabrous
mottled
with
white
or
with
his
hands
under
his
head
and
his
eyes
dosed
he
would
listen
to
the
invisible
orchestra
the
roundelay
of
the
frenzied
insects
circling
in
a
sunbeam
about
the
scented
pines
the
trumpeting
of
the
mosquitoes
the
organ
notes
of
the
wasps
the
brass
of
the
wild
bees
humming
like
bells
in
the
tops
of
the
trees
and
the
godlike
whispering
of
the
swaying
trees
the
sweet
moaning
of
the
wind
in
the
branches
the
soft
whispering
of
the
waving
grass
like
a
breath
of
wind
rippling
the
limpid
surface
of
a
lake
like
the
rustling
of
a
light
dress
and
lovers
footsteps
coming
near
and
passing
then
lost
upon
the
air
he
heard
all
these
sounds
and
cries
within
himself
through
all
these
creatures
from
the
smallest
to
the
greatest
flowed
the
same
river
of
life
and
in
it
he
too
swam
so
he
was
one
of
them
he
was
of
their
blood
and
brotherly
he
heard
the
echo
of
their
sorrows
and
their
joys
their
strength
was
merged
is
his
like
a
river
fed
with
thousands
of
streams
he
sank
into
them
his
lungs
were
like
to
burst
with
the
wind
too
freely
blowing
too
strong
that
burst
the
windows
and
forced
its
way
into
the
closed
house
of
his
suffocating
heart
the
change
was
too
abrupt
after
finding
everywhere
a
void
when
he
had
been
buried
only
in
his
own
existence
and
had
felt
it
slipping
from
him
and
dissolving
like
rain
now
everywhere
he
found
infinite
and
unmeasured
being
now
that
he
longed
to
forget
himself
to
find
rebirth
in
the
universe
he
seemed
to
have
issued
from
the
grave
he
swam
voluptuously
in
life
flowing
free
and
full
and
borne
on
by
its
current
he
thought
that
he
was
free
he
did
not
know
that
he
was
less
free
than
ever
that
no
creature
is
ever
free
that
even
the
law
that
governs
the
universe
is
not
free
that
only
death
perhaps
can
bring
deliverance
but
the
chrysalis
issuing
from
its
stifling
sheath
joyously
stretched
its
limbs
in
its
new
shape
and
had
no
time
as
yet
to
mark
the
bounds
of
its
new
prison
there
began
a
new
cycle
of
days
days
of
gold
and
fever
mysterious
enchanted
like
those
of
his
childhood
when
by
one
he
discovered
things
for
the
first
time
from
dawn
to
set
of
sun
he
lived
in
one
long
mirage
he
deserted
all
his
business
the
conscientious
boy
who
for
years
had
never
missed
a
lesson
or
an
orchestra
rehearsal
even
when
he
was
ill
was
forever
finding
paltry
excuses
for
neglecting
his
work
he
was
not
afraid
to
lie
he
had
no
remorse
about
it
the
stoic
principles
of
life
to
which
he
had
hitherto
delighted
to
bend
his
will
morality
duty
now
seemed
to
him
to
have
no
truth
nor
reason
their
jealous
despotism
was
smashed
against
nature
human
nature
healthy
strong
free
that
alone
was
virtue
to
hell
with
all
the
rest
it
provoked
pitying
laughter
to
see
the
little
peddling
rules
of
prudence
and
policy
which
the
world
adorns
with
the
name
of
morality
while
it
pretends
to
inclose
all
life
within
them
a
preposterous
an
people
life
sees
to
it
that
they
are
brought
to
reason
life
does
but
pass
and
all
is
swept
away
bursting
with
energy
christophe
had
moments
when
he
was
consumed
with
a
desire
to
destroy
to
burn
to
smash
to
glut
with
actions
blind
and
uncontrolled
the
force
which
choked
him
these
outbursts
usually
ended
in
a
sharp
reaction
he
would
weep
and
fling
himself
down
on
the
ground
and
kiss
the
earth
and
try
to
dig
into
it
with
his
teeth
and
hands
to
feed
himself
with
it
to
merge
into
it
he
trembled
then
with
fever
and
desire
one
evening
he
was
walking
in
the
outskirts
of
a
wood
his
eyes
were
swimming
with
the
light
his
head
was
whirling
he
was
in
that
state
of
exaltation
when
all
creatures
and
things
were
transfigured
to
that
was
added
the
magic
of
the
soft
warm
light
of
evening
bays
of
purple
and
gold
hovered
in
the
trees
from
the
meadows
seemed
to
come
a
phosphorescent
glimmer
in
a
field
near
by
a
girl
was
making
hay
in
her
blouse
and
short
skirt
with
her
arms
and
neck
bare
she
was
raking
the
hay
and
heaping
it
up
she
had
a
short
nose
wide
cheeks
a
round
face
a
handkerchief
thrown
over
her
hair
the
setting
sun
touched
with
red
her
sunburned
skin
which
like
a
piece
of
pottery
seemed
to
absorb
the
last
beams
of
the
day
she
fascinated
christophe
leaning
against
a
he
watched
her
come
towards
the
verge
of
the
woods
eagerly
passionately
everything
else
had
disappeared
she
took
no
notice
of
him
for
a
moment
she
looked
at
him
cautiously
he
saw
her
eyes
blue
and
hard
in
her
brown
face
she
passed
so
near
to
him
that
when
she
leaned
down
to
gather
up
the
hay
through
her
open
blouse
he
saw
a
soft
down
on
her
shoulders
and
back
suddenly
the
vague
desire
which
was
in
him
leaped
forth
he
hurled
himself
at
her
from
behind
seized
her
neck
and
waist
threw
back
her
head
and
fastened
his
lips
upon
hers
he
kissed
her
dry
cracked
lips
until
he
came
against
her
teeth
that
bit
him
angrily
his
hands
ran
over
her
rough
arms
over
her
blouse
wet
with
her
sweat
she
struggled
he
held
her
tighter
he
wished
to
strangle
her
she
broke
loose
cried
out
spat
wiped
her
lips
with
her
hand
and
hurled
insults
at
him
he
let
her
go
and
fled
across
the
fields
she
threw
stones
at
him
and
went
on
discharging
after
him
a
litany
of
filthy
epithets
he
blushed
less
for
anything
that
she
might
say
or
think
but
for
what
he
was
thinking
himself
the
sudden
unconscious
act
filled
him
with
terror
what
had
he
done
what
should
he
do
what
he
was
able
to
understand
of
it
all
only
filled
him
with
disgust
and
he
was
tempted
by
his
disgust
he
fought
against
himself
and
knew
not
on
which
side
was
the
real
christophe
a
blind
force
beset
him
in
vain
did
he
fly
from
it
it
was
only
to
fly
from
himself
what
would
she
do
about
him
what
should
he
do
in
an
hour
the
time
it
took
to
cross
the
plowed
field
to
reach
the
road
would
he
ever
reach
it
should
he
not
stop
and
go
back
and
run
back
to
the
girl
and
then
he
remembered
that
delirious
moment
when
he
had
held
her
by
the
throat
everything
was
possible
all
things
were
worth
while
a
crime
even
yes
even
a
crime
the
turmoil
in
his
heart
made
him
breathless
when
he
reached
the
road
he
stopped
to
breathe
over
there
the
girl
was
talking
to
another
girl
who
had
been
attracted
by
her
cries
and
with
arms
akimbo
they
were
looking
at
each
other
and
shouting
with
laughter
ii
sabine
he
went
home
he
shut
himself
up
in
his
room
and
never
stirred
for
several
days
he
only
went
out
even
into
the
town
when
he
was
compelled
he
was
fearful
of
ever
going
out
beyond
the
gates
and
venturing
forth
into
the
fields
he
was
afraid
of
once
more
falling
in
with
the
soft
maddening
breath
that
had
blown
upon
him
like
a
rushing
wind
during
a
calm
in
a
storm
he
thought
that
the
walls
of
the
town
might
preserve
him
from
it
he
never
dreamed
that
for
the
enemy
to
slip
within
there
needed
be
only
the
smallest
crack
in
the
closed
shutters
no
more
than
is
needed
for
a
peep
out
in
a
wing
of
the
house
on
the
other
side
of
the
yard
there
lodged
on
the
ground
floor
a
young
woman
of
twenty
some
months
a
widow
with
a
little
girl
frau
sabine
froehlich
was
also
a
tenant
of
old
euler
she
occupied
the
shop
which
opened
on
to
the
street
and
she
had
as
well
two
rooms
looking
on
to
the
yard
together
with
a
little
patch
of
garden
marked
off
from
the
eulers
by
a
wire
fence
up
which
ivy
climbed
they
did
not
often
see
her
the
child
used
to
play
down
in
the
garden
from
morning
to
night
making
mud
pies
and
the
garden
was
left
to
itself
to
the
great
distress
of
old
justus
who
loved
tidy
paths
and
neatness
in
the
beds
he
had
tried
to
bring
the
matter
to
the
attention
of
his
tenant
but
that
was
probably
why
she
did
not
appear
and
the
garden
was
not
improved
by
it
frau
froehlich
kept
a
little
draper
shop
which
might
have
had
customers
enough
thanks
to
its
position
in
a
street
of
shops
in
the
center
of
the
town
but
she
did
not
bother
about
it
any
more
than
about
her
garden
instead
of
doing
her
housework
herself
as
according
to
frau
vogel
every
woman
ought
to
do
especially
when
she
is
in
circumstances
which
do
not
permit
much
less
excuse
idleness
she
had
hired
a
little
servant
a
girl
of
fifteen
who
came
in
for
a
few
hours
in
the
morning
to
clean
the
rooms
and
look
after
the
shop
while
the
young
woman
lay
in
bed
or
dawdled
over
her
toilet
christophe
used
to
see
her
sometimes
through
his
windows
walking
about
her
room
with
bare
feet
in
her
long
nightgown
or
sitting
for
hours
together
before
her
mirror
for
she
was
so
careless
that
she
used
to
forget
to
draw
her
curtains
and
when
she
saw
him
she
was
so
lazy
that
she
could
not
take
the
trouble
to
go
and
lower
them
christophe
more
modest
than
she
would
leave
the
window
so
as
not
to
incommode
her
but
the
temptation
was
great
he
would
blush
a
little
and
steal
a
glance
at
her
bare
arms
which
were
rather
thin
as
she
drew
them
languidly
around
her
flowing
hair
and
with
her
hands
clasped
behind
her
head
lost
herself
in
a
dream
until
they
were
numbed
and
then
she
would
let
them
fall
christophe
would
pretend
that
he
only
saw
these
pleasant
sights
inadvertently
as
he
happened
to
pass
the
window
and
that
they
did
not
disturb
him
in
his
musical
thoughts
but
he
liked
it
and
in
the
end
he
wasted
as
much
time
in
watching
frau
sabine
as
she
did
over
her
toilet
not
that
she
was
a
coquette
she
was
rather
careless
generally
and
did
not
take
anything
like
the
meticulous
care
with
her
appearance
that
amalia
or
rosa
did
if
she
dawdled
in
front
of
her
dressing
table
it
was
from
pure
laziness
every
time
she
put
in
a
pin
she
had
to
rest
from
the
effort
of
it
while
she
made
little
piteous
faces
at
herself
in
the
mirrors
she
was
never
quite
properly
dressed
at
the
end
of
the
day
often
her
servant
used
to
go
before
sabine
was
ready
and
a
customer
would
ring
the
she
would
let
him
ring
and
call
once
or
twice
before
she
could
make
up
her
mind
to
get
up
from
her
chair
she
would
go
down
smiling
and
never
hurrying
never
hurrying
would
look
for
the
article
required
and
if
she
could
not
find
it
after
looking
for
some
time
or
even
as
happened
sometimes
if
she
had
to
take
too
much
trouble
to
reach
it
as
for
instance
taking
the
ladder
from
one
end
of
the
shop
to
the
other
she
would
say
calmly
that
she
did
not
have
it
in
stock
and
as
she
never
bothered
to
put
her
stock
in
order
or
to
order
more
of
the
articles
of
which
she
had
run
out
her
customers
used
to
lose
patience
and
go
elsewhere
but
she
never
minded
how
could
you
be
angry
with
such
a
pleasant
creature
who
spoke
so
sweetly
and
was
never
excited
about
anything
she
did
not
mind
what
anybody
said
to
her
and
she
made
this
so
plain
that
those
who
began
to
complain
never
had
the
courage
to
go
on
they
used
to
go
answering
her
charming
smile
with
a
smile
but
they
never
came
back
she
never
bothered
about
it
she
went
on
smiling
she
was
like
a
little
florentine
figure
her
well
marked
eyebrows
were
arched
her
gray
eyes
were
half
open
behind
the
curtain
of
her
lashes
the
lower
eyelid
was
a
little
swollen
with
a
little
crease
below
it
her
little
finely
drawn
nose
turned
up
slightly
at
the
end
another
little
curve
lay
between
it
and
her
upper
lip
which
curled
up
above
her
mouth
pouting
in
a
weary
smile
her
lower
lip
was
a
little
thick
the
lower
part
of
her
face
was
rounded
and
had
the
serious
expression
of
the
little
virgins
of
filippo
lippi
her
complexion
was
a
little
muddy
her
hair
was
light
brown
always
untidy
and
done
up
in
a
slovenly
chignon
she
was
slight
of
figure
and
her
movements
were
lazy
dressed
carelessly
a
gaping
bodice
buttons
missing
ugly
worn
shoes
always
looking
a
little
slovenly
she
charmed
by
her
grace
and
youth
her
gentleness
her
instinctively
coaxing
ways
when
she
appeared
to
take
the
air
at
the
door
of
her
shop
the
young
men
who
passed
used
to
look
at
her
with
pleasure
and
although
she
did
not
bother
about
them
she
noticed
it
none
the
less
always
then
she
wore
that
grateful
and
glad
expression
which
is
in
the
eyes
of
all
women
when
they
know
that
they
have
been
seen
with
sympathetic
eyes
it
seemed
to
say
thank
you
again
look
at
me
again
but
though
it
gave
her
pleasure
to
please
her
indifference
would
never
let
her
make
the
smallest
effort
to
please
she
was
an
object
of
scandal
to
the
everything
about
her
offended
them
her
indolence
the
untidiness
of
her
house
the
carelessness
of
her
dress
her
polite
indifference
to
their
remarks
her
perpetual
smile
the
impertinent
serenity
with
which
she
had
accepted
her
death
her
child
illnesses
her
straitened
circumstances
the
great
and
annoyances
of
her
daily
life
while
nothing
could
change
one
jot
of
her
favorite
habits
or
her
eternal
longing
everything
about
her
offended
them
and
the
worst
of
all
was
that
as
she
was
she
did
give
pleasure
frau
vogel
could
not
forgive
her
that
it
was
almost
as
though
sabine
did
it
on
purpose
on
purpose
ironically
to
set
at
naught
by
her
conduct
the
great
traditions
the
true
principles
the
savorless
duty
the
pleasureless
labor
the
restlessness
the
noise
the
quarrels
the
mooning
ways
the
healthy
pessimism
which
was
the
motive
power
of
the
euler
family
as
it
is
that
of
all
respectable
persons
and
made
their
life
a
foretaste
of
purgatory
that
a
woman
who
did
nothing
but
dawdle
about
all
the
blessed
day
should
take
upon
herself
to
defy
them
with
her
calm
insolence
while
they
bore
their
suffering
in
silence
like
and
that
people
should
approve
of
her
into
the
bargain
that
was
beyond
the
limit
that
was
enough
to
turn
you
against
respectability
fortunately
thank
god
there
were
still
a
few
sensible
people
left
in
the
world
frau
vogel
consoled
herself
with
them
they
exchanged
remarks
about
the
little
widow
and
spied
on
her
through
her
shutters
such
gossip
was
the
joy
of
the
family
when
they
met
at
supper
christophe
would
listen
absently
he
was
so
used
to
hearing
the
vogels
set
themselves
up
as
censors
of
their
neighbors
that
he
never
took
any
notice
of
it
besides
he
knew
nothing
of
frau
sabine
except
her
bare
neck
and
arms
and
though
they
were
pleasing
enough
they
did
not
justify
his
coming
to
a
definite
opinion
about
her
however
he
was
conscious
of
a
kindly
feeling
towards
her
and
in
a
contradictory
spirit
he
was
especially
grateful
to
her
for
displeasing
frau
vogel
after
dinner
in
the
evening
when
it
was
very
hot
it
was
impossible
to
stay
in
the
stifling
yard
where
the
sun
shone
the
whole
afternoon
the
only
place
in
the
house
where
it
was
possible
to
breathe
was
the
rooms
looking
into
the
street
euler
and
his
used
sometimes
to
go
and
sit
on
the
doorstep
with
louisa
frau
vogel
and
rosa
would
only
appear
for
a
moment
they
were
kept
by
their
housework
frau
vogel
took
a
pride
in
showing
that
she
had
no
time
for
dawdling
and
she
used
to
say
loudly
enough
to
be
overheard
that
all
the
people
sitting
there
and
yawning
on
their
doorsteps
without
doing
a
stitch
of
work
got
on
her
nerves
as
she
could
not
to
her
sorrow
compel
them
to
work
she
would
pretend
not
to
see
them
and
would
go
in
and
work
furiously
rosa
thought
she
must
do
likewise
euler
and
vogel
would
discover
draughts
everywhere
and
fearful
of
catching
cold
would
go
up
to
their
rooms
they
used
to
go
to
bed
early
and
would
have
thought
themselves
ruined
had
they
changed
the
least
of
their
habits
after
nine
only
louisa
and
christophe
would
be
left
louisa
spent
the
day
in
her
room
and
in
the
evening
christophe
used
to
take
pains
to
be
with
her
whenever
he
could
to
make
her
take
the
air
if
she
were
left
alone
she
would
never
go
out
the
noise
of
the
street
frightened
her
children
were
always
chasing
each
other
with
shrill
cries
all
the
dogs
of
the
neighborhood
took
it
up
and
barked
the
sound
of
a
piano
came
up
a
little
farther
off
a
clarinet
and
in
the
next
street
a
cornet
à
piston
voices
chattered
people
came
and
went
and
stood
in
groups
in
front
of
their
houses
louisa
would
have
lost
her
head
if
she
had
been
left
alone
in
all
the
uproar
but
when
her
son
was
with
her
it
gave
her
pleasure
the
noise
would
gradually
die
down
the
children
and
the
dogs
would
go
to
bed
first
the
groups
of
people
would
break
up
the
air
would
become
more
pure
silence
would
descend
upon
the
street
louisa
would
tell
in
her
thin
voice
the
little
scraps
of
news
that
she
had
heard
from
amalia
or
rosa
she
was
not
greatly
interested
in
them
but
she
never
knew
what
to
talk
about
to
her
son
and
she
felt
the
need
of
keeping
in
touch
with
him
of
saying
something
to
him
and
christophe
who
felt
her
need
would
pretend
to
be
interested
in
everything
she
said
but
he
did
not
listen
he
was
off
in
vague
dreams
turning
over
in
his
mind
the
doings
of
the
day
one
evening
when
they
were
sitting
there
while
his
mother
was
talking
he
saw
the
door
of
the
draper
shop
open
a
woman
came
out
silently
and
sat
in
the
street
her
chair
was
only
a
few
yards
from
louisa
she
was
sitting
in
the
darkest
shadow
christophe
could
not
see
her
face
but
he
recognized
her
his
dreams
vanished
the
air
seemed
sweeter
to
him
louisa
had
not
noticed
sabine
presence
and
went
on
with
her
chatter
in
a
low
voice
christophe
paid
more
attention
to
her
and
he
felt
impelled
to
throw
out
a
remark
here
and
there
to
talk
perhaps
to
be
heard
the
slight
figure
sat
there
without
stirring
a
little
limp
with
her
legs
lightly
crossed
and
her
hands
lying
crossed
in
her
lap
she
was
looking
straight
in
front
of
her
and
seemed
to
hear
nothing
louisa
was
overcome
with
drowsiness
she
went
in
christophe
said
he
would
stay
a
little
longer
it
was
nearly
ten
the
street
was
empty
the
people
were
going
indoors
the
sound
of
the
shops
being
shut
was
heard
the
lighted
windows
winked
and
then
were
dark
again
one
or
two
were
still
lit
then
they
were
blotted
out
silence
they
were
alone
they
did
not
look
at
each
other
they
held
their
breath
they
seemed
not
to
be
aware
of
each
other
from
the
distant
fields
came
the
smell
of
the
hay
and
from
a
balcony
in
a
house
near
by
the
scent
of
a
pot
of
cloves
no
wind
stirred
above
their
heads
was
the
milky
way
to
their
right
red
jupiter
above
a
chimney
charles
wain
bent
its
axles
in
the
pale
green
sky
its
stars
flowered
like
daisies
from
the
bells
of
the
parish
church
eleven
rang
out
and
was
caught
up
by
all
the
other
churches
with
their
voices
clear
or
muffled
and
from
the
houses
by
the
dim
chiming
of
the
clock
or
husky
cuckoos
they
awoke
suddenly
from
their
dreams
and
got
up
at
the
same
moment
and
just
as
they
were
going
indoors
they
both
bowed
without
speaking
christophe
went
up
to
his
room
he
lighted
his
candle
and
sat
down
by
his
desk
with
his
head
in
his
hands
and
stayed
so
for
a
long
time
without
a
thought
then
he
sighed
and
went
to
bed
next
day
when
he
got
up
mechanically
he
went
to
his
window
to
look
down
into
sabine
room
but
the
curtains
were
drawn
they
were
drawn
the
whole
morning
they
were
drawn
ever
after
next
evening
christophe
proposed
to
his
mother
that
they
should
go
again
to
sit
by
the
door
he
did
so
regularly
louisa
was
glad
of
it
she
did
not
like
his
shutting
himself
up
in
his
room
immediately
after
dinner
with
the
window
and
shutters
the
little
silent
shadow
never
failed
to
come
and
sit
in
its
usual
place
they
gave
each
other
a
quick
nod
which
louisa
never
noticed
christophe
would
talk
to
his
mother
sabine
would
smile
at
her
little
girl
playing
in
the
street
about
nine
she
would
go
and
put
her
to
bed
and
would
then
return
noiselessly
if
she
stayed
a
little
christophe
would
begin
to
be
afraid
that
she
would
not
come
back
he
would
listen
for
sounds
in
the
house
the
laughter
of
the
little
girl
who
would
not
go
to
sleep
he
would
hear
the
rustling
of
sabine
dress
before
she
appeared
on
the
threshold
of
the
shop
then
he
would
look
away
and
talk
to
his
mother
more
eagerly
sometimes
he
would
feel
that
sabine
was
looking
at
him
in
turn
he
would
furtively
look
at
her
but
their
eyes
would
never
meet
the
child
was
a
bond
between
them
she
would
run
about
in
the
street
with
other
children
they
would
find
amusement
in
teasing
a
dog
sleeping
there
with
his
nose
in
his
paws
he
would
cock
a
red
eye
and
at
last
would
emit
a
growl
of
boredom
then
they
would
fly
this
way
and
that
screaming
in
terror
and
happiness
the
little
girl
would
give
piercing
shrieks
and
look
behind
her
as
though
she
were
being
pursued
she
would
throw
herself
into
louisa
lap
and
louisa
would
smile
fondly
she
would
keep
the
child
and
question
her
and
so
she
would
enter
into
conversation
with
sabine
christophe
never
joined
in
he
never
spoke
to
sabine
sabine
never
spoke
to
him
by
tacit
agreement
they
pretended
to
ignore
each
other
but
he
never
lost
a
word
of
what
they
said
as
they
talked
over
him
his
silence
seemed
unfriendly
to
louisa
sabine
never
thought
it
so
but
it
would
make
her
shy
and
she
would
grow
confused
in
her
remarks
then
she
would
find
some
excuse
for
going
in
for
a
whole
week
louisa
kept
indoors
for
a
cold
christophe
and
sabine
were
left
alone
the
first
time
they
were
frightened
by
it
sabine
to
seem
at
her
ease
took
her
little
girl
on
her
knees
and
loaded
her
with
caresses
christophe
was
embarrassed
and
did
not
know
whether
he
ought
to
go
on
ignoring
what
was
happening
at
his
side
it
became
difficult
although
they
had
not
spoken
a
single
word
to
each
other
they
did
know
each
other
thanks
to
louisa
he
tried
to
begin
several
times
but
the
words
stuck
in
his
throat
once
more
the
little
girl
extricated
them
from
their
difficulty
she
played
and
went
round
christophe
chair
he
caught
her
as
she
passed
and
kissed
her
he
was
not
very
fond
of
children
but
it
was
curiously
pleasant
to
him
to
kiss
the
little
girl
she
struggled
to
be
free
for
she
was
busy
with
her
game
he
teased
her
she
bit
his
hands
he
let
her
fall
sabine
laughed
they
looked
at
the
child
and
exchanged
a
few
trivial
words
then
christophe
tried
he
thought
he
must
to
enter
into
conversation
but
he
had
nothing
very
much
to
go
upon
and
sabine
did
not
make
his
task
any
the
easier
she
only
repeated
what
he
said
it
is
a
fine
evening
yes
it
is
a
very
fine
evening
impossible
to
breathe
in
the
yard
yes
the
yard
was
stifling
conversation
became
very
difficult
sabine
discovered
that
it
was
time
to
take
the
little
girl
in
and
went
in
herself
and
she
did
not
appear
again
christophe
was
afraid
she
would
do
the
same
on
the
evenings
that
followed
and
that
she
would
avoid
being
left
alone
with
him
as
long
as
louisa
was
not
there
but
on
the
contrary
the
next
evening
sabine
tried
to
resume
their
conversation
she
did
so
deliberately
rather
than
for
pleasure
she
was
obviously
taking
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
find
subjects
of
conversation
and
bored
with
the
questions
she
put
questions
and
answers
came
between
heartbreaking
silences
christophe
remembered
his
first
interviews
with
otto
but
with
sabine
their
subjects
were
even
more
limited
than
then
and
she
had
not
otto
patience
when
she
saw
the
small
success
of
her
endeavors
she
did
not
try
any
more
she
had
to
give
herself
too
much
trouble
and
she
lost
interest
in
it
she
said
no
more
and
he
followed
her
lead
and
then
there
was
sweet
peace
again
the
night
was
calm
once
more
and
they
returned
to
their
inward
thoughts
sabine
rocked
slowly
in
her
chair
dreaming
christophe
also
was
dreaming
they
said
nothing
after
half
an
hour
christophe
began
to
talk
to
himself
and
in
a
low
voice
cried
out
with
pleasure
in
the
delicious
scent
brought
by
the
soft
wind
that
came
from
a
cart
of
strawberries
sabine
said
a
word
or
two
in
reply
again
they
were
silent
they
were
enjoying
the
charm
of
these
indefinite
silences
and
trivial
words
their
dreams
were
the
same
they
had
but
one
thought
they
did
not
know
what
it
was
they
did
not
admit
it
to
themselves
at
eleven
they
smiled
and
parted
next
day
they
did
not
even
try
to
talk
they
resumed
their
sweet
silence
at
long
intervals
a
word
or
two
let
them
know
that
they
were
thinking
of
the
same
things
sabine
began
to
laugh
how
much
better
it
is
she
said
not
to
try
to
talk
one
thinks
one
must
and
it
is
so
tiresome
ah
said
christophe
with
conviction
if
only
everybody
thought
the
same
they
both
laughed
they
were
thinking
of
frau
vogel
poor
woman
said
sabine
how
exhausting
she
is
she
is
never
exhausted
replied
christophe
gloomily
she
was
tickled
by
his
manner
and
his
jest
you
think
it
amusing
he
asked
that
is
easy
for
you
you
are
sheltered
so
i
am
said
sabine
i
lock
myself
in
she
had
a
little
soft
laugh
that
hardly
sounded
christophe
heard
it
with
delight
in
the
calm
of
the
evening
he
snuffed
the
fresh
air
luxuriously
ah
it
is
good
to
be
silent
he
said
stretching
his
limbs
and
talking
is
no
use
said
she
yes
returned
christophe
we
understand
each
other
so
well
they
relapsed
into
silence
in
the
darkness
they
could
not
see
each
other
they
were
both
smiling
and
yet
though
they
felt
the
same
when
they
were
together
or
imagined
that
they
did
in
reality
they
knew
nothing
of
each
other
sabine
did
not
bother
about
it
christophe
was
more
curious
one
evening
he
asked
her
do
you
like
music
no
she
said
simply
it
bores
me
i
do
understand
it
her
frankness
charmed
him
he
was
sick
of
the
lies
of
people
who
said
that
they
were
mad
about
music
and
were
bored
to
death
when
they
heard
it
and
it
seemed
to
him
almost
a
virtue
not
to
like
it
and
to
say
so
he
asked
if
sabine
read
so
she
had
no
books
he
offered
to
lend
her
his
serious
books
she
asked
uneasily
not
serious
books
if
she
did
not
want
them
poetry
but
those
are
serious
books
novels
then
she
pouted
they
do
interest
you
yes
she
was
interested
in
them
but
they
were
always
too
long
she
never
had
the
patience
to
finish
them
she
forgot
the
beginning
skipped
chapters
and
then
lost
the
thread
and
then
she
threw
the
book
away
fine
interest
you
take
bah
enough
for
a
story
that
is
not
true
she
kept
her
interest
for
better
things
than
books
for
the
theater
then
no
no
did
she
go
to
the
theater
no
it
was
too
hot
there
were
too
many
people
so
much
better
at
home
the
lights
tired
her
eyes
and
the
actors
were
so
ugly
he
agreed
with
her
in
that
but
there
were
other
things
in
the
theater
the
play
for
instance
yes
she
said
absently
but
i
have
no
time
what
do
you
do
all
day
she
smiled
there
is
so
much
to
do
true
said
he
there
is
your
shop
oh
she
said
calmly
that
does
not
take
much
time
your
little
girl
takes
up
your
time
then
oh
no
poor
child
she
is
very
good
and
plays
by
herself
then
he
begged
pardon
for
his
indiscretion
but
she
was
amused
by
it
there
are
so
many
things
what
things
she
could
not
say
all
sorts
of
things
getting
up
dressing
thinking
of
dinner
cooking
dinner
eating
dinner
thinking
of
supper
cleaning
her
room
and
then
the
day
was
over
and
besides
you
must
have
a
little
time
for
doing
nothing
and
you
are
not
bored
never
even
when
you
are
doing
nothing
especially
when
i
am
doing
nothing
it
is
much
worse
doing
something
that
bores
me
they
looked
at
each
other
and
laughed
you
are
very
happy
said
christophe
i
ca
do
nothing
it
seems
to
me
that
you
know
how
i
have
been
learning
lately
ah
well
you
learn
when
he
left
off
talking
to
her
he
was
at
his
ease
and
comfortable
it
was
enough
for
him
to
see
her
he
was
rid
of
his
anxieties
and
irritations
and
the
nervous
trouble
that
made
him
sick
at
heart
when
he
was
talking
to
her
he
was
beyond
care
and
so
when
he
thought
of
her
he
dared
not
admit
it
to
himself
but
as
soon
as
he
was
in
her
presence
he
was
filled
with
a
delicious
soft
emotion
that
brought
him
almost
to
unconsciousness
at
night
he
slept
as
he
had
never
done
when
he
came
back
from
his
work
he
would
look
into
this
shop
it
was
not
often
that
he
did
not
see
sabine
they
bowed
and
smiled
sometimes
she
was
at
the
door
and
then
they
would
exchange
a
few
words
and
he
would
open
the
door
and
call
the
little
girl
and
hand
her
a
packet
of
sweets
one
day
he
decided
to
go
in
he
pretended
that
he
wanted
some
waistcoat
buttons
she
began
to
look
for
them
but
she
could
not
find
them
all
the
buttons
were
mixed
up
it
was
impossible
to
pick
them
out
she
was
a
little
put
out
that
he
should
see
her
untidiness
he
laughed
at
it
and
bent
over
the
better
to
see
it
no
she
said
trying
to
hide
the
drawers
with
her
hands
do
look
it
is
a
dreadful
muddle
she
went
on
looking
but
christophe
embarrassed
her
she
was
cross
and
as
she
pushed
the
drawer
back
she
said
i
ca
find
any
go
to
lisi
in
the
next
street
she
is
sure
to
have
them
she
has
everything
that
people
want
he
laughed
at
her
way
of
doing
business
do
you
send
all
your
customers
away
like
that
well
you
are
not
the
first
said
sabine
warmly
and
yet
she
was
a
little
ashamed
it
is
too
much
trouble
to
tidy
up
she
said
i
put
off
doing
it
from
day
to
day
but
i
shall
certainly
do
it
shall
i
help
you
asked
christophe
she
refused
she
would
gladly
have
accepted
but
she
dared
not
for
fear
of
gossip
and
besides
it
humiliated
her
they
went
on
talking
and
your
buttons
she
said
to
christophe
a
moment
later
are
you
going
to
lisi
never
said
christophe
i
shall
wait
until
you
have
tidied
up
oh
said
sabine
who
had
already
forgotten
what
she
had
just
said
wait
all
that
time
her
frankness
delighted
them
both
christophe
went
to
the
drawer
that
she
had
shut
let
me
look
she
ran
to
prevent
his
doing
so
no
now
please
i
am
sure
i
have
any
i
bet
you
have
at
once
he
found
the
button
he
wanted
and
was
triumphant
he
wanted
others
he
wanted
to
go
on
rummaging
but
she
snatched
the
box
from
his
hands
and
hurt
in
her
vanity
she
began
to
look
herself
the
light
was
fading
she
went
to
the
window
christophe
sat
a
little
away
from
her
the
little
girl
clambered
on
to
his
knees
he
pretended
to
listen
to
her
chatter
and
answered
her
absently
he
was
looking
at
sabine
and
she
knew
that
he
was
looking
at
her
she
bent
over
the
box
he
could
see
her
neck
and
a
little
of
her
and
as
he
looked
he
saw
that
she
was
blushing
and
he
blushed
too
the
child
went
on
talking
no
one
answered
her
sabine
did
not
move
christophe
could
not
see
what
she
was
doing
he
was
sure
she
was
doing
nothing
she
was
not
even
looking
at
the
box
in
her
hands
the
silence
went
on
and
on
the
little
girl
grew
uneasy
and
slipped
down
from
knees
why
do
you
say
anything
sabine
turned
sharply
and
took
her
in
her
arms
the
box
was
spilled
on
the
floor
the
little
girl
shouted
with
glee
and
ran
on
hands
and
knees
after
the
buttons
rolling
under
the
furniture
sabine
went
to
the
window
again
and
laid
her
cheek
against
the
pane
she
seemed
to
be
absorbed
in
what
she
saw
outside
said
christophe
ill
at
ease
she
did
not
turn
her
head
and
said
in
a
low
voice
on
sundays
the
house
was
empty
during
the
afternoon
the
whole
family
went
to
church
for
vespers
sabine
did
not
go
christophe
jokingly
reproached
her
with
it
once
when
he
saw
her
sitting
at
her
door
in
the
little
garden
while
the
lovely
bells
were
bawling
themselves
hoarse
summoning
her
she
replied
in
the
same
tone
that
only
mass
was
compulsory
not
vespers
it
was
then
no
use
and
perhaps
a
little
indiscreet
to
be
too
zealous
and
she
liked
to
think
that
god
would
be
rather
pleased
than
angry
with
her
you
have
made
god
in
your
own
image
said
christophe
i
should
be
so
bored
if
i
were
in
his
place
replied
she
with
conviction
you
would
not
bother
much
about
the
world
if
you
were
in
his
place
all
that
i
should
ask
of
it
would
be
that
it
should
not
bother
itself
about
me
perhaps
it
would
be
none
the
worse
for
that
said
christophe
tssh
cried
sabine
we
are
being
irreligious
i
do
see
anything
irreligious
in
saying
that
god
is
like
you
i
am
sure
he
is
flattered
will
you
be
silent
said
sabine
half
laughing
half
angry
she
was
beginning
to
be
afraid
that
god
would
be
scandalized
she
quickly
turned
the
conversation
besides
she
said
it
is
the
only
time
in
the
week
when
one
can
enjoy
the
garden
in
peace
yes
said
christophe
they
are
gone
they
looked
at
each
other
how
silent
it
is
muttered
sabine
we
are
not
used
to
it
one
hardly
knows
where
one
is
oh
cried
christophe
suddenly
and
angrily
there
are
days
when
i
would
like
to
strangle
her
there
was
no
need
to
ask
of
whom
he
was
speaking
and
the
others
asked
sabine
gaily
true
said
christophe
a
little
abashed
there
is
rosa
poor
child
said
sabine
they
were
silent
if
only
it
were
always
as
it
is
now
sighed
christophe
she
raised
her
laughing
eyes
to
his
and
then
dropped
them
he
saw
that
she
was
working
what
are
you
doing
he
asked
the
fence
of
ivy
that
separated
the
two
gardens
was
between
them
look
she
said
lifting
a
basin
that
she
was
holding
in
heir
lap
i
am
shelling
peas
she
sighed
but
that
is
not
unpleasant
he
raid
laughing
oh
she
replied
it
is
disgusting
always
having
to
think
of
dinner
i
bet
that
if
it
were
possible
he
said
you
would
go
without
your
dinner
rather
than
haw
the
trouble
of
cooking
it
that
true
cried
she
wait
i
come
and
help
you
he
climbed
over
the
fence
and
came
to
her
she
was
sitting
in
a
chair
in
the
door
he
sat
on
a
step
at
her
feet
he
dipped
into
her
lap
for
handfuls
of
green
pods
and
he
poured
the
little
round
peas
into
the
basin
that
sabine
held
between
her
knees
he
looked
down
he
saw
sabine
black
stockings
clinging
to
her
ankles
and
feet
one
of
her
feet
was
half
out
of
its
shoe
he
dared
not
raise
his
eyes
to
look
at
her
the
air
was
heavy
the
sky
was
dull
and
clouds
hung
low
there
was
no
wind
no
leaf
stirred
the
garden
was
inclosed
within
high
walls
there
was
no
world
beyond
them
the
child
had
gone
out
with
one
of
the
neighbors
they
were
alone
they
said
nothing
they
could
say
nothing
without
looking
he
went
on
taking
handfuls
of
peas
from
sabine
lap
his
fingers
trembled
as
he
touched
her
among
the
fresh
smooth
pods
they
met
sabine
fingers
and
they
trembled
too
they
could
not
go
on
they
sat
still
not
looking
at
each
other
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
with
her
lips
and
her
arms
hanging
he
sat
at
her
feet
leaning
against
her
along
his
shoulder
and
arm
he
could
feel
the
warmth
of
sabine
leg
they
were
breathless
christophe
laid
his
hands
against
the
stones
to
cool
them
one
of
his
hands
touched
foot
that
she
had
thrust
out
of
her
shoe
and
he
left
it
there
could
not
move
it
they
shivered
almost
they
lost
control
christophe
hand
closed
on
the
slender
toes
of
sabine
little
foot
sabine
turned
cold
the
sweat
broke
out
on
her
brow
she
leaned
towards
christophe
familiar
voices
broke
the
spell
they
trembled
christophe
leaped
to
his
feet
and
crossed
the
fence
again
sabine
picked
up
the
shells
in
her
lap
and
went
in
in
the
yard
he
turned
she
was
at
her
door
they
looked
at
each
other
drops
of
rain
were
beginning
to
patter
on
the
leaves
of
the
trees
she
closed
her
door
frau
vogel
and
rosa
came
in
he
went
up
to
his
room
in
the
yellow
light
of
the
waning
day
drowned
in
the
torrents
of
rain
he
got
up
from
his
desk
in
response
to
an
irresistible
impulse
he
ran
to
his
window
and
held
out
his
arms
to
the
opposite
window
at
the
same
moment
through
the
opposite
window
in
the
of
the
room
he
saw
he
thought
he
saw
sabine
holding
out
her
arms
to
him
he
rushed
from
his
room
he
went
downstairs
he
ran
to
the
garden
fence
at
the
risk
of
being
seen
he
was
about
to
clear
it
but
when
he
looked
at
the
window
at
which
she
had
appeared
he
saw
that
the
shutters
were
closed
the
house
seemed
to
be
asleep
he
stopped
old
euler
going
to
his
cellar
saw
him
and
called
him
he
retraced
his
footsteps
he
thought
he
must
have
been
dreaming
it
was
not
long
before
rosa
began
to
see
what
was
happening
she
had
no
diffidence
and
she
did
not
yet
know
what
jealousy
was
she
was
ready
to
give
wholly
and
to
ask
nothing
in
return
but
if
she
was
sorrowfully
resigned
to
not
being
loved
by
christophe
she
had
never
considered
the
possibility
of
christophe
loving
another
one
evening
after
dinner
she
had
just
finished
a
piece
of
embroidery
at
which
she
had
been
working
for
months
she
was
happy
and
wanted
for
once
in
a
way
to
leave
her
work
and
go
and
talk
to
christophe
she
waited
until
her
mother
back
was
turned
and
then
slipped
from
the
room
she
crept
from
the
house
like
a
truant
she
wanted
to
go
and
confound
christophe
who
had
vowed
scornfully
that
she
would
never
finish
her
work
she
thought
it
would
be
a
good
joke
to
go
and
take
them
by
surprise
in
the
street
it
was
no
use
the
poor
child
knowing
how
christophe
felt
towards
her
she
was
always
inclined
to
measure
the
pleasure
which
others
should
have
at
seeing
her
by
that
which
she
had
herself
in
meeting
them
she
went
out
christophe
and
sabine
were
sitting
as
usual
in
front
of
the
house
there
was
a
catch
at
rosa
heart
and
yet
she
did
not
stop
for
the
irrational
idea
that
was
in
her
and
she
chaffed
christophe
warmly
the
sound
of
her
shrill
voice
in
the
silence
of
the
night
struck
on
christophe
like
a
false
note
he
started
in
his
chair
and
frowned
angrily
rosa
waved
her
embroidery
in
his
face
triumphantly
christophe
snubbed
her
impatiently
it
is
finished
finished
insisted
rosa
oh
well
go
and
begin
another
said
christophe
curtly
rosa
was
crestfallen
all
her
delight
vanished
christophe
went
on
crossly
and
when
you
have
done
thirty
when
you
are
very
old
you
will
at
least
be
able
to
say
to
yourself
that
your
life
has
not
been
wasted
rosa
was
near
weeping
how
cross
you
are
christophe
she
said
christophe
was
ashamed
and
spoke
kindly
to
her
she
was
satisfied
with
so
little
that
she
regained
confidence
and
she
began
once
more
to
chatter
noisily
she
could
not
speak
low
she
shouted
deafeningly
like
everybody
in
the
house
in
spite
of
himself
christophe
could
not
conceal
his
at
first
he
answered
her
with
a
few
irritated
monosyllables
then
he
said
nothing
at
all
turned
his
back
on
her
fidgeted
in
his
chair
and
ground
his
teeth
as
she
rattled
on
rosa
saw
that
he
was
losing
his
temper
and
knew
that
she
ought
to
stop
but
she
went
on
louder
than
ever
sabine
a
few
yards
away
in
the
dark
said
nothing
watched
the
scene
with
ironic
impassivity
then
she
was
weary
and
feeling
that
the
evening
was
wasted
she
got
up
and
went
in
christophe
only
noticed
her
departure
after
she
had
gone
he
got
up
at
once
and
without
ceremony
went
away
with
a
curt
rosa
was
left
alone
in
the
street
and
looked
in
bewilderment
at
the
door
by
which
he
had
just
gone
in
tears
came
to
her
eyes
she
rushed
in
went
up
to
her
room
without
a
sound
so
as
not
to
have
to
talk
to
her
mother
undressed
hurriedly
and
when
she
was
in
her
bed
buried
under
the
clothes
sobbed
and
sobbed
she
made
no
attempt
to
think
over
what
had
passed
she
did
not
ask
herself
whether
christophe
loved
sabine
or
whether
christophe
and
sabine
could
not
bear
her
she
knew
only
that
all
was
lost
that
life
was
useless
that
there
was
nothing
left
to
her
but
death
next
morning
thought
came
to
her
once
more
with
eternal
illusive
hope
she
recalled
the
events
of
the
evening
and
told
herself
that
she
was
wrong
to
attach
so
much
importance
to
them
no
doubt
christophe
did
not
love
her
she
was
resigned
to
that
though
in
her
heart
she
thought
though
she
did
not
admit
the
thought
that
in
the
end
she
would
win
his
love
by
her
love
for
him
but
what
reason
had
she
for
thinking
that
there
was
anything
between
sabine
and
him
how
could
he
so
clever
as
he
was
love
a
little
creature
whose
insignificance
and
mediocrity
were
patent
she
was
reassured
but
for
that
she
did
not
watch
christophe
any
the
less
closely
she
saw
nothing
all
day
because
there
was
nothing
to
see
but
christophe
seeing
her
prowling
about
him
all
day
long
without
any
sort
of
explanation
was
peculiarly
irritated
by
it
she
set
the
crown
on
her
efforts
in
the
evening
when
she
appeared
again
and
sat
with
them
in
the
street
the
scene
of
the
previous
evening
was
repeated
rosa
talked
alone
but
sabine
did
not
wait
so
long
before
she
went
indoors
and
christophe
followed
her
example
rosa
could
no
longer
pretend
that
her
presence
was
not
unwelcome
but
the
unhappy
girl
tried
to
deceive
herself
she
did
not
perceive
that
she
could
have
done
nothing
worse
than
to
try
so
to
impose
on
herself
and
with
her
usual
clumsiness
she
went
on
through
the
succeeding
days
next
day
with
rosa
sitting
by
his
side
christophe
waited
is
vain
for
sabine
to
appear
the
day
after
rosa
was
alone
they
had
given
up
the
struggle
but
she
gained
nothing
by
it
save
resentment
from
christophe
who
was
furious
at
being
robbed
of
his
beloved
evenings
his
only
happiness
he
was
the
less
inclined
to
forgive
her
for
being
absorbed
with
his
own
feelings
he
had
no
suspicion
of
rosa
sabine
had
known
them
for
some
time
she
knew
that
rosa
was
jealous
even
before
she
knew
that
she
herself
was
in
love
but
she
said
nothing
about
it
and
with
the
natural
cruelty
of
a
pretty
woman
who
is
certain
of
her
victory
in
quizzical
silence
she
watched
the
futile
efforts
of
her
awkward
rival
left
mistress
of
the
field
of
battle
rosa
gazed
piteously
upon
the
results
of
her
tactics
the
best
thing
she
could
have
done
would
have
been
not
to
persist
and
to
leave
christophe
alone
at
least
for
the
time
being
but
that
was
not
what
she
did
and
as
the
worst
thing
she
could
have
done
was
to
talk
to
him
about
sabine
that
was
precisely
what
she
did
with
a
fluttering
at
her
heart
by
way
of
sounding
him
she
said
timidly
that
sabine
was
pretty
christophe
replied
curtly
that
she
was
very
pretty
and
although
rosa
might
have
foreseen
the
reply
she
would
provoke
her
heart
thumped
when
she
heard
him
she
knew
that
sabine
was
pretty
but
she
had
never
particularly
remarked
it
now
she
saw
her
for
the
first
time
with
the
eyes
of
christophe
she
saw
her
delicate
features
her
short
nose
her
fine
mouth
her
slender
figure
her
graceful
movements
ah
how
sad
what
would
not
she
have
given
to
possess
sabine
body
and
live
in
it
she
did
not
go
closely
into
why
it
should
be
preferred
to
her
own
her
own
what
had
she
done
to
possess
such
a
body
what
a
burden
it
was
upon
her
how
ugly
it
seemed
to
her
it
was
odious
to
her
and
to
think
that
nothing
but
death
could
ever
free
her
from
it
she
was
at
once
too
proud
and
too
humble
to
complain
that
she
was
not
loved
she
had
no
right
to
do
so
and
she
tried
even
more
to
humble
herself
but
her
instinct
revolted
no
it
was
not
just
why
should
she
have
such
a
body
she
and
not
sabine
and
why
should
sabine
be
loved
what
had
she
done
to
be
loved
rosa
saw
her
with
no
kindly
eye
lazy
careless
egoistic
indifferent
towards
everybody
not
looking
after
her
house
or
her
child
or
anybody
loving
only
herself
living
only
for
sleeping
dawdling
and
doing
nothing
and
it
was
such
a
woman
who
pleased
who
pleased
christophe
christophe
who
was
so
severe
christophe
who
was
so
discerning
christophe
whom
she
esteemed
and
admired
more
than
anybody
how
could
christophe
be
blind
to
it
she
could
not
help
from
time
to
time
dropping
an
unkind
remark
about
sabine
in
his
hearing
she
did
not
wish
to
do
so
but
the
impulse
was
stronger
than
herself
she
was
always
sorry
for
it
for
she
was
a
kind
creature
and
disliked
speaking
ill
of
anybody
but
she
was
the
more
sorry
because
she
drew
down
on
herself
such
cruel
replies
as
showed
how
much
christophe
was
in
love
he
did
not
mince
matters
hurt
in
his
love
he
tried
to
hurt
in
return
and
succeeded
rosa
would
make
no
reply
and
go
out
with
her
head
bowed
and
her
lips
tight
pressed
to
keep
from
crying
she
thought
that
it
was
her
own
fault
that
she
deserved
it
for
having
hurt
christophe
by
attacking
the
object
of
his
love
her
mother
was
less
patient
frau
vogel
who
saw
everything
and
old
euler
also
had
not
been
slow
to
notice
christophe
interviews
with
their
young
neighbor
it
was
not
difficult
to
guess
their
romance
their
secret
projects
of
one
day
marrying
rosa
to
christophe
were
set
at
naught
by
it
and
that
seemed
to
them
a
personal
affront
of
christophe
although
he
was
not
supposed
to
know
that
they
had
disposed
of
him
without
consulting
his
wishes
but
amalia
despotism
did
not
admit
of
ideas
contrary
to
her
own
and
it
seemed
scandalous
to
her
that
christophe
should
have
disregarded
the
contemptuous
opinion
she
had
often
expressed
of
sabine
she
did
not
hesitate
to
repeat
it
for
his
benefit
whenever
he
was
present
she
found
some
excuse
for
talking
about
her
neighbor
she
cast
about
for
the
most
injurious
things
to
say
of
her
things
which
might
sting
christophe
most
cruelly
and
with
the
crudity
of
her
point
of
view
and
language
she
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
them
the
ferocious
instinct
of
a
woman
so
superior
to
that
of
a
man
in
the
art
of
doing
evil
as
well
as
of
doing
good
made
her
insist
less
on
sabine
laziness
and
moral
failings
than
on
her
uncleanliness
her
indiscreet
and
prying
eye
had
watched
through
the
window
for
proofs
of
it
in
the
secret
processes
of
toilet
and
she
exposed
them
with
coarse
complacency
when
from
decency
she
could
not
say
everything
she
left
the
more
to
be
understood
christophe
would
go
pale
with
shame
and
anger
he
would
go
white
as
a
sheet
and
his
lips
would
quiver
rosa
foreseeing
what
must
happen
would
implore
her
mother
to
have
done
she
would
even
try
to
defend
sabine
but
she
only
succeeded
in
making
amalia
more
aggressive
and
suddenly
christophe
would
leap
from
his
chair
he
would
thump
on
the
table
and
begin
to
shout
that
it
was
monstrous
to
speak
of
a
woman
to
spy
upon
her
to
expose
her
misfortunes
only
an
evil
mind
could
so
persecute
a
creature
who
was
good
charming
quiet
keeping
herself
to
herself
and
doing
no
harm
to
anybody
and
speaking
no
ill
of
anybody
but
they
were
making
a
great
mistake
if
they
thought
they
could
do
her
harm
they
only
made
him
more
sympathetic
and
made
her
kindness
shine
forth
only
the
more
clearly
amalia
would
feel
then
that
she
had
gone
too
far
but
she
was
hurt
by
feeling
it
and
shifting
her
ground
she
would
say
that
it
was
only
too
easy
to
talk
of
kindness
that
the
word
was
called
in
as
an
excuse
for
everything
heavens
it
was
easy
enough
to
be
thought
kind
when
you
never
bothered
about
anything
or
anybody
and
never
did
your
duty
to
which
christophe
would
reply
that
the
first
duty
of
all
was
to
make
life
pleasant
for
others
but
that
there
were
people
for
whom
duty
meant
only
ugliness
unpleasantness
tiresomeness
and
everything
that
interferes
with
the
liberty
of
others
and
annoys
and
injures
their
neighbors
their
servants
their
families
and
themselves
god
save
us
from
such
people
and
such
a
notion
of
duty
as
from
the
plague
they
would
grow
venomous
amalia
would
be
very
bitter
christophe
would
not
budge
an
and
the
result
of
it
all
was
that
henceforth
christophe
made
a
point
of
being
seen
continually
with
sabine
he
would
go
and
knock
at
her
door
he
would
talk
gaily
and
laugh
with
her
he
would
choose
moments
when
amalia
and
rosa
could
see
him
amalia
would
avenge
herself
with
angry
words
but
the
innocent
rosa
heart
was
rent
and
torn
by
this
refinement
of
cruelty
she
felt
that
he
detested
them
and
wished
to
avenge
himself
and
she
wept
bitterly
so
christophe
who
had
suffered
so
much
from
injustice
learned
unjustly
to
inflict
suffering
some
time
after
that
sabine
brother
a
miller
at
landegg
a
little
town
a
few
miles
away
was
to
celebrate
the
christening
of
a
child
sabine
was
to
be
godmother
she
invited
christophe
he
had
no
liking
for
these
functions
but
for
the
pleasure
of
annoying
the
vogels
and
of
being
with
sabine
he
accepted
eagerly
sabine
gave
herself
the
malicious
satisfaction
of
inviting
amalia
and
rosa
also
being
quite
sure
that
they
would
refuse
they
did
rosa
was
longing
to
accept
she
did
not
dislike
sabine
sometimes
even
her
heart
was
filled
with
tenderness
for
her
because
christophe
loved
her
sometimes
she
longed
to
tell
her
so
and
to
throw
her
arms
about
her
neck
but
there
was
her
mother
and
her
mother
example
she
stiffened
herself
in
her
pride
and
refused
then
when
they
had
gone
and
she
thought
of
them
together
happy
together
driving
in
the
country
on
the
lovely
july
day
while
she
was
left
shut
up
in
her
room
with
a
pile
of
linen
to
mend
with
her
mother
grumbling
by
her
side
she
thought
she
must
choke
and
she
cursed
her
pride
oh
if
there
were
still
time
alas
if
it
were
all
to
do
again
she
would
have
done
the
same
the
miller
had
sent
his
wagonette
to
fetch
christophe
and
sabine
they
took
up
several
guests
from
the
town
and
the
farms
on
the
it
was
fresh
dry
weather
the
bright
sun
made
the
red
berries
of
the
brown
trees
by
the
road
and
the
wild
cherry
trees
in
the
fields
shine
sabine
was
smiling
her
pale
face
was
rosy
under
the
keen
wind
christophe
had
her
little
girl
on
his
knees
they
did
not
try
to
talk
to
each
other
they
talked
to
their
neighbors
without
caring
to
whom
or
of
what
they
were
glad
to
hear
each
other
voices
they
were
glad
to
be
driving
in
the
same
carriage
they
looked
at
each
other
in
childish
glee
as
they
pointed
out
to
each
other
a
house
a
tree
a
passerby
sabine
loved
the
country
but
she
hardly
ever
went
into
it
her
incurable
laziness
made
excursions
impossible
it
was
almost
a
year
since
she
had
been
outside
the
town
and
so
she
delighted
in
the
smallest
things
she
saw
they
were
not
new
to
christophe
but
he
loved
sabine
and
like
all
lovers
he
saw
everything
through
her
eyes
and
felt
all
her
thrills
of
pleasure
and
all
and
more
than
the
emotion
that
was
in
her
for
merging
himself
with
his
beloved
he
endowed
her
with
all
that
he
was
himself
when
they
came
to
the
mill
they
found
in
the
yard
all
the
people
of
the
farm
and
the
other
guests
who
received
them
with
a
deafening
noise
the
fowls
the
ducks
and
the
dogs
joined
in
the
miller
bertold
a
great
fellow
square
of
head
and
shoulders
as
big
and
tall
as
sabine
was
slight
took
his
little
sister
in
his
arms
and
put
her
down
gently
as
though
he
were
afraid
of
breaking
her
it
was
not
long
before
christophe
saw
that
the
little
sister
as
usual
did
just
as
she
liked
with
the
giant
and
that
while
he
made
heavy
fun
of
her
whims
and
her
laziness
and
her
thousand
and
one
failings
he
was
at
her
feet
her
slave
she
was
used
to
it
and
thought
it
natural
she
did
nothing
to
win
love
it
seemed
to
her
right
that
she
should
be
loved
and
if
she
were
not
did
not
care
that
is
why
everybody
loved
her
christophe
made
another
discovery
not
so
pleasing
for
a
christening
a
godfather
is
necessary
as
well
as
a
godmother
and
the
godfather
has
certain
rights
over
the
godmother
rights
which
he
does
not
often
renounce
especially
when
she
is
young
and
pretty
he
learned
this
suddenly
when
he
saw
a
farmer
with
fair
curly
hair
and
rings
in
his
ears
go
up
to
sabine
laughing
and
kiss
her
on
both
cheeks
instead
of
telling
himself
that
he
was
an
ass
to
have
forgotten
this
privilege
and
more
than
an
ass
to
be
huffy
about
it
he
was
cross
with
sabine
as
though
she
had
deliberately
drawn
him
into
the
snare
his
crossness
grew
worse
when
he
found
himself
separated
from
her
during
the
ceremony
sabine
turned
round
every
now
and
then
as
the
procession
wound
across
the
fields
and
threw
him
a
friendly
glance
he
pretended
not
to
see
it
she
felt
that
he
was
annoyed
and
guessed
why
but
it
did
not
trouble
her
it
amused
her
if
she
had
had
a
real
squabble
with
some
one
she
loved
in
spite
of
all
the
pain
it
might
have
caused
her
she
would
never
have
made
the
least
effort
to
break
down
any
misunderstanding
it
would
have
been
too
much
trouble
everything
would
come
right
if
it
were
only
left
alone
at
dinner
sitting
between
the
miller
wife
and
a
fat
girl
with
red
cheeks
whom
he
had
escorted
to
the
service
without
ever
paying
any
attention
to
her
it
occurred
to
christophe
to
turn
and
look
at
his
neighbor
and
finding
her
comely
out
of
revenge
he
flirted
desperately
with
her
with
the
idea
of
catching
sabine
attention
he
succeeded
but
sabine
was
not
the
sort
of
woman
to
be
jealous
of
anybody
or
anything
so
long
as
she
was
loved
she
did
not
care
whether
her
lover
did
or
did
not
pay
court
to
others
and
instead
of
being
angry
she
was
delighted
to
see
christophe
amusing
himself
from
the
other
end
of
the
table
she
gave
him
her
most
charming
smile
christophe
was
disgruntled
there
was
no
doubt
then
that
sabine
was
indifferent
to
him
and
he
relapsed
into
his
sulky
mood
from
which
nothing
could
draw
him
neither
the
soft
eyes
of
his
neighbor
nor
the
wine
that
he
drank
finally
when
he
was
half
asleep
he
asked
himself
angrily
what
on
earth
he
was
doing
at
such
an
interminable
orgy
and
did
not
hear
the
miller
propose
a
trip
on
the
water
to
take
certain
of
the
guests
home
nor
did
he
see
sabine
beckoning
him
to
come
with
her
so
that
they
should
be
in
the
same
boat
when
it
occurred
to
him
there
was
no
room
for
him
and
he
had
to
go
in
another
boat
this
fresh
mishap
was
not
likely
to
make
him
more
amiable
until
he
discovered
that
he
was
to
be
rid
of
almost
all
his
companions
on
the
way
then
he
relaxed
and
was
pleasant
besides
the
pleasant
afternoon
on
the
water
the
pleasure
of
rowing
the
merriment
of
these
good
people
rid
him
of
his
as
sabine
was
no
longer
there
he
lost
his
and
had
no
scruple
about
being
frankly
amused
like
the
others
they
were
in
their
boats
they
followed
each
other
closely
and
tried
to
pass
each
other
they
threw
laughing
insults
at
each
other
when
the
boats
bumped
christophe
saw
sabine
smiling
face
and
he
could
not
help
smiling
too
they
felt
that
peace
was
made
he
knew
that
very
soon
they
would
return
together
they
began
to
sing
part
songs
each
voice
took
up
a
line
in
time
and
the
refrain
was
taken
up
in
chorus
the
people
in
the
different
boats
some
way
from
each
other
now
echoed
each
other
the
notes
skimmed
over
the
water
like
birds
from
time
to
time
a
boat
would
go
in
to
the
bank
a
few
peasants
would
climb
out
they
would
stand
there
and
wave
to
the
boats
as
they
went
further
and
further
away
little
by
little
they
were
disbanded
one
by
one
voices
left
the
chorus
at
last
they
were
alone
christophe
sabine
and
the
miller
they
came
back
in
the
same
boat
floating
down
the
river
christophe
and
bertold
held
the
oars
but
they
did
not
row
sabine
sat
in
the
stern
facing
christophe
and
talked
to
her
brother
and
looked
at
christophe
talking
so
they
were
able
to
look
at
each
other
undisturbedly
they
could
never
have
done
so
had
the
words
ceased
to
flow
the
deceitful
words
seemed
to
say
it
is
not
you
that
i
see
but
their
eyes
said
to
each
other
who
are
you
who
are
you
you
that
i
love
you
that
i
love
whoever
you
be
the
sky
was
clouded
mists
rose
from
the
fields
the
river
steamed
the
sun
went
down
behind
the
clouds
sabine
shivered
and
wrapped
her
little
black
shawl
round
her
head
and
shoulders
she
seemed
to
be
tired
as
the
boat
hugging
the
bank
passed
under
the
spreading
branches
of
the
willows
she
closed
her
eyes
her
thin
face
was
pale
her
lips
were
sorrowful
she
did
not
stir
she
seemed
to
suffer
to
have
suffered
to
be
dead
christophe
heart
ached
he
leaned
over
to
her
she
opened
her
eyes
again
and
saw
christophe
uneasy
eyes
upon
her
and
she
smiled
into
them
it
was
like
a
ray
of
sunlight
to
him
he
asked
in
a
whisper
are
you
ill
she
shook
her
head
and
said
i
am
cold
the
two
men
put
their
overcoats
about
her
wrapped
up
her
feet
her
legs
her
knees
like
a
child
being
tucked
up
in
bed
she
suffered
it
arid
thanked
them
with
her
eyes
a
fine
cold
rain
was
beginning
to
fall
they
took
the
oars
and
went
quietly
home
heavy
clouds
hung
in
the
sky
the
river
was
inky
black
lights
showed
in
the
windows
of
the
houses
here
and
there
in
the
fields
when
they
reached
the
mill
the
rain
was
pouring
down
and
sabine
was
numbed
they
lit
a
large
fire
in
the
kitchen
and
waited
until
the
deluge
should
he
over
but
it
only
grew
worse
and
the
wind
rose
they
had
to
drive
three
miles
to
get
back
to
the
town
the
miller
declared
that
he
would
not
let
sabine
go
in
such
weather
and
he
proposed
that
they
should
both
spend
the
night
in
the
farmhouse
christophe
was
reluctant
to
accept
he
looked
at
sabine
for
counsel
but
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
fire
on
the
hearth
it
was
as
though
they
were
afraid
of
influencing
christophe
decision
but
when
christophe
had
said
yes
she
turned
to
him
and
she
was
blushing
or
was
it
the
reflection
of
the
fire
and
he
saw
that
she
was
pleased
a
jolly
evening
the
rain
stormed
outside
in
the
black
chimney
the
fire
darted
jets
of
golden
sparks
they
spun
round
and
round
their
fantastic
shapes
were
marked
against
the
wall
the
miller
showed
sabine
little
girl
how
to
make
shadows
with
her
hands
the
child
laughed
and
was
not
altogether
at
her
ease
sabine
leaned
over
the
fire
and
poked
it
mechanically
with
a
heavy
pair
of
tongs
she
was
a
little
weary
and
smiled
dreamily
while
without
listening
she
nodded
to
her
chatter
of
her
domestic
affairs
christophe
sat
in
the
shadow
by
the
miller
side
and
watched
sabine
smiling
he
knew
that
she
was
smiling
at
him
they
never
had
an
opportunity
of
being
alone
all
evening
or
of
looking
at
each
other
they
sought
none
they
parted
early
their
rooms
were
adjoining
and
communicated
by
a
door
christophe
examined
the
door
and
found
that
the
lock
was
on
sabine
side
he
went
to
bed
and
tried
to
sleep
the
rain
was
pattering
against
the
windows
the
wind
howled
in
the
chimney
on
the
floor
above
him
a
door
was
banging
outside
the
window
a
poplar
bent
and
groaned
under
the
tempest
christophe
could
not
close
his
eyes
he
was
thinking
that
he
was
under
the
same
roof
near
her
a
wall
only
divided
them
he
heard
no
sound
in
sabine
room
but
he
thought
he
could
see
her
he
sat
up
in
his
bed
and
called
to
her
in
a
low
voice
through
the
wall
tender
passionate
words
he
said
he
held
out
his
arms
to
her
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
was
holding
out
her
arms
to
him
in
his
heart
he
heard
the
beloved
voice
answering
him
repeating
his
words
calling
low
to
him
and
he
did
not
know
whether
it
was
he
who
asked
and
answered
all
the
questions
or
whether
it
was
really
she
who
spoke
the
voice
came
louder
the
call
to
him
he
could
not
resist
he
leaped
from
his
bed
he
groped
his
way
to
the
door
he
did
not
wish
to
open
it
he
was
reassured
by
the
closed
door
and
when
he
laid
his
hand
once
more
on
the
handle
he
found
that
the
door
was
opening
he
stopped
dead
he
closed
it
softly
he
opened
it
once
more
he
closed
it
again
was
it
not
closed
just
now
yes
he
was
sure
it
was
who
had
opened
it
his
heart
beat
so
that
he
choked
he
leaned
over
his
bed
and
sat
down
to
breathe
again
he
was
overwhelmed
by
his
passion
it
robbed
him
of
the
power
to
see
or
hear
or
move
his
whole
body
shook
he
was
in
terror
of
this
unknown
joy
for
which
for
months
he
had
been
craving
which
was
with
him
now
near
him
so
that
nothing
could
keep
it
from
him
suddenly
the
violent
boy
filled
with
love
was
afraid
of
these
desires
newly
realized
and
revolted
from
them
he
was
ashamed
of
them
ashamed
of
what
he
wished
to
do
he
was
too
much
in
love
to
dare
to
enjoy
what
he
loved
he
was
afraid
he
would
have
done
anything
to
escape
his
happiness
is
it
only
possible
to
love
to
love
at
the
cost
of
the
profanation
of
the
beloved
he
went
to
the
door
again
and
trembling
with
love
and
fear
with
his
hand
on
the
latch
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
open
it
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
standing
barefooted
on
the
tiled
floor
shivering
with
cold
was
sabine
so
they
stayed
for
how
long
minutes
hours
they
did
not
know
that
they
were
there
and
yet
they
did
know
they
held
out
their
arms
to
each
other
he
was
overwhelmed
by
a
love
so
great
that
he
had
not
the
courage
to
enter
she
called
to
him
waited
for
him
trembled
lest
he
should
enter
and
when
at
last
he
made
up
his
mind
to
enter
she
had
just
made
up
her
mind
to
turn
the
lock
again
then
he
cursed
himself
for
a
fool
he
leaned
against
the
door
with
all
his
strength
with
his
lips
to
the
lock
he
implored
her
open
he
called
to
sabine
in
a
whisper
she
could
hear
his
heated
breathing
she
stayed
motionless
near
the
door
she
was
frozen
her
teeth
were
chattering
she
had
no
strength
either
to
open
the
door
or
to
go
to
bed
again
the
storm
made
the
trees
crack
and
the
doors
in
the
house
bang
they
turned
away
and
went
to
their
beds
worn
out
sad
and
sick
at
heart
the
cocks
crowed
huskily
the
first
light
of
dawn
crept
through
the
wet
windows
a
wretched
pale
dawn
drowned
in
the
persistent
rain
christophe
got
up
as
soon
as
he
could
he
went
down
to
the
kitchen
and
talked
to
the
people
there
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
be
gone
and
was
afraid
of
being
left
alone
with
sabine
again
he
was
almost
relieved
when
the
miller
wife
said
that
sabine
was
unwell
and
had
caught
cold
during
the
drive
and
would
not
be
going
that
morning
his
journey
home
was
melancholy
he
refused
to
drive
and
walked
through
the
soaking
fields
in
the
yellow
mist
that
covered
the
earth
the
trees
the
houses
with
a
shroud
like
the
light
life
seemed
to
be
blotted
out
everything
loomed
like
a
specter
he
was
like
a
specter
himself
at
home
he
found
angry
faces
they
were
all
scandalized
at
his
having
passed
the
night
god
knows
where
with
sabine
he
shut
himself
up
in
his
room
and
applied
himself
to
his
work
sabine
returned
the
next
day
and
shut
herself
up
also
they
avoided
meeting
each
other
the
weather
was
still
wet
and
cold
neither
of
them
went
out
they
saw
each
other
through
their
closed
windows
sabine
was
wrapped
up
by
her
fire
dreaming
christophe
was
buried
in
his
papers
they
bowed
to
each
other
a
little
coldly
and
reservedly
and
then
pretended
to
be
absorbed
again
they
did
not
take
stock
of
what
they
were
feeling
they
were
angry
with
each
other
with
themselves
with
things
generally
the
night
at
the
farmhouse
had
been
thrust
aside
in
their
memories
they
were
ashamed
of
it
and
did
not
know
whether
they
were
more
ashamed
of
their
folly
or
of
not
having
yielded
to
it
it
was
painful
to
them
to
see
each
other
for
that
made
them
remember
things
from
which
they
wished
to
escape
and
by
joint
agreement
they
retired
into
the
depths
of
their
rooms
so
as
utterly
to
forget
each
other
but
that
was
impossible
and
they
suffered
keenly
under
the
secret
hostility
which
they
felt
was
between
them
christophe
was
haunted
by
the
expression
of
dumb
rancor
which
he
had
once
seen
in
sabine
cold
eyes
from
such
thoughts
her
suffering
was
not
less
in
vain
did
she
struggle
against
them
and
even
deny
them
she
could
not
rid
herself
of
them
they
were
augmented
by
her
shame
that
christophe
should
have
guessed
what
was
happening
within
her
and
the
shame
of
having
offered
herself
the
shame
of
having
offered
herself
without
having
given
christophe
gladly
accepted
an
opportunity
which
cropped
up
to
go
to
cologne
and
düsseldorf
for
some
concerts
he
was
glad
to
spend
two
or
three
weeks
away
from
home
preparation
for
the
concerts
and
the
composition
of
a
new
work
that
he
wished
to
play
at
them
took
up
all
his
time
and
he
succeeded
in
forgetting
his
obstinate
memories
they
disappeared
from
sabine
mind
too
and
she
fell
back
into
the
torpor
of
her
usual
life
they
came
to
think
of
each
other
with
indifference
had
they
really
loved
each
other
they
doubted
it
christophe
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
for
cologne
without
saying
to
sabine
on
the
evening
before
his
departure
they
were
brought
together
again
by
some
imperceptible
influence
it
was
one
of
the
sunday
afternoons
when
everybody
was
at
church
christophe
had
gone
out
too
to
make
his
final
preparations
for
the
journey
sabine
was
sitting
in
her
tiny
garden
warming
herself
in
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
christophe
came
home
he
was
in
a
hurry
and
his
first
inclination
when
he
saw
her
was
to
bow
and
pass
on
but
something
held
him
back
as
he
was
passing
was
it
sabine
paleness
or
some
indefinable
feeling
remorse
fear
tenderness
he
stopped
turned
to
sabine
and
leaning
over
the
fence
he
bade
her
without
replying
she
held
out
her
hand
her
smile
was
all
kindness
such
kindness
as
he
had
never
seen
in
her
her
gesture
seemed
to
say
peace
between
us
he
took
her
hand
over
the
fence
bent
over
it
and
kissed
it
she
made
no
attempt
to
withdraw
it
he
longed
to
go
down
on
his
knees
and
say
i
love
they
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
but
they
offered
no
explanation
after
a
moment
she
removed
her
hand
and
turned
her
head
he
turned
too
to
hide
his
emotion
then
they
looked
at
each
other
again
with
untroubled
eyes
the
sun
was
setting
subtle
shades
of
color
violet
orange
and
mauve
chased
across
the
cold
clear
sky
she
shivered
and
drew
her
shawl
closer
about
her
shoulders
with
a
movement
that
he
knew
well
he
asked
how
are
you
she
made
a
little
grimace
as
if
the
question
were
not
worth
answering
they
went
on
looking
at
each
other
and
were
happy
it
was
as
though
they
had
lost
and
had
just
found
each
other
again
at
last
he
broke
the
silence
and
said
i
am
going
away
there
was
alarm
in
sabine
eyes
going
away
she
said
he
added
quickly
oh
only
for
two
or
three
weeks
two
or
three
weeks
she
said
in
dismay
he
explained
that
he
was
engaged
for
the
concerts
but
that
when
he
came
back
he
would
not
stir
all
winter
winter
she
said
that
is
a
long
time
off
oh
no
it
will
soon
be
here
she
saddened
and
did
not
look
at
him
when
shall
we
meet
again
she
asked
a
moment
later
he
did
not
understand
the
question
he
had
already
answered
it
as
soon
as
i
come
back
in
a
fortnight
or
three
weeks
at
most
she
still
looked
dismayed
he
tried
to
tease
her
it
wo
be
long
for
you
he
said
you
will
sleep
yes
said
sabine
she
looked
down
she
tried
to
smile
but
her
eyes
trembled
christophe
she
said
suddenly
turning
towards
him
there
was
a
note
of
distress
in
her
voice
she
seemed
to
say
stay
do
go
he
took
her
hand
looked
at
her
did
not
understand
the
importance
she
attached
to
his
fortnight
absence
but
he
was
only
waiting
for
a
word
from
her
to
say
i
will
stay
and
just
as
she
was
going
to
speak
the
front
door
was
opened
and
rosa
appeared
sabine
withdrew
her
hand
from
christophe
and
went
hurriedly
into
her
house
at
the
door
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
once
more
and
disappeared
christophe
thought
he
should
see
her
again
in
the
evening
but
he
was
watched
by
the
vogels
and
followed
everywhere
by
his
mother
as
usual
he
was
behindhand
with
his
preparations
for
his
journey
and
could
not
find
time
to
leave
the
house
for
a
moment
next
day
he
left
very
early
as
he
passed
sabine
door
he
longed
to
go
in
to
tap
at
the
window
it
hurt
him
to
leave
her
without
saying
for
he
had
been
interrupted
by
rosa
before
he
had
had
time
to
do
so
but
he
thought
she
must
be
asleep
and
would
be
cross
with
him
if
he
woke
her
up
and
then
what
could
he
say
to
her
it
was
too
late
now
to
abandon
his
journey
and
what
if
she
were
to
ask
him
to
do
so
he
did
not
admit
to
himself
that
he
was
not
averse
to
exercising
his
power
over
her
if
need
be
causing
her
a
little
pain
he
did
not
take
seriously
the
grief
that
his
departure
brought
sabine
and
he
thought
that
his
short
absence
would
increase
the
tenderness
which
perhaps
she
had
for
him
he
ran
to
the
station
in
spite
of
everything
he
was
a
little
remorseful
but
as
soon
as
the
train
had
started
it
was
all
forgotten
there
was
youth
in
his
heart
gaily
he
saluted
the
old
town
with
its
roofs
and
towers
rosy
under
the
sun
and
with
the
carelessness
of
those
who
are
departing
he
said
to
those
whom
he
was
leaving
and
thought
no
more
of
them
the
whole
time
that
he
was
at
düsseldorf
and
cologne
sabine
never
once
recurred
to
his
mind
taken
up
from
morning
till
night
with
rehearsals
and
concerts
dinners
and
talk
busied
with
a
thousand
and
one
new
things
and
the
pride
and
satisfaction
of
his
success
he
had
no
time
for
recollection
once
only
on
the
fifth
night
after
he
left
home
he
woke
suddenly
after
a
dream
and
knew
that
he
had
been
thinking
of
in
his
sleep
and
that
the
thought
of
had
wakened
him
up
but
he
could
not
remember
how
he
had
been
thinking
of
her
he
was
unhappy
and
feverish
it
was
not
surprising
he
had
been
playing
at
a
concert
that
evening
and
when
he
left
the
hall
he
had
been
dragged
off
to
a
supper
at
which
he
had
drunk
several
glasses
of
champagne
he
could
not
sleep
and
got
up
he
was
obsessed
by
a
musical
idea
he
pretended
that
it
was
that
which
had
broken
in
upon
his
sleep
and
he
wrote
it
down
as
he
read
through
it
he
was
astonished
to
see
how
sad
it
was
there
was
no
sadness
in
him
when
he
wrote
at
least
so
he
thought
but
he
remembered
that
on
other
occasions
when
he
had
been
sad
he
had
only
been
able
to
write
joyous
music
so
gay
that
it
offended
his
mood
he
gave
no
more
thought
to
it
he
was
used
to
the
surprises
of
his
mind
world
without
ever
being
able
to
understand
them
he
went
to
sleep
at
once
and
knew
no
more
until
the
next
morning
he
extended
his
stay
by
three
or
four
days
it
pleased
him
to
prolong
it
knowing
he
could
return
whenever
he
liked
he
was
in
no
hurry
to
go
home
it
was
only
when
he
was
on
the
way
in
the
train
that
the
thought
of
sabine
came
back
to
him
he
had
not
written
to
her
he
was
even
careless
enough
never
to
have
taken
the
trouble
to
ask
at
the
for
any
letters
that
might
have
been
written
to
him
he
took
a
secret
delight
in
his
silence
he
knew
that
at
home
he
was
expected
that
he
was
loved
loved
she
had
never
told
him
so
he
had
never
told
her
so
no
doubt
they
knew
it
and
had
no
need
to
tell
it
and
yet
there
was
nothing
so
precious
as
the
certainty
of
such
an
avowal
why
had
they
waited
so
long
to
make
it
when
they
had
been
on
the
point
of
speaking
always
something
some
mischance
shyness
embarrassment
had
hindered
them
why
why
how
much
time
they
had
lost
he
longed
to
hear
the
dear
words
from
the
lips
of
the
beloved
he
longed
to
say
them
to
her
he
said
them
aloud
in
the
empty
carriage
as
he
neared
the
town
he
was
torn
with
impatience
a
sort
of
agony
faster
faster
oh
to
think
that
in
an
hour
he
would
see
her
again
it
was
six
in
the
morning
when
he
reached
home
nobody
was
up
yet
sabine
windows
were
closed
he
went
into
the
yard
on
tiptoe
so
that
she
should
not
hear
him
he
chuckled
at
the
thought
of
taking
her
by
surprise
he
went
up
to
his
room
his
mother
was
asleep
he
washed
and
brushed
his
hair
without
making
any
noise
he
was
hungry
but
he
was
afraid
of
waking
louisa
by
rummaging
in
the
pantry
he
heard
footsteps
in
the
yard
he
opened
his
window
softly
and
saw
rosa
first
up
as
usual
beginning
to
sweep
he
called
her
gently
she
started
in
glad
surprise
when
she
saw
him
then
she
looked
solemn
he
thought
she
was
still
offended
with
him
but
for
the
moment
he
was
in
a
very
good
temper
he
went
down
to
her
rosa
rosa
he
said
gaily
give
me
something
to
eat
or
i
shall
eat
you
i
am
dying
of
hunger
rosa
smiled
and
took
him
to
the
kitchen
on
the
ground
floor
she
poured
him
out
a
bowl
of
milk
and
then
could
not
refrain
from
plying
him
with
a
string
of
questions
about
his
travels
and
his
concerts
but
although
he
was
quite
ready
to
answer
them
in
the
happiness
of
his
return
he
was
almost
glad
to
hear
rosa
chatter
once
more
rosa
stopped
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
her
her
face
fell
her
eyes
turned
away
and
she
became
sorrowful
then
her
chatter
broke
out
again
but
soon
it
seemed
that
she
thought
it
out
of
place
and
once
more
she
stopped
short
and
he
noticed
it
then
and
said
what
is
the
matter
rosa
are
you
cross
with
me
she
shook
her
head
violently
in
denial
and
turning
towards
him
with
her
usual
suddenness
took
his
arm
with
both
hands
oh
christophe
she
said
he
was
alarmed
he
let
his
piece
of
bread
fall
from
his
hands
what
what
is
the
matter
he
stammered
she
said
again
oh
christophe
such
an
awful
thing
has
happened
he
thrust
away
from
the
table
he
stuttered
h
here
she
pointed
to
the
house
on
the
other
side
of
the
yard
he
cried
sabine
she
wept
she
is
dead
christophe
saw
nothing
he
got
up
he
almost
fell
he
clung
to
the
table
upset
the
things
on
it
he
wished
to
cry
out
he
suffered
fearful
agony
he
turned
sick
rosa
hastened
to
his
side
she
was
frightened
she
held
his
head
and
wept
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
he
said
it
is
not
true
he
knew
that
it
was
true
but
he
wanted
to
deny
it
he
wanted
to
pretend
that
it
could
not
be
when
he
saw
rosa
face
wet
with
tears
he
could
doubt
no
more
and
he
sobbed
aloud
rosa
raised
her
head
christophe
she
said
he
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
she
leaned
towards
him
christophe
mamma
is
coming
christophe
got
up
no
no
he
said
she
must
not
see
me
she
took
his
hand
and
led
him
stumbling
and
blinded
by
his
tears
to
a
little
woodshed
which
opened
on
to
the
yard
she
closed
the
door
they
were
in
darkness
he
sat
on
a
block
of
wood
used
for
chopping
sticks
she
sat
on
the
fagots
sounds
from
without
were
deadened
and
distant
there
he
could
weep
without
fear
of
being
heard
he
let
himself
go
and
sobbed
furiously
rosa
had
never
seen
him
weep
she
had
even
thought
that
he
could
not
weep
she
knew
only
her
own
girlish
tears
and
such
despair
in
a
man
filled
her
with
terror
and
pity
she
was
filled
with
a
passionate
love
for
christophe
it
was
an
absolutely
unselfish
love
an
immense
need
of
sacrifice
a
maternal
a
hunger
to
suffer
for
him
to
take
his
sorrow
upon
herself
she
put
her
arm
round
his
shoulders
dear
christophe
she
said
do
not
cry
christophe
turned
from
her
i
wish
to
die
rosa
clasped
her
hands
do
say
that
christophe
i
wish
to
die
i
can
not
can
not
live
now
what
is
the
good
of
living
christophe
dear
christophe
you
are
not
alone
you
are
loved
what
is
that
to
me
i
love
nothing
now
it
is
nothing
to
me
whether
everything
else
live
or
die
i
love
nothing
i
loved
only
her
i
loved
only
her
he
sobbed
louder
than
ever
with
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
rosa
could
find
nothing
to
say
the
egoism
of
christophe
passion
stabbed
her
to
the
heart
now
when
she
thought
herself
most
near
to
him
she
felt
more
isolated
and
more
miserable
than
ever
grief
instead
of
bringing
them
together
thrust
them
only
the
more
widely
apart
she
wept
bitterly
after
some
time
christophe
stopped
weeping
and
asked
how
how
rosa
understood
she
fell
ill
of
influenza
on
the
evening
you
left
and
she
was
taken
suddenly
he
groaned
dear
god
why
did
you
not
write
to
me
she
said
i
did
write
i
did
not
know
your
address
you
did
not
give
us
any
i
went
and
asked
at
the
theater
nobody
knew
it
he
knew
how
timid
she
was
and
how
much
it
must
have
cost
her
he
asked
did
she
did
she
tell
you
to
do
that
she
shook
her
head
no
but
i
thought
he
thanked
her
with
a
look
rosa
heart
melted
my
poor
poor
christophe
she
said
she
flung
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
wept
christophe
felt
the
worth
of
such
pure
tenderness
he
had
so
much
need
of
consolation
he
kissed
her
how
kind
you
are
he
said
you
loved
her
too
she
broke
away
from
him
she
threw
him
a
passionate
look
did
not
reply
and
began
to
weep
again
that
look
was
a
revelation
to
him
it
meant
it
was
not
she
whom
i
loved
christophe
saw
at
last
what
he
had
not
known
what
for
months
he
had
not
wished
to
see
he
saw
that
she
loved
him
she
said
they
are
calling
me
they
heard
amalia
voice
rosa
asked
do
you
want
to
go
back
to
your
room
he
said
no
i
could
not
yet
i
could
not
bear
to
talk
to
my
mother
later
on
she
said
stay
here
i
will
come
back
soon
he
stayed
in
the
dark
woodshed
to
which
only
a
thread
of
light
penetrated
through
a
small
airhole
filled
with
cobwebs
from
the
street
there
came
up
the
cry
of
a
hawker
against
the
wall
a
horse
in
a
stable
next
door
was
snorting
and
kicking
the
revelation
that
had
just
come
to
christophe
gave
him
no
pleasure
but
it
held
his
attention
for
a
moment
it
made
plain
many
things
that
he
had
not
understood
a
multitude
of
little
things
that
he
had
disregarded
occurred
to
him
and
were
explained
he
was
surprised
to
find
himself
thinking
of
it
he
was
ashamed
to
be
turned
aside
even
for
a
moment
from
his
misery
but
that
misery
was
so
frightful
so
irrepressible
that
the
mistrust
of
stronger
than
his
will
than
his
courage
than
his
love
forced
him
to
turn
away
from
it
seized
on
this
new
idea
as
the
suicide
drowning
seizes
in
spite
of
himself
on
the
first
object
which
can
help
him
not
to
save
himself
but
to
keep
himself
for
a
moment
longer
above
the
water
and
it
was
because
he
was
suffering
that
he
was
able
to
feel
what
another
was
suffering
suffering
through
him
he
understood
the
tears
that
he
had
brought
to
her
eyes
he
was
filled
with
pity
for
rosa
he
thought
how
cruel
he
had
been
to
her
how
cruel
he
must
still
be
for
he
did
not
love
her
what
good
was
it
for
her
to
love
him
poor
girl
in
vain
did
he
tell
himself
that
she
was
good
she
had
just
proved
it
what
was
her
goodness
to
him
what
was
her
life
to
him
he
thought
why
is
it
not
she
who
is
dead
and
the
other
who
is
alive
he
thought
she
is
alive
she
loves
me
she
can
tell
me
that
all
my
life
and
the
other
the
woman
i
love
she
is
dead
and
never
told
me
that
she
loved
me
i
never
have
told
her
that
i
loved
her
i
shall
never
hear
her
say
it
she
will
never
know
it
and
suddenly
he
remembered
that
last
evening
he
remembered
that
they
were
just
going
to
talk
when
rosa
came
and
prevented
it
and
he
hated
rosa
the
door
of
the
woodshed
was
opened
rosa
called
christophe
softly
and
groped
towards
him
she
took
his
hand
he
felt
an
aversion
in
her
near
presence
in
vain
did
he
reproach
himself
for
it
it
was
stronger
than
himself
rosa
was
silent
her
great
pity
had
taught
her
silence
christophe
was
grateful
to
her
for
not
breaking
in
upon
his
grief
with
useless
words
and
yet
he
wished
to
know
she
was
the
only
creature
who
could
talk
to
him
of
he
asked
in
a
whisper
when
did
she
he
dared
not
say
die
she
replied
last
saturday
week
dimly
he
remembered
he
said
at
night
rosa
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
and
said
yes
at
night
between
two
and
three
the
sorrowful
melody
came
back
to
him
he
asked
trembling
did
she
suffer
much
no
no
god
be
thanked
dear
christophe
she
hardly
suffered
at
all
she
was
so
weak
she
did
not
struggle
against
it
suddenly
they
saw
that
she
was
lost
and
she
did
she
know
it
i
do
know
i
think
did
she
say
anything
no
nothing
she
was
sorry
for
herself
like
a
child
you
were
there
yes
for
the
first
two
days
i
was
there
alone
before
her
brother
came
he
pressed
her
hand
in
gratitude
thank
you
she
felt
the
blood
rush
to
her
heart
after
a
silence
he
said
he
murmured
the
question
which
was
choking
him
did
she
say
anything
for
me
rosa
shook
her
head
sadly
she
would
have
given
much
to
be
able
to
let
him
have
the
answer
he
expected
she
was
almost
sorry
that
she
could
not
lie
about
it
she
tried
to
console
him
she
was
not
conscious
but
she
did
speak
one
could
not
make
out
what
she
said
it
was
in
a
very
low
voice
where
is
the
child
her
brother
took
her
away
with
him
to
the
country
and
she
is
there
too
she
was
taken
away
last
monday
week
they
began
to
weep
again
frau
vogel
voice
called
rosa
once
more
christophe
left
alone
again
lived
through
those
days
of
death
a
week
already
a
week
ago
o
god
what
had
become
of
her
how
it
had
rained
that
week
and
all
that
time
he
was
laughing
he
was
happy
in
his
pocket
he
felt
a
little
parcel
wrapped
up
in
soft
paper
they
were
silver
buckles
that
he
had
brought
her
for
her
shoes
he
remembered
the
evening
when
he
had
placed
his
hand
on
the
little
stockinged
foot
her
little
feet
where
were
they
now
how
cold
they
must
be
he
thought
the
memory
of
that
warm
contact
was
the
only
one
that
he
had
of
the
beloved
creature
he
had
never
dared
to
touch
her
to
take
her
in
his
arms
to
hold
her
to
his
breast
she
was
gone
forever
and
he
had
never
known
her
he
knew
nothing
of
her
neither
soul
nor
body
he
had
no
memory
of
her
body
of
her
life
of
her
love
her
love
what
proof
had
he
of
that
he
had
not
even
a
letter
a
token
nothing
where
could
he
seek
to
hold
her
in
himself
or
outside
himself
oh
nothing
there
was
nothing
left
him
but
the
love
he
had
for
her
nothing
left
him
but
and
in
spite
of
all
his
desperate
desire
to
snatch
her
from
destruction
his
need
of
denying
death
made
him
cling
to
the
last
piece
of
wreckage
in
an
act
of
blind
faith
son
gia
morto
e
ben
cangi
resto
in
te
vivo
mi
vedi
e
piangi
se
nell
altro
amante
si
i
am
not
dead
i
have
changed
my
dwelling
i
live
still
in
thee
who
art
faithful
to
me
the
soul
of
the
beloved
is
merged
in
the
soul
of
the
lover
he
had
never
read
these
sublime
words
but
they
were
in
him
each
one
of
us
in
turn
climbs
the
calvary
of
the
age
each
one
of
us
finds
anew
the
agony
each
one
of
us
finds
anew
the
desperate
hope
and
folly
of
the
ages
each
one
of
us
follows
in
the
footsteps
of
those
who
were
of
those
before
us
who
struggled
with
death
denied
death
and
are
dead
he
shut
himself
up
in
his
room
his
shutters
were
closed
all
day
so
as
not
to
see
the
windows
of
the
house
opposite
he
avoided
the
vogels
they
were
odious
to
his
sight
he
had
nothing
to
reproach
them
with
they
were
too
honest
and
too
pious
not
to
have
thrust
back
their
feelings
in
the
face
of
death
they
knew
christophe
grief
and
respected
it
whatever
they
might
think
of
it
they
never
uttered
sabine
name
in
his
presence
but
they
had
been
her
enemies
when
she
was
alive
that
was
enough
to
make
him
their
enemy
now
that
she
was
dead
besides
they
had
not
altered
their
noisy
habits
and
in
spite
of
the
sincere
though
passing
pity
that
they
had
felt
it
was
obvious
that
at
bottom
they
were
untouched
by
the
misfortune
it
was
too
natural
perhaps
even
they
were
secretly
relieved
by
it
christophe
imagined
so
at
least
now
that
the
vogels
intentions
with
regard
to
himself
were
made
plain
he
exaggerated
them
in
his
own
mind
in
reality
they
attached
little
importance
to
him
he
set
too
great
store
by
himself
but
he
had
no
doubt
that
the
death
of
sabine
by
removing
the
greatest
obstacle
in
the
way
of
his
landlords
plans
did
seem
to
them
to
leave
the
field
clear
for
rosa
so
he
detested
her
that
they
the
vogels
louisa
and
even
rosa
should
have
tacitly
disposed
of
him
without
consulting
him
was
enough
in
any
case
to
make
him
lose
all
affection
for
the
person
whom
he
was
destined
to
love
he
shied
whenever
he
thought
an
attempt
was
made
upon
his
umbrageous
sense
of
liberty
but
now
it
was
not
only
a
question
of
himself
the
rights
which
these
others
had
assumed
over
him
did
not
only
infringe
upon
his
own
rights
but
upon
those
of
the
dead
woman
to
whom
his
heart
was
given
so
he
defended
them
doggedly
although
no
one
was
for
attacking
them
he
suspected
rosa
goodness
she
suffered
in
seeing
him
suffer
and
would
often
come
and
knock
at
his
door
to
console
him
and
talk
to
him
about
the
other
he
did
not
drive
her
away
he
needed
to
talk
of
sabine
with
some
one
who
had
known
her
he
wanted
to
know
the
smallest
of
what
had
happened
during
her
illness
but
he
was
not
grateful
to
rosa
he
attributed
ulterior
motives
to
her
was
it
not
plain
that
her
family
even
amalia
permitted
these
visits
and
long
colloquies
which
she
would
never
have
allowed
if
they
had
not
fallen
in
with
her
wishes
was
not
rosa
in
league
with
her
family
he
could
not
believe
that
her
pity
was
absolutely
sincere
and
free
of
personal
thoughts
and
no
doubt
it
was
not
rosa
pitied
christophe
with
all
her
heart
she
tried
hard
to
see
sabine
through
christophe
eyes
and
through
him
to
love
her
she
was
angry
with
herself
for
all
the
unkind
feelings
that
she
had
ever
had
towards
her
and
asked
her
pardon
in
her
prayers
at
night
but
could
she
forget
that
she
was
alive
that
she
was
seeing
christophe
every
moment
of
the
day
that
she
loved
him
that
she
was
no
longer
afraid
of
the
other
that
the
other
was
gone
that
her
memory
would
also
fade
away
in
its
turn
that
she
was
left
alone
that
one
day
perhaps
in
the
midst
of
her
sorrow
and
the
sorrow
of
her
friend
more
hers
than
her
own
could
she
repress
a
glad
impulse
an
unreasoning
hope
for
that
too
she
was
angry
with
herself
it
was
only
a
flash
it
was
enough
he
saw
it
he
threw
her
a
glance
which
froze
her
heart
she
read
in
it
hateful
thoughts
he
hated
her
for
being
alive
while
the
other
was
dead
the
miller
brought
his
cart
for
sabine
little
furniture
coming
back
from
a
lesson
christophe
saw
heaped
up
before
the
door
in
the
street
the
bed
the
cupboard
the
mattress
the
linen
all
that
she
had
possessed
all
that
was
left
of
her
it
was
a
dreadful
sight
to
him
he
rushed
past
it
in
the
doorway
he
bumped
into
bertold
who
stopped
him
ah
my
dear
sir
he
said
shaking
his
hand
effusively
ah
who
would
have
thought
it
when
we
were
together
how
happy
we
were
and
yet
it
was
because
of
that
day
because
of
that
cursed
row
on
the
water
that
she
fell
oh
well
it
is
no
use
complaining
she
is
dead
it
will
be
our
turn
next
that
is
life
and
how
are
you
i
very
well
thank
god
he
was
red
in
the
face
sweating
and
smelled
of
wine
the
idea
that
he
was
her
brother
that
he
had
rights
in
her
memory
hurt
christophe
it
offended
him
to
hear
this
man
talking
of
his
beloved
the
miller
on
the
contrary
was
glad
to
find
a
friend
with
whom
he
could
talk
of
sabine
he
did
not
understand
christophe
coldness
he
had
no
idea
of
all
the
sorrow
that
his
presence
the
sudden
calling
to
mind
of
the
day
at
his
farm
the
happy
memories
that
he
recalled
so
blunderingly
the
poor
relics
of
sabine
heaped
upon
the
ground
which
he
kicked
as
he
talked
set
stirring
in
christophe
soul
he
made
some
excuse
for
stopping
bertold
tongue
he
went
up
the
steps
but
the
other
clung
to
him
stopped
him
and
went
on
with
his
harangue
at
last
when
the
miller
took
to
telling
him
of
illness
with
that
strange
pleasure
which
certain
people
and
especially
the
common
people
take
in
talking
of
illness
with
a
plethora
of
painful
details
christophe
could
bear
it
no
longer
he
took
a
tight
hold
of
himself
so
as
not
to
cry
out
in
his
sorrow
he
cut
him
short
pardon
he
said
curtly
and
icily
i
must
leave
you
he
left
him
without
another
word
his
insensibility
revolted
the
miller
he
had
guessed
the
secret
affection
of
his
sister
and
christophe
and
that
christophe
should
now
show
such
indifference
seemed
monstrous
to
him
he
thought
he
had
no
heart
christophe
had
fled
to
his
room
he
was
choking
until
the
removal
was
over
he
never
left
his
room
he
vowed
that
he
would
never
look
out
of
the
window
but
he
could
not
help
doing
so
and
hiding
in
a
corner
behind
the
curtain
he
followed
the
departure
of
the
goods
and
chattels
of
the
beloved
eagerly
and
with
profound
sorrow
when
he
saw
them
disappearing
forever
he
all
but
ran
down
to
the
street
to
cry
no
no
leave
them
to
me
do
not
take
them
from
me
he
longed
to
beg
at
least
for
some
little
thing
only
one
little
thing
so
that
she
should
not
be
altogether
taken
from
him
but
how
could
he
ask
such
a
thing
of
the
miller
it
was
nothing
to
him
she
herself
had
not
known
his
love
how
dared
he
then
reveal
it
to
another
and
besides
if
he
had
tried
to
say
a
word
he
would
have
burst
out
crying
no
no
he
had
to
say
nothing
to
watch
all
go
without
being
able
without
daring
to
save
one
fragment
from
the
wreck
and
when
it
was
all
over
when
the
house
was
empty
when
the
yard
gate
was
closed
after
the
miller
when
the
wheels
of
his
cart
moved
on
shaking
the
windows
when
they
were
out
of
hearing
he
threw
himself
on
the
floor
not
a
tear
left
in
him
not
a
thought
of
suffering
of
struggling
frozen
and
like
one
dead
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
he
did
not
move
another
knock
he
had
forgotten
to
lock
the
door
rosa
came
in
she
cried
out
on
seeing
him
stretched
on
the
floor
and
stopped
in
terror
he
raised
his
head
angrily
what
what
do
you
want
leave
me
she
did
not
go
she
stayed
hesitating
leaning
against
the
floor
and
said
again
christophe
he
got
up
in
silence
he
was
ashamed
of
having
been
seen
so
he
dusted
himself
with
his
hand
and
asked
harshly
well
what
do
you
want
rosa
said
shyly
forgive
me
christophe
i
came
in
i
was
bringing
you
he
saw
that
she
had
something
in
her
hand
see
she
said
holding
it
out
to
him
i
asked
bertold
to
give
me
a
little
token
of
her
i
thought
you
would
like
it
it
was
a
little
silver
mirror
the
pocket
mirror
in
which
she
used
to
look
at
herself
for
hours
not
so
much
from
coquetry
as
from
want
of
occupation
christophe
took
it
took
also
the
hand
which
held
it
oh
rosa
he
said
he
was
filled
with
her
kindness
and
the
knowledge
of
his
own
injustice
on
a
passionate
impulse
he
knelt
to
her
and
kissed
her
hand
forgive
forgive
he
said
rosa
did
not
understand
at
first
then
she
understood
only
too
well
she
blushed
she
trembled
she
began
to
weep
she
understood
that
he
meant
forgive
me
if
i
am
unjust
forgive
me
if
i
do
not
love
you
forgive
me
if
i
can
not
if
i
can
not
love
you
if
i
can
never
love
you
she
did
not
withdraw
her
hand
from
him
she
knew
that
it
was
not
herself
that
he
was
kissing
and
with
his
cheek
against
rosa
hand
he
wept
hot
tears
knowing
that
she
was
reading
through
him
there
was
sorrow
and
bitterness
in
being
unable
to
love
her
and
making
her
suffer
they
stayed
so
both
weeping
in
the
dim
light
of
the
room
at
last
she
withdrew
her
hand
he
went
on
murmuring
forgive
she
laid
her
hand
gently
on
his
hand
he
rose
to
his
feet
they
kissed
in
silence
they
felt
on
their
lips
the
bitter
savor
of
their
tears
we
shall
always
be
friends
he
said
softly
she
bowed
her
head
and
left
him
too
sad
to
speak
they
thought
that
the
world
is
ill
made
the
lover
is
unloved
the
beloved
does
not
love
the
lover
who
is
loved
is
sooner
or
later
torn
from
his
love
there
is
suffering
there
is
the
bringing
of
suffering
and
the
most
wretched
is
not
always
the
one
who
suffers
once
more
christophe
took
to
avoiding
the
house
he
could
not
bear
it
he
could
not
bear
to
see
the
curtainless
windows
the
empty
rooms
a
worse
sorrow
awaited
him
old
euler
lost
no
time
in
reletting
the
ground
floor
one
day
christophe
saw
strange
faces
in
sabine
room
new
lives
blotted
out
the
traces
of
the
life
that
was
gone
it
became
impossible
for
him
to
stay
in
his
rooms
he
passed
whole
days
outside
not
coming
back
until
nightfall
when
it
was
too
dark
to
see
anything
once
more
he
took
to
making
expeditions
in
the
country
irresistibly
he
was
drawn
to
bertold
farm
but
he
never
went
in
dared
not
go
near
it
wandered
about
it
at
a
distance
he
discovered
a
place
on
a
hill
from
which
he
could
see
the
house
the
plain
the
river
it
was
thither
that
his
steps
usually
turned
from
thence
he
could
follow
with
his
eyes
the
meanderings
of
the
water
down
to
the
willow
clump
under
which
he
had
seen
the
shadow
of
death
pass
across
sabine
face
from
thence
he
could
pick
out
the
two
windows
of
the
rooms
in
which
they
had
waited
side
by
side
so
near
so
far
separated
by
a
door
the
door
to
eternity
from
thence
he
could
survey
the
cemetery
he
had
never
been
able
to
bring
himself
to
enter
it
from
childhood
he
had
had
a
horror
of
those
fields
of
decay
and
corruption
and
refused
to
think
of
those
whom
he
loved
in
connection
with
them
but
from
a
distance
and
seen
from
above
the
little
graveyard
never
looked
grim
it
was
calm
it
slept
with
the
sun
sleep
she
loved
to
sleep
nothing
would
disturb
her
there
the
crowing
cocks
answered
each
other
across
the
plains
from
the
homestead
rose
the
roaring
of
the
mill
the
clucking
of
the
poultry
yard
the
cries
of
children
playing
he
could
make
out
sabine
little
girl
he
could
see
her
running
he
could
mark
her
laughter
once
he
lay
in
wait
for
her
near
the
gate
of
the
farmyard
in
a
turn
of
the
sunk
road
made
by
the
walls
he
seized
her
as
she
passed
and
kissed
her
the
child
was
afraid
and
began
to
cry
she
had
almost
forgotten
him
already
he
asked
her
are
you
happy
here
yes
it
is
fun
you
do
want
to
come
back
no
he
let
her
go
the
child
indifference
plunged
him
in
sorrow
poor
sabine
and
yet
it
was
she
something
of
her
so
little
the
child
was
hardly
at
all
like
her
mother
had
lived
in
her
but
was
not
she
in
that
mysterious
passage
through
her
being
the
child
had
hardly
retained
more
than
the
faintest
perfume
of
the
creature
who
was
gone
inflections
of
her
voice
a
pursing
of
the
lips
a
trick
of
bending
the
head
the
rest
of
her
was
another
being
altogether
and
that
being
mingled
with
the
being
of
sabine
was
repulsive
to
christophe
though
he
never
admitted
it
to
himself
it
was
only
in
himself
that
christophe
could
find
the
image
of
sabine
it
followed
him
everywhere
hovering
above
him
but
he
only
felt
himself
really
to
be
with
her
when
he
was
alone
nowhere
was
she
nearer
to
him
than
in
this
refuge
on
the
hill
far
from
strange
eyes
in
the
midst
of
the
country
that
was
so
full
of
the
memory
of
her
he
would
go
miles
to
it
climbing
at
a
run
his
heart
beating
as
though
he
were
going
to
a
meeting
with
her
and
so
it
was
indeed
when
he
reached
it
he
would
lie
on
the
ground
the
same
earth
in
which
body
was
laid
he
would
close
his
eyes
and
would
come
to
him
he
could
not
see
her
face
he
could
not
hear
her
voice
he
had
no
need
she
entered
into
him
held
him
he
possessed
her
utterly
in
this
state
of
passionate
hallucination
he
would
lose
the
power
of
thought
he
would
be
unconscious
of
what
was
happening
he
was
unconscious
of
everything
save
that
he
was
with
her
that
state
of
things
did
not
last
to
tell
the
truth
he
was
only
once
altogether
sincere
from
the
day
following
his
will
had
its
share
in
the
proceedings
and
from
that
time
on
christophe
tried
in
vain
to
bring
it
back
to
life
it
was
only
then
that
he
thought
of
evoking
in
himself
the
face
and
form
of
sabine
until
then
he
had
never
thought
of
it
he
succeeded
spasmodically
and
he
was
fired
by
it
but
it
was
only
at
the
cost
of
hours
of
waiting
and
of
darkness
poor
sabine
he
would
think
they
have
all
forgotten
you
there
is
only
i
who
love
you
who
keep
your
memory
alive
forever
oh
my
treasure
my
precious
i
have
you
i
hold
you
i
will
never
let
you
go
he
spoke
these
words
because
already
she
was
escaping
him
she
was
slipping
from
his
thoughts
like
water
through
his
fingers
he
would
return
again
and
again
faithful
to
the
tryst
he
wished
to
think
of
her
and
he
would
close
his
eyes
but
after
half
an
hour
or
an
hour
or
sometimes
two
hours
he
would
begin
to
see
that
he
had
been
thinking
of
nothing
the
sounds
of
the
valley
the
roar
of
the
wind
the
little
bells
of
the
two
goats
browsing
on
the
hill
the
noise
of
the
wind
in
the
little
slender
trees
under
which
he
lay
were
sucked
up
by
his
thoughts
soft
and
porous
like
a
sponge
he
was
angry
with
his
thoughts
they
tried
to
obey
him
and
to
fix
the
vanished
image
to
which
he
was
striving
to
attach
his
life
but
his
thoughts
fell
back
weary
and
chastened
and
once
more
with
a
sigh
of
comfort
abandoned
themselves
to
the
listless
stream
of
sensations
he
shook
off
his
torpor
he
strode
through
the
country
hither
and
thither
seeking
sabine
he
sought
her
in
the
mirror
that
once
had
held
her
smile
he
sought
her
by
the
river
bank
where
her
hands
had
dipped
in
the
water
but
the
mirror
and
the
water
gave
him
only
the
reflection
of
himself
the
excitement
of
walking
the
fresh
air
the
beating
of
his
own
healthy
blood
awoke
music
in
him
once
more
he
wished
to
find
change
oh
sabine
he
sighed
he
dedicated
his
songs
to
her
he
strove
to
call
her
to
life
in
his
music
his
love
and
his
sorrow
in
vain
love
and
sorrow
came
to
life
surely
but
poor
sabine
had
no
share
in
them
love
and
sorrow
looked
towards
the
future
not
towards
the
past
christophe
was
powerless
against
his
youth
the
sap
of
life
swelled
up
again
in
him
with
new
vigor
his
grief
his
regrets
his
chaste
and
ardent
love
his
baffled
desires
heightened
the
fever
that
was
in
him
in
spite
of
his
sorrow
his
heart
beat
in
lively
sturdy
rhythm
wild
songs
leaped
forth
in
mad
intoxicated
strains
everything
in
him
hymned
life
and
even
sadness
took
on
a
festival
shape
christophe
was
too
frank
to
persist
in
and
he
despised
himself
but
life
swept
him
headlong
and
in
his
sadness
with
death
in
his
heart
and
life
in
all
his
limbs
he
abandoned
himself
to
the
forces
newborn
in
him
to
the
absurd
delicious
joy
of
living
which
grief
pity
despair
the
aching
wound
of
an
irreparable
loss
all
the
torment
of
death
can
only
sharpen
and
kindle
into
being
in
the
strong
as
they
rowel
their
sides
with
furious
spur
and
christophe
knew
that
in
himself
in
the
secret
hidden
depths
of
his
soul
he
had
an
inaccessible
and
inviolable
sanctuary
where
lay
the
shadow
of
sabine
that
the
flood
of
life
could
not
bear
away
each
of
us
bears
in
his
soul
as
it
were
a
little
graveyard
of
those
whom
he
has
loved
they
sleep
there
through
the
years
untroubled
but
a
day
cometh
this
we
know
when
the
graves
shall
reopen
the
dead
issue
from
the
tomb
and
smile
with
their
pale
lips
loving
always
on
the
beloved
and
the
lover
in
whose
breast
their
memory
dwells
like
the
child
sleeping
in
the
womb
iii
ada
after
the
wet
summer
the
autumn
was
radiant
in
the
orchards
the
trees
were
weighed
down
with
fruit
the
red
apples
shone
like
billiard
balls
already
some
of
the
trees
were
taking
on
their
brilliant
garb
of
the
falling
year
flame
color
fruit
color
color
of
ripe
melon
of
oranges
and
lemons
of
good
cooking
and
fried
dishes
misty
lights
glowed
through
the
woods
and
from
the
meadows
there
rose
the
little
pink
flames
of
the
saffron
he
was
going
down
a
hill
it
was
a
sunday
afternoon
he
was
striding
almost
running
gaining
speed
down
the
slope
he
was
singing
a
phrase
the
rhythm
of
which
had
been
obsessing
him
all
through
his
walk
he
was
red
disheveled
he
was
walking
swinging
his
arms
and
rolling
his
eyes
like
a
madman
when
as
he
turned
a
bend
in
the
road
he
came
suddenly
on
a
fair
girl
perched
on
a
wall
tugging
with
all
her
might
at
a
branch
of
a
tree
from
which
she
was
greedily
plucking
and
eating
purple
plums
their
astonishment
was
mutual
she
looked
at
him
stared
with
her
mouth
full
then
she
burst
out
laughing
so
did
he
she
was
good
to
see
with
her
round
face
framed
in
fair
curly
hair
which
was
like
a
sunlit
cloud
about
her
her
full
pink
cheeks
her
wide
blue
eyes
her
rather
large
nose
impertinently
turned
up
her
little
red
mouth
showing
white
teeth
the
canine
little
strong
and
projecting
her
plump
chin
and
her
full
figure
large
and
plump
well
built
solidly
put
together
he
called
out
good
eating
and
was
for
going
on
his
road
but
she
called
to
him
sir
sir
will
you
be
very
nice
help
me
to
get
down
i
ca
he
returned
and
asked
her
how
she
had
climbed
up
with
my
hands
and
feet
it
is
easy
enough
to
get
up
especially
when
there
are
tempting
plums
hanging
above
your
head
yes
but
when
you
have
eaten
your
courage
goes
you
ca
find
the
way
to
get
down
he
looked
at
her
on
her
perch
he
said
you
are
all
right
there
stay
there
quietly
i
come
and
see
you
but
he
did
not
budge
and
stood
beneath
her
she
pretended
to
be
afraid
and
begged
him
with
little
glances
not
to
leave
her
they
stayed
looking
at
each
other
and
laughing
she
showed
him
the
branch
to
which
she
was
clinging
and
asked
would
you
like
some
respect
for
property
had
not
developed
in
christophe
since
the
days
of
his
expeditions
with
otto
he
accepted
without
hesitation
she
amused
herself
with
pelting
him
with
plums
when
he
had
eaten
she
said
now
he
took
a
wicked
pleasure
in
keeping
her
waiting
she
grew
impatient
on
her
wall
at
last
he
said
come
then
and
held
his
hand
up
to
her
but
just
as
she
was
about
to
jump
down
she
thought
a
moment
wait
we
must
make
provision
first
she
gathered
the
finest
plums
within
reach
and
filled
the
front
of
her
blouse
with
them
carefully
do
crush
them
he
felt
almost
inclined
to
do
so
she
lowered
herself
from
the
wall
and
jumped
into
his
arms
although
he
was
sturdy
he
bent
under
her
weight
and
all
but
dragged
her
down
they
were
of
the
same
height
their
faces
came
together
he
kissed
her
lips
moist
and
sweet
with
the
juice
of
the
plums
and
she
returned
his
kiss
without
more
ceremony
where
are
you
going
he
asked
i
do
know
are
you
out
alone
no
i
am
with
friends
but
i
have
lost
them
hi
hi
she
called
suddenly
as
loudly
as
she
could
no
answer
she
did
not
bother
about
it
any
more
they
began
to
walk
at
random
following
their
noses
and
you
where
are
you
going
said
she
i
do
know
either
good
we
go
together
she
took
some
plums
from
her
gaping
blouse
and
began
to
munch
them
you
make
yourself
sick
he
said
not
i
i
been
eating
them
all
day
through
the
gap
in
her
blouse
he
saw
the
white
of
her
chemise
they
are
all
warm
now
she
said
let
me
see
she
held
him
one
and
laughed
he
ate
it
she
watched
him
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
as
she
sucked
at
the
fruit
like
a
child
he
did
not
know
how
the
adventure
would
end
it
is
probable
that
she
at
least
had
some
suspicion
she
waited
hi
hi
voices
in
the
woods
hi
hi
she
answered
ah
there
they
are
she
said
to
christophe
not
a
bad
thing
either
but
on
the
contrary
she
was
thinking
that
it
was
rather
a
pity
but
speech
was
not
given
to
woman
for
her
to
say
what
she
is
thinking
thank
god
for
there
would
be
an
end
of
morality
on
earth
the
voices
came
near
her
friends
were
near
the
road
she
leaped
the
ditch
climbed
the
hedge
and
hid
behind
the
trees
he
watched
her
in
amazement
she
signed
to
him
imperiously
to
come
to
her
he
followed
her
she
plunged
into
the
depths
of
the
wood
hi
hi
she
called
once
more
when
they
had
gone
some
distance
you
see
they
must
look
for
me
she
explained
to
christophe
her
friends
had
stopped
on
the
road
and
were
listening
for
her
voice
to
mark
where
it
came
from
they
answered
her
and
in
their
turn
entered
the
woods
but
she
did
not
wait
for
them
she
turned
about
on
right
and
on
left
they
bawled
loudly
after
her
she
let
them
and
then
went
and
called
in
the
opposite
direction
at
last
they
wearied
of
it
and
making
sure
that
the
best
way
of
making
her
come
was
to
give
up
seeking
her
they
called
and
went
off
singing
she
was
furious
that
they
should
not
have
bothered
about
her
any
more
than
that
she
had
tried
to
be
rid
of
them
but
she
had
not
counted
on
their
going
off
so
easily
christophe
looked
rather
foolish
this
game
of
with
a
girl
whom
he
did
not
know
did
not
exactly
enthrall
him
and
he
had
no
thought
of
taking
advantage
of
their
solitude
nor
did
she
think
of
it
in
her
annoyance
she
forgot
christophe
oh
it
too
much
she
said
thumping
her
hands
together
they
have
left
me
but
said
christophe
you
wanted
them
to
not
at
all
you
ran
away
if
i
ran
away
from
them
that
is
my
affair
not
theirs
they
ought
to
look
for
me
what
if
i
were
lost
already
she
was
beginning
to
be
sorry
for
herself
because
if
what
might
have
happened
if
if
the
opposite
of
what
actually
had
occurred
had
come
about
oh
she
said
i
shake
them
she
turned
back
and
strode
off
as
she
went
she
remembered
christophe
and
looked
at
him
once
but
it
was
too
late
she
began
to
laugh
the
little
demon
which
had
been
in
her
the
moment
before
was
gone
while
she
was
waiting
for
another
to
come
she
saw
christophe
with
the
eyes
of
indifference
and
then
she
was
hungry
her
stomach
was
reminding
her
that
it
was
she
was
in
a
hurry
to
rejoin
her
friends
at
the
inn
she
took
christophe
arm
leaned
on
it
with
all
her
weight
groaned
and
said
that
she
was
exhausted
that
did
not
keep
her
from
dragging
christophe
down
a
slope
running
and
shouting
and
laughing
like
a
mad
thing
they
talked
she
learned
who
he
was
she
did
not
know
his
name
and
seemed
not
to
be
greatly
impressed
by
his
title
of
musician
he
learned
that
she
was
a
from
a
in
the
the
most
fashionable
street
in
the
town
her
name
was
adelheid
to
friends
ada
her
companions
on
the
excursion
were
one
of
her
friends
who
worked
at
the
same
place
as
herself
and
two
nice
young
men
a
clerk
at
weiller
bank
and
a
clerk
from
a
big
they
were
turning
their
sunday
to
account
they
had
decided
to
dine
at
the
brochet
inn
from
which
there
is
a
fine
view
over
the
rhine
and
then
to
return
by
boat
the
others
had
already
established
themselves
at
the
inn
when
they
arrived
ada
made
a
scene
with
her
friends
she
complained
of
their
cowardly
desertion
and
presented
christophe
as
her
savior
they
did
not
listen
to
her
complaints
but
they
knew
christophe
the
by
reputation
the
clerk
from
having
heard
some
of
his
compositions
he
thought
it
a
good
idea
to
hum
an
air
from
one
of
them
immediately
afterwards
and
the
respect
which
they
showed
him
made
an
impression
on
ada
the
more
so
as
myrrha
the
other
young
woman
her
real
name
was
hansi
or
johanna
a
brunette
with
blinking
eyes
bumpy
forehead
hair
screwed
back
chinese
face
a
little
too
animated
but
clever
and
not
without
charm
in
spite
of
her
head
and
her
oily
complexion
at
once
began
to
make
advances
to
their
they
begged
him
to
be
so
good
as
to
honor
their
repast
with
his
presence
never
had
he
been
in
such
high
feather
for
he
was
overwhelmed
with
attentions
and
the
two
women
like
good
friends
as
they
were
tried
each
to
rob
the
other
of
him
both
courted
him
myrrha
with
ceremonious
manners
sly
looks
as
she
rubbed
her
leg
against
his
under
the
table
ada
openly
making
play
with
her
fine
eyes
her
pretty
mouth
and
all
the
seductive
resources
at
her
command
such
coquetry
in
its
almost
coarseness
incommoded
and
distressed
christophe
these
two
bold
young
women
were
a
change
from
the
unkindly
faces
he
was
accustomed
to
at
home
myrrha
interested
him
he
guessed
her
to
be
more
intelligent
than
ada
but
her
obsequious
manners
and
her
ambiguous
smile
were
curiously
attractive
and
repulsive
to
him
at
the
same
time
she
could
do
nothing
against
ada
radiance
of
life
and
pleasure
and
she
was
aware
of
it
when
she
saw
that
she
had
lost
the
bout
she
abandoned
the
effort
turned
in
upon
herself
went
on
smiling
and
patiently
waited
for
her
day
to
come
ada
seeing
herself
mistress
of
the
field
did
not
seek
to
push
forward
the
advantage
she
had
gained
what
she
had
done
had
been
mainly
to
despite
her
friend
she
had
succeeded
she
was
satisfied
but
she
had
been
caught
in
her
own
game
she
felt
as
she
looked
into
christophe
eyes
the
passion
that
she
had
kindled
in
him
and
that
same
passion
began
to
awake
in
her
she
was
silent
she
left
her
vulgar
teasing
they
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
on
their
lips
they
had
the
savor
of
their
kiss
from
time
to
time
by
fits
and
starts
they
joined
vociferously
in
the
jokes
of
the
others
then
they
relapsed
into
silence
stealing
glances
at
each
other
at
last
they
did
not
even
look
at
each
other
as
though
they
were
afraid
of
betraying
themselves
absorbed
in
themselves
they
brooded
over
their
desire
when
the
meal
was
over
they
got
ready
to
go
they
had
to
go
a
mile
and
a
half
through
the
woods
to
reach
the
pier
ada
got
up
first
christophe
followed
her
they
waited
on
the
steps
until
the
others
were
ready
without
speaking
side
by
side
in
the
thick
mist
that
was
hardly
at
all
lit
up
by
the
single
lamp
hanging
by
the
inn
myrrha
was
dawdling
by
the
mirror
ada
took
christophe
hand
and
led
him
along
the
house
towards
the
garden
into
the
darkness
under
a
balcony
from
which
hung
a
curtain
of
vines
they
hid
all
about
them
was
dense
darkness
they
could
not
even
see
each
other
the
wind
stirred
the
tops
of
the
pines
he
felt
ada
warm
fingers
entwined
in
his
and
the
sweet
scent
of
a
heliotrope
flower
that
she
had
at
her
breast
suddenly
she
dragged
him
to
her
christophe
lips
found
ada
hair
wet
with
the
mist
and
kissed
her
eyes
her
eyebrows
her
nose
her
cheeks
the
corners
of
her
mouth
seeking
her
lips
and
finding
them
staying
pressed
to
them
the
others
had
gone
they
called
ada
they
did
not
stir
they
hardly
breathed
pressed
close
to
each
other
lips
and
bodies
they
heard
myrrha
they
have
gone
on
the
footsteps
of
their
companions
died
away
in
the
night
they
held
each
other
closer
in
silence
stifling
on
their
lips
a
passionate
murmuring
in
the
distance
a
village
clock
rang
out
they
broke
apart
they
had
to
run
to
the
pier
without
a
word
they
set
out
arms
and
hands
entwined
keeping
step
a
little
quick
firm
step
like
hers
the
road
was
deserted
no
creature
was
abroad
they
could
not
see
ten
yards
ahead
of
them
they
went
serene
and
sure
into
the
beloved
night
they
never
stumbled
over
the
pebbles
on
the
road
as
they
were
late
they
took
a
short
cut
the
path
led
for
some
way
down
through
vines
and
then
began
to
ascend
and
wind
up
the
side
of
the
hill
through
the
mist
they
could
hear
the
roar
of
the
river
and
the
heavy
paddles
of
the
steamer
approaching
they
left
the
road
and
ran
across
the
fields
at
last
they
found
themselves
on
the
bank
of
the
rhine
but
still
far
from
the
pier
their
serenity
was
not
disturbed
ada
had
forgotten
her
fatigue
of
the
evening
it
seemed
to
them
that
they
could
have
walked
all
night
like
that
on
the
silent
grass
in
the
hovering
mists
that
grew
wetter
and
more
dense
along
the
river
that
was
wrapped
in
a
whiteness
as
of
the
moon
the
steamer
siren
hooted
the
invisible
monster
plunged
heavily
away
and
away
they
said
laughing
we
will
take
the
next
by
the
edge
of
the
river
soft
lapping
waves
broke
at
their
feet
at
the
landing
stage
they
were
told
the
last
boat
has
just
gone
christophe
heart
thumped
ada
hand
grasped
his
arm
more
tightly
but
she
said
there
will
be
another
one
a
few
yards
away
in
a
halo
of
mist
was
the
flickering
light
of
a
lamp
hung
on
a
post
on
a
terrace
by
the
river
a
little
farther
on
were
a
few
lighted
windows
a
little
inn
they
went
into
the
tiny
garden
the
sand
ground
under
their
feet
they
groped
their
way
to
the
steps
when
they
entered
the
lights
were
being
put
out
ada
on
christophe
arm
asked
for
a
room
the
room
to
which
they
were
led
opened
on
to
the
little
garden
christophe
leaned
out
of
the
window
and
saw
the
phosphorescent
flow
of
the
river
and
the
shade
of
the
lamp
on
the
glass
of
which
were
crushed
mosquitoes
with
large
wings
the
door
was
closed
ada
was
standing
by
the
bed
and
smiling
he
dared
not
look
at
her
she
did
not
look
at
him
but
through
her
lashes
she
followed
christophe
every
movement
the
floor
creaked
with
every
step
they
could
hear
the
least
noise
in
the
house
they
sat
on
the
bed
and
embraced
in
silence
the
flickering
light
of
the
garden
is
dead
all
is
dead
night
the
abyss
neither
light
nor
consciousness
being
the
obscure
devouring
forces
of
being
joy
joy
rending
joy
which
sucks
down
the
human
creature
as
the
void
a
stone
the
sprout
of
desire
sucking
up
thought
the
absurd
delicious
law
of
the
blind
intoxicated
worlds
which
roll
at
night
a
night
which
is
many
nights
hours
that
are
centuries
records
which
are
death
dreams
shared
words
spoken
with
eyes
closed
tears
and
laughter
the
happiness
of
loving
in
the
voice
of
sharing
the
nothingness
of
sleep
the
swiftly
passing
images
flouting
in
the
brain
the
hallucinations
of
the
roaring
night
the
rhine
laps
in
a
little
creek
by
the
house
in
the
distance
his
waters
over
the
dams
and
breakwaters
make
a
sound
as
of
a
gentle
rain
falling
on
sand
the
hull
of
the
boat
cracks
and
groans
under
the
weight
of
water
the
chain
by
which
it
is
tied
sags
and
grows
taut
with
a
rusty
clattering
the
voice
of
the
river
rises
it
fills
the
room
the
bed
is
like
a
boat
they
are
swept
along
side
by
side
by
a
giddy
current
hung
in
like
a
soaring
bird
the
night
grows
ever
more
dark
the
void
more
empty
ada
weeps
christophe
loses
consciousness
both
are
swept
down
under
the
flowing
waters
of
the
night
night
death
why
wake
to
life
again
the
light
of
the
dawning
day
peeps
through
the
dripping
panes
the
spark
of
life
glows
once
more
in
their
languorous
bodies
he
awakes
ada
eyes
are
looking
at
him
a
whole
life
passes
in
a
few
moments
days
of
sin
greatness
and
peace
where
am
i
and
am
i
two
do
i
still
exist
i
am
no
longer
conscious
of
being
all
about
me
is
the
infinite
i
have
the
soul
of
a
statue
with
large
tranquil
eyes
filled
with
olympian
peace
they
fall
back
into
the
world
of
sleep
and
the
familiar
sounds
of
the
dawn
the
distant
bells
a
passing
boat
oars
dripping
water
footsteps
on
the
road
all
caress
without
disturbing
their
happy
sleep
reminding
them
that
they
are
alive
and
making
them
delight
in
the
savor
of
their
happiness
the
puffing
of
the
steamer
outside
the
window
brought
christophe
from
his
torpor
they
had
agreed
to
leave
at
seven
so
as
to
return
to
the
town
in
time
for
their
usual
occupations
he
whispered
do
you
hear
she
did
not
open
her
eyes
she
smiled
she
put
out
her
lips
she
tried
to
kiss
him
and
then
let
her
head
fall
back
on
his
shoulder
through
the
window
panes
he
saw
the
funnel
of
the
steamer
slip
by
against
the
sky
he
saw
the
empty
deck
and
clouds
of
smoke
once
more
he
slipped
into
dreaminess
an
hour
passed
without
his
knowing
it
he
heard
it
strike
and
started
in
astonishment
ada
he
whispered
to
the
girl
ada
he
said
again
it
eight
her
eyes
were
still
closed
she
frowned
and
pouted
pettishly
oh
let
me
sleep
she
said
she
sighed
wearily
and
turned
her
back
on
him
and
went
to
sleep
once
more
he
began
to
dream
his
blood
ran
bravely
calmly
through
him
his
limpid
senses
received
the
smallest
impressions
simply
and
freshly
he
rejoiced
in
his
strength
and
youth
unwittingly
he
was
proud
of
being
a
man
he
smiled
in
his
happiness
and
felt
himself
alone
alone
as
he
had
always
been
more
lonely
even
but
without
sadness
in
a
divine
solitude
no
more
fever
no
more
shadows
nature
could
freely
cast
her
reflection
upon
his
soul
in
its
serenity
lying
on
his
back
facing
the
window
his
eyes
gazing
deep
into
the
dazzling
air
with
its
luminous
mists
he
smiled
how
good
it
is
to
live
to
live
a
boat
passed
the
thought
suddenly
of
those
who
were
no
longer
alive
of
a
boat
gone
by
on
which
they
were
together
he
she
she
not
that
one
sleeping
by
his
she
the
only
she
the
beloved
the
poor
little
woman
who
was
but
is
it
that
one
how
came
she
there
how
did
they
come
to
this
room
he
looks
at
her
he
does
not
know
her
she
is
a
stranger
to
him
yesterday
morning
she
did
not
exist
for
him
what
does
he
know
of
her
he
knows
that
she
is
not
clever
he
knows
that
she
is
not
good
he
knows
that
she
is
not
even
beautiful
with
her
face
spiritless
and
bloated
with
sleep
her
low
forehead
her
mouth
open
in
breathing
her
swollen
dried
lips
pouting
like
a
fish
he
knows
that
he
does
not
love
her
and
he
is
filled
with
a
bitter
sorrow
when
he
thinks
that
he
kissed
those
strange
lips
in
the
first
moment
with
her
that
he
has
taken
this
beautiful
body
for
which
he
cares
nothing
on
the
first
night
of
their
meeting
and
that
she
whom
he
loved
he
watched
her
live
and
die
by
his
side
and
never
dared
touch
her
hair
with
his
lips
that
he
will
never
know
the
perfume
of
her
being
nothing
more
all
is
crumbled
away
the
earth
has
taken
all
from
him
and
he
never
defended
what
was
his
and
while
he
leaned
over
the
innocent
sleeper
and
scanned
her
face
and
looked
at
her
with
eyes
of
unkindness
she
felt
his
eyes
upon
her
uneasy
under
his
scrutiny
she
made
a
great
effort
to
raise
her
heavy
lids
and
to
smile
and
she
said
stammering
a
little
like
a
waking
child
do
look
at
me
i
ugly
she
fell
back
at
once
weighed
down
with
sleep
smiled
once
more
murmured
oh
i
so
so
sleepy
and
went
off
again
into
her
dreams
he
could
not
help
laughing
he
kissed
her
childish
lips
more
tenderly
he
watched
the
girl
sleeping
for
a
moment
longer
and
got
up
quietly
she
gave
a
comfortable
sigh
when
he
was
gone
he
tried
not
to
wake
her
as
he
dressed
though
there
was
no
danger
of
that
and
when
he
had
done
he
sat
in
the
chair
near
the
window
and
watched
the
steaming
smoking
river
which
looked
as
though
it
were
covered
with
ice
and
he
fell
into
a
brown
study
in
which
there
hovered
music
pastoral
melancholy
from
time
to
time
she
half
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
at
him
vaguely
took
a
second
or
two
smiled
at
him
and
passed
from
one
sleep
to
another
she
asked
him
the
time
a
quarter
to
nine
half
asleep
she
pondered
what
can
it
be
a
quarter
to
nine
at
nine
she
stretched
sighed
and
said
that
she
was
going
to
get
up
it
was
ten
before
she
stirred
she
was
petulant
striking
again
the
clock
is
fast
he
laughed
and
went
and
sat
on
the
bed
by
her
side
she
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
told
him
her
dreams
he
did
not
listen
very
attentively
and
interrupted
her
with
little
love
words
but
she
made
him
be
silent
and
went
on
very
seriously
as
though
she
were
telling
something
of
the
highest
importance
she
was
at
dinner
the
grand
duke
was
there
myrrha
was
a
newfoundland
dog
no
a
frizzy
sheep
who
waited
at
table
ada
had
discovered
a
method
of
rising
from
the
earth
of
walking
dancing
and
lying
down
in
the
air
you
see
it
was
quite
simple
you
had
only
to
do
thus
thus
and
it
was
done
christophe
laughed
at
her
she
laughed
too
though
a
little
ruffled
at
his
laughing
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
ah
you
do
understand
they
breakfasted
on
the
bed
from
the
same
cup
with
the
same
spoon
at
last
she
got
up
she
threw
off
the
bedclothes
and
slipped
down
from
the
bed
then
she
sat
down
to
recover
her
breath
and
looked
at
her
feet
finally
she
clapped
her
hands
and
told
him
to
go
out
and
as
he
was
in
no
hurry
about
it
she
took
him
by
the
shoulders
and
thrust
him
out
of
the
door
and
then
locked
it
after
she
had
dawdled
looked
over
and
stretched
each
of
her
handsome
limbs
she
sang
as
she
washed
a
sentimental
in
fourteen
couplets
threw
water
at
christophe
face
he
was
outside
drumming
on
the
window
and
as
they
left
she
plucked
the
last
rose
in
the
garden
and
then
they
took
the
steamer
the
mist
was
not
yet
gone
but
the
sun
shone
through
it
they
floated
through
a
creamy
light
ada
sat
at
the
stern
with
christophe
she
was
sleepy
and
a
little
sulky
she
grumbled
about
the
light
in
her
eyes
and
said
that
she
would
have
a
headache
all
day
and
as
christophe
did
not
take
her
complaints
seriously
enough
she
returned
into
morose
silence
her
eyes
were
hardly
opened
and
in
them
was
the
funny
gravity
of
children
who
have
just
woke
up
but
at
the
next
an
elegant
lady
came
and
sat
not
far
from
her
and
she
grew
lively
at
once
she
talked
eagerly
to
christophe
about
things
sentimental
and
distinguished
she
had
resumed
with
him
the
ceremonious
christophe
was
thinking
about
what
she
could
say
to
her
employer
by
way
of
excuse
for
her
lateness
she
was
hardly
at
all
concerned
about
it
bah
it
not
the
first
time
the
first
time
that
what
that
i
have
been
late
she
said
put
out
by
the
question
he
dared
not
ask
her
what
had
caused
her
lateness
what
will
you
tell
her
that
my
mother
is
ill
dead
how
do
i
know
he
was
hurt
by
her
talking
so
lightly
i
do
want
you
to
lie
she
took
offense
first
of
all
i
never
lie
and
then
i
can
not
very
well
tell
her
he
asked
her
half
in
jest
half
in
earnest
why
not
she
laughed
shrugged
and
said
that
he
was
coarse
and
and
that
she
had
already
asked
him
not
to
use
the
to
her
have
i
the
right
certainly
not
after
what
has
happened
nothing
has
happened
she
looked
at
him
a
little
defiantly
and
laughed
and
although
she
was
joking
he
felt
most
strongly
that
it
would
not
have
cost
her
much
to
say
it
seriously
and
almost
to
believe
it
but
some
pleasant
memory
tickled
her
for
she
burst
out
laughing
and
looked
at
christophe
and
kissed
him
loudly
without
any
concern
for
the
people
about
who
did
not
seem
to
be
in
the
least
surprised
by
it
now
on
all
his
excursions
he
was
accompanied
by
and
clerks
he
did
not
like
their
vulgarity
and
used
to
try
to
lose
them
but
ada
out
of
contrariness
was
no
longer
disposed
for
wandering
in
the
woods
when
it
rained
or
for
some
other
reason
they
did
not
leave
the
town
he
would
take
her
to
the
theater
or
the
museum
or
the
for
she
insisted
on
being
seen
with
him
she
even
wanted
him
to
go
to
church
with
her
but
he
was
so
absurdly
sincere
that
he
would
not
set
foot
inside
a
church
since
he
had
lost
his
belief
on
some
other
excuse
he
had
resigned
his
position
as
organist
and
at
the
same
time
unknown
to
himself
remained
much
too
religious
not
to
think
ada
proposal
sacrilegious
he
used
to
go
to
her
rooms
in
the
evening
myrrha
would
be
there
for
she
lived
in
the
same
house
myrrha
was
not
at
all
resentful
against
him
she
would
hold
out
her
soft
hand
caressingly
and
talk
of
trivial
and
improper
things
and
then
dip
away
discreetly
the
two
women
had
never
seemed
to
be
such
friends
as
since
they
had
had
small
reason
for
being
so
they
were
always
together
ada
had
no
secrets
from
myrrha
she
told
her
everything
myrrha
listened
to
everything
they
seemed
to
be
equally
pleased
with
it
all
christophe
was
ill
at
ease
in
the
company
of
the
two
women
their
friendship
their
strange
conversations
their
freedom
of
manner
the
crude
way
in
which
myrrha
especially
viewed
and
spoke
of
things
not
so
much
in
his
presence
however
as
when
he
was
not
there
but
ada
used
to
repeat
her
sayings
to
him
their
indiscreet
and
impertinent
curiosity
which
was
forever
turned
upon
subjects
that
were
silly
or
basely
sensual
the
whole
equivocal
and
rather
animal
atmosphere
oppressed
him
terribly
though
it
interested
him
for
he
knew
nothing
like
it
he
was
at
sea
in
the
conversations
of
the
two
little
beasts
who
talked
of
dress
and
made
silly
jokes
and
laughed
in
an
inept
way
with
their
eyes
shining
with
delight
when
they
were
off
on
the
track
of
some
spicy
story
he
was
more
at
ease
when
myrrha
left
them
when
the
two
women
were
together
it
was
like
being
in
a
foreign
country
without
knowing
the
language
it
was
impossible
to
make
himself
understood
they
did
not
even
listen
they
poked
fun
at
the
foreigner
when
he
was
alone
with
ada
they
went
on
speaking
different
languages
but
at
least
they
did
make
some
attempt
to
understand
each
other
to
tell
the
truth
the
more
he
understood
her
the
less
he
understood
her
she
was
the
first
woman
he
had
known
for
if
poor
sabine
was
a
woman
he
had
known
he
had
known
nothing
of
her
she
had
always
remained
for
him
a
phantom
of
his
heart
ada
took
upon
herself
to
make
him
make
up
for
lost
time
in
his
turn
he
tried
to
solve
the
riddle
of
woman
an
enigma
which
perhaps
is
no
enigma
except
for
those
who
seek
some
meaning
in
it
ada
was
without
intelligence
that
was
the
least
of
her
faults
christophe
would
have
commended
her
for
it
if
she
had
approved
it
herself
but
although
she
was
occupied
only
with
stupidities
she
claimed
to
have
some
knowledge
of
the
things
of
the
spirit
and
she
judged
everything
with
complete
assurance
she
would
talk
about
music
and
explain
to
christophe
things
which
he
knew
perfectly
and
would
pronounce
absolute
judgment
and
sentence
it
was
useless
to
try
to
convince
her
she
had
pretensions
and
susceptibilities
in
everything
she
gave
herself
airs
she
was
obstinate
vain
she
would
not
she
could
not
understand
anything
why
would
she
not
accept
that
she
could
understand
nothing
he
loved
her
so
much
better
when
she
was
content
with
being
just
what
she
was
simply
with
her
own
qualities
and
failings
instead
of
trying
to
impose
on
others
and
herself
in
fact
she
was
little
concerned
with
thought
she
was
concerned
with
eating
drinking
singing
dancing
crying
laughing
sleeping
she
wanted
to
be
happy
and
that
would
have
been
all
right
if
she
had
succeeded
but
although
she
had
every
gift
for
it
she
was
greedy
lazy
sensual
and
frankly
egoistic
in
a
way
that
revolted
and
amused
christophe
although
she
had
almost
all
the
vices
which
make
life
pleasant
for
their
fortunate
possessor
if
not
for
their
friends
and
even
then
does
not
a
happy
face
at
least
if
it
be
pretty
shed
happiness
on
all
those
who
come
near
it
in
spite
of
so
many
reasons
for
being
satisfied
with
life
and
herself
ada
was
not
even
clever
enough
for
that
the
pretty
robust
girl
fresh
hearty
endowed
with
abundant
spirits
and
fierce
appetites
was
anxious
about
her
health
she
bemoaned
her
weakness
while
she
ate
enough
for
four
she
was
always
sorry
for
herself
she
could
not
drag
herself
along
she
could
not
breathe
she
had
a
headache
her
eyes
ached
her
stomach
ached
her
soul
ached
she
was
afraid
of
everything
and
madly
superstitious
and
saw
omens
everywhere
at
meals
the
crossing
of
knives
and
forks
the
number
of
the
guests
the
upsetting
of
a
then
there
must
be
a
whole
ritual
to
turn
aside
misfortune
out
walking
she
would
count
the
crows
and
never
failed
to
watch
which
side
they
flew
to
she
would
anxiously
watch
the
road
at
her
feet
and
when
a
spider
crossed
her
path
in
the
morning
she
would
cry
out
aloud
then
she
would
wish
to
go
home
and
there
would
be
no
other
means
of
not
interrupting
the
walk
than
to
persuade
her
that
it
was
after
twelve
and
so
the
omen
was
one
of
hope
rather
than
of
evil
she
was
afraid
of
her
dreams
she
would
recount
them
at
length
to
christophe
for
hours
she
would
try
to
recollect
some
detail
that
she
had
forgotten
she
never
spared
him
one
absurdities
piled
one
on
the
other
strange
marriages
deaths
dressmakers
prices
burlesque
and
sometimes
obscene
things
he
had
to
listen
to
her
and
give
her
his
advice
often
she
would
be
for
a
whole
day
under
the
obsession
of
her
inept
fancies
she
would
find
life
she
would
see
things
and
people
rawly
and
overwhelm
christophe
with
her
jeremiads
and
it
seemed
hardly
worth
while
to
have
broken
away
from
the
gloomy
people
with
whom
he
lived
to
find
once
more
the
eternal
enemy
the
trauriger
ungriechischer
but
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
her
sulks
and
grumblings
she
would
become
gay
noisy
exaggerated
there
was
no
more
dealing
with
her
gaiety
than
with
her
moroseness
she
would
burst
out
laughing
for
no
reason
and
seem
as
though
she
were
never
going
to
stop
she
would
rush
across
the
fields
play
mad
tricks
and
childish
pranks
take
a
delight
in
doing
silly
things
in
mixing
with
the
earth
and
dirty
things
and
the
beasts
and
the
spiders
and
worms
in
teasing
them
and
hurting
them
and
making
them
eat
each
other
the
cats
eat
the
birds
the
fowls
the
worms
the
ants
the
spiders
not
from
any
wickedness
or
perhaps
from
an
altogether
unconscious
instinct
for
evil
from
curiosity
or
from
having
nothing
better
to
do
she
seemed
to
be
driven
always
to
say
stupid
things
to
repeat
senseless
words
again
and
again
to
irritate
christophe
to
exasperate
him
set
his
nerves
on
edge
and
make
him
almost
beside
himself
and
her
coquetry
as
soon
as
anybody
no
matter
who
appeared
on
the
road
then
she
would
talk
excitedly
laugh
noisily
make
faces
draw
attention
to
herself
she
would
assume
an
affected
mincing
gait
christophe
would
have
a
horrible
presentiment
that
she
was
going
to
plunge
into
serious
and
indeed
she
would
do
so
she
would
become
sentimental
uncontrolledly
just
as
she
did
everything
she
would
unbosom
herself
in
a
loud
voice
christophe
would
suffer
and
long
to
beat
her
least
of
all
could
he
forgive
her
her
lack
of
sincerity
he
did
not
yet
know
that
sincerity
is
a
gift
as
rare
as
intelligence
or
beauty
and
that
it
can
not
justly
be
expected
of
everybody
he
could
not
bear
a
lie
and
ada
gave
him
lies
in
full
measure
she
was
always
lying
quite
calmly
in
spite
of
evidence
to
the
contrary
she
had
that
astounding
faculty
for
forgetting
what
is
displeasing
to
them
or
even
what
has
been
pleasing
to
them
which
those
women
possess
who
live
from
moment
to
moment
and
in
spite
of
everything
they
loved
each
other
with
all
their
hearts
ada
was
as
sincere
as
christophe
in
her
love
their
love
was
none
the
less
true
for
not
being
based
on
intellectual
sympathy
it
had
nothing
in
common
with
base
passion
it
was
the
beautiful
love
of
youth
it
was
sensual
but
not
vulgar
because
it
was
altogether
youthful
it
was
naïve
almost
chaste
purged
by
the
ingenuous
ardor
of
pleasure
although
ada
was
not
by
a
long
way
so
ignorant
as
christophe
yet
she
had
still
the
divine
privilege
of
youth
of
soul
and
body
that
freshness
of
the
senses
limpid
and
vivid
as
a
running
stream
which
almost
gives
the
illusion
of
purity
and
through
life
is
never
replaced
egoistic
commonplace
insincere
in
her
ordinary
life
love
made
her
simple
true
almost
good
she
understood
in
love
the
joy
that
is
to
be
found
in
christophe
saw
this
with
delight
and
he
would
gladly
have
died
for
her
who
can
tell
all
the
absurd
and
touching
illusions
that
a
loving
heart
brings
to
its
love
and
the
natural
illusion
of
the
lover
was
magnified
an
hundredfold
in
christophe
by
the
power
of
illusion
which
is
born
in
the
artist
smile
held
profound
meanings
for
him
an
affectionate
word
was
the
proof
of
the
goodness
of
her
heart
he
loved
in
her
all
that
is
good
and
beautiful
in
the
universe
he
called
her
his
own
his
soul
his
life
they
wept
together
over
their
love
pleasure
was
not
the
only
bond
between
them
there
was
an
indefinable
poetry
of
memories
and
dreams
their
own
or
those
of
the
men
and
women
who
had
loved
before
them
who
had
been
before
them
in
them
without
a
word
perhaps
without
knowing
it
they
preserved
the
fascination
of
the
first
moments
of
their
meeting
in
the
woods
the
first
days
the
first
nights
together
those
hours
of
sleep
in
each
other
arms
still
unthinking
sinking
down
into
a
flood
of
love
and
silent
joy
swift
fancies
visions
dumb
thoughts
titillating
and
making
them
go
pale
and
their
hearts
sink
under
their
desire
bringing
all
about
them
a
buzzing
as
of
bees
a
fine
light
and
tender
their
hearts
sink
and
beat
no
more
borne
down
in
excess
of
sweetness
silence
languor
and
fever
the
mysterious
weary
smile
of
the
earth
quivering
under
the
first
sunlight
of
spring
so
fresh
a
love
in
two
young
creatures
is
like
an
april
morning
like
april
it
must
pass
youth
of
the
heart
is
like
an
early
feast
of
sunshine
nothing
could
have
brought
christophe
closer
to
ada
in
his
love
than
the
way
in
which
he
was
judged
by
others
the
day
after
their
first
meeting
it
was
known
all
over
the
town
ada
made
no
attempt
to
cover
up
the
adventure
and
rather
plumed
herself
on
her
conquest
christophe
would
have
liked
more
discretion
but
he
felt
that
the
curiosity
of
the
people
was
upon
him
and
as
he
did
not
wish
to
seem
to
fly
from
it
he
threw
in
his
lot
with
ada
the
little
town
buzzed
with
tattle
christophe
colleagues
in
the
orchestra
paid
him
sly
compliments
to
which
he
did
not
reply
because
he
would
not
allow
any
meddling
with
his
affairs
the
respectable
people
of
the
town
judged
his
conduct
very
severely
he
lost
his
music
lessons
with
certain
families
with
others
the
mothers
thought
that
they
must
now
be
present
at
the
daughters
lessons
watching
with
suspicious
eyes
as
though
christophe
were
intending
to
carry
off
the
precious
darlings
the
young
ladies
were
supposed
to
know
nothing
naturally
they
knew
everything
and
while
they
were
cold
towards
christophe
for
his
lack
of
taste
they
were
longing
to
have
further
details
it
was
only
among
the
small
tradespeople
and
the
shop
people
that
christophe
was
popular
but
not
for
long
he
was
just
as
annoyed
by
their
approval
as
by
the
condemnation
of
the
rest
and
being
unable
to
do
anything
against
that
condemnation
he
took
steps
not
to
keep
their
approval
there
was
no
difficulty
about
that
he
was
furious
with
the
general
indiscretion
the
most
indignant
of
all
with
him
were
justus
euler
and
the
vogels
they
took
christophe
misconduct
as
a
personal
outrage
they
had
not
made
any
serious
plans
concerning
him
they
distrusted
especially
frau
vogel
these
artistic
temperaments
but
as
they
were
naturally
discontented
and
always
inclined
to
think
themselves
persecuted
by
fate
they
persuaded
themselves
that
they
had
counted
on
the
marriage
of
christophe
and
rosa
as
soon
as
they
were
quite
certain
that
such
a
marriage
would
never
come
to
pass
they
saw
in
it
the
mark
of
the
usual
ill
luck
logically
if
fate
were
responsible
for
their
miscalculation
christophe
could
not
be
but
the
vogels
logic
was
that
which
gave
them
the
greatest
opportunity
for
finding
reasons
for
being
sorry
for
themselves
so
they
decided
that
if
christophe
had
misconducted
himself
it
was
not
so
much
for
his
own
pleasure
as
to
give
offense
to
them
they
were
scandalized
very
religious
moral
and
oozing
domestic
virtue
they
were
of
those
to
whom
the
sins
of
the
flesh
are
the
most
shameful
the
most
serious
almost
the
only
sins
because
they
are
the
only
dreadful
sins
it
is
obvious
that
respectable
people
are
never
likely
to
be
tempted
to
steal
or
murder
and
so
christophe
seemed
to
them
absolutely
wicked
and
they
changed
their
demeanor
towards
him
they
were
icy
towards
him
and
turned
away
as
they
passed
him
christophe
who
was
in
no
particular
need
of
their
conversation
shrugged
his
shoulders
at
all
the
fuss
he
pretended
not
to
notice
amalia
insolence
who
while
she
affected
contemptuously
to
avoid
him
did
all
that
she
could
to
make
him
fall
in
with
her
so
that
she
might
tell
him
all
that
was
rankling
in
her
christophe
was
only
touched
by
rosa
attitude
the
girl
condemned
him
more
harshly
even
than
his
family
not
that
this
new
love
of
christophe
seemed
to
her
to
destroy
her
last
chances
of
being
loved
by
him
she
knew
that
she
had
no
chance
left
although
perhaps
she
went
on
hoping
she
always
hoped
but
she
had
made
an
idol
of
christophe
and
that
idol
had
crumbled
away
it
was
the
worst
sorrow
for
her
yes
a
sorrow
more
cruel
to
the
innocence
and
honesty
of
her
heart
than
being
disdained
and
forgotten
by
him
brought
up
puritanically
with
a
narrow
code
of
morality
in
which
she
believed
passionately
what
she
had
heard
about
christophe
had
not
only
brought
her
to
despair
but
had
broken
her
heart
she
had
suffered
already
when
he
was
in
love
with
sabine
she
had
begun
then
to
lose
some
of
her
illusions
about
her
hero
that
christophe
could
love
so
commonplace
a
creature
seemed
to
her
inexplicable
and
inglorious
but
at
least
that
love
was
pure
and
sabine
was
not
unworthy
of
it
and
in
the
end
death
had
passed
over
it
and
sanctified
it
but
that
at
once
christophe
should
love
another
woman
and
such
a
woman
was
base
and
odious
she
took
upon
herself
the
defense
of
the
dead
woman
against
him
she
could
not
forgive
him
for
having
forgotten
her
alas
he
was
thinking
of
her
more
than
she
but
she
never
thought
that
in
a
passionate
heart
there
might
be
room
for
two
sentiments
at
once
she
thought
it
impossible
to
be
faithful
to
the
past
without
sacrifice
of
the
present
pure
and
cold
she
had
no
idea
of
life
or
of
christophe
everything
in
her
eyes
was
pure
narrow
submissive
to
duty
like
herself
modest
of
soul
modest
of
herself
she
had
only
one
source
of
pride
purity
she
demanded
it
of
herself
and
of
others
she
could
not
forgive
christophe
for
having
so
lowered
himself
and
she
would
never
forgive
him
christophe
tried
to
talk
to
her
though
not
to
explain
himself
what
could
he
say
to
her
what
could
he
say
to
a
little
puritanical
and
naïve
girl
he
would
have
liked
to
assure
her
that
he
was
her
friend
that
he
wished
for
her
esteem
and
had
still
the
right
to
it
he
wished
to
prevent
her
absurdly
estranging
herself
from
but
rosa
avoided
him
in
stern
silence
he
felt
that
she
despised
him
he
was
both
sorry
and
angry
he
felt
that
he
did
not
deserve
such
contempt
and
yet
in
the
end
he
was
bowled
over
by
it
and
thought
himself
guilty
of
all
the
reproaches
cast
against
him
the
most
bitter
came
from
himself
when
he
thought
of
sabine
he
tormented
himself
oh
god
how
is
it
possible
what
sort
of
creature
am
i
but
he
could
not
resist
the
stream
that
bore
him
on
he
thought
that
life
is
criminal
and
he
closed
his
eyes
so
as
to
live
without
seeing
it
he
had
so
great
a
need
to
live
and
be
happy
and
love
and
believe
no
there
was
nothing
despicable
in
his
love
he
knew
that
it
was
impossible
to
be
very
wise
or
intelligent
or
even
very
happy
in
his
love
for
ada
but
what
was
there
in
it
that
could
be
called
vile
suppose
he
forced
the
idea
on
himself
that
ada
were
not
a
woman
of
any
great
moral
worth
how
was
the
love
that
he
had
for
her
the
less
pure
for
that
love
is
in
the
lover
not
in
the
beloved
everything
is
worthy
of
the
lover
everything
is
worthy
of
love
to
the
pure
all
is
pure
all
is
pure
in
the
strong
and
the
healthy
of
mind
love
which
adorns
certain
birds
with
their
loveliest
colors
calls
forth
from
the
souls
that
are
true
all
that
is
most
noble
in
them
the
desire
to
show
to
the
beloved
only
what
is
worthy
makes
the
lover
take
pleasure
only
in
those
thoughts
and
actions
which
are
in
harmony
with
the
beautiful
image
fashioned
by
love
and
the
waters
of
youth
in
which
the
soul
is
bathed
the
blessed
radiance
of
strength
and
joy
are
beautiful
and
making
the
heart
great
that
his
friends
misunderstood
him
filled
him
with
bitterness
but
the
worst
trial
of
all
was
that
his
mother
was
beginning
to
be
unhappy
about
it
the
good
creature
was
far
from
sharing
the
narrow
views
of
the
vogels
she
had
seen
real
sorrows
too
near
ever
to
try
to
invent
others
humble
broken
by
life
having
received
little
joy
from
it
and
having
asked
even
less
resigned
to
everything
that
happened
without
even
trying
to
understand
it
she
was
careful
not
to
judge
or
censure
others
she
thought
she
had
no
right
she
thought
herself
too
stupid
to
pretend
that
they
were
wrong
when
they
did
not
think
as
she
did
it
would
have
seemed
ridiculous
to
try
to
impose
on
others
the
inflexible
rules
of
her
morality
and
belief
besides
that
her
morality
and
her
belief
were
purely
instinctive
pious
and
pure
in
herself
she
closed
her
eyes
to
the
conduct
of
others
with
the
indulgence
of
her
class
for
certain
faults
and
certain
weaknesses
that
had
been
one
of
the
complaints
that
her
jean
michel
had
lodged
against
her
she
did
not
sufficiently
distinguish
between
those
who
were
honorable
and
those
who
were
not
she
was
not
afraid
of
stopping
in
the
street
or
the
to
shake
hands
and
talk
with
young
women
notorious
in
the
neighborhood
whom
a
respectable
woman
ought
to
pretend
to
ignore
she
left
it
to
god
to
distinguish
between
good
and
evil
to
punish
or
to
forgive
from
others
she
asked
only
a
little
of
that
affectionate
sympathy
which
is
so
necessary
to
soften
the
ways
of
life
if
people
were
only
kind
she
asked
no
more
but
since
she
had
lived
with
the
vogels
a
change
had
come
about
in
her
the
disparaging
temper
of
the
family
had
found
her
an
easier
prey
because
she
was
crushed
and
had
no
strength
to
resist
amalia
had
taken
her
in
hand
and
from
morning
to
night
when
they
were
working
together
alone
and
amalia
did
all
the
talking
louisa
broken
and
passive
unconsciously
assumed
the
habit
of
judging
and
criticising
everything
frau
vogel
did
not
fail
to
tell
her
what
she
thought
of
christophe
conduct
louisa
calmness
irritated
her
she
thought
it
indecent
of
louisa
to
be
so
little
concerned
about
what
put
him
beyond
the
pale
she
was
not
satisfied
until
she
had
upset
her
altogether
christophe
saw
it
louisa
dared
not
reproach
him
but
every
day
she
made
little
timid
remarks
uneasy
insistent
and
when
he
lost
patience
and
replied
sharply
she
said
no
more
but
still
he
could
see
the
trouble
in
her
eyes
and
when
he
came
home
sometimes
he
could
see
that
she
had
been
weeping
he
knew
his
mother
too
well
not
to
be
absolutely
certain
that
her
uneasiness
did
not
come
from
and
he
knew
well
whence
it
came
he
determined
to
make
an
end
of
it
one
evening
when
louisa
was
unable
to
hold
back
her
tears
and
had
got
up
from
the
table
in
the
middle
of
supper
without
christophe
being
able
to
discover
what
was
the
matter
he
rushed
downstairs
four
steps
at
a
time
and
knocked
at
the
vogels
door
he
was
boiling
with
rage
he
was
not
only
angry
about
frau
vogel
treatment
of
his
mother
he
had
to
avenge
himself
for
her
having
turned
rosa
against
him
for
her
bickering
against
sabine
for
all
that
he
had
had
to
put
up
with
at
her
hands
for
months
for
months
he
had
borne
his
feelings
against
her
and
now
made
haste
to
let
them
loose
he
burst
in
on
frau
vogel
and
in
a
voice
that
he
tried
to
keep
calm
though
it
was
trembling
with
fury
he
asked
her
what
she
had
told
his
mother
to
bring
her
to
such
a
state
amalia
took
it
very
badly
she
replied
that
she
would
say
what
she
pleased
and
was
responsible
to
no
one
for
her
actions
to
him
least
of
all
and
seizing
the
opportunity
to
deliver
the
speech
which
she
had
prepared
she
added
that
if
louisa
was
unhappy
he
had
to
go
no
further
for
the
cause
of
it
than
his
own
conduct
which
was
a
shame
to
himself
and
a
scandal
to
everybody
else
christophe
was
only
waiting
for
her
onslaught
to
strike
out
he
shouted
angrily
that
his
conduct
was
his
own
affair
that
he
did
not
care
a
rap
whether
it
pleased
frau
vogel
or
not
that
if
she
wished
to
complain
of
it
she
must
do
so
to
him
and
that
she
could
say
to
him
whatever
she
liked
that
rested
with
her
but
he
her
did
she
hear
her
to
say
anything
to
his
mother
it
was
cowardly
and
mean
so
to
attack
a
poor
sick
old
woman
frau
vogel
cried
loudly
never
had
any
one
dared
to
speak
to
her
in
such
a
manner
she
said
that
she
was
not
to
be
lectured
fey
a
rapscallion
and
in
her
own
house
too
and
she
treated
him
with
abuse
the
others
came
running
up
on
the
noise
of
the
quarrel
except
vogel
who
fled
from
anything
that
might
upset
his
health
old
euler
was
called
to
witness
by
the
indignant
amalia
and
sternly
bade
christophe
in
future
to
refrain
from
speaking
to
or
visiting
them
he
said
that
they
did
not
need
him
to
tell
them
what
they
ought
to
do
that
they
did
their
duty
and
would
always
do
it
christophe
declared
that
he
would
go
and
would
never
again
set
foot
in
their
house
however
he
did
not
go
until
he
had
relieved
his
feelings
by
telling
them
what
he
had
still
to
say
about
their
famous
duty
which
had
become
to
him
a
personal
enemy
he
said
that
their
duty
was
the
sort
of
thing
to
make
him
love
vice
it
was
people
like
them
who
discouraged
good
by
insisting
on
making
it
unpleasant
it
was
their
fault
that
so
many
find
delight
by
contrast
among
those
who
are
dishonest
but
amiable
and
it
was
a
profanation
of
the
name
of
duty
to
apply
it
to
everything
to
the
most
stupid
tasks
to
trivial
things
with
a
stiff
and
arrogant
severity
which
ends
by
darkening
and
poisoning
life
duty
he
said
was
exceptional
it
should
be
kept
for
moments
of
real
sacrifice
and
not
used
to
lend
the
lover
of
its
name
to
and
the
desire
to
be
disagreeable
to
others
there
was
no
reason
because
they
were
stupid
enough
or
ungracious
enough
to
be
sad
to
want
everybody
else
to
be
so
too
and
to
impose
on
everybody
their
decrepit
way
of
living
the
first
of
all
virtues
is
joy
virtue
must
be
happy
free
and
unconstrained
he
who
does
good
must
give
pleasure
to
himself
but
this
perpetual
upstart
duty
this
pedagogic
tyranny
this
peevishness
this
futile
discussion
this
acrid
puerile
quibbling
this
ungraciousness
this
charmless
life
without
politeness
without
silence
this
pessimism
which
lets
slip
nothing
that
can
make
existence
poorer
than
it
is
this
vainglorious
unintelligence
which
finds
it
easier
to
despise
others
than
to
understand
them
all
this
morality
without
greatness
without
largeness
without
happiness
without
beauty
all
these
things
are
odious
and
hurtful
they
make
vice
appear
more
human
than
virtue
so
thought
christophe
and
in
his
desire
to
hurt
those
who
had
wounded
him
he
did
not
see
that
he
was
being
as
unjust
as
those
of
whom
he
spoke
no
doubt
these
unfortunate
people
were
almost
as
he
saw
them
but
it
was
not
their
fault
it
was
the
fault
of
their
ungracious
life
which
had
made
their
faces
their
doings
and
their
thoughts
ungracious
they
had
suffered
the
deformation
of
misery
not
that
great
misery
which
swoops
down
and
slays
or
forges
anew
but
the
misery
of
ever
recurring
that
small
misery
which
trickles
down
drop
by
drop
from
the
first
day
to
the
last
sad
indeed
for
beneath
these
rough
exteriors
what
treasures
in
reserve
are
there
of
uprightness
of
kindness
of
silent
heroism
the
whole
strength
of
a
people
all
the
sap
of
the
future
christophe
was
not
wrong
in
thinking
duty
exceptional
but
love
is
so
no
less
everything
is
exceptional
everything
that
is
of
worth
has
no
worse
enemy
not
the
evil
the
vices
are
of
worth
but
the
habitual
the
mortal
enemy
of
the
soul
is
the
daily
wear
and
tear
ada
was
beginning
to
weary
of
it
she
was
not
clever
enough
to
find
new
food
for
her
love
in
an
abundant
nature
like
that
of
christophe
her
senses
and
her
vanity
had
extracted
from
it
all
the
pleasure
they
could
find
in
it
there
was
left
her
only
the
pleasure
of
destroying
it
she
had
that
secret
instinct
common
to
so
many
women
even
good
women
to
so
many
men
even
clever
men
who
are
not
creative
either
of
art
or
of
children
or
of
pure
action
no
matter
what
of
life
and
yet
have
too
much
life
in
apathy
and
resignation
to
bear
with
their
uselessness
they
desire
others
to
be
as
useless
as
themselves
and
do
their
best
to
make
them
so
sometimes
they
do
so
in
spite
of
themselves
and
when
they
become
aware
of
their
criminal
desire
they
hotly
thrust
it
back
but
often
they
hug
it
to
themselves
and
they
set
themselves
according
to
their
strength
some
modestly
in
their
own
intimate
circle
others
largely
with
vast
audiences
to
destroy
everything
that
has
life
everything
that
loves
life
everything
that
deserves
life
the
critic
who
takes
upon
himself
to
diminish
the
stature
of
great
men
and
great
thoughts
and
the
girl
who
amuses
herself
with
dragging
down
her
lovers
are
both
mischievous
beasts
of
the
same
but
the
second
is
the
pleasanter
of
the
two
ada
then
would
have
liked
to
corrupt
christophe
a
little
to
humiliate
him
in
truth
she
was
not
strong
enough
more
intelligence
was
needed
even
in
corruption
she
felt
that
and
it
was
not
the
least
of
her
rankling
feelings
against
christophe
that
her
love
could
do
him
no
harm
she
did
not
admit
the
desire
that
was
in
her
to
do
him
harm
perhaps
she
would
have
done
him
none
if
she
had
been
able
but
it
annoyed
her
that
she
could
not
do
it
it
is
to
fail
in
love
for
a
woman
not
to
leave
her
the
illusion
of
her
power
for
good
or
evil
over
her
lover
to
do
that
must
inevitably
be
to
impel
her
irresistibly
to
the
test
of
it
christophe
paid
no
attention
to
it
when
ada
asked
him
jokingly
would
you
leave
your
music
for
me
although
she
had
no
wish
for
him
to
do
so
he
replied
frankly
no
my
dear
neither
you
nor
anybody
else
can
do
anything
against
that
i
shall
always
make
music
and
you
say
you
love
cried
she
put
out
she
hated
his
music
the
more
so
because
she
did
not
understand
it
and
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
find
a
means
of
coming
to
grips
with
this
invisible
enemy
and
so
to
wound
christophe
in
his
passion
if
she
tried
to
talk
of
it
contemptuously
or
scornfully
to
judge
compositions
he
would
shout
with
laughter
and
in
spite
of
her
exasperation
ada
would
relapse
into
silence
for
she
saw
that
she
was
being
ridiculous
but
if
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
in
that
direction
she
had
discovered
another
weak
spot
in
christophe
one
more
easy
of
access
his
moral
faith
in
spite
of
his
squabble
with
the
vogels
and
in
spite
of
the
intoxication
of
his
adolescence
christophe
had
preserved
an
instinctive
modesty
a
need
of
purity
of
which
he
was
entirely
unconscious
at
first
it
struck
ada
attracted
and
charmed
her
then
made
her
impatient
and
irritable
and
finally
being
the
woman
she
was
she
detested
it
she
did
not
make
a
frontal
attack
she
would
ask
insidiously
do
you
love
me
of
course
how
much
do
you
love
me
as
much
as
it
is
possible
to
love
that
is
not
much
after
all
what
would
you
do
for
me
whatever
you
like
would
you
do
something
dishonest
that
would
be
a
queer
way
of
loving
that
is
not
what
i
asked
would
you
it
is
not
necessary
but
if
i
wished
it
you
would
be
wrong
perhaps
would
you
do
it
he
tried
to
kiss
her
but
she
thrust
him
away
would
you
do
it
yes
or
no
no
my
dear
she
turned
her
back
on
him
and
was
furious
you
do
not
love
me
you
do
not
know
what
love
is
that
is
quite
possible
he
said
he
knew
that
like
anybody
else
he
was
capable
in
a
moment
of
passion
of
committing
some
folly
perhaps
something
dishonest
and
who
knows
even
more
but
he
would
have
thought
shame
of
himself
if
he
had
boasted
of
it
in
cold
blood
and
certainly
it
would
be
dangerous
to
confess
it
to
ada
some
instinct
warmed
him
that
the
beloved
foe
was
lying
in
ambush
and
taking
stock
of
his
smallest
remark
he
would
not
give
her
any
weapon
against
him
she
would
return
to
the
charge
again
and
ask
him
do
you
love
me
because
you
love
me
or
because
i
love
you
because
i
love
you
then
if
i
did
not
love
you
you
would
still
love
me
yes
and
if
i
loved
some
one
else
you
would
still
love
me
ah
i
do
know
about
that
i
do
think
so
in
any
case
you
would
be
the
last
person
to
whom
i
should
say
so
how
would
it
be
changed
many
things
would
be
changed
myself
perhaps
you
certainly
and
if
i
changed
what
would
it
matter
all
the
difference
in
the
world
i
love
you
as
you
are
if
you
become
another
creature
i
ca
promise
to
love
you
you
do
not
love
you
do
not
love
what
is
the
use
of
all
this
quibbling
you
love
or
you
do
not
love
if
you
love
me
you
ought
to
love
me
just
as
i
am
whatever
i
do
always
that
would
be
to
love
you
like
an
animal
i
want
to
be
loved
like
that
then
you
have
made
a
mistake
said
he
jokingly
i
am
not
the
sort
of
man
you
want
i
would
like
to
be
but
i
can
not
and
i
will
not
you
are
very
proud
of
your
intelligence
you
love
your
intelligence
more
than
you
do
me
but
i
love
you
you
wretch
more
than
you
love
yourself
the
more
beautiful
and
the
more
good
you
are
the
more
i
love
you
you
are
a
schoolmaster
she
said
with
asperity
what
would
you
i
love
what
is
beautiful
anything
ugly
disgusts
me
even
in
me
especially
in
you
she
drummed
angrily
with
her
foot
i
will
not
be
judged
then
complain
of
what
i
judge
you
to
be
and
of
what
i
love
in
you
said
he
tenderly
to
appease
her
she
let
him
take
her
in
his
arms
and
deigned
to
smile
and
let
him
kiss
her
but
in
a
moment
when
he
thought
she
had
forgotten
she
asked
uneasily
what
do
you
think
ugly
in
me
he
would
not
tell
her
he
replied
cowardly
i
do
think
anything
ugly
in
you
she
thought
for
a
moment
smiled
and
said
just
a
moment
christli
you
say
that
you
do
not
like
lying
i
despise
it
you
are
right
she
said
i
despise
it
too
i
am
of
a
good
conscience
i
never
lie
he
stared
at
her
she
was
sincere
her
unconsciousness
disarmed
him
then
she
went
on
putting
her
arms
about
his
neck
why
would
you
be
cross
with
me
if
i
loved
some
one
else
and
told
you
so
do
tease
me
i
not
teasing
i
am
not
saying
that
i
do
love
some
one
else
i
am
saying
that
i
do
not
but
if
i
did
love
some
one
later
on
well
do
let
us
think
of
it
but
i
want
to
think
of
it
you
would
not
be
angry
with
me
you
could
not
be
angry
with
me
i
should
not
be
angry
with
you
i
should
leave
you
that
is
all
leave
me
why
if
i
still
loved
you
while
you
loved
some
one
else
of
course
it
happens
sometimes
well
it
will
not
happen
with
us
why
because
as
soon
as
you
love
some
one
else
i
shall
love
you
no
longer
my
dear
never
never
again
but
just
now
you
said
perhaps
ah
you
see
you
do
not
love
me
well
then
all
the
better
for
you
because
because
if
i
loved
you
when
you
loved
some
one
else
it
might
turn
out
badly
for
you
me
and
him
then
now
you
are
mad
then
i
am
condemned
to
stay
with
you
all
my
life
be
calm
you
are
free
you
shall
leave
me
when
you
like
only
it
will
not
be
it
will
be
but
if
i
still
love
you
when
people
love
they
sacrifice
themselves
to
each
other
well
then
sacrifice
yourself
he
could
not
help
laughing
at
her
egoism
and
she
laughed
too
the
sacrifice
of
one
only
he
said
means
the
love
of
one
only
not
at
all
it
means
the
love
of
both
i
shall
not
love
you
much
longer
if
you
do
not
sacrifice
yourself
for
me
and
think
christli
how
much
you
will
love
me
when
you
have
sacrificed
yourself
and
how
happy
you
will
be
they
laughed
and
were
glad
to
have
a
change
from
the
seriousness
of
the
disagreement
he
laughed
and
looked
at
her
at
heart
as
she
said
she
had
no
desire
to
leave
christophe
at
present
if
he
irritated
her
and
often
bored
her
she
knew
the
worth
of
such
devotion
as
his
and
she
loved
no
one
else
she
talked
so
for
fun
partly
because
she
knew
he
disliked
it
partly
because
she
took
pleasure
in
playing
with
equivocal
and
unclean
thoughts
like
a
child
which
delights
to
mess
about
with
dirty
water
he
knew
this
he
did
not
mind
but
he
was
tired
of
these
unwholesome
discussions
of
the
silent
struggle
against
this
uncertain
and
uneasy
creature
whom
he
loved
who
perhaps
loved
him
he
was
tired
from
the
effort
that
he
had
to
make
to
deceive
himself
about
her
sometimes
tired
almost
to
tears
he
would
think
why
why
is
she
like
this
why
are
people
like
this
how
life
is
at
the
same
time
he
would
smile
as
he
saw
her
pretty
face
above
him
her
blue
eyes
her
complexion
her
laughing
chattering
lips
foolish
a
little
half
open
to
reveal
the
brilliance
of
her
tongue
and
her
white
teeth
their
lips
would
almost
touch
and
he
would
look
at
her
as
from
a
distance
a
great
distance
as
from
another
world
he
would
see
her
going
farther
and
farther
from
him
vanishing
in
a
mist
and
then
he
would
lose
sight
of
her
he
could
hear
her
no
more
he
would
fall
into
a
sort
of
smiling
oblivion
in
which
he
thought
of
his
music
his
dreams
a
thousand
things
foreign
to
ada
ah
beautiful
music
so
sad
so
mortally
sad
and
yet
kind
loving
ah
how
good
it
is
it
is
that
it
is
that
nothing
else
is
true
she
would
shake
his
arm
a
voice
would
cry
eh
what
the
matter
with
you
you
are
mad
quite
mad
why
do
you
look
at
me
like
that
why
do
you
answer
once
more
he
would
see
the
eyes
looking
at
him
who
was
it
ah
yes
he
would
sigh
she
would
watch
him
she
would
try
to
discover
what
he
was
thinking
of
she
did
not
understand
but
she
felt
that
it
was
useless
that
she
could
not
keep
hold
of
him
that
there
was
always
a
door
by
which
he
could
escape
she
would
conceal
her
irritation
why
are
you
crying
she
asked
him
once
as
he
returned
from
one
of
his
strange
journeys
into
another
life
he
drew
his
hands
across
his
eyes
he
felt
that
they
were
wet
i
do
not
know
he
said
why
do
you
answer
three
times
you
have
said
the
same
thing
what
do
you
want
he
asked
gently
she
went
back
to
her
absurd
discussions
he
waved
his
hand
wearily
yes
she
said
i
done
only
a
word
more
and
off
she
started
again
christophe
shook
himself
angrily
will
you
keep
your
dirtiness
to
yourself
i
was
only
joking
find
cleaner
subjects
then
tell
me
why
then
tell
me
why
you
do
like
it
why
you
ca
argue
as
to
why
a
smells
it
does
smell
and
that
is
all
i
hold
my
nose
and
go
away
he
went
away
furious
and
he
strode
along
taking
in
great
breaths
of
the
cold
air
but
she
would
begin
again
once
twice
ten
times
she
would
bring
forward
every
possible
subject
that
could
shock
him
and
offend
his
conscience
he
thought
it
was
only
a
morbid
jest
of
a
neurasthenic
girl
amusing
herself
by
annoying
him
he
would
shrug
his
shoulders
or
pretend
not
to
hear
her
he
would
not
take
her
seriously
but
sometimes
he
would
long
to
throw
her
out
of
the
window
for
neurasthenia
and
the
neurasthenics
were
very
little
to
his
taste
but
ten
minutes
away
from
her
were
enough
to
make
him
forget
everything
that
had
annoyed
him
he
would
return
to
ada
with
a
fresh
store
of
hopes
and
new
illusions
he
loved
her
love
is
a
perpetual
act
of
faith
whether
god
exist
or
no
is
a
small
matter
we
believe
because
we
believe
we
love
because
we
love
there
is
no
need
of
reasons
after
christophe
quarrel
with
the
vogels
it
became
impossible
for
them
to
stay
in
the
house
and
louisa
had
to
seek
another
lodging
for
herself
and
her
son
one
day
christophe
younger
brother
ernest
of
whom
they
had
not
heard
for
a
long
time
suddenly
turned
up
he
was
out
of
work
having
been
dismissed
in
turn
from
all
the
situations
he
had
procured
his
purse
was
empty
and
his
health
ruined
and
so
he
had
thought
it
would
be
as
well
to
himself
in
his
mother
house
ernest
was
not
on
bad
terms
with
either
of
his
brothers
they
thought
very
little
of
him
and
he
knew
it
but
he
did
not
bear
any
grudge
against
them
for
he
did
not
care
they
had
no
against
him
it
was
not
worth
the
trouble
everything
they
said
to
him
slipped
off
his
back
without
leaving
a
mark
he
just
smiled
with
his
sly
eyes
tried
to
look
contrite
thought
of
something
else
agreed
thanked
them
and
in
the
end
always
managed
to
extort
money
from
one
or
other
of
them
in
spite
of
himself
christophe
was
fond
of
the
pleasant
mortal
who
like
himself
and
more
than
himself
resembled
their
father
melchior
in
feature
tall
and
strong
like
christophe
he
had
regular
features
a
frank
expression
a
straight
nose
a
laughing
mouth
fine
teeth
and
endearing
manners
when
even
christophe
saw
him
he
was
disarmed
and
could
not
deliver
half
the
reproaches
that
he
had
prepared
in
his
heart
he
had
a
sort
of
motherly
indulgence
for
the
handsome
boy
who
was
of
his
blood
and
physically
at
all
events
did
him
credit
he
did
not
believe
him
to
be
bad
and
ernest
was
not
a
fool
without
culture
he
was
not
without
brains
he
was
even
not
incapable
of
taking
an
interest
in
the
things
of
the
mind
he
enjoyed
listening
to
music
and
without
understanding
his
brother
compositions
he
would
listen
to
them
with
interest
christophe
who
did
not
receive
too
much
sympathy
from
his
family
had
been
glad
to
see
him
at
some
of
his
concerts
but
ernest
chief
talent
was
the
knowledge
that
he
possessed
of
the
character
of
his
two
brothers
and
his
skill
in
making
use
of
his
knowledge
it
was
no
use
christophe
knowing
ernest
egoism
and
indifference
it
was
no
use
his
seeing
that
ernest
never
thought
of
his
mother
or
himself
except
when
he
had
need
of
them
he
was
always
taken
in
by
his
affectionate
ways
and
very
rarely
did
he
refuse
him
anything
he
much
preferred
him
to
his
other
brother
rodolphe
who
was
orderly
and
correct
assiduous
in
his
business
strictly
moral
never
asked
for
money
and
never
gave
any
either
visited
his
mother
regularly
every
sunday
stayed
an
hour
and
only
talked
about
himself
boasting
about
himself
his
firm
and
everything
that
concerned
him
never
asking
about
the
others
and
taking
mo
interest
in
them
and
going
away
when
the
hour
was
up
quite
satisfied
with
having
done
his
duty
christophe
could
not
bear
him
he
always
arranged
to
be
out
when
rodolphe
came
rodolphe
was
jealous
of
him
he
despised
artists
and
christophe
success
really
hurt
him
though
he
did
not
fail
to
turn
his
small
fame
to
account
in
the
commercial
circles
in
which
he
moved
but
he
never
said
a
word
about
it
either
to
his
mother
or
to
christophe
he
pretended
to
ignore
it
on
the
other
hand
he
never
ignored
the
least
of
the
unpleasant
things
that
happened
to
christophe
christophe
despised
such
pettiness
and
pretended
not
to
notice
it
but
it
would
really
have
hurt
him
to
know
though
he
never
thought
about
it
that
much
of
the
unpleasant
information
that
rodolphe
had
about
him
came
from
ernest
the
young
rascal
fed
the
differences
between
christophe
and
rodolphe
no
doubt
he
recognized
christophe
superiority
and
perhaps
even
sympathized
a
little
ironically
with
his
candor
but
he
took
good
care
to
turn
it
to
account
and
while
he
despised
rodolphe
he
exploited
it
shamefully
he
flattered
his
vanity
and
jealousy
accepted
his
rebukes
deferentially
and
kept
him
primed
with
the
scandalous
gossip
of
the
town
especially
with
everything
concerning
christophe
of
which
he
was
always
marvelously
informed
so
he
attained
his
ends
and
rodolphe
in
spite
of
his
avarice
allowed
ernest
to
despoil
him
just
as
christophe
did
so
ernest
made
use
and
a
mock
of
them
both
impartially
and
so
both
of
them
loved
him
in
spite
of
his
tricks
ernest
was
in
a
pitiful
condition
when
he
turned
up
at
his
mother
house
he
had
come
from
munich
where
he
had
found
and
as
usual
almost
immediately
lost
a
situation
he
had
had
to
travel
the
best
part
of
the
way
on
foot
through
storms
of
rain
sleeping
god
knows
where
he
was
covered
with
mud
ragged
looking
like
a
beggar
and
coughing
miserably
louisa
was
upset
and
christophe
ran
to
him
in
alarm
when
they
saw
him
come
in
ernest
whose
tears
flowed
easily
did
not
fail
to
make
use
of
the
effect
he
had
produced
and
there
was
a
general
reconciliation
all
three
wept
in
each
other
arms
christophe
gave
up
his
room
they
warmed
the
bed
and
laid
the
invalid
in
it
who
seemed
to
be
on
the
point
of
death
louisa
and
christophe
sat
by
his
bedside
and
took
it
in
turns
to
watch
by
him
they
called
in
a
doctor
procured
medicines
made
a
good
fire
in
the
room
and
gave
him
special
food
then
they
had
to
clothe
him
from
head
to
foot
linen
shoes
clothes
everything
new
ernest
left
himself
in
their
hands
louisa
and
christophe
sweated
to
squeeze
the
money
from
their
expenditure
they
were
very
straitened
at
the
moment
the
removal
the
new
lodgings
which
were
dearer
though
just
as
uncomfortable
fewer
lessons
for
christophe
and
more
expenses
they
could
just
make
both
ends
meet
they
managed
somehow
no
doubt
christophe
could
have
applied
to
rodolphe
who
was
more
in
a
position
to
help
ernest
but
he
would
not
he
made
it
a
point
of
honor
to
help
his
brother
alone
he
thought
himself
obliged
to
do
so
as
the
eldest
and
because
he
was
christophe
hot
with
shame
he
had
to
accept
to
declare
his
willingness
to
accept
an
offer
which
he
had
indignantly
rejected
a
fortnight
before
a
proposal
from
an
agent
of
an
unknown
wealthy
amateur
who
wanted
to
buy
a
musical
composition
for
publication
under
his
own
name
louisa
took
work
out
mending
linen
they
hid
their
sacrifice
from
each
other
they
lied
about
the
money
they
brought
home
when
ernest
was
convalescent
and
sitting
huddled
up
by
the
fire
he
confessed
one
day
between
his
fits
of
coughing
that
he
had
a
few
they
were
paid
no
one
reproached
him
that
would
not
have
been
kind
to
an
invalid
and
a
prodigal
son
who
had
repented
and
returned
home
for
ernest
seemed
to
have
been
changed
by
adversity
and
sickness
with
tears
in
his
eyes
he
spoke
of
his
past
misdeeds
and
louisa
kissed
him
and
told
him
to
think
no
more
of
them
he
was
fond
he
had
always
been
able
to
get
round
his
mother
by
his
demonstrations
of
affection
christophe
had
once
been
a
little
jealous
of
him
now
he
thought
it
natural
that
the
youngest
and
the
weakest
son
should
be
the
most
loved
in
spite
of
the
small
difference
in
their
ages
he
regarded
him
almost
as
a
son
rather
than
as
a
brother
ernest
showed
great
respect
for
him
sometimes
he
would
allude
to
the
burdens
that
christophe
was
taking
upon
himself
and
to
his
sacrifice
of
money
but
christophe
would
not
let
him
go
on
and
ernest
would
content
himself
with
showing
his
gratitude
in
his
eyes
humbly
and
affectionately
he
would
argue
with
the
advice
that
christophe
gave
him
and
he
would
seem
disposed
to
change
his
way
of
living
and
to
work
seriously
as
soon
as
he
was
well
again
he
recovered
but
had
a
long
convalescence
the
doctor
declared
that
his
health
which
he
had
abused
needed
to
be
fostered
so
he
stayed
on
in
his
mother
house
sharing
christophe
bed
eating
heartily
the
bread
that
his
brother
earned
and
the
little
dainty
dishes
that
louisa
prepared
for
him
he
never
spoke
of
going
louisa
and
christophe
never
mentioned
it
either
they
were
too
happy
to
have
found
again
the
son
and
the
brother
they
loved
little
by
little
in
the
long
evenings
that
he
spent
with
ernest
christophe
began
to
talk
intimately
to
him
he
needed
to
confide
in
somebody
ernest
was
clever
he
had
a
quick
mind
and
understood
or
seemed
to
understand
on
a
hint
only
there
was
pleasure
in
talking
to
him
and
yet
christophe
dared
not
tell
him
about
what
lay
nearest
to
his
heart
his
love
he
was
kept
back
by
a
sort
of
modesty
ernest
who
knew
all
about
it
never
let
it
appear
that
he
knew
one
day
when
ernest
was
quite
well
again
he
went
in
the
sunny
afternoon
and
lounged
along
the
rhine
as
he
passed
a
noisy
inn
a
little
way
out
of
the
town
where
there
were
drinking
and
dancing
on
sundays
he
saw
christophe
sitting
with
ada
and
myrrha
who
were
making
a
great
noise
christophe
saw
him
too
and
blushed
ernest
was
discreet
and
passed
on
without
acknowledging
him
christophe
was
much
embarrassed
by
the
encounter
it
made
him
more
keenly
conscious
of
the
company
in
which
he
was
it
hurt
him
that
his
brother
should
have
seen
him
then
not
only
because
it
made
him
lose
the
right
of
judging
ernest
conduct
but
because
he
had
a
very
lofty
very
naïve
and
rather
archaic
notion
of
his
duties
as
an
elder
brother
which
would
have
seemed
absurd
to
many
people
he
thought
that
in
failing
in
that
duty
as
he
was
doing
he
was
lowered
in
his
own
eyes
in
the
evening
when
they
were
together
in
their
room
he
waited
for
ernest
to
allude
to
what
had
happened
but
ernest
prudently
said
nothing
and
waited
also
then
while
they
were
undressing
christophe
decided
to
speak
about
his
love
he
was
so
ill
at
ease
that
he
dared
not
look
at
ernest
and
in
his
shyness
he
assumed
a
gruff
way
of
speaking
ernest
did
not
help
him
out
he
was
silent
and
did
not
look
at
him
though
he
watched
him
all
the
same
and
he
missed
none
of
the
humor
of
christophe
awkwardness
and
clumsy
words
christophe
hardly
dared
pronounce
ada
name
and
the
portrait
that
he
drew
of
her
would
have
done
just
as
well
for
any
woman
who
was
loved
but
he
spoke
of
his
love
little
by
little
he
was
carried
away
by
the
flood
of
tenderness
that
filled
his
heart
he
said
how
good
it
was
to
love
how
wretched
he
had
been
before
he
had
found
that
light
in
the
darkness
and
that
life
was
nothing
without
a
dear
love
his
brother
listened
gravely
he
replied
tactfully
and
asked
no
questions
but
a
warm
handshake
showed
that
he
was
of
christophe
way
of
thinking
they
exchanged
ideas
concerning
love
and
life
christophe
was
happy
at
being
so
well
understood
they
exchanged
a
brotherly
embrace
before
they
went
to
sleep
christophe
grew
accustomed
to
confiding
his
love
to
ernest
though
always
shyly
and
reservedly
ernest
discretion
reassured
him
he
let
him
know
his
uneasiness
about
ada
but
he
never
blamed
her
he
blamed
himself
and
with
tears
in
his
eyes
he
would
declare
that
he
could
not
live
if
he
were
to
lose
her
he
did
not
forget
to
tell
ada
about
ernest
he
praised
his
wit
and
his
good
looks
ernest
never
approached
christophe
with
a
request
to
be
introduced
to
ada
but
he
would
shut
himself
up
in
his
room
and
sadly
refuse
to
go
out
saying
that
he
did
not
know
anybody
christophe
would
think
ill
of
himself
on
sundays
for
going
on
his
excursions
with
ada
while
his
brother
stayed
at
home
and
yet
he
hated
not
to
be
alone
with
his
beloved
he
accused
himself
of
selfishness
and
proposed
that
ernest
should
come
with
them
the
introduction
took
place
at
ada
door
on
the
landing
ernest
and
ada
bowed
politely
ada
came
out
followed
by
her
inseparable
myrrha
who
when
she
saw
ernest
gave
a
little
cry
of
surprise
ernest
smiled
went
up
to
myrrha
and
kissed
her
she
seemed
to
take
it
as
a
matter
of
course
what
you
know
each
other
asked
christophe
in
astonishment
why
yes
said
myrrha
laughing
since
when
oh
a
long
time
and
you
knew
asked
christophe
turning
to
ada
why
did
you
not
tell
me
do
you
think
i
know
all
myrrha
lovers
said
ada
shrugging
her
shoulders
myrrha
took
up
the
word
and
pretended
in
fun
to
be
angry
christophe
could
not
find
out
any
more
about
it
he
was
depressed
it
seemed
to
him
that
ernest
and
myrrha
and
ada
had
been
lacking
in
honesty
although
indeed
he
could
not
have
brought
any
lie
up
against
them
but
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
myrrha
who
had
no
secrets
from
ada
had
made
a
mystery
of
this
and
that
ernest
and
ada
were
not
already
acquainted
with
each
other
he
watched
them
but
they
only
exchanged
a
few
trivial
words
and
ernest
only
paid
attention
to
myrrha
all
the
rest
of
the
day
ada
only
spoke
to
christophe
and
she
was
much
more
amiable
to
him
than
usual
from
that
time
on
ernest
always
joined
them
christophe
could
have
done
without
him
but
he
dared
not
say
so
he
had
no
other
motive
for
wanting
to
leave
his
brother
out
than
his
shame
in
having
him
for
boon
companion
he
had
no
suspicion
of
him
ernest
gave
him
no
cause
for
it
he
seemed
to
be
in
love
with
myrrha
and
was
always
reserved
and
polite
with
ada
and
even
affected
to
avoid
her
in
a
way
that
was
a
little
out
of
place
it
was
as
though
he
wished
to
show
his
brother
mistress
a
little
of
the
respect
he
showed
to
himself
ada
was
not
surprised
by
it
and
was
none
the
less
careful
they
went
on
long
excursions
together
the
two
brothers
would
walk
on
in
front
ada
and
myrrha
laughing
and
whispering
would
follow
a
few
yards
behind
they
would
stop
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
talk
christophe
and
ernest
would
stop
and
wait
for
them
christophe
would
lose
patience
and
go
on
but
soon
he
would
turn
back
annoyed
and
irritated
by
hearing
ernest
talking
and
laughing
with
the
two
young
women
he
would
want
to
know
what
they
were
saying
but
when
they
came
up
with
him
their
conversation
would
stop
what
are
you
three
always
plotting
together
he
would
ask
they
would
reply
with
some
joke
they
had
a
secret
understanding
like
thieves
at
a
fair
christophe
had
a
sharp
quarrel
with
ada
they
had
been
cross
with
each
other
all
day
strange
to
say
ada
had
not
assumed
her
air
of
offended
dignity
to
which
she
usually
resorted
in
such
cases
so
as
to
avenge
herself
by
making
herself
as
intolerably
tiresome
as
usual
now
she
simply
pretended
to
ignore
christophe
existence
and
she
was
in
excellent
spirits
with
the
other
two
it
was
as
though
in
her
heart
she
was
not
put
out
at
all
by
the
quarrel
christophe
on
the
other
hand
longed
to
make
peace
he
was
more
in
love
than
ever
his
tenderness
was
now
mingled
with
a
feeling
of
gratitude
for
all
the
good
things
love
had
brought
him
and
regret
for
the
hours
he
had
wasted
in
stupid
argument
and
angry
thoughts
and
the
unreasoning
fear
the
mysterious
idea
that
their
love
was
nearing
its
end
sadly
he
looked
at
ada
pretty
face
and
she
pretended
not
to
see
him
while
she
was
laughing
with
the
others
and
the
sight
of
her
woke
in
him
so
many
dear
memories
of
great
love
of
sincere
her
face
had
sometimes
it
had
now
so
much
goodness
in
it
a
smile
so
pure
that
christophe
asked
himself
why
things
were
not
better
between
them
why
they
spoiled
their
happiness
with
their
whimsies
why
she
would
insist
on
forgetting
their
bright
hours
and
denying
and
combating
all
that
was
good
and
honest
in
her
what
strange
satisfaction
she
could
find
in
spoiling
and
smudging
if
only
in
thought
the
purity
of
their
love
he
was
conscious
of
an
immense
need
of
believing
in
the
object
of
his
love
and
he
tried
once
more
to
bring
back
his
illusions
he
accused
himself
of
injustice
he
was
remorseful
for
the
thoughts
that
he
attributed
to
her
and
of
his
lack
of
charity
he
went
to
her
and
tried
to
talk
to
her
she
answered
him
with
a
few
curt
words
she
had
no
desire
for
a
reconciliation
with
him
he
insisted
he
begged
her
to
listen
to
him
for
a
moment
away
from
the
others
she
followed
him
ungraciously
when
they
were
a
few
yards
away
so
that
neither
myrrha
nor
ernest
could
see
them
he
took
her
hands
and
begged
her
pardon
and
knelt
at
her
feet
in
the
dead
leaves
of
the
wood
he
told
her
that
he
could
not
go
on
living
so
at
loggerheads
with
her
that
he
found
no
pleasure
in
the
walk
or
the
fine
day
that
he
could
enjoy
nothing
and
could
not
even
breathe
knowing
that
she
detested
him
he
needed
her
love
yes
he
was
often
unjust
violent
disagreeable
he
begged
her
to
forgive
him
it
was
the
fault
of
his
love
he
could
not
bear
anything
in
her
nothing
that
was
altogether
unworthy
of
her
and
their
memories
of
their
dear
past
he
reminded
her
of
it
all
of
their
first
meeting
their
first
days
together
he
said
that
he
loved
her
just
as
much
that
he
would
always
love
her
that
she
should
not
go
away
from
him
she
was
everything
to
him
ada
listened
to
him
smiling
uneasy
almost
softened
she
looked
at
him
with
kind
eyes
eyes
that
said
that
they
loved
each
other
and
that
she
was
no
longer
angry
they
kissed
and
holding
each
other
close
they
went
into
the
leafless
woods
she
thought
christophe
good
and
gentle
and
was
grateful
to
him
for
his
tender
words
but
she
did
not
relinquish
the
naughty
whims
that
were
in
her
mind
but
she
hesitated
she
did
not
cling
to
them
so
tightly
and
yet
she
did
not
abandon
what
she
had
planned
to
do
why
who
can
say
because
she
had
vowed
what
she
would
do
who
knows
perhaps
she
thought
it
more
entertaining
to
deceive
her
lover
that
day
to
prove
to
him
to
prove
to
herself
her
freedom
she
had
no
thought
of
losing
him
she
did
not
wish
for
that
she
thought
herself
more
sure
of
him
than
ever
they
reached
a
clearing
in
the
forest
there
were
two
paths
christophe
took
one
ernest
declared
that
the
other
led
more
quickly
to
the
top
of
the
hill
whither
they
were
going
ada
agreed
with
him
christophe
who
knew
the
way
having
often
been
there
maintained
that
they
were
wrong
they
did
not
yield
then
they
agreed
to
try
it
and
each
wagered
that
he
would
arrive
first
ada
went
with
ernest
myrrha
accompanied
christophe
she
pretended
that
she
was
sure
that
he
was
right
and
she
added
as
usual
christophe
had
taken
the
game
seriously
and
as
he
never
liked
to
lose
he
walked
quickly
too
quickly
for
myrrha
liking
for
she
was
in
much
less
of
a
hurry
than
he
do
be
in
a
hurry
my
friend
she
said
in
her
quiet
ironic
voice
we
shall
get
there
first
he
was
a
little
sorry
true
he
said
i
am
going
a
little
too
fast
there
is
no
need
he
slackened
his
pace
but
i
know
them
he
went
on
i
am
sure
they
will
run
so
as
to
be
there
before
us
myrrha
burst
out
laughing
oh
no
she
said
oh
no
do
you
worry
about
that
she
hung
on
his
arm
and
pressed
close
to
him
she
was
a
little
shorter
than
christophe
and
as
they
walked
she
raised
her
soft
eyes
to
his
she
was
really
pretty
and
alluring
he
hardly
recognized
her
the
change
was
extraordinary
usually
her
face
was
rather
pale
and
puffy
but
the
smallest
excitement
a
merry
thought
or
the
desire
to
please
was
enough
to
make
her
worn
expression
vanish
and
her
cheeks
go
pink
and
the
little
wrinkles
in
her
eyelids
round
and
below
her
eyes
disappear
and
her
eyes
flash
and
her
whole
face
take
on
a
youth
a
life
a
spiritual
quality
that
never
was
in
ada
christophe
was
surprised
by
this
metamorphosis
and
turned
his
eyes
away
from
hers
he
was
a
little
uneasy
at
being
alone
with
her
she
embarrassed
him
and
prevented
him
from
dreaming
as
he
pleased
he
did
not
listen
to
what
she
said
he
did
not
answer
her
or
if
he
did
it
was
only
at
random
he
was
thinking
he
wished
to
think
only
of
ada
he
thought
of
the
kindness
in
her
eyes
her
smile
her
kiss
and
his
heart
was
filled
with
love
myrrha
wanted
to
make
him
admire
the
beauty
of
the
trees
with
their
little
branches
against
the
clear
sky
yes
it
was
all
beautiful
the
clouds
were
gone
ada
had
returned
to
him
he
had
succeeded
in
breaking
the
ice
that
lay
between
them
they
loved
once
more
near
or
far
they
were
one
he
sighed
with
relief
how
light
the
air
was
ada
had
come
back
to
him
everything
brought
her
to
mind
it
was
a
little
damp
would
she
not
be
cold
the
lovely
trees
were
powdered
with
what
a
pity
she
should
not
see
them
but
he
remembered
the
wager
and
hurried
on
he
was
concerned
only
with
not
losing
the
way
he
shouted
joyfully
as
they
reached
the
goal
we
are
first
he
waved
his
hat
gleefully
myrrha
watched
him
and
smiled
the
place
where
they
stood
was
a
high
steep
rock
in
the
middle
of
the
woods
from
this
flat
summit
with
its
fringe
of
and
little
stunted
oaks
they
could
see
over
the
wooded
slopes
the
tops
of
the
pines
bathed
in
a
purple
mist
and
the
long
ribbon
of
the
rhine
in
the
blue
valley
not
a
bird
called
not
a
voice
not
a
breath
of
air
a
still
calm
winter
day
its
chilliness
faintly
warmed
by
the
pale
beams
of
a
misty
sun
now
and
then
in
the
distance
there
came
the
sharp
whistle
of
a
train
in
the
valley
christophe
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
rock
and
looked
down
at
the
countryside
myrrha
watched
christophe
he
turned
to
her
amiably
well
the
lazy
things
i
told
them
so
well
we
must
wait
for
them
he
lay
stretched
out
in
the
sun
on
the
cracked
earth
yes
let
us
wait
said
myrrha
taking
off
her
hat
in
her
voice
there
was
something
so
quizzical
that
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
her
what
is
it
she
asked
quietly
what
did
you
say
i
said
let
us
wait
it
was
no
use
making
me
run
so
fast
true
they
waited
lying
on
the
rough
ground
myrrha
hummed
a
tune
christophe
took
it
up
for
a
few
phrases
but
he
stopped
every
now
and
then
to
listen
i
think
i
can
hear
them
myrrha
went
on
singing
do
stop
for
a
moment
myrrha
stopped
no
it
is
nothing
she
went
on
with
her
song
christophe
could
not
stay
still
perhaps
they
have
lost
their
way
lost
they
could
not
ernest
knows
all
the
paths
a
fantastic
idea
passed
through
christophe
mind
perhaps
they
arrived
first
and
went
away
before
we
came
myrrha
was
lying
on
her
back
and
looking
at
the
sun
she
was
seized
with
a
wild
burst
of
laughter
in
the
middle
of
her
song
and
all
but
choked
christophe
insisted
he
wanted
to
go
down
to
the
station
saying
that
their
friends
would
be
there
already
myrrha
at
last
made
up
her
mind
to
move
you
would
be
certain
to
lose
them
there
was
never
any
talk
about
the
station
we
were
to
meet
here
he
sat
down
by
her
side
she
was
amused
by
his
eagerness
he
was
conscious
of
the
irony
in
her
gaze
as
she
looked
at
him
he
began
to
be
seriously
troubled
to
be
anxious
about
them
he
did
not
suspect
them
he
got
up
once
more
he
spoke
of
going
down
into
the
woods
again
and
looking
for
them
calling
to
them
myrrha
gave
a
little
chuckle
she
took
from
her
pocket
a
needle
scissors
and
thread
and
she
calmly
undid
and
sewed
in
again
the
feathers
in
her
hat
she
seemed
to
have
established
herself
for
the
day
no
no
silly
she
said
if
they
wanted
to
come
do
you
think
they
would
not
come
of
their
own
accord
there
was
a
catch
at
his
heart
he
turned
towards
her
she
did
not
look
at
him
she
was
busy
with
her
work
he
went
up
to
her
myrrha
he
said
eh
she
replied
without
stopping
he
knelt
now
to
look
more
nearly
at
her
myrrha
he
repeated
well
she
asked
raising
her
eyes
from
her
work
and
looking
at
him
with
a
smile
what
is
it
she
had
a
mocking
expression
as
she
saw
his
downcast
face
myrrha
he
asked
choking
tell
me
what
you
think
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
smiled
and
went
on
working
he
caught
her
hands
and
took
away
the
hat
at
which
she
was
sewing
leave
off
leave
off
and
tell
me
she
looked
squarely
at
him
and
waited
she
saw
that
christophe
lips
were
trembling
you
think
he
said
in
a
low
voice
that
ernest
and
ada
she
smiled
oh
well
he
started
back
angrily
no
no
it
is
impossible
you
do
think
that
no
no
she
put
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
and
rocked
with
laughter
how
dense
you
are
how
dense
my
dear
he
shook
her
violently
do
laugh
why
do
you
laugh
you
would
not
laugh
if
it
were
true
you
love
ernest
she
went
on
laughing
and
drew
him
to
her
and
kissed
him
in
spite
of
himself
he
returned
her
kiss
but
when
he
felt
her
lips
on
his
her
lips
still
warm
with
his
brother
kisses
he
flung
her
away
from
him
and
held
her
face
away
from
his
own
he
asked
you
knew
it
it
was
arranged
between
you
she
said
yes
and
laughed
christophe
did
not
cry
out
he
made
no
movement
of
anger
he
opened
his
mouth
as
though
he
could
not
breathe
he
closed
his
eyes
and
clutched
at
his
breast
with
his
hands
his
heart
was
bursting
then
he
lay
down
on
the
ground
with
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
and
he
was
shaken
by
a
crisis
of
disgust
and
despair
like
a
child
myrrha
who
was
not
very
was
sorry
for
him
involuntarily
she
was
filled
with
motherly
compassion
and
leaned
over
him
and
spoke
affectionately
to
him
and
tried
to
make
him
sniff
at
her
but
he
thrust
her
away
in
horror
and
got
up
so
sharply
that
she
was
afraid
he
had
neither
strength
nor
desire
for
revenge
he
looked
at
her
with
his
face
twisted
with
grief
you
drab
he
said
in
despair
you
do
not
know
the
harm
you
have
done
she
tried
to
hold
him
back
he
fled
through
the
woods
spitting
out
his
disgust
with
such
ignominy
with
such
muddy
hearts
with
such
incestuous
sharing
as
that
to
which
they
had
tried
to
bring
him
he
wept
he
trembled
he
sobbed
with
disgust
he
was
filled
with
horror
of
them
all
of
himself
of
his
body
and
soul
a
storm
of
contempt
broke
loose
in
him
it
had
long
been
brewing
sooner
or
later
there
had
to
come
the
reaction
against
the
base
thoughts
the
degrading
compromises
the
stale
and
pestilential
atmosphere
in
which
he
had
been
living
for
months
but
the
need
of
loving
of
deceiving
himself
about
the
woman
he
loved
had
postponed
the
crisis
as
long
as
possible
suddenly
it
burst
upon
him
and
it
was
better
so
there
was
a
great
gust
of
wind
of
a
biting
purity
an
icy
breeze
which
swept
away
the
miasma
disgust
in
one
swoop
had
killed
his
love
for
ada
if
ada
thought
more
firmly
to
establish
her
domination
over
christophe
by
such
an
act
that
proved
once
more
her
gross
inappreciation
of
her
lover
jealousy
which
binds
souls
that
are
besmirched
could
only
revolt
a
nature
like
christophe
young
proud
and
pure
but
what
he
could
not
forgive
what
he
never
would
forgive
was
that
the
betrayal
was
not
the
outcome
of
passion
in
ada
hardly
even
of
one
of
those
absurd
and
degrading
though
often
irresistible
caprices
to
which
the
reason
of
a
woman
is
sometimes
hard
put
to
it
not
to
surrender
no
he
understood
now
it
was
in
her
a
secret
desire
to
degrade
him
to
humiliate
him
to
punish
him
for
his
moral
resistance
for
his
inimical
faith
to
lower
him
to
the
common
level
to
bring
him
to
her
feet
to
prove
to
herself
her
own
power
for
evil
and
he
asked
himself
with
horror
what
is
this
impulse
towards
dirtiness
which
is
in
the
majority
of
human
beings
this
desire
to
besmirch
the
purity
of
themselves
and
others
these
swinish
souls
who
take
a
delight
in
rolling
in
filth
and
are
happy
when
not
one
inch
of
their
skins
is
left
clean
ada
waited
two
days
for
christophe
to
return
to
her
then
she
began
to
be
anxious
and
sent
him
a
tender
note
in
which
she
made
no
allusion
to
what
had
happened
christophe
did
not
even
reply
he
hated
ada
so
profoundly
that
no
words
could
express
his
hatred
he
had
cut
her
out
of
his
life
she
no
longer
existed
for
him
christophe
was
free
of
ada
but
he
was
not
free
of
himself
in
vain
did
he
try
to
return
into
illusion
and
to
take
up
again
the
calm
and
chaste
strength
of
the
past
we
can
not
return
to
the
past
we
have
to
go
onward
it
is
useless
to
turn
back
save
only
to
see
the
places
by
which
we
have
passed
the
distant
smoke
from
the
roofs
under
which
we
have
slept
dying
away
on
the
horizon
in
the
mists
of
memory
but
nothing
so
distances
us
from
the
soul
that
we
had
as
a
few
months
of
passion
the
road
takes
a
sudden
turn
the
country
is
changed
it
is
as
though
we
were
saying
for
the
last
time
to
all
that
we
are
leaving
behind
christophe
could
not
yield
to
it
he
held
out
his
arms
to
the
past
he
strove
desperately
to
bring
to
life
again
the
soul
that
had
been
his
lonely
and
resigned
but
it
was
gone
passion
itself
is
not
so
dangerous
as
the
ruins
that
it
heaps
up
and
leaves
behind
in
vain
did
christophe
not
love
in
vain
for
a
moment
did
he
despise
love
he
bore
the
marks
of
its
talons
his
whole
being
was
steeped
in
it
there
was
in
his
heart
a
void
which
must
be
filled
with
that
terrible
need
of
tenderness
and
pleasure
which
devours
men
and
women
when
they
have
once
tasted
it
some
other
passion
was
needed
were
it
only
the
contrary
passion
the
passion
of
contempt
of
proud
purity
of
faith
in
they
were
not
enough
they
were
not
enough
to
stay
his
hunger
they
were
only
the
food
of
a
moment
his
life
consisted
of
a
succession
of
violent
reactions
leaps
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
sometimes
he
would
bend
his
passion
to
rules
inhumanly
ascetic
not
eating
drinking
water
wearing
himself
out
with
walking
heavy
tasks
and
so
not
sleeping
denying
himself
every
sort
of
pleasure
sometimes
he
would
persuade
himself
that
strength
is
the
true
morality
for
people
like
himself
and
he
would
plunge
into
the
quest
of
joy
in
either
case
he
was
unhappy
he
could
no
longer
be
alone
he
could
no
longer
not
be
alone
the
only
thing
that
could
have
saved
him
would
have
been
to
find
a
true
friendship
rosa
perhaps
he
could
have
taken
refuge
in
that
but
the
rupture
was
complete
between
the
two
families
they
no
longer
met
only
once
had
christophe
seen
rosa
she
was
just
coming
out
from
mass
he
had
hesitated
to
bow
to
her
and
when
she
saw
him
she
had
made
a
movement
towards
him
but
when
he
had
tried
to
go
to
her
through
the
stream
of
the
devout
walking
down
the
steps
she
had
turned
her
eyes
away
and
when
he
approached
her
she
bowed
coldly
and
passed
on
in
the
girl
heart
he
felt
intense
icy
contempt
and
he
did
not
feel
that
she
still
loved
him
and
would
have
liked
to
tell
him
so
but
she
had
come
to
think
of
her
love
as
a
fault
and
foolishness
she
thought
christophe
bad
and
corrupt
and
further
from
her
than
ever
so
they
were
lost
to
each
other
forever
and
perhaps
it
was
as
well
for
both
of
them
in
spite
of
her
goodness
she
was
not
near
enough
to
life
to
be
able
to
understand
him
in
spite
of
his
need
of
affection
and
respect
he
would
have
stifled
in
a
commonplace
and
confined
existence
without
joy
without
sorrow
without
air
they
would
both
have
suffered
the
unfortunate
occurrence
which
cut
them
apart
was
when
all
was
told
perhaps
fortunate
as
often
happens
as
always
happens
to
those
who
are
strong
and
endure
but
at
the
moment
it
was
a
great
sorrow
and
a
great
misfortune
for
them
especially
for
christophe
such
virtuous
intolerance
such
narrowness
of
soul
which
sometimes
seems
to
deprive
those
who
have
the
most
of
them
of
all
intelligence
and
those
who
are
most
good
of
kindness
irritated
him
hurt
him
and
flung
him
back
in
protest
into
a
freer
life
during
his
loafing
with
ada
in
the
beer
gardens
of
the
neighborhood
he
had
made
acquaintance
with
several
good
fellows
bohemians
whose
carelessness
and
freedom
of
manners
had
not
been
altogether
distasteful
to
him
one
of
them
friedemann
a
musician
like
himself
an
organist
a
man
of
thirty
was
not
without
intelligence
and
was
good
at
his
work
but
he
was
incurably
lazy
and
rather
than
make
the
slightest
effort
to
be
more
than
mediocre
he
would
have
died
of
hunger
though
not
perhaps
of
thirst
he
comforted
himself
in
his
indolence
by
speaking
ill
of
those
who
lived
energetically
god
knows
why
and
his
sallies
rather
heavy
for
the
most
part
generally
made
people
laugh
having
more
liberty
than
his
companions
he
was
not
afraid
though
timidly
and
with
winks
and
nods
and
suggestive
remarks
to
sneer
at
those
who
held
positions
he
was
even
capable
of
not
having
opinions
about
music
and
of
having
a
sly
fling
at
the
forged
reputations
of
the
great
men
of
the
day
he
had
no
mercy
upon
women
either
when
he
was
making
his
jokes
he
loved
to
repeat
the
old
saying
of
some
misogynist
monk
about
them
and
christophe
enjoyed
its
bitterness
just
then
more
than
anybody
femina
mors
animae
in
his
state
of
upheaval
christophe
found
some
distraction
in
talking
to
friedemann
he
judged
him
he
could
not
long
take
pleasure
in
this
vulgar
bantering
wit
his
mockery
and
perpetual
denial
became
irritating
before
long
and
he
felt
the
impotence
of
it
all
but
it
did
soothe
his
exasperation
with
the
stupidity
of
the
philistines
while
he
heartily
despised
his
companion
christophe
could
not
do
without
him
they
were
continually
seen
together
sitting
with
the
unclassed
and
doubtful
people
of
friedemann
acquaintance
who
were
even
more
worthless
than
himself
they
used
to
play
and
harangue
and
drink
the
whole
evening
christophe
would
suddenly
wake
up
in
the
midst
of
the
dreadful
smell
of
food
and
tobacco
he
would
look
at
the
people
about
him
with
strange
eyes
he
would
not
recognize
them
he
would
think
in
agony
where
am
i
who
are
these
people
what
have
i
to
do
with
them
their
remarks
and
their
laughter
would
make
him
sick
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
leave
them
he
was
afraid
of
going
home
and
of
being
left
alone
face
to
face
with
his
soul
his
desires
and
remorse
he
was
going
to
the
dogs
he
knew
it
he
was
doing
it
deliberately
with
cruel
clarity
he
saw
in
friedemann
the
degraded
image
of
what
he
was
of
what
he
would
be
one
day
and
he
was
passing
through
a
phase
of
such
disheartenedness
and
disgust
that
instead
of
being
brought
to
himself
by
such
a
menace
it
actually
brought
him
low
he
would
have
gone
to
the
dogs
if
he
could
fortunately
like
all
creatures
of
his
kind
he
had
a
spring
a
succor
against
destruction
which
others
do
not
possess
his
strength
his
instinct
for
life
his
instinct
against
letting
himself
perish
an
instinct
more
intelligent
than
his
intelligence
and
stronger
than
his
will
and
also
unknown
to
himself
he
had
the
strange
curiosity
of
the
artist
that
passionate
impersonal
quality
which
is
in
every
creature
really
endowed
with
creative
power
in
vain
did
he
love
suffer
give
himself
utterly
to
all
his
passions
he
saw
them
they
were
in
him
but
they
were
not
himself
a
myriad
of
little
souls
moved
obscurely
in
him
towards
a
fixed
point
unknown
yet
certain
just
like
the
planetary
worlds
which
are
drawn
through
space
into
a
mysterious
abyss
that
perpetual
state
of
unconscious
action
and
reaction
was
shown
especially
in
those
giddy
moments
when
sleep
came
over
his
daily
life
and
from
the
depths
of
sleep
and
the
night
rose
the
multiform
face
of
being
with
its
gaze
for
a
year
christophe
had
been
obsessed
with
dreams
in
which
in
a
second
of
time
he
felt
clearly
with
perfect
illusion
that
he
at
one
and
the
same
time
several
different
creatures
often
far
removed
from
each
other
by
countries
worlds
centuries
in
his
waking
state
christophe
was
still
under
his
hallucination
and
uneasiness
though
he
could
not
remember
what
had
caused
it
it
was
like
the
weariness
left
by
some
fixed
idea
that
is
gone
though
traces
of
it
are
left
and
there
is
no
understanding
it
but
while
his
soul
was
so
troublously
struggling
through
the
network
of
the
days
another
soul
eager
and
serene
was
watching
all
his
desperate
efforts
he
did
not
see
it
but
it
cast
over
him
the
reflection
of
its
hidden
light
that
soul
was
joyously
greedy
to
feel
everything
to
suffer
everything
to
observe
and
understand
men
women
the
earth
life
desires
passions
thoughts
even
those
that
were
torturing
even
those
that
were
mediocre
even
those
that
were
vile
and
it
was
enough
to
lend
them
a
little
of
its
light
to
save
christophe
from
destruction
it
made
him
feel
he
did
not
know
how
that
he
was
not
altogether
alone
that
love
of
being
and
of
knowing
everything
that
second
soul
raised
a
rampart
against
his
destroying
passions
but
if
it
was
enough
to
keep
his
head
above
water
it
did
not
allow
him
to
climb
out
of
it
unaided
he
could
not
succeed
in
seeing
clearly
into
himself
and
mastering
himself
and
regaining
possession
of
himself
work
was
impossible
for
him
he
was
passing
through
an
intellectual
crisis
the
most
fruitful
of
his
life
all
his
future
life
was
germinating
in
it
but
that
inner
wealth
for
the
time
being
only
showed
itself
in
extravagance
and
the
immediate
effect
of
such
superabundance
was
not
different
from
that
of
the
flattest
sterility
christophe
was
submerged
by
his
life
all
his
powers
had
shot
up
and
grown
too
fast
all
at
once
suddenly
only
his
will
had
not
grown
with
them
and
it
was
dismayed
by
such
a
throng
of
monsters
his
personality
was
cracking
in
every
part
of
this
earthquake
this
inner
cataclysm
others
saw
nothing
christophe
himself
could
see
only
his
impotence
to
will
to
create
to
be
desires
instincts
thoughts
issued
one
after
another
like
clouds
of
sulphur
from
the
fissures
of
a
volcano
and
he
was
forever
asking
himself
and
now
what
will
come
out
what
will
become
of
me
will
it
always
be
so
or
is
this
the
end
of
all
shall
i
be
nothing
always
and
now
there
sprang
up
in
him
his
hereditary
fires
the
vices
of
those
who
had
gone
before
he
got
drunk
he
would
return
home
smelling
of
wine
laughing
in
a
state
of
collapse
poor
louisa
would
look
at
him
sigh
say
nothing
and
pray
but
one
evening
when
he
was
coming
out
of
an
inn
by
the
gates
of
the
town
he
saw
a
few
yards
in
front
of
him
on
the
road
the
droll
shadow
of
his
uncle
gottfried
with
his
pack
on
his
back
the
little
man
had
not
been
home
for
months
and
his
periods
of
absence
were
growing
longer
and
longer
christophe
hailed
him
gleefully
gottfried
bending
under
his
load
turned
round
he
looked
at
christophe
who
was
making
extravagant
gestures
and
sat
down
on
a
milestone
to
wait
for
him
christophe
came
up
to
him
with
a
beaming
face
skipping
along
and
shook
his
uncle
hand
with
great
demonstrations
of
affection
gottfried
took
a
long
look
at
him
and
then
he
said
melchior
christophe
thought
his
uncle
had
made
a
mistake
and
burst
out
laughing
the
poor
man
is
breaking
up
he
thought
he
is
losing
his
memory
indeed
gottfried
did
look
old
shriveled
shrunken
and
dried
his
breathing
came
short
and
painfully
christophe
went
on
talking
gottfried
took
his
pack
on
his
shoulders
again
and
went
on
in
silence
they
went
home
together
christophe
gesticulating
and
talking
at
the
top
of
his
voice
gottfried
coughing
and
saying
nothing
and
when
christophe
questioned
him
gottfried
still
called
him
melchior
and
then
christophe
asked
him
what
do
you
mean
by
calling
me
melchior
my
name
is
christophe
you
know
have
you
forgotten
my
name
gottfried
did
not
stop
he
raised
his
eyes
toward
christophe
and
looked
at
him
shook
his
head
and
said
coldly
no
you
are
melchior
i
know
you
christophe
stopped
dumfounded
gottfried
trotted
along
christophe
followed
him
without
a
word
he
was
sobered
as
they
passed
the
door
of
a
café
he
went
up
to
the
dark
panes
of
glass
in
which
the
of
the
entrance
and
the
empty
streets
were
reflected
and
he
looked
at
himself
he
recognized
melchior
he
went
home
crushed
he
spent
the
night
a
night
of
anguish
in
examining
himself
in
he
understood
now
yes
he
recognized
the
instincts
and
vices
that
had
come
to
light
in
him
they
horrified
him
he
thought
of
that
dark
watching
by
the
body
of
melchior
of
all
that
he
had
sworn
to
do
and
surveying
his
life
since
then
he
knew
that
he
had
failed
to
keep
his
vows
what
had
he
done
in
the
year
what
had
he
done
for
his
god
for
his
art
for
his
soul
what
had
he
done
for
eternity
there
was
not
a
day
that
had
not
been
wasted
botched
besmirched
not
a
single
piece
of
work
not
a
thought
not
an
effort
of
enduring
quality
a
chaos
of
desires
destructive
of
each
other
wind
dust
nothing
what
did
his
intentions
avail
him
he
had
fulfilled
none
of
them
he
had
done
exactly
the
opposite
of
what
he
had
intended
he
had
become
what
he
had
no
wish
to
be
that
was
the
of
his
life
he
did
not
go
to
bed
about
six
in
the
morning
it
was
still
dark
he
heard
gottfried
getting
ready
to
for
gottfried
had
had
no
intentions
of
staying
on
as
he
was
passing
the
town
he
had
come
as
usual
to
embrace
his
sister
and
nephew
but
he
had
announced
that
he
would
go
on
next
morning
christophe
went
downstairs
gottfried
saw
his
pale
face
and
his
eyes
hollow
with
a
night
of
torment
he
smiled
fondly
at
him
and
asked
him
to
go
a
little
of
the
way
with
him
they
set
out
together
before
dawn
they
had
no
need
to
talk
they
understood
each
other
as
they
passed
the
cemetery
gottfried
said
shall
we
go
in
when
he
came
to
the
place
he
never
failed
to
pay
a
visit
to
jean
michel
and
melchior
christophe
had
not
been
there
for
a
year
gottfried
knelt
by
melchior
grave
and
said
let
us
pray
that
they
may
sleep
well
and
not
come
to
torment
us
his
thought
was
a
mixture
of
strange
superstitions
and
sound
sense
sometimes
it
surprised
christophe
but
now
it
was
only
too
dear
to
him
they
said
no
more
until
they
left
the
cemetery
when
they
had
closed
the
creaking
gate
and
were
walking
along
the
wall
through
the
cold
fields
waking
from
slumber
by
the
little
path
which
led
them
under
the
cypress
trees
from
which
the
snow
was
dropping
christophe
began
to
weep
oh
uncle
he
said
how
wretched
i
am
he
dared
not
speak
of
his
experience
in
love
from
an
odd
fear
of
embarrassing
or
hurting
gottfried
but
he
spoke
of
his
shame
his
mediocrity
his
cowardice
his
broken
vows
what
am
i
to
do
uncle
i
have
tried
i
have
struggled
and
after
a
year
i
am
no
further
on
than
before
worse
i
have
gone
back
i
am
good
for
nothing
i
am
good
for
nothing
i
have
ruined
my
life
i
am
perjured
they
were
walking
up
the
hill
above
the
town
gottfried
said
kindly
not
for
the
last
time
my
boy
we
do
not
do
what
we
will
to
do
we
will
and
we
live
two
things
you
must
be
comforted
the
great
thing
is
you
see
never
to
give
up
willing
and
living
the
rest
does
not
depend
on
us
christophe
repeated
desperately
i
have
perjured
myself
do
you
hear
said
gottfried
the
cocks
were
crowing
in
all
the
countryside
they
too
are
crowing
for
another
who
is
perjured
they
crow
for
every
one
of
us
every
morning
a
day
will
come
said
christophe
bitterly
when
they
will
no
longer
crow
for
me
a
day
to
which
there
is
no
and
what
shall
i
have
made
of
my
life
there
is
always
a
said
gottfried
but
what
can
one
do
if
willing
is
no
use
watch
and
pray
i
do
not
believe
gottfried
smiled
you
would
not
be
alive
if
you
did
not
believe
every
one
believes
pray
pray
to
what
gottfried
pointed
to
the
sun
appearing
on
the
horizon
red
and
frozen
be
reverent
before
the
dawning
day
do
not
think
of
what
will
be
in
a
year
or
in
ten
years
think
of
leave
your
theories
all
theories
you
see
even
those
of
virtue
are
bad
foolish
mischievous
do
not
abuse
life
live
in
be
reverent
towards
each
day
love
it
respect
it
do
not
sully
it
do
not
hinder
it
from
coming
to
flower
love
it
even
when
it
is
gray
and
sad
like
do
not
be
anxious
see
it
is
winter
now
everything
is
asleep
the
good
earth
will
awake
again
you
have
only
to
be
good
and
patient
like
the
earth
be
reverent
wait
if
you
are
good
all
will
go
well
if
you
are
not
if
you
are
weak
if
you
do
not
succeed
well
you
must
be
happy
in
that
no
doubt
it
is
the
best
you
can
do
so
then
why
why
be
angry
because
of
what
you
can
not
do
we
all
have
to
do
what
we
can
ich
it
is
not
enough
said
christophe
making
a
face
gottfried
laughed
pleasantly
it
is
more
than
anybody
does
you
are
a
vain
fellow
you
want
to
be
a
hero
that
is
why
you
do
such
silly
things
a
hero
i
do
quite
know
what
that
is
but
you
see
i
imagine
that
a
hero
is
a
man
who
does
what
he
can
the
others
do
not
do
it
oh
sighed
christophe
then
what
is
the
good
of
living
it
is
not
worth
while
and
yet
there
are
people
who
say
who
wills
can
gottfried
laughed
again
softly
yes
oh
well
they
are
liars
my
friend
or
they
do
not
will
anything
much
they
had
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
they
embraced
affectionately
the
little
peddler
went
on
treading
wearily
christophe
stayed
there
lost
in
thought
and
watched
him
go
he
repeated
his
uncle
saying
ich
the
best
i
can
and
he
smiled
thinking
yes
all
the
same
it
is
enough
he
returned
to
the
town
the
frozen
snow
crackled
under
his
feet
the
bitter
winter
wind
made
the
bare
branches
of
the
stunted
trees
on
the
hill
shiver
it
reddened
his
cheeks
and
made
his
skin
tingle
and
set
his
blood
racing
the
red
roofs
of
the
town
below
were
smiling
under
the
brilliant
cold
sun
the
air
was
strong
and
harsh
the
frozen
earth
seemed
to
rejoice
in
bitter
gladness
and
christophe
heart
was
like
that
he
thought
i
too
shall
wake
again
there
were
still
tears
in
his
eyes
he
dried
them
with
the
back
of
his
hand
and
laughed
to
see
the
sun
dipping
down
behind
a
veil
of
mist
the
clouds
heavy
with
snow
were
floating
over
the
town
lashed
by
the
squall
he
laughed
at
them
the
wind
blew
icily
blow
blow
do
what
you
will
with
me
bear
me
with
you
i
know
now
where
i
am
going
revolt
i
shifting
sands
free
he
felt
that
he
was
free
free
of
others
and
of
himself
the
network
of
passion
in
which
he
had
been
enmeshed
for
more
than
a
year
had
suddenly
been
burst
asunder
how
he
did
not
know
the
filaments
had
given
before
the
growth
of
his
being
it
was
one
of
those
crises
of
growth
in
which
robust
natures
tear
away
the
dead
casing
of
the
year
that
is
past
the
old
soul
in
which
they
are
cramped
and
stifled
christophe
breathed
deeply
without
understanding
what
had
happened
an
icy
whirlwind
was
rushing
through
the
great
gate
of
the
town
as
he
returned
from
taking
gottfried
on
his
way
the
people
were
walking
with
heads
lowered
against
the
storm
girls
going
to
their
work
were
struggling
against
the
wind
that
blew
against
their
skirts
they
stopped
every
now
and
then
to
breathe
with
their
nose
and
cheeks
red
and
they
looked
exasperated
and
as
though
they
wanted
to
cry
he
thought
of
that
other
torment
through
which
he
had
passed
he
looked
at
the
wintry
sky
the
town
covered
with
snow
the
people
struggling
along
past
him
he
looked
about
him
into
himself
he
was
no
longer
bound
he
was
alone
alone
how
happy
to
be
alone
to
be
his
own
what
joy
to
have
escaped
from
his
bonds
from
his
torturing
memories
from
the
hallucinations
of
faces
that
he
loved
or
detested
what
joy
at
last
to
live
without
being
the
prey
of
life
to
have
become
his
own
master
he
went
home
white
with
snow
he
shook
himself
gaily
like
a
dog
as
he
passed
his
mother
who
was
sweeping
the
passage
he
lifted
her
up
giving
little
inarticulate
cries
of
affection
such
as
one
makes
to
a
tiny
child
poor
old
louisa
struggled
in
her
son
arms
she
was
wet
with
the
melting
snow
and
she
called
him
with
a
jolly
laugh
a
great
gaby
he
went
up
to
his
room
three
steps
at
a
he
could
hardly
see
himself
in
his
little
mirror
it
was
so
dark
but
his
heart
was
glad
his
room
was
low
and
narrow
and
it
was
difficult
to
move
in
it
but
it
was
like
a
kingdom
to
him
he
locked
the
door
and
laughed
with
pleasure
at
last
he
was
finding
himself
how
long
he
had
been
gone
astray
he
was
eager
to
plunge
into
thought
like
a
bather
into
water
it
was
like
a
great
lake
afar
off
melting
into
the
mists
of
blue
and
gold
after
a
night
of
fever
and
oppressive
heat
he
stood
by
the
edge
of
it
with
his
legs
bathed
in
the
freshness
of
the
water
his
body
kissed
by
the
wind
of
a
summer
morning
he
plunged
in
and
swam
he
knew
not
whither
he
was
going
and
did
not
care
it
was
joy
to
swim
whithersoever
he
listed
he
was
silent
then
he
laughed
and
listened
for
the
thousand
thousand
sounds
of
his
soul
it
swarmed
with
life
he
could
make
out
nothing
his
head
was
swimming
he
felt
only
a
bewildering
happiness
he
was
glad
to
feel
in
himself
such
unknown
forces
and
indolently
postponing
putting
his
powers
to
the
test
he
sank
back
into
the
intoxication
of
pride
in
the
inward
flowering
which
held
back
for
months
now
burst
forth
like
a
sudden
spring
his
mother
called
him
to
breakfast
he
went
down
he
was
giddy
and
as
though
he
had
spent
a
day
in
the
open
air
but
there
was
such
a
radiance
of
joy
in
him
that
louisa
asked
what
was
the
matter
he
made
no
reply
he
seized
her
by
the
waist
and
forced
her
to
dance
with
him
round
the
table
on
which
the
tureen
was
steaming
out
of
breath
louisa
cried
that
he
was
mad
then
she
clasped
her
hands
dear
god
she
said
anxiously
sure
he
is
in
love
again
christophe
roared
with
laughter
he
hurled
his
napkin
into
the
air
in
love
he
cried
oh
lord
but
no
i
had
enough
you
can
be
easy
on
that
score
that
is
done
done
forever
ouf
he
drank
a
glassful
of
water
louisa
looked
at
him
reassured
wagged
her
head
and
smiled
that
a
drunkard
pledge
she
said
it
wo
last
until
then
the
day
is
clear
gain
he
replied
oh
yes
she
said
but
what
has
made
you
so
happy
i
am
happy
that
is
all
sitting
opposite
her
with
his
elbows
on
the
table
he
tried
to
tell
her
all
that
he
was
going
to
do
she
listened
with
kindly
skepticism
and
gently
pointed
out
that
his
soup
was
going
cold
he
knew
that
she
did
not
hear
what
he
was
saying
but
he
did
not
care
he
was
talking
for
his
own
satisfaction
they
looked
at
each
other
smiling
he
talking
she
hardly
listening
although
she
was
proud
of
her
son
she
attached
no
great
importance
to
his
artistic
projects
she
was
thinking
he
is
happy
that
matters
most
while
he
was
growing
more
and
more
excited
with
his
discourse
he
watched
his
mother
dear
face
with
her
black
shawl
tightly
tied
round
her
head
her
white
hair
her
young
eyes
that
devoured
him
lovingly
her
sweet
and
tranquil
kindliness
he
knew
exactly
what
she
was
thinking
he
said
to
her
jokingly
it
is
all
one
to
you
eh
you
do
care
about
what
i
telling
you
she
protested
weakly
oh
no
oh
no
he
kissed
her
oh
yes
oh
yes
you
need
not
defend
yourself
you
are
right
only
love
me
there
is
no
need
to
understand
me
either
for
you
or
for
anybody
else
i
do
not
need
anybody
or
anything
now
i
have
everything
in
myself
oh
said
louisa
another
maggot
in
his
brain
but
if
he
must
have
one
i
prefer
this
to
the
other
what
sweet
happiness
to
float
on
the
surface
of
the
lake
of
his
thoughts
lying
in
the
bottom
of
a
boat
with
his
body
bathed
in
sun
his
face
kissed
by
the
light
fresh
wind
that
skims
over
the
face
of
the
waters
he
goes
to
sleep
he
is
swung
by
threads
from
the
sky
under
his
body
lying
at
full
length
under
the
rocking
boat
he
feels
the
deep
swelling
water
his
hand
dips
into
it
he
rises
and
with
his
chin
on
the
edge
of
the
boat
he
watches
the
water
flowing
by
as
he
did
when
he
was
a
child
he
sees
the
reflection
of
strange
creatures
darting
by
like
lightning
more
and
yet
more
they
are
never
the
same
he
laughs
at
the
fantastic
spectacle
that
is
unfolded
within
him
he
laughs
at
his
own
thoughts
he
has
no
need
to
catch
and
hold
them
select
why
select
among
so
many
thousands
of
dreams
there
is
plenty
of
time
later
on
he
has
only
to
throw
out
a
line
at
will
to
draw
in
the
monsters
whom
he
sees
gleaming
in
the
water
he
lets
them
pass
later
on
the
boat
floats
on
at
the
whim
of
the
warm
wind
and
the
insentient
stream
all
is
soft
sun
and
silence
at
last
languidly
he
throws
out
his
line
leaning
out
over
the
lapping
water
he
follows
it
with
his
eyes
until
it
disappears
after
a
few
moments
of
torpor
he
draws
it
in
slowly
as
he
draws
it
in
it
becomes
heavier
just
as
he
is
about
to
fish
it
out
of
the
water
he
stops
to
take
breath
he
knows
that
he
has
his
prey
he
does
not
know
what
it
is
he
prolongs
the
pleasure
of
expectancy
at
last
he
makes
up
his
mind
fish
with
gleaming
scales
appear
from
the
water
they
writhe
like
a
nest
of
snakes
he
looks
at
them
curiously
he
stirs
them
with
his
finger
but
hardly
has
he
drawn
them
from
the
water
than
their
colors
fade
and
they
slip
between
his
fingers
he
throws
them
back
into
the
water
and
begins
to
fish
for
others
he
is
more
eager
to
see
one
after
another
all
the
dreams
stirring
in
him
than
to
catch
at
any
one
of
them
they
all
seem
more
beautiful
to
him
when
they
are
freely
swimming
in
the
transparent
lake
he
caught
all
kinds
of
them
each
more
extravagant
than
the
last
ideas
had
been
heaped
up
in
him
for
months
and
he
had
not
drawn
upon
them
so
that
he
was
bursting
with
riches
but
it
was
all
his
mind
was
a
babel
an
old
jew
curiosity
shop
in
which
there
were
piled
up
in
the
one
room
rare
treasures
precious
stuffs
and
rags
he
could
not
distinguish
their
values
everything
amused
him
there
were
thrilling
chords
colors
which
rang
like
bells
harmonies
which
buzzed
like
bees
melodies
smiling
like
lovers
lips
there
were
visions
of
the
country
faces
passions
souls
characters
literary
ideas
metaphysical
ideas
there
were
great
projects
vast
and
impossible
tetralogies
decalogies
pretending
to
depict
everything
in
music
covering
whole
worlds
and
most
often
there
were
obscure
flashing
sensations
called
forth
by
a
trifle
the
sound
of
a
voice
a
man
or
a
woman
passing
in
the
street
the
pattering
of
rain
an
inward
many
of
these
projects
advanced
no
further
than
their
title
most
of
them
were
never
more
than
a
note
or
two
it
was
enough
like
all
very
young
people
he
thought
he
had
created
what
he
dreamed
of
creating
but
he
was
too
keenly
alive
to
be
satisfied
for
long
with
such
fantasies
he
wearied
of
an
illusory
possession
he
wished
to
seize
his
how
to
begin
they
seemed
to
him
all
equally
important
he
turned
and
turned
them
he
rejected
them
he
took
them
up
again
no
he
never
took
them
up
again
they
were
no
longer
the
same
they
were
never
to
be
caught
twice
they
were
always
changing
they
changed
in
his
hands
under
his
eyes
while
he
was
watching
them
he
must
make
haste
he
could
not
he
was
appalled
by
the
slowness
with
which
he
worked
he
would
have
liked
to
do
everything
in
one
day
and
he
found
it
horribly
difficult
to
complete
the
smallest
thing
his
dreams
were
passing
and
he
was
passing
himself
while
he
was
doing
one
thing
it
worried
him
not
to
be
doing
another
it
was
as
though
it
was
enough
to
have
chosen
one
of
his
fine
subjects
for
it
to
lose
all
interest
for
him
and
so
all
his
riches
availed
him
nothing
his
thoughts
had
life
only
on
condition
that
he
did
not
tamper
with
them
everything
that
he
succeeded
in
doing
was
it
was
the
torment
of
tantalus
within
reach
were
fruits
that
became
stones
as
soon
as
he
plucked
them
near
his
lips
was
a
clear
stream
which
sank
away
whenever
he
bent
down
to
drink
to
slake
his
thirst
lie
tried
to
sip
at
the
springs
that
he
had
conquered
his
old
compositions
loathsome
in
taste
at
the
first
gulp
he
spat
it
out
again
cursing
what
that
tepid
water
that
insipid
music
was
that
his
music
he
read
through
all
his
compositions
he
was
horrified
he
understood
not
a
note
of
them
he
could
not
even
understand
how
he
had
come
to
write
them
he
blushed
once
after
reading
through
a
page
more
foolish
than
the
rest
he
turned
round
to
make
sure
that
there
was
nobody
in
the
room
and
then
he
went
and
hid
his
face
in
his
pillow
like
a
child
ashamed
sometimes
they
seemed
to
him
so
preposterously
silly
that
they
were
quite
funny
and
he
forgot
that
they
were
his
own
what
an
idiot
he
would
cry
rocking
with
laughter
but
nothing
touched
him
more
than
those
compositions
in
which
he
had
set
out
to
express
his
own
passionate
feelings
the
sorrows
and
joys
of
love
then
he
would
bound
in
his
chair
as
though
a
fly
had
stung
him
he
would
thump
on
the
table
beat
his
head
and
roar
angrily
he
would
coarsely
apostrophize
himself
he
would
vow
himself
to
be
a
swine
trebly
a
scoundrel
a
clod
and
a
clown
a
whole
litany
of
denunciation
in
the
end
he
would
go
and
stand
before
his
mirror
red
with
shouting
and
then
he
would
take
hold
of
his
chin
and
say
look
look
you
scurvy
knave
look
at
the
that
is
yours
teach
you

you
blackguard
water
sir
water
he
would
plunge
his
face
into
his
basin
and
hold
it
under
water
until
he
was
like
to
choke
when
he
drew
himself
up
scarlet
with
his
eyes
starting
from
his
head
snorting
like
a
seal
he
would
rush
to
his
table
without
bothering
to
sponge
away
the
water
trickling
down
him
he
would
seize
the
unhappy
compositions
angrily
tear
them
in
pieces
growling
there
you
beast
there
there
there
then
he
would
recover
what
exasperated
him
most
in
his
compositions
was
their
untruth
not
a
spark
of
feeling
in
them
a
phraseology
got
by
heart
a
rhetoric
he
spoke
of
love
like
a
blind
man
of
color
he
spoke
of
it
from
hearsay
only
repeating
the
current
platitudes
and
it
was
not
only
love
it
was
the
same
with
all
the
passions
which
had
been
used
for
themes
and
and
yet
he
had
always
tried
to
be
but
it
is
not
enough
to
wish
to
be
sincere
it
is
necessary
to
have
the
power
to
be
so
and
how
can
a
man
be
so
when
as
yet
he
knows
nothing
of
life
what
had
revealed
the
falseness
of
his
work
what
had
suddenly
digged
a
pit
between
himself
and
his
past
was
the
experience
which
he
had
had
during
the
last
six
months
of
life
he
had
left
fantasy
there
was
now
in
him
a
real
standard
to
which
he
could
bring
all
the
thoughts
for
judgment
as
to
their
truth
or
untruth
the
disgust
which
his
old
work
written
without
passion
roused
in
him
made
him
decide
with
his
usual
exaggeration
that
he
would
write
no
more
until
he
was
forced
to
write
by
some
passionate
need
and
leaving
the
pursuit
of
his
ideas
at
that
he
swore
that
he
would
renounce
music
forever
unless
creation
were
imposed
upon
him
in
a
thunderclap
he
made
this
resolve
because
he
knew
quite
well
that
the
storm
was
coming
thunder
falls
when
it
will
and
where
it
will
but
there
are
peaks
which
attract
it
certain
places
certain
souls
breed
storms
they
create
them
or
draw
them
from
all
points
of
the
horizon
and
certain
ages
of
life
like
certain
months
of
the
year
are
so
saturated
with
electricity
that
thunderstorms
are
produced
in
them
if
not
at
will
at
any
rate
when
they
are
expected
the
whole
being
of
a
man
is
taut
for
it
often
the
storm
lies
brooding
for
days
and
days
the
pale
sky
is
hung
with
burning
fleecy
clouds
no
wind
stirs
the
still
air
ferments
and
seems
to
boil
the
earth
lies
in
a
stupor
no
sound
comes
from
it
the
brain
hums
feverishly
all
nature
awaits
the
explosion
of
the
gathering
forces
the
thud
of
the
hammer
which
is
slowly
rising
to
fall
back
suddenly
on
the
anvil
of
the
clouds
dark
warm
shadows
pass
a
fiery
wind
rises
through
the
body
the
nerves
quiver
like
leaves
then
silence
falls
again
the
sky
goes
on
gathering
thunder
in
such
expectancy
there
is
voluptuous
anguish
in
spite
of
the
discomfort
that
weighs
so
heavily
upon
you
you
feel
in
your
veins
the
fire
which
is
consuming
the
universe
the
soul
surfeited
boils
in
the
furnace
like
wine
in
a
vat
thousands
of
germs
of
life
and
death
are
in
labor
in
it
what
will
issue
from
it
the
soul
knows
not
like
a
woman
with
child
it
is
silent
it
gazes
in
upon
itself
it
listens
anxiously
for
the
stirring
in
its
womb
and
thinks
what
will
be
born
of
me
sometimes
such
waiting
is
in
vain
the
storm
passes
without
breaking
but
you
wake
heavy
cheated
enervated
disheartened
but
it
is
only
postponed
the
storm
will
break
if
not
then
the
longer
it
is
delayed
the
more
violent
will
it
be
now
it
comes
the
clouds
have
come
up
from
all
corners
of
the
soul
thick
masses
blue
and
black
torn
by
the
frantic
darting
of
the
lightning
they
advance
heavily
drunkenly
darkening
the
soul
horizon
blotting
out
light
an
hour
of
madness
the
exasperated
elements
let
loose
from
the
cage
in
which
they
are
held
bound
by
the
laws
which
hold
the
balance
between
the
mind
and
the
existence
of
things
reign
formless
and
colossal
in
the
night
of
consciousness
the
soul
is
in
agony
there
is
no
longer
the
will
to
live
there
is
only
longing
for
the
end
for
the
deliverance
of
death
and
suddenly
there
is
lightning
christophe
shouted
for
joy
joy
furious
joy
the
sun
that
lights
up
all
that
is
and
will
be
the
godlike
joy
of
creation
there
is
no
joy
but
in
creation
there
are
no
living
beings
but
those
who
create
all
the
rest
are
shadows
hovering
over
the
earth
strangers
to
life
all
the
joys
of
life
are
the
joys
of
creation
love
genius
action
quickened
by
flames
issuing
from
one
and
the
same
fire
even
those
who
can
not
find
a
place
by
the
great
fireside
the
ambitious
the
egoists
the
sterile
sensualists
try
to
gain
warmth
in
the
pale
reflections
of
its
light
to
create
in
the
region
of
the
body
or
in
the
region
of
the
mind
is
to
issue
from
the
prison
of
the
body
it
is
to
ride
upon
the
storm
of
life
it
is
to
be
he
who
is
to
create
is
to
triumph
over
death
wretched
is
the
sterile
creature
that
man
or
that
woman
who
remains
alone
and
lost
upon
the
earth
scanning
their
withered
bodies
and
the
sight
of
themselves
from
which
no
flame
of
life
will
ever
leap
wretched
is
the
soul
that
does
not
feel
its
own
fruitfulness
and
know
itself
to
be
big
with
life
and
love
as
a
tree
with
blossom
in
the
spring
the
world
may
heap
honors
and
benefits
upon
such
a
soul
it
does
but
crown
a
corpse
when
christophe
was
struck
by
the
flash
of
lightning
an
electric
fluid
coursed
through
his
body
he
trembled
under
the
shock
it
was
as
though
on
the
high
seas
in
the
dark
night
he
had
suddenly
sighted
land
or
it
was
as
though
in
a
crowd
he
had
gazed
into
two
eyes
saluting
him
often
it
would
happen
to
him
after
hours
of
prostration
when
his
mind
was
leaping
desperately
through
the
void
but
more
often
still
it
came
in
moments
when
he
was
thinking
of
something
else
talking
to
his
mother
or
walking
through
the
streets
if
he
were
in
the
street
a
certain
human
respect
kept
him
from
too
loudly
demonstrating
his
joy
but
if
he
were
at
home
nothing
could
keep
him
back
he
would
stamp
he
would
sound
a
blare
of
triumph
his
mother
knew
that
well
and
she
had
come
to
know
what
it
meant
she
used
to
tell
christophe
that
he
was
like
a
hen
that
has
laid
an
egg
he
was
permeated
with
his
musical
imagination
sometimes
it
took
shape
in
an
isolated
phrase
complete
in
itself
more
often
it
would
appear
as
a
nebula
enveloping
a
whole
work
the
structure
of
the
work
its
general
lines
could
be
perceived
through
a
veil
torn
asunder
here
and
there
by
dazzling
phrases
which
stood
out
from
the
darkness
with
the
clarity
of
sculpture
it
was
only
a
flash
sometimes
others
would
come
in
quick
succession
each
lit
up
other
corners
of
the
night
but
usually
the
capricious
force
haying
once
shown
itself
unexpectedly
would
disappear
again
for
several
days
into
its
mysterious
retreats
leaving
behind
it
a
luminous
ray
this
delight
in
inspiration
was
so
vivid
that
christophe
was
disgusted
by
everything
else
the
experienced
artist
knows
that
inspiration
is
rare
and
that
intelligence
is
left
to
complete
the
work
of
intuition
he
puts
his
ideas
under
the
press
and
squeezes
out
of
them
the
last
drop
of
the
divine
juices
that
are
in
them
and
if
need
be
sometimes
he
does
not
shrink
from
diluting
them
with
clear
water
christophe
was
too
young
and
too
sure
of
himself
not
to
despise
such
contemptible
practices
he
dreamed
impossibly
of
producing
nothing
that
was
not
absolutely
spontaneous
if
he
had
not
been
deliberately
blind
he
would
certainly
have
seen
the
absurdity
of
his
aims
ho
doubt
he
was
at
that
time
in
a
period
of
inward
abundance
in
which
there
was
no
gap
no
chink
through
which
boredom
or
emptiness
could
creep
everything
served
as
an
excuse
to
his
inexhaustible
fecundity
everything
that
his
eyes
saw
or
his
ears
heard
everything
with
which
he
came
in
contact
in
his
daily
life
every
look
every
word
brought
forth
a
crop
of
dreams
in
the
boundless
heaven
of
his
thoughts
he
saw
circling
millions
of
milky
stars
rivers
of
living
and
yet
even
then
there
were
moments
when
everything
was
suddenly
blotted
out
and
although
the
night
could
not
endure
although
he
had
hardly
time
to
suffer
from
these
long
silences
of
his
soul
he
did
not
escape
a
secret
terror
of
that
unknown
power
which
came
upon
him
left
him
came
again
and
disappeared
how
long
this
time
would
it
ever
come
again
his
pride
rejected
that
thought
and
said
this
force
is
myself
when
it
ceases
to
be
i
shall
cease
to
be
i
shall
kill
myself
he
never
ceased
to
tremble
but
it
was
only
another
delight
but
if
for
the
moment
there
was
no
danger
of
the
spring
running
dry
christophe
was
able
already
to
perceive
that
it
was
never
enough
to
fertilize
a
complete
work
ideas
almost
always
appeared
rawly
he
had
painfully
to
dig
them
out
of
the
and
always
they
appeared
without
any
sort
of
sequence
and
by
fits
and
starts
to
unite
them
he
had
to
bring
to
bear
on
them
an
element
of
reflection
and
deliberation
and
cold
will
which
fashioned
them
into
new
form
christophe
was
too
much
of
an
artist
not
to
do
so
but
he
would
not
accept
it
he
forced
himself
to
believe
that
he
did
no
more
than
transcribe
what
was
within
himself
while
he
was
always
compelled
more
or
less
to
transform
it
so
as
to
make
it
more
than
that
sometimes
he
would
absolutely
forge
a
meaning
for
it
however
violently
the
musical
idea
might
come
upon
him
it
would
often
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
say
what
it
meant
it
would
come
surging
up
from
the
depths
of
life
from
far
beyond
the
limits
of
consciousness
and
in
that
absolutely
pure
force
which
eluded
common
rhythms
consciousness
could
never
recognize
in
it
any
of
the
motives
which
stirred
in
it
none
of
the
human
feelings
which
it
defines
and
classifies
joys
sorrows
they
were
all
merged
in
one
single
passion
which
was
unintelligible
because
it
was
above
the
intelligence
and
yet
whether
it
understood
or
no
the
intelligence
needed
to
give
a
name
to
this
form
to
bind
it
down
to
one
or
other
of
the
structures
of
logic
which
man
is
forever
building
indefatigably
in
the
hive
of
his
brain
so
christophe
convinced
himself
he
wished
to
do
so
that
the
obscure
power
that
moved
him
had
an
exact
meaning
and
that
its
meaning
was
in
accordance
with
his
will
his
free
instinct
risen
from
the
unconscious
depths
was
forced
to
plod
on
under
the
yoke
of
reason
with
perfectly
clear
ideas
which
had
nothing
at
all
in
common
with
it
and
work
so
produced
was
no
more
than
a
lying
juxtaposition
of
one
of
those
great
subjects
that
christophe
mind
had
marked
out
for
itself
and
those
wild
forces
which
had
an
altogether
different
meaning
unknown
to
himself
he
groped
his
way
head
down
borne
on
by
the
contradictory
forces
warring
in
him
and
hurling
into
his
incoherent
works
a
fiery
and
strong
quality
of
life
which
he
could
not
express
though
he
was
joyously
and
proudly
conscious
of
it
the
consciousness
of
his
new
vigor
made
him
able
for
the
first
time
to
envisage
squarely
everything
about
him
everything
that
he
had
been
taught
to
honor
everything
that
he
had
respected
without
question
and
he
judged
it
all
with
insolent
freedom
the
veil
was
rent
he
saw
the
german
lie
every
race
every
art
has
its
hypocrisy
the
world
is
fed
with
a
little
truth
and
many
lies
the
human
mind
is
feeble
pure
truth
agrees
with
it
but
ill
its
religion
its
morality
its
states
its
poets
its
artists
must
all
be
presented
to
it
swathed
in
lies
these
lies
are
adapted
to
the
mind
of
each
race
they
vary
from
one
to
the
other
it
is
they
that
make
it
so
difficult
for
nations
to
understand
each
other
and
so
easy
for
them
to
despise
each
other
truth
is
the
same
for
all
of
us
but
every
nation
has
its
own
lie
which
it
calls
its
idealism
every
creature
therein
breathes
it
from
birth
to
death
it
has
become
a
condition
of
life
there
are
only
a
few
men
of
genius
who
can
break
free
from
it
through
heroic
moments
of
crisis
when
they
are
alone
in
the
free
world
of
their
thoughts
it
was
a
trivial
thing
which
suddenly
revealed
to
christophe
the
lie
of
german
art
it
was
not
because
it
had
not
always
been
visible
that
he
had
not
seen
it
he
was
not
near
it
he
had
not
recoiled
from
it
now
the
mountain
appeared
to
his
gaze
because
he
had
moved
away
from
it
he
was
at
a
concert
of
the
the
concert
was
given
in
a
large
hall
occupied
by
ten
or
twelve
rows
of
little
tables
about
two
or
three
hundred
of
them
at
the
end
of
the
room
was
a
stage
where
the
orchestra
was
sitting
all
round
christophe
were
officers
dressed
up
in
their
long
dark
coats
with
broad
shaven
faces
red
serious
and
commonplace
women
talking
and
laughing
noisily
ostentatiously
at
their
ease
jolly
little
girls
smiling
and
showing
all
their
teeth
and
large
men
hidden
behind
their
beards
and
spectacles
looking
like
kindly
spiders
with
round
eyes
they
got
up
with
every
fresh
glass
to
drink
a
toast
they
did
this
almost
religiously
their
faces
their
voices
changed
it
was
as
though
they
were
saying
mass
they
offered
each
other
the
libations
they
drank
of
the
chalice
with
a
mixture
of
solemnity
and
buffoonery
the
music
was
drowned
under
the
conversation
and
the
clinking
of
glasses
and
yet
everybody
was
trying
to
talk
and
eat
quietly
the
a
tall
bent
old
man
with
a
white
beard
hanging
like
a
tail
from
his
chin
and
a
long
aquiline
nose
with
spectacles
looked
like
a
all
these
types
were
familiar
to
christophe
but
on
that
day
he
had
an
inclination
he
did
not
know
why
to
see
them
as
caricatures
there
are
days
like
that
when
for
no
apparent
reason
the
grotesque
in
people
and
things
which
in
ordinary
life
passes
unnoticed
suddenly
leaps
into
view
the
programme
of
the
music
included
the
overture
a
valse
of
waldteufel
pilgrimage
to
the
overture
to
the
of
nicolai
the
religious
march
of
and
a
fantasy
on
the
the
orchestra
played
the
beethoven
overture
correctly
and
the
valse
deliciously
during
the
of
the
uncorking
of
bottles
was
heard
a
big
man
sitting
at
the
table
next
to
christophe
beat
time
to
the
by
imitating
falstaff
a
stout
old
lady
in
a
pale
blue
dress
with
a
white
belt
golden
on
her
flat
nose
red
arms
and
an
enormous
waist
sang
in
a
loud
voice
of
schumann
and
brahms
she
raised
her
eyebrows
made
eyes
at
the
wings
smiled
with
a
smile
that
seemed
to
curdle
on
her
made
exaggerated
gestures
which
must
certainly
have
called
to
mind
the
but
for
the
majestic
honesty
which
shone
in
her
this
mother
of
a
family
played
the
part
of
the
giddy
girl
youth
passion
and
schumann
poetry
had
a
faint
smack
of
the
nursery
the
audience
was
in
but
they
grew
solemn
and
attentive
when
there
appeared
the
choral
society
of
the
germans
of
the
south
männer
who
alternately
cooed
and
roared
part
songs
full
of
feeling
there
were
forty
and
they
sang
four
parts
it
seemed
as
though
they
had
set
themselves
to
free
their
execution
of
every
trace
of
style
that
could
properly
be
called
choral
a
of
little
melodious
effects
little
timid
puling
shades
of
sound
dying
with
sudden
swelling
roaring
like
some
one
heating
on
an
empty
box
no
breadth
or
balance
a
mawkish
style
it
was
like
bottom
let
me
play
the
lion
i
will
roar
you
as
gently
as
any
sucking
dove
i
will
roar
you
as
it
were
a
nightingale
christophe
listened
foam
the
beginning
with
growing
amazement
there
was
nothing
new
in
it
all
to
him
he
knew
these
concerts
the
orchestra
the
audience
but
suddenly
it
all
seemed
to
him
false
all
of
it
even
to
what
he
most
loved
the
overture
in
which
the
pompous
disorder
and
correct
agitation
hurt
him
in
that
hour
like
a
want
of
frankness
no
doubt
it
was
not
beethoven
or
schumann
that
he
heard
but
their
absurd
interpreters
their
audience
whose
crass
stupidity
was
spread
about
their
works
like
a
heavy
no
matter
there
was
in
the
works
even
the
most
beautiful
of
them
a
disturbing
quality
which
christophe
had
never
before
what
was
it
he
dared
not
analyze
it
deeming
it
a
sacrilege
to
question
his
beloved
masters
but
in
vain
did
he
shut
his
eyes
to
it
he
had
seen
it
and
in
spite
of
himself
he
went
on
seeing
it
like
the
at
pisa
he
looked
between
his
fingers
he
saw
german
art
stripped
all
of
them
the
great
and
the
idiots
laid
bare
their
souls
with
a
complacent
tenderness
emotion
overflowed
moral
nobility
trickled
down
their
hearts
melted
in
distracted
effusions
the
sluice
gates
were
opened
to
the
fearful
german
it
weakened
the
energy
of
the
stronger
it
drowned
the
weaker
under
its
grayish
waters
it
was
a
flood
in
the
depths
of
it
slept
german
thought
and
what
thoughts
were
those
of
a
mendelssohn
a
brahms
a
schumann
and
following
them
the
whole
legion
of
little
writers
of
affected
and
tearful
built
on
sand
never
rock
wet
and
shapeless
it
was
all
so
foolish
so
childish
often
that
christophe
could
not
believe
that
it
never
occurred
to
the
audience
he
looked
about
him
but
he
saw
only
gaping
faces
convinced
in
advance
of
the
beauties
they
were
hearing
and
the
pleasure
that
they
ought
to
find
in
it
how
could
they
admit
their
own
right
to
judge
for
themselves
they
were
filled
with
respect
for
these
hallowed
names
what
did
they
not
respect
they
were
respectful
before
their
programmes
before
their
glasses
before
themselves
it
was
clear
that
mentally
they
dubbed
everything
excellent
that
remotely
or
nearly
concerned
them
christophe
passed
in
review
the
audience
and
the
music
alternately
the
music
reflected
the
audience
the
audience
reflected
the
music
christophe
felt
laughter
overcoming
him
and
he
made
faces
however
he
controlled
himself
but
when
the
germans
of
the
south
came
and
solemnly
sang
the
that
reminded
him
of
the
blushes
of
a
girl
in
love
christophe
could
not
contain
himself
he
shouted
with
laughter
indignant
cries
of
ssh
were
raised
his
neighbors
looked
at
him
scared
their
honest
scandalized
faces
filled
him
with
joy
he
laughed
louder
than
ever
he
laughed
he
laughed
until
he
cried
suddenly
the
audience
grew
angry
they
cried
put
him
out
he
got
up
and
went
shrugging
his
shoulders
shaking
with
suppressed
laughter
his
departure
caused
a
scandal
it
was
the
beginning
of
hostilities
between
christophe
and
his
birthplace
after
that
experience
christophe
shut
himself
up
and
set
himself
to
read
once
more
the
works
of
the
hallowed
musicians
he
was
appalled
to
find
that
certain
of
the
masters
whom
he
loved
most
had
he
tried
hard
to
doubt
it
at
first
to
believe
that
he
was
but
no
there
was
no
way
out
of
it
he
was
staggered
by
the
conglomeration
of
mediocrity
and
untruth
which
constitutes
the
artistic
treasure
of
a
great
people
how
many
pages
could
bear
examination
from
that
time
on
he
could
begin
to
read
other
works
other
masters
who
were
dear
to
him
only
with
a
fluttering
heart
alas
there
was
some
spell
cast
upon
him
always
there
was
the
same
discomfiture
with
some
of
them
his
heart
was
rent
it
was
as
though
he
had
lost
a
dear
friend
as
if
he
had
suddenly
seen
that
a
friend
in
whom
he
had
reposed
entire
confidence
had
been
deceiving
him
for
years
he
wept
for
it
he
did
not
sleep
at
night
he
could
not
escape
his
torment
he
blamed
himself
perhaps
he
had
lost
his
judgment
perhaps
he
had
become
altogether
an
idiot
no
no
more
than
ever
he
saw
the
radiant
beauty
of
the
day
and
with
more
freshness
and
love
than
ever
he
felt
the
generous
abundance
of
life
his
heart
was
not
deceiving
him
but
for
a
long
time
he
dared
not
approach
those
who
were
the
best
for
him
the
purest
the
holy
of
holies
he
trembled
at
the
thought
of
bringing
his
faith
in
them
to
the
test
but
how
resist
the
pitiless
instinct
of
a
brave
and
truthful
soul
which
will
go
on
to
the
end
and
see
things
as
they
are
whatever
suffering
may
be
got
in
doing
so
so
he
opened
the
sacred
works
he
called
upon
the
last
reserve
the
imperial
guard
at
the
first
glance
he
saw
that
they
were
no
more
immaculate
than
the
others
he
had
not
the
courage
to
go
on
every
now
and
then
he
stopped
and
closed
the
book
like
the
son
of
noah
he
threw
his
cloak
about
his
father
nakedness
then
he
was
prostrate
in
the
midst
of
all
these
ruins
he
would
rather
have
lost
an
arm
than
have
tampered
with
his
blessed
illusions
in
his
heart
he
mourned
but
there
was
so
much
sap
in
him
so
much
reserve
of
life
that
his
confidence
in
art
was
not
shaken
with
a
young
man
naïve
presumption
he
began
life
again
as
though
no
one
had
ever
lived
it
before
him
intoxicated
by
his
new
strength
he
felt
not
without
reason
perhaps
that
with
a
very
few
exceptions
there
is
almost
no
relation
between
living
passion
and
the
expression
which
art
has
striven
to
give
to
it
but
he
was
mistaken
in
thinking
himself
more
happy
or
more
true
when
he
expressed
it
as
he
was
filled
with
passion
it
was
easy
for
him
to
discover
it
at
the
back
of
what
he
had
written
but
no
one
else
would
have
recognized
it
through
the
imperfect
vocabulary
with
which
he
designated
its
variations
many
artists
whom
he
condemned
were
in
the
same
case
they
had
had
and
had
translated
profound
emotions
but
the
secret
of
their
language
had
died
with
them
christophe
was
no
psychologist
he
was
not
bothered
with
all
these
arguments
what
was
dead
for
him
had
always
been
so
he
revised
his
judgment
of
the
past
with
all
the
confident
and
fierce
injustice
of
youth
he
stripped
the
noblest
souls
and
had
no
pity
for
their
foibles
there
were
the
rich
melancholy
the
distinguished
fantasy
the
kindly
thinking
emptiness
of
mendelssohn
there
were
the
and
the
affectation
of
weber
his
dryness
of
heart
his
cerebral
emotion
there
was
liszt
the
noble
priest
the
circus
rider
and
vagabond
a
mixture
in
equal
doses
of
real
and
false
nobility
of
serene
idealism
and
disgusting
virtuosity
schubert
swallowed
up
by
his
sentimentality
drowned
at
the
bottom
of
leagues
of
stale
transparent
water
the
men
of
the
heroic
ages
the
the
prophets
the
fathers
of
the
church
were
not
spared
even
the
great
sebastian
the
man
of
ages
who
bore
in
himself
the
past
and
the
future
bach
was
not
free
of
untruth
of
fashionable
folly
of
the
man
who
had
seen
god
the
man
who
lived
in
god
seemed
sometimes
to
christophe
to
have
had
an
insipid
and
sugared
religion
a
jesuitical
style
rococo
in
his
cantatas
there
were
languorous
and
devout
airs
dialogues
of
the
soul
coquetting
with
jesus
which
sickened
christophe
then
he
seemed
to
see
chubby
cherubim
with
round
limbs
and
flying
draperies
and
also
he
had
a
feeling
that
the
genial
always
wrote
in
a
closed
room
his
work
smacked
of
stuffiness
there
was
not
in
his
music
that
brave
outdoor
air
that
was
breathed
in
others
not
such
great
musicians
perhaps
but
greater
men
more
human
than
he
like
beethoven
or
händel
what
hurt
him
in
all
of
them
especially
in
the
classics
was
their
lack
of
freedom
almost
all
their
works
were
constructed
sometimes
an
emotion
was
filled
out
with
all
the
commonplaces
of
musical
rhetoric
sometimes
with
a
simple
rhythm
an
ornamental
design
repeated
turned
upside
down
combined
in
every
conceivable
way
in
a
mechanical
fashion
these
symmetrical
and
twaddling
constructions
classical
and
sonatas
and
symphonies
exasperated
christophe
who
at
that
time
was
not
very
sensible
of
the
beauty
of
order
and
vast
and
plans
that
seemed
to
him
to
be
rather
masons
work
than
musicians
but
he
was
no
less
severe
with
the
romantics
it
was
a
strange
thing
and
he
was
more
surprised
by
it
than
anybody
but
no
musicians
irritated
him
more
than
those
who
had
pretended
to
be
and
had
actually
been
the
most
free
the
most
spontaneous
the
least
constructive
those
who
like
schumann
had
poured
drop
by
drop
minute
by
minute
into
their
innumerable
little
works
their
whole
life
he
was
the
more
indignantly
in
revolt
against
them
as
he
recognized
in
them
his
adolescent
soul
and
all
the
follies
that
he
had
vowed
to
pluck
out
of
it
in
truth
the
candid
schumann
could
not
be
taxed
with
falsity
he
hardly
ever
said
anything
that
he
had
not
felt
but
that
was
just
it
his
example
made
christophe
understand
that
the
worst
falsity
in
german
art
came
into
it
not
when
the
artists
tried
to
express
something
which
they
had
not
felt
but
rather
when
they
tried
to
express
the
feelings
which
they
did
in
fact
feel
which
were
music
is
an
implacable
mirror
of
the
soul
the
more
a
german
musician
is
naïve
and
in
good
faith
the
more
he
displays
the
weaknesses
of
the
german
soul
its
uncertain
depths
its
soft
tenderness
its
want
of
frankness
its
rather
sly
idealism
its
incapacity
for
seeing
itself
for
daring
to
come
face
to
face
with
itself
that
false
idealism
is
the
secret
sore
even
of
the
greatest
of
wagner
as
he
read
his
works
christophe
ground
his
teeth
seemed
to
him
a
blatant
lie
he
loathed
the
huxtering
chivalry
the
hypocritical
mummery
the
hero
without
fear
and
without
a
heart
the
incarnation
of
cold
and
selfish
virtue
admiring
itself
and
most
patently
he
knew
it
too
well
he
had
seen
it
in
reality
the
type
of
german
pharisee
foppish
impeccable
and
hard
bowing
down
before
its
own
image
the
divinity
to
which
it
has
no
scruple
about
sacrificing
others
the
overwhelmed
him
with
its
massive
sentimentality
and
its
gloomy
boredom
the
loves
of
the
barbarous
decadents
of
the
were
of
a
sickening
staleness
siegmund
carrying
off
his
sister
sang
a
tenor
song
siegfried
and
brünnhilde
like
respectable
german
married
people
in
the
laid
bare
before
each
other
especially
for
the
benefit
of
the
audience
their
pompous
and
voluble
conjugal
passion
every
sort
of
lie
had
arranged
to
meet
in
that
work
false
idealism
false
christianity
false
gothicism
false
legend
false
gods
false
humans
never
did
more
monstrous
convention
appear
than
in
that
theater
which
was
to
upset
all
the
conventions
neither
eyes
nor
mind
nor
heart
could
be
deceived
by
it
for
a
moment
if
they
were
then
they
must
wish
to
be
they
did
wish
to
be
so
germany
was
delighted
with
that
doting
childish
art
an
art
of
brutes
let
loose
and
mystic
little
girls
and
christophe
could
do
nothing
as
soon
as
he
heard
the
music
he
was
caught
up
like
the
others
more
than
the
others
by
the
flood
and
the
diabolical
will
of
the
man
who
had
let
it
loose
he
laughed
and
he
trembled
and
his
cheeks
burned
and
he
felt
galloping
armies
rushing
through
him
and
he
thought
that
those
who
bore
such
storms
within
themselves
might
have
all
allowances
made
for
them
what
cries
of
joy
he
uttered
when
in
the
hallowed
works
which
he
could
not
read
without
trembling
he
felt
once
more
his
old
emotion
ardent
still
with
nothing
to
tarnish
the
purity
of
what
he
loved
these
were
glorious
relics
that
he
saved
from
the
wreck
what
happiness
they
gave
him
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
saved
a
part
of
himself
and
was
it
not
himself
these
great
germans
against
whom
he
revolted
were
they
not
his
blood
his
flesh
his
most
precious
life
he
was
only
severe
with
them
because
he
was
severe
with
himself
who
loved
them
better
than
he
who
felt
more
than
he
the
goodness
of
schubert
the
innocence
of
haydn
the
tenderness
of
mozart
the
great
heroic
heart
of
beethoven
who
more
often
than
he
took
refuge
in
the
murmuring
of
the
forests
of
weber
and
the
cool
shade
of
the
cathedrals
of
john
sebastian
raising
against
the
gray
sky
of
the
north
above
the
plains
of
germany
their
pile
of
stone
and
their
gigantic
towers
with
their
spires
but
he
suffered
from
their
lies
and
he
could
not
forget
them
he
attributed
them
to
the
race
their
greatness
to
themselves
he
was
wrong
greatness
and
weaknesses
belong
equally
to
the
race
whose
great
shifting
thought
flows
like
the
greatest
river
of
music
and
poetry
at
which
europe
comes
to
and
in
what
other
people
would
he
have
found
the
simple
purity
which
now
made
it
possible
for
him
to
condemn
it
so
harshly
he
had
no
notion
of
that
with
the
ingratitude
of
a
spoiled
child
he
turned
against
his
mother
the
weapons
which
he
had
received
from
her
later
later
he
was
to
feel
all
that
he
owed
to
her
and
how
dear
she
was
to
him
but
he
was
in
a
phase
of
blind
reaction
against
all
the
idols
of
his
childhood
he
was
angry
with
himself
and
with
them
because
he
had
believed
in
them
absolutely
and
passionately
and
it
was
well
that
it
was
so
there
is
an
age
in
life
when
we
must
dare
to
be
unjust
when
we
must
make
a
clean
sweep
of
all
admiration
and
respect
got
at
and
deny
everything
truth
and
untruth
everything
which
we
have
not
of
ourselves
known
for
truth
through
education
and
through
everything
that
he
sees
and
hears
about
him
a
child
absorbs
so
many
lies
and
blind
follies
mixed
with
the
essential
verities
of
life
that
the
first
duty
of
the
adolescent
who
wishes
to
grow
into
a
healthy
man
is
to
sacrifice
everything
christophe
was
passing
through
that
crisis
of
healthy
disgust
his
instinct
was
impelling
him
to
eliminate
from
his
life
all
the
undigested
elements
which
encumbered
it
first
of
all
to
go
was
that
sickening
sweet
tenderness
which
sucked
away
the
soul
of
germany
like
a
damp
and
moldy
riverbed
light
light
a
rough
dry
wind
which
should
sweep
away
the
miasmas
of
the
swamp
the
misty
staleness
of
the
liedchen
as
numerous
as
drops
of
rain
in
which
inexhaustibly
the
germanic
is
poured
forth
the
countless
things
like
desire
homesickness
soaring
a
question
why
den
to
the
moon
die
to
the
stars
die
to
the
nightingale
den
to
spring
den
to
sunshine
like
spring
song
delights
of
spring
hail
to
the
spring
a
spring
journey
a
spring
night
the
message
of
spring
like
der
the
voice
of
love
der
the
language
of
love
der
love
sorrow
der
the
spirit
of
love
der
the
fullness
of
love
like
the
song
of
the
flowers
the
letter
of
the
flowers
flowers
greeting
like
heart
pangs
herz
ist
my
heart
is
heavy
herz
ist
my
heart
is
troubled
aug
ist
my
eye
is
heavy
like
the
candid
and
silly
dialogues
with
the
the
little
rose
with
the
brook
with
the
turtle
dove
with
the
lark
like
those
idiotic
questions
if
the
briar
could
have
no
thorns
is
an
old
husband
like
a
lark
who
has
built
a
nest
is
she
newly
plighted
the
whole
deluge
of
stale
tenderness
stale
emotion
stale
melancholy
stale
poetry
how
many
lovely
things
profaned
rare
things
used
in
season
or
out
for
the
worst
of
it
was
that
it
was
all
useless
a
habit
of
undressing
their
hearts
in
public
a
fond
and
foolish
propensity
of
the
honest
people
of
germany
for
plunging
loudly
into
confidences
with
nothing
to
say
they
were
always
talking
would
their
chatter
never
cease
as
well
bid
frogs
in
a
pond
be
silent
it
was
in
the
expression
of
love
that
christophe
was
most
rawly
conscious
of
untruth
for
he
was
in
a
position
to
compare
it
with
the
reality
the
conventional
love
songs
lacrymose
and
proper
contained
nothing
like
the
desires
of
man
or
the
heart
of
woman
and
yet
the
people
who
had
written
them
must
have
loved
at
least
once
in
their
lives
was
it
possible
that
they
could
have
loved
like
that
no
no
they
had
lied
as
they
always
did
they
had
lied
to
themselves
they
had
tried
to
idealize
themselves
idealism
that
meant
that
they
were
afraid
of
looking
at
life
squarely
were
incapable
of
seeing
things
like
a
man
as
they
everywhere
the
same
timidity
the
same
lack
of
manly
frankness
everywhere
the
same
chilly
enthusiasm
the
same
pompous
lying
solemnity
in
their
patriotism
in
their
drinking
in
their
religion
the
drinking
songs
were
prosopopeia
to
wine
and
the
bowl
du
herrlich
glas
thou
noble
glass
faith
the
one
thing
in
the
world
which
should
be
spontaneous
springing
from
the
soul
like
an
unexpected
sudden
stream
was
a
manufactured
article
a
commodity
of
trade
their
patriotic
songs
were
made
for
docile
flocks
of
sheep
basking
in
unison
shout
then
what
must
you
go
on
lying
till
you
are
surfeited
till
it
brings
you
to
slaughter
and
madness
christophe
ended
by
hating
all
idealism
he
preferred
frank
brutality
to
such
lying
but
at
heart
he
was
more
of
an
idealist
than
the
rest
and
he
had
not
he
could
not
have
any
more
real
enemies
than
the
brutal
realists
whom
he
thought
he
preferred
he
was
blinded
by
passion
he
was
frozen
by
the
mist
the
anæmic
lying
the
sunless
phantom
ideas
with
his
whole
being
he
reached
upwards
to
the
sun
in
his
youthful
contempt
for
the
hypocrisy
with
which
he
was
surrounded
or
for
what
he
took
to
be
hypocrisy
he
did
not
see
the
high
practical
wisdom
of
the
race
which
little
by
little
had
built
up
for
itself
its
grandiose
idealism
in
order
to
suppress
its
savage
instincts
or
to
turn
them
to
account
not
arbitrary
reasons
not
moral
and
religious
codes
not
legislators
and
statesmen
priests
and
philosophers
transform
the
souls
of
peoples
and
often
impose
upon
them
a
new
nature
but
centuries
of
misfortune
and
experience
which
forge
the
life
of
peoples
who
have
the
will
to
live
and
yet
christophe
went
on
composing
and
his
compositions
were
not
examples
of
the
faults
which
he
found
in
others
in
him
creation
was
an
irresistible
necessity
which
would
not
submit
to
the
rules
which
his
intelligence
laid
down
for
it
no
man
creates
from
reason
but
from
it
is
not
enough
to
have
recognized
the
untruth
and
affectation
inherent
in
the
majority
of
the
feelings
to
avoid
falling
into
them
long
and
painful
endeavor
is
necessary
nothing
is
more
difficult
than
to
be
absolutely
true
in
modern
society
with
its
crushing
heritage
of
indolent
habits
handed
down
through
generations
it
is
especially
difficult
for
those
people
those
nations
who
are
possessed
by
an
indiscreet
mania
for
letting
their
hearts
speak
for
making
them
speak
unceasingly
when
most
generally
it
had
much
better
have
been
silent
christophe
heart
was
very
german
in
that
it
had
not
yet
learned
the
virtue
of
silence
and
that
virtue
did
not
belong
to
his
age
he
had
inherited
from
his
father
a
need
for
talking
and
talking
loudly
he
knew
it
and
struggled
against
it
bat
the
conflict
paralyzed
part
of
his
and
he
had
another
gift
of
heredity
no
less
burdensome
which
had
come
to
him
from
his
grandfather
an
extraordinary
difficulty
in
expressing
himself
he
was
the
son
of
a
he
was
conscious
of
the
dangerous
attraction
of
virtuosity
a
physical
pleasure
the
pleasure
of
skill
of
agility
of
satisfied
muscular
activity
the
pleasure
of
conquering
of
dazzling
of
enthralling
in
his
own
person
the
audience
an
excusable
pleasure
in
a
young
man
almost
an
innocent
pleasure
though
none
the
less
destructive
of
art
and
soul
christophe
knew
it
it
was
in
his
blood
he
despised
it
but
all
the
same
he
yielded
to
it
and
so
torn
between
the
instincts
of
his
race
and
those
of
his
genius
weighed
down
by
the
burden
of
a
parasitical
past
which
covered
him
with
a
crust
that
he
could
not
break
through
he
floundered
along
and
was
much
nearer
than
he
thought
to
all
that
he
shunned
and
banned
all
his
compositions
were
a
mixture
of
truth
and
turgidness
of
lucid
strength
and
faltering
stupidity
it
was
only
in
rare
moments
that
his
personality
could
pierce
the
casing
of
the
dead
personality
which
hampered
his
movements
he
was
alone
he
had
no
guide
to
help
him
out
of
the
mire
when
he
thought
he
was
out
of
it
he
slipped
back
again
he
went
blindly
on
wasting
his
time
and
strength
in
futile
efforts
he
was
spared
no
trial
and
in
the
disorder
of
his
creative
striving
he
never
knew
what
was
of
greatest
worth
in
what
he
created
he
tied
himself
up
in
absurd
projects
symphonic
poems
which
pretended
to
philosophy
and
were
of
monstrous
dimensions
he
was
too
sincere
to
be
able
to
hold
to
them
for
long
together
and
he
would
discard
them
in
disgust
before
he
had
stretched
out
a
single
movement
or
he
would
set
out
to
translate
into
overtures
the
most
inaccessible
works
of
poetry
then
he
would
flounder
about
in
a
domain
which
was
not
his
own
when
he
drew
up
scenarios
for
himself
for
he
stuck
at
nothing
they
were
idiotic
and
when
he
attacked
the
great
works
of
goethe
hebbel
kleist
or
shakespeare
he
understood
them
all
wrong
it
was
not
want
of
intelligence
but
want
of
the
critical
spirit
he
could
not
yet
understand
others
he
was
too
much
taken
up
with
himself
he
found
himself
everywhere
with
his
naïve
and
turgid
soul
but
besides
these
monsters
who
were
not
really
begotten
he
wrote
a
quantity
of
small
pieces
which
were
the
immediate
expression
of
passing
emotions
the
most
eternal
of
all
musical
thoughts
in
this
as
in
other
things
he
was
in
passionate
reaction
against
current
practices
he
would
take
up
the
most
famous
poems
already
set
to
music
and
was
impertinent
enough
to
try
to
treat
them
differently
and
with
greater
truth
than
schumann
and
schubert
sometimes
he
would
try
to
give
to
the
poetic
figures
of
goethe
to
mignon
the
harpist
in
their
individual
character
exact
and
changing
sometimes
he
would
tackle
certain
love
songs
which
the
weakness
of
the
artists
and
the
dullness
of
the
audience
in
tacit
agreement
had
clothed
about
with
sickly
sentimentality
and
he
would
unclothe
them
he
would
restore
to
them
their
rough
crude
sensuality
in
a
word
he
set
out
to
make
passions
and
people
live
for
themselves
and
not
to
serve
as
toys
for
german
families
seeking
an
easy
emotionalism
on
sundays
when
they
sat
about
in
some
but
generally
he
would
find
the
poets
even
the
greatest
of
them
too
literary
and
he
would
select
the
simplest
texts
for
preference
texts
of
old
jolly
old
songs
which
he
had
read
perhaps
in
some
improving
work
he
would
take
care
not
to
preserve
their
choral
character
he
would
treat
them
with
a
fine
lively
and
altogether
lay
audacity
or
he
would
take
words
from
the
gospel
or
proverbs
sometimes
even
words
heard
by
chance
scraps
of
dialogues
of
the
people
children
thoughts
words
often
awkward
and
prosaic
in
which
there
was
only
pure
feeling
with
them
he
was
at
his
ease
and
he
would
reach
a
depth
with
them
which
was
not
in
his
other
compositions
a
depth
which
he
himself
never
suspected
good
or
bad
more
often
bad
than
good
his
works
as
a
whole
had
abounding
vitality
they
were
not
altogether
new
far
from
it
christophe
was
often
banal
through
his
very
sincerity
he
repeated
sometimes
forms
already
used
because
they
exactly
rendered
his
thought
because
he
also
felt
in
that
way
and
not
otherwise
nothing
would
have
induced
him
to
try
to
be
original
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
man
must
be
very
commonplace
to
burden
himself
with
such
an
idea
he
tried
to
be
himself
to
say
what
he
felt
without
worrying
as
to
whether
what
he
said
had
been
said
before
him
or
not
he
took
a
pride
in
believing
that
it
was
the
best
way
of
being
original
and
that
christophe
had
only
been
and
only
would
be
alive
once
with
the
magnificent
impudence
of
youth
nothing
seemed
to
him
to
have
been
done
before
and
everything
seemed
to
him
to
be
left
for
doing
or
for
doing
again
and
the
feeling
of
this
inward
fullness
of
life
of
a
life
stretching
endless
before
him
brought
him
to
a
state
of
exuberant
and
rather
indiscreet
happiness
he
was
perpetually
in
a
state
of
jubilation
which
had
no
need
of
joy
it
could
adapt
itself
to
sorrow
its
source
overflowed
with
life
was
in
its
strength
mother
of
all
happiness
and
virtue
to
live
to
live
too
much
a
man
who
does
not
feel
within
himself
this
intoxication
of
strength
this
jubilation
in
living
even
in
the
depths
of
misery
is
not
an
artist
that
is
the
touchstone
true
greatness
is
shown
in
this
power
of
rejoicing
through
joy
and
sorrow
a
mendelssohn
or
a
brahms
gods
of
the
mists
of
october
and
of
fine
rain
have
never
known
the
divine
power
christophe
was
conscious
of
it
and
he
showed
his
joy
simply
impudently
he
saw
no
harm
in
it
he
only
asked
to
share
it
with
others
he
did
not
see
how
such
joy
hurts
the
majority
of
men
who
never
can
possess
it
and
are
always
envious
of
it
for
the
rest
he
never
bothered
about
pleasing
or
displeasing
he
was
sure
of
himself
and
nothing
seemed
to
him
simpler
than
to
communicate
his
conviction
to
others
to
conquer
instinctively
he
compared
his
riches
with
the
general
poverty
of
the
makers
of
music
and
he
thought
that
it
would
be
very
easy
to
make
his
superiority
recognized
too
easy
even
he
had
only
to
show
himself
he
showed
himself
they
were
waiting
for
him
christophe
had
made
no
secret
of
his
feelings
since
he
had
become
aware
of
german
pharisaism
which
refuses
to
see
things
as
they
are
he
had
made
it
a
law
for
himself
that
he
should
be
absolutely
continually
uncompromisingly
sincere
in
everything
without
regard
for
anything
or
anybody
or
himself
and
as
he
could
do
nothing
without
going
to
extremes
he
was
extravagant
in
his
sincerity
he
would
say
outrageous
things
and
scandalize
people
a
thousand
times
less
naïve
than
himself
he
never
dreamed
that
it
might
annoy
them
when
he
realized
the
idiocy
of
some
hallowed
composition
he
would
make
haste
to
impart
his
discovery
to
everybody
he
encountered
musicians
of
the
orchestra
or
amateurs
of
his
acquaintance
he
would
pronounce
the
most
absurd
judgments
with
a
beaming
face
at
first
no
one
took
him
seriously
they
laughed
at
his
freaks
but
it
was
not
long
before
they
found
that
he
was
always
reverting
to
them
insisting
on
them
in
a
way
that
was
really
bad
taste
it
became
evident
that
christophe
believed
in
his
paradoxes
and
they
became
less
amusing
he
was
a
nuisance
at
concerts
he
would
make
ironic
remarks
in
a
loud
voice
or
would
express
his
scorn
for
the
glorious
masters
in
no
veiled
fashion
wherever
he
might
be
everything
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
in
the
little
town
not
a
word
was
lost
people
were
already
affronted
by
his
conduct
during
the
past
year
they
had
not
forgotten
the
scandalous
fashion
in
which
he
had
shown
himself
abroad
with
ada
and
the
troublous
times
of
the
sequel
he
had
forgotten
it
himself
one
day
wiped
out
another
and
he
was
very
different
from
what
he
had
been
two
months
before
but
others
had
not
forgotten
those
who
in
all
small
towns
take
upon
themselves
scrupulously
to
note
down
all
the
faults
all
the
imperfections
all
the
sad
ugly
and
unpleasant
happenings
concerning
their
neighbors
so
that
nothing
is
ever
forgotten
new
extravagances
were
naturally
set
side
by
side
with
his
former
indiscretions
in
the
scroll
the
former
explained
the
latter
the
outraged
feelings
of
offended
morality
were
now
bolstered
up
by
those
of
scandalized
good
taste
the
kindliest
of
them
said
he
is
trying
to
be
particular
but
most
alleged
total
verrückt
absolutely
mad
an
opinion
no
less
severe
and
even
more
dangerous
was
beginning
to
find
currency
an
opinion
assured
of
success
by
reason
of
its
illustrious
origin
it
was
said
that
at
the
palace
whither
christophe
still
went
upon
his
official
duties
he
had
had
the
bad
taste
in
conversation
with
the
grand
duke
himself
with
revolting
lack
of
decency
to
give
vent
to
his
ideas
concerning
the
illustrious
masters
it
was
said
that
he
had
called
mendelssohn
a
clerical
humbug
paternoster
and
he
had
called
certain
of
schumann
and
that
in
the
face
of
the
declared
preference
of
the
august
princess
for
those
works
the
grand
duke
had
cut
short
his
impertinences
by
saying
dryly
to
hear
you
sir
one
would
doubt
your
being
a
german
this
vengeful
utterance
coming
from
so
lofty
an
eminence
reached
the
lowest
depths
and
everybody
who
thought
he
had
reason
to
be
annoyed
with
christophe
either
for
his
success
or
for
some
more
personal
if
not
more
cogent
reason
did
not
fail
to
call
to
mind
that
he
was
not
in
fact
pure
german
his
family
it
was
remembered
came
originally
from
belgium
it
was
not
surprising
therefore
that
this
immigrant
should
decry
the
national
glories
that
explained
everything
and
german
vanity
found
reasons
therein
for
greater
and
at
the
same
time
for
despising
its
adversary
christophe
himself
most
substantially
fed
this
platonic
vengeance
it
is
very
imprudent
to
criticise
others
when
you
are
yourself
on
the
point
of
challenging
criticism
a
cleverer
or
less
frank
artist
would
have
shown
more
modesty
and
more
respect
for
his
predecessors
but
christophe
could
see
no
reason
for
hiding
his
contempt
for
mediocrity
or
his
joy
in
his
own
strength
and
his
joy
was
shown
in
no
temperate
fashion
although
from
childhood
christophe
had
been
turned
in
upon
himself
for
want
of
any
creature
to
confide
in
of
late
he
had
come
by
a
need
of
expansiveness
he
had
too
much
joy
for
himself
his
breast
was
too
small
to
contain
it
he
would
have
burst
if
he
had
not
shared
his
delight
failing
a
friend
he
had
confided
in
his
colleague
in
the
orchestra
the
second
siegmund
ochs
a
young
wurtemberger
a
good
fellow
though
crafty
who
showed
him
an
effusive
deference
christophe
did
not
distrust
him
and
even
if
he
had
how
could
it
have
occurred
to
him
that
it
might
be
harmful
to
confide
his
joy
to
one
who
did
not
care
or
even
to
an
enemy
ought
they
not
rather
to
be
grateful
to
him
was
it
not
for
them
also
that
he
was
working
he
brought
happiness
for
all
friends
and
enemies
he
had
no
idea
that
there
is
nothing
more
difficult
than
to
make
men
accept
a
new
happiness
they
almost
prefer
their
old
misery
they
need
food
that
has
been
masticated
for
ages
but
what
is
most
intolerable
to
them
is
the
thought
that
they
owe
such
happiness
to
another
they
can
not
forgive
that
offense
until
there
is
no
way
of
evading
it
and
in
any
case
they
do
contrive
to
make
the
giver
pay
dearly
for
it
there
were
then
a
thousand
reasons
why
christophe
confidences
should
not
be
kindly
received
by
anybody
but
there
were
a
thousand
and
one
reasons
why
they
should
not
be
acceptable
to
siegmund
ochs
the
first
tobias
pfeiffer
was
on
the
point
of
retiring
and
in
spite
of
his
youth
christophe
had
every
chance
of
succeeding
him
ochs
was
too
good
a
german
not
to
recognize
that
christophe
was
worthy
of
the
position
since
the
court
was
on
his
side
but
he
had
too
good
an
opinion
of
himself
not
to
believe
that
he
would
have
been
more
worthy
had
the
court
known
him
better
and
so
he
received
christophe
effusions
with
a
strange
smile
when
he
arrived
at
the
theater
in
the
morning
with
a
face
that
he
tried
hard
to
make
serious
though
it
beamed
in
spite
of
himself
well
he
would
say
slyly
as
he
came
up
to
him
another
masterpiece
christophe
would
take
his
arm
ah
my
friend
it
is
the
best
of
all
if
you
could
hear
it
devil
take
me
it
is
too
beautiful
there
has
never
been
anything
like
it
god
help
the
poor
audience
they
will
only
long
for
one
thing
when
they
have
heard
it
to
die
his
words
did
not
fall
upon
deaf
ears
instead
of
smiling
or
of
chaffing
christophe
about
his
childish
enthusiasm
he
would
have
been
the
first
to
laugh
at
it
and
beg
pardon
if
he
had
been
made
to
feel
the
absurdity
of
it
ochs
went
into
ironic
ecstasies
he
drew
christophe
on
to
further
enormities
and
when
he
left
him
made
haste
to
repeat
them
all
making
them
even
more
grotesque
the
little
circle
of
musicians
chuckled
over
them
and
every
one
was
impatient
for
the
opportunity
of
judging
the
unhappy
they
were
all
judged
beforehand
at
last
they
appeared
christophe
had
chosen
from
the
better
of
his
works
an
overture
to
the
of
hebbel
the
savage
energy
of
which
had
attracted
him
in
his
reaction
against
german
atony
although
he
was
beginning
to
lose
his
taste
for
it
knowing
intuitively
the
unnaturalness
of
such
assumption
of
genius
always
and
at
all
costs
he
had
added
a
symphony
which
bore
the
bombastic
title
of
the
basle
boecklin
dream
of
and
the
motto
somnium
a
completed
the
programme
with
a
few
classical
works
and
a
by
ochs
which
christophe
had
kindly
offered
to
include
in
his
concert
though
he
knew
it
to
be
mediocre
nothing
much
happened
during
the
rehearsals
although
the
orchestra
understood
absolutely
nothing
of
the
composition
it
was
playing
and
everybody
was
privately
disconcerted
by
the
oddities
of
the
new
music
they
had
no
time
to
form
an
opinion
they
were
not
capable
of
doing
so
until
the
public
had
pronounced
on
it
besides
christophe
confidence
imposed
on
the
artists
who
like
every
good
german
orchestra
were
docile
and
disciplined
his
only
difficulties
were
with
the
singer
she
was
the
blue
lady
of
the
concert
she
was
famous
through
germany
the
domestic
creature
sang
brünnhilde
kundry
at
dresden
and
bayreuth
with
undoubted
but
if
in
the
wagnerian
school
she
had
learned
the
art
of
which
that
school
is
justly
proud
the
art
of
good
articulation
of
projecting
the
consonants
through
space
and
of
battering
the
gaping
audience
with
the
vowels
as
with
a
club
she
had
not
learned
designedly
the
art
of
being
natural
she
provided
for
every
word
everything
was
accentuated
the
syllables
moved
with
leaden
feet
and
there
was
a
tragedy
in
every
sentence
christophe
implored
her
to
moderate
her
dramatic
power
a
little
she
tried
at
first
graciously
enough
but
her
natural
heaviness
and
her
need
for
letting
her
voice
go
carried
her
away
christophe
became
nervous
he
told
the
respectable
lady
that
he
had
tried
to
make
human
beings
speak
with
his
and
not
the
dragon
fafner
she
took
his
insolence
in
bad
part
naturally
she
said
that
thank
heaven
she
knew
what
singing
was
and
that
she
had
had
the
honor
of
interpreting
the
of
maestro
brahms
in
the
presence
of
that
great
man
and
that
he
had
never
tired
of
hearing
her
so
much
the
worse
so
much
the
worse
cried
christophe
she
asked
him
with
a
haughty
smile
to
be
kind
enough
to
explain
the
meaning
of
his
energetic
remark
he
replied
that
never
in
his
life
had
brahms
known
what
it
was
to
be
natural
that
his
eulogies
were
the
worst
possible
censure
and
that
although
he
christophe
was
not
very
polite
as
she
had
justly
observed
never
would
he
have
gone
so
far
as
to
say
anything
so
unpleasant
the
argument
went
on
in
this
fashion
and
the
lady
insisted
on
singing
in
her
own
way
with
heavy
pathos
and
melodramatic
effects
until
one
day
when
christophe
declared
coldly
that
he
saw
the
truth
it
was
her
nature
and
nothing
could
change
it
but
since
the
could
not
be
sung
properly
they
should
not
be
sung
at
all
he
withdrew
them
from
the
it
was
on
the
eve
of
the
concert
and
they
were
counting
on
the
she
had
talked
about
them
she
was
musician
enough
to
appreciate
certain
of
their
qualities
christophe
insulted
her
and
as
she
was
not
sure
that
the
morrow
concert
would
not
set
the
seal
on
the
young
man
fame
she
did
not
wish
to
quarrel
with
a
rising
star
she
gave
way
suddenly
and
during
the
last
rehearsal
she
submitted
docilely
to
all
christophe
wishes
but
she
had
made
up
her
mind
at
the
concert
to
have
her
own
way
the
day
came
christophe
had
no
anxiety
he
was
too
full
of
his
music
to
be
able
to
judge
it
he
realized
that
some
of
his
works
in
certain
places
bordered
on
the
ridiculous
but
what
did
that
matter
nothing
great
can
be
written
without
touching
the
ridiculous
to
reach
the
heart
of
things
it
is
necessary
to
dare
human
respect
politeness
modesty
the
timidity
of
social
lies
under
which
the
heart
is
stifled
if
nobody
is
to
be
affronted
and
success
attained
a
man
must
be
resigned
all
his
life
to
remain
bound
by
convention
and
to
give
to
people
the
truth
mitigated
diluted
which
they
are
capable
of
receiving
he
must
dwell
in
prison
all
his
life
a
man
is
great
only
when
he
has
set
his
foot
on
such
anxieties
christophe
trampled
them
underfoot
let
them
hiss
him
he
was
sure
of
not
leaving
them
indifferent
he
conjured
up
the
faces
that
certain
people
of
his
acquaintance
would
make
as
they
heard
certain
rather
bold
passages
he
expected
bitter
criticism
he
smiled
at
it
already
in
any
case
they
would
have
to
be
blind
or
deaf
to
deny
that
there
was
force
in
it
pleasant
or
otherwise
what
did
it
matter
pleasant
pleasant
force
that
is
enough
let
it
go
its
way
and
bear
all
before
it
like
the
rhine
he
had
one
setback
the
grand
duke
did
not
come
the
royal
box
was
only
occupied
by
court
people
a
few
christophe
was
irritated
by
it
he
thought
the
fool
is
cross
with
me
he
does
not
know
what
to
think
of
my
work
he
is
afraid
of
compromising
himself
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
pretending
not
to
be
put
out
by
such
idiocy
others
paid
more
attention
to
it
it
was
the
first
lesson
for
him
a
menace
of
his
future
the
public
had
not
shown
much
more
interest
than
the
grand
duke
quite
a
third
of
the
hall
was
empty
christophe
could
not
help
thinking
bitterly
of
the
crowded
halls
at
his
concerts
when
he
was
a
child
he
would
not
have
been
surprised
by
the
change
if
he
had
had
more
experience
it
would
have
seemed
natural
to
him
that
there
were
fewer
people
come
to
hear
him
when
he
made
good
music
than
when
he
made
bad
for
it
is
not
music
but
the
musician
in
which
the
greater
part
of
the
public
is
interested
and
it
is
obvious
that
a
musician
who
is
a
man
and
like
everybody
else
is
much
less
interesting
than
a
musician
in
a
child
little
trowsers
or
short
frock
who
tickles
sentimentality
or
amuses
idleness
after
waiting
in
vain
for
the
hall
to
fill
christophe
decided
to
begin
he
tried
to
pretend
that
it
was
better
so
saying
a
few
friends
but
good
his
optimism
did
not
last
long
his
pieces
were
played
in
there
is
a
silence
in
an
audience
which
seems
big
and
overflowing
with
love
but
there
was
nothing
in
this
nothing
utter
sleep
blankness
every
phrase
seemed
to
drop
into
depths
of
indifference
with
his
back
turned
to
the
audience
busy
with
his
orchestra
christophe
was
fully
aware
of
everything
that
was
happening
in
the
hall
with
those
inner
antennæ
which
every
true
musician
is
endowed
so
that
he
knows
whether
what
he
is
playing
is
waking
an
echo
in
the
hearts
about
him
he
went
on
conducting
and
growing
excited
while
he
was
frozen
by
the
cold
mist
of
boredom
rising
from
the
stalls
and
the
boxes
behind
him
at
last
the
overture
was
ended
and
the
audience
applauded
it
applauded
coldly
politely
and
was
then
silent
christophe
would
rather
have
had
them
hoot
a
hiss
one
hiss
anything
to
give
a
sign
of
life
or
at
least
of
reaction
against
his
work
he
looked
at
the
audience
the
people
were
looking
at
each
other
each
trying
to
find
out
what
the
other
thought
they
did
not
succeed
and
relapsed
into
indifference
the
music
went
on
the
symphony
was
christophe
found
it
hard
to
go
on
to
the
end
several
times
he
was
on
the
point
of
throwing
down
his
baton
and
running
away
their
apathy
overtook
him
at
last
he
could
not
understand
what
he
was
conducting
he
could
not
breathe
he
felt
that
he
was
falling
into
fathomless
boredom
there
was
not
even
the
whispered
ironic
comment
which
he
had
anticipated
at
certain
passages
the
audience
were
reading
their
programmes
christophe
heard
the
pages
turned
all
together
with
a
dry
rustling
and
then
once
more
there
was
silence
until
the
last
chord
when
the
same
polite
applause
showed
that
they
had
not
understood
that
the
symphony
was
and
yet
there
were
four
pairs
of
hands
went
on
clapping
when
the
others
had
finished
but
they
awoke
no
echo
and
stopped
ashamed
that
made
the
emptiness
seem
more
empty
and
the
little
incident
served
to
show
the
audience
how
bored
it
had
been
christophe
took
a
seat
in
the
middle
of
the
orchestra
he
dared
not
look
to
right
or
left
he
wanted
to
cry
and
at
the
same
time
he
was
quivering
with
rage
he
was
fain
to
get
up
and
shout
at
them
you
bore
me
ah
how
you
bore
me
i
can
not
bear
it
go
away
go
away
all
of
you
the
audience
woke
up
a
little
they
were
expecting
the
singer
they
were
accustomed
to
applauding
her
in
that
ocean
of
new
music
in
which
they
were
drifting
without
a
compass
she
at
least
was
sure
a
known
land
and
a
solid
in
which
there
was
no
danger
of
being
lost
christophe
divined
their
thoughts
exactly
and
he
laughed
bitterly
the
singer
was
no
less
conscious
of
the
expectancy
of
the
audience
christophe
saw
that
in
her
regal
airs
when
he
came
and
told
her
that
it
was
her
turn
to
appear
they
looked
at
each
other
inimically
instead
of
offering
her
his
arm
christophe
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
let
her
go
on
alone
furious
and
out
of
countenance
she
passed
him
he
followed
her
with
a
bored
expression
as
soon
as
she
appeared
the
audience
gave
her
an
ovation
that
made
everybody
happier
every
face
brightened
the
audience
grew
interested
and
glasses
were
brought
into
play
certain
of
her
power
she
tackled
the
in
her
own
way
of
course
and
absolutely
disregarded
christophe
remarks
of
the
evening
before
christophe
who
was
accompanying
her
went
pale
he
had
foreseen
her
rebellion
at
the
first
change
that
she
made
he
tapped
on
the
piano
and
said
angrily
no
she
went
on
he
whispered
behind
her
back
in
a
low
voice
of
fury
no
no
not
like
that
not
that
unnerved
by
his
fierce
growls
which
the
audience
could
not
hear
though
the
orchestra
caught
every
syllable
she
stuck
to
it
dragging
her
notes
making
pauses
like
organ
stops
he
paid
no
heed
to
them
and
went
ahead
in
the
end
they
got
out
of
time
the
audience
did
not
notice
it
for
some
time
they
had
been
saying
that
christophe
music
was
not
made
to
seem
pleasant
or
right
to
the
ear
but
christophe
who
was
not
of
that
opinion
was
making
lunatic
grimaces
and
at
last
he
exploded
he
stopped
short
in
the
middle
of
a
bar
stop
he
shouted
she
was
carried
on
by
her
own
impetus
for
half
a
bar
and
then
stopped
that
enough
he
said
dryly
there
was
a
moment
of
amazement
in
the
audience
after
a
few
seconds
he
said
icily
begin
again
she
looked
at
him
in
stupefaction
her
hands
trembled
she
thought
for
a
moment
of
throwing
his
book
at
his
head
afterwards
she
did
not
understand
how
it
was
that
she
did
not
do
so
but
she
was
overwhelmed
by
authority
and
his
unanswerable
tone
of
voice
she
began
again
she
sang
the
without
changing
one
shade
of
meaning
or
a
single
movement
for
she
felt
that
he
would
spare
her
nothing
and
she
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
a
fresh
insult
when
she
had
finished
the
audience
recalled
her
frantically
they
were
not
applauding
the
they
would
have
applauded
just
the
same
if
she
had
sung
any
others
but
the
famous
singer
who
had
grown
old
in
harness
they
knew
that
they
could
safely
admire
her
besides
they
wanted
to
make
up
to
her
for
the
insult
she
had
just
received
they
were
not
quite
sure
but
they
did
vaguely
understand
that
the
singer
had
made
a
mistake
and
they
thought
it
indecent
of
christophe
to
call
their
attention
to
it
they
encored
the
songs
but
christophe
shut
the
piano
firmly
the
singer
did
not
notice
his
insolence
she
was
too
much
upset
to
think
of
singing
again
she
left
the
stage
hurriedly
and
shut
herself
up
in
her
box
and
then
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
relieved
her
heart
of
the
flood
of
wrath
and
rage
that
was
pent
up
in
it
a
nervous
attack
a
deluge
of
tears
indignant
outcries
and
imprecations
against
christophe
she
omitted
nothing
her
cries
of
anger
could
be
heard
through
the
closed
door
those
of
her
friends
who
had
made
their
way
there
told
everybody
when
they
left
that
christophe
had
behaved
like
a
cad
opinion
travels
quickly
in
a
concert
hall
and
so
when
christophe
went
to
his
desk
for
the
last
piece
of
music
the
audience
was
stormy
but
it
was
not
his
composition
it
was
the
by
ochs
which
christophe
had
kindly
included
in
his
programme
the
audience
who
were
quite
at
their
ease
with
the
dull
music
found
a
very
simple
method
of
displaying
their
disapproval
of
christophe
without
going
so
far
as
to
hiss
him
they
acclaimed
ochs
ostentatiously
recalled
the
composer
two
or
three
times
and
he
appeared
readily
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
concert
the
grand
duke
and
everybody
at
the
court
the
bored
gossiping
little
provincial
town
lost
no
detail
of
what
had
happened
the
papers
which
were
friendly
towards
the
singer
made
no
allusion
to
the
incident
but
they
all
agreed
in
exalting
her
art
while
they
only
mentioned
the
titles
of
the
which
she
had
sung
they
published
only
a
few
lines
about
christophe
other
compositions
and
they
all
said
almost
the
same
things
knowledge
of
counterpoint
complicated
writing
lack
of
inspiration
no
melody
written
with
the
head
not
with
the
heart
want
of
sincerity
trying
to
be
original

a
paragraph
on
true
originality
that
of
the
masters
who
are
dead
and
buried
mozart
beethoven
loewe
schubert
brahms
those
who
are
original
without
thinking
of
it
then
by
a
natural
transition
they
passed
to
the
revival
at
the
grand
ducal
theater
of
the
von
of
konradin
kreutzer
a
long
account
was
given
of
the
delicious
music
as
fresh
and
jolly
as
when
it
was
first
written
christophe
compositions
met
with
absolute
and
astonished
lack
of
comprehension
from
the
most
kindly
disposed
critics
veiled
hostility
from
those
who
did
not
like
him
and
were
arming
themselves
for
later
ventures
and
from
the
general
public
guided
by
neither
friendly
nor
hostile
critics
silence
left
to
its
own
thoughts
the
general
public
does
not
think
at
all
that
goes
without
saying
christophe
was
bowled
over
and
yet
there
was
nothing
surprising
in
his
defeat
there
were
reasons
three
to
one
why
his
compositions
should
not
please
they
were
immature
they
were
secondly
too
advanced
to
be
understood
at
once
and
lastly
people
were
only
too
glad
to
give
a
lesson
to
the
impertinent
but
christophe
was
not
enough
to
admit
that
his
reverse
was
legitimate
he
had
none
of
that
serenity
which
the
true
artist
gains
from
the
mournful
experience
of
long
misunderstanding
at
the
hands
of
men
and
their
incurable
stupidity
his
naïve
confidence
in
the
public
and
in
success
which
he
thought
he
could
easily
gain
because
he
deserved
it
crumbled
away
he
would
have
thought
it
natural
to
have
enemies
but
what
staggered
him
was
to
find
that
he
had
not
a
single
friend
those
on
whom
he
had
counted
those
who
hitherto
had
seemed
to
be
interested
in
everything
that
he
wrote
had
not
given
him
a
single
word
of
encouragement
since
the
concert
he
tried
to
probe
them
they
took
refuge
behind
vague
words
he
insisted
he
wanted
to
know
what
they
really
thought
the
most
sincere
of
them
referred
back
to
his
former
works
his
foolish
early
more
than
once
in
his
life
he
was
to
hear
his
new
works
condemned
by
comparison
with
the
older
ones
and
that
by
the
same
people
who
a
few
years
before
had
condemned
his
older
works
when
they
were
new
that
is
the
usual
ordering
of
these
things
christophe
did
not
like
it
he
exclaimed
loudly
if
people
did
not
like
him
well
and
good
he
accepted
that
it
even
pleased
him
since
he
could
not
be
friends
with
everybody
but
that
people
should
pretend
to
be
fond
of
him
and
not
allow
him
to
grow
up
that
they
should
try
to
force
him
all
his
life
to
remain
a
child
was
beyond
the
pale
what
is
good
at
twelve
is
not
good
at
twenty
and
he
hoped
not
to
stay
at
that
but
to
change
and
to
go
on
changing
always
these
idiots
who
tried
to
stop
life
what
was
interesting
in
his
childish
compositions
was
not
their
childishness
and
silliness
but
the
force
in
them
hungering
for
the
future
and
they
were
trying
to
kill
his
future
no
they
had
never
understood
what
he
was
they
had
never
loved
him
never
then
or
now
they
only
loved
the
weakness
and
vulgarity
in
him
everything
that
he
had
in
common
with
others
and
not
not
what
he
really
was
their
friendship
was
a
misunderstanding
he
was
exaggerating
perhaps
it
often
happens
with
quite
nice
people
who
are
incapable
of
liking
new
work
which
they
sincerely
love
when
it
is
twenty
years
old
new
life
smacks
too
strong
for
their
weak
senses
the
scent
of
it
must
evaporate
in
the
winds
of
time
a
work
of
art
only
becomes
intelligible
to
them
when
it
is
crusted
over
with
the
dust
of
years
but
christophe
could
not
admit
of
not
being
understood
when
he
was
and
of
being
understood
when
he
was
he
preferred
to
think
that
he
was
not
understood
at
all
in
any
case
even
and
he
raged
against
it
he
was
foolish
enough
to
want
to
make
himself
understood
to
explain
himself
to
argue
although
no
good
purpose
was
served
thereby
he
would
have
had
to
reform
the
taste
of
his
time
but
he
was
afraid
of
nothing
he
was
determined
by
hook
or
by
crook
to
clean
up
german
taste
but
it
was
utterly
impossible
he
could
not
convince
anybody
by
means
of
conversation
in
which
he
found
it
difficult
to
find
words
and
expressed
himself
with
an
excess
of
violence
about
the
great
musicians
and
even
about
the
men
to
whom
he
was
talking
he
only
succeeded
in
making
a
few
more
enemies
he
would
have
had
to
prepare
his
ideas
beforehand
and
then
to
force
the
public
to
hear
him
and
just
then
at
the
appointed
hour
his
star
his
evil
star
gave
him
the
means
of
doing
so
he
was
sitting
in
the
restaurant
of
the
theater
in
a
group
of
musicians
belonging
to
the
orchestra
whom
he
was
scandalizing
by
his
artistic
judgments
they
were
not
all
of
the
same
opinion
but
they
were
all
ruffled
by
the
freedom
of
his
language
old
krause
the
alto
a
good
fellow
and
a
good
musician
who
sincerely
loved
christophe
tried
to
turn
the
conversation
he
coughed
then
looked
out
for
an
opportunity
of
making
a
pun
but
christophe
did
not
hear
him
he
went
on
and
krause
mourned
and
thought
what
makes
him
say
such
things
god
bless
him
you
can
think
these
things
but
you
must
not
say
them
the
odd
thing
was
that
he
also
thought
these
things
at
least
he
had
a
glimmering
of
them
and
christophe
words
roused
many
doubts
in
him
but
he
had
not
the
courage
to
confess
it
or
openly
to
agree
half
from
fear
of
compromising
himself
half
from
modesty
and
distrust
of
himself
weigl
the
did
not
want
to
know
anything
he
was
ready
to
admire
anything
or
anybody
good
or
bad
star
or
everything
was
the
same
to
him
there
were
no
degrees
in
his
admiration
he
admired
admired
admired
it
was
a
vital
necessity
to
him
it
hurt
him
when
anybody
tried
to
curb
him
old
kuh
the
violoncellist
suffered
even
more
he
loved
bad
music
with
all
his
heart
everything
that
christophe
hounded
down
with
his
sarcasm
and
invective
was
infinitely
dear
to
him
instinctively
his
choice
pitched
on
the
most
conventional
works
his
soul
was
a
reservoir
of
tearful
and
emotion
indeed
he
was
not
dishonest
in
his
tender
regard
for
all
the
sham
great
men
it
was
when
he
tried
to
pretend
that
he
liked
the
real
great
men
that
he
was
lying
to
himself
in
perfect
innocence
there
are
brahmins
who
think
to
find
in
their
god
the
breath
of
old
men
of
genius
they
love
beethoven
in
brahms
kuh
went
one
better
he
loved
brahms
in
beethoven
but
the
most
enraged
of
all
with
christophe
paradoxes
was
spitz
the
bassoon
it
was
not
so
much
his
musical
instinct
that
was
wounded
as
his
natural
servility
one
of
the
roman
emperors
wished
to
die
standing
spitz
wished
to
die
as
he
had
lived
crawling
that
was
his
natural
position
it
was
delightful
to
him
to
grovel
at
the
feet
of
everything
that
was
official
hallowed
arrived
and
he
was
beside
himself
when
anybody
tried
to
keep
him
from
playing
the
lackey
comfortably
so
kuh
groaned
weigl
threw
up
his
hands
in
despair
krause
made
jokes
and
spitz
shouted
in
a
shrill
voice
but
christophe
went
on
imperturbably
shouting
louder
than
the
rest
and
saying
monstrous
things
about
germany
and
the
germans
at
the
next
table
a
young
man
was
listening
to
him
and
rocking
with
laughter
he
had
black
curly
hair
fine
intelligent
eyes
a
large
nose
which
at
its
end
could
not
make
up
its
mind
to
go
either
to
right
or
left
and
rather
than
go
straight
on
went
to
both
sides
at
once
thick
lips
and
a
clever
mobile
face
he
was
following
everything
that
christophe
said
hanging
on
his
lips
reflecting
every
word
with
a
sympathetic
and
yet
mocking
attention
wrinkling
up
his
forehead
his
temples
the
corners
of
his
eyes
round
his
nostrils
and
cheeks
grimacing
with
laughter
and
every
now
and
then
shaking
all
over
convulsively
he
did
not
join
in
the
conversation
but
he
did
not
miss
a
word
of
it
he
showed
his
joy
especially
when
he
saw
christophe
involved
in
some
argument
and
heckled
by
spitz
flounder
about
stammer
and
stutter
with
anger
until
he
had
found
the
word
he
was
seeking
a
rock
with
which
to
crush
his
adversary
and
his
delight
knew
no
bounds
when
christophe
swept
along
by
his
passions
far
beyond
the
capacity
of
his
thought
enunciated
monstrous
paradoxes
which
made
his
hearers
snort
at
last
they
broke
up
each
of
them
tired
out
with
feeling
and
alleging
his
own
superiority
as
christophe
the
last
to
go
was
leaving
the
room
he
was
accosted
by
the
young
man
who
had
listened
to
his
words
with
such
pleasure
he
had
not
yet
noticed
him
the
other
politely
removed
his
hat
smiled
and
asked
permission
to
introduce
himself
franz
mannheim
he
begged
pardon
for
his
indiscretion
in
listening
to
the
argument
and
congratulated
christophe
on
the
with
which
he
had
pulverized
his
opponents
he
was
still
laughing
at
the
thought
of
it
christophe
was
glad
to
hear
it
and
looked
at
him
a
little
distrustfully
seriously
he
asked
you
are
not
laughing
at
me
the
other
swore
by
the
gods
christophe
face
lit
up
then
you
think
i
am
right
you
are
of
my
opinion
well
said
mannheim
i
am
not
a
musician
i
know
nothing
of
music
the
only
music
i
like
if
it
is
not
too
flattering
to
say
so
is
yours
that
may
show
you
that
my
taste
is
not
so
bad
oh
said
christophe
skeptically
though
he
was
flattered
all
the
same
that
proves
nothing
you
are
difficult
to
please
good
i
think
as
you
do
that
proves
nothing
and
i
do
venture
to
judge
what
you
say
of
german
musicians
but
anyhow
it
is
so
true
of
the
germans
in
general
the
old
germans
all
the
romantic
idiots
with
their
rancid
thought
their
sloppy
emotion
their
senile
reiteration
which
we
are
asked
to
admire
eternal
yesterday
which
has
always
been
and
always
will
be
and
will
be
law
because
it
is
law
he
recited
a
few
lines
of
the
famous
passage
in
schiller
ewig
gestrige
das
immer
war
imd
immer
himself
first
of
all
he
stopped
in
the
middle
of
his
recitation
who
asked
christophe
the
who
wrote
that
christophe
did
not
understand
but
mannheim
went
on
i
should
like
to
have
a
general
cleaning
up
of
art
and
thought
every
fifty
years
nothing
to
be
left
standing
a
little
drastic
said
christophe
smiling
no
i
assure
you
fifty
years
is
too
much
i
should
say
thirty
and
even
less
it
is
a
hygienic
measure
one
does
not
keep
one
ancestors
in
one
house
one
gets
rid
of
them
when
they
are
dead
and
sends
them
elsewhere
there
politely
to
rot
and
one
places
stones
on
them
to
be
quite
sure
that
they
will
not
come
back
nice
people
put
flowers
on
them
too
i
do
mind
if
they
like
it
all
i
ask
is
to
be
left
in
peace
i
leave
them
alone
each
for
his
own
side
say
i
the
dead
and
the
living
there
are
some
dead
who
are
more
alive
than
the
living
no
no
it
would
be
more
true
to
say
that
there
are
some
living
who
are
more
dead
than
the
dead
maybe
in
any
case
there
are
old
things
which
are
still
young
then
if
they
are
still
young
we
can
find
them
for
ourselves
but
i
do
believe
it
what
has
been
good
once
never
is
good
again
nothing
is
good
but
change
before
all
we
have
to
rid
ourselves
of
the
old
men
and
things
there
are
too
many
of
them
in
germany
death
to
them
say
i
christophe
listened
to
these
squibs
attentively
and
labored
to
discuss
them
he
was
in
part
in
sympathy
with
them
he
recognized
certain
of
his
own
thoughts
in
them
and
at
the
same
time
he
felt
a
little
embarrassed
at
having
them
so
blown
out
to
the
point
of
caricature
but
as
he
assumed
that
everybody
else
was
as
serious
as
himself
he
thought
that
perhaps
mannheim
who
seemed
to
be
more
learned
than
himself
and
spoke
more
easily
was
right
and
was
drawing
the
logical
conclusions
from
his
principles
vain
christophe
whom
so
many
people
could
not
forgive
for
his
faith
in
himself
was
really
most
naïvely
modest
often
tricked
by
his
modesty
when
he
was
with
those
who
were
better
educated
than
himself
especially
when
they
consented
not
to
plume
themselves
on
it
to
avoid
an
awkward
discussion
mannheim
who
was
amusing
himself
with
his
own
paradoxes
and
from
one
sally
to
another
had
reached
extravagant
quips
and
cranks
at
which
he
was
laughing
immensely
was
not
accustomed
to
being
taken
seriously
he
was
delighted
with
the
trouble
that
christophe
was
taking
to
discuss
his
nonsense
and
even
to
understand
it
and
while
he
laughed
he
was
grateful
for
the
importance
which
christophe
gave
him
he
thought
him
absurd
and
charming
they
parted
very
good
friends
and
christophe
was
not
a
little
surprised
three
hours
later
at
rehearsal
to
see
mannheim
head
poked
through
the
little
door
leading
to
the
orchestra
smiling
and
grimacing
and
making
mysterious
signs
at
him
when
the
rehearsal
was
over
christophe
went
to
him
mannheim
took
his
arm
familiarly
you
can
spare
a
moment
listen
i
have
an
idea
perhaps
you
will
think
it
absurd
would
not
you
like
for
once
in
a
way
to
write
what
you
think
of
music
and
the
musicos
instead
of
wasting
your
breath
in
haranguing
four
dirty
knaves
of
your
band
who
are
good
for
nothing
but
scraping
and
blowing
into
bits
of
wood
would
it
not
be
better
to
address
the
general
public
not
better
would
i
like
my
word
and
when
do
you
want
me
to
write
it
is
good
of
you
i
a
proposal
for
you
some
friends
and
i
adalbert
von
waldhaus
raphael
goldenring
adolf
mai
and
lucien
ehrenfeld
have
started
a
review
the
only
intelligent
review
in
the
town
the
you
must
know
it
we
all
admire
each
other
and
should
be
glad
if
you
would
join
us
will
you
take
over
our
musical
criticism
christophe
was
abashed
by
such
an
honor
he
was
longing
to
accept
he
was
only
afraid
of
not
being
worthy
he
could
not
write
oh
come
said
mannheim
i
am
sure
you
can
and
besides
as
soon
as
you
are
a
critic
you
can
do
anything
you
like
you
no
need
to
be
afraid
of
the
public
the
public
is
incredibly
stupid
it
is
nothing
to
be
an
artist
an
artist
is
only
a
sort
of
comedian
an
artist
can
be
hissed
but
a
critic
has
the
right
to
say
me
that
man
the
whole
audience
lets
him
do
its
thinking
think
whatever
you
like
only
look
as
if
you
were
thinking
something
provided
you
give
the
fools
their
food
it
does
not
much
matter
what
they
will
gulp
down
anything
in
the
end
christophe
consented
with
effusive
thanks
he
only
made
it
a
condition
that
he
should
be
allowed
to
say
what
he
liked
of
course
of
course
said
mannheim
absolute
freedom
we
are
all
free
he
looked
him
up
at
the
theater
once
more
after
the
performance
to
introduce
him
to
adalbert
von
waldhaus
and
his
friends
they
welcomed
him
warmly
with
the
exception
of
waldhaus
who
belonged
to
one
of
the
noble
families
of
the
neighborhood
they
were
all
jews
and
all
very
rich
mannheim
was
the
son
of
a
banker
mai
the
son
of
the
manager
of
a
metallurgical
establishment
and
ehrenfeld
father
was
a
great
jeweler
their
fathers
belonged
to
the
older
generation
of
jews
industrious
and
acquisitive
attached
to
the
spirit
of
their
race
building
their
fortunes
with
keen
energy
and
enjoying
their
energy
much
more
than
their
fortunes
their
sons
seemed
to
be
made
to
destroy
what
their
fathers
had
builded
they
laughed
at
family
prejudice
and
their
mania
for
economy
and
delving
they
posed
as
artists
affected
to
despise
money
and
to
fling
it
out
of
window
but
in
reality
they
hardly
ever
let
it
slip
through
their
fingers
and
in
vain
did
they
do
all
sorts
of
foolish
things
they
never
could
altogether
lead
astray
their
lucidity
of
mind
and
practical
sense
for
the
rest
their
parents
kept
an
eye
on
them
and
reined
them
in
the
most
prodigal
of
them
mannheim
would
sincerely
have
given
away
all
that
he
had
but
he
never
had
anything
and
although
he
was
always
loudly
inveighing
against
his
niggardliness
in
his
heart
he
laughed
at
it
and
thought
that
he
was
right
in
fine
there
was
only
waldhaus
really
who
was
in
control
of
his
fortune
and
went
into
it
wholeheartedly
and
reckless
of
cost
and
bore
that
of
the
review
he
was
a
poet
he
wrote
in
the
manner
of
arno
holz
and
walt
whitman
with
lines
alternately
very
long
and
very
short
in
which
stops
double
and
triple
stops
dashes
silences
commas
italics
and
italics
played
a
great
part
and
so
did
alliteration
and
repetition
of
a
word
of
a
line
of
a
whole
phrase
he
interpolated
words
of
every
language
he
wanted
no
one
has
ever
known
why
to
render
the
into
verse
in
truth
he
was
poetic
enough
and
had
a
distinguished
taste
for
stale
things
he
was
sentimental
and
dry
naïve
and
foppish
his
labored
verses
affected
a
cavalier
carelessness
he
would
have
been
a
good
poet
for
men
of
the
world
but
there
are
too
many
of
the
kind
in
the
reviews
and
artistic
circles
and
he
wished
to
be
alone
he
had
taken
it
into
his
head
to
play
the
great
gentleman
who
is
above
the
prejudices
of
his
caste
he
had
more
prejudices
than
anybody
he
did
not
admit
their
existence
he
took
a
delight
in
surrounding
himself
with
jews
in
the
review
which
he
edited
to
rouse
the
indignation
of
his
family
who
were
very
and
to
prove
his
own
freedom
of
mind
to
himself
with
his
colleagues
he
assumed
a
tone
of
courteous
equality
but
in
his
heart
he
had
a
calm
and
boundless
contempt
for
them
he
was
not
unaware
that
they
were
very
glad
to
make
use
of
his
name
and
money
and
he
let
them
do
so
because
it
pleased
him
to
despise
them
and
they
despised
him
for
letting
them
do
so
for
they
knew
very
well
that
it
served
his
turn
a
fair
exchange
waldhaus
lent
them
his
name
and
fortune
and
they
brought
him
their
talents
their
eye
for
business
and
subscribers
they
were
much
more
intelligent
than
he
not
that
they
had
more
personality
they
had
perhaps
even
less
but
in
the
little
town
they
were
as
the
jews
are
everywhere
and
always
by
the
mere
fact
of
their
difference
of
race
which
for
centuries
has
isolated
them
and
sharpened
their
faculty
for
making
observation
they
were
the
most
advanced
in
mind
the
most
sensible
of
the
absurdity
of
its
moldy
institutions
and
decrepit
thought
only
as
their
character
was
less
free
than
their
intelligence
it
did
not
help
them
while
they
mocked
from
trying
rather
to
turn
those
institutions
and
ideas
to
account
than
to
reform
them
in
spite
of
their
independent
professions
of
faith
they
were
like
the
noble
adalbert
little
provincial
snobs
rich
idle
young
men
of
family
who
dabbled
and
flirted
with
letters
for
the
fun
of
it
they
were
very
glad
to
swagger
about
as
but
they
were
kindly
enough
and
never
slew
anybody
but
a
few
inoffensive
people
or
those
whom
they
thought
could
never
harm
them
they
cared
nothing
for
setting
by
the
ears
a
society
to
which
they
knew
very
well
they
would
one
day
return
and
embrace
all
the
prejudices
which
they
had
combated
and
when
they
did
venture
to
make
a
stir
on
a
little
scandal
or
loudly
to
declare
war
on
some
idol
of
the
day
who
was
beginning
to
totter
they
took
care
never
to
burn
their
boats
in
case
of
danger
they
whatever
then
might
be
the
issue
of
the
campaign
when
it
was
finished
it
was
a
long
time
before
war
would
break
out
again
the
philistines
could
sleep
in
peace
all
that
these
new
wanted
to
do
was
to
make
it
appear
that
they
could
have
been
terrible
if
they
had
so
desired
but
they
did
not
desire
they
preferred
to
be
on
friendly
terms
with
artists
and
to
give
suppers
to
actresses
christophe
was
not
happy
in
such
a
set
they
were
always
talking
of
women
and
horses
and
their
talk
was
not
refined
they
were
stiff
and
formal
adalbert
spoke
in
a
mincing
slow
voice
with
exaggerated
bored
and
boring
politeness
adolf
mai
the
secretary
of
the
review
a
heavy
young
man
always
pretended
to
be
in
the
right
he
laid
down
the
law
never
listened
to
what
anybody
said
seemed
to
despise
the
opinion
of
the
person
he
was
talking
to
and
also
that
person
goldenring
the
art
critic
who
had
a
twitch
and
eyes
perpetually
winking
behind
his
large
spectacles
no
doubt
in
imitation
of
the
painters
whose
society
he
cultivated
wore
long
hair
smoked
in
silence
mumbled
scraps
of
sentences
which
he
never
finished
and
made
vague
gestures
in
the
air
with
his
thumb
ehrenfeld
was
little
bald
and
smiling
had
a
fair
beard
and
a
sensitive
face
a
hooked
nose
and
he
wrote
the
fashions
and
the
society
notes
in
the
review
in
a
silky
voice
he
used
to
talk
obscurely
he
had
a
wit
though
of
a
malignant
and
often
ignoble
all
these
young
millionaires
were
anarchists
of
course
when
a
man
possesses
everything
it
is
the
supreme
luxury
for
him
to
deny
society
for
in
that
way
he
can
evade
his
responsibilities
so
might
a
robber
who
has
just
fleeced
a
traveler
say
to
him
what
are
you
staying
for
get
along
i
have
no
more
use
for
you
of
the
whole
bunch
christophe
was
only
in
sympathy
with
mannheim
he
was
certainly
the
most
lively
of
the
five
he
was
amused
by
everything
that
he
said
and
everything
that
was
said
to
him
stuttering
stammering
blundering
sniggering
talking
nonsense
he
was
incapable
of
following
an
argument
or
of
knowing
exactly
what
he
thought
himself
but
he
was
quite
kindly
bearing
no
malice
having
not
a
spark
of
ambition
in
truth
he
was
not
very
frank
he
was
always
playing
a
part
but
quite
innocently
and
he
never
did
anybody
any
harm
he
espoused
all
sorts
of
strange
utopias
most
often
generous
he
was
too
subtle
and
too
skeptical
to
keep
his
head
even
in
his
enthusiasms
and
he
never
compromised
himself
by
applying
his
theories
but
he
had
to
have
some
hobby
it
was
a
game
to
him
and
he
was
always
changing
from
one
to
another
for
the
time
being
his
craze
was
for
kindness
it
was
not
enough
for
him
to
be
kind
naturally
he
wished
to
be
thought
kind
he
professed
kindness
and
acted
it
out
of
reaction
against
the
hard
dry
activity
of
his
kinsfolk
and
against
german
austerity
militarism
and
philistinism
he
was
a
tolstoyan
a
nirvanian
an
evangelist
a
buddhist
he
was
not
quite
sure
what
an
apostle
of
a
new
morality
that
was
soft
boneless
indulgent
placid
effusively
forgiving
every
sin
especially
the
sins
of
the
flesh
a
morality
which
did
not
conceal
its
predilection
for
those
sins
and
much
less
readily
forgave
the
virtues
a
morality
which
was
only
a
compact
of
pleasure
a
libertine
association
of
mutual
accommodations
which
amused
itself
by
donning
the
halo
of
sanctity
there
was
in
it
a
spice
of
hypocrisy
which
was
a
little
offensive
to
delicate
palates
and
would
have
even
been
frankly
nauseating
if
it
had
taken
itself
seriously
but
it
made
no
pretensions
towards
that
it
merely
amused
itself
his
blackguardly
christianity
was
only
meant
to
serve
until
some
other
hobby
came
along
to
take
its
place
no
matter
what
brute
force
imperialism
laughing
lions
mannheim
was
always
playing
a
part
playing
with
his
whole
heart
he
was
trying
on
all
the
feelings
that
he
did
not
possess
before
becoming
a
good
jew
like
the
rest
and
with
all
the
spirit
of
his
race
he
was
very
sympathetic
and
extremely
irritating
for
some
time
christophe
was
one
of
his
hobbies
mannheim
swore
by
him
he
blew
his
trumpet
everywhere
he
dinned
his
praises
into
the
ears
of
his
family
according
to
him
christophe
was
a
genius
an
extraordinary
man
who
made
strange
music
and
talked
about
it
in
an
astonishing
fashion
a
witty
man
and
a
handsome
fine
lips
magnificent
teeth
he
added
that
christophe
admired
one
evening
he
took
him
home
to
dinner
christophe
found
himself
talking
to
his
new
friend
father
lothair
mannheim
the
banker
and
franz
sister
judith
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
been
in
a
jew
house
although
there
were
many
jews
in
the
little
town
and
although
they
played
an
important
part
in
its
life
by
reason
of
their
wealth
cohesion
and
intelligence
they
lived
a
little
apart
there
were
always
rooted
prejudices
in
the
minds
of
the
people
and
a
secret
hostility
that
was
credulous
and
injurious
against
them
christophe
family
shared
these
prejudices
his
grandfather
did
not
love
jews
but
the
irony
of
fate
had
decreed
that
his
two
best
pupils
should
be
of
the
race
one
had
become
a
composer
the
other
a
famous
for
there
had
been
moments
when
he
was
fain
to
embrace
these
two
good
musicians
and
then
he
would
remember
sadly
that
they
had
crucified
the
lord
and
he
did
not
know
how
to
reconcile
his
two
incompatible
currents
of
feeling
but
in
the
end
he
did
embrace
them
he
was
inclined
to
think
that
the
lord
would
forgive
them
because
of
their
love
for
christophe
father
melchior
who
pretended
to
be
had
had
fewer
scruples
about
taking
money
from
the
jews
and
he
even
thought
it
good
to
do
so
but
he
ridiculed
them
and
despised
as
for
his
mother
she
was
not
sure
that
she
was
not
committing
a
sin
when
she
went
to
cook
for
them
those
whom
she
had
had
to
do
with
were
disdainful
enough
with
her
but
she
had
no
grudge
against
them
she
bore
nobody
any
she
was
filled
with
pity
for
these
unhappy
people
whom
god
had
damned
sometimes
she
would
be
filled
with
compassion
when
she
saw
the
daughter
of
one
of
them
go
by
or
heard
the
merry
laughter
of
their
children
so
pretty
she
is
such
pretty
children
how
dreadful
she
would
think
she
dared
not
say
anything
to
christophe
when
he
told
her
that
he
was
going
to
dine
with
the
mannheims
but
her
heart
sank
she
thought
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
believe
everything
bad
that
was
said
about
the
jews
people
speak
ill
of
everybody
and
that
there
are
honest
people
everywhere
but
that
it
was
better
and
more
proper
to
keep
themselves
to
themselves
the
jews
on
their
side
the
christians
on
theirs
christophe
shared
none
of
these
prejudices
in
his
perpetual
reaction
against
his
surroundings
he
was
rather
attracted
towards
the
different
race
but
he
hardly
knew
them
he
had
only
come
in
contact
with
the
more
vulgar
of
the
jews
little
shopkeepers
the
populace
swarming
in
certain
streets
between
the
rhine
and
the
cathedral
forming
with
the
gregarious
instinct
of
all
human
beings
a
sort
of
little
ghetto
he
had
often
strolled
through
the
neighborhood
catching
sight
of
and
feeling
a
sort
of
sympathy
with
certain
types
of
women
with
hollow
cheeks
and
full
lips
and
wide
a
da
vinci
smile
rather
depraved
while
the
coarse
language
and
shrill
laughter
destroyed
this
harmony
that
was
in
their
faces
when
in
repose
even
in
the
dregs
of
the
people
in
those
creatures
with
their
bestial
faces
their
squat
bodies
those
degenerate
descendants
of
the
most
noble
of
all
peoples
even
in
that
thick
fetid
muddiness
there
were
strange
phosphorescent
gleams
like
dancing
over
a
swamp
marvelous
glances
minds
subtle
and
brilliant
a
subtle
electricity
emanating
from
the
ooze
which
fascinated
and
disturbed
christophe
he
thought
that
hidden
deep
were
fine
souls
struggling
great
hearts
striving
to
break
free
from
the
dung
and
he
would
have
liked
to
meet
them
and
to
aid
them
without
knowing
them
he
loved
them
while
he
was
a
little
fearful
of
them
and
he
had
never
had
any
opportunity
of
meeting
the
best
of
the
jews
his
dinner
at
the
mannheims
had
for
him
the
attraction
of
novelty
and
something
of
that
of
forbidden
fruit
the
eve
who
gave
him
the
fruit
sweetened
its
flavor
from
the
first
moment
christophe
had
eyes
only
for
judith
mannheim
she
was
utterly
different
from
all
the
women
he
had
known
tall
and
slender
rather
thin
though
solidly
built
with
her
face
framed
in
her
black
hair
not
long
but
thick
and
curled
low
on
her
head
covering
her
temples
and
her
broad
golden
brow
rather
with
large
pupils
and
slightly
prominent
eyes
with
a
largish
nose
and
wide
nostrils
thin
cheeks
a
heavy
chin
strong
coloring
she
had
a
fine
profile
showing
much
energy
and
alertness
full
face
her
expression
was
more
changing
uncertain
complex
her
eyes
and
her
cheeks
were
irregular
she
seemed
to
give
revelation
of
a
strong
race
and
in
the
mold
of
that
race
roughly
thrown
together
were
manifold
incongruous
elements
of
doubtful
and
unequal
quality
beautiful
and
vulgar
at
the
same
time
her
beauty
lay
especially
in
her
silent
lips
and
in
her
eyes
in
which
there
seemed
to
be
greater
depth
by
reason
of
their
and
darker
by
reason
of
the
bluish
markings
round
them
it
needed
to
be
more
used
than
christophe
was
to
those
eyes
which
are
more
those
of
a
race
than
of
an
individual
to
be
able
to
read
through
the
limpidity
that
unveiled
them
with
such
vivid
quality
the
real
soul
of
the
woman
whom
he
thus
encountered
it
was
the
soul
of
the
people
of
israel
that
he
saw
in
her
sad
and
burning
eyes
the
soul
that
unknown
to
them
shone
forth
from
them
he
lost
himself
as
he
gazed
into
them
it
was
only
after
some
time
that
he
was
able
after
losing
his
way
again
and
again
to
strike
the
track
again
on
that
oriental
sea
she
looked
at
him
and
nothing
could
disturb
the
clearness
of
her
gaze
nothing
in
his
christian
soul
seemed
to
escape
her
he
felt
that
under
the
seduction
of
the
woman
eyes
upon
him
he
was
conscious
of
a
virile
desire
clear
and
cold
which
stirred
in
him
brutally
indiscreetly
there
was
no
evil
in
the
brutality
of
it
she
took
possession
of
him
not
like
a
coquette
whose
desire
is
to
seduce
without
caring
whom
she
seduces
had
she
been
a
coquette
she
would
have
gone
to
greatest
lengths
but
she
knew
her
power
and
she
left
it
to
her
natural
instinct
to
make
use
of
it
in
its
own
way
especially
when
she
had
so
easy
a
prey
as
what
interested
her
more
was
to
know
her
adversary
any
man
any
stranger
was
an
adversary
for
her
an
adversary
with
whom
later
on
if
occasion
served
she
could
sign
a
compact
of
alliance
she
wished
to
know
his
quality
life
being
a
game
in
which
the
cleverest
wins
it
was
a
matter
of
reading
her
opponent
cards
and
of
not
showing
her
own
when
she
succeeded
she
tasted
the
sweets
of
victory
it
mattered
little
whether
she
could
turn
it
to
any
account
it
was
purely
for
her
pleasure
she
had
a
passion
for
intelligence
not
abstract
intelligence
although
she
had
brains
enough
if
she
had
liked
to
have
succeeded
in
any
branch
of
knowledge
and
would
have
made
a
much
better
successor
to
lothair
mannheim
the
banker
than
her
brother
but
she
preferred
intelligence
in
the
quick
the
sort
of
intelligence
which
studies
men
she
loved
to
pierce
through
to
the
soul
and
to
weigh
its
value
she
gave
as
scrupulous
an
attention
to
it
as
the
jewess
of
matsys
to
the
weighing
of
her
gold
with
marvelous
divination
she
could
find
the
weak
spot
in
the
armor
the
imperfections
and
foibles
which
are
the
key
to
the
soul
she
could
lay
her
hands
on
its
secrets
it
was
her
way
of
feeling
her
sway
over
it
but
she
never
dallied
with
her
victory
she
never
did
anything
with
her
prize
once
her
curiosity
and
her
vanity
were
satisfied
she
lost
her
interest
and
passed
on
to
another
specimen
all
her
power
was
sterile
there
was
something
of
death
in
her
living
soul
she
had
the
genius
of
curiosity
and
boredom
and
so
she
looked
at
christophe
and
he
looked
at
her
she
hardly
spoke
an
imperceptible
smile
was
enough
a
little
movement
of
the
corners
of
her
mouth
christophe
was
hypnotized
by
her
every
now
and
then
her
smile
would
fade
away
her
face
would
become
cold
her
eyes
indifferent
she
would
attend
to
the
meal
or
speak
coldly
to
the
servants
it
was
as
though
she
were
no
longer
listening
then
her
eyes
would
light
up
again
and
a
few
words
coming
pat
would
show
that
she
had
heard
and
understood
everything
she
coldly
examined
her
brother
judgment
of
christophe
she
knew
crazes
her
irony
had
had
fine
sport
when
she
saw
christophe
appear
whose
looks
and
distinction
had
been
vaunted
by
her
brother
it
seemed
to
her
that
franz
had
a
special
gift
for
seeing
facts
as
they
are
not
or
perhaps
he
only
thought
it
a
paradoxical
joke
but
when
she
looked
at
christophe
more
closely
she
recognized
that
what
franz
had
said
was
not
altogether
false
and
as
she
went
on
with
her
scrutiny
she
discovered
in
christophe
a
vague
unbalanced
though
robust
and
bold
power
that
gave
her
pleasure
for
she
knew
better
than
any
the
rarity
of
power
she
was
able
to
make
christophe
talk
about
whatever
she
liked
and
reveal
his
thoughts
and
display
the
limitations
and
defects
of
his
mind
she
made
him
play
the
piano
she
did
not
love
music
but
she
understood
it
and
she
saw
christophe
musical
originality
although
his
music
had
roused
no
sort
of
emotion
in
her
without
the
least
change
in
the
coldness
of
her
manner
with
a
few
short
apt
and
certainly
not
flattering
remarks
she
showed
her
growing
interest
in
christophe
christophe
saw
it
and
he
was
proud
of
it
for
he
felt
the
worth
of
such
judgment
and
the
rarity
of
her
approbation
he
made
no
secret
of
his
desire
to
win
it
and
he
set
about
it
so
naïvely
as
to
make
the
three
of
them
smile
he
talked
only
to
judith
and
for
judith
he
was
as
unconcerned
with
the
others
as
though
they
did
not
exist
franz
watched
him
as
he
talked
he
followed
his
every
word
with
his
lips
and
eyes
with
a
mixture
of
admiration
and
amusement
and
he
laughed
aloud
as
he
glanced
at
his
father
and
his
sister
who
listened
impassively
and
pretended
not
to
notice
him
lothair
mannheim
a
tall
old
man
heavily
built
stooping
a
little
with
gray
hair
standing
straight
up
on
end
very
black
mustache
and
eyebrows
a
heavy
though
energetic
and
jovial
face
which
gave
the
impression
of
great
vitality
had
also
studied
christophe
during
the
first
part
of
the
dinner
slyly
but
and
he
too
had
recognized
at
once
that
there
was
something
in
the
boy
but
he
was
not
interested
in
music
or
musicians
it
was
not
in
his
line
he
knew
nothing
about
it
and
made
no
secret
of
his
ignorance
he
even
boasted
of
it
when
a
man
of
that
sort
confesses
his
ignorance
of
anything
he
does
so
to
feed
his
vanity
as
christophe
had
clearly
shown
at
once
with
a
rudeness
in
which
there
was
no
shade
of
malice
that
he
could
without
regret
dispense
with
the
society
of
the
banker
and
that
the
society
of
fräulein
judith
mannheim
would
serve
perfectly
to
fill
his
evening
old
lothair
in
some
amusement
had
taken
his
seat
by
the
fire
he
read
his
paper
listening
vaguely
and
ironically
to
christophe
crotchets
and
his
queer
music
which
sometimes
made
him
laugh
inwardly
at
the
idea
that
there
could
be
people
who
understood
it
and
found
pleasure
in
it
he
did
not
trouble
to
follow
the
conversation
he
relied
on
his
daughter
cleverness
to
tell
him
exactly
what
the
newcomer
was
worth
she
discharged
her
duty
conscientiously
when
christophe
had
gone
lothair
asked
judith
well
you
probed
him
enough
what
do
you
think
of
the
artist
she
laughed
thought
for
a
moment
reckoned
up
and
said
he
is
a
little
cracked
but
he
is
not
stupid
good
said
lothair
i
thought
so
too
he
will
succeed
then
yes
i
think
so
he
has
power
very
good
said
lothair
with
the
magnificent
logic
of
the
strong
who
are
only
interested
in
the
strong
we
must
help
him
christophe
went
away
filled
with
admiration
for
judith
mannheim
he
was
not
in
love
with
her
as
judith
thought
they
were
both
she
with
her
subtlety
he
with
his
instinct
which
took
the
place
of
mind
in
him
mistaken
about
each
other
christophe
was
fascinated
by
the
enigma
and
the
intense
activity
of
her
mind
but
he
did
not
love
her
his
eyes
and
his
intelligence
were
ensnared
his
heart
why
it
were
difficult
to
tell
because
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
some
doubtful
disturbing
quality
in
her
in
other
circumstances
that
would
have
been
a
reason
the
more
for
loving
love
is
never
stronger
than
when
it
goes
out
to
one
who
will
make
it
if
christophe
did
not
love
judith
it
was
not
the
fault
of
either
of
them
the
real
reason
humiliating
enough
for
both
was
that
he
was
still
too
near
his
last
love
experience
had
not
made
him
wiser
but
he
had
loved
ada
so
much
he
had
consumed
so
much
faith
force
and
illusion
in
that
passion
that
there
was
not
enough
left
for
a
new
passion
before
another
flame
could
be
kindled
he
would
have
to
build
a
new
pyre
in
his
heart
short
of
that
there
could
only
be
a
few
flickerings
remnants
of
the
conflagration
that
had
escaped
by
chance
which
asked
only
to
be
allowed
to
burn
cast
a
brief
and
brilliant
light
and
then
died
down
for
want
of
food
six
months
later
perhaps
he
might
have
loved
judith
blindly
now
he
saw
in
her
only
a
friend
a
rather
disturbing
friend
in
truth
but
he
tried
to
drive
his
uneasiness
back
it
reminded
him
of
ada
there
was
no
attraction
in
that
memory
he
preferred
not
to
think
of
it
what
attracted
him
in
judith
was
everything
in
her
which
was
different
from
other
women
not
that
which
she
had
in
common
with
them
she
was
the
first
intelligent
woman
he
had
met
she
was
intelligent
from
head
to
foot
even
her
beauty
her
gestures
her
movements
her
features
the
fold
of
her
lips
her
eyes
her
hands
her
slender
elegance
was
the
reflection
of
her
intelligence
her
body
was
molded
by
her
intelligence
without
her
intelligence
she
would
have
passed
unnoticed
and
no
doubt
she
would
even
have
been
thought
plain
by
most
people
her
intelligence
delighted
christophe
he
thought
it
larger
and
more
free
than
it
was
he
could
not
yet
know
how
deceptive
it
was
he
longed
ardently
to
confide
in
her
and
to
impart
his
ideas
to
her
he
had
never
found
anybody
to
take
an
interest
in
his
dreams
he
was
turned
in
upon
himself
what
joy
then
to
find
a
woman
to
be
his
friend
that
he
had
not
a
sister
had
been
one
of
the
sorrows
of
his
childhood
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
sister
would
have
understood
him
more
than
a
brother
could
have
done
and
when
he
met
judith
he
felt
that
childish
and
illusory
hope
of
having
a
brotherly
love
spring
up
in
him
not
being
in
love
love
seemed
to
him
a
poor
thing
compared
with
friendship
judith
felt
this
little
shade
of
feeling
and
was
hurt
by
it
she
was
not
in
love
with
christophe
and
as
she
had
excited
other
passions
in
other
young
men
of
the
town
rich
young
men
of
better
position
she
could
not
feel
any
great
satisfaction
in
knowing
christophe
to
be
in
love
with
her
but
it
piqued
her
to
know
that
he
was
not
in
love
no
doubt
she
was
pleased
with
him
for
confiding
his
plans
she
was
not
surprised
by
it
but
it
was
a
little
mortifying
for
her
to
know
that
she
could
only
exercise
an
intellectual
influence
over
him
an
unreasoning
influence
is
much
more
precious
to
a
woman
she
did
not
even
exercise
her
influence
christophe
only
courted
her
mind
judith
intellect
was
imperious
she
was
used
to
molding
to
her
will
the
soft
thoughts
of
the
young
men
of
her
acquaintance
as
she
knew
their
mediocrity
she
found
no
pleasure
in
holding
sway
over
them
with
christophe
the
pursuit
was
more
interesting
because
more
difficult
she
was
not
interested
in
his
projects
but
she
would
have
liked
to
direct
his
originality
of
thought
his
power
and
to
make
them
good
in
her
own
way
of
course
and
not
in
christophe
which
she
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
understand
she
saw
at
once
that
she
could
not
succeed
without
a
struggle
she
had
marked
down
in
christophe
all
sorts
of
notions
and
ideas
which
she
thought
childish
and
extravagant
they
were
weeds
to
her
she
tried
hard
to
eradicate
them
she
did
not
get
rid
of
a
single
one
she
did
not
gain
the
least
satisfaction
for
her
vanity
christophe
was
intractable
not
being
in
love
he
had
no
reason
for
surrendering
his
ideas
to
her
she
grew
keen
on
the
game
and
instinctively
tried
for
some
time
to
overcome
him
christophe
was
very
nearly
taken
in
again
in
spite
of
his
lucidity
of
mind
at
that
time
men
are
easily
taken
in
by
any
flattery
of
their
vanity
or
their
desires
and
an
artist
is
twice
as
easy
to
trick
as
any
other
man
because
he
has
more
imagination
judith
had
only
to
draw
christophe
into
a
dangerous
flirtation
to
bowl
him
over
once
more
more
thoroughly
than
ever
but
as
usual
she
soon
wearied
of
the
game
she
found
that
such
a
conquest
was
hardly
worth
while
christophe
was
already
boring
her
she
did
not
understand
him
she
did
not
understand
him
beyond
a
certain
point
up
to
that
she
understood
everything
her
admirable
intelligence
could
not
take
her
beyond
it
she
needed
a
heart
or
in
default
of
that
the
thing
which
could
give
the
illusion
of
one
for
a
time
love
she
understood
christophe
criticism
of
people
and
things
it
amused
her
and
seemed
to
her
true
enough
she
had
thought
much
the
same
herself
but
what
she
did
not
understand
was
that
such
ideas
might
have
an
influence
on
practical
life
when
it
might
be
dangerous
or
awkward
to
apply
them
the
attitude
of
revolt
against
everybody
and
everything
which
christophe
had
taken
up
led
to
nothing
he
could
not
imagine
that
he
was
going
to
reform
the
world
and
then
it
was
waste
of
time
to
knock
one
head
against
a
wall
a
clever
man
judges
men
laughs
at
them
in
secret
despises
them
a
little
but
he
does
as
they
do
only
a
little
better
it
is
the
only
way
of
mastering
them
thought
is
one
world
action
is
another
what
boots
it
for
a
man
to
be
the
victim
of
his
thoughts
since
men
are
so
stupid
as
not
to
be
able
to
bear
the
truth
why
force
it
on
them
to
accept
their
weakness
to
seem
to
bow
to
it
and
to
feel
free
to
despise
them
in
his
heart
is
there
not
a
secret
joy
in
that
the
joy
of
a
clever
slave
certainly
but
all
the
world
is
a
slave
there
is
no
getting
away
from
that
it
is
useless
to
protest
against
it
better
to
be
a
slave
deliberately
of
one
own
free
will
and
to
avoid
ridiculous
and
futile
conflict
besides
the
worst
slavery
of
all
is
to
be
the
slave
of
one
own
thoughts
and
to
sacrifice
everything
to
them
there
is
no
need
to
deceive
one
she
saw
clearly
that
if
christophe
went
on
as
he
seemed
determined
to
do
with
his
aggressive
refusal
to
compromise
with
the
prejudices
of
german
art
and
german
mind
he
would
turn
everybody
against
him
even
his
patrons
he
was
courting
inevitable
ruin
she
did
not
understand
why
he
so
obstinately
held
out
against
himself
and
so
took
pleasure
in
digging
his
own
ruin
to
have
understood
him
she
would
have
had
to
be
able
to
understand
that
his
aim
was
not
success
but
his
own
faith
he
believed
in
art
he
believed
in
art
he
believed
in
himself
as
realities
not
only
superior
to
interest
but
also
to
his
own
life
when
he
was
a
little
out
of
patience
with
her
remarks
and
told
her
so
in
his
naïve
arrogance
she
just
shrugged
her
shoulders
she
did
not
take
him
seriously
she
thought
he
was
using
big
words
such
as
she
was
accustomed
to
hearing
from
her
brother
when
he
announced
periodically
his
absurd
and
ridiculous
resolutions
which
he
never
by
any
chance
put
into
practice
and
then
when
she
saw
that
christophe
really
believed
in
what
he
said
she
thought
him
mad
and
lost
interest
in
him
after
that
she
took
no
trouble
to
appear
to
advantage
and
she
showed
herself
as
she
was
much
more
german
and
average
german
than
she
seemed
to
be
at
first
more
perhaps
than
she
the
jews
are
quite
erroneously
reproached
with
not
belonging
to
any
nation
and
with
forming
from
one
end
of
europe
to
the
other
a
homogeneous
people
impervious
to
the
influence
of
the
different
races
with
which
they
have
pitched
their
tents
in
reality
there
is
no
race
which
more
easily
takes
on
the
impress
of
the
country
through
which
it
passes
and
if
there
are
many
characteristics
in
common
between
a
french
jew
and
a
german
jew
there
are
many
more
different
characteristics
derived
from
their
new
country
of
which
with
incredible
rapidity
they
assimilate
the
habits
of
mind
more
the
habits
than
the
mind
indeed
but
habit
which
is
a
second
nature
to
all
men
is
in
most
of
them
all
the
nature
that
they
have
and
the
result
is
that
the
majority
of
the
autochthonous
citizens
of
any
country
have
very
little
right
to
reproach
the
jews
with
the
lack
of
a
profound
and
reasonable
national
feeling
of
which
they
themselves
possess
nothing
at
all
the
women
always
more
sensible
to
external
influences
more
easily
adaptable
to
the
conditions
of
life
and
to
change
with
them
jewish
women
throughout
europe
assume
the
physical
and
moral
customs
often
exaggerating
them
of
the
country
in
which
they
live
without
losing
the
shadow
and
the
strange
fluid
solid
and
haunting
quality
of
their
this
idea
came
to
christophe
at
the
mannheims
he
met
judith
aunts
cousins
and
friends
though
there
was
little
of
the
german
in
their
eyes
ardent
and
too
close
together
their
noses
going
down
to
their
lips
their
strong
features
their
red
blood
coursing
under
their
coarse
brown
skins
though
almost
all
of
them
seemed
hardly
at
all
fashioned
to
be
german
they
were
all
extraordinarily
german
they
had
the
same
way
of
talking
of
dressing
of
judith
was
much
the
best
of
them
all
and
comparison
with
them
made
all
that
was
exceptional
in
her
intelligence
all
that
she
had
made
of
herself
shine
forth
but
she
had
most
of
their
faults
just
as
much
as
they
she
was
much
more
free
than
they
morally
almost
absolutely
free
but
socially
she
was
no
more
free
or
at
least
her
practical
sense
usurped
the
place
of
her
freedom
of
mind
she
believed
in
society
in
class
in
prejudice
because
when
all
was
told
she
found
them
to
her
advantage
it
was
idle
for
her
to
laugh
at
the
german
spirit
she
followed
it
like
any
german
her
intelligence
made
her
see
the
mediocrity
of
some
artist
of
reputation
but
she
respected
him
none
the
less
because
of
his
reputation
and
if
she
met
him
personally
she
would
admire
him
for
her
vanity
was
flattered
she
had
no
love
for
the
works
of
brahms
and
she
suspected
him
of
being
an
artist
of
the
second
rank
but
his
fame
impressed
her
and
as
she
had
received
five
or
six
letters
from
him
the
result
was
that
she
thought
him
the
greatest
musician
of
the
day
she
had
no
doubt
as
to
christophe
real
worth
or
as
to
the
stupidity
of
lieutenant
detlev
von
fleischer
but
she
was
more
flattered
by
the
homage
the
lieutenant
deigned
to
pay
to
her
millions
than
by
christophe
friendship
for
a
dull
officer
is
a
man
of
another
caste
it
is
more
difficult
for
a
german
jewess
to
enter
that
caste
than
for
any
other
woman
although
she
was
not
deceived
by
these
feudal
follies
and
although
she
knew
quite
well
that
if
she
did
marry
lieutenant
detlev
von
fleischer
she
would
be
doing
him
a
great
honor
she
set
herself
to
the
conquest
she
stooped
so
low
as
to
make
eyes
at
the
fool
and
to
flatter
his
vanity
the
proud
jewess
who
had
a
thousand
reasons
for
her
pride
the
clever
disdainful
daughter
of
mannheim
the
banker
lowered
herself
and
acted
like
any
of
the
little
german
women
whom
she
despised
that
experience
was
short
christophe
lost
his
illusions
about
judith
as
quickly
as
he
had
found
them
it
is
only
just
to
say
that
judith
did
nothing
to
preserve
them
as
soon
as
a
woman
of
that
stamp
has
judged
a
man
she
is
done
with
him
he
ceases
to
exist
for
her
she
will
not
see
him
again
and
she
no
more
hesitates
to
reveal
her
soul
to
him
with
calm
impudence
that
to
appear
naked
before
her
dog
her
cat
or
any
other
domestic
animal
christophe
saw
judith
egoism
and
coldness
and
the
mediocrity
of
her
character
he
had
not
had
time
to
be
absolutely
caught
but
he
had
been
enough
caught
to
make
him
suffer
and
to
bring
him
to
a
sort
of
fever
he
did
not
so
much
love
judith
as
what
she
might
have
been
what
she
ought
to
have
been
her
fine
eyes
exercised
a
melancholy
fascination
over
him
he
could
not
forget
them
although
he
knew
now
the
drab
soul
that
slumbered
in
their
depths
he
went
on
seeing
them
as
he
wished
to
see
them
as
he
had
first
seen
them
it
was
one
of
those
loveless
hallucinations
of
love
which
take
up
so
much
of
the
hearts
of
artists
when
they
are
not
entirely
absorbed
by
their
work
a
passing
face
is
enough
to
create
it
they
see
in
it
all
the
beauty
that
is
in
it
unknown
to
its
indifferent
possessor
and
they
love
it
the
more
for
its
indifference
they
love
it
as
a
beautiful
thing
that
must
die
without
any
man
having
known
its
worth
or
that
it
even
had
life
perhaps
he
was
deceiving
himself
and
judith
mannheim
could
not
have
been
anything
more
than
she
was
but
for
a
moment
christophe
had
believed
in
her
and
her
charm
endured
he
could
not
judge
her
impartially
all
her
beauty
seemed
to
him
to
be
hers
to
be
herself
all
that
was
vulgar
in
her
he
cast
back
upon
her
twofold
race
jew
and
german
and
perhaps
he
was
more
indignant
with
the
german
than
with
the
jew
for
it
had
made
him
suffer
more
as
he
did
not
yet
know
any
other
nation
the
german
spirit
was
for
him
a
sort
of
scapegoat
he
put
upon
it
all
the
sins
of
the
world
that
judith
had
deceived
him
was
a
reason
the
more
for
combating
it
he
could
not
forgive
it
for
having
crushed
the
life
out
of
such
a
soul
such
was
his
first
encounter
with
israel
he
had
hoped
much
from
it
he
had
hoped
to
find
in
that
strong
race
living
apart
from
the
rest
an
ally
for
his
fight
he
lost
that
hope
with
the
flexibility
of
his
passionate
intuition
which
made
him
leap
from
one
extreme
to
another
he
persuaded
himself
that
the
jewish
race
was
much
weaker
than
it
was
said
to
be
and
much
more
open
much
too
open
to
outside
influence
it
had
all
its
own
weaknesses
augmented
by
those
of
the
rest
of
the
world
picked
up
on
its
way
it
was
not
in
them
that
he
could
find
assistance
in
working
the
lever
of
his
art
rather
he
was
in
danger
of
being
swallowed
with
them
in
the
sands
of
the
desert
having
seen
the
danger
and
not
feeling
sure
enough
of
himself
to
brave
it
he
suddenly
gave
up
going
to
the
mannheims
he
was
invited
several
times
and
begged
to
be
excused
without
giving
any
reason
as
up
till
then
he
had
shown
an
excessive
eagerness
to
accept
such
a
sudden
change
was
remarked
it
was
attributed
to
his
originality
but
the
mannheims
had
no
doubt
that
the
fair
judith
had
something
to
do
with
it
lothair
and
franz
joked
about
it
at
dinner
judith
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
said
it
was
a
fine
conquest
and
she
asked
her
brother
frigidly
not
to
make
such
a
fuss
about
it
but
she
left
no
stone
unturned
in
her
effort
to
bring
christophe
back
she
wrote
to
him
for
some
musical
information
which
no
one
else
could
supply
and
at
the
end
of
her
letter
she
made
a
friendly
allusion
to
the
rarity
of
his
visits
and
the
pleasure
it
would
give
them
to
see
him
christophe
replied
giving
the
desired
information
said
that
he
was
very
busy
and
did
not
go
they
met
sometimes
at
the
theater
christophe
obstinately
looked
away
from
the
mannheims
box
and
he
would
pretend
not
to
see
judith
who
held
herself
in
readiness
to
give
him
her
most
charming
smile
she
did
not
persist
as
she
did
not
count
on
him
for
anything
she
was
annoyed
that
the
little
artist
should
let
her
do
all
the
labor
of
their
friendship
and
pure
waste
at
that
if
he
wanted
to
come
he
would
if
not
oh
well
they
could
do
without
him
they
did
without
him
and
his
absence
left
no
very
great
gap
in
the
mannheims
evenings
but
in
spite
of
herself
judith
was
really
annoyed
with
christophe
it
seemed
natural
enough
not
to
bother
about
him
when
he
was
there
and
she
could
allow
him
to
show
his
displeasure
at
being
neglected
but
that
his
displeasure
should
go
so
far
as
to
break
off
their
relationship
altogether
seemed
to
her
to
show
a
stupid
pride
and
a
heart
more
egoistic
than
in
judith
could
not
tolerate
her
own
faults
in
others
she
followed
the
more
attentively
everything
that
christophe
did
and
wrote
without
seeming
to
do
so
she
would
lead
her
brother
to
the
subject
of
christophe
she
would
make
him
tell
her
of
his
intercourse
with
him
and
she
would
punctuate
the
narrative
with
clever
ironic
comment
which
never
let
any
ridiculous
feature
escape
and
gradually
destroyed
enthusiasm
without
his
knowing
it
at
first
all
went
well
with
the
review
christophe
had
not
yet
perceived
the
mediocrity
of
his
colleagues
and
since
he
was
one
of
them
they
hailed
him
as
a
genius
mannheim
who
had
discovered
him
went
everywhere
repeating
that
christophe
was
an
admirable
critic
though
he
had
never
read
anything
he
had
written
that
he
had
mistaken
his
vocation
and
that
he
mannheim
had
revealed
it
to
him
they
advertised
his
articles
in
mysterious
terms
which
roused
curiosity
and
his
first
effort
was
in
fact
like
a
stone
falling
into
a
in
the
atony
of
the
little
town
it
was
called
much
too
much
music
too
much
drinking
too
much
eating
wrote
christophe
eating
drinking
hearing
without
hunger
thirst
or
need
from
sheer
habitual
gormandizing
living
like
strasburg
geese
these
people
are
sick
from
a
diseased
appetite
it
matters
little
what
you
give
them
or
the
von
beethoven
or
mascagni
a
fugue
or
a
adam
bach
puccini
mozart
or
marschner
they
do
not
know
what
they
are
eating
the
great
thing
is
to
eat
they
find
no
pleasure
in
it
look
at
them
at
a
concert
talk
of
german
gaiety
these
people
do
not
know
what
gaiety
means
they
are
always
gay
their
gaiety
like
their
sorrow
drops
like
rain
their
joy
is
dust
there
is
neither
life
nor
force
in
it
they
would
stay
for
hours
smilingly
and
vaguely
drinking
in
sounds
sounds
sounds
they
think
of
nothing
they
feel
nothing
they
are
sponges
true
joy
or
true
sorrow
strength
is
not
drawn
out
over
hours
like
beer
from
a
cask
they
take
you
by
the
throat
and
have
you
down
after
they
are
gone
there
is
no
desire
left
in
a
man
to
drink
in
anything
he
is
full
too
much
music
you
are
slaying
each
other
and
it
if
you
choose
to
murder
each
other
that
is
your
affair
i
ca
help
it
but
where
music
is
concerned
hands
off
i
will
not
suffer
you
to
debase
the
loveliness
of
the
world
by
heaping
up
in
the
same
basket
things
holy
and
things
shameful
by
giving
as
you
do
at
present
the
prelude
to
between
a
fantasia
on
the
of
the
and
a
saxophone
quartette
or
an
adagio

then
choose

quoted
the
lines
of
old
gottfried
keller
the
rude
citizen
of
zurich
one
of
the
german
writers

was
most
dear
to
him
by
reason
of
his
vigorous
loyalty
and
his
keen
savor
of

if

like

then
say

frankly
show

see

as
you

souls
of
the
loathsome
burden
of
all
your
compromise

you

dear
public

but
for
any
sake
be
true
be
true
even
though
art
and
artists
and
i
myself
have
to
suffer
for
it
if
art
and
truth
can
not
live
together
then
let
art
disappear
truth
is
life
lies
are
death
naturally
this
youthful
wild
outburst
which
was
all
of
a
piece
and
in
very
bad
taste
produced
an
outcry
and
yet
as
everybody
was
attacked
and
nobody
in
particular
its
pertinency
was
not
recognized
every
one
is
or
believes
himself
to
be
or
says
that
he
is
the
best
friend
of
truth
there
was
therefore
no
danger
of
the
conclusions
of
the
article
being
attacked
only
people
were
shocked
by
its
general
tone
everybody
agreed
that
it
was
hardly
proper
especially
from
an
artist
in
a
position
a
few
musicians
began
to
be
uneasy
and
protested
bitterly
they
saw
that
christophe
would
not
stop
at
that
others
thought
themselves
more
clever
and
congratulated
christophe
on
his
courage
they
were
no
less
uneasy
about
his
next
articles
both
tactics
produced
the
same
result
christophe
had
plunged
nothing
could
stop
him
and
as
he
had
promised
everybody
was
passed
in
survey
composers
and
interpreters
alike
the
first
victims
were
the
christophe
did
not
confine
himself
to
general
remarks
on
the
art
of
conducting
an
orchestra
he
mentioned
his
colleagues
of
his
own
town
and
the
neighboring
towns
by
name
or
if
he
did
not
name
them
his
allusions
were
so
transparent
that
nobody
could
be
mistaken
everybody
recognized
the
apathetic
conductor
of
the
court
alois
von
werner
a
cautious
old
man
laden
with
honors
who
was
afraid
of
everything
dodged
everything
was
too
timid
to
make
a
remark
to
his
musicians
and
meekly
followed
whatever
they
chose
to
do
who
never
risked
anything
on
his
programme
that
had
not
been
consecrated
by
twenty
years
of
success
or
at
least
guaranteed
by
the
official
stamp
of
some
academic
dignity
christophe
ironically
applauded
his
boldness
he
congratulated
him
on
having
discovered
gade
dvorak
or
tschaikowsky
he
waxed
enthusiastic
over
his
unfailing
correctness
his
metronomic
equality
the
always
finely
shaded
playing
of
his
orchestra
he
proposed
to
orchestrate
the
de
la
of
czerny
for
his
next
concert
and
implored
him
not
to
try
himself
so
much
not
to
give
rein
to
his
passions
to
look
after
his
precious
or
he
cried
out
indignantly
upon
the
way
in
which
he
had
conducted
the
of
beethoven
a
cannon
a
cannon
mow
me
down
these
people
but
have
you
then
no
idea
of
the
conflict
the
fight
between
human
stupidity
and
human
ferocity
and
the
strength
which
tramples
them
underfoot
with
a
glad
shout
of
laughter
how
could
you
know
it
it
is
you
against
whom
it
fights
you
expend
all
the
heroism
that
is
in
you
in
listening
or
in
playing
the
of
beethoven
without
a
yawn
for
it
bores
you
confess
that
it
bores
you
to
death
or
in
risking
a
draught
as
you
stand
with
bare
head
and
bowed
back
to
let
some
serene
highness
pass
he
could
not
be
sarcastic
enough
about
the
pontiffs
of
the
conservatories
who
interpreted
the
great
men
of
the
past
as
classics
classical
that
word
expresses
everything
free
passion
arranged
and
expurgated
for
the
use
of
schools
life
that
vast
plain
swept
by
the
winds
inclosed
within
the
four
walls
of
a
school
playground
the
fierce
proud
beat
of
a
heart
in
anguish
reduced
to
the
of
a
pendulum
which
goes
its
jolly
way
hobbling
and
imperturbably
leaning
on
the
crutch
of
time
to
enjoy
the
ocean
you
need
to
put
it
in
a
bowl
with
goldfish
you
only
understand
life
when
you
have
killed
it
if
he
was
not
kind
to
the
as
he
called
them
he
was
even
less
kind
to
the
ringmen
of
the
orchestra
the
illustrious
who
toured
the
country
to
show
off
their
flourishes
and
their
dainty
hands
those
who
exercised
their
virtuosity
at
the
expense
of
the
masters
tried
hard
to
make
the
most
familiar
works
unrecognizable
and
turned
somersaults
through
the
hoop
of
the
in
c
he
made
them
appear
as
old
coquettes
of
the
orchestra
gipsies
and
the
naturally
provided
him
with
splendid
material
he
declared
himself
incompetent
when
he
had
to
criticise
their
conjuring
performances
he
said
that
such
mechanical
exercises
belonged
to
the
school
of
arts
and
crafts
and
that
not
musical
criticism
but
charts
registering
the
duration
and
number
of
the
notes
and
the
energy
expended
could
decide
the
merit
of
such
labors
sometimes
he
would
set
at
naught
some
famous
piano
who
during
a
two
hours
concert
had
surmounted
the
formidable
difficulties
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
and
his
hair
hanging
down
into
his
eyes
of
executing
a
childish
of
he
did
not
ignore
the
pleasure
of
overcoming
difficulties
he
had
tasted
it
himself
it
was
one
of
the
joys
of
life
to
him
but
only
to
see
the
most
material
aspect
of
it
and
to
reduce
all
the
heroism
of
art
to
that
seemed
to
him
grotesque
and
degrading
he
could
not
forgive
the
lions
or
panthers
of
the
but
he
was
not
very
indulgent
either
towards
the
town
pedants
famous
in
germany
who
while
they
are
rightly
anxious
not
to
alter
the
text
of
the
masters
carefully
suppress
every
flight
of
thought
and
like
and
von
bülow
seem
to
be
giving
a
lesson
in
diction
when
they
are
rendering
a
passionate
sonata
the
singers
had
their
turn
christophe
was
full
to
the
brim
of
things
to
say
about
their
barbarous
heaviness
and
their
provincial
affectations
it
was
not
only
because
of
his
recent
misadventures
with
the
enraged
lady
but
because
of
all
the
torture
he
had
suffered
during
so
many
performances
it
was
difficult
to
know
which
had
suffered
most
ears
or
eyes
and
christophe
had
not
enough
standards
of
comparison
to
be
able
to
have
any
idea
of
the
ugliness
of
the
setting
the
hideous
costumes
the
screaming
colors
he
was
only
shocked
by
the
vulgarity
of
the
people
their
gestures
and
attitudes
their
unnatural
playing
the
inability
of
the
actors
to
take
on
other
souls
than
their
own
and
by
the
stupefying
indifference
with
which
they
passed
from
one
rôle
to
another
provided
they
were
written
more
or
less
in
the
same
register
matrons
of
opulent
flesh
hearty
and
buxom
appeared
alternately
as
ysolde
and
carmen
amfortas
played
but
what
most
offended
christophe
was
the
ugliness
of
the
singing
especially
in
the
classical
works
in
which
the
beauty
of
melody
is
essential
no
one
in
germany
could
sing
the
perfect
music
of
the
eighteenth
century
no
one
would
take
the
trouble
the
clear
pure
style
of
gluck
and
mozart
which
like
that
of
goethe
seems
to
be
bathed
in
the
light
of
italy
the
style
which
begins
to
change
and
to
become
vibrant
and
dazzling
with
weber
the
style
ridiculed
by
the
ponderous
caricatures
of
the
author
of
had
been
killed
by
the
triumph
of
wagner
the
wild
flight
of
the
valkyries
with
their
strident
cries
had
passed
over
the
grecian
sky
the
heavy
clouds
of
odin
dimmed
the
light
no
one
now
thought
of
singing
music
they
sang
poems
ugliness
and
carelessness
of
detail
even
false
notes
were
let
pass
under
pretext
that
only
the
whole
only
the
thought
behind
it
mattered
thought
let
us
talk
of
that
as
if
you
understood
it
but
whether
or
no
you
do
understand
it
i
pray
you
respect
the
form
that
thought
has
chosen
for
itself
above
all
let
music
be
and
remain
music
and
the
great
concern
of
german
artists
with
expression
and
profundity
of
thought
was
according
to
christophe
a
good
joke
expression
thought
yes
they
introduced
them
into
everything
everything
impartially
they
would
have
found
thought
in
a
skein
of
wool
just
as
much
neither
more
nor
less
as
in
a
statue
of
michael
angelo
they
played
anything
music
with
exactly
the
same
energy
for
most
of
them
the
great
thing
in
music
so
he
declared
was
the
volume
of
sound
just
a
musical
noise
the
pleasure
of
singing
so
potent
in
germany
was
in
some
sort
a
pleasure
of
vocal
gymnastics
it
was
just
a
matter
of
being
inflated
with
air
and
then
letting
it
go
vigorously
powerfully
for
a
long
time
together
and
and
by
way
of
compliment
he
accorded
a
certain
great
singer
a
certificate
of
good
health
he
was
not
content
with
flaying
the
artists
he
strode
over
the
footlights
and
trounced
the
public
for
coming
gaping
to
such
performances
the
public
was
staggered
and
did
not
know
whether
it
ought
to
laugh
or
be
angry
they
had
every
right
to
cry
out
upon
his
injustice
they
had
taken
care
not
to
be
mixed
up
in
any
artistic
conflict
they
stood
aside
prudently
from
any
burning
question
and
to
avoid
making
any
mistake
they
applauded
everything
and
now
christophe
declared
that
it
was
a
crime
to
applaud
to
applaud
bad
works
that
would
have
been
enough
but
christophe
went
further
he
stormed
at
them
for
applauding
great
works
humbugs
he
said
you
would
have
us
believe
that
you
have
as
much
enthusiasm
as
that
oh
come
spare
yourselves
the
trouble
you
only
prove
exactly
the
opposite
of
what
you
are
trying
to
prove
applaud
if
you
like
those
works
and
passages
which
in
some
measure
deserve
applause
applaud
those
loud
final
movements
which
are
written
as
mozart
said
long
ears
applaud
as
much
as
you
like
then
your
braying
is
anticipated
it
is
part
of
the
but
after
the
of
beethoven
poor
wretches
it
is
the
last
judgment
you
have
just
seen
the
maddening
pass
like
a
storm
over
the
ocean
you
have
seen
the
waterspout
of
an
athletic
and
tremendous
well
which
stops
breaks
reaches
up
to
the
clouds
clinging
by
its
two
hands
above
the
abyss
then
plunging
once
more
into
space
in
full
swing
the
squall
shrieks
and
whirls
along
and
when
the
hurricane
is
at
its
height
there
is
a
sudden
modulation
a
radiance
of
sound
which
cleaves
the
darkness
of
the
sky
and
falls
upon
the
livid
sea
like
a
patch
of
light
it
is
the
end
the
furious
flight
of
the
destroying
angel
stops
short
its
wings
transfixed
by
these
flashes
of
lightning
around
you
all
is
buzzing
and
quivering
the
eye
gazes
fixedly
forward
in
stupor
the
heart
beats
breathing
stops
the
limbs
are
paralyzed
and
hardly
has
the
last
note
sounded
than
already
you
are
gay
and
merry
you
shout
you
laugh
you
criticise
you
applaud
but
you
have
seen
nothing
heard
nothing
felt
nothing
understood
nothing
nothing
nothing
absolutely
nothing
the
sufferings
of
an
artist
are
a
show
to
you
you
think
the
tears
of
agony
of
a
beethoven
are
finely
painted
you
would
cry
to
the
crucifixion
a
great
soul
struggles
all
its
life
long
in
sorrow
to
divert
your
idleness
for
an
hour
so
without
knowing
it
he
confirmed
goethe
great
words
but
he
had
not
yet
attained
his
lofty
serenity
the
people
make
a
sport
of
the
sublime
if
they
could
see
it
as
it
is
they
would
be
unable
to
bear
its
aspect
if
he
had
only
stopped
at
that
but
whirled
along
by
his
enthusiasm
he
swept
past
the
public
and
plunged
like
a
cannon
ball
into
the
sanctuary
the
tabernacle
the
inviolable
refuge
of
mediocrity
criticism
he
bombarded
his
colleagues
one
of
them
had
taken
upon
himself
to
attack
the
most
gifted
of
living
composers
the
most
advanced
representative
of
the
new
school
hassler
the
writer
of
programme
symphonies
extravagant
in
truth
but
full
of
genius
christophe
who
as
perhaps
will
be
remembered
had
been
presented
to
him
when
he
was
a
child
had
always
had
a
secret
tenderness
for
him
in
his
gratitude
for
the
enthusiasm
and
emotion
that
he
had
had
then
to
see
a
stupid
critic
whose
ignorance
he
knew
instructing
a
man
of
that
caliber
calling
him
to
order
and
reminding
him
of
set
principles
infuriated
him
order
order
he
cried
you
do
not
know
any
order
but
that
of
the
police
genius
is
not
to
be
dragged
along
the
beaten
track
it
creates
order
and
makes
its
will
a
law
after
this
arrogant
declaration
he
took
the
unlucky
critic
considered
all
the
idiocies
he
had
written
for
some
time
past
and
administered
correction
all
the
critics
felt
the
affront
up
to
that
time
they
had
stood
aside
from
the
conflict
they
did
not
care
to
risk
a
rebuff
they
knew
christophe
they
knew
his
efficiency
and
they
knew
also
that
he
was
not
certain
of
them
had
discreetly
expressed
their
regret
that
so
gifted
a
composer
should
dabble
in
a
profession
not
his
own
whatever
might
be
their
opinion
when
they
had
one
and
however
hurt
they
might
be
by
christophe
they
respected
in
him
their
own
privilege
of
being
able
to
criticise
everything
without
being
criticised
themselves
but
when
they
saw
christophe
rudely
break
the
tacit
convention
which
bound
them
they
saw
in
him
an
enemy
of
public
order
with
one
consent
it
seemed
revolting
to
them
that
a
very
young
man
should
take
upon
himself
to
show
scant
respect
for
the
national
glories
and
they
began
a
furious
campaign
against
him
they
did
not
write
long
articles
or
consecutive
arguments
they
were
unwilling
to
venture
upon
such
ground
with
an
adversary
better
armed
than
themselves
although
a
journalist
has
the
special
faculty
of
being
able
to
discuss
without
taking
his
adversary
arguments
into
consideration
and
even
without
having
read
them
but
long
experience
had
taught
them
that
as
the
reader
of
a
paper
always
agrees
with
it
even
to
appear
to
argue
was
to
weaken
its
credit
with
him
it
was
necessary
to
affirm
or
better
still
to
deny
negation
is
twice
as
powerful
as
affirmation
it
is
a
direct
consequence
of
the
law
of
gravity
it
is
much
easier
to
drop
a
stone
than
to
throw
it
up
they
adopted
therefore
a
system
of
little
notes
perfidious
ironic
injurious
which
were
repeated
day
by
day
in
an
easily
accessible
position
with
unwearying
assiduity
they
held
the
insolent
christophe
up
to
ridicule
though
they
never
mentioned
him
by
name
but
always
transparently
alluded
to
him
they
twisted
his
words
to
make
them
look
absurd
they
told
anecdotes
about
him
true
for
the
most
part
though
the
rest
were
a
tissue
of
lies
nicely
calculated
to
set
him
at
loggerheads
with
the
whole
town
and
worse
still
with
the
court
even
his
physical
appearance
his
features
his
manner
of
dressing
were
attacked
and
caricatured
in
a
way
that
by
dint
of
repetition
came
to
be
like
him
it
would
have
mattered
little
to
christophe
friends
if
their
review
had
not
also
come
in
for
blows
in
the
battle
in
truth
it
served
rather
as
an
advertisement
there
was
no
desire
to
commit
the
review
to
the
quarrel
rather
the
attempt
was
made
to
cut
christophe
off
from
it
there
was
astonishment
that
it
should
so
compromise
its
good
name
and
they
were
given
to
understand
that
if
they
did
not
take
care
steps
would
be
taken
however
unpleasant
it
might
be
to
make
the
whole
editorial
staff
responsible
there
were
signs
of
attack
gentle
enough
upon
adolf
mai
and
mannheim
which
stirred
up
the
wasps
nest
mannheim
only
laughed
at
it
he
thought
that
it
would
infuriate
his
father
his
uncles
cousins
and
his
innumerable
family
who
took
upon
themselves
to
watch
everything
he
did
and
to
be
scandalized
by
it
but
adolf
mai
took
it
very
seriously
and
blamed
christophe
for
compromising
the
review
christophe
sent
him
packing
the
others
who
had
not
been
attacked
found
it
rather
amusing
that
mai
who
was
apt
to
pontificate
over
them
should
be
their
scapegoat
waldhaus
was
secretly
delighted
he
said
that
there
was
never
a
fight
without
a
few
heads
being
broken
naturally
he
took
good
care
that
it
should
not
be
his
own
he
thought
he
was
sheltered
from
onslaught
by
the
position
of
his
family
and
his
relatives
and
he
saw
no
harm
in
the
jews
his
allies
being
mauled
a
little
ehrenfeld
and
goldenring
who
were
so
far
untouched
would
not
have
been
worried
by
attack
they
could
reply
but
what
did
touch
them
on
the
raw
was
that
christophe
should
go
on
persistently
putting
them
in
the
wrong
with
their
friends
and
especially
their
women
friends
they
had
laughed
loudly
at
the
first
articles
and
thought
them
good
fun
they
admired
christophe
vigorous
they
thought
they
had
only
to
give
the
word
to
check
his
combativeness
or
at
least
to
turn
his
attack
from
men
and
women
whom
they
might
but
no
christophe
would
listen
to
nothing
he
paid
no
heed
to
any
remark
and
went
on
like
a
madman
if
they
let
him
go
on
there
would
be
no
living
in
the
place
already
their
young
women
friends
furious
and
in
tears
had
come
and
made
scenes
at
the
offices
of
the
review
they
brought
all
their
diplomacy
to
bear
on
christophe
to
persuade
him
at
least
to
moderate
certain
of
his
criticisms
christophe
changed
nothing
they
lost
their
tempers
christophe
lost
his
but
he
changed
nothing
waldhaus
was
amused
by
the
unhappiness
of
his
friends
which
in
no
wise
touched
him
and
took
christophe
part
to
annoy
them
perhaps
also
he
was
more
capable
than
they
of
appreciating
christophe
extravagance
who
with
head
down
hurled
himself
upon
everything
without
keeping
any
line
of
retreat
or
preparing
any
refuge
for
the
future
as
for
mannheim
he
was
royally
amused
by
the
farce
it
seemed
to
him
a
good
joke
to
have
introduced
this
madman
among
these
correct
people
and
he
rocked
with
laughter
both
at
the
blows
which
christophe
dealt
and
at
those
which
he
received
although
under
his
sister
influence
he
was
beginning
to
think
that
christophe
was
decidedly
a
little
cracked
he
only
liked
him
the
more
for
it
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
find
those
who
were
in
sympathy
with
him
a
little
absurd
and
so
he
joined
waldhaus
in
supporting
christophe
against
the
others
as
he
was
not
wanting
in
practical
sense
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
to
pretend
to
the
contrary
he
thought
very
justly
that
it
would
be
to
his
friend
advantage
to
ally
himself
with
the
cause
of
the
most
advanced
musical
party
in
the
country
as
in
most
german
towns
there
was
in
the
town
a
which
represented
new
ideas
against
the
conservative
in
truth
there
was
no
great
risk
in
defending
wagner
when
his
fame
was
acknowledged
everywhere
and
his
works
included
in
the
repertory
of
every
opera
house
in
germany
and
yet
his
victory
was
rather
won
by
force
than
by
universal
accord
and
at
heart
the
majority
were
obstinately
conservative
especially
in
the
small
towns
such
as
this
which
have
been
rather
left
outside
the
great
modern
movements
and
are
rather
proud
of
their
ancient
fame
more
than
anywhere
else
there
reigned
the
distrust
so
innate
in
the
german
people
of
anything
new
the
sort
of
laziness
in
feeling
anything
true
or
powerful
which
has
not
been
pondered
and
digested
by
several
generations
it
was
apparent
in
the
reluctance
with
which
if
not
the
works
of
wagner
which
are
beyond
discussion
every
new
work
inspired
by
the
wagnerian
spirit
was
accepted
and
so
the
would
have
had
a
useful
task
to
fulfil
if
they
had
set
themselves
to
defend
all
the
young
and
original
forces
in
art
sometimes
they
did
so
and
bruckner
or
hugo
wolf
found
in
some
of
them
their
best
allies
but
too
often
the
egoism
of
the
master
weighed
upon
his
disciples
and
just
as
bayreuth
serves
only
monstrously
to
glorify
one
man
the
of
bayreuth
were
little
churches
in
which
mass
was
eternally
sung
in
honor
of
the
one
god
at
the
most
the
faithful
disciples
were
admitted
to
the
side
chapels
the
disciples
who
applied
the
hallowed
doctrines
to
the
letter
and
prostrate
in
the
dust
adored
the
only
divinity
with
his
many
faces
music
poetry
drama
and
metaphysics
the
of
the
town
was
in
exactly
this
however
they
went
through
the
form
of
activity
they
were
always
trying
to
enroll
young
men
of
talent
who
looked
as
though
they
might
be
useful
to
it
and
they
had
long
had
their
eyes
on
christophe
they
had
discreetly
made
advances
to
him
of
which
christophe
had
not
taken
any
notice
because
he
felt
no
need
of
being
associated
with
anybody
he
could
not
understand
the
necessity
which
drove
his
compatriots
always
to
be
banding
themselves
together
in
groups
being
unable
to
do
anything
alone
neither
to
sing
nor
to
walk
nor
to
drink
he
was
averse
to
all
but
on
the
whole
he
was
more
kindly
disposed
to
the
than
to
any
other
at
least
they
did
provide
an
excuse
for
fine
concerts
and
although
he
did
not
share
all
the
wagnerian
ideas
on
art
he
was
much
nearer
them
than
to
those
of
any
other
group
in
music
he
could
he
thought
find
common
ground
with
a
party
which
was
as
unjust
as
himself
towards
brahms
and
the
brahmins
so
he
let
himself
be
put
up
for
it
mannheim
introduced
him
he
knew
everybody
without
being
a
musician
he
was
a
member
of
the
the
managing
committee
had
followed
the
campaign
which
christophe
was
conducting
in
the
review
his
slaughter
in
the
opposing
camp
had
seemed
to
them
to
give
signs
of
a
strong
grip
which
it
would
be
as
well
to
have
in
their
service
christophe
had
also
let
fly
certain
disrespectful
remarks
about
the
sacred
fetish
but
they
had
preferred
to
close
their
eyes
to
that
and
perhaps
his
attacks
not
yet
very
offensive
had
not
been
without
their
influence
unconsciously
in
making
them
so
eager
to
enroll
christophe
before
he
had
time
to
deliver
himself
manfully
they
came
and
very
amiably
asked
his
permission
to
play
some
of
his
compositions
at
one
of
the
approaching
concerts
of
the
association
christophe
was
flattered
and
accepted
he
went
to
the
and
urged
by
mannheim
he
was
made
a
member
at
that
time
there
were
at
the
head
of
the
two
men
of
whom
one
enjoyed
a
certain
notoriety
as
a
writer
and
the
other
as
a
conductor
both
had
a
mohammedan
belief
in
wagner
the
first
josias
kling
had
compiled
a
wagner
dictionary
which
made
it
possible
in
a
moment
to
know
the
master
thoughts
omni
re
it
had
been
his
life
work
he
was
capable
of
reciting
whole
chapters
of
it
at
table
as
the
french
provincials
used
to
troll
the
songs
of
the
maid
he
used
also
to
publish
in
the
articles
on
wagner
and
the
aryan
spirit
of
course
wagner
was
to
him
the
type
of
the
pure
aryan
of
whom
the
german
race
had
remained
the
last
inviolable
refuge
against
the
corrupting
influences
of
latin
semitism
especially
the
french
he
declared
that
the
impure
french
spirit
was
finally
destroyed
though
he
did
not
desist
from
attacking
it
bitterly
day
by
day
as
though
the
eternal
enemy
were
still
a
menace
he
would
only
acknowledge
one
great
man
in
france
the
count
of
gobineau
kling
was
a
little
man
very
little
and
he
used
to
blush
like
a
the
other
pillar
of
the
erich
lauber
had
been
manager
of
a
chemical
works
until
four
years
before
then
he
had
given
up
everything
to
become
a
conductor
he
had
succeeded
by
force
of
will
and
because
he
was
very
rich
he
was
a
bayreuth
fanatic
it
was
said
that
he
had
gone
there
on
foot
from
munich
wearing
pilgrim
sandals
it
was
a
strange
thing
that
a
man
who
had
read
much
traveled
much
practised
divers
professions
and
in
everything
displayed
an
energetic
personality
should
have
become
in
music
a
sheep
of
panurge
all
his
originality
was
expended
in
his
being
a
little
more
stupid
than
the
others
he
was
not
sure
enough
of
himself
in
music
to
trust
to
his
own
personal
feelings
and
so
he
slavishly
followed
the
interpretations
of
wagner
given
by
the
and
the
licensees
of
bayreuth
he
desired
to
reproduce
even
to
the
smallest
detail
the
setting
and
the
variegated
costumes
which
delighted
the
puerile
and
barbarous
taste
of
the
little
court
of
wahnfried
he
was
like
the
fanatical
admirer
of
michael
angelo
who
used
to
reproduce
in
his
copies
even
the
cracks
in
the
wall
of
the
moldy
patches
which
had
themselves
been
hallowed
by
their
appearance
in
the
hallowed
pictures
christophe
was
not
likely
to
approve
greatly
of
the
two
men
but
they
were
men
of
the
world
pleasant
and
both
and
lauber
conversation
was
always
interesting
on
any
other
subject
than
music
he
was
a
bit
of
a
crank
and
christophe
did
not
dislike
cranks
they
were
a
change
from
the
horrible
banality
of
reasonable
people
he
did
not
yet
know
that
there
is
nothing
more
devastating
than
an
irrational
man
and
that
originality
is
even
more
rare
among
those
who
are
called
originals
than
among
the
rest
for
these
originals
are
simply
maniacs
whose
thoughts
are
reduced
to
clockwork
josias
kling
and
lauber
being
desirous
of
winning
christophe
support
were
at
first
very
keenly
interested
in
him
kling
wrote
a
eulogistic
article
about
him
and
lauber
followed
all
his
directions
when
he
conducted
his
compositions
at
one
of
the
concerts
of
the
society
christophe
was
touched
by
it
all
unfortunately
all
their
attentions
were
spoiled
by
the
stupidity
of
those
who
paid
them
he
had
not
the
facility
of
pretending
about
people
because
they
admired
him
he
was
exacting
he
demanded
that
no
one
should
admire
him
for
the
opposite
of
what
he
was
and
he
was
always
prone
to
regard
as
enemies
those
who
were
his
friends
by
mistake
and
so
he
was
not
at
all
pleased
with
kling
for
seeing
in
him
a
disciple
of
wagner
and
trying
to
see
connections
between
passages
of
his
and
passages
of
the
which
had
nothing
in
common
but
certain
notes
of
the
scale
and
he
had
no
pleasure
in
hearing
one
of
his
works
sandwiched
together
with
a
worthless
imitation
by
a
wagnerian
student
between
two
enormous
blocks
of
wagnerian
drama
it
was
not
long
before
he
was
stifled
in
the
little
chapel
it
was
just
another
conservatoire
as
narrow
as
the
old
conservatoires
and
more
intolerant
because
it
was
the
latest
comer
in
art
christophe
began
to
lose
his
illusions
about
the
absolute
value
of
a
form
of
art
or
of
thought
hitherto
he
had
always
believed
that
great
ideas
bear
their
own
light
within
themselves
now
he
saw
that
ideas
may
change
but
that
men
remain
the
same
and
in
fine
nothing
counted
but
men
ideas
were
what
they
were
if
they
were
born
mediocre
and
servile
even
genius
became
mediocre
in
its
passage
through
their
souls
and
the
shout
of
freedom
of
the
hero
breaking
his
bonds
became
the
act
of
slavery
of
succeeding
christophe
could
mot
refrain
from
expressing
his
feelings
he
let
no
opportunity
slip
of
jeering
at
fetishism
in
art
he
declared
that
there
was
no
need
of
idols
or
classics
of
any
sort
and
that
he
only
had
the
right
to
call
himself
the
heir
of
the
spirit
of
wagner
who
was
capable
of
trampling
wagner
underfoot
and
so
walking
on
and
keeping
himself
in
close
communion
with
life
kling
stupidity
made
christophe
aggressive
he
set
out
all
the
faults
and
absurdities
he
could
see
in
wagner
the
wagnerians
at
once
credited
him
with
a
grotesque
jealousy
of
their
god
christophe
for
his
part
had
no
doubt
that
these
same
people
who
exalted
wagner
since
he
was
dead
would
have
been
the
first
to
strangle
him
in
his
life
and
he
did
them
an
injustice
the
klings
and
the
laubers
also
had
had
their
hour
of
illumination
they
had
been
advanced
twenty
years
ago
and
then
like
most
people
they
had
stopped
short
at
that
man
has
so
little
force
that
he
is
out
of
breath
after
the
first
ascent
very
few
are
enough
to
go
on
christophe
attitude
quickly
alienated
him
from
his
new
friends
their
sympathy
was
a
bargain
he
had
to
side
with
them
if
they
were
to
side
with
him
and
it
was
quite
evident
that
christophe
would
not
yield
an
inch
he
would
not
join
them
they
lost
their
enthusiasm
for
him
the
eulogies
which
he
refused
to
accord
to
the
gods
and
who
were
approved
by
the
cult
were
withheld
from
him
they
showed
less
eagerness
to
welcome
his
compositions
and
some
of
the
members
began
to
protest
against
his
name
being
too
often
on
the
programmes
they
laughed
at
him
behind
his
back
and
criticism
went
on
kling
and
lauber
by
not
protesting
seemed
to
take
part
in
it
they
would
have
avoided
a
breach
with
christophe
if
possible
first
because
the
minds
of
the
germans
of
the
rhine
like
mixed
solutions
solutions
which
are
not
solutions
and
have
the
privilege
of
prolonging
indefinitely
an
ambiguous
situation
and
secondly
because
they
hoped
in
spite
of
everything
to
be
able
to
make
use
of
him
by
wearing
him
down
if
not
by
persuasion
christophe
gave
them
no
time
for
it
whenever
he
thought
he
felt
that
at
heart
any
man
disliked
him
but
would
not
admit
it
and
tried
to
cover
it
up
so
as
to
remain
on
good
terms
with
him
he
would
never
rest
until
he
had
succeeded
in
proving
to
him
that
he
was
his
enemy
one
evening
at
the
when
he
had
come
up
against
a
wall
of
hypocritical
hostility
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
sent
in
his
resignation
to
lauber
without
wasting
words
lauber
could
not
understand
it
and
mannheim
hastened
to
christophe
to
try
and
pacify
him
at
his
first
words
christophe
burst
out
no
no
no
no
do
talk
to
me
about
these
people
i
will
not
see
them
again
i
can
not
i
can
not
i
am
disgusted
horribly
with
men
i
can
hardly
bear
to
look
at
one
mannheim
laughed
heartily
he
was
thinking
much
less
of
smoothing
christophe
down
than
of
having
the
fun
of
it
i
know
that
they
are
not
beautiful
he
said
but
that
is
nothing
new
what
new
thing
has
happened
nothing
i
have
had
enough
that
is
all
yes
laugh
laugh
at
me
everybody
knows
i
am
mad
prudent
people
act
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
logic
and
reason
and
sanity
i
am
not
like
that
i
am
a
man
who
acts
only
on
his
own
impulse
when
a
certain
quantity
of
electricity
is
accumulated
in
me
it
has
to
expend
itself
at
all
costs
and
so
much
the
worse
for
the
others
if
it
touches
them
and
so
much
the
worse
for
them
i
am
not
made
for
living
in
society
henceforth
i
shall
belong
only
to
myself
you
think
you
can
do
without
everybody
else
said
mannheim
you
can
not
play
your
music
all
by
yourself
you
need
singers
an
orchestra
a
conductor
an
audience
a
claque
christophe
shouted
no
no
no
but
the
last
word
made
him
jump
a
claque
are
you
not
ashamed
i
am
not
talking
of
a
paid
claque
although
indeed
it
is
the
only
means
yet
discovered
of
revealing
the
merit
of
a
composition
to
the
audience
but
you
must
have
a
claque
the
author
coterie
is
a
claque
properly
drilled
by
him
every
author
has
his
claque
that
is
what
friends
are
for
i
do
want
any
friends
then
you
will
be
hissed
i
want
to
be
hissed
mannheim
was
in
the
seventh
heaven
you
wo
have
even
that
pleasure
for
long
they
wo
play
you
so
be
it
then
do
you
think
i
care
about
being
a
famous
man
yes
i
was
making
for
that
with
all
my
might
nonsense
folly
idiocy
as
if
the
satisfaction
of
the
vulgarest
sort
of
pride
could
compensate
for
all
the
sacrifices
weariness
suffering
infamy
insults
degradation
ignoble
concessions
which
are
the
price
of
fame
devil
take
me
if
i
ever
bother
my
head
about
such
things
again
never
again
publicity
is
a
vulgar
infamy
i
will
be
a
private
citizen
and
live
for
myself
and
those
whom
i
love
good
said
mannheim
ironically
you
must
choose
a
profession
why
should
you
make
shoes
ah
if
i
were
a
cobbler
like
the
incomparable
sachs
cried
christophe
how
happy
my
life
would
be
a
cobbler
all
through
the
week
and
a
musician
on
sunday
privately
intimately
for
my
own
pleasure
and
that
of
my
friends
what
a
life
that
would
be
am
i
mad
to
waste
my
time
and
trouble
for
the
magnificent
pleasure
of
being
a
prey
to
the
judgment
of
idiots
is
it
not
much
better
and
finer
to
be
loved
and
understood
by
a
few
honest
men
than
to
be
heard
criticised
and
toadied
by
thousands
of
fools
the
devil
of
pride
and
thirst
for
fame
shall
never
again
take
me
trust
me
for
that
certainly
said
mannheim
he
thought
in
an
hour
he
will
say
just
the
opposite
he
remarked
quietly
then
i
am
to
go
and
smooth
things
down
with
the
christophe
waved
his
arms
what
is
the
good
of
my
shouting
myself
hoarse
with
telling
you
for
the
last
hour
i
tell
you
that
i
will
never
set
foot
inside
it
again
i
loathe
all
these
all
these
all
these
flocks
of
sheep
who
have
to
huddle
together
to
be
able
to
baa
in
unison
go
and
tell
those
sheep
from
me
that
i
am
a
wolf
that
i
have
teeth
and
am
not
made
far
the
pasture
good
good
i
will
tell
them
said
mannheim
as
he
went
he
was
delighted
with
his
morning
entertainment
he
thought
he
is
mad
mad
mad
as
a
hatter
his
sister
to
whom
he
reported
the
interview
at
once
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
said
mad
he
would
like
us
to
think
so
he
is
stupid
and
absurdly
vain
christophe
went
on
with
his
fierce
campaign
in
waldhaus
review
it
was
not
that
it
gave
him
pleasure
criticism
disgusted
him
and
he
was
always
wishing
it
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
but
he
stuck
to
it
because
people
were
trying
to
stop
him
he
did
not
wish
to
appear
to
have
given
in
waldhaus
was
beginning
to
be
uneasy
as
long
as
he
was
out
of
reach
he
had
looked
on
at
the
affray
with
the
calmness
of
an
olympian
god
but
for
some
weeks
past
the
other
papers
had
seemed
to
be
beginning
to
disregard
his
inviolability
they
had
begun
to
attack
his
vanity
as
a
writer
with
a
rare
malevolence
in
which
had
waldhaus
been
more
subtle
he
might
have
recognized
the
hand
of
a
friend
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
attacks
were
cunningly
instigated
by
ehrenfeld
and
goldenring
they
could
see
no
other
way
of
inducing
him
to
stop
christophe
polemics
their
perception
was
justified
waldhaus
at
once
declared
that
christophe
was
beginning
to
weary
him
and
he
withdrew
his
support
all
the
staff
of
the
review
then
tried
hard
to
silence
christophe
but
it
were
as
easy
to
muzzle
a
dog
who
is
about
to
devour
his
prey
everything
they
said
to
him
only
excited
him
more
he
called
them
poltroons
and
declared
that
he
would
say
everything
everything
that
he
ought
to
say
if
they
wished
to
get
rid
of
him
they
were
free
to
do
so
the
whole
town
would
know
that
they
were
as
cowardly
as
the
rest
but
he
would
not
go
of
his
own
accord
they
looked
at
each
other
in
consternation
bitterly
blaming
mannheim
for
the
trick
he
had
played
them
in
bringing
such
a
madman
among
them
mannheim
laughed
and
tried
hard
to
curb
christophe
himself
and
he
vowed
that
with
the
next
article
christophe
would
water
his
wine
they
were
incredulous
but
the
event
proved
that
mannheim
had
not
boasted
vainly
next
article
though
not
a
model
of
courtesy
did
not
contain
a
single
offensive
remark
about
anybody
mannheim
method
was
very
simple
they
were
all
amazed
at
not
having
thought
of
it
before
christophe
never
read
what
he
wrote
in
the
review
and
he
hardly
read
the
proofs
of
his
articles
only
very
quickly
and
carelessly
adolf
mai
had
more
than
once
passed
caustic
remarks
on
the
subject
he
said
that
a
printer
error
was
a
disgrace
to
a
review
and
christophe
who
did
not
regard
criticism
altogether
as
an
art
replied
that
those
who
were
upbraided
in
it
would
understand
well
enough
mannheim
turned
this
to
account
he
said
that
christophe
was
right
and
that
correcting
proofs
was
printers
work
and
he
offered
to
take
it
over
christophe
was
overwhelmed
with
gratitude
but
they
told
him
that
such
an
arrangement
would
be
of
service
to
them
and
a
saving
of
time
for
the
review
so
christophe
left
his
proofs
to
mannheim
and
asked
him
to
correct
them
carefully
mannheim
did
it
was
sport
for
him
at
first
he
only
ventured
to
tone
down
certain
phrases
and
to
delete
here
and
there
certain
ungracious
epithets
emboldened
by
success
he
went
further
with
his
experiments
he
began
to
alter
sentences
and
their
meaning
and
he
was
really
skilful
in
it
the
whole
art
of
it
consisted
in
preserving
the
general
appearance
of
the
sentence
and
its
characteristic
form
while
making
it
say
exactly
the
opposite
of
what
christophe
had
meant
mannheim
took
far
more
trouble
to
disfigure
christophe
articles
than
he
would
have
done
to
write
them
himself
never
had
he
worked
so
hard
but
he
enjoyed
the
result
certain
musicians
whom
christophe
had
hitherto
pursued
with
his
sarcasms
were
astounded
to
see
him
grow
gradually
gentle
and
at
last
sing
their
praises
the
staff
of
the
review
were
delighted
mannheim
used
to
read
aloud
his
lucubrations
to
them
they
roared
with
laughter
ehrenfeld
and
goldenring
would
say
to
mannheim
occasionally
be
careful
you
are
going
too
far
there
no
danger
mannheim
would
say
and
he
would
go
on
with
it
christophe
never
noticed
anything
he
used
to
go
to
the
office
of
the
review
leave
his
copy
and
not
bother
about
it
any
more
sometimes
he
would
take
mannheim
aside
and
say
this
time
i
really
have
done
for
the
swine
just
read
mannheim
would
read
well
what
do
you
think
of
it
terrible
my
dear
fellow
there
nothing
left
of
them
what
do
you
think
they
will
say
oh
there
will
be
a
fine
row
but
there
never
was
a
row
on
the
contrary
everybody
beamed
at
christophe
people
whom
he
detested
would
bow
to
him
in
the
street
one
day
he
came
to
the
office
uneasy
and
scowling
and
throwing
a
visiting
card
on
the
table
he
asked
what
does
this
mean
it
was
the
card
of
a
musician
whom
he
slaughtered
thousand
mannheim
replied
with
a
laugh
it
is
ironical
christophe
was
set
at
rest
oh
he
said
i
was
afraid
my
article
had
pleased
him
he
is
furious
said
ehrenfeld
but
he
does
not
wish
to
seem
so
he
is
posing
as
the
strong
man
and
is
just
laughing
laughing
swine
said
christophe
furious
once
more
i
shall
write
another
article
about
him
he
laughs
best
who
laughs
last
no
no
said
waldhaus
anxiously
i
do
think
he
is
laughing
at
you
it
is
humility
he
is
a
good
christian
he
is
holding
out
the
other
cheek
to
the
smiter
so
much
the
better
said
christophe
ah
coward
he
has
asked
for
it
he
shall
have
his
flogging
waldhaus
tried
to
intervene
but
the
others
laughed
let
him
be
said
mannheim
after
all
replied
waldhaus
suddenly
reassured
a
little
more
or
less
makes
no
matter
christophe
went
away
his
colleagues
rocked
and
roared
with
laughter
when
they
had
had
their
fill
of
it
waldhaus
said
to
mannheim
all
the
same
it
was
a
narrow
squeak
please
be
careful
we
shall
be
caught
yet
bah
said
mannheim
we
have
plenty
of
time
and
besides
i
am
making
friends
for
him
ii
engulfed
christophe
had
got
so
far
with
his
clumsy
efforts
towards
the
reform
of
german
art
when
there
happened
to
pass
through
the
town
a
troupe
of
french
actors
it
would
be
more
exact
to
say
a
band
for
as
usual
they
were
a
collection
of
poor
devils
picked
up
goodness
knows
where
and
young
unknown
players
too
happy
to
learn
their
art
provided
they
were
allowed
to
act
they
were
all
harnessed
to
the
chariot
of
a
famous
and
elderly
actress
who
was
making
tour
of
germany
and
passing
through
the
little
princely
town
gave
their
performances
there
waldhaus
review
made
a
great
fuss
over
them
mannheim
and
his
friends
knew
or
pretended
to
know
about
the
literary
and
social
life
of
paris
they
used
to
repeat
gossip
picked
up
in
the
boulevard
newspapers
and
more
or
less
understood
they
represented
the
french
spirit
in
germany
that
robbed
christophe
of
any
desire
to
know
more
about
it
mannheim
used
to
overwhelm
him
with
praises
of
paris
he
had
been
there
several
times
certain
members
of
his
family
were
there
he
had
relations
in
every
country
in
europe
and
they
had
everywhere
assumed
the
nationality
and
aspect
of
the
country
this
tribe
of
the
seed
of
abraham
included
an
english
baronet
a
belgian
senator
a
french
minister
a
deputy
in
the
and
a
papal
count
and
all
of
them
although
they
were
united
and
filled
with
respect
for
the
stock
from
which
they
sprang
were
sincerely
english
belgian
french
german
or
papal
for
their
pride
never
allowed
of
doubt
that
the
country
of
their
adoption
was
the
greatest
of
all
mannheim
was
paradoxically
the
only
one
of
them
who
was
pleased
to
prefer
all
the
countries
to
which
he
did
not
belong
he
used
often
to
talk
of
paris
enthusiastically
but
as
he
was
always
extravagant
in
his
talk
and
by
way
of
praising
the
parisians
used
to
represent
them
as
a
species
of
scatterbrains
lewd
and
rowdy
who
spent
their
time
in
and
revolutions
without
ever
taking
themselves
seriously
christophe
was
not
greatly
attracted
by
the
byzantine
and
decadent
republic
beyond
the
vosges
he
used
rather
to
imagine
paris
as
it
was
presented
in
a
naïve
engraving
which
he
had
seen
as
a
frontispiece
to
a
book
that
had
recently
appeared
in
a
german
art
publication
the
devil
of
notre
dame
appeared
huddled
up
above
the
roofs
of
the
town
with
the
legend
luxury
like
an
insatiable
vampire
devours
its
prey
above
the
great
like
a
good
german
he
despised
the
debauched
volcae
and
their
literature
of
which
he
only
knew
lively
buffooneries
like
madame
sans
and
a
few
café
songs
the
snobbishness
of
the
little
town
where
those
people
who
were
most
notoriously
incapable
of
being
interested
in
art
flocked
noisily
to
take
places
at
the
box
office
brought
him
to
an
affectation
of
scornful
indifference
towards
the
great
actress
he
vowed
that
he
would
not
go
one
yard
to
hear
her
it
was
the
easier
for
him
to
keep
his
promise
as
seats
had
reached
an
exorbitant
price
which
he
could
not
afford
the
repertory
which
the
french
actors
had
brought
included
a
few
classical
pieces
but
for
the
most
part
it
was
composed
of
those
idiotic
pieces
which
are
expressly
manufactured
in
paris
for
exportation
for
nothing
is
more
international
than
mediocrity
christophe
knew
which
was
to
be
the
first
production
of
the
touring
actors
he
had
seen
it
in
translation
adorned
with
all
those
easy
graces
which
the
company
of
a
little
rhenish
theater
can
give
to
a
french
play
and
he
laughed
scornfully
and
declared
that
he
was
very
glad
when
he
saw
his
friends
go
off
to
the
theater
not
to
have
to
see
it
again
but
next
day
he
listened
none
the
less
eagerly
without
seeming
to
listen
to
the
enthusiastic
tales
of
the
delightful
evening
they
had
had
he
was
angry
at
having
lost
the
right
to
contradict
them
by
having
refused
to
see
what
everybody
was
talking
about
the
second
production
announced
was
a
french
translation
of
christophe
had
never
missed
an
opportunity
of
seeing
a
play
of
shakespeare
shakespeare
was
to
him
of
the
same
order
as
beethoven
an
inexhaustible
spring
of
life
had
been
specially
dear
to
him
during
the
period
of
stress
and
tumultuous
doubts
through
which
he
had
just
passed
in
spite
of
his
fear
of
seeing
himself
reflected
in
that
magic
mirror
he
was
fascinated
by
it
and
he
prowled
about
the
theater
notices
though
he
did
not
admit
that
he
was
longing
to
book
a
seat
but
he
was
so
obstinate
that
after
what
he
had
said
to
his
friends
he
would
not
eat
his
words
and
he
would
have
stayed
at
home
that
evening
if
chance
had
not
brought
him
in
contact
with
mannheim
just
as
he
was
sadly
going
home
mannheim
took
his
arm
and
told
him
angrily
though
he
never
ceased
his
banter
that
an
old
beast
of
a
relation
his
father
sister
had
just
come
down
upon
them
with
all
her
retinue
and
that
they
had
all
to
stay
at
home
to
welcome
her
he
had
time
to
get
out
of
it
but
his
father
would
brook
no
trifling
with
questions
of
family
etiquette
and
the
respect
due
to
elderly
relatives
and
as
he
had
to
handle
his
father
carefully
because
he
wanted
presently
to
get
money
out
of
him
he
had
had
to
give
in
and
not
go
to
the
play
you
had
tickets
asked
christophe
an
excellent
box
and
i
have
to
go
and
give
it
i
am
just
going
now
to
that
old
pig
grünebaum
papa
partner
so
that
he
can
swagger
there
with
the
she
grünebaum
and
their
turkey
hen
of
a
daughter
jolly
i
want
to
find
something
very
disagreeable
to
say
to
them
they
wo
mind
so
long
as
i
give
them
the
tickets
although
they
would
much
rather
they
were
banknotes
he
stopped
short
with
his
month
open
and
looked
at
christophe
oh
but
but
just
the
man
i
want
he
chuckled
christophe
are
you
going
to
the
theater
no
good
you
shall
go
i
ask
it
as
a
favor
yon
can
not
refuse
christophe
did
not
understand
but
i
have
no
seat
here
you
are
said
mannheim
triumphantly
thrusting
the
ticket
into
his
hand
you
are
mad
said
christophe
what
about
your
father
orders
mannheim
laughed
he
will
be
furious
he
said
he
dried
his
eyes
and
went
on
i
shall
tap
him
morning
as
soon
as
he
is
up
before
he
knows
anything
i
can
not
accept
said
christophe
knowing
that
he
would
not
like
it
it
does
not
concern
you
you
know
nothing
about
it
christophe
had
unfolded
the
ticket
and
what
would
i
do
with
a
box
for
four
whatever
you
like
you
can
sleep
in
it
dance
if
you
like
take
some
women
you
must
know
some
if
need
be
we
can
lend
you
some
christophe
held
out
the
ticket
to
mannheim
certainly
not
take
it
back
not
i
said
mannheim
stepping
back
a
pace
i
ca
force
you
to
go
if
it
bores
you
but
i
sha
take
it
back
you
can
throw
it
in
the
fire
or
even
take
it
virtuously
to
the
grünebaums
i
do
care
he
left
christophe
in
the
middle
of
the
street
ticket
in
hand
and
went
away
christophe
was
unhappy
about
it
he
said
to
himself
that
he
ought
to
take
it
to
the
grünebaums
but
he
was
not
keen
about
the
idea
he
went
home
still
pondering
and
when
later
he
looked
at
the
clock
he
saw
that
he
had
only
just
time
enough
to
dress
for
the
theater
it
would
be
too
silly
to
waste
the
ticket
he
asked
his
mother
to
go
with
him
but
louisa
declared
that
she
would
rather
go
to
bed
he
went
at
heart
he
was
filled
with
childish
glee
at
the
thought
of
his
evening
only
one
thing
worried
him
the
thought
of
having
to
be
alone
in
such
a
pleasure
he
had
no
remorse
about
mannheim
father
or
the
grünebaums
whose
box
he
was
taking
but
he
was
remorseful
about
those
whom
he
might
have
taken
with
him
he
thought
of
the
joy
it
could
give
to
other
young
people
like
himself
and
it
hurt
him
not
to
be
able
to
give
it
them
he
cast
about
but
could
find
nobody
to
whom
he
could
offer
his
ticket
besides
it
was
late
and
he
must
hurry
as
he
entered
the
theater
he
passed
by
the
closed
window
on
which
a
poster
announced
that
there
was
not
a
single
seat
left
in
the
office
among
the
people
who
were
turning
away
from
it
disappointedly
he
noticed
a
girl
who
could
not
make
up
her
mind
to
leave
and
was
enviously
watching
the
people
going
in
she
was
dressed
very
simply
in
black
she
was
not
very
tall
her
face
was
thin
and
she
looked
delicate
and
at
the
moment
he
did
not
notice
whether
she
were
pretty
or
plain
he
passed
her
then
he
stopped
turned
and
without
stopping
to
think
you
ca
get
a
seat
fräulein
he
asked
she
blushed
and
said
with
a
foreign
accent
no
sir
i
have
a
box
which
i
do
know
what
to
do
with
will
you
make
use
of
it
with
me
she
blushed
again
and
thanked
him
and
said
she
could
not
accept
christophe
was
embarrassed
by
her
refusal
begged
her
pardon
and
tried
to
insist
but
he
could
not
persuade
her
although
it
was
obvious
that
she
was
dying
to
accept
he
was
very
perplexed
he
made
up
his
mind
suddenly
there
is
a
way
out
of
the
difficulty
he
said
you
take
the
ticket
i
do
want
it
i
have
seen
the
play
he
was
boasting
it
will
give
you
more
pleasure
than
me
take
it
please
the
girl
was
so
touched
by
his
proposal
and
the
cordial
manner
in
which
it
was
made
that
tears
all
but
came
to
her
eyes
she
murmured
gratefully
that
she
could
not
think
of
depriving
him
of
it
then
come
he
said
smiling
he
looked
so
kind
and
honest
that
she
was
ashamed
of
having
refused
and
she
said
in
some
confusion
thank
you
i
will
come
they
went
in
the
mannheims
box
was
wide
big
and
faced
the
stage
it
was
impossible
not
to
be
seen
in
it
if
they
had
wished
it
is
useless
to
say
that
their
entry
passed
unnoticed
christophe
made
the
girl
sit
at
the
front
while
he
stayed
a
little
behind
so
as
not
to
embarrass
her
she
sat
stiffly
upright
not
daring
to
turn
her
head
she
was
horribly
shy
she
would
have
given
much
not
to
have
accepted
to
give
her
time
to
recover
her
composure
and
not
knowing
what
to
talk
to
her
about
christophe
pretended
to
look
the
other
way
whichever
way
he
looked
it
was
easily
seen
that
his
presence
with
an
unknown
companion
among
the
brilliant
people
of
the
boxes
was
exciting
much
curiosity
and
comment
he
darted
furious
glances
at
those
who
were
looking
at
him
he
was
angry
that
people
should
go
on
being
interested
in
him
when
he
took
no
interest
in
them
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
their
indiscreet
curiosity
was
more
busied
with
his
companion
than
with
himself
and
that
there
was
more
offense
in
it
by
way
of
showing
his
utter
indifference
to
anything
they
might
say
or
think
he
leaned
towards
the
girl
and
began
to
talk
to
her
she
looked
so
scared
by
his
talking
and
so
unhappy
at
having
to
reply
and
it
seemed
to
be
so
difficult
for
her
to
wrench
out
a
yes
or
a
no
without
ever
daring
to
look
at
him
that
he
took
pity
on
her
shyness
and
drew
back
to
a
corner
fortunately
the
play
began
christophe
had
not
seen
the
play
bill
and
he
hardly
cared
to
know
what
part
the
great
actress
was
playing
he
was
one
of
those
simple
people
who
go
to
the
theater
to
see
the
play
and
not
the
actors
he
had
never
wondered
whether
the
famous
player
would
be
ophelia
or
the
queen
if
he
had
wondered
about
it
he
would
have
inclined
towards
the
queen
bearing
in
naiad
the
ages
of
the
two
ladies
but
it
could
never
have
occurred
to
him
that
she
would
play
hamlet
when
he
saw
hamlet
and
heard
his
mechanical
dolly
squeak
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
believe
it
he
wondered
if
he
were
not
dreaming
but
who
who
is
it
he
asked
half
aloud
it
ca
be
and
when
he
had
to
accept
that
it
hamlet
he
rapped
out
an
oath
which
fortunately
his
companion
did
not
hear
because
she
was
a
foreigner
though
it
was
heard
perfectly
in
the
next
box
for
he
was
at
once
indignantly
bidden
to
be
silent
he
withdrew
to
the
back
of
the
box
to
swear
his
fill
he
could
not
recover
his
temper
if
he
had
been
just
he
would
have
given
homage
to
the
elegance
of
the
travesty
and
the
de
of
nature
and
art
which
made
it
possible
for
a
woman
of
sixty
to
appear
in
a
youth
costume
and
even
to
seem
beautiful
in
it
at
least
to
kindly
eyes
but
he
hated
all
de
everything
which
violates
and
falsifies
nature
he
liked
a
woman
to
be
a
woman
and
a
man
a
man
it
does
not
often
happen
nowadays
the
childish
and
absurd
travesty
of
the
leonora
of
beethoven
did
not
please
him
much
but
this
travesty
of
hamlet
was
beyond
all
dreams
of
the
preposterous
to
make
of
the
robust
dane
fat
and
pale
choleric
cunning
intellectual
subject
to
hallucinations
a
woman
not
even
a
woman
for
a
woman
playing
the
man
can
only
be
a
monster
to
make
of
hamlet
a
eunuch
or
an
androgynous
betwixt
and
between
the
times
must
be
flabby
indeed
criticism
must
be
idiotic
to
let
such
disgusting
folly
be
tolerated
for
a
single
day
and
not
hissed
off
the
boards
the
actress
voice
infuriated
christophe
she
had
that
singing
labored
diction
that
monotonous
melopoeia
which
seems
to
have
been
dear
to
the
least
poetic
people
in
the
world
since
the
days
of
the
and
the
de
christophe
was
so
exasperated
by
it
that
he
wanted
to
go
away
he
turned
his
back
on
the
scene
and
he
made
hideous
faces
against
the
wall
of
the
box
like
a
child
put
in
the
corner
fortunately
his
companion
dared
not
look
at
him
for
if
she
had
seen
him
she
would
have
thought
him
mad
suddenly
christophe
stopped
making
faces
he
stopped
still
and
made
no
sound
a
lovely
musical
voice
a
young
woman
voice
grave
and
sweet
was
heard
christophe
pricked
his
ears
as
she
went
on
with
her
words
he
turned
again
keenly
interested
to
see
what
bird
could
warble
so
he
saw
ophelia
in
truth
she
was
nothing
like
the
ophelia
of
shakespeare
she
was
a
beautiful
girl
tall
big
and
fine
like
a
young
fresh
statue
electra
or
cassandra
she
was
brimming
with
life
in
spite
of
her
efforts
to
keep
within
her
part
the
force
of
youth
and
joy
that
was
in
her
shone
forth
from
her
body
her
movements
her
gestures
her
brown
eyes
that
laughed
in
spite
of
herself
such
is
the
power
of
physical
beauty
that
christophe
who
a
moment
before
had
been
merciless
in
judging
the
interpretation
of
hamlet
never
for
a
moment
thought
of
regretting
that
ophelia
was
hardly
at
all
like
his
image
of
her
and
he
sacrificed
his
image
to
the
present
vision
of
her
remorselessly
with
the
unconscious
faithlessness
of
people
of
passion
he
even
found
a
profound
truth
in
the
youthful
ardor
brimming
in
the
depths
of
the
chaste
and
unhappy
virgin
heart
but
the
magic
of
the
voice
pure
warm
and
velvety
worked
the
spell
every
word
sounded
like
a
lovely
chord
about
every
syllable
there
hovered
like
the
scent
of
thyme
or
wild
mint
the
laughing
accent
of
the
midi
with
its
full
rhythm
strange
was
this
vision
of
an
ophelia
from
arles
in
it
was
something
of
that
golden
sun
and
its
wild
northwest
wind
its
christophe
forgot
his
companion
and
came
and
sat
by
her
side
at
the
front
of
the
box
he
never
took
his
eyes
off
the
beautiful
actress
whose
name
he
did
not
know
but
the
audience
who
had
not
come
to
see
an
unknown
player
paid
no
attention
to
her
and
only
applauded
when
the
female
hamlet
spoke
that
made
christophe
growl
and
call
them
idiots
in
a
low
voice
which
could
be
heard
ten
yards
away
it
was
not
until
the
curtain
was
lowered
upon
the
first
act
that
he
remembered
the
existence
of
his
companion
and
seeing
that
she
was
still
shy
he
thought
with
a
smile
of
how
he
must
have
scared
her
with
his
extravagances
he
was
not
far
wrong
the
girl
whom
chance
had
thrown
in
his
company
for
a
few
hours
was
almost
morbidly
shy
she
must
have
been
in
an
abnormal
state
of
excitement
to
have
accepted
christophe
invitation
she
had
hardly
accepted
it
than
she
had
wished
at
any
cost
to
get
out
of
it
to
make
some
excuse
and
to
escape
it
had
been
much
worse
for
her
when
she
had
seen
that
she
was
an
object
of
general
curiosity
and
her
unhappiness
had
been
increased
almost
past
endurance
when
she
heard
behind
her
back
she
dared
not
turn
round
her
companion
low
growls
and
imprecations
she
expected
anything
now
and
when
he
came
and
sat
by
her
she
was
frozen
with
terror
what
eccentricity
would
he
commit
next
she
would
gladly
have
sunk
into
the
ground
fathoms
down
she
drew
back
instinctively
she
was
afraid
of
touching
him
but
all
her
fears
vanished
when
the
interval
came
and
she
heard
him
say
quite
kindly
i
am
an
unpleasant
companion
eh
i
beg
your
pardon
then
she
looked
at
him
and
saw
his
kind
smile
which
had
induced
her
to
come
with
him
he
went
on
i
can
not
hide
what
i
think
but
you
know
it
is
too
much
that
woman
that
old
woman
he
made
a
face
of
disgust
she
smiled
and
said
in
a
low
voice
it
is
fine
in
spite
of
everything
he
noticed
her
accent
and
asked
you
are
a
foreigner
yes
said
she
he
looked
at
her
modest
gown
a
governess
he
said
yes
what
nationality
she
said
i
am
french
he
made
a
gesture
of
surprise
french
i
should
not
have
thought
it
why
she
asked
timidly
you
are
so
serious
said
he
she
thought
it
was
not
altogether
a
compliment
from
him
there
are
serious
people
also
in
france
said
she
confusedly
he
looked
at
her
honest
little
face
with
its
broad
forehead
little
straight
nose
delicate
chin
and
thin
cheeks
framed
in
her
chestnut
hair
it
was
not
she
that
he
saw
he
was
thinking
of
the
beautiful
actress
he
repeated
it
is
strange
that
you
should
be
french
are
you
really
of
the
same
nationality
as
ophelia
one
would
never
think
it
after
a
moment
silence
he
went
on
how
beautiful
she
is
without
noticing
that
he
seemed
to
be
making
a
comparison
between
the
actress
and
his
companion
that
was
not
at
all
flattering
to
her
but
she
felt
it
but
she
did
not
mind
for
she
was
of
the
same
opinion
he
tried
to
find
out
about
the
actress
from
her
but
she
knew
nothing
it
was
plain
that
she
did
not
know
much
about
the
theater
you
must
be
glad
to
hear
french
he
asked
he
meant
it
in
jest
but
he
touched
her
ah
she
said
with
an
accent
of
sincerity
which
struck
him
it
does
me
so
much
good
i
am
stifled
here
he
looked
at
her
more
closely
she
clasped
her
hands
and
seemed
to
be
oppressed
but
at
once
she
thought
of
how
her
words
might
hurt
him
forgive
me
she
said
i
do
know
what
i
am
saying
he
laughed
do
beg
pardon
you
are
quite
right
you
do
need
to
be
french
to
be
stifled
here
ouf
he
threw
back
his
shoulders
and
took
a
long
breath
but
she
was
ashamed
of
having
been
so
free
and
relapsed
into
silence
besides
she
had
just
seen
that
the
people
in
the
boxes
next
to
them
were
listening
to
what
they
were
saying
he
noticed
it
too
and
was
wrathful
they
broke
off
and
until
the
end
of
the
interval
he
went
out
into
the
corridor
the
girl
words
were
ringing
in
his
ears
but
he
was
lost
in
dreams
the
image
of
ophelia
filled
his
thoughts
during
the
succeeding
acts
she
took
hold
of
him
completely
and
when
the
beautiful
actress
came
to
the
mad
scene
and
the
melancholy
songs
of
love
and
death
her
voice
gave
forth
notes
so
moving
that
he
was
bowled
over
he
felt
that
he
was
going
to
burst
into
tears
angry
with
himself
for
what
he
took
to
be
a
sign
of
weakness
for
he
would
not
admit
that
a
true
artist
can
weep
and
not
wishing
to
make
an
object
of
himself
he
left
the
box
abruptly
the
corridors
and
the
foyer
were
empty
in
his
agitation
he
went
down
the
stairs
of
the
theater
and
went
out
without
knowing
it
he
had
to
breathe
the
cold
night
air
and
to
go
striding
through
the
dark
streets
he
came
to
himself
by
the
edge
of
a
canal
and
leaned
on
the
parapet
of
the
bank
and
watched
the
silent
water
whereon
the
reflections
of
the
street
lamps
danced
in
the
darkness
his
soul
was
like
that
it
was
dark
and
heaving
he
could
see
nothing
in
it
but
great
joy
dancing
on
the
surface
the
clocks
rang
the
hour
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
go
back
to
the
theater
and
hear
the
end
of
the
play
to
see
the
triumph
of
fortinbras
no
that
did
not
tempt
him
a
fine
triumph
that
who
thinks
of
envying
the
conqueror
who
would
be
he
after
being
gorged
with
all
the
wild
and
absurd
savagery
of
life
the
whole
play
is
a
formidable
indictment
of
life
but
there
is
such
a
power
of
life
in
it
that
sadness
becomes
joy
and
bitterness
intoxicates
christophe
went
home
without
a
thought
for
the
unknown
girl
whose
name
even
he
had
not
ascertained
next
morning
he
went
to
see
the
actress
at
the
little
hotel
in
which
the
impresario
had
quartered
her
with
her
comrades
while
the
great
actress
had
put
up
at
the
best
hotel
in
the
town
he
was
conducted
to
a
very
untidy
room
where
the
remains
of
breakfast
were
left
on
an
open
piano
together
with
hairpins
and
torn
and
dirty
sheets
of
music
in
the
next
room
ophelia
was
singing
at
the
top
of
her
voice
like
a
child
for
the
pleasure
of
making
a
noise
she
stopped
for
a
moment
when
her
visitor
was
announced
to
ask
merrily
in
a
loud
voice
without
ever
caring
whether
she
were
heard
through
the
wall
what
does
he
want
what
is
his
name
christophe
christophe
what
christophe
krafft
what
a
name
she
repeated
it
two
or
three
times
rolling
her
terribly
it
is
like
a
swear
she
swore
is
he
young
or
old
pleasant
very
well
i
come
she
began
to
sing
again
is
sweeter
than
my
while
she
rushed
about
her
room
cursing
a
pin
which
had
got
lost
in
all
the
rubbish
she
lost
patience
began
to
grumble
and
roared
although
he
could
not
see
her
christophe
followed
all
her
movements
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
in
imagination
and
laughed
to
himself
at
last
he
heard
steps
approaching
the
door
was
flung
open
and
ophelia
appeared
she
was
half
dressed
in
a
loose
gown
which
she
was
holding
about
her
waist
her
bare
arms
showed
in
her
wide
sleeves
her
hair
was
carelessly
done
and
locks
of
it
fell
down
into
her
eyes
and
over
her
cheeks
her
fine
brown
eyes
smiled
her
lips
smiled
her
cheeks
smiled
and
a
charming
dimple
in
her
chin
smiled
in
her
beautiful
grave
melodious
voice
she
asked
him
to
excuse
her
appearance
she
knew
that
there
was
nothing
to
excuse
and
that
he
could
only
be
very
grateful
to
her
for
it
she
thought
he
was
a
journalist
come
to
interview
her
instead
of
being
annoyed
when
he
told
her
that
he
had
come
to
her
entirely
of
his
own
accord
and
because
he
admired
her
she
was
delighted
she
was
a
good
girl
affectionate
delighted
to
please
and
making
no
effort
to
conceal
her
delight
christophe
visit
and
his
enthusiasm
made
her
very
happy
she
was
not
yet
spoiled
by
flattery
she
was
so
natural
in
all
her
movements
and
ways
even
in
her
little
vanities
and
her
naïve
delight
in
giving
pleasure
that
he
was
not
embarrassed
for
a
single
moment
they
became
old
friends
at
once
he
could
jabber
a
few
words
of
french
and
she
could
jabber
a
few
words
of
german
after
an
hour
they
told
each
other
all
their
secrets
she
never
thought
of
sending
him
away
the
splendid
gay
southern
creature
intelligent
and
who
would
have
been
bored
to
tears
with
her
stupid
companions
and
in
a
country
whose
language
she
did
not
know
a
country
without
the
natural
joy
that
was
in
herself
was
glad
to
find
some
one
to
talk
to
as
for
christophe
it
was
an
untold
blessing
for
him
to
meet
the
girl
of
the
midi
filled
with
the
life
of
the
people
in
the
midst
of
his
narrow
and
insincere
fellow
citizens
he
did
not
yet
know
the
workings
of
such
natures
which
unlike
the
germans
have
no
more
in
their
minds
and
hearts
than
they
show
and
often
not
even
as
much
but
at
the
least
she
was
young
she
was
alive
she
said
frankly
rawly
what
she
thought
she
judged
everything
freely
from
a
new
and
a
fresh
point
of
view
in
her
it
was
possible
to
breathe
a
little
of
the
northwest
wind
that
sweeps
away
mists
she
was
gifted
uneducated
and
unthinking
she
could
at
once
feel
with
her
whole
heart
and
be
sincerely
moved
by
things
which
were
beautiful
and
good
and
then
a
moment
later
she
would
burst
out
laughing
she
was
a
coquette
and
made
eyes
she
did
not
mind
showing
her
bare
arms
and
neck
under
her
half
open
gown
she
would
have
liked
to
turn
christophe
head
but
it
was
all
purely
instinctive
there
was
no
thought
of
gaining
her
own
ends
in
her
and
she
much
preferred
to
laugh
and
talk
blithely
to
be
a
good
fellow
a
good
chum
without
ceremony
or
awkwardness
she
told
him
about
the
underworld
of
the
theater
her
little
sorrows
the
silly
susceptibilities
of
her
comrades
the
bickerings
of
jezebel
so
she
called
the
great
actress
who
took
good
care
not
to
let
her
shine
he
confided
his
sufferings
at
the
hands
of
the
germans
she
clapped
her
hands
and
played
chords
to
him
she
was
kind
and
would
not
speak
ill
of
anybody
but
that
did
not
keep
her
from
doing
so
and
while
she
blamed
herself
for
her
malice
when
she
laughed
at
anybody
she
had
a
fund
of
mocking
humor
and
that
realistic
and
witty
gift
of
observation
which
belongs
to
the
people
of
the
south
she
could
not
resist
it
and
drew
cuttingly
satirical
portraits
with
her
pale
lips
she
laughed
merrily
to
show
her
teeth
like
those
of
a
puppy
and
dark
eyes
shone
in
her
pale
face
which
was
a
little
discolored
by
grease
paint
they
noticed
suddenly
that
they
had
been
talking
for
more
than
an
hour
christophe
proposed
to
come
for
corinne
that
was
her
stage
name
in
the
afternoon
and
show
her
over
the
town
she
was
delighted
with
the
idea
and
they
arranged
to
meet
immediately
after
dinner
at
the
appointed
hour
he
turned
up
corinne
was
sitting
in
the
little
of
the
hotel
with
a
book
in
her
hand
which
she
was
reading
aloud
she
greeted
him
with
smiling
eyes
but
did
not
stop
reading
until
she
had
finished
her
sentence
then
she
signed
to
him
to
sit
down
on
the
sofa
by
her
side
sit
there
she
said
and
do
talk
i
am
going
over
my
part
i
shall
have
finished
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
followed
the
script
with
her
finger
nail
and
read
quickly
and
carelessly
like
a
little
girl
in
a
hurry
he
offered
to
hear
her
her
words
she
passed
him
the
book
and
got
up
to
repeat
what
she
had
learned
she
floundered
and
would
repeat
the
end
of
one
sentence
four
times
before
going
on
to
the
next
she
shook
her
head
as
she
recited
her
part
her
fell
down
and
all
over
the
room
when
she
could
not
recollect
sometimes
some
word
she
was
as
impatient
as
a
naughty
child
sometimes
she
swore
comically
or
she
would
use
big
words
one
word
with
which
she
apostrophized
herself
was
very
big
and
very
short
christophe
was
astonished
by
the
mixture
of
talent
and
childishness
in
her
she
would
produce
moving
tones
of
voice
quite
aptly
but
in
the
middle
of
a
speech
into
which
she
seemed
to
be
throwing
her
whole
heart
she
would
say
a
whole
string
of
words
that
had
absolutely
no
meaning
she
recited
her
lesson
like
a
parrot
without
troubling
about
its
meaning
and
then
she
produced
burlesque
nonsense
she
did
not
worry
about
it
when
she
saw
it
she
would
shout
with
laughter
at
last
she
said
zut
snatched
the
book
from
him
flung
it
into
a
corner
of
the
room
and
said
holidays
the
hour
has
struck
now
let
us
go
out
he
was
a
little
anxious
about
her
part
and
asked
you
think
you
will
know
it
she
replied
confidently
certainly
what
is
the
prompter
for
she
went
into
her
room
to
put
on
her
hat
christophe
sat
at
the
piano
while
he
was
waiting
for
her
and
struck
a
few
chords
from
the
next
room
she
called
oh
what
is
that
play
some
more
how
pretty
it
is
she
ran
in
pinning
on
her
hat
he
went
on
when
he
had
finished
she
wanted
him
to
play
more
she
went
into
ecstasies
with
all
the
little
arch
exclamations
habitual
to
frenchwomen
which
they
make
about
and
a
cup
of
chocolate
equally
it
made
christophe
laugh
it
was
a
change
from
the
tremendous
affected
clumsy
exclamations
of
the
germans
they
were
both
exaggerated
in
different
directions
one
made
a
mountain
out
of
a
the
other
made
a
out
of
a
mountain
the
french
was
not
less
ridiculous
than
the
german
but
for
the
moment
it
seemed
more
pleasant
because
he
loved
the
lips
from
which
it
came
corinne
wanted
to
know
what
he
was
playing
and
when
she
learned
that
he
had
composed
it
she
gave
a
shout
he
had
told
her
during
their
conversation
in
the
morning
that
he
was
a
composer
but
she
had
hardly
listened
to
him
she
sat
by
him
and
insisted
on
his
playing
everything
that
he
had
composed
their
walk
was
forgotten
it
was
not
mere
politeness
on
her
part
she
adored
music
and
had
an
admirable
instinct
for
it
which
supplied
the
deficiencies
of
her
education
at
first
he
did
not
take
her
seriously
and
played
his
easiest
melodies
but
when
he
had
played
a
passage
by
which
he
set
more
store
and
saw
that
she
preferred
it
too
although
he
had
not
said
anything
about
it
he
was
joyfully
surprised
with
the
naïve
astonishment
of
the
germans
when
they
meet
a
frenchman
who
is
a
good
musician
he
said
odd
how
good
your
taste
is
i
should
never
have
thought
it
corinne
laughed
in
his
face
he
amused
himself
then
by
selecting
compositions
more
and
more
difficult
to
understand
to
see
how
far
she
would
go
with
him
but
she
did
not
seem
to
be
put
out
by
his
boldness
and
after
a
particularly
new
melody
which
christophe
himself
had
almost
come
to
doubt
because
he
had
never
succeeded
in
having
it
accepted
in
germany
he
was
greatly
astonished
when
corinne
begged
him
to
play
it
again
and
she
got
up
and
began
to
sing
the
notes
from
memory
almost
without
a
mistake
he
turned
towards
her
and
took
her
hands
warmly
but
you
are
a
musician
he
cried
she
began
to
laugh
and
explained
that
she
had
made
her
début
as
a
singer
in
provincial
opera
houses
but
that
an
impresario
of
touring
companies
had
recognized
her
disposition
towards
the
poetic
theater
and
had
enrolled
her
in
its
services
he
exclaimed
what
a
pity
why
said
she
poetry
also
is
a
sort
of
music
she
made
him
explain
to
her
the
meaning
of
his
he
told
her
the
german
words
and
she
repeated
them
with
easy
mimicry
copying
even
the
movements
of
his
lips
and
eyes
as
he
pronounced
the
words
when
she
had
these
to
sing
from
memory
then
she
made
grotesque
mistakes
and
when
she
forgot
she
invented
words
guttural
and
barbarously
sonorous
which
made
them
both
laugh
she
did
not
tire
of
making
him
play
nor
he
of
playing
for
her
and
hearing
her
pretty
voice
she
did
not
know
the
tricks
of
the
trade
and
sang
a
little
from
the
throat
like
little
girls
and
there
was
a
curious
fragile
quality
in
her
voice
that
was
very
touching
she
told
him
frankly
what
she
thought
although
she
could
not
explain
why
she
liked
or
disliked
anything
there
was
always
some
grain
of
sense
hidden
in
her
judgment
the
odd
thing
was
that
she
found
least
pleasure
in
the
most
classical
passages
which
were
most
appreciated
in
germany
she
paid
him
a
few
compliments
out
of
politeness
but
they
obviously
meant
nothing
as
she
had
no
musical
culture
she
had
not
the
pleasure
which
amateurs
and
even
artists
find
in
what
is
a
pleasure
which
often
makes
them
unconsciously
reproduce
or
in
a
new
composition
like
forms
or
formulæ
which
they
have
already
used
in
old
compositions
nor
did
she
have
the
german
taste
for
melodious
sentimentality
or
at
least
her
sentimentality
was
different
christophe
did
not
yet
know
its
failings
she
did
not
go
into
ecstasies
over
the
soft
insipid
music
preferred
in
germany
she
did
not
single
out
the
most
melodious
of
his
a
melody
which
he
would
have
liked
to
destroy
because
his
friends
only
too
glad
to
be
able
to
compliment
him
on
something
were
always
talking
about
it
dramatic
instinct
made
her
prefer
the
melodies
which
frankly
reproduced
a
certain
passion
he
also
set
most
store
by
them
and
yet
she
did
not
hesitate
to
show
her
lack
of
sympathy
with
certain
rude
harmonies
which
seemed
quite
natural
to
christophe
they
gave
her
a
sort
of
shock
when
she
came
upon
them
she
would
stop
then
and
ask
if
it
was
really
so
when
he
said
yes
then
she
would
rush
at
the
difficulty
but
she
would
make
a
little
grimace
which
did
not
escape
christophe
sometimes
even
she
would
prefer
to
skip
the
bar
then
he
would
play
it
again
on
the
piano
you
do
like
that
he
would
ask
she
would
screw
up
her
nose
it
is
wrong
she
would
say
not
at
all
he
would
reply
with
a
laugh
it
is
quite
right
think
of
its
meaning
it
is
rhythmic
is
it
he
pointed
to
her
heart
but
she
would
shake
her
head
may
be
but
it
is
wrong
here
she
pulled
her
ear
and
she
would
be
a
little
shocked
by
the
sudden
outbursts
of
german
declamation
why
should
he
talk
so
loud
she
would
ask
he
is
all
alone
are
you
afraid
of
his
neighbors
overhearing
him
it
is
as
though
forgive
me
you
wo
be
angry
he
were
hailing
a
boat
he
was
not
angry
he
laughed
heartily
he
recognized
that
there
was
some
truth
in
what
she
said
her
remarks
amused
him
nobody
had
ever
said
such
things
before
they
agreed
that
declamation
in
singing
generally
deforms
the
natural
word
like
a
magnifying
glass
corinne
asked
christophe
to
write
music
for
a
piece
in
which
she
would
speak
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
orchestra
singing
a
few
sentences
every
now
and
then
he
was
fired
by
the
idea
in
spite
of
the
difficulties
of
the
stage
setting
which
he
thought
corinne
musical
voice
would
easily
overcome
and
they
made
plans
for
the
future
it
was
not
far
short
of
five
when
they
thought
of
going
out
night
fell
early
they
could
not
think
of
going
for
a
walk
corinne
had
a
rehearsal
at
the
theater
in
the
evening
nobody
was
allowed
to
be
present
she
made
him
promise
to
come
and
fetch
her
during
the
next
afternoon
to
take
the
walk
they
had
planned
next
day
they
did
almost
the
same
again
he
found
corinne
in
front
of
her
mirror
perched
on
a
high
stool
swinging
her
legs
she
was
trying
on
a
wig
her
dresser
was
there
and
a
hair
dresser
of
the
town
to
whom
she
was
giving
instructions
about
a
curl
which
she
wished
to
have
higher
up
as
she
looked
in
the
glass
she
saw
christophe
smiling
behind
her
back
she
put
out
her
tongue
at
him
the
hair
dresser
went
away
with
the
wig
and
she
turned
gaily
to
christophe
my
friend
she
said
she
held
up
her
cheek
to
be
kissed
he
had
not
expected
such
intimacy
but
he
took
advantage
of
it
all
the
same
she
did
not
attach
so
much
importance
to
the
favor
it
was
to
her
a
greeting
like
any
other
oh
i
am
happy
said
she
it
will
do
very
well
she
was
talking
of
her
wig
i
was
so
wretched
if
you
had
come
this
morning
you
would
have
found
me
absolutely
miserable
he
asked
why
it
was
because
the
parisian
hair
dresser
had
made
a
mistake
in
packing
and
had
sent
a
wig
which
was
not
suitable
to
the
part
quite
flat
she
said
and
falling
straight
down
when
i
saw
it
i
wept
like
a
magdalen
did
i
désirée
when
i
came
in
said
désirée
i
was
afraid
for
madame
madame
was
quite
white
madame
looked
like
death
christophe
laughed
corinne
saw
him
in
her
mirror
heartless
wretch
it
makes
you
laugh
she
said
indignantly
she
began
to
laugh
too
he
asked
her
how
the
rehearsal
had
gone
everything
had
gone
off
well
she
would
have
liked
the
other
parts
to
be
cut
more
and
her
own
less
they
talked
so
much
that
they
wasted
part
of
the
afternoon
she
dressed
slowly
she
amused
herself
by
asking
christophe
opinion
about
her
dresses
christophe
praised
her
elegance
and
told
her
naïvely
in
his
jargon
that
he
had
never
seen
anybody
so
luxurious
she
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
and
then
burst
out
laughing
what
have
i
said
he
asked
have
i
said
anything
wrong
yes
yes
she
cried
rocking
with
laughter
you
have
indeed
at
last
they
went
out
her
striking
costume
and
her
exuberant
chatter
attracted
attention
she
looked
at
everything
with
her
mocking
eyes
and
made
no
effort
to
conceal
her
impressions
she
chuckled
at
the
shops
and
at
the
picture
shops
in
which
sentimental
scenes
comic
and
obscene
drawings
the
town
prostitutes
the
imperial
family
the
emperor
as
a
holding
the
wheel
of
the
and
defying
the
heavens
were
all
thrown
together
she
giggled
at
a
decoration
with
wagner
face
or
at
a
hair
dresser
in
which
there
was
the
wax
head
of
a
man
she
made
no
attempt
to
modify
her
hilarity
over
the
patriotic
monument
representing
the
old
emperor
in
a
traveling
coat
and
a
peaked
cap
together
with
prussia
the
german
states
and
a
nude
genius
of
war
she
made
remarks
about
anything
in
the
faces
of
the
people
or
their
way
of
speaking
that
struck
her
as
funny
her
victims
were
left
in
no
doubt
about
it
as
she
maliciously
picked
out
their
absurdities
her
instinctive
mimicry
made
her
sometimes
imitate
with
her
mouth
and
nose
their
broad
grimaces
and
frowns
without
thinking
and
she
would
blow
out
her
cheeks
as
she
repeated
fragments
of
sentences
and
words
that
struck
her
as
grotesque
in
sound
as
she
caught
them
he
laughed
heartily
and
was
not
at
all
embarrassed
by
her
impertinence
for
he
was
no
longer
easily
embarrassed
fortunately
he
had
no
great
reputation
to
lose
or
his
walk
would
have
ruined
it
for
ever
they
visited
the
cathedral
corinne
wanted
to
go
to
the
top
of
the
spire
in
spite
of
her
high
heels
and
long
dress
which
swept
the
stairs
or
was
caught
in
a
corner
of
the
staircase
she
did
not
worry
about
it
but
pulled
the
stuff
which
split
and
went
on
climbing
holding
it
up
she
wanted
very
much
to
ring
the
bells
from
the
top
of
the
tower
she
declaimed
victor
hugo
he
did
not
understand
it
and
sang
a
popular
french
song
after
that
she
played
the
muezzin
dusk
was
falling
they
went
down
into
the
cathedral
where
the
dark
shadows
were
creeping
along
the
gigantic
walls
in
which
the
magic
eyes
of
the
windows
were
shining
kneeling
in
one
of
the
side
chapels
christophe
saw
the
girl
who
had
shared
his
box
at
she
was
so
absorbed
in
her
prayers
that
she
did
not
see
him
he
saw
that
she
was
looking
sad
and
strained
he
would
have
liked
to
speak
to
her
just
to
say
how
do
you
do
but
corinne
dragged
him
off
like
a
whirlwind
they
parted
soon
afterwards
she
had
to
get
ready
for
the
performance
which
began
early
as
usual
in
germany
he
had
hardly
reached
home
when
there
was
a
ring
at
the
door
and
a
letter
from
corinne
was
handed
in
luck
jezebel
ill
no
performance
no
school
come
let
us
dine
together
your
friend
corinette
bring
plenty
of
music
it
was
some
time
before
he
understood
when
he
did
understand
he
was
as
happy
as
corinne
and
went
to
the
hotel
at
once
he
was
afraid
of
finding
the
whole
company
assembled
at
dinner
but
he
saw
nobody
corinne
herself
was
not
there
at
last
he
heard
her
laughing
voice
at
the
back
of
the
house
he
went
to
look
for
her
and
found
her
in
the
kitchen
she
had
taken
it
into
her
head
to
cook
a
dish
in
her
own
way
one
of
those
southern
dishes
which
fills
the
whole
neighborhood
with
its
aroma
and
would
awaken
a
stone
she
was
on
excellent
terms
with
the
large
proprietress
of
the
hotel
and
they
were
jabbering
in
a
horrible
jargon
that
was
a
mixture
of
german
french
and
negro
though
there
is
no
word
to
describe
it
in
any
language
they
were
laughing
loudly
and
making
each
other
taste
their
cooking
christophe
appearance
made
them
noisier
than
ever
they
tried
to
push
him
out
but
he
struggled
and
succeeded
in
tasting
the
famous
dish
he
made
a
face
she
said
he
was
a
barbarous
teuton
and
that
it
was
no
use
putting
herself
out
for
him
they
went
up
to
the
little
when
the
table
was
laid
there
were
only
two
places
for
himself
and
corinne
he
could
not
help
asking
her
where
her
companions
were
corinne
waved
her
hands
carelessly
i
do
know
do
you
sup
together
never
we
see
enough
of
each
other
at
the
theater
and
it
would
be
awful
if
we
had
to
meet
at
meals
it
was
so
different
from
german
custom
that
he
was
surprised
and
charmed
by
it
i
thought
he
said
you
were
a
sociable
people
well
said
she
am
i
not
sociable
sociable
means
living
in
society
we
have
to
see
each
other
men
women
children
we
all
belong
to
societies
from
birth
to
death
we
are
always
making
societies
we
eat
sing
think
in
societies
when
the
societies
sneeze
we
sneeze
too
we
do
have
a
drink
except
with
our
societies
that
must
be
amusing
said
she
why
not
out
of
the
same
glass
brotherly
is
it
that
for
fraternity
i
like
being
with
people
i
like
not
with
the
others
pooh
that
not
society
that
is
an
ant
heap
well
you
can
imagine
how
happy
i
am
here
for
i
think
as
you
do
come
to
us
then
he
asked
nothing
better
he
questioned
her
about
paris
and
the
french
she
told
him
much
that
was
not
perfectly
accurate
her
southern
propensity
for
boasting
was
mixed
with
an
instinctive
desire
to
shine
before
him
according
to
her
everybody
in
paris
was
free
and
as
everybody
in
paris
was
intelligent
everybody
made
good
use
of
their
liberty
and
no
one
abused
it
everybody
did
what
they
liked
thought
believed
loved
or
did
not
love
as
they
liked
nobody
had
anything
to
say
about
it
there
nobody
meddled
with
other
people
beliefs
or
spied
on
their
consciences
or
tried
to
regulate
their
thoughts
there
politicians
never
dabbled
in
literature
or
the
arts
and
never
gave
orders
jobs
and
money
to
their
friends
or
clients
there
little
cliques
never
disposed
of
reputation
or
success
journalists
were
never
bought
there
men
of
letters
never
entered
into
controversies
with
the
church
that
could
lead
to
nothing
there
criticism
never
stifled
unknown
talent
or
exhausted
its
praises
upon
recognized
talent
there
success
success
at
all
costs
did
not
justify
the
means
and
command
the
adoration
of
the
public
there
were
only
gentle
manners
kindly
and
sweet
there
was
never
any
bitterness
never
any
scandal
everybody
helped
everybody
else
every
worthy
newcomer
was
certain
to
find
hands
held
out
to
him
and
the
way
made
smooth
for
him
pure
love
of
beauty
filled
the
chivalrous
and
disinterested
souls
of
the
french
and
they
were
only
absurd
in
their
idealism
which
in
spite
of
their
acknowledged
wit
made
them
the
dupes
of
other
nations
christophe
listened
it
was
certainly
marvelous
corinne
marveled
herself
as
she
heard
her
words
she
had
forgotten
what
she
had
told
christophe
the
day
before
about
the
difficulties
of
her
past
life
he
gave
no
more
thought
to
it
than
she
and
yet
corinne
was
not
only
concerned
with
making
the
germans
love
her
country
she
wanted
to
make
herself
loved
too
a
whole
evening
without
flirtation
would
have
seemed
austere
and
rather
absurd
to
her
she
made
eyes
at
christophe
but
it
was
trouble
wasted
he
did
not
notice
it
christophe
did
not
know
what
it
was
to
flirt
he
loved
or
did
not
love
when
he
did
not
love
he
was
miles
from
any
thought
of
love
he
liked
corinne
enormously
he
felt
the
attraction
of
her
southern
nature
it
was
so
new
to
him
and
her
sweetness
and
good
humor
her
quick
and
lively
intelligence
many
more
reasons
than
he
needed
for
loving
but
the
spirit
blows
where
it
listeth
it
did
not
blow
in
that
direction
and
as
for
playing
at
love
in
love
absence
the
idea
had
never
occurred
to
him
corinne
was
amused
by
his
coldness
she
sat
by
his
side
at
the
piano
while
he
played
the
music
he
had
brought
with
him
and
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
and
to
follow
the
music
she
leaned
towards
the
keyboard
almost
pressing
her
cheek
against
his
he
felt
her
hair
touch
his
face
and
quite
close
to
him
saw
the
corner
of
her
mocking
eye
her
pretty
little
mouth
and
the
light
down
on
her
nose
she
waited
smiling
she
waited
christophe
did
not
understand
the
invitation
corinne
was
in
his
way
that
was
all
he
thought
of
mechanically
he
broke
free
from
her
and
moved
his
chair
and
when
a
moment
later
he
turned
to
speak
to
corinne
he
saw
that
she
was
choking
with
laughter
her
cheeks
were
dimpled
her
lips
were
pressed
together
and
she
seemed
to
be
holding
herself
in
what
is
the
matter
he
said
in
his
astonishment
she
looked
at
him
and
laughed
aloud
he
did
not
understand
why
are
you
laughing
he
asked
did
i
say
anything
funny
the
more
he
insisted
the
more
she
laughed
when
she
had
almost
finished
she
had
only
to
look
at
his
crestfallen
appearance
to
break
out
again
she
got
up
ran
to
the
sofa
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
buried
her
face
in
the
cushions
to
laugh
her
fill
her
whole
body
shook
with
it
he
began
to
laugh
too
came
towards
her
and
slapped
her
on
the
back
when
she
had
done
laughing
she
raised
her
head
dried
the
tears
in
her
eyes
and
held
out
her
hands
to
him
what
a
good
boy
you
are
she
said
no
worse
than
another
she
went
on
shaking
occasionally
with
laughter
still
holding
his
hands
frenchwomen
are
not
serious
she
asked
she
pronounced
it
you
are
making
fun
of
me
he
said
she
looked
at
him
kindly
shook
his
hands
vigorously
and
said
friends
friends
said
he
shaking
her
hand
you
will
think
of
corinette
when
she
is
gone
you
wo
be
angry
with
the
frenchwoman
for
not
being
serious
and
corinette
wo
be
angry
with
the
barbarous
teuton
for
being
so
stupid
that
is
why
she
loves
him
you
will
come
and
see
her
in
paris
it
is
a
promise
and
she
she
will
write
to
him
i
swear
it
you
say
swear
i
swear
no
not
like
that
you
must
hold
up
your
hand
she
recited
the
oath
of
the
horatii
she
made
him
promise
to
write
a
play
for
her
a
melodrama
which
could
be
translated
into
french
and
played
in
paris
by
her
she
was
going
away
next
day
with
her
company
he
promised
to
go
and
see
her
again
the
day
after
at
frankfort
where
they
were
giving
a
performance
they
stayed
talking
for
some
time
she
presented
christophe
with
a
photograph
in
which
she
was
much
décolletée
draped
only
in
a
garment
fastening
below
her
shoulders
they
parted
gaily
and
kissed
like
brother
and
sister
and
indeed
once
corinne
had
seen
that
christophe
was
fond
of
her
but
not
at
all
in
love
she
began
to
be
fond
of
him
too
without
love
as
a
good
friend
their
sleep
was
not
troubled
by
it
he
could
not
see
her
off
next
day
because
he
was
occupied
by
a
rehearsal
but
on
the
day
following
he
managed
to
go
to
frankfort
as
he
had
promised
it
was
a
few
hours
journey
by
rail
corinne
hardly
believed
christophe
promise
but
he
had
taken
it
seriously
and
when
the
performance
began
he
was
there
when
he
knocked
at
her
door
during
the
interval
she
gave
a
cry
of
glad
surprise
and
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
with
her
usual
exuberance
she
was
sincerely
grateful
to
him
for
having
come
unfortunately
for
christophe
she
was
much
more
sought
after
in
the
city
of
rich
intelligent
jews
who
could
appreciate
her
actual
beauty
and
her
future
success
almost
every
minute
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
it
opened
to
reveal
men
with
heavy
faces
and
quick
eyes
who
said
the
conventional
things
with
a
thick
accent
corinne
naturally
made
eyes
and
then
she
would
go
on
talking
to
christophe
in
the
same
affected
provoking
voice
and
that
irritated
him
and
he
found
no
pleasure
in
the
calm
lack
of
modesty
with
which
she
went
on
dressing
in
his
presence
and
the
paint
and
grease
with
which
she
larded
her
arms
throat
and
face
filled
him
with
profound
disgust
he
was
on
the
point
of
going
away
without
seeing
her
again
after
the
performance
but
when
he
said
and
begged
to
be
excused
from
going
to
the
supper
that
was
to
be
given
to
her
after
the
play
she
was
so
hurt
by
it
and
so
affectionate
too
that
he
could
not
hold
out
against
her
she
had
a
brought
so
as
to
prove
that
he
could
and
must
stay
an
hour
with
her
he
only
needed
to
be
convinced
and
he
was
at
the
supper
he
was
even
able
to
control
his
annoyance
with
the
follies
that
were
indulged
in
and
his
irritation
at
corinne
coquetries
with
all
and
sundry
it
was
impossible
to
be
angry
with
her
she
was
an
honest
girl
without
any
moral
principles
lazy
sensual
childishly
coquettish
but
at
the
same
time
so
loyal
so
kind
and
all
her
faults
were
so
spontaneous
and
so
healthy
that
it
was
only
possible
to
smile
at
them
and
even
to
love
them
christophe
who
was
sitting
opposite
her
watched
her
animation
her
radiant
eyes
her
sticky
lips
with
their
italian
smile
that
smile
in
which
there
is
kindness
subtlety
and
a
sort
of
heavy
greediness
he
saw
her
more
clearly
than
he
had
yet
done
some
of
her
features
reminded
him
of
ada
certain
gestures
certain
looks
certain
sensual
and
rather
coarse
tricks
the
eternal
feminine
but
what
he
loved
in
her
was
her
southern
nature
that
generous
nature
which
is
not
niggardly
with
its
gifts
which
never
troubles
to
fashion
beauties
and
literary
cleverness
but
harmonious
creatures
who
are
made
body
and
mind
to
grow
in
the
air
and
the
sun
when
he
left
she
got
up
from
the
table
to
say
to
him
away
from
the
others
they
kissed
and
renewed
their
promises
to
write
and
meet
again
he
took
the
last
train
home
at
a
station
the
train
coming
from
the
opposite
direction
was
waiting
in
the
carriage
opposite
his
a
compartment
christophe
saw
the
young
frenchwoman
who
had
been
with
him
to
the
performance
of
she
saw
christophe
and
recognized
him
they
were
both
astonished
they
bowed
and
did
not
move
and
dared
not
look
again
and
yet
he
had
seen
at
once
that
she
was
wearing
a
little
traveling
toque
and
had
an
old
valise
by
her
side
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
she
was
leaving
the
country
he
thought
she
must
be
going
away
for
a
few
days
he
did
not
know
whether
he
ought
to
speak
to
her
he
stopped
turned
over
in
his
mind
what
to
say
and
was
just
about
to
lower
the
window
of
the
carriage
to
address
a
few
words
to
her
when
the
signal
was
given
he
gave
up
the
idea
a
few
seconds
passed
before
the
train
moved
they
looked
straight
at
each
other
each
was
alone
and
their
faces
were
pressed
against
the
windows
and
they
looked
into
each
other
eyes
through
the
night
they
were
separated
by
two
windows
if
they
had
reached
out
their
hands
they
could
have
touched
each
other
so
near
so
far
the
carriages
shook
heavily
she
was
still
looking
at
him
shy
no
longer
now
that
they
were
parting
they
were
so
absorbed
in
looking
at
each
other
that
they
never
even
thought
of
bowing
for
the
last
time
she
was
slowly
borne
away
he
saw
her
disappear
and
the
train
which
bore
her
plunged
into
the
night
like
two
circling
worlds
they
had
passed
close
to
each
other
in
infinite
space
and
now
they
sped
apart
perhaps
for
eternity
when
she
had
disappeared
he
felt
the
emptiness
that
her
strange
eyes
had
left
in
him
and
he
did
not
understand
why
but
the
emptiness
was
there
sleepy
with
eyes
lying
in
a
corner
of
the
carriage
he
felt
her
eyes
looking
into
his
and
all
other
thoughts
ceased
to
let
him
feel
them
more
keenly
the
image
of
corinne
fluttered
outside
his
heart
like
an
insect
breaking
its
wings
against
a
window
but
he
did
not
let
it
in
he
found
it
again
when
he
got
out
of
the
train
on
his
arrival
when
the
keen
night
air
and
his
walk
through
the
streets
of
the
sleeping
town
had
shaken
off
his
drowsiness
he
scowled
at
the
thought
of
the
pretty
actress
with
a
mixture
of
pleasure
and
irritation
according
as
he
recalled
her
affectionate
ways
or
her
vulgar
coquetries
oh
these
french
people
he
growled
laughing
softly
while
he
was
undressing
quietly
so
as
not
to
waken
his
mother
who
was
asleep
in
the
next
room
a
remark
that
he
had
heard
the
other
evening
in
the
box
occurred
to
him
there
are
others
also
at
his
first
encounter
with
france
she
laid
before
him
the
enigma
of
her
double
nature
but
like
all
germans
he
did
not
trouble
to
solve
it
and
as
he
thought
of
the
girl
in
the
train
he
said
quietly
she
does
not
look
like
a
frenchwoman
as
if
a
german
could
say
what
is
french
and
what
is
not
french
or
not
she
filled
his
thoughts
for
he
woke
in
the
middle
of
the
night
with
a
pang
he
had
just
remembered
the
valise
on
the
seat
by
the
girl
side
and
suddenly
the
idea
that
she
had
gone
forever
crossed
his
mind
the
idea
must
have
come
to
him
at
the
time
but
he
had
not
thought
of
it
it
filled
him
with
a
strange
sadness
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
what
does
it
matter
to
me
he
said
it
is
not
my
affair
he
went
to
sleep
but
next
day
the
first
person
he
met
when
he
went
out
was
mannheim
who
called
him
blücher
and
asked
him
if
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
conquer
all
france
from
the
garrulous
newsmonger
he
learned
that
the
story
of
the
box
had
had
a
success
exceeding
all
mannheim
expectations
thanks
to
you
thanks
to
you
cried
mannheim
you
are
a
great
man
i
am
nothing
compared
with
you
what
have
i
done
said
christophe
you
are
wonderful
mannheim
replied
i
am
jealous
of
you
to
shut
the
box
in
the
grünebaums
faces
and
then
to
ask
the
french
governess
instead
of
them
no
that
takes
the
cake
i
should
never
have
thought
of
that
she
was
the
grünebaums
governess
said
christophe
in
amazement
yes
pretend
you
do
know
pretend
to
be
innocent
you
better
my
father
is
beside
himself
the
grünebaums
are
in
a
rage
it
was
not
for
long
they
have
sacked
the
girl
what
cried
christophe
they
have
dismissed
her
dismissed
her
because
of
me
did
you
know
said
mannheim
did
she
tell
you
christophe
was
in
despair
you
must
be
angry
old
man
said
mannheim
it
does
not
matter
besides
one
had
only
to
expect
that
the
grünebaums
would
find
out
what
cried
christophe
find
out
what
that
she
was
your
mistress
of
course
but
i
do
not
even
know
her
i
do
know
who
she
is
mannheim
smiled
as
if
to
say
you
take
me
for
a
fool
christophe
lost
his
temper
and
bade
mannheim
do
him
the
honor
of
believing
what
he
said
mannheim
said
then
it
is
even
more
humorous
christophe
worried
about
it
and
talked
of
going
to
the
grünebaums
and
telling
them
the
facts
and
justifying
the
girl
mannheim
dissuaded
him
my
dear
fellow
he
said
anything
you
may
say
will
only
convince
them
of
the
contrary
besides
it
is
too
late
the
girl
has
gone
away
christophe
was
utterly
sick
at
heart
and
tried
to
trace
the
young
frenchwoman
he
wanted
to
write
to
her
to
beg
her
pardon
but
nothing
was
known
of
her
he
applied
to
the
grünebaums
but
they
snubbed
him
they
did
not
know
themselves
where
she
had
gone
and
they
did
not
care
the
idea
of
the
harm
he
had
done
in
trying
to
do
good
tortured
christophe
he
was
remorseful
but
added
to
his
remorse
was
a
mysterious
attraction
which
shone
upon
him
from
the
eyes
of
the
woman
who
was
gone
attraction
and
remorse
both
seemed
to
be
blotted
out
engulfed
in
the
flood
of
the
new
thoughts
but
they
endured
in
the
depths
of
his
heart
christophe
did
not
forget
the
woman
whom
he
called
his
victim
he
had
sworn
to
meet
her
again
he
knew
how
small
were
the
chances
of
his
ever
seeing
her
again
and
he
was
sure
that
he
would
see
her
again
as
for
corinne
she
never
answered
his
letters
but
three
months
later
when
he
had
given
up
expecting
to
hear
from
her
he
received
a
telegram
of
forty
words
of
utter
nonsense
in
which
she
addressed
him
in
little
familiar
terms
and
asked
if
they
were
still
fond
of
each
other
then
after
nearly
a
year
silence
there
came
a
scrappy
letter
scrawled
in
her
enormous
childish
zigzag
writing
in
which
she
tried
to
play
the
lady
a
few
affectionate
droll
words
and
there
she
left
it
she
did
not
forget
him
but
she
had
no
time
to
think
of
him
still
under
the
spell
of
corinne
and
full
of
the
ideas
they
had
exchanged
about
art
christophe
dreamed
of
writing
the
music
for
a
play
in
which
corinne
should
act
and
sing
a
few
airs
a
sort
of
poetic
melodrama
that
form
of
art
once
so
much
in
favor
in
germany
passionately
admired
by
mozart
and
practised
by
beethoven
weber
mendelssohn
and
schumann
and
all
the
great
classics
had
fallen
into
discredit
since
the
triumph
of
wagnerism
which
claimed
to
have
realized
the
definite
formula
of
the
theater
and
music
the
wagnerian
pedants
not
content
with
proscribing
every
new
melodrama
busied
themselves
with
dressing
up
the
old
melodramas
and
operas
they
carefully
effaced
every
trace
of
spoken
dialogue
and
wrote
for
mozart
beethoven
or
weber
recitations
in
their
own
manner
they
were
convinced
that
they
were
doing
a
service
to
the
fame
of
the
masters
and
filling
out
their
thoughts
by
the
pious
deposit
of
their
dung
upon
masterpieces
christophe
who
had
been
made
more
sensible
of
the
heaviness
and
often
the
ugliness
of
wagnerian
declamation
by
corinne
had
for
some
time
been
debating
whether
it
was
not
nonsense
and
an
offense
against
nature
to
harness
and
yoke
together
the
spoken
word
and
the
word
sung
in
the
theater
it
was
like
harnessing
a
horse
and
a
bird
to
a
cart
speech
and
singing
each
had
its
rhythm
it
was
comprehensible
that
an
artist
should
sacrifice
one
of
the
two
arts
to
the
triumph
of
that
which
he
preferred
but
to
try
to
find
a
compromise
between
them
was
to
sacrifice
both
it
was
to
want
speech
no
longer
to
be
speech
and
singing
no
longer
to
be
singing
to
want
singing
to
let
its
vast
flood
be
confined
between
the
banks
of
monotonous
canals
to
want
speech
to
cloak
its
lovely
naked
limbs
with
rich
heavy
stuffs
which
must
paralyze
its
gestures
and
movements
why
not
leave
both
with
their
spontaneity
and
freedom
of
movement
like
a
beautiful
girl
walking
tranquilly
lithely
along
a
stream
dreaming
as
she
goes
the
gay
murmur
of
the
water
lulls
her
dreams
and
unconsciously
she
brings
her
steps
and
her
thoughts
in
tune
with
the
song
of
the
stream
so
being
both
free
music
and
poesy
would
go
side
by
side
dreaming
their
dreams
mingling
assuredly
all
music
was
not
good
for
such
a
union
nor
all
poetry
the
opponents
of
melodrama
had
good
ground
for
attack
in
the
coarseness
of
the
attempts
which
had
been
made
in
that
form
and
of
the
interpreters
christophe
had
for
long
shared
their
dislike
the
stupidity
of
the
actors
who
delivered
these
recitations
spoken
to
an
instrumental
accompaniment
without
bothering
about
the
accompaniment
without
trying
to
merge
their
voices
in
it
rather
on
the
contrary
trying
to
prevent
anything
being
heard
but
themselves
was
calculated
to
revolt
any
musical
ear
but
since
he
had
tasted
the
beauty
of
corinne
harmonious
voice
that
liquid
and
pure
voice
which
played
upon
music
like
a
ray
of
light
on
water
which
wedded
every
turn
of
a
melody
which
was
like
the
most
fluid
and
most
free
singing
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
beauty
of
a
new
art
perhaps
he
was
right
but
he
was
still
too
inexperienced
to
venture
without
peril
upon
a
form
which
if
it
is
meant
to
be
beautiful
and
really
artistic
is
the
most
difficult
of
all
that
art
especially
demands
one
essential
condition
the
perfect
harmony
of
the
combined
efforts
of
the
poet
the
musicians
and
the
actors
christophe
had
no
tremors
about
it
he
hurled
himself
blindly
at
an
unknown
art
of
which
the
laws
were
only
known
to
himself
his
first
idea
had
been
to
clothe
in
music
a
fairy
fantasy
of
shakespeare
or
an
act
of
the
second
part
of
but
the
theaters
showed
little
disposition
to
make
the
experiment
it
would
be
too
costly
and
appeared
absurd
they
were
quite
willing
to
admit
christophe
efficiency
in
music
but
that
he
should
take
upon
himself
to
have
ideas
about
poetry
and
the
theater
made
them
smile
they
did
not
take
him
seriously
the
world
of
music
and
the
world
of
poesy
were
like
two
foreign
and
secretly
hostile
states
christophe
had
to
accept
the
collaboration
of
a
poet
to
be
able
to
set
foot
upon
poetic
territory
and
he
was
not
allowed
to
choose
his
own
poet
he
would
not
have
dared
to
choose
himself
he
did
not
trust
his
taste
in
poetry
he
had
been
told
that
he
knew
nothing
about
it
and
indeed
he
could
not
understand
the
poetry
which
was
admired
by
those
about
him
with
his
usual
honesty
and
stubbornness
he
had
tried
hard
sometimes
to
feel
the
beauty
of
some
of
these
works
but
he
had
always
been
bewildered
and
a
little
ashamed
of
himself
no
decidedly
he
was
not
a
poet
in
truth
he
loved
passionately
certain
old
poets
and
that
consoled
him
a
little
but
no
doubt
he
did
not
love
them
as
they
should
be
loved
had
he
not
once
expressed
the
ridiculous
idea
that
those
poets
only
are
great
who
remain
great
even
when
they
are
translated
into
prose
and
even
into
the
prose
of
a
foreign
language
and
that
words
have
no
value
apart
from
the
soul
which
they
express
his
friends
had
laughed
at
him
mannheim
had
called
him
a
goose
he
did
not
try
to
defend
himself
as
every
day
he
saw
through
the
example
of
writers
who
talk
of
music
the
absurdity
of
artists
who
attempt
to
image
any
art
other
than
their
own
he
resigned
himself
though
a
little
incredulous
at
heart
to
his
incompetence
in
poetry
and
he
shut
his
eyes
and
accepted
the
judgments
of
those
whom
he
thought
were
better
informed
than
himself
so
he
let
his
friends
of
the
review
impose
one
of
their
number
on
him
a
great
man
of
a
decadent
coterie
stephen
von
hellmuth
who
brought
him
an
it
was
at
the
time
when
german
poets
like
their
colleagues
in
france
were
recasting
all
the
greek
tragedies
stephen
von
hellmuth
work
was
one
of
those
astounding
plays
in
which
ibsen
homer
and
oscar
wilde
are
compounded
and
of
course
a
few
manuals
of
archeology
agamemnon
was
neurasthenic
and
achilles
impotent
they
lamented
their
condition
at
length
and
naturally
their
outcries
produced
no
change
the
energy
of
the
drama
was
concentrated
in
the
rôle
of
iphigenia
a
nervous
hysterical
and
pedantic
iphigenia
who
lectured
the
hero
declaimed
furiously
laid
bare
for
the
audience
her
nietzschian
pessimism
and
glutted
with
death
cut
her
throat
shrieking
with
laughter
nothing
could
be
more
contrary
to
christophe
mind
than
such
pretentious
degenerate
ostrogothic
stuff
in
greek
dress
it
was
hailed
as
a
masterpiece
by
everybody
about
him
he
was
cowardly
and
was
overpersuaded
in
truth
he
was
bursting
with
music
and
thinking
much
more
of
his
music
than
of
the
text
the
text
was
a
new
bed
into
which
to
let
loose
the
flood
of
his
passions
he
was
as
far
as
possible
from
the
state
of
abnegation
and
intelligent
impersonality
proper
to
musical
translation
of
a
poetic
work
he
was
thinking
only
of
himself
and
not
at
all
of
the
work
he
never
thought
of
adapting
himself
to
it
he
was
under
an
illusion
he
saw
in
the
poem
something
absolutely
different
from
what
was
actually
in
it
just
as
when
he
was
a
child
he
used
to
compose
in
his
mind
a
play
entirely
different
from
that
which
was
upon
the
stage
it
was
not
until
it
came
to
rehearsal
that
he
saw
the
real
play
one
day
he
was
listening
to
a
scene
and
he
thought
it
so
stupid
that
he
fancied
the
actors
must
be
spoiling
it
and
went
so
far
as
to
explain
it
to
them
in
the
poet
presence
but
also
to
explain
it
to
the
poet
himself
who
was
defending
his
interpretation
the
author
refused
bluntly
to
hear
him
and
said
with
some
asperity
that
he
thought
he
knew
what
he
had
meant
to
write
christophe
would
not
give
in
and
maintained
that
hellmuth
knew
nothing
about
it
the
general
merriment
told
him
that
he
was
making
himself
ridiculous
he
said
no
more
agreeing
that
after
all
it
was
not
he
who
had
written
the
poem
then
he
saw
the
appalling
emptiness
of
the
play
and
was
overwhelmed
by
it
he
wondered
how
he
could
ever
have
been
persuaded
to
try
it
he
called
himself
an
idiot
and
tore
his
hair
he
tried
in
vain
to
reassure
himself
by
saying
you
know
nothing
about
it
it
is
not
your
business
keep
to
your
music
he
was
so
much
ashamed
of
certain
idiotic
things
in
it
of
the
pretentious
pathos
the
crying
falsity
of
the
words
the
gestures
and
attitudes
that
sometimes
when
he
was
conducting
the
orchestra
he
hardly
had
the
strength
to
raise
his
baton
he
wanted
to
go
and
hide
in
the
prompter
box
he
was
too
frank
and
too
little
politic
to
conceal
what
he
thought
every
one
noticed
it
his
friends
the
actors
and
the
author
hellmuth
said
to
him
with
a
frigid
smile
is
it
not
fortunate
enough
to
please
you
christophe
replied
honestly
truth
to
tell
no
i
do
understand
it
then
you
did
not
read
it
when
you
set
it
to
music
yes
said
christophe
naïvely
but
i
made
a
mistake
i
understood
it
differently
it
is
a
pity
you
did
not
write
what
you
understood
yourself
oh
if
only
i
could
have
done
so
said
christophe
the
poet
was
vexed
and
in
his
turn
criticised
the
music
he
complained
that
it
was
in
the
way
and
prevented
his
words
being
heard
if
the
poet
did
not
understand
the
musician
or
the
musician
the
poet
the
actors
understood
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
and
did
not
care
they
were
only
asking
for
sentences
in
their
parts
on
which
to
bring
in
their
usual
effects
they
had
no
idea
of
adapting
their
declamation
to
the
formality
of
the
piece
and
the
musical
rhythm
they
went
one
way
the
music
another
it
was
as
though
they
were
constantly
singing
out
of
tune
christophe
ground
his
teeth
and
shouted
the
note
at
them
until
he
was
hoarse
they
let
him
shout
and
went
on
imperturbably
not
even
understanding
what
he
wanted
them
to
do
christophe
would
have
flung
the
whole
thing
up
if
the
rehearsals
had
not
been
so
far
advanced
and
he
had
not
been
bound
to
go
on
by
fear
of
legal
proceedings
mannheim
to
whom
he
confided
his
discouragement
laughed
at
him
what
is
it
he
asked
it
is
all
going
well
you
do
understand
each
other
what
does
that
matter
who
has
ever
understood
his
work
but
the
author
it
is
a
whether
he
understands
it
himself
christophe
was
worried
about
the
stupidity
of
the
poem
which
he
said
would
ruin
the
music
mannheim
made
no
difficulty
about
admitting
that
there
was
no
common
sense
in
the
poem
and
that
hellmuth
was
a
muff
but
he
would
not
worry
about
him
hellmuth
gave
good
dinners
and
had
a
pretty
wife
what
more
did
criticism
want
christophe
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
that
he
had
no
time
to
listen
to
nonsense
it
is
not
nonsense
said
mannheim
laughing
how
serious
people
are
they
have
no
idea
of
what
matters
in
life
and
he
advised
christophe
not
to
bother
so
much
about
hellmuth
business
but
to
attend
to
his
own
he
wanted
him
to
advertise
a
little
christophe
refused
indignantly
to
a
reporter
who
came
and
asked
for
a
history
of
his
life
he
replied
furiously
it
is
not
your
affair
and
when
they
asked
for
his
photograph
for
a
review
he
stamped
with
rage
and
shouted
that
he
was
not
thank
god
an
emperor
to
have
his
face
passed
from
hand
to
hand
it
was
impossible
to
bring
him
into
touch
with
influential
people
he
never
replied
to
invitations
and
when
he
had
been
forced
by
any
chance
to
accept
he
would
forget
to
go
or
would
go
with
such
a
bad
grace
that
he
seemed
to
have
set
himself
to
be
disagreeable
to
everybody
but
the
climax
came
when
he
quarreled
with
his
review
two
days
before
the
performance
the
thing
was
bound
to
happen
mannheim
had
gone
on
revising
articles
and
he
no
longer
scrupled
about
deleting
whole
lines
of
criticism
and
replacing
them
with
compliments
one
day
out
visiting
christophe
met
a
certain
virtuoso
a
foppish
pianist
whom
he
had
slaughtered
the
man
came
and
thanked
him
with
a
smile
that
showed
all
his
white
teeth
he
replied
brutally
that
there
was
no
reason
for
it
the
other
insisted
and
poured
forth
expressions
of
gratitude
christophe
cut
him
short
by
saying
that
if
he
was
satisfied
with
the
article
that
was
his
affair
but
that
the
article
had
certainly
not
been
written
with
a
view
to
pleasing
him
and
he
turned
his
back
on
him
the
virtuoso
thought
him
a
kindly
boor
and
went
away
laughing
but
christophe
remembered
having
received
a
card
of
thanks
from
another
of
his
victims
and
a
suspicion
flashed
upon
him
he
went
out
bought
the
last
number
of
the
review
at
a
turned
to
his
article
and
read
at
first
he
wondered
if
he
were
going
mad
then
he
understood
and
mad
with
rage
he
ran
to
the
office
of
the
waldhaus
and
mannheim
were
there
talking
to
an
actress
whom
they
knew
they
had
no
need
to
ask
christophe
what
brought
him
throwing
a
number
of
the
review
on
the
table
christophe
let
fly
at
them
without
stopping
to
take
breath
with
extraordinary
violence
shouting
calling
them
rogues
rascals
forgers
thumping
on
the
floor
with
a
chair
mannheim
began
to
laugh
christophe
tried
to
kick
him
mannheim
took
refuge
behind
the
table
and
rolled
with
laughter
but
waldhaus
took
it
very
loftily
with
dignity
formally
he
tried
to
make
himself
heard
through
the
row
and
said
that
he
would
not
allow
any
one
to
talk
to
him
in
such
a
tone
that
christophe
should
hear
from
him
and
he
held
out
his
card
christophe
flung
it
in
his
face
i
do
need
your
card
to
know
what
you
are
you
are
a
rascal
and
a
forger
and
you
think
i
would
fight
with
you
a
thrashing
is
all
you
deserve
his
voice
could
be
heard
in
the
street
people
stopped
to
listen
mannheim
closed
the
windows
the
actress
tried
to
escape
but
christophe
was
blocking
the
way
waldhaus
was
pale
and
choking
mannheim
was
stuttering
and
stammering
and
trying
to
reply
christophe
did
not
let
them
speak
he
let
loose
upon
them
every
expression
he
could
think
of
and
never
stopped
until
he
was
out
of
breath
and
had
come
to
an
end
of
his
insults
waldhaus
and
mannheim
only
found
their
tongues
after
he
had
gone
mannheim
quickly
recovered
himself
insults
slipped
from
him
like
water
from
a
duck
back
but
waldhaus
was
still
sore
his
dignity
had
been
outraged
and
what
made
the
affront
more
mortifying
was
that
there
had
been
witnesses
he
would
never
forgive
it
his
colleagues
joined
chorus
with
him
mannheim
only
of
the
staff
of
the
review
was
not
angry
with
christophe
he
had
had
his
fill
of
entertainment
out
of
him
it
did
not
seem
to
him
a
heavy
price
to
pay
for
his
pound
of
flesh
to
suffer
a
few
violent
words
it
had
been
a
good
joke
if
he
had
been
the
butt
of
it
he
would
have
been
the
first
to
laugh
and
so
he
was
quite
ready
to
shake
hands
with
christophe
as
though
nothing
had
happened
but
christophe
was
more
rancorous
and
rejected
all
advances
mannheim
did
not
care
christophe
was
a
toy
from
which
he
had
extracted
all
the
amusement
possible
he
was
beginning
to
want
a
new
puppet
from
that
very
day
all
was
over
between
them
but
that
did
not
prevent
mannheim
still
saying
whenever
christophe
was
mentioned
in
his
presence
that
they
were
intimate
friends
and
perhaps
he
thought
they
were
two
days
after
the
quarrel
the
first
performance
of
took
place
it
was
an
utter
failure
waldhaus
review
praised
the
poem
and
made
no
mention
of
the
music
the
other
papers
and
reviews
made
merry
over
it
they
laughed
and
hissed
the
piece
was
withdrawn
after
the
third
performance
but
the
jokes
at
its
expense
did
not
disappear
so
quickly
people
were
only
too
glad
of
the
opportunity
of
having
a
fling
at
christophe
and
for
several
weeks
the
remained
an
unfailing
subject
for
joking
they
knew
that
christophe
had
no
weapon
of
defense
and
they
took
advantage
of
it
the
only
thing
which
held
them
back
a
little
was
his
position
at
the
court
although
his
relation
with
the
grand
duke
had
become
quite
cold
for
the
prince
had
several
times
made
remarks
to
which
he
had
paid
no
attention
whatever
he
still
went
to
the
palace
at
intervals
and
still
enjoyed
in
the
eye
of
the
public
a
sort
of
official
protection
though
it
was
more
visionary
than
real
he
took
upon
himself
to
destroy
even
that
last
support
he
suffered
from
the
criticisms
they
were
concerned
not
only
with
his
music
but
also
with
his
idea
of
a
new
form
of
art
which
the
writers
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
understand
it
was
very
easy
to
travesty
it
and
make
fun
of
it
christophe
was
not
yet
wise
enough
to
know
that
the
best
reply
to
dishonest
critics
is
to
make
none
and
to
go
on
working
for
some
months
past
he
had
fallen
into
the
bad
habit
of
not
letting
any
unjust
attack
go
unanswered
he
wrote
an
article
in
which
he
did
not
spare
certain
of
his
adversaries
the
two
papers
to
which
he
took
it
returned
it
with
ironically
polite
excuses
for
being
unable
to
publish
it
christophe
stuck
to
his
guns
he
remembered
that
the
socialist
paper
in
the
town
had
made
advances
to
him
he
knew
one
of
the
editors
they
used
to
meet
and
talk
occasionally
christophe
was
glad
to
find
some
one
who
would
talk
freely
about
power
the
army
and
oppression
and
archaic
prejudices
but
they
could
not
go
far
with
each
other
for
the
socialist
always
came
back
to
karl
marx
about
whom
christophe
cared
not
a
rap
moreover
christophe
used
to
find
in
his
speeches
about
the
free
man
besides
a
materialism
which
was
not
much
to
his
taste
a
pedantic
severity
and
a
despotism
of
thought
a
secret
cult
of
force
an
inverse
militarism
all
of
which
did
not
sound
very
different
from
what
he
heard
every
day
in
german
however
he
thought
of
this
man
and
his
paper
when
he
saw
all
other
doors
in
journalism
closed
to
him
he
knew
that
his
doing
so
would
cause
a
scandal
the
paper
was
violent
malignant
and
always
being
condemned
but
as
christophe
never
read
it
he
only
thought
of
the
boldness
of
its
ideas
of
which
he
was
not
afraid
and
not
of
the
baseness
of
its
tone
which
would
have
repelled
him
besides
he
was
so
angry
at
seeing
the
other
papers
in
alliance
to
suppress
him
that
perhaps
he
would
have
gone
on
even
if
he
had
been
warned
he
wanted
to
show
people
that
he
was
not
so
easily
got
rid
of
so
he
took
his
article
to
the
socialist
paper
which
received
it
with
open
arms
the
next
day
the
article
appeared
and
the
paper
announced
in
large
letters
that
it
had
engaged
the
support
of
the
young
and
talented
maestro
krafft
whose
keen
sympathy
with
the
demands
of
the
working
classes
was
well
known
christophe
read
neither
the
note
nor
the
article
for
he
had
gone
out
before
dawn
for
a
walk
in
the
country
it
being
sunday
he
was
in
fine
fettle
as
he
saw
the
sun
rise
he
shouted
laughed
yodeled
leaped
and
danced
no
more
review
no
more
criticisms
to
do
it
was
spring
and
there
was
once
more
the
music
of
the
heavens
and
the
earth
the
most
beautiful
of
all
no
more
dark
concert
rooms
stuffy
and
smelly
unpleasant
people
dull
performers
now
the
marvelous
song
of
the
murmuring
forests
was
to
be
heard
and
over
the
fields
like
waves
there
passed
the
intoxicating
scents
of
life
breaking
through
the
crust
of
the
earth
and
issuing
from
the
grave
he
went
home
with
his
head
buzzing
with
light
and
music
and
his
mother
gave
him
a
letter
which
had
been
brought
from
the
palace
while
he
was
away
the
letter
was
in
an
impersonal
form
and
told
herr
krafft
that
he
was
to
go
to
the
palace
that
morning
the
morning
was
past
it
was
nearly
one
christophe
was
not
put
about
it
is
too
late
now
he
said
it
will
do
but
his
mother
said
anxiously
no
no
you
can
not
put
off
an
appointment
with
his
highness
like
that
you
must
go
at
once
perhaps
it
is
a
matter
of
importance
christophe
shrugged
his
shoulders
important
as
if
those
people
could
have
anything
important
to
say
he
wants
to
tell
me
his
ideas
about
music
that
will
be
funny
if
only
he
has
not
taken
it
into
his
head
to
rival
siegfried
meyer
footnote
a
nickname
given
by
german
pamphleteers
to
his
majesty
the
emperor
and
wants
to
show
me
a
to
i
vow
that
i
will
not
spare
him
i
shall
say
to
politics
you
are
master
there
you
will
always
be
right
but
beware
of
art
in
art
you
are
seen
without
your
plumes
your
helmet
your
uniform
your
money
your
titles
your
ancestors
your
policemen
and
just
think
for
a
moment
what
will
be
left
of
you
then
poor
louisa
took
him
quite
seriously
and
raised
her
hands
in
horror
you
wo
say
that
you
are
mad
mad
it
amused
him
to
make
her
uneasy
by
playing
upon
her
credulity
until
he
became
so
extravagant
that
louisa
began
to
see
that
he
was
making
fun
of
her
you
are
stupid
my
boy
he
laughed
and
kissed
her
he
was
in
a
wonderfully
good
humor
on
his
walk
he
had
found
a
beautiful
musical
theme
and
he
felt
it
frolicking
in
him
like
a
fish
in
water
he
refused
to
go
to
the
palace
until
he
had
had
something
to
eat
he
was
as
hungry
as
an
ape
louisa
then
supervised
his
dressing
for
he
was
beginning
to
tease
her
again
pretending
that
he
was
quite
all
right
as
he
was
with
his
old
clothes
and
dusty
boots
but
he
changed
them
all
the
same
and
cleaned
his
boots
whistling
like
a
blackbird
and
imitating
all
the
instruments
in
an
orchestra
when
he
had
finished
his
mother
inspected
him
and
gravely
tied
his
tie
for
him
again
for
once
in
a
way
he
was
very
patient
because
he
was
pleased
with
himself
which
was
not
very
usual
he
went
off
saying
that
he
was
going
to
elope
with
princess
adelaide
the
grand
duke
daughter
quite
a
pretty
woman
who
was
married
to
a
german
princeling
and
had
come
to
stay
with
her
parents
for
a
few
weeks
she
had
shown
sympathy
for
christophe
when
he
was
a
child
and
he
had
a
soft
side
for
her
louisa
used
to
declare
that
he
was
in
love
with
her
and
he
would
pretend
to
be
so
in
fun
he
did
not
hurry
he
dawdled
and
looked
into
the
shops
and
stopped
to
pat
some
dog
that
he
knew
as
it
lay
on
its
side
and
yawned
in
the
sun
he
jumped
over
the
harmless
railings
which
inclosed
the
palace
square
a
great
empty
square
surrounded
with
houses
with
two
little
fountains
two
symmetrical
bare
divided
as
by
a
parting
by
a
gravel
path
carefully
raked
and
bordered
by
orange
trees
in
tubs
in
the
middle
was
the
bronze
statue
of
some
unknown
grand
duke
in
the
costume
of
louis
philippe
on
a
pediment
adorned
at
the
four
corners
by
allegorical
figures
representing
the
virtues
on
a
seat
one
solitary
man
was
dozing
over
his
paper
behind
the
silly
moat
of
the
earthworks
of
the
palace
two
sleepy
cannon
yawned
upon
the
sleepy
town
christophe
laughed
at
the
whole
thing
he
entered
the
palace
without
troubling
to
take
on
a
more
official
manner
at
most
he
stopped
humming
but
his
thoughts
went
dancing
on
inside
him
he
threw
his
hat
on
the
table
in
the
hall
and
familiarly
greeted
the
old
usher
whom
he
had
known
since
he
was
a
child
the
old
man
had
been
there
on
the
day
when
christophe
had
first
entered
the
palace
on
the
evening
when
he
had
seen
hassler
but
the
old
man
who
always
used
to
reply
to
christophe
disrespectful
sallies
now
seemed
a
little
haughty
christophe
paid
no
heed
to
it
a
little
farther
on
in
the
he
met
a
clerk
of
the
chancery
who
was
usually
full
of
conversation
and
very
friendly
he
was
surprised
to
see
him
hurry
past
him
to
avoid
having
to
talk
however
he
did
not
attach
any
significance
to
it
and
went
on
and
asked
to
be
shown
in
he
went
in
they
had
just
finished
dinner
his
highness
was
in
one
of
the
he
was
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
smoking
and
talking
to
his
guests
among
whom
christophe
saw
princess
who
was
also
smoking
she
was
lying
back
in
an
armchair
and
talking
in
a
loud
voice
to
some
officers
who
made
a
circle
about
her
the
gathering
was
lively
they
were
all
very
merry
and
when
christophe
entered
he
heard
the
grand
thick
laugh
but
he
stopped
dead
when
he
saw
christophe
he
growled
and
pounced
on
him
ah
there
you
are
he
said
you
have
condescended
to
come
at
last
do
you
think
you
can
go
on
making
fun
of
me
any
longer
you
a
blackguard
sir
christophe
was
so
staggered
by
this
brutal
attack
that
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
utter
a
word
he
was
thinking
that
he
was
only
late
and
that
that
could
not
have
provoked
such
violence
he
murmured
what
have
i
done
your
highness
his
highness
did
not
listen
and
went
on
angrily
be
silent
i
will
not
be
insulted
by
a
blackguard
christophe
turned
pale
and
gulped
so
as
to
try
to
speak
for
he
was
choking
he
made
an
effort
and
said
your
highness
you
have
no
right
you
have
no
right
to
insult
me
without
telling
me
what
i
have
done
the
grand
duke
turned
to
his
secretary
who
produced
a
paper
from
his
pocket
and
held
it
out
to
him
he
was
in
such
a
state
of
exasperation
as
could
not
be
explained
only
by
his
anger
the
fumes
of
good
wine
had
their
share
in
it
too
he
came
and
stood
in
front
of
christophe
and
like
a
toreador
with
his
cape
furiously
waved
the
crumpled
newspaper
in
his
face
and
shouted
your
muck
sir
you
deserve
to
have
your
nose
rubbed
in
it
christophe
recognized
the
socialist
paper
i
do
see
what
harm
there
is
in
it
he
said
what
what
screamed
the
grand
duke
you
are
impudent
this
rascally
paper
which
insults
me
from
day
to
day
and
spews
out
filthy
insults
upon
me
sire
said
christophe
i
have
not
read
it
you
lie
shouted
the
grand
duke
you
shall
not
call
me
a
liar
said
christophe
i
have
not
read
it
i
am
only
concerned
with
reviews
and
besides
i
have
the
right
to
write
in
whatever
paper
i
like
you
have
no
right
but
to
hold
your
tongue
i
have
been
too
kind
to
you
i
have
heaped
kindness
upon
you
you
and
yours
in
spite
of
your
misconduct
and
your
father
which
would
have
justified
me
in
cutting
you
off
i
forbid
you
to
go
on
writing
in
a
paper
which
is
hostile
to
me
and
further
i
forbid
you
altogether
to
write
anything
in
future
without
my
authority
i
have
had
enough
of
your
musical
polemics
i
will
not
allow
any
one
who
enjoys
my
patronage
to
spend
his
time
in
attacking
everything
which
is
dear
to
people
of
taste
and
feeling
to
all
true
germans
you
would
do
better
to
write
better
music
or
if
that
is
impossible
to
practise
your
scales
and
exercises
i
do
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
a
musical
bebel
who
amuses
himself
by
decrying
all
our
national
glories
and
upsetting
the
minds
of
the
people
we
know
what
is
good
thank
god
we
do
not
need
to
wait
for
you
to
tell
us
go
to
your
piano
sir
or
leave
us
in
peace
standing
face
to
face
with
christophe
the
fat
man
glared
at
him
insultingly
christophe
was
livid
and
tried
to
speak
his
lips
moved
he
stammered
i
am
not
your
slave
i
shall
say
what
i
like
and
write
what
i
like
he
choked
he
was
almost
weeping
with
shame
and
rage
his
legs
were
trembling
he
jerked
his
elbow
and
upset
an
ornament
on
a
table
by
his
side
he
felt
that
he
was
in
a
ridiculous
position
he
heard
people
laughing
he
looked
down
the
room
and
as
through
a
mist
saw
the
princess
watching
the
scene
and
exchanging
ironically
commiserating
remarks
with
her
neighbors
he
lost
count
of
what
exactly
happened
the
grand
duke
shouted
christophe
shouted
louder
than
he
without
knowing
what
he
said
the
prince
secretary
and
another
official
came
towards
him
and
tried
to
stop
him
he
pushed
them
away
and
while
he
talked
he
waved
an
which
he
had
mechanically
picked
up
from
the
table
against
which
he
was
leaning
he
heard
the
secretary
say
put
it
down
put
it
down
and
he
heard
himself
shouting
inarticulately
and
knocking
on
the
edge
of
the
table
with
the
go
roared
the
grand
duke
beside
himself
with
rage
go
go
i
have
you
thrown
out
the
officers
had
come
up
to
the
prince
and
were
trying
to
calm
him
the
grand
duke
looked
apoplectic
his
eyes
were
starting
from
his
head
he
shouted
to
them
to
throw
the
rascal
out
christophe
saw
red
he
longed
to
thrust
his
fist
in
the
grand
duke
face
but
he
was
crushed
under
a
weight
of
conflicting
feelings
shame
fury
a
remnant
of
shyness
of
german
loyalty
traditional
respect
habits
of
humility
in
the
prince
presence
he
tried
to
speak
he
could
not
he
tried
to
move
he
could
not
he
could
not
see
or
hear
he
suffered
them
to
push
him
along
and
left
the
room
he
passed
through
the
impassive
servants
who
had
come
up
to
the
door
and
had
missed
nothing
of
the
quarrel
he
had
to
go
thirty
yards
to
cross
the
and
it
seemed
a
lifetime
the
corridor
grew
longer
and
longer
as
he
walked
up
it
he
would
never
get
out
the
light
of
day
which
he
saw
shining
downstairs
through
the
glass
door
was
his
haven
he
went
stumbling
down
the
stairs
he
forgot
that
he
was
bareheaded
the
old
usher
reminded
him
to
take
his
hat
he
had
to
gather
all
his
forces
to
leave
the
castle
cross
the
court
reach
his
home
his
teeth
were
chattering
when
he
opened
the
door
his
mother
was
terrified
by
his
face
and
his
trembling
he
avoided
her
and
refused
to
answer
her
questions
he
went
up
to
his
room
shut
himself
in
and
lay
down
he
was
shaking
so
that
he
could
not
undress
his
breathing
came
in
jerks
and
his
whole
body
seemed
shattered
oh
if
only
he
could
see
no
more
feel
no
more
no
longer
have
to
bear
with
his
wretched
body
no
longer
have
to
struggle
against
ignoble
life
and
fall
fall
breathless
without
thought
and
no
longer
be
anywhere
with
frightful
difficulty
he
tore
off
his
clothes
and
left
them
on
the
ground
and
then
flung
himself
into
his
bed
and
drew
the
coverings
over
him
there
was
no
sound
in
the
room
save
that
of
the
little
iron
bed
rattling
on
the
tiled
floor
louisa
listened
at
the
door
she
knocked
in
vain
she
called
softly
there
was
no
reply
she
waited
anxiously
listening
through
the
silence
then
she
went
away
once
or
twice
during
the
day
she
came
and
listened
and
again
at
night
before
she
went
to
bed
day
passed
and
the
night
the
house
was
still
christophe
was
shaking
with
fever
every
now
and
then
he
wept
and
in
the
night
he
got
up
several
times
and
shook
his
fist
at
the
wall
about
two
in
an
access
of
madness
he
got
up
from
his
bed
sweating
and
half
naked
he
wanted
to
go
and
kill
the
grand
duke
he
was
devoured
by
hate
and
shame
his
body
and
his
heart
writhed
in
the
fire
of
it
nothing
of
all
the
storm
in
him
could
be
heard
outside
not
a
word
not
a
sound
with
clenched
teeth
he
fought
it
down
and
forced
it
back
into
himself
next
morning
he
came
down
as
usual
he
was
a
wreck
he
said
nothing
and
his
mother
dared
not
question
him
she
knew
from
the
gossip
of
the
neighborhood
all
day
he
stayed
sitting
by
the
fire
silent
feverish
and
with
bent
head
like
a
little
old
man
and
when
he
was
alone
he
wept
in
silence
in
the
evening
the
editor
of
the
socialist
paper
came
to
see
him
naturally
he
had
heard
and
wished
to
have
details
christophe
was
touched
by
his
coming
and
interpreted
it
naïvely
as
a
mark
of
sympathy
and
a
desire
for
forgiveness
on
the
part
of
those
who
had
compromised
him
he
made
a
point
of
seeming
to
regret
nothing
and
he
let
himself
go
and
said
everything
that
was
rankling
in
him
it
was
some
solace
for
him
to
talk
freely
to
a
man
who
shared
his
hatred
of
oppression
the
other
urged
him
on
he
saw
a
good
chance
for
his
journal
in
the
event
and
an
opportunity
for
a
scandalous
article
for
which
he
expected
christophe
to
provide
him
with
material
if
he
did
not
write
it
himself
for
he
thought
that
after
such
an
explosion
the
court
musician
would
put
his
very
considerable
political
talents
and
his
no
less
considerable
little
of
secret
information
about
the
court
at
the
service
of
the
cause
as
he
did
not
plume
himself
on
his
subtlety
he
presented
the
thing
rawly
in
the
crudest
light
christophe
started
he
declared
that
he
would
write
nothing
and
said
that
any
attack
on
the
grand
duke
that
he
might
make
would
be
interpreted
as
an
act
of
personal
vengeance
and
that
he
would
be
more
reserved
now
that
he
was
free
than
when
not
being
free
he
ran
some
risk
in
saying
what
he
thought
the
journalist
could
not
understand
his
scruples
he
thought
christophe
narrow
and
clerical
at
heart
but
he
also
decided
that
christophe
was
afraid
he
said
oh
well
leave
it
to
us
i
will
write
it
myself
you
need
not
bother
about
it
christophe
begged
him
to
say
nothing
but
he
had
no
means
of
restraining
him
besides
the
journalist
declared
that
the
affair
was
not
his
concern
only
the
insult
touched
the
paper
which
had
the
right
to
avenge
itself
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
to
that
all
that
christophe
could
do
was
to
ask
him
on
his
word
of
honor
not
to
abuse
certain
of
his
confidences
which
had
been
made
to
his
friend
and
not
to
the
journalist
the
other
made
no
difficulty
about
that
christophe
was
not
reassured
by
it
he
knew
too
well
how
imprudent
he
had
been
when
he
was
left
alone
he
turned
over
everything
that
he
had
said
and
shuddered
without
hesitating
for
a
moment
he
wrote
to
the
journalist
imploring
him
once
more
not
to
repeat
what
he
had
confided
to
him
the
poor
wretch
repeated
it
in
part
himself
in
the
letter
next
day
as
he
opened
the
paper
with
feverish
haste
the
first
thing
he
read
was
his
story
at
great
length
on
the
front
page
everything
that
he
had
said
on
the
evening
before
was
immeasurably
enlarged
having
suffered
that
peculiar
deformation
which
everything
has
to
suffer
in
its
passage
through
the
mind
of
a
journalist
the
article
attacked
the
grand
duke
and
the
court
with
low
invective
certain
details
which
it
gave
were
too
personal
to
christophe
too
obviously
known
only
to
him
for
the
article
not
to
be
attributed
to
him
in
its
entirety
christophe
was
crushed
by
this
fresh
blow
as
he
read
a
cold
sweat
came
out
on
his
face
when
he
had
finished
he
was
dumfounded
he
wanted
to
rush
to
the
office
of
the
paper
but
his
mother
withheld
him
not
unreasonably
being
fearful
of
his
violence
he
was
afraid
of
it
himself
he
felt
that
if
he
went
there
he
would
do
something
foolish
and
he
stayed
and
did
a
very
foolish
thing
he
wrote
an
indignant
letter
to
the
journalist
in
which
he
reproached
him
for
his
conduct
in
insulting
terms
disclaimed
the
article
and
broke
with
the
party
the
disclaimer
did
not
appear
christophe
wrote
again
to
the
paper
demanding
that
his
letter
should
be
published
they
sent
him
a
copy
of
his
first
letter
written
on
the
night
of
the
interview
and
confirming
it
they
asked
if
they
were
to
publish
that
too
he
felt
that
he
was
in
their
hands
thereupon
he
unfortunately
met
the
indiscreet
interviewer
in
the
street
he
could
not
help
telling
him
of
his
contempt
for
him
next
day
the
paper
without
a
spark
of
shame
published
an
insulting
paragraph
about
the
servants
of
the
court
who
even
when
they
are
dismissed
remain
servants
and
are
incapable
of
being
free
a
few
allusions
to
recent
events
left
no
room
for
doubt
that
christophe
was
meant
when
it
became
evident
to
everybody
that
christophe
had
no
single
support
there
suddenly
cropped
up
a
host
of
enemies
whose
existence
he
had
never
suspected
all
those
whom
he
had
offended
directly
or
indirectly
either
by
personal
criticism
or
by
attacking
their
ideas
and
taste
now
took
the
offensive
and
avenged
themselves
with
interest
the
general
public
whom
christophe
had
tried
to
shake
out
of
their
apathy
were
quite
pleased
to
see
the
insolent
young
man
who
had
presumed
to
reform
opinion
and
disturb
the
rest
of
people
of
property
taken
down
a
peg
christophe
was
in
the
water
everybody
did
their
best
to
duck
him
they
did
not
come
down
upon
him
all
at
once
one
tried
first
to
spy
out
the
land
christophe
made
no
response
and
he
struck
more
lustily
others
followed
and
then
the
whole
gang
of
them
some
joined
in
the
sport
simply
for
fun
like
puppies
who
think
it
funny
to
leave
their
mark
in
inappropriate
places
they
were
the
flying
squadron
of
incompetent
journalists
who
knowing
nothing
try
to
hide
their
ignorance
by
belauding
the
victors
and
belaboring
the
vanquished
others
brought
the
weight
of
their
principles
and
they
shouted
like
deaf
people
nothing
was
left
of
anything
when
they
had
passed
they
were
the
critics
with
the
criticism
which
kills
fortunately
for
christophe
he
did
not
read
the
papers
a
few
devoted
friends
took
care
to
send
him
the
most
insulting
but
he
left
them
in
a
heap
on
his
desk
and
never
thought
of
opening
them
it
was
only
towards
the
end
of
it
that
his
eyes
were
attracted
by
a
great
red
mark
round
an
article
he
read
that
his
were
like
the
roaring
of
a
wild
beast
that
his
symphonies
seemed
to
have
come
from
a
madhouse
that
his
art
was
hysterical
his
harmony
spasmodic
as
a
change
from
the
dryness
of
his
heart
and
the
emptiness
of
his
thought
the
critic
who
was
well
known
ended
with
these
words
herr
krafft
as
a
journalist
has
lately
given
astounding
proof
of
his
style
and
taste
which
roused
irresistible
merriment
in
musical
circles
he
was
then
given
the
friendly
advice
rather
to
devote
himself
to
composition
but
the
latest
products
of
his
muse
have
shown
that
this
advice
though
was
bad
herr
krafft
should
certainly
devote
himself
to
journalism
after
reading
the
article
which
prevented
christophe
working
the
whole
morning
naturally
he
began
to
look
for
the
other
hostile
papers
and
became
utterly
demoralized
but
louisa
who
had
a
mania
for
moving
everything
lying
about
by
way
of
tidying
up
had
already
burned
them
he
was
irritated
at
first
and
then
comforted
and
he
held
out
the
last
of
the
papers
to
her
and
said
that
she
had
better
do
the
same
with
that
other
rebuffs
hurt
him
more
a
quartette
which
he
had
sent
in
manuscript
to
a
society
at
frankfort
was
rejected
unanimously
and
returned
without
explanation
an
overture
which
an
orchestra
at
cologne
seemed
disposed
to
perform
was
returned
after
a
month
as
unplayable
but
the
worst
of
all
was
inflicted
on
him
by
an
orchestral
society
in
the
town
the
euphrat
its
conductor
was
quite
a
good
musician
but
like
many
conductors
he
had
no
curiosity
of
mind
he
suffered
or
rather
he
carried
to
extremes
the
laziness
peculiar
to
his
class
which
consists
in
going
on
and
on
investigating
familiar
works
while
it
shuns
any
really
new
work
like
the
plague
he
was
never
tired
of
organizing
beethoven
mozart
or
schumann
festivals
in
conducting
these
works
he
had
only
to
let
himself
be
carried
along
by
the
purring
of
the
familiar
rhythms
on
the
other
hand
contemporary
music
was
intolerable
to
him
he
dared
not
admit
it
and
pretended
to
be
friendly
towards
young
talent
in
fact
whenever
he
was
brought
a
work
built
on
the
old
lines
a
sort
of
of
works
that
had
been
new
fifty
years
before
he
would
receive
it
very
well
and
would
even
produce
it
ostentatiously
and
force
it
upon
the
public
it
did
not
disturb
either
his
effects
or
the
way
in
which
the
public
was
accustomed
to
be
moved
on
the
other
hand
he
was
filled
with
a
mixture
of
contempt
and
hatred
for
anything
which
threatened
to
disturb
that
arrangement
and
put
him
to
extra
trouble
contempt
would
predominate
if
the
innovator
had
no
chance
of
emerging
from
obscurity
but
if
there
were
any
danger
of
his
succeeding
then
hatred
would
predominate
of
course
until
the
moment
when
he
had
gained
an
established
success
christophe
was
not
yet
in
that
position
far
from
it
and
so
he
was
much
surprised
when
he
was
informed
by
indirect
overtures
that
herr
euphrat
would
be
very
glad
to
produce
one
of
his
compositions
it
was
all
the
more
unexpected
as
he
knew
that
the
was
an
intimate
friend
of
brahms
and
others
whom
he
had
maltreated
in
his
criticisms
being
honest
himself
he
credited
his
adversaries
with
the
same
generous
feelings
which
he
would
have
had
himself
he
supposed
that
now
that
he
was
down
they
wished
to
show
him
that
they
were
above
petty
spite
he
was
touched
by
it
he
wrote
effusively
to
herr
euphrat
and
sent
him
a
symphonic
poem
the
conductor
replied
through
his
secretary
coldly
but
politely
acknowledging
the
receipt
of
his
work
and
adding
that
in
accordance
with
the
rules
of
the
society
the
symphony
would
be
given
out
to
the
orchestra
immediately
and
put
to
the
test
of
a
general
rehearsal
before
it
could
be
accepted
for
public
hearing
a
rule
is
a
rule
christophe
had
to
bow
to
it
though
it
was
a
pure
formality
which
served
to
weed
out
the
lucubrations
of
amateurs
which
were
sometimes
a
nuisance
a
few
weeks
later
christophe
was
told
that
his
composition
was
to
be
rehearsed
on
principle
everything
was
done
privately
and
even
the
author
was
not
permitted
to
be
present
at
the
rehearsal
but
by
a
generally
agreed
indulgence
the
author
was
always
admitted
only
he
did
not
show
himself
everybody
knew
it
and
everybody
pretended
not
to
know
it
on
the
appointed
day
one
of
his
friends
brought
christophe
to
the
hall
where
he
sat
at
the
back
of
a
box
he
was
surprised
to
see
that
at
this
private
rehearsal
the
hall
at
least
the
ground
floor
seats
were
almost
all
filled
a
crowd
of
dilettante
idlers
and
critics
moved
about
and
chattered
to
each
other
the
orchestra
had
to
ignore
their
presence
they
began
with
the
brahms
for
alto
chorus
of
male
voices
and
orchestra
on
a
fragment
of
the
im
of
goethe
christophe
who
detested
the
majestic
sentimentality
of
the
work
thought
that
perhaps
the
brahmins
had
introduced
it
politely
to
avenge
themselves
by
forcing
him
to
hear
a
composition
of
which
he
had
written
irreverently
the
idea
made
him
laugh
and
his
good
humour
increased
when
after
the
there
came
two
other
productions
by
known
musicians
whom
he
had
taken
to
task
there
seemed
to
be
no
doubt
about
their
intentions
and
while
he
could
not
help
making
a
face
at
it
he
thought
that
after
all
it
was
quite
fair
tactics
and
failing
the
music
he
appreciated
the
joke
it
even
amused
him
to
applaud
ironically
with
the
audience
which
made
manifest
its
enthusiasm
for
brahms
and
his
like
at
last
it
came
to
christophe
symphony
he
saw
from
the
way
the
orchestra
and
the
people
in
the
hall
were
looking
at
his
box
that
they
were
aware
of
his
presence
he
hid
himself
he
waited
with
the
catch
at
his
heart
which
every
musician
feels
at
the
moment
when
the
conductor
wand
is
raised
and
the
waters
of
the
music
gather
in
silence
before
bursting
their
dam
he
had
never
yet
heard
his
work
played
how
would
the
creatures
of
his
dreams
live
how
would
their
voices
sound
he
felt
their
roaring
within
him
and
he
leaned
over
the
abyss
of
sounds
waiting
fearfully
for
what
should
come
forth
what
did
come
forth
was
a
nameless
thing
a
shapeless
instead
of
the
bold
columns
which
were
to
support
the
front
of
the
building
the
chords
came
crumbling
down
like
a
building
in
ruins
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
the
dust
of
mortar
for
a
moment
christophe
was
not
quite
sure
whether
they
were
really
playing
his
work
he
cast
back
for
the
train
the
rhythm
of
his
thoughts
he
could
not
recognize
it
it
went
on
babbling
and
hiccoughing
like
a
drunken
man
clinging
close
to
the
wall
and
he
was
overcome
with
shame
as
though
he
had
himself
been
seen
in
that
condition
it
was
of
no
avail
to
think
that
he
had
not
written
such
stuff
when
an
idiotic
interpreter
destroys
a
man
thoughts
he
has
always
a
moment
of
doubt
when
he
asks
himself
in
consternation
if
he
is
himself
responsible
for
it
the
audience
never
asks
such
a
question
the
audience
believes
in
the
interpreter
in
the
singers
in
the
orchestra
whom
they
are
accustomed
to
hear
as
they
believe
in
their
newspaper
they
can
not
make
a
mistake
if
they
say
absurd
things
it
is
the
absurdity
of
the
author
this
audience
was
the
less
inclined
to
doubt
because
it
liked
to
believe
christophe
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
the
was
aware
of
the
hash
and
would
stop
the
orchestra
and
begin
again
the
instruments
were
not
playing
together
the
horn
had
missed
his
beat
and
had
come
in
a
bar
too
late
he
went
on
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
stopped
quietly
to
clean
his
instrument
certain
passages
for
the
oboe
had
absolutely
disappeared
it
was
impossible
for
the
most
skilled
ear
to
pick
up
the
thread
of
the
musical
idea
or
even
to
imagine
that
there
was
one
fantastic
instrumentations
humoristic
sallies
became
grotesque
through
the
coarseness
of
the
execution
it
was
lamentably
stupid
the
work
of
an
idiot
of
a
joker
who
knew
nothing
of
music
christophe
tore
his
hair
he
tried
to
interrupt
but
the
friend
who
was
with
him
held
him
back
assuring
him
that
the
must
surely
see
the
faults
of
the
execution
and
would
put
everything
right
that
christophe
must
not
show
himself
and
that
if
he
made
any
remark
it
would
have
a
very
bad
effect
he
made
christophe
sit
at
the
very
back
of
the
box
christophe
obeyed
but
he
beat
his
head
with
his
fists
and
every
fresh
monstrosity
drew
from
him
a
groan
of
indignation
and
misery
the
wretches
the
wretches
he
groaned
and
squeezed
his
hands
tight
to
keep
himself
from
crying
out
now
mingled
with
the
wrong
notes
there
came
up
to
him
the
muttering
of
the
audience
who
were
beginning
to
be
restless
at
first
it
was
only
a
tremor
but
soon
christophe
was
left
without
a
doubt
they
were
laughing
the
musicians
of
the
orchestra
had
given
the
signal
some
of
them
did
not
conceal
their
hilarity
the
audience
certain
then
that
the
music
was
laughable
rocked
with
laughter
this
merriment
became
general
it
increased
at
the
return
of
a
very
rhythmical
motif
which
the
accentuated
in
a
burlesque
fashion
only
the
went
on
through
the
uproar
imperturbably
beating
time
at
last
they
reached
the
end
the
best
things
come
to
an
end
it
was
the
turn
of
the
audience
they
exploded
with
delight
an
explosion
which
lasted
for
several
minutes
some
hissed
others
applauded
ironically
the
wittiest
of
all
shouted
encore
a
bass
voice
coming
from
a
stage
box
began
to
imitate
the
grotesque
motif
other
jokers
followed
suit
and
imitated
it
also
some
one
shouted
author
it
was
long
since
these
witty
folk
had
been
so
highly
entertained
when
the
tumult
was
calmed
down
a
little
the
standing
quite
impassive
with
his
face
turned
towards
the
audience
though
he
was
pretending
not
to
see
it
the
audience
was
still
supposed
to
be
made
a
sign
to
the
audience
that
he
was
about
to
speak
there
was
a
cry
of
ssh
and
silence
he
waited
a
moment
longer
then
his
voice
was
curt
cold
and
cutting
gentlemen
he
said
i
should
certainly
not
have
let
he
played
through
to
the
end
if
i
had
not
wished
to
make
an
example
of
the
gentleman
who
has
dared
to
write
offensively
of
the
great
brahms
that
was
all
and
jumping
down
from
his
stand
he
went
out
amid
cheers
from
the
delighted
audience
they
tried
to
recall
him
the
applause
went
on
for
a
few
minutes
longer
but
he
did
not
return
the
orchestra
went
away
the
audience
decided
to
go
too
the
concert
was
over
it
had
been
a
good
day
christophe
had
gone
already
hardly
had
he
seen
the
wretched
conductor
leave
his
desk
when
he
had
rushed
from
the
box
he
plunged
down
the
stairs
from
the
first
floor
to
meet
him
and
slap
his
face
his
friend
who
had
brought
him
followed
and
tried
to
hold
him
back
but
christophe
brushed
him
aside
and
almost
threw
him
downstairs
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
the
fellow
was
concerned
in
the
trick
which
had
been
played
him
fortunately
for
euphrat
and
himself
the
door
leading
to
the
stage
was
shut
and
his
furious
knocking
could
not
make
them
open
it
however
the
audience
was
beginning
to
leave
the
hall
christophe
could
not
stay
there
he
fled
he
was
in
an
indescribable
condition
he
walked
blindly
waving
his
arms
rolling
his
eyes
talking
aloud
like
a
madman
he
suppressed
his
cries
of
indignation
and
rage
the
street
was
almost
empty
the
concert
hall
had
been
built
the
year
before
in
a
new
neighborhood
a
little
way
out
of
the
town
and
christophe
instinctively
fled
towards
the
country
across
the
empty
fields
in
which
were
a
few
lonely
shanties
and
scaffoldings
surrounded
by
fences
his
thoughts
were
murderous
he
could
have
killed
the
man
who
had
put
such
an
affront
upon
him
alas
and
when
he
had
killed
him
would
there
he
any
change
in
the
animosity
of
those
people
whose
insulting
laughter
was
still
ringing
in
his
ears
they
were
too
many
he
could
do
nothing
against
them
they
were
all
agreed
they
who
were
divided
about
so
many
things
to
insult
and
crush
him
it
was
past
understanding
there
was
hatred
in
them
what
had
he
done
to
them
all
there
were
beautiful
things
in
him
things
to
do
good
and
make
the
heart
big
he
had
tried
to
say
them
to
make
others
enjoy
them
he
thought
they
would
be
happy
like
himself
even
if
they
did
not
like
them
they
should
he
grateful
to
him
for
his
intentions
they
could
if
need
be
show
him
kindly
where
he
had
been
wrong
but
that
they
should
take
such
a
malignant
joy
in
insulting
and
odiously
travestying
his
ideas
in
trampling
them
underfoot
and
killing
him
by
ridicule
how
was
it
possible
in
his
excitement
he
exaggerated
their
hatred
he
thought
it
much
more
serious
than
such
mediocre
people
could
ever
be
he
sobbed
what
have
i
done
to
them
he
choked
he
thought
that
all
was
lost
just
as
he
did
when
he
was
a
child
coming
into
contact
for
the
first
time
with
human
wickedness
and
when
he
looked
about
him
he
suddenly
saw
that
he
had
reached
the
edge
of
the
at
the
very
spot
where
a
few
years
before
his
father
had
been
drowned
and
at
once
he
thought
of
drowning
himself
too
he
was
just
at
the
point
of
making
the
plunge
but
as
he
leaned
over
the
steep
bank
fascinated
by
the
calm
clean
aspect
of
the
water
a
tiny
bird
in
a
tree
by
his
side
began
to
sing
to
sing
madly
he
held
his
breath
to
listen
the
water
murmured
the
ripening
corn
moaned
as
it
waved
under
the
soft
caressing
wind
the
poplars
shivered
behind
the
hedge
on
the
road
out
of
sight
bees
in
hives
in
a
garden
filled
the
air
with
their
scented
music
from
the
other
side
of
the
stream
a
cow
was
chewing
the
cud
and
gazing
with
soft
eyes
a
little
girl
was
sitting
on
a
wall
with
a
light
basket
on
her
shoulders
like
a
little
angel
with
wings
and
she
was
dreaming
and
swinging
her
bare
legs
and
humming
aimlessly
far
away
in
a
meadow
a
white
dog
was
leaping
and
running
in
wide
circles
christophe
leaned
against
a
tree
and
listened
and
watched
the
earth
in
spring
he
was
caught
up
by
the
peace
and
joy
of
these
creatures
he
could
forget
he
could
forget
suddenly
he
clasped
the
tree
with
his
arms
and
leaned
his
cheek
against
it
he
threw
himself
on
the
ground
he
buried
his
face
in
the
grass
he
laughed
nervously
happily
all
the
beauty
the
grace
the
charm
of
life
wrapped
him
round
imbued
his
soul
and
he
sucked
them
up
like
a
sponge
he
thought
why
are
you
so
beautiful
and
they
men
so
ugly
no
matter
he
loved
it
he
loved
it
he
felt
that
he
would
always
love
it
and
that
nothing
could
ever
take
it
from
him
he
held
the
earth
to
his
breast
he
held
life
to
his
breast
i
love
you
you
are
mine
they
can
not
take
you
from
me
let
them
do
what
they
will
let
them
make
me
suffer
suffering
also
is
life
christophe
began
bravely
to
work
again
he
refused
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
men
of
letters
well
named
makers
of
phrases
the
sterile
babblers
journalists
critics
the
exploiters
and
traffickers
of
art
as
for
musicians
he
would
waste
no
more
time
in
battling
with
their
prejudices
and
jealousy
they
did
not
want
him
very
well
he
did
not
want
them
he
had
his
work
to
do
he
would
do
it
the
court
had
given
him
back
his
liberty
he
was
grateful
for
it
he
was
grateful
to
the
people
for
their
hostility
he
could
work
in
peace
louisa
approved
with
all
her
heart
she
had
no
ambition
she
was
not
a
krafft
she
was
like
neither
his
father
nor
his
grandfather
she
did
not
want
honors
or
reputation
for
her
son
she
would
have
liked
him
to
be
rich
and
famous
but
if
those
advantages
could
only
be
bought
at
the
price
of
so
much
unpleasantness
she
much
preferred
not
to
bother
about
them
she
had
been
more
upset
by
christophe
grief
over
his
rupture
with
the
palace
than
by
the
event
itself
and
she
was
heartily
glad
that
he
had
quarreled
with
the
review
and
newspaper
people
she
had
a
peasant
distrust
of
blackened
paper
it
was
only
a
waste
of
time
and
made
enemies
she
had
sometimes
heard
his
young
friends
of
the
review
talking
to
christophe
she
had
been
horrified
by
their
malevolence
they
tore
everything
to
pieces
and
said
horrible
things
about
everybody
and
the
worse
things
they
said
the
better
pleased
they
were
she
did
not
like
them
no
doubt
they
were
very
clever
and
very
learned
but
they
were
not
kind
and
she
was
very
glad
that
christophe
saw
no
more
of
them
she
was
full
of
common
sense
what
good
were
they
to
him
they
may
say
write
and
think
what
they
like
of
me
said
christophe
they
can
not
prevent
my
being
myself
what
do
their
ideas
or
their
art
matter
to
me
i
deny
them
it
is
all
very
fine
to
deny
the
world
but
the
world
is
not
so
easily
denied
by
a
young
man
boasting
christophe
was
sincere
but
he
was
under
illusion
he
did
not
know
himself
he
was
not
a
monk
he
had
not
the
temperament
for
renouncing
the
world
and
besides
he
was
not
old
enough
to
do
so
at
first
he
did
not
suffer
much
he
was
plunged
in
composition
and
while
his
work
lasted
he
did
not
feel
the
want
of
anything
but
when
he
came
to
the
period
of
depression
which
follows
the
completion
of
a
work
and
lasts
until
a
new
work
takes
possession
of
the
mind
he
looked
about
him
and
was
horrified
by
his
loneliness
he
asked
himself
why
he
wrote
while
a
man
is
writing
he
never
asks
himself
that
question
he
must
write
there
is
no
arguing
about
it
and
then
he
finds
himself
with
the
work
that
he
has
begotten
the
great
instinct
which
caused
it
to
spring
forth
is
silent
he
does
not
understand
why
it
was
born
he
hardly
recognizes
it
it
is
almost
a
stranger
to
him
he
longs
to
forget
it
and
that
is
impossible
as
long
as
it
is
not
published
or
played
or
living
its
own
life
in
the
world
till
then
it
is
like
a
child
attached
to
its
mother
a
living
thing
bound
fast
to
his
living
flesh
it
must
be
amputated
at
all
costs
or
it
will
not
live
the
more
christophe
composed
the
more
he
suffered
under
the
weight
of
these
creatures
who
had
sprung
forth
from
himself
and
could
neither
live
nor
die
he
was
haunted
by
them
who
could
deliver
him
from
them
some
obscure
impulse
would
stir
in
these
children
of
his
thoughts
they
longed
desperately
to
break
away
from
him
to
expand
into
other
souls
like
the
quick
and
fruitful
seed
which
the
wind
scatters
over
the
universe
must
he
remain
imprisoned
in
his
sterility
he
raged
against
it
since
every
outlet
theaters
concerts
was
closed
to
him
and
nothing
would
induce
him
to
approach
those
managers
who
had
once
failed
him
there
was
nothing
left
but
for
him
to
publish
his
writings
but
he
could
not
flatter
himself
that
it
would
be
easier
to
find
a
publisher
to
produce
his
work
than
an
orchestra
to
play
it
the
two
or
three
clumsy
attempts
that
he
had
made
were
enough
rather
than
expose
himself
to
another
rebuff
or
to
bargain
with
one
of
these
music
merchants
and
put
up
with
his
patronizing
airs
he
preferred
to
publish
it
at
his
own
expense
it
was
an
act
of
madness
he
had
some
small
savings
out
of
his
court
salary
and
the
proceeds
of
a
few
concerts
but
the
source
from
which
the
money
had
come
was
dried
up
and
it
would
be
a
long
time
before
he
could
find
another
and
he
should
have
been
prudent
enough
to
be
careful
with
his
scanty
funds
which
had
to
help
him
over
the
difficult
period
upon
which
he
was
entering
not
only
did
he
not
do
so
but
as
his
savings
were
not
enough
to
cover
the
expenses
of
publication
he
did
not
shrink
from
getting
into
debt
louisa
dared
not
say
anything
she
found
him
absolutely
unreasonable
and
did
not
understand
how
anybody
could
spend
money
for
the
sake
of
seeing
his
name
on
a
book
but
since
it
was
a
way
of
making
him
be
patient
and
of
keeping
him
with
her
she
was
only
too
happy
for
him
to
have
that
satisfaction
instead
of
offering
the
public
compositions
of
a
familiar
and
undisturbing
kind
in
which
it
could
feel
at
home
christophe
chose
from
among
his
manuscripts
a
suite
very
individual
in
character
which
he
valued
highly
they
were
piano
pieces
mixed
with
some
very
short
and
popular
in
style
others
very
elaborate
and
almost
dramatic
the
whole
formed
a
series
of
impressions
joyous
or
mild
linked
together
naturally
and
written
alternately
for
the
piano
and
the
voice
alone
or
accompanied
for
said
christophe
when
i
dream
i
do
not
always
formulate
what
i
feel
i
suffer
i
am
happy
and
have
no
words
to
say
but
then
comes
a
moment
when
i
must
say
what
i
am
feeling
and
i
sing
without
thinking
of
what
i
am
doing
sometimes
i
sing
only
vague
words
a
few
disconnected
phrases
sometimes
whole
poems
then
i
begin
to
dream
again
and
so
the
day
goes
by
and
i
have
tried
to
give
the
impression
of
a
day
why
these
gathered
impressions
composed
only
of
songs
or
preludes
there
is
nothing
more
false
or
less
harmonious
one
must
try
to
give
the
free
play
of
the
soul
he
had
called
his
suite
the
different
parts
of
the
composition
bore
shortly
indicating
the
succession
of
his
inward
dreams
christophe
had
written
mysterious
dedications
initials
dates
which
only
he
could
understand
as
they
reminded
mm
of
poetic
moments
or
beloved
faces
the
gay
corinne
the
languishing
sabine
and
the
little
unknown
frenchwoman
besides
this
work
he
selected
thirty
of
his
those
which
pleased
him
most
and
consequently
pleased
the
public
least
he
avoided
choosing
the
most
melodious
of
his
melodies
but
he
did
choose
the
most
characteristic
the
public
always
has
a
horror
of
anything
characteristic
characterless
things
are
more
likely
to
please
them
these
were
written
to
poems
of
old
silesian
poets
of
the
seventeenth
century
that
christophe
had
read
by
chance
in
a
popular
collection
and
whose
loyalty
he
had
loved
two
especially
were
dear
to
him
dear
as
brothers
two
creatures
full
of
genius
and
both
had
died
at
thirty
the
charming
paul
fleming
the
traveler
to
the
caucasus
and
to
ispahan
who
preserved
his
soul
pure
loving
and
serene
in
the
midst
of
the
savagery
of
war
the
sorrows
of
life
and
the
corruption
of
his
time
and
johann
christian
günther
the
unbalanced
genius
who
wore
himself
out
in
debauchery
and
despair
casting
his
life
to
the
four
winds
he
had
translated
günther
cries
of
provocation
and
vengeful
irony
against
the
hostile
god
who
overwhelms
his
creatures
his
furious
curses
like
those
of
a
titan
overthrown
hurling
the
thunder
back
against
the
heavens
he
had
selected
fleming
love
songs
to
anemone
and
basilene
soft
and
sweet
as
flowers
and
the
rondo
of
the
stars
the
dancing
song
of
hearts
glad
and
limpid
and
the
calm
heroic
sonnet
to
himself
which
christophe
used
to
recite
as
a
prayer
every
morning
the
smiling
optimism
of
the
pious
paul
gerhardt
also
had
its
charm
for
christophe
it
was
a
rest
for
him
on
recovering
from
his
own
sorrows
he
loved
that
innocent
vision
of
nature
as
god
the
fresh
meadows
where
the
storks
walk
gravely
among
the
tulips
and
white
narcissus
by
little
brooks
singing
on
the
sands
the
transparent
air
wherein
there
pass
the
swallows
and
flying
doves
the
gaiety
of
a
sunbeam
piercing
the
rain
and
the
luminous
sky
smiling
through
the
clouds
and
the
serene
majesty
of
the
evening
the
sweet
peace
of
the
forests
the
cattle
the
bowers
and
the
fields
he
had
had
the
impertinence
to
set
to
music
several
of
those
mystic
canticles
which
are
still
sung
in
protestant
communities
and
he
had
avoided
preserving
the
choral
character
far
from
it
he
had
a
horror
of
it
he
had
given
them
a
free
and
vivacious
character
old
gerhardt
would
have
shuddered
at
the
devilish
pride
which
was
breathed
forth
now
in
certain
lines
of
his
of
the
christian
or
the
pagan
delight
which
made
this
peaceful
stream
of
his
of
bubble
over
like
a
torrent
the
collection
was
published
without
any
regard
for
common
sense
of
course
the
publisher
whom
christophe
paid
for
printing
and
storing
his
had
no
other
claim
to
his
choice
than
that
of
being
his
neighbor
he
was
not
equipped
for
such
important
work
the
printing
went
on
for
months
there
were
mistakes
and
expensive
corrections
christophe
knew
nothing
about
it
and
the
whole
thing
cost
more
by
a
third
than
it
need
have
done
the
expenses
far
exceeded
anything
he
had
anticipated
then
when
it
was
done
christophe
found
an
enormous
edition
on
his
hands
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
the
publisher
had
no
customers
he
took
no
steps
to
circulate
the
work
and
his
apathy
was
quite
in
accord
with
attitude
when
he
asked
him
to
satisfy
his
conscience
to
write
him
a
short
advertisement
of
it
christophe
replied
that
he
did
not
want
any
advertisement
if
his
music
was
good
it
would
speak
for
itself
the
publisher
religiously
respected
his
wishes
he
put
the
edition
away
in
his
warehouse
it
was
well
kept
for
in
six
months
not
a
copy
was
sold
while
he
was
waiting
for
the
public
to
make
up
its
mind
christophe
had
to
find
some
way
of
repairing
the
hole
he
had
made
in
his
means
and
he
could
not
be
nice
about
it
for
he
had
to
live
and
pay
his
debts
not
only
were
his
debts
larger
than
he
had
imagined
but
he
saw
that
the
moneys
on
which
he
had
counted
were
less
than
he
had
thought
had
he
lost
money
without
knowing
it
or
what
was
infinitely
more
probable
had
he
reckoned
up
wrongly
he
had
never
been
able
to
add
correctly
it
did
not
matter
much
why
the
money
was
missing
it
was
missing
without
a
doubt
louisa
had
to
give
her
all
to
help
her
son
he
was
bitterly
remorseful
and
tried
to
pay
her
back
as
soon
as
possible
and
at
all
costs
he
tried
to
get
lessons
though
it
was
painful
to
him
to
ask
and
to
put
up
with
refusals
he
was
out
of
favor
altogether
he
found
it
very
difficult
to
obtain
pupils
again
and
so
when
it
was
suggested
that
he
should
teach
at
a
school
he
was
only
too
glad
it
was
a
institution
the
director
an
astute
gentleman
had
seen
though
he
was
no
musician
how
useful
christophe
might
be
and
how
cheaply
in
his
present
position
he
was
pleasant
and
paid
very
little
when
christophe
ventured
to
make
a
timid
remark
the
director
told
him
with
a
kindly
smile
that
as
he
no
longer
held
an
official
position
he
could
not
very
well
expect
more
it
was
a
sad
task
it
was
not
so
much
a
matter
of
teaching
the
pupils
music
as
of
making
their
parents
and
themselves
believe
that
they
had
learned
it
the
chief
thing
was
to
make
them
able
to
sing
at
the
ceremonies
to
which
the
public
were
admitted
it
did
not
matter
how
it
was
done
christophe
was
in
despair
he
had
not
even
the
consolation
of
telling
himself
as
he
fulfilled
his
task
that
he
was
doing
useful
work
his
conscience
reproached
him
with
it
as
hypocrisy
he
tried
to
give
the
children
more
solid
instruction
and
to
make
them
acquainted
with
and
love
serious
music
but
they
did
not
care
for
it
a
bit
christophe
could
not
succeed
in
making
them
listen
to
it
he
had
no
authority
over
them
in
truth
he
was
not
made
for
teaching
children
he
took
no
interest
in
their
floundering
he
tried
to
explain
to
them
all
at
once
the
theory
of
music
when
he
had
to
give
a
piano
lesson
he
would
set
his
pupil
a
symphony
of
beethoven
which
he
would
play
as
a
duet
with
her
naturally
that
could
not
succeed
he
would
explode
angrily
drive
the
pupil
from
the
piano
and
go
on
playing
alone
for
a
long
time
he
was
just
the
same
with
his
private
pupils
outside
the
school
he
had
not
an
ounce
of
patience
for
instance
he
would
tell
a
young
lady
who
prided
herself
on
her
aristocratic
appearance
and
position
that
she
played
like
a
kitchen
maid
or
he
would
even
write
to
her
mother
and
say
that
he
gave
it
up
that
it
would
kill
him
if
he
went
on
long
bothering
about
a
girl
so
devoid
of
talent
all
of
which
did
not
improve
his
position
his
few
pupils
left
him
he
could
not
keep
any
of
them
more
than
a
few
months
his
mother
argued
with
him
he
would
argue
with
himself
louisa
made
him
promise
that
at
least
he
would
not
break
with
the
school
he
had
joined
for
if
he
lost
that
position
he
did
not
know
what
he
should
do
for
a
living
and
so
he
restrained
himself
in
spite
of
his
disgust
he
was
most
exemplarily
punctual
but
how
could
he
conceal
his
thoughts
when
a
donkey
of
a
pupil
blundered
for
the
tenth
time
in
some
passages
or
when
he
had
to
coach
his
class
for
the
next
concert
in
some
foolish
chorus
for
he
was
not
even
allowed
to
choose
his
programme
his
taste
was
not
trusted
he
was
not
exactly
zealous
about
it
all
and
yet
he
went
stubbornly
on
silent
frowning
only
betraying
his
secret
wrath
by
occasionally
thumping
on
his
desk
and
making
his
pupils
jump
in
their
seats
but
sometimes
the
pill
was
too
bitter
he
could
not
bear
it
any
longer
in
the
middle
of
the
chorus
he
would
interrupt
the
singers
oh
stop
stop
i
play
you
some
wagner
instead
they
asked
nothing
better
they
played
cards
behind
his
back
there
was
always
someone
who
reported
the
matter
to
the
director
and
christophe
would
be
reminded
that
he
was
not
there
to
make
his
pupils
like
music
but
to
make
them
sing
he
received
his
scoldings
with
a
shudder
but
he
accepted
them
he
did
not
want
to
lose
his
work
who
would
have
thought
a
few
years
before
when
his
career
looked
so
assured
and
brilliant
when
he
had
done
nothing
that
he
would
be
reduced
to
such
humiliation
just
as
he
was
beginning
to
be
worth
something
among
the
hurts
to
his
vanity
that
he
came
by
in
his
work
at
the
school
one
of
the
most
painful
was
having
to
call
on
his
colleagues
he
paid
two
calls
at
random
and
they
bored
him
so
that
he
had
not
the
heart
to
go
on
the
two
privileged
persons
were
not
at
all
pleased
about
it
but
the
others
were
personally
affronted
they
all
regarded
christophe
as
their
inferior
in
position
and
intelligence
and
they
assumed
a
patronizing
manner
towards
him
sometimes
he
was
overwhelmed
by
it
for
they
seemed
to
be
so
sure
of
themselves
and
the
opinion
they
had
of
him
that
he
began
to
share
it
he
felt
stupid
with
them
what
could
he
have
found
to
say
to
them
they
were
full
of
their
profession
and
saw
nothing
beyond
it
they
were
not
men
if
only
they
had
been
books
but
they
were
only
notes
to
books
philological
commentaries
christophe
avoided
meeting
them
but
sometimes
he
was
forced
to
do
so
the
director
was
at
home
once
a
month
in
the
afternoon
and
he
insisted
on
all
his
people
being
there
christophe
who
had
cut
the
first
afternoon
without
excuse
in
the
vain
hope
that
his
absence
would
not
be
noticed
was
ever
afterwards
the
object
of
sour
attention
next
time
he
was
lectured
by
his
mother
and
decided
to
go
he
was
as
solemn
about
it
as
though
he
were
going
to
a
funeral
he
found
himself
at
a
gathering
of
the
teachers
of
the
school
and
other
institutions
of
the
town
and
their
wives
and
daughters
they
were
all
huddled
together
in
a
room
too
small
for
them
and
grouped
hierarchically
they
paid
no
attention
to
him
the
group
nearest
him
was
talking
of
pedagogy
and
cooking
all
the
wives
of
the
teachers
had
culinary
recipes
which
they
set
out
with
pedantic
exuberance
and
insistence
the
men
were
no
less
interested
in
these
matters
and
hardly
less
competent
they
were
as
proud
of
the
domestic
talents
of
their
wives
as
they
of
their
learning
christophe
stood
by
a
window
leaning
against
the
wall
not
knowing
how
to
look
now
trying
to
smile
stupidly
now
gloomy
with
a
fixed
stare
and
unmoved
features
and
he
was
bored
to
death
a
little
away
from
him
sitting
in
the
recess
of
the
window
was
a
young
woman
to
whom
nobody
was
talking
and
she
was
as
bored
as
he
they
both
looked
at
the
room
and
not
at
each
other
it
was
only
after
some
time
that
they
noticed
each
other
just
as
they
both
turned
away
to
yawn
both
being
at
the
limit
of
endurance
just
at
that
moment
their
eyes
met
they
exchanged
a
look
of
friendly
understanding
he
moved
towards
her
she
said
in
a
low
voice
are
you
amused
he
turned
his
back
on
the
room
and
looking
out
of
the
window
put
out
his
tongue
she
burst
out
laughing
and
suddenly
waking
up
she
signed
to
him
to
sit
down
by
her
side
they
introduced
themselves
she
was
the
wife
of
professor
reinhart
who
lectured
on
natural
history
at
the
school
and
was
newly
come
to
the
town
where
they
knew
nobody
she
was
not
beautiful
she
had
a
large
nose
ugly
teeth
and
she
lacked
freshness
but
she
had
keen
clever
eyes
and
a
kindly
smile
she
chattered
like
a
magpie
he
answered
her
solemnly
she
had
an
amusing
frankness
and
a
droll
wit
they
laughingly
exchanged
impressions
out
loud
without
bothering
about
the
people
round
them
their
neighbors
who
had
not
deigned
to
notice
their
existence
when
it
would
have
been
charitable
to
help
them
out
of
their
loneliness
now
threw
angry
looks
at
them
it
was
in
bad
taste
to
be
so
much
amused
but
they
did
not
care
what
the
others
might
think
of
them
they
were
taking
their
revenge
in
their
chatter
in
the
end
frau
reinhart
introduced
her
husband
to
christophe
he
was
extremely
ugly
he
had
a
pale
greasy
pockmarked
rather
sinister
face
but
he
looked
very
kind
he
spoke
low
down
in
his
throat
and
pronounced
his
words
sententiously
stammeringly
pausing
between
each
syllable
they
had
been
married
a
few
months
only
and
these
two
plain
people
were
in
love
with
each
other
they
had
an
affectionate
way
of
looking
at
each
other
talking
to
each
other
taking
each
other
hands
in
the
presence
of
everybody
which
was
comic
and
touching
if
one
wanted
anything
the
other
would
want
it
too
and
so
they
invited
christophe
to
go
and
sup
with
them
after
the
reception
christophe
began
jokingly
to
beg
to
be
excused
he
said
that
the
best
thing
to
do
that
evening
would
be
to
go
to
bed
he
was
quite
worn
out
with
boredom
as
tired
as
though
he
had
walked
ten
miles
but
frau
reinhart
said
that
he
could
not
be
left
in
that
condition
it
would
be
dangerous
to
spend
the
night
with
such
gloomy
thoughts
christophe
let
them
drag
him
off
in
his
loneliness
he
was
glad
to
have
met
these
good
people
who
were
not
very
distinguished
in
their
manners
but
were
simple
and
the
reinharts
little
house
was
like
themselves
it
was
a
rather
chattering
a
with
inscriptions
the
furniture
the
utensils
the
china
all
talked
and
went
on
repeating
their
joy
in
seeing
their
charming
guest
asked
after
his
health
and
gave
him
pleasant
and
virtuous
advice
on
the
sofas
which
was
very
hard
was
a
little
cushion
which
murmured
amiably
only
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ein
the
cup
of
coffee
which
was
handed
to
christophe
insisted
on
his
taking
more
just
a
drop
ein
the
plates
seasoned
the
cooking
with
morality
and
otherwise
the
cooking
was
quite
excellent
one
plate
said
think
of
everything
otherwise
no
good
will
come
to
you
another
affection
and
gratitude
please
everybody
ingratitude
pleases
nobody
although
christophe
did
not
smoke
the
on
the
mantelpiece
insisted
on
introducing
itself
to
him
a
little
resting
place
for
burning
cigars
für
brennende
he
wanted
to
wash
his
hands
the
soap
on
the
washstand
said
for
our
charming
guest
unseren
lieben
and
the
sententious
towel
like
a
person
who
has
nothing
to
say
but
thinks
he
must
say
something
all
the
same
gave
him
this
reflection
full
of
good
sense
but
not
very
apposite
that
to
enjoy
the
morning
you
must
rise
early
hat
gold
im
at
length
christophe
dared
not
even
turn
in
his
chair
for
fear
of
hearing
himself
addressed
by
other
voices
coming
from
every
part
of
the
room
he
wanted
to
say
be
silent
you
little
monsters
we
do
understand
each
other
and
he
burst
out
laughing
crazily
and
then
tried
to
explain
to
his
host
and
hostess
that
he
was
thinking
of
the
gathering
at
the
school
he
would
not
have
hurt
them
for
the
world
and
he
was
not
very
sensible
of
the
ridiculous
very
soon
he
grew
accustomed
to
the
loquacious
cordiality
of
these
people
and
their
belongings
he
could
have
tolerated
anything
in
them
they
were
so
kind
they
were
not
tiresome
either
if
they
had
no
taste
they
were
not
lacking
in
intelligence
they
were
a
little
lost
in
the
place
to
which
they
had
come
the
intolerable
susceptibilities
of
the
little
provincial
town
did
not
allow
people
to
enter
it
as
though
it
were
a
mill
without
having
properly
asked
for
the
honor
of
becoming
part
of
it
the
reinharts
had
not
sufficiently
attended
to
the
provincial
code
which
regulated
the
duties
of
new
arrivals
in
the
town
towards
those
who
had
settled
in
it
before
them
reinhart
would
have
submitted
to
it
mechanically
but
his
wife
to
whom
such
drudgery
was
oppressive
she
disliked
being
put
out
postponed
her
duties
from
day
to
day
she
had
selected
those
calls
which
bored
her
least
to
be
paid
first
or
she
had
put
the
others
off
indefinitely
the
distinguished
persons
who
were
comprised
in
the
last
category
choked
with
indignation
at
such
a
want
of
respect
angelica
reinhart
her
husband
called
her
lili
was
a
little
free
in
her
manners
she
could
not
take
on
the
official
tone
she
would
address
her
superiors
in
the
hierarchy
familiarly
and
make
than
go
red
in
the
face
with
indignation
and
if
need
be
she
was
not
afraid
of
contradicting
them
she
had
a
quick
tongue
and
always
had
to
say
whatever
was
in
her
head
sometimes
she
made
extraordinarily
foolish
remarks
at
which
people
laughed
behind
her
back
and
also
she
could
be
malicious
and
that
made
her
mortal
enemies
she
would
bite
her
tongue
as
she
was
saying
rash
things
and
wish
she
had
not
said
them
but
it
was
too
late
her
husband
the
gentlest
and
most
respectful
of
men
would
chide
her
timidly
about
it
she
would
kiss
him
and
say
that
she
was
a
fool
and
that
he
was
right
but
the
next
moment
she
would
break
out
again
and
she
would
always
say
things
at
the
least
suitable
moment
she
would
have
burst
if
she
had
not
said
them
she
was
exactly
the
sort
of
woman
to
get
on
with
christophe
among
the
many
ridiculous
things
which
she
ought
not
to
have
said
and
consequently
was
always
saying
was
her
trick
of
perpetually
comparing
the
way
things
were
done
in
germany
and
the
way
they
were
done
in
france
she
was
a
german
nobody
more
so
but
she
had
been
brought
up
in
alsace
among
french
alsatians
and
she
had
felt
the
attraction
of
latin
civilization
which
so
many
germans
in
the
annexed
countries
even
those
who
seem
the
least
likely
to
feel
it
can
not
resist
perhaps
to
tell
the
truth
the
attraction
had
become
stronger
out
of
a
spirit
of
contradiction
since
angelica
had
married
a
north
german
and
lived
with
him
in
purely
german
society
she
opened
up
her
usual
subject
of
discussion
on
her
first
evening
with
christophe
she
loved
the
pleasant
freedom
of
conversation
in
france
christophe
echoed
her
france
to
him
was
corinne
bright
blue
eyes
smiling
lips
frank
free
manners
a
musical
voice
he
loved
to
know
more
about
it
lili
reinhart
clapped
her
hands
on
finding
herself
so
thoroughly
agreeing
with
christophe
it
is
a
pity
she
said
that
my
little
french
friend
has
gone
but
she
could
not
stand
it
she
has
gone
the
image
of
corinne
was
at
once
blotted
out
as
a
match
going
out
suddenly
makes
the
gentle
glimmer
of
the
stars
shine
out
from
the
dark
sky
another
image
and
other
eyes
appeared
who
asked
christophe
with
a
start
the
little
governess
what
said
frau
reinhart
you
knew
her
too
he
described
her
the
two
portraits
were
identical
you
knew
her
repeated
christophe
oh
tell
me
everything
you
know
about
her
frau
reinhart
began
by
declaring
that
they
were
bosom
friends
and
had
no
secrets
from
each
other
but
when
she
had
to
go
into
detail
her
knowledge
was
reduced
to
very
little
they
had
met
out
calling
frau
reinhart
had
made
advances
to
the
girl
and
with
her
usual
cordiality
had
invited
her
to
come
and
see
her
the
girl
had
come
two
or
three
times
and
they
had
talked
but
the
curious
lili
had
not
so
easily
succeeded
in
finding
out
anything
about
the
life
of
the
little
frenchwoman
the
girl
was
very
reserved
she
had
had
to
worm
her
story
out
of
her
bit
by
bit
frau
reinhart
knew
that
she
was
called
antoinette
jeannin
she
had
no
fortune
and
no
friends
except
a
younger
brother
who
lived
in
paris
and
to
whom
she
was
devoted
she
used
always
to
talk
of
him
he
was
the
only
subject
about
which
she
could
talk
freely
and
lili
reinhart
had
gained
her
confidence
by
showing
sympathy
and
pity
for
the
boy
living
alone
in
paris
without
relations
without
friends
at
a
boarding
school
it
was
partly
to
pay
for
his
education
that
antoinette
had
accepted
a
post
abroad
but
the
two
children
could
not
live
without
each
other
they
wanted
to
be
with
each
other
every
day
and
the
least
delay
in
the
delivery
of
their
letters
used
to
make
them
quite
ill
with
anxiety
antoinette
was
always
worrying
about
her
brother
the
poor
child
could
not
always
manage
to
hide
his
sadness
and
loneliness
from
her
every
one
of
his
complaints
used
to
sound
through
heart
and
seemed
like
to
break
it
the
thought
that
he
was
suffering
used
to
torture
her
and
she
used
often
to
imagine
that
he
was
ill
and
would
not
say
so
frau
reinhart
in
her
kindness
had
often
had
to
rebuke
her
for
her
groundless
fears
and
she
used
to
succeed
in
restoring
her
confidence
for
a
moment
she
had
not
been
able
to
find
out
anything
about
family
or
position
or
her
inner
self
the
girl
was
wildly
shy
and
used
to
draw
into
herself
at
the
first
question
the
little
she
said
showed
that
she
was
cultured
and
intelligent
she
seemed
to
have
a
precocious
knowledge
of
life
she
seemed
to
be
at
once
naïve
and
undeceived
pious
and
disillusioned
she
had
not
been
happy
in
the
town
in
a
tactless
and
unkind
family
she
used
not
to
complain
but
it
was
easy
to
see
that
she
used
to
suffer
frau
reinhart
did
not
exactly
know
why
she
had
gone
it
had
been
said
that
she
had
behaved
badly
angelica
did
not
believe
it
she
was
ready
to
swear
that
it
was
all
a
disgusting
calumny
worthy
of
the
foolish
rotten
town
but
there
had
been
stories
it
did
not
matter
what
did
it
no
said
christophe
bowing
his
head
and
so
she
has
gone
and
what
did
she
say
anything
to
you
when
she
went
ah
said
lili
reinhart
i
had
no
chance
i
had
gone
to
cologne
for
a
few
days
just
then
when
i
came
back
too
late
she
stopped
to
scold
her
maid
who
had
brought
her
lemon
too
late
for
her
tea
and
she
added
sententiously
with
the
solemnity
which
the
true
german
brings
naturally
to
the
performance
of
the
familiar
duties
of
daily
life
too
late
as
one
so
often
is
in
life
it
was
not
clear
whether
she
meant
the
lemon
or
her
interrupted
story
she
went
on
when
i
returned
i
found
a
line
from
her
thanking
me
for
all
i
had
done
and
telling
me
that
she
was
going
she
was
returning
to
paris
she
gave
no
address
and
she
did
not
write
again
not
again
once
more
christophe
saw
her
sad
face
disappear
into
the
night
once
more
he
saw
her
eyes
for
a
moment
just
as
he
had
seen
them
for
the
last
time
looking
at
him
through
the
carriage
window
the
enigma
of
france
was
once
more
set
before
him
more
insistently
than
ever
christophe
never
tired
of
asking
frau
reinhart
about
the
country
which
she
pretended
to
know
so
well
and
frau
reinhart
who
had
never
been
there
was
not
reluctant
to
tell
him
about
it
reinhart
a
good
patriot
full
of
prejudices
against
france
which
he
knew
better
than
his
wife
sometimes
used
to
qualify
her
remarks
when
her
enthusiasm
went
too
far
but
she
would
repeat
her
assertions
only
the
more
vigorously
and
christophe
knowing
nothing
at
all
about
it
backed
her
up
confidently
what
was
more
precious
even
than
lili
reinhart
memories
were
her
books
she
had
a
small
library
of
french
books
school
books
a
few
novels
a
few
volumes
bought
at
random
christophe
greedy
of
knowledge
and
ignorant
of
france
thought
them
a
treasure
when
reinhart
went
and
got
them
for
him
and
put
them
at
his
disposal
he
began
with
volumes
of
select
passages
old
school
books
which
had
been
used
by
lili
reinhart
or
her
husband
in
their
school
days
reinhart
had
assured
him
that
he
must
begin
with
them
if
he
wished
to
find
his
way
about
french
literature
which
was
absolutely
unknown
to
him
christophe
was
full
of
respect
for
those
who
knew
more
than
himself
and
obeyed
religiously
and
that
very
evening
he
began
to
read
he
tried
first
of
all
to
take
stock
of
the
riches
in
his
possession
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
certain
french
writers
namely
barrau
françois
pétis
de
la
croix
frédéric
baudry
émile
delérot
filon
samuel
descombaz
and
prosper
baur
he
read
the
poetry
of
abbé
joseph
reyre
pierre
lachambaudie
the
duc
de
nivernois
andré
van
hasselt
andrieux
madame
colet
princesse

manuel
hugo
millevoye
chênedollé
james
lacour
delâtre
félix
chavannes
known
as
françois
coppée
and
louis
belmontet
christophe
was
lost
drowned
submerged
under
such
a
deluge
of
poetry
and
turned
to
prose
he
found
gustave
de
molinari
fléchier
buisson
mérimée
voltaire
dumas
père
bousseau
mézières
mirabeau
de
mazade
claretie
cortambert
frédéric
ii
and
de
vogüé
the
most
often
quoted
of
french
historians
was
maximilien
schoell
in
the
french
anthology
christophe
found
the
proclamation
of
the
new
german
empire
and
he
read
a
description
of
the
germans
by
de
rougemont
in
which
he
learned
that
german
was
born
to
live
in
the
region
of
the
soul
he
has
not
the
light
noisy
gaiety
of
the
frenchman
his
is
a
great
soul
his
affections
are
tender
and
profound
he
is
indefatigable
in
toil
and
persevering
in
enterprise
there
is
no
more
moral
or
people
germany
has
an
extraordinary
number
of
writers
she
has
the
genius
of
art
while
the
inhabitants
of
other
countries
pride
themselves
on
being
french
english
spanish
the
german
on
the
other
hand
embraces
all
humanity
in
his
love
and
though
its
position
is
the
very
center
of
europe
the
german
nation
seems
to
be
at
once
the
heart
and
the
higher
reason
of
christophe
closed
the
book
he
was
astonished
and
tired
he
thought
the
french
are
good
fellows
but
they
are
not
strong
he
took
another
volume
it
was
on
a
higher
plane
it
was
meant
for
high
schools
musset
occupied
three
pages
and
victor
duray
thirty
lamartine
seven
pages
and
thiers
almost
forty
the
whole
of
the
was
included
or
almost
the
whole
ten
monologues
of
don
diègue
and
rodrigue
had
been
suppressed
because
they
were
too
long
lanfrey
exalted
prussia
against
napoleon
i
and
so
he
had
not
been
cut
down
he
alone
occupied
more
space
than
all
the
great
classics
of
the
eighteenth
century
copious
narrations
of
the
french
defeats
of
had
been
extracted
from
of
zola
neither
montaigne
nor
la
rochefoucauld
nor
la
bruyère
nor
diderot
nor
stendhal
nor
balzac
nor
flaubert
appeared
on
the
other
hand
pascal
who
did
not
appear
in
the
other
book
found
a
place
in
this
as
a
curiosity
and
christophe
learned
by
the
way
that
the
convulsionary
one
of
the
fathers
of
a
girls
school
near
footnote
the
anthologies
of
french
literature
which
borrowed
from
his
friends
the
reinharts
were
i
french
passages
for
the
use
of
secondary
by
hubert
wingerath
director
of
the
of
saint
john
at
strasburg
part
ii
middle
edition
ii
herrig
and
burguy
arranged
by
tendering
director
of
the
of
the
johanneum
brunswick
christophe
was
on
the
point
of
throwing
the
book
away
his
head
was
swimming
he
could
not
see
he
said
to
himself
i
shall
never
get
through
with
it
he
could
not
formulate
any
opinion
he
turned
over
the
leaves
idly
for
hours
without
knowing
what
he
was
reading
he
did
not
read
french
easily
and
when
he
had
labored
to
make
out
a
passage
it
was
almost
always
something
meaningless
and
highfalutin
and
yet
from
the
chaos
there
darted
flashes
of
light
like
rapier
thrusts
words
that
looked
and
stabbed
heroic
laughter
gradually
an
impression
emerged
from
his
first
reading
perhaps
through
the
biased
scheme
of
the
selections
voluntarily
or
involuntarily
the
german
editors
had
selected
those
pieces
of
french
which
could
seem
to
establish
by
the
testimony
of
the
french
themselves
the
failings
of
the
french
and
the
superiority
of
the
germans
but
they
had
no
notion
that
what
they
most
exposed
to
the
eyes
of
an
independent
mind
like
christophe
was
the
surprising
liberty
of
these
frenchmen
who
criticised
everything
in
their
own
country
and
praised
their
adversaries
michelet
praised
frederick
ii
lanfrey
the
english
of
trafalgar
charras
the
prussia
of
no
enemy
of
napoleon
had
ever
dared
to
speak
of
him
so
harshly
nothing
was
too
greatly
respected
to
escape
their
disparagement
even
under
the
great
king
the
previous
poets
had
had
their
freedom
of
speech
molière
spared
nothing
la
fontaine
laughed
at
everything
even
boileau
gibed
at
the
nobles
voltaire
derided
war
flogged
religion
scoffed
at
his
country
moralists
satirists
pamphleteers
comic
writers
they
all
vied
one
with
another
in
gay
or
somber
audacity
want
of
respect
was
universal
the
honest
german
editors
were
sometimes
scared
by
it
they
had
to
throw
a
rope
to
their
consciences
by
trying
to
excuse
pascal
who
lumped
together
cooks
porters
soldiers
and
camp
followers
they
protested
in
a
note
that
pascal
would
not
have
written
thus
if
he
had
been
acquainted
with
the
noble
armies
of
modern
times
they
did
not
fail
to
remind
the
reader
how
happily
lessing
had
corrected
the
fables
of
la
fontaine
by
following
for
instance
the
advice
of
the
genevese
rousseau
and
changing
the
piece
of
cheese
of
master
crow
to
a
piece
of
poisoned
meat
of
which
the
vile
fox
dies
you
never
gain
anything
but
poison
you
cursed
flatterers
they
blinked
at
naked
truth
but
christophe
was
pleased
with
it
he
loved
this
light
here
and
there
he
was
even
a
little
shocked
he
was
not
used
to
such
unbridled
independence
which
looks
like
anarchy
to
the
eyes
even
of
the
freest
of
germans
who
in
spite
of
everything
is
accustomed
to
order
and
discipline
and
he
was
led
astray
by
the
way
of
the
french
he
took
certain
things
too
seriously
and
other
things
which
were
implacable
denials
seemed
to
him
to
be
amusing
paradoxes
no
matter
surprised
or
shocked
he
was
drawn
on
little
by
little
he
gave
up
trying
to
classify
his
impressions
he
passed
from
one
feeling
to
another
he
lived
the
gaiety
of
the
french
stories
chamfort
ségur
dumas
père
mérimée
all
lumped
together
delighted
him
and
every
now
and
then
in
gusts
there
would
creep
forth
from
the
printed
page
the
wild
intoxicating
scent
of
the
revolutions
it
was
nearly
dawn
when
louisa
who
slept
in
the
next
room
woke
up
and
saw
the
light
through
the
chinks
of
christophe
door
she
knocked
on
the
wall
and
asked
if
he
were
a
chair
creaked
on
the
floor
the
door
opened
and
christophe
appeared
pale
in
his
nightgown
with
a
candle
and
a
book
in
his
hand
making
strange
solemn
and
grotesque
gestures
louisa
was
in
terror
and
got
up
in
her
bed
thinking
that
he
was
mad
he
began
to
laugh
and
waving
his
candle
he
declaimed
a
scene
from
molière
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
he
gurgled
with
laughter
he
sat
at
the
foot
of
his
mother
bed
to
take
breath
the
candle
shook
in
his
hand
louisa
was
reassured
and
scolded
him
forcibly
what
is
the
matter
with
you
what
is
it
go
to
bed
my
poor
boy
are
you
going
out
of
your
senses
but
he
began
again
you
must
listen
to
this
and
he
sat
by
her
bedside
and
read
the
play
going
back
to
the
beginning
again
he
seemed
to
see
corinne
he
heard
her
mocking
tones
cutting
and
sonorous
louisa
protested
go
away
go
away
you
will
catch
cold
how
tiresome
you
are
let
me
go
to
sleep
he
went
on
relentlessly
he
raised
his
voice
waved
his
arms
choked
with
laughter
and
he
asked
his
mother
if
she
did
not
think
it
wonderful
louisa
turned
her
back
on
him
buried
herself
in
the
bedclothes
stopped
her
ears
and
said
do
leave
me
alone
but
she
laughed
inwardly
at
hearing
his
laugh
at
last
she
gave
up
protesting
and
when
christophe
had
finished
the
act
and
asked
her
without
eliciting
any
reply
if
she
did
not
think
what
he
had
read
interesting
he
bent
over
her
and
saw
that
she
was
asleep
then
he
smiled
gently
kissed
her
hair
and
stole
back
to
his
own
room
he
borrowed
more
and
more
books
from
the
reinharts
library
there
were
all
sorts
of
books
in
it
christophe
devoured
them
all
he
wanted
so
much
to
love
the
country
of
corinne
and
the
unknown
young
woman
he
had
so
much
enthusiasm
to
get
rid
of
that
he
found
a
use
for
it
in
his
reading
even
in
works
there
were
sentences
and
pages
which
had
the
effect
on
him
of
a
gust
of
fresh
air
he
exaggerated
the
effect
especially
when
he
was
talking
to
frau
reinhart
who
always
went
a
little
better
than
he
although
she
was
as
ignorant
as
a
fish
she
delighted
to
contrast
french
and
german
culture
and
to
decry
the
german
to
the
advantage
of
the
french
just
to
annoy
her
husband
and
to
avenge
herself
for
the
boredom
she
had
to
suffer
in
the
little
town
reinhart
was
really
amused
notwithstanding
his
learning
he
had
stopped
short
at
the
ideas
he
had
learned
at
school
to
him
the
french
were
a
clever
people
skilled
in
practical
things
amiable
talkative
but
frivolous
susceptible
and
boastful
incapable
of
being
serious
or
sincere
or
of
feeling
strongly
a
people
without
music
without
philosophy
without
poetry
except
for
béranger
and
françois
coppée
a
people
of
pathos
much
gesticulation
exaggerated
speech
and
pornography
there
were
not
words
strong
enough
for
the
denunciation
latin
immorality
and
for
want
of
a
better
he
always
came
back
to
which
for
him
as
for
the
majority
of
his
compatriots
had
a
particularly
unpleasant
meaning
and
he
would
end
with
the
usual
couplet
in
praise
of
the
noble
german
people
the
moral
people
herder
has
said
is
distinguished
from
all
other
the
faithful
people
volk
meaning
everything
sincere
faithful
loyal
and
upright
people

of

and

would

they
did
not
get
on
the
less
for
it
they
knew
quite
well
that
they
were
all
three
good
germans
christophe
used
often
to
go
and
talk
dine
and
walk
with
his
new
friends
lili
reinhart
made
much
of
him
and
used
to
cook
dainty
suppers
for
him
she
was
delighted
to
have
the
excuse
for
satisfying
her
own
greediness
she
paid
him
all
sorts
of
sentimental
and
culinary
attentions
for
birthday
she
made
a
cake
on
which
were
twenty
candles
and
in
the
middle
a
little
wax
figure
in
greek
costume
which
was
supposed
to
represent
iphigenia
holding
a
bouquet
christophe
who
was
profoundly
german
in
spite
of
himself
was
touched
by
these
rather
blunt
and
not
very
refined
marks
of
true
affection
the
excellent
reinharts
found
other
more
subtle
ways
of
showing
their
real
friendship
on
his
wife
instigation
reinhart
who
could
hardly
read
a
note
of
music
had
bought
twenty
copies
of
christophe
the
first
to
leave
the
publisher
shop
he
had
sent
them
to
different
parts
of
germany
to
university
acquaintances
he
had
also
sent
a
certain
number
to
the
libraries
of
leipzig
and
berlin
with
which
he
had
dealings
through
his
classbooks
for
the
moment
at
least
their
touching
enterprise
of
which
christophe
knew
nothing
bore
no
fruit
the
which
had
been
scattered
broadcast
seemed
to
miss
fire
nobody
talked
of
them
and
the
reinharts
who
were
hurt
by
this
indifference
were
glad
they
had
not
told
christophe
about
what
they
had
done
for
it
would
have
given
him
more
pain
than
consolation
but
in
truth
nothing
is
lost
as
so
often
appears
in
life
no
effort
is
in
vain
for
years
nothing
happens
then
one
day
it
appears
that
your
idea
has
made
its
way
it
was
impossible
to
be
sure
that
christophe
had
not
reached
the
hearts
of
a
few
good
people
buried
in
the
country
who
were
too
timid
or
too
tired
to
tell
him
so
one
person
wrote
to
him
two
or
three
months
after
the
reinharts
had
sent
them
a
letter
came
for
christophe
it
was
warm
ceremonious
enthusiastic
in
form
and
came
from
a
little
town
in
thuringia
and
was
signed
musikdirektor
professor
peter
it
was
a
great
joy
for
christophe
and
even
greater
for
the
reinharts
when
at
their
house
he
opened
the
letter
which
he
had
left
lying
in
his
pocket
for
two
days
they
read
it
together
reinhart
made
signs
to
his
wife
which
christophe
did
not
notice
he
looked
radiant
until
suddenly
reinhart
saw
his
face
grow
gloomy
and
he
stopped
dead
in
the
middle
of
his
reading
well
why
do
you
stop
he
asked
they
used
the
familiar
christophe
flung
the
letter
on
the
table
angrily
no
it
is
too
much
he
said
what
is
read
he
turned
away
and
went
and
sulked
in
a
corner
reinhart
and
his
wife
read
the
letter
and
could
find
in
it
only
fervent
admiration
i
do
see
he
said
in
astonishment
you
do
see
you
do
see
cried
christophe
taking
the
letter
and
thrusting
it
in
his
face
ca
you
read
do
you
see
that
he
is
a
and
then
reinhart
noticed
that
in
one
sentence
the
compared
christophe
with
those
of
brahms
christophe
moaned
a
friend
i
have
found
a
friend
at
last
and
i
have
hardly
found
him
when
i
have
lost
him
the
comparison
revolted
him
if
they
had
let
him
he
would
have
replied
with
a
stupid
letter
or
perhaps
upon
reflection
he
would
have
thought
himself
very
prudent
and
generous
in
not
replying
at
all
fortunately
the
reinharts
were
amused
by
his
and
kept
him
from
committing
any
further
absurdity
they
succeeded
in
making
him
write
a
letter
of
thanks
but
the
letter
written
reluctantly
was
cold
and
constrained
the
enthusiasm
of
peter
schulz
was
not
shaken
by
it
he
sent
two
or
three
more
letters
brimming
over
with
affection
christophe
was
not
a
good
correspondent
and
although
he
was
a
little
reconciled
to
his
unknown
friend
by
the
sincerity
and
real
sympathy
which
he
could
feel
behind
his
words
he
let
the
correspondence
drop
schulz
wrote
no
more
christophe
never
thought
about
him
he
now
saw
the
reinharts
every
day
and
frequently
several
times
a
day
they
spent
almost
all
the
evenings
together
after
spending
the
day
alone
in
concentration
he
had
a
physical
need
of
talking
of
saying
everything
that
was
in
his
mind
even
if
he
were
not
understood
and
of
laughing
with
or
without
reason
of
expanding
and
stretching
himself
he
played
for
them
having
no
other
means
of
showing
his
gratitude
he
would
sit
at
the
piano
and
play
for
hours
together
frau
reinhart
was
no
musician
and
she
had
difficulty
in
keeping
herself
from
yawning
but
she
sympathized
with
christophe
and
pretended
to
be
interested
in
everything
he
played
reinhart
was
not
much
more
of
a
musician
than
his
wife
but
was
sometimes
touched
quite
materially
by
certain
pieces
of
music
certain
passages
certain
bars
and
then
he
would
be
violently
moved
sometimes
even
to
tears
and
that
seemed
silly
to
him
the
rest
of
the
time
he
felt
nothing
it
was
just
music
to
him
that
was
the
general
rule
he
was
never
moved
except
by
the
least
good
passages
of
a
composition
absolutely
insignificant
passages
both
of
them
persuaded
themselves
that
they
understood
christophe
and
christophe
tried
to
pretend
that
it
was
so
every
now
and
then
he
would
be
seized
by
a
wicked
desire
to
make
fun
of
them
he
would
lay
traps
for
them
and
play
things
without
any
meaning
inapt
and
he
would
let
them
think
that
he
had
composed
them
then
when
they
had
admired
it
he
would
tell
them
what
it
was
then
they
would
grow
wary
and
when
christophe
played
them
a
piece
with
an
air
of
mystery
they
would
imagine
that
he
was
trying
to
catch
them
again
and
they
would
criticise
it
christophe
would
let
them
go
on
and
back
them
up
and
argue
that
such
music
was
worthless
and
then
he
would
break
out
rascals
you
are
right
it
is
my
own
he
would
be
as
happy
as
a
boy
at
having
taken
them
in
frau
reinhart
would
be
cross
and
come
and
give
him
a
little
slap
but
he
would
laugh
so
that
they
would
laugh
with
him
they
did
not
pretend
to
be
infallible
and
as
they
had
no
leg
to
stand
on
lili
reinhart
would
criticise
everything
and
her
husband
would
praise
everything
and
so
they
were
certain
that
one
or
other
of
them
would
always
be
in
agreement
with
christophe
for
the
rest
it
was
not
so
much
the
musician
that
attracted
them
in
christophe
as
the
boy
with
his
affectionate
ways
and
true
reality
of
life
the
ill
that
they
had
heard
spoken
of
him
had
rather
disposed
them
in
his
favor
like
him
they
were
rather
oppressed
by
the
atmosphere
of
the
little
town
like
him
they
were
frank
they
judged
for
themselves
and
they
regarded
him
as
a
great
baby
not
very
clever
in
the
ways
of
life
and
the
victim
of
his
own
frankness
christophe
was
not
under
many
illusions
concerning
his
new
friends
and
it
made
him
sad
to
think
that
they
did
not
understand
the
depths
of
his
character
and
that
they
would
never
understand
it
but
he
was
so
much
deprived
of
friendship
and
he
stood
in
such
sore
need
of
it
that
he
was
infinitely
grateful
to
them
for
wanting
to
like
him
a
little
he
had
learned
wisdom
in
his
experiences
of
the
last
year
he
no
longer
thought
he
had
the
right
to
be
overwise
two
years
earlier
he
would
not
have
been
so
patient
he
remembered
with
amusement
and
remorse
his
severe
judgment
of
the
honest
and
tiresome
eulers
alas
how
wisdom
had
grown
in
him
he
sighed
a
little
a
secret
voice
whispered
yes
but
for
how
long
that
made
him
smile
and
consoled
him
a
little
what
would
he
not
have
given
to
have
a
friend
one
friend
who
would
understand
him
and
share
his
soul
but
although
he
was
still
young
he
had
enough
experience
of
the
world
to
know
that
his
desire
was
one
of
those
which
are
most
difficult
to
realize
in
life
and
that
he
could
not
hope
to
be
happier
than
the
majority
of
the
true
artists
who
had
gone
before
him
he
had
learned
the
histories
of
some
of
them
certain
books
borrowed
from
the
reinharts
had
told
him
about
the
terrible
trials
through
which
the
german
musicians
of
the
seventeenth
century
had
passed
and
the
calmness
and
resolution
with
which
one
of
these
great
souls
the
greatest
of
all
the
heroic
schutz
had
striven
as
unshakably
he
went
on
his
way
in
the
midst
of
wars
and
burning
towns
and
provinces
ravaged
by
the
plague
with
his
country
invaded
trampled
underfoot
by
the
hordes
of
all
europe
and
worst
of
all
broken
worn
out
degraded
by
misfortune
making
no
fight
indifferent
to
everything
longing
only
for
rest
he
thought
with
such
as
example
what
right
has
any
man
to
complain
they
had
no
audience
they
had
no
future
they
wrote
for
themselves
and
god
what
they
wrote
one
day
would
perhaps
be
destroyed
by
the
next
and
yet
they
went
on
writing
and
they
were
not
sad
nothing
made
them
lose
their
intrepidity
their
joviality
they
were
satisfied
with
their
song
they
asked
nothing
of
life
but
to
live
to
earn
their
daily
bread
to
express
their
ideas
and
to
find
a
few
honest
men
simple
true
not
artists
who
no
doubt
did
not
understand
them
but
had
confidence
in
them
and
won
their
confidence
in
return
how
dared
he
have
demanded
more
than
they
there
is
a
minimum
of
happiness
which
it
is
permitted
to
demand
but
no
man
has
the
right
to
more
it
rests
with
a
man
self
to
gain
the
surplus
of
happiness
not
with
others
such
thoughts
brought
him
new
serenity
and
he
loved
his
good
friends
the
reinharts
the
more
for
them
he
had
no
idea
that
even
this
affection
was
to
be
denied
him
he
reckoned
without
the
malevolence
of
small
towns
they
are
tenacious
in
their
spite
all
the
more
tenacious
because
their
spite
is
aimless
a
healthy
hatred
which
knows
what
it
wants
is
appeased
when
it
has
achieved
its
end
but
men
who
are
mischievous
from
boredom
never
lay
down
their
arms
for
they
are
always
bored
christophe
was
a
natural
prey
for
their
want
of
occupation
he
was
beaten
without
a
doubt
but
he
was
bold
enough
not
to
seem
crushed
he
did
not
bother
anybody
but
then
he
did
not
bother
about
anybody
he
asked
nothing
they
were
impotent
against
him
he
was
happy
with
his
new
friends
and
indifferent
to
anything
that
was
said
or
thought
of
him
that
was
frau
reinhart
roused
even
more
irritation
her
open
friendship
with
christophe
in
the
face
of
the
whole
town
seemed
like
his
attitude
to
be
a
defiance
of
public
opinion
but
the
good
lili
reinhart
defied
nothing
and
nobody
she
had
no
thought
to
provoke
others
she
did
what
she
thought
fit
without
asking
anybody
else
advice
that
was
the
worst
provocation
all
their
doings
were
watched
they
had
no
idea
of
it
he
was
extravagant
she
and
both
even
wanting
in
prudence
when
they
went
out
together
or
even
at
home
in
the
evening
when
they
leaned
over
the
balcony
talking
and
laughing
they
drifted
innocently
into
a
familiarity
of
speech
and
manner
which
could
easily
supply
food
for
calumny
one
morning
christophe
received
an
anonymous
letter
he
was
accused
in
basely
insulting
terms
of
being
frau
reinhart
lover
his
arms
fell
by
his
sides
he
had
never
had
the
least
thought
of
love
or
even
of
flirtation
with
her
he
was
too
honest
he
had
a
puritanical
horror
of
adultery
the
very
idea
of
such
a
dirty
sharing
gave
him
a
physical
and
moral
feeling
of
nausea
to
take
the
wife
of
a
friend
would
have
been
a
crime
in
his
eyes
and
lili
reinhart
would
have
been
the
last
person
in
the
world
with
whom
he
could
have
been
tempted
to
commit
such
an
offense
the
poor
woman
was
not
beautiful
and
he
would
not
have
had
even
the
excuse
of
passion
he
went
to
his
friends
ashamed
and
embarrassed
they
also
were
embarrassed
each
of
them
had
received
a
similar
letter
but
they
had
not
dared
to
tell
each
other
and
all
three
of
them
were
on
their
guard
and
watched
each
other
and
dared
not
move
or
speak
and
they
just
talked
nonsense
if
lili
reinhart
natural
carelessness
took
the
ascendant
for
a
moment
or
if
she
began
to
laugh
and
talk
wildly
suddenly
a
look
from
her
husband
or
christophe
would
stop
her
dead
the
letter
would
cross
her
mind
she
would
stop
in
the
middle
of
a
familiar
gesture
and
grow
uneasy
christophe
and
reinhart
were
in
the
same
plight
and
each
of
them
was
thinking
do
the
others
know
however
they
said
nothing
to
each
other
and
tried
to
go
on
as
though
nothing
had
happened
but
the
anonymous
letters
went
on
growing
more
and
mores
insulting
and
dirty
they
were
plunged
into
a
condition
of
depression
and
intolerable
shame
they
hid
themselves
when
they
received
the
letters
and
had
not
the
strength
to
burn
them
unopened
they
opened
them
with
trembling
hands
and
as
they
unfolded
the
letters
their
hearts
would
sink
and
when
they
read
what
they
feared
to
read
with
some
new
variation
on
the
same
theme
the
injurious
and
ignoble
inventions
of
a
mind
bent
on
causing
a
hurt
they
wept
in
silence
they
racked
their
brains
to
discover
who
the
wretch
might
be
who
so
persistently
persecuted
one
day
frau
reinhart
at
the
end
of
her
letter
confessed
the
persecution
of
which
she
was
the
victim
to
her
husband
and
with
tears
in
his
eyes
he
confessed
that
he
was
suffering
in
the
same
way
should
they
mention
it
to
christophe
they
dared
not
but
they
had
to
warn
him
to
make
him
be
at
the
first
words
that
frau
reinhart
said
to
him
with
a
blush
she
saw
to
her
horror
that
christophe
had
also
received
letters
such
utter
malignance
appalled
them
frau
reinhart
had
no
doubt
that
the
whole
town
was
in
the
secret
instead
of
helping
each
other
they
only
undermined
each
other
fortitude
they
did
not
know
what
to
do
christophe
talked
of
breaking
somebody
head
but
whose
and
besides
that
would
be
to
justify
the
calumny
inform
the
police
of
the
letters
that
would
make
their
insinuations
public
pretend
to
ignore
them
it
was
no
longer
possible
their
friendly
relations
were
now
disturbed
it
was
useless
for
reinhart
to
have
absolute
faith
in
the
honesty
of
his
wife
and
christophe
he
suspected
them
in
spite
of
himself
he
felt
that
his
suspicions
were
shameful
and
absurd
and
tried
hard
not
to
pay
any
heed
to
them
and
to
leave
christophe
and
his
wife
alone
together
but
he
suffered
and
his
wife
saw
that
he
was
suffering
it
was
even
worse
for
her
she
had
never
thought
of
flirting
with
christophe
any
more
than
he
had
thought
of
it
with
her
the
calumnious
letters
brought
her
imperceptibly
to
the
ridiculous
idea
that
after
all
christophe
was
perhaps
in
love
with
her
and
although
he
was
never
anywhere
near
showing
any
such
feeling
for
her
she
thought
she
must
defend
herself
not
by
referring
directly
to
it
but
by
clumsy
precautions
which
christophe
did
not
understand
at
first
though
when
he
did
understand
he
was
beside
himself
it
was
so
stupid
that
it
made
him
laugh
and
cry
at
the
same
time
he
in
love
with
the
honest
little
woman
kind
enough
as
she
was
but
plain
and
common
and
to
think
that
she
should
believe
it
and
that
he
could
not
deny
it
and
tell
her
and
her
husband
come
there
is
no
danger
be
calm
but
no
he
could
not
offend
these
good
people
and
besides
he
was
beginning
to
think
that
if
she
held
out
against
being
loved
by
him
it
was
because
she
was
secretly
on
the
point
of
loving
him
the
anonymous
letters
had
had
the
fine
result
of
having
given
him
so
foolish
and
fantastic
an
idea
the
situation
had
become
at
once
so
painful
and
so
silly
that
it
was
impossible
for
this
to
go
on
besides
lili
reinhart
who
in
spite
of
her
brave
words
had
no
strength
of
character
lost
her
head
in
the
face
of
the
dumb
hostility
of
the
little
town
they
made
shamefaced
excuses
for
not
meeting
frau
reinhart
was
unwell
reinhart
was
busy
they
were
going
away
for
a
few
days
clumsy
lies
which
were
always
unmasked
by
chance
which
seemed
to
take
a
malicious
pleasure
in
doing
so
christophe
was
more
frank
and
said
let
us
part
my
friends
we
are
not
strong
enough
the
reinharts
but
they
were
happier
when
the
breach
was
made
the
town
had
its
triumph
this
time
christophe
was
quite
alone
it
had
robbed
him
of
his
last
breath
of
air
the
affection
however
humble
without
which
no
heart
can
live
iii
deliverance
he
had
no
one
all
his
friends
had
disappeared
his
dear
gottfried
who
had
come
to
his
aid
in
times
of
difficulty
and
whom
now
he
so
sorely
needed
had
gone
some
months
before
this
time
forever
one
evening
in
the
summer
of
the
last
year
a
letter
in
large
handwriting
bearing
the
address
of
a
distant
village
had
informed
louisa
that
her
brother
had
died
upon
one
of
his
vagabond
journeys
which
the
little
peddler
had
insisted
on
making
in
spite
of
his
ill
health
he
was
buried
there
in
the
cemetery
of
the
place
the
last
manly
and
serene
friendship
which
could
have
supported
christophe
had
been
swallowed
up
he
was
left
alone
with
his
old
mother
who
cared
nothing
for
his
ideas
could
only
love
him
and
not
understand
him
about
him
was
the
immense
plain
of
germany
the
green
ocean
at
every
attempt
to
climb
out
of
it
he
only
slipped
back
deeper
than
ever
the
hostile
town
watched
him
drown
and
as
he
was
struggling
a
light
flashed
upon
him
in
the
middle
of
the
night
the
image
of
hassler
the
great
musician
whom
he
had
loved
so
much
when
he
was
a
child
his
fame
shone
over
all
germany
now
he
remembered
the
promises
that
hassler
had
made
him
then
and
he
clung
to
this
piece
of
wreckage
in
desperation
hassler
could
save
him
hassler
must
save
him
what
was
he
asking
not
help
nor
money
nor
material
assistance
of
any
kind
nothing
but
understanding
hassler
had
been
persecuted
like
him
hassler
was
a
free
man
he
would
understand
a
free
man
whom
german
mediocrity
was
pursuing
with
its
spite
and
trying
to
crush
they
were
fighting
the
same
battle
he
carried
the
idea
into
execution
as
soon
as
it
occurred
to
him
he
told
his
mother
that
he
would
be
away
for
a
week
and
that
very
evening
he
took
the
train
for
the
great
town
in
the
north
of
germany
where
hassler
was
he
could
not
wait
it
was
a
last
effort
to
breathe
hassler
was
famous
his
enemies
had
not
disarmed
but
his
friends
cried
that
he
was
the
greatest
musician
present
past
and
future
he
was
surrounded
by
partisans
and
detractors
who
were
equally
absurd
as
he
was
not
of
a
very
firm
character
he
had
been
embittered
by
the
last
and
mollified
by
the
first
he
devoted
his
energy
to
writing
things
to
annoy
his
critics
and
make
them
cry
out
he
was
like
an
urchin
playing
pranks
these
pranks
were
often
in
the
most
detestable
taste
not
only
did
he
devote
his
prodigious
talent
to
musical
eccentricities
which
made
the
hair
of
the
pontiffs
stand
on
end
but
he
showed
a
perverse
predilection
for
queer
themes
bizarre
subjects
and
often
for
equivocal
and
scabrous
situations
in
a
word
for
everything
which
could
offend
ordinary
good
sense
and
decency
he
was
quite
happy
when
the
people
howled
and
the
people
did
not
fail
him
even
the
emperor
who
dabbled
in
art
as
every
one
knows
with
the
insolent
presumption
of
upstarts
and
princes
regarded
hassler
fame
as
a
public
scandal
and
let
no
opportunity
slip
of
showing
his
contemptuous
indifference
to
his
impudent
works
hassler
was
enraged
and
delighted
by
such
august
opposition
which
had
almost
become
a
consecration
for
the
advanced
paths
in
german
art
and
went
on
smashing
windows
at
every
new
folly
his
friends
went
into
ecstasies
and
cried
that
he
was
a
genius
hassler
coterie
was
chiefly
composed
of
writers
painters
and
decadent
critics
who
certainly
had
the
merit
of
representing
the
party
of
revolt
against
the
reaction
always
a
menace
in
north
germany
of
the
pietistic
spirit
and
state
morality
but
in
the
struggle
the
independence
had
been
carried
to
a
pitch
of
absurdity
of
which
they
were
unconscious
for
if
many
of
them
were
not
lacking
in
a
rude
sort
of
talent
they
had
little
intelligence
and
less
taste
they
could
not
rise
above
the
fastidious
atmosphere
which
they
had
created
and
like
all
cliques
they
had
ended
by
losing
all
sense
of
real
life
they
legislated
for
themselves
and
hundreds
of
fools
who
read
their
reviews
and
gulped
down
everything
they
were
pleased
to
promulgate
their
adulation
had
been
fatal
to
hassler
for
it
had
made
him
too
pleased
with
himself
he
accepted
without
examination
every
musical
idea
that
came
into
his
head
and
he
had
a
private
conviction
however
he
might
fall
below
his
own
level
he
was
still
superior
to
that
of
all
other
musicians
and
though
that
idea
was
only
too
true
in
the
majority
of
cases
it
did
not
follow
that
it
was
a
very
fit
state
of
mind
for
the
creation
of
great
works
at
heart
hassler
had
a
supreme
contempt
for
everybody
friends
and
enemies
alike
and
this
bitter
jeering
contempt
was
extended
to
himself
and
life
in
general
he
was
all
the
more
driven
back
into
his
ironic
skepticism
because
he
had
once
believed
in
a
number
of
generous
and
simple
things
as
he
had
not
been
strong
enough
to
ward
off
the
slow
destruction
of
the
passing
of
the
days
nor
hypocritical
enough
to
pretend
to
believe
in
the
faith
he
had
lost
he
was
forever
gibing
at
the
memory
of
it
he
was
of
a
southern
german
nature
soft
and
indolent
not
made
to
resist
excess
of
fortune
or
misfortune
of
heat
or
cold
needing
a
moderate
temperature
to
preserve
its
balance
he
had
drifted
insensibly
into
a
lazy
enjoyment
of
life
he
loved
good
food
heavy
drinking
idle
lounging
and
sensuous
thoughts
his
whole
art
smacked
of
these
things
although
he
was
too
gifted
for
the
flashes
of
his
genius
not
still
to
shine
forth
from
his
lax
music
which
drifted
with
the
fashion
no
one
was
more
conscious
than
himself
of
his
decay
in
truth
he
was
the
only
one
to
be
conscious
of
it
at
rare
moments
which
naturally
he
avoided
besides
he
was
misanthropic
absorbed
by
his
fearful
moods
his
egoistic
preoccupations
his
concern
about
his
health
he
was
indifferent
to
everything
which
had
formerly
excited
his
enthusiasm
or
hatred
such
was
the
man
to
whom
christophe
came
for
assistance
with
what
joy
and
hope
he
arrived
one
cold
wet
morning
in
the
town
wherein
then
lived
the
man
who
symbolized
for
him
the
spirit
of
independence
in
his
art
he
expected
words
of
friendship
and
encouragement
from
him
words
that
he
needed
to
help
him
to
go
on
with
the
ungrateful
inevitable
battle
which
every
true
artist
has
to
wage
against
the
world
until
he
breathes
his
last
without
even
for
one
day
laying
down
his
arms
for
as
schiller
has
said
only
relation
with
the
public
of
which
a
man
never
repents
is
christophe
was
so
impatient
that
he
just
left
his
bag
at
the
first
hotel
he
came
to
near
the
station
and
then
ran
to
the
theater
to
find
out
address
hassler
lived
some
way
from
the
center
of
the
town
in
one
of
the
suburbs
christophe
took
an
electric
train
and
hungrily
ate
a
roll
his
heart
thumped
as
he
approached
his
goal
the
district
in
which
hassler
had
chosen
his
house
was
almost
entirely
built
in
that
strange
new
architecture
into
which
young
germany
has
thrown
an
erudite
and
deliberate
barbarism
struggling
laboriously
to
have
genius
in
the
middle
of
the
commonplace
town
with
its
straight
characterless
streets
there
suddenly
appeared
egyptian
hypogea
norwegian
chalets
cloisters
bastions
exhibition
pavilions
houses
fakirs
buried
in
the
ground
with
expressionless
faces
with
only
one
enormous
eye
dungeon
gates
ponderous
gates
iron
hoops
golden
cryptograms
on
the
panes
of
grated
windows
belching
monsters
over
the
front
door
blue
porcelain
tiles
plastered
on
in
most
unexpected
places
variegated
mosaics
representing
adam
and
eve
roofs
covered
with
tiles
of
jarring
colors
houses
like
citadels
with
castellated
walls
deformed
animals
on
the
roofs
no
windows
on
one
side
and
then
suddenly
close
to
each
other
gaping
holes
square
red
angular
triangular
like
wounds
great
stretches
of
empty
wall
from
which
suddenly
there
would
spring
a
massive
balcony
with
one
window
a
balcony
supported
by
nibelungesque
caryatides
balconies
from
which
there
peered
through
the
stone
balustrade
two
pointed
heads
of
old
men
bearded
and
mermen
of
boecklin
on
the
front
of
one
of
these
prisons
a
pharaohesque
mansion
low
and
with
two
naked
giants
at
the
gate
the
architect
had
written
let
the
artist
show
his
universe
which
never
was
and
yet
will
ever
be
welt
zeige
der
künstler
die
niemals
war
noch
jemals
sein
christophe
was
absorbed
by
the
idea
of
seeing
hassler
and
looked
with
the
eyes
of
amazement
and
under
no
attempt
to
understand
he
reached
the
house
he
sought
one
of
the
simplest
in
a
carolingian
style
inside
was
rich
luxury
commonplace
enough
on
the
staircase
was
the
heavy
atmosphere
of
hot
air
there
was
a
small
lift
which
christophe
did
not
use
as
he
wanted
to
gain
time
to
prepare
himself
for
his
call
by
going
up
the
four
flights
of
stairs
slowly
with
his
legs
giving
and
his
heart
thumping
with
his
excitement
during
that
short
ascent
his
former
interview
with
hassler
his
childish
enthusiasm
the
image
of
his
grandfather
were
as
clearly
in
his
mind
as
though
it
had
all
been
yesterday
it
was
nearly
eleven
when
he
rang
the
bell
he
was
received
by
a
sharp
maid
with
a
manner
who
looked
at
him
impertinently
and
began
to
say
that
herr
hassler
could
not
see
him
as
herr
hassler
was
tired
then
the
naïve
disappointment
expressed
in
christophe
face
amused
her
for
after
making
an
unabashed
scrutiny
of
him
from
head
to
foot
she
softened
suddenly
and
introduced
him
to
hassler
study
and
said
she
would
go
and
see
if
herr
hassler
would
receive
him
thereupon
she
gave
him
a
little
wink
and
closed
the
door
on
the
walls
were
a
few
impressionist
paintings
and
some
gallant
french
engravings
of
the
eighteenth
century
for
hassler
pretended
to
some
knowledge
of
all
the
arts
and
manet
and
watteau
were
joined
together
in
his
taste
in
accordance
with
the
prescription
of
his
coterie
the
same
mixture
of
styles
appeared
in
the
furniture
and
a
very
fine
louis
xv
bureau
was
surrounded
by
new
art
armchairs
and
an
oriental
divan
with
a
mountain
of
cushions
the
doors
were
ornamented
with
mirrors
and
japanese
covered
the
shelves
and
the
mantelpiece
on
which
stood
a
bust
of
hassler
in
a
bowl
on
a
round
table
was
a
profusion
of
photographs
of
singers
female
admirers
and
friends
with
witty
remarks
and
enthusiastic
interjections
the
bureau
was
incredibly
untidy
the
piano
was
open
the
shelves
were
dusty
and
cigars
were
lying
about
everywhere
in
the
next
room
christophe
heard
a
cross
voice
grumbling
it
was
answered
by
the
shrill
tones
of
the
little
maid
it
was
dear
that
hassler
was
not
very
pleased
at
having
to
appear
it
was
clear
also
that
the
young
woman
had
decided
that
hassler
should
appear
and
she
answered
him
with
extreme
familiarity
and
her
shrill
voice
penetrated
the
walls
christophe
was
rather
upset
at
hearing
some
of
the
remarks
she
made
to
her
master
but
hassler
did
not
seem
to
mind
on
the
contrary
it
rather
seemed
as
though
her
impertinence
amused
him
and
while
he
went
on
growling
he
chaffed
the
girl
and
took
a
delight
in
exciting
her
at
last
christophe
heard
a
door
open
and
still
growling
and
chaffing
hassler
came
shuffling
he
entered
christophe
heart
sank
he
recognized
him
would
to
god
he
had
not
it
was
hassler
and
yet
it
was
not
he
he
still
had
his
great
smooth
brow
his
face
as
unwrinkled
as
that
of
a
babe
but
he
was
bald
stout
yellowish
his
lower
lip
drooped
a
little
his
mouth
looked
bored
and
sulky
he
hunched
his
shoulders
buried
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
open
waistcoat
old
shoes
flopped
on
his
feet
his
shirt
was
bagged
above
his
trousers
which
he
had
not
finished
buttoning
he
looked
at
christophe
with
his
sleepy
eyes
in
which
there
was
no
light
as
the
young
man
murmured
his
name
he
bowed
automatically
said
nothing
nodded
towards
a
chair
and
with
a
sigh
sank
down
on
the
divan
and
piled
the
cushions
about
himself
christophe
repeated
i
have
already
had
the
honor
you
were
kind
enough
my
name
is
christophe
krafft
hassler
lay
back
on
the
divan
with
his
legs
crossed
his
lands
clasped
together
on
his
right
knee
which
he
held
up
to
his
chin
as
he
replied
i
do
remember
christophe
throat
went
dry
and
he
tried
to
remind
him
of
their
former
meeting
under
any
circumstances
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
him
to
talk
of
memories
so
intimate
now
it
was
torture
for
him
he
bungled
his
sentences
could
not
find
words
said
absurd
things
which
made
him
blush
hassler
let
him
flounder
on
and
never
ceased
to
look
at
him
with
his
vague
indifferent
eyes
when
christophe
had
reached
the
end
of
his
story
hassler
went
on
rocking
his
knee
in
silence
for
a
moment
as
though
he
were
waiting
for
christophe
to
go
on
then
he
said
yes
that
does
not
make
us
young
again
and
stretched
his
legs
after
a
yawn
he
added
i
beg
pardon
did
not
sleep
supper
at
the
theater
last
night
and
yawned
again
christophe
hoped
that
hassler
would
make
some
reference
to
what
he
had
just
told
him
but
hassler
whom
the
story
had
not
interested
at
all
said
nothing
about
it
and
he
did
not
ask
christophe
anything
about
his
life
when
he
had
done
yawning
he
asked
have
you
been
in
berlin
long
i
arrived
this
morning
said
christophe
ah
said
hassler
without
any
surprise
what
hotel
he
did
not
seem
to
listen
to
the
reply
but
got
up
lazily
and
pressed
an
electric
bell
allow
me
he
said
the
little
maid
appeared
with
her
impertinent
manner
kitty
said
he
are
you
trying
to
make
me
go
without
breakfast
this
morning
you
do
think
i
am
going
to
bring
it
here
while
you
have
some
one
with
you
why
not
he
said
with
a
wink
and
a
nod
in
christophe
direction
he
feeds
my
mind
i
must
feed
my
body
are
you
ashamed
to
have
some
one
watching
you
eat
like
an
animal
in
a
menagerie
instead
of
being
angry
hassler
began
to
laugh
and
corrected
her
like
a
domestic
animal
he
went
on
but
do
bring
it
i
eat
my
shame
with
it
christophe
saw
that
hassler
was
making
no
attempt
to
find
out
what
he
was
doing
and
tried
to
lead
the
conversation
back
he
spoke
of
the
difficulties
of
provincial
life
of
the
mediocrity
of
the
people
the
and
of
his
own
isolation
he
tried
to
interest
him
in
his
moral
distress
but
hassler
was
sunk
deep
in
the
divan
with
his
head
lying
back
on
a
cushion
and
his
eyes
half
closed
and
let
him
go
on
talking
without
even
seeming
to
listen
or
he
would
raise
his
eyelids
for
a
moment
and
pronounce
a
few
coldly
ironical
words
some
ponderous
jest
at
the
expense
of
provincial
people
which
cut
short
christophe
attempts
to
talk
more
intimately
kitty
returned
with
the
breakfast
tray
coffee
butter
ham
etc
she
put
it
down
crossly
on
the
desk
in
the
middle
of
the
untidy
papers
christophe
waited
until
she
had
gone
before
he
went
on
with
his
sad
story
which
he
had
such
difficulty
in
continuing
hassler
drew
the
tray
towards
himself
he
poured
himself
out
some
coffee
and
sipped
at
it
then
in
a
familiar
and
cordial
though
rather
contemptuous
way
he
stopped
christophe
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
to
ask
if
he
would
take
a
cup
christophe
refused
he
tried
to
pick
up
the
thread
of
his
sentence
but
he
was
more
and
more
nonplussed
and
did
not
know
what
he
was
saying
he
was
distracted
by
the
sight
of
hassler
with
his
plate
under
his
chin
like
a
child
gorging
pieces
of
bread
and
butter
and
slices
of
ham
which
he
held
in
his
fingers
however
he
did
succeed
in
saying
that
he
composed
that
he
had
had
an
overture
in
the
of
hebbel
performed
hassler
listened
absently
what
he
asked
christophe
repeated
the
title
so
so
ah
good
good
said
hassler
dipping
his
bread
and
his
fingers
into
his
cup
that
was
all
christophe
was
discouraged
and
was
on
the
point
of
getting
up
and
going
but
he
thought
of
his
long
journey
in
vain
and
summoning
up
all
his
courage
he
murmured
a
proposal
that
he
should
play
some
of
his
works
to
hassler
at
the
first
mention
of
it
hassler
stopped
him
no
no
i
do
know
anything
about
it
he
said
with
his
chaffing
and
rather
insulting
irony
besides
i
have
the
time
tears
came
to
christophe
eyes
but
he
had
vowed
not
to
leave
until
he
had
hassler
opinion
about
his
work
he
said
with
a
mixture
of
confusion
and
anger
i
beg
your
pardon
but
you
promised
once
to
hear
me
i
came
to
see
you
for
that
from
the
other
end
of
germany
you
shall
hear
me
hassler
who
was
not
used
to
such
ways
looked
at
the
awkward
young
man
who
was
furious
blushing
and
near
tears
that
amused
him
and
wearily
shrugging
his
shoulders
he
pointed
to
the
piano
and
said
with
an
air
of
comic
resignation
well
then
there
you
are
on
that
he
lay
back
on
his
divan
like
a
man
who
is
going
to
sleep
smoothed
out
his
cushions
put
them
under
his
outstretched
arms
half
closed
his
eyes
opened
them
for
a
moment
to
take
stock
of
the
size
of
the
roll
of
music
which
christophe
had
brought
from
one
of
his
pockets
gave
a
little
sigh
and
lay
back
to
listen
listlessly
christophe
was
intimidated
and
mortified
but
he
began
to
play
it
was
not
long
before
hassler
opened
his
eyes
and
ears
with
the
professional
interest
of
the
artist
who
is
struck
in
spite
of
himself
by
a
beautiful
thing
at
first
he
said
nothing
and
lay
still
but
his
eyes
became
less
dim
and
his
sulky
lips
moved
then
he
suddenly
woke
up
growling
his
surprise
and
approbation
he
only
gave
inarticulate
interjections
but
the
form
of
them
left
no
doubt
as
to
his
feelings
and
they
gave
christophe
an
inexpressible
pleasure
hassler
forgot
to
count
the
number
of
pages
that
had
been
played
and
were
left
to
be
played
when
christophe
had
finished
a
piece
he
said
go
on
go
on
he
was
beginning
to
use
human
language
that
good
good
he
exclaimed
to
himself
famous
awfully
famous
famos
but
damme
he
growled
in
astonishment
what
is
it
he
had
risen
on
his
seat
was
stretching
for
wind
making
a
trumpet
with
his
hand
talking
to
himself
laughing
with
pleasure
or
at
certain
odd
harmonies
just
putting
out
his
tongue
as
though
to
moisten
his
lips
an
unexpected
modulation
had
such
an
effect
on
him
that
he
got
up
suddenly
with
an
exclamation
and
came
and
sat
at
the
piano
by
christophe
side
he
did
not
seem
to
notice
that
christophe
was
there
he
was
only
concerned
with
the
music
and
when
the
piece
was
finished
he
took
the
book
and
began
to
read
the
page
again
then
the
following
pages
and
went
on
ejaculating
his
admiration
and
surprise
as
though
he
had
been
alone
in
the
room
the
devil
he
said
where
did
the
little
beast
find
that
he
pushed
christophe
away
with
his
shoulders
and
himself
played
certain
passages
he
had
a
charming
touch
on
the
piano
very
soft
caressing
and
light
christophe
noticed
his
fine
long
hands
which
were
a
little
morbidly
aristocratic
and
out
of
keeping
with
the
rest
hassler
stopped
at
certain
chords
and
repeated
them
winking
and
clicking
with
his
tongue
he
hummed
with
his
lips
imitating
the
sounds
of
the
instruments
and
went
on
interspersing
the
music
with
his
apostrophes
in
which
pleasure
and
annoyance
were
mingled
he
could
not
help
having
a
secret
initiative
an
unavowed
jealousy
and
at
the
same
time
he
greedily
enjoyed
it
all
although
he
went
on
talking
to
himself
as
though
christophe
did
not
exist
christophe
blushing
with
pleasure
could
not
help
taking
exclamations
to
himself
and
he
explained
what
he
had
tried
to
do
at
first
hassler
seemed
not
to
pay
any
attention
to
what
the
young
man
was
saying
and
went
on
thinking
out
loud
then
something
that
christophe
said
struck
him
and
he
was
silent
with
his
eyes
still
fixed
on
the
music
which
he
turned
over
as
he
listened
without
seeming
to
hear
christophe
grew
more
and
more
excited
and
at
last
he
plumped
into
confidence
and
talked
with
naïve
enthusiasm
about
his
projects
and
his
life
hassler
was
silent
and
as
he
listened
he
slipped
hack
into
his
irony
he
had
let
christophe
take
the
book
from
his
hands
with
his
elbow
on
the
rack
of
the
piano
and
his
hand
on
his
forehead
he
looked
at
christophe
who
was
explaining
his
work
with
youthful
ardor
and
eagerness
and
he
smiled
bitterly
as
he
thought
of
his
own
beginning
his
own
hopes
and
of
christophe
hopes
and
all
the
disappointments
that
lay
in
wait
for
him
christophe
spoke
with
his
eyes
cast
down
fearful
of
losing
the
thread
of
what
he
had
to
say
hassler
silence
encouraged
him
he
felt
that
hassler
was
watching
him
and
not
missing
a
word
that
he
said
and
he
thought
he
had
broken
the
ice
between
them
and
he
was
glad
at
heart
when
he
had
finished
he
shyly
raised
his
head
confidently
too
and
looked
at
hassler
all
the
joy
welling
in
him
was
frozen
on
the
instant
like
too
early
birds
when
he
saw
the
gloomy
mocking
eyes
that
looked
into
his
without
kindness
he
was
silent
after
an
icy
moment
hassler
spoke
dully
he
had
changed
once
more
he
affected
a
sort
of
harshness
towards
the
young
man
he
teased
him
cruelly
about
his
plans
his
hopes
of
success
as
though
he
were
trying
to
chaff
himself
now
that
he
had
recovered
himself
he
set
himself
coldly
to
destroy
his
faith
in
life
his
faith
in
art
his
faith
in
himself
bitterly
he
gave
himself
as
an
example
speaking
of
his
actual
works
in
an
insulting
fashion
he
said
that
is
what
these
swine
want
do
you
think
there
are
ten
people
in
the
world
who
love
music
is
there
a
single
one
there
is
myself
said
christophe
emphatically
hassler
looked
at
him
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
wearily
you
will
be
like
the
rest
you
will
do
as
the
rest
have
done
you
will
think
of
success
of
amusing
yourself
like
the
rest
and
you
will
be
right
christophe
tried
to
protest
but
hassler
cut
him
short
he
took
the
music
and
began
bitterly
to
criticise
the
works
which
he
had
first
been
praising
not
only
did
he
harshly
pick
out
the
real
carelessness
the
mistakes
in
writing
the
faults
of
taste
or
of
expression
which
had
escaped
the
young
man
but
he
made
absurd
criticisms
criticisms
which
might
have
been
made
by
the
most
narrow
and
antiquated
of
musicians
from
which
he
himself
hassler
had
had
to
suffer
all
his
life
he
asked
what
was
the
sense
of
it
all
he
did
not
even
criticise
he
denied
it
was
as
though
he
were
trying
desperately
to
efface
the
impression
that
the
music
had
made
on
him
in
spite
of
himself
christophe
was
horrified
and
made
no
attempt
to
reply
how
could
he
reply
to
absurdities
which
he
blushed
to
hear
on
the
lips
of
a
man
whom
he
esteemed
and
loved
besides
hassler
did
not
listen
to
him
he
stopped
at
that
stopped
dead
with
the
book
in
his
hands
shut
no
expression
in
his
eyes
and
his
lips
drawn
down
in
bitterness
at
last
he
said
as
though
he
had
once
more
forgotten
christophe
presence
ah
the
worst
misery
of
all
is
that
there
is
not
a
single
man
who
can
understand
you
christophe
was
racked
with
emotion
he
turned
suddenly
laid
his
hand
on
hassler
and
with
love
in
his
heart
he
repeated
there
is
myself
but
hassler
did
not
move
his
hand
and
if
something
stirred
in
his
heart
for
a
moment
at
that
boyish
cry
no
light
shone
in
his
dull
eyes
as
they
looked
at
christophe
irony
and
evasion
were
in
the
ascendant
he
made
a
ceremonious
and
comic
little
bow
in
acknowledgment
honored
he
said
he
was
thinking
do
you
though
do
you
think
i
have
lost
my
life
for
you
he
got
up
threw
the
book
on
the
piano
and
went
with
his
long
spindle
legs
and
sat
on
the
divan
again
christophe
had
divined
his
thoughts
and
had
felt
the
savage
insult
in
them
and
he
tried
proudly
to
reply
that
a
man
does
not
need
to
be
understood
by
everybody
certain
souls
are
worth
a
whole
people
they
think
for
it
and
what
they
have
thought
the
people
have
to
but
hassler
did
not
listen
to
him
he
had
fallen
back
into
his
apathy
caused
by
the
weakening
of
the
life
slumbering
in
him
christophe
too
sane
to
understand
the
sudden
change
felt
that
he
had
lost
but
he
could
not
resign
himself
to
losing
after
seeming
to
be
so
near
victory
he
made
desperate
efforts
to
excite
hassler
attention
once
more
he
took
up
his
music
book
and
tried
to
explain
the
reason
for
the
irregularities
which
hassler
had
remarked
hassler
lay
back
on
the
sofa
and
preserved
a
gloomy
silence
he
neither
agreed
nor
contradicted
he
was
only
waiting
for
him
to
finish
christophe
saw
that
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
he
stopped
short
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
he
rolled
up
his
music
and
got
up
hassler
got
up
too
christophe
was
shy
and
ashamed
and
murmured
excuses
hassler
bowed
slightly
with
a
certain
haughty
and
bored
distinction
coldly
held
out
his
hand
politely
and
accompanied
him
to
the
door
without
a
word
of
suggestion
that
he
should
stay
or
come
again
christophe
found
himself
in
the
street
once
more
absolutely
crushed
he
walked
at
random
he
did
not
know
where
he
was
going
he
walked
down
several
streets
mechanically
and
then
found
himself
at
a
station
of
the
train
by
which
he
had
come
he
went
back
by
it
without
thinking
of
what
he
was
doing
he
sank
down
on
the
seat
with
his
arms
and
legs
limp
it
was
impossible
to
think
or
to
collect
his
ideas
he
thought
of
nothing
he
did
not
try
to
think
he
was
afraid
to
envisage
himself
he
was
utterly
empty
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
emptiness
everywhere
about
him
in
that
town
he
could
not
breathe
in
it
the
mists
the
massive
houses
stifled
him
he
had
only
one
idea
to
fly
to
fly
as
quickly
as
possible
as
if
by
escaping
from
the
town
he
would
leave
in
it
the
bitter
disillusion
which
he
had
found
in
it
he
returned
to
his
hotel
it
was
twelve
it
was
two
hours
since
he
had
entered
it
with
what
a
light
shining
in
his
heart
now
it
was
dead
he
took
no
lunch
he
did
not
go
up
to
his
room
to
the
astonishment
of
the
people
of
the
hotel
he
asked
for
his
bill
paid
as
though
he
had
spent
the
night
there
and
said
that
he
was
going
in
vain
did
they
explain
to
him
that
there
was
no
hurry
that
the
train
he
wanted
to
go
by
did
not
leave
for
hours
and
that
he
had
much
better
wait
in
the
hotel
he
insisted
on
going
to
the
station
at
once
he
was
like
a
child
he
wanted
to
go
by
the
first
train
no
matter
which
and
not
to
stay
another
hour
in
the
place
after
the
long
journey
and
all
the
expense
he
had
incurred
although
he
had
taken
his
holiday
not
only
to
see
hassler
but
the
museums
and
to
hear
concerts
and
to
make
certain
acquaintances
he
had
only
one
idea
in
his
head
to
go
he
went
back
to
the
station
as
he
had
been
told
his
train
did
not
leave
for
three
hours
and
also
the
train
was
not
express
for
christophe
had
to
go
by
the
cheapest
class
stopped
on
the
way
christophe
would
have
done
better
to
go
by
the
next
train
which
went
two
hours
later
and
caught
up
the
first
but
that
meant
spending
two
more
hours
in
the
place
and
christophe
could
not
bear
it
he
would
not
even
leave
the
station
while
he
was
a
gloomy
period
of
waiting
in
those
vast
and
empty
halls
dark
and
noisy
where
strange
shadows
were
going
in
and
out
always
busy
always
hurrying
strange
shadows
who
meant
nothing
to
him
all
unknown
to
him
not
one
friendly
face
the
misty
day
died
down
the
electric
lamps
enveloped
in
fog
flushed
the
night
and
made
it
darker
than
ever
christophe
grew
more
and
more
depressed
as
time
went
on
waiting
in
agony
for
the
time
to
go
ten
times
an
hour
he
went
to
look
at
the
train
indicators
to
make
sure
that
he
had
not
made
a
mistake
as
he
was
reading
them
once
more
from
end
to
end
to
pass
the
time
the
name
of
a
place
caught
his
eye
he
thought
he
knew
it
it
was
only
after
a
moment
that
he
remembered
that
it
was
where
old
schulz
lived
who
had
written
him
such
kind
and
enthusiastic
letters
in
his
wretchedness
the
idea
came
to
him
of
going
to
see
his
unknown
friend
the
town
was
not
on
the
direct
line
on
his
way
home
but
a
few
hours
away
by
a
little
local
line
it
meant
a
whole
night
journey
with
two
or
three
changes
and
interminable
waits
christophe
never
thought
about
it
he
decided
suddenly
to
go
he
had
an
instinctive
need
of
clinging
to
sympathy
of
some
sort
he
gave
himself
no
time
to
think
and
telegraphed
to
schulz
to
say
that
he
would
arrive
next
morning
hardly
had
he
sent
the
telegram
than
he
regretted
it
he
laughed
bitterly
at
his
eternal
illusions
why
go
to
meet
a
new
sorrow
but
it
was
done
now
it
was
too
late
to
change
his
mind
these
thoughts
filled
his
last
hour
of
waiting
his
train
at
last
was
ready
he
was
the
first
to
get
into
it
and
he
was
so
childish
that
he
only
began
to
breathe
again
when
the
train
shook
and
through
the
carriage
window
he
could
see
the
outlines
of
the
town
fading
into
the
gray
sky
under
the
heavy
downpour
of
the
night
he
thought
he
must
have
died
if
he
had
spent
the
night
in
it
at
the
very
hour
about
six
in
the
evening
a
letter
from
hassler
came
for
christophe
at
his
hotel
christophe
visit
stirred
many
things
in
him
the
whole
afternoon
he
had
been
thinking
of
it
bitterly
and
not
without
sympathy
for
the
poor
boy
who
had
come
to
him
with
such
eager
affection
to
be
received
so
coldly
he
was
sorry
for
that
reception
and
a
little
angry
with
himself
in
truth
it
had
been
only
one
of
those
fits
of
sulky
whimsies
to
which
he
was
subject
he
thought
to
make
it
good
by
sending
christophe
a
ticket
for
the
opera
and
a
few
words
appointing
a
meeting
after
the
performance
christophe
never
knew
anything
about
it
when
he
did
not
see
him
hassler
thought
he
is
angry
so
much
the
worse
for
him
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
did
not
wait
long
for
him
next
day
christophe
was
far
away
so
far
that
all
eternity
would
not
have
been
enough
to
bring
them
together
and
they
were
both
separated
forever
peter
schulz
was
he
had
always
had
delicate
health
and
age
had
not
spared
him
he
was
fairly
tail
but
stooping
and
his
head
hung
down
to
his
chest
he
had
a
weak
throat
and
difficulty
in
breathing
asthma
catarrh
bronchitis
were
always
upon
him
and
the
marks
of
the
struggles
he
had
to
make
many
a
night
sitting
up
in
his
bed
bending
forward
dripping
with
sweat
in
the
effort
to
force
a
breath
of
air
into
his
stifling
lungs
were
in
the
sorrowful
lines
on
his
long
thin
face
his
nose
was
long
and
a
little
swollen
at
the
top
deep
lines
came
from
under
his
eyes
and
crossed
his
cheeks
that
were
hollow
from
his
toothlessness
age
and
infirmity
had
not
been
the
only
sculptors
of
that
poor
wreck
of
a
man
the
sorrows
of
life
also
had
had
their
share
in
its
and
in
spite
of
all
he
was
not
sad
there
was
kindness
and
serenity
in
his
large
mouth
but
in
his
eyes
especially
there
was
that
which
gave
a
touching
softness
to
the
old
face
they
were
light
gray
limpid
and
transparent
they
looked
straight
calmly
and
frankly
they
hid
nothing
of
the
soul
its
depths
could
be
read
in
them
his
life
had
been
uneventful
he
had
been
alone
for
years
his
wife
was
dead
she
was
not
very
good
or
very
intelligent
and
she
was
not
at
all
beautiful
but
he
preserved
a
tender
memory
of
her
it
was
years
since
he
had
lost
her
and
he
had
never
once
failed
a
night
to
have
a
little
imaginary
conversation
sad
and
tender
with
her
before
he
went
to
sleep
he
shared
all
his
doings
with
he
had
had
no
children
that
was
the
great
sorrow
of
his
life
he
had
transferred
his
need
of
affection
to
his
pupils
to
whom
he
was
attached
as
a
father
to
his
sons
he
had
found
very
little
return
an
old
heart
can
feel
very
near
to
a
young
heart
and
almost
of
the
same
age
knowing
how
brief
are
the
years
that
lie
between
them
but
the
young
man
never
has
any
idea
of
that
to
him
an
old
man
is
a
man
of
another
age
and
besides
he
is
absorbed
by
his
immediate
anxieties
and
instinctively
turns
away
from
the
melancholy
end
of
all
his
efforts
old
schulz
had
sometimes
found
gratitude
in
his
pupils
who
were
touched
by
the
keen
and
lively
interest
he
took
in
everything
good
or
ill
that
happened
to
them
they
used
to
come
and
see
him
from
time
to
time
they
used
to
write
and
thank
him
when
they
left
the
university
some
of
them
used
to
go
on
writing
occasionally
during
the
years
following
and
then
old
schulz
would
hear
nothing
more
of
them
except
in
the
papers
which
kept
him
informed
of
their
advancement
and
he
would
be
as
glad
of
their
success
as
though
it
was
his
own
he
was
never
hurt
by
their
silence
he
found
a
thousand
excuses
for
it
he
never
doubted
their
affection
and
used
to
ascribe
even
to
the
most
selfish
the
feelings
that
he
had
for
them
but
his
books
were
his
greatest
refuge
they
neither
forgot
nor
deceived
him
the
souls
which
he
cherished
in
them
had
risen
above
the
flood
of
time
they
were
inscrutable
fixed
for
eternity
in
the
love
they
inspired
and
seemed
to
feel
and
gave
forth
once
more
to
those
who
loved
them
he
was
professor
of
æsthetics
and
the
history
of
music
and
he
was
like
an
old
wood
quivering
with
the
songs
of
birds
some
of
these
songs
sounded
very
far
away
they
came
from
the
depths
of
the
ages
but
they
were
not
the
least
sweet
and
mysterious
of
others
were
familiar
and
intimate
to
him
dear
companions
their
every
phrase
reminded
him
of
the
joys
and
sorrows
of
his
past
life
conscious
or
unconscious
for
under
every
day
lit
by
the
light
of
the
sun
there
are
unfolded
other
days
lit
by
a
light
unknown
and
there
were
some
songs
that
he
had
never
yet
heard
songs
which
said
the
things
that
he
had
been
long
awaiting
and
needing
and
his
heart
opened
to
receive
them
like
the
earth
to
receive
rain
and
so
old
schulz
listened
in
the
silence
of
his
solitary
life
to
the
forest
filled
with
birds
and
like
the
monk
of
the
legend
who
slept
in
the
ecstasy
of
the
song
of
the
magic
bird
the
years
passed
over
him
and
the
evening
of
life
was
come
but
still
he
had
the
heart
of
a
boy
of
twenty
he
was
not
only
rich
in
music
he
loved
the
poets
old
and
new
he
had
a
predilection
for
those
of
his
own
country
especially
for
goethe
but
he
also
loved
those
of
other
countries
he
was
a
learned
man
and
could
read
several
languages
in
mind
he
was
a
contemporary
of
herder
and
the
great
the
citizens
of
the
world
of
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
he
had
lived
through
the
years
of
bitter
struggle
which
preceded
and
followed
seventy
and
was
immersed
in
their
vast
idea
and
although
he
adored
germany
he
was
not
vainglorious
about
it
he
thought
with
herder
that
all
vainglorious
men
he
who
is
vainglorious
of
his
nationality
is
the
completest
and
with
schiller
that
is
a
poor
ideal
only
to
write
for
one
and
he
was
timid
of
mind
but
his
heart
was
large
and
ready
to
welcome
lovingly
everything
beautiful
in
the
world
perhaps
he
was
too
indulgent
with
mediocrity
but
his
instinct
never
doubted
as
to
what
was
the
best
and
if
he
was
not
strong
enough
to
condemn
the
sham
artists
admired
by
public
opinion
he
was
always
strong
enough
to
defend
the
artists
of
originality
and
power
whom
public
opinion
disregarded
his
kindness
often
led
him
astray
he
was
fearful
of
committing
any
injustice
and
when
he
did
not
like
what
others
liked
he
never
doubted
but
that
it
must
be
he
who
was
mistaken
and
he
would
manage
to
love
it
it
was
so
sweet
to
him
to
love
love
and
admiration
were
even
more
necessary
to
his
moral
being
than
air
to
his
miserable
lungs
and
so
how
grateful
he
was
to
those
who
gave
him
a
new
opportunity
of
showing
them
christophe
could
have
no
idea
of
what
his
had
been
to
him
he
himself
had
not
felt
them
nearly
so
keenly
when
he
had
written
them
his
songs
were
to
him
only
a
few
sparks
thrown
out
from
his
inner
fire
he
had
cast
them
forth
and
would
cast
forth
others
but
to
old
schulz
they
were
a
whole
world
suddenly
revealed
to
him
a
whole
world
to
be
loved
his
life
had
been
lit
up
by
them
a
year
before
he
had
had
to
resign
his
position
at
the
university
his
health
growing
more
and
more
precarious
prevented
his
lecturing
he
was
ill
and
in
bed
when
wolf
library
had
sent
him
as
usual
a
parcel
of
the
latest
music
they
had
received
and
in
it
were
christophe
he
was
alone
he
was
without
relatives
the
few
that
he
had
had
were
long
since
dead
he
was
delivered
into
the
hands
of
an
old
servant
who
profited
by
his
weakness
to
make
him
do
whatever
she
liked
a
few
friends
hardly
younger
than
himself
used
to
come
and
see
him
from
time
to
time
but
they
were
not
in
very
good
health
either
and
when
the
weather
was
bad
they
too
stayed
indoors
and
missed
their
visits
it
was
winter
then
and
the
streets
were
covered
with
melting
snow
schulz
had
not
seen
anybody
all
day
it
was
dark
in
the
room
a
yellow
fog
was
drawn
over
the
windows
like
a
screen
making
it
impossible
to
see
out
the
heat
of
the
stove
was
thick
and
oppressive
from
the
church
hard
by
an
old
peal
of
bells
of
the
seventeenth
century
chimed
every
quarter
of
an
hour
haltingly
and
horribly
out
of
tune
scraps
of
monotonous
chants
which
seemed
grim
in
their
heartiness
to
schulz
when
he
was
far
from
gay
himself
he
was
coughing
propped
up
by
a
heap
of
pillows
he
was
trying
to
read
montaigne
whom
he
loved
but
now
he
did
not
find
as
much
pleasure
in
reading
him
as
usual
he
let
the
book
fall
and
was
breathing
with
difficulty
and
dreaming
the
parcel
of
music
was
on
the
bed
he
had
not
the
courage
to
open
it
he
was
sad
at
heart
at
last
he
sighed
and
when
he
had
very
carefully
untied
the
string
he
put
on
his
spectacles
and
began
to
read
the
pieces
of
music
his
thoughts
were
elsewhere
always
returning
to
memories
which
he
was
trying
to
thrust
aside
the
book
he
was
holding
was
christophe
his
eyes
fell
on
an
old
canticle
the
words
of
which
christophe
had
taken
from
a
simple
pious
poet
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
had
modernized
them
the
the
christian
wanderer
song
of
paul
gerhardt
o
du
arme
seele
hoff
und
sei
unverzagt
enwarte
nur
der
zeit
so
wirst
du
schon
erblicken
die
sonne
der
schönsten
hope
oh
thou
wretched
soul
hope
hope
and
be
valiant
only
wait
then
wait
and
surely
thou
shalt
see
the
sun
of
lovely
joy
old
schulz
knew
the
ingenuous
words
but
never
had
they
so
spoken
to
him
never
so
nearly
it
was
not
the
tranquil
piety
soothing
and
lulling
the
soul
by
its
monotony
it
was
a
soul
like
his
own
it
was
his
own
soul
but
younger
and
stronger
suffering
striving
to
hope
striving
to
see
and
seeing
joy
his
hands
trembled
great
tears
trickled
down
his
cheeks
he
read
on
auf
gieb
deinem
schmerze
und
sorgen
gute
nacht
lass
fahren
was
das
herze
betrübt
und
traurig
macht
up
up
and
give
thy
sorrow
and
all
thy
cares
and
all
that
grieves
and
saddens
thy
heart
be
put
to
flight
christophe
brought
to
these
thoughts
a
boyish
and
valiant
ardor
and
the
heroic
laughter
in
it
showed
forth
in
the
last
naïve
and
confident
verses
du
doch
nicht
regente
der
alles
führen
soll
gott
sitzt
im
regimente
und
führet
alles
not
thou
thyself
art
ruler
whom
all
things
must
obey
but
god
is
lord
decreeing
all
follows
in
his
way
and
when
there
came
the
superbly
defiant
stanzas
which
in
his
youthful
barbarian
insolence
he
had
calmly
plucked
from
their
original
position
in
the
poem
to
form
the
conclusion
of
his
obgleich
alle
teufel
hier
wollten
wiederstehn
so
wird
doch
ohne
zweifel
gott
nicht
zurücke
gehn
was
er
ihm
vorgenommen
und
was
er
haben
will
das
muss
doch
endlich
rommen
zu
seinem
zweck
und
and
even
though
all
devils
came
and
opposed
his
will
there
were
no
cause
for
doubting
god
will
be
steadfast
still
what
he
has
undertaken
all
his
divine
decree
exactly
as
he
ordered
at
last
shall
all
things
be
then
there
were
transports
of
delight
the
intoxication
of
war
the
triumph
of
a
roman
the
old
man
trembled
all
over
breathlessly
he
followed
the
impetuous
music
like
a
child
dragged
along
by
a
companion
his
heart
beat
tears
trickled
down
he
stammered
oh
my
god
oh
my
god
he
began
to
sob
and
he
laughed
he
was
happy
he
choked
he
was
attacked
by
a
terrible
fit
of
coughing
salome
the
old
servant
ran
to
him
and
she
thought
the
old
man
was
going
to
die
he
went
on
crying
and
coughing
and
saying
over
and
over
again
oh
my
god
my
god
and
in
the
short
moments
of
respite
between
the
fits
of
coughing
he
laughed
a
little
hysterically
salome
thought
he
was
going
mad
when
at
last
she
understood
the
cause
of
his
agitation
she
scolded
him
sharply
how
can
anybody
get
into
such
a
state
over
a
piece
of
foolery
give
it
me
i
shall
take
it
away
you
sha
see
it
again
but
the
old
man
held
firm
in
the
midst
of
his
coughing
and
he
cried
to
salome
to
leave
him
alone
as
she
insisted
he
grew
angry
swore
and
choked
himself
with
his
oaths
never
had
she
known
him
to
be
angry
and
to
stand
out
against
her
she
was
aghast
and
surrendered
her
prize
but
she
did
not
mince
her
words
with
him
she
told
him
he
was
an
old
fool
and
said
that
hitherto
she
had
thought
she
had
to
do
with
a
gentleman
but
that
now
she
saw
her
mistake
that
he
said
things
which
would
make
a
plowman
blush
that
his
eyes
were
starting
from
his
head
and
if
they
had
been
pistols
would
have
killed
her
she
would
have
gone
on
for
a
long
time
in
that
strain
if
he
had
not
got
up
furiously
on
his
pillow
and
shouted
at
her
go
in
so
peremptory
a
voice
that
she
went
slamming
the
door
and
declaring
that
he
might
call
her
as
much
as
he
liked
only
she
would
not
put
herself
out
and
would
leave
him
alone
to
kick
the
bucket
then
silence
descended
upon
the
darkening
room
once
more
the
bells
pealed
placidly
and
grotesquely
through
the
calm
evening
a
little
ashamed
of
his
anger
old
schulz
was
lying
on
his
back
motionless
waiting
breathless
for
the
tumult
in
his
heart
to
die
down
he
was
clasping
the
precious
to
his
breast
and
laughing
like
a
child
he
spent
the
following
days
of
solitude
in
a
sort
of
ecstasy
he
thought
no
more
of
his
illness
of
the
winter
of
the
gray
light
or
of
his
loneliness
everything
was
bright
and
filled
with
love
about
him
so
near
to
death
he
felt
himself
living
again
in
the
young
soul
of
an
unknown
friend
he
tried
to
imagine
christophe
he
did
not
see
him
as
anything
like
what
he
was
he
saw
him
rather
as
an
idealized
version
of
himself
as
he
would
have
liked
to
be
fair
slim
with
blue
eyes
and
a
gentle
quiet
voice
soft
timid
and
tender
he
idealized
everything
about
him
his
pupils
his
neighbors
his
friends
his
old
servant
his
gentle
affectionate
disposition
and
his
want
of
the
critical
faculty
in
part
voluntary
so
as
to
avoid
any
disturbing
thought
surrounded
him
with
serene
pure
images
like
himself
it
was
the
kindly
lying
which
he
needed
if
he
were
to
live
he
was
not
altogether
deceived
by
it
and
often
in
his
bed
at
night
he
would
sigh
as
he
thought
of
a
thousand
little
things
which
had
happened
during
the
day
to
contradict
his
idealism
he
knew
quite
well
that
old
salome
used
to
laugh
at
him
behind
his
back
with
her
gossips
and
that
she
used
to
rob
him
regularly
every
week
he
knew
that
his
pupils
were
obsequious
with
him
while
they
had
need
of
him
and
that
after
they
had
received
all
the
services
they
could
expect
from
him
they
deserted
him
he
knew
that
his
former
colleagues
at
the
university
had
forgotten
him
altogether
since
he
had
retired
and
that
his
successor
attacked
him
in
his
articles
not
by
name
but
by
some
treacherous
allusion
and
by
quoting
some
worthless
thing
that
he
had
said
or
by
pointing
out
his
mistakes
a
procedure
very
common
in
the
world
of
criticism
he
knew
that
his
told
friend
kunz
had
lied
to
him
that
very
afternoon
and
that
he
would
never
see
again
the
books
which
his
other
friend
pottpetschmidt
had
borrowed
for
a
few
days
which
was
hard
for
a
man
who
like
himself
was
as
attached
to
his
books
as
to
living
people
many
other
sad
things
old
or
new
would
come
to
him
he
tried
not
to
think
of
them
but
they
were
there
all
the
same
he
was
conscious
of
them
sometimes
the
memory
of
them
would
pierce
him
like
some
rending
sorrow
oh
my
god
my
god
he
would
groan
in
the
silence
of
the
and
then
fee
would
discard
such
hurtful
thoughts
he
would
deny
them
he
would
try
to
be
confident
and
optimistic
and
to
believe
in
human
truth
and
he
would
believe
how
often
had
his
illusions
been
brutally
destroyed
but
always
others
springing
into
life
always
always
he
could
not
do
without
them
the
unknown
christophe
became
a
fire
of
warmth
to
his
life
the
first
cold
ungracious
letter
which
he
received
from
him
would
have
hurt
him
perhaps
it
did
so
but
he
would
not
admit
it
and
it
gave
him
a
childish
joy
he
was
so
modest
and
asked
so
little
of
men
that
the
little
he
received
from
them
was
enough
to
feed
his
need
of
loving
and
being
grateful
to
them
to
see
christophe
was
a
happiness
which
he
had
never
dared
to
hope
for
for
he
was
too
old
now
to
journey
to
the
banks
of
the
rhine
and
as
for
asking
christophe
to
come
to
him
the
idea
had
never
even
occurred
to
him
christophe
telegram
reached
him
in
the
evening
just
as
he
was
sitting
down
to
dinner
he
did
not
understand
at
first
he
thought
he
did
not
know
the
signature
he
thought
there
was
some
mistake
that
the
telegram
was
not
for
him
he
read
it
three
times
in
his
excitement
his
spectacles
would
not
stay
on
his
nose
the
lamp
gave
a
very
bad
light
and
the
letters
danced
before
his
eyes
when
he
did
understand
he
was
so
overwhelmed
that
he
forgot
to
eat
in
vain
did
salome
shout
at
him
he
could
not
swallow
a
morsel
he
threw
his
napkin
on
the
table
unfolded
a
thing
he
never
did
he
got
up
hobbled
to
get
his
hat
and
stick
and
went
out
old
first
thought
on
receiving
such
good
news
was
to
go
and
share
it
with
others
and
to
tell
his
friends
of
christophe
coming
he
had
two
friends
who
were
music
mad
like
himself
and
he
had
succeeded
in
making
them
share
his
enthusiasm
for
christophe
judge
samuel
kunz
and
the
dentist
oscar
pottpetschmidt
who
was
an
excellent
singer
the
three
old
friends
had
often
talked
about
christophe
and
they
had
played
all
his
music
that
they
could
find
pottpetschmidt
sang
schulz
accompanied
and
kunz
listened
they
would
go
into
ecstasies
for
hours
together
how
often
had
they
said
while
they
were
playing
ah
if
only
krafft
were
here
schulz
laughed
to
himself
in
the
street
for
the
joy
he
had
and
was
going
to
give
night
was
falling
and
kunz
lived
in
a
little
village
half
an
hour
away
from
the
town
but
the
sky
was
clear
it
was
a
soft
april
evening
the
nightingales
were
singing
old
schulz
heart
was
overflowing
with
happiness
he
breathed
without
difficulty
he
walked
like
a
boy
he
strode
along
gleefully
without
heeding
the
stones
against
which
he
kicked
in
the
darkness
he
turned
blithely
into
the
side
of
the
road
when
carts
came
along
and
exchanged
a
merry
greeting
with
the
drivers
who
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
when
the
lamps
showed
the
old
man
climbing
up
the
bank
of
the
road
night
was
fully
come
when
he
reached
kunz
house
a
little
way
out
of
the
village
in
a
little
garden
he
drummed
on
the
door
and
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
a
window
was
opened
and
kunz
appeared
in
alarm
he
peered
through
the
door
and
asked
who
is
there
what
is
it
schulz
was
out
of
breath
but
he
called
gladly
krafft
krafft
is
coming
kunz
did
not
understand
but
he
recognized
the
voice
schulz
what
at
this
hour
what
is
it
schulz
repeated
he
is
coming
morning
what
asked
kunz
still
mystified
krafft
cried
schulz
kunz
pondered
the
word
for
a
moment
then
a
loud
exclamation
showed
that
he
had
understood
i
am
coming
down
he
shouted
the
window
was
closed
he
appeared
on
the
steps
with
a
lamp
in
his
hand
and
came
down
into
the
garden
he
was
a
little
stout
old
man
with
a
large
gray
head
a
red
beard
red
hair
on
his
face
and
hands
he
took
little
steps
and
he
was
smoking
a
porcelain
pipe
this
good
natured
rather
sleepy
little
man
had
never
worried
much
about
anything
for
all
that
the
news
brought
by
schulz
excited
him
he
waved
his
short
arms
and
his
lamp
and
asked
what
is
it
him
is
he
really
coming
morning
said
schulz
triumphantly
waving
the
telegram
the
two
old
friends
went
and
sat
on
a
seat
in
the
arbor
schulz
took
the
lamp
kunz
carefully
unfolded
the
telegram
and
read
it
slowly
in
a
whisper
schulz
read
it
again
aloud
over
his
shoulder
kunz
went
on
looking
at
the
paper
the
marks
on
the
telegram
the
time
when
it
had
been
sent
the
time
when
it
had
arrived
the
number
of
words
then
he
gave
the
precious
paper
back
to
schulz
who
was
laughing
happily
looked
at
him
and
wagged
his
head
and
said
ah
well
ah
well
after
a
moment
thought
and
after
drawing
in
and
expelling
a
cloud
of
tobacco
smoke
he
put
his
hand
on
schulz
knee
and
said
we
must
tell
pottpetschmidt
i
was
going
to
him
said
schulz
i
will
go
with
you
said
kunz
he
went
in
and
put
down
his
lamp
and
came
back
immediately
the
two
old
men
went
on
arm
in
arm
pottpetschmidt
lived
at
the
other
end
of
the
village
schulz
and
kunz
exchanged
a
few
absent
words
but
they
were
both
pondering
the
news
suddenly
kunz
stopped
and
whacked
on
the
ground
with
his
stick
oh
lord
he
said
he
is
away
he
had
remembered
that
pottpetschmidt
had
had
to
go
away
that
afternoon
for
an
operation
at
a
neighboring
town
where
he
had
to
spend
the
night
and
stay
a
day
or
two
schulz
was
distressed
kunz
was
equally
put
out
they
were
proud
of
pottpetschmidt
they
would
have
liked
to
show
him
off
they
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
could
not
make
up
their
minds
what
to
do
what
shall
we
do
what
shall
we
do
asked
kunz
krafft
absolutely
must
hear
pottpetschmidt
said
schulz
he
thought
for
a
moment
and
said
we
must
sent
him
a
telegram
they
went
to
the
post
office
and
together
they
composed
a
long
and
excited
telegram
of
which
it
was
very
difficult
to
understand
a
word
then
they
went
back
schulz
reckoned
he
could
be
here
morning
if
he
took
the
first
train
but
kunz
pointed
out
that
it
was
too
late
and
that
the
telegram
would
not
be
sent
until
the
morning
schulz
nodded
and
they
said
how
unfortunate
they
parted
at
kunz
door
for
in
spite
of
his
friendship
for
schulz
it
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
make
him
commit
the
imprudence
of
accompanying
schulz
outside
the
village
and
even
to
the
end
of
the
road
by
which
he
would
have
had
to
come
back
alone
in
the
dark
it
was
arranged
that
kunz
should
dine
on
the
morrow
with
schulz
schulz
looked
anxiously
at
the
sky
if
only
it
is
fine
and
his
heart
was
a
little
lighter
when
kunz
who
was
supposed
to
have
a
wonderful
knowledge
of
meteorology
looked
gravely
at
the
sky
for
he
was
no
less
anxious
than
schulz
that
christophe
should
see
their
little
countryside
in
all
its
beauty
and
said
it
will
be
fine
schulz
went
along
the
road
to
the
town
and
came
to
it
not
without
having
stumbled
more
than
once
in
the
ruts
and
the
heaps
of
stones
by
the
wayside
before
he
went
home
he
called
in
at
the
confectioner
to
order
a
certain
tart
which
was
the
envy
of
the
town
then
he
went
home
but
just
as
he
was
going
in
he
turned
back
to
go
to
the
station
to
find
out
the
exact
time
at
which
the
train
arrived
at
last
he
did
go
home
and
called
salome
and
discussed
at
length
the
dinner
for
the
morrow
then
only
he
went
to
bed
worn
out
but
he
was
as
excited
as
a
child
on
christmas
eve
and
all
night
he
turned
about
and
about
and
never
slept
a
wink
about
one
in
the
morning
he
thought
of
getting
up
to
go
and
tell
salome
to
cook
a
stewed
carp
for
dinner
for
she
was
marvelously
successful
with
that
dish
he
did
not
tell
her
and
it
was
as
well
no
doubt
but
he
did
get
up
to
arrange
all
sorts
of
things
in
the
room
he
meant
to
give
christophe
he
took
a
thousand
precautions
so
that
salome
should
not
hear
him
for
he
was
afraid
of
being
scolded
all
night
long
he
was
afraid
of
missing
the
train
although
christophe
could
not
arrive
before
eight
he
was
up
very
early
he
first
looked
at
the
sky
kunz
had
not
made
a
mistake
it
was
glorious
weather
on
tiptoe
schulz
went
down
to
the
cellar
he
had
not
been
there
for
a
long
time
fearing
the
cold
and
the
steep
stairs
he
selected
his
best
wines
knocked
his
head
hard
against
the
ceiling
as
he
came
up
again
and
thought
he
was
going
to
choke
when
he
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
with
his
full
basket
then
he
went
to
the
garden
with
his
shears
ruthlessly
he
cut
his
finest
roses
and
the
first
branches
of
lilac
in
flower
then
he
went
up
to
his
room
again
shaved
feverishly
and
cut
himself
more
than
once
he
dressed
carefully
and
set
out
for
the
station
it
was
seven
salome
had
not
succeeded
in
making
him
take
so
much
as
a
drop
of
milk
for
he
declared
that
christophe
would
not
have
had
breakfast
when
he
arrived
and
that
they
would
have
breakfast
together
when
they
came
from
the
station
he
was
at
the
station
of
an
hour
too
soon
he
waited
and
waited
for
christophe
and
finally
missed
him
instead
of
waiting
patiently
at
the
gate
he
went
on
to
the
platform
and
lost
his
head
in
the
crowd
of
people
coming
and
going
in
spite
of
the
exact
information
of
the
telegram
he
had
imagined
god
knows
why
that
christophe
would
arrive
by
a
different
train
from
that
which
brought
him
and
besides
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
christophe
would
get
out
of
a
carriage
he
stayed
on
for
more
than
half
an
hour
waiting
at
the
station
when
christophe
who
had
long
since
arrived
had
gone
straight
to
his
house
as
a
crowning
misfortune
salome
had
just
gone
out
to
do
her
shopping
christophe
found
the
door
shut
the
woman
next
door
whom
salome
had
told
to
say
in
case
any
one
should
ring
that
she
would
soon
be
back
gave
the
message
without
any
addition
to
it
christophe
who
had
not
come
to
see
salome
and
did
not
even
know
who
she
was
thought
it
a
very
bad
joke
he
asked
if
universitäts
schulz
was
not
at
home
he
was
told
yes
but
the
woman
could
not
tell
him
where
he
was
christophe
was
furious
and
went
away
when
old
schulz
came
back
with
a
face
an
ell
long
and
learned
from
salome
who
had
just
come
in
too
what
had
happened
he
was
in
despair
he
almost
wept
he
stormed
at
his
servant
for
her
stupidity
in
going
out
while
he
was
away
and
not
having
even
given
instructions
that
christophe
was
to
be
kept
waiting
salome
replied
in
the
same
way
that
she
could
not
imagine
that
he
would
be
so
foolish
as
to
miss
a
man
whom
he
had
gone
to
meet
but
the
old
man
did
not
stay
to
argue
with
her
without
losing
a
moment
he
hobbled
out
of
doors
again
and
went
off
to
look
for
christophe
armed
with
the
very
vague
clues
given
him
by
his
neighbors
christophe
had
been
offended
at
finding
nobody
and
not
even
a
word
of
excuse
not
knowing
what
to
do
until
the
next
train
he
went
and
walked
about
the
town
and
the
fields
which
he
thought
very
pretty
it
was
a
quiet
reposeful
little
town
sheltered
between
gently
sloping
hills
there
were
gardens
round
the
houses
and
flowers
green
lawns
beautiful
shady
trees
ruins
white
busts
of
bygone
princesses
on
marble
columns
in
the
midst
of
the
trees
with
gentle
and
pleasing
faces
all
about
the
town
were
meadows
and
hills
in
the
flowering
trees
blackbirds
whistled
joyously
for
many
little
orchestras
of
flutes
gay
and
solemn
it
was
not
long
before
christophe
vanished
he
forgot
peter
schulz
the
old
man
rushed
vainly
through
the
streets
questioning
people
he
went
up
to
the
old
castle
on
the
hill
above
the
town
and
was
coming
back
in
despair
when
with
his
keen
eyes
he
saw
some
distance
away
a
man
lying
in
a
meadow
in
the
shade
of
a
thorn
he
did
not
know
christophe
he
had
no
means
of
being
sure
that
it
was
he
besides
the
man
back
was
turned
towards
him
and
his
face
was
half
hidden
in
the
grass
schulz
prowled
along
the
road
and
about
the
meadow
with
his
heart
beating
it
is
he
no
it
is
not
he
he
dared
not
call
to
him
an
idea
struck
him
he
began
to
sing
the
last
bars
of
christophe
auf
up
up
christophe
rose
to
it
like
a
fish
out
of
the
water
and
shouted
the
following
bars
at
the
top
of
his
voice
he
turned
gladly
his
face
was
red
and
there
was
grass
in
his
hair
they
called
to
each
other
by
name
and
ran
together
schulz
strode
across
the
ditch
by
the
road
christophe
leaped
the
fence
they
shook
hands
warmly
and
went
back
to
the
house
laughing
and
talking
loudly
the
old
man
told
how
he
had
missed
him
christophe
who
a
moment
before
had
decided
to
go
away
without
making
any
further
attempt
to
see
schulz
was
at
once
conscious
of
his
kindness
and
simplicity
and
began
to
love
him
before
they
arrived
they
had
already
confided
many
things
to
each
other
when
they
reached
the
house
they
found
kunz
who
having
learned
that
schulz
had
gone
to
look
for
christophe
was
waiting
quietly
they
were
given
au
but
christophe
said
that
he
had
breakfasted
at
an
inn
the
old
man
was
upset
it
was
a
real
grief
to
him
that
first
meal
in
the
place
should
not
have
been
in
his
house
such
small
things
were
of
vast
importance
to
his
fond
heart
christophe
who
understood
him
was
amused
by
it
secretly
and
loved
him
the
more
for
it
and
to
console
him
he
assured
him
that
he
had
appetite
enough
for
two
breakfasts
and
he
proved
his
assertion
all
his
troubles
had
gone
from
his
mind
he
felt
that
he
was
among
true
friends
and
he
began
to
recover
he
told
them
about
his
journey
and
his
rebuffs
in
a
humorous
way
he
looked
like
a
schoolboy
on
holiday
schulz
beamed
and
devoured
him
with
his
eyes
and
laughed
heartily
it
was
not
long
before
conversation
turned
upon
the
secret
bond
that
united
the
three
of
them
christophe
music
schulz
was
longing
to
hear
christophe
play
some
of
his
compositions
but
he
dared
not
ask
him
to
do
so
christophe
was
striding
about
the
room
and
talking
schulz
watched
him
whenever
he
went
near
the
open
piano
and
he
prayed
inwardly
that
he
might
stop
at
it
the
same
thought
was
in
kunz
their
hearts
beat
when
they
saw
him
sit
down
mechanically
on
the
piano
stool
without
stopping
talking
and
then
without
looking
at
the
instrument
run
his
fingers
over
the
keys
at
random
as
schulz
expected
hardly
had
christophe
struck
a
few
arpeggios
than
the
sound
took
possession
of
him
he
went
on
striking
chords
and
still
talking
then
there
came
whole
phrases
and
then
he
stopped
talking
and
began
to
play
the
old
men
exchanged
a
meaning
glance
sly
and
happy
do
you
know
that
asked
christophe
playing
one
of
his
do
i
know
it
said
schulz
delightedly
christophe
said
without
stopping
half
turning
his
head
euh
it
is
not
very
good
your
piano
the
old
man
was
very
contrite
he
begged
pardon
it
is
old
he
said
humbly
it
is
like
myself
christophe
turned
round
and
looked
at
the
old
man
who
seemed
to
be
asking
pardon
for
his
age
took
both
his
hands
and
laughed
he
looked
into
his
honest
eyes
oh
he
said
you
are
younger
than
i
schulz
laughed
aloud
and
spoke
of
his
old
body
and
his
infirmities
ta
ta
ta
said
christophe
i
do
mean
that
i
know
what
i
am
saying
it
is
true
is
it
kunz
they
had
already
suppressed
the
kunz
agreed
emphatically
schulz
tried
to
find
the
same
indulgence
for
his
piano
it
has
still
some
beautiful
notes
he
said
timidly
and
he
touched
or
five
notes
that
were
fairly
true
half
an
octave
in
the
middle
register
of
the
instrument
christophe
understood
that
it
was
an
old
friend
and
he
said
kindly
thinking
of
schulz
eyes
yes
it
still
has
beautiful
eyes
schulz
face
lit
up
he
launched
out
on
an
involved
eulogy
of
his
old
piano
but
he
dropped
immediately
for
christophe
had
begun
to
play
again
followed
christophe
sang
them
softly
with
tears
in
his
eyes
schulz
followed
his
every
movement
with
his
hands
folded
on
his
stomach
kunz
closed
his
eyes
the
better
to
enjoy
it
from
time
to
time
christophe
turned
beaming
towards
the
two
old
men
who
were
absolutely
delighted
and
he
said
with
a
naïve
enthusiasm
at
which
they
never
thought
of
laughing
hein
it
is
beautiful
i
and
this
what
do
you
say
about
this
and
this
again
this
is
the
most
beautiful
of
all
now
i
will
play
you
something
which
will
make
your
hair
curl
as
he
was
finishing
a
dreamy
fragment
the
cuckoo
clock
began
to
call
christophe
started
and
shouted
angrily
kunz
was
suddenly
awakened
and
rolled
his
eyes
fearfully
even
schulz
did
not
understand
at
first
then
when
he
saw
christophe
shaking
his
fist
at
the
calling
bird
and
shouting
to
someone
in
the
name
of
heaven
to
take
the
idiot
and
throw
it
away
the
ventriloquist
specter
he
too
discovered
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
the
noise
was
intolerable
and
he
took
a
chair
and
tried
to
mount
it
to
take
down
the
but
he
nearly
fell
and
kunz
would
not
let
him
try
again
he
called
salome
she
came
without
hurrying
herself
as
usual
and
was
staggered
to
find
the
clock
thrust
into
her
hands
which
christophe
in
his
impatience
had
taken
down
himself
what
am
i
to
do
with
it
she
asked
whatever
you
like
take
it
away
do
let
us
see
it
again
said
schulz
no
less
impatient
than
christophe
he
wondered
how
he
could
have
borne
such
a
horror
for
so
long
salome
thought
that
they
were
surely
all
cracked
the
music
went
on
hours
passed
salome
came
and
announced
that
dinner
was
served
schulz
bade
her
be
silent
she
came
again
ten
minutes
later
then
once
again
ten
minutes
after
that
this
time
she
was
beside
herself
and
boiling
with
rage
while
she
tried
to
look
unperturbed
she
stood
firmly
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
in
spite
of
schulz
desperate
gestures
she
asked
in
a
brazen
voice
do
the
gentlemen
prefer
to
eat
their
dinner
cold
or
burned
it
does
not
matter
to
me
i
only
await
your
orders
schulz
was
confused
by
her
scolding
and
tried
to
retort
but
christophe
burst
out
laughing
kunz
followed
his
example
and
at
length
schulz
laughed
too
salome
satisfied
with
the
effect
she
had
produced
turned
on
her
heels
with
the
air
of
a
queen
who
is
graciously
pleased
to
pardon
her
repentant
subjects
that
a
good
creature
said
christophe
getting
up
from
the
piano
she
is
right
there
is
nothing
so
intolerable
as
an
audience
arriving
in
the
middle
of
a
concert
they
sat
at
table
there
was
an
enormous
and
delicious
repast
schulz
had
touched
salome
vanity
and
she
only
asked
an
excuse
to
display
her
art
there
was
no
lack
of
opportunity
for
her
to
exercise
it
the
old
friends
were
tremendous
feeders
kunz
was
a
different
man
at
table
he
expanded
like
a
sun
he
would
have
done
well
as
a
sign
for
a
restaurant
schulz
was
no
less
susceptible
to
good
cheer
but
his
ill
health
imposed
more
restraint
upon
him
it
is
true
that
generally
he
did
not
pay
much
heed
to
that
and
he
had
to
pay
for
it
in
that
event
he
did
not
complain
if
he
were
ill
at
least
he
knew
why
like
kunz
he
had
recipes
of
his
own
handed
down
from
father
to
son
for
generations
salome
was
accustomed
therefore
to
work
for
connoisseurs
but
on
this
occasion
she
had
contrived
to
include
all
her
masterpieces
in
one
menu
it
was
like
an
exhibition
of
the
unforgettable
cooking
of
germany
honest
and
unsophisticated
with
all
the
scents
of
all
the
herbs
and
thick
sauces
substantial
soups
perfect
stews
wonderful
carp
sauerkraut
geese
plain
cakes
aniseed
and
caraway
seed
bread
christophe
was
in
raptures
with
his
mouth
full
and
he
ate
like
an
ogre
he
had
the
formidable
capacity
of
his
father
and
grandfather
who
would
have
devoured
a
whole
goose
but
he
could
live
just
as
well
for
a
whole
week
on
bread
and
cheese
and
cram
when
occasion
served
schulz
was
cordial
and
ceremonious
and
watched
him
with
kind
eyes
and
plied
him
with
all
the
wines
of
the
rhine
kunz
was
shining
and
recognized
him
as
a
brother
salome
large
face
was
beaming
happily
at
first
she
had
been
deceived
when
christophe
came
schulz
had
spoken
about
him
so
much
beforehand
that
she
had
fancied
him
as
an
excellency
laden
with
letters
and
honors
when
she
saw
him
she
cried
out
what
is
that
all
but
at
table
christophe
won
her
good
graces
she
had
never
seen
anybody
so
splendidly
do
justice
to
her
talent
instead
of
going
back
to
her
kitchen
she
stayed
by
the
door
to
watch
christophe
who
was
saying
all
sorts
of
absurd
things
without
missing
a
bite
and
with
her
hands
on
her
hips
she
roared
with
laughter
they
were
all
glad
and
happy
there
vas
only
one
shadow
over
their
joy
the
absence
of
pottpetschmidt
they
often
returned
to
it
ah
if
he
were
here
how
he
would
eat
how
he
would
drink
how
he
would
sing
their
praises
of
him
were
inexhaustible
if
only
christophe
could
see
him
but
perhaps
he
would
be
able
to
perhaps
pottpetschmidt
would
return
in
the
evening
on
that
night
at
latest
oh
i
shall
be
gone
said
christophe
a
shadow
passed
over
schulz
beaming
face
what
gone
he
said
in
a
trembling
voice
but
you
are
not
going
oh
yes
said
christophe
gaily
i
must
catch
the
train
schulz
was
in
despair
he
had
counted
on
christophe
spending
the
night
perhaps
several
nights
in
his
house
he
murmured
no
no
you
ca
go
kunz
repeated
and
pottpetschmidt
christophe
looked
at
the
two
of
them
he
was
touched
by
the
dismay
on
their
kind
friendly
faces
and
said
how
good
you
are
if
you
like
i
will
go
morning
schulz
took
him
by
the
hand
ah
he
said
how
glad
i
am
thank
you
thank
you
he
was
like
a
child
to
whom
seems
so
far
so
far
that
it
will
not
bear
thinking
on
christophe
was
not
going
was
theirs
they
would
spend
the
whole
evening
together
he
would
sleep
under
his
roof
that
was
all
that
schulz
saw
he
would
not
look
further
they
became
merry
again
schulz
rose
suddenly
looked
very
solemn
and
excitedly
and
slowly
proposed
the
toast
of
their
guest
who
had
given
him
the
immense
joy
and
honor
of
visiting
the
little
town
and
his
humble
house
he
drank
to
his
happy
return
to
his
success
to
his
glory
to
every
happiness
in
the
world
which
with
all
his
heart
he
wished
him
and
then
he
proposed
another
toast
to
noble
music
another
to
his
old
friend
kunz
another
to
spring
and
he
did
not
forget
pottpetschmidt
kunz
in
his
turn
drank
to
schulz
and
the
others
and
christophe
to
bring
the
toasts
to
an
end
proposed
the
health
of
dame
salome
who
blushed
crimson
upon
that
without
giving
the
orators
time
to
reply
he
began
a
familiar
song
which
the
two
old
men
took
up
after
that
another
and
then
another
for
three
parts
which
was
all
about
friendship
and
music
and
wine
the
whole
was
accompanied
by
loud
laughter
and
the
clink
of
glasses
continually
touching
it
was
three
when
they
got
up
from
the
table
they
were
rather
drowsy
kunz
sank
into
a
chair
he
was
longing
to
have
a
sleep
legs
were
worn
out
by
his
exertions
of
the
morning
and
by
standing
for
his
toasts
they
both
hoped
that
christophe
would
sit
at
the
piano
again
and
go
on
playing
for
hours
but
the
terrible
boy
who
was
in
fine
form
first
struck
two
or
three
chords
on
the
piano
shut
it
abruptly
looked
out
of
the
window
and
asked
if
they
could
not
go
for
a
walk
until
supper
the
country
attracted
him
kunz
showed
little
enthusiasm
but
schulz
at
once
thought
it
an
excellent
idea
and
declared
that
he
must
show
their
guest
the
walk
round
the
kunz
made
a
face
but
he
did
not
protest
and
got
up
with
the
others
he
was
as
desirous
as
schulz
of
showing
christophe
the
beauties
of
the
country
they
went
out
christophe
took
schulz
arm
and
made
him
walk
a
little
faster
than
the
old
man
liked
kunz
followed
mopping
his
brow
they
talked
gaily
the
people
standing
at
their
doors
watched
them
pass
and
thought
that
schulz
looked
like
a
young
man
when
they
left
the
town
they
took
to
the
fields
kunz
complained
of
the
heat
christophe
was
merciless
and
declared
that
the
air
was
exquisite
fortunately
for
the
two
old
men
they
stopped
frequently
to
argue
and
they
forgot
the
length
of
the
walk
in
their
conversation
they
went
into
the
woods
schulz
recited
verses
of
goethe
and
mörike
christophe
loved
poetry
but
he
could
not
remember
any
and
while
he
listened
he
stepped
into
a
vague
dream
in
which
music
replaced
the
words
and
made
him
forget
them
he
admired
schulz
memory
what
a
difference
there
was
between
the
vivacity
of
mind
of
this
poor
rich
old
man
almost
impotent
shut
up
in
his
room
for
a
great
part
of
the
year
shut
up
in
his
little
provincial
town
almost
all
his
life
and
hassler
young
famous
in
the
very
thick
of
the
artistic
movement
and
touring
over
all
europe
for
his
concerts
and
yet
interested
in
nothing
and
unwilling
to
know
anything
not
only
was
schulz
in
touch
with
every
manifestation
of
the
art
of
the
day
that
christophe
knew
but
he
knew
an
immense
amount
about
musicians
of
the
past
and
of
other
countries
of
whom
christophe
had
never
heard
his
memory
was
a
great
reservoir
in
which
all
the
beautiful
waters
of
the
heavens
were
collected
christophe
never
wearied
of
dipping
into
it
and
schulz
was
glad
of
christophe
interest
he
had
sometime
found
willing
listeners
or
docile
pupils
but
he
had
never
yet
found
a
young
and
ardent
heart
with
which
he
could
share
his
enthusiasms
which
sometimes
so
swelled
in
him
that
he
was
like
to
choke
they
had
become
the
best
friends
in
the
world
when
unhappily
the
old
man
chanced
to
express
his
admiration
for
brahms
christophe
was
at
once
coldly
angry
he
dropped
schulz
arm
and
said
harshly
that
anyone
who
loved
brahms
could
not
be
his
friend
that
threw
cold
water
on
their
happiness
schulz
was
too
timid
to
argue
too
honest
to
lie
and
murmured
and
tried
to
explain
but
christophe
stopped
him
enough
it
was
so
cutting
that
it
was
impossible
to
reply
there
was
an
icy
silence
they
walked
on
the
two
old
men
dared
not
look
at
each
other
kunz
coughed
and
tried
to
take
up
the
conversation
again
and
to
talk
of
the
woods
and
the
weather
but
christophe
sulked
and
would
not
talk
and
only
answered
with
monosyllables
kunz
finding
no
response
from
him
tried
to
break
the
silence
by
talking
to
schulz
but
schulz
throat
was
dry
he
could
not
speak
christophe
watched
him
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eyes
and
he
wanted
to
laugh
he
had
forgiven
him
already
he
had
never
been
seriously
angry
with
him
he
even
thought
it
brutal
to
make
the
poor
old
man
sad
but
he
abused
his
power
and
would
not
appear
to
go
back
on
what
he
had
said
they
remained
so
until
they
left
the
woods
nothing
was
to
be
heard
but
the
weary
steps
of
the
two
downcast
old
men
christophe
whistled
through
his
teeth
and
pretended
not
to
see
them
suddenly
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
he
burst
out
laughing
turned
towards
schulz
and
gripped
his
arm
my
dear
good
old
schulz
he
said
looking
at
him
affectionately
it
beautiful
is
it
beautiful
he
was
speaking
of
the
country
and
the
fine
day
but
his
laughing
eyes
seemed
to
say
you
are
good
i
am
a
brute
forgive
me
i
love
you
much
the
old
man
heart
melted
it
was
as
though
the
sun
had
shone
again
after
an
eclipse
but
a
short
time
passed
before
he
could
utter
a
word
christophe
took
his
arm
and
went
on
talking
to
him
more
amiably
than
ever
in
his
eagerness
he
went
faster
and
faster
without
noticing
the
strain
upon
his
two
companions
schulz
did
not
complain
he
did
not
even
notice
his
fatigue
he
was
so
happy
he
knew
that
he
would
have
to
pay
for
that
rashness
but
he
thought
so
much
the
worse
for
when
is
gone
i
shall
have
plenty
of
time
to
rest
but
kunz
who
was
not
so
excited
followed
fifteen
yards
behind
and
looked
a
pitiful
object
christophe
noticed
it
at
last
he
begged
his
pardon
confusedly
and
proposed
that
they
should
lie
down
in
a
meadow
in
the
shade
of
the
poplars
of
course
schulz
acquiesced
without
a
thought
for
the
effect
it
might
have
on
his
bronchitis
fortunately
kunz
thought
of
it
for
him
or
at
least
he
made
it
an
excuse
for
not
running
any
risk
from
the
moisture
of
the
grass
when
he
was
in
such
a
perspiration
he
suggested
that
they
should
take
the
train
back
to
the
town
from
a
station
close
by
they
did
so
in
spite
of
their
fatigue
they
had
to
hurry
so
as
not
to
be
late
and
they
reached
the
station
just
as
the
train
came
in
at
the
sight
of
them
a
big
man
threw
himself
out
of
the
door
of
a
carriage
and
roared
the
names
of
schulz
and
kunz
together
with
all
their
titles
and
qualities
and
he
waved
his
arms
like
a
madman
schulz
and
kunz
shouted
in
reply
and
also
waved
their
arms
they
rushed
to
the
big
man
compartment
and
he
ran
to
meet
them
jostling
the
people
on
the
platform
christophe
was
amazed
and
ran
after
them
asking
what
is
it
and
the
others
shouted
exultantly
it
is
pottpetschmidt
the
name
did
not
convey
much
to
him
he
had
forgotten
the
toasts
at
dinner
pottpetschmidt
in
the
carriage
and
schulz
and
kunz
on
the
step
were
making
a
deafening
noise
they
were
marveling
at
their
encounter
they
climbed
into
the
train
as
it
was
going
schulz
introduced
christophe
pottpetschmidt
bowed
as
stiff
as
a
poker
and
his
features
lost
all
expression
then
when
the
formalities
were
over
he
caught
hold
of
christophe
hand
and
shook
it
five
or
six
times
as
though
he
were
trying
to
pull
his
arm
out
and
then
began
to
shout
again
christophe
was
able
to
make
out
that
he
thanked
god
and
his
stars
for
the
extraordinary
meeting
that
did
not
keep
him
from
slapping
his
thigh
a
moment
later
and
crying
out
upon
the
misfortune
of
having
had
to
go
away
he
who
never
went
away
just
when
the
was
coming
schulz
telegram
had
only
reached
him
that
morning
an
hour
after
the
train
went
he
was
asleep
when
it
arrived
and
they
had
not
thought
it
worth
while
to
wake
him
he
had
stormed
at
the
hotel
people
all
morning
he
was
still
storming
he
had
sent
his
patients
away
cut
his
business
appointments
and
taken
the
first
train
in
his
haste
to
return
but
the
infernal
train
had
missed
the
connection
on
the
main
line
pottpetschmidt
had
had
to
wait
three
hours
at
a
station
he
had
exhausted
all
the
expletives
in
his
vocabulary
and
fully
twenty
times
had
narrated
his
misadventures
to
other
travelers
who
were
also
waiting
and
a
porter
at
the
station
at
last
he
had
started
again
he
was
fearful
of
arriving
too
late
but
thank
god
thank
god
he
took
christophe
hands
again
and
crushed
them
in
his
vast
paws
with
their
hairy
fingers
he
was
fabulously
stout
and
tall
in
proportion
he
had
a
square
head
close
cut
red
hair
a
face
big
eyes
large
nose
thin
lips
a
double
chin
a
short
neck
a
monstrously
wide
back
a
stomach
like
a
barrel
arms
thrust
out
by
his
body
enormous
feet
and
hands
a
gigantic
mass
of
flesh
deformed
by
excess
in
eating
and
drinking
one
of
those
human
that
one
sees
sometimes
rolling
along
the
streets
in
the
towns
of
bavaria
which
keep
the
secret
of
that
race
of
men
that
is
produced
by
a
system
of
gorging
similar
to
that
of
the
strasburg
geese
he
listened
with
joy
and
warmth
like
a
pot
of
butter
and
with
his
two
hands
on
his
outstretched
knees
or
on
those
of
his
neighbors
he
never
stopped
talking
hurling
consonants
into
the
air
like
a
catapult
and
making
them
roll
along
occasionally
he
would
have
a
fit
of
laughing
which
made
him
shake
all
over
he
would
throw
back
his
head
open
his
mouth
snorting
gurgling
choking
his
laughter
would
infect
schulz
and
kunz
and
when
it
was
over
they
would
look
at
christophe
as
they
dried
their
eyes
they
seemed
to
be
asking
him
hein
and
what
do
you
say
christophe
said
nothing
he
thought
fearfully
and
this
monster
sings
my
music
they
went
home
with
schulz
christophe
hoped
to
avoid
singing
and
made
no
advances
in
spite
of
pottpetschmidt
hints
he
was
itching
to
be
heard
but
schulz
and
kunz
were
too
intent
oh
showing
their
friend
off
christophe
had
to
submit
he
sat
at
the
piano
rather
ungraciously
he
thought
my
good
man
my
good
man
you
do
know
what
is
in
store
for
you
have
a
care
i
will
spare
you
nothing
he
thought
that
he
would
hurt
schulz
and
he
was
angry
at
that
but
he
was
none
the
less
determined
to
hurt
him
rather
than
have
this
falstaff
murdering
his
music
he
was
spared
the
pain
of
hurting
his
old
friend
the
fat
man
had
an
admirable
voice
at
the
first
bars
christophe
gave
a
start
of
surprise
schulz
who
never
took
his
eyes
off
him
trembled
he
thought
that
christophe
was
dissatisfied
and
he
was
only
reassured
when
he
saw
his
face
grow
brighter
and
brighter
as
he
went
on
playing
he
was
lit
up
by
the
reflection
of
christophe
delight
and
when
the
song
was
finished
and
christophe
turned
round
and
declared
that
he
had
never
heard
any
of
his
songs
sung
so
well
schulz
found
a
joy
in
all
sweeter
and
greater
than
christophe
in
his
satisfaction
sweeter
and
greater
than
in
his
triumph
for
they
had
only
their
own
pleasure
and
schulz
had
that
of
his
two
friends
they
went
on
with
the
music
christophe
cried
aloud
he
could
not
understand
how
so
ponderous
and
common
a
creature
could
succeed
in
reading
the
idea
of
his
no
doubt
there
were
not
exactly
all
the
shades
of
meaning
but
there
was
the
impulse
and
the
passion
which
he
had
never
quite
succeeded
in
imparting
to
professional
singers
he
looked
at
pottpetschmidt
and
wondered
does
he
really
feel
that
but
he
could
not
see
in
his
eyes
any
other
light
than
that
of
satisfied
vanity
some
unconscious
force
stirred
in
that
solid
flesh
the
blind
passion
was
like
an
army
fighting
without
knowing
against
whom
or
why
the
spirit
of
the
took
possession
of
it
and
it
obeyed
gladly
for
it
had
need
of
action
and
left
to
itself
it
never
would
have
known
how
christophe
fancied
that
on
the
day
of
the
creation
the
great
sculptor
did
not
take
very
much
trouble
to
put
in
order
the
scattered
members
of
his
creatures
and
that
he
had
adjusted
them
anyhow
without
bothering
to
find
out
whether
they
were
suited
to
each
other
and
so
every
one
was
made
up
of
all
sorts
of
pieces
and
one
man
was
scattered
among
five
or
six
different
men
his
brain
was
with
one
his
heart
with
another
and
the
body
belonging
to
his
soul
with
yet
another
the
instrument
was
on
one
side
the
performer
on
the
other
certain
creatures
remained
like
wonderful
violins
forever
shut
up
in
their
cases
for
want
of
anyone
with
the
art
to
play
them
and
those
who
were
fit
to
play
them
were
found
all
their
lives
to
put
up
with
wretched
scraping
fiddles
he
had
all
the
more
reason
for
thinking
so
as
he
was
furious
with
himself
for
never
having
been
able
properly
to
sing
a
page
of
music
he
had
an
untuned
voice
and
could
never
hear
himself
without
disgust
however
intoxicated
by
his
success
pottpetschmidt
began
to
put
expression
into
christophe
that
is
to
say
he
substituted
his
own
for
christophe
naturally
he
did
not
think
that
the
music
gained
by
the
change
and
he
grew
gloomy
schulz
saw
it
his
lack
of
the
critical
faculty
and
his
admiration
for
his
friends
would
not
have
allowed
him
of
his
own
accord
to
set
it
down
to
pottpetschmidt
bad
taste
but
his
affection
for
christophe
made
him
perceptive
of
the
young
man
finest
shades
of
thought
he
was
no
longer
in
himself
he
was
in
christophe
and
he
too
suffered
from
pottpetschmidt
affectations
he
tried
hard
to
stop
his
going
down
that
perilous
slope
it
was
not
easy
to
silence
pottpetschmidt
schulz
found
it
enormously
difficult
when
the
singer
had
exhausted
christophe
repertory
to
keep
him
from
breaking
out
into
the
lucubrations
of
mediocre
compositions
at
the
mention
of
whose
names
christophe
curled
up
and
bristled
like
a
porcupine
fortunately
the
announcement
of
supper
muzzled
pottpetschmidt
another
field
for
his
valor
was
opened
for
him
he
had
no
rival
there
and
christophe
who
was
a
little
weary
with
his
exploits
in
the
afternoon
made
no
attempt
to
vie
with
him
it
was
getting
late
they
sat
round
the
table
and
the
three
friends
watched
christophe
they
drank
in
his
words
it
seemed
very
strange
to
christophe
to
find
himself
in
the
remote
little
town
among
these
old
men
whom
he
had
never
seen
until
that
day
and
to
be
more
intimate
with
them
than
if
they
had
been
his
relations
he
thought
how
fine
it
would
be
for
an
artist
if
he
could
know
of
the
unknown
friends
whom
his
ideas
find
in
the
world
how
gladdened
his
heart
would
be
and
how
fortified
he
would
be
in
his
strength
but
he
is
rarely
that
every
one
lives
and
dies
alone
fearing
to
say
what
he
feels
the
more
he
feels
and
the
more
he
needs
to
express
it
vulgar
flatterers
have
no
difficulty
in
speaking
those
who
love
most
have
to
force
their
lips
open
to
say
that
they
love
and
so
he
must
be
grateful
indeed
to
those
who
dare
to
speak
they
are
unconsciously
collaborators
with
the
christophe
was
filled
with
gratitude
for
old
schulz
he
did
not
confound
him
with
his
two
friends
he
felt
that
he
was
the
soul
of
the
little
group
the
others
were
only
reflections
of
that
living
fire
of
goodness
and
love
the
friendship
that
kunz
and
pottpetschmidt
had
for
him
was
very
different
kunz
was
selfish
music
gave
him
a
comfortable
satisfaction
like
a
fat
cat
when
it
is
stroked
pottpetschmidt
found
in
it
the
pleasure
of
tickled
vanity
and
physical
exercise
neither
of
them
troubled
to
understand
him
but
schulz
absolutely
forgot
himself
he
loved
it
was
late
the
two
friends
went
away
in
the
night
christophe
was
left
alone
with
schulz
he
said
now
i
will
play
for
you
alone
he
sat
at
the
piano
and
played
as
he
knew
how
to
play
when
he
had
some
one
dear
to
him
by
his
side
he
played
his
latest
compositions
the
old
man
was
in
ecstasies
he
sat
near
christophe
and
never
took
his
eyes
from
him
and
held
his
breath
in
the
goodness
of
his
heart
he
was
incapable
of
keeping
the
smallest
happiness
to
himself
and
in
spite
of
himself
he
said
ah
what
a
pity
kunz
is
not
here
that
irritated
christophe
a
little
an
hour
passed
christophe
was
still
playing
they
had
not
exchanged
a
word
when
christophe
had
finished
neither
spoke
a
word
there
was
silence
the
house
the
street
was
asleep
christophe
turned
and
saw
that
the
old
man
was
weeping
he
got
up
and
went
and
embraced
him
they
talked
in
whispers
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
the
clock
ticked
dully
in
the
next
room
schulz
talked
in
a
whisper
with
his
hands
clasped
and
leaning
forward
he
was
telling
christophe
in
answer
to
his
questions
about
his
life
and
his
sorrow
at
every
turn
he
was
ashamed
of
complaining
and
had
to
say
i
am
wrong
i
have
no
right
to
complain
everybody
has
been
very
good
to
me
and
indeed
he
was
not
complaining
it
was
only
an
involuntary
melancholy
emanating
from
the
dull
story
of
his
lonely
life
at
the
most
sorrowful
moments
he
wove
into
it
professions
of
faith
vaguely
idealistic
and
very
sentimental
which
amazed
christophe
though
it
would
have
been
too
cruel
to
contradict
him
at
bottom
there
was
in
schulz
not
so
much
a
firm
belief
as
a
passionate
desire
to
believe
an
uncertain
hope
to
which
he
clung
as
to
a
buoy
he
sought
the
confirmation
of
it
in
christophe
eyes
christophe
understood
the
appeal
in
the
eyes
of
his
friend
who
clung
to
him
with
touching
confidence
imploring
him
and
dictating
his
answer
then
he
spoke
of
the
calm
faith
or
strength
sure
of
itself
words
which
the
old
man
was
expecting
and
they
comforted
him
the
old
man
and
the
young
had
forgotten
the
years
that
lay
between
them
they
were
near
each
other
like
brothers
of
the
same
age
loving
and
helping
each
other
the
weaker
sought
the
support
of
the
stronger
the
old
man
took
refuge
in
the
young
soul
they
parted
after
midnight
christophe
had
to
get
up
early
to
catch
the
train
by
which
he
had
come
and
so
he
did
not
loiter
as
he
undressed
the
old
man
had
prepared
his
guests
room
as
though
for
a
visit
of
several
months
he
had
put
a
bowl
of
roses
on
the
table
and
a
branch
of
laurel
he
had
put
fresh
blotting
paper
on
the
bureau
during
the
morning
he
had
had
an
upright
piano
carried
up
on
the
shelf
by
the
bed
he
had
placed
books
chosen
from
among
his
most
precious
and
beloved
there
was
no
detail
that
he
had
not
lovingly
thought
out
but
it
was
a
waste
of
trouble
christophe
saw
nothing
he
flung
himself
on
his
bed
and
went
sound
asleep
at
once
schulz
could
not
sleep
he
was
pondering
the
joy
that
he
had
had
and
the
sorrow
he
must
have
at
the
departure
of
his
friend
he
was
turning
over
in
his
mind
the
words
that
had
been
spoken
he
was
thinking
that
his
dear
christophe
was
sleeping
near
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
against
which
his
bed
lay
he
was
worn
out
stiff
all
over
depressed
he
felt
that
he
had
caught
cold
during
the
walk
and
that
he
was
going
to
have
a
relapse
but
he
had
only
one
thought
if
only
i
can
hold
out
until
he
has
gone
and
he
was
fearful
of
having
a
fit
of
coughing
and
waking
christophe
he
was
full
of
gratitude
to
god
and
began
to
compose
verses
to
the
song
of
old
simeon
dimittis
he
got
up
in
a
sweat
to
write
the
verses
down
and
sat
at
his
desk
until
he
had
carefully
copied
them
out
with
an
affectionate
dedication
and
his
signature
and
the
date
and
hour
then
he
lay
down
again
with
a
shiver
and
could
not
get
warm
all
night
dawn
came
schulz
thought
regretfully
of
the
dawn
of
the
day
before
but
he
was
angry
with
himself
for
spoiling
with
such
thoughts
the
few
minutes
of
happiness
left
to
him
he
knew
that
on
the
morrow
he
would
regret
the
time
fleeting
then
and
he
tried
not
to
waste
any
of
it
he
listened
eager
for
the
least
sound
in
the
next
room
but
christophe
did
not
stir
he
lay
still
just
as
he
had
gone
to
bed
he
had
not
moved
six
rang
and
he
still
slept
nothing
would
have
been
easier
than
to
make
him
miss
the
train
and
doubtless
he
would
have
taken
it
with
a
laugh
but
the
old
man
was
too
scrupulous
to
use
a
friend
so
without
his
consent
in
vain
did
he
say
to
himself
it
will
not
be
my
fault
i
could
not
help
it
it
will
be
enough
to
say
nothing
and
if
he
does
not
wake
in
time
i
shall
have
another
whole
day
with
him
he
answered
himself
no
i
have
no
right
and
he
thought
it
his
duty
to
go
and
wake
him
he
knocked
at
his
door
christophe
did
not
hear
at
first
he
had
to
knock
again
that
made
the
old
man
heart
thump
as
he
thought
ah
how
well
he
sleeps
he
would
stay
like
that
till
at
last
christophe
replied
gaily
through
the
partition
when
he
learned
the
time
he
cried
out
he
was
heard
bustling
about
his
room
noisily
dressing
himself
singing
scraps
of
melody
while
he
chattered
with
schulz
through
the
wall
and
cracked
jokes
while
the
old
man
laughed
in
spite
of
his
sorrow
the
door
opened
christophe
appeared
fresh
rested
and
happy
he
had
no
thought
of
the
pain
he
was
causing
in
reality
there
was
no
hurry
for
him
to
go
it
would
have
cost
him
nothing
to
stay
a
few
days
longer
and
it
would
have
given
schulz
so
much
pleasure
but
christophe
could
not
know
that
besides
although
he
was
very
fond
of
the
old
man
he
was
glad
to
go
he
was
worn
out
by
the
day
of
perpetual
conversation
by
these
people
who
clung
to
him
in
desperate
fondness
and
then
he
was
young
he
thought
there
would
be
plenty
of
time
to
meet
again
he
was
not
going
to
the
other
ends
of
the
earth
the
old
man
knew
that
he
would
soon
be
much
farther
than
the
other
ends
of
the
earth
and
he
looked
at
christophe
for
all
eternity
in
spite
of
hit
extreme
weariness
he
took
him
to
the
station
a
fine
cold
rain
was
falling
noiselessly
at
the
station
when
he
opened
his
purse
christophe
found
that
he
had
not
enough
money
to
buy
his
ticket
home
he
knew
that
schulz
would
gladly
lead
him
the
money
but
he
would
not
ask
him
for
it
why
why
deny
those
who
love
you
the
opportunity
the
happiness
of
doing
you
a
service
he
would
not
out
of
discretion
perhaps
out
of
vanity
he
took
a
ticket
for
a
station
on
the
way
saying
that
he
would
do
the
rest
of
the
journey
on
foot
the
time
for
leaving
came
they
embraced
on
the
footboard
of
the
carriage
schulz
slipped
the
poem
he
had
written
during
the
night
into
hand
he
stayed
on
the
platform
below
the
compartment
they
had
nothing
more
to
say
to
each
other
as
usual
when
are
too
long
drawn
out
but
schulz
eyes
went
on
speaking
they
never
left
christophe
face
until
the
train
went
the
carriage
disappeared
round
a
curve
schulz
was
left
alone
he
went
back
by
the
muddy
path
he
dragged
along
suddenly
he
felt
all
his
weariness
the
cold
the
melancholy
of
the
rainy
day
he
was
hardly
able
to
reach
home
and
to
go
upstairs
again
hardly
had
he
reached
his
room
than
he
was
seized
with
an
attack
of
asthma
and
coughing
salome
came
to
his
aid
through
his
involuntary
groans
he
said
what
luck
what
luck
that
i
was
prepared
for
it
he
felt
very
ill
he
went
to
bed
salome
fetched
the
doctor
in
bed
he
became
as
limp
as
a
rag
he
could
not
move
only
his
breast
was
heaving
and
panting
like
a
million
billows
his
head
was
heavy
and
feverish
he
spent
the
whole
day
in
living
through
the
day
before
minute
by
minute
he
tormented
himself
and
then
was
angry
with
himself
for
complaining
after
so
much
happiness
with
his
hands
clasped
and
his
heart
big
with
love
he
thanked
god
christophe
was
soothed
by
his
day
and
restored
to
confidence
in
himself
by
the
affection
that
he
had
left
behind
him
so
he
returned
home
when
he
had
gone
as
far
as
his
ticket
would
take
him
he
got
out
blithely
and
took
to
the
road
on
foot
he
had
sixty
kilometers
to
do
he
was
in
no
hurry
and
dawdled
like
a
it
was
april
the
country
was
not
very
far
on
the
leaves
were
unfolding
like
little
wrinkled
hands
at
the
ends
of
the
hack
branches
the
apple
trees
were
in
flower
and
along
the
hedges
the
frail
eglantine
smiled
above
the
leafless
forest
where
a
soft
greenish
down
was
beginning
to
appear
on
the
summit
of
a
little
hill
like
a
trophy
on
the
end
of
a
lance
there
rose
an
old
romanic
castle
three
black
clouds
sailed
across
the
soft
blue
sky
shadows
chased
over
the
country
in
spring
showers
passed
then
the
bright
sun
shone
forth
again
and
the
birds
sang
christophe
found
that
for
some
time
he
had
been
thinking
of
uncle
gottfried
he
had
not
thought
of
the
poor
man
for
a
long
time
and
he
wondered
why
the
memory
of
him
should
so
obstinately
obsess
him
now
he
was
haunted
by
it
as
he
walked
along
a
path
along
a
canal
that
reflected
the
poplars
and
the
image
of
his
uncle
was
so
actual
that
as
he
turned
a
great
wall
he
thought
he
saw
him
coming
towards
him
the
sky
grew
dark
a
heavy
downpour
of
rain
and
hail
fell
and
thunder
rumbled
in
the
distance
christophe
was
near
a
village
he
could
see
its
pink
walls
and
red
roofs
among
the
clumps
of
trees
he
hurried
and
took
shelter
under
the
projecting
roof
of
the
nearest
house
the
came
lashing
down
they
rang
out
on
the
tiles
and
fell
down
into
the
street
like
pieces
of
lead
the
ruts
were
overflowing
above
the
blossoming
orchards
a
rainbow
flung
its
brilliant
garish
scarf
over
the
dark
blue
clouds
on
the
threshold
a
girl
was
standing
knitting
she
asked
christophe
to
enter
he
accepted
the
invitation
the
room
into
which
he
stepped
was
used
as
a
kitchen
a
and
a
at
the
back
a
hung
over
a
great
fire
a
peasant
woman
who
was
cleaning
vegetables
wished
christophe
and
bade
him
go
near
the
fire
to
dry
himself
the
girl
fetched
a
bottle
of
wine
and
gave
him
to
drink
she
sat
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
and
went
on
knitting
while
at
the
same
time
she
looked
after
two
children
who
were
playing
at
testing
each
other
eyes
with
those
grasses
which
are
known
in
the
country
as
thiefs
or
sweeps
she
began
to
talk
to
christophe
it
was
only
after
a
moment
that
he
saw
that
she
was
blind
she
was
not
pretty
she
was
a
big
girl
with
red
cheeks
white
teeth
and
strong
arms
but
her
features
were
irregular
she
had
the
smiling
rather
expressionless
air
of
many
blind
people
and
also
their
mania
for
talking
of
things
and
people
as
though
they
could
see
them
at
first
christophe
was
startled
and
wondered
if
she
were
making
fun
of
him
when
she
said
that
he
looked
well
and
that
the
country
was
looking
very
pretty
but
after
looking
from
the
blind
girl
to
the
woman
who
was
cleaning
the
vegetables
he
saw
that
nobody
was
surprised
and
that
it
was
no
joke
there
was
nothing
to
joke
about
indeed
the
two
women
asked
christophe
friendly
questions
as
to
whither
he
was
going
and
whence
he
had
come
the
blind
girl
joined
in
the
conversation
with
a
rather
exaggerated
eagerness
she
agreed
with
or
commented
on
christophe
remarks
about
the
road
and
the
fields
naturally
her
observations
were
often
wide
of
the
mark
she
seemed
to
be
trying
to
pretend
that
she
could
see
as
well
as
he
other
members
of
the
family
came
in
a
healthy
peasant
of
thirty
and
his
young
wife
christophe
talked
to
them
all
and
watched
the
clearing
sky
waiting
for
the
moment
to
set
out
again
the
blind
girl
hummed
an
air
while
she
plied
her
knitting
needles
the
air
brought
back
all
sorts
of
old
memories
to
christophe
what
he
said
you
know
that
gottfried
had
taught
her
it
he
hummed
the
following
notes
the
girl
began
to
laugh
she
sang
the
first
half
of
the
phrases
and
he
finished
them
he
had
just
got
up
to
go
and
look
at
the
weather
and
he
was
walking
round
the
room
mechanically
taking
stock
of
every
corner
of
it
when
near
the
dresser
he
saw
an
object
which
made
him
start
it
was
a
long
twisted
stick
the
handle
of
which
was
roughly
carved
to
represent
a
little
bent
man
bowing
christophe
knew
it
well
he
had
played
with
it
as
a
child
he
pounced
on
the
stick
and
asked
in
a
choking
voice
where
did
you
get
this
where
did
you
get
it
the
man
looked
up
and
said
a
friend
left
it
here
an
old
friend
who
is
dead
christophe
cried
gottfried
they
all
turned
and
asked
how
do
you
know
and
when
christophe
told
them
that
gottfried
was
his
uncle
they
were
all
greatly
excited
the
blind
girl
got
up
her
ball
of
wool
rolled
across
the
room
she
stopped
her
work
and
took
christophe
hands
and
said
in
a
great
state
of
emotion
you
are
his
nephew
they
all
talked
at
once
christophe
asked
but
how
how
do
you
come
to
know
him
the
man
replied
it
was
here
that
he
died
they
sat
down
again
and
when
the
excitement
had
gone
down
a
little
the
mother
told
as
she
went
on
with
her
work
that
gottfried
used
to
go
to
the
house
for
many
years
he
always
used
to
stay
there
on
his
way
to
and
fro
from
his
journeys
the
last
time
he
came
it
was
in
last
july
he
seemed
very
tired
and
when
he
took
off
his
pack
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
speak
a
word
but
they
did
not
take
any
notice
of
it
because
they
were
used
to
seeing
him
like
that
when
he
arrived
and
knew
that
he
was
short
of
breath
he
did
not
complain
either
he
never
used
to
complain
he
always
used
to
find
some
happiness
in
the
most
unpleasant
things
when
he
was
doing
some
exhausting
work
he
used
to
be
glad
thinking
how
good
it
would
be
in
bed
at
night
and
when
he
was
ill
he
used
to
say
how
good
it
would
be
when
he
was
not
ill
any
longer
and
sir
it
is
wrong
to
be
always
content
added
the
woman
for
if
you
axe
not
sorry
for
yourself
nobody
will
pity
you
i
always
complain
well
nobody
had
paid
any
attention
to
him
they
had
even
chaffed
him
about
looking
so
well
and
modesta
that
was
the
blind
girl
name
who
had
just
relieved
him
of
his
pack
had
asked
him
if
he
was
never
going
to
be
tired
of
running
like
a
young
man
he
smiled
in
reply
for
he
could
not
speak
he
sat
on
the
seat
by
the
door
everybody
went
about
their
work
the
men
to
the
fields
the
woman
to
her
cooking
modesta
went
near
the
seat
she
stood
leaning
against
the
door
with
her
knitting
in
her
hands
and
talked
to
gottfried
he
did
not
reply
she
did
not
ask
him
for
any
reply
and
told
him
everything
that
had
happened
since
his
last
visit
he
breathed
with
difficulty
and
she
heard
him
trying
hard
to
speak
instead
of
being
anxious
about
him
she
said
do
speak
just
rest
you
shall
talk
presently
how
can
people
tire
themselves
out
like
that
and
then
he
did
not
talk
or
even
try
to
talk
she
went
on
with
her
story
thinking
that
he
was
listening
he
sighed
and
said
nothing
when
the
mother
came
a
little
later
she
found
modesta
still
talking
and
gottfried
motionless
on
the
seat
with
his
head
flung
back
facing
the
sky
for
some
minutes
modesta
had
been
talking
to
a
dead
man
she
understood
then
that
the
poor
man
had
been
trying
to
say
a
few
words
before
he
died
but
had
not
been
able
to
then
with
his
sad
smile
he
had
accepted
that
and
had
closed
his
eyes
in
the
peace
of
the
summer
evening
the
rain
had
ceased
the
went
to
the
stables
the
son
took
his
mattock
and
cleared
the
little
gutter
in
front
of
the
door
which
the
mud
had
obstructed
modesta
had
disappeared
at
the
beginning
of
the
story
christophe
was
left
alone
in
the
room
with
the
mother
and
was
silent
and
much
moved
the
old
woman
who
was
rather
talkative
could
not
bear
a
prolonged
silence
and
she
began
to
tell
him
the
whole
history
of
her
acquaintance
with
gottfried
it
went
far
back
when
she
was
quite
young
gottfried
loved
her
he
dared
not
tell
her
but
it
became
a
joke
she
made
fun
of
him
everybody
made
fun
of
him
it
was
the
custom
wherever
he
went
gottfried
used
to
come
faithfully
every
year
it
seemed
natural
to
him
that
people
should
make
fun
of
him
natural
that
she
should
have
married
and
been
happy
with
another
man
she
had
been
too
happy
she
had
boasted
too
much
of
her
happiness
then
unhappiness
came
her
husband
died
suddenly
then
his
daughter
a
fine
strong
girl
whom
everybody
admired
who
was
to
be
married
to
the
son
of
the
richest
farmer
of
the
district
lost
her
sight
as
the
result
of
an
accident
one
day
when
she
had
climbed
to
the
great
pear
tree
behind
the
house
to
pick
the
fruit
the
ladder
slipped
as
she
fell
a
broken
branch
struck
a
blow
near
the
eye
at
first
it
was
thought
that
she
would
escape
with
a
scar
but
later
she
had
had
unceasing
pains
in
her
forehead
one
eye
lost
its
sight
then
the
other
and
all
their
remedies
had
been
useless
of
course
the
marriage
was
broken
off
her
betrothed
had
vanished
without
any
explanation
and
of
all
the
young
men
who
a
month
before
had
actually
fought
for
a
dance
with
her
not
one
had
the
courage
it
is
quite
comprehensible
to
take
a
blind
girl
to
his
arms
and
so
modesta
who
till
then
had
been
careless
and
gay
had
fallen
into
such
despair
that
she
wanted
to
die
she
refused
to
eat
she
did
nothing
but
weep
from
morning
to
evening
and
during
the
night
they
used
to
hear
her
still
moaning
in
her
bed
they
did
not
know
what
to
do
they
could
only
join
her
in
her
despair
and
she
only
wept
the
more
at
last
they
lost
patience
with
her
moaning
then
they
scolded
her
and
she
talked
of
throwing
herself
into
the
canal
the
minister
would
come
sometimes
he
would
talk
of
the
good
god
and
eternal
things
and
the
merit
she
was
gaining
for
the
next
world
by
bearing
her
sorrows
but
that
did
not
console
her
at
all
one
day
gottfried
came
modesta
had
never
been
very
kind
to
him
not
that
she
was
naturally
unkind
but
she
was
disdainful
and
besides
she
never
thought
she
loved
to
laugh
and
there
was
no
malice
in
what
she
said
or
did
to
him
when
he
heard
of
her
misfortune
he
was
as
overwhelmed
by
it
as
though
he
were
a
member
of
the
family
however
he
did
not
let
her
see
it
the
first
time
he
saw
her
he
went
and
sat
by
her
side
made
no
allusion
to
her
accident
and
began
to
talk
quietly
as
he
had
always
done
before
he
had
no
word
of
pity
for
her
he
even
seemed
not
to
notice
that
she
was
blind
only
he
never
talked
to
her
of
things
she
could
not
see
he
talked
to
her
about
what
she
could
hear
or
notice
in
her
blindness
and
he
did
it
quite
simply
as
though
it
were
a
natural
thing
it
was
as
though
he
too
were
blind
at
first
she
did
not
listen
and
went
on
weeping
but
next
day
she
listened
better
and
even
talked
to
him
a
little
and
the
woman
went
on
i
do
not
know
what
he
can
have
said
to
her
for
we
were
and
i
was
too
busy
to
notice
her
but
in
the
evening
when
we
came
in
from
the
fields
we
found
her
talking
quietly
and
after
that
she
went
on
getting
better
she
seemed
to
forget
her
affliction
but
every
now
and
then
she
would
think
of
it
again
she
would
weep
alone
or
try
to
talk
to
gottfried
of
sad
things
but
he
seemed
not
to
hear
or
he
would
not
reply
in
the
same
tone
he
would
go
on
talking
gravely
or
merrily
of
things
which
soothed
and
interested
her
at
last
he
persuaded
her
to
go
out
of
the
house
which
she
had
never
left
since
her
accident
he
made
her
go
a
few
yards
round
the
garden
at
first
and
then
for
a
longer
distance
in
the
fields
and
at
last
she
learned
to
find
her
way
everywhere
and
to
make
out
everything
as
though
she
could
see
she
even
notices
things
to
which
we
never
pay
any
attention
and
she
is
interested
in
everything
whereas
before
she
was
never
interested
in
much
outside
herself
that
time
gottfried
stayed
with
us
longer
than
usual
we
dared
not
ask
him
to
postpone
his
departure
but
he
stayed
of
his
own
accord
until
he
saw
that
she
was
calmer
and
one
day
she
was
out
there
in
the
yard
i
heard
her
laughing
i
can
not
tell
you
what
an
effect
that
had
on
me
gottfried
looked
happy
too
he
was
sitting
near
me
we
looked
at
each
other
and
i
am
not
ashamed
to
tell
you
sir
that
i
kissed
him
with
all
my
heart
then
he
said
to
me
i
think
i
can
go
i
am
not
needed
any
more
i
tried
to
keep
him
but
he
said
i
must
go
now
i
can
not
stay
any
longer
everybody
knew
that
he
was
like
the
wandering
jew
he
could
not
stay
anywhere
we
did
not
insist
then
he
went
but
he
arranged
to
come
here
more
often
and
every
time
it
was
a
great
joy
for
modesta
she
was
always
better
after
his
visits
she
began
to
work
in
the
house
again
her
brother
married
she
looks
after
the
children
and
now
she
never
complains
and
always
looks
happy
i
sometimes
wonder
if
she
would
be
so
happy
if
she
had
her
two
eyes
yes
indeed
sir
there
are
days
when
i
think
that
it
would
be
better
to
be
like
her
and
not
to
see
certain
ugly
people
and
certain
evil
things
the
world
is
growing
very
ugly
it
grows
worse
every
day
and
yet
i
should
be
very
much
afraid
of
god
taking
me
at
my
word
and
for
my
part
i
would
rather
go
on
seeing
the
world
ugly
as
it
is
modesta
came
back
and
the
conversation
changed
christophe
wished
to
go
now
that
the
weather
was
fair
again
but
they
would
not
let
him
he
had
to
agree
to
stay
to
supper
and
to
spend
the
night
with
them
modesta
sat
near
christophe
and
did
not
leave
him
all
the
evening
he
would
have
liked
to
talk
intimately
to
the
girl
whose
lot
filled
him
with
pity
but
she
gave
him
no
opportunity
she
would
only
try
to
ask
him
about
gottfried
when
christophe
told
her
certain
things
she
did
not
know
she
was
happy
and
a
little
jealous
she
was
a
little
unwilling
to
talk
of
gottfried
herself
it
was
apparent
that
she
did
not
tell
everything
and
when
she
did
tell
everything
she
was
sorry
for
it
at
once
her
memories
were
her
property
she
did
not
like
sharing
them
with
another
in
her
affection
she
was
as
eager
as
a
peasant
woman
in
her
attachment
to
her
land
it
hurt
her
to
think
that
anybody
could
love
gottfried
as
much
as
she
it
is
true
that
she
refused
to
believe
it
and
christophe
understanding
left
her
that
satisfaction
as
he
listened
to
her
he
saw
that
although
she
had
seen
gottfried
and
had
even
seen
him
with
indulgent
eyes
since
her
blindness
she
had
made
of
him
an
image
absolutely
different
from
the
reality
and
she
had
transferred
to
the
phantom
of
her
mind
all
the
hunger
for
love
that
was
in
her
nothing
had
disturbed
her
illusion
with
the
bold
certainty
of
the
blind
who
calmly
invent
what
they
do
not
know
she
said
to
christophe
you
are
like
him
he
understood
that
for
years
she
had
grown
used
to
living
in
a
house
with
closed
shutters
through
which
the
truth
could
not
enter
and
now
that
she
had
learned
to
see
in
the
darkness
that
surrounded
her
and
even
to
forget
the
darkness
perhaps
she
would
have
been
afraid
of
a
ray
of
light
filtering
through
the
gloom
with
christophe
she
recalled
a
number
of
rather
silly
trivialities
in
a
smiling
and
disjointed
conversation
in
which
christophe
could
not
be
at
his
ease
he
was
irritated
by
her
chatter
he
could
not
understand
how
a
creature
who
had
suffered
so
much
had
not
become
more
serious
in
her
suffering
and
he
could
not
find
tolerance
for
such
futility
every
now
and
then
he
tried
to
talk
of
graver
things
but
they
found
no
echo
modesta
could
not
or
would
not
follow
him
they
went
to
bed
it
was
long
before
christophe
could
sleep
he
was
thinking
of
gottfried
and
trying
to
disengage
him
from
the
image
of
modesta
childish
memories
he
found
it
difficult
and
was
irritated
his
heart
ached
at
the
thought
that
gottfried
had
died
there
and
that
his
body
had
no
doubt
lain
in
that
very
bed
he
tried
to
live
through
the
agony
of
his
last
moments
when
he
could
neither
speak
nor
make
the
blind
girl
understand
and
had
closed
his
eyes
in
death
he
longed
to
have
been
able
to
raise
his
eyelids
and
to
read
the
thoughts
hidden
under
them
the
mystery
of
that
soul
which
had
gone
without
making
itself
known
perhaps
even
without
knowing
itself
it
never
tried
to
know
itself
and
all
its
wisdom
lay
in
not
desiring
wisdom
or
in
not
trying
to
impose
its
will
on
circumstance
but
in
abandoning
itself
to
the
force
of
circumstance
in
accepting
it
and
loving
it
so
he
assimilated
the
mysterious
essence
of
the
world
without
even
thinking
of
it
and
if
he
had
done
so
much
good
to
the
blind
girl
to
christophe
and
doubtless
to
many
others
who
would
be
forever
unknown
it
was
because
instead
of
bringing
the
customary
words
of
the
revolt
of
man
against
nature
he
brought
something
of
the
indifferent
peace
of
nature
and
reconciled
the
submissive
soul
with
her
he
did
good
like
the
fields
the
woods
all
nature
with
which
he
was
impregnated
christophe
remembered
the
evenings
he
had
spent
with
gottfried
in
the
country
his
walks
as
a
child
the
stories
and
songs
in
the
night
he
remembered
also
the
last
walk
he
had
taken
with
his
uncle
on
the
hill
above
the
town
on
a
cold
winter
morning
and
the
tears
came
to
his
eyes
once
more
he
did
not
try
to
sleep
so
as
to
remain
with
his
memories
he
did
not
wish
to
lose
one
moment
of
that
night
in
the
little
place
filled
with
the
soul
of
gottfried
to
which
he
had
been
led
as
though
impelled
by
some
unknown
force
but
while
he
lay
listening
to
the
irregular
trickling
of
the
fountain
and
the
shrill
cries
of
the
bats
the
healthy
fatigue
of
youth
mastered
his
will
and
he
fell
asleep
when
he
awoke
the
sun
was
shining
everybody
on
the
farm
was
already
at
work
in
the
hall
he
found
only
the
old
woman
and
the
children
the
young
couple
were
in
the
fields
sand
modesta
had
gone
to
milk
they
looked
for
her
in
vain
she
was
nowhere
to
be
found
christophe
said
he
would
not
wait
for
her
return
he
did
not
much
want
to
see
her
and
he
said
that
he
was
in
a
hurry
he
set
out
after
telling
the
old
woman
to
bid
the
others
for
him
as
he
was
leaving
the
village
at
a
turn
of
the
road
he
the
blind
girl
sitting
on
a
bank
under
a
hawthorn
hedge
she
got
up
as
she
heard
him
coming
approached
him
smiling
took
his
hand
and
said
come
they
climbed
up
through
meadows
to
a
little
shady
flowering
field
filled
with
tombstones
which
looked
down
on
the
village
she
led
him
to
a
grave
and
said
he
is
there
they
both
knelt
down
christophe
remembered
another
grave
by
which
he
had
knelt
with
gottfried
and
he
thought
soon
it
will
be
my
turn
but
there
was
no
sadness
in
his
thought
a
great
peace
was
ascending
from
the
earth
christophe
leaned
over
the
grave
and
said
in
a
whisper
to
gottfried
enter
into
me
modesta
was
praying
with
her
hands
clasped
and
her
lips
moving
in
silence
then
she
went
round
the
grave
on
her
knees
feeling
the
ground
and
the
grass
and
the
flowers
with
her
hands
she
seemed
to
caress
them
her
quick
fingers
seemed
to
see
they
gently
plucked
the
dead
stalks
of
the
ivy
and
the
faded
violets
she
laid
her
hand
on
the
curb
to
get
up
christophe
saw
her
fingers
pass
furtively
over
gottfried
name
lightly
touching
each
letter
she
said
the
earth
is
sweet
this
morning
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
he
gave
her
his
she
made
him
touch
the
moist
warm
earth
he
did
not
loose
her
hand
their
locked
fingers
plunged
into
the
earth
he
kissed
modesta
she
kissed
him
too
they
both
rose
to
their
feet
she
held
out
to
him
a
few
fresh
violets
she
had
gathered
and
put
the
faded
ones
into
her
bosom
they
dusted
their
knees
and
left
the
cemetery
without
a
word
in
the
fields
the
larks
were
singing
white
butterflies
danced
about
their
heads
they
sat
down
in
a
meadow
a
few
yards
away
from
each
other
the
smoke
of
the
village
was
ascending
direct
to
the
sky
that
was
washed
by
the
rain
the
still
canal
glimmered
between
the
poplars
a
gleaming
blue
mist
wrapped
the
meadows
and
woods
in
its
folds
modesta
broke
the
silence
she
spoke
in
a
whisper
of
the
beauty
of
the
day
as
though
she
could
see
it
she
drank
in
the
air
through
her
lips
she
listened
for
the
sounds
of
creatures
and
things
christophe
also
knew
the
worth
of
such
music
he
said
what
she
was
thinking
and
could
not
have
said
he
named
certain
of
the
cries
and
imperceptible
tremors
that
they
could
hear
in
the
grass
in
the
depths
of
the
air
she
said
ah
you
see
that
too
he
replied
that
gottfried
had
taught
him
to
distinguish
them
you
too
she
said
a
little
crossly
he
wanted
to
say
to
her
do
not
be
jealous
but
he
saw
the
divine
light
smiling
all
about
them
he
looked
at
her
blind
eyes
and
was
filled
with
pity
so
he
asked
it
was
gottfried
taught
you
she
said
yes
and
that
they
gave
her
more
delight
than
ever
before
she
did
not
say
before
what
she
never
mentioned
the
words
eyes
or
blind
they
were
silent
for
a
moment
christophe
looked
at
her
in
pity
she
felt
that
he
was
looking
at
her
he
would
have
liked
to
tell
her
how
much
he
pitied
her
he
would
have
liked
her
to
complain
to
confide
in
him
he
asked
kindly
you
have
been
very
unhappy
she
sat
dumb
and
unyielding
she
plucked
the
blades
of
grass
and
munched
them
in
silence
after
a
few
moments
the
song
of
a
lark
was
going
farther
and
farther
from
them
in
the
sky
christophe
told
her
how
he
too
had
been
unhappy
and
how
gottfried
had
helped
him
he
told
her
all
his
sorrows
his
trials
as
though
he
were
thinking
aloud
or
talking
to
a
sister
the
blind
girl
face
lit
up
as
he
told
his
story
which
she
followed
eagerly
christophe
watched
her
and
saw
that
she
was
on
the
point
of
speaking
she
made
a
movement
to
come
near
him
and
hold
his
hand
he
moved
too
but
already
she
had
relapsed
into
her
impassiveness
and
when
he
had
finished
she
only
replied
with
a
few
banal
words
behind
her
broad
forehead
on
which
there
was
not
a
line
there
was
the
obstinacy
of
a
peasant
hard
as
a
stone
she
said
that
she
must
go
home
to
look
after
her
brothers
children
she
talked
of
them
with
a
calm
smile
he
asked
her
you
are
happy
she
seemed
to
be
more
happy
to
hear
him
say
the
word
she
said
she
was
happy
and
insisted
on
the
reasons
she
had
for
being
so
she
was
trying
to
persuade
herself
and
him
that
it
was
so
she
spoke
of
the
children
and
the
house
and
all
that
she
had
to
do
oh
yes
she
said
i
am
very
happy
christophe
did
not
reply
she
rose
to
go
he
rose
too
they
said
gaily
and
carelessly
modesta
hand
trembled
a
little
in
christophe
she
said
you
will
have
fine
weather
for
your
walk
and
she
told
him
of
a
crossroads
where
he
must
not
go
wrong
it
was
as
though
of
the
two
christophe
were
the
blind
one
they
parted
he
went
down
the
hill
when
he
reached
the
bottom
he
turned
she
was
standing
at
the
summit
in
the
same
place
she
waved
her
handkerchief
and
made
signs
to
him
as
though
she
saw
him
there
was
something
heroic
and
absurd
in
her
obstinacy
in
denying
her
misfortune
something
which
touched
christophe
and
hurt
him
he
felt
how
worthy
modesta
was
of
pity
and
even
of
admiration
and
he
could
not
have
lived
two
days
with
her
as
he
went
his
way
between
flowering
hedges
he
thought
of
dear
old
schulz
and
his
old
eyes
bright
and
tender
before
which
so
many
sorrows
had
passed
which
they
refused
to
see
for
they
would
not
see
hurtful
realities
how
does
he
see
me
i
wonder
thought
christophe
i
am
so
different
from
his
idea
of
me
to
him
i
am
what
he
wants
me
to
be
everything
is
in
his
own
image
pure
and
noble
like
himself
he
could
not
bear
life
if
he
saw
it
as
it
is
and
he
thought
of
the
girl
living
in
darkness
who
denied
the
darkness
and
tried
to
pretend
that
what
was
was
not
and
that
what
was
not
was
then
he
saw
the
greatness
of
german
idealism
which
he
had
so
often
loathed
because
in
vulgar
souls
it
is
a
source
of
hypocrisy
and
stupidity
he
saw
the
beauty
of
the
faith
which
begets
a
world
within
the
world
different
from
the
world
like
a
little
island
in
the
but
he
could
not
bear
such
a
faith
for
himself
and
refused
to
take
refuge
upon
such
an
island
of
the
dead
life
truth
he
would
not
be
a
lying
hero
perhaps
that
optimistic
lie
which
a
german
emperor
tried
to
make
law
for
all
his
people
was
indeed
necessary
for
weak
creatures
if
they
were
to
live
and
christophe
would
have
thought
it
a
crime
to
snatch
from
such
poor
wretches
the
illusion
which
upheld
them
but
for
himself
he
never
could
have
recourse
to
such
subterfuges
he
would
rather
die
than
live
by
illusion
was
not
art
also
an
illusion
no
it
must
not
be
truth
truth
byes
wide
open
let
him
draw
in
through
every
pore
the
breath
of
life
see
things
as
they
are
squarely
face
his
misfortunes
and
laugh
several
months
passed
christophe
had
lost
all
hope
of
escaping
from
the
town
hassler
the
only
man
who
could
have
saved
him
had
refused
to
help
him
and
old
schulz
friendship
had
been
taken
from
him
almost
as
soon
as
it
had
been
given
he
had
written
once
on
his
return
and
he
had
received
two
affectionate
letters
but
from
sheer
laziness
and
especially
because
of
the
difficulty
he
had
expressing
himself
in
a
letter
he
delayed
thanking
him
for
his
kind
words
he
put
off
writing
from
day
to
day
and
when
at
last
he
made
up
his
mind
to
write
he
had
a
word
from
kunz
announcing
the
death
of
his
old
friend
schulz
had
had
a
relapse
of
his
bronchitis
which
had
developed
into
pneumonia
he
had
forbidden
them
to
bother
christophe
of
whom
he
was
always
talking
in
spite
of
his
extreme
weakness
and
many
years
of
illness
he
was
not
spared
a
long
and
painful
end
he
had
charged
kunz
to
convey
the
tidings
to
christophe
and
to
tell
him
that
he
had
thought
of
him
up
to
the
last
hour
that
he
thanked
him
for
all
the
happiness
he
owed
him
and
that
his
blessing
would
be
on
christophe
as
long
as
he
lived
kunz
did
not
tell
him
that
the
day
with
christophe
had
probably
been
the
reason
of
his
relapse
and
the
cause
of
his
death
christophe
wept
in
silence
and
he
felt
them
all
the
worth
of
the
friend
he
had
lost
and
how
much
he
loved
him
and
he
was
grieved
not
to
have
told
him
more
of
how
he
loved
him
it
was
too
late
now
and
what
was
left
to
him
the
good
schulz
had
only
appeared
enough
to
make
the
void
seem
more
empty
the
night
more
black
after
he
ceased
to
be
as
for
kunz
and
pottpetschmidt
they
had
no
value
outside
the
friendship
they
had
for
schulz
and
schulz
for
them
christophe
valued
them
at
their
proper
worth
he
wrote
to
them
once
and
their
relation
ended
there
he
tried
also
to
write
to
modesta
but
she
answered
with
a
commonplace
letter
in
which
she
spoke
only
of
trivialities
he
gave
up
the
correspondence
he
wrote
to
nobody
and
nobody
wrote
to
him
silence
silence
from
day
to
day
the
heavy
cloak
of
silence
descended
upon
christophe
it
was
like
a
rain
of
ashes
falling
on
him
it
seemed
already
to
be
evening
and
christophe
was
losing
his
hold
on
life
he
would
not
resign
himself
to
that
the
hour
of
sleep
was
not
yet
come
he
must
live
and
he
could
not
live
in
germany
the
sufferings
of
his
genius
cramped
by
the
narrowness
of
the
little
town
lashed
him
into
injustice
his
nerves
were
raw
everything
drew
blood
he
was
like
one
of
those
wretched
wild
animals
who
perished
of
boredom
in
the
holes
and
cages
in
which
they
were
imprisoned
in
the
town
gardens
christophe
used
often
to
go
and
look
at
them
in
sympathy
he
used
to
look
at
their
wonderful
eyes
in
which
there
burned
or
every
day
grew
fainter
a
fierce
and
desperate
fire
ah
how
they
would
have
loved
the
brutal
bullet
which
sets
free
or
the
knife
that
strikes
into
their
bleeding
hearts
anything
rather
than
the
savage
indifference
of
those
men
who
prevented
them
from
either
living
or
dying
not
the
hostility
of
the
people
was
the
hardest
for
christophe
to
bear
but
their
inconsistency
their
formless
shallow
natures
there
was
no
knowing
how
to
take
them
the
opposition
of
one
of
those
bard
races
who
refuse
to
understand
any
new
thought
were
much
better
against
force
it
is
possible
to
oppose
force
the
pick
and
the
mine
which
hew
away
and
blow
up
the
hard
rock
but
what
can
be
done
against
an
amorphous
mass
which
gives
like
a
jelly
collapses
under
the
least
pressure
and
retains
no
imprint
of
it
all
thought
and
energy
and
everything
disappeared
in
the
slough
when
a
stone
fell
there
were
hardly
more
than
a
few
ripples
quivering
on
the
surface
of
the
gulf
the
monster
opened
and
shut
its
maw
and
there
was
left
no
trace
of
what
had
been
they
were
not
enemies
dear
god
if
they
only
had
been
enemies
they
were
people
who
had
not
the
strength
to
love
or
hate
or
believe
or
disbelieve
in
religion
in
art
in
politics
in
daily
life
and
all
their
energies
were
expended
in
trying
to
reconcile
the
irreconcilable
especially
since
the
german
victories
they
had
been
striving
to
make
a
compromise
a
revolting
intrigue
between
their
new
power
and
their
old
principles
the
old
idealism
had
not
been
renounced
there
should
have
been
a
new
effort
of
freedom
of
which
they
were
incapable
they
were
content
with
a
forgery
with
making
it
subservient
to
german
interests
like
the
serene
and
subtle
schwabian
hegel
who
had
waited
until
after
leipzig
and
waterloo
to
assimilate
the
cause
of
his
philosophy
with
the
prussian
state
their
interests
having
changed
their
principles
had
changed
too
when
they
were
defeated
they
said
that
germany
ideal
was
humanity
now
that
they
had
defeated
others
they
said
that
germany
was
the
ideal
of
humanity
when
other
countries
were
more
powerful
they
said
with
lessing
that
is
a
heroic
weakness
which
it
is
well
to
be
and
they
called
themselves
of
the
now
that
they
were
in
the
ascendant
they
could
not
enough
despise
the
utopias
la
universal
peace
fraternity
pacific
progress
the
rights
of
man
natural
equality
they
said
that
the
strongest
people
had
absolute
rights
against
the
others
and
that
the
others
being
weaker
had
no
rights
against
themselves
it
was
the
living
god
and
the
incarnate
idea
the
progress
of
which
is
accomplished
by
war
violence
and
oppression
force
had
become
holy
now
that
it
was
on
their
side
force
had
become
the
only
idealism
and
the
only
intelligence
in
truth
germany
had
suffered
so
much
for
centuries
from
having
idealism
and
no
fame
that
she
had
every
excuse
after
so
many
trials
for
making
the
sorrowful
confession
that
at
all
costs
force
must
be
hers
but
what
bitterness
was
hidden
in
such
a
confession
from
the
people
of
herder
and
goethe
and
what
an
abdication
was
the
german
victory
what
a
degradation
of
the
german
ideal
alas
there
were
only
too
many
facilities
for
such
an
abdication
in
the
deplorable
tendency
even
of
the
best
germans
to
submit
chief
characteristic
of
said
moser
more
than
a
century
ago
and
madame
de
staël
have
submitted
doughtily
they
find
philosophic
reasons
for
explaining
the
least
philosophic
theory
in
the
world
respect
for
power
and
the
chastening
emotion
of
fear
which
changes
that
respect
into
christophe
found
that
feeling
everywhere
in
germany
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
from
the
william
tell
of
schiller
that
limited
little
bourgeois
with
muscles
like
a
porter
who
as
the
free
jew
börne
says
reconcile
honor
and
fear
passes
before
the
pillar
of
dear
herr
gessler
with
his
eyes
down
so
as
to
be
able
to
say
that
he
did
not
see
the
hat
did
not
to
the
aged
and
respectable
professor
weisse
a
man
of
seventy
and
one
of
the
most
honored
mea
of
learning
in
the
town
who
when
he
saw
a
coming
would
make
haste
to
give
him
the
path
and
would
step
down
into
the
road
christophe
blood
boiled
whenever
he
saw
one
of
these
small
acts
of
daily
servility
they
hurt
him
as
much
as
though
he
had
demeaned
himself
the
arrogant
manners
of
the
officers
whom
he
met
in
the
street
their
haughty
insolence
made
him
speechless
with
anger
he
never
would
make
way
for
them
whenever
he
passed
them
he
returned
their
arrogant
stare
more
than
once
he
was
very
near
causing
a
scene
he
seemed
to
be
looking
for
trouble
however
he
was
the
first
to
understand
the
futility
of
such
bravado
but
he
had
moments
of
aberration
the
perpetual
constraint
which
he
imposed
on
himself
and
the
accumulation
of
force
in
him
that
had
no
outlet
made
him
furious
then
he
was
ready
to
go
any
length
and
he
had
a
feeling
that
if
he
stayed
a
year
longer
in
the
place
he
would
be
lost
he
loathed
the
brutal
militarism
which
he
felt
weighing
down
upon
him
the
sabers
clanking
on
the
pavement
the
piles
of
arms
and
the
guns
placed
outside
the
barracks
their
muzzles
gaping
down
on
the
town
ready
to
fire
scandalous
novels
which
were
then
making
a
great
stir
denounced
the
corruption
of
the
garrisons
great
and
small
the
officers
were
represented
as
mischievous
creatures
who
outside
their
automatic
duties
were
only
idle
and
spent
their
time
in
drinking
gambling
getting
into
debt
living
on
their
families
slandering
one
another
and
from
top
to
bottom
of
the
hierarchy
they
abused
their
authority
at
the
expense
of
their
inferiors
the
idea
that
he
would
one
day
have
to
obey
them
stuck
in
christophe
throat
he
could
not
no
he
could
never
bear
it
and
lose
his
own
by
submitting
to
their
humiliations
and
injustice
he
had
no
idea
of
the
moral
strength
in
some
of
them
or
of
all
that
they
might
be
suffering
themselves
lost
illusions
so
much
strength
and
youth
and
honor
and
faith
and
passionate
desire
for
sacrifice
turned
to
ill
account
and
spoiled
the
pointlessness
of
a
career
which
if
it
is
only
a
career
if
it
has
not
sacrifice
as
its
end
is
only
a
grim
activity
an
inept
display
a
ritual
which
is
recited
without
belief
in
the
words
that
are
said
his
country
was
not
enough
for
christophe
he
felt
in
himself
that
unknown
force
which
wakes
suddenly
irresistibly
in
certain
species
of
birds
at
definite
times
like
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
tides
the
instinct
of
the
great
migrations
as
he
read
the
volumes
of
herder
and
fichte
which
old
schulz
had
left
him
he
found
souls
like
his
own
not
of
the
slavishly
bound
to
the
globe
but
sons
of
the
turning
invincibly
to
the
light
wheresoever
it
comes
whither
should
he
go
he
did
not
know
but
instinctively
his
eyes
turned
to
the
latin
south
and
first
to
france
france
the
eternal
refuge
of
germany
in
distress
how
often
had
german
thought
turned
to
france
without
ceasing
to
slander
her
even
since
seventy
what
an
attraction
emanated
from
the
town
which
had
been
shattered
and
smoking
under
the
german
guns
the
most
revolutionary
and
the
most
reactionary
forms
of
thought
and
art
had
found
alternately
and
sometimes
at
once
example
and
inspiration
there
like
so
many
other
great
german
musicians
in
distress
christophe
turned
towards
paris
what
did
he
know
of
the
french
two
women
faces
and
some
chance
reading
that
was
enough
for
him
to
imagine
a
country
of
light
of
gaiety
of
courage
and
even
of
a
little
gallic
boasting
which
does
not
sort
ill
with
the
bold
youth
of
the
heart
he
believed
it
all
because
he
needed
to
believe
it
all
because
with
all
his
soul
he
would
have
liked
it
to
be
so
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
but
he
could
not
go
because
of
his
mother
louisa
was
growing
old
she
adored
her
son
who
was
her
only
joy
and
she
was
all
that
he
most
loved
on
earth
and
yet
they
were
always
hurting
each
other
she
hardly
understood
christophe
and
did
not
try
to
understand
him
she
was
only
concerned
to
love
him
she
had
a
narrow
timid
dull
mind
and
a
fine
heart
an
immense
need
of
loving
and
being
loved
in
which
there
was
something
touching
and
sad
she
respected
her
son
because
he
seemed
to
her
to
be
very
learned
but
she
did
all
she
could
to
stifle
his
genius
she
thought
he
would
stay
all
his
life
with
her
in
their
little
town
they
had
lived
together
for
years
and
she
could
not
imagine
that
he
would
not
always
be
the
same
she
was
happy
why
should
he
not
be
happy
too
all
her
dreams
for
him
soared
no
higher
than
seeing
him
married
to
some
prosperous
citizen
of
the
town
hearing
him
play
the
organ
at
church
on
sundays
and
never
having
him
leave
her
she
regarded
her
son
as
though
he
were
still
twelve
years
old
she
would
have
liked
him
never
to
be
more
than
that
innocently
she
inflicted
torture
on
the
unhappy
man
who
was
suffocated
in
that
narrow
world
and
yet
there
was
much
truth
moral
greatness
in
that
unconscious
philosophy
of
the
mother
who
could
not
understand
ambition
and
saw
all
the
happiness
of
life
in
the
family
affections
and
the
accomplishment
of
humble
duties
she
was
a
creature
who
wished
to
love
and
only
to
love
sooner
renounce
life
reason
logic
the
material
world
everything
rather
than
love
and
that
love
was
infinite
suppliant
exacting
it
gave
everything
it
wished
to
be
given
everything
it
renounced
life
for
love
and
it
desired
that
renunciation
from
others
from
the
beloved
what
a
power
is
the
love
of
a
simple
soul
it
makes
it
find
at
once
what
the
groping
reasoning
of
an
uncertain
genius
like
tolstoy
or
the
too
refined
art
of
a
dying
civilization
discovers
after
a
lifetime
ages
of
bitter
struggle
and
exhausting
effort
but
the
imperious
world
which
was
seething
in
christophe
had
very
different
laws
and
demanded
another
wisdom
for
a
long
time
he
had
been
wanting
to
announce
his
determination
to
his
mother
but
he
was
fearful
of
the
grief
it
would
bring
to
her
and
just
as
he
was
about
to
speak
he
would
lose
his
courage
and
put
it
off
two
or
three
times
he
did
timidly
allude
to
his
departure
but
louisa
did
not
take
him
seriously
perhaps
she
preferred
not
to
take
him
seriously
so
as
to
persuade
him
that
he
was
talking
in
jest
then
he
dared
not
go
on
but
he
would
remain
gloomy
and
thoughtful
or
it
was
apparent
that
he
had
some
secret
burden
upon
his
soul
and
the
poor
woman
who
had
an
intuition
as
to
the
nature
of
that
secret
tried
fearfully
to
delay
the
confession
of
it
sometimes
in
the
evening
when
they
were
sitting
silent
in
the
light
of
the
lamp
she
would
suddenly
feel
that
he
was
going
to
speak
and
then
in
terror
she
would
begin
to
talk
very
quickly
at
random
about
nothing
in
particular
she
hardly
knew
what
she
was
saying
but
at
all
costs
she
must
keep
him
from
speaking
generally
her
instinct
made
her
find
the
best
means
of
imposing
silence
on
him
she
would
complain
about
her
health
about
the
swelling
of
her
hands
and
feet
and
the
cramps
in
her
legs
she
would
exaggerate
her
sickness
call
herself
an
old
useless
woman
he
was
not
deceived
by
her
simple
tricks
he
would
look
at
her
sadly
in
dumb
reproach
and
after
a
moment
he
would
get
up
saying
that
he
was
tired
and
go
to
bed
but
all
her
devices
could
not
save
louisa
for
long
one
evening
when
she
resorted
to
them
once
more
christophe
gathered
his
courage
and
put
his
hand
on
his
mother
and
said
no
mother
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
louisa
was
horrified
but
she
tried
to
smile
and
say
chokingly
what
is
it
my
dear
christophe
stammered
out
his
intention
of
going
she
tried
to
take
it
as
a
joke
and
to
turn
the
conversation
as
usual
but
he
was
not
to
be
put
off
and
went
on
so
deliberately
and
so
seriously
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
doubt
then
she
said
nothing
her
pulse
stopped
and
she
sat
there
dumb
frozen
looking
at
him
with
terror
in
her
eyes
such
sorrow
showed
in
her
eyes
as
he
spoke
that
he
too
stopped
and
they
sat
both
speechless
when
at
last
she
was
able
to
recover
her
breath
she
said
her
lips
trembled
it
is
impossible
it
is
impossible
two
large
tears
trickled
down
her
cheeks
he
turned
his
head
away
in
despair
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
they
wept
after
some
time
he
went
to
his
room
and
shut
himself
up
until
the
morrow
they
made
no
reference
to
what
had
happened
and
as
he
did
not
speak
of
it
again
she
tried
to
pretend
that
he
had
abandoned
the
project
but
she
lived
on
tenterhooks
there
came
a
time
when
he
could
hold
himself
in
no
longer
he
had
to
speak
even
if
it
broke
his
heart
he
was
suffering
too
much
the
egoism
of
his
sorrow
mastered
the
idea
of
the
suffering
he
would
bring
to
her
he
spoke
he
went
through
with
it
never
looking
at
his
mother
for
fear
of
being
too
greatly
moved
he
fixed
the
day
for
his
departure
so
as
to
avoid
a
second
discussion
he
did
not
know
if
he
could
again
win
the
sad
courage
that
was
in
him
that
day
louisa
cried
no
no
stop
stop
he
set
his
teeth
and
went
on
implacably
when
he
had
finished
she
was
sobbing
he
took
her
hands
and
tried
to
make
her
understand
how
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
his
art
and
his
life
for
him
to
go
away
for
some
time
she
refused
to
listen
she
wept
and
said
no
no
i
will
not
after
trying
to
reason
with
her
in
vain
he
left
her
thinking
that
the
night
would
bring
about
a
change
in
her
ideas
but
when
they
met
next
day
at
breakfast
he
began
once
more
to
talk
of
his
plans
she
dropped
the
piece
of
bread
she
was
raising
to
her
lips
and
said
sorrowfully
and
reproachfully
why
do
you
want
to
torture
me
he
was
touched
but
he
said
dear
mother
i
must
no
no
she
replied
you
must
not
you
want
to
hurt
me
it
is
a
madness
they
tried
to
convince
each
other
but
they
did
not
listen
to
each
other
he
saw
that
argument
was
wasted
it
would
only
make
her
suffer
more
and
he
began
ostentatiously
to
prepare
for
his
departure
when
she
saw
that
no
entreaty
would
stop
him
louisa
relapsed
into
a
gloomy
stupor
she
spent
her
days
locked
up
in
her
room
and
without
a
light
when
evening
came
she
did
not
speak
or
eat
at
night
he
could
hear
her
weeping
he
was
racked
by
it
he
could
have
cried
out
in
his
grief
as
he
lay
all
night
twisting
and
turning
in
his
bed
sleeplessly
a
prey
to
his
remorse
he
loved
her
so
why
must
he
make
her
suffer
alas
she
would
not
be
the
only
one
he
saw
that
clearly
why
had
destiny
given
him
the
desire
and
strength
of
a
mission
which
must
make
those
whom
he
loved
suffer
ah
he
thought
if
i
were
free
if
i
were
not
drawn
on
by
the
cruel
need
of
being
what
i
must
be
or
else
of
dying
in
shame
and
disgust
with
myself
how
happy
would
i
make
you
you
whom
i
love
let
me
live
first
do
fight
suffer
and
then
i
will
come
hack
to
you
and
love
you
more
than
ever
how
i
would
like
only
to
love
love
love
he
never
could
have
been
strong
enough
to
resist
the
perpetual
reproach
of
the
soul
had
that
reproach
been
strong
enough
to
remain
silent
but
louisa
who
was
weak
and
rather
talkative
could
not
keep
the
sorrow
that
was
stifling
her
to
herself
she
told
her
neighbors
she
told
her
two
other
sons
they
could
not
miss
such
a
fine
opportunity
of
putting
christophe
in
the
wrong
rodolphe
especially
who
had
never
ceased
to
be
jealous
of
his
elder
brother
although
there
was
little
enough
reason
for
it
at
the
time
rodolphe
who
was
cut
to
the
quick
by
the
least
praise
of
christophe
and
was
secretly
afraid
of
his
future
success
though
he
never
dared
admit
so
base
a
thought
for
he
was
clever
enough
to
feel
his
brother
force
and
to
be
afraid
that
others
would
feel
it
too
rodolphe
was
only
too
happy
to
crush
christophe
beneath
the
weight
of
his
superiority
he
had
never
worried
much
about
his
mother
though
he
knew
her
straitened
circumstances
although
he
was
well
able
to
afford
to
help
her
he
left
it
all
to
christophe
but
when
he
heard
of
christophe
intention
he
discovered
at
once
hidden
treasures
of
affection
he
was
furious
at
his
proposing
to
leave
his
mother
and
called
it
monstrous
egoism
he
was
impudent
enough
to
tell
christophe
so
he
lectured
him
loftily
like
a
child
who
deserves
smacking
he
told
him
stiffly
of
his
duty
towards
his
mother
and
of
all
that
she
had
sacrificed
for
him
christophe
almost
burst
with
rage
he
kicked
rodolphe
out
and
called
him
a
rascal
and
a
hypocrite
rodolphe
avenged
himself
by
feeding
his
mother
indignation
excited
by
him
louisa
began
to
persuade
herself
that
christophe
was
behaving
like
a
bad
son
she
tried
to
declare
that
he
had
mo
right
to
go
and
she
was
only
too
willing
to
believe
it
instead
of
using
only
her
tears
which
were
her
strongest
weapon
she
reproached
christophe
bitterly
and
unjustly
and
disgusted
him
they
said
cruel
things
to
each
other
the
result
was
that
christophe
who
till
then
had
been
hesitating
only
thought
of
hastening
his
preparations
for
his
departure
he
knew
that
the
charitable
neighbors
were
commiserating
his
mother
and
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
neighborhood
she
was
regarded
as
a
victim
and
himself
as
a
monster
he
set
his
teeth
and
would
not
go
back
on
his
resolve
the
days
passed
christophe
and
louisa
hardly
spoke
to
each
other
instead
of
enjoying
to
the
last
drop
their
last
days
together
these
two
who
loved
each
other
wasted
the
time
that
was
left
as
too
often
happens
in
one
of
those
sterile
fits
of
sullenness
in
which
so
many
affections
are
swallowed
up
they
only
met
at
meals
when
they
sat
opposite
each
other
not
looking
at
each
other
never
speaking
forcing
themselves
to
eat
a
few
mouthfuls
not
so
much
for
the
sake
of
eating
as
for
the
sake
of
appearances
christophe
would
contrive
to
mumble
a
few
words
but
louisa
would
not
reply
and
when
she
tried
to
talk
he
would
be
silent
this
state
of
things
was
intolerable
to
both
of
them
and
the
longer
it
went
on
the
more
difficult
it
became
to
break
it
were
they
going
to
part
like
that
louisa
admitted
that
she
had
been
unjust
and
awkward
but
she
was
suffering
too
much
to
know
how
to
win
back
her
son
love
which
she
thought
she
had
lost
and
at
all
costs
to
prevent
his
departure
the
idea
of
which
she
refused
to
face
christophe
stole
glances
at
his
mother
pale
swollen
face
and
he
was
torn
by
remorse
but
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
go
and
knowing
that
he
was
going
forever
out
of
her
life
he
wished
cowardly
to
be
gone
to
escape
his
remorse
his
departure
was
fixed
for
the
next
day
but
one
one
of
their
sad
meals
had
just
come
to
an
end
when
they
finished
their
supper
during
which
they
had
not
spoken
a
word
christophe
withdrew
to
his
room
and
sitting
at
his
desk
with
his
head
in
his
hands
he
was
incapable
of
working
he
became
lost
in
thought
the
night
was
drawing
late
it
was
nearly
one
in
the
morning
suddenly
he
heard
a
noise
a
chair
upset
in
the
next
room
the
door
opened
and
his
mother
appeared
in
her
nightgown
barefooted
and
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
sobbed
she
was
feverish
she
kissed
her
son
and
moaned
through
her
despairing
sobs
do
go
do
go
i
implore
you
i
implore
you
my
dear
do
go
i
shall
die
i
ca
i
ca
bear
it
he
was
alarmed
and
upset
he
kissed
her
and
said
dear
mother
calm
yourself
please
please
but
she
went
on
i
ca
bear
it
i
have
only
you
if
you
go
what
will
become
of
me
i
shall
die
if
you
go
i
do
want
to
die
away
from
you
i
do
want
to
die
alone
wait
until
i
am
dead
her
words
rent
his
heart
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
console
her
what
arguments
could
hold
good
against
such
an
outpouring
of
love
and
sorrow
he
took
her
on
his
knees
and
tried
to
calm
her
with
kisses
and
little
affectionate
words
the
old
woman
gradually
became
silent
and
wept
softly
when
she
was
a
little
comforted
he
said
go
to
bed
you
will
catch
cold
she
repeated
do
go
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
will
not
go
she
trembled
and
took
his
hand
truly
she
said
truly
he
turned
his
head
away
sadly
he
answered
i
will
tell
you
leave
me
now
please
she
got
up
meekly
and
went
back
to
her
room
next
morning
she
was
ashamed
of
her
despairing
outburst
which
had
come
upon
her
like
a
madness
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
she
was
fearful
of
what
her
son
would
say
to
her
she
waited
for
him
sitting
in
a
corner
of
the
room
she
had
taken
up
some
knitting
for
occupation
but
her
hands
refused
to
hold
it
she
let
it
fall
christophe
entered
they
greeted
each
other
in
a
whisper
without
looking
at
each
other
he
was
gloomy
and
went
and
stood
by
the
window
with
his
back
to
his
mother
and
he
stayed
without
speaking
there
was
a
great
struggle
in
him
he
knew
the
result
of
it
already
and
was
trying
to
delay
the
issue
louisa
dared
not
speak
a
word
to
him
and
provoke
the
answer
which
she
expected
and
feared
she
forced
herself
to
take
up
her
knitting
again
but
she
could
not
see
what
she
was
doing
and
she
dropped
her
stitches
outside
it
was
raining
after
a
long
silence
christophe
came
to
her
she
did
not
stir
but
her
heart
was
beating
christophe
stood
still
and
looked
at
her
then
suddenly
he
went
down
on
his
knees
and
hid
his
face
in
his
mother
dress
and
without
saying
a
word
he
wept
then
she
understood
that
he
was
going
to
stay
and
her
heart
was
filled
with
a
mortal
agony
of
joy
but
at
once
she
was
seized
by
remorse
for
she
felt
all
that
her
son
was
sacrificing
for
her
and
she
began
to
suffer
all
that
christophe
had
suffered
when
it
was
she
whom
he
sacrificed
she
bent
over
him
and
covered
his
brow
and
his
hair
with
kisses
in
silence
their
tears
and
their
sorrow
mingled
at
last
he
raised
his
head
and
louisa
took
his
face
in
her
hands
and
looked
into
his
eyes
she
would
have
liked
to
say
to
him
go
but
she
could
not
he
would
have
liked
to
say
to
her
i
am
glad
to
stay
but
he
could
not
the
situation
was
hopeless
neither
of
them
could
alter
it
she
sighed
in
her
sorrow
and
love
ah
if
we
could
all
be
born
and
all
die
together
her
simple
way
filled
him
with
tenderness
he
dried
his
tears
and
tried
to
smile
and
said
we
shall
all
die
together
she
insisted
truly
you
will
not
go
he
got
up
i
have
said
so
do
let
us
talk
about
it
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
christophe
kept
his
word
he
never
talked
of
going
again
but
he
could
not
help
thinking
of
it
he
stayed
but
he
made
his
mother
pay
dearly
for
his
sacrifice
by
his
sadness
and
bad
temper
and
louisa
tactlessly
much
more
tactlessly
than
she
knew
never
failing
to
do
what
she
ought
not
to
have
done
louisa
who
knew
only
too
well
the
reason
of
his
grief
insisted
on
his
telling
her
what
it
was
she
worried
him
with
her
affection
uneasy
vexing
argumentative
reminding
him
every
moment
that
they
were
very
different
from
each
other
and
that
he
was
trying
to
forget
how
often
he
had
tried
to
open
his
heart
to
her
but
just
as
he
was
about
to
speak
the
great
wall
of
china
would
rise
between
them
and
he
would
keep
his
secrets
buried
in
himself
she
would
guess
but
she
never
dared
invite
his
confidence
or
else
she
could
not
when
she
tried
she
would
succeed
only
in
flinging
back
in
him
those
secrets
which
weighed
so
sorely
on
him
and
which
he
was
so
longing
to
tell
a
thousand
little
things
harmless
tricks
cut
her
off
from
him
and
irritated
christophe
the
good
old
creature
was
doting
she
had
to
talk
about
the
local
gossip
and
she
had
that
nurse
tenderness
which
will
recall
all
the
silly
little
things
of
the
earliest
years
and
everything
that
is
associated
with
the
cradle
we
have
such
difficulty
in
issuing
from
it
and
growing
into
men
and
women
and
juliet
nurse
must
forever
be
laying
before
us
our
clothes
commonplace
thoughts
the
whole
unhappy
period
in
which
the
growing
soul
struggles
against
the
oppression
of
vile
matter
or
stifling
surroundings
and
with
it
all
she
had
little
outbursts
of
touching
tenderness
as
though
to
a
little
child
which
used
to
move
him
greatly
and
he
would
surrender
to
them
like
a
little
child
the
worst
of
all
to
bear
was
living
from
morning
to
night
as
they
did
together
always
together
isolated
from
the
rest
of
the
world
when
two
people
suffer
and
can
not
help
each
other
suffering
exasperation
is
fatal
each
in
the
end
holds
the
other
responsible
for
the
suffering
and
each
in
the
end
believes
it
it
were
better
to
be
alone
alone
in
suffering
it
was
a
daily
torment
for
both
of
them
they
would
never
have
broken
free
if
chance
had
not
come
to
break
the
cruel
indecision
against
which
they
were
struggling
in
a
way
that
seemed
unfortunate
but
it
was
really
fortunate
it
was
a
sunday
in
october
four
in
the
afternoon
the
weather
was
brilliant
christophe
had
stayed
in
his
room
all
day
chewing
the
cud
of
melancholy
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
he
wanted
desperately
to
go
out
to
walk
to
expend
his
energy
to
tire
himself
out
so
as
to
stop
thinking
relations
with
his
mother
had
been
strained
since
the
day
before
he
was
just
going
out
without
saying
to
her
but
on
the
stairs
he
thought
how
it
would
hurt
her
the
whole
evening
when
she
was
left
alone
he
went
back
making
an
excuse
of
having
left
something
in
his
room
the
door
of
his
mother
room
was
ajar
he
put
his
head
in
through
the
aperture
he
watched
his
mother
for
a
few
moments
what
a
place
those
two
seconds
were
to
fill
in
his
life
ever
after
louisa
had
just
come
in
from
vespers
she
was
sitting
in
her
favorite
place
the
recess
of
the
window
the
wall
of
the
house
opposite
dirty
white
and
cracked
obstructed
the
view
but
from
the
corner
where
she
sat
she
could
see
to
the
right
through
the
yards
of
the
next
houses
a
little
patch
of
lawn
the
size
of
a
on
the
a
pot
of
convolvulus
climbed
along
its
threads
and
over
this
frail
ladder
stretched
its
tendrils
which
were
caressed
by
a
ray
of
sunlight
louisa
was
sitting
in
a
low
chair
bending
over
her
great
bible
which
was
open
on
her
lap
but
she
was
not
reading
her
hands
were
laid
flat
on
the
book
her
hands
with
their
swollen
veins
worker
nails
square
and
a
little
bent
and
she
was
devouring
with
loving
eyes
the
little
plant
and
the
patch
of
sky
she
could
see
through
it
a
sunbeam
basking
on
the
green
gold
leaves
lit
up
her
tired
face
with
its
rather
blotchy
complexion
her
white
soft
and
rather
thick
hair
and
her
lips
parted
in
a
smile
she
was
enjoying
her
hour
of
rest
it
was
the
best
moment
of
the
week
to
her
she
made
use
of
it
to
sink
into
that
state
so
sweet
to
those
who
suffer
when
thoughts
dwell
on
nothing
and
in
torpor
nothing
speaks
save
the
heart
and
that
is
half
asleep
mother
he
said
i
want
to
go
out
i
am
going
by
buir
i
shall
be
rather
late
louisa
who
was
dozing
off
trembled
a
little
then
she
turned
her
head
towards
him
and
looked
at
him
with
her
calm
kind
eyes
yes
my
dear
go
she
said
you
are
right
make
use
of
the
fine
weather
she
smiled
at
him
he
smiled
at
her
they
looked
at
each
other
for
a
moment
then
they
said
affectionately
nodding
and
smiling
with
the
eyes
he
closed
the
door
softly
she
slipped
back
into
her
reverie
which
her
son
smile
had
lit
up
with
a
bright
ray
of
light
like
the
sunbeam
on
the
pale
leaves
of
the
convolvulus
so
he
left
her
forever
an
october
evening
a
pale
watery
sun
the
drowsy
country
is
sinking
to
sleep
little
village
bells
are
slowly
ringing
in
the
silence
of
the
fields
columns
of
smoke
rise
slowly
in
the
midst
of
the
plowed
fields
a
fine
mist
hovers
in
the
distance
the
white
fogs
are
awaiting
the
coming
of
the
night
to
rise
a
dog
with
his
nose
to
the
ground
was
running
in
circles
in
a
field
of
beet
great
flocks
of
crows
whirled
against
the
gray
sky
christophe
went
on
dreaming
having
no
fixed
object
but
yet
instinctively
he
was
walking
in
a
definite
direction
for
several
weeks
his
walks
round
the
town
had
gravitated
whether
he
liked
it
or
not
towards
another
village
where
he
was
sure
to
meet
a
pretty
girl
who
attracted
him
it
was
only
an
attraction
but
it
was
very
vivid
and
rather
disturbing
christophe
could
hardly
do
without
loving
some
one
and
his
heart
was
rarely
left
empty
it
always
had
some
lovely
image
for
its
idol
generally
it
did
not
matter
whether
the
idol
knew
of
his
love
his
need
was
to
love
the
fire
must
never
be
allowed
to
go
out
there
must
never
be
darkness
in
his
heart
the
object
of
this
new
flame
was
the
daughter
of
a
peasant
whom
he
had
met
as
eliézer
met
rebecca
by
a
well
but
she
did
not
give
him
to
drink
she
threw
water
in
his
face
she
was
kneeling
by
the
edge
of
a
stream
in
a
hollow
in
the
bank
between
two
willows
the
roots
of
which
made
a
sort
of
nest
about
her
she
was
washing
linen
vigorously
and
her
tongue
was
not
less
active
than
her
arms
she
was
talking
and
laughing
loudly
with
other
girls
of
the
village
who
were
washing
opposite
her
or
the
other
side
of
the
stream
christophe
was
lying
in
the
grass
a
few
yards
away
and
with
his
chin
resting
in
his
hands
he
watched
them
they
were
not
put
out
by
it
they
went
on
chattering
in
a
style
which
sometimes
did
not
lack
bluntness
he
hardly
listened
he
heard
only
the
sound
of
their
merry
voices
mingling
with
the
noise
of
their
washing
pots
and
with
the
distant
lowing
of
the
cows
in
the
meadows
and
he
was
dreaming
never
taking
his
eyes
off
the
beautiful
washerwoman
a
bright
young
face
would
make
him
glad
for
a
whole
day
it
was
not
long
before
the
girls
made
out
which
of
them
he
was
looking
at
and
they
made
caustic
remarks
to
each
other
the
girl
he
preferred
was
not
the
least
cutting
in
the
observations
she
threw
at
him
as
he
did
not
budge
she
got
up
took
a
bundle
of
linen
washed
and
wrung
and
began
to
lay
it
out
on
the
bushes
near
him
so
as
to
have
an
excuse
for
looking
at
him
as
she
passed
him
she
continued
to
splash
him
with
her
wet
clothes
and
she
looked
at
him
boldly
and
laughed
she
was
thin
and
strong
she
had
a
fine
chin
a
little
underhung
a
short
nose
arching
eyebrows
blue
eyes
bold
bright
and
hard
a
pretty
mouth
with
thick
lips
pouting
a
little
like
those
of
a
greek
maid
a
mass
of
fair
hair
turned
up
in
a
knot
on
her
head
and
a
full
color
she
carried
her
head
very
erect
tittered
at
every
word
she
said
and
even
when
she
said
nothing
and
walked
like
a
man
swinging
her
sunburned
arms
she
went
on
laying
out
hey
linen
while
she
looked
at
christophe
with
a
provoking
smile
waiting
for
him
to
speak
christophe
stared
at
her
too
but
he
had
no
desire
to
talk
to
her
at
last
she
burst
out
laughing
to
his
face
and
turned
back
towards
her
companions
he
stayed
lying
where
he
was
until
evening
fell
and
he
saw
her
go
with
her
bundle
on
her
back
and
her
bare
arms
crossed
her
back
bent
under
her
load
still
talking
and
laughing
he
saw
her
again
a
few
days
later
at
the
town
market
among
heaps
of
carrots
and
tomatoes
and
cucumbers
and
cabbages
he
lounged
about
watching
the
crowd
of
women
selling
who
were
standing
in
a
line
by
their
baskets
like
slaves
for
sale
the
police
official
went
up
to
each
of
them
with
his
satchel
and
roll
of
tickets
receiving
a
piece
of
money
and
giving
a
paper
the
coffee
seller
went
from
row
to
row
with
a
basket
full
of
little
coffee
pots
and
an
old
nun
plump
and
jovial
went
round
the
market
with
two
large
baskets
on
her
arms
and
without
any
sort
of
humility
begged
vegetables
or
talked
of
the
good
god
the
women
shouted
the
old
scales
with
their
green
painted
pans
jingled
and
clanked
with
the
noise
of
their
chains
the
big
dogs
harnessed
to
the
little
carts
barked
loudly
proud
of
their
importance
in
the
midst
of
the
rabble
christophe
saw
her
real
name
was
lorchen
eleanor
on
her
fair
hair
she
had
placed
a
large
cabbage
leaf
green
and
white
which
made
a
dainty
lace
cap
for
her
she
was
sitting
on
a
basket
by
a
heap
of
golden
onions
little
pink
turnips
haricot
beans
and
ruddy
apples
and
she
was
munching
her
own
apples
one
after
another
without
trying
to
sell
them
she
never
stopped
eating
from
time
to
time
she
would
dry
her
chin
and
wipe
it
with
her
apron
brush
back
her
hair
with
her
arm
rub
her
cheek
against
her
shoulder
or
her
nose
with
the
back
of
her
hand
or
with
her
hands
on
her
knees
she
would
go
on
and
on
throwing
a
handful
of
shelled
peas
from
one
to
the
other
and
she
would
look
to
right
and
left
idly
and
indifferently
but
she
missed
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
about
her
and
without
seeming
to
do
so
she
marked
every
glance
cast
in
her
direction
she
saw
christophe
as
she
talked
to
her
customers
she
had
a
way
of
raising
her
eyebrows
and
looking
at
her
admirer
over
their
heads
she
was
as
dignified
and
serious
as
a
pope
but
inwardly
she
was
laughing
at
christophe
and
he
deserved
it
he
stood
there
a
few
yards
away
devouring
her
with
his
eyes
then
he
went
away
without
speaking
to
her
he
had
not
the
least
desire
to
do
so
he
came
back
more
than
once
to
prowl
round
the
market
and
the
village
where
she
lived
she
would
be
about
the
yard
of
the
farm
he
would
stop
on
the
road
to
look
at
her
he
did
not
admit
that
he
came
to
see
her
and
indeed
he
did
so
almost
unconsciously
when
as
often
happened
he
was
absorbed
by
the
composition
of
some
work
he
would
be
rather
like
a
somnambulist
while
his
conscious
soul
was
following
its
musical
ideas
the
rest
of
him
would
be
delivered
up
to
the
other
unconscious
soul
which
is
forever
watching
for
the
smallest
distraction
of
the
mind
to
take
the
freedom
of
the
fields
he
was
often
bewildered
by
the
buzzing
of
his
musical
ideas
when
he
was
face
to
face
with
her
and
he
would
go
on
dreaming
as
he
watched
her
he
could
not
have
said
that
he
loved
her
he
did
not
even
think
of
that
it
gave
him
pleasure
to
see
her
nothing
more
he
did
not
take
stock
of
the
desire
which
was
always
bringing
him
back
to
her
his
insistence
was
remarked
the
people
at
the
farm
joked
about
it
for
they
had
discovered
who
christophe
was
but
they
left
him
in
peace
for
he
was
quite
harmless
he
looked
silly
enough
in
truth
but
he
never
bothered
about
it
there
was
a
holiday
in
the
village
little
boys
were
crushing
crackers
between
stones
and
shouting
god
save
the
emperor
lebe
hoch
a
cow
shut
up
in
the
barn
and
the
men
drinking
at
the
inn
were
to
be
heard
kites
with
long
tails
like
comets
dipped
and
swung
in
the
air
above
the
fields
the
fowls
were
scratching
frantically
in
the
straw
and
the
golden
the
wind
blew
out
their
feathers
like
the
skirts
of
an
old
lady
a
pink
pig
was
sleeping
voluptuously
on
his
side
in
the
sun
christophe
made
his
way
towards
the
red
roof
of
the
inn
of
the
above
which
floated
a
little
flag
strings
of
onions
hung
by
the
door
and
the
windows
were
decorated
with
red
and
yellow
flowers
he
went
into
the
saloon
filled
with
tobacco
smoke
where
yellowing
chromos
hung
on
the
walls
and
in
the
place
of
honor
a
colored
portrait
of
the
surrounded
with
a
wreath
of
oak
leaves
people
were
dancing
christophe
was
sure
his
charmer
would
be
there
he
sat
in
a
corner
of
the
room
from
which
he
could
watch
the
movement
of
the
dancers
undisturbed
but
in
spite
of
all
this
care
to
pass
unnoticed
lorchen
spied
him
out
in
his
corner
while
she
waltzed
indefatigably
she
threw
quick
glances
at
him
over
her
shoulder
to
make
sure
that
he
was
still
looking
at
her
and
it
amused
her
to
excite
him
she
coquetted
with
the
young
men
of
the
village
laughing
the
while
with
her
wide
mouth
she
talked
a
great
deal
and
said
silly
things
and
was
not
very
different
from
the
girls
of
the
polite
world
who
think
they
must
laugh
and
move
about
and
play
to
the
gallery
when
anybody
looks
at
them
instead
of
keeping
their
foolishness
to
themselves
but
they
are
not
so
very
foolish
either
for
they
know
quite
well
that
the
gallery
only
looks
at
them
and
does
not
listen
to
what
they
with
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
his
chin
in
his
hands
christophe
watched
the
girl
tricks
with
burning
furious
eyes
his
mind
was
free
enough
not
to
be
taken
in
by
her
wiles
but
he
was
not
enough
himself
not
to
be
led
on
by
them
and
he
growled
with
rage
and
he
laughed
in
silence
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
falling
into
the
snare
not
only
the
girl
was
watching
him
lorchen
father
also
had
his
eyes
on
him
and
short
a
big
head
with
a
short
nose
sunburned
skull
with
a
fringe
of
hair
that
had
been
fair
and
hung
in
thick
curls
like
dürer
john
expressionless
face
with
a
long
pipe
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
he
was
talking
very
deliberately
to
some
other
peasants
while
all
the
time
he
was
watching
pantomime
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
and
he
laughed
softly
after
a
moment
he
coughed
and
a
malicious
light
shone
in
his
little
gray
eyes
and
he
came
and
sat
at
christophe
table
christophe
was
annoyed
and
turned
and
scowled
at
him
he
met
the
cunning
look
of
the
old
man
who
addressed
christophe
familiarly
without
taking
his
pipe
from
his
lips
christophe
knew
him
he
knew
him
for
a
common
old
man
but
his
weakness
for
his
daughter
made
him
indulgent
towards
the
father
and
even
gave
him
a
queer
pleasure
in
being
with
him
the
old
rascal
saw
that
after
talking
about
rain
and
fine
weather
and
some
chaffing
reference
to
the
pretty
girls
in
the
room
and
a
remark
on
christophe
not
dancing
he
concluded
that
christophe
was
right
not
to
put
himself
out
and
that
it
was
much
better
to
sit
at
table
with
a
mug
in
his
hand
without
ceremony
he
invited
himself
to
have
a
drink
while
he
drank
the
old
man
went
on
talking
deliberately
as
always
he
spoke
about
his
affairs
the
difficulty
of
gaining
a
livelihood
the
bad
weather
and
high
prices
christophe
hardly
listened
and
only
replied
with
an
occasional
grunt
he
was
not
interested
he
was
looking
at
lorchen
christophe
wondered
what
had
procured
him
the
honor
of
the
old
man
company
and
confidences
at
last
he
understood
when
the
old
man
had
exhausted
his
complaints
he
passed
on
to
another
chapter
he
praised
the
quality
of
his
produce
his
vegetables
his
fowls
his
eggs
his
milk
and
suddenly
he
asked
if
christophe
could
not
procure
him
the
custom
of
the
palace
christophe
started
how
the
devil
did
he
know
he
knew
him
then
oh
yes
said
the
old
man
everything
is
known
he
did
not
add
when
you
take
the
trouble
to
make
enquiries
but
christophe
added
it
for
him
he
took
a
wicked
pleasure
in
telling
him
that
although
everything
was
known
he
was
no
doubt
unaware
that
he
had
just
quarreled
with
the
court
and
that
if
he
had
ever
been
able
to
flatter
himself
on
having
some
credit
with
the
servants
quarters
and
butchers
of
the
palace
which
he
doubted
strongly
that
credit
at
present
was
dead
and
buried
the
old
man
lips
twitched
imperceptibly
however
he
was
not
put
out
and
after
a
moment
he
asked
if
christophe
could
not
at
least
recommend
him
to
such
and
such
a
family
and
he
mentioned
all
those
with
whom
christophe
had
had
dealings
for
he
had
informed
himself
of
them
at
the
market
and
there
was
no
danger
of
his
forgetting
any
detail
that
might
be
useful
to
him
christophe
would
have
been
furious
at
such
spying
upon
him
had
he
not
rather
wanted
to
laugh
at
the
thought
that
the
old
man
would
be
robbed
in
spite
of
all
his
cunning
for
he
had
no
doubt
of
the
value
of
the
recommendation
he
was
asking
a
recommendation
more
likely
to
make
him
lose
his
customers
than
to
procure
him
fresh
ones
so
he
let
him
empty
all
his
bag
of
clumsy
tricks
and
answered
neither
yes
nor
no
but
the
peasant
persisted
and
finally
he
came
down
to
christophe
and
louisa
whom
he
had
kept
for
the
end
and
expressed
his
keen
desire
to
provide
them
with
milk
butter
and
cream
he
added
that
as
christophe
was
a
musician
nothing
was
so
good
for
the
voice
as
a
fresh
egg
swallowed
raw
morning
and
evening
and
he
tried
hard
to
make
him
let
him
provide
him
with
these
warm
from
the
hen
the
idea
of
the
old
peasant
taking
him
for
a
singer
made
christophe
roar
with
laughter
the
peasant
took
advantage
of
that
to
order
another
bottle
and
then
having
got
all
he
could
out
of
christophe
for
the
time
being
he
went
away
without
further
ceremony
night
had
fallen
the
dancing
had
become
more
and
more
excited
lorchen
had
ceased
to
pay
any
attention
to
christophe
she
was
too
busy
turning
the
head
of
a
young
lout
of
the
village
the
son
of
a
rich
farmer
for
whom
all
the
girls
were
competing
christophe
was
interested
by
the
struggle
the
young
women
smiled
at
each
other
and
would
have
been
only
too
pleased
to
scratch
each
other
christophe
forgot
himself
and
prayed
for
the
triumph
of
lorchen
but
when
her
triumph
was
won
he
felt
a
little
downcast
he
was
enraged
by
it
he
did
not
love
lorchen
he
did
not
want
to
be
loved
by
her
it
was
natural
that
she
should
love
anybody
she
no
doubt
but
it
was
not
pleasant
to
receive
so
little
sympathy
himself
when
he
had
so
much
need
of
giving
and
receiving
here
as
in
the
town
he
was
alone
all
these
people
were
only
interested
in
him
while
they
could
make
use
of
him
and
then
laugh
at
him
he
sighed
smiled
as
he
looked
at
lorchen
whom
her
joy
in
the
discomfiture
of
her
rivals
had
made
ten
times
prettier
than
ever
and
got
ready
to
go
it
was
nearly
nine
he
had
fully
two
miles
to
go
to
the
town
he
got
up
from
the
table
when
the
door
opened
and
a
handful
of
soldiers
burst
in
their
entry
dashed
the
gaiety
of
the
place
the
people
began
to
whisper
a
few
couples
stopped
dancing
to
look
uneasily
at
the
new
arrivals
the
peasants
standing
near
the
door
deliberately
turned
their
backs
on
them
and
began
to
talk
among
themselves
but
without
seeming
to
do
so
they
presently
contrived
to
leave
room
for
them
to
pass
for
some
time
past
the
whole
neighborhood
had
been
at
loggerheads
with
the
garrisons
of
the
fortresses
round
it
the
soldiers
were
bored
to
death
and
wreaked
their
vengeance
on
the
peasants
they
made
coarse
fun
of
them
maltreated
them
and
used
the
women
as
though
they
were
in
a
conquered
country
the
week
before
some
of
them
full
of
wine
had
disturbed
a
feast
at
a
neighboring
village
and
had
half
killed
a
farmer
christophe
who
knew
these
things
shared
the
state
of
mind
of
the
peasant
and
he
sat
down
again
and
waited
to
see
what
would
happen
the
soldiers
were
not
worried
by
the
with
which
their
entry
was
received
and
went
noisily
and
sat
down
at
the
full
tables
jostling
the
people
away
from
them
to
make
room
it
was
the
affair
of
a
moment
most
of
the
people
went
away
grumbling
an
old
man
sitting
at
the
end
of
a
bench
did
not
move
quickly
enough
they
lifted
the
bench
and
the
old
man
toppled
over
amid
roars
of
laughter
christophe
felt
the
blood
rushing
to
his
head
he
got
up
indignantly
but
as
he
was
on
the
point
of
interfering
he
saw
the
old
man
painfully
pick
himself
up
and
instead
of
complaining
humbly
crave
pardon
two
of
the
soldiers
came
to
christophe
table
he
watched
them
come
and
clenched
his
fists
but
he
did
not
have
to
defend
himself
they
were
two
tall
strong
louts
who
had
followed
sheepishly
one
or
two
daredevils
and
were
trying
to
imitate
them
they
were
intimidated
by
christophe
defiant
manner
and
when
he
said
curtly
this
place
is
taken
they
hastily
begged
his
pardon
and
withdrew
to
their
end
of
the
bench
so
as
not
to
disturb
him
there
had
been
a
masterful
inflection
in
his
voice
their
natural
servility
came
to
the
fore
they
saw
that
christophe
was
not
a
peasant
christophe
was
a
little
mollified
by
their
submission
and
was
able
to
watch
things
more
coolly
it
was
not
difficult
to
see
that
the
gang
were
led
by
a
officer
a
little
of
a
man
with
hard
eyes
with
a
rascally
hypocritical
and
wicked
face
he
was
one
of
the
heroes
of
the
affray
of
the
sunday
before
he
was
sitting
at
the
table
next
to
christophe
he
was
drunk
already
and
stared
at
the
people
and
threw
insulting
sarcasms
at
them
which
they
pretended
not
to
hear
he
attacked
especially
the
couples
dancing
describing
their
physical
advantages
or
defects
with
a
coarseness
of
expression
which
made
his
companions
laugh
the
girls
blushed
and
tears
came
to
their
eyes
the
young
men
ground
their
teeth
and
raged
in
silence
their
tormentor
eyes
wandered
slowly
round
the
room
sparing
nobody
christophe
saw
them
moving
towards
himself
he
seized
his
mug
and
clenched
his
fist
on
the
table
and
waited
determined
to
throw
the
liquor
at
his
head
on
the
first
insult
he
said
to
himself
i
am
mad
it
would
be
better
to
go
away
they
will
slit
me
up
and
then
if
i
escape
they
will
put
me
in
prison
the
game
is
not
worth
the
candle
better
go
before
he
provokes
me
but
his
pride
would
not
let
him
he
would
not
seem
to
be
running
away
from
such
brutes
as
these
the
officer
cunning
brutal
stare
was
fixed
on
him
christophe
stiffened
and
glared
at
him
angrily
the
officer
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
christophe
face
irritated
him
he
nudged
his
neighbor
and
pointed
out
the
young
man
with
a
snigger
and
he
opened
his
lips
to
insult
him
christophe
gathered
himself
together
and
was
just
about
to
fling
his
mug
at
him
once
more
chance
saved
him
just
as
the
drunken
man
was
about
to
speak
an
awkward
couple
of
dancers
bumped
into
him
and
made
him
drop
his
glass
he
turned
furiously
and
let
loose
a
flood
of
insults
his
attention
was
distracted
he
forgot
christophe
christophe
waited
for
a
few
minutes
longer
then
seeing
that
his
enemy
had
no
thought
of
going
on
with
his
remarks
he
got
up
slowly
took
his
hat
and
walked
leisurely
towards
the
door
he
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
the
bench
where
the
other
was
sitting
just
to
let
him
feel
that
he
was
not
giving
in
to
him
but
the
officer
had
forgotten
him
altogether
no
one
took
any
notice
of
him
he
was
just
turning
the
handle
of
the
door
in
a
few
seconds
he
would
have
been
outside
but
it
was
ordered
that
he
should
not
leave
so
soon
an
angry
murmur
rose
at
the
end
of
the
room
when
the
soldiers
had
drunk
they
had
decided
to
dance
and
as
all
the
girls
had
their
cavaliers
they
drove
away
their
partners
who
submitted
to
it
but
lorchen
was
not
going
to
put
up
with
that
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
she
had
her
bold
eyes
and
her
firm
chin
which
so
charmed
christophe
she
was
waltzing
like
a
mad
thing
when
the
officer
who
had
fixed
his
choice
upon
her
came
and
pulled
her
partner
away
from
her
she
stamped
with
her
foot
screamed
and
pushed
the
soldier
away
declaring
that
she
would
never
dance
with
such
a
boor
he
pursued
her
he
dispersed
with
his
fists
the
people
behind
whom
she
was
trying
to
hide
at
last
she
took
refuge
behind
a
table
and
then
protected
from
him
for
a
moment
she
took
breath
to
scream
abuse
at
him
she
saw
that
all
her
resistance
would
be
useless
and
she
stamped
with
rage
and
groped
for
the
most
violent
words
to
fling
at
him
and
compared
his
face
to
that
of
various
animals
of
the
he
leaned
towards
her
over
the
table
smiled
wickedly
and
his
eyes
glittered
with
rage
suddenly
he
pounced
and
jumped
over
the
table
he
caught
hold
of
her
she
struggled
with
feet
and
fists
like
the
she
was
he
was
not
too
steady
on
his
legs
and
almost
lost
his
balance
in
his
fury
he
flung
her
against
the
wall
and
slapped
her
face
he
had
no
time
to
do
it
again
some
one
had
jumped
on
his
back
and
was
cuffing
him
and
kicking
him
back
into
the
crowd
it
was
christophe
who
had
flung
himself
on
him
overturning
tables
and
people
without
stopping
to
think
of
what
he
was
doing
mad
with
rage
the
officer
turned
and
drew
his
saber
before
he
could
make
use
of
it
christophe
felled
him
with
a
stool
the
whole
thing
had
been
so
sudden
that
none
of
the
spectators
had
time
to
think
of
interfering
the
other
soldiers
ran
to
christophe
drawing
their
sabers
the
peasants
flung
themselves
at
them
the
uproar
became
general
mugs
flew
across
the
room
the
tables
were
overturned
the
peasants
woke
up
they
had
old
scores
to
pay
off
the
men
rolled
about
on
the
ground
and
bit
each
other
savagely
lorchen
partner
a
stolid
had
caught
hold
of
the
head
of
the
soldier
who
had
just
insulted
him
and
was
banging
it
furiously
against
the
wall
lorchen
armed
with
a
cudgel
was
striking
out
blindly
the
other
girls
ran
away
screaming
except
for
a
few
wantons
who
joined
in
heartily
one
of
them
a
fat
little
fair
girl
seeing
a
gigantic
soldier
the
same
who
had
sat
at
christophe
table
crushing
in
the
chest
of
his
prostrate
adversary
with
his
boot
ran
to
the
fire
came
back
dragged
the
brute
head
backwards
and
flung
a
handful
of
burning
ashes
into
his
eyes
the
man
bellowed
the
girl
gloated
abused
the
disarmed
enemy
whom
the
peasants
now
thwacked
at
their
ease
at
last
the
soldiers
finding
themselves
on
the
losing
side
rushed
away
leaving
two
of
their
number
on
the
floor
the
fight
went
on
in
the
village
street
they
burst
into
the
houses
crying
murder
and
trying
to
smash
everything
the
peasants
followed
them
with
forks
and
set
their
savage
dogs
on
them
a
third
soldier
fell
with
his
belly
cleft
by
a
fork
the
others
had
to
fly
and
were
hunted
out
of
the
village
and
from
a
distance
they
shouted
as
they
ran
across
the
fields
that
they
would
fetch
their
comrades
and
come
back
immediately
the
peasants
left
masters
of
the
field
returned
to
the
inn
they
were
exultant
it
was
a
revenge
for
all
the
outrages
they
had
suffered
for
so
long
they
had
as
yet
no
thought
of
the
consequences
of
the
affray
they
all
talked
at
once
and
boasted
of
their
prowess
they
fraternized
with
christophe
who
was
delighted
to
feel
in
touch
with
them
lorchen
came
and
took
his
hand
and
held
it
for
a
moment
in
her
rough
paw
while
she
giggled
at
him
she
did
not
think
him
ridiculous
for
the
moment
they
looked
to
the
wounded
among
the
villagers
there
were
only
a
few
teeth
knocked
out
a
few
ribs
broken
and
a
few
slight
bruises
and
scars
but
it
was
very
different
with
the
soldiers
they
were
seriously
injured
the
giant
whose
eyes
had
been
burned
had
had
his
shoulder
half
cut
off
with
a
hatchet
the
man
whose
belly
had
been
pierced
was
dying
and
there
was
the
officer
who
had
been
knocked
down
by
christophe
they
were
laid
out
by
the
hearth
the
officer
who
was
the
least
injured
of
the
three
had
just
opened
his
eyes
he
took
a
long
look
at
the
ring
of
peasants
leaning
over
him
a
look
filled
with
hatred
hardly
had
he
regained
consciousness
of
what
had
happened
than
he
began
to
abuse
them
he
swore
that
he
would
be
avenged
and
would
settle
their
hash
the
whole
lot
of
them
he
choked
with
rage
it
was
palpable
that
if
he
could
he
would
exterminate
them
they
tried
to
laugh
but
their
laughter
was
forced
a
young
peasant
shouted
to
the
wounded
man
hold
your
gab
or
i
kill
you
the
officer
tried
to
get
up
and
he
glared
at
the
man
who
had
just
spoken
to
him
with
eyes
swine
he
said
kill
me
they
cut
your
heads
off
he
went
on
shouting
the
man
who
had
been
ripped
up
screamed
like
a
bleeding
pig
the
third
was
stiff
and
still
like
a
dead
man
a
crushing
terror
came
over
the
peasants
lorchen
and
some
women
carried
the
wounded
men
to
another
room
the
shouts
of
the
officer
and
the
screams
of
the
dying
man
died
away
the
peasants
were
silent
they
stood
fixed
in
the
circle
as
though
the
three
bodies
were
still
lying
at
their
feet
they
dared
not
budge
and
looked
at
each
other
in
panic
at
last
lorchen
father
said
you
have
done
a
fine
piece
of
work
there
was
an
agonized
murmuring
their
throats
were
dry
then
they
began
all
to
talk
at
once
at
first
they
whispered
as
though
they
were
afraid
of
eavesdroppers
but
soon
they
raised
their
voices
and
became
more
vehement
they
accused
each
other
they
blamed
each
other
for
the
blows
they
had
struck
the
dispute
became
acrid
they
seemed
to
be
on
the
point
of
going
for
each
other
lorchen
father
brought
them
to
unanimity
with
his
arms
folded
he
turned
towards
christophe
and
jerked
his
chin
at
him
and
he
said
what
business
had
this
fellow
here
the
wrath
of
the
rabble
was
turned
on
christophe
true
true
they
cried
he
began
it
but
for
him
nothing
would
have
happened
christophe
was
amazed
he
tried
to
reply
you
know
perfectly
that
what
i
did
was
for
you
not
for
myself
but
they
replied
furiously
are
we
capable
of
defending
ourselves
do
you
think
we
need
a
gentleman
from
the
town
to
tell
us
what
we
should
do
who
asked
your
advice
and
besides
who
asked
you
to
come
could
you
stay
at
home
christophe
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
turned
towards
the
door
but
lorchen
father
barred
the
way
screaming
that
it
that
it
he
shouted
he
would
like
to
cut
away
now
after
getting
us
all
into
a
scrape
he
sha
go
the
peasants
roared
he
sha
go
he
the
cause
of
it
all
he
shall
pay
for
it
all
they
surrounded
him
and
shook
their
fists
at
him
christophe
saw
the
circle
of
threatening
faces
closing
in
upon
him
fear
had
infuriated
them
he
said
nothing
made
a
face
of
disgust
threw
his
hat
on
the
table
went
and
sat
at
the
end
of
the
room
and
turned
his
back
on
them
but
lorchen
was
angry
and
flung
herself
at
the
peasants
her
pretty
face
was
red
and
scowling
with
rage
she
pushed
back
the
people
who
were
crowding
round
christophe
cowards
brute
beasts
she
cried
are
you
ashamed
you
want
to
pretend
that
he
brought
it
all
on
you
as
if
they
did
not
see
you
all
as
if
there
was
a
single
one
of
you
who
had
not
hit
out
his
hand
as
he
could
if
there
had
been
a
man
who
had
stayed
with
his
arms
folded
while
the
others
were
fighting
i
would
spit
in
his
face
and
call
him
coward
coward
the
peasants
surprised
by
this
unexpected
outburst
stayed
for
a
moment
in
silence
they
began
to
shout
again
he
began
it
nothing
would
have
happened
but
for
him
in
vain
did
lorchen
father
make
signs
to
his
daughter
she
went
on
yes
he
did
begin
it
that
is
nothing
for
you
to
boast
about
but
for
him
you
would
have
let
them
insult
you
you
would
have
let
them
insult
you
you
cowards
you
funks
she
abused
her
partner
and
you
you
said
nothing
your
heart
was
in
your
mouth
you
held
out
your
bottom
to
be
kicked
you
would
have
thanked
them
for
it
are
you
ashamed
are
you
all
ashamed
you
are
not
men
you
as
brave
as
sheep
with
your
noses
to
the
ground
all
the
time
he
had
to
give
you
an
example
and
now
you
want
to
make
him
bear
everything
well
i
tell
you
that
sha
happen
he
fought
for
us
either
you
save
him
or
suffer
along
with
him
i
give
you
my
word
for
it
lorchen
father
caught
her
arm
he
was
beside
himself
and
shouted
shut
up
shut
up
will
you
shut
up
you
bitch
but
she
thrust
him
away
and
went
on
again
the
peasants
yelled
she
shouted
louder
than
they
in
a
shrill
piercing
scream
what
have
you
to
say
to
it
all
do
you
think
i
did
not
see
you
just
now
kicking
the
man
who
is
lying
half
dead
in
the
next
room
and
you
show
me
your
hands
there
blood
on
them
do
you
think
i
did
not
see
you
with
your
knife
i
shall
tell
everything
i
saw
if
you
do
the
least
thing
against
him
i
will
have
you
all
condemned
the
infuriated
peasants
thrust
their
faces
into
lorchen
and
bawled
at
her
one
of
them
made
as
though
to
box
her
ears
but
lorchen
lover
seized
him
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
they
jostled
each
other
and
were
on
the
point
of
coming
to
blows
an
old
man
said
to
lorchen
if
we
are
condemned
you
will
be
too
i
shall
be
too
she
said
i
am
not
so
cowardly
as
you
and
she
burst
out
again
they
did
not
know
what
to
do
they
turned
to
her
father
ca
you
make
her
be
silent
the
old
man
had
understood
that
it
was
not
wise
to
push
lorchen
too
far
he
signed
to
them
to
be
calm
silence
came
lorchen
went
on
talking
alone
then
as
she
found
no
response
like
a
fire
without
fuel
she
stopped
after
a
moment
her
father
coughed
and
said
well
then
what
do
you
want
you
do
want
to
ruin
us
she
said
i
want
him
to
be
saved
they
began
to
think
christophe
had
not
moved
from
where
he
sat
he
was
stiff
and
proud
and
seemed
not
to
understand
that
they
were
discussing
him
but
he
was
touched
by
lorchen
intervention
lorchen
seemed
not
to
be
aware
of
his
presence
she
was
leaning
against
the
table
by
which
he
was
sitting
and
glaring
defiantly
at
the
peasants
who
were
smoking
and
looking
down
at
the
ground
at
last
her
father
chewed
his
pipe
for
a
little
and
said
whether
we
say
anything
or
not
if
he
stays
he
is
done
for
the
sergeant
major
recognized
him
he
wo
spare
him
there
is
only
one
thing
for
him
to
do
to
get
away
at
once
to
the
other
side
of
the
frontier
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
it
would
be
better
for
them
all
if
christophe
escaped
in
that
way
he
would
admit
his
guilt
and
when
he
was
no
longer
there
to
defend
himself
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
put
upon
him
the
burden
of
the
affair
the
others
agreed
they
understood
each
other
now
that
they
had
come
to
a
decision
they
were
all
in
a
hurry
for
christophe
to
go
without
being
in
the
least
embarrassed
by
what
they
had
been
saying
a
moment
before
they
came
up
to
him
and
pretended
to
be
deeply
interested
in
his
welfare
there
is
not
a
moment
to
lose
sir
said
lorchen
father
they
will
come
back
half
an
hour
to
go
to
the
fortress
half
an
hour
to
come
back
there
is
only
just
time
to
slip
away
christophe
had
risen
he
too
had
been
thinking
he
knew
that
if
he
stayed
he
was
lost
but
to
go
to
go
without
seeing
his
mother
no
it
was
impossible
he
said
that
he
would
first
go
back
to
the
town
and
would
still
have
time
to
go
during
the
night
and
cross
the
frontier
but
they
protested
loudly
they
had
barred
the
door
just
before
to
prevent
his
going
now
they
wanted
to
prevent
his
not
going
if
he
went
back
to
the
town
he
was
certain
to
be
caught
they
would
know
at
the
fortress
before
he
got
there
they
would
await
him
at
he
insisted
lorchen
had
understood
him
you
want
to
see
your
mother
i
will
go
instead
of
you
when
really
you
will
do
that
i
will
go
she
took
her
shawl
and
put
it
round
her
head
write
a
letter
i
will
take
it
to
her
come
with
me
i
will
give
you
some
ink
she
took
him
into
the
inner
room
at
the
door
she
turned
and
addressing
her
lover
and
do
you
get
ready
she
said
you
must
take
him
you
must
not
leave
him
until
you
have
seen
him
over
the
frontier
he
was
as
eager
as
anybody
to
see
christophe
over
into
france
and
farther
if
possible
lorchen
went
into
the
next
room
with
christophe
he
was
still
hesitating
he
was
torn
by
grief
at
the
thought
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
embrace
his
mother
when
would
he
see
her
again
she
was
so
old
so
worn
out
so
lonely
this
fresh
blow
would
be
too
much
for
her
what
would
become
of
her
without
him
but
what
would
become
of
him
if
he
stayed
and
were
condemned
and
put
in
prison
for
years
would
not
that
even
more
certainly
mean
destitution
and
misery
for
her
if
he
were
free
though
far
away
he
could
always
help
her
or
she
could
come
to
he
had
not
time
to
see
clearly
in
his
mind
lorchen
took
his
hands
she
stood
near
him
and
looked
at
him
their
faces
were
almost
touching
she
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
kissed
his
mouth
quick
quick
she
whispered
pointing
to
the
table
he
gave
up
trying
to
think
he
sat
down
she
tore
a
sheet
of
squared
paper
with
red
lines
from
an
account
book
he
wrote

dear
mother

said
lorchen
swain
pushing
the
door
open
christophe
wrote
his
name
hurriedly
and
gave
the
letter
to
lorchen
you
will
give
it
to
her
yourself

am
going
she
said
she
was
already

on
i
will
bring

her
reply
you
must
wait
for
me
at
leiden
the
first
station
beyond
the
german
frontier
on
the
platform
she
had
read
christophe
letter
over
his
shoulder
as
he
wrote
you

tell
me
everything
and
how
she
bore
the
blow
and
everything
she
says
to
you
you
will
not
keep
anything
from
me
said
christophe
beseechingly
i
will
tell
you
everything
they
were
not
so
free
to
talk
now
for
the
young
man
was
at
the
door
watching
them
and
then
herr
christophe
said
lorchen
i
will
go
and
see
her
sometimes
and
i
will
send
you
news
of
her
do
not
be
anxious
she
shook
hands
with
him
vigorously
like
a
man
let
us
go
said
the
peasant
let
us
go
said
christophe
all
three
went
out
on
the
road
they
parted
lorchen
went
one
way
and
christophe
with
his
guide
the
other
they
did
not
speak
the
crescent
moon
veiled
in
mists
was
disappearing
behind
the
woods
a
pale
light
hovered
over
the
fields
in
the
hollows
the
mists
had
risen
thick
and
milky
white
the
shivering
trees
were
bathed
in
the
moisture
of
the
they
were
not
more
than
a
few
minutes
gone
from
the
village
when
the
peasant
flung
back
sharply
and
signed
to
christophe
to
stop
they
listened
on
the
road
in
front
of
them
they
heard
the
regular
tramp
of
a
troop
of
soldiers
coming
towards
them
the
peasant
climbed
the
hedge
into
the
fields
christophe
followed
him
they
walked
away
across
the
plowed
fields
they
heard
the
soldiers
go
by
on
the
road
in
the
darkness
the
peasant
shook
his
fist
at
them
christophe
heart
stopped
like
a
hunted
animal
that
hears
the
baying
of
the
hounds
they
returned
to
the
road
again
avoiding
the
villages
and
isolated
farms
where
the
barking
of
the
dogs
betrayed
them
to
the
countryside
on
the
slope
of
a
wooded
hill
they
saw
in
the
distance
the
red
lights
of
the
railway
they
took
the
direction
of
the
signals
and
decided
to
go
to
the
first
station
it
was
not
easy
as
they
came
down
into
the
valley
they
plunged
into
the
fog
they
had
to
jump
a
few
streams
soon
they
found
themselves
in
immense
fields
of
beetroot
and
plowed
land
they
thought
they
would
never
be
through
the
plain
was
uneven
there
were
little
rises
and
hollows
into
which
they
were
always
in
danger
of
falling
at
last
after
walking
blindly
through
the
fog
they
saw
suddenly
a
few
yards
away
the
signal
light
of
the
railway
at
the
top
of
an
embankment
they
climbed
the
bank
at
the
risk
of
being
run
over
they
followed
the
rails
until
they
were
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
station
then
they
took
to
the
road
again
they
reached
the
station
twenty
minutes
before
the
train
went
in
spite
of
lorchen
orders
the
peasant
left
christophe
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
go
back
to
see
what
had
happened
to
the
others
and
to
his
own
property
christophe
took
a
ticket
for
leiden
and
waited
alone
in
the
empty
waiting
room
an
official
who
was
asleep
on
a
seat
came
and
looked
at
christophe
ticket
and
opened
the
door
for
him
when
the
train
came
in
there
was
nobody
in
the
carriage
everybody
in
the
train
was
asleep
in
the
fields
all
was
asleep
only
christophe
did
not
sleep
in
spite
of
his
weariness
as
the
heavy
iron
wheels
approached
the
frontier
he
felt
a
fearful
longing
to
be
out
of
reach
in
an
hour
he
would
be
free
but
till
then
a
word
would
be
enough
to
have
him
arrested
arrested
his
whole
being
revolted
at
the
word
to
be
stifled
by
odious
force
he
could
not
breathe
his
mother
his
country
that
he
was
leaving
were
no
longer
in
his
thoughts
in
the
egoism
of
his
threatened
liberty
he
thought
only
of
that
liberty
of
his
life
which
he
wished
to
save
whatever
it
might
cost
even
at
the
cost
of
crime
he
was
bitterly
sorry
that
he
had
taken
the
train
instead
of
continuing
the
journey
to
the
frontier
on
foot
he
had
wanted
to
gain
a
few
hours
a
fine
gain
he
was
throwing
himself
into
the
jaws
of
the
wolf
surely
they
were
waiting
for
him
at
the
frontier
station
orders
must
have
been
given
he
would
be
arrested
he
thought
for
a
moment
of
leaving
the
train
while
it
was
moving
before
it
reached
the
station
he
even
opened
the
door
of
the
carriage
but
it
was
too
late
the
train
was
at
the
station
it
stopped
fire
minutes
an
eternity
christophe
withdrew
to
the
end
of
the
compartment
and
hid
behind
the
curtain
and
anxiously
watched
the
platform
on
which
a
gendarme
was
standing
motionless
the
station
master
came
out
of
his
office
with
a
telegram
in
his
hand
and
went
hurriedly
up
to
the
gendarme
christophe
had
no
doubt
that
it
was
about
himself
he
looked
for
a
weapon
he
had
only
a
strong
knife
with
two
blades
he
opened
it
in
his
pocket
an
official
with
a
lamp
on
his
chest
had
passed
the
station
master
and
was
running
along
the
train
christophe
saw
him
coming
his
fist
closed
on
the
handle
of
the
knife
in
his
pocket
and
he
thought
i
am
lost
he
was
in
such
a
state
of
excitement
that
he
would
have
been
capable
of
plunging
the
knife
into
the
man
breast
if
he
had
been
unfortunate
enough
to
come
straight
to
him
and
open
his
compartment
but
the
official
stopped
at
the
next
carriage
to
look
at
the
ticket
of
a
passenger
who
had
just
taken
his
seat
the
train
moved
on
again
christophe
repressed
the
throbbing
of
his
heart
he
did
not
stir
he
dared
hardly
say
to
himself
that
he
was
saved
he
would
not
say
it
until
he
had
crossed
the
frontier
day
was
beginning
to
dawn
the
silhouettes
of
the
trees
were
starting
out
of
the
night
a
carriage
was
passing
on
the
road
like
a
fantastic
shadow
with
a
jingle
of
bells
and
a
winking
eye
with
his
face
close
pressed
to
the
window
christophe
tried
to
see
the
post
with
the
imperial
arms
which
marked
the
bounds
of
his
servitude
he
was
still
looking
for
it
in
the
growing
light
when
the
train
whistled
to
announce
its
arrival
at
the
first
belgian
station
he
got
up
opened
the
door
wide
and
drank
in
the
icy
air
free
his
whole
life
before
him
the
joy
of
life
and
at
once
there
came
upon
him
suddenly
all
the
sadness
of
what
he
was
leaving
all
the
sadness
of
what
he
was
going
to
meet
and
he
was
overwhelmed
by
the
fatigue
of
that
night
of
emotion
he
sank
down
on
the
seat
he
had
hardly
been
in
the
station
a
minute
when
a
minute
later
an
official
opened
the
door
of
the
carriage
he
found
christophe
asleep
christophe
awoke
dazed
thinking
he
had
been
asleep
an
hour
he
got
out
heavily
and
dragged
himself
to
the
customs
and
when
he
was
definitely
accepted
on
foreign
territory
having
no
more
to
defend
himself
he
lay
down
along
a
seat
in
the
waiting
room
and
dropped
off
and
slept
like
a
log
he
awoke
about
noon
lorchen
could
hardly
come
before
two
or
three
while
he
was
waiting
for
the
trains
he
walked
up
and
down
the
platform
of
the
little
station
then
he
went
straight
on
into
the
middle
of
the
fields
it
was
a
gray
and
joyless
day
giving
warning
of
the
approach
of
winter
the
light
was
dim
the
plaintive
whistle
of
a
train
stopping
was
all
that
broke
the
melancholy
silence
christophe
stopped
a
few
yards
away
from
the
frontier
in
the
deserted
country
before
him
was
a
little
pond
a
clear
pool
of
water
in
which
the
gloomy
sky
was
reflected
it
was
inclosed
by
a
fence
and
two
trees
grew
by
its
side
on
the
right
a
poplar
with
leafless
trembling
top
behind
a
great
walnut
tree
with
black
naked
branches
like
a
monstrous
polypus
the
black
fruit
of
it
swung
heavily
on
it
the
last
withered
leaves
were
decaying
and
falling
one
by
one
upon
the
still
pond
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
already
seen
them
the
two
trees
the
pond
and
suddenly
he
had
one
of
those
moments
of
giddiness
which
open
great
distances
in
the
plain
of
life
a
chasm
in
time
he
knew
not
where
he
was
who
he
was
in
what
age
he
lived
through
how
many
ages
he
had
been
so
christophe
had
a
feeling
that
it
had
already
been
that
what
was
now
was
not
now
but
in
some
other
time
he
was
no
longer
himself
he
was
able
to
see
himself
from
outside
from
a
great
distance
as
though
it
were
some
one
else
standing
there
in
that
place
he
heard
the
buzzing
of
memory
and
of
an
unknown
creature
within
himself
the
blood
boiled
in
his
veins
and
roared
thus
thus
thus
the
centuries
whirled
through
him
many
other
kraffts
had
passed
through
the
experiences
which
were
his
on
that
day
and
had
tasted
the
wretchedness
of
the
last
hour
on
their
native
soil
a
wandering
race
banished
everywhere
for
their
independence
and
disturbing
qualities
a
race
always
the
prey
of
an
inner
demon
that
never
let
it
settle
anywhere
a
race
attached
to
the
soil
from
which
it
was
torn
and
never
never
ceasing
to
love
it
christophe
in
his
turn
was
passing
through
these
same
sorrowful
experiences
and
he
was
finding
on
the
way
the
footsteps
of
those
who
had
gone
before
him
with
tears
in
his
eyes
he
watched
his
native
land
disappear
in
the
mist
his
country
to
which
he
had
to
say
had
he
not
ardently
desired
to
leave
it
yes
but
now
that
he
was
actually
leaving
it
he
felt
himself
racked
by
anguish
only
a
brutish
heart
can
part
without
emotion
from
the
motherland
happy
or
unhappy
he
had
lived
with
her
she
was
his
mother
and
his
comrade
he
had
slept
in
her
he
had
slept
on
her
bosom
he
was
impregnated
with
her
in
her
bosom
she
held
the
treasure
of
his
dreams
all
his
past
life
the
sacred
dust
of
those
whom
he
had
loved
christophe
saw
now
in
review
the
days
of
his
life
and
the
dear
men
and
women
whom
he
was
leaving
on
that
soil
or
beneath
it
his
sufferings
were
not
less
dear
to
him
than
his
joys
minna
sabine
ada
his
grandfather
uncle
gottfried
old
schulz
all
passed
before
him
in
the
space
of
a
few
minutes
he
could
not
tear
himself
away
from
the
dead
for
he
counted
ada
also
among
the
dead
the
idea
of
his
mother
whom
he
was
leaving
the
only
living
creature
of
all
those
whom
he
loved
among
these
phantoms
was
intolerable
to
him
he
was
almost
on
the
point
of
crossing
the
frontier
again
so
cowardly
did
his
flight
seem
to
him
he
made
up
his
mind
that
if
the
answer
lorchen
was
to
bring
him
from
his
mother
betrayed
too
great
grief
he
would
return
at
all
costs
but
if
he
received
nothing
if
lorchen
had
not
been
able
to
reach
louisa
or
to
bring
back
the
answer
well
he
would
go
back
he
returned
to
the
station
after
a
grim
time
of
waiting
the
train
at
last
appeared
christophe
expected
to
see
lorchen
bold
face
in
the
train
for
he
was
sure
she
would
keep
her
promise
but
she
did
not
appear
he
ran
anxiously
from
one
compartment
to
another
he
said
to
himself
that
if
she
had
been
in
the
train
she
would
have
been
one
of
the
first
to
get
out
as
he
was
plunging
through
the
stream
of
passengers
coming
from
the
opposite
direction
he
saw
a
face
which
he
seemed
to
know
it
was
the
face
of
a
little
girl
of
thirteen
or
fourteen
chubby
dimpled
and
ruddy
as
an
apple
with
a
little
nose
and
a
large
mouth
and
a
thick
plait
coiled
around
her
head
as
he
looked
more
closely
at
her
he
saw
that
she
had
in
her
hand
an
old
valise
very
much
like
his
own
she
was
watching
him
too
like
a
sparrow
and
when
she
saw
that
he
was
looking
at
her
she
came
towards
him
but
she
stood
firmly
in
front
of
christophe
and
stared
at
him
with
her
little
eyes
without
speaking
a
word
christophe
knew
her
she
was
a
little
milkmaid
at
lorchen
farm
pointing
to
the
valise
he
said
that
is
mine
is
it
the
girl
did
not
move
and
replied
cunningly
i
not
sure
where
do
you
come
from
first
of
all
buir
and
who
sent
it
you
lorchen
come
give
it
me
the
little
girl
held
out
the
valise
there
it
is
and
she
added
oh
but
i
knew
you
at
once
what
were
you
waiting
for
then
i
was
waiting
for
you
to
tell
me
that
it
was
you
and
lorchen
asked
christophe
why
did
she
come
the
girl
did
not
reply
christophe
understood
that
she
did
not
want
to
say
anything
among
all
the
people
they
had
first
to
pass
through
the
customs
when
that
was
done
christophe
took
the
girl
to
the
end
of
the
platform
the
police
came
said
the
girl
now
very
talkative
they
came
almost
as
soon
as
you
had
gone
they
went
into
all
the
houses
they
questioned
everybody
and
they
arrested
big
sami
and
christian
and
old
kaspar
and
also
mélanie
and
gertrude
though
they
declared
they
had
done
nothing
and
they
wept
and
gertrude
scratched
the
gendarmes
it
was
not
any
good
then
saying
that
you
had
done
it
all
i
exclaimed
christophe
oh
yes
said
the
girl
quietly
it
was
no
good
as
you
had
gone
then
they
looked
for
you
everywhere
and
hunted
for
you
in
every
direction
and
lorchen
lorchen
was
not
there
she
came
back
afterwards
after
she
had
been
to
the
town
did
she
see
my
mother
yes
here
is
the
letter
and
she
wanted
to
come
herself
but
she
was
arrested
too
how
did
you
manage
to
come
well
she
came
back
to
the
village
without
being
seen
by
the
police
and
she
was
going
to
set
out
again
but
irmina
gertrude
sister
denounced
her
they
came
to
arrest
her
then
when
she
saw
the
gendarmes
coming
she
went
up
to
her
room
and
shouted
that
she
would
come
down
in
a
minute
that
she
was
dressing
i
was
in
the
vineyard
behind
the
house
she
called
to
me
from
the
window
lydia
i
went
to
her
she
threw
down
your
valise
and
the
letter
which
your
mother
had
given
her
and
she
explained
where
i
should
find
you
i
ran
and
here
i
am
did
she
say
anything
more
yes
she
told
me
to
give
you
this
shawl
to
show
you
that
i
came
from
her
christophe
recognized
the
white
shawl
with
red
spots
and
embroidered
flowers
which
lorchen
had
tied
round
her
head
when
she
left
him
on
the
night
before
the
naïve
improbability
of
the
excuse
she
had
made
for
sending
him
such
a
did
not
make
him
smile
now
said
the
girl
here
is
the
return
train
i
must
go
home
wait
said
christophe
and
the
fare
what
did
you
do
about
that
lorchen
gave
it
me
take
this
said
christophe
pressing
a
few
pieces
of
money
into
her
hand
he
held
her
back
as
she
was
trying
to
go
and
then
he
said
he
stooped
and
kissed
her
cheeks
the
girl
affected
to
protest
do
mind
said
christophe
jokingly
it
was
not
for
you
oh
i
know
that
said
the
girl
mockingly
it
was
for
lorchen
it
was
not
only
lorchen
that
christophe
kissed
as
he
kissed
the
little
milkmaid
chubby
cheeks
it
was
all
germany
the
girl
slipped
away
and
ran
towards
the
train
which
was
just
going
she
hung
out
of
the
window
and
waved
her
handkerchief
to
him
until
she
was
out
of
sight
he
followed
with
his
eyes
the
rustic
messenger
who
had
brought
him
for
the
last
time
the
breath
of
his
country
and
of
those
he
loved
when
she
had
gone
he
found
himself
utterly
alone
this
time
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
he
had
in
his
hand
his
mother
letter
and
the
shawl
he
pressed
the
shawl
to
his
breast
and
tried
to
open
the
letter
but
his
hands
trembled
what
would
he
find
in
it
what
suffering
would
be
written
in
it
no
he
could
not
bear
the
sorrowful
words
of
reproach
which
already
he
seemed
to
hear
he
would
retrace
his
steps
at
last
he
unfolded
the
letter
and
read
my
poor
child
do
not
be
anxious
about
me
i
will
be
wise
god
has
punished
me
i
must
not
be
selfish
and
keep
you
here
go
to
paris
perhaps
it
will
be
better
for
you
do
not
worry
about
me
i
can
manage
somehow
the
chief
thing
is
that
you
should
be
happy
i
kiss
you
mother
write
to
me
when
you
can
christophe
sat
down
on
his
valise
and
wept
the
porter
was
shouting
the
train
for
paris
the
heavy
train
was
slowing
down
with
a
terrific
noise
christophe
dried
his
tears
got
up
and
said
i
must
go
he
looked
at
the
sky
in
the
direction
in
which
paris
must
be
the
sky
dark
everywhere
was
even
darker
there
it
was
like
a
dark
chasm
heart
ached
but
he
said
again
i
must
go
he
climbed
into
the
train
and
leaning
out
of
the
window
went
on
looking
at
the
menacing
horizon
o
paris
he
thought
paris
come
to
my
aid
save
me
save
my
thoughts
the
thick
fog
grew
denser
still
behind
christophe
above
the
country
he
was
leaving
a
little
patch
of
sky
pale
blue
large
like
two
eyes
like
the
eyes
of
sabine
smiled
sorrowfully
through
the
heavy
veil
of
clouds
and
then
was
gone
the
train
departed
rain
fell
night
fell
