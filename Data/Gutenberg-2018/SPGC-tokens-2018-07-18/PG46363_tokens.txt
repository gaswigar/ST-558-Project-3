a
dark
night
secret
a
night
of
storm
and
tempest
the
wind
blowing
a
perfect
gale
and
above
its
mad
shrieking
the
sullen
roar
of
the
ocean
as
it
beat
against
the
shore
in
angry
vehemence
recoiling
with
wrathful
force
as
though
to
gather
strength
for
a
fresh
onslaught
the
little
town
of
chester
massachusetts
near
the
beach
lay
wrapped
in
gloom
and
darkness
under
the
lowering
midnight
sky
while
the
rains
descended
and
the
floods
came
it
was
a
terrible
night
that
tenth
of
november
one
man
was
destined
to
remember
that
night
as
long
as
he
lived
alone
in
his
dingy
little
office
doctor
frederick
lynne
sat
absorbed
in
the
contents
of
a
medical
journal
his
grave
face
bent
over
the
printed
page
upon
which
his
eyes
were
fixed
with
eager
interest
while
the
moments
came
and
went
unnoticed
he
closed
the
journal
at
last
with
an
impatient
gesture
and
pushed
it
aside
arising
slowly
to
his
feet
a
tall
dark
elderly
man
with
a
troubled
anxious
expression
he
went
slowly
over
to
the
bright
which
burned
upon
the
broad
hearth
and
stood
gazing
down
into
the
bed
of
rosy
coals
the
anxious
look
deepening
in
his
eyes
a
poor
country
physician
with
a
wife
and
child
depending
upon
his
exertions
he
found
the
struggle
for
subsistence
growing
harder
every
day
ugh
what
a
night
he
muttered
i
dread
to
start
for
home
i
believe
i
will
wait
until
the
storm
subsides
a
little
clasping
his
hands
behind
his
head
with
a
weary
little
gesture
if
only
the
struggle
were
not
quite
so
hard
so
desperate
if
only
i
need
not
slave
as
i
do
hard
work
and
poor
pay
it
is
enough
to
make
a
man
discouraged
especially
a
man
with
a
wife
like
mine
she
is
always
longing
and
wishing
for
fine
clothes
and
a
better
home
and
all
the
luxuries
that
only
money
can
supply
it
drives
me
nearly
mad
at
times
and
there
no
way
of
escape
only
to
come
down
here
to
the
office
and
lock
myself
in
heavens
i
wish
that
i
were
rich
i
would
do
almost
anything
in
the
world
for
money
anything
tap
tap
tap
at
the
outer
door
of
the
office
the
entire
building
consisted
of
two
rooms
a
private
and
the
office
proper
which
opened
out
upon
the
long
straight
village
street
with
its
stores
and
the
great
bare
unpainted
hotel
which
seemed
perennially
empty
at
sound
of
that
unexpected
summons
doctor
lynne
started
in
surprise
for
five
long
years
he
had
occupied
that
office
whose
shingle
told
the
that
frederick
lynne
might
be
found
within
but
never
before
within
memory
had
he
been
summoned
upon
a
night
like
this
sickness
was
at
a
discount
in
healthy
chester
where
people
usually
died
of
old
age
but
as
he
stood
there
staring
vacantly
about
him
trying
to
persuade
himself
that
it
had
been
only
a
freak
of
the
imagination
once
more
that
ghostly
tapping
sounded
upon
the
stout
oaken
panels
of
the
office
door
it
some
one
ejaculated
the
astonished
physician
going
swiftly
to
the
door
and
unbolting
it
you
better
be
all
night
about
it
growled
a
voice
from
the
and
lynne
saw
before
him
a
tall
man
wrapped
in
a
long
dark
cloak
the
high
collar
turned
up
about
his
ears
a
sombrero
pulled
down
over
his
brows
so
that
no
feature
of
the
face
was
visible
save
a
pair
of
flashing
dark
eyes
and
a
prominent
nose
doctor
lynne
i
presume
queried
the
stranger
the
physician
bowed
i
am
doctor
lynne
sir
he
returned
simply
are
my
services
required
yes
wait
a
moment
the
physician
stood
there
in
the
open
door
through
which
the
wind
swept
madly
nearly
extinguishing
the
dim
light
of
the
little
oil
lamp
upon
the
his
astonished
eyes
fixed
upon
an
unwonted
spectacle
a
closed
carriage
which
stood
without
its
driver
enveloped
in
an
coat
sitting
like
a
statue
upon
the
box
the
stranger
walked
swiftly
to
the
carriage
door
and
opened
it
a
pause
ensued
during
which
doctor
lynne
began
to
feel
strangely
uncomfortable
then
to
his
relief
the
stranger
reappeared
at
the
office
door
bearing
in
his
arms
the
slight
figure
of
a
woman
have
you
any
brandy
or
other
stimulant
he
asked
as
he
placed
the
limp
unresisting
figure
upon
the
sofa
which
stood
in
a
corner
certainly
shall
i
administer
some
the
lady
is
ill
very
will
you
kindly
take
charge
of
her
while
i
go
to
the
hotel
and
make
arrangements
for
our
reception
there
this
lady
is
my
wife
she
was
taken
suddenly
ill
on
the
road
and
i
am
a
stranger
here
doctor
lynne
was
hurriedly
searching
the
corner
cupboard
for
brandy
and
other
restoratives
i
will
do
all
in
my
power
certainly
he
returned
have
you
come
far
he
turned
swiftly
as
he
spoke
and
found
that
the
stranger
had
disappeared
the
physician
rushed
to
the
door
and
peered
out
into
the
night
and
storm
the
carriage
had
disappeared
also
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
a
strange
oppression
settled
slowly
down
upon
doctor
spirits
he
closed
the
door
and
went
back
to
the
fire
the
silent
figure
upon
the
sofa
had
neither
moved
nor
stirred
the
face
was
hidden
from
view
by
a
thick
veil
but
as
the
doctor
paused
before
the
fire
to
measure
some
brandy
into
the
glass
in
his
hand
the
silence
of
the
room
was
broken
by
an
unexpected
sound
cry
of
a
little
with
a
start
of
surprise
doctor
lynne
hastened
to
the
sofa
and
saw
for
the
first
time
that
the
sick
woman
held
a
child
in
her
arms
he
stooped
and
attempted
to
remove
it
a
lovely
smiling
little
creature
of
some
nine
or
ten
months
allow
me
madame
he
began
gently
the
babe
is
too
heavy
and
you
are
what
is
the
trouble
no
answer
no
sound
to
break
the
silence
of
the
stormy
night
only
off
in
the
distance
the
shriek
of
an
engine
as
the
down
express
having
halted
as
usual
at
the
station
the
brief
pause
which
was
considered
long
enough
for
a
place
like
chester
dashed
madly
on
its
way
once
more
doctor
lynne
eyes
sought
the
silent
recumbent
form
of
the
woman
and
something
in
her
attitude
and
the
strange
and
inexplicable
silence
that
she
maintained
struck
to
his
heart
with
an
uneasy
sensation
madame
he
repeated
venturing
to
lay
his
hand
upon
her
shoulder
you
are
ill
suffering
tell
me
where
is
the
pain
no
answer
something
in
that
awful
silence
made
his
heart
grow
faint
and
cold
he
lifted
his
hand
and
swiftly
reverently
removed
the
veil
from
the
woman
face
with
a
cry
of
horror
he
recoiled
from
the
sight
the
woman
was
dead
and
cold
and
had
been
for
hours
he
rushed
to
the
door
and
opening
it
glared
wildly
out
into
the
night
and
darkness
there
was
no
sign
of
any
living
creature
doctor
lynne
closed
the
door
once
more
and
went
back
to
the
silent
figure
upon
the
sofa
the
face
before
him
was
very
beautiful
a
woman
of
some
years
the
body
was
attired
in
handsome
garments
and
one
hand
a
beautiful
white
hand
with
a
plain
gold
ring
upon
the
third
finger
grasped
even
in
death
a
tiny
vial
the
vial
was
empty
but
it
bore
the
hideous
skull
and
crossbones
together
with
the
significant
legend
laudanum
poison
clasped
in
the
arms
lay
the
child
a
lovely
little
girl
while
pinned
to
its
dainty
white
slip
was
a
folded
paper
addressed
to
doctor
frederick
lynne
bewildered
at
the
strange
occurrences
the
physician
hurriedly
opened
the
folded
paper
and
read
these
words
doctor
frederick
lynne
you
have
wished
many
a
time
for
wealth
the
chance
to
acquire
a
competence
is
now
in
your
grasp
keep
this
child
and
rear
it
as
your
own
and
every
year
a
sum
of
money
sufficient
for
her
support
and
that
of
your
entire
family
shall
be
forwarded
to
you
on
condition
that
you
make
no
effort
to
discover
the
child
parents
or
antecedents
should
you
attempt
such
a
discovery
the
remittance
will
cease
but
remember
this
she
is
of
good
family
and
legitimate
you
may
call
her
accompanying
the
letter
was
a
crisp
one
bill
this
was
all
but
surely
it
was
enough
to
make
the
worthy
physician
stare
in
surprise
inquiry
the
next
morning
elicited
the
information
that
a
strange
man
had
suddenly
appeared
at
the
station
the
night
previous
and
boarded
the
down
express
the
carriage
had
disappeared
as
mysteriously
as
it
had
come
no
one
knew
whither
the
whole
affair
was
shrouded
in
mystery
the
coroner
inquest
resulted
in
the
verdict
of
death
from
laudanum
administered
by
some
person
unknown
the
body
was
buried
away
in
the
village
and
doctor
lynne
took
the
infant
to
his
humble
home
it
was
received
unwillingly
enough
by
lynne
a
woman
who
ruled
her
husband
and
household
with
a
rod
of
iron
but
for
the
sake
of
the
money
she
consented
reluctantly
to
receive
the
child
and
so
beatrix
dane
grew
up
to
womanhood
but
before
she
reached
her
seventeenth
year
the
remittances
ceased
and
the
black
shadow
of
poverty
brooded
over
the
cheerless
home
of
the
lynnes
troubles
never
come
singly
so
just
at
this
juncture
doctor
lynne
was
stricken
with
partial
paralysis
of
the
limbs
which
would
render
him
an
invalid
for
life
all
the
future
looked
gloomy
and
threatening
and
the
gaunt
wolf
hovered
at
the
door
of
the
humble
home
chapter
ii
her
fairy
prince
any
letters
mr
grey
the
voice
was
low
and
eager
the
girl
to
whom
the
voice
belonged
paused
before
the
dingy
counter
of
the
country
store
and
combined
and
stood
patiently
waiting
the
postmaster
a
old
gentleman
with
a
superabundance
of
bald
head
glanced
over
the
meager
assortment
of
epistolary
communications
in
the
little
lettered
boxes
before
him
and
shook
his
head
slowly
no
oh
yes
to
be
sure
wait
a
moment
if
you
please
miss
beatrix
he
corrected
himself
pouncing
upon
a
large
white
envelope
which
he
placed
upon
the
counter
before
her
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
here

i
nigh
overlooked

and
i
never
heerd
him

south
how
your
ma
miss
beatrix
the
girl
dark
eyes
flashed
my
mother
she
repeated
with
a
little
tinge
of
contempt
in
her
sweet
voice
you

lynne

will
please

grey
that
although

but

nigh

he
added
anxiously
as
having
slipped
the
letter
into
her
pocket
the
girl
was
about
to
move
away
no
yes
there
is
you
may
cut
me
off
fifteen
yards
of
that
garnet
merino
if

miss
beatrix
measuring
off
the
soft
folds
of
merino
with
deft
fingers
you
do
to
like
lynne
waal
in
natur
for
a
gal
to
keer
as
much
for
a
mother
as
she
would
for
her
own
your
mother
no
one
here
knows
who
she
was
miss
trix
but
when
i
looked
upon
her
dead
face
i
declar
i
thought
i
was
at
the
face
o
an
angel
the
girl
dark
eyes
filled
with
tears
but
she
choked
them
bravely
back
we
will
not
speak
of
her
now
if
you
please
grey
she
suggested
and
really
i
must
make
haste
home
for
it
is
getting
late
grey
took
off
his
huge
spectacles
and
rubbed
them
vigorously
upon
his
sleeve
to
be
sure
the
days
is
gettin
shorter
for
a
fact
november
is
a
dreary
month
hereabouts
and
upon
my
word
miss
trix
i
really
believe
it
goin
to
snow
and
you
have
two
good
miles
to
walk
yes
sir
i
know
i
would
have
come
earlier
but
lynne
objected
and
of
course
i
dared
not
disobey
then
papa
glanced
up
from
his
books
since
his
affliction
all
he
can
do
is
to
read
and
write
you
know
he
glanced
up
from
his
books
long
enough
to
see
that
i
was
really
anxious
to
go
and
then
he
happened
to
remember
that
we
had
not
heard
from
the
in
three
days
three
whole
days
and
so
he
gave
me
permission
but
i
must
make
haste
for
it
is
five
and
it
will
be
dark
before
six
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
miss
beatrix
my
dear
i
hope
you
reach
home
all
right
thank
you
nothing
will
harm
me
i
am
sure
the
door
of
the
old
building
opened
and
closed
behind
her
and
the
girl
stood
alone
under
the
gray
of
the
november
sky
a
slight
slim
figure
in
a
dowdyish
brown
serge
gown
and
a
hat
of
last
year
fashion
a
graceful
little
figure
with
a
face
of
rare
beauty
pale
colorless
complexion
with
straight
delicate
features
and
large
velvety
dark
eyes
and
a
mass
of
hair
beatrix
dane
was
well
worth
looking
at
as
she
stood
there
for
even
her
common
not
to
say
shabby
attire
did
not
conceal
the
exquisite
grace
and
beauty
of
her
face
and
form
for
a
moment
she
stood
gazing
about
her
then
with
a
low
sigh
she
hastened
away
two
weary
miles
lay
between
the
little
country
town
and
the
cheerless
home
of
doctor
lynne
whom
she
looked
upon
as
an
own
father
but
the
mistress
of
the
house
could
never
stand
in
the
place
of
a
mother
to
the
lonely
girl
she
was
thinking
of
it
now
as
she
hastened
over
the
hard
frozen
road
the
sun
sinking
slowly
out
of
sight
in
the
gloomy
west
a
light
fall
of
snow
beginning
slowly
to
descend
how
i
wish
i
were
rich
she
exclaimed
half
aloud
then
i
would
not
live
in
a
place
like
this
away
from
the
world
and
i
would
have
my
own
carriage
and
need
not
walk
it
must
be
delightful
to
have
all
the
money
you
wish
and
not
have
to
wear
the
same
old
gown
forever
a
dyed
old
gown
too
which
is
positively
hideous
she
drew
the
gayly
colored
plaid
shawl
that
she
wore
closer
about
her
shoulders
to
keep
out
the
chill
evening
air
and
she
shuddered
involuntarily
as
her
eyes
fell
upon
the
ugly
wrap
the
girl
was
an
artist
by
nature
and
anything
incongruous
or
out
of
harmony
jarred
upon
her
like
a
shock
while
any
unfortunate
mistake
in
the
blending
of
colors
would
send
a
chill
through
her
artistic
soul
oh
dear
i
wish
my
fairy
prince
would
come
she
cried
half
laughingly
and
rescue
me
from
my
unpleasant
surroundings
my
fairy
prince
like
the
princes
in
the
he
must
be
young
rich
and
handsome
courteous
and
and
everything
nice
he
must
be
tall
and
graceful
with
soft
dark
eyes
and
hair
as
black
as
midnight
a
sweet
mouth
but
firm
and
resolute
and
a
determined
chin
i
have
seen
a
picture
like
that
where
was
it
oh
yes
in
lynne
photograph
album
i
asked
her
who
it
was
and
she
told
me
that
it
was
no
concern
of
mine
to
be
sure
it
was
not
but
then
i
only
asked
a
civil
answer
to
a
harmless
question
ah
lynne
you
will
be
the
death
of
me
yet
you
and
your
ugly
daughter
serena
lynne
and
i
can
never
live
as
sisters
the
thought
of
it
makes
me
long
for
the
coming
of
my
prince
charming
who
will
take
me
away
to
peace
and
happiness
i
wish
my
own
father
would
come
for
me
i
wish
my
own
mother
had
not
died
i
i
good
gracious
is
she
came
to
a
frightened
halt
gazing
about
her
with
eyes
a
few
rods
before
her
a
little
river
remained
to
be
crossed
a
narrow
stream
but
very
deep
and
with
a
very
rapid
current
spanning
the
stream
was
a
dilapidated
bridge
which
had
already
been
condemned
for
the
use
of
vehicles
but
still
a
few
venturesome
pedestrians
trusted
their
lives
upon
its
frail
strength
beatrix
had
crossed
upon
the
bridge
she
had
fully
expected
to
return
in
that
way
but
now
as
she
came
to
a
frightened
halt
the
sound
of
a
horse
feet
broke
the
silence
and
she
beheld
an
unexpected
scene
just
before
her
over
the
bridge
she
saw
a
big
black
horse
and
upon
his
back
a
man
a
young
man
a
stranger
in
that
vicinity
he
was
crossing
the
dilapidated
structure
without
a
suspicion
that
it
was
unsafe
even
as
the
eyes
fell
upon
the
scene
went
the
rotten
timbers
there
was
a
wild
cry
a
rush
through
space
then
the
thud
of
a
falling
body
as
man
and
horse
struck
the
current
below
the
horse
once
freed
from
its
rider
swam
swiftly
toward
the
shore
and
reached
the
opposite
bank
up
which
it
scrambled
and
soon
disappeared
pale
and
trembling
the
girl
crept
close
to
the
and
glanced
over
she
could
see
that
tall
dark
form
battling
manfully
with
the
waves
the
river
was
deepest
and
swiftest
at
this
point
the
water
if
the
swimmer
was
able
to
keep
up
for
a
time
he
must
soon
succumb
to
the
cold
element
she
stood
transfixed
with
horror
her
eyes
riveted
upon
the
dark
figure
rising
and
falling
with
the
current
as
he
strove
to
keep
himself
afloat
and
made
a
desperate
fight
for
life
heaven
have
mercy
cried
the
girl
must
he
die
there
alone
oh
what
shall
i
do
what
can
i
do
there
was
no
one
within
a
mile
of
the
spot
long
before
she
could
summon
help
he
would
have
sunk
to
the
bottom
chilled
through
and
through
how
could
he
long
persist
in
his
mad
efforts
to
save
himself
all
at
once
an
inspiration
rushed
into
the
girl
heart
a
slim
chance
but
it
seemed
the
only
one
fortunately
the
stream
though
so
deep
and
swift
was
not
wide
her
plan
seemed
feasible
removing
the
long
stout
shawl
from
her
shivering
shoulders
she
crept
to
the
very
edge
of
the
bank
and
leaned
over
the
swimmer
was
nearly
paralyzed
from
the
cold
and
was
fast
giving
up
but
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
girl
and
he
saw
at
once
what
she
was
trying
to
do
can
you
swim
near
enough
to
reach
it
she
called
aloud
for
answer
he
made
one
more
desperate
effort
then
she
saw
for
the
first
time
that
he
had
been
injured
in
some
way
by
the
falling
timbers
one
of
his
limbs
seemed
nearly
useless
but
with
superhuman
efforts
he
strove
to
swim
within
reach
of
that
bright
colored
banner
streaming
out
upon
the
water
a
little
nearer
a
little
nearer
he
was
faint
and
chilled
to
the
bone
she
leaned
far
over
the
brink
of
the
stream
her
teeth
set
hard
together
her
eyes
flashing
with
resolution
try
she
cried
once
more
in
her
clear
cheery
voice
do
give
up
yet
try
one
more
desperate
plunge
and
he
had
caught
the
strong
woolen
fabric
in
both
chilled
numb
hands
could
she
tow
him
to
shore
would
she
have
strength
that
frail
slight
creature
she
stepped
slowly
backward
and
with
all
her
might
pulled
upon
the
impromptu
rope
moments
passed
which
seemed
hours
to
beatrix
dane
but
she
did
not
give
up
her
face
was
set
and
pale
the
little
white
teeth
shut
closely
down
upon
her
under
lip
her
hands
grasped
the
shawl
with
a
strength
born
of
desperation
and
so
at
last
the
deed
was
done
the
body
of
the
man
for
he
was
quite
unconscious
now
was
dragged
to
shore
and
beatrix
dane
stooped
and
gazed
into
the
still
white
face
she
fell
back
with
a
cry
of
astonishment
it
was
the
face
of
her
dreams
her
imaginary
hero
her
fairy
prince
his
eyes
were
closed
but
there
was
the
hair
as
black
as
midnight
the
straight
delicate
features
the
small
firm
mouth
half
hidden
by
the
silky
black
mustache
the
graceful
figure
he
was
all
that
her
fancy
had
painted
he
was
a
facsimile
of
the
picture
that
had
pleased
her
so
she
gazed
upon
the
still
white
face
and
her
heart
thrilled
with
a
strange
and
unaccountable
feeling
a
subtle
happiness
seemed
to
pervade
her
being
how
handsome
he
is
she
exclaimed
and
oh
what
can
i
do
to
restore
him
to
consciousness
poor
fellow
he
will
freeze
the
cold
chilly
winds
of
november
were
straying
about
through
the
bare
bleak
they
swept
over
the
drenched
form
lying
upon
the
cold
ground
and
beatrix
heart
grew
chill
as
a
horrible
fear
assailed
her
that
he
would
soon
be
frozen
to
death
his
clothing
was
literally
freezing
upon
his
body
her
shawl
the
only
warm
garment
which
she
possessed
was
dripping
with
water
she
wrung
out
its
folds
as
well
as
she
could
and
hung
it
upon
a
neighboring
bush
to
dry
then
she
glanced
around
her
she
must
find
some
way
to
warm
him
or
he
would
perish
there
before
her
her
eyes
fell
upon
the
package
which
lay
upon
the
ground
near
by
the
package
containing
the
material
for
her
new
dress
the
first
new
dress
that
she
had
had
in
a
whole
year
the
soft
warm
folds
of
merino
would
help
to
keep
the
life
within
his
chilled
frame
there
was
no
help
for
it
the
dress
must
go
tearing
open
the
wrapper
she
drew
forth
the
pretty
garnet
merino
and
not
without
a
little
pang
as
she
remembered
the
rebuke
which
lynne
would
have
in
store
for
her
she
wound
the
warm
folds
about
his
neck
and
chest
utterly
unprotected
herself
she
stood
shivering
beside
the
unconscious
man
chafing
his
numb
hands
and
wrapping
them
in
her
skirts
to
try
and
restore
the
circulation
the
sun
had
long
since
set
night
was
coming
swiftly
down
but
she
could
not
leave
him
to
certain
death
even
were
it
possible
for
her
to
cross
the
bridge
herself
a
thought
struck
her
she
ventured
to
slip
her
hand
timidly
into
the
pocket
of
the
young
man
coat
if
she
could
find
a
few
matches
yes
how
fortunate
there
in
a
tiny
metal
safe
impervious
to
the
water
were
plenty
of
lucifers
she
heaped
together
a
quantity
of
brushwood
and
soon
had
lighted
a
fire
all
at
once
she
saw
that
the
stranger
eyes
were
open
and
fixed
upon
her
face
with
a
strange
questioning
expression
great
dark
eyes
ideally
beautiful
he
struggled
to
a
sitting
posture
his
form
trembling
like
a
leaf
what
has
happened
he
faltered
feebly
how
came
i
here
and
you
who
are
you
my
name
is
dane
the
girl
replied
you
fell
through
the
bridge
and
i
helped
you
out
of
the
water
you
saved
my
life
ah
yes
i
remember
now
you
are
a
brave
girl
and
by
jove
as
his
glance
wandered
to
the
slight
shivering
figure
you
have
no
wrap
what
is
this
trying
to
start
to
his
feet
but
falling
back
once
more
with
an
involuntary
cry
of
pain
i
i
fear
that
i
am
going
to
faint
he
murmured
feebly
miss
dane
will
you
please
look
in
my
for
a
flask
of
brandy
she
obeyed
him
in
silence
and
fortunately
found
a
flask
nearly
filled
with
brandy
she
forced
him
gently
to
a
seat
which
she
had
prepared
of
moss
and
dry
brushwood
then
with
deft
fingers
she
removed
the
attached
to
the
flask
and
poured
it
nearly
full
of
the
liquor
she
held
it
to
his
lips
but
he
motioned
it
away
you
must
drink
some
first
he
said
in
a
tone
which
she
never
once
thought
of
disobeying
oh
yes
you
must
it
may
help
to
save
your
life
no
matter
though
you
do
not
like
it
you
must
drink
it
with
a
wry
face
the
girl
obeyed
him
and
drank
some
of
the
fiery
liquid
after
which
the
stranger
followed
her
example
then
they
crouched
before
the
fire
to
await
the
next
move
in
the
little
romance
an
hour
passed
and
then
relief
came
two
men
in
a
boat
rowing
swiftly
down
the
river
saw
beatrix
standing
in
the
light
of
the
brushwood
fire
a
few
vigorous
pulls
and
the
boat
was
landed
and
the
story
told
it
did
not
take
long
to
assist
the
stranger
into
the
boat
and
beatrix
was
safely
seated
in
the
stern
before
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
had
not
inquired
his
destination
i
was
on
my
way
to
doctor
frederick
lynne
the
young
man
explained
my
name
is
keith
kenyon
and
my
home
is
in
new
orleans
keith
kenyon
the
name
fell
upon
the
girl
ears
like
a
strain
of
music
her
great
dark
eyes
met
his
with
a
startled
glance
of
surprise
why
you
were
going
to
my
home
she
exclaimed
i
am
doctor
adopted
daughter
beatrix
dane
as
the
words
passed
her
lips
their
eyes
met
and
a
strange
subtle
thrill
went
through
beatrix
dane
heart
at
sight
of
the
strange
expression
in
his
dark
eyes
but
they
had
now
reached
the
opposite
shore
where
a
team
and
light
wagon
were
speedily
procured
and
the
men
who
were
acting
the
part
of
good
samaritans
to
the
two
so
strangely
thrown
together
drove
them
at
once
to
doctor
lynne
the
old
unpainted
house
where
beatrix
dane
had
passed
her
childhood
and
youth
and
where
the
strange
romance
of
her
young
life
was
destined
to
begin
chapter
iii
like
a
thief
in
the
night
i
wonder
what
keeps
beatrix
so
late
i
am
getting
very
uneasy
about
her
it
is
after
dark
and
snowing
hard
i
am
very
anxious
and
besides
i
been
thinking
of
the
bridge
over
the
river
i
do
believe
from
all
accounts
that
it
is
half
safe
serena
go
to
the
door
and
see
if
she
is
coming
doctor
lynne
had
grown
quite
old
and
feeble
in
the
years
that
had
elapsed
since
that
night
of
mystery
that
momentous
tenth
of
november
he
leaned
heavily
upon
his
cane
without
which
he
could
not
walk
at
all
and
turned
from
the
window
where
he
had
been
stationed
for
the
last
half
hour
serena
lynne
glanced
up
from
the
depths
of
the
big
where
she
sat
absorbed
in
a
novel
and
a
frown
disfigured
her
not
very
attractive
face
why
do
you
bother
so
about
trix
papa
she
asked
sharply
the
girl
is
able
to
take
care
of
herself
it
is
scarcely
dark
and
she
will
be
home
directly
and
she
would
go
you
know
although
mamma
tried
her
best
to
prevent
her
go
to
the
door
and
see
if
she
is
coming
repeated
frederick
lynne
sternly
serena
you
are
utterly
devoid
of
heart
trix
is
ten
years
younger
than
you
and
but
a
child
poor
little
thing
if
anything
has
happened
to
her
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
for
permitting
her
to
go
serena
lynne
laid
her
book
aside
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
rising
to
her
feet
slowly
and
unwillingly
a
tall
ungraceful
young
woman
of
some
six
or
with
flaxen
hair
and
pale
blue
eyes
not
a
beauty
by
any
means
and
it
was
the
sight
of
her
adopted
fair
young
beauty
that
made
her
invariably
and
unkind
to
beatrix
she
moved
slowly
and
ungraciously
to
the
door
and
opened
it
making
an
unlovely
picture
as
she
walked
trailing
the
folds
of
her
slatternly
blue
serge
wrapper
over
the
faded
carpet
her
feet
thrust
into
a
pair
of
ragged
slippers
her
hair
in
an
untidy
little
knot
at
the
back
of
her
head
she
wore
no
collar
none
of
the
pretty
little
devices
which
a
neat
woman
always
affects
but
a
soiled
white
shetland
shawl
was
huddled
about
her
shoulders
and
her
sharp
peevish
face
with
its
sallow
complexion
and
wide
mouth
did
not
make
a
pretty
or
lovable
picture
for
a
time
she
stood
peering
out
into
the
darkness
at
last
papa
in
a
tone
of
suppressed
excitement
i
hear
the
sound
of
wheels
i
think
i
believe
yes
it
is
a
wagon
and
it
is
stopping
at
the
gate
there
i
suppose
your
pet
beatrix
is
home
at
last
and
no
harm
done
doctor
lynne
hobbled
slowly
to
the
open
door
his
wife
the
personal
counterpart
of
her
daughter
glanced
up
from
the
pile
of
mending
with
which
she
was
occupying
herself
and
a
disagreeable
expression
settled
down
upon
her
hard
features
thank
heaven
if
she
has
really
come
at
last
she
ejaculated
that
girl
is
the
curse
of
my
life
i
only
wish
that
we
could
get
rid
of
her
i
do
see
how
we
are
going
to
support
her
now
that
the
money
has
ceased
to
come
silence
doctor
lynne
turned
sharply
upon
his
wife
i
will
hear
no
more
of
this
he
said
sternly
beatrix
dane
shall
stay
here
as
long
as
she
sees
fit
poor
child
i
imagine
that
she
would
not
remain
long
if
she
had
her
own
way
in
the
matter
serena
making
his
way
to
the
door
as
swiftly
as
he
was
able
what
is
the
matter
there
was
a
slight
bustle
upon
the
broad
veranda
outside
where
a
group
of
dark
figures
were
outlined
against
the
blackness
of
the
sky
a
moment
later
and
beatrix
flashed
into
the
room
pale
and
excited
her
eyes
shining
like
stars
oh
papa
papa
kissing
the
old
man
haggard
face
such
a
strange
thing
has
happened
the
river
bridge
broke
just
as
a
gentleman
was
crossing
on
horseback
he
fell
into
the
water
and
i
i
helped
him
all
i
could
and
he
got
out
and
oh
papa
just
think
he
was
on
his
way
to
this
house
to
you
he
is
outside
even
as
she
spoke
the
two
men
made
their
appearance
in
the
doorway
leading
between
them
the
faltering
swaying
figure
of
the
young
man
beatrix
hastily
wheeled
forward
the
which
serena
had
vacated
and
the
helpless
man
sank
into
its
capacious
depths
then
the
men
who
had
brought
beatrix
and
the
stranger
hither
took
their
departure
lynne
beatrix
turned
pleadingly
to
that
lady
will
you
not
do
something
for
this
gentleman
he
is
suffering
greatly
his
name
is
kenyon
keith
kenyon
lynne
started
to
her
feet
pale
with
surprise
why
so
it
is
she
cried
stooping
to
peer
into
the
face
of
the
man
keith
keith
look
up
thank
heaven
you
are
safe
with
us
serena
go
and
light
a
fire
in
the
spare
chamber
for
your
cousin
keith
beatrix
started
in
surprise
during
all
the
years
passed
under
that
roof
she
had
never
before
heard
of
the
existence
of
such
a
person
your
cousin
she
repeated
in
a
bewildered
way
as
serena
left
the
room
in
obedience
to
her
mother
directions
lynne
pale
eyes
flashed
to
be
sure
at
least
he
is
not
exactly
a
cousin
only
by
adoption
which
is
all
the
better
for
serena
as
i
do
not
approve
of
the
marriage
of
cousins
a
strange
pang
shot
through
beatrix
dane
girlish
heart
a
pang
which
was
to
her
quite
unaccountable
why
should
she
care
whom
keith
kenyon
married
surely
it
was
nothing
to
her
poor
little
beatrix
although
she
did
not
dream
the
truth
the
spell
of
love
was
being
woven
about
her
young
heart
out
flew
the
web
and
floated
wide
the
mirror
cracked
from
side
to
side
curse
is
come
upon
me
cried
the
lady
of
shalott
an
hour
later
the
young
man
was
placed
in
bed
in
the
warm
spare
chamber
doctor
lynne
having
examined
his
injuries
found
them
not
as
serious
as
had
been
feared
and
once
attended
to
keith
slept
the
sleep
of
exhaustion
twelve
had
struck
before
beatrix
retired
to
her
own
bare
little
chamber
and
seated
herself
before
the
fire
which
she
had
ventured
to
kindle
no
one
had
thought
of
her
or
given
her
the
slightest
attention
doctor
lynne
because
he
had
been
absorbed
in
his
patient
to
the
exclusion
of
every
other
object
the
two
women
mother
and
daughter
simply
because
they
did
not
care
beatrix
unfastened
her
beautiful
hair
and
seating
herself
before
the
fire
wrapped
a
worsted
shawl
about
her
shoulders
the
door
of
her
room
was
pushed
slowly
open
and
serena
appeared
up
yet
she
queried
in
a
shrill
sharp
voice
well
i
would
like
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
miss
beatrix
dane
by
the
way
i
wonder
if
your
name
is
really
dane
a
swift
flush
crimsoned
the
girl
pure
cheek
we
will
not
discuss
that
question
tonight
serena
she
said
gently
i
am
quite
too
tired
and
sleepy
serena
came
and
stood
before
the
fire
resting
her
sallow
cheek
against
the
ugly
wooden
mantel
tell
me
all
about
this
thrilling
adventure
of
yours
she
began
abruptly
really
it
is
quite
too
romantic
in
a
few
patient
words
beatrix
repeated
all
that
had
occurred
i
did
not
dream
that
kenyon
was
a
friend
of
yours
she
added
in
conclusion
serena
pale
eyes
sparkled
friend
he
is
more
than
a
mere
friend
she
said
eagerly
he
is
my
cousin
by
adoption
and
and
beatrix
i
have
never
told
you
before
but
i
expect
to
be
his
wife
some
day
the
word
fell
from
beatrix
dane
lips
unawares
in
an
instant
she
realized
the
mistake
that
she
had
made
i
i
beg
your
pardon
she
faltered
i
did
not
mean
to
offend
you
serena
serena
thin
lips
parted
in
a
disagreeable
smile
could
not
offend
me
if
you
tried
not
a
nameless
nobody
she
sneered
and
whatever
you
may
say
or
think
in
regard
to
the
matter
the
truth
remains
i
am
engaged
to
marry
keith
kenyon
are
you
satisfied
what
else
do
you
imagine
has
brought
him
to
this
place
it
seems
that
he
telegraphed
to
papa
that
he
was
coming
but
the
stupid
idiots
at
the
station
neglected
to
send
the
message
out
here
i
shall
be
glad
when
i
get
away
from
this
hateful
hole
and
live
in
a
large
city
in
an
elegant
house
with
everything
that
heart
can
wish
keith
home
is
in
new
orleans
and
i
have
always
felt
a
great
desire
to
visit
the
south
new
orleans
the
name
aroused
beatrix
with
a
little
start
for
the
first
time
since
her
arrival
home
she
remembered
the
letter
that
had
come
from
new
orleans
for
doctor
lynne
she
searched
hastily
in
the
pocket
of
her
dress
for
the
missive
yes
it
was
there
all
safe
i
must
see
papa
at
once
she
observed
rising
to
her
feet
indeed
mimicked
serena
contemptuously
if
i
were
you
i
would
wait
until
i
could
prove
my
right
to
call
any
one
by
that
name
before
i
not
another
word
i
will
hear
no
more
of
your
insolence
leave
my
room
serena
lynne
and
never
enter
it
again
until
you
can
treat
me
with
proper
respect
well
i
declare
good
gracious
what
next
how
we
put
on
airs
for
my
part
i
very
well
if
you
will
not
vacate
i
shall
leave
the
room
myself
cried
beatrix
too
indignant
to
endure
any
more
she
was
faint
and
exhausted
from
fatigue
and
the
exposures
of
the
night
no
one
had
offered
her
even
a
cup
of
tea
or
the
slightest
refreshment
after
her
adventure
in
the
cold
night
air
chilled
and
half
clothed
as
she
had
been
and
she
was
not
enough
at
home
in
the
house
where
she
had
lived
for
sixteen
years
to
venture
to
suggest
her
need
of
refreshment
she
flashed
swiftly
past
the
discomfited
serena
and
down
the
bare
stairs
to
doctor
lynne
large
cheerful
sleeping
apartment
lynne
was
still
with
the
patient
and
peeping
in
at
the
open
door
of
doctor
lynne
room
beatrix
was
so
fortunate
as
to
find
him
there
alone
papa
hesitatingly
may
i
speak
with
you
frederick
lynne
glanced
up
and
a
glad
light
flashed
over
his
worn
countenance
certainly
my
dear
he
returned
come
in
why
beatrix
child
with
a
startled
glance
into
her
white
face
you
are
ill
exhausted
how
thoughtless
and
selfish
in
me
not
to
think
of
you
before
here
drink
a
glass
of
wine
he
filled
a
glass
from
the
decanter
of
wine
upon
the
table
and
held
it
to
her
lips
beatrix
drained
the
contents
of
the
glass
then
she
sank
wearily
into
the
empty
chair
at
his
side
papa
do
you
know
anything
concerning
my
parents
my
real
parents
she
asked
abruptly
his
face
grew
pale
no
dear
you
have
heard
all
that
i
know
in
regard
to
your
history
do
not
trouble
yourself
beatrix
it
will
all
come
right
some
time
i
am
sure
try
to
have
faith
that
all
is
for
the
best
i
wish
i
could
i
am
tired
of
this
life
tired
of
living
here
with
lynne
and
serena
i
shall
be
glad
to
go
out
into
the
world
and
earn
my
own
living
do
look
so
horrified
daddy
darling
and
by
the
way
i
nearly
forgot
my
errand
here
to
you
i
have
a
letter
for
you
she
drew
the
letter
from
her
pocket
and
laid
it
in
his
hand
at
sight
of
the
superscription
his
face
grew
pale
as
death
breaking
the
seal
with
a
trembling
hand
he
drew
forth
two
inclosures
two
separate
letters
go
my
dear
he
said
gently
it
is
late
and
you
must
retire
now
besides
i
would
rather
be
alone
kiss
me
beatrix
my
little
comfort
she
stooped
and
putting
her
white
arms
about
his
neck
laid
her
warm
red
lips
upon
his
papa
darling
she
whispered
at
the
door
of
the
room
she
paused
and
looked
back
he
was
sitting
in
a
dejected
attitude
his
white
head
resting
upon
one
hand
the
other
held
the
letters
she
went
slowly
and
thoughtfully
upstairs
back
to
her
own
room
and
retiring
was
soon
sound
asleep
she
was
aroused
from
slumber
by
a
shrill
shriek
which
resounded
through
the
silent
house
starting
to
her
feet
beatrix
threw
on
a
loose
wrapper
and
thrusting
her
bare
feet
into
a
pair
of
slippers
left
the
room
and
flew
swiftly
she
made
her
way
instinctively
to
doctor
lynne
room
he
was
seated
in
his
before
the
fire
just
as
she
had
left
him
while
his
wife
whose
cry
of
horror
had
aroused
the
house
stood
near
pale
and
terrified
one
of
the
letters
which
he
had
received
had
been
destroyed
by
fire
only
a
heap
of
fragments
upon
the
hearth
remained
to
tell
the
tale
but
one
hand
clutched
the
other
letter
in
a
convulsive
grasp
as
he
sat
there
white
and
still
and
dead
death
had
stolen
in
like
a
thief
in
the
night
and
he
was
gone
forever
the
letter
which
that
cold
stiff
hand
clutched
tenaciously
was
found
to
contain
these
words

chapter
iv
a
mad
passion
cold
and
still
in
death
frederick
lynne
sat
in
his
big
one
icy
hand
clutching
the
letter
which
bade
beatrix
face
an
unknown
and
dreaded
future
face
it
all
alone
lynne
stood
near
crying
aloud
in
terrified
accents
for
help
for
succor
her
face
as
white
as
the
dead
man
when
beatrix
entered
the
room
one
swift
glance
which
did
not
comprehend
the
situation
for
poor
beatrix
knew
nothing
of
the
horrors
of
death
and
had
never
faced
it
before
one
swift
terrified
glance
and
she
flew
to
the
dead
man
side
papa
oh
papa
she
cried
in
an
agonized
voice
what
is
the
matter
dear
are
you
ill
are
you
lynne
bony
hand
came
down
upon
the
girl
arm
with
emphasis
be
quiet
you
baby
she
panted
ca
you
see
that
he
is
is
the
girl
fell
back
as
though
the
heavy
hand
had
struck
her
a
blow
her
great
dark
eyes
dilated
with
horror
the
small
hands
clinched
each
other
spasmodically
her
breath
came
and
went
in
short
panting
gasps
could
it
be
true
was
this
grim
death
before
her
was
the
kindly
heart
the
heart
of
her
only
friend
cold
and
still
forever
it
could
not
could
not
be
dead
she
repeated
blankly
her
lips
quivering
over
the
awful
word
dead
oh
no
lynne
surely
you
are
mistaken
let
us
try
to
do
something
for
him
i
will
call
serena

stay
with
you
and
i
will
go
for
help

can

many
times
beatrix
dane
to
be
mistaken
i
tell
you
he
is
dead
and
has
been
for
hours
he
is
quite
cold
see
with
a
slow
reluctant
movement
beatrix
ventured
to
lay
her
trembling
fingers
upon
the
cold
rigid
hand
of
the
corpse
she
drew
back
with
a
low
cry
of
terror
oh
how
cold
how
cold
she
moaned
oh
papa
papa
papa
cold
and
dead
it
is
true

indeed
true
oh
lynne

lynne
thin
lip
curled
what
will
i
do
you
mean
she
retorted
it
can
have
no
effect
upon
you
see
that
letter
in
his
hand
is
a
message
for
you
you
are
to
go
away
at
once
to
your
own
home
thank
goodness
the
great
brown
velvety
eyes
met
the
cold
orbs
before
her
with
a
stare
of
astonishment
go
home
to
my
own
home
mrs
lynne
she
repeated
blankly
why
i
have
no
home
but
this
indeed
and
pray
who
gave
you
a
right
to
call
this
home
such
as
it
is
it
is
the
only
shelter
that
you
have
had
for
sixteen
years
you
ought
to
be
ready
to
leave
it
now
you
are
nearly
seventeen
years
old
and
able
to
take
care
of
yourself
ah
there
is
serena
at
last
as
a
limp
figure
made
its
appearance
in
the
open
door
a
tall
ungraceful
figure
in
a
calico
wrapper
and
muffled
in
a
huge
woolen
shawl
in
a
tone
of
consternation
what
has
happened
what
is
the
matter
with
papa
is
he
ill
lynne
wound
her
arms
around
the
angular
form
of
her
daughter
and
burst
into
tears
the
first
real
emotion
which
she
had
ever
betrayed
before
beatrix
he
is
serena
she
faltered
dead
and
gone
and
heaven
only
knows
what
is
to
become
of
you
and
me
not
even
sufficient
means
in
the
house
to
defray
the
funeral
expenses
and
of
course
with
his
death
the
small
pension
which
he
received
from
his
professional
brethren
of
the
medical
club
expires
also
oh
dear
oh
dear
it
was
an
unfortunate
day
when
i
married
fred
lynne
and
tied
myself
down
to
poverty
well
well
that
was
long
enough
ago
for
you
to
forget
it
now
interposed
her
dutiful
daughter
mamma
putting
away
her
arms
from
about
her
neck
whatever
you
do
do
be
foolish
have
you
tried
to
restore
him
he
may
not
be
dead
after
all
he
dead
i
have
done
everything
that
i
possibly
could
before
i
called
any
one
when
i
found
all
my
efforts
useless
i
gave
up
in
despair
and
i
screamed
so
loudly
that
it
awoke
beatrix
and
she
came
to
the
room
ah
with
a
swift
glance
of
malice
into
the
girl
white
face
and
so
heard
you
she
is
always
sneaking
around
where
she
is
not
wanted
mamma
have
you
have
you
read
that
letter
pointing
to
the
crumpled
sheet
of
paper
which
lynne
had
with
great
difficulty
succeeded
in
removing
from
the
cold
hand
of
the
dead
man
yes
it
contains
the
very
best
news
imaginable
it
is
a
letter
from
that
girl
people
sending
for
her
at
last
impossible
why
i
did
not
believe
that
she
had
any
people
but
there
is
another
letter
upon
the
hearth
see
it
is
burned
i
believe
papa
destroyed
it
as
soon
as
he
read
it
for
some
purpose
of
his
own
how
very
exasperating
serena
was
on
her
knees
now
upon
the
hearth
eagerly
but
carefully
turning
over
the
blackened
sheet
of
paper
which
had
been
torn
in
four
pieces
and
cast
upon
the
fire
but
the
fire
was
at
its
last
gasp
when
the
deed
was
done
and
the
paper
had
not
burned
only
blackened
and
scorched
until
the
contents
of
the
letter
were
perfectly
undecipherable
serena
examined
the
written
sheet
attentively
and
her
face
grew
dark
with
intense
disappointment
how
provoking
she
muttered
savagely
there
was
no
doubt
something
of
importance
in
that
letter
i
believe
in
my
heart
that
the
news
it
contained
has
killed
my
father
yet
he
has
destroyed
the
letter
and
there
is
nothing
left
to
tell
the
tale
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
glanced
furtively
around
beatrix
had
thrown
herself
upon
the
faded
sofa
and
was
sobbing
softly
her
face
hid
in
her
hands
lynne
was
beginning
to
make
some
attempt
at
arranging
the
poor
body
an
attempt
which
must
be
made
alone
since
they
were
so
isolated
from
neighbors
no
one
observed
serena
movements
her
eyes
glittered
with
a
curious
brassy
light
with
a
swift
gliding
movement
she
hastened
to
an
cabinet
which
stood
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
opening
it
removed
an
empty
tin
box
from
a
shelf
with
hands
that
trembled
a
little
in
spite
of
her
efforts
to
control
herself
she
carried
the
box
over
to
the
fireplace
and
going
down
upon
her
knees
once
more
she
lifted
the
fragments
of
the
letter
and
placed
them
as
carefully
within
the
box
as
though
that
letter
had
been
worth
many
times
its
weight
in
gold
and
so
it
was
a
thousand
times
over
as
serena
lynne
was
destined
to
discover
some
future
day
securing
the
lid
upon
the
box
she
rose
softly
and
hastened
away
upstairs
to
her
own
room
once
there
she
hid
the
tin
box
in
her
trunk
and
locked
it
carefully
then
with
an
inscrutable
expression
upon
her
pale
cold
face
she
glided
swiftly
down
the
stairs
once
more
on
her
way
back
to
the
apartment
where
her
dead
father
lay
she
paused
at
the
door
of
keith
kenyon
room
it
was
standing
ajar
and
she
ventured
to
steal
inside
he
was
sleeping
heavily
under
the
influence
of
the
strong
opiate
which
doctor
lynne
had
given
him
serena
stood
gazing
at
the
sleeper
her
plain
face
all
aglow
with
rapture
her
pale
eyes
gleaming
with
a
look
of
devouring
love
and
passionate
adoration
oh
my
love
my
love
she
murmured
softly
i
would
lay
my
life
down
for
your
dear
sake
i
would
die
a
thousand
deaths
i
would
suffer
martyrdom
to
win
your
heart
oh
keith
keith
my
hero
my
only
love
whom
i
have
loved
all
my
life
ever
since
my
childhood
days
when
you
were
with
us
and
i
have
never
forgotten
you
never
ceased
to
care
your
little
sweetheart
you
called
me
then
and
you
used
to
tell
me
that
some
day
when
we
were
man
and
woman
grown
i
should
be
your
wife
and
so
i
shall
you
shall
call
no
other
woman

oh
keith
if
you
do
not
love
me
i
shall
die
i
shall
die
the
sleeper
moved
uneasily
upon
the
pillow
and
the
beautiful
lips
parted
slightly
while
low
and
sweet
but
clear
and
distinct
to
the
ears
of
the
listener
came
the
one
muttered
word
it
was
enough
to
arouse
the
slumbering
devil
in
the
woman
breast
she
started
as
though
she
had
been
shot
a
moan
of
bitter
anguish
passed
her
lips
and
fell
upon
the
dead
silence
of
the
she
turned
blindly
like
one
groping
in
the
dark
and
fled
back
to
the
her
mother
glanced
up
from
her
grewsome
work
as
serena
entered
and
her
ghastly
face
and
flashing
eyes
made
the
mother
start
with
a
strange
alarm
and
terror
what
is
it
she
cried
wildly
what
else
has
happened
where
is
that
girl
demanded
serena
glancing
wildly
around
the
room

has
gone
for
assistance

chapter
on
the
eve
of
departure
out
in
the
cold
starry
night
beatrix
was
riding
swiftly
on
to
the
little
town
of
burtonville
a
small
settlement
which
lay
some
three
miles
beyond
the
home
of
the
lynnes
it
was
isolated
from
the
railroad
and
was
in
fact
only
a
handful
of
houses
dropped
down
in
the
midst
of
the
woods
for
no
apparent
purpose
whatever
the
wind
blew
shrill
and
cold
but
the
girl
had
wrapped
herself
warmly
and
did
not
mind
it
as
she
galloped
on
in
the
face
of
the
blast
she
had
only
one
thought
to
occupy
her
the
good
old
man
whom
she
had
loved
as
a
father
was
dead
never
more
would
she
hear
his
kindly
voice
never
more
would
she
listen
to
his
gentle
words
she
thought
of
the
parting
that
night
and
her
heart
thrilled
with
thankfulness
that
she
had
come
back
to
kiss
him
and
bid
him
for
the
last
time
she
murmured
sadly
the
very
last
time
poor
papa
on
she
went
until
the
three
miles
were
covered
and
she
drew
rein
before
a
tiny
brown
cottage
where
dwelt
their
kind
friends
the
rogerses
dismounting
she
rapped
loudly
at
the
outer
door
her
summons
aroused
the
inmates
and
in
a
few
moments
her
sad
story
was
told
both
and
rogers
hastily
prepared
themselves
to
return
with
beatrix
to
the
desolate
home
of
the
lynnes
and
so
in
the
course
of
an
hour
they
entered
the
old
house
upon
whose
portals
death
had
left
its
dreadful
sign
once
inside
and
satisfied
that
lynne
would
be
relieved
from
further
cares
beatrix
made
her
way
slowly
falteringly
up
to
her
own
chamber
and
once
there
fainted
quietly
away
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
the
natural
reaction
to
all
the
excitement
of
the
day
had
come
and
the
girl
strength
could
endure
no
more
a
little
later
serena
passing
the
open
door
saw
beatrix
lying
upon
the
floor
where
she
had
fallen
she
came
swiftly
to
her
side
and
gazed
into
the
pale
little
face
with
eyes
full
of
hatred
i
wish
she
was
dead
hissed
the
woman
bleakly
i
wish
to
heaven
she
would
never
recover
from
this
swoon
never
open
her
eyes
to
the
world
again
i
hate
her
i
can
not
help
it
she
will
steal
him
from
me
the
only
man
for
whom
i
shall
ever
care
keith
might
have
learned
to
love
me
in
time
but
of
course
a
face
like
hers
is
certain
to
win
the
prize
i
am
plain
i
know
it
and
i
can
not
deny
that
beatrix
is
lovely
but
i
would
have
been
a
good
wife
to
keith
i
would
lay
my
life
down
for
him
i
would
be
willing
to
be
his
slave
if
only
he
would
love
me
oh
keith
keith
heart
of
my
heart
soul
of
my
soul
she
turned
away
wringing
her
hands
frantically
if
i
can
not
win
you
it
would
be
better
for
me
to
die
she
left
the
unconscious
girl
alone
and
calling
rogers
sent
her
to
beatrix
assistance
it
was
hours
before
the
poor
girl
was
fully
restored
she
looked
like
a
as
she
moved
silently
about
the
house
in
the
plain
black
gown
which
had
been
provided
for
her
she
was
pale
and
wan
and
her
great
dark
eyes
looked
unnaturally
bright
and
shone
like
stars
two
days
later
the
funeral
took
place
and
frederick
lynne
was
buried
away
out
of
sight
in
the
bare
bleak
little
over
which
the
first
snow
lay
soft
and
warm
like
a
blanket
the
day
after
the
funeral
rogers
driving
over
from
the
the
bridge
having
been
repaired
paused
at
the
dreary
home
of
the
lynnes
with
a
registered
letter
addressed
to
its
late
master
i
took
the
liberty
of
signing
for
it
he
said
as
he
placed
the
letter
in
lynne
outstretched
hand
and
then
with
a
kindly
inquiry
for
keith
kenyon
and
a
cheerful
he
took
his
departure
without
a
moment
delay
lynne
tore
open
the
letter
with
eager
haste
a
crisp
dollar
bill
dropped
from
between
the
folded
pages
she
picked
it
up
with
a
gasp
of
delight
and
just
at
that
moment
beatrix
entered
the
room
there
was
no
help
for
it
lynne
knew
that
the
letter
and
its
inclosure
must
be
at
once
turned
over
to
the
girl
she
placed
it
in
her
hand
there
that
is
yours
i
suppose
she
said
ungraciously
with
dilated
eyes
beatrix
read
the
words
addressed
to
frederick
lynne
doctor
lynne
so
ran
the
letter
i
send
inclosed
five
hundred
dollars
per
registered
mail
the
most
convenient
way
of
forwarding
remittances
since
you
are
residing
in
a
place
destitute
of
banks
and
other
conveniences
send
beatrix
dane
to
new
orleans
immediately
to
no
charles
avenue
and
oblige
yours
respectfully
bernard
dane
beatrix
lifted
her
eyes
and
they
met
the
cold
gaze
of
lynne
how
much
will
my
ticket
cost
she
asked
abruptly
lynne
made
no
reply
will
you
please
get
the
money
changed
persisted
beatrix
gently
laying
the
bill
in
the
woman
hand
i
will
take
one
hundred
dollars
the
rest
is
yours
a
swift
gleam
passed
over
the
hard
countenance
do
you
mean
it
she
cried
beatrix
red
lip
curled
scornfully
certainly
i
have
been
an
expense
to
you
ever
since
the
remittances
failed
to
come
and
now
lynne
i
suppose
i
had
better
prepare
at
once
for
my
journey
lynne
did
not
attempt
to
dissuade
her
the
simple
preparations
were
soon
completed
and
it
was
arranged
that
beatrix
should
start
on
the
early
train
the
next
morning
late
in
the
day
as
beatrix
was
passing
the
open
door
of
the
she
heard
her
name
called
in
a
low
eager
tone
she
paused
hesitatingly
come
in
will
you
not
keith
kenyon
asked
softly
she
came
swiftly
to
the
bedside
i
hope
you
are
feeling
better
she
ventured
timidly
for
this
was
the
first
time
she
had
seen
him
since
the
accident
his
beautiful
eyes
lighted
up
with
a
tender
light
he
took
her
hand
in
his
why
have
you
not
come
to
see
me
he
asked
in
a
low
tone
i
have
begged
serena
and
aunt
lynne
to
ask
you
to
come
for
a
moment
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
such
a
strange
thing
to
tell
you
miss
dane
it
seems
like
a
romance
this
that
i
have
to
say
but
first
let
me
thank
you
for
saving
my
life
her
face
flushed
and
then
grew
pale
i
have
done
nothing
she
faltered
i
only
wish
she
paused
and
for
a
brief
moment
their
eyes
met
a
sweet
nameless
thrill
passed
from
heart
to
heart
he
laid
her
little
hand
against
his
lips
my
darling
he
was
beginning
passionately
but
the
words
died
upon
his
lips
checked
abruptly
for
there
in
the
open
door
stood
lynne
pale
with
wrath
her
eyes
blazing
she
panted
wrathfully
good
gracious
girl
what
are
you
doing
here
this
is
no
place
for
you
how
improper
how
improper
and
unmaidenly
blushing
like
a
rose
with
mortification
poor
beatrix
fled
swiftly
from
the
room
and
little
did
she
dream
of
the
strange
announcement
which
had
been
upon
the
lips
of
keith
kenyon
lynne
followed
the
girl
to
her
own
room
and
once
there
closed
its
door
behind
her
you
creature
she
panted
angrily
how
dared
you
enter
keith
kenyon
room
alone
you
are
utterly
shameless
the
beautiful
eyes
met
the
fiery
orbs
before
her
with
brave
frankness
kenyon
called
me
he
had
something
to
tell
me
he
said
she
returned
quietly
and
i
could
not
refuse
to
see
him
i
have
not
seen
him
before
since
the
accident
and
i
will
take
care
that
you
shall
not
see
him
again
hissed
the
woman
fiercely
such
conduct
is
terrible
it
is
positively
shocking
for
an
unmarried
woman
a
mere
girl
to
enter
a
man
the
girl
eyes
flashed
ominously
if
it
is
improper
for
me
lynne
she
returned
coldly
it
must
be
the
same
for
serena
she
is
not
married
although
she
is
rather
an
old
girl
she
added
naïvely
you
wretch
lynne
was
almost
speechless
with
wrath
how
you
she
hissed
bringing
her
hand
down
upon
the
shrinking
shoulder
with
savage
emphasis
how
you
call
serena
old
she
is
nearly
returned
beatrix
coolly
not
old
to
be
sure
but
certainly
old
enough
to
know
how
to
behave
herself
i
think
that
not
another
word
or
i
will
strike
you
you
shall
not
beatrix
faced
the
termagant
before
her
with
a
white
resolute
face
and
a
look
in
the
depths
of
her
dark
eyes
which
made
lynne
quail
as
i
intend
going
over
to
the
village
tonight
said
beatrix
quietly
that
i
may
be
in
time
for
the
train
in
the
morning
i
may
as
well
bid
you
i
think
that
you
will
be
sorry
some
day
for
the
way
that
you
have
treated
me
mrs
lynne
she
closed
the
door
behind
the
retreating
figure
of
her
tormentor
and
made
ready
for
the
journey
a
little
later
she
came
down
the
stairs
attired
in
a
her
only
baggage
a
small
everything
was
as
still
as
death
she
stole
softly
to
the
door
of
the
room
where
keith
kenyon
lay
upon
his
the
door
was
closed
she
paused
and
laid
her
hot
cheek
against
the
cold
hard
panel
of
the
door
her
sore
heart
swelling
with
bitter
resentment
she
whispered
softly
i
shall
never
see
you
again
my
friend
that
might
have
been
never
see
him
again
yet
how
can
beatrix
dane
know
that
in
the
long
dark
days
before
her
how
can
she
tell
what
the
strange
chances
in
life
lottery
may
bring
her
it
is
well
that
she
does
not
know
how
many
of
us
knowing
the
future
would
shrink
from
the
ordeal
before
us
and
pray
for
the
boon
of
death
chapter
vi
her
oath
in
a
spacious
chamber
of
a
great
gloomy
mansion
an
old
man
sat
alone
his
gray
head
bowed
upon
his
trembling
hands
which
rested
upon
a
cane
a
few
blocks
away
the
hum
and
traffic
of
the
crescent
city
filled
the
air
but
here
all
was
still
and
quiet
an
mansion
embowered
in
huge
a
shady
silent
place
the
sight
of
which
made
one
feel
gloomy
and
caused
a
slight
chill
to
pass
involuntarily
over
the
frame
the
great
house
looked
like
an
enchanted
palace
with
old
bernard
dane
the
presiding
genii
all
alone
and
lonely
like
the
last
leaf
upon
the
tree
the
moments
came
and
went
and
still
he
sat
there
silent
and
alone
once
in
awhile
a
few
muttered
words
would
pass
his
grim
lips
and
the
wrinkled
hands
upon
the
would
clinch
each
other
savagely
at
last
he
lifted
his
head
and
turning
slowly
in
his
pressed
the
electric
button
in
the
wall
at
his
side
a
moment
later
an
obsequious
servant
entered
a
black
servitor
in
the
dane
family
for
years
any
news
simons
asked
bernard
dane
eagerly
the
man
shook
his
head
no
sah

wide

but
to
see
that
boy
back
again
with
his
errand
done
as
i
directed
him
it
was
a
wise
thought
of
mine
a
wise
thought
to
send
him

throw
two
young
fools
together
under
the
circumstances
and
they
fall
in
love
with
each
other
as
sure
as
they
live
bah
if

my
way
that
word
should
be
stricken
from

the
cause
of

sin

sorrow
in

the
idol
and
he
could
not
get
rid
of
the
thing
no
matter
what
he
did
he
hid
it
gave
it
away
lost
it
drowned
it
buried
it
left
no
stone
unturned
to
be
rid
of
its
cursed
presence
it
was
ruining
his
life
and
making
him
contemplate
suicide
but
all
his
efforts
were
in
vain
even
theosophy
itself
was
of
no
avail
and
to
my
way
of
thinking
theosophy
can
do
much
and
so
the
poor
fellow
was
cursed
by
the
presence
of
this
idol
a
black
evil
shadow
upon
his
life
until
a
bolt
of
thunder
and
a
flash
of
lightning
shivered
the
thing
to
fragments
direct
interposition
of
providence
ah
yes
to
be
sure
simons
flashing
about
swiftly
as
his
eyes

tell
you

i
never

then
hear
me
now
and
the
heavy
cane
came
down
upon
the
floor
with
emphasis
outside
a
night
of
storm
and
tempest
the
roar
of
the
wind
the
beating
rain
or
roar
of
the
elements
which
after
all
is
no
more
fierce
and
bitter
than
that
which
often
rages
within
a
human
breast
the
wind
shrieked
shrilly
down
the
chimney
the
trees
swayed
in
the
blast
and
tapped
upon
the
crystal
with
bare
ghostly
fingers
old
bernard
dane
drew
a
little
nearer
the
fire
and
wrapped
his
silken
about
his
gaunt
frame
what
is
it
he
demanded
as
simons
was
about
to
withdraw

simons
and
make

the
negro
obeyed
in
silence
and
the
door
closed
behind
him
bernard
dane
head
drooped
once
more
upon
his
clasped
hands
and
save
for
his
slow
labored
breathing
there
was
no
sound
to
break
the
dreary
silence
of
the
room
the
moments
came
and
went
until
five
twice
five
three
times
five
were
ticked
away
then
the
chamber
door
opened
noiselessly
so
noiselessly
that
bernard
dane
did
not
hear
it
and
a
slight
figure
stole
softly
into
the
room
and
stood
beside
the
hearth
a
forlorn
little
figure
in
an
dingy
black
gown
with
a
dowdyish
hat
pushed
back
from
the
pale
little
face
with
its
tired
drooping
mouth
and
great
glorious
dark
eyes
full
of
a
weary
light
i
am
beatrix
dane
said
a
soft
voice
timidly
the
old
man
lifted
his
head
and
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
face
before
him
a
strange
change
passed
over
his
stern
features
a
look
of
slow
horror
froze
his
face
down
like
an
icy
mask
he
arose
to
his
feet
tall
gaunt
grim
but
in
the
presence
of
this
slip
of
a
girl
he
was
trembling
as
though
he
was
afraid
powers
above
he
panted
brokenly
when
did
you
arrive
where
is
is
surely
you
did
not
travel
all
this
distance
alone
his
voice
trembling
with
an
inflection
of
surprise
which
was
almost
terror
yes
sir
i
came
alone
there
was
no
help
for
it
oh
dane
i
have
such
dreadful
news
to
tell
you
papa
is
dead
he
died
of
heart
disease
while
he
was
reading
your
last
letters
to
him
papa
the
scornful
intonation
in
bernard
dane
voice
was
a
revelation
papa
indeed
ha
ha
have
no
father
no
i
do
not
mean
that
you
are
not
legitimate
but
it
is
worse
than
that
upon
whom
the
curse
of
god
has
fallen
can
have
no
claim
of
near
kinship
with
any
one
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
to
be
the
father
of
a
creature
like
like
girl
do
you
know
that
you
are
accursed
that
you
have
a
destiny
to
fulfill
the
very
thought
of
which
makes
my
heart
stand
still
with
horror
you
have
a
dark
inheritance
in
store
and
may
heaven
give
you
strength
to
bear
your
burden
for
is
the
help
of
men
no
i
am
not
insane
there
is
no
insanity
in
the
dane
family
i
am
not
idiotic
i
am
as
sane
and
sound
as
you
are
and
more
than
you
will
be
when
you
learn
the
truth
concerning
yourself
do
shrink
away
and
cower
out
of
sight
like
that
be
a
woman
do
you
know
what
that
means
it
means
to
bear
the
burden
of
another
sin
to
carry
its
consequences
about
in
your
heart
your
tender
guiltless
woman
heart
until
your
life
is
darkened
and
ruined
forever
it
means
to
suffer
in
secret
and
silence
and
to
lie
down
and
die
sooner
than
see
the
one
punished
for
whom
you
suffer
is
to
be
a
woman
there
i
have
no
more
to
say
tonight
no
wait
a
moment
before
you
go
to
your
own
room
which
i
have
had
prepared
for
you
come
here
and
let
me
look
at
you
yes
to
be
sure
you
are
fair
i
thought
that
you
would
be
you
are
beautiful
indeed
oh
heavens

a
fate
what
a
fate
for
one
so
young
and
fair
now
beatrix
dane
answer
me
have
you
come
here
prepared
to
render
strict
obedience
to
my
wishes
you
do
not
know
what
right
i
have
to
direct
you
ah
so
i
thought
well
you
may
call
me
uncle
uncle
bernard
the
first
relative
you
have
ever
known
well
pray
heaven
it
may
be
the
last
now
listen
while
i
tell
you
why
i
have
sent
for
you
at
this
late
day
she
came
a
little
nearer
and
lifted
her
piteous
pleading
eyes
to
his
stern
face
uncle
uncle
bernard
she
faltered
timidly
please
do
speak
such
wild
harsh
words
to
me
tonight
let
me
hear
you
say
something
kind
remember
i
have
no
one
in
the
wide
world
but
you
i
promise
to
be
good
and
obedient
i
promise
to
obey
you
like
a
slave
to
do
anything

say
no
one
has
ever
loved
me
wo
you
try
to
love
me
a
little
only
a
little
i
promise
to
do
whatever
you
may
wish
me
to
do
you
promise
his
wrinkled
face
lighted
up
with
a
swift
gleam
of
triumph
to
do
as
i
wish
he
panted
desperately
i
demand
that
you
do
so
swear
to
obey
me
implicitly
beatrix
dane
the
beautiful
eyes
drooped
for
an
instant
surely
he
would
exact
no
promise
of
her
beyond
her
power
to
fulfill
could
a
man
an
old
man
be
so
hard
upon
a
poor
weak
timid
creature
utterly
defenseless
like
herself
for
she
had
yet
to
learn
poor
ignorant
child
that
with
some
men
makes
right
i
swear
it
uncle
bernard
she
said
slowly
now
kiss
me
and
say
that
you
will
love
me
a
little
and
she
ventured
to
lay
one
small
hand
timidly
upon
his
arm
with
a
hoarse
inarticulate
cry
he
struck
the
little
hand
aside
and
started
to
his
feet
do
touch
me
he
panted
wildly
do
to
touch
me
you
i
would
sooner
cut
my
own
throat
get
away
away
out
of
my
sight
do
you
hear
no
wait
until
i
have
told
you
what
i
wish
you
to
do
and
remember
beatrix
dane
you
have
to
obey
me
i
have
sent
for
you
for
a
particular
object
for
that
object
i
have
had
you
reared
and
educated
the
time
has
come
to
carry
out
my
plan
it
is
this
i
have
sent
for
you
beatrix
dane
to
marry
the
man
whom
i
have
chosen
for
you
the
son
of
my
adoption
you
must
become
his
wife
at
the
time
i
have
appointed
or
you
will
wish
that
you
had
never
been
born
chapter
vii
betrothed
the
days
came
and
went
with
slow
monotonous
round
in
the
old
brown
house
where
keith
kenyon
lay
ill
unto
death
lynne
scarcely
left
his
bedside
she
was
a
skillful
nurse
and
in
this
case
she
felt
more
than
an
ordinary
interest
for
she
had
come
to
look
upon
keith
as
a
prospective
when
he
was
a
child
a
little
fatherless
motherless
babe
he
had
been
placed
in
care
of
sister
to
be
reared
it
was
after
he
had
grown
to
be
a
youth
of
fifteen
that
he
had
been
formally
adopted
by
an
old
man
in
new
orleans
of
whose
name
lynne
and
serena
were
both
ignorant
they
had
only
heard
of
the
mere
fact
of
his
adoption
the
years
had
come
and
gone
and
although
he
wrote
occasionally
to
lynne
and
always
inclosed
a
kindly
message
and
sometimes
a
few
written
lines
to
serena
he
had
never
confided
absolutely
in
them
and
they
had
refrained
from
asking
questions
year
after
year
he
had
written
that
he
hoped
to
find
an
opportunity
to
visit
his
old
friends
but
heretofore
he
had
found
it
impossible
to
keep
his
promise
there
is
a
certain
place
unmentionable
to
ears
polite
which
is
popularly
believed
to
be
paved
with
good
intentions
keith
kenyon
had
evidently
laid
a
block
or
two
of
this
pavement
at
all
events
his
intentions
though
good
had
come
to
naught
and
now
just
when
the
mother
and
daughter
had
given
up
all
hope
of
ever
seeing
him
again
he
had
suddenly
appeared
at
their
home
for
all
these
years
the
long
long
time
since
their
last
meeting
years
during
which
keith
kenyon
had
not
given
many
thoughts
to
serena
and
even
then
only
thinking
of
her
as
his
childish
playmate
she
had
thought
of
him
with
a
steady
and
unwavering
interest
and
a
fixed
intention
to
some
day
become
his
wife
the
news
of
his
adoption
by
a
wealthy
old
man
had
not
lessened
her
interest
in
keith
or
her
resolution
to
marry
him
he
would
be
rich
some
day
she
was
tired
of
the
weary
battle
with
poverty
and
longed
with
all
her
mercenary
heart
and
narrow
soul
to
enjoy
the
advantages
of
wealth
and
position
and
as
the
years
went
by
her
purpose
grew
with
them
she
had
but
one
object
in
life
to
marry
keith
kenyon
and
share
his
fortune
yet
now
that
she
had
met
him
at
last
her
love
for
him
had
grown
to
such
great
proportions
that
even
had
he
not
been
the
rich
man
heir
in
prospective
she
would
have
been
willing
to
marry
him
had
he
chosen
her
to
be
his
wife
but
fate
had
decreed
that
he
should
choose
otherwise
after
doctor
lynne
burial
keith
grew
rapidly
worse
and
was
soon
in
a
raging
fever
with
small
hopes
of
recovery
doctor
stone
the
village
physician
called
every
day
to
see
the
patient
and
his
wrinkled
face
grew
graver
and
graver
as
he
marked
the
alarming
symptoms
i
fear
for
the
worst
he
said
to
lynne
at
last
and
then
into
that
astute
lady
heart
a
swift
inspiration
rushed
like
a
flood
her
eyes
wore
a
look
of
resolution
and
she
shut
her
thin
lips
grimly
together
as
she
hissed
sharply
he
shall
make
serena
his
wife
before
he
dies
she
shall
be
his
wife
and
then
she
will
be
able
to
claim
a
portion
of
the
fortune
it
shall
be
so
she
was
passing
the
open
door
of
the
one
day
when
she
was
startled
by
hearing
keith
voice
weak
and
tremulous
calling
her
name
she
came
to
a
halt
her
face
pale
with
surprise
for
he
had
not
spoken
for
several
days
only
the
wild
ravings
of
delirium
what
is
it
keith
she
asked
going
swiftly
to
the
bedside
his
great
dark
eyes
were
lifted
to
her
face
with
a
wistful
look
in
their
depths
beatrix
he
faltered
feebly
i
want
beatrix
where
is
she
a
look
of
fiendish
hatred
flashed
into
lynne
pale
eyes
and
the
bony
hands
clutched
each
other
fiercely
beatrix
is
not
here
she
replied
he
started
up
wildly
then
fell
back
upon
the
pillows
faint
and
exhausted
not
here
he
repeated
brokenly
oh
lynne
do
tell
me
that
she
is
gone
why
she
could
not
go
all
alone
and
he
he
sent
me
here
for
her
sent
you
for
her
who
sent
you
demanded
lynne
sharply
uncle
bernard
that
was
my
business
here
in
this
place
he
said
that
beatrix
was
to
come
home
to
new
orleans
to
him
and
so
he
sent
me
to
escort
her
there
tell
me
where
is
she
tell
her
to
come
to
me
i
want
beatrix
i
want
beatrix
you
will
never
get
her
lynne
breath
was
coming
thick
and
fast
her
pale
eyes
scintillated
her
hands
were
clinching
each
other
convulsively
you
will
never
see
beatrix
dane
again
she
panted
shall
i
tell
you
why
she
has
left
us
forever
gone
away
to
be
married
she
is
married
by
this
time
she
went
away
leaving
you
lying
here
upon
this
in
vain
i
begged
her
to
remain
for
a
time
with
poor
serena
and
myself
and
help
nurse
you
but
she
only
laughed
and
said
that
she
could
not
alter
her
plans
and
postpone
her
marriage
for
the
sake
of
a
stranger
i
tell
you
she
is
gone
gone
forever
keith
and
she
is
married
to
a
wealthy
man
who
is
able
to
take
good
care
of
her
put
her
out
of
your
mind
at
once
she
is
not
worthy
a
kindly
thought
from
you
but
he
only
moaned
over
and
over
again
weakly
brokenly
i
want
beatrix
beatrix
my
beautiful
beatrix
until
lynne
felt
that
she
should
go
mad
he
had
relapsed
into
delirium
again
and
the
worst
was
before
them
days
went
by
and
it
was
a
fight
with
death
and
away
in
that
distant
southern
city
old
bernard
dane
waited
impatiently
for
his
recovery
and
return
the
only
news
received
by
him
being
the
telegrams
which
lynne
sent
him
almost
daily
their
import
was
always
the
same
no
better
but
the
day
came
at
last
when
weak
and
feeble
as
a
newborn
babe
keith
kenyon
struggled
back
to
existence
once
more
and
the
first
person
upon
whom
his
eyes
rested
was
serena
lynne
constant
watching
and
the
cares
of
the
had
not
improved
her
appearance
she
was
more
sallow
and
gaunt
and
unlovely
than
ever
his
eyes
wandered
slowly
over
the
grim
figure
and
smileless
face
and
he
strove
to
speak
lynne
he
said
softly
firmly
believing
that
the
woman
seated
at
his
bedside
was
the
mother
instead
of
the
daughter
serena
started
and
an
ugly
frown
disfigured
her
face
lynne
is
not
here
she
returned
curtly
it
is
i
serena
you
do
not
see
well
keith
a
slow
smile
stole
over
his
lips
he
held
out
one
feeble
hand
i
i
beg
your
pardon
i
am
sure
he
said
the
smile
lighting
up
his
wasted
face
like
a
ray
of
sunlight
i
am
so
grateful
to
you
serena
he
said
softly
under
god
i
owe
my
life
to
you
she
fell
upon
her
knees
at
the
bedside
i
would
not
have
cared
to
live
if
you
had
died
she
sobbed
bitterly
oh
keith
keith
you
are
the
very
light
of
my
life
say
that
you
care
a
little
even
a
little
for
me
his
face
grew
pallid
and
an
awful
faintness
crept
over
him
of
course
i
care
serena
he
faltered
brokenly
you
are
like
a
a
sister
to
me
but
i
do
not
want
to
be
your
sister
she
cried
boldly
let
me
be
something
nearer
and
dearer
keith
let
me
she
stopped
short
with
a
cry
of
horror
he
had
fainted
dead
away
and
lay
back
upon
the
pillow
as
white
as
a
corpse
with
a
wild
shriek
and
crying
out
madly
that
he
was
dead
she
summoned
her
mother
and
together
they
finally
resuscitated
him
but
he
was
as
weak
and
feeble
as
a
living
man
could
be
should
there
be
a
second
relapse
no
human
power
could
save
him
when
at
last
he
had
fallen
into
a
refreshing
slumber
lynne
beckoned
serena
out
into
the
hall
if
you
have
any
hope
of
ever
becoming
keith
kenyon
she
began
in
a
dry
hard
tone
i
advise
you
to
secure
him
as
soon
as
possible
marry
him
as
he
lies
upon
that
or
if
that
be
inexpedient
make
him
enter
into
an
engagement
to
marry
you
i
know
keith
kenyon
an
engagement
would
be
as
sacred
in
his
eyes
as
marriage
itself
do
your
best
serena
if
you
fail
to
grasp
this
opportunity
you
are
lost
how
can
you
ever
content
yourself
to
drag
out
your
days
here
in
this
place
with
only
a
pittance
to
live
on
with
no
pleasures
no
society
nothing
in
the
whole
world
but
an
endless
and
wearisome
round
of
distasteful
duties
no
happiness
no
love
and
you
love
keith
kenyon
do
you
not
serena
love
him
oh
my
god
she
sank
into
a
seat
and
covered
her
face
with
her
trembling
hands
while
a
torrent
of
sobs
shook
her
angular
frame
love
him
her
hands
fell
helplessly
to
her
side
and
the
face
and
eyes
swollen
and
dim
with
weeping
met
her
mother
sympathetic
gaze
lynne
had
little
sympathy
with
such
weakness
but
serena
was
her
daughter
her
only
child
and
the
mother
heart
jealous
over
her
offspring
was
sore
for
her
daughter
sorrow
love
him
repeated
serena
wildly
i
only
live
for
him
i
could
not
exist
without
him
believe
me
mother
this
is
no
exaggeration
if
i
could
not
see
keith
kenyon
and
be
with
him
sometimes
i
should
die
her
mother
thin
lip
curled
contemptuously
but
a
glance
into
the
eyes
and
face
full
of
keenest
suffering
and
the
and
which
are
almost
divine
were
in
the
ascendent
once
more
bah
love
is
only
madness
but
since
you
love
him
in
this
mad
way
serena
shall
marry
the
words
were
low
and
fervent
it
was
as
though
that
woman
had
been
suddenly
and
mysteriously
endowed
with
the
gift
of
prophecy
would
the
prophecy
come
to
pass
time
alone
would
tell
the
days
went
slowly
by
and
keith
grew
daily
stronger
and
better
one
evening
when
serena
was
sitting
beside
the
sofa
to
which
he
had
at
last
been
promoted
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
stifled
sob
and
turning
his
head
found
that
she
was
weeping
bitterly
he
was
still
very
weak
and
feeble
and
the
sight
of
her
emotion
fairly
unmanned
him
serena
serena
he
cried
frantically
for
heaven
sake
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
are
you
in
trouble
she
lifted
her
pale
face
and
eyes
i
am
in
the
worst
trouble
that
could
happen
to
a
woman
she
faltered
it
sounds
shameful
and
unwomanly
to
confess
it
to
you
keith
but
but
i
have
come
to
dread
the
time
like
death
when
you
will
go
away
from
us
go
away
from
me
forever
and
leave
me
here
to
a
dreadful
fate
my
heart
is
breaking
with
its
sorrow
for
i
have
loved
you
all
my
life
and
i
love
you
now
so
dearly
that
the
thought
of
not
seeing
you
gives
me
the
greatest
pain
that
i
have
ever
known
i
did
not
know
that
a
human
heart
suffer
so
and
yet
beat
on
keith
must
i
give
you
up
will
you
not
try
to
love
me
a
little
and
some
time
in
the
future
let
me
be
your
wife
i
would
be
such
a
good
wife
keith
such
a
good
kind
devoted
wife
i
would
be
willing
to
lay
my
life
down
to
give
you
a
moment
happiness
i
would
live
for
you
die
for
you
keith
believe
me
i
would
make
you
happy
for
i
would
sacrifice
my
every
hope
here
and
hereafter
to
that
end
and
you
would
never
regret
marrying
me
his
eyes
dark
and
dilated
were
fixed
upon
her
eager
face
with
a
slow
wonder
in
their
dusky
depths
he
had
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
as
serena
lynne
lavishing
such
a
wealth
of
affection
upon
himself
it
did
not
make
his
heart
thrill
with
ecstacy
to
think
of
it
now
i
i
do
not
understand
you
he
faltered
brokenly
manlike
trying
to
gain
time
by
evasion
i
i
it
is
quite
impossible
serena
quite
her
eyes
flashed
with
an
ominous
light
if
you
are
thinking
of
beatrix
dane
she
cried
angrily
you
are
only
wasting
your
time
and
committing
a
sin
she
is
another
man
wife
keith
kenyon
you
can
never
be
anything
to
her
and
serena
never
dreamed
that
the
uncle
bernard
with
whom
keith
kenyon
lived
his
uncle
only
by
adoption
was
the
bernard
dane
who
had
sent
for
beatrix
to
come
to
his
home
lynne
and
her
daughter
both
had
placed
no
credence
in
assertion
that
he
had
been
sent
thither
to
escort
the
girl
to
her
new
home
they
looked
upon
that
as
a
vagary
of
delirium
serena
urged
her
own
cause
until
the
poor
young
man
brain
weakened
by
his
long
and
dangerous
illness
grew
too
confused
to
grasp
the
situation
or
to
realize
what
he
was
doing
and
the
day
came
at
length
when
keith
kenyon
worn
out
and
weakened
in
mind
and
body
until
he
was
as
feeble
in
judgment
as
a
child
gave
an
unwilling
consent
to
make
serena
lynne
his
wife
that
very
day
a
telegram
arrived
for
him
from
new
orleans
short
and
concise
as
telegrams
usually
are
it
bade
him
return
home
at
once
if
he
was
able
to
travel
for
his
uncle
had
been
stricken
down
and
lay
at
the
point
of
death
chapter
viii
a
strange
command
life
had
seemed
strange
to
beatrix
in
that
gloomy
mansion
in
the
crescent
city
from
the
night
of
her
arrival
she
had
scarcely
seen
old
bernard
dane
a
circumstance
which
she
could
not
regret
for
try
as
she
might
to
shut
her
eyes
to
the
truth
there
was
nothing
pleasant
or
lovable
about
the
old
man
he
was
indeed
everything
repulsive
and
his
strange
wild
outbursts
of
rage
and
malice
against
some
evil
which
he
could
not
prevent
or
forget
something
hidden
away
in
his
own
past
made
beatrix
tremble
with
terror
she
shrank
from
the
gaze
of
his
shifting
dark
eyes
preternaturally
bright
with
some
hidden
fire
which
made
them
appear
like
fierce
flames
ready
to
burst
forth
and
devour
her
since
the
evening
of
her
arrival
she
had
never
again
attempted
any
familiar
or
affectionate
demonstrations
she
had
kept
at
a
respectful
distance
and
comprehended
fully
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
any
friendliness
between
them
why
had
he
sent
for
her
to
come
to
his
home
only
to
treat
her
with
chilling
coldness
or
outbursts
of
ungovernable
rage
when
she
thought
of
the
oath
that
he
had
extorted
from
her
her
solemn
promise
to
wed
the
man
whom
he
had
selected
as
her
husband
beatrix
heart
grew
faint
and
chill
with
horror
how
did
she
know
but
that
she
had
pledged
herself
to
a
fearful
fate
a
dark
an
awful
future
bound
to
a
man
whom
she
might
hate
at
first
sight
and
then
she
thought
of
keith
kenyon
and
her
heart
grew
warm
and
tender
could
she
ever
forget
him
even
though
she
might
never
see
him
again
was
it
possible
for
her
to
shut
her
heart
against
the
sweet
thoughts
which
would
intrude
the
few
tender
words
that
he
had
spoken
and
above
all
the
light
in
his
beautiful
dark
eyes
which
had
thrilled
her
to
the
heart
i
can
not
forget
him
she
would
say
over
and
over
when
the
unpleasant
recollection
of
the
oath
that
she
had
so
blindly
taken
would
come
back
to
her
memory
i
can
not
forget
him
and
there
will
be
no
use
in
trying
uncle
bernard
may
force
me
into
a
dreadful
marriage
if
he
sees
fit
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
obey
him
the
old
tyrant
but
i
shall
never
forget
keith
kenyon
as
long
as
i
live
never
the
great
gloomy
old
mansion
was
well
worth
exploring
for
it
was
like
the
houses
of
which
one
reads
in
romances
where
some
dark
mystery
seems
to
be
hidden
away
secure
from
the
light
of
day
and
prying
curious
eyes
there
was
one
room
called
the
beatrix
went
there
every
day
impelled
by
a
strange
and
unaccountable
fascination
to
sit
alone
and
wonder
over
and
over
again
for
what
use
the
room
had
been
originally
intended
it
was
reached
by
a
long
spiral
staircase
and
was
built
in
a
circular
shape
and
known
as
the
round
room
there
was
only
one
window
and
that
was
merely
a
small
square
hole
in
the
wall
and
was
covered
with
a
strong
iron
grating
for
what
purpose
had
this
room
been
intended
in
vain
did
beatrix
puzzle
her
brain
over
the
vexed
question
graves
the
old
housekeeper
looked
cold
and
when
beatrix
at
last
ventured
to
propound
the
question
i
really
can
not
tell
you
miss
dane
she
said
shaking
her
gray
head
slowly
and
solemnly
it
has
never
been
used
for
anything
since
i
have
been
in
the
dane
family
and
that
is
nearly
thirty
years
now
just
once
the
thin
lips
closed
down
tightly
together
and
she
turned
resolutely
away
as
though
to
give
beatrix
to
understand
that
the
tortures
of
the
inquisition
could
draw
forth
no
more
information
from
her
left
to
herself
beatrix
speculated
continually
upon
the
romance
which
she
felt
certain
must
be
connected
with
the
round
room
in
the
western
wing
she
reflected
so
much
upon
the
subject
and
it
grew
to
be
so
a
source
of
wonder
to
her
lonely
girlish
heart
that
one
day
she
made
up
her
mind
quite
bravely
to
seek
for
information
at
headquarters
that
very
day
accidentally
encountering
old
bernard
dane
in
the
great
entrance
hall
she
ventured
to
put
the
question
to
him
uncle
bernard
she
began
in
a
rather
shaky
voice
for
to
tell
the
truth
she
was
horribly
afraid
of
the
old
man
you
gave
me
permission
to
go
all
over
the
house
when
i
first
came
here
and
i
have
done
so
i
have
so
little
to
occupy
my
time
she
added
half
apologetically
it
has
interested
me
very
much
to
go
into
all
those
beautiful
rooms
but
i
would
like
to
ask
you
a
question
why
was
that
round
room
built
in
the
tower
for
what
purpose
was
it
intended
i
am
greatly
interested
and
would
like
to
know
she
stopped
short
awed
by
the
awful
look
in
his
eyes
and
the
strange
gray
shadow
which
had
settled
down
upon
his
face
not
a
word
was
spoken
for
some
minutes
he
stood
as
still
as
a
statue
one
hand
clutching
at
the
carved
back
of
a
gothic
hall
chair
with
such
force
that
one
of
the
elaborate
ornaments
snapped
off
in
his
grasp
the
round
room
eh
he
cried
in
a
harsh
croaking
voice
the
round
room
in
the
tower
ha
ha
you
have
been
there
then
i
ought
to
have
known
that
you
would
have
found
your
way
there
before
you
had
been
under
this
roof
hours
so
you
wish
to
know
for
what
purpose
the
round
room
was
designed
ah
miss
beatrix
dane
you
may
find
that
out
sooner
than
you
wish
and
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
will
drive
you
mad
in
the
long
black
nights
and
the
dreary
darksome
days
when
you
will
pray
for
death
and
find
it
not
then
you
will
learn
the
secret
which
is
mercifully
hidden
from
you
now
mercifully
ay
but
why
should
i
show
mercy
to
you
or
yours
mercy
who
has
ever
been
merciful
to
me
do
i
not
owe
it
to
your
accursed
race
that
i
am
what
i
am
ah
miss
beatrix
dane
ask
no
idle
questions
you
are
fated
to
know
for
what
purpose
that
room
was
built
to
know
in
good
time
do
touch
me
girl
for
she
had
ventured
to
lay
her
hand
upon
his
trembling
arm
do
dare
to
touch
me
or
i
will
strike
you
down
at
my
feet
the
very
touch
of
your
hands
is
pollution
she
drew
back
faint
and
shivering
as
though
he
had
indeed
dealt
her
a
blow
her
face
was
as
white
as
marble
her
dark
eyes
dilated
with
unutterable
horror
horror
too
deep
for
expression
what
was
this
fearful
secret
which
bernard
dane
held
over
her
head
continually
like
a
sword
what
effect
was
it
destined
to
have
upon
her
future
life
she
turned
away
faint
and
trembling
it
crept
into
her
mind
then
dawning
upon
her
with
a
strange
feeling
of
uneasiness
that
ever
since
her
arrival
at
the
old
mansion
she
had
been
treated
in
a
strangely
formal
way
a
sort
of
way
which
was
remarkable
to
say
the
least
her
room
was
in
a
remote
wing
of
the
building
everything
there
was
solely
for
her
own
use
set
apart
for
her
she
remembered
now
with
a
faint
sickness
creeping
over
her
heart
how
strangely
graves
had
watched
her
every
movement
did
they
suspect
that
she
was
going
mad
no
it
could
not
be
that
for
madness
is
not
contagious
and
the
precautions
with
which
she
was
surrounded
looked
greatly
as
though
some
contagion
was
feared
and
must
be
guarded
against
the
very
dishes
upon
which
she
ate
were
used
by
no
one
else
she
had
seen
graves
actually
strike
the
little
who
one
day
was
about
to
raise
to
her
lips
the
goblet
of
milk
from
which
beatrix
had
been
drinking
it
was
strange
and
mysterious
the
girl
turned
away
from
the
sight
of
the
wild
distorted
face
of
the
old
man
before
her
with
a
hopeless
feeling
tearing
at
her
she
went
slowly
back
to
her
own
room
and
sat
down
at
the
window
there
must
be
some
awful
curse
hanging
over
me
she
murmured
brokenly
i
can
not
imagine
what
this
strange
mystery
means
i
wish
i
could
find
out
i
wish
i
might
know
anything
is
better
than
suspense
alas
poor
beatrix
ignorance
was
certainly
bliss
in
her
case
if
only
she
could
have
known
it
the
day
would
come
when
she
would
look
back
upon
this
blissful
ignorance
and
curse
the
hour
when
first
she
had
heard
the
mystery
explained
that
very
night
old
bernard
dane
sent
for
beatrix
to
come
to
his
room
she
obeyed
the
summons
and
found
him
crouching
over
the
fire
looking
like
some
weird
priest
of
old
performing
an
incantation
come
here
he
commanded
harshly
lifting
his
head
and
transfixing
her
with
wild
eyes
as
the
girl
entered
the
room
come
here
beatrix
dane
put
your
hand
into
that
fire
right
into
the
flame
i
say
yes
you
must
do
it
you
swore
to
be
obedient
to
me
and
it
is
for
a
good
reason
that
i
wish
to
put
you
to
a
test
i
wish
to
prove
the
truth
of
course
you
think
me
mad
for
desiring
this
but
i
am
as
sane
as
you
are
this
is
a
test
i
tell
you
the
day
may
come
when
you
will
see
the
wisdom
of
my
words
come
you
must
obey
me
do
stand
staring
at
me
in
that
helpless
way
i
mean
what
i
say
and
i
will
be
obeyed
put
your
hand
in
the
fire
and
hold
it
there
quietly
for
a
moment
chapter
ix
just
in
time
beatrix
stood
staring
blankly
into
the
old
man
excited
face
with
a
strange
feeling
of
sickening
terror
creeping
over
her
heart
was
he
mad
in
heaven
name
what
did
he
mean
was
she
shut
up
alone
in
this
dreary
old
house
with
a
raving
madman
she
stood
there
trembling
like
a
leaf
quailing
before
the
steady
stare
of
his
wild
dark
eyes
burning
into
hers
with
a
look
of
awful
meaning
oh
uncle
bernard
she
faltered
at
length
striving
hard
to
steady
her
tremulous
voice
surely
you
do
not
mean
that
you
are
only
jesting
of
course
you
surely
could
not
mean
for
me
to
do
such
a
thing
such
an
thing
why
think
of
the
suffering
i
would
endure
the
pain
and
torture
and
do
ask
me
to
do
such
a
mad
thing
uncle
bernard
and
for
what
purpose
his
bloodshot
eyes
gleamed
with
a
curious
light
for
what
purpose
that
is
for
me
to
know
miss
beatrix
dane
i
have
already
told
you
that
this
is
a
test
a
test
of
you
will
ask
with
all
a
woman
curiosity
but
that
question
i
shall
not
now
answer
should
the
test
then
i
shall
be
at
liberty
to
tell
you
all
and
you
will
have
cause
to
be
grateful
beatrix
but
there
is
no
other
way
to
prove
the
truth
only
by
this
which
seems
so
absurd
to
you
you
must
try
and
be
brave
and
obey
me
beatrix
you
must
thrust
your
right
hand
into
the
flames
that
was
the
advice
of
the
physician
whom
i
consulted
you
can
induce
the
young
lady
to
put
her
hand
in
the
fire
so
doctor
de
trobriand
informed
me
will
soon
know
the
worst
if
the
thing
you
suspect
should
prove
to
be
true
then
but
there
beatrix
i
must
not
reveal
to
you
the
rest
of
the
opinion
that
is
a
professional
secret
do
you
still
refuse
i
do
beatrix
voice
was
stern
and
her
eyes
full
of
a
resolute
light
surely
the
man
before
her
was
a
lunatic
and
she
must
not
allow
him
to
intimidate
her
i
refuse
absolutely
she
repeated
bravely
your
command
is
not
reasonable
and
i
shall
not
obey
it
you
must
be
mad
uncle
bernard
to
expect
obedience
to
such
a
command
you
refuse
eh
he
started
to
his
feet
white
with
anger
remember
that
know
best
and
this
is
best
for
you
a
necessary
test
i
say
but
since
you
refuse
i
shall
be
compelled
to
use
force
he
seized
her
hands
and
dragged
her
forcibly
to
the
fireside
the
poor
girl
writhing
and
struggling
in
his
grasp
uncle
bernard
for
the
love
of
heaven
stop
she
pleaded
stop
and
think
what
you
are
doing
you
are
about
to
inflict
the
most
terrible
torture
upon
me
you
will
doubtless
maim
me
for
life
uncle
bernard
uncle
bernard
for
the
love
of
heaven
i
beg
of
you
to
stop
to
spare
me
please
please
the
sweet
voice
grew
weaker
and
fainter
as
the
old
man
forced
her
nearer
the
burning
coals
within
the
grate
in
his
eyes
the
fire
of
a
fiendish
purpose
his
face
as
white
as
marble
i
am
obliged
to
do
it
beatrix
he
said
in
a
low
ominous
voice
if
the
result
proves
satisfactory
i
shall
be
at
liberty
to
explain
the
mystery
to
you
and
then
you
will
know
the
unutterable
horror
that
you
have
escaped
if
the
fire
burns
you
that
the
fire
will
burn
you
beatrix
he
broke
off
wildly
pray
that
your
little
hand
may
be
scarred
for
all
time
rather
than
have
that
awful
curse
to
fall
upon
you
oh
yes
i
know
you
think
me
a
madman
but
listen
to
me
child
his
voice
softening
a
little
you
think
me
a
madman
a
brute
a
fiend
but
when
you
have
heard
the
truth
you
will
think
differently
i
have
sought
vengeance
all
my
life
but
somehow
your
piteous
eyes
and
helpless
loneliness
have
made
me
feel
a
little
kinder
and
if
it
were
not
for
keith
kenyon
and
the
debt
of
vengeance
that
i
owe
he
stopped
short
checking
himself
with
a
strange
gesture
as
though
he
regretted
having
spoken
so
freely
this
much
i
can
tell
you
beatrix
his
voice
had
fallen
almost
to
a
whisper
there
was
no
sound
to
break
the
awful
silence
of
the
room
save
old
bernard
dane
heavy
breathing
and
the
dropping
of
a
coal
in
the
grate
beatrix
stood
there
her
hands
crushed
in
his
iron
grasp
one
would
never
have
dreamed
that
the
old
man
was
so
strong
and
listened
eagerly
breathlessly
to
his
next
words
this
much
i
will
tell
you
he
went
on
slowly
and
after
you
have
heard
it
i
think
you
will
agree
with
me
yours
is
a
fearful
heritage
beatrix
an
heritage
of
woe
i
will
not
put
it
into
words
for
if
you
were
to
know
it
to
know
the
secret
of
your
own
dark
inheritance
it
would
kill
you
as
you
stand
there
before
me
beatrix
there
is
poison
in
your
very
an
awful
taint
suspected
which
can
only
be
proved
by
this
crucial
test
beatrix
obey
me
place
your
hand
in
yonder
fire
as
i
bid
you
if
it
comes
forth
burned
and
disfigured
a
mass
of
horrible
burns
and
unsightly
scars
your
body
racked
with
suffering
then
thank
your
god
upon
bended
knee
that
you
have
escaped
the
doom
of
your
race
if
on
the
other
hand
contact
with
the
fire
should
have
no
effect
upon
you
i
advise
you
young
and
fair
though
you
are
take
your
own
will
you
place
your
hand
in
the
flame
she
shrank
back
paling
and
shivering
i
can
not
she
faltered
i
hush
shall
you
with
a
swift
movement
he
dragged
her
close
to
the
fire
and
bending
her
slight
form
forward
was
about
to
lay
the
little
white
hand
upon
the
bed
of
live
coals
when
all
at
once
there
was
a
loud
peal
at
the
a
moment
later
before
old
dane
could
carry
out
his
horrible
intention
the
door
of
the
room
was
thrown
open
and
a
tall
form
bounded
over
the
threshold
one
swift
glance
and
the
newcomer
sprang
to
the
fireside
and
seizing
the
old
man
by
the
shoulder
forced
him
into
the
nearest
seat
then
before
bernard
dane
could
recover
from
the
shock
of
the
surprise
the
intruder
turned
and
faced
the
girl
beatrix
keith
keith
kenyon
face
was
pale
and
stern
and
his
dark
eyes
flashed
fire
so
he
cried
indignantly
i
come
home
in
answer
to
a
telegram
which
declares
you
to
be
at
the
point
of
death
bernard
dane
and
i
find
you
in
usual
health
and
in
the
very
midst
of
an
act
of
inhuman
torture
simons
told
me
what
was
going
on
as
soon
as
he
opened
the
door
to
me
i
rushed
up
here
at
once
just
in
time
it
seems
bernard
dane
i
demand
to
know
what
you
mean
by
such
inhuman
conduct
understand
me
if
ever
i
find
you
attempting
a
repetition
of
this
torture
i
shall
leave
you
forever
and
i
shall
take
beatrix
with
me
she
shall
not
remain
here
to
be
murdered
keep
your
money
bernard
dane
i
do
not
want
it
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
a
wicked
wretch
like
you
but
keith
the
old
man
quavered
the
name
forth
in
a
broken
voice
you
do
not
know
it
is
for
her
good
for
your
good
if
she
escapes
the
awful
doom
of
her
race
she
no
no
keith
i
must
not
tell
you
the
old
man
broke
down
and
buried
his
face
in
his
shaking
hands
a
pitiable
sight
keith
starting
up
suddenly
and
gazing
into
the
handsome
face
with
eyes
i
had
planned
a
marriage
between
you
two
but
but
it
must
never
be
it
would
be
sacrilege
a
crime
keith
kenyon
turned
and
his
dark
eyes
met
the
frightened
gaze
of
beatrix
what
was
that
which
he
read
in
those
timid
trusting
eyes
lifted
to
his
face
with
a
shy
look
was
it
love
with
a
low
cry
of
rapture
he
sprang
to
her
side
and
caught
the
slight
form
in
his
arms
beatrix
beatrix
he
whispered
passionately
we
have
not
long
known
each
other
but
i
love
you
i
think
i
have
loved
you
ever
since
our
first
meeting
when
you
risked
your
precious
life
to
save
mine
long
before
i
suspected
the
truth
that
you
were
the
young
girl
whom
i
was
sent
to
escort
to
this
place
this
cursed
place
where
i
wish
you
had
never
come

love

all
my
heart

my
wife

his
money

not
want
it
i
am
strong
and
can
work
for
us
both
say
yes
beatrix
darling
say
yes
for
surely
no
man
ever
loved
a
woman
as
i
love
you
and
then
he
stopped
short
and
his
heart
grew
faint
and
cold
within
his
breast
he
had
forgotten
that
he
was
serena
lynne
promised
husband
that
he
was
bound
in
honor
to
make
serena
lynne
his
wife
chapter
x
an
old
man
secret
yes
he
was
serena
lynne
betrothed
husband
and
bound
in
honor
to
make
her
his
wife
the
sharp
remembrance
cut
him
to
the
heart
like
a
sword
he
fell
back
with
a
cry
of
anguish
and
the
died
upon
his
lips
may
heaven
have
pity
he
groaned
i
had
forgotten
forgotten
look
at
me
with
such
piteous
eyes
beatrix
oh
beatrix
my
love
i
have
done
wrong
i
have
made
a
mistake
and
my
happiness
is
wrecked
all
my
life
is
ruined
and
darkened
forever
old
bernard
dane
hobbled
over
to
keith
side
and
laid
a
trembling
hand
upon
his
arm
keith
my
boy
i
i
ca
explain
this
to
you
he
mumbled
brokenly
he
had
not
observed
the
scene
which
had
just
taken
place
between
keith
and
the
shrinking
trembling
girl
who
stood
there
pale
as
a
lily
before
them
he
had
not
listened
to
keith
impassioned
avowal
he
had
been
deaf
and
unseeing
to
all
that
had
taken
place
keith
dark
eyes
flashed
with
an
angry
light
i
wish
no
explanation
he
returned
harshly
there
is
no
excuse
no
palliation
of
your
conduct
possible
you
have
acted
the
part
of
an
inhuman
monster
a
madman
yes
let
us
hope
that
temporary
aberration
is
responsible
for
your
strange
conduct
uncle
bernard
i
warn
you
that
if
your
attempt
to
torture
this
poor
girl
should
be
repeated
i
will
appeal
to
the
authorities
you
shall
be
confined
in
a
retreat
for
the
insane
you
are
a
dangerous
person
to
go
at
large
the
old
man
seemed
strangely
weakened
and
unmanned
he
uttered
no
word
no
sound
escaped
his
dry
parched
lips
but
upon
his
wrinkled
face
there
was
a
look
of
abject
terror
trembling
like
a
leaf
he
turned
and
leaning
heavily
upon
his
cane
passed
from
the
room
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
he
went
straight
to
the
library
a
great
apartment
filled
with
and
with
a
huge
escritoire
standing
beside
a
window
the
old
man
hobbled
over
to
the
desk
and
taking
a
bunch
of
keys
from
his
pocket
he
unlocked
the
desk
and
turned
to
a
small
drawer
at
the
right
from
this
drawer
he
removed
a
small
package
of
old
letters
tied
with
a
narrow
black
ribbon
removing
the
ribbon
he
began
to
examine
the
letters
reading
them
over
hastily
one
by
one
the
frown
upon
his
brow
growing
deeper
his
dark
eyes
flashing
with
an
angry
light
when
he
had
read
the
last
of
the
letters
he
replaced
the
somber
ribbon
and
returned
the
package
to
the
drawer
then
bowing
his
head
upon
his
hand
bernard
dane
sat
buried
in
profound
thought
whatever
the
subject
that
engrossed
his
thoughts
it
was
not
a
pleasant
one
that
could
be
easily
seen
by
the
lines
of
care
upon
his
brow
the
furrows
of
anxiety
the
evidence
of
a
great
trouble
that
were
plainly
written
upon
his
face
a
look
of
intense
anger
settled
down
upon
it
he
clinched
his
white
hands
fiercely
and
the
deep
dark
eyes
gleamed
like
fire
to
think
of
it
all
he
muttered
harshly
all
that
i
have
borne
for
long
years
the
horror
the
agony
of
it
to
think
of
the
woman
i
loved
who
duped
me
deceived
me
made
a
mock
of
me
but
i
canceled
the
account
between
us
and
wiped
out
the
score
he
went
on
with
a
fiendish
chuckle
rubbing
his
hands
together
as
he
spoke
i
paid
her
back
word
for
word
blow
for
blow
when
i
remember
when
i
think
of
that
i
i
feel
amply
satisfied
for
all
the
suffering
she
caused
me
she
suffered
fourfold
and
was
it
not
almost
miraculous
that
the
man
who
won
her
away
from
me
the
man
who
had
been
my
best
friend
who
had
deceived
me
and
fooled
me
to
the
top
of
my
bent
in
short
guy
kenyon
himself
should
have
been
placed
in
my
hands
at
my
mercy
he
never
realized
the
bliss
that
would
have
been
his
his
cup
of
happiness
was
snatched
from
his
grasp
before
he
could
raise
it
to
his
lips
for
she
she
ha
ha
and
no
one
knows
no
one
but
old
bernard
dane
will
ever
know
how
and
where
she
died
poor
child
after
all
these
long
years
can
it
be
that
has
come
to
life
within
this
hardened
old
heart
of
mine
but
i
can
not
help
it
when
i
remember
how
they
forced
her
into
an
unholy
marriage
with
that
old
man
but
still
there
were
compensations
for
when
her
babe
was
six
months
old
he
departed
this
life
leaving
all
his
worldly
possessions
to
his
beautiful
young
widow
and
her
infant
child
then
guy
kenyon
a
widower
with
one
son
came
to
the
fore
with
his
handsome
face
and
winning
ways
she
had
known
him
and
cared
for
him
previous
to
her
marriage
with
old
godfrey
dane
and
it
did
not
take
long
to
revive
old
feeling
to
warm
over
the
ashes
of
the
old
love
from
which
the
new
arose
like
a
phenix
married
or
single
bound
or
free
it
was
all
the
same
she
never
cared
for
me
and
guy
kenyon
would
have
wedded
her
if
fate
had
not
interfered
fate
in
the
person
of
old
bernard
dane
ha
ha
bernard
dane
but
not
so
old
and
ugly
then
as
he
is
now
appeared
and
in
his
possession
proof
positive
of
the
awful
curse
which
rested
upon
her
upon
mildred
dane
he
loved
her
there
was
no
doubt
upon
that
score
he
loved
her
and
the
knowledge
of
this
fearful
curse
which
rested
upon
the
woman
he
loved
him
he
did
not
long
survive
the
fearful
knowledge
of
her
secret
then
came
the
grand
i
placed
his
child
keith
then
a
boy
of
ten
or
eleven
in
the
care
of
respectable
people
after
which
i
turned
my
attention
to
to
mildred
i
had
sworn
that
she
should
be
my
wife
or
nobody
but
even
i
with
all
my
great
love
for
her
could
not
dared
not
make
her
my
wife
with
the
knowledge
of
that
fearful
that
hideous
curse
hanging
over
her
like
a
pall
i
do
not
like
to
recall
that
time
the
old
man
went
on
wearily
pushing
back
the
scanty
locks
from
his
wrinkled
brow
she
was
like
a
mad
creature
when
she
learned
the
truth
when
i
told
her
all
poor
heartbroken
mildred
she
swore
that
she
would
take
her
own
life
and
she
kept
her
oath
ah
well
a
fearful
shudder
convulsing
his
frame
it
is
an
awful
thing
to
reflect
upon
but
i
could
not
blame
any
living
creature
and
above
all
a
young
and
beautiful
woman
for
committing
suicide
under
those
circumstances
i
risked
my
own
life
in
keeping
near
her
as
i
did
but
my
heart
was
heavy
for
her
sake
and
i
could
not
leave
her
to
meet
her
awful
doom
alone
and
in
return
for
my
she
hated
me
defied
me
died
without
one
word
of
kindness
to
me
name
guy
kenyon
was
the
last
upon
her
lips
was
it
not
enough
to
harden
a
man
heart
against
a
woman
to
whom
he
had
given
all
to
whom
he
had
dedicated
his
whole
life
her
cruelty
to
me
hardened
my
heart
against
her
living
and
dead
ay
i
even
grew
to
hate
her
memory
i
fell
upon
my
knees
and
swore
by
every
thing
holy
that
i
would
be
avenged
after
that
as
the
years
rolled
by
and
i
hated
mildred
dane
very
memory
even
as
i
had
long
hated
guy
kenyon
hated
him
living
hated
him
dead
i
finally
planned
this
marriage
between
the
two
descendants
of
the
man
and
the
woman
whom
i
hated
it
is
a
fiendish
plot
i
look
upon
in
his
noble
manly
beauty
his
true
warm
heart
and
honorable
nature
i
look
upon
with
her
beautiful
face
so
like
that
other
face
once
loved
but
now
in
death
and
something
in
the
girl
piteous
eyes
makes
my
heart
quail
i
am
not
altogether
a
demon
and
i
am
sick
sick
of
the
whole
plot
that
girl
eyes
they
are
mildred
own
just
as
she
used
to
look
when
she
was
a
sweet
young
girl
before
they
sold
her
to
godfrey
dane
for
money
i
can
not
shut
out
the
look
of
appeal
in
beatrix
eyes
it
makes
my
heart
ache
hard
and
cruel
and
bitter
though
it
is
i
pity
her
i
pity
him
i
see
my
own
error
now
when
oh
god
it
is
too
late
for
they
love
each
other
i
would
do
anything
in
my
power
to
prevent
the
marriage
between
them
now
but
they
are
young
headstrong
and
i
shall
fail
in
my
attempt
then
oh
heavens
above
the
very
thought
of
what
must
come
of
what
looms
up
before
them
in
the
dark
future
makes
me
sick
and
faint
i
have
sought
the
best
medical
advice
in
the
country
doctor
de
trobriand
whose
specialty
is
this
particular
horror
that
threatens
poor
beatrix
life
has
told
me
that
the
fire
test
is
the
only
possible
test
of
which
he
knows
he
advised
me
to
attempt
it
but
the
girl
refused
i
could
not
explain
to
her
and
tell
her
why
i
made
so
seemingly
absurd
and
cruel
a
request
of
her
i
dared
not
tell
her
my
suspicions
my
reasons
for
making
this
request
the
knowledge
would
drive
her
mad
and
i
have
failed
in
the
attempt
as
i
have
failed
in
everything
else
all
my
life
long
curses
upon
it
he
rose
slowly
to
his
feet
and
relocked
the
escritoire
and
then
with
slow
unsteady
steps
he
returned
to
his
own
room
beatrix
had
gone
but
keith
was
sitting
alone
before
the
fire
his
face
pale
and
stern
his
eyes
full
of
sadness
the
old
man
crept
to
his
side
like
a
penitent
keith
my
boy
you
will
forgive
me
he
quavered
what
i
did
was
for
your
good
and
hers
listen
to
me
keith
you
will
give
up
this
marriage
this
mad
marriage
i
i
had
always
intended
you
two
to
wed
each
other
for
that
purpose
i
have
brought
you
together
but
since
since
i
have
lived
under
the
same
roof
with
that
child
my
heart
is
melted
somehow
and
i
can
not
consent
to
the
awful
sacrifice
you
do
know
keith
you
do
know
what
a
fearful
fate
is
in
store
for
you
if
you
persist
in
this
mad
marriage
forget
that
i
had
ever
planned
it
forget
beatrix
dane
i
can
not
i
will
not
i
love
her
your
warning
comes
too
late
uncle
bernard
the
old
man
bowed
his
head
upon
his
clasped
hands
and
a
fearful
shudder
crept
over
his
gaunt
frame
it
was
all
his
own
fault
all
the
result
of
his
own
mad
folly
his
own
hands
would
now
overthrow
the
fabric
which
he
had
patiently
reared
but
it
was
too
late
and
only
desolation
remained
surely
bernard
dane
was
undergoing
a
strange
transformation
the
result
of
contact
with
a
pure
young
being
like
beatrix
dane
the
great
sad
dark
eyes
which
gazed
so
pleadingly
into
his
face
had
made
the
old
sinner
ashamed
of
himself
he
saw
for
the
first
time
in
the
clear
light
of
reason
his
own
wickedness
and
his
soul
shrank
back
ashamed
how
could
he
ever
have
formed
so
vile
a
plot
such
a
diabolical
scheme
to
entrap
two
innocent
people
to
wreck
and
destroy
two
young
lives
keith
kenyon
felt
no
pity
for
him
he
never
dreamed
the
full
iniquity
of
that
which
bernard
dane
had
plotted
to
do
but
the
fact
that
he
had
plotted
in
some
way
that
he
had
thrown
keith
himself
and
beatrix
together
only
to
sever
the
ties
between
them
now
seemingly
to
gratify
a
foolish
whim
of
his
own
made
the
young
man
heart
grow
hard
as
steel
within
his
breast
and
a
cold
chill
of
horror
crept
over
him
he
felt
disgusted
with
the
whole
world
and
with
old
bernard
dane
in
particular
had
he
known
the
worst
the
full
extent
of
bernard
dane
crime
he
would
have
fled
from
the
house
that
very
night
in
horror
and
would
never
willingly
have
looked
upon
the
old
man
face
again
he
rose
and
stood
leaning
against
the
carved
marble
mantel
i
am
very
sorry
uncle
bernard
he
said
in
a
low
resolute
tone
but
i
beatrix
and
i
intend
to
make
her
my
wife
i
will
surmount
every
obstacle
in
the
way
but
she
shall
be
my
wife
sir
he
turned
swiftly
and
left
the
room
in
haste
as
though
determined
to
prevent
any
further
remonstrance
up
in
his
own
chamber
he
walked
straight
over
to
his
he
had
made
up
his
mind
what
to
do
and
the
sooner
the
disagreeable
task
was
performed
was
over
and
done
with
the
better
i
will
do
it
at
once
he
muttered
resolutely
delays
are
dangerous
and
besides
i
shall
be
in
a
fever
of
impatience
for
the
answer
how
terrible
it
will
be
to
wait
for
it
two
whole
weeks
fourteen
endless
days
before
i
can
hope
to
hear
from
her
in
reply
i
will
write
to
her
at
once
write
to
serena
lynne
and
confess
all
and
beg
her
to
release
me
it
was
an
absurd
engagement
at
best
a
wrong
a
wicked
engagement
for
i
do
not
love
her
i
have
never
cared
for
her
i
shall
never
care
for
her
though
i
live
to
be
one
hundred
good
heavens
the
very
idea
in
connection
with
is
ridiculous
grotesque
once
broken
off
the
engagement
will
soon
fade
from
her
memory
and
she
will
turn
her
attention
to
some
more
suitable
and
worthy
object
than
your
humble
servant
she
will
not
dare
not
refuse
to
release
me
he
cried
softly
an
awful
thought
crossing
his
heart
like
a
cold
slimy
serpent
she
would
not
be
a
woman
with
a
woman
heart
if
she
refuses
to
grant
it
alas
poor
keith
he
did
not
know
he
did
not
realize
that
when
a
woman
like
serena
lynne
loves
her
heart
hardens
against
all
other
women
the
very
love
in
her
heart
crystallizes
she
will
fight
for
that
love
sin
for
it
die
for
it
but
she
will
never
give
it
up
never
while
she
lives
chapter
xi
serena
first
love
letter
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
serena
lynne
was
triumphant
with
the
knowledge
of
a
victory
won
she
had
begun
to
despair
the
prospect
of
ever
winning
keith
kenyon
had
been
growing
small
by
degrees
and
beautifully
less
now
flickering
up
in
a
wild
spasmodic
hope
of
success
then
sinking
down
below
zero
once
more
when
she
had
discovered
his
evident
too
evident
interest
in
beatrix
the
woman
heart
had
swelled
with
bitter
indignation
and
resentment
and
for
a
time
it
had
seemed
to
serena
lynne
that
there
was
no
alternative
but
to
die
and
escape
it
all
the
anguish
was
unendurable
for
with
all
the
strength
of
her
selfish
nature
she
loved
keith
kenyon
and
the
very
thought
of
giving
up
all
hope
of
winning
him
was
more
bitter
than
death
but
at
last
she
had
succeeded
not
in
winning
his
love
but
himself
there
was
a
vast
difference
but
serena
did
not
pause
to
reflect
upon
that
point
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
marry
keith
kenyon
the
sooner
the
marriage
was
over
with
and
he
was
hers
until
death
should
part
them
the
better
for
her
she
sought
her
mother
after
the
momentous
interview
with
keith
a
look
of
excitement
and
delight
upon
her
face
her
pale
eyes
flashing
with
rapture
lynne
glanced
up
from
the
work
upon
which
she
was
engaged
and
a
look
of
inquiry
flashed
into
her
eyes
well
serena
has
anything
remarkable
occurred
she
asked
tersely
serena
threw
herself
down
upon
the
faded
sofa
and
clasped
her
thin
hands
in
an
affected
attitude
mamma
in
a
low
tone
as
though
she
feared
that
some
one
would
overhear
the
wonderful
news
which
she
was
just
dying
to
tell
keith
kenyon
has
asked
me
has
has
promised
to
marry
me
a
look
of
incredulous
surprise
flashed
into
lynne
pale
blue
eyes
the
swift
blood
dyed
her
cheek
a
sullen
crimson
for
a
moment
then
faded
slowly
away
leaving
her
as
sallow
and
uninteresting
as
before
serena
she
exclaimed
in
a
tremulous
voice
do
be
a
goose
allow
yourself
to
be
misled
by
your
own
wishes
or
to
overestimate
trifles
polite
fibs
or
foolish
nothings
in
which
some
men
indulge
and
which
mean
less
than
nothing
what
foolishness
can
keith
have
been
saying
to
you
that
you
should
imagine
that
he
wants
to
marry
you
serena
why
it
is
as
plain
that
he
is
in
love
with
beatrix
he
will
never
propose
to
you
serena
never
in
the
world
while
beatrix
dane
lives
and
if
he
finds
out
that
she
is
still
single
serena
tossed
her
head
all
the
same
he
has
done
so
she
cried
at
least
he
i
led
him
on
you
know
mamma
it
was
the
only
way
and
so
he
said
at
last
serena
if
you
are
willing
to
accept
me
without
any
question
of
love
i
ask
you
to
be
my
wife
and
you
had
better
believe
that
i
did
not
wait
long
before
i
clinched
the
matter
with
a
she
added
coarsely
so
mamma
you
need
not
trouble
your
head
any
more
in
regard
to
my
future
i
shall
be
all
right
when
i
am
keith
kenyon
and
in
my
handsome
home
in
new
orleans
i
will
just
in
southern
society
and
make
these
new
orleans
women
turn
green
with
envy
to
think
that
he
should
pass
by
all
the
young
ladies
of
the
south
to
find
a
wife
in
old
massachusetts
will
seem
a
strange
thing
to
the
southern
people
i
shall
put
on
a
great
deal
of
style
and
just
overawe
them
i
am
as
good
as
the
best
of
them
am
i
not
miss
lynne
only
daughter
of
the
late
illustrious
and
eminent
physician
doctor
frederick
lynne
of
chester
massachusetts
and
as
keith
kenyon
i
imagine
my
position
in
the
fashionable
world
will
be
assured
oh
mamma
i
am
perfectly
happy
poor
serena
her
happiness
was
very
much
like
the
house
of
which
the
new
testament
tells
us
which
was
founded
upon
the
sand
and
when
the
rains
descended
and
the
floods
came
it
fell
and
great
was
the
fall
thereof
lynne
said
very
little
upon
the
subject
there
seemed
a
sort
of
insecurity
in
this
projected
marriage
which
rendered
her
uncertain
in
regard
to
it
she
shut
her
thin
lips
tightly
together
and
went
on
with
her
work
and
no
more
was
said
for
the
present
then
came
the
telegram
for
keith
which
old
bernard
dane
had
sent
himself
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
keith
was
not
half
as
ill
as
he
had
believed
himself
and
that
if
something
was
not
done
to
rouse
him
to
a
sense
of
his
duty
he
might
linger
on
in
that
northern
clime
indefinitely
but
perhaps
the
strangest
point
in
this
game
of
was
this
lynne
and
serena
never
once
dreamed
or
suspected
that
beatrix
was
under
the
same
roof
where
keith
was
going
that
the
same
house
sheltered
her
which
was
home
to
him
they
had
paid
no
heed
to
the
address
in
the
letter
which
had
been
found
in
doctor
lynne
dead
hand
and
the
remittances
for
beatrix
had
always
been
forwarded
from
new
orleans
by
dane
lawyer
and
owing
to
keith
illness
ever
since
he
had
been
under
the
roof
of
the
lynnes
they
had
never
known
or
inquired
in
regard
to
the
old
man
who
had
adopted
him
not
even
his
name
or
address
even
the
telegrams
which
reported
keith
condition
were
sent
to
the
housekeeper
graves
it
was
a
strange
complication
and
out
of
this
misunderstanding
all
the
future
evil
was
fated
to
come
old
bernard
dane
had
begun
to
feel
strangely
uneasy
in
regard
to
keith
long
absence
so
at
last
the
sham
telegram
was
sent
and
brought
about
the
desired
result
in
keith
sudden
return
but
the
long
journey
following
so
close
upon
his
severe
illness
proved
almost
too
much
for
his
strength
and
the
selfish
old
man
was
compelled
to
acknowledge
that
he
had
made
an
imprudent
move
for
the
day
after
his
arrival
home
keith
was
unable
to
leave
his
bed
and
for
a
week
was
quite
an
invalid
but
at
the
expiration
of
that
time
he
was
able
to
come
and
began
at
once
to
look
for
an
answer
to
his
letter
to
serena
which
he
had
written
the
night
of
his
arrival
home
in
the
meantime
in
the
old
brown
house
in
the
massachusetts
wilderness
serena
lynne
had
been
publishing
far
and
near
the
news
of
her
engagement
the
great
and
glorious
news
of
her
engagement
to
the
rich
young
southerner
all
the
neighbors
for
miles
around
were
regaled
with
accounts
of
his
splendid
home
in
new
orleans
of
his
vast
wealth
and
high
social
position
the
rich
old
uncle
she
forgot
to
explain
that
keith
was
an
adopted
heir
who
would
bequeath
his
immense
fortune
to
keith
when
he
died
and
in
short
serena
painted
her
own
future
prospects
in
glowing
colors
until
the
country
girls
with
whom
serena
affiliated
were
half
wild
with
envious
jealousy
and
wondered
openly
among
themselves
what
any
man
in
his
sober
senses
could
see
in
that
ugly
serena
lynne
to
admire
and
more
than
all
to
marry
and
the
verdict
was
rendered
unanimously
that
keith
kenyon
lady
acquaintances
must
be
few
in
number
i
shall
have
a
grand
wedding
mamma
serena
announced
confidently
at
breakfast
one
morning
a
breakfast
served
in
slovenly
fashion
and
partaken
of
by
the
two
ladies
attired
in
slatternly
morning
costumes
of
course
so
soon
after
papa
death
went
on
the
irrepressible
serena
i
can
not
make
a
very
grand
display
but
i
mean
to
be
married
in
april
and
i
shall
go
as
far
with
my
wedding
festivities
as
i
dare
venture
to
under
the
circumstances
i
mean
to
have
a
wedding
that
will
eclipse
any
other
that
has
ever
been
heard
of
here
all
our
old
acquaintances
in
fact
everybody
in
the
whole
country
of
any
importance
shall
be
invited
we
will
have
the
church
decorated
with
flowers
and
ferns
and
spare
no
expense
i
shall
send
to
boston
for
my
really
i
could
not
wear
anything
from
this
little
place
you
know
mamma
and
besides
we
owe
old
grey
such
a
fearful
bill
i
will
have
white
brocade
silk
embroidered
with
silver
flowers
and
i
must
secure
a
wreath
of
real
out
of
compliment
to
keith
you
know
he
comes
from
the
land
of
we
will
order
a
from
boston
and
and
when
do
you
expect
to
hear
from
keith
interposed
lynne
dryly
she
had
had
a
few
hurried
words
with
the
young
man
before
his
departure
just
enough
to
rivet
the
chains
securely
serena
sallow
face
flushed
i
i
do
know
soon
though
i
suppose
and
by
the
way
mamma
there
is
rogers
now
at
the
gate
i
believe
actually
believe
that
he
has
mail
for
us
perhaps
it
is
a
letter
from
keith
she
pushed
back
her
chair
and
without
waiting
for
a
wrap
rushed
eagerly
out
into
the
cold
wintry
air
out
to
the
gate
outside
of
which
kindly
old
rogers
had
halted
letters
miss
serena
yes
to
be
sure
one
for
your
ma
and
one
for
you
that
from
your
sweetheart
down
in
new
orleans
i
see
serena
tried
her
very
best
to
call
up
a
blush
but
the
sallow
skin
did
not
warm
and
only
the
air
bit
the
end
of
the
long
sharp
nose
until
it
was
purple
she
seized
the
letters
and
with
a
shower
of
voluble
thanks
hastened
back
to
the
house
like
a
mad
creature
back
to
her
seat
at
the
one
for
you
ma
she
announced
tossing
a
large
yellow
envelope
into
her
mother
lap
and
a
letter
for
me
from
keith
of
course
her
chilly
fingers
hurriedly
tore
open
the
envelope
the
letter
was
not
very
long
but
it
seemed
to
lynne
watching
her
daughter
with
eyes
that
it
took
serena
an
endless
time
to
decipher
its
contents
all
at
once
with
a
low
groan
crumpling
the
letter
fiercely
in
her
hand
serena
slipped
from
her
chair
and
lay
upon
the
floor
in
a
dead
faint

an
unpleasant
surprise
keith
kenyon
was
able
to
leave
his
room
once
more
and
rejoin
the
small
household
during
his
illness
beatrix
had
kept
to
her
own
room
as
much
as
possible
never
voluntarily
entering
the
presence
of
the
old
man
whom
she
feared
as
a
madman
his
wild
dark
eyes
would
follow
her
with
furtive
glances
he
seemed
secretly
watching
her
and
more
than
once
she
surprised
a
gleam
of
wild
intensity
as
he
seemed
to
devour
her
with
his
eyes
she
grew
pale
and
thin
and
nervous
and
all
the
time
her
heart
longed
for
keith
keith
with
his
tender
dark
eyes
and
sweet
low
voice
and
caressing
ways
keith
who
would
stand
between
her
and
all
she
kept
herself
as
much
as
possible
in
the
vicinity
of
the
and
waylaid
graves
upon
any
and
every
available
occasion
with
eager
anxious
inquiries
as
to
his
condition
to
all
of
which
graves
made
reluctant
replies
it
was
evident
that
she
did
not
at
all
approve
of
any
ties
of
interest
between
her
handsome
young
master
and
this
girl
with
the
sad
unfortunate
history
her
unguessed
secret
the
dark
inheritance
which
hung
over
her
like
a
deadly
curse
but
the
day
came
at
last
when
keith
was
able
to
make
his
way
slowly
and
wearily
and
into
the
where
he
sank
upon
a
comfortable
sofa
before
the
fire
and
uttered
a
sigh
of
relief
then
his
eyes
wandered
swiftly
around
the
room
as
though
seeking
some
one
where
is
miss
dane
he
asked
graves
frowned
up
in
her
own
room
to
be
sure
she
made
answer
and
if
you
please
keith
i
rather
think
that
dane
prefers
that
she
should
remain
there
remain
there
indeed
indignantly
and
pray
what
right
has
dane
or
anybody
else
to
attempt
to
imprison
miss
beatrix
dane
i
should
like
to
know
imprison
oh
no
mr
keith
the
housekeeper
voice
was
full
of
eager
protest
but
then
you
see
there
is
something
unusual
about
miss
beatrix
there
is
something
in
her
history
something
i
do
not
really
know
what
but
i
can
guess
and
dane
thinks
that
she
ought
to
be
kept
to
herself
somewhat
you
see
not
to
make
too
free
with
the
rest
of
the
family
bah
nonsense
you
are
talking
like
an
idiot
graves
i
i
beg
your
pardon
but
i
ca
help
it
a
woman
of
your
good
sound
common
sense
ought
to
know
better
than
to
repeat
such
rubbish
as
that
go
tell
miss
dane
that
i
am
here
in
the
and
ask
her
to
please
come
to
me
since
i
am
not
able
to
call
upon
her
i
wish
to
speak
with
her
as
soon
as
possible
do
that
a
good
soul
i
know
that
you
will
not
find
it
in
your
heart
to
refuse
my
request
graves
you
were
young
yourself
once
not
so
very
long
ago
graves
turned
away
shaking
her
gray
head
dubiously
very
well
the
consequences
be
upon
your
own
head
keith
she
said
solemnly
then
she
left
the
room
and
he
was
alone
with
his
own
thoughts
half
angry
half
amused
the
idea
he
exclaimed
his
anger
getting
the
upper
hand
to
attempt
to
keep
beatrix
and
me
apart
what
does
old
graves
mean
anyway
i
shall
ask
uncle
bernard
but
then
he
too
certainly
appears
to
be
off
his
base
as
well
as
the
housekeeper
what
a
curious
old
house
this
is
to
be
sure
but
come
what
may
i
mean
to
know
the
truth
i
mean
to
know
what
lynne
and
serena
meant
when
they
said
that
beatrix
left
them
to
be
married
ah
she
coming
my
own
my
sweet
i
hear
her
light
footsteps
heaven
bless
her
a
pause
at
the
door
then
a
faint
timid
rap
upon
it
come
in
cried
keith
eagerly
the
door
opened
slowly
and
beatrix
dane
stood
before
him
she
looked
very
fair
and
sweet
in
her
plain
black
gown
with
white
crape
at
throat
and
wrists
her
golden
hair
in
a
loose
coil
fastened
with
a
jet
arrow
you
sent
for
me
mr
kenyon
she
began
slowly
hesitatingly
i
did
i
wish
to
speak
with
you
on
a
matter
of
the
greatest
importance
come
here
beatrix
you
will
pardon
me
for
i
am
still
something
of
an
invalid
she
came
swiftly
to
his
side
and
extended
her
hand
oh
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
again
and
to
know
that
you
are
better
she
cried
gladly
beatrix
sit
down
here
by
me
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
lynne
and
her
daughter
both
declared
that
you
had
left
them
to
be
married
married
i
beatrix
opened
her
dark
eyes
why
it
is
simply
ridiculous
kenyon
you
are
the
only
single
gentleman
of
my
acquaintance
the
story
is
absurd
and
utterly
false
keith
breathed
freely
so
i
thought
beatrix
listen
to
me
i
want
you
for
my
wife
my
very
own
and
he
thinks
of
serena
lynne
and
a
desperate
impulse
prompts
him
to
add
the
sooner
the
better
keith
kenyon
is
not
a
dishonorable
man
but
he
does
not
love
the
woman
who
has
forced
him
into
a
distasteful
engagement
and
he
firmly
believes
that
when
once
she
learns
the
truth
she
will
free
him
from
the
irksome
bonds
clang
clang
goes
the
beatrix
starts
to
her
feet
who
in
the
world
can
that
be
cried
keith
impatiently
do
go
darling
do
not
leave
me
alone
it
is
no
one
coming
in
here
come
back
beatrix
and
tell
me
when
you
are
going
to
make
me
the
happiest
of
men
tramp
tramp
the
sound
of
footsteps
coming
down
the
hall
to
the
door
beatrix
makes
a
hasty
exit
from
the
room
by
means
of
another
door
just
as
the
voice
of
simons
loud
and
pompous
announces
a
lady
to
see
keith
she
would
come
in
here
mr
keith
the
last
in
a
low
tone
and
before
the
astonished
keith
can
collect
his
scattered
senses
before
he
has
time
to
recover
from
the
effects
of
this
crushing
blow
there
is
the
rustle
of
a
black
silk
skirt
and
a
tall
angular
ungraceful
figure
bounds
over
the
threshold
and
flings
herself
into
his
arms
he
catches
his
breath
with
a
cry
of
astonishment
not
unmingled
with
horror
it
is
serena
lynne
chapter
xiii
serena
game
for
a
moment
keith
kenyon
was
so
astonished
so
utterly
overwhelmed
with
amazement
that
he
could
not
find
words
to
utter
could
it
be
true
was
it
not
an
optical
delusion
surely
it
was
a
hideous
nightmare
an
ugly
dream
it
could
not
be
real
yet
the
tall
angular
figure
clad
in
stiff
black
silk
was
only
too
painfully
real
to
his
unwilling
eyes
and
the
voice
which
called
his
name
in
gushing
tones
was
really
and
truly
the
voice
of
serena
lynne
his
betrothed
wife
a
shiver
crept
over
him
he
half
rose
then
sank
back
into
the
and
then
at
last
he
found
voice
serena
good
heavens
it
is
really
you
what
has
happened
is
your
mother
dead
or
dead
no
thank
heaven
we
are
both
living
and
well
the
fact
is
keith
we
mamma
and
i
closed
up
the
house
the
very
day
after
you
left
us
and
decided
upon
a
little
trip
we
have
been
for
some
two
weeks
traveling
about
now
and
that
explains
our
unexpected
appearance
here
our
trip
being
partly
on
business
partly
for
pleasure
mamma
received
news
from
some
of
her
relatives
which
made
it
advisable
for
us
to
come
south
news
which
may
prove
of
pecuniary
benefit
to
us
so
we
placed
our
house
in
charge
of
rogers
and
started
at
once
she
told
her
falsehood
glibly
her
sallow
cheek
flushing
her
pale
eyes
scintillating
it
sounded
very
reasonable
and
how
could
keith
kenyon
know
that
it
was
false
or
detect
the
ring
of
untruth
in
her
story
one
of
the
most
unsuspicious
of
natures
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
this
woman
had
deliberately
followed
him
ignoring
the
letter
that
he
had
written
her
that
letter
in
which
he
had
begged
her
to
release
him
from
a
galling
bond
because
he
loved
another
woman
and
had
never
loved
serena
lynne
but
had
been
led
into
an
engagement
while
he
was
too
sick
and
feeble
to
realize
his
own
actions
it
was
a
bold
stroke
but
serena
lynne
was
capable
of
this
and
much
more
at
first
she
had
found
it
somewhat
difficult
to
induce
her
mother
to
with
her
in
the
scheme
which
she
had
concocted
but
one
part
of
her
story
to
keith
was
true
lynne
had
received
a
letter
from
her
sister
the
woman
who
had
once
been
keith
nurse
when
he
was
a
child
she
lived
in
an
obscure
town
in
louisiana
and
had
not
met
lynne
for
years
she
had
to
send
for
her
sister
and
lynne
could
not
well
refuse
to
aid
her
daughter
in
her
scheme
when
her
own
private
affairs
called
her
into
the
vicinity
of
keith
kenyon
home
and
serena
was
in
dead
earnest
she
had
sworn
to
marry
this
man
sworn
upon
bended
knee
that
she
would
never
give
him
up
this
man
whom
she
so
madly
insanely
loved
she
had
made
this
bold
move
risked
her
all
upon
one
cast
of
the
die
and
it
would
go
hard
with
her
before
she
would
willingly
resign
all
hope
and
give
up
the
man
who
was
bound
to
her
in
honor
though
his
chains
were
of
iron
and
galled
and
clanked
so
fearfully
his
eyes
sought
her
face
the
sallow
unlovely
features
looked
more
repulsive
to
him
than
ever
before
but
serena
his
voice
trembling
a
little
with
sudden
fear
did
you
not
receive
my
letter
your
letter
arching
her
pale
brows
with
assumed
surprise
why
how
could
i
when
we
left
home
the
very
day
after
you
did
and
so
you
did
write
to
me
keith
thank
you
i
shall
have
my
mail
forwarded
here
and
will
be
pleased
to
read
your
first
love
letter
to
me
even
though
it
is
a
little
behind
time
she
laughed
but
the
laugh
had
a
disagreeable
tone
and
was
a
failure
late
than
never
she
added
she
had
seated
herself
at
his
side
in
the
very
chair
that
beatrix
had
vacated
keith
felt
a
strange
feeling
of
aversion
creep
over
his
heart
at
sight
of
her
in
beatrix
place
it
was
the
sort
of
feeling
that
one
would
experience
to
see
a
net
closing
slowly
around
one
head
and
know
that
in
a
short
time
one
will
be
securely
imprisoned
with
no
way
of
making
an
escape
the
servant
informed
me
that
you
had
been
ill
ever
since
your
arrival
serena
observed
breaking
the
silence
between
them
i
am
so
glad
to
be
here
i
shall
remain
and
nurse
you
keith
face
grew
paler
than
before
of
course
you
are
only
jesting
he
returned
i
have
the
best
of
care
and
in
fact
am
all
right
now
except
that
i
need
rest
and
freedom
from
excitement
but
first
i
must
ease
my
mind
serena
listen
to
me
circumstances
have
rendered
it
absolutely
imperative
that
i
that
you
my
letter
contained
the
information
he
stopped
short
frozen
into
silence
by
the
curious
look
in
her
gleaming
eyes
she
knew
perfectly
well
what
information
that
letter
contained
but
she
would
have
bitten
her
tongue
off
before
she
would
help
him
in
the
matter
and
he
poor
fellow
was
so
confused
and
embarrassed
under
the
freezing
gaze
of
her
pale
blue
eyes
that
he
found
himself
unable
to
frame
an
intelligible
sentence
but
as
this
was
just
what
serena
wished
she
did
not
offer
a
helping
hand
but
allowed
him
to
flounder
among
a
sea
of
words
only
to
come
to
grief
he
must
not
make
an
explanation
he
must
not
refer
to
that
fatal
letter
and
acquaint
her
with
its
contents
her
role
was
ignorance
of
the
contents
of
the
letter
which
he
had
written
to
her
asking
her
to
release
him
from
the
undesired
marriage
engagement
and
if
he
found
opportunity
to
enlighten
her
in
regard
to
what
that
letter
contained
serena
knew
that
her
game
would
be
up
do
speak
of
anything
that
may
be
annoying
to
you
keith
she
suggested
i
insist
upon
your
having
perfect
rest
and
quiet
mamma
is
at
the
charles
hotel
she
added
swiftly
as
though
to
change
the
subject
i
suppose
you
will
send
for
her
to
come
here
serena
do
not
think
me
inhospitable
but
you
must
remember
that
oh
yes
your
uncle
the
old
gentleman
i
will
see
him
and
explain
my
intrusion
by
the
way
what
is
his
name
it
is
the
funniest
thing
keith
but
i
do
not
know
the
name
of
your
adopted
uncle
his
name
is
dane
bernard
dane
returned
keith
the
name
acted
like
magic
upon
serena
she
started
with
a
suppressed
exclamation
and
her
eyes
dilated
with
wild
surprise
which
was
almost
terror
why
that
was
the
name
the
very
same
name
of
the
old
man
who
had
sent
for
beatrix
and
was
she
not
beatrix
dane
a
slow
horror
an
unspoken
scarcely
tangible
suspicion
began
to
creep
through
her
heart
good
heavens
was
not
fate
leading
her
through
devious
ways
she
shut
her
thin
lips
closely
together
in
a
straight
narrow
line
and
her
pale
eyes
gleamed
with
an
unpleasant
light
i
fancy
that
i
am
just
in
time
she
muttered
fiercely
not
a
minute
too
soon
if
my
suspicions
are
correct
then
turning
to
keith
she
said
imploringly
you
will
surely
allow
me
to
stay
here
for
a
time
keith
if
dane
will
permit
me
you
will
not
object
he
shook
his
head
slowly
under
the
peculiar
circumstances
what
could
he
say
he
could
not
turn
her
away
and
the
great
old
house
was
amply
provided
with
accommodations
you
will
be
welcome
i
am
sure
he
returned
and
of
course
your
mother
will
join
you
here
at
once
i
think
you
need
not
ask
permission
to
remain
for
this
is
my
home
and
i
am
at
liberty
to
invite
my
friends
here
only
of
course
you
will
understand
serena
that
this
is
a
very
quiet
old
house
no
company
no
going
out
to
places
of
amusement
you
will
have
to
be
satisfied
with
an
exceedingly
quiet
life
i
shall
be
with
you
she
made
answer
as
though
that
argument
covered
all
defects
keith
sighed
i
will
send
the
carriage
for
your
mother
at
once
he
said
even
as
he
spoke
something
a
strange
foreboding
of
some
nameless
evil
something
which
he
could
neither
define
nor
understand
crept
over
his
heart
and
made
it
cold
and
heavy
as
a
stone
had
he
dreamed
the
truth
and
accepted
the
warning
and
shaped
his
future
conduct
accordingly
keith
kenyon
might
have
been
spared
much
suffering
and
my
story
would
be
minus
a
plot
but
he
could
not
read
the
future
or
understand
serena
lynne
motives
and
he
was
like
a
puppet
in
her
hands
and
an
honorable
upright
man
wholly
in
the
power
of
an
artful
designing
woman
has
a
very
poor
chance
of
escape
from
her
toils
keith
rang
the
bell
and
dispatched
simons
for
his
master
old
bernard
dane
soon
put
in
an
appearance
as
he
entered
the
leaning
on
his
cane
keith
rose
i
beg
your
pardon
uncle
bernard
he
began
for
sending
for
you
but
i
knew
you
would
not
mind
it
and
i
wish
to
present
a
lady
friend
a
lady
from
massachusetts
miss
serena
lynne
who
with
her
mother
will
be
our
guest
for
a
few
days
at
sound
of
those
last
words
serena
frowned
and
bit
her
lip
low
under
her
breath
she
muttered
firmly
a
few
days
indeed
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
stay
here
i
will
give
up
my
grand
wedding
festivities
and
i
will
be
keith
kenyon
wife
before
many
days
old
bernard
dane
received
serena
with
courtesy
politely
concealing
his
surprise
at
the
unexpected
addition
to
his
family
the
carriage
was
sent
at
once
for
lynne
and
serena
was
conducted
to
a
room
where
she
could
arrange
her
dress
what
a
grand
old
house
she
murmured
covetously
as
she
followed
graves
upstairs
to
a
luxurious
sleeping
apartment
how
i
shall
queen
it
here
it
will
not
be
long
now
as
the
thought
flitted
through
her
brain
there
was
the
sound
of
light
footsteps
coming
down
the
hall
serena
raised
her
eyes
and
paused
aghast
with
wordless
horror
coming
down
the
long
corridor
straight
toward
her
she
saw
beatrix
dane
chapter
xiv
complications
for
a
moment
serena
lynne
stood
glaring
down
upon
beatrix
with
eyes
full
of
blank
astonishment
which
beatrix
returned
with
interest
it
was
so
strange
so
sudden
so
unexpected
that
for
the
time
they
could
only
stand
and
stare
into
each
other
faces
at
last
serena
lynne
the
name
fell
from
beatrix
astonished
lips
like
a
groan
pale
eyes
flashed
with
the
light
of
a
wicked
triumph
you
she
hissed
vengefully
so
you
are
destined
to
cross
my
path
wherever
i
go
how
came
you
here
beatrix
eyes
met
her
wrathful
gaze
with
a
glance
of
cool
disdain
i
might
ask
you
the
same
question
she
retorted
i
am
here
miss
serena
lynne
because
this
is
my
home
now
old
bernard
dane
is
my
uncle
and
i
have
a
right
beneath
his
roof
may
i
ask
what
brought
you
here
serena
eyes
snapped
yes
you
may
ask
if
you
like
she
said
acidly
i
came
here
because
my
mother
and
i
were
taking
a
trip
through
the
south
and
i
had
a
right
to
see
my
betrothed
husband
your
betrothed
husband
faltered
beatrix
too
overcome
with
emotion
to
realize
what
she
was
saying
what
do
you
mean
serena
you
must
be
out
of
your
senses
not
at
all
returned
serena
curtly
i
should
think
you
would
understand
the
situation
by
this
time
without
any
further
explanation
from
me
i
am
engaged
to
be
married
to
keith
kenyon
surely
i
have
a
right
to
come
here
with
my
mother
when
he
is
ill
and
anxious
to
see
me
at
all
events
we
are
here
and
i
do
not
intend
to
leave
this
is
my
room
miss
beatrix
dane
as
beatrix
paused
upon
the
threshold
of
the
room
which
graves
had
assigned
to
serena
and
i
would
thank
you
to
leave
it
without
a
word
beatrix
turned
and
left
miss
lynne
alone
she
flew
like
a
wounded
creature
back
to
her
own
apartment
and
closed
and
locked
its
door
behind
her
for
a
time
she
stood
in
the
center
of
the
room
staring
vacantly
before
her
not
knowing
what
to
think
her
senses
were
in
such
a
whirl
what
did
this
mean
was
serena
telling
the
truth
if
so
then
keith
had
deceived
her
beatrix
in
the
most
heartless
manner
and
there
was
nothing
for
her
to
hope
for
upon
earth
she
fell
upon
her
knees
beside
the
bed
and
burying
her
face
in
the
pillows
wept
bitterly
she
realized
that
there
was
trouble
more
trouble
great
black
clouds
of
trouble
growing
dark
around
her
pathway
the
very
sight
of
serena
lynne
was
enough
to
warn
beatrix
of
fresh
cause
for
grief
she
arose
from
her
knees
at
last
and
bathed
her
face
and
arranged
her
hair
i
will
go
to
keith
at
once
she
said
and
ask
him
frankly
and
openly
why
serena
is
here
and
what
is
she
to
him
but
when
beatrix
entered
the
a
little
later
for
an
interview
with
keith
she
found
bernard
dane
there
and
of
course
private
conversation
was
impossible
the
old
man
glanced
up
with
a
scowl
as
beatrix
entered
the
room
who
sent
for
you
he
demanded
brusquely
the
color
arose
to
the
girl
pale
cheeks
no
one
sir
she
returned
with
spirit
i
was
not
aware
that
you
intend
to
cut
me
off
from
communication
with
the
rest
of
the
household
that
will
come
soon
enough
chuckled
the
old
man
half
audibly
but
beatrix
overheard
the
muttered
words
and
her
heart
sank
with
a
bitter
pang
what
did
he
mean
i
will
ask
him
when
i
see
him
alone
she
decided
he
shall
tell
me
what
this
strange
treatment
of
me
signifies
aloud
she
said
uncle
bernard
may
i
ask
you
what
brings
serena
lynne
to
this
house
she
is
my
bitter
enemy
my
persecutor
i
prefer
to
go
to
some
other
place
while
that
woman
is
here
old
bernard
dane
sunken
eyes
flashed
you
got
the
dane
grit
and
the
dane
temper
my
dear
he
snarled
but
i
advise
you
to
keep
it
well
in
hand
when
you
are
with
me
the
ladies
who
are
here
yes
as
he
marked
the
sudden
start
with
which
beatrix
heard
his
words
lynne
is
with
her
daughter
of
course
eminently
proper
to
be
sure
you
surely
did
not
think
that
miss
serena
lynne
would
come
clear
from
the
north
all
alone
to
visit
keith
i
do
know
i
am
sure
she
is
capable
of
a
great
deal
intervened
beatrix
then
she
added
softly
oh
forgive
me
uncle
bernard
i
do
not
mean
to
be
harsh
and
and
spiteful
but
the
sight
of
that
woman
just
stirs
up
every
uncomfortable
attribute
of
my
nature
uncle
bernard
did
you
ever
know
any
one
who
affected
you
in
that
way
the
very
sight
of
whom
would
stir
up
all
the
worst
dregs
of
your
nature
and
tempt
you
to
do
deeds
for
which
you
were
afterward
sorry
a
dull
crimson
dyed
the
old
man
wrinkled
cheeks
for
an
instant
did
i
humph
yes
my
salad
days
when
i
was
green
in
judgment
when
i
had
good
reason
to
shrink
from
the
sight
of
my
evil
genius
guy
kenyon
guy
kenyon
my
father
interrupted
keith
excitedly
now
uncle
bernard
you
must
tell
me
something
about
him
for
you
have
never
told
me
anything
and
i
know
so
little
of
him
you
will
never
learn
any
more
from
me
returned
the
old
man
harshly
arising
to
his
feet
and
now
i
must
go
and
interview
simons
that
rascally
nigger
is
getting
unmanageable
one
would
think
that
he
was
the
master
here
from
the
way
that
he
conducts
himself
lately
he
left
the
room
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
out
in
the
hall
he
came
to
a
pause
clinching
his
shaking
hands
upon
the
head
of
his
cane
his
face
pale
and
agitated
a
look
in
the
depths
of
his
sunken
dark
eyes
which
was
not
pleasant
to
see
guy
kenyon
he
muttered
harshly
his
bent
form
shaking
visibly
i
would
sooner
cut
off
my
right
hand
than
tell
guy
kenyon
son
what
he
once
was
to
me
i
had
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
as
learning
to
care
for
guy
kenyon
boy
but
somehow
my
heart
is
melting
i
must
be
in
my
dotage
for
i
find
my
hatred
growing
less
bitter
and
revenge
does
not
seem
one
half
so
sweet
and
desirable
as
it
once
did
the
time
was
when
revenge
was
the
only
object
for
which
i
existed
can
that
time
be
passing
now
am
i
growing
weak
and
foolish
as
i
grow
old
there
some
one
is
ringing
the
i
wonder
who
it
is
simons
made
haste
to
admit
the
visitor
while
bernard
dane
went
slowly
into
the
library
a
woman
closely
veiled
entered
and
was
shown
into
the
a
woman
dressed
in
black
and
who
spoke
in
a
low
hurried
tone
to
the
servant
she
inquired
for
lynne
tell
her
that
her
sister
ray
wishes
to
see
her
she
said
the
words
reached
old
bernard
dane
ears
and
a
frown
knit
his
brows
it
is
celia
he
muttered
his
face
growing
deathly
pale
and
he
grasped
the
arm
of
a
chair
which
stood
near
celia
ray
after
all
those
years
she
ventures
to
come
here
i
wish
i
could
unravel
the
mystery
which
lies
hidden
in
the
past
for
that
there
is
something
hidden
something
wrong
i
am
certain
he
left
the
library
and
made
his
way
straight
to
the
the
woman
was
standing
at
a
window
gazing
out
upon
the
green
lawn
starred
with
gorgeous
even
at
this
season
of
the
year
at
sound
of
the
closing
of
the
door
she
turned
swiftly
but
as
her
eyes
fell
upon
bernard
dane
face
she
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
bernard
she
cried
and
her
voice
trembled
perceptibly
i
did
not
expect
to
see
you
he
bowed
low
extending
his
hand
no
well
i
am
here
you
see
i
have
not
met
you
in
a
long
time
celia
and
i
thought
possibly
you
might
be
glad
to
see
me
once
more
glad
a
swift
light
flashed
into
her
pale
eyes
and
illumined
her
features
and
made
her
almost
pretty
a
younger
edition
of
her
sister
lynne
but
her
face
was
more
refined
and
she
had
a
winning
way
which
contrasted
strongly
with
lynne
awkward
abruptness
glad
she
repeated
once
more
softly
you
do
not
know
how
glad
bernard
and
in
those
few
words
one
could
read
a
whole
volume
of
affection
affection
for
this
unpleasant
old
man
that
was
truly
wonderful
celia
ray
was
the
only
woman
who
had
ever
loved
bernard
dane
and
her
love
for
him
had
been
the
bane
of
her
life
the
ruin
of
her
happiness
for
his
sake
she
had
lost
everything
on
earth
all
that
the
human
heart
prizes
all
ties
of
home
and
friends
and
all
for
naught
for
bernard
dane
had
not
returned
her
affection
he
had
never
loved
any
woman
in
all
his
long
hard
life
but
mildred
dane
who
had
not
loved
him
celia
ray
stood
gazing
into
the
old
man
face
with
an
eager
rapt
expression
to
her
he
was
young
and
handsome
you
do
not
look
well
she
exclaimed
i
can
see
that
you
have
been
and
you
would
not
let
me
know
it
oh
bernard
why
do
you
treat
me
with
such
hardness
why
have
you
doomed
me
to
a
lonely
life
and
yet
you
too
are
alone
she
sank
into
a
seat
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
while
under
her
breath
she
murmured
brokenly
dare
i
tell
him
all
at
this
late
day
would
he
not
kill
me
if
he
knew
what
i
have
done
but
at
that
moment
lynne
made
her
appearance
and
then
bernard
dane
withdrew
there
was
a
perplexed
expression
upon
his
face
and
as
he
went
slowly
back
to
the
library
he
muttered
to
himself
i
wonder
if
she
played
me
false
in
that
affair
poor
little
fool
she
did
not
dream
that
i
could
hear
her
whispered
words
just
now
what
idiots
people
are
who
indulge
in
soliloquy
i
never
was
guilty
of
it
in
my
life
forgetting
that
at
that
very
moment
he
was
soliloquizing
oh
woman
lovely
woman
with
a
satirical
smile
how
exceedingly
transparent
you
are
after
all
in
the
meantime
beatrix
was
left
alone
with
keith
but
once
alone
with
him
she
found
as
is
very
often
the
case
that
she
could
not
introduce
the
subject
upon
which
she
wished
to
speak
keith
broke
the
silence
himself
beatrix
in
a
wistful
tone
no
doubt
you
are
surprised
that
serena
has
come
here
you
are
no
more
surprised
and
annoyed
than
i
am
yes
her
face
full
of
wonder
i
thought
that
you
were
delighted
keith
colored
beatrix
darling
i
ask
you
to
trust
me
and
ask
no
questions
for
the
present
i
will
explain
all
as
soon
as
possible
will
you
try
to
trust
me
darling
his
eyes
were
upon
her
face
with
a
look
of
entreaty
what
could
she
say
but
yes
chapter
xv
betrothed
the
promise
was
readily
given
for
with
keith
dark
eyes
gazing
into
her
own
with
that
eager
earnest
gaze
beatrix
could
not
have
refused
even
if
she
had
so
desired
and
she
longed
to
trust
this
handsome
young
lover
who
had
won
her
girlish
heart
completely
what
one
earnestly
wishes
to
do
is
usually
accomplished
when
there
is
no
reason
why
the
obstacles
should
not
be
vanquished
and
beatrix
was
only
too
glad
to
place
confidence
in
keith
she
sank
into
the
seat
at
his
side
and
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
keith
her
voice
low
and
eager
you
would
not
deceive
me
would
you
remember
i
am
at
your
mercy
and
i
am
compelled
to
believe
in
you
i
must
trust
you
keith
i
could
not
live
without
you
now
i
could
not
his
eyes
lighted
up
with
a
rapturous
light
he
stooped
and
kissed
her
white
brow
beatrix
darling
he
was
beginning
but
just
then
the
door
opened
and
serena
sailed
into
the
room
well
i
must
say
miss
beatrix
dane
she
began
taking
possession
of
keith
with
an
air
of
proprietorship
you
are
a
bold
creature
i
intend
to
speak
to
dane
in
regard
to
your
shameless
conduct
here
all
alone
with
kenyon
go
up
to
your
own
room
and
stay
there
or
i
will
go
to
dane
at
once
and
he
will
see
that
you
keep
in
future
your
proper
place
in
this
house
beatrix
eyes
blazed
her
slight
form
trembled
she
stood
trembling
hesitating
but
keith
whispered
softly
go
dear
i
have
something
to
say
to
this
woman
i
will
explain
all
when
i
see
you
again
beatrix
you
will
trust
me
you
have
promised
to
do
so
i
will
she
left
the
room
with
hasty
steps
as
soon
as
the
door
had
closed
behind
her
keith
turned
to
serena
i
am
glad
that
you
have
come
back
to
this
room
he
began
slowly
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
serena
i
wrote
you
a
letter
which
i
am
very
sorry
to
find
you
did
not
receive
in
that
letter
i
told
you
oh
keith
keith
do
not
break
my
heart
with
unkindness
and
cruelty
now
she
cried
clasping
his
hand
in
both
her
bony
ones
i
suppose
in
your
letter
you
scolded
me
for
some
deficiency
i
ask
you
to
forgive
me
for
whatever
i
may
have
done
that
has
offended
or
in
any
way
annoyed
you
i
beg
your
pardon
i
beg
your
pardon
and
i
ask
you
to
have
pity
and
say
no
more
i
acknowledge
that
i
was
rude
to
that
girl
beatrix
dane
but
oh
keith
remember
that
i
have
had
a
hard
time
with
her
and
much
to
bear
on
her
account
she
left
our
humble
home
after
my
mother
had
cared
for
her
and
acted
a
mother
part
to
her
for
nearly
seventeen
long
years
she
left
us
with
the
intention
of
marrying
hush
that
is
false
false
serena
and
you
know
it
stormed
keith
angrily
losing
command
of
his
temper
at
last
this
poor
girl
has
been
wronged
i
wonder
you
dare
tell
me
such
tales
in
regard
to
her
serena
serena
shook
her
head
slowly
mournfully
truly
you
are
the
snare
of
the
fowler
she
quoted
sagely
that
wicked
girl
has
woven
her
net
about
you
and
are
forever
lost
nonsense
he
cried
angrily
serena
i
thought
you
possessed
more
common
sense
forgive
me
i
am
very
rude
but
you
are
driving
me
wild
with
your
insinuations
in
regard
to
beatrix
however
i
wish
to
speak
of
something
else
i
wish
to
say
serena
that
i
have
written
you
in
regard
to
our
engagement
the
foolish
engagement
existing
between
you
and
me
it
has
been
a
mistake
from
the
start
serena
a
great
and
unwise
mistake
we
must
rectify
it
now
how
oh
keith
keith
do
you
care
for
me
at
all
i
told
you
when
i
asked
you
to
be
my
wife
that
i
had
no
love
for
you
and
yet
you
were
willing
to
accept
me
without
love
pardon
me
serena
but
when
a
woman
accepts
an
offer
of
marriage
from
a
man
who
openly
acknowledges
that
he
does
not
love
her
she
must
be
prepared
to
accept
all
the
consequences
of
her
own
rash
and
act
all
the
shame
the
grief
and
humiliation
serena
i
have
never
loved
you
i
never
shall
and
i
love
another
woman
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
and
strength
it
is
my
desire
that
this
foolish
engagement
be
broken
off
at
once
at
once
you
will
thank
me
some
day
that
i
had
the
courage
to
put
an
end
to
it
before
it
was
too
late
silence
awful
silence
settled
down
upon
the
room
you
could
hear
distinctly
the
beating
of
serena
lynne
heart
as
she
sat
staring
straight
before
her
into
space
with
a
numbed
awful
look
upon
her
face
which
might
have
touched
a
heart
of
stone
keith
felt
his
own
heart
grow
sore
with
sorrow
for
her
suffering
but
he
felt
that
he
was
doing
right
like
the
surgeon
who
pities
and
sympathizes
inwardly
with
the
sufferer
before
him
yet
must
not
hesitate
to
plunge
the
sharp
keen
knife
into
the
wound
or
the
sufferer
will
die
he
felt
that
he
must
end
all
this
unpleasant
complication
with
serena
before
another
day
had
passed
or
he
could
not
tell
into
what
trouble
his
own
mad
act
might
lead
him
i
have
done
wrong
he
muttered
to
himself
in
asking
her
to
marry
me
i
must
have
been
mad
mad
but
it
is
not
too
late
to
rectify
the
mistake
and
i
must
end
this
affair
at
once
and
forever
but
still
serena
sat
like
a
statue
and
did
not
speak
or
move
keith
began
to
feel
uneasy
serena
he
said
gently
i
do
not
wish
to
wound
you
but
there
must
be
a
final
understanding
between
us
now
there
shall
be
she
cried
angrily
starting
up
i
consider
the
engagement
at
an
end
i
release
you
now
go
and
marry
beatrix
dane
but
my
opinion
is
that
you
will
rue
the
day
that
you
were
guilty
of
such
mad
folly
keith
kenyon
may
you
be
as
happy
as
you
deserve
but
as
she
left
the
room
her
face
working
convulsively
her
breath
coming
in
broken
gasps
she
was
whispering
softly
to
herself
he
shall
never
marry
her
never
i
swear
that
come
what
may
keith
kenyon
shall
be
mine
it
is
the
one
object
of
my
life
i
shall
not
give
it
up
without
a
struggle
but
slowly
and
surely
the
hour
was
coming
when
serena
lynne
would
be
forced
to
say
that
all
hope
was
vain
that
very
day
keith
made
up
his
mind
to
take
a
decisive
step
he
would
make
beatrix
his
wife
at
once
privately
and
then
no
matter
what
might
happen
she
would
have
him
to
defend
and
protect
her
and
nothing
should
ever
part
them
nothing
could
ever
come
between
them
save
death
the
more
he
thought
of
it
the
more
determined
did
he
grow
at
last
he
rose
and
made
his
way
slowly
out
into
the
grounds
lying
fair
and
green
in
the
wintry
sunshine
as
though
it
were
spring
still
weak
keith
felt
the
balmy
air
revive
him
and
strengthen
him
and
found
that
after
a
little
he
was
able
to
walk
quite
well
down
in
a
pretty
honeysuckle
bower
he
found
beatrix
sitting
on
a
rustic
seat
pale
and
silent
she
looked
as
if
she
had
been
crying
beatrix
the
sound
of
his
voice
made
an
electric
thrill
run
over
her
she
started
to
her
feet
is
it
really
you
out
at
last
she
cried
oh
keith
i
am
so
glad
he
took
her
hands
in
his
and
drew
her
head
down
so
that
he
could
look
into
her
eyes
sweetheart
he
whispered
tenderly
i
want
you
to
be
my
wife
at
once
without
any
delay
listen
there
is
nothing
between
serena
lynne
and
me
absolutely
nothing
believe
me
darling
now
this
is
my
plan
i
will
send
today
and
procure
the
license
tomorrow
we
will
drive
in
the
carriage
to
a
clergyman
house
the
drive
will
do
me
good
and
you
shall
come
back
my
little
wife
then
no
one
can
part
us
never
while
we
live
will
you
consent
beatrix
the
beautiful
dark
eyes
wavered
from
before
his
eager
passionate
gaze
she
trembled
like
a
leaf
say
yes
beatrix
there
is
no
one
to
object
we
have
no
one
to
consult
remember
uncle
bernard
wished
us
to
marry
say
yes
dear
and
make
me
perfectly
happy
no
one
ever
loved
a
woman
as
i
love
you
my
beautiful
darling
and
so
the
answer
was
given
that
one
little
word
of
three
letters
which
was
large
enough
to
cover
a
whole
of
future
woe
the
secret
marriage
was
arranged
to
take
place
on
the
following
day
keith
felt
a
strange
dislike
to
revealing
the
truth
to
old
bernard
dane
after
what
the
old
man
had
said
concerning
a
marriage
with
beatrix
the
very
marriage
which
he
had
himself
first
planned
keith
felt
certain
that
bernard
dane
would
now
bitterly
oppose
the
marriage
and
keith
determined
that
he
would
not
give
the
old
man
a
chance
to
do
so
so
the
fatal
plot
was
formed
the
secret
marriage
arranged
and
they
parted
that
night
with
the
understanding
that
on
the
morrow
beatrix
would
become
keith
kenyon
wife
at
that
very
moment
up
in
her
own
room
serena
lynne
was
hurriedly
turning
over
the
contents
of
her
trunk
her
face
pale
as
death
her
eyes
full
of
hatred
all
at
once
she
snatched
up
from
the
depths
of
the
trunk
a
small
tin
box
ah
miss
beatrix
dane
she
hissed
revengefully
if
i
am
not
mistaken
i
have
you
in
my
power
at
last
chapter
xvi
a
midnight
interview
alone
in
her
room
that
night
beatrix
sat
down
at
the
open
window
to
think
over
the
new
life
so
soon
to
be
unfolded
to
her
keith
wife
no
position
in
the
world
could
be
so
desirable
no
girl
was
ever
so
happy
as
she
he
is
so
noble
so
good
so
grand
she
thought
to
herself
her
fair
cheek
flushing
with
rapture
at
thought
of
her
lover
perfections
how
noble
he
appeared
in
her
eyes
how
handsome
how
manly
to
her
there
was
but
one
man
worth
looking
at
in
the
world
handsome
keith
kenyon
the
moments
glided
by
still
the
girl
sat
there
wrapped
up
in
her
own
thoughts
only
think
tomorrow
at
this
time
she
would
be
his
wife
his
wife
surely
there
could
be
nothing
more
to
be
desired
on
earth
how
hard
i
will
try
to
please
him
and
to
make
him
happy
she
whispered
softly
to
herself
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
calm
starlit
sky
above
her
head
her
heart
beating
fast
with
rapture
oh
keith
she
murmured
half
aloud
i
pray
the
good
god
to
make
me
worthy
of
your
great
love
i
will
be
a
true
and
faithful
wife
and
all
the
rest
of
my
life
shall
be
dedicated
to
making
you
happy
my
keith
my
king
as
the
words
passed
her
lips
some
subtle
instinct
warned
her
that
she
was
no
longer
alone
she
turned
her
head
and
her
face
grew
pale
as
death
as
her
eyes
fell
upon
the
form
of
serena
serena
lynne
watching
her
with
intense
hatred
in
the
depths
of
her
evil
eyes
with
a
stifled
cry
beatrix
started
to
her
feet
serena
glided
swiftly
softly
to
her
side
what
are
you
doing
in
my
room
at
this
hour
demanded
beatrix
sternly
how
dare
you
intrude
upon
my
privacy
without
an
invitation
what
evil
errand
brings
you
here
serena
eyes
snapped
she
set
her
teeth
down
hard
upon
her
thin
under
lip
and
clenched
her
hands
as
though
she
would
like
to
clasp
them
around
the
girl
white
throat
upon
what
errand
do
i
intrude
here
at
this
late
hour
she
repeated
hissing
the
words
sibilantly
forth
from
between
her
clenched
teeth
i
will
very
soon
enlighten
you
miss
beatrix
dane
i
have
come
here
to
ask
you
a
question
is
it
your
intention
to
marry
keith
kenyon
ah
yes
i
know
i
suspect
a
great
deal
i
have
released
him
from
the
engagement
between
us
but
i
have
only
done
so
for
a
purpose
i
wished
to
bring
him
to
his
senses
in
regard
to
you
and
i
think
that
i
shall
be
able
to
do
so
i
have
laid
a
plan
and
the
first
step
was
to
sever
all
ties
between
keith
kenyon
and
myself
and
then
then
i
come
to
you
as
an
auxiliary
in
the
next
move
in
the
game
a
game
played
for
the
welfare
of
keith
kenyon
his
future
happiness
beatrix
dane
i
demand
of
you
is
it
your
intention
to
marry
this
man
this
man
who
belongs
to
me
in
the
sight
of
god
answer
me
i
demand
it
i
will
have
the
truth
but
beatrix
did
not
reply
she
sat
gazing
out
into
the
misty
night
her
eyes
full
of
bitter
sorrow
she
was
conscious
of
nothing
she
heard
nothing
saw
nothing
only
over
and
over
in
her
ears
those
words
hard
and
cruel
repeated
themselves
this
man
who
belongs
to
me
in
the
sight
of
god
will
you
answer
me
serena
voice
cut
across
the
silence
like
a
knife
beatrix
started
and
a
shudder
ran
over
her
slender
frame
yes
i
will
answer
you
she
returned
bravely
i
am
going
to
do
as
i
think
best
in
this
matter
serena
and
i
certainly
shall
not
consult
your
wishes
keith
kenyon
is
nothing
to
you
nothing
less
than
nothing
serena
face
was
pale
to
ghastliness
her
form
shook
perceptibly
her
eyes
scintillated
she
was
a
very
unlovely
picture
of
anger
impotent
restrained
rage
as
she
stood
there
be
careful
she
hissed
be
careful
beatrix
dane
i
give
you
fair
warning
you
are
treading
upon
dangerous
ground
you
are
making
a
grave
mistake
it
would
be
better
for
you
if
you
had
died
when
you
were
born
rather
than
to
cross
my
wishes
now
answer
me
one
question
you
think
that
you
love
keith
kenyon
would
your
love
change
or
alter
if
you
were
to
learn
that
he
is
no
longer
wealthy
that
old
bernard
dane
has
altered
his
will
and
intends
leaving
his
fortune
elsewhere
how
would
you
like
to
be
keith
kenyon
and
live
in
a
cot
and
do
your
own
housework
and
be
compelled
to
see
him
toil
like
a
slave
from
day
to
day
because
he
had
taken
upon
him
the
burden
of
a
wife
answer
me
that
beatrix
dane
is
your
love
unselfish
enough
to
give
him
up
rather
than
see
him
reduced
to
that
my
love
is
great
enough
and
unselfish
enough
to
make
any
sacrifice
for
his
welfare
returned
beatrix
her
sweet
voice
trembling
audibly
but
it
would
not
make
him
happy
to
give
me
up
i
am
willing
to
share
poverty
with
him
does
not
the
marriage
service
bind
us
better
for
worse
for
richer
for
poorer
oh
serena
you
must
have
a
strange
opinion
of
my
love
if
you
think
that
i
would
turn
away
from
him
because
he
had
lost
his
inheritance
his
inheritance
cried
serena
scornfully
and
pray
what
is
yours
do
you
suspect
ah
my
young
friend
if
you
knew
if
you
held
in
your
possession
the
fatal
truth
which
i
have
good
reason
to
believe
is
connected
with
your
life
you
would
commit
suicide
rather
than
marry
keith
kenyon
serena
i
have
heard
enough
of
this
retorted
beatrix
her
temper
getting
beyond
her
control
be
good
enough
to
retire
for
it
is
very
late
and
i
am
tired
and
sleepy
ah
yes
to
be
sure
sneered
serena
you
long
to
be
asleep
that
you
may
dream
of
your
handsome
lover
but
wait
a
moment
beatrix
dane
this
is
the
last
time
that
i
shall
trouble
you
will
you
heed
me
when
i
say
that
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
you
are
destined
to
wreck
and
ruin
keith
kenyon
life
there
is
something
that
you
have
yet
to
learn
concerning
yourself
and
when
you
do
learn
it
you
will
curse
the
hour
that
you
promised
to
become
his
wife
something
which
will
ruin
and
curse
his
whole
existence
as
well
as
your
own
and
make
life
a
scene
of
horror
to
you
both
will
you
believe
me
when
i
say
but
beatrix
could
bear
no
more
she
moved
swiftly
to
serena
side
and
laying
her
hand
upon
her
arm
led
her
to
the
door
and
opened
it
now
go
she
commanded
and
serena
was
so
overwhelmed
with
astonishment
that
she
silently
obeyed
beatrix
closed
the
door
sharply
and
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
and
left
alone
at
last
she
prepared
to
retire
she
was
soon
asleep
and
her
last
thoughts
were
of
keith
kenyon
and
how
dear
he
was
to
her
she
thought
too
of
serena
strange
words
and
hidden
threats
but
she
could
see
too
plainly
that
serena
was
half
insane
with
jealous
hatred
and
beatrix
shut
her
heart
upon
her
vile
insinuations
and
so
at
length
she
sank
away
in
peaceful
slumber
unconscious
of
the
dark
clouds
slowly
but
surely
gathering
about
her
and
soon
to
break
in
awful
ruin
upon
her
defenseless
head
a
strange
future
a
strange
fate
lay
spread
out
before
her
a
thorny
path
for
her
little
feet
to
tread
had
she
known
the
bitter
truth
beatrix
would
not
have
wished
to
awaken
again
in
this
world
but
she
did
not
know
and
it
was
well
that
she
did
not
for
the
knowledge
of
her
awful
fate
her
dark
inheritance
would
have
driven
her
mad
and
yet
some
day
she
must
know
she
must
know
poor
child
let
her
dream
on
now
in
innocent
unconsciousness
of
what
the
future
has
in
store
for
her
soon
enough
the
day
will
come
when
beatrix
dane
will
pray
for
the
boon
of
death
the
peace
and
quiet
of
the
grave
in
the
meantime
alone
in
her
own
room
serena
sat
before
a
table
upon
which
she
had
placed
the
tin
box
she
looked
like
a
fiend
gloating
over
the
possession
of
another
human
soul
as
her
long
fingers
touched
carefully
the
scorched
and
blackened
fragments
of
that
fatal
letter
which
doctor
lynne
last
act
on
earth
was
to
destroy
hoping
to
hide
forever
the
secret
which
it
contained
i
will
do
it
muttered
serena
hoarsely
her
eyes
sparkling
with
hatred
and
malice
i
will
take
these
papers
tomorrow
to
an
expert
i
know
just
where
to
find
one
and
i
think
they
can
be
deciphered
and
then
arising
to
her
feet
and
clinching
her
cold
hands
fiercely
together
miss
beatrix
dane
i
shall
hold
you
in
the
hollow
of
my
hand
chapter
xvii
serena
succeeds
that
night
beatrix
dreamed
a
strange
dream
she
thought
that
she
was
alone
in
the
mysterious
round
room
in
the
western
tower
gazing
upon
a
portrait
which
hung
upon
the
wall
the
portrait
of
a
woman
a
beautiful
woman
the
sweet
lips
parted
with
a
smile
surely
the
saddest
smile
that
ever
touched
human
lips
and
as
beatrix
gazed
upon
the
portrait
the
painted
lips
seemed
to
open
and
breathe
softly
the
one
word
beware
under
the
spell
of
a
weird
fascination
beatrix
stood
before
the
portrait
in
her
dream
her
heart
beating
fast
with
a
strange
terror
her
limbs
trembling
a
cold
chill
creeping
slowly
over
her
she
seemed
on
the
verge
of
suffocation
her
breath
came
in
fitful
gasps
she
awoke
good
heavens
where
was
she
she
found
herself
alone
in
the
round
room
in
the
western
tower
in
her
long
white
with
a
lighted
lamp
in
one
hand
gazing
about
her
with
wild
dilated
eyes
how
had
she
reached
that
room
traversed
the
long
corridors
ascended
the
spiral
staircase
in
her
sleep
with
a
shivering
terror
creeping
slowly
over
her
the
girl
was
about
to
turn
away
and
retrace
her
steps
to
her
own
room
but
at
that
moment
her
eyes
fell
upon
a
small
knob
like
an
electric
button
in
one
of
the
panels
of
the
wall
she
had
never
seen
it
before
notwithstanding
her
frequent
visits
to
the
room
it
was
at
the
very
spot
where
in
her
dream
she
had
seen
the
portrait
impelled
by
a
strange
impulse
beatrix
pressed
her
finger
lightly
upon
the
knob
it
moved
and
the
wooden
panel
slowly
revolved
turned
outward
and
revealed
the
portrait
of
a
woman
face
the
very
face
of
her
dream
she
stood
before
it
pale
and
trembling
full
of
a
strange
terror
for
which
she
could
not
find
a
name
would
the
painted
lips
open
and
speak
even
as
in
her
dream
who
was
the
woman
before
her
she
drew
nearer
and
peered
curiously
into
the
painted
face
there
was
a
look
of
piteous
sadness
in
the
large
dark
eyes
as
though
an
awful
doom
was
resting
upon
her
as
she
gazed
her
sharp
eyes
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
name
affixed
to
the
portrait
she
bent
her
head
to
read
it
and
her
heart
gave
a
great
bound
and
then
stood
still
for
the
name
was
mildred
dane
so
this
was
her
mother
her
own
dear
mother
whom
she
had
never
seen
whom
she
could
not
remember
why
was
the
picture
hidden
away
in
this
room
this
mysterious
room
in
the
deserted
and
unfrequented
tower
what
strange
mystery
enshrouded
the
fate
of
mildred
dane
how
had
she
suffered
for
that
some
tragedy
was
connected
with
her
life
beatrix
had
long
been
convinced
and
it
needed
only
a
look
into
that
beautiful
hopeless
face
to
confirm
her
suspicions
why
was
the
portrait
hidden
here
and
what
was
the
secret
of
mildred
dane
life
in
vain
did
mildred
dane
daughter
turn
the
question
over
in
her
mind
there
was
no
answer
but
as
she
stood
staring
blankly
into
the
pictured
face
before
her
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
folded
paper
lying
in
the
embrasure
where
the
picture
stood
when
it
swung
around
and
disclosed
itself
there
was
a
narrow
space
left
behind
and
there
the
paper
lay
beatrix
snatched
it
up
i
will
see
what
it
is
she
exclaimed
this
is
my
mother
portrait
and
i
have
a
right
tomorrow
i
will
demand
of
bernard
dane
why
her
portrait
is
hidden
here
its
face
to
the
wall
alone
in
this
dreary
room
which
was
used
in
times
past
for
god
only
knows
what
dreadful
purposes
i
must
know
the
meaning
of
this
mystery
grasping
the
folded
paper
in
one
cold
hand
beatrix
made
her
way
back
to
her
own
chamber
locked
herself
in
and
sat
down
to
examine
the
paper
so
strangely
come
into
her
possession
it
was
a
letter
addressed
to
bernard
dane
in
a
delicate
hand
the
ink
faded
but
still
legible
you
have
loved
me
bernard
dane
so
ran
the
written
lines
and
i
am
grateful
for
your
love
though
i
can
not
return
it
but
since
you
have
told
me
all
all
the
bad
black
secret
of
my
doomed
life
which
has
been
concealed
from
me
until
now
i
feel
that
with
love
or
ties
of
friendship
i
have
nothing
to
do
for
me
there
can
be
no
earthly
affection
no
future
no
tender
care
the
ties
of
home
the
love
of
little
innocent
children
are
not
for
me
oh
bernard
surely
in
this
bitter
knowledge
that
has
come
upon
me
at
last
you
are
amply
avenged
for
i
am
accursed
accursed
the
heritage
into
which
i
have
come
descended
to
me
straight
from
my
south
american
ancestors
has
wrought
the
ruin
of
my
whole
life
yet
i
never
knew
it
never
suspected
it
until
it
was
too
late
and
they
had
forced
me
to
marry
old
godfrey
dane
upon
my
little
child
my
little
innocent
beatrix
the
curse
will
descend
the
awful
curse
which
has
desolated
my
life
her
dark
inheritance
will
come
upon
her
and
she
will
long
for
death
and
curse
the
mother
who
gave
her
birth
oh
bernard
bernard
pity
me
and
help
me
to
escape
kill
me
bernard
will
you
not
it
will
be
such
a
grand
relief
to
be
free
from
this
horrible
burden
to
be
done
with
this
curse
and
get
out
of
the
world
anywhere
anywhere
here
the
writing
ceased
abruptly
and
the
letter
ended
with
its
grewsome
secret
still
untold
beatrix
crumpled
the
letter
in
her
shaking
hand
and
rising
to
her
feet
began
to
pace
to
and
fro
her
face
as
white
as
the
face
of
the
dead
her
eyes
wild
with
horror
the
madness
of
despair
in
the
name
of
god
she
groaned
desperately
what
is
this
secret
this
maddening
tantalizing
secret
the
curse
which
has
ruined
my
mother
life
and
which
i
firmly
believe
brought
her
to
her
death
oh
god
have
pity
and
deliver
me
from
this
awful
curse
but
if
i
must
suffer
if
i
can
not
get
free
let
me
know
in
pity
and
mercy
let
me
know
the
nature
of
the
awful
blight
which
hangs
over
my
life
like
a
curse
alas
poor
beatrix
poor
unhappy
child
she
is
destined
to
learn
soon
enough
and
when
that
hour
of
darkness
comes
prone
upon
her
face
in
the
dust
she
will
cry
aloud
in
bitter
anguish
oh
god
my
god
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me
but
at
last
worn
out
with
her
bitter
thoughts
and
faint
and
exhausted
the
girl
crept
into
bed
once
more
and
her
last
thoughts
as
her
head
rested
upon
the
pillow
were
of
keith
kenyon
and
the
morrow
which
was
to
be
her
and
although
she
dreamed
it
not
a
day
of
doom
morning
dawned
fair
and
clear
with
the
sunshine
glinting
over
the
smooth
lawn
where
even
in
this
wintry
season
the
grass
was
green
and
with
birds
chirping
in
the
branches
of
the
trees
quite
a
holiday
time
beatrix
arose
early
and
the
first
object
upon
which
her
eyes
fell
was
the
letter
which
she
had
so
strangely
discovered
the
night
before
at
least
that
was
no
dream
she
dressed
herself
and
made
her
way
at
once
to
the
round
room
in
the
western
tower
she
wished
to
restore
the
portrait
to
its
former
position
but
when
she
entered
the
round
room
there
was
no
trace
of
a
portrait
to
be
seen
even
the
brass
knob
had
disappeared
dazed
and
bewildered
the
girl
left
the
room
and
went
and
out
into
the
grounds
she
felt
restless
and
uneasy
her
heart
was
weighed
down
with
a
strange
foreboding
yet
today
was
to
be
her
directly
after
breakfast
serena
announced
her
intention
of
going
out
she
and
lynne
were
to
take
their
departure
in
a
day
or
two
and
serena
declared
that
she
had
important
business
to
attend
to
which
might
occupy
her
all
day
there
was
an
unnatural
glitter
in
her
pale
eyes
as
they
rested
upon
beatrix
face
and
beatrix
fancied
that
there
was
something
like
concealed
triumph
in
the
tones
of
her
shrill
voice
the
girl
heart
sank
like
lead
in
spite
of
her
efforts
to
be
brave
for
well
she
knew
that
that
look
upon
serena
lynne
face
boded
evil
to
somebody
no
matter
she
whispered
softly
under
her
breath
after
today
they
can
not
harm
me
i
shall
be
keith
wife
keith
own
beloved
wife
he
will
protect
me
from
all
serena
donned
a
street
dress
and
set
forth
her
veil
drawn
closely
over
her
face
as
though
to
conceal
her
features
one
gloved
hand
holding
tightly
as
though
it
was
precious
a
small
tin
box
her
pale
eyes
glittered
with
exultation
behind
the
folds
of
her
tissue
veil
she
seemed
eager
and
anxious
so
she
was
just
as
eager
and
impatient
to
begin
her
dreadful
work
as
the
vulture
which
waits
greedily
for
the
corpse
to
putrefy
upon
which
it
expects
to
make
its
horrid
feast
she
made
her
way
to
the
very
outskirts
of
the
business
quarter
of
the
city
pausing
before
a
long
row
of
offices
in
a
building
she
drew
a
card
from
her
pocket
and
glanced
at
an
address
upon
it
her
face
lighted
up
with
satisfaction
i
believe
i
am
right
she
said
half
aloud
this
is
the
place
she
entered
a
doorway
and
ascended
a
flight
of
bare
stairs
a
little
later
she
was
standing
in
an
office
in
the
presence
of
a
pale
elderly
man
who
was
seated
at
a
long
table
covered
with
papers
serena
advanced
and
laid
the
box
upon
the
table
you
are
demorest
are
you
not
she
began
abruptly
the
man
bowed
and
rose
to
offer
her
a
seat
she
checked
him
with
a
slight
gesture
no
thanks
i
will
not
detain
you
i
have
here
the
fragments
of
a
letter
supposed
to
be
important
and
which
has
been
exposed
to
fire
i
ask
if
you
can
decipher
its
contents
please
examine
and
let
me
know
ten
minutes
later
he
lifted
his
head
from
the
small
heap
of
paper
before
him
yes
madame
he
returned
gravely
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
it
can
be
deciphered
i
promise
you
in
a
few
hours
time
to
restore
to
you
the
contents
of
the
letter
very
well
her
eyes
were
blazing
i
will
leave
them
now
and
call
later
in
the
day
restore
the
contents
of
that
letter
so
that
it
can
be
easily
read
and
i
will
pay
you
handsomely
and
drawing
her
veil
closely
over
her
face
she
left
the
office
her
evil
work
well
done
chapter
xviii
how
the
secret
is
told
when
serena
had
left
the
house
beatrix
went
straight
to
old
bernard
dane
room
and
rapped
at
the
door
come
in
cried
a
harsh
voice
and
beatrix
pushed
the
door
open
and
entered
the
room
bernard
dane
was
standing
before
a
window
gazing
out
into
the
grounds
his
wrinkled
face
looking
grave
and
thoughtful
at
sound
of
the
girl
footsteps
he
turned
slowly
and
as
his
eyes
fell
upon
her
pale
troubled
face
something
like
pity
flashed
into
his
own
but
only
for
a
moment
well
he
demanded
sharply
as
she
paused
before
him
uncle
bernard
beatrix
voice
was
low
and
hurried
she
shrank
from
the
interview
yet
she
felt
that
she
must
go
through
with
it
i
have
intruded
upon
you
to
ask
you
a
question
i
am
here
to
demand
of
you
the
secret
of
my
mother
life
and
death
why
is
her
portrait
hidden
away
in
the
round
room
with
its
face
turned
to
the
wall
what
is
this
secret
which
her
and
which
her
own
handwriting
declares
is
destined
to
descend
like
a
curse
upon
the
head
of
her
child
uncle
bernard
i
must
have
an
answer
this
silence
is
unjust
it
is
cruel
it
is
maddening
tell
me
what
is
this
secret
connected
with
my
mother
i
know
the
old
man
face
was
a
study
as
he
stood
listening
to
her
eager
outburst
his
keen
dark
eyes
fixed
upon
her
face
with
a
penetrating
look
in
their
depths
he
shook
his
gray
head
my
dear
i
will
not
now
that
is
all
and
it
is
quite
useless
to
ask
me
any
more
questions
and
there
is
no
one
else
in
the
world
who
can
enlighten
you
so
it
will
be
useless
to
seek
information
elsewhere
beatrix
my
child
why
torture
yourself
in
this
way
be
content
as
you
are
and
do
not
seek
to
look
back
upon
the
past
or
trouble
yourself
in
regard
to
the
future
see
here
child
the
old
man
voice
softened
insensibly
you
must
believe
that
i
am
acting
for
your
good
when
you
first
came
here
i
resolved
upon
a
step
the
very
thought
of
which
now
fills
my
heart
with
horror
i
had
wished
to
see
you
and
keith
married
but
now
oh
my
god
i
would
sooner
see
you
both
in
your
graves
it
is
true
too
true
beatrix
i
am
going
to
send
you
away
from
this
place
if
you
remain
here
you
and
keith
will
marry
even
against
my
wishes
i
feel
it
and
it
would
be
better
much
better
for
you
to
be
dead
and
buried
than
to
take
such
a
step
do
you
hear
me
beatrix
yes
sir
the
sweet
voice
trembling
but
in
the
great
dark
eyes
a
look
of
determination
ah
bernard
dane
your
warning
comes
too
late
you
have
sowed
and
you
must
reap
if
a
man
sows
tares
he
can
not
harvest
wheat
she
turned
and
left
him
alone
without
another
word
give
up
keith
kenyon
not
if
she
knew
it
on
the
contrary
the
girl
felt
more
determined
than
ever
to
become
keith
wife
he
is
the
only
creature
in
the
wide
world
who
loves
me
and
i
love
him
with
all
my
heart
my
darling
i
be
his
wife
and
we
can
not
help
being
happy
even
though
uncle
bernard
should
disinherit
him
she
went
to
her
own
room
and
sat
down
to
think
over
the
situation
she
did
not
wish
to
disobey
her
uncle
but
bernard
dane
had
no
right
to
dispose
of
her
as
though
she
were
a
toy
a
puppet
in
his
hands
she
would
not
endure
it
good
heavens
how
unjust
she
exclaimed
indignantly
he
did
all
in
his
power
to
make
us
care
for
each
other
and
now
when
it
is
too
late
he
wants
to
separate
us
he
must
be
mad
as
she
sat
there
absorbed
in
reverie
a
message
came
from
keith
asking
her
to
come
out
into
the
grounds
she
made
haste
to
obey
the
summons
and
once
out
in
the
grounds
together
they
discussed
the
coming
event
it
is
all
arranged
my
darling
he
said
as
he
kissed
the
sweet
red
lips
and
in
a
few
short
hours
you
will
belong
to
me
never
to
part
on
earth
never
any
more
she
had
meant
to
tell
him
of
her
interview
with
bernard
dane
and
the
old
man
stern
command
that
they
should
forget
each
other
but
it
seemed
a
pity
to
trouble
him
or
cast
a
cloud
upon
his
happiness
and
after
all
keith
was
his
own
master
so
she
held
her
peace
and
said
nothing
of
her
interview
with
her
uncle
and
thus
she
made
a
fatal
mistake
had
she
confided
all
to
her
lover
he
would
have
demanded
an
explanation
from
bernard
dane
and
much
unhappiness
and
suffering
might
have
been
prevented
but
what
lover
ever
listened
to
reason
a
vague
uneasiness
had
stolen
into
keith
heart
but
he
accounted
for
it
by
the
peculiar
circumstances
in
which
they
were
placed
and
resolved
to
say
nothing
that
would
trouble
her
he
was
happy
very
happy
in
the
prospect
of
making
beatrix
his
wife
so
soon
darling
he
said
softly
pressing
the
light
form
to
his
heart
everything
is
arranged
we
will
drive
out
at
three
in
the
we
will
go
direct
to
darrell
house
the
clergyman
who
is
a
friend
of
mine
the
license
is
already
procured
nothing
to
wait
for
not
even
the
ring
drawing
a
tiny
velvet
case
from
his
pocket
he
displayed
a
heavy
gold
band
and
with
it
a
glittering
diamond
here
sweetheart
let
me
put
on
the
badge
of
your
slavery
holding
up
the
diamond
as
he
spoke
then
with
a
swift
glance
into
the
lovely
downcast
face
he
slipped
the
ring
upon
the
third
finger
of
her
left
hand
but
beatrix
did
not
need
a
ring
to
remind
her
of
her
love
for
keith
we
broke
no
gold
or
sign
of
stronger
faith
to
be
but
i
wear
his
last
look
in
my
heart
which
said
love
but
thee
three
found
the
two
lovers
seated
in
the
carriage
on
their
way
to
the
clergyman
house
a
little
later
beatrix
dane
came
forth
beatrix
dane
no
longer
but
kenyon
how
different
everything
seemed
the
whole
world
was
metamorphosed
to
her
eyes
she
glanced
into
keith
face
with
a
look
of
wordless
love
oh
keith
she
whispered
softly
i
am
so
happy
it
was
the
last
time
that
such
words
were
destined
to
pass
her
lips
for
many
a
dark
and
dreadful
day
they
reached
home
and
beatrix
went
straight
to
her
room
she
wanted
to
be
alone
and
think
over
her
happiness
she
gazed
upon
the
on
her
finger
as
she
hid
the
away
safely
in
her
desk
my
husband
she
whispered
softly
nothing
can
part
us
now
nothing
but
death
no
one
can
come
between
us
now
never
while
we
live
hark
what
is
that
the
sound
of
voices
women
voices
fell
upon
her
ears
it
was
serena
and
her
mother
in
an
empty
room
adjoining
chamber
they
had
gone
there
for
a
private
conference
and
did
not
dream
that
she
would
overhear
mamma
beatrix
heard
serena
sibilant
voice
and
a
shudder
passed
over
her
i
know
all
the
whole
fearful
secret
at
last
and
beatrix
dane
will
never
marry
keith
kenyon
now
i
know
the
nature
of
the
awful
curse
which
descends
from
mildred
dane
upon
her
child
which
was
originally
transmitted
from
mildred
dane
south
american
ancestors
and
i
no
longer
envy
beatrix
her
beauty
better
be
the
ugliest
woman
in
the
land
than
the
thing
she
is
i
would
not
exchange
my
plain
face
were
it
ten
times
plainer
for
beatrix
dane
glorious
beauty
mother
listen
and
do
not
faint
or
cry
out
this
is
the
bad
black
secret
mildred
dane
inherited
the
awful
plague
of
leprosy
and
from
her
it
descends
to
her
child
beatrix
dane
chapter
xix
beatrix
hears
the
secret
silence
awful
silence
beatrix
could
hear
her
own
heart
beat
as
she
stood
there
alone
in
the
silence
and
darkness
of
her
own
chamber
the
hand
that
wears
keith
kenyon
pressed
against
her
madly
throbbing
heart
the
full
significance
of
the
words
to
which
she
has
just
listened
does
not
reach
her
understanding
she
does
not
fully
realize
their
awful
meaning
not
now
time
enough
for
that
later
when
the
numbness
is
gone
from
her
brain
and
she
has
the
courage
to
stand
face
to
face
with
the
bitter
the
awful
truth
she
stands
staring
straight
before
her
into
the
darkness
her
hand
pressing
against
her
heart
convulsively
holding
her
breath
to
hear
what
may
come
next
serena
voice
breaks
the
awful
silence
low
and
hissing
like
some
venomous
serpent
it
is
true
all
true
true
as
gospel
mamma
she
cried
exultantly
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
it
no
possibility
of
a
mistake
it
was
the
shock
of
discovering
the
horrible
truth
that
killed
my
father
you
know
he
just
idolized
beatrix
and
to
find
out
that
for
all
these
years
he
had
been
harboring
an
accursed
creature
like
that
whose
very
touch
may
be
pollution
for
no
one
can
tell
when
the
disease
may
break
out
in
the
system
simply
killed
him
mamma
the
story
is
true
there
is
no
doubt
of
it
this
frightful
disease
is
transmitted
from
generation
to
generation
and
is
incurable
but
perhaps
i
had
better
read
you
the
letter
demorest
says
that
it
is
a
terrible
revelation
which
ought
to
be
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
authorities
for
no
leper
should
be
allowed
to
go
at
large
in
the
streets
of
a
city
there
was
a
ring
of
satisfaction
in
serena
cold
voice
truly
if
love
is
as
strong
as
death
jealousy
is
as
hard
as
hell
and
knows
no
pity
but
serena
lynne
interposes
feebly
there
is
nothing
to
prove
that
this
terrible
disease
has
developed
in
beatrix
her
skin
is
as
fair
as
a
lily
a
wonderful
complexion
serena
groaned
complexion
was
her
hers
was
the
color
of
a
weak
solution
of
coffee
lynne
went
on
there
is
in
fact
as
yet
nothing
in
the
world
to
make
one
put
faith
in
the
statement
concerning
beatrix
do
let
your
jealous
hatred
of
the
girl
lead
you
astray
it
will
merely
precipitate
matters
and
you
will
have
to
prove
all
these
things
you
know
serena
mamma
you
must
think
me
an
idiot
of
course
i
expect
to
prove
all
that
i
assert
at
least
as
much
as
any
one
possibly
can
we
can
only
prove
that
mildred
dane
this
girl
mother
was
a
victim
of
the
plague
of
leprosy
and
any
physician
will
tell
you
that
no
child
of
a
leper
especially
when
the
leper
is
a
woman
can
possibly
escape
the
dark
inheritance
sit
down
there
in
that
mamma
and
let
me
read
you
the
letter
the
very
letter
that
killed
my
father
when
he
tossed
it
upon
the
fire
fate
decreed
that
it
should
not
be
consumed
fortunately
the
fire
was
low
and
papa
must
have
been
nearly
dead
when
he
attempted
to
destroy
the
letter
and
with
it
all
evidence
of
the
awful
curse
which
is
beatrix
dane
inheritance
but
i
found
the
scorched
fragments
of
the
letter
it
was
only
torn
in
four
pieces
and
i
put
them
safely
away
in
a
little
tin
box
when
we
came
down
here
to
new
orleans
some
impulse
prompted
me
to
bring
the
box
and
contents
with
me
i
had
heard
papa
speak
of
a
demorest
in
this
city
who
was
wonderfully
ingenious
and
successful
in
deciphering
and
restoring
old
papers
i
found
his
address
upon
a
card
among
papa
private
papers
and
i
brought
the
card
with
me
when
we
came
to
this
city
i
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
the
man
i
knew
that
it
would
cost
me
a
pretty
penny
so
it
did
it
has
taken
every
dollar
that
i
had
in
the
world
but
it
is
well
invested
i
am
more
than
repaid
for
the
outlay
for
oh
mamma
keith
kenyon
will
never
make
beatrix
dane
his
wife
now
never
listen
to
me
while
i
read
you
the
letter
it
is
from
old
bernard
dane
to
my
father
and
this
is
what
it
says
silence
once
more
broken
by
the
rustling
of
paper
as
serena
unfolds
the
fresh
sheet
upon
which
demorest
has
transcribed
the
contents
of
the
mutilated
letter
the
silence
of
the
very
grave
reigns
throughout
the
old
house
the
girl
in
the
other
room
has
thrown
herself
into
a
low
seat
and
crouches
there
like
some
hunted
creature
brought
to
bay
her
heart
overflowing
with
awful
and
bitter
anguish
a
suffering
so
intense
that
no
words
have
ever
been
framed
in
any
language
capable
of
expressing
it
a
cloud
of
horrible
darkness
and
despair
envelopes
her
she
can
see
no
ray
of
light
she
is
groping
in
the
gloom
still
unable
to
fully
comprehend
the
nature
of
this
wondrous
horror
that
has
come
into
her
life
she
will
realize
it
to
its
full
extent
by
and
by
loud
and
clear
and
with
a
ring
of
triumph
in
it
serena
voice
falls
upon
the
silence
once
more
as
she
reads
that
fatal
letter
aloud
reads
to
the
bitter
end
doctor
frederick
lynne
i
feel
it
is
my
duty
now
that
beatrix
is
grown
and
the
time
is
coming
for
me
to
remove
her
from
your
care
to
reveal
to
you
the
nature
of
the
terrible
future
in
store
for
her
the
dark
inheritance
which
must
inevitably
descend
upon
her
sooner
or
later
you
are
a
physician
and
a
scientific
scholar
and
you
will
comprehend
and
no
doubt
feel
intense
interest
in
this
strange
and
peculiar
case
let
me
go
back
a
generation
or
two
mildred
dane
the
mother
of
beatrix
was
a
miss
baretta
her
parents
were
south
americans
and
very
strange
and
eccentric
people
they
reared
mildred
who
was
an
only
child
in
the
strictest
privacy
and
the
girl
grew
up
in
ignorance
of
the
blight
which
was
destined
to
be
cast
upon
her
life
she
was
very
beautiful
and
very
too
easily
yielding
to
others
she
was
forced
by
her
parents
into
a
distasteful
marriage
with
godfrey
dane
an
old
man
but
very
wealthy
one
child
was
born
and
godfrey
dane
died
when
it
was
a
few
months
old
that
child
was
beatrix
little
beatrix
who
has
lived
with
you
all
her
life
i
pass
over
mildred
tragic
death
and
all
other
events
which
do
not
bear
directly
upon
the
fate
of
this
child
it
is
with
her
alone
i
wish
to
deal
lynne
i
am
going
to
tell
you
all
in
as
few
words
as
possible
before
her
death
poor
mildred
became
a
victim
of
leprosy
and
while
her
child
was
drawing
from
its
mother
breast
the
awful
incurable
plague
into
its
system
that
beatrix
will
escape
the
scourge
is
simply
impossible
but
it
seldom
makes
its
appearance
before
the
age
of
eighteen
it
may
be
a
little
later
or
a
little
earlier
but
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
that
age
so
until
she
reaches
eighteen
there
is
no
reason
to
fear
contagion
to
your
family
i
wish
you
to
send
beatrix
to
me
at
once
i
would
place
her
under
the
care
of
an
eminent
physician
but
all
efforts
will
prove
unavailing
there
is
no
hope
for
her
it
is
only
a
question
of
time
before
the
dread
disease
will
develop
in
her
system
send
her
to
me
at
once
you
will
find
a
letter
accompanying
this
which
will
be
explanation
enough
for
your
family
but
keep
this
letter
as
secret
as
the
grave
never
let
beatrix
dane
catch
a
glimpse
of
its
contents
or
the
knowledge
of
what
this
letter
contains
may
kill
her
outright
and
now
i
have
made
a
full
explanation
i
have
no
more
to
say
send
the
girl
to
me
and
your
responsibility
ceases
forever
yours
respectfully
bernard
dane
serena
voice
rang
out
clear
and
distinct
to
the
very
last
then
silence
settled
down
broken
by
lynne
good
heavens
in
an
voice
serena
this
is
horrible
do
you
think
there
was
any
danger
while
she
was
with
us
oh
what
if
we
have
been
exposed
to
this
dreadful
thing
i
wish
that
girl
was
dead
dead
and
buried
and
forgotten
i
hate
to
think
of
her
and
not
a
word
of
pity
for
the
hopeless
wretch
who
was
doomed
to
suffer
from
this
awful
curse
the
creature
in
the
adjoining
room
who
crouched
in
the
depths
of
the
and
listened
listened
eagerly
intently
to
every
word
that
serena
had
read
in
the
fatal
letter
not
a
word
or
a
cry
or
a
groan
passed
beatrix
dane
lips
as
she
crouched
there
and
over
her
a
great
darkness
settled
life
drifted
away
from
her
grasp
the
graceful
head
fell
forward
and
she
lost
consciousness
it
was
merciful
oblivion
but
it
was
destined
not
to
last
she
lifted
her
head
at
length
and
gazed
wildly
about
her
in
the
darkness
no
sound
reached
her
ears
the
next
room
was
as
silent
as
the
grave
lynne
and
serena
had
gone
to
their
own
apartments
to
talk
over
the
horrible
story
which
had
come
into
their
possession
beatrix
was
left
alone
alone
alas
she
felt
that
she
was
fated
to
be
alone
henceforth
and
forever
to
grope
among
dead
men
bones
to
live
like
the
lepers
of
old
in
deserted
tombs
to
be
an
outcast
forever
accursed
shunned
in
olden
times
the
leper
was
compelled
to
announce
his
own
approach
veiling
his
face
from
the
gaze
of
those
not
like
himself
accursed
and
to
cry
aloud
unclean
unclean
some
faint
fragments
of
history
strayed
through
the
girl
brain
as
she
sat
there
unable
to
realize
as
yet
the
full
depths
of
her
own
woe
she
had
read
of
leprosy
the
most
horrible
of
all
known
diseases
and
which
can
never
be
cured
when
once
the
plague
had
appeared
in
her
system
even
her
very
touch
would
be
pollution
good
god
she
had
kissed
keith
lips
over
and
over
what
if
what
if
she
had
transmitted
the
curse
to
him
better
for
her
to
die
than
to
bring
this
horrible
curse
upon
the
man
she
loved
she
knew
now
at
last
the
reason
for
her
own
isolation
in
bernard
dane
house
she
must
not
mix
too
intimately
with
other
uncursed
people
or
they
too
would
become
accursed
slowly
wearily
she
arose
to
her
feet
and
lighted
the
lamp
in
her
room
then
she
went
over
to
the
mirror
and
stood
gazing
upon
her
own
face
her
eyes
full
of
bitter
woe
she
could
see
no
change
there
as
yet
the
pearly
skin
was
as
fair
and
lovely
as
ever
the
beautiful
dark
eyes
just
as
bright
she
held
up
one
little
hand
and
let
the
gleam
across
it
it
was
fair
and
soft
and
untainted
yet
all
the
same
the
evil
might
lurk
unseen
like
a
poisonous
serpent
in
her
blood
and
when
it
became
known
it
would
be
too
late
too
late
and
oh
god
in
heaven
was
there
ever
such
a
fate
she
was
keith
kenyon
wedded
wife
she
had
cursed
his
life
she
had
brought
ruin
black
and
sure
upon
him
all
his
future
happiness
was
wrecked
and
destroyed
god
pity
me
i
am
lost
lost
she
moaned
bleakly
and
then
with
a
low
cry
of
anguish
the
slight
form
tottering
weakly
she
fell
to
the
floor
like
one
dead
chapter
xx
worse
than
death
hours
passed
before
beatrix
dane
returned
to
consciousness
and
a
realization
of
the
truth
she
lifted
her
head
and
sat
staring
into
the
darkness
trying
to
comprehend
this
awful
thing
that
had
come
upon
her
with
all
the
force
and
harshness
of
a
blow
oh
my
god
what
am
i
she
groaned
in
her
bitter
anguish
accursed
accursed
she
arose
and
went
over
to
the
window
and
stood
there
with
her
burning
cheek
pressed
against
the
pane
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
darkness
without
a
dreary
scene
the
wind
had
arisen
and
went
moaning
around
the
old
mansion
with
a
shrill
complaining
cry
which
sounded
like
some
human
creature
in
distress
and
made
the
blood
run
cold
in
the
poor
girl
veins
as
she
listened
it
sounded
like
a
the
of
all
hope
for
her
it
seemed
to
say
over
and
over
in
a
voice
of
dreary
mournful
melody
gone
hope
happiness
all
gone
there
is
nothing
in
life
for
you
poor
wretch
she
was
keith
kenyon
wife
and
she
had
brought
a
curse
upon
him
a
curse
which
could
never
be
lightened
or
lifted
she
was
dead
to
him
henceforth
and
forever
even
as
she
must
now
be
dead
to
all
hope
in
life
one
thought
was
ever
before
her
one
duty
was
plain
to
her
she
must
go
away
go
away
out
of
his
life
forever
even
though
it
should
kill
her
to
give
him
up
where
could
she
go
she
thought
of
the
cold
world
to
which
she
was
comparatively
a
stranger
and
a
shudder
passed
over
her
slender
frame
i
can
not
stay
here
she
said
resolutely
trying
to
be
very
brave
and
calm
i
must
not
expose
other
people
to
possible
contagion
i
will
go
away
and
leave
keith
and
he
will
be
free
once
more
but
oh
if
i
had
only
learned
this
hideous
secret
before
our
marriage
how
much
suffering
we
might
have
been
spared
she
thought
it
all
over
thought
until
her
brain
reeled
and
her
heart
beat
with
great
suffocating
throbs
which
nearly
strangled
her
where
could
she
go
what
door
was
open
to
receive
such
as
she
had
the
awful
plague
really
appeared
and
declared
itself
in
her
system
then
she
could
find
shelter
in
the
hospital
where
such
poor
wretches
take
refuge
she
had
heard
of
such
a
place
the
very
thought
of
it
was
enough
to
make
her
feel
faint
but
as
yet
there
was
no
trace
of
the
terrible
disease
no
proof
that
she
had
really
become
a
victim
to
its
horrors
there
was
only
the
fact
that
her
mother
had
transmitted
to
her
offspring
the
hideous
plague
which
must
sooner
or
later
manifest
itself
and
then
horrible
suffering
and
at
last
inevitable
death
she
wrung
her
hands
with
a
moan
of
bitter
anguish
was
any
one
ever
so
accursed
as
i
she
cried
desperately
oh
pitying
heaven
it
is
more
than
i
can
bear
at
last
she
made
up
her
mind
what
to
do
she
would
leave
bernard
dane
house
early
in
the
morning
she
must
not
remain
another
day
beneath
this
roof
she
would
go
direct
to
the
hospital
where
that
hideous
plague
was
treated
to
the
old
physician
who
had
it
in
charge
and
tell
her
pitiful
story
then
she
would
ask
permission
to
remain
there
and
wait
upon
the
unfortunate
creatures
whose
companionship
she
must
one
day
share
she
would
shut
herself
up
in
this
living
tomb
and
wait
for
death
to
release
her
because
there
was
no
other
shelter
for
such
as
she
no
one
would
dare
to
give
her
a
home
or
extend
a
helping
hand
to
a
wretch
like
beatrix
dane
i
suppose
that
there
never
was
another
case
like
this
in
the
world
young
beautiful
and
accursed
wedded
to
the
man
she
idolized
and
who
in
turn
worshiped
her
as
the
devotee
worships
the
saint
upon
a
shrine
all
the
world
before
her
yet
she
must
be
set
aside
as
a
pariah
a
horrible
thing
to
be
shunned
truly
the
sins
of
the
fathers
shall
be
visited
upon
the
children
the
world
would
be
better
and
cleaner
if
that
truth
would
be
remembered
and
taken
to
heart
all
night
long
the
poor
girl
crouched
in
the
darkness
thinking
brooding
over
her
unhappy
fate
all
night
long
what
a
night
it
was
it
will
never
be
forgotten
while
poor
beatrix
lives
how
could
she
go
away
like
that
without
a
word
of
or
a
farewell
kiss
to
the
husband
so
dearly
loved
oh
it
was
horrible
horrible
yet
she
must
not
risk
his
life
by
touching
his
lips
with
hers
perchance
her
own
were
already
polluted
with
the
fiery
wrath
of
the
coming
plague
that
curse
which
might
be
even
now
about
to
declare
itself
which
must
be
according
to
the
theory
of
all
authority
upon
that
subject
even
now
dormant
in
her
system
she
must
not
give
way
to
woman
weakness
she
must
go
go
without
a
word
or
a
look
or
a
touch
she
must
go
out
of
keith
life
forever
and
in
the
days
to
come
perhaps
when
she
was
dead
he
would
learn
the
hideous
truth
and
pity
her
a
little
no
matter
though
it
killed
her
she
must
not
risk
his
safety
by
a
kiss
she
must
go
go
alone
it
was
all
that
was
left
for
her
to
do
she
gathered
together
a
few
necessary
garments
and
packed
them
in
a
small
then
she
wrote
a
few
lines
to
keith
to
keith
her
love
this
man
for
whose
dear
sake
she
would
gladly
have
laid
down
her
life
yet
whom
she
was
leaving
forever
leaving
him
never
again
expecting
to
see
him
on
earth
she
was
as
dead
to
him
as
though
the
had
closed
over
her
and
shut
her
out
from
the
light
of
day
as
though
she
lay
at
rest
under
the
sod
surely
no
woman
ever
had
a
harder
task
an
almost
impossible
task
like
this
to
go
through
with
when
the
first
faint
streaks
of
day
began
to
appear
in
the
eastern
sky
beatrix
took
her
small
baggage
and
stole
from
the
room
on
the
table
she
left
the
letter
for
keith
sealed
and
addressed
to
his
name
she
stole
noiselessly
and
softly
unfastened
the
outer
door
she
passed
forth
and
beatrix
dane
was
homeless
she
glanced
up
at
the
old
house
lying
hushed
and
still
under
the
shadow
of
the
magnolias
my
husband
she
moaned
forever
it
is
worse
than
death
the
parting
that
divides
us
but
it
must
be
borne
i
am
accursed
accursed
she
pressed
her
lips
against
the
hard
oaken
panel
of
the
door
in
a
mute
farewell
she
had
not
dared
to
go
to
the
door
of
keith
chamber
for
fear
that
he
would
hear
her
and
all
would
be
discovered
how
could
she
bear
to
tell
him
all
just
yet
how
could
she
tell
him
her
sad
story
and
see
the
light
die
out
of
his
eyes
and
the
handsome
face
grow
pallid
with
suffering
no
she
was
not
strong
enough
yet
to
bear
the
ordeal
better
for
her
to
go
away
without
seeing
his
face
perhaps
never
to
see
it
again
while
she
lived
yet
she
would
have
given
her
life
willingly
for
just
one
kiss
from
his
dear
lips
but
that
can
never
be
now
never
again
can
she
look
into
his
dear
eyes
and
hear
him
speak
sweet
loving
words
to
her
life
was
over
and
done
with
now
and
nothing
was
left
but
the
darkness
of
the
grave
and
she
was
so
young
to
have
all
hope
killed
in
her
heart
like
that
she
hastened
away
without
another
backward
glance
making
a
brave
effort
to
be
calm
and
face
the
ordeal
before
her
the
hospital
was
a
long
distance
away
she
could
not
wait
for
the
hour
when
the
cars
would
begin
to
run
she
must
walk
it
so
she
did
faint
and
weary
not
having
eaten
anything
since
dinner
the
previous
day
she
walked
all
that
distance
and
when
at
last
she
reached
the
hospital
at
its
very
door
she
fell
to
the
ground
in
a
dead
swoon
chapter
xxi
the
next
day
keith
awoke
the
next
morning
with
a
strange
feeling
of
peace
and
quiet
in
his
heart
a
sensation
as
though
he
had
anchored
at
last
and
all
his
life
would
henceforth
lie
through
pleasant
ways
my
little
wife
he
murmured
fondly
i
shall
go
to
uncle
bernard
this
morning
and
tell
him
of
the
step
i
have
taken
i
shall
break
the
news
of
my
marriage
to
him
at
once
and
have
it
all
over
surely
he
can
not
in
his
heart
object
since
that
was
once
his
dearest
wish
his
pet
scheme
i
wonder
why
he
changed
his
mind
in
regard
to
the
projected
marriage
between
beatrix
and
myself
the
young
man
went
on
thoughtfully
as
he
performed
his
toilet
it
is
a
mystery
to
me
yet
uncle
bernard
is
very
eccentric
and
i
need
not
be
surprised
at
anything
that
he
may
do
or
say
oh
how
happy
we
shall
be
my
darling
and
i
and
if
uncle
bernard
is
really
displeased
i
will
take
her
away
and
we
will
find
some
pretty
little
cottage
and
i
will
get
a
position
somewhere
and
work
for
my
darling
my
little
wife
as
the
last
words
passed
his
lips
his
eyes
fell
upon
an
object
the
sight
of
which
made
him
frown
he
was
standing
near
the
window
and
the
object
which
had
attracted
his
attention
was
serena
lynne
walking
in
the
grounds
outside
she
was
dressed
in
black
all
in
deep
black
and
her
face
was
very
pale
and
wore
upon
it
a
look
which
keith
kenyon
had
never
seen
there
before
i
wonder
when
those
women
are
going
to
leave
he
exclaimed
half
aloud
i
am
tired
of
the
sight
of
them
and
serena
is
a
bitter
enemy
of
my
darling
i
feel
sure
of
that
dear
little
beatrix
how
can
any
one
dislike
her
she
is
the
gentlest
little
girl
in
the
whole
round
world
at
breakfast
he
looked
anxiously
for
beatrix
but
there
was
no
sign
of
her
she
did
not
make
her
appearance
old
bernard
dane
looked
uneasy
he
rang
the
bell
and
graves
appeared
send
to
miss
dane
room
he
commanded
and
see
if
she
is
ill
or
why
she
does
not
come
to
breakfast
beatrix
is
an
early
riser
he
added
glancing
at
keith
a
very
good
trait
observed
that
young
man
promptly
oh
yes
to
be
sure
intervened
serena
with
a
sneer
in
her
voice
which
she
could
not
repress
to
save
her
life
everything
beatrix
does
is
perfection
she
has
not
a
single
fault
very
true
responded
keith
gravely
looking
the
irate
lady
directly
in
the
face
she
certainly
has
never
been
guilty
of
sneering
over
the
absent
or
traducing
people
behind
their
backs
serena
face
grew
crimson
over
the
reproof
which
was
certainly
well
merited
she
turned
to
bernard
dane
my
mother
and
i
expect
to
start
for
the
north
she
announced
you
have
been
very
kind
to
us
dane
and
we
are
very
grateful
our
business
here
is
ended
and
she
did
not
finish
the
door
of
the
was
thrown
open
and
graves
crossed
the
threshold
looking
as
pale
as
if
she
had
just
seen
a
ghost
dane
oh
dane
miss
beatrix
is
not
here
and
her
bed
was
not
slept
in
last
night
everything
in
the
room
is
as
usual
only
a
small
and
some
of
her
plainer
clothing
are
missing
and
if
you
please
sir
i
found
this
upon
the
this
was
the
letter
which
poor
beatrix
had
left
there
addressed
to
keith
kenyon
pale
and
trembling
with
indefinable
horror
keith
broke
the
seal
and
read
these
words
keith
my
own
i
am
going
to
leave
you
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
i
love
you
but
i
am
going
to
leave
you
forever
there
is
a
reason
a
bad
black
bitter
reason
i
can
not
dare
not
write
or
speak
of
that
now
you
will
know
all
too
soon
and
when
you
know
your
heart
will
break
as
mine
has
do
not
seek
me
i
shall
be
in
the
very
last
place
that
you
will
think
of
searching
for
me
you
would
as
soon
think
of
looking
for
me
alive
in
the
dark
and
dreary
tomb
as
in
the
place
that
is
to
be
my
hereafter
i
have
done
no
wrong
my
darling
only
in
becoming
your
wife
if
i
could
i
would
devote
all
my
life
every
moment
of
it
to
you
and
to
making
you
happy
but
fate
cruel
and
relentless
fate
has
decreed
otherwise
and
we
must
part
never
to
meet
again
on
earth
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
but
yours
beatrix
he
read
the
letter
over
and
over
until
he
knew
it
by
heart
his
face
as
white
as
the
face
of
a
dead
man
his
eyes
full
of
piteous
suffering
then
he
arose
from
the
table
the
letter
clinched
in
one
cold
hand
his
form
shaking
like
a
leaf
uncle
bernard
in
a
low
tremulous
voice
may
i
see
you
alone
in
the
library
old
bernard
dane
went
straight
over
to
the
buffet
and
poured
a
of
brandy
from
a
decanter
which
stood
there
he
held
it
to
keith
lips
drink
that
my
boy
he
said
in
a
kindly
tone
you
look
done
up
now
come
to
the
library
i
am
at
your
service
as
the
door
of
the
closed
behind
the
two
serena
eyes
met
her
mother
gaze
and
a
smile
of
triumph
coiled
her
thin
lips
he
leaves
us
out
of
the
private
conference
she
said
in
a
cold
metallic
voice
and
the
foolish
boy
does
not
dream
that
we
know
more
about
this
mysterious
flitting
than
he
does
mamma
you
look
surprised
why
did
you
not
know
that
when
i
read
that
letter
aloud
to
you
last
night
beatrix
dane
was
in
the
next
room
and
heard
every
word
it
is
her
and
she
was
there
and
heard
every
word
that
i
read
i
meant
that
she
should
serena
even
lynne
was
horrified
at
this
heartless
announcement
it
is
true
mamma
as
true
as
gospel
she
returned
harshly
it
was
the
best
way
to
let
her
know
and
it
is
quite
time
that
she
should
know
i
have
been
sharp
and
shrewd
for
i
have
nipped
this
affair
between
her
and
keith
in
the
bud
the
day
will
come
when
keith
will
be
grateful
to
me
that
he
found
out
everything
before
it
was
too
late
he
is
awfully
cut
up
now
but
he
is
a
man
and
men
get
over
such
things
in
the
course
of
time
some
of
them
in
an
exceedingly
short
time
and
then
he
will
come
back
to
me
back
to
the
woman
who
has
sympathized
with
him
through
all
his
sorrows
one
thing
troubles
me
however
i
would
like
to
know
what
she
wrote
him
how
much
she
has
told
him
and
all
about
it
i
must
know
an
hour
later
serena
encountered
keith
kenyon
in
the
entrance
hall
at
sight
of
his
face
she
fell
back
with
a
cry
of
horror
it
was
awfully
ghastly
white
and
drawn
and
convulsed
with
suffering
his
eyes
were
dark
and
dilated
he
shook
like
a
decrepit
old
man
oh
keith
she
cried
pausing
and
laying
her
hand
on
his
arm
what
in
heaven
name
is
the
matter
are
you
grieving
over
poor
beatrix
well
she
has
gone
away
and
it
was
all
that
she
could
do
poor
child
one
can
not
help
pitying
her
from
the
depths
of
one
heart
tell
me
keith
have
you
heard
all
has
dane
told
you
all
the
awful
truth
concerning
poor
beatrix
keith
bowed
his
head
slowly
and
a
look
of
crept
into
his
eyes
he
has
told
me
all
he
moaned
and
i
oh
i
can
not
speak
of
it
now
but
keith
her
voice
full
of
triumph
which
she
can
not
restrain
you
should
be
glad
that
you
found
it
out
in
time
to
prevent
future
sorrow
to
you
both
his
eyes
rested
upon
the
woman
hard
cold
face
and
he
covered
his
own
with
his
hands
you
are
mistaken
he
said
in
a
voice
which
did
not
sound
like
his
own
the
warning
came
too
late
beatrix
and
i
were
married
yesterday
serena
she
is
my
own
dear
wife
chapter
xxii
sister
angela
the
moments
came
and
went
and
still
that
slight
figure
lay
upon
the
hospital
steps
the
small
face
as
white
and
rigid
as
though
she
were
dead
it
was
very
early
and
the
old
physician
in
charge
had
not
yet
made
his
appearance
at
the
hospital
and
the
wretched
inmates
dared
not
venture
forth
into
the
street
where
beatrix
dane
had
fallen
in
that
swoon
six
chimed
forth
from
a
distant
steeple
and
the
sun
was
lying
warm
and
bright
across
the
girl
pallid
face
when
a
light
footstep
sounded
upon
the
path
and
a
woman
bent
over
the
girl
prostrate
figure
a
sister
of
charity
one
of
those
good
and
holy
women
who
spend
their
lives
in
working
for
others
in
his
holy
name
and
who
alone
of
all
others
keep
themselves
unspotted
from
the
world
the
sister
passing
by
on
her
way
to
a
certain
charitable
institution
had
caught
sight
of
the
girl
lying
upon
the
hospital
steps
and
her
gentle
heart
had
prompted
her
to
stop
and
inquire
what
was
the
matter
she
stooped
and
peered
eagerly
into
the
girl
beautiful
white
face
the
great
dark
eyes
were
closed
and
she
was
to
all
appearances
dead
but
sister
angela
had
seen
too
much
suffering
in
her
life
too
many
cases
similar
in
some
respects
to
beatrix
dane
but
not
exactly
like
hers
for
surely
there
was
never
another
such
experience
in
the
world
sister
angela
uttered
a
cry
of
dismay
the
poor
child
she
is
young
and
fair
she
has
fainted
from
exhaustion
or
what
is
more
likely
she
is
in
deep
trouble
oh
yes
it
is
trouble
that
breaks
us
down
sooner
than
anything
else
it
is
far
worse
and
more
fatal
in
its
effects
than
the
most
severe
illness
sickness
of
the
heart
ah
that
is
incurable
sister
angela
lifted
the
girl
head
upon
her
breast
and
pushed
aside
the
veil
from
the
white
face
to
give
her
air
a
faint
sigh
passed
the
poor
girl
lips
and
consciousness
seemed
slowly
struggling
back
to
her
she
opened
her
sad
dark
eyes
and
they
met
the
pitying
gaze
of
sister
angela
blue
ones
where
am
i
moaned
the
girl
lifting
her
head
uncle
bernard
keith
oh
my
god
and
the
dreadful
truth
rushed
over
her
memory
like
a
flood
and
the
golden
head
drooped
once
more
and
an
awful
pallor
overspread
the
girlish
face
sister
angela
thought
she
was
going
to
faint
again
my
dear
she
said
in
her
soft
persuasive
voice
you
are
ill
and
in
trouble
tell
me
where
to
take
you
i
will
see
you
safely
to
your
home
and
friends
home
her
voice
full
of
bitterness
i
have
no
home
friends
is
there
such
a
thing
as
a
friend
a
real
friend
in
the
whole
world
if
we
find
none
here
on
earth
there
is
always
one
above
us
my
child
the
sister
answered
softly
we
must
turn
to
him
for
comfort
in
our
sorrow
nobody
else
can
help
us
believe
me
dear
who
are
you
i
am
sister
angela
a
sister
of
mercy
you
know
mercy
the
girl
voice
rang
out
in
a
bitter
cry
there
is
no
mercy
none
for
such
as
oh
sister
sister
tell
me
what
to
do
i
am
a
lost
wretch
lost
forever
not
in
the
sense
that
you
think
she
added
swiftly
noticing
the
expression
which
dawned
upon
the
calm
face
of
the
sister
i
have
done
no
intentional
wrong
committed
no
crime
but
i
have
married
a
good
man
and
have
brought
ruin
upon
his
whole
life
listen
to
my
story
it
is
brief
i
married
him
and
then
afterward
when
it
was
too
late
i
learned
that
a
dreadful
fate
is
in
store
for
me
that
i
am
by
inheritance
a
dark
inheritance
indeed
tainted
with
leprosy
my
child
the
sister
voice
trembled
perceptibly
surely
you
do
not
realize
what
you
are
saying
it
is
true
all
true
beatrix
went
on
swiftly
i
heard
the
truth
the
awful
truth
under
such
circumstances
that
i
can
not
doubt
it
and
all
the
surroundings
of
my
daily
life
prove
that
my
only
relative
knew
all
the
time
the
evil
that
threatened
me
but
for
some
reason
perhaps
through
mistaken
kindness
he
failed
to
let
me
know
the
worst
sister
i
am
accursed
sister
angela
shook
her
head
slowly
my
dear
nobody
is
so
accursed
that
the
love
and
pity
of
the
father
of
all
can
not
reach
them
but
i
have
had
experience
with
this
loathsome
disease
and
i
see
no
indications
of
it
in
you
as
yet
suppose
that
you
come
with
me
my
child
i
do
not
advise
you
to
enter
this
hospital
if
that
was
your
intention
and
doctor
davis
will
probably
refuse
to
receive
you
since
there
are
no
signs
of
the
disease
visible
upon
you
he
would
refuse
you
admittance
and
besides
the
daily
sight
of
these
poor
wretches
in
this
would
drive
you
mad
my
dear
be
advised
by
me
i
am
used
to
suffering
of
all
kinds
and
i
say
come
with
me
under
my
protection
i
am
attached
to
an
institution
for
the
sick
and
suffering
you
are
far
from
well
i
will
have
you
cared
for
and
when
you
feel
better
you
may
assist
me
in
the
sick
wards
there
is
always
work
for
willing
hands
and
a
strong
young
body
and
all
the
time
we
will
watch
you
narrowly
and
when
the
dark
day
comes
if
god
sees
fit
that
it
should
come
to
you
and
we
discover
that
this
awful
affliction
has
really
befallen
you
we
will
help
you
to
bear
it
and
then
not
until
then
you
shall
be
sent
to
this
refuge
will
you
take
my
advice
beatrix
lifted
her
eyes
to
the
face
god
must
have
sent
you
to
me
sister
she
sobbed
i
will
go
with
you
and
may
god
forever
bless
you
she
arose
with
some
difficulty
for
she
was
very
weak
the
sister
put
her
strong
arm
about
the
slender
waist
and
taking
beatrix
in
the
other
hand
led
the
girl
away
as
they
turned
their
backs
upon
the
gloomy
old
building
beatrix
shuddered
i
think
it
is
no
sin
to
pray
that
god
will
take
me
away
before
i
am
doomed
to
enter
there
she
said
softly
sister
angela
sighed
we
will
hope
for
the
best
she
returned
and
the
words
died
on
her
lips
beatrix
had
come
to
a
sudden
pause
grasping
the
sister
arm
in
a
fierce
grip
her
eyes
dilated
with
horror
see
she
panted
brokenly
must
i
oh
pitying
father
must
i
ever
be
like
that
they
were
passing
the
grounds
that
surrounded
the
lepers
hospital
unkempt
and
straggling
with
a
mournful
air
of
melancholy
pervading
them
of
what
use
to
furnish
pleasing
sights
to
attract
these
doomed
wretches
accursed
accursed
with
nothing
to
live
for
and
small
hope
in
the
afterward
peering
at
them
with
curious
eyes
from
behind
a
ragged
clump
of
shrubbery
a
creature
stood
not
many
feet
away
from
them
it
was
a
sight
to
be
remembered
while
beatrix
dane
had
life
good
heavens
was
that
horrible
caricature
of
a
human
being
alive
and
yet
this
woman
for
the
creature
resembled
a
woman
might
have
been
pretty
some
day
even
as
she
had
once
been
young
for
a
moment
beatrix
stood
like
one
petrified
an
awful
horror
in
her
eyes
which
were
riveted
upon
the
dreadful
sight
her
limbs
shaking
like
an
old
person
with
the
palsy
sister
angela
spoke
at
last
in
a
low
trembling
voice
my
dear
i
would
not
look
at
at
it
she
said
gently
do
not
fear
you
will
never
be
like
that
i
am
sure
of
it
that
woman
is
old
and
you
my
poor
child
will
not
live
to
be
old
i
am
sure
of
it
after
that
affliction
comes
upon
you
and
dear
only
think
god
may
have
pity
and
take
you
away
before
that
time
comes
beatrix
started
and
a
little
hope
flashed
into
her
eyes
sister
do
you
think
that
it
would
be
very
very
wrong
under
my
peculiar
circumstances
to
to
take
my
own
life
i
have
nothing
to
live
for
my
dear
sister
angela
voice
rang
out
in
wild
distress
never
think
of
such
a
thing
again
she
cried
oh
believe
me
my
dear
you
had
better
suffer
all
the
sorrows
of
this
life
and
bear
all
its
burdens
in
patience
knowing
that
after
the
cross
the
crown
but
suicide
is
an
unpardonable
sin
in
the
eyes
of
god
never
think
of
it
again
my
dear
i
beg
of
you
now
lean
on
me
and
i
will
take
you
to
the
car
we
will
go
straight
to
the
home
to
which
i
am
taking
you
a
home
that
god
has
provided
for
you
there
you
will
find
rest
for
the
present
and
work
for
the
future
and
god
will
help
you
to
bear
your
burden

ever
a
man
lived
in
the
world
with
a
broken
heart
keith
kenyon
was
the
man
he
was
utterly
prostrated
life
seemed
at
an
end
to
him
he
had
no
hope
no
ambition
the
woman
he
loved
his
own
dear
wife
was
gone
from
him
forever
and
with
an
awful
curse
resting
upon
her
life
an
inheritance
of
woe
which
was
liable
to
descend
upon
her
head
at
any
moment
and
she
had
gone
from
him
gone
in
all
the
bitterness
of
her
awful
anguish
out
into
the
cold
world
where
he
could
not
dared
not
think
suppose
that
she
had
taken
her
life
into
her
own
hands
that
she
was
even
now
lying
at
the
bottom
of
the
mississippi
that
great
and
mighty
stream
which
has
borne
away
upon
its
ceaseless
current
so
many
of
the
creatures
of
this
world
who
weary
of
life
and
tired
of
its
heavy
burdens
cast
themselves
into
the
murky
waters
of
the
river
and
their
souls
are
hurried
before
their
maker
there
to
account
for
the
of
their
lives
at
first
keith
was
in
a
sort
of
lethargy
of
despair
he
sat
for
hours
in
his
room
never
moving
never
looking
up
sitting
with
his
head
upon
his
hand
buried
in
deep
thought
awful
to
all
appearances
he
was
dead
to
the
things
of
this
world
and
oblivious
of
all
that
was
taking
place
in
his
own
room
old
bernard
dane
lay
upon
a
he
had
given
up
and
taken
to
his
bed
when
the
news
of
beatrix
disappearance
was
first
announced
and
he
seemed
likely
never
to
arise
the
days
went
by
and
lynne
and
serena
still
lingered
at
the
dane
mansion
which
was
in
reality
a
house
of
mourning
now
poor
graves
was
quite
at
her
wits
end
in
all
this
trouble
and
she
had
begged
the
lynnes
to
remain
as
this
was
just
what
serena
fully
intended
doing
it
was
of
course
easily
arranged
on
the
morning
of
the
day
after
beatrix
flight
from
the
dane
mansion
keith
came
into
his
uncle
room
and
sat
down
beside
the
bed
uncle
bernard
he
began
i
must
try
to
find
her
the
shock
of
her
disappearance
has
been
so
great
so
overwhelming
that
i
have
been
benumbed
i
feel
like
one
groping
in
the
dark
but
now
i
am
awake
and
i
see
that
the
child
may
be
in
great
danger
i
must
search
for
her
and
find
her
if
she
is
living
if
not
if
she
is
dead
i
will
go
away
away
from
louisiana
forever
the
old
man
uttered
a
cry
of
distress
keith
keith
my
boy
he
moaned
you
will
surely
not
do
that
you
would
not
go
and
leave
the
old
man
to
die
alone
oh
heaven
what
have
i
done
that
i
should
be
punished
so
and
deserted
in
my
old
age
the
words
touched
keith
heart
and
made
it
ache
he
seized
the
old
man
wrinkled
hand
and
pressed
it
warmly
no
uncle
bernard
he
said
slowly
i
will
not
go
and
leave
you
i
will
never
leave
you
while
you
live
but
i
must
search
for
beatrix
i
must
know
whether
she
is
living
or
dead
if
she
is
still
alive
i
must
know
where
she
is
and
she
must
be
provided
for
you
will
help
me
uncle
bernard
i
will
my
boy
i
will
indeed
we
will
devote
our
lives
to
that
end
we
have
wasted
precious
time
already
go
at
once
keith
ah
if
i
were
well
and
able
to
accompany
you
keith
left
the
house
his
mind
absorbed
with
the
one
hope
of
finding
his
lost
darling
poor
child
his
first
step
was
to
insert
advertisements
in
all
the
daily
papers
a
few
words
beatrix
come
home
no
matter
what
may
come
i
will
protect
you
but
alas
poor
beatrix
was
destined
never
to
see
the
advertisements
and
even
had
she
seen
them
she
would
not
have
obeyed
the
request
for
she
dared
not
risk
the
lives
of
other
people
in
that
reckless
fashion
keith
next
step
was
to
place
the
matter
in
the
hands
of
a
skilled
detective
then
impelled
by
a
strange
intuition
he
visited
the
lepers
hospital
for
well
he
knew
beatrix
dane
and
her
sensitive
nature
and
the
conviction
had
crept
into
his
heart
that
she
would
fly
to
this
refuge
believing
herself
accursed
and
intuition
as
is
apt
to
be
the
case
was
correct
in
this
instance
yet
as
we
already
know
keith
was
destined
to
fail
in
his
search
the
old
physician
in
attendance
at
the
hospital
was
of
course
in
perfect
ignorance
of
the
existence
of
beatrix
and
so
relieved
anxiety
upon
that
score
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
knowledge
that
beatrix
was
incarcerated
in
that
horrible
place
would
kill
him
outright
he
returned
home
heartsick
and
despairing
yet
conscious
of
a
feeling
of
gratitude
and
relief
that
he
had
not
found
her
there
he
repeated
to
old
bernard
dane
the
result
of
his
search
and
the
old
man
wept
bitter
tears
he
was
very
weak
and
childish
now
all
the
old
harshness
had
disappeared
forever
and
he
was
not
at
all
like
the
old
man
he
had
been
so
short
a
time
ago
we
must
find
her
keith
he
sobbed
and
i
will
devote
my
life
what
is
left
of
it
to
her
care
i
am
old
and
my
days
will
soon
be
ended
here
on
earth
but
i
can
devote
the
remnant
of
my
life
to
no
higher
or
better
object
than
the
care
of
this
unfortunate
child
and
when
that
awful
affliction
falls
upon
her
i
will
be
with
her
to
help
her
to
bear
it
oh
how
wicked
how
cruel
how
sinful
i
have
been
to
her
my
mildred
little
child
oh
will
god
ever
forgive
me
he
wept
like
a
weak
woman
overcome
with
the
full
weight
of
his
sorrow
and
remorse
and
in
the
midst
of
his
grief
he
found
an
unexpected
comforter
keith
having
been
summoned
from
his
side
serena
slipped
softly
into
the
room
and
came
to
the
old
man
bedside
dane
she
began
in
a
sympathetic
tone
let
me
try
to
cheer
you
a
little
do
not
grieve
over
poor
lost
beatrix
poor
child
we
will
find
her
and
restore
her
to
her
home
or
or
if
the
awful
curse
must
come
upon
her
we
will
do
all
in
our
power
to
alleviate
her
sufferings
do
not
grieve
so
dane
let
me
bathe
your
head
with
cologne
water
and
do
try
and
sleep
a
little
will
you
not
the
old
man
smiled
grimly
you
may
do
as
you
like
he
made
answer
i
am
completely
prostrated
so
serena
went
to
work
and
bathed
the
old
man
throbbing
temples
and
made
him
comfortable
at
last
his
eyes
closed
and
his
slow
regular
breathing
announced
that
he
was
asleep
serena
face
wore
a
look
of
triumph
and
her
pale
blue
eyes
flashed
with
exultation
why
not
she
muttered
low
under
her
breath
why
not
he
is
very
rich
and
very
old
and
i
must
have
money
and
keith
will
never
care
for
me
and
he
is
married
to
that
wretched
girl
who
will
be
a
about
his
neck
while
she
lives
and
she
may
live
many
years
i
am
not
sure
but
that
i
have
solved
the
problem
for
myself
and
found
a
way
an
unexpected
way
out
of
my
difficulties
keith
love
the
love
of
the
only
man
on
earth
worth
having
can
never
be
mine
never
it
is
useless
to
aspire
to
hope
but
why
should
i
spoil
all
my
life
for
the
sake
of
a
love
that
can
never
be
mine
i
will
not
do
it
i
will
put
forth
all
efforts
now
to
a
special
end
and
live
henceforth
for
that
one
purpose
i
must
have
money
i
will
marry
old
bernard
dane
and
be
rich
and
her
pale
eyes
shining
like
glass
i
will
thus
control
the
fortune
which
keith
kenyon
expects
to
inherit
oh
it
will
be
a
game
worth
playing
and
i
will
play
it
even
though
i
am
destined
to
be
beaten
at
the
game
it
was
an
idea
worthy
of
the
brain
from
which
it
emanated
and
a
scheme
which
would
not
have
occurred
to
any
one
else
serena
was
desperate
she
had
lost
her
game
but
money
she
must
have
and
she
had
devised
a
scheme
by
which
to
secure
it
it
was
not
an
original
idea
but
there
was
no
reason
why
it
should
not
succeed
for
old
bernard
dane
was
completely
broken
down
now
a
perfect
wreck
a
mere
ghost
of
the
aggressive
old
man
who
had
been
guilty
of
plotting
as
he
had
done
against
the
life
and
happiness
of
the
two
who
after
all
he
held
most
dear
sorely
he
was
being
punished
severely
fearfully
punished
for
his
wicked
scheme
to
marry
those
two
young
people
when
he
believed
that
only
ruin
could
come
of
the
marriage
ah
believe
me
we
who
sin
must
suffer
for
our
sins
i
think
that
old
bernard
dane
realized
this
truth
at
last
and
so
serena
laid
her
plot
and
went
to
work
with
a
will
she
must
have
money
for
her
funds
were
nearly
exhausted
and
her
mother
was
not
much
better
off
real
poverty
stared
them
in
the
face
and
here
right
before
her
was
the
possibility
of
retrieving
her
fallen
fortunes
and
securing
a
grand
home
for
herself
and
her
mother
and
better
than
all
else
to
a
narrow
nature
like
hers
it
would
be
opening
a
road
to
the
ruin
of
keith
kenyon
and
to
wreak
upon
him
a
dire
and
speedy
vengeance
he
would
not
love
her
he
would
not
make
her
his
wife
he
had
discarded
her
for
the
pretty
face
of
another
woman
had
cast
her
off
coldly
well
she
would
marry
old
bernard
dane
and
possess
the
great
dane
fortune
then
keith
kenyon
might
look
out
for
himself
to
a
nature
like
serena
lynne
this
was
a
glorious
triumph
she
little
dreamed
how
in
the
dark
days
to
come
she
would
bitterly
regret
having
ever
made
this
decision
chapter

an

in

seemed

hope
of
her
recovery
she
had
not
told
sister
angela
her
name
therefore
no
one
at
the
institution
was
able
to
identify
her
and
although
the
physician
in
charge
of
beatrix
saw
the
advertisement
which
keith
had
inserted
in
the
newspapers
how
could
he
guess
that
the
beatrix
who
was
implored
to
return
to
k
was
the
very
patient
in
whom
the
physician
was
becoming
strangely
interested
all
that
he
did
know
concerning
her
history
was
what
sister
angela
had
repeated
to
him
and
of
course
the
information
was
meager
enough
for
in
her
misery
poor
beatrix
had
not
felt
inclined
to
confide
absolutely
but
the
physician
saw
for
himself
how
beautiful
the
girl
was
and
that
she
was
a
refined
and
delicate
lady
and
his
interest
grew
and
flourished
sister
angela
confided
in
doctor
darrow
the
outlines
of
the
case
as
far
as
she
herself
knew
that
is
in
regard
to
her
strange
inheritance
doctor
darrow
face
grew
pale
as
death
and
his
gray
eyes
dilated
with
horror
until
they
were
as
dark
as
night
it
can
not
be
possible
he
exclaimed
it
seems
incredible
we
will
keep
her
secluded
from
every
one
else
here
and
i
will
study
her
case
in
my
spare
moments
you
are
aware
that
i
am
devoting
myself
to
the
study
of
this
horrible
disease
and
this
will
be
a
grand
opportunity
to
test
some
of
my
theories
in
regard
to
the
matter
heaven
help
her
poor
child
and
she
is
so
young
and
beautiful
i
wonder
where
her
home
is
and
who
she
is
but
beatrix
in
her
delirium
raved
in
such
incoherent
phrases
that
no
one
could
find
a
clew
to
her
identity
her
name
or
former
home
it
was
all
about
the
sorrow
of
a
parting
a
parting
from
some
loved
one
which
she
expressed
in
her
wild
ravings
and
although
douglas
darrow
passed
nearly
all
his
time
at
her
bedside
he
could
find
nothing
tangible
to
guide
him
in
a
search
for
the
friends
of
the
unfortunate
girl
douglas
darrow
was
young
and
handsome
an
enthusiast
in
his
profession
he
was
all
alone
in
the
world
and
the
possessor
of
a
fair
fortune
he
grew
deeply
interested
in
his
mysterious
patient
and
ere
he
had
realized
the
truth
he
found
himself
crossing
the
boundary
that
separates
friendly
interest
from
the
fatal
passion
of
love
but
poor
beatrix
tossing
in
wild
delirium
upon
her
white
bed
was
deaf
and
blind
to
everything
around
her
to
human
eyes
it
seemed
better
for
her
to
pass
away
now
and
drift
down
the
dark
river
of
death
into
the
great
unknown
but
the
father
who
guides
and
directs
us
had
his
own
plans
for
her
future
and
so
poor
beatrix
did
not
die
she
struggled
back
to
consciousness
one
day
and
as
the
great
dark
eyes
opened
slowly
they
fell
upon
the
face
of
doctor
darrow
who
was
seated
at
her
bedside
keith
she
faltered
trying
to
arise
but
the
effort
was
too
much
and
her
head
fell
back
upon
the
pillow
and
she
fainted
away
her
constitution
seemed
entirely
broken
down
and
her
long
illness
preceded
by
that
awful
shock
which
had
ruined
her
whole
life
had
left
her
weak
to
bear
the
heavy
burden
douglas
darrow
soon
restored
her
to
consciousness
and
administered
a
sleeping
potion
she
sank
at
last
into
a
refreshing
slumber
and
the
young
physician
began
to
hope
that
she
might
be
saved
if
she
awakens
in
her
senses
with
her
reason
unclouded
he
said
to
sister
angela
who
stood
gazing
sadly
down
upon
the
weak
little
sufferer
she
will
recover
i
think
i
am
positive
but
she
must
not
have
the
least
excitement
no
questions
must
be
asked
her
she
must
not
be
annoyed
in
any
way
or
we
will
not
be
able
to
save
her
yet
after
all
he
went
on
tremulously
it
seems
better
that
she
should
go
now
only
think
of
the
future
in
store
for
her
our
father
in
heaven
knows
best
returned
sister
angela
softly
we
can
afford
to
leave
it
all
in
his
hands
the
young
man
turned
aside
with
something
like
a
sob
you
are
an
angel
he
cried
the
world
would
be
purer
and
better
if
there
were
more
women
like
you
when
one
looks
about
and
sees
the
women
of
the
world
the
and
simpering
dolls
of
society
then
turns
to
the
pure
white
lives
of
those
like
sister
angela
one
can
not
fail
to
echo
douglas
darrow
words
to
visit
the
fatherless
and
the
widow
in
their
affliction
and
to
keep
ourselves
unspotted
from
the
world
this
was
sister
angela
but
with
all
her
prudence
and
forethought
sister
angela
had
forgotten
to
mention
to
the
young
physician
the
fact
of
beatrix
marriage
and
looking
at
the
girl
so
young
and
childish
no
one
would
be
surprised
that
the
fact
had
escaped
her
memory
and
sister
angela
never
once
in
her
unworldliness
remembered
the
proneness
of
young
men
to
fall
in
love
and
that
love
comes
when
least
expected
and
is
as
speedy
of
growth
ofttimes
as
was
jonah
gourd
and
alas
sometimes
withers
as
soon
beautiful
ephemeral
love
well
without
it
life
would
be
dreary
enough
and
surely
it
is
given
to
mortals
as
a
foretaste
of
paradise
only
there
love
will
live
without
the
immeasurable
sadness
which
it
too
often
has
on
earth
slowly
beatrix
recovered
she
felt
no
desire
to
live
for
what
was
there
to
live
for
on
earth
but
as
is
so
often
the
case
when
a
sick
person
cares
little
for
life
she
grew
daily
stronger
and
better
sister
angela
was
a
devoted
nurse
and
doctor
darrow
seemed
only
to
exist
in
beatrix
presence
yet
all
that
he
knew
of
her
history
was
that
her
name
was
beatrix
when
at
last
she
was
able
to
sit
up
and
amuse
herself
one
of
the
attendants
brought
her
some
magazines
wrapped
in
a
copy
of
one
of
the
daily
papers
now
a
month
old
beatrix
turned
the
paper
over
with
listless
fingers
and
was
about
to
lay
it
aside
when
her
eyes
fell
upon
a
notice
the
very
advertisement
which
keith
had
inserted
with
wild
dilated
eyes
beatrix
read
the
advertisement
to
the
end
then
with
a
low
cry
she
bowed
her
head
upon
her
hands
and
burst
into
tears
there
was
the
sound
of
a
firm
footstep
a
moment
later
douglas
darrow
bent
over
her
and
took
her
wasted
form
in
his
arms
beatrix
beatrix
he
whispered
look
up
and
hear
what
i
have
to
say
you
must
not
shed
tears
my
beautiful
darling
oh
beatrix
i
love
you
so
come
to
me
and
be
my
wife
i
can
not
live
without
you
i
will
shield
you
from
all
ill
and
if
suffering
must
come
upon
you
i
will
devote
my
life
trying
to
alleviate
your
suffering
tell
me
beatrix
will
you
try
to
care
for
me
i
am
years
old
but
i
have
never
really
loved
any
woman
before
and
i
would
lay
down
my
life
to
call
you
mine
answer
me
darling
will
you
try
to
love
me
a
little
chapter
xxv
how
the
game
is
played
for
a
moment
it
seemed
to
beatrix
that
she
could
not
have
heard
aright
her
brain
was
giddy
her
breath
came
fluttering
feebly
she
looked
as
if
she
was
going
to
swoon
doctor
darrow
practiced
eye
marked
the
change
in
his
patient
at
once
and
he
started
with
a
low
cry
of
alarm
good
heavens
he
exclaimed
wildly
what
have
i
done
oh
beatrix
beatrix
do
not
mind
me
i
was
mad
to
speak
to
you
of
such
things
now
when
you
are
so
weak
and
ill
forgive
me
darling
i
will
not
err
in
that
way
again
i
promise
not
to
refer
to
the
subject
again
until
you
are
strong
enough
to
listen
a
faint
shudder
passed
over
the
sick
girl
wasted
frame
her
eyes
shone
like
stars
but
she
had
made
up
her
mind
in
a
moment
that
no
matter
how
it
might
excite
her
and
retard
her
recovery
she
must
speak
out
now
and
tell
him
all
this
good
kind
heart
this
truly
noble
man
who
was
willing
to
devote
his
life
to
her
service
yet
knew
all
her
dread
secret
and
yet
how
little
could
he
do
could
any
human
being
do
to
help
her
doctor
darrow
she
said
laying
her
little
wasted
hand
upon
his
arm
i
must
speak
now
i
must
tell
you
the
truth
and
prevent
any
further
misunderstanding
you
must
not
speak
to
me
of
love
or
marriage
even
even
if
i
were
not
the
afflicted
creature
that
i
am
it
is
wrong
it
is
sinful
to
do
so
for
i
am
the
wife
of
another
man
he
started
with
a
low
cry
biting
his
lip
until
the
blood
came
all
the
color
faded
from
his
face
and
his
gray
eyes
grew
black
as
night
with
anguish
he
turned
aside
as
though
to
leave
the
room
then
he
came
back
to
the
window
near
which
beatrix
was
sitting
and
sank
upon
a
sofa
that
stood
near
the
room
was
as
still
as
death
he
could
not
collect
his
thoughts
enough
to
speak
he
sat
trembling
like
a
leaf
at
last
i
beg
you
to
forgive
me
he
said
in
a
shaking
voice
i
had
no
right
to
speak
of
such
things
to
you
until
i
had
first
learned
you
were
free
of
course
no
one
looking
at
a
child
like
you
would
imagine
that
you
were
a
married
woman
i
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
you
know
that
i
meant
no
insult
beatrix
her
great
dark
eyes
met
his
gaze
with
a
look
of
earnest
gratitude
you
why
you
have
saved
my
life
though
that
life
is
not
perhaps
worth
saving
she
added
sadly
oh
doctor
darrow
you
have
been
so
good
and
kind
to
me
i
can
never
thank
you
enough
but
of
course
this
of
which
you
speak
can
never
be
if
you
wish
i
will
tell
you
my
sad
story
i
would
be
grateful
for
your
confidence
he
returned
and
will
guard
it
as
sacred
i
wish
i
could
help
you
in
this
awful
trouble
i
can
only
watch
you
well
and
study
your
case
to
which
i
promise
to
devote
all
my
faculties
i
have
devoted
much
of
my
time
to
the
study
of
this
strange
disease
and
the
tests
by
which
its
existence
in
the
system
is
first
detected
and
proven
ah
well
he
rose
as
he
spoke
stifling
a
weary
sigh
at
least
i
shall
have
that
one
object
left
in
life
it
is
something
worth
living
for
he
left
the
room
and
beatrix
was
alone
with
her
own
dreary
thoughts
all
the
future
looked
dark
and
dismal
enough
and
it
seemed
to
the
poor
girl
that
there
could
never
again
be
a
ray
of
light
to
shine
upon
her
darkened
pathway
never
any
more
she
bowed
her
head
and
wept
bitter
tears
but
somehow
they
seemed
to
relieve
her
and
after
a
time
she
felt
stronger
and
better
here
sister
angela
found
her
and
sat
down
to
converse
with
the
sick
girl
upon
the
affairs
of
the
institution
speaking
to
her
of
cases
where
the
patients
suffered
more
in
mind
than
body
and
trying
her
best
to
interest
beatrix
in
these
poor
creatures
as
soon
as
you
are
strong
enough
my
dear
the
good
sister
said
gently
we
will
take
you
into
the
different
wards
and
let
you
see
how
people
suffer
and
still
live
there
is
nothing
better
to
cure
one
of
mourning
and
repining
over
one
own
sad
fate
the
sorrow
which
is
inevitable
than
to
witness
the
sorrow
of
others
and
to
help
the
helpless
to
bear
their
heavy
burdens
oh
beatrix
truly
that
is
worth
living
for
a
comforter
blessed
are
the
comforters
beatrix
lifted
her
head
and
taking
the
sister
hand
pressed
it
warmly
her
sad
heart
was
somehow
strengthened
and
she
made
up
her
mind
to
try
and
bear
her
burden
bravely
and
in
helping
others
and
comforting
and
caring
for
those
who
were
sick
and
in
distress
she
would
find
her
life
work
a
few
weeks
later
beatrix
was
pronounced
able
to
go
into
the
sick
wards
as
assistant
to
the
trained
nurses
waiting
upon
them
and
obeying
their
instructions
once
accustomed
to
the
routine
to
the
strange
sad
sights
and
sounds
beatrix
gave
her
whole
attention
to
it
she
threw
all
her
heart
and
strength
and
energy
into
the
task
before
her
the
work
which
god
had
placed
in
her
hands
to
stand
between
her
and
despair
and
devoted
herself
to
the
noble
work
in
the
meantime
at
the
old
dane
mansion
serena
was
working
hard
to
attain
the
desire
of
her
heart
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
become
bernard
dane
if
it
were
within
the
power
of
a
human
being
to
accomplish
it
and
to
that
end
she
labored
industriously
and
assiduously
she
made
herself
so
necessary
to
the
sick
man
comfort
that
old
bernard
dane
soon
began
to
think
that
he
had
judged
her
too
harshly
and
that
there
was
some
good
in
serena
after
all
she
was
constantly
at
his
of
course
her
mother
and
graves
both
shared
her
task
for
the
proprieties
must
be
observed
but
still
serena
was
the
real
head
of
the
house
and
to
her
the
others
began
after
a
time
to
look
for
direction
and
now
the
managing
part
of
nature
became
manifest
she
proved
a
splendid
business
and
household
directress
and
bernard
dane
began
to
look
up
to
her
with
a
feeling
of
admiration
and
to
declare
that
she
was
a
very
superior
woman
poor
keith
never
dreaming
of
the
contingency
which
was
looming
up
in
the
near
future
went
about
the
house
with
a
listless
preoccupied
air
his
face
pale
and
troubled
his
eyes
wearing
a
look
of
he
paid
no
heed
to
the
palpable
scheme
which
serena
had
formed
and
which
was
apparently
on
the
road
to
success
the
game
which
was
being
played
before
his
very
eyes
for
he
had
too
much
else
to
think
about
and
his
own
sorrow
occupied
him
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
but
graves
had
her
eyes
opened
suddenly
one
day
she
entered
the
in
haste
on
some
necessary
errand
and
found
serena
kneeling
at
the
bedside
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
old
man
ugly
face
with
a
rapt
eager
look
i
have
thought
a
great
deal
of
you
ever
since
we
first
met
serena
was
saying
and
the
old
housekeeper
caught
the
words
as
she
crossed
the
threshold
yes
yes
returned
the
old
man
hastily
but
i
am
too
old
to
think
of
marriage
now
serena
we
will
not
discuss
that
at
present
very
well
serena
arose
to
her
feet
with
an
air
of
resignation
then
turning
sharply
about
she
encountered
graves
what
do
you
want
demanded
serena
harshly
the
old
woman
face
wore
a
look
of
angry
displeasure
i
came
here
on
business
with
dane
she
returned
coldly
not
with
you
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
lynne
but
i
really
do
think
that
you
are
overreaching
yourself
somewhat
and
playing
a
dangerous
game
but
it
will
be
useless
here
she
added
freezingly
for
dane
is
a
man
of
good
sense
although
he
is
old
and
feeble
serena
made
no
reply
she
did
not
wish
to
provoke
a
controversy
right
there
in
the
presence
of
the
old
man
for
then
of
course
her
plot
would
miscarry
her
scheme
be
doubtless
brought
to
grief
and
her
case
was
growing
more
desperate
day
by
day
the
old
home
in
massachusetts
had
finally
been
sold
and
the
small
amount
which
remained
over
after
all
the
debts
were
settled
was
meager
enough
to
make
serena
heart
contract
with
slow
horror
at
the
thought
of
a
possible
old
age
in
some
and
lynne
lived
in
daily
and
hourly
dread
of
the
day
that
would
see
them
utterly
penniless
time
went
on
and
serena
tried
to
keep
up
heart
and
courage
and
worked
hard
at
her
scheme
of
besieging
the
old
man
heart
but
it
was
a
difficult
task
for
her
to
hope
to
reach
that
heart
incrusted
as
it
was
with
worldliness
selfishness
and
hardness
a
real
chinese
puzzle
to
serena
but
with
a
zeal
worthy
of
a
better
cause
she
kept
on
in
the
road
which
she
had
marked
out
for
herself
she
had
succeeded
in
making
her
presence
indispensable
to
bernard
dane
he
had
long
since
learned
to
rely
upon
her
and
to
look
to
her
for
advice
and
comfort
to
soothe
his
sufferings
and
to
cheer
and
console
him
in
his
dreary
moments
in
short
she
had
with
the
greatest
tact
and
skill
made
herself
a
regular
sunbeam
in
the
darksome
a
ray
of
sunlight
to
brighten
the
old
man
gloom
and
more
than
all
a
sure
road
to
the
heart
of
a
man
she
had
made
herself
a
household
necessity
just
when
she
had
succeeded
in
making
herself
indispensable
to
bernard
dane
just
when
he
grew
to
expect
her
coming
to
cheer
his
dreary
when
he
began
to
rely
upon
her
as
a
watcher
a
gentle
tireless
nurse
serena
was
a
born
nurse
when
he
had
begun
to
believe
that
there
was
no
comfort
in
the
whole
world
for
him
which
hand
could
not
bestow
when
he
had
come
to
a
stage
where
he
would
miss
the
caressing
touch
of
her
gentle
hands
bathing
his
brow
and
arranging
his
pillow
the
voice
which
had
lost
its
shrill
tones
and
now
spoke
only
in
a
low
sweet
way
when
he
in
short
had
begun
to
look
to
serena
for
every
comfort
then
then
came
a
blank
a
dull
dreary
blank
for
serena
suddenly
disappeared
and
when
the
old
man
in
querulous
tones
demanded
of
his
housekeeper
the
cause
of
her
absence
graves
informed
him
that
serena
worn
out
with
watching
and
nursing
was
very
ill
and
confined
to
her
own
room
chapter
xxvi
a
well
laid
plot
two
or
three
days
dragged
by
they
seemed
to
poor
old
bernard
dane
lying
upon
his
bed
of
suffering
to
really
drag
they
were
so
long
and
uneventful
every
morning
the
first
question
asked
graves
was
how
is
serena
and
graves
would
wisely
stifle
her
righteous
wrath
and
answer
quietly
about
the
same
sir
the
old
man
anxiety
as
well
as
loneliness
grew
and
flourished
it
would
have
retarded
his
recovery
but
that
he
became
suddenly
possessed
with
a
determination
to
get
well
and
as
his
illness
had
really
been
more
due
to
sorrow
and
remorse
than
to
any
bodily
ailment
he
was
soon
able
to
sit
up
and
at
last
wrapped
in
a
reclined
upon
a
sofa
in
his
large
cheerful
room
he
took
care
to
send
friendly
messages
to
serena
every
day
and
eagerly
waited
for
the
time
when
she
would
be
able
to
return
to
him
it
was
true
strange
as
it
may
appear
that
old
bernard
dane
wise
and
astute
clever
and
shrewd
had
actually
fallen
in
love
with
shrewish
serena
lynne
wonders
will
never
cease
in
this
strange
old
world
of
ours
and
the
very
last
thing
down
on
the
cards
had
befallen
old
bernard
dane
and
yet
it
was
not
so
wonderful
after
all
give
any
clever
designing
woman
the
opportunities
that
serena
possessed
and
my
word
for
it
she
will
succeed
though
she
be
as
ugly
as
original
sin
and
as
shrewish
as
a
virago
and
so
serena
won
the
old
man
heart
hard
ossified
though
it
was
won
it
by
her
kindly
attentions
and
the
way
in
which
she
posed
before
him
as
an
ardent
admirer
of
his
many
sterling
qualities
the
old
man
grew
more
impatient
every
day
over
her
continued
absence
but
he
was
compelled
to
content
himself
with
sending
messages
to
serena
and
ordering
all
sorts
of
dainties
to
be
carried
to
her
room
so
the
days
went
by
and
serena
had
been
out
of
his
sight
for
a
whole
week
and
then
one
morning
she
made
her
appearance
once
more
in
bernard
dane
the
old
man
wrapped
in
his
was
seated
in
an
at
the
window
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
scene
without
a
look
of
sadness
resting
upon
his
face
very
pale
and
worn
at
sound
of
the
closing
door
he
turned
and
as
his
eyes
fell
upon
serena
his
wrinkled
face
lighted
up
with
a
flash
of
joy
he
started
as
though
to
arise
but
he
was
still
quite
weak
and
he
fell
back
upon
the
cushions
once
more
serena
he
exclaimed
is
it
really
you
she
had
really
been
ill
but
not
enough
to
cause
so
long
an
exile
from
the
only
that
had
been
a
part
of
the
game
her
game
which
seemed
destined
to
prove
a
grand
success
i
am
so
glad
that
you
are
able
to
be
up
she
cried
as
she
laid
her
hands
in
his
her
face
was
very
pale
and
its
pallor
was
enhanced
by
a
skillful
application
of
pearl
powder
while
dark
circles
artistically
laid
on
beneath
her
eyes
increased
the
appearance
of
illness
she
wore
a
flowing
wrapper
of
pale
blue
cashmere
and
altogether
serena
who
had
studied
the
effect
long
and
earnestly
was
looking
her
best
and
she
knew
it
she
sank
in
a
low
rocker
at
his
side
and
began
to
question
him
as
to
the
care
that
he
had
received
during
her
enforced
absence
from
the
he
answered
all
her
inquiries
with
real
tenderness
in
his
voice
and
really
the
old
man
was
inexpressively
touched
at
the
thought
that
some
one
cared
for
him
and
surely
lonely
and
old
as
he
was
this
could
not
be
wondered
at
they
conversed
together
for
a
time
upon
indifferent
topics
and
then
silence
gradually
settled
down
broken
in
an
unexpected
way
serena
bowed
her
head
upon
her
clasped
hands
and
began
to
weep
softly
to
all
appearance
repressing
her
emotion
by
a
great
effort
the
old
man
caught
the
sound
of
her
stifled
sobs
and
uttered
an
exclamation
of
dismay
serena
good
heavens
child
he
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
alarm
what
is
the
matter
why
are
you
crying
lift
your
head
my
dear
and
look
me
in
the
eyes
she
obeyed
him
dabbing
her
eyes
with
her
handkerchief
as
she
did
so
as
though
in
shame
and
confusion
at
being
detected
in
such
weakness
as
this
it
is
nothing
she
faltered
brokenly
i
am
going
away
that
is
all
i
ought
to
have
gone
long
ago
but
i
could
not
leave
you
so
ill
and
uncared
for
and
then
i
was
taken
ill
myself
and
i
i
think
it
best
that
i
should
leave
here
at
once
for
i
have
learned
to
to
care
too
much
for
you
dane
this
feeling
must
be
conquered
serena
i
did
not
believe
that
your
expressed
affection
for
me
could
be
anything
serious
oh
mr
dane
she
lifted
her
pale
blue
eyes
to
his
face
with
a
swift
look
of
entreaty
then
they
drooped
again
serena
do
you
wish
to
leave
me
he
asked
anxiously
no
no
i
do
not
i
would
not
go
if
i
could
help
it
she
sobbed
but
i
can
not
stay
in
this
way
dane
it
is
not
proper
i
am
an
unmarried
woman
and
you
you
i
am
old
enough
to
be
your
father
he
exclaimed
but
serena
old
as
i
am
my
heart
is
young
life
is
a
dreary
waste
to
me
alone
serena
will
you
marry
me
it
was
said
the
words
for
which
serena
lynne
had
listened
and
hoped
for
so
long
the
magic
words
which
would
change
all
her
life
for
her
the
question
was
asked
at
last
for
which
she
had
schemed
and
plotted
and
which
she
sometimes
had
despaired
of
ever
hearing
the
question
whose
answer
would
bring
her
wealth
a
grand
home
and
an
honored
name
she
caught
her
breath
with
a
tremulous
gasp
and
one
hand
pressed
her
heart
convulsively
dane
she
cried
you
do
not
mean
it
you
should
not
trifle
with
a
lonely
woman
it
is
cruel
unkind
and
she
knew
perfectly
well
artful
serena
that
this
delicate
flattery
would
be
the
very
shortest
cut
to
the
old
man
heart
that
to
imply
his
possession
of
the
powers
of
attracting
and
winning
the
admiration
of
women
would
be
the
surest
road
to
bernard
affections
in
short
by
appealing
to
his
masculine
vanity
guileless
serena
hoped
to
gain
her
desire
she
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
as
she
spoke
and
pressed
it
gently
the
old
man
eyes
rested
upon
her
pale
sad
face
which
for
once
wore
a
look
of
gentle
tenderness
which
made
her
appear
essentially
womanly
in
the
old
man
eyes
he
lifted
her
hand
and
pressed
it
to
his
lips
i
mean
it
of
course
he
returned
in
a
faltering
voice
i
have
not
cared
for
any
one
in
years
but
your
kindness
has
opened
my
heart
and
made
me
feel
that
there
is
something
on
earth
worth
living
for
i
ask
you
once
more
serena
in
all
honor
will
you
be
my
wife
marry
me
at
once
and
we
will
go
abroad
for
a
time
for
nothing
can
be
done
for
poor
beatrix
by
staying
here
and
keith
life
poor
boy
is
ruined
will
you
be
my
wife
serena
she
bowed
her
head
and
one
little
potent
word
of
three
letters
was
spoken
a
word
which
made
serena
lynne
the
promised
wife
of
old
bernard
dane
chapter
xxvii
keith
hears
the
news
once
decided
in
his
course
old
bernard
dane
was
not
the
man
to
turn
back
or
to
express
regret
for
what
he
had
done
the
die
was
cast
he
had
asked
serena
lynne
to
be
his
wife
and
he
would
make
her
dane
no
matter
what
obstacles
stood
in
the
way
keith
wandered
about
the
house
looking
like
a
ghost
his
mind
so
absorbed
in
the
disappearance
of
beatrix
that
he
had
no
thought
for
anything
else
and
did
not
therefore
perceive
the
state
of
affairs
between
bernard
dane
and
serena
graves
would
have
attempted
to
put
him
on
the
track
of
that
which
the
good
old
lady
saw
was
about
to
take
place
for
she
alone
had
kept
her
eyes
open
and
seen
the
true
state
of
affairs
but
she
shrank
from
being
the
one
to
call
keith
attention
to
the
fact
and
so
no
one
spoke
and
keith
remained
in
utter
ignorance
serena
at
once
began
preparations
for
the
marriage
she
had
decided
that
it
must
be
soon
at
once
bernard
dane
allowed
himself
to
be
persuaded
and
so
all
preliminaries
having
been
gone
through
with
a
clergyman
was
engaged
to
perform
the
ceremony
one
april
eve
but
first
there
remained
the
task
of
breaking
the
news
to
keith
i
ca
do
it
serena
the
old
man
declared
childishly
he
will
be
so
surprised
so
shocked
you
must
tell
him
yourself
serena
pale
eyes
flashed
that
was
just
what
she
wished
to
do
she
felt
a
strange
satisfaction
in
wounding
this
man
who
had
scorned
her
and
whose
fortune
she
was
now
about
to
usurp
very
well
she
made
answer
her
pale
face
growing
livid
as
she
spoke
i
will
break
the
news
to
keith
kenyon
she
left
the
room
at
once
and
went
up
to
her
own
apartment
there
to
stand
for
a
few
moments
before
the
mirror
while
she
scanned
with
true
feminine
criticism
the
details
of
her
own
toilet
she
was
looking
very
well
in
pale
lavender
muslin
she
had
discarded
mourning
with
a
bunch
of
pansies
in
the
yellow
lace
which
covered
the
corsage
her
dull
flaxen
hair
was
in
a
psyche
knot
and
fell
in
a
fringe
upon
her
brow
there
was
a
glitter
of
cruel
triumph
in
her
eyes
and
she
caught
her
breath
with
a
low
cry
of
exultation
serena
you
are
a
trump
she
exclaimed
apostrophizing
her
own
reflection
beauty
is
well
enough
to
possess
but
a
clever
woman
can
overreach
mere
beauty
any
day
well
i
will
go
now
to
the
library
simons
says
that
keith
is
there
and
break
my
important
news
to
that
gentleman
but
oh
keith
keith
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
for
a
moment
not
another
word
passed
her
lips
but
that
one
wild
agonized
cry
revealed
the
bitter
truth
that
come
what
would
she
had
not
forgotten
keith
kenyon
and
had
not
ceased
to
love
him
it
was
the
one
mad
passion
of
her
narrow
empty
life
she
left
the
room
and
went
straight
to
the
library
the
door
was
closed
she
rapped
lightly
upon
it
come
in
called
keith
voice
and
she
turned
the
knob
and
entered
the
room
it
was
nearly
sunset
the
slant
rays
of
gold
which
marked
the
road
taken
by
the
departing
god
of
day
streamed
in
at
the
open
window
and
across
the
bowed
head
of
the
young
man
seated
at
the
desk
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
western
sky
with
a
hopeless
look
in
their
depths
at
sight
of
serena
he
started
up
and
his
face
grew
paler
than
before
any
news
he
asked
swiftly
serena
have
you
heard
anything
of
of
beatrix
have
you
come
to
tell
me
that
she
is
found
serena
stopped
short
suppressing
an
exclamation
of
disgust
always
beatrix
always
beatrix
never
any
thought
of
her
and
there
never
would
be
she
drew
a
little
nearer
the
desk
where
he
was
sitting
and
turned
her
face
away
that
he
might
not
be
able
to
read
its
expression
no
trying
in
vain
to
keep
the
harshness
out
of
her
voice
i
have
no
news
of
beatrix
she
has
probably
taken
her
own
life
and
if
that
be
true
would
it
not
be
better
keith
he
started
to
his
feet
then
sank
back
wearily
once
more
no
no
he
panted
fiercely
it
would
not
nothing
can
ever
make
up
to
me
for
her
loss
nothing
she
is
gone
and
the
light
of
my
life
has
gone
with
her
i
shall
never
be
happy
again
i
am
utterly
and
forever
alone
serena
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
and
lifted
her
white
set
face
to
his
whose
fault
is
it
that
you
are
all
alone
she
demanded
madly
i
would
have
died
to
make
you
happy
keith
but
you
would
not
you
scorned
me
scorned
my
love
and
i
i
have
given
up
all
hope
of
ever
winning
a
kindly
feeling
from
you
so

have
done
the
best
for
myself
that
i
can
keith

your
solitude
to

piece
of
news
which
concerns
me
alone
but
in
which
you
may
be
interested
keith
i
am
going
to
be
married
he
started
and
pushed
back
the
heavy
hair
from
his
brow
with
an
impatient
touch
into
his
dark
eyes
a
look
of
satisfaction
stole
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
that
he
felt
no
regret
for
the
fact
of
miss
lynne
intended
marriage
indeed
he
returned
trying
to
show
some
interest
well
serena
i
am
sure
you
have
my
best
wishes
when
is
it
to
be
tonight
what
is
it
possible
i
thought
of
course
that
the
happy
bridegroom
would
be
some
one
from
the
north
perhaps

has
come
here
to
new
orleans
to
win
his
bride

me
all
about
it

keith
my
intended
husband

not
come
from
the
north
he
lives
here
in
new
orleans
in
short
gazing
full
into
the
young
man
pale
handsome
face
with
eyes
full
of
exultation
and
a
triumph
which
he
could
not
fail
to
perceive
i
am
going
to
marry
bernard
dane
what
keith
sprang
to
his
feet
with
a
cry
of
astonishment
and
dismay
his
face
pale
as
marble
his
eyes
full
of
a
dawning
terror
and
something
which
for
a
moment
made
serena
afraid
be
good
enough
to
explain
he
said
at
last
after
a
long
silence
there
is
nothing
more
to
say
i
am
going
to
marry
bernard
dane
tonight
at
eight
he
is
old
but
i
must
have
a
home
and
protector
and
he
has
asked
me
to
marry
him
the
marriage
will
be
solemnized
in
two
hours
time

all
that

to
say
keith
but
before
she
could
leave
the
room
he
had
opened
the
door
and
strode
over
the
threshold
out
to
the
stables
he
went
his
face
set
and
stern
and
white
as
death
his
eyes
full
of
darkness
he
understood
at
last
her
plot
of
vengeance
knew
it
now
when
it
was
too
late
it
was
the
utter
overthrow
of
all
his
hopes
and
ambitions
he
would
be
homeless
friendless
for
how
could
he
expect
bernard
dane
to
make
him
his
heir
now
when
he
would
have
a
wife
and
perhaps
children
to
inherit
his
wealth
keith
kenyon
had
never
been
a
but
he
had
fully
realized
the
importance
of
wealth
and
position
and
he
had
been
reared
to
believe
himself
bernard
dane
heir
it
seemed
to
him
now
that
the
end
of
the
world
had
come
he
entered
the
stables
and
ordered
his
horse
saddled
it
was
a
new
purchase
a
splendid
thoroughbred
black
as
night
and
well
named
satan
in
his
mad
desire
for
excitement
keith
believed
that
he
could
quench
the
fire
which
was
burning
in
his
brain
he
sprang
into
the
saddle
when
the
groom
led
satan
forth
and
whirled
madly
away
flying
like
the
wind
on
he
went
through
the
most
unfrequented
streets
of
the
city
on
on
the
horse
growing
wilder
and
more
ungovernable
every
moment
in
the
lower
part
of
the
city
it
came
to
grief
it
dashed
into
a
narrow
street
and
threw
its
rider
violently
to
the
ground
upon
the
sharp
chapter
xxviii
beatrix
sees
the
game
they
were
very
busy
that
day
in
the
ward
of
hopeless
cases
beatrix
had
not
had
a
moment
to
rest
all
day
long
the
tired
little
feet
were
running
here
and
there
in
obedience
to
the
nurse
call
the
deft
fingers
rolled
bandages
smoothed
pillows
bathed
throbbing
temples
held
cooling
drinks
to
lips
in
short
accomplished
the
one
thousand
and
one
acts
which
soothe
the
sufferer
and
comfort
even
the
dying
the
office
of
nurse
is
truly
a
grand
one
what
more
noble
position
can
a
woman
fill
than
that
of
comforter
and
consoler
to
help
ease
the
pain
of
serious
illness
and
if
it
can
not
be
assuaged
to
do
all
that
human
power
can
do
to
help
the
poor
sufferer
bear
the
awful
suffering
that
is
his
doom
so
beatrix
feeling
that
she
had
found
her
found
it
in
this
strange
way
and
at
the
very
crisis
of
her
life
when
she
had
been
on
the
point
of
despairing
feeling
that
at
all
events
she
had
found
employment
for
the
present
which
would
help
to
deaden
her
pain
worked
away
with
a
will
and
was
soon
looked
upon
as
one
of
the
most
efficient
and
willing
assistants
attached
to
the
home
today
they
had
been
overworked
for
there
had
been
an
accident
a
falling
building
had
crushed
and
mangled
several
poor
creatures
a
few
blocks
away
and
a
number
of
the
sufferers
had
been
carried
to
the
home
there
to
linger
for
a
time
in
awful
agony
and
then
pass
away
beatrix
grew
as
she
gazed
upon
the
suffering
around
her
her
gentle
heart
touched
inexpressibly
by
the
scenes
and
sounds
the
groans
and
cries
and
moans
and
in
some
cases
more
touching
than
any
other
there
was
quiet
patience
brave
heroism
there
were
those
real
heroes
who
set
their
teeth
hard
together
over
the
groans
that
would
try
to
force
themselves
through
and
bore
stoically
the
tortures
of
the
lost
the
sun
set
upon
that
busy
day
a
day
never
to
be
forgotten
by
beatrix
dane
never
while
she
lived
the
sun
had
set
and
twilight
was
coming
down
and
all
alone
in
the
ward
for
hopeless
cases
beatrix
bent
over
the
haggard
face
of
an
old
woman
a
old
creature
who
while
intoxicated
had
fallen
under
the
wheels
of
a
passing
cab
and
had
been
carried
to
the
home
which
chanced
to
be
nearer
than
the
charity
hospital
beatrix
was
bathing
the
brow
with
cologne
water
speaking
gentle
kindly
words
of
sympathy
all
the
time
when
a
voice
spoke
her
name
a
voice
which
always
had
an
influence
over
beatrix
and
which
she
had
learned
to
love
dearly
sister
angela
beatrix
turned
as
the
sister
laid
her
hand
upon
her
arm
my
dear
the
kind
voice
went
on
gently
you
are
overworked
you
have
done
too
much
today
for
a
novice
you
must
rest
now
go
down
to
the
little
and
you
will
find
some
tea
there
yes
i
insist
upon
it
i
will
take
your
place
here
you
beatrix
dark
eyes
rested
lovingly
upon
the
sister
pale
face
you
are
tired
out
already
sister
you
were
up
all
night
but
i
am
accustomed
to
that
my
dear
sister
angela
returned
firmly
and
i
find
that
the
very
best
way
to
be
of
use
in
this
place
is
to
husband
your
strength
and
keep
some
always
in
reserve
go
now
my
child
you
do
not
know
what
may
lie
before
you
ere
this
night
is
done
were
her
words
prophetic
looking
back
upon
them
afterward
beatrix
could
almost
believe
them
so
she
went
slowly
away
however
for
she
would
not
disobey
the
kind
sister
and
as
beatrix
went
slowly
sister
angela
took
her
place
by
the
old
woman
side
not
until
she
had
reached
the
foot
of
the
stairs
did
the
girl
realize
how
very
weak
she
was
sister
angela
is
right
she
said
to
herself
my
strength
is
not
sufficient
to
keep
up
as
she
does
that
will
come
in
time
she
went
to
the
room
where
she
had
been
directed
and
after
she
had
drunk
a
cup
of
tea
and
partaken
of
some
refreshment
she
felt
better
she
was
about
to
return
to
her
task
when
there
was
a
loud
ring
at
the
followed
by
a
bustle
and
confusion
in
the
entrance
hall
another
case
i
suppose
commented
the
girl
and
she
hastened
into
the
hall
just
as
one
of
the
assistants
came
hastily
to
meet
her
an
accident
she
announced
briefly
a
man
has
been
thrown
from
his
horse
right
in
front
of
the
door
so
of
course
he
was
brought
in
here
and
heaven
knows
we
have
scarcely
room
enough
to
receive
any
more
the
affair
of
yesterday
has
filled
our
wards
to
overflowing
they
were
bringing
the
injured
man
into
the
hall
lying
upon
a
stretcher
the
pallid
face
uncovered
the
eyes
closed
as
though
death
had
already
set
his
seal
there
one
glance
and
beatrix
flew
to
the
side
of
the
stretcher
with
a
wild
cry
which
through
the
house
like
a
knell
but
cries
of
pain
and
anguish
were
of
too
common
an
occurrence
there
to
excite
any
comment
she
fell
upon
her
knees
beside
the
sofa
where
the
injured
man
had
been
placed
and
wrung
her
hands
in
frantic
grief
keith
keith
she
wailed
in
her
wild
bitter
anguish
it
is
keith
my
husband
and
he
is
dead
that
agonized
cry
seemed
to
bring
keith
back
to
life
the
beautiful
dark
eyes
flared
swiftly
open
and
rested
upon
the
white
terrified
face
bending
over
his
own
beatrix
the
name
faltered
from
his
pale
lips
in
one
wild
joyous
outcry
then
the
eyelids
fluttered
down
and
he
was
unconscious
once
more
beatrix
rose
to
her
feet
pale
and
still
take
him
up
to
my
own
room
she
said
turning
to
the
men
who
had
borne
that
still
form
into
the
house
he
will
be
my
especial
he
is
my
husband
then
she
added
after
a
slight
pause
if
you
will
carry
him
up
now
i
will
lead
the
way
they
obeyed
her
without
a
word
and
keith
kenyon
was
carried
to
his
wife
room
and
placed
in
bed
while
the
physicians
took
possession
of
him
and
beatrix
hastened
away
to
tell
sister
angela
the
good
sister
was
pleased
and
glad
for
beatrix
sake
that
this
strange
occurrence
had
taken
place
and
beatrix
would
have
the
privilege
of
nursing
the
man
she
so
dearly
loved
but
the
kindly
face
grew
pale
as
death
as
she
thought
of
the
fresh
complications
that
must
now
ensue
who
could
foresee
the
end
beatrix
took
up
her
position
at
keith
bedside
and
nursed
him
indefatigably
the
days
came
and
went
and
still
keith
lay
there
upon
his
bed
of
pain
through
doctor
darrow
beatrix
was
able
to
send
word
to
old
bernard
dane
as
to
keith
whereabouts
and
condition
though
beatrix
preferred
that
her
own
name
should
be
kept
out
of
the
matter
and
the
message
to
dane
was
sent
purporting
to
have
come
from
darrow
beatrix
could
not
deny
herself
the
privilege
of
nursing
her
husband
even
though
she
knew
that
with
his
returning
health
she
must
go
from
him
again
they
must
separate
and
never
hope
to
be
anything
to
each
other
surely
it
was
the
saddest
the
very
saddest
experience
on
record
but
the
brave
girl
was
strong
in
her
determination
better
far
to
never
see
him
again
than
to
expose
the
life
so
dear
to
her
to
such
a
horrible
fate
it
was
the
very
acme
of
and
abnegation
but
any
true
woman
would
have
done
as
beatrix
did
for
what
woman
who
loves
a
man
will
deliberately
expose
him
to
suffering
of
any
description
mental
or
bodily
and
this
was
such
a
horrible
thing
that
no
wonder
the
poor
girl
feeling
herself
accursed
felt
at
times
almost
tempted
to
take
her
own
life
so
that
she
might
escape
from
the
horrors
of
the
future
and
above
all
put
it
beyond
the
possibility
of
harming
the
one
so
dearly
loved
one
day
not
long
after
keith
arrival
at
the
home
beatrix
was
informed
that
a
lady
and
gentleman
wished
to
see
kenyon
they
were
in
the
and
beatrix
hastened
thither
to
receive
them
she
had
fully
expected
to
meet
old
bernard
dane
and
probably
graves
the
thought
of
serena
had
never
once
entered
her
mind
for
as
keith
was
almost
always
delirious
he
could
not
tell
her
of
the
strange
changes
that
had
taken
place
since
beatrix
had
left
home
imagine
her
surprise
as
she
entered
the
to
see
at
the
old
man
side
serena
the
woman
who
so
cordially
hated
her
serena
her
bitter
implacable
foe
as
beatrix
entered
the
room
old
bernard
dane
uttered
a
wild
cry
of
delight
beatrix
good
heavens
is
it
really
you
he
faltered
brokenly
we
we
thought
that
you
were
dead
she
smiled
but
still
she
observed
with
a
pang
at
her
sensitive
heart
that
he
did
not
come
near
her
or
even
take
her
hand
did
he
fear
contagion
serena
drew
back
as
she
came
near
as
though
she
feared
infection
from
the
girl
presence
how
do
you
do
serena
said
beatrix
quietly
i
did
not
expect
to
see
you
this
is
quite
a
surprise
i
thought
that
you
had
returned
to
your
home
in
the
north
long
ago
this
is
serena
hour
of
triumph
for
the
sake
of
this
moment
of
supreme
satisfaction
she
would
have
given
a
year
of
her
life
she
drew
herself
up
proudly
and
the
pale
eyes
shone
like
glass
i
shall
never
return
north
to
live
her
shrill
tones
made
answer
my
home
is
in
new
orleans
now
have
you
not
heard
do
you
never
see
the
newspapers
i
am
married
i
am
bernard
dane
in
an
instant
beatrix
mind
had
grasped
the
situation
she
saw
at
once
that
this
was
serena
game
of
vengeance
chapter
xxix
serena
failure
as
serena
announcement
was
made
and
the
words
fell
upon
the
silence
with
a
clear
note
of
triumph
pealing
through
her
voice
beatrix
fell
back
faint
and
stunned
she
realized
the
truth
at
once
she
saw
serena
game
and
knew
that
she
had
won
she
saw
that
serena
stung
by
the
fact
that
keith
kenyon
love
would
never
be
hers
and
that
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
led
into
an
engagement
which
he
had
not
desired
and
of
which
he
soon
grew
weary
and
so
had
repudiated
her
all
this
had
made
serena
a
very
devil
and
then
added
to
it
was
the
fact
of
her
own
poverty
and
here
right
within
her
grasp
was
the
chance
to
retrieve
herself
to
gain
a
grand
home
and
a
fortune
and
at
the
same
time
ruin
keith
kenyon
forever
for
the
young
man
had
been
reared
to
believe
himself
to
be
bernard
dane
prospective
heir
and
of
course
with
such
a
rearing
he
was
utterly
unfitted
for
any
position
in
life
where
he
could
earn
his
own
bread
surely
the
future
looming
up
before
him
was
pitiful
to
contemplate
it
was
a
revenge
worthy
of
a
woman
of
a
woman
one
who
has
the
fires
of
baleful
jealousy
burning
in
her
heart
it
is
said
that
a
jealous
woman
is
fit
to
reign
in
hell
and
it
is
easy
to
believe
it
serena
was
half
insane
with
jealous
wrath
and
would
hesitate
at
nothing
in
the
way
of
her
scheme
to
punish
keith
kenyon
for
not
loving
her
as
though
it
were
possible
for
keith
to
control
and
direct
his
own
heart
for
love
is
not
a
matter
of
our
own
volition
it
must
go
where
it
is
sent
by
fate
we
can
not
steer
its
course
and
so
serena
with
her
mad
determination
to
revolutionize
nature
must
needs
attempt
to
wreck
two
lives
already
saddened
by
the
darkest
and
most
bitter
of
sorrows
a
sorrow
more
cruel
than
death
all
this
had
flashed
through
beatrix
brain
as
she
stood
there
her
eyes
upon
serena
pale
triumphant
face
her
heart
sinking
slowly
into
the
very
depths
of
dark
despair
keith
life
was
ruined
ruined
irretrievably
his
fortune
gone
and
the
heavy
clanking
chains
of
a
marriage
which
could
never
be
a
real
marriage
after
all
fettering
his
every
movement
and
she
was
to
blame
for
it
all
in
loving
him
and
giving
herself
to
him
she
had
signed
keith
kenyon
a
fearful
living
death
in
life
she
shuddered
convulsively
and
sank
into
a
seat
i
can
not
congratulate
you
serena
she
returned
at
last
forcing
her
white
lips
to
speak
because
this
marriage
of
yours
is
unnatural
and
wrong
no
marriage
will
ever
be
sanctified
without
love
true
love
and
you
have
wedded
this
old
man
for
his
money
serena
started
angrily
and
the
red
blood
suffused
her
cheek
for
a
moment
you
had
better
choose
your
words
in
addressing
me
she
snarled
i
will
not
bear
your
insults
i
have
come
here
to
see
keith
am
i
to
see
him
or
not
you
can
not
returned
the
young
wife
bravely
he
is
very
ill
and
i
am
his
nurse
i
would
not
permit
any
one
for
whom
he
cared
to
come
to
his
bedside
i
most
certainly
then
will
not
admit
you
her
voice
rang
out
clear
and
determined
serena
face
grew
ghastly
white
and
her
pale
eyes
scintillated
i
will
make
you
sorry
for
that
she
stormed
how
came
you
here
who
constituted
you
keith
kenyon
nurse
i
have
a
right
to
nurse
him
i
and
i
alone
returned
beatrix
calmly
and
besides
that
i
am
a
nurse
or
rather
an
assistant
here
and
it
would
be
my
duty
to
nurse
him
this
is
my
refuge
my
home
a
scornful
sneer
curled
serena
thin
lip
and
do
not
the
sick
people
here
risk
contagion
from
such
as
you
she
cried
it
was
a
cruel
question
but
the
hard
heart
of
the
jealous
woman
was
capable
of
any
cruelty
to
this
girl
who
was
her
rival
who
no
matter
what
serena
did
or
how
she
planned
and
schemed
somehow
always
seemed
to
get
ahead
of
her
without
an
effort
even
now
accursed
as
she
was
with
this
hideous
inheritance
hanging
over
her
head
like
a
sword
she
was
more
blessed
than
serena
for
was
she
not
allowed
to
nurse
this
man
whom
they
both
loved
while
serena
was
shut
out
even
from
a
sight
of
his
face
i
will
see
him
she
cried
angrily
i
will
find
the
matron
of
this
institution
and
demand
to
see
keith
kenyon
i
have
as
much
right
to
him
as
you
beatrix
large
dark
eyes
met
the
gaze
of
the
angry
woman
with
a
slow
calm
scorn
he
is
my
husband
she
said
quietly
serena
eyes
blazed
and
you
what
are
you
she
demanded
accursed
according
to
the
law
of
the
land
he
is
not
your
husband
because
a
creature
like
you
is
an
accursed
thing
set
aside
and
apart
from
other
human
beings
something
too
dreadful
to
contemplate
you
must
be
mad
to
think
that
your
marriage
to
keith
kenyon
is
or
can
be
lawful
any
court
in
the
land
will
give
him
freedom
from
such
as
you
beatrix
could
not
speak
she
could
not
utter
a
word
she
could
only
sit
staring
blankly
before
her
hearing
serena
terrible
words
yet
not
heeding
them
apparently
but
all
the
same
every
word
every
syllable
sank
into
her
heart
like
a
branding
iron
and
stayed
there
perhaps
it
was
true
doubtless
the
courts
of
law
would
give
keith
his
freedom
if
there
was
any
law
to
fit
this
special
and
unusual
case
she
would
try
for
his
sake
she
would
give
him
back
his
freedom
all
this
flashed
through
her
brain
as
she
sat
there
under
serena
scathing
words
saying
nothing
but
hearing
all
old
bernard
dane
intervened
at
length
serena
he
said
in
his
dictatorial
way
this
is
quite
enough
you
have
no
right
to
annoy
and
trouble
poor
beatrix
in
this
fashion
my
child
turning
to
beatrix
with
a
deprecating
air
tell
me
do
you
discover
any
symptoms
of
of
that
awful
trouble
how
is
your
health
my
dear
beatrix
eyes
full
of
mournful
protest
met
his
gaze
i
am
very
well
she
returned
gently
never
was
better
in
my
life
and
i
find
no
trace
of
anything
that
could
ever
so
remotely
resemble
that
awful
thing
to
which
you
refer
it
may
be
in
my
system
but
so
far
i
see
nothing
she
choked
down
the
emotion
which
overpowered
her
and
turned
aside
never
mind
child
do
trouble
yourself
to
explain
to
me
cried
the
old
man
hastily
i
did
not
mean
to
hurt
your
feelings
i
only
wanted
to
know
now
serena
if
you
are
satisfied
i
think
we
had
better
take
our
departure
then
we
can
not
see
keith
beatrix
shook
her
head
he
will
recover
i
feel
sure
she
returned
but
his
recovery
rests
entirely
upon
his
being
kept
quiet
doctor
darrow
says
that
it
will
take
time
several
of
his
ribs
are
broken
and
he
has
sustained
other
injuries
i
will
let
you
know
every
day
how
he
is
uncle
bernard
thank
you
my
dear
thank
you
he
cried
as
he
rose
to
go
serena
said
nothing
but
her
plain
face
wore
a
look
that
was
not
good
to
see
she
only
bowed
coldly
to
beatrix
and
followed
her
liege
lord
from
the
room
a
little
later
the
sound
of
wheels
going
down
the
street
told
beatrix
that
they
were
gone
she
bowed
her
head
upon
her
hands
and
gave
vent
to
a
storm
of
tears
which
she
had
been
bravely
choking
back
heaven
help
me
to
bear
my
burden
she
murmured
softly
heaven
give
me
strength
in
the
meantime
the
dane
carriage
drove
homeward
once
arrived
there
bernard
dane
went
straight
to
the
library
he
opened
the
door
then
started
back
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
the
room
was
occupied
a
slight
figure
all
in
black
sat
at
the
escritoire
with
bowed
head
resting
upon
one
hand
he
drew
near
and
laid
his
hand
upon
her
shoulder
celia
he
exclaimed
celia
ray
what
brings
you
here
she
lifted
her
head
and
her
ghastly
face
ghastly
from
mental
suffering
met
his
gaze
she
rose
slowly
to
her
feet
and
faced
him
like
a
forgotten
sin
come
back
from
its
grave
to
reproach
him
and
so
she
was
bernard
her
voice
was
low
and
tremulous
i
have
only
just
heard
of
your
marriage
your
mad
insane
marriage
to
serena
my
niece
my
niece
remember
and
so
i
came
to
see
you
at
once
now
answer
me
one
question
what
did
you
mean
by
promising
me
never
to
marry
you
refused
to
make
me
your
wife
to
atone
for
the
wrong
you
had
done
me
but
you
did
promise
not
to
marry
any
one
else
you
have
broken
your
word
as
all
men
do
false
false
false
now
listen
to
me
bernard
dane
she
drew
herself
up
to
an
erect
position
and
her
eyes
glared
into
his
face
with
a
look
of
utter
hatred
and
the
worst
hatred
in
the
world
is
that
which
is
born
of
a
slighted
love
her
voice
sounded
like
the
hissing
of
a
serpent
as
she
went
on
i
can
tell
you
something
which
would
alter
all
your
life
and
make
you
happy
but
i
refuse
to
do
it
i
intend
to
punish
you
for
what
you
have
done
go
on
in
your
fool
life
bernard
dane
the
day
is
coming
when
you
will
remember
me
and
curse
the
hour
in
which
you
first
deceived
me
chapter
xxx
a
threat
the
old
man
face
grew
pale
and
troubled
celia
can
not
you
let
be
he
cried
tremulously
i
am
old
and
feeble
i
needed
some
one
to
take
care
of
me
and
as
serena
offered
herself
yes
i
suppose
that
is
about
the
case
all
the
same
i
should
think
that
you
would
have
kept
the
promise
you
made
me
since
that
was
all
the
atonement
you
could
make
for
my
lost
life
my
ruined
happiness
bernard
dane
you
are
a
villain
the
old
man
face
grew
stern
and
a
grim
smile
touched
his
lips
so
i
am
i
do
deny
it
celia
when
i
look
back
upon
my
own
past
and
recall
all
my
awful
deeds
and
worse
than
all
else
the
plot
that
i
had
formed
against
two
lives
the
cruel
horrible
plot
to
ruin
the
happiness
of
two
innocent
hearts
i
hate
myself
i
scorn
myself
i
loathe
myself
celia
you
can
not
speak
one
half
as
bad
of
me
as
i
deserve
but
do
not
arraign
me
for
taking
the
step
that
i
have
taken
i
was
ill
and
alone
you
might
have
sent
for
me
the
woman
cried
passionately
i
would
have
nursed
and
tended
you
but
instead
you
hung
a
around
your
neck
which
will
prove
your
ruin
serena
lynne
is
an
artful
designing
wretch
yet
you
think
she
is
disinterested
perhaps
bernard
dane
i
am
your
wife
in
all
justice
ay
more
she
checked
herself
abruptly
the
old
man
bowed
his
head
and
silence
awful
silence
fell
over
the
room
every
word
that
she
had
uttered
had
stung
his
heart
with
the
full
force
of
truth
and
for
a
time
conscience
that
whip
of
scorpions
stung
him
with
its
bitter
smart
well
it
was
some
satisfaction
to
be
convinced
that
he
still
possessed
a
conscience
he
drew
a
little
nearer
her
side
at
length
and
laid
his
hand
upon
her
shoulder
celia
quite
humbly
he
spoke
her
name
wo
you
try
to
be
less
hard
with
me
i
do
not
deserve
it
from
you
and
yet
he
added
swiftly
at
sight
of
the
expression
which
crossed
her
face
i
acknowledge
that
i
have
wronged
you
and
and
i
had
no
right
to
break
my
promise
but
it
is
too
late
now
i
could
not
atone
under
any
circumstances
now
for
past
mistakes
you
ought
not
to
come
here
to
make
trouble
celia
no
her
eyes
flashed
angrily
i
ought
not
to
make
trouble
for
you
of
course
not
you
ought
to
have
all
the
easy
places
in
life
while
i
toil
along
over
the
rough
stony
road
you
are
like
all
other
men
false
and
selfish
and
cruel
hard
as
iron
all
the
same
i
will
keep
my
secret
the
secret
which
i
have
long
considered
the
advisability
of
telling
you
but
which
i
now
think
wiser
to
bury
in
my
own
breast
it
is
a
secret
which
would
make
your
life
a
happier
one
and
brighten
up
the
skies
immensely
for
other
parties
but
it
will
keep
i
will
do
no
good
no
kindness
to
you
who
have
made
my
life
so
utterly
miserable
a
wretched
failure
i
will
return
evil
for
evil
her
voice
rang
out
harsh
and
hard
her
white
face
was
set
and
stern
she
grasped
the
arm
of
the
chair
in
which
she
was
sitting
as
though
to
gain
strength
low
under
her
breath
she
muttered
softly
if
he
only
knew
if
he
only
knew
dare
i
tell
him
he
looks
so
old
and
worn
the
shock
might
kill
him
she
arose
and
walked
over
to
the
window
and
stood
there
gazing
forth
upon
the
grounds
without
her
pale
face
full
of
grave
trouble
that
there
was
something
upon
her
mind
something
that
troubled
her
and
made
her
very
anxious
there
could
be
no
doubt
she
turned
away
from
the
window
and
began
to
pace
slowly
up
and
down
the
long
room
her
hands
clasped
her
eyes
full
of
brooding
care
i
will
go
she
said
to
herself
at
last
decisively
if
i
remain
here
any
longer
i
shall
be
tempted
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
the
whole
affair
she
turned
abruptly
about
i
am
going
dane
she
said
coldly
he
bowed
his
head
but
made
no
attempt
to
speak
she
turned
away
the
door
opened
and
closed
behind
her
celia
ray
was
gone
out
in
the
hall
she
came
face
to
face
with
serena
ah
mrs
dane
with
a
curious
intonation
in
her
voice
her
steely
eyes
fixed
upon
serena
startled
face
i
must
congratulate
you
ahem
i
suppose
now
you
consider
that
you
have
made
quite
a
grand
match
for
yourself
that
you
have
wedded
a
wealthy
old
man
whose
entire
fortune
will
go
to
you
some
day
in
the
near
future
my
dear
serena
many
a
slip
cup
and
lip
what
do
you
mean
demanded
serena
harshly
nothing
of
course
not
only
some
day
your
eyes
will
see
the
truth
and
you
will
be
astonished
mrs
dane
a
swift
angry
light
leaped
into
serena
eyes
she
turned
away
with
a
wrathful
gesture
just
as
simons
appeared
simons
dane
voice
was
cold
and
hard
show
this
woman
out
and
if
she
ever
ventures
here
again
do
not
admit
her
simons
bowed
i
do
so
suah
he
returned
will
you
retorted
ray
very
well
serena
your
day
is
done
this
insult
is
the
last
straw
that
breaks
the
camel
back
i
will
pay
you
off
for
this
if
i
swing
for
it
she
walked
swiftly
to
the
outer
door
and
waving
simons
aside
opened
it
herself
and
passed
out
her
face
was
white
as
death
her
eyes
burning
like
flame
i
will
hesitate
no
longer
she
muttered
low
under
her
breath
as
she
plunged
on
down
the
street
serena
shall
suffer
for
this
i
will
not
hesitate
for
the
sake
of
shielding
him
i
will
do
the
work
of
destruction
i
will
tumble
down
serena
little
house
of
cards
if
they
had
treated
me
differently
if
bernard
had
been
kinder
and
that
wretch
serena
not
so
insulting
i
might
have
spared
them
i
might
have
continued
to
keep
my
secret
i
have
kept
it
for
years
it
would
have
gone
to
the
grave
with
me
but
the
time
has
come
at
last
and
i
will
tell
if
i
die
for
it
the
words
faltered
into
silence
upon
her
lips
she
had
been
walking
rapidly
down
the
street
and
as
she
spoke
she
was
crossing
to
an
opposite
corner
just
at
that
moment
down
the
long
avenue
a
carriage
came
tearing
drawn
by
a
pair
of
frightened
horses
running
away
on
on
they
came
there
was
the
sound
of
a
fall
a
wild
agonized
cry
of
human
suffering
and
celia
ray
lay
upon
the
stone
pavement
with
the
hoofs
of
the
horses
trampling
her
down
chapter
xxxi
a
noble
love
a
crowd
gathered
in
a
moment
to
the
scene
of
the
disaster
poor
celia
bruised
and
bleeding
body
was
lifted
from
the
ground
and
borne
into
a
neighboring
drug
store
here
she
was
placed
upon
a
sofa
and
everything
was
done
to
resuscitate
her
that
skill
could
suggest
doctor
darrow
chanced
to
be
passing
or
was
it
chance
in
the
days
that
came
afterward
douglas
darrow
was
wont
to
look
back
upon
that
moment
and
humbly
thank
god
for
having
directed
his
footsteps
to
the
place
where
celia
ray
had
been
carried
for
that
occurrence
was
the
beginning
of
a
new
chapter
in
the
strange
romance
a
which
was
destined
to
bring
about
the
end
as
unexpected
as
strange
ray
was
a
stranger
to
the
young
physician
and
all
inquiry
failed
to
elicit
any
information
as
to
her
identity
in
all
the
great
city
she
could
not
have
fallen
into
better
hands
than
those
of
doctor
darrow
for
he
was
the
and
most
philanthropic
of
men
at
last
despairing
of
ever
reaching
the
truth
in
regard
to
the
woman
doctor
darrow
sent
her
to
the
home
for
treatment
he
might
have
sent
her
to
the
charity
hospital
but
there
was
something
in
the
forlorn
aspect
of
the
woman
something
pathetic
it
seemed
to
him
and
there
was
a
familiar
look
about
her
face
which
perplexed
the
doctor
for
he
was
certain
that
he
had
never
met
the
woman
before
yet
the
intangible
resemblance
to
some
one
whom
he
had
met
before
lingered
in
his
mind
and
he
could
not
shut
it
out
so
with
a
vague
feeling
that
it
was
his
duty
to
do
so
he
ordered
the
unfortunate
woman
to
be
taken
to
the
home
where
her
injuries
were
promptly
attended
to
she
was
in
a
very
precarious
condition
doctor
darrow
saw
that
and
he
entertained
grave
fears
for
her
recovery
and
even
in
the
event
of
her
recovery
there
were
serious
fears
entertained
from
the
effects
of
the
blow
upon
her
head
from
the
horse
feet
which
might
result
in
insanity
it
transpired
that
when
beatrix
was
not
with
keith
she
found
plenty
of
occupation
in
the
ward
where
celia
ray
was
confined
to
her
bed
as
soon
as
beatrix
saw
her
she
recognized
the
likeness
to
lynne
save
that
this
woman
face
was
more
refined
and
bore
the
traces
of
sorrow
and
suffering
i
wonder
who
she
is
the
girl
asked
herself
as
she
stood
gazing
down
upon
the
white
face
of
the
sufferer
surely
i
have
seen
her
somewhere
before
she
looks
just
like
lynne
only
there
is
a
difference
even
as
the
words
passed
her
lips
the
woman
turned
uneasily
upon
the
pillow
murmuring
as
she
did
so
bernard
bernard
you
will
not
be
so
cruel
so
cruel
beatrix
started
at
the
sound
of
that
familiar
name
but
the
sufferer
had
wandered
away
again
into
wild
and
incoherent
delirium
and
beatrix
could
gain
no
information
from
the
words
which
passed
her
lips
but
still
some
strange
influence
drew
her
as
often
as
possible
to
the
ward
where
celia
ray
lay
growing
gradually
worse
and
weaker
until
it
became
evident
that
she
had
not
long
to
live
but
there
was
something
upon
her
mind
she
tossed
and
turned
in
the
fever
and
delirium
moaning
and
muttering
broken
fragments
of
a
strange
story
over
and
over
but
so
brokenly
and
fragmentary
that
beatrix
and
doctor
darrow
could
make
nothing
of
her
raving
in
the
meantime
keith
was
recovering
slowly
but
surely
and
now
the
hour
had
come
when
beatrix
knew
that
she
must
have
a
talk
with
him
and
go
through
the
anguish
of
parting
once
more
doctor
darrow
had
listened
to
beatrix
announcement
that
the
injured
man
was
her
husband
and
his
noble
heart
though
crushed
with
its
sorrow
and
loneliness
did
not
shrink
from
the
task
before
him
he
had
devoted
himself
to
keith
kenyon
as
much
as
he
possibly
could
and
to
the
earnest
labors
of
the
young
physician
as
well
as
beatrix
tender
care
keith
kenyon
owed
his
return
to
health
the
time
came
when
beatrix
standing
at
his
bedside
listened
to
keith
pleading
words
words
which
broke
her
heart
afresh
you
shall
not
leave
me
my
darling
the
young
man
cried
passionately
my
wife
my
wife
i
need
you
you
must
not
separate
us
in
this
dreadful
way
this
death
in
life
it
is
worse
than
though
death
itself
had
intervened
to
tear
us
apart
beatrix
look
up
my
beautiful
darling
and
say
that
you
will
give
up
this
mad
separation
it
has
not
been
proven
that
you
are
really
that
you
that
the
disease
is
even
in
your
system
such
things
have
been
heard
of
before
for
two
or
three
generations
a
curse
like
that
may
lie
dormant
and
then
suddenly
appear
just
when
it
had
come
to
be
believed
that
it
had
been
eradicated
it
may
never
show
itself
in
your
my
darling
and
in
any
case
you
are
my
wife
and
i
claim
you
come
beatrix
i
can
not
i
must
not
keith
keith
do
you
know
that
you
are
holding
open
the
very
gates
of
heaven
to
me
and
yet
i
can
not
dare
not
enter
do
you
know
that
i
would
rather
lay
down
my
life
today
than
be
the
cause
of
possible
danger
to
you
oh
my
husband
so
dear
to
me
do
tempt
me
do
tempt
me
or
you
will
break
my
heart
anew
for
i
can
not
dare
not
consent
he
bowed
his
head
upon
his
hands
and
a
storm
of
sobs
shook
his
frame
sobs
which
choked
his
voice
and
made
speech
impossible
beatrix
laid
her
hand
upon
his
head
it
was
to
her
the
very
bitterest
of
anguish
to
stand
at
his
side
and
not
dare
to
let
her
lips
meet
his
in
a
sweet
clinging
kiss
of
love
and
she
had
not
ventured
to
kiss
his
lips
since
that
awful
shock
had
come
crashing
down
upon
her
like
an
avalanche
the
discovery
of
the
awful
shadow
upon
her
life
her
dark
inheritance
she
turned
away
pale
and
trembling
after
a
time
she
crept
back
to
him
and
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
keith
my
own
my
precious
husband
she
whispered
this
is
more
bitter
to
us
than
death
this
parting
but
it
must
be
and
so
since
we
know
that
there
is
no
hope
for
us
that
we
must
be
parted
anyway
would
it
not
be
better
for
you
for
your
future
i
have
none
you
know
to
place
the
matter
in
the
hands
of
the
law
to
appeal
to
the
courts
for
your
freedom
i
am
certain
the
fact
of
my
being
what
i
am
will
be
sufficient
to
free
you
oh
keith
keith
i
can
not
be
a
blight
upon
you
forever
you
must
be
free
from
me
and
hold
up
your
head
once
more
among
your
fellowmen
and
once
free
you
will
some
time
in
the
future
dearest
meet
some
one
else
stop
for
god
sake
stop
how
can
you
speak
such
words
to
me
he
groaned
desperately
beatrix
you
are
my
wife
whether
we
live
as
husband
and
wife
or
are
forever
separated
here
upon
earth
does
not
matter
you
are
mine
and
i
am
yours
no
one
can
alter
that
and
whether
we
live
apart
or
anear
i
shall
always
be
your
husband
yours
alone
until
death
shall
part
us
you
remember
the
solemn
marriage
service
beatrix
and
the
vows
we
took
before
god
holy
altar
never
mention
the
divorce
court
to
me
again
my
beautiful
love
it
is
sacrilege
that
can
never
be
now
beatrix
try
to
cheer
up
and
hope
for
the
best
your
case
may
not
be
hopeless
you
know
and
anyway
no
matter
what
happens
even
though
the
very
worst
remember
that
i
love
you
and
you
alone
and
i
shall
love
you
till
i
die
ah
there
comes
doctor
darrow
i
believe
that
i
will
tell
him
all
our
sad
story
my
beatrix
and
ask
his
advice
and
opinion
he
has
been
so
very
kind
to
me
and
to
his
skill
as
much
as
your
splendid
nursing
i
owe
my
restoration
to
health
for
i
shall
soon
be
well
now
i
am
sure
of
it
i
am
getting
stronger
and
better
every
day
ah
doctor
keith
paused
as
the
young
physician
drew
near
his
face
quite
pale
and
grave
in
his
eyes
a
look
of
something
like
suppressed
excitement
kenyon
he
said
turning
to
beatrix
with
a
look
in
his
sad
gray
eyes
which
touched
her
heart
in
spite
of
herself
will
you
go
to
ray
she
is
asking
for
you
and
i
think
that
there
is
something
upon
her
mind
which
will
not
be
relieved
until
she
has
seen
you
chapter
xxxii
a
death
bed
beatrix
rose
from
her
seat
at
her
husband
side
and
left
the
room
in
obedience
to
doctor
darrow
entering
the
ward
where
ray
was
lying
she
went
to
the
bedside
and
seated
herself
in
a
chair
that
stood
near
the
sick
woman
eyes
were
wide
open
and
fixed
upon
her
face
with
an
eager
look
of
inquiry
as
though
longing
to
ask
a
question
which
after
all
she
feared
to
put
into
words
beatrix
bent
over
the
pillow
and
her
eyes
rested
kindly
upon
the
white
face
you
wished
to
see
me
doctor
darrow
says
beatrix
began
at
once
a
look
of
eager
interest
flashed
over
the
sunken
features
and
one
cold
hand
grasped
the
girl
arm
in
a
grip
her
eyes
glowed
with
a
wild
supernatural
light
her
breath
came
and
went
in
feeble
fitful
gasps
pitiful
to
witness
yes
yes
i
want
to
see
you
i
always
want
to
see
you
she
panted
brokenly
come
come
here
there
child
kneel
down
beside
me
where
i
can
see
your
dear
face
and
and
take
me
in
your
arms
beatrix
you
you
will
surely
not
refuse
my
last
request
no
indeed
if
i
can
ease
your
pain
in
any
way
or
do
anything
for
you
i
will
be
so
glad
beatrix
had
fallen
upon
her
knees
and
pillowed
the
poor
head
upon
her
breast
something
a
strange
unaccountable
feeling
of
something
like
affection
crept
into
the
girl
heart
as
the
worn
cheek
came
in
contact
with
her
own
what
is
it
she
asked
softly
tell
me
celia
ray
eyes
studied
the
beautiful
face
it
seems
strange
she
said
softly
after
a
long
survey
of
every
feature
that
you
should
be
so
beautiful
your
father
is
was
i
mean
anything
but
handsome
and
your
mother
my
mother
was
a
beautiful
woman
interrupted
beatrix
hastily
i
have
seen
her
portrait
she
was
far
too
lovely
to
have
been
my
mother
a
strange
expression
crept
over
celia
ray
worn
face
she
opened
her
lips
as
though
to
speak
but
no
words
passed
them
beatrix
she
said
softly
after
a
slight
pause
i
have
sent
for
you
to
ask
you
to
do
me
a
favor
i
i
have
something
serious
of
the
greatest
importance
to
say
a
confession
to
make
will
you
see
that
i
have
a
notary
and
necessary
witnesses
this
that
i
wish
to
say
is
most
important
it
must
be
placed
upon
paper
but
beatrix
strove
to
be
cheerful
you
will
get
well
ray
doctor
darrow
says
that
doctor
darrow
has
acknowledged
to
me
that
my
chances
are
small
interrupted
celia
hastily
and
in
any
case
i
must
make
this
confession
it
should
have
been
made
long
ago
to
try
and
set
right
a
deadly
wrong
beatrix
wistfully
you
do
not
despise
or
dislike
me
do
you
you
have
nothing
against
me
have
you
dear
beatrix
looked
the
surprise
which
she
could
not
speak
i
good
heavens
no
i
scarcely
know
you
a
look
of
disappointment
and
pain
which
was
not
all
physical
crept
over
the
white
sunken
face
small
wonder
she
muttered
under
her
breath
and
whose
fault
is
it
after
all
then
aloud
she
added
eagerly
i
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
this
that
was
the
reason
why
i
did
not
send
for
doctor
darrow
he
is
good
but
then
he
is
nothing
to
me
after
all
i
am
of
course
only
one
of
his
patients
to
him
he
feels
no
personal
interest
in
me
or
my
fate
beatrix
you
will
care
you
will
have
some
affection
for
me
do
look
so
surprised
i
i
knew
your
mother
i
saw
you
when
you
were
a
babe
many
a
time
i
have
held
you
in
my
arms
for
i
was
your
nurse
you
know
i
was
selected
to
rear
you
and
also
keith
dear
keith
and
now
you
are
his
wife
well
that
is
as
it
should
be
you
did
not
know
that
i
had
nursed
you
she
went
on
swiftly
smiling
feebly
at
the
look
of
astonishment
upon
beatrix
face
but
bernard
dane
knew
and
he
will
tell
you
that
i
am
speaking
truly
you
will
send
a
notary
to
me
will
you
not
she
cried
her
voice
rising
shrill
and
troubled
beatrix
rose
you
shall
have
whatever
you
wish
she
returned
i
will
go
at
once
and
attend
to
it
beatrix
yes
dear
will
you
kiss
me
no
answer
beatrix
turned
away
even
though
this
woman
was
dying
the
girl
shrank
in
her
own
sensitive
way
from
pressing
her
lips
to
those
which
contagion
was
powerless
now
to
injure
i
can
not
she
responded
ray
you
do
not
know
i
am
forbidden
to
kiss
any
living
creature
even
my
own
a
strange
light
flared
into
the
sunken
eyes
god
forgive
me
she
muttered
for
i
alone
am
responsible
for
all
this
but
before
beatrix
could
speak
an
awful
spasm
of
pain
seized
the
woman
and
for
a
few
moments
it
seemed
as
though
the
life
would
leave
the
frail
frame
but
after
a
time
the
paroxysm
passed
and
very
still
and
pale
celia
ray
lay
back
upon
the
pillow
her
eyes
closed
her
breath
coming
and
going
in
panting
gasps
she
opened
her
eyes
at
last
and
fixed
them
upon
beatrix
face
with
an
eager
look
a
devouring
expression
that
made
the
girl
heart
throb
with
a
strange
sensation
which
she
had
never
before
experienced
i
have
never
before
felt
so
strange
an
influence
beatrix
said
to
herself
as
she
met
the
look
of
hungry
affection
from
the
sunken
eyes
celia
lifted
one
feeble
hand
with
a
gesture
toward
the
door
beatrix
understood
i
am
going
now
for
the
notary
she
responded
at
once
do
you
think
that
you
are
strong
enough
to
attend
to
see
him
yes
yes
i
must
be
i
will
be
it
is
a
matter
of
vital
importance
life
or
death
go
at
once
my
child
there
was
a
strange
note
of
wistful
tenderness
in
the
poor
feeble
voice
something
which
touched
an
answering
chord
in
beatrix
breast
and
made
her
feel
strangely
sad
she
left
the
room
at
once
and
finding
doctor
darrow
told
him
of
ray
wish
to
see
a
notary
the
physician
looked
grave
that
there
is
something
of
great
and
serious
importance
upon
her
mind
i
have
no
doubt
he
said
for
i
have
watched
her
closely
i
believe
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
that
it
is
that
which
retards
her
recovery
yet
after
all
her
recovery
is
very
uncertain
i
fear
it
is
out
of
the
question
for
her
poor
soul
i
will
send
a
notary
and
two
witnesses
he
added
hastening
away
half
an
hour
later
a
grave
elderly
man
entered
the
ward
where
celia
ray
lay
still
and
weak
waiting
for
him
to
come
writing
materials
were
soon
brought
and
the
work
began
in
a
low
but
perfectly
distinct
voice
celia
ray
repeated
the
statement
which
she
wished
the
notary
to
transcribe
it
took
some
time
and
it
was
late
in
the
evening
before
it
was
concluded
and
the
paper
signed
witnessed
and
properly
sealed
then
the
notary
arose
to
go
the
sick
woman
sighed
wearily
give
me
the
document
she
cried
eagerly
it
was
placed
in
her
hand
now
send
for
beatrix
she
demanded
in
a
loud
shrill
tone
and
in
the
morning
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
i
must
see
bernard
dane
i
will
not
have
him
disturbed
tonight
for
he
is
old
and
does
not
sleep
well
i
will
wait
until
morning
even
in
dying
the
poor
creature
studied
first
of
all
the
comfort
of
this
man
so
dearly
loved
and
who
had
wrecked
her
life
but
alas
when
morning
came
poor
celia
was
gone
and
bernard
dane
would
never
look
into
her
eyes
or
hear
her
voice
again
she
passed
away
quietly
about
midnight
the
trained
nurse
sat
at
her
bedside
i
want
beatrix
she
cried
lifting
her
head
from
the
pillow
send
her
to
me
i
need
her
it
is
so
dark
so
dark
and
cold
i
will
hold
her
hand
and
then
i
shall
not
be
so
lonely
so
beatrix
was
summoned
from
her
bed
where
she
had
gone
for
doctor
darrow
had
insisted
upon
her
taking
a
good
night
rest
as
it
did
not
seem
likely
that
she
would
be
needed
that
night
she
came
to
the
bedside
of
the
dying
woman
as
soon
as
her
eyes
fell
on
the
gray
pinched
face
beatrix
knew
that
celia
ray
journey
here
was
nearly
done
what
can
i
do
for
you
she
cried
eagerly
celia
opened
her
feeble
arms
come
to
me
my
baby
she
cried
come
to
the
one
who
has
loved
you
so
beatrix
the
clouds
are
lifting
from
your
life
you
will
soon
be
very
happy
tell
me
do
you
hate
serena
beatrix
shuddered
no
i
hate
no
one
she
returned
gravely
it
is
very
wrong
to
do
so
let
us
hope
that
serena
will
be
sorry
for
what
she
has
done
she
will
never
be
sorry
never
until
she
dies
panted
the
dying
woman
wildly
i
know
her
she
is
a
wicked
cruel
woman
she
has
tried
to
break
your
heart
my
darling
for
she
hated
you
for
your
beauty
and
because
keith
kenyon
loved
you
she
is
hard
and
heartless
cruel
and
vindictive
a
wicked
woman
and
she
deserves
her
downfall
beatrix
here
is
the
paper
that
the
notary
executed
also
some
other
papers
of
great
importance
i
leave
all
with
you
you
will
open
them
one
month
after
i
am
dead
by
that
time
so
doctor
darrow
says
keith
will
be
fully
restored
to
his
former
strength
and
health
and
i
shall
be
forgotten
in
my
lonely
grave
no
no
sobbed
beatrix
a
strange
desolate
feeling
touching
her
tender
heart
with
a
pang
of
suffering
a
curious
sensation
that
in
some
way
this
woman
life
sad
lonely
ever
reaching
out
for
something
one
thing
unattainable
was
in
some
way
connected
with
her
own
you
shall
not
be
forgotten
i
will
do
all
that
i
can
i
understand
then
my
baby
will
go
to
see
the
lonely
grave
sometimes
where
poor
celia
sleeps
even
the
name
upon
the
stone
a
false
one
listen
child
i
am
not
poor
and
what
i
have
is
all
for
you
but
your
sister
lynne
began
beatrix
hurriedly
she
has
never
been
a
sister
to
me
panted
the
dying
woman
wildly
and
i
have
carefully
concealed
from
her
the
secret
of
my
life
because
she
was
not
fit
to
share
it
but
no
matter
now
the
papers
will
tell
you
all
now
i
am
tired
and
must
sleep
kiss
me
beatrix
i
am
dying
and
i
am
your
she
strove
hard
with
a
mighty
struggle
to
speak
another
word
but
the
rigid
lips
refused
to
give
it
utterance
the
word
which
was
not
spoken
in
life
could
never
be
spoken
in
death
beatrix
stooped
and
kissed
her
she
smiled
sweetly
and
so
smiling
died
chapter
xxxiii
in
deadly
peril
beatrix
felt
a
strange
sensation
as
she
stood
alone
at
the
midnight
hour
beside
the
dead
woman
it
was
not
terror
it
was
not
the
natural
and
instinctive
shrinking
from
death
death
in
any
form
for
beatrix
had
seen
so
much
of
the
dread
messenger
that
she
had
grown
inured
to
such
scenes
since
she
had
come
to
live
at
the
home
but
still
within
the
girl
heart
there
lingered
a
strange
feeling
of
sorrow
as
though
she
had
lost
a
friend
a
very
dear
friend
she
drew
the
sheet
up
over
the
calm
white
face
upon
the
pillow
but
first
she
kissed
the
cold
cheek
once
more
then
she
took
the
package
of
papers
and
went
swiftly
up
to
her
own
room
the
nurse
who
had
been
in
charge
had
already
hastened
to
give
due
notice
of
celia
death
and
the
poor
body
was
soon
prepared
for
its
last
beatrix
locked
the
precious
papers
safely
away
in
her
own
wardrobe
then
she
threw
herself
upon
her
bed
to
try
and
get
a
little
sleep
she
was
very
tired
and
her
eyes
closed
at
once
and
she
was
soon
in
the
land
of
dreams
strange
land
whither
we
all
stray
at
times
sometimes
with
friends
and
often
with
those
whose
faces
we
do
not
know
and
whom
we
meet
only
in
the
land
of
dreams
beatrix
dreamed
that
night
of
celia
ray
it
seemed
that
the
dead
woman
came
to
her
and
took
her
in
her
arms
and
held
her
close
to
her
heart
whispering
tender
loving
words
and
calling
her
her
baby
and
darling
child
beatrix
awoke
with
a
feeling
that
she
had
been
with
spirits
for
the
presence
of
the
dead
woman
in
her
slumbers
had
seemed
so
real
early
in
the
morning
beatrix
dispatched
a
messenger
to
bernard
dane
with
the
information
of
celia
death
to
her
surprise
the
old
man
himself
made
his
appearance
at
the
home
and
he
came
alone
he
inquired
for
beatrix
and
when
she
entered
the
reception
room
she
found
him
sitting
with
bowed
gray
head
looking
the
very
picture
of
despair
where
is
she
he
asked
abruptly
beatrix
i
will
send
a
burial
casket
and
i
will
have
her
body
brought
to
my
house
the
funeral
services
will
be
held
there
he
would
vouchsafe
no
explanation
for
his
great
interest
in
the
dead
woman
and
beatrix
concluded
it
was
for
the
sake
of
old
acquaintance
that
he
intended
giving
celia
ray
the
grand
pompous
funeral
and
then
was
she
not
serena
aunt
surely
there
was
nothing
very
strange
in
it
after
all
so
everything
was
done
as
the
old
man
directed
the
funeral
took
place
from
the
old
dane
mansion
and
celia
ray
broken
heart
was
laid
to
rest
in
the
howard
cemetery
beneath
a
green
mound
with
white
marble
coping
a
lovely
spot
serena
looked
like
a
galvanized
corpse
during
the
funeral
services
her
pale
eyes
full
of
a
light
she
hated
the
dead
woman
and
began
to
believe
that
she
had
good
reason
to
do
so
for
bernard
dane
was
mourning
as
one
without
hope
over
the
death
of
celia
ray
strange
and
unaccountable
though
it
may
seem
no
sooner
was
she
dead
and
gone
than
bernard
dane
began
to
appreciate
her
great
and
unselfish
affection
for
his
unworthy
self
and
serena
was
aware
of
his
grief
she
watched
the
old
man
as
he
moved
about
the
very
image
of
woe
his
wrinkled
face
pale
and
worn
his
form
trembling
and
during
the
next
four
days
he
grew
to
look
five
years
older
when
the
funeral
was
over
and
and
dane
had
returned
to
their
great
solitary
house
serena
marched
straight
into
the
library
where
her
husband
sat
his
head
grayer
than
ever
now
resting
upon
his
hand
his
eyes
full
of
sadness
now
dane
she
began
at
once
in
her
shrill
sharp
voice
i
want
to
know
what
this
means
i
have
waited
patiently
for
an
explanation
but
i
will
wait
no
longer
i
mean
to
get
at
the
root
of
this
mystery
what
was
celia
ray
to
you
you
can
not
deceive
me
i
know
perfectly
well
that
no
man
would
mourn
over
a
woman
death
as
you
are
mourning
over
hers
unless
there
had
been
something
very
serious
between
them
tell
me
for
i
will
know
she
was
the
only
woman
that
ever
really
loved
me
groaned
the
old
man
desperately
and
i
loved
another
and
turned
from
her
but
she
repaid
me
by
a
of
devotion
and
even
when
she
died
would
not
send
for
me
so
beatrix
tells
me
because
she
would
not
have
me
disturbed
in
the
night
i
have
never
appreciated
her
worth
before
never
i
feel
that
i
have
acted
the
part
of
a
fiend
to
the
best
and
truest
of
women
you
need
not
look
so
angry
serena
i
am
only
telling
you
the
truth
which
you
demanded
i
shall
mourn
for
celia
as
long
as
i
live
which
i
trust
will
not
be
much
longer
i
wronged
her
cruelly
and
i
fear
that
god
will
never
forgive
me
surely
old
bernard
dane
was
a
changed
man
a
few
months
before
such
words
would
not
have
passed
his
lips
old
age
and
the
sorrows
of
his
life
were
crowding
fast
upon
him
now
and
making
him
see
the
folly
of
his
past
and
the
blessings
showered
upon
him
which
he
surely
had
not
deserved
but
serena
felt
in
her
bitter
hatred
that
she
could
reach
out
and
hurt
the
poor
woman
in
her
grave
no
matter
she
cried
angrily
as
she
sat
nursing
her
wrath
to
keep
it
warm
i
am
mistress
here
and
bernard
dane
is
old
and
feeble
it
will
not
take
long
now
that
aunt
celia
is
dead
and
out
of
the
way
to
resume
my
old
power
over
him
i
must
hold
a
tight
rein
or
my
control
will
be
diminished
no
more
of
those
people
shall
be
allowed
here
beatrix
must
never
show
her
face
here
again
she
shall
never
enter
these
gates
while
i
live
that
night
beatrix
retired
earlier
than
usual
she
had
attended
funeral
and
seen
her
laid
to
rest
then
she
had
returned
to
side
for
a
long
and
loving
conversation
she
had
not
been
assigned
any
special
task
that
night
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
she
was
able
to
retire
early
and
was
soon
in
a
sound
sleep
she
was
aroused
from
sleep
by
a
strange
sensation
a
fear
of
approaching
danger
a
curious
tightening
about
the
muscles
of
the
throat
as
though
breath
was
about
to
leave
her
she
sat
up
in
bed
and
peered
through
the
darkness
uttering
a
low
cry
of
horror
as
she
did
so
the
room
was
filled
with
dense
smoke
the
house
was
on
fire
with
a
sickening
horror
creeping
slowly
over
her
the
girl
rose
and
hurriedly
dressed
herself
then
remembering
the
papers
which
dying
hand
had
intrusted
to
her
care
she
removed
the
package
from
the
wardrobe
and
hid
it
away
in
her
bosom
she
opened
the
door
of
her
room
smoke
fire
great
fiery
tongues
of
flame
met
her
on
every
side
choking
gasping
for
breath
she
turned
in
the
direction
of
chamber
which
was
situated
at
the
furthest
end
of
the
hall
from
her
own
could
she
save
him
his
strength
had
not
altogether
returned
to
him
would
he
be
able
to
make
his
escape
even
with
her
help
then
i
will
perish
with
him
she
murmured
desperately
heaven
help
me
heavenly
father
have
mercy
and
direct
me
shouting
wildly
with
all
her
strength
the
one
word
fire
she
fought
her
way
through
the
smoke
and
flame
down
the
long
hall
and
paused
at
last
before
the
door
of
keith
chamber
chapter
xxxiv
a
martyr
fire
fire
fire
the
ominous
cry
rang
forth
through
the
silence
of
the
night
and
instantly
there
was
a
response
close
to
beatrix
side
a
slight
form
glided
swiftly
through
the
thick
black
smoke
with
tongues
of
flame
licking
hungrily
at
her
as
she
passed
a
hand
caught
arm
and
a
voice
cried
wildly
child
child
where
are
you
going
beatrix
turned
to
meet
the
frightened
eyes
of
sister
angela
i
am
going
to
keith
to
my
husband
she
answered
trying
to
calm
her
voice
so
that
the
sister
could
hear
her
above
the
roar
of
the
flames
ah
there
is
doctor
darrow
doctor
save
those
poor
people
below
if
possible
she
went
on
wildly
my
work
is
here
douglas
darrow
came
to
her
side
and
taking
her
hand
raised
it
to
his
lips
there
was
a
strange
expression
upon
his
face
and
his
lips
moved
slowly
as
though
he
were
speaking
in
a
whisper
but
the
words
reached
her
ears
god
bless
and
help
you
he
said
hastily
and
then
he
moved
rapidly
away
and
beatrix
threw
open
the
door
of
her
husband
chamber
over
the
threshold
she
darted
to
the
bedside
and
stooping
she
shook
the
sleeping
man
with
all
her
strength
keith
keith
she
cried
wildly
wake
up
my
darling
the
house
is
on
fire
and
i
have
come
to
save
you
his
dark
eyes
flew
open
with
a
dazed
expression
yes
yes
he
faltered
come
keith
come
she
lifted
him
in
her
arms
and
drew
him
up
to
a
sitting
position
see
she
cried
the
flames
are
approaching
us
and
we
shall
be
cut
off
from
all
hope
of
safety
come
my
darling
he
arose
and
dressed
himself
in
a
moment
the
fire
was
making
fearful
headway
how
it
had
originated
no
one
could
say
but
it
had
the
whole
building
in
its
awful
clutches
and
it
was
evident
that
it
must
be
consumed
below
stairs
doctor
darrow
worked
like
a
hero
doing
all
within
his
power
to
save
the
lives
of
the
unfortunate
sick
people
at
last
after
an
hour
hard
labor
aided
by
the
gallant
firemen
and
the
assistants
belonging
to
the
home
all
the
sick
were
safely
removed
to
a
neighboring
house
which
happened
to
be
vacant
and
whose
doors
were
burst
open
for
the
purpose
by
doctor
darrow
in
the
midst
of
the
bustle
and
confusion
the
din
and
uproar
the
shrieks
of
the
terrified
patients
the
shouts
of
the
firemen
and
cheers
from
the
crowd
gathered
outside
assisting
with
all
the
ardor
of
a
new
orleans
crowd
and
sympathetic
ready
to
do
anything
for
their
suffering
doctor
darrow
forgot
even
beatrix
and
knew
not
what
had
taken
place
sister
angela
too
was
fully
occupied
she
flitted
through
the
rooms
like
an
angel
of
light
helping
cheering
a
very
angel
indeed
the
good
spirits
were
ever
with
her
the
sweet
pale
face
looked
like
the
face
of
a
saint
one
by
one
she
brought
down
and
out
into
safety
the
children
connected
with
the
institution
for
there
was
a
large
ward
set
apart
for
little
ones
and
of
all
the
sufferers
old
and
young
not
one
perished
from
that
night
awful
work
none
were
called
from
this
life
to
the
life
to
come
but
one
who
was
well
prepared
even
sister
angela
when
the
children
were
all
carried
forth
as
was
believed
it
occurred
to
her
that
there
was
one
still
left
within
the
burning
building
a
poor
puny
little
creature
who
had
been
removed
from
the
ward
to
sister
angela
own
room
a
tiny
little
closet
at
the
very
top
of
the
house
in
the
excitement
of
that
awful
night
sister
angela
had
rushed
to
the
rescue
of
the
little
ones
and
had
quite
forgotten
the
sickly
little
babe
sleeping
soundly
in
its
cradle
away
up
in
the
attic
when
all
the
children
had
been
removed
and
the
little
creatures
marshaled
together
in
the
big
empty
house
opposite
one
alone
was
found
to
be
missing
the
little
one
placed
under
the
care
of
sister
angela
the
baby
she
cried
aghast
oh
what
shall
i
do
it
is
up
in
my
room
my
dear
returned
the
elderly
sister
who
shared
sister
labors
i
fear
that
it
is
too
late
that
nothing
can
be
done
see
the
whole
house
is
wrapped
in
flames
i
am
sorry
heaven
knows
but
i
fear
that
we
can
do
nothing
i
must
i
must
at
least
try
sister
angela
was
wringing
her
hands
frantically
oh
sister
i
could
not
live
and
know
that
that
the
child
was
intrusted
to
my
care
god
forbid
that
i
should
be
the
cause
of
a
little
child
one
of
christ
little
ones
losing
its
life
it
seemed
fanatical
for
the
babe
was
a
sickly
little
creature
and
could
not
live
long
at
best
but
the
face
of
sister
angela
white
as
marble
was
set
with
a
resolute
look
it
was
evident
that
she
would
not
be
persuaded
from
her
purpose
i
must
go
she
cried
wildly
i
dare
not
stay
behind
let
me
go
sister
and
if
if
i
never
come
back
remember
that
i
died
in
doing
my
duty
may
god
and
the
saints
have
you
in
their
holy
keeping
said
the
sister
solemnly
and
the
martyr
disappeared
within
the
building
for
a
moment
the
sister
gazed
after
the
vanishing
figure
then
white
and
she
started
to
follow
her
i
can
not
stand
here
quietly
and
see
her
go
to
certain
death
she
cried
i
can
not
do
it
but
as
she
entered
the
burning
house
the
black
smoke
engulfed
her
and
the
fiery
flames
drove
her
back
gasping
smothering
suffocating
she
fought
her
way
out
into
the
open
air
once
more
and
fell
in
a
huddled
heap
upon
the
ground
in
a
dead
swoon
through
the
horrible
smoke
and
flames
the
heroic
sister
made
her
way
it
seemed
as
if
she
would
never
reach
the
attic
the
stairs
had
not
burned
away
the
fire
seemed
not
to
have
reached
them
yet
and
so
she
was
able
to
toil
slowly
and
painfully
through
the
smoke
up
to
the
attic
it
was
a
long
and
weary
task
for
the
black
smoke
was
thick
and
awful
and
the
red
hot
flames
scorched
her
as
she
went
on
on
was
it
hours
or
days
since
she
started
on
on
the
attic
was
reached
at
last
and
blinded
by
the
smoke
and
gasping
feebly
for
breath
sister
angela
threw
open
the
door
of
her
room
the
child
was
lying
in
its
little
cradle
it
had
just
awakened
and
was
crying
bitterly
the
good
sister
flew
to
its
side
and
lifted
it
in
her
arms
it
was
only
a
little
babe
a
sickly
little
creature
born
of
poor
and
unknown
parents
but
it
was
one
of
christ
little
ones
and
this
holy
woman
was
about
to
die
for
its
sake
she
flew
to
the
door
of
the
room
with
the
babe
in
her
arms
held
close
to
her
breast
full
of
the
divine
which
forms
a
part
of
the
nature
of
all
good
women
and
upon
the
threshold
she
came
to
a
frightened
halt
the
smoke
and
flames
filled
the
corridor
and
beyond
beyond
there
loomed
up
a
solid
wall
of
fire
while
smoke
and
flames
wound
around
the
doomed
staircase
and
wrapped
it
in
crimson
folds
for
a
moment
the
heroic
woman
stood
still
holding
the
child
in
her
arms
the
child
for
whom
and
with
whom
she
was
about
to
die
her
eyes
fixed
helplessly
upon
the
staircase
cut
off
from
all
hope
then
she
went
swiftly
back
to
the
room
and
over
to
the
one
window
she
flung
it
open
and
still
clasping
the
child
stood
there
uttering
piercing
shrieks
some
one
heard
her
and
a
ladder
was
swung
up
at
once
sister
angela
drew
forth
her
rosary
and
with
the
child
held
close
to
her
breast
began
to
pray
her
face
like
the
face
of
a
saint
reflected
in
the
lurid
light
from
the
conflagration
the
ladder
was
adjusted
but
too
late
the
flames
darted
forth
and
seized
it
in
deadly
embrace
the
whole
house
tottered
now
upon
its
foundations
only
the
white
face
of
the
sister
at
the
upper
window
with
the
child
in
her
arms
that
picture
will
be
remembered
by
those
who
saw
it
to
their
dying
day
only
a
poor
obscure
sister
of
charity
a
lowly
life
lived
out
amid
the
poor
and
the
fallen
and
suffering
but
who
shall
say
that
it
was
lived
in
vain
and
now
another
ladder
was
swung
but
just
as
one
of
the
brave
and
heroic
firemen
was
about
to
step
upon
it
and
risk
his
own
life
in
a
mad
attempt
to
save
the
heroic
woman
above
the
structure
trembled
violently
and
the
burning
house
gave
way
the
entire
wing
of
the
building
falling
with
a
horrible
crash
and
the
white
saintly
face
at
the
upper
window
with
the
babe
upon
her
breast
the
pale
lips
framing
prayers
while
the
enraptured
eyes
gazed
far
above
at
that
heaven
which
she
was
so
soon
to
enter
was
seen
no
more
will
never
be
seen
again
in
this
world
out
in
the
cool
night
air
beatrix
had
managed
to
drag
keith
but
at
last
he
had
fallen
faint
and
exhausted
to
the
ground
and
beatrix
fell
upon
her
knees
at
his
side
the
first
faint
gleam
of
the
early
morning
began
to
creep
into
the
eastern
sky
and
still
the
crowd
lingered
about
the
smoking
ruins
though
there
seemed
no
more
to
be
done
beatrix
was
making
up
her
mind
to
send
for
a
cab
in
which
to
convey
keith
to
his
home
at
old
bernard
dane
it
was
the
place
for
him
to
go
but
she
she
must
she
seek
refuge
in
that
horrible
place
the
lepers
hospital
after
all
it
was
a
grewsome
thought
and
as
she
realized
what
it
meant
to
her
and
to
keith
the
endless
separation
the
death
in
life
for
the
first
time
since
she
had
learned
of
this
awful
sorrow
her
own
dark
inheritance
the
poor
girl
felt
that
she
could
curse
god
and
die
and
how
could
she
know
of
the
great
good
in
store
the
wonderful
and
unexpected
blessing
which
god
was
about
to
bestow
upon
her
so
it
often
is
with
us
poor
mortals
just
at
the
darkest
hours
of
our
lives
the
light
is
breaking
though
hidden
from
our
eyes
at
last
doctor
darrow
and
burned
in
several
places
made
his
way
to
beatrix
side
he
gazed
full
into
her
face
with
a
strange
intent
look
as
though
seeking
to
read
her
very
heart
from
his
lips
there
issued
a
low
cry
which
sounded
like
a
cry
of
joy
god
be
praised
he
ejaculated
beatrix
listen
to
me
out
of
all
this
evil
some
good
has
come
you
have
been
unconsciously
subjected
to
the
fire
test
and
you
are
burned
severely
burned
get
down
on
your
knees
and
thank
god
for
those
scars
dear
beatrix
for
they
prove
a
glorious
truth
had
you
escaped
from
the
fire
uninjured
there
would
have
been
no
doubt
that
the
horrible
scourge
of
leprosy
existed
in
your
system
but
beatrix
beatrix
you
are
badly
burned
and
look
up
dear
friend
you
are
free
from
the
taint
of
leprosy
there
is
no
mistake
chapter
xxxv
how
the
news
was
received
pale
and
dazed
beatrix
gazed
into
the
young
physician
face
could
it
be
possible
were
his
words
true
was
there
a
hope
that
she
might
after
all
escape
the
dreadful
scourge
the
awful
curse
and
be
restored
to
her
rightful
place
in
the
world
no
longer
an
outcast
no
longer
looked
upon
as
a
thing
of
horror
an
object
of
aversion
it
seemed
too
good
to
be
true
she
fell
backward
a
little
trembling
like
a
leaf
doctor
darrow
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
placed
her
on
a
seat
near
by
keith
who
had
recovered
from
the
swoon
into
which
he
had
fallen
after
his
rescue
from
the
burning
building
could
only
gaze
into
her
face
not
able
to
speak
a
word
let
us
drive
at
once
to
dane
doctor
darrow
voice
broke
the
silence
which
followed
i
will
explain
to
dane
and
i
see
no
reason
why
you
should
not
be
restored
to
your
old
place
there
mrs
kenyon
her
eyes
met
his
with
a
look
of
gratitude
then
all
at
once
it
flashed
across
her
mind
that
the
old
house
had
a
new
ruler
now
serena
was
its
real
head
its
tyrannical
mistress
could
she
go
back
there
would
serena
allow
it
and
could
she
be
happy
under
the
same
roof
which
serena
claimed
as
her
own
in
a
few
words
she
expressed
her
doubts
and
fears
keith
eyes
flashed
if
you
do
not
accompany
me
i
shall
not
go
there
he
exclaimed
so
that
settles
it
where
you
go
beatrix
i
shall
go
no
one
shall
separate
us
again
and
if
doctor
darrow
is
right
in
his
conjectures
there
is
no
longer
the
shadow
of
a
reason
for
our
separation
beatrix
darling
wife
happy
days
are
drawing
near
thank
god
a
cab
having
arrived
doctor
darrow
helped
the
two
into
it
and
took
his
own
seat
opposite
i
had
better
go
with
you
he
said
for
i
wish
to
explain
to
dane
it
is
time
that
this
cloud
should
be
lifted
from
life
we
will
be
only
too
glad
to
have
you
accompany
us
returned
keith
heartily
and
so
they
drove
away
together
away
from
the
ruins
of
the
home
the
funeral
pyre
of
one
of
the
noblest
of
women
and
were
soon
in
the
aristocratic
portion
of
the
city
at
last
the
cab
halted
before
the
door
of
the
dane
mansion
a
dilapidated
trio
hatless
soiled
and
weary
they
were
ushered
into
the
presence
of
and
bernard
dane
at
sight
of
the
visitors
serena
arose
majestically
simons
in
a
commanding
tone
these
people
are
not
received
here
show
them
out
serena
old
bernard
dane
darted
forward
his
face
pale
his
form
trembling
you
are
going
a
little
too
far
these
are
my
adopted
son
and
daughter
i
forbid
you
to
insult
or
show
them
any
rudeness
doctor
darrow
is
a
highly
prized
friend
be
seated
all
of
you
simons
bring
some
wine
and
a
little
cold
chicken
or
something
to
refresh
us
we
had
just
read
in
the
morning
paper
of
the
fire
he
added
turning
to
keith
as
he
spoke
i
was
about
to
go
and
see
what
had
become
of
you
but
the
paper
stated
that
no
one
was
killed
no
lives
lost
in
the
flames
but
the
good
sister
of
charity
and
the
little
child
so
i
felt
relieved
upon
that
score
ah
here
comes
simons
now
you
all
must
eat
and
drink
for
i
must
confess
you
look
pretty
badly
used
up
they
needed
no
second
invitation
and
when
the
repast
was
over
and
they
felt
strengthened
and
refreshed
doctor
darrow
proceeded
to
tell
his
story
ending
by
expressing
his
opinion
professionally
that
beatrix
had
escaped
the
awful
scourge
i
think
that
there
is
no
room
for
doubt
upon
the
subject
the
physician
said
in
conclusion
i
have
never
known
the
fire
test
to
fail
doctor
de
trobriand
told
me
of
it
intervened
old
bernard
dane
excitedly
he
said
that
if
i
could
in
any
way
expose
beatrix
to
the
action
of
fire
i
would
prove
beyond
a
doubt
if
she
were
really
afflicted
with
leprosy
you
understand
my
cruel
treatment
of
you
now
beatrix
do
you
not
that
night
long
ago
when
i
tried
to
induce
you
to
put
your
hand
into
the
fire
yes
i
remember
uncle
bernard
she
returned
and
i
must
confess
that
at
the
time
i
was
awfully
frightened
i
thought
that
you
had
suddenly
lost
your
reason
no
wonder
the
old
man
smiled
grimly
and
now
i
suppose
you
all
need
rest
and
beatrix
certainly
must
have
those
burns
dressed
lucky
that
her
face
has
escaped
injury
go
upstairs
to
the
blue
room
beatrix
but
serena
barred
the
way
i
am
mistress
here
she
snarled
and
i
say
that
no
leprous
person
shall
remain
under
my
roof
it
was
proved
beyond
a
doubt
that
her
mother
mildred
dane
was
afflicted
with
the
dreadful
disease
how
then
do
you
know
how
soon
it
will
show
itself
in
beatrix
her
child
the
parent
always
transmits
the
disease
to
the
children
there
is
no
mistake
upon
that
point
no
avoiding
the
truth
you
are
mistaken
doctor
darrow
voice
broke
in
upon
serena
angry
tirade
i
beg
your
pardon
for
the
contradiction
dane
but
you
are
mistaken
let
me
give
you
an
instance
of
the
truth
which
proves
that
the
disease
is
not
always
transmitted
to
the
children
direct
from
the
parents
it
may
lie
in
abeyance
for
two
or
three
generations
and
then
appear
in
the
next
the
story
that
i
am
about
to
relate
to
you
with
your
permission
is
true
and
i
repeat
it
from
the
written
notes
of
a
physician
a
friend
of
mine
who
was
well
acquainted
with
the
parties
concerned
i
used
to
know
a
cuban
hero
a
revolutionist
who
had
been
run
out
of
his
native
island
by
the
government
he
was
the
son
of
a
rich
planter
had
been
well
educated
in
france
and
spain
and
had
many
accomplishments
he
went
to
new
york
and
into
the
cigar
business
and
soon
became
wealthy
he
married
a
new
york
girl
and
had
a
family
he
had
grown
to
be
immensely
rich
and
lived
in
grand
style
drove
blooded
horses
and
owned
his
own
one
night
he
had
a
long
consultation
with
the
family
physician
in
a
private
room
in
his
elegant
mansion
when
the
doctor
left
the
cuban
said
to
his
wife
in
a
careless
tone
us
go
down
to
delmonico
my
dear
and
have
supper
they
went
and
the
two
passed
the
gayest
merriest
evening
imaginable
a
little
after
midnight
they
returned
home
she
went
to
bed
and
fell
asleep
the
lights
still
burning
in
the
house
just
as
the
first
faint
streaks
of
dawn
began
to
appear
in
the
eastern
sky
she
awoke
with
a
cold
chill
creeping
over
her
some
instinct
warned
her
that
evil
had
occurred
she
rose
and
sought
her
husband
she
found
him
in
his
private
room
lying
on
the
floor
stone
dead
with
a
revolver
still
grasped
in
one
cold
hand
he
had
spent
the
night
arranging
his
affairs
he
had
left
her
many
tender
messages
which
told
of
his
love
for
her
and
his
children
and
tender
kisses
for
the
dear
ones
whose
lips
he
dared
not
press
himself
that
interview
with
his
family
physician
had
betrayed
the
secret
to
him
leprosy
which
had
occurred
among
his
ancestors
generations
before
had
declared
itself
in
him
and
he
had
taken
the
shortest
way
of
doctoring
it
chapter
xxxvi
all
well
there
was
silence
in
the
room
when
doctor
darrow
finished
his
story
silence
broken
at
length
by
serena
cold
harsh
voice
but
that
does
not
prove
that
beatrix
is
exempt
from
the
curse
entailed
upon
her
she
said
coarsely
i
consider
her
unfit
to
associate
with
other
people
until
the
exact
truth
is
proved
and
i
decline
to
receive
her
here
in
my
house
i
will
not
expose
myself
and
others
to
possible
contagion
and
besides
the
very
thought
of
having
such
a
horror
under
one
roof
is
not
agreeable
i
can
tell
you
i
think
doctor
darrow
that
you
as
a
physician
would
be
better
employed
with
something
else
than
in
trying
to
impose
a
case
like
this
upon
dane
and
myself
doctor
darrow
colored
i
assure
you
dane
he
began
coldly
that
kenyon
is
free
from
the
awful
taint
you
need
not
be
uneasy
but
serena
only
tossed
her
head
with
a
sneer
i
do
not
intend
to
be
she
cried
kenyon
is
nothing
to
me
it
does
not
matter
to
me
what
becomes
of
her
she
has
made
trouble
always
she
went
but
she
shall
certainly
not
remain
under
my
roof
mrs
dane
keith
kenyon
came
to
serena
side
and
gazed
into
her
angry
face
with
eyes
full
of
calm
contempt
you
need
say
no
more
my
wife
shall
not
trouble
you
or
infringe
upon
your
hospitality
any
longer
than
is
absolutely
necessary
for
she
is
not
altogether
penniless
ray
bequeathed
her
little
property
to
beatrix
aunt
celia
serena
voice
rang
out
shrill
and
sharp
oh
no
keith
that
is
impossible
she
has
always
intended
mamma
to
have
her
property
and
mamma
is
her
only
relative
and
according
to
law
is
entitled
to
the
estate
ray
will
says
differently
returned
keith
coldly
it
matters
little
to
us
however
we
can
exist
without
the
legacy
but
these
are
cold
facts
dane
as
i
will
prove
to
you
at
any
time
but
we
will
not
trouble
you
now
or
remain
as
unwelcome
guests
come
beatrix
bernard
dane
sprang
forward
pale
and
excited
no
you
shall
not
go
he
cried
this
is
my
house
nay
more
it
is
yours
beatrix
you
shall
not
go
do
not
mind
what
serena
says
you
have
more
right
here
than
she
has
mr
dane
serena
voice
trembled
with
suppressed
anger
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
this
old
bernard
dane
faced
the
angry
woman
with
unflinching
eyes
at
that
very
moment
beatrix
slight
form
began
to
sway
unsteadily
and
she
fell
to
the
floor
in
a
dead
faint
good
heavens
cried
bernard
dane
excitedly
here
we
stand
dickering
over
a
foolish
matter
and
poor
beatrix
is
suffering
doctor
her
burns
must
be
attended
to
at
once
graves
will
help
her
to
bed
she
must
be
taken
care
of
doctor
darrow
was
already
busily
engaged
in
removing
the
scorched
and
tattered
bodice
of
beatrix
dress
from
about
the
beautiful
white
neck
and
arms
as
he
did
so
a
package
of
papers
fell
from
the
bosom
of
her
dress
to
the
floor
bernard
dane
stooped
and
picked
them
up
it
was
the
package
of
papers
which
celia
ray
had
intrusted
to
the
care
of
beatrix
as
his
eyes
fell
upon
these
papers
the
old
man
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
drawing
his
spectacles
from
his
pocket
he
put
them
on
and
eagerly
opened
the
package
good
heavens
he
ejaculated
then
turning
aside
he
sank
into
a
seat
and
began
to
read
the
papers
carefully
he
started
up
and
faced
serena
pale
and
trembling
listen
he
cried
in
an
awful
voice
and
before
you
enact
the
rôle
of
grand
lady
and
turn
your
betters
from
your
doors
first
find
out
if
they
are
your
doors
serena
lynne
go
home
to
your
mother
as
soon
as
you
see
fit
you
have
no
right
here
you
are
not
my
wife
a
horrible
silence
fell
over
the
room
and
over
the
astonished
group
unable
to
speak
serena
stood
glaring
into
the
old
man
angry
face
explain
uncle
bernard
said
keith
i
will
in
the
first
place
i
must
confess
my
own
crime
years
ago
celia
ray
first
began
to
care
for
me
but
i
was
madly
in
love
with
mildred
dane
and
would
not
think
of
any
other
woman
still
celia
continued
to
care
for
me
and
her
love
lived
as
long
as
she
did
it
was
the
only
unselfish
affection
ever
bestowed
upon
me
but
i
was
a
villain
and
although
at
last
seeing
that
my
love
for
mildred
was
vain
i
consented
to
make
celia
my
wife
secretly
resolved
that
the
marriage
should
not
be
legally
solemnized
i
have
nothing
to
say
in
extenuation
of
my
own
villainy
only
i
have
suffered
since
that
time
more
pangs
of
conscience
than
enough
to
atone
well
the
marriage
was
gone
through
with
and
she
believed
herself
my
wife
one
child
was
born
to
us
a
girl
who
died
in
infancy
after
a
time
i
told
her
the
truth
that
we
were
not
legally
married
and
that
we
had
better
separate
she
went
away
and
for
years
we
did
not
meet
and
now
she
is
dead
and
it
is
too
late
to
atone
but
these
papers
prove
beyond
a
doubt
a
surprising
truth
which
she
knew
for
years
but
was
too
proud
to
break
to
me
she
only
begged
me
never
to
marry
and
trusted
to
my
honor
to
keep
my
word
but
here
is
the
truth
our
marriage
was
legal
here
is
every
proof
serena
you
have
never
been
my
wife
the
fortune
for
which
you
married
me
could
not
be
yours
anyway
for
the
wealth
in
my
possession
was
willed
to
me
by
mildred
dane
as
she
inherited
it
from
my
relative
godfrey
dane
and
it
was
long
ago
given
to
keith
kenyon
by
deed
of
gift
doctor
darrow
was
eagerly
glancing
over
the
papers
in
his
hand
all
at
once
he
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
listen
he
panted
breathlessly
why
it
is
miraculous
and
then
he
went
on
to
read
celia
ray
dying
confession
when
bernard
dane
had
taken
poor
mildred
and
her
child
to
the
distant
north
hoping
to
prolong
her
life
for
a
time
celia
had
followed
them
it
was
mildred
child
that
had
died
and
celia
had
substituted
her
own
in
place
of
it
for
she
had
falsely
represented
that
it
was
dead
with
the
hope
of
bringing
about
a
substitution
some
day
so
the
truth
dawned
upon
the
group
and
beatrix
recovered
from
her
swoon
listened
with
bated
breath
and
it
seemed
more
than
bernard
dane
could
bear
this
sudden
change
from
grief
to
happiness
beatrix
was
his
own
child
celia
ray
little
child
the
tainted
blood
of
mildred
dane
ancestors
did
not
flow
in
her
veins
every
necessary
proof
accompanied
ray
deposition
there
was
no
room
for
doubt
and
so
the
black
clouds
rolled
away
from
the
lives
of
beatrix
and
keith
the
two
who
had
loved
each
other
so
devotedly
and
who
had
so
nearly
been
parted
by
an
awful
fate
and
beatrix
thanked
god
that
she
had
been
permitted
to
cheer
her
dying
mother
pathway
to
the
grave
serena
and
lynne
left
new
orleans
forever
and
returned
to
the
north
but
first
beatrix
nobly
settled
upon
them
the
little
fortune
which
celia
ray
her
own
mother
how
strange
it
all
seemed
had
bequeathed
to
her
and
now
as
happy
as
mortals
can
be
beatrix
and
keith
kenyon
live
in
the
grand
old
dane
mansion
with
the
old
man
whose
wickedness
had
so
nearly
wrecked
both
their
lives
he
is
a
repentant
old
man
now
good
and
kind
to
everybody
doctor
darrow
is
a
welcome
visitor
there
and
a
bonny
boy
with
soft
dark
eyes

golden
hair

a
tot
of
